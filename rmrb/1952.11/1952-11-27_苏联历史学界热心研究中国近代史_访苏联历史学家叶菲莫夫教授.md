    Soviet Historical Circles Enthusiastically Study Modern Chinese History
    ——An Interview with Soviet Historian Professor Yefimov
    Sha Ying
    On the afternoon of November 5th, we visited Professor Yefimov of Leningrad University, a member of the Soviet cultural workers delegation, with unusual excitement.
    Yefimov is the head of the Department of Far Eastern History at Leningrad University in the Soviet Union. He has been studying Chinese history for more than twenty years, and is the author of books such as "Modern Chinese History." He is a famous Soviet historian. He was one of the Soviet peace representatives who attended the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing in early October. Now he is participating in China's "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities as a member of the Soviet cultural workers delegation. He is not only an outstanding scholar, but also a distinguished peace fighter.
    Because we were about to meet a noble friend, a sense of reverence made me a little nervous before we met. However, when he appeared before us, shaking hands with us kindly, his eyes flashed with affectionate light, a kind smile hung on his face, and especially his warm words, the language barrier between us completely disappeared invisibly. We felt very relaxed and warm, as if we were sitting in the home of a close friend.
    When we asked him about the research situation of Soviet historical circles on Chinese history and Oriental history, he pondered for a moment and then talked to us. He spoke so calmly, interspersing vivid examples in simple sentences; he sometimes explained repeatedly and patiently, for fear that we would not be able to understand his every word due to language limitations. He tried his best to convey all the profound friendship and warm concern of the Soviet people for the Chinese people.
    "In the Soviet Union, in the past twenty-seven years, there has been a great interest in the history of China, especially after the victory of the great Chinese People's Revolution, the study of Chinese history in the Soviet Union has formed a climax." He went on to say: Because Soviet young students and the general public are eagerly eager to further understand Chinese history, especially the glorious deeds of the heroic struggle of the Chinese people in recent decades, Soviet historians believe that it is an unparalleled honor to do their best to help the Soviet people satisfy this desire. In many universities and specialized schools in the Soviet Union, there are institutions for studying Chinese history and Oriental history. Many historians and research workers are actively studying. They often hold academic seminars on Chinese historical issues, publish many articles expounding Chinese historical issues in newspapers and periodicals, and many people are also engaged in translating the works of Chinese historians.
    Yefimov gave us a general introduction to the situation of the Moscow Oriental Institute and the Leningrad University Oriental Institute, which he was familiar with: The Moscow Oriental Institute has three departments—the History Department, the Economics Department, and the Literature Department. Among them, the History Department mainly studies Chinese history, and the study of Chinese literature also occupies a very important position in the Literature Department. Their "Scientific Bulletin" often publishes articles on Chinese historical issues. This year they held two academic seminars, one to discuss "When did Chinese feudal society form?" and one to discuss "The reasons for the failure of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom." At each seminar, the speeches were very enthusiastic. They were very interested in the division of Chinese historical stages. For example, the study of the question "When did Chinese feudal society form?" aroused a very heated debate. Professors, lecturers, and graduate students at the Leningrad University Oriental Institute are now focusing on the study of Chinese history in the past century, and will also study ancient Chinese history in the future. Their "Historical Issues" magazine and "Leningrad University Bulletin" also publish many papers on Chinese historical issues. In the winter of 1951, they enthusiastically discussed the "Question of the Formation of Oriental Nations." Everyone specifically analyzed the specific formation process of Oriental nations in accordance with Stalin's scientific definition of the national question. Yefimov emphasized that when studying these issues, Comrade Mao Zedong's works have been of great help to Soviet historical circles in studying Chinese history and Oriental history.
    Yefimov said: The number of books on Chinese history published in the Soviet Union is increasing day by day. The book "American Imperialism is the Deadly Enemy of the Chinese People" by historian Dumen and the article "British Imperialism's Aggression against China" written by Ryetkin have had a great impact on Soviet readers. He said: Before he came to China, the two-volume "New History of Oriental Countries" was published in the Soviet Union, in which important chapters expounded Chinese history. The book "A Brief History of the Chinese People's Liberation Struggle" written by Г·Б·Erenburg introduced the glorious history of the Chinese people's struggle in concise language, and is also very popular among Soviet readers. He particularly pointed out: The translation of the first volume of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" into Russian and its publication in the Soviet Union was a major event for Soviet historians who study Chinese history. Everyone studied it carefully with an extremely serious attitude. Soviet historical circles also attach great importance to the works of progressive Chinese historians. For example, the works of Guo Moruo, Chen Boda, Fan Wenlan, Hu Sheng, and Liu Dannian have all been translated in the Soviet Union, and Hua Gang's "History of the Chinese National Liberation Movement" is also being translated. Speaking of this, Yefimov expressed his heartfelt praise for the hard work of Chinese historians.
    When the reporter asked him to talk about his own process of studying Chinese history, he said with great enthusiasm: As early as 1932, he began to study Chinese history, and taught this course in the university in 1935. In order to systematically and deeply study Chinese history, he spent a lot of energy learning Chinese in order to be able to directly read Chinese books. From 1940, he has continuously published articles and works on Chinese historical issues in Soviet newspapers and periodicals. He has given many reports on Chinese history in factories, mines, schools, and troops throughout the Soviet Union. In 1949, he published his magnum opus "Modern Chinese History," and in 1951 he published the second edition of the book. He said: "In order to write this book, I have read all the classic works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin on China and colonial and semi-colonial issues, and collected as many works of Comrade Mao Zedong as possible to study. In 1949, I obtained a copy of the 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' published in Dalian, which was a treasure to me and was of great benefit to me. In addition, I also tried to read many documents of the Chinese Communist Party and the speeches of its leading comrades, and widely referred to the works of progressive Chinese historians." From here, we can know how serious his writing attitude is and how much he loves Chinese history.
    This time he came to China, he visited many historical sites in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places, collected a large number of historical materials, and exchanged opinions with many Chinese historians. He said that this has been of great benefit to his future research work. He said sincerely that he had gained many new understandings after coming to China this time, "Therefore, after returning to the Soviet Union, the first task is to revise the book 'Modern Chinese History' to make it more substantial and complete." This fully demonstrates a scholar's extremely valuable humble attitude and realistic spirit.
    Yefimov briefly introduced to us the research situation of Soviet historical circles in recent years. He said: Since the publication of Comrade Stalin's great works "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics" and the recent "Problems of Socialist Economy in the Soviet Union," the promotion effect on Soviet historical circles has been extremely great. They must not only carefully study these works of Comrade Stalin, but also follow Stalin's new development and contribution to Marxism-Leninism to solve the new tasks put forward in front of Soviet historians. He emphasized that we must study the particularities of various countries separately within the unified whole of world history, and we must creatively study the history of various countries according to the scientific historical materialist viewpoint and method. He also emphasized that Soviet historical circles attach special importance to the development of criticism and self-criticism, which is the driving force for the continuous progress of historical research work, and absolutely does not allow the existence and development of that kind of liberalism of harmony and mutual flattery.
    He also told us that Soviet historical circles, now with the historians of the History Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences as the center, while absorbing historians from all over the country to participate, are preparing to compile books such as "A General History of the World," "The History of Moscow," "The History of Leningrad," and will focus on studying the formation of various nations and the history of the workers' movement in various countries, the party history of the Communist Parties of various countries, and the history of economic development in various countries. The historians of Leningrad University are now engaged in the study of the history of international relations. The Oriental Institute of the University has published a book entitled "History of International Relations in the Far East," in which the part about American imperialism's aggression against China was written by Yefimov himself. He said: "Our task is very arduous. The Party requires us to continuously improve the ideological level of historical science. We must double our efforts to fulfill the Party's expectations for us."
    Our conversation lasted for two hours, but he still enthusiastically asked us what else we needed to know. Finally, he explained to us in a brisk tone such an important issue: Soviet historical science always educates the people and young people to promote national self-esteem, study the biographies of great figures, and continuously increase patriotic feelings; and strive to promote internationalist ideas and educate them to respect the struggle of the people of other countries to defend national independence and fight for democracy and peace. He said: "Comrade Stalin's recent speech at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the most obvious example of our carrying out internationalist education." At this point, he specially quoted two paragraphs from Comrade Stalin's speech to end his conversation. (Attached picture)

    苏联历史学界热心研究中国近代史
    ——访苏联历史学家叶菲莫夫教授
    沙英
    十一月五日下午，我们怀着异常兴奋的心情，访问了苏联文化工作者代表团团员、列宁格勒大学教授叶菲莫夫。
    叶菲莫夫是苏联列宁格勒大学远东历史系的系主任，他研究中国历史已有二十多年，著有“中国近代史”等书，是苏联著名的历史学家。他是参加十月初在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的苏联和平代表之一，现在他以苏联文化工作者代表团的一员参加我国“中苏友好月”活动。他不仅是一位卓越的学者，还是一位杰出的和平战士。
    因为我们要会见的是一位高贵的友人，所以在未见面之前，一种崇敬的心情，使我有点紧张。可是，他出现在我们的面前，亲切地跟我们握手，他的眼睛闪射出友爱的光芒，脸上挂着和蔼的微笑，特别是他那热情的话语，使我们中间语言的隔阂无形中完全消失了。我们感到十分轻松和温暖，就好像是坐在一个亲密的朋友的家里。
    当我们问到他关于苏联历史学界对于中国历史及东方历史的研究情况时，他经过片刻的沉思，就同我们倾谈起来。他谈得是那样的从容，在朴素的语句里夹杂着生动的事例；他有时反复地不厌其详地解释着，惟恐我们受语言的限制不能了解他的每一句话。他尽量想把苏联人民对中国人民的深厚友谊和热情关怀全部传达出来。
    “在苏联，最近二十七年以来，对于中国的历史感到极大的兴趣，特别是在伟大的中国人民革命胜利以后，在苏联研究中国历史已形成了一种高潮。”他接着说：因为苏联的青年学生和广大读者，都热烈地渴望着进一步了解中国的历史，特别是中国人民近数十年来英勇斗争的光辉事迹，苏联的历史学家认为尽力来帮助苏联人民满足这种愿望，乃是无上光荣的事情。在苏联很多大学和专门学校里，都设有研究中国历史及东方历史的机构，许多历史学家和研究工作人员，都在积极地钻研着，他们经常举行研究中国历史问题的学术讨论会，在报刊上发表过许多阐述中国历史问题的文章，也有很多人在从事翻译中国历史学家的著作。
    叶菲莫夫特别就他所熟知的莫斯科东方研究所和列宁格勒大学东方研究所的情况，向我们作了概括的介绍：莫斯科东方研究所有三个系——历史系、经济系和文学系，其中历史系主要的是研究中国历史，在文学系里研究中国文学也占着极重要的地位。在他们出版的“科学通报”上，常登载有关中国历史问题的文章。今年他们曾举行了两次学术讨论会，一次是讨论“中国的封建社会是什么时候形成的”，一次是讨论“太平天国失败的原因”。在每次讨论会上，发言都是很热烈的，他们对中国历史阶段的划分问题感到很大的兴趣，如在研究“中国封建社会是什么时候形成的”这一问题时，曾引起很热烈地争论。在列宁格勒大学东方研究所的教授、讲师和研究生们，现在着重研究中国近百年史，将来也要研究中国古代史。在他们的“历史问题”杂志及“列宁格勒大学通报”上，也登载着很多有关中国历史问题的论文。在一九五一年的冬天，他们热烈地讨论了“关于东方民族形成的问题”，大家都按照斯大林关于民族问题的科学定义，具体地分析了东方各民族的特殊的形成过程。叶菲莫夫特别强调地说：在研究这些问题时，毛泽东同志的著作，对于苏联历史学界研究中国历史及东方历史有极大的帮助。
    叶菲莫夫说：在苏联出版的关于中国历史方面的书籍，是一天一天地多起来了。历史学家杜门著的“美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌”一书及略特金所写的“英帝国主义对于中国的侵略”一文，对苏联读者有很大的影响。他说：他来中国之前，在苏联又出版了“东方国家新历史”两卷集，其中有重要的章节是阐述中国历史的。Г·Б·爱伦堡著的“中国人民解放斗争简史”一书，用简洁的文字介绍了中国人民的光荣斗争史，在苏联也很受读者的欢迎。他特别指出：“毛泽东选集”第一卷的译成俄文在苏联出版，对于研究中国历史的苏联历史学家们来说，那是一件大事，大家都以极其认真的态度来精心地研究它。苏联历史学界对中国进步的历史学家们的著作，也是十分重视的。例如郭沫若、陈伯达、范文澜、胡绳、刘大年等人的著作，在苏联都已有了翻译，华岗的“中国民族解放运动史”一书也正在翻译中。谈到这里，叶菲莫夫对中国历史学家们辛勤的劳动成果，表示了衷心地称赞。
    当记者请他谈一谈他自己研究中国历史的过程时，他极为热情地说：远在一九三二年，他就开始研究中国历史了，一九三五年在大学里讲授这门课程。他为了系统地深入地钻研中国历史，曾用了很大的精力来学习中文，以便能够直接阅读中国的书籍。从一九四○年开始，他便不断在苏联报刊上发表和出版有关中国历史问题的文章和著作。他曾在苏联各地的工厂、矿山、学校和部队中，作过许多次的关于中国历史方面的报告。一九四九年他出版了他的巨著“中国近代史”，一九五一年又出版了该书第二版。他说：“为了写作这本书，我曾阅读了马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林所有关于论及中国和殖民地半殖民地问题的经典著作，并尽可能搜集了毛泽东同志的著作来加以研究。一九四九年我得到一本大连出版的‘毛泽东选集’，如获至宝，实在对我有很大的教益。此外，我还尽量阅读了许多中国共产党的文件及其领导同志的言论，并广泛参考了中国进步历史学家们的著作。”从这里，我们可以知道他的写作态度是多么严肃，对于中国的历史是多么的热爱了。
    他这一次到中国来，曾在北京、上海、广州等地，访问了许多古迹，搜集了大批史料，并同许多中国历史学家交换过意见，他说这对他今后的研究工作有了极大的好处。他诚恳地说，这次到中国后，得到了许多新的认识，“因此回到苏联以后，第一个任务就是修改‘中国近代史’这本书，使它更充实更完满。”这充分表现了一个学者的极为可贵的谦虚态度和求实精神。
    叶菲莫夫对我们扼要地介绍了苏联历史学界近几年来的研究情况。他说：自从斯大林同志“马克思主义与语言学问题”及最近“苏联社会主义经济问题”的伟大著作发表以后，对苏联历史学界的推动作用是极大的。他们不仅要精心地研究斯大林同志这些著作，并且要遵照斯大林对于马克思列宁主义新的发展和贡献，来解决在苏联历史学家面前所提出的新任务。他强调地说：我们要在世界历史统一的整体下来分别地研究各国的特殊性，我们要根据科学的历史唯物主义的观点和方法创造性地去研究各国的历史。他同时强调：在苏联历史学界特别重视批评与自我批评的开展，这是推动历史研究工作不断前进的动力，绝不允许那种一团和气、互相奉承的自由主义作风的存在和发展。
    他还告诉我们：苏联历史学界，现在正以苏联科学院历史研究所的历史学者为中心，同时吸收全国各地的历史学家参加，准备编写“全世界通史”、“莫斯科的历史”、“列宁格勒的历史”等书，并要着重研究各国民族的形成及各国工人运动史、各国共产党的党史和各国经济发展史。列宁格勒大学的历史学者们，现在正从事研究国际关系史，该校东方研究所已出版了“远东国际关系史”一书，其中关于美帝国主义侵略中国的部分，就是叶菲莫夫自己执笔的。他说：“我们的任务是很艰巨的，党要求我们不断提高历史科学的思想水平，我们要加倍的努力，来完成党对于我们的期望。”
    我们谈话进行了两个钟头了，但他仍然热心地问我们还需要知道一些什么。最后，他又以爽朗的语调，对我们简明地说明了这样一个重要的问题：苏联历史科学总是教育人民和青年们要发扬民族的自尊心，研究伟大人物的传记，不断增长爱国主义的情感；并尽力宣扬国际主义的思想，教育他们尊重他国人民保卫民族独立、争取民主与和平的斗争。他说：“斯大林同志最近在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的演说，就是表现了我们进行国际主义教育最明显的例子。”至此，他特别引证了斯大林同志演说中的两段话结束了他的谈话。（附图片）
