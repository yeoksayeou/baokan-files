    Eisenhower's Deception of American Voters

    The quadrennial US presidential election has concluded. The result this time is that Wall Street has discarded the Democratic donkey it has ridden for the past twenty years and mounted the Republican elephant, which will swagger down the path to war. They will soon send Eisenhower to the White House.

    There is an old Chinese saying, "Those seeking rain go to the Dragon King Temple, those seeking children look for Guanyin." It is not difficult to imagine what Wall Street's purpose is in bringing out a war-monger who has played with guns for forty years and is covered in blood from implementing aggressive and war-preparatory policies in Western Europe, to be the US president.

    As early as January 1948, the American "National Council Against Conscription" published a report entitled "The Militarization of America," signed by well-known scientists, educators, and social workers. The report listed a very long list of names, pointing out that many important positions in the government had fallen into the hands of the military; the report cited facts to show that the US Department of the Army and the Navy were expanding their influence into the fields of education, science, and industry; and that American foreign policy was increasingly controlled by the military.

    This report appealed to the American people: "In the past, our most insistent and forceful condemnation of pre-war Japan was that the Japanese military controlled national policy through the government... Today, the same situation is already widespread in our own country. In Germany in those years, this trend... led to the rise of a militarized fascist regime... Therefore, every patriotic American should pay close attention to the current tendency of the military to control American life and organizations..."

    The faint voice of this report was drowned out by the mad war propaganda manufactured by American monopoly capitalists. Over the past four years, the pace of America's slide toward militarization has accelerated day by day. Now, they are simply handing over the presidential office to the military. Wall Street bosses have long regarded war and war preparations as a "life raft" to delay economic crises and maintain high profits. World War II brought them profits several times higher than in peacetime. The war of aggression against Korea had increased the profits of American monopoly capitalists twelve times in 1951 compared to the pre-war year of 1938. Where could they find a better deal than investing in war and armaments?

    Originally, the policy of expansion to the world pursued by the Democrat Truman over the years was not only the policy of the Democratic Party, but also the policy of the Republican Party. It is the common policy basis of the two-party US government. Wall Street was not very satisfied with Truman's government, because their pockets were stuffed full. However, the result of implementing this war policy accelerated the US towards the brink of disaster. At home, despite desperately expanding arms production, they could not delay the economic crisis, and many bourgeois economists were predicting the coming "economic depression"; the heavy taxes brought about by huge military expenditures and the sending of tens of thousands of people to be cannon fodder had long aroused resentment in every American family. Abroad, the US aggressive policy not only provoked resistance from the people of various countries, but also deepened the contradictions between the US and its satellite countries. The failure of the war of aggression against Korea exposed the greedy, brutal and outwardly strong but inwardly weak face of the US rulers to the world. In Dulles' words: "Looking back at American history, the United States has never been so unpopular abroad as it is now."

    This situation forced Wall Street to adopt the deceptive tactic of "rotation," and they found Eisenhower from the military camp to replace Truman.

    Eisenhower's selection by Wall Street was no accident. Early on, he proved himself to be a reliable pawn of Wall Street. During World War II, when Eisenhower served as "Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Western Europe," he carefully carried out Wall Street's instructions. Under his command, the air force almost destroyed every city and town in Germany, but those large-scale munitions factories and chemical companies in West Germany that had close ties with American monopoly capital were preserved intact, one after another. After the war, Eisenhower immediately worked hard to help Mobil Oil, General Electric, and General Motors, the few major American monopoly capital organizations, establish monopoly control in West Germany. Eisenhower's activities throughout the post-war period focused on expanding US military bases in Western Europe and urging the expansion of armaments in the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and thus served as the commander-in-chief of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. It was Eisenhower's criminal acts of threatening peaceful humanity that created the capital for him to be nominated as a presidential candidate by Wall Street.

    After Eisenhower participated in the election this year, major monopoly capital groups such as Rockefeller, DuPont, Morgan, Mellon, and Ford actively supported him from the beginning. Rockefeller Group's Chase Bank Chairman Aldrich ran to Chicago to help Eisenhower preside over the Republican presidential candidate nomination campaign; Ford Group's head Henry Ford also personally came out to campaign. They used money, official positions, women, and other temptations and threats to get most of the small Republican henchmen to vote for Eisenhower. According to the New York "Daily Mirror," Eisenhower spent $20 million in campaign funds to win the Republican presidential nomination this time. Wall Street certainly did not skimp on the capital!

    The US presidential election has always been a fraud of the so-called two-party politics manipulated by Wall Street bosses, but this time the US presidential election fraud is even more shameless.

    Eisenhower was able to snatch the US presidency this time, and his promise to end the Korean War played a significant role. This ambiguous promise enabled him to deceive a majority of voters.

    However, this cannot conceal Eisenhower's war ambitions in the slightest. His war ambitions were originally very blatant. On July 11, just after he grabbed the Republican presidential nomination, he publicly declared that he would lead a new "crusade." He told the lackeys of the Republican National Convention:

    "You... summon me to engage in a great crusade to defend freedom within the United States and freedom throughout the world (should be read as suppressing the people at home and invading the world). I have some understanding of the sacred duty of leading a crusade. I have led a crusade. Therefore, I undertake this task with diligence and dedication... I accept your call. I will lead this crusade."

    On August 24, in his speech in New York, he publicly declared that he planned to build an army to attack the Soviet Union. He said that this army "should have such a positive effect that its powerful offensive potential is enough to create terrible nightmares for the Kremlin..." (Associated Press, New York, August 25).

    On August 25, his speech at the National Convention of the American Legion in New York was even more unabashed in announcing his crazy dreams. He included Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania from the Soviet Union, and various people's democratic countries in Eastern Europe, all the way to China, Mongolia, and other countries, into the "American blood relative" system. He claimed that the United States would use force to "recapture" these places.

    This speech, imitating Hitler's tone, nakedly exposed Wall Street's aggressive ambitions, which resulted in panic among American voters and "bewilderment" among America's satellite countries. The British "Daily Mirror" commented: Can Eisenhower "this strategy win votes? Or will it backfire on him? We have yet to see, because it has frightened moderate public opinion." This had put Eisenhower's campaign in a very unfavorable position for a time.

    The seemingly invincible war-monger of the United States was forced to admit a most basic fact: the ordinary people of the United States and Western Europe all want peace, first of all to achieve peace in Korea. Eisenhower, who had been guaranteeing war to the big capitalists for a long time, had to suddenly put away his war cries on the eve of the real election, and drastically guaranteed "peace" to ordinary voters. At the beginning of September, this general, who had been talking about building "attack" armies a few days ago, suddenly proposed a "Ten-Point Peace Plan." In this "plan," there was talk of "the United States should concentrate its efforts on seeking lasting peace and disarmament," "the United States must use all other methods to prevent war," "use various peaceful methods, and only use peaceful methods, to safeguard the rights of freedom"... Truly putting on a full "peace" posture. Immediately afterwards, according to the Associated Press Boston dispatch on October 3, Eisenhower "made a guarantee that if he were elected president, he would devote himself to a supreme goal - striving for world peace," and he "reaffirmed that if elected, he intends to go to Korea and try to end the war on the spot."

    Such an ambiguous promise was actually described by the "Washington Daily News" as "having won unanimous praise from the country." This is because the US military has lost 290,000 people in the Korean War, and more than one million American youth have been sent to this war to be tortured and are being sent to their deaths. The US Department of the Army announced that the US will soon recruit ten million young people into the army (October 18, United Press). War threatens every family in the United States. The "Washington Star" wrote on October 18: "All women hate wars in Korea or elsewhere, and many mothers will seize any promise to oppose sending their sons into war." This is why Eisenhower's ambiguous "promise" was able to deceive votes.

    However, this kind of deception in elections in capitalist countries is simply commonplace. Everyone remembers that on the eve of the 1948 US election, when the Berlin issue was tense, the American people were eager to improve relations between the US and the Soviet Union, and Truman announced on October 5 of that year that he intended to send Vincent to Moscow for negotiations, deceiving many votes. But after the votes were in hand, Truman announced on November 16: "There is no intention to send any representatives to Moscow for negotiations." In last year's British election, Churchill also played the same trick. Eight days before the election (October 17), Churchill announced that he would propose an idea for the leaders of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to hold a new negotiation, and said: "This idea requires me to do my best to build a bridge over the abyss between the two worlds." However, after Churchill came to power, in answering the question of Labour MP Lewis, he changed his tone and said: "I think the opportunity to hold talks may have been lost."

    Therefore, even the British "Times" believes that Eisenhower's hastily produced promise can only deceive those "less sophisticated voters" - there are quite a few of these voters in the United States. According to a survey by American bourgeois social survey expert Gallup, despite the unprecedented waste of the Republican and Democratic parties in the election campaign, three out of every four Americans still do not know who the vice-presidential candidates of the two parties are. - As for more clear-minded people, they are skeptical of it. A reporter for the "New York World-Telegram and Sun" interviewed a 26-year-old clerk, who believed that "everyone is lying" in the election; another veteran said: "There are too many despicable and dirty things in this election campaign." Progressive Party presidential candidate Hallinan said: Eisenhower's promise is only a "crowd-pleasing statement" and "cannot give much comfort to Americans who hope to end the Korean War."

    But Eisenhower's trick is about to be exposed. All American parents who have sons fighting in Korea, especially the hundreds of thousands of American soldiers on the Korean battlefield, are anxiously waiting for the end of the Korean War. In a dispatch from Seoul on the 5th of this month, Associated Press reporter described that Corporal Liedorf, who had been in Korea for twelve months, said on behalf of all American soldiers: "When Ike comes to Korea, I hope he will invite us all back to the United States." Corporal Anthony also said: "I hope whoever is elected can get me home sooner." Corporal George Waldken also said: "The person who is elected must let American soldiers leave this country in order to prove that he is competent." For these ordinary Americans, Eisenhower must immediately prove that he is not the most despicable and shameless liar. But unless the US ruling group changes its policy on the Korean negotiations, that is, abandons its absurd claim of forcibly detaining prisoners of war, Eisenhower has no way to make such a proof. Precisely because of his deception, Eisenhower will fall into a place deeper than the mud pit that Truman had already fallen into on his last day as soon as he comes to power. Whether Eisenhower continues to maintain the current US war policy toward Korea, or takes further risks, will not scare the heroic, tenacious, united, and vigilant people of China and Korea, but will only punish himself. A British newspaper, the London Star, put it well: "So far we have not seen anyone hit themselves with a big stick, but Eisenhower's big stick may hit his own face."

    艾森豪威尔对于美国选民的欺骗
    四年一度的美国总统竞选揭晓了。这一次选举的结果是：华尔街扔掉了它二十年来所驾驭的民主党老驴，跨上了那匹将要在战争道路上大摇大摆的共和党大象。他们很快就要把艾森豪威尔送进白宫去了。
    中国民间有一句古话：“求雨的进龙王庙，求子的找观世音。”华尔街把一个玩了四十年枪杆并因在西欧执行侵略和备战政策而满身血腥气的战争贩子捧出来当美国总统，目的何在是不难想像的。
    早在一九四八年一月，美国“全国反兵役协会”曾发表一份题名为“美国的军事化”的报告书，署名的都是知名的科学家、教育家和社会工作者。报告书里开列了一张极长的名单，指出政府中许多重要职位都已落在军人手里；报告书列举事实，说明美国陆军部和海军部都在向教育界、科学界、实业界扩展他们的势力；美国的外交政策也在日甚一日地受军方的控制。
    这个报告书向美国人民呼吁道：“过去我们对于战前的日本的最坚持的最有力的谴责，就是说日本军部通过政府而控制着……国策。今日我们自己的国家里早已普遍地存在着同样的情形。在当年的德国，也是这一种倾向，……造成了军事化法西斯政权的兴起。……因此，对于目前军人控制美国人生活和组织的倾向，每个爱国的美国人应该予以深切的注意。……”
    这个报告书发出的微弱呼声，被美国垄断资本家们所制造的疯狂的战争宣传淹没掉了。四年来，美国走向军事化的步子一天一天加紧。现在，索性把总统的职务也交给军人了。华尔街老板们早就把战争和备战当作他们延缓经济危机、维持高额利润的“救生圈”。第二次世界大战给他们带来了高出和平时期数倍的利润。而侵略朝鲜的战争又曾使美国的垄断资本家们的利润在一九五一年比战前的一九三八年多十二倍。那儿能找到比向战争和军火投资更好的买卖呢？
    本来，民主党的杜鲁门这些年来所遵行的向全世界扩张的政策，不仅是民主党的政策，也是共和党的政策。它是美国两党政府共同的政策基础。对于杜鲁门的政府，华尔街未尝不是很满意的，因为他们的荷包是塞得满满的了。可是，这种战争政策执行的结果，却把美国加速推进到灾难的边缘。在国内，尽管拚命扩充军火生产也延缓不了经济危机了，许多资产阶级的经济学家也在预言即将来到的“经济萧条”；浩大的军费所带来的重税和成千成万人被送去当炮灰，早已引起了美国人民每个家庭的怨懑。在国外，美国的侵略政策不仅招致了各国人民的反抗，而且加深了美国和各仆从国家之间的矛盾。侵朝战争的失败，使美国统治者的贪馋、暴虐和外强中干的脸孔在全世界暴露无遗。用杜勒斯的话来说：“打开美国历史看，美国在国外从来没有像现在这样不得人心。”
    这种形势使华尔街不得不采取了“轮换”的欺骗手法，他们从军营里找到了艾森豪威尔来代替杜鲁门。
    艾森豪威尔被华尔街看中不是偶然的。很早以来，他就证明了自己是华尔街可靠的走卒。第二次世界大战期间，艾森豪威尔担任“西欧盟军总司令”时，就小心翼翼地执行了华尔街的指示。在他的指挥下的空军，几乎破坏了德国的每一个城市和村镇，可是西德那些和美国垄断资本有密切关系的规模巨大的军火工厂和化学公司，却一座一座完整无损地被保存下来了。大战结束以后，艾森豪威尔又马上努力协助美孚油公司、通用电气公司和通用汽车公司等这几个主要的美国垄断资本组织在西德建立垄断控制。艾森豪威尔在整个战后时期的活动，集中于在西欧扩张美国的军事基地和督促北大西洋集团各国扩张军备，并因此而担任了北大西洋侵略集团的总司令。正是艾森豪威尔的这些威胁和平人类的罪恶行为，造成了他被华尔街提名为总统候选人的资本。
    今年艾森豪威尔参加竞选以后，洛克斐勒、杜邦、摩根、梅隆、福特等主要垄断资本集团，一开始就积极支持他。洛克斐勒集团的大通银行董事长阿德利治跑到芝加哥帮艾森豪威尔主持共和党的总统候选人提名竞选；福特集团的当家人亨利·福特也亲自出马活动。他们用金钱、官职、女色和其他种种诱惑、威胁办法，使共和党的大部分小党棍投了艾森豪威尔的票。据纽约“每日镜报”说，艾森豪威尔这次赢得共和党总统候选人的提名，花了两千万美元活动费。华尔街的确没有吝惜本钱！
    美国的总统选举，从来是华尔街老板操纵下的所谓两党政治的骗局，而这一次美国总统选举的骗局却更加无耻。
    艾森豪威尔这回能够抢到美国总统，他的结束朝鲜战争的诺言起了很不小的作用。这个语意含混的诺言使他能够骗取了多数的选票。
    但是，这丝毫不能掩盖艾森豪威尔的战争野心。他的战争野心本来是十分露骨的。七月十一日，在他刚刚抢到了共和党总统候选人资格之后，就公然声称他要领导新的“十字军”。他对共和党全国代表大会的喽囉们说：
    “你们……召唤我从事一个保卫美国国内的自由和全世界的自由（应读作镇压国内人民和侵略全世界）的伟大十字军。我对于领导一个十字军的神圣职责，是有一些了解的。我已经领导过一个十字军。因此我是以兢兢业业的精神承当这个任务的。……我接受你们的召唤。我要领导这个十字军。”
    八月二十四日，他在纽约演说时，公然宣称要计划建立进攻苏联的军队。他说这个军队“应该有这样的积极作用，就是：它们的强大的进击潜力足以使克里姆林产生可怕的恶梦……”（美联社纽约八月二十五日电）。
    八月二十五日，他在纽约美国退伍军人团全国代表大会上的演说，更是毫无忌惮地宣布了他的疯狂梦想。他把从苏联的爱沙尼亚、拉特维亚、立陶宛和东欧各人民民主国家，一直到中国、蒙古等国，都列入“美国的血亲”系统内。他声称美国要以武力“夺回”这些地方。
    这篇仿效希特勒口吻的演说，赤裸裸地暴露了华尔街的侵略野心，结果引起了美国选民的恐慌，而且使美国的仆从国家“震骇莫名”。英国“每日镜报”评论道：艾森豪威尔“这种策略究竟能赢得选票呢？还是会反害他自己？还待看下文，因为这吓坏了温和的舆论。”这曾使艾森豪威尔的竞选一度处于十分不利的地位。
    美国的似乎不可一世的战争贩子被迫承认一个最基本的事实：美国和西欧的普通老百姓都要求和平，首先是实现朝鲜的和平。在长期间向大资本家保证战争的艾森豪威尔到了真正的选举前夕不能不突然收起他的战争叫嚣，急转直下地向普通选民保证“和平”。九月初旬这位几天前还在高谈建立“进击”军队的将军，忽然提出一个“十点和平计划”来了。在这个“计划”里面，满纸是什么“美国应该集中力量谋求持久和平和裁减军备”呀，“美国必须利用一切其他方法来防止战争”呀，“用各种和平方法，也只得用和平方法来维护自由的权利”呀……真是装出了十足的“和平”姿势。紧接着，按照美联社波士顿十月三日电讯，艾森豪威尔“提出保证说，如果他当选总统，将献身于一个最高目标——争取世界和平”，并且他“再度声明，他如当选，他打算前往朝鲜，努力就地终止战争。”
    这么一句语意含混的诺言，竟然被“华盛顿每日新闻”说成“已经获得全国一致的好评”的了。这是因为美国军队在朝鲜战争中损失了二十九万人，前后被送到这个战争中折磨过和正在送死的美国青年已有一百多万。美国陆军部宣布，不久的将来美国将征一千万青年入伍（十月十八日合众社电）。战争威胁着美国人民的每一个家庭。“华盛顿明星报”在十月十八日写道：“所有的女人都痛恨在朝鲜或其他地方的战争，许多母亲都要抓住任何一种诺言而反对把她们的儿子们投入战争。”这就是艾森豪威尔的这句含混的“诺言”所以能够骗取选票的缘故。
    然而，资本主义国家选举中的这种欺骗花样简直是家常便饭。大家记得，一九四八年美国大选前夕，那时正是柏林问题紧张的时候，美国人民都渴望改善美、苏两国的关系，杜鲁门在那一年的十月五日宣布打算派文生赴莫斯科谈判，骗到了不少选票。可是选票到了手之后，杜鲁门在十一月十六日又宣布：“无意派遣任何代表赴莫斯科谈判”了。去年英国大选中，邱吉尔也玩了同样的花样。大选投票前八天（十月十七日），邱吉尔宣布：他要提出一个英、美、苏的领袖举行一次新谈判的意见，并且说：“这个意见要求我尽最大的努力在两个世界之间的深渊上建造一座桥梁。”但是，邱吉尔上台以后，在答复工党议员路易斯的质问时，他又变了腔调说：“我认为举行会谈的时机可能已经失去”了。
    所以，艾森豪威尔临时加工赶制的诺言，连英国“泰晤士报”也认为它只能欺骗那些“世故比较浅的选民”——这种选民在美国的数量是不少的，据美国一位资产阶级社会调查专家盖洛晋的调查，尽管美国的共和党民主党在竞选运动中作了空前的糜费，每四个美国人当中，仍然有三个人连两党的副总统候选人是谁都不知道。——至于比较明白的人，就对它抱怀疑态度。“纽约世界电讯太阳报”记者访问了一个二十六岁的店员，这店员就认为大选中“每一个人都在撒谎”；另一个退伍军人说：“这次竞选活动里面，卑鄙肮脏的事情太多了。”进步党的总统候选人哈利南说：艾森豪威尔的诺言只是一个“笼络群众的声明”，“并不能使希望结束朝鲜战争的美国人感到多少安慰。”
    但是艾森豪威尔的骗局是马上要拆穿的。所有有儿子在朝鲜作战的美国父母，特别是朝鲜战场上几十万美国兵，都在迫切地等待着朝鲜战争的结束。美联社记者本月五日从汉城发出的电讯中描述，已在朝鲜十二个月的上等兵利道夫代表所有的美国兵说：“当艾克来朝鲜时，我希望他能邀请我们都回美国去。”上等兵安吞尼也说：“我希望无论谁当选都能使我早些回家。”上等兵乔治·华德肯也说：“当选的人要让美国兵离开这个国家，以便证明他是能胜任的。”对于这些美国普通人，艾森豪威尔必须马上证明自己不是最卑鄙无耻的骗子。但是除非美国统治集团改变对朝鲜谈判的政策，即抛弃其强迫扣留战俘的荒谬主张，艾森豪威尔是没有任何办法来作这种证明的。正是由于他的欺骗，艾森豪威尔一上台就要跌到比杜鲁门末日所已经陷进的泥坑最深处更深的地方。无论艾森豪威尔继续保持目前美国对朝鲜的战争政策，或是进行进一步的冒险，都吓不倒英勇坚毅团结一致和富于警惕性的朝中人民，而只会惩罚他自己。一家英国报纸伦敦明星报说得对：“至今我们还没有看到拿大棍打自己的人，但艾森豪威尔的大棍可能打到他自己的脸上。”
