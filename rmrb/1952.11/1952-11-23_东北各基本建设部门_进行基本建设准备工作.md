    Northeast Basic Construction Departments
    Conduct Basic Construction Preparation Work
    [This newspaper reports] The basic construction departments in Northeast China are working intensely to prepare for basic construction in 1953.
    Experience in Northeast China over the past few years has proven that correctly and promptly proposing engineering plans is one of the important prerequisites for ensuring the smooth progress of basic construction work. Therefore, the basic construction planning departments in Northeast China began carefully reviewing the major engineering projects for 1953 as early as September and October this year, and initially summarized the experience of past planning to improve this year's planning work. The Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government also gathered a large number of engineering and technical personnel to compile engineering budget quotas based on practical experience. Using these quotas to prepare annual plans can save a large amount of manpower, materials, and time. This is a major reform in basic construction planning. Many provincial and municipal basic construction departments have also begun preparing next year's plans. Provinces and cities that started earlier are expected to finish by the end of November. In the process of preparing the plans, all units have learned from past experiences and lessons, concentrated investments on major engineering projects, and conducted in-depth investigation and research, which will help avoid many detours in next year's basic construction work.
    In order to accelerate the progress of basic construction, standard designs will be widely promoted in basic construction work in the Northeast region next year, in order to reduce design time, improve the technical level of designers, and ensure design quality; at the same time, with the production conditions for a large number of similar buildings, it will also be possible to organize industrialized construction. This will not only reverse the situation where design lags behind construction, but also solve the difficulty of insufficient design personnel. According to statistics, if the old method of decentralized design is used, the civil engineering design personnel of the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government system can only undertake 40% of the department's civil engineering design tasks; but with the implementation of standard design, they can undertake all design tasks. At the same time, in carrying out design work, design work quotas are also seriously stipulated, design work plans are formulated, the responsibility system for design personnel is strengthened, and the review system is strictly enforced, so that design efficiency can be further improved.
    Mechanized construction in basic construction in the Northeast region will also be greatly developed next year. The Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government has begun ordering mechanized construction equipment, and has tentatively decided to carry out large-scale mechanized and industrialized construction on six key projects such as the Northeast Institute of Technology construction site next year. The degree of mechanization will reach 60% of the total workload, and heavy labor such as excavation, hoisting, transportation, and concrete mixing will be replaced by machinery. Due to the promotion of standard design, a large number of building components such as doors and windows, stairs, roof frames, and reinforced concrete floor slabs will be centrally manufactured in factories and distributed to various sites for installation. This will greatly accelerate the progress of construction and installation projects, improve project quality and reduce project costs. Many provincial and municipal construction and installation enterprises will also gradually transition from completely manual production methods to mechanized construction. The state has invested more than 130 billion yuan for this purpose this year, and various engineering companies are planning to establish affiliated enterprises (carpentry factories, reinforced concrete factories, etc.) and purchase mechanized construction equipment.
    In order to ensure the progress of next year's projects, the preparation of manpower and materials is a very important task. The Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government and various provinces and cities are continuing to transfer personnel to enrich basic construction organizations. For example, in order to strengthen design work, many bureaus and companies of the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government have enriched design organizations and organized leading cadres and technical personnel of design departments to go deep into construction sites to understand the advantages and disadvantages of this year's design work, as the basis for improving next year's design work. The various engineering companies under the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government will also enrich cadres, rectify organizations, and strengthen the organizations of the Party, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League this winter. In the past, the basic construction departments of various provinces and cities, except for Dalian, did not have centralized independent design organizations, and design was done concurrently by the construction technicians of the engineering companies. Therefore, it was impossible to concentrate technical forces, resulting in low work efficiency and difficulty in improving quality. At present, the people's governments of various provinces and cities have concentrated local design forces. There are now nine professional provincial and municipal design organizations in the entire Northeast, which can basically undertake the basic construction design tasks of various provinces and cities. Next year, various provinces and cities in the Northeast will also universally establish construction engineering bureaus to specifically lead the construction organizations and design organizations in various provinces and cities. In the past, various provinces and cities had a total of 67 large and small construction and installation enterprises, with decentralized leadership and unconcentrated technical forces. In order to overcome this weakness, local governments have initially concentrated these construction and installation enterprises into 28 relatively large construction and installation enterprises.
    At the same time, various regions and engineering companies in the Northeast have actively carried out the work of fixing workers. The task of fixing 25,000 construction workers in the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government system has been basically completed. By late October, various provinces and cities had also fixed more than 22,000 people, accounting for 55% of the original plan. In order to solve the housing problem for these workers, various places have begun to build a large number of employee dormitories, with more than 90,000 square meters built by various provinces and cities alone. Many units (such as Shenyang Engineering Company, etc.) have also built some necessary cultural and welfare facilities around the employee dormitories. This winter, large-scale training will be conducted for these fixed workers, cadres, and technical personnel, to provide them with systematic political and technical education. At present, many regions and engineering companies have formulated training plans. Songjiang Province has specially established a "Basic Construction Workers Winter Training Committee" to train about 10,000 fixed workers, and to conduct general short-term rotational training for site-level cadres and technical personnel, so that they can improve ideologically and professionally. While fixing workers, all units have carefully promoted a large number of cadres with both ability and integrity. The First Engineering Company of the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government alone has promoted 300 site directors and 1,000 construction workers from among the workers. These newly promoted cadres will be a strong new force on the basic construction front next year.
    The preparation and storage of building materials are also being carried out intensely. By the end of the year, the entire Northeast can store more than 800 million bricks, which can guarantee the supply of bricks for the entire Northeast in the first and second quarters of next year. Some of the main building materials such as cement and wood have been pre-allocated to various construction units and are being actively organized for processing. The supply of hardware and equipment (plumbing and electrical materials) in the Northeast region has been difficult this year, and many units have been unable to carry out indoor work smoothly because they could not buy the required equipment. Therefore, the people's governments of various provinces and cities in the Northeast region are actively organizing state-owned enterprises and private enterprises to process them to ensure that the construction period will not be affected by insufficient supply next year.
    Summarizing the experience and lessons learned in past basic construction work is also an extremely important task for doing a good job in basic construction. Many engineering companies in the Northeast have begun to summarize this year's experience and lessons in project management, improved technology, improved tools, improved labor organization, financial management, political work, and security work. In order to promote the advanced experience summarized by various units, the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government and the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions will jointly convene a basic construction advanced producers conference at the end of November, so that cadres, workers, and technical personnel of various engineering units can learn and master several major advanced experiences related to construction management, technology, and political work more quickly.
    However, it should be pointed out that some leading cadres in Northeast China still do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of basic construction preparation work, emphasizing objective difficulties and the tight schedule of this year's tasks, and have not yet grasped this work. Although some units have taken action, they do not know what to do first. Therefore, the leading cadres of these units must fully recognize the importance of basic construction preparation work, act quickly, grasp the key points of work, and actively carry out preparation work in order to meet the arduous task of basic construction in the Northeast next year.

    东北各基本建设部门
    进行基本建设准备工作
    【本报讯】东北各基本建设部门，正在紧张地进行一九五三年基本建设的准备工作。
    东北几年来的经验证明，正确而及时地提出工程计划，是保证基本建设工作顺利进行的重要前提之一。因此，东北各基本建设计划部门早在今年九、十两月份即开始详细审核一九五三年的主要工程项目，初步总结过去编制计划的经验，以改进今年的计划工作。东北人民政府工业部并集中了大批工程技术人员，根据实际经验，编制了工程概算定额。根据这种定额编制年计划，可以节省大批人力、物力和时间。这是基本建设计划工作中一项重大的改革。许多省、市基本建设部门也已开始明年计划的编制工作。开始较早的省、市，可望于十一月底结束。在编制计划中，各单位都接受了过去的经验教训，集中使用投资于主要工程项目，并深入进行调查研究工作，这将使明年基本建设工作少走很多弯路。
    为了加速基本建设的进行，明年东北地区的基本建设工作中，将普遍推广标准设计，以便减少设计时间，提高设计人员的技术水平，保证设计质量；同时有了大量同类建筑物的生产条件，也就可以组织工厂化施工。这样，不仅可以扭转设计落后于施工的局面，而且可以解决设计人员不足的困难。据统计，按旧的分散设计的方法设计，东北人民政府工业部系统的土木建筑设计人员，只能负起该部土木建筑工程设计任务的百分之四十；但推行标准设计，就可负起全部设计任务了。同时，在进行设计工作时，还认真地规定设计工作定额，制订设计工作计划，加强设计人员责任制，严格审核制度，这样，就能进一步提高设计效率。
    东北区明年基本建设中的机械化施工也将有很大发展。东北人民政府工业部已着手机械化施工设备订货，并初步决定明年在东北工学院工地等六个重点工程上展开大规模的机械化、工厂化施工。其机械化程度要达到全部工作量的百分之六十，诸如挖土、起重、运输、混凝土搅拌等繁重劳动，都将用机械代替。由于标准设计的推行，大量建筑物部件如门窗、楼梯、房架、钢筋混凝土楼板等，都将在工厂中集中制造，分送各现场安装。这将大大加速建筑安装工程的进度，提高工程质量和降低工程成本。许多省、市建筑安装企业，也将由完全手工业生产方式逐渐过渡到机械化施工。今年国家已为此投下了一千三百余亿元的资金，各工程公司正在筹划建立附属企业（木工工厂、钢筋混凝土工厂等）和购置机械化施工设备。
    为了保证明年工程的进行，人力和物力的准备工作，是十分重要的一项工作。东北人民政府工业部和各省、市，正继续抽调人员，充实基本建设机构。例如，为了加强设计工作，东北人民政府工业部许多管理局和公司都充实了设计机构，并组织设计部门的领导干部和技术人员深入施工现场，从中了解今年设计工作的优点和缺点，作为改进明年设计工作的依据。东北人民政府工业部所属各工程公司也将在今冬充实干部，整顿机构，壮大党、工会、青年团的组织，东北各省、市的基本建设部门，过去除旅大市外，没有集中的独立的设计机构，都由工程公司的施工技术人员兼作设计，因之便不能集中技术力量，以至工作效率低，质量也不易提高。目前各省、市人民政府都集中了当地的设计力量。现全东北共有九个专业性的省、市设计机构，基本上可以担负起各省、市的基本建设设计任务。东北各省、市在明年还将普遍成立建筑工程局，专门领导各省、市的施工机构及设计组织。各省、市过去共有大小建筑安装企业六十七个，领导力量分散，技术力量也不集中。为克服这一弱点，各地方政府已将这些建筑安装企业初步分别集中成二十八个比较大的建筑安装企业。
    同时，东北各地区和各工程公司都积极进行了固定工人的工作。东北人民政府工业部系统固定两万五千名建筑工人的任务已基本完成。各省、市到十月下旬，也已固定了两万二千余人，占原订计划的百分之五十五。为解决这些工人的住宿问题，各地都开始大量兴建职工宿舍，仅各省、市已建筑的就有九万多平方米。许多单位（如沈阳市工程公司等）还在职工宿舍周围修建了一部分必要的文化、福利设施。对这些已固定的工人和干部、技术人员，今冬将进行大规模的训练，向他们进行系统的政治和技术教育。目前许多地区和工程公司已订出训练计划。松江省并为此专门成立了“基本建设工人冬季训练委员会”，训练固定工人约一万人，并对工地一级干部及技术人员进行普遍的短期轮训，使能从思想上业务上提高一步。在固定工人的同时，各单位都慎重地提拔了大批德才兼备的干部。仅东北人民政府工业部第一工程公司，就由工人中提拔了三百名工地主任，一千名施工员。这些新提拔的干部，将是明年基本建设战线上坚强的生力军。
    建筑材料的准备与储备工作也在紧张进行中。到年底，全东北可储备红砖八亿块以上，可以保证明年第一、二两季全东北用砖的供应。水泥、木材等主要建筑材料，有一部分已经预拨至各建设单位，正在积极组织加工。东北区五金器材（水暖、电气材料）的供应，今年曾发生困难，许多单位因买不到所需器材使室内工作不能顺利进行。因此，东北区各省、市人民政府正积极组织国营企业和私营企业加工，保证明年不再因供应不济而影响工期。
    总结过去基本建设工作中的经验和教训，也是做好基本建设极为重要的工作。东北许多工程公司已着手总结今年在工程管理、改进技术、改进工具、改善劳动组织、财务管理、政治工作和保安工作等方面的经验教训。为了把各单位总结出的先进经验推广开去，东北人民政府工业部与东北总工会将于十一月底联合召开基本建设先进生产者大会，以便使各工程单位的干部、工人、技术人员更快地学会并掌握几种主要的有关施工管理、技术和政治工作方面的先进经验。
    但应该指出，目前东北有些单位的领导干部对基本建设准备工作的重要性尚认识不足，强调客观困难和今年任务太紧，尚未抓紧这一工作。有些单位虽然动起来了，却不知先搞什么。因此，这些单位的领导干部，必须充分认识到基本建设准备工作的重要性，迅速行动起来，抓住工作重点，积极进行准备工作，以便迎接明年东北基本建设的繁重的任务。
