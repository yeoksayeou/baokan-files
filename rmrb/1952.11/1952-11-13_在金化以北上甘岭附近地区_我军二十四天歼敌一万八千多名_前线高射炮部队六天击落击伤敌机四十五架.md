Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 12th: Fierce battles continue to rage on two hills near Shangganling, north of Jinhua. Since our army completely controlled the right side of Shangganling on November 2nd, the enemy has attacked this hill with forces ranging from a platoon to two battalions on the 3rd, all of which were repelled by our army. There was no fighting on the 4th; the enemy took a full day to regroup, and only launched another offensive on the 5th. The battle on this day began at dawn, with the enemy using eight companies to attack six positions on the right side of Shangganling, fighting fiercely until noon, but were all repelled by our army. In the afternoon, the enemy reinforced with another two battalions, flanking around the back of the main peak to attack, launching four consecutive fierce attacks within fifteen minutes, but all failed, and they had to retreat hastily down the mountain. In this day's battle, our army annihilated more than 1,700 enemy troops. On the left side of Shangganling, the enemy and we repeatedly fought for the main peak position for days. This place changed hands four times, and was once again occupied by our army on the 5th. The enemy suffered equally heavy casualties on this hill. From October 14th to November 6th, in the twenty-four days, our army has annihilated more than 18,000 enemy troops on the two hills near Shangganling.

From November 1st to 6th, our army captured ten enemy positions in the areas northeast of Tieyuan, northwest of Jinhua, west of Jincheng, and southwest of Changchengli, annihilating more than 600 enemy troops. Our frontline anti-aircraft artillery units shot down eight enemy aircraft and damaged thirty-seven enemy aircraft.

    我军二十四天歼敌一万八千多名
    前线高射炮部队六天击落击伤敌机四十五架
    【新华社朝鲜前线十二日电】在金化以北上甘岭附近两座山岭上继续发生着激烈的争夺战。自十一月二日我军完全控制了上甘岭右侧山岭以后，三日敌人接连用一个排到两个营的兵力攻击这座山岭，都被我军击退。四日没有发生战斗，敌人喘息了整整一天，到五日才再度发起进攻。这一天的战斗是在天亮时开始的，敌人用八个连的兵力分头向上甘岭右侧山岭的六个阵地进攻，一直激战到正午，都被我军击退。下午敌人又增兵两个营，绕到主峰背后进行攻击，在十五分钟内连续猛攻四次，但也都遭到失败，最后只好匆忙地退下山去。在这一天作战中，我军共计歼灭敌军一千七百多名。在上甘岭左侧的山岭上，敌我连日反复争夺主峰阵地。这个地方曾四度易手，到五日又为我军再度攻占。敌人在这个山岭上同样遭到了重大的伤亡。自十月十四日到十一月六日的二十四天中，我军已在上甘岭附近两座山岭上歼敌一万八千多人。
    在十一月一日到六日，我军在铁原东北、金化西北、金城以西、长承里西南等地区攻占十处敌军阵地，歼敌六百多名。我军前线高射炮部队击落敌机八架，击伤敌机三十七架。
