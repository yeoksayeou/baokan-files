I Saw Highly Infectious Dance Art
Ouyang Yuqian

The preciousness of artistic sensibility lies in its profound ability to move people. After watching the performances of Soviet dance artists Galina Ulanova and Tamara Khanum, the infectious power was so strong that it was unbelievable, as if every nerve and every cell had been permeated. It was joy, it was pleasure, it was beauty. I don't know how to put it. I can only say that I truly felt the power of art.

Ulanova is a People's Artist of the entire Soviet Union, and her performance is the highest expression of dance art. When she performs, every element—movement, expression, line, music, rhythm, and rhyme—is unified with her thoughts and feelings. The melody and rhythm of the music are completely integrated with her expression and movements, becoming a coherent, harmonious whole. She has mastered a high level of technique, so it is difficult to see traces of her using technique, which is extraordinarily rare and valuable. Our Chinese dancer Dai Ailian said, "Ulanova's dance surpasses Greek sculpture." I agree with her. Greek sculpture is the work of outstanding ancient artists. Ulanova is a People's Artist of the Soviet Socialist Republics today. It is not surprising that her creations surpass ancient Greek art.

I saw her perform "Swan Lake" in Moscow and saw her perform "Romeo and Juliet" in a movie, and I had the above feelings long ago. This time, she only performed fragments of classical dance and some short pieces in Beijing. It is difficult for us to have a comprehensive understanding of her art, but even this is enough to amaze people. We heard that one audience member who had never seen a Soviet ballet said, "She is truly like an immortal!" I think this feeling is universal.

She is not only a People's Artist of the Soviet Union, but also an artist with worldwide reputation, loved by the working people. Last year, when she went to Italy, many people flew from France and England to see her performances. Some reactionaries wanted to ban her performances, but the Italian people rose up to oppose them, and the performances were successfully staged.

On the 13th, she came to the Central Academy of Drama. We performed several programs to entertain her, one of which was an excerpt from the opera "The Young Guard"—a passage sung by Oleg's mother, sung in Russian. She praised the soloist's technique and musical cultivation. In addition, one comrade said that the Russian pronunciation was not correct enough, but she said that the problem was not whether the Russian pronunciation was correct, but that the singer had not been able to fully grasp the character's thoughts and feelings. When Oleg's mother's son was arrested, she was not only sad, but also resistant. Our singer did not sing strongly enough and did not express a spirit of struggle, so she did not resemble a Russian mother. This kind of pointing out is very correct, necessary, and kind. This makes us more deeply aware of how important ideology is to a work of art. Like our impressions of other Soviet comrades, our impression of Comrade Ulanova is not only of her superb artistic creation, but also of her deep friendship that deeply moved us.

As for Comrade Tamara Khanum, we seem to have met her more often in movies than Ulanova, so seeing her felt like seeing a close friend. We did not feel unfamiliar with her Cotton Picking Dance and several other dances. She is a very bold and militant woman. In Uzbekistan, despite people throwing stones at her, she was the first to remove her veil. She was the first woman to dance in Uzbekistan. She understands forty kinds of national music, and her dance expresses a strong national character. Her solo program would take ten consecutive nights to complete. In her dance, she expresses the characteristics of the Uzbek nation, expresses new life and new characters, and her singing and dance both come from the folk. Her coming to China this time is an opportunity for us to learn more and better from her in terms of developing national art.

Soviet dance art has a very deep accumulation. Their ballet school has a history of more than 140 years. After the October Revolution, under the glorious national policies of Lenin and Stalin, the art of all Soviet nationalities, including dance art, along with the development of culture and education, has been unprecedentedly promoted. Many People's Artists have become symbols of revolutionary victory. We welcome them with great enthusiasm and learn from them with infinite admiration.

    我看到了具有高度感染力的舞蹈艺术
    欧阳予倩
    艺术感之所以可贵，正因它感人之深。看了苏联舞蹈艺术家珈丽娜·乌兰诺娃和塔马拉·哈侬的表演，其感染力强到不可思议，好像每条神经每个细胞都被渗透，是喜悦、是愉快、是美，我不知道怎么说好，我只能说我真正感觉到艺术的力量。
    乌兰诺娃是全苏联的人民演员，她的表演是舞蹈艺术最高度的表现。当她表演的时候，动作、表情、线条、音乐、节奏、韵律，没有一样不统一在他的思想感情之中；音乐的旋律、节奏和她的表情、动作完全融合在一起，成为整然浑然极其谐和的一体。她掌握了高度的技术，就很难看得出她运用技术的痕迹，这是异常难能而可贵的。我国舞蹈家戴爱莲同志说：“乌兰诺娃的舞蹈，超过了希腊的雕塑”，我同意她的话。希腊的雕塑，是古代优秀艺术家的作品，乌兰诺娃是今天苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的人民艺术家，她的创作超过希腊的古代艺术，是毫不为奇的。
    在莫斯科我看过她表演“天鹅湖”，又在电影里看到她表演“罗米欧与朱丽叶”，我早有以上的感觉。这一次她到北京表演的不过是古典舞的片断和一些小品，我们很难对他的艺术作全面的了解，可是就只这一点，已足够使人惊讶。我们听到有一个从来没有看过苏联舞剧的观众，他说：“她真像个仙人哪！”我想这种感情是共通的。
    她不仅是一个苏联的人民演员，也是有全世界声誉、为劳动人民所喜爱的艺术家。去年她到意大利，就有很多人从法国、英国坐飞机去看她的表演，有些反动分子想禁止她上演，可是意大利的人民起来反对，结果还是胜利地演出了。
    十三日她到了中央戏剧学院，我们演了几个节目招待她，其中有一个节目是歌剧“青年近卫军”中的一段插曲——奥列格的母亲唱的一段，是用俄文唱的。她很称赞独唱者的技术和音乐修养。另外有一位同志说俄文发音不够正确，但是她说，问题不在俄文发音是否正确，而是歌唱者没有能够充分掌握人物的思想感情。奥列格的母亲当她的儿子被抓去了，她不单只是悲哀，而是反抗的。我们的歌者唱得不够坚强，表现不出斗争性，就不像一个俄罗斯的母亲。——这种指出是非常正确的，必要的，亲切的。这令我们更深切地认识到思想性对于一个艺术品是何等重要。和对苏联其他同志一样，我们对乌兰诺娃同志的印象不仅是她艺术创作的高超，她的深厚的友情也深深地感动了我们。
    至于塔马拉·哈侬同志，我们在电影里头和他见面的回数似乎比乌兰诺娃更多一点，所以一见了他好像很熟的朋友。她的采棉舞和其他几个舞，我们都不感觉生疏。她是一个很大胆，很有战斗性的女性。在乌兹别克不管人家拿石头打她，她第一个去掉了面纱。她是乌兹别克第一个出来跳舞的女子，她懂得四十种民族的音乐，她的舞蹈表现了浓厚的民族色彩，她一个人的节目要一连演十个晚上才能演得完。在她的舞蹈当中，表现了乌兹别克民族的特色，表现了新的生活和新的人物，她的唱歌和舞蹈都是来自民间的。她这一回到中国来，关于发展民族艺术方面，我们正好更多更好地向她学习。
    苏联的舞蹈艺术，是有非常深厚的积累，他们的巴蕾舞学校，已经有一百四十余年的历史。十月革命以后，在列宁斯大林光辉的民族政策底下，所有苏联各民族的艺术，包括舞蹈艺术，随着文化教育的发展，得到了空前的发扬光大，许多人民的艺术家，就成为革命胜利的标帜。我们以高度的热忱欢迎他们，以无限景仰的心情向他们学习。
