The stage backdrop was composed of numerous flags, in front of which hung portraits of the geniuses of mankind, V.I. Lenin and J.V. Stalin, adorned with flowers. The slogan "Long Live the 35th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution!" shone brightly under the lights. On either side were written the historically significant years: "1917-1952".

At 7:00 PM, amidst a storm of sustained applause, J.V. Stalin and his closest comrades appeared on the rostrum. All those present stood and cheered for the great Stalin: "Glory to Stalin!" "Stalin, Ura!"

The celebration of the 35th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution was opened by M. Yasnov, Chairman of the Moscow City Soviet. M. Belukhin, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, delivered a report on the 35th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution (full text to be published separately, see page 2).

Long live the Communist Party of the Soviet Union! Long live J.V. Stalin!" The participants cheered enthusiastically and for a long time.

The celebration concluded with the singing of the Soviet national anthem.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 7th: TASS Moscow, November 7th telegram: To celebrate the 35th anniversary of the founding of the world's first Soviet socialist state, a military parade of the Moscow garrison was held on Red Square on November 7th.

As on past great holidays, Red Square was dressed in festive attire. On the building opposite Lenin's Mausoleum hung the Soviet Union's national emblem, giant portraits of the founder of the Communist Party and leader of the Soviet people, V.I. Lenin and J.V. Stalin, the national flags and emblems of the sixteen union republics, symbolizing the indestructible unity of the Soviet Union and the great friendship of the Soviet peoples. On the bright red flags were written the slogans of the Central Committee of the Communist Party: "Under the banner of Lenin, under the leadership of Stalin, advance towards the victory of communism!" "Long live the friendship and glorious bastion of all nationalities in our country, the indestructible bastion of world peace – the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics!"

Thousands of spectators stood on the granite reviewing stands in front of the Kremlin walls. Participating in this grand event were advanced workers in industry and agriculture, scientists, writers, artists, representatives of the Supreme Soviets of the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation, and ministers from various government departments. Among the guests were trade union, cultural, and youth delegations from Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, the German Democratic Republic, the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea , the People's Republic of Mongolia, and many other countries - France, Britain, Italy, Austria, Finland, Ceylon, New Zealand, Burma and Australia. Also present on Red Square were foreign diplomatic envoys and military attachés.

A few minutes before the start of the inspection, Stalin, accompanied by his closest comrades, ascended the granite reviewing stand above the mausoleum. The people in the square cheered enthusiastically for the great leader. The troops were reviewed by Soviet Marshal S. Timoshenko. Accompanied by General B. Artemyev, he rode past the troops standing in formation and extended festive greetings to them. Subsequently, Marshal Timoshenko delivered a speech to the soldiers of the Soviet Armed Forces, the working people of the Soviet Union, and foreign guests.

Marshal Timoshenko said:

"Comrades soldiers and non-commissioned officers of the Army and Navy! Comrades officers, colonels, and generals of the Army and Navy! Working people of the Soviet Union! Dear guests, foreign friends!

On this great 35th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, I salute you and congratulate you on behalf of and upon the instructions of the Soviet Government and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

The October Revolution, which brought about a fundamental change in world human history from the capitalist world to a new socialist world, its great significance becomes more vividly apparent year after year. After our motherland was liberated from the oppression of landlords, capitalists, and foreigners, it traversed a glorious path of struggle and victory in the Soviet era. Under the immortal banner of Lenin and the wise leadership of the great Stalin, the people of all nationalities in our country eliminated centuries of backwardness and built a multi-ethnic socialist state, which withstood various trials and powerfully demonstrated its strength, especially in the Great Patriotic War.

In the post-war years, the spiritual and political unity of Soviet society has become more consolidated, the sacred Stalin friendship of all nationalities has been further strengthened, and great achievements have been made in all aspects of economy and culture. The material welfare of the Soviet people has been steadily improved.

The Soviet people have also made great achievements this year. We have achieved new victories in the development of industry and transportation. The grain problem has been completely solved - this year the total grain harvest reached eight billion poods. The ideal that our people had for many years to connect the two great Russian rivers, the Volga and the Don, has been realized. The Volga-Don Canal, named after the great Lenin, has been opened to navigation.

The 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was an event of epoch-making significance. The achievements of the Congress vividly illustrate the unbreakable unity and solidarity of our Communist Party ranks. It illustrates their love and unlimited loyalty to the great leader and teacher, Comrade Stalin.

The resolutions of the Party Congress, Comrade Stalin's speeches and his new outstanding works inspire the Soviet people to strive for the victorious completion of the tasks of the Fifth Five-Year Plan. These resolutions unfold before the Party, and before the entire Soviet people, a new and beautiful prospect for our advance towards communism.

We are able to make progress on the road to pursuing our identified goals, all thanks to the correct policy of the Communist Party – the leading and guiding force of Soviet society.

The Soviet Union steadfastly upholds the cause of peace and international cooperation. The Soviet state is uniting with other peace-loving and democratic countries, such as the People's Republic of China, the various people's democratic countries, and the German Democratic Republic, in the struggle to safeguard peace.

The Soviet Union's policy of peace not only enjoys the trust, sympathy, and support of the people's democratic countries that are building socialism, but also the trust, sympathy, and support of all progressive and honest people throughout the world.

Indeed, the warmongers are dreaming of launching another world war and are preparing for it, they are intensifying the arms race, they have been waging a brutal war of aggression against the Korean people for more than two years, and they are trying to provoke many countries against the Soviet Union.

However, the warmongers should know that the people of all countries do not need war, should know that our country is now stronger than ever before, and is able to give a fatal rebuff to any attack by aggressors. The peace and security of our motherland are defended by the heroic Soviet armed forces, and our motherland has all the necessary conditions to crush ambitious aggressors.

Our people can be confident that the Soviet Army and Navy will certainly be able to gloriously complete the tasks entrusted to them, to defend the creative labor of the Soviet people, and to defend the interests of the Soviet state.

Long live the 35th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution!

Long live the heroic Soviet people and their courageous armed force! Long live the Soviet Government!

Long live the Communist Party of the Soviet Union - the inspirator and organizer of all our victories, the Party of Lenin and Stalin!

Long live international peace, down with the warmongers!

Glory to the great leader and teacher, our beloved Stalin!

Ura!"

Marshal Timoshenko's last words were drowned out by a thunderous roar of "Ura" on Red Square. Then, the solemn Soviet national anthem and the sound of salutes resounded over Red Square.

The military parade began. According to tradition, the troops participating in the parade were led by the students of the Frunze Military Academy - the oldest officer training center in the country. This was followed by students from other higher military academies - artillery, tank crew, and air force - as well as a mixed regiment of the Navy. Students of this oldest Soviet officer school, named after the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation, marched in neat rows; this was the sixtieth time they had participated in the Red Square parade. The vigilant sentinels of the Soviet border, the Soviet border guards, marched forward with firm steps, followed by the young students of the Suvorov and Nakhimov schools.

A division of the famous Taman Guards participated in the inspection. Thirty-three people in this division received the high title of Hero of the Soviet Union for their heroic deeds in battle. Following the motorized infantry were artillery units. The artillery forces included cannons of various calibers, anti-aircraft guns, anti-tank guns, heavy howitzers, and "Katyusha" rocket launchers. A tank division brought up the rear as it moved across Red Square, completing the parade.

The Soviet troops, who are protecting the peace and security of the great Soviet homeland, demonstrated excellent training and a high degree of organization in the parade. They were warmly welcomed by the guests in the reviewing stand. After the parade, the festive demonstration of the working people of Moscow began.

    晚间七时，在暴风雨般经久不息的掌声中，约·维·斯大林和他最亲密的战友们在主席台上出现了。到会者全体起立，为伟大的斯大林欢呼：“斯大林光荣！”“斯大林，乌拉！”
    伟大的十月社会主义革命三十五周年庆祝会由莫斯科市苏维埃主席米·雅斯诺夫主持开幕。苏联部长会议副主席米·别尔乌辛在会上作了关于伟大的十月社会主义革命三十五周年的报告（全文另发，见第二版）。
    别尔乌辛的报告不止一次地为掌声打断。他在最后高呼：强大的苏联——和平、民主与社会主义的牢不可破的堡垒万岁！苏联共产党万岁！约·维·斯大林万岁！与会者热烈欢呼，经久不息。
    至此庆祝会在苏联国歌声中结束。
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科七日电：为了庆祝世界上第一个苏维埃社会主义国家建国三十五周年，十一月七日红场上举行了莫斯科卫戍部队的阅兵式。
    像在往常的盛大节日一样，红场穿上了节日的盛装。在列宁陵墓对面的建筑物上悬挂着苏联的国徽，共产党的缔造者、苏联人民的领袖乌·伊·列宁和约·维·斯大林的巨幅画像，十六个加盟共和国的国旗和国徽，象征着苏联的不可摧毁的团结和苏联各族人民的伟大友谊。在鲜红的旗帜上写着共产党中央委员会的口号：“在列宁的旗帜下，在斯大林的领导下，朝着共产主义的胜利前进！”“我国各族人民的友谊和光荣的堡垒、世界和平的不可摧毁的堡垒——伟大的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟万岁！”
    克里姆林宫墙前面的花岗石观礼台上站着成千的观礼者。参加这个盛典的有工农业中的先进工作者、科学家、作家、艺术家、苏联和俄罗斯联邦最高苏维埃的代表们和政府各部部长。在来宾中有：波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、阿尔巴尼亚、德意志民主共和国、中华人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、蒙古人民共和国以及其他许多国家——法国、英国、意大利、奥地利、芬兰、锡兰、新西兰、缅甸和澳大利亚等国的工会、文化和青年代表团。到红场上观礼的还有各国外交使节和武官。
    检阅开始前几分钟，斯大林偕同他的最亲密的战友走上陵墓上面的花岗石检阅台。广场上的人们向伟大的领袖热烈欢呼。检阅部队的是苏联元帅赛·铁木辛哥。他在巴·阿尔杰米也夫上将陪同下，骑马驰过整队而立的部队的面前，并向他们致节日的祝贺。随后，铁木辛哥元帅向苏维埃武装部队的战士们、苏联的劳动人民和外国来宾们发表演说。
    铁木辛哥元帅说：
    “陆海军战士和士官同志们！陆海军尉官、校官和将军同志们！苏联的劳动人民们！亲爱的来宾们，外国朋友们！
    在这伟大的十月社会主义革命三十五周年纪念日，我代表并奉苏联政府和苏联共产党中央委员会之命向你们致敬并祝贺。
    给世界人类历史带来了从资本主义世界走向新的社会主义世界的根本变化的十月革命，它的伟大意义一年比一年更生动地表现出来了。我们的祖国从地主、资本家和外国的压迫下获得解放之后，在苏维埃时代中，走过了斗争和胜利的光荣道路。在不朽的列宁的旗帜下、在伟大的斯大林的英明领导下，我国各族人民消灭了一百年来的落后状态并建成了多民族的社会主义国家，这个国家经过了各种考验，在伟大的卫国战争中，特别有力地表现了它的力量。
    在战后年代里，苏维埃社会精神和政治上的团结更加巩固了，各族人民神圣的斯大林友谊进一步加强了，在经济和文化各方面取得了巨大的成就。苏联人民的物质福利得到了稳步的提高。
    苏联人民在今年也已取得巨大的成就。我们在发展工业和运输业方面取得了新的胜利。谷物问题已完全解决了——今年谷物总收获量达到了八十亿普特。我国人民许多年来要使伏尔加河和顿河这两条伟大的俄罗斯河流汇合的理想已经实现了。以伟大的列宁的名字为名的伏尔加河—顿河运河已经通航了。
    苏联共产党第十九次代表大会是具有划时代意义的一件大事。代表大会的成就极其生动地说明了我们共产党队伍的牢不可破的统一和团结。说明了他们对于伟大的领袖和导师斯大林同志的热爱和无限忠诚。
    党代表大会的决议、斯大林同志的演说和他的新的卓越的著作鼓舞着苏联人民为胜利地完成第五个五年计划的任务而努力。这些决议在党的面前、在全体苏联人民面前展开了我们向共产主义前进的新的美丽的前景。
    我们所以能够在追求我们认定的目标的道路上获得进展，都应该归功于共产党——苏维埃社会的领导和指导力量——的正确政策。
    苏联坚持不渝地维护和平与国际合作的事业。苏维埃国家正在和其他爱好和平的民主国家，如中华人民共和国、各人民民主国家和德意志民主共和国团结一致进行维护和平的斗争。
    苏联的和平政策不仅得到正在建设社会主义的人民民主国家的信任、同情和支持，而且也得到全世界一切进步的和正直的人民的信任、同情和支持。
    的确，战争贩子们正在梦想发动另一次世界大战并且正在为它进行准备，正在加紧进行扩张军备的运动，他们已经把侵略朝鲜人民的残酷的战争进行了两年多了，而且还力图挑拨许多国家反对苏联。
    但是，战争贩子应该知道，世界各国人民不需要战争，应该知道我们的国家现在比以前任何时候更为强大，而且能够对侵略者的任何进攻给以致命的回击。我们祖国的和平、安全有英勇的苏联武装部队保卫着，我们的祖国具备一切必要的条件来粉碎野心的侵略者。
    我们人民可以相信苏联陆军和海军一定能够光荣地完成交付给他们的任务，来保卫苏联人民的创造性劳动、保卫苏联国家的利益。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命三十五周年万岁！
    英雄的苏联人民和他们的勇敢的武装部队万岁！苏维埃政府万岁！
    我们一切胜利的鼓舞者和组织者、列宁和斯大林的党——苏联共产党万岁！
    国际和平万岁，打倒战争贩子！
    伟大的领袖和导师、我们敬爱的斯大林光荣！
    乌拉！”
    铁木辛哥元帅最后的话为红场上一片震耳的乌拉声所淹没。接着，红场上响起了庄严的苏联国歌声和礼炮声。
    阅兵分列式开始。依照传统，参加检阅的部队由伏龙芝军事学院——全国历史最久的军官训练中心——的学生领先。随后是其他高等军事学校——炮兵、坦克手、空军——的学生，以及一个海军混成团。这个历史最久的苏维埃军官学校的学生排成整齐的队伍前进；这个以俄罗斯联邦最高苏维埃为名的学校已经是第六十次参加红场的检阅了。苏维埃边疆的警惕的哨兵苏联边防军踏着坚定的步伐列队前进，随后是苏沃罗夫和纳希莫夫学校的年青学生们。
    著名的塔曼警卫军的一个师参加了检阅。这个师里有三十三个人因为在战斗中的英雄事迹而获得了苏联英雄的崇高称号。摩托化步兵后面是炮兵部队。炮兵部队中有各种口径的大炮、高射炮、反坦克炮、重榴弹炮和“喀秋沙”。最后一个坦克师走过红场，结束了阅兵式。
    正在保卫和平和伟大苏维埃国土的安全的苏联军队在检阅中表现了卓越的训练和高度的组织性。他们受到观礼台上的来宾们的热烈欢迎。阅兵结束后，莫斯科劳动人民的节日示威游行宣告开始。
