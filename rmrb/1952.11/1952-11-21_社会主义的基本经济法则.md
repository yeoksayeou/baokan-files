    The basic economic law of socialism can be roughly characterized by its main features and requirements as follows: to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society by continuously increasing and improving socialist production on the basis of advanced technology."
    —Stalin, "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR."

    In his brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," Comrade Stalin comprehensively elucidated the fundamental problems of socialist political economics, explored the laws of social production and the distribution of material wealth in socialist society, and pointed out the path for the gradual transition from socialism to communism. The 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, based on the programmatic instructions given by Comrade Stalin in this great work of creative Marxism, formulated a great program of economic and cultural construction.

    Comrade Stalin's revelation and demonstration of the basic economic law of modern capitalism and the basic economic law of socialism are of particularly great significance for revolutionary theory and practice, and for the struggle for communism.

    The basic economic law does not determine a certain individual aspect or certain individual processes of the development of a social and economic form, but determines all the main aspects and all the main processes of this development, and determines the essence of a certain mode of production. Revealing and understanding the basic economic law is the key to understanding and explaining all the laws of a certain mode of production.

    Comrade Stalin developed Lenin's theory of imperialism. Based on a profound analysis of the essence of modern capitalism, he pointed out that what monopoly capitalism requires is not just any profit, but the maximum profit necessary to realize expanded reproduction on a fairly regular basis.

    Comrade Stalin pointed out that the main features and requirements of the basic economic law of modern capitalism are:

    "To ensure the maximum capitalist profit by exploiting and bankrupting the majority of the residents of one's own country, by enslaving and constantly plundering the people of other countries, especially the people of backward countries, and by wars and militarization of the national economy aimed at protecting the highest profits."

    The main characteristics and requirements of the basic economic law of socialism, as Comrade Stalin instructed, can be roughly expressed as follows:

    "To ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society by continuously increasing and perfecting socialist production on the basis of advanced technology."

    Comrade Stalin's definitions of the basic economic law of modern capitalism and the basic economic law of socialism reveal the fundamental differences and profound antagonism between the two modes of production. Comrade Stalin's revelation of the basic economic law of modern capitalism and the basic economic law of socialism dealt a fatal blow to all apologists of capitalism and pointed out the great superiority of socialism over capitalism.

    I

    Economic laws are objective laws that reflect the process of economic development and are independent of people's will. Comrade Stalin analyzed the nature of economic laws under the socialist system and pointed out the serious errors of those who believe that they can create, eliminate, or "transform" the laws of economic development. Economic laws are not created by people's will, but arise on the basis of certain economic conditions. However, society is not powerless in the face of laws. People can discover objective laws, understand them, rely on them, and use them for the benefit of society.

    The Communist Party, in formulating its own policies—the lifeblood of the Soviet system—bases itself on the knowledge of the laws of social development. In his classic work "Dialectical and Historical Materialism," Comrade Stalin instructed that the proletarian party should first master the knowledge of the laws of production development and the knowledge of the laws of social and economic development:

    "In order not to make mistakes in politics, the proletarian party, when formulating its own party program and carrying out practical activities, should first start from the laws of production development and the laws of social and economic development."

    Our Party, based on the law that the relations of production must conform to the nature of the productive forces, established the alliance of the working class and the peasantry, ensured the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution, and completed the most profound social and economic transformation.

    Due to this social and economic transformation, the exploitation of man by man was eliminated, and the socialist ownership of the means of production was established as the solid foundation of Soviet society. Our country has become a powerful industrial-collective farm socialist power.

    With the establishment of social ownership, the relations of production have become compatible with the nature of the productive forces, because the social nature of the production process is consolidated by the social ownership of the means of production.

    The new socialist relations of production established in our country are the main and decisive force determining the further and powerful development of the productive forces.

    Comrade Stalin instructed that our industrial productive forces have developed greatly because the old capitalist relations of production were replaced by new socialist relations of production in October 1917. Our agricultural productive forces have developed greatly because the old capitalist relations of production in the countryside were replaced by new collectivized relations of production in the 1930s.

    Without this fundamental change in the relations of production, our productive forces would wither, as they are withering in capitalist countries.

    The basic economic law of socialism, which arises on the basis of new economic conditions, determines the essence of the socialist mode of production and determines all the main aspects and all the main processes of the development of social production under the socialist system. The role of the basic economic law of socialism is to continuously promote the rise and prosperity of the productive forces of socialist society and to continuously improve the material and cultural level of the working people.

    Comrade Stalin, in elucidating the essence of the basic economic law of capitalism and the basic economic law of socialism, profoundly pointed out the difference between the purpose of production and the means to achieve that purpose under the capitalist system and the socialist system.

    The purpose of capitalist production is to obtain profit. Consumption is only necessary for capitalism when it guarantees the completion of the task of obtaining profit. Therefore, people and their needs disappear from the capitalist vision. In capitalist society, people are subject to the cold and ruthless law of monopoly capital to obtain maximum profit. Therefore, the fate of the people is destined to be deep suffering, poverty, unemployment, and bloody wars.

    The decay and degeneration of the capitalist system clearly reveal the groundlessness and absurdity of the sophistry of bourgeois economists and the right-wing socialist agents of imperialism regarding the eternity and immutability of capitalist laws and the reconciliation of the interests of all classes in capitalist society. In fact, the pursuit of maximum profit intensifies the contradictions inherent in capitalism, inevitably leading to the deepening of the general crisis of capitalism, and leading to the growth and outbreak of contradictions in capitalist society.

    In contrast to capitalism, the purpose of socialist production is not profit, but people and their needs, that is, to maximize the satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society. In socialist society, all production is subject to people and their growing needs. This is the greatest superiority of the new social system—communism—which is more advanced than capitalism. Under socialist conditions, social production is for the first time in human history under the conscious control of society, serving the interests of the working people and fulfilling the task of satisfying their growing needs.

    The great experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union powerfully confirms Lenin's prediction, which he wrote on the eve of the October Revolution in 1917: Expropriating the capitalists "makes possible the tremendous development of the productive forces. We see how severely capitalism is now hindering this development, how much could be advanced on the basis of the technology that has been achieved today, so we have the right to say with full confidence that the expropriation of the capitalists will inevitably lead to a tremendous development of the productive forces of human society." (Complete Works of Lenin, Volume 25, Page 440)

    The social production of the Soviet Union, which is in the hands of the working people, can have no other purpose than to meet the growing material and cultural needs of society and to develop the material and spiritual strength of society.

    It should be pointed out here that the needs of socialist society cannot be simply reduced to the individual needs of members of society. Marx pointed out in "Critique of the Gotha Program" what needs socialist society should meet and how it will distribute public social products. Social products should be used to compensate for consumed means of production, expand production, establish reserve funds and insurance funds, pay administrative fees, maintain social and cultural facilities and health care, support people without the ability to work, and meet the personal needs of working people. Marx emphasized here: "What the producers have lost in their private capacity, they receive back directly or indirectly in their capacity as members of society."

    With the change in the purpose of production under the socialist system, the means used to achieve this purpose have also fundamentally changed. Under the capitalist system, the increasingly intensified exploitation of the working people, the enslavement and plunder of other nations, militarization, and bloody wars are the means to ensure the achievement of maximum profit. Under the socialist system, ensuring the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of society is achieved by continuously improving and perfecting socialist production on the basis of advanced technology. The Communist Party, taking into account the requirements of the basic economic law of socialism, organizes the working people to strive for the continuous growth of the entire social production of socialism under the condition of first increasing the production of the means of production. The growth of the material and cultural needs of socialist society is a powerful driving force for expanding production and perfecting production.

    The socialist system gives unlimited scope to the adoption of the latest technology. In the Soviet Union, machines not only save labor, but also lighten the labor of staff. Therefore, unlike under capitalist conditions, workers are extremely willing to use machines in the labor process under socialist production conditions.

    The Communist Party attaches great importance to the development of science and technology, and has established creative cooperation between scientific workers and production in order to further develop and improve socialist production on a high technological basis.

    Therefore, under socialist conditions, it is not ensuring maximum profit, but maximizing the satisfaction of the material and cultural needs of society; it is not the development of production with intermittent states from rise to crisis and from crisis to rise as under capitalism, but the continuous growth of production; it is not the periodic intermittent state in technological development that comes with the destruction of social productive forces under the capitalist system, but the continuous perfection of production on a high technological basis.

    The basic economic law of socialism determines the essence of public socialist production. The task of socialist production is contained in the basic economic law of socialism. Therefore, all other socialist economic laws that determine the individual aspects and individual processes of the development of the socialist mode of production are subject to the requirements of the basic economic law of socialism. These laws can only play a role based on the basic economic law.

    Comrade Stalin, in explaining the interrelationship between the basic economic law of socialism and the law of planned and proportional development of the national economy, criticized the views of those economists who believed that the basic economic law of socialism is the law of planned and proportional development of the national economy.

    The law of planned development of the national economy cannot be the basic economic law of socialism, because it cannot answer the question of what task the planned development of the national economy is carried out for. This task is contained in the basic economic law of socialism as the requirement of the basic economic law of socialism. Therefore, the role of the law of planned development of the national economy can only be fully exerted when it is based on the basic economic law of socialism.

    The law of planned and proportional development of the national economy arises on the basis of the socialization of the means of production, and arises as the opposite of the law of competition and anarchy of production under the capitalist system. It begins to play a role because planned and proportional development is objectively necessary for the socialist national economy.

    Based on a scientific analysis of the relationship between the basic economic law of socialism and the law of planned and proportional development of the national economy, Comrade Stalin formulated the important principle of the task of national economic planning. National economic planning can only produce good results if it correctly reflects the requirements of the law of planned development of the national economy and is in all aspects suitable to the requirements of the basic economic law of socialism. Stalin's principle is clearly embodied in the directives of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party on the Fifth Five-Year Plan for the development of the Soviet Union.

    II

    The role of the basic economic law of socialism and the role of the economic law of modern capitalism determine two lines of economic development—the line of continuous growth of the socialist camp economy and the line of the decadent capitalist economy struggling under the pressure of the deepening general crisis of capitalism.

    The following figures give us a clear idea of these two lines. In the period from 1929 to 1951, the industrial output of the Soviet Union increased almost thirteen times. During the same period, the industrial output of the United States increased two times, that of Britain increased by 60 percent, and the industry of many other Western European countries was still treading water around the 1929 level.

    The fundamental difference between the basic economic law of modern capitalism and the basic economic law of socialism is particularly evident when comparing the material and cultural level of the working people in capitalist countries with that of the working people in the Soviet Union. The material level of the working people in capitalist countries is falling heavily.

    Currently, the cost of living in the United States is almost twice as high as in 1939, and the direct taxes of residents in the current budget year have increased more than eleven times compared with the 1937-1938 budget year (including currency devaluation). In France and Italy, the real wages of workers in 1952 were still less than half of the pre-war level. In Britain, the real wages of workers were reduced by 20 percent compared with the pre-war level. The basic economic law of capitalism deepens the relative and absolute impoverishment of workers, and increases unemployment and the poverty of working people.

    There are at least three million fully unemployed workers and ten million partially unemployed workers in the United States. The number of unemployed workers in Italy and West Germany exceeds the level of the most serious years of the world economic crisis, 1929-1933. In Japan, there are about ten million fully unemployed and partially unemployed workers. The sharp deterioration of the material conditions of the working people in capitalist countries is causing the growing dissatisfaction of the masses and the sharpening of class contradictions.

    The basic economic law of socialism enables the material welfare and cultural level of the working people in socialist society to continuously grow. Unlike the national income of capitalist countries, the national income of the Soviet Union belongs entirely to the working people. In the period from 1940 to 1951, the national income of the Soviet Union increased by 83 percent. About three-quarters of our country's laboring people receive national income to meet individual material and cultural needs, and the remaining part is used to expand socialist production and meet national and social needs. The real wages of workers and staff and the real income of peasants are gradually increasing.

    In the Soviet Union, huge residential buildings and public buildings are being completed year after year. Special care is given to the health care of the Soviet people, the mortality rate is reduced, and the population increases. In the past three years alone, the net increase in the Soviet population was 9.5 million. Cultural construction in the Soviet Union is being carried out more and more extensively, and the cultural level of the working people in urban and rural areas is rapidly improving.

    The role of the basic economic law of socialism further consolidates socialist society and continuously promotes the rise of all material and spiritual forces of society. The working people of our country, united around the Lenin-Stalin Party, are solving the great tasks of communist construction.

    The Communist Party, based on the knowledge of socialist economic laws and the science of building a communist society studied by Comrade Stalin, has formulated future plans.

    Comrade Stalin taught that the transition to a communist society can only be achieved through many stages of economic and cultural re-education of society. In this process, labor will change from merely a means of subsistence to the first life need of society, and public ownership will become the inviolable and solid foundation of social existence.

    In order to prepare in practice for the transition from socialism to communism, Comrade Stalin instructed that at least three basic prerequisites must be met. First, it is necessary to ensure the continuous growth of total social production, with the growth of the production of the means of production taking priority. Without the growth of the production of the means of production, it is impossible to realize expanded reproduction.

    Second, it is necessary to raise collective farm ownership to the level of public ownership by implementing measures that are conducive to the gradual transition of collective farms, and also to replace commodity circulation with a gradual transition to a system of product exchange.

    Third, it is necessary to bring society to such a high level of cultural development that all members of society are guaranteed the comprehensive development of their physical and mental powers, so that members of society can obtain an education sufficient to become active actors in social development, and can freely choose their occupations without being bound to a certain occupation for life due to the existing division of labor.

    Only when all these prerequisites are met can the true foundation be created for the transition from the socialist formula "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work" to the communist principle "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs."

    Based on Comrade Stalin's programmatic principles, the 19th Party Congress adopted the directives on the Fifth Five-Year Plan for the Development of the Soviet Union from 1951 to 1955, which envisages a powerful new upsurge in all sectors of the national economy and the material welfare and culture of the people.

    During the five years, the level of industrial production will increase by about 70 percent. This means that the scale of industrial production in 1955 will be three times the level of 1940. It is stipulated that the total industrial output will increase by an average of about 12 percent per year during the five years, of which the increase rate of the production of the means of production will be 13 percent, and the increase rate of the production of consumer goods will be 11 percent.

    The prioritized growth of the production of the means of production indicates the further powerful development of the various departments of heavy industry—the metallurgical industry of ferrous and non-ferrous metals, the coal mining industry, and the petroleum industry. Special attention is paid to the electrification of the country. Based on Lenin's famous principle that communism is Soviet power plus electrification of the whole country, the Communist Party ensures the rapid increase in the power equipment of our national economy. In the Soviet Union, the construction of large power stations has developed on an unprecedented scale.

    One of the most important tasks of the Fifth Five-Year Plan is to further develop the Soviet machine-building industry, which will serve as the basis for new and high-speed technological progress in all sectors of the Soviet national economy.

    In agriculture, it is planned to further improve agriculture and animal husbandry, increase the yields of all crops, and increase the number of publicly owned livestock while increasing their product productivity.

    The new Five-Year Plan guarantees a further improvement in the material welfare of the Soviet people. The national income will increase by at least 60 percent during the five years, thereby expanding the income of workers and staff and the income of peasants. The real wages of workers and staff will increase by at least 35 percent during the five years, and the real income of collective farm members will increase by at least 40 percent.

    The Fifth Five-Year Plan envisages a new cultural upsurge of the Soviet people and the further development of advanced Soviet science and national education.

    The Fifth Five-Year Plan embodies the requirements of the basic economic law of socialism. Completing this plan is a new big step forward on the road from socialism to communism. Under the leadership of the Lenin-Stalin Party, the Soviet people are fighting with great enthusiasm to successfully complete the new Five-Year Plan.

    Comrade Stalin's revelation and demonstration of the basic economic law of socialism has pointed out a clear vision of continuous progress for the Communist Party and the working people of our country.

    Comrade Stalin's work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" has worldwide historical significance. Comrade Stalin creatively enriched and developed Marxism-Leninism with his theoretical discoveries. The ideas of the great Stalin inspire the Soviet people to build communism, inspire the working people of the people's democratic countries to achieve new successes in building a new life, and point out the road for the working people of the world to struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism.

    社会主义的基本经济法则
    苏联  索勃里
    “社会主义基本经济法则的主要特点和要求，可以大致表述如下：用在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善的办法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。”
    ——斯大林“苏联社会主义经济问题”。
    斯大林同志在其天才的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中全面地阐明了社会主义政治经济学的根本问题，探讨了社会主义社会中社会生产的法则和物质财富分配的法则，指出了由社会主义逐步过渡到共产主义的道路。苏联共产党第十九次代表大会以斯大林同志在这一创造性的马克思主义的伟大著作中所给予的纲领性的指示为其决议的基础，制订了经济和文化建设的伟大纲领。
    斯大林同志对现代资本主义基本经济法则和社会主义基本经济法则的揭示和论证，对于革命的理论和实践及对于争取共产主义的斗争有着特别重大的意义。
    基本经济法则不是决定一个社会经济形态发展的某一个别方面或某些个别过程，而是决定这一发展的一切主要方面和一切主要过程，决定某一生产方式的本质的。揭发和认识基本经济法则，是认识和说明某一生产方式的一切规律的关键。
    斯大林同志发展了列宁关于帝国主义的理论，他根据对现代资本主义的本质的深刻分析指出：垄断资本主义所要求的不是随便什么利润，而是相当经常地实现扩大再生产所必需的最大限度的利润。
    斯大林同志指出，现代资本主义基本经济法则的主要特点和要求是：
    “用剥削本国大多数居民并使他们破产和贫困的办法，用奴役和不断掠夺其他国家人民、特别是落后国家人民的办法，以及用旨在保护最高利润的战争和国民经济军事化的办法，来保证最大限度的资本主义利润。”
    社会主义基本经济法则的主要特征和要求，如斯大林同志所指示的，可以大致表述如下：
    “用在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善的办法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。”
    斯大林关于现代资本主义基本经济法则和社会主义基本经济法则的定义，揭露了两种生产方式的根本区别和深刻的对立性。斯大林同志对现代资本主义基本经济法则和社会主义基本经济法则的揭发，给了资本主义的一切辩护人一个致命的打击，指出了社会主义对于资本主义的伟大的优越性。
    一
    经济法则是反映不以人们的意志为转移的经济发展过程的客观法则。斯大林同志分析了社会主义制度下的经济法则的性质，指出那些认为能够创造、消灭或“改造”经济发展法则的人们的严重错误。经济法则不是由人们的意志创造出来，而是在一定经济条件的基础上产生的。然而社会在法则面前并不是无能为力的。人们能发现客观规律，认识它们，依靠它们，利用它们来为社会谋福利。
    共产党在制订自己的政策——苏维埃制度的生命基础时，就是以社会发展法则的知识为依据的。斯大林同志在经典性的著作“辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义”中指示说，无产阶级的政党应当首先掌握生产发展法则的知识，社会经济发展法则的知识：
    “为了在政治上不犯错误，无产阶级党在制定自己的党纲以及进行实际活动时，首先应以生产发展底规律，应以社会经济发展底规律为出发点。”
    我们的党依据生产关系一定要适合生产力的性质这一法则，建立了工人阶级和农民的联盟，保证了伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利，完成了最深刻的社会的和经济的改造。
    由于这种社会的和经济的改造，消灭了人对人的剥削，而生产工具和生产资料的社会主义所有制被确立为苏维埃社会的牢固基础。我们的国家变成了强大的工业—集体农庄的社会主义强国。
    随着社会所有制的确立，生产关系成为和生产力的性质相适合的了，因为生产过程的社会性质为生产资料的社会所有制所巩固着。
    在我国建立起来的新的社会主义的生产关系，是决定生产力进一步的、而且是强大的发展的主要的和决定的力量。
    斯大林同志指示说，我国工业生产力有巨大的发展，那是因为在一九一七年十月用新的社会主义的生产关系代替了旧的资本主义的生产关系。我国农业生产力有巨大的发展，是因为在三十年代用新的集体化的生产关系代替了农村中旧的资本主义的生产关系。
    没有生产关系中的这种根本变革，我国的生产力就会萎靡下去，如像它现时在资本主义国家中萎靡的情形一样。
    在新经济条件的基础上产生的社会主义基本经济法则，决定社会主义生产方式的本质，决定社会主义制度下社会生产发展的一切主要方面和一切主要过程。社会主义基本经济法则的作用，使社会主义社会的生产力不断高涨和繁荣，使劳动人民的物质和文化水平不断提高。
    斯大林同志在阐发资本主义基本经济法则和社会主义基本经济法则的本质时，极其深刻地指出了在资本主义制度下和社会主义制度下的生产目的和达到该目的的手段的区别。
    资本主义生产的目的是取得利润，只有在保证完成取得利润这一任务的情形下，消费才对于资本主义是需要的。所以，人及其需要就从资本主义的视野中消逝。在资本主义社会里，人服从于垄断资本取得最大限度的利润的冷酷无情的法则。因此，人们的命运被注定为深重的苦难、贫穷、失业和流血的战争。
    资本主义制度的腐朽和堕落，显明地揭发了资产阶级经济学家和帝国主义的右派社会主义代理人关于资本主义法则的永恒性和不可动摇性、关于资本主义社会各阶级利益调和的诡辩的论断的毫无根据和荒谬性。事实上，追逐最大限度的利润使资本主义所固有的矛盾更加尖锐化，必不可免地引向资本主义总危机的深刻化，引向资本主义社会矛盾的增长和爆发。
    与资本主义相反，社会主义生产的目的不是利润，而是人及其需要，即最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长着的物质和文化需要。在社会主义社会里，一切生产服从于人及其不断增长的需要。比资本主义高级的新社会制度——共产主义的最伟大的优越性就在于此。在社会主义条件下，社会生产在人类历史上第一次地处于社会的自觉的统治之下，为劳动人民的利益、为完成满足他们增长着的需要的任务而服务。
    苏联社会主义建设的伟大经验极其有力地证实了列宁的预言，他在一九一七年十月革命的前夜写道：剥夺资本家“使生产力的巨大发展成为可能。我们看到，现在资本主义如何严重地阻碍着这一发展，有多少事物可能在现代已达到的技术基础上推向前进，所以我们有权利以充分的信心说，剥夺资本家必然会使人类社会生产力有巨大的发展。”（列宁全集第二十五卷，第四四○页）
    掌握在劳动人民手中的苏联的社会生产，除了满足社会的增长着的物质和文化需要、发展社会的物质和精神力量以外，不可能有其他的目的。
    这里应当指出，社会主义社会的需要，不能仅仅归结为社会成员的个人需要。马克思在“哥达纲领批判”中就曾指出过社会主义社会应当满足什么需要和它将怎样分配公共的社会产品。社会产品应该用来抵偿消费了的生产资料，扩大生产，设立后备基金和保险基金，支付管理费，维持社会文化设施和保健事业，赡养没有劳动能力的人以及满足劳动人民的个人需要。马克思在这里强调指出说：“生产者在以私人的资格所丧失了的，又直接或间接地以社会成员的资格收回来。”
    随着社会主义制度下生产的目的的改变，为达到这一目的而采用的手段也根本改变了。在资本主义制度下，对劳动人民的越来越加强的剥削、对其他民族的奴役和掠夺、军事化和流血的战争，是保证取得最大限度的利润的手段。在社会主义制度下，保证最大限度地满足社会经常增长的物质的和文化的需要，是用在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断提高和不断完善的办法来达到的。共产党考虑到社会主义基本经济法则的要求，组织劳动人民在首先提高生产资料生产的条件下为争取社会主义的全部社会生产的不断增长而斗争。社会主义社会物质的和文化的需要的增长，是扩大生产和使生产完善的强大推动力。
    社会主义制度对于最新技术的采用给予无限广阔的余地。在苏联，机器不仅节省劳动，而且同时还减轻工作人员的劳动，所以，在社会主义生产条件下和在资本主义条件下不同，工人是极乐意在劳动过程中运用机器的。
    共产党十分注重科学和技术的发展，建立了科学工作者和生产的创造性的合作，以便使社会主义生产在高度技术基础上进一步发展和完善起来。
    所以，在社会主义条件下，不是保证最大限度的利润，而是最大限度地满足社会的物质和文化的需要；不是像在资本主义下那样带有从高涨到危机以及从危机到高涨的间歇状态的生产发展，而是生产的不断增长；不是伴随着资本主义制度下社会生产力的破坏而来的技术发展中的周期性的间歇状态，而是生产在高度技术基础上的不断完善。
    社会主义的基本经济法则决定公共的社会主义生产的本质。社会主义生产的任务包含在社会主义基本经济法则中。所以，决定社会主义生产方式发展的个别方面和个别过程的其他一切社会主义经济法则，服从于社会主义基本经济法则的要求。这些法则只有依据于基本经济法则才能发生作用。
    斯大林同志在说明社会主义基本经济法则和国民经济有计划的、按比例发展的法则的相互联系时，批评了那些认为社会主义基本经济法则是国民经济有计划的、按比例发展法则的经济学家的观点。
    国民经济有计划发展的法则不能是社会主义的基本经济法则，因为它不能回答国民经济有计划的发展是为着什么任务而进行的问题。这一任务作为社会主义基本经济法则的要求而包含在社会主义基本经济法则中。所以，国民经济有计划发展法则的作用，只是在它以社会主义基本经济法则为依据时，才能充分发挥起来。
    国民经济有计划的、按比例发展的法则是在生产资料社会化的基础上产生的，是作为资本主义制度下竞争和生产无政府状态的法则的对立物而产生的。它所以开始发生作用，是因为有计划的、按比例的发展对于社会主义的国民经济是客观的必需。
    斯大林同志根据对社会主义基本经济法则和国民经济有计划的、按比例发展的法则的关系的科学分析，制订了国民经济计划化的任务的重要原理。国民经济计划化只有在正确反映国民经济有计划发展法则的要求和在各方面都适合社会主义基本经济法则的要求的条件下，才能产生良好的结果。斯大林的这个原理，在共产党第十九次代表大会关于苏联发展第五个五年计划的指示中得到了显明的体现。
    二
    社会主义基本经济法则的作用和现代资本主义经济法则的作用，决定了经济发展的两条路线——社会主义阵营经济不断增长的路线和在日益加深的资本主义总危机的高压下挣扎的腐朽的资本主义经济路线。
    下面的数字给予我们关于这两条路线的清楚的概念。在从一九二九年到一九五一年的期间内，苏联的工业产品几乎增加到十三倍。在这同一期间内，美国的工业产品增加到两倍，英国的增加了百分之六十，而西欧其他许多国家的工业仍然在一九二九年水平的周围踏步不前。
    现代资本主义基本经济法则和社会主义基本经济法则的根本区别，在把资本主义国家劳动人民和苏联劳动人民的物质和文化水平作一比较时，是看得特别明显的。资本主义国家的劳动人民生活的物质水平惨重地下降着。
    现在，美国的生活费比一九三九年提高了几乎两倍，本预算年度中的居民直接税比一九三七—一九三八预算年度增长了十一倍以上（连货币的贬值计算在内）。在法国和意大利，一九五二年工人的实际工资还不及战前的一半，在英国，工人的实际工资比战前减少了百分之二十。资本主义基本经济法则使工人的相对的和绝对的贫穷化加深，使失业和劳动人民的贫困增长。
    美国有至少三百万完全失业工人和一千万部分失业工人。意大利和西德的失业工人的数目，超过世界经济危机最严重的年代一九二九——一九三三年的水平。在日本，约有一千万左右完全失业和部分失业的工人。资本主义国家劳动人民物质状况的急剧恶化，使得人民群众的不满情绪日益增长和阶级矛盾尖锐化。
    社会主义基本经济法则使社会主义社会劳动人民的物质福利和文化水平不断增长。苏联的国民收入和资本主义国家的国民收入不同，它全部属于劳动人民。在从一九四○年到一九五一年的期间内，苏联的国民收入增长了百分之八十三。我国劳动人民为满足个人的物质和文化的需要而得到国民收入的四分之三左右，其余一部分用于扩大社会主义生产和全国的及社会的需要。工人和职员的实际工资以及农民的实际收入在逐步提高。
    在苏联，巨大的住宅建筑和公共建筑一年一年地在完成着，苏联人民的保健受到了特别的关怀，死亡率减低，人口的增加，仅最近三年以来，苏联人口纯粹增加的数目是九百五十万人。苏联的文化建设日益广泛地开展，城乡劳动人民的文化水平迅速提高。
    社会主义基本经济法则的作用使社会主义社会进
    一步巩固，使社会的一切物质和精神力量不断高涨。团结在列宁—斯大林党周围的我国劳动人民，正在解决着伟大的共产主义建设任务。
    共产党依据着社会主义经济法则的知识和斯大林同志所研究出的建设共产主义社会的科学，制订了将来的计划。
    斯大林同志教导说，向共产主义社会的过渡，通过社会的经济和文化的重新教育的许多阶段才能实现。在这个过程中，劳动将从仅仅是维持生活的手段变为社会的第一个生活需要，而公共的所有制将成为社会存在的不可侵犯的牢固基础。
    为了准备在实际上从社会主义过渡到共产主义，斯大林同志指示说，至少必须实现三个基本的先决条件。第一，必须保证全部社会生产的不断增长，而生产资料生产的增长要占优先地位，没有生产资料生产的增长就不可能实现扩大再生产。
    第二，必须用实行起来有利于集体农庄的逐渐过渡的办法，来把集体农庄所有制提高到全民所有制的水平，并且也用逐渐过渡的办法使产品交换制来代替商品流通。
    第三，必须使社会达到这样高度的文化发展，保证社会一切成员全面发展他们的体力和智力，使社会成员能获得足以成为社会发展的积极活动家的教育，能自由地选择职业，而不致由于现存的劳动分工而终身束缚于某一种职业。
    只有全部实现这些先决条件，才可以创造从社会主义的公式“各尽所能，按劳取酬”过渡到共产主义的原则“各尽所能，各取所需”的真实基础。
    第十九次党代表大会根据斯大林同志的纲领性的原理，通过了关于一九五一年——一九五五年苏联发展的第五个五年计划的指示，该计划预计着国民经济一切部门和人民的物质福利与文化的强大的新高涨。
    在五年期间，工业生产水平将提高约百分之七十。这就是说，一九五五年工业生产的规模将提高到一九四○年的水平的三倍。规定五年期间工业总产量每年平均约增加百分之十二，其中生产资料生产的增加率为百分之十三，消费资料生产的增加率为百分之十一。
    生产资料生产的占优先地位的增长，表明着重工业各部门——黑色金属和有色金属的冶金业、采煤工业和石油工业——进一步的强大发展。对于国家的电气化给予了特别的注意。根据着列宁的共产主义是苏维埃政权加上全国电气化的著名原理，共产党保证迅速增加我国国民经济的电力装备。在苏联，大电力站的建设以空前的规模发展起来。
    第五个五年计划的最重要任务之一，是进一步发展苏联的机器制造业，以为苏联国民经济各部门中新的高速度的技术进步的基础。
    在农业方面，预计要进一步提高农业和牲畜饲养业，增加一切农作物的收获量，增加公有的牲畜头数同时提高其产物生产率。
    新五年计划保证进一步提高苏联人民的物质福利。在五年期间国民收入至少增加百分之六十，由此将扩大职工的收入和农民的收入。职工的实际工资在五年期间至少增加百分之三十五，集体农庄庄员的实际收入至少增加百分之四十。
    第五个五年计划预计着苏联人民的新的文化高涨和先进的苏维埃科学及国民教育的进一步发展。
    第五个五年计划表现了社会主义基本经济法则的要求。完成这一计划就是沿着从社会主义到共产主义的道路迈进新的一大步。苏联人民在列宁—斯大林党的领导下，正在以极大的热情为胜利完成新五年计划而斗争。
    斯大林同志对社会主义基本经济法则的揭示和论证，给共产党和我国劳动人民指出了不断前进的清楚的远景。
    斯大林同志的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”有着全世界的历史意义。斯大林同志用他的理论上的发现创造性地丰富和发展了马克思—列宁主义。伟大的斯大林的思想鼓舞着苏联人民建设共产主义，鼓舞着人民民主国家的劳动人民在建设新生活中获得新的成就，给全世界劳动人民指出了争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争道路。
