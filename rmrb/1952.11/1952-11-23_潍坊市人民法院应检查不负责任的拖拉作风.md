    To the Editor: In December 1951, our office entrusted "Fangzi Qunxing Business Firm" in Weifang City, Shandong Province, to purchase jute on our behalf as raw material for the sack industry. We paid the firm 40 million yuan as a deposit, with someone guaranteeing the purchase. Later, because the price was not appropriate, the entrusted purchase was cancelled, and we requested the return of 20 million yuan of the deposit from the business firm. Subsequently, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements began, and Lin Ruiwu, the manager of the business firm, was arrested by the Weifang People's Court for illegal activities. As a result, the 20 million yuan owed to our office by the firm has not been returned. On February 4th of this year, our office filed a lawsuit with the Weifang People's Court according to the law, requesting a resolution. The court accepted the case, but nearly ten months have passed without any action. During this period, we have sent eleven written reminders, all of which seem to have disappeared without a trace. We have also sent people to contact the court seven times, but were only met with perfunctory responses and excuses. Such procrastination fully demonstrates the court's irresponsible attitude towards the people's property. Especially since the launch of the judicial reform movement, there has been no sign of improvement in this attitude. The court should conduct a thorough investigation and publish the results in the newspaper.

### 潍坊市人民法院应检查不负责任的拖拉作风

    潍坊市人民法院应检查不负责任的拖拉作风
    编辑同志：我处在一九五一年十二月间，为收购麻纺工业原料，委托山东省潍坊市“坊子群兴商行”代购?麻，有人保证，并交给该行订款四千万元。后来因为价格不适当，委托收购事即作罢，当向该商行索回订款二千万元。接着“三反”、“五反”运动开始，该商行经理林瑞五因有违法行为，被潍坊市人民法院逮捕，于是该行欠本处的二千万元便一直没有还。今年二月四日，本处依法向潍坊市人民法院起诉，请求解决。该院受理后，到现在已近十个月还没有处理。这当中，我们曾经书面催过十一次，都好像石沉大海；还曾经派人前去该院联系过七次，也只是搪塞，敷衍一下。这样的拖拉，十足表现了该院对人民财产不负责的态度。特别是开展司法改革运动以来，仍然不见该院对这种态度有什么改进。该院应该深入检查，并且把检查结果在报上发表。
