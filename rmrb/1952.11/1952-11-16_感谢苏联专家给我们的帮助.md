Thanks to Soviet Experts for Their Help
Xuē Qí, Secretary of the CCP Hegang Municipal Committee and Director of the Hegang Mining Bureau

Over the past three years, our Hegang Coal Mine, with the hard work of all employees and the sincere help of Soviet coal mining experts, has taken on a new look.

Accepting the advanced technology and experience of Soviet experts, we have adopted new coal mining methods to replace the predatory coal mining methods left over from imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism. The workers have gradually been freed from heavy physical labor and have learned to operate machinery. Now, 80 percent of our coal miners use mechanized mining.

In production management, we are implementing the method of managing production according to instruction charts. In the past, workers entering the mine were mostly temporarily assigned by the pit leader, which led to chaotic work order and serious wasted work time. In order to overcome this phenomenon, Soviet experts helped us to link all types of work and procedures according to the production process, design requirements, and safety measures, and to create production instruction charts. In this way, after the workers enter the mine, they know what to expect, clearly understand the time, location, tasks, and workload, and can carry out production in a regular and rhythmic manner.

With the Soviet experts’ high regard for worker safety, our safety work has also been greatly improved. In order to ensure mining safety and expand the recovery rate, Soviet experts suggested that the roof should be well managed. At that time, our engineering and technical personnel did not believe that the roof could be managed, so the Soviet experts divided the roof into four grades according to the nature of the rock, and controlled and managed the roof according to different grades. Now, our casualty accidents have been greatly reduced. For example, in Xing’an Mine, personal injury accidents in 1951 decreased by 61.1 percent compared with 1950.

Our geological drilling work has also made great progress with the help of Soviet experts, and the technical level of drilling work cadres has also been generally improved, laying the foundation for future coal mine infrastructure construction. After the Soviet experts came to Hegang, they helped us with the design work, and taught us without reservation everything from the placement of drilling positions to the wiring methods, coal seam contour calculation methods, and accurate burial amount calculation methods. When they saw that the rock cores in our drilling team's rock core box were messy and the sequence numbers could not be found, they gave us advice on how to strengthen the preservation of rock cores. In the past, because the technicians had no idea what to do, they randomly drilled holes everywhere, moving house today and shifting holes tomorrow, which caused a lot of waste. The workers also complained that the leaders and technicians were not solving the problem. After the Soviet experts came, they personally went to the site to teach us: to determine the fault, location, and depth based on several drilling situations. Now, every hole we drill is useful. In order to help us make drilling location design drawings, geological expert Xie Liangjiski stayed up for two consecutive nights without sleep. With the help of Soviet experts who are so loyal and devoted, the technical level of the geological exploration team has been improved, and technician Wu Wenhai has been able to independently make maps and general shaft information. The Ma Wenzhi-style rapid drilling team No. 302 exceeded the monthly task by 2 percent in July this year. Engineer Yang Tingzhen said: “The Soviet experts couldn’t be more meticulous. If they didn’t get it right the first time, they would do it again. They never seemed impatient and always advised us not to be discouraged. They often told us: When the Soviet Union was first building, it was just like China. As long as we are willing to work hard, we will definitely succeed.” Technician Ren Fengyu said: “I have been working in surveying for 14 years and have never met anyone as meticulous as the Soviet experts.”

With the help of Soviet experts, we overcame incorrect views on wage work and carried out wage reform work. Now, on the basis of improving working conditions, improving labor organization, and having technical quotas, 16 fields (accounting for 80 percent of the coal mining fields in the bureau) have implemented all "separate mining piece-rate wages." At the same time, Soviet experts helped us train more than 80 cadres to manage wages.

The Soviet experts' highly responsible spirit is reflected in their careful consideration of every specific task. Soviet expert Kaoranov, after completing the preliminary design of the Dongshan Shaft, went to the site to carefully compare it with the blueprints. Due to the lack of original materials for the highest water level of the Xiaoheli River in Xing'antai, he personally asked local residents about the water level over the years, and kindly explained to us the relationship between the water level and the life of the wellhead. He immediately made serious demands on places where we had incomplete preparations. When determining each mining area, he would make several plans and repeatedly compare them. The purpose was to save national resources on the one hand, and to improve our technical level on the other.

Soviet experts are concerned about the workers' lives and welfare in every possible way. When designing workers' housing, they considered not building it too far from the wellhead to avoid fatigue for the workers when walking; since the northeast has mostly northwest winds in winter, they considered not building the housing in the southeast to avoid workers inhaling too much coal dust and soot, which is harmful to their health. The noble communist morality and sincere and selfless friendship of Soviet experts are really worth learning from.

### 感谢苏联专家给我们的帮助

    感谢苏联专家给我们的帮助
    中共鹤冈市委书记、鹤冈矿务局局长　薛奇
    三年来，我们鹤冈煤矿，在全体职工的辛勤努力和苏联煤矿专家的真诚帮助下，出现了新的面貌。
    接受苏联专家的先进技术和经验，我们采用了新的采煤方法，代替了过去帝国主义和官僚资本主义遗留下来的掠夺式的采煤方法。职工们逐渐摆脱了笨重的体力劳动，学会运用机械操作，现在，我们已有百分之八十的采煤工用机械采煤了。
    在管理生产上，我们正在贯彻按指示图表管理生产的方法。过去工人入井工作，多由坑长临时指派，工作秩序混乱，窝工现象严重。为克服这种现象，苏联专家帮助我们按生产过程、设计要求、安全措施，把所有工种工序联结起来，制成生产指示图。这样，工人下井后，心中有数，明确了时间、地点、任务和工作量，可以进行有规律有节奏的生产。
    在苏联专家对工人安全的高度关怀下，我们的安全工作也有不少改进。为了采煤安全，扩大回采率，苏联专家提出应该很好管理顶板的意见。当时，我们的工程技术人员不相信顶板可以管理，苏联专家便把顶板按岩石性质分成四级，根据不同的级别进行对顶板的控制与管理。现在，我们的伤亡事故，已大大减少。如兴山矿，一九五一年人身事故，比一九五○年降低百分之六十一点一。
    我们的地质钻探工作，在苏联专家的帮助下，也有很大进步，钻探工作干部的技术水平，也普遍提高了，给今后的煤矿基本建设打下了基础。苏联专家来到鹤冈后，便帮助我们做设计工作，把从钻探的位置配备到引线方法、煤层等高线计算方法、埋藏量准确计算方法等，都毫无保留地教给我们。当他们看到我们钻探队的岩芯箱内，岩芯杂乱，找不出顺序号码时，便对我们提出如何加强岩芯保管的意见。过去，钻探时因为技术员心中无数，到处乱打钻孔，今天搬家明天移孔，浪费很大。工友也埋怨领导干部和技术员不解决问题。苏联专家来了以后，他们便亲自到现场教我们：根据几次钻探的情况，再确定断层、位置、深度。现在打一个孔就有一个孔的用处了。为了帮助我们制作钻孔位置设计图，地质专家谢良吉斯基曾连熬两个通宵不睡。在苏联专家这样忠心耿耿帮助下，地质探测队技术水平都提高了，技术员吴文海已经能单独制作地图和一般竖井资料了。三○二号马文志式快速钻探小组，今年七月的工作量超过全月任务的百分之二。工程师杨廷祯说：“苏联专家再仔细也没有了，一遍不行再一遍，一点不耐烦的样子都没有，老劝我们不要灰心，常告诉说：苏联从前刚建设的时候，也像中国一样，只要肯努力，一定能成功。”技术员任逢玉说：“干了十四年测量工作，未遇到像苏联专家这样仔细的人。”
    在苏联专家的帮助下，我们克服了对工资工作的不正确看法，进行了工资改革工作。现在，在改善劳动条件、改善劳动组织，有技术定额的基础上，已有十六个场子（占全局采煤场子的百分之八十），实行了全部的“分采作计件工资”。同时，苏联专家帮助我们培养了八十余名管理工资的干部。
    苏联专家的高度负责精神，表现在对每一具体工作的周密思考上。苏联专家考然诺夫，当做好东山竖井初步设计后，便到现场拿蓝图详细对照。兴安台小鹤立河最高水位缺乏原始材料，他便亲自找当地居民打听历年涨水情况，并亲切地向我们讲解水位和井口寿命的关系。对我们准备资料不完备的地方，立即提出严肃的要求。当确定每个采区时，他都要作出几个方案，加以反复比较，其目的一是为了节约国家资源，一是提高我们的技术水准。
    苏联专家对工人的生活福利，关切得无微不至。设计工人住宅时，便考虑不要离井口太远，免得工人行走时疲劳；东北冬季多西北风，便考虑住宅不要建筑在东南方，以免工人多吸煤尘及煤烟，有害身体健康。苏联专家这种崇高的共产主义道德品质，真诚无私的友谊，实在值得我们学习。
