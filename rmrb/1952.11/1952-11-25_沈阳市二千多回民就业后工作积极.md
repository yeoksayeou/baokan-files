    More Than Two Thousand Hui People in Shenyang Become Employed and Work Actively
    Editor: With the care and help of the Shenyang Municipal People's Government, two thousand two hundred and thirteen unemployed Hui people in Shenyang have happily found employment. After being employed, each of them can earn between 7 and 15 or 16 points per day. Calculated at an average of 8 points per person, each person can earn more than 500,000 yuan per month. They can buy 180,000 catties of sorghum rice and 14,150 bags of white flour, enough to solve the living problems of more than 9,000 people. Yang Haitao, who was introduced to work in a certain machinery factory, said, "During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, no one treated us poor Hui people as human beings. At that time, I herded cattle for the landlord, and I was beaten and scolded every day. I couldn't even get a pair of shoes all year round. It's different after liberation. Not only are we politically equal to other nationalities, but the People's Government also takes great care of us in our lives. Recently, they introduced me to a job. Chairman Mao is even closer to me than my own parents." Zhang Qingtao and Tie Lianbi, who were introduced to work in a certain factory, said, "We didn't even have a place to eat or sleep in the past. Now that we have entered the factory, the factory has prepared new dining halls and dormitories for us. In order to take care of our ethnic minorities, they also bought new cooking utensils, bowls, chopsticks, and so on for us. Compared with the past, this is a world of difference." In order to repay Chairman Mao, they work very actively. The 165 Hui veteran workers who participated in the No. 1 Kiln Factory completed their production tasks ahead of schedule in September and were praised by the factory. More than 300 Hui workers who participated in the river channel renovation project in the urban area worked even harder. Among them, the Feng Jingzhe group created the advanced working method of "staggered flow method" in the river excavation project, which promoted the work of the entire work area and was rewarded by the leadership. After these two thousand unemployed Hui people were employed, not only did their lives improve, but their understanding also improved. They are actively requesting to study. Some have already participated in the Party training class in their units.

    沈阳市二千多回民就业后工作积极
    编辑同志：沈阳市二千二百十三名失业回民，在市人民政府的关怀和帮助下，愉快地就业了。就业后，他们每人每日可以收入七分至十五、六分，平均每人按八分计算，每月每人可收入五十多万元。他们可以买高粱米十八万斤、白面一万四千一百五十袋，足够解决九千多人的生活问题。被介绍到某机械工厂做工的杨海涛说：“在国民党反动派统治时期，没有人把咱们穷回民当人。那时，我给地主放牛，每天挨打受骂，一年到头连一双鞋也混不上。解放后可不一样了，我们不但在政治上和别的民族一样，而且在生活上，人民政府也对我们照顾得非常周到。最近又给我介绍了工作。毛主席可真比我的爹娘还亲。”被介绍到某工厂工作的张清涛、铁连壁说：“我们过去就没有一个吃饭、睡觉的地方。现在进了工厂，厂方给我们准备了新的饭堂和宿舍。为了照顾咱们少数民族，还给咱们买了新的炊具、碗筷等等。这和过去比，可真是天大的分别。”他们为了报答毛主席，工作很积极。参加窑业一厂的一百六十五名回民老工人，九月份提前完成了生产任务，受到厂方的表扬。参加改建市区河道工程的三百多名回民工人，干的劲头更大。其中冯景哲小组，在挖河工程中，创造了“垒次流水法”的先进工作法，因而推动了全工区的工作，受到领导上的奖励。这二千多失业回民劳动就业后，不仅生活改善了，且认识也提高了。他们正积极要求学习。有的已参加了本单位的党训班学习。
