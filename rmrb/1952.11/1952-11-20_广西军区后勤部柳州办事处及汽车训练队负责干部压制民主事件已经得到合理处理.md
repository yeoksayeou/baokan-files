Correctly Treat Criticism and Self-Criticism

    Logistics Department of the Guangxi Military Region, Liuzhou Office and Automobile Training Team

    Responsible Cadres' Suppression of Democracy Has Been Handled Reasonably

    Comrades Editor: We informed you in July of the initial handling of the issue of Yu Haishen, Liu Yusheng, and other comrades exposing the extravagance and waste of Zhao Deming, the political instructor of the Automobile Training Team of the Liuzhou Office of the Logistics Department of the Guangxi Military Region, and the suppression of democracy by leading cadres of the Liuzhou Office and the Automobile Training Team of the Military Region's Logistics Department (the details of this incident were published on the "Reader's Letters" page on July 23). On September 27, we specifically convened a meeting of the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Military Region Party Committee, inviting Yu Haishen and Liu Yusheng to participate, and inviting comrades from the Guangxi Daily to attend, to further handle this matter. At the meeting, Lu Hua, the Second Deputy Political Commissar of the Logistics Department and Political Commissar of the Liuzhou Office, and Yu Bo, the Deputy Minister of the Logistics Department, who were criticized, made self-criticisms of their mistakes. The Discipline Inspection Committee of the Military Region Party Committee made a summary. All attendees, including Yu Haishen and Liu Yusheng, unanimously agreed with this summary.

    We had shortcomings in handling this matter in the past. We received the complaint materials from Yu Haishen and others in mid-March of this year, but we delayed the initial handling for three months. In the initial handling, we did not follow the spirit of the Party Central Committee's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications," educating the criticized to make public self-criticisms of the correct parts of the complaints, and to make statements of fact regarding the inaccurate parts of the criticisms in a realistic manner. We also did not make a clear and affirmative conclusion on the error of suppressing criticism by the leading cadres of the Liuzhou Office and the Automobile Training Team. Afterwards, we did not adequately explain to and solicit opinions from comrades like Yu Haishen, but thought that the problem was solved after both sides had made self-criticisms and the materials were reported. All of this shows that we were not serious and responsible enough in handling this matter in the past.

    The Party Committee of the Military Region's Logistics Department also had the same shortcomings in dealing with this issue. After receiving the materials forwarded by the higher-level Party Committee, they did not conduct a thorough investigation, analyze and study the nature of the case, or propose specific and appropriate solutions, but instead forwarded the materials to the accused unit, the Party Committee of the Liuzhou Office. This approach was unserious and irresponsible.

    The leading cadres of the Party Committee of the Liuzhou Office and the Automobile Training Team, however, adopted erroneous means of suppressing criticism regarding the incident of Yu Haishen and other comrades' complaints against leading cadres. Zhao Deming, the political instructor of the Automobile Training Team of the Liuzhou Office, although did not engage in major corruption, did have improper behavior such as improper expenditures and taking petty advantages of public property. He lacked a democratic work style on weekdays, did not delve deeply into his work, and showed a lack of principle on certain issues. The complaints made by Yu Haishen and other comrades correctly pointed out these problems, although there were exaggerations and inaccuracies. In handling this incident, the leadership of the Party Committee of the Liuzhou Office and the Automobile Training Team one-sidedly emphasized the part of Yu Haishen's complaints that did not conform to the facts, and therefore erroneously attempted to use handwriting comparison to track down the names of the anonymous complainants, and convened meetings to use mass pressure to force Yu Haishen and others to make self-criticisms, and also transferred Yu Haishen away from his work. They did not examine their own shortcomings and mistakes regarding the correct parts of the complaints. At the same time, because they had not studied the Party Central Committee's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications" sufficiently, and lacked a correct understanding of criticism and self-criticism, they erroneously believed that: "Yu Haishen and others' reflection of the situation to the Party newspaper without review by the leading comrades and the organization is an act of disorganization and indiscipline." "The situation reflected by Yu Haishen and others to the People's Daily has distortions of the facts, and the newspaper should not support their complaints." Thus, they adopted a passive and indifferent attitude towards the criticism from the Party newspaper, which led to the delay in resolving this incident until now.

    It should be affirmed that the actions of Yu Haishen, Liu Yusheng, and other comrades in reflecting opinions and lodging complaints to the People's Daily are legitimate and are the rights that Party members should have. Some of the opinions and issues they raised are in accordance with the facts. Regarding criticisms of this nature, we should, as pointed out in the Party Central Committee's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications," "adopt a revolutionary attitude of warm welcome and resolute protection." As for the inaccuracies in the complainants' complaints, the leaders should patiently explain and enlighten them to consciously conduct self-criticism and correction. Any impatience or rude attitude is wrong. The People's Daily and the higher-level Party Committee have repeatedly ordered us to handle the issues complained of by Yu Haishen and others, and have criticized our improper handling. These practices are correct. We should learn from the spirit and practice of the Party newspaper and the higher-level Party Committee in valuing the opinions of the masses and closely connecting the Party with the broad masses.

    We have made the following handling of this incident: (1) Ordered Yu Bo, Lu Hua, Zhao Deming, and other comrades involved in this case to make public self-criticisms of their personal corruption, waste, bureaucratism, and mistakes in suppressing criticism. (2) If there are any aspects of the historical organizational conclusions of Yu Haishen and others that do not conform to the actual situation, the Party Committee of the Military Region's Logistics Department is instructed to make correct revisions.

    From this incident, we further understand that the Party Committee of the Military Region's Logistics Department and the Liuzhou Office still have a bureaucratic style of leadership in their work style; individual cadres still lack a democratic work style, and even adopt erroneous means of attacking and retaliating against criticism from below. These are very bad for the development of the troops' work and the unity of the troops. In the future, the Party Committee of the Military Region's Logistics Department should strengthen the study of the Party Constitution and Party policies, fully promote democracy, and correctly treat the criticism of the masses. Any erroneous attitude of ignoring or even suppressing and retaliating against criticism must be immediately corrected.

### 广西军区后勤部柳州办事处及汽车训练队负责干部压制民主事件已经得到合理处理

专栏：正确地对待批评和自我批评

    广西军区后勤部柳州办事处及汽车训练队
    负责干部压制民主事件已经得到合理处理
    编辑同志：于海深、刘玉声等同志揭发广西军区后勤部柳州办事处汽车训练队政治协理员赵德明等铺张浪费以及军区后勤部柳州办事处及汽车训练队领导干部压制民主的问题（这一事件的经过刊七月二十三日“读者来信专页”），我们曾在七月把初步处理结果告诉你们。九月二十七日，我们又专门召开了军区党委纪律检查委员会，吸收了于海深、刘玉声两同志参加，并邀请广西日报社派同志出席，对这件事作进一步处理。会上，被批评者后勤部第二副政治委员兼柳州办事处政治委员陆华同志、后勤部副部长于博同志对自己的错误作了检讨，军区党委纪律检查委员会作了总结；到会人员及于海深、刘玉声等同志对此总结一致表示同意。
    我们过去在处理这一事件时是有缺点的。我们在今年三月中旬就接到于海深等控告材料，但拖延了三个月之久才作初步处理。而在初步处理时，我们没有按照党中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”的精神，教育被批评者对控告中正确的部分作公开检讨，对批评失实部分以实事求是的态度提出申明；我们也没有对柳州办事处及汽车训练队领导干部压制批评的错误作出明确肯定的结论。事后，也没有很好地向于海深等同志进行解释和征求意见；而认为双方都作了检讨，材料上报后就解决了问题。这些，都说明我们过去在处理这个事件时是不够严肃负责的。
    军区后勤部党委对待这个问题也有同样的缺点。他们接到上级党委转去的材料，没有切实进行调查、分析研究案件的性质，提出具体妥善的解决办法，却把材料转给被控告单位柳州办事处党委了。这种做法是不严肃、不负责的。
    柳州办事处党委及汽车训练队领导干部，却对于海深等同志控告领导干部的事件，采取了压制批评的错误手段。柳州办事处汽车训练队政治协理员赵德明同志，虽没有大的贪污行为，但也有开支不当、占公家小便宜等不正当的行为。他平日缺乏民主作风，工作不深入，在某些问题上表现了原则性差。于海深等同志的控告中正确地指出了这些问题，当然也有夸大失实的地方。柳州办事处党委和汽车训练队领导方面在处理这个事件中，片面地强调了于海深等控告中与事实不符的一部分，因而错误地要用对照笔迹的方法来追查匿名控告者的姓名，并召开会议用群众压力来逼迫于海深等作反省检讨，还把于海深调离工作；他们对控告中的正确部分，却并不检讨自己的缺点和错误。同时，因为他们对党中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”学习不够，对批评与自我批评缺乏正确认识，错误地认为：“于海深等向党报反映情况未经领导同志和组织审查，是无组织无纪律的行为。”“于海深等向人民日报反映的情况有歪曲事实的地方，报社不该支持他们的控告。”这样，他们就对党报的批评抱着消极不理的态度，以致这个事件拖到现在才解决。
    应该肯定：于海深、刘玉声等同志向人民日报反映意见、提出控告的行动是正当的，是党员应有的权利。他们所反映的意见和提到的问题，有一部分是合乎事实的。对于这种性质的批评，我们应该像党中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”中所指出的，应该“采取热烈欢迎和坚决保护的革命态度”。至于批评者控告中有失实的地方，领导者应该耐心地进行解释，启发他们自觉地进行检讨和更正；任何急躁情绪和粗暴态度都是不对的。人民日报和上级党委对于海深等所控告的问题，历次责成我们进行处理，并对我们处理不当之处提出批评。这些做法都是正确的。我们应该学习党报和上级党委重视群众意见、密切党与广大群众联系的精神和做法。
    对于这个事件，我们作了如下处理：（一）责成此案件有关人员于博、陆华、赵德明等同志，对个人的贪污浪费、官僚主义及压制批评的错误作公开检讨。（二）对于海深等的历史组织结论，如有不符合实际情况之处，责成军区后勤党委作正确的修正。
    从这个事件中，我们进一步了解了军区后勤部及柳州办事处党委在领导作风上还有着官僚主义作风；个别干部还缺乏民主作风，甚至对来自下面的批评采取打击报复的错误手段。这些对部队工作的开展和部队的团结都是很不好的。今后，军区后勤部党委应加强党章和党的政策学习，充分发扬民主，正确地对待群众的批评。任何对批评采取置之不理、甚至压制报复的错误态度，都必须立即纠正。
