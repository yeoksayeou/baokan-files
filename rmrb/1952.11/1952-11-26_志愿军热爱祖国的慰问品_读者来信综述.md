    Volunteer Soldiers' Love for the Fatherland's Comfort Gifts
    —A Summary of Readers' Letters

    Volunteer soldiers who received the comfort gifts brought to Korea by the Second Delegation to Comfort the Korean People have written letters to the people of the motherland, excitedly recounting how they love the precious gifts from the motherland.

    Jia Hongwen and Ren Shouzheng of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army wrote in a letter to the people of the whole country: Every item you sent has become a "priceless treasure" in our hands. Even a piece of stationery or an envelope, the comrades look at it over and over again, muttering: This is sent by the people of the motherland, it is a precious gift! Many comrades wrap these gifts, especially Chairman Mao's portrait, in several layers of paper, and put them together with their medals and other most beloved things. Some even sew a cloth cover to put the teacup in to prevent it from being damaged. Comrade Gao Liankui, holding a beautiful souvenir album, said: "I will keep it carefully. When I capture American prisoners and make contributions, I will record it on it and send it to Chairman Mao!"

    Comrade Zhou Chuan's letter vividly narrates how the soldiers of the tenth squad of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army welcomed the comfort items from the motherland. The letter says: When squad leader Zhu Decai went to collect the comfort items, the soldiers began to decorate the small meeting place. The tables were wiped clean, and the floor was swept again. Everyone took out the musical instruments they made, such as the huqin and "piano," and played and sang, laughing in a group. After a while, the squad leader came back carrying the comfort items, and the soldiers surrounded him, took out all kinds of comfort items, and arranged them neatly on the table. Chairman Mao's portrait was placed on the left side of the table, and the rest were placed on the right. Squad leader Zhu Decai gave the order. The first time was: "Salute to the great leader Chairman Mao!" After the salute, he distributed the portraits to everyone, each with one. Then it was: "Pay tribute to the dear people of the motherland!" After the salute, everyone received many precious gifts. The soldiers were very excited. Yan Ancai, looking at Chairman Mao's portrait, said: "Chairman Mao, you don't have time to come and see us in person, so you sent the portrait. You care about me even more than my father!"

    Gao Yujie of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army wrote in a letter to the editorial department of this newspaper: We had a very meaningful second anniversary of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea this year. Because on the eve of that day, everyone received comfort gifts from the motherland. Everyone received a beautifully made enamel cup, a carton of cigarettes, a souvenir album, a silk handkerchief, a comfort bag, a pound of fruit candy, and a portrait of Chairman Mao. The comrades' faces were filled with smiles when they received the gifts. Lu Shixing, who was about to leave for a mission, said while wiping his gun and tidying up his grenades: "Tonight I must capture more prisoners to thank the people of the motherland for their concern!"

    Young Volunteer Air Force soldiers, Volunteer comrades who have just learned to write letters, and female medical workers in the war zone have all written letters to report to the people of the motherland how they love the gifts from the motherland and express their determination to resist US aggression and aid Korea. On the same day that a certain company of the Volunteer Army received the comfort gifts, it received more than sixty letters of determination from the soldiers, expressing their strong will.

    志愿军热爱祖国的慰问品
    ——读者来信综述
    收到第二届赴朝慰问团带到朝鲜的慰问品的志愿军同志们，纷纷给祖国人民写信，兴奋地述说着自己如何热爱祖国珍贵礼品的故事。
    志愿军某部贾鸿文、任守正在写给全国人民的信上说：你们送来的每一件东西，在我们手里都成了“无价之宝”。就是一张信纸、一个信封，同志们都反复地看来看去，嘴里叨念着：这是祖国人民送来的呀，是珍贵的礼品呀！许多同志都把这些礼品，特别是毛主席的像片包上好几层纸，和自己的纪念章、奖章等最可爱的东西放在一块，有的还缝了一个布套，把茶杯装在里边，以免碰坏。高连奎同志拿着一本漂亮的纪念册说：“我要把它好好保存起来。等到抓来美国俘虏，立了功，把它记载在上面，送给毛主席！”
    周川同志的来信里，生动地叙述着志愿军某部十班战士如何迎接祖国的慰问物品。信中说：班长朱德财去领慰问品时，战士们就开始布置小会场。桌子揩得干干净净，地也重新扫了一遍。大家把自己制造的胡琴、“钢琴”等乐器一齐拿出来，弹啊，唱啊，欢笑成一团。一会，班长扛着慰问品回来了，战士们围上去，把各种慰问品拿出来，整整齐齐地摆在桌子上。毛主席像片放在桌子的左边，其余放在右边。班长朱德财发出口令。头一次是：“向伟大的领袖毛主席敬礼！”礼毕后，他把像片分给大家，每人都有一张。接着是：“向亲爱的祖国人民致敬！”礼毕后，每人又分到了许多珍贵的礼品。战士们都很兴奋。严安财看着毛主席的像片说：“毛主席啊，你没有功夫亲自来看我们，就把像片送来了。你真比我的父亲还关怀我！”
    志愿军某部高玉阶在给本报编辑部的信上写着：今年的抗美援朝两周年纪念日，我们过得很有意义。因为在那天的前夕，大家都收到了祖国的慰问品。每人都得到精制的搪瓷杯一只、香烟一条、纪念册一本、丝制手绢一条、慰问袋一个、水果糖一斤，还有毛主席的像片。同志们拿到礼物后，脸上都浮现着笑容。立刻要出发执行任务的卢世兴，一面擦枪、整理手榴弹，一面说：“今晚我一定要多抓几个俘虏，来答谢祖国人民的关怀！”
    年轻的志愿军空军战士、刚学会写信的志愿军同志们，以及战地的女医务工作人员，都纷纷写信向祖国人民报告个人或所在单位如何热爱着祖国的礼品，并表示抗美援朝的决心。志愿军某连队在收到慰问品的当天，就接到战士们六十多封决心书，表示自己的坚强意志。
