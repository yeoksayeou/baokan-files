    Cannot Relax Vigilance Against Counter-Revolutionaries
    Editor: Recently, in Longtan Township, Ninth District, Lianyuan County, Hunan Province, an incident occurred in which counter-revolutionaries murdered the township chief. Peng Fuchu, the township chief of Longtan Township, was a member of the Communist Youth League and consistently worked actively. On September 12th this year, a counter-revolutionary element, Huang Donglin, came to the township people's government to request a travel permit. Peng Fuchu, seeing that Huang Donglin had ulterior motives, resolutely refused to grant it. Suddenly, Huang Donglin raised a steelyard weight and struck Peng Fuchu on the head, then drew a dagger he was carrying and stabbed Peng Fuchu twice, ultimately killing him. Due to a lack of vigilance, Wang Baofu, the township farmers' association chairman, and Li Jianxiong, the deputy secretary of the Communist Youth League branch, who were present, were unable to help and were also almost killed. Hearing the cries for help, hundreds of militiamen and civilians from the township rushed to the scene and, after a struggle, captured Huang Donglin and handed him over to the higher-level people's government for punishment.
    The people of all regions should learn a lesson from this incident, immediately heighten their vigilance, and do a good job in controlling counter-revolutionary elements.

    不能放松对反革命分子的警惕
    编辑同志：湖南省涟源县九区龙潭乡最近发生了反革命分子杀害乡长的事件。龙潭乡乡长彭福初，是青年团员，一向工作积极。今年九月十二日，反革命分子黄东林来该乡人民政府要求开通行证。彭福初看黄东林心怀不轨，坚决不给开。突然间，黄东林竟举起一秤锤向彭福初头上打去，并抽出所带凶刀向彭福初刺杀两刀，终将彭福初杀死了。因为疏于警惕，在场的乡农会主席王保富、青年团支部副书记李健雄未能搭救，且也几乎遭了毒手。在呼救声中，乡中民兵和群众数百人赶到，经过搏斗才把黄东林捕获，送上级人民政府惩办。
    各地人民应该接受这一事件的教训，立即提高警惕，做好管制反革命分子的工作。
