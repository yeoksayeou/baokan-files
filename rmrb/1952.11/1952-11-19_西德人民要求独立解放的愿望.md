    The Wish of the People of West Germany for Independence and Liberation
    At a time when the German people's movement for peace, unification, and independence is rapidly developing, the German Communist Party has published a program for restoring the unity of all Germany, calling on all patriotic people to unite within the National Front of Democratic Germany and to strive for the goal of realizing the national liberation struggle of West Germany. This militant action program not only expresses the urgent demands of the West German people for national unity and national independence, but also points out the path for the West German people to strive for national liberation.
    Restoring peace and unity in Germany is the unanimous desire of all German people. The Soviet Union's peace policy and Democratic Germany's active efforts have provided the possibility for a peaceful resolution of the German question and the establishment of a unified, democratic, peaceful, and independent Germany. However, the United States, Britain, France, and their Bonn puppets are pursuing a policy of creating war and dividing Germany, doing their utmost to obstruct the unification of East and West Germany, intensifying the remilitarization of West Germany, and imposing the so-called "General Treaty" on the West German people in order to permanently occupy West Germany and establish a rule of enslavement over the West German people. The West German people have thus fallen into dire straits. Now, the United States and the Adenauer government are intensifying pressure, forcing the Bonn Bundestag to ratify the "General Treaty" and the "European Defense Community Treaty," which divide Germany and prepare for war, and accelerating the establishment of German mercenary forces. Therefore, the primary issue facing the West German people today is to get rid of foreign enslavement, because only in this way can they survive and avoid destruction.
    The goal of the West German national liberation struggle put forward in the German Communist Party's program is entirely in line with the interests of the German people, because every German person wants to live a happy life of independence, peace, democracy, and freedom. And facts have proven that democratic freedom, economic prosperity, cultural development, and improved living standards can only be achieved in a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving country. The Adenauer group's traitorous policy will only drive the West German people into the abyss of war and disaster. Therefore, people from all walks of life in West Germany must unite in a broad patriotic movement to strive for these goals.
    The Adenauer group's die-hard implementation of a traitorous policy that betrays national interests has become the main obstacle to the West German people's struggle for national liberation. Therefore, overthrowing the Adenauer regime and establishing a government that truly represents the interests of the people is the unanimous demand of all German people. Only in this way can West Germany and East Germany quickly reach an agreement, hold free all-German elections as soon as possible, and establish a National Assembly, so that the joint action of the entire German people can strive for the realization of peace and unification. We can believe that the German Communist Party's program will surely win the support and response of the West German and all German people.
    The National Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany has issued a statement supporting the German Communist Party's program for restoring the unity of all Germany. The resolutions of the recent International Conference for a Peaceful Solution to the German Question held in Berlin expressed the concern of people from all countries for a peaceful solution to the German question. The West German people's struggle for national liberation and national unification will surely receive the firm support of peace-loving people all over the world.

### 西德人民要求独立解放的愿望

    西德人民要求独立解放的愿望
    在德国人民争取和平、统一与独立的运动正在迅速向前发展的时候，德国共产党发表了一项争取恢复全德统一的纲领，号召全体爱国人民团结在民主德国全国阵线之内，为实现西德民族解放斗争的目标而奋斗。这个战斗性的行动纲领，不仅表达了西德人民对于国家统一与民族独立的迫切要求，同时给西德人民指出了争取民族解放斗争的道路。
    恢复德国的和平与统一是全体德国人民的一致愿望。苏联的和平政策和民主德国的积极努力，已给和平解决德国问题和建立一个统一、民主、和平、独立的德国提供了可能性。但是美、英、法及其波恩傀儡却执行着制造战争和分裂德国的政策，极力阻挠东德和西德的统一，加紧进行西德的重新军国主义化，并将所谓“一般性条约”强加在西德人民身上，以便永久占领西德，建立对西德人民的奴役统治。西德人民已因此而陷入水深火热之中。现在美国和阿登纳政府正在加强压力，迫使波恩联邦议会批准分裂德国和准备战争的“一般性条约”与“欧洲防御集团条约”，加速建立德国雇佣军。因此，今天摆在西德人民面前的首要问题是摆脱外国的奴役统治，因为只有这样才能够生存，才能够免于毁灭。
    德共纲领所提出的西德民族解放斗争的目标，是完全符合德国人民的利益的，因为每一个德国人民都愿意过独立、和平、民主和自由的幸福生活。而事实证明民主自由、经济繁荣、文化发展和生活改善，只有在一个统一、独立、民主与爱好和平的国家中才能得到。阿登纳集团的卖国政策只会把西德人民驱向战争和灾难的深渊。因此西德各阶层人民必须团结在一个广泛的爱国运动之中，为实现这些目标而奋斗。
    阿登纳集团死心塌地执行出卖民族利益的卖国政策，已成为西德人民争取民族解放的主要障碍。所以推翻阿登纳政权，建立一个真正代表人民利益的政府，已是全体德国人民的一致要求。只有这样才能使西德与东德之间迅速达成协议，早日举行全德自由选举，成立国民议会，以全德人民的联合行动来争取和平与统一的实现。我们可以相信，德国共产党的纲领必将获得西德和全德国人民的拥护和响应。
    民主德国全国阵线全国委员会已发表声明，支持德国共产党所提出的争取恢复德国全国统一的纲领。最近在柏林举行的国际争取和平解决德国问题会议的决议，表达了各国人民对和平解决德国问题的关切。西德人民争取民族解放和国家统一的斗争必将受到全世界爱好和平的人民的坚决支持。
