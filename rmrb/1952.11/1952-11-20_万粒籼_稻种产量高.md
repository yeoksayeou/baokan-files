    "Wan Li Xian" Rice Seed Has High Yield
    Comrade Editor: I am from Jinfeng Township, Sixth District, Wangcheng, Hunan. Of the 290 farmers in our township, only Wen Meiting planted the "Wan Li Xian" rice seed last year. In March of this year, Comrade Zhong Zenshi of the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry came to the district to promote "Wan Li Xian." He lent our township 1,750 jin of rice seeds, and more than 60 households planted them. This autumn harvest proved that the yield of "Wan Li Xian" is very high.
    Last year, I didn't believe that "Wan Li Xian" was good either, only hearing others say: "Wan Li Xian needs more fertilizer and is harvested late." In March of this year, the district convened a production meeting, and Comrade Zhong from the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry promoted to us: "Wan Li Xian is willing to sprout, and the grains are tightly packed; the stalks are thick and strong and not easy to lodge; the leaves grow upwards, even if the stalks fall, the leaves covering the grains will not easily sprout; the glumes are long and can prevent rice stem borers; drought resistance is also stronger than ordinary rice seeds; the grains are large, heavy, and yield more than ordinary rice seeds." I made up my mind to get "Wan Li Xian" seeds from the district people's government, first planting all my ten mu of land with "Wan Li Xian", and then mobilizing the whole group to take the lead in planting. Of the group's 48.2 mu of land, 33.5 mu were planted with "Wan Li Xian." The result of the harvest was: the 33.5 mu of "Wan Li Xian" yielded an average of 724 jin per mu, while the fields planted with ordinary rice seeds yielded an average of only 600 jin per mu.

    “万粒籼”稻种产量高
    编辑同志：我是湖南望城六区金峰乡人。我们全乡共有二百九十家农民，去年只有文美庭一家种了“万粒籼”谷种。今年三月，省农林厅钟震世同志来到区上推广“万粒籼”。他给我乡贷发了一千七百五十斤稻种，全乡有六十多家种上了。今年秋收的时候，证明“万粒籼”的收成非常大。
    去年我也不相信“万粒籼”好，只听别人说：“万粒籼下粪多收割晚”。今年三月区上召开生产会议，省农林厅钟同志向我们宣传说：“万粒籼肯发?，粒子结得密；杆子粗壮不易倒伏；叶子朝上长，就是禾秆倒了，叶子遮住谷子也不容易生芽；苞叶长可以防稻苞虫；抗旱能力也比一般的稻种强；颗粒大，分量重，比一般稻种收得多。”我下决心向区人民政府领了“万粒籼”种，先把自己的十亩田全种上“万粒籼”，又发动全组带头种。全组四十八亩二分田，有三十三亩五分田是种的“万粒籼”。收获的结果是：种“万粒籼”的三十三亩五分田平均每亩收七百二十四斤，种一般稻种的田平均每亩只收六百斤。
