Economic Learning and Technical Education
——An Introduction to the Advanced Experience of the China Changchun Railway, Part Seven
Li Mingzhe, Vice Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the China Changchun Railway Company

    For more than two years, under the enthusiastic guidance of Soviet experts, the China Changchun Railway has not only become a model railway for the whole country but also the best school for cultivating Chinese railway cadres. Most of our original cadres were transferred from other departments. They were rarely familiar with railway operations and lacked experience in railway management. We had few technical personnel, and even those who possessed some technical knowledge lacked the ideology of serving the people. Some technical personnel were content with the old technology and standards of American, British, and Japanese capitalism, and they neglected the advanced experience of socialism. Our working masses had long been in a position of oppression, lacking education and skilled technical knowledge. This situation shows that training cadres has become the primary and serious problem in our work.

    The Soviet experts of the China Changchun Railway often told us: Under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the liberated Chinese people have no insurmountable difficulties. Any advanced technology, as long as we study it, we will certainly be able to learn it. Soviet experts also told us: "Our task is to teach Chinese comrades everything we know." For more than two years, Soviet experts have used this spirit of internationalism to cultivate a large number of cadres who can master Soviet experience.

    As soon as the China Changchun Railway was established, Soviet experts first proposed and helped us to set up schools and training classes, and to establish various organizations for learning advanced experience. In order to improve the leadership ability of leading cadres and the business level of railway management, the Administration, branch bureaus, railway factories, and large stations and sections have established various levels of spare-time study classes for cadres. Soviet experts from various departments served as teachers. Those who participated in the study included Comrade Yu Guangsheng, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the China Changchun Railway Company, and leaders of Party committees, administrations, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League at all levels. The content of the study included: the preparation of production and financial plans, the regulations of the economic accounting system, various professional knowledge, and advanced experience. Currently, more than 1,000 cadres throughout the railway are studying in this study class, and with the exception of a few areas, this study has never been interrupted throughout the railway.

    In order to systematically train professional cadres, Soviet experts suggested that three technical schools be established in Harbin, Changchun, and Dalian successively from 1950 (in 1952, the Changchun Technical School was merged into the Dalian Technical School based on specific circumstances). These schools have specific divisions of labor: Dalian Technical School focuses on training personnel in locomotive and rolling stock; Changchun Technical School focuses on training personnel in train operations; Harbin is the location of the leading organ of the China Changchun Railway, and there are more Soviet experts, so the Harbin Technical School focuses on training leading cadres in engineering, telecommunications, finance, and planning. The China Changchun Railway also frequently uses various methods to train technical personnel, such as holding various short-term training classes and advanced method training classes, convening demonstration conferences of advanced workers, and adopting the method of masters leading apprentices. These methods have all achieved great results. In more than two years, 35,061 cadres have been trained, not including the number of people studying in various spare-time classes.

    In addition, 61 technical research offices have been established throughout the railway, and employees are regularly organized to study advanced working methods. A technology museum has been established in the Administration to specifically promote advanced Soviet experience. “Propaganda trains” are sent to various places to publicize advanced working methods. Through learning organizations, discussions, reports, research, exhibitions and other forms are used to promote more than 130 kinds of advanced working methods. The technology museum has printed and distributed more than 60,000 copies of study reference booklets on advanced working methods. Through these studies, the China Changchun Railway has produced a large number of model workers and excellent cadres. They are not only able to independently competent their work, but also able to give lectures to others. Sun Bo, a graduate of the accounting class of the technical school, is now an accounting teacher at the school. The advanced loading method of Yang Maolin, a trainee in the weigher training class, has been promoted throughout the country. Li Xikui learned advanced Soviet experience and created a new shunting method. Zheng Xikun learned from Soviet experience and became a standard bearer for exceeding axle loads. Under the cultivation of Soviet experts, Wang Jikui and Qiao Yuyan pioneered a new record of 500 kilometers per day per train. Guo Chunlin learned and developed Nefedov's track maintenance method. Bai Xiaosheng took the lead in implementing the fast assembly line method of freight car repair. Zhang Diankui learned the Sudenikov scheduling method.

    Due to the study of advanced Soviet experience, various work indicators of the China Changchun Railway have been significantly improved. The per capita production plan for 1952 increased by 55.2% compared to 1951, and 25.2% compared to the actual completion in 1951. In September 1952, the daily train kilometerage of locomotives throughout the railway reached 522.1 kilometers. The quality of the line has increased sevenfold. The China Changchun Railway has overfulfilled its transportation tasks and obtained great profits for several years. The China Changchun Railway has continuously won the Central People's Government Ministry of Railways' circulating winner flag for four months.

    With the help of Soviet experts, the China Changchun Railway has established a complete cadre training organization: the Administration has a Culture and Education Department, the branch bureaus have Culture and Education Sections, and large stations and sections have full-time education engineers; smaller units also have part-time education engineers. Soviet experts have also helped us to formulate education plans, management systems, and various learning systems, which have played a decisive role in the training of cadres.

    Comrade Yelogov, Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of the China Changchun Railway Company, Comrade Grunichev, Director of the Administration, and every Soviet expert, serve as teachers, and they enthusiastically give us lectures; they also select the best experts to serve as our teachers for a long time. Comrade Gorerov, Supervisor of the Supervisory Board, is very busy with his work, but he also regularly serves as an accounting teacher at the Harbin Technical School. 180 accounting personnel have been trained by him, of which 107 have served as chief accountants, and some have become accounting teachers. Comrades Singov and Meligov gave us lectures while sick. In order to train Chinese cadres in practical work, Soviet experts also signed master-apprentice contracts with relevant cadres. Feng Jiguo, head of the Boketu Engineering Section, helped Wang Laibao to study, not sleeping for several nights. Wang Laibao was a track maintenance worker with a very low level of education and could not speak Russian. Comrade Feng Jiguo tried every means to teach Wang Laibao using pictures and gestures. Wang Laibao finally became the head of an engineering section who had mastered advanced experience. In addition, Comrade Maligiyanov cultivated driver Wang Jikui to become the founder of the 500-kilometer movement; Comrade Kravich cultivated Yang Maolin to become a model worker of the new loading method. The courses taught by Soviet experts are all compiled into lecture notes. Comrade Tuo Wanchuk, Director of the Board of Directors of the China Changchun Railway Company, lectured at the China Changchun Railway and took time to lecture at the Harbin Railway Institute. After receiving the notice to return to his country, he rushed to write lecture notes day and night. Before leaving, he handed over the complete lecture notes to the responsible comrades of the Railway Institute. What a great friendship!

    The experience we have learned over the past two years proves that the help of the great Soviet Union is sincere and selfless, and the Soviet Union's science and technology are the most advanced in the world. As long as we can earnestly learn from advanced Soviet experience, we can improve our business capabilities and manage the people's railway well. The facts of the China Changchun Railway also prove that whichever unit learns from the Soviet Union with an open mind, that unit's work will have achievements and development; whichever unit does not learn from the Soviet Union with an open mind, that unit's work will be difficult to achieve results and will have shortcomings and errors.

    经济学习与技术教育
    ——中国长春铁路先进经验介绍之七
    中国长春铁路公司监事会副主席　李明哲
    两年多来，在苏联专家热情的教导下，中长铁路不但成了全国的模范的铁路，而且成了培养中国铁路干部的最好的学校。我们原有的干部大都是从其它部门调来的。他们很少熟悉铁路业务，缺乏管理铁路的经验。我们的技术人员很少，纵然有少数人掌握一些技术知识，但还没有具备为人民服务的思想；有些技术人员还满足于美、英、日资本主义的旧技术、旧标准，忽视社会主义的先进经验。我们的工人群众长期处于被压迫的地位，没有文化，没有熟练的技术知识等。这种情况，说明培养干部成为我们工作中首要的严重的问题。
    中长铁路苏联专家常常告诉我们：在毛泽东主席领导下，获得了解放的中国人民，是没有克服不了的困难的。任何先进技术，只要我们学习，就一定能学会。苏联专家们又告诉我们：“我们的任务就是把我们知道的一切全部教给中国同志。”两年多来，苏联专家用这种国际主义的精神，为我们培养了大批能掌握苏联经验的干部。
    中长铁路一成立，苏联专家就首先倡议并帮助我们开办学校和训练班，建立各种各样学习先进经验的组织。为提高领导干部的领导能力和管理铁路的业务水平，管理局、分局、铁路工厂和大的站、段都建立了各级干部的业余学习班。由各部门苏联专家担任教师。参加学习的人员有中国长春铁路公司理事会主席余光生同志和各级党委、行政、工会、青年团的领导人员，学习内容为：生产财务计划的编制，经济核算制的条例，各种专业知识和先进经验。现在全路有一千多干部在这个学习班学习，除个别地区外，全路从未间断过这项学习。
    为了有计划地培养专业干部，苏联专家提议从一九五○年起，先后在哈尔滨、长春和大连建立了三所技术学校（一九五二年根据具体情况，已将长春技术学校合并于大连技术学校）。这些学校有专门的分工：大连技术学校着重培养机务和车辆方面的人材；长春技术学校着重培养车务方面的人材；哈尔滨是中长铁路领导机关所在地，苏联专家较多，所以哈尔滨技术学校着重培养工务、电务、财经计划等方面的领导干部。中长铁路还经常采用各种方法训练技术人材，比如举办各种短期训练班和先进方法训练班，召开先进工作者的示范大会，采用师傅带徒弟的办法，运用这些方法，都获得极大的成果。两年多来，已培养和训练出干部三万五千零六十一人，而各种业余的学习人数尚未包括在内。
    此外全路还建立了六十一所技术研究室，经常地组织员工研究先进工作方法，在管理局，成立了一所技术馆，专门推广苏联先进经验。派出“宣传列车”到各地宣传先进工作方法，通过学习组织，利用讨论、报告、研究、展览等形式，推广了一百三十多种先进工作方法。技术馆印发了六万多本先进工作方法的学习参考小册子。经过这些学习，中长铁路已产生出大批的劳动模范和优秀的干部。他们不但能单独胜任自己的工作，并且能给别人讲课。技术学校会计班毕业的学生孙勃同志，现是该校的会计教师。司磅员训练班的学员杨茂林同志，他的先进的装车法已在全国各地推广。李锡奎学习了苏联先进经验，创造了新的调车法。郑锡坤学习了苏联经验，成为超轴的旗手。王吉奎、乔玉岩在苏联专家培养下，首创日车五百公里的新纪录。郭春林学习并发挥了聂非铎夫的养路法。白晓生首先推行了货车修理快速流水作业法。张殿魁学会了苏德尼果夫调度法。
    由于学习了苏联先进经验，中长铁路的各种工作指标都有了显著的提高，一九五二年每一个人的生产量计划，比一九五一年提高百分之五十五点二，比一九五一年实际完成的提高百分之二十五点二。一九五二年九月份全路机车日车公里达到五百二十二点一公里。线路质量提高了七倍。中长铁路几年来都超额完成了运输任务，获得很大利润。中长铁路四个月来连续获得中央人民政府铁道部循环优胜奖旗。
    在苏联专家帮助下，中长铁路建立了完整的培养干部的机构：管理局有文教处，分局有文教科，大的站、段都有专任的教育工程师；较次等的单位，也有兼职的教育工程师。苏联专家还帮助我们制定教育计划、管理制度和各种学习制度，对于培养干部起了决定的作用。
    中国长春铁路公司理事会副主席叶洛果夫同志，管理局局长格鲁尼切夫同志和每一个苏联专家，都担任教师的职务，他们热情地给我们讲课；还挑选最优秀的各种专家，长期地担任我们的教师。监事会监事果列罗夫同志的工作非常忙，但还经常地担任哈尔滨技术学校的会计教师，经过他训练出来的会计人员已有一百八十人，其中一百零七人已担任总会计的工作，有的已成为会计教员。辛果夫、梅立果夫等同志，带病给我们上课。为了在实际工作中培养中国干部，苏联专家还和有关的干部订立了师徒合同。博克图工务段长冯吉果同志帮助王来宝学习，曾几夜不睡觉。王来宝是个养路工，文化程度很低，不会讲俄语。冯吉果同志想尽了一切办法，用图画和手式等来教王来宝，王来宝终于成为一个掌握了先进经验的工务段长。此外，马利吉牙诺夫同志培养了司机王吉奎成为五百公里运动的创始人；克拉维赤同志培养了杨茂林成为新装车法的劳动模范。苏联专家讲授的课程，都编写成讲义，中国长春铁路公司理事会理事脱万楚克同志在中长铁路讲课，并抽时间为哈尔滨铁道学院讲课。在他得到回国的通知后，他昼夜赶写讲义，临走时，把完整的讲义交给铁道学院的负责同志。这是多么伟大的友谊！
    两年多来，我们学习的经验证明：伟大苏联对我们的帮助是真诚无私的，苏联的科学技术是世界上最先进的，只要我们能认真地学习苏联先进经验，就能提高我们的业务能力，就能办好人民铁路。中长铁路的事实也证明：那个单位虚心地向苏联学习，那个单位的工作就有成绩，就有发展；那个单位不虚心地向苏联学习，那个单位的工作就很难获得成绩，就会发生缺点和错误。
