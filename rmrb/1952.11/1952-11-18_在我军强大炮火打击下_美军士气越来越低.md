Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, November 17th: Our frontline reporter reports: "'Keep your head down!' is a saying circulating among American soldiers invading Korea recently. American prisoners of war say that the 'first lesson' that veterans give new recruits is 'keep your head down.'" On the front lines, American soldiers dare not easily leave their fortifications; once out of the fortifications, they are like startled rabbits, running head down and bent over along the deep communication trenches. Because they are deeply afraid of being knocked down by sudden artillery shells and bullets.

The changes on the battle line are very fast. More than half a year ago, the American invading army set up tents on the positions and often drank and danced inside. But now, our army's fierce artillery fire and accurately shot bullets have forced the American soldiers to "keep their heads down" and hide tightly in single-person trenches and bunkers, not daring to move for hours. They cannot eat hot meals, sometimes they have to go hungry all day, and even have to throw their excrement and urine into canned food boxes. A prisoner of war from the US 3rd Infantry Division said, "We can't see the sun, we live like rats," "No songs can be heard on the positions, and we are even too lazy to talk."

Although the US government gives American soldiers on the front line an extra "bunker allowance" (combat pay) every month, the soldiers are terrified of staying on the front line for one more day. Sometimes they hear the wind and think it is a shell coming, fearfully calling it "the teeth of hell." They call their wounded comrades who are sent back "lucky soldiers," and even praise the festering wounds on their comrades as "invaluable wounds." A soldier from the US 7th Infantry Division said, "Give me a million dollars, and I still wouldn't want to stand guard once." United Press reporter Panden reported from the western front of Korea on November 14 about the "terrible side" of American soldiers, saying: In the communication trenches, there are leg bones, hip bones, everything. If you go and see after just eating, you will really want to vomit. Two days ago, they buried the body of an American soldier. This reporter said: Three people in the past eighteen days on this mountain have become lunatics. One commando went crazy just after returning from an attack. It took the strength of three people to hold him down and tie him up with telephone wires. A lieutenant sleeps under the trench, face down, as soon as he hears the cannon, saying, "Are the Chinese coming? Are the Chinese coming?" There is also a young man, he has nothing wrong with him, just sits in the bunker and cries. The question that American soldiers are most concerned about is: "When can we go home?"

There is only one time when the enemy's frontline soldiers can escape the terror of death, and that is when our army uses propaganda shells to distribute propaganda leaflets to the enemy. When our army starts firing propaganda shells, American and Syngman Rhee's puppet soldiers rush out of the bunkers one after another, picking up propaganda leaflets and taking the opportunity to defecate and urinate. Because they know that at this time our artillery and snipers are ordered not to fire.

When the Korean and Chinese People's forces launched a powerful counter-offensive in the winter of 1950, the phrase "pack your bags" was once popular among American soldiers. If "pack your bags" reflected the lost and desperate appearance of the American soldiers in the great retreat at that time, then "keep your head down" is a sign of the further decline in the morale of the American soldiers under the constant attacks of our army.

    在我军强大炮火打击下
    美军士气越来越低
    【新华社朝鲜前线十七日电】本社前线记者报道：“低下头来！”是近来侵朝美军士兵中流传着的话。美军俘虏说：新兵上阵时老兵给他们上的“第一课”就是“低下头来”。在前线阵地上，美国士兵们不敢轻易地走出工事；一出工事就像受惊的兔子，低头弯腰地沿着深深的交通沟飞跑。因为他们深怕被突然飞来的炮弹和子弹打倒。
    战线上的变化是很快的。半年多以前，美国侵略军在阵地上架着帐篷，时常在里面饮酒，跳舞。但是现在我军猛烈的炮火和射击准确的子弹，已经迫使美国大兵们“低下头来”，紧紧地躲在单人壕与地堡里，好几个小时连动也不敢动。他们吃不到热饭，有时还得整天饿肚子，甚至连大小便也只好装在罐头盒里往外扔。一个美军第三师的俘虏说：“我们看不见太阳，过的是老鼠的日子”，“阵地上已经听不到歌声，甚至话都懒得说。”
    虽然美国政府给在前线的美军士兵每月增发“地堡津贴”（战斗津贴），但士兵们却骇怕自己在前线多待一天。他们有时听到风声，就以为是炮弹来了，恐惧地称呼它是“地狱的牙齿”。他们把负伤回去的同伴叫做“幸运的士兵”，甚至把同伴身上流着脓血的伤口赞为“万金不换的伤口”。美军第七师的一个士兵说：“给我一百万元，我也不愿意放一次哨”。合众社记者潘登十一月十四日自朝鲜西线报道美国大兵们“糟糕的一方面”的情形说：在交通壕里腿骨、臀骨，什么东西都有。假使你刚吃过饭前去看看，真要吐起来。两天以前还埋了一个美国兵的尸首。这个记者说：有三个人在过去的十八天中在这个山上变成了狂人。一个突击队员刚刚出击回来发了疯，费了三个人的力量才把他按住，用电话线把他捆绑起来。一个中尉一听大炮就睡在战壕底下，脸朝下，说：“中国人打来了吗？中国人打来了吗？”还有一个小伙子，他一点没有毛病，只是坐在地堡里哭喊。美国兵们最关心的问题是：“什么时候可以回家”。
    只有一个时候敌军前线士兵才能够免于死亡的恐怖，那就是我军用宣传弹向敌人撒发宣传品的时候。当我军开始发射宣传弹的时候，美国和李伪军的士兵们都争先恐后地从地堡里一拥而出，一面拾宣传品，一面乘机去大小便。因为他们知道这个时候我军炮兵和狙击手是奉命不开火的。
    一九五零年冬天朝中人民部队连续发起强大反攻的时候，美军士兵中曾经盛传着“打背包”这句话。如果说“打背包”反映了当时美国兵在大溃退中失魂落魄的狼狈相，那末，“低下头来”就是目前美国兵在我军不断打击下士气更加低落的标志。
