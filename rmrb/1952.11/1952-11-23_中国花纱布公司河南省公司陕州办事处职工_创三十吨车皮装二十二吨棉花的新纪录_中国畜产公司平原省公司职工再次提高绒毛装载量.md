Employees of the Shanzhou Office of the Henan Provincial Company of China National Cotton Yarn & Cloth Corporation Set a New Record of Loading 22 Tons of Cotton in a 30-Ton Railcar
Employees of the Pingyuan Provincial Company of China National Animal By-Products Corporation Once Again Increase Wool Loading Capacity
    All the employees of the Shanzhou Office of the Henan Provincial Company of China National Cotton Yarn & Cloth Corporation, in close cooperation with local packing workers, railway bureau employees, and loading and unloading workers, improved the cotton wooden machine packing method and created a new record of loading 22 tons of cotton in each 30-ton railcar.
    In the past, the loose cotton purchased by the Shanzhou Office was packed using privately-owned packing machines, which meant high rents and large expenses. Due to the different structures of the machines, the specifications of the bales were inconsistent and the volume was very large. The railway bureau stipulated that each 30-ton railcar should carry 15 tons of cotton, but previously each car carried less than 10 tons, which wasted freight, railcars, and storage space.
    In April of last year, the Central South China Cotton Yarn & Cloth Corporation called on its affiliates to conduct cost quota work and organized a cost quota work group to assist the former Shanzhou Branch. Under the impetus of this group, all employees began to recognize the importance of improving packaging and increasing technical loading capacity to reduce commodity costs. In July 1950, the employees suggested using old double-box packing machines for packing. Li Xituan, Deputy Manager of the Henan Provincial Cotton Yarn & Cloth Corporation, and Li Fang, an engineer from the Luoyang Packing Factory, did not understand the situation in depth, and believed that repairing such old packing machines would be a waste if they could not be used, so they did not adopt their suggestion. Some packing workers also believed that if the packing method was improved, the company would save money, but the cotton bales carried by the workers would also be heavier, so they were unwilling to improve the packing method. The cadres of the office criticized the erroneous thinking of some packing workers and invited veteran workers from the Qunli Packing Factory to jointly study ways to improve the packing machine. Finally, with the support of Zhao Jie, the manager of the former Shanzhou Branch, the old packing machine was repaired. The first experiment created a record of loading 16.5 tons of cotton in a 30-ton railcar.
    During the "Full Load, Over-Axle, 500-Kilometer Movement" carried out by the railway transportation department, the Shanzhou Office of the Cotton Yarn & Cloth Corporation contacted the Shanzhou Station and organized a technical research group including loading and unloading, and packing workers to jointly study the problem of making the flower bales produced by the wooden machine suitable for the railcar volume. They successively came up with good methods to increase the weight of the bales, make the packaging neat, improve the loading technology, and eliminate the gaps in the carriages to increase the loading capacity.
    The result of this continuous improvement in packaging is that the volume of wooden machine bales is reduced to 0.448 cubic meters, with an average weight of 260 jin per bale, creating a new record of loading 22 tons of cotton in a 30-ton railcar.
    Due to the increase in the weight and the decrease in the volume of the flower bales, taking June 1951 as a base, Shanzhou alone can save 2.3 billion yuan in transportation costs and 72 railcars per year.
    After Wang Ruiming and other storage and transportation personnel of the Pingyuan Provincial Company of China National Animal By-Products Corporation modified the wooden cotton packing machine into a wool packing machine and created a record of loading 25.5 tons of wool in a 30-ton railcar, they continued to study and created a new record of loading 33 tons of wool in each 30-ton railcar.
    The Hebei Provincial Company of China National Animal By-Products Corporation absorbed the experience of loading 25.5 tons of wool in a 30-ton railcar created by Wang Ruiming and others (this news was published in this newspaper on September 8) and drafted a plan to load 32 tons of wool in a 30-ton railcar. Some comrades in the storage and transportation section of the Pingyuan Provincial Company saw the plan of the Hebei Provincial Company and felt that their work was lagging behind, so they were not in high spirits. Wang Ruiming, on the one hand, educated these people, and on the other hand, studied the car loading plan drawings of the Hebei Provincial Company with warehouse worker Wang Yunqing and others, and found that they increased the pressure of the machine to reduce the volume of the wool bales, and then increased the number of bales loaded. Wang Ruiming absorbed the experience of the Hebei Provincial Company, drew a new car loading plan, and studied it with all the packing workers, and created a new record of loading 33 tons of wool in a 30-ton railcar, exceeding the quota of loading 17 tons of wool in a 30-ton railcar stipulated by the railway bureau by more than 94 percent.

### 中国花纱布公司河南省公司陕州办事处职工  创三十吨车皮装二十二吨棉花的新纪录  中国畜产公司平原省公司职工再次提高绒毛装载量

    中国花纱布公司河南省公司陕州办事处职工
    创三十吨车皮装二十二吨棉花的新纪录
    中国畜产公司平原省公司职工再次提高绒毛装载量
    中国花纱布公司河南省公司陕州办事处全体职工，和当地打包工人、铁路局职工、装卸工人密切配合，改进了棉花木机包装法，创造了每三十吨的车皮装载棉花二十二吨的新纪录。
    过去陕州办事处收购的散花，都是租用私商的打包机来打包的，租金高，费用大；由于机子构造不一样，成包的规格既不一致，体积也很大。铁路局规定每个三十吨的车皮要装十五吨棉花，但从前每车还装不够十吨，既浪费了运费，又浪费了车皮和仓位。
    去年四月，中南区花纱布公司号召所属进行费用定额工作，并组织了费用定额工作小组，到前陕州分公司协助工作。在该小组的推动下，全体职工开始认识了改进包装、提高技术装载量对降低商品费用的重要意义。一九五○年七月，职工们建议利用旧双箱打包机来打包。河南省花纱布公司副经理李西团和洛阳打包厂工程师李方没有深入了解情况，就认为修理了这种旧打包机，如不能用，还是浪费，所以没有采纳他们的意见。部分打包工人则认为改进了打包办法，公司节省了，工人扛的棉花包也重了，所以也不愿改进包装方法。该处干部对部分打包工人的错误思想进行了批判，又邀请了群力打包厂的老工人来共同研究改进打包机的办法，终于在前陕州分公司经理赵杰支持下，把旧打包机修理好了。第一次试验，就创造了三十吨车皮装载棉花十六吨半的纪录。
    在铁道运输部门开展“满载、超轴、五百公里运动”时，花纱布公司陕州办事处和陕州车站取得联系，组织了包括装卸、打包工人参加的技术研究小组，共同研究使木机打出的花包适应车皮容积的问题，先后想出增加成包重量，并使包装整齐，改进装车技术，消灭车厢空隙以增加装载量的好办法。
    这样不断改进包装的结果，使木机包成包体积缩小为○·四四八立方公尺，每包平均重二六○斤，创造了三十吨车皮装载二十二吨棉花的新纪录。
    由于花包的重量增加，体积缩小，如以一九五一年六月为基础，仅陕州一地，每年即可节省运费二十三亿元，节省车皮七十二个。
    中国畜产公司平原省公司储运人员王瑞明等，把木制棉花打包机改装成绒毛打包机，创造了三十吨车皮装载绒毛二十五点五吨的纪录后，又继续钻研，创造了每个三十吨车皮装载三十三吨绒毛的新纪录。
    中国畜产公司河北省公司吸收了王瑞明等创造的三十吨车皮装载二十五点五吨绒毛的经验（本报九月八日刊载了这个消息），拟出了三十吨车皮装载三十二吨绒毛的计划。平原省公司储运科有些同志看到河北省公司的计划，认为自己的工作落后了，因此情绪不高。王瑞明一面向这些人进行教育，一面和仓库工人王云卿等研究河北省公司的装车计划图样，发现他们是加大了机子的压力，缩小了绒包的体积，于是增加了装包数。王瑞明吸收了河北省公司的经验，划出了新的装车图样，和全体打包工人共同研究，又创造了三十吨车皮装载三十三吨绒毛的新纪录，超过铁路局规定的三十吨车皮装载十七吨绒毛的定额达百分之九十四强。
