    Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Iron Smelting Plant Promotes Advanced Soviet Experiences
    Large Blast Furnace Ironmaking Creates New National Record
    (Xinhua News Agency, 3rd) The Iron Smelting Plant of the state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company, in the process of promoting advanced Soviet operational methods such as the "full blast, fast feed, smooth operation method," a certain blast furnace created a new national record for large blast furnace ironmaking in October. The average utilization coefficient of the effective volume of the blast furnace was reduced to 0.7. On the 29th, the utilization coefficient was further reduced to 0.602. The production of first-grade steelmaking pig iron also reached 100% of the product. The highest record achieved by this furnace this time was 47.4% lower than the average utilization coefficient in 1950 before the implementation of the Soviet ironmaking operation method (the average utilization coefficient in 1950 was 1.146). The daily output of iron increased by 90.6%, reaching 216% of the original design capacity of the furnace. The ratio of coke to iron was also reduced from 1.072 in 1950 to 0.72. The new record created by this furnace greatly exceeds the output of similar blast furnaces in capitalist countries, reaching the ironmaking level of similar blast furnaces in the Soviet Union. This is a new victory in China's iron and steel industry. At present, all the workers of this blast furnace have revised the production plan for the fourth quarter in order to greet the 35th anniversary of the founding of the great socialist Soviet Union and the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" with practical actions. They guarantee that they will further increase production from continuing to learn advanced Soviet ironmaking operation methods, completely eliminate defective products, make first-grade steelmaking pig iron reach 95% of the products, and strive to complete the annual national production plan and increase production and practice thrift plan ten and a half days ahead of schedule.

    鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂推行苏联先进经验
    大型高炉炼铁创造全国新纪录
    【新华社三日讯】国营鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂在推行苏联“全风快料顺行法”等先进的操作法中某号高炉在十月份创造了大型高炉炼铁的全国新纪录。高炉有效容积平均利用系数降低到零点七，二十九日的利用系数更降低到零点六零二，一级制钢生铁也达到了产品的百分之百。该炉这次所达到的最高纪录比推行苏联炼铁操作法以前一九五零年的平均利用系数降低了百分之四十七点四（一九五零年平均利用系数是一点一四六）。铁的日产量提高了百分之九十点六，达到了该炉原来设计能力的百分之二百十六。焦炭与铁的比率也由一九五零年的一点零七二降低到零点七二。该炉这次所创造的新纪录大大超过资本主义各国同样高炉的产量，达到了苏联同样高炉的炼铁水平。这是我国炼铁工业上一个新的胜利。目前这个高炉的全体职工为了以实际行动迎接伟大的社会主义苏联建国三十五周年和“中苏友好月”已重新修订了第四季度的生产计划，他们保证从继续学习苏联先进的炼铁操作法中进一步提高产量，全部消灭废品，使一级制钢生铁达到产品的百分之九十五，争取提前十一天完成全年的国家生产计划和增产节约计划。
