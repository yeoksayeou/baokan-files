Xinhua News Agency, December 12th: The Chinese Academy of Sciences held a symposium from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM on the afternoon of the 11th, inviting Grusenko, a member of the Soviet Cultural Workers Delegation, Academic Secretary of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Doctor of Biology, and two-time Stalin Prize winner, to introduce the work of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. The symposium was attended by Li Siguang, Tao Menghe, Zhu Kezhen, Wu Youxun, vice presidents of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, heads of various departments of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and heads of research institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing: atomic physicist Dr. Qian Sanqiang, botanist Dr. Qian Chongshu, paleontologist Dr. Yang Zhongjian, physicist Dr. Peng Huanwu, physicist Dr. Lu Xueshan, psychologist Ding Zan, historian Fan Wenlan, linguist Luo Changpei, archaeologist Xia Nai, and more than 30 others.
    The symposium was presided over by Tao Menghe. Tao Menghe first delivered a speech, expressing a warm welcome to Grusenko for attending the symposium. Tao Menghe said: "Only by intensifying our study of the advanced scientific experience of the Soviet Union can our Chinese scientific workers better serve the people and the construction of the country." Then Grusenko stood up and spoke amid warm applause. Grusenko first expressed that he felt very honored to have the opportunity to talk with Chinese scientists. Grusenko made an incisive and detailed speech on the status of science in the Soviet Union, the Soviet government's emphasis on and strong support for scientific research, the organizational structure of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and the planning and practical connection of scientific research work in the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Grusenko pointed out that science occupies an extremely important position in the national construction and people's lives of the Soviet Union. Due to the great contribution of science to the Soviet state and the Soviet people, the Soviet government and people pay great attention to and support scientific work. From 1946 to 1951, the Soviet government used 46 billion rubles for scientific research work. At present, the number of people in the Soviet Academy of Sciences has increased sixty times compared with the number of people in the Academy of Sciences in the Tsarist era. Grusenko introduced in detail the organizational structure, working methods and working steps of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Grusenko believes that the road of Soviet science is the road closely connected with the lives of the people. Grusenko emphasized that thanks to the strong support of the Soviet government, the high degree of planning and close contact with reality, the scientific research work of the Soviet Academy of Sciences has made remarkable achievements, and has made the scientific level of the Soviet Union surpass that of capitalist countries. For example, the Soviet Union's achievements in studying the splitting of atomic nuclei are a step ahead of the United States. Grusenko said with full confidence that there are no scientific and technological problems that cannot be solved in the Soviet Union. Problems that can be solved by capitalist countries can also be solved by the Soviet Union, and problems that cannot be solved by capitalist countries can also be solved by the Soviet Union. The great communist construction project, the Lenin Volga-Don Canal, is a clear example. Grusenko finally said that Soviet scientists welcome strengthening the exchange of scientific work experience with Chinese scientists, and welcome creative cooperation with Chinese scientists.
    After Grusenko's speech, Chinese scientists Qian Chongshu, Zhu Kezhen, and Wu Youxun successively spoke, unanimously believing that they had obtained many urgently needed things and knowledge from Grusenko's speech, and expressed their gratitude for Grusenko's report. Chinese scientists also asked Grusenko some questions, and Grusenko answered them in detail.

Xinhua News Agency, December 12th: Grusenko, a member of the Soviet Cultural Workers Delegation, Academic Secretary of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Doctor of Biology, and two-time Stalin Prize winner, was invited on the 12th to attend the symposium on biological issues held by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The symposium was presided over by Qian Chongshu, director of the Institute of Plant Classification of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The symposium was attended by 26 biologists from the Insect Room, Botanical Institute, and Genetic Cultivation Room of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, the Central Health Research Institute, Peking University, Beijing Agricultural University, Beijing Normal University, Peking Union Medical College, and other units.
    The symposium was held at 4:30 pm. First, Director Qian Chongshu delivered a welcome speech. He expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet scientists for their concern and help to Chinese scientific workers. Next, Grusenko spoke. According to the results of experiments by successors of the Soviet Michurin school, Grusenko proved that the heredity of plants, asexual hybridization and sexual hybridization are completely the same, and are not necessarily absolutely based on chromosome division. Grusenko also explained in detail the conclusions of the Soviet Union's research on plant cells. He said: cells do not necessarily originate from cells, cell nuclei do not necessarily originate from cell nuclei, chromosomes also do not necessarily originate from chromosomes, but can be produced by biological nature. During the symposium, Grusenko used slides to help illustrate his correct arguments. For example, when he talked about "artificial control of variation" in livestock improvement, he showed the process of increasing the weight and milk production of cows. Originally, the cow weighed 200 kilograms and only produced 15 kilograms of milk per day; but after 35 years of selection and mating, the cow's weight increased to 700 kilograms, and the daily milk increased by more than two times.
    Grusenko's vivid and insightful speech on biological theories was warmly welcomed by Chinese scientists.
    Before attending the symposium, Grusenko, accompanied by Chen Fengtong, director of the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, visited the institute's main crop pest and specimen exhibition room. Grusenko was particularly interested in the exhibits such as the "genetic phenomenon of white eggplant grafted on nine-leaf eggplant" studied by Zu Deming, an expert in Chinese plant hybridization genetics, and chatted with Chinese experts for more than half an hour under these eggplant drawing exhibits.

    格鲁森科连日参加中国科学院座谈会
    介绍苏联科学院工作情况并对生物学问题发表意见
    【新华社十二日讯】中国科学院在十一日下午二时至六时举行座谈会，邀请苏联文化工作者代表团团员、苏联科学院学术秘书、生物学博士、斯大林奖金两次获得者格鲁森科介绍苏联科学院工作情况。参加座谈会的有中国科学院副院长李四光、陶孟和、竺可桢、吴有训以及中国科学院各部门负责人、中国科学院所属在京各研究所负责人：原子物理学家钱三强博士、植物学家钱崇澍博士、古生物学家杨钟健博士、物理学家彭桓武博士、物理学家陆学善博士、心理学家丁瓒、史学家范文澜、语言学家罗常培、考古学家夏鼐等三十多人。
    座谈会由陶孟和主持。陶孟和首先致词，对格鲁森科出席座谈会表示热烈欢迎。陶孟和说：“我们中国科学工作者只有加紧学习苏联的先进科学经验，才能更好地为人民服务、为国家的建设服务。”接着格鲁森科在热烈的掌声中起立发言。格鲁森科首先表示他能有机会与中国的科学家交谈，使他感到十分光荣。格鲁森科就科学在苏联的地位、苏联政府对科学研究工作的重视与大力支持、苏联科学院的组织情况、苏联科学院科学研究工作的计划性与联系实际等方面，作了精辟详尽的发言。格鲁森科指出：科学在苏联的国家建设与人民生活中占着极重要的地位。由于科学对于苏维埃国家与苏联人民的伟大贡献，苏联政府和人民对科学工作给予极大的关注和支持，从一九四六年到一九五一年之间，苏联政府用于科学研究工作的经费达四百六十亿卢布。目前苏联科学院的人数比帝俄时代的科学院的人数增加了六十倍。格鲁森科详细地介绍了苏联科学院的组织情况、工作方法与工作步骤。格鲁森科认为苏联科学的道路就是与人民生活密切联系的道路。格鲁森科强调指出：由于苏联政府的大力支持，由于高度的计划性与密切联系实际，苏联科学院的科学研究工作已做出了显著成绩，已经使苏联的科学水平超过了资本主义国家。例如苏联在研究分裂原子核方面的成就已比美国先进了一步。格鲁森科充满信心地说：在苏联没有不能解决的科学技术上的问题，资本主义国家可以解决的问题，苏联同样可以解决，资本主义国家不能解决的问题，苏联也可以解决。伟大的共产主义建筑工程列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河就是明显的例子。格鲁森科最后表示，苏联科学家欢迎和中国科学家加强交流科学工作的经验、欢迎和中国科学家实行创造性的合作。
    格鲁森科发言结束后，与会的中国科学家钱崇澍、竺可桢、吴有训等先后发言，一致认为从格鲁森科的讲话中获得了许多迫切想知道的事情和知识，对格鲁森科的报告表示感谢。中国科学家并向格鲁森科提了一些问题，格鲁森科一一作了详细的解答。
    【新华社十二日讯】苏联文化工作者代表团团员、苏联科学院学术秘书、生物学博士、斯大林奖金两次获得者格鲁森科于十二日应邀参加中国科学院所举行的生物学问题座谈会。座谈会由中国科学院植物分类研究所所长钱崇澍主持。参加座谈会的有中国科学院昆虫室、植物所、遗传栽培室，华北农业科学研究所，中央卫生研究院和北京大学、北京农业大学、北京师范大学、协和医学院等单位的生物学家二十六人。
    座谈会在下午四时半举行，首先由钱崇澍所长致欢迎词。他对苏联科学家对中国科学工作者的关心和帮助，表示衷心的谢意。接着，格鲁森科讲话。格鲁森科根据苏联米丘林学派继承者们实验的结果，证明植物的遗传，无性杂交和有性杂交完全相同，不一定绝对根据染色体的分裂。格鲁森科并且详细地说明了苏联在植物细胞方面研究的结论，他说：细胞不一定自细胞中产生，细胞核不一定自细胞核中产生，染色体亦不一定自染色体中产生，而可以由生物本性产生。在座谈中，格鲁森科利用幻灯片来帮助说明他的正确论点。例如当他讲到牧畜改良方面的“人为控制变异”时，就放映增加牛的体重和产乳量的过程。原来牛体重二百公斤，每天只出十五公斤乳汁；但经过三十五年的选择和交配以后，牛的体重便增加到七百公斤，每天的乳汁则增加了两倍以上。
    格鲁森科对生物学理论方面的生动而精辟的讲话受到了中国科学家们热烈的欢迎。
    格鲁森科在参加座谈会以前，曾由华北农业科学研究所所长陈凤桐陪同，参观了该所各主要农作物的病虫害和标本陈列室。格鲁森科特别对中国植物杂交遗传研究专家祖德铭所研究的“白茄嫁接在九叶茄上的遗传现象”等陈列感到兴趣，在这几张陈列的茄子图纸下，和中国专家们攀谈了半个多小时。
