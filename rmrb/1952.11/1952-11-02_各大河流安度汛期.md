Xinhua News Agency Report:

    All major rivers across the country have safely passed the flood season, and flood prevention work in various regions has successfully concluded. This year, the Yangtze River and Huai River basins experienced substantial rainfall in the upper and middle reaches, leading to sharp rises in water levels in both the main streams and tributaries, forming massive flood peaks. The water level at Shashi on the Yangtze River reached 43.89 meters. The Han River, the largest tributary of the Yangtze, also surged continuously, repeatedly exceeding or approaching historical high-water levels. Coupled with the simultaneous rise in the Yangtze River, the downstream floodwaters struggled to discharge, resulting in a sustained battle to protect the embankments along the Yangtze and Han rivers. In the Huai River basin, individual areas such as Mengcheng, Guzhen, and Xincai experienced rainfall exceeding or approaching that of 1950. At Honghekou, the flood peak on September 1st reached 28.37 meters, 2 decimeters higher than the same period last year, with the water surface nearly level with the embankment. At Runheji, the flood peak on September 3rd reached 26.11 meters, exceeding the danger level by more than 1 meter. Provinces and regions in East China, such as Fujian, Zhejiang, southern Jiangsu, and northern Jiangsu, and in Central South China, such as Guangdong and Hunan, suffered several major typhoons and rainstorms. Although the water levels in the Yellow River and rivers in Northeast China were relatively stable this year, they also experienced flood peaks of varying sizes. Since July, successive rainfalls in North China have caused the Zhang River, Ziya River, Yongding River, and others to swell. At Guantai on the Zhang River (also known as Liuhegou, northwest of Anyang), the water level on August 1st rose sharply to 149.88 meters, exceeding the guaranteed water level by 5.3 meters.
    These water conditions and levels created both hardship and complexity for this year's flood prevention efforts. However, under the leadership of local Party and government organizations, regions along the rivers mobilized cadres and the masses to form a strong flood prevention force, resolutely fighting against the floods and ensuring safety in most areas. During the autumn flood season, over one million people were deployed to the main embankments of the Yangtze and Han rivers, with approximately 300,000 people on the embankments at the same time on the busiest day. In Hebei Province, on the 5,000-kilometer flood prevention front line, 2,068 cadres, over 12,400 members of standing flood prevention teams, and over 466,700 members of emergency response teams and reserve teams were mobilized. Shandong Province also mobilized over 226,400 people to participate in flood prevention work. This year, flood prevention efforts in various regions were generally arranged earlier, taking the initiative in the fight against the floods. Thanks to timely flood reporting, early preparation, and the personal leadership of key cadres on the embankments, although some collapses occurred, no major accidents occurred. In East China, early preparation and appropriate defense measures were also taken to defend against typhoons. Some areas rushed to harvest early-maturing crops, and sea dikes and river embankments did not breach, allowing for the rapid drainage of rain and floodwater.
    The safe passage of major rivers through the flood season this year demonstrates that the water conservancy construction projects and embankment reinforcement projects of the new China over the past three years have yielded significant benefits. The Jingjiang section of the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, which suffered the most severe flood threat, was able to safely navigate the flood season because the Jingjiang Dike was reinforced this year, coupled with a strong flood prevention organization, even though the flood peak was higher than in 1951. When the water level at Honghekou on the Huai River surged dramatically, the Huai River Flood Prevention Headquarters decided to open the Menghe diversion channel, which lowered the flood peak level, not only ensuring the safety of the Huai River embankments downstream of Honghekou but also leading to a bumper harvest of autumn crops in the area bordering Henan and Anhui. Many tributaries of the Huai River, such as the Xifei River, Ci River, Tuo River, and Sui River, did not breach during this year's flood season due to dredging and improvement work over the past two years. The steel wire probing method created by farmer Jin Zhao from Pingyuan Province last year played a significant role in eliminating hidden dangers in the Yellow River embankments. This year, farmer Ma Zhenxi from Shandong Province improved the probing tool, using a thicker steel wire for probing, discovering and filling over 40,000 holes, further ensuring the safety of the embankments.

    各大河流安度汛期
    【新华社讯】全国各大河流都已度过洪水时期，各地防汛工作已胜利结束。今年长江流域和淮河流域由于上、中游降雨量较大，干流和支流的水位都曾猛烈上涨，形成了巨大的洪峰。长江沙市水位曾经达到四三·八九公尺。长江的最大支流汉水也连续猛涨，每次都超过或接近历年的最高水位。加以和长江同时涨水，因此受到长江水势的顶托，下游洪水难以宣泄，使江、汉两岸各堤段的防护工作形成持久搏斗的局面。淮河流域有个别地区如蒙城、固镇、新蔡等地，降雨量超过或接近一九五○年。洪河口在九月一日洪峰到达二八·三七公尺，比去年同期水位高二公寸，水面差不多与堤相平。润河集九月三日洪峰到达二六·一一公尺，已超过危险水位一公尺多。华东区的福建、浙江、苏南、苏北和中南区的广东、湖南等省区，曾遭受几次巨大台风和暴雨的侵袭。黄河和东北各河流今年的水势虽较平稳，但也出现过大小不同的洪峰。华北各地七月以来先后降雨，漳河、子牙河、永定河等都曾涨水。漳河观台（即六河沟，在安阳西北）八月一日水位曾陡涨到一四九·八八公尺，超过保证水位五·三公尺。
    以上的水情和水位，造成了今年防汛工作的艰苦性和复杂性。但是由于沿江、沿河地区在当地党、政领导下，动员干部和群众组成了强大的防汛力量，和洪水进行坚决斗争，使多数地区得到了安全。长江和汉水干堤在秋汛中先后有一百多万人上堤，最多的一天曾有约三十万人同时上堤。河北省在堤长五千公里的防汛战线上，曾动员干部二千零六十八人、防汛常备队一万二千四百多人、抢险队和后备队四十六万六千七百多人。山东省也动员了二十二万六千四百多人参加防汛工作。今年各地的防汛工作一般都布置得较早，在和洪水斗争中争取了主动。由于报汛及时，准备较早，主要干部亲自上堤领导，虽然发生几处坍蛰，但是终未出险。华东在防御台风当中，也因为准备较早，防御得宜，有些地区抢收了早熟作物，海塘和河堤都未溃决，雨涝积水也很快地排出。
    今年各大河流能够安全度过汛期说明新中国三年来的水利建设工程和堤防加固工程已收到显著效益。遭受洪水威胁最严重的长江中游荆江段，因为今年荆江大堤加固了，再加上强大的防汛组织，洪峰虽然高过一九五一年，但沿江人民终于安度汛期。淮河洪河口水位猛烈暴涨时，淮河防汛指挥部决定开放了濛河分洪道，使洪峰水位降低，不仅保障了洪河口以下淮河堤防的安全，并使河南、安徽交界处的一片秋庄稼获得丰收。淮河的很多支流，如西淝河、茨河、沱河、濉河等，由于两年来疏浚整理，今年汛期中都未决口。黄河河堤去年采用平原省农民靳钊创造的钢丝锥探法，对消灭堤身隐患起了很大作用。今年山东省农民马振锡把锥探用具加以改进，改用较粗钢丝锥探，发现和填补四万多个洞穴，进一步保证了堤防的安全。
