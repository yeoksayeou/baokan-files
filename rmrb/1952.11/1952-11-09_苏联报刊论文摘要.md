    **Opposing the Distortion of the Principles of Collective Methods in Artistic Creation**

    In the Soviet Union, some painters have an incorrect understanding of the principles of collective creation methods in art. They mistakenly believe that collective creation methods will produce a new quality, achieving results that a single artist cannot match. They say that collective methods are good because in a collective, painters can be matched according to the principle of "mutual supplementation." They seem to think that as long as a famous portrait painter, a skilled landscape painter, a painter adept at color mixing, and a capable sketch artist are brought together, a kind of all-powerful collective can be produced.

    Recently, at Soviet art exhibitions, various collectively created so-called "magnificent" works have frequently appeared. Even portrait paintings, landscape paintings, and book illustrations that should possess special and original individuality are collectively completed. This distorted view of the principles of collective creation methods has drawn serious attention from the "Soviet Art Newspaper." On September 20th, the newspaper's editorial department published a commentary entitled "Opposing the Distortion of the Principles of Collective Methods in Artistic Creation," criticizing the above-mentioned erroneous ideas, and pointing out under what conditions collective creation methods can achieve good results, and what organizational forms collective creation should take. The abstract is as follows:

    Collective creation methods are applicable and necessary, especially when completing major national tasks and when executing heavy and complex artistic work.

    The working method of collective creation can only be correct when the collective of painters or sculptors is organized on the basis of creative principles, and only when the creative intentions of the members of the collective are consistent. However, even a collective composed entirely of creative painters or sculptors still needs an experienced leader. Only the strong leadership will of the leader can give the collective work the necessary purposefulness, integrity, and artistic consistency.

    Facts have proven that the most successful works are created when the creative collective observes these organizational conditions. The consistency of the creative thinking of all members of the collective, the skilled leadership of the leading painter, and the clever and sensitive direction and use of the creative potential of each painter—a member of the collective—are the guarantees of success.

    It should also be said that a collective of young painters led by experienced painters is the best school for studying artistic techniques. Young painters, working with and constantly observing the activities of the leading painter, can gain the most valuable practical knowledge and learn from the leader's creative experience.

    However, in order to avoid fragmenting the integrity of the artistic works created, the members of the collective themselves should also understand the unified overall idea—the artistic intention—and find a way of working that allows everyone to发挥发挥their creative individuality without damaging or violating artistic harmony in the works.

    The experience of collective work proves that many painters and leaders of creative organizations fail to correctly understand the principles of collective creation methods and apply them in practice. Recently, there have been more and more collectively creations organized by young painters who lack both rich creative experience and sufficient knowledge. Perhaps they believe that the form of collective creation will strengthen the power of each of them.

    The experience of the All-Soviet Art Exhibition of 1951 shows that young painters' collectives that lack a skilled and experienced leader usually cannot create good works. Paintings created according to the principle of "mutual supplementation" among painters in the collective are easily doomed to the fate of the unfortunate cart described in Krylov's fable, loaded with a swan, a shrimp, and a pike. In the case of such an understanding of the method of collective creation, the serious danger that is likely to arise is that the individuality of independent art will be submerged, and the face of the collective creation will be damaged by one painter. Even the ideological and artistic essence of the work will be distorted, thus becoming a peculiar exhibition of different creative styles pieced together.

    Collective creation methods can be used as one of the forms of artistic creation, but the principles that have been tested and proven must be followed. Replacing individual creation with an unaccountable "mutual supplementation" approach usually fails. A distorted understanding of the nature and task of collective creation methods is undoubtedly one of the reasons for the serious backwardness of our fine arts in recent years. If this irregular situation continues, it will create the bad habits of irresponsibility and lack of strict requirements for works among some painters, which will be a serious obstacle to the further development of Soviet fine arts in the future.

    **The Question of Guiding Children's Extracurricular and Out-of-School Work**

    The Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League and the Ministry of Education of the Russian Federation jointly held a meeting on September 10 this year to study the issue of improving the leadership of children's extracurricular and out-of-school activities. School principals, Young Pioneer leaders, and leading workers from the Children's Books Publishing Bureau, "Young Pioneer Houses," and other institutions were invited to participate. The Soviet Teachers' Newspaper published a report by Dubrovinina, Deputy Minister of Education of the Russian Federation, on September 13, which is excerpted as follows:

    The leadership work of children's extracurricular and out-of-school activities, jointly organized by schools, the Communist Youth League, and the Young Pioneers, has an increasingly significant and particularly important role in the overall system of communist education for youth. This primary method of promoting the all-round development of children is an integral part of school teaching. Its task is to consolidate and deepen the knowledge that children have gained at school, enable them to apply it in practice, cultivate noble moral qualities, expand students' political and general education horizons, help to best complete the task of students' polytechnic education, prepare students to freely choose a profession after graduating from middle school, and cultivate children's interests in mechanics, art, sports, and other aspects.

    The content of children's extracurricular and out-of-school activities is diverse. However, behind this diversity, there are often phenomena such as the randomness and disorder of work, the lack of purpose, and the disconnection from the content of school teaching.

    Krupskaya criticized during her lifetime: the Young Pioneer House "only receives talented children and top students, but not street children. These children run around in the streets, and no one thinks of organizing their free time."

    Currently, some staff members of our schools and out-of-school educational institutions are committing this mistake. When leading extracurricular and out-of-school activities, they only rely on the most organized and well-performing students. Sometimes, they even determine in principle that failing students are not allowed to participate in various groups, or they prescribe different extracurricular and out-of-school activities for them; sometimes, they even prevent "students who get a C grade" from participating.

    However, the experience of excellent teachers proves that some students' academic and disciplinary problems can often be successfully resolved only through these extracurricular and out-of-school activities.

    It is an extremely important task to greatly increase the number of students participating in a variety of extracurricular work forms, organize this work in every school, and absorb all teachers to participate. But at the same time, it is important to always remember not to overburden students with extracurricular work. In order to improve the leading role of schools in extracurricular and out-of-school work, it is very important for schools and some out-of-school educational institutions to establish correct mutual relations and necessary contacts.

    To further improve extracurricular and out-of-school work and expand its scope, cadres play a decisive role. Teachers, as the core figures, should primarily be responsible for the organization and content of extracurricular and out-of-school work. However, the role of teachers still needs to be improved. When training future teachers, various normal schools do not adequately arm them with the ability to guide extracurricular and out-of-school work.

    Therefore, the issue of teachers' preparation for this work, the correct selection and allocation of cadres in extracurricular and out-of-school work, and the issue of implementing planned instructions and supervision of this work are of paramount importance.

    Extracurricular and out-of-school work is far from meeting the overall task of cultivating future builders of communism, because the leadership of the national education organs is not satisfactory. Various national education organs should rely on the experience of advanced teachers, Communist Youth League, and Young Pioneer workers to vigorously improve their leadership.

    **Fully Support Production Innovators**

    The Labor Daily published an editorial on September 6, pointing out the issues that should be paid attention to in promoting and implementing the experience of advanced producers. The abstract is as follows:

    The experiences and achievements of innovators are a great wealth of our country. The draft of the new Five-Year Plan of the 19th Party Congress states: "We must give maximum support to the efforts of innovators in industry and collective agricultural production, advanced workers in transportation, and other sectors of the national economy to increase output, increase labor productivity, and reduce production costs."

    The Party requires all our organizations to constantly rely on advanced things, to fully support them, and to strive to increase and promote progressive initiatives.

    Establishing the verbal and written publicity work of innovators' production methods well and organizing technical studies in a planned manner are of paramount importance for the promotion of advanced experience. Trade union organizations should carefully supervise this; when compiling plans for learning technology and improving workers' skills, take into account the recent achievements of innovators. Correct forms of transmitting experience that have been proven, such as Stakhanovite worker schools, must be more widely adopted within enterprises and between factories. The Stakhanovite workers' "Tuesdays," visits to similar enterprises, exchange of experience meetings, and lectures and reports in various clubs and cultural palaces must be promoted more frequently. Production meetings can also play an important role as forums for advanced experience.

    We must resolutely improve the work of some of our country's scientific publishing houses. The books published by these publishing houses often arouse the rightful criticism of Stakhanovite workers. For example, many books published by the State Technical Books Publishing House of the Fuel Industry for the reading of workers in the petroleum industry do not reflect the most advanced petroleum production methods and are still promoting outdated technologies. The Ministry of Coal Industry has published very few books on the experience of mastering new coal mining machinery. Technical bulletins issued by central ministries report the achievements of advanced workers very slowly. The publication of pamphlets on the experience of Stakhanovite workers is also often delayed for months.

    However, in order to familiarize workers with the experience of advanced workers and to organize the publicity of this experience well, it is only part of the matter. It is important to ensure the use of advanced experience in production and to make Stakhanovite-style revisions to the technical processes. For example, the Ural Machine Manufacturing Factory organizes its work in this way; they comprehensively study and summarize the experience of Stakhanovite workers, and then legalize this experience in production technology.

    All regions should handle the work in this way. After the experience has been studied and proven in practice, it should immediately become public property.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    反对歪曲艺术创作的集体方法的原则
    在苏联，有些画家对于艺术作品集体创作方法的原则有着不正确的理解，他们错误地认为，集体创作方法，会产生一种新的质量，达到单独一个艺术家赶不上的成绩。他们说，集体方法所以好，就因为在集体中能够按照“互相补充”的原则配搭画家。他们仿佛认为只要把一个肖像名画家，一个风景画能手，一个善于调色的画家和一个能干的素描家集合在一起，就可以产生那么一种万能的集体了。
    近来，在苏联的画展上，时常出现各种集体创作的所谓“壮丽的”作品，甚至有些应当具有特殊的、独创的个性的肖像画、风景画和书中插图也都是集体完成的。这种对集体创作方法原则的歪曲的看法，引起了“苏维埃艺术报”的严重注意。该报编辑部于九月二十日发表以“反对歪曲艺术创作的集体方法的原则”为题的评论，批判上述的错误思想，并指出集体创作方法在什么条件下才能达到良好结果，和集体创作应当采取怎样的组织形式。摘要如下：
    集体创作的方法，是适用而且必需的。首先是在完成重大的国家任务的时候，在执行繁重复杂的艺术工作的时候。
    集体创作的工作方法，只有在画家或雕刻家的集体在创作原则的基础上组织起来时，只有集体的成员的创作意图一致时，才可能是正确的。但是，甚至全是有创作能力的画家或雕刻家所组成的集体，也还需要一个有经验的领导者。只有领导者的坚强的领导意志，才能给集体工作以必要的目的性、严整性和艺术上的一致性。
    事实证明：最成功的作品都是在创作集体遵守这些组织条件的情况下，创作出来的。集体的一切成员的创作思想的一致，领导画家对他们的熟练的领导，对每个画家—集体的成员—创作可能性的巧妙地和灵敏地指挥和使用，就是成功的保证。
    还应当说，青年画家的集体得到有经验的画家的领导，就是研究艺术技巧的最好的学校。青年画家同领导画家在一起工作并经常地观察他的活动，就可以获得最宝贵的实际知识，学习到领导者的创作经验。
    但是，为了免得所创作的艺术作品的完整性割裂，集体的成员自己也应当理解统一的总的思想—艺术意向，找出一种工作方式来，使每个人都能发挥自己的创作个性，而不致在作品上破坏或是违反艺术的和谐性。
    集体工作的经验证明：画家和创作组织的领导者们有不少人对集体创作方法的原则，都不能正确地理解，并用之于实践。近来，既没有丰富的创作经验又没有足够的知识的青年画家们所组织的一些集体创作，愈来愈多了。他们也许认为，集体创作的形式会使他们每一个人的力量加强的罢。
    一九五一年的全苏联画展的经验说明：凡是缺少技巧熟练的有经验的领导者的青年画家集体，通常是不能创作好作品的。按照集体中的画家们“互相补充”的原则所创作出来的画，很容易遭到像科雷洛夫的寓言中所描写的一辆装载着天鹅、虾和梭鱼的不幸的大车的命运。在这样理解集体创作方法的情况下，容易产生的严重危险是独立的艺术的个性会被淹没，集体创作的面目，会因一个画家而受损。甚至作品的思想和艺术本质也会遭受到歪曲，从而变成不同的创作风格杂凑起来的一种奇特的展览图片。
    集体创作方法可以作为艺术创作的形式之一，但是必须遵守上述那些考验过的和被证实了的原则。以无人负责的，“互相补充”的办法代替个人的创作，通常是会失败的。对集体创作方法的性质和任务的歪曲理解，无疑地就是近年来我们的美术严重落后的原因之一。这种不正规的情况继续下去，会造成一些画家对作品不负责任和要求不严格的恶习，那就是今后苏联美术进一步发展的道路上严重的阻碍了。
    领导儿童进行课外和校外工作问题
    全苏列宁共青团中央委员会和俄罗斯联邦教育部于本年九月十日联合召开了一次会议，研究改善领导儿童课外和校外活动的工作问题。学校校长，少先队队长和儿童书籍出版局，“少先队之家”等机关的领导工作者被邀参加。苏联教师报九月十三日发表了俄罗斯联邦教育部副部长杜伯洛维娜在这次会议上的报告，现摘要如下：
    学校、共青团和少先队所共同组织的对儿童课外和校外活动的领导工作，在青年的共产主义教育的总体系中具有日益显著的特别重要的意义。这一种促进儿童全面发展的首要方法是学校教学工作中不可分割的一部分。它的任务是：巩固和加深儿童在学校中所获得的知识，使他们能够在实际上加以运用，培养崇高的道德品质，扩大学生在政治和一般教育方面的视野；帮助对学生的工艺学教育最好地完成任务，使学生在中学毕业后有自由选择职业的准备；培养儿童对机械、艺术、体育等各方面的兴趣。
    儿童的课外和校外活动的内容是多种多样的。但是，在这种多样性的后面，却常隐藏有工作的偶发性和紊乱，目的性的缺乏以及与学校教学内容脱节等现象。
    克鲁普斯卡娅在生前作过这样的批评：少先队之家“单只接收有天才的儿童和优等生，而不接收街头儿童。这些儿童在街头乱跑，没有人想到把他们的空闲时间组织起来。”
    目前我们的学校和校外教育机关的一些人员正犯上了这个毛病。他们在领导课外和校外活动时，单只依靠最有组织的和成绩良好的学生。有时竟在原则上确定不许不及格的学生参加各种小组，或给他们另订各种课外和校外活动的办法；有时，甚至还不让“得三分的学生”参加。
    但是优良的教师的经验证明：一些学生的成绩和纪律问题，往往只有通过这些课外和校外活动，才可以获得成功的解决。
    以多种多样的课外工作形式大量扩充学生的参加人数，在每一个学校中组织这种工作并吸收所有的教师来参加，是一个极重要的任务。但同时要时时记住不使学生的课外工作过重。为了提高学校在课外和校外工作中的主导作用，学校和校外一些教育机关建立正确的相互关系和必要的接触是非常重要的。
    要进一步改进课外和校外工作并扩大其范围，干部是具有决定性作用的。作为核心人物的教师，首先应对课外和校外工作的组织和内容负责。但教师的这个作用却还需提高。各个师范学校在培养未来的教师时，没有适当地以指导课外和校外工作的本领来武装他们。
    因此，教师对这种工作的准备问题，在课外和校外工作方面正确地选拔和分配干部、对这种工作实行有计划地指示和监督的问题，有着头等重要的意义。
    课外和校外工作所以远赶不上培育未来共产主义建设者的总任务，是由于国民教育机关的领导不能令人满意。各个国民教育机关应当依靠先进的教师、共青团和少先队工作者的经验，大力改善自己的领导。
    全力支持生产革新者
    劳动报九月六日发表社论，指出在推广和实施先进生产者的经验中所应注意的事项，摘要如下：
    革新者的经验，他们的成就，是我们国家的巨大财富。第十九次党代表大会的新五年计划指示草案中说：“必须对工业和集体农业生产中的革新者、运输业及国民经济其他部门中的先进工作者的增加产量、提高劳动生产率和减低生产成本的努力，予以最大的支持。”
    党要求我们的一切组织应经常依靠先进事物，以全力支持它，并尽力使进步的创举增多和推广。
    把革新者生产方法的口头和文字的宣传工作良好地建立起来，有计划地组织技术学习，这对于先进经验的推广具有头等重要的意义。职工会组织应当用心地予以监督；在编制学习技术和提高工人熟练程度的计划时，估计到革新者们最近的成绩。业经证实的传达经验的正确形式，如斯塔哈诺夫工作者学校之类，在企业内部和厂与厂之间，必须更广泛地加以采用。必须更经常地推行斯塔哈诺夫工作者的“星期二”，参观性质相近的企业，举行交流经验会议，并在各个俱乐部和文化宫更经常地举行讲演和报告。生产会议也是可以起先进经验讲坛的重要作用的。
    必须坚决地改进我国一些科学出版局的工作。这些出版局所出的书经常引起斯塔哈诺夫工作者的正当责难。例如国家燃料工业技术书籍出版局为供给石油业工人阅读而出版的很多书籍，都没有反映最进步的石油生产方法，仍在宣传过时的技术。煤业部所出版的有关掌握新式煤矿机器的经验的书籍为数很少。中央各部所出的技术通报对于先进者成绩的报道，非常迟缓。关于斯塔哈诺夫工作者经验的小册子的出版，也往往拖延到数月之久。
    但是为了使工人熟悉先进者的经验，良好地组织对这种经验的宣传，只是事情的一部分。重要的是保证使用先进经验于生产中间，对技术过程作斯塔哈诺夫式的修正。例如乌拉尔机器制造工厂就是这样地把工作组织起来；他们综合地研究了和总结了斯塔哈诺夫工作者的经验，再在生产技术中把这种经验法定起来。
    各地都应当这样地处理工作。在经验经过了研究，并在实践中获得了证实之后，应当立即把它变成公共的所有物。
