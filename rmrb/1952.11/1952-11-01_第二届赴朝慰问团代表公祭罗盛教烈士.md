    第二届赴朝慰问团代表公祭罗盛教烈士
    【新华社讯】中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团的一部分代表于十月十七日赴“罗盛教山”公祭不朽的国际主义战士罗盛教烈士。
    公祭在哀乐声中开始。由慰问团陈沂副总团长主祭，罗盛教烈士所在部队的军、师首长陪祭。被烈士抢救复生的朝鲜少年崔?和他的父母，也按朝鲜礼节备置供品，参加祭奠。
    中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团总团及慰问团中的中国人民解放军代表、中国人民抗美援朝总会代表、各民主党派代表、各人民团体代表和各兄弟民族代表等都向罗盛教烈士敬献花圈。
    陈沂副总团长在烈士墓前讲话，他指出，罗盛教烈士是我们伟大中华民族舍己救人的光荣传统的继承者，也是我们抗美援朝战争中千万个壮烈行动中的杰出范例。这是罗盛教的光荣，也是中国人民志愿军全体同志的光荣，尤其是我们祖国人民和我们伟大领袖毛泽东主席的光荣。我们祖国将以有罗盛教这样的优秀儿女为千秋万世的骄傲。罗盛教烈士的伟大的国际主义精神，不仅深深地感动了英雄的朝鲜人民，也深深地教育了我们祖国人民。我们今天祭奠罗盛教烈士，同时也是对光荣牺牲在朝鲜战场上的许多具有爱国主义与国际主义精神的英勇战士表示深切的悼念。
    中国人民志愿军某部政治部杨中行副主任说：“罗烈士的英雄行为代表着中朝人民鲜血凝结的永久牢固的友谊。”他号召该部全体指挥员、战斗员学习罗盛教烈士伟大的爱国主义国际主义精神，与朝鲜人民更加亲密团结，战胜美帝国主义侵略军，完成烈士的遗志。
    被罗烈士抢救复生的朝鲜十八岁少年崔?，也带着沉痛感激的心情讲话。崔?在罗盛教烈士牺牲后即认罗盛教为哥哥，曾特地写信给罗烈士的父亲罗迭开，称他为父亲。崔?在墓前说：“罗盛教哥哥，我永远忘不了你，我现在已积极参加以你的英名命名的生产突击队，争取多打粮食，支援前线。如我明年被批准参加人民军，我一定握紧枪杆学习你的战斗精神，坚决打击美帝国主义，来报答你救我的恩情，完成你保卫和平的伟大遗志。”
    公祭历时一时十分始毕。
