Xinhua News Agency, November 2nd: The Beijing Urban and Rural Materials Exchange Conference closed on October 31st. Fifty-three primary and secondary market trade delegations, comprising over 2,100 representatives from both public and private sectors, participated in the conference. The total transaction volume reached over 850 billion yuan, exceeding the original plan of 500 billion yuan by 71 percent. Industrial products accounted for 63.2 percent, while local and special products accounted for 36.8 percent.

    A major feature of the Beijing Autumn Materials Exchange Conference was its focus on the primary market, promoting local industrial and handicraft products. For example, the private copper wire mesh industry sold off 800 rolls of window screening that had been stockpiled for three months, and the private fur manufacturing industry sold off 500 red fox leg pieces that had been stockpiled for over three years. Simultaneously, many private industries signed several futures contracts with trade representatives from various regions, resolving production and sales issues for a considerable period. For instance, the private iron industry signed a contract for 50,000 walking plows with the Shanxi trade delegation, which could resolve half a year's worth of production for the industry. Additionally, Beijing's private industries undertook the production of several new products. At the conference, the Hebei Province Cooperative General Corporation required a large amount of chemical fertilizer. However, there were no factories in Beijing producing such fertilizer. Therefore, private chemical factories such as Zhengfeng and Jincheng applied to the government to organize joint ventures and undertook the production of 2,000 tons of chemical fertilizer for the Hebei Province Cooperative General Corporation.

    State-owned trading companies fully demonstrated their leading role in the conference transactions. First, they actively took the lead in making deals in the spirit of "buying and selling actively" and "large-scale buying and selling." Brand-name and popular products at the conference were purchased and sold in a unified manner and rationally allocated under the leadership of the state-owned economy. This prevented private merchants from rushing to purchase goods and the state-owned trading companies and cooperatives from "taking everything." Under the influence of the correct policies of the People's Government, private industrialists and merchants actively engaged in transactions. For example, the private silk and cloth industry purchased various wool fabrics worth over 49 billion yuan at the conference, exceeding the original procurement plan by more than double.

    The conference was very cautious in signing contracts. Each contract underwent careful consideration, mutual consultation between buyers and sellers, and approval by the conference. To supervise public and private industrial and commercial enterprises in various regions to earnestly implement the contracts, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau and the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce will organize contract inspection agencies to regularly supervise contract implementation and promptly resolve problems arising during implementation, so as to consolidate the results of the conference.

    北京物资交流会闭幕
    【新华社二日讯】北京市城乡物资交流大会已于十月三十一日闭幕。参加这次大会的有五十三个初级和中级市场贸易代表团，公营和私营代表二千一百余人。大会成交总额达八千五百多亿元，超过原计划五千亿元百分之七十一。其中工业品占百分之六十三点二，土特产品占百分之三十六点八。
    北京市秋季物资交流大会的主要特点是面向初级市场，推销了本地的工业和手工业产品，例如私营铜丝罗底业积压了三个月的八百匹窗纱，私营皮毛制造业积压三年多的五百件红狐腿，在大会上都完全推销出去。同时有许多私营行业与各地贸易代表签订了若干期货合同，解决了今后相当时期的产销问题。如私营铁工业与山西贸易代表团签订五万台步犁的合同，就可解决该行业半年的生产问题。此外，北京市私营工业还承制不少新的产品。会上热河省合作总社需要大量的化学肥料，可是北京市没有生产这种肥料的工厂，于是私营正丰、今诚等化工厂就呈请政府组织合营，承做了热河省合作总社两千吨化学肥料。
    国营贸易公司在大会交易中，充分发挥了领导作用。首先本着“有买有卖”、“大买大卖”的精神积极带头成交。对于大会上的名牌货和热货都是在国营经济领导下统一购销合理分配的。这样就防止了私商抢购和国营贸易公司、合作社“包下来”的偏向。私营工商业在人民政府正确政策的感召下积极进行交易。如私营绸布业在大会上购买各种呢绒布匹价值达四百九十多亿元，超过了原来采购计划一倍以上。
    大会对签订合同十分慎重，每份合同都经过买卖双方缜密考虑、互相协商和大会批准的。为了监督各地公私营工商业者认真执行合同，北京市人民政府工商局和市工商联将组织合同检查机构，定期监督合同执行，并及时解决执行中所发生的问题，以巩固大会的成果。
