    Sincere Friendship
    ——Introducing Soviet Experts of the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Han Wenhui
    Winter has not yet arrived, but the Tianshan Mountains are already covered with thick snow, and a piercingly cold wind blows all day long. The Soviet experts and technicians of the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company are working selflessly here day and night. Some of these experts and technicians are model workers from the Stakhanovite movement, some are heroes who defended Stalingrad, and some still bear the glorious scars of liberating Berlin and Northeast China.
    "We must help our Chinese brothers build their beloved motherland with the spirit of building our socialist motherland!" This was the instruction of a Soviet mechanic at the refinery to a newly arrived Soviet technician at the start of his work. This sentence represents the sincere internationalist friendship of every Soviet comrade at the oil mine. After the Soviet comrades arrived here, they encountered many difficulties in their work. Most of the workers did not understand technology, so the Soviet experts and technicians not only had to plan every task but also had to do everything themselves, often working continuously for two or three days and nights without rest, even eating next to the machines. At night, the Soviet experts and technicians rarely had a peaceful sleep, often getting out of bed several times to go to the mine to guide the work. The director of the oxygen plant, Avail, even built an oxygen plant without a single technical worker. He managed the machine operation himself while teaching the workers technical skills. The workers took shifts to rest, but he often couldn’t leave the machines all day and night. Once, his eyes were bloodshot, and he hadn't slept for three days and nights, but he still stood staring at the machines running. A worker moved a stool for him to sit down, but he said, "No sitting! I'll fall asleep as soon as I sit down." The chief engineer of the oilfield department, Gorotov, is an old worker. In the Soviet-German War, he defended Stalingrad and drove the German invaders from Stalingrad to Berlin. He was injured several times, and one leg was somewhat disabled, but whether it was windy or snowy, day or night, he often walked from one well to another to guide the work. As soon as he arrived at the well, he worked with the workers to carry iron pipes and move machines. Sometimes, when he was overworked, his wounds would ache. When the workers advised him to rest, he always said, "Work is important!"
    In April this year, when drilling an oil well near the oil layer, because the workers were not skilled enough, they did not close the gate in time. Gas spewed out violently from the bottom of the well, reaching more than 400 meters into the air. The derrick was showered with torrential rain-like mud and crude oil. The gas made it difficult for workers to approach the wellhead, and it looked like the well was about to collapse. Gorotov and all the Soviet engineers in the oilfield department rushed to the well after hearing the news. They didn't even bother to change their clothes before running to close the gate. One person was overcome by the fumes, and another replaced him. From eight o'clock in the morning until twelve o'clock at night, they finally managed to close the gate. When the work was finished, everyone looked like they had come out of a mud pit.
    The Soviet comrades often work selflessly like this. Every Soviet comrade remembers the two tasks Comrade Stalin gave them before they came to China: to help the Chinese brothers build and to train technical cadres for China. Most of the workers in the oil mine are newly arrived Uyghur farmers from the countryside and Kazakh herders from the grasslands. They have never seen such complex machines and do not understand the Soviet language. As soon as the Soviet experts arrived at the oil mine, they drew up a systematic plan for training workers. First, they explained the names of the machines and tools to the workers, as well as safety knowledge and the simple principles of the machines. They taught one day and tested the next. If they didn't learn, they taught and tested again. As soon as the workers began to master the machines, the Soviet experts stood by their side like an older brother leading a younger brother, never leaving. He would demonstrate first and then hand the machine over to the worker. If the worker moved his hand wrong, he would immediately correct it. Sometimes some complex operating methods could not be gestured by hand. The Soviet experts would draw pictures on the ground to explain. During drilling, the workers initially couldn't figure out the geology underground and couldn't apply pressure according to the hardness of the strata. The Soviet experts stood next to the workers, and when the sound of the diesel engine changed, they would tell the workers how to distinguish the hardness of the geology. After one practical exercise after another, the workers knew what the strata was like hundreds of meters below the well as soon as they started the drilling rig. If they encountered difficulties in their work, the Soviet experts would first explain the cause and solution to the workers, and then guide the workers to handle it themselves. Once, on the oil well led by expert Mocortis, the square drill pipe suddenly broke from the top (usually it breaks from the bottom of the well). Mocortis calmly called the workers to the well platform and said, "This is a special accident, the second time I've encountered it in twenty-five years." He explained in detail the cause of the accident and how to deal with it to the workers, and then he stood in front of them and let the workers handle it themselves. The sincere attitude and good methods of the Soviet experts impressed the workers deeply with everything they taught. In less than two years, a large number of technical workers who could work independently emerged in various departments of the oil mine. Many Uyghur farmers and Kazakh herders became drillers in eight months, skilled turners on new electric lathes in three months, and even drove tractors on the oil fields three days later. In the second half of this year, in order to train a large number of technical personnel more quickly, various departments have opened technical training classes. Soviet experts and technicians take time out of their busy schedules to personally compile systematic study plans and textbooks and teach workers basic theoretical knowledge. In order to make it easier for the workers to remember during class, Soviet experts and technicians painstakingly drew diagrams of the structure of the machines to explain, and compared the complex machine parts and their functions to the same structures on the human body. Then they led the workers to the machines for experiments.
    The Soviet experts are very concerned about the lives of their Chinese worker brothers. When the weather gets cold, they check whether the workers are wearing enough clothes, and if they are wearing too little, they repeatedly tell them to wear more next time. This year, a very young worker came to the oilfield department. When the director of the oilfield department, Pidorolovsky, discovered that he had an eye disease the next day he went to work, he immediately told the worker to go to the hospital for treatment and stipulated that he should leave work an hour early every day. But Pidorolovsky was still not at ease, and on the third day, he assigned a special person to take the worker to the hospital every day until he was cured. Pidorolovsky also often went to the workers' club to entertain with the workers. He told the workers about the development history of the Baku oil fields in the Soviet Union, how the Baku workers overcame difficulties and developed to today's scale, and then talked about the bright future of the oil mine here, encouraging the workers to study technology well. Before National Day this year, drill expert Mocortis and a driller he led once exchanged their fountain pens after studying how to launch a production competition to welcome our country's third National Day. Mocortis said, "I will protect this pen well, and tell others when I return to my country: I have a Chinese friend named Wang Bingchen; you should also protect it well and keep it as a souvenir of our time together!" After Wang Bingchen took the pen, he shook Mocortis's hand vigorously and said, "I will always treat it as a souvenir of you training me to become a skilled technician!"

    真挚的友谊
    ——介绍中苏石油股份公司的苏联专家
    新华社记者  韩文慧
    冬季还没有到来，天山已堆满了厚厚的白雪，终日刮着透骨的寒风。中苏石油股份公司的苏联专家和苏联技术人员们，日日夜夜在这里忘我地工作着。这些专家和技术人员有的是斯达哈诺夫运动中的模范工作者，有的是保卫斯大林格勒的英雄，有的还带着解放柏林和我国东北的光荣伤痕。
    “我们要以建设我们社会主义祖国的精神来帮助中国兄弟建设他们可爱的祖国！”这是炼油厂一位苏联机械师对新来的一位苏联技师开始工作时的叮咛。这句话代表着油矿上每位苏联同志真挚的国际主义友谊。苏联同志到这里后，工作上遇到了许多困难。多数的工人不懂技术，苏联专家和技术人员不仅要策划每一件工作，还要事事亲自动手，经常一连两三个昼夜不得休息，吃饭也在机器旁边。在夜里，苏联专家和技术人员很少睡过一个安宁觉，常常几次从被窝里爬出来跑到矿井上去指导工作。氧气厂的厂长阿外尔竟在没有一个技术工人的情况下，建立起一个氧气厂。他自己一面管理机器操作，一面教工人学习技术。工人轮班休息，而他常常整天通宵不能离开机器。有一次他的眼睛熬得通红，已经整整三天三夜没有睡觉了，但是仍然站着盯着机器运转。有一个工人搬了个凳子让他坐下，他说：“不坐！一坐下就睡着了。”油田处的总工程师果洛脱夫是个老工人，苏德战争中他保卫过斯大林格勒，又从斯大林格勒把德寇赶到柏林。他负过好几次伤，一只脚有些残废了，但不管是刮风或下雪，白天或夜里，他经常徒步从这个井跑到那个井指导工作。一到井上他就和工人一起扛铁管、搬机器。有时，过分劳累了，伤口就疼痛，工人劝他休息，他总是说：“工作要紧！”
    今年四月间，钻一个油井钻到油层附近时，因工人技术不够熟练，没来得及关住闸门，瓦斯从井底猛烈地喷射出来，冲到半空四百公尺以上，井架跟前洒着暴雨般的泥水和原油，瓦斯熏得工人难以接近井口，眼看这口井就要被冲垮了。果洛脱夫和油田处所有的苏联工程师闻讯后全跑到井上来。他们连衣服也没顾上换，就跑去关闸门。这个被熏晕了，那个又换上去，从早晨八点钟直到晚上十二点钟才关住闸门。工作完毕时，每个人都像从油泥坑里出来的一样。
    苏联同志们经常都是这样忘我地工作着。每个苏联同志都记着他们到中国之前，斯大林同志交给他们的两项任务：帮助中国弟兄建设和为中国培养技术干部。油矿上的工人大多数是从农村新来的维吾尔族农民和从草原上来的哈萨克族牧民，他们从未见过这样复杂的机器，又不懂苏联语言。苏联专家一到油矿上就拟定了系统培养工人的计划。他们首先给工人讲解机器、工具的名称，以及安全知识和机器的简单原理等。今天教了，第二天就考试，没有学会再教，再考。工人一开始掌握机器，苏联专家就像哥哥领着弟弟走路一样，站在身边不离开。他先做个样子，然后把机器交给工人，工人手搬错了，他马上矫正过来。有时有些复杂的操作方法不能用手比划出来。苏联专家就在地上画图来解释。在钻井的时候，起初工人老摸不清井下的地质，无法按地层的软硬施用压力。苏联专家站在工人身旁，当柴油机的声音一变，就告诉工人怎样辨别地质的软硬。经过一次又一次的实习后，工人一开动钻机就知道几百公尺的井底是什么样的地层。如果在工作中遇到困难，苏联专家就先给工人说明原因和解决的办法，再指导工人自己处理。有一次，在莫可尔蒂斯专家领导的那个油井上，方钻杆突然从上面断了（一般是从井底里断），莫可尔蒂斯从容地把工人叫到井台下面说：“这是一种特殊事故，是我二十五年来遇到的第二次。”他详细地把事故发生的原因和处理的办法讲给工人听，然后他站在跟前让工人自己来处理。苏联专家这种诚恳的态度和良好的方法，每教一件事都使工人深刻地印在脑子里。不到两年时间，油矿上各个部门涌现出大批能独立工作的技术工人。许多维吾尔族农民、哈萨克族牧民，有的八个月就成为一个钻井员，有的三个月成为一个新式电动镟床上的熟练车工，有的竟在三天以后就驾上拖拉机在油田上工作。今年下半年，为了更快地培养出大批技术人员，各部门都开办了技术训练班，苏联专家和苏联技术人员从百忙中抽出时间来，亲自编出系统的学习计划和课本，给工人教初步的理论知识。上课时为了工人便于记忆，苏联专家和苏联技术人员费尽心机把机器上的构造绘出图来解释，把机器复杂的机件性能、作用与人体上相同的构造来比喻说明。然后又把工人领到机器旁边实验。
    苏联专家非常关怀中国工人弟兄的生活，天气一冷，就检查工人衣服穿得够不够，如果穿得单薄了，就一再叮咛下次多穿些。今年油田处来了个很年轻的工人，当他第二天上班后，油田处处长皮多劳洛夫斯基发觉他患眼病，立即告诉这个工人到医院去医疗，还规定他每天提前一小时下班。但皮多劳洛夫斯基还不放心，第三天又指派了专人，每天领这个工人去医院，直到看好了才放心。皮多劳洛夫斯基还经常到工人俱乐部和工人一起娱乐，他给工人讲苏联巴库油田的发展史，讲巴库工人怎样克服了困难而发展到了今天的规模，然后又谈到这里油矿未来的光辉，鼓励工人好好学习技术。今年国庆节前，钻井处莫可尔蒂斯专家和他领导的一个钻井员，有一次在研究怎样展开迎接我国第三届国庆节的生产竞赛后，两个人互相交换了自己的水笔。莫可尔蒂斯说：“我把这枝笔牢牢保护好，将来回国后告诉别人：我有一个中国朋友叫王炳臣；你把它也好好保护着，留作咱们相处的纪念！”王炳臣接过这枝水笔后，用力握着莫可尔蒂斯的手说：“我永远把它当作你培养我成为熟练技术工人的纪念！”
