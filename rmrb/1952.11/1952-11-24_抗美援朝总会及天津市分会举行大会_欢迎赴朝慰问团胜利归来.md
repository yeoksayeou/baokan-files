Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 23rd: The Chinese People's Anti-Aggression and Aid Korea Headquarters and the Tianjin Anti-Aggression and Aid Korea Branch held a grand meeting in Tianjin at 2 p.m. on the 23rd to warmly welcome the victorious return of the Second Chinese People's慰问团 to Korea.

The meeting was presided over by Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Anti-Aggression and Aid Korea Headquarters. More than 2,000 people attended the meeting, including heads of various democratic party organizations, people's organizations, troops, and government agencies.

After Huang Songling, Chairman of the Tianjin Anti-Aggression and Aid Korea Branch, delivered the opening speech, Guo Moruo delivered a welcoming speech. On behalf of the Anti-Aggression and Aid Korea Headquarters and the people of the whole country, he expressed a warm welcome to the victorious return of the 慰问团 and deep condolences to Comrade Gao Qingsheng, a glorious martyr who sacrificed his life in the 慰问工作, and expressed condolences to the comrades who were gloriously wounded in the work. He then said: The comrades of the 慰问团 have returned victoriously. We hope that you will widely convey to the people of all strata throughout the country the great victory you have witnessed on the Korean front and the heroic spirit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, the Korean People's Army, and the Korean people. At the same time, we hope that all comrades of the 慰问团 will make a broad report to the people of all strata in China on the most urgent needs of our most beloved people that you have felt on the front line. Our people across the country will surely meet the most urgent needs of our most beloved people with the greatest enthusiasm. Guo Moruo finally said: Now, large-scale economic construction and cultural construction work is coming to us. At present, the people of China need a high degree of patriotism and internationalism to meet the upcoming high tide of national construction. Therefore, I especially hope that the comrades of the 慰问团 will further promote the spirit of patriotism and internationalism more universally and deeply after returning to their respective regions, so that all the Chinese people can strengthen the movement to increase production and practice economy and strengthen the work of supporting the Korean front with the fighting spirit of the volunteers to prepare for the sacred task of undertaking large-scale planned construction.

Liu Jingfan, the head of the 慰问团, expressed sincere gratitude and high respect to the people of China, the Chinese People's Anti-Aggression and Aid Korea Headquarters, and the local branches on behalf of all the comrades of the 慰问团. He described the work of the 慰问团, saying: In this 慰问工作, the comrades of the 慰问团 were not afraid of hardships and dangers and worked actively. Photography assistant Comrade Gao Qingsheng contributed his precious life to protecting the machine during the 慰问 on the front line, and several other comrades were gloriously wounded. We express our deep condolences to Martyr Gao Qingsheng and express our cordial condolences to the gloriously wounded comrades. He said: After the 慰问团 arrived at the front line, it received a universal, warm, and cordial welcome from the front line. Our most beloved people—the Chinese People's Volunteers—cherish the deep affection of the people of the motherland very much. They regard the 慰问团 as the envoys of the people of the motherland and the representatives of Chairman Mao and take care of us in every possible way. The Korean people and the People's Army also love us in the same way. When the 慰问团 arrived in Pyongyang, it was warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life in Pyongyang. Liu Jingfan said: The 慰问 from the people of the motherland gave the volunteers great encouragement. Lü Zhonghe, a sniper in a certain unit, had killed 113 enemies. After receiving the 慰问 candy from the people of the motherland this time, he counted 126 pieces of candy in a bag. He decided that he would only eat a piece of candy after killing an enemy in the future, in order to repay the 慰问 of the people of the motherland. After Liu Jingfan described in detail the great victory on the Korean front and the high morale of the Chinese and Korean people's troops, he said: We guarantee to follow Chairman Guo's instructions and convey the great victory on the front line and the gains of the 慰问团's work to the people of the whole country universally and deeply, so as to promote the people of the whole country to further deepen the Anti-Aggression and Aid Korea movement and extensively carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, in order to meet the great victory of large-scale economic construction and cultural construction next year.

After the speech of the head of the 慰问团 Liu, members of the Tianjin Children's Team presented flowers to the responsible comrades of the 慰问团. Finally, the Peking Opera Team of the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government performed wonderful programs to慰问 the 慰问团.

Before the welcoming meeting, the Chinese People's Anti-Aggression and Aid Korea Headquarters and the Tianjin Branch also held a grand banquet to entertain all members of the 慰问团. At the meeting, everyone constantly toasted for the great victory of Anti-Aggression and Aid Korea and for the health of Chairman Mao.
