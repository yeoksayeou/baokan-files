    A Record of a Conversation Between Two Surrendered Li Pseudo-Army Soldiers
    Gong Jiemin

    In early October, the Volunteer Army on the North Han River front launched a massive political offensive against the enemy. At the forward positions, small, crack "political offense teams" were organized everywhere. Every night, singing and Korean-language shouts from loudspeakers echoed across the positions. This mass-based, combat-oriented political offensive effectively coordinated with the victorious counterattacks of our army, achieving the goals of disintegrating the enemy army and weakening its morale. Hearing the calls, pseudo-soldiers surrendered to us in twos and threes. Some pseudo-soldiers took advantage of the opportunity to pick wild fruits, hiding in the bushes to wait for a chance to run to our positions. Others slipped down the hillside while on guard duty at dawn and ran to our side. Upon reaching our positions, most of them first pointed to their stomachs, asking for food. The soldiers would take out biscuits, rice, and canned goods to give them a hearty meal. Some of the surrendered pseudo-soldiers complained as soon as they arrived. A surrendered private second class said, "South Korea has suffered a severe drought this year, and food is very scarce. We are constantly hungry. The officers often steal things from the warehouse and sell them to the residents, then come back to eat, drink, and gamble, and beatings and scoldings occur every night." He introduced a rhyme circulating in the 18th Regiment of the Pseudo-3rd Division: "Privates first and second class are rice crust thieves; corporals are biscuit thieves; sergeants are sock thieves; lieutenants are public property thieves..." The liaison officer asked him, "What about majors and lieutenant colonels?" He replied with a smile, "Jeep thieves." The liaison officer asked him why he didn't shave his head. He said, "No money. Each person is supposed to get 3,000 won of pseudo-currency per month, but a lot is deducted for 'regimental expenses,' leaving only 1,500 won, which is barely enough to buy fifteen packs of cigarettes." Asked how he became a soldier, he said very sadly, "Most of the soldiers are poor children forcibly conscripted. When the old folks see their children being taken away, they all say it's 'sending white bones.' The brothers in the 18th Regiment sing this all day long: 'Dead is white bones, alive is white bones, sooner or later we'll become white bones.' The elders in South Korea cry and lament every day: 'When you become a soldier for Syngman Rhee, first your right cheek gets fat (from being beaten), then your left cheek gets fat, when you get to the front your whole body gets fat, and when the fighting starts you all die.'" Another surrendered pseudo-army private second class talked about the tragic situation of the pseudo-soldiers' families. He said, "When we are captured and become soldiers, our families suffer. In my hometown, an old father in his sixties, because his son was taken away, led his daughter-in-law, who had just given birth, to beg for food along the road, and later the daughter-in-law was forced into prostitution." He also talked about the contradictions between the pseudo-army and the pseudo-police: the pseudo-police, because they directly carried out the orders to arrest soldiers, were hated by the people of South Korea. Incidents of pseudo-soldiers taking guns home and killing police officers happened constantly.

    When talking about the effect of our army's calls, they both said, "When you call, the brothers whisper: Listen, they're telling us to come over. But it's not easy to come over, the officers are watching very closely. They also lie to us, saying that if we are captured by the Volunteer Army, we won't survive. So many people can't make up their minds. But no matter what they say, we still came over, because we know that staying there will only lead to death in the end."

    记两个投诚的李伪军的谈话
    宫洁民
    十月初旬，北汉江前线的志愿军，普遍展开了声势浩大的对敌政治攻势。前沿阵地上，到处组织了小型的精悍的“政攻队”。每到夜晚，阵地上就响起了扩音器的歌唱和朝鲜语喊话声。这种群众性的战斗性的政治攻势，有力地配合我军连续进行反击战的胜利，达到了瓦解敌军、削弱敌军斗志的目的。听到喊话的伪军们，三三两两不断地向我投诚。有的伪军乘采摘野果的机会，藏在草丛里，待机跑向我方阵地。有的在拂晓放哨时溜下山坡，跑到我方来。他们一到我们的阵地，大多数都是首先指着肚子要饭吃。战士们就把饼干、米饭、罐头拿出来，给他们饱餐。有些投诚的伪军，一到我方就诉起苦来。一个投诚的二等兵说：“南朝鲜今年大旱，粮食十分缺乏，我们成天吃不饱。当官的则经常偷仓库的东西，偷了拿到居民中去卖，回来就吃喝嫖赌，每天晚上都发生打骂的事件。”他介绍了流传在伪三师十八联队的一段歌谣：“一等、二等兵哪，是锅巴小偷；下士哪是饼干小偷；中士哪鞋袜小偷；中尉哪公物小偷，……”联络员问他：“那么少校、中校呢？”他笑着回答：“吉普车小偷。”联络员问他为什么不剃头，他说：“没钱啦。每人每月规定是伪币三千元饷金，可是光‘连部费’就扣去好多，只剩一千五百元，顶多能买十五棵纸烟。”问他怎么当的兵，他非常伤心地说：“当兵的大部是被强征来的穷家子弟。老人们眼见自己孩子被征走，全说这是‘送白骨’。十八联队的弟兄们成天这样唱：‘死也是白骨，活也是白骨，早晚也得成白骨。’南朝鲜的父老们每天哭哭啼啼地议论：‘当了李承晚的兵，先是右脸胖（挨打），后是左脸胖，来到前线全身胖，打起仗来死个光。’”另一个投诚的伪军二等兵，谈起伪军们家庭的悲惨情况。他说，“我们被抓当兵，家里大人孩子活受罪。我们那里一个六十多岁的老父亲，因为儿子抓走了，他就领着刚生过小孩的儿媳沿里讨饭，后来媳妇被逼为娼。”他又谈起了伪军和伪警察的矛盾：伪警察因为直接执行抓兵的命令，为南朝鲜人民所痛恨。伪军携枪回家打死警察的事不断发生。
    谈到我军喊话的效果时，他们都说：“你们一喊话，弟兄们就小声说：听着，叫我们过去呢。可是过来不容易，当官的监督得很紧。他们还骗我们，说被志愿军抓了就活不成。所以有许多人打不定主意。但不管他们怎么说，我们还是过来了，因为我们知道呆在那边终久只有死命一条。”
