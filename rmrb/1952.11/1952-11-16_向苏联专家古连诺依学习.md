    Learn from Soviet Expert Gulenoy
    To the Editor: Soviet expert Comrade Gulenoy of the Northeast Sujiatun Locomotive Depot is responsible for accounting work. His spirit of adhering to principles in his work has left us with a very deep impression.

    He attaches great importance to financial discipline. He does not pay a single cent for any expenditure that is not stipulated in the production and financial plan. Once, the locomotive depot received a battery flaw detector without the approval of the higher authorities. Comrade Gulenoy discovered it and immediately pointed out: It must be used only after approval from the higher authorities. He often criticizes the erroneous view of some comrades who only emphasize production tasks and do not calculate costs.

    He told us: Even in small matters, we must implement the system of thrift. Under the guidance of Comrade Gulenoy, we have corrected many mistakes. I think we should learn Comrade Gulenoy's spirit of adhering to principles. Liu Chundi

    向苏联专家古连诺依学习
    编辑同志：东北苏家屯机务段苏联专家古连诺依同志，是负责会计工作的。他在工作中坚持原则的精神，给我们留下了极深刻的印象。
    他非常重视财政纪律。凡是生产财务计划里面没有规定的支出，他一文钱也不支付。有一次机务段没有经过上级批准，就领了一个电池探伤器。古连诺依同志发见了，马上指出：必须等上级批准后，才能领用。他经常批评某些同志只强调生产任务而不计算成本的错误观点。
    他告诉我们：即使在细小的问题上，也要贯彻节约制度。在古连诺依同志的指导下，我们纠正了很多错误。我认为我们应该好好学习古连诺依同志坚持原则的精神。　刘春第
