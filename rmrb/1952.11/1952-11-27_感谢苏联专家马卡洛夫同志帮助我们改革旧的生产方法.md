    Thanks to Soviet Expert Comrade Makarov for Helping Us Reform Old Production Methods
    To the Editor: The heating furnace equipment in the forging steel workshop of Fushun Steel Plant was very poor. In the past, operations like pouring raw materials and loading raw materials into the hot furnace took up a lot of production time. Furthermore, often due to a shortage of furnaces or a busy workload, workers were unwilling to load materials in order to produce more, resulting in the next shift having to stop work and wait for materials, thus affecting the efficiency of the steam hammer. When Soviet expert Comrade Makarov saw this unscientific equipment and wasted man-hour phenomenon, he immediately proposed adding a continuous heating furnace in order to improve the production method. Our factory adopted this suggestion. Comrade Makarov personally provided technical guidance during the design. It officially started production in September of this year. This continuous heating furnace has increased production efficiency threefold compared to the original heating furnace and has eliminated the phenomenon of stopping work and waiting for materials.

    感谢苏联专家马卡洛夫同志帮助我们改革旧的生产方法
    编辑同志：抚顺制钢厂锻钢车间加热炉的设备很差，过去操作中，只往热炉中倒原料、装原料就占去很多生产时间。并且往往因为炉少或工作忙，工人为了多出活不愿装料，而造成下一班停工待料，因而影响汽锤发挥效能的现象。当苏联专家马卡洛夫同志看到这种不科学的设备和浪费工时的现象时，便立即提出增设连续式加热炉，以便改进生产方法。我们厂采纳了这个建议。进行设计时，马卡洛夫同志亲自去作技术指导。今年九月便正式开工生产。这种连续式加热炉较原来加热炉的生产效率提高三倍，并消灭了停工待料现象。纪焕章
