Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 15th: The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers achieved their greatest victory in thirteen months during the large-scale counteroffensive in October, annihilating a total of over 63,000 enemy troops throughout the month. This figure is approximately twice the total number of enemies eliminated in September and exceeds the combined total of enemies annihilated during the first and second campaigns in the winter of 1950.

	Over the past month, the Korean-Chinese People's forces launched a series of counteroffensives. Among these counteroffensives, the largest and most intense battles occurred southwest of Yeoncheon, northwest of Cheorwon, southeast of Geumseong, on the east bank of the Bukhan River, and west of Mundung. The battle near Yaksan-dong northwest of Cheorwon was particularly fierce. After our troops captured the enemy's positions in this area on the evening of the 6th, the enemy continuously launched counterattacks, attempting to retake the positions. The fierce battle for the hilltops lasted for nine days and nights. Our troops inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy while repelling their counterattacks, eliminating over 8,000 enemy troops in total and inflicting severe damage on the ROK Army's 9th Division, forcing the enemy to withdraw this crippled unit from the front lines for reorganization and replenishment.

	During this month's counteroffensive operations, our troops captured a total of fifty-eight enemy positions, annihilating two entire battalions, seven entire companies, and forty-four entire platoons of the defending enemy. In addition, the majority of two enemy companies and nine platoons were annihilated. After capturing the enemy positions, our troops inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy while repelling their counterattacks.

	However, the repeatedly defeated enemy, indulging in wishful thinking, launched a so-called "largest offensive" since October of last year in the middle of this month, attempting to concentrate their forces and firepower on a single point to put pressure on our troops in order to gain some small advantage and cover up their failures. However, the reality was contrary to the enemy's wishes. In this "offensive," the enemy suffered even more disastrous defeats. The enemy, gathering a total of two divisions of US and ROK troops under the cover of hundreds of artillery pieces, dozens of tanks, and aircraft, launched attacks on eight of our positions along a ten-mile stretch of the front line from northeast Cheorwon to north of Gimhwa, beginning on the 14th. All of these attacks were repelled by our defending forces. After the 15th, the enemy concentrated even more heavily on attacking our two mountain ridge positions near Sangganling, north of Gimhwa. Our troops launched a heroic defense on these two mountain ridges. As of the end of October, our troops had annihilated over 12,000 enemy troops in the defense of these two mountain ridges, and all the ground fortifications that had been occupied by the enemy had been recovered.

	The situation in October once again proves that not only has our front line been completely stabilized, but we also have sufficient strength to launch tactical counteroffensives against the enemy. Of the dozens of enemy positions captured by our troops this month, fourteen are now under our control. Over the past month, as our troops have strengthened their counteroffensives, the enemy has fallen into an even more passive position. Due to a lack of reserve forces, the enemy can only rob Peter to pay Paul. Therefore, since our troops launched a larger-scale counteroffensive on October 6th, the enemy's rear line units have been frequently redeployed. Under our troops' continuous blows, the replenishment time for the enemy's second-line units has been generally shortened. The ROK 9th Division, which suffered severe damage in the Yaksan-dong area northwest of Cheorwon, had a regiment urgently transferred to the central front just one week after being withdrawn from the front lines to support the enemy's so-called "offensive" on Sangganling. This kind of hand-to-mouth difficulty is something that the enemy cannot overcome no matter what.

	In the second half of October, the enemy conducted four coastal raids on the east and west coasts, all of which were repelled by our troops.

	The results of the operations conducted by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in October are as follows:

	1. Annihilated 63,841 enemy troops (including 6,519 enemy troops killed or wounded by artillery units in artillery battles and 4,662 enemy troops killed or wounded by snipers), including 24,884 US troops, 322 British troops, 233 French troops, 313 Canadian troops, and 38,089 ROK troops.

	2. Major spoils of war: 51 various artillery pieces, 3 flamethrowers, 2 anti-aircraft machine guns, 472 light and heavy machine guns, 2,788 various rifles, and 237 various communication equipment items.

	3. Shot down or damaged 824 enemy aircraft, including 271 shot down and 553 damaged; destroyed or damaged 128 enemy tanks; destroyed or damaged 119 enemy vehicles of various types; destroyed or damaged 81 enemy artillery pieces of various types; damaged one enemy destroyer and sunk two enemy landing craft.

    朝中部队在十月份反击战中获重大胜利全月歼敌六万三千多名
    击落击伤敌军飞机八百二十四架
    【新华社朝鲜前线十五日电】朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军在十月份的大规模的反击战中，获得了十三个月以来最大的战绩，全月共歼敌六万三千多人。这个数字约等于九月份歼敌总数的两倍，比一九五零年冬天第一、二两次战役歼灭敌人的总和还要多些。
    一个月来，朝中人民军队发起了一连串的反击战，在这些反击战中，规模最大战斗最剧烈的是发生在涟川西南、铁原西北、金城东南、北汉江东岸和文登以西等地区的战斗，其中以铁原西北药山洞附近的战斗最为剧烈。我军自六日晚攻占这地区的敌军阵地后，敌军即不断进行反扑，企图夺回阵地，剧烈的山头争夺战持续达九昼夜，我军在打退敌军反扑中大量杀伤敌人，共歼灭敌军八千多名，给予李伪军九师以极严重的打击，迫使敌人不得不把这个被打成残废了的部队撤下火线进行整补。这
    一个月的反击作战中，我军共计攻占敌军阵地五十八处，歼灭守敌两个整营、七个整连、四十四个整排；另有敌军两个连和九个排的大部被歼灭；我军在攻占敌军阵地后又在打退敌人反扑的战斗中大量杀伤了敌人。
    可是，屡遭惨败的敌人却异想天开地在这个月中旬发动了一个所谓自去年十月以来“最大的攻势”，企图集中兵力火力于一点，给我军压力，以便占点小便宜，来掩饰其失败。但是，事实恰与敌人的愿望相反，在这个“攻势”中，敌人所获得的是更加惨重的失败。敌人纠集美、伪军共两个师在数百门大炮、数十辆坦克及飞机的掩护下，自十四日开始向铁原东北至金化以北十多里长的一段战线上的我军八处阵地发动进攻，都被我守军先后击退。十五日以后敌人更集中向金化以北上甘岭附近我两座山岭阵地猛攻，我军在这两座山岭上展开了英勇的守备战。至十月底为止，我军在这两座山岭的守备战中，已歼敌一万二千多名，曾经被敌人占领过的地面工事的阵地都已收复。
    十月份的战况再一次证明：我军的战线不仅已经完全稳固，而且有充分的力量向敌人发起战术性的反击。这个月我军攻占的数十处敌军阵地中，就有十四处阵地为我军所控制。一个月来，由于我军加强了反击战，敌人已经陷于更加被动的境地。敌人由于缺乏后备兵力，只能拆东墙补西墙，因此自十月六日我军展开较大规模的反击战以后，敌人战线后方部队调动频繁。在我军连续打击下，敌军第二线部队的整补时间普遍缩短。在铁原西北药山洞地区受到严重打击的伪九师，撤下火线不过一周，就有一个团被急调至中线，以支持敌人上甘岭的所谓“攻势”。这种捉襟见肘的困难，是敌人无论如何也克服不了的。
    十月下半月，敌人在东西海岸曾进行四次窜扰，都被我军击退。
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在十月份作战中所获战果如下：
    一、歼灭敌军六万三千八百四十一名（其中包括炮兵部队进行炮战毙伤敌军六千五百一十九名，狙击手毙伤敌军四千六百六十二名），其中美军二万四千八百八十四名，英军三百二十二名，法军二百三十三名，加拿大军三百一十三名，李伪军三万八千零八十九名。
    二、主要缴获：各种炮五十一门，火焰喷射器三具，高射机枪二挺，轻重机枪四百七十二挺，各种枪二千七百八十八支，各种通讯器材二百三十七件。
    三、击落击伤敌军飞机八百二十四架，其中击落二百七十一架，击伤五百五十三架；击毁击伤敌军坦克一百二十八辆；击毁击伤敌军各种汽车一百一十九辆；击毁击伤敌军各种炮八十一门；击伤敌军驱逐舰一艘，击沉敌军登陆艇二艘。
