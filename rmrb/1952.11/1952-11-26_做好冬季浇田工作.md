    Do a Good Job of Winter Irrigation
    In most areas of the North, there is little rainfall in the spring, and its distribution is uneven, which affects the timely sowing and growth of crops. In order to overcome this difficulty, many areas are practicing winter irrigation with considerable success.
    Winter irrigation can increase wheat yields and ensure timely spring sowing next year. Because winter irrigation can maintain a certain temperature in the soil, protect wheat seedlings from frost damage, and promote fertilizer decomposition, making it easier for wheat to absorb. Land that has been winter-irrigated has loose soil after thawing in the spring, which is conducive to the development of wheat roots and allows it to quickly turn green and grow. Last year, the Xinxiang Prefecture Farm carried out winter irrigation on 3,000 mu of wheat fields, and the yield per mu increased by 30 jin compared with wheat fields that did not have winter irrigation, which is a very good example.
    Winter irrigation is also very beneficial for spring plowing and sowing. Last year, many areas in Shanxi and Chahar carried out winter irrigation on bare land. In the spring, due to the sufficient moisture in the soil, spring sowing was successfully completed.
    The time for winter irrigation should be determined according to the climate of each region, and it should not be too early or too late. Areas that already have the habit of winter irrigation should seize the opportunity to carry out winter irrigation. Areas that do not yet have the habit of winter irrigation must absorb the experience of areas that already have the habit of winter irrigation, break conservative thinking, and carry out winter irrigation in order to strive for a bumper wheat harvest next year and ensure the smooth completion of spring sowing.

    做好冬季浇田工作
    北方大部地区，春季雨量稀少，而且分配不匀，影响农作物适时下种和生长。为了克服这一困难，有不少地区实行冬季浇田，颇有成效。
    冬季浇田可以使小麦增加产量，并能保证来年春季及时播种。因为冬季浇田可以保持土壤的一定温度，保护麦苗不致冻坏，同时可以促进肥料分解，便于小麦吸取。实行冬季浇田的土地，在春季解冻后，土壤疏松，利于小麦的根系发育，能使其迅速复青生长。新乡专区农场去年冬季在三千亩小麦田中实行冬浇，每亩比没有实行冬浇的麦地增产三十斤，就是很好的例子。
    冬季浇田对于春耕播种的好处也是很大的。去年山西、察哈尔很多地区，在白茬地上进行冬浇，到来年春季因土壤中有充分的水份，保证了春播顺利完成。
    冬浇时间应根据各地气候而定，不宜过早，也不宜过迟。已有冬浇习惯的地区，应抓紧时机进行冬浇，尚无冬浇习惯的地区，必须吸收已有冬浇习惯地区的经验，打破保守思想，进行冬浇，以争取来年小麦的丰产和保证春播顺利完成。
