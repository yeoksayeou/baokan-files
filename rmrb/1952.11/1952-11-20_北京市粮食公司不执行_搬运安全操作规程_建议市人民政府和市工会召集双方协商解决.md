To the Editors:

    The leading cadres of the Beijing Branch of the China Grain Company have long neglected the policy of safe production, holding seriously flawed, one-sided views on production. Following the criticism in your "Letters from Readers" column on July 9th and September 3rd regarding the Beijing Transportation Company, Beijing Grain Company, and other units neglecting worker safety and hygiene, resulting in serious illness, injury, and death, the Grain Company still hasn't taken it seriously. This erroneous attitude of disregarding Party newspaper criticism cannot be tolerated.

    To increase warehouse capacity, the Grain Company has consistently stacked goods too high (25 bags of flour high), frequently causing collapses and worker injuries. According to incomplete statistics, in 1951 alone, the Xizhimen warehouse had over twenty major accidents involving workers being crushed. Loading worker Zhang Baohua suffered a fractured hip due to a collapsing stack, and worker Wang Baoquan injured his ribs. Other workers have coughed up blood or fainted; head and foot injuries are even more common. However, the workers’ injuries and blood have not attracted the attention of the Grain Company's leadership, whose slogan remains "Occupy the Sky, Not the Land," believing it's a good way to increase production. This extremely erroneous, single-minded emphasis on production has led them to disregard the lives and safety of the workers.

    To address the Party newspaper's criticism and improve the safe production conditions for transport workers, the Beijing Transportation Company, in coordination with the trade union, conducted a comprehensive inspection of tools and lighting equipment throughout the company. After over two months of research, they formulated "Safe Handling Operating Procedures." We believe that implementing these new operating procedures will not only ensure worker safety but also improve work efficiency. On September 18th, the Joint Office for Safe Production of the Transportation Company convened a meeting of administrative cadres from various professional companies in Beijing to solicit their opinions on the new procedures. Most company representatives agreed to a trial implementation; only the representative of the Storage and Transportation Section of the Beijing Grain Company strongly opposed it. The reason given was that the "Safe Handling Operating Procedures" reduced the stacking height of flour bags from 25 to 22 bags and shortened the distance workers carried grain bags from 20-30 *zhang* to 12 *zhang*, stipulating that distances exceeding 12 *zhang* should be handled by carts or workers taking turns carrying the bags. We made these provisions to effectively prevent worker injuries and deaths by appropriately reducing the stacking height and shortening the manual carrying distance. However, the leading cadres of the Beijing Grain Company believe that this wastes warehouse capacity and labor. To consider the Grain Company's views, we conducted on-site inspections and measurements, proving that the workers' proposed stacking height of 22 flour bags is fully consistent with the former Central Trade Department's regulations regarding warehouse capacity, which specified a stacking height of 3.3 meters.

    On September 29th, the Joint Office for Safe Production convened another meeting of various professional companies in Beijing, unanimously passing the "Safe Handling Operating Procedures." After the Grain Company trialed it for only a few days, they raised different opinions. On November 12th, the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce convened a meeting to negotiate a solution. At that time, worker representatives raised many suggestions to the Beijing Grain Company and exposed many of the company's unreasonable work systems. Comrade Duan Tingmei, the person in charge of the company, while acknowledging that the workers' opinions were correct, still disagreed with reducing the stacking height and shortening the working distance. Thus, our "Safe Handling Operating Procedures" could not be implemented in the Beijing Grain Company.

    Why are the leading cadres of the Beijing Grain Company unwilling to implement the "Safe Handling Operating Procedures"? Because they fundamentally fail to understand the work hazards and health damage that excessive stacking height and working distance bring to the workers. Loading workers in the Beijing Grain Company each carry grain bags weighing over 200 *jin* for 20-30 *zhang*, leaving them exhausted all day, their backs aching so much they can't straighten up, and unable to turn over when lying down. Many workers suffer from "cold leg" syndrome. They have never cared about the workers' suffering. Even during the trial implementation of the new procedures, the leading cadres of the Xizhimen Grain Depot used disguised methods to resist. They deliberately had workers carry grain bags 12 *zhang* to form a stack, cover it with matting, and then dismantle it the next day and transport it to another location 12 *zhang* away, even repeating this process two or three times before finally reaching the storage location. They would rather waste the workers' labor and consume state property than use carts. Lu Wenguang, the manager of the depot, pointed at the workers and asked, "Do you know why we're doing this?" It is clear this was retaliation against the workers.

    Furthermore, your criticism on July 9th pointed out the erroneous phenomenon of endangering worker safety due to a lack of tools and lighting equipment. On July 27th, we suggested to various professional companies to add and repair tools and lighting equipment. Zhao Guoen, the Chief of Storage and Transportation Section of Beijing Grain Company, fully agreed at the time, but this has not been fully resolved to this day. Particularly egregious is the fact that the person in charge of the Yongdingmen Grain Warehouse treated the workers' legitimate demands with deception. When the loading workers requested the addition of ditch covers, the responsible comrade of the warehouse purchased rotten wooden boards to appease the workers, resulting in worker Li Xiuqing being injured. They never proactively inspect the lack of tools and equipment; when workers make requests, they refuse to accept them. This time, the workers requested more ladders, but they insisted there were 116 ladders. After inspection, there were only 45 ladders, and only three of them were usable. They treat the workers with such an extremely serious bureaucratic attitude. We request the People's Daily to expose these egregious phenomena and urge the Beijing Grain Company to accept the workers' demands and implement the new "Safe Handling Operating Procedures" to ensure the lives and safety of transport workers.

                     Shang Zhenyuan, Chairman of the Yongdingmen District Committee
                     Fu Wenxiang, Chairman of the Xizhimen District Committee of the Trade Union of the Beijing Transportation Company
                     Zuo Lianshan, Chairman of the Xibianmen District Committee
                     Representing all loading workers

    Editor's Note: The policy of safe production must be implemented. This is one of the fundamental differences between a New Democratic society and a capitalist society in their treatment of workers. The Beijing Transportation Company's acceptance of reader criticism, in-depth inspection of the safe production conditions for handling workers in coordination with the trade union, and the mobilization of workers to formulate "Safe Handling Operating Procedures" are completely correct approaches. As to whether the specific content of the procedures is entirely appropriate, we suggest that the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, the Labor Bureau, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions be responsible for convening a meeting of the Transportation Company, the Grain Company, and the Handling Workers' Union, with the participation of representatives of the handling workers, to specifically resolve the matter.

### 北京市粮食公司不执行“搬运安全操作规程”  建议市人民政府和市工会召集双方协商解决

    北京市粮食公司不执行“搬运安全操作规程”
    建议市人民政府和市工会召集双方协商解决
    编辑同志：中国粮食公司北京分公司的领导干部，长期忽视安全生产的方针，存在着严重的片面生产的错误观点。七月九日及九月三日，你们“读者来信专页”先后批评了北京市运输公司、北京市粮食公司等单位忽视工人安全卫生，以致造成严重的疾病伤亡事故之后，仍然没有引起粮食公司的重视，这种漠视党报批评的错误态度，也是不能允许的。
    粮食公司为了增加仓库的容量，一贯是码垛过高
    （二十五袋面粉高），以致经常发生坍塌伤人事故。据不完全统计，一九五一年仅西直门仓库就发生了二十多次砸伤工人的重大事故。装卸工人张宝华因粮垛坍塌而砸碎了跨骨，工人王宝全也因此砸伤了肋骨，还有的工人被砸得吐血或晕过去；至于砸破头、碰破脚的事情更是经常发生。但是，工人的伤和血并没有引起粮食公司负责人的注意，他们的口号仍然是“占天不占地”，认为这样是提高生产的好方法。这种极端错误的单纯强调生产的观点，使得他们已经把工人们的生命安全置于脑后了。
    北京市运输公司为了接受党报的批评，改善运输工人的安全生产条件，协同工会曾在全公司进行了工具、照明设备的大检查，并广泛组织工人讨论，经过两个多月的研究，订出了“搬运安全操作规程”。我们认为，如果实行了这个新的操作规程，不仅可以保障工人的生产安全，而且还能够提高工作效率。九月十八日，运输公司安全生产联合办公室召集北京市各专业公司行政干部开会，征求他们对新规程的意见。大多数公司代表都同意试行；只有北京市粮食公司代表储运科科长坚决反对。原因是，“搬运安全操作规程”中把面粮码垛的高度由二十五个面粉袋降为二十二个面粉袋；把工人扛粮包所走的工作距离由二、三十丈远缩短到十二丈远，并规定凡超过十二丈远的距离一律用车子搬送或由工人倒换着扛。我们所以这样规定，是因为适当地降低码垛的高度和缩短人力搬运的距离，可以有效地防止工人伤亡事故。但是，北京市粮食公司的领导干部却认为这样做浪费了仓库容量和劳动力。为了考虑粮食公司的意见，会后我们到现场进行了检查和测量，证明工人们提出来的二十二个面粉袋的码垛高度和前中央贸易部关于仓库容量的规定中码垛三·三米的高度是完全一致的。
    九月二十九日，安全生产联合办公室又召集北京市各专业公司开会，一致通过了“搬运安全操作规程”。粮食公司试行了没有几天，他们又提出了不同的意见。十一月十二日，由市工商局召开会议协商解决这个问题，当时工人代表们向北京市粮食公司提了不少意见，并揭露了该公司很多不合理的工作制度；该公司负责人段廷美同志一方面认为工人们的意见是对的，另方面他仍然不同意降低码垛高度和缩短工作距离。就这样，我们所订的“搬运安全操作规程”，在北京市粮食公司没法贯彻了。
    北京市粮食公司的领导干部为什么不肯实行“搬运安全操作规程”呢？因为他们根本不了解码垛过高和工作距离过远给工人们带来的工作危险性及损害身体健康的恶果。在北京市粮食公司工作的装卸工人，每人都是扛着二百多斤重的粮包一走就是二、三十丈远，整天累的精疲力尽，腰痛得直不起来，躺下来就翻不了身，很多工人都害了“寒腿”症。对于工人们的疾苦，他们从没有过问过。甚至在试行新规程的期间，西直门粮库的领导干部还采用变相的办法进行抵抗。他们有意让工人把粮包扛到十二丈远的地方垛成一个货位用席苫好，第二天再拆开运到另一个十二丈远的地方，甚至连倒两三次最后才达到保管的地方。他们宁肯这样浪费工人的劳动力和消耗国家财产，也不肯用车子运。该库管理员卢文光指着工人问：“你们知道为什么这样做？”很明显这是对工人的报复。
    此外，七月九日你们发表的批评中，曾指责了那些因缺乏工具和照明设备违害工人安全的错误现象。我们在七月二十七日即向各专业公司提出添置和修理工具及照明设备的建议，北京市粮食公司储运科科长赵国恩当时满口答应，但至今仍没有全部解决。尤其恶劣的，是永定门粮食仓库负责人竟以欺骗的态度对待工人的正当要求。当装卸工人提出添置盖沟板时，该库负责同志就买了糟烂了的木板去应付工人，结果摔伤了工人李秀清。他们从不主动检查工具和设备的缺乏情况；当工人提出要求时，他们又不接受。这次工人提出梯子不够用，他们却硬说有一百一十六把梯子，经过检查，只有四十五把梯子，而且其中仅有三把能用。他们就这样以极端严重的官僚主义态度去对待工人的。我们要求人民日报揭发这些恶劣的现象，并督促北京市粮食公司接受工人的要求，执行新的“搬运安全操作规程”，以保障运输工人的生命和安全。
                  永定门区委会主席尚振元北京市运输公司工会西直门区委会主席富文祥
                  西便门区委会主席左连山
                  代表全体装卸工人
    编者按：安全生产的方针必须贯彻。这是新民主主义社会与资本主义社会对待工人的根本区别之一。北京市运输公司接受读者批评，协同工会深入检查搬运工人的安全生产条件，发动工人制订了“搬运安全操作规程”，这种做法是完全正确的。至于规程内各项具体内容是否完全恰当，我们建议北京市人民政府工商局、劳动局、市总工会负责召集运输公司、粮食公司和搬运工会开会协商，并吸收搬运工人代表参加，具体解决。
