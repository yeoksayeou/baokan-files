    关于调整省、区建制的决议
    （一九五二年十一月十五日中央人民政府委员会第十九次会议通过）
    为调整现有省、区建制，以利工作起见，兹决定：
    一、撤销平原省建制。现属平原省原为山东省旧辖之高唐、清平、博平、茌平、聊城、堂邑、冠县、莘县、朝城、阳谷、东阿、梁山、寿张、范县、观城、濮县、鄄城、郓城、南旺、嘉祥、钜野、菏泽、定陶、城武、金乡、鱼台、单县、复程、曹县等二十九县，全部划回山东省属；原为河南省旧辖之林县、安阳、邺县、内黄、汤阴、浚县、滑县、淇县、汲县、辉县、新乡、延津、封邱、原阳、获嘉、修武、武陟、博爱、温县、沁阳、孟县、济源等二十二县，新乡、安阳两市及焦作工矿区，全部划回河南省属；原为河北省旧辖之南乐、清丰、濮阳、东明、长垣等五县，为治黄之便，亦划归河南省属，不再归回河北省；现属河北省原为河南省旧辖之武安、涉县、临漳三县不动，仍属河北省，以利治漳。
    二、撤销察哈尔省建制。现属察哈尔省原为山西旧辖之朔县、平鲁、左云、右玉、怀仁、山阴、应县、大同、浑源、灵邱、广灵、阳高、天镇等十三县及大同市划回山西省属；原为河北省旧辖之赤城、龙关、延庆、怀来、宣化、涿鹿、万全、怀安、阳原、蔚县等十县，张家口、宣化二市及察北的崇礼、张北、沽源、康保、尚义、商都等六县，均划归河北省属。
    三、成立江苏省人民政府，并于该省人民政府成立后，撤销苏北人民行政公署、苏南人民行政公署。现属山东省、安徽省原为江苏省旧辖之地区，均划回江苏省属。江苏省人民政府设于南京。
    四、河北与山东两省过去在毗连地区互划的县份，应归还原建制。即现属山东省原为河北省旧辖之盐山、庆云、南皮、东光、吴桥、宁津等六县划回河北省属；现属河北省原为山东省旧辖之恩县、武城、夏津、临清、馆陶、邱县等六县，除邱县系全部飞地因领导便利仍留河北省外，其余五县均划回山东省属。
