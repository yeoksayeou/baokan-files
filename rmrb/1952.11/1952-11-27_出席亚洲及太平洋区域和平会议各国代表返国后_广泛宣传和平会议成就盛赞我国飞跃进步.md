The Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the Mongolian government organ "Truth Daily" successively published the resolutions of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference in prominent positions on October 22nd, 23rd, and 24th. The photo exhibition introducing the actual situation and great achievements of the Peace Conference, sponsored by the Mongolian Committee for the Defense of Peace, also opened on October 25th at the Nyerjve Uchirbu National Cinema in Ulaanbaatar.

In Pakistan, a mass meeting of women from all walks of life was held in Lahore on November 11th. Tahira Mazhar, a delegate who attended the Peace Conference, conveyed the achievements of the Peace Conference at the meeting. She pointed out the threat of war to women and children and called on women to actively participate in the peace movement. Finally, the meeting passed a resolution demanding a halt to wars of aggression, banning atomic and bacteriological weapons, and calling on women to unite to defend peace. Prior to this meeting, another mass meeting was held in Lahore on the 9th.

The delegates of various countries are determined to bring this will back to their own countries and persist in it among their own people.

He said: It is glorious and worthy of pride to be a Chinese!

He then took out the silver pagoda, gold Buddha statue, and Buddhist scriptures presented by the Buddhists of Beijing to the Burmese delegation for the welcomers to see and said: The American imperialists' fabrication of the rumor that "China has no religious freedom" is a trick to deceive children.

On the 12th, the Burmese delegation to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held a press conference in Yangon. U Ba Yin, the secretary-general of the delegation, praised the spirit of representatives from many countries, such as the United States and Japan, who bravely attended the meeting despite the obstruction of reactionary governments. He then reported on the contents of the eleven resolutions of the Peace Conference and especially introduced the respect expressed by the delegates of various countries to the Korean delegates at the Peace Conference. He also introduced the situation when the representatives of India and Pakistan signed the joint statement on the peaceful settlement of the Kashmir issue.

At the press conference, the Burmese representatives also reported on their impressions of New China. Representative Wu La said: I have visited Chinese cities and villages twice and deeply feel that the Chinese people are not complacent with their current life of abundance, but are striving for higher ideals. Finally, Deqin Kodomai, head of the delegation, told the reporters present: "China is a peace-loving country and is making progress year by year. Therefore, I hope that reporters can responsibly report this truth to the Burmese people."

    据新华社讯：蒙古保卫和平委员会正在广泛宣传亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的巨大成就，委员会已决定进行以下活动：一、全国报纸刊载和平会议的各项决议和宣言等文件；二、出席和平会议的代表们到各工厂和学校作报告；三、出席和平会议的代表撰写关于介绍和平会议的重大意义和介绍中国和平建设成就的文章。
    蒙古人民革命党中央委员会和蒙古政府机关报“真理报”已在十月二十二、二十三、二十四日陆续在显著地位刊载了亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议各项决议。蒙古保卫和平委员会主办的介绍和平会议的实况与巨大成就的照片展览，也在十月二十五日起在乌兰巴托的尼尔杰布奥其尔布国家电影院开幕。
    在巴基斯坦，十一月十一日在拉合尔举行了有各阶层妇女参加的妇女群众大会，出席和平会议的代表塔希拉·马兹哈在大会上传达了和平会议的成就。她指出战争对妇女和儿童的威胁，号召妇女积极参加和平运动。最后大会通过决议，要求停止侵略战争、禁止原子和细菌武器、号召妇女团结起来保卫和平。在这个大会之前，拉合尔曾在九日举行了另一次群众大会，出席和平会议的代表穆罕默德·拉希德和修格特·哈雅特·汗等多人都在大会上发表演说，他们指出：只要人民团结起来，就可以维护世界和平。
    十一月十三日，出席和平会议的巴基斯坦代表团团长沙里夫向报界发表谈话，他介绍了和平会议的巨大成就，并对“关于民族独立问题的决议”和关于克什米尔问题的印度与巴基斯坦代表团联合声明作了说明。
    缅甸和平代表团团长德钦哥都迈在十一日乘飞机抵达仰光时，在机场对记者谈这次参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的感想，他说：这次会议非常成功，因为它集中了亚洲及太平洋区域人民的和平意志。各国代表都有决心把这种意志带回本国，在本国人民中再坚持下去。德钦哥都迈在谈到他对新中国的观感时说：在伟大的领袖毛泽东主席领导下的中国人民，目前不仅已过着丰衣足食和夜不闭户的生活，而且正在为实现更美好的理想而飞跃地前进着。他说：作为中国人是光荣和值得骄傲的！

    在记者招待会上，缅甸代表们并分别报告了对新中国的观感。代表吴拉说：我先后两次参观了中国的城市和乡村，深感中国人民并不因今天丰衣足食的生活而自满，他们在为更高的理想而努力。最后，代表团团长德钦哥都迈告诉到会的记者们说：“中国是爱好和平的国家，一年比一年进步，因此我希望记者能负责把这真相报道给缅甸人民。”
