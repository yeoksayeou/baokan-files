    Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    Inspection of the "Shuang He Cheng" Case by the Beijing Municipal People's Court

    To the Editor: We have seen the opinions of readers Wen Junfeng, Li Zhongsheng, and others in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on September 3 regarding the handling of the private merchant "Shuang He Cheng's" breach of contract case by the Thirteenth District Trial Court of the Suburban People's Court of Beijing. This has greatly helped promote our court's judicial reform movement, and we are very grateful.

    On September 4, we sent people to the Thirteenth District Trial Court to inspect the handling of the case, and together with staff from the local police station and the street people's government, we conducted a comprehensive understanding at Tsinghua University. The personnel handling the case in the trial court lacked investigation and research, and did not have sufficient understanding of the merchant's failure to fulfill the contract to hand over the house on time and Tsinghua University's urgent need for housing. Therefore, they failed to handle it in a timely manner, and it was delayed for more than two months without results. As for what the readers said in their letter, "asking the Tsinghua University Cooperative to buy all the equipment and utensils of 'Shuang He Cheng'," in reality, the case had never been sentenced in this way. In addition to urging the court to handle it quickly and correctly, we also ordered the personnel handling the case to conduct a deep self-criticism.  Beijing Municipal People's Court

    Editor's Note: According to a communication with the Beijing Municipal People's Court on September 22, the case has been finally processed. The Thirteenth District Trial Court ordered the private merchant "Shuang He Cheng" to move out of Tsinghua University within one month.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    北京市人民法院对“双合成”案的检查
    编辑同志：在九月三日人民日报“读者来信”栏中，读者温俊峰、李仲生等对北京市郊区人民法院十三区审判庭处理私商“双合成”不履行合同案提出的意见，我们看到了。这对推动我院的司法改革运动有很大的帮助，我们十分感谢。
    九月四日我们派人到十三区审判庭检查该案处理情况，并会同当地派出所、街人民政府的工作人员到清华大学作全面了解。该审判庭承办人员，对该案的处理缺乏调查研究，对商人不履行合同按期交房及对清华大学急于用房的情况不够了解，所以没能及时处理，拖延了两个多月仍无结果。至读者来信所说，“叫清华大学合作社收买‘双合成’的一切设备用具等”，实际上该案并没有这样宣判过。我们除督促该庭迅速正确处理外，并责成承办人员作深刻检讨。    北京市人民法院
    编者按：据九月二十二日和北京市人民法院
    联系，该案已经最后处理，十三区审判庭判令
    私商“双合成”于一月内搬出清华大学。
