    Adhere to the Active and Prudent Party Building Policy
    Experiences from various regions prove that significant achievements have been made wherever party building work has been conducted according to the central Party's building policy, with planning, leadership, and preparation. This is the main situation of party building work nationwide. Conversely, mistakes are certain to occur. The party building work in Xinhua County, Hunan, published in today's newspaper is an example.
    The party building work in Xinhua County, Hunan, was not carried out resolutely according to the central policy after studying and understanding the central Party's building policy. Therefore, at the beginning of the work, it showed excessive "prudence," being overly cautious and not daring to actively carry out the work of developing the Party. After the higher-level Party criticized this, it was mistakenly believed that the central government's active and prudent party-building policy had changed, and the opposition to closed-doorism was misinterpreted as being able to "boldly let go," the opposition to the mystification of the standards for party members was misinterpreted as lowering the standards for party members, and the requirement to actively complete party-building tasks was misinterpreted as being able to use any means to meet quotas. In this way, regardless of the situation, it was blindly determined to develop 50 percent of the people in the third training class into the Party, and in this training class alone, as many as 24.7 percent were of poor quality. As a result, when accepting new party members, the standards for party members were lowered. It was even clearly known that some people had low class consciousness and did not yet meet the conditions for joining the Party, but in the end, the opinions of the district cadres on lowering the conditions for accepting them into the Party were approved, because "the task would not be completed otherwise."
    The above facts point out to us the importance of studying and understanding the central Party's building policy. The leading cadres of the Xinhua County Party Committee did not study and understand the central Party's building policy well, so they either made excessive demands or lowered the standards for party members; they were either overly "prudent" or overly "active." They did not understand that the central government's active and prudent party-building policy is a complete policy. The reason for being active is that after a series of mass movements, a group of outstanding people have emerged from the workers and working people. They have good backgrounds, high awareness, clear history, are loyal to the Party, actively participate in mass struggles, work, production, and learning, understand the significance of the Party's cause, and are willing to fight for the Party's cause. After investigating and educating them, the Party should actively rather than passively absorb them into the Party to expand the Party's organization and enhance the Party's leadership role over the people and national construction. Because it is precisely such a group of outstanding people who should be absorbed into the Party, and not anyone else, a prudent attitude must be adopted. The Xinhua County Party Committee did not understand the Party's building policy, so it generated a purely task-oriented perspective and lowered the standards for party members to accept them.
    Judging from the current situation, the numbers for completing the originally planned party building plans in various regions are not a problem. The problem lies in how to adhere to the standards for party members and ensure the quality of the party members accepted. And the key to adhering to the standards for party members lies in whether we can adhere to the central Party's building policy and carry out party building work in a planned, led, and prepared manner. Any hasty and careless approach will repeat the serious mistake of lowering the standards for party members in the party building work in Xinhua County, Hunan.

### 坚持积极的慎重的建党方针

    坚持积极的慎重的建党方针
    各地经验证明：凡按照中央建党方针，有计划、有领导、有准备地进行建党工作，都取得了很大的成绩。这是目前全国建党工作的主要情况。反之，一定会发生错误。今天本报所刊登的湖南新化县的建党工作就是一个例子。
    湖南新化县的建党工作，不是在学习和领会了中央的建党方针之后，坚决按照中央方针去进行的。因此工作开始时，表现了过分的“慎重”，束手束脚，不敢积极地进行发展党的工作。在上级党对此进行批判之后，又以为中央的积极、慎重的建党方针有了改变，把反对关门主义倾向误解为可以“大胆放手”，把反对对党员标准的神秘化误解为党员标准的降低，把要求积极完成建党任务误解为可以不择手段，拉夫凑数。这样，就不问情况，盲目地确定了在第三期训练班中发展百分之五十的人入党，而在这一期训练班中，单是品质恶劣者就有百分之二十四点七之多。结果在接收新党员时，降低党员标准，甚至明明知道有一部分人阶级觉悟低，尚未具备入党条件，但最后却批准了区干部的降低条件接收入党的意见，因为“不这样就完不成任务”。
    上述的事实，给我们指出了学习和领会中央建党方针的重要性。新化县党的领导干部就因为没有很好地学习和领会中央的建党方针，所以不是提出过高的要求，就是降低了党员标准；不是过分“慎重”，就是过分“积极”。他们不了解中央的积极、慎重的建党方针，是一个完整的方针。所以要积极的原因是：经过一系列的群众运动之后，已从工人和劳动人民中涌现了一批优秀人物。他们成分好，觉悟高，历史清楚，对党忠诚，在群众斗争及工作、生产和学习中表现积极，懂得党的事业的意义，并愿为党的事业奋斗。经过对他们的考察和教育之后，党应该积极地而不是消极地吸收他们入党，以扩大党的组织，增强党对人民群众和国家建设的领导作用。因为应该吸收入党的就是要这样一批优秀人物，而不是其他什么人，所以必须采取慎重的态度。新化县委不了解党的建党方针，就产生了单纯任务观点，降低党员标准去接收党员。
    从目前情况来看，各地完成原定的建党计划的数字是不成问题的。问题就在于如何坚持党员标准、保证所接收的党员的质量。而坚持党员标准的关键，就在于能否坚持中央的建党方针，有计划、有领导、有准备地进行建党工作。任何急于求成，草率从事的作法，都将重复湖南新化县在建党工作中降低党员标准的严重错误。
