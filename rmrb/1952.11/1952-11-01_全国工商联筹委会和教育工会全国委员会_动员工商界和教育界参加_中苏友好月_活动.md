    Xinhua News Agency report: The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee and the National Committee of the Educational Workers' Union of China have issued notices to mobilize industrial, commercial, and educational workers across the country to actively participate in the activities of "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month."
    The notice from the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee calls on local federations of industry and commerce to use various forms of publicity to promote the great achievements of Soviet socialist and communist construction to the broad masses of industrialists and businessmen, to clarify the great significance of Sino-Soviet friendship, and to mobilize and organize local industrialists and businessmen to actively participate in various activities of "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." All publications of local federations of industry and commerce should focus on promoting Sino-Soviet friendship as the central content during this period. At the same time, they should organize relevant articles for local newspapers and periodicals as much as possible to expand publicity. Local federations of industry and commerce should take the initiative to contact and cooperate with local Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations and relevant units to actively participate in various tasks of "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." They can also combine this with the notice issued on October 15 regarding studying the great achievements of the motherland over the past three years and the Asian and Pacific Region Peace Conference, and arrange for study. At the same time, they should encourage industrialists and businessmen to learn and promote advanced Soviet experience to facilitate production reform and improve technology, and widely mobilize industrialists and businessmen to join the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.
    The notice from the National Committee of the Educational Workers' Union of China calls on local educational workers' unions to mobilize educational workers who have not yet joined the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association to actively participate in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and to mobilize the masses to enthusiastically participate in activities organized by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association during "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." Based on the materials issued by the head office of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and newspapers, the notice aims to introduce the great achievements of various Soviet constructions to the broad masses of students and the general public, and use concrete facts to illustrate the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union to China, and to educate the masses about the future of socialism and communism. During "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," local grassroots organizations of educational workers' unions, especially grassroots organizations in rural areas, should use the spare time of the masses to invite students' parents and the public to schools for discussions. Through these discussions, they should introduce the advanced Soviet construction experience and call on farmers to learn Soviet agricultural production technology, improve agricultural production, and increase yields per unit area. At the same time, it is necessary to mobilize all educational workers to systematically and regularly study advanced Soviet educational theories and teaching methods, improve teaching, and learn from the experience of Soviet educational workers in educating the younger generation with the spirit of patriotism and internationalism.
