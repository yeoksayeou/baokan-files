    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: U.S. authorities are vigorously intensifying espionage activities in Japan in order to maintain their control over Japan and make Japan one of the centers for U.S. espionage activities in Asia. The U.S. "Ambassador" to Japan, Murphy, is a major special agent dispatched to Japan by the U.S. State Department, and he has already established a network of spies throughout Japan. In addition to Murphy's espionage system, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency has also secretly established an intelligence agency called "GRS" within the U.S. Embassy in Japan, specializing in collecting intelligence on the Soviet Union, China, and Japanese progressive organizations, as well as monitoring the dynamics of Japanese political and financial circles. This intelligence agency instructed the Yoshida government to establish a Cabinet Investigation Office, dispatching agents to infiltrate trade unions and other areas, and buying newspapers and radio stations to serve its anti-communist and war-mongering propaganda.

    美国在日本加强间谍活动
    【新华社十六日讯】东京消息：美国当局正在日本极力加强间谍活动，以维持它对日本的统治，并使日本成为美国在亚洲进行间谍活动的中心之一。美国驻日“大使”墨菲就是美国国务院派驻日本的一个大特务头子，他已在日本各处布下了间谍网。除了墨菲的间谍系统之外，美国中央情报局还在美国驻日大使馆内另行设立一个名为“GRS”局的秘密谍报机关，专事搜集苏联、中国和日本进步组织的情报，并侦察日本政界和财政界的动态。这个谍报机关指使吉田政府成立了内阁调查室，派遣特务打进工会和其它方面，并收买报纸和广播电台，来为它的反共和煽动战争的宣传服务。
