    The Soviet Color Film "Hero of Labor" Educated Me and Made Me Realize My Mistakes

    Editor: After watching the Soviet color film "Hero of Labor," I was deeply moved by the protagonist, Serazh, and his spirit of fighting to the end for the collective cause. Every plot point and every shot in the film provided me with great education.

    I am a person with backward thinking. I have serious individualistic thoughts, like vanity, care about face-saving, and have ideas about fame, fortune, and status. In my past work, I have always been perfunctory and afraid of taking responsibility. In 1951, when I was working as an administrator, I couldn't get my head around it at first. I felt that this kind of work had no "future," no fame, and no status. Letting me do this kind of work was a "waste of talent." My thoughts were always circling around personal interests such as treatment and enjoyment. Every day I was pessimistic, disappointed, and moody. I completely forgot about the interests of the Party and the interests of the people. Although I sometimes worked enthusiastically, it was also with impure personal motives. If my thinking had continued to develop like this, there would have been a danger of detachment from the revolution. After watching "Hero of Labor," Serazh's high degree of enthusiasm for being loyal to the people and loyal to the cause of communism made me unable to help but painfully ask myself: "You treat your work perfunctorily and carelessly, only thinking about personal fame, fortune, and status. Aren't you ashamed when you compare yourself to Serazh?" The more I thought about it, the more ashamed I became. This film seemed like a mirror, reflecting my bad thoughts and pointing out the direction I should strive for in my life. In the future, I will definitely work hard to correct my mistakes, transform myself, and become a loyal soldier of the people.

    苏联彩色影片“金星英雄”教育我认识了错误
    编辑同志：我看了苏联彩色影片“金星英雄”以后，我深深为主人公谢拉杰的为集体事业而奋斗到底的精神所感动，影片的每一情节，每一镜头，都给我很大的教育。
    我是一个思想落后的人，我有着严重的个人主义思想，好虚荣，爱面子，有名利、地位观念。我在过去的工作中，一贯是敷衍了事，怕负责任。一九五一年我作管理员工作时，最初思想上搞不通，认为这种工作没“前途”，没名望，没地位，让我作这种工作，是“大材小用”了。我的思想总在待遇、享受等个人利益上打圈子，每天悲观、失望、闹情绪。根本把党的利益、人民的利益丢到脑后去了。有时虽然也热情地工作过，但那也是怀着不纯的个人动机。我的这种思想如果发展下去，会有脱离革命的危险。我看了“金星英雄”后，谢拉杰忠于人民，忠于共产主义事业的高度热情，使我不能不痛切地责问自己：“你敷衍了事，粗枝大叶地对待工作，只为个人的名利、地位着想，你和谢拉杰比比不觉羞惭吗？”我心里越想越惭愧，这部影片好像一面镜子照出了我的坏思想，给我指出了我一生应努力的方向。我今后一定努力改正错误，改造自己，作一个忠实的人民战士。
