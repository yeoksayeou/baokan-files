    With the selfless assistance of Soviet friends
    China's Changchun Railway Jincheng Line is restored and officially opened ahead of schedule
    [Report from this newspaper] The Jincheng Line of the China Changchun Railway (from Jin County to Chengzi Tuan), with the strong assistance of Soviet friends, was completely restored ahead of schedule and officially opened to traffic on November 22. On the eve of the transfer of the China Changchun Railway to our country, Soviet friends are still vigorously helping our country to build this railway, which is another example of the selfless assistance of the Soviet people to our country.
    The Jincheng Line is a branch line of the China Changchun Railway. It is 102 kilometers long from Jin County to Chengzi Tuan. During the Liberation War, the Kuomintang reactionaries destroyed the tracks, bridges, and all equipment of the Xing Shutun to Chengzi Tuan section in 1946. The Dalian Branch of the China Changchun Railway Administration, according to the order of the Administration Director Grunichev, started construction on October 15 and, with the strong help of Soviet experts, completely restored the section by November 16, nine days ahead of schedule, and officially opened it to traffic on November 22. The entire restoration project included 46.5 kilometers of railway, 119 large and small bridges and culverts, and all station buildings and various equipment along the line.
    The restoration of this railway has great economic significance. The area along the railway from Xing Shutun to Chengzi Tuan is a rich salt and fishery production area along the Yellow Sea coast. The salt production in this area accounts for one-quarter of the total salt production in Northeast China. The quality of the salt is also particularly good and is most suitable for use as a raw material in the chemical industry. The fishery production of the Changshan Islands and the local coastal area is also very rich. After the restoration of this railway section, these fishery and salt products, as well as local agricultural products, can be transported and sold to other places in a timely manner. This is of great benefit to the large-scale economic construction that is about to begin.
    The opening ceremony was held at Xing Shutun Station on November 22. Han Guang, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Lüda Municipal Committee and Mayor of the Lüda Municipal People's Government, spoke at the meeting, congratulating the full opening of the Jincheng Line and thanking the Soviet experts for their help. Mass rallies were held at stations along the line to celebrate the opening and to thank Soviet friends.

    在苏联友人无私的援助下
    中国长春铁路金城线提前修复正式通车
    【本报讯】中国长春铁路金城线（金县至城子疃），在苏联友人大力援助下，提前全部修复，于十一月二十二日正式通车。苏联友人在中国长春铁路即将移交我国的前夕，仍大力帮助我国修建这段铁路，这是苏联人民对我国无私援助的又一事例。
    金城线是中国长春铁路所属的一条支线。从金县到城子疃，全长一百零二公里。解放战争时期，国民党反动派在一九四六年将杏树屯至城子疃一段的路轨、桥梁和所有设备都破坏了。中国长春铁路管理局大连分局根据管理局局长格鲁尼切夫的命令，于十月十五日动工，进行修建工作，在苏联专家大力帮助下，到十一月十六日，较计划提前九天，将该段全部修复，并于十一月二十二日正式通车。全部修复工程，包括四十六公里半铁路，一百一十九处大小桥梁和涵洞，及沿线所有站舍和各种设备。
    这一段铁路的修复，在经济上有很大意义。从杏树屯到城子疃的铁路沿线一带，是黄海沿岸富饶的盐、渔产区。这一带盐的产量占东北产盐总量的四分之一。盐的质量也特别好，最适于作化学工业原料。长山列岛和当地沿海一带的渔产也很丰富。此段铁路修复后，这些渔、盐产品及当地农业产品，都可及时运销外地。这对于即将开始的大规模经济建设大有好处。
    通车典礼于十一月二十二日在杏树屯车站举行。中共旅大市委副书记、旅大市人民政府市长韩光在会上讲话，祝贺金城线全线通车，并感谢苏联专家的帮助。沿线各站都举行了群众性的庆祝会，祝贺通车，并向苏联友人致谢。
