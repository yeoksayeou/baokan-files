Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 10th. The leadership of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army solemnly gathered on November 7th to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, warmly congratulating this great festival that opened a new era in human history.

At the celebration, General Yang Dezhi delivered a celebratory speech. He said: The success of the October Socialist Revolution and the great achievements in marching towards the construction of a communist society, especially the recent convening of the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the publication of Comrade Stalin's "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," have greatly encouraged the confidence of people around the world in defending peace and democracy and striving for a socialist future. He said: The Soviet Union has historically given the Chinese people the greatest friendship and assistance; with this assistance, the large-scale economic and cultural construction that is about to begin in our country will proceed faster and better. He emphasized: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army stands on the front line of defending world peace, fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Korean People's Army in the just struggle against American imperialist aggression, and should learn from the great Soviet Army—the main force in defending world peace—its high degree of patriotism, internationalism, and political vigilance; learn from the Soviet Union's advanced military science and experience in combined arms operations, and fight to the end to defend the motherland and world peace.

General Park Il-u, representative of the Korean People's Army stationed at the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, also spoke at the meeting. He thanked the Soviet Army for liberating the Korean people from Japanese fascist rule. He also pointed out that the great achievements of the Soviet people in building the cause of communism have greatly encouraged the Korean people in their sacred struggle for freedom and independence. The Korean people must further learn from the valuable experience of the Soviet people in the Great Patriotic War and continue to fight alongside the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to defeat the American aggressors.

In order to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army recently issued a notice to the entire army, instructing all units to study, in connection with the current international situation, the great world significance of the October Socialist Revolution, the relationship between the October Socialist Revolution and the Chinese People's Revolution, the selfless assistance given by the Soviet Union to the Chinese people over the past 35 years, and the great achievements of Soviet socialist and communist construction and their great significance for world peace. The notice also called on the entire army to learn from the internationalist spirit of the Soviet people and the Soviet army, to further unite the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, and to contribute the greatest strength to defend the motherland and to defend peace in the Far East and the world.

The Political Department of the Volunteer Army has also decided to screen Soviet films throughout the army to enhance the troops' understanding of the Soviet Union.
