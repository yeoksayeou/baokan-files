    More on the New Victory on the Korean Front

    The Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea has returned victoriously after more than a month of intense and arduous work. During this month, they reached various teams and penetrated many companies and forward positions, expressing the motherland's concern and support for our most beloved sons and daughters. They personally witnessed how our motherland's children and the heroic Korean people fought bravely to defend the security and peace of the motherland and the independence and freedom of the Korean people, witnessed their growing strength and rising morale, and witnessed how they beat the American beasts to the point of discarding their helmets and armor. It is particularly worth mentioning that their days of慰问 on the Korean front coincided with a new change in the situation on the Korean front, and the unprecedentedly fierce Battle of Shangganling was unfolding. They personally witnessed the progress of this battle. When they returned to the motherland, this battle had already achieved brilliant results. In the past two years, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean people have won countless victories, but the victories of the past two months have even greater significance. Now, the comrades of the慰问团 will be dispersed throughout the country to give reports. We must combine this communication to publicize the victories of the past two years, and especially to expand the publicity of this new victory. This will surely greatly encourage the people of the whole country, further strengthen their confidence in victory, and further advance the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea.
    Where does the particularly significant meaning of the victories of the past two months lie? This victory shows that the situation on the Korean battlefield has undergone new changes. In the past, we often said that our army is getting stronger as it fights, and this victory is an indicator that the Korean and Chinese People's forces have grown stronger. Let's see: In September and October last year, this same General Van Fleet launched the "Autumn Offensive" against us, launching two key offensives successively, at the cost of losing 55,000 men, in exchange for advancing six to eight kilometers in some local sections. But this year, General Van Fleet's "largest offensive in a year" can only compete for a few hilltops on a few small positions; however, even these few hilltops have been fought for more than a month without advancing a single step. In the past two months, all the enemy has gained is the loss of nearly 100,000 officers and soldiers and more than 1,300 aircraft (referring only to those shot down and damaged by our ground forces). Our army, on the other hand, not only has a fortified position like a copper wall and iron wall, but has also captured 78 enemy positions since mid-September (more than ten of which are firmly held). This shows that our army is not only good at annihilating the enemy in large numbers in mobile warfare, but has also become strong enough to annihilate the enemy in large numbers in positional warfare. Not only is the positional defense war fought well, but it has also begun to learn how to fight the positional offensive war. In the past, the enemy often boasted of its "technical superiority," but now it is exclaiming that "the Chinese army's artillery fire is fierce and concentrated, and has begun to dominate the entire battle." This situation did not exist a year ago. Because of this change, the war situation in Korea has been completely stabilized near the "38th parallel," and the enemy has to pay an even greater toll of casualties day by day.
    In the past, we often said that our army's morale is getting higher and higher, while the enemy's morale is getting lower and lower, which has been powerfully proven once again in this victory. In the battle for two hilltops near Shangganling, the enemy投入 two or more divisions of troops and more than 100 tanks on a position with an area of only three square kilometers, and even the Eighth Army's artillery general reserve队 was投入 into the battle. The intensity of the firepower reached an astonishing level rarely seen in world war history, with an average of more than 24,000 shells fired per day, and nearly 300,000 shells in the most one day and night; an average of 63 sorties of aircraft were dispatched every day, and as many as 250 sorties on the most one day, dropping more than 500 heavy bombs; almost two meters were cut off from the hilltop, and the rocks on the mountain were bombarded into a foot-thick powder. However, in the face of such a frenzied attack by the enemy, our army stood like giants of steel, repelling the enemy's attacks ten times a day or even twenty or thirty times in a row. Our soldiers who were wounded did not leave the front line, and as long as their hands could still move, they still persisted in fighting the enemy, and with the support of our army's powerful artillery units and tanks, they held the impregnable position. This is not an isolated example but a common phenomenon. Dong Cunrui-style and Matrosov-style heroic deeds have emerged in large numbers. As for the enemy, many soldiers were so frightened that they "could not fight or could not shoot," and many soldiers were frightened and went mad, and some platoon leaders took their soldiers and fled the front line. According to the results of a personal investigation on the front line by Mrs. Rosenberg, Assistant Secretary of Defense of the United States, "every soldier who spoke with her" "wanted to go home," so that this Assistant Secretary of Defense had to shamelessly "promise to send some 'blonde, blue-eyed beautiful women'," and also said that she would "request to send some dusky beauties" to boost morale.
    It is worth noting that the enemy launched this "offensive" on the sixth day after the unreasonable announcement of an "indefinite adjournment" in an attempt to break the Korean armistice negotiations, and while the United Nations General Assembly was in session and Acheson was attempting to use this assembly to pressure the accomplice countries to provide more cannon fodder to expand the Korean War, so the enemy's purpose is very obvious. However, we gave him a head-on blow, making the prestige of US imperialism even lower in front of the accomplice countries, and making it even more difficult to use the Seventh General Assembly of the United Nations as a tool for his aggressive policy.
    But let us not forget that every victory of ours is created by our volunteers and the Korean people with amazing spirit under extremely difficult conditions, and it is by no means easily won. We are fighting against the most barbaric and insane US imperialism in the world today; although it has been severely hit by the Korean and Chinese People's forces, it has not yet learned a lesson from this and is still plotting to expand the war of aggression under the pretext of forcibly detaining our captured personnel. We must not relax our vigilance for a moment, and we must make the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea more deeply, consolidated, and sustained, so that the heroic forces of China and Korea can receive a continuous stream of ever-increasing assistance, so that the war situation can continue to develop in a direction that is more favorable to us. We must integrate the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea into the specific work and daily life of the people of the whole country; earnestly do a good job in preferential treatment work; inspect and improve patriotic covenants and patriotic inspection day systems; further develop the movement to increase production and practice economy, and welcome large-scale economic construction next year; call on the people of the whole country to support the World People's Peace Conference to be held in Vienna, unite with the peace-loving people of the world to expose the aggressive policy of US imperialism, and strive for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue.

### 再论朝鲜前线的新胜利

    再论朝鲜前线的新胜利
    中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团经过一个多月的紧张艰苦的工作，现在已经胜利回来了。在这一个多月中，他们普遍到达各个团队，并且深入到许多连队，深入到许多前沿阵地，向我们最可爱的祖国的好儿女们表达了祖国人民对他们的关怀和支援。他们亲眼看到了我们祖国的儿女们和朝鲜的英雄人民为保卫祖国的安全与和平和朝鲜人民的独立与自由如何英勇作战，看到了他们的日益壮大和高涨的士气，也看到了他们怎样把美国野兽打得丢盔弃甲。特别值得提出的是他们在朝鲜前线慰问的日子正是朝鲜前线的战局正在发生新变化的时期，空前激烈的上甘岭战斗正在展开，他们亲眼看到了这一战斗的进行。当他们回到祖国来的时候，这一战斗已收到辉煌的战果了。两年来，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民一起获得了无数的胜利，但最近两个月来的胜利，却有更为重大的意义。现在，慰问团的同志们就要分散到全国各地去作传达报告了。我们一定要结合这一次的传达，好好宣传两年来的胜利，特别要把这一新胜利扩大宣传一下。这样，一定会给全国人民很大的鼓舞，更加坚定胜利的信心，把抗美援朝运动更向前推进
    一步。
    这两个月来的胜利的特别重大意义在什么地方呢？这次胜利，说明朝鲜战场的形势已起了新的变化。过去我们常常说我军愈战愈强，这次胜利就是朝中人民部队已经壮大起来了的一个指标。我们看吧：去年九、十月的时候，也是这位范佛里特将军向我们发动了“秋季攻势”，先后举行了两次重点进攻，以损失五万五千人的代价，换得在局部地段上前进六至八公里。可是今年这位范佛里特将军发动的“一年来最大的攻势”呢，只能在几个小小的阵地上争夺几个山头；然而就是这几个山头，打了一个多月，一步也没有前进。两个月来敌人所得到的只是损失近十万官兵和一千三百余架飞机（仅指我地面部队击落击伤的）。我军呢，不但阵地像铜墙铁壁一样的巩固，而且自九月中旬以来却攻占了敌军阵地七十八处（其中固守着有十多处）。这说明我军不但善于在运动战中大量歼灭敌人，而且已强大到能够在阵地战中大量歼灭敌人了。不仅阵地防御战打得很好，而且开始学会打阵地进攻战了。过去敌人常常吹嘘什么“技术优势”，现在却在惊呼“中国军队的大炮炮火猛烈集中，已开始在整个战斗中占优势”了。这一情况是在一年以前不存在的。由于这一变化，使朝鲜的战局在“三八线”附近完全稳定下来，而且使敌人不得不一天天付出更大的伤亡了。
    过去我们常常说我军士气愈战愈高，而敌军的士气则愈战愈低，也在这次胜利中又一次得到有力的证明。在上甘岭附近两个山头的战斗中，在面积仅有三平方公里的阵地上，敌人投入了两个多师的兵力和百多辆坦克，连第八军的炮兵总预备队也投入了战斗。火力的猛烈达到世界战史上少有的惊人的程度，平均每天发炮二万四千多发，最多的一昼夜近三十万发；每天出动飞机平均六十三架次，最多的一天达二百五十多架次，投掷重磅炸弹五百多枚；几乎把山头削低了两公尺，山上的岩石被轰击成一尺多厚的粉末。但在敌人这样疯狂的进攻面前，我军却和钢铁的巨人一样挺立着，每天击溃敌人十次以至连续二三十次的进攻。我军战士负伤不下火线，只要手还能动就依然坚持着与敌人战斗，在我军强大炮兵部队和坦克的支援下，守住铜墙铁壁似的阵地，这不是个别的例子而是普遍的现象。董存瑞式和马特洛索夫式的英雄事迹，大批大批地涌现出来。而敌人呢，许多士兵吓得“不能作战或不能开枪”了，还有不少士兵吓疯了，有的排长带着士兵逃下火线。据美国助理国防部长罗森堡夫人亲自到前线调查的结果，“凡是和她谈过话的兵士”都“想回家”，以至这位助理国防部长不能不无耻地“答应要派一些‘金发碧眼的漂亮女人’来，并且说还要要求派一些浅黑型的美女来”鼓舞士气。
    值得注意的是：敌人发动这次“攻势”，是在无理宣布“无限期休会”企图破裂朝鲜停战谈判之后的第六天，是在联合国大会正在开会，艾奇逊企图通过这个大会压迫帮凶国多出炮灰以扩大朝鲜战争的时候，因此敌人的目的是很明显的。而我们却给他一个迎头痛击，使得美帝国主义在帮凶国家面前的威信更加低落，要利用联合国第七届大会作为他侵略政策的工具便更增加困难了。
    但我们不要忘记：我们的每一个胜利，都是我们志愿军和朝鲜人民在极端艰苦的条件下发挥惊人的精神创造出来的，决不是轻易得来的。我们是在和今天世界上最野蛮最疯狂的美帝国主义作战；它虽然受到朝中人民部队沉重的打击，但还没从这儿接受教训，还在强迫扣留我方被俘人员的藉口下阴谋扩大侵略战争。我们必须一刻也不松懈我们的警惕性，必须使抗美援朝运动更加深入、巩固和持久发展下去，使中朝英雄部队得到源源不断的、愈来愈大的援助，才能使战局继续向着对我们更加有利的方面发展。我们必须把抗美援朝运动深入到全国人民的具体工作和日常生活中去；认真做好优抚工作；检查、改进爱国公约和爱国检查日制度；更进
    一步开展增产节约运动，迎接明年大规模的经济建设；号召全国人民拥护即将在维也纳召开的世界人民和平大会，团结全世界爱好和平的人民揭露美帝国主义的侵略政策，争取朝鲜问题和平解决的胜利。
