Now, millions upon millions of people in our two countries are continuing to work and labor to make the friendship between our two countries more developed and consolidated. Let the friendship between the people of our two countries be more consolidated. Long live the great Chinese people! Tikhonov raised his glass to congratulate the Chinese people and the health of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!
