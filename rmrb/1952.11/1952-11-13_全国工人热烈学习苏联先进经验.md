Xinhua News Agency, 12th: Workers across the country are enthusiastically participating in the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities. Through this activity, a movement to learn and promote advanced Soviet production experience has been launched in industrial and mining enterprises across the country.

Every factory and mine is abuzz with discussions and studies of advanced Soviet experiences. Workers at the Xi'an Railway Bureau, in conjunction with the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities, proposed to vigorously promote thirty-three advanced Soviet experiences, such as the soft water method and the Lunin-style locomotive maintenance method, and demanded that the bureau's car loading volume in November increase by 27% compared to October. The Huanggu Tun Railway Factory in Shenyang has organized groups in each workshop to promote advanced Soviet experiences, leading the factory in promoting three important advanced Soviet experiences: "Organizing rhythmic production according to production instruction charts," "Zendarova work method," and "three-inspection method." The Jinan Railway Factory also established a special committee for promoting advanced Soviet experiences during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" and formulated a promotion plan. Many factories have already achieved significant results in this movement to learn from advanced Soviet experiences. Workers at the Shandong Paper Mill tested the Soviet expert Vilensky's method of manufacturing semi-pulp from rice straw before the October Revolution Day and will vigorously promote it during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." The application of this advanced work method has reduced the cost of each ton of pulp from 14 million yuan to 6 million yuan. Twenty-six model teams at the Northwest Construction Engineering Company, after learning and implementing advanced Soviet bricklaying methods, have increased their work efficiency by two to four times compared to the past.

In order to more systematically learn from advanced Soviet experiences, many industrial and mining departments are summarizing the achievements and experiences of learning from advanced Soviet experiences in recent years. During the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," mechanical factories in Shenyang are earnestly summarizing advanced Soviet experiences in order to solve several key problems in the current movement to increase production and practice economy. The Third Workshop of Mechanical Factory No. 7 has summarized the advanced experience of implementing specialized division of labor in joint groups, and it is expected that the production task for November will be overfulfilled. The application of one of the advanced Soviet experiences—the Kovalev work method—has further attracted attention in various regions. Each workshop of the Chengdu Yuhua Textile Factory has summarized workshop work methods based on the Kovalev work method, and as a result, the production efficiency of yarn-winding workers has increased by 25%, and the downtime for each car of roving workers has been reduced by 51.5%. After learning the workshop work method, the roving workshop workers have generally doubled their ability to manage their machines. The Jinan Postal and Telecommunications Bureau has summarized nineteen advanced experiences applicable to its unit using the Kovalev work method.

During the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," many industrial and mining departments also launched a vigorous labor competition in conjunction with the promotion of advanced Soviet experiences. The weaving workshop of the Qingdao State-owned No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory launched the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Red Flag" competition during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," and the output per loom per shift has increased from an average of 42.24 yards in October to nearly 44 yards. Workers who are building the Chengdu-Mianyang section of the Tiancheng Railway decided at the workers' representative conference held before the October Revolution Day to launch a "Superiority Cycle Red Flag Competition" in the entire work area to ensure that they will complete this year's basic construction plan in the last two months of this year, and strive to overfulfill the original target of increasing production and practicing economy by 20%.

Workers in various places are using new labor achievements as gifts to celebrate the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," and many of these achievements have been obtained by learning from advanced Soviet experiences. Workers in the iron smelting workshop of a certain iron and steel company in the Central and Southern District, who manage a certain small blast furnace, put forward a series of rationalization proposals on the basis of the original implementation of the Soviet full-wind rapid method and low-temperature heavy material operation. As a result, on the 6th of this month, they created a new record in iron smelting, with the daily output of the blast furnace reaching 271% of the design capacity and the volume utilization coefficient dropping to 0.811 tons per ton. This is the seventh new national record created by the furnace. After the start of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities, more than 60% of the female yarn spinners in the State-owned Shanghai No. 19 Cotton Textile Factory have increased the number of spindles they watch. Female workers who originally watched 42-count yarn have generally increased from watching 800 spindles to 1,000 spindles, and individual female workers have even increased to watching 1,200 spindles. Hu Hengci and Zou Guodong, young workers at the Nanjing Chemical Factory of the East China Industrial Department, successfully learned the Soviet semi-automatic electric welding method, which doubled work efficiency. He gave a first successful performance at the factory's October Revolution Day celebration.

During the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," industrial and mining departments in various places also conducted various forms of reports, performances, seminars, and other activities to further encourage the enthusiasm of the vast number of employees to learn and promote advanced Soviet experiences. Shenyang Machinery Factory No. 5 and No. 7 invited Soviet experts to give reports on promoting advanced Soviet experiences. Machinery Factory No. 1 held a high-speed cutting training class, preparing to gradually teach this important advanced Soviet experience to all workers in the factory. Dalian Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company and Qiqihar Machinery Factory No. 15 rewarded a large number of workers who had achieved success in learning advanced Soviet experiences during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." The Taiyuan City Federation of Trade Unions exhibited the achievements of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, Taiyuan Machine Factory, and other units in promoting advanced Soviet experiences at the city's cultural palace. Various factories and mines also invited labor models and engineering technicians who had visited the Soviet Union to give speeches. The Gansu Provincial Department of Industry and the Lanzhou City Federation of Trade Unions also jointly held an advanced experience report meeting, inviting Soviet experts to give reports.

    全国工人热烈学习苏联先进经验
    【新华社十二日讯】全国各地工人热烈参加“中苏友好月”的活动。通过这个活动，在全国工矿企业中已展开了一个学习和推广苏联先进生产经验的运动。
    各个工厂、矿山里，到处讨论和学习着苏联先进经验。西安铁路分局职工结合“中苏友好月”活动，提出要大力推广三十三种苏联先进经验，如软水法、鲁宁式机车保养法等，并要求全局十一月份的装车数要比十月份提高百分之二十七。沈阳皇姑屯铁路工厂在各个车间都组织了推广苏联先进经验的小组，领导全厂推广“按生产指示图表组织有节奏的生产”、“真达罗娃工作法”和“三检法”等三项重要的苏联先进经验。济南铁路工厂在“中苏友好月”中还专门成立了推广苏联先进经验委员会，制订了推广计划。许多工厂在这一次学习苏联先进经验的运动中已出现了显著的成绩。山东造纸总厂的工人，在十月革命节前夕试验了苏联专家威烈基金的稻草制造半料浆法，将在“中苏友好月”中大力推广。这一先进工作法运用的结果，已使该厂每吨纸浆的成本由一千四百万元降低为六百万元。西北建筑工程公司二十六个模范小组，学习和推行苏联先进砌砖法后，工作效率已比过去提高两倍到四倍。
    为了更有系统地学习苏联先进经验，许多工矿部门正在总结几年来学习苏联先进经验的成就和经验。沈阳市各机械厂在“中苏友好月”中，都认真总结苏联先进经验，以便解决当前增产节约运动中若干关键问题。机械七厂第三车间总结出推行联合小组分工专业的先进经验，预计可使十一月份生产任务超额完成。对于苏联先进经验之一——郭瓦廖夫工作法的运用，进一步引起了各地的重视。成都裕华纱厂各车间根据郭瓦廖夫工作法总结出车间工作法，摇纱工人的生产效率因此提高了百分之二十五，落纱工人每落一台车的停车时间也因此降低了百分之五十一点五，粗纱间工人学习车间工作法后，看台能力普遍提高了一倍。济南邮电局运用郭瓦廖夫工作法已总结出十九种适用于本单位的先进经验。
    在“中苏友好月”中，很多工矿部门结合推广苏联先进经验，还展开了轰轰烈烈的劳动竞赛。青岛国营第三棉纺织厂的织布车间，在“中苏友好月”中开展了“中苏友好红旗”竞赛，每台织布机每班产量已由十月份平均四十二点二四码提高到将近四十四码。正在修筑天成铁路成（都）绵（阳）段的工人，在十月革命节前夕举行的职工代表大会上，决定在全工区展开“优胜循环红旗竞赛”，保证在今年度最后两个月中，完成本年度基本建设计划，并争取超额完成原订增产节约百分之二十的任务。
    各地工人纷纷用新的劳动成就作为庆祝“中苏友好月”的献礼，这些成就中有许多也是由于学习苏联先进经验而获得的。中南区某钢铁公司炼铁车间管理某号小型高炉的工人，在原来实行苏联全风快速法和低温重料作业的基础上，提出一系列的合理化建议，结果在本月六日创造了炼铁炉日产量达到设计能力百分之二百七十一，容积利用系数降到每吨零点八一一吨的新纪录。这是该炉创造的第七次全国新纪录。国营上海第十九棉纺织厂的女工们在
    “中苏友好月”活动开始后，已有百分之六十以上的细纱挡车工提高了看锭数量。原来看挡四十二支纱的女工，已普遍由看八百锭提高到一千锭，个别女工更提高到看一千二百锭。华东工业部南京化学工厂青年工人胡恒慈、邹国栋学习苏联半自动电焊法成功，使工作效率提高一倍，他在该厂十月革命节庆祝大会上曾作了第一次试验成功的表演。
    在“中苏友好月”中，各地工矿部门还进行了各种形式的报告、表演、座谈等活动，以进一步鼓舞广大职工学习与推广苏联先进经验的热情。沈阳机械五厂和七厂都邀请苏联专家作了推广苏联先进经验的报告，机械一厂举办了高速切削训练班，准备逐步在全厂工人中传授这一重要的苏联先进经验。大连中苏造船公司和齐齐哈尔机械十五厂在“中苏友好月”中奖励了大批学习苏联先进经验有成就的工人。太原市总工会在市内文化宫展览了太原钢铁厂、太原机器厂等单位推广苏联先进经验的成就，各厂矿还邀请赴苏参观的劳动模范、工程技术人员讲演。甘肃省工业厅和兰州市总工会等单位，也联合举办先进经验报告会，请苏联专家作报告。
