Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 3rd: Korean public opinion circles and responsible figures from various democratic parties and people's organizations unanimously protested the UN General Assembly's illegal decision, under the manipulation of the United States, to refuse the participation of North Korean representatives in discussions regarding germ warfare.

    The "Democratic Korea" newspaper published an editorial titled "Our Representatives Must Be Allowed to Participate in Discussions on Germ Warfare," stating: The Korean people have an inviolable right to participate in this discussion, because the Korean people are the victims and plaintiffs of the germ warfare crimes. A UN General Assembly that only allows the defendant to participate and not the plaintiff is obviously illegal, one-sided, and absolutely cannot be tolerated. The Korean people resolutely protest the UN General Assembly's decision to refuse the participation of representatives of the Korean people in the discussions.

    Hyun Heun, Chairman of the Korean Federation of Trade Unions, published an article in "Labor News" saying: The fact that the U.S. aggressors are conducting germ warfare has been completely confirmed by the authoritative report of the International Scientific Commission. However, at the Seventh UN General Assembly, the U.S. still forced its puppet nations to pass a resolution to illegally discuss the issue of investigating the facts of germ warfare in Korea without the participation of representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Hyun Heun said: The Korean people will never recognize any decisions made by the UN General Assembly regarding Korean issues without the participation of representatives of the Korean people, because such decisions are one-sided decisions that disregard the legitimate rights of the Korean people.

    Hong Gi-ju, Vice Chairman of the North Korean Democratic Party, said in a statement: The U.S. imperialists are afraid that the Korean representatives will expose the truth about the U.S.'s most heinous war of aggression in human history and the criminal atrocities that trample on all international laws in Korea. They are afraid of a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, so they refused to allow Korean representatives to participate in the discussions of the UN General Assembly. The Korean people will never recognize the shameful measures of this UN General Assembly that violate the will of peace-loving people, as well as all unreasonable and unfair decisions regarding the Korean issue. The Korean people will further strengthen the glorious struggle to defend the independence and freedom of their motherland.

    Kim Dal-hyun, Chairman of the Chondoist Chongu Party of North Korea, said in a statement: Although the U.S. imperialists used their voting machine at the UN General Assembly to pass illegal decisions, the entire Korean people will never recognize them and resolutely declare them invalid.

    Park Gi-hwan, Secretary-General of the North Korean Christian League, said in a statement: The Korean people will fight to the end against the rampant and domineering aggressors. The U.S. imperialist aggressors must know that the tricks it used in the UN General Assembly, apart from adding a new crime to itself, will gain nothing.

    联大在美国操纵下拒绝朝鲜代表参加讨论细菌战问题
    朝鲜人民一致抗议联合国大会的非法决定
    【新华社平壤三日电】朝鲜舆论界和各民主党派、人民团体负责人一致抗议联合国大会在美国操纵下拒绝朝鲜代表参加关于细菌战问题讨论的非法决定。
    “民主朝鲜”报以“必须让我们的代表参加关于细菌战的讨论”为题发表社论说：朝鲜人民有着必须参加这次讨论的不可侵犯的权利，因为朝鲜人民正是细菌战罪行的被害者和原告。联合国大会只许被告参加而不让原告参加的讨论，显然是非法的，片面的，是绝不能容许的。朝鲜人民坚决抗议联合国大会拒绝朝鲜人民代表参加讨论的决定。
    朝鲜职业总同盟委员长玄勋在“劳动新闻”上发表文章说：美国侵略者进行细菌战的事实，已被国际科学委员会的权威报告所完全证实。而在联合国第七届大会上，美国仍强迫它的仆从国家通过决定，在没有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表参加的情形下非法地讨论关于调查在朝鲜的细菌战事实的问题。玄勋说：联合国大会在没有朝鲜人民代表参加下作出的有关朝鲜问题的任何决定，朝鲜人民决不能承认，因为这样的决定是漠视朝鲜人民的合法权利的片面决定。
    北朝鲜民主党副委员长洪箕畴发表谈话说：美帝国主义者害怕朝鲜代表揭露美国在朝鲜进行的人类历史上最恶毒的侵略战争和蹂躏一切国际法规的罪恶暴行的真相，害怕朝鲜问题的和平解决，所以拒绝朝鲜代表参加联合国大会的讨论。朝鲜人民决不承认本届联合国大会违背爱好和平人民的意志的可耻措施及一切关于朝鲜问题的不合理不公平的决定。朝鲜人民将进一步加强保卫自己祖国独立自由的光荣斗争。
    朝鲜天道教青友党委员长金达铉发表谈话说：尽管美帝国主义者在联合国大会上利用它的表决机器通过了非法的决定，全朝鲜人民决不予以承认，并且坚决宣布它无效。
    北朝鲜基督教徒联盟书记长朴基焕发表谈话说：朝鲜人民将为反对横行霸道的侵略者而斗争到底。美帝国主义侵略者必须知道它在联合国大会上所使用的诡计，除了使它自己多了一项新的罪行外，是什么也得不到的。
