    The happy people of our capital city have enjoyed the outstanding performances of the famous Soviet artists and the Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble of the Soviet Army, sent by our beloved Comrade Stalin. As far as the musical programs in these performances are concerned, they mark the high achievements and brilliant victory of Soviet musical culture, obtained under the care and supervision of the great Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet people.

    These unforgettable musical performances specifically illustrate the basic principles of the development of Soviet musical culture. These basic principles are: First, Soviet music effectively serves the struggle for the great construction of a communist society. Music must first be able to express the people's lives and aspirations, thoughts and emotions. Second, Soviet music is the continuation and development of the excellent traditions of classical music – the advanced labor achievements of working people all over the world, and overcomes its outdated and stagnant elements in the process of development. Third, Soviet music has a clear national form, fully develops the advantages of various national musical cultures, and enriches the musical treasure house of the world's working people. Fourth, Soviet music is armed with high skills and has a perfect form of expression.

    The proletariat is the most selfless class in history, and only the proletariat can inherit and develop the musical and cultural achievements of the world's working people. Therefore, Soviet musicians can not only interpret Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff so profoundly, but also play Chopin and Schumann so exquisitely. Capitalist society has reduced piano playing to the level of a "finger sports competition" like boxing. They themselves admit that the highest technique that so-called pianists attempt to achieve is simply "playing faster and louder than another pianist." Soviet young violinists and pianists have not only surpassed the level of capitalist society in interpretation and expression, but also in technique.

    In the friendly family of socialist society, the musical culture of all Soviet nationalities has blossomed brilliantly under the socialist system, and excellent national singers so kindly tell the voices from the bottom of the hearts of happy people. Soviet artists have given us the best demonstration in the work of developing national vocal culture. The issue of national forms in vocal performance that we have been arguing about for a long time has been preliminarily resolved here.

    Special mention should be made of the choir's performance, which can be said to have reached the highest peak of choral art. This is a completely new school of choral art, neither as cumbersome as the Roman Catholic Church choir, nor as flashy as the Western European opera house choir. They sang the "Song to Stalin," which is loved by people all over the world, cleverly blending the two emotions of lofty praise and cordial love; they sang Schumann's "Dreaming," using the human voice to express emotions that instrumental music cannot express so delicately; they sang the famous Russian folk song "Song of the Volga Boatmen," this ancient folk song has been given a completely new meaning: here is no longer the endless painful labor, but the Russian people's spirit of confidence in overcoming nature is emphasized.

    In the performed works, we can clearly see the great victory of realism over formalism. This makes us realize a primary aesthetic principle of musical realism. This is completely opposite to the so-called "modern school," that is, all musical expression elements are subordinate to another main element - melody. Harmony and counterpoint originate from melody, that is to say, the laws of harmony must be found in the laws of melody; rhythm and orchestration are subordinate to melody, that is to say, the expression of the melody cannot be destroyed because of the sound effect. Melody is the most important musical vocabulary - that is, the melody that expresses the content and the harmony with a clear purpose. This is a musical vocabulary that will never be subjectively rejected by a small group of people from the "modern school." In a sense, this generation-to-generation musical vocabulary is like a generation-to-generation language that retains a certain structure and grammar. Comrade Stalin explained this very clearly in his great thesis "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics." Of course, these musical vocabularies will change some of their characteristics due to the richness of life, and songs such as "Kazakh Round Dance" are a good illustration. Excellent realistic musical works movingly tell stories about the beautiful life of the Soviet people and the feats of heroic soldiers.

    The performance of Soviet artists marks the brilliant victory of realistic music creation and music performance. Our music workers will be greatly inspired by carefully studying these performances, and will guide us on the road ahead.

    现实主义的音乐的辉煌胜利
    赵渢
    我国首都的幸福的人民，欣赏了亲爱的斯大林同志派遣来的苏联著名的艺术家和苏军红旗歌舞团的优异的演出。就这些演出中的音乐节目来说，它标志着苏维埃的音乐文化，在伟大的苏联共产党及苏联人民爱护与监督之下所获得的高度的成就和光辉的胜利。
    这些令人永远不能忘记的音乐演出，具体地说明了苏维埃音乐文化发展的基本原则。这些基本原则是：第一，苏维埃音乐有成效地服务于伟大的共产主义社会建设的斗争。音乐，首先要能表现人民的生活与愿望、思想和情感。第二，苏维埃音乐是古典音乐优秀传统——全世界劳动人民先进的劳动成果的继续和发展，并在发展的过程中克服其陈腐的、停滞的因素。第三，苏维埃音乐具有明显的民族形式，充分发展各民族音乐文化的优点，丰富世界劳动人民的音乐宝库。第四，苏维埃音乐为高度的技巧所武装，具有着完美的表现形式。
    无产阶级是历史上最无私的阶级，只有无产阶级才能继承并发展世界劳动人民的音乐文化成果。所以，苏联音乐家们不仅能够那么深刻地解释柴可夫斯基和拉赫玛尼诺夫，而且能够那么精湛地演奏晓邦和舒曼。资本主义社会把钢琴演奏降低到像拳赛一样的“手指的体育竞赛”的地步。他们自己也承认，所谓钢琴家企图达到的最高技术，不过是“比另一位钢琴家能奏的更快更响”而已。苏联的年青的提琴家、钢琴家们，不仅在解释和表现上，即在技术上也已经超过了资本主义社会的水平。
    社会主义社会之友爱的民族大家庭，苏联各民族的音乐文化在社会主义制度下灿烂地开了花，优秀的民族歌者们那么亲切地述说着幸福的人民的心底的声音。在发展民族的声乐文化的工作上，苏联的艺术家给我们作了最好的示范。我们争论很久的声乐演唱上的民族形式问题，已经从这里得到初步的解决。
    特别应该提到的是合唱的表演，可以说已经达到了合唱艺术的最高峰。这是合唱艺术的一个全新的学派，既不像罗马加特力教会合唱那样繁文缛节，也不像西欧歌剧院合唱那样华而不实。他们演唱那被全世界人民所喜爱的“斯大林颂”，把崇高的赞颂和亲切的爱戴两种情绪巧妙地混揉在一起；他们演唱舒曼的“梦想曲”，用人声表达了器乐不能那么细腻地表达出来的感情；他们演唱俄罗斯著名民歌“伏尔加船夫曲”，这首古老的民歌被赋予了全新的意义：这里不再是无休止的苦痛的劳动，俄罗斯人民那种人定胜天的自信精神被突出地强调出来了。
    在表演的作品中，我们明显地看到现实主义战胜形式主义的伟大的胜利。这使我们体会到音乐的现实主义的一个首要的美学原则。这和所谓“现代乐派”完全相反，那就是一切音乐表现要素都服从于另一个主要的要素——曲调。和声和对位都起源于曲调，就是说和声的规律要从曲调的规律中寻找；节奏和配器都服从于曲调，就是说不能因为音响效果而破坏了曲调的表情。曲调是最主要的音乐语汇——也就是表现内容的曲调和目的明确的和声，这是永远不会被“现代乐派”那么一小撮人所能主观地排斥掉的音乐语汇。这种世代相传的音乐语汇，在某种意义上，是和世代相传的保有一定结构和文法的语言一样的。这一点，斯大林同志在伟大的“马克思主义与语言学问题”的论文中说明的很清楚。当然，这些音乐语汇将因生活的丰富而改变它的某些特征，“哈萨克圆舞”等歌曲便是很好的说明。优秀的现实主义的音乐作品，动人地述说着关于苏维埃人民的美好生活的故事和英雄战士的功勋。
    苏联艺术家们的演奏，标志着现实主义的音乐创作与音乐演奏的辉煌胜利。我国的音乐工作者们认真地学习这些演出，将会给我们莫大的启示，指引着我们前进的道路。
