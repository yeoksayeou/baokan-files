Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 19th: The bi-weekly journal *News* published a conversation between Ilya Ehrenburg, Vice-Chairman of the Soviet Peace Committee, Permanent Member of the World Peace Council, renowned Soviet writer, and Stalin Prize laureate, and a reporter from the magazine, detailing the preparations for the World People's Peace Congress scheduled to be held in Vienna in December. Ehrenburg said: The World People's Peace Congress will prove to be an important factor in easing the current international tensions. Since the Warsaw Peace Congress, the peace movement has continued to grow stronger in all countries. The strength of the peace movement is so great that it has thwarted the conspiracy of a handful of billionaires who want to expand the current military conflicts and turn them into a Third World War. However, the peace movement is not yet strong enough to force certain governments to abandon "power politics" and implement a policy of consultation. Although in many countries, people of different strata have shown their desire for peace, in some countries, the peace movement has not yet spread among the broad masses of the people. This is precisely what prompted the World Peace Council to decide to convene the World People's Peace Congress. This Peace Congress is not only the third congress of the peace movement but also a gathering of representatives of all parties, peace groups, religious and cultural organizations that recognize the principle that different social and economic systems can coexist. This proposal of the World Peace Council has been warmly responded to in many regions of the world.

Ehrenburg, listing the countries that will send representatives to the congress, said: Although the American people are often misled, do not receive correct information, and are spiritually isolated from the outside world, the vast majority of the people still love peace, and they will send a large and representative delegation to participate in the World People's Peace Congress. Those who specialize in confusing the American public insist that the purpose of the peace movement is to oppose the American way of life. This is, of course, nonsense. Every nation is free to choose and love their favorite way of life. The peace movement has always advocated respect for all ways of life and advocated non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. The World People's Peace Congress will be more representative than the peace movement and obviously cannot become a place to attack the American way of life or the way of life of any other country; this congress will very seriously strive to reach an agreement on one or more of the controversial issues that divide the world. At such a peace congress, the voice of the American people will inevitably be heard.

Ehrenburg added: All the countries of Western Europe will send representatives to participate in the Peace Congress. After the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference was held in Beijing, we can be sure that the Asian people will send a wide range of representatives to the World People's Peace Congress in Vienna. For example, the Indian delegation will certainly convey the opinions of various parties in that great country.

Ehrenburg said: The youth, who are particularly sensitive to the threat of war, have the most intense interest in the congress and all peace work. There is much material to prove this, the most prominent of which is the recently published minutes of the negotiations between the World Student Christian Federation and many Catholic student groups related to the "Peace Forces" organization on whether they can participate in the peace movement.

The Soviet Peace Committee welcomes the decision to convene the World People's Peace Congress. The Soviet delegation, along with other delegations, will explain at the congress its views on how to resolve many of the disputed issues. The attitude of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace is the same. Therefore, representatives from Western countries will be able to come into contact with representatives from the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democracies and begin very necessary negotiations.

When asked by the reporter whether he thought the World People's Peace Congress in Vienna would be fruitful, Ehrenburg said: I deeply believe that the effort to seek peaceful solutions to disputed issues by all possible means is itself a gain: not only because people will not kill each other when negotiating, but also because when people in various countries see that peace agreements are possible, they will more fiercely oppose attempts to resolve problems by force.

    爱伦堡论世界人民和平大会筹备情况
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十七日讯：《新闻》双周刊刊载了苏联拥护和平委员会副主席、世界和平理事会常务委员、苏联名作家、斯大林奖金得奖人爱伦堡对该杂志记者的谈话，详论定于十二月在维也纳举行的世界人民和平大会的筹备工作情况。爱伦堡说：世界人民和平大会将证明是缓和目前国际紧张局势的一个重要因素。在华沙和平大会之后，和平运动已在各国继续发展壮大。和平运动的力量是如此强大，已使得那些想要扩大目前的军事冲突，使它变成第三次世界大战的一小撮亿万富翁的阴谋不能得逞。然而，和平运动还不是强大得足以迫使某些政府放弃“强权政治”而实行协商政策。虽然在许多国家，不同阶层的人民已经表明了他们的要求和平的意志，但是在有些国家，和平运动还没有在广大的人民群众中展开。这正是促使世界和平理事会决定召开世界人民和平大会的原因。这个和平大会不仅是和平运动的第三次大会，而且是一切承认不同的社会和经济制度能够并存的原则的党派、和平团体、宗教和文化组织的代表的大会师。世界和平理事会这个建议已获得了世界许多地区的热烈响应。
    爱伦堡列举将派代表出席大会的国家时说道：尽管美国人民经常被蒙蔽，得不到正确的消息，在精神上与外界隔绝，但是绝大多数人民仍是热爱和平的，他们会派一个人数众多的具有代表性的代表团来参加世界人民和平大会。那些专门混淆美国公众的视听的人，硬说和平运动的目的是反对美国的生活方式。这自然是胡说。每一国人民都可以自由地选择并且热爱他们最喜爱的生活方式。和平运动向来主张尊重各种生活方式，并且主张不得干涉他国内政。世界人民和平大会将比和平运动更具有代表性，显然不可能成为一个攻击美国的生活方式或其他任何国家的生活方式的场所；这次大会将极为认真地努力求得在分裂世界的某个或某些引起争论的问题上达成协议。在这样一个和平大会上，美国人民的声音也必然会使大家听见。
    爱伦堡又说：西欧所有的国家都会派代表来参加和平大会。在北京召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议之后，我们可以确信亚洲人民将会广泛地派代表出席维也纳世界人民和平大会。例如印度代表团就一定会传达那个伟大的国家里各种党派的意见。
    爱伦堡说：对于战争的威胁特别敏感的青年，对大会以及一切和平工作的兴趣最浓厚。有许多材料可以证明这一点，其中最突出的就是最近发表的世界基督教学生联合会和许多与“和平力量”组织有关系的天主教学生团体谈判是否能够参加和平运动的会议记录。
    苏联拥护和平委员会欢迎召开世界人民和平大会的决定，苏联代表团与其他代表团一起，将在大会上说明它对于如何解决许多引起纠纷的问题的意见。中国人民保卫世界和平委员会的态度也是一样。因此，西方各国的代表们将能与苏联、中国及人民民主国家的代表发生接触并开始非常必要的谈判。
    在记者问他是否认为维也纳世界人民和平大会能有收获的时候，爱伦堡说：我深深相信，尽一切力量寻求和平解决引起纠纷的问题，这种努力本身就是一种收获：不仅是因为人民在谈判时不会相互杀害，而且是因为各国人民在看到和平协议是可以办得到的时候，它们就会更加激烈地反对用武力解决问题的企图。
