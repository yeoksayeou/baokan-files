Northeast basic construction units have, in the past four months, fully launched a mass movement to establish responsibility systems, greatly improving the construction site management and ensuring the smooth completion of basic construction tasks.

In the first half of this year, the phenomenon of no one being responsible was prevalent in basic construction work in Northeast China, resulting in poor quality of many projects and failure to complete them on schedule. In order to reverse this situation, under the leadership of the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government, various units launched a movement to establish responsibility systems. In the process of establishing responsibility systems, units generally had the site director take the lead in reviewing the losses caused to the country by his own irresponsible thinking. Subsequently, the responsible engineers and the heads of the production teams made separate reviews within their groups, and then mobilized the workers to boldly expose problems. This greatly inspired the workers' enthusiasm and sense of responsibility, revealing many facts of losses caused by no one being responsible, and putting forward specific suggestions for improvement. Afterwards, the construction management personnel, based on the problems exposed by the workers, analyzed and studied them, and formulated draft construction responsibility systems and quality responsibility systems, which were submitted to the workers for discussion and supplementation, and then promulgated and implemented. In this way, the process of discussing the establishment of the responsibility system became a process of educating the workers and staff to deeply understand and implement the responsibility system.

In terms of the specific steps for establishing the responsibility system, the units generally first established the responsibility system for clear division of labor and cooperation between the two parties, the A and B, and the responsibility system for the director of the work area, and then gradually and with emphasis established various responsibility systems according to the specific situation of the unit and the key problems that existed. For example, if the technical management work of a unit was the weakest, it would focus on strengthening the technical responsibility system; if the unit's main problem was that no one was responsible for material supply, it would focus on strengthening the material supply responsibility system, and so on.

After the establishment of the responsibility system by the units, the quality of the projects was guaranteed, changing the previously widespread phenomenon of poor quality. For example, before the establishment of the responsibility system at one construction site, none of the first batch of 36 concrete pillars and beams met the quality standards, with more than 80 defects such as pockmarks, honeycombs, dog holes, and exposed rebar. When some of the pillars and beams had their forms removed, the stones fell off, and some of the joints between the pillars and the beam piles only had stones and no concrete. More seriously, the large beams were divided into two or three sections, and the exposed rebar dog holes on the pillars were as deep as 12 centimeters, 10 centimeters wide, and 20 centimeters long, and the cracks in the concrete floor slabs were as long as 6.5 meters. After the workers boldly exposed the problems, the construction site discussed and established a quality responsibility system with the implementation of quality standards, operating procedures, and technical design review as the central content. The various departments also discussed and formulated the division of labor responsibility system for each department, the contact between departments, the scope of work of each department, and the clear division of labor for each person. This ensured that each project met the quality standards requirements, and the above-mentioned phenomenon of poor concrete quality was basically eliminated.

The establishment of the responsibility system by the units created good conditions for the promotion of advanced experience. In the past, although some units also called for the promotion of advanced experience, the promotion of advanced experience was seriously hindered because the entire construction management was in a state of no one being responsible, and there was no organization or plan responsible for promoting advanced experience. After the establishment of the responsibility system, many units clearly stipulated the responsibility system for promoting advanced experience in the construction responsibility system, established special organizations for promoting advanced experience, and formulated specific promotion plans. In this way, the promotion of advanced experience gradually formed a movement. At present, more than 30 kinds of advanced experiences are being smoothly promoted in the basic construction units in Northeast China.

With the establishment of the responsibility system, the enthusiasm of workers for creating and improving tools has also greatly increased. In the past, many workers put forward rationalization proposals for improving tools, but because no one was responsible for them and no one gave them technical appraisal, the rationalization proposals often failed to be adopted. For example, when workers from the Jilin City Construction Company proposed trial-producing 23 rationalization proposals such as ash spreaders, some leaders replied, "There are no materials." Others said, "The test fee cannot be reimbursed." As a result, none of them were successful. After the start of the movement to establish a responsibility system, many units changed the above situation, established special organizations to be responsible for leading workers to conduct research and creation, and stipulated reward systems, thus greatly encouraging the enthusiasm of the workers for invention and creation. According to statistics from basic construction departments in cities such as Liaoyang and Fushun, and provinces such as Songjiang and Jilin, workers created and improved a total of 863 kinds of tools in the month after the start of the movement to establish the responsibility system. On average, each tool increased work efficiency by 30 percent after being adopted, with the highest exceeding 70 times the original work efficiency. This greatly shortened the construction period.

The establishment of the responsibility system also cleared obstacles for the widespread adoption of mechanical construction by the units. In the past, many units had serious idleness due to chaotic construction management. Some leading cadres believed that the use of machinery would generate more idleness. This led to some mechanical teams lacking dedicated management and command, working when work came and idling when work did not come. For example, the First Engineering Office of the First Engineering Company had many winches and mixers that were idle all day long, while many tons of steel bars used for building four-story buildings were all transported manually. These unreasonable phenomena were fundamentally changed only after the establishment of a dedicated person, dedicated task, and dedicated time responsibility system at each site. In the establishment of the construction management responsibility system, each unit clearly stipulated the management and use system for various machines by the engineering team, and signed contracts with the construction site, with the trade union specifically responsible for regular inspections. In this way, various machines were normally used and fully exerted their effectiveness. For example, the daily output of the mixer was 17.64 cubic meters in the past, but now it has increased to 39.67 cubic meters.

The establishment of the responsibility system has further greatly improved the supply of raw materials. Before the movement to establish the responsibility system, the supply of raw materials in various units was mostly without a plan and without a dedicated person in charge, supplying as much as was available, often causing the construction site to stop work waiting for materials. The supply department of the First Engineering Team of Liaodong Province used to shout every day that there was not enough transportation capacity, but in fact there were dozens of large flatbed trucks idle every day. Until the end of July, the main materials transported to the site only accounted for 37.7 percent of the total required amount, and many materials did not meet the specifications, which greatly affected the progress of the project. In formulating the responsibility system, each unit formulated a responsibility system for material supply according to the progress of the project, so that the supply personnel could specifically divide the work and guarantee each other. For example, since the establishment of the material supply responsibility system in August by the First Engineering Team of Liaodong Province, the supply of raw materials has been able to meet the required quantity and specifications at the site on time, and the number of times each vehicle is transported has also increased from twice a day to three times.

Now, due to the implementation of the responsibility system by the basic construction units in Northeast China, almost every job is carried out according to the dedicated system of fixed time, fixed person, and fixed task, so the construction site presents an orderly working scene. The progress of each project has been greatly accelerated. For example, the shaft lining project of the Xi'an Mining Bureau, the Baichengzi construction site of the Third Engineering Office, and the building of the First Engineering Office's construction hall have all completed their project plans one and a half months or 15 days ahead of schedule.

    东北各基本建设单位
    建立责任制改善各工地施工管理工作
    东北各基本建设单位，最近四个月来全面展开了群众性的建立责任制运动，大大改善了各工地的施工管理工作，保证了基本建设任务的顺利完成。
    今年上半年，东北基本建设工作中曾普遍存在无人负责现象，所以许多工程的质量低劣，不能按期完工。为了扭转这一局面，各单位在东北人民政府工业部领导下，展开了建立责任制的运动。各单位在建立责任制运动过程中，一般都是现场主任首先带头检讨自己不负责任的思想给国家造成的损失，依次由专责工程师、各生产组组长分头在组内作检讨，然后再发动工人群众大胆揭发。这样，就大大启发了工人群众的积极性和责任感，揭发出许多无人负责以致造成损失的事实，并提出具体的改进意见。之后，施工管理人员根据工人揭发出的问题，经过分析研究，制订出施工责任制和质量责任制等草案，交给工人讨论补充，然后颁布执行。这样，讨论建立责任制的过程也就成为教育职工群众深刻认识和贯彻执行责任制的过程。
    各单位在建立责任制的具体步骤上，一般都是有联系的单位首先建立甲乙双方明确分工合作责任制、工区主任负责制，然后根据本单位的具体情况和存在的关键问题，逐步地有重点地建立各种责任制。如有的单位技术管理工作最为薄弱，就以加强技术责任制为重点；有的单位主要是材料供应无人负责，就以加强材料供应责任制为重点等等。
    各单位在建立责任制以后，工程质量得到保证，改变了过去普遍存在的质量低劣现象。如某工地在建立责任制以前，第一批制造的三十六根混凝土柱梁没有一根是合乎质量标准的，麻面、蜂窝、狗洞、露筋等现象达八十余处；部分柱梁一拆模型板时，石子就坠下来，有些柱子与梁垛接头处只有石子没有混凝土；更严重的是大梁分成两三段，柱子上的露筋狗洞竟深达十二公分、宽十公分、长达二十公分，混凝土楼板裂缝长达六公尺半。经过职工大胆揭发以后，这个工地就以贯彻质量标准、操作规程与技术设计的审查等为中心内容，讨论并建立了质量责任制；各科室也分别讨论制订了各科室的分工责任制及各部门联系、各部门工作范围、各人明确分工等责任制。这样就保证了各个工程达到质量标准的要求，上述混凝土质量低劣现象就被基本消灭。
    各单位责任制的建立，给推广先进经验创造了良好条件。过去，有的单位虽然也号召推广先进经验，但由于整个施工管理处在无人负责状态，也没有负责推广先进经验的机构和计划，先进经验的推广受到了严重阻碍。建立责任制以后，许多单位在施工责任制中明确地规定了推广先进经验的责任制，设立了专门推广先进经验的机构并制订了具体推广计划。这样，先进经验的推广就逐渐形成运动。目前，东北各基本建设单位已有三十多种先进经验在顺利推广中。
    随着责任制的建立，工人创造和改进工具的热情也大大提高。过去，不少工人提出有关改进工具的合理化建议，因为没有专人负责，没有人给它作技术鉴定，合理化建议往往得不到采行。如吉林市建设公司工人提出试制铺灰器等二十三种合理化建议时，有的领导人员回答说：“没有材料。”有的说：“试验费不能报销。”结果一样也没有作成功。建立责任制运动开始以后，许多单位才改变了以上的情况，建立专门机构负责领导工人进行研究创造，并规定奖励制度，因而大大鼓舞了工人群众发明创造的积极性。据辽阳、抚顺等市，松江、吉林等省的基本建设部门统计，在建立责任制运动开始的一个月中，工人创造和改进的工具共达八百六十三种，平均每种工具采用后提高工作效率百分之三十，最高的超过原来工作效率七十倍。这就大大地缩短了工期。
    责任制的建立，也给各单位广泛采用机械施工清除了障碍。过去，不少单位因施工管理混乱，窝工现象很严重。有些领导干部却认为再运用机械就会产生更多窝工。这样，就使有些机械队由于缺乏专人管理和指挥，有工作来就干、工作不找上门来就闲着。如第一工程公司第一工程处就有很多卷扬机、搅拌机等因此成天停着，而盖四层楼用的许多吨钢筋却全用人工搬运。这些不合理现象在各现场建立了专人、专事、专时的责任制度以后，才根本改变过来。各单位在建立施工管理责任制中，都明确规定工程队对各种机械的管理、使用制度，并和施工现场订立合同，由工会具体负责定期检查。这样，各种机械才得到了正常运用，充分发挥了效能。如过去搅拌机日产量是十七点六四立方公尺，现在已提高到三十九点六七立方公尺。
    责任制的建立，更大大地改进了原材料的供应工作。在建立责任制运动以前，各单位原材料的供应大都既没有计划，也没有专人负责，供应多少就算多少，常常使施工现场停工待料。辽东省第一工程队的供应部门过去每天喊运输力不够，实际上每天都有几十辆大板车在闲着。直到七月末，运到现场的主要材料才占总需要量的百分之三十七点七，很多材料还不合规格，大大影响了工程进度。在制定责任制时，各单位根据工程进度情况，订出了材料供应的责任制，使供应人员具体分工，互相保证。如辽东省第一工程队自八月份建立材料供应责任制后，原材料供应都能按时达到了现场需要的数量和规格，每辆车运输的次数，也由每天两次提高到三次。
    现在，东北各基本建设单位由于推行了责任制，几乎每件工作都在按照定时、定人、定事的专责制度进行，因而施工现场上呈现出一幅井然有序的工作景象。各个工程的进度都大大加快了，如西安矿务局竖井井筒工程、第三工程处白城子工地、第一工程处建筑专馆等工程单位，都提前一个半月或十五天完成了工程计划。
