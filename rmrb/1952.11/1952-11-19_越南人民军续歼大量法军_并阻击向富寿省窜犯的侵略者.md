Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam dispatch from Vietnam News Agency, Eighteenth: The General Command of the Vietnam People's Army recently announced that after the Vietnam People's Army achieved an important victory in Nghia Lo area on the left bank of the Black River, it annihilated 700 French troops (according to preliminary statistics) in the French-occupied area of the Third Interzone of North Vietnam between October 28 and November 8. During the same period, the Vietnam People's Army annihilated more than one company of African and European mercenaries of the French aggressors south of Van An on the right bank of the Black River, captured the Quynh Nhai airport, and annihilated part of the French troops in the area.

After suffering a disastrous defeat on the left bank of the Black River in October, the French invading army in Vietnam, in order to cover up their defeat and save their military crisis, assembled troops and ventured to invade Phu Tho Province in the Vietnamese liberated area, burning houses and destroying crops along the way. On November 9, they reached Duan Hung, 20 kilometers north of the provincial capital of Phu Tho. The Vietnam People's Army annihilated part of the French troops in the blocking battles in Xinghai, Gujie, Yuta, and Lujiang, and protected the residents in an organized retreat.

Just like when the French army invaded Hoa Binh last year, the fleeing French army only cared about their own safety, thus exposing their North Vietnamese plain positions. The Vietnam People's Army seized the opportunity and, near Ninh Binh, 100 kilometers south of Hanoi, removed the French strongholds of Bich Dao, Huan Loc, Fang Nai, and Wu Ling in Nam Dinh Province in one fell swoop, killing and capturing more than three companies of French troops, and expanding guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines in Ninh Binh Province and on both banks of the Red River.

The communique of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army pointed out that the French invading army's military adventure to invade Phu Tho this time will ultimately be defeated and will therefore be more passive.

    越南人民军续歼大量法军
    并阻击向富寿省窜犯的侵略者
    【新华社十八日讯】据越南通讯社北越讯：越南人民军总司令部最近公布：越南人民军继在黑水江左岸义路一带获得重要的胜利后，又于十月二十八日到十一月八日间，在北越第三联区法军占领区内歼灭了法军七百人（根据初步统计）。同一时期内，越南人民军在黑水江右岸万安以南歼灭了法国侵略者的非洲籍和欧洲籍的雇佣军一个连以上，并攻下了琼崖机场，歼灭了该地区的法军一部。
    侵越法军于十月间在黑水江左岸遭到惨败后，为了掩饰他们的败绩和挽救其军事危局，曾集结兵力向越南解放区富寿省冒险进犯，沿途焚烧房屋、破坏农作物，于十一月九日窜抵距省会富寿以北二十公里的端雄。越南人民军在兴海、古节、玉塔、泸江等地的阻击战中歼灭了法军一部，并保护居民作有组织的撤退。
    正如去年法军进犯和平时一样，窜犯的法军顾首不顾尾，因而暴露了他们的北越平原阵地。越南人民军掌握时机，在河内南方一百公里的宁平附近，一举拔除了法军据点碧桃、缓禄、方耐以及南定省的伍陵，击毙和俘掳了法军三个连以上，并在宁平省与红河两岸各地扩大了敌后游击战。
    越南人民军总司令部的公报指出：侵越法军这一次进犯富寿的军事冒险行动，最后一定要遭到失败，并将因此而更加陷于被动。
