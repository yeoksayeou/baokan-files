Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    Editor: The opinions expressed in the "Reader's Letters Column" on August 13, "Farmers in Hebei Province and Lucheng County, Shanxi Province Request the People's Government to Solve the Problem of Repair and Replacement of New Agricultural Implements," are worthy of attention.

    With the promotion of new agricultural implements, the repair and replacement of these implements is an urgent problem to be solved. Although we have paid attention to this issue in the past, we have not been able to address it promptly. For example, parts such as the handle of the chaff cutter and the hoe teeth of the three-pronged weeder were not distributed until long after the implements had been promoted. This shows that our work is not responsible enough and that our concern for farmers is not sufficient. On August 20, our ministry held a symposium on the promotion of new agricultural implements, where the issue of repair and replacement was discussed and a decision was made, which has been submitted to higher authorities for approval and to the major administrative regions and provinces for study. The decision includes the following: First, all new agricultural implement manufacturers must prepare sufficient parts based on the lifespan of the implement parts to ensure timely supply. Second, for some new agricultural implements that have been promoted to farmers but whose original factory has stopped manufacturing, the promotion departments should find ways to help farmers repair and replace parts. Third, in areas where new agricultural implements are widely promoted, the promotion departments should equip themselves with repair tools to repair for farmers in a timely manner. Fourth, cooperatives in various places should, according to specific conditions, organize and train local blacksmiths and carpenters to learn the repair and replacement techniques of new agricultural implements so that they can undertake part of the repair work. Fifth, while teaching farmers the technology of using new agricultural implements, agricultural implement stations should also teach the maintenance and repair techniques of new agricultural implements. In this way, on the one hand, the service life of the implements can be extended; on the other hand, farmers can carry out some relatively simple repairs and replacement of parts themselves.

### 中央农业部对解决新式农具的修配问题已作出具体决定

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中央农业部对解决新式农具的修配问题已作出具体决定
    编辑同志：八月十三日“读者来信专页”刊载的“河北省和山西潞城县的农民要求人民政府解决新式农具的修配问题”的意见，是值得重视的。
    随着新式农具的推广，新式农具的修配是个急待解决的问题。我们过去虽已注意这个问题，但没能及时抓紧解决。如铡草机板手和三齿耘锄的锄齿等零件，在农具推广很久后，还迟迟没发下去。这说明我们工作不够负责，对农民的关心还不够。八月二十日，我部召开的新式农具推广座谈会上对新式农具的修配问题进行了讨论，作出了决定，并已呈报上级批准及提请各大行政区和各省研究。决定的几项内容是：一，各新式农具制造厂必须根据农具零件的使用期限，充分准备零件，以保证及时供应。二，有些已推广到农民手中而原厂停止制造的新式农具，推广部门应设法帮助农民修配零件。三，新式农具推广较多的地区，推广部门应配备修配工具，以便及时为农民修理。四，各地合作社应根据具体条件，组织、训练当地铁匠、木匠等学会新式农具的修配技术，使他们担当起一部分修配工作。五，农具站在向农民传授新式农具使用技术的同时，应传授新农具的保养和修配技术。这样，一方面可以延长农具的使用年限；另一方面使农民能自己作某些比较简单的修理和配换零件工作。　中央人民政府农业部
