    Constantly Fight Against Bureaucracy

    The "Guo Jinsheng Incident" exposed extremely serious bureaucracy. After the "Three-Anti" campaign, especially after the handling of the Zhang Shunyou incident, some Party and non-Party cadres, particularly some responsible cadres, still had serious bureaucratic work styles, and adopted an attitude of indifference to the life problems of the masses and the interests of honored soldiers and their families! Honored soldier Guo Jinsheng went to Beijing four times, to Baoding four times, to the Hengshui Special District Branch of the People's Court more than ten times, and to the county People's Court more than seventy times to demand the serious handling of his father's forced suicide case, traveling more than 20,000 li. The case dragged on for a year and a half, and the final exposure and handling of this incident was not done by the local Party committee and People's Court, but by a reporter from the Hebei Daily and the Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China. Can it be tolerated that Party and non-Party cadres in these organs treat the people with such a bureaucratic attitude?

    The lesson of this incident is very profound. It specifically illustrates how weak the mass perspective is for many cadres! Verbally, they often shout "Serve the people," but when the people repeatedly come to them, asking them to do something they should do, they use excuses such as "busy with work" and "many meetings" to reject the people thousands of miles away! Is there even a shadow of the masses' interests in their minds? Chairman Mao earnestly taught us: "All practical life problems of the masses are problems we should pay attention to." Not to mention issues concerning the lives of the masses! "If we pay attention to these problems, solve them, and satisfy the needs of the masses, we will truly become organizers of the masses' lives, and the masses will truly rally around us and enthusiastically support us." The cadres involved in the Guo Jinsheng incident have completely forgotten Chairman Mao's instructions, not remembering a single word!

    The Guo Jinsheng incident also shows that some cadres have certain sectarian sentiments. Because this incident involves the issue of cadres, they have to "take care" of them, and they use excuses such as "the issue involves cadres and needs to be discussed with relevant authorities" and "needs investigation." Did they really "discuss" and "investigate" seriously? They just pushed it back and forth, and delayed it.

    The Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China has seriously dealt with the Guo Jinsheng complaint and called on all levels of organs in the province to continue to carry out the struggle against bureaucracy in depth according to different situations, which is completely necessary. If such serious bureaucratic phenomena are not eliminated, our struggle against bureaucracy can never be stopped.

    经常地和官僚主义作斗争
    “郭金升事件”暴露了十分严重的官僚主义。在“三反”以后，尤其在处理了张顺有事件以后，居然还有些党与非党干部，特别是一些负责干部，依然有严重的官僚主义作风，对有关群众的生命问题，对荣誉军人及其家属的利害问题，竟采取置之不理的态度！荣誉军人郭金升为要求严正处理父亲被逼自杀案，曾四次上北京，四次到保定，十几次到人民法院衡水专区分院，七十几次到县人民法院，奔波两万余里，案件拖了一年半，而最后揭发和处理这一事件的，不是所在地的党委和人民法院，而是河北日报的记者和中共河北省委。这些机关中的党与非党干部竟用这样官僚主义的态度对待人民，这难道是能够容忍的吗？
    这一事件的教训是非常深刻的。它具体说明了有许多干部的群众观点是何等薄弱！在口头上，他们也常喊“为人民服务”，但当人民再三找上门来，要求他们作点应作的事情时，他们却用“工作忙”、“会议多”等借口，拒绝人民于千里之外！在他们的脑子里，难道有一点群众利益的影子吗？毛主席谆谆地教导我们：“一切群众的实际生活问题，都是我们应当注意的问题。”何况有关群众生命的问题！“假如我们对这些问题注意了，解决了，满足了群众的需要，我们就真正成了群众生活的组织者，群众就会真正围绕在我们的周围，热烈地拥护我们。”郭金升事件的有关干部，把毛主席的指示完全忘记了，一个字都不记得了！
    郭金升事件又说明了某些干部存在着某些宗派主义情绪。因为这一事件涉及干部的问题，他们就得“照顾照顾”，他们就借口什么“涉及干部问题，需要与有关机关商量”，“需要调查”。到底认真“商量”、“调查”了没有呢？不过推来推去，拖延时日罢了。
    中共河北省委严正地处理了郭金升控诉事件，并号召全省各级机关根据不同情况，继续深入开展反官僚主义的斗争，这是完全必要的。这样严重的官僚主义现象不消灭，我们的反官僚主义的斗争是决不能停止的。
