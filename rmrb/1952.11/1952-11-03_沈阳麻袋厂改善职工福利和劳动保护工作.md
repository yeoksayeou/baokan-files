    Shenyang Sack Factory Improves Employee Welfare and Labor Protection
    To the Editor: The Shenyang Sack Factory's employee welfare and labor protection work has improved significantly after criticism from newspapers and superiors. Since June of this year, factory leaders have begun to pay attention to employee welfare and labor protection, personally taking action to solve existing problems. For example, the original family dormitories have all been converted into apartment buildings, housing eight hundred and forty single workers. The original single workers' bungalows have been divided into eighty-eight small rooms of twelve square meters each, for worker families with two or three people. Families with larger populations have larger houses. All the houses' windows, chimneys, and roofs have been repaired. The walls of the single workers' dormitories have been painted with blue distemper halfway up, and heating has been installed. The nursery and spare time sanatoriums have also been expanded. Spraying equipment has been installed in the factory buildings, and all machines have been equipped with protective covers. The newly built 420-square-meter health canteen is also nearing completion. The sanatorium with forty beds is being renovated internally, ready to receive patients. Other facilities such as dust removal equipment and ventilation equipment will all be resolved by next spring.
    Since this factory improved its employee safety and welfare work, the attendance rate has gradually increased, reaching 93.25 percent in September. The enthusiasm of the workers has also increased day by day, and the third quarter's task was completed three days ahead of schedule, moreover, they made up for the unfinished tasks of the second quarter.

    沈阳麻袋厂改善职工福利和劳动保护工作
    编辑同志：沈阳麻袋厂的职工福利和劳动保护工作，经过报纸和上级批评，已有很大改进。自今年六月以来，厂领导干部开始重视职工福利和劳动保护工作，亲自动手解决存在的问题。如原来家属住的宿舍，已全部改成楼房，给八百四十名单身工人住。原来单身工人住的平房，隔成十二平方公尺的小房子八十八间，给有二、三口人的工人家属住。人口多的家属，有较大的房子。全部房子的窗户、烟囱、房盖都重新修理过，单身工人宿舍的墙壁还刷了半截蓝色水粉，装上暖气。把托儿所、业余休养所也都扩大了。厂房装喷雾设备，机器全部装上保护罩。新建的四百二十平方公尺的保健食堂，也快完工。四十个床位的疗养所，正在整修内部，准备接受疗养员。其他如除尘设备、通风设备等，明年春季可全部解决。
    这个厂自改善了职工的安全福利工作后，出勤率便逐渐上升，九月份已达到百分之九十三点二五。职工劳动热情也日益高涨，第三季度任务提前三天完成，而且补上了第二季度未完成的任务。
