    Yangquan Mining Bureau Accepts Criticism and Emphasizes Improving Coal Quality

    Editor: In the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on October 20th, the communications group of China Coal Industry Construction Materials Company criticized our bureau for the poor quality of coal produced. This criticism is correct, and we sincerely accept it. In the future, we should further improve the quality of coal produced, reduce the stone content, save national resources, and consolidate the reputation of state-owned enterprises.

    Since the Ministry of Fuel Industry issued regulations on ensuring quality and quantity, it has attracted our attention. We have assigned special personnel in each mine to select coal. In late July, we also mobilized the loading workers to pick out stones during loading. Especially during the increase production and conservation campaign, we also mobilized the production and loading workers to set quality assurance plans. Although we have done the above work to improve quality, after inspection, there is still a serious task-only viewpoint, and not enough attention is paid to improving quality.

    In order to quickly correct shortcomings and improve coal quality, we plan to establish a product quality inspection organization, with special personnel responsible for supervision and inspection. We will also formulate a reward system to reward employees who have contributed to improving quality.

    阳泉矿务局接受批评已经重视提高产煤质量问题
    编辑同志：人民日报十月二十日“读者来信”栏内，中国煤业建筑器材公司通讯组对我局产煤质量低劣提出批评。这个批评是正确的，我们诚恳地接受。今后我们应更进一步提高产煤的质量，降低含石率，以节约国家资财，巩固国营企业的信誉。
    自从中央燃料工业部颁布保质保量的规定后，即引起了我们的注意，在各矿我们设专人拣选，七月下旬，我们并发动了装车工人，在装车时拣石头，特别是在增产节约运动中，我们也发动了生产和装车的工人订保证质量的计划。虽然我们对提高质量做了以上这些工作，但检查起来还存在着严重的单纯任务观点，对提高质量重视不够。
    为迅速纠正缺点，提高产煤质量，我们拟成立产品质量检查组织，设专人负责督促检查。并订出奖励制度，奖励对提高质量有功的职工。
    阳泉矿务局
