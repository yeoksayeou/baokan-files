    Shenyang State-Owned Trading System Reforms Commodity Circulation Organization Work
    Establish Specialized Wholesale Institutions, Implement Wholesale Business for Specialized Commodities
    In order to better leverage the role of connecting industrial and agricultural production, and based on the principles of specialized division of labor and detailed commodity classification to meet the needs of production and life, the various specialized companies of the Shenyang State-Owned Trading System began in April this year to change the previous form of comprehensive companies, establish specialized wholesale institutions, and implement wholesale business for specialized commodities. The Municipal Industrial Materials Company has successively divided its comprehensive hardware and equipment wholesale store into specialized stores for hardware and equipment, chemical raw materials, transportation equipment, electrical equipment, and mechanical instruments. The Municipal Department Store has divided the First and Second Department Store Wholesale Departments into seven specialized wholesale departments for daily sundry goods, clothing and shoes, tobacco, alcohol, tea and food, sports musical instruments, cotton yarn cloth, stationery paper, and glass ceramics, and has transferred them to the management of the Shenyang Wholesale Station. The Municipal Native Produce Company has also divided its operations according to commodity type into specialized warehouses for industrial raw materials, vegetables and fruits, medicinal materials, fur bristles and tails, and native produce, as well as two specialized wholesale departments for aquatic products and livestock products. Facts have proven that this preliminary reform of commodity circulation organization work is entirely necessary.
    1. It has strengthened the enthusiasm of employees to study various commodities, enhanced the planning of supply and marketing work, and promoted the further integration of production and sales. For example, the employees of the Transportation Equipment Store studied the production of automobile tires and the required figures from all aspects (including rubber-wheeled carts in rural areas), and also studied the service life and replacement patterns of tires in different regions, so that they had a clear understanding of operations. This has strengthened the planning of market supply and can also put forward requirements to producers to improve product quality and specifications, promoting the further integration of production and sales.
    2. Because the production and sales situation has been further clarified, the variety of similar commodities can be gradually increased to meet the needs of various consumers, in order to expand sales volume. The variety of commodities operated by the Industrial Materials Company has increased from 8,000 during the comprehensive operation period to more than 14,000. Sales volume has also increased month by month. For example, before the establishment of specialized stores, the average daily sales of the Industrial Materials Company was 100. After the establishment of specialized stores, the daily average in April was 182.6, the average in May was 270, the average in June was 356.5, and the daily average in the third quarter was 391. The Department Store, Native Produce and other specialized wholesale departments are roughly in the same situation.
    3. It simplifies sales procedures and is more convenient for consumers. From the time a commodity is purchased to the time it is sold, it no longer needs to go through the procedures of the Municipal Company's extraction, transportation, pricing, and allocation, but is directly picked up by the specialized wholesale department. This not only accelerates the circulation of commodities, but also greatly facilitates customers. Commodities produced in Shenyang do not need to be put into storage and can be directly transported to the specialized wholesale department, or directly allocated to fixed users by the wholesale department.
    4. Because the division of labor is clear, it is easier for salespersons to become familiar with the business and to cultivate specialized cadres. In the past, during the period of comprehensive operation, the variety of commodities was complex, and the division of labor was not fixed. At that time, it was relatively difficult to study commodity technology and become familiar with commodity knowledge, which fostered the idea of ​​being willing to sell fast-selling goods and not actively promoting slow-selling goods. After the establishment of specialized institutions, this situation underwent tremendous changes, and the operating enthusiasm of all employees immediately increased. The Hardware and Equipment Store used the method of mutual teaching and learning and apprenticeships to learn commodity knowledge, performance and uses, and implemented the "learning from customers" method. This laid the foundation for the cultivation of specialized cadres. The Shenyang Wholesale Station is currently deciding to establish sixteen specialized wholesale departments by the end of November in accordance with the instructions of the Northeast Trade Department.

    沈阳国营贸易系统改革商品流转组织工作
    建立专业批发机构，实行对专门商品的批发业务
    沈阳市国营贸易系统各专业公司为了更好地发挥工农业生产的纽带作用，根据专业分工和把商品划细以适应生产与生活需要的原则，从今年四月份开始，改变过去那种综合公司的形式，建立专业批发机构，实行对专门商品的批发业务。市工业器材公司先后把综合性的五金器材批发商店划分为五金器材、化工原料、交通器材、电工器材、机工仪器等专业商店。市百货公司把第一、二百货批发部划分为日用杂品、服装鞋帽、烟酒茶食、运动乐器、花纱布、文具纸张、玻璃陶瓷等七个专业批发部，并已移交沈阳批发站管理。市土产公司也按照商品种类，划分为工业原料、蔬菜水果、药材、皮毛鬃尾、土产等专业货栈，和水产、畜产两个专业批发部。事实证明，这种商品流转组织工作的初步改革是完全必要的。
    一、它加强了职工钻研各种商品的积极性，增强了供销工作的计划性，促进产销进一步结合。如交通器材商店的职工研究了汽车轮胎的生产情况和各方面的需要数字（包括农村胶皮轮车），并且研究了轮胎在不同地区使用年限及更换的规律，在经营上作到了心中有数。这就加强了供应市场的计划性，并能向生产者提出改进产品质量、规格的要求，促进产销的进一步结合。
    二、由于进一步弄清了产销情况，就可使同类商品的品种逐渐增加，适合各种消费者的需要，以扩大卖钱额。工业器材公司经营商品的品种，已由综合经营时期的八千种增到一万四千多种。销货量也逐月增加。如以专业商店成立前，工业器材公司每日平均卖钱额为一百，在专业商店成立后，四月份每日平均为一八二点六，五月份平均为二七○，六月份平均为三五六点五，第三季度每日平均为三九一。百货、土产等专业批发部大体也是这种情况。
    三、简化了销货手续，对消费者更加便利。商品由进货到销出，不再经过市公司的提运、作价、分拨手续，而直接由专业批发部提货。这不仅加速了商品流转，而且大大便利了顾主。沈阳生产的商品不必入库，即可直接运到专业批发部，或由批发部直接拨给固定用户。
    四、由于分工明确，使营业员便于熟习业务，并能培养专业干部。在过去综合经营时期，商品品种复杂，而分工又不固定，那时钻研商品技术，熟悉商品知识是比较困难的，这就助长了愿意卖顺销货，不积极推销滞销货的思想。在建立专业机构以后，这种情况发生巨大变化，全体职工的经营积极性立即增强了。五金器材商店用互教互学及带徒弟的办法，学习商品知识，性能和用途，并实行了“向顾客学习”的办法。这就打下了培养专业干部的基础。沈阳批发站正根据东北贸易部的指示，决定在十一月底建立十六个专业批发部。
