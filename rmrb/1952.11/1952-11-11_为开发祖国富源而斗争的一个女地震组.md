    A Female Seismological Team Struggles to Develop the Motherland's Rich Resources
    Shao Rui
    In an area where the Qilian Mountains meet the Gobi Desert, a young female seismological team is working arduously. The team, consisting of five members, operates a new Soviet-made seismograph, engaging in a tenacious struggle with nature to unearth the rich oil deposits in Northwest China. For months, they have traversed thousands of miles, from the Loess Plateau in northern Shaanxi to the Gobi Desert in western Gansu, forging themselves to be stronger in the geological exploration activities.
    I was deeply moved when I learned that this advanced Soviet method, which utilizes seismic echoes, electrical currents, and photographic recording to observe the internal structure of geological formations, was being adopted in China for the first time and was being mastered by a group of young women. One weekend in early September, I visited their work site with a geological expert to observe their field operations of electric blasting and held a discussion with the five of them, listening to their accounts of the arduous struggle to master this advanced science and technology:
    They are all young women from the South, around seventeen or eighteen years old. They studied for a short period at the China Petroleum Industry Vocational School in Beijing last year, and this year they came to the Northwest to do internship exploration work. When they blasted for the first time in the Loess Plateau of northern Shaanxi, they were so scared that they hid their heads in the ground. They heard that there were many wolves here, and they were sometimes so afraid that they couldn't sleep. At this time, besides blasting, they had nothing else to do. After blasting, they slept on the loess next to the car, rarely thinking about anything.
    After a period, they began to review their work. They discovered their shortcomings, the most important of which was that they didn't like to use their brains. When they encountered difficult problems, they always relied on the leadership to solve them, and they didn't proactively look for things to do or engage in professional studies in their work. From then on, their minds started working, and they proactively looked for work to do. They strengthened their professional studies, and the more they learned, the more they felt they had learned too little. They participated in the work of pulling "detector lines" (cables). Each person pulled three "detector lines" five hundred meters long, dragging them on the ground. It took several hours to pull them well, and the sheathing was easily worn out. Once, when a line was broken, team leader Tao Lili was so anxious that she almost cried. Later, a comrade told them to wrap the sheathing around their arms, walking and wrapping at the same time, and it would only take half an hour to pull it all. At first, they could only carry two detectors (instruments for detecting earthquakes, weighing about one kilogram each), and they were extremely tired each time. Later, they improved the way they carried the "detectors," and it was no problem to carry five or six at a time. They learned to do simple, heavy work.
    The complex work of learning to master the seismograph began. The technical leader patiently taught them from the beginning. Each of them had to learn seven or eight times to grasp some clues. For example, the "detector" is a new type of instrument with very sensitive sensing. It is buried underground. If people walk around casually far away from it, the detector will be startled and jump. The "seismograph" is a very complex electrical instrument installed in a car, especially since there is a small red light mirror inside it, about the size of a grain of rice, that flashes easily. When the car moves slightly, it disappears. However, after a period of hard study, they finally mastered the key to the entire seismograph.
    The task in the Loess Plateau of northern Shaanxi was completed. They came to the Gobi Desert. In the Loess Plateau of northern Shaanxi, they had to live in cave dwellings; here, they had to live in tents. At that time, it was raining heavily, and sometimes the quilts got wet, so several people squeezed together to sleep. They often ran more than ten kilometers to eat, sometimes soaked like drowned chickens.
    When they first arrived in the Gobi Desert, what they disliked the most were the stone pebbles all over the ground. One day, when they were digging "detector holes" (holes in the ground for burying detectors), many blisters appeared on their hands, and they couldn't dig with a small shovel for a long time. They really felt a little overwhelmed this time. At this time, the captain ran over and said to them with both comfort and encouragement: "Could it be that the female comrades of our seismological team will bow their heads to the difficulties of the Gobi Desert?" So, they bravely mustered their strength again and, with the help of the captain, finally learned the skill of digging holes in the Gobi Desert. The difficulties of the natural conditions were overcome by them, and their work confidence was improved again. Here, they completed their planned task of blasting twelve shots a day and completing the task in a week.
    The tempering of practical work made them stronger. They understood the benefits of improving work methods and established a division of labor system in their work. With the division of labor system, work efficiency was significantly improved; previously, it took more than ten hours to blast twelve shots a day; now, it only takes eight or nine hours. With the remaining time, they can learn to sing and dance and enjoy themselves to the fullest.
    The leadership cares for them very much, and when they discover any problems, they ask them to talk. Under the constant enlightenment and education of the leading comrades, they write diaries every day, analyzing their various ideological changes. They use the stories of various advanced figures to encourage themselves and constantly fight against their various shortcomings. They refuse to return until they have done a good job of recording the seismic data every day. Once, they were still looking for detectors in the field to make records until late at night, and the captain had to find them with a lantern. Sometimes, when the instrument malfunctioned, they were still trying to find a way to repair it with all their might until two or three o'clock in the morning, and they refused to sleep until it was completely repaired.
    Recently, when we visited them next to a small mountain at the foot of the Qilian Mountains, they were concentrating their efforts to strengthen their studies. Chen Jiaqi and Wang Xubi planned to completely clarify all the circuit diagrams on the instrument and further improve their technology. On this day, Wang Xubi sat in the instrument car and skillfully explained the complex instrument operating methods to us. The other three of them were about to be transferred to a new seismic team to operate seismographs. This day was the day of their "five experts'" farewell reunion. They drove a red seismograph vehicle and demonstrated their excellent operating skills. The geological team and drilling team working with them also performed practical operations. Finally, everyone held a get-together and a discussion meeting. A geological expert traveling with us said: This is a new atmosphere that has never existed in China's geological work.

    为开发祖国富源而斗争的一个女地震组
    邵锐
    在祁连山和戈壁滩相接连的一处边缘地带，有一个年轻的女地震组艰苦地工作着。全组一共五个人，掌握着一架苏联制的新式地震仪器，为发掘祖国西北的石油富藏，向大自然做着顽强的斗争。几个月来，她们跋涉了数千华里，从陕北黄土高原到甘肃西部的戈壁滩，在地质勘察活动中，把自己锻炼得更加坚强起来。
    当我知道了这种利用地震回声，通过电流作用，再用照相记录方法来观察地层内部构造的苏联先进方法第一次被中国采用，而且是由一些青年女同志掌握的时候，我深深地感动了。九月上旬的一个周末，我和地质专家一起来到她们的工作现场，参观了她们在野外用电力放炮的操作，并和她们五个人在一起开了座谈会，听她们讲述了掌握这种先进科学技术的艰苦斗争的经过：
    她们，都是十七、八岁左右的南方女孩子。去年在北京中国石油工业专科学校学习了一个短时期，今年她们便来到西北做实习勘察工作。在陕北黄土地带第一次放炮时，她们吓得把头爬在地下。开始听说这儿的狼很多，她们害怕得有时连觉也睡不着。这时候，除了放炮，她们没有什么别的事做，放完了炮，就在汽车边的黄土上睡觉，很少想什么事情。
    过了一个时期，她们开始检讨工作了。她们发现了自己的缺点，最主要的是不爱用脑子，有了困难问题总是依靠领导上来解决，不主动地去找事情做，不善于在工作中进行业务学习。从此以后，她们的脑筋就开动了起来，主动地找工作做。业务学习加强了，越学越感到学的太少。她们参加了拉“检波线”（电缆）的工作。每人一次拉三条，五百公尺长的“检波线”拖在地面上，几个钟头也拉不好，而且还容易把皮线磨破。有一次拉破了线，小组长陶莉莉急得几乎要哭了出来。后来一位同志告诉她们要把皮线绕在胳臂上，一面走动一面绕，只要半个钟头就可以拉光了。最初她们每人只能拿动两个检波器（检验地震的仪器。约重一公斤多）每次还累得不得了，后来她们改进了拿“检波器”的方法，每次拿五、六个也不成问题了。她们学会了做简单粗重的工作。
    学习掌握地震仪器的复杂工作开始了。负责技术的领导人耐心地从头教她们。她们每个人要学七、八遍才能摸到一些门路。譬如“检波器”是一种感觉非常灵敏的新式仪器，它被埋在地下。人们在离它很远的地方随便走动一下，检波器就会惊动得跳起来。“地震仪”是一种装在汽车里，构造非常复杂的电学仪器，特别是它里面有一个像米粒那样大小容易闪来闪去的小红光镜，当汽车稍稍一动的时候，它就不知闪到那儿去了。可是，经过一个时期的艰苦学习，她们终于掌握了全部地震仪器的关键。
    在陕北黄土高原的工作任务完成了。她们来到戈壁滩里。在陕北黄土高原要住窑洞，在这儿要住帐篷。当时正遇上下大雨，被子有时淋湿了，几个人就挤在一块儿睡。她们经常跑十几公里去吃饭，有时淋得好像落汤鸡。
    刚到戈壁滩，她们最讨厌的是那满地的石蛋子。有一天挖“检波洞”（埋检波器的地洞）的时候，手上起了许多泡，用小铲子挖了很久还是挖不动。她们这次确实感到有点吃不消了。这时，队长跑过来连安慰带鼓励地向她们说：“难道咱们地震组的女同志就向戈壁滩这困难低头吗？”于是，她们又勇敢地鼓起劲儿来，在队长帮助下终于学会了在戈壁滩挖洞的本领。自然条件的困难被她们克服了，工作信心又提高了。她们在这儿完成了自己订出的每天放十二炮、一周完成任务的计划。
    实际工作的锻炼使她们更坚强了。她们懂得了改进工作方法的好处，在工作中建立了分工的制度。有了分工制度，工作效率就显著地提高了；以前每天放十二炮，需要十几个钟头；现在只需要八、九个钟头就够了。剩余的时间，她们就可以学习唱歌跳舞，尽情的欢乐。
    领导方面对她们非常关心爱护，发现她们有什么问题时，就找她们来谈话。在领导同志不断的启发教育下，她们每天写日记，分析自己的各种思想变化，她们拿各种先进人物的故事来勉励自己，不断地和自己的各种缺点作斗争。每天她们不把地震记录做好就不肯回来。有一次直到深夜她们还在野外找检波器做记录，最后还是队长亲自提着马灯才把她们找了回来。有时仪器发生了毛病，她们直到深夜两三点钟，还在那里一股劲儿想办法来修理，不完全修好总是不肯睡觉。
    最近当我们在祁连山下的一个小山旁访问她们的时候，她们正在集中火力加强学习。陈家骐和王旭壁计划把仪器上所有的线路图都完全弄清楚，进一步来提高自己的技术。这一天王旭壁坐在仪器车上，很熟练地给我们讲解了复杂的仪器操作方法。她们中间的另外三个人马上要调到一个新的地震队去操作地震仪器。这一天是她们“五位专家”临别团聚的日子。她们开着一辆红色的地震仪器车，表演了她们精彩的操作技术。和她们配合在一起的地质队和钻井组也一同做了实际操作的表演。最后大家在一起开了联欢会和座谈会。和我们同行的一位地质专家说：这是中国地质工作中从来未有的一种新气象。
