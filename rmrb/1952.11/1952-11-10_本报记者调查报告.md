This Newspaper Reporter's Investigation Report

    A letter from a group of workers at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, as investigated and proven by our newspaper's reporter, reveals that the workers are indeed working in an environment that is extremely poor in terms of safety and hygiene, and their health has been severely damaged. A number can illustrate this: according to the statistics from the plant's hospital outpatient department, the number of work-related injuries and illnesses in the entire plant last year was 2,188, while in the first six months of this year alone, it reached 2,870. It is especially noteworthy that the number of worker injuries has been rising monthly from January to July of this year, with the number in July being twice that of January.
    The safety and hygiene problems of the "five types" of workers mentioned in the workers' letter are long-standing serious problems in the plant. Since Liberation, the leadership of the iron and steel plant has considered some ways to solve these problems. For example, masks, protective glasses, and raincoats were issued to crushing workers and workers on the coke ovens; eggs and health meals were provided to workers in the coke by-product department, and white oil for facial application was provided for protection against poison. However, none of these measures completely solved the problem. Masks cannot prevent workers from breathing dust and gas, and white oil cannot prevent workers' faces from being corroded by asphalt smoke. The workers' demands for improved safety and hygiene equipment are extremely urgent. When the reporter visited Ji Yongchun, a worker who crushes ore, he deliberately spat out a mouthful of red phlegm and said, "The problem of us breathing red ore powder must be solved quickly, otherwise we will all get lung disease."
    To understand whether the workers' demands were too high, the reporter conducted a special investigation. The reporter believes that the workers' demands are not excessive at all. The problems they raised are urgent issues that seriously threaten their lives. The key is that the plant's leading cadres have long failed to understand the workers' suffering. As for the relatively easy-to-solve problems such as workers drinking boiled water and taking showers, they have not been completely resolved to this day. The toilet problem, which was criticized by this newspaper, has still not been resolved. The toilets are dirty and few in number, with an average of one toilet hole for every hundred people. However, when asked about it, the workers all said: It's almost enough, we will find our own ways to solve the difficulties.
    Is there no way to improve the safety and hygiene problems in these work departments raised by the workers? The reporter agrees with the workers' opinion: "Absolutely not." Admittedly, under the old production equipment conditions and the current material conditions, it is very difficult to completely improve safety and hygiene equipment. But some of these difficulties can be overcome, and even if they cannot be completely overcome, appropriate improvement measures can be devised. The reason why the safety and hygiene work of the iron and steel plant has not been improved as it should be is mainly because the plant's leading cadres do not pay attention to the safety and health of the workers, and they do not have a correct understanding of the relationship between improving production and protecting labor. The following is a typical example of not paying attention to workers' safety and hygiene:
    The problem of workers in the crucible stone crushing workshop of the refractory materials department breathing dust has long caused great pain to the workers. After Liberation, the workers held great hope and asked the leadership to solve the dust prevention problem that had not been solved for a long time during the enemy-puppet period. In 1950, a responsible comrade of the Central Iron and Steel Industry Bureau once instructed the plant director, Li Feiping, to pay attention to the workers' demands and seriously solve this problem. The workers and technicians also made some efforts to solve this problem. Based on their own research and the experience gained from visiting other factories, they proposed a thorough dust prevention method of converting wet grinding into dry grinding. Plant Director Li Feiping always delayed it. Later, although he approved the installation, when the drawings had been completed and some large parts had been manufactured, the plant director said when reviewing the budget for installing the grinder that he was not prepared to install a dry grinder in 1951. A technician created an automatic air sieve that could replace manual sieving, which not only involved a smaller project but also greatly reduced dust. However, the plant director refused to adopt this relatively usable temporary method because it could not completely solve the dust problem. When the refractory materials department handed over the official document approved by the Central Iron and Steel Industry Bureau (asking the factory to consider installing a dry grinder) and the workers' request to the factory director, the factory director did not even look at it and said: "Installing a dry grinder is not a problem that can be solved all at once, let's talk about it later." After that, no matter what the workers asked for, the factory director just ignored it.
    Regarding the "red people's" demands, the reporter also asked a factory director, and his answer was: "In the past, I often didn't have time to consider safety and hygiene issues because production was too busy. I think the 'red people's' safety and hygiene equipment is not likely to cause accidents, so it can be postponed." His thinking is very clear: he only cares about production and not the health of the workers.
    The leadership of the iron and steel plant has long neglected safety and hygiene work. From Liberation until September of this year, the leading cadres of the iron and steel plant have never put the factory's safety and hygiene work on the agenda for discussion at a specific meeting. The factory has neither a clear direction nor a comprehensive plan for solving safety and hygiene problems. Although the factory has established organizational structures such as safety and hygiene sections, these organizations cannot function because the leadership does not pay attention to them, there is no specific leadership, and cadres are not properly assigned. Han Baoru, a cadre of the labor protection department of the trade union, once suggested to the factory directors: the safety and hygiene section should have a work plan. One factory director said:
    "Our cadres have a low level and cannot make a plan. What can we do?" Another factory director said: "Opening more meetings will solve the problem. We don't need a plan." As a result, they showed great passivity in solving safety and hygiene problems, only treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts, and they could not fundamentally solve any major problems. Many accidents that should not have happened also happened. For example, on August 23 this year, Gao Ming, a worker who was interning in the rolling mill department, broke two toes because he was not wearing protective leather shoes. In fact, as early as August 7, the department had requested the factory to issue him safety clothing, but the factory delayed it until the accident happened without issuing it.
    It should be pointed out that the broad masses of workers' active demands for improving safety and hygiene work have recently attracted the attention of the leading cadres of the iron and steel plant. In October, the factory's leaders at all levels began to make plans to improve safety and hygiene equipment, preparing to gradually implement them.
    The reporter believes that the responsible cadres of the factory trade union have not played their due role in supervising the administrative leaders' neglect of workers' safety and hygiene work. After accidents occurred, the trade union did raise opinions; but after the accidents passed, they did not insist on correcting or supervising the administration to improve safety and hygiene work. The trade union also did a very poor job in safety and hygiene education for workers, which caused some avoidable accidents to happen repeatedly.
    From the above situation, the leading cadres of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant must strengthen their reliance on the working class and correct the one-sided view of simply emphasizing production and neglecting labor protection (this view is essentially capitalist thinking). Otherwise, not only will safety and hygiene work not be improved, but production will also not be improved. Therefore, we suggest that the leading cadres of the iron and steel plant, in addition to conducting ideological self-examination, should seriously accept workers' opinions, thoroughly inspect the safety and hygiene work of the entire plant, distinguish between priorities and urgencies, immediately improve the work that can be improved, and also report the work that cannot be improved to the higher-level leading organs for consideration and resolution. At the same time, they should improve the security and hygiene organization and system in order to lay the foundation for regular work.

    本报记者调查报告
    太原钢铁厂一群工人的来信，经本报记者调查证明：工人们的确是在安全卫生十分恶劣的环境中工作着，身体健康已经受到了严重的损害。这里有一个数字可以说明：据该厂医院门诊部统计，去年全厂工伤疾病的人数是二、一八八人，而今年一至六月即达二、八七○人。尤其值得注意的，是今年一月到七月，工人工伤的数字在逐月上升，七月份为一月份的二倍。
    工人们来信中提到的“五种”工人的安全卫生问题，是该厂由来已久的严重问题。解放以来，钢铁厂领导方面为了解决这些问题，是想过一些办法的。如：给粉碎工人和焦炉上工人发口罩、防护眼镜和雨衣；给炼焦副产工人吃鸡蛋和保健饭，给配了防毒用的涂脸的白油。但是这一些办法，都没有完全解决问题。口罩不能防止工人呼吸尘土和煤气，白油不能防止工人的脸被沥青烟腐蚀。工人们对于改善安全卫生设备的要求是十分迫切的，当记者访问粉碎矿石工人姬永春时，他特意吐出一口红痰说：“我们呼吸红矿粉的问题，一定要很快的解决，不然我们都要得肺病了。”
    为了了解工人的要求是不是过高，记者特地做了调查。记者认为，工人的要求一点也不过分。他们所提出的问题，都是严重地威胁着他们生命的迫切问题，关键在于厂的领导干部长期不能体会工人的困苦。至于工人喝开水、洗澡等比较容易解决的问题，到现在也未得到彻底解决，厕所问题经本报提出批评，也还是没有解决，厕所既脏，数量又少，平均一百多人才有一个便洞。可是问起工人时，他们都说：差不多了，有困难我们自己想办法解决吧。
    对于工人所提出的这些工作部门的安全卫生问题，是不是没有办法改善呢？记者同意工人的意见：“完全不是的”。固然，在旧的生产设备状况和现在的物质条件之下，要彻底改善安全卫生设备是有很多困难的。但这些困难有的是可以克服的，有的即或不能完全克服，也能想出适当的改善办法。钢铁厂的安全卫生工作所以没能得到应有的改善，主要是由于厂的领导干部对工人们的安全和健康问题不重视，对提高生产和保护劳动的关系没有正确的认识。下面就是一个不重视工人安全卫生的典型事例：
    耐火材料部粉碎坩子石车间工人呼吸尘土的问题，长期给工人带来莫大的痛苦。解放后，工人抱着很大的希望，要求领导方面解决他们在敌伪时期长期不得解决的防尘问题，一九五○年中央钢铁工业局某负责同志，曾经面嘱该厂厂长李非平重视工人的要求，认真解决这个问题。工人与技术员为了解决这个问题也都作了一些努力，他们根据自己的研究和参观其他厂取得的经验，提出把湿碾改装成干碾的彻底防尘的办法。厂长李非平老是一味拖延，后来虽然批准安装；但当图样已经绘制完，并且制造了一部分大件机件之后，厂长在审核编造安装机碾的预算时，却又说一九五一年不准备安装干碾了。有一个技术人员，创制了自动风筛，可以代替人工筛粉，不但工程较小，而且可以大大减轻尘土的飞扬；可是厂长却又以不能彻底解决尘土问题而拒绝采用这个比较可用的临时办法。耐火材料部又把中央钢铁工业局批示的公文（让厂方考虑安装干碾）和工人们的要求书交给厂长时，厂长连看都不看地说：“安装干碾不是一下能解决的问题，以后再说吧。”此后，无论工人怎样的要求，厂长就是
    一直不理了。
    关于“红人”的要求问题，记者也曾问过一个厂长，他的回答是：“我过去常常因为生产太忙，没时间考虑安全卫生问题。我认为‘红人’的安全卫生设备不好发生不了事故，可以往后拖一拖。”他的思想很明确，他是只管生产，不管工人健康的。
    钢铁厂领导方面对安全卫生工作是长期忽视的。从解放以后直到今年九月止，钢铁厂的领导干部，从未把厂里的安全卫生工作，提到一定的会议上讨论过。厂里在解决安全卫生问题上，既没有明确的方针，也没有统盘的计划。厂里虽成立了安全、卫生科等组织机构，因为领导不重视，没有具体的领导，干部配备不当，因此这些组织也就不能发挥作用。工会劳保部干部韩葆如曾向厂长们建议：安全、卫生科要有工作计划。有一个厂长说：
    “我们的干部水平低，作不出来计划有啥办法？”又有一个厂长说：“多开一些会就解决问题了，不要计划也可以。”因而在解决安全卫生问题时表现了极大的被迫性，只是头痛医头、脚痛医脚，更谈不上从根本上解决什么重大的问题，许多不应该发生的事故也就发生了。如今年八月二十三日，在轧钢部实习的工人高明，因为没有穿防护皮鞋，把脚趾压断两个。其实，早在八月七日该部就请求厂里给他发安全服装，厂里一直拖延，直到发生事故时也没有发下来。
    应该指出：广大工人对改进安全卫生工作的积极要求，最近已经引起钢铁厂领导干部的注意。十月间，该厂里各级领导干部开始制作改善安全卫生设备的计划，准备逐步付之实施。
    记者认为：厂工会的负责干部，对行政领导干部忽视工人安全卫生工作也没有起到应有的监督作用。发生事故后，工会虽曾提出意见；但事故过去了，即不坚持纠正或监督行政上改善安全卫生工作。工会对工人的安全卫生教育工作做的也很差，这就使有些可以避免的事故重复发生了。
    从以上的情况看，太原钢铁厂的领导干部必须加强依靠工人阶级的观点，纠正单纯强调生产忽视劳动保护的片面观点（这个观点，实质上是资本主义思想），否则不仅安全卫生工作不能改善，而且生产也不能搞好。因此我们建议：钢铁厂的领导干部除应从思想上进行检查外，应认真接受工人意见，彻底检查全厂的安全卫生工作，分别轻重缓急，可以改进的工作立即改进，无力改进的工作，亦应呈报上级领导机关考虑解决。同时，应健全保安卫生的组织和制度，以便打下经常工作的基础。
