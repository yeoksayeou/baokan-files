Xinhua News Agency, November 25th, Dispatch from New York: On November 23rd, the Soviet delegation proposed a revision to the Soviet proposal regarding the Korean question. This revision is a supplementary clause to be inserted after the preamble and serve as the first section of the main text of the Soviet proposal. This new supplementary clause of the Soviet proposal states that the United Nations General Assembly considers it necessary to: "Recommend that the warring parties in Korea immediately and completely cease fire in accordance with the draft armistice agreement already agreed upon by both parties, that is, both parties cease all military actions on land, sea, and air, and the issue of the repatriation of prisoners of war should be handed over to the committee for the peaceful settlement of the Korean question as stipulated in the Soviet proposal, and all issues in this committee should be decided by a two-thirds majority of all members."

Xinhua News Agency, November 25th, Dispatch from Moscow: "Izvestia" commentator Mikhailov, commenting on the arguments of reactionary American newspapers about the "crisis of the United Nations," wrote: The root of these arguments is the fear of the Anglo-American bloc because the contradictions within the imperialist camp reflected in the United Nations are increasing, and the crisis of the imperialist colonial system is becoming more acute day by day, making them very panicked. The American delegation prepared the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly according to American intentions. It exerted the most shameless pressure on other countries before the opening of the assembly and constantly increased this pressure during the session. The American ruling group is trying hard to use the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly as a tool of their aggressive policies. However, they cannot fail to see that there are many new difficulties on their path. First of all, it should be pointed out that the discussion of the Korean question in the Political Committee of the General Assembly did not proceed as planned by American imperialism. The Soviet delegation has completely exposed the true face of the American aggressors who are unwilling to achieve peace in Korea in order to obtain billions of dollars in profits before the whole world. Despite all the behind-the-scenes tricks played by the American delegation, it still did not obtain the necessary votes to pass its proposal in the Political Committee. The attitude of some Asian countries on the issue of their relations with imperialism is causing considerable concern to the American ruling group. Colonial countries have suffered defeats in the General Assembly Political Committee's vote on proposals concerning racial discrimination in the Union of South Africa, and they fear that they will suffer the same defeats on the issues of Tunisia and Morocco. Colonialists suffered a new defeat in the Trusteeship Council a few days ago. Despite their opposition, the Trusteeship Council passed a resolution on non-self-governing and trust territories. Because the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly did not proceed according to the "plan" of the U.S. State Department, the American delegation is trying in every possible way to disrupt the discussion of the most important international issues and attempting to bring the assembly to a hasty conclusion. America's policy in the United Nations openly intends to turn the United Nations, an institution of international cooperation, into an institution to cover up American aggressive actions. But the forces of peace are waging a struggle for peace in the United Nations despite all difficulties. The Soviet delegation is the leader of this noble struggle.

### 对苏联关于朝鲜问题的提案  苏联代表团提出补充条款

    对苏联关于朝鲜问题的提案
    苏联代表团提出补充条款
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：十一月二十三日，苏联代表团对苏联关于朝鲜问题的提案提出了一项修正，这项修正是一个补充条款，要插在序言之后，作为苏联提案主文的第一节。苏联提案这条新补充的条款说，联合国大会认为必须：“建议朝鲜的交战双方按照双方已经同意的停战协定草案，立即完全停火，就是说双方停止一切陆、海、空军事行动，战俘遣返的问题应交给苏联提案所规定的和平解决朝鲜问题委员会去解决，在这个委员会中一切问题要经全体成员三分之二多数赞成决定。”
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“消息报”评论员米哈依洛夫评论美国反动报纸关于“联合国的危机”的论调时写道：这种论调的根源是美英集团的恐惧，因为在联合国里面反映出来的帝国主义阵营的矛盾越来越多，同时帝国主义殖民制度的危机，也一天天地变得更尖锐，使得它们很是恐慌。美国代表团曾按照美国的意图准备联合国第七届大会。它在大会开幕前就曾对其他国家施行最无耻的压力，并在联大开会期间不断增加这种压力。美国统治集团正极力利用联合国第七届大会，使它成为他们的侵略政策的工具。不过，他们不能不看到，他们的道路上存在着不少新的困难。首先应该指出的是，大会政治委员会关于朝鲜问题的讨论，完全不是按照美帝国主义所计划的那样进行的。苏联代表团已在全世界面前，把为了取得几十亿美元利润而不愿在朝鲜达成和平的美国侵略者的真面目完全揭露出来了。尽管美国代表团在幕后不知玩了多少鬼花样，它还是没有取得使它的提案能在政治委员会上通过的必要的票数。有些亚洲国家在它们与帝国主义关系的问题上所持的态度，使得美国统治集团相当忧虑。在大会政治委员会表决关于南非联邦的种族歧视的提案时，殖民国家已遭到失败，它们害怕在突尼斯和摩洛哥问题上也将遭到同样的失败。殖民主义者前几天在托管委员会也遭到了新的失败，尽管他们一味反对，托管委员会仍然通过了一个关于非自治地区与托管地区的决议。由于联合国第七届大会并未按照美国国务院的“计划”进行，美国代表团正多方设法破坏大会关于最重要的国际问题的讨论，并企图使大会草草结束。美国在联合国的政策竟公然打算把联合国这个国际合作的机构变为掩盖美国侵略行动的机构。但是和平的力量正不顾一切困难在联合国进行争取和平的斗争。苏联代表团正是这种崇高斗争的领导者。
