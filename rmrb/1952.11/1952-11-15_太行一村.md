    Taihang Village

    A Large Cooperative
    Yaoshanggou has a large agricultural production cooperative. Of the village's 221 peasant households, 173 have already joined the cooperative. The cooperative manages 78% of the village's land—over 2,500 mu—as well as more than a dozen earthenware casserole kilns and a livestock business of 700-800 sheep.
    When I first arrived in Yaoshanggou, I worried whether such a large cooperative could be managed well. After learning the situation, I realized that my worries were unnecessary. The Yaoshanggou agricultural production cooperative is doing very well. The members are all working actively and enthusiastically, caring for, criticizing, and helping each other. On my second day in Yaoshanggou, several members wanted me to see their newly completed reservoir: "Go and see it, it's very big, the bottom is plastered with lime." "Before, we depended on the weather to farm, but now it listens to us and waters our fields." This is indeed a large reservoir, capable of storing more than 40,000 dan of water, protecting the surrounding 300 mu of crops from the threat of drought. Yaoshanggou is located on a high mountain ridge, and most of its land is on the top and slopes of the mountain. Although there are springs and wells at the foot of the mountain, digging wells on the mountain, even to a depth of 10 zhang, you still can't see a drop of water. People rely entirely on drought cellars to store rainwater and snow. For thousands of years, people have been threatened by drought. In earlier years, some people advocated digging reservoirs to store rainwater and use it to water crops during droughts. However, small pools were ineffective, and digging large pools required too much effort. This year, the agricultural production cooperative has grown to more than 170 households, and with increased strength, they started digging the pool in late July. The day it was completed was "August 1st" Army Day, and the villagers held a grand meeting to celebrate. They all said: if it weren't for the Communist Party leading us to organize the agricultural production cooperative and the People's Liberation Army protecting our good times, we could never have built this reservoir. Let's call it the "August 1st Reservoir." Everyone also wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, thanking him and the Communist Party for bringing happiness to Yaoshanggou Village. This year, the crops in Yaoshanggou are growing exceptionally well. The 2,500 mu of land of the agricultural production cooperative will have an average yield of 2.4 shi per mu, more than double that before the War of Resistance Against Japan, and more than 40% higher than last year. When I visited Yaoshanggou, the agricultural production cooperative had finished cultivating the large fields and was waiting to start harvesting. The members are now concentrating on cutting artemisia to press into fertilizer and plowing wheat fields in preparation for planting wheat. This year, the cooperative planted a total of 760 mu of autumn wheat, of which 15.5 mu will be used to create a new record for wheat yields next year, reaching 1,000 jin per mu, and another 178 mu will be cultivated as high-yield land. On September 1st, a few days before wheat planting, Wang Jinyun convened a meeting of the cultivation team leaders to check the preparations for wheat planting. The work of each team is proceeding smoothly: the wheat fields have been plowed two to three times, the seeds have been dried in the sun more than three times, and the copper sulfate and Ceresan used for seed disinfection have been prepared. The only thing that hasn't met the cooperative's requirements is fertilizer—250 dan per mu for the "new record" land and 150 dan for the high-yield land are ready, but the general wheat fields only have 70 dan per mu, which is 20 dan short. However, each team is using every possible method to make up for the missing fertilizer. The Han Jinmu cultivation team decided to "pen the sheep for three more nights and dismantle three kang to solve the problem"; the Shi Huayuan team has mobilized the women and children in the team to sweep up garbage, collect sheep manure, and cut firewood for two more days to smoke fertilizer, making up for the missing quantity. Each team has its own methods, and they have already begun to implement them. On September 6th, during the second inspection, the ordinary wheat fields had an average of 83 dan of fertilizer per mu, only 7 dan short. The team leaders said: "There are still four or five days before wheat planting, we guarantee to exceed the cooperative's fertilization plan, and we must not fail to reach it."
    One night, it was raining outside, and I was awakened by shouts, and Wang Jinyun, who was sleeping in the same room as me, also woke up. He listened and told me:
    "This is calling people to get up and collect the sunflower seeds drying on the threshing ground. The cooperative has already harvested a lot of sunflower seeds in the past few days."
    "Who is calling people to get up?"
    He listened carefully and said, "There's Shuan Suo, there's Haiyan—quite a few people," he paused and added, "Whoever hears it first gets up and calls."
    The members already care about everything in the agricultural production cooperative as much as they care about their own families. Old Wang also told me about many model actions of members who put the cooperative first and forget themselves: take Liu Haiyan, for example, the two mu of vegetable land he left behind are not growing well, there are weeds, but he doesn't delay the collective labor of the cooperative for a single day. He said that if those two mu of land don't grow well, it's his own loss, but if the cooperative's land doesn't grow well, everyone will suffer. He decided "next year, I will only leave a little bit of land enough to grow vegetables for myself, so as not to be distracted." And then there's Shi Huaiwang—that young man who got married not long ago. This spring, when the cooperative called on members to take out their surplus grain and money to temporarily lend to the cooperative to buy public plowing cattle, his family took out four shi of rice. At that time, he said: "The cooperative has made my life better, I can't finish eating the grain, I'll lend out a little more."
    The members actively and enthusiastically participate in the collective labor of the cooperative, consciously complete the cooperative's production plan, and care about the agricultural production cooperative as much as they care about their own families. This is an important reason why the Yaoshanggou agricultural production cooperative is doing well. But how did the members' high level of ideological awareness grow?
    "Mainly because of the Party's many years of education of the masses," Wang Jinyun said. His memory is really good. He remembers very clearly all the revolutionary struggles, work, and movements that the Party has led the masses to carry out since the establishment of the Yaoshanggou branch in 1938. The Yaoshanggou branch has always attached great importance to ideological education of the peasants. In 1943, the Japanese invaders occupied Panlong Town, eight li away from the village, and built a blockhouse on the edge of Yaoshanggou Village. The branch encouraged the masses' fighting spirit, strengthened the masses' confidence in victory, and led the masses to create the fighting art of the "cave defense war." They persisted in fighting for eight months, cooperated with the Eighth Route Army to remove the enemy strongholds on the edge of the village, drove out the enemy in Panlong Town, killed and wounded more than 80 Japanese invaders, and captured more than a dozen alive, becoming a model village in the struggle against the enemy. In 1947, the branch led the masses to dig up the roots of poverty and find the roots of wealth, abolished the feudal land system, and implemented land reform, so that all the peasants in the village received the land they deserved. The Yaoshanggou branch's leadership in labor mutual assistance, since Chairman Mao issued the call to "get organized," has responded enthusiastically and promoted it actively. Since the organization of mutual aid groups began in 1944, the village's labor mutual assistance movement has developed and improved year by year. Last year, based on the village's seven years of experience in labor mutual assistance and the fact that 80% of the farmers had been organized, under the strong leadership of the Party at the higher level, the agricultural production cooperative was established with Wang Jinyun as the head and 21 farmers participating. Because of the Party's long-term political work among the peasants and the great influence of Wang Jinyun's agricultural production cooperative, this year it has developed into a large agricultural production cooperative including 78% of the farmers and 173 members.
    "It's not enough to run the cooperative well just because the masses have a high ideological awareness," Wang Jinyun said at the end of his conversation: "There must also be the backbone role of Party members and the guarantee of various systems."
    I have also learned about this aspect of the situation in the past few days. There are 38 Party members in the village, all of whom are role models for the masses. Their model deeds are endless. This fact alone is enough to see the point: since the land reform, none of the 38 Party members have hired a long-term worker, none have lent money at high interest rates, none have rented out land, and none have not participated in mutual aid groups. After the establishment of the agricultural production cooperative, except for a small number of Party members who the branch decided still needed to stay in the mutual aid groups to lead the masses who had not yet joined the cooperative to carry out mutual aid production, all of them participated in the agricultural production cooperative.
    The Yaoshanggou agricultural production cooperative has many good experiences, especially their experience in organizing labor. Wang Jinyun said: "As long as we can make the members work actively, even a large cooperative can be run well." Their organization of labor mainly has three experiences—on the basis of the members' consciousness, they combine the principle of more work, more pay, with the contract farming system of quota management. The day I arrived in Yaoshanggou was the day the cooperative began "checking the fields, evaluating the work, and setting the output." This is an important preparation for next year's production. The cooperative's leaders: the director, production team leaders, technicians, chief accountants, and others, organized themselves into a "field inspection and output evaluation team" and went to each piece of land to carefully evaluate what it would be suitable for planting next year, how much output it could have, how much labor it would require, and how much rent should be paid to the landowners. After the preliminary decision, it was handed over to each production team and cultivation group for discussion, and finally passed at the members' meeting. "This is very important work," Hao Donglian—a branch committee member, chairman of the women's federation, and deputy director of the cooperative—told me: "Whether we do a good job in many of our cooperative's tasks next year depends entirely on how well we evaluate this time."
    After the "field inspection, work evaluation, and output setting" is passed by the members' meeting, it is distributed to each production team and then to each cultivation group. Each team and group then formulates its own plan based on the cooperative's cultivation requirements and output plan. If the cooperative stipulates that a piece of land requires 20 workdays, but only 15 workdays are actually used, and the quality standards are met, the cooperative will still pay remuneration according to 20 workdays when distributing the harvest in the autumn; if the cooperative stipulates that the output per mu of a piece of land is 3 shi, but the actual harvest is 4 shi, the excess part will be distributed to the team members using the method of bonus rewards. Because the cultivation responsibility system is implemented on the basis of the members' awareness, and the principle of more work, more pay is implemented using the methods of quota management and bonus rewards, this greatly strengthens the members' sense of responsibility and improves the members' labor enthusiasm. Although Yaoshanggou Village is composed of four natural villages that are far apart, and people live very scattered, although the Yaoshanggou agricultural production cooperative is so large, this cooperative is still doing very well.
    "Report to Chairman Mao..."
    After seeing the achievements of the agricultural production cooperative and understanding the Party's leadership and education of the peasants, there is no longer any surprise or doubt about the prosperous and happy life of the peasants in Yaoshanggou Village. However, in order to be cautious, I carefully corrected the situation, materials, and impressions of various things I learned in the village for the last time. The day before I left Yaoshanggou Village, I talked with Comrade Wang Jinyun, the secretary of the branch, for half a day. I asked him: Why hasn't there been class differentiation in Yaoshanggou since the land reform, only rising living standards? Why have old ideas, customs, and habits been replaced by new ideas, new customs, and new habits so quickly?
    Wang Jinyun did not answer me immediately. He tilted his head and pondered. This is his habit. No matter what work he does or what problems he solves, he always thinks about it carefully and considers it thoroughly before starting to work. Since he took office as the secretary of the Yaoshanggou Village branch in 1947, the various tasks in the village have progressed year by year, and the branch has truly become the core of leading the masses forward. It has been selected as a model branch in the county for several years in a row, and Wang Jinyun has also become a person loved and trusted by the masses. Since 1950, he has been selected as a model cadre and labor model in Shanxi Province. Because he is usually quiet and taciturn, and thinks deeply, the villagers affectionately call him "the staff officer."
    "Mainly because of getting organized," Wang Jinyun said.
    "But some villages have gotten organized, and there is still class differentiation."
    "I can't tell you the reason right away," he said, "I'll tell you a few things..."
    The year before last, such a thing happened in the village: After six or seven years of labor mutual assistance, land yields increased. In 1948, each mu only produced 9 dou 5 sheng and 9 he, but in 1950 it increased to 1 shi 3 dou and 8 sheng, not only healing the serious war wounds, but also making people's lives prosperous. Many people began to buy land. That year, a total of 74 peasant households bought 179 mu of land. Only nine households in the village sold land—two lost money in speculative livestock trading, three needed travel expenses to go far away, etc., selling a total of 24 mu of land, most of which was bought from outside the village. The branch felt that this situation was not right and specifically convened a meeting to study this issue. Wang Jinyun said to all the Party members: "We want to get rich, but we don't want others to become poor. If we keep buying land from outside the village, won't we make them poor?" As a result of the discussion, the Party members all said that they would no longer buy land, and at the same time, they advised the peasants to stop buying land from outside the village. "How can we meet the masses' requirements for developing production if we don't buy land?" The meeting decided to guide the peasants to further organize themselves, increase land yields, and meet the masses' requirements. In the spring of the following year, the agricultural production cooperative was established with Wang Jinyun as the head. In the first year, the output of the agricultural production cooperative increased to 1 shi 7 dou and 6 sheng per mu. Facts educated the peasants: If you want to develop production, you don't necessarily have to buy more land. Organizing an agricultural production cooperative can increase income and improve life. This guided the masses to the road of land processing, technological reform, and organizing agricultural production cooperatives, avoiding the class differentiation that would inevitably be caused by a large amount of land purchase, and embarking on the road of common development and universal prosperity.
    When people have just begun to build their new lives, and the building of happiness has not yet been completed, sudden disasters and illnesses often make people's lives difficult. In the past four years, seven people in the village, including Li Peiming and Zhang Xianyuan, have suffered from relatively long-term illnesses, not only unable to go to the fields to work, but also spending more than 2 million yuan on medical expenses. If they were not helped, these seven families would have difficulties, or even sell their land and become poor peasants. People who have shared joys and sorrows and shared difficulties in the long-term struggle against the enemy, the struggle against feudal landlords, and the struggle against natural disasters, care for each other and are connected heart to heart. When the branch called for helping households in difficulty, everyone rushed to respond, and several families took out money to lend to these seven households, "Repay it whenever you have it, no interest." The mutual aid group members helped them with farming, and after the autumn harvest, they gave them wages. With the care and help of the whole village, the lives of the seven farmers who had been sick for a long time did not encounter great difficulties, nor did they decline.
    Many old customs, especially weddings and funerals, were very extravagant. Weddings required gifts, dowries, and big banquets—euphemistically called "drinking wedding wine"; as for funerals, they were even more serious. People would habitually say: "I've worked hard all my life, I can't bear to spend money, but when I die, I should be glorious." If you died of your parents, you wouldn't be able to put on a show, and you would be said to be "unfilial." Often, some families went bankrupt after holding a wedding or funeral. A long time ago, the Yaoshanggou branch paid attention to reforming this old custom. In the past four years, 17 people have died in the village and 62 babies have been born, but under the advocacy of the branch, there has been little in the way of giving gifts, holding big banquets, or being extravagant. Things have been done well under the principle of "spending less money and doing big things." People still can't forget and are still talking about Shi Huaiwang's marriage. They all said: "The new-style marriage is really good. The two of them went hand in hand to the district to get a certificate, and held a meeting to get things done. It's both glorious and saves money."
    Wang Jinyun said: "We try to save as much as possible in this area, but we are never afraid to spend money on production and construction." He said that after the land reform, Yaoshanggou repaired and built 145 new houses and new kilns, increased 32 plowing cattle, 520 sheep, thousands of old farm tools, and dozens of new farm tools such as new-style plows, sprayers, grass cutters, and threshers. Investment in land, fertilizer alone, has increased from the original 40 to 50 dan of grain to 100 dan, an increase of a full double.
    The Yaoshanggou Village area was the most solid base area during the War of Resistance Against Japan. When the Eighth Route Army first entered North China, Commander-in-Chief Zhu and the headquarters lived in Wangjiayu Village, eight li away from Yaoshanggou. From that time on, the people of Yaoshanggou began their new lives. People know that their happiness and the People's Army are flesh and blood, and people care about the lives of military families more than they care about themselves. Since 1949, Yaoshanggou has been a model village for farming on behalf of military families. In some villages, military families have become difficult because of a lack of labor, but in Yaoshanggou, military families not only do not have difficulties in their lives, but their land yields are higher than the masses' yields, and their lives are better than the masses'. Of the 47 military families in the village, 17 enjoy the preferential treatment of farming on their behalf due to a lack of labor. These 17 households have never sold production materials due to difficulties in their lives, and three households have more than 10 shi of surplus grain, and the rest are enough to eat and use or have a little surplus. That day when I went to visit the military family Xu Lamei, I met Han Wanliang, the leader of the cultivation team. His team was farming 8.5 mu of land on behalf of the military family Han Shuanzhu. He said that in order to make the military family's land get higher yields, they automatically donated 60 dan of fertilizer to Han Shuanzhu, and the team members paid for a night of sheep penning. They cultivated one mu of corn into high-yield land, which can harvest 900 jin; 6 mu of autumn fields (the two mu were originally wheat fields) can harvest 20 shi this year, which is 1 shi higher per mu than the average yield of the masses. Although the village's work of farming on behalf of military families is a "contract farming and production system," the team members give the excess part completely to the military families and don't want any of it themselves. When asked why, Team Leader Han Wanliang said: "Doing a good job in farming on behalf of military families is also resisting America and aiding Korea." He took out a notebook from his pocket and pointed to a page with his thick fingers for me to see. It turned out that it was their patriotic convention, in which the article on farming on behalf of military families was: "The work of farming on behalf of military families must be done well, three plowing and four hoeing must be done accurately. Topdressing, carrying water for irrigation, removing diseased plants to protect the autumn seedlings, the military families' land is high-yielding, that is resisting America and aiding Korea."
    The next day, I went to the county with Comrade Wang Jinyun—I was going back to Beijing, and he was going to the county to attend the 9th People's Congress. At first, we looked at the crops ripening in the early autumn sun and chatted about everything. But after walking for a while, Old Wang became silent. I thought he was tired, so I stopped talking. Gradually, I realized that he was thinking about something important, and it seemed like he wanted to tell me something important. He walked to the front of me in a hurry for a while, and then fell behind me again. He wanted to say something several times, but stopped again several times.
    "Is there anything wrong?" I asked him.
    "I miss Beijing, I miss Chairman Mao," he said thoughtfully, "Do you think I can go to Beijing? Can I see Chairman Mao?"
    I didn't expect him to ask such a question, and I didn't know how to answer him for a while. But Jinyun didn't wait for me to answer and continued to say:
    "Last year, Chairman Mao sent someone to see us, asked us if we were living well, and told us to carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory. Please report to Chairman Mao: Under his leadership, we have healed the wounds of war and our lives have improved.
    "Report to Chairman Mao, we will definitely do as he instructed: carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory. Our branch has already led the masses of the whole village to make a five-year construction plan for the whole village. Five years later, the yield per mu of our entire village's land will be increased from the current 2.25 shi to 5.4 shi. Our agricultural production cooperative will also become a collective farm including all the farmers in the village."
    Jinyun stopped talking. We were both moved by an irresistible emotion. The gentle autumn wind brought the fragrance of the ripening crops. The harvest season is about to begin.

    很大的合作社
    窑上沟有个很大的农业生产合作社。全村二百二十一户农民，已经有一百七十三户参加了合作社。合作社经营着全村百分之七十八——二千五百多亩土地，有十几座砂锅窑，还有七、八百只羊的牧畜业。
    刚到窑上沟时，我还担心这样大的合作社能不能办好？了解情况以后，才感到这种担心是多余的，窑上沟农业生产合作社办的很好。社员们都积极热情地劳动，大家互相关心、互相批评、互相帮助。来到窑上沟的第二天，就有好几个社员要我去看看他们新近落成的蓄水池：“去看看吧，很大很大呢，池底都抹着石灰。”“早先，咱看着老天爷的眼色种地，现在它听咱使唤，给咱浇地。”这真是个大蓄水池，能存四万多担水，使周围三百亩庄稼免除了旱灾的威胁。窑上沟在一架很高的山梁上，它的土地大部在山顶和山坡上，山下虽然有泉有井，可是在山上挖井，挖下十丈八丈还看不见水珠儿。人们吃水全靠旱窖积存下的雨雪。千百年来，人们一直受着旱灾的威胁。早些年，也有人提倡过挖蓄水池，把雨水存起来，在干旱时候浇庄稼。可是，池小了不抵事，挖大池又没有这样大的气力。今年，农业生产合作社发展到一百七十多户，力量大了，从七月下旬开始挖池，完工的第二天正是“八一”建军节，村里人开大会庆祝，都说：要不是共产党领导咱们组织农业生产合作社，解放军保卫咱们的好时光，再别想挖成蓄水池，我们就把它叫“八一蓄水池”吧。大家还写了个信给毛主席，感谢毛主席、共产党给窑上沟村带来的幸福。今年，窑上沟的庄稼长的特别好，农业生产合作社的二千五百多亩土地，每亩平均产量将达到二石四斗，比抗日战争前高一倍多，比去年高百分之四十多。我访问窑上沟时，农业生产合作社已把大田耕作完毕，就等开镰收割了。社员们正集中力量割蒿压肥，翻耕麦地，准备种麦。今年社里共种了七百六十亩秋麦，其中有十五亩半要创造明年的麦田丰产新纪录，达到亩产千斤，另有一百七十八亩要培养成丰产地。九月一日，小麦播种的前几天，王锦云召开了耕作组长会议，检查种麦的准备工作。各组的工作都在顺利地进行着：麦地已翻过两遍到三遍，种子翻晒过三遍以上，拌种消毒用的王铜、赛力散已准备好了，就是肥料还没有达到社的要求——“新纪录”地每亩二百五十担，丰产地一百五十担，都预备好了，就是一般麦田每亩只有七十担，还差二十担。但各组都在用各种可能的方法，努力补足缺少的肥料。韩金木耕作组决定“再卧三夜羊，拆三条炕解决”；史华元组已发动组里的妇女儿童扫垃圾、拾羊粪、再割两天柴熏肥，补足缺少的数量。各组有各组的办法，而且已经开始实行了。九月六日第二次检查时，普通麦田平均每亩已有八十三担肥料，只差七担了。组长们说：“离种麦还有四、五天，保证超过社的施肥计划，绝不能达不到。”
    一天夜里，外面正在落雨，我被吆喊声惊醒了，和我同屋睡的王锦云也醒了。他听了听告诉我：
    “这是叫人们起来，收拾场上晒的大麻子，社里这几天已经收了不少大麻了。”
    “这是谁们叫人起来呢？”
    他侧耳听了听，说：“有栓锁，有海彦—好些人呢，”停了停他补充说：“谁先听见，谁就起来叫吧。”
    社员们已经像关心自己的家庭一样地关心农业生产合作社的一切了。老王又说了很多社员因社忘私的模范行动：就拿刘海彦说吧，他留下的那二亩菜地，长的不好，有草，可是他一天也不耽误社里的集体劳动，他说那二亩地长不好是自家的，社里的地种不好大家吃亏。他决定“明年自己只留下够吃菜的一点儿地，免得分心。”再说史怀旺——那个结婚不久的青年人吧。今年春天，社里号召社员们拿出余粮余钱，暂借给社里买公共耕牛，他一家就拿出四石米，他当时说：“合作社使我生活好了，粮食多吃不清，我多借出点儿。”
    社员们积极热情地参加社的集体劳动，自觉地完成社的生产计划，像关心自己的家庭一样地关心农业生产合作社，这就是窑上沟农业生产合作社办好的一个重要原因。但社员们这样高的思想觉悟是怎样生长起来的呢？
    “主要是党多年来对群众的教育。”王锦云这样说。他的记性真好，从窑上沟支部成立那年一九三八年起，党领导群众进行的各种革命斗争、工作、运动，都记得很清楚，窑上沟支部对农民的思想教育历来就十分重视。一九四三年日寇侵占了离村八里路的蟠龙镇，又在窑上沟村边安上炮楼，支部鼓舞群众的斗争情绪，坚定群众的胜利信心，领导群众创造了“窑洞保卫战”的斗争艺术。他们坚持战斗八个月，配合八路军拔除了村边的敌人据点，驱逐了蟠龙镇的敌人，毙伤日寇八十多名，活捉十多个，成为对敌斗争的模范村。一九四七年支部又领导群众挖穷根、找富根，废除了封建的土地制度，实行了土地改革，使全村农民得到了应该得到的土地。窑上沟支部对于劳动互助的领导，从毛主席发出“组织起来”的号召后，就热烈响应，积极推行。从一九四四年开始组织互助组起，村里的劳动互助运动年年发展，年年提高；去年，支部根据全村已有了七年的劳动互助经验，已有了百分之八十的农户组织起来的情况，在上级党的有力领导之下，成立了以王锦云为首的二十一户农民参加的农业生产合作社。因为党在农民中长期的政治工作和王锦云农业生产合作社的巨大影响，今年便发展为包括百分之七十八的农民，一百七十三户社员的很大的农业生产合作社了。
    “光是群众思想觉悟高，还不能把社办好。”王锦云结束他的谈话时说：“还要有党员的骨干作用和各种制度的保证。”
    关于这方面的情形，几天来我也已经了解了。全村有三十八个党员，个个都是群众的榜样，他们的模范事迹是说不完的，举出这个事实就可见一斑了：从土地改革以来，三十八个党员没有一个雇过长工，没有一个放过高利贷，没有一个出租过土地，没有一个不参加互助组，成立农业生产合作社后，除支部决定的少数党员仍需留在互助组领导尚未入社的群众进行互助生产外，全部都参加了农业生产合作社。
    窑上沟农业生产合作社有许多较好的经验，特别是他们组织劳动的经验。王锦云说：“只要使社员们都能积极劳动，大社也能办好。”他们组织劳动主要有三条经验——在社员自觉的基础上，把多劳多得的按劳取酬原则，和定额管理的包耕制相结合。我到窑上沟那天，正是社里“查田、评工、定产量”开始的一天。这是明年生产的重要准备工作。社的领导干部：社长、生产队长、技术员、总会计等人，组织成“查田评产组”，到每一块地里去仔细评查它明年适宜种什么？能有多少产量？需要用多少工？应该付给土地所有者多少租额？初步决定后交给各个生产队、耕作组讨论，最后在社员大会上通过。“这是件很重要的工作。”郝冬莲—支部委员、妇联主席、合作社的副社长告诉我：“明年我们社的好些工作，全仗这回评的好不好。”
    “查田、评工、定产量”经社员大会通过后，就分配给各个生产队，再分给各个耕作组。各队、组便根据社的耕作要求、产量计划，订出自己的计划。如果社里规定这一块地用二十个工，实际只用了十五个工，又达到了规定的质量标准，秋后分配收获物时，社仍按二十个工付给报酬；社里规定这一块地每亩产量三石，如果实收四石，超过的部分用超额奖励的办法，分给组员一部分。因为在社员觉悟的基础上，实行了耕作责任制，又用定额管理、超额奖励的办法贯彻了按劳取酬的原则，这就大大加强了社员的责任心，提高了社员的劳动情绪。窑上沟村虽然是由距离很远的四个自然村组成的，人们住的很分散，窑上沟农业生产合作社虽然这样大，但这个合作社仍然办得很好。
    “报告毛主席……”
    看到农业生产合作社的成就，了解党对农民的领导和教育后，对于窑上沟村农民普遍富裕的幸福生活，已经没有一点儿的惊奇和疑问。但为了慎重起见，把我在村里了解的情况、材料和对各种事物的印象，最后校正一番，离开窑上沟村的前一天，我同支部书记王锦云同志整整谈了半天。我问他：为什么窑上沟从土地改革以来，没有阶级分化，只有生活上升？为什么旧的思想、风俗和习尚这样迅速地被新思想、新风俗、新习尚所代替了？
    王锦云没有立时回答我。他偏着头沉思着。这是他的习惯，不论作什么工作，解决什么问题，总要用心想一想，考虑成熟后，才着手去作。从一九四七年他担任窑上沟村的支部书记后，村上的各项工作一年比一年进步，支部真正成了领导群众前进的核心，几年来连续被选为全县的模范支部，王锦云也成了群众爱戴和信任的人。从一九五○年他便被选为山西省的模范干部和劳动模范。因为他平常沉寂寡言，深思熟虑，村里人们都亲热地叫他“参谋”。
    “主要是因为组织起来。”王锦云说。
    “可是有的村庄组织起来了，还是有阶级分化呀。”
    “我一下还是说不出个门道，”他说，“我告诉你几件事情吧……”
    前年，村里发生过这样的事情：经过六、七年的劳动互助后，土地产量提高了。一九四八年时，每亩只产九斗五升九合，一九五○年便提高到一石三斗八升，不仅医治了严重的战争创伤，人们的生活还丰裕起来了。许多人就开始买地，那年共有七十四户农民买入了一百七十九亩土地。本村卖地的只有九户——两户作贩卖牲口的投机买卖赔垮了，三户出远门需路费，等等，共卖了二十四亩土地，大部分是从外村买入的。支部觉着这种情形不对，专门召集会议，研究这个问题。王锦云向全体党员说：“我们是要发家致富，可不是要别人变穷，总买外村的地，不是把人家变穷了么？”讨论的结果，党员们都说不再买地了，同时还劝告农民停止买外村的土地。“不买地怎能满足群众发展生产的要求呢？”会议决定引导农民进一步组织起来，提高土地产量，满足群众的要求。第二年春天便以王锦云为首成立起农业生产合作社。第一年，农业生产合作社的产量就提高到每亩一石七斗六升，事实教育农民：要想发展生产，不一定增买土地，组织农业生产合作社就能增加收入，改善生活。这便把群众引导到土地加工、改革技术、组织农业生产合作社的道路上来，避免了因大量购买土地所必然引起的阶级分化，走上了共同发展、普遍富裕的道路。
    人们刚刚开始建设自己的新生活，幸福的大厦还没有最后完工的时候，突然的灾害、病苦，常会使人的生活发生困难。最近四年，村上有李培明、张先元等七人害过较长时间的病，不光不能下地劳动，还化了二百多万元药费。如果不加以帮助，他们七家就会发生困难，甚至出卖土地，变成贫农。在长期的对敌斗争、对封建地主斗争，向自然灾害斗争中，同甘苦共患难的人们，是互相关怀、心心相连的。当支部号召帮助困难户时，大家抢着响应，好几家拿出钱来借给这七户，“甚时有了甚时还，不要利钱”。互助组员们帮助他们耕种，秋后收下粮食后再给工资。在全村人的关怀帮助下，七户长期生病的农民，生活没有遇到很大的困难，也没有下降。
    许多旧的风俗，特别是婚丧大事，人们曾经是很铺张的。结婚要送礼、买嫁装、大张酒筵——美其名叫“喝喜酒”；至于丧葬，就更厉害了，人们会习惯地说：“干了一辈子，舍不得化个钱，死啦可该风光风光。”如果死了父母，还不能排场排场，会被人们说成“不孝”。常常有的人家办一次婚丧大事，破产了。很久以前，窑上沟支部就注意改革这种旧风俗。四年来，村中有十七人病故，六十二个婴儿诞生，但在支部倡导下，很少有请客送礼、大张酒筵、铺张浪费的。事情都在“少化钱办大事”的原则下办好了。史怀旺结婚的事，人们至今还是念念不忘、津津乐道。都说：“新式结婚真好，两人手拉手地到区上办个证明，开个大会就把事办了，又光彩又省钱。”
    王锦云说：“在这方面我们尽量节省，可是在生产建设上，我们从不怕化钱。”他说，土地改革后，窑上沟修盖了一百四十五间新房新窑，增加了三十二头耕牛，五百二十只羊，上千件旧农具和数十件新式犁、喷雾器、轧草机、脱粒机等新式农具。土地投资仅肥料一项，就由原来的四、五十担粮，增加到一百来担，整整增加了一倍。
    窑上沟村一带，是抗日战争时期最巩固的根据地，八路军刚进入华北时，朱总司令和总部就住在离窑上沟八里路的王家峪村。就从那时起，窑上沟的人们开始了自己的新生活。人们知道自己的幸福和人民军队是血肉相连的，人们关切着军属生活，甚于关切自己。从一九四九年起，窑上沟一直是代耕模范村。有个别的村庄，因军属缺乏劳动力，生活变得困难了，但在窑上沟，军属生活不仅不会发生困难，他们的土地比群众产量还高，生活比群众还好。全村四十七户军属，缺乏劳动力享受代耕优待的有十七户，这十七户从没因生活困难出卖过生产资料，还有三户存余粮在十石以上，其余都够吃够用或稍有余剩。那天我去访问军属徐腊梅时，遇见了韩万良耕作组长，他这一组代耕着军属韩栓柱家的八亩半地。他说，为了使军属的土地获得更高的产量，他们自动捐助韩栓柱六十担肥料，并由组员们出钱卧了一夜羊。他们把一亩玉茭培养成了丰产地，能收九百斤；六亩秋田（那二亩本是麦地）今年能收二十石，每亩比群众的平均产量高一石。虽然村里代耕工作是“包耕包产制”，可是组员们把超过的部分完全给军属，自己一点不要。问他为什么，韩万良组长说：“作好代耕工作，也是抗美援朝。”他从衣袋里拿出一个笔记本用他那粗大的手指指着一页让我看。原来上面是他们的爱国公约，其中关于代耕的那一条是：“代耕工作要作好，三耕四锄准作到。上追肥、担水浇，拔除病株保秋苗，军属土地丰产了，就是抗美和援朝。”
    第二天我同王锦云同志一块到县里去——我回北京，他去县参加第九届人民代表大会。最初，我们看着那初秋的阳光照晒着的、正在成熟着的庄稼，谈天说地地闲谈着。可是走过一阵，老王沉寂起来了，我以为他累了，也就不再说话。慢慢地我发觉他在想着一件什么重大的事情，又好像要同我讲什么重要的话，他一会匆匆地走到我的前面去，一会又落在我的后面，几次想说，几次又停止了。
    “有什么事情么？”我问他。
    “我想北京，想毛主席。”他沉思地说：“你说我还能到北京么？能看到毛主席么？”
    我没有想到他会提出这样的问题，一时不知怎么回答他好。可是锦云并没等我回答，又接着说下去了。
    “去年，毛主席派人来看我们，问我们生活过的好不好，嘱咐我们发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣。你回去报告给毛主席：在他的领导下，我们已经医治好战争的创伤，生活好起来了。
    “报告毛主席，我们一定按着他的指示做：发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣。我们支部已经领导全村群众，作出全村的五年建设计划。五年后，我们全村的土地，要由现在的每亩产量二石二斗五升，提高到五石四斗。我们的农业生产合作社，也将变成包括全村农民的集体农庄。”
    锦云不说话了。我们俩都为一种不可抗拒的情绪激动着。柔和的秋风，送来了庄稼成熟的芳香。收获的季节就要开始了。
