    Peasant Revolutionary Hero Song Jingshi and His Black Flag Army
    —Summary of "Historical Investigation Report on Song Jingshi"
    Chen Baichen
    Editor's Note: After the publication of "A Historical Investigation of Wu Xun," the broad masses of readers have continuously written letters requesting the introduction of the history of the peasant revolutionary movement in the late Qing Dynasty; they have also developed infinite love for Song Jingshi, one of the heroic peasant revolutionary leaders. In order to meet the needs of the masses, playwrights Chen Baichen, A Jia, Jia Ji, and others organized a scriptwriting team and went to the peasant revolutionary areas at that time to conduct investigations. This investigation not only allowed the long-buried historical traces of a vigorous peasant revolution to reappear, clearing away the slanders and insults imposed on the people by the past ruling class, but also provided a commendable method for studying the history of the past century. This newspaper publishes the summary of this investigation report for general readers and comrades in cultural circles to refer to. Tian Han and Chen Baichen are also writing a Peking opera script based on this material; a film about Song Jingshi is also in production.
    I. Foreword
    In September 1951, we established the "Song Jingshi Writing Team." The task of this team was designated as: after studying the written materials about Song Jingshi, to go to the Tangyi area of the original Shandong Province to conduct historical investigations of Song Jingshi, and to use the historical materials provided by the peasant masses to create film and stage scripts that praise the peasant revolutionary hero Song Jingshi. From September to mid-November last year, we collected the written materials scattered everywhere at that time, sorted them out, and compiled them into reference materials of about 70,000 words. At the same time, we held many symposiums, studied and solved several historical problems, and made the necessary preparations for fieldwork. In mid-March 1952, the writing team set out for the investigation. The participants included: A Jia, Jia Ji, Weng Ouhong, Jing Gu Xue, Wu Nanqing, Qi Zhaoliang, Wu Qing, Zheng Baitao, Chen Baichen, and others. We returned to Beijing on May 15. Except for travel delays and preparation and rest, the actual working time was forty-seven days. We spent more than one-third of our time in Gangtun
    (Song Jingshi's hometown and revolutionary base) and Liulin (the most stubborn stronghold of the counter-revolutionary landlord armed forces) and the surrounding investigation. Then, divided into two groups, around the gang Tun and Willow Lin for the periphery of seven counties investigation. Finally, the two groups merged and went to Heze area to investigate the great battle in which the Taiping Army and Nian Army joint forces annihilated Seng Gelinqin's army. A total of eight counties and 163 villages in Tangyi, Guanxian, Xinxian, Liaocheng, Qingping, Heze in present-day Pingyuan Province and Linqing and Guantao in present-day Hebei Province were investigated, and 719 old people were interviewed, recording approximately 180,000 words of original interview material. After the whole group returned to Beijing, two months were spent classifying, sorting, and initially analyzing the interview records. At the same time, the Chinese Opera Research Institute's data room also collected a large number of direct and indirect written materials related to Song Jingshi, totaling more than 500,000 words. The "Historical Investigation Report on Song Jingshi" is now being written, based primarily on peasant interview records, combined with, referencing, and comparing written materials. Now, the summary of this report is published first.
    Since the publication of "A Historical Investigation of Wu Xun," general readers have developed a feeling of infinite love for the peasant revolutionary hero Song Jingshi, hoping to learn more about his heroic deeds. Many people have also proposed to express this heroic figure in literary and artistic forms—movies, stage plays, novels, paintings, etc. At the same time, some readers have raised several questions about the history of Song Jingshi, hoping to obtain answers. In order to meet the eager expectations of readers, we have an obligation to report to readers first the history of the heroic Song Jingshi obtained from the investigation in brief.
    The main gain of our investigation work is first reflected in the evaluation of the historical figure of Song Jingshi. Before departure, including some comrades in our team, several people had a skeptical attitude towards the revolutionary hero Song Jingshi. Because according to the official records of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, he had once "surrendered" to the enemy and even "rebelled" against the revolution. However, the results of the investigation, in the word of mouth of the broad masses of people, corrected and washed away all the slanders and insults that the "official books" gave to Song Jingshi. He not only did not really surrender to the enemy, nor did he betray the people, but continued to work for the revolution until he was seventy-seven years old. Secondly, some people also had a skeptical attitude towards conducting historical investigations among the peasant masses, especially the historical investigation of such a peasant uprising. The results of the investigation successfully proved that the history that exists among the people is a real, rich, and vivid history. The authenticity of the materials they provided overturned many fabrications of "official" books, such as the issue of Song Jingshi's "surrender"; corrected many errors in "official" books, such as the record of Song Jingshi's arrest and execution in the tenth year of Tongzhi; and more importantly, supplemented the parts concealed and missing in the "official" books, such as the reasons for the uprising of the peasants in western Shandong and the Black Flag Army, such as the internal situation of the landlord group and its various types, such as the corruption and incompetence of the reactionary army, such as the objective reasons for the compromise between Song Jingshi's Black Flag Army and the Manchu Qing army, etc. With these supplements, some dead "official" books become living history. The richness of the materials provided by the peasants made it possible to comprehensively explain several individual and isolated events, to give typical significance to many similar events, and to unify many contradictory events. The vividness of the materials provided by the peasants enabled several problems to be specifically proven and answered, and enhanced their authenticity. Based on these experiences, we have gained this understanding: conducting investigations among the people in the study of the history of the past century is not only possible, but also necessary. Without the correction and supplementation of mass materials, the conclusion of purely written material research may be erroneous, or at least not comprehensive enough. Finally, the reason why our investigation work was successful was that we relied on the basic masses in the investigation. Generally speaking, poor and lower-middle peasants in rural areas lack culture, but in the 180,000 words of recorded material we collected, from the most essential and valuable materials to the details of life, more than 95% were provided by them. What landlords, rich peasants, and urban intellectuals can give us are only some empty, frivolous, and even nonsense things. Even those who had participated in the compilation of the county chronicles of this county were dumbfounded and unable to answer this great revolutionary movement. And the poor and lower-middle peasants not only possess these materials but are also loyal protectors of these materials. They do not fabricate, embellish, exaggerate, or speak presumptuously. The conversation must be based on something, and most of them still retain the original content they heard, even the original sentences, grammar, and tone. —And these are also the main experiences and lessons in our investigation work. We think it is also necessary to briefly introduce it to the readers first.
    The following is an outline of the great uprising of peasants in western Shandong at that time and the history of Song Jingshi's Black Flag Army. It is a summary compressed from nearly 200,000 words of reports. Many materials, especially the many vivid examples listed by the peasants and their simple and beautiful language, could not be quoted, which is a great regret. This can only ask the readers to forgive.
    II. Peasant Revolutionary Leader Song Jingshi and the Western Shandong
    Peasant Uprising
    Song Jingshi was born in 1824 in Xiaoliuguanzhuang (i.e., Xiaoliguanzhuang) near Gangtun (i.e., Ganguantun, or Gangtun or Gangjiatun), fifty miles northwest of Dongchang Prefecture (now Liaocheng Prefecture, Pingyuan Province), Shandong Province (three miles southeast). This year (1952) is one hundred and twenty-nine years old. According to the peasants, his family has been poor peasants for generations. Song Jingshi's parents were alive, and he had three brothers, two sisters, and one younger sister. A family of ten or so people had only a dozen acres of land, which was not enough to eat. Although he had read for one or two years when he was young, he was carrying small jobs in the nearby villages when he was ten years old. Then he experienced many side businesses that poor peasants usually experience. In addition to farming and watering vegetable gardens, he pushed carts, sold dried tofu, tofu shreds, ironed, burned kilns, sold oil vinegar, made cotton seeds, trafficked horses, sold wax, worked as a hired worker, served as a soldier, served as a horse team, ... and also trafficked smuggled salt. Like ordinary peasants in western Shandong, he loved martial arts since he was a child. But because he was poor, he had no money to learn from a teacher, so he learned secretly. Later, in order to fail in kicking the field outside, the people in the village were afraid of losing face, so they allowed him to participate in the martial arts field in the village and worshiped the third master Liu Houyi as his teacher. (This Liu Houyi later became one of the generals of the Black Flag Army.) But Song Jingshi had many teachers later, and the one who had a great influence on him was Sun Rujing in Xiwang Village. It is said that Song Jingshi was dressed very neatly on the day he worshiped Sun Rujing as his teacher. Sun Rujing saw him and asked his wife to find a dung basket. Song said, "I'll go." Sun Rujing said, "You are so clean, you can't do this." Song Jingshi took off his clothes, rolled up his trouser legs, jumped into the dung pond and picked up dung. Sun Rujing then accepted him as a disciple.
    In 1854, the fourth year of Xianfeng in the Qing Dynasty, the second batch of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's Northern Expeditionary Army captured Guanxian, Xinxian, and Linqing, and stationed troops twice in Qingshui Town, Guanxian, twelve miles away from Gangtun. Song Jingshi and many peasants went to welcome the Taiping Army. Sun Rujing also joined the army with more than a dozen other disciples at this time. After the retreat from Linqing, Sun Rujing stayed in Xiaoliuguanzhuang, where Song Jingshi lived, for several days. Then he went south with the Taiping Army. Before leaving, many disciples solemnly kowtowed to their master to bid farewell, and regarded the large knife he left behind as a precious object, and warned each other not to move it. Song Jingshi undoubtedly initially accepted revolutionary ideas from Sun Rujing. At this time, he had learned all his martial arts, and began two new occupations: performing martial arts and protecting the family. —This is the open occupation that Song Jingshi could take to make a living, make friends with heroes, and look for revolutionary leaders. Wang Tao's "Weng You Yu Tan" affirmed the revolutionary purpose of this occupation. He said that he took this opportunity to persuade people to "rebel."
    In 1860, the tenth year of Xianfeng, anti-grain movements were generally launched in all provinces of Shandong except Dengzhou "the remaining nine prefectures and two directly subordinate prefectures". The peasants said that there had been continuous disasters at that time, and everyone was "eating chaff and swallowing vegetables" and "couldn't live". Prices were high, land prices were low, carrying labor was not worth money, and landlords exploited poor peasants with high interest rates and bought land at low prices. Silver prices rose, and land taxes were calculated in silver; the tribute grain was subjected to layer-by-layer exploitation by corrupt officials and officials, especially the poor peasants who could not pay the whole bucket, encountered a yamen official called "digging liters", "paying three buckets is not enough for him to dig three liters." The yamen servant who urged grain payment was called
    "umbrella", "entering the door to eat first, and taking money when leaving. —If you don't give, you will be arrested, and the tribute grain must be paid as usual." Under various kinds of exploitation and oppression, the peasants in Tangyi, Guanxian, Xinxian, Guantao and other counties broke out in anti-grain movements due to the problem of big grain and small grain. The so-called big and small grain is a grade system based on the fertility and barrenness of the land, stipulating the amount of grain to be paid, but the landlords wanted to transfer the burden to the poor peasants on the additional militia fees and donations, and they came up with the idea of abolishing this grade and distributing the big and small grain equally. —In fact, because the amount of donations and taxes is fixed, this is equivalent to "making the small grain into big grain, and the big grain into small grain." The county officials colluded with the landlords, and the poor peasants who resisted payment were imprisoned, "and they couldn't win the lawsuit against the landlords." At this time, Song Jingshi stood up to lead the peasants' anti-grain movement.
    Song Jingshi was originally a gentle, unhurried, good-tempered, and taciturn person. People called him "Song Yatou" and "Song Niu'er." But when he heard people on the street talking about the big and small grain, he said:
    "This is too unfair, everyone don't pay!" Song Jingshi led men, women, old and young, carrying wooden shovels, hoes, plows, rakes... to the county government, saying, "The land should not be planted, and planting the land is not enough to pay the grain!" The county official had no way, and temporarily agreed to the peasants' exemption, and allowed
    "erecting a stele as a record." But afterwards, he immediately sent someone to arrest Song Jingshi. The peasants said: "Song ran away and rebelled." But some said: Song was arrested and imprisoned, and his friends robbed the prison and rescued him before he rebelled.
    But the generally rumored "robbery of the prison" was in Guanxian, and Song Jingshi went to rescue people, not to be rescued. Song Jingshi's imprisonment may have been earlier, or he was released not long after his imprisonment. Because the peasants who resisted grain were "in groups of three or five" together, "scattered openly and gathered secretly", gradually gathered in Hancun, Zhaozhuang near Qingshui Town and Baita Market in Guanxian, and Yanzhuang near Guantao; from October in the winter of the tenth year of Xianfeng to February of the eleventh year, the peasants gathered more than 10,000 people, "resisting officials and making trouble in Cao", erecting the banner of righteousness. And the peasants said that this was all led by Song Jingshi.
    February 19 is the birthday of Guanyin, which is circulated among the people, and there are temple fairs everywhere. Song Jingshi took the opportunity to invite many heroes—some of them were leaders of the White Lotus Sect in western Shandong—to rob the prison in Guanxian. Many people went, but only eighteen people were left to Guanxian City. These eighteen people disguised themselves as firewood sellers and street performers to get into the city. In the middle of the night, they set a fire in the city, shouting: "Rebellion! Rebellion!" The responders outside the city ran around with rattles hanging around their necks—as if there were many troops and horses. Some climbed the wall and entered the city. There were not many officers and soldiers in the city, and they all fled the city upon hearing the alarm. Everyone opened the prison, rescued many figures needed for the revolution, and rebelled from Guanxian. This was the signal for the great uprising of peasants in western Shandong, and the peasant revolutionary army attacked various prefectures and counties from then on.
    The masses led by Song Jingshi were mainly peasants who participated in the anti-grain movement. But six out of ten of the peasants who carried out armed uprisings were believers in the White Lotus Sect. —This means that the great uprising of peasants in western Shandong was jointly led by Song Jingshi and the White Lotus Sect. This has been the case since the robbery of the prison or the anti-grain movement.
    Song Jingshi himself was not a member of the White Lotus Sect, as evidenced by various materials. But he had a deep friendship with many leaders of the White Lotus Sect, especially with common revolutionary demands, so they united very well.
    The White Lotus Sect in western Shandong was not a unified whole either, mainly divided into two systems: Xinxian and Qiuxian. The leader of the White Lotus Sect in Xinxian was Cong Jia of Yanjia Village. Cong Jia's Cong Zheng was an old traitor. He led the White Lotus Sect uprising in the Daoguang years and failed. He was exiled to Xinjiang. Later, he betrayed the revolution and was pardoned and returned; therefore, there was a contradiction between him and his son Cong Shiqin, who advocated "rebellion." Cong Jia's leadership in the church seems to have been transferred to Yang Tai of Qili Hancun in Guanxian as a result. Guanxian and Tangyi Gangtun are adjacent to each other, and Song Jingshi has also protected the courtyard near Hancun, so the one who cooperated with Song Jingshi from the anti-grain to the robbery of the prison was Yang Tai, who represented the White Lotus Sect system in Xinxian. Before the prison robbery, Yang Tai established a military organization led by himself—the so-called Five Great Flags: Yang Tai and his son Yang Pengling, etc., established the green flags, Zhang Yuhuai, etc., the yellow flags, Cheng Shunshu, etc., the white flags, Jin San, Gao Si, etc., the red flags; the black flag was a special figure—led by the non-believer Song Jingshi. And the White Lotus Sect of the Qiuxian system was led by Zhang Shanji of Houjia Village (near Qiuxian) in Linqing, and he also established the Five Great Flags under his leadership. But there was also a special exception, and the black flag among his five great flags was also led by the non-believer Song Jingshi. The five great flags of the two systems in Xinxian and Qiuxian relied heavily on Song Jingshi, and Song Jingshi's Black Flag Army also accepted the leadership and command of both sides. And between Xinxian and Qiuxian, because Yang Tai was Zhang Shanji's disciple, Zhang Shanji became the nominal chief leader—the leader—of the two major systems.
    With the signal of the prison robbery in Guanxian, the five great flags of the two major systems in Xinxian and Qiuxian, including Song Jingshi's Black Flag Army, under unified leadership, took Guanxian as the center and marched militarily into various counties. Zhang Yuhuai was from Daliwang Village in Xinxian, so he led his army to capture Xinxian, continued to capture Chaocheng and Guancheng, and marched into Qingfeng, Zhili. Yang Pengling captured Guantao, crossed the Wei River, and joined forces with Zhang Shanji's troops. And Sun Quanren, under Zhang Shanji's command, had already invaded Qiuxian. Song Jingshi and other leaders first occupied Shazhen, the southwestern important town of Dongchang Prefecture. From this, Lei Fengming and other troops attacked and captured Tangyi County to the north; Gao Si and other troops attacked and captured Yanggu to the south, occupied Zhangqiu, Qiji, Acheng and other towns along the canal, and besieged Shouzhang; and Song Jingshi himself took on the most difficult task of siege—besieging Dongchang. While besieging Dongchang, Yang Tai and Zhang Shanji jointly marched, successively capturing Fanxian, Puzhou, Quzhou, Qinghe, Guangping and other county towns, and besieging Daming and Weixian, marching into Linqing and Wucheng. The siege of Dongchang lasted for more than two months. Although it was not captured, the peasant uprising army had already occupied the main commercial area of Dongguan Old Rice Market Street and the temple area. And twice crossed the canal, attacking the border of Qingping and Boping counties. More importantly, a major battle was fought with the Qing army of Mingxin, Urgong Zhabu, Qin Jilong and others in Shazhen. Ming and Qin were both killed and fell from their horses, and the soldiers were defeated and suffered heavy casualties; Urgong Zhabu and Mingxin both fled to Chiping as a result, and Qin Jilong closed the city and defended it, daring not to fight. It was because Song Jingshi blocked, contained and eliminated the enemy's main force in Dongchang that other peasant revolutionary armies successfully captured thirteen county towns in a row, attacked more than twenty counties, achieved brilliant victories, and expanded their troops to 50,000 to 100,000 people.
    The great victory and growth of the peasant uprising army was due to the fact that they conformed to and represented the revolutionary demands of the peasants. On the basis of the "anti-grain" movement, they put forward the slogans of "reviving the Han and destroying the Hu" and "sweeping away the Qing and establishing the Ming" politically, sang the ballad "Little Tartars are shameless, who will protect you for two hundred autumns?" and posted the notice "Suffering for two hundred years, let's also avenge our grievances." Economically, they called for "acting on behalf of heaven" and "robbing the rich and helping the poor." They opened the granaries of landlords and wealthy gentry everywhere and distributed grain publicly; and distributed the money, wealth and clothing of large households to the poor. After capturing the county town, it was "releasing prisoners, burning warehouses, destroying military camps and government offices," so "poor people carried millet out of the city, which was crowded on the road." The peasants said that the uprising army was "praised by the poor households and hated by the good households." Therefore, "those who followed the rebellion were like returning home." After the uprising, Song Jingshi's troops are said to have rushed to all the eight major markets. "One hundred people went in, and two hundred people came out"; "dozens of people in one market, and hundreds of people in the next", especially young peasants, were more enthusiastic about joining the army, and many children in their teens joined. There was a Wang Yuzhu, from Zhang Village, Guanxian. "One day, he met the Black Flag while carrying a load. Someone called out to him: 'Come to us!' He dropped his load and joined without going home." In the 102 villages we investigated in Tangyi County, except for Baiguantun, a village with a plaque lying on the ground, using the four words "righteous person" to prove that it was the only one without anyone participating in the "rebellion", any other village "cannot do without the Black Flag". (Peasants often use the Black Flag to represent the entire uprising army.) And only two families in Chouchong Zhang Village did not participate in the uprising. Only one and a half "good people" in Xiazhuang: —Chen Ban's family, Zheng Good Man. Because only one of the Chen family's two brothers participated. Baita Market is a large market with thousands of households, and "only three families don't eat 'rebel' rice." And it goes without saying about the Gangtun area, which is all "the same color." Even in Liulin and Fanzhai, the strongholds of landlord armed forces, the peasants can name the names of the people who participated in the Black Flag. Therefore, the peasants at that time excitedly said: "I only heard about the rebellion, but I didn't know what it was. When I came out to take a look, good! What kind of rebellion is it? They are all fellow villagers! —All are people from our village!"
    Among the armies of various flags, Song Jingshi's Black Flag Army was particularly strong and powerful due to its strict discipline, good relations between the army and the people, and especially its strong combat effectiveness. In addition to the general anti-grain peasants, most of the peasants in the "chaos" struggle in Tangyi and Guanxian and the "private salt dealers" also participated in the Black Flag. "Chaos" is a struggle between poor peasants who pick up the remaining cotton in the landlord's cotton fields and the thugs hired by the landlord, and many figures who led this struggle, such as Yang Er Ma and Xia Sangu, led the peasants to participate in the uprising. Song Jingshi himself had trafficked in private salt and had been in prison with them, so thousands of them participated in the uprising army. In addition, Zhang Luji in Chaocheng—nine out of ten of the three thousand households in the entire market were Hui people—the Hui people, under the leadership of the Hui landlord Ma Qishan, organized the West Region Hui Brigade and also participated in the uprising. But because it did not conform to the teachings of the White Lotus Sect, they joined the Black Flag Army. Therefore, it is possible that most of the non-believing masses were led by the Black Flag.
    III. Victory, Compromise and Re-Uprising of the Peasant Uprising Army
    The uprising army captured thirteen cities in a row, occupying a large plain area in western Shandong and the border area of Zhili, and had broken into the so-called important area of Jifu. Yang Tai and Zhang Shanji also became emperors. The Manchu Qing court was greatly shocked and transferred troops and generals to Shandong. In addition to the Mingxin infantry sent by Shandong Governor Qing Sheng in February and the cavalry of Urgong Zhabu sent by Seng Gelinqin being defeated in Dongchang by the Black Flag Army with heavy casualties; the newly appointed Governor Tan Tingxiang also brought Bausch's troops to Jinan in Dongchang in late April. This is the east route. In April and May, Shengbao was sent to supervise the military affairs of Zhili Shandong, attacking Qiuxian, Guanxian, and Puzhou from Weixian and Linqing in three routes. This is the west route. The south route was called Seng Gelinqin, relying on the danger of the Yellow River to block the road to cross the river and join forces with the Nian Army. In mid-May, Seng Gelinqin also sent Mongolian Dutong Xiling'a and Deputy Chief Manager Hengling to lead cavalry to station troops in Dongchang in preparation for the north route. He wanted to use overwhelming military strength to suppress the uprising army.
    From mid-April, Shengbao crossed the Wei River from Weixian to the southeast; from mid-May, Xiling'a and Hengling attacked southwest from Dongchang. By June 19, the two armies seemed to be invincible, successively capturing Qiuxian, Guanxian, Guantao, Tangyi, Xinxian, Chaocheng, Guancheng, and other important strongholds such as Xiabaosi, Jianzhong, Sanga, Baita, Futou, Gangtun, Qilihancun, Daliwangzhuang, and Shazhen. According to the peasants, the actual situation was "Shengbao suffered seven defeats in a row". —The uprising army exchanged several empty cities for the glorious victory of annihilating Shengbao's army seven times. The result was that Shengbao "retreated to the north of the Wei River" to Weixian after capturing the empty city, and the uprising army "chased out more than a hundred miles", and the entire war situation changed. The original strength of the uprising army was not weakened at all, and they appeared one after another in many strongholds between several county towns. Especially in the vast area between Tangyi, Guanxian, Linqing, Xinxian, and Chaocheng, from Zhangba and Dachang in Xin and Chao in the south, through Sanga, Jiazhen, and Gangtun in Tang and Guan in the middle, to Yangfen in Guantao in the north, all were "spreading" and "full" of the uprising army. And three branches of troops protruded from between Xinxian, Chaocheng, and Guancheng, counterattacking Quzhou, Qiuxian, Guantao, Linqing, and Qinghe north of the Wei River, reaching Shengbao's rear. Shengbao had no choice but to retreat to Weixian to defend the important northern Jifu area.
    At this time, a new situation appeared. Shengbao's army suffered severe losses, only in exchange for several empty cities under siege. He could no longer fight. The uprising army also encountered a serious crisis. The peasants said: "After the farmers won the battle, they thought that the officers and soldiers would not dare to come again, and they all wanted to go home to farm. —As a result, people dispersed!" And they explained: "Farmers feel uncomfortable if they don't see the crops for three days!" Song Jingshi's Black Flag Army was also "slowly decreasing, unable to hold on" at this time. This is one. On June 5, Yang Tai was unfortunately killed in battle during the retreat from Xinxian. On June 17, Zhang Shanji attacked back to Zhili from Chaocheng and was captured and sacrificed in Shahe County. Two major leaders were lost in half a month. This is two. This may have caused chaos and contradictions within the uprising army. The peasants said: "Several marshals of the Five Great Flags had family affairs, and Song Jingshi couldn't hold on, and the other flags would all 'collapse'." And Song Jingshi "wrote documents to transfer other flags, but the other flags did not go north." This is three. The uprising army, which existed in these three major crises, and Shengbao had the possibility of a temporary compromise.
    Shengbao was originally a person who was good at "appeasement". The Nian Army was besieging Seng Gelinqin in five routes south of the Yellow River, and the Manchu Qing government also hoped to draw Shengbao's strength to attack the Nian Army. Therefore, Shengbao took the initiative to start the "appeasement"—compromise plan. He first attacked Song Jingshi. This was his plan to "catch the thief and catch the king". He knew that Song Jingshi was a figure "relied on heavily" by the uprising army, and that he was a figure with contradictions and weaknesses.
    Shengbao used three figures to attack Song Jingshi: The first was the old traitor Cong Zheng. He used the leader position of the White Lotus Sect to persuade him to surrender, using and exaggerating the internal contradictions of the White Lotus Sect and the contradictions with Song Jingshi to disintegrate the unity between the leaders. The second was Ma Qishan of Zhangluji. Shengbao first incorporated his West Region Hui Brigade into the people's regiment. This is equivalent to saying that Ma Qishan had already surrendered to Shengbao, using the armed rebellion of the West Region Hui Brigade to threaten Song Jingshi, and then persuading him to surrender in the same way. The third was Song Jingshi's "benefactor" Wang Bailing, also known as Wang Erxiang. This was a bully, litigator and landlord who could "bring the dead to life" with his flowery words. Relying on having "favored" Song Jingshi, he represented Shengbao and also the interests of the landlords, talking to Song Jingshi in all directions, "reconciling both sides", and "guaranteeing both sides", inducing Song Jingshi to surrender.
    "A Brief Record of Shandong Military Affairs" said that Song Jingshi asked Cheng Lu, a subordinate of Shengbao, to surrender around June 13, and that Shengbao immediately went to the front line of Yandian in Xin County to accept the surrender. This is a ridiculous statement to embellish the facade. Because the same book said that on June 22, Cheng Lu sent Gosh Zhao Yulin and others to Song's camp to issue merit plaques, flags, and military fire, ordering them to wait for inspection in five days, and "Yulin and others were almost killed". The compromise negotiation was not established at all. "A Brief Record" also said that on June 17 and 19, Song Jingshi attacked Chaocheng and Guancheng for the Manchu Qing army. This is also a self-defeating rumor, because the Xin County Chronicle said that "on July 16, the rebel Song Jingshi" was still "recapturing the city". —But the negotiation was finally established, but after Wang Bailing's flowery words and "guaranteeing both sides", this negotiation on an equal footing was degraded into a one-sided "appeasement" after the fact—the so-called "surrender". The peasants had this to say about this matter: "Song Ershuai (Jingli) said: Wang Erxiang sold his brother." Song Jingshi was deceived and sold out in the encirclement of landlords, politicians, bureaucrats, and traitors.
    What were the specific conditions of the negotiation at that time, how Wang Bailing and others specifically deceived Song Jingshi, and how Song Jingshi subjectively coped with this scam at that time, etc., are all impossible to investigate. But seeing the struggle of Song Jingshi and others after crossing the Yellow River, it can be confirmed that this compromise was deceived and sold out.
    The negotiation between Song Jingshi and Shengbao was officially agreed upon around the end of July. By November 25, most of the generals of the peasant uprising army, including Zhang Yuhuai, Yang Pengling, the son of Yang Tai, Cheng Shunshu, Lei Fengming, Cong Shiqin, Ma Rong, etc., had reached an agreement with Shengbao. In the three months between early August and November, there may have been a new arrangement and adjustment within the White Lotus Sect uprising army, that is, a five-flag group was re-established with Cong Jia of Yanjia Village as the head; Cong Shiqin also put on a yellow robe and forced Cong Zheng to succeed Zhang Shanji and Yang Tai as emperor, and as a result, Cong Zheng died of anger. After several battles with Shengbao, a comprehensive compromise was reached. And Song Jingshi still maintained a certain friendship and tacit understanding with the White Lotus Sect during this period. The "official" book recognized that the White Lotus Sect army deliberately "spread rumors of hating Jingshi" and "publicly made it difficult for Jingshi". And when Shengbao attacked Yanjia Village and sent Song Jingshi to attack the south gate and west gate
    "Song Jingshi shouted loudly with a large knife without killing anyone, and let go of many people." Even today, the peasants in Yanjia Village are still talking about this matter with gratitude. This shows that Song Jingshi did not betray his friendly army or the people after compromising with Shengbao.
    Song Jingshi's Black Flag Army and other flags did not betray the people, mainly from the following many actions, especially the struggle to cross the Yellow River.
    When the overall compromise was reached at the end of November of the eleventh year of Xianfeng, the Black Flag and other flags were nominally "temporarily stationed in Guantao, Linqing, and Daming" and waited for "accompanying the expedition". In fact, the fighters were all scattered home, "unwilling to go south". Shengbao and Tan Tingxiang asked Yang Shaohe, a great gentry in Liaocheng, and the heads of the militia groups of various counties to go to Tangyi, Guanxian, and Xinxian to "check and drive out from village to village, ordering them to return to the camp". This proves that the uprising army had either not admitted at all in the negotiations with Shengbao that they would help the reactionary ruling class to "suppress" the Nian; or had been tricked into agreeing, and used this method of scattering home to deal with it. This method was quite successful. The uprising army originally had 50,000 to 100,000 people, but only barely mustered seven camps—more than 3,000 people—when crossing the river for the last time, and it was delayed until the middle of the first month of the first year of Tongzhi before arriving at the Yellow River.
    The uprising army used various methods to resist "accompanying the expedition" across the river. Before crossing the river, Zhang Yuhuai and Yang Pengling "privately raised dead parties", and Song Jingshi even "secretly sent (three) younger brothers (Song

    农民革命英雄宋景诗及其黑旗军
    ——“宋景诗历史调查报告”提要
    陈白尘
    编者按：“武训历史调查记”发表后，广大读者群众不断来信要求介绍清末农民革命运动的历史；对英勇的农民革命领袖之一的宋景诗，更产生了无限热爱。为了满足群众的要求，剧作家陈白尘、阿甲、贾霁等组织了剧本创作组，并出发到当时农民革命地区进行调查。这个调查不但使久经湮没的一场轰轰烈烈的农民革命史迹，得以重见天日，廓清了过去统治阶级所强加于人民的诬蔑与污辱，而且提供了一种值得提倡的研究近百年史的重要方法。本报把这一调查报告提要发表出来，供一般读者和文化界的同志们参阅。田汉、陈白尘并根据此项材料编写京剧剧本；关于宋景诗的影片亦在制作中。
    一、前言
    一九五一年九月，我们成立了“宋景诗创作组”。这个组的任务被指定为：在研究了有关宋景诗的文字材料以后，前往原山东省堂邑一带进行宋景诗的历史调查，以农民群众所提供的历史材料，来创作表扬农民革命英雄宋景诗的电影及舞台剧本。去年九月至十一月半，搜集了当时所可能找到的、散见各处的文字材料加以整理排比，编成约七万字的参考资料。同时举行许多座谈会，研究并解决了若干历史问题。为实地调查工作做了必要的准备。一九五二年三月半，创作组出发调查，参加调查的有：阿甲、贾霁、翁偶虹、景孤血、吴南青、祁兆良、吴青、郑白涛、陈白尘等九人。五月十五日返京，除了旅途耽搁及准备与休息外，实际工作四十七天。我们以三分之一以上的时间放在岗屯
    （宋景诗的家乡与革命根据地）与柳林（反革命地主武装的最顽固堡垒）两大集镇及其周围的调查上。然后分成两个小组，围绕着岗屯与柳林进行外围七个县的调查。最后两组合并，同到菏泽地区，调查宋景诗所参加的太平军及捻军联合部队歼灭僧格林沁大军的一次伟大战役。总计调查了今平原省的堂邑、冠县、莘县、聊城、清平、菏泽及今河北省的临清、馆陶八个县、一百六十三个村庄，访问七百一十九位老人，记录原始谈话材料约十八万字。全组回京后，以两个月的时间，对谈话记录进行了分类整理与初步分析工作。同时，中国戏曲研究院资料室，又大量搜集了五十万字以上的有关宋景诗的直接、间接文字材料。现在正以农民谈话记录为主，结合、参考、对比着文字材料编写“宋景诗历史调查报告”。现在先把这个报告提要发表出来。
    自从“武训历史调查记”发表以后，一般读者对于农民革命英雄宋景诗发生了无限热爱的心情，希望更多地了解到关于他的英雄事迹。很多人并提出以文艺形式—电影、舞台剧、小说、绘画等来表现这个英雄人物的要求。同时也有一些读者对于宋景诗的历史提出若干疑问，希望获得解答。为了满足读者们殷切的期望，我们有把调查所得的英雄宋景诗的历史先扼要地报告给读者们的义务。
    我们这次调查工作的主要收获，首先是表现在对于宋景诗这一历史人物的估价问题上。出发之前，包括我们组的一部分同志在内，若干人对于革命英雄宋景诗是存在着怀疑态度的。因为根据满清官方记载，他是曾向敌人一度“投降”过，甚至“叛变”过革命的。但调查结果，在广大人民群众口碑中，纠正了、洗刷了“官书”所给予宋景诗的一切诬蔑与侮辱。他不仅没有真的投降过敌人，也没有叛变过人民，而且一直到他七十七岁的时候还在为革命奔走。其次，对于在农民群众中进行历史调查，特别是这样一次农民起义的历史调查，若干人同样也抱着怀疑态度。而调查结果胜利地证明了：在人民群众中所存在的历史是真实的、丰富的、生动的历史。他们所提供的材料的真实性，推翻了许多“官”书的伪造，如宋景诗的“投降”问题；纠正了“官”书许多错误，如宋景诗在同治十年被捕杀的记载；更重要的则是补充了“官”书当中所掩饰、缺少的部分，如鲁西农民和黑旗军起义原因，如地主集团内部情况及其诸种类型，如反动军队的腐朽无能，如宋景诗黑旗军与满清军队妥协的客观原因等等。有了这些补充才使一些死的“官”书成为活的历史。农民所提供材料的丰富性，使得若干个别的、孤立的事件获得全面性的说明，使得许多类似的事件获得典型的意义，使得许多矛盾的事件获得统一。农民所提供材料的生动性，使得若干问题获得具体的证明与解答，并增强其真实的程度。而根据这些经验使我们获得这样的认识：近百年史的研究在人民群众中进行调查不仅是可能，而且是必要的。如果没有群众材料的纠正与补充，单纯文字材料的研究，其结论将可能是有错误的，起码也将是不够全面的。最后，我们的调查工作之所以成功，则是我们在调查中依靠了基本群众。农村中贫雇农和中农一般说是缺少文化的，但我们所搜集的十八万字记录材料中，从最本质、最有价值的材料一直到生活细节的材料，百分之九十五以上是他们所供给的。而地主、富农、城市知识分子所能给予我们的只有一些空洞的、虚浮的甚至是胡说白道的东西。连那曾经参加过本县县志修纂的人，对于这一伟大的革命运动也都是瞠目结舌，无辞以对。而贫雇农不仅拥有这些材料而且是这些材料的忠实的保护人。他们不臆造、不粉饰、不夸张、也不想当然地乱说。谈话必有所本，而大半都还保持他所听来的原有的内容，甚至是原有的语句、语法和语气。——而这些也就是我们这次调查工作中的主要经验教训。我们以为也是有把它先扼要地介绍给读者们的必要的。
    下面便是当时鲁西农民大起义以及宋景诗黑旗军历史的一个轮廓。它是从将近二十万字的报告中压缩出来的提要，有许多材料，特别是农民们所列举的许多生动的例证及其朴实而美丽的语言都没能加以引用，是很大的遗憾。这只有请求读者们加以原谅了。
    二、农民革命领袖宋景诗和鲁西
    农民大起义
    宋景诗在一八二四年生于原山东省东昌府（今平原省聊城专区）堂邑县西北五十里岗屯（即甘官屯，亦即冈屯或冈家屯）附近（东南三里）小刘贯庄。（即小李官庄）今年（一九五二）是一百二十九岁。据农民说，他家几代以来，都是贫农。宋景诗父母双全，弟兄三人，二姊一妹，一家十来口仅有十几亩地，不够吃的。从小虽读过一两年书，但十来岁就在附近各村庄扛小活。然后他又经历了贫农们通常所经历的许多副业，除了种地浇菜园子以外，他推车子、卖豆腐干、豆腐丝、打铁、烧窑、卖油醋、打棉花子、贩马、卖腊、做雇工、当兵、当马队、……还贩卖过私盐。他和鲁西一般农民一样，从小就酷爱武艺。但他因为穷，无钱拜师，是偷着学的。后来为了在外边踢场子失败了，本村人怕丢脸，才允许他参加本村的场子练武，拜了老三爷刘厚义为师。（这刘厚义后来成为黑旗军的将领之一）但宋景诗后来的师父很多，而给他以巨大影响的则是西汪村的孙汝镜。据说宋景诗拜孙汝镜为师的那天，穿的很整齐。孙汝镜看见他便叫自己妻子去找粪?子。宋说：“我去。”孙汝镜说：“你这么干净，干这个不行。”宋景诗把衣裳一脱，裤腿一卷，跳到粪池里就挑起粪来。孙汝镜这才收他为徒。
    一八五四年即清咸丰四年，太平天国第二批北伐军打下冠县、莘县、临清，曾两次驻军于离岗屯十二里的冠县清水镇。宋景诗曾和许多农民去迎接过太平军。而孙汝镜也就在这时和另外十几个徒弟投了军。临清撤退后，孙汝镜曾回到宋景诗所住的小刘贯庄呆了好几天。然后和太平军往南走了。临走的时候，许多徒弟都郑重地向师父叩头告别，并把他所遗下的大刀奉为珍物，相戒不去动它。宋景诗无疑地是从孙汝镜这里初步接受了革命思想。这时他已经学了全身武艺，便开始了两种新的职业：打拳卖艺与保家护院。——这是宋景诗闯荡江湖、结交英雄好汉、为革命找寻领导人物所能采取的公开职业。王韬的“瓮牖余谈”就肯定过这种职业的革命目的性。说他是乘此劝人“谋逆”。
    一八六○年即咸丰十年，山东全省除去登州外“其余九府二直隶州”都普遍地掀起了抗粮运动。农民们说那时候连年灾荒，大家都是“吃糠咽菜”，“活不下去”。物价高，地价贱，扛活不值钱，地主用高利贷剥削贫农，贱价收购土地。而银价涨，地丁都按银子算；漕粮又受贪官污吏层层剥削，特别是交不上整斗的贫农，遇到一种叫“挖升子”的衙蠹，“交三斗还不够他三升挖的。”催粮的衙役叫
    “罗伞”，“进门先吃饭，临走要拿钱。——不给要抓人，漕粮还得照样完。”在诸种剥削压迫下，堂邑、冠县、莘县、馆陶等县农民就由大粮小粮问题，爆发了抗粮运动。所谓大小粮，是依地土的肥沃与贫瘠而规定纳粮多寡的一种等级制度，但在附加团练费捐税上地主们想将负担转嫁于贫农，竟异想天开，废除了这种等级，要大小粮平均分摊。——实际上因为捐税数字是固定的，这就等于“把小粮鼓捣成大粮，大粮鼓捣成小粮”了。县官又和地主勾结起来，贫农抗缴的就被关进监狱，“打官司又打不过地主。”这时候宋景诗站出来领导了农民的抗粮运动。
    宋景诗本是个性情柔和，不暴不躁，好脾气，少说话的人，人家都叫他“宋丫头”、“宋妞儿”。但他听到街上人对大小粮的事议论纷纷，就说：
    “这太不公平了，大家不要完！”宋景诗带领着男女老少，扛着木锨、锄头、犁、耙……去到县衙门，说：“地也不要种了，种了地还不够交钱粮的！”县官没了法，临时答应了农民免交，并允许
    “立碑为记”。但事后马上派人来抓宋景诗。农民们说：“宋跑走，就起义了。”但也有的说：宋被抓进监狱，朋友们劫牢反狱，救他出来才起义的。
    但一般所传说的“劫牢反狱”是在冠县，而且是宋景诗去救人，不是被救。宋景诗的入狱可能更早，或者入狱后不久又放出来了。因为抗粮的农民“三五一群”地在一起，“明散暗聚”，在冠县清水镇、白塔集附近的韩村、赵庄及靠近馆陶的燕儿庄一带逐渐聚集起来了；从咸丰十年冬十月到十一年的二月，农民集合了万余人，“抗官闹漕”，竖立义旗。而农民们说这都是宋景诗领导的。
    二月十九日，是民间流传的观音诞辰，各处都有庙会。宋景诗便乘机邀集了许多英雄好汉，——一部分是鲁西一带白莲教的领袖们，去冠县劫牢反狱。去的人很多，但到冠县城只剩下十八个人了。这十八个人乔装改扮，装做卖柴禾的、卖艺的混进了城。半夜里在城里放起一把火，大嚷大叫：“反了！反了！”城外接应的有的颈上挂着响铃乱跑，——好像很多人马。有的爬墙进了城。城里官兵不多，闻警都开城逃去。大家打开监狱，救出许多革命所需要的人物，反出冠县，这就作为鲁西农民大起义的信号，农民革命军便由此分向各州县进攻了。
    宋景诗所领导的群众，主要是参加抗粮运动的农民。但进行武装起义的农民当中有十分之六是白莲教的信徒。——这就是说：鲁西农民大起义是宋景诗联合着白莲教共同领导的。从劫牢反狱事件起或者从抗粮运动起就是如此。
    宋景诗本人不是白莲教徒，这是各种材料所证明了的。但他与白莲教许多领袖都有着深厚的友谊，特别是有着共同的革命要求，所以他们联合得很好。
    白莲教在鲁西一带也并不是统一的整体，主要分莘县和邱县两个系统。莘县白莲教以延家营的从家为首领。从家的从政是个老叛徒，他在道光年间领导白莲教起义失败，被充军到新疆，后来叛变了革命才被赦回来的；遂和他的主张“造反”的儿子从世钦等之间存在着矛盾。延家营从家在教里的领导权似乎便因此而转移到冠县七里韩村杨泰的手中。冠县和堂邑岗屯一带接壤，而宋景诗在韩村附近也护过院，所以从抗粮以至劫狱与宋景诗合作的，是代表莘县系统白莲教的杨泰。杨泰在劫狱前就成立了以他自己为领导的军事组织——所谓五大旗：杨泰和他儿子杨朋岭等立的都是绿旗，张玉怀等黄旗，程顺书等白旗，靳三、郜四等红旗；黑旗便是特殊人物——非教徒宋景诗所领导的。而邱县系统的白莲教，则以临清侯家庄（靠近邱县）的张善继为领袖，也成立以他为领导的五大旗。但同样也有一个特殊例外，他的五大旗之中的黑旗也是以非教徒的宋景诗为领袖。莘县和邱县两个系统的五大旗都很倚重宋景诗，宋景诗的黑旗军也就接受了双方的领导和指挥。而莘县与邱县之间，由于杨泰是张善继的徒弟，张善继便做了两大系统名义上的总领袖——教主。
    冠县劫狱的信号一起，莘县、邱县两大系统的五大旗包括宋景诗的黑旗军在内，在统一领导之下，以冠县为中心，向各县武装进军。张玉怀是莘县大李王庄人，便率军攻下莘县，继续攻取朝城、观城，并进军直隶清丰。杨朋岭攻下馆陶，渡过卫河，与张善继部队会合。而张善继部下孙全仁则先已攻入了邱县。宋景诗和其它首领先占领了东昌府之西南重镇沙镇。由此，以雷凤鸣等部队往北攻克堂邑县；以郜四等部队往南攻克阳谷，占领运河沿岸张秋、七级、阿城诸镇，进围寿张；而宋景诗自己则担任了最困难的攻坚战——围攻东昌。在围攻东昌的同时，杨泰与张善继联合进军，一连攻克范县、濮州、曲周、清河、广平诸县城，并围攻大名、威县，进军临清、武城。东昌的围攻达两个多月，虽然没有攻克，但农民起义军已经占领了主要商业区的东关旧米市街礼拜寺一带。并两渡运河，进攻清平、博平县境。而更重要的，是在沙镇和明新、乌尔贡札布、秦际隆等清军进行了一次大会战，明、秦均被杀得坠下马来，兵勇溃散伤亡殆尽；乌尔贡札布和明新因此都逃往茌平，秦际隆闭城死守，不敢出战。是由于宋景诗在东昌阻击、牵制并消灭了敌人的主力部队，才使得其它农民革命军顺利地连拔一十三座县城，进攻二十余县，获得辉煌胜利，并扩大自己的队伍到五万人至十万人。
    农民起义军的伟大胜利与发展壮大，是由于他们符合并代表了农民的革命要求。他们在“抗粮”运动的基础之上，在政治上提出“兴汉灭胡”、“扫清立明”的口号，唱出“小鞑儿不识羞，谁人保你二百秋？”的歌谣，张贴了“受气二百载，咱也报报冤”的布告。在经济上则号召“替天行道”、“劫富济贫”。他们到处打开地主豪绅的粮仓，公开放粮；并将大户的钱财衣物分给贫民。攻下县城后便是“发狱，火库，毁武营官廨”，因而“穷民运厫粟出城者，旁午于道。”农民们说，对于起义军是“贫户说他好，好户说他孬。”于是“从乱者如归”了。宋景诗的部队在起义以后，据说尽赶八大集。“一百人进去，二百人出来”；“一集几十，再一集就是几百”了，特别是青年农民，参军的更加踊跃，许多十几岁的孩子都参加了。有个王玉柱，冠县张庄人，“一天挑挑子遇到黑旗。人家对他一叫：‘到咱这里来吧！’他撇下挑子，家也不回就参加了。”在我们所调查的堂邑县一百○二个村庄中，除了白官屯这个村子有一块匾躺在地下，用“端人正士”四个字证明了它是唯一的没有人参加“造反”的以外，其余任何一个村庄都“短不了在黑旗的”。（农民们每每拿黑旗代表整个起义军。）而且像臭虫张庄只有两家没参加起义。夏庄只有一家半“好人”：——陈半家，郑好人。因为陈家弟兄俩只参加了一个。白塔集是上千住户的大集，也“只有三家不吃‘反叛’的饭。”而岗屯一带更是不用说，都是“清一色”了。就连地主武装堡垒柳林和范寨里，农民们也举得出参加黑旗的人的姓名来。因此当时的农民兴奋地说：“光听说反了，也不知道是么事儿。等来了出去一看，好！他奶奶的啥反叛呀？都是老乡！——尽是俺庄上的人！”
    在各旗军队中，由于纪律严明，军民关系好，尤其是战斗力强，宋景诗的黑旗军是特别坚强而壮大。除了一般抗粮的农民大半都在宋景诗的黑旗军里。还有堂邑、冠县一带“閧花”斗争中的农民以及“私盐贩”也多参加了黑旗。“閧花”是贫农捡拾地主棉田中残余棉花而与地主所雇的打手经常冲突的一种斗争，有许多领导这种斗争的人物如杨二马、夏三姑等都率领农民参加了起义。宋景诗自己贩过私盐，并同他们一起坐过监牢，因此他们参加起义军的有数千人。另外，朝城张鲁集——全集三千户十分之九都是回民——回民们在回民地主马岐山领导之下，组织了西域回民大队，也参加起义。但因为和白莲教教义不合，便投入了黑旗军。因此，有这样可能，就是非教徒的群众大半都归了黑旗领导。
    三、农民起义军的胜利、妥协及其再起义
    起义军连拔一十三座城池，占领了鲁西及直隶边境一带广大平原地区，已经突入所谓畿辅重地。杨泰和张善继并且都做了皇帝。满清朝廷大为震动，乃调兵遣将，派往山东。除了二月间由山东巡抚清盛所派来的明新步队及僧格林沁所派来的乌尔贡札布的骑兵在东昌都被黑旗军打得伤亡殆尽；新任巡抚谭廷襄在四月末也带着保德率领济南兵到了东昌。这是东路。四、五月间又派胜保督办直隶山东军务，由威县临清分三路向邱县、冠县、濮州进攻。这是西路。南路则叫僧格林沁凭着黄河之险，阻挡着渡河与捻军结合之路。五月半僧格林沁并又派遣蒙古都统西凌阿与副总管恒龄率领骑兵驻军东昌，以备北路。想用压倒的优势兵力把起义军镇压下去。
    从阴历四月半起，胜保由威县越卫河向东南进攻；五月中旬起西凌阿、恒龄由东昌向西南进攻。到六月十九日止，两路大军，仿佛是势如破竹，一连攻陷邱、冠、馆陶、堂邑、莘、朝城、观城七座县城和下堡寺、尖塚、桑阿、白塔、幞头、岗屯、七里韩村、大李王庄及沙镇诸重要据点。而实际情况依农民说则是“胜保连打七个败仗”。——起义军以若干空城，换取了七次歼灭胜保大军的辉煌胜利。而结果是胜保在获得空城以后，倒反“退到卫河以北”的威县去，起义军“追出一百多里地”，整个战局改变了形势。原来起义军的有生力量毫未削弱，他们又在几个县城之间的许多据点里纷纷出现。特别是堂邑、冠县、临清、莘县、朝城之间一片广大地区，南起莘、朝之丈八、大厂，中经堂、冠之桑阿、贾镇、岗屯，北至馆陶之杨坟，全部为起义军所“漫延”、“充斥”。并且从莘县、朝城与观城之间突出三枝人马，反攻到卫河以北的曲周、邱县、馆陶、临清、清河一带，到达了胜保的后方。胜保这才不得不退回威县去，以保卫北路畿辅重地。
    这时出现了一个新局面。胜保军队遭受严重的损失，只换取了在被包围中的几座空城。不能再战了。而起义军同样也遭遇到严重的危机。农民们说：“庄稼人打了胜仗，认为官兵不敢再来，都想回家去种地。——这一来人就散啦！”并解释说：“庄稼人三天看不见庄稼就别扭啦！”宋景诗的黑旗军这时也“慢慢少了，撑不住劲”了。这是一。六月初五日莘县撤退时，杨泰不幸阵亡，六月十七日张善继由朝城攻回直隶，在沙河县被擒牺牲。半个多月损失了两大领袖。这是二。而因此可能引起了起义军内部的混乱与矛盾。农民说：“五大旗几个大元帅闹家务，宋景诗再顶不住，别的旗就都‘哗啦’了。”而且宋景诗“写文书调别的旗，别的旗不上北去。”这是三。存在这三大危机的起义军，和胜保之间产生了临时妥协的可能。
    胜保本是个以“招抚”为能事的人物，捻军在黄河以南又五路围攻僧格林沁，满清政府也希望抽出胜保的力量去进攻捻军。于是由胜保主动的“招抚”——妥协计划开始了。他首先向宋景诗进攻。这是他“擒贼擒王”之计，他知道宋景诗是起义军“倚以为重”的人物，而且是有矛盾弱点存在的人物。
    胜保利用了三个人物向宋景诗进攻：第一个是老叛徒从政，他以白莲教的首领地位劝降，利用并夸大白莲教内部矛盾以及与宋景诗之间的矛盾来瓦解领袖间的团结。第二个是张鲁集的马岐山，胜保把他的西域回民大队先收编为民团。这等于说马岐山先已投降了胜保，以西域回民大队的武装叛变来威胁宋景诗，然后劝他也同样投降。第三个是宋景诗的“恩人”王百龄，又叫王二香。这是一个花言巧语能“把死人说活了”的恶霸、讼棍和地主。他仗着曾经有“恩”于宋景诗，便代表胜保也代表了地主利益，向宋景诗横说竖说，“双方说合”，“两面作保”，诱降宋景诗。
    “山东军兴纪略”说宋景诗在六月十三日左右便向胜保部下成禄请降，而且胜保并立即到莘县燕甸前线受降，是装点门面的胡说。因为同书说六月二十二日成禄派遣戈什赵玉林等至宋营给发功牌、旗帜、军火，令五日后候点验，而“玉林等几为所杀”。是妥协谈判根本没成立。“纪略”又说六月十七、十九等日宋景诗替满清军队进攻朝城、观城，也是不攻自破的造谣，因为莘县县志说“七月十六日教匪宋景诗”还在“复陷邑城”。——但谈判最后是成立了的，不过经过王百龄花言巧语，“两面作保”之后，这个在平等地位上的谈判，事后是变质为片面的“招抚”——即所谓“投降”了。农民们对这件事有这样的说法：“宋二帅（景礼）说：王二香卖了他哥哥。”宋景诗在地主、政客、官僚、叛徒们的包围之中被欺骗、被出卖了。
    当时谈判的具体条件是什么，王百龄等等如何具体地欺骗宋景诗，以及宋景诗当时主观上如何应付这个骗局等等，都是无从调查了。但看到后来宋景诗等渡过黄河以后的斗争，这次妥协之被欺骗、被出卖是可以肯定的。
    宋景诗与胜保的谈判，大约在阴历七月底才正式获得协议。而到十一月二十五日，农民起义军的大部分将领包括张玉怀、杨泰的儿子杨朋岭、程顺书、雷凤鸣、从世钦、马荣等等都和胜保取得了协议。而在八月初到十一月之间的三个月中，白莲教起义军内部可能有了一次新的布置与调整，这就是以延家营的从家为首重新成立一个五大旗；从世钦并以黄袍加身，强迫从政继张善继、杨泰之后做皇帝，结果从政气死。又经过和胜保进行了若干次战斗，这才获致全面的妥协。而宋景诗在这时期和白莲教依然保持了一定的友谊和默契。“官”书既承认白莲教军故意“扬言恨景诗”，“阳与景诗为难”。而在胜保进攻延家营派宋景诗去攻打南门和西门时
    “宋景诗拿着大刀空喊不杀人，把人放走了好多。”直到今天，延家营的农民还以感激的心情在谈论着这件事。这说明了宋景诗与胜保妥协之后是没有背叛过友军、没有背叛过人民的。
    宋景诗的黑旗军以及其他各旗没有背叛人民，更主要的是从以下许多行动，特别是渡黄河的斗争中表现出来。
    当咸丰十一年十一月底全面妥协达成后，黑旗及其它各旗名义上是“暂扎馆陶、临清、大名”一带，静候“随征”。而实际上战士们都分散回家，“无意南征”。胜保和谭廷襄便请出聊城大绅士杨绍和及各县民团团长去堂邑、冠县、莘县各处“挨庄查逐，责令归营”。这就证明起义军与胜保的谈判中或者根本没承认过要帮助反动统治阶级去“剿”捻；或者是被骗答应过，而用这一分散回家的办法来对付。这办法相当成功，起义军原来有五万人到十万人，而最后渡河时只勉强凑了七营——三千余人，而且延迟到同治元年正月半才到黄河边。
    对于渡河“随征”，起义军是用各种方法来抗拒的。渡河之前，张玉怀和杨朋岭都“私豢死党”，宋景诗更“潜遣（三）弟（宋）景书及张丕烈引众六七百人”分布在堂邑、莘县一带，做了必要的潜伏准备。到了临渡河时，张玉怀、杨朋岭突然“借词无船、糗糒将尽，吹角酇队，引马步二千余回奔东北”，终于拒绝渡河，回到山东老根据地——冠县清水镇一带。宋景诗及雷凤鸣等部队先渡了河的，被胜保拖到安徽太和及河南陈州。但不到一个月，宋景诗抓到一个机会也拉了部队“哗变”了；由太和直奔陈州，邀了雷凤鸣的部队，一同回军开封，要从这儿渡河北归。但雷凤鸣突然变卦，向满清河南巡抚郑元善屈膝。宋景诗一时“觅渡不得”，便由开封绕兰仪，回柳园黑冈，再沿黄河至中牟、荣泽京水镇，沿岸都又遭“提船禁渡”的封锁；同时“官兵四集”，有以武力消灭他的可能；宋景诗眼看渡河计划趋于失败，马上抓了个胜保派人找他回去的机会就顺水推舟，暂时又回到安徽。
    张玉怀、杨朋岭等拒绝渡河的部队回到冠县，一时似无明确的方向。满清朝廷要“四面截杀，免贻后患。”但山东巡抚谭廷襄深知利益，“力主抚议。”因为各旗在乡的人达数万，一动刀兵，必然又逼出大事来。就用了个毒辣的政策：“分遣员弁谕劝莘、堂、冠、馆民团具保，勒缴马械。”将起义农民交给“民团具保”，等于把生杀大权交给地主；“勒缴马械”是向地主缴械。这不仅是打垮了农民的武装力量，而同时培植、壮大了地主的权力与武装。在敌人此种毒计之下，张杨等当时如何对付，无从调查。但莘、堂、冠、馆四县的地主气焰日张，拒绝渡河以及散处农村的广大农民又遭遇到迫害，就造成“乡团（地主的民团）降众（起义农民）猜嫌日甚，祸变将起”的局势。莘县、临清、馆陶各处村庄就不断产生小规模的武装抗拒和起义。这时候，在黄河南岸的宋景诗没有忽视农民这种灾难。六月里，派遣了他的二弟宋景礼和大将杨殿乙——即杨二马鞯回到堂邑：“自言奉胜保檄令，回东招旧部马勇赴营。”并针对着谭廷襄的毒计说：“如马给乡团，准即牵回；或已变卖，准本勇回赎。”这就重重地打击了地主的气焰，因此“乡团大哗。”可惜宋景礼不久便被王百龄活活气死，杨殿乙只得率领了一部分“旧部”潜伏下来，因为宋景诗在七月中又被胜保拖去陕西了。
    胜保去陕西进攻在西北起义的回民，便把宋景诗的部队拖去以壮声威。宋景诗本是“骁勇善战”的，部下又都是“百战之余”。但过了黄河以后，在安徽与捻军以及在陕西与回民作战却“屡败衄”了。据李静慈作“关于农民革命领袖宋景诗的二三纪事和传说”（西北艺术学院出版：“艺术生活”第五、六期合刊）文中给了解答说：原来宋景诗对于回民起义武装采取了“联络”和“避让”的办法。一方面应付直接管辖他的胜保，另一方面避开与回民军队冲突，以便保存自己的实力。而且和回民军队建立了很好的友谊。因此，胜保奏报说宋景诗如何“剿捻”“剿回”有功，根本是他“讳败为胜，捏报大捷”，以及替宋景诗“代为捏报战功”的胡说。而说宋景诗“屡败”的也是由于胜保“屡败”来推断的。——胜保的浑号就叫“败保”。事实上宋景诗既没胜也没败，根本是没打。而且陕西郃阳等地农民至今还流传一只歌谣，说明宋景诗和胜保是代表了两种截然不同的军队：“宋景诗，来没事；若要好，杀胜保。”宋景诗的部队在陕西不仅没有背叛人民，而本质上依然是人民的军队！即使在他后来重渡黄河那样危急状态之下，它和人民的关系还保持得很好：在郃阳坊镇和灵村驻扎时“军纪很好，老百姓给他们送水送饭，妇女见了也不甚怕。……真是鸡犬不惊。”而且依然执行“打富济贫”的基本政策，“分了几家大财东（如三益堂）的粮食。”
    鲁西农民在地主阶级疯狂的压迫与进攻之下，偷生不得，从同治元年七月起新的起义又接连地在冠县、馆陶、莘县以及直隶边境爆发。但由于各自为政，没有联合更没有统一领导，此起彼伏，遂被满清军队各个击破。到了十月，以张锡珠、杨朋山（朋岭之弟）为首的一枝起义军在临清起义，开始虽然仅仅五十余人，但他“飚疾如风”地奔驰于山东直隶之交的大平原上，把分散各地的再起义的农民集合起来，又联合了张玉怀、杨朋举（朋岭之弟）郜四等的部队，不到一个月，便扩大到五六千人；到十二月间，人数就“逾万”了。同时，在堂邑岗屯、柳林一带，由于地主杨鸣谦、王百龄等的民团被培植壮大了，不仅屠杀迫害一般农民，连宋二帅（景礼）都被气死，并声言要杀宋景诗全家。而柳林团更与满清军队勾结起来，到处横行，并且出境进攻起义军，成为起义军的生死对头。——在这情况下，起义军与一般农民都渴望着宋景诗能够回来，而宋景诗果然在接到宋三帅（景书）的信以后引军东归。
    同治元年十二月初，宋景诗抓住胜保逮京问罪和多隆阿新旧交替的机会，向多隆阿要求前往三原驻防，但“行至郃阳县露井地方”，突然“改路由东北而去”荣河县境白马渡。因为多隆阿这时正在大量裁减胜保原有部队，宋景诗在一路之上，遇到“各隘防军诘问，辄称：‘遣撤回籍之勇。’”避免了沿途的拦阻。对防河外委郭亮送了贿赂，特别是获得当地人民的协助，宋景诗率领的“马队一千五百人和步队三百余人”就从白马渡以炭船安然渡过黄河天险，“反回来”了。
    满清政府一听到这消息惊惶失措，慌乱万状。急忙叫直隶、山西、河南、山东各省总督巡抚以及多隆阿四面派兵追赶、堵截。不许宋景诗人马有“一名东归”！
    十二月初六日（一八六三年一月二十四日）以后，宋景诗率军由稷山走平阳府大路，直奔赵城。北走灵石韩侯岭由介休、平遥、寿阳至平定州，入直隶界。经井陉、获鹿、南宫、清河入山东，于十二月二十六日（二月十三日）抵达临清州。在赵城时搪回了常海的追赶；在井陉和南宫时对直隶总督两次派来劝阻的人，回答说：“归去甚切，”大家要“回籍省亲”，或“回家过年”。逼得满清政府哭笑不得。最初还说要宋景诗“呈缴马械”；后来又说“万一不肯……或酌给价值，以买为缴。”最后不得不被迫承认“其为急欲回籍无疑。”只好让他全体“东归”了。并一相情愿地说：“着令其剿张锡珠以自赎”，为自己遮羞而下台。宋景诗在一路之上除了向各州县“讹诈银两”以外，对老百姓“秋毫无犯”。（清廷也承认说：“并无骚扰。”）避开可能的战斗，争取机会以风驰电掣般的急行军迳奔山东。既到临清，分兵驻守。半月以后，便移军堂邑，以岗屯为大本营，向地主阶级展开靱性的斗争了。
    四、黑旗军对地主武装及满清军队的英勇战斗
    鲁西农民起义以来，在战斗上所遭遇到的最顽强的敌人并不是胜保、西凌阿、谭廷襄之类的军队，而是各县的地主武装——民团。这些民团分散在各个村庄里，成为农民军的心腹之患。在咸丰十一年间许多战斗中，几乎每一次都有民团的“助剿”，才造成起义军在军事上的若干困难。否则，胜保等是早就被歼灭了的。据“山东军兴纪略”所载就发现有：朝城、阳谷、武城、东阿、聊城、茌平、清平、博平、东平、邯郸、邱县、大名、清丰、内黄、寿张、临清、元城、威县、曲周、南乐等二十余县民团和起义军进行过战斗。而每县都有十个到三十个团，平均每团一千人，这就为满清反动军队平添了几十万武装。
    但在上述的二十多县民团中偏偏没有冠县、堂邑、莘县、馆陶四县的民团，并不是这四县的地主特别“开明”，而是这四县正处在革命中心，它的地主武装被伟大的农民起义威力镇压下去了。在如火燎原的形势之下，地主们不敢正面抗拒，只有阴谋捣鬼。如边庄的边简（后来是范寨的副团长之一）对本庄准备起义的农民说：“太阳那能尽晌午呀？”一瓢冷水把农民浇散了。又如焦庄的侯锦玉因为有武艺，能蹦能跳，他的本家怕他参加造反，就无端地挖了他的眼，挑断了他的大腿筋。而地主阶级在革命高涨中除了逃到大城市避难以外，他们并不屈伏或妥协的。像王占基（杨坟的富农，秀才）从狱里被宋景诗救出来，不仅不肯参加起义而且投官自首，终于参加了范寨民团和宋景诗黑旗军死拚到底。辛集的团长丁炳堂是个武举，宋景诗曾去劝他起义，却把宋景诗围起来，要捉去送官。……
    等到起义军与胜保进行妥协谈判的时候，堂、冠、莘、馆四县地主马上活跃起来，纷纷成立或者恢复他们的民团了。而在谭廷襄的“民团具保、勒缴马械”政策之下，就大大地培植并壮大了这些民团。所以在这时才出现了一批新起的以柳林团为首的地主武装。
    柳林，在岗屯之东约十五里，是堂邑县最大的镇。它的民团叫“永清团”，团长是杨鸣谦。行十，故被称十团长，或杨十。是个庠生。死后敕封鸾仪卫，并建立专祠。有十八顷地，他丈人又给他十多顷，共二三十顷地。永清团管辖柳林附近五十二个村庄，也分成五营四哨，拥有团丁约二千人。永清团被满清政府称为唯一的“良团”，是因为在农民们第二次起义的时候，它成了进攻与镇压革命势力的主力。它不仅杀了许多起义的农民，连张锡珠都曾经被它捉去过。它不仅消极地抵抗农民起义军，而且是积极地到处去进攻起义军。它除了一般团丁以外，还有个黑虎队，专门招收了一些亡命之徒如王希禄等，故颇有战斗力。
    范寨，在柳林之南十二里。它的团名叫“尚义”。团长是范景唐，武生，后来加守备衔，五品蓝翎。有十二顷地。他和丁宝桢拜过仁兄弟，恒龄、刘长佑、僧格林沁都在他家住过。当时范寨和柳林是一般横暴，农民们现在还说“范寨地皮硬，小孩都敢说大话，先前恶的厉害。”“范寨团是那里紧那里去救，不光是守圩子，常到外边去打仗。”地主们自豪地说：“柳林团英雄好汉，范寨团能杀惯战。”范寨团也豢养着一千八百个团丁，有相当的战斗力。被农民骂为忘恩负义的王占基是它的管队之一。
    范寨东南四五里是辛集。辛集的团叫“肃清团”。团长是王九龄，武举，辛集之北孔里庄人。有一顷多地。另一个团长就是曾经想过要捉宋景诗的丁炳堂，但不管事。辛集团被称为“半私半官”，是因为它的地界正在岗屯与范寨之间，被黑旗军打垮过一次以后所被迫采取的态度。王九龄的弟弟王九成曾经参加了宋景诗的黑旗军，后来虽然被骗回来了，但因此和黑旗军还有着一些“友谊”。
    辛集东约十里是宋小屯，它的民团叫“信实团”。当家的是副团长马景三，人称马老景。有二十八顷地，是个混人儿的大光棍。小屯的位置和岗屯之间隔着柳林、范寨和辛集，沾不着边。因此它和黑旗军的关系，正如马景三自己说的：“给黑旗军送点儿东西算什么？要是跟他打仗，一伤人，那损失可就大咧！”因此地主们讽刺它是：“小屯团送米送面”，或者是“小屯团见面就散”。和辛集一样是个两面派。
    堠堌集在柳林之东十五里，是堂邑通临清路上的重要集镇。它的团叫“永兴团”。团长梁兆祥，有八顷地，是个文生。或说他是花了一百零八两银子捐的监生。一般都说：“堠堌团是奶奶团净跑不打”，或者是“见仗就散”，甚至是“熊种王八蛋”。但实际上并不是堠堌团不跟农民武装对敌，而是和辛集一样，曾经被黑旗军包围过，缴了械，这才和黑旗妥协的。
    岗屯及其附近二十一个村庄也成立了民团，这个团叫“忠爱团”。团长就是说合宋景诗和胜保妥协的王百龄——王二香。领队的是有名的刽子手王占鳌。——后来也投了范寨。
    当宋景诗率军回到临清以后，经过一个很短的“半私半官”时期。这时期他被命令着去剿张锡珠，而实际上和张锡珠是“暗通声气”并“接济军火”。同时，公开地以“添募马勇”名义扩大部队到三千人，并以“合法”的地位争取驻兵到堂邑岗屯来。同治二年正月底，他把部队从临清一路布置到岗屯，就公开地表明态度向地主武装展开了斗争。
    二月初八日宋景诗逮捕了欺骗、出卖过他的王百龄，驻兵岗屯及其附近，解散了或消灭了“忠爱团”。然后便向柳林、范寨进攻。从二月到八月之间，黑旗军对柳林、范寨是“白天打、黑夜打、见天儿打”，从没间断地一直打了半年。打得这两个顽强的地主武装，不仅不能再进攻农民起义军，
    （特别是张锡珠、张玉怀等部队。）而且被围在圩子里只有被打的份儿。据范寨的一块碑文上说宋景诗黑旗军与范寨团曾经打了“大小七十余战”，而攻打柳林的次数比范寨更多。
    对于辛集、小屯、堠堌三个团，黑旗军采取了分化政策。在堂邑县西南王朝营一次会战当中，黑旗军和所有的团交战，但对辛集、堠堌等团取得一定胜利之后，便和他们罢手，取得了妥协。并在柳林、范寨周围划下了地界，对地界以外地区的其它几个团都声言不打。这就孤立了柳林和范寨，便于集中军力向这两个团围攻。并且在全军中唱出这样的歌谣来激励将士们：“攻开柳林团，吃喝得两年，娶个媳妇不作难。先杀杨九、十，（杨十即杨鸣谦，杨九指其兄杨锡璋）后杀二红砖（姓许，叫许老韶，前营营长之一），五营四哨齐杀净，当中留着个乔庙的步老先（步老先即步超然，是柳林副团长，因为善于笼络人，农民对他感情还好。）”
    柳林和范寨在孤立无援形势下，便死守不出。“黑旗军脱下棉袄铺在地上，坐下来骂，睡下来骂，”杨鸣谦总是高挂免战牌。三月二十四日宋景诗先在柳林南门外土坯后埋伏了人马，再以轻骑诱敌。杨鸣谦轻敌穷追，遂中了农民所艳称的、有名的土坯计，被黑旗擒斩。黑旗军同时把被囚的王百龄也拉出来杀了。这可大大鼓舞了农民的信心和士气，岗屯一带万众腾欢，而黑旗军也壮大到一万人以上，黑旗军的势力范围也扩大到“东到聊城，西到冠县，南到阳谷，北到临清。”——但作为心腹之患的柳林与范寨还是没打下。
    柳林杨家派了杨锡嘏和王百龄的儿子王岁丰组织了请兵团到淄川哭请僧格林沁派兵援救。恒龄被派来了，刘长佑和丁宝桢也来了，最后僧格林沁自己也来了。但黑旗军对于柳林、范寨还是不曾放松一步，一有了机会就打，用各种计策打。甚至到了小刘贯庄撤退以后，从山东到直隶，再回山东，一渡卫河，两渡运河，驰驱千里，绕了一个好大的圈子回来，还是专意攻打柳林。但可惜，柳林的命运虽濒于“仅得未陷”，而终于是没打下来。农民们对此不胜惋惜地说这是因为宋景诗不愿伤害百姓。比如国寨的老人说：“黑旗军杀了杨十那次，本来可以攻进柳林的，可是宋大帅不愿多伤农民，就下令停止进攻。”这是善良的农民们对这个无可奈何的遗憾为宋景诗所寻找的安慰之词。
    后来，宋景诗离开山东去参加太平军之前，沿路之上所遭遇到的地主武装的阻拦与截杀更是不可胜数。黑旗军对于这些民团所进行的战斗也最剧烈。同治四年春，他又重回山东，沿路就扬言还要“回柳林报仇”。虽然这次只是跟敌人开的玩笑，他的真正目的是在诱敌追入山东，好在曹州地区歼灭僧格林沁大军。但他和地主阶级的仇恨真是海样的深了。（明日续完）
