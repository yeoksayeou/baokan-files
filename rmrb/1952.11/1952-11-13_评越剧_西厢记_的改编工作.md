    Critique of the Adaptation of Yue Opera "Romance of the West Chamber"
    Dai Fan
    The Yue Opera troupe affiliated with the Cultural Department of the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission achieved certain successes in the adaptation work of the Yue Opera "Romance of the West Chamber" performed at the National Opera Observation and Performance Conference. In their work of popularizing this classic masterpiece, they adopted a relatively serious attitude, based on Wang Shifu's original work, with Zhang Sheng and Yingying as the protagonists, changing the treatment of making Hongniang the protagonist, and no longer having Hongniang alone mediate in the matter, which put the protagonists in a passive position. This is in line with the theme of the original story of "Romance of the West Chamber".
    The Yue Opera "Romance of the West Chamber" develops the story up to "Crying at the Banquet". This is a relatively clean treatment. According to legend, Wang Shifu died from exhaustion when he wrote the beginning of the "Long Pavilion" scene of "Romance of the West Chamber," "Azure sky, yellow flowers earth..." Although this is not entirely credible, from this legend, we can vaguely see the attitude of predecessors towards the ending of "Romance of the West Chamber." They were very dissatisfied with the plot after "Long Pavilion." The ending of "Wang West Chamber" is "Startled Dream," using a dream to replace reunion, which was a beautiful imagination in Wang Shifu's time, but today it seems a bit too bleak. In addition, if Yingying were treated as eloping, it would not be very likely in terms of reasoning. Although Yingying and Zhang Sheng have a certain anti-feudal spirit, due to their class conditions, character, and the era and position they were in, their combativeness could not be highly intense. If their combativeness were very strong, Zhang Sheng should have argued on principle when Madam went back on her word, and Yingying should have stood up bravely and reasoned with her mother at the latest after "Interrogation of Hongniang," instead of waiting until after "Crying at the Banquet" to secretly escape with her mother in the middle of the night. Therefore, the method adopted by the adapters of Yue Opera "Romance of the West Chamber," appropriately strengthening Yingying's resistance and ending the plot at the Long Pavilion farewell, leaving Yingying's ending for the audience to judge, does not harm the theme and integrity of the story.
    The adapters put some effort into the handling of the scenes. For example, they combined the original "Startled Beauty" and "Borrowing the Chamber" into one scene, and omitted the clear scene of Huiming sending the challenge, making the whole play more concise. On the other hand, the adapters also removed the nonsense and erotic parts of the original work, performing "Disturbing the Study" up to Zhang Sheng going to the study, eliminating the appearance of the monks and the ugly scene of holding a grand Taoist ceremony for a dead feudal noble (Cui Xiangguo), and also removing the vulgar gimmicks of the monks winking at a woman in the Buddhist hall. "Responding to the Letter" is performed up to Yingying entering the room, deleting the erotic parts. Doing so does not harm the original plot, but makes the plot more compact and clean.
    In order to popularize classical works while still maintaining the essence of the original, the adapters have also made achievements in some aspects. For example, before "Responding to the Letter," the original only had half a set of Ci poetry, "Xian Lü" and "Dian Jiang Chun," sung by Zhang Sheng. Now, these seven poems have been changed into actions, lyrics, and monologues, using only three or four hundred words, while still expressing the spirit of the original, vividly portraying Zhang Sheng's face, and making the audience understand his anxious mood of waiting for his lover.
    From the above examples, it seems that the Yue Opera "Romance of the West Chamber" can basically grasp the spirit of the original in the treatment of some plots, and has taken a step forward on the basis of not damaging the original, which is an achievement that should be affirmed. However, judging from the performance effect, the Yue Opera "Romance of the West Chamber" is not very able to arouse emotional resonance in the audience, and the whole play seems a bit bland and even makes people feel dull.
    What is the reason for this?
    In addition to the shortcomings of the director and actors in grasping the roles, the main reason is that the adapters have not fully grasped and developed the thematic spirit of "Romance of the West Chamber," and there are still many shortcomings in the handling of the characters. The character colors are not distinct enough, the personalities are not prominent enough, and the impression on the audience is certainly not very profound.
    As for the female protagonist Yingying, she is loved by the audience because she has the courage to pursue a happy life, regardless of the class differences in feudal society, to sympathize with and fall in love with Zhang Sheng, a wandering scholar. Her kind character can touch the hearts of the audience. Wang Shifu, in the first half of "Temple Alert" and the two scenes of "Qin Xin" and "Reneging on the Marriage," delicately portrayed the feelings of this Xiangguo's daughter pitying Zhang Sheng everywhere, making the audience feel her deep affection. However, the adapters in the play did not portray Yingying's moving character more vividly. On the contrary, by stiffly changing the songs originally sung by Yingying alone into duets or group songs, they diluted the character's color. For example, in "Reneging on the Marriage," the original lyrics were all sung by Yingying. Singing Zhang Sheng's words from Yingying's mouth, "You are still worried now, what will you do later!" These places depict the passion and kindness of this young lady, but in the Yue Opera, these lyrics are changed to Zhang Sheng's self-narration: "It is still okay to be worried now, what will you do later." Such a change, while basically retaining the original words, weakens Yingying's character. In addition, appropriately strengthening Yingying's resistance within the limits allowed by the conditions at the time is also possible. Although the adapters have done some work on this, they have not achieved good results. Taking "Responding to the Letter" as an example, although Yingying sings "Mother! Even if you have iron walls and copper walls, I will spread my wings and fly," before deciding to send the letter a second time, such "aphorisms" have not moved the audience. This is because although the adapters have strengthened Yingying's rebellious words, they have not written why she would produce this rebelliousness, and have not deeply expressed the contradictory process of love overcoming feudal traditional concepts in Yingying's heart, so such rebelliousness is like being unrooted and therefore unmoving. In the last scene of the script, "Crying at the Banquet," according to the development of Yingying's character, this is the time for her to boldly express her attitude towards the feudal system, but what we hear is mostly Yingying's sad farewell words (these words are of course necessary), and there are very few words strongly expressing how dissatisfied she is with her mother's unreasonable decision, making this protagonist still appear quite weak in her last appearance. The audience cannot find her passion and kindness in Yingying, as well as her certain dissatisfaction with the feudal system, which is the basic reason why this character cannot move people.
    The handling of Zhang Sheng's character is also not complete enough. The adapters seem to be very eager to focus on depicting Zhang Sheng's boldness and enthusiasm, so on the one hand, they use Zhang Sheng's lyrics to depict his character, for example, in the scene of "Touring the Temple," when he sees Yingying going back, he actually sings the sentence "My heart itches and my bones ache," (Note: The three words "bones ache" seem to have evolved from the original "I understand the bone-penetrating love sickness," which is a bit too much); on the other hand, they also use Zhang Sheng's actions to show his infatuation, for example, in the same scene, after singing "How can I bear her turning her eyes away when she leaves," Zhang Sheng is also asked to "simulate Yingying's footsteps" (this is not in "Wang West Chamber"); on the other hand, the adapters also use the mouths of other characters in the play to describe Zhang Sheng's crazy appearance, for example, arranging for the qintong to appear before "Disturbing the Study," mocking Zhang Sheng "I see that you are not worshipping the Buddha, ah! It's like worshipping the Water Moon Guanyin," (this is also not in "Wang West Chamber"); of course, we are opposed to the adaptation work of adhering to the plot and original words of "Wang West Chamber," but the result of this treatment can easily make the audience misunderstand that Zhang Sheng is a frivolous young man, and it is difficult to sympathize with this character. Although Zhang Sheng is a relatively bold character, his position in that society is relatively low, he has also read some so-called "books of sages," and he is in a state of "drifting in the rivers and lakes," and the other party he encounters is the daughter of a Xiangguo. Under these conditions, if he is treated like a playboy, it violates the identity of the male protagonist arranged by the theme of the play (expressing the anti-feudal spirit through a pair of men and women with "different levels").
    The Yue Opera "Romance of the West Chamber" also treats the character of the Old Madam in a way that is not very reasonable. The Old Madam is not Yingying's stepmother, and this widow should take extra care of her only daughter. However, due to her strong feudal concepts (unwilling to marry a commoner daughter, especially an outsider like Zhang Sheng), this love for her daughter is completely misguided. Writing out the contradictory process of her feudal thoughts overriding her love for her daughter, to the point of disregarding her daughter's happiness and life, can expose the cruelty and evil of feudal society by strengthening her feudal nature. Admittedly, this point was not done well in "Wang West Chamber," but in the original, the first scene also writes that the Old Madam is very considerate of her daughter, and asks Hongniang to accompany her to the courtyard to relax; when Zhang Junrui is ill, she also asks Hongniang to "ask the doctor what medicine to prescribe, what is the disease, and what is the pulse like?" (Now they are all changed to dark scenes, and Yingying briefly mentions them, making people not impressed.) Writing this way makes it easier to see the true face of this Old Madam. In the Yue Opera "Romance of the West Chamber," the impression the Old Madam gives is consistently an old woman who is bent on breaking up her daughter's free marriage, who is fierce and almost unreasonable. This conceptualized and stereotyped character will not attract much attention from the audience. At most, it can only make the audience hate the Old Madam alone, and cannot make people rise to hate the irrational social system.
    In Peking Opera and some local operas, it is certainly not the most appropriate to treat Hongniang as the main character of "Romance of the West Chamber." The adapters of Yue Opera "Romance of the West Chamber" seem to be very aware of this, which is of course good; but the adapters have excessively weakened Hongniang's role, which makes it difficult to satisfy the audience. The complete "Romance of the West Chamber" has disappeared from the stage for many years, while "Hongniang" is still popular in various operas. This is of course because the old version of "Hongniang" has some erotic elements that can cater to the low-level tastes of the backward audience in the semi-feudal and semi-colonial society of the past; but it is undeniable that, after years of creation and accumulation on the stage, Hongniang has become a very distinct image, and her enthusiasm, boldness, and sense of justice are the main reasons why the audience loves her. However, in the Yue Opera "Romance of the West Chamber," her status is degraded even lower than in "Wang West Chamber." In "Wang West Chamber," several scenes such as "Previous Visit," "Disturbing the Letter," and "Later Visit" are all plays mainly about Hongniang, vividly showing Hongniang's role. Taking "Previous Visit" as an example, when Hongniang did not knock on the door and enter Zhang Sheng's room, in "Wang West Chamber," Hongniang first sings six songs from "Dian Jiang Chun" to "Yuan He Ling," which express Hongniang's sympathy for the love between Cui and Zhang; but the adapters have simplified the six songs into ten sentences of seven words each, and five of them seem to be mocking Zhang Sheng for "sitting upright with his clothes on" and "being crazy." For the sentences in the original "...lonely mood, no one to serve, astringent breath, gradually weakening voice, yellow and thin face, Zhang Sheng! If you don't die of illness, you should be bored to death." ("Village Drum"), which can express Hongniang's sympathy (sense of justice), they have been removed. Treating Hongniang like this is obviously not appropriate, because Hongniang played a big role in Cui and Zhang's love. At the same time, giving Hongniang the position she deserves, writing out her rich emotions and her good intentions, can also enrich the flesh and blood of the adaptation of "Romance of the West Chamber" and allow the audience to experience more of the people's nature in the play.
    In general, the character colors of the Yue Opera "Romance of the West Chamber" are not distinct and prominent enough, and it has failed to make people love and sympathize with those who should be loved, so it has failed to achieve the expected effect among the audience. This major shortcoming is of course partly due to the influence of "Wang West Chamber," but the main reason is that the adapters paid more attention to technical adaptation work (in this respect, there are gains), but less started from grasping the spirit of the original and carefully and thoroughly analyzed the situation of these characters and their inner contradictions. As a result, the personalities of Yingying and the Old Madam became simplified, Zhang Sheng fell into frivolity, and Hongniang's position was greatly weakened. Therefore, although the adaptation's selection of plots is better than the original, the entire script still lacks brilliance, lacks the dramatic effect created by the distinct contrast of character personalities, and therefore cannot give the audience enough ideological inspiration and aftertaste.
    Secondly, although this play has done some work in popularizing classical literature, it has not done enough. There are many problems in the language. In many places, the adapters have adopted the original sentences of "Wang West Chamber," making it quite difficult for the general audience to understand its meaning; in some places, the adapters seem to have inappropriately divided the original sentences in order to suit the form of Yue Opera lyrics. For example, in the same scene, Yingying originally sang "I think of Chang'e in the west, there is no one to share when the east rises," and the adaptation removes the three words "there is no one to share," which is not very appropriate to Yingying's mood; some places originally had very important lyrics for the protagonist, such as Yingying's original song "Mian Da Xu" in "Qin Xin": "How can I get someone to send a message, even if there are twelve Witches Peaks, there will be a dream in Gao Tang," which is now changed to a chorus outside the curtain "How can I get someone to send a message, only a dream in Gao Tang," which is also far inferior to the original. In short, the form of drama is to meet the audience on the stage. When changing the already declining Zaju into Yue Opera for modern people to watch, it is certainly not right to ask the ancients to speak modern slang, but it is also not very appropriate to use too much ancient spoken language. Maintaining the essence of the original should be solved from the root - strengthening the description of the theme and character personalities, and not starting from the technical extraction of the original language. Now, translating or using the spoken language in the opera hundreds of years ago into Yue Opera without melting it will naturally make the audience feel too literary and even unable to understand it.
    Adapting classical masterpieces is a heavy and complex task. In this regard, our experience is not rich enough. We should work harder on how to maintain and develop the positive significance of the original. Focus more on the development of the theme, the in-depth analysis of character personalities, and the proper and rational arrangement of the plot. We are adapting "Romance of the West Chamber" for modern people to watch, and the content of our "Romance of the West Chamber" should not remain at the ideological height of "Wang West Chamber." As long as it does not exceed the scope permitted by historical conditions, it is the responsibility of today's dramatists to improve the content of "Romance of the West Chamber" on the basis of the original with a realistic creative method, making this story more moving and more loved.

    评越剧“西厢记”的改编工作
    戴不凡
    人民革命军事委员会总政治部文化部所属的越剧团在全国戏曲观摩演出大会中演出的越剧“西厢记”，在改编工作上是取得一定成绩的。他们在使这部古典名著通俗化的工作中，采取比较严肃的态度，根据王实甫的原作，以张生和莺莺为主角，改变了以红娘为主角的处理方法，不再只由红娘一人在其中说情作合，使主角反处于被动的地位。这是符合“西厢记”原来故事的主题的。
    越剧“西厢记”把故事发展到“哭宴”为止。这是比较干净的处理方法。前人传说，王实甫写“西厢记”至“长亭”这一折的起首“碧云天，黄花地，……”时，精疲力尽而死。这虽然不足深信，但从这一传说，多少可隐约看出前人对“西厢记”结尾的态度。——他们对“长亭”以后的情节，是很不满意的。“王西厢”的结尾是“惊梦”，用梦来代替团圆，这在王实甫那个时代，不失为一个美丽的想像，可是今天看来未免有过于凄苦的感觉。另外，如果把莺莺处理成出走，就情理而论，是不大可能的。因为莺莺和张生虽然具有一定的反封建精神，但由于他俩的阶级条件、性格和所处的时代、地位，他们的斗争性不可能是高度强烈的。要是斗争性很强，张生在夫人赖婚时就该据理力争，莺莺至迟应在“拷红”后刚强地站出来和母亲讲理，不待“哭宴”后在半夜三更背母私逃。因此，如越剧‘西厢记’改编者所采取的方法，适当地加强莺莺的反抗性，在长亭送别时结束剧情，留下莺莺的结局给观众去判断，这是不妨害主题和故事的完整性的。
    改编者对场面的处理是用了一些力量的。例如，他把原来的“惊艳”和“借厢”合并成一幕，把惠明下战书的明场省去，使全剧比较精练。另一方面，改编者也去掉了原作中的胡闹和色情部分，将“闹斋”演至张生赴斋为止，免去了众僧出场，为一个已死的封建贵族（崔相国）大做道场的丑恶场面，也除去了和尚们在佛堂中对一个女性挤眉弄眼的庸俗噱头。“酬简”则演到莺莺入房为止，删除了色情的部分。这样做，并不损害原来的情节，而使剧情更紧凑和干净。
    使古典作品通俗化，而仍能保持原作的神韵，改编者在一些方面也做出了成绩。例如“酬简”之前，原作只有张生唱的“仙吕”“点绛唇”半套曲文，如今把这七支曲子改为有动作，有唱词，有独白，仅仅用了三四百字，而仍能表现出原作的精神，较生动地刻划出张生的面貌，使观众理会他等候情人的焦急心情。
    从上面所举的看来，越剧“西厢记”在若干情节的处理上，基本上还能掌握原作的精神，并在不损伤原作的基础上前进了一步，这是应当肯定的成绩。不过从演出效果看来，越剧“西厢记”却还不很能引起观众心情上的共鸣，全剧似乎有些平铺直叙，甚至于使人有沉闷之感。
    这是什么原因呢？
    除了导演和演员在掌握角色上的缺点以外，主要的是由于改编者没有充分掌握和发挥“西厢记”的主题精神，在人物处理上还存在着很多缺点。人物色彩不够鲜明，性格不够突出，给观众的印象当然是不会很深刻的。
    就女主角莺莺而说，她之所以会受到观众喜爱，是由于她具有追求幸福生活的勇气，不管封建社会中的门第之别，去同情并爱上了张生这位飘零的书生。她的善良的性格，是能够打动观众的心肠的。王实甫在“寺警”的前半折和“琴心”“赖婚”等两折，以高超的笔法，细腻地刻划出这位相国小姐处处怜悯张生的心情，使观众仿佛也感受到她的一往情深。可是，改编者在剧中并没有把莺莺这种动人的性格描绘得更鲜明一些，相反，由于生硬地把原本中莺莺一人独唱的曲子改为二人或数人对唱，反而冲淡了这个人物的色彩。例如“赖婚”时，在原本中原都是莺莺的唱词。从莺莺口中唱出张生“你而今烦恼犹闲可，你久后思量怎奈何！”这些地方描绘出这位小姐的热情和善良，但越剧中，却把这些唱词改为张生自述：“而今烦恼犹可过，久后思量怎奈何”，这样的改法，虽然基本上保留了原作的词句，但却削弱了莺莺的性格。另外，在不超过当时条件所许可的范围内，适当地加强莺莺的反抗性，也是可以的。改编者对此虽然做了一些工作，但并没有收到很好的效果。以“酬简”来说，莺莺在决定二次送信前，虽然唱着：“母亲哪！你纵有铁壁铜墙，我也自插翅飞奔”，可是，像这样的“警句”，并不曾使观众受到感动。这是由于改编者虽然加强了莺莺的反抗言语，但却没有写出她为什么会产生这种反抗性，没有深刻表达出莺莺内心中爱情战胜封建传统观念的矛盾过程，所以这样的反抗性，像是不扎根的，因此也是不动人的。在剧本的最后一场“哭宴”中，按莺莺的性格的发展，这是她大胆表露自己对封建制度的态度的时候，但我们所听到的，只是莺莺凄苦诉别之词为多，（这些话当然是有必要的）而强烈表示她如何不满母亲的无理决定的话语则很少，使这个主角在最后出场时还显得相当软弱无力。观众在莺莺身上不能很满足地找到她的热情和善良，以及她对封建制度的一定的不满情绪，是这个人物不能动人的基本原因。
    对张生这个人物的处理也不够完整。改编者似乎很想着重描写张生的大胆、热情，所以一面用张生的唱词来描绘他这种性格，例如“游寺”一场见莺莺回去时，竟唱出“我心里痒骨头酸”的句子来，
    （注：“骨头酸”三字似乎是从原本“我明白透骨相思病缠”中演化出来的，未免有些过火）；一面又用张生的行动来表示他的神魂颠倒，例如同场唱完了“怎当她临去秋波那一转”以后，还叫张生
    “模拟莺莺脚步”（这是“王西厢”中没有的）；另一方面，改编者还从剧中其他人物的口中，来描写张生的疯魔样子，例如“闹斋”前安排琴童出场，嘲笑张生“我看你不是拜菩萨，啊！倒像是去拜那水月观音”，（这也是“王西厢”中所没有的）；自然，我们是反对拘泥于“王西厢”情节和原词的改编工作的，可是这样处理的结果，很易使观众误会张生是个轻浮子弟，就很难对这个人物发生同情。张生虽然是一个比较大胆的人物，但他在那个社会中的地位是比较低微的，他也读过一些所谓“圣贤之书”，处在“湖海飘零”的境地中，遇到的对方则是个相国的女儿，在这些条件下，要是把他处理得如同一位花花公子，是违反本剧主题（通过“等级有别”的一对男女身上表现反封建的精神）所安排的这位男主角的身份的。
    越剧“西厢记”把老夫人这个人物，也处理得不很近情理。老夫人不是莺莺的后母，这位未亡人对自己的独养女儿应当倍加体惜。不过由于她存在着浓重的封建观念（不愿招白衣女婿，尤其是像张生这样的外路人），这种对女儿的爱是完全走错了路的。写出她的封建思想压倒了爱惜女儿的心情，以致不顾女儿的幸福与死活的矛盾过程，是可以从加强她的封建性上，来暴露封建社会的残酷和罪恶的。固然，这一点在“王西厢”中原也做得不够，可是在原本中，第一场也写出老夫人很体谅女儿，着红娘陪她去庭院散心；张君瑞病了，她还着红娘去“问太医下什么药，是何症候，脉息如何？”（现均改为暗场，由莺莺口中一言带过，使人印象不深。）这样写，比较可以看清这位老夫人的真面貌。而在越剧“西厢记”中，老夫人给人的印象，一贯的是个一心要拆散女儿自由婚姻，凶板板得几乎不近情理的老太婆。这种概念化和脸谱化的人物，是不会怎样引起观众注意的。最多只能使观众去仇恨老夫人一个人，而不能使人提高去仇恨那个不合理的社会制度。
    在京戏和一些地方戏中，把红娘处理成“西厢记”的主要人物，这当然不是最合适的。越剧“西厢记”的改编者似乎很注意这一点，这当然是好的；但是改编者过分削弱了红娘的作用，这就很难使观众满意了。全本“西厢记”在舞台上已绝迹多年，而“红娘”则尚在各种戏曲里面流行，这固然是因为“红娘”旧本中有些色情成分，可以迎合以前半封建半殖民地社会中落后观众的低级趣味；但不可否认的，经过舞台上多年来的创造和积累，红娘已经成为一个性格很鲜明的形象，她的热情、大胆和正义性，是观众喜爱她的主要原因。可是，越剧“西厢记”中却把她的地位贬得比“王西厢”中还低。在“王西厢”中，“前候”、“闹简”、“后候”等几折，全是以红娘为主的戏，很生动地显示出红娘的作用。以“前候”为例，红娘没有敲门入张生房中时，“王西厢”中红娘先唱从“点绛唇”到“元和令”六支曲子，这些曲文表现了红娘同情崔、张恋爱的心情；但改编者却把六支曲子简化为十句七言句，而其中五句好像还是在嘲笑张生“披衣危坐”“中疯魔”的。对于原作中“……凄凉情绪，无人服侍，涩滞气息，渐弱声息，黄瘦脸儿，张生呵！你不病死多应闷死。”（“村里迓鼓”）这样能表现红娘同情心（正义感）的句子，却加以割爱了。像这样处理红娘，显然不够恰当，因为在崔、张的恋爱中，红娘是起了很大作用的。同时，给予红娘以应得地位，写出她丰富的感情和一片好心肠，还可以丰富“西厢记”改编本的血肉，使观众在剧中体会到更多的人民性。
    总的说来，越剧“西厢记”人物的色彩都不够鲜明、突出，该使人爱的未能使人热爱和同情，因此在观众中未能收到预期效果。这个重大的缺点固然有一部分是受“王西厢”的影响所致，但是更主要的还是由于改编者比较着重于技术性的改编工作，（在这方面是有收获的）却较少从掌握原作精神入手，细致而周详地去具体分析这些人物的处境和他们的内心矛盾，这样一来，莺莺和老夫人的性格便变成简单化，张生则陷于轻薄，红娘的地位则大为削弱。因此，改编本对情节的取舍虽较原本为好，而整个剧本看去却仍缺少光彩，缺少以人物性格的鲜明对比所造成的戏剧效果，因而不能给予观众足够的思想上的启发和回味。
    其次，这个戏对古典文学通俗化虽已做了一些工作，但还做得不够。在语言上留着不少毛病。改编者在不少地方采用了“王西厢”的原句，使一般观众颇难理解它的意义；有些地方改编者似乎是为了适合越剧唱词的形式，还对原句作了不适当的割裂，例如同一场莺莺原唱“想嫦娥西没东升有谁共”，改本去了“有谁共”三字，便不很贴切莺莺的心情；有些地方原来是主角很重要的唱词，如“琴心”莺莺原唱“绵搭絮”：“怎得人来信息通，便道十二巫峰，也有高唐来梦中”，现改为幕外合唱“怎得人来信息通，只有高唐来梦中”，也较原作大为逊色。总之，戏剧这一形式是在舞台上和观众见面的，把已经衰亡的杂剧改为演给现代人看的越剧时，叫古代人说现代俗语固然不对，但过多的采用古人口语也是不大适当的。保持原作的神韵，应从根本上来解决这个问题，——加强主题和人物性格的描写，而不应从技术上采摘原著的语言入手。现在把几百年前剧曲中的口语不加融化的翻译或搬用进越剧里去，自然会使观众感到文人气味太重，甚至于听不懂的。
    改编古典名剧，这是一件繁重复杂的工作。在这一方面，我们的经验还不够丰富。我们还应从如何保持并发挥原著的积极意义这一方面多加努力。多多从主题的发挥，人物性格的深入分析，从剧情安排的妥切合理着手。我们改编“西厢记”是给现代人看的，我们的“西厢记”内容还不应停留在“王西厢”的思想高度。只要是不超过历史条件所许可的范围，以现实主义的创作方法，在原作的基础上把“西厢记”的内容提高一步，使这个故事更动人、更为人喜爱，这是今天的戏剧家的责任。
