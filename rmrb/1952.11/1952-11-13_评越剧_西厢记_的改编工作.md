    Critique of the Adaptation of Yue Opera "Romance of the West Chamber"
    Dai Fan
    The Yue Opera troupe affiliated with the Cultural Department of the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission achieved certain successes in the adaptation work of the Yue Opera "Romance of the West Chamber" performed at the National Opera Observation and Performance Conference. In their work of popularizing this classic masterpiece, they adopted a relatively serious attitude, based on Wang Shifu's original work, with Zhang Sheng and Yingying as the protagonists, changing the treatment of making Hongniang the protagonist, and no longer having Hongniang alone mediate in the matter, which put the protagonists in a passive position. This is in line with the theme of the original story of "Romance of the West Chamber".
    The Yue Opera "Romance of the West Chamber" develops the story up to "Crying at the Banquet". This is a relatively clean treatment. According to legend, Wang Shifu died from exhaustion when he wrote the beginning of the "Long Pavilion" scene of "Romance of the West Chamber," "Azure sky, yellow flowers earth..." Although this is not entirely credible, from this legend, we can vaguely see the attitude of predecessors towards the ending of "Romance of the West Chamber." They were very dissatisfied with the plot after "Long Pavilion." The ending of "Wang West Chamber" is "Startled Dream," using a dream to replace reunion, which was a beautiful imagination in Wang Shifu's time, but today it seems a bit too bleak. In addition, if Yingying were treated as eloping, it would not be very likely in terms of reasoning. Although Yingying and Zhang Sheng have a certain anti-feudal spirit, due to their class conditions, character, and the era and position they were in, their combativeness could not be highly intense. If their combativeness were very strong, Zhang Sheng should have argued on principle when Madam went back on her word, and Yingying should have stood up bravely and reasoned with her mother at the latest after "Interrogation of Hongniang," instead of waiting until after "Crying at the Banquet" to secretly escape with her mother in the middle of the night. Therefore, the method adopted by the adapters of Yue Opera "Romance of the West Chamber," appropriately strengthening Yingying's resistance and ending the plot at the Long Pavilion farewell, leaving Yingying's ending for the audience to judge, does not harm the theme and integrity of the story.
    The adapters put some effort into the handling of the scenes. For example, they combined the original "Startled Beauty" and "Borrowing the Chamber" into one scene, and omitted the clear scene of Huiming sending the challenge, making the whole play more concise. On the other hand, the adapters also removed the nonsense and erotic parts of the original work, performing "Disturbing the Study" up to Zhang Sheng going to the study, eliminating the appearance of the monks and the ugly scene of holding a grand Taoist ceremony for a dead feudal noble (Cui Xiangguo), and also removing the vulgar gimmicks of the monks winking at a woman in the Buddhist hall. "Responding to the Letter" is performed up to Yingying entering the room, deleting the erotic parts. Doing so does not harm the original plot, but makes the plot more compact and clean.
    In order to popularize classical works while still maintaining the essence of the original, the adapters have also made achievements in some aspects. For example, before "Responding to the Letter," the original only had half a set of Ci poetry, "Xian LÃ¼" and "Dian Jiang Chun," sung by Zhang Sheng. Now, these seven poems have been changed into actions, lyrics, and monologues, using only three or four hundred words, while still expressing the spirit of the original, vividly portraying Zhang Sheng's face, and making the audience understand his anxious mood of waiting for his lover.
    From the above examples, it seems that the Yue Opera "Romance of the West Chamber" can basically grasp the spirit of the original in the treatment of some plots, and has taken a step forward on the basis of not damaging the original, which is an achievement that should be affirmed. However, judging from the performance effect, the Yue Opera "Romance of the West Chamber" is not very able to arouse emotional resonance in the audience, and the whole play seems a bit bland and even makes people feel dull.
    What is the reason for this?
    In addition to the shortcomings of the director and actors in grasping the roles, the main reason is that the adapters have not fully grasped and developed the thematic spirit of "Romance of the West Chamber," and there are still many shortcomings in the handling of the characters. The character colors are not distinct enough, the personalities are not prominent enough, and the impression on the audience is certainly not very profound.
    As for the female protagonist Yingying, she is loved by the audience because she has the courage to pursue a happy life, regardless of the class differences in feudal society, to sympathize with and fall in love with Zhang Sheng, a wandering scholar. Her kind character can touch the hearts of the audience. Wang Shifu, in the first half of "Temple Alert" and the two scenes of "Qin Xin" and "Reneging on the Marriage," delicately portrayed the feelings of this Xiangguo's daughter pitying Zhang Sheng everywhere, making the audience feel her deep affection. However, the adapters in the play did not portray Yingying's moving character more vividly. On the contrary, by stiffly changing the songs originally sung by Yingying alone into duets or group songs, they diluted the character's color. For example, in "Reneging on the Marriage," the original lyrics were all sung by Yingying. Singing Zhang Sheng's words from Yingying's mouth, "You are still worried now, what will you do later!" These places depict the passion and kindness of this young lady, but in the Yue Opera, these lyrics are changed to Zhang Sheng's self-narration: "It is still okay to be worried now, what will you do later." Such a change, while basically retaining the original words, weakens Yingying's character. In addition, appropriately strengthening Yingying's resistance within the limits allowed by the conditions at the time is also possible. Although the adapters have done some work on this, they have not achieved good results. Taking "Responding to the Letter" as an example, although Yingying sings "Mother! Even if you have iron walls and copper walls, I will spread my wings and fly," before deciding to send the letter a second time, such "aphorisms" have not moved the audience. This is because although the adapters have strengthened Yingying's rebellious words, they have not written why she would produce this rebelliousness, and have not deeply expressed the contradictory process of love overcoming feudal traditional concepts in Yingying's heart, so such rebelliousness is like being unrooted and therefore unmoving. In the last scene of the script, "Crying at the Banquet," according to the development of Yingying's character, this is the time for her to boldly express her attitude towards the feudal system, but what we hear is mostly Yingying's sad farewell words (these words are of course necessary), and there are very few words strongly expressing how dissatisfied she is with her mother's unreasonable decision, making this protagonist still appear quite weak in her last appearance. The audience cannot find her passion and kindness in Yingying, as well as her certain dissatisfaction with the feudal system, which is the basic reason why this character cannot move people.
    The handling of Zhang Sheng's character is also not complete enough. The adapters seem to be very eager to focus on depicting Zhang Sheng's boldness and enthusiasm, so on the one hand, they use Zhang Sheng's lyrics to depict his character, for example, in the scene of "Touring the Temple," when he sees Yingying going back, he actually sings the sentence "My heart itches and my bones ache," (Note: The three words "bones ache" seem to have evolved from the original "I understand the bone-penetrating love sickness," which is a bit too much); on the other hand, they also use Zhang Sheng's actions to show his infatuation, for example, in the same scene, after singing "How can I bear her turning her eyes away when she leaves," Zhang Sheng is also asked to "simulate Yingying's footsteps" (this is not in "Wang West Chamber"); on the other hand, the adapters also use the mouths of other characters in the play to describe Zhang Sheng's crazy appearance, for example, arranging for the qintong to appear before "Disturbing the Study," mocking Zhang Sheng "I see that you are not worshipping the Buddha, ah! It's like worshipping the Water Moon Guanyin," (this is also not in "Wang West Chamber"); of course, we are opposed to the adaptation work of adhering to the plot and original words of "Wang West Chamber," but the result of this treatment can easily make the audience misunderstand that Zhang Sheng is a frivolous young man, and it is difficult to sympathize with this character. Although Zhang Sheng is a relatively bold character, his position in that society is relatively low, he has also read some so-called "books of sages," and he is in a state of "drifting in the rivers and lakes," and the other party he encounters is the daughter of a Xiangguo. Under these conditions, if he is treated like a playboy, it violates the identity of the male protagonist arranged by the theme of the play (expressing the anti-feudal spirit through a pair of men and women with "different levels").
    The Yue Opera "Romance of the West Chamber" also treats the character of the Old Madam in a way that is not very reasonable. The Old Madam is not Yingying's stepmother, and this widow should take extra care of her only daughter. However, due to her strong feudal concepts (unwilling to marry a commoner daughter, especially an outsider like Zhang Sheng), this love for her daughter is completely misguided. Writing out the contradictory process of her feudal thoughts overriding her love for her daughter, to the point of disregarding her daughter's happiness and life, can expose the cruelty and evil of feudal society by strengthening her feudal nature. Admittedly, this point was not done well in "Wang West Chamber," but in the original, the first scene also writes that the Old Madam is very considerate of her daughter, and asks Hongniang to accompany her to the courtyard to relax; when Zhang Junrui is ill, she also asks Hongniang to "ask the doctor what medicine to prescribe, what is the disease, and what is the pulse like?" (Now they are all changed to dark scenes, and Yingying briefly mentions them, making people not impressed.) Writing this way makes it easier to see the true face of this Old Madam. In the Yue Opera "Romance of the West Chamber," the impression the Old Madam gives is consistently an old woman who is bent on breaking up her daughter's free marriage, who is fierce and almost unreasonable. This conceptualized and stereotyped character will not attract much attention from the audience. At most, it can only make the audience hate the Old Madam alone, and cannot make people rise to hate the irrational social system.
    In Peking Opera and some local operas, it is certainly not the most appropriate to treat Hongniang as the main character of "Romance of the West Chamber." The adapters of Yue Opera "Romance of the West Chamber" seem to be very aware of this, which is of course good; but the adapters have excessively weakened Hongniang's role, which makes it difficult to satisfy the audience. The complete "Romance of the West Chamber" has disappeared from the stage for many years, while "Hongniang" is still popular in various operas. This is of course because the old version of "Hongniang" has some erotic elements that can cater to the low-level tastes of the backward audience in the semi-feudal and semi-colonial society of the past; but it is undeniable that, after years of creation and accumulation on the stage, Hongniang has become a very distinct image, and her enthusiasm, boldness, and sense of justice are the main reasons why the audience loves her. However, in the Yue Opera "Romance of the West Chamber," her status is degraded even lower than in "Wang West Chamber." In "Wang West Chamber," several scenes such as "Previous Visit," "Disturbing the Letter," and "Later Visit" are all plays mainly about Hongniang, vividly showing Hongniang's role. Taking "Previous Visit" as an example, when Hongniang did not knock on the door and enter Zhang Sheng's room, in "Wang West Chamber," Hongniang first sings six songs from "Dian Jiang Chun" to "Yuan He Ling," which express Hongniang's sympathy for the love between Cui and Zhang; but the adapters have simplified the six songs into ten sentences of seven words each, and five of them seem to be mocking Zhang Sheng for "sitting upright with his clothes on" and "being crazy." For the sentences in the original "...lonely mood, no one to serve, astringent breath, gradually weakening voice, yellow and thin face, Zhang Sheng! If you don't die of illness, you should be bored to death." ("Village Drum"), which can express Hongniang's sympathy (sense of justice), they have been removed. Treating Hongniang like this is obviously not appropriate, because Hongniang played a big role in Cui and Zhang's love. At the same time, giving Hongniang the position she deserves, writing out her rich emotions and her good intentions, can also enrich the flesh and blood of the adaptation of "Romance of the West Chamber" and allow the audience to experience more of the people's nature in the play.
    In general, the character colors of the Yue Opera "Romance of the West Chamber" are not distinct and prominent enough, and it has failed to make people love and sympathize with those who should be loved, so it has failed to achieve the expected effect among the audience. This major shortcoming is of course partly due to the influence of "Wang West Chamber," but the main reason is that the adapters paid more attention to technical adaptation work (in this respect, there are gains), but less started from grasping the spirit of the original and carefully and thoroughly analyzed the situation of these characters and their inner contradictions. As a result, the personalities of Yingying and the Old Madam became simplified, Zhang Sheng fell into frivolity, and Hongniang's position was greatly weakened. Therefore, although the adaptation's selection of plots is better than the original, the entire script still lacks brilliance, lacks the dramatic effect created by the distinct contrast of character personalities, and therefore cannot give the audience enough ideological inspiration and aftertaste.
    Secondly, although this play has done some work in popularizing classical literature, it has not done enough. There are many problems in the language. In many places, the adapters have adopted the original sentences of "Wang West Chamber," making it quite difficult for the general audience to understand its meaning; in some places, the adapters seem to have inappropriately divided the original sentences in order to suit the form of Yue Opera lyrics. For example, in the same scene, Yingying originally sang "I think of Chang'e in the west, there is no one to share when the east rises," and the adaptation removes the three words "there is no one to share," which is not very appropriate to Yingying's mood; some places originally had very important lyrics for the protagonist, such as Yingying's original song "Mian Da Xu" in "Qin Xin": "How can I get someone to send a message, even if there are twelve Witches Peaks, there will be a dream in Gao Tang," which is now changed to a chorus outside the curtain "How can I get someone to send a message, only a dream in Gao Tang," which is also far inferior to the original. In short, the form of drama is to meet the audience on the stage. When changing the already declining Zaju into Yue Opera for modern people to watch, it is certainly not right to ask the ancients to speak modern slang, but it is also not very appropriate to use too much ancient spoken language. Maintaining the essence of the original should be solved from the root - strengthening the description of the theme and character personalities, and not starting from the technical extraction of the original language. Now, translating or using the spoken language in the opera hundreds of years ago into Yue Opera without melting it will naturally make the audience feel too literary and even unable to understand it.
    Adapting classical masterpieces is a heavy and complex task. In this regard, our experience is not rich enough. We should work harder on how to maintain and develop the positive significance of the original. Focus more on the development of the theme, the in-depth analysis of character personalities, and the proper and rational arrangement of the plot. We are adapting "Romance of the West Chamber" for modern people to watch, and the content of our "Romance of the West Chamber" should not remain at the ideological height of "Wang West Chamber." As long as it does not exceed the scope permitted by historical conditions, it is the responsibility of today's dramatists to improve the content of "Romance of the West Chamber" on the basis of the original with a realistic creative method, making this story more moving and more loved.
