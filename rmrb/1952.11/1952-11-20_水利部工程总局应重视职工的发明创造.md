    The General Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Water Resources Should Value the Inventions and Creations of Employees
    To the Editor: The General Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Water Resources does not pay enough attention to the inventions and creations of employees at its Beijing Repair Factory. Since the launch of the patriotic production increase and economy drive in July, all employees of this repair factory have been actively seeking innovations, tapping potential, and proposing rationalization suggestions, resulting in significant increases in production and savings for the country. Huang Xiang, the head of the manufacturing team, has successively designed and trial-manufactured high-pressure grouting pumps and high-pressure water pumps, both of which are urgently needed for water conservancy construction projects. The cost of each high-pressure grouting pump trial-manufactured by Huang Xiang is only 20 million yuan, which is equivalent to one-eighth of the price of air-compressor grouting pumps with roughly the same effectiveness manufactured in Shanghai. The pressure of the high-pressure water pump he designed and trial-manufactured reached 800 pounds. According to the Beijing Equipment Company, this type of high-pressure water pump is worth about 45 million yuan per unit, while Huang Xiang's only costs 20 million yuan per unit to manufacture. The repair factory has now manufactured ten high-pressure grouting pumps and seven high-pressure water pumps, resulting in a significant increase in production and savings for the country.
    In order to boost employee enthusiasm and consolidate existing production achievements, the factory leadership formulated a reward method for rationalization proposals in June and submitted it to the General Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Water Resources for review. After one revision and several discussions, more than five months have passed, and the issue has not yet been resolved. We believe that this practice of not resolving problems and simply procrastinating by the General Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Water Resources is wrong.

### 水利部工程总局应重视职工的发明创造

    水利部工程总局应重视职工的发明创造
    编辑同志：水利部工程总局对所属北京修配厂职工的发明创造很不重视。这个修配厂自七月份开展爱国增产节约竞赛运动，全体职工积极找窍门、挖潜力、提合理化建议，给国家增产节约了大量财富。这个厂的制造组组长黄祥，先后设计试造了高压灌浆泵和高压水泵；这都是水利建筑工程上急迫需要的机械。黄祥试造的高压灌浆泵每部成本只两千万元，相当上海制造的效能大体相同的空气压缩灌浆泵价格的八分之一。他设计试造的高压水泵的压力达到八百磅，据北京器财公司谈，这种高压水泵每台约值四千五百万元，而黄祥制的每台只用成本费两千万元。现在修配厂已制造出十台高压灌浆泵和七台高压水泵，给国家增产节约了很大一笔财富。
    该厂领导方面为了提高职工生产热情，巩固已有生产成绩，在六月份制订了一个关于合理化建议奖励办法，呈报水利部工程总局审核，这中间经过一次修订，和几次商谈，到现在已有五个多月，也没有得到解决。我们认为水利部工程总局，这种不解决问题，一味拖延的作法是不对的。
