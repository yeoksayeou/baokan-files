Xinhua News Agency: The "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities are being carried out enthusiastically in ethnic minority regions across the country. People of all ethnic groups are participating in this activity to consolidate the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet nations with joyful hearts.

    In the Northwest, the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities in Di Hua City, Xinjiang Province, have entered a stage of widespread and in-depth development. People in four districts of Di Hua have generally received education on Sino-Soviet friendship. Reading groups in various streets and alleys focused on explaining the history of Sino-Soviet friendship and the vivid stories of Soviet experts helping China's construction, as reported in the newspapers, during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." Soviet film exhibitions and exhibitions of Soviet pictures, books, and periodicals have also aroused great interest among people of all ethnic groups in Di Hua City. According to incomplete statistics, by the 19th, the number of viewers of Soviet film exhibitions in Di Hua City had reached more than 70,000. Kazakh people from Nanshan, eighty miles away from Di Hua, also braved the cold to come to the city to watch. Many porters who came to Di Hua from the Turpan Basin rushed to the cinema to buy tickets after unloading their burdens. After receiving education on Sino-Soviet friendship, people of all ethnic groups in Di Hua City have requested to join the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. In the third district, more than 200 residents of Uyghur, Kazakh, Han, Hui, Tatar, and Uzbek ethnicities voluntarily went to the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association to apply for membership. The sixth district, which originally had more than 100 members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, has now grown to more than 400 members, and recently established the district's Sino-Soviet Friendship Association organization. In addition, according to statistics from only six places, including Yining City and Kashgar City in Xinjiang Province, Linxia and Pingliang Cities in Gansu Province, Zhuoni Tibetan Autonomous Region People's Government seat in Zhuoni, and Suonanba, the seat of the Dongxiang Autonomous Region People's Government, more than 100,000 people of various ethnic groups such as Hui, Tibetan, and Uyghur held grand celebrations during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." Various localities organized propaganda teams, held picture exhibitions and report meetings, and performed songs and dances with the theme of Sino-Soviet friendship to carry out propaganda.

    In the Southwest, in the areas where Dai and Benren ethnic groups live in Baoshan Special District, Yunnan Province, the areas where Miao and Hui ethnic groups live in Guizhou, and the Tibetan Autonomous Region in Xikang, people of all ethnic groups publicized Sino-Soviet friendship in the streets and markets with singing and dancing all day long, as if celebrating a grand festival. The propaganda parade held by people of all ethnic groups in Kangding City, the capital of the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region, was attended by a hundred-person string band and a hundred-person waist drum team organized by the Tibetan people, as well as a band jointly organized by various Lama temples. Mojiang County in southern Yunnan Province, where ethnic minorities account for 80% of the total population, held a meeting of more than 5,000 people on November 7, and performed songs and dances of various ethnic groups in the evening to celebrate Sino-Soviet friendship. The "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities in ethnic minority areas in the Southwest have gradually penetrated into remote rural areas. Eight mobile projection teams in Guizhou Province went deep into the villages of eight counties including Huishui and Zhenning to show films, with an audience of 320,000 people. Teachers and students of ethnic schools also joined the propaganda activities of "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." Students of various ethnic groups from Guiyang Nationalities College, Kangding Nationalities School, Baoshan District Nationalities College, and Nationalities Cadre Training Class used their spare time to go deep into various residential areas and rural areas to conduct propaganda using their own ethnic languages, scripts, and dances. Students from the Nationalities College in Baoshan Special District also translated documents such as "Introduction to the October Revolution" and "Sino-Soviet Friendship is a Bastion of World Peace" into Dai, Shantaotzu and Lisu and sent them to their hometowns to read. Sino-Soviet Friendship Association organizations in ethnic minority areas in Yunnan, Guizhou, and Xikang have flourished, and many areas that did not have Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in the past have now established them. More than 5,000 people of Tibetan, Hui and other ethnic groups in Baoshan Special District in Yunnan Province, Lushun Miao Autonomous Region in Guizhou Province, and Xikang Province have joined the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.

    In the Northeast, before the start of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," all counties and districts under the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture generally organized "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" preparatory committees to specifically lead the propaganda activities during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." Jin Shilong, a famous Korean labor model who had visited the Soviet Union, set off to report his impressions of his visit to the Soviet Union to Korean farmers throughout the region after the start of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," which was extremely popular with the audience. Korean people are very fond of Soviet films. The Yanji City Cinema screens as many as nine shows a day, and every show is full, with more than 50,000 viewers in ten days. Jiang Junyu, a farmer from the eighth district of Yanji County, said after watching "Soviet Uzbekistan": "In the past, I always wanted to move to the city because I thought there was no future in the mountains. Today, after watching this film, I know that as long as we learn from the Soviet Union, we can definitely build our mountain villages as good as the Soviet mountain areas!"

    In Central South, the counties in Yishan Special District of Guangxi Province, which are mainly inhabited by the Zhuang people, generally established "Sino-Soviet Friendship Rooms" during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." More than 40,000 people of Zhuang, Yao, Han, and other ethnic groups participated in the celebration meeting in Du'an County, Binyang Special District. Teng Wenjing, a farmer representative who visited the Soviet Union, and Jiang Zaiqiu, an agricultural labor model, gave reports on their impressions of visiting the Soviet Union in Zhuang areas in Yongning and Baise. In Binyang and Hengxian alone, 20,000 farmers of all ethnic groups listened to the reports. As early as the beginning of this month, twelve film work teams from the Guangxi Provincial People's Government went to the areas inhabited by ethnic minorities and areas where ethnic minorities live together in Dayao Mountain, Miao Mountain, Fangcheng, Sanjiang, and Longsheng to show films. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in the Central South region also sent a film team to Dayao Mountain to cooperate in showing films. The ethnic minorities in Dayao Mountain sent representatives to Yishan, more than a hundred miles away, to greet the arrival of the provincial film team.

    [Xinhua News Agency] A nationwide upsurge in learning from advanced Soviet experiences has formed among railway employees across the country. Since the beginning of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," railway bureaus in various regions have used telephone conferences, symposiums, and demonstration performances to promote advanced Soviet experiences and introduce methods for learning from advanced Soviet experiences. The Suihua Branch of the Qiqihar Railway Administration has been holding two-hour professional telephone conferences every day since November 11, during which its subordinate sections mutually introduce and learn the methods of promoting advanced Soviet experiences. The Suihua Locomotive Depot introduced at the meeting the experience of the Chen Zhizhong Locomotive Group No. 975 learning the Zheng Xikun driving method demonstration performance and prepared to introduce the Sudennikov integrated shunting method and the Guo Chunlin track maintenance method. The Jiang'an Machine Factory of the Hankou Branch of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration held a symposium for employees, where employees who had achieved success in learning from advanced Soviet experiences spoke about their experiences in overcoming conservative ideas and learning from advanced Soviet experiences. The Xi'an Branch of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration recently began to systematically and with leadership promote 33 advanced Soviet experiences, including the "Tight Operation Chart," the Sudennikov integrated shunting method, and the Lunin-style locomotive maintenance method, to improve work efficiency and strive to load 27% more freight cars in November than in October.

    Some departments have also established special institutions to strengthen leadership over the movement to promote advanced Soviet experiences. The Huangguatun Railway Factory organized groups for promoting advanced Soviet experiences in various workshops to lead the promotion of advanced Soviet experiences in various workshops. The Jinan Railway Factory established a committee for promoting advanced Soviet experiences and formulated a work plan. The Manzhouli Branch of the Shenyang Railway Administration recently established a training class for learning from advanced Soviet experiences, and some railway bureaus have also sent propaganda teams and film teams to conduct propaganda along the railway lines.
