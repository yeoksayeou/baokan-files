Xinhua News Agency, November 19th Dispatch from Bucharest, Romanian News Agency: The "Spark" newspaper published an article by the well-known "Daily Worker" reporter in London, Pike, on the increasingly fierce contradictions between the US and Britain in their struggle for markets. The author wrote: Many changes have taken place in Britain's overseas markets and raw material supply areas, and these changes, by their very nature, are enough to alarm British capitalists.

	In India, American institutions are extracting raw materials at low prices and making huge profits, while British imperialism is rapidly losing its foothold. There are now seventy-seven American experts who have gone to India under the Point Four Program, in addition to more than one hundred other experts. These experts are mainly dedicated to turning India into a sales market for American goods and hindering the development of Indian industry. Japan has now become not only the largest exporter of textiles, but also a strong competitor to Britain in heavy industry. Britain used to rely on Australia and Canada, but now these two countries are showing unhappiness with the difficulties of the old lion, Britain.

	The article continued: The United States not only prohibits Britain from engaging in trade relations with the socialist camp, but also consolidates Britain's main competitors in the world market, thereby weakening Britain day by day. The increasing consolidation of West German monopoly capital has promoted a new development, which may bring disastrous economic consequences to Britain. The power of the British lion in the world market is shrinking day by day, while the American imperialist tiger is baring its fangs and showing its power.

	The article concluded: Britain's growing dissatisfaction with the United States is a factor that is secretly driving British capitalism to fight against the United States. In Britain, as in any other capitalist country, defending national independence and democracy and opposing the most aggressive American imperialism has become a major issue. There are millions of angry workers who oppose American aggressors, as well as some of their own bourgeoisie and some of their own capitalists who are threatened by American imperialist actions. This situation is contributing to the increasing intensification of US-British contradictions.
	
Xinhua News Agency Dispatch from Moscow, November 5th: "Pravda" commentator Malinin wrote an article discussing the deepening contradictions between the United States and Britain. He wrote: The British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference scheduled for the end of this month has aroused strong suspicion and unease in Washington.

	Malinin continued: It should be taken into account that just a few days ago, American representatives were subjected to extraordinary opposition from some of its North Atlantic group partners at the meeting of so-called "General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Signatories" in Geneva.

	The US State Department had to consider these Geneva "accidents" as a harbinger of more serious London "accidents," especially as the struggle between the United States and its partners for markets and raw material supply resources is becoming increasingly acute. It is well known that many of the United States' partners are reducing the amount of goods they purchase from the dollar area. At the same time, behind the scenes of the North Atlantic Group, quarrels have begun over the military budget for the next fiscal year.

	In this situation, the United States decided to seize the opportunity to take another step forward and force its partners to accept a more thorough plan: to supplement the military apparatus of the North Atlantic Group system with corresponding economic institutions. This plan was put forward by the so-called Mutual Security Agency in the form of a special "Green Paper."

	The "Green Paper" suggests the establishment of a "North Atlantic Reserve System," which in effect would make the US dollar the official and practical "currency of currencies." The authors of the "Green Paper" openly stated that apart from the US dollar, it is impossible for national currencies to exist independently in the capitalist world. To add a layer of sugar to this bitter pill, they invented a plan to organize a so-called "Currency Stabilization Fund," ostensibly to further "aid" the United States' Western European satellite countries. The real masters of the fund, of course, are the American monopoly capitalists.

	The new tricks devised by the United States do not stop there. The United States also wants to organize a "North Atlantic Commodity Committee" - a world raw material cartel controlled by the United States - and a "North Atlantic Economic Committee" to control "trade and other policies that affect monetary relations."

	From this it can be seen that the purpose of the American billionaires is to completely plunder the currencies, raw material resources, and markets of their North Atlantic partners.

	These aggressive plans put forward in the "Green Paper" foreshadow an increase in pressure from the gold dollar imperialism on its satellite countries, which will inevitably lead to a further intensification of contradictions in the imperialist camp.

### 美英帝国主义争夺市场斗争尖锐

    美英帝国主义争夺市场斗争尖锐   
    【新华社十九日讯】据罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特讯：“火花报”刊载伦敦《工人日报》著名记者派克写的一篇关于美英争夺市场的矛盾日趋剧烈的论文。作者写道：英国海外市场和原料供应地区发生了许多变化，这些变化，就其性质而言，都足以使英国资本家感到惊慌。
    在印度，美国的机构以低廉价格榨取原料，获得巨额利润，而英帝国主义则迅速地失去立足点。现在印度有七十七名根据第四点计划去到印度的美国专家，此外还有一百多个其他的专家。这些专家们主要是致力于把印度变为美国商品的销售地，阻碍印度工业的发展。日本现在不仅成为最大的一个纺织品出口国，而且也变成了英国在重工业方面的强大竞争者。英国在过去是一直求助于澳大利亚和加拿大的，但是现在这两国对英国这只老大狮子的困难却表示出不开心的态度。
    论文继续说：美国不仅禁止英国与社会主义阵营发生贸易关系，而且使英国的主要竞争者在世界市场上巩固起来，从而使英国日益削弱。西德垄断资本的日趋巩固促成了一种新的发展，这种发展的结果可能给英国带来灾难性的经济后果。英国这只狮子在世界市场上的势力一天天地缩小，而美帝国主义这只老虎却在张牙舞爪，大显威风。
    论文最后写道：英国对美国日益增长的不满情绪便是暗暗地驱使英国资本主义与美国斗争的一个因素。在英国，正像在其他任何资本主义国家一样，保卫民族独立和民主、反对最富于侵略性的美帝国主义，已经成为一个重大问题。反对美国侵略者的有数百万愤怒的工人，也有他们本国的一部分资产阶级和本国的一部分受到美帝国主义行动威胁的资本家。这种情况促使美英矛盾日趋尖锐化。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科五日讯：“真理报”评论家马里宁撰文论述美国与英国之间日益加深的矛盾。他写道：定于本月底举行的英国联邦总理会议，已经使华盛顿方面产生了强烈的猜疑和不安。
    马里宁继续写道：应该考虑到，仅仅在几天以前，美国的代表们在日内瓦举行的所谓“关税贸易总协定签字国”会议上，曾遭到了它的某些北大西洋集团伙伴的异乎寻常的反对。
    美国国务院不得不认为这些日内瓦的“意外事件”是更为严重的伦敦“意外事件”的一种预兆，尤其是因为目前美国和它的伙伴们为了争夺市场和原料供应资源而进行的斗争越来越尖锐。大家知道，美国的许多伙伴们都在削减它们向美元地区购买货物的数量。同时，在北大西洋集团幕后，关于下一个财政年度的军事预算已经开始发生争吵。
    在这种情况下，美国决定抓紧机会再向前挺进一步，强迫它的伙伴们接受一个更彻底的计划，即是：用相当的经济机构来补充北大西洋集团的军事机构体系。这个计划是由所谓共同安全署以一个特别的“绿皮书”的形式提出来的。
    这个“绿皮书”建议成立“北大西洋储备体制”，实际上就是要把美元作为正式的、实际的“货币之货币”。“绿皮书”的作者公然说：除了美元以外，各国货币是不可能在资本主义世界里独立存在的。为了给这粒苦丸加上一层糖衣，他们发明了组织所谓“货币稳定基金”的计划，表面上说是为了进一步“援助”美国的西欧卫星国家。基金的真正主人当然是美国的垄断资本家。
    美国所想出的新花样并不至此为止。美国还要组织一个“北大西洋商品委员会”——一种由美国控制的世界原料卡特尔——和一个“北大西洋经济委员会”，以控制“贸易和其它各种影响货币关系的政策”。
    由此可知，美国的亿万富翁们的目的就是要完全掠夺北大西洋伙伴们的货币、原料资源和市场。
    “绿皮书”内所提出的这些侵略计划，预示金元帝国主义将对它的卫星国家增加压力，这必然不可避免地将使帝国主义阵营的矛盾更加增剧。
