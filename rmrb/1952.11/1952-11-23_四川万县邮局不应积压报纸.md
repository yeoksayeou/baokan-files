    Wanxian Post Office in Sichuan Should Not Hold Up Newspapers
    Comrade Editor: The Wanxian Post and Telecommunications Bureau in Sichuan has a very serious problem with holding up newspapers during their transport. Although the reader Yang Zhao raised criticisms in the "Reader's Letters" column of the Chongqing Xinhua Daily on October 11th, there has been no improvement. The People's Daily and Guangming Daily from October 6th to 13th, a total of eight days, were once again forwarded to Qu County and Yingshan County, etc. Therefore, many readers are very dissatisfied. They say: "If the newspapers don't come, they don't come, but when they do come, it's a big pile, as if we are reading historical documents." This unserious work style of the Wanxian Post Office not only directly hinders the distribution of newspapers, causing undue losses to the newspapers' role in propaganda and education, but also makes readers feel very inconvenient. We believe that this phenomenon should be corrected in a timely manner.

    Editor's Note: According to readers' letters received by this newspaper and the results of investigations by our reporters, the phenomenon of untimely newspaper distribution is most common and serious in some areas, especially in some post offices in the Southwest. Please have the Central Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications conduct an inspection and formulate specific improvement measures.

    四川万县邮局不应积压报纸
    编辑同志：四川万县邮电局在转运报纸的工作上，积压现象很严重。虽经读者杨钊在十月十一日重庆新华日报读者来信栏提出批评，但仍未改进。十月六日至十三日共八天的人民日报、光明日报又是一次转给渠县和营山等县。因此，不少读者很不满意，他们说：报纸不来就不来，一来就是一大堆，好像看历史文件一样。万县邮局这种不严肃的工作作风不仅直接阻碍了报纸的发行，使报纸在宣传教育作用上受到了不应有的损失，同时也使读者感到很不方便。我们认为这种现象应当及时纠正。
    张文林    李致祥
    编者按：据本报所收到的读者来信及本报派人调查的结果，报纸发行不及时的现象，在某些地区、特别是西南某些邮局最为普遍和严重。请中央邮电部进行一次检查；并订出具体的改进办法。
