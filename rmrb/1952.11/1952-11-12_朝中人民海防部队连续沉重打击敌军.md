Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 10th. Our front-line reporter reports on the victorious battles on the northern Korean naval defense line, saying:

	Along the long and winding naval defense line in northern Korea, powerful Korean-Chinese People's Naval Defense Forces guard every point. Countless large naval guns point towards the undulating sea, constantly inflicting heavy blows on enemy ships that intrude into the coastal waters. One morning, an enemy speedboat took advantage of the early morning mist to sail into the coastal waters and shell the shore. Our naval defense forces only returned nine shots, and this enemy boat sank in the sea 10,000 meters from the shore. On another occasion, in pouring rain, an enemy "mixed fleet" consisting of twenty-three ships came to invade the naval defense line, frantically bombarding the shore. The Korean People's Army Li Yong-meng artillery unit, guarding this section of the coast, returned fire fiercely. As a result of the artillery battle, three enemy destroyers were sunk and two were damaged. Lee Sung-nam, a holder of the Second Class Warrior Honor Medal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, once sank an enemy boat with a single shell in a certain battle. Under the attack of our naval defense artillery, even the enemy battleship "Wisconsin" was wounded.

	Enemy planes bombed the northern Korean naval defense line day and night, attempting to destroy our naval defense artillery. However, the American aerial bandits suffered no less than their navy. The anti-aircraft gunners of the naval defense forces created many brilliant achievements. One day, more than thirty enemy planes bombed a certain coastline, and as a result, five were shot down and one was damaged by our ground fire. That evening, more than thirty enemy planes came to this place to provoke trouble, and as a result, three more were shot down and two were damaged.

	In order to ensure the security of the rear in northern Korea, the Korean-Chinese People's Naval Defense Forces not only closely guard against enemy agents sneaking ashore but also actively eliminate bandit troops entrenched on small islands near the coast. They carried out continuous cross-sea operations on the west coast and annihilated bandit troops on several islands in northwestern Korea. On the east coast, where enemy ships gather, the heroic Korean-Chinese People's Naval Defense Forces also launched equally heroic attacks. One dark night, a team of warriors boarded a large island outside Wonsan Harbor on wooden boats and, after a fierce battle, wiped out all the more than two hundred enemy troops guarding it.

	In the coastal areas, the indomitable Korean people continue to persevere in production and work, using all their strength to support the war. Although they live under the threat of enemy shells and bombs every day, underground factories are still operating; the peasants send the best grain to the front-line troops; the elderly, women, and children actively repair the roadbeds of highways and railways damaged by enemy planes; and the residents of villages and towns are also organized to stand guard and patrol, checking suspicious pedestrians...

	The coast of northern Korea stands like a Great Wall in the face of the enemy at sea.

    朝中人民海防部队连续沉重打击敌军
    【新华社朝鲜前线十日电】本社前线记者报道朝鲜北部海防线上的胜利战斗说：
    在朝鲜北部漫长而曲折的海防线上，每一处都有强大的朝中人民海防部队守卫着；无数门巨大的海防炮的炮口遥对着波涛起伏的海面，不断地给予侵入近海的敌人舰艇以沉重的打击。一天清晨，敌人的一艘快艇趁着晓雾驶入近海，向岸上打炮。我海防部队只还击了九发炮弹，这艘敌艇就在离岸一万多公尺的海面上沉下去了。另一次，正下着倾盆大雨，敌人以二十三只舰艇组成的“混合舰队”前来进犯海防线，疯狂地向岸上轰击。守卫在这一段海岸上的朝鲜人民军李容梦炮兵部队，用猛烈的炮火还击敌舰。炮战结果，敌军驱逐舰三艘被击沉，两艘被击伤。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国二级战士荣誉勋章获得者李圣南，曾在某次战斗中用一发炮弹击沉了一艘敌艇。在我海防炮火的打击下，甚至敌人的战斗舰“威斯康星”号也被击负伤。
    敌机不分昼夜地向朝鲜北部的海防线进行轰炸，企图毁灭我海防炮兵。但是，美国空中强盗所遭受到的打击并不比他们的海军轻些。海防部队的高射炮手们创造了许多辉煌的战绩。有一天，三十多架敌机轰炸某处海岸，结果被我地面炮火击落五架，击伤一架。这天傍晚，又有三十多架敌机到这个地方来寻衅，结果又被击落三架，击伤两架。
    为保障朝鲜北部后方的安全，朝中人民海防部队不仅严密提防着潜行上岸的敌军特务，并且主动肃清盘踞在海岸附近小岛上的匪军。他们曾在西海岸连续进行渡海作战，歼灭了朝鲜西北部若干海岛上的匪军。在敌舰云集的东海岸，英勇的朝中人民海防部队也同样地英勇出击。在一个黑夜里，一队勇士乘着木船登上元山港外的大岛，经过一场激烈战斗，将守敌二百多名全部消灭。
    在海岸地区，不屈的朝鲜人民仍在那里坚持生产和工作，用一切力量支援战争。虽然他们每天生活在敌人的炮弹和炸弹的威胁下，但地下工厂仍在开工；农民们把最好的粮食送给前线部队；老人、妇女和儿童都积极修筑被敌机炸坏了的公路和铁路的路基；村镇的居民也组织起来站岗放哨，盘查可疑的行人……
    朝鲜北部的海岸正像一道长城一样地屹立在海上敌人的面前。
