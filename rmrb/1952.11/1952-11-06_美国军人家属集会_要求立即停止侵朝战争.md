Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 4th: The New York "Daily Worker" reported on October 27th that two hundred relatives of American soldiers held an emergency meeting in Springfield, Illinois, on October 25th, demanding a ceasefire in Korea to save the lives of their sons and husbands. The meeting was titled "Save Our Sons" and was chaired by Goldesbide, a Black worker from Chicago whose son was captured in Korea.

The representatives came from twenty-seven cities and towns, large and small – from the prairie towns and farms of the Midwest, and from industrial centers such as Chicago and Detroit.

Letters were read at the meeting from many families in Ohio, Kansas City, and other areas who were unable to attend, but who wished to join the call for peace. The letter writers were all those who had suffered from the death of fathers and sons, poverty, and other evils of war.

Mrs. Grigorev, a Black mother whose son had been killed in action, said at the meeting: "We know the cost of this war, it is destroying our sons. We must also think about what impact the war is having on the Korean people... Korean and Chinese mothers love their sons just as we love our sons. I scrub floors and cook for people to send my son to the University of Wisconsin. Now he is dead, my nephew has been injured and crippled, and now they are going to take another nephew away. Women all over the world hope that we American women will take action. After this meeting, we must take action."

The conference passed a resolution calling on the Truman administration and the Democratic and Republican presidential and vice-presidential candidates to order an immediate ceasefire in Korea and resume armistice negotiations.

The meeting also drafted a letter to American prisoners of war in Korea. The letter read: "We have not forgotten your suffering. We want you to know that we want you to return to your homes immediately. We will awaken the conscience of America – we will urge those in high office to immediately implement a ceasefire so that you can all return."

    美国军人家属集会
    要求立即停止侵朝战争
    【新华社布拉格四日电】纽约“工人日报”十月二十七日报道，两百名美军亲属十月二十五日在伊利诺斯州斯普林腓特举行紧急集会，要求在朝鲜停火，以拯救他们的儿子和丈夫的生命。集会定名为“拯救我们的儿子”会议，主席是芝加哥的黑人工人戈德斯比德，他的儿子在朝鲜被俘。
    代表们来自二十七个大小城市——来自中西部的草原城镇和田庄，来自芝加哥和底特律等工业中心。
    会议上宣读了俄亥俄州、堪萨斯城以及其它地区许多家庭的来信，他们不能参加会议，但是他们愿意参加要求和平。来信人都是那些身受父死子亡、贫穷以及战争的其他恶果的人。
    儿子已经阵亡的黑人母亲格里哥雷夫人在会议上说：“我们知道这次战争的代价，它正在毁灭我们的儿子。我们也必须想想战争正给予朝鲜人民什么样的影响……朝鲜和中国母亲爱她们的儿子正如我们爱我们的儿子一样。我擦地板，替人做厨娘才把我的儿子送进了威斯康星州立大学。现在他死了，我的侄子也受了伤成了残废人，而现在，他们又要抢走我的另外一个侄子了。世界各地妇女都希望我们美国妇女有所行动。这次会议以后，我们必须行动起来。”
    大会通过决议，要求杜鲁门政府以及民主党和共和党的正副总统候选人下令立即在朝鲜停火并恢复停战谈判。
    会议还起草了一封致在朝鲜的美军战俘的信。这封信中写道：“我们没有忘记你们的遭遇。我们要你们知道：我们希望你们立刻回到你们自己的地方来。我们将唤起美国的良心——我们将促使官居显职的人立刻实现停火，使你们大家都能回来。”
