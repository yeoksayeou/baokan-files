Editor's Note: The Icelandic delegation to China, invited by the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, has left Beijing on the morning of the 4th to return home. After arriving in Beijing on September 28th and attending the National Day celebrations, the Icelandic delegation visited Bengbu, Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and other places starting on October 6th. They also held several symposiums with Chinese workers, farmers, women workers, youth workers, and literary and art circles in various locations. This is the speech given by Kaldalón, the head of the Icelandic delegation, at the farewell banquet hosted by the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs on the evening of the 3rd.

Dear friends:

The Icelandic delegation has been here for five weeks at your invitation, and we have enjoyed such love and care that it feels like a myth. With the most thoughtful arrangements and the best guides, the delegation traveled 5,600 kilometers in your beautiful and vast land and stayed in some of the major cities. In addition, the delegation had the opportunity to see some wonderful cultural relics with thousands of years of history. At the same time, and most importantly, the delegation was excited to see the amazing transformation that has taken place in the entire national life in the short period after the people became masters of their own country. The delegation's main mission was to see with its own eyes the great prospects that the liberators have pointed out to the working people.

The trip to China has made it clearer to us than ever before that the Chinese people have suffered incredible oppression from feudalism and foreign aggressors. Without understanding this past, it is impossible to correctly assess the nature and greatness of the Chinese revolution. As in any part of the capitalist world, the brilliant Chinese culture was once a privilege enjoyed only by a small ruling class. They lived in palaces, possessed silk, porcelain, and ivory, and owned all the wealth and resources of the country and the beauty that the people had pursued and formed over the centuries. At the same time, hundreds of millions of people lived on the edge of enslavement, hunger, cold, floods, plagues, and death century after century.

Indeed, the time has come when a bugle call has awakened the long-suffering Chinese people. Now this bugle has been sounded, and the Chinese Communist Party under the leadership of Mao Zedong has sounded this bugle. Our trip to China has made us even more admiring and respectful of the unparalleled heroism of the Chinese Communist Party, which has led the Chinese people in their struggle against domestic and foreign reactionaries for thirty years. It was the Chinese Communist Party that ignited in the hearts of the people the passion to fight for liberation from tyranny and filled the entire nation with an admirable moral force after it was freed from the corrupt rule of the Kuomintang.

The Chinese people seem to be inspired by a magical force. The People's Republic of China has only been established for three years. In the four thousand years of history, three years is only a moment. But in these three years, under the leadership of the People's Government, China has gained its honor internationally and in human history. The Icelandic delegation has tried very hard to understand this new world power belonging to the working people. We have seen that prices have stabilized, land has been distributed to farmers, industry is preparing to enter into larger-scale production, and the transportation system has been improved. We have seen the facts of increased production, increased wages, and the elimination of unemployment. We have learned about the Chinese people's struggle to overcome natural disasters—the great water conservancy projects, which on the one hand protect fields and lives from disasters, and on the other hand generate electricity and supply light for the people. We have also seen the Chinese people's struggle to overcome disease and improve health, and so on.

At the same time, a great and extensive cultural and educational movement has been launched among the Chinese people. It can be said that the whole of China is about to become a school, where men and women, young and old, will participate in learning. The peace-loving, persevering, talented, and art-loving Chinese people will no longer toil like beasts of burden all their lives, but will live as a true person, a free person, a person with collectivist ideas, and a peace-loving person. He will now finally get the best knowledge that modern life can provide, and he will combine life and art and move towards an infinitely happy future.

Everything I have mentioned now is just a beginning—but a wonderful beginning that heralds a bright and splendid future. During its stay in China, the Icelandic delegation deeply felt that it was living in a country with endless wealth and a people with unlimited talents. The delegation is fully aware that it came to China at a time when the long history of China is entering the dawn of a new era, and the future of the great Chinese people will be a glorious victory in human history.

We have also noticed the innocent joy of the new people and the enthusiastic singing of the young people who are about to become the new masters of the country, and we have been deeply moved by it. During your National Day celebration on October 1st, we were also swept into the carnival-like, colorful crowd in your beautiful capital. We saw with our own eyes you cheer and pay tribute to your beloved leaders who led you into New China. This was truly a moment of victory parade. And the most remarkable thing on that day was the youth—your future. It was these young people who held high the banners that read "World Peace" that day.

Since we came to China, the two words we have encountered most often are "People" and "Peace." These two words are the main symbols of New China, and in the near future, these two words will become the symbols of victory in every corner of the world. In the face of these two words, all aggressors in the world must surrender and disarm. All those who kill and set fires, all those who are obsessed with the atomic bomb, all those who oppress people and are enemies of peaceful working people, must surrender to "People" and "Peace." Those who believe in collectivism will surely defeat those who are centered on the individual, peace will surely defeat war, and life will surely defeat death!

This truth, these two great symbols of New China, must be conveyed to our people at home when we return. We feel that only by doing so can we, to some extent, repay the brotherly friendship we have gained here.

The Icelandic delegation sincerely thanks the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs for its hospitality. We warmly thank you for your kind and sincere feelings towards us and for all the gifts you have given us. The delegation sincerely hopes that closer ties can be established between our two peoples, ties based on "People" and "Peace." We hope that in the near future, things will develop in such a way that Chinese guests can come to our distant and lovely Iceland—to the new Iceland, the people's democratic Iceland.

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the great Chairman Mao Zedong!

Long live world peace!

    冰岛访华代表团团长凯德隆返国前发表对新中国的观感
    编者按：应中国人民外交学会的邀请来我国访问的冰岛访华代表团一行六人已于四日晨离北京返国。冰岛访华代表团自九月二十八日抵京，参加我国国庆节观礼后，十月六日起曾前往蚌埠、南京、上海、杭州、广州、武汉等各地参观，并曾在各地与我国工人、农民、妇女工作者、青年工作者、文学艺术界人士等举行座谈多次。这是冰岛访华代表团团长凯德隆三日晚在中国人民外交学会欢送宴会上的致词。亲爱的朋友们：
    冰岛访华代表团应你们的邀请来到这里已经有五个星期了，我们在这里享受到对我们的友爱与关心，简直像在一个神话中一样。代表团在最周到的布置和最好的向导的引导下，在你们美丽而广阔的国土中旅行了五千六百公里，并且在一些主要的城市中作了逗留。此外，代表团并且有机会见到了一些美妙的，有着几千年历史发展的文化古迹。同时，也是最重要的，代表团兴奋地看到了在人民成为自己国家的主人之后的短时期中，整个民族生活中所发生的惊人的突变。代表团的主要的使命也就是要亲眼看看解放者向劳动人民所指出的伟大的前景。
    中国之行使我们比以前更加清楚了，中国人民曾受到封建制度和外国侵略者的难以置信的压迫，如果没有了解这个过去的事实，就不可能正确地估价中国革命的性质和它的伟大。像在资本主义世界中的任何地方一样，灿烂的中国文化过去只是少数统治阶级所能享受到的一种特权。他们住在皇宫中，拥有丝绸、瓷器和象牙，拥有整个国家的一切财富资源和人民几世纪来所追求和形成的美。同时，亿万人民一个世纪又一个世纪地生活在被奴役、饥饿、寒冷、水灾、瘟疫和死亡的边缘。
    的确，一声号角唤醒长期忍受着苦难的中国人民的时候来到了。现在这个号角吹响了，在毛泽东领导下的中国共产党吹起了这个号角。由于中国之行，使我们对三十年来领导着中国人民与国内外反动派作斗争的中国共产党的无比英勇，更加感到钦佩与敬仰。是中国共产党在人民心中点燃起了为从暴政下解放出来而斗争的热情，并使整个民族在摆脱了国民党贪污腐化的统治之后，充满着一种可惊羡的道德力量。
    中国人民好像被一种神奇的力量所激发。中华人民共和国成立以来才只有三年。在四千年的历史中，三年只是一个瞬间。但是在这三年中，在人民政府的领导下，中国已经在国际上和人类历史中取得了它的荣誉。冰岛访华代表团极为用心地求得了解这个属于劳动人民的新的世界强国。我们看到物价稳定了，土地已经分给了农民，工业正在准备进入更大规模的生产，运输系统已经得到改善。我们看到了生产的增加，工资的提高和消灭失业现象的事实。我们了解了中国人民战胜自然灾害的斗争——伟大的水利工程，它一方面使田地与生命免于灾祸，一方面为人民生产电力，供给光明。我们也看到了中国人民为战胜疾病和增进健康而作的斗争，以及诸如此类的事例。
    与此同时，在中国人民中已经展开了一个伟大而广泛的文化教育运动，可以说，整个中国就要成为一所学校，在那里，无论男女老少都要参加学习。热爱和平的、坚毅的、富有天才的、爱好艺术的中国人民将不会再像牛马似的劳累终生，而将作为一个真正的人、一个自由的人、一个具有集体主义思想的人、一个爱好和平的人而生活着。他现在终于将得到近代生活所能提供的最好的知识，并且他将使生活与艺术结合起来，走向幸福无疆的将来。
    我现在所提到的一切还只是一个开始——但真是一个美妙的开始，它预告着一个光明的、灿烂的未来。冰岛访华代表团在逗留在中国的期间，深感到自己是生活在一个有着无尽的财富的国家和有着无限才能的人民中。代表团完全知道，它到中国来的时候，是正当中国悠久的历史进入一个新时代的黎明时期，伟大的中国人民的未来将是人类历史上的一个光辉的胜利。
    新生的人民的天真的喜悦和将要成为国家新主人的青年们的歌唱的热情，也受到了我们的注意，我们深深地被它感动了。在十月一日你们的国庆大典中，我们也卷入了你们的美丽首都的狂欢的五色缤纷的人流中。我们亲眼看到了你们向领导着你们走入新中国的亲爱的领袖们欢呼致敬。这真正是胜利检阅的时刻。而那一天最引人注目的是青年——你们的未来。正是这些青年，在那天高举着写着“世界和平”的标语。
    自从我们到中国来以后，我们最经常地遇到的两个字就是“人民”与“和平”。这两个字是新中国的主要标志，并且在不久的将来，这两个字将成为全世界每一个角落胜利的标志。在这两个字面前，世界上一切侵略者都要投降缴械。所有杀人放火的，迷信原子弹的人，所有压迫人的人与和平的劳动人民的敌人，都要向“人民”与“和平”投降。相信集体主义的人一定会战胜以个人为中心的人，和平一定战胜战争，生命一定战胜死亡！
    这个真理，新中国这两个伟大的标志，当我们回到国内时一定要传达给我们国内的人民。我们感觉到，只有这样做，我们才能在某种程度上稍稍报答一些我们在这里所获得的兄弟般的友谊。
    冰岛访华代表团衷心感谢中国人民外交学会的盛情款待。我们热烈地感谢你们对我们的亲切真挚的感情和你们送给我们的所有的礼物。代表团真诚地希望，在我们两国人民之间，能够建立起更密切的联系，建立在“人民”与“和平”的基础上的联系。我们希望，在不久的将来，事情会发展成为这样，那时，中国的客人们可以到我们遥远的、可爱的冰岛去——到新冰岛，人民民主的冰岛去。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    伟大的毛泽东主席万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
