Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 14th – On November 11th, the U.S. side killed another of our captured personnel at the Jeju Island prisoner-of-war camp. General Nan Ri, chief delegate of our side to the Korean armistice talks, protested to the other side on the 14th, pointing out that the U.S. side must bear full responsibility for the war crime of massacring prisoners of war. From 12:00 to 12:30 on November 13th, U.S. military aircraft violated the agreement and intruded into the airspace over the Panmunjom conference area three times, which was confirmed by a joint investigation by security officers from both sides. On the 14th, our chief liaison officer protested to the other side, demanding that the other side strictly restrain its military personnel to prevent similar incidents from happening again.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 15th – The U.S. side continues to create incidents that violate the conference area agreement. From 12:00 to 12:30 on November 13th, U.S. military aircraft continuously invaded the airspace over the conference area three times. Our chief liaison officer, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, has protested to the other side about this matter.

Prior to this, on November 8th, U.S. military aircraft also intruded into the airspace over the conference area. Although several witnesses to the incident confirmed it, the U.S. side still disregarded the facts and cunningly denied it. Now, U.S. aircraft are even more unscrupulous, daring to intrude into the conference area three times in a row within half an hour. It is worth noting that since the U.S. side interrupted the negotiations on October 8th, they have created a total of nine incidents of various kinds that violate the conference area agreement. They are obviously taking all steps in a planned way to undermine the armistice negotiations.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th – At around 16:40 on November 15th, U.S. military aircraft violated the Korean armistice negotiation conference area agreement and intruded into the airspace over the Panmunjom conference area. Our delegation's chief liaison officer protested to the other side on the 16th, pointing out that the other side has not yet given any explanation for the violation of the agreement by the other side's military aircraft flying over the conference area three times on November 13th, and U.S. military aircraft have once again intruded into the airspace over the conference area. Our chief liaison officer once again requested the other side to earnestly abide by the agreement, strictly restrain its military personnel, and prevent similar incidents from happening again.

    美方又害死我方被俘人员美机并连续侵越会场区上空
    我方南日将军张春山上校分别提出抗议
    【新华社开城十四日电】十一月十一日美方在济州岛战俘营又害死我方被俘人员一人。朝鲜停战谈判我方代表团首席代表南日将军在十四日向对方提出抗议。指出：美方对屠杀战俘的战争罪行必须负完全责任。十一月十三日十二时至十二时三十分，美方军用飞机违反协议，三次侵入板门店会场区上空，经由双方安全军官共同调查证实。十四日我方首席联络官向对方提出抗议，要求对方严格约束其军事人员，使类似事件不再发生。
    【新华社开城十五日电】美方继续不断制造破坏会场区协议事件。十一月十三日十二时到十二时三十分，美方军用飞机连续三次侵越会场区上空。我方首席联络官张春山上校已就此事向对方提出抗议。
    在此以前，十一月八日，美方军用飞机也曾侵入会场区上空，虽经目击这一事件的几个证人证实，美方仍不顾事实，狡猾抵赖。现在美方飞机更加肆无忌惮，竟然在半小时之内连续三次侵入会场区。值得注意的是，自美方十月八日中断谈判以来，他们所制造的各种破坏会场区协议事件已共达九次之多，他们显然正有计划地采取一切步骤来破坏停战谈判。
    【新华社开城十六日电】十一月十五日十六时四十分左右，美方军用飞机违反朝鲜停战谈判会场区协议，侵入板门店会场区上空。我方代表团首席联络官在十六日向对方提出抗议，并指出对方对十一月十三日对方军用飞机三次飞越会场区的违反协议的事件尚未作任何交代，而美方军用飞机竟又一次侵入会场区上空。我方首席联络官再次要求对方切实遵守协议，严格约束其军事人员，使类似事件不再发生。
