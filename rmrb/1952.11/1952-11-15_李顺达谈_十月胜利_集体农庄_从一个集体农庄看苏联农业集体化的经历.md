    Li Shunda Talks About the "October Victory" Collective Farm
    ——Seeing the Soviet Agricultural Collectivization Experience from One Collective Farm
    Yan Ling
    Exactly thirty years ago, in October 1922, the young Soviet Republic celebrated the great victory of liberating the last piece of Soviet land occupied by foreign armed interventionists. From that time on, the Soviet Union entered a new stage of building socialism. Lenin, despite being seriously ill, insisted on working, formulated a plan to absorb farmers into the cause of socialist construction, and pointed out the path for farmers to transition to collective farms through cooperative systems. The "October Victory" Collective Farm in Kyiv Oblast, Ukraine, was born at that time - its "childhood name" was the "Bees and Honeycomb" mutual-aid team. It was one of the earliest and best-run collective farms in the Soviet Union, a pioneer and backbone of Soviet agricultural cooperation and collectivization. The road it has traveled in the past thirty years is a microcosm of the history of Soviet collective farms.

    The first collective farm Li Shunda visited in the Soviet Union was the "October Victory" Collective Farm; it was also the one he spent the most time visiting and the one that impressed him the most. The chairman of this collective farm, Fedor Ivanovich Dubkovetsky, left Li Shunda with an indelible impression. Li Shunda said: "Dubkovetsky's background and experience are very similar to mine. Before the revolution, he also suffered on the landlord's land from childhood, enduring the landlord's steward's whip. After the victory of the October Revolution, he was allocated land, constantly struggled against the counter-revolutionaries, embarked on the path of collectivization indicated by Lenin and Stalin, led the people of the whole village to live better and better lives, and transformed a poor place into a happy and prosperous collective farm. He started running a mutual-aid team at the age of twenty-eight, and for thirty years he has been wholeheartedly leading the mutual-aid team and the collective farm; I also started organizing mutual-aid groups at the age of twenty-eight, and it has been ten years now. He is fifty-eight years old this year, twenty years older than me. When I was visiting him, I thought: if we follow his path and catch up with him for another twenty years, our Xigou Village will definitely catch up with them as they are now. Later I thought: with the Soviet Union as an example, and with the help of the Soviet Union, we will go faster and avoid many detours, and it definitely won't take twenty years."

    "Bees and Honeycomb" Wins
    When Dubkovetsky first started the mutual-aid team, there were very few collective labor organizations for farmers on the entire planet; they were sailing in the vast ocean of individual agricultural economy, and inevitably took some detours. In order to make his brothers go more smoothly, he told the Chinese farmer representatives about their experiences without reservation. At first, they were not clear about how to organize work, how to distribute income, how to deal with livestock and poultry, and how much land individuals could have. But they firmly believed in the call of Lenin and Stalin: collective labor on public land, using new methods of cultivation, could harvest more grain, could enable farmers to get rid of poverty, and become wealthy and civilized people. At that time, saboteurs spread rumors saying: "Whoever joins the mutual-aid team is selling their soul to the devil!" "Nothing can grow in the fields of the mutual-aid team except weeds." At that time, everything was just beginning, and many people still held a skeptical attitude towards the mutual-aid team, and the rumors of bad elements could temporarily play a certain role. Some who had signed up later left. As a result, only nine households participated. At that time, to set up a mutual-aid team, they had to register with the county; but what should they fill in the name column on the registration form? They thought: among animals, the most clean, diligent, and excellent collective laborer is the bee; therefore, they called their mutual-aid team "Bees and Honeycomb." The mutual-aid team was officially established on the fifth anniversary of the October Revolution, and everyone elected Dubkovetsky as the director of the mutual-aid team.

    In the beginning, work was difficult and life was hard. They only had three pairs of horses, three plows, six harrows, and two carts to cultivate 51 hectares (each hectare equals 15 Chinese mu) of land. In the spring, when it was time to sow, the land had not yet been plowed, and there were not enough seeds. There was very little grain, they could only eat black bread and gnaw on pickles. What to do? Relying on the strength of organization, relying on the high labor enthusiasm of the members, and relying on the vanguard role of the Youth League members (there were no party members in the team at that time, and half of the young people were Youth League members); the Soviet government helped them, lending them seeds and farm tools; the Red Army stationed nearby lent them horses. The harvest of crops proved the great role of organization, "Bees and Honeycomb" won, and their first harvest exceeded the harvest of rich peasants who had much better production conditions.

    The most serious struggle between individualism and collectivism within the team occurred during the first distribution of the fruits of labor. Dubkovetsky suggested leaving a portion of the public accumulation fund to buy seeders, carts, etc., and distributing the rest according to the number of people who actually participated in the labor. However, one person who was usually the laziest and most unenthusiastic, at this time "actively" stirred up trouble. He incited a few people to demand that the distribution be made equally according to the total population. They said: if you oppose equality, what kind of collective is that? What kind of new life is that? They also opposed leaving a public accumulation fund. That night, they argued until the rooster crowed twice. Dubkovetsky insisted on his opinion, and most people supported him. As a result, the next day, three people took their horses away from the mutual-aid team - they withdrew.

    The mutual-aid team encountered danger - only six households were left, and according to the government's regulations at that time, this could not be a mutual-aid team. At this time, the Derno District Party Committee assisted them and mobilized twenty young men and women Youth League members to join their mutual-aid team. In order to minimize crop losses and for the sake of a bright future, they moved the mutual-aid team to a grassland farther away from the village and started reclaiming wasteland again. In the spring of 1924, the All-Union Communist Party admitted a large number of outstanding members to the party to commemorate Lenin's death, and Dubkovetsky joined the Communist Party at that time. He became a more powerful person and led everyone to overcome numerous difficulties. Because they moved places, the land had not been autumn-plowed; when sowing in the spring, there were still no seeders, and they could only sow by hand. However, because they exerted the strength of the collective, they still achieved a bumper harvest in the autumn. They bought some horses and farm tools, and also built some public houses.

    The enemies of the mutual-aid team became jealous and came to sabotage again. One night, bad elements set fire to the mutual-aid team's houses and also locked Dubkovetsky's door from the outside. The members woke up in shock, released Dubkovetsky, put out the fire, and fortunately the grain was not damaged, but the house for storing fodder was burned down, and several horses were burned to death.

    They continued to move forward in struggle. They resolutely implemented Lenin's instructions: organized farmers should help all poor peasants and unite with middle peasants. They bought threshing machines and helped individual farmers thresh grain in addition to their own use. The fact that being organized was stronger than working alone caused a sensation in far away places. Many farmers from other regions came to visit them, and many people asked to join; those who had left the mutual-aid team in the past now also returned.

    In 1926, they began to use tractors to plow the land, and began to formulate a one-year cultivation plan under the guidance of the district agricultural officer, improve technology, and implement scientific cultivation methods. In 1927, their winter crops yielded 180 poods per hectare (one pood equals 32.76 Chinese jin). They became richer day by day. They began to plant many apple trees, cherry trees, pear trees, had a mill powered by a diesel engine, and built a large pond for raising fish and storing water. By 1929, the entire team already had thirty-five households, twenty-six horses, and also raised thirty-five dairy cows, five hundred pigs, raised some bees, and harvested several hundred jin of fish from the pond.

    Taking a Detour, Stepping onto the Broad Road
    As production developed and life became prosperous, they wanted to build houses to live in. At that time, a question arose: should they build some small houses for each family to live separately? Or should they build a large house for everyone to live collectively? - At that time, everyone was full of enthusiasm for collective life. After discussion, it was finally decided to build a two-story building. In 1929, everyone in the team moved into this new building. Inside the building, there was a public dining hall, bakery, laundry, and nursery; everyone could choose dishes to eat in the dining hall at will, and a large pig had to be slaughtered every week. They changed the mutual-aid team into a commune-style collective farm, advancing from collective labor to collective life. They thought that this happy life was brought about by the October Revolution, and they started to organize on the fifth anniversary of the October Revolution, so at this time they named their collective farm "October Victory".

    From 1926 to 1929, Soviet industry had made great progress, and many tractor factories had been established; at the same time, the agricultural cooperation movement continued to grow, and some collectivization experience had been accumulated. With such a foundation, the Soviet Union launched a movement to absorb a large number of farmers to establish or join collective farms in the countryside in 1929 and 1930, transitioning to full collectivization. During these two years, people constantly came to visit the "October Victory" Collective Farm almost every day. Their living example played a great role in promoting the full collectivization movement. Those who had visited became activists in the collectivization movement. With a happy and pleasant life in front of them, the rumors fabricated by bad elements such as "collective farms are all public; everyone is only allowed to eat the same food every day," "collective farm people, regardless of men and women, have to sleep under large blankets forty meters wide," "machines plowing the land will compact the land, the smell of gasoline will ruin the land, and crops will not grow," were all shattered by the facts of this collective farm. In one year, they helped the entire Derno District establish ten collective farms.

    However, living a commune life too early would not work. When the commune was first established, the number of participating households was still small, and most of them had been trained in collective labor for a long time, so the situation was still good. Later, Dubkovetsky went out to study, and in one or two years the number of people in the farm increased more than twofold, and without the necessary education and strong leadership, the chairman was changed three times in one or two years. At that time, the farm's land increased from 150 hectares to more than 500 hectares, but it was not managed well. When Dubkovetsky returned to the farm in the spring of 1932, he saw farm tools scattered everywhere in a mess, the dining hall was filled with the smell of tobacco, and the tables were piled with leftover bread, and bread crusts were thrown all over the floor. Because enjoying the same benefits regardless of whether one labored well or badly, the enthusiasm and creativity for production could not be brought into play, the grain harvested was not enough to eat, and there was even more shortage of feed for livestock. Dubkovetsky was very sad, and he was determined to reorganize this farm well. What should he do? He went to the secretary of the district party committee and received guidance and help. After returning to the farm and discussing with the activists, he convened a meeting of the members and mobilized everyone to abandon the commune and still adopt the method of distribution according to labor. At that time, those who had already tasted the "sweetness" of commune life were very unwilling to change. Some of them disliked the trouble of taking care of housework themselves, and felt that with the commune, they did not have to worry about "eating at noon and wearing clothes in season"; some simply wanted to enjoy the same benefits as others without working much in the commune. If this continued, the collective farm would collapse; even if it was lucky enough not to collapse, it could only be勉强维持, and it would not be possible to have great development. After repeated mobilization and persuasion, most of the activists still agreed to distribution according to labor. Finally, a resolution was passed to abolish the public dining hall, and some labor discipline was also established.

    Initially, the "October Victory" Collective Farm and some other collective farms did not have a clear system for calculating workdays. Each person who worked a day would take a bamboo stick, or draw a line in a notebook. Some lazy people who slept in the forest for half a day would still be recorded as a full workday. It was not until the Second All-Soviet Union Collective Farm Shock Workers Congress in 1935 that the "Regulations of the Agricultural Labor Cooperative" were established, which determined the method of calculating workdays by quality and quantity.

    The "October Victory" Collective Farm finally completely changed into a labor cooperative and developed on a normal track, with output continuously increasing. Every year, new facts proved to the farmers that the collective farm system was the only correct way of labor and life for farmers. From 1935 to 1938, the average grain yield reached 1,850 kilograms per hectare. In 1939, they won the second prize certificate of the All-Soviet Union Collective Farm. At that time, they already had enough agricultural machinery, had a laboratory, had their own agricultural technical experts, installed running water from the dormitories to the cowsheds, and also installed wind turbines and had electric lights. They also had vineyards, glass greenhouses for growing vegetables in winter, and a winery. Male members all had serge suits, and female members all wore silk shirts and skirts. Medical stations, schools, clubs with film projectors, and cooperative stores were also gradually established. They also began to build new houses. At this time, no one agreed to build large buildings anymore; every family hoped to have a single house, with several rooms, a kitchen, and a corridor; as soon as they stepped down the stone steps of the corridor, it was their own small garden; when they opened the windows, it was roses and peonies.

    The Flames of War Destroyed Their Farm
    They Built Their Farm Even More Beautifully
    In June 1941, new houses were being built, asphalt roads were being paved, and winter wheat, estimated to yield 2,800 to 3,000 kilograms per hectare, was turning yellow. However, the cannons of the German invaders came. The peaceful and happy life was destroyed. Young people joined the army to defend the motherland. Dubkovetsky and some others retreated to the rear.

    On March 8, 1944, Derno District, Kyiv Oblast, was liberated; on March 9, Dubkovetsky returned here again. Some houses were still burning. The German bandits robbed everything they could take away, and the granaries and livestock sheds were empty; things that could not be taken away were destroyed. The fields were overgrown with weeds; the pond was damaged by water; the willow trees by the pond and the nine hectares of fruit trees were gone, and the grapes were all dead. Running water, generators, mills, etc., were all gone.

    They were determined to rebuild their manor and revive it in the shortest possible time. In order to completely eliminate the enemy, it was necessary to supply grain to the army; in order to get new machines again, it was necessary to supply grain to the factories. Spring plowing and sowing had to be started immediately. They brought into play the indestructible spirit of the Soviet people and started from scratch on a piece of rubble. They repaired a buried tractor and borrowed some horses from the government and began to carry out spring plowing. Tractors and horses were not enough, they also brought out the few remaining dairy cows to drag plows and harrows, and hand shovels were used again. They launched a friendly competition with the nearby "Voroshilov" Collective Farm, which was also devastated, and worked hard to cultivate 70 percent of the cultivated land. By the time of the wheat harvest, they repaired a harvester, and used all the large and small sickles that had not been used for a long time, harvesting during the day and harvesting in the moonlight. Even under the most difficult conditions, they still achieved a good harvest.

    In 1945, the Patriotic War won the final victory. The Soviet people, who were strengthened even more in the war, rebuilt their peaceful life with their own hands. In the first summer after the war, the "October Victory" Collective Farm repaired all the seeders, harvesters, cultivators, and plows with its own strength, rebuilt some houses, installed generators, oil presses, electric mills, and restored fruit trees, vegetables, and bees. In 1946, they planted all the cultivated land.

    A small river flowed through their farm. Dubkovetsky said that more than twenty years ago, he dreamed of using the hydropower of this small river to generate electricity. In 1947, they turned this dream into reality. They dismantled some materials from destroyed tanks, transformed other destroyed war tools into lathes, and under the leadership of a newly joined member - retired air force electrician and mechanic Skibets, they self-made two huge hydroelectric turbines, each with 200 kilowatts of electricity, and installed them on the small river. They moved the farm's original generator and successfully built a 400-kilowatt hydroelectric power station. Now, all heavy labor can be done by electricity. Electricity has further liberated them. Milking cows, watering livestock, chopping grass, grinding flour, extracting oil, and sawing wood are all done by electricity. Not only has the number of people needed for each type of work been reduced, but also it has been done faster and better. Electric stoves, electric kettles, electric irons, and radios are available in every home. Greenhouses for raising early-maturing vegetables and cultivating seedlings also use electric heating. In this way, their electricity is still not used up, and it can also be supplied to other nearby farms.

    In 1949, Soviet agricultural mechanization and electrification had made great progress. In order to make it easier to use electricity and new large-scale agricultural machinery, the collective farm merger movement began. The nearby "Wave" Collective Farm merged into the "October Victory" Collective Farm. They had a total of 1,393 hectares of land (including 1,102 hectares of cultivated land), 257 households, 701 people, 327 laborers, 113 cows, 105 horses, and also many pigs, sheep, and poultry. In 1949, the government announced a three-year plan for developing collectively owned livestock on collective farms; their farm's plan was overfulfilled in one year. The government awarded them two large cars, one small car, and 10,000 rubles in cash for this. They implemented a grass-field crop rotation system, planted protective forest belts, and built ten new large ponds, and the yield increased year by year. In 1950, their total income was 1,314,000 rubles, and in 1951 it reached more than 2 million rubles.

    Unforgettable Days, Unforgettable People
    When the Chinese farmers' representatives arrived at the "October Victory" Collective Farm, it was a relatively slack season for farming. Dubkovetsky and many people in the farm led them to visit the farm's fields, livestock sheds, bee farms, orchards, etc. in detail. At that time, the rye was in bloom, growing six or seven feet high, and it was impossible to see anyone inside; the wheat was heading, already growing waist-high. Li Shunda said that their crops were really gratifying to see.

    The days at the "October Victory" Collective Farm were some of the most unforgettable days for the Chinese farmers' representatives. They saw so many new things during the visit and gained many very valuable collectivization experiences and high-yield methods. On sunny days, they sat in the birch forest and listened to the reports of Dubkovetsky and the farm's agricultural experts, animal husbandry experts, and accountants on various issues such as the regulations of the labor cooperative, the pasture rotation system, the income and expenditure situation, the development of animal husbandry, and collective farm life. Every night there was a soiree, and the farm's song and dance troupe and orchestra performed wonderful programs, and everyone toasted to the health of Mao Zedong and Stalin together.

    What Li Shunda remembers most is the chairman of the farm, Dubkovetsky, and his wife, Chubain. He extremely admired their spirit of collectivism. Both of them were born as hired laborers and are now socialist labor heroes, and have received the highest Soviet medal - the Gold Star Medal. Dubkovetsky was elected as a representative to the All-Union Supreme Soviet in February 1946 and met Stalin in the Kremlin; in February 1947, when the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party discussed the historic resolution on improving cultivation methods, Malenkov invited ten collective farm chairmen to participate in the discussion, and he was one of them. Chubain participated in the significant Second All-Soviet Union Collective Farm Shock Workers Congress in February 1935 (which formulated the Agricultural Labor Cooperative Regulations and suggested that the government announce a decree that all land cultivated by collective farms should be permanently used by collective farms), and also met Stalin. Later, she also participated in the Seventh All-Soviet Union Soviet Congress (which passed the famous constitutional amendment). They are all so fond of the cause of the collective farm. They work selflessly and labor actively, really like decades of service, wholeheartedly serving the collective farm. Chubain is a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Ukrainian Republic and also works in the district executive committee, but she still asks to work in the fields as a production team leader. A team she led created a record of high yield of more than 20,000 kilograms of potatoes per hectare.

    Li Shunda said: One morning, we went to Dubkovetsky's home. They have a very simple and beautiful residence. Walking into the house, we saw pictures of Lenin, Stalin, and Chairman Mao hanging on the wall, as well as the awards they had received in the past. There were also photos of two young people. Chubain said that these were her two children, who both gloriously sacrificed on the front lines in the last winter of the Patriotic War. Now they only have one daughter, Marosiya. Marosiya learned to drive a tractor during the war; now she works at their farm's hydroelectric power station. There is a granddaughter who lives with the elderly couple. Li Shunda said that when they went to his house, they saw this girl sleeping on a bright steel bed. On the windows, there were several pots of fresh flowers; the cherry trees and pear trees outside the window looked particularly fresh and green in the drizzle. This made people particularly feel the preciousness of peace. The German bandits destroyed the results of their hard work for one or two decades, but they restored their farm in a few years and built the farm even more beautifully. This is the most reliable force for defending peace.

    Our Mountain Ravine Also Has a Bright Future
    Li Shunda said: "Our Xigou Village was also severely damaged by the enemy in the War of Resistance Against Japan. In such a small village, more than a dozen people were killed, and more than fifty houses were burned, even straw stacks and kiln doors were burned; seven animals were also robbed. I must learn the spirit of Dubkovetsky, lead the masses of the whole village to implement the three-year construction plan well, and build Xigou better. In the past, I also believed that socialism must be realized, and I also saw various machines for planting land in Beijing and Tianjin. However, I always thought that our mountain land is small, and machines cannot be placed or used; I am afraid there will not be much development. Therefore, my confidence is always not very high. This time I looked at how the Soviet collective farms raise livestock and plant trees, and I saw the road to socialism and communism for the mountain land. The climate in Ukraine is similar to ours. Many trees there can be planted. I have already learned a set of afforestation methods, and also brought back a set of tree grafting tools and some good cherry seeds. The Soviet Union pays the most attention to improving varieties, even wild ones are used to transform. We are not afraid that some trees are not suitable for growing here, we can study and transform them. Our sheep produce less wool, and it is not good, so we must also find ways to improve the breed. We are also poor in agricultural technology. After seeing the Soviet farmers' methods of planting land, we must talk more about science and technology if we want to grow more grain. We can also block the mountain ravines to store water and raise fish, and there is no problem in raising bees, and raising dairy cows is not impossible. This time I visited the Soviet Union, and I have completely seen the future." Li Shunda talked very excitedly. He said: "Who doesn't like to eat fruit? Who doesn't like to wear woolen clothes? How much timber will the country's major construction use! How much leather will our army use! Develop forestry and animal husbandry well, follow the path of Soviet farmers and move forward, our mountain ravine has a very bright future." (Attached picture)

He showed Li Shunda the "Land Permanent Use Certificate" issued to their collective farm by the government, explaining that the land in the Soviet Union is state-owned, but since 1935, a decree has been announced stipulating that all land cultivated by collective farms shall be permanently used by collective farms.

    李顺达谈“十月胜利”集体农庄
    ——从一个集体农庄看苏联农业集体化的经历
    燕凌
    整整三十年以前，一九二二年十月，年轻的苏维埃共和国庆祝了把外国武装干涉者所占领的最后一块苏维埃国土解放出来的巨大胜利。从那时候起，苏联进入了建设社会主义的新阶段。列宁在重病中坚持工作，拟定了吸收农民参加社会主义建设事业的计划，为农民指出了经过合作制过渡到集体农庄的道路。乌克兰基也辅州的“十月胜利”集体农庄就是在那个时候诞生的——它的“乳名”是“蜜蜂和蜂窝”共耕社。它是全苏联办得最早也最好的集体农庄之一，是苏联农业合作化、集体化的先锋和骨干。三十年来它走过的道路，也就是苏联集体农庄的历史的缩影。
    李顺达到苏联参观的第一个集体农庄，就是“十月胜利”集体农庄；参观时间最长印象最深的也是这个集体农庄。这个集体农庄的主席费多尔·伊凡诺维奇·杜布柯维茨基，给李顺达留下永远不能磨灭的印象。李顺达说：“杜布柯维茨基的出身、经历和我很是相似。在革命以前，他也是从小就在地主的土地上受苦，挨地主管家的鞭子。十月革命胜利以后，分到了土地，和反革命不断进行斗争，走上列宁、斯大林指示的集体化道路，领导全村人民过着越来越好的生活，把一个穷困的地方变成了幸福的富裕的集体农庄。他二十八岁开始办共耕社，三十年来，一直全心全意领导共耕社和集体农庄；我也是二十八岁开始组织互助组，到今年有十来年了。他今年五十八岁，比我整大二十岁。在他那里参观的时候，我就想：照着他的路线再赶他二十年，我们西沟村一定能赶上他们现在这个样子。后来我又想：有了苏联的榜样，有了苏联的帮助，我们会走得更快，而且要少走许多弯路，一定用不了二十年。”
    “蜜蜂和蜂窝”胜利了
    当杜布柯维茨基初办共耕社的时候，整个地球上还很少有集体劳动的农民组织；他们在个体农业经济的汪洋大海里航行，不免走了一些弯路。为了使自己的兄弟们走得顺利一些，他把他们的经历，毫无保留地告诉了中国农民代表们。最初，工作怎么组织，收入怎么分配，家畜家禽怎么处理，私人可以有多少土地，他们都是不清楚的。但是他们坚决相信列宁、斯大林的号召：在公有的土地上，集体劳动，用新的方法耕作，就能收获更多的谷物，就能使农民摆脱贫穷，变成富裕、文明的人。那时，破坏分子造谣说：“谁参加共耕社，谁就是把灵魂卖给了魔鬼！”“共耕社的地里，除了野草，什么也长不起来。”那时，一切都是刚在开始，不少人对共耕社还抱着怀疑的态度，坏分子的谣言暂时还能起一定的作用。有些报了名的，后来又离开了。结果，参加的只有九户。当时办共耕社，都要到县里登记；但是在登记表上的名称栏中怎么填呢？他们想：在动物中，最清洁、勤劳、优秀的集体劳动者，就是蜜蜂；于是，就把自己的共耕社叫做“蜜蜂和蜂窝”。共耕社在十月革命五周年纪念日正式成立了，大家选了杜布柯维茨基做共耕社主任。
    起初，工作是艰难的，生活是困苦的。他们只有三对马、三张犁、六盘耙、两辆马车，要种五十一公顷（每公顷合我国十五市亩）土地。春天，该播种了，地还没有耕过，种籽也不够。粮食很少，只能吃黑面包、啃咸菜。怎么办呢？依靠组织起来的力量，依靠社员们高度的劳动热情，依靠青年团员的先锋作用（社内当时还没有党员，有一半青年人是青年团员）；苏维埃政府帮助了他们，借给他们种籽和农具；驻扎在附近的红军把马借给他们用。庄稼的收成证明了组织起来的伟大作用，“蜜蜂和蜂窝”胜利了，他们第一次的收成就超过了生产条件好得多的富农的收成。
    社内个人主义思想和集体主义思想的最严重的一次斗争，是在第一次分配劳动果实的时候。杜布柯维茨基建议留下一部分公积金，买播种机、马车等等，其余按实际参加劳动的人数分配。可是，平时最懒最不积极的一个人，这时却“积极”地捣起乱来了。他煽动了几个人，要求按全部人口平均分配。他们说：你反对平等，那还算什么集体呢？还算什么新生活呢？他们并且反对留公积金。那天夜里，他们一直争论到鸡叫两遍。杜布柯维茨基坚持他的意见，多数人都支持他。结果，第二天，有三个人把他们的马从共耕社牵走了——退社了。
    共耕社碰到了危险——只剩了六户，按照当时政府的规定，这就不能成为一个共耕社了。这时，德尔诺依区党委援助了他们，动员了二十个男女青年团员参加了他们的共耕社。为了使庄稼少受损失，为了远大的发展前途，他们把共耕社搬到离村子较远的一片草原上，重新开起荒来。一九二四年春天，联共为纪念列宁逝世而吸收了一大批优秀份子入党，杜布柯维茨基就在那时加入了共产党。他成了一个更有力量的人，领导大家战胜了重重困难。因为移了地方，土地都没有经过秋耕；春天播种时，仍然没有播种机，只能用手播种。可是，因为发挥了集体的力量，秋天还是获得了丰收。他们买了一些马和农具，还盖了几所公用的房屋。
    共耕社的敌人眼红了，又来进行破坏。一个夜里，坏分子放火烧了共耕社的房子，还反锁了杜布柯维茨基的屋门。社员们惊醒了，把杜布柯维茨基放出来，把火扑灭了，粮食幸而没有受损失，可是放饲料的房子被烧光了，马被烧死了几匹。
    他们在斗争中继续前进。他们坚决执行列宁的指示：组织起来的农民要帮助一切贫农，要团结中农。他们买了脱粒机，除了自己用，还帮助个体农民打谷。组织起来比单干强的事实轰动了很远的地方。其他地区许多农民都到他们那里去参观，很多人要求加入；过去脱离了共耕社的，现在也回来了。
    一九二六年，他们开始使用拖拉机耕地，开始在区里的农业员指导下订了一年的耕作计划，改进技术，实行科学化的耕作方法。一九二七年，他们的冬季作物每公顷收了一百八十普特（一普特等于我国三十二点七六市斤）。他们一天比一天富裕起来了。他们开始种了许多苹果树、樱桃树、梨树，有了用柴油机发动的磨坊，修了一个可以养鱼、蓄水的大池塘。到一九二九年，全社已经有了三十五户，有了二十六匹马，还养了三十五头奶牛，五百只猪，养了一些蜜蜂，池塘里收了几百斤鱼。
    走过一段弯路，跨上康庄大道
    生产发展了，生活富裕了，他们要盖住的房子了。那时，碰到了一个问题：盖一些小房子每户人家分开住呢？还是盖一个大房子，大家集体合住呢？——当时，大家对于集体生活充满热情，经过讨论，最后决定盖一座两层大楼。一九二九年，全社的人都住进这座新楼房去了。楼房里面设立了公共食堂、面包房、洗衣房、托儿所；大家可以在食堂里随意选菜吃，每星期要杀一只大猪。他们把共耕社改变成了公社式的集体农庄，从集体劳动进而集体生活。他们想，这幸福的生活都是十月革命带给的，他们又是在十月革命的第五个周年纪念日开始组织起来的，就在这时把自己的集体农庄命名为“十月胜利”。
    从一九二六年到一九二九年，苏联的工业有了很大的发展，好多拖拉机工厂已经建立起来；同时，农业合作化运动继续增长着，已经积累了一些集体化的经验。有了这样的基础，苏联就在一九二九、一九三○年间在农村开展了吸收大批农民成立或加入集体农庄的运动，过渡到全面集体化。这两年间，几乎每天不断有人到“十月胜利”集体农庄参观。他们这个活的榜样对于全面集体化运动起了很大推动作用。去参观过的人，都成了集体化运动的积极分子。幸福愉快的生活摆在他们面前，坏分子制造的“集体农庄是一切归公；大家每天只许吃一样的饭”，“集体农庄的人不分男女，要伙盖着四十公尺宽的大毯子睡觉”，“机器种地会把地压实，汽油味会把地薰坏，庄稼长不成”等等谣言，都被这个集体农庄的事实粉碎了。他们一年间就帮助全德尔诺依区办成了十个集体农庄。
    可是，过早地过公社生活是不行的。最初成立公社时，参加的户数还少，而且大都是较长期在一起受了集体劳动的锻炼的，情形还好。后来，杜布柯维茨基出去学习了，一两年间农庄的人数增加了两倍多，而且没有进行应有的教育，没有坚强的领导，一两年间就换了三次主席。那时，农庄的土地由一百五十公顷增加到了五百多公顷，可是经营得很不好。当一九三二年春天杜布柯维茨基回到农庄的时候，看到农具到处乱七八糟地放着，食堂里充满了烟草味，桌子上堆着许多吃剩的面包，面包皮扔了一地。因为劳动得好劳动得很坏都一样享受，生产积极性和创造性不能发挥，打的粮食不够吃，牲口的饲料缺得更多。杜布柯维茨基非常伤心，他下决心一定要把这个农庄重新整顿好。该怎么办呢？他去找党的区委书记，得到了指导和帮助。他回到农庄，和积极分子商量之后，就召集庄员大会，动员大家放弃公社，仍然采用按劳分配的办法。那时，已经尝到公社生活的“甜头”的人，很不愿意改变过来。他们有的嫌自己照管家务麻烦，觉得有了公社，“到晌吃饭，到季穿衣”，自己不用操心；有的干脆是想在公社不多劳动也和别人一样享受。这样下去，集体农庄就会垮台；即使幸而不垮，也只能勉强维持，不可能有大的发展。经过一再动员说服，多数积极分子还是赞成按劳分配。最后，通过决议把公共食堂取消了，还订了一些劳动纪律。
    最初，“十月胜利”集体农庄和别的一些集体农庄都没有明确的计算劳动日的制度。每人做一天活就拿一个竹签，或者在本子上划一道。有的懒人在树林里睡了半天觉，也还是记一个整工。一九三五年第二次全苏联集体农庄突击队员代表大会定下了“农业劳动组合章程”，才确定了定质定量计算劳动日的办法。
    “十月胜利”集体农庄终于完全改变成了劳动组合，在正常的轨道上发展着，产量不断提高着。每一个年头，都有新的事实向农民证明集体农庄制度是农民的唯一正确的劳动和生活的方式。一九三五年到一九三八年，粮食的平均产量达到了每公顷一千八百五十公斤。一九三九年，他们获得了全苏联集体农庄的第二名奖状。那时，他们已经有了足够用的农业机器，有了实验室，有了自己的农业技术专家，从宿舍到牛舍都装上了自来水，还装设了风力发电机，有了电灯。他们还有了葡萄园、冬天种菜的玻璃暖房、酿酒厂。男庄员都有了哔叽衣服，女庄员都穿上了绸子衫裙。医疗站、学校、有电影放映机的俱乐部、合作商店也都渐渐建立起来了。他们又开始建筑新的房舍了。这时，谁也不赞成盖大楼房了；每家都希望有一幢单个的房子，有几个房间，有厨房，有走廊；一踏下走廊的石阶，就是自己的小花园；打开窗子，就是玫瑰和牡丹。
    战火摧毁了他们的农庄
    他们把农庄建设得更美丽
    一九四一年六月，新房子正在建筑着，柏油路正在铺设着，估计每公顷可以收到二千八百到三千公斤的冬小麦正在变黄。可是，德国侵略者的大炮打来了。和平幸福的生活被摧毁了。青年们为保卫祖国参军了。杜布柯维茨基和别的一些人撤退到了后方。
    一九四四年三月八日，基也辅州德尔诺依区解放了；三月九日，杜布柯维茨基就又回到了这里。有些房子还在燃烧。德寇把一切能带的东西都抢走了，粮仓、畜舍都是空空的；带不走的东西，都被破坏了。地里长满了野草；池塘被水冲坏了；池边的柳树和九公顷果木都不见了，葡萄都死了。自来水、发电机、磨坊等等，都没有了。
    他们决心重新建设自己的庄园，要在最短的时间使它复活。为了彻底消灭敌人，就必须把粮食供应军队；为了重新得到机器，就必须以粮食供应工厂。春耕播种必须马上着手。他们发挥了苏维埃人民的无坚不摧的精神，在一片废墟上从头干起来了。他们把埋藏的一台拖拉机修理好，又从政府贷到了几匹马，就开始进行春耕。拖拉机和马不够用，他们把仅剩的几头奶牛也牵出来拖犁耙，手铲子又使上了。他们和附近同样被摧残了的“伏罗希洛夫”集体农庄展开了友谊的竞赛，紧张地耕作着，把耕地种上了百分之七十。到麦收时，他们修好了一部收割机，又把早已不用的大小镰刀都用上，白天收割，月光下也收割。在最艰苦的情况下，还是得到了好收成。
    一九四五年，卫国战争得到了最后的胜利。在战争中锻炼得更加坚强的苏联人民，用双手重建自己的和平生活。“十月胜利”集体农庄在战后的第一个夏季，就用自己的力量修好了所有的播种机、收割机、中耕机和犁，重新建筑了一些房舍，装上了发电机，榨油机，电动的磨子，水果树、蔬菜、蜜蜂都恢复了起来。一九四六年，他们就把耕地全部种上了。
    他们的农庄有一条小河流过。杜布柯维茨基说，在二十多年前，他就梦想着利用这小河的水力发电。一九四七年，他们把这个梦想变成了现实。他们从破坏了的坦克上拆下一些材料，把破坏了的别的战争工具改造成了车床，在新参加的一个庄员——退伍空军、电机机械师斯基别茨的领导下，自造了两只巨大的各二百瓩电力的水力透平机，安装在小河上。把农庄原有的发电机搬来，建设成功了一个四百瓩的水力发电站。现在，一切重劳动都可以由电力来担任了。电力把他们进一步解放了。挤牛奶、饮牲口、铡草、磨面、榨油、锯木料都用电力来做。不但每种工作需要的人减少了，而且做得又快又好。电炉子、电暖壶、电熨斗、收音机，每家都有。养早熟的蔬菜和培苗用的暖房，也利用了电热。就这样，他们的电力还用不完，还可以供给附近别的农庄使用。
    一九四九年，苏联农业机械化和电气化已经有了大的发展。为了更便于使用电力和新式大型农业机器，集体农庄合并运动开始了。附近的“浪”集体农庄合并到了“十月胜利”集体农庄中。他们总共有了一千三百九十三公顷土地（其中有一千一百零二公顷耕地），二百五十七户，七百零一口人，三百二十七个劳动力，有一百一十三头牛，一百零五匹马，还有许多猪、羊和家禽。一九四九年政府公布了发展集体农庄公有牲畜的三年计划；他们这个农庄的计划在一年里就超额完成了。政府为这奖给他们两辆大汽车、一辆小汽车、一万卢布现金。他们实行着草田轮作制、种植了防护林带、新建了十个大池塘，产量一年比一年提高。一九五○年他们的收入总值是一百三十一万四千卢布，一九五一年就达到了二百万卢布以上。
    难忘的日子，难忘的人
    我国农民代表到“十月胜利”集体农庄的时候，正是农事比较松闲的季节。杜布柯维茨基和农庄里的许多人领着他们到农庄的田间、畜舍、蜂场、果园等处详细地参观了一遍。那时，黑麦正在开花，长的有六七尺高，进去个人就看不见了；小麦正在出穗，已经长了拦腰高。李顺达说，他们的庄稼长得真是喜人。
    在“十月胜利”集体农庄的一些日子，是我国农民代表最难忘的一些日子。他们在参观中看到那么多新鲜的事物，得到许多非常可贵的集体化的经验和丰产的办法。在晴朗的日子，他们坐在桦树林里，听杜布柯维茨基和农庄里的农业专家、畜牧专家、会计师作的关于劳动组合章程、牧草轮作制、收入支出情况、畜牧的发展和集体农庄生活上的各种问题的报告。每天晚上都有联欢晚会，农庄的歌舞团、音乐队表演了精采的节目，大家一同为毛泽东、斯大林的健康干杯。
    李顺达最难忘的，还是农庄主席杜布柯维茨基和他的妻子楚芭恩。他极其敬佩他们的集体主义的事业精神。他们两个都是雇农出身，现在都是社会主义劳动英雄，得到了苏联最高的奖章——金星奖章。杜布柯维茨基在一九四六年二月当选为全苏最高苏维埃代表，在克里姆林宫见过斯大林；一九四七年二月联共中央全会讨论关于改进耕作方法的历史性决议案时，马林科夫曾请了十个集体农庄主席去参加讨论，他也是其中的一个。楚芭恩在一九三五年二月就参加过有重大意义的第二次全苏联集体农庄突击队员代表大会（那次大会制订了农业劳动组合章程，并建议政府宣布集体农庄耕种的一切土地交归集体农庄永久使用的法令），也见过斯大林。后来，她还参加了第七届全苏联苏维埃代表会议
    （那次会议通过了著名的宪法修正案）。他们都是那么热爱集体农庄的事业。他们忘我地工作，积极地劳动，真是数十年如一日，全心全意为集体农庄服务。楚芭恩是乌克兰共和国中央执行委员会的委员，并且在区执委会工作，可是她仍然要求到田间工作，做一个生产队长。她领导的一个队，创造了每公顷生产两万多公斤马铃薯的高额产量纪录。
    李顺达说：一天早上，我们到杜布柯维茨基家里去了。他们有一所很简单又很漂亮的住宅。走进屋门，就看见墙上挂着列宁、斯大林和毛主席的像，还有他们历次得到的奖状。还有两个青年的照片。楚芭恩说，这是她的两个孩子，都是卫国战争的最后一个冬季在前线光荣牺牲的。现在他们就只有一个女儿玛罗西娅了。玛罗西娅在战争期间学会了开拖拉机；现在在他们农庄的水电站工作。有一个外孙女和他们老俩口同住。李顺达说，他们去他家时，看到这个女孩子正在明晃晃的钢丝床上睡着。窗子上，放着几盆鲜花；窗外的樱桃树和梨树在细雨中显得特别清新翠绿。这使人特别感到和平的可贵。德寇摧毁了他们一二十年辛勤经营的成果，可是他们几年之中就恢复了自己的农庄，而且把农庄建设得更美丽了。这就是保卫和平的一支最可靠的力量。
    我们的山沟也有远大的前途
    李顺达说：“我们的西沟村，在抗日战争中也受到了敌人的惨重破坏。那样一个小村，就被杀死十几口人，被烧了五十多间房子，连草垛、窑门都被烧掉了；还被抢走了七头牲口。我一定要学习杜布柯维茨基的精神，领着全村群众好好实行三年建设计划，把西沟建设得更好。过去，我也相信社会主义一定要实现，我到北京天津也看到了种地用的各种机器。可是，我总想着，我们山里地块小，机器搁不下，使不开；恐怕不会有多大发展头。因此，信心总是不很高。这次我瞧了苏联的集体农庄怎么样养牲口、种树木，就看见了山地通到社会主义、共产主义的大路。乌克兰的气候和我们那里差不多。我们那里好多树木都可以栽。我已经学了一套造林的办法，还带回来一套接树家具，一些好樱桃种籽。苏联最注意改良品种了，连野生的也拿来改造。我们不怕有些树不适于在我们这里生长，我们可以研究改造它。我们那些羊出羊毛少，而且不好，也要想办法改良品种。农业技术上也还差劲，看了苏联农民的种地办法，我们要多打粮食非更讲科学技术不行。我们那里拦住山沟也能蓄水养鱼，养蜂更没问题，养奶牛，也不是办不到的。这一次到苏联参观，我算把前途彻底看清楚了。”李顺达谈起来非常兴奋。他说：“谁不爱吃果子？谁不爱穿毛呢衣服？国家大建设要用多少木材！咱们的军队要用多少皮子！好好发展林业畜牧业，照着苏联农民的路
    往前走，我们的山沟前途是很远大的。”（附图片）
    “十月胜利”集体农庄主席杜布柯维茨基（中）正在和李顺达（右）谈话。他把政府发给他们集体农庄的“土地永久使用证书”拿给李顺达看，说明苏联的土地是国有的，但从一九三五年起宣布了一个法令，规定各个集体农庄耕种的土地永久归各个集体农庄使用。
