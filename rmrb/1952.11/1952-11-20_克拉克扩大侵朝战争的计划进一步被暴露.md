Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th - Clark's plans to continue and expand the war have been even more blatantly revealed, despite his denial on the 17th, due to opposition from the American and world's people, that he had requested the addition of several divisions of American troops to launch an offensive in Korea.
    The Associated Press, in reporting Clark's denial of the request for additional troops, also revealed that Clark did indeed have a plan to launch a large-scale offensive, but officers close to Clark believed that he would not launch a large-scale offensive until the plan was approved by Washington.
    Clark's plan is, in effect, to demand that other countries in the United Nations send more troops to fight for the United States in Korea. United Press International's Tokyo dispatch on the 17th revealed the content of this plan. UPI, quoting so-called "well-informed sources" and "observers," said that Clark "apparently welcomes orders to launch a major offensive if he can get the maximum 'all-out war' support from the United States and its Western allies." These people said: "American soldiers at all levels of command in Korea privately express dissatisfaction with the small number of troops contributed by most Allied countries to the United Nations forces." They "expect" Clark to urge Eisenhower to directly demand that European and Asian countries "assume a greater burden" in the Korean War.
    UPI's dispatch said that in order to solve the "costly and morale-sapping Korean stalemate," Clark might suggest the following measures. The first measure is to "continue limited combat activity on the current stalemated front." The second is that "the entire free world should try to quickly strengthen the United Nations forces," and then "launch a fierce attack without being restricted from attacking the Chinese mainland." The third is to "launch a large-scale land, air, and amphibious offensive in late spring next year," "regardless of whether the United Nations agrees." The fourth measure is to "withdraw most of the American troops," rapidly expand the Syngman Rhee puppet army, "use and arm" the Kuomintang bandit troops and "other anti-communist forces," and conduct an indefinite "border war" along the current front. The last measure is to abandon the unreasonable demand to forcibly detain prisoners of war and immediately cease fire.
    Obviously, Clark's plan to launch a large-scale offensive, sent to Washington, does not include the last measure. But all these measures, except the last one, are ways to continue and expand the war, and ways to use the troops of other countries to die for the American troops.

### 克拉克扩大侵朝战争的计划进一步被暴露

    克拉克扩大侵朝战争的计划进一步被暴露
    【新华社开城十九日电】由于美国和世界人民的反对，克拉克在十七日否认他要求增调几师美军，以便在朝鲜发动一次攻势。但是紧随着这种空口否认，克拉克的继续和扩大战争的计划却更露骨地透露了出来。
    美联社在报道克拉克否认要求增调美军时，同时就透露说，克拉克的确有这样一个发动大规模攻势的计划，但是和克拉克接近的军官认为，在这个计划没有得到华盛顿批准以前，他不会发动大规模攻势。
    克拉克的计划，实际上就是要求联合国其他国家出更多的兵来替美国在朝鲜进行“大战”。合众社东京十七日电透露了这个计划的内容。合众社引用所谓“消息灵通人士”和“观察家”的话说，克拉克“显然欢迎发动大进攻的命令，如果他确能得到美国及西方盟国的最大限度的‘大战’支持的话。”这些人士说：“在朝鲜各级司令部中的美国军人对大多数盟国国家在联合国军队中出兵很少一节，私下表示不满。”他们“预料”克拉克将敦促艾森豪威尔直率地要求欧洲和亚洲国家在朝鲜战争中“承担比较大的负担”。
    合众社的消息说，为了解决“代价高昂的和败坏士气的朝鲜僵局问题”，克拉克可能建议采取下面这些办法。第一个办法是“继续维持目前僵持战线上的有限的战斗活动”。第二个办法是“整个自由世界应尽力赶快加强联合国军队”，然后“进行猛烈的攻击，而不再受关于攻击中国大陆的限制”。第三个办法是“不管联合国是否同意”，“于明年春末发动陆空军及两栖的大攻势”。第四个办法是“撤出大部分美军”，迅速扩充李承晚伪军，“使用并且武装”国民党匪军和“其他反共军队”，沿目前战线进行无限期的“边界战”。最后一个办法是放弃强迫扣留战俘的无理主张，立即停战。
    很明显，克拉克给华盛顿的发动大规模进攻的计划，是不包括最后一个办法在内的。但是所有这些办法，除了最后一个以外，全是继续和扩大战争的办法，并且是用其他国家的军队来给美国军队替死的办法。
