(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 2nd) According to TASS, Moscow: The people of Moscow are greeting the 35th anniversary of the October Revolution with new labor achievements. The socialist production competition, which began in order to greet the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, has continued to develop into a mass movement to welcome the October Revolution Anniversary. Many factories have already completed their ten-month plans ahead of schedule, including the Milling Iron Factory, the factory manufacturing carburetors and pumping equipment, and the Frunze Textile Factory. The Stalin Automobile Factory has completed the orders needed for the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station and the Stalingrad Hydropower Station ahead of schedule. Workshops in the factory are completing their ten-month production tasks one after another. The personnel of the "750" rolling mill of the "Hammer and Sickle" factory overproduced 600 tons of rolled metal in October. Locomotive personnel at the Moscow marshalling yard hauled trains weighing thousands of tons above the axle load. At the construction site of the Moscow subway, construction teams are working day and night in the tunnels. The last two stations of the large circular line will soon be completed. Many new residential buildings in Moscow will be completed before the festival. A five-story apartment building has recently been completed and is ready for the workers of the "Warrior" machine factory, which manufactures petroleum industry equipment, to move in. Workers at the Red Proletarian Machine Tool Factory are about to hold a housewarming banquet in a new residential building.
