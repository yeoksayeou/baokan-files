    “This is the public property of our agricultural producers' cooperative!”
    Editor: The members of the agricultural producers' cooperative in Luoquanjia Village, Bahechuan District, Kuandian County, Liaodong Province, have greatly improved their collectivist thinking through the education of the Party and the practice of collective production. One very cold spring morning, cooperative member Yang Tiande had just gone up the mountain when he saw the cooperative's large cow running up the mountain. The cow had fallen down among the grass and given birth to a calf. Yang Tiande thought to himself: “It’s so cold, and the wind is blowing so hard, if the calf isn’t wrapped up, it will freeze to death. This is the public property of our agricultural producers' cooperative!” Regardless of his own discomfort, he took off his cotton coat, wrapped up the calf, and held it tightly in his arms, and carried it back to the cooperative. At the cooperative members' meeting, he received praise from all the members. Sun Cai, the sixty-two-year-old head of the animal husbandry team, expressed his determination at the meeting to learn from Yang Tiande and guarantee the good care of the livestock. From then on, Sun Cai meticulously fed and grazed the livestock, regardless of wind or rain.
    Zhang Wenchun, Director of the Luoquanjia Village Agricultural Producers' Cooperative

    “这是咱农业生产合作社的公共财产啊！”
    编辑同志：辽东省宽甸县八河川区罗圈夹村农业生产合作社社员，经过党的教育和集体生产的锻炼，集体主义思想都大大地提高了。一个很冷的春天早晨，社员杨天德刚上山，就看见社里的大母牛往山上跑。母牛倒在草棵子里下了小牛犊。杨天德寻思：“天那么冷，风刮得那么大，要不用东西包起牛犊，它就要冻死。这是咱农业生产合作社的公共财产啊！”他不顾自己受冷，脱下棉衣，包起牛犊，用两只胳膊紧紧抱着，送回社里。在社员大会上，他受到了全体社员的表扬。六十二岁的畜牧组长孙才，在会上表示了决心，要向杨天德学习，保证饲养好牲畜。从这以后，孙才不管风和雨，总是细心地喂养和放牧着牲畜。
