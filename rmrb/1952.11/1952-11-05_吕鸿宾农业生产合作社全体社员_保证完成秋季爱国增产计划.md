    All Members of the Lü Hongbin Agricultural Production Cooperative
    Guarantee to Complete the Autumn Patriotic Increase Production Plan

    Respected Chairman Mao: We, all the members of the Lü Hongbin Agricultural Production Cooperative, are reporting our achievements in agricultural production to you with joy. We have organized ourselves according to your instructions, and our production level has improved year by year. Before liberation, we only harvested 154 jin of grain per mu per year. After organizing mutual aid teams, we produced an average of 415 jin of grain per mu. After organizing the agricultural production cooperative, the crops grew even better. This year, the average yield of wheat per mu was 267 jin, with high-yield land reaching over 500 jin; the average yield of spring corn per mu was 1,159 jin, with high-yield land reaching over 1,430 jin. Other late autumn crops are also growing vigorously; now the Victory Hundred variety of sweet potatoes already weighs four or five jin per mound, and the kenaf is growing thick and tall, a truly delightful green!
    Our cooperative's public property has increased year by year. The cooperative has added three new-style plows, eight Liberation-style waterwheels, two sprayers, one small powder sprayer, two corn threshers, and one weeder. We have also bought six large yellow cattle, one horse, and six large donkeys. The flour mill that we promised you we would open last National Day has now been opened. The flour mill can produce two flours every day, and the flour residue alone is enough to feed twelve pigs. Due to the concentration of funds, we have vigorously applied fertilizer to the fields, and built water conservancy projects and dug nine stone wells, turning 120 mu of dry land into paddy fields. With the improvement of production, our lives have also improved. Now every family regularly eats white flour, fish, and meat, and everyone wears new clothes. Forty-five young people and children are attending school.
    Under your education, the cooperative members' patriotic ideology has improved. This year, our cooperative's crops were all planted according to crop yields and national needs. All of the wheat, except for our own use, has been sold to the state. After the cotton and kenaf are harvested, we will also send them all to the supply and marketing cooperative. We will dry and winnow the best grain and hand it over as patriotic public grain.
    Our agricultural production cooperative has now expanded to 59 member households, with 123 male and female laborers and 746 mu of land. We are determined to complete the autumn patriotic increase production competition plan, support industrial construction, consolidate national defense, and continue to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. For the 362 mu of wheat fields in the cooperative, we require 10 mu of high-yield wheat fields to yield 700 jin per mu, irrigated land to average 400 jin per mu, and dry land to average 250 jin per mu (200 jin per mu for 20 mu of sandy land). We will further overcome the conservative and narrow-minded thinking of the peasants, strengthen collectivism and patriotism, move towards agricultural collectivization, and strive for a happier life.
    All Members of the Lü Hongbin Agricultural Production Cooperative, Patriotic Village, Thirteenth District, Juxian County, Shandong

    保证完成秋季爱国增产计划
    敬爱的毛主席：我们吕鸿宾农业生产合作社全体社员怀着愉快的心情向您报告我们在农业生产上的成就。我们按照您的指示组织起来，生产水平一年比一年提高了。解放前我们每亩地全年只收一百五十四斤粮食。组织互助组后，每亩平均产四百一十五斤粮食。组织了农业生产合作社，庄稼长的更好了。今年小麦每亩平均产二百六十七斤，丰产地达五百斤以上；春玉米平均每亩产一千一百五十九斤，丰产地达一千四百三十多斤。其他晚秋庄稼也长得很旺盛；现在胜利百号地瓜每墩已有四、五斤重，大洋麻长得又粗又高，绿黝黝的真喜人！
    俺社的公共财产一年比一年多了。全社已添置了新式犁三张、解放式水车八部、喷雾器二架、小型喷粉器一架、玉米脱粒机两部、耘锄一张，并买了六头大黄牛、一匹马和六头大驴。去年国庆节，俺向你保证要开的那座粉房，现在已开起来了。粉房每天能出两个粉，仅粉渣就足够喂十二只猪。由于资金集中，我们大力向地里施肥，并兴修水利、打石井九眼，把一百二十亩旱地变成了水田。随着生产的提高，我们生活也改善了。现在家家经常吃白面、鱼肉，人人穿上了新衣服。有四十五个青年和儿童在上学念书。
    在您的教育下，社员的爱国主义思想提高了。俺社今年的庄稼都是根据作物产量及国家需要种植的。小麦除自用外，已全部卖给了国家。棉花、洋麻收下后，我们也要全部送到供销社去。我们将最好的粮食晒干扬净，缴纳爱国公粮。
    我们农业生产合作社现在已扩大到五十九户社员，男女劳动力一百二十三名，土地七百四十六亩。我们决心完成秋季爱国增产竞赛计划，支援工业建设，巩固国防，继续加强抗美援朝工作。全社三百六十二亩麦田，要求十亩小麦丰产田每亩七百斤，水浇地平均每亩四百斤，旱田每亩平均二百五十斤（二十亩沙地每亩二百斤）。我们还要进一步克服农民的保守狭隘思想，加强集体主义与爱国主义思想，向农业集体化方向前进，为争取更幸福的生活而奋斗。
