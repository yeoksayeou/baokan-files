    Heroes, Poets, Rappers
    ——An Account of a Platoon's Trench Rap in a Volunteer Army Unit
    Gong Jiemin
    Not long ago, I went to the front line close to the North Han River and visited the Sixth Platoon of the Ninth Company of a Volunteer Army unit. Comrade Hou Guozhang, the company's political instructor, told me: This platoon, like other platoons, is full of brave and tenacious soldiers, like little tigers, but they also have a prominent feature: everyone can speak, everyone can sing, and they are almost all poets and ballad singers. Comrade Hou Guozhang introduced, "The stranger the sound of enemy planes buzzing in the sky above the position, the happier they are to talk; the more frantically the enemy fires artillery, the louder they sing. Every soldier has a heroic spirit of contempt for the enemy. In such a difficult combat environment, they never know fatigue or depression. If you ask if they are tired? They are sure to change the way to make themselves happy. They named their platoon 'The Always Happy Platoon'."
    As I approached the entrance of the platoon's tunnel, I heard the sound of bamboo clappers. I went inside and saw two soldiers laughing and singing a快板 [kuaiban]. They sang in turns, one after the other:
    "Hammer strikes, drill drills, dig a hole and make a home."
    "The pickaxe is sharpened short, the hammer is broken, the drill is bent, difficulties can't overwhelm heroes, labor transforms nature." The more I listened, the more fascinated I became.
    "The fortifications are built strong and firm, saving ourselves is the key. Killing the enemy and earning merit is certain, worrying 克拉克 [Clark] to death."
    "Hey! Well-built, well-made, like copper walls and iron walls. One row connects to the second row, three platoons connect to the fourth platoon, the left cave connects to the right cave, the front mountain connects to the back mountain, no need to find a guide, no need to ask for directions, you can walk forward even in the dark."
    "The fortifications are so complete, like an underground street. There are warehouses, dormitories, strong and concealed bunkers, upstairs and downstairs like Western-style houses, with a white curtain hanging at the door. On both sides, there is a couplet: The upper line reads: Heroes create hero caves; the lower line reads: Heroes defend the Han River Mountains."
    I couldn't help but praise, "There are really talented people in the Volunteer Army." The two soldiers laughed together, "Comrade, it's not that we sing well, it's that our squad leader writes well." Then we started chatting.
    The sixth platoon leader is a model Communist Party member in the company and also a master of 快板 [kuaiban] and writing 快板 [kuaiban]. Last winter, after the sixth platoon entered the position, the first thing they did was to build fortifications intensively. Now, they have built the position like a copper wall and iron wall. Before starting to dig the tunnel, the platoon leader and deputy platoon leader discussed dividing the whole platoon into two groups according to each person's characteristics and adopting the method of "specialist segment contract system" to carry out the work. Ding ding dong, the work started. At that time, the branch called on "do not do dumb work," and someone in the platoon suggested during work: welcome the platoon leader to take the lead with a 快板 [kuaiban]. The sixth platoon leader did not decline, turned his mind a few times, and came up with a crisp opening shot:
    "Everyone has brought this up, suddenly I thought of a question: this chiseling and opening mountains is like a 比 [bi] (comparison), just like charging to fight back. Find its weaknesses and seize opportunities, the old way will be a waste of effort, when necessary, dig the roots first, tighten the hammer and gather your strength, aim at the cracks and go in, the stone is guaranteed to become mud."
    A section of 快板 [kuaiban] boosted everyone's enthusiasm: "The squad leader's tactical thinking is really clear, sing! One sing has a thousand pounds of strength."
    Then the two groups sang together:
    "You take the hammer and smash, I use the iron chisel to carry."
    "Your pickaxe hoes deep, my small soil cart pulls happily. As long as our will is strong, be diligent and move the mountains."
    Everyone smashed and sang, some shouted: "Wow! Isn't this a singing duel?" With such a fuss, no one felt tired, and in a blink of an eye, it was noon.
    Later, the more they dug, the more large stones there were. A young soldier looked at the stone and said, "This guy is really hard, it leaves a small white spot when you hit it, without a single crack." The squad leader encouraged him and said, "It doesn't matter, I'll help you smash it. Come on, write a 快板 [kuaiban] and smash it, don't be discouraged, think while you work, thinking will make you less tired."
    The young soldier became excited: "Okay, platoon leader, you start us off."
    "Listen - the stone is hard, the stone is hard, continue writing!"
    The young soldier swung three hammers hard, and the words came out: "No matter how hard it is, it can't resist the hammer."
    "Good, good, it's relevant and rhymes, the breakthrough has been opened, continue to develop in depth!"
    The young soldier wrote a few sentences, but couldn't continue for a while, blushing and saying:
    "Oh no, squad leader, it's no good that you praised me, now I'm 'stuck'."
    "Don't panic, calm down, it doesn't matter if you're 'stuck'." The squad leader said three 快板 [kuaiban] sentences, and immediately said: "It doesn't matter, I'll troubleshoot this for you, listen - what about over time, hurry up!"
    "Got it, got it" The young soldier immediately said: "There's no problem in hitting a big hole." This made the other soldiers laugh. The young soldier looked at the squad leader happily: "I don't know what happened, squad leader, when you talk and laugh with me, my energy rises involuntarily." In fact, the little guy's palms were already full of blisters, and he forgot the pain when he laughed.
    In early May this year, they dug to the hardest part of the stone, and enemy planes kept coming to bomb. When the work was tense, the squad leader sang a 插曲 [chaqu] (interlude) of Wang Xiuluan pulling the plow. After singing, he asked everyone: "Difficulties can't overwhelm Wang Xiuluan, can they overwhelm the Volunteer Army?"
    "No!" Everyone answered in unison.
    "If it can't be overwhelmed, work harder and strive to complete the work early to commemorate Red May."
    "Yes, respond to our 'platoon political commissar's' call."
    Under the platoon leader's encouragement, the Party members and League members sang while working, the more they sang, the more energetic they became:
    "Dig, dig, dig, work, work, work, the branch thinks of a way for us, not afraid that the difficulties are as big as mountains, save explosives and use pickaxes to dig. Stones are not as strong as our determination, dig a left cave connecting to the right cave, dig a front mountain connecting to the back mountain."
    Later, there were more big stones, and the platoon leader pointed to the big stones and gave everyone a topic: "Hey, who can make a paragraph about these big blocks, so that everyone is satisfied, I will take the best things as prizes."
    A Sichuan soldier was the first to write a song. He pointed to the big stone and sang:
    "This big stone is like Taiwan, and it's like Truman's dog face,妄想 [wangxiang] (Vainly attempting) to dominate the whole world, it's like a toad without hair can't fly to the sky. First smash its teeth, then smash its eyes, and finally give it one hammer, two hammers, and three hammers in a row,歼 [jian] (annihilate) it piece by piece, the method of individually breaking through is good, and smash its bloody claws."
    After he finished speaking, another Hubei soldier immediately answered:
    "I'll talk about this big block, it's like 李承晚 [Li Chengwans]'s (Syngman Rhee's) the back of the head, knock his bones to pieces and his brains flow all over the ground, see if he submits to me or not."
    After speaking, everyone was satisfied. The platoon leader took out two boxes of cigarettes that the division leader and the people of the motherland had given him to comfort him as prizes, and everyone smoked happily.
    Once, an enemy shell landed on one side of the tunnel entrance. The flying dirt splashed on the soldiers. Someone said, "Do ours, ignore him." A young soldier tilted his head: "Ignore him? That's too cheap for him." The squad leader said, "Yes, pay attention to him, let's have a 快板 [kuaiban] to despise him." The little guy was happy for a while, and the words came out particularly fast. He wrote and sang at the same time:
    "The squad leader is right, hit him - the American cannonball goes out of the muzzle, and lands at the entrance of my tunnel. It's all in vain if you fire a hundred thousand rounds, you can't touch a single hair of mine. When my Volunteer Army's artillery speaks, it will make you speechless and unable to escape."
    After their fortifications were completed, everyone expressed their determination to kill the enemy and earn merit at the platoon's entertainment evening. Finally, someone proposed to ask the platoon leader for a couplet, and the platoon leader thought for a moment and answered on the spot: "The Korean War has not been completely won; we must consolidate the idea of protracted warfare." The young soldier said with great interest: "I'll add a horizontal inscription - always optimistic." As soon as the couplet was written, the company commander came to the platoon and instructed everyone to pay attention to maintaining the solidity and durability of the fortifications. Everyone immediately said this 快板 [kuaiban] according to the leader's intention:
    "The position is our home, strengthen and consolidate and cherish it. Repair it as soon as it is damaged, rely on everyone, check it diligently day and night. Can't let it go wrong, guarantee no leakage and no collapse. If the enemy dares to harass, a burst of guns and artillery will kill him."

    英雄，诗人，说唱家
    ——记志愿军某部一个班的阵地说唱
    宫洁民
    不久以前，我到了紧靠北汉江的前沿阵地，访问了志愿军某部九连第六班。连政治指导员侯国章同志向我说：这个班和其他班一样，每个战士都像小老虎似地英勇顽强，但他们还有一个突出的特点：人人会说、个个能唱，差不离都是诗人兼快板家。侯国章同志介绍道：“敌机越怪声怪气地在阵地上空嗡吱，他们就说得越欢；敌人越疯狂地打炮，他们就唱得越响。每个战士都有蔑视敌人的英雄气概。他们在这样艰苦的战斗环境里，从来不知道疲劳和苦闷。你说累吗？他非变着法使自己乐不行。他们给自己班取名叫‘常乐班’。”
    一走近这个班的坑道口，就听到一阵打竹板的声音。我进去一看，原来两个战士正在笑着唱快板。两人你一段我一段地唱：
    “锤子打来钻子钻，挖好洞子把家安。”
    “铁镐磨完铣磨短，锤子打烂钻子弯，困难压不倒英雄汉，劳动改造大自然。”我越听越入迷。
    “工事修盖得牢又坚，保存自己有本钱。杀敌立功有把握，活活愁死克拉克。”
    “哎！修得好，盖得好，铜墙铁壁一样般。一排接二排，三班接四班，左洞通右洞，前山连后山，甭去找向导，甭去问路线，摸黑也能走上前。”
    “工事修得真齐全，好像地下一条街。有仓库，有宿舍，明堡暗堡火力点，楼上楼下像洋房，门口挂着个白门帘。两边还有一副对，上联写：英雄创造英雄洞；下联写：英雄守卫汉江山。”
    我不由得称赞了一句：“志愿军里真是有能人。”两个战士听了一齐笑起来：“同志，不是俺们唱得好，是俺们班长编得好。”随后我们就聊起天来。
    六班长是连里的模范共产党员，也是说快板和编快板的能手。去年冬季，六班进入阵地后，首先就是紧张地构筑工事。现在，他们已经把阵地筑得像铜墙铁壁一般了。当开始挖坑道前，班长和副班长商量了一下，把全班人按每人的特点编成两个组，采取了“专人专段包干制”的方法进行工作。叮叮当当地开工了。当时支部号召“不要干哑巴活”，班里有人在工作时提议：欢迎班长带个头，来一段快板。六班长没有推脱，脑子里转几转，就来了个干脆利落的开门炮：
    “大伙这么一提，忽然想起一个问题：这凿洞开山好有一比，好比冲锋打反击。找它的弱点抓战机，老一套办法白费力，必要的时候先挖根，攒紧了铁锤运足了气，照准裂缝掏进去，石头保险成了稀泥。”
    一段快板就把大伙的劲头提了起来：“班长的战术思想真明确，唱哪！一唱千斤力。”
    接着两个小组就合着劲唱起来：
    “你拿铁锤砸，我用铁铣端。”
    “你那铁镐锄得深，我这小土车拉得欢。只要咱们意志坚，勤来勤去搬倒山。”
    大伙边砸边唱，有的嚷起来：“好哇！这不成了唱对台戏了吗。”这么一闹，谁也不觉累，一转眼就干到了中午。
    后来，越挖大石块越多。一个小战士望着石头说：“这家伙真硬，砸一下印上一个小白点，没一点裂纹。”班长鼓着劲对他说：“没关系，我帮助你砸掉它。来，编首快板砸，别泄气，一边想一边干，想着想着就不累咧。”
    小战士兴奋起来了：“可以，班长，你给咱起个头。”
    “听着——石头硬，石头硬，往下编吧！”
    小战士使劲抡了三锤，词就出来了：“多硬也格不住铁锤碰。”
    “好好，又贴题又押韵，突破口算是打开咧，继续往纵深发展吧！”
    小战士编了几句，一时编不下去了，红着脸说：
    “糟了，班长，你这一夸不要紧，闹得我给‘卡壳’咧。”
    “别发慌，沉住了气，‘卡’了‘壳’也没关系。”班长说了三句快板，马上又道白：“不碍事，我给你排除这故障，听着——天长日久怎么样，快说！”
    “有了有了”小战士一下就说了出来：“碰个大洞不成问题。”逗得旁的战士也都嘻嘻哈哈乐起来了。小战士高兴地望着班长：“不知怎么闹的，班长，你陪着我一说一笑的，不由得劲头就上来咧。”其实呢，小家伙手掌上早打满了血泡，这一乐也忘了疼。
    今年五月初，挖到了石头最硬的地方，敌机又不断来轰炸。正在工作紧张的时候，班长就唱了一段王秀鸾拉犁的插曲。唱完后问大家：“困难压不倒王秀鸾，压倒志愿军了不哇？”
    “压不倒！”大家一致回答。
    “压不倒加把劲，争取早日完工，纪念红五月。”
    “对，响应咱们‘班政委’的号召。”
    在班长的鼓动下，党团员们一面工作一面唱，越唱越有劲：
    “挖挖挖，干干干，支部给我们想办法，不怕它困难大如山，节省炸药用镐掏。石头不如我们的决心坚，挖他个左洞连右洞，掏它个前山连后山。”
    后来大石头更多了，班长指着一块块的大石头向大家出题目：“哎，谁能把这些个大块编一段，说得大伙全满意，我拿最好的东西做奖品。”
    一个四川战士首先编了一首。他指着大石头唱道：
    “这块大石头像台湾，又好比杜鲁门的狗头脸，妄想霸占全世界，等于蛤蟆没毛不能飞上天。首先砸掉它的牙，然后砸瞎他的眼，最后给他个一锤二锤连三锤，一块一块把它歼，个个击破的办法好，把它的血爪来砸断。”
    这个说完，另一个湖北战士马上又接了声：
    “这个大块我来说，好比李承晚的后脑壳，敲他个骨头粉碎脑浆满地流，看他服我不服我。”
    说完，大伙全满意了。班长拿出师首长和祖国人民慰劳他的两盒香烟做了奖品，抽得大伙都笑迷迷的。
    有一次，一颗敌人炮弹落在坑道口的一边。飞起的泥土溅到了战士们身上。有人说：“干咱们的，不理他。”小战士把头一歪：“不理他？那么便宜他还行。”班长说：“对，理理他，来段快板蔑视他一下。”小家伙一阵子高兴，词也格外出来得快。他随编随唱：
    “班长说得好，打击打击他——美国的炮弹出炮口，落在老子的坑道口。你打十万发也是白费，碰不到老子的一根汗毛。等到我志愿军大炮来发言，叫你哑口无声逃不掉。”
    他们的工事修好以后，在班的娱乐晚会上，大伙都表示了杀敌立功的决心。最后有人提出让班长来副对联，班长稍加考虑，就当场作了回答：“朝鲜战争还没彻底胜利；必须巩固持久作战思想。”小战士兴致勃勃地说：“我来凑上个横批——永远乐观。”对联刚编完，连长到班里来了，指示大家要注意保持工事的坚固和持久。大伙立时按照领导意图，说了这样一段快板：
    “阵地就是咱的家，加修加固爱护它。随坏随修靠大伙，黑天白日勤检查。不能让它出毛病，保证不漏又不塌。敌人胆敢来骚扰，一阵枪炮揍死它。”
