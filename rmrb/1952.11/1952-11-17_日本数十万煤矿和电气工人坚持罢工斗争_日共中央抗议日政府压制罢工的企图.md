Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th: News: Hundreds of thousands of Japanese coal miners and electrical industry workers are persisting in a strike struggle, demanding wage increases from the capitalists.

The strike, which began on October 17th, led by workers from sixteen major coal mining companies, has now developed into a general strike of coal miners. All members of the Japan Coal Miners' Union, approximately 270,000 people, unanimously joined the indefinite strike on the 11th. According to United Press, due to the coal miners' strike, Japan's coal production is losing 122,000 tons per day, nearly 80 percent of Japan's national daily coal production. As of the 12th, the coal miners' strike has cost Japan 2.5 million tons of coal.

At the same time, 120,000 electrical industry workers, after holding their eighth strike on the 7th, implemented a four-hour power outage strike again on the 12th. The main targets of the power outage are large factories that use more than 500 kilowatts of electricity. The Electrical Industry Workers' Union has ordered its affiliated unions across the country to hold another four consecutive days of power outage strikes from the 17th to achieve the goal of increasing wages.

The just struggle of coal miners and electrical industry workers to improve their lives has received widespread support and sympathy from the working class of all countries. Schröder, Secretary-General of the Coal Miners' International of the World Federation of Trade Unions, recently wrote to Japanese coal miners, representing the four million members participating in the Coal Miners' International, to pay tribute to the Japanese coal miners and wish them victory in their struggle to increase wages.

Xinhua News Agency, 14th: According to TASS, Tokyo, 13th: Electrical workers demanding wage increases began their ninth strike on the 12th. The power supply to 700 large Japanese enterprises was therefore interrupted. This strike will continue until the 13th. The All-Japan Electrical Industry Workers' Union has decided to call for a tenth strike lasting four days, starting on November 17th.

"Mainichi Shimbun" reported that the Ministry of Labor's spokesperson, Kakurai Saijiro, said in the Diet on the 11th that the Japanese government is prepared to issue an order prohibiting the tenth strike by electrical workers.

"Akahata" reported that the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement calling on all workers to support the strike of electrical workers and protesting against the government's attempt to suppress the strike.

    【新华社十三日讯】东京消息：数十万日本煤矿工人和电气产业工人坚持进行罢工斗争，要求资方增加工资。
    从十月十七日开始由十六家主要煤矿公司的工人带头举行的罢工，现已发展成为煤矿工人总罢工。日本煤矿工会的全体会员约二十七万人，在十一日一致参加了无限期罢工。据合众社说，由于煤矿工人的罢工，日本煤矿的产量每天损失达十二万二千吨，将近日本全国每天产煤量的百分之八十。至十二日为止，煤矿工人的罢工已使日本损失煤二百五十万吨。
    同时，十二万名电气产业工人继七日举行了第八次罢工以后，在十二日又实行了四小时的停电罢工。停电的主要对象是使用电力在五百瓩以上的大工厂。电气产业工会已命令所属全国各工会，从十七日起再连续举行四天停电罢工，以达到增加工资的目的。
    煤矿工人和电气产业工人为改善生活而进行的正义斗争，得到各国工人阶级的广泛支持和同情。世界工会联合会煤矿国际总书记施洛德最近写信给日本煤矿工人，代表参加煤矿国际的四百万会员向日本煤矿工人致敬，并祝他们在增加工资的斗争中获得胜利。
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社东京十三日讯：要求增加工资的电气工人在十二日开始了第九次的罢工。日本七百家大企业的电力供应因此停顿。这次罢工将继续到十三日。全日本电气产业工会已决定号召从十一月十七日开始为期四天的第十次罢工。
    “每日新闻”报道，劳动省的发言人贺来才二郎十一日在国会上说：日本政府已预备发布一项命令，禁止电气工人的第十次罢工。
    “赤旗报”报道，日本共产党的中央机构发表了一项声明，号召所有的工人支持电气工人的罢工，并对政府压制罢工的企图提出抗议。
