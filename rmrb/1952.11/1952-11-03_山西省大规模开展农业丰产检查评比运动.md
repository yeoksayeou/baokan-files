Shanxi Province Launches Large-Scale Agricultural 丰产 Inspection and Appraisal Campaign
By our Special Correspondent 武光汤

    In order to systematically summarize the achievements and advanced 丰产 experiences of the patriotic 丰产 emulation campaign on the agricultural production front over the past year, and to conduct 丰产 education for the broad masses of farmers, Shanxi Province organized an unprecedented province-wide inspection and appraisal campaign in early September. Approximately 15,000 cadres at the district level and above, village cadres, and labor models participated in this campaign. After about a month, the inspection and appraisal campaign has been widely launched. In the appraisal campaign, the leading organs have gained a preliminary understanding of the province's 丰产 models and 丰产 achievements, and are helping the masses summarize new creations and advanced experiences. According to inspection reports from thirty counties including Pingshun, Licheng, Xiyang, Xinjiang, and Guoxian, 5,967 units in this year's autumn crops meet the agricultural 丰产 reward standards stipulated by the Central Ministry of Agriculture and the province. Among them, there are 96 丰产 villages, and 174 丰产 teams and cooperatives with grain harvests of over 1,000 jin per mu. Some regions have also created large-scale 丰产 land records in larger areas. According to preliminary statistics from Pingshun County: 11 agricultural production cooperatives and 491 mutual aid teams have reached the reward standards stipulated by the Central Ministry of Agriculture. 320 mutual aid teams have reached the reward standards stipulated by the Shanxi Provincial People's Government (the yield standard is the same as that stipulated by the Central Ministry of Agriculture, only the number of 丰产 mu is lower than that stipulated by the Central Ministry of Agriculture). In addition, there are 581 丰产 households (including individual 丰产 mutual aid team members), 32 丰产 villages, and 1,435 丰产 models. It is estimated that there are more than 10,000 units throughout the province that meet the 丰产 reward standards stipulated by the Central Ministry of Agriculture and the province. The emergence of a large number of 丰产 models and new records of high 丰产 yields is of great significance for universally establishing the banner of 丰产 and overcoming the conservative thinking of farmers who believe that "production has reached its peak."

    Combined Top-Down Inspection Teams, Inter-District Inspections

    In order to make the inspection and appraisal campaign a movement to learn from each other's strengths, teach each other, and pass on advanced experiences, to transform the inspection and appraisal process into a process of summarizing and promoting advanced experiences, and to further overcome the imbalance in the 丰产 movement, Shanxi adopted the method of combining top-down inspection teams and conducting inter-district inspections this year. The inspection teams are divided into three levels: First, joint inspection teams from the province and districts. The province will dispatch 320 cadres, each district will dispatch 40 cadres, and each county will dispatch 5 cadres to form five joint inspection teams to work in five districts. The cadres dispatched by each district and county, in addition to retaining a portion to participate in the inspection of their own district, the remaining portion will be sent to other districts to participate in the inspection. The inspection teams are divided into several groups, and each county will have a group to work. The focus of the inspection is on the units that have challenged and responded to challenges across the country and the province this year, as well as the more outstanding 丰产 villages, teams, and cooperatives. Second, joint inspection teams from counties and districts. Each inspection team has 30 to 50 cadres from counties and districts, and also absorbs some village cadres and labor models. The county is the basic unit for appraisal and inspection. Each county inspection team must grasp the overall 丰产 situation of the county, and on the basis of this inspection and appraisal, convene a county-wide 丰产 model representative conference. Third, village inspection and appraisal committees with the participation of county and district cadres lead the mass inspection and appraisal work. The facts of the past month have proved that the method of combining top-down and cross-inspection is a good method for summarizing and exchanging experiences and promoting the movement.

    Enhance the Masses' Ideological Awareness of Patriotic 丰产 in the Appraisal Movement

    All localities attach great importance to propaganda, education, and ideological mobilization in the inspection and appraisal movement. Members of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and district committee members personally delivered mobilization reports for the provincial and district inspection teams, and studied relevant inspection and appraisal documents. The mobilization work in the counties was carried out more extensively. Twenty-five counties including Guoxian, Linjin, Pingshun, and Licheng convened enlarged cadre meetings of 1,000 to 2,000 people; Gaoping, Jiexiu, Yushe, and other counties also convened people's representative conferences, mutual aid representative conferences, and propagandist representative conferences to carry out mobilization and deployment. Blackboards, broadcasting tubes, and other forms of propaganda were widely used in rural areas to deeply publicize the content and significance of inspection and appraisal. The inspection team of Xinyi Village in the seventh district of Wu乡 first used various methods to understand the ideological situation of the masses, then convened a joint meeting of the Party and Communist Youth League branches to explain the significance of inspection and appraisal; and then deeply publicized the 丰产 reward methods to the masses, helped the masses democratically elect an inspection and appraisal committee, and organized 21 丰产 models and mutual aid representatives to conduct actual inspections. They then took the results of the inspection to the masses for deliberation and discussion, thus forming a mass appraisal movement.

    Make the Inspection and Appraisal Team a Propaganda Team for Promoting Advanced Experience

    In order to combine inspection and appraisal with the promotion of advanced 丰产 experience, the inspection team should not only become an inspection team, but also become an advanced experience propaganda team. All personnel participating in the inspection team should not only educate the masses with local experience, but also introduce the experience of other regions in light of local conditions to educate the local masses. In this way, the inspection and appraisal movement becomes a large movement for imparting advanced experience. Inspection teams in various localities used propagandists, transmission stations, observation meetings, transmission meetings, seminars, and report meetings to widely publicize advanced experience. In the inspection and appraisal, each district selected more than a dozen village cadres and labor models to visit other districts, which also played a great role in spreading advanced experience. Counties also organized farmers to observe each other over short distances. It is estimated that one million people throughout the province will receive education in cooperative mutual assistance and 丰产 technology in this observation movement. Representatives of Yuncheng labor models visited the agricultural production cooperatives in Xigou Village and Chuandi Village in Pingshun, and saw with their own eyes the fact that 丰产 can be achieved even in mountainous areas with poor production conditions. They said that this was a political lesson and a technical lesson, and they completely believed in the scientific truth that "there is no bad land, only bad farming methods." At present, various localities are continuing to organize farmers to visit. However, some areas do not pay enough attention to this point, so that advanced experience has not been effectively promoted. The leading organs are now correcting this deviation.

    On-Site Inspection, Democratic Appraisal

    In the inspection and appraisal movement, the methods of on-site inspection and democratic appraisal should be implemented. The content of inspection and appraisal is: compare patriotism, compare mutual assistance, compare technology, compare crops, compare harvests. Generally, several steps are taken, including listening to reports, observing on-site, and conducting seminars and research (the masses say: "Listen first, then look, then improve."), and finally, 丰产 models are selected through democratic appraisal. The masses are very serious about the appraisal movement. Because on-site inspection and democratic appraisal are emphasized, the enthusiasm of the masses for inspection and appraisal has been further enhanced, and false reports caused by bureaucracy have also been prevented. In the inspection, the method of combining general survey and mutual comparison with key inspection was adopted, and typical examples were used to promote the overall situation. Fencheng, Yuanqu, Taigu, Gaoping and other counties adopted the method of gradually developing from point to surface. Yushe first concentrated the inspection personnel in Dazhai Village for inspection, obtained experience, and then went to various villages for general inspection. These are all very good experiences.

    The Inspection and Appraisal Movement Promoted the Work of Autumn Harvest, Autumn Planting, and Autumn Cultivation

    The inspection and appraisal work was carried out in the autumn harvest season. The inspection teams in various localities paid attention to the problem of closely combining inspection and appraisal with the three autumn tasks. Before the start of the inspection work, the inspection team first helped various localities deploy the autumn production emulation work, dispelled the ideological concerns of some cadres who were afraid that the inspection and appraisal would delay the three autumn tasks, and all localities achieved the goal of promoting the three autumn tasks with the appraisal work. Therefore, the province's autumn harvest, wheat planting, autumn cultivation, fertilizer accumulation, and other tasks have all achieved better results. 18 million mu of wheat fields have been sown in a timely manner. The promotion of advanced experience in dense planting of wheat has been very effective. In old areas such as Changzhi, 30% to 40% of wheat fields are densely planted. The autumn harvest has also been completed on time, and most areas have achieved the mutual combination of autumn harvest and autumn cultivation. At present, various localities are still combining inspection and appraisal to vigorously launch autumn cultivation and fertilizer accumulation work.

    山西省大规模开展农业丰产检查评比运动
    本报特约记者  武光汤
    山西省为了系统地总结一年来农业生产战线上爱国丰产竞赛运动的成就和先进丰产经验，对广大农民进行丰产教育，在九月上旬组织了空前规模的全省范围的检查评比运动。全省约有一万五千个区级以上干部、村干部及劳动模范参加了这个运动。经过约一个月的时间，检查评比运动已经广泛地发动起来。领导机关在评比运动中已对全省丰产模范和丰产成绩有了初步的了解，并在帮助群众总结新的创造和先进经验。据平顺、黎城、昔阳、新绛、崞县等三十个县的检查报告，本年秋季作物合于中央农业部及本省规定之农业丰产奖励标准者有五千九百六十七个单位。其中有丰产村九十六个，每亩收获粮食千斤以上的丰产组、社一百七十四个。若干地区并在较大面积内创造了较大面积的丰产地纪录。据平顺县初步统计：达到中央农业部规定之奖励标准者有十一个农业生产合作社、四百九十一个互助组。达到山西省人民政府奖励标准者（产量标准与中央农业部的规定相同，仅丰产亩数较中央农业部规定为低）有三百二十个互助组。此外并有五百八十一个丰产户（互助组员个人丰产者在内），三十二个丰产村，一千四百三十五个丰产模范。估计全省合于中央农业部及本省规定丰产奖励标准者约在一万个单位以上。大量的丰产模范与高额丰产新纪录的出现，对于普遍树立丰产旗帜，克服农民“生产到顶”的保守思想有极重大的意义。
    上下结合组成检查团，各专区互相检查
    为了使检查评比运动成为一个取长补短、互教互学、传授先进经验的运动，把检查评比的过程变成总结与推广先进经验的过程，进一步克服丰产运动的不平衡现象，今年山西采取了上下结合组成检查团，使各专区互相检查的办法。检查团共分三级：一是省和专区的联合检查团。由省抽调干部三百二十名，每个专区抽调干部四十名，每县抽调干部五名，共同组成五个联合检查团，分赴五个专区工作。各专区和县抽调的干部，除留一部分参加本专区的检查外，其余一部派往其他专区参加检查。检查团下分若干小组，每县都有一组前往工作。检查重点是今年向全国、全省挑战应战的单位及较出色的丰产村、组、社等。二是县区联合检查团。每个检查团有县、区干部三十人至五十人，并吸收一部分村干部、劳动模范参加。县为评比检查的基本单位，各县检查团必须掌握全县丰产情况，并在这次检查评比的基础上，召开全县丰产模范代表大会。三是有县、区干部参加的村的检查评比委员会，领导群众性的检查评比工作。一个月来的事实证明，上下结合、交叉检查的方法，是总结与交流经验，推动运动的好的方法。
    在评比运动中提高群众爱国丰产的思想觉悟
    各地在检查评比运动中都很重视宣传教育和思想发动。省和专区检查团由中共山西省委委员、地委委员亲自作了动员报告，并学习了有关检查评比的文件。各县的动员工作进行得更加广泛。崞县、临晋、平顺、黎城等二十五县都召开了一千人至二千人的扩大干部会议；高平、介休、榆社等县并召开了各界人民代表会、互助代表会、宣传员代表会等，进行动员布置。在农村中广泛地运用了黑板报、广播筒等宣传形式，深入宣传检查评比的内容和意义。武乡七区信义村检查组首先运用各种方法，了解群众的思想情况，接着召开党、团支部联席会议，讲解检查评比的意义；又对群众深入宣传了丰产奖励办法，帮助群众民主选举了检查评比委员会，组织丰产模范和互助代表二十一人进行实际检查。他们又把检查的结果拿到群众中去酝酿讨论，这样就形成了群众性的评比运动。
    使检查评比队成为推广先进经验的宣传队
    为了使检查评比和推广先进丰产经验结合起来，检查团不但应该成为检查队，而且应该成为先进经验宣传队。所有参加检查团的人员，不仅要以当地的经验教育群众，还必须结合当地情况，介绍其他地区的经验，教育当地群众。这样就使检查评比运动成为传授先进经验的大运动。各地检查团运用宣传员、传授站、观摩会、传授会、座谈会、报告会广泛地宣传了先进经验。各地在检查评比中各专区都选派了十多个村干部、劳动模范到其他专区参观，这对传播先进经验，也有很大作用。各县也组织农民，在短距离内相互观摩。预计全省将有一百万人在此次观摩运动中受到合作互助和丰产技术的教育。运城劳动模范代表参观了平顺西沟村、川底村的农业生产合作社，亲眼看到了在生产条件较差的山地也能丰产的事实，他们说，这是上了一次政治课和技术课，完全相信了“没有不良的土地，只有不良的耕作方法”的科学道理。目前各地正在继续组织农民参观。但部分地区对这一点重视不够，以致先进经验未能有效的推广，现在领导机关正在纠正这种偏向。
    现场检查，民主评议
    在检查评比运动中，应该实行现场检查和民主评议的方法。检查评比的内容是：比爱国、比互助、比技术、比庄稼、比收成。一般都经过了听报告、到现场观察、座谈研究等几个步骤（群众的说法是：“先听、后看，再提高。”），最后经过民主评议，选出丰产模范。群众对评比运动都十分认真。因为强调了现场检查和民主评议，更加提高了群众对于检查评比的积极性，也防止了由于官僚主义而产生的假报告。在检查当中又采取了普查互比与重点检查相结合的办法，用典型推动全面。汾城、垣曲、太谷、高平等县采取了由点到面逐步开展的办法。榆社先将检查人员集中在大寨村进行检查，取得经验后，再分头到各村进行普遍检查。这些都是很好的经验。
    检查评比运动推动了秋收、秋种、秋耕工作
    检查评比工作是在秋收季节进行的。各地检查团都注意了使检查评比和三秋工作紧密结合的问题。检查工作开始前，检查团首先帮助各地布置秋季生产竞赛工作，解除了某些干部怕检查评比耽误三秋工作的思想顾虑，各地都做到了以评比工作推动三秋工作，因此，全省秋收、种麦、秋耕、积肥等工作都作出了更好的成绩。一千八百万亩麦田已适时下种。推广小麦密植先进经验很有成效，长治等老区实行密植的麦田可达百分之三十至四十。秋收亦已按时完成，大部地区做到了秋收秋耕相互结合。目前各地仍在结合检查评比，大力发动秋耕和积肥工作。
