    Ridgway Scours Turkey for Cheap Cannon Fodder for the US
    The reactionary Turkish government acts as a loyal lackey of American imperialism.
    On the orders of Washington, the Turkish government sent 18,000 Turkish soldiers to Korea. When the American troops were beaten back from the vicinity of the Chinese border by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, they used Turkish troops as a cover, resulting in 12,000 of the 18,000 Turkish soldiers being killed, wounded, or captured.
    However, the current Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Aggressor Forces, Ridgway, is not satisfied. He wants to drive hundreds of thousands of Turkish soldiers to the killing fields. Turkey's top ruling clique has agreed to Ridgway's plan to establish a special Turkish force to be stationed in France, Greece, and other European countries in the future, using hired Turkish troops to suppress the "restless" people of various European countries. This is the central content of Ridgway's plan, and the main task of the plan to scour for cheap cannon fodder for the United States.

    李奇微在土耳其为美国搜罗廉价炮灰
    土耳其反动政府充当了美帝国主义的忠顺奴仆。
    土耳其政府奉了华盛顿的命令，曾把一万八千个土耳其士兵送到朝鲜去。当美军在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军痛击下从中国边境附近退却的时候，曾经用土耳其军打掩护，结果一万八千名土耳其士兵中就有一万二千人死亡、受伤或者被俘。
    然而现在的北大西洋侵略军总司令李奇微并不满足。他还要把几十万的土耳其兵赶到杀人场去。土耳其的最高统治集团已答应李奇微成立土耳其特别部队，将来分驻法国、希腊和欧洲其他国家，借雇佣的土耳其军的手来镇压欧洲各国“动乱不安”的人民，这就是李奇微计划的中心内容，也就是为美国搜罗廉价炮灰计划的主要任务。
