    Soviet Experts' Advanced Work Experience Breaks Through Conservative Thinking of Technicians
    Editor: The technicians at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant have made great progress with the help of Soviet experts.
    In the past, the technicians at this plant believed that the pig iron output of the blast furnace could not exceed the capacity specified by the original designer, so they did not dare to increase production. Since the Soviet experts taught them coefficient calculation (i.e., calculation by volume) and guided them to boldly increase air supply to increase production, the conservative thinking of the technicians was broken in actual work. With the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, the pig iron output of a certain blast furnace has increased three to four times.
    At the symposium of technicians held by the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant on November 6 to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, engineer Gao Runzhi said: "Although I have received some Anglo-American education and have some practical work experience, since contacting Soviet experts, I deeply feel that everything must be learned from scratch."

    苏联专家的先进工作经验打破技术人员的保守思想
    编辑同志：石景山钢铁厂的技术人员在苏联专家的帮助下，有很大进步。
    过去这个厂的技术人员认为高炉的生铁产量不能超过原设计者所规定的能力，因而不敢提高产量。自从苏联专家告诉他们利用系数计算（即按容积计算）和指导他们大胆加风以提高产量后，在实际工作中打破了技术人员的守旧思想。在苏联专家热心的帮助下，某高炉的生铁产量已提高三倍到四倍。
    在十一月六日石景山钢铁厂庆祝十月社会主义革命三十五周年召开的技术人员座谈会上，工程师高润芝说：“我虽然受过一些英美式的教育，也有些实际工作经验，但自接触苏联专家以后，我深深感到一切必须从头学起。”  徐炳忠
