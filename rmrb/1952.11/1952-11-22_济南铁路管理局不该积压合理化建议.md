    Jinan Railway Administration Should Not Suppress Rationalization Proposals
    To the Editor: The Jinan Railway Administration has been suppressing my rationalization proposal regarding the improvement of brake hoses for a long time.
    I noticed that accidents frequently occur when switchmen disconnect brake hoses on the railway. Therefore, last year I began to research how to automatically disconnect the brake hoses without manual intervention. By the end of last year, I had made preliminary progress. In December, I submitted this proposal to the higher authorities for review. The Rationalization Proposal Committee and the Rolling Stock Section of the Bengbu Railway Sub-bureau both believed that this proposal could be promoted, and it was submitted to the Bengbu Railway Sub-bureau on December 30th. The Bengbu Railway Sub-bureau reported it to the Jinan Railway Administration in January of this year. After the Jinan Railway Administration forwarded it to the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Railways approved it in February, and put forward suggestions for improvement and instructions for further experimentation. However, the Jinan Railway Administration suppressed it for as long as four months. At this time, the Bengbu Railway Sub-bureau improved my experimental product and reported it to the Jinan Railway Administration again in July. The Jinan Railway Administration again waited for another month before reporting it to the Ministry of Railways.
    Therefore, I believe that the Jinan Railway Administration's working style of neglecting rationalization proposals from the masses is very wrong. I hope that the relevant personnel of the bureau will conduct a profound self-criticism. Huang Yuanchang

    济南铁路管理局不该积压合理化建议
    编辑同志：济南铁路管理局长期地积压我提出的关于改进摘风管的合理化建议。
    我看到铁路上的连结员摘风管时，经常发生事故，所以在去年我就开始钻研：把摘风管自动分离开，不用人工去摘。去年年底有了初步成就。十二月我把这建议送请上级审查。蚌埠铁路分局合理化建议委员会和车辆科都认为这个建议可以推广，十二月三十日便提交到蚌埠铁路分局。蚌埠铁路分局于今年一月报送济南铁路管理局。济南铁路管理局转到铁道部后，铁道部在二月即批下来，并提出改进的意见和继续试验的指示。但济南铁路管理局竟把它积压了四个月之久。此时，蚌埠铁路分局将我的试验品加以改进，在七月份又报到济南铁路管理局，济南铁路管理局又隔了一个月之久，才报到铁道部。
    因此，我认为济南铁路管理局这种忽视群众合理化建议的工作作风，是非常不对的。我希望该局有关人员作深刻检讨。  黄远昌
