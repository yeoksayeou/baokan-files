    Introducing Methods for Preventing and Treating "Swine Erysipelas"
    To the Editor: I saw the reader's letter published in the People's Daily on November 12th from farmers in the Jinhua Special District requesting the prevention and treatment of "swine erysipelas," and I know that this swine disease is prevalent there. "Swine erysipelas" has also been prevalent in Laiyang, Huimin, and other special districts in Shandong. Laiyang County suffered from "swine erysipelas" in the spring and summer of this year, and more than 7,700 pigs died in more than three months. These areas have put a lot of effort into eradicating swine diseases, so they have gained some experience in preventing and treating swine diseases. Now, I am providing it for the reference of Jinhua Special District and other places.
    First of all, we should pay attention to the prevention of swine diseases. Laiyang Veterinary Hospital and counties with more pig farming in Huimin Special District attach great importance to this work. Their main methods for preventing swine diseases are to pay attention to the cleanliness and diet of pigs. There is a saying among pig farmers here: "If you want pigs to be healthy, the pigsty must be clean." They often clean the pigsty to keep it dry and drain stagnant water. In terms of the diet of pigs, first, pay attention to the adjustment of feed, so that vegetables and grains account for a certain proportion. Second, do not let pigs eat spoiled things. In order to prevent pigs from contracting diseases, the following points should be made: (1) Once a sick pig is found, immediately isolate it and disinfect the pigpen; (2) Pig farmers should preferably not buy sick pork to eat. If you eat sick pork, do not use the dishwashing water to feed the pigs; people who have eaten sick pork should not defecate in the pigpen; (3) When swine infectious diseases are prevalent, do not let pigs go out; (4) Newly bought pigs must be kept in separate pens for a few days to confirm that they do not have infectious diseases before being put together with the original pigs. Laiyang County used this method to prevent the spread of "swine erysipelas."
    Secondly, correct treatment should be given to sick pigs. It is best to have a veterinarian handle it specifically. Some local methods that have been proven effective in treating swine diseases through mass experiments can also be used. The masses should be dissuaded from using ineffective or even harmful methods, such as cutting the pig's ears and tail and pouring mothballs.
    Thirdly, pig farmers should be properly organized. Rural pig farming is mostly done on a household basis, and inconsistencies in prevention and treatment are prone to occur during disease prevention and control. For example, one household prevents while another does not, one household treats while another does not, sick pigs are released casually, and sick pigs are slaughtered and sold. To prevent this phenomenon, pig farmers should be organized at ordinary times, and covenants should be formulated according to the actual situation. Once swine diseases are prevalent, each pig farmer can carry out prevention and treatment in an organized manner.

### 介绍防治“猪丹毒”的办法

    介绍防治“猪丹毒”的办法
    编辑同志：我看到十一月十二日人民日报刊登的金华专区农民要求防治“猪丹毒”的读者来信，知道这种猪疫病正在那里流行。“猪丹毒”在山东莱阳、惠民等专区也流行过。莱阳县今年春、夏两季闹“猪丹毒”，在三个多月中死了七千七百多只猪。这些地区曾经用很大力量进行扑灭猪疫病的工作，所以摸索到若干防治猪疫病的经验。现在提供出来，供金华专区和其他各地的参考。
    首先应该重视预防猪疫病的工作。莱阳兽医院和惠民专区养猪较多的县份都很重视这件工作。他们预防猪疫病的主要方法是注意猪的清洁和饮食。这里养猪户有句俗话是：“要想猪不病，猪窝得干净。”他们经常打扫猪窝使猪窝干燥，排除积水。在猪的饮食上，第一要注意饲料的调剂，使蔬菜和粮食各占一定的比例。第二不要让猪吃腐败的东西。为了防止猪感染疫病，要作到以下几点：（一）一旦发现病猪，立即实行隔离，并实行猪圈消毒；（二）养猪户最好不要买病猪肉吃。如果吃了病猪肉千万不要把刷锅水喂猪；吃过病猪肉的人，也不要在猪圈里大便；（三）在猪传染病流行时，不要放猪外出；（四）新买来的猪一定要先另圈养几天，证实没有传染病，才和原有的猪合在一起。莱阳县用这种办法，防止了“猪丹毒”的流传。
    其次是对病猪进行正确的治疗。最好是由兽医具体处理。有些经过群众试验治猪疫病确有成效的土法，也可以采用。要劝阻群众不要采用毫无成效、甚至有害的办法，如割破猪耳、猪尾和灌卫生球等。
    再次是对养猪户要加以适当的组织。农村养猪多以户为单位，在防治疫病时容易发生步骤不一致的现象。如这户预防那户不预防，这户治疗那户不治疗，随便放出病猪，杀卖病猪等等。要防止这种现象，就应该在平时把养猪户组织起来，根据实际情况，订出公约，一旦猪疫病流行，各养猪户就可以有组织地进行防治了。    王德荣
