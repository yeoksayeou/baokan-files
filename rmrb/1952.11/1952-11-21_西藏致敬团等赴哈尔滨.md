Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

    The Tibetan Delegation and the Changdu Region Tibetan People's National Day Observation Delegation, after visiting Hailar City in the Hulunbuir League of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, set off on the 16th for Harbin and other places in Northeast China under the leadership of the head of the delegation, Lujia·Tudeng Tabai, and Gesang Wangdui.

    During their visit to Hailar City, the Tibetan Delegation and the Changdu Region Tibetan People's National Day Observation Delegation were warmly welcomed. Lamas presented hadas, yellow satin, and sycee silver to the Dalai Lama, Bainqen Erdini, and the three major monasteries of Tibet as gifts.

    After the visit, the representatives of the two delegations expressed great excitement about the motherland's protection of religion and temples. The head of the delegation, Lujia·Tudeng Tabai, said: "We have seen the Lama temples that were once ravaged by imperialism but are now protected, and we have seen the happy lives of the Inner Mongolian herdsmen where 'both people and livestock are thriving,' and the children studying in spacious school buildings. We deeply feel that only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and by implementing national regional autonomy, can things be like this. We must bring back the rich experiences of Inner Mongolia's construction in all aspects, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao, conscientiously implement the Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet and build Tibet as well as Inner Mongolia."

    西藏致敬团等赴哈尔滨
    据新华社讯：西藏致敬团和昌都地区藏族人民国庆节观礼代表团，在内蒙古自治区呼纳盟海拉尔市参观后，已在团长柳霞·土登塔巴和格桑旺堆率领下，在十六日去东北哈尔滨等地参观。
    西藏致敬团和昌都地区藏族人民国庆节观礼代表团在海拉尔市参观期间，曾受到热烈欢迎，喇嘛们并曾向达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼和西藏三大寺献哈达、黄缎和元宝等礼物。
    在参观后，两团代表对祖国保护宗教和庙宇的情形，深感兴奋。团长柳霞·土登塔巴说：“我们看到过去受帝国主义摧残而今天受到保护的喇嘛庙，看到内蒙古牧民过着‘人畜两旺’的幸福生活和儿童们在宽广的校舍里念书的情形，深感只有在共产党和毛主席的领导下，实行民族区域自治才能如此。我们一定要把内蒙古各方面建设的丰富经验带回去，在毛主席的领导下，认真执行西藏和平解放协议，把西藏建设得和内蒙古一样。”
