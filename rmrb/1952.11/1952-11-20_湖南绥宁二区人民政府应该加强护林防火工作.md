    To the Editor: Some farmers in the second district of Suining often cut down weeds and shrubs from the edges of their fields and burn them in piles not far from the forest. It is right for farmers to clear weeds from the edges of their fields, but this method of clearing poses a great threat to the forest.
    Some of the forest protection organizations here have become mere formalities. According to the forest protection committee members of the fourth village of the second district of Suining, since they established the forest protection committee and forest protection groups, they have never convened a meeting with the masses, and some members of the forest protection groups do not even know who the leader of their group is.
    This area vigorously promoted forest fire prevention and the punishment of arsonists who burn down mountains this spring. The forest fire prevention work in this area has been strengthened somewhat compared to before, but based on the facts mentioned above, the fire prevention work in this area still has problems. I suggest that areas with trees should always pay attention to forest fire prevention.

    湖南绥宁二区人民政府应该加强护林防火工作
    编辑同志：绥宁二区有些农民常常把田边的杂草、灌木砍下来，堆在距离树林不远的地方烧毁了。农民清除田边的杂草是对的，但是这种清除法对森林却是一种很大的威胁。
    这里的护林组织有的已流于形式。据绥宁二区四村的护林委员反映：他们成立起护林委员会和护林小组以后，从没有召集群众开过会，有的护林小组的组员连本组的组长是谁都不知道。
    这个地区在今春曾大力宣传护林防火和惩处纵火烧山的分子。这个地区的护林防火工作比以前加强了一些，但是根据上述的事实来看，这个地区的防火护林工作还是有问题的。我建议有林木的地区，要经常注意护林防火。
