Xinhua News Agency, Jin Hua Front, Korea, 23rd: Our frontline correspondent reports: On the Shangganling battlefield, where fierce fighting continues, the name of light machine gunner Chen Zhiguo is being spread everywhere. In the decisive moment of the battle, this brave warrior used his wounded body as a machine gun firing platform, protecting the lives of his comrades with his own flesh and defeating the enemy's attack.

The one who recounted Chen Zhiguo's heroic deeds to me was Chu Yunjiang, the deputy company commander who fought alongside Chen Zhiguo at the time. He said: "On the first day the enemy launched an offensive against the Shangganling area, they used more than a regiment of troops to attack the forward positions of our second and third platoons. But the enemy fought from five in the morning until three in the afternoon, and although they suffered heavy casualties, they still couldn't climb our forward position. Later, the enemy's 'supervisory team' desperately drove their soldiers up in batches. At this time, the enemy set up a heavy machine gun in a depression on the hillside, firing at the soldiers in our forward squad. The dense bullets hit our forward fortifications, and if we didn't immediately take out that machine gun, the enemy might very well rush the position."

The deputy company commander said: "At this time, Comrade Chen Zhiguo, the light machine gunner, was next to me, and he was also anxiously holding his machine gun and firing at the depression. The hot barrel of his gun burned his hand, but he gritted his teeth and kept firing, but he could never hit the enemy's heavy machine gun. I was anxious, so I took his machine gun and fired it myself, but after firing for a while, I still didn't hit it. The reason was that our machine gun firing platform had been destroyed in the battle, and without it, it was difficult to hit the enemy in the depression. At this time, the enemy's machine gun was still wreaking havoc, and when the soldiers in the forward fortifications stood up to shoot at the charging enemy, two more were hit by this heavy machine gun. The situation was very urgent, we had to eliminate the enemy's heavy machine gun!"

Speaking to this point, the deputy company commander said with激动(excitement): "At that time, Chen Zhiguo saw clearly that he could not tolerate this situation continuing, he could not bear to let his class brothers and close comrades be sacrificed again, he suddenly jumped onto the destroyed machine gun firing platform, put the frame of the machine gun on his shoulders, and used his body as the machine gun firing position. At this time, the enemy's machine gun bullets were 'whizzing' and 'whizzing', I said: 'Let's think of other ways to fight. Chen Zhiguo, good comrade, I can't let you...' But Chen Zhiguo squeezed out a steel-like sentence from between his teeth: 'Deputy company commander, fire quickly, the forward squad can't raise their heads!' I knew that he was enduring the pain, he was already wounded. What else was there to say? I could only pull the trigger and fire fiercely at the enemy's heavy machine gun in the depression."

The deputy company commander continued with an excited but also regretful mood: "With a series of bursts, the enemy's machine gun was destroyed. Our soldiers immediately straightened up from the fortifications and fired a burst of submachine guns and grenades at the enemy, killing and wounding a large number of the enemy who were climbing the slope without fire support, and driving the enemy down the mountain. At this time, I turned to look at our Comrade Chen Zhiguo, his hands were still tightly gripping the machine gun frame, his eyes were full of hatred, glaring at the depression in front, several places on his chest were bleeding... I will never forget this brave warrior!"

The deputy company commander finally said: "At that time, all the soldiers on the position were moved by Chen Zhiguo's heroic deeds, they silently and quickly returned to their battle positions. There was only one sentence in everyone's heart: 'Avenge Comrade Chen Zhiguo, and never let the enemy gain a foothold in front of us!'"

    上甘岭前线志愿军机枪射手
    陈治国英勇舍身掩护战友打败敌人
    【新华社朝鲜金化前线二十三日电】本社前线通讯员报道：仍在进行着激烈战斗的上甘岭战场上，到处传颂着轻机关枪射手陈治国的名字。这个骁勇的战士在战斗的决定关头把自己负伤的身体当作机关枪的射击台，用自己的肉体保护了战友们的生命并击败了敌人的进攻。
    向我叙述陈治国英雄事迹的是当时和陈治国在一起战斗的副连长楚云江。他说：“敌人向上甘岭附近地区发动进攻的第一天，就用一个多团的兵力向我们第二排和第三排的前沿阵地进攻。但敌人从早上五点一直打到下午三点，虽然死伤了一大堆，还是爬不上我们这个前沿阵地。后来敌人的‘督战队’拚命把他们的士兵一批又一批地往上赶。这时候，敌人在山坡的一个洼坑里架起了一挺重机枪，朝着我们前沿班的战士扫射。密密麻麻的子弹打在我们的前沿工事上，如果不立即干掉那挺机枪，敌人很可能冲上阵地。”
    副连长说：“这时在我身旁的就是轻机关枪射手陈治国同志，他也着急地端着机枪向洼地一个劲地打。他打得发热的枪筒烫痛了手，还是咬着牙猛打，但是总是打不到敌人的那挺重机枪。我心里一急，把他的机枪接过来自己打，但打了一阵还是没打中。原因是我们的机枪射击台已在战斗中被打毁了，没有它很难打到洼地里的敌人。这时敌人的机枪正在继续逞凶，前沿工事里的战士挺起身来向冲锋的敌人射击时，又被这挺重机枪打着了两个。时机十分紧迫，我们必须消灭敌人这挺重机枪！”
    谈到这里，副连长用激动的语句说：“当时陈治国看得清楚，他不能容忍这种情况继续下去，他不忍心让自己的阶级弟兄、亲密战友再遭到牺牲，他突然跳上了被打坏的机枪射击台，把机枪的架子架在自己的肩上，用自己的身体当作机关枪的射击工事。这时敌人的机枪子弹正在‘哧溜’‘哧溜’地响着，我说：‘我们想别的办法打吧。陈治国，好同志，我不能让你……。’可是，陈治国从牙缝里挤出了一句钢铁般的话：‘副连长快打，前沿班抬不起头来呀！’我知道，他在忍着疼痛，他已经负伤了。还有什么好说呢？我只有抅住扳机朝洼地里的那挺敌人的重机枪狠狠地发射。”
    副连长怀着兴奋的但又是痛惜的心情继续说：“一连几梭子，就把那挺敌人的机枪打毁了。我们的战士马上从工事里挺起腰来，狠狠地向敌人打了一阵冲锋枪和手榴弹，把爬在坡上失掉火力掩护的敌人杀伤了一大批，并且把敌人赶下山去。这时，我回头看我们的陈治国同志，他的双手还紧紧抓住机枪架子，他两眼充满着仇恨，瞪视着前面的洼地，他的胸脯上好几个地方冒着鲜血………我永远也不会忘记这个勇敢的战士！”
    副连长最后说：“当时阵地上所有的战士都被陈治国的英雄事迹所感动，他们沉默地、迅速地回到自己的战斗岗位上。每个人的心里只有一句话：‘为陈治国同志报仇，决不让敌人在我们面前立足！’”
