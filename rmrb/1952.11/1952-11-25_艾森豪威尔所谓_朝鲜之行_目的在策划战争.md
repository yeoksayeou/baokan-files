Title: Eisenhower's So-Called "Korean Trip" Aimed at Planning War

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 24th: Dwight D. Eisenhower, the next U.S. president who used the promise of "ending the Korean War" to win a majority of the votes, is reportedly going to Korea soon for an "inspection," according to U.S. news agencies. The U.S. Department of Defense issued a solemn statement on the 20th, saying it would maintain complete secrecy regarding Eisenhower's trip to Korea. This is actually an attempt to cover up Eisenhower's true purpose in coming to Korea with a black curtain of news blockade.

When the ugly drama of the U.S. presidential election reached its climax, Eisenhower "dramatically" claimed that he would personally go to Korea to find a way to end the Korean War as soon as possible, in order to cater to the American people's desire for an armistice. U.S. newspapers even spread the news that if Eisenhower were elected on November 4th, he would set off for Korea on November 6th.

In fact, a way out of the Korean War has long existed. There is only one way out. The entire armistice agreement has been agreed upon, and even the written details are ready. As long as the U.S. side abandons its insistence on detaining prisoners of war, a ceasefire can be signed immediately, allowing the prisoners of war to go home for Christmas and ending the thousands of casualties suffered by American soldiers every week. Apart from this, the United States only has a dead end in Korea, leading to greater defeat. However, Eisenhower is clearly not interested in a way out that could truly lead to an immediate armistice. His spokesmen have repeatedly stated that he will adhere to the unreasonable principle of so-called "no forced repatriation of prisoners of war" and continue to close the door to a ceasefire. The Associated Press also released information on the 21st, saying that Eisenhower and his future Secretary of State Dulles "doubt whether it is possible to reach an agreement with the Communists in Korea," and that Dulles "takes a pessimistic view" of the possibility of a Korean armistice.

It is very clear that Eisenhower's coming to Korea to feign searching for a "way out" is actually to plan how to continue and expand the war of aggression against Korea so that Wall Street bosses can obtain more profits. As early as November 7th, the U.S. "Wall Street Journal" revealed that the mission of Eisenhower's trip to Korea was to "recommend some military measures, such as accelerating the training of Korean troops, accelerating the transportation of equipment, intensifying the air war, adopting new amphibious landing methods, and strengthening tank and artillery operations, etc." An Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 21st reported that "well-informed sources" in Washington believed that Eisenhower's visit to Korea "will mainly study the military aspects of the Korean issue." In addition, he "will also examine the possibility of ordering an offensive next spring." In addition to strengthening the already bankrupt "military pressure," Eisenhower is also preparing to take the opportunity to pressure other countries to send troops. The U.S. "Business Week" revealed on November 8th that Eisenhower will demand even more forcefully than Truman that so-called "allies" "shoulder greater responsibility" in the war. U.S. Senator Stennis also said on the 20th that the "basic effect" of Eisenhower's trip to Korea is "to prompt all countries to share the burden of the Korean War more fairly." U.S. Republican Senator Smith declared on the 21st, after a long meeting with Eisenhower, that one point on which Eisenhower and he had a particularly similar opinion was that the United States "cannot take action without allies."

But the warmonger Eisenhower will find that these "ways out" he is looking for all lead to a dead end. Clark will ask him to send three to four more divisions to Korea, but avoiding American casualties is precisely the important promise Eisenhower just made to win votes. Massively using the puppet Lee's army as cannon fodder? Facts have proven that this "new policy" will not work. The result of a large-scale test of this "way out" in October was that large numbers of puppet troops were killed, and U.S. losses also doubled compared to September. The Associated Press admitted, "This loss is second only to the defeat of the Eighth Army in North Korea in 1950." Using the Kuomintang bandit gang's troops as cannon fodder? The American columnist Pearson has already revealed the views of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, which is that these troops are in danger of surrendering to the Korean and Chinese People's Army in combat. The method of using troops from other countries to take the lead is also not easy to implement. Senior British figures in Tokyo have threatened that if Eisenhower decides to step up the Korean War, then this is "mainly an American affair," and he will find that "Britain is not very willing to follow."

All these problems that inevitably arise from continuing the war of aggression against Korea, Truman was unable to solve, and Eisenhower will not be able to solve them either; if they cannot be solved in Washington, they will not be solved in Korea either. If he continues and expands the war, then he will inevitably suffer an even more disastrous defeat than what Truman encountered. Eisenhower's son John, who is serving in the U.S. Third Infantry Division in Korea, has already concluded about his father's trip to Korea, saying: "Coming to Korea will not produce any miracles." Now, the people of the entire United States are strongly demanding that Eisenhower fulfill his promise to "end the Korean War," and no news blockade can prevent the people from quickly seeing through the shameless deception of this new Wall Street agent.

### 艾森豪威尔所谓“朝鲜之行”目的在策划战争

    艾森豪威尔所谓“朝鲜之行”目的在策划战争
    【新华社开城二十四日电】用“结束朝鲜战争”的诺言骗得多数选票的美国下一任总统艾森豪威尔，据美国通讯社透露，不久就要到朝鲜来“视察”。美国国防部二十日煞有介事地发表一个声明，说将对艾森豪威尔的朝鲜之行保持完全的秘密。这实际上是企图用新闻封锁的黑幕，遮盖艾森豪威尔前来朝鲜的真正目的。
    当美国总统竞选的丑剧发展到高潮时，艾森豪威尔“戏剧性地”声称他将亲自到朝鲜来找寻早日结束朝鲜战争的出路，以迎合美国人民渴求停战的心情。美国报纸甚至传播消息说，如果艾森豪威尔十一月四日当选，十一月六日他就启程赴朝。
    其实，结束朝鲜战争的出路早就有了。出路只有一条。全部停战协定已经达成协议，连文字细节都已准备就绪，只要美方放弃扣留战俘的主张，立刻可以签字停火，让战俘回家过圣诞节，终止美国士兵每周成千的伤亡。除此之外，美国在朝鲜只有引向更大失败的一条绝路。但是艾森豪威尔对于真正能立即导致停战的出路显然是没有兴趣的，他的发言人已一再声明他将坚持所谓“不强迫遣返战俘”的无理原则，继续封闭停战之门。美联社也在二十一日放出空气说：艾森豪威尔和他的未来的国务卿杜勒斯都“怀疑是否可能与朝鲜境内的共产党达成协议”，并说杜勒斯对朝鲜停战的可能性“采取了悲观的看法”。
    事情很明显，艾森豪威尔到朝鲜来装模作样地找寻“出路”，实际上是来策划如何继续和扩大侵朝战争，以便华尔街老板能获得更多的利润。早在十一月七日，美国“华尔街日报”就透露艾森豪威尔朝鲜之行的任务是“推荐一些军事措施，如加速训练朝鲜军队，加速运送配备，加紧空中战争，采用新的两栖登陆办法，加强坦克和炮兵作战等”。美联社华盛顿二十一日电报道说，华盛顿的“消息灵通人士”相信，艾森豪威尔到朝鲜去，“主要将研究朝鲜问题的军事方面”，此外，他“还会考察一下在明春下令发动一次攻势的可能性如何”。除了加强早已破产的“军事压力”以外，艾森豪威尔还准备乘机压迫其他国家出兵。十一月八日的美国“商业周刊”透露，艾森豪威尔将比杜鲁门更为强硬地要求所谓“盟国”在战争中“担负起更大的责任”。美国参议员史坦尼斯也在二十日说，艾森豪威尔朝鲜之行的“基本效果，就是促使各国更公平地分担朝鲜战争的负担”。美国共和党参议员史密斯二十一日在和艾森豪威尔进行长时间会谈以后宣称，艾森豪威尔和他的意见特别相同的一点是：美国“不能没有盟国而采取行动”。
    但是好战的艾森豪威尔将发现，他所寻找的这些“出路”都引向死路一条。克拉克将要求他增派三至四个师到朝鲜来，但是避免美军伤亡恰恰是艾森豪威尔为了骗取选票刚刚作过的重要诺言。大量使用李伪军替死吧，事实已经证明这个“新政策”不行。十月份大规模试探这条“出路”的结果，伪军大批送死，美军的损失也较九月份增加了一倍。美联社承认，“这次损失仅次于一九五零年第八军在北朝鲜惨败时的损失”。用国民党匪帮的军队来替死吧，美国的专栏作家皮尔逊已经透露了美国三军参谋长的看法，这就是这些军队在作战时有向朝中人民军队投降的危险。用其他国家的军队来挡头阵的办法也不是容易办到的。东京的高级英国人士已经扬言，如果艾森豪威尔决定加紧进行朝鲜战争，那末这“主要是美国的事情”，他将发现“英国不大愿意跟着走”。
    所有这些继续侵朝战争必然产生的问题，杜鲁门没有能够解决，艾森豪威尔也无法解决；在华盛顿解决不了，到朝鲜还是一样。如果他继续和扩大战争，那末他必然要遭到比杜鲁门所遭遇的更惨重的失败。在侵朝美军第三师中服役的艾森豪威尔的儿子约翰，已经给他父亲的朝鲜之行作出结论说：“到朝鲜来一趟并不会产生什么奇迹”。现在，全美国的人民正强烈地要求艾森豪威尔履行他的“结束朝鲜战争”的诺言，新闻封锁决不能避免人民迅速拆穿这个华尔街新代理人的无耻骗局。
