    Thank You to the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital for Selflessly Serving Patients
    To the Editor: We are patients in the dermatology ward of the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital. Although we have not been hospitalized for long, we have been deeply moved by the internationalist spirit of the Soviet experts and their selfless dedication to serving patients.
    "People are the most precious!" The Soviet experts fully demonstrated this idea in their work. Once, a critically ill patient was sent to the hospital. The director of surgery, Vaskrisinsky, immediately sent the patient to the treatment room for diagnosis and treatment without waiting for the patient to complete the formalities and pay the fees, because he was afraid of delaying the time and delaying the patient's treatment. This is in stark contrast to the situation in capitalist countries where "hospital doors open on both sides, and if you are sick but have no money, don't come in!"
    For the sake of the patients, the Soviet comrades worked selflessly. The surgical patient Li Shuanglu suffered from arteriovenous fistula. The director of surgery, Vaskrisinsky, the expert Dumansky, and the Chinese doctor Wang Qingchun performed surgery on him. They did not eat for eight and a half consecutive hours and did not return to the dormitory at night, waiting for the patient. Such things happen countless times.
    The Soviet experts paid great attention to providing patients with a beautiful environment for recuperation. Even a restaurant is beautifully decorated, so that patients who can move around feel happy when they go to eat, in order to help patients recover their health.
    The Soviet experts attached great importance to the opinions of the patients and seriously and conscientiously conducted criticism and self-criticism. Once, a hospitalized patient did not receive the necessary items four hours after arriving in the ward and made a suggestion to the hospital. The Soviet comrades attached great importance to this, and the director of internal medicine, Vinogradov, and the head nurse, Tatyana Vasilyevna, immediately grasped the inspection and resolution and personally apologized to the patient to comfort them.
    Many of the patients in the hospital are chronic patients. Under the treatment of advanced Soviet medical technology, some have recovered or their condition has greatly improved, and the rest will gradually recover their health. Under the care and close attention of the Soviet comrades, we will take good care of our health and strive to recover as soon as possible, participate in the great construction cause of the motherland, and never let down the expectations of the Soviet comrades who are full of internationalist spirit towards us.

    感谢北京苏联红十字医院忘我地为病人服务
    编辑同志：我们是北京苏联红十字医院皮科病房的病人。我们住院时间虽然不长，但苏联专家的国际主义精神和忘我地为病人服务的工作作风已使我们深受感动。
    “人是最宝贵的！”苏联专家们在工作中充分表现了这个思想。有一次，一个急病病人被送到医院来。外科主任瓦斯克里辛斯基没等病人办手续和缴费，马上把病人送到诊疗室诊治。因为他怕耽搁了时间，延误了病人的治疗。这和资本主义国家的“医院大门两边开，有病无钱莫进来”的情况正是一个鲜明的对比！
    为了病人，苏联同志忘我地工作着。外科病人李双禄患动静脉瘘，外科主任瓦斯克里辛斯基、专家杜曼斯基和中国大夫王庆春给他动手术，连续八个半小时没吃饭，晚间不回宿舍，守候着病人。像这样的事情，是无数次中的一次。
    苏联专家们十分注意使病人有一个优美的养病环境。即使一个餐厅也布置得很美丽，使能行动的病人去吃饭时感到愉快，以便有助于病人恢复健康。
    苏联专家们很重视病人的意见，并认真严肃地进行批评和自我批评。有一次，一个住院的病人到病房后四小时，还没拿到应用物品，就向院方提出意见。苏联同志十分重视，内科主任维诺格拉道夫、护士长塔齐扬娜瓦西列夫娜立即抓紧检查和解决，并且亲自向这位病人表示歉意，进行安慰。
    医院里的病人，有很多是慢性病人。在苏联先进医术的治疗下，有些已经痊愈或病情大大好转，其余的也将逐渐恢复健康。我们在苏联同志的尽心治理和亲切关注下，一定好好养病，争取早日痊愈，参加祖国的伟大建设事业，决不辜负苏联同志对我们充满国际主义精神的期望。
