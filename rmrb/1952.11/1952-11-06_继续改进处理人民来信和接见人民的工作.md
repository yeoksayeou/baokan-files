    Continue to Improve the Work of Handling People's Letters and Receiving People

    Since the exposure of the Zhang Shunyou incident, all regions have been actively strengthening and improving the work of handling people's letters and receiving people. This has made the relationship between the Party and the People's Government and the people closer. However, the experience of this work has not yet been systematically summarized. How to make this work better and more effective is still a problem that needs to be studied and solved. The practices of the Beijing Municipal People's Government published in this newspaper today should attract the attention of leading comrades in various regions and departments, especially those responsible for this work.

    What are the universally significant aspects of the Beijing Municipal People's Government's approach? First, the responsible comrades attach particular importance to this work. Mayor Peng Zhen has continuously instructed all units to earnestly do this work well. The administrative meeting formally made a decision to strengthen this work. The Mayor and Deputy Mayors personally read the Secretariat's weekly reports on people's letters and some original letters, give instructions on how to handle them, and propose further handling methods for inappropriate handling. The importance attached by the leaders has prompted other comrades to attach importance to it as well. Second, all units have generally established specialized personnel or institutions to carry out this work, paid attention to the allocation of cadres, and generally established various necessary systems such as registration, transfer, inspection, urging, and filing. The Secretariat of the Municipal People's Government also directly handles important people's letters through visits, interviews, investigations, etc., and conducts weekly classification statistics and research, and issues weekly reports. Third, the Municipal People's Government has paid attention to supervising and inspecting the work of handling people's letters and receiving people by its subordinate units. Not only does it generally carry out transfer and urging procedures, but it also pays attention to the inspection of the handling results, reporting, the review of the parties concerned, and informing the letter writers of the handling results. For units that do not do well enough, they are urged to review and make effective improvements. These practices are worthy of reference and imitation by all regions.

    Some shortcomings and problems in carrying out this work in some units, discovered by Beijing Municipality through inspection, are also worthy of attention by all regions. The first thing to pay attention to is that some units still do not consciously and earnestly carry out this work, but passively cope with it. Therefore, the phenomena of backlog delays and shirking responsibilities have not been eliminated. This requires continued strengthening of ideological education against bureaucracy and connecting with the masses of the people, as well as continuous inspection in work. Necessary measures should be taken against personnel who are seriously irresponsible. Necessary sanctions should be taken against those who resist people's criticism and retaliate. Secondly, it is necessary to analyze and comprehensively study people's letters, discover problems of general significance from individual letters, and solve them actively and systematically (such as labor and employment problems). Do not simply and always deal with them individually, passively handle one case at a time, and handle them for the sake of handling. To achieve this, it is particularly necessary for the responsible comrades of each unit to provide specific leadership for this work, discover problems from it, summarize experience, and improve the political level and work ability of the personnel directly responsible for this work. In addition, some units lack necessary procedures in handling people's letters, making it difficult to check afterwards; or the procedures are too cumbersome, affecting work efficiency and the mood of the people. These problems must be continuously improved in future practice. Mayor Peng Zhen instructed the responsible comrades of each unit to check this work every half month, which is of great significance for continuously improving this work. All regions can refer to and imitate it according to the specific circumstances.

### 继续改进处理人民来信和接见人民的工作

    继续改进处理人民来信和接见人民的工作
    在张顺有事件被揭发以后，各地都在积极加强与改善处理人民来信和接见人民的工作。这就使党和人民政府与人民群众之间的关系更加密切起来。但是，这项工作的经验还没有被系统地总结起来。究竟怎样能使这一工作做得更好，更有成效，还是一个需要研究与解决的问题。今天本报发表的北京市人民政府的做法，应该引起各地区各方面领导同志尤其是负责这一工作的同志们注意。
    北京市人民政府的做法，有那些是具有普遍意义的呢？第一、是负责同志特别重视这一工作。彭真市长曾经不断地指示各单位认真做好这项工作。行政会议曾经正式做出决定加强这项工作。市长、副市长，亲自阅读秘书厅关于人民来信的周报和部分原信，批示处理意见，并对处理不恰当的提出进一步处理的办法。首长的重视，促使其他同志也都重视。第二、各单位普遍设立了专门进行这项工作的人员或机构，注意了干部的配备，并一般地建立了登记、转办、检查、催办、存档等各项必要的制度。市人民政府秘书厅也以访问、约谈、调查等方式直接处理重要的人民来信，每周进行分类的统计与研究。做出周报。第三、市人民政府对于所属各单位处理人民来信和接见人民的工作，注意了督促和检查。不但一般地执行转办、催办手续，且注意了处理结果的检查，汇报，当事人的检讨，将处理结果告知来信人等。对做得不够好的单位，则督促其检讨，作有效的改进。这些做法，都值得各地参考仿行。
    北京市从检查中发现的某些单位进行这一工作中的缺点和问题，也值得各地注意。首先应注意的，是有的单位对于这一工作仍然不是自觉地认真地进行，而是消极应付。所以，积压拖延与推诿不管的现象仍未肃清。这就要求继续加强反官僚主义和联系人民群众的思想教育和工作上的不断检查。对于严重不负责的人员要做必要处理。对于抵抗人民批评和实行报复的人要做必要的制裁。其次，是对人民来信须做分析和综合研究的工作，从个别人的来信中发现具有一般意义的问题，作主动的系统的解决（如劳动就业等问题），不要单纯地永远地做个别的处理，被动地来一件办一件，为处理而处理。要做到这一点，就特别要求各单位负责同志对这项工作作具体的领导，从中发现问题，总结经验，提高直接负责此项工作的人员的政治水平与工作能力。另外，还有一些单位在处理人民来信中缺乏必要的手续，使事后难于检查；或手续太繁，影响工作效率与人民情绪。这些问题，都须在今后实践中不断改进。彭真市长指示各单位负责同志每半个月要把这一工作检查一次，这对于不断改进这一工作是有重要意义的。各地可以根据具体情况，参考仿行。
