    "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" Activities Widely Unfolded
    Over 20 Million People in Various Regions Have Seen Soviet Films and Exhibitions
    [Our Newspaper] "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities have been widely launched across the country. The broad masses of people have been further educated on Sino-Soviet friendship and the future of socialism and communism.
    During the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," various regions universally organized propaganda teams to carry out Sino-Soviet friendship propaganda through report meetings, discussion meetings, and other means. From the 7th to the 20th, 165 reporters from the East China District-level organs went deep into factories and schools to give reports; in Shanghai, 450 reporters at the municipal and district levels gave reports to factories, government agencies, schools, and residents, reaching an audience of 800,000 people. The district committees of various districts in Shanghai also invited people who had visited the Soviet Union to introduce the brilliant achievements of Soviet construction to people from all walks of life. By the 20th, the audience had reached 130,000 people. Each district in Guangzhou mobilized a large propaganda team to carry out Sino-Soviet friendship propaganda to street residents. The North District alone mobilized a propaganda team of 10,000 people. The "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" office in the Pearl River District also specially equipped a "Sino-Soviet Friendship" propaganda boat to conduct a roving propaganda along the river. In Xi'an, since the 17th, more than 30 propaganda teams with propagandists and members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association as the backbone, and propaganda groups composed of more than 20,000 college and middle school students, have been dispatched to carry out propaganda. In Chahar Province, the three cities of Zhangjiakou, Xuanhua, and Datong, and the two special districts of Chahar South and Yanbei alone, had a cumulative total of 4,120,000 people who received education on Sino-Soviet friendship and the future of social development.
    Report meetings, discussion meetings, and various propaganda activities held in various regions have played a great role in promoting Sino-Soviet friendship and helping the broad masses of people understand and learn from the Soviet Union. The discussion meetings held in many factories have universally exchanged experiences in learning from advanced Soviet experience. The typical group of the Qingdao Post and Telecommunications Bureau introduced their experience in learning the Kovalev work method at the bureau's report meeting, setting off a wave of learning throughout the bureau. After listening to the reports of Wang Kaide and other Soviet farmers' representatives, farmers in Chahar Province dispelled their ideological concerns about "eating from the same pot" and "returning to the big pile," and resolved to learn from Soviet farmers and take the road of collectivization. In Ying County, 243 farmers requested to join mutual aid groups, and 645 mutual aid groups formulated plans to further consolidate the mutual aid groups and transform them into agricultural production cooperatives. Thousands of relatives of overseas Chinese in Guangzhou held a grand get-together in Huanghuagang, inviting returned overseas Chinese who had participated in the Jingjiang flood diversion project to report on the story of Soviet experts helping our country's construction. After listening to the report, the relatives of overseas Chinese said with emotion: In the past, they were deceived by propaganda overseas and could not distinguish between friends and enemies. Only now do they understand that our motherland's construction work has progressed so rapidly in just three years, thanks to the help of Soviet elder brothers like Comrade Bukov!
    During the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," workers and natural science workers in various regions launched a widespread upsurge in learning from advanced Soviet experience. In order to better learn from advanced Soviet experience, workers in Xi'an held demonstrations of advanced Soviet work methods at four locations on November 18. During the demonstration, the audience was shown the benefits of learning from advanced Soviet experience by comparing the old and the new. Through this demonstration, the workers further recognized the superiority of advanced Soviet work methods and expressed their desire to better learn from advanced Soviet experience and create more wealth for the country. The advanced work method technology performance meeting held by the Guangzhou Workers' Cultural Palace, the center of workers' cultural entertainment, has started on the 15th; advanced technology seminars will also be held one after another. Factories such as the Guangzhou Electric Power Bureau's First Power Plant have held photo exhibitions introducing advanced Soviet production experience, which are very popular among workers. All the medical workers of the Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital are also widely learning advanced Soviet medical experience such as sleep therapy, painless childbirth, and Novocaine block anesthesia. At the Soviet advanced medical seminar, many doctors from the hospital pointed out the importance of learning advanced Soviet medicine from their own personal experience and criticized bourgeois medicine. The Hangzhou branch of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies and other groups held four lectures introducing Soviet tissue therapy, painless childbirth, sleep therapy, and Michurin's theory. Each lecture was attended by more than 1,000 people.
    During the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities, people in various regions have received profound education and have requested to join the organization of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. In the first half of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," 3,000 workers from the Datong Coal Mine in Chahar Province joined the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. Shuoxian combined propaganda activities to rectify the grassroots organizations of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in 272 villages and developed more than 40,000 new members. In recent days, more than 1,900 workers from the Jinzhou Textile Factory in Liaoxi Province have applied to join the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. All 401 workers in the Liqun Cigarette Factory in Hangzhou recently joined the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.
    Currently, there are still some shortcomings in the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities in various regions. In some areas, the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities have not yet been popularized in the vast rural areas; in some areas, the activities have not been carried out deeply enough, the propaganda activities are generalized, and not enough attention has been paid to systematically solving the specific ideological problems of the masses; some areas have not paid attention to timely transforming the enthusiasm of the masses for Sino-Soviet friendship into practical work. Various regions should immediately check and correct the above shortcomings, seize the time, and through the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities, widely and centrally conduct an education on Sino-Soviet friendship and the future of socialism and communism to the masses, improve the masses' understanding of the Soviet Union, and strengthen the friendly unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union, in order to welcome the large-scale economic and cultural construction that will soon begin in our country.
    (Xinhua News Agency) The broad masses of people across the country love Soviet films. According to incomplete statistics, in the half month from the 7th to the 21st, in the cities where Soviet film exhibitions were held, the audience reached more than 20 million people, and more than 4 million people have pre-purchased tickets to see Soviet films. In many cities, the number of viewers has greatly exceeded the total population of the city. For example, in Nanchang, by the 16th, each person had watched an average of two Soviet films.
    In factories, mines, rural areas, and remote areas, film projection teams have been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and minority nationalities. In order to watch Soviet films, workers in Shapingba, Chongqing, specially built a temporary cinema that could accommodate more than 1,000 people. In mountainous areas or remote areas with difficult transportation, many farmers have never seen a movie. When they saw the projection team coming from afar to show Soviet films, they were very moved. The minority nationalities in remote areas love Soviet films even more. After hearing the news that the projection team was coming, farmers of minority nationalities in Danzhai County, Guizhou Province, traveled over mountains and ridges from 90 miles away to watch Soviet films.

    “中苏友好月”活动广泛展开
    各地已有二千多万人看了苏联影片展览
    【本报讯】“中苏友好月”活动已在全国各地广泛展开。广大人民群众进一步受到了中苏友好的教育和社会主义与共产主义前途的教育。
    各地在“中苏友好月”中，普遍组织了宣传队伍，以报告会、座谈会等方式，展开了中苏友好宣传。华东区一级机关的报告员，自七日至二十日，已有一百六十五人深入工厂、学校作了报告；上海市、区两级报告员，已有四百五十人到工厂、机关、学校和居民中作了报告，听众达八十万人。上海市各区区委还邀请曾到苏联参观过的人向各界人民介绍苏联建设的光辉成就，到二十日止，听众已有十三万人。广州市各区都出动了庞大的宣传队伍，向街道居民进行中苏友好的宣传。仅北区一个区就出动了一万人的宣传队伍。珠江区“中苏友好月”办公室还特别装置了一艘“中苏友好”宣传船，沿江作巡回宣传。西安市从十七日起，已有以宣传员和中苏友好协会会员为骨干的三十多个宣传队和两万多大、中学生组成的宣传小组，出动宣传。察哈尔省，仅张家口、宣化、大同三市和察南、雁北二专区，累计即有四百一十二万人，受到了有关中苏友好及社会发展前途的教育。
    各地举行的报告会、座谈会和各种宣传活动，对于促进中苏友谊和帮助广大人民群众认识苏联、学习苏联起了很大作用。很多工厂中举行的座谈会，都普遍地交流了学习苏联先进经验的体会。青岛邮电局典型组，在该局报告会上介绍了他们学习苏联郭瓦廖夫工作法的心得，掀起了全局的学习热潮。察哈尔省农民听了访苏农民代表王开德等的报告，解除了“吃大锅饭”、“归大堆”的思想顾虑，决心学习苏联农民，走集体化的道路。应县就有二百四十三户农民要求加入互助组，六百四十五个互助组订出计划，准备进一步巩固互助组，转为农业生产合作社。广州市数千个华侨眷属在黄花岗举行了一个盛大的联欢会，邀请参加过荆江分洪工程的归侨报告苏联专家帮助我国建设的故事。侨眷们听了报告以后感动地说：过去在海外受了欺骗宣传，分不清敌友。现在才明白，我们祖国在短短三年里建设工作进行得这样快，多亏像布可夫同志那样的苏联老大哥们的帮助啊！
    各地职工及自然科学工作者等在“中苏友好月”中，掀起了广泛学习苏联先进经验的热潮。西安市工人为更好地学习苏联先进经验，十一月十八日分别在四处举行了苏联先进工作法示范表演。在表演时用新旧对比的方法向观众说明学习苏联先进经验的好处。通过这次表演，工人们进一步认识了苏联先进工作法的优越性，表示要更好地学习苏联先进经验，为国家创造更多的财富。广州市工人文化娱乐的中心——工人文化宫举办的先进工作法技术表演会已从十五日开始；先进技术座谈会也即将陆续举行。广州电业局第一发电厂等工厂都举办了以介绍苏联先进生产经验为内容的图片展览会，极受工人们的欢迎。广东省人民医院的全体医务工作者也正在广泛学习睡眠疗法、无痛分娩法及奴佛卡因封闭麻醉疗法等苏联先进医学经验。在苏联先进医学座谈会上，该院许多医师都从自己的切身体验指出学习苏联先进医学的重要，对资产阶级医学进行了批判。中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会杭州分会等团体举办了四个演讲会，介绍苏联的组织疗法、无痛分娩法、睡眠疗法和米丘林学说。每次听讲的都在千人以上。
    各地人民在“中苏友好月”活动中，受到了深刻的教育，纷纷要求参加中苏友好协会的组织。察哈尔省大同煤矿在“中苏友好月”上半月中，就有三千工人加入了中苏友好协会。朔县结合宣传活动，整顿了二百七十二个村的中苏友协基层组织，发展了四万多名新会员。辽西省锦州纺织厂职工连日来申请参加中苏友好协会的已达一千九百多人。杭州市利群烟厂全厂四百零一个职工最近全部参加了中苏友好协会。
    目前，各地“中苏友好月”活动，也还存在一些缺点。个别地区，“中苏友好月”活动还没有普及到广大农村；有的地区活动开展得不够深入，宣传活动一般化，对系统地解决群众具体的思想问题注意不够；有的地区没有注意把群众对中苏友好的热情及时转到实际工作中去。各地应即检查纠正上述缺点，抓紧时间，通过“中苏友好月”活动，广泛地集中地对群众进行一次中苏友好和社会主义与共产主义前途的教育，提高群众对苏联的认识，加强中苏两国人民的友好团结，以迎接我国即将开始的大规模的经济和文化建设。
    据新华社讯：全国广大人民热爱苏联影片。根据不完全统计，从七日到二十一日的半个月中，在举行苏联影片展览的城市，观众已达二千多万人，还有四百万以上的人已预购了看苏联影片的座券。许多城市的观众人数已大大超过了全市人口的总数，如南昌市到十六日止，平均每人已看过两场苏联影片。
    在工厂、矿山、农村和边远地区，电影放映队受到了广大工农群众和少数民族人民的热烈欢迎。重庆沙坪坝的工人为了看苏联影片，特地赶建了一座可以容纳一千多人的临时影院。在交通困难的山区或偏僻的地区，有很多农民从来没看过电影，当他们看见放映队远道赶来放映苏联影片时，都非常感动。在边远地区的少数民族人民更加热爱苏联影片。贵州省丹寨县的少数民族农民听到放映队到来的消息后，从九十里地以外爬山越岭赶去看苏联影片。
