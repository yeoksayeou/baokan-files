Learning from the Advanced Medicine of the Soviet Union

Fu Lianzhang, Vice Minister of Health of the Central People's Government

The great 35th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution has arrived. The working class, working people, and all oppressed and enslaved people around the world are greeting this festival with unparalleled joy. They are unanimously cheering for the prosperity and strength of the Soviet Union, the staunch fortress of peace and democracy, and the beacon of human liberation. Because the prosperity and strength of the Soviet Union infinitely inspires their courage and confidence in the struggle for lasting peace, people's democracy, and socialism. The Soviet Union is the most loyal friend of the Chinese people. It has provided various generous and selfless powerful assistance to the cause of the Chinese people's liberation. This is an important condition for the victory of the Chinese revolution and the smooth progress of future construction work. The Soviet Union's assistance to us in medicine and health is also significant. Let me briefly cite a few examples to illustrate: As everyone knows, Northeast China was a plague-prone area before liberation, and the annual plague epidemics caused great losses to people's lives and property. From 1947 to 1949, at the invitation of our country, the Soviet Red Cross and Red Crescent Society sent epidemic prevention teams to Northeast China every year to help carry out prevention and control work. The Soviet epidemic prevention team consisted of experts, epidemic prevention personnel, disinfection personnel, nurses, etc., and along with the epidemic prevention team came a large number of medicines, equipment, protective clothing, laboratory instruments, hospital equipment, and patients' clothing and bedding, etc., everything related to epidemic prevention was available. The personnel of the Soviet epidemic prevention team were able to carry out their work with specialized scientific knowledge and high work enthusiasm, thus reducing the incidence and mortality rate of plague in Northeast China year by year, and it has now been completely controlled. The plague that occurred in Chabei in 1949 was also quickly eradicated with the direct help of the Soviet epidemic prevention team. The Soviet epidemic prevention team not only helped us to eradicate the plague that had already occurred, but more importantly, taught us scientific epidemic prevention methods and helped us train a large number of epidemic prevention personnel, laying a solid foundation for future epidemic prevention work. The plague, which used to cause "tiger phobia," has now been controlled throughout the country, and has even been completely eliminated in some areas. This is inseparable from the help of Soviet friends.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, at the invitation of our country, sent many medical experts to China to help with health construction and medical care work. The old Chinese medical education system was very unreasonable. The duration ranged from four to eight years, and the curriculum content was inconsistent. Therefore, the doctors trained were not only far behind the objective needs in terms of quantity, but also could not meet the needs of the people in terms of quality. In order to solve this problem, the People's Government was determined to carry out educational system reform, requiring the creation of a large number of high-quality medical workers to meet the needs of health construction and people's health. Soviet medical expert Comrade Bekov gave us significant help in this regard. He actively introduced the new Soviet medical system, educational organization, and teaching methods, and more specifically assisted us in formulating teaching syllabuses for higher and secondary medical colleges, and suggested that we run training courses for senior health administration cadres, personally serving as the main speaker. Regardless of his own health (he had a history of heart disease), he wrote reports day and night, prepared teaching materials, and introduced the outstanding achievements and experiences of the Soviet socialist health cause, which gave great help to China's health cause. The establishment of the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital is another concrete manifestation of the Soviet Union's assistance and friendly cooperation in health and medicine. The establishment of this hospital not only helped us solve many difficult medical problems, but also provided us with a good example in terms of hospital management, medical system, and medical style.

Under the glorious light of Marxism-Leninism, and under the personal leadership of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet Union has made unprecedented progress in economic construction, cultural construction, and national defense construction, and has achieved brilliant achievements. It has created the world's highest level in many aspects and accumulated rich experience, which is a common treasure of mankind. Learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union will enable us to avoid many detours and greatly accelerate the speed of our country's construction.

Soviet medicine is the most advanced medicine in the world. It is developed by using the scientific method of dialectical materialism and combining it with the needs of the people. Because it has mastered the scientific method of dialectical materialism, it is possible to most truthfully and correctly understand the physiological phenomena of the human body, to explore the root causes of diseases, and thus to obtain effective methods for preventing and controlling diseases. Pavlov's theory is an outstanding representative of advanced Soviet medicine. Pavlov regarded the human body as an organic whole, and he believed that the occurrence of disease is related to both internal and external conditions. His theory of higher nervous activity has opened up a new path in the field of medicine. Because Soviet medicine is closely integrated with the needs of the people, it can benefit the people by starting from the most urgent needs of the people. For example, the painless childbirth method established by Soviet physicians Vilyovsky, Borochizel, and Shugom based on Pavlov's theory has created a new childbirth method that eliminates the pain of childbirth for half of humanity's women. Filatov's tissue therapy provides effective treatments for dozens of chronic diseases that doctors previously considered difficult or even impossible to treat, allowing many blind people to regain their sight. The Soviet Union also has rich experience in physical therapy (such as electrotherapy, hydrotherapy, mud therapy, wax application, cupping, massage, etc.). This treatment method is simple and inexpensive, but it does have high therapeutic effects for certain diseases. Other treatments such as sleep therapy and sports therapy have also been proven by facts to have significant effects on certain diseases. These advanced medical ideas and advanced experiences are worthy of our good study.

We must also learn from the advanced medical system and medical style of the Soviet Union. When a person gets sick, they are already very uncomfortable mentally. If you add the hospital's dull and boring environment, it is easier to increase the patient's mental burden. The Soviet Union is now trying its best to make the hospital feel like a home. All furnishings and atmosphere are required to make the patient feel like they are living at home. Coupled with the enthusiasm and kindness, conscientiousness and responsibility of the medical staff, the patient can have a high degree of trust in the hospital. Doctors also pay great attention to the patient's psychological state when diagnosing the disease, and help the patient solve ideological problems. All of these greatly help improve the treatment effect. The department director responsibility system in the hospital ensures that all medical and nursing work is carried out under the unified leadership of the department director, which is convenient for inspection and supervision, and mutual cooperation. The 15-minute morning meeting held daily at the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital is a very good system. At the morning meeting, the hospital负责人 listens to reports, commends the good, and criticizes the bad. In addition, they have also established visiting groups to regularly solicit patients' opinions and solve them in a timely manner, which is of great benefit to promoting hospital work. All of these are worth emulating.

We must also learn from the spirit of Soviet medical workers who wholeheartedly serve the sick and wounded. The examples I cite below are all examples of how Soviet medical staff treated Chinese patients. When caring for a seriously ill patient, Soviet epidemic prevention team nurse Maria stayed by the patient's side for several days without sleep, observing the patient's pulse. The patient's heart was very weak and often showed symptoms of collapse. Whenever this phenomenon occurred, she would quickly give injections of cardiac stimulants and physiological saline, use warm compresses... The patient was finally rescued. After she finished her work, she sighed repeatedly and said: "How can this continue! If possible, I would like to exchange hearts with him." Her sincere affection is touching! The Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital received Xin Keyi, a patient with suppurative cholecystitis. Xin Keyi was in critical condition. Comrade Vaskresensky, the director of surgery, immediately performed the operation without eating, and stayed in the ward at night to deal with the condition at any time. An old man named Ren Yongbin, who suffered from empyema, suddenly vomited blood after being sent to the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital. His blood pressure dropped and his pulse was weak. In order to rescue this elderly patient, Vaskresensky did not eat dinner and worked all night until the patient was out of danger the next day. He did not rest, but continued to go to work. When laboratory technician Li Mina performed tests on patients, she often drew her own blood. Dr. Mayat came back from a consultation and immediately went to the ward to examine the patients. She would visit seriously ill patients several times a day and often got up at night to see patients. In order to save patients, they often forgot to eat and sleep, and even worked while sick. Their diagnosis and treatment of patients were very careful and serious. There is an old Soviet saying "Measure seven times and cut once." Soviet doctors work in this spirit. They are extremely concerned about the pain of patients, and always adhere to the principle of trying not to damage or destroy a single cell or tissue of the patient. Whenever possible, they try to adopt conservative treatment methods instead of surgery to preserve the integrity of the patient's body and maintain their ability to work. They will try to save a patient as long as they think they can live one more minute. For example, a seriously ill child was sent to the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital. The Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital gathered more than a dozen doctors to consult and tried every means to save him, allowing the dying child to live for another 45 minutes. In this way, although the child died, the child's mother had no complaints and repeatedly expressed her gratitude. There are many other model deeds of Soviet medical experts that cannot be listed one by one. In short, the working spirit of Soviet medical workers is worthy of our study.

Finally, and most importantly, we must learn from the patriotism and internationalism of Soviet medical workers. The reason why Soviet medicine has achieved such outstanding achievements is not only due to the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and the attention and support of the Soviet government, but also because every medical worker has a patriotic spirit of dedicating himself to science and dedicating himself to the people, thus overcoming difficulties, constantly studying, and striving for excellence. Their internationalist spirit is clearly manifested in the Soviet medical experts who came to work in our country. One Soviet expert said to a Chinese patient: "I treat you like a Soviet citizen, and at the same time I care about you like a Chinese expert." This sentence fully embodies the internationalist spirit of Soviet medical workers. Soviet medical workers teach us the advanced experience of the Soviet Union without reservation. In order to teach us rescue knowledge, one Soviet expert walked back and forth in the cold wind and on the frozen wilderness, repeatedly demonstrating, and the recipients were all moved. They can also proceed from the principle of simplification and economy according to China's economic conditions. In short, they treat the cause of the Chinese people as their own cause. Only the new type of people cultivated by Marxism-Leninism can do this.

We have already made many achievements in learning from the advanced medicine of the Soviet Union. For example, our three major principles of health work are formulated based on the spirit of Marxism-Leninism and drawing on the experience of Soviet health construction. In addition, we have drawn on the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in health organizations, medical education, epidemic prevention and health care, etc. In terms of medical technology, I would like to cite two examples: painless childbirth and tissue therapy. Since the Ministry of Health issued a notice on promoting painless childbirth on June 17 of this year, as of the end of September, according to incomplete statistics from all over the country, 5,934 people have been treated, of which 5,507 have been successful, accounting for 92.8%. In addition to promoting painless childbirth in hospitals, Beijing is also promoting it in families, achieving a success rate of 93.6%. In remote Xinjiang, painless childbirth is also being promoted. The promotion of tissue therapy started earlier. After the Ministry of Health issued instructions last March, it convened a national symposium in September to summarize the experience of promotion. Based on the opinions of the symposium, 27 indications for tissue therapy were prescribed, most of which are chronic and stubborn diseases. These diseases used to make many health agencies and medical personnel feel difficult to deal with. Since the adoption of tissue therapy, some problems have indeed been solved. For example, the effective rate of bronchial asthma reached 77.14%, peptic ulcer reached 76.28%, and scar contracture reached 75.28%. According to the statistics at the aforementioned symposium, more than 28,000 people have been treated with tissue therapy nationwide, and the case effect is between 60% and 70%. After more than a year of research and development, there will definitely be greater achievements, which can be asserted. However, it should be pointed out that we have not done enough in learning from the advanced medicine of the Soviet Union. In particular, we have not done enough in systematically introducing new Soviet medical theories. For example, among our research staff and teaching staff, Pavlov's theory has not been studied and taught in a planned way. Although we have translated some of Pavlov's papers, they are still fragmented. There is no more comprehensive and systematic research and introduction, which should be strengthened in the future.

How can we better learn from the advanced medicine of the Soviet Union? I think the first thing to solve is an ideological problem, that is, to confirm the advancement of Soviet medicine, just like its advancement in politics and economics. As long as you open your eyes and look more at reality, this is not difficult to prove. Most of our old Chinese medicine is copied from the British, American, German and Japanese sets, which are based on idealism and mechanical materialism. Therefore, many are not completely scientific, and many are out of touch with the needs of the people. For these things, we should criticize them with a spirit of seeking truth from facts, oppose blind worship of Britain and the United States, oppose narrow-minded conservatism, and clearly recognize that only by learning from Soviet medicine can our medicine have a bright future.

Soviet medicine, like other Soviet sciences, is cultivated and developed under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, if we want to learn from the advanced medicine of the Soviet Union, we must also study Marxism-Leninism at the same time, master the scientific method of dialectical materialism, strengthen the idea of serving the people, and thoroughly carry out ideological transformation.

Medicine is a practical science, and we particularly emphasize the connection between theory and practice. Do not stop learning Soviet medicine in books and words, but use it in practical actions. Learn a little, use it in practice, and continue to explore it in practical application. But at the same time, we must closely combine it with China's actual situation to learn, in order to distinguish which we can learn now and which can only be achieved after creating certain conditions. We cannot mechanically move things. In addition, the excellent heritage and new creations of our Chinese medicine must also be preserved and developed.

Finally, I would like to especially point out that learning from the advanced medicine of the Soviet Union must vigorously eliminate medical accidents. Because medicine serves the health of the people, and medical accidents harm the health of the people and even endanger lives. Unfortunately, medical accidents still exist quite seriously in medical institutions across the country. There may be three main reasons for medical accidents: one is ideological problems, one is system problems, and one is technical problems, and the ideological problem is the most important. If our medical workers have unlimited enthusiasm for patients, and thus engage in work with a humble, careful, and patient attitude, do not be self-righteous if you do not understand in technology, but sincerely ask others for advice, and tirelessly study business, and continuously improve in technology, plus strict systems, careful inspections, etc., medical accidents can be reduced and eliminated. The Patriotic Health Campaign is a good example of our country combining medical science with the broad masses of the people. This movement not only shattered the bacteriological warfare of US imperialism, but also greatly improved the level of our health work. It has greatly changed the health conditions of our cities and villages, improved people's health knowledge, reduced the incidence and mortality of diseases, and created favorable conditions for further carrying out health work in the future. We must carry out this movement more universally and deeply, make it regular, and turn it into a part of people's living habits to ensure the health of the people. On the one hand, we learn from the advanced medicine of the Soviet Union, and at the same time, we continue to carry forward the fine traditions of our country's health and medical work, and combine the two. The development of our country's health work has unlimited bright prospects. (Attached picture)

    学习苏联的先进医学
    中央人民政府卫生部副部长  傅连暲
    伟大的十月社会主义革命三十五周年到来了，全世界的工人阶级、劳动人民以及一切被压迫被奴役的人民都以无比欢欣的心情来迎接这个节日，一致为和平民主的坚强堡垒、人类解放的灯塔——苏联的繁荣强盛而欢呼，因为苏联的繁荣和强盛，无限地鼓舞了他们为争取持久和平、人民民主和社会主义而斗争的勇气和信心。苏联是中国人民最忠实的朋友，它对中国人民的解放事业曾经给予了各种慷慨无私的有力的援助，这是中国革命能以取得胜利及今后建设工作能以顺利进行的一个重要条件。苏联在医药卫生方面给我们的援助也是很大的。我简单地举几个例子来说明：大家都知道，我国东北在解放前是一个鼠疫流行区，每年的鼠疫流行，都给人民生命财产造成很大的损失。自一九四七年至一九四九年，苏联红十字红新月协会应我国邀请，每年都派遣防疫队来东北帮助进行防治工作。苏联防疫队的组成包括专家、防疫员、消毒员、护士等等，而且随着防疫队带来了大批药品器材、防疫服装、化验仪器、病院设备和病人的衣服被褥等等，凡是和防疫有关的东西，应有尽有。苏联防疫队的人员都能以专门的科学知识及高度的工作热情进行工作，因而使东北鼠疫的发病率、死亡率逐年降低，现在已被完全控制。    一九四九年察北发生的鼠疫，也是在苏联防疫队的直接帮助下，才得以迅速扑灭的。苏联防疫队不但帮助我们扑灭了已经发生的鼠疫，更重要的是教给我们以科学的防疫方法，帮助我们培养了大批防疫人员，为今后防疫工作打下了巩固的基础。过去令人有“谈虎色变”之感的鼠疫，现在在全国范围内已被控制，有些地区并已完全消灭，这是和苏联友人的帮助分不开的。
    中华人民共和国成立后，苏联更应我国邀请派遣了许多医学专家来我国帮助卫生建设和医疗保健工作。旧中国的医学教育制度很不合理，在年限上由四年到八年，在课程内容上也不一致，因此培养出来的医生不仅在数量上远远落后于客观的需要，在质量上也不能满足人民的要求。为了解决这个问题，人民政府下决心进行学制改革，要求造就量多而质高的医务工作人员，以适应卫生建设和人民健康的需要。苏联医学专家贝阔夫同志在这方面给了我们以重大的帮助。他积极地介绍苏联新的医学制度、教育组织、教学方法，更具体地协助我们制订高、中级医学院校的教学大纲，并建议我们开办高级卫生行政干部训练班，亲任主讲人，他不顾自己身体的健康（过去曾患心脏病），昼夜写报告，准备教材，介绍苏联社会主义卫生事业的卓越成就和经验，给了我国卫生事业以很大帮助。北京苏联红十字医院的成立，是苏联在卫生医药方面给予我们援助和友好合作的又一具体表现。这个医院的成立，不仅帮助我们解决了许多疑难的疾病医疗问题，同时在医院管理、医疗制度、医疗作风方面也给我们提供了很好的榜样。
    苏联在马克思列宁主义的光辉照耀下，在列宁斯大林的亲自领导下，无论经济建设、文化建设、国防建设各方面都以史无前例的速度向前迈进，获得了辉煌的成绩，在许多方面创造了世界最高水平，并积累了丰富的经验，这是人类共同的宝藏。学习苏联先进经验将使我们少走许多弯路，大大加速我国建设的速度。
    苏联的医学是世界上最先进的医学。它是运用辩证唯物主义的科学方法并和人民需要相结合而发展起来的。因为掌握了辩证唯物主义的科学方法，就有可能最真实最正确地认识人体的生理现象，来探索疾病的根源，从而获致防治疾病的有效方法。巴甫洛夫学说就是苏联先进医学的杰出代表。巴甫洛夫把人体当作一个有机的整体，他认为疾病的发生和体内体外的条件皆有关系。他的高级神经活动学说在医学领域中开辟了新的道路。因为苏联医学是和人民需要紧密结合的，它就能从人民最迫切的需要出发，造福人民。比如苏联医师维利渥夫斯基、波罗琪柴尔和舒高姆等根据巴甫洛夫学说建立的无痛分娩法，为占人类半数的妇女们创造了免除生育痛苦的新生育法。费拉托夫的组织疗法对几十种过去医生认为棘手甚至没有办法治疗的慢性病，提供了有效的疗法，使许多失明的人可以重见天日。苏联在理学疗法（如电疗、水疗、泥疗、蜡敷、拔罐子、按摩等）方面也有丰富的经验。此种治疗方法简便，所费不大，但对某些疾病确有很高的治疗效果。他如睡眠疗法、体育疗法等等都经事实证明对某些疾病有显著的效果。这些先进的医学思想和先进经验，是值得我们很好学习的。
    我们还要学习苏联先进的医疗制度、医疗作风。一个人生了病，精神上已经很不舒服，如再加医院呆板枯燥的环境，更容易增加病人的精神负担。苏联现正尽力使医院家庭化，一切陈设、气氛都要求作到使病人好像住在家里一样；再加上医护人员的热情亲切，认真负责，就能够使病人对于医院产生高度的信赖。而医生在诊病时又十分重视病人的心理状态，帮助病人解决思想问题。所有这些就大大帮助了治疗效果的提高。医院中的科主任负责制，使一切医疗护理工作都在科主任统一领导下进行，便于检查督促，互相配合。北京苏联红十字医院现在实行的每日十五分钟早会，是一种很好的制度。在早会上，医院负责人听取汇报，表扬好的，批评坏的。另外，他们并建立了访问小组，经常征求病人意见，及时予以解决，这对推动医院工作有很大的好处。所有这些，都值得仿效。
    我们还要学习苏联医务工作者全心全意为伤病员服务的精神。我在下面举的例子，都是苏联医护人员对待中国病人的例子。苏联防疫队护士马利亚在照护一个病势严重的患者时，曾连续几天彻夜不眠地守在病人身旁，观察病人的脉搏。病人心脏甚弱，常呈虚脱现象。每当这种现象发生时，她就连忙打强心针、生理食盐水，用温罨包……这个病人终于被挽救了过来。当她工作完了以后，她曾连连叹息地说：“这样发作下去怎么得了！如果可能的话，我愿意和他交换心脏。”真情挚意，令人感动！北京苏联红十字医院接收了胆囊炎化脓患者辛克义。辛克义病势危急，外科主任瓦斯克莱辛斯基同志不吃饭马上作手术，晚上住在病房，随时处理病情。患脓胸的老头任用宾，送入北京苏联红十字医院后突然吐血，血压降低，脉搏微弱。为了抢救这位年老的患者，瓦斯克莱辛斯基晚饭未吃，整整工作了一夜，直至第二日患者转危为安。而他并未休息，仍继续上班。化验员李米娜在给病人化验时，经常抽自己的血。马亚特大夫出诊回来，马上到病房诊视病人，对重病人每天要去看好几趟，夜里也常常起来看病人。为了救治病人，他们经常废寝忘食，甚至带病工作。他们对病人的诊断治疗都是非常仔细认真的，苏联有句古语“量七次裁一次”，苏联医生就是本着这种精神来工作的。他们对病人的痛痒是极其关心的，总以尽量不损伤不破坏病人一个细胞一个组织为原则。凡能不动手术者，尽量采取保守疗法，以保全病人身体的完整和保持其劳动能力。一个病人只要他们认为能多活一分钟都要设法挽救。例如有一个患重病的小孩子送到了北京苏联红十字医院。北京苏联红十字医院集中了十几位医生来会诊，多方设法挽救他，使行将死亡的孩子多活了三刻钟。这样，孩子虽然死了，孩子的母亲却毫无怨言，而且再三表示感谢。还有许多苏联医学专家的模范事迹不能一一列举。总之，苏联医务工作者的工作精神是值得我们学习的。
    最后，也是最重要的，我们要学习苏联医务工作者的爱国主义和国际主义精神。苏联医学所以取得如此卓越的成就，一方面由于马克思列宁主义思想的指导，苏联政府的重视扶持，同时也由于每个医务工作者都有献身于科学，献身于人民的爱国主义的精神，因而克服困难，不断钻研，精益求精。他们的国际主义精神，在来到我国工作的苏联医学专家的身上表现得很明显。一个苏联专家对一个中国病员说过这样的话：“我对待你像对待苏联公民一样，同时我自己也像中国专家一样地关心你。”这句话充分地体现了苏联医务工作者的国际主义精神。苏联医务工作者把苏联的先进经验毫无保留地教给我们。一位苏联专家，为了教给我们救护知识，在凛冽的寒风中，在冰冻的旷野上往返奔走，反复示教，受教者无不感动。他们并能根据中国经济条件，处处从精简节约出发。总之他们是把中国人民的事业当作他们自己的事业来看待的。这只有马克思列宁主义思想培养出来的新型的人才能这样作的。
    我们在学习苏联先进医学方面，已经有了许多成绩。比如我们的卫生工作三大原则，就是根据马克思列宁主义的精神，吸取苏联卫生建设的经验而制订的。此外在卫生组织、医学教育、防疫保健等等方面，我们都吸取了苏联先进的经验。在医疗技术上，我想举无痛分娩法和组织疗法两个例子。自本年六月十七日中央卫生部发出关于推行无痛分娩法的通知后，截至九月底止，据全国各地不完全统计，已施行了五千九百三十四人，其中五千五百零七人获得成功，占百分之九十二点八。北京市除在医院推行无痛分娩法外，并在家庭中推行，获得了百分之九十三点六的成功。在遥远的新疆，也在推行无痛分娩法。组织疗法的推行则更早，去年三月中央卫生部发出指示后，九月间又召集了一次全国性的座谈会，总结了推行的经验。根据座谈会上的意见，给组织疗法规定了二十七种适应症，其中多数是慢性顽固性的疾病。这些疾病过去曾使许多卫生机关和医务人员感到难于处理，自从采用组织疗法后，确实解决了一些问题，如支气管喘息的有效率达百分之七十七点一四，消化性溃疡达百分之七十六点二八，瘢痕挛缩达百分之七十五点二八。根据前述座谈会时的统计，全国应用组织疗法治疗了两万八千多人，病例效果在百分之六十至七十之间。经过一年多的研究发展，必有更大成绩，这是可以断言的。但是应该指出，我们在学习苏联先进医学方面还是做得很不够的。特别是有系统地介绍苏联新的医学理论方面更做得不够。譬如在我们的研究工作人员、教学工作人员中间对于巴甫洛夫学说还未能有计划地来进行研究和讲授。我们虽然翻译了一些巴甫洛夫的论文，但还是很零碎的，比较全面的有系统的研究和介绍还没有，这是今后应该加强的。
    我们怎样更好地学习苏联先进医学呢？我想首先要解决一个思想问题，就是要确认苏联医学的先进性，正如它在政治经济方面的先进性一样。只要睁开眼睛多看看现实，这是不难得到证明的。我国旧的医学大多是抄袭英美德日的一套，那是建立在唯心论和机械唯物论的基础上的东西，因而有许多不完全是科学的，有许多是和人民需要脱节的。对于这些东西，我们应该用实事求是的精神进行批判，反对盲目崇拜英美，反对狭隘保守思想，明确认识只有学习苏联医学，我们的医学才有远大的发展前途。
    苏联医学跟其他苏联科学一样，都是在马克思列宁主义思想指导下培养和发展起来的。因此我们要学习苏联先进医学，必须同时学习马克思列宁主义，掌握辩证唯物主义的科学方法，加强为人民服务的思想，彻底进行思想改造。
    医学是一门实用的科学，我们特别强调理论和实际的联系。不要把学习苏联医学停滞在书本上、口头上，而是要用于实际行动，学到一点，就要在实际中运用，并在实际运用中不断作进一步的探求。但同时我们要密切结合中国的实际情况来进行学习，以便区别那些是我们现在就可以学习的，那些是必须创设一定的条件，然后才能作到的，不能机械硬搬。此外，对我们中国医药的优秀遗产和新的创造，也必须加以保存和发扬。
    最后我要特别提出，学习苏联先进医学必须大力消灭医疗事故。因为医学是为人民健康服务的，而医疗事故则损害人民健康甚至危及生命。很可惜，目前全国各地医务机关中医疗事故还相当严重地存在着。产生医疗事故的主要原因可能有三点：一是思想问题，一是制度问题，一是技术问题，而其中思想问题又是最主要的。如果我们医务工作者对病人抱有无限热情，从而以虚心、细心、耐心的态度从事工作，在技术上不懂得的不要自以为是，而要诚恳地向别人领教，不倦地钻研业务，在技术上求得不断提高，加上制度严格，检查认真等等条件，则医疗事故是可以减少和消灭的。爱国卫生运动是我国把医学科学和广大人民群众相结合的一个好的范例。这个运动，不仅粉碎了美帝国主义的细菌战，而且把我们的卫生工作水平大大提高了一步。它极大地改变了我国城乡卫生面貌，提高了人民的卫生知识，减少了疾病的发生率和死亡率，并为今后进一步开展卫生工作创造了有利的条件。我们必须把这个运动更加普遍深入地开展下去，使它经常化，变成人民生活习惯的一部分，以确保人民的健康。我们一方面学习苏联的先进医学，同时不断发扬我国卫生医学工作中的优良传统，并把两者结合起来，我国卫生工作的开展是有无限光明远大的前途的。（附图片）
