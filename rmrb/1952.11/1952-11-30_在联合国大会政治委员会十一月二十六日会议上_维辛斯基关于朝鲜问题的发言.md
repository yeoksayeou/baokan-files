Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 28th: The Soviet delegation has spent considerable effort studying the various proposals put forward in the First Committee. We have analyzed in detail the proposals of the Mexican delegation, the proposals of the Peruvian delegation, the proposals of the American delegation subsequently joined by other countries under American influence, and the proposals of the Indian delegation. Since the last proposal is currently under discussion, my speech today will be limited to the Soviet delegation's views and specific suggestions regarding this proposal.

First, I must point out a situation that surprises everyone, namely that the proposal put forward by the Indian delegation clearly does not take into account the views of either the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea or the Government of the People's Republic of China. My impression is that the Indian government is aware of the Chinese government's views on the Indian proposal, as the proposal was submitted to the Chinese government for consideration in advance, and, according to information I received today, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China submitted its negative response on November 24, its negative opinion on this proposal.

No one here has mentioned this matter. I will assume that the Indian delegation is still unaware of this, as China's reply was sent to the Indian Ambassador to China and, according to my information, was only sent on the 24th, although two days would seem sufficient for the Indian delegation to receive information on the current status of this matter from its government.

Therefore, the first surprising thing is that, fundamentally, the work here is being carried out without considering the opinions of the parties concerned in this matter, which, I regret to say, predetermines that this work will inevitably fail completely. It is like running in place; like a squirrel running around in a cage. If the decisions taken here do not take into account the opinions, positions, and terms acceptable to the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, then I do not believe you can expect any real significance from proposals passed here under such abnormal circumstances. As for the Soviet delegation, it sees no value in such decisions.

On the other hand, let us put aside this question, which, of course, is an extremely important question in itself and should make some people consider whether the correct approach has been taken to solving the problem that is forcing the First Committee to resolve; let us put aside this question, we also need to determine what shortcomings exist in the Indian proposal and what measures should be taken to eliminate these shortcomings. We have already talked about the shortcomings of the Indian proposal. We have also determined our attitude towards this proposal—a negative attitude.

If possible, we would have been happy to adopt a positive attitude towards any proposal concerning such a major and urgent issue as the peaceful resolution of the Korean situation. But that is not the case, and we have taken a negative stance. We continue to vigorously support our proposal, because we are deeply convinced that the recommendations in the Soviet delegation's proposal open up a truly practical path to a truly practical solution to the Korean question; leaving this path, the resolution of the Korean question not only becomes doubtful, but is inevitably doomed to failure in advance.

We have specifically pointed out the major shortcomings of the Indian proposal, and now, on my part, I would like to propose certain amendments to this proposal and suggestions for deleting those provisions that conflict with the principles in the Soviet proposal, that is, the basic propositions.

Regarding the preamble, we believe that the eighth paragraph of the preamble includes the most important and significant thing; we propose to mainly change what is said in the eighth paragraph of the preamble of the Indian proposal to: The United Nations General Assembly "affirms that prisoners of war must be treated with immutable humanitarianism, in accordance with the direct decisions of the Geneva Convention and the general spirit of this Convention."

To talk about non-forcible repatriation of prisoners of war in the current situation where all Korean and Chinese prisoners of war are held in American prisoner-of-war camps, that is, death camps, torture camps, is absolutely absurd. This issue is closely related to our position on this issue, and we have explained this issue as clearly and as thoroughly as possible.

Our first amendment to the preamble is to rewrite the eighth paragraph to the way I just read it, that is, to the way it is written in our draft amendment to the Indian proposal.

This, of course, does not mean that all other points in the preamble are acceptable to us. When we proceed to the vote, we will also present our views on other points. But we are currently only presenting the eighth paragraph of the preamble, because this issue is the most important.

Regarding the proposal itself, or the so-called recommendations, we have heard here that some people like to say that this is merely advisory in nature and does not have any binding force on anyone. I must say that this is absolutely wrong, because the recommendations passed in this way have the same scope and the same degree of binding force as the recommendations passed by the various organs of the United Nations up to the General Assembly. Speaking of the essence of the issue, I must say that, in the opinion of the Soviet delegation, the first point in the Indian proposal, as it is currently worded, cannot be accepted, because the entire issue cannot be reduced to just the repatriation of prisoners of war. We believe that the most important issue is the immediate and complete ceasefire in Korea.

I must point out that all previous speakers, that is, representatives of national delegations—those who spoke here were Chile, Peru, Norway, Iran, and Sweden, that is, the five-nation delegation—none of them mentioned even slightly the necessity of a ceasefire in Korea in their speeches. In other words, they do not care whether the Korean War continues or not.

Mr. Bélandre, who spoke as much as the other four speakers combined—I express my full sympathy to him for this—similarly, he did not say a single word suggesting that Korea must have a ceasefire. Apparently, certain delegations deliberately avoid talking about the Korean situation—they want to talk endlessly, prolong the war with empty talk, and let the grinding stone of war continue to turn, constantly crushing the lives of thousands and tens of thousands of people, who knows exactly how many lives? Perhaps even millions of lives?

Among those speakers who are so-called very enthusiastic to find a way to resolve the war, not a single one has spoken about ending the war. Isn't that surprising? The Soviet delegation cannot consider this situation to be normal.

Our opinion is that the most important thing is to make every effort in this regard. If any of you in your heart consider this opinion to be just, then let him raise his hand in favor of suggesting to both belligerent parties in Korea an immediate and complete ceasefire, that is, the cessation of combat in all aspects—whether on land, at sea, or in the air.

If this amendment is not accepted, then the situation will continue to exist as it is now, and will be prolonged for a very long period of time, depending on the comparison of the armed forces of both sides to determine when it will end; in other words, this issue will basically be transformed into a solution by force, a solution on the battlefield.

This is the method spoken of by General Van Fleet and other important representatives of the United States, which is clearly completely consistent with the views of those who intend to vote against the Soviet proposal advocating an immediate ceasefire to peacefully resolve the Korean question.

We propose to include the following point as the first point of the Indian proposal: "Suggest to both belligerent parties in Korea an immediate and complete ceasefire, that is: according to the draft armistice agreement already approved by both belligerent parties, both sides cease military operations in the three aspects of land, sea, and air; the issue of repatriating all prisoners of war is left to the Committee for the Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Question stipulated in the second point to be resolved, in this committee, the issue must be decided by a two-thirds majority vote of the members," rather than by a committee of four or five people as stipulated in the Indian proposal, because the work of a committee composed in this way is bound to fail, it should be a truly pure Committee for the Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Question as we have suggested, as stipulated in the second point, in this committee, the issue must be decided by a two-thirds majority vote.

This is the first point of our amendment, and this amendment therefore contains the adoption of our proposed immediate and complete cessation of military operations in Korea, instead of the first point of the Indian proposal, namely: the establishment of a four-person (possibly amended to five-person) committee.

We further suggest that, in order to supplement the part of the first point that talks about the Committee for the Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Question, our suggestion should be taken as the second point of the Indian proposal, that is, to establish a Committee for the Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Question composed of representatives of directly concerned parties and other countries—including countries that did not participate in the Korean War—this committee is composed of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, the People's of Republic of China, India, Burma, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and South Korea.

However, if they are to quickly obtain practical and feasible solutions, a condition is naturally required—they need to accept the basic concept that the war must be ended.

Although I do not want to deliver long speeches and talks, I still have to recount the past. I only need to recount that the purpose of the entire policy of the United States, supported by Britain, France, and certain other countries, is not to end the Korean War, but to prolong the Korean War indefinitely, hoping to finally defeat the resistance of the Korean people, turning Korea into a bridgehead for another world war, opening the door for American imperialists to complete their conquest plans.

We believe that the committee composed according to the suggestions in our amendments will be more effective than the committee suggested by the Indian delegation's proposal. I don't want to say much more about the fact that the suggestion put forward by the Indian delegation in the first point of the so-called "recommendations" limits the task of the committee to just the issue of repatriation.

I can imagine you making your decisions. I can imagine such a committee, which violates all logic, starting to work. Then, what will happen? You all know the positions of both sides. The Indian proposal has no other method than to declare that force must not be used. But we say: if you think about the abuse suffered by those so-called people who refuse repatriation under the pressure of coercive means in the repatriation, think about if they refused repatriation after suffering brutal treatment in American death camps, then you can clearly understand that after the forcible screening method was implemented on the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war in American prisoner-of-war camps, it cannot be said that the people who were tattooed had any freedom of will.

Therefore, if the First Committee expects to actually resolve this issue, and does not want to pass some kind of abstract plan that is far from reality and be satisfied with such a plan, then it is naturally impossible to agree to this basic policy adopted on this issue. At the same time, we cannot say that the voice of conscience requires us to take this measure. The voice of conscience first requires the termination of the war. Mr. Bélandre, if you spoke of the voice of conscience not for the sake of rhetoric—scholarly rhetoric—you should have said directly: "The war must be terminated immediately." A pure committee must be established to resolve the Korean question, or to formulate a comprehensive solution to the Korean question, and the Korean question is first of all the question of the unification of Korea; because as long as the South Korean government of Syngman Rhee continues to harbor the emotions expressed here by this reckless young fellow, the Korean question cannot be resolved. I say this young fellow is reckless because he irresponsibly talks nonsense, relying on the support of his American masters, disrupting the atmosphere of the meeting with abuse and threats.

Now there are two basic suggestions. The first is that there must be an immediate and complete ceasefire. This is our first point amendment. The second is that genuine measures must be taken to unify Korea and end the division between North and South Korea. Therefore, we absolutely cannot just establish a committee for the repatriation of prisoners of war as Mr. Menon has proposed in the name of the Indian delegation and consider it done. It must not be done this way. What can we expect this committee to do at that time? Can the issue of the repatriation of prisoners of war be taken as the first step? And it is impossible to do this work from the beginning, because this issue has become the most difficult issue. Logic tells us: doing things must start from the relatively easy, and then do the difficult, from the individual to the comprehensive, from the simple to the complex. You know that the issue of exchanging prisoners of war is one of the most complex and difficult issues, as you all admit. Since this is the case, although you clearly know in advance that this is the most complex issue, you do not pass a resolution for a ceasefire that has become a true path to solving the entire Korean question, you do not establish a committee to seriously deal with the unification and revival of Korea (which also includes the issue of prisoners of war), but instead you extract the issue of prisoners of war and treat it as the central issue. Would a person act this way if he truly hopes to overcome difficulties? I do not believe that there is anyone here who, if he truly listens to the voice of his conscience (I think the voice of reason should also be listened to), can refuse our basic suggestions.

I dare not hope to convince you of the correctness of our position, but I deeply believe that our position is correct. Our position is consistent with the requirements of human conscience and reason, which have not been poisoned by secret plans that are completely incompatible with peace. Therefore, we have proposed two amendments to the Indian proposal, replacing the first point of the Indian proposal with our first point, which is the suggestion of a ceasefire, and replacing the second point of the Indian proposal with our proposed establishment of a committee, that is, the method proposed in the proposal that I have announced here. This committee will be responsible for immediately taking measures to begin resolving the Korean question, in accordance with the spirit of the Korean people unifying Korea themselves.

In South Korea, of course, there are quite a few people from all walks of life who hope that the entire Korea will be truly unified. They are true patriots, completely different from those gentlemen who have spoken shamelessly here in the name of the Korean people and have talked at length about Soviet foreign policy. I think their slanderous remarks are not worth refuting.

We suggest instructing the Korean Unification Committee to supervise the progress of this work and to provide necessary assistance. In this way, it becomes a truly United Nations committee, and not just a committee monopolized by a part of the United Nations, perhaps a very powerful part in some cases.

These are some important suggestions that we have made as amendments to the Indian proposal. In order not to spend too much time, I will not elaborate on the other amendments. Those points all arise from our overall position on the Indian proposal, and we will have the opportunity to elaborate on them later.

We believe that the Indian proposal in its current form is of no use. It is just a waste of time. But perhaps this is the intention of some people—to waste time, pretending to have done something, but in reality, they have done nothing except obstruct the true termination of the war and the peaceful resolution of the Korean question. This is beneficial to some people. They have shamelessly and openly talked about it.

In addition, we suggest changing the first sentence of the third point of the Indian proposal to the following: "A system should be established to ensure that the personal safety, dignity, and self-respect of prisoners of war are absolutely not subjected to any insults, and it is absolutely not permissible, regardless of any form or for any purpose."

On this point, it is necessary to discuss the question that the drafters of the American proposal have tirelessly raised to us: the issue of using force to deal with those prisoners who claim that they will resist forcible repatriation. We have already answered this question. We have shown that a country is ultimately a country, an obligation undertaken is ultimately an obligation, and what measures a country must take to implement the obligations it has undertaken in international agreements is entirely up to that country. We do not doubt that a country always has the power to avoid the excessive actions of prisoners of war, such as those that are now happening in the American prisoner-of-war camps in Korea, in which Korean and Chinese prisoners of war are being shot in batches.

This means that the question must be turned upside down, the question is not whether a country has the right to use force to compel certain people to repatriate, but the question lies in not allowing such a situation to occur: namely: a country using the demands arising from certain people's non-compliance with the obligations that the country has undertaken as an excuse, and therefore supposedly being forced to use force. This means: all responsibility for the excessive actions that are clearly inevitable under the American method lies with the American government, and therefore, it must take all measures to prevent such excessive actions, and it is certainly able to take these measures.

But it is shameful to deliberately provoke such excessive actions and then say "I cannot deal with this situation."

Therefore, we believe that it is incorrect to raise this question. Unfortunately, the Indian proposal also contains the same incorrect question, and out of the voice of our reason and conscience, we oppose this question; we have the right to believe that this is not only the voice of our conscience and reason, but also the voice of the conscience and reason of all peace-loving people in various countries and around the world, the voice of the conscience and reason of hundreds of millions of people who demand that this matter be treated in this way.

Therefore, we say that the third point in the Indian proposal should not be raised in the way it is now. Regarding this point, we suggest that the sentence about the repatriation committee should be deleted, because we are against the establishment of a repatriation committee. A committee should be established as we have suggested in the second point, that is, a new committee, and the issue of repatriation will be handled by it.

The sixth point in the proposal regarding prisoners of war says: prisoners of war will obtain the right to return to their country. We suggest changing the wording of this point, because this is completely not a question of having rights or not having rights. Every hungry person has the right to live, but he just doesn't have the bread to keep him from starving. So this question has nothing to do with the rights of prisoners of war, the question lies in how to create the conditions for them to fulfill their responsibility to return to their country in organizational, material, political, ideological, and moral aspects. We cannot allow a situation that encourages people to adopt this attitude towards their responsibilities. Those who refuse to return to their country must know that a strong and healthy country will continue to function normally without these people, but this involves an important moral and political principle concerning the interests of both large and small countries. We are defending an important principle in international law.

Therefore, we suggest changing the sixth point to: "After classification, all prisoners of war will immediately return to their country, and the parties concerned will provide all kinds of facilities to enable them to return to their country as soon as possible." This amendment is correct also because the Indian delegation mentioned in the fifth point of the proposal the suggestions in a letter from General Kim Il-sung, Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, on October 16. From the suggestions in the letter, it can be clearly seen that the question is not only the technical aspect of the so-called classification, but the political influences and conditions that make classification possible. If the Indian representative truly wants to make his position consistent with the position in this letter, then he cannot use the wording in the sixth point, but must use the wording that we have suggested in the corresponding amendment. The Soviet delegation believes that it is necessary to suggest that points seven to seventeen of the Indian proposal should all be deleted, because these points are all about the responsibilities and activities of the repatriation committee, and the establishment of this committee seems to us to be incorrect, and we strongly oppose it.

These are some of the suggestions that we have made to the Indian delegation's proposal. However, I must reserve the right to speak about this proposal again in the future, and if necessary, I will speak again on certain specific issues.

We believe that the Indian proposal in its current form is of no use. That is just a waste of time. But perhaps this is the intention of some people—to waste time, pretending to have done something, but in reality, they have done nothing except obstruct the true termination of the war and the peaceful resolution of the Korean question. This is beneficial to some people. They have shamelessly and openly talked about it.

In addition, we suggest changing the first sentence of the third point of the Indian proposal to the following: "A system should be established to ensure that the personal safety, dignity, and self-respect of prisoners of war are absolutely not subjected to any insults, and it is absolutely not permissible, regardless of any form or for any purpose."

### 在联合国大会政治委员会十一月二十六日会议上  维辛斯基关于朝鲜问题的发言

专栏：

    在联合国大会政治委员会十一月二十六日会议上
    维辛斯基关于朝鲜问题的发言
    苏联代表团已经化费了很大精力研究在第一委员会提出的各项提案。我们已经详细分析了墨西哥代表团的提案、秘鲁代表团的提案、在美国的影响下其他国家随后参加提出的美国代表团的提案，以及印度代表团的提案。因为现在正讨论的是最后一个提案，我今天的发言将限于苏联代表团对于这一提案的意见和具体建议。
    首先，我要指出一种使每一个人都为之惊奇的情况，那就是，印度代表团所提出的提案，显然完全没有考虑到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府或是中华人民共和国政府的意见。在我的印象里好像觉得，印度政府是知道中国政府对于印度提案的意见的，因为提案在提出之前曾预先提请中国政府考虑，而且，根据我今天所得到的情报看来，中华人民共和国中央人民政府已在十一月二十四日提出了它的否定的答复，它对于这个提案的否定的意见。    此地没有人提到这回事情。我姑且假定印度代表团还不知道这回事，因为中国的答复是送交印度驻中国大使的，而且，根据我的情报是二十四日才送出去的，虽然两天的时间似乎足以使印度代表团从它的政府那里获悉这件事情的现况了。
    因此，第一件使人惊奇的事情就是，从根本上说来，此地的工作都是毫不考虑这个问题的有关方面的意见而进行的，这一点，我很遗憾的说，就预先注定了这个工作必然会完全失败。这好像是一种原地跑步；又像笼子里一只松鼠那样绕圈子乱跑。如果此地所采取的决定，根本不考虑到中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的意见、立场以及能为这两国所接受的条款，那末我觉得你们就不能期望在这种反常的情况下在此地所通过的提案，会有任何真正的意义。至于苏联代表团，它看不出这种决定有任何作用。
    另一方面，我们姑且撇开这个问题不谈，当然，这个问题的本身是一个极端重要的问题，而且应该使一些人考虑到对这个正迫使第一委员会解决的问题是否已经采取了正确的解决途径；我们姑且不谈这个问题，我们也有必要确定印度提案有些什么缺点以及应该采取什么措施来消除这些缺点。我们早已谈过印度提案的缺点。我们也确定了我们对这个提案的态度——一个否定的态度。
    如果能够的话，我们本来是乐于对有关如此重大而紧急的和平解决朝鲜局势的问题的任何提案采取肯定的态度的。但是事实并不是这样，而且我们采取了否定的立场。我们继续热烈地支持我们的提案，因为我们深信：苏联代表团的提案中的各项建议是为真正实际解决朝鲜问题开辟了一条真正切实可行的途径；离开这个途径，朝鲜问题的解决不仅成为疑问，而且必将于事先就注定失败。
    我们曾具体地指出了印度提案的巨大缺点，现在在我这一方面，我愿意对这个提案提出某些修正案和关于删除那些与苏联提案中的原则、也就是基本主张相冲突的各项规定的建议。
    至于序文，我们认为序文的第八段中包括着最主要、最重要的东西；我们建议主要把印度提案序文的第八段中所说的话改为：联合国大会“确认：对于战俘必须按照日内瓦公约的直接决定和这个公约的总的精神，不可改变地表示人道主义的态度。”
    在目前全部朝鲜和中国战俘都被关在美国的俘虏营、也就是死亡营、拷打营内的情况下，要谈不使用武力遣返战俘，这是绝对说不通的。这个问题与我们对这个问题的立场有着密切的关系，而且我们已经尽可能明确地、尽可能详尽地把这个问题说明了。
    我们对序言的第一项修正就是改写第八段，改成我刚才宣读的那个样子，也就是改成我们对印度提案的修正草案中的写法。
    这当然并不等于说序言的所有其他各点都是可以为我们接受的。等到我们进行表决时，我们还要提出关于其他各点的意见。但是我们目前只提出序言的第八段，因为这个问题是最重要的。
    关于提案本身或所谓各项建议，我们在此间都听到，有人喜欢说这只是建议性质，并不对任何人有任何约束力。我必须说一下，这是绝对错误的，因为这样通过的建议与联合国的各机构直到大会通过的建议一样，具有同样范围与同样程度的约束力。谈到问题的本质，我必须说一下，照苏联代表团的意见，印度提案中的第一点如果照它目前的措词，是不能被接受的，因为整个问题不能缩小为只是遣返战俘的问题。我们认为，最重要的问题是朝鲜立即完全停战的问题。
    我必须指出，所有以前的发言者，也就是各国代表团代表——在这里发言的有智利、秘鲁、挪威、伊朗与瑞典，也就是五国代表团——在发言中没有人稍为提一下朝鲜停战的必要。换句话说，朝鲜战争是否继续下去，他们是满不在乎的。
    碧朗第先生，他一个人就讲得与其他四个发言者一样多——这一件事我对他表示十足的同情——同样的，他也没有说一句认为朝鲜必须停战的话。显然，某些代表团故意不谈朝鲜局势——他们要絮絮不休地谈论下去，用空谈把战争拖延下去，让战争的磨石不断地转，不断地碾碎成千成万人的生命，有谁知道确实有多少生命呢？甚至会有上百万人的生命吧？
    在那些所谓非常热心地要想找出一个解决战争的办法的发言者中，竟没有一个人说到过结束战争的事情。这岂不令人惊奇么？苏联代表团不能认为这种情况是正常的。
    我们的意见是：最要紧的就是必需在这方面尽一切的努力。如果你们中间不论那位的心中认为这种意见是公正的话，那末，就让他举手赞成必须向朝鲜交战国双方建议立即并完全停火，那就是停止各方面的战斗——不论在陆地上、海面上和天空中。
    如果这个修正案不被接受，那末，情况就将像现在这样继续存在，并且还要拖延一个很长的时期，要视双方武装部队的对比情况方能决定何时终了；换句话说，这个问题在基本上将转变为由武力来解决，在战场上来解决。
    这就是范佛里特将军以及美国其他重要代表所说的办法，这种办法显然是与那些意图投票反对主张立即停火以和平方式解决朝鲜问题的苏联提案的人的观点完全一致的。
    我们提出建议，把下列这一点作为印度提案的第一点：“建议朝鲜的交战国双方立即并完全停火，即：根据交战国双方所已经批准的停战协定草案，双方停止在陆、海、空三方面的军事行动；遣返全部战俘问题留待第二点中所规定的和平解决朝鲜问题委员会来解决，在这个委员会中，问题必须由委员的三分之二多数票来决定”，而不是由一个像印度提案中所规定的四人或五人委员会来解决，因为这样组成的委员会的工作必将失败，应当是照我们所建议的、在第二点中所规定的一个真正纯正的和平解决朝鲜问题委员会，在这个委员会中，问题必须由三分之二的多数票来决定。
    这是我们的修正案的第一点，这项修正因此包含通过我们提出的立即并完全停止在朝鲜的军事行动的建议，而不是印度提案的第一点，即：设立一个四人（可能修改为五人）委员会。
    我们进一步建议，为了补充第一点中谈到和平解决朝鲜问题委员会的部分，就把我们的建议作为印度提案的第二点就是说成立一个由直接有关方面以及其他国家——其中包括没有参加朝鲜战争的国家——代表参加的和平解决朝鲜问题委员会，这个委员会由美国、英国、法国、苏联、中华人民共和国、印度、缅甸、瑞士、捷克斯洛伐克、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和南朝鲜组成。
    但是，如果要它们迅速获致实际可行的解决办法，自然需要一个条件——需要它们接受必须结束战争这样一个基本概念。
    尽管我不想发表长篇演说和谈话，但是我还是不得不追述一下过去的事情。我只要追述一下，受到英、法和某些其他国家支持的美国整个政策的目的不是结束朝鲜战争，而是无限期地拖延朝鲜战争，希望在最后能够打垮朝鲜人民的抵抗，把朝鲜变成另一次世界大战的桥头堡，为美帝国主义者完成他们的征服计划打开大门。
    我们认为，按照我们修正案中的建议组成的委员会将比印度代表团提案中建议成立的委员会能收到更大的效果。印度代表团在所谓的“建议”的第一点中提出的建议把委员会的任务仅限于遣俘一个问题上，关于这个事实，我不想多说了。
    我可以设想你们作出你们的决定。我可以设想这样一个违反一切逻辑的委员会开始工作。那么，会发生怎样的事情呢？你们都知道双方的立场。印度提案除了宣布不得使用武力外，别无他法。但是我们说：如果你们想一想那些在强迫手段的压力下的所谓拒绝遣返的人们在遣返中所受的虐待，想一想如果他们是在美国死亡营中遭受了残暴待遇后才拒绝遣返，那么你们就可以很明白，在美国战俘营对朝中战俘实行了强迫甄别的办法后，就不能说身上被刺了字的人们还有任何意志自由。
    因此，如果第一委员会期望实际解决这个问题，而不想通过某种远离现实的抽象的方案并满足于这样方案的话，那自然不可能同意在这个问题上采取的这种基本方针。同时，我们不能说良心的呼声要求我们采取这种措施。良心的呼声首先就要求终止战争。碧朗第先生，如果你说到良心的呼声时不是为了修辞——学者气的修辞——的缘故，你应该直接了当地说：“必须立即终止战争。”必须设立一个纯正的委员会来解决朝鲜问题，或拟出全盘解决朝鲜问题的办法，而朝鲜问题首先就是朝鲜的统一问题；因为只要南朝鲜李承晚政府仍然怀着像这个鲁莽的年青家伙在这里所表现的情绪，朝鲜问题就无法解决。我之所以说这个年青家伙鲁莽，是因为他仗着有他的美国主子撑腰就不负责任地信口雌黄，以谩骂和威胁扰乱了会场的空气。
    现在有两个基本建议。第一个是，必须立即全部停火。这是我们的第一点修正。第二个是，必须采取真正的统一朝鲜的措施，终止南北朝鲜的分割局面。因此，我们绝对不能只设立一个像梅农先生以印度代表团名义提出的遣俘委员会就算了事。一定不能这样做。我们能指望这个委员会那时有什么作为呢？难道能把遣俘问题当做第一步工作来做吗？而一开始就做这个工作是不可能的，因为这个问题已成为最棘手的问题。逻辑告诉我们：做事必须从比较简易的开始，然后再做繁难的，从个别的到全面的，从简单的到复杂的。你们知道，交换战俘问题是你们大家都承认的一个最复杂、最困难的问题。既然是这样，虽然你们事先明明知道这是一个最复杂的问题，但你们不通过一个已成为真正解决全部朝鲜问题的途径的停火的决议，不建立一个认真处理统一和复兴朝鲜问题（这里面也包括战俘问题）的委员会，你们反而把战俘问题抽出来把它当作中心问题。如果一个人真正希望克服困难的话，会这样行事吗？我不以为这里有任何人，如果他是真正倾听他的良心的呼声（我以为理智的呼声也应该倾听）的话，能够拒绝我们这些基本的建议。
    我不敢希望能够使你们相信我们的立场的正确性，但是我深深相信我们的立场是正确的。我们的立场与那些没有受到与和平绝不相容的秘密方案的毒害的人类良心和理性的要求是一致的。因此我们对印度提案提出两点修正，把我们的第一点，就是建议停火的意见代替印度提案的第一点，把我们提出的成立一个委员会的意见，就是我于此地宣读过的提案中所提出的办法，来代替印度提案的第二点。这个委员会将负责按照朝鲜人民自己统一朝鲜的精神，立即采取措施，着手解决朝鲜问题。
    在南朝鲜，当然有相当多的各阶层人民是希望整个朝鲜真正统一起来的。他们是真正的爱国者，跟那几位曾在此地以朝鲜人民的名义大言不惭地发言并曾大谈苏联外交政策的先生完全是两路人。我认为他们的诽谤谰言是不值得加以驳斥的。
    我们建议指示朝鲜统一委员会监督这个工作的进行，并且给以必要的帮助。这样的话，它就成了一个名副其实的联合国委员会，而不仅是联合国中某一部分人，也许在某种情况下还是很有势力的一部分人所垄断的委员会。
    这就是我们作为对印度提案的修正案而提出的一些重要建议。为了不要花费太多时间，我就不来详细叙述其他几点修正了。那几点都是从我们对于印度提案的总的立场产生的，我们以后还有机会加以申述。
    我们相信，目前形式的印度提案是没有什么用处的。那只是浪费时间。但是这也许就是某些人的意图——浪费时间，装出好像很作了一点事的样子，然而实际上除了阻挠真正终止战争及和平解决朝鲜问题以外，却什么事都没有作到。这是对某些人有好处的。他们已经无耻地坦然公开谈出来了。
    另外，我们建议把印度提案的第三点第一句话改成下面这样：“应建立一个制度，保证战俘的人身、人格和自尊绝对不得遭到任何侮辱，不论是出于任何形式或是为了任何目的都是绝对不能许可的。”
    关于这一点，必需论述一下美国提案的草拟人喋喋不休地向我们提出的问题：使用武力以对付那些扬言将抗拒强迫遣返的俘虏的问题。我们已经回答过这个问题。我们已经表明过，一个国家终究是一个国家，一种承担的义务终究是一种义务，而一个国家必须采取什么措施来实行它在国际协定中所承担的义务，则完全取决于这个国家。我们并不怀疑一个国家始终有权力避免战俘的过分行动，像现在在朝鲜的美国战俘营中所发生的那种过分行动，而在这些美国战俘营中，朝中战俘是被成批地枪杀的。
    这意味着这个问题必须被倒过来，这个问题不是
    一个国家是否有权力使用武力强迫某些人遣返的问题，而问题在于不容许发生这种情况：即：一个国家利用某些人不顺从该国所承担的义务所产生的要求为饰词，因而据说被迫使用武力。这意味着：照美国办法显然不可避免的过分行动的全部责任，都在于美国政府，因此，它必须采取一切措施来防止这种过分行动，而它也是一定能采取这措施的。
    但如故意挑拨起这种过分行动，然后说“我无法对付这种情况”，这是可耻的。
    所以，我们认为提出这种问题是不正确的。不幸印度提案中也包含了同样不正确的问题，而出于我们的理性和良心的呼声，我们反对这个问题；我们有权利相信这不仅是我们的良心的呼声和理性，也是各个国家和全世界人民中所有爱好和平的人民的良心的呼声和理性，是亿万要求以这种态度来对待这种事情的人的良心的呼声和理性。
    所以，我们说印度提案中的第三点不应当照现在这样提出。关于这一点，我们建议关于遣返委员会的一句句子应予删去，因为我们反对成立一个遣返委员会。应当成立一个像我们在第二点中所建议的委员会，就是，一个新的委员会，遣返问题将由它来处理。
    提案中关于战俘的第六点说：战俘将取得回国的权利。我们建议改变这一点的提法，因为这完全不是一个有权利没权利的问题。每一个饥饿的人都有活下去的权利，但是他就是没有使他不致饿死的面包。所以这个问题与战俘的权利根本没有什么关系，问题在于如何在组织、物质、政治、思想和道义各方面创造使他们得以尽到回国的责任的条件。我们不能容许一种鼓励人们对他们的责任采取这种态度的情况。那些拒绝回国的人必然知道，一个强大健全的国家没有他们这些人也会照样过下去的，但是这里涉及一个关乎大小国利益的重要的道义上和政治上的原则。我们是在维护国际法中一个重要原则。
    所以，我们建议把第六点改成：“在分类以后，所有战俘将立刻回国，有关方面将提供种种便利条件使他们能够尽早回国。”这样修改之所以正确，还因为印度代表团在提案的第五点中提到了朝鲜人民军总司令金日成将军以及中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军在十月十六日的一封信里的建议。从信里的建议中可以很清楚地看得出，问题不仅在于所谓分类的技术方面，而是在于使分类成为可能的政治影响和条件。如果印度代表真要使他的立场符合这封信的立场，那末他就不能用他在第六点中那种提法，而必得用我们在相应的修正中所建议的那种提法。苏联代表团认为必须建议，把印度提案的第七点到第十七点全部删去，因为这几点都是关于遣返委员会的职责和活动的问题，而这个委员会的成立在我们看来是不正确的，并且是我们坚决反对的。
    这就是我们对印度代表团提案所提出的一些建议。不过，我必须保留以后再谈到这个提案的权利，如果有必要的话，我将再就某些具体的问题发言。
