(Xinhua News Agency dispatch) The national judicial reform movement is gradually deepening across the country. The movement is progressing relatively quickly in East China. With the exception of Zhejiang Province, other provinces and cities have completed the organizational rectification of the People's Courts and the supplementary task of ideological remolding. They are now carrying out mass case-handling campaigns and entering the construction phase. People's Courts in the Northeast, Northwest, and Southwest provinces and cities have now completed internal inspections and the work of mobilizing the masses, and are undergoing organizational processing. In the North China region, except for Beijing, which has entered the construction phase, other provinces and Tianjin are conducting inspections within the courts and in conjunction with mobilizing external masses. In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the typical experimental phase has ended in various leagues, and the movement is now fully underway. Judicial reform work is also underway in the Central South provinces and cities.

Over the past three months, the general pattern of judicial reform movements in various places has been: first, cadres are mobilized to study in a guided and planned manner, and policies are clearly explained; then, leading cadres of judicial organs take the lead in conducting inspections, and through the method of typical criticism, all cadres are inspired to expose and criticize old legal views and old judicial styles. In this work, internal inspections of the court are combined with mobilizing external masses to expose and report problems; after the ideological criticism work comes to an end, the stage of organizational handling and judicial construction begins. Experience in various places has proven that areas that have seriously adopted the above steps to carry out the judicial reform movement generally have the following three characteristics:

First, administrative leaders at all levels and the Communist Party Committee attach great importance to this movement, tightly grasp leadership, and assign a group of capable cadres to promote and lead the movement. Chen Zenggu, Vice Chairman of the Guizhou Provincial People's Government, attached great importance to this work, personally presided over the judicial conference of cadres above the level of court president in the province and counties, and personally listened to group reports and urged responsible cadres of provincial and county judicial organs to conduct self-criticism. Therefore, the judicial reform movement in Guizhou Province has been carried out the best in the entire Southwest region.

Second, ideological remolding is combined with organizational rectification, correcting the tendency of one-sided emphasis on organizational rectification and neglect of ideological remolding. In carrying out ideological remolding, the two key points of leadership taking the lead and typical criticism are effectively grasped. In some areas of Shandong Province, the People's Courts did not seriously carry out ideological mobilization and internal inspection in the early stage of the movement, which made it impossible for the movement to deepen. Later, the presidents of the local People's Courts, in accordance with the instructions of the Provincial People's Court, took the lead in making self-criticism, and internal inspections were thoroughly launched. Wang Feiran, President of the Beijing Municipal People's Court, conducted inspections and criticisms at the beginning of the movement. By early October, 39 people from the city and district courts had made key self-criticisms. The leadership organs of the Southern Jiangsu District seized the case of Lu Yasheng, President of the Suzhou Municipal People's Court, who insisted on the old bureaucratic style of "officials never regret judgments" and refused to reverse wrongly judged cases. They convened a meeting of the presidents of county and city People's Courts in the Southern Jiangsu District, where Lu Yasheng made a public self-criticism, thereby correcting the mistaken understanding of old cadres in the district who thought they "had no old legal views." The experience of Shenyang also proves that "typical criticism promotes the overall situation" is an important method for promoting judicial reform. Before the typical criticism, many people did not understand what to criticize or how to criticize deeply. After the typical criticism, this situation was fundamentally reversed.

Third, internal inspections of the court are closely combined with the work of mobilizing external masses to expose and report problems. In the judicial reform movement, the Central South provinces and cities have paid attention to the work of extensively publicizing and mobilizing the masses. Guangzhou organized a work team of more than 100 people and divided them into six districts in the city. By early October, a total of more than 1,700 large and small meetings had been held in the city, with the participation of more than 379,000 people. In addition, more than 6,000 parties and related people were interviewed, more than 130 people were received in various reception rooms, and more than 970 letters of complaint were received. Xi'an mobilized propagandists and grassroots cadres to conduct publicity in various districts in various ways. The city also selected some obviously wrongly judged cases and publicly reversed them, which was very well received by the masses. The mobilization of the masses has powerfully promoted the ideological inspection within the court.

In the judicial reform movement, some People's Courts have shown some gratifying new atmospheres. In places where the ideological inspection within the court and the exposure and reporting of external masses have been done well, cadres have received a profound ideological education, initially demarcated the boundaries between new and old laws, and established a Marxist view of the state and law. On the other hand, in these places, because the People's Courts have attached importance to the work of mobilizing the masses, the masses dare to expose the bad elements in the courts and the old legal views and old judicial styles of judicial personnel, and are also willing to assist and supervise the work of the courts, which marks that the People's Courts are more closely connected with the masses, and the prestige of the People's Courts is further enhanced. In many courts, some bad elements who endanger the people and corrupt discipline have been eliminated, and some incompetent cadres have also been transferred and changed jobs; at the same time, a group of cadres loyal to the people's cause has been added. As of the end of September, a total of 2,105 cadres had been transferred to judicial organs in the East China region, including workers, peasants, and young intellectuals. Women cadres accounted for about one-third. Another important gain brought about by the judicial reform movement in these areas is the establishment or improvement of various judicial systems that connect with the people, rely on the people, and serve the people. At present, East China is clearing backlog cases through mass case handling, while Central South is organizing people's tribunals to clear backlog cases. Some areas have established or are preparing to establish and improve the organizations of district and village mediation committees in order to more widely absorb the masses of the people to participate in judicial activities. New systems and new styles of work established on the basis of the spirit of people's democratic rule of law like this are constantly emerging in various places with the further deepening of the judicial reform movement.

    全国司法改革运动逐步深入
    华东区大部省市法院已进入建设阶段
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：全国各地司法改革运动已逐步深入开展。华东各地运动进展较快，除浙江省外，其他各省市已完成了人民法院的组织整顿和思想改造的补课任务，现正开展群众性的办案运动，进入建设阶段。东北、西北、西南各省市人民法院现已结束内部检查和发动群众的工作，正在进行组织处理。华北区除北京市已进入建设阶段外，其他各省及天津市正在法院内部并结合发动外部群众进行检查。内蒙古自治区各盟已结束典型试验阶段，运动正全面展开。中南各省市的司法改革工作也正在进行中。
    三个多月来，各地开展司法改革运动的一般规律是：首先有领导、有计划地动员干部学习，讲清政策；然后由司法机关领导干部带头进行检查，并通过典型批判的方法，启发全体干部揭露和批判旧法观点和旧司法作风，在这一工作中，法院内部的检查是和发动外部群众揭发检举相结合进行的；在思想批判工作告一段落后，即进入组织处理和司法建设的阶段。各地经验证明，凡认真采取上述步骤开展司法改革运动的地区，一般都具备着下列三个特点：
    第一、各级行政首长和中共党委对这一运动充分重视，抓紧领导，并配备一批得力干部来推动和领导运动的进行。贵州省人民政府副主席陈曾固对这
    一工作非常重视，亲自主持全省、县法院院长以上干部的司法会议，并亲自听取小组汇报，督促省、县司法机关负责干部进行检讨，因此，贵州省的司法改革运动在西南全区范围内开展得最好。
    第二、思想改造与组织整顿结合进行，纠正了片面重视组织整顿、忽视思想改造的偏向。在进行思想改造中，又切实掌握了领导带头和典型批判两个关键。山东省有些地区的人民法院，在运动初期没有认真进行思想动员和内部检查，致使运动深入不下去，以后当地人民法院院长遵照省人民法院指示，带头作了检讨，内部检查才深入展开。北京市人民法院院长王斐然在运动开始时就作了检查批判，到十月上旬，市、区各级法院已有三十九人作了重点检查。苏南区领导机关抓住苏州市人民法院院长吕亚声坚持“官无悔判”的旧衙门作风、拒绝改判错判案件的事例，召开了苏南区县、市人民法院院长会议，由吕亚声当众检讨，从而纠正了该区老干部自以为“没有旧法观点”的错误认识。沈阳市的经验也证明：“典型批判，推动全盘”是推进司法改革工作的一个重要方法，该院在典型批判前，许多人搞不清要检讨什么，或者怎样才能批判得深透，典型批判后，基本上扭转了这种情况。
    第三、法院内部的检查和发动外部群众揭发检举的工作密切结合进行。中南各省市在司法改革运动中都注意了广泛宣传发动群众的工作。广州市组织了一百多人的工作队分到全市六个区，到十月上旬止，在全市共召开大小会议一千七百多次，参加群众达三十七万九千多人。另外又访问当事人及有关群众六千多人，各接待室接待群众一百三十多人，收到检举信九百七十多件。西安市动员了宣传员和基层干部在各区普遍采用各种方式进行宣传，该市并选择一些显然错判的案件当众进行改判，群众反映极好。群众的发动，有力地推动了法院内部的思想检查。
    在司法改革运动中，目前有些人民法院已呈现出一些可喜的新气象。凡是法院内部的思想检查和外部群众的揭发检举工作做得好的地方，干部都受到一次深刻的思想教育，初步划清了新旧法律的界限，树立了马克思主义的国家观和法律观。另一方面，在这些地方，由于人民法院重视了发动群众的工作，因此群众就敢于检举法院中的坏分子和司法人员的旧法观点、旧司法作风，又勇于协助和监督法院的工作，这就标志着人民法院与群众联系更加密切，人民法院的威信更加提高。在许多法院中，一些危害人民、败坏法纪的坏分子已被清除，一些不称职的干部也已调动转业；同时增加了一批忠实于人民事业的干部。华东区到九月底止调进司法机关的干部共达二千一百零五人，其中包括工人、农民和青年知识分子。妇女干部约占三分之一左右。在这些地区，司法改革运动所带来的另一重要收获是：建立了或健全了联系人民、依靠人民、为人民服务的各种司法制度。目前华东区正通过群众办案的方式来清理积案，中南区则组织人民法庭清理积案，还有些地区已经或正在准备建立、健全区村调解委员会的组织，以便更广泛地吸收人民群众参加司法活动。像这类在人民民主法治精神基础上建立起来的新制度和新作风，正随着司法改革运动的进一步深入而在各地不断出现。
