Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 21st (TASS dispatch): General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Ulbricht, delivered a speech on the German reunification issue at a meeting of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. In his speech, Ulbricht answered the questions raised by West German residents regarding what direct measures could be taken to reunify Germany. He said: First, representatives from East and West Germany should advocate for an early Four-Power Conference. The convening of the Four-Power Conference should not be delayed by agenda issues. Because the issues of national reunification, treaty conclusion, and the withdrawal of occupying forces from Germany are of utmost importance to Germany, these issues can and must be discussed and resolved simultaneously. In order for representatives from all of Germany to participate in the Four-Power Conference, it is desirable to convene a joint meeting of representatives from the East and West German parliaments. Second, we are in favor of preparing for all-German elections. Anyone who takes all-German elections seriously should support the formation of an all-German committee composed of representatives from the East and West German parliaments to jointly draft an election law. Third, the Federal Council (formerly translated as Federal Parliament) has not yet responded to the People's Chamber's (formerly translated as People's Parliament) proposal. This matter shows that the United States and Britain, as well as the Adenauer government, are using strong pressure to prevent the Bonn Federal Council from discussing the People's Chamber's proposal. Therefore, the patriotic forces of West Germany must express their will and force the Bonn Federal Council to express its opinion.

Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd: Amidst the strong wave of resolute opposition from the people of West Germany against the ratification of the "General Treaty" and the "European Defense Community" agreement, West German traitorous Prime Minister Adenauer suffered a serious defeat in the Bundestag this week. On November 18th, the Bonn Bundestag, by a vote of 179 to 166, rejected Adenauer's motion to finalize the ratification of the "General Treaty" and the "European Defense Community" agreement on November 26th and 27th. In the vote, about twenty members of Adenauer's own Christian Democratic Party deserted him, and another fifty-three members "disappeared" when voting began. The Associated Press acknowledged that this was Adenauer's "most politically devastating defeat."

This situation greatly shocked the U.S. government. An Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 19th stated: "U.S. officials are gloomily admitting" that "long-term negotiations to rearm West Germany are on the verge of collapse." The Associated Press dispatch also said: "This vote, which almost amounts to a vote of no confidence in Prime Minister Adenauer, has shaken U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Acheson, who fear that further delays will indefinitely hinder the plan to arm West Germany."

    德国统一社会党总书记、民主德国副总理乌布利希
    就德国统一问题发表演说答复西德人民
    阿登纳要波恩众议院月底批准两项卖国条约的企图失败
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十一日讯：德国统一社会党中央委员会总书记、德意志民主共和国副总理乌布利希在德国统一社会党中央委员会会议上就德国统一问题发表演说。乌布利希在演说里答复了西德居民所提出的关于采取何种直接的措施可以使德国重新统一的问题，他说：一、东德和西德的代表应该主张及早召开四大国会议。召开四大国会议不应因议程问题而耽搁下来。因为全国统一、缔结和约、占领军撤出德国这些问题，是对德国具有非常重要性的问题，这些问题可能同时而且必须同时讨论，予以解决。为了使全德的代表们得以参加四大国会议，召开东德和西德代表联席会议是大家所希望的。二、我们赞成筹备全德选举。凡对全德选举抱严肃态度的人，都应该赞成由东德和西德议院代表组成一个全德委员会，来共同拟订选举法。三、联邦议院（前译联邦议会）还没有答复人民议院（前译人民议会）的建议，这件事表明了：美国和英国以及阿登纳政府，正在使用强大压力，阻止波恩联邦议院讨论人民议院的建议。因此，西德的爱国力量必须表明自己的意志，迫使波恩联邦议院表示意见。
    【新华社二十二日讯】在西德人民坚决反对批准“一般性条约”和“欧洲防务集团”协定的强大浪潮下，西德卖国总理阿登纳本星期在众议院中遭到了一次严重的失败。十一月十八日，波恩众议院以一百七十九票对一百六十六票否决了阿登纳要求在十一月二十六日和二十七日最后批准“一般性条约”和“欧洲防务集团”协定的议案。在表决中，阿登纳自己的基督教民主党中约有二十个议员背弃了他，另外有五十三个议员在开始投票时“不见了”。合众社的消息承认：这是阿登纳“政治上最惨的失败”。
    这种情况使美国政府大为震惊。合众社十九日发自华盛顿的消息却说：“美国官员忧郁地承认”，“重新武装西德的长期谈判已处在破裂的危机之中”。合众社的消息并说：“这次几乎等于对阿登纳总理表示不信任的表决，震撼了包括美国国务卿艾奇逊在内的美国官员，他们害怕再拖延下去就会无限期地妨碍武装西德的计划。”
