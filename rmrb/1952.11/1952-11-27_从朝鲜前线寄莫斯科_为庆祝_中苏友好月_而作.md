    Sent from the Korean Front to Moscow
    —Written to Celebrate the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month"
    Liu Baiyu
    Dear Soviet Comrades!
    On this great 35th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, in these days that demonstrate the unparalleled close friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, please allow me to express our most cherished feelings from the Korean front. Whenever the front is mentioned, you can imagine that this represents not just my feelings, but the feelings of countless brothers at the front.
    Today, November 7th, the first snow is dancing in the Korean sky. The hearts of us at the front are stirred and gladdened by the chimes of the Kremlin. We all grew up in the glorious light of the October Revolution, and we stand up and fight under the tutelage of our beloved Comrade Mao Zedong. For many years, on the fiery road of combat and advancement, we have been inspired by the brilliant light of Moscow, both for the great ideal of our national liberation. This not only refers to the past, but more importantly to today: In 1950, when the blizzard was blowing through the flames, when the American bandits were causing the blood of the Korean people to flow freely, a soldier of our volunteer army said: "We have gained happiness, we cannot watch the Korean people suffer disaster." Because we remember how the Soviet people shed their own blood in 1945 when annihilating the Japanese Kwantung Army that invaded our Northeast. The people of the great socialist country not only give us hope, but also give us an example. The outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, carrying the excellent qualities of our nation, also carry the precious virtues of communism. This is the connection between Yang Gensi, who embraced explosives and rushed towards the enemy, sacrificing his life on the Korean front line, and Matrosov, who frightened the German fascists in the Soviet Patriotic War. A soldier of ours fought fiercely on Dead Eagle Ridge for several days and nights. He was frozen stiff by the ice and snow, and his whole body was burned by the bombs. He had already fallen into a coma, but he still asked: "Where are my group comrades? Let me touch them with my hand! (But his hand could no longer move.) Comrades! We must be together, we swore an oath, we fought very well, we will not leave, come! One, two, three, let's sing the Internationale,..." Our infinitely loyal soldiers fight so heroically.
    We love our motherland, and the motherland is as warm as the sun in our hearts. I was once with several people who came from the Huai River area: a company commander, in an emergency, took out a letter from home sent from the banks of the Huai River, and he gained strength. In the past, he had suffered all the disasters of the Huai River, but today the Huai River casts the light of happiness upon him; another soldier also remembered during the battle that he had participated in the construction of the Huai River water conservancy project, and then came from the fertile wheat fields to the Korean front. But we also remember that the huge project that emerged on the disaster-stricken river cannot be separated from the hard work of the Soviet engineers sent by Comrade Stalin. And when the news of the opening of the Volga-Don Canal named after Lenin came to the Korean front, I was in an artillery unit in a forest. At that time, we felt that our entire forest was illuminated and bright, and the soldiers celebrated and sang, because we knew that the success of the great communist construction on Soviet soil also contained our future hope. Precisely because we love our motherland, we can also love our brotherly countries the most.
    Not long ago, I and a combat hero were sitting in a bunker on the front line. Because he and I had both been to Moscow, we talked about Red Square, the Kremlin, factories and collective farms, and the beautiful mornings on the Soviet land. Dear Soviet brothers! Comrades! You know how profound the meaning of this kind of conversation is to us in this place where artillery fire never stops, and you know how precious and forever unforgettable it is for us to read Comrade Stalin's great work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," Comrade Stalin's speech at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and Comrade Malenkov's report at this Congress, word by word, in this place where artillery fire never stops. We know that when the Soviet Union moves towards communism, this is a major and decisive advance and victory in our revolutionary struggle. Today, we face the American invading army. The American bandits are brutal, but how do our soldiers respond to them? Our soldiers said: "Now I have personally seen the brutal behavior of the American bandits in Korea. Now the parents of Korea are our parents, the disasters of Korea are our disasters, and we are determined to strike the invaders!" At this time, the glorious victory of Comrade Stalin and the great Soviet construction gives us unparalleled encouragement; this forms the kind of belief that burns like fire in our soldiers on countless offensives. Because we know that the victory of the Soviet Union is a huge impetus for all struggles for peace, democracy and liberation in the world.
    The sun shines on the continent and the ocean with unparalleled brilliance, and people are advancing on the road illuminated by the sun. Dear Soviet brothers! Comrades! Let us advance in the brilliant light of the great Marxism-Leninism!

    从朝鲜前线寄莫斯科
    ——为庆祝“中苏友好月”而作
    刘白羽
    亲爱的苏联同志们！
    在这伟大的十月社会主义革命三十五周年，在这表现着中苏人民无比亲密友谊的日子里，请允许我从朝鲜前线，表示我们最珍重的感情。只要提到前线，你们想得到，这就不仅仅表示着我一个人，而表示着前线无数兄弟们的感情的。
    今天，十一月七日，雪第一次飘舞在朝鲜天空上。我们前线上的人，整个心情，都为克里姆林的钟声激动着、快乐着。我们都是在十月革命胜利光辉中生成长大的，我们在我们亲爱的毛泽东同志教养下站起来战斗。多少年来，在火焰般战斗前进的道路上，我们为了我们祖国解放的远大理想，同时，也为了莫斯科闪耀的光明而振奋着。这不仅仅指的是过去，更重要的是今天：在一九五○年，当大风雪吹着火光的时候，当美国强盗使朝鲜人民鲜血横流的时候，我们志愿军一个战士说：“我们得到了幸福，不能看着朝鲜人民受灾难。”因为我们记得，在一九四五年，当歼灭侵略我国东北的日本关东军时，苏联人民曾经怎样流出自己的鲜血。伟大的社会主义国家人民，不仅仅给我们以希望，同时给我们以榜样。我们中国人民的优秀儿女，带着我们民族优秀的素质，同时也带着共产主义可贵的品德。这就是在朝鲜火线上，抱着炸药，冲向敌人，贡献出自己生命的杨根思，和在苏联卫国战争中，吓倒德国法西斯的马特洛索夫之间的联系。我们一个战士在死鹰岭上奋战了几昼夜，冰雪把他冻得僵硬，炸弹又烧毁全身，他已昏迷过去，他还问：“我小组的同志呢？让我用手摸一摸吧！（可是他的手已不能动弹）同志！我们一定要在一起，我们宣过誓，我们打得很好，我们不走，来！一，二，三，我们唱国际歌，……”我们无比忠诚的战士是这样英勇作战的。
    我们是热爱我们祖国的，祖国在我们心中如同太阳一样温暖。我曾经和几个从淮河上来的人在一起：一个连长在紧急情况下，他拿出从淮河边寄来的家信，他就有了力量，过去他受尽淮河的灾难，今天淮河对他投来幸福的光芒；另一个战士在战斗中也记着，他参加了建筑淮河水利工程，而后从丰饶的麦田地里走来朝鲜前线。可是我们同时也记得，在灾难河流上所出现的巨大工程，是和斯大林同志派来的苏联工程师的辛勤劳碌无法分开的。而以列宁名字命名的伏尔加河—顿河运河的通航消息来到朝鲜前线时，我正在一个森林中的炮兵部队里，那时我们感到我们的森林整个通明雪亮起来，战士狂欢歌唱，因为我们知道苏联国土上巨大共产主义建设的成功，也包含着我们未来的希望。正由于我们爱我们祖国，我们也就能最爱我们兄弟的国家。
    不久以前，我和一个战斗英雄，坐在前线的掩蔽部里，因为他和我都是到过莫斯科的人，我们就谈起红场、克里姆林宫，工厂和集体农庄，以及美丽的苏维埃国土上的早晨。亲爱的苏联兄弟们！同志们！你们知道，在这炮火不停轰响的地方，这种谈话对我们有多么深长的意义，而你们知道，在这炮火不停轰响的地方，我们一句一句又一字一字读着斯大林同志的伟大著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”、读着斯大林同志在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的演说、以及马林科夫同志在这个大会上的报告，这对我们又是多么珍贵而永远永远难忘的幸福。我们知道，当苏联向共产主义迈进时，这是我们革命斗争事业当中，多么重大的、带决定性的前进和胜利。今天，在我们面前是美国侵略军队。美国强盗是残暴的，可是我们的战士怎样回答他呢？我们的战士说：“现在我在朝鲜亲眼看到美国强盗的残暴行为，现在朝鲜的父母就是我们的父母，朝鲜的灾难就是我们的灾难，我们坚决的打击侵略者！”在这种时候，斯大林同志和伟大苏联建设的辉煌胜利，就给予我们无比的鼓舞；这就形成无数次出击道路上，火一样燃烧着我们战士的那种信念。因为我们知道，苏联的胜利，对于世界上一切争取和平、民主与解放的斗争，都是多么巨大的推动。
    太阳以无比的灿烂光芒照耀着大陆与海洋，人们在太阳照亮的道路上前进。亲爱的苏联兄弟们！同志们！让我们在伟大的马克思、列宁主义的光辉照耀中前进吧！
