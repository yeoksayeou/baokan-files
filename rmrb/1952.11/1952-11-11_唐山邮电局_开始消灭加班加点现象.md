    Tangshan Post and Telecommunications Bureau
    Begins to Eliminate Overtime
    To the Editor: After the People's Daily published Comrade Yang Zifeng's criticism of the Tangshan Post and Telecommunications Bureau's overtime work in the production competition in the "Letters from Readers" column on September 19th, we immediately organized a work team to go to Tangshan twice for inspection and assisted the bureau in adjusting unreasonable labor organization. The inspection results proved that the situation reflected by Comrade Yang Zifeng was basically correct.
    Why did the problem of excessive overtime occur? First of all, it was the bureaucracy of the bureau's leadership, who did not go deep into the grassroots to understand the actual situation of the workers, and only paid attention to completing production tasks, while ignoring the health of the workers. They knew that there was overtime, but they did not take effective measures to solve it. Secondly, the labor organization was unreasonable, and the work system was chaotic, resulting in uneven distribution of labor and rest and overtime. In addition, in production management, there was a lack of clear indicators, and even if there were indicators, they failed to increase with the improvement of production efficiency.
    We have resolved the problems found in this inspection appropriately. At present, the working hours of the Tangshan Post and Telecommunications Bureau's dispatch and receiving department have been adjusted to a maximum of no more than eight and a half hours. They are also studying changing the routes for delivery personnel in order to adjust their working hours.

### 唐山邮电局  开始消灭加班加点现象

    唐山邮电局
    开始消灭加班加点现象
    编辑同志：人民日报九月十九日“读者来信”栏刊登杨紫枫同志对唐山邮电局在生产竞赛中加班加点的批评以后，我们即组织了工作组两次赴唐山检查，并协助该局调整不合理的劳动组织。检查结果证明杨紫枫同志所反映的情况，基本上是正确的。
    为什么会发生加班加点过多的问题呢？首先是该局领导方面的官僚主义，不深入下层了解职工的实际情况，只重视完成生产任务，而忽视职工的身体健康。他们明知道加班加点，也没有采取有效措施给以解决。其次是因为劳动组织不合理，工作制度混乱，造成劳逸不均、加班加点现象。另外，在生产管理工作上，缺乏明确的指标，即便有指标，也未能随着生产效率的提高而提高。
    对这次检查出来的问题，我们都分别作了适当解决。目前唐山邮电局封发部门的工时已调整为最长不超过八小时半。投递人员的工时，他们也正在研究改变线路，以便调整。
