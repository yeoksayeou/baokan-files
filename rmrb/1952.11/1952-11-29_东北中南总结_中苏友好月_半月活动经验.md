Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 27th. To summarize the achievements and experiences of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities in Northeast China in the past half month, the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee convened a meeting of the heads of propaganda departments of provincial and municipal party committees on the 23rd. The meeting summarized the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities in the entire region.

The "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities in the entire Northeast region were extensive in scale, lively in form, and enthusiastic in the masses. More than 20 million people in the region have participated in this activity, further developing and consolidating the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. At the same time, people from all walks of life have strengthened their confidence in learning from the Soviet Union and building the motherland, adding impetus to various tasks. However, the development of the movement is not balanced enough. In terms of breadth and depth, the countryside is not as good as the factories, and the small cities are not as good as the big cities. Therefore, we must continue to work hard on the existing foundation, not only to achieve "known to every household", but more importantly, to "penetrate into the hearts of the people" in order to effectively improve the consciousness of the masses and promote various tasks.

In light of this situation, the meeting held the following views on future "Sino-Soviet Friendship" activities in the entire Northeast region: all activities must be closely integrated with the current central tasks and promote the progress of various tasks. In factories, various activities should be used to systematically introduce the construction achievements of the Soviet Union, further enhance the enthusiasm of workers to learn from advanced Soviet experience, and specifically organize the promotion of various advanced Soviet experiences. It is necessary to establish the view that all cadres, technicians, and workers must learn from the Soviet Union, and maintain the enthusiasm for learning from the Soviet Union and turn it into a force to promote production. In rural areas, it is necessary to combine party consolidation with education on the two roads of rural economic development in order to promote the work of rectifying mutual aid and cooperative organizations. At present, in addition to continuing to carry out Sino-Soviet friendship propaganda activities to the broad masses of peasants, we must also attach importance to propaganda and education for all party members and activists who will be trained soon. For example, when explaining the second of the eight conditions for party member standards in the party member training class, we can connect it with the development of the Soviet Union; and we should report to them the international situation. Cadres at all levels in the entire region, especially cadres above the intermediate level, should be organized to study the main documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), especially Stalin's speech and Malenkov's report, and improve the political and ideological level and leadership ability of cadres through this study.

In order to do this work well, we must continue to study the ideological situation of the masses, understand the problems that the masses urgently need to know, and then systematically select and use propaganda materials according to the specific situation, and concentrate on the use of various propaganda tools. In the organization and use of propaganda forces, workers, peasants, and representatives of other classes who have visited the Soviet Union should be invited to give extensive reports and record them for broadcast. It is also possible to suggest that the local Sino-Soviet Friendship Association convene a meeting of members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association to make the members active advocates of Sino-Soviet friendship.

The meeting also believed that this activity should not only be universally in-depth and set off a wave of learning from the Soviet Union, but also combine this activity with the rectification and expansion of the organization of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, so that this organization can be consolidated and developed, in order to create favorable conditions for better learning from the Soviet Union in the future.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 28th. The Central South and Wuhan "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" Office, in order to further deepen the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" work in Wuhan City, convened a joint meeting of the directors of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" offices in various districts and units of Wuhan City on November 25th. The meeting was chaired by Zhao Yimin, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central South Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Director of the Central South and Wuhan "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" Office.

The meeting believed that the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" in Wuhan City has achieved certain results. The broad masses have received Sino-Soviet friendship education, have a better understanding of the Soviet Union, and understand the superiority of the Soviet socialist system, which has played a certain role in inspiring the masses and promoting various tasks. However, at present, the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" in Wuhan City lacks detailed ideological education work and has not yet achieved "known to every household". Some unit leaders emphasize central tasks such as increasing production and practicing economy and democratic reform, and neglect the work of "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month". Therefore, the development of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" is unbalanced, especially the work among street residents is poor. The meeting believed that during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month", it is necessary to concentrate, extensively, and deeply carry out propaganda and education work among the masses. The "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" work does not affect the central work. On the contrary, the propaganda of Sino-Soviet friendship can promote the central work and improve work efficiency and quality.

The meeting pointed out that various districts and units in Wuhan City should continue to work hard to do a good job in the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month". Districts and units with poor work should catch up; units that have done a good job in the previous stage should take another step forward on the existing basis to do a better job.

    东北中南总结“中苏友好月”半月活动经验
    【新华社沈阳二十七日电】为了总结半月来东北各地“中苏友好月”活动的成绩和经验，中共中央东北局宣传部在二十三日召开各省、市委宣传处长会议。会议对全区“中苏友好月”活动作了总结。
    东北全区“中苏友好月”活动的规模是广泛的，形式是活泼的，群众的情绪是热烈的，全区已有两千多万人投入了这一活动，进一步发展和巩固了中苏两国人民的友谊。同时，各界人民都增强了学习苏联、建设祖国的信心，给各种工作增加了动力。但是，运动发展还不够平衡，从广度和深度上来看，农村不如工厂、小城市不如大城市。因此，必须在现有的基础上继续努力，不仅要作到“家喻户晓、尽人皆知”，更重要的是要“深入人心”，以便有效地提高群众觉悟，推动各项工作。
    根据这一情况，会议对今后东北全区“中苏友好”活动认为：一切活动必须紧密结合当前中心工作，并推动各项工作前进。在工厂里，要通过各种活动，系统地介绍苏联建设成就，进一步提高工人学习苏联先进经验的热情，具体地组织推广各种苏联先进经验。要在一切干部、技术人员、工人中树立必须向苏联学习的观点，并且将学习苏联的热情坚持下去，变成推动生产的力量。在农村中，必须结合整党进行农村经济发展两条道路的教育，以推动整顿互助合作组织的工作。目前，除对广大农民继续进行中苏友好的宣传活动外，还必须重视对即将集训的全部党员和积极分子进行宣传教育。如在党员训练班讲解党员标准的八个条件的第二条时，即可联系讲解苏联的发展情况；并应向他们报告国际形势。全区各级干部，特别是中级以上干部，应组织他们学好苏联共产党（布）第十九次代表大会的主要文件，特别是斯大林的演说和马林科夫的报告，通过这一学习提高干部政治思想水平和领导能力。
    为了做好这一工作，必须继续研究群众思想情况，了解群众急需知道的问题，然后有计划地根据具体情况选择使用宣传材料，集中地运用各种宣传工具。在组织与使用宣传力量上，应邀请曾经访问过苏联的工人、农民及其他阶层代表，广泛进行报告，并录音广播。还可建议当地的中苏友好协会召开中苏友好协会会员代表会议，使会员成为宣传中苏友好的积极分子。
    会议并认为这次活动不仅要普遍深入，掀起学习苏联的热潮，同时，还要结合这一活动整顿与扩大中苏友好协会的组织，使这一组织得以巩固和发展，以便给今后更好地学习苏联创造有利条件。
    【新华社武汉二十八日电】中南、武汉“中苏友好月”办公室，为了使武汉市“中苏友好月”工作再深入一步地开展，在十一月二十五日召开了武汉市各区及各单位“中苏友好月”办公室主任联席会议。会议由中共中央中南局宣传部长，中南、武汉“中苏友好月”办公室主任赵毅敏主持。
    会议认为：武汉市“中苏友好月”已经取得了一定的成绩，广大群众受到了中苏友好的教育，对苏联有了更进一步的认识，并理解到苏联社会主义制度的优越性，对于鼓舞群众，推动各项工作起了一定的作用。但是，目前武汉市“中苏友好月”还缺乏细致的思想教育工作，还没有作到“家喻户晓”。有些单位负责人强调增产节约和民主改革等中心工作，忽视“中苏友好月”的工作。因此，“中苏友好月”的工作发展不平衡，特别是在街道居民中工作较差。会议认为：在“中苏友好月”，必须集中地、广泛地、深入地在群众中展开宣传教育工作。“中苏友好月”工作并不影响中心工作。相反，中苏友好的宣传可以推进中心工作，提高工作效率和工作质量。
    会议指出：武汉市各区、各单位应继续努力，把“中苏友好月”的工作作好。工作差的区和单位，应迎头赶上；前一阶段工作作得好的单位，应在已有基础上，再提高一步，把工作作得更好。
