    Magnitogorsk – A Mighty Soviet Steel Fortress

    Magnitogorsk is one of the largest steel fortresses in the Soviet Union. It is situated on both banks of the Ural River and at the foot of Mount Magnitnaya. The area is rich in iron ore and other metallic raw materials, but lacks the coking coal needed for smelting metals. However, Kuzbass, located two thousand kilometers east of the Urals, has world-famous coal mines with abundant coal suitable for industrial fuel. In order to effectively utilize the raw materials from both locations, promote production cooperation between them, and develop the Soviet metallurgical industry, the 16th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), adopted Comrade Stalin's brilliant suggestion to establish coal-metallurgical combines in both locations respectively. In this way, Ural iron ore could be transported by direct train to Kuzbass, more than two thousand kilometers away, and a large amount of coal could be transported back. The Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Plant was built at an unprecedented speed in the history of Soviet industry. Twenty years ago, the first batch of boiling steel poured out of its steelmaking furnaces. When this plant was fully completed, its production far exceeded the total output of all the old metallurgical plants in the Urals. In the years before World War II, the iron smelting volume of the Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Combine was even greater than the total iron smelting volume of Tsarist Russia. After the establishment of the Magnitogorsk plant, modern machine manufacturing, chemical industry, and light industry were also established and developed in the Ural region. Thanks to the efforts of the Soviet people in construction, the Urals has now transformed from a mere mineral-producing area into a prosperous industrial zone and a powerful industrial base.

    The establishment of the Magnitogorsk metallurgical center is of inestimable significance for the industrialization of the Soviet Union and the consolidation of national defense. Siberia and the Soviet Far East, which were originally economically backward, have been developing rapidly due to the enormous assistance from the western industry. During the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union, the Ural industrial zone, centered on Magnitogorsk, demonstrated unparalleled power. It produced tens of thousands of tons of steel, weapons, and a large amount of ammunition, supplying the heroic Soviet army to fiercely annihilate the Hitler fascist invaders. During the war years, the Urals became the main source of special steel and high-quality steel for the Soviet arms industry. The Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Plant produced a large number of tank armor plates and steel cylinders for rocket artillery shells. In 1943, the second year of the Great Patriotic War, the industrial production of the Urals increased by two times compared to before the war, and its proportion in the total industrial output of the Soviet Union increased by 2.8 times compared to 1940. The output of military supplies from the Urals increased by more than five times compared to before the war.

    In the postwar years, the Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Plant has made great contributions to the restoration of the Soviet national economy and peaceful construction. It supplies various machine tools, steel rails, automobiles, and other machinery equipment to all parts of the Soviet Union in large quantities. Now the Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Plant is serving the great cause of communist construction.

    On January 31st of this year, on the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Combine, Comrade Stalin sent a congratulatory telegram to the plant. Comrade Stalin's congratulatory telegram said: "Over the years, the workers of Magnitogorsk have always worked faithfully and selflessly as loyal sons and daughters of our motherland, creating the production capacity of the combine, successfully mastering new technologies, continuously increasing metal production, and gloriously completing the task of supplying metal as stipulated by the Party and the government." To commend the outstanding achievements of the plant's employees in developing industry, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union awarded medals and awards to two thousand outstanding workers, engineers, and technicians of Magnitogorsk.

    Over the past twenty years, Magnitogorsk, this steel city, has also developed greatly. Its urban area has expanded from the left bank of the Ural River to the right bank. In recent years, the urban area has increased fivefold. During the first Stalin Five-Year Plan after the war, a total of approximately 300,000 square meters of housing were built in the city.

    Fifteen years ago, Magnitogorsk had only four schools, but now it has increased to sixty-one. In addition to the Mining-Metallurgical University, the Education and Normal University, and some scientific institutions, the city also has a theater that can accommodate one thousand people, two cinemas, and many cultural palaces and clubs.

    According to the overall plan for the development of Magnitogorsk City, a large department store, a new meat processing plant, a dairy factory, a park, and a large stadium will also be built in the city. A large railway station will also be built on the right bank of the Ural River. A new building will be built for the Mining-Metallurgical University on Metallurgist Street in the city.

    Magnitogorsk is now being greened, with rows of poplars and linden trees growing on both sides of every street. These tree-lined avenues and the many orchards planted by urban gardening enthusiasts have greatly beautified the cityscape of Magnitogorsk. (Attached picture)

    马格尼托哥尔斯克——强大的苏联钢铁堡垒
    马格尼托哥尔斯克是苏联最大的钢铁堡垒之一。它座落在乌拉尔河的两岸与马格尼托山畔。那一带蕴藏着十分丰富的铁矿与其他金属原料，但是缺乏熔炼金属所需的焦煤，而在乌拉尔以东二千公里处的库兹巴斯却有着世界著名的煤矿，拥有大量可充工业燃料之用的石煤。为了有效地利用这两地的原料促进两地之间的生产合作，与发展苏联的冶金工业，联共（布）第十六次代表大会通过了斯大林同志的天才建议，决定分别在这两个地方建立煤炭——冶金联合企业。这样，乌拉尔的铁矿石就能经由直达列车运往二千多公里以外的库兹巴斯，并从那里再运回大量的石煤。马格尼托哥尔斯克冶金工厂以苏联工业史上空前的速度建立起来，二十年前的冬天，第一炉沸腾的钢水就从它的炼钢炉中倾泻出来了。当这个工厂全部完工以后，它的生产量就远远地超过了乌拉尔所有旧冶金工厂的全部产量。到第二次世界大战的前几年，马格尼托哥尔斯克冶金联合工厂的炼铁量更比沙皇俄国时的全部炼铁量还要多了。在马格尼托哥尔斯克工厂建立以后，现代化的机器制造业、化学工业与轻工业也跟着在乌拉尔地区建立和发展起来。由于苏联人民的努力建设，现在乌拉尔已从一个单纯的矿产地变成为繁荣的工业区和强大的工业基地了。
    马格尼托哥尔斯克冶金中心的建立，对于苏联的国家工业化与巩固国防力量，有着无可估价的意义。原来经济十分落后的西伯利亚和苏维埃远东地区，由于得到西部工业的巨大帮助而日益迅速地发展起来。在苏联伟大卫国战争时期，以马格尼托哥尔斯克为中心的乌拉尔工业区更加显示出了无比的威力。它生产了成千成万吨的钢铁、武器与大量弹药，供给英勇的苏联军队去痛歼希特勒法西斯侵略者。在战争的年代里，乌拉尔成了供给苏联军火工业以特质钢与上等钢的主要泉源，马格尼托哥尔斯克冶金工厂生产了大量的坦克钢甲与火箭炮弹的钢筒。在卫国战争的第二年——一九四三年，乌拉尔的工业生产量比战前增加了二倍，在全苏联工业总生产量中所占的比重较一九四○年增加了二点八倍。而乌拉尔所出产的军用品则更较战前增加了五倍之多。
    在战后的年代里，马格尼托哥尔斯克冶金工厂对于苏联国民经济的恢复与和平建设事业作了巨大的贡献。它以各种车床、钢轨、汽车与其他机器装备大量供应苏联各地。现在马格尼托哥尔斯克冶金工厂正在为伟大的共产主义建设工程服务。
    在今年一月三十一日马格尼托哥尔斯克冶金联合工厂建立二十周年的时候，斯大林同志曾致电该厂祝贺。斯大林同志的贺电说：“这些年来，马格尼托哥尔斯克的工作者们一直以我们祖国的忠诚儿女的姿态，忠诚忘我地工作，以创造联合工厂的生产能力、顺利掌握新的技术、不断提高金属产量、光荣地完成党和政府规定的供应金属的任务。”为了表扬该厂员工在发展工业方面的卓越功绩，苏联最高苏维埃主席团特以勋章和奖章颁发给马格尼托哥尔斯克的二千名优秀工人、工程师和技术人员。
    二十年来，马格尼托哥尔斯克这个钢铁城市，也有了很大的发展。它的市区已从乌拉尔河的左岸扩至右岸。近年以来，市区面积已增加了五倍。在战后第一个斯大林五年计划期间内，市内总共建造了面积约三十万平方公尺的房屋。
    十五年前，马格尼托哥尔斯克只有四个学校，而现在则已增加到六十一个。市内除了有采矿—冶金大学、教育与师范大学和一些科学机关外，尚有一个可以容纳一千人的剧院、两个电影院和许多文化宫、俱乐部。
    依照发展马格尼托哥尔斯克城的总计划，还要在市内修建一个巨大的百货商店、一个新的肉品联合制造厂、一个牛奶厂、一所公园和一个大运动场。在乌拉尔河右岸，还要建筑一个大火车站。在市内的冶金工人大街上，将再为采矿—冶金大学建造一所新的大厦。
    现在马格尼托哥尔斯克正在绿化，每一条街道的两旁都生长着成排的杨树和菩提树，这些林荫大道和市内园艺爱好者所栽植的许多果园，大大地美化了马格尼托哥尔斯克的城市面貌。（附图片）
