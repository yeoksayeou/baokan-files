    Hua Dong Military and Political Committee Issues Instructions
    Strengthen the Organization and Leadership of Basic Construction
    Hua Dong Region Holds Basic Construction Conference to Determine Next Year's Tasks
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Hua Dong Military and Political Committee recently issued "Instructions on Strengthening Basic Construction Work in 1953." The instructions first pointed out that the basic construction work in the Hua Dong region has been successful in the past three years, but there are also some serious shortcomings and errors such as blind construction, eagerness for quick results, and hasty actions, which have caused waste and loss of state resources. The facts of the past three years have proved that basic construction work is by no means a purely economic and technical issue, nor is it a narrow business task of a certain department, but an important political task related to the future development of the entire national economy and cultural undertakings. The instructions emphasized that only by mastering everything well from ideological leadership to design and construction can we smoothly complete the major tasks of basic construction this year. To this end:
    1.  We must quickly strengthen the organizational leadership of basic construction. People's governments at all levels and competent business departments must quickly strengthen the competent authorities for basic construction, and should establish special responsible institutions according to the size of the project in order to prepare for construction. The general regulations stipulate that Class A construction units should be equipped with cadres at the commissioner level, and Class B and lower construction units should be equipped with cadres at least at the county level to be responsible for leadership, and equipped with a certain number of political workers and technical personnel to strengthen site management; units that produce and construct at the same time should also establish strong basic construction institutions according to work needs, strictly separate from production units, to implement the responsibility system. In the future, all basic construction units must start construction only after personnel are fully equipped and approved, and those who violate the basic construction procedures shall be punished as violations of discipline.
    2.  We must earnestly do a good job in compiling the 1953 basic construction plan. According to the experience of 1952, the preparation of the plan is too late, which not only affects the completion of the planned workload and causes a large backlog of state investment, but also makes the design and construction crowded in the second half of the year, causing great passivity in the work. Therefore, the people's governments of each province (district) and city must earnestly organize and lead the compilation of the 1953 basic construction annual plan (including the total workload, finance, materials and labor plans, and design documents), and oppose the attitude of "hasty actions" and "perfunctory work." When compiling design documents and annual plans, we must pay attention to ensuring that the quality of the project is not reduced, and at the same time pay attention to increasing production and saving, so that the plan can play a practical guiding role. In order to ensure that the plan is reported on schedule before the end of November of this year, the people's governments of each province (district) and city should clearly list this work as one of the current central tasks of the relevant departments and units, and closely integrate it with the production reform and other movements.
    3.  We must actively expand the design and construction forces, because this is the weakest link in the current basic construction work. Hua Dong not only has to undertake the design and construction tasks of this region, but also has to share the major design and construction tasks of the whole country. Therefore, the Hua Dong region level and the people's governments of each province (district) and city must strengthen the leadership and assistance to the construction engineering departments, and organize, transform and improve the existing public and private construction design and construction capabilities, in order to meet the construction tasks of next year. Architectural talents in government agencies at all levels should be unified and systematically transferred to the construction department to work. The manufacturing, supply and transportation departments of building materials should also effectively cooperate with the needs of the construction tasks. The construction engineering department should also ensure that the basic construction project plans of each department are completed on schedule, so that the state investment can quickly exert its effectiveness on various economic and cultural undertakings.
    4.  We must strengthen the inspection of basic construction. Basic construction work is very specific and meticulous, but the experience in this area is still very insufficient; at the same time, bureaucracy is still an enemy that cannot be ignored at present. Therefore, people's governments and competent authorities at all levels must often organize forces, together with the people's supervisory agencies, to inspect the design of basic construction, especially the actual situation of construction. In addition to paying attention to correcting its shortcomings and errors in a timely manner, the experience and lessons learned from the inspection should be communicated to various places, or published in newspapers and periodicals, or convened meetings regularly to convey and exchange them, in order to achieve the purpose of propaganda and education, accumulating experience and improving work.
    5.  We must strengthen the business construction of basic construction work, and systematically introduce, promote and educate the procedures and methods related to basic construction work, the compilation methods of plans, the technical norms in design, the advanced working methods in construction, etc., improve work efficiency, and gradually establish a complete set of methods and cultivate a batch of cadres to meet the greater construction tasks in the future.
    [Another News] The Finance and Economics Committee of the Hua Dong Military and Political Committee convened the first Hua Dong Region Basic Construction Plan Work Conference from October 10th to 20th. The conference summarized the main experiences and lessons of the basic construction work in the Hua Dong region in the past three years, especially in 1952, determined the tasks and control figures of basic construction in 1953, and studied how to strengthen and improve the business work of basic construction. Tan Zhenlin, Vice Chairman of the Hua Dong Military and Political Committee, gave instructions on the future basic construction work in the Hua Dong region at the meeting.
    After discussion, the representatives clearly realized that basic construction work is arduous, complex and meticulous work, which is not only an economic and technical issue, but also an important political task; thus, they criticized the past "simplification" and "hasty actions" attitude towards basic construction work; they realized the harm of the blindness and dispersion that existed in the past basic construction work, and initially established the concepts of planning and concentration.
    In order to make the representatives more familiar with the basic construction business, the relevant departments made reports on "How to do Basic Construction Work" and "How to Compile Basic Construction Plans," as well as three typical reports on investigation and survey, preliminary design, and technical design. According to the above reports, the representatives conducted extensive discussions on the scope of jurisdiction of basic construction, the organization, powers and regulations of basic construction work, and the revision of the rules and regulations.
    Based on the spirit of seeking truth from facts, the conference determined the basic construction tasks and control figures of local industries in 1953, distinguishing between priorities and urgencies.

### 华东军政委员会发布指示  加强基本建设的组织领导  华东区召开基本建设会议确定明年度任务

    华东军政委员会发布指示
    加强基本建设的组织领导
    华东区召开基本建设会议确定明年度任务
    【本报讯】华东军政委员会最近发布“关于加强一九五三年基本建设工作的指示”。指示首先指出，三年来华东区的基本建设工作是有成绩的，但也存在着某些盲目兴建、急于求成、草率从事等严重的缺点和错误，曾造成国家资财的浪费与损失。三年来的事实证明：基本建设工作绝不是单纯的经济、技术问题，绝不是某一部门的狭隘的业务工作，而是关系着整个国家经济、文化事业发展前途的重要政治任务之一。指示强调指出：只有从思想领导直到设计施工，都很好地加以掌握，才能顺利地完成今年基本建设的重大任务。为此：
    一、必须迅速加强对基本建设的组织领导。各级人民政府及各主管业务部门，必须迅速加强基本建设的主管机构，更应按照工程大小，分别建立专责机构，才能筹办兴工。一般规定：甲类建设单位应配备专员级干部，乙类以下建设单位，至少应配备县长级干部来负责领导，并配备一定数量的政治工作人员与技术人员以加强工地管理工作；一面生产一面建设的单位，亦应按工作需要，建立坚强的基本建设机构，严格地与生产单位分开，以贯彻责任制度。以后各基本建设单位必须俟人员配备齐全并经批准以后方得动工，有违反基本建设程序者应以违犯纪律论处。
    二、必须认真做好一九五三年基本建设计划的编制工作。根据一九五二年的经验，计划编造太迟，不但影响计划工作量的完成，造成国家投资的大量积压，而且使设计施工拥挤于下半年内，造成工作上很大的被动。因此对一九五三年基本建设年度计划的编制工作（包括工作总量、财务、物资与劳动等计划及设计文件），各省（区）、市人民政府必须认真加以组织和领导，反对“草率从事”、“敷衍交差”的态度。在编制设计文件和年度计划时，一面要注意保证不减低工程质量，一面要注意增产节约，使计划能起实际指导的作用。各省（区）、市人民政府为保证于本年十一月底以前将计划如期上报，应将这一工作明确列为各有关部门和有关单位的当前中心工作之一，使它与生产改革等运动密切结合起来。
    三、必须积极扩大设计施工力量，因为这是目前基本建设工作中最薄弱的环节。华东不特要担负本区的设计施工任务，而且还要分担全国设计施工的重大任务。因此华东区一级及各省（区）、市人民政府必须加强对建筑工程部门的领导和帮助，将现有公私建筑设计施工能力很好地组织起来，并加以改造和提高，以便迎接明年的建设任务。各级政府机构中的建筑人才应统一和有计划地抽调到建筑部门去工作。建筑器材的制造、供应及交通运输部门，均应切实配合建设任务的需要。建筑工程部门亦应保证各部门基本建设工程计划如期完成，使国家投资对各种经济、文化事业迅速地发挥效能。
    四、必须加强对基本建设的检查。基本建设工作是非常具体和细致的，可是目前这一方面的经验还是很不够的；同时，官僚主义作风在目前还是不容忽视的敌人。因此各级人民政府及主管机关必须经常组织力量，会同人民监察机构，检查基本建设的设计，特别是施工的实际情况，除及时注意纠正其缺点和错误外，并应将检查所得的经验教训通报各地，或在报刊发表，或定期召集会议来传达交流，以期达到宣传教育、积累经验与改进工作的目的。
    五、必须加强基本建设工作的业务建设，将有关基本建设工作的程序办法、计划的编制方法、设计中的技术定额、施工中的先进工作法等等，进行有系统的介绍、推广和教育，提高工作效率，并逐渐建立起一套完整的办法，培养出一批干部，以迎接今后更大的建设任务。
    【又讯】华东军政委员会财政经济委员会于十月十日到二十日，召开了华东区第一次基本建设计划工作会议。会议总结了过去三年来，特别是一九五二年度华东区基本建设工作中的主要经验教训，确定了一九五三年度基本建设的任务和控制数字，并研究了如何加强与改进基本建设的业务工作。华东军政委员会谭震林副主席在会上对华东区今后的基本建设工作作了指示。
    经过讨论，到会代表明确认识到基本建设工作是艰巨的、复杂的、细致的工作，不仅是经济、技术的问题，更是重要的政治任务；从而批判了过去对基本建设工作采取“简单化”方式与“草率从事”的态度；认识到过去基本建设工作中存在的盲目性、分散性的危害，初步建立了计划性、集中性的观点。
    为使到会代表更加熟悉基本建设业务，有关部门在会上作了“怎样做基本建设工作”与“怎样编制基本建设计划”的报告，以及调查勘测、初步设计、技术设计三个典型报告。代表们根据上述报告，对基本建设的管辖范围，基本建设工作的机构、职权和规则制度的修订等，进行了广泛的讨论。
    会议根据实事求是的精神，分别轻重缓急，确定了一九五三年度地方工业的基本建设任务和控制数字。
