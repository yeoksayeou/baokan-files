    China's First Batch of Rice Sold to Ceylon Has Been Exported
    By Our Correspondent  Fu Dong
    On October 25th, the ship "Xiangli" carrying more than 9,800 tons of Chinese rice sailed from Shanghai to Ceylon. The first batch of rice sold by China to Ceylon has been exported.
    I stood on the Blue Funnel Wharf on the Huangpu River, watching the ship gradually disappear into the distant horizon. I know how much the people of Ceylon need rice, because Mr. Sangaratasan, the representative of Ceylon attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, once told me about the situation in Ceylon: Ceylon needs 600,000 tons of grain annually, of which 400,000 tons need to be imported from foreign countries. Since the outbreak of the Korean War, the United States has been purchasing rice with US dollars to supply the war of aggression against Korea, which has caused great difficulties for Ceylon to buy rice. The Ceylon government sent people to the United States to buy rice, but the US government was very cold; but the US government was very interested in Ceylon's rubber, and tried its best to use its monopoly to keep the price very low. The price of rubber is the lever of Ceylon's economic life. The fall in the price of rubber means lower wages and the contraction of other social undertakings. However, the lives of the people of Ceylon are not of interest to US imperialism; it is most interested in transporting more military supplies into Ceylon's ports and sending more planes to patrol over Ceylon in order to further use Ceylon as a military base.
    In order to solve the problem of grain and rubber, the Ceylon trade delegation came to China in September. Here, they were warmly welcomed and treated. Mr. Sennanayake, the head of the Ceylon trade delegation, said before returning home: "Since we entered the Chinese border, we have been treated with extreme friendliness. We are warmly welcomed wherever we go, which makes us realize at all times that we are with friends." The Sino-Ceylon trade negotiations went smoothly and were quickly signed. China sells 80,000 tons of rice to Ceylon and purchases rubber and other products from Ceylon at the same time. This trade negotiation is fully in line with the principle of "equality and mutual benefit." Mr. Sennanayake, the head of the Ceylon trade delegation, said that the ratio of rice to rubber is very fair and reasonable. Not only that, Mr. Silva, a member of the delegation, also personally visited the No. 4 warehouse of the Shanghai Grain Company to see the rice exported by our country. He nodded and praised: "The rice is very clean, with very few impurities, and very few broken rice. It is even better than the samples I saw in Beijing." The first batch of rice can be shipped in October, which makes the Ceylon trade delegation particularly satisfied.
    When Mr. Silva visited the No. 4 warehouse of the Shanghai Grain Company, he saw mountains of grain piled up in each warehouse. He thought: How can China, which used to import a lot of grain from foreign countries every year before liberation, have surplus grain for export in just three years after liberation? Mr. Silva visited Heping Village and Meilong Town in the suburbs of Shanghai, and immediately understood the reason. He saw that every farmer's family was doing well. The farmers also warmly entertained him with peanuts, water chestnuts, and persimmons. Mr. Silva told me that what impressed him most about the Chinese countryside was the happy faces of the farmers working on their own land. Ma Xiaomei, a female agricultural model in Heping Village, a suburb of Shanghai, once said to him: "Before liberation, my husband and I farmed the landlord's land. The more harvest from the land, the more rent the landlord wanted. After a year of work, we couldn't even feed ourselves, and life became more and more difficult. After liberation, we were allocated four mu of land. My husband and I both joined the mutual aid group. The more we worked, the more harvest we got from the land year by year, and life became better day by day." Mr. Silva also saw the staff of the China People's Bank office in Meilong Town busily issuing agricultural loans to farmers in the nearby five villages. He knew that this was a concrete measure taken by the People's Government to help farmers solve the difficulties of livestock, farm tools, seeds, and fertilizers. Land reform, labor mutual assistance, and the assistance of the People's Government have enabled our country to quickly transform from a grain importing country to a grain exporting country, which Mr. Silva clearly sees.
    Our people are very concerned about the lack of food for the people of Ceylon. Farmers are willing and actually supplied grain, and food processing workers and transport workers in Shanghai accepted the processing and transportation tasks of rice destined for Ceylon with boundless enthusiasm. Huang Wenxu, a technician at the No. 4 Rice Mill of the Shanghai Grain Company, said: "Hearing the news that the people of Ceylon are short of food, everyone is as anxious as if they are hungry themselves. Everyone said, we are living a good life now, with food and clothing, but we can't forget the people of other countries. We must work harder to grind the rice whiter and better, and send it to the people of Ceylon as soon as possible. This is called sending charcoal in the snow, and that's what friends are for!" From October 15th, the red line on the "Output Progress Comparison Chart" of the No. 4 Rice Mill has been rising continuously. On the 15th, 424,200 jin of rice were processed, and on the 19th, it rose to 592,400 jin. The processing contract they accepted stipulated that the moisture content of the rice should not exceed 15% and the broken rice should not exceed 35%; the standard set by the workers themselves was that the moisture content of the rice should not exceed 13% and the broken rice should not exceed 30%. On the wharf of the No. 4 Warehouse of the Shanghai Grain Company, which is more than one mile long, from the 20th, the sound of "Hang yo, Hang yo" was heard all day long. More than 800 workers carrying rice bags, pushing carts, and comrades from the security group also automatically participated in the labor, stamping the "Chinese Rice" mark on the rice bags. They spoke less and did not smoke, and worked nervously and orderly. The warehouse technicians received the task of sifting more than 5,000 bags of grain. They used the method of using a dryer to blow chaff powder instead of the previous sifting method, which greatly improved work efficiency. The number of bags of rice blown per hour gradually increased from 40 to 60. The contract originally stipulated that 1,000 tons of rice would be moved per day, and it was estimated that it would take ten days to complete the move. The porters only used 41 hours and 45 minutes to transport the grain. Their slogan is: Faster, faster! In order to deliver the grain to the people of Ceylon as soon as possible. Mr. Silva saw the workers' enthusiasm for active labor and said to worker Chen Zhongyu with great gratitude: "You have worked so hard and selflessly in order to allow the people of Ceylon to receive food relief as soon as possible. We are very grateful."
    All the workers who participated in this work understood what their work was for. Wang Zhaokun, an old worker at the Blue Funnel Wharf, said that he had been working on this wharf 24 years ago. At that time, he moved foreign rice and flour from foreign ships with sweat and tears. When he dragged his tired body back home, there was an empty rice bowl on the table. His wife and children often got up in the middle of the night to buy rationed grain, holding small pockets and waiting in line in front of the rice shop. They stood in the wind and rain for several hours, and finally a sign of "Rice Sold Out" was hung at the door of the rice shop. Wang Zhaokun pointed to the five-star red flag flying on the ship on the river and continued: Since our five-star national flag was raised in Shanghai, everything has been very different. Now, when he returns home from the wharf every day, there is fragrant white rice on the table, and there are not only green vegetables and radishes in the plate, but also fish and meat. He now earns more than one million yuan a month. He said: "Now the people of our country have turned over, our lives are getting better, but things are not over yet, we also hope that the people of the world will have a good life, and hope that the children of other countries will grow as white and fat as my children!" Wang Zhaokun's words express the will and wishes of thousands of Chinese people. Because of this will and wish, our people sold 80,000 tons of rice to the people of Ceylon who are in urgent need of food. (Attached photo)

    我国售给锡兰的第一批大米出口了
    本报记者  傅冬
    十月二十五日，祥利号轮船载着九千八百多吨中国大米，从上海开往锡兰。我国卖给锡兰的大米中的第一批出口了。
    我站在黄浦江边的蓝烟囱码头上，看着这艘轮船渐渐消失在海天远处。我知道锡兰人民是如何的需要大米，因为出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的锡兰代表桑姆加塔桑曾经对我谈过锡兰的情况：锡兰全国每年需要六十万吨粮食，其中四十万吨要从外国输入。朝鲜战争发生以后，美国用美元搜购大米，供应侵朝战争，锡兰买米就发生了很大的困难。锡兰政府曾派人到美国去买米，美国政府非常冷淡；但美国政府对锡兰的橡胶却很感兴趣，尽量利用它的垄断地位，把价钱压得很低。橡胶价格是锡兰经济生活的杠杆，橡胶价格下落，就意味着工资减低和其他社会事业的紧缩。然而，锡兰人民的生活并不是美国帝国主义感觉兴趣的事情；它所最感兴趣的是把更多的军火运进锡兰的港口，派更多的飞机在锡兰上空巡逻，以便更进一步把锡兰作为军事基地。
    为了解决粮食和橡胶的问题，锡兰贸易代表团在九月间来到中国。在这里，他们受到了热烈的欢迎和款待。锡兰贸易代表团团长沈纳那亚克在归国前说：“我们开始进入中国国境以来，一直受到极其友善的招待。我们不论到什么地方都受到热烈欢迎，这使我们时时刻刻意识到我们是和朋友们在一起。”中锡贸易谈判进行得很顺利，很快地就签了字。中国卖给锡兰八万吨大米，同时向锡兰购买橡胶和其他产品。这次贸易谈判完全符合“平等互利”的原则。锡兰贸易代表团团长沈纳那亚克曾表示，关于大米和橡胶的比价，是非常公平合理的。不仅如此，该团团员席尔瓦还亲自到上海市粮食公司第四仓库看过我国出口的大米，他点头称赞：“米很干净，杂质很少，碎米也很少，比我在北京看的样品还要好。”第一批大米在十月里就能开始启运，这也使锡兰贸易代表团特别满意。
    席尔瓦在参观上海市粮食公司第四仓库的时候，看见每个库房中都堆着像山一样的粮食。他想：在解放前每年都要从外国输入许多粮食的中国，怎么能在解放后短短的三年里，就有余粮出口了呢？席尔瓦访问了上海市郊区和平村和梅龙镇，立刻明白了其中的道理。他在那里看见农民家家都过得很好。农民还用花生、菱角和柿子热情地招待他。席尔瓦告诉我，中国农村给他印象最深的是农民在自己的土地上工作时的愉快的脸孔。上海市郊和平村一位女农业模范马小妹曾对他说：“解放前，我和我丈夫种地主的田。地里的收成越多，地主要的租就越多。干一年活，连嘴都混不住，日子越过越难过。解放后，我们分得了四亩田，我和我丈夫都参加了互助组，大家越干越起劲，地里的收成一年比一年多，日子也过得一天比一天好。”席尔瓦还在梅龙镇看过中国人民银行办事处的工作人员忙着给附近五个村的农民发放农业贷款的情形，他知道这是人民政府帮助农民解决牲畜、农具、种子和肥料的困难的具体措施。土地改革，劳动互助，人民政府的扶助，使得我国迅速由粮食入口国变为粮食出口国，这一点，席尔瓦是看得清清楚楚的了。
    我国人民对锡兰人民缺乏粮食的情况，是非常关心的。农民愿意并且实际供给了粮食，上海市的食粮加工工人和运输工人，以无限的热情接受了运往锡兰的大米的加工和运输任务。上海市粮食公司第四碾米厂技工黄文煦说：“听到锡兰人民缺乏粮食的消息，大伙就像自己饿肚子一样的着急。大伙都说，咱们现在过好日子了，有吃有穿，可不能忘记别的国家的人民。咱们一定加点劲，把米碾得又白又好，赶快送给锡兰人民。这叫作雪里送炭，这才够朋友！”从十月十五日起，第四碾米厂“产量进度比较图”上的红线，就一直往上升，十五日那天加工四十二万四千二百斤米，十九日就上升到五十九万二千四百斤。他们接受的加工合同上订明大米的水份不得超过百分之十五，碎米不超过百分之三十五；工人们自己规定的标准却是大米水份不超过百分之十三，碎米不超过百分之三十。上海市粮食公司第四仓库一里多长的码头上，从二十日起，整天响着：“杭唷，杭唷”的声音，八百多个搬运大米的工人，扛包的扛包，推车的推车，警卫组的同志也自动参加劳动，在米袋上打着“中国大米”的印记。他们话也少说，烟也不吸，都紧张而有秩序地工作着。库房技工们接到淌筛五千多包粮食的任务，他们采用烘干机吹糠粉的办法，代替过去的淌筛办法，大大提高了工作效率。由一小时吹四十包米逐渐增加到六十包。合同原订一天搬运一千吨大米，估计十天才能搬完。搬运工人只用了四十一小时零四十五分，就把这批粮食运完了。他们的口号是：快些，再快些！以便尽快地把这批粮食送到锡兰人民的手里。席尔瓦看见工人这种积极劳动的热情，非常感激地对工人陈忠裕说：“你们为了使锡兰人民早日得到粮食接济，这样不辞劳苦的忘我的工作，我们非常感激。”
    所有参加这次工作的工人，都懂得自己这种工作是为了什么。蓝烟囱码头的老工人王兆坤说，二十四年前他就在这个码头上工作，那时汗一把、泪一把地把洋米洋面从外国人的船上搬下来，等到拖着疲倦的身子回到家里时，桌子上却摆着空饭碗。老婆娃娃为了买配售粮，常常半夜里爬起来，拿着个小口袋，到米店门口排队等候。风里雨里站几个钟头，最后米店门口挂出个“米已售完”的牌子。王兆坤指着江面船上飘着的五星红旗接着说下去：自从我们的五星国旗在上海升起来，一切都大不相同了。现在他每天从码头回到家里，桌子上摆着香喷喷的白米饭，盘里不但有青菜萝卜，还经常有鱼有肉。他现在一个月拿一百多万元工资。他说：“现在我国人民翻身了，我们的生活好起来了，不过事情还没有完，我们也希望全世界人民都有好生活，希望别的国家的娃娃，也都像我家的娃娃长得又白又胖！”王兆坤的话表达了千千万万中国人民的意志和愿望，由于这种意志和愿望，我国人民把八万吨大米卖给了急需粮食的锡兰人民。（附图片）
