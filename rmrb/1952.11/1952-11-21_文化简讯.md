    Nationalities Hygiene Work Team of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government Goes to Work in the Qamdo Area
    The Nationalities Hygiene Work Team of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government departed from Chongqing on the 8th to work in the Qamdo area. The team consists of over a hundred medical workers, half of whom are female midwives. They have prepared for a long period of service to the Tibetan people and are highly enthusiastic about carrying out medical and health work in minority areas. The team will establish a hospital in Qamdo and strategically establish health institutions in densely populated areas of Qamdo; vigorously carry out the prevention and treatment of venereal diseases and maternal and child health care; and train Tibetan health workers. The team is also carrying a sufficient quantity of various medicines such as penicillin, sulfa tablets, bismuth preparations, as well as instruments and propaganda materials such as slide projectors.
    National Literary Association Holds Lectures
    In order to help members study and enable literary workers to acquire theoretical and practical knowledge from various aspects, the All-China Federation of Literary Workers Associations, in addition to the "Land Reform Movement Report Meeting," "Gao Yubao Creation Problems Symposium," and "Five-Anti Movement Report Meeting" previously held, held two more lectures in October: On October 15th, Comrade Ai Siqi spoke on "Communist Thought and Literary Creation," and on October 28th, Comrade Ding Zan spoke on "The Current Situation of the Chinese Scientific Community."
    In his lecture, Comrade Ai Siqi pointed out that literary workers must arm themselves with communist thought and integrate communist thought with literary creation. Comrade Ai Siqi explained in detail the system of embodying communist thought in creation: it must be implemented in terms of position, viewpoint, and method. He particularly emphasized that literary workers should serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, and reflect the essence and contradictions of current life. He said that the essence of things is important in literature and art because it can point out the direction of action and struggle, raise questions, and solve problems.
    In his lecture, Comrade Ding Zan elaborated on the question of whether natural science has class character. He used vivid examples to illustrate that science in old China blindly followed the science of capitalist countries, causing Chinese science to be divorced from reality for a long time and unable to serve production and construction. He pointed out that after liberation, the Party and the People's Government opened up unlimited broad roads for the development of science, resulting in many new creations, contributing greatly to the construction of the motherland and the development of industry and agriculture. Finally, he suggested that writers create more works that reflect the rapid progress of the Chinese scientific community under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party.
    Central People's Government and Fujian Provincial People's Government Allocate Funds to Repair Revolutionary Sites and Scenic Spots in Fujian
    The Central People's Government and the Fujian Provincial People's Government have successively allocated 260 million yuan to repair revolutionary sites and historical scenic spots in Fujian Province. The Gutian Conference Site in Shanghang County, the execution site of Comrade Qu Qiubai in Changting County, Jin Feng Da Shan—Chairman Mao's recuperation site—in Yongding County, and the Chishi Uprising Site in Chong'an County are four revolutionary sites and Yongquan Temple on Gushan Mountain in the suburbs of Fuzhou City, Nanputuo Temple in the suburbs of Xiamen City, Yuhua Cave in Jiangle County, Zheng Chenggong's place of burning Qing clothing in Nan'an County, and Xuefeng Ancient Temple in Minhou County are five scenic spots that have been successively started, and it is expected that they will all be completed by the end of this year.

    全国文协举办讲演会
    中华全国文学工作者协会为了帮助会员进行学习，使文学工作者能从各方面获得理论知识与生活知识，除前已举行“土地改革运动报告会”“高玉宝创作问题座谈会”“五反运动报告会”外，十月份又先后举行了两次讲演会：十月十五日由艾思奇同志讲“共产主义思想与文艺创作”，十月二十八日由丁瓒同志讲“中国科学界的现状”。
    艾思奇同志在讲演中指出：文艺工作者要用共产主义思想武装自己，要把共产主义思想与文艺创作结合起来。艾思奇同志详尽地说明了在创作中要体现共产主义思想的体系：必须从立场、观点、方法各方面贯彻。他特别强调：文艺工作者要为工农兵服务，要反映当前生活的本质与矛盾。他说：本质的东西在文艺上之所以重要，是因为它可以指出行动和斗争的方向，提出问题，解决问题。
    丁瓒同志在讲演中，阐述了自然科学有没有阶级性的问题。他用生动的例子说明旧中国的科学，在盲目地追随资本主义国家的科学，使中国的科学长期脱离实际，不能为生产建设服务。他指出：解放后，党和人民政府给科学的发展开辟了无限的宽广道路，从而出现了许多新的创造，为祖国建设和工农业的发展贡献了很大的力量。最后他建议作家们多多创作能反映新中国科学界在毛主席、共产党的领导下飞跃进展的作品来。
