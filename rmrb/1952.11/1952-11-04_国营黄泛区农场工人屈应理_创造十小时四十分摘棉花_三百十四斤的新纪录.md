    State-Run Huangfanqu Farm Worker Qu Yingli
    Creates New Record of Picking 314 Jin of Cotton in 10 Hours and 40 Minutes
    Editor: The State-Run Huangfanqu Farm trial-planted 6,926 mu of cotton this year. According to the current cotton picking situation, it is estimated that the average yield per mu can reach 180 jin of seed cotton. How to harvest so much cotton in a timely manner? This has become the most concerning issue for all workers on the farm. In the cotton picking competition, Qu Yingli, a worker from the first production team, took the lead in creating a new record. On October 13th, he picked 314 jin of cotton in 10 hours and 40 minutes of work, more than doubling the average speed of ordinary workers.
    How was this new record created? Qu Yingli said, "I don't have any secrets. When I pick cotton, I always think about how to pick more. I thought: a person has two hands, but we mainly use one hand to pick cotton, and can only pick one boll at a time. I also thought, I have two eyes and two legs, why can't I make full use of them? If the eyes, hands, and legs are used well, two cotton bolls can be picked at once, which can increase the speed of cotton picking. I started using new cotton picking methods. I put all my energy into cotton picking and didn't let my mind wander. My eyes are focused on the cotton fibers, picking out the ripe flowers. Both hands work together, picking only the flowers and not the burrs, avoiding the time wasted on shelling. For cotton bolls with five lobes, use five fingers to pick, with each finger pressing on one lobe, and then concentrating the force to pull it off. For cotton bolls with four lobes, use four fingers to pick. In this way, my cotton picking efficiency has been improved, and I have achieved good results in terms of cotton picking quality and quantity."
    Now this advanced cotton picking method has been promoted throughout the farm. Many cotton picking experts have emerged in the first production team. Zhang Yifa picked 295 jin of cotton in 10 hours and 40 minutes. Li Genmei picked 285 jin of cotton in 10 hours and 20 minutes. Guo Herong from the fifth production team picked 60 jin of cotton in three hours. By October 15th, Zhang Shun had created an even higher record. He picked 328 jin of cotton in 10 hours and 40 minutes.
    Now that state-run farms and farmers are harvesting cotton, we are especially introducing Qu Yingli's working methods for everyone to learn and refer to.

### 国营黄泛区农场工人屈应理  创造十小时四十分摘棉花  三百十四斤的新纪录

    国营黄泛区农场工人屈应理
    创造十小时四十分摘棉花
    三百十四斤的新纪录
    编辑同志：国营黄泛区农场今年试种了六千九百二十六亩棉花。根据目前收花情况估计，每亩平均可收籽棉一百八十斤。怎样把这许多棉花及时收摘下来呢？这已成为当前全场工人最关心的问题。在摘棉竞赛运动中，第一生产队工人屈应理首先创造了新纪录。十月十三日那一天，他在十小时四十分的工作时间内，摘棉三百十四市斤，比一般工人的平均速度提高了二倍多。
    这个新纪录怎么创造出来的呢？屈应理说：“我什么秘诀也没有，我在摘棉的时候，总在想怎样才能摘得更多。我想：一个人有两只手，可是我们摘棉是一只手为主，一下只能摘一朵花。我又想，我有两个眼睛和两条腿，为什么不能把它们充分利用起来呢？如果把眼睛、手、腿都使用得好，一下子就能摘完两个棉桃，那样，摘棉速度就可以加大了。我开始使用新的摘棉方法。我把全部精神都放在摘棉上，心里不胡思乱想。眼睛集中到花絮上，挑出熟花。双手齐下，光摘花不摘铃，免掉去壳耽误的时间。棉铃分五瓣的就用五个手指摘，每个指头按住一瓣花，再集中力量扯下来。棉铃分四瓣的就用四个手指摘。这样，我的摘棉效率就提高了，我得到了摘棉质量好、数量多的成绩。”
    现在这个先进的摘棉方法，已在全场推广。第一生产队已涌现出许多摘棉能手。张义法十时四十分摘棉二百九十五市斤。李根美十时二十分摘棉二百八十五市斤。第五生产队郭合荣三个小时摘棉六十市斤。到十月十五日，张顺又创造了更高的纪录。他在十时四十分内摘棉三百二十八市斤。
    现在各国营农场和农民正在收摘棉花，我们特别把屈应理的工作方法介绍出来，供大家学习、参考。
