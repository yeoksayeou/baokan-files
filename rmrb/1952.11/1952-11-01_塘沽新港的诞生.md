The birth of Tanggu New Port
On the coast of Bohai Bay in China, at the mouth of the Hai River, a large-scale man-made commercial port—Tanggu New Port—has been born! From now on, ten-thousand-ton freighters can enter the port with the tide, berth alongside the docks, and load and unload cargo. This is another great victory for the Chinese people in economic construction.

Tanggu New Port is backed by the resource-rich North China and Northwest provinces, only 45 kilometers away from Tianjin, the economic center of North China, with convenient railway and highway access. Coal, salt, and cotton from North China, as well as furs and local products from the Northwest, can be gathered in Tianjin by railways, highways, and rivers of all sizes, and then exported or shipped south via the new port. Imported goods can also be transshipped to various locations from here. Undoubtedly, Tanggu New Port will play an important role in future domestic and foreign trade.

In the past, the import and export trade of North China, mainly relied on Tianjin Port for maritime transport. However, Tianjin Port only communicates with the sea through a narrow Hai River. Ships over 3,000 tons cannot enter the port and must anchor on the sea surface more than 100 miles away, using barges to load and unload cargo. This not only increased transportation costs, but also made ships vulnerable to wind and waves, delaying schedules. After winter, the port would freeze, and many ships that should have berthed at Tianjin Port had to detour to Dalian and Guangzhou for loading and unloading. According to experts, the losses from loading and unloading with barges were equivalent to about 170 million catties of millet a year; the losses from detouring to Dalian and Guangzhou were even greater.

Building a large port in Bohai Bay was the ideal of the Chinese people and Mr. Sun Yat-sen. However, this ideal remained a paper plan in Sun Yat-sen's "National Reconstruction Program" during the decades of reactionary rule by the Kuomintang. Thirteen years ago, Japanese invaders began to build a port to plunder the resources of North China, but due to poor design and resistance from the construction workers, it only managed to allow 3,000-ton ships to barely enter the port after six years. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang reactionary government carried out "seizure and acceptance," stealing and destroying on a large scale, causing the waterway to be completely silted up. Not only could ships not enter the port, but even wooden boats and sampans could not dock. After the State Council of the Central People's Government issued a decision to build the port in August last year, the first phase of the construction project was completed two and a half months ahead of schedule in just 14 or 15 months, and the huge new port stood tall on the coast of Bohai, and the people of Tanggu heard the whistles of ten-thousand-ton freighters!

The construction of Tanggu New Port was a very large-scale project. The Bohai Bay has shallow water and abundant mud. The earthwork excavation alone was equivalent to digging a canal 35 meters wide and 4 meters deep from Tianjin to Beijing. During the construction process, more than 5,000 workers, engineering technicians, and administrative staff of the Tanggu New Port Engineering Bureau, under the correct leadership and with the help of Soviet experts, all displayed a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, and launched a patriotic port construction, labor-saving competition. From October of last year to the present, all employees have put forward a total of 1,949 rationalization proposals, of which 1,108 have been adopted, creating and saving 1.40418 billion yuan of wealth for the country. In the past, it took 1.5 minutes to stop a dredging ship to move its anchor. The crew of the Tanggu No. 5 dredging ship created a working method that allowed the anchor to be moved without stopping, which increased the dredging time of each Tanggu dredging ship by 200 hours per year, increased the dredging volume by 127,000 cubic meters, and saved 36,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity. The working time and mud discharge concentration of the dredgers have also been significantly improved due to improved working methods. In the breakwater project, the tugboat adopted the advanced experience of the Soviet "one-column towing method," increasing the number of platform boats towed from three to seven, improving the stone dumping capacity, and reducing the cost per cubic meter by 16,000 yuan. The Cui Shuqing slope masonry team created the "cyclic slope masonry method," which increased the slope masonry efficiency by 132 percent. In order to solve the shortage of divers, 66-year-old veteran diver Feng Tai put on an 18-jin diving helmet and a 130-jin diving suit, led the young workers to the seabed, and taught the apprentices hand-in-hand, resulting in a large number of divers.

### 塘沽新港的诞生

    塘沽新港的诞生
    在我国渤海湾的海滩上，在海河入海处，一个规模宏大的人工商港——塘沽新港诞生了！从现在起，万吨大轮船就可以乘潮入港，停泊靠岸，装卸货物。这是中国人民在经济建设上的又一次伟大胜利。
    塘沽新港背倚物产丰富的华北和西北各省，距华北经济中心天津仅四十五公里，有铁路、公路通达，交通非常方便。华北盛产的煤、盐、棉花，玻璃和西北盛产的皮毛、土特产等都可以由铁路、公路、大小河流汇集天津，再由新港出口或南运，进口的各种物资也可以由这里转运各地。无疑地，塘沽新港一定会在今后的国内外贸易中扮演重要的角色。
    过去华北的出入口贸易，海上运输主要依靠天津港。但是天津港只靠一条狭窄的海河沟通大海，三千吨以上的轮船不能入港，必须停泊在百多里外的海面上，用驳船来装卸货物。这样不只运费高，而且船只易受风浪袭击，延误船期。入冬以后，港口结冰，许多应该在天津港停泊的船只，就不得不绕道大连、广州装卸。据专家们计算，用驳船装卸的损失，一年约值一亿七千万斤小米；绕道大连、广州装卸，损失更大。
    在渤海湾兴建大港曾是我国人民和孙中山先生的理想。但是这一理想在国民党反动统治的几十年中始终是写在孙中山“建国方略”里面的纸上计划。十三年前，日寇为了掠夺华北的资源，开始建立港口，但是由于设计不周和建港工人的反抗，经过六年时间，却只能使三千吨轮船勉强入港。抗日战争胜利后，国民党反动政府进行“劫收”，大肆盗窃和破坏，致使航道全部淤塞，不但轮船不能入港，就连木船、舢板都不能靠岸。中央人民政府政务院在去年八月发布建港决定后，仅仅经过十四五个月的短短时间，第一期建港工程就提前两个半月完成，巨大的新港就屹立在渤海之滨，塘沽的人民就听到万吨巨轮汽笛的呼啸了！
    塘沽新港的建港工程是非常浩大的。渤海湾的海边水浅泥多，仅挖泥土方工程一项，就等于从天津到北京挖一条宽三十五公尺，深四公尺的运河工程。在工程进行中，塘沽新港工程局五千多工人、工程技术人员和行政管理人员，在正确的领导和苏联专家的帮助之下，都发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，开展了爱国建港劳动节约竞赛运动。从去年十月到现在为止，全体职工共提出合理化建议一千九百四十九件，被采纳一千一百零八件，给国家创造和节约了十四亿零四百一十八万元的财富。过去挖泥船移锚一次要停车一点五十分钟，塘沽五号挖泥船的船员，创造了移锚不停车的工作方法，使每只塘沽号挖泥船每年增加挖泥时间二百小时，增加挖泥量十二万七千立方公尺，节省电三万六千瓩时。挖泥船的工作时间和排泥浓度，也因改进了工作方法，有了显著提高。在防波堤工程中，拖轮采用了苏联“一列式拖带法”的先进经验，由拖三只增加到拖七只台船，提高了抛石能力，使每石方的成本降低了一万六千元。崔树清砌坡小组创造了“循环砌坡法”，使砌坡效率提高百分之一百三十二。为了解决潜水工人不够的困难，六十六岁的老潜水工人冯泰，戴起十八斤重的潜水帽，穿起一百三十多斤重的潜水衣，带领着青年工人沉到海底，手把手地教徒弟，结果教出了大批潜水工人。（新华社）
