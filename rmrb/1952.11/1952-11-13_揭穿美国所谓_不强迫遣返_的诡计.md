    Exposing the American Trick of So-Called "Non-Forcible Repatriation"
    In order to drive the many countries in the United Nations General Assembly to support its claim of forcibly retaining prisoners of war, the American imperialists, led by Acheson, are recently clamoring loudly, saying that prisoners of war must not be forcibly repatriated.
    Everyone knows that the Geneva Convention advocates the unconditional repatriation of prisoners of war and opposes the barbaric claim of forcibly detaining prisoners of war under the pretext of so-called "non-forcible repatriation." Everyone knows that the United States is using bayonets against prisoners of war, preventing them from returning home, but the United States insists that they cannot use bayonets to forcibly repatriate prisoners. This is just like a robber detaining other people's children, breaking up their families, and then pretending to protect those people's children. This is truly the most inhumane act in human history. Only imperialist warmongers can do this.
    On the snowy Korean front, according to American reporters, millions of young Americans are facing the desperate situation of "mass artillery, barbed wire, and minefields, cold moonlight, severe cold, and cruelty," and are turning to hope that the armistice negotiations can have results so that they can return home earlier to live a peaceful life. However, in order to detain the captured personnel of the Korean and Chinese side and break up the families of the Korean and Chinese people, the U.S. government is determined to have these young Americans die in the frozen caves of Korea. In the face of this extremely cruel, extremely inhumane, and extremely illegal action by the United States, where should the peace-loving countries of the United Nations go? Should they follow the United States to be enemies with the happiness of millions of young people and their families? Or should they stand on the position of the Geneva Convention and resolutely insist on returning the happiness of these young people who should have returned home long ago to live a peaceful life? This is a question that all politicians with a little sense of justice should answer immediately.
    All Chinese people resolutely oppose the so-called "non-forcible repatriation" of the United States, which aims to forcibly detain prisoners of war. We firmly believe that people of conscience all over the world will stand by our side and will never allow this cruel claim of the United States to be realized.

### 揭穿美国所谓“不强迫遣返”的诡计

    揭穿美国所谓“不强迫遣返”的诡计
    美帝国主义者为了驱使联合国大会中的许多国家来支持它的强迫扣留战俘主张，最近正在由艾奇逊带头，高声叫嚷，说什么战俘不得强迫遣返。
    人人都知道日内瓦公约主张无条件遣返战俘，反对借口所谓“不强迫遣返”而实际是强迫扣留战俘的蛮横主张。人人都知道是美国在用刺刀尖对着战俘，不许这些人回家，而美国却偏要说他们不能用刺刀尖来强迫遣返俘虏。这正如强盗扣留了人家的儿女，拆散了人家的家庭，还要装腔作势地说他是为了保护那些人家的儿女一样，这真是人类中最违反人道原则的行动。这是只有帝国主义好战分子才能做出来的。
    在白雪皑皑的朝鲜前线，按照美国记者的报道，千万美国青年正在面对着“成批的大炮、铁丝网及地雷阵，冰冷的月光、严寒、残酷”的绝望情景，转而希望停战谈判能有结果使他们更早一些回家去过和平生活。可是，美国政府为了扣留朝中方面的被俘人员，拆散朝中人民的家庭，却坚决要这些美国年青人在朝鲜的冰天雪窟之中送死。在美国这种极端残忍、极端违反人道又极端违法的行动面前，联合国爱好和平的国家究竟何去何从？是跟着美国来与千千万万青年人和他们的家庭的幸福为敌呢？还是站在日内瓦公约的立场上来坚决主张把这些青年人早应得到的回家过和平生活的幸福还给他们呢？这是一切稍有正义感的政治家们所应该立即予以解答的问题。
    全中国人民坚决反对美国旨在强迫扣留战俘的所谓“不强迫遣返”。我们坚决相信全世界有正义感的人民都会站在我们这一边，而绝不容许美国这一残酷主张来实现的。
