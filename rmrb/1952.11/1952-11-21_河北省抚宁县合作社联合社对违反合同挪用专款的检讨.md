Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    To the Editor: The criticism made by comrades Zheng Shufeng and Zhang Bingqian in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on September 24 regarding our cooperative's violation of contract and misappropriation of special funds is correct, and we sincerely accept it.
    In April of this year, our cooperative accepted the commission from the Qinhuangdao Branch of the Hebei Provincial Oil Company to purchase a batch of peanuts. In order to complete this task, our superior cooperative (Tangshan Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative) convened a joint meeting of various county cooperatives and relevant departments such as the Qinhuangdao Oil Company to study the specific steps and reporting procedures for the purchase work, and signed a purchase contract. According to the contract: After the contract task is completed and the accounts are settled, the Qinhuangdao Oil Company will give the cooperative a handling fee of 5 percent, and the special purchase funds should be used for the designated purpose. However, during the purchase process, due to the shortage of funds and difficulty in turnover in the grassroots cooperatives, we extracted 189.4 million yuan from the special purchase funds as handling fees for the grassroots cooperatives in order to accommodate them. We neither consulted the Special District Cooperative nor obtained the consent of the Qinhuangdao Oil Company beforehand, and we did not report to the Special District Cooperative or notify the Qinhuangdao Oil Company afterward. This is not only a violation of the contract but also a manifestation of a lack of organization and discipline. We have now settled all the money owed to the Qinhuangdao Oil Company and have learned a lesson from this, conducting an in-depth review of our work to ensure that similar incidents do not occur again.

### 河北省抚宁县合作社联合社对违反合同挪用专款的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    河北省抚宁县合作社联合社对违反合同挪用专款的检讨
    编辑同志：九月二十四日人民日报“读者来信”栏发表了郑树锋、张秉谦同志对我社违反合同挪用专款的批评，这个批评是正确的，我们诚恳接受。
    今年四月份，我社接受河北省油脂公司秦皇岛分公司的委托，代购一批花生米。为了完成这个工作，我们的上级社（唐山专区供销合作社）曾召开各县社及秦皇岛油脂公司等有关部门的联席会议，研究了收购工作的具体步骤及表报手续，同时签订了代购合同。按合同规定：俟合同任务完成，账目结清时，秦皇岛油脂公司给合作社手续费百分之五，代购专款专用，但在进行收购时，因各基层社资金短少，周转不开，为了照顾它们，我社就从收购专款中抽出一亿八千九百四十多万元，作为手续费拨给各基层社。事先既未向专区社请示并取得秦皇岛油脂公司的同意，事后也没有向专区社报告和通知秦皇岛油脂公司。这不仅是违反合同的行为，也是一种无组织、无纪律现象。我们现在已经结清了所欠秦皇岛油脂公司的全部款项，并接受这一教训，深入检查工作，保证以后不再有类似事件发生。  河北省抚宁县合作社联合社
