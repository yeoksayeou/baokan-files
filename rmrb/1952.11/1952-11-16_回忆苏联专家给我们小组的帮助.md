    Remembering the Help of Soviet Experts to Our Group
    Editor: I used to be a worker at the Lushun Shipyard's blacksmith shop. In order to further train me and make me a strong backbone of the motherland's economic construction, the Chinese Communist Party sent me to the Dalian Workers and Peasants' Rapid Middle School to study. Now, when I recall the help that Soviet experts gave to our blacksmith group, I deeply feel that the friendship the Soviet comrades gave us is incomparably great and profound. Our group, from the beginning of 1950 to the third quarter of this year, has already completed the production tasks for the first half of 1956. Our achievements are inseparable from the help of Comrade Kliuchnikov, the Soviet expert who was the workshop director. Our group was cultivated by him personally.

    In the past, we didn't pay attention to quality in our work. In the winter of 1949, our group was working on "chia rings". After finishing, we found a crack at one end of the "chia ring". I thought, "Let's just use it to make up the numbers," so I found a small hammer and knocked it, so that the crack was not visible on the surface. It happened that Comrade Kliuchnikov saw it. He was usually very gentle, but this time he was very strict, and he said to me with gestures: "This is irresponsible to the people." From then on, he checked our work every day; the workers in our group all said that the Soviet comrades came to China from afar and helped us responsibly, but we, who are building our own motherland, are so careless, it's really not right. From then on, we paid special attention to quality when working and cutting materials. If we found bad materials, we wouldn't use them, and we also came up with a way to test the first piece of work, and established an inspection system in the group. After three or four months, we eliminated rework and waste materials. Up to now, our group has always maintained 100% quality.

    Comrade Kliuchnikov taught us more than 150 advanced Soviet production operation methods. Every time, he always personally did a sample for us to see. Once, we were preparing to make small screws. According to the old method, it would take five or six days to complete the task. But he rolled up his sleeves and got to work, and finished them in one day. We were very excited and learned from him every day. He said: "We don't just work with our hands, we also have to let our brains work." He encouraged us to make rationalization proposals. Every time he assigned a task, he asked us how to do it, and asked us to think of better ways. If it was new work, he would first give the drawings to our group for discussion, so that we could consider it ourselves; sometimes, he would tell us about the advanced Soviet experience, or put forward the methods he thought of himself, to inspire us to think of better ways.

    Under his inspiration, we studied and improved our working methods all the time. Take the improvement of the large gear ring as an example. After several experiments, our output has gradually increased from one large gear ring per day to twenty-nine per day now.

    Comrade Kliuchnikov also helped us change our labor organization and improve work efficiency.

    Once, he saw nine of us crowded together to work, but in fact only one person needed to hold the tongs and one person to strike the hammer. He asked: "What are the other seven people doing? Wouldn't it be better to do other work?" We said: "What about when we do big jobs?" He said: "When you do big jobs, you can merge together! Labor is very precious, why waste it for nothing?" He kindly called me to the workshop office, took out a roll of drawings and said to me: "If I give you these jobs, how would you do them?" I said: "Do them one by one?" He said: "If you do it this way, you won't be able to finish it in two weeks. You should carefully calculate according to the size of the job, the melting capacity of the furnace, the efficiency of the large and small hammers, and the technical level of the group's workers, the firing time and the working time." Then he personally took a pencil and drew it for me to see: the first type is a big job, and the second type is a small job. Big jobs take an hour to fire, and small jobs can be fired in half an hour. The person who fires can come half an hour early to fire, and put the small job and the big job together in the furnace. Half an hour later, the small job is fired, and everyone comes to work, finishes the small job, and the big job is also fired. He pointed this out to me, and I was enlightened. From then on, our group's production plan became more and more detailed, with big jobs and small jobs overlapping, the furnace was never empty, people were never idle, and the steam hammer never stopped. What job, what person to do, how to place the tools, how to stand, everything was planned. There were no more collisions in production. This is the process of our creation of the assembly line specialized operation method and the overlapping and interweaving operation method.

    Comrade Kliuchnikov always told us to pay attention to labor protection and safe production. He criticized us when he saw us working without gloves. The year before last, Lao Yu in our group burned his foot. Comrade Kliuchnikov didn't say a word, and personally ran to the hospital. He helped the doctor carry the bag, wishing he could cure Lao Yu all at once. His high degree of internationalism touched everyone very much. The next day, he calmly told everyone about the accident. He said that accidents are not good for the workers themselves, and also affect production. The reason why Lao Yu's accident happened was that he usually didn't educate us enough. He also called me to the office and said that I, as the group leader, had not fulfilled my responsibilities. We firmly remembered that accident and Comrade Kliuchnikov's teachings, and there were no more personal accidents in the group.

    Comrade Kliuchnikov had already returned to the Soviet Union in Red May the year before last. Before leaving, he asked me to go to the workshop office and sincerely instructed us to consolidate our foundation on the existing basis and make greater achievements for the construction of New China. His concern for us shows the profound friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union.

### 回忆苏联专家给我们小组的帮助

    回忆苏联专家给我们小组的帮助
    编辑同志：我过去是旅顺船坞打铁厂的工人，中国共产党为了进一步培养我，使我成为祖国经济建设的坚强骨干，送我到大连工农速成中学学习。我现在回想起苏联专家对我们打铁小组的帮助，深深地感到苏联同志给予我们的友谊是无比的伟大与深厚。我们小组从一九五○年初起，到今年第三季度止，就已经完成了一九五六年上半年的生产任务。我们的成就，是和车间主任苏联专家克流其高夫同志对我们的帮助分不开的，我们小组是他亲手培养出来的。
    早先我们干活不讲究质量。一九四九年冬天，我们小组干“恰环”活。干完后，发现“恰环”的一端有裂纹。我想“凑数用吧”，于是找了把小锤来敲打，这就在表皮上看不出裂纹来。恰巧被克流其高夫同志看见了，他一向都是挺温和的，但这一次却非常严厉，连说带比画地对我说：“这是对人民不负责任的”。从那以后，他每天检查我们干活的情况；我们小组工友都说，苏联同志大老远到中国，认真负责地帮助我们，而我们建设自己祖国的人却那么稀松，实在不应该。从此，我们在干活时和切料时，都特别注意质量。发现坏的料就不要，还想出了试做头一个活的办法，并且在小组里建立了检查制度。经过了三、四个月，我们就消灭了反手活和废品料。一直到现在，我们小组始终保持着百分之百的质量。
    克流其高夫同志教给了我们苏联的先进生产操作方法一百五十多种，每一次他总是亲自先做一个样子给我们看。有一次，我们准备打小螺丝钉，按照过去的办法，需要五、六天才能完成任务。但是他卷起袖子干起来，一天就打成了。我们很兴奋，天天跟他学。他说：“我们不只是用两手干活，还得让脑袋也干活。”他鼓励我们提合理化建议，每一次布置任务时，都问我们怎么干，要我们想出更好的办法。如果是做新活，他就先把图纸交给我们小组讨论，让我们自己考虑；有时候，他把苏联先进经验告诉我们，或者把他自己想到的办法提出来，启发我们想出更好的办法。
    在他的启发下，我们时时刻刻地钻研，改进工作方法。拿改进大牙轮来说吧，经过几次试验，我们的产量已从每天做一个大牙轮，逐渐提高，现在已达到每天做二十九个。
    克流其高夫同志还帮助我们改变了劳动组织，提高工作效率。
    有一次，他看见我们九个人挤在一起干活，实际上只用一个人把钳一人打锤就行了。他就问：“还有那七个人干什么？不好去干别的活吗？”我们说：“干大活怎么办？”他说：“干大活时再合并起来干呀！劳动力是非常宝贵的，为什么要白白浪费呢？”他和蔼地叫我到车间办公室去，拿出一卷图纸对我说：“要是给你这些活，你怎么样干？”我说：“一样一样的干呗？”他说：“这样干法两个星期也干不完。你应该根据活的大小，焖炉的熔量、大锤、小锤的效率，小组工人技术的水平，烧火时间和打活的时间长短好生核计一下。”接着他就亲自拿着铅笔划给我看：第一种是大活、第二种是小活。大活要烧一个钟头、小活半个钟头就烧好了。烧火的人可以提前半个钟头来烧火，把小活跟大活一起放在焖炉里，半点钟以后，小活烧好了，大家正好来上班，干完小活，大活也就烧好了。他这样一指点，我可开了窍了。从此，我们小组的生产计划就越订越周密，大活、小活套着干，炉不空，人不闲，汽锤也不停，什么活什么人来干，工具怎样搁，人就怎样站，一切都有计划。在生产中乱碰头的事就没有了。这也就是我们创造的流水专一作业法，和重叠交差作业法的过程。
    克流其高夫同志时时刻刻告诉我们要注意劳动保护和安全生产。他看见我们干活不带手套就批评。前年，我们小组老于把脚烫坏了，克流其高夫同志一句话没说，亲自跑到医院去，他帮助大夫拿皮包，恨不得一下子给老于治好。他那种高度的国际主义精神使大家很感动。第二天他冷静地把这件事故给大家讲了一遍。他说出事故对工人自己不好，还影响生产。老于的事故所以发生，是他平常教育得不够。他又把我叫到办公室里，说我当组长的还没尽到责任。我们牢牢记住那次事故和克流其高夫同志的教导，小组里再也不出人身事故了。
    克流其高夫同志已经在前年红五月里回苏联去了。临走以前，他要我到车间办公室去，诚恳的嘱咐我们在现有的基础上再巩固一步，为新中国的建设做出更大的成绩来。他对我们的关怀，说明了中苏两国人民友谊的深厚。
