Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd: Shen Junru, member of the Preparatory Committee of the China Political Science and Law Society and Vice-President of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, sent a telegram to the President of the West German Federal Constitutional Court, sternly refuting the illegal actions of the West German Bonn puppet government. The Bonn puppet government, in order to facilitate the execution of the American plan to accelerate the restoration of German militarism and prepare for a new war, is conspiring to destroy democratic forces in West Germany by accusing the German Communist Party and thirty-seven democratic organizations of "violating the constitution" with seven fabricated "charges" such as "committing internal aggression," attempting to outlaw them.

The telegram stated: The West German government, following the will and dictation of American imperialism, is deliberately arming West Germany, undermining German unification, intensifying war preparations, and endangering world peace. This series of actions that violate the will of all the German people and peace-loving people around the world is most clearly manifested recently in the conclusion of the "General Treaty" and the "European Defense Community" agreement. These actions that endanger world peace and human security are resolutely opposed by all the German people and peace-loving people around the world.

The telegram then pointed out: In order to strive for peace and human security, the German Communist Party leads the German people in opposing the Bonn government's betrayal of the interests of the German people. This behavior is completely just and legal. The Bonn government's demand to ban the German Communist Party and thirty-seven democratic organizations is a reversal of right and wrong, extremely reactionary and despicable behavior. Facts have proven that it is not the German Communist Party and thirty-seven democratic organizations that are violating the constitution, but the West German Bonn government itself.

The telegram emphasized: The West German Federal Constitutional Court should sternly reject the West German government's request to ban the German Communist Party and thirty-seven democratic organizations.

    沈钧儒致电西德联邦宪法法院院长
    严斥波恩政府阴谋摧毁西德民主力量的罪行
    【新华社二十二日讯】西德波恩傀儡政府为便利执行美国的加速恢复德国军国主义和准备新战争的计划，阴谋摧毁西德民主力量，以所谓“实行内部侵略”等七条虚构“罪状”控诉德国共产党及三十七个民主组织“违反宪法”，企图加以取缔。中国政治法律学会筹备委员会委员、国际民主法律工作者协会副主席沈钧儒为此致电西德联邦宪法法院院长，对波恩傀儡政府这种非法行为，予以严正驳斥。
    电文说：西德政府仰承美帝国主义的意志与鼻息，蓄意武装西德、破坏德国统一、加紧备战、危害世界和平。这一连串违反全德人民和全世界爱好和平人民的意志的行为，最近更明显地表现在缔结
    “一般性条约”与“欧洲防务集团”协定上。这种危害世界和平与人类安全的行动，是全德国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民所坚决反对的。
    电文接着指出：为了争取和平与人类安全，德国共产党领导德国人民反对波恩政府出卖德国人民利益，这种行为，完全是正义的、合法的。波恩政府要求禁止德国共产党和三十七个民主组织，是颠倒是非的、极端反动与卑鄙的行为。事实证明，违反宪法的不是德国共产党和三十七个民主组织，而正是西德波恩政府本身。
    电文强调：西德联邦宪法法院对于西德政府请求禁止德国共产党和三十七个民主组织的申请，应该加以严正驳斥。
