    Sheng Baixian Achieves Bumper Harvest by Implementing "Close Planting of Small Rice Seedlings"

    Editor: Sheng Baixian, the head of the Heming Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhaiqi District, Tonglu County, Zhejiang Province, achieved a bumper harvest this year by adopting the advanced experience of "close planting of small rice seedlings."

    This spring, Sheng Baixian saw Chen Yongkang's advanced method of close planting of small seedlings in the newspaper and was initially skeptical. Later, after hearing a report on Chen Yongkang's high-yield experience at the county mutual aid group leader training class, his thinking was straightened out.

    Sheng Baixian decided to first promote this advanced farming method in the cooperative he led. After introducing this method to the cooperative members, some of them were skeptical, saying that this method would cause the rice to lodge. In response to these concerns, he further promoted the benefits of this method to the masses. Many people still thought this method would not work. Sheng Baixian, while promoting the method to the masses, also conducted practical experiments within the cooperative. The rice he planted this year using the "close planting of small seedlings" method has already yielded a bumper harvest. His one and one-third mu of high-yield land harvested an average of 1,003 jin of dry rice per mu, successfully realizing the "high-yield thousand-jin mu" plan. He proved with facts that adopting the "close planting of small seedlings" method can achieve good results.

    盛柏贤实行水稻“小株密植”获得丰收
    编辑同志：浙江桐庐县窄溪区鹤鸣乡农业生产合作社社长盛柏贤，今年采用水稻“小株密植”的先进经验，得到了丰收。
    今年春天，盛柏贤从报上看到陈永康的小株密植先进插秧法，开始也有些怀疑。他后来在县互助组长训练班听了关于陈永康丰产经验的报告，思想就搞通了。
    盛柏贤决定先在自己领导的合作社里推广这种先进耕作法。他把这一方法介绍给社员以后，有一部分社员怀疑这种方法，说这种方法会使稻子倒伏。他针对这些顾虑，进一步向群众宣传这种方法的好处。许多人还是认为这种办法行不得。盛柏贤一面向群众宣传，一面在社内实际试验。他今年采用
    “小株密植”法种的水稻，已获得丰收。他的一亩三分丰产田，平均每亩收割干稻谷一千零三斤，胜利实现了“丰产千斤亩”的计划。他用事实证明采用“小株密植”方法，能收到良好的成绩。
