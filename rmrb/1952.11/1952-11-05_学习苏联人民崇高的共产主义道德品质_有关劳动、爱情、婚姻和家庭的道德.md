    Learning the Noble Communist Moral Qualities of the Soviet People
    – Morality Concerning Labor, Love, Marriage, and Family –
    Deng Yingchao, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation

    With the victorious development of the great cause of socialist communism construction, a new spirit has been cultivated among the Soviet people – noble communist moral qualities. Whether in cities or villages, whether male or female, all Soviet citizens engaged in physical or mental labor possess a spirit of consciously and willingly contributing all their energy and wisdom to the construction and completion of the great cause of socialist communism, to creating a happier life for the millions of Soviet people, and to the enthusiastic labor for the cause of human security, happiness, and progress; this spirit has become the highest moral standard and supreme glory of the Soviet people.

    "My wish is: to work, and to merge my insignificant labor into the common labor of the builders of communism." This is a common aspiration of millions of Soviet male and female citizens, expressed in ordinary language by a common member of the Communist Youth League, Kosnov. This aspiration runs through all aspects of their work, study, and life, and it also runs through their attitude towards love, marriage, and family.

    Lenin taught everyone more than once: the relationship between the sexes and family issues are by no means personal private matters or trivial details of life, but matters of great social significance. The result of a man and a woman's love, marriage, and the formation of a family is naturally the birth of a third new life – a child, thus creating social content and responsibility for the child and the other party. Therefore, the Soviet people attach great importance to this issue, and regard educating young men and women to correctly handle love, marriage, and family issues as one of the basic tasks of the Soviet government, the Soviet Communist Party, the Communist Youth League, and all social organizations in their organization and education work. If someone is indifferent to these issues and calls it "not interfering in private life," they will be severely criticized. Therefore, those who handle these issues improperly should be earnestly educated from the perspective of ideological principles. Komsomolskaya Pravda once published a report titled "Breaking Off Relations," about a construction worker named Anatoly Shevkin, who resolutely broke off relations with his new acquaintance, Galina Chalova, a building material testing laboratory worker, because she despised him for being "an ordinary bricklayer" and not "a university student studying architecture," and despised the eaves he had painstakingly decorated. After the news was revealed, it attracted the attention of hundreds of thousands of young people, and more than three thousand people wrote letters to the editorial department of Komsomolskaya Pravda, ruthlessly exposing the capitalist remnants in the thinking of people like Galina Chalova. This public discussion played a significant educational role among Soviet youth. This incident reflects the new views of the Soviet people on labor, friendship, and love, and at the same time reflects how the Soviet people attach importance to the social significance of these issues and how earnestly they conduct communist moral education. The old and decadent view that talking about morality is not the duty of "politicians" or "poets" has no room for existence in the Soviet Union.

    Love and marriage in a socialist society are fundamentally different from those in feudal or capitalist societies. They are no longer considered from the perspective of economic interests, nor do they obey the orders of parents, and are not influenced by religious prejudice. It is not only based on sexual attraction, but also on the basis of complete equality between men and women and common participation in socialist communism labor, due to the consistent political and ideological views, that a sincere love develops. Sergei Guninko, an ordinary staff member of the Communist Youth League, accurately stated this idea: "Friendship between Soviet people cannot exist without participation in comrades' labor, without consistent common concerns, and without heartfelt joy"; therefore, sincere and pure love must be permeated with respect for the labor and occupation of the beloved, "For the Soviet people, creative labor is included in this magnificent concept. This labor constitutes his spiritual world, constitutes his inner beauty and his character." (The above two paragraphs are quoted from I. Kozhenko's "True Story")

    The sincere love in a socialist society is also an attitude of high responsibility for the fate of the lover and future children, a humane, profound, and lasting emotion, so "In socialist society, the persistence of love is a very precious moral quality of people." (Quoted from Korbanovsky: On Socialist Love, Marriage and Family) The great revolutionary teachers Marx and his wife Jenny; Lenin and his wife Krupskaya are good examples. In their common revolutionary cause, in their arduous and difficult lives, the flame of love soared, and they always respected and loved each other. In their families, between husband and wife, and between parents and children, there was never a shadow of disagreement or dislike until the last moment when they bid farewell to the world. Those who are fickle in their emotions and seek new love because their wife (or husband) is old or has a low status are considered morally depraved in the Soviet Union. Professor Korbanovsky strictly criticized this behavior, saying, "In this case, both men and women, due to selfish plans, did not think about the tragic fate that the destroyed family, the abandoned wife or husband, and the children who became half-orphans before their parents died would suffer. What does this behavior have in common with the principles of communist morality? Nothing." ("On Socialist Love, Marriage and Family" page 43)

    Undoubtedly, this sincere and lasting love is not "love at first sight," because a comprehensive understanding of each other and harmony of ideological views cannot be achieved in a short period of time. It must go through a considerable period of time to truly understand, to actually measure the feelings of both parties, to test the mutual help and encouragement of both parties in common labor, and to seriously consider future life and the responsibility for children. The poet Stepan Shchipachev vividly pointed this out with his beautiful verses:

    "Love must be cherished by both parties, with the passage of years.
    Love is not a sigh on a long bench, nor a walk in the moonlight.
    There is mud and snow – since you have to live together for a lifetime.
    Love is like a beautiful song, but a good song is not easy to compose."

    The result of the development of love naturally requires marriage and the formation of a family. The new family under the socialist system is established on the basis of the victory of socialist construction, the participation of the broad masses of women in socialist production, and the general establishment of public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, etc., to help women liberate themselves from trivial housework. The characteristic of this new family relationship is that couples marry completely freely on the basis of sincere love, and it is a monogamous system in which both men and women respect each other and are completely equal, and both parties are jointly responsible for the family's life.

    The interests of such a family are completely consistent with the interests of socialist society, so "The prosperous life of the Soviet family depends on the prosperity of the entire society and on the loyal and honest work of the family members for socialist enterprises and Soviet agencies." (Quoted from V. Svetlov's "On the New Family" page 19) Naturally, private possession of one's labor income and consumer property is not only not opposed in the Soviet Union, but is also explicitly protected by the Stalin Constitution, but this private possession exists under the control of socialist public property after the elimination of the private property system and the class exploitation system. Therefore, the family life situation is closely related to the development of socialist production and cultural undertakings. Now the Soviet families are living a prosperous, harmonious, and happy life with the outstanding achievements of socialist communism construction.

    The Soviet people are particularly concerned about the education of children. The Soviet government has carried out and is carrying out various concrete measures that are beneficial to the education of children (such as the widespread establishment of nurseries, kindergartens, children's parks, children's homes, children's hospitals, etc.), and will continue to expand them in the future; but parents must be jointly responsible with the state's children's organs for educating children to become active and conscious descendants of socialist communism construction. Parents must never shirk the responsibility of educating their children because the state is responsible. Because only in this way can healthy descendants be cultivated, can the growth of the national population be guaranteed, and can the strength of the country be strengthened. Therefore, the Soviet government pays great attention to helping and consolidating this socialist family life. In the noble communist moral concept of the Soviet people, not only is the mother's responsibility to the child emphasized, but the father is also taught to be equally responsible. In the new socialist family, parents have the same right to participate in social production labor, to live a common social and cultural life, and they also have the same responsibility to take care of and educate their children. They advocate that "Good production personnel, good Stakhanovite workers, and good social workers should coordinate their work in such a way that they have some time for cultural cultivation, handling family matters, and educating children." (V. Svetlov's "On the New Family" page 40) The June 26, 1936 editorial of Pravda more clearly stated, "A bad family member will not become a good Soviet citizen or a good social worker. An activist who suppresses women's rights among the people and treats his wife and children like pigs at home is not an activist, but a hypocrite." Therefore, the view that the Soviet people want to "eliminate the family" or "do not want the family" is completely inconsistent with the actual facts.

    In the Soviet Union, although such attention is paid to consolidating the socialist family, it does not mean that women should stay at home. On the contrary, Soviet women have completely equal rights with men to participate in various social work and social activities, and have the same status and treatment. The widespread and active participation of Soviet women in socialist communism construction and their significant contributions have become well-known facts. So how do Soviet women solve the contradiction between participating in social undertakings and consolidating the family? Let me cite the family of a scholar in millions of Soviet socialist families as an example! Lidia Ivanovna is a doctor who studies optics and has won the Order of the Red Star and the Order of the Red Banner of Labor. She has made outstanding achievements in academics. In her family, she loves her husband and works together, and raises eight children together, and has won the Order of "Motherhood Glory" and lives a fulfilling family life. Therefore, people often ask Lidia Ivanovna, "How do you coordinate your scientific work and the family affairs of educating eight children?" Her answer: When the children were young, they were sent to the nursery set up by the research institute (her work unit) during the day, and they were taken back after work. When the children grew up a little, they were sent to the kindergarten. The children's daily life, order, and diet are completely prescribed in accordance with the doctor's instructions, so they rarely get sick and throw tantrums. The children all obey the rules, treat each other equally, help each other, and each older child has a sense of responsibility for the younger children and assumes certain labor, sharing the responsibility of the parents. Did the children ever hinder her work? She affirmed, "Never hindered," "I dedicate all my free time to the children and rest with them. ... The joy of being with the children makes my spirit more cheerful, more full, makes my intelligence clearer, and enables me to work more effectively," "Mothers should not sacrifice themselves for the children and sacrifice their beloved careers. ... If the mother does more for society, then her position in the eyes of the children will be higher." (Quoted from "Soviet Women" No. 4, 1952) In this way, Lidia Ivanovna, like millions of Soviet women, under the guarantee of the socialist system, can not only actively participate in the construction of socialist communism and fully fulfill the responsibilities of Soviet citizens; but also can happily and satisfactorily fulfill the mother's responsibility for the education of her children.

    This socialist love, marriage, and family, although based on the victory of socialist revolution and construction, is not naturally grown. Because in the relationship between the sexes, family life, and in customs and habits, the remnants of feudal and capitalist forces remain more stubbornly than in other aspects; therefore, it is necessary to consciously take necessary steps to carry out long-term, extensive, and in-depth education to eliminate various non-proletarian moral concepts, and communist morality can shine brightly.

    Currently, our people are enthusiastically celebrating the 35th anniversary of the great Soviet socialist revolution. We must not only learn the advanced experience of Soviet socialist communism construction well, but also eliminate feudal and capitalist moral views, learn the noble communist moral qualities of the Soviet people, in order to establish new customs and new morality.

    学习苏联人民崇高的共产主义道德品质
    ——有关劳动、爱情、婚姻和家庭的道德——
    中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席  邓颖超
    随着社会主义共产主义伟大建设事业的胜利发展，苏联人民中已养成了一种新的精神——崇高的共产主义道德品质。不论在城市和乡村，不论是男的和女的，所有从事于体力劳动或脑力劳动的苏联公民，都具备着一种自觉自愿地贡献自己全部精力和智慧，为建设和完成社会主义共产主义伟大事业，为苏联千百万人民创造更幸福的生活，并为人类安全、幸福和进步事业而热情劳动的精神；这种精神成为苏联人民最高的道德标准和无上的光荣。
    “我的愿望是：工作，并把我自己微不足道的劳动，汇合到共产主义建设者的共同劳动里。”这是一位普通的青年团员柯丝诺夫，用平凡的语句说出了苏联千百万男女公民共同具备的爱国主义、集体主义的伟大愿望。这种愿望贯串在他们的工作、学习和生活的各个方面，同样也贯串在他们对待爱情、婚姻和家庭的态度中。
    列宁不止一次地教导大家：两性关系、家庭问题，绝对不是个人的私事或生活的小节，而是有重大社会意义的事情。男女双方恋爱、结婚和组织家庭的结果，很自然地要产生第三个新生命——孩子，从而就发生了社会内容，发生了对孩子和对另一方的责任。因此苏联人民是十分重视这问题，把教育青年男女正确处理恋爱、婚姻和家庭问题，当作苏联政府、苏联共产党、共产主义青年团、及一切社会团体在组织和教育工作中的基本任务之一。如果有人对这些问题漠不关心，而美其名为“不干涉私生活”，就要受到严格的批评。所以对于在这问题上处理不当的人，就要认真地提高到思想原则上来加以教育。共青真理报曾经用“绝交”的标题，报道了一位建筑工人安纳托里·谢甫金，因为他的新交——试验建筑材料的实验员加林娜·查洛娃鄙视他“是个普通的泥水工人”，不是“学建筑的大学生”，鄙视他辛勤劳动所修饰好的檐板，因而毅然与她绝交。这个消息披露以后，引起了成千上万的青年的注意，三千多人为此而写信给共青真理报编辑部，无情地揭露了加林娜·查洛娃之类的思想意识中的资本主义残余。这种公开的讨论，在苏联青年中起了重大的教育作用。这件事情反映了苏联人民对待劳动、友谊、爱情的新的观点，同时反映了苏联人民是如何重视这类问题的社会意义，如何认真地进行共产主义的道德教育。所谓谈道德不是“政治家”“诗人”……的本份，这种陈旧腐朽的观点，在苏联已经没有存在的余地了。
    爱情、婚姻，在社会主义社会里与在封建主义或资本主义社会里，有着根本的区别。它不再是从经济利益来考虑，也不要服从父母的命令，更不受宗教偏见的影响。它不仅基于性的吸引，而是在男女完全平等，共同参加社会主义共产主义劳动的基础上，由于政治、思想观点的一致，而发生发展的真挚的爱情。一位青年团的普通工作人员谢尔盖·古宁柯，确切地说出了这种思想：“不参加同志的劳动，没有一致的共同的关怀，缺乏衷心的喜悦，苏维埃人之间的友谊便决不存在的”；因此真挚而纯洁的爱情，一定渗有对心爱的人的劳动和职业的尊重，“对于苏维埃人来说，创造性的劳动，是列入壮丽的这个概念之中的，这种劳动构成他的精神世界，构成他内心的美丽和他的性格。”（以上两段均引自伊·柯仲科著“真实的故事”）
    社会主义社会的真挚的爱情，又是一种包含着对爱人的命运及将来的孩子的高度负责的态度，是一种人道主义的、深刻、持久的感情，所以“在社会主义社会里，爱情的持久，是人的极宝贵的道德品质”。（引自柯尔巴诺夫斯基：论社会主义的爱情、婚姻与家庭）伟大的革命导师马克思和他的妻子燕妮；列宁和他的妻子克鲁晋斯卡娅就是很好的榜样，他们在共同的革命事业中，在艰苦多难的全部生活中，爱情的火焰熊熊上升，始终互相尊敬，互相爱慕，在他们的家庭里、夫妇之间、父母子女之间从来不曾发生分歧和嫌弃的阴影，直到他们与人世告别的最后一刹那。在感情上的喜新厌旧，因为妻子（或丈夫）年老或地位不高而另找新欢的人，在苏联被认为是道德堕落的人。柯尔巴诺夫斯基教授严格地批评这种行为说“在这种情形之下，不论男女那一方都由于自私的打算，而没有想到被破坏了的家庭，被遗弃了的妻子或丈夫，以及在父母未死而成了半孤儿的孩子们，将要遭到怎样惨痛的命运。这种行为跟共产主义道德的原则，又有什么共通之处呢？什么也没有”。（“论社会主义的爱情、婚姻与家庭”第四十三页）
    无疑的，这种真挚的持久的爱情，不是“一见倾心”，因为相互的全面的了解，思想观点的协和，不是短时期中能达到的，必须经过相当的时期才能真正了解、才能实际的衡量双方的感情，才能考验双方在共同劳动中的互相帮助和鼓舞，才能认真考虑未来的生活和对儿女的责任。诗人史杰潘·施企巴乔夫用他美丽的诗句，生动地指出了这一点：
    “爱情必须双方珍惜，随着年代岁月。
    恋爱不是长板凳上的叹息，也不是月下花前的散步。
    有泥泞，也有雨雪—既然得一辈子共同生活。
    恋爱仿佛一首美好的歌，可是好歌却不容易谱写成功的。”
    爱情发展的结果，自然要求结婚，要求组织家庭。社会主义制度下的新家庭，是在社会主义建设胜利、广大妇女参加社会主义生产、并以普遍设立公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等等来帮助妇女从琐屑的家务下解放出来的条件下建立起来的。这种新家庭关系的特点，是夫妇在真挚的爱情基础上完全自由结婚的，是男女双方相互尊重，完全平等的一夫一妻制度，双方共同负责家庭的生活。
    这种家庭的利益与社会主义社会的利益是完全一致的，所以“苏联家庭的富裕生活，有赖于整个社会的富裕，有赖于家庭的成员对于社会主义企业和苏维埃机关的忠心诚实的工作”。（引自V·斯维特洛夫著“新家庭论”十九页）自然，私人占有自己的劳动收入和消费财产，在苏联不但不加以反对，而且斯大林宪法明文加以保护，但是这种私人占有，是在消灭了私有财产制度、阶级剥削制度以后，在社会主义公有财产支配之下存在的。因此家庭生活情况，与社会主义生产和文化事业的发展有着密切的关联。现在苏联的家庭正随着社会主义共产主义建设的卓越成就，而过着富裕、和睦、幸福的生活。
    对于儿童的教养，苏联人民是特别关切的。苏联政府过去和现在，已经进行了各种各样有益于教养儿童的具体措施（如普设托儿所、幼儿园、儿童公园、儿童之家、儿童医院等等），今后还要继续扩展；但是教育儿童成为积极自觉地建设社会主义共产主义的后代，父母必须和国家的儿童机关共同负责，决不能因为有国家负责而父母就卸却教养子女的责任。因为只有这样才能教养出身心健全的后代，才能保证国家人口的增长，才能加强国家的力量。所以苏联政府是很注意帮助和巩固这种社会主义的家庭生活。在苏联人民的高贵的共产主义道德观念中，不仅强调母亲对孩子的责任，而且还着重地教育父亲同样要负责任。在社会主义的新家庭里，做父母的，既同样有权参加社会生产劳动，共同过社会的文化的生活，也同样有责任来照顾孩子教育孩子。他们提倡“好的生产人员，好的斯塔哈诺夫运动者，好的社会工作人员，应该这样来配合自己的工作，他要有一部分时间来作文化修养，处理家庭、教育孩子。”（V·斯维特洛夫著“新家庭论”第四十页）一九三六年六月二十六日真理报的社论更明确地说“一个不好的家庭成员，同样不会做成好的苏维埃公民、好的社会工作者，在人群中格杀女权，在家庭里猪奴样对待自己的妻子和小孩的积极分子，算不得是积极分子，不过是伪善人，伪君子。”所以那种认为苏联人民要“消灭家庭”“不要家庭”的说法，完全与实际事实不相符合。
    在苏联，虽然是这样的注意巩固社会主义的家庭，但是并不等于说要妇女留在家庭里。相反的，苏联妇女和男子完全有同样的平等的权利参加各种社会工作社会活动，并有同样的地位和待遇。广大苏联妇女热情积极地参加社会主义共产主义建设，并作了重大的贡献，这一切已成为众所周知的事实了。那么苏联妇女如何解决参加社会事业及巩固家庭的矛盾呢？让我在这里引用苏联千百万社会主义家庭中一个学者的家庭来作例证吧！丽吉娅·伊万诺芙娜是一位研究光学并获得红星勋章和劳动红旗勋章的博士，在学术上有着卓越的成就，在家庭里和丈夫相亲相爱，一块工作，共同抚养了八个子女，获得了“母亲光荣”的勋章，过着圆满的家庭生活。因此，经常有人问丽吉娅·伊万诺芙娜，“您是怎样把自己的科学工作和教养八个孩子的家庭事务配合起来的呢？”她的回答：当孩子还小的时候，白天就送他们到研究所（她的工作机关）设立的托儿所去，工作完毕就领他们回来，当孩子稍微长大后，就送进幼儿园。孩子们的日常生活、秩序及饮食，完全依照医生的嘱咐来规定，因此很少生病和闹脾气。孩子们大家服从规约，平等相待，互相帮助，每一个稍大的孩子，对小孩子都有一种责任心，并担负一定的劳动，分担父母的责任。孩子们有没有妨碍过她的工作呢？她肯定地说“没有妨碍过”“我把自己所有的空闲时间都贡献给孩子们了，和他们一起休息。……与孩子们共处的乐趣使我的精神更爽快，更饱满，使我的智力更清醒，使我能更有成效的工作”“母亲不应当为了孩子们而牺牲自己，牺牲自己喜爱的事业。……如果母亲为社会作的事情越多，那她在孩子们眼中的地位也就越高。”（引自“苏联妇女”一九五二年第四号）就这样，丽吉娅·伊万诺芙娜和苏联千百万妇女一样，在社会主义制度的保障下，不仅能积极参加社会主义共产主义的建设事业，充分地履行苏联公民的责任；而且能愉快地圆满地完成母亲对子女的教养责任。
    这种社会主义的爱情、婚姻和家庭，虽然在社会主义革命和建设胜利的基础上，也不是自然生长起来的。因为在两性关系、家庭生活和在风俗习惯方面，封建的资本主义的残余势力，比在其他各方面更顽固地残存着；所以必须有意识地采取必要步骤，长期进行广泛深入的教育，清除各种非无产阶级的道德观念，共产主义道德才能光辉地生长起来。
    当前，我国人民正在热烈庆祝苏联伟大社会主义革命三十五周年，我们不仅要很好地学习苏联社会主义共产主义建设的先进经验，同样要清除封建的资本主义的道德观点，学习苏联人民高贵的共产主义道德品质，以树立新的风气和新的道德。
