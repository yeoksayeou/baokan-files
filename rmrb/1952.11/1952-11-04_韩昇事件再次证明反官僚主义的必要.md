Political Work Short Commentary:

    The case of the counter-revolutionary landlord Zhang Changzhi and others from Zhangmazi Village, Pingyuan County, Shandong Province, framing the peasant activist Han Sheng, though repeatedly instructed by the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council to be handled swiftly by the Shandong Provincial People's Government and the Pingyuan County People's Government, was still delayed for one year and three months before finally being correctly resolved. In order to appeal his years of grievance, Han Sheng went to the Government Administration Council four times, the Dezhou Branch of the Shandong Provincial People's Court three times, and the Pingyuan County People's Government more than ten times, traveling nearly ten thousand li back and forth. This incident once again illustrates that pernicious bureaucracy and a corrupt yamen style of work still seriously exist in some state organs. If effective measures are not taken to eliminate them, the interests of the people will be severely harmed, and the Party and the People's Government will become divorced from the masses.

    The biggest characteristic of bureaucrats is their lack of feeling for the people and their indifference to the interests of the people; they even turn a blind eye to major political events such as landlords' counterattacks and oppression of peasants. Wang Lixiang, the former county head of Pingyuan County People's Government, and Liu Qingyun, the deputy director of the county people's court, were typical examples of such individuals. During his tenure as county head, Wang Lixiang never paid attention to this major case. He neither studied the instructions of the Government Administration Council nor studied the nature of the case. Ren Shanjun, director of the County People's Supervision Committee, reported and asked him for instructions several times, but he paid no attention to it. Liu Qingyun, deputy director of the County People's Court, and Wang Guanmin, a staff member of the court, not only did not investigate or study the case in the trial work, but also were unwilling to listen to the plaintiff's appeals. They could determine that the plaintiff was not a good person based on rumors; they could also draft or revise judgments based on their own subjective imaginations and some one-sided materials. They even dared to arbitrarily suppress one side's speech in court; the accuser went to them repeatedly, but they could avoid meeting them, even preventing them from entering the house. Yang Gongtian, deputy director of the Dezhou Branch of the Shandong Provincial People's Court, and staff members Xu Yaoting, Wu Yutong, and others also treated the case with the same bureaucratic attitude.

    Another reason why the Han Sheng case could not be resolved for a long time was the existence of a corrupt red tape style of work in the higher-level organs. For example, when the Shandong Provincial People's Court received the first judgment on the case from Pingyuan County, it did not compare it with other materials of the case for research, and failed to discover the errors of the Pingyuan County People's Court in time, which further delayed the resolution of the incident. These facts once again fully demonstrate that our judicial organs must undergo a thorough reform. Without this, the People's Courts cannot truly fulfill their sacred duties of suppressing reactionaries and protecting the people.

    At present, the national judicial reform movement is developing in depth to the county level, and some places are also carrying out struggles against bureaucracy. The Shandong Provincial People's Government has seized this typical case of Han Sheng, and has specially convened meetings to analyze and sum up lessons, in order to promote the anti-bureaucracy struggle in the province. This practice is entirely correct. After the great movements such as the land reform in our country, especially the "Three-Anti" movement, the consciousness of the people has been significantly improved. If there are still people who dare to adhere to the corrupt bureaucratic style and the old yamen style without resolutely correcting them, they must be subject to the punishment they deserve.

### 韩昇事件再次证明反官僚主义的必要

    韩昇事件再次证明反官僚主义的必要
    山东省平原县张麻子村反动地主张长治等陷害农民积极分子韩昇的案件，虽经中央人民政府政务院一再指示山东省人民政府和平原县人民政府迅速办理，仍然拖延了一年零三个月，才最后得到正确的处理。韩昇为了申雪多年的冤屈，曾经四次到政务院，三次去山东省人民法院德州分院，十余次到平原县人民政府，往返行程近万里。这一事件再次说明，恶劣的官僚主义和腐朽的衙门作风仍然在一部分国家机关中严重存在着。如不采取有效办法予以肃清，人民的利益就会受到严重损害，党和人民政府就会脱离人民群众。
    官僚主义分子的最大特点，是对人民缺乏感情，对人民的利益漠不关心；甚至对地主反攻、欺压农民这样重大的政治事件，也睁着眼睛不看。前平原县人民政府县长王力翔和县人民法院副院长刘庆云，就是这样的典型人物。王力翔在任职县长期间，始终对这一重大案件不予重视。既不研究政务院的指示，也不研究案件的性质，县人民监察委员会主任任善俊几次向他汇报请示，他都毫不注意。县人民法院副院长刘庆云和该院工作员王冠民，在审判工作中不但不调查，不研究，而且连原告的呼声也不愿倾听。他们可以根据传闻所得，就断定原告不是好人；也可以根据自己的主观想像和一些片面的材料，就起草或修改判决书。他们还敢于在法庭上任意压制一方面的发言；控诉人三番五次去找，也可以避而不见，甚至不让进屋。而山东省人民法院德州分院副院长杨公田和工作人员许耀亭、吴玉同等，也用同样的官僚主义态度对待这一案件。
    韩昇案件所以迟迟不能解决的另一原因，是上级机关存在着腐朽的文牍主义作风。如山东省人民法院在接到平原县第一次对该案的判决书时，没有把它和该案的其他材料对照研究，未能及时发现平原县人民法院的错误，这就更加拖延了事件的解决。这些事实，再一次充分说明我们的司法机关必须进行一次彻底的改革。不这样，便不能使人民法院真正尽到镇压反动、保护人民的神圣职责。
    目前全国的司法改革运动正向县一级深入发展，有些地方也在进行反官僚主义的斗争。山东省人民政府抓住韩昇案件这一典型，专门召开会议、分析和总结教训，以推动全省的反官僚主义斗争，这一作法是完全正确的。我们的国家经过土地改革等伟大运动，尤其是“三反”运动，人民群众的觉悟已显著提高，如果还有人敢于坚持腐朽的官僚主义作风和旧衙门作风，而不坚决改正，他们就必须受到应得的惩罚。
