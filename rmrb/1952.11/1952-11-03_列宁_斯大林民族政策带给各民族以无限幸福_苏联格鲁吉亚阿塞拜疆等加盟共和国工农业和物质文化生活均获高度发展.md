(Xinhua News Agency dispatch of the 1st) On the eve of the great 35th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, the Chairmen, Vice-Chairmen, or Chairmen of the Council of Ministers of the Supreme Soviets of the Soviet Union's Georgian, Azerbaijani, Moldavian, Latvian, Kyrgyz, Tajik, Estonian, and Karelo-Finnish Republics spoke to TASS reporters, explaining the benefits of the Lenin and Stalin nationalities policy. They said that before the October Revolution, the peoples in these regions lived dark and painful lives under the enslavement of Tsarist ruling groups or imperialist powers. They had little or no industry, their agriculture was scattered and backward, and their material and cultural living standards were extremely low. But the October Revolution brought them happiness. Under the Lenin-Stalin nationalities policy that advocated equality and friendship among all nationalities, the great Russian nation helped them establish Soviet power, and they were closely united around the advanced Russian nation, and fundamental changes took place. They are now advanced, modern, and socialist nations.

Their countries have been industrialized. In Georgia, hundreds of enterprises in machine manufacturing, textiles, food, oil extraction and refining, mining, electricity, and many other industries that did not exist in the past have been established. In 1949, the output of large-scale industry was 37 times that of 1913. The output of Azerbaijan's main industrial sector, the petroleum industry, was already three and a half times that of 1913 in 1940. The food industry is one of the key sectors of Moldavian industry. Last year, its canned food production alone was half again as much as the total canned food production of all of Tsarist Russia's canned food industry in 1913. Latvia is now able to manufacture very complex machines and precision instruments, which shows that its industry has reached a high level of technology. In Kyrgyzstan, there are more than 5,000 enterprises in mining, petroleum, light industry, food industry, and other industries. After World War II, the new industries of manufacturing machine tools and other machinery have greatly developed. The output of large-scale industry has increased 360 times. In Tajikistan, a major cotton-producing area, the Stalinabad cotton gin alone currently processes 50 times the total amount of cotton processed by all cotton gins in Tajikistan before. Its machine-building factory is constantly manufacturing various equipment for textile mills, silk mills, tobacco factories, and cotton gins. Estonia, famous for its oil shale, now has its oil shale mining industry almost completely mechanized, and the complex equipment used in this industry is also manufactured by itself. In Karelia-Finland, where the timber industry is the main sector of the national economy, the era of axes and crosscut saws is gone forever. Logging, transportation, and loading have been basically mechanized, and thousands upon thousands of electric saws, skidding tractors, logging trucks, and other machines are working in the forests.

The agriculture of these nationalities has been collectivized. Georgia has become the main center for planting subtropical plants in the Soviet Union. There are thousands of tractors and tens of thousands of other agricultural machines operating in the fields of Azerbaijan's collective farms. The mechanization of laborious work such as cotton planting has reached over 90 percent. The cotton harvest has more than tripled compared to before the revolution. In Moldavia, plowing and sowing are now almost entirely done without manual labor, and 70 percent of all field work has been mechanized. Latvia's grain production has doubled in the years of collectivization. Compared with before the revolution, Kyrgyzstan's cotton production has almost tripled, and grain production has increased by almost 86 percent. Kyrgyzstan has become the main producer of industrial crops such as sugar beets, medicinal poppies, and major oil crops. Its agriculture is based on powerful machinery and advanced farming methods. Most of the agricultural work in Tajikistan is done by tractors, combines, and other complex machinery. This year, the average cotton yield per mu (Chinese unit of measurement, 1 mu ≈ 0.16 acres) has reached more than 330 jin (Chinese unit of measurement, 1 jin ≈ 0.5 kg). Its grain harvest is almost twice that of Egypt or four times that of Iran. Compared to only 1950, the number of tractors working in the fields of Estonian collective farms and state farms has doubled. Not long ago, Karelian farmers still used plows and harrows to cultivate small plots of land, yielding only 60 jin or so of naked barley per mu. Now, this republic has more than 30 machine tractor stations, and advanced collective farmers can harvest 300-400 jin of wheat per mu.

On the basis of the high development of industry and agriculture, the material and cultural life of all nationalities has been fundamentally changed, and their lives are full of confidence in greater happiness and an atmosphere of prosperity. Culture with national form and socialist content has been greatly developed. The phenomenon of widespread illiteracy in the past has been eliminated, seven-year or ten-year education has been universally implemented, and hundreds and hundreds of scientific research institutions, higher and secondary education institutions have been established, training a large number of scientists and specialized personnel for construction. Just looking at one example can show how much their culture has developed. Tajikistan has only a fraction of the population of its neighboring country Afghanistan, but its existing urban and rural primary schools, seven-year schools, and ten-year schools are equivalent to ten times that of its neighboring country Afghanistan. Fifty-eight out of every 10,000 people in Tajikistan are studying in universities, while in France, there are only 36.

The directives of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the new Five-Year Plan have opened up even broader prospects for the economic and cultural development of these nationalities. They have full determination and confidence to complete this glorious task and move towards communism.

    列宁—斯大林民族政策带给各民族以无限幸福
    苏联格鲁吉亚阿塞拜疆等加盟共和国工农业和物质文化生活均获高度发展
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社消息：在此伟大的十月社会主义革命三十五周年纪念的前夕，苏联的格鲁吉亚、阿塞拜疆、摩尔达维亚、拉脱维亚、吉尔吉斯、塔吉克、爱沙尼亚、卡累利阿—芬兰等加盟共和国的最高苏维埃主席团主席、副主席或部长会议主席纷纷对塔斯社记者发表谈话，说明列宁和斯大林的民族政策的好处。他们说：在十月革命前，这些地方的民族在沙皇统治集团或帝国主义强国的奴役下，过着黑暗痛苦的日子。他们的工业或者很少或者根本没有，他们的农业分散落后，他们的物质和文化生活水平极低。但是十月革命给他们带来了幸福。在主张各民族平等友好的列宁—斯大林民族政策之下，伟大的俄罗斯民族帮助他们建立了苏维埃政权，他们紧密地团结在先进的俄罗斯民族周围，根本的变化发生了。他们现在已是先进的现代的社会主义的民族了。
    他们的国家已经工业化。在格鲁吉亚，数百个过去所没有的机器制造、纺织、食品、采油与炼油、采矿、电力及许多其他工业的企业已经建立起来了，一九四九年大规模工业的产量相当于一九一三年的三十七倍。阿塞拜疆的主要工业部门石油工业的产量，早在一九四○年就已为一九一三年的三倍半。食品工业是摩尔达维亚工业关键部门之一，去年单只它的罐头食品产量就比沙俄一九一三年全部罐头食品工业的全部产量还多半倍。拉脱维亚已能制造非常复杂的机器和精确的仪器，这说明它的工业已达到高度技术水平。在吉尔吉斯，开矿、石油、轻工业、食品工业及其他工业已有五千多个企业，在第二次世界大战之后，制造工作母机及其他机器的新工业大大发展起来。大规模的工业产量已增加到三百六十倍。在塔吉克这个产棉要地，单只斯大林纳巴德轧棉厂目前加工处理的棉花，就等于以前塔吉克所有轧棉厂的总和五十倍之多。它的机器制造厂不断为纺织厂、丝织厂、烟草厂、轧棉厂制造各种装备。爱沙尼亚的这个页岩名产地，现在它的页岩开采工业几乎已完全机械化，而且这种工业所用的复杂装备也都是自己制造的。在卡累利阿—芬兰这个以伐木业为国民经济主要部门的国度，用斧头和横锯的时代已经一去不复返了。伐木、拖运和装载等工作基本上已经机械化了，成千成千的电锯、滑行拖拉机、拖木用卡车及其他机器在森林里工作着。
    这些民族的农业已经集体化了。格鲁吉亚已成为苏联种植亚热带植物的主要中心。阿塞拜疆的集体农庄的田野上有几千部拖拉机和几万部其他农业机器开动着。像种植棉花这种费力的工作，已达到百分之九十以上的机械化。棉花的收获量已为革命前的三倍多。在摩尔达维亚，耕地和播种工作已经几乎完全不用人力，全部田野工作已有百分之七十机械化。拉脱维亚的谷物产量在集体化的几年中已经增加了一倍。和革命前比较起来，吉尔吉斯的棉花产量差不多增加到了三倍，谷物产量差不多增加了百分之八十六。吉尔吉斯已成为糖萝卜、药用罂粟、主要产油作物等工业作物的主要生产地。它的农业是以效力强大的机械和先进的耕作方法为基础的。塔吉克的大部分农业工作都是由拖拉机、联合机和其他复杂的机器来操作。今年棉花每亩产量平均高达三百三十多斤。它的谷物收获量差不多相当埃及的两倍或伊朗的四倍。仅与一九五○年比较，现在爱沙尼亚集体农庄和国家农场田野上工作的拖拉机数就增加了一倍。不久以前，卡累利阿农民还是用犁耙来耕种小块土地。每亩只产六十多斤裸麦。现在这个共和国已有三十多个机器拖拉机站，先进的集体农民每亩可收三、四百斤小麦。
    在工农业高度发展的基础上，各民族的物质和文化生活已经根本改观，他们的生活充满着对更大的幸福的信心和欣欣向荣的气氛。民族形式和社会主义内容的文化得到了长足的发展。往日普遍文盲的现象已经扫除，七年制或十年制教育已经普遍实施，成十成百的科学研究机关、高等和中等教育机关已经设立起来，为建设事业培养大批科学家和专门人材。只要看一个例子就可以知道他们的文化已发展到怎样的程度。塔吉克的人口只有邻国阿富汗的几分之一，可是它的城市和乡村现有的初等学校、七年制学校和十年制学校却相当于邻国阿富汗的十倍。塔吉克每一万人中有五十八人在高等学校中学习，而在法国，却只有三十六人。
    联共中央关于新五年计划的指示又给这些民族的经济和文化的发展开辟了更广阔的前途。他们有充分的决心和信心完成这个光荣的任务，向共产主义迈进。
