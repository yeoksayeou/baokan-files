The play "Dawn Over Moscow," written by Soviet author Anatoly Surov, began its performance in Beijing on the 26th of this month by the Northeast People's Art Theater. This work vividly depicts the new social contradictions and ideological struggles in Soviet society, proving that the dawn of communism has already shone upon the land of the Soviet Union.

Since June 12th of this year, the Northeast People's Art Theater has performed this play in Shenyang, Dalian, Anshan, Harbin, and other places in the Northeast, totaling nearly two hundred performances. Hundreds of thousands of viewers have received excellent communist education, promoting the industrial construction of the Northeast. Party, Communist Youth League, trade union, and administrative cadres from various regions have traveled by train to see the play. The play was once divided into two performance groups, but still could not meet the actual demand. Railway cultural troupes from Jilin, Qiqihar, Andong, Dalian, and other places have successively observed the performances of the Northeast Art Theater, received their guidance, and then rehearsed the play themselves. Art units from Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, and Beijing have contacted the Northeast People's Art Theater and are also preparing for performances. It is possible that this play will be performed nationwide early next year.

The performance of this play has played a great role in promoting production on the Northeast production front. For example, the Shenyang Woolen Mill's past products were dull in color and difficult to sell. After the Party Committee Secretary and the Factory Director of this factory saw the play, they mobilized the workers to improve the printing and dyeing methods, improving the quality of the products, and making the colors and patterns more beautiful. Therefore, department stores ordered a large number of their products. The female factory director of the Dalian Knitting Factory had conservative ideas and suppressed the workers' creative labor. Knowing that the factory's products were not popular with the masses, she still refused to allow the workers to improve the products. In the past she refused to admit her mistakes, until after seeing the play, her thinking changed and she automatically made a profound self-criticism to the workers. The performance of this play in Anshan also gave the workers, technicians, engineers, and factory directors of the steel plant great inspiration. They realized the great role of the creative labor of the working masses and the importance of the "liaison system," and more clearly recognized the bright future of socialist and communist society.

The performance of this play in the Northeast has established an unprecedentedly close friendship between the audience and the actors. Many viewers wrote to the theater troupe, offering opinions and condolences; the Communist Youth League members of schools went to the theater troupe to present flowers to the actor playing the Party Committee Secretary Kurepin, believing he played the role well. In the sweltering heat, many actors became ill from exhaustion and had to take a week off, and the masses wrote letters expressing concern for their health.

The rapid scene changes in this four-act, ten-scene play are unprecedented in the country. The fastest record is that the ten scene changes took less than two and a half minutes in total, because they used some suspended scenery. Because of the lack of technicians in the Northeast, most of the comrades in charge of scene changes were comrades from the theater who were engaged in song and dance. They used their creativity to improve the operating methods of scene changes.

This play has given the comrades in the Northeast literary and art circles great inspiration. They have gained a lot of experience in creative thinking, creative methods, and how to overcome the shortcomings of formulaic and conceptual approaches in creation. In particular, from the image of the Party Committee Secretary, they saw how to portray positive characters.

Since the play began performing in Beijing on the 26th, it has also been warmly welcomed by Beijing audiences. In less than three hours, group ticket registrations reached 18,000, equivalent to the total number of group tickets for twenty-five days of performances; audiences buying individual tickets lined up very early every day, waiting to buy tickets. Currently, the registered group ticket audiences are mostly cadres from government organizations, but also include some workers and staff from industrial and mining units. In order to accommodate more worker and peasant audiences to see the play, the Northeast People's Art Theater is considering another group ticket registration. Some viewers who have seen the play have written to the director and actors of the play, saying that they have received a vivid communist education after seeing the performance. On the eve of our country's large-scale construction, the play "Dawn Over Moscow" plays an inspiring and promoting role.

### “曙光照耀着莫斯科”的演出发挥了巨大教育作用

    “曙光照耀着莫斯科”的演出发挥了巨大教育作用
    苏联安讷托利·苏洛夫写的剧本“曙光照耀着莫斯科”自本月二十六日起由东北人民艺术剧院在北京开始演出。这个作品生动地表现了苏维埃社会中新的社会矛盾和思想斗争，证明了共产主义的曙光已经照耀在苏联的国土上了。
    东北人民艺术剧院自今年六月十二日起在东北沈阳、大连、鞍山、哈尔滨等地演出这个戏，一共演了近二百场，使几十万观众受到了很好的共产主义教育，推动了东北的工业建设。各地党、团、工会、行政干部纷纷坐了火车去看这个戏。这个戏曾一度分为两班演出，仍不能适应实际要求。吉林、齐齐哈尔、安东、大连等地铁路文工团曾先后观摩东北艺术剧院的演出，接受他们的辅导，回去后也都排演了这个戏。广州、杭州、上海、汉口、天津和北京方面的艺术单位曾和东北人民艺术剧院联系，也在作演出准备。明年初这个戏可能在全国范围内演出。
    这个戏的演出在东北生产战线上发挥了很大的推动作用。例如沈阳毛织厂过去的出品颜色黯淡，货品卖不出去。这个厂的党委书记和厂长看了这个戏，才发动工人改进印染方法，提高了出品的质量，颜色和花纹都更美丽了。因此百货公司就向他们定了大批货色。大连针织厂女厂长有保守思想，压抑工人的劳动创造，明知厂中出品不受群众欢迎，仍不许工人改进产品。她过去不肯承认错误，直到看了这个戏后，思想转变了，自动向工人作了深刻的检讨。这个戏在鞍山的演出，也给炼钢厂的工人、技术人员、工程师和厂长很大启发。他们体会到工人群众的创造性劳动的伟大作用和“联系制度”的重要性，更明确地认识了社会主义、共产主义社会的美好前途。
    这个戏在东北的演出，使得观众和演员间建立了空前亲密的友谊。很多观众给剧团去信，提意见、致慰问；学校的青年团员们到剧团给扮演党委书记库列聘的演员献花，他们认为他演得好。在盛暑中，很多演员累病了，不得不休演一周，群众纷纷去信，表示关心他们的健康。
    这个四幕十场的戏换景之快是全国空前的，最快的纪录是十场换景时间一共不到两分半钟，原因是他们用了一些吊景。东北技工缺乏，换景的同志大多是剧院搞歌舞的同志，他们发挥了创造性，改进了换景的操作方法。
    这个戏给东北文艺界同志们很大的启发。在创作思想上，和创作方法上，在如何克服创作中公式化、概念化缺点的问题上，他们都有不少体会。尤其是从党委书记这个形象中，他们看到了怎样描写正面人物的方法。
    这个戏自从二十六日在北京演出以来，也受到北京观众的热烈欢迎。在不到三小时内，团体登记票就达一万八千张，相当于二十五天演出中的全部团体票数额；购买零票的观众每天很早就去排队，等着买票。目前已登记的团体票观众以机关干部为多，也有一部分工矿单位的职工。为了照顾更多的工农观众看戏，东北人民艺术剧院正在考虑再作一次团体票登记。看过戏的某些观众给该剧导演和演员去信，说看了这次演出，受到了生动的共产主义教育。在我国进行大规模建设的前夕，“曙光照耀着莫斯科”一剧起着鼓舞和推动的作用。
