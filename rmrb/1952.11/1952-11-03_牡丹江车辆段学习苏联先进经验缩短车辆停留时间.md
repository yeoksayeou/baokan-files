    Mudanjiang Vehicle Depot Learns from Soviet Advanced Experience to Shorten Vehicle Turnaround Time

    Editor: In the past, the Mudanjiang Vehicle Depot only inspected but did not repair trains during train maintenance work. When a fault was discovered, the train had to be detained in the depot, which prolonged the vehicle turnaround time and affected transportation. After the establishment of the China Changchun Railway, with the help of Soviet experts, the train maintenance work was reformed, and a system was established to emphasize the importance of combining inspection and repair, thereby shortening the vehicle turnaround time. During the full-load, over-axle, and 500-kilometer movement, we also promoted the Soviet "Shcheglovsky Train Repair Method." During the promotion, Comrade Burlas Miskis, Deputy Director of the Mudanjiang Vehicle Depot, with a high degree of internationalism, patiently told us that implementing the "Shcheglovsky Train Repair Method" can save vehicle turnaround time, ensure vehicle quality, and prevent accidents, and specifically helped us in our work.

    In the past, it took 25 minutes to inspect a train (without repair), but now it only takes 15 minutes to inspect and repair. Preliminary statistics from January to September this year show that a total of 29,272 car-hours were saved, and the quality was guaranteed, preventing 1,509 accidents.

    牡丹江车辆段学习苏联先进经验缩短车辆停留时间
    编辑同志：牡丹江车辆段在过去列车检修工作中，只检查，不修理，发现故障，就只好把列车扣留在段内，延长了车辆停留时间，影响运输。中长铁路成立以后，在苏联专家的帮助下，改革了列车检修工作，并订出制度，强调检查和修理相结合的重要性，因而缩短了车辆停留时间。在满载、超轴、五百公里运动中，我们又推行了苏联的“什车布里金列车检修法”。在推行中，牡丹江车辆段副段长布尔斜斯密斯基同志又以高度的国际主义精神，耐心地告诉我们实行“什车布里金列车检修法”，可以节省车辆停留时间，可以保证车辆质量，防止事故。并具体帮助我们工作。
    过去检查一列车（不修理），需要二十五分钟，现在又检查又修理，只要十五分钟。自今年一月至九月的初步统计，共节省了二万九千二百七十二车小时，并保证了质量，防止了一千五百零九件事故。
