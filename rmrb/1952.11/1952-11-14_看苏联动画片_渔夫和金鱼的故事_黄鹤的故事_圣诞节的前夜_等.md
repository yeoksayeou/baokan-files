    Soviet animated films are loved by children and adults alike. This is not only because it is an art form that excels at imagination and fantasy, but also because it is, without exception, a weapon on the ideological front. The colored animated films "Fedia Zaitsev" and "The Strange Box," etc., which were recently screened in Beijing, are artistic works that possess a high degree of ideological content and artistry.
    "Fedia Zaitsev" is a satirical and educational fairy tale film. It tells the story of Fedia Zaitsev, a child who violates public morality by drawing indiscriminately on the clean classroom walls, and who hides his mistake in front of the public out of cowardice. This behavior infuriates the little man he drew, infuriates the toys he loves, they all oppose him, making him unable to be quiet. These bizarre plots are a spiritual force of condemnation that fits the psychology and life of children, and promote Fedia's introspection. These plots are fictional, these images are fantasies, but they coincide with the uneasy psychological state of a child who has made a mistake and is denying it, so they do not feel absurd and grotesque, and children especially like them. Although this error occurred in Fedia, in terms of the relationship between the individual and the collective, and in terms of the attitude that should be taken towards errors, the educational target of this film is not limited to children.
    During the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," Beijing and dozens of other cities will screen several beautiful Soviet animated films at once, most of which are colored. The animated film of the same name based on Pushkin's famous poem "The Tale of the Fisherman and the Fish" is one of them. These animated films, taken from poems, novels, legends, and fairy tales, will further allow us to recognize the achievements of the young but outstanding Soviet animated film industry.
    These animated films, like the previously mentioned "Fedia Zaitsev," have become fascinating works of art by utilizing the strengths of painting, drama, and film. At the same time, because the artists follow the Party's principle of partisanship in literature and art of the great Lenin and Stalin, they have become weapons to educate the people and encourage them to move forward. For example, "The Story of the Yellow Crane," which is "a legend about an ancient China, during the period of greedy and cruel feudal bureaucrats 'rule,' about a wandering performer, Old Ma," clearly shows the people's indomitable fighting will, unyielding strength, and the wisdom revealed in the twists and turns of struggle. ...
    These positive themes do not depart from the charming and realistic images. For example, in "The Story of the Yellow Crane," the yellow crane painted by the wandering performer for the working people is plundered by the official, is neither raised nor feared by whips, and refuses to serve the official. The yellow crane, standing proudly in the mural, repeatedly returns to its original form under the official's angry smearing. Finally, hearing Old Ma's call, it calmly steps over the official's head and flies away, flapping its wings. These plots not only illustrate that the people's art cannot be occupied by reactionary rulers, but also that the yellow crane itself is a symbol of the people's will, strength, and wisdom. This kind of animated film, which obeys solemn political purposes, has a lyrical tone and a fighting nature. Precisely because it is not a descriptive symbol that merely has the outer appearance of things, precisely because it does not use abstract and unfeeling symbols to replace vivid artistic images, the theme of the work is expressed more clearly, and it is easier for viewers to accept the correct educational significance.
    When animation is mentioned, it is easy to think of general, exaggerated, deformed, and weakly realistic shapes. This is because we have come into contact with some of these shapes. However, the appealing and moving power of Soviet animated films does not rely on general deformation and exaggeration. Of course, since it is animation, deformation and exaggeration are permissible, but more importantly: the use of any painting technique must serve the purpose of creating a realistic image. Soviet animation artists follow the excellent tradition of realism, making the characters in these animations have a strong sense of reality. In this regard, it is not behind other styles of film. For example, the old fisherman in "The Tale of the Fisherman and the Fish" is painted, clearly showing the painter's watercolor and line drawing skills—simple and bright colors, deletion of unnecessary details in the shape, and exaggeration of necessary points. However, precisely because the painter grasped the most important thing—the old fisherman's character—the audience forgets that they are watching a painting, and think they are facing such an old fisherman. It is like this: relying on his own labor and not relying on accidental good fortune, simple, sincere, and kind, under the pressure of his greedy and insatiable old wife, he shows sorrow, complaint, and disgust. This shape of the old fisherman in the situation of having to obey his old wife is painted, and it is also alive. The so-called "alive" is of course not because he can move on the screen, but because it makes the audience forget that they are watching a painting, as if they are facing an old fisherman who lives and works in such an environment.
    This characteristic of realistic shapes is also manifested in other animated films. For example, in "The Night Before Christmas," adapted from Gogol's novel, there are all kinds of characters, that strong and happy girl, that powerful and brave blacksmith, that lustful and cowardly priest... In terms of shape, the characteristics of painting are obvious; however, they often make the audience not feel like they are watching a painting, as if they are facing these living people in old Russian villages. We can say without exaggeration that these animated films are high-level paintings, because they have captured the most important thing in the art of painting.
    The ability to create such realistic images is first and foremost due to the artists' serious study of the script. "The Tale of the Fisherman and the Fish" clearly shows that the artists are both faithful to the style of Pushkin's original work, and do not forget that animated films are first and foremost appealing to the visual sense of painting, not first and foremost to the auditory sense of poetry.
    We remember that Pushkin, in this poem, structurally emphasized preserving the style of folk songs. For example, the plot of the old woman repeatedly asking the old fisherman to make various requests to the goldfish, except that the requests are different, has many corresponding repetitions in the language structure and even in the wording. Precisely because of this, this poem not only has the characteristic of being simple and easy to understand, but also makes the content of each request stand out. The animated film not only maintains this lovely style in the structure and text description, but even in the composition and the choice of the main character's (old fisherman) posture and the arrangement of the camera angles, it strives not to damage the lovely style of the original poem. We see on the screen: the roughly the same direction and posture of the old fisherman's appearance each time he goes to the seaside can prove that the author's statement is not without basis. However, precisely because painting is not a translation and annotation of poetry, we can see the creation of shapes everywhere. This creation is not only manifested in the depiction of the changes in the shapes and colors of the characters and backgrounds caused by different plots, but also in the arrangement and depiction of certain details that are more conducive to a clear understanding of the content of the poem and that can give full play to the strengths of the shape. For example: in order to contrast and describe the broken wooden basin and the good wooden basin, the lizard that comes out of the broken mouth of the broken wooden basin, and the soap bubbles that emerge from the good wooden basin, are also special creations of shape that do not violate the spirit of the poem and are conducive to the development of the spirit of the poem. Precisely because of this, "The Tale of the Fisherman and the Fish" is both a "poem" and a "painting."
    Animation production is a complex and difficult task. In order to give full play to the characteristics of this special art form, it must go through very arduous labor. How to use the strengths of models is a necessary condition to ensure the reality and vividness of the image. Soviet animation artists have a good way of cooperating with actors in this regard. The old fisherman in "The Tale of the Fisherman and the Fish" was modeled by the actor B. Tsirkov. Precisely because the shape of the character is not fabricated out of thin air but relies on the help of cultivated actors, the image of the old fisherman can be created so vividly and realistically. Excellent actors can delve into the inner world of the character, fully understand the psychology and emotions of the specific character in a specific environment, so as to seek appropriate actions, postures, and expressions, which is an important condition for animation to avoid its shape becoming formulaic. If painters can make full use of this condition, and do not regard themselves as cameras, and can deal with various details according to the principles of realism rather than naturalism, then the achievement of the image is guaranteed. The Soviet animation artists, who are all for the people, clearly show the noble qualities of the Soviet people, just in terms of the reasonable cooperation between painters and actors.
    These Soviet animated films with a high degree of ideological content and artistry, these Soviet animated films that provide successful examples in production methods, will be widely screened in the people's China. This can not only increase the opportunity to understand the achievements of the Soviet Union in culture, but also provide a model for business learning for Chinese artists who are about to develop various art forms (comic strips, slides...). As long as the business is not limited to a narrow circle, such films are worthy of appreciation and research by artists in all fields. Needless to say, their achievements cannot be introduced by this short essay of impressions, and the author is only writing down these scattered impressions after thanking the Soviet artists and the Chinese dubbing comrades.

    看苏联动画片
    ——“渔夫和金鱼的故事”“黄鹤的故事”“圣诞节的前夜”等

    苏联动画片，儿童热爱，成年人也喜欢。这不仅因为它是一种长于发挥想像和幻想的艺术样式，而且，因为它无例外地是一种思想战线上的武器。不久以前在北京放映过的“费加·哉依采夫”和“怪箱子”等等五彩动画片，也就是具备着高度思想性和艺术性的艺术品。
    “费加·哉依采夫”，是一部讽刺性的教育性的童话片。它叙述一个违反公共道德、在清洁的教室墙上乱画的儿童费加·哉依采夫，由于怯懦，在公众面前隐瞒着自己的错误。这种行为激怒了他所画的小人，激怒了他所喜爱的玩具，它们都反对他，弄得他不能安静。这些离奇古怪的情节，也就是一种切合儿童心理和生活的精神的谴责的力量，促进了费加的内省。这些情节是虚构的，这些形象是幻想的，可是它们和这样一个犯了错误正在抵赖的儿童的不安的心理状态相吻合，因而不使人感到荒谬和怪诞，儿童特别喜欢。虽然这一错误发生在费加身上，可是，就个人与集体的关系而论，就应该用什么态度对待错误这一意义而论，这一电影的教育对象却不局限于儿童。
    在“中苏友好月”里，北京和其它几十个城市，将一次放映数部优美的苏联动画片，其中多数是彩色的，根据普希金有名的诗篇“渔夫和金鱼的故事”编制的同名的动画片，即是其中之一。这些取材于诗、小说、传说和童话的动画片，将进一步让我们认识苏联的年青的却是卓越的动画片的成就。
    这些动画片，如同前面提到过的“费加·哉依采夫”那样，由于发挥了绘画和戏剧、电影的特长，成为引人入胜的艺术品。同时，也因为艺术家们遵循着伟大的列宁、斯大林在文艺上的党性原则，使它们成为教育人民、鼓舞人民前进的武器。例如关于古代的中国，在封建官僚的贪婪和残酷的“统治时期，一个流浪艺人老马的传说”〔注〕的“黄鹤的故事”，也就分明地显示着人民不屈的战斗意志，不可侮的力量，在曲折的斗争中所流露出来的智慧。……
    这些积极的主题思想，不脱离魅人的真实的形象。例如“黄鹤的故事”中，那个流浪人为劳动人民所画的黄鹤，它被官老爷所抢掠，不受豢养也不畏鞭鞑，拒绝为官老爷服务。昂然地站在壁画中的黄鹤，在生了气的官老爷的涂抹之下，一再恢复原形。最后听到老马的召唤，从容地踏过官老爷的头顶，振翼飞走。这些情节，不仅说明人民的艺术不能被反动的统治者所占有，而且黄鹤本身也就是人民的意志、力量和智慧的象征。这种服从着庄严的政治目的的动画片，格调是抒情的，性质是战斗的。正因为它不是徒具物象外表的说明性的符号，正因为它不是用抽象的没有实感的符号来代替活灵活现的艺术形象，所以，作品的主题思想表现得更鲜明，也更便于使观者接受正确的教育意义。
    一提到动画，很容易想到一般的、夸张的、变形的、实感不强的造形。这因为我们曾经接触过一些这种造形的缘故。可是，苏联的动画片，它的吸引人和感动人的力量，不是依靠一般的变形和夸张。当然，既是动画，变形和夸张是容许的，但更重要的是：任何绘画技法的运用，必须服从创造具有真实感的形象这一目的。苏联的动画艺术家遵循着现实主义的优良传统，使这些动画中的人物具有强烈的真实感。就这一特点而论，它不落后于其它样式的电影片。例如“渔夫和金鱼的故事”中的老渔夫，是画的，分明显示着画家的水彩和线描的特长——色彩单纯、鲜明，造形有不必要的枝节的删节，也有必要的要点的夸张。可是，正因为画家抓住了最重要的东西——老渔夫的性格，使观众忘记自己是在看画，以为是面对着这样一个老渔夫。是这样：依靠自己的劳动而不依靠偶然的幸运，朴实、诚恳、善良，他在贪心的不知足的老婆子的逼迫之下，显示着忧愁、埋怨、厌恶。这一个在不得不顺从着老婆子的情况下的老渔夫的造形，是画的，同时也是活的。所谓“活”，当然不是因为他能够在银幕上动，而是因为它使观众忘记是在看画，好像是面对着在这样的环境中生存着和活动着的一个老渔夫。
    造形真实这一特点，也表现在其他几部动画片里。例如根据果戈理的小说改编的“圣诞节的前夜”里的各色各样的人物，那个健壮的快乐的姑娘，那个有力的勇敢的铁匠，那个好色的怯懦的神甫……在造形上，绘画的特色是明显的；可是它们常常使观众不感到是在看画，好像是面对着这些旧俄罗斯乡村中的活人。我们可以毫不夸张地说：这些动画片是高级的绘画，因为它抓住了绘画艺术最重要的东西。
    能够创造如此真实的形象，首先要归功于艺术家们对于脚本的认真研究。“渔夫和金鱼的故事”，也就分明显出艺术家们既忠于普希金的原作的风格，也不忘记动画片是首先诉诸视觉的画，而不是首先诉诸听觉的诗。
    我们记得：普希金在这一首诗里，在结构上强调地保存着民歌的风格。例如老婆子三番五次要老渔夫向金鱼提出各种要求的情节，除了要求不同之外，在语言的结构上甚至用词上，有许多具有照应作用的重复。正因为如此，这首诗不仅具有平易的特点，而且能够使每一次的要求的内容显得格外突出。动画片不仅在结构上、文字说明上保持了这一可爱的风格，即使是构图上和主要人物（老渔夫）的姿态选择上和镜头的角度的安排上，也都力求不损害原诗这一可爱的风格。我们在银幕上看到：老渔夫每一次走到海边那种大体上相同的出场的方向和姿态，也就可以证明笔者这种说法不是没有根据的。可是，正因为绘画不是诗的翻译和注解，所以，随处看得见造形上的创造来。这种创造，不仅表现在不同的情节所引起的人物、背景的形和色的变化的描写上，而且表现在更便于明确体会诗的内容的足以发挥造形上的特长的某些细节的安排和刻画上。例如：为了对照地描写破木盆和好木盆，破木盆的破口中走出来的那一条蜥蜴，和好木盆中涌现的肥皂泡沫，也都是不违反诗的精神而又有利于诗的精神的发挥的造形上的特殊的创造。正因为如此，“渔夫和金鱼的故事”既是“诗”的，同时也是“画”的。
    动画的制作是一种复杂的繁难的工作。为了发挥这一特殊的艺术样式的特长，必须经过十分艰辛的劳动。如何利用模特儿的长处，也就是保证形象真实和生动的必要条件。苏联动画艺术家们在这一点上，和演员有很好的合作方式。“渔夫和金鱼的故事”中的老渔夫，就是请演员伯·齐尔科夫作为模特儿的。正因为人物的造形不是凭空杜撰的而是依靠有修养的演员的帮助的，所以，老渔夫的形象才能够创造得如此生动、真实。优秀的演员能够钻进角色的内心世界，充分理解处于特定环境中的具体人物的心理和情绪，从而寻求适当的动作、姿态、表情，这是使动画避免其造形流于公式化的重要条件。画家如能充分利用这一条件，而且不把自己当成照像机，对于各种细节能够按照现实主义而不是自然主义的原则来处理，那么，形象的成就才有保证。一切为了人民的苏联动画艺术家，仅就画家和演员合理地合作这一点而论，也分明显示着作为苏维埃人民的高贵品质来。
    这一些具有高度思想性和艺术性的苏联动画片，这一些在制作方法上提供了成功范例的苏联动画片，将在人民的中国普遍放映。这不仅可以增加认识苏联在文化上的成就的机会，而且，对于即将发展各种艺术样式（连环画、幻灯……）的中国艺术家，也提供了业务学习上的范例。只要不把业务局限在狭小的圈子里，这样的电影片是值得各方面的艺术家去欣赏和研究的。不用说，它们的成就不是这
    一篇感想式的短文所能介绍，笔者不过在感谢苏联艺术家与中国译片同志之后，写出这一点零碎的印象而已。
