    Jia Chengshou Mutual Aid Team Uses Democratic Discussion to Solve the Problem of Work Delay Caused by Team Leader's Meetings
    To the Editor: The Jia Chengshou Mutual Aid Team in Xujiazhuang, Pingyao County, Shanxi Province, used democratic discussion to solve the problem of excessive work delay caused by the team leader attending meetings. Since the establishment of this mutual aid team in May last year, the problem of the team leader's work delay due to attending meetings had not been properly resolved. The team leader, Jia Chengshou, spent too much time attending meetings, which delayed production, and he felt very unhappy about it. Zhao Risheng, the secretary of the CCP village branch, discovered this problem and convened a meeting of all team members to study solutions. After discussion, everyone agreed that: the team leader attends meetings for the benefit of everyone, and it is unreasonable for him to lose work time alone. Everyone decided that the work time lost by the team leader for attending meetings for the mutual aid team should be recorded according to the following methods: 1. All work time lost for attending meetings during the busy farming season will be recorded; 2. Work time lost for attending meetings during relatively less busy periods will be recorded at 70%; 3. Work time lost for attending meetings during the slack farming season will not be counted, considered fulfilling obligations. Because this method was democratically discussed and stipulated, everyone felt very good after its implementation, which made the mutual aid team more consolidated. 		Zhao Jimao

    贾成寿互助组用民主讨论办法
    解决了组长开会误工问题
    编辑同志：山西平遥县许家庄贾成寿互助组用民主讨论办法，解决了组长因参加开会误工过多的问题。去年五月，这个互助组成立以后，组长开会误工问题一直没有得到适当解决，组长贾成寿开会时间过多，耽误了生产，心里很不痛快。中共村支部书记赵日昇发现了这个问题，就召集全体组员开会，研究解决办法。经过讨论，大家一致认为：组长开会是为了大家，让他一人误工太不合理。大家决定，凡是组长为互助组开会误的工，按下列办法记工：一、农忙时期开会误的工全部记工；二、比较不忙的时期开会误的工，按七成记工；三、农闲时期开会误的工不计，算尽义务。因为这个办法是民主讨论规定的，实行以后，大家都感觉很好，这样就使互助组更加巩固了。    		赵继昌
