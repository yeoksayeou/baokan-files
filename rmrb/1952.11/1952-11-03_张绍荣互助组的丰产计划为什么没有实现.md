Why Zhang Shaorong Mutual Aid Team’s Bumper Harvest Plan Failed
Wei Jiangang

This spring, the Zhang Shaorong Mutual Aid Team in Hongchuan Town, Hongya County, Meishan Special District, Sichuan, learned from the advanced experiences of Li Chenggui and other model rice producers and set a production increase plan to participate in the original West Sichuan District rice bumper harvest competition. The team’s plan was: eight mu and three fen of land to produce 800 jin of rice per mu; five mu and two fen of land to produce 700 jin of rice per mu; seventeen mu and six fen of land to produce 650 jin of rice per mu. Later, after seeing the "sparse planting and dense planting" plan being tested by the Han Hongchun Mutual Aid Team in Qingping Township, Wenjiang, they revised their production increase plan to: a total of thirty-eight mu, five fen and five li of land for the entire team, with an average increase of 170 jin per mu. Among them, nine mu and nine fen of land to produce 900 jin per mu; two mu of experimental high-yield fields to produce 1,000 jin per mu. They also challenged farmers throughout the Meishan Special District with this plan. During the spring plowing production, all team members had high production enthusiasm, and the crops grew well. In particular, the crops in team member Zhang Shaoyuan's one mu and six fen "sparse planting and dense planting" experimental field were the best in Hongya County. From May to August, farmers from many townships in Hongya County came to visit. The visitors all said, "Good crops!" I have been to Jiangjun, Sanbao and other townships under Hongya County, and the district and township cadres and farmers there all asked me, "Do you know about Zhang Shaorong Mutual Aid Team’s fields?" It can be seen that Zhang Shaorong Mutual Aid Team’s high-yield fields have attracted the attention of the majority of farmers in the county.

However, at the end of the autumn harvest, these "crops that you love to death" grew "rice that angers you to death." The entire team's thirty-eight mu, five fen and five li of land only harvested 19,860 jin of yellow rice, with an average increase of only 70 jin per mu, 100 jin less than the original plan. The highest-yielding eight mu and five fen of land only produced about 690 jin per mu (which is a relatively high yield for the village). Not a single mu reached 700 jin. Zhang Shaoyuan's one mu and six fen "sparse planting and dense planting" experimental field also only harvested 650 jin per mu. Not only that, but team members Zhou Wanchun and Zhou Wanqiang's fields even experienced reduced production.

Why did their production increase plan fail to materialize? Why did the crops grow so well, only to end in "empty joy"?

Some may say: perhaps their production increase plan was too ambitious, so it could not be achieved. However, judging from the bumper harvest experiences in various places, their plan was not too high and could have been achieved.

Is it because they were not active and did not work hard enough? That is not the case either. Taking Zhou Wanchun as an example, his six mu and six fen of land used to be planted with seedlings after only one plowing and one harrowing, and he rarely applied base fertilizer, sometimes not even applying top dressing. This year, his fields were generally plowed and harrowed three times each, and he also applied more than 2,000 jin of base fertilizer and more than 2,000 jin of top dressing per mu. Among them, two mu and five fen of land also had 200 jin of oil cake and 400 jin of ash applied.

So where exactly is the problem?

Upon careful examination, the reasons why Zhang Shaorong Mutual Aid Team’s production increase plan failed to materialize are twofold:

一、Errors occurred in farming techniques: (一) They did not grasp the growth laws of crops and did not apply fertilizer in the appropriate amounts and at the appropriate times, but used too much nitrogen fertilizer. Team members generally had the unscientific idea that "it’s always good to apply more manure when implementing sparse planting and dense planting," so they blindly applied too much human manure, animal manure, oil cake, cottonseed and other nitrogen-rich fertilizers, while phosphorus and potassium-rich fertilizers were used very little. Moreover, the time for applying top dressing was mostly when the rice seedlings had stopped tillering and had grown rice stalks, when potassium fertilizer was particularly needed. In addition, the fertilization was not combined with deep plowing (only plowed to a depth of five inches), so many rice plants were flattened.

(二) Transplanting seedlings was too late, and the rice happened to be heading and flowering when the rice stem borers were hatching, so it was not easy to go down to the field to pull out the withered heart seedlings and catch the borers (for fear of knocking off the pollen), so they had to watch the rice seedlings being ravaged by borers.

(三) Most of the rice fields, especially the experimental high-yield fields, were often flooded with more than an inch of water, and the water was even deeper during the rice tillering period. This seriously affected the tillering of the rice.

The factors for obtaining high yields of rice are very complex. When learning the advanced experience of "sparse planting and dense planting," the team only focused on shortening the plant spacing and row spacing to increase the number of seedling hills, and did not consider fertilization, irrigation, pest control and other techniques well, and did not rationally apply various high-yield factors, so technical errors occurred.

二、Problems occurred within the mutual aid team and were not resolved in a timely manner. Since participating in the original West Sichuan District spring plowing production mobilization meeting in March of this year, team leader Zhang Shaorong began to develop complacency and gradually became detached from the masses. In early June, when the mutual aid team was busy weeding, he wanted to weed his own fields first, and then go to weed for others. At that time, deputy team leader Zhou Wanchun criticized him, saying, "If everyone has to do their own work first and then do other people's work, how can we help each other?" Zhang Shaorong not only did not accept the criticism, but lost his temper and said that Zhou Wanchun was scolding him. Zhou Wanchun then stopped caring about the mutual aid team's affairs and pretended to be asleep every night when the meeting was held. In addition, Zhang Shaoyuan (deputy township chief), the backbone of the team, developed the idea of "retreating down the slope," left the township government, and went home to bury himself in production, not attending the mutual aid team's meetings for more than half a month. As a result, the mutual aid team fell into a state of leaderless drift. At this time, the counter-revolutionary element Li Hongzhang (who originally participated in the team but was later expelled) took advantage of the difficulties of some team members lacking food rations and carried out large-scale sabotage. He used the method of lending grain to pull some team members to work for him. Team leader Zhang Shaorong was also pulled over by him with rice. These erroneous behaviors of Zhang Shaorong aroused great dissatisfaction among the majority of team members, and the mutual aid team almost collapsed. This seriously affected the team's weeding and borer control work.

三、The leadership organs of Hongya County did not provide technical guidance or regular political and ideological leadership to the Zhang Shaorong Mutual Aid Team, which was also the reason why this mutual aid team failed to complete its production increase plan. During the spring plowing period, the Hongya County People's Government sent a cadre to help the team formulate a production plan, but no one was sent to provide technical guidance to the team afterward. The cadre who helped the team formulate the production plan himself did not understand technology. He simply promoted the bumper harvest experience of some famous labor models to the team members in a rigid manner, and even told the farmers that oil cake, which is very high in nitrogen, was the fertilizer richest in phosphorus. During the seedling tillering period, a cadre from the original West Sichuan District Agricultural Department also visited the team and blindly guided the team to deepen the irrigation depth to control seedling tillering. In June of this year, when Hongya County held a county-wide production inspection meeting, the Agricultural Production Office of the County People's Government announced that the Zhang Shaorong Mutual Aid Team was directly under the leadership of the county level. However, for a long time after the announcement, no one was sent to take a look. The Hongchuan Town People's Government was the same. At several township cadre meetings, the town chief said, "This time we must promote the Zhang Shaorong Mutual Aid Team to lead the general." But in fact, they had never given the team any concrete help. Although the town chief sometimes went to the Zhang Shaorong Mutual Aid Team, he only walked around the fields. The Town People's Government did not know about the Zhang Shaorong Mutual Aid Team's food shortage problem at first, and it took a long time to realize it and help solve it. Under these circumstances, the disintegration of the Zhang Shaorong Mutual Aid Team could not be resolved in a timely manner.

    张绍荣互助组的丰产计划为什么没有实现
    卫坚岗
    今年春天，四川眉山专区洪雅县洪川镇张绍荣互助组学习了李呈桂等水稻丰产模范的先进经验，订出了增产计划，参加了原川西区的水稻丰产竞赛。该组的增产计划是：八亩三分田每亩产稻谷八百斤；五亩二分田每亩产稻谷七百斤；十七亩六分田每亩产稻谷六百五十斤。后来，他们看到温江清平乡韩洪春互助组试行“疏株密植”的计划，又把增产计划重新修订为：全组三十八亩五分五厘田，平均每亩增产一百七十斤。其中九亩九分田每亩产九百斤；二亩丰产实验田每亩产一千斤。他们并以此计划向全眉山专区的农民挑战。在春耕生产中，全体组员生产热情很高，庄稼也长得很好。特别是组员张绍元的一亩六分“疏株密植”实验田的庄稼，在洪雅县可数第一。从五月到八月之间，洪雅县许多乡的农民纷纷前来参观。参观的人都说：“好庄稼啊！”我曾到过洪雅县属将军、三宝等乡，那里的区、乡干部和农民都询问我：“知道张绍荣互助组的田不知道？”可见张绍荣互助组的丰产田，已为全县广大农民所注意。
    然而，在秋收结束的时候，这些“爱死人的庄稼”却长出了“气死人的谷子”。全组三十八亩五分五厘田，只收了一万九千八百六十斤黄谷，平均每亩只增产七十斤，比原计划少一百斤。产量最高的八亩五分田，每亩产量只有六百九十斤左右（为该村较高的产量）。没有一亩达到了七百斤。张绍元的一亩六分“疏株密植”实验田，每亩也只收了六百五十斤。不仅如此，组员周万春、周万强的田还减产了。
    为什么他们的增产计划没有实现呢？为什么庄稼长得那样好，却落了个“空欢喜”呢？
    可能有人说：大概是他们的增产计划太高了，所以不能实现。但是从各地的丰产经验来看，他们的计划并不算高，是完全能够实现的。
    是不是他们不积极努力呢？也不是的。就以周万春来说，他的六亩六分田，往年一犁一耙就栽秧，很少上底肥，有时连追肥也不上。今年他的田普遍作到了三犁三耙，每亩还上了二千多斤底肥，二千多斤追肥。其中二亩五分田还上了两百斤油枯，四百多斤灰。
    那么问题究竟在那里呢？
    仔细考查起来，张绍荣互助组增产计划没有实现的原因有这两方面：
    一、在耕作技术上发生了错误：（一）没有掌握住作物的生长规律，没有适量、适时地施肥，而多用了氮素肥料。该组组员普遍存在着“实行疏株密植，多上点粪总好”的不科学的想法，于是盲目地过多地施用人粪、畜粪、油枯、棉子等富于氮素的肥料，富于磷、钾的肥料却用得很少。而且上追肥的时间多在稻秧停止分蘖，已长出稻秆，特别需要钾肥的时候。加以施肥没有和深耕结合（只犁了五寸来深），所以许多稻子都倒伏了。
    （二）插秧过迟，稻子恰在三化螟孵化时结穗扬花，这样就不好下田去拔枯心苗和捕螟（怕把花粉撞掉了），只好睁眼看着稻秧子被螟虫糟踏。
    （三）大部稻田，特别是丰产实验田，经常淹着一寸多深的水，在稻子分蘖期间水更深。这样就严重地影响了稻子的分蘖。
    水稻获得高额产量的因素是非常复杂的。该组在学习“疏株密植”的先进经验时，只片面地注意了缩短株距、行距以扩大秧兜的数目，没有很好地考虑到施肥、灌水、除虫等技术，没有合理地运用各种丰产因素，所以发生了技术上的错误。
    二、互助组内发生了问题，没有及时加以解决。组长张绍荣自今年三月参加了原川西区春耕生产动员会议以后，开始滋长了自满情绪，逐渐脱离了群众。在六月上旬，正是互助组忙着薅草的时候，他要先薅自己地里的草，然后才去给别人薅草。当时副组长周万春批评他说：“要是每个人都要先做自己的活，然后才做别人的活，这样怎么能互助起来？”张绍荣不但不接受批评，反发起脾气来，说周万春骂他。周万春于是也不管互助组里的事了，每天晚上开会的时候，就假装睡觉。加以该组的骨干分子张绍元（副乡长）产生了“退坡”思想，离开了乡政府，回家埋头生产，有半个多月不参加互助组的会议。这样一来，这个互助组便陷于没有领导的自流的状态中。这时被管制的反革命分子李洪章
    （原参加该组，后被逐出）便利用一些组员缺乏口粮的困难，大肆进行破坏。他用借给粮食的办法，把一些组员拉去替他做活。组长张绍荣也被他用米拉过去了。张绍荣的这些错误行为，引起大部组员的极大不满，互助组几乎垮台。这就严重地影响了该组的薅草和治螟工作。
    三、洪雅县的领导机关对张绍荣互助组既没有技术指导，也没有经常的政治思想领导，也是这个互助组没有完成增产计划的原因。在春耕期间，洪雅县人民政府派了一个干部，帮助该组订出生产计划，以后再没有派人对该组进行技术指导。帮助该组订生产计划的那位干部自己就不懂技术，他只是生硬地对组员们宣传了一些著名劳动模范的丰产经验，甚至把含氮素很多的油枯当成含磷素最丰富的肥料告给农民。在秧苗分蘖期间，原川西区农业厅的一个干部也曾到过该组，盲目指导该组加深灌水深度，控制秧苗分蘖。今年六月，洪雅县开全县生产检查会议时，县人民政府农业生产办公室曾宣布张绍荣互助组直属县级领导。但宣布以后好久，也没有派个人去看看。洪川镇人民政府也是如此。在好几次乡干部会议上，镇长都说：“这回我们一定要把张绍荣互助组搞起来，以典型带动一般。”但实际上他们对该组一直没有具体帮助。镇长虽有时到张绍荣互助组去一趟，也不过是在田边走一走而已。张绍荣互助组闹缺口粮问题，镇人民政府开始也不了解，一直拖了很长一段时间才发觉，帮助解决了。在这种情况下张绍荣互助组发生的涣散情况，当然不能及时解决。
