The Situation and Experience of Establishing a Branch Instructor Lecture Card System in Daxing County, Hebei Province

    How the Card System Was Established

    Daxing is a new district that established the Party in 1949. The county has 240 branches and the Party members are scattered. The number of county and district committee cadres is small, making it difficult to fully undertake the task of educating Party members. To this end, after June 1950, community education cadres (also known as transmission station chiefs, actually branch education counselors) were established. After July 1951, 74 full and part-time Party member cadres at the county (53 people) and district (21 people) levels were hired to serve as part-time branch instructors, and branch education work bi-weekly meetings and part-time branch instructor lecture card systems were established successively. The Daxing County Party Committee has taken these measures for branch education, so since the establishment of the Party, it has been able to systematically educate Party members on basic Party knowledge and the eight conditions of Party member standards, and conduct education on organizing, opposing coercion and commandism, and half-baked revolutionary ideas according to the stage of work development. This has ensured that branch education can be carried out regularly and gradually improved the awareness of Party members.

    The card system in Daxing County first appeared in the Fifth District. Around the "May Day" in 1951, Liu Ziyi, the District Party Committee, in order to prevent Party members from not attending education stations or branch classes, and to solve the difficulty of community education cadres writing reports, planned a simple form to be filled out by the branch secretaries of each village with the number of Party members attending and absent from lectures at the education station (also known as the transmission station). Later, it was discovered that the number of people filled in by each village was inaccurate, so the projects of signature and seal by the branch负责人负责人 in the attendance and absence numbers and the signature and seal by the part-time instructor were added to indicate joint responsibility. This had a great effect on Party members attending stations on time, branches urging Party members to attend stations, and instructors giving lectures to branch Party members on time. After the county party committee promoted it throughout the county in July, the card with items such as the number of people, time, education content, degree of acceptance by Party members, signature and seal of the branch负责人负责人 and the branch instructor was finally formed.

    The county party committee promoted the experience of the Fifth District. After the provincial and prefectural committee organization and propaganda conferences, the provincial party committee propaganda department issued part-time branch instructor certificates, and the prefectural committee issued unified cards; the card system was established throughout the county and persisted until August without interruption. The Fourth and Fifth Districts insisted the best. When district cadres were concentrated in the county to engage in the "Three-Anti" campaign or were transferred to the prefectural committee to participate in Party rectification training, community education cadres replaced part-time instructors to give lectures and fill out cards. For example, Comrades Tian Zhihou (Banbidian Village Education Station) and Jia Zhenan (Luchengying Education Station) gave lectures to Party members dozens of times from December last year to October this year, and filled out cards and submitted them to the district party committee.

    The Role of the Card System

    The card system is a necessary system for establishing and improving branch education and gradually making branch education regular. Especially at present, when the propaganda and education institutions are not sound, there are no full-time branch instructors, and the level of community education cadres is low, it is necessary to use part-time branch instructors to establish and consolidate this system. There are many benefits. The main ones are briefly described as follows:

    (1) The card system has a supervisory role. First, it can improve the sense of responsibility of part-time branch instructors and earnestly complete the task of giving lectures to branch Party members. Before or just after the establishment of the Daxing card system, the "contract" system (instructors contracting stations and branches) was not implemented. Part-time instructors gave lectures to Party members intermittently. Some part-time instructors (such as the chief of the education section of the county government, cadres of banks and supply and marketing cooperatives, etc.) held the part-time branch instructor certificate issued by the provincial party committee propaganda department and did not give lectures to Party members when they arrived at the branch, but only arranged departmental work; some instructors were "three days fishing, two days drying nets"; some thought that "being an instructor is an extra burden" and did not give lectures to Party members at all. After the card system was established, part-time instructors in each district implemented the "contract" system, according to the content prescribed by the county and district committees (the eight conditions of Party member standards last winter and this spring, organizing this summer), and gave lectures to Party members at the station or branch on time (twice on the first and fifteenth of each month), and submitted cards to the district committee. According to the statistics of Luchengying Education Station in the Fifth District, from December last year to September this year, the district committee, part-time instructors, and community education cadres gave a total of 20 lectures to Party members, of which the number of lectures given by part-time instructors accounted for more than one-third. Another example is Zhang Zhongchen (Minister of Armed Forces), who has given 20 lectures since the establishment of the card system, never missed a class, and can earnestly fill out the cards and submit them to the district committee. Shan Fengshan (Secretary of the Youth League Committee) in the Fourth District gave a total of 24 lectures from October last year to August this year, rain or shine. Once, he rode his bicycle to three villages to give classes in one day. Other comrades such as Chen Ruogong (District Chief of the First District), Wang Xiyi (Secretary of the Youth League Committee of the Fifth District), and the Financial Assistant of the Second District are all good instructors who give lectures on time and earnestly implement the card system. In addition, there are more than a dozen part-time instructors in each district who can contract education stations or branches and give lectures to Party members on time. It can be seen that the card system has a great supervisory role for part-time branch instructors.

    Second, urge branch Party members to earnestly attend classes at the education station and consolidate the learning obligations of Party members with the system. Party members of Banbidian Branch in the Fifth District said: "Whoever delays listening to the lectures will not be able to learn knowledge, and the district committee will know and will be embarrassed again. Who wants to do it?" The item in the cards of the Fifth District requiring the signature and seal of the branch responsible person obviously has a supervisory effect on Party members attending classes.

    Third, it can supervise community education cadres and the district committee, so that in addition to regularly educating Party members and doing a good job in counseling, they also have to earnestly urge Party members to attend classes and ensure the in-depth development of the Party's education work. The district committee cannot but read the cards after they are sent, and if problems are found, they will inevitably be dealt with in a timely manner. The responsible comrades of the district committee of the Fifth District said: "After the implementation of this (card) system, the role of督促督促 the district committee to better care for and improve the branch education work should not be underestimated."

    (2) There are several conveniences in earnestly implementing the card system: First, it is convenient for instructors to listen to the reflections of Party members at any time, improve teaching work, and improve teaching effectiveness. For example, organizer Wang Shu'an reflected that some instructors, when they first came to the branch to give lectures, did not understand the ideological situation of Party members and recited from the book; some instructors were of low level, "a shovel here, a broom there," and Party members did not like to listen. Therefore, some simply played around and slept. After the instructors listened to the reflections of Party members and grasped the center and combined with reality for education, Party members said that "it is a lively class" and their enthusiasm was high. The enthusiasm and initiative of instructors teaching also increased.

    Second, it is convenient for the Party committee to contact Party members and the masses, understand the reflections of Party members at any time, understand the difficulties and requirements of instructors, and then solve these problems and push the Party's education work further. For example, the district committee of the Fifth District, based on the card reports and individual talks, found that Party members "are willing to listen to the district committee's lectures, but not willing to listen to others' lectures" because others cannot explain in depth in connection with current events. Therefore, they introduced the situation of Party members in the whole district to part-time instructors and community education cadres, and talked about the model deeds of the village chief and branch secretary of Shaoge Village and the coercive and commanding style and exploitation thoughts of some Party members; so that instructors and community education cadres could easily combine with reality to conduct education, and effectively solve the ideological problems of Party members in the branch.

    Third, it is convenient for community education cadres to write reports to the district committee, and gradually improve the business level of community education cadres. In the past, they could not write reports because of their low education level, and this difficulty was solved after the instructors helped fill out the cards. Community education cadres have also gradually improved in the long process of listening to lectures by the district committee and part-time instructors and filling out cards. They are an important source for promotion to members of the district committee and general district cadres.

    Finally, due to the earnest implementation of the card system, the relationship between instructors and branches has become closer. At the same time, instructors in non-Party affairs work systems can also understand the work situation and problems of their departments through the branch, and rely on the branch to do a good job in their departments' business work. The aforementioned good part-time branch instructors, in addition to their correct understanding of branch education work, also seriously do branch education work due to the supervisory role of the card system; and understand the work situation of relevant departments from the branch, solving their thoughts that "being a branch instructor and the work of this department are contradictory" and "being an instructor is an extra burden". For example, Shan Fengshan, Secretary of the Youth League Committee of the Fourth District, said: "Originally, I also thought that being an instructor would delay the work of this department, but after being an instructor, I can understand the work and ideological situation of the Youth League members by chatting with Party members. When I do the work of the Youth League or give lectures to the Youth League members, I have a clear idea." Deputy County Chief Guo also said: "Being an instructor and business work do not conflict. You can talk about business work with Party members before and after class. Party members are亲切亲切 after listening to your lectures and are willing to tell you everything. You can understand a lot of business work in the conversation, which is very convenient for work."

    Several Experiences in Establishing and Improving the Card System

    (1) There must be a series of systems such as inspection, summary, criticism, and commendation. In the past, the inspection of cards in each district was to urge part-time branch instructors to hand in the cards through碰头会碰头会. The Fourth and Fifth Districts can also earnestly handle the submitted cards and have appropriate commendation and criticism. With these systems, part-time instructors and community education cadres can fill out the cards more earnestly. The education effect is also better. The part-time instructors in the county-level agencies, because the county party committee did not strictly inspect and deal with them, and the ideological problems such as "being an instructor is an extra burden" were not resolved, although there are 53 instructors, only a few who earnestly give lectures and fill out cards. Therefore, in order to regularize and standardize branch education, in addition to the Party committee's attention and allocation of instructors, the county and district committees must establish earnest inspection, summary, commendation, and criticism systems. Generally, the cards should be stipulated to be managed by the district committee, and the village branch should submit the cards to the district committee once every half month, and the district committee should regularly (provisionally set at one month) inspect and summarize them once. Timely commend the good ones and criticize the bad ones, so that all part-time branch instructors can learn from the good ones to achieve the goal of consolidating the card system. When the district committee reports to the county committee and the county committee reports to the prefectural committee, the implementation of the card system and the problems should be reported as a content of the report and discussion.

    (2) Improve the content of the card and simplify the card filling procedures. After inspection and research, we believe that the cards of the Tongxian Prefectural Committee are too complicated, and the cards created by the Fifth District of Daxing are too simple. The two must learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses. For example, the instructor's lecture experience, the local Party committee's comments, and the signature and seal of the负责人负责人 of the local Party committee and the agency branch on the cards of the Tongxian Prefectural Committee can be removed. The cards of the Fifth District of Daxing have no Party members' reflections or instructor's comments and requirements except for the number of people, time, content, and the seal of the branch负责人负责人 and the instructor, so the cards cannot play their due role. Therefore, we suggest that the content of the cards be changed to: lecture time, location, content, Party members' reflections, instructor's comments and requirements, and the signature and seal of the branch负责人负责人 and the instructor.

    The card filling procedures can also be simplified. The instructor fills out the card (one copy) and submits it to the branch to solicit Party members' reflections and send it to the district committee. In order to report the work situation to the local Party committee or the agency branch, the instructor can attach a form in a small booklet or in the part-time branch instructor certificate, and only fill in the time, location, content, and the seal of the branch负责人负责人 for each item.

    (3) Rectify part-time instructors and establish an instructor lesson preparation system. All Party members who can give lectures to Party members (have time, have political and cultural level) should be given a branch instructor certificate by the Party committee after thinking through it. Otherwise, he should not be allowed to be an instructor. The situation of nominal part-time instructors at the county level in Daxing should not be allowed to exist.

    Instructor lesson preparation is mainly to help instructors solve difficulties, let instructors master the center of the text, and combine with reality for education to improve the education effect. The Fifth District has done a good job in this regard and is worth emulating.

    (4) The scope of card filling should also be expanded. In the past, only part-time instructors filled out cards in Daxing, but the district committee did not fill out cards when giving classes, which is not good. In order to listen to the reflections in a timely manner and improve teaching, all instructors who give lectures to Party members, whether they are district committee cadres or other system cadres, should fill out cards.

    河北省大兴县支部教员授课卡片制度建立的情况和经验
    卡片制度是怎样建立起来的
    大兴是一九四九年建党的新区，全县有支部二百四十个，党员分散。县区委干部少，很难全部担负起向党员进行教育的任务。为此，曾于一九五○年六月以后，建立了小区教育干事（亦称传授站长，实际是支部教育辅导员）。一九五一年七月以后，又聘请了县（五十三人）、区（二十一人）级党员干部七十四人，担任兼职支部教员，并先后建立了支部教育工作半月一次碰头会和兼职支部教员授课卡片等制度。大兴县委对支部教育作了这些措施，所以从建党以来，能根据工作发展阶段，系统地对党员进行党的基本知识与党员标准八项条件的教育，进行组织起来和反对强迫命令、半截革命思想等教育。保证了支部教育得以经常进行，并逐步提高了党员的觉悟。
    大兴县的卡片制度，最初出现于五区。一九五一年“五一节”前后，区委刘子义同志为了防止党员不到教育站或支部上课，并解决小区教育干事写汇报的困难，规划了一种简单的表格，由小区教育干事请各村支书填写党员到教育站（亦称传授站）听课人数与缺席人数。后来发现各村填写的人数有不确实的情形，才又增加了支部负责人在出席和缺席人数上签名盖章和授课的兼职教员签名盖章的项目，以示共同负责。这对党员按时到站听课，支部督促党员到站听课，教员按时给支部党员讲课，有很大作用。七月县委在全县作了推广后，才最后形成了有人数、时间、教育内容、党员接受程度、支部负责人和支部教员签名盖章等项目的卡片。
    县委推广了五区的经验。在省委、地委组织宣传会议后，省委宣传部颁发了兼职支部教员证，地委又发了统一的卡片；卡片制度就在全县范围内建立起来，一直坚持到八月都未曾中断。其中以四、五区坚持最好。在区干部集中县里搞“三反”或被调到地委参加整党训练时，小区教育干事就代替兼职教员讲课，并填写卡片。如田致厚（半璧店村教育站）、贾镇安（芦成营教育站）二同志，去年十二月到今年十月，都曾向党员讲课十数次，并填写卡片送交区委。
    卡片制度的作用
    卡片制度是建立与健全支部教育，使支部教育逐渐走向正规化的一种必要的制度。特别是在目前宣传教育机构不健全，无专职支部教员，小区教育干事水平低，必须使用兼职支部教员的情况下，树立与巩固这一制度，有很多好处。举其要者简述如下：
    （1）卡片制度有监督作用。第一、它可以提高兼职支部教员责任心，认真负责地去完成给支部党员讲课的任务。大兴卡片制度建立前或刚建立时，没有实行“包干”制度（教员包站、包支部），兼职教员给党员讲课，时断时续。有些兼职教员（如县政府教育科长、银行和供销社的干部等），拿着省委宣传部发的兼职支部教员证，到支部不给党员上课，光布置部门工作；有些教员是“三天打鱼，两天晒网”；有的认为“当教员是额外负担”，根本不给党员上课。在卡片制度建立起来后，各区兼职支部教员到支部讲课，多实行了“包干”制度，按县委区委规定的内容（去冬今春讲党员标准八项条件、今夏讲组织起来），按期（初一、十五两次）到站或支部给党员讲课，向区委交卡片。据五区芦成营教育站统计，去年十二月至今年九月，区委、兼职教员、小区教育干事共给党员讲课二十次，其中兼职教员讲课次数就占了三分之一强。另如张忠臣（武装部长）从建立卡片制度以来，讲课二十次，一次也没缺过课，并能认真填写卡片送交区委。四区单凤山（团委书记），去年十月到今年八月，先后共讲课二十四次，风雨无阻。有一次，曾骑着车子，一天跑三个村上课。其他像陈若功（一区区长）、王锡义（五区团委书记）、二区财政助理员等同志，都是按时讲课认真执行卡片制度的好教员。另外各区还有十余个兼职教员，都能包教育站或包支部，按时给党员上课。可见卡片制度对兼职支部教员的督促作用是很大的。
    第二、督促支部党员认真到教育站上课，把党员的学习义务用制度巩固起来。五区半璧店支部党员说：“谁耽误听课，谁就不能学到知识，区委知道又要弄大红脸。谁愿干？”五区的卡片内要求支部负责人签名盖章一项，对党员上课的督促作用是很显然的。
    第三、可以监督小区教育干事和区委，使他们除了经常教育党员，做好辅导工作外，还不得不认真地督促党员上课，保证党的教育工作的深入。卡片送来后区委就不能不看，发现了问题，也就必然要及时去处理。五区区委负责同志说：“这个（卡片）制度实行后，对督促区委更好地关心和改进支部教育工作的作用，是很不应当轻视的。”
    （2）认真执行卡片制度还有几种方便：首先是便于教员随时听取党员的反映，改进教学工作，提高教学效果。如组织员王书安同志反映：有些教员刚到支部讲课时，因不了解党员思想情况，照本念；有的教员水平低，“这里一锨，那里一扫帚”，党员就不喜欢听。因而有的干脆闹着玩，睡大觉。当教员听取了党员反映，抓住中心、联系实际进行教育后，党员就说“是听活课”，情绪很高。教员教课情绪与积极性也就提高。
    第二、便于党委联系党员群众，随时了解党员的反映，了解教员的困难和要求，进而解决这些问题，把党的教育工作推进一步。如五区区委曾根据卡片报告和个别谈话，发现党员“愿听区委讲，不愿听别人讲”，是由于别人不能联系当前事例深入讲解。因此便向兼职教员、小区教育干事介绍了全区党员状况，讲了邵格庄村长与支书的模范事迹和某些党员的强迫命令作风和剥削思想；使教员与小区教育干事便于联系实际，进行教育，有力地解决了支部党员中的思想问题。
    第三、便于小区教育干事向区委写汇报，并逐渐提高小区教育干事的业务水平。他们过去因文化低，不能写汇报，教员帮助填卡片后，这个困难就解决了。小区教育干事，在长期听区委和兼职教员讲课和填卡片的过程中，也逐渐得到了提高。他们是提拔成为区委委员和一般区干部的重要来源。
    最后，由于认真执行卡片制度，教员和支部的关系密切了。同时，非党务工作系统的教员，还可以通过支部了解了本部门的工作情况和问题，依靠支部做好本部门的业务工作。前述好的兼职支部教员，除了他们对支部教育工作有正确的认识外，还由于卡片制度的督促作用，使他们认真地去做支部教育工作；并从支部了解了有关本部门的工作情况，解决了他们认为“当支部教员和本部门工作矛盾”、
    “当教员是额外负担”的思想。如四区团委书记单凤山说：“原来我也认为当教员要耽误本部门工作，但当了教员后，可以通过与党员闲谈聊天的方式，了解青年团员的工作和思想情况。自己做团的工作或给团员讲课，心里就有了底。”郭副县长也说：“当教员和业务工作并不冲突，课前课后都可以和党员谈业务工作。党员听你讲了课就亲切，什么话也愿告你说，你可以在谈话中了解很多业务工作情况，对工作很方便。”
    建立和健全卡片制度的几点经验
    （1）必须有检查、总结、批评、表扬等一系列的制度。过去各区对卡片的检查，是通过碰头会向兼职支部教员催要卡片。四、五区还能对交了的卡片认真处理，并有适当表扬与批评。有了这些制度，兼职教员和小区教育干事，就能比较认真的填写卡片。教育效果也较好。县里各机关的兼职教员，因县委未严格检查与处理，再加认为“当教员是额外负担”等思想问题未解决，虽有五十三个教员，但是认真讲课与填写卡片的还是少数。所以，为了使支部教育经常化和正规化起来，除了党委重视，配备教员外，县委区委必须建立认真的检查、总结、表扬和批评等制度。一般卡片应规定由区委管理，村支部半月向区委交一次卡片，区委定期
    （暂定一月）检查总结一次。及时表扬好的，批评不好的，使所有兼职支部教员向好的看齐，以达巩固卡片制度的目的。区委向县委以及县委向地委汇报教育工作时，要把卡片制度执行的情况和问题作为一项汇报讨论的内容。
    （2）改进卡片内容，简化卡片填写手续。经过检查研究，我们认为通县地委卡片太繁琐，大兴五区创造的卡片太简单，二者必须互相取长补短。比如通县地委卡片上的教员讲课心得、当地党委意见、当地党委和机关支部负责人签名盖章等项都可去掉。大兴五区的卡片除了人数、时间、内容、支部负责人与教员盖章外，党员反映、教员意见都没有，这样就不能使卡片发挥应有的作用。所以我们建议卡片内容改为：讲课时间、地点、内容、党员反映、教员意见和要求、支部负责人与教员签名盖章等项目。
    在卡片的填写手续上也可以简化，教员填好卡片
    （一份）即交支部征求党员反映，送区委。教员为了向当地党委或机关支部报告其工作情况，可在一小册子或在兼职支部教员证里附表，每项只填时间、地点、内容、支部负责人盖章等项。
    （3）整顿兼职教员，建立教员备课制度。凡能够给党员上课（有时间，有政治和文化水平）的党员，都应由党委打通思想，发给支部教员证。否则，就不应让他当教员。像大兴县级多数兼职教员的挂名情形，是不应允许存在的。
    教员备课，主要是帮教员解决困难，让教员掌握课文中心，联系实际进行教育，以提高教育效果。五区在这方面做得好，值得效法。
    （4）卡片填写范围，也应扩大。过去大兴只是兼职教员填写卡片，区委上课则不填卡片，这是不好的。为了及时听取反映，改进教学，今后凡给党员讲课的教员，无论区委或其他系统干部，应一律填写卡片。
