Tangshan Public Stone Company Accepts Criticism but Fails to Improve Actual Work

To the Editors: Your spirit of responsibility towards the masses is commendable. After receiving your letter checking on the results of the criticism, we specifically visited the workers of the Tangshan Public Stone Company and discovered that the company has adopted an extremely erroneous attitude of perfunctoriness and deception in dealing with newspaper criticism (the original letter of criticism was published on the "Reader's Letters" page on June 25th). The company's self-examination and reply to the criticism (published on the "Reader's Letters" page on July 23rd) contained many lies, and some of the proposed methods for improving work in the reply have not been implemented even after three months. We are now writing down the actual situation below:

Regarding the issue of deducting tool fees from workers' wages, the company's reply stated: "At that time, due to the limitations of cadres and equipment conditions, the workers' representative meeting agreed to include tool fees in the workers' wages, allowing workers to provide their own tools. Later, some quarrying tools were purchased uniformly by the company." However, according to the workers we spoke with, this is not the truth. The real situation is: In 1951, the company's former manager, Ren Yan, announced at a general meeting of workers that because the company's financial situation was not good, tools would temporarily be provided by the workers themselves; the company would provide them in 1952. In this way, the company deducted tool fees from workers' wages every month, and there was still no change in 1952. The company's reply also stated: "Although this is not a deduction of wages, the relationship with the workers is abnormal. We are planning to correct it." More than three months have passed since the criticism, and the company is still deducting tool fees from workers' wages. Is this not knowing wrong and refusing to correct it?

Regarding the issue of receiving more stones and giving less money when measuring stones, the company's reply stated that it was an individual situation and attributed the reason to "some measurers lacking experience." But in reality, this situation is widespread and has not changed to this day. The reason is that the measurers still treat the workers with a bourgeois management perspective.

Although the company reviewed the phenomenon of accumulated waste rock and admitted that it was caused by "a lack of planning in production and insufficient attention to workers' opinions," what is the situation now? Even more waste rock is piled up. Every day, the entire mountain uses three hundred people to dump waste rock elsewhere; otherwise, the workers cannot work. The workers raise opinions, but the administration still ignores them.

The problem of the company's poor medical equipment has not been well resolved to this day. The clinic starts work later than the workers and gets off work earlier than the workers. Many workers can only go outside for treatment when they get sick.

In short, although the company's leading cadres have reviewed the newspaper's criticisms, they have not truly recognized that the reason for this situation is their lack of ideas about relying on the working class to run the enterprise well, their lack of concern for the workers' suffering, and their lack of attention to workers' opinions. They also mistakenly use "the company was established not long ago and has a weak foundation" as an excuse and do not try to improve their work.

We hope that you will again make strict criticisms of the company's erroneous attitude towards criticism, and suggest that its higher-level leadership organs seriously inspect the company's work and urge them to make effective improvements.

### 唐山公营石头公司接受批评后却未改进实际工作

专栏：正确地对待批评和自我批评

    唐山公营石头公司接受批评后却未改进实际工作
    编辑同志：你们这种对群众负责的精神很好。我们收到你们检查批评结果的来信后，特地去访问了唐山市公营石头公司的工人同志们，发现该公司对待报纸批评采取了极端错误的应付、欺骗的态度（原批评信刊六月二十五日“读者来信专页”）。该公司对批评的检讨和答复（刊七月二十三日“读者来信专页”）中有许多是谎话，而答复中所提出的某些改进工作的办法，到现在三个月了还没付之实施。现在我们把实际情况写在下面：
    关于从工人工资中扣除工具费的问题，该公司答复信说：“当时由于干部及设备条件的限制，经工人代表会研究同意，在工人工资内加发工具费，让工人自备工具。后来有些采石工具由公司统一购置。”但据和我们谈话的工人们说，这不是事实。真实情况是：一九五一年该公司前任经理任言在全体工人大会上宣布，因公司经济情况不好，工具暂由工人自备；到一九五二年即可由公司发给。就这样，该公司就按月在工人工资内扣工具费，到一九五二年还是没有改变。该公司答复信中又说：“这虽不是克扣工资，但和工人关系是不正常的。我们正计划加以纠正。”批评至今已三个多月了，该公司还是从工人工资中扣工具费。这不是知错不改吗？
    关于收量石头时多收石头少给钱的问题，该公司答复中说是个别情况，并把原因推之于“有些收量人员缺乏经验”。但实际上这种情况是普遍的，到现在仍旧没有改变，原因是收量人员仍用资产阶级的经营观点来对待工人。
    该公司对积压毛碴的现象，虽检讨了这是“生产上缺乏计划，且对工人意见重视不够”所致。但是，现在情况怎样呢？毛碴堆得更多了。全山每天用三百余人向别处倒毛碴，否则工人就没法干活。工人们提出意见，行政方面还是不理会。
    该公司医疗设备太坏的问题，至今也没很好解决。医疗所上班比工人迟，下班比工人早，很多工人有了病只能到外边去治。
    总之，该公司领导干部对报纸的批评虽然作了检讨，但并没真正认识发生这种情况的原因是他们缺乏依靠工人阶级搞好企业的思想，对工人疾苦不关心，对工人意见不重视。他们还错误地以“公司建立不久，基础较差”作藉口，并不设法改进工作。
    我们希望你们对该公司这种对待批评的错误态度再提出严格批评，并建议其上级领导机关认真检查该公司的工作，督促他们作有效的改进。
