(Xinhua News Agency, 3rd) According to TASS: The Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee of the United Nations General Assembly concluded its general debate on the issue of freedom of information on October 29th. Representatives from Middle Eastern countries (Afghanistan, Lebanon, Iraq, Saudi Arabia) and Latin American countries (Bolivia, Guatemala, Chile), in their speeches, expressed anxiety about foreign companies, trusts, and syndicates controlling the news industries of their respective countries.

When talking about the situations of monopoly capitalist groups suppressing the news industries of their respective countries, the representatives of these countries emphasized that American monopoly capitalist groups exerted pressure on public opinion, forcing people to accept social ideas that these monopoly capitalist groups considered agreeable. If the domestic policies of these countries did not please the American monopoly capitalist groups, they would spread false and slanderous news about the domestic policies of these countries.

The representative of Afghanistan said: Small countries suffer from the propaganda carried out by foreign monopoly capitalist groups. The representative of Bolivia said: Those companies buy journalists like buying servants. He said that the business of news is as dangerous as the business of arms. The representative of Guatemala described how American monopoly capitalist groups controlled the news industry in his country. He emphasized that foreign monopoly capitalist groups had organized a propaganda campaign to oppose Guatemala's implementation of land reform.

When speaking, the representative of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, Novikova, urged the committee to discuss in detail the suggestions put forward by the Soviet delegation that were consistent with the UN's current tasks in the area of freedom of information; these suggestions stipulated that publishing organs and news organizations should not be subject to the suppression and direction of private publishing monopoly groups, trusts, and syndicates engaged in the propagation of national hatred. The representatives of Ukraine, Poland, and Czechoslovakia also seconded the Soviet proposal.

The committee has been discussing the various proposals submitted to the committee since October 30th.

    中东及拉丁美洲各国联大代表
    斥美国压制各国新闻事业
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社讯：十月二十九日联合国大会社会、人道与文化委员会已结束了关于新闻自由问题的一般辩论。中东各国（阿富汗、黎巴嫩、伊拉克、沙特阿拉伯）和拉丁美洲国家（玻利维亚、危地马拉、智利）的代表们，在发言中对于外国公司、托辣斯和辛迪加控制各该国新闻事业都表示焦虑。
    这些国家的代表们谈起垄断资本集团对各该国新闻事业横加压制的情形时，强调指出：美国垄断资本集团对舆论施以压力、逼人接受这些垄断资本集团认为合意的社会思想，如果各该国的对内政策不能使美国垄断资本集团称心如意时，就散布虚妄的诽谤各该国的对内政策的消息。
    阿富汗的代表说：小国由于外国垄断资本集团所进行的宣传而受到损害。玻利维亚的代表说：那些公司收买记者像收买奴才一样。他说新闻方面的买卖和军火买卖同样危险。危地马拉的代表叙述美国垄断资本集团如何控制该国的新闻事业。他强调指出：外国垄断资本集团曾组织一种宣传运动，以反对危地马拉实施土地改革。
    白俄罗斯共和国的代表诺维科娃发言时敦促委员会详细讨论苏联代表团所提出的与联合国在新闻自由方面的当前任务符合一致的建议；这些建议规定：应使出版机关与新闻机关不受那些从事宣传民族仇恨的私人出版界垄断集团、托辣斯和辛迪加的压制和指使。乌克兰、波兰及捷克斯洛伐克的代表们也都附议苏联的提案。
    委员会已从十月三十日起讨论向委员会提出的各种提案。
