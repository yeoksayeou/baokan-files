Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Tikhonov, head of the Soviet cultural workers delegation, and Tamara Hanon, a member of the Soviet art troupe, arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou and Xuzhou respectively. Zakharov and others departed from Chongqing for Shanghai. Soviet artists performed in Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places.

Tikhonov and Others Arrive in Shanghai from Hangzhou
    Tikhonov, head of the Soviet cultural workers delegation, and delegation members Grusenko and Yefimov arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou at noon on the 26th. Welcoming them at the station were Chen Wangdao, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association of East China; Pan Hannian, Xia Yan, and Li Zhaohuan, Vice Presidents of the Shanghai Sino-Soviet Friendship Association; Sheng Pihua, Deputy Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government; cultural and artistic figures from East China and Shanghai; and representatives of workers, youth, and women in Shanghai, totaling more than 5,000 people. Soviet Consul General in Shanghai, Shchetel, and others also welcomed them at the station.
    A welcome meeting was held in the station square. Pan Hannian, Vice President of the Shanghai Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the people of East China and Shanghai. Tikhonov delivered a reply speech amidst the incredibly warm cheers of the crowd. With rich emotion and poetic language, he said: This time, we came to China and happily saw many cities, but today, when we arrived in Shanghai, we had a special feeling. Because the Soviet people knew very early that the great Communist Party of China was founded in Shanghai in 1921; in 1925, the great Chinese revolutionary movement began with the May 30th Movement in Shanghai. The Soviet people also knew very early that in 1926-1927, the glorious proletariat launched the great three uprisings in Shanghai. When the workers of Shanghai occupied Shanghai, all the people of the Soviet Union felt joyful and encouraged. Tikhonov then powerfully described the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, saying: The Soviet people warmly welcome the great achievements of the fraternal Chinese people in all aspects and will use all their strength and experience and all their wisdom to help the Chinese people in peaceful construction.
