Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 7th: TASS Moscow, November 7th dispatch: Nearly a million Muscovites participated in the grand parade commemorating the 35th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. They marched in columns from various districts of Moscow, passing through Red Square, demonstrating their unity and their close solidarity around the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government.

The parade began at noon. At the head of the procession were renowned Stakhanovite workers, outstanding scientists, and cultural workers from the capital's factories. They carried Moscow's banner adorned with the Order of Lenin, a high award bestowed upon the city of Moscow five years ago during the 800th anniversary of its founding.

Today's parade once again demonstrated the Soviet people's struggle for international friendship and peace. Thousands of placards and banners bore the word "Peace." The people of Moscow also extended fraternal greetings to all peoples fighting against imperialist aggressors and instigators of new wars, and for peace, democracy, and socialism.

The capital's athletes, healthy, strong, and brave young men and women, marched in neat formations, cheering Stalin and the leaders of the Party and government along the way. Resounding shouts of "Hurrah" shook the walls of the Kremlin.

Columns from Moscow's twelve districts entered Red Square simultaneously. At the front of the procession was a sea of flags, portraits of Lenin and Stalin, the founders of the Soviet state, portraits of Party and government leaders, and red banners bearing slogans issued by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The cheers of "Glory to Stalin!" echoed continuously across Red Square. Many banners bore the slogan written in gold letters: Workers, peasants, and intellectuals of the Soviet Union! Victoriously complete the historic tasks set by the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union! Achieve new victories in communist construction!

The people of Moscow reported their achievements in the nationwide socialist competition to welcome the October Revolution anniversary during the parade. Colorful murals, placards, and charts displayed the labor enthusiasm of Soviet men and women, showing their willingness to contribute all their strength to strive for the earliest possible transition from socialism to communism. Personnel from Moscow's major factories completed their production pledges ahead of schedule in preparation for the October holiday.

Machine tool builders from the Red Proletarian Factory marched through Red Square holding portraits of thirty-seven production innovators from their factory – recipients of Stalin Prizes. This factory exceeded its ten-month plan, producing two hundred more highly efficient machine tools, saving five million rubles by reducing production costs, and organized the continuous production of fourteen new machine tools.

Renowned steelworkers from the Hammer and Sickle Steel Plant proudly carried the red flag. The Order of Lenin and the Order of the Red Banner of Labor glittered on the giant model of the factory's emblem. The entire staff of this factory earned these two orders through their selfless labor. Inspired by the resolutions of the 19th Party Congress, the steelworkers overfulfilled the ten-month plan, producing thousands of tons of steel and rolled metal beyond the plan.

As the workers of the Three Hills Textile Factory marched through Red Square, colorful textiles fluttered in the air. Since the beginning of this year, they have produced 1.5 million meters of textiles above the plan. In ten months, they produced 700,000 meters of textiles with saved cotton and yarn.

The column from the Paris Commune Shoe Factory carried portraits of new labor heroes. These labor heroes completed their tasks ahead of schedule and began implementing their 1953 plan several months ago. Most of the other workers also learned from the example of their advanced comrades and have already completed their annual plans.

The music from many orchestras and military bands blended with songs praising the happy life of the Soviet people, the great Communist Party, and Stalin. The slogans issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union were written on placards and banners. The number "35," signifying thirty-five years of struggle and great victories in socialist construction, appeared constantly.

The Party's battle cry: "Under the banner of Lenin, under the leadership of Stalin, march towards the victory of communism!" was written on a giant brocade banner. This banner fluttered in front of the column of scientists – academicians, professors, and staff members of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and various research institutes.

Also participating in the parade were students and professors from Moscow University and other institutions of higher learning in the capital. They held aloft models of the classics of Marxism-Leninism – books from which millions of people learn how to live, how to work, and how to fight for communism. There were also many giant models of Stalin's "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" – a new and brilliant work, a powerful ideological weapon in the struggle for communism. Many placards bore the full text of the basic economic law of socialism discovered by Stalin: ensuring the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society through the continuous growth and improvement of socialist production on the basis of higher technology. Thousands of placards bore slogans calling on the Soviet working people to launch a nationwide socialist competition to complete and overfulfill the Fifth Five-Year Plan, which once again demonstrates to the world the great vitality of socialism and the fundamental superiority of the socialist economic system over the capitalist economic system.

The parade had been going on for several hours, and an endless stream of people continued to pour into Red Square from all directions. Among them were workers and engineers from major enterprises, the Stalin Automobile Factory, the Kaganovich Ball Bearing Factory, the Dynamo Factory, and other factories, staff members of state organs, and Moscow actors. The decorations of each column vividly reflected the creative efforts of the Soviet people. The working people of the Kalinin District entered Red Square carrying huge murals. One of them depicted Lenin against the background of the GOELRO plan – the first state plan for the electrification of the Soviet country.

Another mural depicted Stalin against the backdrop of the great communist construction projects. Placards and banners emphasized the extreme importance of these projects for the further development of the Soviet economy. Stalin's plan to transform nature is being successfully implemented. The Volga-Don Canal has been completed. Protective forest belts have been planted on millions of hectares of land, and hydroelectric projects on the Volga, Dnieper, and Amu Darya rivers are underway. Almost all of Moscow's largest factories are manufacturing orders for the great communist construction projects. Today, personnel from these factories reported with pride that they had completed many important tasks ahead of schedule. Moscow is supplying the great construction projects with automobiles, electric motors, transformers, machine tools, bearings, and other equipment.

In the parade procession were thousands of builders, whose labor is changing the face of Moscow, constructing many high-rise buildings, exquisite apartment houses, schools, and clubs.

Staff members from the Ministry of Agriculture walked across Red Square carrying huge ears of wheat, holding banners that read: "The total grain harvest in 1952 reached 8 billion poods!" Thousands of placards cited the figures and tasks stipulated in the directives of the 19th Party Congress regarding the Fifth Five-Year Plan, illustrating the new and brilliant prospects unfolding before the Soviet state. Countless red flags bore the inscription: "Forward to Communism!"

The parade procession extended warm greetings to the many foreign guests on Red Square. They also paid fraternal respects to all peoples fighting against imperialist aggressors and instigators of new wars, for peace, democracy, and socialism.

The words of the great Stalin were written on slogans from all directions:
"Long live international peace! Down with the warmongers!"
Many banners bore the slogans of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union:
"Long live the foreign policy of the Soviet Union – a policy of peace, security, international cooperation, development, and communication with the affairs of all countries!" "Peace defenders of the world! Expose and shatter the evil plans of the imperialist aggressors, and do not allow the war-mongers to ensnare the masses with lies, deceive them, and entice them to participate in a new world war!" The people of Moscow congratulated the working people of the people's democratic countries who are victoriously building a socialist society, and the great Chinese people who have made new achievements in the construction work of the powerful People's Democratic China.

Paraders held aloft the portraits of Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and Liu Shaoqi, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

The paraders also held aloft the portraits of Bolesław Bierut, President of the Polish People's Republic, and Józef Cyrankiewicz, Prime Minister, Klement Gottwald, President of the Czechoslovak Republic, and Antonín Zápotocký, Prime Minister, Vulko Chervenkov, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, Georgi Damyanov, Chairman of the Presidium of the National Assembly of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, Mátyás Rákosi, General Secretary of the Hungarian Working People's Party, István Dobi, Chairman of the Presidential Council of the Hungarian People's Republic, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, General Secretary of the Romanian Workers' Party, Constantin Parhon, Chairman of the Presidium of the Grand National Assembly of the Romanian People's Republic, Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour, Haxhi Lleshi, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Albania, and Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal, General Secretary of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party.

The parade procession paid tribute to the German people who are fighting for the earliest possible conclusion of a peace treaty in line with the interests of the German people and world peace, and for the establishment of a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving Germany. They held aloft the portraits of Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic, Otto Grotewohl, Prime Minister, and Walter Ulbricht, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany.

The people of Moscow paid tribute to the heroic Korean people who are waging a valiant struggle against foreign aggressors and defending the freedom and independence of their motherland. They carried the portraits of Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Kim Tu-bong, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. They also carried the portrait of Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The slogan of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, "Long live the friendship of the peoples of Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in the struggle to prevent war and strive for lasting world peace!" could be seen from all directions. Paraders marched across Red Square holding the portraits of Maurice Thorez, leader of the French people, Palmiro Togliatti, leader of the Italian people, William Z. Foster, leader of the American revolutionary working class, Dolores Ibárruri, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Spain, and Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain.

As the endless tide of the parade procession poured through Red Square, a chorus of cheers rang out for the great Stalin, for the unbreakable friendship of the peoples of the Soviet Union, and for the powerful Soviet state – the bulwark of world peace. The parade lasted nearly four hours. The last to pass through was a large group of athletes, who entered Red Square holding huge letters spelling out "Forward to the Victory of Communism!"

As the Soviet state enters its thirty-sixth year, the working people of Moscow, with a joyful and rich holiday parade, expressed their readiness and unwavering will to fulfill the historic resolutions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the tasks set by Stalin's Fifth Five-Year Plan, and to build a communist society with all their might.

    莫斯科近百万人举行大游行
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科七日讯：将近一百万莫斯科人民参加了伟大的十月社会主义革命三十五周年纪念游行。他们从莫斯科的各区列成纵队前进，走过红场，表现了他们的团结一致，表现了他们是紧密地团结在苏联共产党和苏维埃政府周围的。
    游行在中午开始。行列最前面是首都各工厂中著名的斯塔哈诺夫式工作者、卓越的科学家和文化工作者。他们举着莫斯科的饰有列宁勋章的旗帜，这个崇高的奖品是在五年前的莫斯科建市八百周年纪念日授与莫斯科市的。
    今天的游行又一次证明了苏联人民在为国际友谊与和平而斗争。数以千计的标语牌和横旗上都写着“和平”。莫斯科人民并向所有为反对帝国主义侵略者和新战争挑拨者、为和平、民主与社会主义而斗争的人民致兄弟的祝贺。
    首都的运动员都是一些健康、强壮、勇敢的男女青年，他们排着整齐的队伍前进，沿路欢呼斯大林和党与政府的领袖们。雄壮的“乌拉”声震动着克里姆林宫的宫墙。
    莫斯科十二个区的队伍同时进入红场。队伍前面是由各种旗帜、苏维埃国家的缔造者——列宁和斯大林的画像、党和政府领袖们的画像以及写着苏联共产党所发布的口号的红色横旗所形成的旗海。“斯大林光荣！”的欢呼声不停地在红场上回响。在许多横旗上用金字写着下面的口号：苏联的工人、农民和知识分子们！胜利地完成苏联共产党第十九次代表大会规定的历史任务！在共产主义建设中取得新的胜利！
    莫斯科人民在游行中报告了他们在迎接十月节的全国社会主义竞赛中取得的成就。五光十色的板画、标语牌和图表显示了苏维埃男女的劳动热情，显示了他们贡献全部力量为尽早由社会主义过渡到共产主义而斗争的意愿。莫斯科各大工厂的人员提前完成了他们为迎接十月节而提出的生产保证。
    红色无产者工厂的工作母机制造者举着他们工厂中的三十七个生产革新者——斯大林奖金获得者——的画像走过红场。这个工厂超过十个月的计划，多生产了二百部效率很高的工作母机，用减低生产成本的方法节省了五百万卢布并组织了十四个新工作母机的连续生产。
    锤子与镰刀钢铁厂的著名钢铁工人高举着红旗。列宁勋章和劳动红旗勋章在这个工厂的厂徽的巨大模型上闪闪发光。这个工厂的全体人员以他们的忘我劳动获得了这两个勋章。钢铁工人们在第十九次党代表大会决议的鼓舞下，超额完成了十个月计划，超过计划多生产了数千吨钢和压延金属。
    当三山纺织厂的工人走过红场时，五彩缤纷的纺织品在空中飞舞。自从今年年初起，他们已超计划多生产了一百五十万公尺的纺织品。在十个月中，他们用节省下来的棉花及棉纱生产了七十万公尺的纺织品。
    巴黎公社鞋厂的队伍举着新的劳动英雄们的画像。这些劳动英雄们提前完成了任务，并且在几个月以前就已开始执行他们一九五三年的计划了。其余大多数工人也学习他们的先进伙伴的榜样，已经完成了一年的计划。
    许多管弦乐队和军乐队奏出的乐曲和歌颂苏联人民的幸福生活、歌颂伟大的共产党、歌颂斯大林的歌声交融在一起。标语牌和横旗上，都写着苏联共产党中央委员会发布的口号。“三十五”，这个意味着三十五年的斗争和社会主义建设的伟大胜利的字不断出现。
    党的战斗号召：“在列宁的旗帜下，在斯大林的领导下，朝着共产主义的胜利前进！”写在一面巨大的锦旗上。这面锦旗在科学家们——苏联科学院的院士、教授和各研究所的工作者们——的队伍前面飘扬。
    参加游行的还有莫斯科大学及首都其他高等学校的学生和教授们。他们高举着马克思列宁主义经典著作——千百万人民从其中学习如何生活、如何工作和如何为共产主义而斗争的书籍——的模型。还有许多斯大林的“苏联社会主义经济问题”——新的天才著作、共产主义斗争的有力的思想武器——的巨大模型。许多标语牌上写着斯大林所发现的社会主义基本经济法则的全文：用在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善的办法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。成千的标语牌上写着标语，号召苏联劳动人民展开全国范围的社会主义竞赛，以完成和超额完成第五个五年计划，这个计划又一次向全世界表明了社会主义的伟大活力，表明了社会主义经济制度较之资本主义经济制度具有根本的优越性。

    在游行行列中有数以千计的建筑者，他们的劳动正在改变莫斯科的面貌，他们在建筑许多高楼大厦，精美的公寓房屋、学校和俱乐部。
    农业部的工作人员高举着巨大的麦穗走过红场，他们拿着的横旗上写着：“一九五二年的谷物总收获量达八十亿普特！”数以千计的标语牌上援引第十九次党代表大会关于第五个五年计划的指示中的数字和规定的任务、说明展开在苏维埃国家前面的新的灿烂远景。无数的红旗上写着：“向共产主义前进！”
    游行行列向红场上的许多外宾发出热烈的欢呼。他们也向所有为反对帝国主义侵略者和新战争挑拨者，为和平、民主与社会主义而斗争的人民致兄弟的敬礼。
