The Peasant Revolutionary Hero Song Jingshi and His Black Flag Army
-- Highlights of the "Historical Investigation Report on Song Jingshi"
Chen Baichen (Continued from yesterday)

　　The Song Jingshi Black Flag Army began fighting with the landlord armed forces at the end of the first month of the second year of Tongzhi; it was not until May of that year that they entered a state of combat with the Manchu Qing government's army. From early February to the end of April, the Black Flag Army's attitude towards the Manchu Qing army was what the landlord class called "semi-private and semi-official": they were stationed in Guantao, Tangyi, and other areas, "coming and going freely," and the Qing army did not dare to interfere. "They simply did not openly confront the government army." Instead, they put all their strength into dealing with the landlord armed forces. The reason for doing so seems to be a division of labor in cooperation with Zhang Xizhu, Zhang Yuhuai, and others. Because the Black Flag Army kept an eye on the landlord armed forces based in Liulin and Fan Village, Zhang Xizhu and others could maneuver freely to deal with the troops of the Manchu Qing government. This is what the Manchu Qing Shandong Surveillance Censor Wang Langu said in his memorial: "They actually formed a strategic alliance with the bandits (referring to Zhang Xizhu, etc.), the government army was restrained by them, and the local militias feared their destruction... The bandits relied on them as a protective charm and a haven for fugitives, appearing and disappearing freely without any fear."

　　But the Manchu Qing court was not unaware of this situation. Only because its own "military strength was insufficient" did it instruct the Zhili Governor-General Liu Changyou to "temporarily restrain" Song Jingshi "to isolate the bandits (Zhang Xizhu, etc.) and relieve military pressure." It also instructed Tan Tingxiang to say: "Only prevention should be implied in the restraint." This was the attitude in February. In March and April, because Zhang Xizhu was killed in battle, and Yang Pengshan and Zhang Jintang (Xizhu's son) successively sacrificed, the Qing court instructed Senggelinqin to "devise a plan to lure Song Jingshi to the main camp, interrogate him, and execute him." However, Tan Tingxiang believed that the teaching army troops of Zhang Yuhuai, Yang Pengling, and others were still strong, and he still advocated "temporary restraint." At this time, Song Jingshi assisted the retreating troops of Zhang Xizhu and others, taking them into his camp to preserve revolutionary military strength. By the end of April, Zhang Yuhuai and others were either sacrificed or lured and captured, and the teaching army disintegrated. The Manchu Qing government's "restraint" policy towards Song Jingshi had become a thing of the past; there was no need for the Song Jingshi Black Flag Army to perfunctorily deal with the Manchu Qing army, and the two sides officially entered a state of military engagement.

　　In early May, Song Jingshi ordered Liu Houde to lead more than a thousand infantry and cavalry to station south of Linqing city, confronting the Qing Zhili Provincial Commander Hengling's troops across the Grand Canal, cutting off the traffic between Liulin Regiment and the Qing army. They also occupied more than a dozen villages south of Linqing, including Shangdian, Jinglin, Zhaike, Liguanzhuang, and Futou, and moved the troops originally stationed in Guantao and other places closer to Linqing, from Jiantomb of the Wei River to Weijiawan of the Grand Canal, stretching for more than a hundred miles, setting up checkpoints and patrols, and deploying defenses meticulously. Gangtun and Xiaoliuguanzhuang were connected to become the main base. In the villages of Tangyi, Shen County, Linqing, Guan County, and Liaocheng, flags were erected, troops were recruited, moats were dug, fortresses were built, grain and grass were stockpiled, troops were trained, and preparations were made to meet the battle.

　　After destroying Zhang Yuhuai's teaching army troops at the end of April, the Manchu Qing army entered Shandong one after another. Zhili Governor-General Liu Changyou supervised the "bandit suppression" affairs of Zhili, Shandong, and Henan provinces, specifically "suppressing" Song Jingshi. Hengling and others were placed under his command. Liu Changyou himself divided his troops into three routes, advancing from Guantao, Nanguantao, and Jiantomb of Linqing, attacking the southwest, northwest, and west of the Black Flag Army's main camp, Gangtun. He ordered Zhili Provincial Commander Hengling and the cavalry of Sasabu, Cheng Bao, etc. to cross the river from Linqing in two routes, east and west, to encircle and suppress, attacking the northeast and north. He also ordered Su Kejin, the wing commander of Senggelinqin, to specifically defend the north route. The east route ordered Shandong Surveillance Commissioner Hu Zhen, Caozhou Garrison General Baode, and the local militias of each state and county to block in Liaocheng and Tangyi. The south route took the Zhili Dashunguang Circuit Zhu Kai, Daming Garrison General Yi Mian'a, and Guan County Magistrate Sun Shanshu's militia as the first batch, and Shandong Judicial Commissioner Ding Baozhen's Chu Yong as the second batch, advancing from Guan County. They came to surround the Black Flag Army from all directions. But after a month of deployment, by early June, Liu Changyou still did not dare to speak lightly of war. On the fifth day, Ding Baozhen, following Liu's order, sent someone to persuade Song Jingshi: to retain 1,500 soldiers and submit a roster for inspection. He also wanted to implement a set of "appeasement" plans. But on the night of the sixth day, Song Jingshi ordered Liu Houde and Yang Dianyi to cross the Grand Canal twice to reply to him. Liu Changyou had no other choice, and only then did he divide his troops into three routes on the eighth day, advancing to Qingshui Town, Guan County, to attack Gangtun. This is what the local farmers praised as the Battle of Qingshui on June 8th. According to the farmers: Liu Changyou sent 17,000 people to attack Gangtun that day, and only eighteen soldiers were left in Gangtun to guard the main camp; at that time, there was a big flood, and Xu Laodiao, a farmer who was forced to be a guide, deliberately led them to the east gate, where the water was deep. He dived into Gangtun to report the news, and the eighteen soldiers all turned out of the embankment and blew the *bili* in the wheat fields as a feigned force. Liu Changyou's troops were still testing the depth of the water, and many people had already drowned. As soon as they heard the *bili*, they immediately retreated. But Song Jingshi received the news and returned in three routes, one route to meet the battle, and two routes to ambush. Liu Changyou fell into the ambush, and those newly recruited soldiers collapsed without fighting, "dragging their swords and guns, only caring about escaping, not daring to fight back. The Black Flag Army killed the government soldiers like cutting sorghum heads. Two of the three teams of government soldiers died, and corpses were all over the ground, making it impossible to see the road." "Marshal Song got two houses full of *taiqiang*s, and also got a lot of cannons, placed in Xiaoliuguanzhuang, for everyone to see freely." In this battle, Hengling of the Senggelinqin system "failed to arrive as scheduled," Liu Changyou swallowed his anger and dared not impeach him, and from then on he simply "dared not face the Black Flag."

　　On June 15th, Hengling again launched an attack on Gangtun. Hengling led the troops of Cheng Bao, Sasabu, Haiqun, Yiqian, Wang Zuochen, Jiang Guozhong, Yindengbu, Ge Kaitai, etc., with more than 5,000 infantry and cavalry, and agreed with Liu Changyou and Ding Baozhen, Baode, and the Liulin Regiment to advance at the same time. This time, Ding Baozhen, Baode, and the Liulin Regiment of the local system also returned Hengling a "failure to arrive as scheduled." Hengling was cut into two or three sections by the Black Flag Army on the way to Gangtun -- near Lierzhuang and Panzhuang. "The team was in chaos, no one commanded, and they ran back." The "2,500 people" personally led by Hengling were "all killed." He escaped all the way to "Linqing's chariot camp to save his life." The rest of the troops, except for Jiang Guozhong's troops who retreated first, also "lost a cannon." Needless to say, they were all defeated. This time, the Black Flag Army again "got a lot of bronze cannons." Hengling also "dared not go out to fight the Black Flag Army." Occasionally, when he came out, Song Jingshi would laugh and say: "Hengling is sending horses again."

　　Liu Changyou and Hengling both retreated to Linqing, leaving only Ding Baozhen of the Shandong local system to deal with the situation. Song Jingshi did not take Ding Baozhen seriously, only "teasing him back and forth, Ding Baozhen followed behind, but couldn't hit him." Song Jingshi concentrated his forces to attack Liulin and Fan Village at any time.

　　At the end of June, Liu Changyou asked Ding Baozhen and Baode to meet with Song Jingshi in Xinji. The result of the meeting was not disclosed, but there were two corroborating evidences. One was that at the time of the meeting, Song Jingshi took advantage of their unpreparedness and attacked Liulin Fan Village again: "Ambushing and killing sixty-nine people, burning all the attached houses." The other was that Senggelinqin later impeached them for this matter, and the Qing court issued an edict: "Liu Changyou is demoted three levels but remains in office, and Ding Baozhen and Baode are dismissed from office but remain in office." It can be seen that this meeting's conspiracy was another unsuccessful attempt. In July, Liu and Heng were trapped in Linqing, and Ding Baozhen hid under the protection of Liulin and Fan Village and dared not come forward. The Black Flag Army expanded its rear to Guan County and Shen County at this time, and broke into the territory of Chaocheng and Qingping counties. The number of farmers joining the Black Flag "increased." Because Song Jingshi ordered the landlords in the four prefectures and counties of Tangyi, Shen County, Guan County, and Liaocheng to divide half of the collected wheat and grain to the tenants, and half to the Black Flag Army, he gained the enthusiastic support of the farmers.

　　The Manchu Qing court panicked and sent the largest trump card -- Mongolian Korchin Prince Senggelinqin -- to Shandong, ordering Liu Changyou and below to be dispatched by him. On the first day of the eighth month of Tongzhi's second year, he arrived at Weijiawan in Qingping County and divided his troops to station at Liangjiaqian in Tangyi (ie, Liangshui Town), attacking the Black Flag from the southeast. He ordered Liu Changyou, who had been "stationed in Linqing" for more than a month and "sat with heavy troops, delaying and not advancing," to attack its northwest; he ordered Ding Baozhen and Baode to attack its south; he ordered the newly appointed Shandong Governor Yan Jingming to strictly guard the Wei River and the Grand Canal; Hengling, Su Kejin, Shutong'a, etc. were directly commanded by himself. Not to mention Liulin and Fan Village among the landlord armed forces, those "semi-private and semi-official" Xinji, Duigui, Xiaotun, and other groups all revealed their true colors and actively participated in this large "encirclement and suppression" that they thought they would win. Senggelinqin himself was even more stubborn and relied on his victory over Shandong. He thought that Song Jingshi was a group of "local rats," not worth leveling. He even said arrogantly: "The Black Boy is not enough to pad my horse's hooves!" But as soon as he fought, he "failed to win in successive battles," "the situation was almost unsustainable," and "the soldiers wanted to collapse several times!" Senggelinqin had to personally climb to the tile kiln in Xiwuzhuang, Liulin, to supervise the battle, and said: "If I can't level Song Jingshi, I will surrender to him!" But it still didn't work. Hengling was defeated and returned, Liu Changyou was also defeated and returned, and Su Kejin and Haiqun were also defeated and returned. According to the farmers: the generals "knelt on the ground and asked to borrow the Prince's flag. The Prince allowed them, and they carried the Prince's flag out to fight again." But the Black Flag Army said: "Prince! We are not afraid even if the Prince's grandmother comes!" The generals were defeated again. It is said: "The Prince was so angry that he even bit off his teeth." Then he ordered five battalions to attack together, but they were still suppressed by the Black Flag Army, and forty "square cities" were broken. Yang Dianyi - Yang Er Ma Jian, a general of the Black Flag, even directly killed the bottom of the kiln where Senggelinqin was supervising the battle. Haiqun was so scared that he knelt down and said:

　　"Please, Prince, mount your horse!" Seng angrily said: "I will die on this kiln!" In the end, it was Chen Guorui's five hundred Red Children's foreign gun team that saved him. Because the Black Flag Army had never encountered such a concentrated firepower, they said: "You can't see people, you will die if you don't agree!" They retreated from Gangtun to Xiaoliuguanzhuang. Senggelinqin's superior forces forced the Black Flag Army to retreat: "The Black Flag was attacked from a 15-mile-long line from Liguanzhuang to Buzhai and a 110-mile-long line from the Grand Canal to the Wei River," and then it retreated three miles. But Senggelinqin then ordered 1,500 people to dig trenches and release water outside the village, using the old method of encircling Li Kaifang, Taiping Army, to encircle Xiaoliuguanzhuang. Song Jingshi saw that the situation was critical, so he aimed at Senggelinqin's stubborn character and asked people to send him a war note, expressing his unwillingness to lose, and agreeing to fight him again tomorrow. Senggelinqin was indeed fooled and ordered to stop digging trenches; at the same time, he ordered flags to be planted all over the dike, the gongs and drums were non-stop, and quilts were placed on the ground. All the people in the village were evacuated with carts, and the Black Flag Army was also completely evacuated. The next day, Senggelinqin rushed into the empty Xiaoliuguanzhuang dike and saw only inverted sheep, sheep hooves drumming; old cattle pulling carts, carts with flags planted. Senggelinqin was furious and divided his troops to chase after him. Su Kejin and Cheng Bao and others chased all the way to Dachang in Chaocheng. The Black Flag Army had already ambushed here and was defeated and fled again. Cheng Bao was captured by the Black Flag Army.

　　The Black Flag Army successfully completed its retreat plan and changed the passive interior line operation into an active exterior line operation. From August 13th to 27th, the Black Flag Army traveled south from Guan County, passing through Shen County and Chaocheng, bypassing Fan County and Puzhou, traveling west into Qingfeng and Kaizhou of Zhili, entering Hua County and Jun County of Henan, traveling north to Linzhang and Neihuang, crossing the Zhang River and re-entering Cheng'an, Feixiang, Handan, Yongnian, Quyang, Jize, Pingxiang of Zhili, and then going north to Julu, Longping, Xinhe, Wuyi, Fucheng, Jiahe, and crossing the east of the Grand Canal from Xiakou south of Dongguang Botou, then going south to Wuqiao and Ningjin, entering Dezhou of Shandong, and returning to Xiajin and Gaotang. In half a month, he galloped across the vast plains of more than 30 counties in the border area of Zhili, Shandong, and Henan provinces, forcing the two armies of Senggelinqin and Liu Changyou to completely lose the initiative and only follow behind the Black Flag Army, which was "nowhere to be found," day and night. The Qing army was "unable to contact each other due to its weak momentum, and even information was often not communicated." But the Black Flag Army's detour was "directed." On August 28th, it was divided into two branches. Yang Dianyi led a branch to divide into several small teams east of the Grand Canal, bypassing the rear of the Qing army to "strike the west and flee east, intercept the south and flee north," making the Qing army unable to figure it out. Song Jingshi led an army across the Grand Canal from Kangzhuang (now Ping County), Daijiawan, avoiding the real and attacking the empty, detouring and suddenly returning to Tangyi, rushing towards the deeply hated enemy -- the Liulin Regiment. But what became the eternal regret of the Black Flag Army and Song Jingshi was that this time they still failed to open Liulin, and only killed eighty-eight landlords who fled to Liulin at Dasangshu. This is the Battle of Dasangshu, "killed eighty-eight on August 28th," which the farmers in Liulin and Gangtun areas relish.

　　On the first day of the ninth lunar month, Song Jingshi led his army to relieve the siege of Liulin, almost on the same route as the retreat from Xiaoliuguanzhuang, and again from Kaizhou, Zhili, via Henan to Zhili, and returned to Shandong. On the seventh and eighth day, he turned back to Kaizhou, crossed the Yellow River to the south, and arrived at Xiacai, Anhui in October, and temporarily cooperated with Miao Peilin, who finally "rebelled" against the Manchu Qing. When Song Jingshi crossed the Yellow River, it was generally said that he only had a single horse left, but when he broke through from Xiacai with Miao Tianqing on October 29th, it is said that there were a total of 3,000 people, among whom there may have been Song Jingshi's troops; and in the first month of the third year of Tongzhi, according to "Strategies for Suppressing the Nian Bandits" volume 210, "Miao (Peilin) rebellious remnants Miao Tianqing again gathered Song Jingshi's defeated bandits to try to flee to Xiaogan," which shows that a part of the Black Flag Army crossed the Yellow River with Song Jingshi. Soon, Song Jingshi joined forces with Liang Wang Zhang Zongyu's troops of the Nian Army in Hubei. In the first month of the fourth year of Tongzhi, the joint forces of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the Nian Army, led by Zun Wang Lai Wenguang, Liang Wang Zhang Zongyu, Lu Wang Ren Zhu, and Jing Wang Niu Luohong, defeated Senggelinqin at Lushan, Henan, and beheaded Hengling and others. Song Jingshi participated in this battle. In February, they forced Kaifeng, in March, they attacked Xinyang Prefecture, went north to Queshan, Suiping, and Yancheng, and attacked Fugou in the east. Song Jingshi "led about 2,000 horse bandits from Queshan, rushing in separate groups," "claiming to return to Tangyi to seek revenge from the Liulin Regiment." Under this "claim" camouflage, Song Jingshi led the joint forces of the Taiping and Nian armies from Henan to Shandong, bypassing Jiangsu and re-entering Shandong, luring Senggelinqin to pursue them all the way. On April 24th, Song Jingshi and the joint forces arrived at the Yellow River in Caozhou, Shandong, where they joined tens of thousands of local people's armed forces in Yuncheng, set up a net, and pretended to be defeated and crossed the river. Senggelinqin chased to Caozhou, how could he give up! He chased to the Yellow River, chased to Gaolouji, and the joint army of Taiping and Nian had already抄 to his back; Senggelinqin hurriedly retreated to Hao Hutong, but the joint army had surrounded him, unable to break through, and dug trenches and released water on all sides, wanting to trap him to death like he did to Li Kaifang in Fengguantun. Senggelinqin escaped at night and was killed by the joint army in the wheat field. Cabinet Scholar Quan Shun and General He Jian'ao were also killed in battle; Chen Guorui was also seriously injured; Seng's army was completely defeated, and the foreign gun team was completely killed; all supplies, weapons, and horses were captured. In this battle, Song Jingshi not only participated in the battle, but the farmers said that the one who killed Senggelinqin was Yang Dianyi, a general of Song Jingshi. "Returning to Tangyi to seek revenge from the Liulin Regiment" was just a propaganda offensive by Song Jingshi's Black Flag Army, but they really avenged their deadly enemy Senggelinqin.

　　V. The Life-and-Death Relationship Between the Black Flag Army and the People
　　and the Death of the Hero Song Jingshi

　　The Black Flag Army was the people's own army, so a life-and-death relationship was created between the army and the people. Until now, the broad masses of farmers still praise Song Jingshi and his Black Flag Army. Among the 719 elderly people we met and talked with, except for three or five who were born into landlords or merchants, their love and support for the Black Flag Army was indescribable. Even these three or five landlord and merchant elements, although they verbally scolded the Black Flag as "bandits," had to admit that its discipline was "good" when specifically talking about it, and had to admit that Song Jingshi was a "good person." Farmers naturally loved the Black Flag Army because it represented their interests and embodied their hopes. What the farmers directly hated were the landlords and yamen runners, and the Black Flag Army overthrew them. The Black Flag Army forced the landlords to pay more grain and grass, the rich peasants to pay less, and the poor farmers not only did not pay, but also "benefited from the Black Flag" by sharing the landlords' grain and property. If the farmers voluntarily sent something, the Black Flag Army would return something to them. The disabled were supported, and ordinary "people who came to the Black Flag could eat and drink freely for a month and a half." The people who came to the Black Flag from other places, "had food and drink here, and were given land to cultivate." In the later period, they even forced the landlords and tenants to divide the collected wheat and grain equally: half was given to the tenants, and the landlord's half was sent to the Black Flag Army camp. The land and grain of the reactionary and fugitive landlords were distributed to the poor farmers for cultivation and consumption. The Black Flag Army killed the yamen runners, especially those who collected money and grain, such as the so-called "yamen moths" who "digging up the measure". Even the yamen runners in areas outside the jurisdiction of the Black Flag Army, such as Linqing City, were often tied to the chariot camp by the Black Flag and killed.

　　The Black Flag had strict discipline: no extortion of people's property; no occupation of people's houses; no taking of women's clothing; no adultery, theft, or licentiousness. When walking and marching, they were absolutely not allowed to step on crops; when they went to a place, they only camped in the wilderness and did not enter villages; sometimes they were afraid of disturbing the people, so they detoured outside the villages; when they set up stoves to cook, they borrowed the pots sent by the people. If they did not borrow them, they used earthen pots to burn them, and were not allowed to enter the people's houses; anyone who made someone else's child cry would be punished; those who beat or scolded people would be punished; those who committed adultery were immediately executed. -- Especially those who committed adultery, the names of those who were executed are still remembered by the farmers. The Black Flag Army issued notices to reassure the people as soon as they arrived at a place, buying and selling publicly, not selling on credit and not taking anything. The farmers said: "Don't say you eat wheat, the Black Flag won't take your money." "They won't even destroy your image offering." Therefore, the people made a final judgment on the Black Flag Army: they said that Song Jingshi himself did not own a house or a piece of land during the revolution. Even though he was a marshal, his family still had those two broken houses; his general Wen Lianke advised Song during his heyday: "You have to build a grave!" Song Jingshi was very unhappy and said: "You are ruining me!" The farmers even said that not only Song Jingshi himself, but the entire Black Flag Army was like this. They affirmed:

　　"I have never heard of anyone getting rich when they joined the Black Flag!"

　　The people's assistance to the Black Flag Army was naturally meticulous: women patrolled for the Black Flag; children led horses for the Black Flag; the farmers welcomed the Black Flag when it came and saw it off when it left; "when the government soldiers chased the Black Flag, no one told the government soldiers where the Black Flag ran;" it was very common and universal for the farmers to raise dust to help the battle when facing the government soldiers; the fact that Xu Laodiao, a farmer selling vegetables in Gangtun, led Liu Changyou's army to the deep water was circulated among the farmers as a good story; there were also heroic actions like the one in Jazhen, which actively attacked the Qing army and helped the Black Flag, which was a good story between the army and the people: "The government soldiers lived in the town for twelve days and used jujube wood to insert two large camps to defend against the Black Flag. The people threw water ladles, buckets, and everything else into the only well in the town at night, clogging the well. Everyone, at the expense of having no water to drink, forced the government soldiers away."

　　Because the Black Flag Army and the people had established such a life-and-death relationship, when they retreated from Xiaoliuguanzhuang, they took all the people of the village with them. Also, because of this, the landlord class's slaughter and persecution of the Black Flag family members and ordinary farmers reached a frenzy.

　　"A Brief History of the Military Uprising in Shandong" admitted that the government soldiers and landlords slaughtered more than 2,000 farmers, but the farmers said that the Fan Village Regiment alone killed several thousand people. They went out every day to capture the Black Flag "remnants," bringing them back in strings, collectively beheading them in batches of fifty people. Outside the west gate of Fan Village, the corpses piled up into a mass grave. The dogs in Fan Village ate dead people and their eyes turned red. They even wanted to eat living people. For a long time, no one dared to pass through Fan Village in broad daylight. According to the farmers, this arrest "lasted for two years." -- The Manchu Qing's official gazettes proved that they were still arresting people more than ten years later. They were not only arresting the Black Flag, but "if one family was a Black Flag, eight families would suffer." Many villages were killed and no one was left. However, the Black Flag and the farmers did not succumb. Most of them heroically died generously. Not to mention generals like Liu Houde and Zhang Fenghai, Xu Sanhaha, who held the command flag for Song Jingshi, "had a smiling face and unchanged complexion" even when he was caught by Senggelinqin. When Sun Siyang'er was buried alive, he jumped into the pit and lay down, saying: "Bury me!" There were also many soldiers who understood the fate of their families before retreating. For example, General Xue Li killed his wife before leaving. He said: "If I don't kill her, they will kill her too." Gao Tongwu followed the Black Flag, "leaving behind his wife and ten-year-old daughter. His wife was afraid that the government soldiers would抓 her daughter and defile her, so she took her daughter to play by the pond. She turned around the pond with tears in her eyes all morning. Finally, when her daughter was not paying attention, she pushed her into the pond and drowned her. She also circled the pond for a long time." Such tragic examples are too numerous to mention. The landlord class shamelessly plundered the farmers' land and property: all the houses, furniture, livestock, and property in Gangtun and Xiaoliuguanzhuang completely belonged to Liulin and Fan Village. These two villages were razed to the ground. The houses were all demolished, and even the stone troughs, Luo beds, and even broken pieces of jars were robbed. People's ancestral images were also robbed to be hung as paintings. "Only three trees in front of the temple in Gangtun were not moved away." And it was not only these two villages that suffered such disasters. Dongxibuzhai, Qianmiaoshang, Yuezhuang, Meizhuang, Liangzhuang, Baimamiao in Shen County, Da Liwang, Yujia (village)... all have similar legends. The most brutal plunder was the confiscation of farmers' land. "Shandong Tongzhi" confessed that it confiscated "26 acres and 80 acres of 'rebel property' near Gangtun and Xiaoliuguanzhuang. Also, 62 acres and zero acres of 'rebel property' in various counties of Tangyi, Shen, Guan, Guan, and Chao." Adding the other counties, it was estimated to be about 100 acres. But this is much lower than the actual number. For example, Guan County alone confiscated "dozens of acres." -- This is still what the "Guan County County Annals" said; according to the farmers, when confiscating "bandit property land," all the families who "spoke to the Black Flag" and "touched a little moisture" were also confiscated under intimidation and extortion; the land connected to "bandit property land," no matter whose land it was, was measured and occupied at will if it was fancy, and no one dared to say anything. And these lands actually all belonged to the landlord class. -- Such as Xiaoliuguanzhuang's all belonged to Liulin Regiment, and Gangtun's all belonged to Fan Village Regiment. As a result, tens of thousands of self-cultivating poor peasants suddenly became tenants. The farmers' land ownership became the landlords', and they turned around and rented their own land from the landlords to cultivate. In addition to paying the inherent money and grain for renting this "bandit property land," they also had to pay "bandit property grain" -- each acre of land was equal to paying the grain for three acres of land. The farmers dared not cultivate this land, "but they had to cultivate it to live." There were also some farmers whose land was occupied, but "they had to pay grain even if they had no land," "many people were so anxious that they hanged themselves." Finally, the landlords sold these confiscated lands back to the farmers, and they were not finished selling them until 1930! The hatred of the farmers in Gangtun and Xiaoliuguanzhuang for the landlord class in Liulin and Fan Village has continued for nearly a hundred years and has not been eliminated. Not long ago, the people of Xiaoliuguanzhuang would not go to the market in Liulin, and the people of Gangtun would not marry the people of Fan Village. -- Although this class hatred has been formally changed by the landlord class into regional hatred.

　　But the hatred of the farmers in western Shandong is mainly manifested in the continuous revolutionary actions that followed. After Xiaoliuguanzhuang was evacuated, many Black Flag Army members still lurked in nearby counties. The activities of the farmer armed forces, known as Song Jingshi's "remnants," never stopped after the second year of Tongzhi. In the battle to annihilate Senggelinqin in the fourth year of Tongzhi, the "remnants" in the Dongchang area had supported them. When Zhang Zongyu's troops arrived in the Dongchang area in the seventh year of Tongzhi, the local farmer armed forces were once again active. Continuing until the twenty-fifth year of Guangxu (1899 AD), the Shandong farmers launched the Boxer Movement under the leadership of the White Lotus Sect. Song Jingshi happened to return to Gangtun in the twenty-sixth year of Guangxu (1900 AD) with the intention of participating in and leading this movement. However, Yuxian, who used the Boxer Rebellion to exclude foreigners, was transferred to Shanxi, and Yuan Shikai, the newly appointed governor of Shandong, spared no effort in suppressing the Boxer Rebellion. Song Jingshi seemed to have failed to achieve his goals, and soon left Shandong again.

　　After Zhang Zongyu retreated in the seventh year of Tongzhi and drowned himself in the Tuhai River, no one knew where Song Jingshi had gone. The Manchu Qing court was very uneasy and repeatedly asked about his whereabouts but could not find him. It was not until the tenth year of Tongzhi that Ying Han, the governor of Anhui -- a master of false credit -- caught a Xu Liansheng in Bozhou who was curing diseases by drawing magic water, and insisted that he was Song Jingshi's pseudonym, and reported to the Qing court. An imperial decree was issued to kill him in the capital of Anhui Province and order him to "transmit his head to the place where the incident occurred" for public display. However, none of the more than 700 farmers we talked to admitted that Song Jingshi was dead. (Of course, it is not to say that he is not dead now) Even the descendants of the Liulin landlords did not say that Song Jingshi's head had been transmitted to Dongchang or Tangyi for public display. The farmers in the Gangtun area firmly said that Song Jingshi had returned in the twenty-sixth year of Guangxu. Among them, Yang Shoude also said that he had seen him with his own eyes. At that time, he was 75 or 76 years old and lived in the home of Wen Lianke, a general of the Black Flag. Wen Lianke's son, Wen Bingcheng, still had concerns about this matter. Although he denied that Song Jingshi lived in his father's house, saying that his father had died in the twenty-sixth year of Guangxu, he affirmed that Song Jingshi had returned to Gangtun and inquired about his father's affairs, and he also described Song Jingshi's appearance and personality at that time. Therefore, Xu Liansheng, who was killed in Anhui in the tenth year of Tongzhi, was just a tool for Ying Han to take credit for. Xu Jizhi of Gangtun said well about this matter: "Song Jingshi is not dead, and the Manchu Qing court killed a person and said that Song Jingshi had been brought to justice. -- They felt at ease in their hearts when they thought Song Jingshi was dead." He completely exposed the cowardly psychology of the Manchu Qing court.

　　The general legend is that Song Jingshi returned to Gangtun because there was a flood that year, and Song Jingshi directed the farmers to dig up the buried silver in the dry well to help the people, but the gold and silver had been stolen, so Song Jingshi left quietly. However, the old people in Qiaozhuang said that he had returned to run a "regiment," and Li Jingci's article "Some Events and Legends about Song Jingshi" also said that he "later served as the master of the senior brothers of the Boxers." His claim to have returned to dig up buried silver to help the people was just a cover-up after disappointment. But in any case, Song Jingshi, at the age of seventy-seven, never forgot the suffering of the people and never forgot the farmers' revolutionary movement!

　　Song Jingshi was born in 1824, and he is 129 years old this year. Of course, he is no longer in the world. But the farmers only spread rumors about his later years being in Shaanxi, or in Shanxi, or

    农民革命英雄宋景诗及其黑旗军
    ——“宋景诗历史调查报告”提要
    陈白尘（续昨）
    宋景诗黑旗军在同治二年正月底和地主武装展开战斗；而和满清政府军队进入战斗状态，则是从这年的五月起才开始的。在二月初到四月底，黑旗军对满清军队所取态度是地主阶级所谓的“半私半官”：他们驻扎在馆陶、堂邑一带，“来去自由”，清军不敢干涉。“仅未显与官军对垒耳。”而把力量全部用在对付地主武装上。而所以这样做，似乎是与张锡珠、张玉怀等取得联系合作的一种分工。因为黑旗军看住了以柳林、范寨为主的地主武装，张锡珠等便可以转动自如地对付满清政府的部队。这就是满清山东道监察御史王兰谷奏折所说的：“竟与贼（按指张锡珠等）为犄角之势，官军受其牵掣，民团畏其倾害，……贼遂恃为护身符、逋逃薮，出没自如，毫无所忌。”
    但满清朝廷并非不了解这种情况。只因自己“兵力未足”，所以指示直隶总督刘长佑对宋景诗：“仍暂为羁绁，以孤贼（张锡珠等）势而纾兵力。”对谭廷襄也指示说：“止可于羁靡之中寓防范之意。”这是二月间的态度。到了三、四月间，因为张锡珠阵亡，杨朋山、张金堂（锡珠子）先后牺牲，清廷便指示僧格林沁要：“将宋景诗设计调至大营，讯明正法”了。但谭廷襄则以为张玉怀、杨朋岭等教军部队力量尚在，还主张“暂事羁靡”。宋景诗则在此时协助张锡珠等败退的部队，收留在自己营中，以保存革命军事力量。到四月底，张玉怀等也都或牺牲或被诱擒，教军瓦解。满清政府对宋景诗的“羁靡”政策已成过去；宋景诗黑旗军对满清军队敷衍政策也无必要，双方便正式进入军事状态。
    五月初，宋景诗令刘厚德引马步千余人驻临清城南，与清直隶提督恒龄军队隔运河对峙，隔绝了柳林团与清军的交通。并占领临清之南尚店、荆林、翟科、李官庄、幞头等十数村庄，又把原住馆陶等处部队移近临清，自卫河之尖冢，至运河之魏家湾，绵亘百余里，设卡巡警，严密布防。而以岗屯和小刘贯庄连接起来成为大本营。在堂邑、莘县、临清、冠县、聊城各村庄竖立旗号，招集人马，挖濠筑寨，囤积粮草，训练部队，准备迎战了。
    满清军队从四月底消灭了张玉怀等教军部队以后，便纷纷进入山东。以直隶总督刘长佑督办直、鲁、豫三省“剿匪”事宜，专“剿”宋景诗。而以恒龄等交给他指挥。刘长佑自己兵分三路，由馆陶、南馆陶、临清尖冢三处进兵，攻黑旗军大本营岗屯之西南、西北及正西三路。令直隶提督恒龄及萨萨布、成保等马队由临清分东西两路渡河包剿，攻东北及正北。并令僧格林沁的翼长苏克金专防北路。东路则令山东按察司呼震及曹州镇总兵保德及各州县民团在聊城、堂邑防堵。南路则以直隶大顺广道祝垲、大名镇总兵伊绵阿及冠县知县孙善述所率民团为第一批，山东臬司丁宝桢的楚勇为第二批由冠县进军。从四面八方来包围黑旗军。但经过一个月的布置，到六月初，刘长佑还是不敢轻于言战。初五日，丁宝桢遵刘之命派人劝说宋景诗：要他保留兵勇一千五百人，造名册候点验。又想来一套“招抚”之计。但初六日夜宋景诗便命刘厚德、杨殿乙两度抢渡运河来答复他。刘长佑无计可施，这才在初八日分三路进兵至冠县清水镇，向岗屯进攻。这就是当地农民们所艳称的六月初八的清水之战。据农民们说：刘长佑这天派了一万七千人来攻岗屯，岗屯里只剩下一十八名战士看守大营；当时正发大水，被迫做向导的农民许老刁故意引他们到水深之处的东门，他一个濛子凫进岗屯报信，十八个战士都翻出圩子伏在麦田中吹起筚篥来作为疑兵。刘长佑的人马还在试水的深浅，已经被淹死许多人了，一听筚篥，马上退兵。但宋景诗得了信已分三路回来，一路迎战，两路埋伏。刘长佑中了埋伏，那些新募的兵勇不战而溃，“拖着刀枪，只顾逃命，不敢还手。黑旗军杀官军像割高粱头一样。三队官兵死了两队，死人遍地，看不见道儿。”“宋大帅得了装满两屋子的抬枪，还得了好多大炮，放在小刘贯庄，叫大家随便看。”这一次作战，僧格林沁系统的恒龄“期会不至”，刘长佑忍气吞声，不敢参奏，从此只有“简直不敢朝黑旗的面儿了。”
    六月十五日，又以恒龄为主向岗屯进攻了一次。恒龄率领成保、萨萨布、海群、益谦、王佐臣、姜国仲、音登布、葛开泰等部马步五千余人，并约会刘长佑及丁宝桢、保德和柳林团等同时进兵。这次地方系统的丁宝桢、保德以及柳林团也同样回敬了恒龄一个“期会不至”，恒龄在向岗屯进军的半路上——黎儿庄、潘庄一带就被黑旗军杀成两截儿。或者三截儿，“队伍乱了，没人指挥，就向回跑”。恒龄自己亲率的“二千五百人，都被杀光。”一直逃到“临清的车营，才保住性命。”其余人马除了姜国仲部先退了，还“遗失炸炮一尊”，别的不用说，都被打垮了。黑旗军这次又“得了好些铜炮。”而恒龄从此也“不敢出去打黑旗军了。”偶一出阵，宋景诗便笑道：“恒龄又送马来了。”
    刘长佑和恒龄都退到临清，只剩下一个山东地方系统的丁宝桢在敷衍局面。而宋景诗对于丁宝桢更是不放在眼内，只跟他“来回闹腾转湾，丁宝桢跟在后面，可打不了他。”而宋景诗则集中力量随时去攻打柳林，范寨。
    到了六月末，刘长佑又让丁宝桢与保德出面在辛集与宋景诗会见。会见的结果不传，但有两个旁证，一是就在会见之时，宋景诗乘其不备，又攻袭柳林范寨：“掩杀六十九人，尽焚附圩屋室。”一是后来僧格林沁因此事参了一本，清廷便谕：“刘长佑降三级留任，丁宝桢、保德革职留任。”可见这次会见阴谋又是画虎不成的了。七月一个月里，刘、恒二人坐困临清，丁宝桢则躲在柳林、范寨的保护之下不敢出头。黑旗军便在此时扩大其后方到冠县、莘县，并突入朝城、清平县境。而参加黑旗的农民“人数益众。”因为宋景诗在堂邑、莘县、冠县、聊城四州县，勒令地主把所收麦谷一半分给佃户，一半送给黑旗军，更获得了农民的热烈拥护。
    满清朝廷慌了手脚，这才派遣那最大一张王牌——蒙古科尔沁亲王僧格林沁来到山东，令刘长佑以下均归其调遣。同治二年八月初一他到达清平县魏家湾，分军驻扎堂邑梁家浅。（即梁水镇）由东南方进攻黑旗，而令“月余之久，仍扎临清”，“坐拥重兵，迁延不进”的刘长佑攻其西北；令丁宝桢保德等攻其南；令新任山东巡抚阎敬铭严防卫河与运河；恒龄、苏克金、舒通阿等则归其自己直接指挥。地主武装中柳林、范寨不用说，那些“半私半官”的辛集、堆堌、小屯等团也都露出本来面目，积极地来参预这次自以为必操胜算的大“围剿”了。僧格林沁本人更是刚愎自用，恃其在山东百胜之威，认为宋景诗是群“土耗子”，不足平。并说大话：“黑小子还不够垫我马蹄子的！”但一交手，便“连战不克”，“势几不支”，“兵欲溃者数矣！”僧格林沁只得亲自爬到柳林西武庄的瓦窑上去督战，并说：“我要平不了宋景诗，我投降他！”但依然不中用。恒龄败回来了，刘长佑也败回来了，苏克金、海群也败回来了。据农民们说：大将们“跪在地下请借王爷的大旗用一用，王爷许可了他们，扛着王爷大旗又出战。”但黑旗军却说：“王爷！王奶奶来了也不怕！”大将们又败下来了。据说：“王爷气得连牙都咬下来了。”然后命令五营齐上，但依然被黑旗军压了下来，四十个“方城子”都被打破了。黑旗大将杨殿乙——杨二马鞯并且直杀到僧格林沁督战的窑根底下。吓得海群跪下说：
    “请王爷升马吧！”僧气急地说：“我就死在这窑上吧！”最后，是陈国瑞的五百红孩儿洋枪队救了他。因为黑旗军从没遇见过这样多集中的火力，说：“看不见人影，不对头就死人！”并且从岗屯撤退到小刘贯庄。僧格林沁的优势兵力逼使黑旗军不能不撤退：“由李官庄到布寨纵长十五里，由运河到卫河横长百十里地的战线来打黑旗”，这才往后撤了三里地。但僧格林沁接着命令一千五百人在庄外挖壕放水，用围困太平军李开芳的老办法来围困小刘贯庄。宋景诗看到形势危急，他这才一面针对僧格林沁刚愎的性格，叫人给他下战表，表示不服输，约他明日再战，僧格林沁果然中计，命令停止挖壕；同时一面叫圩子上遍插旌旗，锣鼓不停，将棉被垫在地上，用大车把全村的老百姓都撤走了，黑旗军也全撤退了。第二天僧格林沁扑进小刘贯庄空圩子，只见倒悬绵羊，羊蹄击鼓；老牛?车，车插旌旗。僧格林沁暴怒之下，分兵穷追。苏克金和成保等一路追至朝城大场，黑旗军早在此埋伏下了，又被杀得大败而逃，成保并被黑旗军所俘。
    黑旗军撤退计划胜利完成，便改变了被动的内线作战为主动的外线作战。八月十三日起至二十七日，黑旗军由冠县向南疾行，经莘县、朝城，绕范县、濮州，西行入直隶之清丰、开州，进入河南之滑县、浚县，北走临漳、内黄，渡漳河再入直隶之成安、肥乡、邯郸、永年、曲周、鸡泽、平乡，再北上巨鹿、隆平、新河、武邑、阜城、交河，由东光泊头以南之霞口渡运河之东，再南走吴桥、宁津，入山东德州，回至夏津、高唐。半月之间，驰骋于直、鲁、豫三省交界地区三十余县之广大平原上，逼得僧格林沁和刘长佑两军完全失去主动，只有跟在“迄无定向”的黑旗军后面日夜穷追。使得清军“微持声势难于联络，即信息多不得通。”但黑旗军绕了这样一个大圈子是有“定向”的，它到八月二十八日，分为两枝，杨殿乙率领一枝在运河之东分成若干小队，绕至清军后路“东击西逝，南截北逃。”使得清军无从捉摸。而宋景诗自率的一军则由康庄（今平县城），戴家湾渡过运河，避实就虚，绕道而行，突然回到堂邑，猛扑那仇深似海的敌人——柳林团。但成为黑旗军和宋景诗千古遗恨的，是这一次依然没有打开柳林，只在大桑树杀了八十八个向柳林逃难的地主。这就是柳林、岗屯一带农民津津乐道的“八月二十八，杀了八十八”的大桑树之役。
    阴九月初一日，宋景诗率军由柳林解围去，几乎和小刘贯庄撤退的路线相同，又从直隶开州，经河南再入直隶，重回山东，初七、八折回开州，渡黄河而南，于十月间到达安徽下蔡，与最后终于“叛”了满清的苗沛霖暂时合作。当宋景诗渡黄河时一般都说他只剩下单人匹马了，但他在十月二十九日与苗天庆一同由下蔡突围时，据说共有三千人，其中已经可能有宋景诗的部队在内；而同治三年正月，据“剿平捻匪方略”卷二百十说：“苗（沛霖）逆余党苗添罄（天庆）复有纠合宋景诗溃匪图窜孝感之信”，更可见黑旗军是有一部分和宋景诗一同渡过黄河了。不久，宋景诗便在湖北和捻军梁王张宗禹部会合。同治四年正月，太平天国与捻军联合部队遵王赖文光、梁王张宗禹、鲁王任柱、荆王牛洛红等先败僧格林沁于河南鲁山，斩恒龄等。宋景诗便参与了这一战斗。二月逼开封，三月攻信阳州，北走确山、遂平、郾城，东攻扶沟。宋景诗便“由确山带领马贼约二千人，分股疾趋，”“声言欲回堂邑与柳林团寻仇。”就在这“声言”掩饰之下，宋景诗便引导着太平与捻联合大军由河南入山东，绕由江苏再入山东，诱得僧格林沁在后面一味穷追。四月二十四日，宋景诗与联合大军到了山东曹州黄河边上，在这儿联合了郓城地方人民武装共数十万人，设下天罗地网，而佯装着败退渡河模样。僧格林沁追到曹州，那肯罢休！便向黄河边上追去，追到高楼集，太平与捻的联合军已经抄到他的背后了；僧格林沁急忙撤退到郝胡同，联军已经将他团团围住，突围不得了，并在四面挖壕放水，像他在冯官屯围困李开芳那样地想困死他。僧格林沁乘夜逃走，遂被联军杀死在麦田里。内阁学士全顺、总兵何建鳌也被阵斩；陈国瑞也受重伤；僧部大军溃散殆尽，洋枪队更被全部杀光；所有辎重、武器、马匹，均被俘获。这一仗宋景诗不仅参与其役，而农民们说，杀死僧格林沁的便是宋景诗的大将杨殿乙。“回堂邑与柳林团寻仇”，不过是宋景诗黑旗军的宣传攻势，而对黑旗军的生死仇人僧格林沁可真算报了仇了。
    五、黑旗军与人民的生死关系
    及英雄宋景诗之死
    黑旗军是农民自己的军队，因此军民之间造成了生死与共的关系。直到现在，广大农民群众对宋景诗及其黑旗军依然是交口赞誉的。与我们见面谈话的七百十九位老人当中，除了三五个地主、商人出身的以外，他们对黑旗军所表示的热爱与拥护，是难以形容的。就连这三五个地主、商人分子，口中虽骂黑旗为“贼”，但具体地谈到它的纪律，也不得不承认是“好”，对宋景诗更不得不承认是个“好人”。农民之热爱黑旗军，自然是因为黑旗军代表了他们的利益，体现了他们的希望。农民所直接仇恨的是地主与衙役，黑旗军便打倒他们。黑旗军强迫地主多纳粮草，富农少纳，而贫苦农民不独不纳，并且要“沾黑旗的光”分得地主的粮食和财物。农民如果自愿地送些什么来，黑旗军照样送还他些什么。对残废的加以供养，普通“老百姓有到黑旗来的，一月半月也随便吃喝。”别处来投黑旗的百姓，“到这儿有吃有喝，一样给他地种。”在后期，更强迫地主与佃农平分所收麦谷：一半分给佃户，地主的一半则送到黑旗军营。对反动及逃亡地主的土地与粮食则分给贫苦农民耕种、食用。黑旗军对于衙役，特别是收钱粮的，如“挖升子”之类的所谓“衙蠹”，是抓到就杀。连黑旗军政权所及以外的地区如临清城内的衙役，也时常被黑旗绑到车营来杀了。
    黑旗有严格的纪律：不许敲诈民财；不许占住民宅；不许拿妇女衣裳；不许奸盗邪淫。走路行军绝对不踩庄稼；到一个地方只在漫野里扎营，不进村庄；有时怕惊扰百姓，都绕从村子外边走；埋锅造饭了，老百姓送锅子来就借用，不借就使瓦盆烧，不得进入民宅；有谁逗得人家孩子哭了要受罚；打人骂人要受罚；奸淫妇女更是立即正法。——特别是犯了奸淫罪的，那些被正法的人的姓名农民们至今都还举得出来。黑旗军到一处都先出告示安民，公买公卖，不赊不拿，农民说：“别说你家吃麦子，就是吃银子黑旗也不拿你的。”“连供像都不毁你的。”因此人民群众为黑旗军下了定评：他们说宋景诗自己在革命当中没有置过一房一地，他做了大帅，家中还是那两间破房子；他的大将温连科在全盛时劝宋说：“你得修坟立墓啊！”宋景诗大不高兴说：“你这是糟踏我！”农民们更说，不仅宋景诗个人，整个黑旗军都是如此的。他们肯定地说：
    “没听说过谁当了黑旗发了财的！”
    人民群众对于黑旗军的协助自然是无微不至了：妇女们为黑旗巡风；小孩子为黑旗溜马；黑旗来了农民们迎接，走了欢送；“官兵追黑旗的时候，没有一个老百姓告诉官军说黑旗往那里跑的；”与官军对阵时，农民们扬土助阵已经是很平常而普遍的事情了；像岗屯卖菜农民许老刁那样把刘长佑军队引到水深处去的事才在农民中间作为美谈流传着；还有像在贾镇的那种积极打击清军、帮助黑旗的英勇行动，也是军民之间的佳话：“官兵在镇上住了十二天，用枣木插了两道大营挡御黑旗。老百姓在黑夜里纷纷把水瓢、水桶什么的都丢进全镇独一的水井里，把井塞了。大家拚着没有水喝，就把官兵逼走了。”
    正因为黑旗军和人民结下了这样的生死关系，所以当从小刘贯庄撤退时，便把全庄的百姓都带走了。也正因为这样，地主阶级对于不曾撤走的黑旗家属以及一般农民的屠杀和迫害达到疯狂的程度。
    “山东军兴纪略”自认官兵和地主所屠杀的农民二千余人，但农民们说，仅仅范寨团就杀了几千人。他们每天出去捉拿黑旗“余党”，一串串捉回来，五十人一批地集体斩首，范寨西门外死尸堆成了万人坑。范寨的狗吃死人吃红了眼，连活人都要吃，很久时间大白天里都没人敢从范寨过。而这样地捉拿据农民说：“一直捉了两年”，——满清的邸报则证明到十几年以后还在捉。他们不仅是捉黑旗，而是“一家当黑旗，八家遭殃。”好多村子被杀得没人了。然而黑旗和农民并没有屈服，他们大多数都是英勇地慷慨就义，如刘厚德、张逢海等大将不用说，为宋景诗抱大令的许三哈哈被捉到僧格林沁面前都“满脸是笑，面色不改。”孙四羊儿被活埋时，自己跳进坑去躺下来，说：“你们埋吧！”还有许多将士在撤退之前就了解了家属的命运，比如大将薛礼，临走前杀了自己的妻子，他说：“我不杀她，也得叫人家杀了。”高桐五跟黑旗走了，“留下妻子和十岁的女儿。他妻子怕官兵把她女儿抓去糟踏，便带着女儿到水塘边去玩儿，她含着泪，在水塘边转了一上午，末了，当她女儿不留神时，一把推到塘里淹死了。她还绕着水塘转了半天。”而这类悲壮的例子是举不胜举的。地主阶级对于农民的土地财产，更是无耻地加以掠夺：岗屯和小刘贯庄全部房屋、家具、牲口、财物完全归柳林和范寨，这两个庄子被夷为平地，房屋都被拆光，连石槽、罗床甚至缸碴子都抢走了，人家的祖像也都抢去当画儿挂，“岗屯只剩下庙子前三棵树没搬走”了。而遭这样灾害的，并不只这两个村庄，东西布砦、前庙上、岳庄、梅庄、梁庄、莘县的白马庙、大李王、于家（村）……都有类似的传说。而最残暴的掠夺，则是没收农民的土地。“山东通志”招认说没收了“岗屯、小刘贯庄附近‘逆产’二十六顷八十亩。又堂邑、莘、冠、馆、朝各县‘逆产’六十二顷零。”再加其它县境的约计百顷。但这是远低于实际数字的，比如冠县一县就查抄了“数十顷”。——这还是“冠县县志”说的；根据农民们说，在没收“贼产地”的时候，凡是“跟黑旗说过话的”，“沾上点潮气的”的人家也在恐吓讹诈之下同样被没收了；和“贼产地”连界的土地，也不管是谁家的，被看中了也就丈量进去，随便霸占，谁也不敢吭声。而这些土地实际上全归了地主阶级。——如小刘贯庄的全归柳林团，岗屯的全归了范寨团。于是几万家自耕的贫农顿然变成了佃农。农民们的土地所有权变成地主的了，转回头再向地主租自己的地种。而租种这种“贼产地”的除了缴纳固有的钱粮以外，还要缴“贼产粮”，——每亩地等于完三亩地的粮。农民们不敢种这种地，“但为了活，又非种不可。”还有些农民，土地被霸占了，但“没有地也得完粮”，“好多人急得上了吊。”最后，地主们又把这些没收去的土地卖还给农民，一直到一九三○年还没卖完！而岗屯和小刘贯庄的农民对于柳林、范寨地主阶级的仇恨也延续了近百年都没有消灭。不久以前，小刘贯庄的人都还不到柳林赶集，岗屯的人也不跟范寨的人通婚。——虽然这阶级仇恨已被地主阶级在形式上改变成了地区间的仇恨。
    但鲁西农民们的仇恨，主要地则表现在以后连续不断的革命行动里。小刘贯庄撤走以后，许多黑旗军依然潜伏在附近各县。被称为宋景诗“余党”的农民武装活动，从同治二年以后，就没有断绝过。同治四年歼灭僧格林沁之役，东昌一带的“余党”就曾加以策应。同治七年张宗禹部队到达东昌地区，这里的农民武装又一度活跃。一直延续到光绪二十五年（公元一八九九年）山东农民便在白莲教领导之下爆发了义和团运动。而冠县正是义和团发祥地之一。宋景诗恰巧也在光绪二十六年（公元一九○○年）回到岗屯，有着前来参与领导这一运动的意图。但此时利用义和团来排外的毓贤调去山西，山东新任巡抚袁世凯对义和团镇压不遗余力，宋景诗似乎未能得志，不久就又远离山东了。
    宋景诗在同治七年张宗禹败退徒骇河投水自尽以后，谁也不知道他的去向。满清朝廷极不放心，一再追问他的下落而不可得。到了同治十年，安徽巡抚英翰——一位冒功的能手——才在亳州捉了一个为人符水治病的许连升，硬说是宋景诗所化名的，报奏清廷，奉旨在安徽省城杀了，并令“传首肇事地点”示众。但和我们谈话的七百多农民没有一个人承认宋景诗是死了的。（当然不是说现在还没死）连柳林地主的后代也没人说过宋景诗的首级曾被传到东昌或堂邑来示过众。而岗屯一带的农民则坚决地说光绪二十六年宋景诗回来过。其中像杨守德并说亲眼看见过他，当时他有七十五、六岁了，住在黑旗大将温连科的家里。而温连科的儿子温丙承对这件事还有顾虑，他虽然否认宋景诗住在他的父亲家里，说他父亲在光绪二十六年已经死了，但宋景诗回到过岗屯并且打听过他父亲的事他是肯定地加以证明的，他并且还描绘了宋景诗当时的外形和性格。因此同治十年在安徽被杀的许连升，不过是英翰冒功的工具而已。岗屯的许继之对这件事说得好：“宋景诗没有死，满清朝廷杀了一个人，就说宋景诗伏法了。——认为宋景诗死了，他们心里就踏实了。”完全戳穿满清朝廷的卑怯心理。
    宋景诗回到岗屯来，一般的传说是因为那年水灾，宋景诗指点农民挖掘枯井的藏银来救济百姓，但金银已被人盗走，宋景诗便飘然而去了。但乔庄的老人则说他回来办过“团”，李静慈同志的“关于宋景诗二三纪事和传说”一文里也说他“后来还当过义和团大师兄们的师父。”他之回来挖掘藏银救济百姓之说不过是失望后的掩饰之词罢了。但不管怎样，七十七岁高龄的宋景诗是始终没有忘怀人民的苦难，没有忘怀农民的革命运动的！
    宋景诗生于一八二四年，到今年是一百二十九岁了，当然早已不在人间。但农民们对于他的晚年只传说他还在陕西，或者还在山西，甚至说在蒙古，在关外、在南边，但都没有说到他的死。因此英雄宋景诗之死和许多历史上人民英雄的下落一样，成为一个谜了。但这个谜的本身也是真实的，因为英雄宋景诗在鲁西广大农民的心中是没有死的！（完）
