Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd. TASS Moscow, 1st:

    Borovsky published an article in "Pravda" entitled "American Soldiers in Korea Prepare a New Gamble." Borovsky wrote: People all over the world resolutely demand that the American imperialists end their criminal war against the Korean people for the past two years, in which they massacred peaceful residents and destroyed towns and villages. However, American diplomats are trying to cover up their aggressive actions, describing the American troops who killed civilians in Korea as "peace makers," and the Koreans who were killed as "aggressors." On the one hand, U.S. General Clark sabotages the Panmunjom peace talks, and on the other hand, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson delivers hypocritical speeches at the United Nations General Assembly, saying that the U.S. government is very keen to establish peace in Korea. However, Acheson's State Department and the U.S. Department of Defense apparently cannot reach an understanding on the issue of a unified tactic. Therefore, the day after Acheson delivered his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, the "New York Times" published a conversation with General Van Fleet, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army invading Korea, which completely disrupted the diplomatic situation created by Acheson.
    General Van Fleet spoke of expanding the Korean War and defeating the Chinese army. But Van Fleet is not the only one advocating for expanding the Korean War plan, these plans are supported by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. According to the "New York Times," Van Fleet and other senior officials admitted that the new offensive would cause huge casualties. They shamelessly said that the public should be mentally prepared for this huge loss of manpower. The "New York Times" said that there are now plans to mobilize the British, Canadians, Greeks, Turks, South Koreans... and the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang hiding in Taiwan. At the same time, the newspaper also admitted that the American invaders are forcing the South Koreans to fight by force.
    Borovsky concluded by saying: From this, it can be seen that the American invaders are using the false language of "peace-loving" as a guise to prepare a new gamble to expand the war of aggression against Korea.

    “真理报”发表专文
    论侵朝美军新的赌博
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社莫斯科一日讯：波罗夫斯基在“真理报”撰文，题为“美国军人在朝鲜准备新的赌博”。波罗夫斯基写道：全世界人民坚决地要求美帝国主义者结束他们两年来向朝鲜人民所进行的罪恶战争，他们屠杀了和平居民，毁灭了城镇和乡村。但是，美国外交官企图掩饰他们的侵略行动，他们把这件事情说成这样：在朝鲜杀害平民的美国军队是“和平制造者”，而被杀的朝鲜人是“侵略者”。一方面，美国克拉克将军破坏板门店和平谈判，另一方面，美国国务卿艾奇逊在联合国大会上发表伪善的演说，说什么美国政府极力希望在朝鲜建立和平。不过，艾奇逊的国务院与美国国防部之间对于共同一致的战术问题显然不能获得一个谅解。因此，艾奇逊在联合国大会发表演说后的第二天，“纽约时报”就登载了侵朝美国第八军军长范佛里特的一篇谈话，这篇谈话使艾奇逊一手所造成的外交局面全部紊乱了。
    范佛里特将军谈到要扩大朝鲜战争，击败中国军队。但是主张扩大朝鲜战争计划的并不是范佛里特一个人，这些计划是得到参谋长联席会议支持的。据“纽约时报”说，范佛里特及其他高级官员都承认新的攻势将造成巨大的人力损失。他们无耻地说，公众对于这个巨大人力损失应作思想上的准备。“纽约时报”说，现在已有计划动员英国人、加拿大人、希腊人、土耳其人、南朝鲜人……以及躲在台湾的蒋介石匪帮残余。同时，这张报纸也承认：美国侵略者是用武力迫使南朝鲜人作战的。
    波罗夫斯基最后结语说：由此可知，美国侵略者正以假的“爱好和平”的语言作幌子，来准备新的赌博以扩大侵朝战争。
