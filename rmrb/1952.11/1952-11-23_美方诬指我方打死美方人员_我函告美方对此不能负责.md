Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 22nd: On November 14th, the U.S. side's delegation to the Korean armistice talks sent a letter to our side's chief liaison officer, claiming that two days earlier, on November 12th, one of their personnel was killed by a bullet of a type used by our forces in the restricted area on both sides of the Panmunjom-Munsan highway. On the same day, the liaison officers of both sides conducted a joint investigation. The only material evidence presented by the other side was a bullet and a small hole in a tent allegedly penetrated by the bullet. The other side neither produced the body of the so-called person killed nor presented any evidence sufficient to prove that anyone was actually killed there. Furthermore, there were no bloodstains inside the tent at the location the other side claimed the incident occurred. When our liaison officer requested to determine the direction and height of the trajectory line between the so-called incident location and the small hole in the tent, the other side unreasonably obstructed and restricted the scope of the investigation. Our liaison officer pointed out on the spot that the so-called material evidence presented by the other side was not sufficient to substantiate the accusation. However, after the joint investigation, our side still conducted a detailed and responsible internal investigation, which indeed proved that our nearby troops did not fire towards the location the other side claimed the incident occurred at the time the other side claimed the incident occurred. On November 22nd, our chief liaison officer stated in his reply to the other side that our side could not be responsible for the incident claimed by the other side. The full text of our chief liaison officer's reply is as follows:

"To Colonel McCollas, Chief Liaison Officer of the United Nations Command Delegation:

Regarding the incident mentioned in your letter of November 14th, in which you claimed that one of your unarmed medics was killed by a bullet of a type used by our forces in the restricted area on both sides of the Panmunjom-Munsan highway, 1,500 yards from the perimeter of the Panmunjom conference area, I pointed out during the joint investigation conducted from 15:00 to 18:00 on November 14th that the evidence you provided could not substantiate your accusation. However, our side still conducted a responsible internal investigation into the incident you claimed, confirming that the bullet you claimed was absolutely not fired by our troops near the location you claimed the incident occurred. Your accusation lacks both sufficient evidence and factual basis, and our side cannot be responsible for the incident you claimed.

Colonel Zhang Chunshan, Chief Liaison Officer of the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers Delegation"

    美方诬指我方打死美方人员
    我函告美方对此不能负责
    【新华社开城二十二日电】十一月十四日朝鲜停战谈判美方代表团致函我方首席联络官声称：两天以前在十一月十二日对方人员一名在板门店到汶山的公路两侧的限制区内为一粒我方部队所使用的类型的子弹击毙，当日双方联络官进行了共同调查，对方所提出的仅有物证是一颗子弹和帐篷上据称为这颗子弹所穿透的一个小洞，对方既没有出示所谓被击毙的人的尸体，也没有提出任何足以证明当地确有人被击毙的证据，对方所称出事地点的帐篷内更没有任何血迹。当我方联络官要求确定所谓出事地点与帐篷上小孔的弹道线的方向和高度时，对方又毫无理由地加以阻挠，限制调查的范围。我方联络官当场指出，对方所提出的所谓物证根本不足以证实对方的指控，但我方在共同调查后仍然进行了详细负责的内部调查，确实证明在对方所称出事时间，我方附近部队根本没有向对方所称出事地点进行射击。十一月二十二日我方首席联络官在给对方的答复中声明我方对对方所称事件不能负责，我方首席联络官的复函全文如下：“联合国军代表团首席联络官麦卡塞上校：
    对于十一月十四日来函所称你方非武装的卫生员一名在距板门店会场区周界一千五百码的板门店、汶山公路两侧的限制区内为我方部队使用的类型的子弹所打死的事件，在十一月十四日十五时至十八时进行共同调查时，我已指出，你方提供的证据不能证实你方的指控，但我方仍然对你方所称事件进行了负责的内部调查，确证你方所称该粒子弹绝非你方所称出事地点附近我方部队所射发。你方的指控既无充分证据，更无事实根据，我方对你方所称此次事件不能负责。
    朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团首席联络官张春山上校
