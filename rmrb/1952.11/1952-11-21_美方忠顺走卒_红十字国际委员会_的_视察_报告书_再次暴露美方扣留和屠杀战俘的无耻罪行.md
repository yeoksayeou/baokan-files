Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 20th -- The U.S. side's crime of forcibly depriving prisoners of war of their right to repatriation has been further confirmed by the "inspection" reports of U.S. prisoner of war camps by its loyal lackey, the "International Committee of the Red Cross." These reports were given to our side by this U.S. tool in an attempt to whitewash U.S. war crimes. The reports, written in French, total twenty-six and cover the period from the end of November 1950 to April 6, 1952. From these reports, one can see how ugly and cruel the U.S. hoax of "no forced repatriation of prisoners of war" is. The reports describe in particularly detailed terms the prisoner of war slaughter incidents that occurred last August and December, which the U.S. has not disclosed to date.

The reports reveal that on December 22 and 23 of last year, the U.S. side forcibly "screened" prisoners of war at Camp 62 on Geoje Island, killing and wounding 784 prisoners of war. The report admits that this shocking number of deaths and injuries is based on conversations with prisoner of war representatives and statistics from prisoner of war doctors in the infirmary, and is therefore completely reliable.

It is clear from this report that the reason prisoners of war were slaughtered was their opposition to forced "screening" and forced detention. The prisoners of war in Camp 62 were originally detained by the U.S. side as so-called "detained civilians." However, the report states that these "detained civilians" strongly demanded to "revert to being prisoners of war" because "they hoped to be sent back to the North when the time came." To this end, on December 22 of last year, the U.S. side again sent a so-called South Korean "work team" composed of Syngman Rhee gang special agents to "screen" these prisoners of war, actually forcing them to admit their status as "detained civilians." This illegal act by the U.S. side was immediately and resolutely rejected by the prisoners of war. The Lee gang agents, referred to in the report as "anti-communists," then conducted a large-scale "abuse and torture" of the prisoners of war. All prisoner of war representatives and many prisoners of war were arrested, many prisoners of war were detained in "clubs" where they were "abused," and more prisoners of war detained in a "school" were forced to sit on the ground in the cold all night with their hands clasped behind their necks, and were severely beaten if they moved even slightly. Prisoners of war in tents were also forced to lie face down on the cold ground. However, after this bloody day and night, the prisoners of war still refused to accept "screening." The next morning, U.S. guards opened fire and massacred these prisoners of war who were loyal to their motherland, killing six and wounding thirty-seven, plus those injured by clubs and other means, for a total of 784 prisoners of war killed and wounded.

The report states that the U.S. prisoner of war camp负责人 told the representatives of the "International Committee of the Red Cross" that after this incident, Camp 62 had been designated as a communist prisoner of war camp, and communist prisoners of war from other camps were concentrated in this camp. Although the U.S. officially admitted that all the prisoners of war in Camp 62 demanded to return to their motherland, it still did not abandon its attempt to force them to change their minds. As everyone knows, on February 18 of this year, the U.S. side used bayonets to conduct a "re-screening" of the prisoners of war in this camp, resulting in 373 prisoners of war being killed and wounded. The "International Committee of the Red Cross" had already been forced to admit this incident.

These shocking incidents of prisoner of war slaughter demonstrate that from the very beginning of the discussions on the issue of prisoners of war in the Korean armistice negotiations last year, the U.S. side had tried every means to forcibly detain prisoners of war, and used bayonets to forcibly "screen" prisoners of war, wanting them to accept a life of enslavement. The American aggressors claimed in their report to the United Nations General Assembly that they did not begin "screening" prisoners of war until April of this year. This outrageous lie has been completely exposed by these two slaughter incidents.

Another report by the "International Committee of the Red Cross" on its "inspection" of the Geoje Island and Busan prisoner of war camps from August 19 to September 2 of last year reveals that the U.S. side had long used slaughter in these camps to deprive prisoners of war of the rights stipulated in the Geneva Convention and to suppress the prisoners of war's firm will to be repatriated. The report states that on August 15 of last year, six prisoners of war were killed and twenty-six wounded because they celebrated their motherland's Liberation Day. The report also reveals that on this day, the U.S. side systematically slaughtered prisoners of war celebrating the festival in many camps in the Busan and Geoje Island prisoner of war camps, killing a total of eighteen prisoners of war and wounding seventy-five.

The incidents of the U.S. slaughtering prisoners of war are so numerous that even the "International Committee of the Red Cross" had to say in its report that these reports on the slaughter incidents "are still incomplete." At the same time, the report also had to admit, albeit hesitatingly: "These incidents are the result of the prisoner of war authorities' serious paranoia." Obviously, the so-called "serious paranoia" is the U.S. side's insistence on forcibly detaining prisoners of war.

The report published a letter from all the prisoners of war in Camp 63 on Geoje Island to the prisoner of war camp authorities on August 30 of last year. In this letter, the prisoners of war strongly protested the U.S. side's outrageous crimes of persecuting prisoners of war. The prisoners of war demanded that the U.S. side "not violate the rights of prisoners of war guaranteed by the Geneva Convention," including "not infringing on the status of our elected officers and soldiers representatives," "prohibiting attacks and beatings of prisoners of war," "immediately releasing all officers and soldiers representatives who are or have been arrested," and "granting the right to hold ceremonies in accordance with our national customs." The report also reveals that more than 30,000 Korean People's Army prisoners of war in the sixth district of Geoje Island, who were forcibly called "detained civilians," strongly "protested the measures to change the status of the prisoners of war in the sixth district," because the prisoner of war authorities "had decided that these detained civilians would return to South Korea." The report also reveals that Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war similarly strongly protested that "certain pressure to return to Taiwan or North Korea should not be implemented in the camps."

From these twenty-six reports, one can also see many of the U.S. prisoner of war camp authorities' shameless crimes, such as cutting off food supplies to Camp 66. American sergeants frequently broke into female prisoner of war camps to commit rape, and used searches as an excuse to strip them naked and insult them. Representatives elected by prisoners of war in accordance with the Geneva Convention were frequently arrested by the U.S. side and secretly interrogated in confinement. In every camp, captured officers and soldiers accused the U.S. side of torture during interrogation. A representative of the "International Committee of the Red Cross" admitted that he personally witnessed a prisoner of war being severely beaten during interrogation.

It can also be seen from the reports that the "inspection" representatives of the "International Committee of the Red Cross" were always loyal to the U.S. prisoner of war camp authorities. They warned prisoners of war to be law-abiding, and spared no effort to defend the U.S. side in every way. But between the lines of these reports, one can still find a basic fact, that is: in the U.S. prisoner of war camps, prisoners of war have no "individual rights" or "individual freedom"; all they have is the "right" and "freedom" of the U.S. side to slaughter and detain prisoners of war.

    美方忠顺走卒“红十字国际委员会”的“视察”报告书
    再次暴露美方扣留和屠杀战俘的无耻罪行
    【新华社开城二十日电】美方用暴力剥夺战俘遣返权利的罪行，从其忠顺走卒“红十字国际委员会”的美方战俘营“视察”报告书中又得到了新的证实。这些报告书是这个美方御用组织交给我方，企图替美方洗刷战争罪行的。报告书共二十六份，用法文写成；“视察”日期包括从一九五零年十一月底到一九五二年四月六日之间的一段时期。从这些报告书里，人们可以看到美方“不强迫遣返战俘”的骗局是多么丑恶与残酷。报告书特别详细地叙述了美方迄今没有透露过的发生在去年八月和十二月的屠杀战俘事件。
    报告书透露：在去年十二月二十二日和二十三日，美方在巨济岛战俘营第六十二号营场用武力强迫“甄别”战俘，打死打伤战俘七百八十四名。报告书承认：这个令人震惊的屠杀数字，是根据战俘代表的谈话和医疗所战俘医生的统计得来的，因而是完全可靠的。
    由这个报告书中可以明显地看出，战俘被屠杀的原因是他们反对强迫“甄别”和强迫扣留。六十二号营场的战俘原是被美方硬说是“被拘留平民”而加以扣留的。但是报告书说这些“被拘留平民”却强烈地要求“恢复成为战俘”，因为“他们期望时机到来就被送回到北方去”。为此，在去年十二月二十二日，美方又派遣由李承晚匪帮特务组成的所谓南朝鲜“工作队”，对这些战俘进行“甄别”，实际上是强迫他们承认“被拘留平民”的身份。美方这一非法行为当即遭到战俘的坚决拒绝。被报告书称为“反共分子”的李匪特务就大规模地对战俘“进行虐待和施以酷刑”。所有的战俘代表和许多战俘被拘捕，许多战俘被关在“俱乐部”里“受到虐待”；更多的被关在一个“学校”里的战俘，被迫双手抱在颈上在寒冷中在地上坐了一整夜，稍有移动就遭受毒打。帐篷里的战俘也被强迫面朝下躺在冰冷的地上。但是，在这血腥的一昼夜之后，战俘依旧拒绝接受“甄别”。第二天早晨，美方警卫就对这些忠诚于祖国的战俘开枪屠杀，打死六名，伤三十七名，加上被用棍棒等打伤的，共死伤战俘七百八十四名。
    报告书说：美方战俘营负责人告诉“红十字国际委员会”的代表说，在这次事件之后，第六十二号营场已被认为是共产党战俘营场，其他营场的共产党战俘都被集中到这个营场来。美方虽然正式承认第六十二号营场的战俘全都要求回到祖国，但是仍然没有放弃强迫他们改变主意的企图。大家知道，今年二月十八日，美方就用刺刀对这个营场的战俘进行“重新甄别”，结果打死打伤战俘三百七十三人。关于这次事件，“红十字国际委员会”早已被迫承认过了。
    这些惊人的屠杀战俘事件，说明美方从去年朝鲜停战谈判有关战俘问题的讨论一开始，就想尽各种办法来强迫扣留战俘，并用刺刀强迫“甄别”战俘，要他们接受被奴役的命运。美国侵略者在其给联合国大会的报告中声称他们是从今年四月间才开始“甄别”战俘的。这个漫天大谎已经被这两次屠杀事件彻底揭穿了。
    “红十字国际委员会”的另一个关于去年八月十九日到九月二日“视察”巨济岛和釜山战俘营的报告书透露：美方早就在这个营场里用屠杀的手段来剥夺日内瓦公约规定的战俘的权利，和打击战俘的要求遣返的坚定意志。报告书说：在去年八月十五日，由于战俘庆祝他们祖国的解放日，就被打死六名，打伤二十六名。报告书并透露：在这一天，美方在釜山和巨济岛战俘营的许多营场内，有计划地屠杀庆祝节日的战俘，共打死战俘十八名，打伤七十五名。
    美方屠杀战俘的事件多到无法计数，连“红十字国际委员会”也不得不在报告书中说：这些关于屠杀事件的报告“还是不完全的”。同时报告书也不得不吞吞吐吐地承认：“这些事件是由于战俘当局严重的偏执的结果”。显然，所谓“严重的偏执”，就是美方执意要强迫扣留战俘。
    报告书公布了去年八月三十日巨济岛战俘营第六十三号营场全体战俘给战俘营当局的一封信。战俘们在这封信中强烈抗议美方迫害战俘的骇人听闻的罪行。战俘们要求美方“不要侵犯日内瓦公约所保证的战俘的权利”，包括“不要侵犯我们所选举出来的官兵代表的身份”，“禁止攻击和殴打战俘”，
    “立即释放现在或过去所拘捕的所有官兵代表”，
    “给予按照我们国家习俗举行仪式的权利”。报告书同时透露：巨济岛第六营区的三万多被硬称为“被拘留平民”的朝鲜人民军战俘，强烈地“抗议改变第六营区战俘的身份的措施”，因为战俘当局“已决定这些被拘留平民回到南朝鲜去”。报告书并透露：中国人民志愿军战俘同样强烈地抗议“回台湾还是回北朝鲜的某种压力不应在各营场战俘中实施”。
    从这二十六份报告书中，还可以看到美方战俘营当局的许多无耻罪行，例如：对六十六号营场断绝食粮供应。美国的军士经常闯入女战俘营进行强奸，并藉口搜查，脱光她们的衣服进行侮辱。战俘根据日内瓦公约规定选出的代表经常被美方逮捕，并被禁闭起来进行秘密审问。在每一个营场中，被俘官兵都控诉在被审问时受到酷刑。“红十字国际委员会”的一个代表承认，他亲眼看见一名战俘在被审问时遭到毒打。
    由报告书中也可以看出，“红十字国际委员会”的“视察”代表们，随时都效忠于美国战俘营当局。他们警告战俘要安分守己，并且处处都不遗余力地替美方辩解。但是从这些报告的字里行间，仍可以发现一个基本事实，那就是：在美方战俘营内，战俘根本没有“个人权利”、“个人自由”；有的只是美方屠杀和扣留战俘的“权利”和“自由”。
