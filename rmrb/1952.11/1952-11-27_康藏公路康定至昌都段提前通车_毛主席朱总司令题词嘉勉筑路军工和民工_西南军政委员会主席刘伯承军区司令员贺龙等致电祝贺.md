Xinhua News Agency, Qamdo, November 25th: The Kangding-Qamdo section of the Kangzang Highway officially opened to traffic on the 20th, ahead of schedule. A grand opening ceremony was held on the morning of the 20th at Sichuan Dam near Qamdo. Attending the ceremony were people of all ethnic groups from Qamdo, civilian workers of all ethnic groups, troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Qamdo, and troops participating in the road construction. A motorcade fifty miles long, fully loaded with supplies, crossed the Damara Mountain summit, 5,000 meters above sea level, and entered Sichuan Dam. The whole area erupted in enthusiastic cheers.

At the opening ceremony, Feng Zhifang, Deputy Political Commissar of the road-building troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, delivered a speech, congratulating the Tibetan people and paying tribute to the hardworking and brave road-building troops and people of all ethnic groups. Tusi, headmen, Living Buddhas, and Lamas from various Zong (counties) under the jurisdiction of the Qamdo area solemnly presented Hada to the portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu on the floats. Tibetan students from Qamdo Elementary School climbed onto the brand-new cars and presented flowers to the drivers. Tibetan women put on festive costumes early in the morning and rushed to participate in the ceremony to welcome the incoming cars. On the 21st, people from all walks of life in Qamdo held a grand celebration meeting in Sichuan Dam. Bangda Dorje (Tibetan), Hou Jie, and others, deputy directors of the Qamdo Area People's Liberation Committee, delivered speeches at the meeting. They said: The opening of the Kangzang Highway to Qamdo is the beginning of the Tibetan people, especially the people of the Qamdo area, moving towards happiness and prosperity, and is the result of Chairman Mao's wise leadership. They called on the people of the Qamdo area to better support the road-building troops and civilian workers, and continue to build the highway to Lhasa. At the meeting, Xie Wala Living Buddha of Qamdo Lama Temple, military engineering road-building heroes and models, and others were also invited to speak. In the evening, Tibetan compatriots held picnics with ghee and zanba inside tents set up on Sichuan Dam, and performed a large-scale song and dance with hundreds of people.

The Kangzang Highway is the main transportation line connecting Xikang and Tibet, and is of great significance for consolidating national defense and prospering the economy of the Tibetan people. The starting point of this highway is Kangding in Xikang Province, and the ending point is Lhasa, the capital of Tibet. The route passes through high mountains and deep valleys stretching for thousands of miles, and crosses dangerous natural barriers such as the Jinsha River, the Nujiang River, and the Lancang River with rapid currents. The project is extremely arduous. The road-building troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the people of all ethnic groups in the Kangzang area overcame numerous difficulties and completed the construction of the highway to Qamdo fifty days ahead of schedule. On the eve of the opening, Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the Chinese People's Liberation Army both wrote inscriptions to express their condolences to the hardworking and brave road-building troops and civilian workers. Chairman Mao's inscription reads: "In order to help all fraternal ethnic groups, fear no difficulties, and strive to build roads!" Commander-in-Chief Zhu's inscription reads: "Soldiers and civilians unite as one, overcome natural dangers, overcome difficulties, open up Kangzang transportation, and strive to complete the glorious task of consolidating national defense and prospering the economy!"

Xinhua News Agency, Qamdo, November 26th: The leaders of the government and army in the Southwest Region sent telegrams to congratulate the opening of the Kangzang Highway to Qamdo, and commended the military engineers and civilian workers who participated in the road construction project. Liu Bocheng, Chairman of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee, and He Long, Commander of the Southwest Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, said in the commendation telegram: "The opening of the Kangzang Highway to Qamdo has laid a good foundation for future Kangzang transportation construction work, and has made significant contributions to national defense construction, the development of Tibet's economy, and national unity." Wang Weizhou, Vice Chairman of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee and concurrently Chairman of the Ethnic Affairs Committee, said in his congratulatory telegram: "The opening of the Kangzang Highway to Qamdo has not only changed the historically blocked transportation situation in the Kangzang area, becoming a major artery for the Tibetan people to develop production and prosper the economy, but also is more conducive to economic cooperation and cultural exchanges among all ethnic groups, making national unity more consolidated and close." All the representatives of the various Zong (counties) of the Qamdo area production conference, which will soon open in Qamdo, said in their congratulatory letter: "The opening of the highway to Qamdo has brought us economic prosperity and cultural light. It is the great people's leader Chairman Mao's boundless concern and love for the people of Kangzang. We wholeheartedly support the great leader Chairman Mao and will work hard to support transportation work in the future."
