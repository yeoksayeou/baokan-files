To meet the upcoming large-scale anti-illiteracy campaign, the Department of Workers' and Peasants' Spare-Time Education of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government has compiled a set of fast literacy teaching materials and textbooks suitable for workers and peasants, which are published by the Workers' Publishing House and the People's Education Publishing House, respectively. The printing plates will be distributed to the People's Publishing Houses in major administrative regions for printing, and distributed by the general and branch stores of Xinhua Bookstore in various places. The textbook prices will also be reduced to reduce the burden on worker and peasant students.

Now, the fast literacy teaching materials and literacy textbooks for workers and peasants have been published. The fast literacy teaching material is compiled to match the literacy textbook, and its content includes phonetic alphabet, phonetic exercises, phonetic vocabulary, writing practice table, and a list of two thousand commonly used characters. The principles of character arrangement are to make the meaning of the characters as simple as possible and the shape of the characters as simple to complex as possible; and to strive for neatness and eye-catching, so that students can read backwards or sideways when reviewing, in order to correct the problem of jingles. Workers or peasant students who have completed the fast literacy teaching materials can study the literacy textbooks. The "Staff Literacy Textbook" is bound into two volumes, upper (including Volumes 1 and 2) and lower (including Volumes 3 and 4), for use in staff spare-time schools. The "Peasant Literacy Textbook" is bound into two volumes, upper (including Volumes 1 and 2) and lower (including Volumes 3 and 4), for use in the early stage of peasant spare-time elementary schools or winter schools. In addition, four volumes of "Peasant Language Textbooks" have been compiled for use by peasants who have completed the literacy textbooks.

In order to help teachers understand the basic spirit and teaching methods of the fast literacy method, the People's Education Publishing House has published the "Teacher's Manual for Universal Rapid Literacy Method for Workers and Peasants". The content of this manual includes the creation process of the rapid literacy method, the teaching process, and several things to pay attention to in teaching.

In addition, "Examples of Common Character Usage" (compiled by Xinhua Dictionary Society), phonetic alphabet tables, phonetic alphabet cards (divided into large and small sizes), etc. will also be published in large quantities. (Xinhua News Agency)

    速成识字教材和课本已出版
    为了迎接即将到来的大规模的扫除文盲运动，中央人民政府教育部工农业余教育司已编就一套适合于工人和农民用的速成识字教材和课本，分别由工人出版社、人民教育出版社出版，将纸型分发各大行政区人民出版社印刷，由各地新华书店总分店发行。并把课本定价降低，以减轻工农学员的负担。
    现在工人和农民用的速成识字教材和识字课本都已出版。速成识字教材是配合识字课本编写的，内容包括注音字母、拼音练习、注音词表、写字练习表和两千个常用字表五部分。它们的生字编排原则，是尽量按照字义由浅入深，字形由简到繁；并力求整齐醒目，以便学员在复习时可以倒念、横念，以纠正顺口溜的毛病。学完速成识字教材的工人或农民学员就可以学习识字课本了。“职工识字课本”合订为上（包括一、二两册）下（包括三、四两册）两册，供职工业余学校采用。“农民识字课本”合订为上（包括一、二两册）下（包括三、四两册）两册，供农民业余初等学校前期或冬学采用。另外，还编了四册“农民语文课本”，供给学完了识字课本的农民采用。
    为了帮助教师们了解速成识字法的基本精神和教学方法，人民教育出版社已出版“工农通用速成识字法教师手册”。这本手册的内容包括速成识字法创造的经过、教学过程和教学中应注意的几件事等。
    另外，“常用字用法举例”（新华辞书社编），注音字母表、注音字母卡片（分大、小两种）等也将大量出版。    （新华社）
