After Huang Huoqing delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the people of Tianjin, Liu Jingfan, head of the 团 (Mission), spoke. He said: Following the instructions of the people of the whole country, we met with the Chinese People's Volunteer Army extensively and deeply, from the Yalu River to near the 38th parallel. In addition to distributing慰问品 (comfort items) to the Volunteer Army, the most important thing was to convey to them Chairman Mao's and the people of the whole country's concern, as well as the achievements of the motherland's great construction over the past three years. The comrades of the Volunteer Army deeply cherish the profound affection of the people of the motherland. They solemnly swore: "We are the sons and daughters of the Chinese people. In order to thank Chairman Mao and the people of the whole country for their concern, and in order to complete the sacred task entrusted to us by the people of the motherland, we are determined to fight to the end for the complete victory of 抗美援朝 (Resist America, Aid Korea)." Liu Jingfan also said: The heroic Korean People's Army and the Korean people expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese people for their active assistance and deep condolences. He called on the people of the whole country to continue to deepen the 抗美援朝 (Resist America, Aid Korea) movement, consolidate national defense, and accelerate economic construction, so as to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean people with practical and effective actions. In his speech, Deputy Head Chen Yi focused on specific examples to describe the tremendous changes that have taken place on the Korean battlefield in the past year, the vigorous morale of the Volunteer Army commanders and fighters, and their love for the motherland. He said: The airplanes and artillery donated by the people of the motherland have greatly boosted the confidence of the Volunteer Army soldiers after they were sent to the front lines in Korea. The Volunteer Army soldiers are always concerned about Chairman Mao's health and the achievements of the people of the motherland in construction. They earnestly hope that the people of the motherland will work hard to improve the construction work, because building the motherland better is also more effectively supporting them.

Deputy heads Li Minghao, Hu Juewen, and Zhou Qinyue also spoke at the meeting one after another. They unanimously praised the lofty patriotism and internationalism of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the Korean People's Army, and the Korean people, and hoped that people from all walks of life would continue to deepen the 抗美援朝 (Resist America, Aid Korea) movement.

After the meeting, patriotic artist Chang Xiangyu and the Xiangyu Opera Troupe performed豫剧 (Henan Opera) programs such as "Broken Bridge."

In the evening, Wu De, Deputy Mayor of Tianjin, held a grand banquet to welcome all members of the 慰问团 (Comfort Mission).
