    Interview with Churaki, Leader of the Soviet Art Delegation
    Lin Danqiu

    Churaki, who led the Soviet Art Delegation to China to participate in the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities, is the Vice-Chairman of the Art Committee of the Soviet Council of Ministers, one of the secretaries of the Soviet Composers Association, and a famous Soviet composer. His "Second Symphony," "The Pretended Fiancé," and the trilogy "Youth" earned him the Stalin Prize three times. When composing these pieces, he worked ten to twelve hours a day, and each piece took more than a year and a half to create. "I don't know how much paper I wasted!" he said with a smile. But he was so modest that he spoke very little about his creative experience. He told reporters, "Creative experience? Creation mainly relies on hard work. If you write a piece and don't like it, you think again and write again. If you write ten pieces, it's good if one is usable."

    This serious and responsible creative attitude is shared by Soviet artists. This is one of the reasons why the Soviet art world has achieved remarkable achievements.

    "The greatest achievement of the Soviet art world is to make art something for the broad masses of people, something understood by the broad masses of people," Churaki said. "The standard for Soviet artists in choosing themes from real life or historical materials is to see whether it is of concern to the people and whether it can educate the people. The glorious deeds of the people are the objects that Soviet creators want to express. But this is only one side of the problem. On the other hand, Soviet artists attach great importance to the quality of their works, striving to make their works highly infectious works of art. It is easy to understand why Soviet works of art are universally loved by people at home and abroad."

    He cited many examples. For example, in the art of sculpture, among the many works expressing great modern themes, the statue of the giant Stalin is first worth introducing. This statue, built on the Volga section of the Lenin Volga-Don Canal, is fifty meters high and has a durability that can last for three thousand years. This is a masterpiece and a monument in the history of the development of Soviet sculpture. "The Statue of Liberty" has always been known as the tallest statue in the world, but its height is only eighteen meters, less than half the height of the Stalin statue. In the Soviet Union, a comprehensive creative plan has been formulated in the field of sculpture, and some of the plans have been realized. On the battlefield where the Soviet army fought against the German fascist bandits, a large number of sculptural works depicting fierce battle scenes have appeared. Sculptural works are being built in the place where 330,000 enemies were wiped out in the Battle of Stalingrad. Sculptural works of art also appear on various buildings, in the subway, and in the daily lives of the people to enhance the general public's artistic interest.

    In terms of music, Soviet composers have recently created many pieces with themes that are of most concern to the people, such as economic construction issues and the issue of defending world peace. These pieces have played a great role in uniting and inspiring the will of millions of people. In terms of painting, Soviet painters not only express nature, but also focus on expressing the great labor of people transforming nature, in order to educate the people and inspire the people to continuously improve their labor enthusiasm. In order to popularize art in all aspects, the Soviet art world tries its best to hold musical performances, print as many painting reproductions as possible, and print as many excellent literary works as possible. "In short, we do everything we can to realize Lenin and Stalin's instructions: art belongs to the people. Contrary to the reactionaries, we not only introduce art to the people, but also vigorously cultivate the people's own creation, improve and improve existing people's art. The role of art in the cause of communism is to educate the builders of communism. Without huge artistic wealth, it is impossible to implement communism," Churaki emphasized.

    In order to educate the people, Soviet artists are using various brilliant artistic creations to reflect the great achievements of peaceful construction at home. "After the 19th Party Congress, artists in all fields will use their respective artistic means to express the various construction achievements reflected in the Party Congress. They will answer this Party Congress with further popularization and improvement of art itself," Churaki said.

    The conversation shifted to the essential differences between Soviet art and bourgeois art, touching on the fundamental reasons for the corruption and degeneration of bourgeois art. Churaki said that bourgeois art does not aim to win the love of the broad masses of people, but looks down on the people, is divorced from the people, and does not express the advanced ideas and healthy emotions of the people, and as a result, it becomes a formalistic pastime. Such stuff certainly has no future for development. Secondly, bourgeois art, in contrast to Soviet art, despises national characteristics, does not respect the artistic treasures of each nation, and obliterates the nationality of art. Detaching oneself from the life of the people and abolishing the national artistic tradition is tantamount to destroying the foundation for the development of any art.

    When talking about the issue of accepting outstanding national artistic heritage, Comrade Churaki said bluntly: "This is the most fundamental issue in the Soviet art world." He said that the Soviet art world's attitude towards artistic heritage is entirely based on respect. Without heritage, it is impossible to build today's art; promoting the excellent artistic traditions of the past is necessary for the development of today's art, otherwise the so-called new art is just a castle in the sand. Formalists deny artistic heritage and national forms. They flaunt "new forms" that no one understands, but the people do not need this kind of thing. "Artistic heritage is ultimately created by the people, and denying heritage is denying the people!" He concluded the conversation on this issue in this way.

    Comrade Churaki's remarks on Sino-Soviet friendship and cultural exchanges between the two countries gave great enlightenment and encouragement to China's cultural and artistic circles. He said that the common goals of China and the Soviet Union guarantee the growing development and consolidation of the friendship between the two countries, and guarantee the increasing expansion of cultural exchanges between the two countries. This is of great help to the cultural life of the two peoples and to world lasting peace. The mutual visits of delegations from the two countries continuously promote mutual understanding between the two peoples. "For example, our visit here to participate in the 'Sino-Soviet Friendship Month' activities is an important way to develop and consolidate the friendship between the two peoples." He said that the Soviet people love the art of the new China. The Moscow Cultural Palace held two large-scale Chinese music concerts in the music hall that can accommodate 15,000 people during the "Chinese Music Festival" (July 17). Many Soviet composers are studying Chinese music and creating pieces about the new China. For example, Kolchimarev recently created a piece called "Liberated China."

    "The experiences of all aspects of the Soviet art world are very useful to the art world of the new China," Comrade Churaki continued. "For example, the Soviet art world made mistakes in the past in accepting national heritage and developing national forms, but later corrected them. With this experience, the Chinese art world can avoid making mistakes again. This is help. It is necessary to develop national forms. Without national forms, it is impossible to create works that are loved by the broad masses of people."

    The night before the reporters interviewed him, Comrade Churaki watched a Chinese old opera and was very interested. "The expressive methods of Chinese old opera are expressive methods accumulated over hundreds of years," he said. "Of course, to express modern life and characters, old art forms should be appropriately transformed and improved, but this form should never be fundamentally abandoned, because this form is loved by the Chinese people. Such a special art form as China is rare in the world and should be fully respected. I say again, this form should be developed, not abandoned. The task placed before the new Chinese art workers is very arduous. If such an ancient country with such a rich artistic heritage is studied well, it will definitely be able to absorb many things from the past art treasures. Of course, the creation of a new art in a country is impossible in an isolated state. The arts of various countries must influence each other in their development, and should absorb things from the excellent arts of other countries that are conducive to the creation of the new art of their own country. But one must never mechanically imitate foreign art, and one must absorb foreign things on the basis of one's own national artistic tradition to enrich one's own art treasure. The new art of China must have Chinese national characteristics."

    There were many more questions to ask Comrade Churaki, but time did not allow it. Even in this conversation of less than two hours, Comrade Churaki not only improved our understanding of Soviet culture and art, but also further strengthened our confidence in the development of our own national culture and art. In order to better implement the literary and artistic line of our people's leader Mao Zedong and accelerate the development of the people's art of the new China, we must learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet art world in a down-to-earth manner. How much inspiration Comrade Churaki's remarks have given us! (Attached picture)

    访苏联艺术工作团领导人楚拉基
    林淡秋
    率领苏联艺术工作团前来我国参加“中苏友好月”活动的楚拉基，是苏联部长会议艺术委员会副主席，苏联作曲家协会书记之一，苏联有名的作曲家。他的“第二交响曲”、“假未婚夫”和“青春”三部曲子，使他三次获得斯大林奖金。在创作这些曲子的时候，他每天工作十到十二小时，每一部曲子的创作时间都在一年半以上。“不知道浪费了多少纸张呀！”他笑着说。但他是那样谦虚，关于自己的创作经验，谈得很少。他回答记者们说：“创作经验吗？创作主要靠努力，写了一个曲子，觉得不好，再想，再写。写十个曲子，有一个可用，就算不错了。”
    这种认真负责的创作态度，正是苏联艺术家们所共有的。这是苏联艺术界所以获得卓越成就的原因之一。
    “苏联艺术界的最大成就，就是使艺术成为广大人民的东西，成为广大人民所理解的东西”，楚拉基说。“苏联艺术家从现实生活中或从历史材料中选择主题的标准，就是看它是否为人民所关心，能否给人民以教育。人民的光辉事迹，都是苏联创作家们所要表现的对象。但这不过是问题的一面。而另一方面，苏联艺术家们非常注重作品的质量，竭力要使自己的作品成为具有高度感染力量的艺术品。苏联艺术作品所以能得到国内外人民的普遍爱好，那是容易理解的。”
    他举了好些例子。例如雕塑艺术吧，在许多表现现代伟大主题的作品中，首先值得介绍的是巨人斯大林的塑像。这个塑像，建立在列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河的伏尔加河那一段，高达五十公尺，有可以保存三千年的耐久性。这是一个杰作，是苏联雕塑艺术发展史上的丰碑。“自由女神”一向被称为全世界最高的塑像，但它的高度不过十八公尺，不到斯大林塑像高度的一半。在苏联，雕塑艺术方面已经订出了全面的创作计划，有一部分计划已经实现了。在苏军跟德国法西斯匪徒作战的战场上，已经出现了大批表现激烈战斗场面的雕塑作品。在斯大林格勒保卫战中歼灭了三十三万敌人的地方，正在建立着雕塑作品。雕塑艺术品还出现在各种建筑物上，出现在地下铁道，出现在人民的日常生活中，以提高一般人民的艺术兴趣。
    在音乐方面，苏联作曲家们最近创作了许多以人民最关心的问题为主题的曲子，例如关于经济建设问题、保卫世界和平问题等。这些曲子在团结和鼓舞千百万人民的意志方面发挥了很大作用。在绘画方面，苏联画家们不但表现自然，而且着重表现人改造自然的伟大劳动，以教育人民，鼓舞人民不断提高劳动热情。为了普及各方面的艺术，苏联艺术界尽量举行音乐演奏会，尽量多印绘画复制品，尽量多印优秀的文学作品。“总之，我们尽一切力量来实现列宁和斯大林的指示：艺术属于人民。我们跟反动派相反，非但把艺术介绍给人民，而且大力培养人民自己的创作，改进和提高现有的人民艺术。艺术在共产主义事业中的作用，就是教育共产主义的建设者。如果没有巨大的艺术财富，实行共产主义是不可能的。”楚拉基着重地说。
    为了教育人民，苏联艺术家们正用各种辉煌的艺术创作来反映国内和平建设的伟大成就。“在第十九次党代表大会之后，各方面的艺术家都要以各自的艺术手段，表现出党代表大会所反映的各项建设成就。他们要用艺术本身的进一步普及和提高来回答这次党代表大会。”楚拉基说。
    谈话转移到苏联艺术与资产阶级艺术在本质上的区别，接触到资产阶级艺术所以腐化堕落的基本原因。楚拉基说，资产阶级艺术不是以博得广大人民的爱好为目的，而是看不起人民，脱离人民，不表现人民的先进思想和健康感情，结果变成了形式主义的消遣品。这样的货色当然没有什么发展前途的。其次，资产阶级的艺术跟苏联的艺术相反，轻视民族的特点，不尊重每个民族的艺术宝库，抹杀艺术的民族性。脱离人民的生活，取消民族的艺术传统，就等于摧毁了任何艺术的发展基础。
    谈到接受民族优秀艺术遗产问题时，楚拉基同志劈头就说：“这是苏联艺术界最基本的问题。”他说苏联艺术界对艺术遗产的态度，完全是建立在尊敬的基础之上的。没有遗产，就不可能建设今天的艺术；发扬过去优秀的艺术传统，正是发展今天的艺术所必需的，否则所谓新艺术，不过是沙滩上的楼阁罢了。形式主义者是否认艺术遗产、否认民族形式的，他们以谁也不懂的“新形式”自炫，但人民不需要这一类东西。“艺术遗产归根结底是人民创造的，否认遗产，就是否认人民！”他这样结束了关于这一问题的谈话。
    楚拉基同志关于中苏友谊和两国文化交流的谈话，给与我国文化艺术界很大的启发和鼓舞。他说中苏目标的相同，保证了两国友谊的日益发展和巩固，保证了两国文化交流的日益扩大。这对于两国人民的文化生活与世界持久和平都有莫大的助益。两国代表团的相互往来，不断地促进了两国人民的相互了解。“例如我们这次来此参加‘中苏友好月’活动，就是发展和巩固两国人民友谊的重要方法。”他说苏联人民热爱新中国的艺术，莫斯科文化宫在“中国音乐节”（七月十七日），在可容一万五千人的音乐堂里举行了两次大规模的中国音乐演奏会。苏联许多作曲家都在研究中国音乐，创作关于新中国的曲子。例如最近柯尔契马寥夫就作出了名为“解放了的中国”的曲子。
    “苏联艺术界的各方面经验，对新中国艺术界有很大的用处”，楚拉基同志接着说。“例如苏联艺术界过去在接受民族遗产、发展民族形式问题上曾犯过错误，后来改正了。有了这个经验，中国艺术界就可以不再犯错误了。这就是帮助。一定要发展民族形式，脱离了民族形式，要创作出为广大人民所热爱的作品，是不可能的。”
    在记者们访问他的前一天晚上，楚拉基同志看了中国旧剧，很感兴趣。“中国旧剧的表现方法，是数百年来积累起来的表现方法，”他说。“自然，要表现现代的生活和人物，旧的艺术形式应该适当地加以改造和提高，但决不能根本舍弃这种形式，因为这种形式是中国人民所喜爱的。像中国这样特殊的艺术形式，世界上是少有的，应该充分加以尊重。我再说一遍，应该发展这种形式，不能抛弃这种形式。放在新中国艺术工作者面前的任务，是非常艰巨的。这样的古国，这样丰富的艺术遗产，要是好好加以研究，一定可以从过去的艺术宝库中吸取许多东西。自然，一国新艺术的创造，是不可能在孤立的状态下进行的，各国艺术在其发展过程中必然要互相影响，应该从其他国家优秀艺术中吸取有利于本国新艺术的创造的东西。但绝不能机械地摹仿外国的艺术，一定要在本国艺术传统的基础上吸收外国的东西，以丰富自己的艺术宝库。中国的新艺术，必须具有中国民族特色。”
    需要请教楚拉基同志的问题还多得很，但时间已经不容许了。即使在这不到两个钟头的谈话中，楚拉基同志不但提高了我们对于苏联文化艺术的认识，而且益发加强了我们对自己祖国文化艺术的发展的信心。为了更好地执行我国人民领袖毛泽东的文艺路线，加速新中国人民艺术的发展，我们必须踏踏实实地学习苏联艺术界的先进经验。楚拉基同志的谈话，给了我们多么大的启发呀。（附图片）
