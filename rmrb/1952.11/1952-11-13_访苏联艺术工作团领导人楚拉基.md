    Interview with Churaki, Leader of the Soviet Art Delegation
    Lin Danqiu

    Churaki, who led the Soviet Art Delegation to China to participate in the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities, is the Vice-Chairman of the Art Committee of the Soviet Council of Ministers, one of the secretaries of the Soviet Composers Association, and a famous Soviet composer. His "Second Symphony," "The Pretended Fianc√©," and the trilogy "Youth" earned him the Stalin Prize three times. When composing these pieces, he worked ten to twelve hours a day, and each piece took more than a year and a half to create. "I don't know how much paper I wasted!" he said with a smile. But he was so modest that he spoke very little about his creative experience. He told reporters, "Creative experience? Creation mainly relies on hard work. If you write a piece and don't like it, you think again and write again. If you write ten pieces, it's good if one is usable."

    This serious and responsible creative attitude is shared by Soviet artists. This is one of the reasons why the Soviet art world has achieved remarkable achievements.

    "The greatest achievement of the Soviet art world is to make art something for the broad masses of people, something understood by the broad masses of people," Churaki said. "The standard for Soviet artists in choosing themes from real life or historical materials is to see whether it is of concern to the people and whether it can educate the people. The glorious deeds of the people are the objects that Soviet creators want to express. But this is only one side of the problem. On the other hand, Soviet artists attach great importance to the quality of their works, striving to make their works highly infectious works of art. It is easy to understand why Soviet works of art are universally loved by people at home and abroad."

    He cited many examples. For example, in the art of sculpture, among the many works expressing great modern themes, the statue of the giant Stalin is first worth introducing. This statue, built on the Volga section of the Lenin Volga-Don Canal, is fifty meters high and has a durability that can last for three thousand years. This is a masterpiece and a monument in the history of the development of Soviet sculpture. "The Statue of Liberty" has always been known as the tallest statue in the world, but its height is only eighteen meters, less than half the height of the Stalin statue. In the Soviet Union, a comprehensive creative plan has been formulated in the field of sculpture, and some of the plans have been realized. On the battlefield where the Soviet army fought against the German fascist bandits, a large number of sculptural works depicting fierce battle scenes have appeared. Sculptural works are being built in the place where 330,000 enemies were wiped out in the Battle of Stalingrad. Sculptural works of art also appear on various buildings, in the subway, and in the daily lives of the people to enhance the general public's artistic interest.

    In terms of music, Soviet composers have recently created many pieces with themes that are of most concern to the people, such as economic construction issues and the issue of defending world peace. These pieces have played a great role in uniting and inspiring the will of millions of people. In terms of painting, Soviet painters not only express nature, but also focus on expressing the great labor of people transforming nature, in order to educate the people and inspire the people to continuously improve their labor enthusiasm. In order to popularize art in all aspects, the Soviet art world tries its best to hold musical performances, print as many painting reproductions as possible, and print as many excellent literary works as possible. "In short, we do everything we can to realize Lenin and Stalin's instructions: art belongs to the people. Contrary to the reactionaries, we not only introduce art to the people, but also vigorously cultivate the people's own creation, improve and improve existing people's art. The role of art in the cause of communism is to educate the builders of communism. Without huge artistic wealth, it is impossible to implement communism," Churaki emphasized.

    In order to educate the people, Soviet artists are using various brilliant artistic creations to reflect the great achievements of peaceful construction at home. "After the 19th Party Congress, artists in all fields will use their respective artistic means to express the various construction achievements reflected in the Party Congress. They will answer this Party Congress with further popularization and improvement of art itself," Churaki said.

    The conversation shifted to the essential differences between Soviet art and bourgeois art, touching on the fundamental reasons for the corruption and degeneration of bourgeois art. Churaki said that bourgeois art does not aim to win the love of the broad masses of people, but looks down on the people, is divorced from the people, and does not express the advanced ideas and healthy emotions of the people, and as a result, it becomes a formalistic pastime. Such stuff certainly has no future for development. Secondly, bourgeois art, in contrast to Soviet art, despises national characteristics, does not respect the artistic treasures of each nation, and obliterates the nationality of art. Detaching oneself from the life of the people and abolishing the national artistic tradition is tantamount to destroying the foundation for the development of any art.

    When talking about the issue of accepting outstanding national artistic heritage, Comrade Churaki said bluntly: "This is the most fundamental issue in the Soviet art world." He said that the Soviet art world's attitude towards artistic heritage is entirely based on respect. Without heritage, it is impossible to build today's art; promoting the excellent artistic traditions of the past is necessary for the development of today's art, otherwise the so-called new art is just a castle in the sand. Formalists deny artistic heritage and national forms. They flaunt "new forms" that no one understands, but the people do not need this kind of thing. "Artistic heritage is ultimately created by the people, and denying heritage is denying the people!" He concluded the conversation on this issue in this way.

    Comrade Churaki's remarks on Sino-Soviet friendship and cultural exchanges between the two countries gave great enlightenment and encouragement to China's cultural and artistic circles. He said that the common goals of China and the Soviet Union guarantee the growing development and consolidation of the friendship between the two countries, and guarantee the increasing expansion of cultural exchanges between the two countries. This is of great help to the cultural life of the two peoples and to world lasting peace. The mutual visits of delegations from the two countries continuously promote mutual understanding between the two peoples. "For example, our visit here to participate in the 'Sino-Soviet Friendship Month' activities is an important way to develop and consolidate the friendship between the two peoples." He said that the Soviet people love the art of the new China. The Moscow Cultural Palace held two large-scale Chinese music concerts in the music hall that can accommodate 15,000 people during the "Chinese Music Festival" (July 17). Many Soviet composers are studying Chinese music and creating pieces about the new China. For example, Kolchimarev recently created a piece called "Liberated China."

    "The experiences of all aspects of the Soviet art world are very useful to the art world of the new China," Comrade Churaki continued. "For example, the Soviet art world made mistakes in the past in accepting national heritage and developing national forms, but later corrected them. With this experience, the Chinese art world can avoid making mistakes again. This is help. It is necessary to develop national forms. Without national forms, it is impossible to create works that are loved by the broad masses of people."

    The night before the reporters interviewed him, Comrade Churaki watched a Chinese old opera and was very interested. "The expressive methods of Chinese old opera are expressive methods accumulated over hundreds of years," he said. "Of course, to express modern life and characters, old art forms should be appropriately transformed and improved, but this form should never be fundamentally abandoned, because this form is loved by the Chinese people. Such a special art form as China is rare in the world and should be fully respected. I say again, this form should be developed, not abandoned. The task placed before the new Chinese art workers is very arduous. If such an ancient country with such a rich artistic heritage is studied well, it will definitely be able to absorb many things from the past art treasures. Of course, the creation of a new art in a country is impossible in an isolated state. The arts of various countries must influence each other in their development, and should absorb things from the excellent arts of other countries that are conducive to the creation of the new art of their own country. But one must never mechanically imitate foreign art, and one must absorb foreign things on the basis of one's own national artistic tradition to enrich one's own art treasure. The new art of China must have Chinese national characteristics."

    There were many more questions to ask Comrade Churaki, but time did not allow it. Even in this conversation of less than two hours, Comrade Churaki not only improved our understanding of Soviet culture and art, but also further strengthened our confidence in the development of our own national culture and art. In order to better implement the literary and artistic line of our people's leader Mao Zedong and accelerate the development of the people's art of the new China, we must learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet art world in a down-to-earth manner. How much inspiration Comrade Churaki's remarks have given us! (Attached picture)
