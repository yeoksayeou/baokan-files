    The Friendship of the Soviet and Chinese Peoples—A Solid Pillar of Peace and Security in the Far East and the World
    Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Aobalin
    On October 1st this year, the Chinese people celebrated the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with great excitement. Its friends all over the world, all those who watch the achievements of the young People's Republic of China with concern and sympathy, also celebrated this historic day with the great Chinese people.
    The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, concluded in 1950, particularly demonstrated the greatness of the Leninist-Stalinist principles of Soviet foreign policy and the fraternal affection of the Soviet people for the Chinese people. The friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and China has been further consolidated by the recent agreement on the Chinese Changchun Railway and Lushunkou (Port Arthur).
    The fraternal alliance between the people of the Soviet Union and China is a powerful force in consolidating the cause of world peace. In his congratulatory telegram to Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, on the seventh anniversary of the victory over Japanese imperialism, Stalin wrote: "The great friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of Chinа is a reliable guarantee against the threat of new aggression and a strong bulwark of peace in the Far East and the world."
    The victory of the Chinese people's democratic system has created unlimited possibilities for the development of domestic economy and culture. Chinese science, which serves the people, is also developing smoothly. Chinese scientists, together with their people, are successfully building a new life, and they are making their research work serve the national economy and helping the national economy to recover and develop. The Chinese Academy of Sciences plays an important role and has made great achievements in various fields of scientific work.
    A year ago, I accompanied the Soviet People's Observation Delegation to China to participate in the grand celebration of the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, which was truly a magnificent celebration.
    Visiting China and many Chinese scientific institutions, and getting to know many Chinese scientists, gave me a deep impression. My short stay in this great and friendly country has convinced me that Chinese natural science is at a high level. The work of Chinese scientists is of great interest to and attracts the attention of Soviet scientists. The work of Chinese universities and colleges also gave me the best impression.
    Our scientists are full of friendly feelings towards the Chinese people, and our scientists are happy to exchange their knowledge and experience with Chinese scientists, help Chinese scientists to become more familiar with the achievements of Soviet science more quickly and completely, study the basic principles of the Soviet scientific organization, and apply the achievements of Soviet science and technology in the development of China's national economy.
    We are very pleased with the fact that Chinese scientists have a strong interest in Soviet science. Soviet science, which serves the people, helps to more fully develop and better use the resources and forces of nature that are beneficial to the people. Soviet science, based on Marxist-Leninist theory, is the most advanced science in the world, and Soviet Michurin's biology and Pavlov's physiology are the greatest achievements in world science.
    Our science is developed on the basis of close contact with the practical activities of the broad masses. Soviet scientists solved the problem of liberating atomic energy in a shorter time than American scientists. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Soviet science has achieved comprehensive development and is advancing along an unprecedentedly high road. Experience has proved that, for Soviet science, there is now no technical problem of any magnitude that cannot be solved.
    The cooperation between Soviet and Chinese scientists plays an important role in the cause of developing advanced science. Soviet and Chinese scientists have made great contributions to consolidating the cause of peace and security in the Far East and among the peoples of the world.
    If our science has the mission of promoting the development of the productive forces of our friendly countries, then in the imperialist countries, the ruling groups are using science to prepare for war and the massacre of mankind.
    As a biochemist, I cannot but express extreme indignation at the appalling crimes of the American imperialists in conducting bacteriological warfare to massacre the peaceful residents of Korea on a large scale.
    The "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" can more closely consolidate the ties between the people of our two countries and will help to establish a more solid relationship between scientists of the Soviet Union and China.
    Long live the great Chinese people and their outstanding leader Mao Zedong!
    May the friendship of the Soviet and Chinese peoples—a solid pillar of peace and security in the Far East and the world—be consolidated and developed!
    Long live the wise leader of all progressive mankind—the great Stalin!

### 苏中人民的友谊——远东及世界和平与安全的牢固支柱

    苏中人民的友谊——远东及世界和平与安全的牢固支柱
    苏联科学院院士  奥巴林
    今年十月一日，中国人民非常兴奋地庆祝中华人民共和国成立的三周年。它的全世界的朋友们，所有那些关心地和同情地注视着年轻的中华人民共和国的成就的人们，也都和伟大的中国人民一起，来庆祝这个历史性的日子。
    在一九五○年所缔结的中苏友好同盟互助条约中，特别显示出苏联外交政策的列宁—斯大林的原则的伟大，表现出苏联人民对中国人民的兄弟般的亲切友爱。苏中之间的友谊与合作，由于不久以前关于中国长春铁路和旅顺口的协定而愈益巩固了。
    苏中两国人民的兄弟般的同盟，是巩固全世界和平事业中的强大力量。斯大林同志在战胜日本帝国主义七周年纪念日给中国人民领袖毛泽东同志的贺电中写道：“苏联和中华人民共和国之间的伟大友谊是反对新侵略威胁的可靠保证，是远东及全世界和平的坚强堡垒。”
    中国人民民主制度的胜利，为发展国内经济和文化创造了无限的可能性。为人民服务的中国科学也在顺利地发展着。中国科学家和自己的人民一起，成功地建设着新的生活，他们使自己的研究工作服务于国民经济，帮助国民经济的复兴和发展。中国科学院起着重大的作用，它在科学工作的各种领域中都获得了巨大的成就。
    一年前，我曾随苏联人民观礼代表团到中国参加了庆祝中华人民共和国成立两周年的盛典，那真是一次雄伟的庆祝大会。
    访问中国和访问中国的许多科学机关，我和许多中国科学家们相识，给了我很深的印象。在这个伟大和友好的国家里的短期的停留，已使我确信，中国的自然科学是处于一种高度的水平上的。中国科学家的工作使苏联科学家感到很大的兴趣，并引起苏联科学家的注意。中国高等学校的工作，也给了我最良好的印象。
    我国科学家对中国人民充满了友谊的感情，我国科学家愉快地与中国科学家交换自己的知识和经验，帮助中国科学家更快地和更完全地熟习苏联科学的成就，研究苏联科学组织的基本原则，在发展中国国民经济中运用苏联科学和技术的成就。
    我们十分乐于中国科学家对苏联科学有着浓厚兴趣这一事实。为人民服务的苏联科学，帮助更充分地开发和更好地使用有利于人民的富源和自然的力量。以马克思列宁主义理论为基础的苏联科学，是世界上最先进的科学，苏联米丘林的生物学和巴甫洛夫的生理学是世界科学中最伟大的成就。
    我们的科学是在与广大群众的实际活动密切联系的基础上发展起来的。苏联科学家在比美国科学家还短的时间内解决了解放原子能的问题。在苏联共产党的领导下，苏联科学获得了全面的发展，并沿着空前高涨的道路前进。经验证明，对于苏联的科学来说，现在没有不能解决的任何规模的技术问题。
    苏联科学家和中国科学家的合作，在发展先进科学的事业中起着重要的作用。苏联科学家和中国科学家给巩固远东和世界各族人民的和平与安全事业作了巨大的供献。
    如果我们的科学负有促进我们友好国家的生产力发展的使命的话，那么在帝国主义国家里，统治集团却使科学为准备战争和屠杀人类而服务。
    作为一个生物化学家，我对于进行细菌战以大量屠杀朝鲜和平居民的美帝国主义者的骇人听闻的罪行，不能不表示极端的愤怒。
    “中苏友好月”能够更紧密地巩固我们两国人民之间的联系，并将有助于建立中苏两国科学家之间的更加牢固的联系。
    伟大的中国人民及其杰出领袖毛泽东万岁！
    祝苏中人民的友谊——远东及世界和平与安全的牢固支柱巩固和发展！
    全体进步人类的英明领袖——伟大的斯大林万岁！
