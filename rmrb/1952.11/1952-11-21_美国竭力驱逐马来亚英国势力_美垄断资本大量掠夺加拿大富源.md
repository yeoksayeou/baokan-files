Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th (TASS dispatch): "Red Star" published an article on the efforts of American capitalists to expel British forces from Malaya. The author, Leontiev, wrote: After Wall Street magnates monopolized the export trade of rubber and tin in Malaya, they immediately attempted to seize Britain's economic position in Malaya. To this end, they have deliberately lowered the prices of rubber and tin several times recently, regardless of Britain's strong protests. Due to the many speculative conspiracies carried out by the U.S. side, the price of tin in Malaya has been reduced by almost half, and the price of rubber has been reduced from six shillings per pound to one shilling and ten pence. Malaya produces more than 600,000 tons of rubber and about 50,000 tons of tin annually. It is easy to see how severely the American "friends" have hit their British partners.

Not only that, as a result of lowering prices, the American monopoly capitalist groups have been able to acquire many Malayan rubber plantations and tin mines, thus squeezing out their competitors to a considerable extent.

The Americans are particularly interested in Singapore, the large British naval base which is now gradually becoming a key point for the military and economic penetration of the United States into Malaya.

Recently, Japanese businessmen backed by Wall Street monopoly capitalists have appeared in Malaya. Japanese companies controlled by the Americans are also coveting Malaya's huge resources. All this proves that the United States is increasingly stepping up its economic and military penetration into Malaya.

Leontiev concluded: The people of Malaya hate both American and British colonialists equally. The American "Life" magazine had to admit that Americans are very unpopular in Malaya and that they are risking being killed there.

This situation also proves that the people of Malaya are intensifying their struggle to liberate themselves from the oppression of the imperialist enslavers.

Xinhua News Agency, Ottawa, 16th (TASS dispatch): American monopoly capitalists have shown increasing interest in the oil discovered in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and other Canadian provinces after the war. They are trying to seize all of Canada's oil and other natural resources.

According to the Canadian progressive press, by the end of 1951, oil companies (mostly American-owned) had leased approximately 160 million acres of land in the western provinces of Canada.

The Canadian Forum pointed out that among the American companies that have seized control of Canadian oil, Imperial Oil Limited, a subsidiary of Standard Oil of New Jersey, ranks first. Other American companies mentioned by the newspaper include: Gulf Oil Corporation, Standard Oil of California, Mobil Oil Corporation, Texaco, Phillips Petroleum Company, Superior Oil Company, and Union Oil Company of California.

Imperial Oil Limited alone "leased" more than 21 million acres of land in Alberta, which is larger than the entire cultivated area of the province. American monopoly capitalists hold 75 percent of the shares of Imperial Oil Limited. Not long ago, the company completed an oil pipeline from Edmonton (Alberta) to Superior (Wisconsin), USA.

It is most noteworthy that the pipeline was laid to the United States instead of to the eastern provinces of Canada, which urgently need oil. As a result, the eastern provinces of Canada have to buy oil products from the United States at high prices. The Canadian government has also allowed the construction of another oil pipeline to the Pacific coast of the United States.

After seizing Canada's oil wealth, American monopoly capitalists do not expand oil production, but only seek to meet their own needs.

The United States has also seized Canada's natural gas, mainly natural gas from Alberta. This gas should have been used for heating or other purposes for Canadian families, or to develop Canadian industry, but the United States uses this gas for the war industry in Montana. Alberta's natural gas is completely occupied by three American companies.

### 美国竭力驱逐马来亚英国势力  美垄断资本大量掠夺加拿大富源

    美国竭力驱逐马来亚英国势力
    美垄断资本大量掠夺加拿大富源
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十六日电：“红星报”刊载了一篇关于美国资本家力图将英国势力逐出马来亚的文章。作者里昂捷夫写道：华尔街豪门垄断了马来亚橡胶和锡的出口贸易以后，又立刻图谋夺取英国在马来亚的经济地位。为了这个目的，他们近来好几次故意压低了橡胶和锡的价格，不顾英国的强烈抗议。由于美国方面进行了多次的投机性的阴谋措施，马来亚锡的价格已差不多压低了一半，橡胶的价格已从每磅六先令减低到一先令十辨士。马来亚每年出产橡胶六十多万吨、锡约五万吨。很容易看到：美国“朋友”使英国伙伴受到了多么惨重的打击。
    不但这样，压低了价格的结果，美国垄断资本家集团更有了能够收购许多马来亚橡胶园和锡矿的条件，这样就在相当大的范围内把他们的竞争对象排挤出去了。
    美国人对新加坡特别感到兴趣，那个英国的大海军基地现在正逐渐变成美国在军事上和经济上渗入马来亚的重点。
    近来以华尔街垄断资本家为后台老板的日本商人已在马来亚出现。美国人控制的日本公司也垂涎着马来亚的巨大富源。这一切都证明了美国日益加紧在经济上和军事上渗入马来亚。
    里昂捷夫最后写道：马来亚人民对美英两国殖民者都同样痛恨。美国“生活”杂志不得不承认：美国人在马来亚是很不受欢迎的人物，而且他们在那儿也冒着被杀死的危险。
    这一种情势也证明：马来亚人民为了要从帝国主义奴役者的压迫下获得解放，正加紧进行他们的斗争。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社渥太华十六日电：美国垄断资本家对于战后在阿尔伯达、萨斯喀彻温、曼尼托巴、以及其他加拿大省份所发现的石油，表示了愈来愈大的兴趣。他们企图攫取所有加拿大的石油以及其他天然资源。
    据加拿大进步报纸说，到一九五一年年底，石油公司（大部属于美国）在加拿大西部省份所租用的土地达到一亿六千万亩左右。
    加拿大论坛报指出在夺得加拿大石油控制权的美国公司中间，新泽西美孚油公司的附属公司帝国石油有限公司占第一位。该报所提到的其他美国公司有：海湾石油公司，加利福尼亚美孚油公司，美孚油公司，得克萨斯石油公司，菲利浦石油公司，苏必利尔石油公司，以及加利福尼亚联合石油公司等。
    单单帝国石油有限公司就在阿尔伯达“租了”二千一百余万亩的土地，比该省整个耕地面积还要大。美国垄断资本家握有帝国石油有限公司百分之七十五的股票。不久以前，该公司完成了一条由埃德蒙吞（阿尔伯达省）到美国苏必利尔（威斯康星州）的石油管。
    最令人注意的是该管铺设到美国而不铺设到加拿大东部数省急需石油的地方，这样，加拿大东部各省就不得不用高价向美国购买石油产品。加拿大政府还允许再建造一条油管通到美国的太平洋海岸。
    美国垄断资本家在夺得加拿大的石油财富之后，并不扩大石油的生产，只求满足他们自己的需要。
    美国还攫取了加拿大的天然煤气，主要是阿尔伯达省的天然煤气。这些煤气本应当供加拿大的家庭作取暖或其他用途，或用来发展加拿大工业，可是美国却把这些煤气用到蒙大拿州的战争工业上去。阿尔伯达的天然煤气完全被三家美国公司占有了。
