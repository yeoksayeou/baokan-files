Editor's Note: On page three of this newspaper on August 24, we published the draft amendments to the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This draft, after heated discussions and revisions and supplements by a special committee at the 19th Congress of the CPSU, has been approved by the Congress as the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In order to enable our readers to accurately study the new Party Constitution of the CPSU, we are now re-translating and publishing the full text of this Party Constitution here.

Chapter 1. The Party, Party Members, and the Obligations and Rights of Party Members

Article 1. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a voluntary fighting alliance of like-minded communists from the working class, laboring peasants, and laboring intellectuals.

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union organized the alliance of the working class and laboring peasants, overthrew the rule of capitalists and landlords through the Great October Socialist Revolution of 1917, established the dictatorship of the proletariat, eliminated capitalism, eradicated the exploitation of man by man, and ensured the establishment of a socialist society.

Currently, the main tasks of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union are: to build a communist society through the gradual transition from socialism to communism, to continuously improve the material and cultural level of society, to educate members of society with the spirit of internationalism and brotherly relations with the working people of all countries, and to strive to strengthen the active defense of the Soviet motherland to prevent enemy aggression.

Article 2. Any Soviet citizen who engages in labor, does not exploit the labor of others, recognizes the Party Program and Constitution, actively promotes their realization, works in a Party organization, and implements all Party resolutions can become a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Party members must pay the prescribed Party dues.

Article 3. Party members have the following obligations:

(1) To do their utmost to safeguard the unity of the Party, because the unity of the Party is the main condition for the Party's strength and power;

(2) To actively struggle for the realization of the Party's resolutions. It is not enough for a Party member to merely agree with the Party's resolutions; a Party member has the obligation to fight for the realization of these resolutions. A communist's passive or lip-service attitude towards the Party's resolutions inevitably weakens the Party's combat effectiveness and is therefore incompatible with remaining in the Party's ranks;

(3) To play a model role in labor, master professional skills, continuously improve production or professional skills, and strive to protect and consolidate the socialist public ownership, the sacred and inviolable foundation of the Soviet system;

(4) To strengthen ties with the masses daily, promptly reflect the demands and needs of the working people, explain the Party's policies and resolutions to the non-Party masses, and always remember that the Party's strength and invincibility lie in its inseparable flesh-and-blood ties with the people;

(5) To strive to raise their awareness and understand the foundations of Marxism-Leninism;

(6) To abide by Party and state discipline, without exception for any Party member. There cannot be two kinds of discipline within the Party, one for leaders and one for ordinary members. The Party has only one discipline, one law, which all communists, regardless of their merits and positions, must abide by. Violating Party and state discipline is a serious offense that harms the Party and is therefore incompatible with remaining in the Party's ranks;

(7) To carry out self-criticism and criticism from below, expose shortcomings in work and strive to eliminate them, oppose superficial achievements, and oppose complacency with achievements in work. Suppressing criticism is a serious offense. Anyone who stifles criticism, is arrogant, and likes flattery cannot remain in the Party's ranks;

(8) To report shortcomings in work to the Party's leading organs, up to the Party's Central Committee, regardless of who is involved. Party members have no right to conceal unsatisfactory situations or ignore incorrect actions that harm the interests of the Party and the state. Anyone who obstructs a Party member from fulfilling this obligation should be severely punished as someone who violates the Party's will;

(9) To be loyal and honest to the Party, and not to conceal or distort the truth. A communist's disloyalty to the Party and deception of the Party are extremely serious offenses and are incompatible with remaining in the Party's ranks;

(10) To guard Party and state secrets, maintain political vigilance, and always remember that communists must be vigilant at all times and in all circumstances. Disclosing Party and state secrets is a crime against the Party and is therefore incompatible with remaining in the Party's ranks;

(11) In any position entrusted by the Party, to resolutely implement the Party's instructions on correctly selecting cadres based on political qualities and professional abilities. Any behavior that violates these instructions and selects personnel based on friendship, personal connections, hometown ties, and family relationships is incompatible with remaining in the Party's ranks.

Article 4. Party members have the following rights:

(1) To participate in free and substantive discussions on Party policy issues at Party meetings or in Party newspapers and periodicals;

(2) To criticize any Party worker at Party meetings;

(3) To elect and be elected to Party organs;

(4) To demand to participate in person when resolutions are passed regarding their activities or conduct;

(5) To raise any questions and make statements to any level of Party organs, up to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Article 5. The admission of Party members shall only be carried out through individual processing procedures. New Party members are admitted from probationary members who have undergone the prescribed probationary period. Conscious, active, and loyal workers, peasants, and intellectuals of the communist cause may be admitted as Party members.

Only those who have reached the age of eighteen can join the Party.

The procedure for converting probationary members into full members is as follows:

(1) Applicants for Party membership must have three introducers who have at least three years of Party membership and have known them for at least one year of common work.

[Note 1] When accepting members of the Communist Youth League into the Party, the introduction of the Communist Youth League District Committee is equivalent to the introduction of one Party Member.

[Note 2] Members and alternate members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union may not act as introducers.

(2) The issue of joining the Party shall be discussed and decided by the general meeting of the Party's primary organization, and its decision shall take effect after being approved by the Party's District Committee, or by the Municipal Committee in cities without districts.

The introducer is not required to attend the discussion of the issue of joining the Party.

(3) Youths aged twenty and under can only join the Party through the Communist Youth League.

(4) Those who have left other political parties to join the Party must have five Party member introducers, three Party members with ten years of Party membership, and two Party members who joined before the revolution, and must go through the Party's primary organization, and must be approved by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Article 6. The introducer is responsible for the qualities of the person they introduce.

Article 7. When a probationary member becomes a full member, their Party membership seniority is calculated from the date when the relevant general meeting of the Party's primary organization passed the resolution to make the comrade a full member.

Article 8. When a member of a Party organization transfers to the work area of another organization, they become a member of the latter.

[Note] The transfer of Party members from one organization to another shall be carried out in accordance with the regulations stipulated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Article 9. Party members and probationary members who fail to pay Party dues for three consecutive months without sufficient reason are considered to have automatically withdrawn from the Party; the Party's primary organization can make a decision on this and submit it to the Party's District Committee or Municipal Committee for approval.

Article 10. The issue of expelling a communist from the Party is decided by the general meeting of the Party's primary organization to which the member belongs and approved by the Party's District Committee or Municipal Committee. The resolution of the District Committee or Municipal Committee on expulsion from the Party is only effective when approved by the Party's Provincial Committee, Regional Committee, or the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Republic.

Before the resolution on expulsion from the Party has been approved by the Provincial Committee, Regional Committee, or Central Committee of the Republic, the Party member may still hold a Party membership card and has the right to attend Party secret meetings.

Article 11. If a communist is a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Republic, a member of the Party's Regional Committee, Provincial Committee, State Committee, Municipal Committee, or District Committee, the Party's primary organization cannot make a resolution to expel them from the Party or transfer them to probationary membership.

The issue of removing a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Republic, a member of the Party's Regional Committee, Provincial Committee, State Committee, Municipal Committee, or District Committee from their position as a committee member, as well as expelling them from the Party or transferring them to probationary membership, is decided by the plenary meeting of the respective committee, if two-thirds of the plenary meeting vote in favor.

Article 12. The issue of removing a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from their position as a Central Committee member, as well as expelling them from the Party or transferring them to probationary membership, is decided by the Party Congress, or, between two Congresses, by the plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union with a two-thirds majority vote of the plenary meeting of the Central Committee. After a Central Committee member is removed from their position, the vacancy is automatically filled by an alternate Central Committee member in the order stipulated by the Congress when electing alternate Central Committee members.

Article 13. When a Party member commits a fault that should be subject to legal punishment, they shall be expelled from the Party, and their fault shall be notified to the administrative and judicial authorities.

Article 14. In deciding the issue of expelling a Party member from the Party, the utmost caution and comradely concern should be maintained, and the basis of the facts of the errors alleged against the Party member should be thoroughly studied.

For minor errors, the methods of Party education and persuasion should be adopted (such as advice, warnings, etc.), rather than expulsion from the Party, because expulsion from the Party is the Party's highest method of punishment.

When necessary, the Party organization can transfer a Party member to probationary membership for a period of up to one year as a method of Party punishment. The resolution of the Party's primary organization on transferring a Party member to probationary membership must be approved by the Party's District Committee or Municipal Committee. When the stipulated period of probationary membership expires, they shall be transferred to full membership in accordance with the general regulations, and their previous Party membership seniority shall be retained.

Article 15. Appeals from those expelled from the Party and the Party organization's resolution on expulsion from the Party should be reviewed by the relevant Party organ no later than twenty days after receiving the appeal and the resolution.

Chapter 2. Probationary Members

Article 16. All those who volunteer to join the Party must undergo a probationary period to allow probationary members to become familiar with the Party Program, Party Constitution, Party tactics, and to allow the Party organization to examine the personal qualities of the probationary member.

Article 17. The procedures for accepting probationary members (individual acceptance, submitting introductions and reviewing introductions, the primary organization's resolution on acceptance into the Party, and the approval of this resolution) are exactly the same as for accepting Party members.

Article 18. The probationary period is set at one year.

The Party organization must help probationary members prepare to join the Party. At the end of the probationary period, the Party organization should address the issue of the probationary member at a Party meeting. If the probationary member has failed to reach the level required for Party membership for some reason, and the Party organization believes that these reasons are valid, the Party's primary organization can extend their probationary period, but not by more than one year. If, during the probationary period, it is found that the probationary member is not suitable for acceptance into the Party due to their personal qualities, the Party organization can decide to cancel their probationary membership. The resolution of the Party's primary organization on extending the probationary period or canceling probationary membership is only effective after being approved by the Party's District Committee or Municipal Committee.

Article 19. Probationary members participate in the meetings of the organization to which they belong and have the right to speak.

Article 20. Probationary members pay ordinary Party dues to the local Party committee.

Chapter 3. Party Structure. Intra-Party Democracy

Article 21. The guiding principle of the Party's organizational structure is democratic centralism, which means:

(1) All leading organs of the Party, from the lowest to the highest, are elected;

(2) Party organs report on their work to their Party organizations on a regular basis;

(3) Strict observance of Party discipline and subordination of the minority to the majority;

(4) Subordinate organs are absolutely subordinate to the decisions of higher-level organs.

Article 22. The Party is established according to the principles of region and production: the Party organization in a certain region is the superior organization for all partial regional Party organizations in that region; the Party organization of an entire work department is the superior organization for the Party organizations of each institution in that work department.

Article 23. All Party organizations have the right to make autonomous decisions on local issues, but these decisions must not contradict the decisions of the Party.

Article 24. The highest leading organ of each Party organization is the Party Congress (for primary organizations), the Representative Meeting (for example, for district organizations, provincial organizations), and the Representative Congress (for the Communist Parties of the Republics and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union).

Article 25. The general meeting of all Party members, the Representative Meeting, or the Representative Congress elects a standing committee or committee, which is their executive organ and leads all the daily work of the organization.

Article 26. When electing Party organs, voting by the entire list of candidates is prohibited. Voting should be conducted on individual candidates, ensuring that each Party member has the unrestricted right to withdraw candidates and criticize candidates. Elections shall be conducted by secret ballot.

Article 27. In the centers of cities and districts, meetings of activists of city and district Party organizations should be convened to discuss important decisions of the Party and the government. The convening of activist meetings should not be a mere formality, formally and ritually approving these decisions, but should be for the purpose of truly discussing these decisions.

Article 28. Free and substantive discussion of Party policy issues within individual organizations or throughout the Party is an inalienable right of every Party member under the intra-Party democratic system. Only on the basis of intra-Party democracy can self-criticism be carried out and Party discipline be consolidated, and Party discipline should be conscious, not mechanical.

However, broad discussions on Party policy issues, especially nationwide discussions, should be properly organized to prevent attempts by a very small number of people to force the Party's majority to submit to their will, or attempts to form factions that undermine the Party's unity, or to create divisive attempts that could shake the strength and consolidation of the socialist system.

A broad, nationwide discussion can only be considered necessary in the following circumstances:

(1) Such necessity must be recognized by at least several provincial or republic-level local Party organizations;

(2) Within the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, there is not a sufficiently strong majority on the most important Party policy issues;

(3) Although there is a strong majority within the Central Committee that adheres to a certain viewpoint, the Central Committee still considers it necessary to hold intra-Party discussions to check the correctness of its policies.

Only by observing these conditions can the Party be protected from anti-Party elements abusing intra-Party democracy; only under these conditions can it be expected that intra-Party democracy will be beneficial to the cause and will not be used to harm the Party and the working class.

Chapter 4. The Party's Highest Organs

Article 29. The highest organ of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the Party Congress. The Congress shall be convened at least once every four years.

    苏联共产党党章
    编者按：本报八月二十四日的第三版，曾刊登苏联共产党关于党章的修正草案。这个草案经过联共第十九次代表大会的热烈讨论和专门委员会的修正与补充，业已由代表大会批准作为苏联共产党党章。为了使我国读者能够准确地研读联共的新党章，我们现在再把这个党章的全文译出发表在这里。第一章党。党员和党员的义务与权利
    第一条  苏联共产党是工人阶级、劳动农民和劳动知识分子中思想一致的共产主义者所组成的自愿的战斗联盟。
    苏联共产党组织了工人阶级和劳动农民的联盟，经过一九一七年伟大的十月社会主义革命，推翻了资本家和地主的政权，建立了无产阶级专政，肃清了资本主义，消灭了人对人的剥削并保证了社会主义社会的建立。
    现在，苏联共产党的主要任务是：通过由社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的途径来建立共产主义社会，不断提高社会的物质和文化水平，用国际主义及与各国劳动人民建立兄弟般联系的精神来教育社会成员，竭力加强苏维埃祖国的积极防御，以防止敌人的侵略行动。
    第二条  任何从事劳动、不剥削他人劳动的苏联公民，凡承认党纲党章、积极促其实现、在党的一个组织中工作并执行党的一切决议者，均得成为苏联共产党党员。
    党员必须缴纳规定的党费。
    第三条  党员有下列义务：
    （一）尽力卫护党的统一，因为党的统一是党强大有力的主要条件；
    （二）为实现党的决议而积极斗争。对于党员来说，仅仅同意党的决议是不够的，党员有义务为实现这些决议而奋斗。共产党员对党的决议采取消极的阳奉阴违的态度，就必然会削弱党的战斗力，因此，与留在党的队伍内不能相容；
    （三）在劳动中起模范作用，精通业务，不断提高生产或业务技能，尽力爱护和巩固社会主义公有制这一苏维埃制度神圣不可侵犯的基础；
    （四）每日加强与群众的联系，及时反映劳动者的要求和需要，向非党群众解释党的政策和决议，时时记住我党之所以有力量和不可战胜就在于它和人民有不可分割的血肉联系；
    （五）努力提高自己的觉悟，领会马克思列宁主义基础；
    （六）遵守党和国家的纪律，一切党员均无例外。党内不能有两种纪律，一种是对领导人的纪律，一种是对普通党员的纪律。党只有一种纪律，一种法律，一切共产党员不管他们的功绩和职位如何，均应遵守。破坏党和国家的纪律，是损害党的严重恶行，因此，与留在党的队伍内不能相容；
    （七）开展自我批评和自下而上的批评，揭露工作中的缺点并努力加以消灭，反对表面成绩，反对满足于工作中的成就。压制批评是严重的恶行。凡是窒息批评，自高自大，喜欢奉承的人，都不能留在党的队伍里；
    （八）向党的领导机关直至党的中央委员会报告工作中的缺点，不管报告牵涉到什么人。党员无权隐瞒不能令人满意的情况和不过问损害党和国家利益的不正确行动。凡是妨碍党员履行这项义务的人应作为违背党的意志的人而予以严惩；
    （九）对党忠诚老实，不隐瞒和歪曲事实真相。共产党员不忠实于党和欺骗党，是极严重的恶行，与留在党的队伍内不能相容；
    （十）保守党和国家的机密，保持政治警惕性，时时记住共产党员在任何地方任何情况下都必须保持警惕。泄露党和国家的机密，就是对党犯罪，因而与留在党的队伍内不能相容；
    （十一）在党所托付的任何岗位上，坚决执行党关于按照政治品质和业务能力正确挑选干部的指示。凡是违背这种指示，按照朋友关系、私人情面、同乡和亲戚关系挑选工作人员的行为，都与留在党的队伍内不能相容。
    第四条  党员有下列权利：
    （一）在党的会议上或在党的报刊上参加党的政策问题的自由的、切实的讨论；
    （二）在党的会议上批评党的任何工作人员；
    （三）选举和被选举到党的机关；
    （四）凡在通过关于自己的活动或行为的决议时，要求亲自参加；
    （五）向党的任何一级机关直到苏联共产党中央委员会提出任何问题和声明。
    第五条  接收党员只能按照个别处理的手续进行。新党员是从经过了规定的候补期的候补党员接收的。觉悟的、积极的、忠于共产主义事业的工人、农民和知识分子得接收为党员。
    年满十八岁者始能入党。
    接收候补党员为正式党员的手续如下：
    （一）申请入党者，要有三个至少有三年党龄并至少在一年共同工作中认识的党员的介绍。
    〔附注一〕接受共产主义青年团团员入党时，共产主义青年团区委员会的介绍等于一个党员的介绍。
    〔附注二〕苏联共产党中央委员和候补中央委员不得介绍。
    （二）入党问题由党的基层组织全体大会讨论和决定，其决定，经党的区委员会批准，在没有区的城市由市委员会批准，即发生效力。
    在讨论入党问题时，介绍人不一定出席。
    （三）二十岁和二十岁以下的青年入党只能经过共产主义青年团。
    （四）脱离其他政党的人入党要有五个党员介绍，三个有十年党龄的党员，两个革命以前入党的党员，并且非经过党的基层组织不可，同时必须苏联共产党中央委员会批准。
    第六条  介绍人要对他所介绍的人的品质负责。
    第七条  候补党员转为正式党员，其党龄从有关的党的基层组织全体大会通过该同志为正式党员的决议之日算起。
    第八条  一个党组织的任何党员转到另一组织的工作地区时，即为后者的党员。
    〔附注〕党员从一个组织转到另一个组织，须按照苏联共产党中央委员会规定的条例进行。
    第九条  党员和候补党员，没有充分理由连续三个月不缴纳党费，即被认为自动脱党；党的基层组织对此可作出决定，交党的区委员会或市委员会批准。
    第十条  开除一个共产党员党籍的问题由该党员所属的党的基层组织全体大会决定，并由党的区委员会或市委员会批准。区委员会或市委员会关于开除党籍的决议，只有在党的省委员会、边区委员会或加盟共和国共产党中央委员会批准时，方始有效。
    开除党籍的决议，未经省委员会、边区委员会或加盟共和国中央委员会批准之前，该党员仍可持有党证，并有权出席党的秘密会议。
    第十一条  如果一个共产党员是苏联共产党中央委员、加盟共和国共产党中央委员、党的边区委员会委员、省委员会委员、州委员会委员、市委员会委员、区委员会委员，党的基层组织不能作出将他开除党籍或转为候补党员的决议。
    撤销加盟共和国共产党中央委员、党的边区委员会委员、省委员会委员、州委员会委员、市委员会委员、区委员会委员的委员职务以及将其开除党籍或转为候补党员的问题，由各该委员会的全体会议决定，如果全体会议三分之二的人投票赞成的话。
    第十二条  撤销苏联共产党中央委员的中委职务以及将其开除党籍或转为候补党员的问题由党的代表大会决定，而在两次代表大会之间则由苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议以中央委员会全体会议三分之二的多数决定。一个中央委员撤销职务后，遗缺由候补中央委员按照代表大会在选举候补中央委员时所规定的顺序自行递补。
    第十三条  一个党员犯有应受法律处分的过错时，即予开除党籍，并将其过错通知行政当局和司法当局。
    第十四条  在决定开除一个党员党籍的问题时，应保持最大的慎重和同志的关切，并透彻研究对该党员提出的错误事实的根据。
    对于小的过错，应当采用党的教育和感化的方法（如劝告、警告等等），而不要开除党籍，因为开除党籍是党的最高的处罚方法。
    在必要的情况下，党的组织可以把一个党员转为候补党员，为期可以多达一年，作为党的处罚方法。党的基层组织关于将一个党员转为候补党员的决议，必须经过党的区委员会或市委员会批准。转为候补党员的规定期限届满时，按一般规定转为正式党员，其以往的党龄仍予保留。
    第十五条  被开除党籍者的申诉书以及党组织关于开除党籍的决议应当由有关的党的机关审阅，至迟应在收到申诉书和决议后二十天内审阅。
    第二章  候补党员
    第十六条  凡志愿入党者，都须经过候补期，以使候补党员熟悉党纲、党章、党的策略，并使党的组织得以考察候补党员个人的品质。
    第十七条  接收候补党员的手续（个别接收、呈缴介绍书及审查介绍书、基层组织关于接收入党的决议以及这个决议的批准）同接收党员是完全一样的。
    第十八条  候补期定为一年。
    党组织必须帮助候补党员准备入党。在候补期届满时，党组织应在党的会议上处理候补党员的问题。如果候补党员由于某些原因未能达到入党水平，而这些原因党组织认为可以成立，则党的基层组织可以延长他的候补期，但不得超过一年。如果在候补期间发现候补党员由于个人的品质不宜接收入党，党组织可决定取消他的候补党员资格。党的基层组织关于延长候补期或取消候补党员资格的决议，经过党的区委员会或市委员会批准后，方始有效。
    第十九条  候补党员参加他所属的组织的会议，有发言权。
    第二十条  候补党员向当地党委员会缴纳普通党费。
    第三章  党的结构。党内民主
    第二十一条    党的组织结构的指导原则是民主集中制，这就是说：
    （一）党的一切领导机关，由最低的到最高的，都是选举出来的；
    （二）党的机关向自己党的组织作定期的工作报告；
    （三）严格遵守党的纪律和少数服从多数；
    （四）下级机关绝对服从上级机关的决议。
    第二十二条  党是按照地区和生产的原则建立起来的：某地区的党组织，对于该地区的一切部分地区的党组织，是上级组织；整个工作部门的党组织，对于该工作部门的各机构的党组织，是上级组织。
    第二十三条  一切党组织对于地方性的问题有自主决定的权利，但这些决定不得与党的决定相抵触。
    第二十四条  每个党组织的最高领导机关是党员大会（对于基层组织）、代表会议（例如，对于区的组织、省的组织）、代表大会（对于加盟共和国共产党和苏联共产党）。
    第二十五条  全体党员大会、代表会议或代表大会选举常务委员会或委员会，这是它们的执行机关，并领导该组织的一切日常工作。
    第二十六条  在选举党的机关时，禁止按整个候选名单投票。应当按个别候选人投票，保证每一个党员有无限制的权利撤销候选人和批评候选人。应用秘密投票的方法进行选举。
    第二十七条  在城市和区的中心，应召开城市和区的党组织的活动分子会议，讨论党和政府的重要决议。活动分子会议的召开不应是为了做做样子，在形式上和仪式上赞同这些决议，而是为了真正讨论这些决议。
    第二十八条  在个别组织内或在全党内自由而切实地讨论党的政策问题，是每个党员根据党内民主制所应有的不可剥夺的权利。只有在党内民主制的基础上才能够开展自我批评和巩固党的纪律，党的纪律应当是自觉的，而不是机械的。
    但是关于党的政策问题的广泛讨论，特别是全苏联范围的讨论，应当加以适当组织，以防止极少数人强迫党内大多数人服从他们意志的企图，或是成立破坏党的统一的派别的企图，或是制造可能动摇社会主义制度的力量和巩固性的分裂企图。
    全苏联范围的广泛的讨论，只有在下列情形下才能认为是必要的：
    （一）这种必要至少须为几个省或共和国一级的地方党组织所承认；
    （二）在苏联共产党中央委员会内，在最重要的党的政策问题上，没有足够有力的大多数；
    （三）中央委员会内虽有坚持一定观点的有力的大多数，但是中央委员会仍认为有必要举行党内讨论来检查自己政策的正确性。
    只有遵守这些条件，才能卫护党而不让反党分子滥用党内民主；只有在这些条件下，才能指望党内民主有利于事业，而不会被利用来损害党和工人阶级。
    第四章  党的高级机关
    第二十九条  苏联共产党的最高机关是党代表大会。代表大会至少每四年召集一次。非常代表大会，由党中央委员会自己发起，或根据上次党代表大会所代表的全体党员至少三分之一的要求，由党中央委员会召集之。党代表大会的召集及其议程，至迟应在代表大会前一个半月宣布。非常代表大会应在两个月内召集。
