Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 19th. The leaders of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army twice sent telegrams to the commanders and fighters of the combat troops on the Shangganling front north of Jinhua, commending and congratulating them on their brilliant victory in the staunch defensive battle. In their first commendation telegram, the leaders of the Volunteer Army said: "In the thirteen days and nights from October 14th to 26th, you carried out a tenacious defensive battle and active counter-attacks, annihilating more than 8,000 enemy troops from the US 7th Division and the puppet 2nd Division, stopping the enemy's advance, and holding the position. This staunch spirit of fighting for peace is highly commendable. We hope you will continue your efforts to completely smash the enemy's offensive." In their second commendation telegram, the leaders of the Volunteer Army said: "You have fought fiercely with the enemy for more than twenty days. The enemy concentrated unprecedented superior firepower, aircraft, and tanks, and launched group charges with a large number of infantry. As a result, they not only failed to capture your positions but also lost more than 18,000 men (Note: The enemy's losses have now increased to over 20,000) and a large number of artillery shells. In the fierce battle, you highly displayed a tenacious and unyielding fighting style. You fought stronger as you fought, your tactics became more and more flexible, and the coordination between infantry and artillery became closer and closer. If you continue to fight like this, you will surely be able to kill the enemy."

    Encouraged by the commendation telegrams, the infantry and artillery units of the Volunteer Army fighting on the Shangganling front have further promoted their spirit of heroic and tenacious combat. On the afternoon of October 27th, the gunners of the 9th company of a certain regiment of the artillery unit immediately engaged in the battle to destroy the enemy's artillery group after reading the commendation telegram. Under the slogan of "Use new victories to answer the honor given to us by the leaders," the gunners launched a fierce battle against the twelve heavy guns of the enemy in front of them. The first three test shots they fired all hit the target, followed by rapid bombardment. Although the climate in Korea was already two degrees below zero, the cotton uniforms of the gunners operating nervously were soaked with sweat. They took off their wet cotton uniforms and covered them on the hot gun barrels due to continuous firing and continued to bombard the enemy's artillery positions. The shells fired by the enemy exploded on the position, but the gunners bravely fought on, regardless of the raging fire that had started beside them. Jin Ershi, the artillery telephone operator, had both legs blown off, but he still stubbornly connected three wires, maintaining telephone contact between the artillery position and the command organ. After fifteen minutes of fierce bombardment, the gunners set the enemy's artillery group on fire, which burned for three hours. Eleven of the enemy's twelve heavy guns were destroyed. Dozens of trucks that the enemy had just driven into their artillery positions were also completely destroyed.

    The infantry warriors who held on to the two heroic positions also vowed to respond to the commendation and concern of the Volunteer Army leaders with new combat victories, annihilating more than 2,200 enemy troops in one day on October 29th.

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 19th. Before returning to China, the Third Sub-Group of the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea sent a telegram congratulating the Volunteer Army combat troops on the Shangganling front north of Jinhua on their great victory. The congratulatory telegram said: We are very excited to receive the good news that you have annihilated tens of thousands of enemy troops in the Shangganling area north of Jinhua on the eve of our return to China. After returning to China, we must convey and report this victory and the heroic deeds of the comrades to the people of the motherland. The congratulatory telegram encouraged all commanders and fighters to continue to achieve even greater combat results.

    志愿军首长嘉勉上甘岭作战部队
    赴朝慰问团第三分团亦致电祝贺伟大胜利
     【新华社朝鲜前线十九日电】中国人民志愿军首长两次致电金化以北上甘岭前线作战部队的指挥员和战斗员，嘉勉和祝贺他们在坚强的防御作战中取得的光辉胜利。志愿军首长在第一次嘉勉电中说：“你们在十月十四日到二十六日的十三昼夜中进行顽强的防御战和积极的反击战，已将美七师和伪二师歼灭了八千多人，阻止了敌人的进犯，坚守了阵地。这种为和平而战的坚强精神，殊堪嘉奖，望你们再接再厉，彻底粉碎敌人的进攻。”志愿军首长在第二次嘉勉电中说：“你们与敌奋战二十多天。敌人集中了空前优势的炮火、飞机和坦克，用大量步兵进行集团冲锋，结果不但不能夺取你们的阵地，而且损失了一万八千多人（按：现在敌军损失已增至两万人以上）及大量炮弹。你们在激烈的战斗中，高度发挥了坚韧顽强的战斗作风。你们愈打愈强，战术愈打愈灵活，步炮协同愈战愈密切，这样打下去，必能致敌于死命。”
    在上甘岭前线作战的志愿军的步兵部队和炮兵部队在嘉勉电的鼓舞下，更加发扬了英勇顽强的作战精神。十月二十七日下午，炮兵部队某团第九连的炮手们刚读完嘉勉电就投入了摧毁敌军炮兵群的战斗。在“用新的胜利来回答首长给我们的荣誉”的口号下，炮手们和当面敌军的十二门重炮展开猛烈的对战，他们开始发射的三发试射炮弹都全部击中目标，紧接着就是急促的轰击。朝鲜的气候虽然已经在零下二度，但紧张操作的炮手们的棉衣都被汗水湿透了。他们把湿棉衣脱下来盖在由于接连射击而致发热的炮筒上，继续不断地轰击敌军炮兵阵地。敌军发射过来的炮弹在阵地上爆炸开来，炮手们不顾身旁已经燃起烈火，仍旧奋勇作战。炮兵电话员金耳世的双腿被炸断了，他还是顽强地接起了三根电线，保持了炮兵阵地和指挥机关的电话联系。炮手们经过十五分钟的猛烈轰击，使敌人的炮群燃起了熊熊烈火，一直烧了三小时。敌人的十二门重炮被摧毁了十一门。敌人刚刚开进自己炮兵阵地的几十辆卡车，也被全部击毁。
    坚守在两个英雄阵地上的步兵勇士们也都誓以新的战斗胜利来回答志愿军首长的嘉勉和关怀，在十月二十九日一天中歼灭了敌人二千二百多名。
    【新华社朝鲜前线十九日电】中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团第三分团在回国之前曾致电祝贺金化以北上甘岭前线志愿军作战部队的伟大胜利。贺电中说：在我们回国的前夕，接获你们在金化以北上甘岭地区歼敌一万数千人的捷报，实在兴奋。我们回国后一定要把这一胜利和同志们的英雄事迹，向祖国人民进行传达报告。贺电鼓励全体指挥员战斗员继续取得更加巨大的战果。
