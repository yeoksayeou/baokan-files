Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The people's democratic countries of Eastern Europe have achieved significant accomplishments in their third-quarter production. According to the communiqués released by these countries regarding the implementation results of the third-quarter national economic plans, compared to the third quarter of 1951, the total industrial output of Poland and Czechoslovakia increased by 21 percent, Romania by 25.1 percent, Hungary by 24.3 percent, Bulgaria by 17 percent, and Albania by 50 percent. Labor productivity in the industries of these countries has also been further improved: the labor productivity of workers in Poland's socialist industries increased by 14 percent compared to the third quarter of last year, Romania by 12 percent, and the average output per industrial worker in Hungary increased by 11.6 percent compared to last year.

In the third-quarter industrial production of the people's democratic countries, the development of heavy industry is particularly important. The output of zinc ore, pure lead, locomotives, tractors, and other heavy industrial products in Poland exceeded the third-quarter production plan. The output of petroleum, gas, iron ore, copper, steel pipes, steam boilers, transformers, electric motors and diesel engines, machine tools, ball bearings, etc., in Romania also exceeded the plan. Compared to the third quarter of 1951, the output of hard coal in Czechoslovakia increased by 23 percent, coke by 19 percent, iron ore by 28 percent, manganese ore by 41 percent, and pig iron by 16 percent. Hungary's heavy industrial output has increased by 31 percent compared to the same quarter last year, with the production of the mining industry increasing by 36.5 percent and the metallurgical industry by 21.2 percent. Significant progress has been made in the capital construction work of various countries. Poland's expenditure on capital construction from January to September this year, calculated at comparable prices, increased by 26 percent compared to the same period in 1951. In the third quarter, Romania had a number of new factories put into operation, including two giant thermal power plants, a gas and chemical factory, and a leather material factory.

Agriculture in the people's democratic countries of Eastern Europe has been further mechanized in the third quarter. As of September 30 this year, the number of tractors in Polish agriculture, calculated at 15 horsepower per unit, increased by 33 percent compared to the same period last year. Hungary has added 254 harvesters and sheaf binders, 636 threshing machines, 573 tractors, and 16,000 other agricultural machines this year. The area of land harvested by machines in Hungary's agricultural machinery stations and state farms has doubled compared to last year. The socialist component of agriculture in various countries has developed greatly in the third quarter. The number of cooperative farms in Poland has increased to 4,215, and the cultivated land area of various agricultural production cooperatives in Czechoslovakia has accounted for 30.5 percent of the country's total cultivated land area. As of September 30 this year, the cultivated land area of cooperatives in Hungary increased by 42 percent compared to last year, and the number of new members increased by 32 percent compared to last year. Due to the mechanization of agriculture and the development of the agricultural production cooperation movement, the output of many major agricultural products in various countries has increased compared to last year. For example, the average harvest of wheat, barley, and oats in Poland increased by about 10 percent compared to last year, wheat production in Czechoslovakia increased by 9 percent compared to last year, and hemp production increased by 37 percent. The yield per unit area of socialist agriculture in various countries has exceeded the yield per unit area of individual farmers.

With the development of the national economy, the material living standards of the working people in the people's democratic countries of Eastern Europe have also improved. This improvement is prominently reflected in the increase in wages and the increase in purchasing power. The wages of workers in Hungary in the third quarter increased by 18.3 percent compared to the same quarter last year. The sales volume of consumer goods in Romania in the third quarter increased by 102.9 percent compared to the same quarter last year. The retail sales of bread and rye flour in Czechoslovakia in the third quarter increased by 16 percent compared to the same quarter last year, bicycles increased by 54 percent, and motorized bicycles increased by 69 percent. The cultural and material welfare of the working people has been greatly enhanced. Taking Hungary as an example, the number of books published in the third quarter increased by 44 percent compared to the same quarter last year, and 66 small cinemas, 66 libraries, and many cultural centers have been added in rural areas. In the third quarter of this year, 100,000 workers in Hungary received priority vacations, and 80,000 young working people received free rest.

    波捷罗匈保阿第三季经济计划执行结果
    工农业获重大发展人民生活水平显著提高
    【新华社十八日讯】东欧人民民主国家第三季生产已获得了重大成就。根据这些国家发表的第三季国民经济计划执行结果的公报，和一九五一年第三季相比，波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的工业总产量都增加了百分之二十一，罗马尼亚增加了百分之二十五点一，匈牙利增加了百分之二十四点三，保加利亚增加了百分之十七，阿尔巴尼亚增加了百分之五十。这些国家的工业中的劳动生产率也进一步提高了：波兰社会主义工业的工人劳动生产率比去年第三季提高了百分之十四，罗马尼亚提高了百分之十二，匈牙利每个产业工人的平均生产量比去年提高了百分之十一点六。
    在人民民主国家的第三季工业生产中，特别重要的是重工业的发展。波兰的锌矿砂、纯铅、机车、拖拉机等重工业品的产量都超过了第三季的生产计划。罗马尼亚的石油、瓦斯、铁矿砂、铜、钢管、蒸气锅炉、变压器、电力发动机和柴油发动机、工作母机、球轴承等的产量也都超过了计划。和一九五一年第三季相比，捷克斯洛伐克的硬煤产量增加了百分之二十三，焦炭增加了百分之十九，铁矿砂增加了百分之二十八，锰矿砂增加了百分之四十一，生铁增加了百分之十六。匈牙利重工业产量已比去年同季提高了百分之三十一，其中采矿工业的生产量增加了百分之三十六点五，冶金工业增加了百分之二十一点二。各国的基本建设工作已有很大的进展。波兰从今年一月到九月间在基本建设方面的开支，按比较价格计算，比一九五一年同期增加了百分之二十六。罗马尼亚在第三季已有不少新的工厂开工，其中包括两个巨型热力厂、一个瓦斯和化学工厂、一个制革材料工厂。
    东欧人民民主国家的农业在第三季中已进一步机械化了。到今年九月三十日为止，波兰农业中的拖拉机数目，按照每辆十五匹马力计算，比去年同期增加了百分之三十三。匈牙利今年增加了二百五十四架收割机和捆禾机，六百三十六架打谷机，五百七十三架拖拉机和一万六千架其他农业机器。匈牙利的农业机器站和国营农场用机器收割作物的土地面积比去年增大了一倍。各国农业中的社会主义成分在第三季中有了很大的发展。波兰合作社农场的数目已增加到四千二百一十五个，捷克斯洛伐克各种农业生产合作社的耕地面积已占全国耕地面积的百分之三十点五。匈牙利到今年九月三十日为止，合作社的耕地面积比去年增加了百分之四十二，新入社的社员户数比去年增多了百分之三十二。由于农业的机械化和农业生产合作运动的发展，各国许多主要农产品的产量都比去年增加了。例如，波兰的小麦、大麦和燕麦的收获量平均比去年增加了百分之十左右，捷克斯洛伐克的小麦比去年增产百分之九，大麻增产百分之三十七。各国社会主义农业的单位面积收获量都超过了个体农民的单位面积收获量。
    随着国民经济的发展，东欧人民民主国家劳动人民的物质生活水平也提高了。这种提高突出地表现在工资的增加和购买力的提高上。匈牙利第三季的工人工资比去年同季增加了百分之十八点三。罗马尼亚第三季的消费品销售量比去年同季增加了百分之一百零二点九。捷克斯洛伐克第三季的面包和裸麦面粉零售额比去年同季增加百分之十六，自行车增加百分之五十四，机器脚踏车增加百分之六十九。劳动人民的文化和物质生活福利已大为增进。以匈牙利为例，第三季出版的书籍比去年同季增加了百分之四十四，农村里已增设了六十六个小型电影院、六十六个图书馆和许多文化馆。匈牙利的十万工人今年第三季得到了优先休假，八万劳动人民的青年得到免费休息。
