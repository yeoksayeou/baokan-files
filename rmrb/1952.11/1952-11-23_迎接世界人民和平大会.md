    Welcoming the World People's Peace Congress
    A historically significant international conference—the World People's Peace Congress—is scheduled to be held in Vienna, the capital of Austria, on December 12th. The scale and breadth of representation of this conference will be unprecedented, with over two thousand representatives from countries around the world expected to participate. The Chinese people warmly welcome the convocation of this conference and will send a broadly representative delegation to attend. We believe that this conference will certainly promote the further development of the global movement to defend peace and facilitate the formation of an anti-war alliance among various classes and social strata who desire to end international tensions and prevent a new world war.
    No one can deny that a tense international situation currently exists. This tense international situation is caused by the aggressive war policies of the monopoly capitalists of the United States and their office, the United States government. The United States government is continuing and preparing to expand the war of aggression in Korea, implementing an arms race expansion under the guise of the "Cold War," militarizing the national economy, enslaving the people of Japan and West Germany and re-militarizing Japan and West Germany, forcing other capitalist countries to expand their armaments, accept aggressive military alliances, provide military bases, provide cannon fodder for aggression, unscrupulously depriving these countries of their rights to national independence, infringing upon their territorial sovereignty, plundering their resources, and forcing these countries to implement economic blockades and embargoes. All this places all mankind in the face of a growing threat of new war, and primarily brings increasingly serious consequences and crises to various capitalist countries, colonies, and dependent countries. Because it is very clear that the war of aggression in Korea and the expansion of armaments, for the American people, are only endless and increasing deaths, a never-ending decline in living standards, and the deprivation of basic democratic rights. All other capitalist countries that follow the United States government are trapping themselves under the iron claws of the United States and living a miserable life, and subjecting their people to tyrannical foreign enslavement.
    The immediate stakes force more and more people in the capitalist system to consider the future of themselves, their people, and their countries. They see that the path arranged for them by a small handful of warmongers in the United States is a dead end. They also see that there is another path, which is the path of easing current international tensions and maintaining peace, the path of international peace and cooperation. This path requires ending the existing war, ending the so-called "Cold War," ending the expansion of armaments, implementing fair and supervised universal disarmament, banning atomic weapons, bacteriological weapons, and chemical weapons, banning war propaganda, holding great power negotiations and concluding great power peace pacts, ending blockades and embargoes, expanding trade between countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, strictly prohibiting the re-militarization of West Germany and Japan, peacefully resolving the German and Japanese issues, ensuring the national independence of all countries, and consolidating the security of all countries. Many people, because they have seen all this, are taking the path of safeguarding peace, or are inclined to do so. This is expanding the ranks of peace advocates, expanding the social foundation of the peace movement, and isolating the warmongers. This is a major change in world political life. The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing, our capital, in October, and the International Conference for a Peaceful Solution to the German Question held in Berlin in November vividly demonstrate this point. Attending those conferences were not only many veteran peace activists, but also many new peace activists, who were representing broad social strata.
    The facts fully prove Comrade Malenkov's recent famous assertion about the tremendous development of the world peace movement: "Due to the increasing threat of war, a peace movement is unfolding that involves the people of all countries, different classes and social strata are forming alliances against war, because ending international tensions and preventing new world wars is in their interest. The warmongers have no way to label this non-partisan and democratic peace movement as their so-called communist party movement. ...Because this movement...is a democratic movement with billions of people participating." ("Report of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) at the Nineteenth Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)")
    We, the Chinese people, along with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, have always adhered to the path of international peace. We sincerely support the wise decision of the World Peace Council to convene this World People's Peace Congress, and we sincerely support the proposal of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council to make "ending existing wars," "ending the 'Cold War,'" and "guaranteeing the independence and security of all peoples" the main topics of this conference. Our people will work together with friends from all over the world to strive unremittingly for the winning and defending of world peace.

### 迎接世界人民和平大会

    迎接世界人民和平大会
    一个具有巨大历史意义的国际会议——世界人民和平大会，已定于十二月十二日在奥地利京城维也纳举行。这次会议的规模和代表的广泛性将是空前的，预计会有来自全世界各国的二千多位代表参加这次会议。中国人民热烈欢迎这次会议的召开，并将派遣代表性极广泛的代表团出席这次会议。我们相信，这次大会必能推动全世界各国保卫和平运动的进一步发展，促进愿意结束国际紧张局势和防止新的世界大战的各种不同的阶级和社会阶层的反战联盟的形成。
    谁都不能否认，目前存在着一个紧张的国际局势。这一紧张的国际局势，是美国的垄断资本家们和他们的办事处美国政府的侵略战争政策所造成的。美国政府正在继续并准备扩大侵朝战争，实行以“冷战”为名的扩张军备，实行国民经济的军事化，奴役日本和西德的人民并使日本和西德重新军国主义化，强使其他资本主义国家扩张军备、接受侵略性的军事同盟、提供军事基地、提供侵略炮灰，肆无忌惮地剥夺这些国家的民族独立权利、侵犯这些国家的领土主权，掠夺这些国家的资源，并强使这些国家实行经济封锁和禁运。这一切就使全人类面临着日益增长的新战争威胁，而且首先是给各资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国带来了日益严重的后果和危机。因为这是很明显的，侵朝战争和扩军备战对于美国人民来说，只是没有穷尽和越来越多的死亡，没有止境的生活水平的下降，和基本民主权利的被剥夺。所有其他追随美国政府的资本主义国家都使它们自己陷在美国的铁爪之下而过着可怜的生活，并使他们的人民遭到横暴的外国奴役。
    切身的利害关系迫使资本主义体系各国的越来越多的人们考虑他们自己、他们的人民和他们的国家的前途。他们看到，美国一小撮好战分子给他们安排的只是一条绝路。他们也看到，现在还存在着另外一条道路，这就是松弛目前的国际紧张局势而保持和平的道路，国际和平和合作的道路。这条道路要求结束现存的战争，结束所谓“冷战”，结束扩张军备，实行公正而有监督的普遍裁减军备，禁止原子武器、细菌武器和化学武器，禁止战争宣传，举行大国谈判和缔结大国和平公约，结束封锁和禁运，在平等互利基础上扩大各国之间的贸易，严禁西德和日本的重新军国主义化，和平解决德国问题和日本问题，保障各国的民族独立和巩固各国的安全。许多人因为看到了这一切，而走到维护和平的道路上来，或者倾向于这样做。这样就使和平拥护者的队伍日益扩大，就使和平运动的社会基础日益扩大，就使战争贩子们日益孤立。这是世界政治生活中的重大变化。十月间在我国首都北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议和十一月间在柏林召开的国际争取和平解决德国问题会议，生动地证明这一点。出席那些会议的，不仅有许多和平运动的老战士，而且有许多和平运动的新战士，而他们是代表了广大的社会阶层出席那些会议的。
    事实完全证明了马林科夫同志最近关于世界和平运动的巨大发展的一个著名的论断：“由于日渐增长的战争威胁，一个把各国人民都卷入其中的和平运动正在开展，不同的阶级和社会阶层正在组成反对战争的联盟，因为结束国际紧张局势和防止新的世界大战是符合他们的利益的。战争贩子们没有办法把这个非党派的和平民主运动说成为他们所谓的共产党党派运动。……因为这个运动……是一个有亿万人民参加的民主运动。”（“在联共（布）第十九次代表大会上所作联共（布）中央委员会的报告”）
    我们中国人民和苏联及各人民民主国家在一起，是始终坚持国际和平的道路的。我们热诚拥护世界和平理事会召开这次世界人民和平大会的英明决定，并且热诚拥护世界和平理事会常务委员会把
    “结束现存战争”“结束‘冷战’”和“保证各国人民的独立和安全”作为这次会议的主要议题的建议。我国人民将与全世界各国的朋友们在一道，为争取和保卫世界和平而奋斗不懈。
