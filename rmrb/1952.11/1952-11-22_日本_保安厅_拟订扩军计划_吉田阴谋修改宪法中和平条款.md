    Japan's "Security Agency" Drafts Military Expansion Plan
    Yoshida Conspires to Revise the Peace Clause in the Constitution
    [Xinhua News Agency, 20th] TASS, 19th: The Japanese government is continuing to accelerate its work on remilitarization. According to the "Tokyo Times," the Director-General of the "Security Agency," Tokutaro Kimura, is drafting a plan to increase the number of "Security Forces" to 300,000. This "Security Force" is already equipped with small aircraft, tanks, automatic guns, mortars, rocket launchers, rifles, and machine guns.
    In order to expand the "Security Force," the Japanese "Security Agency" intends to conclude an agreement with the US military headquarters by the end of this year to lease more aircraft, tanks, machine guns, and other weapons. According to the "Asahi Shimbun," US and Japanese representatives are conducting formal negotiations on this issue.
    The "Mainichi Shimbun" says that the issue of supplying the expanding Japanese army with arms was specifically discussed during the recent visit to Japan by Donald W. Smith, Assistant Director of the so-called "Mutual Security Agency." Smith held secret talks with Japanese ministers Tadaharu Mukai, Hayato Ikeda, Tokutaro Kimura, and Katsuo Okazaki. At the same time, the "Mainichi Shimbun" pointed out that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of International Trade and Industry, and the "Security Agency" are drafting a "long-term plan for military measures." They are working according to a letter recently sent to the Japanese government by the Chief of Staff of the US Forces in Japan, Hickey, which outlined the US plan to revive Japanese militarism.
    The Japanese government's actions to remilitarize Japan and its blatant steps to build a large army are completely contrary to the post-war Japanese Constitution. Article 9 of the Constitution prohibits Japan from remilitarizing and rebuilding its army. Therefore, the Japanese government has decided to raise the issue of amending the Constitution. Tokyo Radio reported on the 17th that the ruling Liberal Party, headed by Yoshida, has passed a resolution to establish a special committee to amend this article of the Constitution.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 21st] Tokyo dispatch: The ruling Japanese Yoshida reactionary group is conspiring to revise the peace clause of the Japanese Constitution in order to remove obstacles to the large-scale revival of militarist forces.
    The Liberal Party, headed by Shigeru Yoshida, decided at its General Affairs Committee meeting on the 17th to establish a so-called "Constitutional Issues Investigation Committee" within the party, specifically responsible for studying the issue of amending the Constitution. According to Kyodo News, the main task of this so-called investigation committee is to study how to amend Article 9 of the Constitution, which stipulates that Japan renounces war and prohibits remilitarization.
    In order to obtain a sufficient majority to pass a proposal to amend the Constitution in the Diet, the Yoshida government is actively wooing the reactionary leaders of opposition parties. Shigeru Yoshida has sent representatives to solicit the opinions of the leaders of the Reform Party on the issue of amending the Constitution, hoping that they will support it in the Diet.

### 日本“保安厅”拟订扩军计划  吉田阴谋修改宪法中和平条款

    日本“保安厅”拟订扩军计划
    吉田阴谋修改宪法中和平条款
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社十九日讯：日本政府正在继续加速进行重新军国主义化的工作。据“东京时报”报道，“保安厅”长官木村笃太郎正在拟订一项计划，把“保安队”的人数增加到三十万。这支“保安队”已经有了小型飞机、坦克、自动枪、迫击炮、火箭炮、步枪和机关枪等装备。
    为要扩充“保安队”，日本“保安厅”打算在本年年底以前和美军司令部缔结一项租借更多飞机、坦克、机关枪和其他武器的协定。据“朝日新闻”说，美日代表正就这个问题进行正式的谈判。
    “每日新闻”说，供给正在扩大中的日本陆军以武装的问题，在所谓“共同安全署”助理署长唐纳瓦德最近访问日本期间，曾经进行了具体的讨论。唐纳瓦德曾和日本的大臣向井忠晴、池田勇人、木村笃太郎和冈崎胜男进行了秘密谈判。同时，“每日新闻”指出：日本外务省、大藏省、通商产业省以及“保安厅”正在拟订一项“军事措施的长期计划”。他们正在按照驻日美军参谋长希凯最近送交日本政府的一封信进行工作，该信概述了美国关于复活日本军国主义的计划。
    日本政府重新使日本军国主义化的行为，以及公然采取建立一支大型陆军的步骤，是完全和日本战后宪法相抵触的。该宪法第九条禁止日本重新军国主义化和重建陆军。因此，日本政府已决定提出修改宪法的问题。东京电台十七日报道，以吉田为首的执政的自由党，已经通过一项决定，要建立一个特别委员会来修改宪法中的这一条。
    【新华社二十一日讯】东京消息：执政的日本吉田反动集团正阴谋修改日本宪法的和平条款，为大规模复活军国主义势力扫除障碍。
    以吉田茂为首的自由党在十七日的总务会上决定在党内设立一个所谓“宪法问题调查会”，专门负责研究修改宪法问题。据共同社透露，这个所谓调查会的主要任务，是研究怎样修改宪法中规定日本弃绝战争和禁止重新军国主义化的第九条。
    吉田政府为了取得足够的多数使国会通过修改宪法的提案，正在积极拉拢在野党派的反动首脑。吉田茂已经派出了代表就修改宪法的问题向改进党的领袖征求意见，希望他们在国会中予以支持。
