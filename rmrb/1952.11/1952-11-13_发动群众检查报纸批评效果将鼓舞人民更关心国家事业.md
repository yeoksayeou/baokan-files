    Editor: Recently, the "Reader's Letters" page opened a column on "Correctly Treating Criticism and Self-Criticism," asking readers to tell you about the effects of criticisms and suggestions published in the newspaper. I think this practice is completely correct and necessary. Only in this way can the supervisory role of the newspaper be better exerted, can mass criticism and suggestions more effectively become a force for promoting improvement in work, can the enthusiasm of the people to care about national affairs be consolidated and encouraged, and can the combat effectiveness of criticism and self-criticism be strengthened. This is a manifestation of the Party newspaper being responsible to the people. I hope you will carry out this spirit, and I suggest that Party newspapers across the country can also do this.
    Now I will tell you about the effect of the suggestion "The Nanjing Branch of the Bank of Communications Should Immediately Abolish the Unreasonable System of Requiring Employees to Provide Shop Guarantees," which was published in the "Reader's Letters" column on September 12.

    After studying in the cadre training class of the East China District Bank of Communications, we were assigned to work in the Nanjing Branch by the East China Personnel Department. However, the branch required us to find an "established shop guarantee" or two "people with a reputation in the local community" to bear "unlimited liability." This made many comrades feel very embarrassed. My younger brother, Zhou Xiuqing, learned about this and believed that this was an unreasonable system, so he reported the situation to the Shanghai Liberation Daily in mid-August, and reported the situation to you at the end of August. When I learned about this, I still looked at the new society with an old perspective, thinking that his doing so would not achieve much effect.

    Thanks to the support of the Party newspaper, the leading organs of the East China District Bank of Communications attached great importance to this issue. After research, they instructed the Nanjing Branch to stop implementing this system. When the personnel department notified me, I couldn't help but feel extremely happy; other comrades who were assigned to work here with me also felt extremely excited. I happily wrote a letter to tell my younger brother and classmates who were assigned to work in other areas about this good news. I said: "This concrete fact makes me realize the greatness and correctness of the Party and Chairman Mao. This matter encouraged me. I will strengthen my studies and work hard to repay the Party and Chairman Mao for their care for us."

    The replies from the comrades also unanimously reflected that they had received great education from this incident. My younger brother replied in his letter: "Through this incident, I further realized the supervisory role of the newspaper and deeply realized that the Party newspaper is seriously and responsibly handling people's letters. I must better reflect the situation and mass opinions to the newspaper in the future."

### 发动群众检查报纸批评效果将鼓舞人民更关心国家事业

    发动群众检查报纸批评效果将鼓舞人民更关心国家事业
    编辑同志：最近“读者来信专页”辟了“正确地对待批评和自我批评”一栏，要求读者把报纸上发表批评建议后所起的效果告诉你们。我认为这种做法是完全正确和必要的。只有如此，才能更好地发挥报纸的监督作用，才能使群众性的批评建议更有效地成为推动改进工作的力量，才能巩固与鼓舞人民群众关心国家事业的积极性，才能加强批评和自我批评的战斗力。这是党报向人民群众负责的表现。希望你们把这种精神贯彻下去，并建议全国各地的党报也能这样做。
    现在我把九月十二日“读者来信”栏所刊“交通银行南京分行应即废除向职工要铺保等不合理制度”的建议所起的效果告诉你们。
    我们在交通银行华东区行干部训练班学习后，由华东人事部分配到南京分行工作。但该行却要我们找一家“殷实铺保”或二个“在当地社会上享有声誉的人”负“无限责任”。这使很多同志感到十分为难。我弟弟周修庆知道了这件事，认为这是一种不合理的制度，就在八月中旬把情况反映给上海解放日报，并在八月末把情况反映给你们。当我知道这件事情以后，我还以旧的眼光来看新的社会，认为他这样做是不能得到多大效果的。
    由于党报的支持，交通银行华东区领导机关很重视这个问题，经过研究后，就指示南京分行停止执行这一制度。当人事股通知我时，我不禁喜悦万分；和我一起被分配到此工作的其他同志也感到无比的兴奋。我高兴地把这一喜讯写信告诉我弟弟和分配在其他地区工作的同学们。我说：“这一个具体事实，使我认识到党和毛主席的伟大和正确。这件事鼓舞了我。我要加强学习，努力工作，以报答党与毛主席对我们的关怀。”
    同志们的回信中也一致反映，他们从这个事件中受到了很大的教育。我弟弟回信说：“通过这一事件，我进一步认识到报纸的监督作用，深深地体会到党报是认真负责处理人民来信的。我今后一定要更好地给报社反映情况和群众意见。”
