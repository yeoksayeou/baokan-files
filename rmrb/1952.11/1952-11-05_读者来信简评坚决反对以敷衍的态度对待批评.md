Reader's Letters Briefly Comment on Resolutely Opposing a Perfunctory Attitude Towards Criticism

After the Tangshan Public-Operated Stone Company was criticized by this newspaper for not caring about the hardships of workers and not valuing workers' opinions, although they expressed acceptance, they have not made any practical corrections for more than three months. Readers Comrades Feng Jiuling and Feng Jiulu continue to expose the company's erroneous attitude towards criticism, which is very necessary. What consequences has the Tangshan Public-Operated Stone Company's perfunctory attitude towards criticism caused?

The facts are very clear: those unreasonable systems that were criticized still exist today, and the problems that workers urgently demand have not been resolved. This means that a perfunctory attitude towards criticism, only acknowledging the correctness of the criticism but not adopting practical methods for correction, will inevitably result in the continuation, and even the growth, of shortcomings and errors. Furthermore, this failure to seriously accept criticism and earnestly correct errors will inevitably dampen the enthusiasm of the working masses for caring about the factory, alienate the leadership from the masses, and even block the correct development of mass criticism and self-criticism. This is a very serious problem.

Carrying out mass criticism and self-criticism is an important step in truly promoting democracy and attracting the masses to actively participate in the cause of national construction, and it is a driving force for accelerating social progress. Therefore, those who truly care about national construction and work, and those who truly value the masses and understand democracy, will attach great importance to the criticism of the masses. Correctly dealing with criticism means not only acknowledging the correctness of the criticism and examining one's own mistakes, but also researching effective methods for correcting errors and earnestly checking the actual effect of correcting errors.

In order to ensure the correct development of mass criticism and self-criticism, we ask the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to educate the Party organization of the Stone Company, urge them to examine and correct this perfunctory erroneous attitude towards criticism, earnestly accept mass criticism to improve their work, and provide a public reply to this newspaper. At the same time, we also ask the vast number of readers to continue to assist us in checking and exposing units or individuals who treat criticism in a perfunctory manner. We believe that under the education of the Party and the supervision of the masses, all erroneous behaviors that hinder the development of criticism will be strictly criticized until they are thoroughly corrected.

    读者来信简评坚决反对以敷衍的态度对待批评
    唐山公营石头公司不关心工人疾苦、不重视工人意见，经本报批评后，虽然表示接受，但三个多月来并没有实际改正。读者冯九龄、冯九禄同志继续揭发该公司这种对待批评的错误态度，这是十分必要的。唐山公营石头公司以敷衍的态度对待批评，已经引起了怎样的结果呢？
    事实非常明显，那些被批评了的不合理的制度至今依然存在，而工人所迫切要求的问题并没有得到解决。这就是说，以敷衍的态度对待批评，只承认批评的正确，并不采取实际改正的办法，其结果必然是使缺点和错误继续存在，甚至还在滋长；而这种不认真接受批评，不切实改正错误的结果，又必然使工人群众关心工厂的积极性受到打击，使领导脱离群众，以致堵塞了群众性的批评与自我批评的正确开展。这是十分严重的问题。
    开展群众性的批评和自我批评，是真正发扬民主，吸引群众积极参加国家建设事业的重要步骤，是加速社会进步的动力。因此，真正关心国家建设和工作的人，真正重视群众和懂得民主的人，都会十分重视群众的批评。正确地对待批评，不仅是承认批评的正确，检讨自己的错误，同时还必须研究出改正错误的有效方法，切实检查改正错误的实际效果。
    为了保障群众性的批评和自我批评得以正确开展，我们要求中共唐山市委会对石头公司党组织进行教育，督促他们检查并纠正这种对待批评的敷衍的错误态度，切实接受群众批评改进工作，并向本报作公开的答复。同时，我们还要求广大读者继续协助我们检查和揭发以敷衍的态度对待批评的单位或个人。我们相信，在党的教育和群众的监督下，一切阻碍开展批评的错误行为都将受到严格的批评直到彻底改正。
