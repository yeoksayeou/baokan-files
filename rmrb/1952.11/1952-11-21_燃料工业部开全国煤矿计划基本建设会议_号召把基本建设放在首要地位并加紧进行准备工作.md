    The Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government convened the National Coal Mine Planning and Capital Construction Conference from October 20th to 27th. This conference clearly pointed out that in the coal mining industry, capital construction must be placed in a primary position and preparatory work must be intensified. Based on this spirit, the conference formulated the capital construction and production plan for 1953 and resolved several important issues in the preparatory work for capital construction.

    Minister Chen Yu of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry made a report to the conference, pointing out that the restoration, reconstruction, and key construction work of the coal mining industry have achieved results in the past three years. However, relying solely on existing shafts for production is far from meeting the needs of the country's large-scale economic construction. In 1953, the state will invest heavily in the coal mining industry. The vast majority of these investments will be used to develop resources and build new mines. In order to do a good job in capital construction next year, the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry has instructed the main leading cadres of each mine to immediately lead the capital construction work with all their strength, and to transfer strong and excellent administrative cadres, technical personnel, and workers to enrich the capital construction departments. The conference unanimously recognized that in all capital construction work, drilling must be regarded as an overriding task. Drilling is not only the most important preparatory work for capital construction next year but also for the next several years. The drilling task in 1953 is very heavy, and the state invests a lot. Minister Chen Yu pointed out that the Northeast has considerable experience in this regard, and hopes that everyone will learn from the Northeast. He also asked everyone to overcome difficulties, prepare forces, and ensure the completion of the state's tasks in terms of quantity and quality with the greatest efforts.

    The conference also focused on discussing various preparatory work issues related to capital construction: First, regarding the strengthening of design institutions. The Central Ministry of Fuel Industry has established the Beijing Coal Mine Design Bureau and the Northeast Coal Mine Design Bureau. It will equip 1,200 design cadres by the end of this year. The conference specifically allocated the quotas for each region and each mining bureau to send cadres to the design bureaus. Second, regarding the organization and training of forces. To complete the capital construction tasks for next year, it is necessary to supplement nearly 4,000 technical personnel and tens of thousands of skilled workers (of which drilling alone requires more than 2,000 technical personnel and 7,000 skilled workers). In addition to transferring excellent workers from production, short-term training courses and junior technical schools will be held on a large scale to supplement skilled workers. North China, East China, Central South, Southwest, and Northwest regions will also transfer a group of excellent workers to the shaft construction sites of various mines in the Northeast to learn shaft sinking and drilling techniques. There is a great shortage of people in civil engineering and construction. In addition to large-scale transfer and training, this year's skilled workers will all be transferred to fixed workers. The method of solving the shortage of technical personnel is to greatly expand and run junior, intermediate, and even senior technical schools in addition to transferring a large number from production. This work has been determined to be handled by the Ministry of Fuel Industry as a whole. Next year, the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry system will establish fourteen new technical schools and expand the existing sixteen technical schools. These schools will enroll a large number of new students next year. North China, East China, and other regions will also send some technical personnel to the Northeast for a year of internship to master various technologies for building new mines. There are many difficulties in organizing and training forces. The conference asked everyone to adopt simple and crude methods in the spirit of revolution to complete this task in a timely manner. Third, regarding various quotas and domestic and foreign orders for capital construction next year. In the past, each region had its own set of quotas, which caused many difficulties. In this conference, average advanced quotas for drilling, civil engineering, construction, installation, and electromechanical aspects were formulated by region based on the specific conditions of each region. These quotas are practical and feasible, and at the same time have a certain role in promoting advanced experience. In the past, order plans were often based on estimates rather than based on basic construction plans, and were not timely enough. There are many phenomena that affect the project because of waiting for orders (especially foreign orders). This conference accurately and specifically made an order plan based on the total tasks of the year and the capacity of the equipment. Everything that can be manufactured domestically should be resolved domestically as much as possible. The delivery date is also specified in detail in the order plan to avoid affecting the progress of the project. In order to strengthen the organization and leadership of the ordering work, the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry established a unified material procurement agency to uniformly control foreign orders and the allocation of various major materials in China. The organization of ordering work has now begun.

    燃料工业部开全国煤矿计划基本建设会议
    号召把基本建设放在首要地位并加紧进行准备工作
    十月二十日至二十七日，中央人民政府燃料工业部召开了全国煤矿计划、基本建设会议。这次会议明确地指出，在煤矿工业中必须把基本建设放在首要地位，并加紧进行准备工作。会议根据这一精神制定了一九五三年的基本建设和生产计划，并解决了基本建设准备工作中的若干重要问题。
    中央燃料工业部陈郁部长向会议作了报告，指出，三年来煤矿工业的恢复、改建和重点建设工作已获得了成绩。但是，光依靠现有的坑井生产还远远不能满足国家大规模经济建设的需要。一九五三年，国家将对煤矿工业大量投资。这些投资的绝大部分要用于开发资源和建设新井。为了做好明年的基本建设工作，中央燃料工业部已指示各矿主要领导干部立即以全力领导基本建设工作，并抽调坚强优秀的行政干部、技术人员和工人充实基本建设部门。大会已一致认识在各项的基本建设工作中，必须把钻探作为压倒一切的工作。钻探不仅是明年而且是今后若干年基本建设的最重要的准备工作。一九五三年的钻探任务很大，国家投资很多。陈郁部长指出东北在这方面有相当经验，希望大家向东北学习。并要求大家以最大的努力，克服困难，准备力量，保证在数量和质量上完成国家的任务。
    会议并着重讨论了有关基本建设的各项准备工作问题：第一、关于加强设计机构问题。中央燃料工业部已经成立了北京煤矿设计局和东北煤矿设计局。将在今年年内配备齐一千二百名设计干部。会议中具体分配了各地区、各矿务局向设计局输送干部的名额。第二、关于组织和培养力量问题。完成明年的基本建设任务，需要补充将近四千技术人员和几万技术工人（其中仅钻探一项就需技术人员二千多名，技术工人七千名）。补充技术工人的办法，除了从生产中抽调优秀的工人外，将要大量举办短期训练班和初级技术学校。华北、华东、中南、西南、西北各区并将抽调一批优秀工人到东北各矿山竖井工程现场学习凿井、钻探技术。土木建筑方面缺人很多，除了大量抽调和训练外，今年的技术工人将全部转为固定工人。解决技术人员不足的方法是，除了从生产中大量抽调外，将要大量的扩充并举办初级、中级、以至高级技术学校。这一工作已确定由燃料工业部统筹办理。明年，中央燃料工业部系统将要成立十四个新的技术学校，并扩充原有的十六个技术学校。这些学校明年要招收大批新生。华北、华东等区并将抽出若干名技术人员赴东北实习一年，以掌握建设新井的各种技术。组织和培养力量中的困难很多。会议要求大家以革命精神采取因陋就简的办法及时完成这一任务。第三、关于明年基本建设的各种定额和国内、国外定货问题。过去各地的定额各有一套，因而造成许多困难。这次会议中，根据各地区的具体情况分区制定了钻探、土木建筑、安装、机电等方面的平均先进定额。这些定额是切实可行的，同时对于推广先进经验也有一定的推动作用。过去，定货计划常是根据估计而不是根据基本建设计划提出的，并且不够及时。因为等待定货（特别是国外定货）而影响工程的现象很多。这次会议根据全年的总任务和设备的能力准确地具体地做出了定货计划。凡是可以在国内制造的，尽可能在国内解决。在定货计划中并详细地规定了交货日期，以免影响工程进度。为了加强对定货工作的组织领导，中央燃料工业部成立了统一的器材采购机构，统一掌握国外定货和国内各种主要物资的调拨。定货的组织工作现在已经开始。
