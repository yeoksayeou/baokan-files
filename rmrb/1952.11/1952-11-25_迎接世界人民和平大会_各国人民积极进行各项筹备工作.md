    Welcoming the World People's Peace Congress
    People of All Countries Actively Carry Out Various Preparatory Works
    Togo Kameda Calls on Japanese People to Participate in World People's Peace Congress
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Togo Kameda, the Japanese representative to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and Deputy Secretary-General of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee, delivered a radio address to the Japanese people on the 20th. In his speech, he reported to the Japanese people the great achievements of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and called on the Japanese people to participate in the World People's Peace Congress to be held in Vienna. He said: More than two thousand people will participate in this congress, including many who have not been involved in the peace movement in the past. The congress will discuss issues such as stopping the current war, ending the Cold War, and guaranteeing national independence and national security. That is to say, peace and independence are the focus of this congress. Currently, people around the world are enthusiastically preparing for this congress, and some representatives have already set off. The success of the All-Japan Peace Defense Congress recently held in Tokyo is very exciting. While implementing the resolutions of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, the Japanese people are preparing to participate in the World People's Peace Congress. This news will be warmly welcomed by the people of the world. People all over the world attach great importance to Japan's ability to participate in this meeting. Japan, which has become a base for aggression against Korea, like West Germany, bears a great responsibility in the struggle for peace.
    People from All Walks of Life in Britain Actively Nominate Representatives to Attend the Peace Congress
    According to the British Preparatory Committee of the World People's Peace Congress, as of early November, 41 representatives to the congress have been elected in various parts of Britain, and it is expected that 81 more representatives will be elected. The representatives already elected include doctors, clergy, lawyers, county councilors, housewives, and workers from various industries. The extremely broad sectors of the British people have participated in the work of preparing for the World People's Peace Congress. Ninety groups have participated in various activities to elect representatives. It is now known that 70 factory organizations will hold activities to prepare for the World People's Peace Congress.
    The movement to elect representatives to attend the World People's Peace Congress has become a mass movement in Britain, and lower-level members of the Labor Party have also widely participated in this movement. For example, in North Birmingham, 50,000 citizens participated in a conference to elect representatives. The conference raised funds for the representatives' expenses and passed a declaration calling on the five major powers to hold a meeting as soon as possible to discuss the conclusion of a peace treaty. The trade union organization in Rotherham, Yorkshire, elected a representative, and Labor Party members are assisting in raising funds for the representative.
    The attempts by right-wing leaders of the British Labor Party to prevent Labor Party members from participating in the Vienna World People's Peace Congress have failed. The dozens of representatives of the British delegation to the congress who have already been elected are mostly Labor Party members. A spokesman for the British Preparatory Committee of the World People's Peace Congress said on the 18th: "This proves that the British Labor Party opposes this peace congress, but the entire British labor movement welcomes and supports this congress."
    More and More People from All Walks of Life in France Participate in the Preparatory Work for the Peace Congress
    In France, 29 provinces have held meetings to discuss issues related to the World People's Peace Congress. The rally held in Marseille was attended by 5,000 representatives of urban and rural laborers from the Bouches-du-Rhône province. Rallies were also held in Lyon, Rhône, and Rouen, Seine-Maritime. Representatives to attend the World People's Peace Congress were elected at these rallies.
    Some individuals and organizations in France who were previously uninterested in the peace movement have participated in the preparatory work for the World People's Peace Congress. Badard, the mayor of Forges, Charente-Maritime, and a member of the Socialist Party, issued an appeal to the people of the province, calling on them to participate in the preparatory work for the congress. Famous French artists Fernand Léger and Françoise Gilot also issued statements supporting the convening of the congress. Many provincial branches of the Independent Teachers' Union and the newly established National Council of the Veterans and Resistance Movement Participants Association have called on members to participate in the congress's preparatory work. The Bobigny City Council of Seine unanimously decided to send a delegation of six city councilors to participate in the congress. At a meeting of doctors in Paris, Yves Farge, a member of the World Peace Council, delivered a speech explaining the purpose and tasks of the Vienna World People's Peace Congress. The meeting passed a resolution condemning the arms race policy and supporting the convening of the World People's Peace Congress.
