Report on the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference
Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Deputy Head of the Chinese Delegation to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference

Chairman, esteemed guests, comrades:

I now represent the Chinese delegation to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference in reporting to you, esteemed guests, comrades, and the people of the entire nation on the achievements of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and the work we should do in the future. (I)

The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference opened in Beijing on October 2nd and closed at 3:00 AM on October 13th, lasting for eleven days. The conference proceeded throughout in an atmosphere of harmony, friendship, enthusiasm, and intensity, achieving complete success and making a significant contribution to mobilizing the people of the Asian and Pacific regions and the people of the world in the cause of defending peace.

First, we should point out that representatives from various countries attended very enthusiastically. Although the Asian and Pacific regions are very vast and transportation is quite difficult, and the enemies of peace conducted blockades, obstructions, and sabotage, none of these affected the firm will of the peace delegates. Among the countries in the Asian and Pacific regions, except for Afghanistan, with whom contact was not made, the Nepalese delegation, who did not obtain passports to leave the country, and the Cambodian representative, who fell ill en route and was unable to attend, a total of thirty-seven countries sent delegations to participate in the conference. The total number of official delegates was 367, with 37 alternate delegates. Twenty-two countries belong to Asia: China, the Soviet Union, North Korea, Mongolia, Vietnam, Laos, Burma, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Thailand, Malaya, Indonesia, the Philippines, Japan, Iran, Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, and Cyprus. Two countries belong to Australia: Australia and New Zealand. Thirteen countries belong to the Pacific coast of the Americas: Canada, the United States, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Chile. In addition, there were special representatives from Algeria in Africa, a special representative from Brazil in the Atlantic region of South America, special representatives from the United Kingdom and France in Europe, and special representatives from nine international organizations—the World Peace Council, the World Federation of Trade Unions, the WFTU Liaison Bureau for Asia and Australia, the International Federation of Teachers' Associations, the Women's International Democratic Federation, the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, the World Federation of Democratic Youth, the International Union of Students, and the International Organization of Journalists. In total, there were 429 special representatives, official delegates, and alternate delegates. Based on the nationality of the delegates, there were a total of forty-six countries.

The representation of the delegates was fully extensive, representing different nationalities and races, different classes and occupations, and different religious beliefs and political views. There were world-renowned scientists, writers, poets, artists, journalists; representatives of workers, peasants, women, and youth; well-known industrialists and businessmen; prominent religious leaders; heads of various political parties; members of parliament; and individuals holding or having held important positions in the government. Some represented their country's peace organizations or various people's organizations, while others were elected through grand peace rallies across the country. Precisely for this reason, the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference had every reason to declare itself as representing the 1.6 billion people of the entire Asian and Pacific regions.

For many countries, it was not easy for their representatives to attend. They had encountered various difficulties before attending, and might encounter even greater difficulties after returning home. Many representatives said in unison that they had come to Beijing by passing through or circumventing the American blockade. For example, the representatives from the Americas could not come directly from the Pacific due to the American blockade at sea, and needed to detour through Europe to reach China. The American government is hostile to the peace movement and hostile to our conference. It not only prohibited American peace representatives from leaving the country, but also forced the governments of certain countries in Asia, Australia, and Latin America to take the same actions. However, despite the American government and some other governments that followed it using every means of obstruction, sabotage, slander, intimidation, etc., the representatives from the United States, Japan, Australia, Thailand, and many countries in Latin America still victoriously arrived in Beijing. In particular, the Japanese people and Japanese representatives demonstrated extraordinary courage and ingenuity in their tenacious struggle to participate in this conference. Their actions gave the conference immense encouragement. They won the respect and praise of all those participating in the conference.

Delegates need passports, but peace does not. No natural obstacles or artificial blockades can cut off the dissemination of truth, nor can they cut off the world's people's desire for peace and their demands for unity and friendship. For instance, although the Nepalese delegation could not attend, among the 38,241 congratulatory telegrams and letters received by the conference, there was a congratulatory telegram sent by the All-Nepal Peace Committee from Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal. The telegram contained the following words:

"You may be surprised and distressed when you hear that we are unable to attend the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference to be held in Beijing. ... However, we are closer to each other than ever before. No obstacle in the world can break the ties of our unity, affection, and friendship. We feel that we are with you in holding the peace conference, united for the noble cause of world peace. ... We send this congratulatory telegram on behalf of all peace-loving Nepalese people, and we unanimously express our support for this conference. ..."

This is the voice of the people from the southern foothills of the Himalayas, under Mount Everest, the world's highest peak. It is also the common voice of peace-loving people around the world, which no evil "Voice of America" can disrupt.

The representatives also spoke very enthusiastically. At the eleven-day conference, eight people made keynote reports, twelve people made supplementary reports, and eighty-eight people made formal speeches. If we add those who addressed the conference, made statements, and read out protest telegrams, a total of one hundred and fifteen people spoke at this conference. There were even more speakers at the eight group meetings and the presidium meetings. We can confidently say that every country had a representative speak at the conference and in the subgroups. Everyone's speeches were almost to the point of "saying everything they know and saying it all." This also fully reflected the people of all countries' earnest desire for peace.

Dr. Saifuddin Kitchlew, the head of the Indian delegation, said well in his closing speech at the conference:

"Please recall the past few days, think of those discussions—often almost endless discussions, those arguments—sometimes not very peaceful; think of the exchange of views and disagreements of people with very different opinions on every possible issue; the repeated drafting of those resolutions, declarations, and appeals—again and again and again ...

Think of all this, and then, in light of this situation, look at the amazing consensus we have shown today on every resolution.

Could such an agreement and mutual understanding be reached in any other forum in the world? I say, no. Only the peace movement can accomplish such a miracle. Only the peace movement can inspire each of us with this spirit of friendship and cooperation that permeates the entire conference."

Yes, the smooth progress of the conference was indeed somewhat like a "miracle." So many representatives came from so many countries, with such extensive representation, and the speaking situation was so enthusiastic, yet they reached a common and clear understanding. The eleven important resolutions obtained from the eleven-day conference were all unanimously adopted, with no one opposing and no one abstaining.

(II)

Let us explain the contents of the eleven resolutions.

The first is the "Message to the People of the World." This is a general program. It solemnly states that "the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific regions adhere to a common goal, which is to oppose war and defend peace." It reaffirms the firm confidence of 1.6 billion people, believing that "countries with different social systems and ways of life can coexist peacefully and cooperate for mutual benefit."

It further clearly declares that "the actions of the American government in waging war and preparing for war in this region and other parts of the world are a profound scourge for the people of the Asian and Pacific regions and the people of the world." Therefore, in response to these scourges, it puts forward six basic demands for defending peace in this region and world peace: "1. Immediately achieve an armistice in Korea on a fair and reasonable basis; end the wars in Vietnam, Malaya, and other regions; and withdraw all foreign troops from these regions.

2. Stop the revival of Japanese militarism; conclude genuine peace treaties between the relevant countries and Japan; and establish a new Japan that is independent, democratic, free, and peaceful.

3. Oppose one country interfering in the internal affairs of another country; oppose one country infringing upon the sovereignty of another country; defend and achieve national independence.

4. Oppose blockades and embargoes; promote economic cooperation and cultural exchanges between countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

5. Prohibit the incitement of war; oppose racial discrimination; protect women's rights, and promote children's welfare.

6. Promptly conclude a peace pact among the five major powers; implement disarmament; and prohibit the use of atomic weapons, bacteriological weapons, chemical weapons, and other weapons of mass slaughter."

These demands are reasonable and justified. They are not only the demands of the 1.6 billion people in the Asian and Pacific regions, but also the common demands of peace-loving people around the world—including the United States.

Here, a particularly earnest appeal is made to the American people:

"The urgent need and solemn task of the American people is to take responsibility to stop these actions of their government and lead their country onto the path of peace."

The second is the "Letter to the United Nations," which also expresses the same demands in general, and because the issue of West Germany is related to world peace and security, it simultaneously puts forward suggestions on the issue of German unification and the issue of Japan in its demands. It must be pointed out that the main intention of the "Letter to the United Nations" is to make demands and issue warnings to the United Nations. The United Nations has degenerated into a tool for the United States to cover up its aggression, and the people of the world are demanding that it "restore its lost prestige and become an authoritative institution for maintaining world peace."

In addition, the seven resolutions on the issues of Japan, Korea, national independence, cultural exchange, economic exchange, women's rights and children's welfare, and intensifying the movement to strive for the conclusion of a peace pact among the five major powers, respectively elaborate on the views and demands in the "Message to the People of the World" and the "Letter to the United Nations" in a concise manner. These seven resolutions and two declaration-style appeals can be said to be the common program formulated by this conference for the Asian and Pacific Regions peace movement. Consolidating the common will of 1.6 billion people into these nine documents will not only provide guidance for the peace movements of various countries in this region in the future, but will also make a significant contribution to the peace movement around the world. Undoubtedly, this should be considered the greatest achievement of this peace conference.

Of course, we cannot forget that in addition to these, there are two important resolutions. These are the "Resolution on Supporting the Convening of the World People's Peace Congress" and the "Resolution on Establishing the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee."

The World People's Peace Congress, called for by the World Peace Council, will be held in Vienna, the capital of Austria, in December of this year. This is a major event in the movement to defend world peace. Since the World Peace Council made this decision at the Berlin Special Session of the World Peace Council in July of this year, the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council and the peace organizations of various countries have been conducting extensive mobilization worldwide. Our Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference also made a clear resolution on this, supporting the convening of the World People's Peace Congress and calling on the people of all countries in this region to actively prepare for and participate in it. Here, we can see a clear position: the 1.6 billion people of the Asian and Pacific regions, like all peace-loving people, are willing to place their hopes for peace on the great unity of the world's peace-loving people.

The "Resolution on Establishing the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee" is equally important. This resolution will not only strengthen the connection between the peace movements of various countries in this region and promote the implementation of the various resolutions of this conference, but will also connect with the World Peace Council to support the World Peace Council's call for world peace. Therefore, the establishment of this Liaison Committee will greatly help the work of the World Peace Council. It is worth mentioning that this resolution was the first to be realized among the eleven resolutions. The Liaison Committee was officially established on October 15th; it has one chairman, eleven vice-chairmen, sixty-nine members; one secretary-general, and seven deputy secretaries-general. Mr. Soong Ching Ling, the head of our Chinese delegation, was elected as the chairman, and Mr. Liu Ningyi was elected as the secretary-general. The committee and the secretariat are located in Beijing. In this way, our Chinese people have undertaken a major responsibility in promoting and organizing the peace movement in the Asian and Pacific regions, and we should make even greater efforts.

(III)

The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference has achieved great success. It expanded the foundation of the Asian and Pacific Regions peace movement, formulated a common program for the peace movement in this region to abide by, established a regular liaison mechanism for the peace movement in this region, and carried out large-scale mobilization work for the World People's Peace Congress in December. These are all very concrete and significant gains. However, the meaning implied in these concrete gains, I would like to present four points here, based on what I have seen, for special elaboration.

First, the true face of the enemy of peace has been recognized.

In the various reports of the conference and the important speeches of representatives from various countries, especially in the various resolution documents, it was unanimously and clearly pointed out that the actions of the American government in waging war and preparing for war are a serious threat to peace in this region and world peace.

Although the American government is blatantly carrying out aggression and preparing for war, it often uses the habitual trick of "the thief crying 'stop thief'," trying to disguise itself as the defender of peace and freedom, while slandering the Soviet Union and our China as "aggressor countries." It attempts to use this deceptive method to deceive and confuse the people of its own country and some other countries, in order to drag them into war. Therefore, a basic principle of the peace movement is to expose the deceptive propaganda of the enemy of peace as much as possible, so that all actions of the warmongers to undermine peace cannot escape the eyes and ears of the people.

From this perspective, the gains of this peace conference are very significant. From the speeches and discussions of representatives from various countries, everyone's understanding has become consistent, and they have seen who wants war and who wants peace.

Let's give some concrete facts. For example, the fact that American imperialism is carrying out bacteriological warfare, although some Western scientists have believed it, and some have even come to investigate and made reports, there are still many others who refuse to believe it to this day. Needless to say, some degenerate American scientists are still desperately trying to cover up and deny it for the American rulers. However, at this conference, not only were there statements from twenty-seven scientists and medical workers from thirteen countries condemning the American government for carrying out bacteriological warfare, but the "Message to the People of the World," the "Letter to the United Nations," and the "Resolution on the Korean Question" all mentioned the American government's crimes of carrying out bacteriological warfare in Korea and China. These resolution documents were unanimously adopted at the meeting, indicating that all representatives had unanimously recognized that the American government's carrying out bacteriological warfare was an undeniable fact. This is the most significant evidence of a consistent and clear understanding. The representatives are serious, and some friends from countries under reactionary rule are prepared to go to jail upon their return. Therefore, we must not take the process by which they reached a consistent understanding lightly.

To give another example, it is the attitude of the representatives towards the United Nations and the World Peace Council. They put forward some urgent demands to the United Nations, and warned that the United Nations can only restore its lost prestige if it fulfills these demands; they expressed warm support for the World Peace Council. Of course, everyone still has high hopes for the United Nations, hoping that it can break free from the control of the enemies of peace and try to take on the responsibility of "saving mankind from the scourge of war." But whether the United Nations can do this depends on whether a large part of the countries in the United Nations can raise their vigilance against the American aggressive war policy for the sake of their own national interests, and gradually break free from the shackles of this policy. We believe that as long as the peace-loving people of all countries make persistent efforts to strive for this prospect, it can produce a significant effect.

Second, a high degree of democratic consultation was brought into play.

One of the greatest characteristics that runs through this entire conference is the high degree to which the spirit of democracy was brought into play.

This democratic spirit is first reflected in the organization of the conference. The executive chairmen of the conference were rotated by the presidium composed of sixty-three representatives from thirty-seven countries. In addition to one secretary-general, there were seven deputy secretaries-general, who were respectively from eight representatives of eight countries, jointly performing their duties.

The eight keynote reports and twelve supplementary reports submitted to the conference were respectively undertaken by twenty representatives of eighteen countries. In addition, each representative enjoyed unlimited rights to speak freely at the conference or in group meetings.

All the resolution documents of the conference were drafted after repeated consultations in eight subcommittees. These committees held fifty-nine meetings for this purpose. After the draft resolutions were unanimously passed in the group meetings, they were discussed and revised word by word by the presidium in a full-day meeting, achieving unanimous agreement. Finally, when submitted to the conference for a vote, the method of democratic consultation was still adopted, and finally a unanimous vote was obtained.

These processes were vividly unfolded before the representatives, making everyone happy and moved.

Another basic principle of the peace movement is to overcome the settlement by force with the spirit of consultation. From this perspective, we cannot but recognize the great achievement of this conference. It was precisely because of this high degree of democratic consultation that the entire conference, despite being extraordinarily intense and enthusiastic, was also extraordinarily friendly and harmonious. There were several scenes that moved the representatives to tears. We saw that the Korean representatives, the Vietnamese representatives, the Laotian representatives, and the Malayan representatives, who are sacrificing their blood to defend peace and national independence, were receiving extremely high respect at the conference. The American war criminals committed unprecedentedly brutal crimes against the Korean people, but the American delegation presented a evergreen tree to the Korean representatives. This tree will grow in Korean soil, symbolizing that the friendship between the Korean people and the American people will develop and flourish. We saw the French representative presenting flowers to the Vietnamese representative, and the British representative presenting flowers to the Malayan representative. Their mutual passionate embraces are truly in stark contrast to the incitement of national hatred by the warmongers.

The spirit of democratic consultation produced friendly unity. Another moving fact at the conference was the scene when the two delegations from India and Pakistan signed a joint statement on the Kashmir issue. The imperialists' provocation on this issue aimed to separate and cause bloodshed between the Indian and Pakistani peoples. In our peace conference, the result of the development of the spirit of democratic consultation and friendly unity was that the Indian representatives and the Pakistani representatives embraced and cried. If the Indian people and the Pakistani people can maintain this spirit of democratic consultation and friendly unity, and further continue to expand it, we believe that even bigger issues than the Kashmir issue can be resolved.

Third, urgent tasks for developing the peace movement in this region have been put forward.

I have already given a brief introduction to the contents of the eleven documents above. Here, I would like to talk about issues related to the purpose of the peace movement. As everyone knows, the peace movement is a democratic movement that struggles to defend peace. Its primary task is to stop existing wars and restore peace. The existing aggressive wars in this region, in Korea, in Vietnam, and in Malaya, have not only brought profound war disasters to the people of these countries, but also destroyed peace in the Far East and the world. Therefore, immediately stopping these aggressive wars in these regions and withdrawing all foreign troops from these regions has become the current urgent task of the Asian and Pacific Regions peace movement. This conference confirmed the importance of this task and stipulated the direction for realizing this task, which fully reflects the common wishes of the 1.6 billion people in this region.

Secondly, another important task of the peace movement is to prevent new wars and eliminate the threat of new wars. The American government's policy of violating the will of the Japanese people, turning Japan into its military base, and colluding with Japanese militarists to revive Japanese militarism, has deepened the major disasters of the Japanese people and created a serious threat to peace in Asia, the Pacific, and the world. This threat must be eliminated, and the recurrence of Japanese aggression must be prevented. This is another common wish of the people of Asia, the Pacific region, and the world. This conference not only expressed this common wish, but also pointed out the path to realizing this wish.

In addition, there is another issue related to the purpose of the peace movement, which is the issue of national independence. This issue, as clearly determined in the resolution, is indeed closely linked to peace and inseparable from it.

As everyone knows, the end of national oppression and national enslavement is a basic condition for the peaceful coexistence of all countries. If independent sovereignty is not respected, and if a country's internal affairs are arbitrarily interfered with by other countries, then peaceful coexistence is impossible. In the end, it will inevitably lead to war. However, in addition to waging war to interfere in Korea, and using the separate "peace treaty" with Japan and the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" to occupy Japan for a long time, seriously undermining Japanese national independence, the American government is also forcing some other countries to follow it in a frenzy of preparations for war, blockades and embargoes, arbitrarily interfering in other countries' internal affairs, and establishing military bases everywhere in other countries' territories. The movements for national independence and liberation in the colonies and dependent countries in the Asian and Pacific regions and in the Middle East and Africa are being brutally suppressed by the American government and its British and French vassal governments. Aggressive wars of various scales are happening everywhere. If this situation is allowed to continue and develop, then world peace cannot be ensured.

Therefore, this conference especially emphasized and put forward a resolution on the issue of national independence, requiring that "the sovereign independence and territorial integrity of all countries must be respected and inviolable." This resolution has been unanimously adopted by the whole meeting. It clearly points out that the violation of the national independence of other countries is a threat to world peace, and that respect for and guarantee of national independence are necessary conditions for strengthening world peace. This resolution supports the just struggle for national independence. The clear and firm expression of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference on this issue has not only accurately raised and advanced the peace movement in the Asian and Pacific Regions, but also the peace movement in the world, by a big step.

Fourth, international unity in the cause of peace has been enhanced.

We know that the purpose of convening this conference was to unite and mobilize the people of the Asian and Pacific regions to actively take action to oppose war and defend peace. Unity is strength. The scope of unity should be broad, because peace is the common wish of the people of all countries in the world, and there is only one enemy of peace, which is the warmongering group headed by the American government. All peace-loving people, regardless of their political views, religious beliefs, national differences, and professional types, should unite to fight against war and overthrow the warmongers. The basis of unity is the peaceful coexistence, equal exchanges, mutually beneficial trade, and cultural exchanges between people of various countries living under different political systems; it is the mutual understanding, trust, and friendly cooperation developed through these. One of the great achievements of this peace conference is that it has enhanced the unity of the people of all countries in the cause of peace. First, let us take our China as an example. Not only the Chinese delegation participating in the conference, not only all the comrades who directly participated in the work of the conference, but the people of the entire China all had the opportunity to interact with international friends, and thus established a preliminary mutual understanding. We realize that no matter how different the political systems between countries are, how different the lifestyles are, and how different the national differences, religious beliefs, and political views are, everyone's mutual respect is consistent, everyone's understanding of the purpose of peace is consistent, and everyone's sense of responsibility for the cause of peace is consistent. It is precisely because of this that we Chinese people have gained an unprecedentedly favorable opportunity to deepen our profound friendship with the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions.

Furthermore, from the perspective of international friends, their hopes for understanding China have also been met. They have seen the reality of China's peaceful construction, so they understand how much we love peace and oppose war, and thus recognize that we and they are close friends. Through this conference, mutual understanding, sympathy, and support among the people of various countries in Asia and the Pacific have also been enhanced. The joint statement of the Indian and Pakistani delegations, the respect of representatives from various countries for the heroic struggle of the Korean, Vietnamese, and Malayan people, and the sympathy and support expressed by the conference for the American people and the Japanese people in the "Message to the People of the World" all fully prove this point. The importance of this event, the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, has made the enemies of peace feel alarmed. Although they are doing their best to distort, slander, block, and restrict, even semi-official American newspapers such as "The New York Times" have to warn themselves: "It would be a mistake to think that this conference is not important at all." The Yoshida puppet government of Japan, which is ordered to obey orders, has taken the lead in accepting this warning, and has issued arrest warrants for the Japanese representatives who attended this conference, preparing to use high-handed means to suppress the Japanese people's demands for peace. Just as Chiang Kai-shek once created a law "patriotism is a crime" in China, the American government has now created a new law, which is "peace is a crime." Can peace really be locked up in prison? No! Absolutely impossible. On the contrary, the unity of the people of all countries in the cause of peace is unshakable and indestructible.

(IV)

The reasons why this conference was able to achieve such great success are worth analyzing carefully.

First, this conference was convened on the basis of the strong development of the world peace camp.

The Soviet Union, the leader and strong fortress of the peace camp, has made remarkable achievements in peaceful construction towards communism. Taking the rising speed of production as an example, in the twenty-two years from 1929 to 1951, the Soviet Union's production has increased thirteenfold, while the United States, the leader of the aggressive camp, has only relied on war preparations and war supplies to increase production twofold during the same period. Other vassal states, such as Britain and France, are stuck in a stagnant phase. The Soviet Union's achievements in science, culture, and art are also very significant. Soviet society has achieved a high degree of unity in spirit and politics. The great Soviet people are actively striving in various fields of Soviet life to consolidate world peace, setting a brilliant example for the world peace movement and encouraging the strong development of the peace movement.

The various people's democratic countries, and the peace-loving people of all countries, encouraged by the victory of the Soviet Union, the defender of peace, have made brilliant achievements in all aspects. Our Chinese people's great victories in domestic construction and resisting America and aiding Korea in the past three years have, needless to say, also contributed to increasing the strength of the peace camp.

The entire peace and democracy camp, firmly united under the leadership of the great Soviet Union, is increasingly developing into a huge force, unprecedented in history and invincible. This force firmly opposes war and defends peace.

A great difference has taken place in the balance of power between the world peace camp and the aggressive camp. On the one hand, the strength of the peace camp is rapidly rising, and on the other hand, the strength of the aggressive camp is rapidly declining. After the two world wars, the imperialist group has been greatly weakened. The current war policy adopted by the United States has increased the profits of the big American capitalists. The profit income of 42.9 billion US dollars in 1951 has increased thirteenfold compared to the 3.3 billion US dollars in 1938. However, during the same period, the burden of direct taxes on the American people has also increased twelvefold. This in fact shows that the American war policy is a policy of drinking poison to quench thirst. It has deepened the contradictions between the American ruling group and the American people, deepened the contradictions between the imperialist groups, especially the contradictions between the United States and Britain, and further deepened the contradictions between the American government and the people of all countries in the world. The American arms expansion and war preparation have affected the lives of the people of capitalist countries; the blockade and embargo have shrunk the production and trade of capitalist countries; and the revival of Japanese and West German militarism, the expansion of military bases everywhere, the interference in other countries' internal affairs, and the violation of other countries' sovereignty have aroused strong opposition and resistance from the people of all countries. Especially in the war of aggression against Korea, the American government has revealed its vulnerability and unparalleled brutality.

It is the difference in this balance of power that has made the people of the world gradually recognize the truth of the international situation and generate confidence that peace will surely win. This has made the world peace movement develop continuously in the past three years. The fundamental reason why our conference was able to achieve such great success is because the conference was convened on such a victorious foundation.

Secondly, this conference was convened on the basis of the victorious development of the world peace movement. Since its inception, the world peace movement has striven to unite all peace-loving people under the banner of peace. It is a broad mass movement. The World Peace Congress, based on this goal, launched the Stockholm Appeal and the Declaration on Concluding a Peace Pact among the Five Major Powers. More than 500 million people signed the first declaration, and more than 600 million people signed the second declaration. These facts fully show the huge scale of the victorious development of the world peace movement. Now, every country has a peace organization. This Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference was not only jointly mobilized and organized by the peace organizations of various countries, but was also decided to be convened at the first meeting of the World Peace Council in February last year. After careful and long-term deliberation, we officially initiated preparations in March of this year. After the success of the preparatory meeting in early June, we paved the way for this formal conference to achieve greater success.

Looking at it today, the scope of the Asian and Pacific Regions is so broad, and the peace movement is the common cause of 1.6 billion people. Without the world peace movement that has been actively fighting to defend peace for the past three years, without the widespread development of this movement and the support it has won from all peace-loving people, without the widespread awakening of 1.6 billion people in this situation and their determination to work for peace, then this conference would never have been able to achieve such great success. The facts tell us that even before this conference, the peace movements of various countries had made considerable progress, and the success of this conference was built on the foundation of the development of the peace movements of various countries.

For example, in Japan, after the preparatory meeting in June, in order to elect representatives to the formal conference, a movement to nominate representatives was launched in various prefectures across the country, and they elected a total of 488 candidates. For example, in India, in order to prepare for this conference, a series of peace rallies were held in almost every province of India, and more than 200 candidates were elected. Other countries generally have the same situation. It can be seen that the success of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is inseparable from the development of the world peace movement.

(V)

The conference has ended victoriously, but new work is beginning. We Chinese people must engage in these tasks with even more enthusiasm.

We have the responsibility, together with the people of other countries in this region, to realize the various resolutions produced by the conference one by one. We must further assist in enhancing the great unity of 1.6 billion people on the basis of the conference's achieved victories, and strive to expand the peace movement in this region and around the world, and mobilize and unite the vast number of people to oppose war and defend peace.

The World People's Peace Congress in December is already imminent. The World Peace Council has great expectations for us, and peace-loving people around the world are mobilizing for this great event. To implement the resolutions of the conference, we must fully prepare for the work of supporting the World People's Peace Congress. We should redouble our efforts to prepare, and "send delegations with the broadest possible representation to attend" the congress, so as to make the greatest contribution to advancing the work of the world peace movement.

Needless to say, our movement to resist America and aid Korea will continue to be strengthened. Since the American aggressors are determined to undermine the armistice negotiations and prepare to expand the war, we must strengthen our movement to increase production and practice thrift to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, and give the enemy an even heavier blow. We must regularize our patriotic health movement to completely crush the American aggressors' inhumane bacteriological warfare.

We must strengthen our support for the Japanese people's struggle for independence, freedom, peace, and democracy; expand trade and cultural exchanges with the people of various countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit; support women's rights and promote children's welfare; and strive for the realization of the conclusion of a peace pact among the five major powers. But these tasks are inseparable from our national construction work. After three years of restoration and transformation, our national defense has been strengthened, the foundation of the people's democratic dictatorship has been laid, and the financial and economic situation has been fundamentally improved. Now, large-scale construction work is unfolding before us. We must make further efforts to take on the work tasks in our respective positions. If China's construction develops rapidly, the strength of the peace camp will be rapidly strengthened, and peace will have a better guarantee.

Finally, I must also draw the attention of all of you, esteemed guests, comrades, and the people of the entire nation. The All-China Federation of Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations is preparing to hold the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" from November 7th to December 6th to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the great Soviet October Socialist Revolution, to enhance the friendly cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union, to promote our national construction, and to consolidate peace in the Far East and the world. This activity is about to begin in an instant. A delegation and song and dance troupe of famous Soviet cultural, scientific, and artistic workers has arrived in Beijing. This is another large-scale internationalist learning movement for us. All of us Chinese people should concentrate our efforts to do this new task well.

Here, we would like to suggest to the people of the whole country: please, all production units, learning units, and work units across the country, use the spare time for production, learning, and work in the near future to hold small gatherings, combine the achievements of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference with the publicity work of "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," make widespread dissemination, discuss ways to implement the various resolutions of the peace conference, and at the same time discuss the significance of the World People's Peace Congress in December. It is imperative that the people of the whole country should be aware of the importance of uniting international friends, especially knowing that the unity of the people of China and the Soviet Union is a strong guarantee for world peace.

Please allow me to repeat Chairman Mao's instructions at the opening of the People's Political Consultative Conference three years ago:

"As long as we adhere to the people's democratic dictatorship and unite with international friends, we will always be victorious." (Xinhua News Agency)

    关于亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的报告
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席
    中国出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议代表团副团长  郭沫若
    主席、各位先生、各位同志：
    关于亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议所获得的成就和我们今后所应该做的工作，我现在代表出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的中国代表团，向各位先生、各位同志，并向全国人民提出报告。（一）
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议是十月二日在北京开幕，十月十三日早晨三时闭幕的，一共举行了十一天的会议。会议始终在和谐友好、热烈紧张的气氛中进行，获得了圆满的成就，对于动员亚洲及太平洋区域人民和全世界人民进行保卫和平的事业作了重大的贡献。
    首先我们应该指出，各国代表到会十分踊跃。虽然亚洲及太平洋区域十分广阔，交通相当困难，和平的敌人又进行封锁、阻挠、破坏，可是，这些都没有影响到和平代表们的坚强的意志。在亚洲及太平洋区域的国家中，除掉阿富汗没有得到联系，尼泊尔代表团没有得到出国护照，高棉代表在途中生病未能到会之外，一共有三十七个国家派遣了代表团来参加大会，正式代表总数是三百六十七人，列席代表三十七人。属于亚洲的有二十二国，是中国、苏联、朝鲜、蒙古、越南、寮国、缅甸、印度、巴基斯坦、锡兰、泰国、马来亚、印尼、菲律宾、日本、伊朗、土耳其、伊拉克、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、以色列和塞浦路斯。属于澳洲的有两国，是澳大利亚和新西兰。属于美洲太平洋沿岸的有十三国，是加拿大、美国、墨西哥、危地马拉、洪都拉斯、萨尔瓦多、尼加拉瓜、哥斯达黎加、巴拿马、哥伦比亚、厄瓜多尔、秘鲁和智利。此外还有非洲阿尔及利亚的特邀代表，南美洲大西洋区域巴西的特邀代表，欧洲的英国和法国的特邀代表；还有九个国际团体——世界和平理事会、世界工会联合会、世界工联亚澳联络局、教育工会国际、国际民主妇女联合会、国际民主法律工作者协会、世界民主青年联盟、国际学生联合会、国际新闻工作者协会——的特邀代表到会。特邀代表、正式代表和列席代表，一共是四百二十九位。假使依据代表的国籍来说，一共有四十六个国家。
    代表的代表性是充分广泛的，代表了不同的民族和种族，不同的阶层和职业，不同的宗教信仰和政治见解。这里有世界知名的科学家、作家、诗人、艺术家、新闻工作者；有工人、农民、妇女、青年的代表；有著名的工商业家、著名的宗教界领袖；有各种党派的负责人、国会议员、在政府中担任着或担任过重要职务的人士。他们有的是代表着本国的和平组织或各种人民团体的，有的是经过全国各地盛大的和平集会所选举出来的，正因如此，所以亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议就有充分的理由，宣告自己是代表着全亚洲及太平洋区域的十六亿的人民。
    有许多国家的代表，他们能够到会，是很不容易的。他们在到会之前已经遭遇到种种的困难，回国之后可能还会遭遇到更大的困难。许多代表们都异口同声地说，他们是通过了或者避开了美国的封锁而来到北京的，例如美洲的代表们，就由于美国在海上的封锁，不能够直接从太平洋，而需要绕道欧洲才能来到中国。美国政府是敌视和平运动，敌视我们的会议的。它不仅禁止美国的和平代表出国，而且迫使亚洲、澳洲和拉丁美洲的某些国家的政府采取了同样的行动。然而尽管美国政府和一些追随它的别国政府用尽了阻挠、破坏、诬蔑、恫吓等等手段，但美国、日本、澳大利亚、泰国和拉丁美洲许多国家的代表们，却依然胜利地来到了北京。特别是日本人民和日本代表们在争取参加这个会议的顽强斗争中，表现了异常的英勇和机智。他们的行动给了大会以莫大的鼓舞。他们赢得了参加大会的全体人员的尊敬和赞扬。
    代表要护照，和平是不要护照的。任何天然的阻碍和人为的封锁，都隔断不了真理的传播，隔断不了世界人民爱好和平的愿望和团结友好的要求。即如尼泊尔代表团虽然没有可能到会，但大会所收到的三万八千二百四十一件贺电、贺信中，就有全尼泊尔和平委员会从尼泊尔的首都——加德满都发来的一通贺电。电文里有这样的话：
    “当你们听到我们不能够参加即将在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议时，你们可能感到惊异和苦恼。……然而，我们之间比以前任何时候，都更加接近了。世界上没有任何障碍，能够破坏我们之间的团结、亲爱和友谊的联系。我们感觉到我们是和你们在一起开和平会议，为崇高的世界和平事业而团结在一起。……我们代表全体爱好和平的尼泊尔人发出这通贺电，我们同声地表示拥护这个会议。……”
    这是从喜马拉雅山南麓、世界最高峰珠穆郎玛峰下所发出来的人民的声音，也是全世界爱好和平人民的共同的声音，这是任何邪恶的“美国之音”所不能扰乱的。
    代表们的发言也十分踊跃。在十一天的大会上，作主题报告的八人，作补充报告的十二人，作正式发言的八十八人。如果再加上向大会致词、发表声明、宣读抗议电文，则在这次大会上发言的一共有一百一十五人。八个小组会上的发言，主席团会议上的发言，人数更多。我们可以肯定地说，在大会和小会上，每一个国家都有代表发言。大家的发言差不多都做到了“知无不言，言无不尽”的地步。这也充分反映了各国人民对于和平的殷切愿望。
    印度代表团团长赛福丁·克其鲁博士在他所作的大会闭幕词中有几句话说得很好，他说：
    “请回顾一下过去的那几天，请想一想那些讨论——往往几乎像是永远不会完的讨论，那些争论——有时可不是很平和的；请想一想见解很不相同的人们在每一个可能的问题上意见的交换和分歧；那些决议、声明、宣言和呼吁书的反复起草——一次、又一次、再一次……
    请想一想这一切，然后根据这种情况，再来看今天我们在每一个决议上所表现的令人惊叹的意见一致的情形。
    在世界的任何其他一个讲坛上，也能够达成这样一种协议和相互谅解吗？我说，不能够。只有和平运动才能够完成这样的奇迹。只有和平运动才能够以这种弥漫着整个会议的光辉的友好与合作的精神来鼓舞我们每一个人。”
    是的，大会的顺利进行的确有点类似乎“奇迹”。那样多的代表来自那样多的国家，代表性既十分广泛，发言的情况又异常踊跃，然而却得到共同一致的明确的认识。十一天的会议所得到的十一项重要决议，都是全场一致地通过的，没有一个人反对，也没有一个人弃权。
    （二）
    我们请把十一项决议的内容来说明一下吧。
    首先是“告世界人民书”。这是一个总的纲领。在这里庄严地表明了“亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民坚持着共同的目标，就是反对战争，保卫和平”。在这里重申了十六亿人民的坚定的信心，相信“具有不同社会制度和生活方式的国家是能够和平共处、互利合作的”。
    在这里更明确地宣布了“美国政府在本区域和世界其它地区进行战争与准备战争的行为，对于亚洲及太平洋区域人民以及全世界的人民都是深重的祸害”。因此，针对着这些祸害，这里便提出了保卫本区域和平与世界和平的六项基本要求：“一、立即在公平合理的基础上，实现朝鲜停战；结束越南、马来亚及其他地区的战争；并从这些地区撤退一切外国军队。
    二、制止日本军国主义复活；缔结有关各国与日本之间的真正和约；建立独立、民主、自由与和平的新日本。
    三、反对一个国家干涉另一个国家的内政；反对一个国家侵犯另一个国家的主权；保卫并实现民族独立。
    四、反对封锁和禁运；在平等互利基础上促进各国间的经济合作和文化交流。
    五、禁止煽动战争；反对种族歧视；保护妇女权利，增进儿童福利。
    六、迅速缔结五大国和平公约；实行裁减军备，禁止使用原子武器、细菌武器、化学武器以及其他大规模屠杀的武器。”
    这些要求是合情合理的，不仅是亚洲及太平洋区域十六亿人民的要求，同时也是全世界——包括美国在内——的爱好和平的人民的共同要求。
    在这里，对于美国人民更作出了特别恳切的呼吁：
    “美国人民的迫切的需要和庄严的任务就是：担当起责任来制止他们政府的这些行为，并把他们的国家引到和平的道路。”
    其次是“致联合国书”，在大体上也表达了同样的要求，并因为西德的问题关系到世界的和平与安全，故在要求中把关于德国的统一问题和关于日本问题的建议同时提出了。必须指出，“致联合国书”的主要用意，是在对联合国提出要求和警告。联合国已经堕落成为了美国掩饰侵略的工具，全世界人民都在要求它“恢复它已失去的威信，而成为维持世界和平的权威机构”。
    此外关于日本问题、朝鲜问题、民族独立问题、文化交流、经济交流、妇女权利与儿童福利、以及加紧争取五大国缔结和平公约运动等七项决议，更是把“告世界人民书”和“致联合国书”中的见解和要求分别地作了简明扼要的阐述。这七项决议和两项宣言式的呼吁书，可以说是这一次的大会为亚洲及太平洋区域和平运动所制定的共同纲领。把十六亿人民的共同意志凝结成为了这九项文件，不仅可以使今后本区域各国人民的和平运动有所遵循，而且对于全世界的和平运动也会有重大的贡献。无疑，这要算是这一次和平会议的最大的成就。
    当然，我们不能忘记，在这之外还有两项重大的决议。那便是“关于拥护召开世界人民和平大会的决议”和“关于建立亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会的决议”。
    由世界和平理事会所号召的世界人民和平大会，今年十二月将要在奥地利的京城维也纳召开。这是保卫世界和平运动中的一件大事。自从今年七月世界和平理事会柏林特别会议作出这个决定以来，世界和平理事会常务委员会和各国的和平组织已经在全世界范围内进行广泛的动员。这次我们亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议也为此而作出了一个明确的决议，拥护世界人民和平大会的召开，并号召本区域各国人民积极筹备和参加。在这里，我们可以看到一个明确的立场：亚洲和太平洋区域十六亿人民，和所有爱好和平的人民一样，愿意把他们的和平愿望寄托在世界爱好和平人民的大团结上。
    “关于建立亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会的决议”是同等重要的。这个决议，不仅要加强本区域各国人民间和平运动的联系，促进实现本次会议的各项决议；同时还要与世界和平理事会联系，支持世界和平理事会关于世界和平的号召。因此，这个联络委员会的建立必然会大大有助于世界和平理事会的工作。值得特别提及的，是这一项决议在十一项决议中最早地得到实现。联络委员会在十月十五日已经正式成立；设主席一人、副主席十一人、委员六十九人；秘书长一人、副秘书长七人。我国代表团团长宋庆龄先生被选为主席，刘宁一先生被选为秘书长。委员会和秘书处设在北京。这样，在推动和组织亚洲及太平洋区域和平运动的任务中，我们中国人民就担负了一份重大责任，我们应该加倍努力。
    （三）
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议是有很大的成就的。它扩大了亚洲及太平洋区域和平运动的基础，为本区域的和平运动制定了共同遵守的纲领，建立了本区域和平运动的经常的联络机构，并为十二月的世界人民和平大会作了大规模的动员工作。这些都是很具体、很显著的收获。但在这些具体收获中所含蓄着的意义，我想在这里，就我所见到的，提出四项来，特别申述一下。
    第一、认清了和平敌人的真面目
    在大会的各项报告和各国代表的重要发言中，特别是在各项决议文件里面，一致明确地指出了美国政府进行战争与准备战争的行为是对于本区域和平与世界和平的严重威胁。
    美国政府虽然明目张胆地在进行侵略、准备战争，但它经常在使用着“贼喊捉贼”的惯技，把自己粉饰成为和平与自由的保卫者，而把苏联和我们中国诬蔑为“侵略国家”。它企图用这种欺骗办法来欺骗蒙混其本国的和一些别的国家的人民，以便把他们拖入战争。因此，和平运动的一个基本原则就是要尽量揭破和平的敌人的欺骗宣传，使战争贩子一切破坏和平的行动都不能逃过人民的耳目。
    这一次的和平会议，从这一个尺度上看来，收获是很重大的。从各国代表的发言和讨论中，大家的认识已趋于一致，看到了谁要战争，谁要和平。
    举些具体的事实来说吧。例如，美帝国主义进行细菌战这一事实，虽然有些西方科学家是相信了的，有的人还亲自来调查，作了报告，但是，另外还有好些人却一直到现在都还不肯相信，美国某些堕落的科学家们，不用说，还在拚命地替美国统治者掩饰和抵赖。但在这一次的会议中，不仅又有了十三个国家二十七位科学与医学工作者谴责美国政府进行细菌战的声明，而且在“告世界人民书”、“致联合国书”和“关于朝鲜问题的决议”中都讲到了美国政府在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的罪行。这些决议文件在会场一致通过，表明全体代表已一致认识了美国政府进行细菌战是一个无可置疑的事实。这就是一致的明确认识的最显著的证据。代表们是严肃的，有好些从反动统治的国度里来的朋友，他们已准备回国坐牢。因此，他们得到一致认识的过程，我们决不能视同等闲。
    再举一个例，就是代表们对于联合国与世界和平理事会的态度。他们对联合国是提出了一些迫切的要求，并警告联合国只有实现了这些要求，才能挽回它已丧失的威信；他们对于世界和平理事会是表示热烈的支持。当然，大家对于联合国依然是寄以殷切的希望的，希望它能够从和平的敌人的控制中摆脱出来，而试行担负起“拯救人类免于战祸”的责任。但联合国是否能够这样做，就要看联合国中很大一部分国家是否能够为了他们本国的利益而对美国的侵略战争政策提高警惕，并逐渐摆脱这个政策的羁绊。我们相信，只要各国爱好和平的人民为争取这一前途而作持久的努力，那就是能够产生重大的作用。
    第二、发挥了高度的民主协商精神
    贯串着这次整个会议的最大特色之一，是高度地发挥了民主精神。
    这种民主精神首先表现在会议的组织上。会议的执行主席是由三十七个国家的六十三位代表所组成的主席团来轮流担任的。一位秘书长之外还有七位副秘书长，由八个国家的八位代表分别担任，共同执行职务。
    向大会提出的八个主题报告和十二个补充报告，是由十八个国家的二十位代表分别担任的。此外，每一位代表都享有无限制的权利，得在大会上或小组会上，自由发言。
    大会的全部决议文件是在八个小组委员会中经过了反复磋商而后草成的。这些委员会为此曾举行了五十九次会议。决议草案在小组会上一致通过之后，经过主席团的整日会议，字斟句酌地加以讨论和修改，取得了一致同意。最后提到大会表决时，仍然采取了民主协商方式，终于得到了全体一致的投票。
    这些过程，形象地展开在代表们的面前，使大家高兴，也使大家感动。
    和平运动的另一个基本原则，就是以协商精神战胜武力解决。从这一个尺度上来看，我们也不能不承认这一次会议的伟大成就。正是由于有这样高度的民主协商精神，所以整个会议尽管异常地紧张热烈，但同时却也异常地友好和谐。有好些场面曾使得代表们感动得热泪横流。我们看到正为保卫和平和民族独立而不惜流血牺牲的朝鲜代表、越南代表、寮国代表、马来亚代表，在大会上受着极高度的尊敬。美国的战争罪犯们对朝鲜人民犯下了史无先例的残暴的罪行，然而美国人民的代表团却向朝鲜代表们捧献了一株常青树。这树将在朝鲜国土上发育起来，象征着朝鲜人民与美国人民的友谊将发展滋荣。我们看到法国代表向越南代表献花，英国代表向马来亚代表献花。他们的相互激情的热烈拥抱，和战争贩子们的民族仇恨的煽动真真是极其鲜明的对照。
    民主协商的精神产生了友好团结。在大会上另一个动人的事实便是印度和巴基斯坦两个代表团签订关于克什米尔问题的联合声明时的场面。帝国主义者在这个问题上的挑拨离间，目的在使印度人民和巴基斯坦人民分离而流血。在我们这次的和平会议中，民主协商、友好团结的精神的发扬的结果，却使印度代表和巴基斯坦代表拥抱流泪。印度人民和巴基斯坦人民如果能够保持着这种民主协商、友好团结的精神，并进一步继续扩大下去，我们相信，就是比克什米尔问题更大的问题也是可以得到解决的。
    第三、提出了在本区域发展和平运动的迫切任务
    我在前面已就十一项文件的内容作了简略的介绍。在这里，我想谈一谈与和平运动目的有关的问题。大家知道，和平运动是一个为了保卫和平而斗争的民主运动。它的首要任务是制止现存的战争，恢复和平。本区域现存的、在朝鲜的、在越南马来亚的各个侵略战争，不但给这些国家的人民带来了深重的战争灾难，而且破坏了远东和世界的和平，因此，立即停止这些地区的侵略战争，从这些地区撤退一切外国军队，便成了亚洲和太平洋区域和平运动当前的紧急任务。这次会议确认了这一任务的重要性，并规定了实现这任务的方针，这就充分反映了本区域十六亿人民的共同愿望。
    其次，和平运动的另一重要任务就是防止新的战争，消除新战争的威胁。美国政府违反日本人民的意志、变日本为其军事基地、并与日本军国主义分子勾结、使日本军国主义复活的政策，已经加深了日本人民的重大灾难，并造成了对亚洲、太平洋及世界和平的严重威胁。这种威胁是必须消除的，日本侵略的重演是必须防止的，这是亚洲、太平洋区域和全世界人民的另一个共同愿望。这次会议不仅表达了这个共同愿望，并且指出了实现这个愿望的道路。
    此外，还有一个与和平运动的目的有关的问题，那便是民族独立问题。这个问题，如决议中所明白断定，确是与和平密切联系而不可分的。
    大家都知道，民族压迫和民族奴役的结束，是各国和平共处的基本条件。独立主权如不受尊重，国家内政如果横被他国干涉，那就无法和平共处。最后必然还会导向战争，可是美国政府除了进行干涉朝鲜的战争，并利用单独对日“和约”和“美日安全条约”长期占领日本，严重破坏日本民族独立外，还正在强迫其他一些国家跟随着它疯狂地进行备战，封锁禁运，任意干涉别国内政和在别国的领土内到处建立军事基地。亚洲及太平洋区域以及中东非洲的各殖民地附属国的民族独立和解放运动正在遭受着美国政府及其英法仆从政府的残酷镇压。大小规模的侵略战争正在到处发生。如果听任这种情势继续并发展下去，那么，世界和平是无法确保的。
    所以这次会议特别强调地提出了关于民族独立问题的决议案，要求“各国的主权独立与领土完整必须受到尊重而不容侵犯”。这决议业已获得了全场一致的通过。它明白地指出：对于别国民族独立的侵犯是对世界和平的威胁，而对于民族独立的尊重和保障则是加强世界和平的必要条件。这个决议支持争取民族独立的正义斗争。亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议在这个问题上的明确而坚定的表示，不仅把亚洲及太平洋区域的、而且也把世界的和平运动确切地提高了并且推进了一大步。
    第四、增强了和平事业中的国际团结
    我们知道，召开这次会议的目的，就是要团结和动员亚洲及太平洋区域的人民，积极行动起来，反对战争，保卫和平。团结就是力量。团结的范围要广，因为和平是全世界各国人民的共同愿望，而和平的敌人只有一个，即以美国政府为首的战争贩子集团。一切爱好和平的人民，不分政治见解、宗教信仰、民族差别和职业种类，都应该团结起来，为反对战争、打倒战争贩子而斗争。团结的基础就是生活在不同政治制度下的各国人民之间的和平相处、平等往来、互利通商、文化交流；就是通过这些而发展的相互了解、信任和友好合作。这次和平会议的伟大成就之一，就是增强了各国人民在和平事业中的团结。先就我们中国来说，不仅参加会议的中国代表团，不仅直接参加了会议工作的全体同志，就是全中国的人民，这次都得到机会和国际友人交往，并因此而建立了初步的相互了解。我们认识到不论各国间的政治制度如何不同，生活方式如何不同，民族差别、宗教信仰和政治见解又如何不同，但大家的相互尊重却是一致的，大家对于和平宗旨的了解是一致的，对于和平事业的责任感是一致的。正是这样，我们中国人民获得一次空前有利的机会，使我们和亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民增进了深厚友谊。
    再从国际友人方面来说，他们对于了解中国的希望也得到了满足。他们看到中国和平建设的实际，就明白我们是如何地热爱和平，反对战争，从而也就认识了我们和他们是亲密的朋友。通过这次会议，也在亚洲和太平洋各国人民之间增进了相互之间的了解、同情和支持。印度和巴基斯坦代表团的联合声明，各国代表对于英勇斗争的朝鲜、越南、马来亚人民的尊重，大会在“告世界人民书”中表示的对于美国人民和日本人民的同情和支持，这些都充分证明了这一点。亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议这一事件的重要性，已使和平的敌人感觉着惊慌了。尽管他们在尽力地歪曲、诬蔑、封锁、限制，但甚至就是“纽约时报”那种美国半官方的报纸也不得不向他们自己提出警告：“如果认为这个会议毫不重要，那就将是一个错误”。奉命唯谨的日本吉田傀儡政府已经带头接受了这个警告，对于出席这次会议的日本代表们已经下了逮捕令，准备用高压手段镇压日本人民的和平要求。就如蒋匪介石曾经在中国制造过一条法律“爱国有罪”一样，美国政府现在又制造了一条新的法律，便是“和平有罪”。和平真能够被关进监狱里去吗？不！绝不可能。正相反，各国人民在和平事业中的团结是不可动摇不可破坏的。
    （四）
    这一次的会议之所以能够获得这样伟大成就的原因值得我们仔细地加以分析。
    首先，这次会议是在世界和平阵营强大发展的基础上召开的。
    和平阵营的领导者和坚强堡垒的苏联，在走向共产主义的和平建设方面已有了有目共睹的伟大成就。单拿生产量的上升速度来说，从一九二九年到一九五一年的二十二年间，苏联的生产量已经增加到十三倍，而在侵略阵营的领导者美国在同一期间，却仅仅靠着战争准备和战争供应，使生产量增加到两倍。其它仆从国家如像英国和法国都陷在停顿的阶段。苏联在科学、文化和艺术各方面的成就也是非常巨大的。苏维埃社会在精神上和政治上已经取得了高度的团结。伟大的苏联人民正在苏维埃生活的各个领域中为巩固世界和平而积极奋斗，为全世界的和平运动树立光辉的榜样，鼓舞着和平运动的强大发展。
    各人民民主国家，和各国爱好和平的人民，在和平的保卫者、强大的苏联的胜利鼓舞下，在各方面都有了辉煌的成就。我们中国人民三年来在国内建设与抗美援朝等方面的伟大胜利，不用说在增加和平阵营的力量上也是有贡献的。
    整个和平民主阵营，巩固地团结在伟大苏联的领导下，正在日益发展成为历史上空前的、不可战胜的巨大力量。这个力量坚强地反对战争，保卫和平。
    世界和平阵营与侵略阵营在力量对比上已经发生极大的差异。一方面是和平阵营力量的快速上升，另一方面是侵略阵营力量的快速下降。两次世界大战后，帝国主义集团是大大地削弱了。在目前美国所采取的战争政策，使美国大资本家们的利润增加了，一九五一年的四二九亿美元利润所得，比起一九三八年的三三亿美元是增加到十三倍，可是，在同一期间，美国人民直接税的负担却也就增加了十二倍。这在事实上表明着美国的战争政策是饮鸩止渴的政策。它加深了美国统治集团与美国人民之间的矛盾，加深了帝国主义集团之间的矛盾，特别是美英之间的矛盾，更加深了美国政府与世界各国人民之间的矛盾。美国的扩军备战影响了资本主义各国人民的生活；封锁禁运萎缩了资本主义国家的生产与贸易；复活日本与西德的军国主义、到处扩充军事基地、干涉别国内政与侵犯别国主权，引起了各国人民的强烈反对和抵抗。特别在侵略朝鲜的战争中，美国政府更把它的脆弱性与无比的残暴性暴露无遗了。
    是这种力量对比的差异使世界人民逐渐认识了国际局势的真相，并生出了和平必胜的信心。这就使得三年来的世界和平运动有了不断的发展。我们这一次会议能够获得这样伟大的成就，它的根本原因，就因为会议是在这样胜利的基础之上召开的。
    其次，这次会议是在世界和平运动胜利发展的基础上召开的。世界和平运动自从开始发动以来，就力求在和平的旗帜下团结一切爱好和平的人民。它是一个广泛的群众运动。世界保卫和平大会本着这个目标发起了斯德哥尔摩宣言和缔结五大国和平公约宣言。在头一个宣言上签名的有五亿余人，在第二个宣言上签名的有六亿多人。这些事实充分显示了世界和平运动胜利发展的巨大规模。现在，每个国家都有和平组织。这一次的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议不仅由各国和平组织共同担任着动员与组织的工作，并且还是去年二月世界和平理事会第一届会议上决定召开的。我们经过了慎重的、长期的酝酿，一直到今年三月才正式发起筹备。再经过六月初筹备会议的成功，才为这一次的正式会议开拓出了获得更大成功的道路。
    在今天看来，亚洲和太平洋区域的范围这样宽广，而和平运动又是十六亿人民大众的共同的事情，如果没有三年以来为了保卫和平而进行积极斗争的世界和平运动，如果没有这一运动的广泛发展和它所赢得的所有爱好和平人民的支持，如果没有十六亿人民在这一形势之下的广泛觉醒，和决心为和平而努力，那么，这次大会是决不可能有这么大的成就的。事实告诉我们，就在这一次的会议之前，各国的和平运动都有了长足的进展，而这次会议的成功正是建筑在各国和平运动的发展这一基础上面的。
    例如日本，在六月的筹备会议之后，为了选举正式会议的代表在全国各府县展开了推选代表的运动，他们一共选出了四百八十八位候选人。又例如在印度，为了准备这次会议，几乎在印度的每一个省份都举行了一连串的和平集会，选出二百多位候选人。其他各国，大体上都有同样的情形。可见亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的成功是与世界和平运动的发展分不开的。
    （五）
    会议是胜利地结束了，但新的工作正在开始。我们中国人民必须以更饱满的精神来从事这些工作。
    会议所产生的各项决议，我们有责任和本区域其他各国人民一道，来使它们逐一地实现。我们要在会议既得的胜利基础之上，更进一步地协助增强十六亿人民的大团结，为在本区域和全世界扩大和平运动、动员和团结广大人民起来反对战争、保卫和平而奋斗。
    十二月的世界人民和平大会已经迫到眼前来了。世界和平理事会对于我们有很大的期待，全世界爱好和平的人们都在为这一伟大事件而进行动员。我们要实现会议的决议，就必须使支持世界人民和平大会的工作充分做好。我们应该加倍努力筹备，应该“派遣有尽量广泛代表性的代表团去出席”大会，以便对推进世界和平运动的工作能够作出最大的贡献。
    我们的抗美援朝运动不用说还要继续加强。美国侵略者既存心破坏停战谈判，准备扩大战争，我们就必须加强我们的增产节约运动来支持中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，给予敌人以更沉重的打击。我们就必须使我们的爱国卫生运动经常化，来彻底粉碎美国侵略者灭绝人性的细菌战。
    我们要加强支持对日本人民争取独立、自由、和平、民主的斗争，要扩大在平等互利的基础上的与各国人民的通商贸易与文化交流；要拥护妇女的权利并增进儿童的福利；要争取五大国缔结和平公约的实现。但这些工作都和我们的国家建设工作是分不开来的。我们的国家经过三年的恢复改造，国防是增强了，人民民主专政的基础是已经奠定了，财政经济状况是已经根本好转，现在大规模的建设工作正展开在我们的面前。我们要更进一步地努力，来担负起我们各个岗位上的工作任务。中国的建设如果迅速发展，和平阵营的力量便迅速加强，和平便有了更好的保障。
    最后我还须提起各位先生、各位同志和全国人民的注意。中苏友好协会总会准备自十一月七日至十二月六日举行“中苏友好月”，来庆祝伟大的苏联十月社会主义革命的三十五周年，来增强中苏两国人民的友好互助，以促进我们的国家建设，巩固远东和世界的和平。这一活动转瞬就要开始了，苏联著名的文化、科学、艺术工作者的代表团和歌舞团已经来到北京。这在我们是又一次的大规模的国际主义的学习运动。我们全中国人民应该集中力量来把这一项新的任务做好。
    我们在这里要向全国人民建议：全国的各个生产单位、学习单位、工作单位，请都在最近期内，利用生产、学习和工作的空余时间，举行小型的集会，把亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的成就和“中苏友好月”的宣传工作结合起来，作广泛的传达，讨论实行和平会议各项决议的办法，并同时讨论十二月世界人民和平大会的意义。务必要使得全国人民都能够知道团结国际友人的重要性，尤其要知道中苏两国人民的团结便是世界和平的坚强的保障。
    请允许我把毛主席三年前在人民政协开幕时的指示再说一遍吧：
    “只要我们坚持人民民主专政和团结国际友人，我们就会是永远胜利的。”（新华社）
