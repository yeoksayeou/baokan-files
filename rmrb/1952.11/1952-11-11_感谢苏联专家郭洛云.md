    Thanks to Soviet Expert Guo Luoyun
    Comrade Editor: I am the Personnel Section Chief of the Mudanjiang Third Sub-bureau of the Chinese Changchun Railway. In 1950, when the Chinese Changchun Railway was established, the first task was to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet railway in "compiling the sub-bureau staffing table" to compile our sub-bureau's staffing table. After our initial research, we believed that the sub-bureau's various sections needed 370 staff members to complete the tasks; otherwise, the work would not be guaranteed. Later, we discussed this with Soviet expert Comrade Guo Luoyun, and he said that 173 people would be enough. At that time, I lacked confidence, and Comrade Guo Luoyun patiently said to me: "We must be responsible to the country when allocating personnel and not waste a single unit of labor; we must calculate labor based on the needs of the work." Then, he explained in detail the specific tasks of each section and the work that each person should do. At this time, I felt more confident and increased my confidence in the new staffing. So, I discussed the job titles and work of all personnel with the leading comrades of each section, and they agreed that the new staffing was reasonable. As a result, we reduced the number of personnel by 193 compared to our original plan, and these people could be transferred to other jobs.
    In this specific example, I received a great education and further realized the selfless help of Soviet experts to us. Today, as we celebrate the great October Revolution Day, I once again express my heartfelt gratitude to Comrade Guo Luoyun.    Qi Shouchun

    感谢苏联专家郭洛云
    编辑同志：我是中长铁路牡丹江三分局的人事科长。一九五○年中长铁路成立时，第一件工作就是要学习苏联铁路上“编制分局定员表”的先进经验，来编制我们分局的定员表。我们初步研究后，认为分局各科需要三百七十名工作人员，才能完成任务，否则工作就没有保证。后来我们和苏联专家郭洛云同志研究，他说用一百七十三人就可以了。当时我的信心很不足，郭洛云同志就耐心地对我说：“我们配备人员要对国家负责，不能浪费一个劳动力，一定要根据工作需要计算劳力。”接着他又详细地把每个科的具体任务和每个人应作的工作解释了一遍。这时我心中就有了底，提高了对新定员的信心。于是我把所有人员的职名、工作，同各科的领导同志共同研究了一次，他们认为新的定员是合理的。结果按照我们原来的计划减少了一百九十三人，这些人就可以转到其它工作岗位上去。
    在这个具体事例中，我受到很大的教育，进一步体会到苏联专家对我们的无私的帮助。在庆祝伟大的十月革命节的今天，我再向郭洛云同志表示衷心感谢。    齐守臣
