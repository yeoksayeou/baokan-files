The basic method of planned operation and management of enterprises is the economic accounting system, which guarantees the implementation of the strictest economy system and the completion and over-completion of the production tasks given by the state with the least amount of funds. From the very beginning, the China Changchun Railway, under the guidance of Soviet experts, absorbed the advanced Soviet experience and developed along the path of the economic accounting system. For more than two years, the China Changchun Railway has implemented the economic accounting system, not only successfully completing the transportation tasks and improving labor productivity, but also reducing costs and increasing profits. In 1951, the labor productivity of the China Changchun Railway increased by 27.8 percent compared with 1950, and the labor productivity in the first quarter of 1952 increased by 2.9 percent compared with the same quarter of 1951. In 1950, the transportation cost per ton-kilometer was reduced by 8.7 percent compared with the plan, and in 1951, the transportation cost was reduced by 18.5 percent compared with the plan. The China Changchun Railway over-fulfilled the profit plan in both 1950 and 1951, and in the first eight months of 1952, the profit plan was completed by 131.5 percent.

In railway enterprises, the implementation of the economic accounting system can also effectively accelerate capital turnover, release a large amount of capital, and expand the production and reproduction of railway enterprises. In 1951, the capital turnover rate of the China Changchun Railway increased by 2.56 times compared with 1950; in the first quarter of 1952, it increased by 0.1 times compared with the same quarter of 1951, and in the second quarter of 1952, it increased by 0.6 times compared with the second quarter of 1951.

The achievements of the China Changchun Railway in implementing the economic accounting system are due to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the strong assistance of relevant departments, especially due to the personal guidance of Soviet experts and the unremitting study of the advanced experience of Soviet railways by the broad masses of employees and workers, and the extensive development of patriotic competitions.

Under the personal guidance of Soviet experts, the China Changchun Railway has taken many important measures to establish, consolidate and develop the economic accounting system. The first is to compile the production and financial plan of the China Changchun Railway. This plan includes the following items: (1) passenger and freight transportation plan; (2) locomotive and vehicle work and operation plan; (3) calculation of labor force requirements, wage fund and labor productivity plan; (4) business expenditure plan; (5) passenger and freight revenue and other railway affiliated production enterprise revenue plan; (6) major repair work plan; (7) basic construction plan; (8) material supply plan; (9) financial plan.

The compilation of the production and financial plan on the railway is a major event in the implementation of the economic accounting system. It is a "decree" that we must execute, a program of action, a goal of struggle, and a basis for carrying out patriotic labor competitions throughout the railway.

The second measure is to thoroughly improve accounting work. Because accounting accounting, in the process of the enterprise executing the production plan, supervises the status of operating assets and its dynamics, supervises the execution of the enterprise's production plan, financial plan and cost reduction plan. Therefore, doing a good job in accounting accounting is an extremely important task. Accounting accounting should be timely. When supervising the execution of the plan, it should provide some necessary information in a timely manner. Accounting accounting should also be correct. The correctness of the accounting can ensure that the production and financial situation of the whole and individual departments can be truly reflected. Accounting accounting should also be simple and clear. In this way, it can be easily understood by the broad masses of working people and it is easy to absorb the working masses to supervise the results of the enterprise's economic activities.

In order to complete the major task of accounting accounting, it is necessary to vigorously improve accounting work. Since its establishment in May 1950, the China Changchun Railway began to improve accounting work, formulate and promulgate a unified accounting system for the entire railway, and gradually unify various table report formats on this basis; according to the complexity of the work of each business unit and the distance from the bureau, clearly stipulate the date for submitting the final accounts; implement the final account review system, and establish and improve the guidance system (that is, according to the inspection results, the shortcomings and improvement methods are announced to all units of the railway).

While improving accounting work, we also train and cultivate personnel related to accounting work (planning, calculating personnel, etc.). This ensures the reform of the accounting system and the improvement of accounting accounting, thus promoting the implementation of the economic accounting system.

The third measure is to strengthen and improve financial work. For more than two years, with the direct help of Soviet experts, we have more accurately investigated and determined the standard of our own working capital, and appropriately allocated the material conditions of each production unit. What needs to be particularly emphasized here is that, according to the provisions of the economic accounting regulations, the system of settlement and allocation of funds is implemented for each production unit according to the planned unit price of the completed workload. This settlement and allocation system greatly promotes the struggle of each production unit to strive to over-fulfill the task in order to obtain more income. This is an advanced system that plays the role of an economic lever.

The fourth measure is to conduct a wide-ranging and comprehensive four property registrations. We successively registered various materials, spare parts, tools, and working capital stored and hidden in 178 business units, eliminating the so-called "off-book items" and achieving "knowing the numbers in our hearts." After the property inventory, we created a good foundation for correctly compiling the final accounts and formulating capital standards. We also gradually overcame the localist thinking that started from the interests of small units.

The fifth measure is to reform the wage system. Our wage policy is basically to adopt the principle of pay according to work and eliminate egalitarianism, and to implement piecework as much as possible and reduce time-based work. A reasonable wage system is a powerful condition for stimulating the improvement of labor productivity and the development of production. In the work of implementing the piecework system, the primary issue is the investigation and determination of advanced technical norms. This requires comprehensive consideration of the following factors: the development of production technology, the growth of labor machinery and equipment, the improvement of workers' cultural and technical levels, the full utilization of working hours, the improvement of the production process, and the utilization of advanced work experience. We have done a lot of work in these areas.

In addition, it should also be pointed out that the China Changchun Railway has been promoting the economic accounting system in a step-by-step manner for more than two years. In 1950, the economic accounting system was implemented by the bureau and affiliated enterprises such as locomotive, vehicle, factory, forestry, and coal industries. The sub-bureaus and their affiliated sections were unable to implement it due to immature conditions, and only made some preparations, such as gradually changing the units to independent accounting units and equipping them with personnel. This means that the eight months of 1950 was a stage in which a part of the economic accounting was implemented and a part was actively preparing to implement the economic accounting. In 1951, we entered the second stage (the stage of widespread promotion). In the first, second and third quarters, 63 units, including five sub-bureaus, fifteen locomotive main sections, thirteen vehicle sections, and twelve telecommunications sections, were changed from independent accounting units to fully economic accounting system units. 1952 is the third stage, which is the stage of consolidating the economic accounting system. The main task of this stage is to consolidate the achievements already made on the original basis, such as further ensuring the accuracy of planning work, strictly implementing and consciously abiding by financial discipline and labor discipline, and better mastering and promoting advanced experience and methods, and raising the patriotic labor competition to a new and higher stage.

Experience has proved that the promotion of the economic accounting system is a complex and multifaceted task. Our Chinese comrades working in the China Changchun Railway must more carefully appreciate the guidance of Soviet experts, conscientiously study the economic accounting system, and learn well from every link from the principle direction to the specific measures.

    有计划的经营和管理企业的基本方法—经济核算制
    ——中国长春铁路先进经验介绍之四
    中国长春铁路管理局财务处处长  沈东
    经济核算制，是有计划的经营和管理企业的基本方法，它保证实行最严格的节约制度，用最少的资金完成和超额完成国家所给予的生产任务。中长铁路一开始，就在苏联专家的指导下吸取了苏联先进经验，沿着经济核算制的道路，向前发展着。两年多来，中长铁路实行经济核算制度，不仅胜利地完成了运输任务，提高了劳动生产率，而且降低了成本，提高了利润。中长铁路一九五一年的劳动生产率，比一九五○年提高了百分之二十七点八，一九五二年第一季度的劳动生产率比一九五一年同季提高百分之二点九。一九五○年每吨公里的运输成本比计划降低百分之八点七，一九五一年的运输成本则比计划降低百分之十八点五。中长铁路在一九五○年和一九五一年均超额完成了利润计划，而在一九五二年的八个月内，利润计划完成了百分之一百三十一点五。
    在铁路企业中，实行经济核算制，还能有效地加速资金周转，解放出大批的资金，扩大铁路企业的生产和再生产。中长铁路一九五一年资金周转率比
    一九五○年提高二点五六次；一九五二年第一季度比一九五一年同季度提高零点一次，一九五二年第二季度较一九五一年第二季度提高零点六次。
    中长铁路实行经济核算制的成就，是由于中国共产党的正确领导和有关部门的有力协助，尤其是由于苏联专家的亲手指导和广大职工群众坚持不懈地学习了苏联铁路的先进经验，开展了广泛的爱国主义竞赛。
    在苏联专家的亲自指导下，中长铁路曾采取了许多重要措施，来建立、巩固和发展经济核算制。首先就是编制了中长铁路的生产财务计划。这一计划包括下列各项：（1）客运货运运输计划；（2）机车、车辆工作及运用计划；（3）劳动力需要量、工资基金的计算和劳动生产效率计划；（4）营业支出计划；（5）客运货运收入及其他铁路附属生产企业收入计划；（6）大修工作计划；（7）基本建设计划；（8）材料供应计划；（9）财务计划。
    铁路上生产财务计划的编制，是实行经济核算制的一件大事，是我们必须执行的“法令”，是全路行动的纲领、奋斗的目标和开展爱国主义劳动竞赛
    的依据。
    第二个措施是彻底地改进了会计工作。因为会计核算，在企业执行生产计划底过程中，监督着经营资产的状况和它的动态，监督着企业生产计划、财务计划和成本减低计划的执行。因此做好会计核算，是一个极其重大的工作。会计核算应当是及时的。在监督计划执行时，应及时地提供一些必需的情报。会计核算也应当是正确的。核算的正确性，可保证全部及个别部门的生产情况和财务情况能够真实地反映出来。会计核算还应当是简明而清晰的。这样，就能使它易为广大劳动人民所了解，并容易吸收劳动群众来监督企业经济活动的成果。
    为了完成会计核算的重大任务，必须大力地改进会计工作。中长铁路自一九五○年五月成立起，就开始改进会计工作，制定并颁布了全路统一的会计制度，并逐渐在这一基础上，统一规定各种表报格式；根据各业务单位工作的繁简和距管理局的远近，明确规定提报决算日期；实行决算审查制，以及建立与健全指导制度（这就是根据检查结果，将缺点和改进办法向全路各单位公布）。
    在改进会计工作的同时，还训练与培养会计工作有关的人员（计划、计算员等）。这就保证了会计制度的改革和会计核算的改进，因而促进了经济核算制的实行。
    第三个措施是加强了和健全了财务工作。两年多来，经过了苏联专家的直接帮助，我们比较准确地查定了自有流动资金标准，适当地配置了各生产单位的物质条件。这里要特别着重提出的，就是根据经济核算条例的规定，按完成的工作量的计划单价，对各生产单位实行清算拨款制度。这种清算拨款制度，大大地促使各生产单位为争取超额完成任务，以获得较多的收入而奋斗。这是一种先进的起着经济杠杆作用的制度。
    第四个措施是进行了广泛的、全面的四次财产登记。先后登记了存和藏在一百七十八个业务单位的各种材料、备品工具、流动资金，消除了所谓“帐外品”，做到了“心中有数”。进行了财产清查后，就给正确的编造决算和制定资金标准，创设了良好的基础。也逐渐克服了那种从小单位利益出发的本位主义思想。
    第五个措施是改革工资制度。我们的工资政策，基本上是采取按劳取酬、消灭平均主义的原则，尽可能地实行计件制，减少计时制。合理的工资制度，是刺激提高劳动生产率，发展生产的有力条件。在实行计件制的工作中，首要的问题就是先进的技术定额的查定。这需要全面考虑下面的各项因素：生产技术的发展，劳动机械装备的增长，工人文化水平和技术水平的提高，工作时间的充分利用，生产过程的改进以及先进工作经验的利用等。我们曾在这些方面作了不少工作。
    此外还应当提出的，就是中长铁路两年多来推行经济核算制是有步骤地进行的。一九五○年实行经济核算制的，是管理局和机车、车辆、工厂、林业、煤业等附属企业。分局及其附属段由于条件未成熟，未能实行，只作了一些准备工作，如把各单位逐渐改为独立会计单位，并配备人员等。这就是说一九五○年八个月是一部分实行经济核算、一部分积极准备实行经济核算的阶段。一九五一年进入第二阶段（广泛推行的阶段），一、二、三季度，把五个分局，十五个机务本段，十三个车辆段和十二个电务段等六十三个单位，从独立会计单位，改为完全经济核算制单位。一九五二年为第三阶段，这是巩固经济核算制的阶段。这一阶段主要任务是在原有的基础上，巩固已得的成绩，例如进一步做到计划工作的准确性，严格地执行与自觉地遵守财务纪律与劳动纪律，以及更好地掌握与推广先进的经验与方法，把爱国主义劳动竞赛，提高到新的更高阶段等。
    经验证明：经济核算制的推行，是一件复杂的多方面的工作。我们在中长铁路工作的中国同志，必须更细心地体会苏联专家的指导，认真钻研经济核算制，从原则方向到具体措施的每一关节，都要很好地学习。
