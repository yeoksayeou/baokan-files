    Hygiene Model Train on the Hangzhou-Nanjing Line
    Jiali
    Every morning, the first express trains depart from Hangzhou and Nanjing stations towards each other. Those in charge of these two trains are the Hangzhou-Nanjing package crew of the Hangzhou Train Section. Thanks to the efforts of all the comrades in the group, the inside and outside of the train remain clean and tidy from the departure station to the destination station.
    When the station begins the first ticket check to allow passengers to enter, the train attendants line up neatly at the ticket gate to welcome guests. They guide passengers to their respective carriages and help them find seats and arrange their luggage, so that passengers feel a sense of warmth and familiarity as soon as they enter the carriage, just like being at home.
    Achieving this is not easy. It requires all crew members to "serve the people wholeheartedly." Ni Shoudao, who adopted the new working method mentioned above, is precisely a worker with this noble quality. Since the Hangzhou-Nanjing package crew implemented the "passenger welcoming method" and the "three places to put and one thing not to hang" system (large items are placed under the seats, small items are placed on the racks, ensuring they are placed flat and stable; clothing hooks are used for hats and coats, and no other items are hung), it has not only changed the past overcrowding phenomenon but also shortened the time it takes for passengers to board the train. Passengers praised, saying: "We don't have to worry about traveling anymore." Because the number of passengers in each car is close to the average, it is very convenient for the crew to check and take care of sick passengers. If a patient with an infectious disease is found, they can be quickly sent to the "hygiene car" for isolation and medical treatment.
    Before the train departs, the crew first checks the cleanliness of all carriages. If they find any place is not clean, they use the time before "letting passengers in" (ticket check to allow passengers to enter) to mobilize all the train staff to clean. After the passengers are seated and the train starts moving, the cleaning work also begins, divided into two parts, front and rear, centered on the dining car. For example, the Chen Lun team of the Lü Enyao train shift is responsible for cleaning the front half of the train. They wipe the washbasins, entrance and exit signs, copper rods, and coffee tables until they are sparkling clean, and ensure that the water in the spittoons is always clean. The Zhang Hanyun team, which is responsible for cleaning the rear half of the train, is not lagging behind either. They put forward the slogan: "Wipe the handrails at every station, so that dust does not touch the passengers' hands!" When arriving at large stations, because the stopover time is longer, the crew gets off the train to wipe the window sills and walls outside the carriages. Every time they run a trip, they squeeze out time to wash the outside of the train once. After the train leaves the station, the crew regularly washes the spittoons, sprinkles carbolic acid, sweeps the floor, wipes off stains, and cleans the toilets, etc. In order to remove the garbage from the gaps in the heating pipes, the crew adopted a two-person cleaning method before the train arrived at the terminal station: one person held a hook to take out the garbage from the gaps, and the other person held a broom to sweep along, so that the inside and outside of the carriage were always kept clean.
    The management of the catering industry on the Hangzhou-Nanjing line is extremely strict. All dining car staff wear white work clothes and masks. They regularly trim their nails and make sure to wash their hands before cooking and do not touch miscellaneous items while cooking; all eating utensils are washed with hot water. The teacups for passengers are disinfected before use.
    Mobilizing passengers to keep the inside of the train clean is a major feature of the work of the Hangzhou-Nanjing package crew. Train captain Lü Enyao, referring to the experience of the Northeast Railway Bureau, established a "passenger representative system." The implementation of this system has ensured the hygiene and driving safety inside the train. "Passenger representatives" are elected by the passengers. The conditions are: first, they must be long-distance passengers; second, they cannot be too old or disabled. Most of the representatives elected each time are workers, revolutionary soldiers, public servants, teachers and students who can represent the opinions of passengers. After they are elected as representatives, the crew invites them to sit in the passenger representative seat with a small red flag inserted in it. At this time, the representatives begin to perform their duties—assisting the crew in maintaining the safety and cleanliness inside the train. Once, a young couple was elected as passenger representatives. The woman challenged her husband: "We guarantee that our carriage will: not let the baby defecate or urinate indiscriminately; put down all the screens; adults will not smoke in the carriage. What are you going to do in your carriage?" After receiving the challenge, the husband immediately took action, going from seat to seat to persuade passengers to keep the carriage clean. On September 16th, a passenger on the Hangzhou-Nanjing line was elected as a representative. At every stop, he helped older guests get on and off the train. An international friend took this train, and saw that the train was clean and orderly, and the passengers were humble and polite. He said to people: "I am very satisfied with the organization on the train. It is very enviable that China can do this in such a short period of time after liberation."
    Before the train arrives at the terminal station, the train captain invites all the passenger representatives to hold a meeting to listen to the passengers' opinions on the train's hygiene work, and promptly reports these opinions to the train shift. This not only makes the relationship between passengers and train staff closer but also improves and refines the train work.

    杭宁线上的卫生模范列车
    加里
    每天清晨，杭州和南京车站对开第一列特别快车；包乘这两趟客车的，是杭州列车段杭宁包乘组。由于全组同志的努力，从出发站到终点站，车内外始终保持整洁。
    当车站上开始第一次检票让旅客进站的时候，列车员们便整队排列在检票处，迎接客人。他们引导旅客到各自负责的车厢里，并帮助他们找座位、安置行李什物，使旅客一进车厢，就感到亲切、温暖，像在自己家里一样。
    要做到这一点并不是容易的。这需要全体乘务人员“全心全意为人民服务”。而采取上述新工作方法的倪守道，正是具有这种高尚品质的工人。杭宁包乘组自实行“接引旅客上车法”和“三放一不挂”的制度（大件放在座下，小件放在架上，保证放平放稳；衣钩挂衣帽，一律不挂其它什物）以后，不仅改变了过去的拥挤现象，而且缩短了旅客上车的时间。旅客们称赞着说：以后出门再也不用操心了。由于各车旅客的人数接近平均，乘务员极便于检查、照顾有病的旅客，如果发现传染病患者，就可以迅速地把他送到“卫生车”上，进行隔离、医疗。
    列车出发前，乘务员首先检查所有车厢的整洁情况，如果发现那里不清洁，便利用“放客”（检票让旅客进站）前一段时间，发动全车工作人员，进行清扫。乘客入座后，列车开始行进了，清扫工作也随着开始，以餐车为中心，分为前后两部分别进行。譬如说，吕恩耀车班的陈仑大组，负责清扫列车的前半部，他们把面盆、出入口牌、铜杆、茶几，擦得晶亮；并使痰盂里的水经常保持清洁。清扫后半部的章汉云组也并不落后，他们提出了“站站
    （车站）抹扶手，灰尘不沾旅客手！”的口号。到了大站，因为停留时间较长，乘务员便下车揩抹车厢外部的窗沿和车壁。每跑一趟车，他们都要挤出时间把列车外部冲洗一次。列车离站以后，乘务员经常冲洗痰盂，洒石炭酸，擦扫地板，揩抹污渍，清理厕所等。为了清除暖气管缝隙里的垃圾，乘务员在列车到达终点站以前，采用了两人清扫法：一人执钩掏出缝里的垃圾，一人持扫帚随着清扫，这样就使车厢内外经常保持了清洁。
    杭宁线上对饮食业的管理极为严格。餐车工作人员一律着白色工作服，带口罩。他们经常修剪指甲，并且做到做饭前将手洗净，做饭时不乱摸杂物；饮食用具一律用热水洗净。供旅客用的茶杯，用前都要经过消毒。
    发动旅客保持车内清洁，是杭宁包乘组工作中的主要特点。车长吕恩耀参照东北路局的经验，建立了“旅客代表制”。这一制度的实行，使车内卫生、行车安全得到了保障。“旅客代表”是由旅客推选出来的，条件是：第一，必须是长途乘客；第二，年纪不能太大或是有残疾的人。每次被推选出的代表，大多是能代表旅客意见的工人、革命军人、公教人员和青年学生。他们当选代表后，乘务员便请他们坐在插有小红旗的旅客代表席上。这时，代表们便开始执行任务——协助乘务人员维护车内的安全和整洁。有一次，一对青年夫妇被选为旅客代表。女的向丈夫挑战：“我们车上保证做到：宝宝不乱拉屎尿；纱窗全部放下；大人不在车上抽烟，你们车上准备怎样做呢？”丈夫接到挑战书后，马上行动起来，逐座向乘客进行劝说，要求他们保持车内清洁。九月十六日，杭宁线上有一位旅客被选为代表，每到一站，他便帮助年纪大的客人上车、下车。有一位国际友人坐了这趟车，看见车上既整洁，又有秩序，乘客都很谦让而且有礼貌，他对人说：“我对于车上的组织，非常满意。在中国解放以后短短的时间内能够如此，使人非常羡慕。”
    在列车到达终点站以前，车长邀请全车旅客代表举行会议，听取旅客们对列车卫生工作的意见，并将这些意见及时反映到车班。这样不仅使旅客和列车工作人员的关系更为密切，而且提高和改进了列车工作。
