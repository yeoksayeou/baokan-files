    The South China Materials Exchange Conference opened in Guangzhou on the 17th. Participating in the conference were more than 5,000 industrial and commercial representatives from all major administrative regions, major cities, and various parts of Guangdong and Guangxi, as well as industrial and commercial representatives from Hong Kong, Macau, and other places. This autumn, various crops in South China have had bumper harvests, and now is the time when South China's native and special products are being marketed in large quantities. Therefore, the task of the conference is to do a good job in the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. This conference was held after intermediate and primary market materials exchange meetings were successively held in various parts of Guangdong Province; the holding of these primary market materials exchange meetings has prepared successful conditions for the conference.

    Sichuan Yibin 602 Factory Successfully Experiments with Sugarcane渣 Papermaking

    Workers at the State-owned 602 Paper Mill in Yibin County, Sichuan, under the guidance and assistance of Soviet expert V. Vilegzhanin, have successfully experimented with papermaking using sugarcane bagasse. According to experiments conducted from October 16th to 20th, using 100% sugarcane bagasse to produce coarse pulp, the highest yield reached over 85%, the alkali consumption was very small, and the paper produced was very strong. It is estimated that this kind of pulp made from sugarcane bagasse can be used to manufacture high-grade cultural paper, or industrial and commercial paper, special paper, etc. Because sugarcane bagasse contains moisture and residual sugar, which is prone to fermentation and inconvenient for long-distance transportation, Soviet expert V. Vilegzhanin also suggested using the existing centrifuges and other equipment in sugar factories to directly manufacture sugarcane bagasse semi-pulp in the sugar factory. This can also increase profits and improve the utilization rate of sugar factory machines for the sugar factory itself.

    四川宜宾六零二厂试用甘蔗渣造纸成功
    四川宜宾县国营六零二纸厂职工在苏联专家威烈基金的指导和帮助下，试用甘蔗渣造纸获得成功。根据十月十六日到二十日的实验，用百分之百的蔗渣制造粗浆，收获率最高达到百分之八十五以上，碱液消耗量很小，造出的纸张韧性很强。估计这种用蔗渣制造的纸浆，将来可用以制造高级文化用纸，或工商用纸、特种纸等。由于甘蔗渣含有水分和残余糖分，容易发酵，不便长途运输。苏联专家威烈基金又建议利用糖厂现有离心机等设备，在糖厂直接制造蔗渣半料浆，这对糖厂本身来说，也可以提高利润和提高糖厂机器利用率。
