    French Colonialists Persecute the People of Morocco and Tunisia
    The atrocities of French colonialists persecuting patriotic people in Morocco and Tunisia in North Africa are endless. On the evening of November 13, the working-class district of Casablanca, Morocco, was searched by French troops, and many Moroccan workers were arrested.
    The French military court in Tunisia sentenced eight Tunisian patriotic fighters to varying terms of imprisonment for participating in the struggle against colonial oppression. In addition, eight citizens were also sentenced to imprisonment for participating in a demonstration.
    U.S. Ambassador to Greece Manipulates Greek Elections
    Greece held a general election on November 16. Former commander-in-chief of the Greek royalist fascist army, and the fascist Bebergos, long favored by U.S. imperialism, succeeded Plastiras as Prime Minister and concurrently Minister of Defense. The new government took office on the 19th. The Greek election was held under the direct instructions and control of the U.S. Ambassador to Greece, Mr. Peurifoy. The U.S. Embassy designated the election date, formulated an anti-democratic electoral system, and decided on the list of candidates for the Greek bourgeois parties. This open and arbitrary interference by the United States in Greek internal affairs, even the "Alaghi Report," which is close to Greek government officials, considers it an "unprecedented and intolerable phenomenon." On the other hand, candidates and campaign activities of the Greek Left Democratic Alliance have been subjected to various persecutions. Despite this, many voters disregarded everything and voted for the Left Democratic Alliance. According to the announced results, the Left Democratic Alliance received more than 160,000 votes, accounting for 10 percent of the total votes.
    U.S. Imperialists Build New Air Force Bases in Thailand
    A special correspondent for the Indian weekly "Delhi Times" reported: According to reliable sources, the United States and Thailand signed an agreement in mid-August 1952, stipulating that Thailand grant the United States the right to build new air force bases on Thai territory. At the beginning of 1951, the construction of airports in Chonburi, Prachuap Khiri Khan, Surat Thani, Phitsanulok and other areas had already begun. The most recent agreement is to build new modern military airports in the areas of Chiang Mai, Nakhon Ratchasima, Songkhla and Chanthaburi.
    The Luan Phibunsongkhram government of Thailand accepted "U.S. aid," and at the same time sold out the country's independence, and put Thailand in a painful and dangerous situation.
    U.S. Government Persecutes United Nations Secretariat Staff
    The U.S. government is intensifying its fascist persecution of United Nations Secretariat staff. The Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, led by reactionary U.S. fascist James Eastland, began on October 13 to summon U.S. staff members of the United Nations Secretariat in batches to "investigate" whether they were "loyal" to the U.S. ruling clique. Filer, the director of the Legal Department of the United Nations Secretariat, who was summoned by the Eastland Committee, committed suicide by jumping off a building on November 13 under the stimulation of this atmosphere of terror.
    The Eastland Committee's brazen interference in United Nations affairs has undermined the agreement between the U.S. government and the United Nations, and has aroused the indignation of representatives of many countries attending the United Nations and staff members of the United Nations Secretariat.
    Some bourgeois newspapers in Western European countries have also criticized the U.S.'s arbitrary treatment of the United Nations. A "Daily Mirror" reporter in New York believes that the United States must be reminded that "the United Nations is an organization of sixty countries, not just the United States alone." The editor of the Danish "Information," Seidenfaden, advocated moving the permanent site of the United Nations away from the United States, believing that it is too easily influenced by the United States there.

    国际简讯
    法国殖民者迫害摩洛哥和突尼斯人民
    法国殖民者在北非摩洛哥和突尼斯迫害爱国人民的暴行层出不穷。十一月十三日晚上，摩洛哥卡萨布兰卡的工人区受到法国军队的搜查，很多摩洛哥籍的工人遭逮捕。
    突尼斯的法国军事法庭判处八个突尼斯爱国志士刑期长短不一的徒刑，因为他们参加了反对殖民压迫的斗争。另外八个公民因为参加了一个示威运动，也被宣判徒刑。
    美国驻希腊大使操纵希腊选举
    希腊在十一月十六日举行了大选。前希腊保皇法西斯军总司令、美帝国主义属意已久的法西斯分子贝贝格斯继普拉斯蒂拉斯任首相并兼国防大臣。新政府已在十九日上台。希腊这次大选是在美国驻希腊大使普利孚的直接指示和控制下举行的。美国大使馆指定了选举日期，制订了反民主的选举制度，而且决定了希腊各资产阶级政党的候选人名单。美国对于希腊内政这种公开和横暴的干涉，甚至连接近希腊政府人士的“阿拉吉报”也认为是一种“前所未有的不能忍受的现象”。另一方面，希腊左翼民主联盟的候选人和竞选活动曾遭到各种迫害。尽管如此，许多选民仍不顾一切而投了左翼民主联盟的票。据宣布的结果，左翼民主联盟共得十六万多票，占总票数百分之十。
    美帝国主义者在泰国修筑新空军基地
    印度的“德里时代”周刊的特派记者报道：据可靠人士的消息，美国与泰国在一九五二年八月中旬签订了一项协定，规定泰国给予美国以在泰国领土上建立新空军基地的权利。一九五一年年初，春武里、巴蜀、素叻他尼、彭世洛及其他地区的机场的建筑工程已经开始。最近的这一协定是决定在清迈、呵叻、宋卡和尖竹汶地区建筑新的现代化的军事机场的。
    泰国的銮披汶政府接受了“美援”，同时也就出卖了国家的独立，并使泰国处于一种痛苦的也是危险的境地中。
    美国政府迫害联合国秘书处工作人员
    美国政府正在加紧用法西斯手段迫害联合国秘书处工作人员。反动的美国法西斯分子麦卡伦领导的参议院国内安全小组委员会又于十月十三日开始分批传讯联合国秘书处的美籍工作人员，“调查”他们对美国统治集团是否“忠诚”。受到麦卡伦委员会传讯的联合国秘书处法律部主任菲勒尔，在这种恐怖气氛的刺激下，于十一月十三日跳楼自杀。
    麦卡伦委员会对联合国事务的无耻干涉，破坏了美国政府与联合国缔结的协定，已引起了出席联合国的许多国家的代表及联合国秘书处工作人员的愤慨。
    西欧国家一些资产阶级报纸也抨击美国这种对待联合国的专横手段。英国“每日镜报”驻纽约记者认为必须提起美国注意：“联合国是六十个国家的组织，而不只是美国一个国家的组织”。丹麦“新闻报”编辑赛登法登主张把联合国的永久会址搬离美国，他认为在美国太容易受到美国的影响了。
