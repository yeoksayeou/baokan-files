Xinhua News Agency Report: The United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee held meetings on November 3, 5, and 7 to continue discussing the Korean issue. The speeches of representatives from the U.S.-British bloc countries at the meetings once again proved that the United States and its allies in the Korean War are opposed to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and advocate continuing aggression against Korea and the Chinese people. As before, representatives from the U.S.-British bloc countries used various tricks to defend the shameless and barbaric behavior of the United Nations Command in persecuting prisoners of war in Korea. They attempted to force the committee to accept the notorious U.S. proposal on Korea, thereby eliminating the possibility of reaching a consensus resolution to end the war.

    However, despite the great pressure exerted by the U.S. delegation, it was only able to get twenty delegations to sign its proposal. In this regard, American newspapers pointed out that representatives from certain Asian and Latin American countries were unwilling to support the U.S. proposal. The speeches of representatives from the U.S.-British bloc at the meetings showed that the United States had decided to intensify the pressure to get the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly to support its war of aggression in Korea.

    Speaking at the meeting on the 3rd were the representatives of Canada, Turkey, and Peru.

    Canadian representative Martin, when discussing the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war, dragged in the irrelevant issue of the right to asylum for political exiles. But everyone knows that the crux of the Korean issue is not granting "asylum" to certain political exiles, but guaranteeing the right of prisoners of war to return home, a right guaranteed by the 1949 Geneva Convention.

    The next speaker was Turkish representative Sarper, who delivered a long series of clichés, repeating Acheson's words and British representative Lloyd's words.

    The U.S. position on the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war was also supported by Peruvian representative Belaunde. This Peruvian representative suggested establishing a United Nations Committee for the Repatriation of Prisoners of War. It is not difficult to imagine that, according to Belaunde's view, such a committee would inevitably use the name of the United Nations to cover up the criminal behavior of the U.S. military headquarters in Korea in persecuting prisoners of war.

    Syngman Rhee's representative, permitted by the U.S.-British bloc to attend the Political Committee, did not mention a single word about a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue in his shameless speech, nor did he mention that the South Korean rulers wanted to end the Korean War. On the contrary, this U.S. lackey clamored for continuing the war until "victory." He said that as long as an inch of North Korean territory remained in the hands of the Communists, they would unify Korea.

    When referring to the aggressive statements made by Syngman Rhee and his running dogs on the eve of the attack on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, this Syngman Rhee's representative shamelessly admitted that this was a fact, admitting that they initially intended to take all means, including war, to restore the already "lost national heritage."

    The South Korean representative begged his master for help to continue maintaining the slaughterhouse in Korea. He frankly said that if the relatives of South Korean soldiers were starving in the rear, it would be impossible to drive these soldiers to the front lines to fight.

    Speaking at the meeting on the 5th were the representatives of the Philippines, Uruguay, the Dominican Republic, Brazil, Lebanon, and Czechoslovakia.

    The Philippine representative openly said that any suggestion for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue should not be discussed by the committee if it condemned U.S. intervention, or—as he put it—caused people to "doubt the actions of the American forces in Korea."

    The Philippine representative dared not deny the facts cited by the head of the Soviet delegation regarding the use of violence and terror by the U.S. military headquarters during the so-called "screening" of prisoners of war. He supported the "re-screening" of prisoners of war and stated that he believed that the role of the Political Committee and the United Nations General Assembly in discussing the Korean issue should be reduced to merely passing a resolution on this issue.

    One of the proponents of the U.S. proposal, Uruguayan representative Charlone, fully supported the U.S. proposal and the U.S. military headquarters' attitude on the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war. Dominican Republic representative Franco also obsequiously said that he "unconditionally supported" the U.S. proposal on the Korean issue.

    The Lebanese and Brazilian representatives also supported the U.S. proposal.

    The head of the Czechoslovak delegation, Mrs. Sekaninová, delivered a powerful speech, citing concrete facts to expose the attempt of the U.S.-British bloc representatives to cover up U.S. aggression in Korea under the banner of the United Nations, and pointed out that the United States was making every effort to use the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war to obstruct a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    Speaking at the meeting on the 7th were the representatives of Nicaragua, Abyssinia, Egypt, Yugoslavia, and Ukraine.

    The representatives of Nicaragua and Abyssinia merely repeated the speeches of other supporters of the U.S. policy of aggression in Korea to the committee.

    The representative of the Tito gang of Yugoslavia also supported U.S. aggression in Korea. In order to please his master, he shamelessly slandered the Soviet Union, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the People's Republic of China, and obsequiously praised the U.S. proposal.

    The Egyptian representative admitted that the so-called "voluntary repatriation" of prisoners of war, supported by the United States and some other delegations, would actually lead to "forced detention of prisoners of war." He emphasized that the committee should always remember when dealing with the Korean issue that people are dying in Korea while the United Nations is arguing; the committee has a task to stop the Korean War, find a good way to solve the Korean issue, and not be "enthusiastic about drafting resolutions."

    The Egyptian representative said that when the United Nations discusses the Korean issue, it should propose guarantees against "forced detention or forced interrogation of prisoners of war." But he immediately added that it is also necessary to guarantee against "forced repatriation" of prisoners of war.

    The head of the Ukrainian delegation, Mr. Baranovsky, pointed out in his speech that the United States and those countries that are helping the United States to aggress against Korea are unwilling to seek a way to peacefully resolve the Korean War, but want to continue the Korean War.

    联大政治委员会继续讨论朝鲜问题
    捷代表等斥美国阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题
    美英集团代表为美国屠杀战俘罪行辩护
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：联合国大会政治委员会在十一月三日、五日和七日举行会议，继续讨论朝鲜问题。美英集团国家代表在会上的发言，再一次证明了美国和它在干涉朝鲜战争中的盟友是反对和平解决朝鲜问题、主张继续侵略朝鲜和中国人民的。像以前一样，美英集团国家的代表使用种种诡计，企图为联合国军司令部在朝鲜迫害战俘的无耻、野蛮行为辩解。他们力图强迫委员会接受臭名远扬的美国关于朝鲜的提案，从而排除达成一致决议结束战争的可能性。
    但是，尽管美国代表团使用了很大的压力，它仍然只能拉到二十个代表团在它的提案上签名。在这方面，美国报纸指出，某些亚洲和拉丁美洲国家的代表都不愿支持美国的提案。美英集团代表在会上的发言说明：美国已决定加紧施用压力，使得联合国第七届大会支持它在朝鲜的侵略战争。
    在三日会上发言的有：加拿大、土耳其和秘鲁代表。
    加拿大代表马丁在谈到遣返战俘问题时，硬扯上不相干的庇护政治流亡者的权利问题。但是大家都知道，朝鲜问题的症结不是给予某种政治流亡者以“庇护”，而在于保障战俘回家的权利，这种权利是一九四九年日内瓦公约所保证的。
    继起发言的是土耳其代表沙贝，他讲了一大套陈词滥调，把艾奇逊的话和英国代表劳埃德的话重复了一遍。
    美国对于遣返战俘问题的立场也得到秘鲁代表碧朗第的支持。这位秘鲁代表建议成立一个联合国遣返战俘委员会，不难想见，根据碧朗第的意见，这样一个委员会势必要用联合国的名义来掩饰美军司令部在朝鲜迫害战俘的罪恶行为。
    被美英集团允许出席政治委员会的李承晚的代表在他的无耻的发言里，一个字也没有提到和平解决朝鲜问题，一个字也没有提到南朝鲜统治者想结束朝鲜战争。相反地，这位美国的衙役却叫嚣把战争继续进行到“胜利”为止。他说，只要北朝鲜有一寸土地在共产党人手里，他们就要统一朝鲜。
    这位李承晚的代表在提到李承晚和他的走狗在进攻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国前夕所发表的侵略言论时，无耻地承认这是事实，承认他们当初打算采取
    一切手段，包括战争在内，来恢复已经“丧失的民族遗产”。
    南朝鲜代表乞求他的主子给予帮助，以继续维持朝鲜的屠场。他坦白地说：如果南朝鲜士兵的亲属在后方挨饿，那就无法驱使这些士兵上前线作战。
    在五日会上发言的有菲律宾、乌拉圭、多米尼加共和国、巴西、黎巴嫩以及捷克斯洛伐克代表。
    菲律宾代表公然说，任何和平解决朝鲜问题的建议如果谴责美国的干涉，或者——如他所说的——使人们对美国军队“在朝鲜的作为发生怀疑”，委员会就不能加以讨论。
    菲律宾代表不敢否认苏联代表团团长举出的关于美军司令部在所谓“甄别”战俘期间使用暴力和恐怖手段的事实。他支持“重新甄别”战俘，并表示他认为政治委员会和联合国大会在讨论朝鲜问题中的作用，应该减少到仅仅在这个问题上通过一项决议。
    美国提案的提案人之一、乌拉圭代表查龙奈完全支持美国提案以及美军司令部在遣返战俘问题上的态度。多米尼加共和国代表弗兰哥也奴颜婢膝地说，他“无条件地支持”美国关于朝鲜问题的提案。
    黎巴嫩和巴西代表也支持美国的提案。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表团团长塞卡尼诺娃发表了一篇有力的演说，举出具体事实揭露美英集团代表企图用联合国的旗帜来掩饰美国在朝鲜的侵略，并指出美国竭力企图利用遣返战俘问题来阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决。
    在七日会上发言的有尼加拉瓜、阿比西尼亚、埃及、南斯拉夫以及乌克兰代表。
    尼加拉瓜和阿比西尼亚的代表只是把美国侵略朝鲜的政策的其它支持者在委员会上的发言重复了一遍。
    南斯拉夫铁托匪帮的代表也支持美国在朝鲜的侵略，为了讨好他的主子，他竟然无耻地诽谤苏联、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国，奴颜婢膝地称颂美国的提案。
    埃及代表承认，美国以及一些其它国家的代表团所支持的所谓“自愿遣返”战俘，实际上只会走向
    “强迫扣留战俘”。他着重指出，委员会在处理朝鲜问题的时候应该始终记住：在联合国进行争吵的时候，人民正在朝鲜死去；委员会有任务来制止朝鲜战争，找出解决朝鲜问题的好办法，不要“热中于起草决议案”。
    埃及代表说，联合国讨论朝鲜问题的时候，应该提出保证，反对“强迫扣留或是强迫询问战俘”。但他马上又说，也有必要保证反对“强迫遣返”战俘。
    乌克兰代表团团长巴拉诺夫斯基在发言中指出，美国以及帮同美国侵略朝鲜的那些国家：不愿意寻求和平解决朝鲜战争的方法，而要继续进行朝鲜战争。
