    A Young Female Mutual Aid Team Leader
    Wu Peihua
    The Cui Yuxia mutual aid team in Wu宅村, Zhao场乡, Yao集区, Su北睢宁县, was rated as a "Model Mutual Aid Team for High Yield of Winter Wheat in Dry Land" by the Central Ministry of Agriculture in 1951. The leader of this mutual aid team, Cui Yuxia, is only twenty years old this year and is a young Communist Party member. She has shown excellent results in various tasks and has won five model and meritorious titles in the county.
    How can a twenty-year-old girl lead a mutual aid team and make it a model mutual aid team? Where does her ability come from? She sincerely said: "I have very little experience. I learn as I go. I know that if I want to do a good job, I must rely closely on the Party and rely on the masses. People must be upright, talk about democracy, consult with the masses on everything, and always plan for the masses."
    In January 1950, the Huaiyin area of northern Jiangsu suffered a flood, and the entire county of Suining became a disaster area. The county held an enlarged cadre meeting, calling on farmers to "organize, produce for disaster relief, and ensure that no one starves to death." Cui Yuxia was then the director of the township women's association and also attended this meeting. With full enthusiasm, she returned to the village and discussed the village's production and disaster relief plan with the village chief. At that time, the village chief was a little hesitant, because ensuring that no one starved to death was not a simple matter. Cui Yuxia thought: I am a Communist Party member, and I should take on this serious task. Encouraged by the township instructor, she helped the village chief to formulate a plan and signed her name first. The plan was taken to the district, and the district chief looked at it and said to Cui Yuxia: "Great! The plan is well formulated, let's implement it immediately!" He also encouraged her and discussed the specific methods with her. At this time, she thought: With the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the task of not starving a single person can definitely be completed.
    There were twenty-one poor peasant households in Wu宅 village, and they were living in great difficulty. Among them, the five most difficult households had men who had already gone to repair the Huai River. Now, facing the famine, the women and children had no food to eat and spent their days huddled in haystacks, living in extreme misery. Cui Yuxia went to each household to ask for some thin porridge and borrowed some carrots to feed these women and children. Then she organized the nine women from these five families into a spinning group. Cui Yuxia took out her own savings of two catties of cotton and gave them to the spinning group as raw materials, and she also took the time to help with spinning. She mobilized the whole village to help each other and carry out various sideline productions. By March, the entire village not only successfully survived the famine but also saved 800 catties of grain to help the victims in their own and other townships.
    Soon, Cui Yuxia received a letter from the workers at the Huai River construction site, thanking her for her support. Before this, the spinning group had written to them telling them about their victory over the disaster at home.
    In March, the county leading organs held an enlarged cadre meeting, and Cui Yuxia was rated as a second-class meritorious person for production and disaster relief. The leading comrades at the meeting called for "timely spring plowing to ensure that no land is left uncultivated." Cui Yuxia immediately guaranteed to complete this task and formulated a plan to challenge other townships.
    After returning to the village, she mobilized the women to carry out spring plowing, turning the spinning group into a plowing group. At that time, the Diverting the Yi River project had already begun, and most of the male laborers in the village had gone to repair the river. The village lacked livestock, and most women had no experience in farming, so plowing and sowing was difficult. She herself was thin and weak, had little strength, and had never done heavy work in the fields. But she did not retreat in the face of difficulties. She found an old farmer, learned to plow the land, and went to help the women's plowing group. On the first day, ten people were so tired that they could not straighten their backs, and they plowed a total of two and a half mu of land, and the plowing was not even. Some women were discouraged; children were crying at home, which further affected their mood. Cui Yuxia was worried and could not eat, thinking about the children's problems. She remembered that her aunt loved children the most. When she was twelve years old, her mother died, and she and her siblings grew up relying on her old aunt. So she went to ask her old aunt to take care of the children for the women who were working in the fields. After running around and persuading her, the problem of taking care of the children was solved. The members of the women's plowing group were able to work in the fields with peace of mind, and their efficiency quickly increased to four mu per day.
    When the wheat ripened, she used the women's plowing group as the foundation and also absorbed some male laborers to form a wheat-cutting group, quickly cutting the wheat. They mobilized the remaining labor to do odd jobs outside, earning 520 catties of wheat. Some people outside the group saw the benefits of working together and asked to join. In the autumn, Cui Yuxia and the others discussed and formally established a year-round mutual aid team and was elected as the leader.
    By the end of the year, Cui Yuxia's mutual aid team had grown to thirteen households, sixty-four people (this year the whole team has grown to fourteen households, sixty-seven people). As the team grew larger, Cui Yuxia became timid. How could she, lacking leadership experience, lead the mutual aid team well? Men and women, old and young, in the team comforted her and said: Yuxia, don't worry, everyone will think of a way if something happens, it will work! Sure enough, Cui Yuxia relied closely on the masses, especially the core members of the team such as Communist Party members and Youth League members, and consulted with everyone on everything, and really made the mutual aid team a success.
    Work evaluation and point calculation was the biggest problem encountered since the establishment of the mutual aid team, and it was also the key to whether the mutual aid team could be successful. In fact, this problem already existed in the plowing group and wheat-cutting group before the establishment of the year-round mutual aid team. At that time, everyone thought that it didn't matter who suffered a little or took a little advantage when sisters were together, so this problem was not raised. Now that the team has expanded, the problem has been exposed. They started to keep work records, but the method was very unscientific. Whoever did a day's work would get a work point. The busy were busy, the idle were idle, and the people who did more work were unhappy. But everyone still couldn't break through the face and didn't offer any opinions. Once, Cui Yuxia took fourteen people to hoe the ground and hoeed seven mu in one day; another fifteen people hoeed together and only hoeed four and a half mu in one day, and their labor was still very strong. Cui Yuxia fully understood that the work recording method was not good. At this time, there was only their mutual aid team in the village, and there was no way to learn experience from others. So she thought of a way herself and studied it in detail with the masses. Finally, she determined a more reasonable method of work evaluation and point calculation: first, according to the weight of the work, evaluate the standard points, and then, according to the strength of each person's ability and physical strength, evaluate the scores. After finishing a day's work, evaluate the work and calculate the points on the spot and record them on the drawn form, and clear the accounts once a season. Everyone agreed to this method. After implementing this method, a new atmosphere appeared in the team. Team member Cui Deying used to gamble and play and was a loafer. When the team beat gongs to gather to work, he was never seen, and people had to be sent everywhere to find him. When working, he would rest three times for every move, doing the least. After the new method was implemented, the team changed to using whistles to gather to work. One whistle for preparation, two whistles for gathering, and three whistles for departure. Now, as soon as the first whistle was blown, he had already prepared everything and was just waiting to go to the field. He worked quickly and well, becoming one of the top activists in the team. This was partly because the work calculation method was reasonable and partly because criticism and self-criticism were carried out. After the unfair work recording incident that time, Cui Yuxia specially held a self-criticism meeting for all team members, first criticizing her own shortcomings in not leading well, and then launching criticism and self-criticism. Everyone offered each other opinions, and the lazy people and loafers expressed their determination to correct themselves. The entire team also formulated systems such as democratic management and strengthening learning at the meeting, and stipulated the method of holding regular meetings and inspecting work. Since then, the whole team has been as united as one person, and the enthusiasm for labor has been greatly improved.
    In terms of cultivation, Cui Yuxia's mutual aid team has also been continuously improving. From shallow plowing to deep plowing, from not selecting seeds to selecting seeds, from sparse planting to relatively dense planting, from less fertilization to more fertilization; coupled with the reasonable use of labor, the result was the creation of a large-area high-yield wheat record. Locally, each mu of land only yields more than one hundred catties to two hundred catties. Their entire team of 120 mu of wheat land yielded an average of 336 catties per mu last year; this year, the average yield per mu was 344 catties (410 catties when not dried), of which four mu of high-yield land averaged 572.5 catties per mu. They plan to make the average yield of ordinary wheat land 415 catties per mu next year, and the average yield of 8.33 mu of high-yield land must reach 580 catties per mu. The wheat in their team grows particularly tall and strong, and compared with the neighboring land, you can tell the difference at a glance. Other crops in the team also grow particularly well.
    After organizing, especially after the high yield, the living conditions of the entire team have undergone significant changes. At the beginning of the organization, the entire team only had one donkey, but now they have four cows and five donkeys. The public means of production have gone from zero to something. Now they have two cows, two seven-inch plows, as well as earth plows, sprayers, five-tooth cultivators, and a set of large mills and oil presses. The entire team has built seven new houses this year, and every family has repaired their houses. Of the fourteen households in the entire team, eleven were originally poor peasants, but now they have all risen to become middle peasants.
    When the masses inside and outside the team mention Cui Yuxia, their hearts are filled with love. The members of Cui Yuxia's mutual aid team say a word, and the masses outside the team attach great importance to it. The entire Zhao场乡 township launched the "Cui Yuxia Mutual Aid Team" movement. In this movement, the number of farmers organized in the entire township has increased from 10% to 60%, and 80% of the farmers in Wu宅村 village have joined the mutual aid team.
    This mutual aid team has developed into an agricultural production cooperative in July this year. Cui Yuxia knows that she will encounter some new difficulties during the transition, but she and the people of the entire team are confident in overcoming them. Cui Yuxia said: "After seeing Chairman Mao (Cui Yuxia went to Beijing this year to participate in the National Day celebrations and saw Chairman Mao), my whole body is filled with strength. In the past, I would worry when I encountered difficulties, but now I am not afraid of anything. With the leadership of the Party and the support of the masses, everything can be done well."

    一个年轻的女互助组长
    吴培华
    苏北睢寗县姚集区赵场乡吴宅村崔玉霞互助组，被中央农业部评为一九五一年度“旱地冬小麦丰产模范互助组”。这个互助组的组长崔玉霞，今年只有二十岁，是个年青的共产党员。她在各项工作中都表现了良好的成绩，在县里获得五个模范和功臣的称号。
    一个二十岁的姑娘，怎么能够领导互助组，并使它成为模范互助组呢？她的能力是从那儿来的呢？她诚恳地说：“我的经验很少，我是一面做一面学；我知道要想把工作作好，必须紧紧地依靠党，依靠群众；人要正派，要讲民主，有事和群众商量，处处为群众打算。”
    一九五○年一月，苏北淮阴地区闹水灾，睢寗县全部成了灾区。县里召开了扩大干部会议，号召农民“组织起来，生产救灾，保证不饿死一人”。崔玉霞那时是乡妇女会主任，也参加了这个会议。她怀着满腔热情回到村里，找村长商谈本村的生产救灾计划。当时村长有些犹豫，因为保证不饿死一个人，这不是一件简单的事。崔玉霞想：我是一个共产党员，应该担负起这个严重的任务。她在乡指导员的鼓励下，帮助村长订了计划，而且首先签上了自己的名字。计划拿到区里，区长看了，对着崔玉霞说：“真行！计划订得不错，立刻实行吧！”又鼓励了她一番，还和她研究了具体的做法。这时，她想：有党和人民政府的领导，不饿死一个人的任务是一定可以完成的。
    吴宅村有二十一户贫农，生活很困难。其中最困难的五户，男人早已去修淮河了；现在遇到灾荒，女人和孩子没有饭吃，整天缩在草堆里，生活十分凄苦。崔玉霞到各家要来一些稀粥，又借了一些胡萝卜，给这些妇女、孩子吃。然后把这五家的九个妇女组织起来，成立了一个纺纱小组；崔玉霞拿出自己积存的二斤棉花，给纺纱小组作原料，自己也抽功夫去帮助纺纱。她动员全村互助互济，进行各种副业生产。到三月里，全村不仅胜利地度过了灾荒，还节约出八百斤粮食，救济了本乡及外乡的灾民。
    不久，崔玉霞接到河工们从淮河工地联名写来的信，感谢她的支持。在这以前，纺纱小组已把家中战胜灾荒的情况写信告诉了他们。
    三月里，县领导机关召开扩大干部会议，崔玉霞被评为生产救灾二等功臣。领导同志在会上号召“及时春耕，保证不荒一亩地”。崔玉霞当场保证完成这一任务，并订出计划向各乡挑战。
    回村以后，她就发动妇女进行春耕，把纺纱小组改成了拉犁小组。那时导沂工程已经开始，村中男劳动力大部分修河去了，村里缺乏牲口，多数妇女没有种地的经验，拉犁播种是困难的。她自己长得瘦伶伶的，力气不大，也没有干过地里的重活。但她没有在困难面前退缩，她找了个老农民，学会了拉犁耕地，就去帮助妇女拉犁小组拉犁。头一天，十个人累得直不起腰，总共耕了二亩半地，而且耕得不成行。有些妇女灰心了；孩子又在家中哭闹，更影响了她们的情绪。崔玉霞发了愁，饭也吃不下，盘算孩子的问题。她想起她伯母最疼孩子，她十二岁时死了母亲，她们弟妹都是依偎她老人家长大的。她于是去请她老人家，给下地做活的妇女带孩子；经过奔走说服，把带孩子的问题解决了。妇女拉犁小组的组员都安心下地，效率很快提高到每天耕四亩。
    麦子熟了，她以妇女拉犁小组为基础，又吸收了一些男劳动力参加，组织了一个割麦组，很快割完了麦子，动员剩余的人力到外地作零工，赚了五百二十斤小麦。组外有些人看到合伙做事的好处，就要求加入。到秋天，崔玉霞就和大伙合计，正式成立了常年互助组，并被推选为组长。
    到年底，崔玉霞互助组发展到十三户，六十四口人（今年全组已发展到十四户，六十七口人）。组大了，崔玉霞也胆怯起来了：像自己这样缺乏领导经验，怎样能把互助组领导好呢？组里男女老小都安慰她说：玉霞，别发愁，有事大伙儿想办法，能行！果然，崔玉霞紧紧依靠了群众，特别是依靠了组里的共产党员、青年团员等骨干分子，有事和大家商量，真把互助组搞好了。
    评工计分是互助组成立以来遇到的最大的问题，也是能不能搞好互助组的关键。其实这个问题在常年互助组成立以前，在拉犁组、割麦组里就已经存在了。那时候，大家都认为姊妹们在一起，谁吃些亏占些便宜没有关系，所以没有提出这个问题。现在组扩大了，问题就暴露出来了。他们开始实行记工，但是办法很不科学，谁做一天活，就给记上一工。忙的忙，闲的闲，干活多的人心里不痛快。但大家还打不破情面，都不提意见。有一次，崔玉霞带了十四个人去锄地，一天锄了七亩；另有十五个人在一起锄地，一天只锄了四亩半，而且他们的劳力还很强。记工办法不好，崔玉霞完全明白了。村里这时还只有她们这一个互助组，没法向别人学习经验。于是她自己想办法，又和群众详细研究，最后确定了一个比较合理的计工评分办法：先根据活的轻重，评出标准分，再根据各个人能力和体力的强弱，评出分数。做完一天活，就在地头评工计分，记在画好的表格上，一季清算一次。大家都同意这个办法。实行了这个办法以后，组里就出现了新气象。组员崔德英过去好赌好玩，是个二流子，组里敲锣集合去干活，总不见他的影子，还得派人到处找他；干活的时候，他一动三歇，作的最少。实行了新办法以后，组里改用吹哨集合干活的办法，一遍哨准备，二遍哨集合，三遍哨出发；如今只吹一遍哨，他早就把一切都齐备好，单等上地了，干起活来也快也好，变成了组里一个头等的积极分子。这一方面是因为计工办法合理了，另方面也是开展了批评和自我批评的结果。那次锄地记工不公的事情发生以后，崔玉霞特地召开了一个全体组员检讨会，首先检讨了自己领导得不够好的缺点，接着，展开批评和自我批评。大家彼此提了意见，懒汉和二流子都表示了改正的决心。全组在会上还订出了民主管理和加强学习等制度，并规定了定期开会，检查工作的办法。从此，全组团结得像一个人一样，劳动积极性大大提高了。
    在耕作方面，崔玉霞互助组也不断地有改进。从浅耕到深耕，从不选种到选种，从稀植到比较密植，从施肥少到施肥多；加上劳动力的合理使用，结果就创造出了大面积的小麦丰产纪录。当地每亩地只收一百多斤到二百多斤。他们全组一百二十亩麦地，去年平均每亩收麦三百三十六斤；今年平均每亩收麦三百四十四斤（没晒干时是四百一十斤），其中四亩丰产地，每亩平均收五百七十二斤半。她们计划明年使普通麦地平均每亩收获四百十五斤，八亩三分丰产地每亩平均要收五百八十斤。她们组里的麦子长得特别高壮，和地邻相比，一眼就能分出高低。组里其他的庄稼也长得特别好。
    组织起来以后，特别是丰产以后，全组的生活状况起了显著的变化。开始组织起来的时候，全组只有一头驴，现在已经有了四条牛五头驴。公有的生产资料从无到有，现在已经有两条牛、两张七吋步犁、还有土犁、喷雾器、五齿中耕器和一套大碾、油榨。全组今年已盖了七间新屋，家家都修理了房子。全组十四户，原来就有十一户是贫农，现在都已上升为中农了。
    组里组外群众提起崔玉霞，心里就充满着热爱。崔玉霞互助组的组员说一句话，组外群众都很重视。赵场乡全乡曾开展“崔玉霞互助组”运动，在这个运动中，全乡组织起来的农民已从百分之十增加到百分之六十，吴宅村有百分之八十的农民都参加了互助组。
    这个互助组在今年七月已经发展为农业生产合作社了。崔玉霞晓得在转变的时候，又会碰到一些新的困难；但她和全组的人都有信心克服它。崔玉霞说：“见过毛主席以后，（崔玉霞今年曾到北京参加国庆节盛典，见了毛主席）混身充满力量。过去遇到困难还发愁，如今什么都不怕了。有党的领导，有群众的支持，什么都能做好。”（附图片）
