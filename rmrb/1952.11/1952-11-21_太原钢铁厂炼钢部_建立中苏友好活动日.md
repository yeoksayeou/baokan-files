    Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Steelmaking Department
    Establishes Sino-Soviet Friendship Activity Day
    [Report from this newspaper] Since August, the Steelmaking Department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant has established a "Sino-Soviet Friendship Activity Day" system. Over the past three months, the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Activity Day" has promoted the achievements of the Soviet Union in construction and the superiority of Soviet advanced experience, playing an important role in encouraging employees to learn from Soviet advanced experience.
    Over the past three years, Soviet experts have provided great assistance to the production of the Steelmaking Department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, enabling significant improvements in technology related to smelting, furnace repair, and ingot casting. In order to further guide employees in learning from Soviet advanced experience, in August of this year, the leaders of the Steelmaking Department Branch of the Chinese Communist Party, the Steelmaking Department Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the administration, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League, after joint research, decided to establish a "Sino-Soviet Friendship Activity Day."
    The "Sino-Soviet Friendship Activity Day" is held during the spare time of employee shift changes every Sunday, based on the characteristics of the three-shift production system. Each activity day lasts for a maximum of one hour. The content of the activity day includes discussing the implementation of Soviet expert suggestions, as well as reports by engineers, model workers, and workshop directors on the achievements of Soviet socialist construction and the living conditions of the Soviet people. For example, engineer Pang Dingchang explained the Soviet "rapid steelmaking method" to the workers, which greatly interested them. Some workers said: "This activity day not only enhances our understanding of the Soviet Union, but also allows us to learn advanced technology."
    The Steelmaking Department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant has conducted twelve "Sino-Soviet Friendship Activity Days" in the past three months. Each time, the activities revolve around the central work. Employees generally feel that each activity has new content and new gains. Currently, more than 90% of the employees consciously participate in the activity day. This method effectively promotes Soviet advanced experience, and the suggestions of Soviet experts, which were previously understood only by a few engineering and technical personnel, are now understood by the majority of employees. For example, when inspecting quality, the problem of high product defects was serious. After the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Activity Day" mobilized employees to study Soviet expert suggestions on eliminating subcutaneous bubbles in steel ingots, the quality of the steel was improved. Furthermore, in October, when the department initially promoted the Soviet "rapid steelmaking method," it proceeded very smoothly because this advanced method was widely understood and trusted by the employees, thus overfulfilling the monthly production plan. The experience of the Steelmaking Department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant proves that the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Activity Day" system is a good form of activity for members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and employees in factories and workshops to learn from Soviet advanced experience. The Taiyuan City Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is now vigorously promoting this activity method to the grassroots organizations of Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in various factories throughout the city.

### 太原钢铁厂炼钢部  建立中苏友好活动日

    太原钢铁厂炼钢部
    建立中苏友好活动日
    【本报讯】太原钢铁厂炼钢部，自八月份起建立了“中苏友好活动日”制度。三个月来，通过“中苏友好活动日”，宣传苏联在建设事业上的成就和苏联先进经验的优越性，对于职工们学习苏联的先进经验起了重要作用。
    三年来，苏联专家对于太原钢铁厂炼钢部的生产给了极大的帮助，使炼钢部在冶炼、修炉、制锭等技术方面有了显著的改进。为了更进一步领导职工学习苏联先进经验，今年八月，中共炼钢部支部、炼钢部中苏友好协会、行政、工会和青年团负责人经过了共同研究，决定建立“中苏友好活动日”。
    “中苏友好活动日”是根据三班制生产的特点，利用每个星期日职工大换班的空暇时间举行，每次活动日时间至多一小时。每三周内，全体职工都能参加一次活动。活动日的内容，除了讨论对苏联专家建议的执行的情况外，还由工程师、劳动模范、车间主任等报告苏联社会主义建设的成就和苏联人民的生活情况等。例如工程师庞定昌给工友们讲解苏联的“快速炼钢法”，就使职工们感到很大的兴趣。有的工人说：“这个活动日不但能提高对苏联的认识，还能学到先进技术。”
    太原钢铁厂炼钢部三个月来进行了十二次“中苏友好活动日”。每次都围绕着中心工作进行。职工们普遍感到每次活动有新的内容和新的收获。目前百分之九十以上的职工都自觉地参加活动日。这样的活动方法，有力地推广了苏联的先进经验，过去只为少数工程技术人员所懂得的苏联专家的建议，现已为广大职工所了解。例如在检查质量时，暴露出产品质量不高的问题很严重，通过“中苏友好活动日”，发动职工对苏联专家关于消灭钢锭皮下汽泡的建议进行研究后，就提高了钢的质量。又如十月份，该部在初步推行苏联“快速炼钢法”时，因为这一先进方法普遍为职工们所了解和信任，进行得非常顺利，因而超额完成了全月生产计划。太原钢铁厂炼钢部的经验证明：“中苏友好活动日”制度是工厂、车间中苏友好协会会员与职工学习苏联先进经验的良好活动形式。现在太原市中苏友好协会，正向全市各工厂中苏友好协会基层组织大力推行这一活动方式。
