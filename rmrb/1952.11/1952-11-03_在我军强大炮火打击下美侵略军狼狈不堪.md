    The heroic battles recently conducted by the Korean and Chinese People's forces on the Korean front have inflicted heavy losses on the U.S. aggressor troops. Recent news released by American news agencies reveals the U.S. military's miserable situation.

    A United Press reporter accompanying the U.S. Marine Corps revealed on October 30th the situation of two platoons of the U.S. Marine Corps risking an invasion and receiving severe punishment from the powerful artillery fire of the Korean and Chinese side. He wrote: "Eighty-six terrified Marine Corps soldiers made their way up the mountain... This was a night attack that American soldiers disliked and feared the most. As they gradually advanced in the dark, starless night, each soldier was thinking: I wonder if this attack will be the last." "Less than half an hour after the battle began, the Communist artillery fire killed or wounded 40 percent of the soldiers in the two platoons of Marine Corps." The entire unit was thrown into chaos and disarray, "even Captain Evans, the company commander, could not say what happened on that night of melee."

    The U.S. aggressor troops also suffered heavy blows in the counter-attack launched by the Korean and Chinese People's forces. United Press reporter Mallick described on October 28th the miserable appearance of the U.S. Marine Corps after being severely attacked in the area northeast of Panmunjom known as "Hook Mountain." He wrote: "Marine Corps soldiers lay along the dusty road, some asleep from exhaustion, others waiting in line for food. They had just come from the blood-stained Hook Mountain... A lieutenant stood a few yards away among a group of Marine Corps soldiers, reading the roster of a company, shaking his head grimly as he read the notes next to the names of the dead, wounded, and missing. Officer Walker took a handkerchief from his blood-stained trouser pocket and wiped the mud and sweat from his face, saying, 'We had no place to hide. All the bunkers were destroyed, and the trenches were half-filled. ... Then the snipers started shooting at us. Those guys can really shoot. They were shooting at us, but we didn't even know where they were.'"

    Why did the U.S. aggressor troops have no "place to hide"? That was the result of the devastating bombardment by the powerful artillery of the Korean and Chinese People's forces. United Press, Tokyo, reported on the 28th: "They fired a total of 17,000 shells at a Marine Corps regiment." Therefore, an American officer said: "This is the most intense bombardment a Marine Corps regiment has ever suffered."

    The troops of America's "allies" have also suffered significant casualties. A United Press reporter accompanying the Canadian Brigade reported on the 29th about the situation of Canadian soldiers being attacked on a hill west of Yeoncheon, saying: "The Chinese troops began their attack at dusk on October 23rd. Major Cohen, the company commander of the Canadian company that was attacked, said: 'Suddenly it was dark and chaotic. Artillery and mortar shells rained down like a downpour... Our bunkers were destroyed. Most of our weapons and ammunition were buried under the soil and pillars of the destroyed bunkers. The enemy artillery destroyed everything.' Soldier Stewart, clutching an injured shoulder, said: 'I really don't know how anyone got out alive. There were injured people everywhere.'" The reporter also revealed that the U.S. military authorities, in order to cover up the heavy losses suffered by the Canadian army, "detained" the "news of the Canadian soldiers' battle" for "seven days."

    The above-mentioned battle examples eloquently illustrate that the future for the U.S. aggressors to continue and expand the war of aggression will never be pleasant.

### 在我军强大炮火打击下美侵略军狼狈不堪

    在我军强大炮火打击下美侵略军狼狈不堪
    【新华社二日讯】朝中人民部队最近在朝鲜前线进行的英勇战斗，使美国侵略军遭到惨重的损失。最近美国通讯社所发出的新闻，透露了美军狼狈不堪的情况。
    合众社随美国海军陆战队记者十月三十日透露了美国海军陆战队二个排冒险进犯遭到朝中方面强大炮火严厉惩罚的情形。他写道：“八十六个害怕的海军陆战队士兵一路攻上山去。……这是一次美国士兵最不喜欢和最害怕的夜间攻击。当他们在漆黑的无星月的夜间渐渐前进时，每个士兵都在想：不知道这次出击是不是最后一次出击。”“战斗开始，不到半个钟头，共军的炮火击毙或击伤两排海军陆战队中的百分之四十的士兵”。整个这支部队被打得一片混乱，狼狈万状，“甚至连长伊凡斯上尉都说不出在那个进行混战的晚间发生了些什么事。”
    美国侵略军在朝中人民部队发动的反击战中，也受到沉重的打击。合众社记者麦利克十月二十八日描写到美国海军陆战队在板门店东北被称为“钩形山”的地区受到痛击后的狼狈相。他写道：“海军陆战队的士兵沿着多尘的道路躺了下来，有些人因过度疲劳而睡着了，有些人排队等吃饭。他们是刚从血迹斑斑的钩形山来的。……一个少尉站在几码以外一群海军陆战队士兵中间，读着一连军队的名册，当他读到死伤和失踪人员名字旁边的附注时，他冷酷地摇着头。尉官瓦克从沾满血迹的袴袋中取出一条手巾，擦去脸上的泥汗说：‘我们没有隐蔽的地方。所有的地堡都被毁坏了，战壕里填满了一半。……于是狙击兵开始向我们射击。那些家伙真会射击。他们向我们开枪，可是我们连他们在什么地方都不知道。’”。
    为什么美国侵略军没有了“隐蔽的地方”呢？那是朝中人民部队的强大炮兵给予敌人以摧毁性轰击的结果。合众社东京二十八日消息说：“他们对海军陆战队一个团共发射了一万七千发炮弹”。因此，
    一个美国军官说：“这是海军陆战队一个团有史以来所受过的最猛烈的炮轰。”
    美国的“盟国”军队也同样受到重大的牺牲。随加拿大旅的合众社记者二十九日报道加拿大士兵在涟川以西的一个山头上受到打击的情形说：“中国军队在十月二十三日黄昏时分开始进攻。受到袭击的加拿大连的连长柯亨少校说：‘刹时天昏地暗。大炮、迫击炮炮弹如雨般的落下来。……我们的地堡被摧毁了。我们的大部分武器和弹药都被埋在毁坏了的地堡的泥土和柱子下面。敌军的大炮把什么都打毁了。’士兵斯蒂华特紧握着一只受了伤的肩膀说：‘我真不知道怎么会有人活着出来的。遍地都是受了伤的人。’”。该记者并透露：美军当局为了掩盖加拿大军遭受惨重损失的情形，把“加拿大士兵战斗的消息”，“扣押了七天”。
    上述战例，雄辩地说明了美国侵略者要继续和扩大进行侵略战争的前途，绝不会是美妙的。
