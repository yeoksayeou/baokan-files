Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang Telegram:

U.S. air bandits continue to frantically bomb peaceful villages in the suburbs of Pyongyang, wantonly massacring the elderly, women, and children.

On the evening of the 8th, U.S. B-29 bombers carried out indiscriminate and frenzied bombing of peaceful rural areas in Kanju-ri and Ryongheung-ri in the western suburbs of Pyongyang. There were no "military targets" in or near the bombed area. The residents of this area included local farmers and many Pyongyang citizens who had evacuated here to escape the U.S. bombing, including free laborers and elderly, weak women and children who made a living by doing small business. That night, the U.S. planes killed and wounded more than 200 people, more than 20 head of cattle, and destroyed 151 civilian houses and cave dwellings. The buildings destroyed by the U.S. air bandits included the school building of the Pyongyang No. 38 People's School and the yard and wards of a hospital.

The people of Pyongyang and its suburbs, who have repeatedly suffered from the atrocities of U.S. air bandits, are filled with increasing anger towards the U.S. aggressors and are determined to further strengthen their work in support of the front lines and avenge the deaths of their compatriots.

    美机继续滥炸平壤郊区村庄
    【新华社平壤电】美国空中强盗继续疯狂轰炸平壤市郊和平村庄，大肆屠杀老人、妇女和儿童。
    八日晚，美国（B）二十九型轰炸机对平壤市西郊坎举里、龙兴里一带和平农村肆行狂轰滥炸。这个被轰炸的地区及其附近没有任何“军事目标”，在这个地区居住的，除了当地农民外，有很多是为了躲避美机轰炸而疏散到这里来的平壤市民，他们之中包括自由劳动者和做小生意维持生活的老弱妇孺。这晚美机炸死炸伤二百多人，耕牛二十多头，炸毁民房土窟一百五十一所。被美国空中强盗炸毁的建筑物中，包括平壤市第三十八人民学校的校舍和一个医院的院舍和病房。
    一再遭受美国空中强盗残害的平壤市及其郊区的人民怀着对美国侵略者愈来愈大的愤怒，决心进一步加强支援前线的工作，为死难的同胞报仇。
