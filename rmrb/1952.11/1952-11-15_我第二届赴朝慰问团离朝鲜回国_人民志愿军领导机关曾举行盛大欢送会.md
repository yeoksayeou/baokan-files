He concluded by saying: Now the supply situation of the Volunteer Army has improved, but we must still, based on the situation we have learned this time, ensure that we further support the Volunteer Army in all aspects to better strike at the American invading army.

Zhou Qin'yue, Deputy Head of the General Delegation, said in his speech: After we came to Korea, we learned a lot from the Volunteer Army. The countless heroic deeds of the Volunteer Army deeply moved us. We will definitely convey the Volunteer Army's concern for the motherland, the Volunteer Army's determination to defend the motherland and defend peace, and the Volunteer Army's heroic combat deeds to the people of the motherland, and at the same time call on the people of the whole country to further support the Volunteer Army in order to achieve greater victories.
