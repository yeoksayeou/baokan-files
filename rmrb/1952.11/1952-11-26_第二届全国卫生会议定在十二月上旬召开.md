Xinhua News Agency, November 24th:

    The Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government and the Health Department of the General Logistics Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government have decided to jointly convene the Second National Health Conference in early December this year.
    The First National Health Conference, held in August 1950, adopted the three major guiding principles of health work: "Serving workers, peasants, and soldiers," "Prevention first," and "Uniting Chinese and Western medicine." Over the past two years, the health departments have achieved great success due to the implementation of these correct principles, especially the nationwide patriotic health campaign this year, which has yielded significant results. The upcoming Second National Health Conference will mainly summarize the experiences of the patriotic health campaign over the past year, discuss how to rely on the masses to make the patriotic health campaign more universal, in-depth, and regular, and, based on the three major guiding principles of health work decided by the First National Health Conference, review the health work of the past two years and determine the direction of future efforts. The conference will commend and reward model workers and model units in the patriotic health campaign in various regions; at the same time, it will hold a "National Patriotic Health Campaign Exhibition."

    第二届全国卫生会议定在十二月上旬召开
    【新华社二十四日讯】中央人民政府卫生部和中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总后方勤务部卫生部决定在今年十二月上旬联合召开第二届全国卫生会议。
    一九五零年八月召开的第一届全国卫生会议，曾通过“面向工农兵”、“预防为主”、“团结中西医”的卫生工作三大方针。两年多来卫生部门由于执行了这些正确的方针，取得了伟大的成就，特别是今年全国大规模的爱国卫生运动成绩很大。即将召开的第二届全国卫生会议，主要是总结一年来爱国卫生运动的经验，讨论如何依靠群众使爱国卫生运动更普遍、深入和经常化，并根据第一届全国卫生会议决定的卫生工作三大方针，来检查两年多来的卫生工作和确定今后努力的方向。会议将评选和奖励各地区爱国卫生运动中的模范工作者和模范单位；同时举办“全国爱国卫生运动展览会”。
