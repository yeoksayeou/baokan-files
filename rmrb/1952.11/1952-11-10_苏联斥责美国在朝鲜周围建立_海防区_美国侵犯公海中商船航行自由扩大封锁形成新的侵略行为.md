    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 5th] TASS, Moscow, November 5th: On November 4th, the Soviet Embassy in Washington delivered the following note to the U.S. State Department:
    "The Embassy of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, under instructions from the Soviet Government, hereby issues the following statement:
    According to U.S. newspaper reports, on September 27th of this year, it was announced that the U.S. Navy Department had established a so-called sea defense zone around the Korean Peninsula, including Korean territorial waters and a considerable portion of international waters. It is claimed that this zone will be placed under the control of the Commander of U.S. Naval Forces in the Far East, and any ships entering this zone, regardless of their nationality, will be searched.
    It is known that, in view of the U.S. government's establishment of a naval blockade along the Korean coast in July 1950, the Soviet government, in its note to the U.S. government on July 6th, 1950, pointed out that the establishment of such a blockade is an act of aggression, which, like the entire U.S. armed intervention in Korea, is contrary to the principles of the United Nations.
    The establishment of the "sea defense zone" is, in essence, an expansion of the illegal naval blockade implemented by the United States off the Korean coast in 1950, and is thus a new act of aggression in the Far East. This action once again proves that the government of the United States of America is not seeking to end the Korean War, but is instead taking new acts of aggression.
    The establishment of this zone infringes on the freedom of navigation of merchant ships in international waters and, therefore, infringes on the rights of the Soviet Union and other countries.
    The Soviet government does not recognize the legality of this so-called sea defense zone established by the U.S. government around Korea. The U.S. government shall bear full responsibility for the consequences arising from this latest act of aggression and for any damage that may be suffered by Soviet interests."

    苏联斥责美国在朝鲜周围建立“海防区”
    美国侵犯公海中商船航行自由扩大封锁形成新的侵略行为
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科五日讯：十一月四日，苏联驻华盛顿大使馆以下列照会交给美国国务院。
    “苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟大使馆奉苏联政府训令，特发表声明如下：
    据美国报纸消息，本年九月二十七日，据宣布美国海军部已在朝鲜半岛周围建立了一个包括朝鲜领海和相当一部分公海在内的所谓海防区，并称这个区将置于美国驻远东海军部队司令的控制之下，进入这个区的任何船只都将予以搜查，不问它是那一国的。
    大家知道，鉴于美国政府于一九五零年七月在朝鲜沿海建立了海军封锁，苏联政府曾在一九五零年七月六日致美国政府的照会中，指出建立这种封锁是一种侵略行为，这种封锁正像美国武装干涉朝鲜的整个行为一样，是与联合国的原则相抵触的。
    “海防区”的建立，本质上是美国于一九五零年在朝鲜沿海非法实施的海军封锁的扩大，因而是在远东的一种新的侵略行动，这种行动再一次证明，美利坚合众国政府不是设法结束朝鲜战争，而是采取了新的侵略行为。
    建立这种地带是侵犯公海中商船航行的自由，因而是侵犯苏联及其他国家的权利。
    苏联政府不承认美国政府在朝鲜周围建立的这种所谓海防区是合法的，对于由最近这次侵略行为所引起的后果，及对于苏联利益所可能遭受的损害，美国政府应负完全责任。”
