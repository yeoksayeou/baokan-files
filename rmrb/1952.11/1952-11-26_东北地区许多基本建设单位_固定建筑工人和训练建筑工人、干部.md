Many basic construction units in Northeast China have begun to fix construction workers and train construction workers and cadres.

The First Engineering Company of the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government began in mid-November to concentrate on training 2,000 cadres and 17,000 technical workers; 300 site directors and 1,000 construction workers were promoted from among the workers. According to the needs of next year's project, they plan to open ten training classes for site directors, construction workers, wages, accounting statistics, marking, materials, tools, etc., for phased training. The First, Second, and Third Engineering Companies affiliated to the Shenyang Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau will fix 6,000 construction workers as permanent workers this year and train them in winter. The Hegang Mining Bureau Construction Company plans to open a construction worker school with more than 1,300 people, planning to train 500 odd-job workers into masons, carpenters, and mining workers within six months; at the same time, it will focus on training existing squad leaders, recorders, efficiency officers, and others. The Songjiang Provincial Engineering Company currently has 600 fixed workers, and will fix another 1,950 people this winter. They have formulated specific plans and organized working groups to assist in this work at various construction sites. In order to train administrative management cadres, the company recruited 450 higher primary school graduates in October and conducted training. Various basic construction units in Jiamusi City are currently actively carrying out the registration and review of fixed construction workers, and after the project is completed, they can quickly transition to winter training.

In addition to formulating specific plans for fixing construction workers and training construction workers and cadres, many basic construction units have also actively prepared for other tasks related to these tasks. For example, the First Engineering Company of the Northeast Industrial Department summarized various advanced experiences in September as teaching materials for winter worker training, and worker dormitories and other facilities are also ready. The Shenyang Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau is building a dormitory that can accommodate 6,000 fixed construction workers. The construction area of this project is 15,000 square meters, and the total investment is more than 13.5 billion yuan. In July and August, the Songjiang Provincial Engineering Company built dormitories, clubs, restaurants, bathhouses, barbershops, health clinics, etc. that could accommodate more than 1,000 workers; in early October, another worker dormitory with an area of 6,000 square meters was started.

    东北地区许多基本建设单位
    固定建筑工人和训练建筑工人、干部
    东北地区许多基本建设单位开始进行了固定建筑工人和训练建筑工人、干部的工作。
    东北人民政府工业部第一工程公司在本月中旬开始，集中训练了两千名干部和一万七千名技术工人；从工人中提拔三百名工地主任、一千名施工员；按明年工程需要，他们准备开办工地主任、施工员、工资、会计统计、标定、材料、工具等十个训练班，进行分期训练。沈阳市建筑工程局所属第一、第二、第三工程公司，今年将固定六千名建筑工人为常年工人，并在冬季加以训练。鹤岗矿务局建设公司准备开办一个一千三百多人的建筑工人学校，计划在六个月内把五百名杂工分别培养成瓦工、木工和掘进工人；同时，集中训练现有班长、记录员、效率员等人。松江省工程公司现有六百名固定工人，今冬还要固定一千九百五十人。他们已订立了具体计划，并组织工作组到各工地协助进行这项工作。该公司为培养行政管理干部，曾在十月份招收了四百五十名高小毕业学生，进行了训练。佳木斯市各基本建设单位，目前正积极进行固定建筑工人的登记、审查工作，待工程结束后，就可以迅速转入冬季训练。
    许多基本建设单位除了制订固定建筑工人和训练建筑工人、干部的具体计划外，并积极地作好了有关这些工作的其他各项准备工作。如东北工业部第一工程公司，在九月份就总结了各项先进经验，作为冬季训练工人的教材，工人宿舍等也已准备就绪。沈阳市建筑工程局正建筑一座能容纳六千人的宿舍给固定的建筑工人居住，这一工程的施工面积共有一万五千平方公尺，全部投资额在一百三十五亿元以上。松江省工程公司在七、八月份，就修建了能容纳一千多名工人的宿舍以及俱乐部、饭厅、澡塘子、理发馆、卫生所等；十月初旬又开工修建了另一座有六千平方公尺面积的工人宿舍。    （新华社）
