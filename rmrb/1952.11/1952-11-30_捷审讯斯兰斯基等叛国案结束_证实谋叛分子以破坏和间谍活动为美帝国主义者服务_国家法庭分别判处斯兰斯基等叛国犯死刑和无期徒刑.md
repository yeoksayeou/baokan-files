(TASS, Prague) The Czechoslovak State Court continued its trial of Rudolf Slánský and his accomplices in the anti-state conspiracy case from the evening of the 20th to the 26th. The trial concluded on the 27th, and the verdicts were announced.

On the evening of the 20th, the court questioned numerous witnesses, all of whom testified to the criminal activities of Slánský and his accomplices. The former Czechoslovak Ambassador to Israel, Goldstücker, a member of the traitorous conspiracy center, testified that he had engaged in espionage activities under the orders of Slánský and B. Geminder, passing intelligence to British agent Zilliacus. While in Israel, Goldstücker had helped Slánský establish connections with some "Zionists." Another witness, British agent Mordechai Oren, said that he had met with representatives of the fascist Tito group and learned from their conversations that Slánský had direct cooperation with the Tito group. Former Ambassador to Bern, Jaromír Kopecký, testified that Slánský had passed intelligence to Allen Dulles, head of the American intelligence agency in Europe, through František Gračner.

On the morning of the 21st, the court questioned B. Geminder, the former head of the International Department of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee, who was Slánský's closest accomplice. He confessed that as early as 1921, he had sided with the reactionary German nationalist group, and in 1930 he became a fanatical Trotskyite. After 1946, he helped Slánský install Trotskyite spies and bandits in the state organs of the Czechoslovak Republic. In addition to serving the British intelligence agency, Geminder also colluded with the Titoists and conspired to overthrow the people's democratic system of Czechoslovakia. Both testimonial and material evidence confirmed Geminder's crimes.

On the afternoon of the 21st, the court questioned Vladimír Clementis, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Czechoslovakia. He directly admitted to being one of the chief culprits of the conspiracy center, a loyal servant of former Czech President Beneš, and an agent of the imperialist intelligence agencies. He shamelessly said that he had passed intelligence to American Ambassador Steinhardt, French Ambassador Dejean, and British Ambassador Nichols, among others. The court then questioned numerous witnesses, all of whom confirmed Clementis' crimes.

On the morning of the 22nd, after continuing to question the defendant Clementis, the court successively questioned Artur London, the former Deputy Minister in charge of cadre work at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a Trotskyite, and Vávro Hajdů, another former Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. London confessed that he was an active member of this anti-state conspiracy center and also a contact person between the spy Slánský and the British spy Zilliacus. He systematically supplied secret intelligence about the situation in Czechoslovakia to Noël Field and others, who were confidants of Allen Dulles. Hajdů confessed that he had contacted Clementis in Paris in 1939, and in the summer of 1941, he joined the British intelligence agency in Britain.

On the afternoon of the 22nd, after hearing witness testimonies, the court proceeded to question Andrej Simone, the former editor of "Red Right News." He confessed to the court that he had become a Trotskyite in 1926, first engaging in sabotage activities in the German Communist Party and later in the French workers' movement. In 1939, he joined the French intelligence agency, and in the same year, he signed a contract with the British spy Paul Willert. Later, he was hired by the American agent Schoenbrun in New York. He also confessed that he had introduced the British spy Zilliacus into the Czechoslovak press at Slánský's order, letting him write articles praising the Tito group. The court then questioned another defendant, Ludvík Frejka, one of the main culprits of Slánský's conspiracy center and former head of the economic department of the President's Office, who directly admitted to having acted as a British spy since 1940.

On the morning of the 23rd, the court continued to question Frejka. After questioning witnesses, the court questioned Josef Frank, the former Deputy Secretary-General of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee. In 1939, he abused Soviet and French prisoners of war in the Buchenwald death camp in Germany and compiled a list of prisoners for the fascists to execute. After the war, he escaped the trial of the military court and became one of Slánský's closest assistants. Frank also confessed in detail to the conspiracy activities of the traitor Slánský, who wanted to get rid of Klement Gottwald in order to make himself the President of the Republic. Then, former Deputy Secretary-General of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee, Švábová, testified in court. She said that she was a member of the anti-state conspiracy center and had engaged in sabotage activities.

On the evening of the 23rd and the morning of the 24th, the State Court separately questioned Evžen Löbl and Rudolf Margolius, the former Deputy Ministers of Foreign Trade of Czechoslovakia; on the afternoon of the 24th, it questioned Otto Fischl, the former Deputy Minister of Finance of Czechoslovakia, and in the evening it questioned Otto Sling, the former Secretary of the Brno Regional Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party.

On the 25th, the State Court questioned Karel Šváb, the former Deputy Minister of National Security, and Bedřich Reicin, the former Deputy Minister of National Defense. On the morning of the 26th, the State Court examined the documents submitted by experts as evidence. When the court convened in the afternoon, the State Prosecutor summarized the results of the trial. The State Prosecutor finally requested that all defendants be sentenced to death. The court then heard the speeches of the defendants' defense lawyers. When the court convened in the evening, the defendants made their final defenses.

On the 27th, the State Court announced the charges against all defendants as follows: the defendants are all traitors of the Trotskyite-Titoist, Zionist, and bourgeois nationalist types, and are enemies of the Czechoslovak people, the people's democratic system, and socialism; they served American imperialists and, under the instructions of hostile Western intelligence agencies, organized an anti-state conspiracy center, conspiring to subvert the people's democratic system, sabotage socialist construction, damage the national economy, engage in espionage activities, weaken the unity of the Czechoslovak people and the defense capabilities of the Republic, in order to make the Republic abandon its close alliance and friendly relations with the Soviet Union, eliminate the people's democratic system of Czechoslovakia, restore capitalism, pull the Republic back into the imperialist camp, and undermine its national sovereignty and independence. Then the State Court sentenced Rudolf Slánský, Bedřich Geminder, Ludvík Frejka, Josef Frank, Vladimír Clementis, Bedřich Reicin, Karel Šváb, Rudolf Margolius, Otto Fischl, Otto Sling, and Andrej Simone to death; Artur London, Vávro Hajdů, and Evžen Löbl were sentenced to life imprisonment.

    二十日晚间，法庭讯问了许多证人，他们都证明了斯兰斯基和他的同谋犯的罪恶活动。前捷克斯洛伐克驻以色列大使、叛国阴谋中心的成员果尔德斯徒克作证说：他曾遵照斯兰斯基和贝·盖明德尔的命令从事间谍活动，把情报交给英国特务齐里亚库斯。在以色列时，果尔德斯徒克曾帮助斯兰斯基和一些“犹太复国主义”分子建立联系。另一证人英国的特务摩尔德采·奥尔登说：他曾经会晤法西斯铁托集团的代表，并从和他们的谈话中获悉斯兰斯基和铁托集团有直接的合作关系。前驻伯尔尼大使雅罗米尔·柯比斯基作证说：斯兰斯基曾通过佛朗蒂塞克·格拉查把情报传给驻欧洲美国情报机关负责人爱伦·杜勒斯。
    二十一日上午，法庭审问了斯兰斯基的最密切的同谋犯、前捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会国际部主任贝·盖明德尔。他供认：远在一九二一年他就已经投靠了反动的德国国家主义集团，一九三○年他成了狂热的托洛茨基分子。一九四六年后，他帮助斯兰斯基在捷克斯洛伐克共和国国家机关中安插托洛茨基间谍匪徒。盖明德尔除为英国间谍机关服务外，还和铁托分子勾结，并阴谋推翻捷克斯洛伐克的人民民主制度。人证和物证都证实了盖明德尔的罪行。
    二十一日下午，法庭审问了前捷克斯洛伐克外交部部长乌拉季米尔·克利门蒂斯。他直认是阴谋中心的首犯之一、同时是捷前总统贝奈斯的忠实仆役、帝国主义情报机关的特务。他恬不知耻地说：他曾传递情报给美国大使斯坦哈特，法国大使德让和英国大使尼科尔斯等。法庭接着询问许多证人，他们都证实了克利门蒂斯的罪行。
    二十二日上午，法庭在继续审问被告克利门蒂斯之后，先后审问了前外交部负责干部工作的副部长、托洛茨基分子阿图尔·隆登和另一前外交部副部长瓦夫罗·哈伊杜。隆登供认他是这个反国家阴谋中心的积极分子，同时又是间谍斯兰斯基和英国间谍齐里亚库斯的通讯联络人。他有系统地把关于捷克斯洛伐克情况的秘密情报供给爱伦·杜勒斯的亲信诺埃尔·费尔德等人。哈伊杜供认一九三九年他在巴黎时就与克利门蒂斯取得了联系，一九四一年夏，他在英国加入了英国情报机关。
    二十二日下午，法庭听取了证人作证后，接着就审问前“红色权利报”编辑安德烈·西蒙。他向法庭供认：他在一九二六年就成为托洛茨基分子，首先他在德国共产党中，后来又在法国工人运动中从事破坏活动。一九三九年他加入法国间谍机关，同年，他又和英国间谍保罗·威勒特签订了合同。后来又在纽约为美国特务淑恩布隆所雇用。他还供认曾遵照斯兰斯基的命令，将英国间谍齐里亚库斯引进了捷克斯洛伐克报界，让他写文章颂扬铁托集团。接着法庭审问另一个被告、斯兰斯基阴谋中心主犯之一、前共和国总统办公厅经济处处长卢德维克·佛雷伊卡，他直认从一九四○年起就充当了英国间谍。
    二十三日上午法庭继续审问佛雷伊卡。在讯问证人后，法庭审问了前捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会副总书记约瑟夫·弗兰克。一九三九年他在德国布痕瓦尔德死亡营中虐待苏联和法国战俘，并编制战俘名单供法西斯分子枪杀。战后，他逃脱了军事法庭的审讯而成了斯兰斯基最亲信的助手之一。弗兰克还详细供认了谋叛分子斯兰斯基为了想除掉克利门特·哥特瓦尔德而使自己成为共和国总统所进行的阴谋活动。然后，前捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会副总书记斯威莫娃出庭作证。她说：她是反国家阴谋中心的一分子，并曾从事破坏活动。

    二十七日国家法庭宣布所有被告的罪状如下：被告们都是托洛茨基——铁托、“犹太复国主义”和资产阶级民族主义等类的叛徒，同时是捷克斯洛伐克人民、人民民主制度和社会主义的敌人；他们为美帝国主义者服务并且在敌对的西方间谍机关的指使下，组织了一个反国家的阴谋中心，阴谋颠覆人民民主制度，破坏社会主义建设，损害国民经济，进行间谍活动，削弱捷克斯洛伐克人民的团结和共和国的国防能力，用这些来使共和国背弃它对苏联的亲密同盟和友好关系，消灭捷克斯洛伐克的人民民主制度，恢复资本主义，把共和国重新拉进帝国主义阵营并且破坏它的国家主权和独立。接着国家法庭宣判：鲁道夫·斯兰斯基，贝德里赫·盖明德尔，卢德维克·佛雷伊卡，约瑟夫·弗兰克，乌拉季米尔·克利门蒂斯，贝德里赫·雷伊辛，卡列尔·斯瓦勃，鲁道夫·玛尔果利乌斯，奥托·费希尔，奥托·斯林，安德烈·西蒙处以死刑；阿图尔·隆登，瓦夫罗·哈伊杜，伊夫仁·洛布尔处以无期徒刑。
