    Strengthen Sino-Soviet Friendship, Learn from Advanced Soviet Experience
    November 7th this year marks the 35th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union. The All-China Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has decided to hold a "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" across the country from November 7th to December 6th to celebrate this great festival that laid the foundation for the victory of the people of the world and to further develop and consolidate the friendly relations between the people of China and the Soviet Union. The All-China Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has issued notices and propaganda slogans, calling on people across the country to actively participate in Sino-Soviet friendship activities, learn from the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union in all fields, and study the great theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin on building a bright and happy socialist and communist society. Undoubtedly, this will be one of the most important events in the political life of our people.
    Sino-Soviet friendship is of paramount importance to our people. This is because the friendship and assistance of the Soviet Union to our people are decisive conditions for our people to win the victory of the cause of liberation, and to consolidate this victory and build our new country after the victory of the revolution.
    For thirty-five years, the leaders and teachers of the working people of the world – Lenin and Stalin, as well as the Soviet government and the Soviet people’s consistent friendship and assistance to our people, will never be forgotten by our people. The victory of the great October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union illuminated the road to liberation for our people; and the consistent friendship and assistance of the Soviet Union helped our people achieve the great victory of the revolution. After our people achieved revolutionary victory and established their own new country – the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union immediately established formal diplomatic relations with our government, becoming the first friendly country of our people. The "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance" signed in February 1950 gave the Chinese people a great ally that they had never had in their history, thereby consolidating the revolutionary victory already achieved by our people; at the same time, it enabled China's severely damaged economy to recover and develop rapidly. The Sino-Soviet talks held in Moscow in September this year further strengthened the Sino-Soviet alliance. The exchange of notes on extending the term of the joint Sino-Soviet use of the naval base at Lushunkou, which was announced as a result of the talks, is a great blow to the conspiracy of American imperialism to foster the resurgence of Japanese militarist forces.
    The historical task currently facing our people is, on the one hand, to continue to strengthen the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and defend peace, to continue to consolidate the victory of the Chinese people's revolution; on the other hand, to meet the large-scale economic construction and cultural construction that is about to begin, so that our country can gradually be transformed from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country, and from a new democratic country into a socialist country. The victorious completion of this new, great and arduous task depends on further developing and strengthening the Sino-Soviet friendship, mutual assistance and cooperation alliance.
    To ensure China's independence and security, and to defend peace in the Far East and the world, it is necessary to strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship. Everyone can see: the powerful strength of the Sino-Soviet friendship alliance is unmatched by any force in the past and present in human history. This powerful force is a strong fortress for defending peace and opposing aggression. It is precisely because of the existence of this powerful force that American imperialism does not dare to risk expanding the war of aggression against Korea; it is precisely because of the existence of this powerful force that the arrogant plan of American imperialism to foster the resurgence of Japanese militarist forces and use Japanese militarist forces to conquer and enslave Asia has aroused increasingly strong resistance in Japan and other Far Eastern countries; and it is precisely because of the existence of this powerful force that the arrogant plan of American imperialism to conquer and enslave the whole world has been constantly subjected to failure, and this arrogant plan will eventually be completely bankrupt.
    On the seventh anniversary of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War on September 3 this year, Chairman Mao Zedong said in a congratulatory telegram to Marshal Stalin: "Now, as Japanese militarism is reviving and Japanese aggressive forces are raising their heads again, the unbreakable friendly alliance between China and the Soviet Union is a powerful guarantee for jointly preventing the re-aggression of Japan and any country that colludes with Japan in aggressive acts, and for defending peace in the East and the world." Marshal Stalin said in his return telegram: "The great friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China is a reliable guarantee against new threats of aggression and a strong fortress of peace in the Far East and throughout the world." The facts of the past two years have proved and will continue to prove the above-mentioned brilliant论断 of Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin.
    In order to build our great country, it is necessary to strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship and learn from the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union in all fields. Three years of experience have proved that the economic assistance and economic cooperation provided by the Soviet Union to our country have a decisive role in the accelerated recovery and development of our country's economy. And learning from the Soviet Union's experience in building a socialist economy and building national defense is of inestimable importance to our people. In terms of economic construction, although the historical development conditions of our country are different from those of the Soviet Union after the victory of the revolution, the socialist state-owned economy of our country is the leading force in our social economy, and it has established a dominant position in our modern industrial economy; at the same time, in our country, the cooperative economy of the working people with socialist elements is also developing. Our country will definitely develop towards a socialist and communist society in the future. This makes it possible and necessary for us to learn from the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union in building socialist and communist societies, and to study the great theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin on building socialist and communist societies, in order to accelerate our economic construction cause. In terms of national defense construction, the Soviet army is an invincible army with the richest modern combat experience and armed with Stalinist military science. Therefore, the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers should strive to learn from the advanced Soviet military science in order to further build themselves into a completely modern and powerful army and strive to defend the construction of the motherland and defend world peace.

### 加强中苏友好，学习苏联先进经验

    加强中苏友好，学习苏联先进经验
    今年十一月七日是苏联十月社会主义革命三十五周年纪念日。中苏友好协会总会已决定从十一月七日起到十二月六日止在全国范围内举行“中苏友好月”，来庆祝这个奠定了全世界人民胜利局面的伟大节日，进一步发展与巩固中苏两国人民之间的友好关系。中苏友好协会总会业已发出通知及宣传口号等，号召全国人民都来积极地参加中苏友好活动，学习苏联的各项先进经验，学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林关于建设光明幸福的社会主义和共产主义社会的伟大学说。无疑地，这将是我们全国人民政治生活中最重大的事件之一。
    中苏友好对于我国人民是具有头等重要性的。这是因为苏联对于我国人民的友谊和援助，乃是我国人民争取解放事业的胜利，并在革命胜利之后巩固这个胜利并建设自己的新国家的具有决定意义的条件。
    三十五年来，全世界劳动人民的领袖和导师——列宁和斯大林、以及苏联政府和苏联人民对于我国人民的一贯的友谊和援助，是我国人民永世不忘的。苏联的伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利，照亮了我国人民的解放道路；而苏联的一贯的友谊和援助，则帮助我国人民达到了伟大的革命胜利。在我国人民取得革命胜利并成立自己的新国家——中华人民共和国之后，苏联立即与我国政府建立正式外交关系，成为我国人民的第一个友邦。在一九五○年二月间签订的“中苏友好同盟互助条约”，使得中国人民有了一个在自己的历史上从来没有过的伟大的同盟国，从而巩固了我国人民业已取得的革命胜利；同时使得我国被破坏得很严重的经济能够很快地恢复和发展起来。今年九月间在莫斯科举行的中苏谈判，又使中苏友好同盟进一步加强。这次谈判结果所公布的关于延长中苏两国共同使用旅顺口海军根据地期限的换文，对于美国帝国主义扶植日本军国主义势力再起的阴谋，是一个极大的打击。
    目前我国人民所面临着的历史性的任务，就是一方面要继续加强抗美援朝、保卫和平的斗争，来继续巩固我国人民革命的胜利；另一方面要迎接即将开始的大规模的经济建设和文化建设，来使我们的国家逐步地由落后的农业国变为先进的工业国，由新民主主义国家变为社会主义国家。这一新的伟大而艰巨的任务的胜利完成，都依靠于进一步发展和加强中苏友好互助合作同盟。
    为了保障我国的独立和安全，为了保卫远东和全世界的和平，必须加强中苏友好。谁都看得见：中苏友好同盟所具有的强大力量，是人类历史上在过去和现在都没有任何力量可以和它比拟的。这个强大力量，乃是保卫和平和反对侵略的坚强堡垒。正是由于这种强大力量的存在，美国帝国主义才不敢冒险地扩大侵略朝鲜的战争；正是由于这种强大力量的存在，美国帝国主义扶植日本军国主义势力再起、并利用日本军国主义势力来征服和奴役亚洲的狂妄计划，才在日本及远东各国引起了日益强有力的反抗；也正是由于这种强大力量的存在，美国帝国主义征服和奴役全世界的狂妄计划，才不断地遭受到失败，并且这个狂妄计划在最后必将完全破产。
    在今年九月三日抗日战争胜利七周年的时候，毛泽东主席在致斯大林大元帅的贺电中说：“现在，当着日本军国主义正在复活，日本侵略势力又重新抬头的时候，中国与苏联的牢不可破的友好同盟是共同制止日本和其他在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的任何国家之重新侵略、保卫东方与世界和平的有力保证。”斯大林大元帅在复电中说：“苏联和中华人民共和国之间的伟大友谊是反对新侵略威胁的可靠保证，是远东及全世界和平的坚强堡垒。”过去两年多以来的事实已经证明了、并且今后还将继续证明毛主席和斯大林大元帅的上述英明论断。
    为了建设我们的伟大国家，必须加强中苏友好，并学习苏联的各项先进经验。三年来的经验已经证明：苏联给予我国的经济援助和经济合作，对于我国经济的加速度的恢复和发展，有着决定的作用。而学习苏联建设社会主义经济和建设国防的经验，对于我国人民，更有着不可估量的重要性。就经济建设方面来说，我国的历史发展条件虽然不同于革命胜利后的苏联，但是我国社会主义性质的国营经济在我国社会经济中乃是领导的力量，它在我国现代工业经济中已经确立了优势的地位；同时，在我国，还发展着带有社会主义因素的劳动人民的合作经济。我们的国家，在将来是一定要向社会主义和共产主义社会发展的。这就使得我们能够而且必须学习苏联建设社会主义和共产主义社会的先进经验，学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林关于建设社会主义和共产主义社会的伟大学说，以便加速我们的经济建设事业。就国防建设方面来说，苏联军队乃是具有最丰富的现代化作战经验的、用斯大林军事科学武装起来的无敌的军队。因此，中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军要努力学习苏联先进的军事科学，以便进一步地把自己建设成为完全现代化的强大军队，为保卫祖国建设、为保卫世界和平而奋斗。
