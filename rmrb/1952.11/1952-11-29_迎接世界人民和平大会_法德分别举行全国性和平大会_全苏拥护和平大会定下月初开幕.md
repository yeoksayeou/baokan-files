Xinhua News Agency, 28th dispatch: According to TASS, Paris: The French people are actively preparing for the World People's Peace Congress. Paris held the People's Peace Congress and the French National Farmers' Peace Congress on the 22nd and 23rd respectively. Both conferences have elected delegates to attend the World People's Peace Congress.

    The People's Peace Congress, held on the 22nd in the hall of the Paris Exhibition Park, was attended by 50,000 representatives from factories, public organizations, and peace committees in various districts of Paris, as well as workers from the capital. The presidium of the congress was composed of the following individuals: Fajon, Chairman of the French National Peace Council; Madame Cotton, Chairman of the French Women's Union; Professors Buquinion, Hadamard, and Leon-Kahn; Priests Debierre and Lamand; Guyot and Morveux, members of the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party; General Bertie; representatives of various public organizations; and prominent members of the Socialist Party, the People's Republican Movement, the French People's League, and other bourgeois parties.

    The congress focused on discussing the cessation of current wars, the struggle to defend the national independence and security of all countries, and the peaceful resolution of the German question. Speakers resolutely demanded an immediate end to the criminal colonial war in Indochina, a halt to the war in Korea, and a stop to the policies of war preparation and arms expansion. Speakers paid particular attention to French security, as the rearmament of West Germany under the guise of the "European Army" posed a new threat to France. The congress passed a resolution pointing out the necessity of strengthening the struggle for peace and strengthening the united action of millions of peace fighters. The congress also elected a delegation of thirteen people, composed of scientists, artists, social leaders, and religious representatives, to attend the World People's Peace Congress.

    The French National Farmers' Peace Congress, held in Paris on the 23rd, was attended by 700 representatives from 72 provinces. Roger, member of the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party and member of the National Assembly, delivered a speech at the meeting. He pointed out that the unity of all French patriots, including farmers and agricultural workers, in the struggle to defend peace can stop the policy of war preparation and return France to the path of peaceful economic development. The congress passed a resolution urging all patriots to unite and fight to defend peace, to strive for the implementation of a policy of peaceful and friendly neighborliness among all nations, and to respect the policy of national independence and freedom. The congress decided to establish a national committee of farmers to defend peace and defend French agriculture, and elected the members of the committee. The congress also elected delegates to attend the World People's Peace Congress.

    Xinhua News Agency, 27th dispatch: According to TASS, Berlin: The German Congress for Promoting Mutual Understanding and Defending Peace will be held in Berlin on the 28th and 29th. More than 4,000 peace fighters from the German Democratic Republic and many guests from West Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Britain, Belgium, and other countries will participate in the congress. Renowned German poet Johannes Becher will deliver a keynote report entitled "Things All Germans Agree On." The congress will approve the list of delegates from the German Democratic Republic to attend the World People's Peace Congress.

    Peace committees in West Germany have held peace congresses in order to participate in the "German Congress for Promoting Mutual Understanding and Defending Peace." Local peace committees in Spandau, Charlottenburg, and Tempelhof in West Berlin held peace congresses. A peace congress held in Wilmersdorf, in the British occupation zone, passed a resolution to the President of the Bonn Federal Parliament, welcoming the Federal Parliament's majority vote against the immediate ratification of the Bonn "General Treaty."

    Xinhua News Agency, 27th dispatch: According to TASS, Moscow: The Soviet Peace Support Committee held a plenary meeting on the 26th.
