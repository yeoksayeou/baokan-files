The agenda item regarding the report of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea has turned into the entire Korean question, into the issue of the war imposed on the Korean people and the hope for ending this war. The issue of the ceasefire in Korea and the realization of peace. All peace-loving peoples and the entire progressive humanity are deeply concerned about stopping the Korean War and concluding a ceasefire agreement. The powerful peace movements of many countries are directly linked to the struggle to end the Korean War and resolve the Korean question peacefully.

The delegation of the Polish People's Republic, responding to the resolute demands of hundreds of millions of people who are loudly calling for peace and against war, proposed at the beginning of this session of the United Nations General Assembly, and at the top of its proposals was the Korean question. The Polish delegation, with the support of the Soviet Union and many other delegations, insisted on listing these proposals, including those on the Korean question, as the first item on the agenda and for the First Committee to discuss them first.

This proposal was met with groundless opposition from certain delegations, mainly those of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization led by the United States, and was thus rejected. The issue of the report of the aforementioned United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea was eventually listed as the first item on the agenda, although it was clear from the beginning that this issue could not be considered separately from the entire Korean question, that is, the issue of peace and war in Korea.

Aitchison deliberately fabricates historical facts and distorts the activities of the Soviet-American Joint Commission

On October 24, the First Committee heard a speech by the U.S. Secretary of State. This speech took up almost three hours, but, contrary to what we expected from the agenda, it did not mention the report of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea at all, but focused entirely on the course of the Korean question from the beginning to the present.

Mr. Aitchison, in his speech to the First Committee, set himself the task of broadly examining the entire Korean question, the development of this question, and the role of the United Nations in the Korean affair over the past few years. Mr. Aitchison set himself a difficult and responsible task, which could only be accomplished under certain conditions, but he deliberately ignored these conditions. These conditions are that in narrating the facts, one must have an objective attitude, that is, to provide historical truth, which is incompatible with arbitrary treatment of facts, especially the fabrication of facts.

Mr. Aitchison took a different path; he distorted the facts, deliberately made serious mistakes, and did not hesitate to engage in direct distortion. Now let us look at the facts.

Mr. Aitchison began by talking about the meeting of representatives of the United States, Britain, and China held in Cairo in December 1943, which adopted a declaration concerning the Korean question, which the Soviet Union later endorsed. He traced the meeting of the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain held in Moscow from December 16 to December 26, 1945, at which an agreement was reached on the Korean question. This meeting adopted an important decision on assisting the establishment of a temporary democratic government of Korea, for which purpose a joint commission was established, consisting of representatives of the U.S. military command in South Korea and the Soviet military command in North Korea. The main task of the commission was to draft proposals on assisting the political, economic, and social progress of the Korean people (trusteeship), the establishment of democratic self-government, and the national independence of Korea. In carrying out this work, the joint commission had to invite the participation of the temporary democratic government of Korea and absorb Korean democratic organizations to consult with them. It must be admitted that Mr. Aitchison here, in the First Committee, made every effort to distort the facts concerning the activities of the joint commission and the work of the Moscow meeting.

Mr. Aitchison did not mention at all—for example—such an important matter as assisting the political, economic, and social progress of the Korean people and the establishment of democratic self-government in Korea. However, he spared no effort to make it seem as if the various measures devised by the United States to coordinate the administrative and economic activities of Korea were rejected by the Soviet Union on the pretext of fear of infringing on the absolute sphere of influence of the Soviet Union in North Korea.

There is no need to refute this fabrication now, because the Soviet Union has never said such words.

In fact, the situation was completely different from what Mr. Aitchison said. In fact, the Soviet delegation had declared: trade between North and South Korea should be organized on the basis of an exchange of goods of equal value. The Soviet military command, considering the needs of South Korea, agreed to supply South Korea with the necessary electricity, coal, chemical fertilizers, steel, copper, zinc, lead, various acids, timber, and other items, totaling 89,539,289 yuan.

The Soviet military command planned to obtain for North Korea grain (rice), which accounted for two-thirds of the total value of goods delivered from South Korea, as well as parts and supplies needed for the railways, coal mines, and power industry of North Korea, and so on.

In response to the declaration of the Soviet delegation, the American side presented a list of consumer goods, parts, and miscellaneous items totaling 6 million yuan. Later, this list was expanded, and the total value increased to 10 million yuan.

Therefore, the American proposal did not conform to the understanding of equal exchange that had already been reached between the two sides, but intended to have North Korea give South Korea goods worth 79 million yuan on credit. The American proposal completely excluded the item of grain delivery, although the Soviet delegation had clearly stated: "Whether the U.S. military command exchanges grain to supply the North Korean laborers who need rice to produce goods, the Soviet military command can decide on the exchange of goods."

The United States wanted to create a famine in North Korea, wanted to hinder the policy of the Soviet Union, and therefore refused to transport rice to North Korea. Therefore, the Soviet delegation had to temporarily suspend consideration of the exchange of goods until the "U.S. military command can guarantee that South Korea will transport the parts needed for industry and the grain needed for industrial workers to North Korea, and the total number of exchanges between the two sides is roughly equal."

The Soviet Union has always supported the independence, democracy, and unification of Korea. The United States has consistently carried out divisive and anti-democratic activities.

At the May 6 meeting of the Joint Commission, the Soviet delegation firmly advocated that the current task was not, as proposed by the United States, to establish an economic administrative body in South Korea, but to establish a temporary democratic government of Korea. However, the United States stubbornly ignored this.

Mr. Aitchison, when talking about the issue of trusteeship, did not mention that the original American Bernays draft did not provide for the establishment of a government for the whole of Korea, but only emphasized the need to establish an administrative agency headed by two military commanders in Korea before the implementation of the trusteeship system, which would be responsible for governing Korea.

The Moscow meeting considered that, in accordance with the proposal of the Soviet government, a temporary democratic government of Korea should be established, which pointed out that this was in line with the urgent national demands of the Korean people and could also promote the early elimination of the evil consequences left by Japan's long-term rule over Korea.

The American proposal advocated the establishment of an executive council composed of representatives of the four powers (the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and China), endowed with administrative, legislative, and judicial powers. This American proposal still did not provide for the establishment of a Korean government.

However, the Moscow meeting considered that a temporary Korean government should be established and that a Soviet-American Joint Commission should be established to assist in the completion of this important work. The Soviet government has consistently supported measures aimed at establishing a truly independent, democratic, and unified Korea from the very beginning.

Mr. Aitchison, when talking about the issue of consulting with the Democratic Party, spoke in a mild manner, which was obviously not in line with the facts. Mr. Aitchison merely repeated the views expressed by Marshall, who was then the Secretary of State, on this issue, reducing the whole matter to the question of the definition of the word "democracy," while in fact the question was not about the word, but about more serious differences, which arose because the American representative simply sabotaged the decision of the aforementioned Moscow meeting to consult with the Korean Democratic Party and public organizations.

The American delegation of the Soviet-American Joint Commission tried mainly to include the parties within the Lee Syngman group in these so-called "democratic" parties.

They tried not to include many powerful democratic organizations in South Korea in the true Democratic Party, such as the All-Korean Federation of Trade Unions, the All-Korean Farmers' Federation, the National Revolutionary Party, the Korean Democratic Youth League, and other organizations with millions of members. The American delegation had proposed inviting small organizations that had no prestige at home and only represented the reactionary upper-class clique of South Korea to participate in the consultations.

Mr. Aitchison here erroneously said that the Soviet Union opposed inviting these political organizations or parties that opposed the trusteeship method stipulated by the Moscow Agreement to participate in the consultations.

The Soviet Union had firmly advocated consulting with those Democratic Party organizations and parties that fully supported the Moscow decisions on the Korean question. The Soviet Union firmly advocated that the parties or mass organizations invited to consult with the Joint Commission should not appoint those who had lost their reputation due to their active opposition to the Moscow Agreement as representatives of the consultations.

From a letter from the American commander on December 24, 1946, it can be seen that he had agreed to these proposals, but made some modifications.

Molotov, in a letter to Marshall on May 7, 1947, agreed to these modifications and expressed the hope that there would be no further reasons to delay the meeting of the Soviet-American Joint Commission, because the convening of this meeting was obviously obstructed due to disagreements over the participation of the Korean Democratic Party in the consultations. However, the American side continued to implement its anti-democratic policy—supporting reactionary organizations and obstructing the participation of democratic organizations in the consultations.

The American government not only did not list all the parties and organizations that it did not like but were truly democratic in the list of Democratic Party organizations, but also launched a suppression campaign against the true Democratic Party organizations and leaders in South Korea who supported the Moscow resolutions and the resolutions of the Joint Commission.

Representatives of Democratic Party organizations and leaders were arrested one after another. In 1947, many leading cadres and staff of the Central Committee of the South Korean Democratic National Front and its publishing house, as well as leading cadres of the county and city committees of the South Korean Democratic National Front, were arrested. Also arrested were the chairman and other important members of the All-Korean Federation of Farmers' Unions, members of the All-Korean Federation of Trade Unions, the South Korean Democratic Women's League, the Central Federation of Cooperative Unions, the Writers' Association, the Lawyers' Association, and many other organizations. In addition, leaders of the Labor Party were also arrested.

Naturally, the Soviet delegation of the Joint Commission could not tolerate such a situation and therefore demanded that the American delegation immediately take measures to restore the normal existence and activities of the Democratic Party organizations in South Korea and the appropriate conditions for the work of the Soviet-American Joint Commission.

Molotov, in a letter to Marshall on August 23, 1947, also pointed out this. At that time, he emphasized that this situation was abnormal and unacceptable; it made it impossible to properly implement the decisions of the Moscow meeting of the three foreign ministers on the Korean question unless the persecution of the South Korean democratic organizations and leaders was immediately and completely stopped.

The acting Secretary of State, Mr. Lovett, in his reply to Molotov, did not deny that there were arrests of representatives of Democratic Party organizations in the American occupation zone. He tried to justify these arrests, saying that they were necessary to suppress the so-called sabotage activities aimed at overthrowing the legitimate government and endangering the security of the American occupation zone. In fact, there was no "sabotage activity" at all. The issue was not about anything else, but about suppressing the South Korean democratic movement that was struggling for the true unification of Korea and the establishment of an independent democratic Korean state.

Mr. Aitchison here exaggerated Lovett's letter, portraying this letter as proof of the so-called democratic policy of the United States aimed at promoting the unification of Korea and guaranteeing the independence and democratic system of Korea. In fact, Lovett's letter proved that the American authorities had no intention of helping Korea to establish a truly democratic government. We only need to recall the American proposals on the Korean question. According to Lovett's explanation, the American proposal provided for the establishment of a temporary so-called regional legislative assembly, and according to the American plan, a temporary national legislative assembly, that is, a temporary all-Korean legislative assembly, would be established by the regional legislative assembly. However, such a proposal to establish a temporary legislative assembly in South and North Korea, that is, in the Soviet and American regions, not only could not eliminate the already existing situation of Korea being divided into two regions, but would make the division of Korea permanent, is this not obvious?

The Soviet government firmly adhered to the Moscow meeting's provisions on the democratic unification of Korea and naturally could not accept Lovett's proposal. The Soviet government's rejection of the American proposal of division was used as an excuse to refuse to negotiate further with the Soviet government on the Korean question.

Mr. Aitchison here said that at that time, the United States began to realize that there was no longer any hope for bilateral negotiations with the Soviet Union; he also said that the American side concluded that they had done their utmost to make the problem progress, but had not received a response from the other side. Therefore, the American government brought this issue to the United Nations.

What the United States did and whether its actions—using Mr. Aitchison's words—could make the problem progress, can be seen very clearly from what I said earlier. The answer to this question must be negative. The United States did nothing to make the problem progress, that is, did nothing to ensure the success of the South Korean democratic movement, to achieve the unification and democratization of Korea, to restore its national economy and culture, which were the things being done in North Korea at that time. North Korea had also completed profound democratic reforms, ensuring broad political freedoms and improving the well-being of the people.

At that time, while reactionary forces were rampant in South Korea and people's basic freedoms and rights were suppressed, North Korea held universal elections, promulgated laws on the equality of women and men, established local government bodies and the North Korean People's Committee on the basis of free democratic elections; implemented land reform, giving 725,000 landless peasant households 1.1 million hectares of land that had previously belonged to Japanese colonialists and their Korean lackeys. At the same time, it nationalized the former Japanese industries; promulgated laws on the eight-hour workday, labor insurance, and social insurance; adopted the Korean language in schools, increased the number of schools in various places; implemented public education reforms, and the number of students increased significantly.

At that time, in 1947, the Soviet government had already proposed the following measures:

1. Establish a temporary democratic government of Korea on the basis of the broad participation of Korean Democratic Party organizations and people's organizations to accelerate the political and economic unification of Korea and become an independent state free from foreign interference, thus ending the situation of Korea being divided into two regions.

2. Establish democratic government bodies throughout Korea on the basis of universal equal voting.

3. Assist the Korean people in rebuilding Korea as an independent democratic country and developing their national economy and national culture.

At the same time, the Soviet government proposed that the Soviet-American Joint Commission resume its work on the basis of strictly fulfilling the agreements of the Moscow meeting on Korea; and submit the results of the work on drafting proposals for the establishment of a temporary democratic government of Korea to the Soviet and American governments for consideration no later than July or August 1947.

Before the second session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Soviet delegation participating in the Joint Commission, in order to accelerate the work of establishing a temporary democratic government of Korea, accepted a proposal from the American delegation, that is, not to conduct oral consultations with the Korean Democratic Party organizations and people's organizations—this was the issue that caused disagreements in the commission, and at the same time put forward a new proposal, advocating the establishment of a provisional people's congress of the whole of Korea composed of representatives of all Korean Democratic Party organizations and people's organizations as a consultative body. This proposal was rejected by the American delegation.

When the American government decided to obstruct further cooperation with the Soviet Union on the basis of the decisions of the Moscow meeting to solve the Korean question, when the American government decided to more stubbornly strive to permanently divide Korea and implement its reactionary aggressive plans, the truth was just as described.

This is the real reason for bringing the Korean question to the United Nations General Assembly in violation of the existing international agreements on Korea.

The United States supports the traitor Lee Syngman group to achieve the purpose of exploiting the resources of South Korea

A large part of Mr. Aitchison's speech was an attempt to accuse North Korea and the Soviet Union of carrying out so-called sabotage activities aimed at overthrowing the Lee Syngman government in South Korea. He pointed out that the Soviet Union had paid special attention to training supporters of the Soviet Union among the Koreans, who held important positions in the parties and state organs of North Korea. In his speech, of course, there was the usual anti-Soviet slander of the State Department, saying that the Soviet secret police was active in North Korea, saying that the Soviet Union "ruled" the North Korean government.

It is redundant to explain here how absurd and ridiculous these words are. Mr. Aitchison's reason for speaking so much on this topic is to divert public attention so that they do not pay attention to the anti-democratic activities that the United States is carrying out in South Korea through its puppets among the semi-feudal landlords, who are the most reactionary class in Korea. These semi-feudal landlords were the pillars of Japanese colonial rule and have actively helped the Japanese colonialists enslave Korea and plunder Korea and trample on the Korean people under the protection of Japanese bayonets.

Among these people are brutal Japanese secret agents, such as the notorious "cotton king," the big landlord Kim Seong-joo and Kim Yong-joo, the owner of the airplane company Park Heung-sik, and their cronies, who are representatives of reactionary officials, exchanging their national interests for the right to serve in the colonial apparatus.

Everyone knows that Lee Syngman's entire activities fully and clearly reveal the political character of this stubborn fascist, who was hastily sent back by airplane from the United States as early as October 1945.

Mr. Aitchison here tries to slander some patriots who have dedicated themselves to the welfare of the Korean people and have worked tirelessly to strengthen the friendship and cooperation between Korea and the Soviet Union. These patriots, in the past and in the future, will always receive full gratitude from the Soviet people. The Soviet people will steadfastly maintain friendship with progressive people in other countries who are fighting for legitimate national interests, striving for democratic reforms, and fighting for the freedom and independence of their homeland.

But what do we have to say about Lee Syngman? He was once a minister of the secret royal council of the Korean king, he actively cooperated with the pro-Japanese elements, he was sentenced to life imprisonment as early as 1898, and later was released due to the intervention of the Japanese ambassador to Korea.

Everyone knows that Lee Syngman went to the United States in 1904, returned to Korea in 1910 after Korea was annexed by Japan, and served his Japanese imperialist masters again. Later, he reappeared in the United States, currying favor with his new masters. Between 1920 and 1922, he used his connections to work for Korea to become a U.S. trust territory.

Such a person, of course, was very useful to the U.S. occupation authorities, who knew why they supported Lee Syngman, this old hand of colonial rule, which was a system of oppression of the people and a combination of unprecedented brutality and plunder and barbaric exploitation of the masses.

Lee Syngman is not a unique figure. In the ruling clique of South Korea, there are also such genuine reactionaries like him, such as: Lee Beom-seok, who is also the leader of the Korean Youth Fascist Organization; Foreign Minister Chang Je-yong, who is the former head of the Seoul Police Department and is notorious for his role as a big executioner; Public Works Minister Jeon Jeon-han, who is the leader of the reactionary trade union; Minister of Justice Lee In, who is a former Japanese court official; Interior Minister Yun Ji-yeong, who was an active member of the pro-Japanese organization in Korea.

The U.S. authorities have maintained the closest ties with all these gentlemen—the open and covert traitors and Japanese secret agents—this was reported by the London magazine "New Statesman and Nation" in 1945. With the help of this so-called government, U.S. monopolists began to vigorously exploit the natural resources of South Korea—tungsten, molybdenum, and other strategically important rare metals—thus making huge profits.

At the same time, the living conditions of the farmers and the broad working masses of South Korea have deteriorated to a miserable state. The number of unemployed people continued to increase, reaching two million, even almost three million in some periods. Due to the unbearable burden of rent and various oppressive taxes, the lives of the farmers were miserable. Between 1944 and 1947, the area of cultivated land decreased by 31%, and the production of rice also decreased by approximately the same rate. South Korea, which was once the granary of the country, is now constantly suffering from serious food shortages, and the people have to live in misery and hunger. However, the profits of the colonialists and the income of the landlords continue to increase.

The living conditions of the people of South Korea are deteriorating day by day, like a river flowing downstream. Even the United Nations Commission on Korea could not hide this situation; the commission's report for the first quarter of 1948 pointed out: the factors that continue to destroy the economy of South Korea still exist today. The commission's report for 1949 to 1950 (up to September 4) emphasized: the financial situation of South Korea in 1949 continued to deteriorate. According to the commission, the main reason for the economic deterioration was the addition of a huge extra expenditure to maintain the military and police who were suppressing the people's indignation against the Lee Syngman regime. Not only the Korean people, but also a large part of the people in South Korean society who cooperated with Lee Syngman under the pressure of the U.S. military authorities, hated the Lee Syngman regime. The United Nations Commission also admitted this. The price of the main food—rice—continued to rise, causing general anxiety among the people.

The so-called "economic stabilization" plan that the U.S. authorities wanted to implement in the first half of 1950 in South Korea ended in complete failure. The corruption and greed of the Lee Syngman regime had corrupted the entire government apparatus. The so-called "voluntary donations" method was actually a way for the military and police, and even for some "associations" under the protection of the Lee Syngman government, to extort money from the people, causing so many abuses that even the United Nations Commission had to admit in its report that this method seriously harmed the entire tax system.

Mr. Aitchison found it best to say nothing about these facts, because even the United Nations Commission had pointed out these facts, which would definitely expose the Korean history that Mr. Aitchison, the U.S. Secretary of State, was telling us here as fiction. These facts would inevitably make it impossible for Mr. Aitchison to praise the Lee Syngman regime and more impossible to conceal the disaster that this regime, which developed under the patronage of the U.S. authorities, brought to the people of South Korea. The Lee Syngman fascist regime faces people's resistance

The "report" of the United Nations Commission tries to cover up the facts

If, in addition to the above situation, we point out the shameful and brutal measures taken by the Lee Syngman regime to suppress all democratic aspirations of the people, then the entire political corruption will be clearly laid out in front of everyone, without the need for any special explanation.

Mr. Aitchison was obviously satisfied with the political system of South Korea. Even the United Nations Commission on Korea, this docile tool, tried every means to dilute the horrifying scene, but could not hide the facts that fully exposed the Lee Syngman regime as a brutal reactionary regime, a genuine fascist regime. For example, the report submitted by the United Nations Commission on Korea to the fifth session of the United Nations General Assembly could not deny that during the election campaign in April and May 1950, about 200 people with democratic ideas were arrested on suspicion of being members of or supporting and sympathizing with the South Korean Labor Party, which was banned under the notorious National Security Law approved by the U.S. authorities.

The report of the United Nations Commission on Korea said: "Many supporters of the candidates were threatened and even beaten by police and other unidentified persons, with the intention of intimidating them.... There were many cases of withdrawal from the election, which showed that pressure was used." Some arrests were clearly in violation of Article 117 of the election law.

To illustrate the nature of this United Nations Commission, it should be pointed out that although the commission pointed out serious violations of the election law and infringements of basic democratic rights and freedoms, it finally said that the organization of the election was praiseworthy and that the authorities had not illegally interfered with the election campaign. This is a very strange and difficult thing!

Since then, the situation has not only not changed, but has become worse and more serious.

The report submitted by the United Nations Commission to the seventh session (Report No. A-2187) contains many facts showing that in South Korea, the Lee Syngman government is becoming more and more lawless, and the Lee Syngman government is using all means to persecute everyone suspected of having democratic views.

Even the so-called National Assembly of South Korea began to oppose Lee Syngman!

The report in the Russian version on page 18 says that gradually, many members of the National Assembly were also very dissatisfied with the president's rule of concentrating power, believing that the president was acting arbitrarily and independently, so they began to refuse to support the amendment of the constitution unless they could exercise their electoral rights to elect someone else as president instead of Lee Syngman. A fierce struggle broke out between Lee Syngman and the National Assembly.

In May 1952, Lee Syngman imposed martial law in Busan, and the next day, out of 183 members of the entire National Assembly, more than 50 were arrested, and another part of the members, fearing arrest, all went into hiding. As a result, according to the report of the commission, the National Assembly could not convene due to insufficient quorum. Seeing that the members of the National Assembly did not attend the meetings of the assembly, the police, on the orders of Lee Syngman, forcibly brought the members to the National Assembly, locked them in the conference hall, and forced them to pass the decisions that Lee Syngman wanted to pass.

To summarize the characteristics of the situation in South Korea, one only needs to look at the report of the United Nations Commission on Korea. Although this commission tried to cover up the heinous crimes of the Lee Syngman regime, it exposed the fact that this regime had driven the people of South Korea into such a state of misery. They hated the Lee Syngman clique and their masters so much. To get an idea of this, one only needs to look at the part of the United Nations Commission report that talks about the mass executions that took place in Hongjari (phonetic transcription) and Juchang (phonetic transcription) in December 1950. From the official reports of the South Korean authorities themselves, it can be seen that between October 1 and December 15, 1950, 391 people were sentenced to death for suspected dissatisfaction with the Lee Syngman government and sympathy for the guerrillas. From this report, it can be seen that among those executed were young men and women.

Given the above situation, we cannot but mention the shameful behavior of this commission called the United Nations Commission. This commission, after seeing the brutal executions and mass killings carried out by the Lee Syngman government, actually called the decision of the Lee Syngman government to execute people individually in the future rather than in batches a "humane act"!

In this regard, it will not be superfluous to point out that this report was submitted by a commission composed of representatives from Australia, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Thailand, Turkey, the Philippines, and Chile.

The report said that in the village of Sinwonmyeon (phonetic transcription) near Juchang in southeastern Korea, many residents were accused of cooperating with the guerrillas and aiding the guerrillas in 1951, and were executed according to the judgment of the military court. According to the report, the incident began in June 1950, when the South Korean police tried to destroy the village several times but failed. Until February 1951, a battalion of the South Korean army and a police detachment attacked the village, but encountered resistance from hundreds of well-armed guerrillas, who were supported by 500 unarmed guerrillas and villagers. The battle lasted ten hours. The report said that the villagers assisted the guerrillas. They prepared hiding places for the guerrillas in the granaries and houses.

The report also said that the villagers and communists had officially united. During the battle, the villagers refused the police's request for food but gave food to the guerrillas, showing their sympathy. The report said that all these facts undoubtedly showed that the villagers cooperated with the communist guerrillas, which was a major obstacle to the military activities of the army. The military and police were angered by the attitude of the local villagers and continued to attack, killing about 200 communists, including villagers who had cooperated with the guerrillas.

The commander of the South Korean expeditionary force and the chief of the Juchang (Kuhchan, phonetic transcription) police detective squad were not satisfied with this savage suppression and further executed 187 residents of Shinwuk Village (phonetic transcription).

Unarmed farmers in Juchang fought so bravely against the Lee Syngman police who attempted to massacre hundreds of guerrillas, and the Lee Syngman police admitted that the villagers cooperated with the guerrillas and had deep affection for them, which vividly proves that the struggle against the Lee Syngman regime in South Korea has deep roots among the broad masses of the people.

The guerrilla movement in South Korea is the result of the widespread resistance of the masses of the people in South Korea against the Lee Syngman regime and the U.S. military authorities who support this regime.

The fascist Lee Syngman regime, relying on the support of its powerful foreign masters, has been extremely cruel in persecuting anyone with even the slightest progressive democratic ideas. The report of the United Nations Commission admits that some people were tortured after being arrested, and Korean citizens were often arrested just for daring to criticize Americans.

Is it surprising that such a situation caused widespread dissatisfaction among the people and the development of the guerrilla movement in South Korea? This must be a serious obstacle to the preparations for the invasion of North Korea.

Mr. Aitchison said that the purpose of the activities of the North Korean Communist Party was to sabotage the South Korean government. In fact, nothing could destroy the prestige of the South Korean government like the open, barbaric, and inhuman reactionary policies that the South Korean government has implemented.

Under the direction and support of the United States, the Lee Syngman gang instigated the criminal war

Mr. Aitchison, in attacking the North Korean government, actually said that the proposal for the peaceful unification of Korea made by the North Koreans was an act of aggression....

A person can only see an aggressive plot in a peace proposal in a state of extreme mental disorder!

But let's analyze it, why does Mr. Aitchison not care at all about the diametrically opposite, openly war-mongering speeches of Lee Syngman and other South Korean political leaders? Let's see what these gentlemen said before they launched their attack on North Korea. In this regard, the report submitted by the commission to the fifth session of the United Nations in 1949 said: "However, the commission often noted the speeches of the president, the foreign minister, and other important and influential political figures, which indicated that time was running out and that the last resort, the use of force to unify, might be taken if necessary." For example, at the first anniversary of the United Nations' recognition of the government of the Republic of Korea, the foreign minister expressed the "hope that the people would make every effort to eliminate the 38th parallel so that the unification of the whole of Korea could be completed by December 12 of the following year. In view of this, the people should make a firm decision from now on to prepare for bloodshed." President Lee Syngman similarly said at a press conference on December 30, 1949: "We must complete unification next year, and I believe we can do it.... In order to cooperate with the United Nations, we have been sincerely maintaining a patient attitude. We will continue to strive for mutual understanding among the Korean people to achieve reunification. However, when the inevitable time comes, we may not be able to avoid bloodshed and civil war. If unfortunately we cannot achieve unification this year, then we will have to unify our territory by ourselves."

In February 1950, South Korean Defense Minister Shin Sung-mo openly said: "If the United Nations cannot pull out the 'dagger' from Korea, which it has never done, then the Korean people must do so with their own efforts and strength."

If Mr. Aitchison has not had time to study the report of the Korean Commission correctly, then perhaps he can spend a few hours looking at these words now. Think about what these words mean. This can also help him understand how the incident of June 25, 1950 happened and why it happened.

Mr. Aitchison spent a part of his speech trying to prove that the aggression within Korea was prepared and carried out by North Korea. Mr. Aitchison made it seem as if this action was taken a few weeks after the South Korean government had crushed what Mr. Aitchison called the communist invasion from the north, after it had suppressed a domestic rebellion, and after what Mr. Aitchison called the wise policy of the Lee Syngman government had foiled all the plots of the North Koreans. Mr. Aitchison knows exactly how many young North Koreans were trained in Siberia, how the Korean Workers' Party carried out what he called the purge in the summer of 1949 and secretly swallowed up the South Korean Workers' Party; he knows how North Korea—I am quoting Mr. Aitchison—organized a powerful army, how this army was educated, trained, and well-equipped, and how the Soviet government provided it with strategic and tactical advice; finally, he also knows how all the civilians in North Korea received basic military training. Mr. Aitchison knew all these things in detail from defectors from North Korea and United Nations personnel working in North Korea—Mr. Aitchison himself admitted this.

But what military measures did South Korea take during this period? Mr. Aitchison knew nothing about this, only knowing that the South Korean army was completely unprepared for attack, only stationed for defense. However, this statement is completely different from the information that is more reliable and true than that obtained from defectors, the information reported by those familiar with this issue. I want to quote a statement made by Johnson, the director of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration's Korean branch, to prove this. Johnson said in the U.S. House of Representatives Appropriations Committee on May 19, 1950: The 100,000 South Korean soldiers equipped with American weapons and trained by American officers under the guidance of the U.S. Military Advisory Group in Seoul have completed their preparations and can start the war at any time.

This statement contradicts Mr. Aitchison's statement that the 100,000 South Korean soldiers were not armed for attack.

Mr. Aitchison added some documents to his so-called evidence of North Korean "aggression," including the so-called plan to attack South Korea that fell into the hands of the United Nations forces, which is said to be preserved by the United Nations now. This is worth discussing in detail.

All armed clashes in the 38th parallel area were instigated by South Korea. Before June 1949, most of these incidents were cases of shooting into North Korean territory. From June onwards, the South Korean army began to violate the 38th parallel, crossing it with entire units to occupy North Korean positions, which led to armed clashes.

From June to August 1949, the main areas invaded by South Korea were Ongjin, Kaesong, and Sangnyong.

In the Ongjin area, the South Korean police repeatedly violated the 38th parallel and often occupied North Korean highlands.

In June 1949, the South Korean army mobilized seven infantry battalions equipped with mortars and one artillery battalion to launch an attack, aiming to occupy advantageous positions in North Korea. This battle lasted for two months, with only short interruptions.

On June 27, a battalion of the South Korean army occupied the 288.0-meter high ground; on July 19, the South Korean army occupied the 112.0, 131.7, and 123.0-meter high grounds (the farthest reaching 1 kilometer north of the 38th parallel).

On August 4, North Korea recaptured its positions and drove the enemy out of North Korean territory.

In the Kaesong area, the war was fought from July 22 to August 1, 1949. On July 25, a battalion of the South Korean army, after heavy shelling, attacked and occupied the 488.2-meter high ground north of the 38th parallel. The battle lasted from July 28 to August 1, 1949, resulting in the South Korean forces being driven out of North Korean territory.

The South Korean army used a large number of cannons and mortars in the process of launching the offensive in the Kaesong area. On July 28, the South Korean army fired more than 3,500 howitzer shells and more than 1,000 mortar shells.

In addition, South Korea also violated the 38th parallel in other places, such as the Shanyang area on the east coast. On July 28, South Korea sent two sabotage teams totaling 156 people across the 38th parallel in this area to cut off the retreat of the North Korean army in the Yongsan and Shanyang areas; on July 5 and 6, the South Korean army, about one infantry battalion, occupied Indeok (phonetic transcription) and Gongsu-ri, entering 4.5 kilometers north of the 38th parallel; the South Korean army, about one battalion, occupied the highlands in the area of Jisudong-ri (1 kilometer north of the 38th parallel). I would like to remind you that the issue of aggression against Korea was raised as early as the fifth session in 1950, when the U.S. delegation tried to deny the U.S. aggression against Korea with the participation of the Lee Syngman government.

Even at that time, this attempt had completely failed. The evidence presented by the Soviet delegation exposed the U.S. plot to accuse the North Korean government of aggression to cover up its own aggressive actions. We had already pointed out at that time that the Lee Syngman government and its American friends were preparing to attack North Korea and presented irrefutable evidence that cannot be denied to this day. Lee Syngman played an important role in this preparation, which can be clearly seen from a letter he wrote to Professor Oliver of the United States on September 30, 1949. I quoted his letter at that time. Professor Oliver confirmed that he had received such a letter, in which Lee Syngman said: "Now (referring to September 1949) is the most psychologically advantageous time to take aggressive steps and unite the loyal part of the North Korean army to annihilate the rest."

Lee Syngman told Professor Oliver in the letter that "we will drive part of Kim Il-sung's men into the mountains to starve to death there."

He told Dr. Oliver that Oliver and his friends should work quietly in Washington and New York, while Lee Syngman himself would work in Seoul and Tokyo for the same goal—to "cleanse the country and clean up our house."

South Korean Ambassador to the United States Cho Byung-yul also made many efforts in this regard, writing to Lee Syngman in October 1949 that he had read Lee Syngman's letter to Oliver about "eliminating the North Korean puppet regime" with great interest and enthusiasm.

Cho Byung-yul wrote: "I have discussed this issue with Ambassador Chang and Professor Oliver, and we have reached the unanimous conclusion that this plan must be the basic plan of our government and must be implemented when we are fully prepared and the right time comes."

Cho Byung-yul pointed out in a letter to Lee Syngman in November 1949 that unification of Korea could only be achieved through the sovereignty of the government, and said that the most important task of the Lee Syngman government was to strengthen the military and economic preparations of South Korea.

Lee Syngman publicly declared in December 1949 that he had the determination to recover lost territory in the new year (i.e., 1950). He also publicly warned that the South Koreans would not implement a policy of peace in the future, and he instructed the South Koreans to remember: due to changes in the international situation in the new year, they (referring to the Lee Syngman faction) would have to unify South and North Korea with "our own efforts."

Of course, this is very clear: if it were not for the support of the U.S. ruling class for their aggressive intentions, Lee Syngman and his henchmen would not dare to openly speak of their plans to attack North Korea.

During this period, U.S. Secretary of Defense Johnson, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Bradley, and State Department advisor Dulles arrived in East Asia and held a secret meeting with General MacArthur. Everyone knows that Dulles visited South Korea ten days before the South Korean armed forces launched their attack on North Korea on June 25 to inspect the designated front line and trenches. Dulles delivered a speech in the South Korean National Assembly on June 19, agreeing to the plan of the Lee Syngman government to launch a military adventure against North Korea, saying that the United States would provide South Korea with all necessary moral and material support to fight communism.

Dulles, on June 20, 1950, five days before the attack on North Korea, wrote a letter to Lee Syngman saying that he highly valued the role that Lee Syngman's country would play in the great drama that was about to unfold.

So far, we have not heard Dulles explain the meaning of this sentence. At that time, we pointed out Dulles' statement and seriously accused it of provoking the Korean War. This accusation has not been refuted to this day.

At that time, Mr. Aitchison did not speak about this matter, but he has now decided to speak, which is obviously to save face in front of the representatives of the voters. However, by doing so, he has allowed us to discuss all these important issues regarding the report of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea; to examine these issues, which can reveal the truth of the Korean incident. As early as January 1950, General Roberts had issued an order to the officials of the Lee Syngman government that the plan to attack North Korea had been decided. Roberts warned that although South Korea could start the attack itself, it still had to create a pretext to have a legitimate reason. He also said that the United Nations Commission could timely submit a report to the United Nations that was in line with this situation. At that time, the plan to attack North Korea had already been prepared.

There are also many equally important pieces of evidence showing that the Lee Syngman army had prepared to attack North Korea. The most important of these materials is a strategic map found in the secret archives of the Lee Syngman government, which is now in the hands of the North Korean government.

At the fifth session, I had explained in detail the contents of this map, on which the South Korean army launched attacks from the Yellow Sea coast to the Gohwangpo area and from the Gohwangpo area to the east coast area. The main directions of the attack were marked on the map. The route of the navy landing in Hancheon to attack Pyongyang was also marked on the map, as well as the directions of the attack from Dongducheon, Chuncheon, Hansung, and other places.

These are irrefutable facts and are irrefutable evidence that the South Korean army, under the guidance of the United States, had planned and organized an attack on North Korea, which was prepared and supported by the U.S. armed forces.

The illegal decision of the Security Council in 1950 was a trick by the United States to cover up its aggressive crimes

All the words Mr. Aitchison said here about the North Korean attack are not worth any consideration. The irrefutable facts of South Korea's aggression have not been proven to be untrue in any way: the State Department has not presented any evidence to support its own statements. The only thing the gentlemen of the State Department could do was to use clichés and make meaningless insults. They seemed to think they had no responsibility to provide any evidence. They mechanically repeated that North Korea launched an aggression, they quoted the resolution of the Security Council on June 25, which arbitrarily stated that the North Korean army attacked South Korea. The source of this resolution is worth further detailed study.

Indeed, on what basis did the Security Council adopt this resolution? What was the truth of the events that took place on June 25? How much confidence could the Security Council members have in the truthfulness of the facts that they used as the basis for their resolution?

Everyone knows that the first source of information about the conflict at the border between North and South Korea that the Security Council received was the South Korean government, which accused the North Korean armed forces of attacking several places in the Ongjin Peninsula and landing north and south of Jangni (phonetic transcription) and advancing towards Seoul.

It is worth noting that at the meeting on June 25, Lie reported this matter in the spirit of the report he received from the Lee Syngman government and the information he obtained from other sources in Korea. He insisted that this report and information clearly proved that the conflict was instigated by the North Korean army. The telegram sent by the United Nations Commission on Korea to the Secretariat on June 25, 1950, included only the aforementioned report of the Lee Syngman government, which was hostile to the North Korean government. At that time, the United Nations Commission on Korea itself had no information about the situation at the border between North and South Korea, and all the information it had was provided in the telegram of the Korean government submitted by U.S. Representative Gross and the information he obtained from U.S. Ambassador to Korea Mucius, who also obtained the information from Lee Syngman.

In addition, the observers of the commission, after patrolling along the border, returned to Seoul on June 23, 1950, and reported the trip at the commission meeting, which was held in Seoul on June 26, 1950. The commission sent a telegram to the United Nations only after this.

From the report of the commission, it can be seen that the information about the events on the 38th parallel that the commission obtained came from the South Korean Minister of the Interior and U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Mucius. It was this Mucius who, in the second half of July 1949, held a meeting with General Roberts and South Korean officials Shin Sung-mo, Kwon Seong-ryul, and Kim Hyo-sik, and told them that large-scale preparations must be made in July and August to attack the north. As for the observers of the commission, when the incident occurred, they were not at the 38th parallel, and the situation at the 38th parallel that they reported could only be traced back to the last day they stayed in the 38th parallel area, June 22, three days before the hostile actions began.

It is no wonder that a representative of the Security Council at that time pointed out that the information obtained was contradictory and not clear enough, and therefore it was not possible to take any unilateral action before hearing the statement of the North Korean government. This representative was known for his hostile attitude towards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, but he still had to explain the past and present facts.

These facts are sufficient to prove beyond doubt that the Security Council had not obtained objective information from a fair source about the events that took place in Korea at dawn on June 25, 1950, and therefore the Security Council had no right to assert that the North Korean army first invaded South Korea, and had no right to take a decision in this regard. However, under the pressure of others, mainly the United States, the Security Council immediately took a decision, and now some people are trying to portray this decision as a decision that can truly answer the question of how the aggression in Korea began and who the real aggressor was.

But the truth will eventually come to light. Now, more and more resolute and louder voices are clearly exposing that the decision of the Security Council on June 25, 1950, was incorrect; more and more questions are being raised, demanding answers, and without answering these questions, you can no longer hope to deceive public opinion peacefully.

In the face of these facts, Mr. Aitchison's fairytale-like rhetoric about the judgment announced by the United Nations Commission—which was as fair at that time as it is today—becomes extremely absurd. But are these words sincere? Aitchison said: this is a fair judgment. But is there a fair judgment without adequate reasons? Is there a fair judgment that does not listen to the defendant's statement or explanation and declares the defendant guilty? This is your so-called fair judgment!

The word judgment represents the opinion of a judge and an upright person responsible for deciding legal cases. Such a profanation and misuse of this noble word—judgment—is unacceptable. The judgment announced by the United Nations Commission or the Security Council cannot be called a fair judgment, because to announce a truly fair judgment, a faithful and objective investigation must be conducted, and without a faithful and objective investigation, no judgment can be considered fair, no matter how loudly the legal professionals shout. Every event that occurred in the Security Council on June 25, June 27, and July 7 was a farce directed by the United States. The United States has been obstructing the peaceful unification of Korea for many years, systematically encouraging the warlike plans of the Lee Syngman government and Lee Syngman himself, preparing a bloody outcome for Korea.

After the Security Council took a decision in an illegal composition on June 25, everything followed a single direction—"North Korea started the aggression," "North Korea started the aggression," "North Korea started the aggression".... But what are the facts? The Security Council had no facts. The Security Council took a decision based on a telegram from the South Korean government that distorted the facts. But we are confident that one day the secret of South Korea's aggression against North Korea will be completely exposed, more thoroughly than it can be exposed today. This secret is already called a humorous secret today, and in fact, it has long become an open secret.

From these facts, it is clear that Mr. Aitchison's attempt to return to the question of the aggression in Korea two and a half years later must be firmly opposed and considered an attempt with no chance of success.

The Korean War did not happen by chance. The Korean War was needed by American capitalists. American capitalists, with a heart full of fear at the signs of the impending economic crisis, placed great hope in a relatively fresh stimulus to prop up the faltering U.S. economy. This stimulus took the form of the Korean War. This war brought terror and death to millions of people, but it brought a continuous stream of war orders and huge profits to the merchants of death.

The organizers and instigators of the Korean intervention have admitted more than once that if the war had not broken out in Korea, it would have broken out somewhere else.

The commander of the United Nations forces, General Van Fleet, once told a visiting delegation from the Philippines: "Some form of the Korean War was bound to happen, whether it happened there or somewhere else on the earth."

This is the root of the Korean War, this is its origin, this is the fact that the beautiful words of lawyers and attorneys cannot eliminate.

The Korean and Chinese sides overcome the unreasonable obstacles of the U.S. side and promote the agreement on the draft ceasefire agreement

Aitchison insisted: the only goal of the U.S. military command in the ceasefire negotiations was to obtain the maximum guarantee to prevent the recurrence of aggression. However, the actual attitude of the U.S. military command in these negotiations was completely the opposite.

The facts are as follows:

1. For example, Aitchison once said: to achieve this goal, it was necessary to prevent the increase of troops during the rotation of personnel. This proposal was not opposed by the Korean and Chinese command, but the latter put forward a completely reasonable demand, that is, to provide conditions to prevent abuse in this matter, to prevent the possibility of the other side increasing the armed forces under the pretext of rotating personnel. It was precisely for this reason that the Korean and Chinese sides proposed the demand that the number of personnel to be rotated should not exceed 5,000, while the U.S. military command insisted on not exceeding 75,000. The U.S. military command insisted on this demand so much that, to avoid a deadlock on this issue, the Korean and Chinese command agreed to increase the number of personnel to be rotated by each side to 35,000. Thus, the Korean side made a great concession.

2. The U.S. military command insisted on the right to monitor events in the rear of the Korean and Chinese sides with the help of a so-called fair commission. Although it was through the so-called fair commission, this was obviously an interference in the internal affairs of North Korea and could not be considered a guarantee to prevent possible aggression, on the contrary, it could only provoke new events and lead to various military consequences.

3. The U.S. military command argued for a long time on the demarcation line, trying to make the demarcation line extend in a direction strategically most favorable to the United States and trying to maintain the areas they had previously occupied. The U.S. military command put forward an absurd demand: when demarcating the line, a large part of North Korean territory should be handed over to them, and they hypocritically said that the "United Nations forces delegation" insisted on its proposal, not because it was interested in expanding the territory under the control of the "United Nations forces," but because the "United Nations forces command" had to obtain a convenient defensive line that the 38th parallel area lacked. If this demand were accepted, 13,000 square kilometers of land, that is, one-twentieth of the entire Korean territory, would be under the control of the U.S. military command.

They insisted on expanding the demarcation line to 8 kilometers north of the 38th parallel, especially specifying that it should be demarcated north of Kaesong on the east coast of Korea. As for the southern part of the Ongjin Peninsula, they were willing to cede it to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea; the U.S. negotiator Hodge said that this place could be given to anyone and it did not matter to them, whether it was given to Abyssinia or Australia.

4. The U.S. military command demanded that North Korea cede a certain part of its territory as compensation in the matter of agreeing to the cessation of sea and air hostilities.

All these American demands clearly show the true purpose of the U.S. military command's prolonged dispute over the demarcation line issue, and also show why this dispute lasted for nearly a month.

Aitchison was silent about the deliberate military provocations carried out by the South Korean and U.S. military in the Kaesong neutral zone, including shooting at cars carrying the Korean and Chinese representatives with white flags, machine-gunning the Kaesong border post of the neutral zone, U.S. planes dropping oil drums and bombs on the areas where the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army representatives resided, and shelling the conference area. In just eight days (August 23 to 30, 1951), U.S. planes violated the airspace of the Kaesong neutral zone 12 times, and on September 1, they even dropped bombs near General Nam Il's residence. In the first week of September, U.S. planes had invaded the airspace of the Kaesong neutral zone more than 100 times, shooting at the conference area. Under such circumstances, it took good self-control to remain calm and express a willingness to reach an agreement on the various issues that the U.S. military command deliberately worsened.

Despite this, the Korean and Chinese sides were finally able to remove many pretexts that obstructed the ceasefire negotiations from reaching an agreement. Due to the flexible, peaceful, and sincere approach of the Korean and Chinese sides, more than 60 items of the ceasefire agreement draft were agreed upon.

The U.S. side proposed an absurd "voluntary repatriation" proposal, causing the prisoner of war issue to become increasingly acute.

Title: The Important Issue of Prisoner Exchange Has Not Yet Been Resolved
Author:
Date: 1952-10-30
Page: 1

Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 30th.

However, there is still a major issue that has not been agreed upon, and this issue has indeed become very acute. This issue is the problem of prisoner exchange. This issue is extremely important and deserves careful consideration, especially since the American delegation is attempting, as it has done many times before, to present the unacceptable stance of the American military command, which violates the basic principles of international law, as the opinion of the United Nations at this conference.

The prisoner issue is not something that, as Mr. Acheson claims here, was completely unexpected by the United States. In fact, this issue was included in the agenda of the ceasefire negotiations from the very beginning.

I do not intend to provide a detailed explanation; I will only discuss a few of the most important stages of the prisoner exchange negotiations.

On December 12, 1951, the Korean and Chinese sides proposed the following regarding this issue:

Both sides should release all prisoners currently in custody; after the signing of the ceasefire agreement, both sides should release and repatriate all prisoners they have in custody in the shortest possible time, in batches, and establish the principle that seriously injured and seriously ill prisoners should be released and repatriated first in the first batch; under the ceasefire committee, both sides should send an equal number of personnel to form a repatriation committee; once the above items are agreed upon and confirmed by both sides, the exchange of the complete list of all current prisoners should be carried out immediately.

The American side not only did not respond to the contents of these proposals but also, in the form of an ultimatum, demanded that the Korean and Chinese sides provide information about prisoners and allow so-called representatives of the International Red Cross to visit the prisoner camps, effectively rejecting any discussion of the Korean and Chinese proposals before such information is provided.

The Korean and Chinese sides provided the necessary information about 11,559 prisoners, while the American delegation provided a list of 132,474 Korean and Chinese prisoners. However, the American side had previously provided the International Red Cross with a list of 176,670 prisoners.

Acheson said that 37,000 people were released after being "reclassified" because they were found not to be prisoners but civilians.

As a result, the American military command used the same method to "reclassify" another 11,000 people.

The Korean and Chinese sides demanded that the American delegation explain the whereabouts of the 1,456 prisoners who were previously included in the total number of prisoners on December 18 but were not listed in the subsequent lists, as well as the 44,205 prisoners who were included in the list provided by the United States through the International Red Cross but were not mentioned in the list on December 18, 1950. The American side said that the materials regarding these 44,000 prisoners were outdated, and these prisoners had been released. However, the American side later had to admit that these people were in American prisoner camps but insisted that they were civilians who had been forcibly conscripted into the Korean army and were local people from South Korea, so they were not included in the list provided on December 18.

On December 31, 1951, the American delegation agreed to provide all materials regarding prisoners by no later than January 2, and on January 3, it reiterated its guarantee. However, it ultimately did not provide any materials.

On January 12, the American side said that there was no need to provide materials regarding prisoners before a ceasefire agreement was reached; on January 15, the American side declared that it would provide basic materials to exchange for supplementary materials from the Korean and Chinese sides regarding South Korean prisoners. However, on January 18, it said that these materials were not basic materials and would not include information about the 44,205 prisoners.

Finally, on January 28, 1952, the American side provided the information, but it only mentioned 132,474 prisoners.

Now, Mr. Acheson claims that there are only 121,000 Korean prisoners in the American prisoner camps. We must not overlook the fact that the Ridgway headquarters admitted on December 31, 1951, that out of the 140,000 prisoners captured at the beginning of the war, about 7,000 had died in American prisoner camps.

All of this, of course, can only have the most unfavorable impact on the progress of the negotiations.

In addition, some of the demands and proposals made by the American side also had a negative impact. For example, the American side once demanded the exchange of prisoners on a one-to-one basis and proposed that the so-called International Red Cross should be responsible for determining whether prisoners who wish to be repatriated are doing so under coercion.

This is utterly absurd! People themselves say they want to be repatriated, but suddenly a special committee appears to determine whether they truly want to be repatriated or are doing so under coercion. Another proposal by the American military command is of the same nature. They proposed that all Korean prisoners who were civilians in South or North Korea before June 25, 1950, should be considered civilians. If this proposal were accepted, then more than 60,000 Korean prisoners would be included in the civilian list.

It can be said that this is the cunning trick behind all these illegal proposals!

The Korean and Chinese sides naturally firmly rejected the American side's illegal demands. The intention of these demands is clearly to detain 165,000 prisoners—soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers—as well as tens of thousands of civilians forcibly relocated from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, with the obvious purpose of handing these prisoners over to Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee to deal with.

Later, both sides decided to submit the prisoner issue to the staff of both sides for discussion. When they began their work, the American side again proposed the so-called voluntary repatriation. After that, the American side continued to insist on this demand, and from subsequent facts, it can be seen that this demand has become a tool for the American delegation to continue to exert pressure to achieve a goal that is completely opposite to that of reaching a ceasefire agreement.

On March 21, the Korean and Chinese sides made another effort to reach an agreement on the prisoner issue. They proposed that after the signing of the ceasefire agreement, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers would release all 11,559 prisoners they were holding and repatriate them, while the American side should release and repatriate all 132,474 prisoners they were holding. The lists of prisoners from both sides would be finally corrected by the staff of both sides. The American delegation stated on March 25 that the Korean and Chinese proposal could become the basis for solving this problem with some modifications. The hope for a successful end to the ceasefire negotiations once again appeared.

Since the American side agreed in principle, the Korean and Chinese delegation proposed specific measures, stipulating that any non-Korean prisoners held by either side and Korean prisoners whose residences are not in the territory controlled by the detaining side must all be repatriated, but Korean prisoners whose residences are in the territory controlled by the detaining side, if they wish to return home to live in peace, do not need to be repatriated.

July, August, and September of 1952 were all spent discussing the prisoner issue; both sides reached an agreement on the draft ceasefire agreement's Articles 51 and 52 on July 4.

Everyone knows that Article 51 stipulates that upon the effective date of the ceasefire agreement, both sides should release and repatriate all prisoners they have in custody as soon as possible, with the release of prisoners based on the lists exchanged by both sides in this article, which should be corrected by both sides before the signing of the ceasefire agreement. Article 52 stipulates that all prisoners must not participate in military actions again and must engage in peaceful occupations.

Later, the American delegation said that they only agreed to repatriate 83,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners, indicating that they intended to detain a large number of captured Koreans and Chinese. The Korean and Chinese delegation then said that this proposal violated the principles agreed upon in the draft ceasefire agreement's Articles 51 and 52, and thus rejected the American proposal. The American representative then said that their proposal was firm and unchangeable and refused to discuss the content of this issue.

It is worth noting that the American delegation proposed Article 52 on February 5, 1952, in the following manner: Both sides should release all prisoners they have in custody as soon as possible after the current ceasefire agreement takes effect. Prisoners released in this manner should be sent or handed over to the other side, but they should not be forcibly repatriated or forcibly handed over. To achieve the shameful goal of forced detention, the American military authorities continued to kill captured Korean and Chinese personnel.

Subsequent developments proved that the American military command had indeed taken measures to forcibly detain prisoners. The American military command spent many months in various prisoner camps implementing a set of methods to intimidate prisoners, making them refuse repatriation. The American military command appointed agents of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek to hold important positions in these prisoner camps, and under the orders of the American military command, they carried out various atrocities in these prisoner camps. Regarding this matter, it must be mentioned that captured Koreans and Chinese had been branded on their bodies and forced to write with their own blood. Those who refused to do so were either beaten or killed.

All these atrocities were to force the tortured and tortured prisoners to express their refusal to return home.

At the same time, during the negotiations, American representatives continued to insist on re-interrogating and screening prisoners.

The mere arrangement of such re-interrogation shows that the original interrogations were fabricated and could not gain the trust of anyone. Otherwise, why would there be a need for re-interrogation? No matter what methods or procedures these re-interrogations take, the fact of arranging re-interrogation is a blatant violation and mockery of the basic principles of international law.

We can cite many irrefutable facts to prove that the Korean and Chinese prisoners held by the United States have been treated inhumanely; independent and free newspapers have reported these facts, and even the Americans themselves and the so-called International Red Cross they boast about have confirmed these facts. Let me just mention a few of these facts.

The bloody atrocities that occurred in February and March 1952 on the island of Koje clearly exposed the unbearable rule in American prisoner camps. The report of the International Red Cross contains information provided by Colonel Fitzgerald, the commander of the Koje prisoner camp, regarding the incident on February 18. This is how Colonel Fitzgerald described the incident on February 18:

After receiving instructions from headquarters to have prisoners and detained civilians personally indicate through a secret ballot whether they wish to be re-screened, the prisoners in Camp 62 refused to carry out this procedure. In this situation, the camp authorities thoroughly discussed the matter and decided to use the military to divide the prisoners into groups. Fitzgerald said: A plan to achieve this purpose was drafted, approved, and implemented.

What does this mean? They wanted to ask people whether they wanted to be repatriated.

To conduct such an interrogation, they divided the prisoners into groups. Of course, it is obvious that this is a method often used by the police, whose purpose is to disperse a group of people who are united into isolated individuals, making it easier to deal with troublemakers and easier to force them to agree not to return home. This fact alone is sufficient to fully illustrate that all these actions were to force prisoners to agree under the threat of guns and machine guns. This is what Colonel Fitzgerald admitted.

The situation was like this. Under these circumstances, can we agree that these shameful measures have the humanitarian purpose that Mr. Acheson is boasting about here? Can we agree with Mr. Acheson's claim that these measures are to protect prisoners from the tyranny and revenge of their leaders? Killing prisoners to protect them is Acheson's formula.

Here are some other things Fitzgerald said. He said: Guards were posted in the camp, and the prisoners were divided into groups. Everything went smoothly, but later many communist agitators in Camp 1 incited the prisoners to attack United Nations soldiers.

All the prisoners were armed with iron bars, clubs, and makeshift weapons made of barbed wire. Large stones and homemade grenades began to be thrown at the soldiers. The military was thus forced to take decisive self-defense measures to repel the attack.

During the entire demonstration, communist flags flew, and all the facts showed that the purpose of the attack was to drive out the United Nations forces.

Fitzgerald said that he was not present when the prisoners carried out the attack because after the first part of the plan was completed, he left the camp.

When he returned to the camp, he learned of the incident, conducted an investigation, and concluded that the task could not be completed at that time. Therefore, he ordered the military to withdraw to avoid further bloodshed.

First of all, it is noteworthy that Colonel Fitzgerald himself was not an eyewitness to these events, and he called these events the "prisoners' attack" instead of correctly calling them the American military's attack on unarmed prisoners. Therefore, the only thing true in his speech is that Acheson likes to call the so-called "interrogation" the "screening" conducted under the threat of American weapons, and before the "screening," the prisoners had already been forcibly divided into groups because it was easier to deal with them in this way.

There is a striking contradiction between Fitzgerald's statement and the information provided by the so-called representatives of the International Red Cross, and according to the report of the Red Cross, the representatives provided first-hand information.

The report of the International Red Cross says: At around 4 AM on February 18, a fully armed military regiment, without any warning, entered the camp.

At that time, except for a few prisoners on guard duty in the tents, most of the prisoners were already asleep. The military surrounded the other tents, including the tent where the prisoner representatives who had not yet been able to contact the camp authorities were staying.

The prisoners were forced to stay in their tents at bayonet point. A few of them, who did not know what was happening at the time, tried to leave the tents and were shot at.

The prisoners panicked, thinking they would all be killed, and tried to escape the tents to defend themselves and find out what was happening. The military immediately opened fire on them.

This was the actual situation, not like what Colonel Fitzgerald said in defense of his executioners.

The report of the International Red Cross also says: At dawn, the prisoner representatives again tried to negotiate with the military commander but failed. This representative also tried to calm the prisoners but also failed. One of his colleagues, the leader of the third prisoner camp, assisted him in trying to contact the commander, but he was killed. It was about 8 AM at this time, and Colonel Fitzgerald arrived at the scene of the incident. In his presence, a few prisoners singing the national anthem were shot.

This was the situation of the massacre. The prisoner representative and his assistant, the leader of the third camp, did their best to prevent this massacre, but their efforts failed. The leader of the third camp was killed, and the prisoners singing the national anthem were shot.

The report of the International Red Cross says: After killing a few more prisoners, the camp commander ordered the prisoners to sit down, and the bodies of the killed prisoners lay in front of them on the ground.

The report continues: Colonel Fitzgerald had said several times that he would withdraw the military, but he did not do so. Then, the prisoner representative requested that Colonel Fitzgerald accompany him to inspect the damage caused. He agreed and, together with the prisoner representative and the leaders, saw the damage caused and heard a wounded prisoner shouting for help.

They entered the dining hall, where all the personnel were being guarded. The prisoner representative requested the release of these personnel, but his request was rejected. They went from the dining hall to the area where the stables were located. On the way, they saw forty prisoners being guarded, sitting on the ground with their hands covering their heads. One of the prisoners had been injured by a rifle butt. The prisoner representative did not know whether the camp commander had noticed this. The guards did not allow the prisoners to move the bodies or send the injured to the clinic. They continued down and found other prisoners in the tents. At the request of the representative, the colonel ordered their release. They came out of the tents and sat on the ground as ordered...

Another officer said that a few soldiers were missing, so the officer searched the camp, but except for finding a few injured prisoners, no American soldiers were found.

The prisoner representative saw soldiers kicking corpses. The bodies were loaded onto trucks without being examined by a doctor. The prisoner representative said that some of those considered dead were actually still alive. The prisoner representative and the prisoners in the clinic could not count how many corpses there were. After the military withdrew, the prisoner representative requested an audience with the camp commander to discuss the incident. The commander said he would return at 10 AM, but he did not return.

The representatives of the International Red Cross said in their report that the prisoners in Camp 62 of the Koje prisoner camp on February 18 were South Koreans, but they were captured while fighting for the North Korean army.

When they were visited on February 8 and 9 of this year, they said that they did not want to be repatriated to North Korea after the signing of the ceasefire agreement. They were recognized as South Korean citizens and were listed as detained civilians.

However, later, some of these prisoners requested to be sent back to North Korea after the ceasefire. Therefore, the camp authorities decided to re-screen to determine exactly who wanted to stay in South Korea and who wanted to be sent back to North Korea.

The prisoners opposed the new screening.

When the representatives of the International Red Cross spoke to the prisoners, they told them that since they had already signed a document stating that they wanted to be considered South Koreans, they would have to sign a new document if they changed their minds. The prisoner leader said they were not prepared to undergo a second screening and said that they had been under great pressure during the first screening.

The situation was like this. Even if the report of the Red Cross did not report everything that a true International Red Cross should report, based on the contents of this report alone, we can say that this is a judgment on the American military command, a judgment that Acheson cannot escape and does not want to publicize. Perhaps, Mr. Acheson will have something to say about this judgment now! It is worth noting that this report of the Red Cross was not submitted to the representatives of the Seventh Session of the United Nations. If it had not been published in the obscure "International Red Cross Review" of April, perhaps no one would have known about it. Where is this report? Why was it not sent to the representatives? Why did no one know about this report? Who should be held responsible for this? I think someone should answer these questions and explain this matter.

This report vividly describes the so-called "interrogation" method, which the American command used to "save"—as Acheson says—Korean and Chinese prisoners from the tyranny and revenge of their leaders.

Acheson tries to say that Korean and Chinese prisoners had already decided not to agree to be repatriated and had firmly resisted all attempts to send them home. But the facts seem to be that at dawn on February 18, fully armed American infantry attacked the Koje prisoner camp to prevent the prisoners from being handed over to the Korean and Chinese sides. This does not support Acheson's own words; Acheson had said that they had carefully screened the prisoners and tried to encourage them to agree to repatriation.

Acheson shamelessly tries to justify the massacre of Korean and Chinese prisoners, saying that the use of force is necessary to restore order and discipline. Acheson's words will not surprise anyone, because those who use inhuman bacteriological weapons and those who have consistently violated the most basic human morality and international law principles will not have a different attitude towards the massacre of unarmed prisoners.

General Clark's confession also proves the crime of forced detention of prisoners

On May 7, another massacre of Korean and Chinese prisoners occurred on the island of Koje, which was not an isolated incident. General Clark admitted that even before these incidents, bloodshed had occurred in the prisoner camps, and many prisoners had been killed or injured by United Nations forces.

General Clark said that he would do his utmost to prevent future atrocities and bloodshed. General Clark said that he could guarantee that prisoners could expect to receive humane treatment in accordance with the principles of international law in the prisoner camps. General Clark said that he could declare that after safely releasing General Dodd, there would be no more forced screening of prisoners or rearming of prisoners, and there would be no more attempts to conduct a meaningless screening.

His confession proves that the American camp authorities used violence and massacre to conduct forced screening, with the purpose of suppressing the just protests and resistance of Korean and Chinese prisoners.

The whole world knows the shocking document—"Our lives are in danger, help us escape this American hell"—the letter sent by the officers and soldiers of the People's Army on the island of Koje. This document is entirely worthy of our closest attention.

I will only cite one fact from the many facts in this document.

"On May 19, 1952, in Camp 66, American bandits created a despicable plot. They announced that all prisoners who wanted to go to North Korea must be ready to board the ship by 7 PM that evening and wait in their tents. Of course, no one was an exception; we all wanted to return to our homeland. When we lined up waiting to depart, the American soldiers suddenly opened fire with machine guns and flamethrowers on us. They even brought in tanks. Our comrades were killed on the spot, and many were injured."

On May 20 and 21, more than a thousand soldiers of the Korean People's Army were called to the American military headquarters for questioning and to hear the so-called "voluntary repatriation" proposal. When they returned, many had become mutilated, with some missing limbs, some with knife wounds on their chests, and some branded with marks on their backs, arms, or chests.

"On May 22 and 23, American guards also created similar bloody atrocities in Camps 602 and 73. Our comrades were killed by machine guns and grenades, and 88 were killed and 39 were injured or blown up.

"On May 23, in Camp 76, American executioners, to intimidate the 'disobedient,' had the heads of four patriots cut off and hung on trees. On the same day, American executioners also used electric shocks to blind 18 of our comrades in Tent 16.

"We are writing this letter as May 24 is about to arrive, but we clearly know that new persecutions, tortures, abuses, and humiliations are waiting for us.

"The camp commander Bonner has publicly threatened to take a heavy toll for the Dodd and Clark incidents."

This letter from the island of Koje is signed by 6,223 prisoners. Not only Bonner, but threats of further retaliation are also coming from General Clark, who arrived on the island of Koje in June. He said that the American military command was prepared to use the necessary maximum force against the prisoners and said that he did not like the communist flags flying over the prisoner camps.

All these events did not make Mr. Acheson uneasy. Acheson tried to portray the inhumane massacre of prisoners who protested against the so-called "interrogation" or "screening"—that is, the forced detention of prisoners—as natural, legal, and even humane.

All these events prove another irrefutable fact—the close unity, courage, and heroism of Korean and Chinese prisoners, which cannot be broken by the most brutal means taken to make Korean and Chinese patriots betray their cause and their homeland.

All of Acheson's attempts to justify the arbitrary threats and atrocities inflicted on unarmed Korean and Chinese prisoners in American prisoner camps have failed in the face of facts, which cannot be concealed, and facts that expose the inhuman atrocities in these prisoner camps. Recent news reports in American newspapers report new shooting incidents on the island of Koje: on October 1, 52 prisoners were killed by two volleys of American troops, and 113 prisoners were injured. These two volleys of American troops were sent to suppress the most serious—according to the "New York Times"—prisoner rebellion since the start of the Korean War.

According to reports in American newspapers, the cause of the incident is unknown, but it is clear that it occurred during the celebration of the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China by Chinese prisoners. According to a news report from the Associated Press, on October 24, nine communist prisoners were injured in the second prisoner camp in Busan. According to a statement from General Clark's headquarters, the main cause of this incident was the relocation of prisoner leaders to another prisoner camp.

Do these facts not prove that Acheson's arguments for justifying the so-called "screening" or "interrogation" of prisoners are completely untenable?

The American side's forced detention of prisoners is a blatant violation of international law and international customs

To justify the above atrocities, Mr. Acheson tries to prove here that the United States' position on the repatriation of prisoners is in accordance with international law and international customs. Mr. Acheson spends a lot of effort to justify the detention of prisoners by the detaining side on the grounds that they do not want to return home. Mr. Acheson tries to shift the attention of the First Committee and public opinion from the issue of not allowing forced repatriation during repatriation to the issue of "voluntary repatriation."

Mr. Acheson tries to prove that prisoners who do not want to be repatriated have now become an issue in the Korean ceasefire negotiations.

But that is not correct. As Acheson said, the issue is that the American military command is trying to force Korean and Chinese prisoners to give up repatriation and use forced screening to make them do so.

Mr. Acheson admits that in most prisoner camps, due to the resistance of the prisoners, the American military command has not been able to conduct interrogations. Despite this, the American authorities have continued to insist that the detaining side has no obligation to repatriate all prisoners and that they can "screen" those who do not want to be repatriated, using the methods and means we have seen in the prisoner camps on Koje Island, Jeju Island, Busan, and other places, to arbitrarily conduct the so-called "interrogations" of prisoners.

Mr. Acheson says that this is in complete accordance with the principles of international law and international customs. What is this about? This is about replacing one issue—international law does not allow forced interrogation and screening, because forced interrogation or screening actually means forced detention of prisoners—with another issue: international law does not allow forced repatriation of prisoners. Mr. Acheson cannot, and no one can, provide any evidence to prove that international law and international customs actually allow such forced screening that does not allow prisoners to exercise their right and opportunity to be repatriated. The forced interrogation—forced interrogation or screening—conducted by the American military command actually means forced detention of prisoners. Mr. Acheson suggests studying this issue and insists that the United States adheres to the humanitarian principles of the Geneva Convention, insisting that the United States' position on repatriation of prisoners is completely in accordance with the above convention.

We are prepared to study this issue to prove that the position of the American side is not only not in accordance with the Geneva Convention but also blatantly violates the Geneva Convention and the international customs based on the principles of this convention. It not only violates the 1949 convention but also violates the 1929 convention, the 1907 Hague Convention, and the customs of the United States itself. Just by analyzing some of the treaties signed by the United States, one can see this.

So, let's study this issue.

We believe that it is very important to study this issue from three perspectives—moral, political, and legal.

1. From a moral perspective, this issue is about allowing prisoners to freely express their will or have the freedom to will. However, if we ignore the conditions under which one can express a "free will," ignore all the conditions and environments that can form such a situation, can make them make various different decisions, and their influence, then we cannot determine this issue. Therefore, the first issue here is whether the status of being a prisoner and the situation in which he is can provide the necessary conditions for prisoners to make decisions without any influence. Just by raising this issue, it can be obviously seen that the answer is negative. Because being a prisoner is not a prerequisite for free choice and free decision-making, especially when one has to make such a decision under the threat of machine guns.

Everyone knows that prisoners are very easy to be subjected to illegal pressure from the authorities of the country that captured them, and like the American prisoner camps in Korea, they often suffer physical torture and abuse, so it is fundamentally impossible to raise the issue of free will.

Therefore, from the perspective of moral principles, it is absolutely unacceptable to require prisoners to acknowledge whether they want or do not want to return home. Acheson said that the general idea is that prisoners always want to return home. If that is the case, then why is there any need to conduct any interrogation to review the prisoners' desire to return home? Obviously, there is no such need and cannot be any need.

2. From a political perspective, any kind of interrogation of prisoners, or screening of prisoners, or classification of them according to whether they want or do not want to be repatriated, is untenable, because such actions are easily provocative and often have a provocative nature, and will produce serious political consequences, thereby violating the basic principles of normal relations between the relevant countries, that is, the principle of sovereign equality and mutual respect for political rights in both domestic and international relations.

There are many examples to prove that the purpose of the so-called interrogation and screening is to use these prisoners to oppose their own governments and harm the interests of their homeland. In the first few years after the First World War from 1914 to 1918, there were attempts to use Russian prisoners left in France, Britain, Austria-Hungary, and other countries after the war to oppose the Soviet Union.

In 1920, the French government took active measures to recruit Russian prisoners into the White Guard army. The French government violated its original promise of unconditional repatriation of all Russian prisoners in France and carried out the most arbitrary actions and cruel atrocities against unarmed prisoners. The telegram from the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic on July 29, 1919, mentioned the fact that the French government boasted of sending these Russian soldiers captured after the First World War in France to Denikin to fight against the young Soviet Republic. This action was carried out under various pretexts at that time. The telegram of the Soviet states correctly accused these actions of attempting to "treat prisoners as commodities to be traded in the market."

French Prime Minister Millerand sent a wireless telegram to the Soviet government on behalf of the French government on August 26, 1920:

"I have learned of your statement to Mr. Nansen that you agree with the French government's proposal to complete the exchange of all French prisoners in Russia and all Russian prisoners in France as soon as possible."

The Bulgarian Tsarist government was also involved in this matter. On March 29, 1920, a Bulgarian army colonel, Nakov, arrived at the concentration camp in Varna and told the Russian prisoners detained there that they should go to Crimea to join the anti-Soviet forces of the former general Frangell. The detained prisoners refused, but the camp was already surrounded by French and Bulgarian troops and Bulgarian cavalry; machine guns had been aimed at the prisoners, except for a few who escaped, most of them, under the threat of guns, were forced onto a ship and sent to Crimea.

I must mention the telegram from the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic on November 28, 1919, to the governments of France, Britain, the United States, Japan, and Italy. At that time, the so-called Allied Prisoner Repatriation Committee had actually become a committee to recruit counter-revolutionary bandits—the enemies of the Russian people. The Soviet government strongly protested against this illegal action and demanded that those governments take full responsibility for the fate of Russian prisoners, because the above-mentioned governments intended to force these prisoners to fight against their brothers. The Soviet government warned the above-mentioned governments that it reserved the right to take necessary measures and reminded them that the Soviet government had detained officers of the Allied Powers and many German prisoners, which made it easier for the Soviet government to take measures required by the vital interests of the Russian people.

At that time, those who liked to talk about theory also mentioned the free will of prisoners, their so-called unwillingness to be repatriated, their so-called willingness to stay in the so-called "free" countries of the capitalist world. However, in fact, the root cause of these events was to prevent these Russian prisoners from returning home in order to use them to strengthen the armies of Denikin, Frangell, Kolchak, Yudenich, and other similar enemies of the young Soviet Republic.

There is no doubt that the same trick is being repeated in the exchange of Korean and Chinese prisoners; the American military command, under the pretext that prisoners themselves do not want to be repatriated, is attempting to detain Korean and Chinese prisoners in order to send them to Taiwan and South Korea and use them to oppose their homeland.

3. When talking about legal considerations, Acheson tries to prove that the position of the United States is completely in accordance with international law and international customs.

Acheson believes that it is necessary to remind everyone of the treaties signed by the Soviet government in the early days of the revolution. He cited some agreements signed by the Soviet government from 1918 to 1920. Acheson said that these agreements prove that the Soviet government did not insist on repatriating those who wanted to stay in the country that captured them in those treaties. However, Acheson made his task too easy, and it is not that easy in fact.

When he analyzed the above treaties, he completely detached himself from the actual situation at that time, detached himself from the true situation at that time. He only saw the clauses of the treaties, the legal formulas, but he completely forgot the social relations that produced these clauses, the struggle between the opposing political ideas and currents at that time, the struggle between social and class interests, and all these struggles left their imprint in these clauses.

The treaties that Acheson talked about are only the result of that struggle, and naturally, they could not help but bear certain traces of compromise. We must not overlook this, because if we look at a document out of context, take away its necessary content, then it is impossible to properly estimate this document. To make everyone understand the basic principles followed by the Soviet government in preparing and concluding any treaties, including the part about the prisoner issue that Acheson mentioned, it is necessary to analyze the process and situation of the development of events at that time and that era; it is necessary to estimate the content and nature of this or that diplomatic document based on the characteristics of the domestic and international situation of the Soviet state at that time and its relations with the countries known to want to destroy the young Soviet Republic; it is necessary to study not only these agreements but also other documents that reflect the political and international position of the Soviet Union during this period. In this way, people will not make hasty and unfounded conclusions and judgments about the agreements mentioned by Acheson in his speech on October 24.

We understand that Acheson mentioned the above agreements of the Soviet government regarding the exchange of prisoners because he wanted to use them to prove that the Soviet government has consistently adhered to the principle of using the willingness of prisoners to be repatriated as the basis for repatriation. But he did not consider several specific circumstances. If we study the agreements mentioned by Acheson, such as the agreement between the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and Britain signed in Copenhagen in 1920, we will definitely see that the Soviet government indeed agreed in the seventh article of this agreement to repatriate all British prisoners who wished to be repatriated. However, the first article of this agreement stipulates that the British government must repatriate all Russian prisoners in the British Empire or in any place under British jurisdiction without the need for prisoners to express their willingness to be repatriated. This can also be seen from the telegram of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs on December 19, 1919, which wrote about this issue:

"From the beginning, we proposed to Britain a true comprehensive exchange, that is, we release all British personnel, and Britain releases all our personnel they are detaining, including employees of our mission in Persia arrested by Britain, and Britain must remove obstacles for our prisoners and citizens to return from Germany and from the neutral countries with which we will conduct separate negotiations on this issue." Here, you can see an important fact: a treaty has two articles regarding the repatriation of prisoners. We Russians at that time demanded the return of all prisoners to our side, but we were prepared to agree to the demand that only those who wished to return home be repatriated to Britain. Acheson did not notice this subtle difference between the two articles. He probably did not look at the original text of the agreement. He probably only looked at the memorandum drafted by the secretary. However, for us ministers, it is very dangerous to only look at the memorandum drafted by the secretary without detailed verification.

It must be pointed out that the British government proposed to hand over 100 Russians transported from the north to England to the Soviet government, while the Soviet government should release all British personnel—prisoners and civilians. The Soviet government opposed this proposal.

In the telegram on November 29 of the same year, the Soviet government firmly advocated "the comprehensive exchange of our and Allied prisoners." Lord Curzon rejected this plan applicable to all Allies and proposed to exchange officers and soldiers on a one-to-one basis first, and then exchange civilian prisoners on the same principle.

If we carefully study the above telegrams, we will not fail to notice that the Soviet government never mentioned in these telegrams that only those prisoners who expressed their willingness to be repatriated should be exchanged.

Acheson mentioned the agreement between the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and France established on April 20, 1920. However, if he had studied this issue more seriously rather than relying on the memoranda clearly drafted by those who did not want to delve into these issues, he would have to notice the telegram sent by the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic to the then French Foreign Minister Pichon on July 29, 1919. Pichon said: "His desire to repatriate these Russians is definite and is not affected by any negotiations with the Soviet Union. The French government will continue to automatically send them back home," that is, without any conditions attached, in short, it is to acknowledge the principle of repatriating all prisoners without any kind of screening. The Soviet government completely agreed with this. The French Foreign Ministry reiterated this promise in subsequent telegrams regarding this issue, without mentioning any exchange conditions.

However, the Pichon government did not fulfill its promise, and the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs rightly accused the French government of saying that from the subsequent developments, especially the landing of Russian soldiers repatriated from France, "it is impossible to expect the current French government to have the slightest expression of nobility and gratitude. The solemn declarations and promises of the French government, although repeated many times, are of no value."

The problem is that although Pichon promised to "definitely and without any influence of negotiations" (that is, without any conditions) repatriate Russian prisoners, when a part of the Russian soldiers were transported to the port of Odessa, Pichon put forward conditions that all Russian soldiers captured by the Russian army in Ukraine and even including citizens of neutral countries must be handed over to the French government, and threatened that if this condition was not fulfilled, they would hand over the Russian soldiers to Denikin, intensify the blockade of the Black Sea coast, and bombard Odessa.

At such a time, the Soviet government remained true to its principles and insisted on its principles, not attaching any conditions to the exchange of prisoners. At the same time, the Soviet government opposed the blackmail of the French authorities, who used the Russians repatriated from France, who were suffering from pain and exhaustion, as a tool for blackmail.

The above examples prove that the individual points cited by Acheson from the agreements on the exchange of prisoners signed by the Soviet government from 1918 to 1920 do not themselves explain the principled position of the Soviet government on this issue. From the above, it can be clearly seen that these agreements are the product of the specific conditions at that time, when the Soviet Union was in the midst of a fierce struggle to overcome the difficulties on the road to the great October Socialist Revolution, and therefore, it made such decisions in its relations with other countries, especially in the demands of these countries regarding the repatriation of prisoners, as it had to make under the historical conditions at that time.

Acheson mentioned the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. But he must know that this treaty was forced upon the Soviet Union and was a highly plundering and despicable treaty. This alone requires us to be cautious and not draw conclusions based on such materials.

What are the principles of international law on this issue? These principles are clearly stipulated in several international conventions, such as Article 20 of the Hague Convention, which states: "After peace is concluded between two nations, all prisoners of war shall be released as soon as possible."

The 1929 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War, Article 75, states: "In any case, the repatriation of prisoners of war shall be carried out as soon as possible after the conclusion of peace."

The 1949 Geneva Convention, Article 118, states: "After the cessation of actual hostilities, prisoners of war shall be released and repatriated immediately, without delay."

From the following section, it can be seen that this article is clearly stipulated:

"In the event that the parties to the conflict conclude an armistice agreement, if there are no provisions regarding the above matters, or if such an agreement cannot be concluded, each detaining power shall immediately formulate and execute a repatriation plan in accordance with the principles set forth in the preceding paragraph, without delay."

At the same time, it can be asserted based on Article 118 that other clauses in bilateral agreements between the relevant parties shall not impair the effectiveness of the above international conventions.

The same article stipulates that if there is no agreement regarding the cost of transporting prisoners of war, the conclusion of such an agreement "shall not be used as a reason for delaying the repatriation of prisoners of war." The only exception to this reservation is included in Article 119 of this convention, which stipulates that prisoners of war who are being prosecuted for criminal offenses or have been convicted of criminal offenses may be detained.

From Article 7 of the 1949 Geneva Convention, it can also be seen that all the articles of this convention are clearly stipulated. Article 7 stipulates:

"In any case, prisoners of war shall not waive the rights granted to them by this convention or the special agreement mentioned in the preceding article—if such an agreement is made—partially or entirely."

This article is very clear, and there is no reason to say that prisoners themselves do not want to be repatriated, using this as an excuse to detain the prisoners they are holding. During the 1949 Geneva International Conference, there was a debate over the Austrian representative's proposal to recognize the right of prisoners of war to refuse repatriation. At that conference, the Soviet delegation firmly opposed this proposal. I must point out that, thanks to the efforts of the American delegation, American representative General Parker also opposed the Austrian proposal with the Soviet representative and the majority at that conference.

At the same time, I cannot but remind Mr. Lloyd that at the 1949 Geneva Conference, the British representative said that it was unwise to pass such an amendment, because the detaining country of prisoners of war has the obligation to send the prisoners of war back to the countries they served in when they were captured. The Austrian amendment was rejected by the majority at that conference.

This is the main principle of international law, and Acheson did not mention a word about this principle, although he spent almost three hours expounding his position and trying to justify the club law and lawless atrocities committed by the American command against Korean and Chinese prisoners in violation of the basic principles of international law and international customs.

The resolution of the United Nations General Assembly on peaceful settlement of the prisoner issue also proves this.

Everyone knows that this resolution seeks to be hostile to the Soviet Union, and Acheson has already confirmed this in his speech. However, since the general issue of prisoner exchange is clearly stipulated in that resolution, Acheson cannot deny the fact that that resolution directly refutes the principle he is trying to defend here; that resolution requires all countries to adhere to the recognized norms of international relations and the 1949 Geneva Convention, and requires them to have no reservations on the issue of voluntariness, which is precisely what Acheson emphasizes most in his speech.

Acheson tries to justify the actions taken by the American military command in Korea and the American government on the issue of prisoner exchange and claims that these actions are in accordance with the principles of international public law and international customs. Can all the facts and materials mentioned above still not make Acheson realize how groundless his attempts and statements are!

Acheson mentioned the above resolution, and to refute the absolutely incorrect position taken by the American military command in Korea on the issue of prisoner exchange, to prove that the American command in Korea has seriously violated the 1949 Geneva Convention, this is precisely the best method.

Acheson, in concluding his speech, said a nice-sounding sentence, saying that the American authorities advocate the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue on the basis of sincerity.

However, if he insists on the American proposal to forcibly detain prisoners, this means that in fact, he intends to take a different position, which cannot be said to be a sincere basis.

Conclusion: The main principles of international law and international customs are that prisoners must be exchanged unconditionally, without restrictions, and completely, that is, the detaining side must guarantee the repatriation of all prisoners, not allowing any excuses to be made, not taking any artificial measures, especially not taking savage violence such as torture and killing prisoners to forcibly prevent these prisoners from returning home; not taking measures to cover up their illegal actions with deceitful, hypocritical words such as the "free will" and "voluntary repatriation" of prisoners. The Soviet Union adheres to this fundamental principle of international law, defends this principle, and will continue to defend it, just as everyone is prepared to defend their country. In contrast, those who place the selfish interests of personal groups above the interests of the homeland and the interests of peaceful cooperation violate this principle. It is our duty to warn them not to take such steps. Otherwise, the United Nations will not be able to fulfill its mission, and the prestige and reputation of the United Nations will be seriously tarnished.

Many agreements signed by the United States also stipulate that all prisoners must be repatriated

In addition to the above, it is necessary to point out a few points based on the following fact. This fact is that Mr. Acheson, on the one hand, talks at length about the agreements signed by the Soviet Union from 1918 to 1920, and on the other hand, remains silent about the agreements signed by the United States, although these agreements are directly related to the exchange of prisoners. This is understandable, because these treaties, such as the treaty between the United States and Spain in 1898, are based not on the so-called "voluntary repatriation" principle but on the principle of the unconditional exchange of prisoners recognized by international law. Acheson also remains silent about the Treaty of Versailles in 1918, a work of President Wilson of the United States, which is particularly noteworthy on this issue. This treaty's Article 220 also discusses the principle of unconditional repatriation.

Is it necessary to mention the ceasefire agreements signed by the United States during World War II? These agreements unanimously require the immediate repatriation of all prisoners, without mentioning a word about "freely expressing one's will." Is it worth mentioning Article 71 of the Italian Peace Treaty? This article clearly states:

"Italian prisoners of war should be repatriated as soon as possible in accordance with the agreements reached between the detaining countries and Italy." In the treaties with Romania (Article 20), Bulgaria (Article 19), and Hungary (Article 21), there are similar provisions. Everyone knows that all these treaties are also signed by the United States of America.

If we look at the declaration on the defeat of Germany and the documents on the surrender of Japan, we can know that these documents also stipulate that the German and Japanese authorities must release all prisoners of war belonging to the United Nations without any reservations and hand them over to the representatives of the Allies.

Article 6 of the declaration on the defeat of Germany states: "The German authorities must release all prisoners of war belonging to the United Nations military currently in their hands, hand them over to the representatives of the Allies, and provide the complete list of these people, stating where they are being detained in Germany or German-occupied territory."

Article 7 of the Japanese surrender document states: "We now order the Japanese Imperial Government and the Japanese Imperial General Staff to immediately release all prisoners of war and detained civilians currently under Japanese control, and to protect, care for, and feed them and send them to designated places immediately."

Mr. Acheson obviously believes that bilateral agreements acknowledging the possibility of refusing repatriation prove that there are such agreements in international customs. However, here, two situations must be remembered: 1. If there is an agreement that specifically stipulates the right to refuse repatriation of prisoners, then this fact only proves that the universally recognized principle of not allowing the refusal of repatriation of prisoners is valid.

The British saying "the exception proves the rule" is not without reason.

2. If the principle insisted on by the American delegation supporting the Korean military command is important in international law, then there is no need to conclude special agreements to limit this principle. The international law norm is sufficient. However, there is no such norm. Instead, there is a norm that directly excludes the principle that the American government is trying to execute. But this government does not want to adhere to the recognized norm because it is unfavorable to them.

To understand the general or unanimous opinion of scientists, it is worth consulting scientists—the authorities on international law. From the statements of the famous British lawyer and international law expert Professor Oppenheim, the American Professor Fenwick, Professor Wilson of Harvard University, the famous French lawyer and international law expert Fauchille, the famous Russian international law expert Professor Martens, and many others, it can be seen that they all hold the same view: after the conclusion of peace, prisoners of war must be immediately repatriated, which is stipulated in the 1907 Hague Convention, which is the situation when the United States and Spain concluded the treaty in 1898, and this is also stipulated in Article 10 of the armistice agreement with Germany on November 11, 1918.

We can draw the following self-evident conclusion: the recognized principles and norms of international law must be adhered to, and when these principles and norms are recorded in international conventions signed by many countries, it is even more so. These countries have signed such international conventions and must bear moral and legal responsibilities. International law cannot be treated like a stick, arbitrarily changing according to this or that temporary interest and selfish purpose. It is not expected that such a lawless attitude will not be condemned by public opinion, will not suffer the strongest protests from all righteous people, and will not arouse opposition—the conscience of peace-loving people, when it is shocked and insulted, will inevitably produce such opposition.

The issue of prisoner exchange is currently the only obstacle to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the end of the Korean War, which has been going on for more than two years, and the suffering and hardship it has caused. A calm and objective study of the issue of prisoner exchange will inevitably reveal the justice of the position taken by the Korean and Chinese sides. All peace-loving, good people must support this position because it opens the way for the early end of the Korean War and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

The proposal prepared by the United States and subsequently jointly submitted by the delegations of some countries participating in the Korean War cannot meet this requirement and should reject this completely unsatisfactory proposal.

The activities of the "Korean Unification and Reconstruction Committee" prove that it has become a tool of the American military

Among the many important issues related to the Korean situation, one of great significance is the issue of unifying and reconstructing Korea.

The committee established to promote the resolution of this issue has not fulfilled its mission and has proven to be completely incapable of completing this important task of helping Korea's unification and reconstruction. Moreover, it has not even made efforts to achieve this goal, because from its report, especially the seventy-seventh section, it has become a tool of the American military.

The entire activities of the Korean Unification and Reconstruction Committee prove that the establishment of this committee is not at all to help Korea's unification and reconstruction, but to create the impression that the American invaders have taken on this task, to deceive public opinion. In fact, they have not taken on this task, and as long as they continue to wage the savage war of aggression against the Korean people, continue to destroy entire cities and villages, continue to trample on Korean territory, and continue to massacre Korean civilians, they cannot take on this task. The American invaders, under the banner of the United Nations, actually taking on the task of reconstructing Korea and working for Korea's unification—this is obviously absurd. The war imposed on the Korean people further deepens the division between North and South Korea, and unification is out of the question; the savage bombing of the rear of North Korea eliminates all possibilities for reconstruction work.

The Soviet delegation proposes to establish a committee to take measures to peacefully resolve the Korean issue

It is clear that the current main task on the Korean issue is to end the war and peacefully resolve the Korean issue.

The proposal of the Polish delegation fully meets this requirement because these proposals together constitute a comprehensive program of action aimed at effectively resolving the most fundamental and important issue—Korean peace and war. Due to the incorrect decision made by the First Committee in determining the order of discussion of the issues, the proposal of the Polish delegation will be discussed later. Currently, the item on the agenda is the report of the United Nations Korean Unification and Reconstruction Committee. According to the task of this item, the Soviet delegation proposes several proposals for the First Committee to discuss, and the Soviet delegation also believes that these proposals will receive the proper support of all delegations that are sincerely striving for the unification and reconstruction of Korea.

Our proposal is as follows: "The General Assembly has studied the report of the Korean Unification and Reconstruction Committee and believes that it is necessary:

To establish a committee for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, with the participation of the directly concerned parties and other countries, including countries that have not participated in the Korean War.

To instruct the above committee to immediately take measures to resolve the Korean issue in the spirit of Korea's unification by Koreans themselves under the supervision of the above committee."

### 维辛斯基十月二十九日在联大政治委员会关于朝鲜问题的演说

    维辛斯基十月二十九日在联大政治委员会关于朝鲜问题的演说
    议程上关于朝鲜统一复兴委员会的报告的问题已经变成了整个的朝鲜问题，变成了强加在朝鲜人民头上的战争和结束这个战争的希望的问题、在朝鲜停战和实现和平的问题。
    所有爱好和平的人民和全体进步人类都很关心停止朝鲜战争和缔结停战协定。许多国家的强大的人民和平运动都和要求结束朝鲜战争并以和平方式解决朝鲜问题的斗争直接联结在一起。
    波兰人民共和国代表团响应大声疾呼反对战争、保卫和平的亿万人民的这些坚决的要求，在本届联合国大会刚一开始的时候就提出了它的建议，而在建议中占首位的就是朝鲜问题。波兰代表团在苏联和其它许多代表团的支持下，坚持把这些建议，包括关于朝鲜问题的建议在内，列在议程的第一项，并且由第一委员会首先加以讨论。
    这个提案遭到了某些代表团，主要是以美国为首的北大西洋集团的代表团的毫无根据的反对，因而被否决了。关于上述朝鲜统一复兴委员会的报告的问题终于被列为议程的第一项，虽然从一开头就很明显，这个问题不能和整个朝鲜问题，即朝鲜和平与战争问题，分开来考虑。
    艾奇逊有意捏造历史事实歪曲苏美联合委员会的活动
    十月二十四日，第一委员会听取了美利坚合众国国务卿的一篇演说。这篇演说几乎占去了三小时的时间，但是，和我们按议程所预料的相反，其中丝毫没有提到朝鲜统一复兴委员会的报告，而把注意力都集中在朝鲜问题从开头到现在的经过上面。
    艾奇逊先生在第一委员会发言时，给自己规定了这样的任务：广泛研究整个朝鲜问题、这个问题的发展过程以及最近几年来联合国在朝鲜事件中的作用。艾奇逊先生给自己规定了一个艰巨而责任重大的任务，这个任务只有在遵守某些条件的情况下才能完成，然而，也有意地漠视了这些条件。这些条件就是在叙述事实时必须有客观态度，就是要提供历史真相，这种历史真相是和武断处理事实的行为，特别是捏造事实的行为水火不相容的。
    艾奇逊先生走了另外一条路，他曲解事实，有意造成大错，不惜进行直接的歪曲。现在让我们看一看事实吧。
    艾奇逊先生一开头就谈到美国、英国和中国代表在一九四三年十二月举行的开罗会议，这次会议通过了一项涉及朝鲜问题的宣言，苏联后来也赞同这个宣言。他追溯了一九四五年十二月十六日到十二月二十六日举行的苏、美、英三国外长莫斯科会议，在这个会议上关于朝鲜问题达成了协议。这次会议通过了一项关于协助临时的朝鲜民主政府的建立的重要决定，为此目的，成立了一个联合委员会，由朝鲜南部美军司令部与朝鲜北部苏军司令部的代表组成。委员会的主要任务是草拟关于协助朝鲜人民在政治、经济、社会上的进步（托管）、建立民主自治与朝鲜之国家独立的各项建议。联合委员会在进行这项工作时，必须邀请临时的朝鲜民主政府参加，并吸收朝鲜的民主团体，与它们协商。必须承认：艾奇逊先生在这里，在第一委员会上，极力想歪曲有关联合委员会的活动与莫斯科会议的工作的事实。
    艾奇逊先生就丝毫没有谈到——例如说——这样一件重要的事情：协助朝鲜人民在政治、经济、社会上的进步及建立朝鲜的民主自治。但是他却不遗余力地把事情说得好像美国为了使朝鲜的行政与经济方面的活动协调一致而苦心拟定的种种措施都被苏联藉口恐怕侵犯朝鲜北部苏联的绝对权力范围而拒绝了。
    现在并没有必要来驳斥这种谰言，因为苏联从来没有说过这类的话。
    事实上，情况跟艾奇逊先生所说的完全不同。事实上，苏联代表团曾声明：应以一种互相交换等量货物的方式，组织南北朝鲜之间的贸易。苏军司令部考虑到南朝鲜的需要，同意供给南朝鲜以必要的电力、煤、化学肥料、钢、铜、锌、铅、各种酸、木材及其他物品，共值八千九百五十三万九千二百八十九元。
    苏军司令部则计划为北朝鲜取得占南朝鲜交货总额三分之二的粮食（大米）、以及为北朝鲜铁路、煤矿和电力工业所需的零件及供应品等等。
    美方在答复苏联代表团的声明的时候，开出了一个消费品、零件和零星物件的清单，总值六百万元。后来这个清单又加以扩充，总值增加到一千万元。
    因此，美国的建议根本不合乎双方已经达成的等量交换的谅解，而打算让北朝鲜赊给南朝鲜共值七千九百万元的货物。美国的建议里面完全剔除了粮食交货一项，虽然苏联代表团曾明确地说明：“要看美军司令部是否交换粮食以供给制造物品而需要米粮的北朝鲜劳动人民之用，苏军司令部才能决定交换货物的问题。”
    美国希望造成北朝鲜的饥荒，希望妨害苏联的政策，便断然拒绝运米到北朝鲜。因此，苏联代表团不得不暂停考虑交换货物的问题，等到“美军司令部能够保证南朝鲜把工业所需要的零件及工业工人所需要的粮食运往北朝鲜，双方交换的总数大体相等”的时候再作考虑。
    苏联始终支持朝鲜独立民主统一美国一贯进行分裂和反民主活动
    在五月六日的联合委员会会议上，苏联代表团坚决主张，当前的任务不是像美国所建议的在南朝鲜设立一个管理经济的民政机构，而是要设立一个临时朝鲜民主政府，但是美国顽固地对这一点置之不理。
    艾奇逊先生谈到托管问题时没有提到：原来的美国贝尔纳斯草案根本不曾规定组织一个朝鲜全国的政府，只强调要在朝鲜设立一个以两位军事司令官为首的行政机关，在托管制度实行以前，由他们负责治理朝鲜。
    莫斯科会议认为，必须根据苏联政府的建议设立一个临时朝鲜民主政府，这个建议指出这是符合于朝鲜人民迫切的民族要求的，同时也能够促进早日消除日本长期统治朝鲜所遗留下来的恶果。
    美国提案主张成立一个由四国（苏联、美国、英国和中国）代表组成的执行理事会，授与行政、立法和司法权力。这个美国提案仍然没有规定成立朝鲜政府。
    可是，莫斯科会议认为必须成立临时朝鲜政府，必须成立苏美联合委员会以协助完成这一件重要的工作。苏联政府从一开头就一贯支持旨在建立一个真正独立、民主、统一的朝鲜的各项措施。
    艾奇逊先生谈到与民主党派进行协商的问题的时候，说得温和一点，也显然是不合事实。艾奇逊先生仅仅把当时任国务卿的马歇尔关于这个问题所发表的意见重新说一遍，把整个事情缩小成“民主”这个字眼的定义问题，而实际上问题并不在于字眼，而在于更为严重的分歧，这种分歧的产生是由于事实上美国代表干脆破坏了上述莫斯科会议规定与朝鲜的民主党派和公众团体进行协商的决定。
    苏美联合委员会的美国代表团企图主要把李承晚集团中的党派列入这种所谓“民主”党派中。
    他们企图不把南朝鲜的许多强大的民主团体列入真正的民主党派中间，这些民主团体有朝鲜劳动组合全国评议会，全国农民组合总联盟，民族革命党，朝鲜民主青年同盟及其他拥有数百万会员的团体。美国代表团曾建议邀请在国内没有威望而且仅代表南朝鲜思想反动的上层小集团的小团体参加协商。
    艾奇逊先生在这里错误地说什么苏联反对邀请这些反对莫斯科协定所规定的托管办法的政治团体或党派参加协商。
    苏联曾坚决主张与那些完全支持莫斯科关于朝鲜问题的决定的民主党派和组织进行协商。苏联坚决主张被邀请与联合委员会进行协商的政党或群众组织不得任命那些因积极反对莫斯科协定而丧失声誉的人充当协商代表。
    从美国司令官在一九四六年十二月二十四日的信件中看出他曾经同意这些建议，但是他作了某些修改。
    莫洛托夫在一九四七年五月七日致马歇尔的一封信中同意了这些修改，并表示希望从此再不会有理由来拖延举行苏美联合委员会的会议，因为这个会议的召开显然因朝鲜民主党派参加协商问题上有分歧而受到阻挠。但是，美国方面却继续实行它的反民主方针——支持反动组织，阻挠民主组织参加协商。
    美国政府不仅把它所不喜欢但却真正民主的一切党派和团体都不列入民主党派与团体名单内，而且还对支持莫斯科决议和联合委员会决议的南朝鲜的真正民主党派与团体发动了镇压。
    民主党派和团体的代表一个接着一个地被捕了。一九四七年，南朝鲜民主民族阵线中央委员会及其出版社的许多领导干部和工作人员及南朝鲜民主民族阵线市郡委员会的领导干部都被逮捕了。被捕的还有南朝鲜农民组合总同盟的主席及其他重要人员、南朝鲜劳动组合全国评议会会员、南朝鲜民主妇女同盟、协同组合中央联盟、作家协会、律师协会及许多其他组织的领导干部。此外，劳动党的领袖们也被捕了。
    十分自然，联合委员会的苏联代表团不能容忍这种情况，因此要求美国代表团立即采取措施恢复民主党派和团体在南朝鲜存在和活动的正常情况以及苏美联合委员会进行工作的适当条件。
    莫洛托夫在一九四七年八月二十三日给马歇尔的信中也指出了这一点。当时他强调指出：这种情况是反常的，不能容许的；它使得三国外长莫斯科会议关于朝鲜问题的决议根本不可能正确实现，除非这种对南朝鲜民主团体与领袖的迫害立即完全终止。
    当时的代理国务卿罗维特先生在给莫洛托夫的复信中并没有否认在美国占领区有逮捕民主党派与团体的代表的情事。他企图为这种逮捕辩解，说这是为了扑灭意图推翻合法政权及危害美国占领区治安的所谓破坏活动所必需的。实际上，根本没有任何“破坏活动”。问题不是别的，而是要镇压为真正统一朝鲜与建立独立民主的朝鲜国而奋斗的南朝鲜民主运动。
    艾奇逊先生在这里把罗维特的信大事渲染，把这封信说成美国旨在促成朝鲜统一并保证朝鲜的独立与民主制度的所谓民主政策的证明。实际上，罗维特的信却证明了美国当局根本不想帮助朝鲜建立一个真正的民主政府。我们只要追述一下美国关于朝鲜问题的建议就够了。据罗维特的解释，美国的建议规定成立临时的所谓地区立法议会，根据美国的计划，由地区立法议会成立一个临时的全国立法议会，也就是临时的全朝鲜立法议会。但是这样一种在南北朝鲜，也就是在苏联和美国地区成立临时立法议会的建议不但不能够消除当时已经存在的朝鲜分裂为两个地区的状态，反而会使朝鲜的分裂永远继续下去，这难道不是很明显的吗？
    苏联政府坚决地恪守莫斯科会议关于在民主的基础上统一朝鲜的规定，自然不能接受罗维特的建议。苏联政府拒绝了美国的分裂建议，这竟被当作拒绝再与苏联政府就朝鲜问题进行谈判的藉口。
    艾奇逊先生在这里说，当时美国开始认识，对于与苏联进行双边谈判不能再抱什么希望了；又说美国方面就得出结论，认为他们已经尽了最大力量来使问题有所进展，但却没有得到对方的响应。因此，美国政府才把这个问题提到联合国来。
    美国到底做了些什么事情，它的行为是否——用艾奇逊的话来说——能够使得问题有所进展，在我先前说的话里面，可以看得很清楚。对于这个问题，必须给予否定的回答。美国没有做任何事情来使问题有所进展，也就是说没有做任何事情来保证南朝鲜民主运动的成功，来实现朝鲜的统一和民主化，来恢复它的国民经济和文化，而这都是那个时期在北朝鲜进行的事情，北朝鲜还完成了影响深远的民主改革，来保证广泛的政治自由并增进人民的幸福。
    当时，在南朝鲜反动势力横行、人们的基本自由与人权受到压制的时候，北朝鲜实行了普选，颁布了妇女与男子平等的法律，在自由民主选举的基础上成立了地方政权机关和北朝鲜人民委员会；实行了土地改革，使七十二万五千少地无地的农户无偿地得到一百多万公顷以前属于日本殖民者及其朝鲜帮凶的土地。同时还把以前日本的工业收归国有；颁布了八小时工作、劳动保险和社会保险的法律；在学校里采用了朝鲜语，各地增设了学校；实行了公共教育改革，学生的人数有了显著的增加。
    当时，在一九四七年，苏联政府就已经建议首先采取下列措施：
    一、在朝鲜民主党派和人民团体广泛参加的基础上成立临时朝鲜民主政府，以便加速朝鲜的政治与经济统一，成为一个不受外国干涉的独立国家，这就可以结束朝鲜分裂为两个地区的局面。
    二、以普遍平等投票为基础的自由选举的方式，在全朝鲜成立民主的政权机关。
    三、援助朝鲜人民重建朝鲜为独立的民主国和发展他们的国民经济与民族文化。
    同时，苏联政府建议，苏美联合委员会在严格履行莫斯科会议关于朝鲜的协议的基础上，恢复工作；同时至迟在一九四七年七月或八月以前，把拟定关于成立临时朝鲜民主政府的建议的工作结果提交苏联和美国政府考虑。
    在第二届联合国大会前夕，参加联合委员会的苏联代表团为了加速建立临时朝鲜民主政府的工作，接受了美国代表团的一个建议，即不与朝鲜民主党派和人民团体进行口头协商——这是在该委员会引起分歧的问题，同时提出了一个新建议，主张成立一个由全朝鲜各民主党派和人民团体代表组成的全朝鲜临时人民议会，作为谘询机关。这个建议被美国代表团拒绝了。
    在美国政府决定阻挠与苏联在莫斯科会议决定的基础上进一步合作以解决朝鲜问题的时候，在美国政府决定更顽固地努力使朝鲜永久分裂下去并实现它的反动侵略计划的时候，事情的真相就是这样。
    这就是违反关于朝鲜的现行国际协定而把朝鲜问题提到联合国大会上来的真正原因。
    美国扶植卖国贼李承晚集团以达到榨取南朝鲜富源目的
    艾奇逊先生的演说有一大部分是企图指责北朝鲜与苏联在南朝鲜进行所谓意图推翻李承晚政府的破坏活动。他指出苏联当时特别注意从朝鲜人中训练拥护苏联、在北朝鲜的政党与国家机关中担任要职的干部。在他的演说中，当然有国务院的一贯反苏谰言，说什么苏联秘密警察在北朝鲜活动，说什么苏联“统治”北朝鲜政府。
    在这里来说明这种话是多么无稽与荒谬，实在是多余的。艾奇逊先生所以在这个题目上大放厥词，其目的是要转移公众的视线，使他们不注意美国依靠它在半封建地主代表中挑选出来的走狗在南朝鲜进行的反民主活动，这些半封建地主是朝鲜最反动的阶级，他们过去是日本殖民统治的支柱，多年来积极帮助日本殖民者奴役朝鲜，在日本刺刀的保护下掠夺朝鲜并蹂躏朝鲜人民。
    这些人中间有凶暴的日本特务，如恶名昭著的“棉业大王”、大地主金性洙与金龙周，飞机公司主人朴兴植，以及这些人的亲信，他们都是反动官僚的代表，以出卖民族的代价换得在殖民机构中服务的权利。
    大家知道，李承晚的整个活动充分明显地说明了这个顽固法西斯分子的政治性格，他是远在一九四五年十月就被匆匆忙忙地用飞机从美国送回去的。
    艾奇逊在这里的演说中企图诽谤一些献身为朝鲜人民谋福利并不倦地为巩固朝鲜和苏联的友谊与合作而努力的爱国人士。这些人士在过去和将来始终会受到苏联人民的充分报答。苏联人民坚定不移地与其他国家中为维护合法的民族利益、争取民主改革、争取他们祖国的自由与独立而斗争的进步人士保持友谊。
    但是，我们对李承晚有什么话说呢？他曾经是朝鲜国王秘密御前会议的大臣，他曾与亲日分子积极合作，他远在一八九八年被判处终身劳役，后来是由于日本驻韩公使的搭救才被释放的。
    大家知道，李承晚在一九零四年前往美国，一九一零年朝鲜被日本并吞之后又回到朝鲜，重新为他的日本帝国主义主子们服务。以后，他再度出现于美国，博取新主子们的欢心。他在一九二零年至一九二二年之间曾利用他的关系，致力于使朝鲜成为美国的委任统治地。
    像这样的一个人，当然对美国占领当局是很有用处的，美国占领当局知道他们支持李承晚这个殖民地统治的老手是为了什么，这种殖民地统治就是一种压迫人民的制度和旷古未闻的残暴行为以及对群众的劫掠和野蛮剥削的结合体。
    李承晚还不是一个独一无二的角色。在南朝鲜的统治集团中还有像他这样的地道的反动分子，例如：李范奭，他同时也是朝鲜青年法西斯组织的领袖；外交部长官张泽相，他是前汉城警察厅厅长，素有大刽子手的恶名；公共工程部长官钱镇汉，他是反动工会的领袖；法务部长官李仁，他是前日本法院的官员；内政部长官尹致暎，从前是朝鲜亲日组织中的活跃分子。
    美国当局曾与所有这些先生们——公开的与暗藏的卖国贼和日本特务——保持了最密切的联系，这是早经伦敦杂志“新政治家与民族”在一九四五年报道过了的。美国垄断资本家靠着这个所谓政府的帮助，即开始大力榨取南朝鲜的天然富源——钨、钼及其他有战略重要性的稀有金属——从而大发横财。
    同时，南朝鲜的农民和广大劳动人民的生活状况坏到了悲惨的境地。失业人数不断地增加，在某些时期曾达到二百万人，甚至差不多三百万人。由于不堪负担的地租和各种苛捐杂税的压迫，农民生活苦不堪言。在一九四四年到一九四七年之间，耕地面积减少了百分之三十一，米的产量也有大约相同比率的减低。南朝鲜本来是全国的谷仓，现在经常遭受严重的粮荒，人民不得不过着受苦挨饿的生活。但是殖民者的利润和地主们的收入却不断增加。
    南朝鲜人民的生活日益恶化，有如江河之日下。甚至联合国的朝鲜委员会对这种情况也无法掩饰；该委员会的一九四八年第一季度报告指出：继续破坏南朝鲜经济的因素至今仍然存在。该委员会的一九四九年至一九五○年（直至九月四日止）的报告强调说：一九四九年南朝鲜的财政状况仍然在继续恶化。据该委员会说：经济恶化的主要原因之一，是增加了一笔额外的巨额费用来维持从事镇压人民对李承晚政权的义愤的军警。憎恨李承晚政权的，不仅是朝鲜人民，而且还包括南朝鲜社会上那些在美国军事当局的逼迫下与李承晚合作的一大部分人士在内。联合国委员会也承认。人民主要粮食——大米——的价格不断上涨已使一般老百姓惶惶不安。
    美国当局想要在一九五零年上半年在南朝鲜实行的所谓“经济稳定”计划，结果是彻底地失败了。李承晚当局的贪污腐化和唯利是图腐蚀了整个政府机构。所谓“自愿捐献”的办法，实际上就是替军警，甚至是替某些受到李承晚政府的庇护的某些“协会”，向人民勒索钱财，引起的弊病之多，使得联合国委员会在报告中也不得不承认，这种办法严重地危害了整个赋税制度。
    关于这种事实，艾奇逊先生觉得还是一字不提为妙，因为就连联合国委员会也已指出的这种事实，一定会揭穿美国国务卿艾奇逊先生在这里给我们讲的朝鲜历史全是虚构。这种事实势必会使得艾奇逊先生无法颂赞李承晚政权，也更无法掩饰这个在美国当局卵翼下发展起来的政权所给予南朝鲜人民的灾难。李承晚法西斯政权遭到人民反抗
    联合国委员会的“报告”欲盖弥彰
    如果除了上述情况之外，我们再指出李承晚政权为了镇压人民一切民主愿望的表现所采取的种种可耻的残酷措施，那么整个政治腐败的情况就清清楚楚地摆在大家眼前，用不着再加以任何特别说明了。
    艾奇逊先生显然很满意南朝鲜的政治制度。即使联合国朝鲜委员会这样驯从的工具，想尽办法来冲淡狰狞的景色，也没有办法掩盖那些充分暴露李承晚政权是一个残暴的反动政权，是一个道地的法西斯政权的事实。例如，联合国朝鲜委员会向第五届联合国大会提出的报告也不能否认，在一九五○年四月和五月的竞选运动期间，大约有二百名具有民主思想的选民因为被怀疑是南朝鲜劳动党的党员或支持和同情这个党而被逮捕，而南朝鲜劳动党是根据在美国当局批准下公布实行的臭名昭彰的国家保安法而被查禁的。
    联合国朝鲜委员会的报告说：“候选人的许多支持者受到警官和其他身份不明的人的恫吓甚至被殴打，其用意是要吓倒他们。……退出选举的情事发生了不少，足以说明有着使用压力的事。”某些逮捕事件是明明违反选举法第一百一十七条的。
    为了说明这个联合国委员会的本质，应该指出，这个委员会虽然指出了严重违反选举法和侵犯基本民主权利与自由的情事，然而最后却说，选举的组织工作值得赞扬，还说当局并没有非法干涉竞选运动。这真是很妙的叫人为难的事情！
    自那以后，情况不但没有改变，而且愈来愈糟，愈来愈严重了。
    联合国委员会向第七届大会提出的报告（A—二一八七号报告）里就有不少事实说明，在南朝鲜，李承晚政府愈来愈是无法无天，李承晚政府不择手段地迫害一切有民主见解嫌疑的人。
    甚至南朝鲜的所谓国民议会也开始反对李承晚了！
    报告俄文本第十八页说，渐渐地，国民议会的许多议员也都非常不满总统独揽大权的统治，他们都认为总统专权，独行其是，所以他们开始拒绝拥护修改宪法，除非能够行使他们的选举权利，选举别的人当总统，而不再选李承晚。李承晚和国民议会之间便展开了一场激烈的斗争。
    一九五二年五月，李承晚在釜山实行戒严法，第二天国民议会全部一百八十三名议员中，就有五十多人被逮捕，另外一部分议员害怕被捕，都躲了起来。结果，据委员会的报告说，国民议会因不足法定人数而不能召开。看到国民议会的议员不去出席议会的会议，警察便奉李承晚的命令强行把议员们带到国民议会，把他们锁在会议厅里，强迫他们通过李承晚所希望通过的决定。
    要总结南朝鲜形势的特点，只要看一看那个联合国朝鲜委员会的报告就行了。尽管这个委员会力图掩饰李承晚政权穷凶极恶的罪行，但是它暴露了这个政权已经把南朝鲜人民驱入了怎样的水深火热的境地。他们是怎样的痛恨李承晚集团及其主子的统治。要想对这一点获得一个概念，只要看一看联合国委员会报告中谈到一九五○年十二月在洪家里（译音）和居昌（译音）发生的大批枪杀的那一部分就够了。从南朝鲜当局自己的正式报告中就可以看到，在一九五○年十月一日到十二月十五日之间，就有三百九十一人因有不满李承晚政府的嫌疑和同情游击队的嫌疑而被判处死刑。从这个报告中可以看到，被处决的人中间有年轻的男子和妇女。
    鉴于上述情况，我们不可能不提到这个名叫联合国委员会的委员会的可耻行为。这个委员会看到李承晚政府执行的凶恶的处决和大批枪杀后，竟把李承晚政府打算在将来各别地而不是成批地处决的决定称为“慈悲行为”！
    在这一方面，这样提明一下不会是多余的，就是说，这个报告是澳大利亚、荷兰、巴基斯坦、泰国、土耳其、菲律宾、智利的代表组成的委员会提出的。
    报告中说，在朝鲜东南部居昌附近的神院面村（译音），有许多居民在一九五一年被控与游击队合作并协助游击队，而按照军事法庭的判决被处决。按报告中所说，事情开始于一九五○年六月，当时南朝鲜警察数度企图毁灭这个村庄而未果。一直到一九五一年二月，一营南朝鲜军队和警察派遣队进攻这个村庄，但是遭到数百名武装齐备的游击队的抵抗，这些游击队有五百名没有武装的游击队和村民的支援。战斗继续了十个小时。报告说，村民都协助游击队。他们在谷仓中和住家中为游击队准备了隐藏的所在。
    报告又说，村民和共产党员已经正式地结合起来了。在战斗中，村民拒绝警察要求，不给他们食物，却把食物给游击队，表示他们的同情。报告说，所有这些事实毫无疑问地表明了：村民与共产党游击队保持合作，这是军队的军事活动的一大障碍。军警因当地村民这种态度而激怒，便继续猛攻，杀死了大约二百名共产党员，其中包括曾与游击队合作的村民。
    南朝鲜讨伐军的营长和居昌（Kuhchan译音）警察局侦缉队队长对这种野蛮镇压，还不满足，更就地枪杀了新吴村（Shinwuk    Village译音）一百八十七名居民。
    手无寸铁的居昌农民竟与企图杀戮数百名游击队的李承晚宪警进行这样英勇的斗争，李承晚警察又承认村民与游击队之间通力合作，情谊深厚，这都生动地证明了：在南朝鲜反对李承晚政权的斗争是在广大人民群众之中有深深的根源的。
    南朝鲜游击队运动是南朝鲜广泛的人民大众反对李承晚政权、反对支持这个政权的美国军事当局的结果。
    法西斯李承晚政权依靠强大的外国主子的支持，对于任何稍有进步民主思想的人民极尽残酷迫害之能事。联合国委员会的报告承认：有些人在被逮捕之后，又遭到严刑拷问，同时朝鲜公民时常仅仅由于胆敢批评美国人而遭到逮捕。
    那么，这样一种情况引起了人民的普遍不满，与南朝鲜游击运动的开展，难道还有什么可奇怪的吗？这对于进攻北朝鲜的准备工作势必是一个严重的障碍。
    艾奇逊先生说，北朝鲜共产党活动的目的是要破坏南朝鲜政府。事实上，没有任何事情能够像南朝鲜政府所实行的公开与人民为敌的、野蛮的、惨无人道的反动政策那样破坏南朝鲜政府的威信。
    在美国的指使和支持下李承晚匪帮挑起罪恶战争
    艾奇逊先生在攻击北朝鲜政府的时候，竟然说：北朝鲜人提出的和平统一朝鲜的建议是一种侵略行动……。
    一个人只有在神经极度错乱的情况下才会从和平建议中看出侵略阴谋来！
    但是，大家来分析一下吧，为什么艾奇逊先生对李承晚和其它南朝鲜政治领袖的截然相反的、公开叫嚣战争的谈话若无其事呢？我们来看看这些先生们在他们对北朝鲜发动进攻以前不久说些什么吧。在这方面，委员会提交联合国第五届大会的一九四九年度的报告说：“然而，委员会时常注意到总统，外务部长官和其他重要的、有权势的政界人士的谈话，这些谈话表示，时间日益紧迫，到了迫不得已的时候，可能采取最后手段，使用武力来统一。”例如，在联合国大会承认大韩民国政府一周年纪念之际，外务部长官表示“希望人民尽最大努力来取消三八线，俾在明年十二月十二日以前，完成朝鲜的全国统一。有鉴于此，人民应该下定坚定的决心，从此以后准备流血”。总统李承晚同样在一九四九年十二月三十日记者招待会上说：“我们必须在明年完成统一，我相信我们能够办到……为了与联合国合作，我们一直诚意地保持着耐心的态度。我们将继续努力通过朝鲜人民的互相了解来求得重新统一。但是一旦不可避免的时间到来，很可能我们不能避免流血和内战。假如不幸我们今年不能得到统一，那么我们就要被迫自己来统一我们的领土了。”
    一九五○年二月，南朝鲜国防部长官申性模公开地说：“如果联合国拔不掉朝鲜身上的‘匕首’，这是它始终没有做到的一件事，那么，朝鲜人民自己就必须用自己的努力与力量来这样做了。”
    如果艾奇逊先生还没有时间正确地研究朝鲜委员会的报告，那么，也许他现在可以用几小时的时间来看一看这些话。想一想这些话是什么意思。这样，也可以帮助他了解一九五○年六月二十五日的事件是怎样发生的，为什么发生的。
    艾奇逊先生在演说中特别用一部分时间来企图的证明朝鲜境内的侵略行为是由北朝鲜准备和进行。艾奇逊先生把事情说得好像这一行动是在南朝鲜政府击溃了艾奇逊先生所谓由北方侵入的共产党以后，在它把国内的一次叛乱镇压下去以后，并且在那种被艾奇逊先生称之为明智的李承晚政府政策使北朝鲜人的一切阴谋都遭到惨败以后几个星期采取的。艾奇逊先生精确地知道有多少北朝鲜青年在西伯利亚受训，朝鲜劳动党怎样在一九四九年夏天进行了他所说的清党并把南朝鲜劳动党暗中吃掉；他知道北朝鲜——我是引用艾奇逊先生的话——怎样组织了一支强大的军队，这支军队又是怎样教育、训练和优良地装备起来的，而且，苏联政府又怎样向它提供战略与战术上的建议；最后，他还知道全体北朝鲜平民怎样受基本军事训练。艾奇逊先生由北朝鲜的逃亡者和北朝鲜境内的联合国工作人员这一类的情报员那里——艾奇逊自己这样承认——把这种情况了解得详细极了。
    但是，南朝鲜在这个时期里采取了一些什么军事措施呢？艾奇逊先生却一无所知，只知道南朝鲜军队完全没有进攻的准备，只是为了防御而驻守各地。但是，这种说法与那种比由逃亡者口中得到的情报更加真实可靠的情报，那种熟悉这种问题的人所报告的消息是完全不同的。我要引美国经合总署朝鲜分署署长琼逊所说的一段话来证明。琼逊在一九五○年五月十九日在美国众议院拨款委员会上说：以美国武器装备起来的、在汉城美国军事顾问团指导下由美国军官训练出来的十万名南朝鲜军队，已经完成了准备工作，可以随时发动战争。
    这个声明与艾奇逊先生的说法是矛盾的，艾奇逊先生在他的演说里说：南朝鲜的十万军队并不是武装起来作进攻之用的。
    艾奇逊先生对于所谓北朝鲜的“侵略”证据，又加添了某些文件，其中有所谓落到联合国军手中的进攻南朝鲜的计划，据说这项计划现在由联合国保存着。这件事倒是值得详细谈一谈的。
    三八线地区的一切武装冲突事件都是南朝鲜挑起来的。在一九四九年六月以前，这种事件大多是对北朝鲜境内开枪射击的事件，从六月起，南朝鲜军就开始侵犯三八线，它们以整个的部队越过三八线，目的在于占领北朝鲜境内的防线，这种行动就引起了武装冲突。
    从一九四九年六月至八月，南朝鲜所侵犯的主要地区是瓮津、开城、襄阳。
    在瓮津地区，南朝鲜警察屡次侵犯三八线，时常占据北朝鲜境内的高地。
    一九四九年六月，南朝鲜调集了七个配有迫击炮的步兵营和一个炮兵营，发动进攻，目的在于占据北朝鲜境内的有利阵地。这个战斗连续进行了两个月，其中仅有短时间的停歇。
    六月二十七日，一营南朝鲜军占据了二八八点○高地；七月十九日，南朝鲜军占据了一一二点○、一三一点七、一二三点○等高地（最远的到三八线以北一公里）。
    八月四日，北朝鲜收复了他们的阵地，并且把敌人赶出了北朝鲜领土。
    在开城地区，战争自一九四九年七月二十二日进行至八月一日。七月二十五日，南朝鲜军一营在密集的炮轰之后，攻击并占据了三八线以北的四八八点二高地。战斗从一九四九年七月二十八日进行至八月一日，结果南朝鲜部队被驱逐出北朝鲜领土。
    南朝鲜军在开城地区发动攻势的过程中，使用了大量的大炮和迫击炮。七月二十八日那一天，南朝鲜军发射了三千五百多发榴弹炮弹和一千多发迫击炮弹。
    除此以外，南朝鲜还在其他地方侵犯三八线，如在东海岸的襄阳地区。七月二十八日，南朝鲜在这个地区派遣了两个破坏工作队共一百五十六人偷过三八线，去截断元山和襄阳地区北朝鲜军的退路；七月五日和六日，南朝鲜军约一个步兵营占据了英德里（译音）和公须田里，即进入三八线以北四·五公里；南朝鲜军约一个营占据了其土门里（三八线以北一公里）一带的高地。我想提醒一下，侵略朝鲜的问题早在一九五○年的第五届大会上就被提出来了，那时美国代表团力图否认美国在李承晚政府的参加下侵略朝鲜这回事。
    甚至在那个时候，这种企图就完全失败了。苏联代表团提出的证据揭穿了美国诬指北朝鲜政府进行侵略来掩饰自己的侵略行为的阴谋诡计。我们在那时候就已指明了：李承晚政府和它的美国朋友是如何准备好进攻北朝鲜的，提出了直到今天都无法否认的、无可反驳的证据。李承晚在这种准备工作中起了重要的作用，这一点从他在一九四九年九月三十日写给美国奥利伏教授的一封信就可以明显看出来。我那时就引证了他的信。奥利伏教授证实了他曾接到这样一封信，李承晚在这封信里说：“现在（指一九四九年九月）是采取进攻性的步骤、并团结北朝鲜共军中效忠于我们的那一部分人以便将其余的一部分歼灭的心理上最有利的时机。”
    李承晚在信中对奥利伏教授说：“我们将要把金日成手下的一部分人赶到山里去，让他们在那儿饿死。”
    他对奥利伏博士肯定地说，奥利伏和他的朋友们应该不动声色地在华盛顿和纽约工作，而李承晚自己则在汉城和东京为同一目标——“肃清全国并清理我们的家务”而努力。
    南朝鲜驻美大使赵炳玉也在这方面作了许多努力，他在一九四九年十月写信给李承晚说：他很用心而且很有兴趣地读了李承晚写给奥利伏的关于“消灭北朝鲜傀儡政权”的那封信。
    赵炳玉写道：“我与张大使和奥利伏博士讨论过这个问题，我们一致得出这样的结论：这个计划必须当作我国政府的基本计划，必须在我们准备妥当和恰好的时机来临的时候予以实现。”
    赵炳玉在一九四九年十一月给李承晚的一封信中指出，只有通过政府的主权才能实现朝鲜的统一，并说李承晚政府最重要的任务就是加强南朝鲜的军事和经济方面的准备。
    李承晚在一九四九年十二月三十日公然宣称，他有决心在新的一年（即一九五○年）收复失地——他的意思就是夺取北朝鲜。他又公然提出警告说：南朝鲜人在将来不会实行和平政策，他并嘱南朝鲜人必须记住：在新的一年中由于国际情势的变化，他们（指李承晚分子）必须用“我们自己的努力”统一南北朝鲜。
    这当然是很明白的：如果不是美国统治集团支持他们的侵略意图，李承晚和他的走狗们是不敢这样公然讲出他们进攻北朝鲜的计划的。
    在这个期间，美国国防部长詹逊、美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷、国务院顾问杜勒斯抵达远东，并与麦克阿瑟将军举行了一次秘密会议。大家知道，杜勒斯在南朝鲜武装部队于六月二十五日进攻北朝鲜那天以前十一天曾到南朝鲜视察预定的前线及战壕。杜勒斯于六月十九日在南朝鲜国民议会中发表演说，同意李承晚向北朝鲜进行武装冒险的计划，他说：美国将给予南朝鲜一切必要的道义的和物质的支持，向共产主义作战。
    杜勒斯在一九五○年六月二十日，即向北朝鲜进攻的前五天，曾写信给李承晚说：他异常重视李承晚的国家在即将演出的伟大戏剧中所扮演的决定性的角色。
    到目前为止，我们还没有听到杜勒斯对这句话的意义作过任何解释。在那时候，我们对杜勒斯指出这句话，并严重地指责这是挑动朝鲜战争的行为。这个指责迄今没有被反驳。
    在那时候，艾奇逊先生对于这件事没有讲过话，但是，他现在却决定讲话了，这显然是想在选民代表面前挽回他的面子。但是他这样一来倒使我们得以就联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会的报告来谈一谈所有这些重要问题；检查一下这些问题可以使朝鲜事件的真相大白于天下。早在一九五零年一月，罗伯茨将军曾对李承晚政府的长官发布训令说，进攻北朝鲜的计划已经决定。罗伯茨警告说，虽然南朝鲜可以自己开始进攻，但仍必须制造一个藉口，俾得有一个正当理由。他并说，联合国委员会对这件事可以及时地向联合国提出一项符合于这种情况的报告。在那时候，进攻北朝鲜的计划早已准备好了。
    另外还有许多同样重要的证据，说明李承晚军队曾在准备进攻北朝鲜。这些材料中最重要的是从李承晚政府的秘密档案中找到的一张战略地图，这张地图现在北朝鲜政府手中。
    在第五届大会上，我曾详细地说明这张地图的内容，在这张地图上，南朝鲜军队从黄海海岸至高浪浦地区以及从高浪浦至东海岸地区发动进攻。主要的进攻方向都在地图上标明。海军从汉川登陆向平壤进攻的路线也在地图上标明，从东豆川、春川、寒峙和其他地方进攻的方向也标明着。
    这些都是无法争辩的事实，都是在美国指导之下的南朝鲜事先计划好、组织好向北朝鲜进攻的不可争辩的证据，这次进攻是由美国武装力量事先准备和事后支持的。
    一九五○年安理会的非法决定是美国掩饰其侵略罪行的把戏
    艾奇逊先生在这里所说的关于北朝鲜进攻的一切话是不值得任何考虑的。南朝鲜发动侵略的不可争辩的事实，没有一点被证明是不真实的：国务院没有提出一点证据来证实它自己的说法。国务院的先生们所能做出的唯一的事情，就是使用陈腔滥调，作无意义的谩骂。他们似乎认为没有责任要作任何证明。他们机械地一再说北朝鲜发动侵略，他们引用安全理事会六月二十五日的决议，这决议武断地说北朝鲜军队向南朝鲜进攻。这个决议的来源是值得更详细研究的。
    的确，安全理事会根据什么资料通过这个决议？六月二十五日发生的事情真相究竟如何？安全理事会理事国对于他们武断地用作他们决议根据的事实的真实性可能有多少把握？
    大家知道，安全理事会关于南北朝鲜交界处冲突事件情报的第一个来源是南朝鲜政府，南朝鲜政府诬指北朝鲜武装部队曾攻击瓮津半岛的某几处地方，并在江尼（译音）南北登陆，向汉城方向进攻。
    值得注意的是：在六月二十五日的会议上，赖伊本着他所接到的李承晚政府的报告的精神，报告这件事情，他提到他所接到的这个报告和他从朝鲜其他来源所得到的情报。他硬说这种报告和情报都清楚地证明冲突是北朝鲜军队挑起的。一九五零年六月二十五日联合国朝鲜委员会拍给秘书处的电报也只包括上述李承晚政府的报告，李承晚政府是敌视北朝鲜政府的。那时候，联合国朝鲜委员会本身没有关于南北朝鲜交界处情况的情报，它所有的情报只是美国驻联合国代表葛罗斯提出的朝鲜政府的电报内所提供的情报和他从美国驻朝鲜大使缪锡俄那里得到的情报，而缪锡俄的情报也是从李承晚那里得来的。
    此外，委员会的观察员在沿边界巡行后于一九五○年六月二十三日返回汉城，在委员会会议上报告了此行经过，这次会议于一九五○年六月二十六日便在汉城召开。委员会在这以后才向联合国发出电报。
    从委员会的报告中可以看出，委员会所得到的关于三八线上的事件的情报，来源是南朝鲜的内务部长官和美国驻南朝鲜大使缪锡俄。也就是这个缪锡俄在一九四九年七月下半月与罗伯茨将军及南朝鲜的长官申性模、权承烈、金孝锡举行会议，并告诉他们，在七、八月间必须进行大规模准备工作，准备进攻北方。至于委员会的观察员们，当事件发生的时候，他们都不在三八线，他们所报告的三八线的情况都只能追溯到他们在三八线地区逗留的最后一天六月二十二日，即敌对行动开始的前三天。
    无怪乎当时安全理事会的一位代表指出，所获得的情报是矛盾的，不够清楚，因此不可以在没有听取北朝鲜政府陈述意见以前就片面采取任何决定。这位代表对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的敌对态度是人所共知的，但是他也不得不说明过去和现在的事实真相。
    这些事实足以无可辩驳地证明安全理事会对于一九五○年六月二十五日黎明在朝鲜发生的事件并没有从公正来源方面得到客观情报，因此，安全理事会没有任何权利断言北朝鲜的军队首先侵犯南朝鲜，也没有任何权利在这一方面采取决定。但是安全理事会在别人的压力下，主要是在美国的压力下，立即采取了一个决定，而现在竟有些人企图把这个决定说成是可以真实地答复朝鲜的侵略怎样开始和谁是真正的侵略者的问题的一个决定。
    但是真相终会水落石出。现在越来越坚决、越来越宏亮的声音清楚地揭露了安全理事会一九五○年六月二十五日的决定是不正确的；越来越多的问题提了出来，坚决要求答复，不答复这些问题，你就不能再希望安安稳稳地欺骗舆论了。
    在这些事实面前，艾奇逊先生关于联合国委员会——它当时公正的程度正像今日公正的程度一样——所宣布的判决的传奇似的论调，就显得非常荒谬了。但是这些话是不是真心诚意的话呢？艾奇逊说：这是一个公正的判决。但是，是不是有不说明充分理由的那种公正判决呢？是不是有不听取被告的意见、也不听取他的说明而宣布被告败诉的那种公正判决呢？这就是你所谓的公正的判决！
    判决一字表示审判官和负责决定法律案件的正直人士的意见。对这个崇高的字眼——判决——加以如此的亵渎和滥用是不能容许的。联合国委员会或安全理事会所宣布的决不能算是公正的判决，因为要宣布一项真正公正的判决，必须先进行忠实与客观的调查，如果没有忠实与客观的调查，不论各种法律人员叫嚷得多么厉害，没有一项判决能够看做是公正的。六月二十五日、六月二十七日及七月七日安全理事会中发生的每一件事都是在美国指挥下串演的一幕笑剧。美国许多年来一直阻挠朝鲜的和平统一，有计划地鼓励李承晚政府与李承晚本人的好战的计划，要为朝鲜准备一个血腥结局。
    在安全理事会于六月二十五日在不合法的组成状况下采取了决定后，什么事都沿着一个方向循环——“北朝鲜开始侵略”，“北朝鲜开始侵略”，“北朝鲜开始侵略”……但有什么事实呢？安全理事会并没有事实。安全理事会是根据南朝鲜政府一封歪曲事实的电报采取决定的。但我们确信，总有一天南朝鲜进攻北朝鲜的秘密会被完全揭露出来，比今天可能揭露的程度还要彻底。这个秘密今天已经可以称之为滑稽的秘密，事实上早就成为一个公开的秘密了。
    从这些事实来看，艾奇逊先生在两年半以后又企图回到在朝鲜的侵略从什么方面发动的问题上，这种企图必须予以坚决反对，必须认为这种企图是没有成功机会的。
    朝鲜战争不是偶然发生的。朝鲜战争是美国资本家所需要的。美国资本家以惊惶恐惧的心情看到行将到来的经济危机的迹象，因此把很大的希望寄托在一个相当新鲜的刺激上面，以此来支撑衰微中的美国经济。这种刺激就采取了朝鲜战争的形式。这个战争给千千万万的人民带来了恐怖和死亡，而却给制造死亡的商人源源不断地带来了战争订货和巨额利润。
    朝鲜干涉的组织者与鼓动者不止一次地承认过，如果战争没有在朝鲜爆发，它一定会在别的地方爆发。
    联合国军陆军司令范佛里特曾对一个访问他的菲律宾官员代表团说：某种朝鲜战争是不能不发生的，不是在那里发生，就是在地球上的其他地方发生。
    这就是朝鲜战争的根源，这就是它的来源，这就是法律学家与讼师的漂亮辞藻所不能消灭的事实。
    朝中方面排除美方无理阻挠促使停战协定草案达成协议
    艾奇逊硬说：美军司令部在停战谈判中的唯一目标是获得最大限度的防止侵略再起的保证。但是，美军司令部在这种谈判里实际采取的态度完全与此相反。
    事实如下：
    一、例如，艾奇逊曾经说过：为了达到这一目的，必须防止军队的兵力在轮换人员的时候有所增加。这个建议并未遭到朝中司令部方面的任何反对，然而后者提出一个完全正当的要求，就是，要提供条件来防止在这件事情上胡作非为，防止对方以轮换人员为藉口而在实际上增加武装部队兵力的可能性。正是因为这个缘故，朝中方面才提出限制轮换的人员不得超过五千人的要求，而美军司令部则坚持不超过七万五千人。美军司令部对这个要求十分坚持，所以，为了避免在这个问题上造成僵局，朝中司令部同意每方轮换军人的数目增加到三万五千。这样，人民朝鲜方面就作了很大的让步。
    二、美军司令部坚持要求有权在一个所谓公正的委员会的帮助下，监督在朝中方面后方发生的事情。虽然是通过所谓公正的委员会，这也显然是对北朝鲜内政的干涉，当然，这不能看做是防止可能的侵略的保证，相反的，这只能促使新事件爆发，而造成各种各样的军事后果。
    三、美军司令部在分界线上争论了一个很长的时间，他们力图使分界线沿着一个在战略上对美国最有利的方向延伸，并力图保持他们早先占领的地区。美军司令部提出了一个荒谬的要求：在划定分界线时，要把北朝鲜领土的很大一部分交给他们，他们还假惺惺地说什么“联合国军代表团”所以坚持它的建议，并不是因为它对于扩张“联合国军”控制的领土感到兴趣，而是因为“联合国军司令部”必须取得三八线区域所缺乏的方便的防线。如果接受这个要求的话，一万三千平方公里面积的土地，即全朝鲜领土的二十分之一就要归美军司令部控制了。
    他们坚持分界线扩大至三八线以北八公里，特别指明要划在开城以北的朝鲜东海岸。至于瓮津半岛南部，他们愿意割让给朝鲜民主主义人民共和国；美国谈判代表霍治说，这块地方让给任何人都对他们没有关系，让给阿比西尼亚也好，让给澳大利亚也好。
    四、美军司令部在同意海空停战方面要求北朝鲜割让某一部分领土作为补偿。
    所有这些美国的要求都明显地说明美军司令部对分界线问题争执不休的真正目的，也说明为什么这种争执延续到将近一个月之久。
    艾奇逊对于开城中立区完全由南朝鲜和美国军队有计划地进行的军事挑衅行动，一言不发，这种挑衅行动包括向插有白旗的朝中代表团乘坐的汽车进行扫射，用机枪扫射中立区边界的板门店岗哨，美国飞机向朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军代表团居住的地区投掷油桶和炸弹，并炮轰会场区。仅仅在八天时间内（一九五一年八月二十三日至三十日），美国飞机侵犯开城中立区上空达十二次之多，在九月一日甚至在南日将军住宅附近投掷炸弹。在九月的第一个星期内，美国飞机曾侵入开城中立地区上空达一百次之多，向谈判会场进行射击。在这种情况下，要保持冷静并表示愿意就美军司令部故意使之恶化的各种问题达成协议，那是需要很好的自制能力的。
    尽管这样，朝鲜和中国方面终于能够解除了许多阻碍停战谈判获致协议的藉口。由于朝中方面的这种灵活的、热爱和平的、诚恳的作法，终于使停战协定草案的六十多项条款获得了协议。
    美方提出荒谬的“自愿遣返”建议造成遣俘问题日趋尖锐化的局面
    但是，仍然有一个重要问题没有获致协议，而且这个问题现在已经的确变得非常尖锐了。这个问题就是交换战俘问题。这个问题异常重大，是值得比较仔细地来考虑一下的，尤其是因为美国代表团企图像过去许多次一样，在这次大会上提出美军司令部违反国际法各种基本原则的、使人完全不能接受的立场，把它当作联合国的意见。
    战俘问题并不是像艾奇逊先生在此间所说完全出乎美国的意料之外的。实际上，这个问题从一开始就被列入了开城停战谈判的议程。
    我不打算作详细的说明，我只谈一谈交换战俘谈判的几个最重要的阶段。
    在一九五一年十二月十二日，朝中方面对这个问题提出了如下的建议：
    双方释放现在收容的全部战俘；在停战协定签字后最短可能的期间内，双方分批释放及遣送完毕其所收容的全部战俘，并确定重伤、重病战俘应先在第一批内释放及遣送的原则；在停战委员会下，双方各派同等数目人员组成遣俘委员会；上述各项一经双方同意确定后，即行交换双方现有全部战俘名单。
    美方不但不就这些建议的内容提出答复，反而以最后通牒方式要求朝中方面提出关于战俘的情报，并要求准许所谓红十字国际委员会代表访问战俘营，事实上拒绝在这种情报提出以前讨论朝中方面的建议。
    朝中方面提供了关于一万一千五百五十九名战俘的必要情报，美国代表团方面提供了十三万二千四百七十四名朝中战俘的名单，但是美方以前给红十字国际委员会的名单上列有十七万六千六百七十名战俘。
    艾奇逊说，有三万七千人经“重新分类”后加以释放，因为发觉他们并非战俘，而是平民。
    结果美军司令部以同样的方法对另外一万一千人加以“重新分类”。
    朝中方面要求美方代表团交待那一千四百五十六名曾经被算在十二月十八日战俘总数内，而在后来的名单上却无名字的战俘的下落，以及那四万四千二百零五名曾包括在美国通过红十字国际委员会所提出的名单内，而在一九五○年十二月十八日名单上未曾提及的战俘的下落。美方说：关于这四万四千名战俘的材料已是过时的了，这些战俘已被释放，但是后来美方又不得不承认这批人是在美国的俘虏营内，然而却硬说他们是被强迫加入朝鲜军的平民而且是南朝鲜当地的人，所以没有把他们列入十二月十八日所提出的名单上。
    一九五一年十二月三十一日，美方代表团答应最迟在一月二日提出关于战俘的全部材料，在一月三日它又重申它的保证，然而终归没有提出任何材料。
    一月十二日，美方说在没有达成停战协定以前，完全没有必要提出关于战俘的材料；一月十五日，美方宣称它将提出基本材料来交换朝中方面关于南朝鲜战俘的补充材料，然而在一月十八日，它又说这些材料不是基本材料，不会包括关于四万四千二百零五名战俘的情况在内。
    最后在一九五二年一月二十八日，美方才提出了情报，但是里面仅仅提到十三万二千四百七十四名战俘。
    现在艾奇逊先生却说：在美方战俘营里一共只有朝中战俘十二万一千人。我们绝不可忽略这样一个事实，那是李奇微总部在一九五一年十二月三十一日所承认的，就是在战争初期被俘的十四万战俘里面已有七千人左右死于美方战俘营。
    所有这一切当然只能对谈判的进展发生最不利的影响。
    此外，美方提出的某些要求和建议也同样地发生不利的影响。例如美方曾要求在一对一的基础上交换战俘，并曾建议叫所谓红十字国际委员会负责确定希望遣返的战俘是否由于受到胁迫才做出这种决定。
    这简直是荒谬已极了！人们自己说要求遣返，但是却凭空跑出一个特别委员会来确定他们是真想遣返呢还是由于受到胁迫才作出这样的决定。美军司令部另外的一个建议也是这种性质的。他们建议：所有在一九五零年六月二十五日以前曾是南朝鲜或北朝鲜平民的朝鲜战俘应一律视为平民。假使这个建议被接受的话，那么就会有六万多名朝鲜战俘被算作平民的名单之内。
    可以说这就是所有这些非法建议后面的狡黠诡计！
    朝中方面自然坚决拒绝了美方这种非法要求。这种要求的用意完全是想扣留十六万五千名战俘——朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的战士——以及数十万被强迫迁移的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的平民，其目的显然是要把这些战俘交给蒋介石和李承晚摆布。
    后来双方决定把战俘问题提交双方参谋人员讨论，在他们开始他们的工作的时候，美方再度提出所谓自愿遣返的建议。以后美方就一直不断地提出这种要求，而且从后来的事实看来，这种要求已成为美方代表团用来继续施行压力的工具，以便达到一种与获致停战协议的目标完全相反的目的。
    在三月二十一日朝中方面又作了一次努力，争取在战俘问题上达成协议。他们建议：在停战协定签字之后，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军将把他们所拘留的一万一千五百名战俘全部释放和遣返，美方则应释放和遣返他们所拘留的十三万二千四百七十四名战俘，至于双方战俘名单则由双方参谋人员予以最后校正。美方代表团在三月二十五日声称：朝中方面这个建议只要经过某些修正就可以成为解决这个问题的基础。停战谈判可能圆满结束的希望再一次出现了。
    美国方面既在原则上同意，于是朝中代表团提出了具体建议，规定任何一方收容的非朝鲜籍战俘及住所不在被收容一方所管辖地区的朝鲜籍战俘都须全部遣返，但住所在被收容一方的朝鲜战俘，如果他们愿意回家过和平生活则毋须遣返。
    一九五二年七月、八月、九月三个月都在讨论战俘问题；双方对停战协定草案的第五十一条和第五十二条于七月四日达成协议。
    大家知道，第五十一条规定在停战协定生效时，双方应释放并尽早遣返所收容的全部战俘，释放的战俘应以本段中提及的双方交换的名单为依据，这种名单应在停战协定签字前经双方校正。第五十二条规定所有战俘不许再参加战争行动，必须重新从事和平职业。
    后来，美国代表团说，他们只同意遣返八万三千名朝中战俘，这表示他们打算扣留一大部分被俘的朝鲜人和中国人。朝中代表团于是说，这个建议违反已经协议的停战协定草案中第五十一条和第五十二条的原则，因而拒绝了美国的建议。美国代表然后说：他们的建议是坚定的、不可更改的，并拒绝讨论这个问题的内容。
    值得注意的是：美国代表团曾于一九五二年二月五日用下列方式提出第五十二条：双方在目前的停战协定生效后尽早释放其收容的一切战俘。按照这个方法释放的一切战俘应遣送或移交给对方，但不得实行强迫遣返或强迫移交。为了达到强迫扣留的可耻目的美军当局不断虐杀朝中被俘人员    后来的发展证明：实际上，美军司令部曾采取了强迫扣留战俘的措施。美军司令部花了许多个月的时间在各战俘营中实行一套办法，以威吓战俘，使他们拒绝遣返。美军司令部任命李承晚和蒋介石的特务在各战俘营中担任重要职务，他们在美军司令部的命令下，在这些战俘营中进行各种暴行。关于这一事，必须追述：被俘的朝鲜人和中国人曾被在身上刺字，并且被迫写血书，凡拒绝这样做的人不是遭到殴打，便被杀害。
    所有这些暴行都是为了逼迫受拷打与酷刑的战俘表示他们拒绝回家。
    同时，在谈判过程中，美国代表继续坚决主张重新询问与甄别战俘。
    单单安排这种重新询问的事实就说明：原先的询问都是虚构的，它们不能取得任何人的信任。否则，为什么还需要重新询问呢？不论这些重新的询问采取什么方式与程序，安排重新询问的事实就是对国际法基本准则的最横暴的破坏与嘲弄。
    我们可以列举许多无可置驳的事实来证明：被美国拘禁的朝中战士受到了非人道的待遇；独立与自由的报纸都刊载了关于这些事实的报道，连美国人自己与他们大事渲染的所谓红十字国际委员会也证实了这些事实。让我来仅仅提一下这些事实中的几件事实吧。
    一九五二年二月与三月在巨济岛上发生的血腥暴行清楚地揭露了美国战俘营中实行的不堪忍受的统治。红十字国际委员会的报告中包含了巨济岛战俘营长官费兹吉拉德上校提供的关于二月十八日事件的情报。这就是那位上校描述的二月十八日事件的经过：
    在接到总部要战俘与被拘平民亲自用秘密投票方式来表明他们是否愿意重新甄别的指示后，第六十二号营场中的战俘就拒绝办理这种手续。在这种情况下，战俘营当局把这个问题加以彻底讨论后，就决定用军队来把战俘分成小组。费兹吉拉德说：要达到这个目的的计划就草拟出来、得到批准，并付诸实施了。
    这意味着什么呢？他们要询问人们他们是否希望遣返。
    为了进行这种询问，他们就把战俘分成小组。当然，可以显然看出：这是警察常常使用的手段，其目的是要把一群团结在一起的人民冲散成孤立的个人，以便比较容易地对付不满分子，比较容易地迫使他们同意不回家。单单这一事实就足以充分地说明：所有这些行为都是为了强使俘虏在手枪和机关枪的威吓下同意宪兵和军事当局的要求。这是战俘营长官费兹吉拉德上校所供认的。
    情况就是这样。在这种情况下，我们能够同意这些可耻的措施具有艾奇逊先生在这里大吹特吹的人道目的吗？我们能够同意艾奇逊先生所谓这些措施都是为了使战俘免遭他们首领的毒手的说法吗？屠杀战俘是为了保护他们，这就是艾奇逊的公式。
    下面是费兹吉拉德说过的另外一些话。他说：营场里布置了岗哨，战俘被分成小组。一切都很顺利，但是，后来这个营场里有很多的共产党挑拨分子鼓动一营战俘攻击联合国军士兵。
    所有的俘虏都拿着铁条、木棒和用铁丝网制成的代用武器。大块石头和自造手榴弹开始投掷到士兵身上。军队于是被迫采取决定性的自卫措施来击退进攻。
    在示威的整个过程中，共产党的旗帜飘扬，所有事实都说明攻击的目的是在赶走联合国军。
    费兹吉拉德说，俘虏进行攻击的时候他不在场，因为在计划的第一部分完成以后，他就离开了那个营场。
    当他回到那个营场的时候，他得悉事件经过，进行了调查，结果认为当时不可能完成任务。因此他下令军队撤退以避免进一步流血。
    首先值得注意的是：费兹吉拉德上校本人并不是这些事件的目击者，他把这些事件称作是“俘虏的攻击”，而不是正确地说成是美国军队对手无寸铁的战俘的攻击。因此，他的谈话中只有一点是真实的，即艾奇逊先生喜欢叫作“询问”的所谓“甄别”是在美国武器的胁迫下进行的，而在“甄别”以前，战俘们已被强行分成小组，因为这样比较容易对付。
    费兹吉拉德上校的声明与所谓红十字国际委员会代表所提出的情报之间存在着显著的矛盾，而据该委员会的报告说，代表们所提出的情报是第一手的。
    红十字国际委员会的报告是这样说的：二月十八日上午四时左右，约有全副武装的军队一团，未经提出任何警告，即进入营场。
    当时除少数战俘在帐篷内担任警卫以外，大多数战俘都已熟睡。军队包围了其他帐篷，包括尚未能与战俘营当局取得联系的战俘代表所住的帐篷在内。
    战俘在刺刀的威胁下，被迫留在他们的帐篷中。其中有一两个人不知道当时发生的事情，试图走出帐篷，遭到射击。
    战俘们着慌了，他们认为他们将全体被杀，就试图跑出帐篷，进行自卫，并了解一下到底是什么一回事情。军队当即向他们开枪。
    这就是当时的实际情况，并不像费兹吉拉德上校替他手下的刽子手们辩护时所说的那样。
    红十字国际委员会的报告又说：天亮时，战俘的代表再次试图与军队司令官谈判，但未能成功。这个代表也曾试图使战俘们安静下来，但也未能成功。他的一个同志、第三战俘营的领袖协助他设法与司令官取得联系，可是他被击毙了。这时候大约是八点钟，费兹吉拉德上校就在这时候来到出事现场。当着他的面，又有几个唱歌的战俘被枪击。
    这就是屠杀的情况。战俘代表与他的助手战俘第三营的领袖都竭力想防止这场屠杀，但是他们的努力都告失败。第三营领袖被杀害了，唱祖国国歌的战俘被击毙了。
    红十字国际委员会的报告说：在又杀害了几个战俘以后，战俘营长官命令战俘们坐下，被杀的战俘的尸体就躺在他们前面的地上。
    报告继续说：费兹吉拉德上校曾好几次说要把军队撤出，但是他并没有这样做。于是，战俘代表要求费兹吉拉德上校与他一道进行视察，以调查发生的事故。他同意了，就同战俘代表与领袖们一同看到了所造成的破坏情况，并听到一个受伤的战俘大声求援。
    他们走进饭堂，饭堂内全体人员都被看守住了。战俘代表要求释放这些人员，但是他的要求遭到拒绝。他们从饭堂前往厩房所在的地段。他们在路上看到四十名被看守住的战俘，这些战俘都坐在地下，两手抱着他们的头。其中一个战俘已被枪托击伤。战俘代表并不知道战俘营长官是否注意到了这件事。看守的士兵们不让战俘移动尸体和把受伤者送到诊疗所去。他们再走下去，发现帐篷里面还有其它战俘。在战俘代表的请求下，上校下令把他们释放了。他们从帐篷里走出来，遵令坐在地上……
    另外一名军官说，有几个士兵失踪了，于是军官对营场进行了搜查，结果除了发现了几个受伤的战俘以外，一个美国士兵也没有找到。
    战俘代表看见士兵踢死尸。把尸体载上了卡车，却没有经过医生的检验。战俘代表说，其中有一些被当作死尸，其实还没有死。战俘代表和诊疗所里的战俘简直就数不清有多少死尸。在军队撤退以后，战俘代表要求战俘营长官接见他，以讨论所发生的事件。长官说他十点钟回来，但他并没有回来。
    红十字国际委员会代表在他们的报告里说，二月十八日发生事件的巨济岛战俘营第六十二号营场里的战俘是南朝鲜人，但他们是在参加北朝鲜军队作战时被俘的。
    在今年二月八日和九日访问他们的时候，他们说，他们不愿意在停战协定签字后被遣返北朝鲜。他们被认作是南朝鲜公民，并被列入被拘平民一类。
    然而，后来这些战俘中有一部分人要求在停战之后送他们回北朝鲜。因此，战俘营当局决定重新进行甄别，以便确确实实地弄清楚那一些人希望留在南朝鲜，那一些人希望被送回北朝鲜。
    战俘们反对新的甄别。
    红十字国际委员会的代表和战俘谈话的时候，告诉他们说，他们既然已经在一个文件上签了名，表明他们希望被认为南朝鲜人，那么他们改变了意见，就必须在一个新的文件上签名。战俘的领袖说他们不准备受第二次甄别，并且说在第一次甄别中，他们受到强大的压力。
    情况便是这样。即使红十字委员会的报告没有报告一个真正的国际红十字委员会所应该报告的一切，单是根据这个报告的内容，我们也足以说：这便是对美军司令部的判决，这个判决是艾奇逊所不能逃避的，是他不愿声张出来的。也许，艾奇逊先生现在会对这判决有什么话说吧！值得注意的是，这个红十字委员会的报告并没有向第七届联合国大会的代表提出，要是它没有发表在默默无闻的日内瓦“国际红十字评论”的四月号上，也许根本就没有人会知道。这个报告在那里呢？为什么没有把它送交代表们呢？为什么没有任何人知道这个报告呢？为什么要把它隐藏起来呢？谁应该对这件事负责呢？我认为某人是应该答复这些问题的，而且应该要求他来对这个问题加以说明。
    这个报告十分有力地描写出所谓“询问”方法，这种“询问”方法是美国司令部用来“挽救”——艾奇逊先生这样说——朝鲜和中国战俘，使他们免于遭受他们的首领们的专横与报复行动的。
    艾奇逊企图这样说：朝鲜和中国战俘早已决定不答应被遣返，并且也曾坚决反抗过一切要把他们送回家去的企图。但事实似乎是：二月十八日黎明全副武装的美国步兵向巨济岛战俘营进攻，是为了要阻止把战俘移交给朝鲜和中国方面。这一点就不能符合艾奇逊自己所说的话；艾奇逊曾说，他们（美国政府）曾经尽可能仔细地甄别战俘，并竭力鼓励战俘同意遣返。
    艾奇逊恬不知耻地企图为屠杀朝中战俘的行为作辩解，他说：为了恢复秩序和纪律，使用武力是必要的。艾奇逊先生的这种话不会使任何人奇怪，因为人们不会期望那些使用灭绝人性的细菌武器的人、那些一贯地破坏最基本的人类道德和国际公法原则的人对于屠杀手无寸铁的战俘会抱有别种态度。
    美国将军柯尔生的招认
    也证明强迫扣留战俘的罪行
    五月七日，巨济岛上又发生了屠杀朝中战俘的惨剧，这不是偶然事件。柯尔生将军供认：甚至在这些事件以前，战俘营里就发生过流血事件，许多战俘被联合国军队杀死或打伤了。
    柯尔生将军说，他要竭尽全力防止将来再发生暴行与流血事件。柯尔生将军说，他可以保证：战俘可以预期他们将来要在战俘营里受到符合国际法原则的人道待遇。柯尔生将军说，他可以声明：在把杜德将军安全地放出来以后，不会再有强迫甄别战俘或是重新武装战俘的事情，不会再企图进行徒有虚名的甄别。
    他的招认证明：战俘营美军当局以暴力与屠杀手段进行强迫甄别的罪恶行为，其目的在于镇压朝中战俘的正义抗议和反抗。
    全世界都知道“我们的生命处在险境中，帮助我们快快逃出这座美国地狱”这个惊人的文件——巨济岛人民军官兵发出的信件。这个文件全部都值得我们予以最密切的注意。
    我只是引证这个文件中许多事实中的一个事实。
    “一九五二年五月十九日，在第六十六号战俘营，美国强盗制造了卑鄙到极点的阴谋。他们当时宣布凡是希望到北朝鲜去的战俘必须在当晚七点钟作好乘船准备，在自己的帐篷里待命。当然，没有一个人例外，我们全都希望回到故乡。当我们列队等候出发时，美国兵竟用机关枪、火焰喷射器向我们扫射起来。他们甚至出动了坦克。我们的同志当场死了一百二十七名，并有许多人负伤。”在五月二十日和二十一日两天中，有一千以上朝鲜人民军战士被叫到美军司令部受询问并听取所谓“自愿遣返”的建议，当他们回来时，许多人已经变成了血肉不分的残废，有的断臂，有的胸部受了刀伤，有的背上、胳臂或胸前被烙上了印记。
    “五月二十二日和二十三日，美国警备兵们在第六百零二号和第七十三号战俘营里也制造了类似的血腥暴行。我们的同志被机关枪和手榴弹杀死了八十八人，射伤或炸伤三十九人。
    “五月二十三日，在第七十六号战俘营，美国刽子手为了恫吓‘不逊’的人，曾把四位爱国者的头颅砍下来挂在树上。同一天，美国刽子手又在第十六号帐篷里用电刑使我们的十八个同志变成了瞎子。
    “我们写这封信的时候，五月二十四日就要到来，但是我们清楚地知道新的迫害、拷问、虐待、凌辱正在等待着我们。
    “美国战俘营负责人波纳已经公开扬言，一定要狠狠地索取杜德和柯尔生事件的代价。”
    这封从巨济岛寄出的信是由六千二百二十三名战俘署名的。不只是波纳一个人，威胁着要作进一步的报复。六月间抵达巨济岛的克拉克将军曾说，美军司令部准备对战俘使用必要的最大武力，并说，他不喜欢共产党旗帜在战俘营上飘扬。
    这一切事件并不使得艾奇逊先生觉得不安。艾奇逊企图把这种对于那些抗议所谓“询问”或“甄别”——也就是强行扣留战俘——的战俘加以灭绝人性的屠杀的暴行，说成是自然的、合法的、甚至是人道的。
    这一切事件证明了另外一个不可辩驳的事实——朝中战俘的紧密团结、他们的勇气和英雄气概，这是那种为使朝中爱国者背叛他们的事业和祖国而采取的最残暴的手段所不能破坏的。
    艾奇逊先生要想为加于美国战俘营中手无寸铁的朝中战俘的恣意威吓和暴行进行辩解的一切企图，都在事实面前失败了，事实是掩盖不住的，事实有力地揭发了这些战俘营中所发生的灭绝人性的暴行。美国报上最近的消息报道巨济岛上新的枪杀事件：在十月一日那一天，有五十二名战俘被两排美军击毙，一百十三名战俘被击伤。这两排美国军队是派去镇压朝鲜战争开始以来一次最严重的——“纽约时报”这样报道——战俘叛乱。
    根据美国报纸的报道，这次事变的原因不明，但是显然这是发生在中国战俘庆祝中华人民共和国成立三周年的时候。据美联社的一则消息，在十月二十四日那一天，有九名共产党战俘在釜山第二号战俘营被击伤。根据克拉克将军总部的声明说，这次事件的主要原因是战俘领袖被迁移到另外一个战俘营中去。
    难道这些事实没有雄辩地证明艾奇逊为了辩解所谓“甄别”或“询问”战俘而提出的论据是完全站不住脚的吗？
    美方强迫扣留战俘的暴行
    完全违反国际法和国际惯例
    为了对上述的暴行进行辩解，艾奇逊先生企图在这里证明，美国在遣返战俘问题上的态度是符合国际法和国际惯例的。艾奇逊先生花了许多力气来辩解收容战俘的一方可以强行扣留战俘，藉口是他们不愿意回家。艾奇逊先生企图把第一委员会和舆论的注意力从遣返时不可强行甄别的问题转移到“自愿遣返”的问题上来。
    艾奇逊先生企图证明不愿被遣返的战俘现在成了朝鲜停战谈判中的问题。
    但是那是不正确的。正如艾奇逊所说，问题是美军司令部企图强迫朝中战俘放弃遣返，用强行甄别的办法来使他们这样做。
    艾奇逊先生承认在大多数战俘营里，由于战俘的反抗，美军司令部没有能够进行询问。尽管这样，美国当局还是一直坚持说收容战俘的一方没有义务遣返全体战俘，又说，他们可以“甄别”那些不愿被遣返的战俘，可以使用我们从巨济岛、济州岛、釜山和其他地方的战俘营事件中看到的方式和手段，对战俘任意进行所谓“询问”。
    艾奇逊先生说，这与国际法和国际惯例的原则是完全符合的。这是一个什么问题呢？这就是用不允许强迫战俘回到他们所属的一方的问题来代替另外一个问题——国际法不允许强迫询问和甄别，因为强迫询问或甄别实际上就意味着强制扣留战俘。艾奇逊先生不能，也没有人能够举出丝毫的证据，来证明国际法和国际惯例居然容许这种不让战俘行使他们被遣返的权利和机会的强迫甄别。美军司令部所进行的询问——强迫询问或甄别——事实上就意味着强制扣留战俘。艾奇逊建议对这个问题加以研究，硬说美国方面遵守日内瓦公约的人道原则，硬说美国方面关于遣俘的态度，完全符合上述公约。
    我们准备研究一下这个问题，以便证明美方的立场不但决不符合日内瓦公约，并且悍然违反日内瓦公约和以该公约的原则为基础的国际惯例的要求，它不但违反一九四九年的公约，并且违反一九二九年的公约、一九零七年的海牙公约和美国自己的惯例。只要分析一下美利坚合众国所签订的一些条约，便可以看出这一点。
    那么，让我们研究一下这个问题。
    我们认为：从三个观点——道德观点、政治观点和法律观点来研究这个问题是很重要的。
    一、从道德观点看，这个问题就是需要以允许战俘自由表达意志或者说他们有意志自由为准则的问题。但是，如果忽略能够表达“自由意志”时的情况，忽视可以形成这种情况、可以使他们作出各种不同的决定的一切条件和环境及其影响，便不能决定这个问题。因此，在这里所发生的第一个问题就是战俘的被俘地位和他所处的境地能否提供必要的条件，使战俘可以在不受任何影响的情况下对某一个问题采取决定。只要提出这个问题，便可以很显然地看出来回答是否定的。因为，被俘的地位并不是适于进行自由选择和自由决定的先决条件，特别是不得不在机关枪枪口下面作出这样一个决定的时候。
    谁都知道：战俘很容易受到俘掳他们的国家的当局的非法压迫，而且像朝鲜的美国战俘营那样，常常会受肉体迫害与虐待，因此就根本不可能提出自由意志的问题。
    因此，从道义原则的观点来说，要求战俘们承认他们愿意或不愿意回家这件事是绝对要不得的。艾奇逊先生曾说：通常的想法是：战俘总是希望回家的。既然如此，那么，就不妨问一问：究竟还有什么必要为了所谓审核战俘要求回家的愿望而进行任何询问呢？很明显的，并没有这种必要，也不可能有任何必要。
    二、从政治观点来看，任何种类的询问战俘，或者甄别战俘，或者所谓按照愿意或不愿意被遣返的观点对他们加以分类，都是禁不起一驳的，因为这种行动极容易变成而且实际上也经常带有一种挑衅性质，并将产生严重的政治后果，从而破坏有关各国间的正常关系的基本原则，即：主权平等和互相尊重双方国内政治关系和国外政治关系方面的政治权利的原则。
    不少例子证明，所谓询问和甄别的目的是要利用这种战俘来反对他们自己的政府，损害他们祖国的利益。在一九一四年至一九一八年的世界大战后的最初几年，曾有人企图利用战后遗留在法国、英国、奥匈、与其他某些国家的俄国战俘，来对付苏联。
    在一九二○年，法国政府采取积极措施，招募俄国战俘加入白匪军。法国政府违反无条件遣返全部俄国在法国的战俘的原来诺言，对没有武装的战俘，施行最专横的行动与惨酷的暴行。俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国外交人民委员与乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国外交人民委员一九一九年七月二十九日的照会，提到了法国政府扬言要把这些第一次世界大战后被拘在法国的俄国士兵送给邓尼金，以便对年轻的苏维埃共和国作战的事实。这种行动，当时是在种种藉口下实行的。苏维埃国家的照会正确地指责这些行为是力图“把战俘当作在市集上进行买卖的交换品”。
    法国总理密勒兰在一九二○年八月二十六日以法国政府的名义致苏维埃政府的一封无线电报说：
    “我已获悉你方致南森先生的声明，得知你方同意法国政府尽速完成交换全部在俄国的法国战俘与在法国的俄国战俘的建议。”
    保加利亚沙皇政府也牵涉进了这件事情。一九二零年三月二十九日，保加利亚军队的一名上校纳科夫到了瓦尔纳的集中营，他告诉拘留在那里的俄国战俘说，他们应该到克里米亚去参加反抗苏维埃国家的前将领弗兰格尔的军队。被拘的战俘拒绝了，但是战俘营已被法国和保加利亚的军队以及保加利亚的骑警包围了；机关枪已经对着战俘架设起来，除了一些逃跑的以外，他们大多数，都在枪口的威胁下被押上了一艘轮船，送到克里米亚去了。
    我不得不提到俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国外交人民委员一九一九年十一月二十八日致法国、英国、美国、日本和意大利政府的一件照会，那个时候，所谓盟国间的遣送俄国战俘委员会实际上已经成了一个招募反革命土匪——俄罗斯人民的敌人——的委员会了。当时苏维埃政府强烈地抗议这种非法的行动，要求那些政府对俄国战俘的命运负全部责任，因为上述政府意图迫使这些战俘对他们的兄弟作战。当时苏维埃政府警告上述政府说，它保留采取必要的对策的权利，并提醒它们说，苏维埃政府拘有协约国的军官以及许多德国战俘，这使得苏维埃政府能够更容易地采取俄罗斯人民群众的切身利益所要求的对策。
    那一次，那些喜欢空谈理论的人也提到了战俘的自由意志，提到他们的所谓不愿被遣返，所谓宁愿留在资本主义世界的所谓“自由”国家里。然而，事实上，这些事件的根本原因是想阻挠这些俄国战俘回国，以便利用他们来加强邓尼金、弗兰格尔、高尔察克、尤登尼奇及年轻的苏维埃共和国的其他类似的敌人的军队。
    没有任何疑问，在交换朝中战俘问题上，同样的把戏在重演着；美军司令部在所谓战俘自己不愿被遣返的藉口之下，企图把朝中战俘扣留下来，以便把他们送到台湾和南朝鲜去，从而利用他们来反对他们的祖国。
    三、艾奇逊先生在谈到法律考虑的时候企图证明美国的立场完全符合国际法和国际惯例。
    艾奇逊先生认为必须提醒大家注意苏维埃政府在革命初期所签订的某些条约。他举出一九一八—一九二○年的苏维埃政府所签订的一些协定。艾奇逊先生说，这些协定证明苏维埃政府并未在那些条约里坚持遣返那些想留在俘掳他们的国家里的战俘。然而，艾奇逊先生把他的任务想像得太容易了一些，事实上并不这样容易。
    当他分析以上的条约的时候，他自己完全脱离了当时的情况，脱离了当时的真实的情况。他只是看见条约的条文、法律的公式，但他却完全忘记了产生这些条文的社会关系和当时的情况，忘记了那互相对立的政治观念与潮流的斗争、社会与阶级利益的斗争，而所有这些斗争都在这些条文里，留下了烙印。
    艾奇逊先生所谈到的这些条约不过是那种斗争的结果，自然他们不能不带有、而且也只能带有某些妥协的痕迹。我们一定不要忽视这一点，因为如果我们离开历史事件的全貌来断章取义地看一个文件，取消它的必要的内容，那末便不可能适当地来估计这个文件。为了使大家了解苏联政府在准备和缔结任何条约中艾奇逊先生所提到的有关战俘问题那一部分时所遵循的基本原则，就必须分析一下那个时候和那个时代的事态发展的进程与情况；就必须根据苏维埃国家当时国内外情况的特点以及它与人所共知想要毁灭年轻的苏维埃共和国的那些国家之间的关系，来估计一下这个或那个外交文件的内容和性质，特别是那个时候苏维埃政府所缔结的各项协定的内容和性质。
    人们必须不仅研究这些协定，而且还要研究反映苏俄在这个时期的政治与国际地位的其他文件。这样，人们才不至于就艾奇逊先生在他十月二十四日的发言中所提到的一些协定作出轻率而无根据的结论和判断。
    我们了解，艾奇逊先生之所以提到以上的苏联政府的关于交换战俘的协定，是因为他想用它们来证明苏联政府一贯遵守这样一项原则：以战俘是否愿意遣返来作为遣返的根据。但他对于若干具体情况没有加以考虑。假如我们研究艾奇逊先生提到的俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国和英国于一九二零年在哥本哈根签订的交换战俘的协定，我们就一定会看到苏联政府在该协定的第七条中的确答应遣返全部愿意被遣返的英国战俘。但同时，该协定的第一条规定，英国政府必须遣返英帝国中或在英国政府所管辖的任何地方的全部俄国战俘，而无须由战俘表示是否愿意遣返。这一点也可以从外交人民委员部一九一九年十二月十九日的照会中看出来，该照会就这个问题写道：
    “从一开始我们就向英国建议进行真正的全面交换，即我方释放全部英国人员，而英国则放回他们拘留的全部我方人员，其中包括被英国逮捕的我国驻波斯使团的雇员，同时英国必须扫除我国俘虏和公民从德国和我们将与之单独进行关于交换问题的谈判的中立国家回国的障碍。”在这里，你们可以看到这样一个重要的事实：一个条约中有着两项关于遣返战俘问题的条款。我们俄国人当时要求把全部战俘放回到我方，但是我们准备同意这样的要求：只把希望回国的战俘遣返到英国。艾奇逊没有注意到这两个条款之间的这种细微的区别。他很可能没有看协定原文。他大概只看了秘书草拟的备忘录。但是对我们做部长的人来说，只看秘书草拟的备忘录而不详加核对，是一件很危险的事情。
    必须指出：英国政府建议把从北方运往英格兰的一百名俄国人交给苏联政府，而要苏联政府释放所有英国人员——战俘和平民，苏联政府是反对这个建议的。
    在同年十一月二十九日的照会中，苏联政府坚决主张“全面交换我国和盟国的被俘人员”。寇松勋爵拒绝了这个适用于一切盟国的全面交换的计划，而建议先按照一对一的办法交换军官和士兵，然后按照同样的原则交换平民战俘。
    如果我们仔细地研究一下上述的照会，我们就不会不注意到：苏联政府在这些照会里从来也没有提到只把那些表示愿意遣返的战俘加以交换的话。
    艾奇逊先生提到俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国一九二零年四月二十日和法国成立的协定。但是如果他对于这样的一个问题是较认真地加以研究而不是单靠那些明明是不愿探究这些问题的秘书们拟出的备忘录的话，他就势必要注意到俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国外交人民委员部于一九一九年七月二十九日拍发给当时的法国外交部长皮雄的电文。皮雄说：“他遣返这些俄国人的愿望是确定的，是不受和苏联进行的任何谈判的影响的，法国政府将继续自动地把他们送回家”，换句话说，就是不使这事附带任何条件，总而言之是承认遣返全体俘虏的原则而不作任何种类的甄别。苏联政府对这点完全同意。法国外交部在以后关于这个问题的电文中曾重申这个诺言，完全没有提到任何交换条件。
    然而皮雄政府并没有实践诺言，外交人民委员部很正当地责备法国政府说，从以后的发展、特别是关于由法国遣返的俄国士兵的登陆一事看来，“不能指望目前的法国政府会有最起码的高尚和感激的表示，法国政府的庄严声明和诺言虽然重复了许多次，但是并没有任何价值。”
    问题是在于：虽然皮雄答应“确定而且不受任何谈判的影响”（也就是不受任何条件的限制）遣返俄国战俘，但当一部分俄国战俘运到敖德萨港口的时候，皮雄却提出条件，必须把俄国军队在乌克兰所俘掳的法国战俘以及甚至包括中立国公民在内的一切外国人都交给法国政府，并且扬言假若不履行这个条件，他们就要把俄国士兵交给邓尼金，加紧封锁黑海沿岸，并炮轰敖德萨。
    在这种时候，苏联政府仍然忠实于它的原则并且坚持原则，不将交换战俘的事附上任何条件。同时，苏联政府反对法国当局的讹诈，法国当局利用从法国遣回的饱受痛苦和精疲力竭的俄国士兵作为讹诈的工具。
    以上的例子证明，艾奇逊从苏联政府在十月革命后头几年中签订的交换战俘协定中所引证的个别几点，本身并未说明苏联政府在这个问题上的原则立场。从以上所述可以清楚看出，这些协定是当时的具体条件的产物，当时苏俄正紧张地进行着克服在伟大十月社会主义革命的道路上的困难的艰苦斗争，因此，它在与其他国家的关系上，特别是在这些国家的关于遣返战俘的要求上，作了在当时历史条件下所不得不作的这种决定。
    艾奇逊先生提到布列斯特—立托夫斯克条约。但他一定知道，这个条约是苏联政府被迫签订的，它是一个最富有掠夺性的、最可恶的条约。单是这一点就要求我们谨慎，不要根据这种材料而得出结论。
    国际法中关于这个问题的原则是什么呢？这个原则在若干国际公约中都有明文规定，例如，海牙公约第二十条说：“两国讲和后，所有战俘应尽早遣返回国。”
    又如，一九二九年关于战俘的日内瓦公约的第七十五条说：“无论如何，战俘之遣返应在媾和后最短时间内实行。”
    又如，一九四九年日内瓦公约的第一百一十八条说：“实际战事停止后，战俘应即予释放和遣返，不得迟延。”
    从下面这一节，就可以看出这一条是规定得十分明白的：
    “冲突各方为停战而缔结之协定中，如无关于上述事项之规定，或不能成立此项协定者，各拘留国应即依照前一节所定之原则，自行制定并执行遣返计划，不得迟延。”
    同时，根据第一百一十八条可以断言：有关各方的双边协定中所规定的其他条款绝不得损害上述国际公约的效力。
    同一条规定：如无关于负担运送战俘之费用之协定，则此项协定之缔结“绝不得作为迟延遣返战俘之理由”。作为上述规定的唯一例外的保留条款包括在这个公约的第一百一十九条中，这一条规定可以拘留因刑事上之犯罪被诉讼或因刑事上之犯罪业已定罪的战俘。
    从一九四九年日内瓦公约的第七条也可以看出这个公约的所有各条都是规定得十分明确的。第七条规定：
    “在任何情况下战俘不得放弃本公约或上条所述特别协定——如其订有是项协定——所赋予彼等权利之一部或全部。”
    这一条十分明确，从这里面找不出任何理由来硬说战俘自己不愿意遣返，以此作为藉口来扣留所拘的战俘。在一九四九年的日内瓦国际会议上，在讨论到奥地利代表所提出的承认战俘有权拒绝遣返的建议时曾发生过争论。在那次会议上，苏联代表团坚决反对这个建议。我必须指出，由于美国代表团的功劳，美国代表帕克将军也和苏联代表及那次会议上的大多数一起反对奥地利的建议。
    同时，我不能不提醒劳埃德先生：在一九四九年的日内瓦会议上，英国代表说，通过这样的一个修正案是不明智的，因为拘留战俘的国家有义务把战俘送回他们在被俘时所服务的国家。奥地利的修正案被那次会议上的大多数否决了。
    这是国际法的主要原则，而对于这个原则，艾奇逊却只字未提，虽然他差不多花费了三个钟头来申述他的立场，企图为美国司令部不顾国际法和国际惯例的一切基本原则对朝中战俘施行的棍棒法和无法无天的暴行进行辩解。
    联合国大会关于和平解决战俘问题的措施的决议也可以证明这一点。
    大家知道，这个决议追求着敌视苏联的目的，这一点艾奇逊在他的演说中也已经证实了。可是由于那项决议中对交换战俘的一般问题有明文规定，艾奇逊先生就无法否认这样一个事实：那项决议直接驳倒了他自己在这里力图为之辩护的原则；那项决议要求所有国家遵守公认的国际关系准则和一九四九年的日内瓦公约，要求它们不在自愿的问题上有任何保留，而自愿问题却正是艾奇逊先生在他的演说中最强调的一点。
    艾奇逊先生力图为在朝鲜的美军司令部和美国政府在交换战俘问题上所采取的行动辩解，并断言这种行动如何如何符合国际公法和国际惯例的原则，那末，上面所举的这一切事实和材料难道还不能使艾奇逊先生懂得他这种企图和说法是多么没有根据吗！
    艾奇逊先生提到了上述决议，而要驳斥在朝鲜的美军司令部在交换战俘问题上所采取的绝对不正确的立场，要证明在朝鲜的美国司令部严重地破坏了一九四九年日内瓦公约，这恰恰是最好不过的方法了。
    艾奇逊在结束他的演说的时候说了一句好听的话，他说美国当局主张在诚恳的基础上和平解决朝鲜问题。
    但是，如果他坚持美国强迫扣留战俘的建议，这就意味着：事实上，他打算采取一个不同的立场，这种立场决不能说是一个诚恳的基础。
    结论：国际法和国际惯例的主要原则是必须无条件地、无限制地、完全地交换战俘，就是：俘掳战俘的一方必须保证遣返一切战俘，不许以任何藉口推诿，不得采取任何人为的手段，尤其不许采取凭借拷打和杀害战俘等野蛮暴力，企图强力阻挠这些战俘回国的手段；不许采取用战俘的“自由意志”、“自愿遣返”之类骗人的、伪善的词句来掩饰他们的非法行动的措施。苏联遵守国际法的这个根本原则，维护这个原则并将继续维护它，正像每个人都准备维护他的国家一样。与此截然相反，那些把个人集团的自私利益放在祖国利益之上，放在和平合作的利益之上的人，却破坏了这个原则。警告他们不要采取这种步骤，是我们的职责。否则，联合国就不能完成它的任务，联合国的威信与名声就要受到严重的玷污。
    美国参与缔结的许多协定
    也规定必须全部遣返战俘
    除去以上所述，还需要根据下述事实指出几点。这个事实是：艾奇逊先生一方面不厌其详地谈论苏俄在一九一八年到一九二○年间签订的协定，另一方面却对美国所签订的协定默不作声，虽然这些协定是和交换战俘有直接的关系的。这是可以了解的，因为这些条约，如一八九八年美国和西班牙之间的条约所根据的并不是所谓“自愿遣返”的原则，而是根据国际法中公认的必须全部遣返战俘的原则。艾奇逊先生对于一九一八年凡尔赛和约——美国总统威尔逊的作品——这样一个在这个问题上特别值得注意的条约也保持缄默。这个条约的第二百二十条也谈到了必须全部遣返的原则。
    是不是还有必要提一下美国在第二次世界大战期间所签订的停战协定？这些协定一致要求尽速全部遣返战俘，对于“自由表示意志”却没有提到一个字。是不是值得提一下对意大利和约的第七十一条？这一条明白地说：
    “意大利战俘应该遵照各拘留国与意大利所达成的协议，尽速遣返。”在对罗和约（第二十条）、对保和约（第十九条）、对匈和约（第二十一条）中，也有同样的规定。大家知道，所有这些条约都是美利坚合众国也签过字的。
    如果我们看一看关于打败德国的宣言和关于日本投降的文件，我们就可以知道：这些文件也规定德日当局必须没有任何保留地释放隶属于联合国家的军队的全体战俘，移交给盟国代表。
    关于打败德国的宣言的第六条说：“甲、德国当局必须按照盟国代表所拟订的程序释放目前在他们手里的隶属联合国家军队的全体战俘，移交给盟国代表，并提出这些人的全部名单，说明他们被拘押在德国或德国所占领的领土上的什么地点。”
    日本投降文件第七条说：“我们现在命令日本帝国政府和日本帝国参谋本部立即释放现在在日本控制之下的全体战俘和被拘平民，并对他们加以保护照顾、赡养和立即把他们送到指定地点。”
    艾奇逊先生显然认为承认拒绝遣返之可能性的双边协定就证明国际惯例中有这些协议。但是，在这里，必须记住两种情况：一、如果说有一个协定特地规定拒绝遣返俘虏的权利，那么这一事实就只是证明普遍承认的不许拒绝遣返俘虏的原则是有效力的。    
    英国人所说的“例外是对规则的证明”不是没有道理的。
    二、假如支持朝鲜军事司令部的态度的美国代表团所坚持的原则在国际法中占重要地位的话，那么就没有必要再缔结特别的协定来限制这个原则了。国际法准则就已足够。但是，并没有这样一个准则。倒是有一个准则直接排除了美国政府正试图执行的原则。但是这个政府不愿意遵守公认的准则，因为这对他们是不利的。
    为了了解科学家们的普遍的或一致的意见，向科学家们——国际法权威们——请教是值得的。从著名的英国律师、国际法专家奥本海马教授、美国芬卫克教授、哈佛大学教授威尔逊，著名的法国律师、国际法专家福歇尔、著名的俄国国际法专家马顿斯教授以及许多其它的人的言论里可以看到，他们都持同一看法：媾和以后，必须立刻遣返战俘，这是一九○七年海牙公约所规定的，这是一八九八年美国和西班牙缔结和约时的情况，这也是一九一八年十一月十一日与德国的停战协定第十条所规定的。
    我们可以得出以下的不言自明的结论：公认的国际法原则与准则必须遵守，当这种原则和准则被记载在许多国家签字的国际公约上的时候，就更加如此。这些国家签订了这种国际公约，就必须承担道义上以及法律上的责任。国际法不能像玩弄一根棍棒一样，任意按照这种或那种暂时利益和自私的目的变来变去。不能期望这种目无法纪的态度不受舆论的谴责，不遭受一切正直人民的极强烈的抗议，不激起人们的反对——爱好和平的人民的良心在受到震惊与侮辱的时候，必然要产生这种反对。
    交换战俘问题目前是使朝鲜问题不能和平解决、使已经进行了两年多的朝鲜战争及其所造成的困苦和苦难不能结束的唯一障碍。冷静而客观地研究一下交换战俘的问题，就必然可以看出朝中方面所采取的态度的公正。一切爱好和平的善良人民都必须支持这种态度，因为这种态度为尽早停止朝鲜战争并和平解决朝鲜问题开辟了道路。
    美国所准备的、随后又由一些参加朝鲜战争的国家的代表团共同提出的提案，不能满足这种要求，应该拒绝这个完全不能令人满意的提案。
    “朝鲜统一复兴委员会”的活动
    证明它已变成美国军方的工具
    在与朝鲜局势有关的许多重要问题中间，一个具有重大意义的问题是统一和复兴朝鲜的问题。
    为了促成这个问题的解决而设立的委员会未曾履行它的任务，并已证明完全无力完成这个帮助朝鲜的统一和复兴的重要任务。而且，它甚至不曾为达到这个目标而努力，因为就它的报告、特别是报告中的第七十节看来，它已经变成了美国军方的工具。
    朝鲜统一复兴委员会的整个活动证明，这个委员会的设立完全不是为了帮助朝鲜的统一和复兴，而是为了造成美国侵略者担当了这个任务的印象，以便迷惑舆论。实际上，他们并未担当这个任务，而且，只要他们还在进行侵略朝鲜人民的野蛮战争，还在毁坏整个的城市和乡村，还在蹂躏朝鲜国土，还在屠杀朝鲜居民，他们就不能担当起这个任务。打着联合国招牌的美国侵略者居然会担当起复兴朝鲜的任务并为朝鲜的统一而努力——这种说法的荒谬绝伦是不言自明的。强加于朝鲜人民的战争进一步加深了南北朝鲜的分裂，统一根本谈不到；对北朝鲜后方的野蛮轰炸，消除了复兴工作的一切可能性。
    苏联代表团建议设立委员会
    采取措施和平解决朝鲜问题
    很明显，在朝鲜问题上，目前的主要任务是结束战争，以和平方式解决朝鲜问题。
    波兰代表团提出的建议完全符合于这个要求，因为这些建议合起来就是一个旨在有效地解决最根本、最重要的问题——朝鲜和平与战争问题——的全面的行动纲领。由于第一委员会在确定审议问题的次序时所作的不正确的决定，波兰代表团的建议要到以后才讨论。目前，议程上的项目是联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会的报告。根据这个项目的任务，苏联代表团提出几项建议供第一委员会讨论，苏联代表团并相信，这些建议会得到真心诚意为朝鲜的统一复兴而努力的所有代表团的正当的支持。
    我们的提案如下：“大会研究了朝鲜统一复兴委员会的报告，认为有必要：
    设立一个由直接有关的各方以及其他国家——其中包括没有参加朝鲜战争的国家——参加的和平解决朝鲜问题委员会。
    责成上述委员会立即采取措施，本着由朝鲜人自己在上述委员会的监督下统一朝鲜的精神来解决朝鲜问题。”
