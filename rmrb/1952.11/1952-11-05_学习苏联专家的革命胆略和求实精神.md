Learning from the Revolutionary Courage and Realistic Spirit of Soviet Experts
Yu Guangsheng, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the China Changchun Railway Company

The Chinese employees of the China Changchun Railway have deeply felt the sincere and friendly assistance from the great socialist country of the Soviet Union through their personal experience over the past two years. Soviet experts, with their selfless and tireless spirit, carried out extremely arduous transformation work, making the China Changchun Railway take on a completely new look in a short period of just over two years. We see that before the end of the year, the entire property of the China Changchun Railway, which has been improved and developed during the Sino-Soviet co-management, will be handed over to our government, along with the advanced socialist management methods and systems carefully planned and organized by Soviet experts. Especially in the process of close cooperation between Chinese and Soviet comrades, the excellent work style of Soviet experts has left an indelible and profound impression.

Comrade Yelogov, Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of the China Changchun Railway Company—my respected colleague and teacher, often quoted Comrade Stalin's famous words:

"The Russian revolutionary boldness is a disinfectant that can eliminate stubborn habits, conservative ideas, conservatism, stagnation of thought, and blind obedience to old traditions. The Russian revolutionary boldness is a stimulating force that can awaken thought, promote progress, destroy the old, and open up the future. Without it, progress is impossible."

"The Bolshevik's practical spirit is an irresistible force that knows and recognizes no obstacles, and sweeps away all and any obstacles with its practical and persevering spirit. Once it has started to do something, it must do it to the end, even if the matter is not very big; without this force, serious construction work cannot be accomplished."

For more than two years, Soviet experts, led by Comrade Yelogov, have implemented the work style of combining Russian revolutionary boldness with the Bolshevik's practical spirit into their actual work, and taught Chinese cadres accordingly.

Recalling two years ago, when we first started to compile the comprehensive production and financial plan for the entire railway, Soviet experts emphasized that the production and financial plan approved by the state is a part of the overall national plan. It must conform to the policy instructions of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, as well as the tasks and guidelines given by the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government and the Northeast People's Government. The production and financial plan is the embodiment of the national policy, and it is the law of the country. The production and financial plan is the prerequisite for implementing the economic accounting system, the highest concentrated goal of the entire railway, and the foundation for the patriotic labor emulation of all employees. The plan must embody the policy of making the China Changchun Railway a model railway with high efficiency, low cost, and high profits, and a school for training Chinese railway cadres. The experts particularly pointed out that the volume of transportation must conform to the development of the national economy and become a force to promote economic construction; in terms of indicators, we must pay close attention to transportation costs and labor productivity, which are signs of increasing national accumulation and the progress of the new society.

Starting from such revolutionary courage, Soviet experts adopted a very serious attitude to compile the plan. For example, when Chinese comrades were learning to make the first draft of this year's production and financial plan, they believed that with the increase in transportation volume, changes in material prices, and personnel expenses, the indicators were not tight enough. Soviet experts patiently and seriously criticized them, pointing out that the increase in personnel should be less than the increase in transportation volume, such as the fact that the same number of people were used for two pairs of trains and ten pairs of trains at small intermediate stations; although material prices have changed, consumption quotas can be greatly improved, and so on. This meticulous spirit greatly improved the quality of the second draft. As a result, in this year's plan, the workload increased by 16.1 percent compared with last year, and the operating personnel did not increase; however, the total wage increased by 39.9 percent, and the average monthly wage per person increased by 50.6 percent (wages include auxiliary wages, housing, water and electricity expenses, and increased values). Therefore, labor productivity increased by 55.3 percent compared with last year's plan and 25.2 percent compared with last year's actual; transportation costs, calculated at comparable prices, decreased by 39 percent compared with last year's planned cost and 24.4 percent compared with last year's actual cost. Requiring such significant progress on these two main indicators and adopting specific measures fully demonstrated the revolutionary courage of the Russians and the practical spirit of the Bolsheviks.

Soviet experts have devoted a great deal of effort to reasonably formulating the organizational staffing and wage system of the China Changchun Railway, determining the responsibilities of each employee, one person for one position, consolidating the responsibility system, establishing a fixed production shift system and a joint labor system, and promoting piece-rate wages and line contracting systems.

Soviet experts often quoted Comrade Stalin's famous words: "The production plan is the living practical activity of millions of people, and the reality of our production plan is the millions of laborers who create a new life." Soviet experts often used the documents of Lenin and Stalin and the experience of Soviet socialist construction to illustrate a universal truth: the inseparability of implementing plans, launching labor emulation, and promoting advanced experience. The realization of the plan depends only on the patriotic labor emulation of millions of people. To constantly lead the labor emulation to new heights, it is necessary to promote the advanced experience of the "millions of laborers who create a new life."

From this point of view, the Party, the administration, the trade union, and the Youth League should work in coordination with different work styles under common goals. Soviet experts who are in charge of administrative leadership in the China Changchun Railway always take the initiative to contact, cooperate, and help political workers, trade union workers, and youth workers. They often say: It is unimaginable to complete the task without doing so.

The leading organs of the China Changchun Railway not only called on employees to participate in the competition, but also formulated a technical organization measures plan to ensure the completion of the production and financial plan, proposed specific goals for the competition, analyzed the completion of tasks, and regularly reported to the competitors. In order to overcome difficulties and weaknesses in their work, the various departments of the China Changchun Railway Administration proposed topics for inventions, creations, and rationalization proposals. In order to make employees understand the impact of their work, the Planning Department of the China Changchun Railway Administration printed small booklets explaining the savings caused by over-fulfilling the targets or the losses caused by not fulfilling the targets. For example, loading one less freight car than planned would result in a loss of a certain amount of money; using empty return trips to load cars could save and increase income by a certain amount per car.

Soviet experts told us that advanced things should be given enthusiastic and concrete support. For example, when Yang Maolin came to the China Changchun Railway Company Board of Directors to talk about his creation of the "Matching Number Car Pickup and Delivery Method," Comrade Yelogov cordially shook hands to thank him, giving him encouragement and high praise. On the September 12th Board of Directors meeting, Soviet experts proposed inviting Huang Xidou and other thirteen advanced drivers and weighers from the full-load, over-axle, 500-kilometer movement to participate. When Huang Xidou and others reported that their crews had reached more than 25 million ton-kilometers of total weight transported by each locomotive per month and had traveled more than 15,000 kilometers, the meeting made a resolution to launch a movement throughout the railway to reach 25 million ton-kilometers of total weight per locomotive per month and run 15,000 kilometers per month, and entrusted the Director of the Administration to immediately give the above-mentioned advanced workers material rewards.

Soviet experts often guided us: As leading cadres of socialist enterprises, we should deeply care about the immediate interests of employees. Before the China Changchun Railway Advanced Workers Congress in August, the Health Department of the China Changchun Railway Administration collected information on the health work of the entire railway, held a health meeting, and the Board of Directors made a special decision. Afterwards, Soviet experts often inquired and checked on this work. In early October, the collective contracts were also generally checked. Soviet experts believed that the improvement of employees' lives is an indispensable and important condition for pushing the competition movement to new heights.

In the competition movement, Soviet experts paid great attention to promoting advanced experience and improving the technical and professional level of cadres and employees. Specialized institutions were established and full-time personnel were assigned in the administrative departments. The Administration and Branch Bureaus had Cultural and Educational Departments and Sections, established technical museums, and ran technical schools. Technical research offices were established in stations and sections. Chief engineers, education engineers, etc. were assigned within organizations at all levels. Various methods were used to cultivate Chinese cadres to improve the technical level of employees. For example, an advanced method training class, guided by Soviet experts, with advanced workers as lecturers and technicians as teaching assistants, used charts and explanations, followed by discussions by learners, and then repeated practice, which was very effective. In the first half of this year, 148 advanced method training classes were held, with 7,195 people studying; 1,091 technical lectures were given, with 346,000 listeners; 7,359 rationalization proposals were made, and 2,989 were adopted, saving a lot of wealth.

For more than two years, in the process of gradually implementing the economic accounting system in the China Changchun Railway, Soviet experts, with amazing revolutionary courage and practical spirit, methodically implemented the economic accounting system in this large and complex railway enterprise.

Soviet experts often told us that we must establish the idea of being masters of our own house ideologically and truly care about economic and financial issues. In 1950, the Administration began to implement the economic accounting system, and affiliated enterprises such as locomotive, vehicle, factory, material, coal, and forestry industries also switched to the economic accounting system, while the Branch Bureaus and their subordinate sections carried out preparatory work, such as changing from reimbursement units to independent accounting units and allocating personnel. In the first three quarters of 1951, 63 units, including five Branch Bureaus, fifteen locomotive sections, thirteen vehicle sections, and twelve electrical sections, were converted into economic accounting units. In 1952, the economic accounting system was consolidated and improved on the original basis, such as improving planning work, final account work, and the accuracy and timeliness of original documents such as accounting statistics, and strengthening financial discipline on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" movement.

In addition to formulating scientific production and financial plans and establishing reasonable organizational and staffing systems, the major measures for implementing the economic accounting system are as follows: (1) Organizing training classes to cultivate financial, accounting, planning, statistical, and labor wage personnel. (2) Reforming accounting work to achieve timely, correct, clear, and easily understood accounting accounting, in order to master and supervise the dynamics of asset management and the implementation of production and financial plans. This means a series of meticulous work, from the original documents filled out at the production site to the balance sheet showing the overall business situation of the enterprise, as well as accounting subjects and expense subjects, all need an innovation. (3) Reforming the wage system, implementing the principle of remuneration according to labor, and promoting the piece-rate system as much as possible to reduce the time-based system, in order to stimulate employees' interest in improving their technical level and improving labor productivity. (4) Ascertaining the working capital of the entire railway, stipulating the working capital standards for each economic accounting unit, and accelerating the turnover of working capital. In addition, the registration of fixed assets was completed in the third quarter of 1952. (5) Organizing economic studies for senior cadres to enable them to obtain the necessary knowledge to master production economics.

Under the guidance of Soviet experts, the China Changchun Railway has a complete process from the formulation, implementation, to summary of the plan. The inspection of work is regular, systematic, pragmatic, and thoroughly implemented. They are good at educating cadres through inspection examples. For example, in the struggle to compress working capital and reduce material reserves, when Comrade Grunichev, Director of the China Changchun Railway Administration, received a request for materials that were too large from a factory on the railway, he first organized a force to check the factory's warehouse, where it was found that the inventory of certain materials requested by the factory would not be used up in several years. Director Grunichev then convened an administrative meeting for discussion and found that the comrade in charge of the factory had not read the material request form. Based on these specific facts, Director Grunichev severely criticized the issue at a high level of principle. The factory director also sincerely conducted a self-criticism. Such a meeting gave all the comrades from various departments present an extremely profound impression.

The China Changchun Railway has a scientific and strict final account audit system. Director Grunichev personally went to the Branch Bureau to preside over the meeting and conduct a centralized audit. In the focused discussion of "Why the overspending?", section chiefs, branch bureau chiefs, and branch bureau chiefs successively spoke, explained the situation, and made self-criticism. Director Grunichev sometimes interjected: "Why should there be no overspending?" Most of the reporters were able to answer: "The production and financial plan is a national law, and no one should violate it." But then Director Grunichev cited a series of facts that violated financial discipline: "Two sets of sofas were bought, a typewriter was bought... none of which were in the plan!" He then said: "Your words are very correct, why not fulfill them in action? If everyone is like this, how can national financial discipline be maintained? How can national capital accumulation be realized?" Such a meeting gave the cadres present a concrete and vivid education and told everyone to effectively use the method of criticism and self-criticism.

Here, I will give another example. Last July, the transportation tasks of the Qiqihar Railway Administration increased sharply, especially with large quantities of coal and timber accumulated in remote mining areas and forest farms. In order to solve the difficulties in transportation, we asked Comrade Yelogov for practical help, and he gladly agreed. In Qiqihar, Comrade Yelogov spent two days and nights studying the characteristics of each trunk and branch line in detail. Some leading cadres of the Qiqihar Railway Administration believed that the capacity of the Suihua to Jiamusi line was limited, and proposed using detour transportation to reduce the burden on the Suijia line. Comrade Yelogov keenly proposed: "If the number of trains cannot be increased, can the train traction be improved?" At that time, the leading cadres of the Qiqihar Railway Administration said that the Suijia line index standard could be increased by a maximum of 18 percent. Comrade Yelogov proposed that we can strive for an increase of 45 percent. We and the Director of the Qiqihar Railway Administration went to Suihua, and the Branch Bureau Chief also felt that it was not certain to increase by 45 percent. Later, from the conversation with the advanced dispatcher Comrade Zhu Diansheng, we learned that individual advanced drivers on the Suijia line had reached more than 63 percent above the traction standard. We also solicited the opinions of the drivers at the Suihua Locomotive Depot meeting. Due to the increased awareness of the workers and the study of advanced Soviet technology, they unanimously believed that increasing the traction fixed number by 45 percent could be achieved with effort. They asked the leadership to solve a series of problems, such as the poor line conditions between Shenshu and Shichang; the unclear signals at Xiaobai Station; and the lack of heating, telephones, and poor meals at the Shenshu shift change location. In fact, the problems raised by the drivers were not difficult to solve as long as the leadership paid attention. Vivid facts effectively persuaded the leading cadres of the Qiqihar Railway Administration. They solved the problems raised by the masses within a time limit, and set off a heat wave to strive for an increase of 45 percent in the fixed traction number, and finally achieved this goal, which played a decisive role in completing the transportation task. Experience has proven that the combination of advanced Soviet experience and the high enthusiasm of our country's workers will inevitably lead to great achievements in work. For more than a year, the overweight traction movement on the Suijia line has further developed, and has now reached 68 percent above the traction standard. It should be pointed out that more than a year ago, the goal of Comrade Yelogov to increase the traction of the Suijia line by 45 percent clearly demonstrated the Russian revolutionary courage and the Bolshevik pragmatic spirit. This goal was an appropriate goal between the level of advanced drivers and the level already achieved by ordinary drivers. In order to carry out this work to the end, Comrade Yelogov also dispatched female engineer Prosgulina, carrying a traction test vehicle, to accompany Chinese advanced drivers from Sujiatun to the Qiqihar Railway Administration to help the drivers of the Suijia line master advanced manipulation methods, and used scientific experiments to strengthen their confidence.

For more than two years, the excellent work style of Soviet experts has given us great inspiration and education, making us deeply realize that while learning the Soviet socialist enterprise management methods, we must also learn the work style of combining revolutionary courage and pragmatic spirit shown by the Russians in national economic management.

All our Chinese comrades of the China Changchun Railway must seize every minute and second to learn from Soviet experts in the process of over-fulfilling the 1952 production and financial plan. (Attached picture)

    学习苏联专家的革命胆略和求实精神
    中国长春铁路公司理事会主席  余光生
    中国长春铁路的中国职工，在两年多来的切身经验中，深切地感受了伟大社会主义国家苏联的真挚友谊的帮助。苏联专家以忘我不倦的精神，进行了极其艰巨的改造工作，使中长铁路在短短两年多的时间中，面貌焕然一新。我们看到，在年底以前将移交给我国政府的，是在中苏共管过程中得到改善和发展的中长铁路全部财产，同时还有苏联专家所精心策划和辛勤组织起来的社会主义的先进的管理方法和管理制度。特别是在中苏同志密切合作的过程中，苏联专家的优良作风，留下了不可磨灭的深刻印象。
    中国长春铁路公司理事会副主席叶洛果夫同志—我的敬爱的同事和老师，常常引述斯大林同志的名言：
    “俄国人的革命胆略是能消除顽固习气，守旧思想，保守主义，思想停滞和盲从老旧传统态度的一种消毒剂。俄国人的革命胆略，是一种兴奋的力量，它能唤起思想，推动前进，破坏旧物，开展前途。没有它，便不可能前进。”
    布尔什维克的“求实精神是一种不可遏止的力量，它不知道而且也不承认有什么阻碍，而以其切实坚忍精神扫除一切和任何障碍，它对于一件事情只要已经开始来做，就一定要做到底，那怕事情并不怎样大；如果没有这个力量，那末认真的建设工作，是无法作成的。”
    两年多以来，以叶洛果夫同志为首的苏联专家们，把俄国人的革命胆略和布尔什维克的求实精神相结合的作风贯彻到实际工作中去，并以此教导中国干部。
    回忆二年以前，在刚开始编制全路的综合性的生产财务计划的时候，苏联专家们便强调指出：经过国家批准的生产财务计划，是整个国家计划的一部分。它必须符合于毛主席和中央人民政府的政策指示，以及中央人民政府铁道部和东北人民政府所给予的任务和方针。生产财务计划是国家政策的体现，就是国家的法律。生产财务计划是推行经济核算制的前提，是全路集中的最高的奋斗目标和全体职工爱国主义劳动竞赛的基础。在生产财务计划中，必须体现使中长铁路成为效率高、成本低、利润多的模范铁路和成为培养中国铁路干部的学校的方针。专家们特别指出：运输量必须符合于国家经济的发展，成为推动经济建设的力量；在指标上，必须特别抓紧运输成本和劳动生产率，这是增加国家积累，表示新社会前进的标志。
    从这样具有革命的胆略出发，苏联专家采取十分严肃的态度来编制计划。比如中国同志学习做今年的生产财务计划第一次草案时，认为运量增多，材料价钱有变动，人员开支必然应当增加，指标定的不够紧。苏联专家耐心而严肃地给以批判，指出了人员的增加应小于运量的增加，如中间小站每天二对车到十对车用人一样多；材料价钱虽有变动，消耗定额大可改进等等。这种丝毫不苟的精神，使第二次草案的质量大大提高。结果今年计划中，工作量比去年实际增多百分之十六点一，运营人员并未增加；而工资总额增加百分之三十九点九，每人每月平均工资增加百分之五十点六（工资包括辅助工资、房水电费及分值增加）。因而劳动生产率，比去年计划增加百分之五十五点三，比去年实际增加百分之二十五点二；运输成本，按比价计算，比去年计划成本降低百分之三十九，比去年实际成本降低百分之二十四点四。对这两个主要指标要求这样巨大的进展，并采取了具体的办法，充分表现了俄国人的革命的胆略和布尔什维克的求实精神。
    苏联专家曾经用了很大的力量，合理地制定了中长铁路的机构定员和工资制度，确定了每个职工的职责，一名一职，巩固了负责制，建立了生产固定班次制和联合劳动制，并推行了计件工资和线路包工制。
    苏联专家们经常引用斯大林同志的名言：“生产计划是千百万人的活的实际活动，我们的生产计划的实在性，就是创造新生活的千百万劳动者。”苏联专家们常常根据列宁、斯大林的文献和苏联社会主义建设的经验，来说明这样一个普遍真理：执行计划、发动劳动竞赛和推广先进经验的不可分离性。计划的实现，只有依靠千百万群众的爱国主义的劳动竞赛。而要把劳动竞赛不断地引向新的高涨，又必须推广“创造新生活的千百万劳动者”的先进经验。
    从这个观点出发，党、行政、工会、青年团就应该在共同目标之下，用不同的工作方式，协调地进行工作。在中长铁路担任行政领导工作的苏联专家们，他们对于政治工作者、工会工作者和青年工作者，总是主动地联系协作和帮助。他们常说：不这样做，完成任务是不可想像的。
    中国长春铁路的领导机关不仅号召职工参加竞赛，而且制定了保证完成生产财务计划的技术组织措施计划，提出了竞赛的具体目标，分析任务完成的情况，经常向竞赛者作报告。为了克服工作中的困难和弱点，中长铁路管理局各处拟出发明创造和合理化建议的课题。为了使员工了解自己工作好坏的影响，中长铁路管理局计划处制印小册子，说明由于超额完成指标所引起的节约或未完成指标所引起的损失。例如比计划少装一辆货车即损失若干元；利用回空方向装车，一辆车可节约及增加收入若干元。
    苏联专家告诉我们对于先进事物，要给予热情和具体的支持。如杨茂林来中国长春铁路公司理事会讲述他创造“对号取送车法”的时候，叶洛果夫同志亲切地握手致谢，给以鼓励和高度的评价。又如九月十二日理事会会议，苏联专家提议请了黄玺斗等十三名满载、超轴、五百公里运动中的先进的司机和司磅员参加。当黄玺斗等报告了他们的乘务组每月都达到了每一机车运输全重二千五百多万吨公里和走行了一万五千多公里以后，会议作出了在全路开展每月每台机车达到二千五百万全重吨公里、每月运行一万五千公里的运动的决议，并委托管理局长立即给予上述先进工作者以物质奖励。
    苏联专家经常指导我们：作为社会主义企业的领导干部，应该深切地关心员工的切身利益。在八月间中长铁路先进工作者大会的前夕，中长铁路管理局卫生处搜集了全路卫生工作情况，举行了卫生会议，理事会又专门作出了决定。以后，苏联专家还经常询问和检查这一工作。十月上旬又普遍地检查了集体合同的情况。苏联专家认为员工生活的改进，是把竞赛运动推向新的高涨的不可少的重要条件。
    在竞赛运动中，苏联专家非常注意推广先进经验和提高干部员工的技术业务水平。在行政方面建立了专门机构和配置了专职人员。在管理局和分局有文教处、科，建立了技术馆，开办了技术学校，在站、段成立了技术研究室。各级组织内配置了总工程师、教育工程师等。并用各种各样的方法，培养中国干部提高员工技术水平。如有一种先进方法训练班，是苏联专家指导，先进工作者作讲师，技术人员助教，进行图表解说，经学习者讨论，再反复实做，收效很大。本年上半年举行了先进方法训练班一四八次，学习的人有七、一九五人；技术讲演一一、○九一次，听讲者有三四六、○○○人；合理化建议有七、三五九件，采纳了二、九八九件，节省了大量财富。
    两年多来，在使中长铁路逐步地贯彻经济核算制的过程中，苏联专家们以惊人的革命胆略和求实精神，在这个庞大复杂的铁路企业中有步骤地贯彻经济核算制。
    苏联专家们经常告诉我们要从思想上树立主人翁的管家思想，并真正关心经济财务问题。在一九五○年，管理局一开始就实行经济核算制，机车、车辆、工厂、材料、煤业、林业等附属企业亦转入经济核算制，而分局及其所属段则进行准备工作，如由报销单位改为独立会计单位和配备人员等。一九五一年头三个季度把五个分局、十五个机务本段、十三个车辆段、十二个电务段等六十三个单位都改为经济核算单位。一九五二年在原有基础上巩固并提高经济核算制，如改进计划工作、决算工作，会计统计等原始单据的准确性和及时性，并在“三反”运动的胜利基础上加强财务纪律等。
    贯彻经济核算制的措施，除了制订科学的生产财务计划、建立合理的机构和定员制度以外，举其大者，有下列几端：（一）组织训练班，培养财务、会计、计划、统计和劳动工资人员。（二）改革会计工作，实现及时的正确的明晰的和易为群众所了解的会计核算，以便掌握和监督资产经营的动态和生产财务计划执行的情况。这意味着一连串的细致工作，如从生产地点所填写的原始单据，到表现整个企业经营状况的资产负债对照表以及会计科目和费用科目等，均需要一番革新。（三）改革工资制度，贯彻按劳取酬的原则，尽可能地推广计件制，减少计时制，以刺激职工对提高自己技术水平的兴趣和提高劳动生产率。（四）查定全路流动资金，规定各经济核算单位的流动资金标准，加速流动资金的周转。此外，固定资产的登记于一九五二年第三季度完成。（五）组织高级干部经济学习，使其得到掌握生产经济的必要知识。
    在苏联专家指导下，中长铁路从计划的制定、执行到总结是一个完整过程。对工作的检查是经常的、有系统的、实事求是的和贯彻到底的。他们善于通过检查的事例来教育干部。比如在压缩流动资金、减低材料储备的斗争过程中，当中长铁路管理局局长格鲁尼切夫同志接到铁路上一个工厂过于庞大的材料请求单时，他先组织了力量查看该厂仓库，在那里发现该厂所请的某些材料存量几年也用不完。格鲁尼切夫局长然后召集局务会议，进行讨论，又发现了该厂负责同志对于材料请求书并未看过，根据这些具体事实，格鲁尼切夫局长就严峻地提到高度的原则水平进行了批评。厂长也恳切地进行了自我检讨。这样的会议，给了所有与会的各部门的同志一个极其深刻的印象。
    中国长春铁路有科学而严格的决算审核制度。格鲁尼切夫局长亲自到分局主持会议，有中心地进行审核。在集中讨论“为什么超支？”时，各段长、分局主管科长、分局长相继发言，说明情况，并做自我批评。格鲁尼切夫局长有时插问：“为什么不应超支？”报告者大都能够答复：“生产财务计划是国家法令，谁也不应违反。”但是接着格鲁尼切夫局长举出一连串的违反财务纪律的事实：“买了两套沙发，买了打字机……都是计划中没有的！”接着说：“你的话说得很对，为什么行动上不兑现？如果大家都这样，国家财政纪律怎样能维持？国家资金积累又怎样能实现？”这样的会议，给了与会干部以具体生动的教育，并告诉大家切实地运用批评和自我批评的方法。
    在这里，我再举一个例子。去年七月齐齐哈尔铁路管理局运输任务激增，特别是在辽远的矿区和林场堆积着大批煤炭和木材。为了解决运输中的困难，我们请求叶洛果夫同志实地帮助，他欣然允许了。在齐齐哈尔，叶洛果夫同志以两昼夜时间详细地研究每一干线和支线的特点。齐齐哈尔铁路管理局有些领导干部认为绥化到佳木斯一线容量有限，曾提议用迂回运输来减轻绥佳线的负担，叶洛果夫同志敏锐地提出：“列车对数不能增加，列车牵引是否可以提高？”当时齐齐哈尔铁路管理局的领导干部说：绥佳线索引标准，最多可以提高百分之十八。叶洛果夫同志提出可以为提高百分之四十五而奋斗。我们和齐齐哈尔铁路管理局局长到了绥化，分局长亦感觉提高百分之四十五没有把握。后来我们从先进的调度员朱殿生同志的谈话中，才知道在绥佳线上个别的先进司机曾经达到超过牵引标准百分之六十三。我们又在绥化机务段的会议上征求了司机的意见，由于工人群众的觉悟提高，又学习了苏联的先进技术，他们一致认为提高牵引定数百分之四十五，经过努力，是可以达到的。他们要求领导方面解决一系列的问题，如神树、石长间线路不好；小白站信号不明；神树换班地点无暖气，无电话，吃饭不好等。其实司机们所提出的问题，只要领导方面注意，是不难解决的。生动的事实，有效地说服了齐齐哈尔铁路管理局的领导干部们，他们限期解决了群众所提出的问题，掀起了为提高牵引定数百分之四十五而奋斗的热潮，终于实现了这个目标，对于完成运输任务起了决定的作用。经验证明：苏联先进经验与我国工人群众的高度积极性相结合，在工作中必然出现巨大的成绩。一年多以来，绥佳线的超重牵引运动更进一步地发展了，现在已经达到超过牵引标准百分之六十八。应当指出：在一年多以前，叶洛果夫同志提出绥佳线牵引提高百分之四十五的目标，明显地表现了俄国人的革命胆略和布尔什维克的求实精神。这个目标是一个介乎先进司机水平和一般司机已达到的水平之间的适当的目标。为了把这个工作贯彻到底，叶洛果夫同志还派遣了女工程师普罗司古利拿同志携带牵引试验车，偕同苏家屯中国先进司机到齐齐哈尔铁路管理局帮助绥佳线司机们掌握先进的操纵方法，并以科学的试验，坚定了他们的信心。
    二年多以来，苏联专家这种优良作风，给予我们很大启示和教育，使我们深深体会到在学习苏联的社会主义企业管理方法的同时，必须学习俄国人在国家经济管理上所表现出来的革命胆略与求实精神相结合的工作作风。
    我们中长铁路全体中国同志，必须在为超额完成一九五二年生产财务计划的过程中，抓紧一分一秒的时间，认真向苏联专家学习。（附图片）
