    "Bright Summer" is a film with a style that is bright and light, like a lyrical song. The first few shots of the film powerfully draw us into real life: the bright summer of Ukraine, with its natural colors making the fertile prairie look extraordinarily beautiful. After demobilizing from the Soviet army, Petro completed his accounting course and returned to his hometown, the "Progress" collective farm. His hometown was both familiar and unfamiliar to this son returning from an expedition, because labor had changed the face of the land, and his hometown was more prosperous and beautiful. He walked along the familiar road, unable to suppress the excitement and joy in his emotions. The wind carried a song from afar. It was Vera, a female member of the "Progress" farm. She was riding in a cart heading towards the village. When the cart crossed a bridge, she accidentally fell into the river. Petro jumped into the water to save her. That’s how they met. It turned out they were old friends from childhood. The plot of the film unfolds in such a bright tone.

    The male and female members of the Ukrainian collective farm who appear in this film are all so fond of labor, full of vigor, optimistic, and bold. In the fields, at festivals, and during rest periods, laughter and songs fly everywhere. The film depicts such a beautiful collective farm and several typical characters: Socialist Labor Hero Oksana, Accounting Director Petro, Communist Youth League member Vera, etc. These advanced figures with communist ideas all possess noble qualities. They love their farm and hope that it will advance and change with each passing day. Among them, Oksana is the most respected figure. She is enthusiastic and calm. In production and in life, she is a role model for the entire farm. Her highest record in labor and her excellent qualities influence and encourage the youth of the entire farm.

    Vera, an outstanding member of the Communist Youth League, is a beautiful, strong, and vibrant young woman. She loves labor, unwilling to lag behind. Her characteristic was revealed when Petro reunited with her on that wooden bridge. He asked her, "Is Oksana the only hero here?" Her answer was, "For the time being." The new production competition conditions after Oksana returned from Moscow excited her. In order to learn from the labor hero, she reorganized her field farming team and challenged the labor hero, raising the production competition conditions even higher. For the benefit of the entire farm, she requested to be transferred to work at the pasture. There, with diligent work and the scientific method of raising dairy cows, she created the highest milk production record, improved the management of the pasture, and expanded the mechanical equipment of the pasture. She tempered herself in her work to become an excellent pasture manager.

    The film expresses the prosperity of today's Soviet collective farms and the happy lives of the people with a beautiful, light comedic style. But the Soviet people are never satisfied with their achievements. They have lofty ideals, and they are marching towards communism with full confidence. On the road to communist society, there are contradictions and struggles. The film reveals this conflict through the two extremely different personalities of Petro and Nazar. Petro works as the accounting director of the farm. This excellent and forward-looking young man, after returning to his hometown and immersing himself in life, discovered the problems existing in the farm: Nazar, the chairman of the "Progress" farm, has serious conservative thinking and bureaucratic style in management. This shortcoming has already caused the farm to stagnate. Nazar is a diligent person with talent, who once led the farm to prosperity. He passionately cherishes the interests of his own farm. However, he lacks lofty ideals and is easily satisfied with existing achievements. The farm's five-year plan is very conservative and has a strong localist ideology; he is unwilling to jointly build a large power station with neighboring farms, fearing that others will take advantage of them. He only focuses on some small daily matters, failing to see the prospects for the farm's development and the growth of the new forces around him. He entrusted the important position of pasture director to Jessliuk, who does not know how to manage the pasture using scientific methods and is unwilling to learn. Vera studied animal husbandry management at school, but he asked her to grow wheat. When the farm members enthusiastically put forward suggestions for developing the farm, he often replied: "Let's build it next year." "Next year" is his working style. He has fallen behind life and become an obstacle to the advancement of life.

    Petro, this passionate, talented, and visionary person, after discovering the shortcomings of the farm, studied everything about the farm in detail, seeing clearly what some people could not yet see. He believes: "Our farm can not only rank first in grain, but also in other aspects... We have too few ideals and too little ambition." In order to propose to the farm's Party committee a constructive, comprehensive, and specific opinion on improving the construction of the farm, Petro set about formulating a plan. The film handles this scene very movingly. He concentratedly cranked the calculator. Numbers were like music to him. About the dairy farm, about the pig farm, about electrification, about mechanization... He precisely calculated the possible production numbers, and these numbers are all achievable with the farm's potential strength. Nazar turned a blind eye to these potential strengths. He even got angry when others brought them up; the numbers in Petro's hands generated the future vision of the collective farm—that is, the continuous increase in the collective farm's wealth and the more beautiful economic and cultural life of the collective farmers.

    It is easy to calculate these numbers in Petro's calculator, but it takes a lot of struggle to turn them into reality. The conflict between Petro and Nazar continued to develop. Complacency, conservatism, and narrow private prejudices caused Nazar to reject the help of his old friend when he needed to agree. Supported by Oksana, Vera and others, Petro insisted on his correct opinions and fought against Nazar. This struggle finally achieved victory under the leadership of the Party. District Party Secretary Luban personally understood the actual situation of the farm and supported Petro's plan. The new five-year plan was unanimously approved at the farm's Party committee meeting. According to this new five-year plan, the total income of the "Progress" collective farm will increase by two hundred and seventy-three percent. The Party committee also approved the plan for the "Progress" farm and several neighboring collective farms to establish a joint power station; approved Vera and a dozen Communist Youth League members to be transferred to work at the pasture. After the Party committee meeting, the farm entered a stage of rapid development. Under the education of the Party, the help of comrades, and the impetus of the continuous advancement of life, Nazar gradually corrected his mistakes. This transformation was natural and finally clearly manifested in his handling of cadre issues. He promoted Vera to pasture director and demoted Jessliuk, the incompetent director who managed the pasture using primitive methods, to deputy director. Nazar's transformation was welcomed by the members of the collective farm.

    In the film, we see the remnants of bourgeois ideology hindering Nazar's progress. This remnant of bourgeois ideology is also very clearly manifested in his love for Oksana. Nazar had long loved Oksana. After Petro returned, he was jealous of Oksana's attitude towards Petro. Nazar's love process was distressed. He went to Luban to ask about this issue: "Is jealousy a remnant of the bourgeoisie? If a person falls in love with someone, shouldn't he not be suspicious of her?" Luban answered very well: "Since you love her, you should trust her." When Nazar realized his mistakes, he was liberated from suspicion and distress. The scene where he mustered up the courage to ask Petro for forgiveness was very touching. Oksana also deeply loves Nazar, but she cannot compromise with Nazar's mistakes. When Nazar was unwilling to accept the correct opinions for improving the farm's work, she left him. When Nazar began to correct his mistakes, she was also the first to express reconciliation to him. This fully shows that she is a new person and the integrity of her new morality.

    "Bright Summer" is a good film. Through the depiction of the rural life of the Soviet Union today, it convincingly makes people feel that the Soviet people have already approached communism in their lives, and the Soviet people are moving towards communism with great strides!

    介绍苏联彩色影片“明朗的夏天”
    苏宜柯
    编剧：包泯什阔夫·达略基  总导演：巴尔奈特  导演：艾斯特林  翻译：尹广文基也辅电影制片厂一九五○年出品  中央电影局东北电影制片厂译制
    “明朗的夏天”，这部影片的风格是明朗的，轻松的，像一支抒情的歌曲。影片的最初几个镜头，就有力地把我们吸引到真实生活里：乌克兰明朗的夏天，天然彩色使得这丰饶的草原显得分外美丽。彼得罗从苏联军队复员后，学完了会计课程，回到故乡“前进”集体农庄来了。故乡对于这个远征回来的儿子熟悉而又陌生，因为劳动改变了土地的面貌，故乡更富裕、更美好了。他踏着熟悉的道路，抑止不住感情上的兴奋和喜悦。风从远处送来了歌声，这是“前进”农庄的女庄员薇拉，她坐在牛车上往庄里走，牛车过桥时，一不小心，她从车上跌到河里，彼得罗跳水救她。这样他们就会面了，原来两个是童年时代的老朋友。影片的情节就是在这样明快的调子里展开的。
    出现在这部影片里的乌克兰集体农庄的男女庄员们，都是那么热爱劳动，生气勃勃，乐观、豪放。在田野上、在节日里、在休息的时候，到处都飞扬着笑声和歌声。影片描绘了这样一个美好的集体农庄和几个典型人物：社会主义劳动英雄欧克莎娜、会计主任彼得罗、共青团员薇拉等。这些具有共产主义思想的先进人物，都有着高贵的品质。他们热爱自己的农庄，希望它日新月异地前进。他们当中，欧克莎娜是最受人敬爱的人物。她热情而沉静，在生产上、生活上，她都是整个农庄的表率。她在劳动上的最高纪录和她的优良品质，影响着和鼓舞着整个农庄的青年们。
    优秀的共青团员薇拉是个美丽、坚强、充满青春活力的青年。她热爱劳动，不甘后人，还是在那座木桥上，彼得罗和她重逢的时候，就显示出了她的这种特点。他问她：“怎么你们这儿就欧克莎娜一个英雄吗？”她的回答是：“暂时一个。”欧克莎娜从莫斯科回来后的新的生产竞赛条件，激动了她。为了向劳动英雄看齐，她整顿了自己的田间农作小队，并且向劳动英雄挑战，把生产竞赛条件提得更高。为着整个农庄的利益着想，她请求调到牧场去工作。在那里，她以勤恳的工作，和用科学的方法饲养奶牛，创造了最高的出奶纪录，改善了牧场的管理，扩大了牧场的机械设备，她在工作中锻炼成为一个优秀的牧场管理者。
    影片以优美的、轻松的喜剧风格，表现了今日苏联集体农庄的富裕和人们的欢乐生活。但苏维埃人永不满足自己的成就，他们有着远大的理想，他们正满怀信心地向共产主义迈进。在走向共产主义社会道路上，是有着矛盾和斗争的。影片在彼得罗和那扎尔这两个极不相同的性格上揭示了这种冲突。彼得罗在农庄担任会计主任的工作。这个优秀的、目光远大的青年，回到家乡，深入生活以后，发觉了农庄中存在着的问题：“前进”农庄主席那扎尔在管理上，有严重的保守思想和官僚主义作风，这种缺点已经使得农庄停滞不前。那扎尔是个勤勉的人，有才干，曾经领导农场走上繁荣的道路，他热情地珍爱着自己农庄的利益。但是他缺乏远大的理想，容易满足于既有的成绩。农庄的五年计划订得很保守，并且有浓厚的本位主义思想；他不愿意和邻近农庄联合建设大发电站，怕别人沾他们的光。他只把注意力放在日常的一些小事情上，看不到农庄发展的远景，以及周围新生力量的成长。他把牧场主任这样一个重要职务，交给一个不懂得用科学方法管理牧场，而又不肯学习的杰斯留克担任。薇拉在学校里是学畜牧管理的，他却叫她去种麦子。农庄庄员们热情地向他提出发展农庄的建议，他常回答：“等明年再建设”。“等明年”就是他的工作特点。他已经落在生活后面，成为生活前进的阻力了。
    彼得罗，这个热情的、有才能的、有远大理想的人，他发现了农庄的缺点后，便详细地研究农庄的一切情况，看清了为一些人暂时还看不清的事情。他认为：“咱们农庄，不但粮食可以占第一位，别的方面也该这样……咱们理想太少，进取心太小。”为了向农庄的党委会提出一个关于改进农庄的建设性的、全面、具体的意见，彼得罗着手拟定计划。影片把这个场面处理得十分动人。他聚精会神地摇着计算器，数字对于他犹如音乐。关于牛奶场，关于养猪场，关于电气化，关于机械化……他精确地计算着可能达到的生产数字，这些数字都是农庄潜在力量所能够完成的。那扎尔对于这些潜在力量熟视无睹，别人提出来，他还发火；彼得罗手中的数字产生了集体农庄未来的远景——这就是集体农庄财富的不断增进，集体农民的经济生活、文化生活更加美好的图样。
    彼得罗的这些数字在计算器上算算是很容易的，要变为现实就需要作很大的斗争。彼得罗和那扎尔的冲突不断发展着。自满、保守和狭隘的私人偏见，使得那扎尔在必需同意的时候，拒绝了老朋友的帮助。彼得罗在欧克莎娜、薇拉等人的支持下，坚持着正确的意见，与那扎尔进行了斗争。这一斗争终于在党的领导下获得了胜利。区委书记鲁班亲自了解了农庄的实际情况，支持了彼得罗的计划，新的五年计划在农庄的党委会上全体一致通过了。根据这个新五年计划，“前进”集体农庄的总收入将增加百分之二百七十三。党委会还批准了“前进”农庄和邻近几个集体农庄建立联合发电站的计划；批准了薇拉和十几个共青团员调到牧场去工作。党委会议以后，农庄走向了飞跃发展的阶段。那扎尔在党的教育、同志们的帮助，在生活不断前进的推动下，也逐渐改正了错误。这种转变是自然的，最后明显地表现在他对于干部问题的处理上，他将薇拉提升为牧场主任，把那个不称职的、用原始方法管理牧场的主任杰斯留克降职为副主任。那扎尔的转变受到集体农庄庄员们的欢迎。
    在影片中，我们看到妨碍着那扎尔进步的资产阶级思想残余，这种资产阶级思想残余表现在他对欧克莎娜的爱情上也十分鲜明。那扎尔老早就爱着欧克莎娜，彼得罗回来后，他嫉妒欧克莎娜对彼得罗的态度。那扎尔的爱情过程是苦恼的。他为这个问题去问鲁班：“嫉妒心是资产阶级残余吗？若是一个人爱上了一个人，他就不应该对他猜疑吗？”鲁班回答地很好：“既然爱她，就应该相信她。”当那扎尔认识了自己的错误后，才从猜忌和苦恼中解脱出来。他鼓起勇气去请求彼得罗原谅的场面，是十分感动人的。欧克莎娜也深深地爱着那扎尔，但是她不能对那扎尔的错误妥协。当那扎尔不愿接受正确的改进农庄工作的意见时，她就离开他。当那扎尔开始改正错误时，也是她首先向他表示和好。这充分表现了她是个新的人，她的新道德的完整性。
    “明朗的夏天”是一部好影片，他通过今日苏联农村生活的描绘，令人信服地感到：苏联人民已经在生活里接近了共产主义，苏联人民正以大的步伐向共产主义迈进！（附图片）
