    "The cooperative's property is also part of mine"
    Editor: On September 14th, Comrade Zhang Yinbao, a cadre from the Lian Tu Lian Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Luan County, was escorting a cart of seed cotton from the Lianbeidian branch store to the county cooperative. While passing through Bei Hougezhuang Village, a bag of cotton fell off the cart; however, Comrade Zhang Yinbao and the driver did not notice.

    A while later, Li Jinyuan, a farmer from Bei Hougezhuang Village, walked past this place. He saw this bag of cotton lying crookedly on the road and thought it might have been dropped by the cooperative's cotton cart he had just encountered. He wanted to chase after it, but the cart was moving fast and he might not be able to catch up. Seeing that it was almost noon, he decided to eat lunch and then take the cotton back to the cooperative.

    After returning home, his younger brother, who could read, saw the words "Luan County Cooperative" printed on the burlap sack, which further proved that the cotton belonged to the cooperative. At that time, some people in the family suggested waiting for the person who lost the cotton to come and look for it. Li Jinyuan said, "Whoever loses something will be anxious. We should send it back earlier so they can be at ease. Besides, we already know that the cooperative lost it. The cooperative belongs to all of us, and the comrades in the cooperative are very busy; letting them come and get it would delay everyone's work, wouldn't it?" He hurriedly finished his meal and rushed to deliver the cotton.

    The midday sun in September was scorching hot. Old Man Li Jinyuan, nearly fifty years old, carried forty or fifty pounds of cotton on his back, sweating profusely from the heat. When he arrived at the cooperative, he handed over the cotton with a smile on his face. The comrades were very moved. One comrade said, "Old man, you could have sent a message and asked us to pick it up. Why did you have to bring it yourself? It's so hot, you must be very tired!" Li Jinyuan said, "The cooperative belongs to all of us. I am a member of the cooperative, which means I am also an ‘owner.’ The cooperative's property is also part of mine, so this little bit of tiredness is nothing!"

### “合作社的财产也有我一份”

    “合作社的财产也有我一份”
    编辑同志：九月十四日，滦南县李土联村供销合作社干部张印宝同志押运了一辆籽棉车，从连北店分销店到县合作社去。路过北侯各庄村时，车上掉下一袋棉花；但张印宝同志和赶车的都没有发觉。
    过了一会儿，北侯各庄村农民李进元走过这里。他看见了这袋棉花在道上歪歪斜斜地倒着，就想到可能是刚才遇见的那辆合作社拉棉大车丢的。他想追着送去，但大车走得很快，未必追得上；眼看天快晌午，就决定吃了饭，再把棉花送回合作社去。
    回家后，他弟弟认识字，一看麻袋上印有“滦南县合作社”的字样，更证明棉花是合作社丢的了。当时家里有人主张等丢棉花的人自己来找。李进元说：“谁丢了东西都要着急；早点送去，好使他安心。再说咱们已经知道这是合作社丢的了。合作社是咱们大伙的，社里同志工作很忙；让他们来取，不是耽误咱大伙的事情吗？”他急急忙忙吃完饭，就赶着送棉花去了。
    九月的晌午太阳是火热的，年近五十的李进元大爷背着四、五十斤棉花，累得热汗直流。到了合作社，他满脸带笑地把棉花交了。同志们都很感动，有一位同志说：“老大爷，捎个信来叫我们去取就行了，为啥要自己送来呢？大热天，多累呀！”李进元说：“合作社是咱们大伙的。我是社员，也就是
    ‘东家’，合作社的财产也有我一份，这点累算得了什么！”
