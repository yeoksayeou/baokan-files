    Chongqing Transportation Company Should Simplify Car Transportation Procedures
    Comrade Editor: In the mountainous regions of Southwest China, automobile transportation is one of the main tools for urban and rural material exchange. After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, the business of the Chongqing State-owned Transportation Company has been continuously expanding, and it is now feeling the pinch of having too few vehicles for the amount of goods. This is mainly because the transportation efficiency is very low, with an average monthly mileage of 900 kilometers. Compared with the 2,000 kilometers advocated by the Ministry of Transportation of the Central Government, there is still a large gap.
    The reason for this low transportation efficiency is mainly that the freight procedures are too cumbersome. In addition to obtaining tax tickets and permits, the following three most time-consuming things must be done in freight transportation:
    First, contract and financial procedures: The consignor contacts the state-owned joint transportation company for freight transportation, and the joint transportation company informs the vehicle owner to dispatch a vehicle. Each time a vehicle is dispatched, regardless of the number of vehicles or whether they are traveling in the city or outside the city, the consignor and the vehicle owner must separately sign a contract with the joint transportation company, with six copies each time. After copying the contract and forms, it must be stamped by five levels of the joint transportation company and three levels or more of the consignor and vehicle owner. Just completing this procedure takes two to three days.
    Second, the problem of loading: There is no plan for loading, and the departments do not cooperate well. Therefore, sometimes the vehicle arrives but the goods are not there, sometimes temporary scaffolding is needed for loading, and sometimes multiple trips are required for loading. When loading, the consignor, vehicle owner, warehouse manager, stevedores, and joint transportation company must all be present, without exception. Therefore, it generally takes two to ten days.
    Third, buying fuel: The oil company's fuel is dozens of miles away, and it takes more than a day each time to buy fuel.
    Due to the above reasons, it takes the consignor and vehicle owner at least three days to complete a freight procedure, generally a week, and sometimes even more than ten days. For example, vehicle numbers 700 to 711 were dispatched on September 6th, but the goods were not shipped until the 12th, the procedures were completed on the 15th, and the vehicle did not start until the 20th, a total delay of 14 days. The average actual driving time for each vehicle per month is only seven or eight days, and the driving efficiency is only 800 to 900 vehicle kilometers.
    I hope that the Chongqing State-owned Transportation Company and the Chongqing Joint Transportation Company will quickly study the above problems and formulate improvement measures.

    重庆运输公司应简化汽车运输手续
    编辑同志：汽车运输在西南山地，是城乡物资交流的主要工具之一。“三反”、“五反”后，重庆市国营运输公司业务不断开展，目前已感到车少货多了。这主要是因为运输效率很低，每月平均行车九百公里；和中央交通部所号召的二千公里相比，还有很大距离。
    造成这种运输效率低的原因，主要是货运手续太繁。货运中的手续，除办理领税票、领通行证外，还要做下面最耽误时间的三件事情：
    第一，是合约和财务手续：货主向国营联运公司接洽货运，联运公司转知车主派车。每次派车时，不管几辆车，不管行驰市区或市外，货主、车主必须分头和联运公司订一次一式六份的合约。把合约和表格抄写之后，要经过联运公司五级盖章和货主、车主各三级以上盖章。仅办理这项手续就需要二天至三天时间。
    第二，是装货问题：装货时没有计划，各部门配合不好。因此，有时车到货不到，有时要临时再搭架子上货，有时要往返几次上货。装货时又必须货主、车主、仓库管理员、搬运工人、联运公司五方面一块到场才能装货，缺一不可。因此，一般需要两天至十天功夫。
    第三，是买油：石油公司的油在数十里路以外的地方，每逢买一次油，需一天以上的时间。
    由于以上原故，货主、车主方面办理一次货运手续，最快要三天，一般要一星期，迟的竟达十天以上才能完成。如七百至七百一十一号汽车，九月六日派车，十二日才发货，十五日办理手续，二十日才开车，总共拖延十四天之久。每部车子每月平均实际行车时间只有七、八天，行车效率也只达到八、九百车公里。
    我希望重庆市国营运输公司和重庆市联运公司，对上述问题迅速加以研究，订出改进办法。
