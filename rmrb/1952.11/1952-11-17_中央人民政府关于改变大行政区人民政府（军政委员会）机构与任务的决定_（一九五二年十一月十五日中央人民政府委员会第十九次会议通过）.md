In order to adapt to the new situation and new tasks of the large-scale planned economic construction and cultural construction that will begin in 1953, the leadership of the Central People's Government over all work should be more unified and concentrated, and the institutions of the Central People's Government should be greatly strengthened; at the same time, the organization of the provincial and municipal people's governments should also be strengthened to increase the responsibility of provincial and municipal leadership. Therefore, the structure and tasks of the Greater Administrative Region People's Government (Military and Administrative Committee) should be changed. To this end, the following decisions are made:

I. All Greater Administrative Region People's Governments or Military and Administrative Committees shall be changed to Administrative Committees. The Greater Administrative Region Administrative Committee is an organ representing the Central People's Government in each region to lead and supervise local governments. The chairman, vice-chairmen, and principal administrative personnel of the Greater Administrative Region Administrative Committee shall be nominated by the Government Administration Council and appointed and removed by the Central People's Government Committee.

II. The four sub-committees of political law, finance and economy, culture and education, and people's supervision, and the office of the original Greater Administrative Region People's Government or Military and Administrative Committee shall remain and be renamed the Political and Legal Committee, the Financial and Economic Committee, the Cultural and Educational Committee, the People's Supervision Committee, and the General Office of the Administrative Committee.

III. All ministries under the original Greater Administrative Region People's Government (Military and Administrative Committee) shall be changed to bureaus (divisions) after the establishment of the Administrative Committee, and some of the bureaus (divisions) shall be directly taken over by the central departments in charge. Hereafter, the bureaus (divisions) established in the greater administrative regions shall be divided into two types in terms of business leadership: one is led by the Greater Administrative Region Administrative Committee or also subject to the guidance of the relevant committees of the Administrative Committee such as the Political and Legal, Financial and Economic, and Cultural and Educational Committees; the other is directly led by the central departments in charge, becoming several specialized administrative bureaus (divisions) established by the central departments in various greater administrative regions, and their establishment belongs to the central competent departments, and is subject to the guidance and supervision of the Greater Administrative Region Administrative Committee and its relevant sub-committees.

IV. The organization of the branch of the Supreme People's Court and the branch of the Supreme People's Procuratorate in the Greater Administrative Region shall remain unchanged, and their relationship with the Greater Administrative Region Administrative Committee and its affiliated Political and Legal Committee shall be the same as the relationship between the Greater Administrative Region People's Government (Military and Administrative Committee) and its affiliated Political and Legal Committee in the past.

The Greater Administrative Region People's Government (Military and Administrative Committee) shall formulate implementation measures based on this decision in light of specific circumstances. However, the bureaus (divisions) that each Greater Administrative Region Administrative Committee should establish and add, and the bureaus (divisions) that the ministries of the Central People's Government should take over, must be proposed by the Greater Administrative Region People's Government (Military and Administrative Committee) in consultation with the central ministries, and reported to the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government for approval before they can be implemented.

This reorganization work should be completed no later than the end of 1952.

    中央人民政府关于改变大行政区人民政府
    （军政委员会）机构与任务的决定
    （一九五二年十一月十五日中央人民政府委员会第十九次会议通过）
    为了适应一九五三年即将开始的全国大规模的有计划的经济建设与文化建设的新形势和新任务，中央人民政府对各项工作的领导，应该更加统一与集中，中央人民政府的机构应该大大地加强；同时，省、市级人民政府的组织也应加强，以加重省、市级领导的责任，因而大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）的机构与任务应予以改变。为此，特作如下的决定：
    一、大行政区人民政府或军政委员会一律改为行政委员会。大区行政委员会是代表中央人民政府在各该地区进行领导与监督地方政府的机关。大区行政委员会主席、副主席和主要的行政人员由政务院提请中央人民政府委员会任免之。
    二、原属于大行政区人民政府或军政委员会的政治法律、财政经济、文化教育、人民监察四个分委员会和办公厅的机构仍然保留，改为行政委员会的政治法律委员会、财政经济委员会、文化教育委员会、人民监察委员会和办公厅。
    三、原大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）下所设各部在行政委员会成立后，一律改为局（处），其中一部分局（处）并交中央各主管部门直接接管。此后大区所设之局（处）从业务领导上区分为两种：一种由各大区行政委员会领导或并受行政委员会的政法、财经、文教等有关委员会的指导；另一种则由中央各主管部门直接领导，成为中央各部门在大区设立的若干专业管理局（处），其建制属于中央的主管部门，并受大区行政委员会及其有关分委员会的指导和监督。
    四、大行政区最高人民法院分院和最高人民检察署分署的组织不变，它们和大区行政委员会及其所属的政治法律委员会的关系与过去和大区人民政府
    （军政委员会）及其所属的政治法律委员会的关系相同。
    大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）应即根据本决定结合具体情况制定实施办法。惟各大区行政委员会应设的和增设的局（处）及中央人民政府各部应接管的局（处），须由各大区人民政府（军政委员会）商同中央各部提出具体方案，连同编制人数报告中央人民政府政务院批准后，始得实行。
    这一改组工作至迟应在一九五二年年底完成。
