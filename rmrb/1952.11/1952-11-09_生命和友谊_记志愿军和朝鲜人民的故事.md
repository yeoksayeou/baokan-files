    Life and Friendship
    —Stories of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People
    Xi Zhi, Guang Cheng, Hou Liang
    On the Korean battlefield, no matter where you go, you can hear and see moving stories of the close unity between the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean people. In a mountain village on the front lines of the Imjin River, the following events occurred:
    In November of last year, a communications company of the Chinese People's Volunteers was stationed in this village. On the evening of the 28th, Cheng Zhiqing, a telephone operator, was on duty at home when he suddenly heard a piercing whistle. A volley of enemy shells flew over and exploded nearby, followed by shouts. He rushed out to investigate and found that the air-raid shelter of the Township People's Committee, located near the hillside, had collapsed. Several local staff members were still inside. Cheng Zhiqing became extremely anxious. Braving the continuously exploding shells, he began to dig. The first person he pulled out was a female teacher named Kim Jin-hee. Although she was still breathing, she was unconscious. Regardless of the cold night wind, Cheng Zhiqing immediately took off his cotton coat and covered Kim Jin-hee with it. At this time, instructor Yang Naitang and Shang Bohua arrived, and everyone continued to dig together. The second person they rescued was the Deputy Chairman of the Township, Park Hoo-do. They also pulled out three other people. For three consecutive hours, they worked to get everyone out, and then rushed them to their own air-raid shelter, wrapped them in coats and blankets, and gave them hot soup. Everyone was busy all night without sleep. At daybreak, they were sent to the medical team for treatment.
    Several months later, the female teacher Kim Jin-hee and the others returned to the village healthy. They were grateful to the Chinese People's Volunteers for saving their lives, and personally brought gifts to the communications company to express their gratitude. The villagers were all moved by this incident and often mentioned the large slogan written by the female teacher Kim Jin-hee at the school gate: "Learn from the Chinese People's Volunteers' great internationalist spirit!"
    On the morning of March 16th this year, the hateful American planes came to bomb the village again. A bomb landed next to the house of Han Guihua, a military dependent, and the house collapsed. Han Guihua, who was washing clothes by the river, saw this and immediately thought of the Chinese People's Volunteer and her little sister who were cooking in the house. She dropped her clothes and ran home. In the smoke, she saw two Chinese People's Volunteers lying on the ground, with flames still reaching towards them. "Ah!" she exclaimed in surprise, the image of Cheng Zhiqing, who rescued the female teacher Kim Jin-hee, vividly appeared in her mind. She immediately rushed forward, regardless of everything, first carrying the Chinese People's Volunteer Zhang Tongke to the air-raid shelter, and then carrying another comrade who had been knocked unconscious into the air-raid shelter. When she returned to the house for the third time, she found her young sister under the stones of the stove—but her sister had been injured in the neck by shrapnel and was crushed by the stones on the stove. Because the rescue was too late, she had stopped breathing. Han Guihua mournfully picked up her dead sister, and looking at the aerial bandits, there was not a tear on her angry face.
    July was the rainy season in Korea, and the floodwaters of the Imjin River rose over the riverbanks, threatening to inundate the homes of the villagers on both sides. The Chinese People's Volunteers stationed there braved the heavy rain and jumped into the water to rescue them. At this time, Hou Zhenhua, the ninth squad leader, who was sick and lying at home, saw the water outside getting higher and higher, and women and children shouting. He decided to go and rescue them, but as soon as he got out of bed, he swayed a few times, his limbs were weak, and he sat down again. Just then, the instructor on the mountain outside shouted to the comrades who were rescuing: "Swim hard! Comrades! We must not allow the lives and property of the Korean people to be lost, this is our responsibility!" Hou Zhenhua heard the instructor's shout and couldn't bear it any longer. He thought: I'll use as much strength as I have, anyway I have to go! I must go! He suddenly stood up and ran to the water's edge.
    Many comrades were swimming back and forth in the water, some carrying grain, some carrying children, and the atmosphere was very tense. Taking advantage of everyone's inattention, Hou Zhenhua quickly jumped into the water and swam straight towards a house—where a woman and an eight or nine-year-old child were anxiously shouting in the water!
    Hou Zhenhua swam to the woman and gestured for them to quickly come with him. The woman, seeing Hou Zhenhua panting, asked Hou Zhenhua to take the child over first, and then come back to save her.
    Time did not allow for much consideration, so Hou Zhenhua picked up the child and swam back.
    The comrades on the shore were busy moving things when they suddenly saw two people slowly swimming over in the water. As they got closer, everyone realized that it was Hou Zhenhua and the child. The comrades exclaimed, "Squad Leader Nine! How did you get here?"
    Hou Zhenhua and the child reached the shore, and the comrades gathered around. The instructor, looking at Hou Zhenhua's thin body, was very moved and advised him to go back and rest. He said urgently, "There...there's still someone over there!" Saying this, he turned around and jumped into the water again. The rapid current carried Hou Zhenhua's body, flying towards the other side. The sound of the waves crashing filled his ears, and he didn't hear the instructor's shout.
    He expended a great deal of effort to swim near the house that was about to be submerged. At this time, the woman had been forced by the water onto the roof. The woman, seeing Hou Zhenhua come to save her again, was moved to tears. She looked at the child who had reached the shore and the Chinese People's Volunteers on the shore waving at her, and quickly swam towards the shore with Hou Zhenhua. However, when Hou Zhenhua swam back to the shore against the current this time, he felt that he had no strength left in his body. But thinking that the woman's life was entirely in his hands, the strong spirit of internationalism supported him, and he used his greatest effort to slowly swim towards the shore.
    The comrades on the shore saw Hou Zhenhua coming and happily greeted him. Just at this moment, a wave suddenly hit, and the two figures disappeared. The comrades immediately became nervous. The instructor said urgently, "Zhou Huiying! Go quickly!" Following Zhou Huiying, several other soldiers hurriedly jumped down to search. But after searching for a long time, they couldn't find them!
    Everyone was as anxious as ants on a hot pot because of this incident. The villagers came to the company headquarters countless times in a day, and the cadres were so worried that they couldn't even eat. Some said that there was probably no hope, but everyone was unwilling to think that way.
    Originally, the floodwaters had washed Hou Zhenhua and the woman onto a hillside, and they had both climbed up. Because Hou Zhenhua was already ill, and then soaked in the water and drenched in the rain, his illness worsened. The woman carried Comrade Hou Zhenhua, who had shared life and death with her, to an old villager's home. The old woman heard that this Chinese People's Volunteer had been washed up while saving the villagers, and she was very moved. The old woman and the woman guarded him day and night with meticulous care.
    A few days later, Hou Zhenhua's illness gradually improved, and the woman, fearing that her family would worry, decided to quickly send Hou Zhenhua back to the unit. On this day, some comrades and villagers from the company went to the river again to look, and suddenly saw two women supporting a Chinese People's Volunteer coming over, which surprised everyone. Looking closer, "Ah! Squad Leader Nine is back!" And the ones supporting Squad Leader Nine were the woman who had been rescued the day before and an old woman. Comrades and villagers alike burst into tears of joy. The comrades said, "If it weren't for this elder sister, our Squad Leader Nine might not have come back! We are truly grateful to you!" The villagers said:
    "If it weren't for the Chinese People's Volunteers, our whole village would have been washed away by the flood long ago! You are truly our saviors!"

    生命和友谊
    ——记志愿军和朝鲜人民的故事
    习之、光诚、侯良
    在朝鲜战地，无论你走到那里，都能听到和见到志愿军和朝鲜人民亲密团结的动人故事。临津江前线的某个山村，曾发生过这样几件事情：
    去年十一月，志愿军某部通讯连在这个村驻下了。二十八日晚，正轮到电话员成治清在家值班，忽听一阵刺耳的啸声，敌人一排炮弹飞过来，在附近爆炸了，接着又听见有人叫喊。他急忙跑出去察看，靠山坡处的面人民委员会的防空洞被打塌了。里边还住有几个地方工作人员哩。这可把成治清急坏了。他冒着不断爆炸的炮弹，动手就扒。第一个扒出来的是女教师金真姬，虽然呼吸还没断，但已人事不省了。成治清不顾夜风的寒冷，立刻把自己的棉衣脱下来，盖在金真姬的身上。这时指导员杨乃堂和尚伯华都赶来，大家一起又扒。救活的第二个人是面副委员长朴厚道，另外又扒出三个人。连续三个钟头，大家才把人都扒出来，又急忙把他们背到自己的防空洞里，用大衣、毯子包起来，给他们灌热汤，大家忙了一夜没睡觉。等天一亮，就把他们送到卫生队去医治。
    几个月后，女教师金真姬和其余几个人健康地回到村上来了。他们感激志愿军救活了他们的生命，并亲自带着礼物到通讯连来道谢。村里的老乡们都为这件事情所感动，常常念着女教师金真姬在学校门口写下的一条大标语：“学习志愿军伟大的国际主义精神！”
    今年三月十六日上午，可恶的美国飞机又来轰炸这个村庄，一颗炸弹落在军属韩桂花的房子旁边。把房子震塌了。正在河边洗衣服的韩桂花看见了，立刻想到正在屋里做饭的志愿军和他的小妹妹，急忙丢下衣服往家里跑。烟雾里，他看见两个志愿军战士倒在地上，火苗还不断地伸向他们。“啊！”她惊愕了一声，抢救女教员金真姬的成治清的面影鲜明地出现在她脑海里面。她立刻不顾一切地跑上去，先背起志愿军战士张同科就往防空洞里跑，回来又把震昏了的另一个同志背进防空洞。她第三次又返回房子去时，在锅台的石头下边找到了年幼的妹妹——但妹妹已被弹片打伤了勃子，又被锅台上的石头压住，因急救晚了，已断了呼吸。韩桂花沉痛地抱起已死的妹妹，望着空中的强盗，她愤怒的脸上没有一滴眼泪。
    七月，正是朝鲜的雨季，临津江的大水涨过了江岸，眼看两岸村上老乡的房子就要被淹没了。驻地的志愿军战士们冒着大雨，跃入水中去抢救。这时生病躺在家里的九班长侯振华，看见外面的水越来越大，妇女、孩子在喊叫，他决心也要去抢救，可是刚一下炕，身子幌了几幌，四肢无力，他又坐下来。正好这时指导员在外面山上对抢救的同志们喊：“努力游呀！同志们！我们决不能让朝鲜人民的生命财产受到损失，这是我们的责任啊！”侯振华听见了指导员的喊声，再也耐不住了，他想：我有多大气力就使多大气力，反正我要去！一定要去！他忽的一下站了起来，向水边跑去。
    许多同志都在水里来回游动着，有的扛着粮食，有的背着小孩，情绪非常紧张。侯振华趁大家不注意，很快地跳进水里，直向一所房子游去——那里有一个妇女和一个八、九岁的孩子在水里焦急地呼喊！
    侯振华游到妇女那里，用手比划着，让他们赶快和他一起过去，那妇女看见侯振华气喘嘘嘘的样子，就先让侯振华把孩子抱过去，回来再救她。
    时间不容过多的考虑，侯振华抱起孩子就往回游。
    岸上的同志正在忙着搬东西，突然看见水里又慢慢地游过来两个人，近了，大家才看出是侯振华和那个孩子。同志们都惊呼起来：“九班长！你怎么也来了？”
    侯振华和孩子都上了岸，同志们凑过来，指导员望着侯振华瘦弱的身体，心里很感动，劝他回去休息。他急促地说：“那边……还有一个人！”说着，扭头就又跳进水里，急流送着侯振华的身体，飞快向那边流去，浪花互相冲击的响声，充满了他的耳鼓，他没有听见指导员的喊声。
    他费了很大的气力才游到那所将要被淹没的房子附近，这时，那位妇女已经被水逼到房顶上了。妇女看见侯振华又来救她，感动得直掉泪。她望着上了岸的孩子和岸上的志愿军同志都在向着她招手，就急忙和侯振华往岸上游来。可是侯振华这次逆水再向岸上游来时，身上已经觉得没有力气了，但他想到这位妇女的生命完全在他身上，强烈的国际主义精神支持着他，他用最大的努力慢慢地向岸游去。
    岸上的同志们看见侯振华来了，都在向他欢喜的招呼，正在这个时候，突然一个浪头打来，两个人影不见了。同志们的心里立刻紧张起来。指导员急促地说：“周惠英！快去！”随着周惠英又有几个战士也急忙跟着跳下去寻找。可是找了半天，哪里找得到呢！
    为着这件事，大家都急得像热锅上的蚂蚁一样，老乡们也不知一天到连部来多少趟，干部们愁的连饭都吃不下去。有的说恐怕没有希望了，但大家都不愿意这样想。
    原来，大水把侯振华和这位妇女冲到一个山坡上，他们都爬起来了。因为侯振华本来就有病，又经水一泡，雨一淋，病又重了。这位妇女就把这位同生死的侯振华同志背到一家老乡家里，那家老大娘听说这位志愿军是为救老乡而被冲来的，心里很感动，老大娘和这位妇女日夜周到的守护着他。
    几天以后，侯振华的病渐渐好了些，那位妇女怕家里担心，就决定赶快把侯振华送回部队。这一天，连里一些同志和老乡们又到河边去望望，忽然看见那边有两位妇女架着一个志愿军同志过来了，大家都很奇怪。走近一看，“啊！九班长回来了！”而架着九班长的正是前天被救的那个妇女和一位老大娘。同志们和村里的人一时都欢喜得掉下眼泪。同志们说：“要不是这位大嫂，我们九班长也许回不来了！我们真感激你们！”老乡们说：
    “要不是志愿军，我们全村的人还不早被大水冲走了！你们真是我们的救命恩人哪！”
