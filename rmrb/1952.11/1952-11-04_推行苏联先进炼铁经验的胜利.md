The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Ironmaking Plant, under the guidance of Soviet experts, and through the efforts of all workers and technical personnel over the past two years, has finally completed two major reforms in ironmaking methods, namely the implementation of the "full blast, fast charging, smooth operation method" and "the use of sintered ore to produce low-silicon iron." This is a major victory in the application and promotion of advanced Soviet science and technology in China's steel industry. The implementation of the full blast, fast charging, smooth operation method has greatly increased the pig iron production of this ironmaking plant. The average utilization coefficient of the effective volume of each blast furnace in the ironmaking plant has decreased from 1.209 in 1950 to 0.866 in September of this year, and the average output of pig iron has increased by 39%; the average ratio of coke used per ton of iron has also decreased from 1.068 in 1950 to 0.866 in August of this year. The success of using sintered ore to produce low-silicon iron has opened up a new path for China to use lean ore to make iron and shorten the steelmaking process. Now all blast furnaces in this ironmaking plant can universally use sintered ore to produce low-silicon iron. The use of sintered ore has increased to 90%; the production of low-silicon iron has also reached 90% of the total pig iron production, and the quality of the products is very good. For example, the administrative regulations stipulate that the silicon content of first-grade steelmaking pig iron should not exceed 0.9%, but each blast furnace has been able to consistently reduce it to around 0.6%. At the same time, due to the success of these experiments, the technical personnel and workers have further improved their understanding of advanced Soviet experience, and therefore more advanced Soviet technologies, such as protecting tapholes, furnace top regulation methods, and steam blowing, have been quickly promoted and achieved remarkable results in the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant.

However, the promotion of advanced Soviet experience in this ironmaking plant was not smooth sailing at the beginning. Their experimental work was a struggle against outdated and conservative bourgeois technical viewpoints before they achieved victory.

As early as August 1950, when Soviet experts from the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry came to this plant, they proposed the use of the "full blast, fast charging, smooth operation method" in blast furnaces. Soviet experts pointed out that if iron is smelted using a blast volume equal to 2.2 times the effective volume of the blast furnace per minute, coupled with coordination in terms of uniform raw material size and uniform charging, the output of pig iron would rapidly increase. However, when conducting the experiment, it encountered obstacles from the conservative thinking of some technical personnel. Some technical personnel said: "Increasing the blast volume will easily cause fluctuations in the reduction and melting process of the raw materials in the furnace; the changes in the furnace are unstable, and the output and quality of iron will be affected." Some people also said: "As the blast volume increases, the ratio of coke to iron will also increase, which will increase the cost of ironmaking." In short, these technical personnel believed that the output of the blast furnace had already "reached its peak," and increasing such a large blast volume had no basis in Anglo-American ironmaking theory. However, facts speak louder than words. After several months of experimentation at this ironmaking plant, the result of each blast furnace implementing full blast volume operation was a significant reduction in the effective utilization coefficient and coke-iron ratio, and an increase in pig iron production. The ideological resistance encountered in promoting the advanced experience of using sintered ore to produce low-silicon iron was also very strong. The iron ore in this area is mostly lean ore, with a low iron content, and cannot be directly charged into the blast furnace for ironmaking. In the past, the ore raw materials used for ironmaking were mostly briquettes made from lean ore through proportioning, which was costly and had a high silicon content. In September 1950, after Soviet experts carefully studied the situation of this ironmaking plant, based on the experience of some Soviet ironmaking plants, they proposed to use a large amount of sintered ore to produce low-silicon iron. Soviet experts pointed out that if the use of sintered ore to produce low-silicon iron is successful, production can be improved from both the ironmaking raw materials and the steelmaking process. From the perspective of ironmaking raw materials: this ironmaking plant originally used a large amount of briquettes to make iron. Although both briquettes and sintered ore are made from lean ore after mineral processing, the production cost of briquettes is 40% higher than that of sintered ore. This is because briquette forming is manually complex and takes a long time to calcine; while sintered ore has a short calcination time and can be produced using mechanized methods. From the perspective of the steelmaking process: steelmaking using pig iron with excessively high silicon content must first undergo refining in a preliminary refining furnace to reduce the silicon content of the iron. If the production of pig iron with a silicon content below 0.9% is successful, the ironmaking plant can directly send the molten iron to the steelmaking open hearth furnace, thereby shortening the steelmaking production process and reducing steelmaking costs by 10%.

When the leadership of the ironmaking plant decided to conduct the experiment of using sintered ore to produce low-silicon iron in a certain blast furnace, some technical personnel in the plant, especially some engineers who had worked in the plant before the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, believed that this experiment would not be successful. Because they remembered that during the puppet Manchukuo period, when Japanese imperialism established this ironmaking plant, they began to conduct experiments on using sintered ore to produce low-silicon iron, but each of their experiments ended in failure. The Japanese took the ore from this area to various capitalist countries in Europe and the United States for research, and also specially invited American ironmaking experts. However, the result was still the same. The so-called scientific conclusion drawn by the American ironmaking experts was: "In this area, to use lean ore to make iron, it is necessary to take the path of briquettes. There is no sintered ore in the world that is more unsuitable for ironmaking than the sintered ore in this area." As for the production of low-silicon iron, these technical personnel also clearly remembered that after repeated research and experiments by the Japanese, the silicon content of steelmaking pig iron made from sintered ore was generally often higher than 1.2%, and could not be directly used for steelmaking. Therefore, the Japanese concluded that the ore in this area was special and could not be used to produce low-silicon iron with sintered ore. Finally, they had to mainly use briquettes; the steel plant also had to adopt the "double-linked steelmaking method."

During the experiment, the leadership of this ironmaking plant not only concentrated the relevant technical personnel to the experimental work posts, but also mobilized and organized the raw materials, air supply, and construction departments to cooperate. According to the spirit of the suggestions of Soviet experts, they divided the experimental work into two steps: the first step was to experiment with sintered ore, and the second step was to produce low-silicon iron. In this way, after several months of repeated research and experiments, this technically reforming undertaking of great significance was finally successful. What many technical experts in capitalist countries in the past thought was impossible has now become a reality.

Why can advanced Soviet experience be widely promoted in this ironmaking plant? The most important reason is that the Party and administrative leaders of this plant believe in the superiority of Soviet science and technology, have the confidence to persist in promoting advanced Soviet experience, and can promptly solve various ideological and technical problems in the experiment. For example, in the early stages of promoting "full blast volume operation" and "using sintered ore to produce low-silicon iron," due to the lack of experience of the experimental personnel and the lack of proficiency in operation, some accidents occurred, and even temporarily affected iron production. At this time, some technical personnel hesitated and wavered, and some said: Our ironmaking plant is not the Kuznetsk Iron and Steel Plant in the Soviet Union after all! The equipment is backward and cannot be promoted; some remained silent, and even suggested "stopping the promotion." However, the leading cadres of this ironmaking plant were not shaken by these pessimistic and disappointed remarks. They believed that as long as they paid attention to solving various difficulties in the experiment in a timely manner and persisted, the experiment would definitely be successful. Therefore, on the one hand, they organized cadres and activists from the CCP's Party organizations, the Communist Youth League, and the trade union to widely publicize the importance of experimental work and criticized the outdated and conservative thinking of some technical personnel; on the other hand, they formed a core of outstanding technical personnel and experienced veteran workers in the plant, who were specifically responsible for experimental work. At the same time, they also stipulated that the plant's technical seminars, technical research groups, and production reporting meetings should all revolve around the experiment of technical transformation. In this way, the ideological obstacles and technical difficulties encountered in the experiment were promptly resolved; from the specific operation of technical transformation to technical inspection, from the supply and management of raw materials to the overhaul of various equipment, the experimental work was vigorously coordinated. Another important reason for the success of promoting advanced Soviet experience is that from the beginning of learning advanced Soviet experience to experimental operation; from experimental operation to comprehensive promotion, the administrative leadership of this plant formulated a relatively complete plan and system in advance. At the same time, in promoting these advanced experiences, they also paid attention to discovering and summarizing new technical improvements of the plant's employees, and supplemented them to the technical operating procedures for promulgation and implementation throughout the plant. This planning and strong organizational work played a significant role in promoting and consolidating advanced experience.

The brilliant achievements of advanced Soviet science and technology in this ironmaking plant once again prove that Soviet socialist science and technology armed with Marxism-Leninism are the most advanced, correct, and infinitely creative science and technology in the world. At the same time, it also clearly tells all our engineering and technical personnel that only by thoroughly eliminating the decadent technical viewpoints of capitalism, arming ourselves with advanced socialist technical theory, truly integrating with the workers and giving play to their initiative and creativity, can we make brilliant achievements in the great construction cause of the new China.

    推行苏联先进炼铁经验的胜利
    新华社记者  谷峰
    国营鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂在苏联专家的指导下，两年来经过全体工人与技术人员的努力，终于完成了炼铁方法上的两项重大改革，即推行“全风快料顺行法”和“使用烧结矿制炼低矽铁”。这是在我国钢铁工业上运用和推行先进的苏联科学技术所获得的一个重大胜利。全风快料顺行法的推行，大大提高了这个炼铁厂的生铁产量。炼铁厂各个高炉有效容积的平均利用系数，已由一九五○年的一点二○九，降低到今年九月份的零点八六六，生铁的平均产量提高了百分之三十九；炼一吨铁所用的焦炭平均比率，也由一九五○年的一点零六八，降低到今年八月份的零点八六六。使用烧结矿制炼低矽铁的成功，给我国利用贫矿石炼铁和缩短炼钢过程，开辟了一条新的道路。现在这个炼铁厂的所有高炉，已能普遍地使用烧结矿制炼低矽铁。烧结矿的使用提高到百分之九十；低矽铁的生产也达到了生铁总产量的百分之九十，而且产品的质量很好。如行政方面规定一级制钢生铁的含矽量至多不能超过百分之零点九，但各个高炉已能经常降到百分之零点六左右。同时，由于这些试验的成功，技术人员和工人对于苏联先进经验的认识更进一步提高了，因而更多的苏联先进技术，如保护出铁口、炉顶调剂法以及蒸汽鼓风等，都很快地在鞍山钢铁厂推行并获得了显著成绩。
    但是，苏联先进经验在这个炼铁厂开始推行时并不是一帆风顺的。他们的实验工作，是和陈旧、保守的资产阶级技术观点进行了一场斗争，才取得胜利的。
    早在一九五○年八月，中央重工业部的苏联专家来到这个厂时，曾经提出在高炉使用“全风快料顺行法”的建议。苏联专家指出：如果使用每分钟等于高炉有效容积二点二倍的风量炼铁，再加上原料大小均匀和下料均匀等方面的配合，生铁的产量就会迅速提高。可是当进行实验时，却遇到了某些技术人员保守思想的阻碍。有些技术人员说：“增加了风量，原料在炉内还原、熔化的过程容易波动；炉内的变化情况不稳定，铁的产量和质量就要受到影响。”也有的人说：“风量增加，焦、铁的比率随之提高，就会提高了炼铁成本。”总之，这些技术人员认为：高炉的产量已经“到了顶”，增加这样多的风量，在英美的炼铁理论上是没有根据的。然而事实就是最好的说明，这个炼铁厂经过数月的实验，各高炉执行全风量操作的结果，有效利用系数和焦铁比率大大降低，生铁的产量提高了。在推行烧结矿制炼低矽铁的先进经验中，所遇到的思想抵抗也是十分顽强的。这个地区的铁矿多为贫矿，含铁成分少，不能直接投入高炉炼铁。过去炼铁使用的矿石原料，大多是由贫矿石经过配制的团矿，成本既高，铁的含矽成分又多。一九五○年九月，苏联专家详细地研究了这个炼铁厂的情况以后，根据苏联某些炼铁厂的经验，提出大量使用烧结矿制炼低矽铁的建议。苏联专家指出：如果用烧结矿制炼低矽铁成功，就能够从炼铁原料和炼钢过程两方面一齐改进生产。从炼铁原料来说：这个炼铁厂原来是使用大量团矿炼铁的，团矿和烧结矿虽然都是由贫矿石经过选矿制成，但团矿的生产成本要比烧结矿高百分之四十。因为团矿成型手工复杂，烧成时间长；而烧结矿的烧成时间短，并且可以利用机械化的方式生产。从炼钢过程来说：用含矽过高的生铁炼钢，必须先经过预备精炼炉的精炼，降低铁的含矽成分。如果制炼含矽在百分之零点九以下的生铁成功，炼铁厂就可以直接将铁水送到炼钢平炉，从而缩短了炼钢的生产过程，可以降低炼钢成本百分之十。
    炼铁厂的领导方面，决定在某号高炉进行烧结矿制炼低矽铁的试验时，厂里的某些技术人员，特别是抗日战争胜利前就在该厂工作的某些工程师，都认为这种试验是不可能成功的。因为他们记得：在伪满时，当日本帝国主义建立了这个炼铁厂后，就着手进行过烧结矿制炼低矽铁的试验，但他们每次的试验都宣告失败了。日本人把这个地区的矿石拿到欧美各资本主义国家去研究，并且还特别邀请了美国的炼铁专家。然而结果仍是一样，美国炼铁专家得出来的所谓科学的结论是：“这个地区利用贫矿石炼铁，一定要走团矿的道路。世界上再没有任何一种烧结矿，比这个地区的烧结矿更不适宜炼铁的需要了。”至于制炼低矽铁，这些技术人员也还清楚地记得：日本人经过多次研究试验的结果，用烧结矿炼出的制钢生铁，一般含矽量经常高在百分之一点二以上，不能直接炼钢。因此日本人断定这个地区的矿石特殊，不能使用烧结矿制炼低矽铁。最后，他们不得不以使用团矿为主；炼钢厂也不得不采用“双联炼钢法”了。
    在试验期间，这个炼铁厂的领导方面，除把有关的技术人员，都集中到实验工作的岗位上来，还发动与组织了原料、送风、工务等部门进行配合。他们根据苏联专家建议的精神，又把实验工作分成两个步骤：第一步是试验用烧结矿，第二步是制炼低矽铁。这样，经过数月的反复研究，实验，这一项具有重大意义的技术改革，终于获得了成功。过去许多资本主义国家的技术专家所认为不可能的事情，今天却变成了事实。
    苏联的先进经验，为什么能在这个炼铁厂得到广泛地推广呢？最重要的原因，是这个厂的党和行政方面的领导干部，相信苏联科学技术的优越性，具有坚持推行苏联先进经验的信心，并且在试验中，能够及时地解决各种思想与技术问题。例如在推行“全风量操作”和“使用烧结矿制炼低矽铁”的初期，由于实验人员缺少经验，操作不够熟练，曾经发生过一些事故，甚至暂时地影响了铁的产量。这时，某些技术人员就徘徊、动摇起来，有的说：我们的炼铁厂毕竟不是苏联的库兹涅茨克钢铁厂呀！设备落后，无法推行；有的袖手缄默，甚至建议“停止推行”。可是这个炼铁厂的领导干部，并没有被这些悲观失望的论调所动摇。他们相信：只要及时地注意解决实验中的各种困难，坚持下去，实验是一定会成功的。于是，他们一方面组织了中共党的组织、青年团和工会的干部和积极分子，广泛地宣传实验工作的重要意义，并且批判了某些技术人员陈旧的保守思想；另一方面，他们把厂里一部分优秀的技术人员与有经验的老工人，组成一个核心，专门负责实验工作。同时，他们又规定厂里的技术座谈会、技术研究组和生产汇报会议，都围绕着技术改革的实验而进行工作。这样，在实验中所遇到的思想障碍与技术困难，就得到了及时的解决；从技术改革的具体操作到技术检验，从原料的供应、管理到各种设备的检修，都有力地配合了实验工作。推行苏联先进经验获得成功的另一个重要原因，就是从开始学习苏联先进经验到试验操作；从试验操作到全面推广的整个过程，这个厂的行政领导方面，都预先制定了一套比较完整的计划与制度。同时他们在推行这些先进经验中，还注意了发现与总结本厂职工新的技术改进，将其增补到技术操作规程中公布全厂执行。这种计划性与强有力的组织工作，对于推行与巩固先进经验，起了重大的作用。
    苏联先进科学技术在这个炼铁厂显示出的辉煌成就，再一次证明了：用马克思列宁主义武装起来的苏联社会主义的科学技术，是世界上最先进、最正确和具有无穷创造力的科学技术。同时他也明确地告诉了我们所有的工程技术人员，只有彻底肃清资本主义腐朽的技术观点，用社会主义先进的技术理论武装自己，真正和工人结合并发挥积极性与创造性，才会在新中国伟大的建设事业中作出辉煌的业绩。
