A Record of a Flourishing Primary Market in the Cotton-Producing Area of Henan
　　Li Lu
　　Forty miles north of Zhengzhou lies Gu Xing Town, the cotton production center of Chenggao County, Henan Province.
　　During the cotton harvest season, cotton farmers carry large and small baskets, picking the snow-white cotton bolls in the vast cotton fields. These cotton flowers blooming everywhere bring a happy life to the cotton farmers and a prosperous scene to the market.
　　After the new cotton was put on the market, the market in Gu Xing Town was particularly lively. At the two cotton collection points of the cooperative, farmers selling cotton lined up for half a street from morning till dusk. After selling their cotton, the cotton farmers immediately flocked to the entrances of the state-owned department store and the cooperative. Many people also gathered in front of several grocery stores, some crowding around a sundries stall. They used the money they had just earned from selling cotton to exchange for large quantities of grain, farm tools, and daily necessities.
　　What changes has this market undergone since the new cotton was put on the market?
　　First of all, the sales volume of grain has greatly increased this year. According to statistics from the local grain company's outlet, the grain sold in the one and a half months starting in August was 11% more than the total grain sales in the first half of this year, and 2.6 times that of October and November last year. Among them, fine grains sold far more than coarse grains. Fine grains accounted for more than 70% of the total sales of various grains in August.
　　After selling their cotton, the cotton farmers also want to buy a large number of industrial products. The turnover of the department store's outlet here in mid-September increased more than threefold compared to early August. The counter, which was five rooms wide, was often crowded with people. Cotton farmers dressed in fine cloth clothes bought bedding material made of fancy serge, and socks and towels of various colors. An old lady bought more than ten feet of Soviet printed fabric. I asked her who she was going to make clothes for, and she held up two fingers and said: "A pair of little granddaughters. If I only sew for the younger one, the older one won't agree. If I buy, I have to buy a share for both of them!" With a smile, she walked to a sundries stall diagonally opposite.
　　Gu Xing Town has more than 700 households, and more than 70% of the households have flashlights. The department store sells several dozens of batteries every day. In the past, cotton farmers mostly used small earthenware pots to hold boiled water, but now many cotton farmers use thermos bottles with bamboo shells. Before liberation, farmers would only light a cotton oil lamp with a single wick when working at night, but now kerosene lamps are commonly used. According to statistics from the cooperative's outlet, an average of 60 jin of kerosene is sold every day in August, more than double the same period last year. Few cotton farmers use ash water to wash clothes anymore, and most of them use soap. On rainy days, many men and women wear rubber shoes.
　　After the cotton farmers' purchasing power increased, they not only demanded a large number of industrial products, but also demanded industrial products of good quality. Young women are no longer very interested in "Four-in-One" brand soap, but want "Lux" and "Green Treasure" brand soap. Among the large quantities of fabrics sold, the four types of fabrics with higher prices, such as serge, woolen cloth, and water moon blue, accounted for more than 80% of the total sales of various fabrics. Last December, the state-owned department store's outlet transferred a batch of inferior "Three Horse Head" brand blue cloth, and not even one bolt has been sold to this day. The person in charge of the outlet said: For example, when cotton farmers buy shoe upper cloth! When they walk in, they usually ask first:
　　"Do you have 'Charge' woolen cloth?" If not, they will ask: "What about canvas?" If there isn't any, then they will want serge and straight tribute cloth. Some cotton farmers turn around and leave when they ask if there are none of the first two. Therefore, these types of fabrics are often out of stock. Once, a bolt of canvas was bought back from Zhengzhou, and it was sold out in small pieces of eight inches or a foot in no time.
　　Not only are the state-owned department stores and cooperatives doing good business, but also private stores are doing very well. Zhao Guangfu, a private merchant, set up a Jing goods stall, and sold more than 400,000 yuan in less than an hour on the morning of September 17th. A middle-aged couple bought six pieces of clothing material at his cloth stall at one time, mostly serge of various colors. At another cloth stall diagonally opposite, one person was issuing invoices and two people were measuring sizes, but they were still overwhelmed. The business in other grocery stores, sundries stores, blacksmith shops, and stationery stalls was also much better than before the new cotton was put on the market. A small carrying pole selling children's toys issued more than 30 invoices in half a day, and many farmers are willing to spend money to buy toys and bring them home to their little babies.
　　Cotton farmers need to purchase a large number of means of production even more. When walking through the villages and alleys of the cotton-producing area, you can see new ox carts and farm tools placed in front of many newly built houses, and fat cattle and donkeys resting in the shade of the trees. According to the village cadres of Ji Gongmiao Village, the village has added six ox carts, more than 40 head of livestock, and 14 new-style farm tools this year. This year's autumn crops have been affected by drought, and many cotton farmers are preparing to buy waterwheels after picking the cotton. The village bought back three waterwheels in August. As for the purchase of small farm tools, it is too numerous to calculate. Nine cotton farmers have built new tile-roofed houses. The village has already purchased more than 140,000 jin of fertilizer this year.
　　What things are the cotton farmers preparing to buy to arrange their lives after selling all the cotton this year? I visited cotton farmer Qi Baohua. His family of five cultivates 15 mu of land, of which 7 mu are planted with cotton. Last year, his family bought 72 feet of serge and 40 feet of white fine cloth to make coats and quilts. This year, they also plan to buy 58 feet of fine cloth to change a quilt lining, make two bed sheets, and sew a set of cotton clothes for each of the two children. Secondly, they need to purchase three shi of grain, two shi of black beans (for fertilizer), and a pair of iron cages. These few large expenses alone will cost more than 900,000 yuan. Other small farm tools and daily necessities such as socks have not yet been calculated, and he also plans to repair the house. I asked how many households like him there were in their village, and he said: "Among ten households, two are better than me, two are not as good as me, and the remaining six are about the same as me."
　　The prosperous scene of the Gu Xing Town market is continuing to develop. Now, dozens of ox-drawn or horse-drawn carts, loaded with cotton bales, travel between the town and the road leading to the railway station every day. The cart drivers hum small tunes and wave their whips, and the songs and dust ripple in the sky above the vehicles at the same time. When these vehicles return to the town from the station, merchants who have transported goods from Zhengzhou, Xinxiang, and other places conveniently hitch a ride on the carts. The cotton farmers who are picking new cotton in the cotton fields on both sides of the road, when they see the cotton they planted being transported to the railway station in bags and sent to large factories in the city, and when they see batches of industrial products and grain being transported from the railway station to the town, they often cannot help but smile.

    记河南产棉区一个初级市场的繁荣景象
    黎路
    由郑州北上四十里，就到了河南成皋县产棉中心的古荥镇。
    在棉花收获的季节，棉农们携带着大小箩筐，在一望无边的棉田里采摘着雪白的棉朵。这些遍地盛开的棉花，给棉农们带来了幸福的生活，也给市场带来了繁荣的景象。
    新棉上市以后，古荥镇市场上显得格外热闹。合作社的两个收花处门口，从早晨直到黄昏，售棉的农民排了半条街。棉农们卖棉花，立即拥向国营百货公司和合作社的门口。也有不少的人聚集在几家杂货铺前，有的围住一个碎货摊。他们用刚才卖棉花得来的钱，换走了大批的粮食、农具和日常生活用品。
    新棉上市后，这个市场究竟起了哪些变化呢？
    首先是今年粮食销售量大大增加了。据当地粮食公司门市部统计，在八月份开始的一个半月中卖出的粮食，比今年上半年的粮食总销量还多百分之十一；等于去年十和十一两月份的二点六倍。其中细粮又远比粗粮卖得多。八月份细粮的销售量占全月各种粮食总销售量的百分之七十强。
    棉农们卖出棉花以后，还要购买大批的工业品。这里的百货公司门市部，九月中旬的营业额比八月上旬增加三倍多。五间房子宽的柜台前，经常站满了人。身穿细布衣裳的棉农们，有的买花哔叽的被料，有的买各种颜色的袜子和毛巾。一位老大娘买了一丈多苏联花布，我问她准备给谁做衣服，她伸出两个手指头说：“一对小孙女，光给小的缝，大的不依，要买就得都有一份！”说着她就笑眯眯地走到斜对面的一家杂货摊前去了。
    古荥镇乡有七百多户人家，百分之七十以上的户都有手电筒。百货公司的电池，每天都要销出好几打。过去棉农们大都用小瓦罐装开水，现在许多棉农都用竹壳暖水瓶。解放前，农民晚上作事只肯点一根灯草的棉油灯，现在却普遍用起煤油灯来了。据合作社门市部统计，八月份平均每天要卖六十斤煤油，比去年同期增加一倍多。棉农们洗衣服已经很少有人再用灰水，大多数都用肥皂了。落雨天，男男女女很多都穿着胶鞋。
    棉农购买力提高以后，不仅要求大量工业品，而且要求质量好的工业品了。青年妇女们对“四合一”牌香皂已经不大感兴趣，而要“力士”和“绿宝”牌香皂了。在销售的大批布匹当中，哔叽呢、水月蓝等四种价钱较高的布，占了各种布匹总销量的百分之八十以上。去年十二月间国营百货公司门市部调来了一批较次的“三马头”牌青布，直到现在连一匹还没卖完。该门市部的负责人说：比如棉农们购买鞋面布吧！走进门来，照例是开口先问：
    “有冲锋呢没有？”要是没有，接着就问：“帆布呢？”再没有的话，才肯要哔叽呢和直贡呢。有的棉农问到前两种都没有时，回头就走。因此，这几种布匹就经常脱销。有一次从郑州买回一匹帆布，没有好久就八寸、一尺地零卖光了。
    不仅国营百货公司和合作社的生意好，私营商店的生意也很好。私商赵光甫摆了个京货摊，九月十七日早上不到一个钟点就卖了四十多万元。一对中年夫妇一次就在他的布摊上买了六件衣料，大都是各种颜色的哔叽呢。斜对面的另一个布摊上，一个人开发票，两个人量尺码，还是应接不暇。其他各杂货铺、碎货店、打铁铺和文具摊上的生意，也都比新棉上市前要好得多。一个卖儿童玩具的小挑子，半天就开出三十多张发票，不少的农民都肯花钱买玩具，带回家去给他们的小宝宝。
    棉农们更需要购进大批的生产资料。从棉区的村头巷尾走过时，可以看见许多新盖的房屋门前，放着新添的大车和农具，肥壮的牛、驴在林荫下歇晌。据纪公庙村的村干部说：该村今年新添了六辆大车、四十多头牲口、十四部新式农具，今年秋庄稼曾经受到旱灾，许多棉农准备摘了棉花后购买水车，八月份村上就买回了三部水车。至于添购的小件农具就多得难以计算了。有九家棉农新盖了大瓦房。全村今年已经购买的肥料在十四万斤以上。
    今年棉农们卖出全部棉花以后，还准备买进哪些东西来安排自己的生活呢？我访问了棉农齐宝华，他全家五口人，种着十五亩地，其中有七亩地种棉花。去年他家曾经买了七十二尺哔叽呢和四十尺白细布，做了大衣和被子，今年还打算买五十八尺细布，换一床被里，做两床铺单，再给两个小孩各缝一套棉衣。其次还需要购进三石粮食，两石黑豆（做肥料）和一对铁笼。仅这几笔大宗开支，就要九十多万元。其他小件农具和袜子等生活用品还未计算在内，他还打算修理一下房子。我问他们村上像他这样的户有多少，他说：“十户当中，有两户比我强，两户赶不上我，其余六户和我差不多。”
    古荥镇市场的繁荣景象正在继续发展。现在，整天都有几十辆用牛或马拉的大车，满载着棉包，来往在从镇上通往火车站的马路上。赶车工人哼着小调，扬着响鞭，歌声和尘土同时荡漾在车辆的上空。当这些车辆从车站回镇时，从郑州、新乡等地贩货回来的商人，就顺便把货物搭乘在大车上。大路两旁的棉田里，正在采摘新棉花的棉农们，看到自己种的棉花一包一包地运上火车，向城市大工厂里送去，又看到一批一批的工业品和粮食，从火车站运到镇上来时，他们往往情不自禁地笑起来。
