To cultivate the talent needed for large-scale economic construction, the departments directly under the Northeast People's Government and various provinces and cities are actively formulating long-term plans for cadre training. Currently, the Northeast Industry Department, the Public Security Department, the Lüda City, and Liaoxi Province are making relatively rapid and successful progress. The Northeast Industry Department has already collected basic information on cadre training plans and is currently studying various specific issues and beginning to outline the plans. When studying the number of cadres that need to be increased, the department first studied the number of technical cadres needed for production and capital construction. To facilitate the research of their tasks by subordinate bureaus, it uniformly stipulated five types of indicators, namely: indicators for training cadres for national and local industries, indicators for long-term cadre training, indicators for short-term rotation training, indicators for cadre promotion, and indicators for reserve cadre lists. When formulating its plan, the Public Security Department organized forces from all sides, mobilized all functional departments to participate in making the plan, and included the formulation of a long-term cadre training plan as part of its operational plan, so the work progressed smoothly. Lüda City formed a working group headed by the Deputy Mayor to uniformly lead the work of formulating cadre training plans; each functional bureau designated a bureau-level cadre to regularly manage the work of cadre training. Based on preliminary indicators of production development, they first determined the training plan for 1953, and then further extended it to long-term plans, thus solving the difficulty of not being able to propose training indicators due to the undetermined production development indicators. The Northeast Agriculture Department, the Trade Department, the Finance Department, and units in Liaodong and Jilin provinces and cities have done a relatively poor job in this area. Although they have organized a certain amount of manpower to prepare for the work, the work has progressed slowly. The leadership of Benxi City has also failed to give due attention to this issue, and only assigned two cadres from the cadre section to make the plan, which resulted in very poor progress.

In light of the above situation, the Personnel Department of the Northeast People's Government recently issued a notice, which, in addition to requiring departments that have not yet started formulating plans to earnestly implement the instructions of the Northeast People's Government and take active action, also made specific instructions on the issues that need attention in the current work of formulating plans. The Organization Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee also convened relevant departments and established a regular meeting system to study and promote this work.

In other news: According to the instructions of the State Council of the Central People's Government on consolidating and developing secondary technical education and the educational development plan of Tianjin, the Tianjin Education Bureau, in cooperation with the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, conducted a key survey and study of the technical learning of workers in factories and enterprises in the city, and decided to first pilot three types of formal workers' technical evening schools. The first type is workers' technical evening schools established in large factories with a certain foundation. Those that have been established include Tianjin Steel Plant, Waterworks Company, No. 2 Electrical Factory, Tianjin Knitting Factory, Tianjin Automobile Assembly Plant, No. 3 and No. 4 Power Plants of the Electric Power Bureau, etc. The second type is workers' technical evening schools jointly formed by industrial systems as units. Those that have been established include three evening schools in the electrical industry, mechanical industry, and financial and economic systems. The third type is short-term technical schools that draw apprentices away from production to learn technology. Those that have been established include the staff technical school and technical worker school of the Municipal Industrial Bureau and Tianjin United Machinery Factory.

The above total twelve workers' technical evening schools, with more than 2,500 workers participating in the study. These schools all have fixed administrative leadership bodies. The administrative aspects of the factories and relevant departments attach great importance to them. The administrative leadership of Tianjin Steel Plant has always attached importance to workers' technical learning. This year, it further expanded the staff training section of the administrative aspect into a technical education section, and the head of the section serves as the principal of the evening school. The Mechanical Evening School is composed of a school affairs committee jointly formed by the Education Bureau, the Joint Committee of the Hardware, Chemical, and Electrical Workers' Union, and the administrative aspects of relevant factories, which is responsible for the formulation of the entire school's work plan, the appointment of teachers, and other regular work.

Because the leadership of each school is relatively strong, the work can be carried out in a planned and regular manner. The students of each school are extremely enthusiastic about learning, and there is no phenomenon of unexcused absence. The students of Tianjin Steel Plant have also organized mutual assistance study groups to study together and help each other.

    为大规模经济建设培养人才
    东北各单位制订长期培养干部计划
    天津市成立十二所工人技术业余学校
    为了培养大规模经济建设所需要的人才，东北人民政府直属各部门及各省、市，正积极制订长期培养和训练干部的计划。目前工作进行得比较快、比较好的，是东北工业部、公安部、旅大市、辽西省等。东北工业部已经搜集了有关培养和训练干部计划的基本资料，现正在研究各项专门问题，着手定出计划轮廓。在研究需要增加多少干部的问题时，该部首先研究了生产和基本建设所需要技术干部的人数，并为了所属各局便于研究自己的任务，统一规定了五种指标。即：为国家和地方工业培养干部的指标，干部长期学习指标，短期轮训指标，提拔干部指标和后备干部名单指标等。公安部在制订计划时，组织了各方面力量，发动各业务部门大家动手做计划，把制订长期培养、训练干部的计划，列为业务计划的一部分，所以工作进行得很顺利。旅大市以副市长为首组成了工作组，统一领导制订培养干部计划工作；各业务局指定一位局长级干部经常掌握培养训练干部的工作。他们根据生产发展的初步指标，首先确定了一九五三年的培养训练计划，再进一步推及长期的计划，这样就解决了因生产发展指标未确定而提不出培养训练干部指标的困难。对这一工作作得比较差的有东北农业部、贸易部、财政部及辽东、吉林等省、市单位，他们虽然组织了一定的力量做准备工作，但工作进行的较慢；本溪市的领导方面对这问题也未予以应有的重视，仅派干部科两个干部做计划，以致工作开展得很差。
    根据上述情况，东北人民政府人事部于最近发出通知，除了要求尚未开始制订计划的部门应切实贯彻东北人民政府的指示积极行动外，并对当前制订计划工作中需要注意的问题做了具体指示。中共中央东北局组织部，亦召集有关部门，建立了定期会议制度，研究与推动这项工作。
    又讯：天津市教育局根据中央人民政府政务院关于整顿和发展中等技术教育的指示及该市教育发展计划，协同市总工会对市内工厂企业的工人技术学习情况，做了重点的调查和研究，决定先行试办三种类型的正式工人技术业余学校。第一类是在有一定基础的大工厂开办工人技术业余学校。现已成立者有天津钢厂、自来水公司、电工二厂、天津针织厂、天津汽车制配厂、电业局第三、第四发电厂等。第二类是以产业系统为单位联合组成的工人技术业余学校。现已成立者有电气工业、机械工业及财政经济三个系统的业余学校三所。第三类是抽调徒工脱离生产学习技术的短期技术学校，已成立的有市工业局和天津联合机器厂的职工技术学校与技工学校。
    以上共计十二所工人技术业余学校，参加学习的工人共二千五百余人。这些学校，都有固定的行政领导机构。工厂行政方面和有关部门都很重视。天津钢厂行政领导方面，对工人技术学习一直是重视的，今年更扩大了行政方面的员工训练股为技术教育科，由该科科长担任业余学校的校长。机械业余学校则由教育局、五金化学电业工会联合委员会及有关工厂的行政方面等联合组成的校务委员会，负责整个学校工作计划的制订、教师的聘任及其他经常工作。
    由于各校的领导都较强，工作都能有计划地正规地进行。各校学员学习情绪极高，没有无故缺席的现象。天津钢厂的学员们还组织了互助学习小组，共同研究，互助学习。
