People from all walks of life in Wanxian City, Sichuan Province, held a gathering on the 7th to commemorate the internationalist fighter, Soviet friend Kulichenko, who gloriously sacrificed himself in the War of Resistance Against Japan. More than 600 people from the Wanxian Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the Wanxian Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Wanxian Municipal People's Government and other organs and groups went to the Kulichenko Martyrs' Cemetery in the northern suburbs of the city to sweep the tomb and offer wreaths.

When flying over Wanxian along the Yangtze River, it could no longer fly and landed in the heart of the Yangtze River. Martyr Kulichenko drowned and sacrificed himself due to excessive fatigue.

    四川万县各界人民集会
    追悼苏联空军烈士
    【新华社成都十日电】四川省万县市各界人民七日集会追悼在抗日战争中光荣牺牲的国际主义战士——苏联友人库里申科烈士。万县中苏友好协会、中国共产党万县市委员会、万县市人民政府等机关团体六百余人，前往该市北郊库里申科烈士墓扫祭，并献花圈。
    库里申科烈士是苏联人民援助我抗击日寇的苏联空军志愿队的一个大队长。一九三九年八月十四日，他率领的大队在武汉上空和日机作战，曾击落敌机六架。最后，他所驾驶的领航机受了伤，沿长江飞到万县上空时，不能再飞，降落在长江江心。库里申科烈士因疲劳过度，沉江牺牲。
