    Is it permissible to collect land rent for state-owned land leased to farmers for cultivation?
    Question: Is it permissible to collect land rent when state-owned land is leased to farmers for cultivation or when local governments organize mass producers?
    Answer: After the land reform, for state-owned land legally retained, land rent should, in principle, be collected when it is leased to farmers for cultivation, in addition to the agricultural tax paid according to law. However, the following circumstances should be treated differently: (1) If the local government employs the masses for production and the land is still managed by the government, it should be regarded as the same as a local state-owned farm, and land rent should be waived. (2) If the local government temporarily allocates the land to local poor farmers for cultivation, land rent can be waived due to the temporary nature of the allocation.
    Anyone using state-owned land in urban suburbs for cultivation shall be exempt from land rent in accordance with Article 12 of the Regulations on Land Reform in Urban Suburbs, except for the agricultural tax paid to the state according to law.
    For state-owned land that is subject to rent collection, the standard of the rent amount should be appropriately stipulated, generally based on the principle of being lower than the rent amount of the local equivalent land.
    Question: To which level of finance should the rental income from state-owned land be allocated?
    Answer: The rental income from state-owned land shall be based on the principle of "who manages, who collects." According to Article 15 of the Land Reform Law, the land allocated for farms, before the farms are established and leased to farmers for cultivation, the land rent collected should be included in the county-level fiscal revenue if it is within the scope of a county; if it is within the scope of several counties, it should be included in the provincial-level fiscal revenue. The income from the mobile fields retained but not completely distributed during the land reform should be included in the county-level finance. The income from sandy fields and lake fields belongs to the county-level finance. The rental income from unused or affiliated land of railways, etc., shall be summarized and submitted to the Central Ministry of Finance by the competent departments; if there is no competent department and it is temporarily managed by the county or prefecture, it shall be regarded as the fiscal revenue of the county or province. The above land shall not be distributed or sold, and the state may take it back at any time if needed.

    国有土地租给农民耕种是否可收地租？
    问：国有土地出租给农民耕种或由地方政府组织群众生产者，是否可收地租？
    答：在土地改革后，依法保留的国有土地，在出租给农民耕种时，除依法缴纳农业税外，原则上应收地租。如遇下列情事，可以分别不同情况对待：（一）地方政府雇用群众生产、土地仍由政府管理的，应看作和地方国营农场一样，免收地租。（二）地方政府将土地暂时拨给当地贫苦农民耕种，因系临时性质，可以免收地租。
    凡使用城市郊区国有土地从事耕种的，依照城市郊区土地改革条例第十二条的规定，除依法向国家缴纳农业税外，一律免交地租。
    对收租的国有土地，应适当规定租额的标准，一般应以低于当地同等土地的租额为原则。
    问：国有土地的出租收入，应划归何级财政？
    答：国有土地的出租收入，以谁管谁收为原则。按照土地改革法第十五条规定划作农场的土地，在农场未举办以前出租给农民耕种的，其所收地租在一县范围内的，应归县级财政收入；在数县范围内的，应归省级财政收入。土地改革中留用而没有分完的机动田，其收入应归县级财政。沙田、湖田收入归县级财政。铁路等未用或附属土地的出租收入，由各主管部门汇总上缴中央财政部；无主管部门而暂由县或专署代管的，即作为县或省的财政收入。以上土地不得分配或出卖，如国家需要时可以随时收回。
