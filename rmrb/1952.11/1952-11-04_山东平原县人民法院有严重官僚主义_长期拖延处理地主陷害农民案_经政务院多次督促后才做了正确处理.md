    The People's Court of Pingyuan County, Shandong Province, failed to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, lost its position, and demonstrated a severely irresponsible bureaucratic style and a strong subjective and dogmatic old judicial style in handling the case of the reactionary landlord class of Zhangmazi Village framing farmer Han Sheng and usurping village political power. After the Central People's Government Government Administration Council repeatedly instructed the Shandong Provincial People's Government to seriously handle this case, the Pingyuan County People's Court has arrested and brought to justice the reactionary landlord Zhang Changzhi and the bad elements Wang Ming, Zhang Peixun, and Zhang Zhenshan; appropriate compensation has also been made to Han Sheng for the losses he suffered due to being wrongly struggled against and repeatedly appealing. In order to educate cadres to learn from this incident and overcome the bureaucracy and old judicial style that disregards the interests of the people, the Shandong Provincial People's Government convened a meeting on September 19th of personnel involved in handling the Han Sheng incident and the heads of secretariats and secretaries of various municipal governments, commissioner's offices, and provincial departments. The Provincial People's Supervision Committee has also issued a "Decision on the Punishment of Responsible Persons for Negligence in the Han Sheng Incident."
    Han Sheng is of middle peasant origin, lives in Zhangmazi Village, Pingyuan County, and is 72 years old this year. In his youth, he worked as a farmer and weaver, later pulled rickshaws and did odd jobs, and at one time participated in the work of our local troops. He was later sent back to his hometown due to old age, but still maintained contact with our troops, and participated several times in sabotaging railways during the Anti-Japanese War, secretly receiving our passing troops. After the troops moved south, contact was severed. From 1937 to 1941, he was elected by the villagers to serve as a puppet Bao chief to deal with the Japanese invaders. Investigations have proved that he did not oppress the masses during his tenure as a puppet Bao chief. On the contrary, he often resisted paying taxes to the enemy and puppets, constantly fought against the landlords in the village, litigated with the puppet township chief, and took care of the difficulties of some poor people. Generally speaking, the burden on the general masses within the three Jia he managed was lighter than the burden on the landlords and rich peasants in the village. Therefore, he was dissatisfied with the landlords and rich peasants and was framed and imprisoned twice, and was forced to sell 14 mu of land to repay the puppet funds. His third son, Han Shitian, was also captured and killed by the enemy and puppets. The eldest son committed suicide because the bandits and puppets were pursuing grain payments and were constantly worried about his father. Han Sheng spent some money from the masses in dealing with the lower-level elements of the Japanese invaders, puppet troops, and local reactionary party groups, but did not embezzle it for his own benefit. After the village was liberated in 1946, he was elected as the chairman of the peasant association. During the land redemption, due to his low class consciousness, he was invited to dinner by the landlords twice and did not seriously lead the peasants to recover the 3,000 jin of grain fined from the landlords. However, by the time of the land reform in the village in 1947, his consciousness had improved, and he resolutely led the peasants to overthrow the landlords, and his work was very active. From 1947 to the present, he has also reported more than 600 mu of black land in the village three times, which has dissatisfied some backward masses and cadres in the village. The landlords are always looking for opportunities to frame him.
    During the land reform review in 1947, the landlord Zhang Changzhi and others in the village colluded with bad elements Zhang Xizeng, Zhang Xide, Zhang Peixun, Zhang Zhenshan, and others, and obtained the consent of Lin Junshan, the county and district resident work cadre at the time, to detain Han Sheng as a struggle target, and incited Han Sheng's clan grandson Han Hongxi and niece-in-law Jia Zhenyu to accuse Han Sheng of being a "Qin Hui." When Han Hongxi and Jia Zhenyu refused to do so, the landlord and bad elements beat Han Hongxi severely and detained him. Later, they instigated Zhu Wenting to falsely accuse Han Sheng, saying that Zhu Wenting was captured by the bandit army, resulting in the family's bankruptcy, which was Han Sheng's frame-up. At the same time, they seized on the fact that Han Sheng had reported black land to the Anti-Japanese government and propagated, "If Han Sheng is not overthrown, the masses will have no way to live," in order to create hatred among the masses towards Han Sheng. Among the poor and lower-middle peasants, they seized on the excuse that Han Sheng had eaten the landlords' food, saying that Han Sheng was a "Qin Hui," instigating the poor and lower-middle peasants to oppose the already awakened Han Sheng. The work team in the village at that time not only failed to expose and attack the landlords' counterattack, but threatened the masses, saying, "Whoever does not participate has a problem." Subsequently, under the control of the landlord's lackeys Zhang Peixun, Zhang Xizeng, Zhang Zhenshan, Zhang Xishun, and others, with the approval of Lin Junshan, a cadre of the land reform work team, a mass meeting to struggle against Han Sheng was convened. Zhang Xide and Zhang Zhenshan, instigated by the landlords, took the lead in severely beating Han Sheng, who died and was resuscitated several times. Han Sheng was seriously injured and took eight months to recover. In addition, a portion of Han Sheng's and his three sons' (who had already lived separately) livestock, grain, furniture, trees, and clothing were confiscated. Later, during the rectification period, not only was there no correction, but Zhang Peixun and others continued to dig up a large elm tree belonging to Han Sheng's daughter-in-law (widow), and Zhang Peixun and others destroyed two of the houses belonging to Han Sheng's eldest and third sons. Since then, the reactionary forces in the village have become arrogant, and a group of bad elements controlled or influenced by the landlords have seized village political power. Zhang Xizeng became the village chief, Zhang Peixun and Zhu Wenting became the chairman of the peasant association, and Zhang Zhenshan and others became members of the peasant association. Zhang Peixun even infiltrated the Communist Party and usurped the position of village branch secretary. Although the district made a cleanup, it was not thorough, and the landlords and bad elements still secretly ruled the entire village. Zhang Peixun convened a mass meeting to openly discuss collectively concealing land; stole the village government's seal and introduced the bad element Zhang Zhenshan to study in the county cadre training class; introduced his clan's Kuomintang member Zhang Xixin as a primary school teacher; and shielded his clan's reactionary Jiugongdao cult leader Zhang Xiguang. Under the control of Zhang Peixun and others, the landlords Zhang Changzhi and Zhang Changrong were classified as middle peasants. The reactionary landlords demanded the return of houses and land from the peasants, and openly insulted the peasants. The landlord Zhang Changzhi even openly instructed Zhang Peixun: "When you become a cadre, you must promote more people from our courtyard (referring to landlords and rich peasants of the same clan), and you can't just choose people from other surnames to be cadres." Even this year, they are still carrying out small group activities. Whenever county and district cadres hold meetings in the village, they hold separate small meetings, with secret signals when gathering and using jargon when speaking. During the summer grain requisition this year, all the village cadres reported difficulties for the landlord Zhang Changrong, intending to seek reduction and exemption. After investigation, Zhang Changrong had no conditions for reduction or exemption. These facts fully demonstrate that the struggle against Han Sheng is not a simple sectarian struggle, but a class struggle in which the landlords used feudal clan sentiment, provoked relations among the masses, attacked peasant activists, and attempted to usurp village political power.
    In April 1951, Han Sheng went to the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government to appeal. The Government Administration Council immediately forwarded this appeal to the Pingyuan County People's Government for handling. The county People's Government approved the handling by the County People's Supervision Committee, and first submitted it to the First District Government for investigation. During this period, Ren Shanjun, director of the County People's Supervision Committee, spoke with Han Sheng once, explaining to him that the government would definitely handle it seriously after the investigation. However, it was not until June, when the Government Administration Council urged a report on the handling situation, that Ren Shanjun discovered that the First District Government had only handed over the original letter from the Government Administration Council to Liu Guiying, director of the District Women's Federation, for investigation, and she had forgotten about it. After Ren Shanjun requested instructions from Zhao Yi, secretary of the County Party Committee, he and Han Guangming, director of the County Government's Civil Affairs Section, conducted a week-long investigation in Zhangmazi Village, clarified the basic facts of the case, and believed that Han Sheng was indeed wrongly struggled against. However, they mistakenly believed that it was only a sectarian struggle. They reported to Zhao Yi twice in succession, but Zhao Yi did not instruct how to handle it. Later, Zhao Yi was transferred to work in the province, and Ren Shanjun repeatedly asked County Chief Wang Lixiang how to handle it. Wang Lixiang did not seriously study the instructions from higher authorities, nor did he understand the nature of the case, and arbitrarily believed that this was just a general incident of infringing on the interests of middle peasants during the land reform period, which could not be compensated, and told Ren Shanjun to wait and see. At the same time, he asked Ren Shanjun to write out the investigation situation of the case and the opinion of compensating for losses after the end of the land reform, and reported it to the Government Administration Council last October. Since then, the county has not inquired about the case. During this period, Han Sheng went to the county five times to urge the handling, but to no avail. Han Sheng again appealed to the Government Administration Council at the end of last October.
    In November, the Government Administration Council sent a letter to the Shandong Provincial People's Government urging the handling of the case. The General Office of the Provincial People's Government immediately sent a letter to the Pingyuan County People's Government urging prompt handling and reporting. The county approved the handling by the County People's Court. However, Liu Qingyun, deputy president of the People's Court, emphasized that the case involved cadre issues, and it was inconvenient for the court to handle it, and repeatedly shirked responsibility. Although he accepted it later, he still did not handle it. Han Sheng had no way, and went to the Government Administration Council for the third time last December to appeal. The Government Administration Council again sent a letter urging the Shandong Provincial People's Government to handle and report. The General Office of the Provincial Government also sent a letter to Pingyuan County urging prompt handling. However, the County People's Court still did not pay attention to the case and handed it over to worker Wang Guanmin for trial. Wang Guanmin did not conduct any investigation or research, and based solely on hearsay, subjectively and arbitrarily believed that Han Sheng was a "pen pusher" and a "bad person." It was not until January of this year that he first summoned Han Sheng. Soon after, he summoned the original and defendant twice. However, Wang Guanmin only individually questioned the witnesses controlled by the defendant, and tried his best to support the defendant Zhang Peixun and others, suppressing Han Sheng's speech. Later, Han Sheng went to the court three more times to urge the handling, but Wang Guanmin did not let him enter the room, always saying "no time" and walking away; or simply hiding. On April 25th, Han Sheng went to the court for the seventh time, and Wang Guanmin still wanted to push him away, but he resolutely refused to leave. Wang Guanmin was forced to write a summons, pushing it to the court hearing on May 8th. When that day came, he only asked casually and told Han Sheng to go home and wait for the verdict. Later, Wang Guanmin drafted a judgment based on his personal impression and the testimony of the defendant and witnesses, reversing right and wrong, distorting facts, and trying his best to exonerate the defendant. For example, the so-called plaintiff "embezzled during his tenure," "aroused the anger of the masses"; described the more than ten mu of land that Han Sheng should have redeemed as "inconsistent with the land redemption policy, and the plaintiff did not abide by the law"; and described Han Sheng's active behavior of removing obstacles and reporting black land as "joint efforts of resident cadres and activists." Liu Qingyun, the deputy president who actually led the court's work at the time, neither studied the instructions from higher authorities, nor conducted on-the-spot investigations, nor studied the investigation materials of the County People's Supervision Committee and the statements of the parties concerned, and easily agreed to this erroneous judgment based solely on Wang Guanmin's report; and changed "the struggle against Han Sheng was caused by the one-sidedness of the resident cadres in implementing the policy" in the original judgment to "caused by the one-sidedness of the entire policy implementation," aggravating the error of the original judgment. Before this, the County Adjudication Committee (Liu Qingyun was also a member) had made a resolution on this case, which mentioned "compensating Han Sheng for a portion of the loss; removing the label of being struggled against and restoring his good influence." In the judgment drafted by Wang Guanmin and revised by Liu Qingyun, the second half of the sentence was deleted. The first half of the sentence did not specify who should be responsible for the compensation and when the compensation should be made, and actually wanted to perfunctorily deal with it.
    On May 26th, after Wang Guanmin announced this erroneous judgment to Han Sheng, Han Sheng looked like he was insane and immediately appealed to the Dezhou Branch. Xu Yaoting, an old staff member of the court, used the excuse that there were too many backlog cases and could not be handled quickly, and advised Han Sheng: "A year of litigation, ten years of hatred." Meaning to persuade him to go home. On June 28th, Han Sheng went to the branch court to urge the handling, and Wu Yutong, a cadre of the court, mobilized him to go home and wait for some time. On July 9th, he went to the branch court for the third time. Yang Gongtian, the deputy president of the court, talked with him, believing that the case was complicated and worthy of attention, but still said that there were many cases and could not be resolved quickly. Seeing that the problem could not be solved, Han Sheng went to the Government Administration Council for the fourth time to appeal.
    During Han Sheng's appeal to the Dezhou Branch, the Shandong Provincial People's Government received the judgment on Han Sheng's case sent by Pingyuan County and sent it to the Provincial People's Court for review. The Provincial Court pointed out that the phrase "compensate the plaintiff for the loss" at the end of the second item of the judgment should determine who is responsible for the compensation. The General Office of the Provincial Government did not seriously study it, and sent a letter to the Pingyuan County Court basically agreeing to the judgment, only repeating the opinion of the Provincial Court once, asking the court to correct and implement it. On July 16th, the Shandong Provincial People's Government received the instructions from the Government Administration Council: "Han Sheng refused to accept the county judgment and came to appeal again, saying that the County People's Court did not allow him to speak during the judgment, and he appealed to the Dezhou Branch, but the court was busy with the Three-Anti Campaign and had no time to deal with it," and pointed out: "The Pingyuan County People's Government and the People's Court have different investigations twice. Whether there is any error should be re-investigated." This aroused the further attention of the General Office of the Shandong Provincial Government to the case. After analysis, it pointed out the focus of the reinvestigation and sent a letter to the Dezhou Prefecture on July 22nd, and sent cadre Zheng Chifu to supervise the handling. The Dezhou Branch also sent Wang Yushan, Pingyuan County sent Ren Shanjun, director of the Supervision Committee, Kuang Yuxin of the Public Security Bureau, and several district and township cadres to form an investigation team to conduct an investigation in Zhangmazi Village. Finally, it was affirmed that wrongly struggling against Han Sheng was indeed a class struggle in which the landlords launched a counterattack against the peasants. Therefore, with the approval of the Pingyuan County and with the approval of the higher authorities, the original judgment was revoked and a new judgment was made to arrest the unlawful landlord Zhang Changzhi; compensate Han Sheng for 8.7 mu of land, 3 trees, and 16 purlins from the existing land reform results in the village; and publicly accuse bad elements such as Zhang Xizeng, Zhang Zhenshan, and Zhang Xide in the village. The Pingyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China also decided to remove Zhang Peixun from the position of village branch secretary and expel him from the Party. On August 6th, Pingyuan County sent personnel to Zhangmazi Village to convene a mass sentencing meeting, exposing the activities of the unlawful landlord Zhang Changzhi and commending Han Sheng, who insisted on the struggle. Afterwards, the Shandong Provincial People's Government, according to the instructions of the Government Administration Council, sent personnel to Pingyuan County for the second time to further understand the situation, distinguish the responsibilities of the relevant cadres, and with the decision of the prefecture, arrested the bad elements Zhang Peixun, Zhang Zhenshan, and others. The travel expenses incurred by Han Sheng in appealing against the reactionary landlords and bad elements were also decided to be compensated with county relief grain. Finally, the Shandong Provincial People's Government also specially convened a meeting of the personnel involved in handling the Han Sheng incident and the heads of secretariats of various prefectures and municipal governments, summarizing the lessons of this incident and issuing the "Instructions on Strengthening the Handling of People's Letters and Visits, and Seriously Handling People's Accusation Incidents." The Shandong Provincial People's Supervision Committee also decided to give the negligent personnel Liu Qingyun, deputy president of the Pingyuan County People's Court, and worker Wang Guanmin the punishment of removal from office, and Wang Lixiang, the former county head of the Pingyuan County People's Government, and Yang Gongtian, the deputy president of the Dezhou Branch of the Shandong Provincial People's Court, the punishment of warning, according to the severity of the circumstances. Du Yuting, the president of the Pingyuan County People's Court, was given a demerit for his dereliction of duty, because he had always been irresponsible in his work since taking office and did not know about the Han Sheng case, but never conducted any inspection and research. After the correct handling of this case, Han Sheng was very moved and went to the Government Administration Council to express his gratitude.

    山东平原县人民法院有严重官僚主义
    长期拖延处理地主陷害农民案
    经政务院多次督促后才做了正确处理
    山东省平原县人民法院在处理张麻子村反动地主阶级陷害农民韩昇、篡夺村政权的案件中敌我不分，丧失立场，并表现了严重不负责任的官僚主义作风和浓厚的主观臆断的旧司法作风。这一案件经中央人民政府政务院再三指示山东省人民政府严肃处理后，平原县人民法院已将反动地主张长治和坏分子王明、张培训、张振山逮捕法办；对韩昇因被错斗和往返控告所受的损失也作了适当的补偿。山东省人民政府为了教育干部接受这一事件的教训，克服漠视人民群众的利益的官僚主义和旧司法作风，于九月十九日召开了处理韩昇事件有关人员及省属各市府、各专员公署和省直属机关各部门秘书处长、秘书主任的会议，省人民监察委员会并已作出了“关于韩昇事件有关失职人员的处分决定”。
    韩昇是中农成份，家住平原县张麻子村，现年七十二岁。他在青年时以种地织布为业，以后又拉过洋车，扛过活，并曾一度参加我地方部队工作。后因年老被遣回乡，但仍与我部队有联系，曾数次参加抗日时期的破坏铁路活动，秘密招待我过往部队。后部队向南转移，即断绝了联系。一九三七年到一九四一年，他曾被村民选举担任应付日寇的伪保长。经调查证明，他在任伪保长的期间并未欺压过群众，相反的还经常抗缴敌伪税款，不断与本村地主作斗争，与伪乡长等打官司，照顾过部分贫苦群众的困难。一般说来，在他所管辖的三甲内，一般群众的负担轻于该村地主富农的负担。因此他为地主富农所不满，前后被陷坐牢两次，并被迫出卖土地十四亩，用以缴还伪款，他的第三个儿子韩世田也被敌伪捕杀了。长子则因匪伪追逼粮款和经常为父亲担心而自杀。在应付日寇、伪军及地方反动党团的下层分子中，韩昇花了群众一些钱，但未贪污自肥。一九四六年该村解放后，他当选为农会主任。在土地回赎时，由于他的阶级觉悟不高，曾被地主请去吃饭两次，没有认真领导农民追讨地主被罚的三千斤粮。但在一九四七年该村土地改革时，他的觉悟已有提高，他坚决领导农民斗倒了地主，工作很积极。一九四七年到现在，他还前后三次报出该村黑地六百多亩，为村中部分落后群众和干部所不满。地主更随时想找机会陷害他。
    一九四七年土地改革复查时，该村地主张长治等与坏分子张希曾、张希德、张培训、张振山等勾结起来，取得当时县、区驻村工作干部蔺俊三的同意，把韩昇当做斗争对象扣押起来，鼓动韩昇的族孙韩洪禧和侄媳贾振玉控诉韩昇是“秦桧”。韩洪禧和贾振玉不干，地主坏分子把韩洪禧毒打了一顿，还把他扣押起来；以后又挑拨朱文廷诬赖韩昇，说朱文廷被匪军捕去，以至倾家荡产，是韩昇陷害的。同时抓住韩昇曾向抗日政府呈报黑地的事实，宣传“如果斗不倒韩昇，群众就没法过”，借以制造群众对韩昇的仇恨。在贫雇农中间更抓住韩昇曾经吃地主的饭为藉口，说韩昇是“秦桧”，挑拨贫雇农反对已经觉悟了的韩昇。当时在该村的工作队不但没有揭发和打击地主们的这种反攻，反而威胁群众说：“谁不参加谁有问题。”其后即在地主腿子张培训、张希曾、张振山、张希顺等把持下，经土地改革工作队干部蔺俊三批准，召开了斗争韩昇的群众大会。张希德、张振山在地主们鼓动下带头毒打韩昇，死而复苏数次。韩昇被打得重伤，八个月才痊愈。此外，还没收了韩昇和他已经分居的三个儿子的一部分牲畜、粮食、家具、树木、衣物等。以后在纠偏时期，不仅没有纠正，还继续刨了韩昇三儿媳（寡妇）的大榆树一棵，张培训等又将韩昇大儿子和三儿子的房屋毁了两幢。自此该村反动势力气焰高涨，一批受地主操纵或影响的不良分子掌握了村政权。张希曾当了村长，张培训、朱文廷当了农会主任，张振山等当了农会委员。张培训还混进了共产党，窃取了村支部书记的职位。以后虽经区作了一番清洗，但不彻底，地主坏分子仍然暗暗地统治着全村。张培训曾召开群众会议，公开商讨集体匿报土地；盗用村公所图章，介绍坏分子张振山到县干部训练班学习；介绍其本族国民党分子张希信当小学教师；包庇其本族反动九宫道小道首张希广。在张培训等把持下，把地主张长治、张长荣划为中农。反动地主则向农民索还房地，并公开辱骂农民。地主张长治更公开训示张培训：“你当了干部，就得把咱院里的人（指本族地主富农）多提上几个去，不能净选别姓的人当干部。”直到今年，他们仍在进行小团体活动。每逢县、区干部在村开会以后，他们就另开小会，集合时有暗号，说话时用黑话。今年夏征时，全体村干部还为地主张长荣报困难，意在争取减免。后经调查，张长荣并无减免条件。这些事实充分说明，斗争韩昇绝不是单纯的宗派斗争，而是地主利用封建宗派感情，挑拨群众关系，打击农民积极分子，意图篡夺村政权的阶级斗争。
    一九五一年四月，韩昇到中央人民政府政务院控诉。政务院立即将这一控诉转交平原县人民政府处理。该县人民政府批交县人民监察委员会办理，并先交一区区政府进行调查。其间县人民监察委员会主任任善俊曾和韩昇谈话一次，向他说明政府调查后一定会严肃处理。但直到六月间政务院催报处理情况时，任善俊才发现一区区政府只将政务院的原函交区妇联主任刘桂英调查，而她竟忘了这一件事。任善俊向县委书记赵毅请示后，同县府民政科长韩光明到张麻子村作了一周的调查，弄清了基本案情，认为韩昇确是被错斗的。但他们却错误地以为只是宗派斗争。他们向赵毅先后汇报两次，赵毅也没有指示如何处理。以后赵毅调省工作，任善俊又几次请示县长王力翔应如何处理。王力翔没有认真研究上级的指示，也不了解案情的性质，就武断地认为这只是土地改革时期一般性的侵犯中农利益事件，无法赔偿，要任善俊等等再说。同时让任善俊把该案的调查情况和等结束土地改革时再补偿损失的意见都写出来，于去年十月上报到政务院。从此该县便没有过问这一案件。在这期间，韩昇曾五次去县催办，都得不到结果，韩昇复于去年十月底到政务院控告。
    政务院于十一月函示山东省人民政府催办该案，省人民政府办公厅当即函催平原县人民政府从速处理具报。该县批交县人民法院接办。但人民法院副院长刘庆云强调该案涉及干部问题，法院不便处理，再三推诿，以后虽然接受了，但仍未处理。韩昇没法，又于去年十二月第三次去政务院控告。政务院又再次函催山东省人民政府处理具报，省府办公厅也再次函催平原县迅速处理。但该县人民法院仍然不重视这一案件，把它交给工作员王冠民审理。而王冠民没有作过任何调查研究，仅凭传闻所得，便主观武断地认为韩昇是“刀笔”、“坏人”，直到今年一月才第一次传讯韩昇。不久又传讯了两次原被告。但王冠民仅个别讯问为被告所掌握的证人，且尽力支持被告张培训等，压制韩昇发言。以后韩昇又三次去法院催办，王冠民都没有让他进屋，总是推说“没空”，就走开了；或干脆躲着不见。四月二十五日，韩昇第七次去法院，王冠民仍然想把他推走，但他坚决不走。王冠民被迫写了一张传票，推到五月八日过堂。到了那天，又只草率问了一下，就叫韩昇回家听候判决。以后王冠民便根据个人的印象和被告及证人的口供拟订了一个判决，在主要情节上颠倒是非，歪曲事实，极力为被告开脱罪责。如所谓原告“在职时贪污”，“引起群众之怒火”；把韩昇应赎回的十多亩地说成“与赎地政策不符，系原告不遵守法令”；把韩昇排除障碍呈报黑地的积极行为，说成是“驻村干部和积极分子共同协力完成”。当时实际领导法院业务的副院长刘庆云，既未研究上级指示，也不作实地调查，也不研究县人民监察委员会的调查材料和当事人的口供，仅凭王冠民的汇报，就轻易地同意了这一错误判决；并把原判决中“斗争韩昇系驻村干部执行政策之片面性所致”，改为“系整个执行政策之片面性所致”，加重了原判的错误。在这以前，该县裁判委员会（刘庆云也是委员）曾对这一案件作了一个决议，其中提到“赔偿韩昇一部损失；摘掉被斗帽子，挽回不良影响。”在王冠民起草的、经刘庆云修改的判决书中，下半句被删掉了。上半句则未指明应由谁负责赔偿，什么时候赔偿，实际是想敷衍了事。
    五月二十六日王冠民将这一错误判决向韩昇宣布之后，韩昇状似疯癫，马上又上诉到德州分院。该院旧人员许耀亭以积案过多，不能迅速处理为辞，劝韩昇说：“一年官司十年仇”。意思是劝他回家。六月二十八日韩昇又去分院催办，该院干部吴玉同动员他回家再等些时候。七月九日他又第三次去分院，该院副院长杨公田和他谈话，认为案情复杂，值得重视，但仍表示案件很多，不能迅速解决。韩昇眼看问题无法解决，又第四次去政务院控告。
    在韩昇到德州分院上诉的期间，山东省人民政府接到平原县寄来的关于韩昇案的判决，即送请省人民法院审查。省法院指出判决第二项末尾“补偿原告之损失”应确定由谁负责补偿。省府办公厅未认真研究，便函复平原县法院，基本同意该判决，仅把省法院的意见重述了一遍，要该院修正执行。七月十六日山东省人民政府接到政务院的指示：“韩昇不服县判又来控诉，说县人民法院判决时不准他说话，上诉德州分院，因该院正搞三反没有功夫，不予处理”，并指出：“平原县人民政府与人民法院两次调查各不相同，有无错误，应再复查”。这才引起了山东省府办公厅对该案的进一步重视，作了分析，指出复查重点，于七月二十二日函示德州专署，并派干部郑痴夫前往督促处理。德州分院也派王玉山、平原县派监察委员会主任任善俊、公安局邝玉新及区、乡干部数人，共同组成调查小组，前往张麻子村作了调查，最后肯定错斗韩昇确是地主向农民反攻的阶级斗争。因此，由平原县决定、经上级机关批准后，撤销了原判决，重新判决逮捕不法地主张长治；由该村现存土地改革果实中补偿韩昇土地八亩七分、树三棵、檩条十六根；在该村当众指责张希曾、张振山、张希德等不良分子。中共平原县委会也决定撤销张培训的村支部书记职务，并开除其党籍。八月六日平原县又派员到张麻子村召开了群众宣判大会，揭发了不法地主张长治的活动，表扬了坚持斗争的韩昇。其后山东省人民政府又根据政务院的指示，第二次派员到平原县作了进一步的了解，分清了有关干部的责任，并经专署决定，逮捕了坏分子张培训、张振山等。韩昇因控诉反动地主和坏分子往返所花路费，也决定用县救济粮给以补偿。最后山东省人民政府还专门召开了处理韩昇事件的有关人员及各专署、市府秘书主任的会议，总结了这一事件的教训，并发布了“关于加强处理人民来信、接见人民工作和认真处理人民控告事件的指示”。山东省人民监察委员会也根据情节轻重，决定给予失职人员平原县人民法院副院长刘庆云、工作员王冠民以撤职处分，前平原县人民政府县长王力翔和山东省人民法院德州分院副院长杨公田以警告处分。平原县人民法院院长杜雨亭，因任职以来对工作一贯不负责任，对韩昇案件不是不知道，但从未进行检查研究，是一种失职行为，因此决定给予记过处分。这一案件正确处理以后，韩昇十分感动，并到政务院表示感谢。
