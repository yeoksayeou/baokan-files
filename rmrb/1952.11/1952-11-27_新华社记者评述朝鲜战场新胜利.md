Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, November 26th: This correspondent on the front lines comments on the new victory on the Korean battlefield: As autumn turns to winter, the Korean War has reached its most intense point since October of last year. In September and October of last year, Van Fleet launched the so-called "Autumn Offensive," concentrating more than nine divisions and launching two key offensives, first on the western front and then on the central front. The invading forces lost more than 55,000 men, only to advance six to eight kilometers in local areas of the front lines. One year later, Van Fleet launched his largest offensive yet – the offensive in the Kimhwa area. However, after more than a month of attacking, the invading forces suffered more than 20,000 casualties and were still stopped at their starting point, unable to advance. This indicates that a new change has taken place on the Korean battlefield.

If we analyze the recent situation on the Korean battlefield, we will have a clear understanding of this new change. Since mid-September of this year, the basic situation on the Korean battlefield has been as follows: On the one hand, the Korean and Chinese People's Armies have proactively launched a series of tactical counter-attacks, annihilating large numbers of enemy troops and capturing some of their positions. On the other hand, the enemy forces, from a position of being passively beaten, have barely managed to launch an offensive in the Kimhwa area. It is this offensive that has caused the American invaders to suffer their greatest defeat since the disastrous "Autumn Offensive" last year. This fully demonstrates that the American invaders are in an increasingly weak and deteriorating predicament.

Before Van Fleet launched this offensive, the Korean and Chinese People's Armies had withstood thousands of combat tests in positional defense warfare, establishing a completely solid front line near the 38th parallel, blocking and annihilating invading enemy forces. They also have the strength to reach out at any time and heavily strike the enemy entrenched in fortifications. Since the Korean and Chinese People's Armies began conducting tactical counter-attacks in mid-September of this year, our forces have annihilated nearly 100,000 enemy troops, including more than 35,000 American soldiers. Our ground forces alone have shot down or damaged more than 1,300 enemy aircraft.

The tactical counter-attacks carried out by the Korean and Chinese People's Armies aim to annihilate the enemy's manpower, but they do not abandon the capture of enemy positions under favorable conditions, and they consolidate the positions they have occupied. Since mid-September of this year, our forces have captured a total of 78 enemy positions. These enemy positions are guarded by forces ranging from a squad to a battalion, and some of the positions have been fortified over a long period of time. However, under the coordinated attack of our infantry, artillery, and tanks, these positions, large and small, were captured in a matter of minutes or half an hour. Now our forces have consolidated more than ten of the 78 enemy positions we have captured. Conversely, although the enemy has launched frequent attacks on our positions during this period, they have not been able to occupy a single position defended by our squad, let alone platoon or company positions.

When Van Fleet launched his offensive towards the Kimhwa area, he boasted that he would occupy the land he needed to occupy. Now people know that the bubble he blew has burst. But the problem does not lie there. What has made him recently silent is that the disastrous defeat of the Kimhwa area offensive has brought the most shameful page in military history to the American army.

The two hill positions near Shangganling, north of Kimhwa, were only defended by two companies of our forces, and the total area of these positions was only three square kilometers. However, in order to occupy these two targets, Van Fleet mobilized more than two divisions, including the US 7th Division and the puppet 2nd Division, as well as more than a hundred tanks. He even committed the US 8th Army's artillery general reserve, which is not easily used, to the battle. When attacking one of our hill positions, they sent in four or five battalions of "large armies" at a time, and if one attack failed, they attacked again, launching continuous attacks up to twenty or thirty times. The artillery fire used by the enemy to support its infantry attacks also reached an unprecedented level of intensity since the Korean War, with an average of more than 24,000 shells falling on this short section of the front line every day, and nearly 300,000 shells in the maximum 24 hour period. The enemy's daily sorties averaged 63, and one day even reached more than 250. The maximum number of heavy bombs dropped in a single day reached more than 500, almost lowering the hilltop by two meters, and the rocks on the mountain were blasted into powder more than a foot thick. The firepower used by the enemy has reached a shocking level rarely seen in the history of world warfare. Who could believe that in the face of such an offensive, they could still stand their ground and defend their positions! However, the invincible Korean and Chinese People's Armies once again withstood a severe test and created earth-shattering heroic feats. Relying on solid tunnel fortifications, they displayed a high degree of revolutionary heroism and, in close coordination with our powerful artillery and tank units, used flexible tactics to resist the enemy's attacks, killing large numbers of enemy troops and causing the invading forces to suffer even more disastrous defeats than in the past – paying a heavy price without being able to advance.

The day Van Fleet launched the Kimhwa area offensive was the day the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly opened in New York. He chose this "good day" to launch the largest offensive on the Korean battlefield in a year, originally intending to win back some face for the American invaders who had repeatedly failed, and to boost the morale of his followers and deceive them into becoming cannon fodder. However, after more than a month of fighting, the invading forces lost more than 20,000 men and consumed a large amount of equipment and supplies. This tells people that Van Fleet is doomed to lose. Listen to the confessions of their failure coming from the enemy camp:

"The American army's casualty rate has reached its highest point in a year."

"The Kimhwa campaign has now become a bottomless pit, swallowing more Allied military resources than any Chinese army's general offensive."

"The Chinese artillery has played an amazing role."

"The Chinese army's particularly fierce artillery fire and seemingly unlimited ammunition have repeatedly paralyzed the Allied infantry operations."

Van Fleet has nothing left to salvage his defeat. He himself is as anxious as an ant on a hot pot, and has gone to the front lines three times on October 18, 21, and November 5 to "inspect," and even Clark and Syngman Rhee rushed to "boost morale." But what's the use of that? Haven't their soldiers "attacked to within 50 yards of the summit at least ten times, without advancing in one go" and then retreated?

Replacing generals? The commander of the puppet 2nd Division has already been driven out of his command post. Committing reserves? The 8th Army's artillery general reserve has long been used, and the puppet 9th Division was pulled back up after less than a week of reorganization, and the US 25th Division has recently rushed up to replace the US 7th Division.... May I ask: How much more can Van Fleet bet, and how many more lives does he intend to throw into this "bottomless pit" of the Korean battlefield? What to do? Give up? Continue the attack? This is naturally up to Van Fleet himself to choose. However, please do not forget the advice that the Associated Press gave him as early as November 2: "It seems to be just expenditure and no income."

    新华社记者评述朝鲜战场新胜利
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十六日电】本社前线记者评述朝鲜战场的新胜利说：在秋冬之交的时候，朝鲜战争发展到了自去年十月以来最激烈的程度。去年九、十两月，范佛里特发动了所谓“秋季攻势”，集中九个多师的兵力，先后在西线和中线进行了两次重点进攻，进犯军损失了五万五千多人，才换得在战线的局部地段上前进了六至八公里。过了一年的今天，范佛里特又发动了一次最大的攻势——金化地区的攻势，可是侵略军攻了一个多月，伤亡了两万多人，结果仍被阻在它们进攻的出发地，不能前进一步。这表明朝鲜战场已经发生了新的变化。
    如果把最近的朝鲜战局作一番分析，人们就会对这一新的变化有着清楚的认识。从今年九月中旬以来，朝鲜战场的基本状况是这样的：一方面是朝中人民军队主动地发起了一系列的战术反击战，大量地歼灭了敌军，并且攻占了敌军的若干阵地；另方面则是敌军从被动挨打的架势勉强地发动了在金化地区的攻势。正是这个攻势，美国侵略者使自己遭到了自去年“秋季攻势”惨败以来最大的惨败。这充分地说明：美国侵略者已处在愈战愈弱，每况愈下的尴尬境地。
    在范佛里特发动这次攻势以前，朝中人民军队已在阵地防御作战中经受了千百次的战斗考验，使自己在三八线附近建立了一条完全稳固的阵线，阻击和消灭着进犯的敌军。并且有力量随时伸出拳头，去沉重地打击据守在工事里的敌人。仅从今年九月中旬朝中人民军队开始进行战术性的反击战以后到现在，我军已经歼灭敌军近十万人，其中美军三万五千余人；仅我地面部队即击落击伤敌机一千三百余架。
    朝中人民军队进行的战术反击，目的是在歼灭敌军的有生力量；但也不放弃在有利条件下攻占敌军的阵地，并且巩固已占领的阵地。自今年九月中旬以来，我军共攻占了敌军阵地七十八处。敌军的这些阵地，是由一个班到一个营的兵力据守着的，而且有些阵地的工事是经过了长期的构筑的。但是，在我军步兵、炮兵和坦克的协同攻击下，这些大大小小的阵地在几分钟或半小时之内就被攻占了。现在我军已经在攻占敌军的七十八处阵地中固守着十多处阵地。可是与此相反的，敌人在这个时期内虽曾向我军阵地进行了频繁的攻击，但是敌人却没有能够占领我军一个班守卫的阵地，更不用说要占领排和连的阵地了。
    范佛里特这次向金化地区发动攻势的时候，曾经夸下海口说要占领他所需要占领的土地。现在人们已经知道他吹的肥皂泡是破灭了。但是问题还不在这里，使他近来沉默寡言的，却是因为金化地区攻势的惨败给美国军队带来了战史上最可耻的一页。
    在金化以北上甘岭附近的两个山头阵地，不过是我军两个连兵力扼守的阵地，而且这个阵地的总面积仅有三平方公里。但是，范佛里特为了占领这两个目标，却动用了美七师、伪二师等两个多师兵力和百多辆坦克，而且还把不轻易使用的美军第八军炮兵总预备队也投入了战斗。他们在攻击我军一个山头阵地时一次就拥上来四、五个营的“大军”，一次进攻不成就再次进攻，以至连续地进攻到二、三十次。敌人用来配合其步兵进攻的炮火，也达到朝鲜战争以来空前未有的猛烈程度，倾泻到这短短一段战线上的炮弹，平均每天二万四千多发，最多的一昼夜竟达近三十万发。敌军每天出动的飞机平均是六十三架次，有一天竟达到二百五十多架次。投掷的重磅炸弹最多的一天达到五百多枚，几乎把山头削低了两公尺，山上的岩石被轰击成为一尺多厚的粉末。敌人使用的火力，已经达到世界战争史上少有的惊人的程度了。谁能相信在这种进攻面前，怎样还能站得住脚跟、守得住阵地！然而，无敌的朝中人民军队又一次经受了严重的考验，创造了惊天动地的英雄伟绩。他们依托着坚固的坑道工事，发扬了高度的革命英雄主义精神，在我军强大炮兵部队和坦克部队的紧密配合下，运用了灵活的战术，抵住了敌人的进攻，大量的杀伤了敌军使进犯军遭受了比之过去更加惨重的失败——付出了重大的代价而不能前进一步。
    范佛里特发动金化地区攻势的日子，正是联合国第七届大会在纽约开幕的时候。他选择这一个“好日子”在朝鲜战场上发动了一年来最大的攻势，原是打算给美国侵略者捞回点屡次失败的面子，并且给仆从们打打气，向他们骗点炮灰。然而，打了一个多月的结果，侵略军却损失了两万多人，消耗了大量的装备和物资。这告诉人们：范佛里特是输定了。且听听从敌人阵营里面发出来的对他们失败的自供吧：
    “美军的伤亡率达到一年来的最高点。”
    “金化战役现在已经成了一个无底洞，它所吞食的联军军事资源要比任何一次中国军队的总攻势所吞食的都要多。”
    “中国的大炮发挥了惊人的作用。”
    “中国军队特别猛烈的炮火及看来无限的弹药一再使联军的步兵作战陷于瘫痪。”
    范佛里特已经没有什么东西可以挽救他的败局了。他本人已经急得像热锅上的蚂蚁，曾经在十月十八日、二十一日、十一月五日三次到前线“视察”，连克拉克和李承晚也匆匆赶来“打气”。但是，这又有什么用处呢？他们的士兵不是“至少有十次已经攻到距离山顶五十码的地方，没有一鼓作气地向前进攻”一下就退下去了吗？
    撤换将领吗？伪二师的师长已经从他的指挥部被赶走了。再投入后备力量吗？第八军的炮兵总预备队早就用上了，伪九师换下去整补不到一个星期就又被拉上来了，而且美二十五师也在最近赶上来替换了美七师……。试问：范佛里特还有多少赌注，还打算拿多少人命投到朝鲜战场的这个“无底洞”中来？究竟怎么办呢？就此罢休吗？继续进攻吗？这自然由范佛里特自己去选择了。不过，请这位美国将军切勿忘记美联社早在十一月二日就对他发出的忠告：“看来只是支出而已，不会有什么收入的。”
