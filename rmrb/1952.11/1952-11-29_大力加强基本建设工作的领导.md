Vigorously Strengthen Leadership in Basic Construction Work
Liu Xiufeng

This year's basic construction in the North China Region has been carried out under conditions of weak construction forces, extremely incomplete institutions, very tight schedules, and continuously increasing tasks. Thanks to the efforts of leaders at all levels and all employees in the construction sector, leadership organizations have been gradually established, business organizations have been reorganized, construction forces have been strengthened, patriotic production increase and economy campaigns have been launched, and advanced experiences have been promoted. By the end of the year, 87 percent of all tasks will be completed, and the quality is generally good. It is not easy to achieve such results in just three or four months.

However, from the perspective of organizational leadership, basic construction has not actually been placed in a primary position. Many leading cadres still favor leading production while neglecting leading basic construction. In many regions and grassroots units, basic construction remains the weakest link in the work. In addition, due to poor design, rushed commencement of work, imbalanced material supply, and lack of experience among cadres, rework and waste phenomena still exist in construction projects this year, and approximately 13 percent of the projects need to be completed across the year. The tasks for next year are expected to far exceed those of this year, and the existing construction forces in the region are far from capable of handling this huge task, especially the lack of design forces. Under these circumstances, we must do a series of tasks well:

First, strengthen the leadership of basic construction. Leaders at all levels must put basic construction in a primary position and must recognize its decisive role in determining the speed of national industrialization and changing our backward economic situation. Therefore, we must make the greatest determination, allocate a sufficient number of cadres, and quickly establish and strengthen basic construction leadership organizations, improve the construction engineering bureaus and urban construction bureaus of various provinces and cities, and the organizations of basic construction of various industrial systems; establish and strengthen the enterprise organizations for design and construction; all industrial management agencies and factories and mines should establish cadres specifically leading basic construction. Leaders at all levels should also pay attention to opening and strengthening schools and various short-term training courses for training basic construction cadres.

Second, strengthen the planning and organization of basic construction work. In terms of planning, we must proceed from the overall national concept and the perspective of long-term construction and key construction, distinguishing between primary and secondary, important and urgent, grasping the primary and taking care of the secondary but necessary. Avoid losing big because of small things and using forces evenly. The first step at present is to clarify the situation, count how many construction tasks there are next year, estimate how many forces there are (including surveying, exploration, design, construction, transportation, construction equipment, water and electricity supply, and other forces); how much force is still lacking, how much funding is needed, and how to solve it, and make an overall plan. Then, according to the plan, do a good job in specific organizational work, closely connect the relationships between various departments, and make the planning, approval, material supply, and labor allocation mutually adapt and timely. Taiyuan City's method of clearly dividing labor and dividing work scope among design, construction, and material supply departments, and implementing a contracted responsibility system is very good and can be promoted.

Third, strengthen the design work force and its leadership. This is currently the primary link in basic construction work. To this end, the following work needs to be done well:

(1) Each province and city should set up design institutions led by the Construction Engineering Bureau, so as to separate from construction and achieve design specialization. Industrial departments (bureaus) and professional bureaus of various provinces and cities should establish organizations that integrate design and construction.

(2) Use the following methods to solve the shortage of design forces: ① Recruit talents in large quantities; ② Draw a group of technical personnel from production departments and construction forces to design departments; ③ Use accelerated training methods to train a group of exploration, surveying, drilling, and junior design talents; ④ Equip a group of cadres and use the method of master teaching apprentice to practice on site; ⑤ Rationally use design personnel, let general non-technical personnel replace technical personnel in some auxiliary or secondary work, and concentrate highly skilled design personnel on major work; ⑥ Send old cadres to design departments to strengthen leadership.

(3) Establish a design progress plan, strengthen the planned management of design work, and formulate the design sequence according to the importance and urgency of the project. The design company should compile annual, quarterly, and monthly progress tables, and each engineering design should also have its own progress table. Strictly complete the design according to the plan.

(4) Strengthen the special responsibility system for design. Whether it is in charge of surveying, planning design, structure, water, electricity, or heating equipment..., a strict special responsibility system should be established in each link, and a piece-rate contracting responsibility system for design teams can be implemented to improve design quality and efficiency and ensure completion of tasks on schedule.

(5) Strengthen the preparation work before design, conduct investigations, exploration, and surveying in advance; contact relevant departments to understand and listen to the requirements of the local municipal construction leading bodies on urban construction; fully understand the intentions of the construction unit, and absorb owners and construction department technicians to participate in research and design, in order to avoid errors and reduce rework and repeated changes in drawings. In addition, during the construction process, design personnel must go deep into the construction site to listen to the opinions of construction personnel and promptly revise design drawings to avoid major mistakes.

(6) Establish a design review system. Design review organizations should be established in industrial departments (bureaus), professional management bureaus, construction engineering bureaus, and municipal construction bureaus to review the designs of related factories, national defense, civil buildings, and municipal construction respectively to reduce errors.

(7) Promote advanced experiences in design work, criticize the European and American capitalist ideas of some design personnel, earnestly study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and improve design efficiency and quality, so that we can avoid detours.

(8) Continue to formulate standard design drawings. At present, North China has initially formulated several types of drawings for medium-sized city dormitories, offices, schools, warehouses, auditoriums, etc. In addition, it is necessary to collect some old drawings for reference in order to save the existing design forces.

(9) Design personnel should be divided according to their abilities and expertise, and they should specialize in what they are good at designing.

(10) Design personnel must consider the safety and use effect of the building, such as whether the factory building is conducive to production. At the same time, oppose the phenomenon of excessively high safety factors, resulting in major waste.

(11) Standard drawing design or major buildings can also adopt model design methods, which are convenient for discussion and research, and for owners to choose and propose amendments. This can reduce design rework and multiple revisions of drawings, and the time can also be shortened by piecing together designs with standard models.

(12) Continue to revise the draft of the North China Region's construction engineering and labor material trial quotas and try to formulate design quotas, and collect materials to compile a manual of material utilization stress for easy calculation and learning.

Fourth, strengthen the organization and leadership of construction forces, mainly:

(1) Vigorously strengthen construction companies or construction companies. ① Send strong cadres to lead this work, which is a decisive link. At the same time, promote a group of old workers to be leading backbone of work areas and construction sites. ② Increase fixed workers to reach 15 to 30 percent of the total number of workers. Special attention should be paid to fixing the backbone of the construction industry - advanced groups, and strengthening their technical and political training. In addition, a large number of contract workers are needed, with clear agreements on when to come and go. ③ For the needs of construction, construction companies can attach some factories under permitted conditions, such as wood processing plants, metal equipment processing plants, etc.; in the future, gradually make various ready-made standard doors, windows, walls, etc. in the factory..., and a building can be made by installation. ④ Increase necessary machinery and tools, such as machinery required for vacuum solidification of concrete, etc.

(2) Seize the winter training work. Fixed workers and all technicians, construction managers, material clerks, payroll clerks, structural engineers, accountants, statisticians, etc. should be trained at the same time. The content of the training, for workers, is mainly to improve technology, supplemented by political and cultural education; management personnel mainly study plan management and other things related to their own business. Combined with winter training, the work of rectifying the organization should be carried out, cleaning up bad elements..., laying the foundation for next year's work.

(3) Formulate monthly, quarterly, and construction progress tables for each construction site according to the design progress table, and organize material, equipment, transportation, and tool preparation according to the construction site. The construction site needs to formulate a construction plan, and the storage addresses of wood, cement, bricks, tiles, etc., the supply of water and electricity, and temporary buildings must be properly arranged in advance so that construction can be carried out in an orderly manner next year.

(4) Improve material supply and management. ① Material supply must be timely, otherwise it will cause idleness, work stoppage, and waiting for materials. To this end, transportation forces and the organization and planning of transportation work must be strengthened. In winter, bricks, tiles, sand, soil, and wood must be transported to the construction site first, which can reduce the difficulty of insufficient transportation forces. ② Pay attention to the specifications and quality of materials. Each province and city should stipulate several standard specifications for materials, such as the size and quality of bricks and tiles. Strictly prevent using large materials for small purposes, using superior materials for inferior purposes, and achieve rational allocation. ③ The material reserve management should be gradually transferred from the financial department to the construction company for contracting and materials to reduce waste. At present, a contract relationship should be established with the construction company to gradually change the method of allocating materials and substituting payments.

(5) Implement an economic accounting system for work areas. Work areas or large construction sites can become independent economic accounting units and establish independent accounting systems.

(6) Strengthen construction management and continue to learn and promote various advanced experiences. Special attention should be paid to promoting the parallel flow operation method and carrying out rhythmic construction according to the instructions and charts. After some construction sites in Beijing and Tianjin implemented the method of parallel flow operation according to the instructions and charts, some of them improved efficiency by 120% and reduced working days by 30%. It is necessary to overcome the conservative views of some leading cadres and technicians who are afraid of "breaking old rules," using the excuse that "fast work is not good," not promoting large-scale projects for small-scale projects, not promoting construction for themselves or superficially dealing with it, shouting slogans, and not actually promoting it. At the same time, pay attention to reversing the tendency to only seek speed and not quality in promotion.

(7) Strengthen inspection work. Each construction company should have a specially established organization, and inspection systems should also be established between each construction site and process, and it should be implemented throughout every link and every section of the project. At the same time, the construction acceptance system should also be strengthened.

(8) Strengthen the safety, health, and welfare work of construction workers. The first is to seize the problem of housing, and temporarily build more sheds and temporary workshops. Secondly, special attention should be paid to environmental sanitation. The management of eating, drinking water, sleeping, etc. must be strengthened. Cooperatives should be established on the construction site to meet the needs of workers; in particular, health organizations should be established to solve the work-related injuries and common diseases of construction workers. All the rights that workers should enjoy as stipulated in the Trade Union Law and the Labor Insurance Regulations must be effectively guaranteed.

(9) We must attach great importance to political work on construction sites and strengthen the work of the Party, the Youth League, and the Trade Union.

(10) Improve the wage system and reward system. Change the current egalitarian old wage system. It is also necessary to establish a system similar to the factory director's fund system, etc., and rewards should be given for exceeding the task and reducing costs.

(11) The North China Basic Construction Engineering Company will try out winter construction methods for civil engineering projects in order to break the restrictions of winter climate.

Fifth, regarding urban construction work.

With the requirements of large-scale economic construction, many new cities will appear, and many cities will be expanded. Establishing a new modernized industrial city is a huge task. For us, it is completely a new problem and must be put on the agenda. What needs to be done quickly at present is: (1) Establish institutions and strengthen planning and design. Beijing, Tianjin, Baotou, Datong, Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, Handan, and Zhangjiakou should all establish urban construction committees to make them strong leading organizations for urban construction, leading urban planning and design and supervising and inspecting all construction work in the city, and set up special institutions for planning design, supervision and inspection. (2) Strengthen planning and closely cooperate with various departments. For example, the laying of water and sewer pipes and cables should be planned and combined by various departments to avoid the phenomenon of major road renovations. (3) In order to facilitate design and review, North China and Beijing and Tianjin can refer to Soviet experience and materials to study various urban construction standards, such as land use standards for various factories, warehouses, schools, government agencies, etc., the ratio of building area to open space, the standard of urban appearance requirements, etc., and set different standards according to different situations of large, medium, and small cities. Regarding the requirements for building levels, experience has proven that it is advisable to build more buildings in large and medium-sized cities. If the costs of municipal construction such as roads and sewers are compared, bungalows not only occupy more land but are also uneconomical. (4) Unify the allocation of surveying, design and planning forces to solve the difficulties of insufficient forces in some cities. When using forces, pay attention to using them in a focused manner, and gradually cultivate new forces in the planning and design process.

(5) North China plans to set up an urban construction research class in winter, convening a group of old cadres and specialized personnel for urban construction in various cities to exchange experiences and teach some preliminary knowledge. (6) Each city should establish an urban construction engineering company (it would be better to have a design company) under the leadership of the Construction Bureau, implement enterprise management, and the government and the company should sign contracts for all urban construction projects, such as roads, sewers, bridges, etc., to promote its gradual implementation of economic accounting system. The current supply system must be changed. (7) All urban planning and design should implement the policy of serving production and serving the working people, and at the same time, we must look at the long term and find the basis from the nature and requirements of social and economic development. Therefore, we must learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and oppose the European and American capitalist urban construction views. (8) In addition to paying attention to economy, applicability, solidity, and beauty, urban housing construction should also appropriately take care of national forms and preserve valuable cultural relics.

In short, basic construction work is a new task, and all cadres should study this work well. In particular, leaders at all levels must quickly learn how to lead basic construction, conscientiously summarize and exchange experiences in this area, and improve basic construction work in order to meet the needs of national construction.

    大力加强基本建设工作的领导
    刘秀峰
    华北区今年的基本建设，是在建筑力量薄弱、机构极不健全、时间十分仓促，而任务又不断增加的情况下进行的。由于各级领导及建筑部门全体职工的努力，在工作中逐渐建立了领导机构，整理了业务机构，充实了建筑力量，展开了爱国主义增产节约竞赛，推广了先进经验，至年底能完成全部任务的百分之八十七，质量一般还好。在短短的三四个月内能够获得这样的成绩，是很不容易的。
    但是，从组织领导上来看，实际上基本建设还未被放到首要的地位。仍有不少领导干部偏重对生产的领导而忽视对基本建设的领导，在不少地区和基层单位，基本建设依然是工作中最薄弱的环节。加之由于设计不周、开工仓促、材料供应失调、干部缺乏经验，因而今年建筑工程中的返工浪费现象依然存在，且约有百分之十三的工程需要跨年度才能完成。明年的任务，预计将远远超过今年，全区现有的建筑力量远不能胜任这一巨大任务，特别是设计力量缺乏。在这种情况下，就要求我们必须做好一系列的工作：
    一、加强基本建设的领导。各级领导上必须把基本建设放到首要的地位，必须认识它对于决定国家工业化速度和改变我们的经济落后状况具有决定性的作用。从而下最大的决心，调配足够数量的干部，迅速建立与充实基本建设领导机构，健全各省市建筑工程局、城市建设局以及各工业系统基本建设的组织；建立、充实设计与施工的企业组织；各工业管理机构和厂矿均应设置专门领导基本建设的干部。各级领导上并应注意开办与加强培养基本建设干部的学校和各种短期训练班。
    二、加强基本建设工作的计划性和组织性。在计划方面，必须从国家整体观念和长期建设、重点建设的观点出发进行工程排队，分别主要次要、轻重缓急，抓住主要的，照顾次要而必需的。切忌因小失大，平均使用力量。目前第一步工作是弄清情况，统计明年到底有多少建筑任务，估算有多少力量（包括测量、勘察、设计、施工、运输、建筑器材、水电供给等各种力量）；还缺多少力量，需要多少资金，如何解决，作出通盘计划。然后根据计划做好具体的组织工作，密切各部门的关系，作到计划、批审、材料供应、劳动调配的互相适应和及时。太原市在设计、施工、材料供应各部门之间进行明确分工、划分工作范围，实行包干负责连环合同制的办法很好，可以推广。
    三、加强设计工作的力量及其领导，这是目前基本建设工作的首要一环。为此需作好以下工作：
    （一）各省市应设设计机构，由建筑工程局领导，以便与施工分开，做到设计专业化。各省市工业厅
    （局）、各专业局则应建立设计与施工综合的组织。
    （二）用以下办法解决设计力量之不足：①大量搜罗人才；②从生产部门和施工力量中抽一批技术人员到设计部门；③用速成训练法培养一批勘查、测绘、钻探和初级设计人才；④配备一批干部，用师傅带徒弟的办法到现场实习；⑤合理地使用设计人员，让一般非技术人员去代替技术人员的某些辅助性的或次要的工作，把技术较高的设计人员集中用到主要工作上；⑥派老干部到设计部门，加强领导。
    （三）订立设计进度计划，加强设计工作的计划管理，并按工程的轻重缓急拟定设计的次序。设计公司要编出全年的、每季的、每月的进度表，每个工程设计也需有自己的进度表。严格地按计划完成设计。
    （四）加强设计的专责制，无论管勘测的、管平面设计的、管结构的、管水、电、暖气设备的……，每个环节都要建立严格的专责制度，并可实行设计小组计件包干负责制，以提高设计质量和效率，保证按进度完成任务。
    （五）加强设计前的准备工作，事先进行调查，勘察，测绘；与有关部门联系，了解与听取当地市政建设领导机关对市容建设的要求；充分了解建筑单位的意图，吸收业主与施工部门技术人员参加研究和设计，以避免错误，减少返工及屡改图样的现象。此外，在施工过程中，设计人员必须深入工地听取施工人员的意见，及时修正设计图样，以免铸成大错。
    （六）建立设计审核制度，在工业厅（局）、专业管理局、建筑工程局及市政建设局建立设计审核组织，分别审核有关工厂、国防、土木建筑及市政建设的设计，减少错误。
    （七）推广设计工作方面的先进经验，批判某些设计人员的欧美资本主义思想，认真学习苏联先进经验，提高设计效率和质量，使我们少走弯路。
    （八）继续制订标准设计图样。现在华北初步制订了中等城市宿舍、办公室、学校、仓库、礼堂等数种图样。此外，还需搜集一些旧有的图样作参考，用以节省现有设计力量。
    （九）设计人员按能力和特长分工，精于设计什么就专门设计什么。
    （十）设计人员必须考虑到建筑的安全与使用效果，如工厂建筑是否有利于生产。同时反对安全系数过高，致造成重大浪费的现象。
    （十一）标准图样设计或重大建筑可兼采用模型设计办法，便于讨论研究，并供业主选择和提出修正意见，这样可减少设计返工和多次修改图样的现象，同时用标准模型加以拼凑设计，时间也可缩短。
    （十二）继续修订华北区建筑工程、工料试行定额草案和试行制订设计定额，并搜集材料编制各种材料的利用应力手册，以便于计算和学习。
    四、加强施工力量的组织与领导，主要是：
    （一）大力加强建筑公司或施工公司。①派强的干部去领导这种工作，这是决定环节。同时从老工人中提拔一批做工区工地的领导骨干。②增加固定工人，达到占工人总数百分之十五到三十。特别要注意把建筑业中的骨干——先进小组固定下来，加强对他们的技术和政治训练。此外还需要一大批合同工人，明文约定，来去有时。③为了施工的需要，建筑公司在条件许可下，可附设一些工厂，如木材加工厂、金属器材加工厂等；将来逐步做到在工厂中做好各种现成的标准门窗、墙壁……，经过安装就是一所建筑物。④增加必要的器械与工具，如混凝土真空凝固所需机器等。
    （二）抓紧冬季训练工作，对固定工人和所有技工、施工管理人员、材料员、工资员、结构员、会计员、统计员等，都要同时加以训练。训练内容，对工人主要是提高技术，附以政治文化教育；管理人员主要学习计划管理等与本身业务有关的东西。结合冬训应进行整顿组织的工作，清洗坏分子……，为明年工作打下基础。
    （三）根据设计进度表拟订月度的、季度的、每个工地的施工进度表，按工地组织材料、设备、运输力与工具等准备工作。工地需订出施工平面图，木材、洋灰、砖瓦等的存放地址，水、电的供给与临时建筑，事先都要有适当的安排，以便明年井然有序地进行施工。
    （四）改善材料供应与管理工作。①材料供应必须及时，否则就会造成窝工、停工待料现象，为此必须加强运输力量与运输的组织工作和计划性，在冬季需先将砖瓦沙土木材运到工地，可以减少运输力不足的困难。②注意材料的规格和质量，各省市应该订出几种物料的标准规格，如砖瓦等的尺寸和质量。切防大材小用、优材劣用，要做到合理的调配。③材料的储备管理应由财政部门负责逐渐过渡到由建筑公司包工包料，以减少浪费。目前应与建筑公司建立合同关系，逐渐改变拨料代款的办法。
    （五）实行工区经济核算制。工区或大的工地都可成为单独的经济核算单位，建立独立的会计制度。
    （六）加强施工管理工作，继续学习与推广各种先进经验。特别要注意推行平行流水作业法，按指示图表进行有节奏的施工。北京、天津有些工地实行平行流水作业按指示图表施工的方法以后，有的提高效率百分之一百二十，减少百分之三十的工作日。要克服部分领导干部和技术人员中所存在的怕“打破老规矩”，藉口“快了没好活”，小工程推广大工程不推广，给别人建筑推广给自己建筑不推广或表面应付、空喊空叫实际上不推广等保守观点。同时注意扭转推广中只求快不求好的偏向。
    （七）加强检查工作。各建筑公司应有专设机构，各工地与工序之间也应建立检查制度，把它贯彻到每一个环节和每段工程的始终。同时并要加强施工验收制度。
    （八）加强建筑工人的安全卫生福利工作。首先是抓紧解决住房问题，暂时多修些工棚、临时工房也好。其次要特别注意环境卫生，吃饭、饮水、睡觉等的管理都必须加强，工地应建立合作社满足工人需要；特别应成立卫生机构，解决建筑工人工伤及容易发生的疾病。凡是工会法、劳动保险条例上规定的工人应享受的权利都要切实得到保障。
    （九）必须十分重视工地的政治工作，加强党、青年团、工会的工作。
    （十）改善工资制度和奖励制度。改变现行的平均主义旧工资制度。并要建立类似厂长基金制等制度，对超过任务，降低了费用的都应给予奖励。
    （十一）由华北基本建设工程公司试行土建工程冬季施工法，以求打破冬季气候的限制。
    五、关于城市建设工作。
    随着大规模经济建设的要求，要有许多新的城市出现，好多城市要扩大建设。建立一个新的近代化的工业城市，任务是巨大的，对我们来说完全是一个新的问题，必须把它列到议事日程上来。目前需要很快着手做的是：（一）建立机构，加强规划设计。北京、天津、包头、大同、太原、石家庄、唐山、邯郸、张家口九个城市都需建立城市建设委员会，使它成为城市建设强有力的领导组织，领导城市规划设计和监督、检查城市的一切建设工作，并设规划设计、监督检查的专门机构。（二）加强计划性，与各部门密切配合。如上下水道、马路、电缆的敷设，各有关部门要有计划地结合，避免马路大翻身的现象。（三）为了便于设计和审核，可由华北和北京、天津参考苏联经验和材料，研究各种有关城市建设标准，如各种工厂、仓库、学校、机关等用地标准、建筑面积与空地的比例、市容要求的标准等等，按大中小城市不同的情况订出不同的标准。关于建筑层次的要求，经验证明大中城市以多建楼房为宜，如把马路、下水道等市政建设费用合计比较，平房不但占地多且不经济。（四）统一调配勘察、设计规划力量，以解决一部分城市力量不足的困难。在使用力量时，要注意有重点地使用，并要在规划设计过程中逐渐培养新的力量。
    （五）华北拟在冬季设立城市建设研究班，召集一批老干部和各市市镇建设专门人材交换经验，讲授一些初步知识。（六）各市在建设局领导下最好建立城市建筑工程公司（能分设计公司更好），实行企业化管理，一切市镇建设工程，如马路、下水道、桥梁等，应由政府与公司订立合同，促其逐步实行经济核算制。目前的供给制办法必须改变。（七）一切市镇规划设计应贯彻为生产服务、为劳动人民服务的方针，同时要从长期着眼，从社会经济发展性质与要求找根据。因此必须学习苏联的先进经验，反对欧美式资本主义市政建设观点。（八）城市房屋建设除注意经济、适用、坚固、美观外，并要适当地照顾民族形式，保留有价值的文化古迹。
    总之，基本建设工作是一个新的任务，所有的干部应该很好地学习这一工作，特别是各级领导上必须尽速地学会对基本建设的领导，认真总结和交流这方面的经验，把基本建设工作提高一步，以适应国家建设的需要。
