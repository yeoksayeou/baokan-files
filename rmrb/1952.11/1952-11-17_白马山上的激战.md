    Fierce Battle on White Horse Mountain

    In the Yaoshandong area, ten kilometers northwest of Tieyuan, there is a cluster of hills dominated by the 394.8 high ground – what the enemy calls "White Horse Mountain." The southeast side of the mountain is a plain that leads directly to Tieyuan, an important supply base for the U.S. invading army. The Li pseudo-army's 9th Division had entrenched itself on "White Horse Mountain" for nearly a year, constructing many large bunkers, small bunkers, mother-and-son bunkers, open bunkers, and hidden bunkers. The mountain was crisscrossed with communication trenches and barbed wire, and there were also many mines and traps. The enemy boasted that this mountain was a "steel fortress" on the "United Nations Forces" front line.

    Our Volunteer Army unit launched a counterattack on October 6th and completely occupied this "steel fortress" by the 8th. Then, they fought off the enemy's counterattacks there until the night of the 14th, when they successfully completed the task of annihilating the enemy before returning victoriously to their own positions. In the nine days of battle, our army wiped out more than 8,000 men from the Li pseudo-army's 9th Division. This battle was an outstanding joint assault by the Volunteer Army's infantry and artillery.

    At 6:00 AM on October 6th, our artillery began to bombard the enemy's fortifications on the 394.8 high ground. Amidst the huge, continuous bombardment, the telephones in the various artillery command posts kept ringing with simple reports: "Target number so-and-so completely destroyed!" "Target number so-and-so hit!" "Target number so-and-so, continue firing..." Looking through the artillery telescopes, we could see shells accurately landing on the enemy's hilltop. Sandbags, wood, and barbed wire flew into the air along with the black plumes of smoke, and most of the enemy's above-ground fortifications were destroyed by the artillery fire.

    The officers of the Li pseudo-army's 9th Division, terrified, burrowed into their dugouts and wailed into their radios, saying that they were suffering an unprecedentedly fierce artillery bombardment, begging their American masters to quickly send aircraft for support.

    As the aircraft rushing to the rescue of the pseudo-9th Division had just flown into the airspace above the battlefield, our anti-aircraft artillery opened fire. The sky was suddenly filled with the smoke clouds of exploding anti-aircraft shells. In a short while, three enemy planes each trailed a stream of black smoke and plunged from the sky. The other enemy planes hurriedly hid in the high altitude.

    At 5:30 PM, the general offensive began. The artillerymen again rained down shells like a storm on the 394.8 high ground, and then the brave infantry assault teams began to move. Sappers braved the enemy's artillery fire to blow up the remaining barbed wire on the road ahead, allowing the assault teams to rush into the enemy's lines. An enemy heavy machine gun on the mountain was frantically blocking the breakthrough. Rocket launcher Wang Haichao destroyed the heavy machine gun with one shot. Sapper Squad Leader Li Dongshan and soldier Liu Lianxi used hand grenades and anti-tank grenades to take out several bunkers in succession.

    As a result of the assault teams' heroic fighting, the enemy's forward positions were broken through. Most of the enemies there were blown to pieces in the fortifications and bunkers, and the remaining few enemies were scurrying around like headless flies.

    The enemy panicked and sent the 3rd Battalion of the 30th Regiment of the pseudo-9th Division to reinforce them overnight. Along with the 1st Battalion and 2nd Battalion of the pseudo-9th Division's 30th Regiment that were originally there, a full regiment of troops was crammed onto these small hills.

    Our army's assault teams continued to advance towards the enemy's depth, charging and smashing their way through. After a night of fierce fighting, they occupied five or six hilltops north of the 394.8 high ground's main peak. By this point, most of the pseudo-9th Division's 30th Regiment had been annihilated, and the remnants retreated to the main peak of the 394.8 high ground.

    The next day, the pseudo-9th Division sent its main force, the 28th Regiment, to reinforce them,妄想trying to hold their main peak.

    At dusk, our army launched a strong attack on the main peak again with the cooperation of fierce artillery fire. There, most of the bunkers built above ground had been destroyed by artillery fire, and many enemy soldiers had been crushed to death inside. The remaining enemies retreated into hidden bunkers to resist stubbornly. Assault Squad Leader Sun Lianfang was rushing in front when he suddenly noticed sparks popping up on the ground ahead. Looking closely, he saw that the enemy was firing a machine gun from a hidden bunker. He immediately bravely threw an anti-tank grenade into a gun hole of the hidden bunker that was emitting gunfire, blowing up the enemies and the machine gun inside. The brave soldiers quickly used various methods to eliminate many enemies in the hidden bunkers, quickly rushed up the hill, and completely occupied the main peak of the 394.8 high ground. At this time, the light in the enemy commander's shelter on the top of the mountain was still on, and the wireless telephone was still screaming, but the enemy officer had already rolled down the mountain.

    On the third day, the enemy launched a counterattack under the cover of aircraft and artillery,妄想trying to recapture the position. Thus, a fierce battle for the hilltops unfolded between the enemy and us.

    The enemy used more than 100 artillery pieces and a dozen aircraft to bombard the main peak of the 394.8 high ground wildly, and drove the remnants of the 28th Regiment of the Li pseudo-army to launch continuous fierce attacks, but were stubbornly resisted by our army's brave soldiers. In the battle, political instructor Gao Yuntian used a captured heavy machine gun to sweep fiercely at the enemy. Communicators and buglers also actively participated in the battle, collecting enemy hand grenades everywhere to throw at the enemy. That day, our army repelled fifteen fierce enemy assaults in succession.

    In the last battle, the enemy cobbled together more than a battalion of troops and charged up the mountain. Company commander Sun Chenggang let the enemy rush to within eighty meters of the top of the mountain before using a wireless telephone to notify the artillery to open fire. In an instant, shells rained down on the enemy ranks, blowing the enemies' heads and limbs everywhere. At this time, Sun Chenggang and the soldiers used machine guns and hand grenades to fiercely attack the enemies close at hand. As a result, a large number of enemies in one battalion were killed and wounded on the ridge, and only a few were fortunate enough to roll down the mountain. Then, the brave soldiers of our army on the main peak, with the support of artillery, launched a brave attack and took advantage of the victory to wipe out the remaining enemies on several small hilltops south of the main peak. At 4:00 AM in the deep night, a signal was raised in the sky indicating the complete occupation of the position.

    From then on, our army continued to engage in fierce battles with the enemy in this area of hills, repeatedly fighting for every bunker, every section of communication trench, and every meter of land. The enemy was attracted over, and then a large number of them were annihilated, until the night of the 14th, when our army victoriously returned to its own positions. According to rough statistics, from the 6th to the 14th, our army killed and wounded more than 8,000 soldiers of the Li pseudo-army's 9th Division. The three regiments of this division—the 28th, 29th, and 30th regiments—were all crippled. In the battle, it was also discovered that there were a large number of new recruits temporarily replenished from Jeju Island, Chuncheon and other places in the Li pseudo-army. These new recruits were driven to the battlefield to be cannon fodder as soon as they got off the bus. Therefore, the American news agency sadly called the 394.8 high ground the second "Heartbreak Ridge" on the Korean battlefield.

### 白马山上的激战

    白马山上的激战
    新华社记者　王玉章
    在铁原西北十公里的药山洞地区，有一群以三九四点八高地为主的山头——就是敌人所称的“白马山”，山的东南面是一片平地，可直达美国侵略军的重要兵站基地铁原。李伪军第九师在“白马山”上盘踞了将近一年，在那里构筑了许多大地堡、小地堡、子母堡、明堡和暗堡；山上交通沟、铁丝网纵横交错，并且还有许多地雷和陷阱。敌人吹嘘这座山是“联合国军”战线上的“钢铁阵地”。
    我志愿军某部在十月六日发起反击，到八日全部占领了这座“钢铁阵地”，接着就在那里打击前来反扑的敌人，直到十四日夜间完成歼敌任务以后，才胜利地回到自己的阵地。在九天的战斗中，我军消灭了李伪军第九师八千多人。这个战斗是志愿军步兵和炮兵联合进行的一次杰出的攻坚战。
    十月六日上午六时，我军炮兵就开始对敌人三九四点八高地上的工事进行破坏轰击。在巨大的连续的轰击声中，各炮兵指挥所里的电话不断地响着简单的声音：“某某号目标已全部摧毁！”“某某号目标命中！”“某某号目标继续射击……”从炮队镜望出去，只见一颗颗炮弹准确地落在敌人的山头上。草包、木料和铁丝网随着黑色的烟柱飞上半空，敌人暴露在地面上的工事大部被炮火摧毁。
    李伪军第九师的军官吓得钻在地洞里对着报话机哀叫，说他们正遭受到空前猛烈的炮火轰击，乞求美国主子快派飞机来支援。
    当赶来救援伪九师的飞机刚刚飞到战场上空时，我军的高射炮开火了，天空中骤然布满了高射炮弹爆炸的烟团，一会儿就有三架敌机各拖着一股黑烟从空中栽了下来，其他的敌机慌慌张张地躲到高空中去了。
    下午五时三十分总攻开始。炮兵们又把急风暴雨般的炮弹打向三九四点八高地，接着勇猛的步兵突击队也开始行动了。爆破手冒着敌人的炮火，把前
    进道路上残存下来的铁丝网炸开，让突击队冲入敌
    阵。山上敌人的一挺重机枪正在疯狂地封锁突破口，火箭筒射手王海潮一炮就把这挺重机枪打毁了。爆破班长李东山和战士刘连喜用手榴弹和反坦克手雷接连打下了几个地堡。
    突击队英勇作战的结果，敌人的前沿阵地被突破了。那里的敌人大部被炸烂在工事和地堡里，剩下的几个敌人也像没头苍蝇似的到处乱钻。
    敌人慌了手脚，连夜又派伪九师三十团第三营来增援，加上原在那里的伪九师三十团的第一营和第二营，在这些不大的山头上就足足挤上了一个团的兵力。
    我军各路突击队继续向着敌人的纵深挺进，横冲直撞，经过彻夜激战，又占领了三九四点八高地主峰以北的五、六个山头。至此，伪九师三十团大部被歼，残部退缩在三九四点八高地的主峰上。
    第二天，伪九师又派出它的主力部队第二十八团前来增援，妄想守住他们的主峰。
    黄昏，我军又在猛烈炮火配合下强攻主峰。在那里，筑在地面上的地堡已大部被炮火摧毁，许多敌兵被压死在里面，残敌都转入暗堡进行顽抗。突击班长孙连芳正冲在前面，忽然发现前面地上突突地冒出火花来，仔细一看，原来是敌人在暗堡里打机枪；他立即勇猛地把一个反坦克手雷甩进一个冒着枪火的暗堡枪眼，将里面的敌人和机枪炸了个粉碎。勇士们用各种办法很快地消灭了许多暗堡里的敌人，迅速地冲上山头，完全占领了三九四点八高地的主峰。这时山顶上敌军指挥官的掩蔽部里的灯还亮着，无线电话机也在哇哇地乱叫，可是，敌军军官却早已滚到山下去了。
    第三天白天，敌人就在飞机大炮掩护下前来反扑，妄想夺回阵地。于是，敌我双方展开了激烈的山头争夺战。
    敌人用一百多门大炮、十几架飞机向着三九四点八高地主峰狂轰滥炸，并驱使李伪军第九师二十八团的残部连续猛扑，但遭到了我军勇士的顽强阻击。在战斗中，政治指导员高云田用缴获来的重机枪向敌人猛扫。通讯员、司号员也都积极参加战斗，到处搜集敌人丢遗的手榴弹来打敌人。这一天我军连续打退了敌人十五次凶猛的冲锋。
    最后一次战斗，敌人拼凑了一个多营的兵力向山上冲来。连长孙成刚让敌人冲到离山顶不到八十公尺时，用无线电话通知炮兵开火。霎时间炮弹暴雨般地落进敌群，打得敌人的头颅、四肢到处乱飞。这时孙成刚和战士们又用机关枪、手榴弹猛烈地打击近在身前的敌人。结果，一个营的敌人都大批地被打死打伤在山岭上，只有几个侥幸地滚下山去。接着，主峰上的我军勇士在炮兵支援下勇猛出击，乘胜肃清了主峰以南几个小山头上的残敌。深夜四时，在天空中升起了全部占领阵地的信号。
    从这以后，我军又继续在这一带山岭上与敌人进行激烈的战斗，反复争夺着每一个地堡，每一段交通壕，每一公尺土地。把敌人吸引过来，然后大批地消灭它，一直到十四日夜间，我军才胜利地返回自己的阵地。据粗略统计，从六日到十四日，我军共杀伤李伪军第九师八千多名，这个师的三个团
    ——二十八、二十九和三十团，都被打成了残废。在战斗中，还发现在李伪军中有大批临时从济州岛、春川等地补充来的新兵，这些新兵刚下汽车就被驱到战场作了炮灰。所以美国通讯社悲痛地把三九四点八高地叫做朝鲜战场上的第二个“伤心岭”。
