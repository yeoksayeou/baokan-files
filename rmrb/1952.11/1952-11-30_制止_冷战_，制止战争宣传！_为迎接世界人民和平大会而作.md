    Stop the "Cold War", Stop War Propaganda!
    -- Written to welcome the World People's Peace Congress
    Vice-Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace
    Editor-in-Chief of Ta Kung Pao, Wang Yunsheng

    I am a Chinese journalist who has worked in the field of journalism for over twenty years. I have personally witnessed the warlord infighting during China's semi-colonial era and the suffering of the Chinese people during the eight years of Japanese aggression against China; after the Chinese people were liberated, American imperialism colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to launch a counter-revolutionary civil war; even after the Chinese people were liberated, American imperialism still occupied our territory of Taiwan and launched a war of aggression in Korea; when the people of the world yearn for peace, the warmongers are conducting a "Cold War" and promoting war. All this cannot but make me resentful. The "Cold War" and war propaganda are seriously persecuting the peaceful minds of good people around the world and are seriously threatening the peace and happiness of good people around the world. Therefore, I would like to appeal to the World People's Peace Congress to be opened soon in Vienna, and appeal to the just and good opinions of the whole world: Please stop the "Cold War" immediately, stop war propaganda!

    Molotov pointed out as early as March 1950 that the newspapers of the aggressor countries "are constantly and endlessly shouting about the need to pursue the so-called 'Cold War' policy against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, demanding a significant increase in military budgets, continuously building new military bases, and continuing to implement policies that forever threaten the peace-loving countries in the democratic camp. The capitalists in the Anglo-American bloc are taking advantage of this to obtain more war orders and billions of new profits." It was for the profits of the monopoly capitalists in obtaining military orders that the American warmongers launched the war of aggression against Korea in June 1950; it was for the profits of the monopoly capitalists in obtaining military orders that the American warmongers stubbornly created the issue of forcibly detaining prisoners of war to sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations and continue the Korean War; it was for the profits of the monopoly capitalists in obtaining military orders that the American warmongers were carrying out a world-scale arms race and mobilizing all propaganda machines to conduct war propaganda.

    Now Truman is boasting about the so-called "hydrogen bomb" to expand the "Cold War." British peace fighter Professor Bernal said: "Every month the Cold War continues means a divided world with absolute barriers to trade; ... it means maintaining large armies and the constant threat of war." The "Cold War" means war and the massacre of mankind. This ominous thing, the "Cold War," is only for a small group of monopoly capitalists to obtain the profits of military orders, so it is an extremely sinful thing. Good men and women all over the world unite to stop the "Cold War"!

    Humanity created language and writing originally to enrich culture and happy life, but unfortunately, it has been used by the warmongers to promote war that creates death and even destruction for mankind. Tursun Sade, the Soviet representative attending the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, said: "The first law of mankind is peace." Therefore, human laws do not allow the incitement of war, and human laws should prohibit war propaganda. Article 49 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates: "Protect the freedom to report true news. It is forbidden to use news to slander, undermine the interests of the state and the people, and incite world war." Our Chinese journalists are working in accordance with this sacred and solemn law, serving the country and the people. The journalists of New China enjoy full freedom of the press, but are prohibited from inciting world war and war propaganda.

    Please see how the American bourgeois journalists do it! They talk about so-called "freedom of the press" at every turn, but in reality, they are deceiving the people, and in reality, they are "free to report news" for the imperialist policy of aggression and the huge profits of monopoly capitalists. American bourgeois journalists are using the hypocritical "freedom of the press" as a guise, but in reality, they are acting in accordance with the three sentences that they use as professional secrets, which are: "Record everything heard," "Do not record everything heard," and "Fabricate rumors when nothing is heard." Their way of doing things is: everything that is beneficial to the imperialist policy of aggression and the interests of monopoly capitalists is "recorded"; everything that is not beneficial to the imperialist policy of aggression and the interests of monopoly capitalists is "not recorded"; everything that is needed for the imperialist policy of aggression and the interests of monopoly capitalists but for which there is no news is "fabricated." Anyone who has read American bourgeois newspapers and magazines can find endless examples based on these three sentences, so I will not give examples. In short, they will stop at nothing to promote racial discrimination, the oppression of people by people, aggression, and incitement to war; in order to deceive the people, they can fabricate great rumors.

    The tools of the American monopoly capitalists have always been unscrupulously promoting war. If everyone is not forgetful, they will still remember that the American "Collier's" magazine published words and pictures last year, insisting that a new world war would break out in 1952 and end in 1960, and the result would be that the United States would occupy the Soviet Union. The picture showed an American military policeman wearing a steel helmet and holding a drawn bayonet standing across the map of the Soviet Union. This is already absurd to the extreme. Eisenhower also delivered an extremely arrogant campaign speech at the National Convention of the American Legion of Veterans in New York on August 25 this year, saying that he would use force to "liberate" countries from the Soviet Union's Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Eastern European People's Democracies all the way to China and Mongolia. "Collier's" and Eisenhower are singing the same tune, they are frantically promoting war and clamoring for war. Eisenhower said as early as May 24, 1946, at the meeting of the Georgia State Bar Association in the United States: "American soldiers who have received excellent combat training are the world's most powerful machines for creating destruction." In this year's campaign, he also said that he would use force to "liberate" from Eastern Europe to China. He is a war-monger with fangs and claws. However, in order to win votes, Eisenhower finally chanted the "peace" mantra, saying that if elected, he would immediately go to Korea himself to end the war as soon as possible. This is complete deception. He has not yet gone to Korea, but for the sake of the profits of military orders for the Wall Street monopoly capitalists, he declared his support for Truman's policy of forcibly detaining Chinese and Korean prisoners of war, sabotaging the Korean armistice negotiations, and continuing the war of aggression against Korea. Obviously, if Eisenhower goes to Korea, he will definitely not go to end the war, but to "strengthen" and expand the war. The American people are being deceived more and more, and the "peace" mantra in the mouths of war criers is absolutely deceptive.

    The American people have reached the time of hearing and seeing clearly. You should listen to and see through all the false and deceptive propaganda, and work with the peace-loving people of the world to stop the "Cold War," stop war propaganda, oppose war, and save peace. This is in the interests of good men and women all over the world, and it is also in the interests of the American people.

    I would like to, in the capacity of a Chinese journalist, respectfully wish the World People's Peace Congress to be held soon in Vienna a great victory; and appeal to the just and good opinions of the whole world: Stop the "Cold War," stop war propaganda!

    制止“冷战”，制止战争宣传！
    ——为迎接世界人民和平大会而作
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会上海市分会副主席
    大公报总编辑  王芸生
    我是一个中国新闻工作者，我在新闻工作岗位上已经工作了二十多年。我亲眼看到了中国半殖民地时代的军阀混战和日本侵略中国的八年中中国人民所受的痛苦；日本投降以后，美帝国主义又勾结蒋介石匪帮发动反人民的内战；在中国人民获得解放以后，美帝国主义还霸占我们的领土台湾，又在朝鲜进行侵略战争；当全世界人民渴望和平的时候，战争贩子们却在进行“冷战”，宣传战争。这些，都是不能不使我痛恨的。“冷战”与战争宣传，是在严重迫害着全世界善良人民的和平心灵，是在严重威胁着全世界善良人民的和平幸福。为此，我谨向即将在维也纳开幕的世界人民和平大会发出呼吁，向全世界公正善良的舆论发出呼吁：请即制止“冷战”，制止战争宣传！
    莫洛托夫早于一九五○年三月指出：侵略国家的报纸“整天无休无止地喊叫需要奉行反对苏联和人民民主国家的所谓‘冷战’政策，要求大大增加军事预算，不断地建设新军事基地，继续执行永远威胁民主阵营中爱好和平国家的政策。英美集团各国的资本家们却利用这个来取得更多的战争订货和亿万元新的利润。”就是为了垄断资本家们取得军事订货的利润，美国战争贩子于一九五○年六月发动了侵略朝鲜的战争；就是为了垄断资本家们取得军事订货的利润，美国战争贩子硬制造一个强迫扣留战俘的题目，以破坏朝鲜停战谈判，使朝鲜战争继续打下去；就是为了垄断资本家们取得军事订货的利润，美国战争贩子进行着世界规模的扩军备战，并发动一切宣传机器进行战争宣传。
    现在杜鲁门又在夸耀所谓“氢弹”，以扩大“冷战”。英国和平战士贝尔纳教授说：“冷战继续下去的每一个月，都意味着一个分裂的世界，存在着贸易的绝对壁垒；……它意味着维持大量军队和时刻存在的战争威胁。”“冷战”就意味着战争与毁灭人类的大屠杀。“冷战”这个不祥的东西，却只是为了一小撮垄断资本家取得军事订货的利润，所以它是极端罪恶的东西，全世界爱好和平的善良男女一致起来，制止“冷战”！
    人类创造语言和文字，原是为了丰富文化和幸福生活的，却不幸被战争贩子们利用来宣传为人类制造死亡以至毁灭的战争。出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的苏联代表图尔逊·萨德说：“人类第一条法律是和平”。因此，人类的法律也不允许煽动战争，人类的法律是应该禁止战争宣传的。中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第四十九条是这样规定着：“保护报道真实新闻的自由。禁止利用新闻以进行诽谤，破坏国家人民的利益和煽动世界战争。”我们中国新闻工作者就按照这一条神圣庄严的法律而工作着，为国家人民服务着。新中国的新闻工作者享有充分的新闻自由，但却禁止煽动世界战争，禁止战争宣传。
    请看看美国资产阶级的新闻记者是怎样干的吧！他们开口闭口讲所谓“新闻自由”，实际是欺骗人民，实际是为帝国主义的侵略政策及垄断资本家的巨额利润而“新闻自由”。美国资产阶级的新闻记者是在利用虚伪的“新闻自由”做幌子，而实际是在按照他们作为职业秘诀的三句话而行事，这三句话就是：“有闻必录”、“有闻不录”、“无闻造谣”。他们的干法是：凡是有利于帝国主义侵略政策及垄断资本家利益的，就“有闻必录”；凡是不利于帝国主义侵略政策及垄断资本家利益的，就“有闻不录”；凡是为帝国主义侵略政策及垄断资本家利益所需要而却无此新闻时，就“无闻造谣”。凡是读过美国资产阶级的报纸杂志的，都能根据这三句话找出无穷无尽的例子，所以我不举例。总之，他们宣传种族歧视，宣传人压迫人，宣传侵略，煽动战争，就无所不用其极；为了欺骗人民，他们可以造弥天的大谣。
    美国垄断资本家的工具一贯是肆无忌惮地宣传战争。大家如不健忘，总还记得美国“柯里尔”杂志曾于去年发表文字和图画，硬说新的世界大战要在
    一九五二年爆发，至一九六○年结束，结果是美国占领了苏联。图画上画着一个头戴钢盔的美国宪兵持着露刃的步枪横亘在苏联地图上。这已经够荒谬绝伦的了。艾森豪威尔也在今年八月二十五日在纽约美国退伍军人团全国代表大会发表一篇狂妄透顶的竞选演说，他说他要用武力“解放”从苏联的爱沙尼亚、拉脱维亚、立陶宛和东欧各人民民主国家一直到中国和蒙古等国。“柯里尔”、艾森豪威尔一鼻孔出气，他们疯狂地宣传战争，叫嚣战争。艾森豪威尔早在一九四六年五月二十四日在美国乔治亚州律师代表会议上说：“受过优良的战斗训练的美国士兵是世界上最有威力的制造毁灭的机器。”今年竞选中他又说要用武力“解放”由东欧洲到中国，他是一个赤口獠牙的战争贩子。但是，艾森豪威尔为了骗取选票，最后却大念“和平”符咒，说他如果当选，将立即亲自到朝鲜去一趟，以尽速结束战争。这完全是欺骗。现在他还没有到朝鲜去，他却为了华尔街垄断资本家军事订货的利润的利益，声明支持杜鲁门强迫扣留中朝战俘的政策，破坏朝鲜停战谈判，继续侵朝战争。很显然地，艾森豪威尔如果到朝鲜去，他决不是去结束战争，而是“加强”和扩大战争。美国人民是越来越甚地受着欺骗，战争叫嚣者嘴里的“和平”符咒，是绝对骗人的。
    美国人民到了耳聪目明的时候了，你们应该听透看穿一切虚伪欺骗的宣传，与全世界爱好和平的人民一道，制止“冷战”，制止战争宣传，反对战争，拯救和平。这是全世界善良男女的利益，也正是美国人民的利益。
    我谨以一个中国新闻工作者的身分，敬祝即将在维也纳举行的世界人民和平大会获得伟大胜利；向全世界公正善良的舆论呼吁：制止“冷战”，制止战争宣传！
