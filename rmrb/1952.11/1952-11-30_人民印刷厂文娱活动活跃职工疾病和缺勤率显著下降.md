To the Editor:
    After solving the problems of long working hours, excessive meetings, and cadres holding multiple positions in our Beijing People's Printing Factory in October this year, we have not only greatly enhanced the enthusiasm of employees for production and learning, and improved work efficiency, but also enlivened after-work cultural and recreational activities, leading to a significant decrease in the number of sick employees and the absenteeism rate.

    In the past, day-shift workers in our factory often had meetings before work, during lunch while eating, and an hour of study after work, followed by group meetings. Night-shift workers started work at 8:00 PM, but they had to come to the factory as early as 3:00 PM to wait for meetings, even if there was nothing specific to discuss. Meetings on Sundays were even more common. Once a meeting started, people would talk endlessly about everything, solving few problems but dragging on for a long time. This caused employees to become excessively tired, damaged their health, affected their studies, and even led to accidents. Night-shift worker Gong Wuzhang, for example, was injured when his hand was crushed by a machine after dozing off due to excessive meetings and lack of sleep, requiring over a month of recovery. Leading machine operator Wang Zhenbang held seven positions concurrently, spending most of his day away from his machine attending meetings. With no one watching the machine, accidents frequently occurred. His colleagues were very dissatisfied with this. Wang Zhenbang thought, "They have suffered on my behalf, and production still can't keep up with others. As a Party member and a cadre, I should make a self-criticism." He made self-criticisms at every group meeting, but this didn't solve the problem; he still had to leave his machine to attend meetings. Unable to complete his work and failing to improve production, he was extremely distressed.

    Now, the situation is quite different. Employees have plenty of time to rest, and everyone actively and happily participates in cultural and recreational activities. In the past, there were always few people on the sports field; now, it feels like the sports field is not big enough. In the past, no one did morning exercises; now, there are over three hundred participants. In the past, the library was deserted; now, the number of people borrowing books has increased by fifty percent. Clubs, dance troupes, choirs, drama groups, Peking opera groups, literary groups, and art groups have all become active, with an average increase of about eighty percent in membership. Additionally, a new martial arts group has been established. As a result, employee illness and absenteeism rates have significantly decreased. According to statistics from the clinic: the number of outpatients in October decreased by 22.4% compared to September, and the average number for the first half of November is even lower than the average number for the half-month of October. In September, the factory-wide absenteeism rate was around 6%; now, absentees account for only 2.4%.

### 人民印刷厂文娱活动活跃职工疾病和缺勤率显著下降

    人民印刷厂文娱活动活跃职工疾病和缺勤率显著下降
    编辑同志：我们北京人民印刷厂在今年十月间解决了职工业余活动时间长，会议多，干部兼职多的问题后，不仅大大提高了职工生产和学习的热情，提高了工作效率，而且使业余文化娱乐活动活跃起来了，职工疾病人数和缺勤率显著下降。
    过去，我们厂里的白班工人上班前经常要开会，中午一边吃饭一边开会，下班后还有一点钟学习，学习完了还要开小组会。夜班工人是下午八点上班，有事没事也得在下午三点钟来厂等着开会；甚至第二天下了班还有会。星期日开会更是常事。一开起会来，就无边无沿的说东道西，问题解决的不多，时间却拖的很长，这就使职工过度疲劳，损害了职工身体的健康，影响了学习，甚至容易发生事故。夜班工友宫武章就是因为开会多，睡眠不足，有一次在机器上打了盹，被机器把手压伤了，休养了一个多月才好。领机工人王振邦，身兼七职，一天的大部分时间是离开机器去开会。机器没人看管，总出事故。同班工人对此非常不满。王振邦想：“他们替我受了累，生产还是赶不上别人。我是党员又是干部，应该检讨。”他每次在小组会上都作检讨；但这并不能解决问题，他还是不得不因为开会而离开机器。工作做不成，生产搞不好，他苦恼极了。
    现在的情况可就大不一样了。职工们有了充分的休息时间，大家都积极愉快地参加了文化娱乐活动。过去运动场里总是没有几个人；现在已经感到运动场不够用了。过去早晨没人上操；现在有了三百多人。过去图书馆是冷落人稀；现在借书的人增加了百分之五十。俱乐部、舞蹈、合唱团、话剧组、京剧组、文艺组、美术组都活跃起来了，平均增加了百分之八十左右的人数；并且新成立了国术组。因此职工疾病和缺勤率显著下降。据医务所统计：十月份门诊人数比九月减少了百分之二十二点四，十一月上半月比十月份的半月平均数字更降低了。九月份全厂缺勤是百分之六左右，现在缺勤者仅占百分之二点四。    郭殿魁
