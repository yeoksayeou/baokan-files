    Resolutely Support the Soviet Proposal

    The Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly has launched a fierce struggle over the Korean issue. This struggle concerns the future of the Korean War and peace, as well as the future of the United Nations itself. That is to say, will the United Nations, in accordance with the wishes of hundreds of millions of people, promote the realization of the Korean armistice on a fair and reasonable basis, and restore itself to the path of being an instrument for maintaining international peace and security? Or will it continue to be a war tool for a handful of American monopoly capitalists, following their dictates to expand and perpetuate the Korean War, and thus bury itself completely? This is the nature of the question facing the United Nations.

    The Korean issue, especially the issue of immediately achieving a Korean armistice, is an extremely important and urgent issue. This is because the bloody tragedy in Korea, which has been going on for more than twenty-eight months, not only continues at present, but also, due to the United States unilaterally interrupting the Korean armistice negotiations before the United Nations General Assembly convened, the Korean people and the people of all countries are facing the danger of the war being prolonged and expanded. This has aroused concern and unease among the people of all countries, and they firmly demand an immediate end to the Korean War and a swift resolution of the Korean issue through peaceful means. The resolutions on the Korean issue and the letter to the United Nations made by the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, which represents the will of the people of the Asian and Pacific regions, vividly reflect this peaceful will of the people of all countries. Therefore, the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly, from the very beginning, under the firm demands of the Soviet Union, Poland, and other countries that sincerely hope to end the bloody tragedy in Korea as soon as possible, was forced to consider the Korean issue first.

    In order to achieve peace in Korea, the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, has submitted a proposal to the United Nations General Assembly, requesting the establishment of a committee for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, with the participation of all directly related parties and other countries—including countries that have not participated in the Korean War—to resolve the Korean issue in the spirit of Koreans unifying Korea themselves under the supervision of the above-mentioned committee. Poland also proposed the immediate cessation of military actions and a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    The Soviet proposal is the only way to achieve a Korean armistice, fundamentally resolve the Korean War, and achieve peace. At the same time, the Polish proposal, supported by the Soviet Union and other countries, also proposes that military action in Korea should be stopped immediately, all prisoners of war should be repatriated according to international rules, and all foreign troops, including the Chinese People's Volunteers, should be withdrawn from Korea within two or three months. These are all necessary conditions for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    Obviously, the only thing currently hindering the realization of a Korean armistice is the unreasonable demand insisted upon by the United States to forcibly detain prisoners of war. This demand completely violates all international conventions and international covenants, and also violates the provisions of the draft Korean Armistice Agreement. It is not only unacceptable to our side, but also resolutely opposed by all of righteous humanity. The issue of prisoner of war repatriation can only be reasonably resolved by repatriating all prisoners of war in accordance with the provisions of the 1949 Geneva Convention, allowing them to return home to live peaceful lives. Any unreasonable demand that violates these international rules and implements the forced detention of prisoners of war can only hinder the prisoners' eager hope of returning home and hinder the realization of the Korean armistice that the people of the world are eagerly awaiting. At the same time, if the Korean armistice is not to be a continuation of division and war, it is necessary to withdraw all foreign troops from Korea and create a peaceful environment for the Korean people so that they can achieve peace and unification in Korea under the supervision of the committee proposed by the Soviet Union. Otherwise, the armistice would only be an interlude in the war, not the realization of peace in Korea, and not a thorough resolution of the Korean issue.

    The issue is already very clear, and there is only one path: the United Nations can only escape the manipulation of the United States on the Korean issue and make some contribution to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue by accepting the proposals of the Soviet Union and Poland.

    However, this path has been brazenly obstructed and sabotaged by the United States. The means of sabotage by the United States are: First, manipulating its voting machine in the United Nations to unreasonably refuse the representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to attend the United Nations General Assembly and participate in the discussion of the Korean issue. This is obviously to create a one-sided situation favorable to the United States in the discussion; this one-sided discussion can never be fair in any sense. Second, the United States used the same methods as above to make incorrect decisions in the United Nations Political Committee, delaying the discussion of the Polish proposal. Third, and most brazenly, the United States and some countries participating in the aggression against Korea put forward a proposal requesting the United Nations to "support" the unreasonable demands of the United States in the Korean armistice negotiations. This is completely a proposal by the United States to further use the United Nations as a tool for expanding its war of aggression.

    This proposal by the United States is based on lies and the destruction of international conventions. U.S. Secretary of State Acheson delivered a speech at the United Nations Political Committee on October 24, attempting to portray the U.S. record of delaying and sabotaging the Korean negotiations as a record of the U.S. "doing everything possible to seek peace in Korea," and the U.S.'s unreasonable demand to screen prisoners of war with massacres and attempt to forcibly detain them as "humanitarian principles" followed by the U.S. This is the old trick of the U.S. government, and this kind of lie cannot stand the test of facts. In his speech to the United Nations Political Committee on October 29, Vyshinsky presented a large amount of irrefutable facts, thoroughly exposing Acheson's lies. From Vyshinsky's speech, people can clearly see that due to the firm efforts of the Korean and Chinese sides, many excuses of the U.S. side were removed, and all 63 clauses of the draft Korean Armistice Agreement were fully agreed upon. Even so, the U.S. side finally made excuses on the issue of prisoners of war and unilaterally suspended the armistice negotiations on October 8. The bloody massacres of prisoners of war continuously manufactured by the U.S. side in Geoje Island, Jeju Island, and other prisoner of war camps on the Korean mainland have long proven the U.S. crime of forcibly screening prisoners of war and the assertion of forced detention of prisoners of war is extremely inhuman, and there is no "humanitarian principle" to speak of. The fact that the U.S. abused and massacred prisoners of war has not only been admitted by former U.S. prisoner of war camp commander Colson, but also by the so-called International Committee of the Red Cross's report on the Geoje Island incident of February 18. Although the International Committee of the Red Cross is only a convenient tool for the United States, and its report was only forced to be presented in order to embellish its so-called fair face in order to carry out deception more effectively, the U.S. side does not dare to submit this report of the International Committee of the Red Cross to the United Nations General Assembly, just as it does not dare to make the documents of the Korean armistice negotiations public to the United Nations General Assembly. This is because the United States fears facing the iron facts.

    Vyshinsky's just and sharp speech at the United Nations has completely exposed Acheson and other American officials as nothing more than the most vile and shameless liars; they do not hesitate to openly distort the facts, cover up the truth of the U.S. government's crimes, and dress themselves up as envoys of "humanity" in order to deceive the people.

    Acheson and his ilk fabricated an excuse for the unreasonable U.S. assertion of forced detention of prisoners of war, which is: "No forcible repatriation by force." In this way, they thought they could portray the U.S. attempt to forcibly detain prisoners of war as out of respect for the "free will" of the prisoners of war and in accordance with the spirit of the Geneva Prisoner of War Convention. This shameless statement is completely unfounded in law. People know that prisoners of war are forcibly detained by the detaining party and controlled by the detaining party's force. Therefore, there is only the issue of prisoners of war escaping the detaining party's force, and there is no issue of "forcible repatriation by force" at all. Therefore, any international agreement on the issue of prisoners of war stipulates that all prisoners of war must be repatriated. At the same time, in order to prevent the detaining party from refusing to repatriate prisoners of war under the guise of prisoners of war, Article 7 of the Geneva Convention stipulates: "In no circumstances may a prisoner of war renounce in part or in entirety the rights secured to him by the present Convention..." At the 1949 Geneva International Conference, even U.S. representative General Parker opposed recognizing proposals with the so-called meaning of non-forcible repatriation. From this, it can be seen that Acheson and his ilk's nonsense about "no forcible repatriation by force" is completely illegal and completely self-contradictory.

    The U.S.'s purpose in interrupting the armistice negotiations by using the failure to reach an agreement on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation as an excuse and what it is doing in the United Nations is to cut off the prospect of a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue in order to expand the war of aggression against Korea. Acheson has openly stated at the United Nations General Assembly that the United States is determined to perpetuate the Korean War, and another U.S. diplomat, Assistant Secretary of State Hickson, shouted even more blatantly in a speech delivered on October 19: "We intend to strive as much as possible at the United Nations General Assembly to make those member states that have not yet assumed their responsibilities in Korea assume their responsibilities. There should be more troops in Korea now who can carry out the battle to the necessary time." This completely exposes the U.S. ambition to further drag United Nations member states into the Korean War.

    The peace-loving people of the world resolutely oppose the U.S. plot to use the United Nations to expand the war of aggression against Korea; the call for the realization of a Korean armistice and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue has resounded throughout the world. If the United States disregards the peaceful wishes of the people of all countries and continues to adhere to its policy of aggression, it will inevitably encounter even stronger opposition and fail completely.

    We Chinese people resolutely support the Soviet Union and Poland's proposals for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue; the U.S. attempt to expand the Korean War absolutely cannot scare us; we will continue to firmly strive to repatriate all prisoners of war on the principles of the Geneva Convention in order to realize a Korean armistice and for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The people of the whole world are with us, justice belongs to us, and victory is bound to be ours.

### 坚决拥护苏联的建议

    坚决拥护苏联的建议
    七届联合国大会已在朝鲜问题上展开了激烈的斗争。这个斗争关系着朝鲜战争与和平的前途，也关系着联合国本身的前途。这也就是说，联合国究竟是将按照着亿万人民的愿望，在公平合理的基础上促使朝鲜停战实现，而使它自己恢复到作为维护国际和平与安全的工具的道路上去呢，还是继续作为一小撮美国独占资本家的战争工具，并仰承他们的意旨，使朝鲜战争扩大和持久化，而使它自己被彻底埋葬掉呢？这就是摆在联合国面前的问题的性质。
    朝鲜问题，尤其是立即实现朝鲜停战的问题，是一个极端重要，也是极端急迫的问题。这是因为已经进行了二十八个多月的朝鲜流血惨剧不仅目前还在继续，而且由于美国在联合国大会开会之前片面中断了朝鲜停战谈判，而使朝鲜人民和世界各国人民面对着战争延长和扩大的危险。这引起了各国人民的忧虑和不安，并坚决要求立即结束朝鲜战争，迅速以和平方法解决朝鲜问题。代表着亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民意志的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议所作出的关于朝鲜问题的决议和致联合国书，就极为生动地反映了各国人民的这种和平意志。因此，七届联合国大会从一开始，就不得不在苏联、波兰以及真诚希望早日结束朝鲜流血惨剧的其它国家的坚决主张之下，被迫首先考虑朝鲜问题。
    为了实现朝鲜的和平，苏联代表团团长维辛斯基已向联合国大会提出一个建议，要求设立和平解决朝鲜问题委员会由直接有关的各方以及其他国家——包括没有参加朝鲜战争的国家——参加，本着由朝鲜人自己在上述委员会的监督下统一朝鲜的精神来解决朝鲜问题。波兰也提出了立即停止军事行动，和平解决朝鲜问题的建议。
    苏联的建议是实现朝鲜停战，从根本上解决朝鲜战争与实现和平的唯一道路。同时为苏联等国所支持的波兰建议并主张：立刻停止在朝鲜的军事行动，根据国际规则遣返所有战俘；所有外国军队，包括中国人民志愿军在内，在两、三个月内一律撤出朝鲜。这都是和平解决朝鲜问题的必要条件。
    显然地，目前阻碍着实现朝鲜停战的只有美国所坚持的强迫扣留战俘的无理主张。这种主张完全违反了一切国际惯例和国际公约，并且也违反了朝鲜停战协定草案条款的规定，它不仅不能为我方所接受，而且也是全体正义人类所坚决反对的。战俘遣返问题只有按照一九四九年日内瓦公约的规定，将全部战俘遣返，使他们都能回家过和平生活，才能得到合理的解决；而任何违反这种国际规则，实行强迫扣留战俘的无理主张，都只能阻挠战俘对遣返回家的殷切盼望，阻挠全世界人民所迫切期待的朝鲜停战的实现。同时，朝鲜的停战如果不是分裂和战争状态的继续，就必须使一切外国军队都撤出朝鲜，为朝鲜人民创造一个和平的环境，以便他们能够在苏联建议的委员会的监督下，实现朝鲜的和平与统一。否则，停战就只能是战争的间歇，而不是朝鲜和平的实现，不是朝鲜问题的彻底解决。
    问题已经非常明白，道路只有一条，那就是：联合国只有接受苏联和波兰的建议，才能在朝鲜问题上脱离美国的操纵，并对朝鲜问题的和平解决有所作为。
    但是，这条道路却遭到美国的无耻阻挠和破坏。美国的破坏手段是：第一，操纵它在联合国中的表决机器，无理地拒绝朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表出席联合国大会，参与朝鲜问题的讨论。这显然是为了要在讨论中造成片面的、有利于美国的情势；这种片面的讨论在任何意义上都不可能是公平的。第二，美国利用与上述同样的手法，在联合国政治委员会中作出不正确的决定，拖延对波兰建议的讨论。第三，主要的也是最无耻的，就是由美国和一些参加侵朝战争的国家提出了一个要求联合国为美国在朝鲜停战谈判中的无理主张“撑腰”的建议。这完全是美国企图进一步利用联合国作为扩大侵略战争的工具的建议。
    美国的这个建议是建立在谎言与破坏国际公约的基础上的。美国国务卿艾奇逊于十月二十四日在联合国政治委员会上发表了一篇演说，力图把美国拖延和破坏朝鲜谈判的纪录说成是美国“竭尽所能来求得朝鲜和平”的纪录，把美国以屠杀暴行甄别战俘并企图实行强迫扣留他们的无理主张说成是美国所遵循的“人道原则”。这是美国政府的老一套谎言，这种谎言是经不起事实的对证的。维辛斯基十月二十九日在联合国政治委员会所发表的演说中，提出了大量的、不可辩驳的事实，彻底揭穿了艾奇逊的谎言。从维辛斯基的演说中，人们可以清楚地看出：由于朝中方面的坚定努力，解除了美方的许多藉口，而使朝鲜停战协定草案六十三项条款完全获得协议。虽然如此，美方最后却在遣俘问题上制造藉口，而于十月八日片面中止了停战谈判。美方在巨济岛、济州岛和朝鲜大陆其他战俘营里所连续制造的屠杀战俘的血腥惨案，早已证明了美方强迫甄别战俘的罪行和强迫扣留战俘的主张，是极端惨无人道的，那里还谈得上什么“人道原则”呢？美方虐待和惨杀战俘的事实不仅早已为美国前战俘营长官柯尔生所承认，并且也早已为所谓红十字国际委员会关于二月十八日的巨济岛事件的报告所证实了。虽然红十字国际委员会只是美国的如意工具，它的报告不过是被迫提出为了粉饰所谓公正面目以便更有效地进行欺骗的，然而美方却不敢将红十字国际委员会的这个报告向联合国大会提出，正如它不敢将朝鲜停战谈判的文件向联合国大会公开一样，这都是由于美国惧怕面对铁的事实。
    维辛斯基在联合国的正义的、锋利的发言，已完全揭露了艾奇逊之流的美国官员们只不过是最下流无耻的骗子；他们竟不惜公开歪曲事实，掩盖美国政府犯罪的真相，并把他们自己装扮成维护“人道”的使者，以图欺骗人民。
    艾奇逊之流更为美国强迫扣留战俘的无理主张，捏造了一个藉口，那就是：“不以武力强迫遣返”。这样，他们以为就可以把美国强迫扣留战俘的图谋，说成是出于尊重战俘的“自由意志”，并且是符合于日内瓦战俘公约的精神的。这种无耻的说法是完全没有法律根据的。人们知道，战俘是由收容一方以武力强迫拘留的并为收容一方的武力所控制的，因而对于战俘只有脱离收容一方的武力控制的问题，而根本不可能有什么“武力强迫遣返”的问题。因此，任何有关战俘问题的国际协定都规定了战俘必须全部遣返。同时，为了防止拘留方面假冒战俘的名义拒绝遣返战俘，日内瓦公约第七条规定：“在任何情况下战俘不得放弃本公约……所赋予彼等权利之一部或全部。”在一九四九年日内瓦国际会议上，甚至美国代表帕克将军也曾反对承认带有所谓不强迫遣返意义的建议。由此可见，艾奇逊之流的“不得以武力强迫遣返”的胡说，是完全非法并且是完全自相矛盾的。
    美国藉口战俘遣返问题不能取得协议而中断停战谈判及其在联合国的所作所为，其目的是在于断绝和平解决朝鲜问题的前途，以扩大侵朝战争。艾奇逊在联合国大会上已公开表示美国决心使朝鲜战争持久化，而另一个美国外交官、助理国务卿希克逊在十月十九日所发表的演说中更公然喊叫：“我们打算在联合国大会上尽量争取那些还没有负起它们在朝鲜的责任的会员国负起责任。在朝鲜现在应该有更多的军队，能够随时把战斗进行到必要的时间。”这就完全暴露了美国企图将联合国会员国进一步拖入朝鲜战争的野心。
    世界各国爱好和平的人民坚决反对美国利用联合国扩大侵朝战争的阴谋；要求实现朝鲜停战与和平解决朝鲜问题的呼声，已响彻了全世界。美国如果不顾各国人民的和平意愿而继续坚持其侵略战争政策的话，它必然要遭受到更为强大的反对，并完全失败下去。
    我们中国人民坚决拥护苏联和波兰关于和平解决朝鲜问题的建议；美国企图扩大朝鲜战争的阴谋绝对吓不倒我们；我们将继续坚定地为在日内瓦公约的原则上遣返全部战俘，以实现朝鲜停战并为和平解决朝鲜问题而继续努力。全世界人民和我们在一道，正义属于我们，胜利也必然是我们的。
