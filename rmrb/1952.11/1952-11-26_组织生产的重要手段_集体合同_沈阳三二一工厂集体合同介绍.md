    An Important Means of Organizing Production - The Collective Contract
    - Introduction to the Collective Contract of Shenyang 321 Factory
    By Our Reporter Gu Weijin
    The collective contract is an important means of organizing production. Many industrial and mining enterprises in the Northeast region are signing collective contracts. However, some industrial and mining enterprises still lack sufficient understanding of the significance of signing collective contracts: they believe that collective contracts are "too complicated" and that their own industrial and mining enterprises are in "poor condition" and do not need to sign them; others, although they have signed collective contracts, lack the working methods of relying on and mobilizing the masses, so the contracts become mere formalities and cannot be sustained. The experience of Shenyang 321 Factory in signing collective contracts proves that collective contracts do not have to wait until all conditions are met before they can be signed. As long as industrial and mining enterprises have undergone preliminary democratic reforms and workers have a preliminary class consciousness, they can sign collective contracts, and then change the various unfavorable conditions of the industrial and mining enterprises; as long as they rely on the masses when signing collective contracts and have the masses as their foundation, they can certainly be sustained. The following is the process of the factory signing the collective contract.
    I. Clearly Recognizing the Significance
    and Role of Collective Contracts
    As early as 1950, the leaders of Shenyang 321 Factory saw that some factories in the Soviet Union and Dalian were signing collective contracts, so they seriously studied the role of collective contracts and gradually realized that in socialist state-owned industrial and mining enterprises, the joint signing of collective contracts by the administrative and trade union departments can organically organize the forces of all aspects of the factory, improve enterprise management, improve the material and cultural life of employees, and improve the political awareness and production enthusiasm of employees. After the leading cadres of the party, administration, trade union, and youth league at the factory level had a unified understanding of this issue, under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, combined with relevant collective contract documents, they educated the workshop cadres, group leaders, and employees at all levels, criticized and corrected the erroneous understanding of some cadres who believed that "it doesn't matter whether or not to engage in collective contracts, just work according to the plan," and also criticized and corrected the erroneous understanding of some workers who believed that "whether or not to sign a collective contract, we still have to work eight hours, and we can't work less."
    II. Draft a Contract and Mobilize the Masses
    for Discussion
    When signing a collective contract, the first step is to draft a contract and fully mobilize the masses to discuss it. The draft collective contract is formulated by the administration and the trade union based on the current central task and the specific conditions of the factory. It clearly puts forward the central issues or key issues that need to be resolved, and puts forward various planned targets and main practices. But these are all principles and must be discussed by the masses to make them specific. For example, what methods should be used to complete the plan, how to improve the plan, and how to find the key problems of the department. In this way, there is a reliable guarantee for the realization of the contract. The discussion of the draft contract for the second quarter of this year is a good example. The central requirement of the second quarter contract is to set out an annual plan for increasing production and practicing economy. The planned targets are to increase production and save 40,000 tons of grain, overproduce by 6%, reduce costs by 4%, improve the capacity of machinery and equipment, and save raw materials. After discussion by employees, this draft contract became specific and practical. For example, the plan of the No. 2 workshop, based on the draft contract, is: (1) In terms of quality: the factory proposed a quality quota of 99.6% to the No. 2 workshop, but the No. 2 workshop broke through the quota last quarter and reached 99.67%, and the scrap rate has been reduced to below 0.4%; if we continue to improve the technology, the scrap rate can be reduced to 0.17%. Therefore, this year's quality target should be to strive to reach 99.77%. (2) In terms of output: the output has exceeded the factory's quota by 4.2% last quarter, and we will continue to find tricks to improve the utilization rate of machinery and equipment, so this year's output should be increased by another 6%. (3) In terms of cost: the factory has stipulated a cost reduction of 2.48%, but the current consumption of raw materials is still high, and the consumption of some materials can be reduced, and some materials can also use substitutes. At the same time, we have found a larger valuable trick, so this year we will strive to reduce costs by 8%. In addition, we have also formulated a plan for promoting advanced experience and a plan for technical organization measures.
    After all the workshops discussed and made advanced plans, the leadership revised the draft contract again: the original draft contract planned to overproduce by 6%, which was changed to 11%; the original plan to reduce costs by 4% was changed to 4.63%; the original plan to increase production and save 40,000 tons of grain was changed to 52,000 tons.
    In each draft collective contract, collective welfare undertakings for employees are also included, which must also be discussed by employees. When drafting the contract, the leadership organizes staff from security, health, welfare, and labor protection departments to conduct extensive and in-depth understanding of the welfare and production safety issues that employees urgently need to solve by using employee representative meetings, family member forums, and visits to employees. At the same time, the factory director's fund's income and expenditure balance is announced, and it is planned how to use it reasonably. After the above measures, after drafting the contract, fully mobilize employees to discuss it. According to the factory director's fund and the legitimate demands of employees, appropriately revise the draft contract. For example, in the second quarter draft contract this year, after discussion by employees, production and savings of 52,000 tons of grain can be achieved, and the factory director's fund can obtain about 2 billion yuan. According to the requirements of employees, the leadership added two Soviet-made GAZ public buses to the original draft contract
    (for pregnant women, female employees with children, elderly workers, sanatorium staff, etc. to commute to and from work), and a chronic disease sanatorium with a capacity of 60 beds.
    After the draft contract is discussed by employees, the role of combining leadership intentions with the masses is fully utilized, educating every employee and making everyone aware of the relationship between the collective contract and the individual.
    III. Signing Group Patriotic Pacts and Contact
    Contracts to Ensure the Implementation of Collective Contracts
    After the draft collective contract is solemnly signed by the administrative and trade union representatives of all employees, it becomes a formal contract (after being approved by the administration, the higher-level trade union, and the government's labor bureau before signing). The most effective way to ensure the realization of the contract is to sign a group patriotic pact and a contact contract.
    The group patriotic pact is an organizational form that organizes all the forces of a group to ensure the completion of the group's plan. It sets out a strict inspection system and reward and punishment system. After each department puts the plans discussed according to the draft contract into the group patriotic pact, everyone concentrates on ensuring its completion. For example, the plan of Bi Yulan's group is to require the entire group to generally increase output, and she adopts the method of advanced driving backward to solve this problem. She once created advanced experience, and the output reached 520 kilograms, but the average output of the whole group was only 296 kilograms; she patiently taught her advanced experience to everyone, and as a result, the average output of the whole group reached 408 kilograms. The plan of the Jiudao group is to require reducing defective products and improving quality. Everyone humbly learns advanced experience, improves technology, finds out the causes of defective products, and comes up with solutions to overcome them, so that the number of defective products in the whole group is reduced from more than 5,000 per month to more than 200. The plan of Zhao Enbo's group is to require improving technology and improving tools. Everyone organizes a technical research association and asks veteran workers to explain technical problems. As a result, workers generally improve their technology and improve 17 kinds of sample tools.
    However, the group patriotic pact can only solve the problems within the group. Each department must cooperate with each other in important links, which requires signing a contact contract. For example, both the No. 2 workshop and the No. 5 workshop need to ensure each other's quality in order to complete their own plans, so they sign a contact contract stipulating that the other party will not accept products with poor quality, which arouses everyone's attention to quality. The No. 2 workshop sends good products to the No. 5 workshop, and the product quality of the No. 5 workshop is also guaranteed. For example, the material management department and the direct production workshop both feel that in order to complete their own plans, one party must receive materials in a planned manner according to needs, and the other party must supply materials in a timely manner. According to this requirement, both parties sign a contact contract to ensure each other, and both parties complete their own plans.
    Each department signs a group patriotic pact and a contact contract to ensure that they complete their own plans, which is to complete the entire plan, which is the realization of the collective contract.
    IV. Establishing an Inspection System
    Establishing an inspection system and solving problems in a timely manner is an important link to ensure the implementation of the contract. To this end, the factory established a collective contract inspection committee (now changed to joint inspection by people from the party, government, trade union, and youth league systems) to conduct regular and irregular inspections, solving many problems in the implementation of the contract. For example, some departments do not strictly implement the contract, but are very strict with others (even exceeding the inspection specifications), causing unnecessary rework and waste to the other party; some departments have signed a contract with others, but have not communicated it well to the employees, so that the employees do not know what to guarantee; some departments encounter difficulties in the implementation of the contract and cannot realize the contract on time... The inspection team discovers these problems and immediately cooperates with the relevant departments to conduct education, point out the correct attitude that should be taken in the implementation of the contract, and mobilize employees to study ways to realize the contract. In addition, in order to inspect the contract more widely and deeply, we also mobilize the masses to conduct self-inspection and mutual inspection. After a certain period of time, the leadership convenes a meeting of cadres above the workshop level to systematically point out the deviations and shortcomings in the implementation of the contract, organize discussions, and study ways to improve, so that the contract can be gradually implemented.
    V. Change the Face of Enterprise Management and Exceed
    Production Tasks
    Shenyang 321 Factory has signed collective contracts according to the above practices, and has insisted on the contract since May 1950, which has played a great role in improving enterprise management and improving production.
    Before the signing of the collective contract, the enterprise management of the factory was very poor. In addition to the initial democratic reforms, employees began to improve their class consciousness, but the old management system had not been well changed, and the new management system was very unsound, forming a situation where the management department could not keep up with the needs of production, affecting the development of production. Since the signing of the collective contract, this situation has been completely changed.
    The first is to achieve production balance and implement the economic accounting system. The collective contract organizes all employees and departments through group patriotic pacts and contact contracts to cooperate and ensure each other to complete their own production plans (which is to complete the entire production plan). This organized and planned production enables production to achieve balanced development. On this basis, quota management is strengthened. After that, cost management was strengthened. Departmental cost accounting was implemented, and workshops and groups also implemented cost management. Now, the "personal accumulation manual" has been promoted, and it is developing towards individual economic accounting. In this way, costs can be controlled in advance, and costs can be analyzed afterward. Secondly, in order to ensure the realization of the contract, employees sign master-apprentice contracts, organize technical learning, improve their technical level, revise the old technical operation regulations, and formulate technical quality responsibility systems and technical safety systems. Third, welfare facilities have been strengthened. In the past, the welfare facilities were only bathhouses and cooperatives. Now, after signing collective contracts for two years, 6 to 7 billion yuan has been taken out of the factory director's fund to run many collective welfare undertakings. For example, part-time sanatoriums, chronic disease sanatoriums, nurseries, children's schools, libraries, cinemas, broadcasting stations, etc. have been established, solving the ventilation equipment problems in the workshops. Employees who work in processes that are harmful to their health can enjoy health foods such as milk and eggs every day. On this basis, with the selfless labor of all employees, the production tasks are comprehensively exceeded every year. The production task in 1950 was doubled compared to 1949, but the task was exceeded by 23%. The task in 1951 was increased by 87% compared to 1950, but the task was still exceeded by 8%. Daily output has quadrupled compared to the puppet Manchukuo and Kuomintang periods. In terms of quality, it increased by 13.5% in 1950 and 7% in 1951. The rate of good products increased from 40% during the puppet Manchukuo and Kuomintang periods to 96.5%. In terms of cost, the cost in 1950 was 32% lower than the planned cost, the cost in 1951 was 15% lower than the planned cost, and the cost in the first half of this year was 5.64% lower than the planned cost. The production cycle has been shortened from 85 days to 44 days.

    组织生产的重要手段——集体合同
    ——沈阳三二一工厂集体合同介绍
    本报记者  古维进
    集体合同是组织生产的重要手段。东北区有许多工矿企业正在签订集体合同。但是尚有一部分工矿企业对于签订集体合同认识不足：认为集体合同“太复杂”，自己的工矿企业“条件不好”，用不着签订；另有一部分工矿企业虽然签订了集体合同，但是缺乏依靠群众、发动群众的工作方法，合同流于形式，不能坚持下去。沈阳三二一工厂签订集体合同的经验证明，集体合同不是必须等待各种条件具备之后才能签订的，只要工矿企业经过初步民主改革，工人有了初步的阶级觉悟，就可以签订集体合同，进而改变工矿企业的各种不好的条件；签订集体合同时只要依靠群众，有群众作基础，一定可以坚持下去。下面是该厂签订集体合同的经过。
    一、明确认识集体合同的意义
    和作用
    沈阳三二一工厂领导方面早在一九五○年看见苏联和大连一些工厂签订集体合同，就认真研究集体合同的作用，逐渐明确地认识了在社会主义性质的国营工矿企业里，由行政和工会方面共同签订集体合同，可以把全厂各方面的力量有机地组织起来，改进企业管理，改善职工的物质、文化生活，提高职工的政治觉悟和生产热情。当厂一级的党、行政、工会、青年团的领导干部对这一问题有了统一的认识之后，在党委统一领导下，结合有关集体合同的文件，向车间干部、小组长及职工群众逐级进行教育，批判和纠正了某些干部认为“搞不搞集体合同没有关系，按计划干就行了”的错误认识，也批判和纠正了一些工人认为“订不订集体合同也要干八小时，少干一点也不行”的错误认识。
    二、拟出合同草案，发动群众
    讨论
    签订集体合同时，首先是拟出合同草案，充分发动群众讨论。集体合同草案是行政和工会根据当前的中心任务和本厂的具体情况拟订出来的，它明确提出当前需要解决的中心问题或关键问题，提出各项计划指标和主要作法等。但这些都是原则性的，必须发动群众讨论，把它具体化，例如用什么办法完成计划，怎样提高计划，怎样找出本部门的关键问题等。这样，实现合同才有可靠的保证。今年讨论第二季度合同草案就是很好的例子。第二季度合同的中心要求是订出全年的增产节约计划，计划的指标是增产节约粮食四万吨，超额生产百分之六，降低成本百分之四，提高机器设备能力，节约原材料等。这个合同草案经过职工讨论，就变得具体、切实了。例如二车间根据合同草案讨论出本车间的计划是：（一）在质量方面：厂部向二车间提出质量定额为百分之九十九点六，但二车间上季已突破定额，达到百分之九十九点六七，废品率已降低到百分之零点四以下；大家如再继续改进技术，废品率可降低到百分之零点一七。因此今年的质量指标要争取达到百分之九十九点七七。（二）在产量方面：上季已超过厂部的定额百分之四点二，今后继续找窍门，机器设备运用率还可以提高，因此今年的产量要再提高百分之六。（三）在成本方面：厂部曾规定降低成本百分之二点四八，但目前的原料用量仍高，有的材料消耗量可以减少，有的材料还可以使用代用品，同时已经找出较大的有价值的窍门，因此今年要争取降低成本百分之八。另外还订出推广先进经验的计划和技术组织措施计划等。
    各车间都经过讨论订出了先进的计划以后，领导方面又修改了合同草案：原合同草案计划超额生产百分之六，改为百分之十一；原计划降低成本百分之四，改为百分之四点六三；原计划增产节约四万吨粮食，改为五万二千吨。
    在每次的集体合同草案里，也包括职工的集体福利事业，这也必须发动职工讨论。在拟订合同草案时，领导方面就组织保安、卫生、福利、劳保等有关部门的工作人员，采用职工代表会、家属座谈会及访问职工等方式，广泛地、深入地了解职工目前所迫切需要解决的福利及生产安全问题，同时公布厂长基金收支结存情况，酝酿如何合理使用。经过以上措施，拟出合同草案后，充分发动职工讨论。根据厂长基金的情况，及职工的正当要求，适当修改合同草案。例如今年第二季度的合同草案，经过职工讨论，可以增产节约粮食五万二千吨，厂长基金大约能得二十亿元，领导方面根据职工的要求，在原合同草案里增添了两辆苏联大吉士公共汽车
    （供孕妇、带小孩的女职工、老年工人、休养员等上下班之用），和能容六十个床位的慢性病疗养所
    一所。
    合同草案经过职工讨论，充分发挥领导意图与群众结合的作用，教育了每个职工，使大家知道了集体合同和个人的关系。
    三、签订小组爱国公约和联系
    合同，保证集体合同的实现
    集体合同草案经过行政和工会代表全体职工隆重签字之后，便是正式合同（签字前经过行政与上级工会及政府劳动局批准）。保证合同实现的最有效办法，就是签订小组爱国公约和联系合同。
    小组爱国公约是把一个组的所有力量组织起来保证完成小组计划的组织形式。它定出严格的检查制度与奖惩制度。各部门根据合同草案把讨论出来的计划订到小组爱国公约中后，大家就集中力量保证把它完成。例如毕玉兰小组的计划是要求全组普遍提高产量，她就采取先进带动落后的办法解决这个问题。她曾经创造先进经验，产量达到五二○公斤，但是全组的平均产量只有二九六公斤；她就把自己的先进经验耐心地教给大家，结果全组产量平均达到四○八公斤。九道小组的计划是要求减少废品，提高质量。大家便虚心学习先进经验，提高技术，找出出废品的原因，想出克服的办法，使全组每月的废品从五千多个减少到二百多个。赵恩波小组的计划是要求提高技术，改进工具。大家便组织技术研究会，请老工人讲解技术问题。结果工人普遍提高技术，改进了十七种作样板的工具。
    但是，小组爱国公约只能解决小组内部的问题，各部门之间在重要环节上还必须互相配合，这就要签订联系合同。例如二车间与五车间都需要彼此保证质量，才能完成自己的计划，于是便签订联系合同，规定一方产品质量不好时对方不接受，引起大家对于质量的重视。二车间以好的产品送到五车间，五车间的产品质量也就有了保证。又如材料管理部门与直接生产车间，双方都感到要想完成自己的计划，必须一方按需要有计划的领取材料，一方及时供给材料。根据这个要求，双方订立联系合同互相保证，双方都完成了自己的计划。
    各部门签订小组爱国公约与联系合同，互相保证完成了自己的计划，也就是完成了整个计划，这也就是集体合同的实现。
    四、建立检查制度
    建立检查制度，及时解决问题，是保证合同实现的重要一环。为此，该厂成立了集体合同检查委员会（现改为按党政工团各系统派人联合检查），进行定期与不定期的检查，解决了执行合同中的许多问题。如有些部门执行合同不严格，对别人却要求很严格（甚至超过检验规格），造成对方不应有的返工浪费；有的部门与别人订了合同，没有很好地向职工传达，以致职工不知要保证什么；有的部门在执行合同中遇到困难，不能按时实现合同……。检查组发现了这些问题，即配合有关部门进行教育，指出执行合同应有的正确态度，和发动职工研究实现合同的办法。另外为了更广泛深入地检查合同，还发动群众进行自我检查与互相检查。到了一定期间，领导方面召集车间以上的干部开会，系统地指出执行合同中的偏向和缺点，组织讨论，研究改进的办法，使合同逐步贯彻下去。
    五、改变企业管理面貌，超额
    完成生产任务
    沈阳三二一工厂按照以上作法签订集体合同，自一九五○年五月至今，一直把合同坚持下去，这对于改进企业管理与提高生产起了很大作用。
    在签订集体合同以前，该厂的企业管理很差，除了经过初步的民主改革，职工开始提高阶级觉悟之外，旧的管理制度尚未很好改变，新的管理制度很不健全，形成管理部门赶不上生产的需要，影响生产的发展。自签订集体合同以后，这个局面完全改变过来了。
    首先是实现了生产平衡，贯彻了经济核算制。集体合同通过小组爱国公约与联系合同，把全体职工、各个部门组织起来，互相配合、互相保证完成自己的生产计划（也就是完成了整个生产计划）。这种有组织有计划的生产，使得生产达到了平衡发展。在这一基础上，加强了定额管理。之后，又加强了成本管理。实行了分部成本计算，同时车间和小组也实行了成本管理，现在又推行了“个人积累手册”，正向个别经济核算发展。这样，事先就能控制成本，事后也能分析成本。其次，职工为了保证合同的实现，签订师徒合同，组织技术学习，提高了技术水平，修改了旧的技术操作规程，制定了技术质量责任制与技术安全制。第三，加强了福利设施。过去的福利设施只有澡堂和合作社，现在签订集体合同两年来，已拿出厂长基金六、七十亿元，举办了许多集体福利事业。如建立了业余休养所、慢性病疗养所、托儿所、子弟学校、图书馆、电影院、广播站等，解决了工房的通风设备问题。职工在有碍身体健康的工序工作时，每天能享用牛奶鸡蛋等保健食品。在这一基础上，在全体职工忘我劳作之下，每年都是全面地超额完成生产任务。一九五○年的生产任务比一九四九年加大二倍，却超过任务百分之二十三。一九五一年比一九五○年的任务加大百分之八十七，仍超过任务百分之八。每日产量则比伪满和国民党时期提高了四倍。在质量方面，一九五○年提高百分之十三点五，一九五一年提高百分之七。使良品率从伪满和国民党时期的百分之四十提高到百分之九十六点五。在成本方面，一九五○年的成本比计划成本降低百分之三十二，一九五一年的成本比计划成本降低百分之十五，今年上半年的成本比计划成本降低百分之五点六四。生产周期从八十五天缩短到四十四天。
