    To the China Peace Committee:

    To the China Peace Committee: Our unit's first Hero Representatives Conference has opened on the Korean front. During the conference, when we recalled every achievement and victory, we couldn't help but think of your and the people of the whole country's active support and encouragement for us. Here, on behalf of all the heroes and all the officers and soldiers of our unit, we extend our heartfelt thanks to you and the people of the motherland.

    Since entering Korea, our unit has victoriously completed various combat and work tasks. In the past two years, we have annihilated 33,900 enemies, and produced 166 heroes, meritorious individuals, and model units, and 7,910 heroes, meritorious individuals, and model figures. Among them are: the "Tiande Mountain Hero Company" that stubbornly resisted for four days and nights and achieved brilliant results; the "Special Merit Fifth Company" that fought alone for three days and nights, continuously repelled 28 enemy charges, and killed and wounded more than 1,200 enemies; the "First-Class Hero Squad" that held the 300 Heights for nine days and nights and annihilated more than 400 enemies; the heroic fighting "Night Moon Mountain Hero Squad"; and the Third Company cooking squad, which took the initiative to participate in combat, steadily defended its position, and won the title of "Second-Class Hero Squad." There are also Hao Zhixin, a special-class meritorious person with both wisdom and courage; Zhao Hengzhi, an excellent platoon leader who led his troops to fight more with less; Ji Yannian, a political instructor who personally led his troops, fully exerted the power of political work, and organized his troops to complete combat missions; Ji Tailin, a hero grenade thrower who threw 108 grenades in a row and annihilated more than 60 enemies; Fu Guide, a first-class meritorious scout who bravely captured prisoners; Chen Honglin, the "Wanli Hao" car driver and first-class meritorious person; and the immortal internationalist fighter, model Youth League member, and "First-Class Loving-the-People Model" Luo Shengjiao, and others. This is the glory of the people of the motherland, and it is also your glory! Because these victories and honors were all achieved under the direct support of the people of the motherland and you.

    At present, the aggressive ambitions of American imperialism have not died out, the policy of expanding the war is still being carried out, and the security of the motherland and the peace of the world are still under serious threat. We are determined to fight more heroically, give the enemy more severe blows, defend the motherland, and defend peace in the Far East and the world.

Volunteer Army, First Hero Representatives Conference, All Representatives
