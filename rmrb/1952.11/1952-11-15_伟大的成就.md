Great Achievements

Zhou Xinfang

In recent days, we have been fortunate enough to witness the wonderful performances of Soviet artists who came to China to participate in the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities. From these many performances, we can deeply realize that the reason why socialist art has such a high degree of development is that it is owned by the people and is a vivid expression of the actual life of the Soviet people. These wonderful programs, after the Soviet artists' long-term deliberation, have reached the point of perfection.

Comrade Ulanova's classical dance is one of the most impressive programs. Her artistic success is undoubtedly the result of her long-term hard work. When we watch her performance, we are all attracted by her beautiful image. Her every gesture shows her amazing clarity and harmony in art. In her continuous performance from one posture to another, she shows the most beautiful image, which is what every painter and sculptor hopes to capture at all times.

The soft gymnastics performance by Comrades Karakchova and Puchin also demonstrates the results of their long-term labor in artistic life. Every movement of theirs makes people feel relaxed, happy, and agile, without any sense of effort, and is full of rhythm. This should be a good demonstration for our Peking Opera's martial arts training.

Comrade Maxim Mikhailov's singing showed outstanding achievements. His voice has developed to the peak of sonorous and mellow at his current high age. His Russian folk songs, whether "Song of the Volga Boatmen" or "Along the Peter Street," are full of vitality and endowed with new vitality.

In folk art, the Soviet Union has also achieved amazing development. Comrade Sergei Obraztsov's puppet show is truly an interesting, wonderful, and educational artistic performance; especially for children, it plays such a good educational and entertainment role. Comrade Obraztsov's current method of performing puppets with his fingers is extremely similar to that of our country's puppet show. This should not be regarded as accidental; it also shows the wisdom and ingenuity of the working people of China and the Soviet Union in artistic creation. In the future, if we want to develop puppet shows, I think we must first absorb the valuable experience created by Soviet artists in this area.

    伟大的成就
    周信芳
    最近这几天来，我们很幸运地看到了来我国参加“中苏友好月”活动的苏联艺术家的精彩表演。从这许多表演节目中，我们可以极其深切地认识到，社会主义艺术所以有那么高度的发展，乃是由于它为人民所有，是苏联人民的实际生活的生动的表现。这些精彩的节目，经过苏联艺术家长期的琢磨，已经到了尽善尽美的境地。
    乌兰诺娃同志的古典舞，是给人印象极深的节目之一。她的艺术上的成功，无疑是她长期刻苦努力的结果。我们在看她的表演时，无不被她那种优美的形象所吸引住。她的一举手一投足，都显示了她艺术上的惊人的明朗与和谐。在她从一个姿态变到另一个姿态的连续不断的表演过程中，都表现了最优美的形象，这种优美的形象，是每一个绘画家和雕塑家所时刻希望捕捉的。
    卡拉巧娃和普奇岑同志的柔软体操表演，也表现了他们在艺术生活上长期劳动的成果。他们的每一个动作，都使人感到轻松、愉快、敏捷，丝毫没有费力之感，而且充满了节奏感。这对于我们京戏中的武打训练，应该说是一个很好的示范。
    马克西姆·米哈伊洛夫同志的歌唱，表现了卓越的成就。他的嗓音到他今日这样的高龄，已经发展到了宏亮、浑厚的高峰。他的俄罗斯民歌，无论是“伏尔加船夫曲”或是“沿着彼得大街”，都充沛着生命力，赋予了新的生命力。
    在民间艺术上，苏联也得到了惊人的发展。谢尔盖·奥布拉兹卓夫同志所表演的木偶戏，真是一种有趣的奇妙无比而又富有教育意义的艺术表演；特别是对于儿童，起着多么良好的教育和娱乐作用。奥布拉兹卓夫同志现在用手指表演木偶的方法，与我国的木偶戏是极其相似的。这不应该把它看成是偶然的，这同样表现了我们中苏两国劳动人民在艺术创造上的智慧和巧妙。今后我们要发展木偶戏，我想我们首先要吸取苏联艺术家们在这一方面所创造的宝贵经验。
