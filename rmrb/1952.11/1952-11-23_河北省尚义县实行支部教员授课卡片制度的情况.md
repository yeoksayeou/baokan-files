The following is a report on the inspection conducted by the former Propaganda Department of the CPC Chahar Provincial Committee on Shangyi County (formerly under Chahar Province, now under Hebei Province) regarding the implementation of the Branch Instructor Lecture Card System, which was created in June 1951 and promoted throughout the province in July of the same year:

I. The Origin and Role of the Branch Instructor Lecture Card System

Before the implementation of the Branch Instructor Lecture Card System, only two or three Party affairs cadres in each district were responsible for branch education, with other Party member cadres not involved. County-level cadres also did not give lectures to branch members when they went to work in the countryside. As a result, the majority of Party members had few opportunities to receive education. Many branch members did not receive education for months. In light of this situation, the county Party committee, after research, believed that Party member cadres must conscientiously undertake the task of lecturing to grassroots Party members. Thus, the Branch Instructor Lecture Card System was created. The Propaganda Department of the county Party committee also formulated the specific content of the Branch Instructor Lecture Cards and stipulated a system for summarizing and reporting on the lecture situation each month. This has greatly changed the strengthening of political and ideological education of Party members and overcoming the isolated phenomenon in branch education. At the same time, it has strengthened the sense of responsibility of branch instructors in conscientiously carrying out Party member education. For example, cadres in the first and sixth districts attend preparatory classes before going to the countryside. Branch instructors also pay attention to understanding the ideological problems of Party members in advance, which has been very effective in overcoming dogmatism in education and improving the role of education.

II. Achievements Gained in Branch Education Work After Implementing the Card System

Before the implementation of the card system, less than forty of the county's one hundred and fifty Party member cadres were able to give lectures to branches. After the implementation of the card system, sixty people regularly maintained the practice of lecturing to branches once or twice a month. Of the county's one hundred and fifty-two branches and thirty-two dissemination stations, seventy-seven branches each received two educations in July of last year, and each dissemination station disseminated twice. Twenty-two branches and six dissemination stations in the third district also conducted one education each in July. In the past, a maximum of only fifteen branches could be lectured to once a month. In the past, only four or five people in the sixth district lectured to Party members in the branches, and they could only teach seven or eight branches each month. After the implementation of the card system, the number of cadre Party members lecturing to branches increased to eight. In October of last year, they gave a total of forty-eight lectures to seventeen branches in the district, averaging six lectures per person. In October of this year, five cadres spent four days lecturing to ten branches once each and lecturing once at a dissemination station. From the above situation, it seems that the card system has indeed played a great role in strengthening branch education. At the same time, it has promoted the balanced development of branch education, which is of great help in further improving the ideological awareness of Party members. For example, Party members in Xiajiabao Village in the seventh district, who had rarely received education in the past, only knew how to take the lead in work, and did not understand other principles. After the implementation of the card system, the district Party committee often gave them lectures, and the Party members' awareness was raised. They requested: "You must give us more lectures in the future." Ruan Peixiang, a Party member in Baodetang Village in the sixth district, when he returned to his hometown of Huaian in February of this year to farm, asked the district Party committee for his Party relationship and said: "Losing a cow is not a big deal, but losing the Party relationship is not okay."

On the other hand, the card system has strengthened the organizational concept of branch instructors and promoted the study of general Party member cadres. For example, Zhang Changming, the personnel section chief of the county cooperative, and Yang Linsen, the president of the bank, took the initiative to receive the task of lecturing to branches when they went to work in the countryside. Jiang Cunyi, a cadre of the armed forces department in the sixth district, felt very ashamed when the branch asked him to give a Party lecture while he was working in the countryside because he had a low level of education and could not give a lecture. This prompted him to study. At the same time, it enabled some cadres to learn how to do branch education work. In the past, lectures were generally given without preparing beforehand, and the matter was considered finished after the lecture, regardless of the effect. Now, the general feeling is: if you are careless in carrying out branch education, you will not be able to complete the task. For example, Fang Yuzhen in the first district said: "Since the implementation of the card system, the responsibility has been clarified first, and there can be no carelessness at all. If an attitude of perfunctoriness is adopted, the gains, experiences, and reflections of Party members on the card cannot be filled out." The organization committee member of the sixth district said: "After the implementation of the card system, I learned how to do branch education work. First, I have to understand the content of the lecture, then understand the thoughts of Party members, and then go to give the lecture. When lecturing, do not talk too long, and after explaining a problem, organize Party members to discuss it. If there are any questions, explain them again. This is very effective. At the same time, we can understand the degree of acceptance of Party members in a timely manner and improve teaching." In short, since the implementation of the Branch Instructor Lecture Card System, the quality of branch education work has been improved, especially the branch education in remote villages has been strengthened. At the same time, branch education has been carried out more systematically than in the past, and the content of education has been consistent (in the past, each taught their own set), which has improved the quality of teaching.

However, there are shortcomings in the implementation of the Branch Instructor Lecture Card System, which is that the county Party committee does not pay enough attention to it and has failed to improve the system. Although the teaching situation is summarized and published monthly, it is only confined to numerical statistics, and the experience has not been summarized and promoted. At the same time, there is a lack of inspection work, which has led to formalism in the implementation of the system, and many districts have used cards to replace work reports. These problems should be addressed in the future, and organizational leadership work should be continuously strengthened in order to consolidate and persist in this system.

### 河北省尚义县实行支部教员授课卡片制度的情况

    河北省尚义县实行支部教员授课卡片制度的情况
    一九五一年六月间，尚义县（原属察哈尔省，现划归河北省）创建了支部教员授课卡片制度。七月间，经原察哈尔省委宣传部通报各地，各地就推行起来了。不久以前，原察哈尔省委宣传部派人到尚义县进行了一次检查。今将检查情况，报告如下：
    一、支部教员授课卡片制度的来源和作用
    在未实行支部教员授课卡片制度前，各区仅有二、三个党务干部进行支部教育，其他党员干部不过问。县级干部下乡工作，也不给支部党员上课。因此，广大党员受教育的机会少。还有不少支部党员数月受不到一次教育。根据这种情形，经县委研究，认为党员干部必须认真担负起给基层党员上课的任务。因此才创建了支部教员授课卡片制度。县委宣传部并拟制了支部教员授课卡片的具体内容，和规定了每月将授课情况总结通报等制度。这样一来，对加强党员政治思想教育，克服支部教育上的孤立现象，有了很大转变。同时也加强了支部教员认真进行党员教育的责任心。如一、六区干部，下乡前先上预备课。支部教员到村也注意事先了解党员的思想问题，这对克服教育中的教条主义、提高教育作用收效很大。
    二、实行卡片制度后支部教育工作所获得的成绩
    未实行卡片制度前，全县一五○个党员干部，能给支部上课者不足四十人。卡片制度执行以后，有六十人经常能保持每月给支部上课一至二次。全县支部一五二个、传授站三二个，去年七月份有七十七个支部各受到了二次教育，每个传授站传授了二次。三区二十二个支部、六个传授站，七月份也各进行了一次教育。过去每月最多只能给十五个支部各上一次课。六区过去只有四五个人给支部党员上课，每月也只能教七八个支部。实行卡片制度后，干部党员给支部上课人数增至八人，去年十月给全区十七个支部共上了四十八次课，每人平均上课六次。今年十月份，五个干部四天时间，就给十个支部各上课一次，并在一个传授站授课一次。从以上情形看来，卡片制度对加强支部教育确实作用很大。同时，使支部教育平衡发展，对进一步提高党员思想觉悟，有很大帮助。如七区夏家堡村的党员，过去很少受到教育，党员们只知道个带头干，其它道理便不清楚。卡片制度实行后，区委经常给他们上课，党员觉悟提高了，他们要求：“你们今后可得多给我们来上课哩。”六区保德堂村党员阮培祥，今年二月间回原籍怀安去种地时，找区委要党的关系，并说：“丢我一头牛不要紧，丢了党的关系可不行。”
    另一方面，卡片制度加强了支部教员的组织观念，也促进了一般党员干部的学习。如县合作社人事股长张昌明、银行行长杨林森下乡工作时，也主动找党委领受给支部上课的任务。六区武装部干事姜存义，下乡工作时支部要求他上党课，因他文化水平低，不能上课，感觉很不光彩。这样促使了他去学习。同时，并使一些干部学会了如何作支部教育工作。过去上课一般是事先不准备课，讲课后完事大吉，不管效果如何。现在一般反映说：进行支部教育，马虎一点就完不成任务。如一区方玉珍说：“自从实行卡片制以后，首先明确了责任，一点都不能马虎。如果采取应付态度，卡片上的收获、经验和党员思想反映等项，就无法填写。”六区组织委员说：“卡片制度执行后，使我学会了作支部教育工作。首先要把课的内容弄清楚，再了解党员思想，然后去上课。讲课时不要讲得太长，讲完一个问题后就组织党员讨论，有什么问题再解释，这样收效大。同时也能及时了解党员接受程度，改进教学。”总之，实行支部教员授课卡片制度以来，提高了支部教育工作的质量，特别是对偏僻村庄的支部教育加强了。同时也使支部教育较已往有系统地进行了，并作到了教育内容的一致（过去常是各教各的一套），提高了教课的质量。
    但是，在执行支部教员授课卡片制度上，还有缺点，这就是县委领导上不够重视，未能使这一制度改进提高。虽然教学情况逐月总结公布，只是拘泥于数字上的统计，而未将经验加以总结推广。同时缺乏检查工作，使这一制度的执行发生了形式主义，不少区以卡片代替了工作报告。以上这些问题，今后应注意解决，并应不断加强组织领导工作，才能使这一制度巩固和坚持下去。
