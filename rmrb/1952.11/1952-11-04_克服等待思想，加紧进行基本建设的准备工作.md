Brief Commentary on Economic Life

    Only two months remain in 1952. Various regions are working intensely to prepare for next year's large-scale economic construction. Experience has already proven that whether preparations are done well is a major factor in whether basic construction work can be done well. Today, we introduce how the Fuxin Mining Bureau carried out its preparations for basic construction in 1952. This is an example of preparations done well, and it provides us with beneficial experiences in many aspects.

    The Fuxin Mining Bureau's preparations last year were successful primarily because they truly recognized the importance of preparatory work and overcame the mentality of waiting. They were adept at finding patterns and learning lessons from the work already done, replacing the mentality of waiting with an active and proactive spirit. They seized upon and carried out whatever work could be done at the time. For matters that needed to wait for decisions from higher authorities, they also made full preparations in advance so that work could begin immediately after the higher authorities made their decisions. Therefore, the Fuxin Mining Bureau's basic construction work in 1952 was freed from a blind and passive situation.

    Secondly, they were good at grasping the main links in the work. The Fuxin Mining Bureau had a large basic construction task, and there were many preparations that needed to be done. Where should they start? The Fuxin Mining Bureau ranked all projects and every task, concentrating its efforts on solving the most important problems first. By using this scientific working method, they ensured that they could concentrate their forces, overcome chaos, and ensure the smooth progress of this year's basic construction work.

    Thirdly, the Fuxin Mining Bureau's preparations last year relied entirely on the masses. Basic construction work is complex, and the leadership lacks experience. If the broad masses are not educated to correctly understand preparatory work, if the strength of the broad masses is not mobilized, and if the initiative and creativity of the masses are not fully brought into play, the work cannot be done well. Because the Fuxin Mining Bureau relied on the masses, it not only overcame the difficulties in preparing equipment and materials but also formulated average advanced norms, ensuring that the plan was reasonable and practical.

    However, there are still many units that, although they know that the task of basic construction next year is arduous, are still "waiting" and "delaying," and have not regarded the preparation for basic construction as the top priority at present. Some units are still busy completing this year's production plan, putting daily production work in the primary position, or treating production and basic construction work as equal, so that basic construction work is delayed again and again. Some units are still shouting that their strength is insufficient, only knowing to reach out to higher authorities for personnel, without the determination to transfer the most experienced and strongest cadres from production posts to basic construction posts. Some units are still waiting for the plan to be determined and waiting for orders, without seizing the opportunity to carry out the preparations that can be started...… The leading comrades of these units should quickly correct this erroneous thinking, overcome difficulties, and take immediate action. Doing one more point of preparatory work this year will reduce ten points of difficulty next year.

### 克服等待思想，加紧进行基本建设的准备工作

    克服等待思想，加紧进行基本建设的准备工作
    一九五二年只剩下两个月了。各地正在紧张地为明年的大规模经济建设进行准备。经验已经证明，准备工作作得好坏，是基本建设工作能否做好的一个主要环节。今天，我们介绍了阜新矿务局怎样进行一九五二年基本建设的准备工作，这是一个准备工作作得好的例子，在许多方面为我们提供了有益的经验。
    阜新矿务局去年的准备工作所以做得好，首先是因为他们真正认识了准备工作的重要性，克服了等待思想。他们善于从已经作过的工作中寻找规律接受教训，以积极主动的精神代替等待思想，凡是当时可能进行的工作就抓紧进行；凡是需要等候上级决定的，也先作充分准备，以便上级决定后立即展开工作。因此阜新矿务局一九五二年的基本建设工作，就摆脱了盲目被动的局面。
    其次，就是他们善于抓着工作的主要环节。阜新矿务局基本建设的任务很大，应该做的准备工作很多，究竟应该从何着手呢？阜新矿务局把所有的工程以及每项工作都排了队，集中力量首先解决最主要的问题。由于运用这种科学的工作方法，就保证了他们能以集中使用力量，克服忙乱现象，使今年的基本建设工作能顺利进行。
    再次，就是阜新矿务局去年的准备工作，一切依靠群众。基本建设工作复杂，领导方面又缺乏经验，如不教育广大群众正确认识准备工作，不动员广大群众的力量，不充分发挥群众的积极性和创造性，工作是无法做好的。阜新矿务局由于依靠了群众，不但克服了设备、器材准备的困难，并且制定了平均先进定额，保证了计划的合理和切合实际。
    但是，现在也还有许多单位，他们虽然也知道明年基本建设的任务繁重，可是还在那里“等待”和“拖延”，没有把基本建设的准备工作当成目前的首要任务。有的单位还只是忙着完成今年的生产计划，把日常生产工作放在首要地位，或者把生产与基本建设工作同等看待，以致基本建设工作被一拖再拖；有的单位还在那里叫喊力量不足，只知向上伸手要人，而没有决心从生产岗位上将最有经验的最强的干部调到基本建设岗位上去；有的单位，还在等待确定计划、等待订货而没有抓紧时机，进行可以开始进行的准备工作………。这些单位的领导同志，都应该赶快纠正这种错误思想，克服困难，立即行动起来。今年多做一分准备工作，明年就可减少十分困难。
