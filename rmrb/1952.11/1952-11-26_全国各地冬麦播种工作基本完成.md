Winter wheat planting has been basically completed across the country. The sown area of winter wheat in all major wheat-producing areas has now been completed or exceeded according to the planned targets. For example, Pingyuan Province has expanded its wheat fields by 870,000 mu this year compared to last year; Hebei Province has expanded its planting area by 20% compared to last year; and the Subei area has expanded by 6.5% compared to last year.

This year's winter wheat planting work was completed during the patriotic winter wheat production increase campaign. After nine state-owned mechanized farms, three local state-owned farms, one agricultural producers' cooperative, and twelve mutual aid teams jointly issued a challenge letter for the winter wheat production increase competition, many agricultural producers' cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers in the main wheat-producing areas of Pingyuan, Hebei, Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Shandong, and the Subei area responded to the challenge and launched a chain competition within their respective provinces. Puyang Prefecture in Pingyuan Province convened a joint meeting of county heads, focusing on Qingfeng and Puyang counties, to launch a competition between counties. In Shanxi Province, Wuxiang County alone had 1,400 agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams participating in the "Thousand Jin Wheat Competition" campaign. The winter wheat production increase competition in the Southwest region was also widely launched, with 26 state-owned farms, 3,247 model workers, and 42,857 mutual aid teams participating across the region. In Suining Prefecture, Sichuan Province, there were more than 197,200 mu of high-yield fields participating in the high-yield competition. Before planting, the leaders in various places had conscientiously summarized the experience of high wheat yields from the previous season and actively promoted advanced cultivation techniques. In late August, the Subei area invited wheat high-yield models, agricultural experts, and agricultural technicians to summarize the experience of high-yield wheat farmers. At the wheat high-yield forum in Jiangdu County, an outline for improving local wheat planting techniques was drafted. Under the slogan of "taking one point to lead the whole area," Nantong County established more than 9,600 wheat high-yield demonstration points throughout the county and systematically launched the work of promoting advanced cultivation techniques. The units and farmers in Anhui Province who initiated the wheat production increase competition mostly studied the advanced experience of dense planting of wheat in the Soviet Union, implemented strip planting, and widened the sowing width. Hebei, Pingyuan, Shanxi, and other provinces also made specific arrangements and guidance for cultivation techniques. Many counties in Sichuan Province have established county-level production technology research associations to specifically guide farmers in improving wheat cultivation techniques. This year, farmers in various places generally plowed half an inch to one inch deeper than last year. The cultivated land in Pingyuan Province generally reached five to six inches deep. The wheat fields in the Southwest region were all deeply plowed to a depth of five to seven inches. In Laiyang Prefecture, Shandong, about 25% of the land was plowed one to two inches deeper than last year, and about 55% of the land was plowed twice. In terms of dense planting of wheat, densely planted wheat fields accounted for 50.3% of all wheat fields in Pingyuan Province; densely planted wheat fields accounted for about 30% of all wheat fields in Hebei and Shanxi provinces. Twelve local state-owned farms in Ya'an and Xichang in Xikang, and 37 mutual aid teams in Luding and Yuejun, etc., planted wheat using dense planting methods in order to strive for high yields next year. Farmers in Yexian County, Shandong, who created the "nest wheat" cultivation method, expanded the planting area of "nest wheat" to more than 20,000 mu this year. The amount of fertilizer applied to wheat fields and the area fertilized in various places have increased compared to last year. For example, in Hebei Province, the average application of coarse fertilizer per mu of wheat field increased by 20% to 30% compared to last year; in Shanxi Province, the fertilizer application area of wheat fields was only 72% last year, but increased to 80% this year. All of these have laid a good foundation for increasing wheat production next year.

### 全国各地冬麦播种工作基本完成

    全国各地冬麦播种工作基本完成
    全国各地冬小麦已基本播种完毕。现在各主要产麦区冬小麦的播种面积，都按照预定计划完成或超计划完成了。如平原省今年播种的麦田比去年扩大八十七万亩；河北省播种面积比去年扩大百分之二十；苏北区比去年扩大百分之六·五。
    今年各地冬小麦播种工作是在冬小麦爱国增产竞赛运动中完成的。自九个国营机耕农场、三个地方国营农场、一个农业生产合作社和十二个互助组分别联名发出冬小麦增产竞赛的挑战书后，主要小麦产区平原、河北、河南、陕西、山西、山东等省和苏北区的许多农业生产合作社、互助组和个体农民纷纷应战，并在本省内展开了连环竞赛。平原省濮阳专区召开了县长联席会议，以清丰、濮阳两县为重点，展开了县与县之间的竞赛。山西省仅武乡一县，就有一千四百个农业生产合作社和互助组参加了小麦“千斤竞赛”运动。西南区冬小麦增产竞赛也广泛展开，全区参加竞赛的有二十六个国营农场，三千二百四十七个劳动模范，四万二千八百五十七个互助组。四川省遂宁专区参加高额竞赛的丰产田有十九万七千二百多亩。播种前，各地领导上都曾认真总结了上届小麦的丰产经验，积极推广了先进的耕作技术。苏北区八月下旬邀请了小麦丰产模范、农业专家和农业技术工作人员，总结小麦丰产户的经验。江都县的小麦丰产座谈会上，拟定出改进本地小麦种植技术纲要。南通县在“万点带面”的口号下，全县建立了九千六百多个小麦丰产点，有计划地展开了推广先进耕作技术的工作。安徽省发起小麦增产竞赛的各单位和农民，绝大部分都学习了苏联小麦密植的先进经验，实行条播并加宽了播幅。河北、平原、山西等省也都对栽培技术作了具体的布置和指导。四川省不少县都成立了县的生产技术研究会，具体指导农民改进小麦耕作技术。今年各地农民在耕作方面，一般都比去年深耕了半寸到一寸。平原省耕地一般都达到五六寸深。西南区的麦田，都深耕五寸到七寸。山东莱阳专区，约有百分之二十五的土地较去年深耕了一寸到二寸，约有百分之五十五的土地耕过两遍。小麦密植方面，平原省密植的麦田占全部麦田的百分之五十点三；河北、山西两省密植的麦田约占全部麦田的百分之三十。西康雅安、西昌等十二个地方国营农场，和泸定、越隽等三十七个互助组为争取明年丰产，都以密植法播种小麦。创造“窝麦”栽培法的山东掖县农民，今年扩大“窝麦”种植面积达二万多亩。各地麦田施肥量和施肥面积较去年又有增加。例如河北省的麦田，平均每亩施用粗肥比去年增加百分之二十到三十；山西省麦地的施肥面积去年只有百分之七十二，今年增加到百分之八十。这些，都奠定了明年小麦增产的良好基础。
