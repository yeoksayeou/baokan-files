Visiting the Outstanding Peace Warrior—Poet Tikhonov
Yuan Shuipai

Appearing before the reporters was a robust old man with silver hair and a healthy, ruddy complexion. Beneath his prominent brow ridges shone clear eyes. His strong jaw and the corners of his mouth, revealing a resolute expression, were reminiscent of the head of a fearless hero sculpted by an artist.

Indeed, that is exactly what Nikolai Semenovich Tikhonov, the famous Soviet poet, tireless defender of world peace, and head of the Soviet cultural workers delegation visiting China for the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities, is: an old warrior who has lived through a stormy and prolonged history of struggle, with outstanding achievements.

During the Civil War, Red Army soldier Tikhonov participated in the revolutionary war to defeat enemies both at home and abroad. After the Civil War ended, with the vigorous development of socialist economic and cultural construction, new Soviet literary talents emerged one after another, and Tikhonov was one of these young writers. He became one of the outstanding Soviet poets, loved by Soviet readers since the 1920s, and a successor to the cause of Gorky and Mayakovsky. He was awarded the Stalin Prize for Literature three times.

During the Great Patriotic War, he was known for his courage and steadfastness, using literary weapons to participate in the struggle to defend Leningrad. In the past three years, as Chairman of the Soviet Peace Committee and a member of the World Peace Council, he has represented the Soviet people dozens of times on peace platforms in his own country and in France, Italy, Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Pakistan, and other countries, passionately calling on the people of the world to fight for peace. At the same time, he also serves as a representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and Deputy Secretary-General of the Soviet Writers' Association. Busy and intense social activities are closely combined with his rich creative career.

This old warrior, whose lapel is adorned with many medals, including the Order of Lenin, the Stalin Prize Medal, the Order of the Red Banner... is already fifty-five years old, but he still appeared so strong and energetic before the reporters. He patiently answered the reporters' questions at length for two hours and forty minutes.

First, Comrade Tikhonov answered the reporters' questions about his initial impressions of coming to China this time. He said that all the delegates were visiting China for the first time. In the past, they had only learned about China from books and newspapers. This time, they were very happy to have the opportunity to see China with their own eyes. When the train crossed the border and entered Chinese territory, everyone was very excited. They gazed at the land of China from the train windows for a long time. He said: "Even through the small window, we saw the diverse and rich life of New China... Everywhere there was enthusiastic welcome and friendly reception, and when we arrived at Beijing Railway Station, it reached a boiling point. All this will be unforgettable for the rest of our lives." He also said that from the warm welcome he received along the way, he felt even more deeply how sincere and great the friendship between China and the Soviet Union is; at the same time, he also realized that all the welcoming masses are so great, so healthy and happy, because they have been liberated. The poet smiled happily and told the reporters that from the singing and dancing of young people, women, and children, he saw that they were people with unlimited bright prospects, "the future is open to them."

Tikhonov said that these are only initial impressions, and the overall impression will have to wait until the delegation's activities in China are over. The delegates will go to various parts of China to participate in many activities. In his own interesting words, they will: those who can sing will sing, those who can act will act, and those who can dance will dance. Those who cannot sing, act, or dance will do other work according to their professions. Agronomists will meet with Chinese agronomists, musicians will hold discussions with students from Chinese conservatories, historians will visit places where important historical events took place, and he himself will exchange views with Chinese cultural and artistic circles. They will all participate in many seminars and attend many reports. In short, Tikhonov said, in the past he only knew China from books, and now he will understand China firsthand, which is a matter of great excitement.

Next, the reporters asked him to talk about his own works first, especially the poems that won the Stalin Prize three times. In this regard, the poet modestly only said a few simple words, but readers all over the world, including those in China, know that these works are shining with brilliant artistic talent and have lofty value. Soviet critics, when discussing these works, made the following respectful description of the author: he "concentrated the most beautiful qualities of the Soviet intelligentsia: sensitivity to the important cause of the current era, the broad mind and mature thinking of a politician, the loyal desire to contribute his strength and talent to the people, true humanism and noble patriotism." (See Knipovich's essay in "Soviet Literature," March of this year)

Indeed, the works of the esteemed poet Tikhonov are full of these beautiful thoughts and feelings.

His first work to win the Stalin Prize was a collection of poems written in 1941, mainly "Kirov Is With Us" (translated and published in "Selected Poems of the Soviet Patriotic War" translated by Lin Ling, etc.). This long poem describes how the heroic people unyieldingly resisted the German invaders and defended Leningrad; in the poem, the author imagines Kirov, the beloved leader of the Leningrad workers, who was assassinated by the enemy in 1934, patrolling at night. When the people of Leningrad felt that the great leader was fighting with them, they were even more courageous and full of fighting spirit.

The poet told us: "The content of this poem is no different from the actual situation at the time. When I was writing, the sound of air raid bombings and the whistling of shells were ringing around me, and shrapnel was flying everywhere. Leningrad was going through the most difficult years of the siege, but the incomparably heroic Red Army and patriotic people were so full of confidence in victory that they prompted me to write this poem." Although this sentence is very simple, the poet has told us the fundamental reason for the success of this poem.

At that time, Tikhonov went to the factory to recite this work. Fadeyev described that recitation: "The beauty of the poem itself, coupled with the fact that the author created it in a cold room by the flickering candlelight in a cruel winter, plus the fact that the poet personally recited it to the workers in the basement of a factory that was being violently bombarded, further increased the power of the poem. The audience listened intently, motionless, and the whole place was filled with focused and serious faces." (This quotation is also taken from the above-mentioned Knipovich's essay) When reading certain parts of the poem, tears streamed down the cheeks of the male and female workers; when the entire poem was read, the audience applauded and cheered even more enthusiastically. The solemn image of Kirov appeared so movingly in the poem:

Bombs whistle over the Neva River,
Rolling up flames to burn the bridge.
Regardless of the midnight air raid,
Braving the roar of midnight artillery fire,
In the iron night of Leningrad,
Kirov patrols the whole city.

Wearing a soldier's marching coat,
As if in front of the army,
………
The star on the cap emits a red light,
Eyes shining like burning fire,
……
His proud heart is very happy,
The people are so unyielding,
………

This is a poem that combines revolutionary romanticism and realism. From here, any reader will feel the author's strong patriotic enthusiasm. This poem was immediately loved by Soviet readers and widely circulated among the people, becoming one of the outstanding literary works of the era of the Great Patriotic War.

The second collection of poems that won the prize was named "Georgian Spring." The beautiful scenery of Georgia particularly attracted the poet, and this theme had already appeared in his early poems. The vineyard farmers, shepherds, and hunters there are the protagonists in his works. He has a deep friendship with the Georgian people. He translated many of their national poems, and he is an authoritative scholar of Georgian culture. He excitedly said that Stalin's hometown is Gori, a city in Georgia. In the poet's award-winning collection of poems, most of them are about the Georgian people engaged in large-scale peaceful construction projects such as hydropower stations after the war, and the background of these constructions is Georgia's sunny fields and beautiful ancient mountains. The warm and lyrical praise for the life of the Soviet people attracts readers of poetry.

In 1950, the author attended the Warsaw Peace Congress. At the meeting, he wrote a poem on the spot about Polish children offering flowers to the Chinese delegation; and personally gave this poem to the Chinese delegation as a gift. The author used simple but meaningful and beautiful sentences to describe that China has gone through all the hardships and has been liberated, and the Chinese people have stood up and appeared gloriously in front of all countries in the world (this poem has been translated by Liu Qun and published in this newspaper on January 7, 1951):

There is such a thing: all the difficulties have passed,
As if a simple sentence is flying in front of your eyes;
I really saw with my own eyes: the child's gentle hand,
Touching the shoulder of China.

This poem, together with eight other poems describing the Peace Congress, form the group of poems "At the Second World Peace Congress"; together with the group of poems "Two Huge Currents" published by the author after visiting Pakistan and Afghanistan in 1949, won last year's Stalin Literary Prize due to their sincere and lofty patriotic and internationalist ideological feelings and their role in inspiring the national liberation struggles of the colonial people.

The poet's enthusiastic conversation continued, and the topic shifted from his personal literary creation to the situation of Soviet literature after the war. But due to time constraints, he could only give a brief overview:

Soviet writers have expanded their ranks after the war, and new writers have joined the ranks one after another. Before the war, they were still young and their works were not mature enough. After the tempering and testing of the war, they began to write outstanding works. Old writers also regained writing time during this period and completed their unfinished creations one after another. For example, Fedin completed "Unusual Summer," which reflected the lives of the people during the Civil War, and A. Tolstoy continued writing "Peter the Great." As for new writers and their works, there are: Kasekvich's "Star," Nikolaeva's "Harvest," Gonchar's "Standard Bearers," Guril's "Sagan's Spring" and many other good works. Many new works increasingly widely reflect the lives of the Soviet people.

Tikhonov believes that the achievements of Soviet literature in recent years have been enormous, but in terms of ideological and artistic level, it should be continuously improved. Because the fact is obvious, although Soviet literary works have made remarkable achievements in portraying the Soviet people; however, the inner life of the people is far richer than what these works have written.

The poet said that the reason for improving writing skills is, of course, to make the works better serve socialism and peace. This goal is immutable. Soviet literature is incompatible with reactionary ideas such as chauvinism, war propaganda, and national discrimination. Soviet writers often regard the working people who build a peaceful and happy society as the protagonists of their works. For example, Pavlenko's "Happiness" is about how people use high labor enthusiasm to revive the Crimean Peninsula. Works like this, on the one hand, write about the qualities of the Soviet people, and on the other hand, they are a eulogy to peaceful labor and a contribution to the cause of world peace. Another type of work is directly exposing the conspiracy of war mongers and inspiring the cause of defending peace, such as Ehrenburg's "Storm" and a novel "Peace Workers" that Pavlenko did not complete before his death.

Tikhonov emphasized that writers must constantly study Marxism-Leninism and study Stalin's works in order to improve their writing skills; writers must not only strengthen their political and ideological cultivation, but also turn them into weapons to describe artistic images and make the protagonists of their works the embodiment of this kind of thought. This experienced old writer believes that the latter is a more important part of the work for a writer, but the former is a prerequisite, because, as he incisively said: "If a writer wants to truly write well about a Communist, he himself must first be a person who is truly armed with Communist ideology and strives for the cause of Communism."

This leader of the Soviet Writers' Association also mentioned how to help young writers. The Moscow Soviet Writers' Association and its branches in various states, autonomous republics, and union republics are very concerned about cultivating young writers. They often discuss the works submitted by young people and provide guidance. In addition, there are also specialized colleges: such as the Gorky Literary Institute, which specializes in training literary talents. Tikhonov said that in the Soviet Union, no young literary worker would say that he cannot get people's help, so he has no future. Since the establishment of the Writers' Association in 1934, when Gorky was still there, until now, a lot of work has been done in this area. Many examples can be cited to show that young people have no insurmountable difficulties. But, on the other hand, old writers must constantly advise young people not to be arrogant and complacent, not to forget that they must constantly increase their experience, broaden their horizons, understand people's lives, and constantly improve the ideological and artistic level of their works.

When reporters mentioned the issue of poetry, the poet said that this is a particularly interesting but by no means simple issue. He said that poetry is the best form of language; poetry is like a crystal; it summarizes a lot of things with very few things. Although the poems of various countries are different, they have one thing in common, that is, the poems must have real feelings. If a national hero is praised in the poem, people must really feel that he is indeed a hero; if love is described, people must feel that the protagonist really has ardent love, and it cannot be written without energy. Regarding form, he advocated that poetry should have a national form, but at the same time, he opposed formalism. Regarding content, he used Soviet poetry as an example. He said that Soviet poetry is revolutionary poetry, but revolutionary poetry is by no means poetry with a narrow theme. The themes described by Soviet poets are extremely broad and rich. They never exclude themes such as love, friendship, women, and children from their poems. However, the problem is not only in the choice of themes, but more importantly: how to express them. In this respect and in terms of themes, Soviet poets have their own styles. Mayakovsky is unique, unlike any other poet; Tvardovsky is not like Schipachov; Simonov is not like Tvardovsky; Surkov is not like Inber; he himself is not like Surkov; Isakovsky's poems can often be set to music and sung, which is different from other poets. But no matter how different they are, they all have a common goal, which goes without saying. Finally, Tikhonov earnestly expressed his willingness to understand the situation of Chinese poetry creation, and he hoped to have another time to talk with Chinese poets.

The day before the reporters visited the poet, he and other artist representatives had just visited the Temple of Heaven and the Summer Palace, famous scenic spots in China. He said that he used to love history and geography, so he had already seen photos of these scenic spots from some illustrated books, and he also knew how the Old Summer Palace was burned down, but now he saw them with his own eyes. He would like to have more time to appreciate Chinese sculpture and painting. When he visited these buildings, his first feeling was: to admire the genius of Chinese craftsmen, that is, the wisdom and strength of the Chinese working people. He said that Empress Dowager Cixi herself did not exert any effort here, "she did not plant a tree or dig a shovel of soil, these are all the creations of the people." He said that he, like the Chinese people, felt extremely excited that these great works of art have become the wealth of the people.

Finally, this leader of the friendship mission representing the Soviet people talked about the friendly relations between the two countries. He expected that Sino-Soviet friendship would inevitably be increasingly consolidated and developed, because this friendship is cordial and natural. He strengthened his passionate language with powerful gestures: "During the war, we had a fighting friendship; in peacetime, we had a friendship working together for peace and happiness. Whether in difficult years or in happy days, our firm friendship will stand any test."

    访卓越的和平战士—诗人吉洪诺夫
    袁水拍
    出现在记者们面前的是，一个银色头发的、有着健康的微红脸色的魁梧的老人，突出的眉骨下闪着明澈的目光，有力的下颚和露着刚毅表情的嘴角，都使人联想到一座出自雕刻家之手的坚强无畏的英雄的头像。
    实际也的确这样，苏联著名诗人、不懈不倦的世界和平的保卫者、此次来我国参加“中苏友好月”活动的苏联文化工作者代表团团长尼古拉·谢明诺维奇·吉洪诺夫，是一个走过了暴风雨般的、长久的斗争历史、有着卓越战绩的老战士。
    在内战时期，红军战士吉洪诺夫参加了击溃国内外敌人的革命战争。内战结束后，由于社会主义经济文化建设的蓬勃发展，新的苏联文学天才纷纷涌现，吉洪诺夫就是这些青年作家当中的一个。他成为从二十年代起即为苏联读者所爱好的、继高尔基和马雅科夫斯基的事业的苏联卓越诗人之一。他先后荣获三次斯大林文艺奖金。
    在伟大卫国战争时期，他以勇敢坚毅著称，他运用文学武器参加了保卫列宁格勒的斗争。最近三年来，他以苏联拥护和平委员会主席和世界和平理事会理事的身份，数十次地代表苏联人民，在他本国的以及法国、意大利、德国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、巴基斯坦等国的和平讲台上，热情地号召世界人民为和平而斗争。同时他还担任苏联最高苏维埃代表和苏联作家协会副总书记的职务。繁忙紧张的社会活动和丰富的创作事业密切结合着。
    这位衣襟上闪耀着许多勋章，包括列宁勋章、斯大林奖章、红旗勋章……的老战士，今年已经五十五岁了，但在记者们面前，他还是显得那样健壮和精力充沛。他不厌其详地、以两小时四十分钟的长时间来答复记者们所提的问题。
    首先，吉洪诺夫同志回答记者们关于此次来到中国的最初印象。他说，全体代表都还是第一次到中国来。过去只是从书籍报刊上对中国得到一些了解，这次有机会亲眼看到中国，代表们都很高兴。当火车越过边境，进入中国国界时，大家非常兴奋。他们长久地从车窗口了望中国的土地。他说：“即使通过小小的窗口，也使我们看到了新中国的多种多样的丰富生活。……到处是热烈的欢迎和友谊的接待，在到达北京车站的时候，更达到了沸点，这一切将使我们终身难忘。”他又说，从一路上所受到的热烈欢迎中，他更加深刻地感觉到中苏两国之间的友谊是多么真诚和伟大；同时，他也体会到，所有欢迎群众之伟大；所以那样健康和愉快，是由于他们获得了解放之故。诗人愉快地微笑着告诉记者们说，从青年、妇女、儿童的歌唱和舞蹈中，他看出了，他们是有着无限光明前途的人民，“未来为他们而开放”。
    吉洪诺夫表示，这些仅仅是最初的印象，总的印象要等待代表团在中国的活动结束以后来说。代表们将到中国各地去参加许多活动，用他自己的有趣的话来说，就是：他们之中，能唱的就唱，能演的就演，能跳的就跳。不能唱、不能演、不能跳的，也要各按专业来做别的许多工作。农学家要会见中国的农学家，音乐家要和中国的音乐院学生举行座谈会，历史家将访问重要的历史事实发生的地点，他本人也要和中国的文化界文艺界交换意见。他们都将参加许多座谈会，出席许多报告会。总之，吉洪诺夫说，过去只是从书本上知道中国，现在将亲身了解中国，这是莫大兴奋的事。
    接着，记者们要求他先谈谈自己的著作，特别是三次荣获斯大林奖金的诗作。在这一方面，诗人谦逊地只简单地说了一下，但是全世界读者包括中国的在内，都知道，这些作品是闪烁着光辉的艺术天才和具有崇高价值的。苏联的批评家在论述这些作品的时候，对作者作了这样充满敬意的描写：他“集中了苏维埃知识分子的最优美的品质：对当前时代重要事业的敏感，政治家的广阔的胸襟和成熟的思想，把自己的力量、才能贡献给人民的忠诚愿望，真正的人道主义和高贵的爱国主义”。（见“苏联文学”本年三月号克尼波维支的论文）
    的确，在可敬的诗人吉洪诺夫的作品中，是充满着这些优美的思想感情的。
    他的第一次获得斯大林奖金的诗作是以“基洛夫和我们同在”（中译载林陵等译“苏联卫国战争诗选”）为主的、一九四一年所作的一些诗篇。这首长诗描写英勇人民怎样百折不挠地抗击德寇，保卫列宁格勒；诗中，作者假想列宁格勒工人的亲爱领袖、于一九三四年遭敌人暗杀的基洛夫，怎样夜出巡游。当列宁格勒人感到伟大领袖和他们在一起作战时，更加勇气百倍，斗志旺盛。
    诗人告诉我们：“这首诗的内容和当时的实际是毫无不同的。写作的时候，空袭的轰炸声，炮弹的啸声正在周围响着，弹片四处飞着。列宁格勒正经历着最艰苦的围城的岁月，但无比英勇的红军和爱国人民是那样地充满着胜利的信心，他们促使我不能不写出这首诗来。”这句话说得虽则很简单，但诗人已告诉我们这首诗的成功的根本原因。
    当时吉洪诺夫曾到工厂中去朗诵这个作品。法捷耶夫描写那次的朗诵说：“诗本身的美丽，加上作者是在一个残酷的冬天，在一所寒冷的房间里，就着摇曳的烛光所创作的这一事实，再加上诗人亲自在一座正在被猛烈炮火轰击的工厂的地下室中，向工人们朗诵的这一事实，就更增加了诗的力量。听众倾听得入了神，一动也不动，满场是专注的严肃的脸容。”（这段引文也摘自上述克尼波维支论文）当读到诗的某些部分时，男女工人们的脸颊上，淌着泪水；当读完全诗的时候，听众更热烈地鼓掌高呼。基洛夫的庄严形象是如此动人地出现在诗中：
    炸弹在聂瓦河上唿哨，
    卷起烈火焚烧桥梁。
    不顾午夜的空中袭击。
    冒着半夜炮声怒号，
    在列宁格勒铁的黑夜，
    基洛夫在满城巡哨。
    穿着军人的行军外套，
    宛似在军队的前方，
    ………
    制帽上星徽发着红光，
    炯炯目光火样燃烧，
    ……
    他骄矜的心十分欣喜，
    人民这样不折不挠，
    ………
    这是一首革命的浪漫主义和现实主义相结合的诗，从这里，任何读者都会感受到作者的强烈的爱国热情。这首诗立刻被苏联读者所爱好，并在人民中广泛流传，成为卫国战争时代的卓越的文学著作之一。
    第二次获得奖金的诗集名“格鲁吉亚的春天”。格鲁吉亚的美丽景色特别吸引诗人，在他的早期诗歌中，这个主题就已经出现。那儿的葡萄园农民、牧羊人、猎人是他作品中的主角。他和格鲁吉亚人民有着深厚友谊，他译了不少他们的民族诗歌，他是格鲁吉亚文化的权威学者。他兴奋地说，斯大林的故乡就是格鲁吉亚的哥里城。在诗人的得奖诗集中，大部分是关于格鲁吉亚人民在战后从事大规模的水电站等和平建设的题材，而这些建设的背景是格鲁吉亚的充满阳光的田野、美丽的古老的山川。对苏联人民生活所发出的温暖的抒情的歌颂，吸引着诗的读者。
    一九五○年作者出席华沙和平大会。在会上，他即席写了关于波兰儿童献花给中国代表团的诗；并亲将此诗作为礼物送给中国代表团。作者以朴素的、然而有着丰富含义的、美妙的句子描写了中国已经历尽艰辛而获得解放，中国人民已经站立起来，光荣地出现在世界各国面前（这首诗已由刘群译出，载一九五一年一月七日本报）：
    有这样的事情呢：重重艰难都已过去，
    好像一行简单的句子在你眼前飞扬；
    我真的亲眼看见：孩子的轻柔的手，
    抚摩在中国的肩膀上。
    这首诗以及其他描写和平大会的八篇诗，合成了“在第二届世界和平大会上”组诗；连同作者在一九四九年访问巴基斯坦、阿富汗后所发表的组诗“两道巨流”，由于它们的真挚而崇高的爱国主义和国际主义思想感情和对殖民地人民的民族解放斗争的鼓舞作用，一同获得了去年的斯大林文艺奖金。
    诗人的热情的谈话继续着，题目从他个人的文学创作转到了战后苏联文学的情况。但由于时间的关系，他只能作一个扼要的概述：
    苏联作家在战后扩大了自己的队伍，一批又一批新的作家参加了行列。在战前他们还年轻，作品不够成熟，经过了战争的锻炼和考验，开始写出了出色的作品。老作家也在这个时期重新获得了写作时间，纷纷完成他们未竟的创作。例如费定完成了反映内战时期人民生活的“不平凡的夏天”，阿·托尔斯泰续写了“彼得一世”。至于新作家和他们的作品，有：卡塞克维支的“星”、尼古拉也娃的“收获”、冈察尔的“旗手”、古里尔的“萨根的春天”等许多好作品。许多新作品日益广泛地反映了苏联人民的生活。
    吉洪诺夫认为近年来苏联文学的成就是巨大的，但在思想艺术水平方面，还应该不断地提高。因为事实很明显，虽则苏联文学作品在刻划苏联人民方面已卓有成绩；但是，人民的内在生活却远较这些作品所写出来的要丰富。
    诗人说，所以要提高写作水平，当然是为了要使作品更好地为社会主义与和平服务。这个目标是不可移易的。苏联文学与沙文主义、战争宣传、民族歧视等反动思想是不相容的。苏联作家经常把建设和平幸福社会的劳动人民作为自己作品的主人公。例如，巴甫连柯的“幸福”，就是写人们怎样以高度的劳动热情来复兴克里米亚半岛。像这一类作品，一方面写出了苏联人的品质，一方面也就是对和平劳动作了歌颂，对世界和平事业作了贡献。另一类作品是直接揭露战争贩子的阴谋，鼓舞保卫和平事业的，例如爱伦堡的“暴风雨”，以及巴甫连柯生前所没有完成的一部小说“和平工作者”等。
    吉洪诺夫着重地指出：作家要提高写作水平，必须不懈地学习马克思列宁主义，学习斯大林的著作；作家不但要加强政治思想的修养，还必须把它们变为武器，来描写艺术形象，使作品的主人公成为这种思想的体现者。这位富有经验的老作家认为，对于一个作家说来，后者是更重要的一部分工作，但前者是先决问题，因为，他精辟地说道：“作家要想真正写好一个共产党员，他自己首先必须是一个真正以共产主义思想武装起来，并为共产主义事业而奋斗的人。”
    这位苏联作家协会领导人之一又连带说到了怎样帮助青年作家的问题。莫斯科苏联作家协会及其在各州、各自治共和国、加盟共和国所设的分会，都非常关心地培养青年作家。他们经常讨论青年所投寄的作品，加以指导。此外还有专门的学院：如高尔基文艺学院，专门造就文艺人才。吉洪诺夫说，在苏联，决没有一个青年文学工作者会说，他得不到人们的帮助，因此他没有前途。作家协会从一九三四年成立起，那时候高尔基还在，直到现在，在这方面已做了不少工作。可以举出许多例子，说明青年们是没有克服不了的困难的。但，另一方面，老作家也要不断告诫青年不要骄傲自满，不要忘记必须经常增长阅历，扩大眼界，了解人民生活，不断提高自己作品的思想和艺术水平。
    当记者们提到了关于诗的问题的时候，诗人说，这是他特别感到有兴趣的、却决不是简单的问题。他说，诗是语言的最好形式；诗好像是一个结晶体一样；它以极少的东西来概括极多的东西。各国的诗纵有不同，却有一个共通点，那就是诗必须有真实的感情。如果在诗中歌颂一个民族英雄，就必须真正使人觉得他确是一个英雄；如果描写恋爱，就必须使人觉得主人公真有热烈的爱情，而不能写得无精打彩。关于形式，他主张诗应该有民族形式，但同时要反对形式主义。关于内容，他用苏联诗歌为例，他说，苏联的诗歌是革命的诗歌，但革命诗歌决不是题材狭隘的诗歌。苏联诗人所描写的题材是极其广泛的、丰富的，他们决不把爱情、友谊、妇女、儿童……等主题排斥在他们的诗歌之外。不过问题还不仅在题材的选择，更重要的是：怎样来表现它们。在这一方面以及在题材方面，苏联诗人各有各的风格。马雅科夫斯基是独特的，不像任何别的诗人；特伐尔陀夫斯基不像史起巴巧夫；西蒙诺夫不像特伐尔陀夫斯基；苏尔柯夫不像英倍尔；他自己又不像苏尔柯夫；依萨柯夫斯基的诗常常能够配上曲谱来唱，和别的诗人又不同。但不论他们怎样不同，都有一个共同的目标，那是不待说明的。末了，吉洪诺夫殷切地表示愿意了解中国的诗歌创作的情况，他希望有另外的时间能和中国诗人交谈。
    在记者访问诗人的前一天，他和别的艺术家代表们刚游览了我国名胜天坛和颐和园。他说他曾经爱好过历史和地理，因此从一些有插图的书本上，已经看到过这些名胜的照片，也知道圆明园怎样被烧毁，但现在亲眼看到了它们。他很愿意有更多的时间来欣赏中国的雕刻和绘画。在参观了这些建筑的时候，他的第一个感觉是：钦佩中国的工匠的天才，也就是中国的劳动人民的智慧和力量。他说，慈禧本人在这里没有使过一点力气，“她既没有栽一棵树，也没有挖一锹土，这些全是人民的创造”。他说，他和中国人民一样，为了这些伟大艺术品已经变成了人民的财富而感到极大的兴奋。
    最后，这位代表着苏联人民的友谊使节的领导人谈到了关于两国之间的友好关系。他预期中苏友谊必然日益巩固和发展，因为这个友谊是亲切的、自然的。他用有力的手势加强着他的热情的语言：“在战争时期，我们有着战斗的友谊；在和平时期，我们有着共同为和平幸福而努力的友谊。不论在艰难的岁月，还是在幸福的日子，我们的牢固的友情将经得起任何的考验。”
