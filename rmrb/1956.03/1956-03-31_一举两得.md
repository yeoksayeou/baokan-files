The supply and marketing cooperatives of Hangxian County and Xiaoshan County in Zhejiang Province, based on the new situation of centralized supply of means of production in rural areas after cooperation, adopted the method of direct transportation in the process of supplying fertilizers. In the past, after the supply and marketing cooperatives purchased fertilizers, they had to transport a large amount of fertilizer from the place of origin to the supply and marketing cooperatives, and then sell them through the sales department. Now, they contact the units requiring goods in advance, determine the quantity, type, delivery time, and unloading location of the goods to be transported according to the annual demand plan, and then transport the fertilizer directly from the place of origin to the various agricultural production cooperatives and farms. The transportation costs are reasonably shared by the supply and marketing cooperatives and the units requiring goods.

After implementing this method, the supply and marketing cooperatives reduced commodity circulation costs, accelerated capital turnover, and also facilitated production units. Agricultural production cooperatives and farms received fertilizers two to three days earlier than in the past. They also don't need to send special personnel to purchase and transport fertilizers. Some agricultural cooperative cadres said: In the future, as long as we prepare the demand plan, the supply and marketing cooperative can deliver the fertilizer to our door, and we can use the saved labor for production.

    一举两得
    浙江省杭县和萧山县的供销合作社，根据合作化后农村生产资料供应集中的新情况，在供应肥料过程中采用了直达运输的方法。过去，供销合作社采购肥料以后，要从货源地把大量肥料运到供销合作社，然后再通过门市部销售出去。现在，他们事先同各要货单位联系好，根据年度要货计划，把运货的数量、种类、交货时间和卸货地点等都确定，然后就把肥料从货源地直接运到各个农业生产合作社和农场去。运输过程中的费用由供销合作社和要货单位合理分摊。
    实行这个方法以后，供销合作社减少了商品流转费用，加速了资金周转，也便利了生产单位。农业生产合作社和农场拿到肥料的时间比过去提早了两天到三天。也不需要派出专人去采购和运输肥料了。有些农业合作社干部说：今后只要编好要货计划，供销合作社就可以把肥料送到门口，我们就可以把节省的劳动力用在生产上去。
