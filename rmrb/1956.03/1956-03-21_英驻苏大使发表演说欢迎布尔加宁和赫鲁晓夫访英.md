Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 20th: Britain is awaiting the upcoming visit of Bulganin and Khrushchev with great interest, according to TASS. The visit schedule has been carefully arranged to allow time for serious discussions between the Soviet leaders and the British government. This was stated by the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir William Hayter, on a television program in Moscow on March 19th.

Hayter said that there are many topics to discuss. It would be futile to say that there are not many issues on which the British and Soviet governments disagree. However, serious discussions can lead to good progress on the road to resolving these issues. This is all the more hopeful since, on many of these issues, the two countries differ more in method than in objective.

Hayter gave an example: Both governments agree on the need for disarmament, they simply have different views on what is the best way to achieve it. Both governments want to see a relaxation of international tensions, but they have different ideas about what they can do or avoid doing to achieve this goal. However, Hayter said, "The British government and people, like the Soviet government and people, believe that maintaining peace is the most fundamental interest of mankind. On this point, we have no disagreement."

Hayter said that if the upcoming visit can contribute to the promotion of these goals, then the visit is worthwhile for that reason alone.

Hayter also expressed the hope that Bulganin and Khrushchev would not be the only Soviet guests to visit Britain. He went on to express the hope of seeing not only visits by organized delegations, but also by ordinary citizens of both countries.

Hayter said that in the absence of direct contact, cultural exchanges can be very valuable. Recently, cultural exchanges between Britain and the Soviet Union have increased significantly. It has already been agreed in principle to exchange visits by ballet troupes this autumn. He also expressed the hope that the two countries would become more familiar with each other's modern literature.

Hayter concluded by expressing the hope that exchanges of this kind could increase, and that Bulganin and Khrushchev's visit to Britain would mark the beginning of a new and better era in Anglo-Soviet relations.

    英驻苏大使发表演说欢迎布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫访英
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：英国正怀着极大的兴趣等待着即将到来的布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫的访问。访问日程已经妥加安排，以便使苏联的领导人和英国政府之间有时间进行认真的讨论。这是英国驻苏联大使海特尔三月十九日在莫斯科的一个电视节目中讲的。
    海特尔说，有很多可以讨论的题目。如果硬说英苏两国政府意见不一致的问题并不多，那是徒劳无益的事。但是，认真的讨论可以导致在解决这些问题的道路上获得良好的进展。由于在许多这种问题上，两国与其说是目标不同倒不如说是方法不同，这就更加有希望了。
    海特尔举例说：两国政府一致认为需要裁军，它们仅仅在什么是实现裁军的最好方法上有不同的意见。两国政府都希望看到国际紧张局势缓和，但是它们在为了达到这个目的而能够做些什么或避免做些什么的问题上有不同的意见。不过，海特尔说：“英国政府和人民正像苏联政府和人民一样，相信维持和平是人类最基本的利益。在这一点上我们没有什么不同的意见。”
    海特尔说，如果即将到来的访问能够对促进这些目标有所贡献，那末单单因为这一点，这次访问就是值得的。
    海特尔还表示希望，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫不是仅有的访问英国的苏联客人。他接着表示希望不仅看到有组织的代表团的访问，而且也看到两国的普通公民的访问。
    海特尔说，在缺少直接的接触的时候，文化交流可以十分有价值。最近，英苏两国之间的文化交流已经大大增加了。已经在原则上同意在今年秋天互派巴蕾舞剧团进行访问。他还表示希望两国能够更加熟悉彼此的现代文学。
    海特尔最后表示希望这一类的交流能够增加，而布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫的访问英国将成为英苏两国关系中的一个新的和更好的时代的开端。
