In the Xuchang Special District of Henan Province, 150 farmers were injured and 20 died in well-digging accidents in less than two months. In order to prevent casualties, the Xuchang Prefectural Party Committee and the Commissioner's Office convened a meeting in early February with more than 500 township and commune cadres and well-digging team members. The purpose of the meeting was to examine and criticize the麻痹 [Mám痹: numb, lack of awareness and alertness] thinking of neglecting safety in well-digging work, to require all townships to formulate measures to ensure the safety of well-digging, to strictly guarantee the solidity of well-digging equipment and tools, and to organize safety inspection teams for inspection tours, and so on. There is no doubt that taking these measures is very necessary.

However, in some other areas, the phenomenon of neglecting safety in farmland water conservancy construction is still very serious. After casualties occurred in these areas, the leading authorities did not take serious and responsible effective measures to eliminate accidents, so the accidents continued to occur.

Since last winter, many areas have made great achievements in agricultural capital construction such as water conservancy construction. However, rural workers in various places should not be overwhelmed by the achievements that have been made. They should help agricultural producers' cooperatives immediately take safety measures to eliminate all casualties.

    打井必须注意安全
    河南省许昌专区不到两个月就有150个农民在打井中负了伤，另外还有20人死亡。为了防止伤亡事故发生，许昌地委和专署曾在2月初召开有500多名乡、社干部和打井队员参加的会议，检查和批判打井工作中忽视安全的麻痹思想，要求各乡制定保证打井安全的办法，严格保证打井的设备和工具的坚固，并组织安全检查小组进行巡回检查，等等。无疑采取这些措施是非常必要的。
    但是，在别的一些地区兴修农田水利工作中忽视安全问题的现象仍然非常严重。这些地区的领导机关在伤亡事故发生后，没有严肃负责地采取杜绝事故的有效措施，因此事故仍在继续发生。
    去冬以来，许多地区在兴修水利等农业基本建设方面，作出了很大的成绩，但是，各地农村工作人员不要被已经取得的成绩冲昏头脑，应该帮助农业生产合作社立即采取安全措施，消灭一切伤亡事故。
