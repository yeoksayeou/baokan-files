    Do Not Discriminate Against and Strike at Amateur Literary Creators
    By Our Newspaper Commentator
    In recent years, many new faces have emerged in our literary ranks. Their excellent works have been loved by the broad masses of readers, and their diligent and fruitful labor has prospered our country's literary undertaking. Thousands of amateur literary creators are scattered in various positions throughout the country, eager to try and willing to display their talents in literary creation. This is originally an exciting and good thing, because our literary creation, no matter from which aspect, is far from meeting the needs of the people, and the people urgently need more and better works. However, the phenomenon of discrimination against and striking at amateur literary creators still exists, which cannot but be taken seriously.
    There is such a kind of person who confuses the enthusiasm of young people in literary creation with individualistic thinking. Thus, in the eyes of these people, all those who engage in creation in their spare time are denounced as "individualism" and "pursuit of fame and gain," and they adopt an attitude of utter detestation. A trade union cadre in Qinghai said: "As soon as we write, they say it is for稿费[稿费: manuscript fee]." A cadre in Shandong said: "I was criticized by the leadership for writing in my spare time, so I wrote secretly. At this meeting, I confessed to writing and was severely scolded by the leader, who said I was getting worse and worse." A young man said: "Because I write in my spare time, I was not only criticized by the leader, but also forced to admit that it was for fame and gain, and it had to be written on the year-end appraisal." Listen to the voices of these young people! Many readers are reaching out to writers from all directions for works, and many young literary creators are willing to write works with honest labor, but they have encountered such treatment!
    Yes, it should be pointed out that some young people do regard literary creation as a personal career, violating the principle of serving the people, and their creative motives are impure; some become arrogant and complacent after writing a few works, detach themselves from the masses, and confront the organization and leadership. These young people should be seriously criticized to help them correct their standpoints and viewpoints. However, it would be a big mistake to label them all as "individualism" and "pursuit of fame and gain" indiscriminately. The problem lies precisely here. Many honest young amateur literary creators are being placed in a very painful situation by unreasonable interference from the leadership or by the cold ridicule from surrounding colleagues.
    There is also another kind of person who sets young people's amateur literary creation against revolutionary work. In the eyes of these people, all those who engage in amateur literary creation are denounced as "not being at ease with their work" and "not attending to their proper duties," and even regarded as "illegal activities." There was a young member of the Communist Youth League in Chongqing who performed well in all aspects, and the leadership was preparing to commend him. Later, they found out that he loved writing, so they did not commend him, because: "Loving writing means he cannot be said to be at ease with his work!" A comrade from a cultural center in Shaanxi said: "Amateur creation is considered an immoral thing, so I had to resolve not to write anymore." Some administrative leaders of agencies even put forward such a reason to oppose legitimate amateur literary creation. They said: "If the time spent on amateur creation is used to study professional work, wouldn't it be better to work?"
    Obviously, this, like the aforementioned vulgar view of young people's enthusiasm for literary creation, shows that these people are viewing the Party's literary undertaking with vulgar eyes. To regard literary creation as "not attending to proper duties" and "an immoral thing," doesn't this show the shortsightedness of these people? Lenin said long ago that the literary undertaking is a part of the proletariat's overall cause. It can be seen that the reason why these people adopt such a discriminatory attitude towards young amateur literary creators is precisely because they do not regard the literary undertaking as a part of the Party's cause, and it is a manifestation of the erroneous idea of vulgarly viewing the literary undertaking.
    The literary undertaking is not just a matter for a few professional writers. The current writers' ranks are too small and need to be strengthened. Where do new writers come from? They can only gradually grow up from many young amateur literary creators.
    There is also such a kind of person who verbally says that they support the new forces of literature and pay attention to new people, but in their actions, they simply do not believe that young people can write good works. A young man sent a manuscript to a person in charge of a literary association, but the person in charge of the literary association did not even look at it and said to others: "I simply do not believe he can write well!" A young man sent a manuscript to a publishing house, but it has not been processed for more than two years because it has not been queued up, because the manuscripts of "famous writers" are processed as soon as possible, and the manuscripts of "famous writers" keep coming, so the nameless young authors can never squeeze in. A young man submitted an article to a newspaper, criticizing a certain "celebrity," and was ridiculed as: "An unknown little person also wants to talk nonsense."
    Since the criticism of "Wenyi Bao" [文艺报:Literary Gazette] for suppressing new forces, the situation has changed greatly, but the above situation is still quite common.
    Of course, this does not mean that we can ignore or blindly praise the amateur creation activities of young literary creators. Haven't we also seen that the vulgar boasting and "forcing growth" methods of treating young authors have led to bad results?
    Due to the lack of knowledge, experience, creative cultivation, etc., the works of young authors may have shortcomings, and we should not cover up their shortcomings. However, strict requirements must be combined with patient help and sincere love. To say that it is not well written before even looking at the manuscript; to put the manuscript aside because the name is not well-known, isn't this a aristocratic master attitude?
    The bad consequences of treating young authors in this way are very obvious, and can only frustrate their courage and confidence in creation.
    It must be pointed out that the broad masses of amateur literary creators are a strong reserve force for our literary ranks, and we should cherish, support, and cultivate them so that they can grow up with full confidence. They should be given serious criticism and education, but absolutely not be discriminated against or struck at! It should be known that discrimination and打击业余文学创作者the consequences of hitting not only put these lovely young comrades at risk of dying young in the literary undertaking, but also cause great losses to the Party's literary undertaking!

    不要歧视和打击业余文学创作者
    本报评论员
    近几年来，我们的文学队伍中涌现出了许多新人，他们的优秀作品得到了广大读者的喜爱，他们的辛勤的有成效的劳动繁荣了我国的文学事业。有数以千计的业余文学创作者，散布在全国的各种岗位上，他们跃跃欲试，愿意在文学创作方面显示才能。这本来是令人兴奋的好事情，因为我们的文学创作无论从哪一方面说都远远不能满足人民的需要，人民迫切地需要更多、更好的作品。但是，歧视和打击业余文学创作者的现象还是存在，这就不能不加以重视了。
    有这样一种人，他们把青年在文学创作上的积极性与个人主义思想混同起来，于是，在这些人的眼中，凡是在业余时间进行创作的都被斥为“个人主义”、“名利思想”，采取深恶痛绝的态度。青海一个工会干部说：“我们一写稿，就说是为了稿费。”山东的一个机关干部说：“我在业余时间写稿被领导批评了，就偷偷的写，在这一次会上我坦白了写稿的事情，被领导狠狠骂了一顿，说我越变越坏了。”有一位青年说：“我因在业余写稿，不仅被领导批评，还硬要我承认是名利思想，要写在年终鉴定上。”听听这些青年的呼声吧！许多读者从四面八方向作家伸出手来要作品，也有许许多多青年文学创作者愿意以诚实的劳动来写作品，却受到了这样的遭遇！
    是的，应该指出：也确实有一些青年把文学创作看成个人事业，违背了为人民服务的原则，在创作动机上不纯；有的写了几篇作品，就骄傲自满，脱离群众，和组织领导对抗。对这些青年应该严肃地进行批评，帮助他们端正立场观点。但是，如果不分皂白，一律扣上“个人主义”、“名利思想”，就会大错特错。问题也正出在这里。有许多诚实的青年业余文学创作者正被来自领导的无理干涉，或来自周围同事的冷嘲热讽，弄到十分痛苦的境地。
    也有另外一种人，他们是把青年的业余文学创作与革命工作对立起来了，在这些人的眼中，凡是进行业余文学创作的人，都被斥为“不安心工作”、“不务正业”，甚至被当成“非法活动”。重庆就有一位青年团员，各方面表现都很好，领导上准备表扬他，后来发现他爱写作，便不表扬了，理由是：“爱写作就不能说他安心工作！”陕西一个文化馆的同志说：“业余创作被认为是不道德的事情，只好决心不写了。”有些机关的行政领导人，甚至提出这样一种理由来反对正当的业余文学创作，他们说：“如果把业余创作的时间都用在钻研业务上，不是会工作得更好吗？”
    显然，这和前面提到的用庸俗的眼光来看待青年们在文学创作上的积极性一样，这些人是用庸俗的眼光来看待党的文学事业的。把文学创作看成是“不务正业”，是“不道德的事情”，难道还不能说明这些人的眼光短小吗？列宁早就说过文学事业是无产阶级总的事业的一部分。可见这些人之所以对青年业余文学创作者采取那样歧视的态度，正是由于没有把文学事业当作党的事业的一部分，正是庸俗地看待文学事业的错误思想的表现。
    文学事业不只是少数专业作家的事情。现在的作家队伍太小了，需要壮大。新的作家从哪里来呢？只能从许许多多的青年业余文学创作者中逐渐成长起来。
      也有这样一种人，他们在口头上也说扶持文学的新生力量，注意新人，而在他们的行动中，却根本不相信青年能写出好作品。有一位青年把一部原稿送给一位文联的负责人看，那位文联的负责人连看也没有看，就对人说：“我根本不相信他能写好！”有一位青年把一部原稿送给一个出版社，两年多没有处理，原因是排队没有排上，因为“名家”的稿子是尽快处理，而“名家”的稿子又源源而来，无名的青年作者就始终挤不上去了。有一位青年给报社投稿，批评了某“名人”，竟被讽刺为：“无名小卒也要高谈阔论。”
    自从批评了“文艺报”压制新生力量以后，情况有很大的改变，但是，像上述的情况还是相当普遍。
    当然这并不是说，我们对于青年文学创作者的业余创作活动，就可以不问不管，甚至盲目捧场。我们不是也看见，由于用庸俗的吹嘘和“拔苗助长”的办法来对待青年作者，以致造成了不好的结果吗？
    青年作者由于知识、经验、创作修养等等方面的不足，他们的作品是可能有缺点的，我们不应该掩盖他们的缺点。但是，严格的要求必须和耐心的帮助、真诚的爱护相结合。原稿还没有看，就说写得不好；名字不响，就把稿子放在一边，这不是贵族老爷式的态度又是什么呢？
    这样对待青年作者的恶果是十分明显的，只能挫折他们创作的勇气和信心。
    必须指出，广大的业余文学创作者是我们的文学队伍的强大后备军，我们应该爱惜、扶助、培养他们，使他们能够信心百倍地成长。对他们应该有严肃的批评和教育，却绝对不可以歧视和打击！要知道，歧视和打击的结果，不仅使这些可爱的青年同志在文学事业上有夭折的危险，而且党的文学事业也要受到很大的损失！
