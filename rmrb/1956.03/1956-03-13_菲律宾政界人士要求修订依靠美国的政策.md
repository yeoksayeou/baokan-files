    Xinhua News Agency, Manila Dispatch: According to an Associated Press report from Manila, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Philippine House of Representatives passed a resolution on March 10 "calling for a re-examination of the country's foreign policy, so as to make the Philippines less dependent on the West."
    The resolution was proposed by Representatives Salvador and Roses of the ruling Nationalist Party. The resolution stated: "It would be in the highest interests of the Philippines if it reduced its dependence on the West and established and developed its relations with neighboring countries." The resolution said: "The Philippines is an Eastern country, and it cannot escape dealing with other Eastern countries, especially those with whom it has had cultural, commercial, and ethnic relations since its birth."
    One congressman said that the resolution is part of a series of "nationalistic" actions planned by the House of Representatives during the current session.
    Xinhua News Agency, Manila Dispatch: The "Manila Chronicle" reported that former Chairman of the Philippine National Economic Council, Montelibano, said in a meeting with journalists on February 28 that the basis of Philippine-United States relations should be revised so that the Philippines can break free from the shackles of American economic interests and allow the Philippines to plan its own economic policies.
    In response to the question of whether the Philippines' foreign policy is subservient to the United States, Montelibano said: "It has always been a subservient policy." He believes that the best illustration of this policy is the Bell Trade Act. He said that the Bell Trade Act is "a great sell-out of our vital economic interests and a disgrace to the American people."
    Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 10th, TASS: Philippine politicians and social figures have recently been increasingly vocal in criticizing the United States' policy toward the Philippines.
    According to an Associated Press reporter in Manila, Manila City Councilor Baredo said on March 9 that the presence of American military advisors and various American economic representatives in the Philippines is "interference in national internal affairs" and "an insult to the Filipino people."

    菲律宾政界人士要求修订依靠美国的政策
    新华社讯　据美联社马尼拉消息：菲律宾众议院外交委员会在3月10日通过了一项决议，“要求重新审查这个国家的外交政策，以使菲律宾较少地依赖西方。”
    这项决议案是执政的国民党的众议员萨尔瓦多和罗赛斯提出的。决议案指出：“如果菲律宾减少了对西方的依赖，并且建立和发展了它同邻国的关系，那么，这将是符合菲律宾的最高利益的。”决议说：“菲律宾是一个东方国家，它不能逃避同其他东方国家打交道，特别是同那些自从它诞生以来就同它们有文化、商业和种族关系的国家打交道。”
    一位众议员说，这项决议案是众议院在目前的会议期间所计划采取的一系列“民族主义的”行动的一部分。
    据新华社讯　马尼拉消息：“马尼拉纪事报”报道，前菲律宾全国经济委员会主席蒙特利班诺在2月28日接见新闻记者时说，应当修改菲律宾和美国关系的基础，以便菲律宾摆脱美国经济利益的束缚，并且让菲律宾策划自己的经济方针。
    蒙特利班诺在答复关于菲律宾的对外政策是否屈从美国这一问题时说：“它一直是屈从的政策。”他认为最能说明这种政策的就是贝尔贸易法。他说，贝尔贸易法是“我们切身的经济利益的大出卖和美国人民的耻辱”。
    新华社据塔斯社纽约10日讯　菲律宾的政界人士和社会人士最近越来越多地发表言论，抨击美国对菲律宾的政策。
    据美联社驻马尼拉记者报道，马尼拉市政府委员巴雷多在3月9日说，美国军事顾问和各种各样的美国经济代表驻在菲律宾是对“国家内政的干涉”和“对菲律宾人的侮辱”。
