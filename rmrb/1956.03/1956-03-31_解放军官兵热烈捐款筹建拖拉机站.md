Xinhua News Agency, March 30th: A donation campaign to raise funds for the construction of thirty tractor stations is being enthusiastically launched in various units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

The troops stationed in the Beijing area plan to donate 3.6 million yuan to build one medium-sized and three small-sized tractor stations. Officers of all units are voluntarily and according to their means enthusiastically donating. A military organization in Beijing completed 250% of its donation plan in two days. The officers and soldiers of a certain PLA company on the Fujian front subscribed an amount that exceeded the original figure by four times. The donation amount of officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the Shanghai Garrison District exceeded the estimated number by more than six times. Officers and soldiers of a certain regiment in Xinjiang donated more than 11,000 yuan in just one day, exceeding the original amount by more than two times.

During this donation campaign to build tractor stations, many moving stories emerged. In the club of a certain military school, a tractor was drawn, and officers and soldiers competed to write their names and the amount of their donations on the tractor. Dong Cuifeng, a deputy platoon-level staff member in a certain unit in Xinjiang, is usually frugal in her daily life. This time, she took the lead in donating 350 yuan voluntarily. Later, she made a detailed calculation of her income and savings, and requested permission to donate another 150 yuan.

    解放军官兵热烈捐款筹建拖拉机站
    据新华社30日讯　筹建三十个拖拉机站的捐献运动，正在中国人民解放军各部队中热烈展开。
    驻北京地区的部队准备捐款360万元，用来建设一个中型的、三个小型的拖拉机站。各部队的军官们正在自愿、量力的原则下踊跃捐款。北京一个军事机关在两天内完成捐献计划250％。在福建前线的解放军某连官兵认捐金额超过原定数字四倍。上海警备区某单位官兵捐款额超过了预计数六倍以上。新疆某团官兵仅一天的时间就捐献了一万一千多元，超过原定数额两倍多。
    在这次筹建拖拉机站的捐献运动中，出现了许多动人事迹。某军事学校的俱乐部里画了一台拖拉机，官兵们争先把自己的名字和认捐数目写在拖拉机上面。新疆某部一个副排级职员董翠凤，平日生活节俭，这次她自动带头捐献了350元，后来又把自己的收入和存款作了细算，再要求准许认捐150元。
