Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Former British Labour Party leader Attlee said on the evening of the 21st that if a hydrogen bomb war were to break out, it would effectively eliminate Britain "as a fighting force," and would probably also effectively eliminate Britain "as an economic force." He said: "We must face the fact of what the situation would be in the event of a major war. We must never allow a major war to break out."

Attlee made these remarks during a debate on defense issues in the British House of Lords. In his speech, he also advocated that at a time when "the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is very weak," some kind of "British Commonwealth police force" should be established in order to send it to intervene in the affairs of "any part of the world."

    艾德礼说氢弹战争将毁灭英国
    据新华社讯　前英国工党领袖艾德礼二十一日晚上说，如果爆发氢弹战争，就一定会有效地消灭“作为一个战斗力量”的英国，而且大概也会有效地消灭“作为一个经济力量”的英国。他说：“我们必须正视这个事实，那就是发生大战的时候的情况。我们绝不能让大战爆发。”
    艾德礼是在英国议会上院辩论防务问题的时候说这些话的。他在发言里又主张，在目前“北大西洋公约组织非常软弱”的时候，应该建立某种“英联邦警察部队”，以便派出去干涉“世界任何部分”的事务。
