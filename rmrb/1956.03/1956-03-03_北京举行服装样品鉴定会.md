    Beijing Holds Clothing Sample Appraisal Meeting

    An engaging clothing sample appraisal meeting was held one day at the Beijing Department Store's club.

    On display were over 400 types of novel women's, children's, and men's clothing samples, the vast majority of which were newly designed. Among them, the various colored qipaos, small jackets, pleated skirts, plain light-colored seersucker dresses, and shirts were the samples that most pleased the visitors. The samples were mostly spring clothing made from various silks, woolens, poplins, gauze, crepe, and printed fabrics suitable for the season.

    More than a dozen female commentators wearing beautiful and well-fitting clothes attracted much attention at the appraisal meeting. They carefully introduced the styles, materials, prices, and production characteristics of the clothes they were wearing to groups of young women.

    At the appraisal meeting, staff from units such as the Beijing Department Store took many visitors' measurements and organized discussion groups. They will quickly process and produce clothing according to everyone's opinions on clothing styles, colors, and sizes.

    北京举行服装样品鉴定会
    北京的百货大楼的俱乐部里，一日举行了一个吸引人的服装样品鉴定会。
    陈列着的400多种新颖的妇女、儿童和男子服装样品，极大部分都是新设计出来的。其中各色的旗袍、小夹袄、带有摺纹的裙子、素浅色泡泡纱的布拉吉和衬衫等样品，最使参观者感到满意。样品大多数是用各种绸缎、呢绒、府绸、纱、绉和花布等制做的应季春装。
    鉴定会上十多个穿着漂亮而合身服装的女讲解员很受大家注意，她们仔细地向一群群年轻姑娘介绍自己穿的服装的样式、质料、价格和制作特点。
    在鉴定会上，北京市百货公司等单位的工作人员量了许多参观者的身材，并且组织观众座谈，他们将按照大家对服装样式、花色，身材的大小等方面的意见，很快地加工生产。
