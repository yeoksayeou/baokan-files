    A Batch of Female Agricultural Technicians in Zhejiang Participate in Spring Plowing
    Basic-level supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural technology departments in various parts of Zhejiang have trained a large number of female agricultural technicians. According to incomplete statistics up to mid-February, agricultural producers' cooperatives in various areas already have more than 1,200 female agricultural technicians capable of operating double-wheel double-铧 plows. This group of female agricultural technicians has become an important force in spring plowing production. The Longshan Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Xinle Township, Yin County, has organized 408 women to use new-style farm tools and established 66 women's rice threshing teams to operate threshing machines in preparation for participating in this year's double-cropping rice harvest.
    Currently, there are still thousands of women in the province actively learning operational techniques in new-style farm tool training classes and they will soon be able to put them into spring plowing production work.

    浙江一批女农具手参加春耕
    浙江各地基层供销合作社和农业技术部门训练了大批女农具手。据至2月中旬不完全的统计，各地农业生产合作社已有1，200多名能操作双轮双铧犁的女农具手，这批女农具手已成为春耕生产中的重要力量。鄞县新乐乡龙山农业生产合作社已组织了408个妇女使用新式农具，成立了66个妇女打稻队，操作打稻机准备参加今年连作稻的收割工作。
    目前，全省还有几千名妇女在新式农具训练班中积极学习操作技术，不久便可以投入春耕生产工作。
