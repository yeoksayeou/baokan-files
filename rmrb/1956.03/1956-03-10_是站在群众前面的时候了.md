Inspired by the new situation of the socialist revolution across the country, some enterprises in Wuhan have launched plant-level, inter-plant, and same-trade competitions centered on completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. A total of 162 youth classes (groups) in the city's enterprises have signed competition agreements. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau has made plans to strive for the early completion of the railway and highway bridges. Advanced producers Engineer Hu Ren and Squad Leader Shi Jingren improved the nozzle of the suction pipe, increasing the suction efficiency from more than 30 cubic meters per shift to more than 70 cubic meters. The youth drilling team implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts, improved the operation methods, created a new record of drilling a hole in 27 hours, increased efficiency by more than three times, and ensured quality. The Wuchang Vehicle Manufacturing Factory formulated a comprehensive plan to complete the Five-Year Plan one year and two months ahead of schedule. Forging workers Wang Zhenqing and Zhang Yipin in the forging workshop boldly innovated technology, created and improved production tools, increasing production efficiency by fifty times. Their pioneering spirit inspired all the workers in the factory. In late February, 91.5% of the workers in the factory's five workshops broke through the current labor quotas while ensuring quality. State-owned Cotton Factory No. 1 plans to increase production by 1,388 bales of yarn this year compared to the state plan. In order to realize the plan, the workers put forward more than 60 rationalization proposals, a quarter of which were proposed by departments that had not previously made rationalization proposals. The Dai Libin Youth Shock Team of the No. 8 Engineering Department of Central South China has continuously put forward four proposals in the past five months, increasing the bricklaying efficiency from more than 1,000 bricks to more than 3,000 bricks, exceeding the central government's labor quota by more than double. With the help of this team, the Chen Meisheng team, which originally only reached about 80% of the quota, has now exceeded the quota by 20%. A production upsurge is also taking shape in the joint state-private owned Kaiming Machine Factory, the joint state-private owned Minjian Machine Factory, and the Hubei Farm Implement Factory.

The broad masses of workers and engineering technicians have waged fierce struggles against conservative ideas in the production movement. When the fitters group of the second workshop of the Wuhan Power Machine Factory formulated a plan, they proposed 16 technical improvement measures, which would increase work efficiency by 1 to 9 times respectively. However, a seventh-grade veteran stubbornly planned the work that could be completed in 40 minutes to be done in one hour, so fourth-grade technician Zhu Xingfang used the facts to criticize his conservative ideas. Veteran Chen Huacai believed that the lead pouring time for the 90-horsepower gas engine bearing could not be shortened to 10 minutes, so Zhang Afu went to demonstrate it to him. The technology section did not believe that their plan could be realized and did not help them make tools, so they found scrap materials to make them themselves. The tenacious struggle of this group ensured the realization of various technical measures. They have already started working on the second quarter on February 15th. The leaders of the Nanyang Cigarette Factory believed that the production potential had been exhausted, and that to complete the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule, it was necessary to increase workers and equipment, so they hesitated to issue targets to the workshop groups. However, the planned targets were immediately broken by the workers after they were issued. When the workers asked the leadership to organize a large number of mutual teaching and learning contracts in order to learn from the advanced, improve technology, and better complete the plan, the trade union was afraid of not being able to control it and only organized 5 mutual teaching and learning contracts. However, the workers organized more than 80 mutual teaching and learning contracts themselves. After the conservative ideas of the leading staff were criticized by many vivid facts, they went deep into the workshops to jointly explore the production potential with the workers and engineering technicians. The results proved that the Five-Year Plan could be completed one year and seven months ahead of schedule.

The struggle between advanced ideas and conservative ideas is not always one where advanced ideas prevail in all enterprises in Wuhan. A large number of enterprise leaders still do not see the socialist consciousness, wisdom and strength of the masses, and follow old routines. Some leaders do not want to make plans at all, but are afraid of being criticized, so they make very advanced long-term plans, but do not have current plans; or they make current plans very advanced, but do not have specific measures. As a result, the enthusiasm of the workers is very high, but they do not know how to do it. Some leaders do not consult with the masses when making plans, but close themselves off and make them behind closed doors. For example, the director of the Comprehensive Woodworking Factory sat in the office and wrote a plan for half a month, which not only ordinary workers did not know, but even the deputy director and the party branch committee members did not know. It is not difficult to imagine that such a plan cannot guide the work. Some leaders always pass the plan around among the cadres after it is formulated, without meeting with the masses. Some administrative leaders do not actively support and lead the competition movement, saying that it is a matter for the trade union. Some enterprises do not pay much attention to the rationalization proposals of the workers. The Universe Cigarette Factory stipulates that rationalization proposals must be filled out on a form, which has many cumbersome items that the workers cannot fill out. The trade union once helped the workers sort out 47 rationalization proposals, but the administrative leaders said: It doesn't count if it is not filled out on the form according to the regulations. The workers are most familiar with their own work, and many people make rationalization proposals for their own work. However, some leaders have opinions on workers making rationalization proposals for their own work, saying: "It doesn't count to make rationalization proposals for your own work, you should make rationalization proposals for other people's work to be considered capable." Once, worker Zhang Yupeng made a rationalization proposal to save tobacco, which is difficult to implement at present, but the worker's enthusiasm for making proposals is very good and should be warmly welcomed. A leader coldly said: "You have nothing to do, you just look for trouble." The leaders treat rationalization proposals with such a bureaucratic attitude, and the workers' morale is low, and fewer and fewer rationalization proposals are made. Last year, 50 rationalization proposals were made (which have not been dealt with yet), only two were made in January this year, and none were made in February. The rationalization proposal organization organized by the trade union in Wuhan Power Machine Factory did not dare to be open. They said: "If the organization is open, it is estimated that there will be many rationalization proposals, and we will not be able to cope with it." The imperfect rationalization proposal organization and the lack of responsible personnel are a common phenomenon in some enterprises. Some enterprises talk a lot about promoting advanced experience, but actually do very poorly. The sticking team of Factory 203 comprehensively and evenly completed the plan for 36 months, and the youth class (group) of Factory 209 comprehensively and evenly completed the plan for 24 months. This is worthy of great promotion. However, some leaders in these two factories believe that promoting advanced experience cannot solve any problems, or that promoting advanced experience will hinder the current work, so they have not done a good job in promoting it. The planning management, material supply and other organizational leadership work in some units always cannot keep up with the needs of the work. The plan for February of the Central South China First Engineering Company was not issued to the grassroots units until February 18, and the workers were very dissatisfied. The material supply work of the Central South China Second Engineering Company was done very poorly. Some grassroots units started the competition in the morning and stopped work waiting for materials in the afternoon. Some basic construction units are seriously affected by the failure to produce design drawings.

Due to the conservative ideas of the leadership and the various shortcomings of the work, although the production enthusiasm of the masses is unprecedentedly high, the plan is completed very unevenly. In January, although the city's industrial production units completed the plan, many units did not complete the total output value, output, labor productivity plan and technical and economic indicators; the phenomenon of rushing to complete tasks at the beginning, middle and end of the month still exists. The completion of the plan in basic construction and industrial production units in February was also not very good. For example, Wuhan Iron and Steel Company only completed 33.8% of the monthly plan, Heavy Machine Tool Factory only completed 22.5% of the monthly plan by mid-February, and Meat Union Processing Factory only completed 16.7% of the monthly plan by mid-February.

Overcoming the right-leaning conservative ideas of enterprise leaders is the key to further promoting Wuhan's production to a new upsurge. In late February, Wuhan held the Third Labor Model Representative Conference. The conference commended the advanced, set up banners, exchanged experience, and criticized conservative ideas. Many enterprises launched inter-factory competitions and same-trade competitions. The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China called on leaders at all levels to quickly implement the spirit of the Labor Model Representative Conference. We believe that the leaders of all enterprises in Wuhan will further criticize conservative ideas, stand in front of the masses, guide the masses forward, and must do so.

    是站在群众前面的时候了
    维进  张碨
    在全国社会主义革命新形势的鼓舞下，武汉市有些企业单位开展了以提前完成五年计划为中心的厂内竞赛、厂际竞赛和同工种竞赛。全市企业单位有162个青年班（组）签了竞赛协议书。武汉长江大桥工程局做出了争取提早建成铁路桥和公路桥的规划。先进生产者胡仁工程师和石景仁中队长改进吸泥管的嘴，使吸泥效率由每班吸30多立方公尺提高到70多立方公尺。青年钻机小组贯彻执行苏联专家建议，改进了操作方法，创造了27小时钻一个孔的新纪录，提高效率三倍多，并且保证了质量。武昌车辆制造工厂制定了提前一年另二个月完成五年计划的全面规划。锻冶车间锻工王振清、张怡品大胆地革新技术，创造和改进生产工具，使生产效率提高五十倍。他们的首创精神鼓舞了全厂职工，2月下旬，这个厂的五个车间有91.5％的工人在保证质量的条件下，突破了现行的工时定额。国棉一厂今年规划较国家计划增产1，388件纱。职工为了实现规划，提出合理化建议60多条，其中有四分之一是过去没有提过合理化建议的科室提的。中南第八工程处戴礼彬泥工青年突击队，五个月来连续提出四次倡议，把砌砖效率由1，000多块提高到3，000多块，超过中央规定的劳动定额一倍以上。在这个队的帮助下，原来只达到定额80％左右的陈梅生小组，已经超过定额20％。公私合营开明机器厂、公私合营民建机器厂、湖北农具厂的生产热潮也正在形成。
    广大职工和工程技术人员在生产运动中跟保守思想进行了激烈斗争。武汉动力机厂金工车间二工段钳工组制定规划的时候，提出16项技术改进措施，工效将分别提高1—9倍。但是，一个七级老师傅硬把40分钟能完成的工作物计划定为一小时，四级技工朱星芳就拿出事实来批判他的保守思想。老师傅陈华才认为90匹马力煤气机轴承浇铅工时不能缩短到10分钟，张阿甫就去表演给他看。工艺科不相信他们的规划可以实现，不帮助他们做工具，他们就自己找废料来做。这个小组的顽强斗争的精神，保证了各种技术措施的实现。他们在2月15日已经开始做第二季度的工作了。南洋烟厂的领导人员认为生产潜力已经挖尽，要提前一年完成五年计划，就必须增加工人和设备，因而迟迟不给车间小组下指标。但是，当计划指标下达后，立即被工人们突破。当工人们为了向先进学习，提高技术，更好地完成计划，要求领导上大量组织互教互学合同的时候，工会却害怕掌握不住，只组织了5个互教互学合同。而工人们却自己组织了80多个互教互学合同。领导工作人员在保守思想被许多活生生的事实批判以后，才深入车间同工人、工程技术人员共同挖掘生产潜力，结果证明可以提前一年零七个月完成五年计划。
    先进思想跟保守思想的斗争，在武汉市所有企业中，并不都是先进思想占了优势的。还有很大一部分企业单位的领导人员看不到群众的社会主义觉悟，看不到群众的智慧和力量，按陈规办事。有的领导人员本来就不想制定规划，但是又怕挨批评，就把远景规划定得非常先进，却没有当前规划；或者把当前规划定得很先进，却没有具体措施。结果，职工热情虽然很高，但是不知道怎样去干。有的领导人员制定规划的时候不同群众商量研究，闭门造车。例如综合制材厂厂长坐在办公室里写了半个月规划，不仅一般职工不知道，连副厂长、党总支委员也不知道。不难想像，这样定出来的规划，是不能指导工作的。有的领导人员把规划制定出来以后，总是在干部当中转来转去，不和群众见面。有些行政领导人员不积极支持和领导竞赛运动，说那是工会的事情。有些企业单位对于职工的合理化建议很不重视。宇宙烟厂规定提合理化建议要填表，表上有许多烦琐的项目，工人不会填。工会曾经帮助工人整理了47条合理化建议，但是行政领导人员说：没有按规定填在表上不算事。工人对自己做的工作最为熟悉，许多人都对自己的工作提合理化建议，但是，有些领导人员对工人这样提合理化建议有意见，说：“对自己工作提合理化建议不算什么，应该对别人的工作提合理化建议才算本领。”有一次，工人张玉鹏提了一条节约烟丝的合理化建议，这个建议目前要实现是有困难的，但是，工人积极提建议的精神是很好的，应该热情地欢迎。一个领导人员却冷冷地说：“你这个人就是没事干，专找邪门。”领导人员用这种官僚主义的态度对待合理化建议，工人的情绪很低，提合理化建议越来越少，去年还提了50条合理化建议（至今还没处理），今年1月份只提了两条，2月份一条也没有提。武汉动力机厂以工会为首组织的合理化建议机构不敢公开。他们说：“机构一公开，估计合理化建议一定很多，我们就招架不了。”合理化建议的组织机构不健全，工作无人负责，在一些企业单位是普遍现象。有些企业单位对推广先进经验口头上喊的多，实际上做得很差。203厂的粘帮小组36个月全面均衡地完成计划，209厂的青年班（组）24个月全面均衡地完成计划。这是值得大大推广的。但是，这两个厂子有的领导人员竟认为推广先进经验解决不了什么问题，或者认为推广先进经验会妨碍当前的工作，因而没有很好去推广。有些单位的计划管理、材料供应等各项组织领导工作总是赶不上工作需要。中南第一工程公司2月份的计划到2月18日才下达到基层单位，工人非常不满。中南第二工程公司的材料供应工作做得很差，有些基层单位上午开展竞赛，下午就停工待料。有些基本建设单位由于设计图纸拿不出来，严重影响着施工。
    由于领导方面的保守思想，以及各种工作落后于实际，群众的生产热情虽然空前高涨，但是计划完成得很不平衡。1月份，全市工业生产单位虽然完成了计划，但是不少单位没有完成总产值、产量、劳动生产率计划和技术经济指标；月初松月尾赶任务的现象仍然存在。2月份基本建设和工业生产单位完成计划的情况也不很好。例如，武汉钢铁公司仅完成月计划的33.8％，重型工具机厂到2月中旬才完成月计划的22.5％，肉类联合加工厂到2月中旬才完成月计划的16.7％。
    克服企业领导的右倾保守思想，是进一步使武汉市的生产推向新的高涨的关键。2月下旬，武汉市举行了第三届劳动模范代表大会，会上表扬了先进，树立了旗帜，交流了经验，批判了保守思想，不少企业单位开展了厂际竞赛和同工种竞赛。中共武汉市委号召各级领导迅速把劳动模范代表大会的精神贯彻下去。我们相信，武汉市各企业单位的领导人员必将进一步批判保守思想，站在群众前面，引导群众前进，而且也非这样做不可了。
