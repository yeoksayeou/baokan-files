To all monastic and lay officials and compatriots in the Tibetan region:

Last year, all members of our Tibetan Regional Visiting Group came to the capital of the motherland—Beijing—via the Qinghai-Tibet and Sichuan-Tibet highways. On the eve of National Day, the State Council held a grand banquet, and we gathered together with returned overseas Chinese and representatives of various brotherly ethnic groups. On National Day, we participated in the observation ceremony and witnessed the glorious and great occasion. The stands were filled with guests from various countries. The vast parade of people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life participated, carrying huge banners promoting increased production and over fulfilling production tasks. The army, navy, and air force, equipped with modern weapons, showed great momentum, fully demonstrating the strong national defense power of the motherland. In this great scene, the voices of the marching crowds shouting "Long live Chairman Mao" shook like thunder.

What made us feel most honored in Beijing was meeting our people's sun—Chairman Mao—and the central leaders. We also took a group photo together. Because of Chairman Mao and the central leaders' concern for our Tibetan people, they gave us many valuable instructions. In his instructions, Chairman Mao also called on us to further strengthen national unity, mutual trust, and close ties.

On October 27th last year, we took a train from Beijing to visit various parts of the motherland to see political, economic, cultural, and other construction projects.

The Northeast region is the industrial base of the motherland for building socialism. The machine-building factories there are very large and can manufacture many new types and high-quality hydraulic and thermal power generators, as well as various precision instruments and electric meters. The workers of all ethnic groups in many factories are learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and working selflessly with the help of Soviet experts.

When visiting the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin Province, we saw that the autonomous prefecture had knitting factories, rubber shoe factories, and machine-building factories (mainly producing various agricultural tools). When visiting the Yanbian countryside, we saw agricultural production cooperatives and collective farms. The farmers' lives were full of happiness, and their housing, household equipment, kitchens, and wells were very good. In the countryside, we also saw larger cooperative stores. The most prominent thing is that the autonomous prefecture is particularly developed in culture, with complete universities, middle schools, and primary schools. The number of college students was 400 in 1949, and now there are more than 1,220, and more than 95% of school-age children are in primary school. All are reading textbooks in their own national language. Similarly, in terms of health, there are many large-scale, well-equipped hospitals. Diseases that could not be cured before can now not only be cured but also treated free of charge. This is of great benefit to the people. In terms of ethnic policies: it is like the sun has come out, and its light shines everywhere. The relationship and feelings between the various ethnic groups are particularly close. Regardless of men, women, old or young, they are as close as biological brothers and sisters. Therefore, we have even stronger confidence in national unity. In short, we were very envious of the achievements made by Yanbian Autonomous Prefecture in politics, economy, culture, and other aspects in the past few years since its establishment. Especially for our Tibetan region, the work they have done and the path they have taken are our examples. It is even more in line with our wishes.

In Jilin City, we saw the Fengman Hydropower Station, which is particularly large in scale.

We visited the largest First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. The scale of the plant's main workshops and workers' dormitories is like a new metropolis. This year's National Day will see the production of four-ton trucks. The scale of Anshan Iron and Steel Company is also very large. We were surprised to see the iron flowing out of the iron-smelting furnace like mountains and rivers. Here, various steel products are being manufactured for the socialist construction of the motherland, and there are also abundant iron ore reserves. The beautiful city of Dalian is the motherland's eastern seaport base and throat. During the time of the Kuomintang, we did not have our own rights on our own land. We were oppressed by imperialism and subjected to arbitrary aggression. Now, ships docking at the wharf, no matter what foreign ships, comply with our country's regulations. These are what we saw with our own eyes, and those previous situations are no longer visible. This shows the strength of our motherland.

The Northeast region is an important base for socialist construction. People sincerely feel that the Communist Party's leadership is correct, and everyone is enthusiastically expressing patriotic enthusiasm. No matter which city we go to, everyone is carrying out the socialist construction cause vigorously. In terms of life, the people are very well dressed, especially the workers' dormitories and diet are better than those of the nobles in Tibet.

When we arrived at Labrang Monastery in Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture by car from Lanzhou, we were warmly welcomed by monks and laypeople, old and young. They expressed unlimited sincere faith and respect for the two Living Buddhas, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni. There are often incense and oil lamps offered in front of the Zhen Sanbao Hall of the temple, and the lamas of the temple follow the good rules of the scriptures and monks. We also went to Kumbum Monastery in Qinghai, the birthplace of Tsongkhapa, and paid homage to Sedang God (transliteration). Labrang Monastery and Kumbum Monastery are well-equipped, and the monks live well. We were very happy to see the real situation here.

Shanghai is the largest city in the motherland. In the past, under the rule of imperialism, the people of Shanghai suffered all kinds of hardships. Now, Shanghai has a brand-new look, the traffic order is well-organized, and people's public morality is very good. We visited Rong Yiren's Shenxin No. 9 Cotton Textile Factory, which belongs to a large capitalist in Shanghai. This factory is particularly large, and all production is done by machinery. There are 830 looms and more than 6,000 male and female workers. In 1955, he voluntarily participated in joint state-private ownership. After the joint venture, not only were the profits greater than before, but he also gained a certain position in politics.

There are more than 210 temples in Shanghai, all of which are well protected. Monks carry out various religious activities as usual. Every year in April, about 200,000 pilgrims come to the temples to worship Buddha. When we visited temples such as the Jade Buddha Temple in Shanghai, we saw the monks gathering in the scripture hall, chanting scriptures and reciting Buddha's name, very devoutly. This further strengthened our confidence in the policy of freedom of religious belief.

The construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is an unprecedented major event in the history of the motherland and is also one of the major projects carried out with the selfless help of Soviet experts. When we went to visit, we saw that the bridge's foundation construction was nearly half completed. According to the plan, after the bridge is completed in the future, double-track trains can pass on the top, and six cars can run side by side on the upper level. This large project is 1,700 meters long and is famous in the world. Two large bridges for cars and trains have also been built on the Han River.

We returned to Beijing, and on the first day of the Tibetan calendar, the head of the visiting group and several representatives paid New Year's greetings to Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao gave us many valuable instructions.

During our visit to various parts of the motherland, we saw the motherland's great socialist construction and carried out studies. We saw that the motherland's army, air force, navy, and other forces are very strong.

The most important thing is that under the radiant light of the policies of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the entire cause will only become more prosperous. In terms of economic construction: it is being completed and overfulfilled in accordance with the provisions of the motherland's Five-Year Plan. We have no way to describe and express the greatness of the motherland's Five-Year Construction Plan. The light of ethnic policies shines throughout the country. There are many ethnic minorities in many factories, but the care for them and the respect for their customs are meticulous.

Regarding the construction of the new Tibet, with the strong help of the Han people in the future, we will surely prosper and develop, and the lives of the monks and laypeople will gradually become happy and fulfilling.

The Tibetan region is a region where politics and religion are united. The people value and protect religious beliefs as much as their lives. In the future, as long as the monks unite and practice diligently, religion will not only not weaken but will also be protected by the Chinese Communist Party. This is certain. Therefore, everyone must clearly recognize this point and not have any doubts or concerns.

During the visit, we were warmly welcomed and enthusiastically received by the leaders of the local people's committees at all levels and the working comrades of the brotherly ethnic groups in every region and city we went to. They were always concerned about the construction work in Tibet. The comrades from the Central Nationalities Affairs Commission and the Tibet Working Committee who helped with the work in the delegation gave us great assistance in all aspects.

We firmly believe that in the future, under the wise leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, with the strong support of the people of all ethnic groups in the country, and with the specific assistance of the People's Liberation Army and staff stationed in Tibet, we will further strengthen and consolidate the close unity between the various ethnic groups and within Tibet, and under the guidance of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, we will rapidly build a prosperous and happy new Tibet and the motherland's great socialism.

Finally, let us shout:

Long live the great unity of the people of all ethnic groups in the country!
Long live the close unity of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni!
Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
Long live the great leader of the people of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao!

    西藏地区参观团团长拉鲁·策旺多吉
    向西藏僧俗人民的广播词（摘要）西藏地区的各位僧俗官员、全体同胞们：
    去年我们西藏地区参观团全体人员从青藏、康藏两条公路来到了祖国首都——北京。国庆节前夕，国务院举行了盛大宴会，我们和归国华侨、各兄弟民族的代表大家欢聚一堂。国庆节这天，我们参加了观礼，看到了光荣、伟大的盛况。观礼台上站满了各国的来宾。各族各界的广大游行队伍抬着提高生产和超额完成生产任务的巨幅标语参加游行。装备着现代化的各种武器的陆、海、空军声势浩大，这充分显示了祖国强大的国防力量。在这种伟大的场面中，游行队伍高呼“毛主席万岁”的声音如雷一样地震动着。
    在北京使我们感到最光荣的是见到了我们各族人民的太阳——毛主席和中央各位首长，大家还在一起合了影，由于毛主席和中央各位首长对我们藏族人民的关怀，给予了我们许多宝贵的指示。主席的指示中还号召我们要进一步加强民族团结，互相信任和亲密的联系。
    去年10月27日，我们坐着火车从北京出发前往祖国各地参观政治、经济、文化等各项建设。
    东北地区是祖国建设社会主义的工业基地。那里的机器制造厂规模很大，能制造许多新的品种和质量优良的水力、火力用的各型发电机，还可以制造各种精密仪器和电表等。许多工厂的各族工人们学习着苏联的先进经验，并在苏联专家的帮助下忘我地劳动着。
    在吉林省延边朝鲜族自治州参观时，我们看见了自治州设有针织厂、胶鞋厂和机器制造厂（主要是生产各种农具）。参观延边农村时，我们看到了农业生产合作社和集体农庄。农民的生活充满了幸福，他们住的房屋、家庭的设备、厨房、洋井等条件很好。在农村中，我们还看到了较大的合作社商店。最突出的是自治州在文化方面特别发达，有完整的大学、中学、小学，光是大学生1949年是400人，现在就有1，220多名，小学生占学龄儿童的95％以上。都是读本民族文字的课本。同样在卫生方面有很多规模大、设备好的医院，以前无法治的疾病，现在不仅能治而且还免费治疗。这对人民有着很大的益处。在民族政策方面：就如太阳出来了，光辉普照着。各民族之间的关系和感情特别亲密，无论男女老幼都像亲生的兄弟姐妹一样亲切。因此，在民族团结方面我们更有了坚强的信心。总之延边自治州自成立后几年来在政治、经济、文化等方面获得的成就，我们看了很羡慕，尤其对我们西藏地区来说，他们做的工作和走的道路就是我们的榜样。更是符合了我们的意愿。
    在吉林市我们看了小丰满水力发电厂，它的规模特别大。
    我们参观了规模最大的第一汽车制造厂，这个厂的主要车间和工人宿舍的规模就如同大都市一样的在新建，今年国庆节就能生产载重四吨的卡车。鞍山钢铁公司的规模也很大，我们看到熔铁炉的铁就像山水一样的流出来，感到很惊喜。这里为祖国的社会主义建设在制造着各种钢材，同时还有蕴藏量丰富的铁矿。风景秀丽的大连是祖国东方的海港基地和咽喉。在国民党的时候，自己的土地上没有自己的权利。由帝国主义来压迫，进行任意地侵略。现在，轮船停泊的码头上不管任何外国的船只都遵守我们国家的规定，这些是我们亲眼看到的，以前的那些情况根本看不到了，这就说明了我们祖国力量的强大。
    东北地区是社会主义建设的重要基地，人们衷心感到共产党领导正确，大家怀着兴奋的心情，表现出爱国主义的热情，我们无论到那个城市，大家都在轰轰烈烈地进行社会主义建设事业。在生活方面人民的衣著都很好，尤其是工人们的宿舍和饮食比西藏的贵族还要好。
    当我们从兰州坐汽车到达甘南藏族自治州拉卜楞寺的时候，受到老幼僧众的热烈欢迎。他们对达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼两位活佛表示了无限的赤诚信仰和尊重。寺庙的真三宝殿前经常有香火油灯供养，寺庙的喇嘛都依据经师和僧徒的良好清规。我们还到了宗喀巴的诞生地——青海塔尔寺，朝拜了塞当神（译音）。拉卜楞寺和塔尔寺条件完备，僧众生活很好。我们看到这里的真实情况后感到很高兴。
    上海是祖国最大的城市。以前，在帝国主义的统治下，上海的人民受尽了苦难。现在，上海市的面貌焕然一新，交通秩序有条不紊，人们的公共道德很好。我们参观了上海大资本家荣毅仁的申新第九棉纺厂。这个工厂特别大，全部都是用机械来生产，其中织布机就有830台，男女工人有6，000多人。1955年他自愿地参加了公私合营，合营后不但利润比以前更多了，并且他在政治上也有了一定地位。
    上海市有210多个寺庙，都保护得很好，僧众照例进行着各种宗教活动，每年到了4月间来寺庙朝佛的香客就有20万人左右。当我们参观上海玉佛等寺的时候，看到僧徒们集聚经堂，在诵经念佛，十分虔诚。这就更使我们对宗教信仰自由政策有了坚定的信心。
    修建武汉长江大桥是在祖国历史上根本未曾有过的大事，也是在苏联专家无私的帮助下进行的大工程之一。我们去参观时，亲眼看到这个大工程的桥基建筑快完成一半了。按计划，将来修成大桥后，上面可通行双轨火车，再上层可并行六辆汽车，这个大工程全长有1，700公尺，它在世界上也是驰名的。在汉水上也修起了通汽车和通火车的两座大桥，工程也是很大的。
    我们返回北京，在藏历年初一这天，参观团的负责人和几位代表向毛主席拜了年。主席对我们作了许多宝贵的指示。
    在祖国各地参观中，我们看到了祖国伟大的社会主义建设，并进行了学习。我们看到了祖国的陆军、空军、海军等力量是非常雄厚的。
    最主要的是，在中国共产党和毛主席的政策的光辉照耀下，整个的事业只有日益繁荣昌盛。在经济建设方面：正按照祖国五年计划的规定在完成和超额完成。祖国五年建设计划的伟大，我们没有办法形容和说出来。民族政策的光辉照耀着全国，在许多工厂中有不少的少数民族，但对他们的照顾和风俗习惯的尊重是无微不至的。
    关于新西藏的建设方面，今后在汉族人民的大力帮助下，我们一定会繁荣发展，僧俗人民的生活也会逐渐美满幸福。
    西藏地区是政教合一的地区，人民对宗教信仰如同生命一样的重视和保护着，今后只要僧侣在团结一致的基础上身笃厉行，那么宗教不但不会衰弱，而且有中国共产党保护着。这是肯定了的。所以大家要认识清楚这一点，不要有丝毫的怀疑和顾虑。
    在参观中我们每到一个地区和城市都受到了当地各级人民委员会的负责人、各兄弟民族工作同志的热烈欢迎和热情接待，并对西藏的建设工作时时刻刻在关怀着。随团帮助工作的中央民委、西藏工委的同志们在各方面给予我们很大的帮助。
    我们坚决相信，今后在伟大的中国共产党、毛主席和国务院的英明领导下，在全国各族人民的大力支援、进藏人民解放军、工作人员的具体帮助下，进一步加强和巩固各民族之间和西藏内部的亲密团结，并在达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼的指导下，迅速建设繁荣幸福的新西藏和祖国伟大的社会主义。
    最后让我们高呼：
    全国各族人民大团结万岁！
    达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼亲密团结万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
                        （新华社）
