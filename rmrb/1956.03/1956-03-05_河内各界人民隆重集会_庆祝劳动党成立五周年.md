In his report, he stated that the founding day of the Vietnam Labor Party is a day of great historical significance in the Party and the Vietnamese national liberation movement.

He also pointed out that the tasks of struggle for the Vietnam Labor Party and the Vietnamese people, both at present and in the future, are arduous and complex. Le Van Luong said that for the lofty interests of the Vietnamese nation, the Vietnam Labor Party will unite with all organizations and individuals who agree with peace and unification in an open and honest manner, to cut off the claws of the United States and Ngo Dinh Diem in instigating war, and jointly strive to build a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam.

    Le Van Luong also said in his report that the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union brought great encouragement and confidence to the people of the world.

    Le Van Luong emphasized that although the struggle of the Vietnam Labor Party and the Vietnamese people is still long-term and arduous, with the close unity of the people throughout the country and the support of peace-loving people around the world, they will surely achieve victory.

    Subsequently, representatives of Vietnamese model workers in industry and agriculture, representatives of the Vietnamese Socialist Party, representatives of the Vietnamese Democratic Party, and representatives of the Vietnamese People's Army spoke at the meeting.
