    Cannot Eat the Seeds
    Recently, some members of agricultural production cooperatives in Xinhua County, Hunan Province, disregarding the needs of the cooperatives, have been eating large quantities of seeds. According to a survey in Shiqiao Township, 125 farming households in the township ate more than 2,800 jin of grain seeds, of which 116 households were cooperative members. In Liuxi Township, 7 cooperatives lacked more than 5,000 jin of grain seeds, but 55 cooperative members had already eaten more than 3,400 jin of seeds. The main reason for cooperative members eating large quantities of seeds is not due to difficult living conditions, but because they have the mistaken idea of "relying on the cooperative to solve all problems" and are indifferent to the difficulties faced by the cooperative in lacking seeds.
    If this waste of seeds is not quickly corrected, it will create great difficulties for the upcoming spring plowing and production. Agricultural cooperatives should take measures to quickly raise and preserve the seeds necessary for spring plowing and production. At the same time, ideological education should be strengthened among the members, and the idea of "taking the cooperative as home" should be established among the members.

    不能吃掉种子
    最近湖南新化县有些农业生产合作社社员不顾合作社的需要，把大量种子吃掉。据石桥乡检查，全乡有125户农家吃掉谷种2，800多斤，其中有116户是社员。柳溪乡7个社共缺谷种5，000多斤，但是55户社员已经吃掉的种子就有3，400多斤。社员大量吃种子，主要原因不是由于生活困难，而是由于他们有“一切问题依靠社里解决”的错误想法，对于合作社缺少种子的困难漠不关心。
    这种浪费种子的情况如果不迅速纠正，会给即将到来的春耕生产造成很大困难。农业合作社应该采取办法，迅速筹集和保存春耕生产中所必需的种子。同时应该加强对社员的思想教育，在社员中树立“以社为家”的思想。
