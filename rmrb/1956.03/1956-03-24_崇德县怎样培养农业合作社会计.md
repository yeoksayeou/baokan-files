How Chongde County Trains Accounting Staff for Agricultural Cooperatives

Zhang Binghen, Secretary of the Chongde County Party Committee

With the great development of agricultural cooperativization in Chongde County, Zhejiang Province, many agricultural production cooperatives could not find accounting staff; most of the accountants who had been assigned were also unable to do their jobs well due to their low level of education and weak accounting skills. At that time, the county's leading organs mobilized a group of junior and senior primary school graduates to go to the countryside to serve as accountants for agricultural cooperatives, but the number was still limited.

The Chongde County Party Committee carefully studied this situation and believed that the old cooperatives had encountered similar difficulties in the past. For example, Zhang Zuxing, the accountant of Chongyi Agricultural Cooperative in Dama Township, and Liu Guiqing, the accountant of Liujiaba Agricultural Cooperative in Lingzhi Township, had only one year of schooling and could not keep accounts or use an abacus at all. However, after one or two years of training, they became first-class accountants for the cooperatives. If the whole Party took action, strengthened leadership, and trained the existing cooperative accountants, the accounting problem of the cooperatives could be solved in a short period of time. Therefore, the County Party Committee decided to adopt the method of "using local materials and guaranteeing teaching and learning" to train a large number of accountants.

The County Party Committee made a comprehensive plan for the training of accountants. Cooperatives without accountants selected promising young and middle-aged members to serve as accountants. After solving the shortage of accountants, all accountants (including those in the old cooperatives) were included in the accounting guidance network according to their different levels. At the same time, the county and district leading organs mobilized relevant departments to organize old cooperative accountants, primary school teachers, credit cooperative accountants, grassroots supply and marketing cooperative accountants, agricultural finance cadres, etc. to be responsible for guaranteed teaching and learning under the unified leadership of the township branches during their spare time, and signed guaranteed teaching and learning contracts, stipulating the graduation period (most of those with higher education were three months, the general ones were six months, and the individual ones who needed to start from literacy needed more than six months, and no more than one year). Each township branch also appointed a cadre (clerk or township cadre suitable for this work) to be specifically responsible for the business leadership of this work.

In the process of implementing this method, various difficulties were encountered: first, some cadres lacked confidence in training accountants. For example, Shen Rongquan, a full-time cadre in charge of cooperatives in Zhouquan District, said: "These accountants can't even write, how can they be trained?" Second, some of the accountants being trained also had a sense of inferiority, thinking that they were clumsy and could only hold a hoe handle, and that holding a pen was more difficult than holding a hoe. Of course, there were indeed specific difficulties in the guidance. For example, some primary school teachers did not know how to use an abacus and did not understand accounting business, credit cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperative accountants only understood their own business and did not understand the business of agricultural cooperatives, and old cooperative accountants were busy with autumn harvest distribution at this time. When encountering these difficulties, some township leaders took a perfunctory approach and did not conscientiously implement the "guaranteed teaching and learning" provisions; however, other townships strengthened their leadership and found ways to overcome the difficulties, so that this work was carried out smoothly. The Dama Township Party Branch leadership created the method of "teaching and learning every night, meeting three times a month, teaching and learning at the same time, and learning and doing at the same time." In addition to taking time to carry out guaranteed teaching and guidance to fixed objects every night, it was also stipulated that meeting were held in three natural villages on the evenings of the 8th, 9th, and 10th of each month, and each accountant brought account books for mutual review, correction of errors, and exchange of experience. Primary school teacher Han Zhiqing also used the method of "teaching what you encounter" to combine teaching with practice. Tongfu Township adopted the method of "collective classes, separate guidance, and individual guaranteed teaching," which also achieved good results. Some townships also stipulated that experience exchange meetings should be held once a month during the learning process to promote the work. The County Party Committee also promptly summarized and promoted the above experience. In this way, the various difficulties encountered at one time were overcome one by one.

In late November of last year, the county also specially organized a training class for new cooperative accountants. Due to the early "guaranteed teaching and learning" guidance foundation, the results achieved by the trained accountants were better than in any previous session. According to the statistics of 728 new cooperative accountants, after several months of training, 450 could work independently, 247 could work independently after a short period of guidance, and 31 still needed a longer period of guidance to work independently. Now, most of the agricultural cooperatives in the county have already recorded accounts according to the new accounting books.

    崇德县怎样培养农业合作社会计
    中共崇德县委书记　张冰痕
    浙江省崇德县随着农业合作化的大发展，许多农业生产合作社找不到会计；已经配备的会计也大部因为文化水平低，会计业务能力弱而不能称职。当时县的领导机关便动员一批初中、高小毕业生去农村担任农业合作社的会计，但是数量仍有限。
    中共崇德县委认真地研究了这个情况，认为过去老社中也曾遇到过同样的困难，如大麻乡崇益农业合作社的会计张祖兴、灵支乡刘家坝农业合作社的会计刘桂清，都只读了一年书，根本不会记账和不会珠算，但是经过一、二年的培养，都成了合作社的一等会计。如果全党动手，加强领导，对现有合作社会计加以培养，完全可以在短期间内解决社的会计问题。因此县委决定采取“就地取材、包教保学”的办法来大量培养会计。
    县委对培养会计工作进行了全面规划。没有会计的社，从社员中挑选出有培养前途的青壮年担任会计。在解决会计缺额以后，把所有会计（包括老社会计在内）进行质量规划，根据不同程度，分别编入会计辅导网。和这同时，县区领导机关动员各有关部门，分别组织老社会计、小学教员、信用社会计、基层供销社会计、农业金融干部等利用业余时间在乡支部统一领导下负责包教，并且订立包教保学合同，规定毕业期限（文化较高的人大部为三个月，一般的为六个月，个别要从扫盲开始的则需六个月以上，最多不超过一年）。各乡支部并指定一个干部（文书或适宜做此工作的乡干部）专门负责对这项工作的业务领导。
    这一办法在贯彻执行中，也曾遇到各种困难：首先是一部分干部对培养会计缺少信心，如洲泉区办社专职干部沈荣泉说：“这些会计写也写不来，如何培养得出。”其次，部分被培养的会计对象，也有自卑心理，认为自己粗手粗脚，只好拿锄头柄，拿笔杆比拿锄头还吃力。当然，在辅导中确实有业务上的具体困难。如有的小学教员不懂珠算，不懂会计业务，信用社、供销社会计只懂自己的业务，不懂农业合作社的业务，老社会计这时候又忙于秋收分配。当遇到这些困难的时候，有一部分乡的领导人员就采取应付的办法，不认真贯彻执行“包教保学”的规定；但是，另一部分乡由于加强了领导，找到克服困难的办法，而使这一工作顺利展开。大麻乡党支部领导创造了“夜夜教、夜夜学，一月三碰头，边教边学，边学边做”的方法，每晚除掉抽出时间对固定对象进行包教辅导外，还规定在每逢八、九、十晚上分别在三个自然村举行碰头会，各会计带来账册，进行互审，纠正差错，交流经验。小学教员韩志清还用“遇到什么教什么”的办法，使教学和实际结合起来。同福乡采用了“集体上课，分头辅导，个别包教”的办法，也收到很好效果。有些乡在学习过程中还规定了每月召开一次经验交流会议，以推动工作的进行。县委也及时总结推广了上述经验。这样，一度遇到的各项困难都一个个地克服了。
    去年十一月下旬，县里又专门办了一期新社会计训练班，由于有了前期“包教保学”的辅导基础，使经过训练的会计所得成绩比过去任何一期都好。据728个新社会计的统计，经过几个月的培养，能独立工作的450个，再经过短期辅导就能独立工作的247个，还需经过较长时间辅导才能独立工作的有三十一个。现在，全县大部分农业合作社都已经按新式会计账册记账了。
