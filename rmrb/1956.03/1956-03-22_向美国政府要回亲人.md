Zhang Lanfen's sister, Zhang Zhifen's letter:

	My sister, Zhang Lanfen, went to the Department of Anatomy at the University of Rochester Medical School in New York in 1949, lured by an American scholarship to study histology. She regretted going to America soon after arriving. In 1954, she wrote to me several times about the U.S. government obstructing her return to China. In a letter dated May 1954, she said: "...You said there is a way to return, what way is it? We are being watched, and not allowed to leave! Anyone who wants to leave has to go through an individual review, and school research probably cannot continue. Future assignments cannot be ignored, which is extremely frustrating. What democracy is this? The U.S. government has ulterior motives, and I don't know if I will be able to write to you in the future." A letter in September of the same year said: "It is impossible to go back temporarily. My passport has been withheld, and I have been called in for questioning. I will tell you the details when I see you later..." Since then, we have not received any more letters from her, and we do not know her whereabouts. We sent her several letters, telling her about the Geneva Sino-American ambassadorial talks, but received no reply.

	At the end of January this year, she suddenly sent a letter, mentioning that she had transferred to work in Iowa, but did not mention returning to China, nor did she mention receiving our letters. I think she must have been persecuted by the American authorities. I request the government to assist in demanding that the American authorities release her to return to participate in the construction of the motherland.

Cao Bainian's wife, Yang Zhexian's letter:

	Recently, I read many letters in the "People's Daily" from family members of Chinese students in the United States demanding the return of their relatives from the U.S. government, which increased my hatred for the barbaric and inhumane behavior of the U.S. government, because I am also a victim.

	My husband, Cao Bainian, went to the United States in 1947 to study pharmacognosy and pharmacology at the School of Pharmacy of the University of Washington in Seattle. He obtained a doctorate in pharmacy in 1951 and then taught at the University of Texas in Austin. From the autumn of 1952 to now, he has transferred to teach at the University of Oregon in Oregon.

	After the nationwide liberation, I kept writing to him, telling him about the rapidly developing new things in the motherland, and urging him to return to the motherland as soon as possible to participate in construction. In a letter dated September 1951, he said: "I will definitely return home in June next year!" But in a letter dated January 1952, he said: "...I am reporting some bad news to you. The other day I received a reply from the Immigration Bureau, rejecting my application to return to China. It stated that if I attempt to leave the United States, I will be imprisoned for five years and fined $5,000. Given this situation, I think it will be difficult to return home..."

	After the Sino-American ambassadorial talks reached an agreement on the issue of civilians returning to their respective countries, my two children and I had great hopes for his return. We also sent him the communiqué of the talks, asking him to strive to return home as soon as possible. At that time, I thought that the U.S. government might not dare to openly violate the agreement anymore, but the reality is not so. He replied: "Your letters advising me to return home immediately are all very correct, but I cannot fulfill your expectations for the time being, because I have unspeakable suffering..." Recent letters often mentioned that he was in a bad mood and had to take sleeping pills almost every night to fall asleep, and he did not dare to mention the issue of returning home. My husband is so eager to return home, but the U.S. government prevents him from returning to the motherland that he misses day and night. This shows that the U.S. government not only does not implement the agreement, but instead intensifies its persecution and threats against Chinese students.

	I request the government to lodge a serious protest with the U.S. government. The Chinese people will never allow the U.S. government to continue to illegally persecute Chinese students. The U.S. government must implement the agreement reached at the talks and allow my husband and other Chinese students in the United States to return home freely and peacefully.

Cao Bainian's son's letter:

	Our father, Cao Bainian, is a student studying in the United States. He went to the United States in 1947 and is now teaching at the University of Oregon in Oregon. After liberation, we wrote to him asking him to return home. He also missed us very much and hoped to return to the motherland as soon as possible, but when he applied to return home, he was unreasonably obstructed by the U.S. government, who threatened him with fines and imprisonment if he tried to return home, so he could not return. Since the Sino-American ambassadorial talks reached an agreement, we thought that our father would definitely be able to return to the motherland this time, but the U.S. government still tried every means to obstruct him, preventing our father from being with us. The U.S. government also used words like sending them back to Taiwan to intimidate Chinese students who requested to return home. Under this persecution, our father has not returned to this day.

	We have been separated from our father for eight years. Since the nationwide liberation, the motherland has achieved great achievements in all aspects, and the people of the whole country are working hard to create a better future, but our father is unfortunately detained by the hateful U.S. government and cannot return home to participate in construction. When our father left us, we were just two young children, but now we are high school and junior high school students. Our father cannot see the happy life of the motherland, nor can he see us and our mother. How painful he is! Therefore, we urgently request the government to lodge a serious protest with the U.S. government so that our father and Chinese students in the United States can return to the motherland and reunite with their relatives.

### 向美国政府要回亲人

    向美国政府要回亲人
    张兰芬的妹妹张茝芬的来信
    我的姐姐张兰芬，1949年受美国奖学金的引诱，去美国纽约罗彻斯特医学院解剖系学习组织学。对于这次去美国，到美国不久她就很后悔。1954年数次给我妹妹来信谈到美国政府阻挠她的回国的情形。在1954年5月来信中曾这样说；“……你说回去有方法，有什么方法呢？我们等于被人看起来，不准离境！要走的都要经个别审查，学校的研究大概也不能继续下去，以后分派的事不能不作，真是气恼之极，什么民主不民主，美国政府的居心实在不良，以后是否还能给你们写信也不得而知”。同年九月来信说：“暂时是无法回去的，护照已被扣留了，还被叫去审问，详情等以后见着再谈了……”。从此以后，我们再没有收到她的来信，也不知她的去向，给她去过几封信，告诉她日内瓦中美大使级会谈情况，但都未得到她的复信。
    今年一月底，她忽然寄来一封信，谈到她已转到衣阿华州工作，但只字未提及回国之事，也没有提到收到我们的信。我想她一定是受到美国当局的迫害了。我请求政府协助，要美国当局放她回来参加祖国的建设事业。

    曹柏年的妻子杨哲娴的来信
    近来在“人民日报”上读了许多我国留美学生家属向美国政府要回亲人的信，增加了我对美国政府这种野蛮和惨无人道行为的痛恨，因为我也是受害者之一。
    我的爱人曹柏年，1947年去美国，在西雅图华盛顿大学药学院进修生药学和药理学，1951年得药学博士学位，即在奥斯丁城得克萨斯大学任教，从1952年秋到现在，转至俄勒冈州俄勒冈大学任教。
    全国解放后，我不断写信给他，告诉祖国突飞猛进的新事物，并催他早日返回祖国参加建设，他来信也深切表示对祖国和家人的怀念。1951年9月他来信说：“我于明年六月一定返国！”，但在1952年1月的来信说：“……报告你一个坏消息，前天接到移民局回信，批驳了我的回国申请书，上面注明假若我企图离开美国，将坐牢五年，罚款五千美元，照这样情况看来，我想难回国了……”。
    在中美大使级会谈关于双方平民回国问题达成协议后，我和两个孩子对他的回国抱着很大的希望，也曾将会谈公报寄去，要他争取早日回国。当时我认为美国政府可能不敢再明目张胆违反协议了，但是事实并不如此，他回信说：“你们来信劝我即时回国，都非常之对，不过我暂时不能如你们的期望，因为我有说不出的苦……”。最近来信常常提到他的心绪不佳，几乎每晚都要服安眠药才能入睡，而对回国问题则连提都不敢提。我的爱人这样迫切地希望回国，但是美国政府却阻挠他回到日夜思念的祖国，这说明了美国政府非但不执行协议，反而变本加厉地迫害和威胁中国留学生。
    我请求政府向美国政府提出严重抗议，中国人民决不允许美国政府继续对中国留学生进行非法迫害，美国政府必须执行会谈协议，让我的爱人和其他中国留美学生自由地和平安地回国。
                      北京　杨哲娴
    曹柏年的儿子的来信
    我们的父亲曹柏年是留美学生，1947年去美国，现在俄勒冈州的俄勒冈大学教书。解放后我们去信要他回国，他也很想念我们，也希望早日回到祖国，但在申请回国时，受到了美国政府的无理阻挠，并威胁他如果企图回国就要罚款和坐牢，因而他无法回来。自从中美大使级会谈达成协议后，我们想父亲这次一定能回到祖国了，但是美国政府仍然千方百计地阻挠，不让父亲和我们在一起，美国政府并且用送回台湾去之类的话来恐吓要求回国的中国留学生，在这种迫害下，使得我们的父亲到今天还没有回来。
    我们离开父亲已经八年了。自从全国解放后，祖国在各方面都获得了巨大的成就，全国人民都在辛勤地劳动着，在创造美好的未来，但是我们的父亲不幸被可恶的美国政府扣留着，不能回国参加建设。当父亲离开我们的时候我们还只是两个小孩子，而现在我们已是高中和初中的学生了，父亲看不到祖国幸福的生活，也看不到我们和妈妈。他是多么地痛苦啊！因此，我们迫切地恳求政府向美国政府提出严重抗议，让我们的父亲和在美国的中国留学生能回到祖国，和亲人团聚。
