Ninety-five machinery manufacturing plants under the First Ministry of Machine Building recently signed inter-factory competition contracts based on product specialization. Including the factories that had already signed inter-factory competition contracts in the past, more than one hundred factories under the First Ministry of Machine Building are now participating in inter-factory competition.

The spirit of "more, faster, better, and more economical" was implemented in the recently signed inter-factory competition contracts. The competition contracts stipulate guarantees for completing various national plan targets ahead of schedule, improving product quality, trial-producing new types of products, saving raw materials, and ensuring safe production.

Prior to this batch of factories signing inter-factory competition contracts, socialist competition had been widely carried out within the factories under the First Ministry of Machine Building. Among them, more than sixty factories proposed guarantees to complete the Five-Year Plan in four years. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    机械制造厂的厂际竞赛
    第一机械工业部九十五个机械制造厂，最近按产品专业分别签订了厂际竞赛合同，加上过去已经签订厂际竞赛合同的工厂在内，第一机械工业部已有一百多个工厂参加厂际竞赛。
    在最近签订的厂际竞赛合同中，都贯彻了“多、快、好、省”的精神。竞赛合同规定了提前完成国家各项计划指标、提高产品质量、试制新种类产品、节约原材料和安全生产等项保证条件。
    在这一批工厂签订厂际竞赛合同以前，第一机械工业部所属工厂内部都普遍开展了社会主义竞赛，其中有六十多个工厂提出了四年完成五年计划的保证。　　（据新华社讯）
