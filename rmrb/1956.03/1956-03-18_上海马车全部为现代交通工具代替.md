    Shanghai's horse-drawn carriages have recently been entirely eliminated. Previously, only 14 horse-drawn carriages remained in the city, operating in remote areas. These remaining carriages were very old and dilapidated, and the horses were thin and old, unsuitable for use as public transportation. They have now all been replaced by modern transportation. After the horse-drawn carriages were eliminated, the coachmen have all been appropriately reassigned.

    上海马车全部为现代交通工具代替
    上海市的马车最近已经全部取消。在这以前，全市只剩下14辆马车在偏僻地区行驶。这些残存的马车车辆已很破旧，马匹又瘦又老，不适合于再作公共交通工具，现在已经全部为现代交通工具代替。马车取消以后，车工们都得到了适当的安排。
