    Improving Methods for Purchasing Surplus Cotton from Rural Areas
    Wang Nianzu

    The 1955 cotton purchasing work has achieved great success. According to incomplete statistics as of February 15th this year, the country has completed 97.04% of the cotton unified purchase task, an increase of 49% compared to the total purchase volume in 1954. However, due to the rapid development of the national textile industry and the good cotton harvest last year, purchasing departments should acquire even more cotton this year. Therefore, regions that have not completed the cotton unified purchase task must strive to complete it; regions that have completed or exceeded the unified purchase task should also strive to purchase more surplus cotton.

    According to surveys in various regions, farmers still have a certain amount of surplus cotton. Among the 714 households surveyed in Lianrang Township, Changan District, Jingjiang County, Jiangsu Province, each household had some marketable cotton in reserve. A typical survey of four villages in Jin County and Gaiping County, Liaoning Province, showed that cotton farmers' cotton reserves accounted for 6% to 10% of cotton production. Therefore, it is unrealistic for some cadres to blindly believe that the purchasing work can be relaxed.

    The problem now is: what methods can be used to purchase the surplus cotton, given that farmers are very busy with production activities?

    After the new cotton harvest last year, there was an unprecedented enthusiasm for selling cotton everywhere. However, once the cotton purchasing off-season arrived, farmers' cotton reserves were relatively scattered, and they were too busy with production to go to the cotton stations to sell cotton. Under such circumstances, if the purchasing methods are not changed accordingly, it will not be possible to purchase the cotton in the hands of farmers. According to the new situation, the purchasing departments in many areas of Hebei Province have adopted the practice of sending people to the countryside for mobile purchasing. By clearing cotton pre-purchase contracts and combining the work of supplying materials by supply and marketing cooperatives, they mobilized farmers to sell cotton. For cotton farmers who sell cotton exceeding the pre-purchase contract, grain coupons and cloth coupons should be issued promptly according to regulations to encourage the enthusiasm of the masses to sell cotton. In early January, Dongguang County, Hebei Province, dispatched 31 mobile purchasing teams to 114 villages to conduct publicity and clear pre-purchase contracts. In 6 days, they collected more than 700,000 jin of cotton, increasing the county's purchase volume by 44% in early January. After Gu'an County implemented mobile purchasing in the countryside, the daily purchase volume rose from 15,840 jin to 18,195 jin. These examples show that as long as we adapt to the current new situation in rural areas and improve purchasing methods, it is entirely possible to complete and exceed the cotton purchasing tasks.

    改进收购农村存棉的方法
    王念祖
    1955年度的棉花收购工作，已经取得很大成绩。截至本年2月15日的不完全统计，全国已经完成棉花统购任务的97.04％，比1954年全年收购量增加49％。但是由于国家纺织工业发展很快，去年棉花的收成也很好，采购部门今年应该收购更多的棉花。因此，没有完成棉花统购任务的地区，须要努力争取完成；已经完成或者超额完成统购任务的地区，也应该争取把更多的存棉收购上来。
    根据各地调查，目前农民手里还有一定数量的存棉。江苏省靖江县长安区廉让乡调查的714户当中，每家都存有部分商品棉；辽宁省锦县、盖平4个村的典型调查，棉农存棉量占棉花产量的6％至10％。因此，某些干部盲目地认为可以放松收购工作，是不切合实际情况的。
    现在的问题是：在目前农民生产活动十分繁忙的情况下，用什么办法把存棉收购上来。
    去年新棉收获以后，到处都出现了空前未有的踊跃售棉情况。但是一进入收棉淡季，农民存棉比较零星，又忙于生产，顾不上到棉站出售棉花。在这样的情况下，如果不能相应地改变收购方法，便不能把农民手里的存棉收购上来。河北省不少地区的收购部门根据新的情况，采取了派人下乡流动收购的作法，通过清理棉花预购合同并且结合供销合作社的物资供应工作，动员农民出售棉花。对于售棉超过预购合同的棉农，应该随时按照规定发给优待的粮票、布票，鼓舞群众的售棉热情。河北省东光县1月初出动31个下乡收购组，深入114个村，一面进行宣传，一面清理预购合同，6天中收棉70多万斤，使全县1月上旬增加收量44％。固安县实行下乡流动收购以后，日收量由15，840斤回升到18，195斤。这些事例，都说明只要适应当前农村的新情况，改进收购方法，是完全可以完成和超额完成棉花采购任务的。
