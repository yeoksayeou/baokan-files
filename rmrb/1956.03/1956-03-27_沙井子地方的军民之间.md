    Between the Military and Civilians in Shajingzi
    Chu Anping
    The Shajingzi area, south of Aksu, was originally a barrenæ»©, but since the troops began reclaiming it, it has now become the Victory Farm with a large area of 100,000 mu.

    In Xinjiang, water is the lifeline. As soon as the troops arrived here, they first tackled the fundamental problem of water. Starting in 1951, they spent more than two years digging the sixty-seven-kilometer-long Victory Canal through the hard Gobi Desert. While the troops were digging the canal, they were also carrying out the planning work for the farm. Before this, the troops had already reclaimed some land of better quality. In order to facilitate mechanized farming and water management, it was necessary to exchange this land and approximately 7,200 mu of land belonging to 261 local ethnic minority families within the planned area.

    In that land exchange, the troops took care of the interests of the local ethnic minority people in every way. The old folks got good land in exchange for good land, and even barren land could be exchanged for good land. The troops first led the old folks to see the land in various places, and the troops exchanged the land wherever the old folks wanted to exchange it. An old man named Rouzi Hasaff, because he had land elsewhere, refused to exchange land after he handed it over. The troop leaders believed that the people's land could not be accepted without compensation. So they sent people with ten fat sheep and 2,400 catties of corn to Rouzi Hasaff's home. The old man was so moved that he cried, saying that he used to be hungry often, but now his life is better, and he should help the People's Liberation Army establish a state-owned farm. Moreover, his land had been barren for many years, and the land was not good, so how could he accept such a generous gift. He refused to accept it. The people sent by the troops had no choice but to ask the village head to help persuade him, and the old man reluctantly accepted it. Another old man named Rouzi Jiejang did not have any labor at home, so he gave up the land in Shajingzi and did not want to exchange it again, so the troops sent him 5,000 catties of wheat. He used these 5,000 catties of wheat to open a Nang shop at the nearby Ayingkeba Bazaar. Later, whenever he saw soldiers in yellow clothes passing by, he would pull them into the shop to drink tea and eat Nang, saying, "This Nang was given to me by your troops."

    Some of the land had already grown winter wheat seedlings when it was exchanged. The troops calculated the amount of wheat to be returned to the old folks based on the highest possible yield of winter wheat from those lands. If there were tree seedlings on the land, the troops would pay the old folks in cash according to the prices stipulated by the government. In addition, the troops also gave more than 7,000 apricot and peach seedlings grown by themselves to the old folks. Those who handed over more land and wanted less land were also given agricultural tools such as hoes, sickles, and plows.

    Of the 261 ethnic minority families with land, 45 lived in Shajingzi. For these 45 families, the troops unconditionally built new houses for them and helped them move. The location of the houses and how they were built were all solicited from the owners in advance. I visited Misha, a technician at the Victory Agricultural Production Cooperative. Misha originally lived in two old houses, plus a thatched cottage, a stable, and a broken pen. When the houses were being built, the troops sent a translator and a designer to ask him how he wanted to build them. Misha said: "I chose the land, and the designer drew the drawings according to my ideas: where the door should be opened, where the Kang should be built, etc. The designer asked me where the windows should be opened? I said I don't want windows. He said, wouldn't it be nice to open one or two glass windows while building a new house? I said that the ethnic minorities in our area are not used to opening windows, and it is enough to open a skylight on the roof. In this way, he also respected our customs and did as I said. The government built five good houses for me in total, two for living, one for a warehouse, one for storing grass, and one for keeping livestock."

    The new houses built by the troops for the old folks were wider and stronger than the original ones. The wood was better than the original. The rotten door frames were replaced with new ones. In the original houses, the wood was directly placed on the earthen walls. When the walls collapsed, the houses also collapsed. This time, pillars were used for all the new houses. The troops were not able to build Kangs, so they learned from the old folks on the spot. The troop leaders often went to the construction site to check the progress of the construction. Whether it was a livestock pen, a thatched cottage, a melon cellar, or a reservoir, no matter how simple and dilapidated the old folks' original ones were, as long as they had them originally, they would be made new for the old folks and made well. When the old folks moved, the troops also mobilized some female comrades to first clean the old folks' new houses, and paste many pictures given by the troops on the walls. They also organized a Yangko team to bid farewell and organized the local ethnic minority people to welcome them. The troops allocated many horse-drawn carts with four horses to help the old folks move furniture, forage, and fertilizer.

    Since the troops came to Shajingzi, the relationship between the military and the civilians, as well as the ethnic relations, has been good. When the troops first came to the frontier to reclaim land, they received great help from the local old folks in terms of food, housing, production tools, and guiding the way to see the land. On the side of the troops, in the past few years, they have been enthusiastically helping the local old folks in terms of seeds, farm tools, water, and farming techniques. Especially water. After the Victory Canal was dug, the troops specifically allocated the East Branch 1 and East Branch 2 of the main canal to the old folks of Shajingzi. When the troops first arrived in Shajingzi, there were only dozens of old folks in the area. Because the troops came and water came, the number of people who moved to Shajingzi from all over gradually increased, and now it has increased to more than 300 households. The large-scale land reclamation by the troops has also driven the masses. In the past few years, the old folks in Shajingzi have also reclaimed a lot of wasteland. The farming techniques of the old folks in this area used to be relatively extensive. They used to broadcast seeds, but when the troops came, they taught them row planting. There was no habit of fertilizing in this area in the past, and the old folks did not understand the benefits of fertilizing. When they first saw the troops carrying small baskets to pick up manure everywhere, they felt strange. Later, when they saw the cotton fertilized by the troops, the cotton bolls were very large, and they believed in the benefits of fertilizing. Now the old folks have also begun to accumulate fertilizer and gradually switch to row planting.

    From September 1954, with the help of the troops, the old folks in Shajingzi successively established three agricultural production cooperatives, all using "Victory" as the name of the cooperative. When Victory Cooperative was established, the troops gave them four foreign plows and two seeders. The old folks were not used to using foreign plows at first, saying that the foreign plows could not be pulled by horses, and they preferred to use earthen plows. The troops sent soldiers to teach them how to use foreign plows. In the past, they used earthen plows to plow the land, which was shallow, and the grass could not be turned down. Using foreign plows to plow the land was deep, and the grass was turned down all at once. Later, everyone rushed to use foreign plows to plow the land. The troops not only helped train their people, but also helped train their horses. In the spring of 1955, the troops lent the horse-drawn ten-row seeders to the old folks. Their horses could not pull it, so the troops first lent their own horses to pull it, and then helped the cooperative train their horses.

    The troops' technical assistance to the old folks is comprehensive, not only guiding them in seed selection, row planting, inter-cultivation, furrow irrigation, fertilization, and weeding, but also guiding them in autumn plowing, winter irrigation, and spring harrowing to preserve moisture. The troops often lend seeders, cultivators, top-dressers, sprayers, etc. to the old folks. The troops also hold short-term training classes, and some members of the cooperative are also absorbed to participate in the study. Now, the general old folks have mastered the basic farming techniques for the three main crops of cotton, wheat, and corn. In 1955, the sixteen mu of high-yield cotton fields of Victory Cooperative produced 529 catties of seed cotton per mu, which was much higher than the production of individual households. After the Autumn Equinox, the income of cooperative members increased by an average of 49% compared with farmers outside the cooperative. Now the troops are helping the original Second and Third Cooperatives to transform into advanced cooperatives. For this reason, the troops have specifically established a "Local Work Section" with full-time cadres to help the old folks run advanced cooperatives. The director of the Political Department of the Production Corps said: "We ideologically regard the old folks' cooperatives as our own production units, and do our best to help them comprehensively. We will help them carry out comprehensive planning work. We have full confidence in helping them run advanced cooperatives well."
