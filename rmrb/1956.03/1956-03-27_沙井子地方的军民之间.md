    Between the Military and Civilians in Shajingzi
    Chu Anping
    The Shajingzi area, south of Aksu, was originally a barren滩, but since the troops began reclaiming it, it has now become the Victory Farm with a large area of 100,000 mu.

    In Xinjiang, water is the lifeline. As soon as the troops arrived here, they first tackled the fundamental problem of water. Starting in 1951, they spent more than two years digging the sixty-seven-kilometer-long Victory Canal through the hard Gobi Desert. While the troops were digging the canal, they were also carrying out the planning work for the farm. Before this, the troops had already reclaimed some land of better quality. In order to facilitate mechanized farming and water management, it was necessary to exchange this land and approximately 7,200 mu of land belonging to 261 local ethnic minority families within the planned area.

    In that land exchange, the troops took care of the interests of the local ethnic minority people in every way. The old folks got good land in exchange for good land, and even barren land could be exchanged for good land. The troops first led the old folks to see the land in various places, and the troops exchanged the land wherever the old folks wanted to exchange it. An old man named Rouzi Hasaff, because he had land elsewhere, refused to exchange land after he handed it over. The troop leaders believed that the people's land could not be accepted without compensation. So they sent people with ten fat sheep and 2,400 catties of corn to Rouzi Hasaff's home. The old man was so moved that he cried, saying that he used to be hungry often, but now his life is better, and he should help the People's Liberation Army establish a state-owned farm. Moreover, his land had been barren for many years, and the land was not good, so how could he accept such a generous gift. He refused to accept it. The people sent by the troops had no choice but to ask the village head to help persuade him, and the old man reluctantly accepted it. Another old man named Rouzi Jiejang did not have any labor at home, so he gave up the land in Shajingzi and did not want to exchange it again, so the troops sent him 5,000 catties of wheat. He used these 5,000 catties of wheat to open a Nang shop at the nearby Ayingkeba Bazaar. Later, whenever he saw soldiers in yellow clothes passing by, he would pull them into the shop to drink tea and eat Nang, saying, "This Nang was given to me by your troops."

    Some of the land had already grown winter wheat seedlings when it was exchanged. The troops calculated the amount of wheat to be returned to the old folks based on the highest possible yield of winter wheat from those lands. If there were tree seedlings on the land, the troops would pay the old folks in cash according to the prices stipulated by the government. In addition, the troops also gave more than 7,000 apricot and peach seedlings grown by themselves to the old folks. Those who handed over more land and wanted less land were also given agricultural tools such as hoes, sickles, and plows.

    Of the 261 ethnic minority families with land, 45 lived in Shajingzi. For these 45 families, the troops unconditionally built new houses for them and helped them move. The location of the houses and how they were built were all solicited from the owners in advance. I visited Misha, a technician at the Victory Agricultural Production Cooperative. Misha originally lived in two old houses, plus a thatched cottage, a stable, and a broken pen. When the houses were being built, the troops sent a translator and a designer to ask him how he wanted to build them. Misha said: "I chose the land, and the designer drew the drawings according to my ideas: where the door should be opened, where the Kang should be built, etc. The designer asked me where the windows should be opened? I said I don't want windows. He said, wouldn't it be nice to open one or two glass windows while building a new house? I said that the ethnic minorities in our area are not used to opening windows, and it is enough to open a skylight on the roof. In this way, he also respected our customs and did as I said. The government built five good houses for me in total, two for living, one for a warehouse, one for storing grass, and one for keeping livestock."

    The new houses built by the troops for the old folks were wider and stronger than the original ones. The wood was better than the original. The rotten door frames were replaced with new ones. In the original houses, the wood was directly placed on the earthen walls. When the walls collapsed, the houses also collapsed. This time, pillars were used for all the new houses. The troops were not able to build Kangs, so they learned from the old folks on the spot. The troop leaders often went to the construction site to check the progress of the construction. Whether it was a livestock pen, a thatched cottage, a melon cellar, or a reservoir, no matter how simple and dilapidated the old folks' original ones were, as long as they had them originally, they would be made new for the old folks and made well. When the old folks moved, the troops also mobilized some female comrades to first clean the old folks' new houses, and paste many pictures given by the troops on the walls. They also organized a Yangko team to bid farewell and organized the local ethnic minority people to welcome them. The troops allocated many horse-drawn carts with four horses to help the old folks move furniture, forage, and fertilizer.

    Since the troops came to Shajingzi, the relationship between the military and the civilians, as well as the ethnic relations, has been good. When the troops first came to the frontier to reclaim land, they received great help from the local old folks in terms of food, housing, production tools, and guiding the way to see the land. On the side of the troops, in the past few years, they have been enthusiastically helping the local old folks in terms of seeds, farm tools, water, and farming techniques. Especially water. After the Victory Canal was dug, the troops specifically allocated the East Branch 1 and East Branch 2 of the main canal to the old folks of Shajingzi. When the troops first arrived in Shajingzi, there were only dozens of old folks in the area. Because the troops came and water came, the number of people who moved to Shajingzi from all over gradually increased, and now it has increased to more than 300 households. The large-scale land reclamation by the troops has also driven the masses. In the past few years, the old folks in Shajingzi have also reclaimed a lot of wasteland. The farming techniques of the old folks in this area used to be relatively extensive. They used to broadcast seeds, but when the troops came, they taught them row planting. There was no habit of fertilizing in this area in the past, and the old folks did not understand the benefits of fertilizing. When they first saw the troops carrying small baskets to pick up manure everywhere, they felt strange. Later, when they saw the cotton fertilized by the troops, the cotton bolls were very large, and they believed in the benefits of fertilizing. Now the old folks have also begun to accumulate fertilizer and gradually switch to row planting.

    From September 1954, with the help of the troops, the old folks in Shajingzi successively established three agricultural production cooperatives, all using "Victory" as the name of the cooperative. When Victory Cooperative was established, the troops gave them four foreign plows and two seeders. The old folks were not used to using foreign plows at first, saying that the foreign plows could not be pulled by horses, and they preferred to use earthen plows. The troops sent soldiers to teach them how to use foreign plows. In the past, they used earthen plows to plow the land, which was shallow, and the grass could not be turned down. Using foreign plows to plow the land was deep, and the grass was turned down all at once. Later, everyone rushed to use foreign plows to plow the land. The troops not only helped train their people, but also helped train their horses. In the spring of 1955, the troops lent the horse-drawn ten-row seeders to the old folks. Their horses could not pull it, so the troops first lent their own horses to pull it, and then helped the cooperative train their horses.

    The troops' technical assistance to the old folks is comprehensive, not only guiding them in seed selection, row planting, inter-cultivation, furrow irrigation, fertilization, and weeding, but also guiding them in autumn plowing, winter irrigation, and spring harrowing to preserve moisture. The troops often lend seeders, cultivators, top-dressers, sprayers, etc. to the old folks. The troops also hold short-term training classes, and some members of the cooperative are also absorbed to participate in the study. Now, the general old folks have mastered the basic farming techniques for the three main crops of cotton, wheat, and corn. In 1955, the sixteen mu of high-yield cotton fields of Victory Cooperative produced 529 catties of seed cotton per mu, which was much higher than the production of individual households. After the Autumn Equinox, the income of cooperative members increased by an average of 49% compared with farmers outside the cooperative. Now the troops are helping the original Second and Third Cooperatives to transform into advanced cooperatives. For this reason, the troops have specifically established a "Local Work Section" with full-time cadres to help the old folks run advanced cooperatives. The director of the Political Department of the Production Corps said: "We ideologically regard the old folks' cooperatives as our own production units, and do our best to help them comprehensively. We will help them carry out comprehensive planning work. We have full confidence in helping them run advanced cooperatives well."

    沙井子地方的军民之间
    储安平
    阿克苏南面的沙井子地方，本来是一片荒滩，自经部队开垦以后，现在已经出现了一个十万亩大面积的胜利农场。
    在新疆，水是命根子。部队一到这儿，首先着手从根本上解决水的问题。从1951年起，花了两年多时间，穿过坚硬的戈壁地带，开凿了一条长达六十七公里的胜利渠。部队一面挖渠，一面进行农场的规划工作。在这以前，部队已经开垦了一些质量较好的土地，为了便于机耕和水利管理，需要把这些土地和在规划范围以内的261户民族老乡的共约七千二百多亩土地进行交换。
    在那次土地交换中，部队处处照顾着民族老乡的利益。老乡们的好地固然换到好地，就是荒地也可换到好地。部队先带领老乡到各处去看地，老乡希望交换哪儿的地，部队就尽可能换给他哪儿的地。有一个老汉叫肉孜哈萨夫，他因为别处还有土地，交出了土地后，硬不要再交换。部队首长认为，不能无偿地收受人民的土地。便派人带了十只肥羊和二千四百斤玉米送到肉孜哈萨夫家里。这个老汉感动得哭了起来，说他过去常常挨饿，现在生活好了，应该帮助解放军建立国营农场。况且他的地已荒了多年，地又不好，怎能接受这样的厚礼。他硬不肯收。部队派去的人没有办法，把乡长请来帮助劝说，老汉才勉强收下。另外有一个老汉叫肉孜街长的，家里没有劳动力，所以他把沙井子的地交出后也不要再交换，部队送了他五千斤麦子。他就用这五千斤麦子在附近的阿英克巴札上开了一个卖馕的铺子。后来他每看到路过的穿黄衣服的战士，都要拉他们进铺子喝茶吃馕，他说：“这馕就是你们部队送给我的。”
    有些土地在交换时已经长了冬麦苗，部队就按那些地最高能产多少斤冬麦的标准，用麦子算还给老乡；地上要是有树苗的，部队就按政府规定的价格，用现款付给老乡；此外，部队还把自己种的七千多株杏树苗和桃树送给了老乡。那些交的地多、要的地少的人，部队也都分别送了坎土镘、镰刀、犁等农具。
    在那261户有地的民族老乡中，有四十五户是住在沙井子的。对于这四十五户，部队无条件地给他们修盖新的屋子，帮他们搬家。房子盖在什么地方，要怎样盖，事先都分别征求了本主的意见。我访问了胜利农业生产合作社的技术员木沙。木沙住的本来是两间旧屋子，另外有一间草房，一间马圈和一间破牲圈。修房时，部队派了一个翻译，一个设计员去问他要怎样修。木沙说：“我选定了地，那个设计员就按照我的意思：门开在哪儿、炕砌在哪儿，一一画成了图样。设计员问我窗子开在哪儿？我说不要窗子。他说趁新盖屋子开一两个玻璃窗多好？我说我们这一带少数民族不习惯开窗，只要在屋顶上开个天窗就够了。这样，他也尊重我们的习惯，照我的意思办了。政府一共给我修了五间好房，两间住人，一间做仓库，一间装草，一间圈牲口。”
    部队给老乡新盖的房子，比原来的又宽大又结实。木料都比原来的好。烂门框都换了新门框。原来的房子，木头直接搭在土墙上，墙塌了，房也倒了。这次新盖的房，都用了柱子。部队战士本来不会砌炕，他们就向老乡现学。部队首长经常去现场检查修建的工程。无论是牲圈、草房、瓜窖、或者涝坝，不管老乡原有的是多么简单破陋，只要原来有的，都要给老乡新做，做得好好的。老乡搬家时，部队还发动了一些女同志先去把老乡的新屋子打扫得干干净净，把部队赠送的许多图画都贴在墙壁上。还组织了秧歌队欢送，组织当地的民族老乡偎郎欢迎。部队拨出很多辆用四套马拉的大车帮老乡搬家具，搬草料，肥料。
    部队来到沙井子以后，军民关系、同时也是民族关系，一直是好的。部队初到边疆垦地，条件困难，在吃、住、生产工具以及带路看地各方面，都得到当地老乡很大的帮助。在部队这一面，这几年来，无论是种籽、农具、用水以及耕作技术各方面，也一直给当地老乡以热情的帮助。尤其是用水。胜利渠挖通后，部队把一干渠的东一支和东二支这两条支渠专门划给沙井子的老乡使用。部队初到沙井子时，当地只有几十户老乡，由于部队来了，水也来了，从各地搬到沙井子来的人就渐渐多起来，现在已经增加到三百多户了。部队的大规模垦荒也带动了群众，这几年来沙井子的老乡也开了不少荒地。这一带老乡的耕作技术过去比较粗放。他们过去一直是撒播，部队来了就教他们条播。这一带过去本来没有施肥的习惯，老乡也不懂得施肥的好处。他们最初看到部队背着小筐到处拾粪，还觉得奇怪，后来看到部队施了肥的棉花，棉桃结得很大，他们才相信施肥的好处。现在老乡们也开始积肥和逐渐改用条播了。
    1954年9月起，沙井子老乡在部队的帮助下，先后成立了三个农业生产合作社，都用“胜利”作为社名。胜利一社成立的时候，部队送给他们四架洋犁和两个摇耧。老乡最初不习惯用洋犁，说洋犁马拉不动，宁愿仍旧用土犁。部队就派了战士去教他们掌握洋犁。过去他们用土犁犁地，犁得浅，草翻不下去，用洋犁犁地犁得深，一下子把草都翻下去了。后来大伙儿就都抢着要用洋犁犁地。部队不仅帮助训练他们的人，并且还帮助训练他们的马。1955年春天，部队把马拉十行播种机借给老乡使用。他们的马不会拉，部队就一面把自己的马先借给他们拉，一面再帮合作社训练他们的马。
    部队对于老乡的技术援助是全面进行的，不仅指导他们选种、条播、中耕、沟灌、施肥、除草，还指点他们进行秋翻冬灌和春耙保墒等项工作。部队经常把播种机、中耕机、追肥机、喷雾器等借给老乡使用。部队举办短期训练班，也都吸收合作社的一部分社员参加学习。现在在棉花、小麦、玉米这三项主要作物上，一般老乡也都已掌握了基本的耕作技术。1955年胜利一社的十六亩丰产棉田每亩生产了籽棉529斤，比单干户的生产量高出很多。秋分以后，社员的收入要比社外农民平均增加49％。现在部队正在帮助原有的二社、三社转办高级社。部队为此专门成立了一个“地方工作科”，有专职干部帮助老乡办高级社。生产部队的政治部主任说：“我们在思想上把老乡的合作社看成为我们自己的生产单位一样，尽一切力量全面地帮助他们。我们将帮助他们进行全面规划工作。我们对于帮助他们办好高级社是有着充分信心的。”
