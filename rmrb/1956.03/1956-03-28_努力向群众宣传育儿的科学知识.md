    Strive to Publicize Scientific Knowledge of Child Rearing to the Masses
    Li Hong
    With the rapid development of the country's economic construction, maternal and child health work has also greatly developed. In the past few years, many maternal and child health care institutions have been established across the country, the new method of delivery has been vigorously promoted, and free vaccinations have been universally implemented, effectively protecting the health of mothers and infants and reducing the mortality rate of newborns.
    However, due to the lack of in-depth and widespread publicity of health knowledge, the general public still generally lacks scientific knowledge of child rearing, and they still use unscientific old methods to raise their children. For example, among the residents of Chongqing, a more common phenomenon is that feeding is not on a regular schedule or in fixed amounts; children are fed whenever they cry; when milk is insufficient, children are given dry milk powder and snacks; weaning is delayed until two or three years old, and the weaning methods are very superstitious and barbaric. In some areas, when children get sick, they do not seek medical treatment from doctors, but use some very superstitious and unsanitary methods to treat the disease. In areas such as Lushun-Dalian and Heilongjiang, some people do not seek medical treatment for their children when they develop measles, but believe in so-called "earth rash," "silver rash," and "toad rash." When an "earth rash" appears, they let the child take off their pants and bury their lower body in the soil; when a "silver rash" appears, they scrape a little silver powder from an old woman's silver hairpin, mix it with water, and give it to the child to drink; when a "toad rash" appears, they drag a toad across the child's stomach. Some even give the child pig urine or black cow dung water to induce the rash. These situations show that how to raise children and enable them to grow up healthily is still a big problem at present.
    After agricultural cooperativization, the living standards of farmers have continuously improved. The vast majority of farmers not only hope to have children, but also hope that their children will grow up strong and healthy. Last year, I visited Wuxiang County in Shanxi Province. This is a cooperativized county, and it is also a county where the new method of delivery has been implemented well. The phenomenon of newborn deaths from tetanus is no longer common here, but every summer and autumn, children are constantly suffering from diarrhea, pneumonia, dysentery, and other common childhood diseases. Some children die from these infections. From January to May 1955, eleven children died in Zhaishang Township, six of whom died of pneumonia. The people in this township said: "There is a guarantee for giving birth to children, but raising children is even harder than finding gold in sand."
    Publicizing and popularizing scientific knowledge of child rearing, especially knowledge of the prevention and care of common childhood diseases, has become an urgent demand of the masses.
    In the past, some publicity of child-rearing knowledge was carried out in areas where the new method of delivery was promoted well, but many places did not pay attention to this publicity. The main reason is that some health workers and women's federation cadres do not see the relationship between publicizing child-rearing knowledge and developing production. They believe that if they do not do a good job in the central work, they will be criticized; no one will check whether they publicize the trivial matters of child rearing. Some people also believe that today's rural conditions are poor, and farmers' thinking is relatively conservative. It may not be accepted if publicity is carried out now, and even if it is accepted, it cannot be afforded, so it is better to take it slowly. These statements must be corrected.
    Let's look at the example of Sanhe Village in Shangzhi County, Heilongjiang. In the past, during the busy farming season in summer and autumn, many children in Sanhe Village suffered from diarrhea. Parents had to put down their work in the fields and go home to take care of their children, so they could not complete the agricultural production plan on time every year. For example, during the summer hoeing period in 1953, 55 women in the village were busy cutting and hoeing when suddenly 35 children suffered from diarrhea, and 38 women put down their production and went home to take care of their children. As a result, the production task could not be completed on time. Sanhe Village learned this lesson and vigorously promoted the publicity of child-rearing knowledge among the masses before the summer hoeing in 1954, with particular emphasis on publicizing methods of preventing diarrhea. This not only enabled male and female farmers to understand some scientific knowledge of child rearing, but also made them consciously teach their children to develop hygienic habits, such as eating at regular times, not eating unclean things, and not drinking raw water. As a result, from summer hoeing to autumn harvest, only three or four children in the village suffered from mild diarrhea, and they recovered quickly. The mothers of seventy children all participated in production, and the production tasks were also completed on time.
    Some cadres in some areas have a serious tendency to be divorced from reality and impatient in the publicity of child-rearing knowledge, and the effect is not good. Some cadres do not deeply understand the living standards of the local people and what is produced locally. They subjectively promote that drinking milk, eating liver paste, and taking vitamins can make children grow up strong, and as a result, the masses respond very coldly. They said: "What the comrades said is good, but it can't be done." "What is a health tree (vitamin)? We haven't seen it. My family has willow trees and poplar trees." Some comrades think that after one publicity campaign, the masses will immediately do it in the same way. Once the masses do not do it according to their publicity, they are neither patient enough to repeatedly publicize and explain to the masses, nor do they check the reasons why the masses cannot accept it and the shortcomings in the publicity work. Instead, they complain that the masses are conservative and backward, and no longer actively publicize it.
    The publicity of child-rearing knowledge is a long-term and meticulous work of "changing customs and habits." It must proceed from reality, conduct in-depth investigations and research among the masses, and use various opportunities and methods to teach child-rearing knowledge to the masses in a way that is in line with reality, according to different regions, different conditions, and different situations. In order to do this publicity well, it is hoped that relevant departments will compile more popular and easy-to-understand booklets for the vast number of grassroots women cadres, agricultural cooperative cadres, and rural and street activists to study. Only in this way can the new generation grow up healthily, and the vast number of women can participate in production without any worries.

    努力向群众宣传育儿的科学知识
    李虹
    随着国家经济建设事业的飞跃发展，妇幼卫生工作也有了很大的开展。几年来，全国范围内建立了不少妇幼保健机构，大力推广了新法接生，普遍实行了免费预防接种等等，有效地保护了妇婴的健康，降低了新生儿的死亡率。
    但是，由于卫生知识的宣传工作不深入，不普遍，广大群众还普遍缺乏科学的育儿知识，他们仍然沿用着不科学的老办法抚育孩子。例如在重庆市的居民中，较普遍的现象就是喂奶没有定时，没有定量，孩子一吵就吃；奶不够就给孩子吃干奶，吃零食；两三岁才断奶，断奶的方法非常迷信、野蛮。有些地区孩子生了病不去请医生诊治，而是用一些非常迷信的不卫生的办法去治病。旅大市、黑龙江等地区，有的群众在孩子出麻疹的时候不请医生治，而迷信于什么麻疹有“土疹”、“白银疹”、“蛤蟆疹”。出了“土疹”就让孩子脱掉裤子把下身埋在土里；出了“白银疹”就从老太太的银簪上刮下一点银粉冲水给孩子喝；出了“蛤蟆疹”就用一个蛤蟆在小孩肚子上拖来拖去。甚至有的为了发疹子给孩子喝猪尿或黑牛粪水。这些情况说明，如何抚养孩子，使他们健康地成长起来，在目前还是一个很大的问题。
    农业合作化以后，农民生活水平不断提高。广大农民不仅希望有孩子，而且希望孩子长得很健壮。去年我曾到过山西省的武乡县。这是一个合作化了的县，同时也是新法接生推行得较好的县，这里新生儿死于破伤风的现象已不多了，但是，每年夏秋季节却不断有孩子患腹泻、肺炎、痢疾和其他幼儿常见的疾病。有的孩子因感染了这些病而夭亡。寨上乡1955年一月至五月死了十一个孩子，其中有六个是患肺炎死的。这个乡的群众说：“生孩子有了保障，可是带孩子比沙里澄金还难。”
    宣传普及科学的育儿知识，特别是小儿常见的疾病的预防护理知识，已经成为广大群众当前的迫切要求了。
    在过去一段时间里，在新法接生工作推行得较好的地区曾经做过一些育儿知识的宣传，但有许多地方没有重视这一宣传。主要原因是一些卫生工作人员、妇联干部看不见宣传育儿知识和发展生产之间的关系，他们认为做不好中心工作，要挨批评；育儿之类的婆婆妈妈的事不宣传也没人检查。也有一些人认为今天的农村条件差，农民的思想比较保守，现在宣传不一定能接受，即使能接受也讲究不起，还是慢慢来吧。这些说法都必须加以纠正。
    让我们看看黑龙江尚志县三合村的例子。三合村过去一到夏秋农忙季节，村里的孩子患腹泻的很多，父母们不得不放下田里的活计回家照顾孩子，因此年年不能按时完成农业生产计划。如1953年夏锄时期，全村五十五名妇女正在忙割忙垧，忽然有三十五个孩子患腹泻，有三十八个妇女便放下了生产回家照顾孩子，结果未能按时完成生产任务。三合村接受了这一教训，在1954年夏锄前就在群众中大力展开了育儿知识的宣传，特别着重宣传了预防腹泻的方法，不仅使男女农民懂得了一些科学的育儿知识，并且使他们自觉地教孩子养成卫生习惯，如按顿吃饭，不干净的东西不吃，不喝生水等等，结果，全村从夏锄到秋收，只有三、四个孩子患轻度腹泻，并且很快就好了，七十个孩子的母亲都参加了生产，生产任务也按时完成了。
    有些地区的干部在育儿知识的宣传上，有严重的脱离实际的倾向和急躁情绪，效果不好。有的干部不深入了解当地群众的生活水平和当地生产什么，主观地宣传喝牛奶、吃肝泥、维生素就能使孩子长得健壮，结果群众反映很冷淡。他们说：“同志们讲的好是好，就是办不到。”“什么卫生树（维生素），我们没见过，我家有柳树、杨树。”有些同志想着宣传一次以后，群众就马上照样做起来，一旦群众没有照他们宣传的去做，他们既不能耐心地反复向群众宣传解释，也不检查群众不能接受的原因和宣传工作中的缺点，却在那里埋怨群众保守、落后，不再积极宣传了。
    育儿知识的宣传工作是一个长期的、细致的“移风易俗”的工作，必须从实际出发，深入群众进行调查研究，根据不同地区，不同条件，不同情况，运用各种机会，通过各种方式切合实际地把育儿知识教给群众。为了把这一宣传做好，希望有关部门多编这方面的通俗易懂的小册子供广大的基层妇女干部、农业合作社的干部、农村和街道积极分子学习。只有这样，新的一代才能健康地成长起来，广大妇女才能无所牵挂地参加生产。
