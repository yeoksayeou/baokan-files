    Qi Jianfang, an advanced shuttle-changing female worker at the state-owned Zhengzhou No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, has recently successfully created the "No Waste Thread Shuttle Method." This operating method eliminates the waste thread that inevitably occurs with traditional shuttle changes. At the same time, because there is no need to wind the yarn onto the "horns" when loading the shuttle tube, this device on the loom has also been removed. This method has now been implemented on 180 looms in the factory's weaving workshop. According to calculations, if the "No Waste Thread Shuttle Method" is fully promoted throughout the factory, more than 4,000 pounds of cotton yarn can be saved each year.

    齐剑芳创造“无回丝摆梭法”
    国营郑州第一棉纺织厂先进摆梭女工齐剑芳，最近又创造成功“无回丝摆梭法”。这种操作法消灭了历来摆梭必然产生的回丝，同时由于装梭管的时候不需要往“羊角”上绕纱的操作，因而织布机上的这个装置也被去掉了。现在这个厂的织布车间里，已经在180台布机上推行了这个办法。据计算，这个厂全部推广“无回丝摆梭法”以后，每年可以节约四千多磅棉纱。（据新华社讯）
