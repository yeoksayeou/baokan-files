    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, March 3rd. More than 100 engineering and technical personnel from the Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company's Steelmaking Construction Engineering Company have put themselves into the socialist competition with practical actions.
    In formulating this year's construction plan, the company's engineering and technical personnel went deep into the construction sites to extensively absorb the opinions of workers and carefully studied construction technical measures, which not only increased this year's construction workload by 40% compared to the original plan, but also shortened the construction period of 34 projects. The engineering and technical personnel responsible for the technical guidance of the chemical system construction projects re-studied the construction technical measures, which can enable the completion of two key projects under construction several months ahead of schedule this year, and the two key projects originally planned to start construction next year can also start construction this year in advance.
    The company's engineering and technical personnel have also put forward a large number of rationalization proposals. Engineer Dong Guangrong put forward four important rationalization proposals in one day on February 24. The coke screening building project, which was originally planned to start construction in August this year and be completed in April next year, can start construction in April and be completed 7 months ahead of schedule in September this year after adopting the new construction methods proposed by engineer Zhou Caizhang and others.

    鞍山炼钢工程公司技术人员投入竞赛
    新华社鞍山3日电　鞍山钢铁建设公司炼钢建筑工程公司100多名工程技术人员，用实际行动投入了社会主义竞赛。
    在制定今年的施工计划中，这个公司的工程技术人员深入工地广泛吸收职工的意见，周密研究施工技术措施，不仅使今年的建筑工作量比原计划增加了40％，而且把34项工程的施工工期都缩短了。担任化工系统建设工程技术指导责任的工程技术人员们，重新研究了施工技术措施，可以使今年施工的两个重点工程提前好几个月建成，原计划在明年开工建设的两个重点工程也可以提前在今年动工。
    这个公司的工程技术人员还提出了大量合理化建议。工程师董光礽在2月24日一天里就提出四件重要合理化建议。原计划在今年8月开工、到明年4月建成的筛焦楼工程，采纳了工程师周彩章等提出的新的施工方法以后，可以使这个工程在4月份动工、提前7个月在今年9月份建成。
