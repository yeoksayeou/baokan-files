Chongqing's 300,000 industrial workers have launched an unprecedented socialist competition. Of the city's 38 large factories and mines, 28 have proposed striving to complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. On February 19th, labor models and advanced producers of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company initiated an advanced producer movement, and to date, workers from 24 enterprises in the city have responded to this initiative.

During the competition, many workers went to the director's office and the Party committee to request the promulgation of higher technical and economic norms. In the second half of February, workers in more than 10 types of work at the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, such as steelmaking, steel rolling, and ironmaking, continuously created 117 new records. Small open-hearth furnaces achieved a daily output of 16 furnaces, surpassing the planned production level for 1957 and completing the February plan two and a half days ahead of schedule. From New Year's Day to February 20th, the main equipment of the Chongqing Cement Plant created 50 new records, and three-quarters of the main equipment exceeded the planned production level for 1957. The total output value of the Chongqing Universal Machine Factory has exceeded the planned production level for 1957 by 30%. The Chongqing Daxi溝 Power Plant, which had relatively backward production technology half a year ago, completed the January national plan 8 days ahead of schedule. The factories under the Chongqing Local Industry Bureau performed very well in February, even though the plan was higher than in January.

In this competition, the socialist competition principle of advanced helping the backward, the backward learning from the advanced, and striving to surpass the advanced has been implemented relatively universally. Since 1953, the Wang Guisen bricklaying team of the Chongqing Construction Industry has maintained the highest bricklaying record in the city by studying the Su Changyou bricklaying method. In January, the young worker Yang Changshi created a new bricklaying method, exceeding the national unified quota by one and a half times, and surpassing the Wang Guisen team. Bricklaying workers throughout the city launched a competition to learn from Yang Changshi and strive to surpass him. After visiting Yang Changshi's performance, the Zeng Zigao Youth Commando improved its operating methods, and two members exceeded Yang Changshi's record. The bricklaying efficiency of various types of bricklaying in the city's construction industry generally exceeded the national unified quota by 90% to 100%. During the competition, the workers of the refractory materials workshop of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company learned from each other and helped each other. The previous shift prepared for the next shift's production and supported the next shift in creating new records. The disputes during shift handover that were previously not well handled with orders and regulations, and the mutual complaints caused by failure to complete the plan, have now been swept away.

In order to achieve "more, faster, better, and more economical," the workers generated a strong desire to learn advanced experience and master new technologies. According to incomplete statistics from Tianfu Coal Mine and three thermal power plants in January, a total of 48 relatively significant advanced experiences were promoted. The Tianfu Coal Mine No. 1 well promoted the advanced experience of cyclic operation, which increased production by 41%. In the past, the quality of cotton yarn in Chongqing's textile mills rarely reached Grade A. This year, in order to improve the quality of cotton yarn, each factory promoted 6 types of advanced experience, and the quality of cotton yarn in several factories has reached Grade A. The workers of the Chongqing Transportation Company of Sichuan Province promoted the advanced experience of safely and economically using gasoline. From February 1st to 20th, the fuel consumption of 151 drivers and units/groups was lower than the new quota set in 1956, saving a total of more than 6,000 liters of gasoline. In order to effectively promote advanced experience and implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, many factories and mining enterprises have made comprehensive plans in this regard, and at the same time, paid attention to the timely dissemination of the experience of advanced producers. The Chongqing Third Construction Engineering Company is summarizing the bricklaying experience of advanced producers and compiling a set of operating regulations to promote it comprehensively.

After listening to the central government's report on intellectual problems, the vast number of engineering and technical personnel deeply felt the care of the Party and the government for them, and were determined to fully contribute their strength to the cause of socialist construction. Sun Fangxuan, Bao Qiguo, and other 17 engineers of the Southwest First Construction Engineering Company proposed an initiative to launch a socialist competition to engineers in national construction and installation enterprises and design units. The suggestions made by engineering and technical personnel have greatly increased, and many of them are major suggestions. The engineering and technical personnel of the steelmaking workshop made 13 suggestions in less than two months. Deng Xihao, an intern, suggested using the waste sulfuric acid used to clean steel to extract ferrous sulfate, which has been successfully tested and can save 320,000 yuan per year.

In the face of the ever-increasing socialist competition, the management personnel of various factories and mining enterprises are actively taking measures to adapt to the new situation. The deputy secretary of the Party committee of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company said: "Now the socialist competition is rising wave after wave, climax after climax. The leadership methods of regular meetings and reports can no longer adapt to today's situation." The chairman of the trade union of the Chongqing Third Construction Engineering Company said: "In the past, the competition was promoted from above to below, but today it is promoted from below to above. In the past, breaking quotas was only a matter for a few activists, but what about today? Everyone wants to break the quota."

    社会主义竞赛不断高涨的重庆
    本报记者　李策
    重庆市30万产业职工开展了空前规模的社会主义竞赛。全市38个大型厂矿，有28个已经提出要争取提前完成第一个五年计划。2月19日，重庆钢铁公司劳动模范和先进生产者倡议开展先进生产者运动，到现在，全市已经有24个企业的职工响应了这个倡议。
    在竞赛中，许多工人到厂长办公室和党委会去要求颁布更高的技术经济定额。2月下半月，重庆钢铁公司的炼钢、轧钢、炼铁等10多个工种的工人们，连续创造了117个新纪录。小型平炉做到了日产16炉，突破1957年的计划生产水平，提前两天半完成了2月份计划。重庆水泥厂从元旦到2月20日，主要设备共创造了50次新纪录，有四分之三的主要设备突破了1957年计划生产水平。重庆通用机器厂的总产值已经超过1957年计划生产水平30％。半年以前生产技术比较落后的重庆大溪沟发电厂，提前8天完成1月份国家计划。重庆地方工业局所属各厂，2月份计划比1月份高，但是仍然完成得很好。
    在这一次竞赛中，比较普遍地贯彻执行了先进帮助落后，落后向先进看齐，并且努力赶过先进的社会主义竞赛原则。重庆建筑业王桂森砌砖小组从1953年学习苏长有砌砖法以来，一直保持全市砌砖的最高纪录。1月份，青年工人杨长诗创造新砌砖法，超过了全国统一定额一倍半，超过了王桂森小组。全市砌砖工人展开了向杨长诗学习，并且争取超过他的竞赛运动。曾子高青年突击队参观杨长诗表演以后，又改进操作方法，有两个队员超过了杨长诗的纪录。全市建筑业各种类型的砌砖工效一般突破了全国统一定额90％到100％。重庆钢铁公司耐火材料车间工人在竞赛中，各班互相学习，互相帮助，上一班替下一班做好生产准备，支持下一班创造新纪录。以前用命令、制度处理不好的交接班的纠纷，由于完不成计划而产生的互相抱怨情绪，现在一扫而光。
    工人们为了做到“又多、又快、又好、又省”，产生了强烈的学习先进经验和掌握新技术的愿望。据天府煤矿和三个火力发电厂1月份不完全的统计，共推广了48项较重大的先进经验。天府煤矿一井推广循环作业的先进经验，提高了产量41％。重庆各纺织厂的棉纱质量，以前很少达到甲级品，今年各厂为了提高棉纱质量，推广了6种先进经验，若干工厂的棉纱质量已经达到了甲级品。四川省重庆运输公司职工推广了安全节约汽油的先进经验，从2月1日到20日，有151个驾驶员和单位、小组的汽车用油比1956年新定额还低，共节约汽油6，000多公升。为了有效地推广先进经验，执行苏联专家建议，许多厂矿企业，都做出了这方面的全面规划，同时，注意了及时传播先进生产者的经验。重庆市第三建筑工程公司正在总结先进生产者的砌砖经验，编制一套操作规程，以便全面推广。
    广大的工程技术人员听了中央关于知识分子问题的报告以后，深深感到党和政府对他们的关怀，决心在社会主义建设事业中充分贡献自己的力量。西南第一建筑工程公司孙方烜、包其国等17位工程师，向全国建筑安装企业和设计单位的工程师们提出了开展社会主义竞赛的倡议。工程技术人员提出的建议大大增加了，其中有很多是重大建议。炼钢车间的工程技术人员不到两个月提了13件建议，实习生邓锡浩建议利用洗过钢材的废硫酸提炼绿矾，已经试验成功，每年可以节约32万元。
    在社会主义竞赛不断高涨的面前，各厂矿企业管理人员积极采取措施来适应新的情况。重庆钢铁公司党委副书记说：“现在社会主义竞赛是一浪推一浪，高潮接着高潮，靠定期会议、表报的领导方法已经不能适应今天的形势了。”重庆第三建筑工程公司工会主席说：“过去开展竞赛是上边推下边，今天是下边推上边。过去突破定额只是少数积极分子的事，而今天呢？人人都想突破定额。”
