Success in Producing Rimmed Steel Using Acid Bessemer Converters
    The electric furnace workshop of Daye Steel Plant, learning from Soviet experience, has successfully trial-produced rimmed steel using acid Bessemer converters. In the five heats of steel trial-produced over the past month or so, four heats were completely up to standard. The successful trial production of rimmed steel can not only greatly improve the quality of Bessemer converter steel ingots but also increase production by 7.86% and reduce costs by 5.38%.
