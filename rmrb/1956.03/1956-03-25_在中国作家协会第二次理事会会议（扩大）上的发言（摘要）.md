Speech (Excerpt) at the Second Council Meeting (Expanded) of the Chinese Writers Association
Ba Jin
I can't remember when I started being called a writer. The first time I picked up a pen to write a novel, it was simply because I had things I couldn't say, emotions I couldn't express, and love and hate I had to pour out. I couldn't settle my troubled heart without writing. However, after I was called a writer, I felt a heavy burden on my shoulders, and my sense of responsibility increased. Especially after the national liberation, I realized even more clearly that I was not worthy of the title of writer. If we acknowledge that writer is a glorious title, we must produce good works to avoid betraying this title and betraying this era that everyone cannot help but love.

Creation is a very serious and arduous undertaking. Even the most talented people have to pay a great price for creation. This price includes diligent labor, rich life experience and knowledge, a correct worldview, and a considerable amount of time. We all know that even the most talented people cannot fabricate life out of thin air; a writer who has never seen a heroic figure cannot write a hero, even if he understands the problem of whether or not to write about shortcomings. Life is the source of creation. However, without a correct worldview, he cannot correctly understand and analyze life. He will waste all his energy on superficial phenomena, and even if he sees heroic figures, he will not recognize their heroism.

Any job requires intense labor, and writing is no exception. But we can make ten thousand identical chairs, or make a hundred cloisonné vases according to a beautiful design, but we cannot write a novel with the same content as a previously published work. There must be something of the author's own in the creation. Complete imitation is not creation. I am not saying that creation is not a collective undertaking. On the contrary, I emphasize that creation is a collective undertaking and not entirely the author's personal undertaking. But creation is individual labor, and works have individuality. Moreover, the content of the work and the era and environment in which the writer lives are also closely related. Even writers with the same correct worldview will have different working methods; even living in the same environment, they will reflect life from different angles. I say that creation is a collective undertaking because any genius writer must rely on the society at the time and the people living in the society, and will be influenced by all kinds of people. Writers have no reason to demand to retain every article or book they write. On the contrary, they must demand themselves to seriously and earnestly use all their energy to engage in their work. Even if a writer has written ten good works, he should still put all his energy into writing his eleventh novel as if he were a beginner. For writers, learning is endless.

If everyone thinks that the above statement makes some sense, then please allow me to say one of my conclusions: Let a person engaged in creation have enough time, at least enough time to pick up a pen and write a few words, and also have time to brew and think before picking up the pen. There was a time when railway stations and airports had become the reception rooms for several of us (writers and musicians), and running twice a day was commonplace. I admit that this work is very meaningful, and when I visit foreign countries, foreign friends also pick me up and see me off at stations and airports. I also believe that writers must participate in various social activities. But I am more in favor of Premier Zhou Enlai's method of guaranteeing six-fifths of the time for business activities. Writers need time to write works, not just a few scattered hours or days, but a longer period. Writing also requires intense, selfless labor. Haste is never the way to success. We only need to look at a page of Tolstoy's manuscript to know what kind of labor creation requires. To prosper creation and improve the quality of creation, writers must spend more time on their work. The learning and transformation of writers are very important, and learning and transformation are of great help to every writer's work, but they must also be combined with the writer's creative activities to produce results. Writers will not make progress if they leave creative practice. Writers must constantly write. Writing is his work and his obligation. What the vast readers ask of writers is: works, more works, and better works. Creation is a collective undertaking. Therefore, it is not enough to just blame and expect writers; let all those who care about creation work together to help writers complete the cause of literary creation, which is part of the great cause of socialist construction in China.

In the past two days, we each have five books in our hands, which are selected collections of poetry, prose, novels, drama, and children's literature compiled by the Chinese Writers Association. These collections make each of us very happy, not just because the binding is good and the printing is good, but mainly because the content of these five books shines with the golden light of socialist literature. The articles selected in these five books are solid, substantive, beautiful, and reflect the earth-shaking historical changes of our socialist country. Another feature is that although the old writers tirelessly write good articles, most of the colorful and passionate works are written by young writers. Naturally, in addition to these five collections, there are many excellent long works that have been loved by the masses. All these works make us feel that a new and truly prosperous socialist literary era is about to arrive.

However, saying that such an era will inevitably come does not mean that it has already arrived. We need to make great efforts, as the meeting called for, to shoulder the great task of building socialist literature.

In our works, there are still some serious shortcomings. We still involuntarily and sometimes commit the faults of formulaization and conceptualization. I clearly know that it is absolutely impossible to write articles in a conceptualized way, but when I don’t know much about the object I want to write about or I don’t understand it deeply enough, the evil spirit of formulaization and conceptualization will unknowingly drill into my pen. At the same time, when I am vague about the ideological significance of a character or an event, I will naturally seek help from a certain formulaic solution. Underneath formulaization and conceptualization, there is often a lack of ideological level and a lack of life knowledge. I think that since formulaized and conceptualized things are not true, then if I want to be an honest and diligent writer, I should not commit such faults. The tendency of formulaized and conceptualized writing will make us lazy, make us gradually forget the spirit of originality, and make us forget that a writer should write something only when he has real feelings, and should not stubbornly stick to a policy or a movement process and talk about monotonous stories. If you thoroughly understand something, this thorough understanding will bring us our own original views. The excellent works that have appeared in the past two years that have been loved by the people have all, without exception, displayed the characteristics of originality. They have vivid and prominent heroic images, in line with the laws of life and truth, but also novel and refined, with captivating plots, and full of socialist enthusiasm, which have educated us and made us unforgettable for a long time.

I completely agree with Comrade Zhou Yang's point that our writing shortcomings are not only formalism, but also naturalism. Recently, we have indeed seen some descriptions of the lives of positive characters on the stage, because the audience can no longer endure things on the stage that are only workshops, group meetings, research on working methods, ideological analysis, and endless discussions. So life comes out, slowly drinking tea, making dumplings, and young pioneers constantly singing and telling stories. We are not saying that these life details should not be written, the question is what are we writing these things for? However, some of our playwrights are always too busy collecting some life details and piling them on the stage, forgetting that they should choose the most moving details for a purpose, constantly polish them, and make these details able to centrally express the real drama. The tendency of naturalism will make an author put many things on the stage that do not smell like drama at all. What is exciting in the past two years is that some scripts with high ideological content and strong artistic quality have indeed appeared on our stage. They rely on real and dramatic characters, soul-stirring dramatic scenes, tense and attractive atmosphere, strong life atmosphere, and relatively tight structure to satisfy the audience and make them feel truly happy. From the excited, happy, and excited emotions, they are fully aware that there is a force on the stage that makes them unable to restrain themselves from moving forward.

Our drama team has indeed grown unprecedentedly. Before liberation, there were only two or thirty Chinese spoken drama authors, which was really pitifully few. But what about today? One comrade calculated that there are still more than a dozen older playwrights, more than forty middle-aged playwrights, four or five hundred young playwrights, and more than three thousand amateur playwrights. In the history of Chinese drama for two thousand years, which era could have such a huge creative force? Our plays today have produced unforgettable positive characters full of a high degree of socialist revolutionary spirit. In our plays, communist morality, the real life atmosphere of the people, and enthusiastic struggles have become the main and prominent features. Comrade Zhou Yang said: We should create works that are worthy of being great, or at least lay a good foundation for producing great works. His words not only express the people's demands on us, but also express our own wishes.

    在中国作家协会第二次理事会会议（扩大）上的发言（摘要）
    巴金
    我已经记不清楚我是从什么时候起被人称为作家的。我第一次拿起笔写小说，只是因为我有话讲不出来，有感情没法宣泄，有爱憎必须倾吐。我不写就没法安顿我那颗痛苦的心。然而等到我被人称为作家以后，我就觉得我的肩头挑上了沉重的担子，我的责任感也加重了。特别是在全国解放以后，我更清楚地感觉到我不配接受作家这个称号。如果承认作家是一个光荣的称号，我们就必须拿出好作品来，免得辜负这个称号，免得辜负这个任何人不能不热爱的时代。
    创作是一个很严肃、很艰苦的事业。即使是最有才能的人也得在创作上付出很大的代价，这个代价包含着辛勤的劳动，丰富的生活经验与知识，正确的世界观，还包含着相当长的一段时间。我们都知道，连最有才能的人也不能凭空捏造生活；一个从未见过英雄人物的作家，即使搞通了写不写缺点的问题也写不出一个英雄来。生活是创作的泉源。然而没有正确的世界观，他就没法正确地认识生活，分析生活，他会把全副精力消耗在表面的现象上面，他即使见到英雄人物，他也不会认出英雄气概来。
    任何工作都需要强度的劳动，写作也不是例外，但是我们可以造一万把式样完全相同的椅子，或者照一个美观的图样做一百个景泰蓝花瓶，我们却不可以写一篇内容和已发表作品相同的小说。创作里必须有作者自己的东西。完全摹仿就不是创作了。我并不是说创作不是集体的事业。相反的，我强调地说，创作是集体的事业，而且完全不是作者个人的事业。但是创作是个人的劳动，作品是有个性的。而且作品的内容和作家生活在其中的时代与环境也有很大的关系。即使是具有同样正确世界观的作家，也会有各人不同的工作方法；即使生活在相同的环境里面，也会从各个不同的角度来反映生活。我说创作是集体的事业，因为任何天才的作家也得依靠当时的社会和在社会中生活的人，也会从各种各样的人那里受到影响。作家没有理由要求保留他写出来的每一篇文章或每一本书，相反地他得要求自己严肃认真地使用全副精力从事他的工作。一个作家即使写过十部好作品，但是他写第十一本小说的时候，他还是应当像初学写作者那样拿出他的全副精力。对于作家来说，学习是没有止境的。
    倘使大家认为以上的说法还有一点道理，那么请允许我说出我的一个结论来：让一个从事创作的人有充分的时间，至少也得有拿起笔写完若干字的时间，而且也得有执笔以前的酝酿、思索的时间。有一个时期，火车站和飞机场已经成了我们几个人（有作家也有音乐家）的会客室了，一天跑两次也是常事。我承认这种工作很有意义，而且我出国访问，外国朋友们也在车站、机场接送。我也认为作家必须参加各种社会活动。但是我更拥护周恩来总理提出的保证六分之五的时间从事业务活动的办法。作家写作品需要时间，这不是零零碎碎的几小时或几天，这应当是一个较长的时期。写作也需要强度的、忘我的劳动。草率决不是成功的方法，我们单单看一页托尔斯泰的手稿就知道创作需要着什么样的劳动了。要繁荣创作，要提高创作的质量，就得让作家在自己的工作上多花工夫。作家的学习和改造都是非常重要的，学习和改造对每个作家的工作都有很大的帮助，但是它们也得跟作家的创作活动结合起来，才可以产生效果。作家离开了创作实践，是不会有进步的。作家必须不断地写作。写作是他的工作，也是他的义务。广大读者向作家要求的是：作品，更多的作品，而且更好的作品。创作是集体的事业。因此对于作家单是责备和期望是不够的；让所有关心创作的人一齐努力，帮助作家完成文学创作的事业，这个事业是伟大的中国社会主义建设事业的一部分。
    曹禺
    这两天我们每个人的手里有五本书，是中国作家协会编选的诗歌、散文、小说、戏剧和儿童文学的选集。这几本集子使我们每个人都很高兴，不只是因为装订好，印刷好，主要的是因为这五本书的内容闪着社会主义文学的金光。这五本书所选的文章是结实的，有内容的，优美的，反映了我国社会主义翻天覆地的历史变革。另外一个特色就是，老作家虽然不倦怠地写出好文章来，但绝大部分色彩鲜明、热情澎湃的作品是青年作家们写的。自然，除了这五本集子以外，更有许多优秀的长篇作品得到了群众的热爱。所有这些作品都使我们感到新的真正繁荣的社会主义的文学时代就要到来。
    但是，说这样的时代必然来到，并不等于它已经来到了。我们需要作很大的努力，像会议所号召的，把建设社会主义文学的伟大任务担在我们的肩上。
    在我们的作品中，还存在着一些严重的缺点。我们还不由自主地有时犯着公式化概念化的毛病。我明明知道写文章万万不可概念化，但是当我对我要写的对象知道得不多或者了解得不深的时候，公式化概念化这股邪气不知不觉就会钻到笔下来了。同时，当我对一个人物，一件事情的思想意义模糊的时候，我就自然而然地求救于某种一定公式的解决方法。在公式化概念化的下面，经常掩盖着思想水平的低下和生活知识的贫乏。我想，公式化概念化的东西既然是不真实的，那么，如果我要成为一个老老实实勤勤恳恳的作家，我就不应该犯这样的毛病。公式化概念化的写作倾向会使我们懒惰，使我们渐渐忘记独创的精神，使我们忘记了一个作家应该是有了真正的感受才写出东西的，而不应该是死钉着一个政策或者一个运动的过程，絮絮叨叨地说着千篇一律的故事。凡对一件东西透彻地了解了，这个透彻的了解就会给我们带来自己的独创的看法。这两年出现的优秀的获得人民喜爱的作品，都是无例外地发挥了独创的特点，它们以鲜明突出的英雄形象，合乎生活真实的规律，但又新颖脱俗，引人入胜的情节，和饱满的社会主义热情，教育了我们，使我们长久不能忘记。
    我完全同意周扬同志指出来我们写作的缺点不只有公式主义，还有自然主义的倾向。最近我们在舞台上确实看到一些描写正面人物的生活，因为观众不能再忍受舞台上仅仅是车间、小组会、工作方法的研究、思想分析、无穷无尽的讨论这类东西，于是生活出来了，在台上慢慢地喝茶，包饺子，红领巾不断地唱歌讲故事。我们不是说这些生活的细节不该写，问题在于写了这些东西究竟是为了什么？但是，我们有些剧作者总是过于匆忙地搜集一些生活细节，堆在台上，忘记了应该为了一个目的选择最动人的细节，加以不断的锤炼，使这些细节能够集中地表现出真正的戏来。自然主义的倾向，会使一个作者把许多闻不出一点戏的味道的东西搬上舞台。最近这两年，令人兴奋的是我们舞台上确实出现了一些思想性高，艺术性强的剧本，它们靠了真实的富有戏剧性的人物，撼动人心的戏剧场面，紧张吸引人的气氛，强烈的生活气息，同比较严密的结构，使观众得到满足，感到真正的快乐，从兴奋、快乐、激动的情绪当中，充实地感到舞台上有一种使他抑制不住地向前迈进的力量。
    我们的戏剧队伍确实空前壮大起来了。解放以前，中国的话剧作者不过是二、三十个，真是少得可怜。然而今天呢？有一位同志算了一算，老一点的剧作家仍然是十几个，中一辈的就有四十多，青年剧作者有四五百个，业余的剧作者有三千多个。中国两千年来的戏剧史上，哪一个时代能够拥有这样巨大的创作力量？我们今天的剧作里已经产生了令人不能忘怀的，充满了高度社会主义革命精神的正面人物，在我们的剧作里，共产主义的道德，人民的真实的生活气息和热烈的斗争，已经成为主要的突出的特征。周扬同志说：我们应该创造出够得上伟大的作品，至少为产生伟大的作品打下良好的基础。他的话不但说出人民对我们的要求，也说出我们自己的愿望。
