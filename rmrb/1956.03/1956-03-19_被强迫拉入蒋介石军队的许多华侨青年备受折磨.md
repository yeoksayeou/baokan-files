Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 18th: Many overseas Chinese youths who were lured to Taiwan by the Chiang Kai-shek clique and forcibly drafted into Chiang Kai-shek's army are suffering cruel torment in the Chiang army. This was told to our reporter by Zhou Liushang, Mo Weijiu, Lin Jinsen, and others, Chiang army soldiers who recently returned from Penghu and Kinmen.

Zhou Liushang said that the Second General Detachment of Chiang Kai-shek's "Anti-Communist National Salvation Army" successively supplemented four batches of overseas Chinese youths from 1952 to 1955. After these youths were added to the Chiang army, they were subjected to strict control through "ideological and behavioral review" and "five-person joint guarantee," and the "Ten Prohibitory Laws." They could not casually write letters to relatives and friends, could not go out alone, and were even forbidden from speaking their native dialect. In addition to various military training every day, they had to undertake heavy physical labor such as repairing fortifications and transporting materials. Many people's bodies became increasingly weak because they could not get enough vegetables and meat in the Chiang army and were often hungry. Some suffered from chronic diseases, and some were bedridden for a long time. Lin Jinsen said that when he went to the "Training Brigade" of the Chiang army's "South China Sea" unit, he saw that twelve or thirteen of the more than 20 overseas Chinese youths there were sick. Because the patients did not receive the necessary treatment, one person later died of illness. These overseas Chinese youths, like other soldiers, were often subjected to insults and beatings.

Lin Jinsen and others said that these overseas Chinese youths were lured from various overseas locations by the Chiang Kai-shek clique with flowery words such as "free advanced studies." Many people realized they had been deceived when they arrived in Taiwan. They were very angry at the Chiang Kai-shek clique's deceptive behavior. An overseas Chinese youth from the Second General Detachment of the Chiang army's "Anti-Communist National Salvation Army" was so angry that he shot through the Chiang Kai-shek clique's flag while on sentry duty. Later, this youth was locked in a gasoline barrel and almost suffocated to death.

    被强迫拉入蒋介石军队的许多华侨青年备受折磨
    据新华社福建前线18日电　被蒋介石集团诱骗到台湾，并强迫拉入蒋介石军队的许多华侨青年，正在蒋军中受着残酷折磨。这是最近从澎湖、金门归来的蒋军士兵周刘赏、莫维就、林金森等对本社记者说的。
    周刘赏说，蒋介石的“反共救国军”第二总队从1952年到1955年先后补进了四批华侨青年。这些青年被补入蒋军以后，受到“思想、言行审查”和“五人连保”、“十大禁律”等的严格管制。他们不能随便向亲友写信，不能单人外出，甚至不准说自己的家乡话。每天除了受各种军事训练以外，要担负修工事、运物资等繁重的体力劳动。许多人由于在蒋军中吃不到足够的蔬菜、肉类和经常挨饿，以致身体都日渐衰弱，有的人害了慢性病，有的长期卧床不起。林金森说，他去蒋军“南海”部队“集训大队”的时候，看到在那里的20多个华侨青年中就有十二、三人生病。由于病人得不到必要的治疗，有一个人后来病死了。这些华侨青年也像其他士兵一样，常常受到凌辱和打骂。
    林金森等说，这些华侨青年是蒋介石集团用“免费升学深造”等花言巧语从海外各地骗来的。许多人到了台湾，才知道上了当。他们对蒋介石集团的欺骗行为十分愤恨。蒋军“反共救国军”第二总队一个华侨青年，气愤得在站岗的时候用枪打穿了蒋介石集团的旗帜。后来，这个青年被关进一只汽油桶里，险些儿闷死。
