    Beijing Nanyuan Agricultural Machine Station Begins Spring Ploughing
    Starting from March 13th, the Beijing Nanyuan Agricultural Machine Station began formulating machine-ploughing contracts with three farms, one collective farm, and 41 agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs of Beijing. According to the results of mutual consultation, the agricultural machine station's machinery will operate on a large area of over 400,000 mu of land, which is more than three and a half times the area worked last year.
    The Nanyuan Agricultural Machine Station completed the maintenance and repair of its machinery before the thaw, and conducted trial plowing in early March. Now, many tractors have already headed to the areas prepared for work, and the official start of spring plowing and spring damming for soil moisture conservation will begin on March 15th.

    北京南苑农业机器站开始春耕
    北京南苑农业机器站在3月13日起开始同北京市郊区的三个农场，1个集体农庄和41个农业生产合作社制定机耕合同。按照双方协商的结果，农业机器站的机具将在40多万亩大面积土地上作业，这个作业面积比去年增加了三倍半以上。
    南苑农业机器站在解冻前就做好了机具的保养、检修工作，并且在3月初进行了试耕。现在许多拖拉机已经开往准备作业的地段，3月15日起正式开始春耕和春季压坝等保墒工作。
