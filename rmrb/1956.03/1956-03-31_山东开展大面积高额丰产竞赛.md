    The Shandong Province held a conference of activists in socialist agricultural construction from March 15th to 23rd. At the meeting, representatives of agricultural construction activists, scientific and technical workers, and responsible cadres from special districts and counties (cities) unanimously responded to the call of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to launch a province-wide "millions and millions of jin" large-scale high-yield production competition.
    Shandong Province aims to produce 30 billion jin of grain this year, an increase of 11.4% over last year, and the output of ginned cotton and peanuts will also increase compared to last year.
