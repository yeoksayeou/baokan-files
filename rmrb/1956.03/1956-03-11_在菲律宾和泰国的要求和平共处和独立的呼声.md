Xinhua News Agency, Manila, March 9th: Filipino Congressman Cunco, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said on March 8 that the Philippines should adopt a policy of peaceful coexistence.

	Cunco said: "It would be foolish for Filipinos to drag the Philippines into a war with China, because such a war is a foolish and costly adventure. Peaceful coexistence is possible and appropriate."

Xinhua News Agency, Manila: Members of the Philippine House of Representatives fiercely criticized the Foreign Investment Bill initiated by Philippine President Magsaysay, which encourages large amounts of American capital to enter the Philippines.

	Representative Tolentino of the House of Representatives said, "It is very dangerous to open our doors wide to foreign capitalists." He said that as long as foreign capitalists stay here, "they will acquire vested rights, and later, they may try to consolidate these rights through diplomatic or political interference."

	Agence France-Presse reported from Manila that "because the House of Representatives is full of anti-American sentiment," Magsaysay's foreign investment bill "appears to have little chance of being passed."

Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok: The semi-monthly "Homeland" demanded in an editorial in its February 25th issue that the Thai government break away from American shackles and implement an independent policy.

	The editorial said that the Thai people are well aware of the reasons for the rising cost of living, on the one hand, because Thai trade is bound by relations established with Western powers, and on the other hand, because the government's spending on war preparation exceeds its capacity.

	The editorial pointed out that the correct way for the Thai government to solve the gradually deteriorating living conditions of the people is to free itself from all kinds of shackles so that Thailand can achieve independence in politics, economics, and military affairs.

	The editorial said, "Now Thailand needs to implement free trade, Thailand needs to be friendly with any country, and Thailand needs a peaceful life. Thailand does not need to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, nor does it want other countries to interfere in its own internal affairs."

    在菲律宾和泰国的要求和平共处和独立的呼声
    新华社9日讯　马尼拉消息：菲律宾众议院外交委员会主席库恩柯3月8日说，菲律宾应该采取和平共处的政策。
    库恩柯说：“菲律宾人如果把菲律宾拖入同中国的战争是愚蠢的，因为这种战争是一种愚蠢的和代价浩大的冒险。和平共处是可能的而且是相宜的。”
    据新华社讯　马尼拉消息：菲律宾众议院议员猛烈抨击菲律宾总统麦格赛赛发起的鼓励美国资本大量进入菲律宾的外国投资法案。
    众议院议员托伦蒂诺说，“对外国资本家大开我们的门户是非常危险的”。他说，只要外国资本家一直呆在这里，“他们就获得这种既得权利，后来，他们也许会设法通过外交或政治上的干涉来巩固这种权利”。
    法新社从马尼拉发出的消息说，“由于众议院充满了反美情绪”，麦格赛赛发起的外国投资法案“获得通过的可能性看来是很小的”。
    据新华社讯　曼谷消息：“祖国”半月刊在2月25日一期的社论中，要求泰国政府摆脱美国的束缚，执行独立自主的政策。
    社论说，泰国人民深知促成他们生活费用日益上涨的原因，一方面是由于泰国贸易受到同西方大国所建立的关系的束缚，另一方面是由于政府用于备战的开支超过它的力量。
    社论指出，泰国政府解决正在逐渐恶化的人民生活状况的正确办法是：把自己从各种束缚中摆脱出来，使泰国在政治、经济和军事等方面获得独立。
    社论说，“现在泰国需要实行自由贸易，泰国需要同任何国家友好，泰国需要和平的生活。泰国不需要去干涉别国的内部事务，同时也不希望别国伸手来干预自己的内部事务。”
