    A Batch of Young Scientific Research Interns Promoted to Assistant Researchers
    Since September of last year, the various institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai and Nanjing have successively promoted 24 research interns to assistant researchers.

    These newly promoted assistant researchers are all young scientific research personnel who have undergone four to five years of scientific research work after graduating from university. They already possess the ability to conduct research in one area under the guidance of senior scientists. Fan Shifan, of the Institute of Physiology and Biochemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who was promoted to assistant researcher, graduated from Jiaotong University in 1950. He has written or co-written four scientific research papers that have been published in domestic academic journals. Fan Shifan is now able to read specialized books in English, Russian, German, and French. Lu Rukun, of the Institute of Soil Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who was promoted to assistant researcher, graduated from the Department of Agricultural Chemistry of Nanjing University in 1950. He has now mastered basic experimental operation techniques and has demonstrated a certain degree of creativity and the ability to organize and summarize work in the course of agricultural chemical research.

    一批青年科学研究实习员被提升为助理研究员
    中国科学院在上海、南京的各研究所，从去年9月以来陆续提升24名研究实习员为助理研究员。
    这批新提升的助理研究员都是在大学毕业后经过四、五年科学研究工作锻炼的青年科学研究人员。他们已具备在老科学家指导下进行一个方面研究工作的能力。中国科学院生理生化研究所被提升为助理研究员的范世藩，1950年在交通大学毕业后，写作或同其他研究人员合写的科学研究论文，先后有4篇已经在国内学术刊物上发表。范世藩现在已经能够阅读英、俄、德、法四国文字的专科书籍。中国科学院土壤研究所的被提升为助理研究员的鲁如坤，是南京大学农业化学系1950年毕业生。他现在已经掌握基本实验操作技术，在进行一项农业化学研究中，表现了有一定的创造性和组织、总结工作的能力。（新华社）
