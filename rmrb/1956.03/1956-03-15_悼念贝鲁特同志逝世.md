Telegram of Condolence from Yugoslav President Tito

Belgrade, 13th (Xinhua News Agency): Yugoslav President Tito, on behalf of the Federal Executive Council of Yugoslavia and in his personal capacity, sent a telegram to Polish Premier Cyrankiewicz, expressing deep condolences on the death of Bolesław Bierut.

The Deep Mourning of the Polish People

The entire Polish people learned with deep sorrow of the death of Bolesław Bierut, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party. In factories, mines, offices, and schools, people stopped working and studying for a few minutes to express their grief over the death of Comrade Bierut. National flags with black crepe were hung on residences and public buildings throughout the country. Shop windows displayed photographs of Bierut draped with black ribbons.

In the city of Lublin—where Bierut spent his youth and engaged in early revolutionary activities—at the truck factory, Jan Jurek, a welder and a long-standing member of the Polish Communist Party, spoke to the workers. He said: "Bierut has always been our role model. He encouraged comrades with his courage, perseverance, and infinite loyalty to our cause. We have lost one of the party's most loyal members. This is a great loss, but we older and more experienced people know: the strength of the party lies in the masses and its members. Learning from Comrade Bierut's example, we will turn the ideals of the Polish United Workers' Party, which he strived to realize throughout his life, into reality."

Statement by the Central Council of Polish Trade Unions

To mourn the death of Bolesław Bierut, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, the Central Council of Polish Trade Unions issued a statement.

The statement said that the Polish working class learned with deep sorrow of the death of Comrade Bolesław Bierut, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party—an unyielding fighter for the cause of the working people.

The unity of the entire trade union movement under the ideological and political leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party constitutes the source of the trade unions' increasingly strengthened role in national life and socialist construction. This unity is inextricably linked to Comrade Bierut's activities, to his struggle to unify the working-class movement on the basis of Marxism-Leninism.

The image of Comrade Bierut will forever remain in our memory as an immortal example of boundless and selfless loyalty to the cause of the working class.

Loyal to the ideas to which he dedicated his life, the trade unions of People's Poland will wage an unremitting struggle, under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, for the victory of the great cause of democracy, peace, and socialism.

The Mourning of the Soviet People

The workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals of the Soviet Union felt deep sorrow upon learning of the unfortunate death of the great son of the Polish people, Bolesław Bierut. The Central Committees of the Communist Parties of the various union republics, the Councils of Ministers, and the Presidiums of the Supreme Soviets have successively sent telegrams of condolence to Poland.

During breaks in the workshops, workers everywhere spoke with heavy hearts about this sad loss. Many people recalled their meetings with Comrade Bierut during their visits to the Polish People's Republic.

Butkevich, foreman of the water turbine workshop at the Leningrad Metal Factory, said to his colleagues, "I, along with other Soviet soldiers, participated in the campaign to liberate Warsaw from the Hitlerite occupiers. I know how much the Polish working people loved Bierut. His glorious image will forever live on in the cause of the people of the Polish People's Republic, in the cause of the working people of all countries." Many factories, collective farms, state farms, and schools in various border regions held memorial meetings for the unfortunate death of Bolesław Bierut.
