    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles's speech on February 24th before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has been met with much criticism and attack within the United States. In his speech, Dulles tried to diminish the significance of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the achievements of the Soviet Union's peaceful diplomatic policy, in order to cover up the failure of the U.S.'s "policy of strength." Disregarding the facts, he insisted that the Soviet Communist Party Congress showed that, due to the West's implementation of a "policy of strength," the Soviet Union had "failed" and was "revising" its policies.

    Democratic Senator Fulbright said: No one in the United States agrees with Dulles's opinion on the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He pointed out that some qualified political observers in Washington believe that Khrushchev's report at the Congress reflected the Soviet Union's confidence in its own strength. Fulbright said: "Regardless of what Dulles says, we are now being defeated." "We are in a very dangerous situation." He said that Dulles's explanation of the current situation was "completely inconsistent" with the facts as he understood them.

    On February 27th, Fulbright again accused Dulles of "deceiving public opinion." He said that Dulles's attempt to prove that "the Soviet Union's victory is actually a defeat, and the West's defeat is actually a victory" showed an irresponsible attitude. Fulbright said: "Is the sight of millions of people in India and Burma cheering Soviet leaders an expression of the Soviet policy's tragic failure? I think not. Is Russia's entry into the once-forbidden Middle East in a surprising and powerful manner an expression of the Kremlin being thwarted? No. Does the crumbling Baghdad Pact prove that everything is going smoothly for the West in that region of the world? I think not. Are the cracks in the Western alliance's European stronghold a reason to praise the recent policies adopted by American diplomacy? I think not."

    Fulbright asked Dulles to tell the American people the "truth" about diplomacy, and "not treat us like children who will happily clap their hands at any fairy tale."

    Several Democratic senators agreed with Fulbright's views. Senator Morse said: "I am sure that if the American people do not stop Dulles, if we do not fight against the philosophy he expressed at last Friday's (February 24th) hearing, then he will lead us over the brink." (He was referring to Dulles's talk of being on the "edge of war.")

    Democratic elder statesman and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sparkman, said that he "found it hard to believe" Dulles's claim that the Soviet Union was changing its policies because it was "afraid of us (the United States)." He said: The Soviet Union is surpassing us in some aspects of weapons.

    New York Governor and Democratic presidential nomination contender Harriman accused Dulles's speech of "dangerously distorting the facts." He said: The facts are just the opposite. The Soviet Union has reaffirmed and strengthened its policies, which have achieved considerable success throughout Asia and the Middle East.

    James Reston, the "New York Times" correspondent in Washington, said in a commentary on February 26th that the committee members attending the meeting were "very surprised" by Dulles's speech. Other ambassadors of American allies sitting in the conference room were also "stunned." Reston also said, "No one here (Washington) really believes this, and even Dulles himself doesn't believe it." Reston went on to say: Dulles has contracted an increasingly disturbing habit in Washington: "Giving one impression in public and another in private."

    杜勒斯诬蔑苏联和平外交政策的发言受到抨击
    据新华社讯  美国国务卿杜勒斯2月24日在参议院外交委员会上的发言受到美国国内很多的批评和抨击。杜勒斯在发言里力图缩小苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的意义和苏联和平外交政策的成就，来掩饰美国“实力政策”的失败。他不顾事实地硬说，苏联共产党代表大会表明，由于西方执行“实力政策”，苏联已经“失败了”，并且正在“修改”它的政策。
    民主党参议员福尔布莱特说：美国没有一个人同意杜勒斯对苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的意见。他指出：华盛顿一些有资格的政治观察家认为，赫鲁晓夫在大会上的报告反映了苏联对自己力量的信心。福尔布莱特说：“不管杜勒斯怎样说，我们现在就在遭到失败。”“我们处于非常危险的境地。”他说，杜勒斯对目前局势的解释同他所了解的事实是“完全不符合的”。
    福尔布莱特2月27日再次指责杜勒斯“欺骗舆论”。他说，杜勒斯企图证明“苏联的胜利实际上是失败，而西方的失败实际上是胜利”，这表现了不负责任的态度。福尔布莱特说：“印度和缅甸的千百万人民向苏联领导人欢呼的景象是苏联政策的悲惨的失败的表现吗？我想不是。俄国以惊人和有力的姿态进入一度是禁区的中东是克里姆林宫受锉折的表现吗？不是的。摇摇欲坠的巴格达条约组织是否证明：西方在世界那个地区的事业一切都顺利？我想不是。西方联盟的西欧大本营中的裂痕难道是应该赞扬美国外交最近采取的方针的一个理由吗？我想不是。”
    福尔布莱特要求杜勒斯把外交“真相”告诉给美国人，而“不要把我们当作对任何童话都会高兴拍手的小孩看待”。
    好些民主党参议员赞成福尔布莱特的见解。参议员莫尔斯说：“我确信，如果美国人民不制止杜勒斯，如果我们不同他在上星期五（2月24日）的意见听取会上所表示的那种哲学作斗争，那他将会把我们引出边缘。”（他是指杜勒斯所说的“战争边缘”）
    民主党元老、参议院外交委员会委员斯巴克曼说，他“很难相信”杜勒斯的所谓苏联由于“害怕我们（美国）”而正在改变它的政策的说法。他说：苏联在武器的某些方面正在超过我们。
    纽约州州长、民主党总统候选人提名竞争者之一哈里曼指责杜勒斯的发言“危险地歪曲了事实”。他说：事实正相反，苏联重新肯定和加强了它的政策，这种政策在整个亚洲和中东取得了十分可观的成功。
    “纽约时报”驻华盛顿记者赖斯顿在2月26日的一篇评论里说，参加会议的委员们对杜勒斯的发言“感到非常惊讶”。另外一些坐在会议室里的代表着美国友邦的大使们也“目瞪口呆”了。赖斯顿又说，“这里（华盛顿）谁也不会真相信这一套，就是杜勒斯本人也不会相信。”赖斯顿接着说：杜勒斯已经沾染上了华盛顿的一种越来越令人不安的习气：“在公开的时候给人一种印象，而私下又给人另一种印象。”
