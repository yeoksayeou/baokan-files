    New Creation by Carpenter Huang Rongchang
    Labor model Huang Rongchang's recently designed and manufactured first large-scale stone sawing machine in China has been largely installed. This is the 57th machine created by Huang Rongchang and the workers in the woodworking workshop of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company in recent years. This stone sawing machine can saw rocks from the mountains into smooth and flat strips or stone bricks, providing a large supply for basic construction needs. Its working efficiency is dozens of times higher than manual quarrying, and the quality is also very good. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    木工黄荣昌新的创造
    劳动模范黄荣昌最近设计制造的我国第一部大型锯石机，已经大体安装完毕。这是黄荣昌和他所在的重庆钢铁公司木工房工人们几年来创造的第57部机器。这种锯石机能把山上的岩石锯成平整光滑的条石或石砖，大量供应基本建设的需用，工作效率要比人工开凿石料提高几十倍，质量也很好。（据新华社讯）
