Halt the Fascist Attacks of the American Reactionaries

On March 27th, the American government, on the pretext of tax arrears, sealed up the national headquarters of the American Communist Party in New York, as well as the district offices in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Chicago, Detroit, and Newark, and the "Daily Worker" newspaper office in New York, edited by the American Communist Party, and its offices in Chicago and Detroit. At the same time, the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Emanuel Blum, a senior cadre of the Communist Party, in Chicago. This is a planned nationwide persecution of the American Communist Party by the American government and a preliminary step in preparing to further declare the American Communist Party illegal. All progressive people cannot help but feel indignant at this McCarthy-style persecution of the American Communist Party by the American government.

The American government's intensified persecution of the American Communist Party is a signal of a fascist attack on all democratic forces in the United States, especially the working class and their organizations. This strike is also aimed at all those who oppose the arms race and advocate peaceful coexistence. The current international situation is greatly favorable to the cause of peace and democracy. The people of all countries, including the American people, are waging effective struggles to win a solid peace and advance the cause of democracy. The American Communist Party, in safeguarding the cause of world peace and democracy, and at the same time safeguarding the interests of the American people, has always stood with the American people, uniting all progressive forces, and playing a vanguard role. This has violated the interests of the American reactionaries, whose interests are linked to the "Cold War" and "arms race" policies. This is why the American reactionaries have been painstakingly trying to intensify the persecution of the American Communist Party. This move by the American government once again exposes to the world that they are hostile to peace.

The American reactionaries hope to use terror and intimidation to save their increasingly bankrupt "position of strength" policy and force the masses to submit to war policies and fascism, and they closed down the "Daily Worker" on the pretext of tax arrears. Because the "Daily Worker" has been breaking through the atmosphere of hysteria that fills the United States and issuing clear calls, expressing the American people's aspirations for peace, democracy, and progress, it has become a thorn in the side of war planners and fascists. The propaganda of the American bourgeoisie once boasted that the continued existence of the "Daily Worker" proved that the United States had political freedom. Now, even the last remaining bit of bourgeois "democracy" and "freedom" is seen as dangerous by the American reactionaries and must be destroyed. As the American Communist Party pointed out in its protest to the American government: this is a violation of all principles of freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of assembly and association, and a direct violation of the American Constitution. This typical example shows how hypocritical the American reactionaries are in talking about American "democracy" and "freedom," and to what extent the American reactionaries fear progressive things. Obviously, the American reactionaries' final adoption of such shameful persecution action is a reflection of their weakness and increasingly unstable rule.

The whole world is advancing on the road of peace and human progress, and the United States cannot go against the tide of the times. The American reactionaries' attempt to stop the American people's struggle against war, for peace and democracy, and for improving their lives through this fascist action is futile. Progressive people all over the world, like the American Communists, are convinced that the American working class will carry forward the tradition of struggle, stop the fascist persecution of the American people by the American reactionaries, and stop its huge conspiracy against peace and democracy. All American people who are fighting for peace and democracy, in order to defend the democratic traditions of the United States and to defend the interests of the American people, will actively participate in this battle. The just struggle can and will be victorious.

    制止美国反动派的法西斯进攻
    美国政府在三月二十七日借口欠税，查封了在纽约的美国共产党全国总部和在旧金山、洛杉矶、费城、芝加哥、底特律和纽瓦克的分区办事处，以及美国共产党主编的纽约“工人日报”的报社和它在芝加哥、底特律的办事处。同时在芝加哥联邦调查局逮捕了共产党的高级干部伊曼纽尔·布鲁姆。这是美国政府在全国范围内有计划进行的对美国共产党的迫害行动，也是准备进一步宣布美国共产党非法的先行步骤。对于美国政府这种麦卡锡式的迫害美国共产党的行动，所有进步人士不能不感到愤慨。
    美国政府加紧对美国共产党的迫害，是对美国所有民主力量、首先是工人阶级和他们的组织发动法西斯进攻的信号，这种打击也是针对所有反对扩军备战、主张和平共处的人们的。现在国际形势已大大有利于和平民主的事业。世界各国人民，包括美国人民在内，正在为争取稳固的和平和推进民主的事业而进行有效的斗争。美国共产党在维护世界和平和民主的事业、同时也是维护美国人民利益的斗争中，一直和美国人民一道，团结一切进步力量，起着先锋的作用。这就触犯了美国反动派的利益，他们的利益是和“冷战”、“军备竞赛”政策连系在一起的。这就是美国反动派为什么处心积虑地设法加紧迫害美国共产党的缘故。美国政府这一举动，再一次向全世界暴露了他们是敌视和平的。
    美国反动派指望以恐怖和威吓的办法来挽救它日益破产的“实力地位”政策，并强迫人民群众向战争政策和法西斯主义屈服，就借口欠税封闭了“工人日报”。因为“工人日报”一直冲破充塞着美国全国的歇斯底里气氛而发出清醒的呼声，表达出美国人民对于和平、民主、进步的热望，因此成了战争策划者和法西斯主义者的眼中钉。美国资产阶级的宣传曾吹嘘说，“工人日报”的继续存在就证明美国有政治自由，而现在，连最后残存的一点点资产阶级“民主”、“自由”在美国反动派看来也是危险的，而必须设法加以摧毁了。正如美国共产党向美国政府的抗议中指出的：这是对言论自由、出版自由和集会结社自由等所有原则的侵犯，也是直接违背美国的宪法的。这个典型例子说明，高谈美国“民主”、“自由”的美国反动派是多么的虚伪，说明美国反动派惧怕进步事物达到了何等的程度。显然，美国反动派终于采取这种可耻的迫害行动，正是它的脆弱和统治日益不稳的反映。
    整个世界正在和平和人类进步的道路上迈进，美国也不可能违背时代的潮流。美国反动派企图通过这种法西斯的行动，制止美国人民反对战争、争取和平民主和改善生活的斗争，是徒然的。全世界进步人士和美国共产党人一样，确信美国工人阶级将发扬战斗的传统，制止美国反动派对美国人民的法西斯迫害，制止它的反和平民主的巨大阴谋。一切为和平和民主奋斗的美国人民，为了保卫美国的民主传统，为了保卫美国人民的利益，必将积极地参加到这一战斗的行列中来。正义的斗争能够而且一定会取得胜利的。
