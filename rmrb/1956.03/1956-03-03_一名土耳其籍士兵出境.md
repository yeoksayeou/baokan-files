Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 2nd: Former UN Turkish soldier, Necaati Öztürk, was handed over to Süleyman Yandel, Chief of the Second Section of the Turkish Brigade Staff of the UN Forces, at Shenzhen by Zhang Hanxiu, a staff member of the Chinese Red Cross, at 13:00 Beijing time on March 1st, to be taken to Hong Kong en route to his home country.

Necaati and another Turkish soldier, Selahattin Akça, crossed the Korean Military Demarcation Line on February 28, 1955, and entered the military control zone of the Korean-Chinese side, requesting to live in China. After the Chinese Red Cross, according to their wishes, applied to the Chinese authorities for approval on their behalf, they came to China and worked in the Jinan Paper Mill in Shandong. On November 9, 1955, the Turkish government, through the Turkish envoy to Switzerland, expressed to our Ambassador Wang Bingnan their hope to assist them in returning to Turkey. After the Chinese government informed Necaati and Selahattin of the Turkish government's opinion, Necaati expressed his willingness to return home. The Chinese Red Cross then sent someone to accompany him and handed him over to the people sent by the Turkish government in Shenzhen.

    新华社广州2日电　前联合国军土耳其籍士兵乃加梯·欧斯土鲁已经在3月1日北京时间十三时，在深圳由中国红十字会工作人员张汉修将他交给联合国军土耳其旅参谋军官第二科科长苏里亚扬德尔带往香港首途回国。
    乃加梯是在1955年2月28日和另一名土耳其籍士兵沙拉哈丁·阿克洽一起越过朝鲜军事分界线，进入朝中方面军事控制区，并且请求来中国居住，当经中国红十字会根据他们的愿望，代向中国主管当局申请获得批准，来到中国，在山东济南造纸厂工作。1955年11月9日，土耳其政府通过土耳其驻瑞士使节向我国王炳南大使表示，希望协助他们返回土耳其。中国政府将土耳其政府的意见通知了乃加梯和沙拉哈丁以后，乃加梯表示愿意回国，即由中国红十字会派人陪送，在深圳交由土耳其政府派来的人领回。
