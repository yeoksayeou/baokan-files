    Longfeng Mine Integrates Various Advanced Experiences
    Creates New Coal Mining Methods Suitable for the Mine's Conditions
    (Our Dispatch) Fushun Longfeng Coal Mine, by integrating the advanced coal mining methods of Pang Guanxiang and Zhou Guangrui, as well as the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union, brother mines, and its own mine, has created four new coal mining methods suitable for various conditions in the mine. Among these four coal mining methods, there is a three-extraction and one-filling method suitable for four shifts a day under better natural conditions; a four-extraction and two-filling method suitable for simultaneous operation on two working faces with thick coal seams and many rock partings; and a two-extraction and two-filling method suitable for poor natural conditions.
    After these coal mining methods were tested and implemented on four working faces, the daily output of one section increased from 500 tons to about 1,400 tons, and the efficiency of each mining worker increased from 4 tons to about 11 tons. These four coal mining methods will be implemented throughout the mine in the second quarter. It is estimated that the average daily output of each section can reach about 1,200 to 1,300 tons, and the average daily output of each mining worker can reach 12 tons. Costs will also be greatly reduced.

    龙凤矿综合各种先进经验
    创造适合本矿情况的新采煤法
    本报讯　抚顺龙凤煤矿综合庞观祥、周广瑞的先进采煤方法和苏联、兄弟矿、本矿的先进经验，创造了四种适合本矿各种情况的新采煤方法。这四种采煤方法中有适于自然条件较好的一天四班作业的三采一充的采煤方法，有适合作厚煤层夹石多的两个掌子面同时作业的四采二充的采煤方法，有适合于自然条件较差的两采两充的采煤方法。
    这些采煤方法在四个掌子面上试验推行以后，一个段的日产量由过去的500吨提高到1，400吨左右，每个回采工效率由过去的4吨提高到11吨左右。这四种采煤方法第二季度将在全矿推行。预计每个段的日产量可以平均达到1，200到1，300吨左右，每个回采工平均日产量可以达到12吨。成本也将大为降低。
