To the Editor:

The Jinan Municipal Bureau of Heavy Industry plans to produce 32,000 waterwheels in the first quarter of 1956. On December 15, 1955, they comprehensively assigned this task to 51 machinery and iron factories throughout the city, stipulating that the bureau would uniformly supply drawings, models, and samples, requiring all factories to complete all preparatory work before the end of December and produce 1,000 to 2,000 waterwheel parts as a regular production reserve. However, although the Bureau of Heavy Industry verbally proclaimed the importance of waterwheel production, it did not adopt a positive and responsible attitude in its actual work. They required factories to start mass production of waterwheels on January 1, 1956, but by early January, they had only prepared raw materials for 2,000 waterwheels, and it was not until after January 20 that the raw materials were generally sufficient. After the raw materials were available, it was discovered that there were problems with the tools and models. For example, they entrusted the Wende Iron Factory to make 13 sets of samples, but lacked specific inspection during the manufacturing process, so it was not until the delivery on January 10 that 9 of them were found to be defective. They entrusted the Qingfaxiang Sand Casting Factory to manufacture iron mold bases, but because they did not closely supervise them, these molds were not delivered to the waterwheel manufacturing factories until February 7. As a result, until February 5, these 51 machinery and iron factories had not produced a single waterwheel.

The 51 factories entrusted by the Jinan Municipal Bureau of Heavy Industry to produce waterwheels planned to invest 759 workers, 94 machines, and 18 cupola furnaces in waterwheel production, but in January, these factories were in a state of shutdown and semi-shutdown. This made the operation of some factories difficult and also affected the lives of the workers. Farmers in Shandong Province have dug more than 470,000 wells from last winter to now, but the production of waterwheels is far behind, which is a serious problem.

I believe that the Jinan Municipal Bureau of Heavy Industry should seriously examine and correct the shortcomings in its past work and quickly change the backward state of waterwheel production.

    应当改变水车生产的落后状态编辑同志：
    济南市重工业管理局计划在1956年第一季度生产32，000部水车。他们在1955年12月15日就向全市51家机器铁工厂全面布置了这项任务，规定由局里统一供应图纸、模型和样板等，要求各厂在12月底以前作好一切准备工作，并且生产出1，000到2，000部的水车零件，作为经常生产的储备量。但是，重工业管理局虽然在口头上也高嚷生产水车的任务如何重要，而在实际工作中并没有采取积极负责的态度。他们要求各工厂在1956年1月1日开始大量生产水车，但是到1月上旬只准备了2，000部水车的原料，一直到1月20日以后原料才大体上够用。有了原料以后，又发现工具、模型又有了问题。例如，他们委托文德铁工厂做了13套样板，而在制造过程中缺乏具体的检查，因此直到1月10日交货的时候才发现其中有9套是废品。他们委托庆发祥翻砂厂制造铁托模子，因为没有抓紧督促，这些模子一直到2月7日才送到制造水车的工厂使用。这样，一直到2月5日，这51家机器铁工厂没有生产出一部水车来。
    济南市重工业管理局委托生产水车的51个工厂，预计投入水车生产的工人759名，机器94台，化铁炉18个，但是在1月份这些工厂都处在停工和半停工的状态。这就使有些工厂的经营发生了困难，而且也影响了工人的生活。山东省的农民从去年冬天到现在已经打井47万多眼，可是水车的生产却远远落在后面，这是一个严重的问题。
    我认为，济南市重工业管理局应该认真检查和纠正过去工作中的缺点，迅速改变水车生产中的落后状态。
