As the work of eliminating illiteracy is actively carried out, the number of peasants enrolled in schools nationwide has reached 62 million, accounting for more than 30% of the young and middle-aged illiterate peasants in the country; the number of workers enrolled in schools nationwide is approximately 3 million.

The work of eliminating illiteracy has already formed a high tide in some areas. In Shanxi Province, the number of peasants enrolled in schools has reached 58% of the number of young and middle-aged illiterates; in Anhui and Shandong provinces, it has reached more than 40%. In the suburbs of Beijing and other minority areas, it has reached more than 80% to 90%. In Jiangsu Province, 50% of the illiterate workers have enrolled in schools; all illiterate workers at the Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company have enrolled in schools. Beijing is preparing to organize all illiterate workers to enroll in schools in March this year. The enthusiasm for learning among the broad masses of workers and peasants is very high. In the past, it was thought that women with many children had difficulty learning, but now many of them have participated in learning. Some elderly people in their 50s and 60s have also participated in learning.

All localities have adopted active measures for the work of eliminating illiteracy and have generally made plans. Many places have planned from top to bottom all the way down to factories, agricultural cooperatives, and streets. Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, and other 16 provinces and cities have successively held professional meetings on the work of eliminating illiteracy. Beijing, Shanghai, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and other provinces and cities have established associations for eliminating illiteracy; some counties and townships have also established associations for eliminating illiteracy or work teams for eliminating illiteracy. Shandong Province alone has mobilized 1.2 million literate people in rural areas to participate in the work of eliminating illiteracy.

    全国6，500万工农文盲入学
    随着扫除文盲工作的积极开展，全国农民入学的已达6，200万人，占全国农民青、壮年文盲30％以上；全国职工入学的约计300万人。
    扫除文盲工作，目前部分地区已经形成高潮。山西省入学农民达青、壮年文盲人数58％；安徽、山东两省达40％以上。北京市郊区和其他少数地区达80％到90％以上。江苏省职工已有50％的文盲入学；北京石景山钢铁公司职工文盲全部入学。北京市准备今年3月间组织全部职工文盲入学。广大工人、农民的学习情绪很高。过去认为孩子多的妇女学习有困难，现在很多人都参加了学习。50岁、60岁的老年人有的也参加了学习。
    各地对扫除文盲工作都采取积极的措施，普遍作了规划。不少地方自上而下地一直规划到工厂、农业合作社、街道。北京、天津、河北、山东等16个省市先后召开了扫除文盲工作的专业会议。北京、上海、山西、江苏、内蒙古自治区等省市成立了扫除文盲协会；部分县、乡也成立了扫除文盲协会或扫除文盲工作队。仅山东一省就动员了120万农村识字的人参加扫除文盲工作。
