Speech at the Commemorative Meeting of Women from All Walks of Life in the Capital on "March 8th" International Women's Day
Zhang Yun, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation

Dear sisters! Dear friends!

Today, we gather together with sisters from all walks of life in the capital, the wives of foreign envoys, the female experts and expert wives from the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries who are selflessly helping with our country's construction, and international friends who are visiting our country, to solemnly commemorate our own festival – "March 8th" International Women's Day. I feel honored and happy from the bottom of my heart!

The past year was an extraordinary year. Internationally, the sincere friendship and brotherly cooperation between socialist countries led by the Soviet Union have been increasingly consolidated and strengthened. The famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by India and China have been more and more widely welcomed and supported among people from countries with different social systems. The anti-colonialist people's movement has risen to an unprecedented height, and the forces of peace have continued to grow and strengthen, making the tense international situation, which contained enormous dangers, tend to ease. Domestically, a nationwide socialist upsurge has emerged. Following the upsurge of agricultural cooperation involving hundreds of millions of peasants across the country, the cooperation of handicrafts and the joint state-private ownership of the entire capitalist industry and commerce followed into a high tide. The entire national economy and cultural undertakings also followed and embarked on a high tide. This year, women of all nationalities and all strata across the country, female workers, female farmers, female intellectuals, and the vast number of housewives have spent it in the thriving atmosphere of the motherland, making outstanding contributions to the socialist construction and socialist transformation of the motherland, and achieving excellent results. Therefore, when I commemorate this year's "March 8th" International Women's Day with everyone, I am as happy and energetic as everyone else!

Today, on the day when we women review our own strength, I would first like to report to you: the progress and changes that Chinese women have shown in building a socialist motherland this year.

In the past year, the socialist consciousness and labor enthusiasm of women across the country have been unprecedentedly high, the enthusiasm for learning and improving culture has become greater and greater; life has been further improved, and the family and social status have been significantly improved.

On the industrial production front, female workers have enthusiastically devoted themselves to the upsurge of socialist labor competition. They consciously put forward plans to increase production and quality, as well as guarantees for the implementation of the plans. They take striving to become activists in socialist construction as an honor, and they have a strong desire to create new records. Therefore, good news of breaking quotas and creating new records continues to come from factories and mining enterprises all over the country. After Beijing State-owned Cotton No. 1 and No. 2 factories in the capital proposed an inter-factory competition to improve product quality, strictly practice comprehensive economy, and improve productivity to cotton textile factories across the country, it was enthusiastically responded to by cotton textile factories across the country. In this competition, Pu Yuzhen, a female worker at Shanghai State-owned Cotton No. 17 Factory, created a new record of reducing the leather roller flower rate to 0.064% in January this year, which was half less than the national prescribed target; then Wang Xiulan, a female worker at Shanghai State-owned Cotton No. 1 Factory, created a new record of reducing the leather roller flower rate to 0.04% in February this year. It has become a common fact that female workers complete production plans evenly on an annual and monthly basis. A female worker group in the anchor chain workshop of the steel casting workshop of Dalian Shipyard completed the first Five-Year Plan one year and eleven and a half months ahead of schedule on January 14. In order to overfulfill the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, female workers are increasingly using their brains and putting forward rationalization proposals as masters. In order to better master modern technology, many female workers enthusiastically participated in cultural and technical studies. Factories and mining enterprises in various places have formulated plans to eliminate illiteracy within one or two years. Cities such as Shanghai and Tianjin have decided to organize all illiterate workers, including illiterate female workers, to enroll in school this year.

On the agricultural production front, thanks to Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the successive publication and promulgation of the "Model Regulations for Agricultural Production Cooperatives" (draft) and the "National Agricultural Development Program" (draft), the enthusiasm of farmers to take the socialist road has been greatly supported and encouraged. The broad masses of women are equally enthusiastic, rushing to join agricultural production cooperatives and actively engaging in agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery production. They said: "Birds rely on trees, fish rely on water, and women can only thoroughly liberate themselves by relying on cooperatives." Female members are full of energy and enthusiasm. They have made more and greater achievements than in previous years in various productions such as autumn harvest, fertilizer accumulation, pig raising, pest control, water conservancy construction, cotton field management, and wheat management. They work together with all farmers to strive for a bumper harvest in 1956. In order to better improve production, a large number of women are advancing towards culture and technology. Many women who were originally illiterate can now read books and newspapers, and many girls who have never seen machines have now become excellent tractor drivers. Many women have learned to master new agricultural tools. There are already more than 2,540 female technicians in the national agricultural water conservancy system. Due to the achievements women have shown in production, women have been publicly recognized by society as an indispensable force in agricultural production. Many women have become the leading backbone of agricultural production cooperatives. A year ago, there were not many women who served as directors or deputy directors of agricultural production cooperatives, but now the vast majority of agricultural production cooperatives have at least one female deputy director. In production teams, almost every team has a female captain or deputy captain. The social status of women has been greatly improved. At the same time, due to the change in production relations, the subordinate position of rural women in family relations has also disappeared. Women and men have become equal members in the face of work points. Democratic and harmonious families have emerged universally and in large numbers. This new family relationship, in turn, has promoted the high tide of labor enthusiasm among male and female farmers.

Female intellectuals across the country, in the high tide of the socialist revolution, love their motherland and careers even more, and unite more closely with workers and peasants, contributing their strength to various aspects of science, culture, art, and education with creative labor. With the grand aspiration of catching up with the world's advanced scientific level, they are tirelessly working to improve science and technology and to improve the cultural level of the working people. The 4 million female members of handicraft cooperatives across the country are enthusiastically producing various products in the high tide of socialist transformation of handicrafts. Female staff members of government agencies and people's organizations across the country are also working hard with all state staff members to accelerate socialist construction. The vast number of family members and housewives of workers and staff members have shown new achievements in doing a good job in housework, helping workers and staff members do a good job in production and work, and participating in cultural learning. The "Five Goods" movement of good family neighborhood unity and mutual assistance, good family life arrangements, good education of children, encouragement of relatives in production, work, and study, and good self-learning has been widely launched among the families of workers and staff members. They have become a huge force assisting government agencies, factories, and mines in doing a good job in work and production, and carrying out social, cultural, and health movements. It should also be pointed out here that in the past year, the family members of capitalist industrialists and businessmen have also rapidly improved their socialist consciousness. They are earnestly conducting self-study and self-transformation. From learning, from visiting workers' labor, and from the practice of enterprise transformation, they have realized the value of labor and the glory of labor. In the process of implementing joint state-private ownership, many progressive family members of industrialists and businessmen have played a positive role in encouraging relatives and friends to accept socialist transformation. The improvement of the consciousness of the family members of industrialists and businessmen shows the widespread and profound influence of socialist ideology among women of all strata across the country, and also shows the great victory of socialist ideology in the country.

In general: The outstanding and remarkable changes shown by women across the country this year are a consistent and unwavering will to build a socialist motherland and the active actions generated under this iron will.

Dear sisters, what is it that has such great power to make us, the whole country, with one mind, so yearn for socialism? We will all answer in unison: Historical practice has educated us, and the superiority of socialism has enlightened us. That's right. Chinese women, like people of all countries, have seen clearly the fundamental difference between two systems – the socialist system and the capitalist system – from years of personal experience. We have understood right and wrong from this, and understood truth and non-truth. We understand that the socialist system is fundamentally different from the system in which one country enslaves and plunders another. Socialist countries have always supported the national liberation struggles of oppressed nations and are resolutely opposed to any form of colonialism. During the most difficult years when we Chinese people were enslaved and plundered by imperialism, leading to poverty, cultural regression, and unbearable suffering, and had to rise up to carry out national liberation struggles, who sympathized with us, helped us, and supported us the most? It was the socialist Soviet Union. After we Chinese people won the victory of the people's democratic revolution, who was selflessly helping our country with its construction? It was also the socialist Soviet Union and the various countries that are building socialism. They selflessly and fraternally helped us carry out industrial construction and realize industrialization, making our country economically independent, thereby continuously improving the material and cultural life of the people. Therefore, it makes us understand that only on the basis of socialist ideology can sincere and selfless internationalism be produced, can the suffering of others be regarded as one's own suffering, and can the national liberation cause of other countries be regarded as one's own cause, caring about the happiness of the people of one's own country, and also caring about the happiness of the people of other countries. What about the imperialist aggression group? On the contrary, they have always treated the Chinese people with a ferocious face. Before our liberation, they regarded our country as their supply base for cheap labor and cheap raw materials and their sales market for manufactured goods, holding the Chinese people by the throat and controlling the economic lifeline in their hands. The Chinese people were exploited and enslaved in this way, becoming poorer and poorer every day. After we Chinese people broke free from the enslavement and plunder of imperialism, American imperialism has not given up to this day, and still wants to make a comeback and turn China into its colony. For this purpose, they also occupy our territory of Taiwan, establish many military bases surrounding China, and shamelessly carry out various sabotage and subversion activities. Obviously, which system is the gospel of human beings in the world, and which system is the threat and scourge of human beings in the world is very clear in our eyes. It is natural for the Chinese people and Chinese women to choose the socialist system and resolutely take the socialist road.

Also, in the short three years of carrying out socialist construction and socialist transformation, we have already made us very clearly see the superiority of socialism. Due to the change in production relations and the continuous growth of socialist factors, productive forces have gained corresponding continuous development. It is obvious that our industrial construction is developing rapidly in a planned way. Industrial bases are emerging one after another. Newly built factories and mines are increasingly put into production. In the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, the superiority of socialism is also very obvious. Everyone has seen that the low-level forms of state capitalism, such as processing and ordering goods, unified purchase and distribution, and agency purchase and sales, have made great progress in improving production than capitalism, while the high-level form of state capitalism, which implements fixed interest under joint state-private ownership, is more effective in improving production than the low-level forms of state capitalism. The results shown by agricultural socialist transformation are the same. The broad masses of farmers have personally experienced that the semi-socialist agricultural production cooperatives have made great progress in improving production than the individual agricultural economy, while the socialist advanced agricultural production cooperatives are more outstanding in improving production than the semi-socialist primary agricultural production cooperatives. Although our country's construction of socialism has just begun, because the purpose of socialist production is to continuously improve the material and cultural life of the people, the material and cultural life of us Chinese people has been greatly improved with the development of socialist construction. This fact not only makes people see the performance of socialist superiority today, but also makes people full of confidence in the beautiful and happy prospect of the socialist motherland. This is also the most realistic reason why the people of the whole country love the socialist system and wholeheartedly resolutely take the socialist road. Socialism is so closely related to the people's lives and welfare, it is such a beautiful road to common prosperity for all the people, it is natural for the Chinese people, including Chinese women, to like it and support it.

Since our country's liberation, what Chinese women have felt the deepest and realized the most is the real women's liberation embodied in the process of implementing socialist construction and socialist transformation. Now I will use the words of the female farmers themselves to express their experiences! They said: "Before running the cooperative, we suffered from three aspects: suffering from the husband, suffering from the mother-in-law, and suffering from the use of money. After running the cooperative, we got three aspects of benefits: getting work points is the first good, being the master of the house is the second good, and having the right to speak is the third good." Indeed, rural women have the most profound understanding of the truth that the socialist road is the road to the thorough liberation of women. Rural women were the most oppressed in the past, and they had no rights. Since liberation, their rights and social status have gradually improved. What about now? The more advanced agricultural cooperatives are built, the more the socialist principle of paying according to labor and more pay for more work is implemented, and the more the advanced agricultural production cooperatives greatly liberate productive forces and open up broad avenues for the development of agricultural and sideline production, which not only makes it possible for the broad masses of women to participate in production labor but also becomes an urgent need. Therefore, the value of women's labor is manifested, women get paid according to their labor, and show women's independent economic status. In the face of such a fact, true equality between men and women is realized. Let us think about how women should love socialism! Taking the family members of capitalist industrialists and businessmen as an example, although their lives are affluent, they are also discriminated against in class society, and there is no talk of family and social status. Now, they also understand that implementing socialism is not to make people poor, but to continuously develop production in common labor without exploitation, to move towards affluence together, and to live a constantly improving affluent life. As long as they give up exploitation and accept transformation, the affluent and happy socialist life also belongs to them. In the face of these living facts, it is also natural for women of all strata in China, including the family members of capitalist industrialists and businessmen, to unanimously yearn for socialism and participate in socialist construction with infinite enthusiasm.

Dear sisters! The infinite loyalty and enthusiasm shown by us women in building a socialist motherland are very precious. This loyalty and enthusiasm are not only needed to ensure the completion of a socialist motherland, but it must also be understood that the better and faster our country is built, the more it will enhance the strength to defend Asian and world peace. What we are doing now is not only beneficial to ourselves, but also beneficial to future generations and to world peace. Chairman Mao said: "We are doing an extremely glorious and great cause that our predecessors have never done before." If we do this cause well, our descendants will be grateful to us, and peace-loving people all over the world will love us. Therefore, we hope that women across the country will further and greater play this loyalty to socialism and the enthusiasm for building socialism, and in this extraordinary and surging tide of socialist revolution, temper themselves to be stronger, braver, and more capable. We must strive to be activists and model figures in socialist construction in various work positions. Female workers across the country must intensify their efforts to strive to complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it; female farmers across the country must intensify their efforts to realize the forty articles of the National Agricultural Development Program and strive for a greater bumper harvest in 1956; female intellectuals across the country must intensify their efforts to catch up with the world's advanced scientific level; female members of handicraft cooperatives across the country must strive to produce more and better products to meet the needs of the masses; family members of industrialists and businessmen across the country must work harder to further help and encourage relatives to do a good job in enterprises, improve business management, and improve production. Dear sisters, the annual "March 8th" Festival is the day when we review our progress and achievements. Let us dedicate our rapid progress and create more and better achievements to our great motherland and to all peace-loving women sisters all over the world!

Dear sisters!

Just as our people across the country are confidently heading towards socialism, and just as our sisters across the country are jubilantly commemorating their own festivals, we cannot but think of the sisters in Taiwan and the entire people of Taiwan who are still living a dark life under foreign armed rule. Here, we express our heartfelt concern to them! Because the United States used force to occupy Taiwan, interfered in China's internal affairs, and hindered the early liberation of Taiwan. But the Chinese people are bound to liberate Taiwan. Chairman Zhou Enlai of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consult Consultative Conference pointed out at the Second Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People' Political Consultative Conference that at present, the common patriotic responsibility of all our Chinese people, including the people on the mainland and the people of Taiwan, is, in addition to actively preparing to liberate Taiwan by war when necessary, also to strive to liberate Taiwan by peaceful means. We believe that the Taiwanese sisters and all Taiwanese compatriots with patriotic spirit will certainly not be willing to endure living a life of being insulted and enslaved under foreign rule for a long time, and will certainly be able to bravely stand up and work together with the sisters of the motherland and the compatriots of the motherland to strive for the early realization of the liberation of Taiwan, strive to return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible, and create our prosperous and happy life together with the people of the motherland. We also believe that the families of Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan and overseas will never want to sit idly by and watch your husbands and brothers continue to follow American imperialism and embark on a dead end. We hope that you will advise and encourage your relatives to wake up quickly, stand under the banner of patriotism, and think about the happiness of yourselves and your children and grandchildren, think about maintaining the independence and security of the motherland, and think about defending Asian and world peace, liberate Taiwan, and make meritorious contributions. If you are willing to return to the mainland to visit relatives and friends, or visit and study, the sisters of the motherland will warmly welcome you!

Sisters in Taiwan! Let us unite under the banner of patriotism and work together for the liberation of Taiwan and the cause of the reunification of the motherland!

Dear sisters, friends! On this festival of women all over the world, let us sincerely express our wishes for "peace," "friendship," and "unity" to sisters all over the world! In the past, we and many countries have sent women's delegations to each other and conducted friendly visits. Due to this exchange and contact, our understanding of each other has deepened, our friendship has increased, thereby promoting friendly relations and trust between countries, and strengthening the power to defend world peace, protect children, and fight for women's rights. We are willing to unite with women from all countries, unite all peace forces against war, and transform the already achieved easing of international tensions into stable peace and lasting peace, to ensure the tranquility of our families and the happiness of our children. We shout:

Long live the unity of women all over the world!
Long live "March 8th" International Women's Day!

    在首都各界妇女纪念“三八”国际妇女节大会上的讲话
    中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席　章蕴亲爱的姊妹们！亲爱的朋友们！
    今天我们和首都的各界姊妹、各国使节夫人、来自苏联和各人民民主国家无私地帮助我国建设的女专家和专家夫人们以及正在我国访问的国际朋友们，欢聚一堂，隆重地来纪念我们自己的节日——“三八”国际妇女节，我从心底里感到荣幸和高兴！
    过去的一年，是不平凡的一年。在国际上，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营国家之间的真诚友谊和兄弟般的合作，日益巩固和加强，印度和中国所提倡的著名的五项国际关系原则，在不同社会制度的各国人民之间，愈来愈广泛地受到了欢迎和支持，反殖民主义的人民运动空前高涨，和平力量不断增涨壮大，使得包含巨大危险的紧张的国际局势趋向于缓和。在国内，出现了全国规模的社会主义高潮。继全国几万万农民掀起了农业合作化高潮之后，全国手工业的合作化和资本主义工商业的全行业公私合营跟着进到了高潮，整个国民经济、文化事业也跟着走上了高潮。这一年我们全国各民族、各阶层妇女，女工们，农妇们，女知识分子们以及广大的家庭妇女们是在祖国欣欣向荣的气氛中渡过的，是在祖国进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造过程中，出色地贡献了自己的力量，获得了优良的成绩而渡过的。所以我和大家一起来纪念今年“三八”国际妇女节的时候，也和大家一样满心欢喜，全身是劲！
    今天，在我们妇女自己检阅自己力量的节日里，我首先向大家报告一下：这一年来我国妇女在建设社会主义祖国中所表现的进展和变化。
    这一年来，全国妇女的社会主义觉悟和劳动积极性空前高涨，学习和提高文化的劲头越来越大；生活又进一步改善了，家庭和社会地位有显著的提高了。
    在工业生产战线上，女职工们热火朝天地投入到社会主义劳动竞赛的高潮中，她们自觉地提出提高产量和质量的计划以及实现计划的保证。她们以争取成为社会主义建设积极分子为光荣，她们有着热烈的创造新纪录的愿望。因此，从全国各地的厂矿企业里，不断传出突破定额、创造新纪录的喜讯。首都北京国棉第一、第二厂向全国各棉纺织厂倡议提高产品质量，厉行全面节约，提高生产率的厂际竞赛以后，得到了全国各地棉纺织厂的热烈响应。在这个竞赛中，上海国棉17厂的女工浦玉珍在今年1月创造了皮辊花率下降到0.064％的新纪录，比国家规定的指标减少了一半；接着上海国棉一厂女工王秀兰在今年2月里又创造了皮辊花率下降到0.04％的新纪录。女工按年按月均衡地完成生产计划，已成为普遍的事实。大连造船公司铸钢车间锚链工段的一个女工小组，在1月14日提前一年零十一个半月完成了第一个五年计划。女工们为了超额提前完成五年计划，以主人翁姿态，开动脑筋，提出合理化建议的是越来越多了。为了更好的掌握现代技术，许多女职工热烈地参加了文化和技术的学习。各地厂矿企业订出了在一两年内消灭文盲的计划。上海、天津等城市，决定今年要把职工中的文盲，包括女职工文盲，全部组织入学。
    在农业生产战线上，由于毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”报告和“农业生产合作社示范章程”（草案）、“全国农业发展纲要” （草案）的相继发表和公布，农民走社会主义道路的积极性得到了无比的支持和鼓舞。广大妇女群众同样的热情奔放，争先恐后地参加农业生产合作社和积极地投入农、林、牧、副业生产。她们说：“鸟靠树，鱼靠水，妇女彻底翻身只有依靠合作社。”女社员们，个个精神饱满，人人劲头十足。她们在秋收、积肥、养猪、治虫害、修水利和棉田管理、小麦管理等各种生产中，比往年做出了更多更大的成绩。她们和全体农民共同努力，争取1956年的丰收。为了更好的提高生产，大批妇女正在向文化、技术进军。许多原来一字不识的妇女，现在已经能够看书看报，不少从来没有见过机器的姑娘们，现在已经成为出色的拖拉机手。许多妇女学会了掌握新式农具。全国农业水利系统的女技术人员已有2，540 多人。由于妇女在生产上所表现的成绩，妇女已被社会公认为农业生产中不可缺少的一支大军。许多妇女成了农业生产合作社的领导骨干。一年以前妇女担任农业生产合作社的主任或副主任的还不多，现在绝大多数的农业生产合作社至少有一位女副主任。在生产队里，差不多队队有女队长或副队长。妇女的社会地位大大的提高了。同时，由于生产关系的改变，农村妇女在家庭关系上表现出来的从属地位也随之消失了。妇女与男子在劳动日面前成为平等的成员。民主和睦的家庭普遍地大量的出现。这种新的家庭关系，反过来又促进了男女农民的劳动积极性的高涨。
    全国的女知识分子们，在社会主义革命的高潮中，她们更加热爱自己的祖国和事业，和工人、农民更加紧密的团结，在科学、文化、艺术和教育各方面，以创造性的劳动贡献出她们的力量。她们抱着赶上世界先进科学水平的宏大志愿，在孜孜不息地为提高科学技术、为提高劳动人民的文化水平而努力。全国400多万手工业合作社的女社员们，在手工业社会主义改造高潮中，热情高涨地生产着各种产品。全国政府机关、人民团体的女工作人员，也和全体国家工作人员一起，正在为加速社会主义建设而加紧努力。广大的职工家属和家庭妇女，这一年来在搞好家务，帮助职工搞好生产和工作，参加文化学习方面，都表现了新的成绩。家庭邻里团结互助好，家庭生活安排好，教育子女好，鼓励亲人生产、工作、学习好，自己学习好的“五好”运动在职工家属中普遍地展开了。她们已经成为一支协助政府机关厂矿搞好工作和生产、开展社会、文化、卫生运动的巨大力量。在这里还应该指出：这一年来，资本主义工商业者的家属们也迅速地提高了社会主义觉悟，她们在认真地进行自我学习和自我改造。她们从学习中，从参观工人的劳动中，从企业改造的实践中，认识到劳动的价值和劳动的光荣。在实行公私合营的过程中，许多进步的工商业者家属对鼓励亲友接受社会主义改造方面起了积极的作用。工商业者家属觉悟的提高，说明了社会主义思想在全国各阶层妇女中广泛深刻的影响，也说明了社会主义思想在全国的巨大胜利。
    总的来说：这一年来，全国妇女所表现出来的突出而引人注目的变化，就是一致的不可动摇的建设社会主义祖国的意志和在这个铁一般的意志下所产生的积极行动。
    亲爱的姊妹们，是什么东西有这么大的力量使得我们举国上下，万众一心地这样向往社会主义呢？我们大家一定会异口同声地答复说：历史实践教育了我们，社会主义的优越性启发了我们。确实一点也不错。我们中国妇女和各国人民一样，从多年的亲身感受中，看清了两种制度——社会主义制度和资本主义制度的根本差别。我们从这中间明白了是非，懂得了真理与非真理。我们懂得了社会主义制度同一个国家奴役和掠夺另一个国家的制度，是根本不相同的。社会主义国家一贯支持被压迫民族的民族解放斗争，是坚决反对任何形式的殖民主义的。我们中国人民在被帝国主义奴役掠夺，弄得民穷财尽，文化倒退，生活痛苦不堪，不得不起而进行民族解放斗争的最艰难的岁月里，那时候是谁最同情我们，帮助我们，支持我们的呢？是社会主义的苏联。我们中国人民赢得了人民民主革命胜利之后，又是谁在无私地帮助我国建设呢？也是社会主义的苏联和各个正在建设社会主义的国家。他们无私地兄弟般的帮助我们进行工业建设，实现工业化，使我国从经济上达到独立，从而不断地提高人民的物质和文化生活。因此使我们了解只有在社会主义的思想基础上才能产生真诚无私的国际主义，才能把别人的痛苦看成是自己的痛苦，把别个国家的民族解放事业，看成为自己的事业，关心自己国家人民的幸福，也关心别的国家人民的幸福。帝国主义侵略集团怎样呢？完全相反，他们始终以一付狰狞的面目对待中国人民。在我们解放之前，他们把我国当成他们的贱价劳力和贱价原料的供应地和他们的制成品的销售市场，扼住中国人民的咽喉，把经济命脉掌握在他们的手里，中国人民就是这样受剥削，受奴役一天天更加穷困。我们中国人民挣脱帝国主义的奴役掠夺之后，美帝国主义直到现在还不死心，还想卷土重来，变中国为它的殖民地。为了这个目的，他们还霸占我国领土台湾，建立许多包围中国的军事基地，并无耻的进行各种破坏和颠复活动。很显然，那种制度是世界人类的福音，那种制度是世界人类的威胁和祸害，在我们的眼里是很清楚的。中国人民和中国妇女选择了社会主义制度，坚决走社会主义的道路，这是很自然的。
    还有，我们在进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造的短短的三年里，就已经使我们很明显地看到社会主义的优越性。由于生产关系的改变，社会主义因素的不断增长，生产力获得了相应的不断的发展。很显然我们的工业建设正在有计划地迅速发展着。工业基地正在一个接着一个的出现。新建成的厂、矿，日益加多地投入生产。在资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造中，社会主义优越性也是表现得很明显的。大家都看到加工订货、统购包销、代购代销的低级的国家资本主义形式就比资本主义在生产的提高上有了长足的进步，而公私合营实行定息的高级的国家资本主义形式，又比低级的国家资本主义形式在生产的提高上更有成效。农业社会主义改造所表现的结果也是一样。广大农民已经亲身体验到，半社会主义的农业生产合作社比个体农业经济在生产的提高上有了大的进步，而社会主义的高级农业生产合作社又比半社会主义的初级农业生产合作社在生产的提高上更加卓越。虽然我国建设社会主义还是刚刚开始，但是由于社会主义生产的目的是为了不断提高人民的物质文化生活，所以我们中国人民的物质文化生活已经随着社会主义建设的发展而大大地提高了。这个事实不仅使人们看到了社会主义优越性在今天的表现，而且使人满怀信心地看到了社会主义祖国美丽幸福的前景。这又是全国人民热爱社会主义制度，一心一意坚决走社会主义道路最现实的原因。社会主义是如此与人民的生活福利相关联，它是一条这样美好的使全体人民走向共同富裕的康庄大道，中国人民包括中国妇女在内，大家都喜欢它，拥护它，这也是很自然的。
    我国解放以后，使我国妇女感触最深，体会最切的正是实行社会主义建设和社会主义改造过程中所体现出来的真正的妇女解放。我现在就用农妇们自己的话来表达她们的体会吧！她们说：“办社以前，受三方面的气：受丈夫的气，受婆婆的气，用钱受气。办社以后，得到了三方面的好处：拿到工分第一好，当家作主第二好，有权讲话第三好。”的确，农村妇女，对社会主义的道路就是妇女彻底解放的道路这一真理，从实践中体会得最为深刻。农村妇女过去是最受压迫的，她们没有任何权利，解放以来，她们的权利和社会地位逐步提高了。现在呢？越是建成了高级农业合作社的地区，由于合作社实行了按劳取酬，多劳多得的社会主义原则，又由于高级农业生产合作社大大地解放了生产力，开辟了广泛发展农、副业生产的道路，不但使广大妇女参加生产劳动成为可能而且成为迫切需要。因此，妇女劳动的价值表现出来了，妇女按自己的劳动取得报酬了，显示了妇女的独立的经济地位了。在这样一个事实面前，男女真正平等就随之实现了。我们想想，妇女应该如何的热爱社会主义呢！就以资本主义工商业者家属来说，虽然她们的生活是富裕的，但是，在阶级社会里，她们同样受到歧视，谈不到家庭和社会地位。现在，她们也懂得实行社会主义并不是叫人受穷，而是要大家在没有剥削的共同劳动中不断地发展生产，共同走向富裕，过不断提高的富裕生活。只要她们放弃剥削，接受改造，社会主义的富裕幸福生活，同样也属于她们。在这些活生生的事实面前，中国各阶层妇女，包括资本主义工商业者家属在内，一致向往社会主义，并以无限的热忱参加社会主义建设这也是很自然的。
    亲爱的姊妹们！在建设社会主义祖国中，我们妇女所表现出来的无限忠诚和积极性，是很可宝贵的。这种忠诚和积极性，不仅是保证建成社会主义祖国所需要的，还必须了解我国建设得越好越快，越将增强保卫亚洲和世界和平的力量。我们现在所作的，不仅对自己是有利的，也是对后辈子孙、对世界和平有利的，毛主席说：“我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。”我们把这个事业办好了，我们的后辈会感激我们，全世界爱好和平的人民也会热爱我们。所以我们希望全国妇女，还要进一步地更大地发挥这种对社会主义的忠诚和建设社会主义的积极性，在这不平凡的汹涌澎湃的社会主义革命高潮中，把自己锻炼得更坚强、更勇敢、更有作为。我们要在各种工作岗位上争取作社会主义建设的积极分子和模范人物。全国女工们，要为争取提前和超额完成第一个五年计划而加紧奋斗；全国的农妇们，要为实现全国农业发展纲要四十条，和争取1956年更大的丰产而加紧奋斗；全国的女知识分子要为赶上世界的先进的科学水平而加紧奋斗；全国手工业合作社的女社员们，要为生产更多更好的产品以满足群众的需要而奋斗；全国工商业的家属们，要为进一步帮助和鼓励亲人搞好企业改善经营管理提高生产而努力。亲爱的姊妹们，一年一度的“三八”节，正是我们检阅自己的进步和成绩的日子。让我们以飞速的进步，创造更多更好的成绩来献给我们伟大的祖国，献给全世界一切爱好和平的妇女姊妹吧！
    亲爱的姊妹们！
    正当我们全国人民满怀信心的奔向社会主义，正当我们全国姊妹欢欣鼓舞纪念自己的节日的今天，我们不能不想到台湾的姊妹和台湾的全体人民仍然处在外国的武装统治下过着黑暗的生活。在这里，我们对他们表示衷心的关怀！由于美国使用武力侵占台湾，干涉中国内政，阻碍了台湾的早日得到解放。但是中国人民是一定要解放台湾的，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会周恩来主席在中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第二次全体会议上指出：目前，我们全体中国人民，包括大陆上的人民和台湾人民的共同的爱国责任，就是除了积极准备在必要时候用战争方式解放台湾以外，还要努力争取用和平方式解放台湾，我们相信，具有爱国主义精神的台湾姊妹和台湾全体同胞，必然不甘心长期忍受在外力统治下过着被侮辱被奴役的生活，一定能够勇敢的站起来，和祖国的姊妹，祖国的同胞，共同努力，争取解放台湾的早日实现，争取早日回到祖国的怀抱，和祖国的人民在一起，创造我们繁荣幸福的生活。我们也相信在台湾和海外的国民党军政人员的家属们，决不愿坐视你们的丈夫兄弟，继续追随美国帝国主义而走上绝路。希望你们劝告鼓励你们的亲人，赶快醒悟，站在爱国主义的旗帜下，为你们自己和你们的子女后代幸福着想，为维护祖国的独立和安全，为保卫亚洲与世界和平着想，解放台湾，立功奋斗。如果你们愿意回到大陆来省亲会友，或者参观学习，祖国的姊妹们将会热情的欢迎你们！
    台湾的姊妹们！让我们在爱国主义的旗帜下，团结起来，共同为解放台湾，为祖国的统一事业而奋斗！
    亲爱的姊妹们，朋友们！在这个全世界妇女的节日里，让我们恳切的向全世界姊妹们表达我们“和平”、“友好”、“团结”的愿望吧！过去我们和许多国家，互相派遣了妇女代表团，进行了友谊访问。由于这种往来和接触，使得我们之间的了解加深了，友谊增进了，从而也促进了国与国之间的友好关系和信任，增强了保卫世界和平，保卫儿童和争取妇女权利的力量。我们愿意与各国妇女团结在一起，把一切反对战争的和平力量团结起来，使已经获得的国际紧张局势的缓和，转变为稳定的和平，持久的和平，以确保我们家庭的安宁，儿童的幸福。我们高呼：
    全世界妇女团结万岁！
    “三八”国际妇女节万岁！
