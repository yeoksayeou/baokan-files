Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 18th: Indonesian President Sukarno said at a mass meeting in Malang, East Java, on March 17th: A country composed of different groups and ideologies should have a government that can reflect these different opinions. He made these remarks when talking about the preliminary list of new cabinet members submitted to him by the formateur, Sastroamidjojo. He said that he would announce his decision on the candidates for the new cabinet in Jakarta on the 19th.

The "Dongxing Daily" published a commentary on March 17th saying that President Sukarno's measure of delaying the decision on the preliminary list of new cabinet members proposed by the formateur Sastroamidjojo is reasonable, which shows that he deeply knows his responsibility to the Indonesian people and the country. The newspaper expressed concern that the new cabinet would not receive the enthusiastic support expected by the formateur.

The Indonesian "People's Daily" said on March 17th: The Indonesian people place greater expectations on the next cabinet—the first cabinet formed after the general election—because they demand changes that can bring better conditions. The newspaper called for the establishment of a cabinet that can guarantee national unity. It said that everyone knows that Indonesia's special form of unity is the unity between Muslims, nationalists, and communists.

The newspaper pointed out that the Indonesian Communist Party, which reflects one of these three tendencies, was not invited to participate in the cabinet, while the Masjumi Party, the only party that opposes unity, participated in the government again. The newspaper said that it is only by relying on unity that it is possible to achieve changes that can bring better conditions. Isn't it very obvious? Promoting the situation towards the formation of a cabinet that can guarantee national unity is more necessary now than ever before.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 17th: According to a report by the Indonesian News Agency, the Indonesian formateur, Ali Sastroamidjojo, submitted the list of candidates for the new cabinet to Indonesian President Sukarno on the evening of March 16th. However, Sukarno has not yet expressed his agreement. The new cabinet being formed by Ali Sastroamidjojo is mainly composed of the Indonesian Nationalist Party, the Masjumi Party, and the Nahdlatul Ulama. The parties included in the new cabinet also include people from the Indonesian Islamic Union Party, the Indonesian Christian Party, the Indonesian Catholic Party, the Indonesian Independence Defenders Organization, and the Perti Islamic Party.

Sukarno told reporters after meeting with Sastroamidjojo on the evening of March 16th that Sastroamidjojo had submitted a preliminary list of new cabinet members to him. He said that he would delay the decision on this issue for a day or two, "because there are several names on the preliminary list of cabinet members that I am not very familiar with. I need to learn more about these people."

Sukarno said that the formateur's program is good. Whether the new government can achieve its program depends on the composition of the cabinet and its personnel.

According to today's Jakarta "People's Daily," the Deputy Secretary-General of the Indonesian Communist Party, Lukman, told the press after meeting with Sastroamidjojo on March 16th that the Indonesian Communist Party agreed with the formateur's draft program, but the composition of the new cabinet did not provide a guarantee for the implementation of this program.

    苏加诺认为新的内阁应能反映各种不同意见
    据新华社雅加达18日电　印度尼西亚总统苏加诺3月17日在东爪哇玛琅的一次群众大会上说：一个由不同集团和思想意识组成的国家应该拥有一个能够反映这些不同的意见的政府。他是在谈到组阁人沙斯特罗阿米佐约向他提出的新内阁成员初步名单时说这番话的。他说，他将在19日在雅加达宣布他对新内阁人选的决定。
    “东星报”3月17日发表评论说，总统苏加诺延迟对组阁人沙斯特罗阿米佐约提出的新内阁成员初步名单作出决定的措施是合理的，这表明他深切知道他对印度尼西亚人民和国家的责任。这家报纸表示担心新内阁不会得到组阁人所预期的那样热烈的支持。
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”3月17日说：印度尼西亚人民对下一届内阁——普选后成立的第一届内阁——寄托着更大的期待，因为他们要求实现能带来较好的条件的改变。这家报纸要求成立一个能够保证全国团结的内阁。它说，任何人都知道，印度尼西亚的特殊形式的团结是回教徒、民族主义者和共产主义者之间的团结。
    这家报纸指出，反映这三种倾向之一的印度尼西亚共产党没有被邀请参加内阁，而唯一反对团结的政党马斯友美党却再度参加了政府。这家报纸说，只有依靠团结才有可能实现能够带来较好的条件的改变，这难道不是很明显的吗？促使局势朝着组成一个能保证全国团结的内阁的方向走，这在目前是比过去任何时候都更有必要了。
    据新华社雅加达17日电　据印度尼西亚新闻社报道，印度尼西亚组阁人阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约在3月16日晚上向印度尼西亚总统苏加诺提出了新内阁的人选。但是苏加诺还没有表示同意。阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约筹组的新内阁主要是由印度尼西亚国民党、马斯友美党和回教师联合会组成的，被包括在新内阁的政党还有印度尼西亚回教联盟党、印度尼西亚基督教党、印度尼西亚共和国天主教党、印度尼西亚独立保卫者组织和白尔蒂回教党的人士。
    苏加诺3月16日晚上在同沙斯特罗阿米佐约举行会谈以后对新闻记者说，沙斯特罗阿米佐约向他提出了新内阁成员的初步名单。他说，他将延迟一两天再就这个问题作出决定，“因为在内阁成员的初步名单上有几个名字我不太熟悉。我需要再了解一些关于这些人的情况”。
    苏加诺说，组阁人的纲领是好的。新政府能否实现它的纲领要看内阁的组成和它的人员而定。
    据今天的雅加达“人民日报”报道，印度尼西亚共产党副总书记鲁克曼3月16日在同沙斯特罗阿米佐约会谈以后对报界发表谈话说，印度尼西亚共产党同意组阁人的政纲草案，但是新内阁的组成并没有提供实现这个政纲的保证。
