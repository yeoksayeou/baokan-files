Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 27th - The work teams sent by the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front to support the agricultural cooperation movement have helped Fujian farmers establish and consolidate many agricultural producers' cooperatives. The officers and soldiers of the work teams have also actively participated in the current rural production activities, resulting in some moving examples. For example, Zhou Xiangshun, a platoon leader of a machine gun company, dug wells and accumulated fertilizer with the masses. During one well-digging operation, the well mouth suddenly collapsed, and a farmer was trapped in the well by stones and sand. Zhou Xiangshun disregarded the danger and jumped into the well to rescue the trapped farmer.

The work teams sent by the People's Liberation Army have won the trust and love of the farmers. Farmers in some places have requested that the work teams send people to be responsible for the work at a base point; some farmers turn to the work teams for help when they encounter difficulties in their work. The masses in Mianzhou Township, Jinjiang County, said that the People's Liberation Army really cares about us. They helped us distribute land during the land reform; now they are here again to help us embark on the road of agricultural cooperation.

    福建省各地农民欢迎解放军农村工作队
    新华社福州27日电　福建前线中国人民解放军派出的支援农业合作化运动的工作队，帮助福建农民建立和整顿了许多个农业生产合作社。工作队的官兵们还积极参加当前农村的生产活动，出现了一些令人感动的事例。如某部机枪连排长周镶胜，和群众一起打井、积肥。在一次打井当中，井口突然坍塌，一个农民被石头和沙土压在井内，周镶胜不顾危险跳下井去，救出了遇险的农民。
    解放军派出的工作队赢得了农民的信任和热爱。有的地方的农民，要求工作队派人负责一个基点的工作；有的农民在工作中遇到困难，便找工作队帮助解决。晋江县绵州乡的群众说，解放军对我们真是关心，土地改革的时候帮助我们分土地；现在又来帮助我们走农业合作化的道路。
