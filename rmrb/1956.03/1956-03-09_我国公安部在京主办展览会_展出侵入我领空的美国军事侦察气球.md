Xinhua News Agency, March 8th. An exhibition of U.S. military reconnaissance balloons that intruded into China's airspace, sponsored by the Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China, opened on the 7th in Zhongshan Park, Beijing.

The balloons exhibited are only a portion of the U.S. military reconnaissance balloons intercepted by China. All equipment from this portion of the balloons is displayed in the exhibition room. This includes the balloon body and the military reconnaissance cameras suspended beneath it, as well as parachutes, radio transceivers, storage batteries providing power, and other equipment installed to serve the military reconnaissance cameras. The balloon body is made of plastic and is approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter. The suspended objects beneath the balloon weigh approximately 600 kilograms.

A schematic diagram at the exhibition indicates that the U.S. military reconnaissance balloons intrude into China's airspace from the west with the westerly jet stream (a fast-flowing stream of air that encircles the Earth). They can drift from west to east at altitudes above 12,000 meters and take photographs for military use.

Many parts of the balloons exhibited bear the letters "USA." Some parts also bear the names and brands of the American companies that manufactured them: "Hayden" Manufacturing Company, "Ray-O-Vac" Company, "Mylar" brand, "McAlekro" brand, etc.

People paid particular attention to the main component of the military reconnaissance balloon—the military reconnaissance camera. This camera consists of a reconnaissance camera for taking terrain images and a recorder camera. The reconnaissance camera has two lenses and can take 23-minute square photographs of terrain and features for military use. The recorder camera's task is to record technical data such as the time, altitude, and photo number each time the reconnaissance camera is exposed, in order to determine the ground location of each photo taken by the reconnaissance camera.

From the photos taken by the exhibited U.S. military reconnaissance cameras, mountains, rivers, cities, seaports, and airports can be clearly seen. Many terrain photos taken by the U.S. military reconnaissance cameras in China's airspace are also on display at the exhibition. Among them are photos of the Luan River area in Hebei Province. Next to the photos of the Luan River area is a map of the Luan River area in China, which is identical to the photos. The explanation below these photos states that the United States is placing military reconnaissance balloons into China's airspace to conduct reconnaissance photography of China's territory, which is a violation of China's sacred airspace. This behavior by the United States is a serious provocation against China.

On the 7th and 8th, personnel from embassies of many countries in China, Chinese and foreign journalists, cadres from Beijing municipal organs, and citizens visited the exhibition. An audience member with the name "A Group of Visitors" wrote in the exhibition's guestbook: "The evidence is irrefutable. The U.S. government cannot deny its crime of placing military reconnaissance balloons into the airspace of China, the Soviet Union, and various people's democratic countries." (Attached photo)

The exhibition of U.S. military reconnaissance balloons that intruded into China's airspace opened on March 7th. This is a scene of visitors viewing the military reconnaissance automatic camera box installed on the American-made balloon intercepted by us.

### 我国公安部在京主办展览会  展出侵入我领空的美国军事侦察气球

    我国公安部在京主办展览会
    展出侵入我领空的美国军事侦察气球
    新华社8日讯　中华人民共和国公安部主办的侵入我国领空的美国军事侦察气球展览会，7日在北京中山公园开幕。
    展览会上展出的气球，只是被我国所截获的美国军事侦察气球中的一部分。这一部分气球的全部设备都陈列在展览室里。其中有球体和球下悬挂的军事侦察摄影机以及为军事侦察摄影机服务而装置的降落伞、无线电收发报机、供给电源的蓄电池等设备。球体是一种塑胶制品，它的直径约30到40英尺。球体下的悬挂物重约600公斤。
    展览会上一幅示意图标明美国军事侦察气球，是随着西风激流带（是一种环绕地球的快速流动的气流）从西方侵入我国领空的。它可以在12，000公尺以上的高空中由西向东飘行，并且摄取供军事使用的照片。
    展览会上展出的气球的许多零件上都有USA的字样。有些零件上还有制造这些零件的美国公司的名称和牌号：“海登”制造公司、“雷奥伐克”公司、“麦洛来”牌、“麦埃克罗”牌等。
    人们特别注意军事侦察气球的主体——军事侦察摄影机。这个摄影机由用以摄取地形的侦察摄影机和记录器摄影机两部分组成。侦察摄影机有两个镜头，可以摄23分见方的供军事使用的地形地物的像片。记录器摄影机的任务是记录侦察摄影机每次曝光时的时间、高度、摄影号次等技术资料，以便判断侦察摄影机所摄的每张照片的地面位置。
    从展出的美国军事侦察摄影机所拍摄的照片中，可以清楚地看出山脉、河流、城市、海港、飞机场。美国军事侦察摄影机在我国领空拍摄的许多地形照片也在展览会上展出。其中有河北省滦河区域的照片。在滦河区域照片的旁边，贴着一张我国滦河区域地形图，它与照片完全相同。在这些照片下面的说明中说，美国把军事侦察气球，放入我国领空，对我国领土进行侦察摄影，这是美国对我国的神圣领空的破坏。美国这种行为是对我国的严重挑衅。
    7日和8日，许多国家的驻华使馆人员、中外记者、北京市的机关干部和市民等参观了展览会。有一个署名“一群参观者”的观众在展览会的留言簿上写道：铁证如山，美国政府怎样也抵赖不了把军事侦察气球放入我国、苏联和各人民民主国家领空的罪行。（附图片）
    侵入我国领空的美国军事侦察气球展览会在3月7日开幕。这是观众们参观被我截获的美制气球上装制的军事侦察自动摄影箱的情形。
