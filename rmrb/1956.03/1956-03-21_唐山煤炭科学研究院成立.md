Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, March 20th – China’s first coal science research institution, the Tangshan Coal Science Research Institute, and the Kailuan Branch of the Beijing Coal Mine Design Institute were simultaneously established in Tangshan today.

    In the past, due to the absence of coal science research institutions, various problems encountered at coal mine production sites could not be resolved promptly. Many innovations and improvements made by workers could not be summarized and elevated with advanced science. In coal mine capital construction, the design lagged behind the construction, seriously affecting the speed of coal mine construction and production development. The establishment of the Coal Science Research Institute and the Design Branch is to quickly change this backward situation. The current tasks of these two institutions are mainly to help Kailuan Coal Mine research and solve key problems such as shaft sinking, geology, surveying, and coal preparation, as well as to help Kailuan Coal Mine design new mine shafts and many expansion and renovation projects, while also training coal science research and design personnel.

    唐山煤炭科学研究院成立
    据新华社唐山20日电　中国第一个煤炭科学研究机构——唐山煤炭科学研究院，今天和北京煤矿设计院开滦分院同时在唐山成立。
    过去，由于没有煤炭科学研究机构，在煤矿生产现场中所遇到的各种问题不能及时解决。工人们的许多创造和改进，也不能用先进的科学去加以总结和提高。在煤矿基本建设中，由于设计赶不上施工，严重地影响了煤矿建设速度和生产的发展。成立煤炭科学研究院和设计分院就是为了迅速改变这种落后状况。这两个机构的当前任务主要是帮助开滦煤矿研究和解决凿井、地质、测量和选煤等关键问题，以及帮助开滦煤矿设计新矿井和许多扩建、改建工程，同时培养煤炭科学研究和设计人员。
