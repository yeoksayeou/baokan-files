    Oppose Lowering Product Quality
    Zhang Qian
    Recently, in the new high tide of socialist competition, some industrial enterprises, due to not correctly and comprehensively implementing the policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical," have exhibited a phenomenon of focusing only on quantity and neglecting quality. In response to this situation, the Tianjin Daily, in its publicity during the first half of March, timely raised this noteworthy issue.
    On March 5th, the Tianjin Daily published a short article titled "Breaking Production Quotas Must Pay Attention to Product Quality." The short article exposed the phenomenon of the jointly-owned public-private Minzhong Tobacco Factory lowering product quality. Since February 26th, although this factory has continuously broken production quotas, the decline in product quality has been very serious. For example, packing empty cigarettes as good cigarettes, and so on. Why has this phenomenon occurred? The Tianjin Daily pointed out that this is mainly because the leaders in the factory did not properly educate the workers to pay attention to improving product quality when the workers were breaking production quotas. On the contrary, they blindly praised the practice of only caring about quantity and not quality. This has led the workers' enthusiasm for labor in the wrong direction, causing great waste in production. In short articles and editorials on March 11th and 15th, the newspaper further exposed and criticized the facts of some industrial enterprises blindly pursuing output and causing quality accidents; the editorial also required the leaders of these enterprises to treat ensuring quality as a major event in the competition to be resolved.
    In addition to paying attention to exposing typical cases of neglecting product quality, the Tianjin Daily also praised the correct practice of combining breaking production quotas with improving quality. This method of comparing good and bad will obviously strengthen the publicity effect. The newspaper introduced that when the workers of the Jinan Leather Factory continuously broke production quotas, the leaders promptly criticized and educated some workers for their sloppy operations that reduced product quality, so that the decline in product quality was quickly corrected.
    It is worth mentioning that the Tianjin Daily has relatively frequently conducted publicity on quality issues in the past. Since December of last year, it has continuously published a large number of letters from consumers, commercial workers, and factory employees, exposing the serious situation of poor quality of light industrial products and some production materials produced in Tianjin. This kind of exposure is sometimes accompanied by cartoons and short commentaries. When those who were criticized accepted the opinions of the masses and began to improve product quality, the newspaper reported on their improvement. In industrial production, the phenomenon of low product quality is relatively serious. In order to help factories and enterprises change this situation, it is very necessary for the Tianjin Daily to frequently raise issues related to product quality.

    反对降低产品质量
    张浅
    最近在社会主义竞赛的新高潮里，有些工业企业由于没有正确地全面贯彻又多又快又好又省的方针，出现了只顾数量不顾质量的现象。针对这个情况，天津日报在三月份前半月的宣传中，及时地提出了这个值得注意的问题。
    在三月五日的天津日报上，登出了一篇短文“突破产量定额必须注意产品质量”。短文中揭露了公私合营民众烟草厂降低产品质量的现象。这个厂自从二月二十六日以来，虽然连续突破产量定额，但是产品质量下降的情况也很严重。例如把空头烟当做好烟包装等等。为什么会造成这种现象呢？天津日报指出了：这主要是因为厂里的领导者在工人突破产量定额的时候，没有很好地教育工人注意提高产品的质量；相反地，还盲目地表扬了只顾产量不顾质量的作法。这样就把工人的劳动热情引向错误的方向，给生产造成了很大的浪费。在三月十一日和十五日的短文和社论里，报纸又揭露和批判了一些工业企业盲目追求产量发生质量事故的事实；社论并且要求这些企业的领导者，把保证质量当做竞赛中的一件大事来加以解决。
    天津日报除了注意揭露忽视产品质量的典型事例外，又表扬了把突破产品定额同提高质量结合起来的正确作法。这种好坏对比的方法，显然会加强宣传效果。报纸介绍了津南制革厂的领导者在工人连续突破生产定额的时候，对部分工人的操作草率降低产品质量的作法，及时进行了批评和教育，这样就使产品质量下降的情况很快得到纠正。
    值得提出的是，天津日报过去就比较经常地进行了质量问题的宣传。从去年十二月份起，它曾经连续发表消费者、商业工作人员、工厂职工的大量来信，揭露天津市生产的轻工业品和一部分生产资料质量不好的严重情况。这种揭露有时还配上漫画和短小的评论。当被批评者接受群众意见着手改进产品质量的时候，报纸又报道了他们的改进情况。在工业生产中，产品质量不高的现象是比较严重的。天津日报为了帮助工厂企业改变这种状况，经常地提出产品质量方面的问题，是非常必要的。
