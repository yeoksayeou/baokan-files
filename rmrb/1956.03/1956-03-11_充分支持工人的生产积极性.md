    Fully Support the Production Enthusiasm of Workers

    As the high tide of socialist transformation in agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce successively emerged, and the Party and the state put forward the call to strive for early and over-fulfillment of the Five-Year Plan, the socialist enthusiasm of workers, technicians, and management personnel in factories and mines across the country has soared unprecedentedly, and a new high tide of industrial production is forming. This is a new phenomenon on the industrial production front. This situation requires leaders of factories and mines to quickly adopt effective measures to guide the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers towards solving major problems in production and management, so as to lay a good foundation for the early and over-fulfillment of the state plan.

    In order to achieve this goal, the Party organizations and administrative leaders of enterprises should quickly submit the plans and targets stipulated by the state to the masses for discussion, resolutely change the past practice of first within the Party and then outside the Party, first cadres and then the masses, transmitting and discussing level by level. During the discussion process, it is necessary to quickly mobilize the masses of workers to expose and criticize all conservative ideas, put forward specific methods for completing the state plan ahead of schedule and exceeding it, and study them layer by layer from the work team and workshop to the factory headquarters, balance them level by level, discover advanced experiences, and quickly promote them; find weak links and try to overcome them, and then determine the plan on this basis, compile a comprehensive plan for the enterprise's work, and report it to the central industrial management authorities for examination and approval. Facts have proved that when this is done, leaders can quickly overcome conservative ideas, stand in front of the masses, and lead the masses forward. Factory 53 has achieved good results in this regard. When the enthusiasm of the masses was high, the Party committee and administrative leaders of Factory 53 decided, based on the new situation, to adopt the method of direct meetings between leaders and the masses, assigning leaders at all levels to go deep into the masses of workers, listen to the opinions and demands of the masses of workers, and study key issues in production and issues of leadership style together with the masses of workers. After the initial determination of the state plan, the Party committee and administrative leaders immediately organized the masses of workers to discuss it, and mobilized the masses of workers to first tap potential and propose measures, and then set the targets for over-fulfilling the plan. This approach was warmly welcomed and supported by the masses of workers. The masses of workers quickly exposed some shortcomings in the work and put forward many opinions on improving the work. Based on the opinions of the masses of workers, the factory leaders quickly put forward the target of completing this year's state plan 82 days ahead of schedule, and made a comprehensive plan for the enterprise.

    Some units are still adopting the method of sitting in the office and closing the door to compile plans and determine various production targets, and as a result, they are often affected by conservative ideas from among the leaders, and it is impossible to formulate advanced and reliable plans. Why does this phenomenon occur? Are our enterprise leading cadres particularly backward and untrustworthy? Of course, this is not the case. The vast majority of our enterprise administrative leading cadres and the masses also have soaring socialist enthusiasm and are willing to do their work more, faster, better, and more economically, but because their ways of thinking and leadership methods still have shortcomings, such as not going deep enough into the masses, not observing problems comprehensively, etc., they still cannot see the huge potential power hidden in the masses, or they cannot see the new favorable conditions and favorable factors in the work, and they often unconsciously still consider problems according to the old habits and old experiences of the past. This inevitably leads to insufficient confidence in completing the state plan ahead of schedule and exceeding it, overestimating the difficulties, and other conservative ideas. In this case, the task of the Party organization is to effectively help the administrative leaders and the masses of workers to closely combine, and to mobilize the masses of workers to discuss methods for completing the plan ahead of schedule, so that the administrative leaders can see the wisdom and strength of the masses, and believe that the wisdom and strength of the masses are infinite, thereby overcoming conservative ideas. Facts have proved that as long as the Party organization conducts sufficient publicity, education, and organizational work among the masses of workers, the masses of workers will not only make practical criticisms of the shortcomings and errors in the leadership work, but also put forward many rationalization proposals for improving the work. For example, the leading cadres of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant previously underestimated the potential power of Workshop No. 1, and only assigned tasks to Workshop No. 1 according to the state plan targets. The director of the workshop and other responsible cadres also emphasized that their workshop was a "weak link" and initially only prepared to complete 113.3% of the state plan. However, after the workshop branch helped and coordinated with the workshop administrative leading cadres to gradually mobilize the masses and found ways to strengthen the weak links, the production targets gradually increased, and finally it was determined to complete 130% of the state plan, and the factory's plan targets were also increased as a result. Workers not only put forward various improvement opinions and rationalization proposals, but also broke through new quotas one after another. In the first ten days of January, the average of the entire workshop exceeded the new quota by 26.5%, and in the middle ten days, it exceeded 72.5%. This shows that as long as the leadership is strengthened from top to bottom, the masses are fully mobilized from bottom to top, and the leadership and the masses are closely combined, conservative ideas can be overcome and a plan that is both advanced and reliable can be formulated.

    However, making an advanced and reliable plan is only the beginning of the matter. More importantly, it is necessary to organize the production enthusiasm of the masses, persevere in it, and make it a powerful and lasting production movement to ensure the realization of the advanced plan. This requires quickly formulating collective contracts based on the enterprise's plan, carrying out socialist competitions within and between factories, and taking various effective measures to encourage the continued upsurge of the competition. This requires paying attention to promoting advanced experiences, especially the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union, encouraging the rationalization proposals of the masses, and taking appropriate measures to ensure that rationalization proposals can be quickly realized and promoted. It is necessary to pay attention to advocating learning technology and mastering technology, opening various amateur technical schools and technical training classes suitable for production requirements and the requirements of the masses of workers, so as to continuously improve the technical level of workers. It is necessary to pay attention to appropriately revising the quotas on the basis of the already improved labor productivity, and appropriately revising the outdated operating procedures and management systems on the basis of effective advanced experiences, so as to gradually consolidate the achievements of the mass production movement. It is necessary to pay attention to promptly improving the wage system and reward system, and promptly solving all necessary and possible worker welfare problems, so as to use the role of material incentives to keep the masses enthusiastic and promote the continuous advancement of the production movement. Especially important is to pay attention to preventing the deviation of simply pursuing quantity regardless of quality that is prone to occur in the competition movement. It is necessary to closely combine "more, faster, better, and more economical." It is necessary to achieve more and faster on the premise of ensuring better and more economical, that is to say, it is necessary to strive to complete the state plan ahead of schedule and exceed it on the premise of improving quality and saving raw materials and funds. In short, it is necessary to emphasize the comprehensive completion of the state plan, the comprehensive completion of the various indicators stipulated by the state, not only to complete the total product value plan, but also to focus on completing the quality plan, cost plan, and new product trial production plan. Poor quality, high costs, and poor trial production of new products are major shortcomings in current industrial production. The task of enterprise leaders is to fully promote the socialist enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, guide them to pay attention to improving quality, reducing costs, and accelerating the trial production process of new products in the current upsurge of the mass production movement, so as to ensure the early and over-fulfillment of the state plan in a comprehensive manner.

### 充分支持工人的生产积极性

    充分支持工人的生产积极性
    当农业、手工业和私营工商业的社会主义改造高潮相继出现，党和国家提出争取提前和超额完成五年计划的号召以后，各地厂矿企业的工人、技术人员、管理人员的社会主义积极性空前高涨，一个新的工业生产高潮正在形成中。这是工业生产战线上的新气象。这种情况，要求厂矿企业的领导者迅速采取有效的办法，把广大职工群众的热情引导到解决生产和管理工作中的重大问题上去，为提前和超额完成国家计划奠定一个良好的开端。
    为了达到这个目的，企业的党组织和行政领导者，就应该迅速把国家规定的计划和指标提交群众讨论，坚决改变过去习惯了的先党内后党外、先干部后群众逐级传达逐级讨论的作法。在讨论过程中，要尽快地发动职工群众揭发和批判一切保守思想，提出提前并超额完成国家计划的具体办法，并从班组、车间到厂部，层层研究，逐级平衡，发现先进经验，迅速加以推广；找出薄弱环节，设法加以克服，然后在这个基础上来确定计划，编制企业工作的全面规划，报告中央工业管理机关审查批准。事实证明，凡是这样做了的，领导者就能迅速地克服保守思想，站在群众的前面，领导群众前进。五三工厂在这方面已经取得了很好的效果。当群众的热情高涨起来的时候，五三工厂党委和行政领导根据新的情况，决定采取领导和群众直接见面的办法，指定各级领导人员深入职工群众，听取职工群众的意见和要求，同职工群众一起研究生产中的关键问题和领导作风问题。在国家计划初步确定之后，党委和行政领导方面立即组织职工群众讨论，并且发动职工群众首先挖掘潜力，提出措施，然后定出超额完成计划的指标。这种作法受到了职工群众的热烈欢迎和支持。职工群众很快地揭发了工作中的若干缺点和提出了很多关于改进工作的意见。根据职工群众的意见，工厂领导很快地提出了提前82天完成今年国家计划的指标，并且作出了企业的全面规划。
    有一些单位，目前仍然采取坐在办公室里关起门来编制规划和确定各项生产指标的办法，结果是往往受到来自领导者中间的保守思想的影响，不可能订出先进而可靠的计划。为什么会产生这种现象呢？是我们的企业领导干部特别落后、不可信任吗？当然不是这样的。我们的绝大多数企业行政领导干部和群众同样具有高涨的社会主义积极性，愿意把工作作得又多、又快、又好、又省，但是因为他们的思想方法和领导方法还有缺点，例如深入群众不够，观察问题不全面等等，因而，他们还看不见群众中蕴藏着的巨大的潜在力量，或者还看不到工作中的新的有利条件和有利因素，常常不自觉地仍然按照过去的老习惯老经验考虑问题。这就不免会产生对提前和超额完成国家计划的信心不足，对困难估计得过高等等保守思想。在这种情况下，党组织的任务就是要一方面有效地帮助行政领导者和职工群众密切结合起来；一方面发动职工群众，讨论提前完成计划的办法，让行政领导者看到群众的智慧和力量，相信群众的智慧和力量是无穷的，从而克服保守思想。事实证明，只要党组织对职工群众进行充分的宣传教育和组织工作，职工群众不但会对领导工作中的缺点和错误提出切实的批评，而且会提出许多改进工作的合理化建议。举个例子：沈阳第一机床厂的领导干部过去对一号车间的潜在力量估计不足，只是按国家计划指标给一号车间下达任务。车间主任等负责干部也强调本车间是个“薄弱环节”，开始时只准备完成国家计划的113.3％。但是经过车间支部帮助并协同车间行政领导干部，一步步地深入发动群众，找出了加强薄弱环节的办法后，生产指标就逐步提高，最后确定完成国家计划的130％，并且使厂的计划指标也因之提高。工人不但提出各种改进意见和合理化建议，还纷纷突破新的定额，一月上旬全车间平均超过新定额26.5％，中旬超过72.5％。这就表明，只要自上而下加强领导，自下而上充分发动群众，领导与群众密切结合，就能克服保守思想，订出既先进而又可靠的计划。
    但是，作出先进而可靠的计划，还只是事情的开始，更重要的是要把群众的生产积极性组织起来，坚持下去，使之成为强大的、持久的生产运动，以保证先进计划的实现。这就必须迅速根据企业的计划，订立集体合同，开展厂内和厂际的社会主义竞赛，并采取各种有效的办法，鼓励竞赛热潮的继续高涨。这就必须注意推广先进经验，特别是苏联的先进经验，鼓励群众的合理化建议，并采取妥善办法使合理化建议能迅速实现和推行。必须注意提倡学习技术，掌握技术，开办各种各样适合于生产要求和职工群众要求的业余技术学校和技术训练班，以不断提高职工的技术水平。必须注意在已经提高了的劳动生产率的基础上，适当修改定额，在行之有效的先进经验的基础上，适当修改陈旧了的工艺规程和管理制度，把群众生产运动的成绩逐步巩固起来。必须注意及时改进工资制度和奖励制度，及时解决一切必需而又可能解决的职工福利问题，以便通过物质鼓励的作用，使群众热情经常饱满，推动生产运动不断前进。尤其重要的，是要注意防止在竞赛运动中容易发生的单纯追求数量不顾质量的偏差，必须使“又多、又快、又好、又省”密切结合，必须在保证又好又省的条件下来达到又多又快，也就是说，必须在提高质量，节约原材料和资金的条件下，争取提前和超额完成国家计划。总之，要强调全面地完成国家计划，全面完成国家规定的各项指标，不仅要完成产品总值计划，而且要着重注意完成质量计划、成本计划和新品种试制计划。质量差，成本高，新品种试制不好，正是目前工业生产中的重大缺点，企业领导者的任务，就是要在目前职工群众生产运动高潮中，充分发扬群众的社会主义积极性和创造性，引导他们注意提高质量、降低成本、加速新品种的试制过程，这样来保证提前和超额地全面完成国家计划。
