Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Over five thousand Beijing youths began this spring's first large-scale greening activity yesterday on the hillside behind the Babaoshan Revolutionary Martyrs' Cemetery. On this day, they completed land preparation for half the mountain. It is expected that seventy thousand trees will be planted on this hillside by April 1st. In addition, the capital's gardeners have been digging pits and transplanting seedlings on roads such as Deqing Road these days. Students from Beijing universities and colleges have also begun greening their campuses.

This year, Beijing plans to plant 17.04 million trees, equivalent to double the total number of trees planted in the past seven years. This spring, twelve areas in the city's streets will be laid with green spaces and converted into gardens. Seventeen roads, totaling one hundred and fifty kilometers in length, will be transformed into tree-lined avenues, with 120,000 trees planted along the roads, equal to twelve times the total number of street trees in the entire city before liberation. Thirty varieties of saplings will be planted on these streets, including new varieties such as French plane trees and Manchurian maple trees.

    北京大规模绿化活动开始
    新华社19日讯　北京五千多名青年昨天在八宝山革命烈士公墓后侧的山坡上开始了今年春季第一次大规模的绿化活动。这一天，他们完成了半个山的整地工作。预计到四月一日，将有七万棵树种满在这个山坡上。此外，首都的园林工人这些天来正在德清路等道路上挖坑移植树苗。北京高等学校的学生也开始了绿化校园的活动。
    今年，北京计划种植树木1，704万株，相当于过去七年植树总数的一倍。今年春天，城区的街道上有十二个地方要铺设绿地，辟为花园。有全长一百五十公里的十七条道路要变成林荫道，路旁植树十二万株，等于解放前全城行道树总数的十二倍。在这些街道上栽种的树苗有三十种，其中有法国梧桐、元宝枫等新的品种。
