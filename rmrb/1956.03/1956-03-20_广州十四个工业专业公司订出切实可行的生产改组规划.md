Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 19th: Guangzhou's fourteen industrial professional companies, after conducting in-depth investigations into the situations of various industries, have formulated practical and feasible production reorganization plans. These plans generally strive to minimize factory changes, expansions, and investments, adhering to the principle of benefiting production. The original plan, which proposed merging all 42 factories in the button industry into one large factory at once, has now been revised to merge them into six factories. This avoids completely disrupting the original production structures while appropriately allocating equipment and manpower among the factories. For example, Zhang Xinji Button Factory, the largest in the industry, is located near eleven small button factories. Most of these smaller factories are poorly managed; some lack specialized technicians, and others lack lathes. In the past, they frequently incurred losses due to low quality and high costs, making it difficult to sustain production. This plan merges these eleven small factories into Zhang Xinji Button Factory, which can be completed in just one or two days with minimal relocation costs. After the merger, the equipment can be balanced, and technical expertise can be concentrated, changing the previous abnormal production state. The motor sawmill industry's plan generally preserves the factories in the urban area with relatively good equipment and appropriately merges them. For example, Rongxingtai Sawmill, which has convenient land and water transportation, is located near Shengtaili and Wanxinlong sawmills. The plan stipulates merging these two factories into Rongxingtai Factory, reducing wood transportation costs and lowering production costs. The plan also stipulates merging and relocating eleven small factories in the urban area with unsuitable locations and outdated technology to some more advanced factories in the suburbs. This caters to the purchasing convenience of urban customers and appropriately solves the past problem of uneven factory distribution in this industry.

　　In the early stage of formulating production reorganization plans for joint state-private industrial enterprises in Guangzhou, cadres doing this work one-sidedly believed that large factories were easier to manage, or that large factories "looked like factories." As a result, most of the plans merged factories too much, made too many changes, and required a large amount of state investment and factory expansion. For example, the motor sawmill industry, in its pursuit of large factories, did not fully consider how to facilitate customer purchases and worker commutes, and planned to relocate 27 factories located in the urban area to the suburbs. The motor weaving industry's plan included nine units requiring expansion or renovation, totaling more than 500,000 yuan in state investment. After discovering this deviation, the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party promptly conducted inspections and corrections.

    广州十四个工业专业公司订出切实可行的生产改组规划
    新华社广州19日电　广州市十四个工业专业公司，在深入调查了各行业的情况后，订出了切实可行的生产改组规划方案。这些规划一般都做到在有利于生产的原则下，尽量使工厂暂时少变动，少扩建，少投资。原来规划把全业42个工厂一次并成一个大厂的揿钮行业，现在已经确定并成六个厂，这样既避免全部打乱原来的生产机构，又适当调配了各厂的设备和人力。如这个行业最大的张新记揿钮厂的邻近有十一家小揿钮厂，它们多数经营混乱，有的厂没有专门技工，有的厂没有车床，过去经常因质量低和成本高使工厂亏本，无法维持生产。这次规划把这十一个小厂并入张新记揿钮厂，只要一两天就可迁厂完毕，所化的搬迁费很少，而合并后设备可以达到平衡，技术力量也能够集中使用，改变了以往生产不正常状态。电机锯木业的规划中把市区那些原来设备较好的厂一般都保留下来，并且适当加以合并。如水陆交通方便的荣兴泰锯木厂的邻近有生泰和万新隆两锯木厂，规划确定把这两厂并入荣兴泰厂，这样就因搬运木材的费用减少，生产成本可以降低。规划还确定把十一户在市区地点不适宜和技术较陈旧落后的小厂并迁到郊区一些较先进的厂中去。这样一方面照顾了市区顾客的购买方便，又适当解决了过去这个行业工厂分布不平衡的现象。
    广州市各工业专业公司在制订公私合营工业生产改组规划的初期，由于做这一工作的干部片面地认为搞大工厂好管理，或认为大工厂“才像个工厂的样子”，因而大部分的规划都把工厂并得太大，变动很多，而且要求国家大量投资和扩建工厂。如电机锯木业为了要搞大厂，没有充分考虑到如何便利顾客购买和使工人上下班方便等问题，准备把设在市区的27户工厂迁往郊区。电机织布业的规划中就有九户要扩建或改建，共需国家投资五十多万元。中共广州市委员会发现这一偏向后，迅速作了检查和纠正。
