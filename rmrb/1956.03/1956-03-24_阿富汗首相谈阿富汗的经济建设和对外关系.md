Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, March 22nd (TASS) - Afghan Prime Minister Mohammed Daoud delivered a radio address on the New Year (the Islamic New Year begins on March 21st).

In his speech, Daoud spoke about the achievements Afghanistan had made in the past year, as well as plans for further developing the Afghan economy. He said that Afghanistan's five-year plan for economic development had been drafted.

Daoud pointed out that the main focus in the country's overall economic plan was on increasing electricity production. It is expected that the country's electricity production will increase from 144 million kilowatt-hours to 850 million kilowatt-hours by the completion of the five-year plan.

Daoud continued, saying that Afghanistan's situation in international life over the past year was satisfactory. The foundation of Afghanistan's foreign relations is the principle of maintaining universal peace and neutrality, and maintaining friendly and brotherly relations with all peace-loving countries in the world. The Afghan government is committed to strengthening friendly relations with other countries on the basis of mutual respect, maintenance and defense of world peace. Consolidating security in the Middle East is Afghanistan's main desire.

Daoud then said that the situation of developing and maintaining friendly relations with neighboring countries was satisfactory. Pakistan is the only country with which Afghanistan has not been able to resolve political differences. Daoud said that Pakistan's policy on the Pashtunistan issue is the sole reason for these differences.

He went on to point out that, since Afghanistan has noted the need to maintain peace and security, it has never missed any opportunity to strive for consultation with the Pakistani government to resolve the Pashtunistan issue. Afghanistan believes that the resolution of the Pashtunistan issue is necessary for maintaining peace and security in the region.

    阿富汗首相谈阿富汗的经济建设和对外关系
    新华社据塔斯社喀布尔22日讯　阿富汗首相穆罕默德·达乌德在新年（伊斯兰教国家的新年从三月二十一日开始）发表了广播演说。
    达乌德在演说中谈到了阿富汗国家在过去一年中获得的成绩，以及进一步发展阿富汗经济的计划。他说，阿富汗发展经济的五年计划已经编制好了。
    达乌德指出，在国家总的经济计划中，主要的注意力放在增加电力生产方面。预计全国的电力生产到五年计划完成时将从一亿四千四百万度增加到八亿五千万度。
    达乌德继续说，过去一年阿富汗在国际生活方面的情况是令人满意的。阿富汗对外关系的基础是维护普遍和平和中立的原则以及同世界上一切爱好和平的国家保持友好和兄弟的关系。阿富汗政府致力于同其他国家在互相尊重、维护和保卫世界和平的基础上加强友好关系。巩固中东安全是阿富汗的主要愿望。
    达乌德接着说，同邻国发展和保持友好关系的情况是令人满意的。巴基斯坦是阿富汗还没有能够同它解决政治分歧的唯一的一个国家。达乌德说，巴基斯坦在普什图尼斯坦问题上的政策是发生这些分歧的唯一原因。
    他接着指出，阿富汗既然注意到必须维护和平和安全，所以从来没有错过任何机会争取来同巴基斯坦政府协商解决普什图尼斯坦问题。阿富汗认为，普什图尼斯坦问题的解决是维护这个地区的和平和安全所必要的。
