Members of the Sino-Albanian Friendship Collective Farm
Reporting to the Albanian People on the Establishment of the Farm

Respected Comrade Hoxha:

With great excitement, we report to you and the Albanian people a joyous event: at the end of January this year, we established a collective farm. To commemorate and promote the friendship between the Chinese and Albanian people, our farm is named the "Sino-Albanian Friendship" Farm.

Before liberation, we lived in poverty under the cruel exploitation of landlords. After liberation, land reform gave us houses and land, and the Party and government provided active guidance and assistance to our production. Therefore, our production increased and our lives improved. However, at this time, we were still producing on a household-by-household basis, so there was a limit to increasing output and income.

In the autumn of 1953, 14 peasant households, including poor peasant Hou Shuli of Xialiu Village, formed the "May 3rd Agricultural Production Cooperative" on the basis of mutual aid teams, according to the Party's instructions. Although this cooperative was of a semi-socialist nature, it showed great superiority in all aspects after its establishment. In the summer of 1954, the cooperative's wheat yield increased by 30% compared to before its establishment; the income of the members generally increased: the income of poor peasant Zhao Bangzhao more than doubled, and 4 of the original 5 grain-deficient households became surplus-grain households. In the autumn of the same year, the cooperative achieved increased production of corn, beans, and other crops, and sold 40% more grain to the state than planned. As a result, this agricultural production cooperative became the direction of advancement for the peasants throughout the township.

At this time, we began to establish regular contact with the Albanian people. The Albanian Embassy in our country constantly sent us books, periodicals, and pictorials introducing the Albanian people's experience in building socialism and the improvement of the living standards of the working people. This gave us great encouragement and strengthened our confidence in taking the socialist road.

In the autumn of 1954, we had 4 agricultural production cooperatives in our township, with a total of 96 member households; in 1955, the number of agricultural production cooperatives increased to 26, with 866 member households, accounting for 76.3% of the total number of households in the township. This year, inspired by the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) for 1956-1967 proposed by the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, in order to further develop production and strive for an early arrival of a happy and prosperous socialist society, 1,110 households and 4,465 peasants in the township voluntarily organized a collective farm. This is a great achievement we have made in advancing towards socialism. We will give full play to the power of the collective and implement the policy of diligence and thrift in managing the farm, so that our collective farm can exert more superiority in production.

Dear Comrade Enver Hoxha, Albania and China, together with other fraternal countries, are advancing on the road of socialist construction. We are all peace-loving countries, because we deeply realize that only peace can enable us to build a socialist society smoothly and live a happier life. However, there are still some imperialist elements who are trying to create wars and disrupt our peaceful life. We believe that the strength of the peace-loving people of the world will surely shatter their evil attempts. Let the people of China and Albania unite more closely, strengthen our friendship, and play a greater role in the struggle to prevent a new war.

Long live Sino-Albanian friendship!

### 中阿友好集体农庄庄员  向阿尔巴尼亚人民报告建庄经过

    中阿友好集体农庄庄员
    向阿尔巴尼亚人民报告建庄经过敬爱的霍查同志：
    我们怀着十分兴奋的心情，向您和阿尔巴尼亚人民报告一件喜事：今年1月底，我们建立了集体农庄。为了纪念和促进中阿两国人民之间的友谊，我们的农庄定名为“中阿友好”农庄。
    解放以前，我们在地主的残酷剥削下，过着贫困的生活。解放以后，土地改革使我们有了房屋和土地，党和政府对我们的生产又给以积极的指导和扶助，因此我们的生产提高了，生活也得到了改善。可是这个时候，我们还是一家一户地进行生产，因此增加产量和增加收入也就有了一定的限度。
    1953年秋天，下柳村贫农侯树立等14户农民，根据党的指示，在互助组的基础上，组成了“五三农业生产合作社”。这个合作社虽然是半社会主义性质的，可是建成之后就在各方面显示了很大的优越性。1954年夏季，全社小麦比建社以前增产30％；社员的收入普遍增加了：贫农赵邦照的收入比过去增加了一倍半，原来的5户缺粮户已经有4户变成了余粮户。当年秋季，全社玉米、豆类等作物又获得了增产，社里出卖给国家的粮食比预定计划超过40％。由于这样，这个农业生产合作社就成为全乡农民前进的方向。
    就在这个时候，我们开始同阿尔巴尼亚人民建立了经常的联系。阿尔巴尼亚驻我国大使馆不断给我们寄来书刊、画报，介绍阿尔巴尼亚人民建设社会主义的经验和劳动人民生活改善的情况。这给我们很大的鼓舞，使我们坚定了走向社会主义道路的信心。
    1954年秋天，我们全乡有了4个农业生产合作社，入社农户共96户；1955年，农业生产合作社发展到26个，入社农户达到866户，占全乡总农户76.3％。今年，在中共中央政治局提出的1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）的鼓舞下，为了进一步发展生产，争取美满幸福的社会主义社会早日到来，全乡1，110户、4，465个农民自愿组织了集体农庄。这是我们在向社会主义前进中所取得的一个巨大成就。我们将充分发挥集体的力量，贯彻勤俭经营的方针，使我们的集体农庄在生产中发挥更多的优越性。
    亲爱的恩维尔·霍查同志，阿尔巴尼亚和中国，同其他兄弟国家一起，正在社会主义建设的道路上迈进。我们都是热爱和平的国家，因为我们深切地体会到：只有和平，才能使我们顺利地建设社会主义社会，才能使我们生活得更幸福。但是，还有一些帝国主义分子，他们企图制造战争，破坏我们的和平生活。我们相信，全世界和平人民的力量，必将粉碎他们这种罪恶的企图。让我们中阿两国人民更加亲密地团结起来，加强我们的友谊，在制止新战争的斗争中发挥更大的力量。
    中阿友好万岁！
