    An Advanced Female Workers' Group
    Mao Xianzhi
    In an inconspicuous corner of the steel casting workshop of the Dalian Shipyard, a female workers' group consisting of 12 female workers has been working diligently year after year. In January of this year, they completed the workload for the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and now they are already engaged in production for 1958.
    When this female workers' group was first established in October 1954, the first difficulty they encountered was their low technical skills. In the past, they only acted as assistants to male workers in various processes. After the establishment of the female workers' group, they were required to take full responsibility for all three processes of punching anchor chain links. Due to their low technical skills, the group's daily output was initially only half that of male workers. When it was time to get off work, some male workers would come over after washing their hands to take a peek and jokingly ask, "Did you surpass us today!" The female workers were very embarrassed and had to reply, "Yes, we surpassed you!" From the helpless answers of the female workers, one could understand how anxious they were in their hearts.
    After the workshop leaders discovered this situation, they decided to ask the section chiefs to give the female workers more help. At that time, Zou Gaoyun, Dai Guangke, and Sun Xucan, three section chiefs, took turns leading the day and night three-shift production. When it was their turn to work the day shift, they used their main strength to take care of the production of the female workers' group. The section chiefs found that the female workers did not have a fixed labor organization. After starting work every day, the group leader temporarily assigned work, so production was very chaotic. Therefore, they convened a meeting to study a fixed labor organization, assigning fixed work to those who were suitable for it. In this way, not only were everyone's strengths brought into play, but also because the work was fixed, the female workers could go to work early to prepare for production, avoiding the temporary assignment of tasks during production time.
    After a few days, the female workers' operations began to become skilled, and the output also increased from 3 frames to 4 or 5 frames per day. However, they still couldn't catch up with the male workers; more importantly, the quality was low and there were many defective products. Most of the defective products were produced in the "matching mold halves" process. The workers who punched the rings punched the sand mold well, the workers who brushed the lead powder brushed the lead powder on, but they would ruin it when they matched the mold halves! Everyone was very sad. Once, group leader Guo Lianying pointed to Liu Lanyu and asked, "Why are your eyes so red?" Liu Lanyu replied, "Your eyes are also very red!" So they talked to each other about not being able to sleep at night because of the many defective products. Liu Lanyu asked Guo Lianying very depressingly: "Why do we always ruin the matching of mold halves?" In fact, Guo Lianying was also very anxious about this matter, but she was the group leader, so she had to cheer up and encourage the group members. She said to Liu Lanyu: "Don't be discouraged, work hard, use your brains more, be more careful, and the quality will improve!" Liu Lanyu had heard these words so many times that she returned to her work table without any energy to work. At this time, she recalled some past events. She remembered that when she used to work with male workers, Liu Tiancai, a master craftsman who created the advanced mold matching method, wanted to teach her technical skills. When things were busy, Master Liu would call her over: "Come down and try a couple! Learn a little!" But at that time, Liu Lanyu always tilted her head and smiled and said, "This is the work of master craftsmen, we dare not do it." When Liu Lanyu thought of this, she regretted it very much. She blamed herself for not learning it well at that time. After regretting it, she thought that it was not too late to learn well from now on. As soon as this idea arose, it was like a blind person opened his eyes, saw the road ahead clearly, increased his strength, and worked energetically.
    At this time, the workshop Party branch discovered that the female workers had a depressed mood, so it decided to have Guo Caichuan, a member of the branch committee and chairman of the workshop trade union, come to encourage them. At the same time, technician Deng Yongchun was also sent to help the female workers' group. The female workers' production enthusiasm gradually stabilized and their confidence also increased.
    One morning, the quality inspectors ran to the female workers and said, "There are a lot of defective products again, you have to be careful!" But in which link did the defective products occur? Liu Dezhi, the trade union group leader, became anxious and notified everyone to hold a trade union group meeting during the lunch break to study ways to eliminate defective products. This meeting determined that in order to eliminate defective products, first of all, the reasons must be given when defective products appear, and the person responsible must be found. So they selected people in the group to be responsible for inspecting semi-finished products; the sand molds punched out by the ring punching workers must be inspected, and those that do not meet the specifications will not be sent for mold matching. And everyone's work must be numbered, so that the person responsible can be found for defective products. After these systems were established, everyone's sense of responsibility became stronger. From then on, every morning before going to work, the female workers would run to the mold closing workers (the next process) to solicit opinions and find out if there were any problems with their work, so as to improve it. Later, they elected Ma Ziyu to be responsible for inspecting the sand mud and Wang Fuzhen to manage the models. Now, this female workers' group holds a 10-minute meeting after work every day to check the production situation of the day and exchange experiences. The female workers' group thus earnestly searched for the causes of defective products and tried to block the loopholes of defective products in many ways. Therefore, the defective product rate gradually went from more than 20% in the past to nearly eliminating defective products.
    Quality has improved, and output must also be improved. The most important reason for this group's increase in output is the study of the multi-cavity molding method. In the past, when workers punched rings, regardless of whether they were large or small rings, they all used single-cavity molding. After the establishment of the female workers' group, the workshop proposed to adopt the advanced method of multi-cavity molding. In the past, single-cavity molding could only produce a sand mold of half a ring at a time, while multi-cavity molding could produce sand molds of two halves of rings at a time, greatly improving production efficiency. After the female workers mastered this advanced molding method, they became as active as dragons in water. At first, they only dared to use multi-cavity molding on 25 mm rings, but the more they did it, the bolder they became, and they also used multi-cavity molding for 28 mm and 30 mm rings. Recently, they have also successfully studied the use of multi-cavity molding for 34 mm rings. This has further expanded the scope of application of this advanced experience, and production efficiency has also been rapidly improved. In the past, using single-cavity molding for 34 mm anchor chain links could only produce 1.5 links a day, but now using multi-cavity molding, 3 links can be produced a day. Therefore, although the production quota of the female workers' group was increased by 38% last year, they were able to over fulfill the task every month.
    The female workers' group could only produce 3 or 4 frames of work a day, but later gradually increased to 9 frames. Now they have set a competition condition to guarantee 10 frames a day. In terms of quality, the competition target they set is to reach 98% quality.

    一个先进的女工小组
    毛先智
    在大连造船公司铸钢车间的一个不引人注意的角落里，一个由12名女工组成的女工小组成年地在这里勤勤恳恳地劳动着。她们在今年1月份提早完成了小组第一个五年计划期间的工作量，现在，她们已经在进行1958年的生产。
    这个女工小组在1954年10月刚刚成立的时候，首先遇到的困难是技术太低。她们过去在各个工序中只是给男工当配手，在成立女工小组以后，就要求她们负起冲锚链环的3道工序的全部工作。由于技术低，小组的日产量最初只抵上男工的一半。到下班的时候，有的男工洗完手跑来溜一溜，逗趣地问道：“今天又超过啦！”女工们很不好意思，只好顺着说：“嗯，超过啦！”从女工们无可奈何的答话里可以了解到：她们的内心是多么焦急。
    车间领导上发现这种情况以后，决定要工段长多给女工一些帮助。当时有邹告运、戴广科、孙绪灿3个工段长轮流领导日夜三班的生产。他们轮到白班值日的时候，都用主要力量来照顾女工小组的生产。工段长发现女工干活没有固定的劳动组织，每天上班以后组长临时分配工作，因此生产很乱。于是便召集她们开会，研究固定劳动组织，谁适宜做什么活，就分配固定的工作。这样一来，不但发挥了大家的专长，而且由于工作固定，女工们可以提前上班作好生产前的准备，免得在生产时间临时分配任务。
    过了些日子，女工们操作开始熟练了，产量也从每天3架提高到4架5架。但是仍然赶不上男工；更重要的是质量低，废品多。废品多是出在“对箱”这道工序上。冲环的工人把砂型冲好，刷铅粉的工人刷上铅粉，拿来一对箱就对坏了！大家都很难过。一次组长郭莲英指着柳兰玉问道：“你的眼睛怎么这样红？”柳兰玉回答说：“你的眼睛也红得很呀！”于是她们互相谈起因为废品多，晚上睡不着觉的事情来了。柳兰玉很苦闷地问郭莲英：“为什么我们对箱老坏呢？”其实郭莲英也为这事急得够受了，但是她是组长，还得打起精神来鼓励组员。她对柳兰玉说：“不要灰心，好好干吧，多动点脑筋，仔细一些，质量会提高的！”柳兰玉已经听熟这些话了，回到自己的工作案子跟前，也没有精神干活，这时她回想起一些往事。她记起过去和男工一起干活的时候，先进对箱法创造者刘天才老师傅曾经想教她学技术，在活忙的时候，刘师傅就招呼她：“下来干两个试试吧！学一学！”可是那时柳兰玉总是把头一歪，笑笑说：“这是老师傅干的活，我们不敢干。”柳兰玉想到这里，后悔极了，她埋怨自己当时为什么不好好学一下。后悔之余，她又想到，从现在起好好学，也还是来得及的。这个念头一产生，就像瞎子睁开了眼睛，看清了前进的道路，身上增加了力量，干活有劲了。
    正在这时候，车间党支部发觉女工有苦闷情绪，便决定由支部委员、车间工会主席郭财传来鼓励她们。同时还派了技师邓永春对女工小组进行帮助。女工们的生产情绪逐渐稳定下来，信心也增加了。
    一天早晨，质量检查人员跑来对女工们说：“又出了不少废品，你们得小心一些呀！”可是废品出在哪个环节上呢？工会组长刘德枝着了急，就通知大家在中午休息的时候开工会小组会，研究消灭废品的办法。这次会上确定，要消灭废品，首先要在出了废品的时候能够提出原因来，而且要找出负责人来。于是她们就在小组里选出人来负责检查半成品；冲环工人冲出来的砂型，都要经过检查，不合规格的就不送去对箱。并且每个人做的活都要编上号，废品可以找出负责人来。这些制度订出来以后，大家的责任心更强了。以后每天早晨还没上班，女工们就跑到盖箱工人（下道工序）那里去征求意见，了解自己做的活有毛病没有，以便改进。以后她们又推选马子玉负责检查砂泥，王福珍管理模型。现在这个女工小组每天下班以后开10分钟的会，检查当天的生产情况，交流经验。女工小组就这样认真寻找出废品的原因，多方面想办法来堵塞出废品的漏洞，因此从过去20％多的废品率，逐渐做到接近消灭废品。
    质量提高了，产量也要提高。这个小组提高产量的最重要的原因，是学习了连胎造型法。过去工人冲环的时候，不论大环小环，一律用单胎造型。女工小组成立以后，车间提出要采用连胎造型的先进方法。过去单胎造型，一次只能打出半个环的砂型，而连胎造型一次能做出两个半环的砂型，生产效率提高很多。女工们掌握了这一先进造型法以后，像蛟龙得水一般的活跃起来了。开头她们只敢在25粍的环上使用连胎造型，后来越干越胆大，28粍、30粍的环也用连胎造型。最近她们又研究成功做34粍的环也用连胎造型。这使得这一先进经验的使用范围更加扩大了，生产效率也迅速地提高了。34粍的锚链环过去用单胎造型，一天只能做1根半，现在用连胎造型，一天能做出3根。因此去年女工小组的生产定额虽然提高了38％，但是每个月都能超额完成任务。
    女工小组原来一天只能出3架、4架活，后来逐渐提高到9架。现在她们订的竞赛条件保证每天出10架。在质量方面她们订的竞赛指标，质量是要达到98％。
