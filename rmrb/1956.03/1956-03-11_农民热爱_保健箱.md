To the Editor:

    The Hebei Provincial Pharmaceutical Company system has been carrying out the work of bringing prepared medicines to the countryside, supplying a large number of "healthcare kits" suitable for rural needs. The peasant masses generally feel that these kits "save money, save trouble, and do not delay work," and warmly welcome this approach.

    Gao Yuting, the production leader of the "Five-Five" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiaozhuang, a suburb of Baoding City, suffered from "acute conjunctivitis" and was in constant pain. He used the "eye drops" in the healthcare kit, and his eye disease was cured after only a few applications. Liu Lianbao, the deputy director of the Qunli Agricultural Production Cooperative in the same township, had a severe toothache and could not even attend the cooperative's meetings. After using the "toothache medicine" from the healthcare kit, his toothache stopped. Zhang Lanxin, a member of the Fengshou Agricultural Production Cooperative in Changwang Township, Wan County, accidentally cut her hand while cutting cabbage in the field. The health worker immediately applied "iodine," and the wound healed quickly. Xiao Baozhen, a single farmer in the first village of Kuaizizhuang, Fengrun County, had a stomachache one day. Director Zhao of the village's agricultural production cooperative gave him painkiller pills, and he quickly recovered. Later, he learned that the medicine was delivered to the cooperative by the pharmaceutical company, and he said with emotion: "There are so many benefits to joining the cooperative! I must apply to join the cooperative..." Now he is already a member of the agricultural production cooperative.

    From late November 1955 to January 5, 1956, 2,962 "healthcare kits" have been established in Hebei Province. With the establishment of "healthcare kits," the situation of medicine shortages in rural areas will be gradually changed.

    农民热爱“保健箱”编辑同志：
    河北省医药公司系统开展了成药下乡工作，大量供应适合农村需要的“保健箱”。农民群众普遍感到治病“省钱、省事、不误工”，热烈欢迎这种做法。
    保定市郊区焦庄“五五”农业生产合作社生产股长高玉廷患“暴发性火眼病”，终日疼痛难忍；他就使用了保健箱里的“眼药水”，只点几次眼病就好了。这个乡的群力农业生产社副社长刘连保牙疼的厉害，社里的会议也不能参加；他用了保健箱里的“牙疼水”后，牙疼就停止了。完县常望乡丰收农业生产合作社社员张兰新在地里砍白菜的时候，一不小心把手碰破了，保健员马上给擦了“碘酒”，伤口很快就好了。丰润县侉子庄第一村单干农民萧宝珍有一天肚子疼，村里农业生产合作社赵主任给他服了止痛片，病很快就好了；后来他知道了这种药是医药公司送到社里来的，就感动地说：“入社的好处这样多啊，我一定要申请入社……。”现在他已经是农业生产合作社的社员了。
    从1955年11月下旬到1956年1月5日，河北全省已经建立了2，962个“保健箱”；随着“保健箱”的建立，农村缺医少药的情况将会逐步得到改变。　                河北省医药公司　单鸿权
