To our dear young comrades in industry and commerce across the country:

We, over 800 young industrialists and businessmen, have accepted your entrustment and come to Beijing, the capital of our great motherland, to attend the National Congress of Young Activists from Industry and Commerce with honor. At this conference, we listened to the instructions of central leaders and the reports of leading comrades from the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and the All-China Youth Federation. We further recognized the brilliant and splendid prospects of our motherland and the glorious responsibility of our young people in industry and commerce in the great socialist transformation. What moved us especially was that on the day before the closing of the conference, our beloved leader Chairman Mao Zedong personally received us and took a photo with us. The delegates from all over the country who attended the conference were deeply moved by the cordial care of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong. Now that the conference is about to come to a victorious conclusion, we would like to say a few words to the young comrades in industry and commerce across the country with great excitement before returning to our jobs.

Currently, our motherland is in the midst of a great upsurge of socialist revolution, and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce has achieved decisive victories. Driven by the great upsurge of socialist revolution, the face of our country has undergone fundamental changes. We can fully believe that in a not-too-long period, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and through the joint efforts of the people of our country, our motherland will be built into a great industrialized country with a high degree of modern culture.

The conference profoundly educated us and made us see the future of our young people in industry and commerce more clearly than ever before. We must consciously grasp our own destiny and closely integrate our personal future with the future of the motherland. Thousands of rivers flow into the sea, and all roads lead to communism. This is the inevitable law of social development. Especially in the era of the leap forward in our country's socialist cause, we must not have the slightest hesitation or doubt. Some people regret their poor background, which is unnecessary. Some people feel that their future is bleak, which is unfounded. We are still young. Young people's eyes should look forward. Our life is only just beginning, and we will have most of our lives to spend in socialist society. The road ahead of us is still very wide. As long as we move forward with the motherland, there is no doubt that we will all have a bright and splendid future.

To move forward with the motherland means that, on the one hand, we must fundamentally transform our enterprises, replace capitalist private ownership with socialist public ownership, and replace capitalist management methods with socialist management methods; on the other hand, we ourselves must thoroughly abandon the bourgeois ideology and style in the process of enterprise transformation and transform ourselves into self-reliant labor citizens of socialist society.

At present, the fundamental transformation of enterprises is only just beginning. We young people in industry and commerce are all staff members of joint ventures and are very familiar with the situation of the original enterprises. Therefore, we should take greater responsibility for the operation and management of the enterprises after joint management. Some people think that the enterprises have been jointly managed and are controlled by the state, so they passively wait for the state representatives to go to the factory, shirk their responsibilities, relax their efforts, and are afraid to work boldly. All of this is wrong. Our 800 representatives are willing to encourage each other with young people in industry and commerce across the country in future production and operation. We must accept the leadership of the state representatives, accept the supervision and help of the workers, strive to learn advanced experience, diligently study our business, improve our skills, establish new systems and new styles, and we will unreservedly dedicate all our useful experience to our new enterprises.

We must work hard to study and transform ourselves, study current affairs and policies, improve our socialist consciousness, study Marxism-Leninism, and gradually overcome the various bourgeois thoughts and styles that we have been contaminated with for a long time. Some of us originally held the idea that "we are young and easy to transform, so we don't need to work hard." After the discussion at the conference, we have realized that this idea is wrong. People with this idea will inevitably relax their efforts to transform themselves. Ideological transformation is a long-term, sharp, complex, and repeated struggle between new and old ideas. Although we are relatively young, we have lived a parasitic life for many years, taking tea when it comes and opening our mouths for food. We have received bourgeois education and have actually participated in several years of exploitation. We have not experienced the preciousness of labor, so the exploitative class consciousness is serious in our minds. Although we have overcome a lot through study, self-transformation, and criticism in the years since liberation, we have not yet removed the root. The purpose of self-transformation is not only to abandon exploitation in action, but also to transform ourselves ideologically into a member of the working class with socialist thought. Ideological transformation is by no means something that can be accomplished overnight, but requires us to make long-term and solid efforts. We are willing to work together with young comrades in industry and commerce across the country to transform ourselves into glorious laborers with certain labor skills and a certain degree of socialist consciousness through study and labor.

We must unite with people in the same industry and trade with a modest and sincere attitude, and influence them with our own exemplary actions of actively accepting transformation, help others to dispel their concerns, improve their understanding, and consciously accept transformation together. We must repeatedly explain the principles and policies to our fathers, brothers, and relatives, so that they understand that only by taking the socialist road can we have a bright future and benefit our descendants. As for some children of industrialists and businessmen who are not in enterprises but are studying or working in other units, we also hope that they must work and study hard with creative labor, actively participate in social welfare activities, and enthusiastically help and encourage their fathers, brothers, and relatives to transform their thinking.

Comrades, we young people in industry and commerce must work hard to transform ourselves, strengthen unity, learn our skills well, and build socialism together with the people of the whole country. We firmly believe that we will never fail to live up to the kind teachings and earnest expectations of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. We must not only be activists in socialist transformation, but also strive to become activists in socialist construction.

Comrades, we are all Chinese youth growing up in the great era of Mao Zedong. We have the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party, the education and help of the Communist Youth League and the All-China Youth Federation, the encouragement and support of the people of the whole country, and we ourselves have a strong desire to make progress. We will certainly be able to overcome any difficulties on the road ahead and build our country into a prosperous and strong socialist country together with the people of the whole country.

Finally, let us shout:
Long live our great motherland!
Long live the great Chinese Communist Party!
Long live our beloved leader and teacher Chairman Mao!

    全国工商界青年积极分子大会
    致全国工商界青年的一封信亲爱的全国工商界青年同志们：
    我们800多个青年工商业者，接受了你们的委托，来到我们伟大祖国的首都北京，光荣地出席了全国工商界青年积极分子大会。在这次大会上，我们听取了中央领导同志的指示，和团中央、全国青联负责同志的报告，进一步认识到我们祖国的光辉灿烂的远景，和我们工商界青年在伟大社会主义改造事业中的光荣责任。尤其使我们感动的是，在大会闭幕的前一天，我们敬爱的领袖毛泽东主席亲自接见了我们，和我们一起照了相。我们出席大会的各地代表，为中国共产党和毛泽东主席的亲切关怀所深深感动，现在大会就要胜利地闭幕了，在回到自己的工作岗位以前，我们怀着万分激动的心情，向全国工商界青年同志们说几句话。
    目前我们的祖国正处在伟大的社会主义革命高潮中，农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造都已经取得了决定意义的胜利。在伟大的社会主义革命高潮的推动下，我们国家的面貌已经发生了根本的变化。我们完全可以相信，在一个不很长的时期内，在中国共产党的领导下，经过我国人民的共同努力，把我们的祖国建设成为一个工业化的具有高度现代文化程度的伟大的国家。
    大会深刻地教育了我们，使我们比过去任何时候都更加看清了我们工商界青年的前途。我们必须自觉地掌握自己的命运，把个人前途同祖国的前途紧密地结合起来。千条河流归大海，条条道路通向共产主义，这是社会发展的必然规律。尤其在我国社会主义事业飞跃前进的时代里，我们更不能有丝毫的徘徊和犹豫。有人悔恨自己的出身不好，这是不必要的。有人感到自己的前途渺茫，这是没有根据的。我们现在还都是青年。青年人的眼睛应当向前看。我们的生活才仅是开始，我们一生还将要有大半的时光要在社会主义社会里渡过，摆在我们面前的道路还宽广得很。只要我们跟着祖国一道前进，毫无疑问，就都会有光明灿烂的远大前程。
    跟祖国一道前进，这就是说，一方面，要根本改造我们的企业，用社会主义的全民所有制代替资本主义的私有制，用社会主义的经营管理方法去代替资本主义的经营管理方法；另一方面，我们自己也要在企业的改造过程中，彻底抛弃资产阶级思想作风，把自己改造成为自食其力的社会主义社会的劳动公民。
    现在，企业的根本改造工作，还仅在开始。我们工商界青年，都是合营企业的工作人员，又都对原来企业的情况十分熟悉，那么，在合营后企业的经营和管理上，就应当负起更大的责任。有人认为，企业合营了，由国家掌握了，于是产生了消极等待公股代表下厂，推卸自己的责任，放松自己的努力，缩手缩脚，不去大胆地进行工作，这都是不对的。我们800多个代表，愿意在今后的生产经营工作上，和全国工商青年互勉互励。我们一定要很好接受公股代表领导，接受工人的监督和帮助，努力学习先进经验，认真钻研业务，提高技术，树立新制度、新作风，原来一切有用的经验，我们将毫无保留地献给我们的新企业。
    我们一定要努力学习改造自己，学习时事政策，提高社会主义觉悟，学习马克思列宁主义，逐步克服掉长期沾染的各种资产阶级思想和作风。我们中间的一些人原来抱着一种“自己年轻容易改造，不需要艰苦努力”的想法。经过大会的讨论，我们已经认识到这种想法是不对的。有着这种想法的人，必然会放松对自己改造的努力。思想改造是一个长期的尖锐、复杂、反复的新旧思想的斗争过程。我们虽然比较年轻，但是多少年来过着茶来到手、饭来开口的寄生生活，受的是资产阶级的教育，又实际参加了几年的剥削生活，没有体验过劳动的可贵，因此剥削阶级意识在脑子里是严重的，解放以后的几年来虽然经过学习，自我改造和批判，克服了不少，但仍然还没有把根子拔掉。自我改造的目的不但是要在行动上放弃剥削，而且要求在思想上改造成为具有社会主义思想的工人阶级的一个成员。思想改造就决不是一朝一夕所能完成的事，而必需要我们作长期的扎扎实实的努力。我们愿意和全国工商界青年同志们共同努力，通过学习，通过劳动，把自己改造成为一个具有一定劳动技能，又具有一定的社会主义觉悟的光荣的劳动者。
    我们一定要以虚心诚恳的态度去团结同行同业的人，并且以自己积极接受改造的模范行动去影响他们，帮助别人解除顾虑，提高认识，一同自觉地接受改造。我们要反复地向自己的父兄和亲友说明道理，讲清政策，使他们懂得只有走社会主义道路，才能有光明前途，才能造福子孙。至于有些不在企业而在别的单位学习或工作的工商界的子女们，我们也希望他们，一定要以创造性的劳动努力工作和学习，积极参加社会公益活动，热情地帮助和鼓励自己的父兄和亲友改造思想。
    同志们，我们工商界青年一定要努力改造，加强团结，学好本领，和全国人民一道建设社会主义。我们坚信，我们大家决不会辜负党中央和毛主席的亲切教导和殷切期望，我们不仅要做社会主义改造的积极分子，而且要争取成为社会主义建设的积极分子。
    同志们，我们都是生长在伟大的毛泽东时代的中国青年，我们有着伟大的中国共产党的领导，有着青年团和青联对我们的教育和帮助，有着全国人民对我们的鼓励和支持，我们自己也都具有要求进步的热烈愿望，我们一定能够克服前进道路上的任何困难，同全国人民一起把我们的祖国建设成为一个繁荣昌盛的社会主义国家。
    最后让我们高呼：
    我们伟大的祖国万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    我们敬爱的领袖和导师毛主席万岁！
    全国工商界青年积极分子大会
                1956年2月29日
