    Harbin Flax Textile Factory
    A Large Number of Female Advanced Producers Emerge
    A total of 150 female advanced producers and 10 model workers have emerged from the Harbin Flax Textile Factory. Fifteen female workers have been promoted to deputy directors or deputy foremen of workshops. They have all contributed greatly on the production front. Female worker Liu Chunhua can operate 12 automatic looms alone and overfulfills her tasks every month. She is now working on her July 1957 workload. Although Chen Xiujuan is already a mother of four, she has persisted in not being absent from work for four years and takes good care of her family and children.

    哈尔滨亚麻纺织厂
    涌现大批女先进生产者
    哈尔滨亚麻纺织厂涌现出150名女先进生产者和10名劳动模范，有15名女工被提拔为车间副主任或副工长。她们在生产战线上都贡献出了很大力量。女工刘春花一个人能操纵12台自动织布机，月月超额完成任务，现在她正在做1957年7月份的工作。陈秀绢虽然已是4个孩子的母亲，她4年坚持不缺勤，而且把家庭和孩子照顾得很好。
