    Today is the 35th anniversary of the founding of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party. The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, guided by Marxism-Leninism and influenced by the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution, was founded by the outstanding sons of the Mongolian people, Sukhe-Bator and Choibalsan. Over the past 35 years, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party has traversed a glorious path. It led the Mongolian people to achieve a brilliant victory in the people's revolution, established the Mongolian People's Republic, consolidated the people's democratic system, and built a poor and backward Mongolia into an independent, free, and prosperous people's democratic country.
    Under the correct leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and with the fraternal assistance of the great Soviet Union, the national economy of the Mongolian People's Republic, especially the main sector of the Mongolian national economy, animal husbandry, has greatly developed, and other economic sectors are also constantly rising. Modern national industries have been established and are rapidly growing, and the ranks of the Mongolian working class are also growing day by day. The directives on the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of Mongolia, adopted by the 12th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party in 1954, are a great program for the Mongolian people to continue advancing along the socialist road. For more than a year, the Mongolian people have achieved brilliant successes in the struggle to realize this plan. In 1955, Mongolian animal husbandry was further developed, the socialist component in agriculture and animal husbandry greatly increased, and the total industrial output increased by 15.5% compared with 1954. With the rapid development of the national economy, the material well-being and cultural life of the Mongolian people are also constantly improving. At present, illiteracy has been basically eliminated nationwide, and almost all school-age children are enrolled in schools. In 1955, the number of experts trained by the state increased by nearly half compared with 1954. The rapid development of Mongolia's economy and culture shows that the Mongolian people will surely be able to victoriously build socialism.
    The government of the Mongolian People's Republic has always pursued a peaceful foreign policy. The contributions made by the Mongolian people during the anti-fascist war years and in the post-war struggle to safeguard peace have been universally praised by the people of all countries. The government of the Mongolian People's Republic supports the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. At present, the Mongolian People's Republic has established diplomatic relations with countries that possess more than half of the world's population, including world powers such as the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and India. Its international status is rising, and it will increasingly play an important role in international relations in the future. However, due to the long-term obstruction by the United States, the legitimate right of the Mongolian People's Republic to enter the United Nations is still being deprived. All those who cherish the United Nations Charter and are willing to promote international cooperation extend sympathy and support to the Mongolian People's Republic.
    The fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian people, built on the foundation of Marxism-Leninism, is extremely close and profound. The founding of the People's Republic of China has brought about a further significant development of this friendship. The Sino-Mongolian Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement signed in 1952 is of great significance for the consolidation and development of friendly cooperation between the two countries. In particular, the completion of the railway connecting China, Mongolia, and the Soviet Union and the commencement of international through transport will greatly promote the development of friendly relations among the three countries.
    As the Mongolian people celebrate the 35th anniversary of the birth of their glorious party, the Chinese people express their heartfelt congratulations to the fraternal Mongolian people. The Chinese people congratulate the Mongolian people on their more brilliant achievements in socialist construction and the cause of safeguarding peace under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party.

    蒙古人民革命党成立35周年
    今天是蒙古人民革命党成立35周年。蒙古人民革命党是以马克思列宁主义为指导，在伟大十月社会主义革命的胜利影响下，由蒙古人民优秀的儿子苏赫—巴托尔和乔巴山创建的。35年来，蒙古人民革命党走过了光荣的道路。它领导蒙古人民取得了人民革命的辉煌胜利，建立了蒙古人民共和国，巩固了人民民主制度，把贫穷落后的蒙古建设成一个独立、自由和繁荣的人民民主国家。
    在蒙古人民革命党的正确领导下和伟大的苏联兄弟般的援助下，蒙古人民共和国的国民经济，特别是蒙古国民经济的主要部门畜牧业有了巨大的发展，其他经济部门也在不断高涨，现代化的民族工业已经建立并且迅速成长，蒙古工人阶级的队伍也在日益壮大。1954年蒙古人民革命党第十二次代表大会通过的关于蒙古发展国民经济第二个五年计划的指示，是蒙古人民沿着社会主义道路继续前进的伟大纲领。一年多以来，蒙古人民在为实现这个计划的斗争中已经获得了光辉的成就。1955年蒙古畜牧业有了进一步的发展，农牧业中的社会主义成分大大地增长了，工业总产量也比1954年增加了15.5％。随着国民经济的迅速发展，蒙古人民的物质福利和文化生活也在不断地提高。目前，全国文盲已基本上消灭，学龄儿童几乎全部入学。1955年国家培养的专家比1954年增加将近一半。蒙古人民经济和文化的迅速发展说明，蒙古人民一定能够胜利地建设社会主义。
    蒙古人民共和国政府一向执行着和平外交政策。蒙古人民在反法西斯战争年代和在战后维护和平的斗争中所作的贡献，受到各国人民普遍赞扬。蒙古人民共和国政府支持和平共处五项原则。目前，蒙古人民共和国已经同拥有世界人口一半以上的国家建立了外交关系，其中包括苏联、中华人民共和国和印度这样的世界大国。它的国际地位日益提高，它今后将在国际关系中日益发挥重要的作用。然而，由于美国的长期阻挠，蒙古人民共和国进入联合国的合法权利至今仍被剥夺。一切珍视联合国宪章和愿意促进国际合作的人们，都对蒙古人民共和国寄予同情和支持。
    建立在马克思列宁主义基础上的中蒙两国人民的兄弟友谊是无比密切和深远的。中华人民共和国的成立，使这种友谊有了进一步的重大发展。1952年签订的中蒙经济及文化合作协定，对于两国友好合作的巩固和发展具有重大意义。特别是接连中、蒙、苏三国的铁路的建成和开始国际联运，将大大促进三国人民友好关系的发展。
    当蒙古人民庆祝自己光荣的党的诞生35周年的时候，中国人民对兄弟般的蒙古人民表示衷心的祝贺。中国人民祝贺蒙古人民在蒙古人民革命党领导下进行的社会主义建设和保卫和平事业中获得更加辉煌的成就。
