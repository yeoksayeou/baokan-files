    Hainan Island Spring Fishing Season Begins
    The fishermen of Hainan Island have begun their largest spring fishing season since liberation. Currently, over a thousand fishing boats are concentrated in the Yingge Sea area on the west coast alone, and they have begun deep-sea operations.
    Before the arrival of this year's spring fishing season, the state allocated 1.5 million yuan in fishery loans, and also added nine technical extension stations, two typhoon warning stations, and various maritime safety equipment. A production command center has also been established in the Changhua Port fishing ground, the largest on the west coast.
    In 1955, the island's fishermen caught a total of more than 1.32 million dan of fish, exceeding the highest pre-war annual output by 15%. In the first and second quarters of this year, the fishermen are expected to produce more than 200,000 dan of fish than in the same period last year.

    海南岛春季捕鱼开始
    海南岛的渔民已经开始了解放以来规模最大的一次春季捕鱼。目前，仅在西海岸英哥海一带就集中了上千艘渔船，并且开始进行深水作业。
    今年春汛到来以前，国家就拨下150万元的渔业贷款，同时增设了九个技术推广站、两个台风警报站和各种海上安全设备；在西海岸最大的昌化港渔场，还设立了生产指挥部。
    1955年全岛渔民共捕鱼132万多市担，超过战前最高年产量15％。今年第一、二季度，渔民们要比去年同期再多产鱼二十多万市担。
