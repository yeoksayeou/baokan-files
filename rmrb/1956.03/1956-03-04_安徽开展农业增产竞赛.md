Anhui Province Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference, convened in late February, responded to the initiative of national agricultural labor models Li Shunda and others, and launched a province-wide agricultural production increase competition. Among them, representatives of 8 agricultural production cooperatives proposed production increase targets and specific measures. Their production increase measures mainly focus on improving the utilization rate of labor and labor productivity, requiring each male full labor force to work at least 250 workdays per year, and the female full labor force to participate in productive labor for no less than 150 workdays per year. At the same time, they will mobilize all those who can do light labor to participate in suitable production. They will continue to expand the area of multiple cropping, switch to high-yield crops, build water conservancy projects, and implement the conversion of dry land to paddy fields to ensure that they are not affected by floods and droughts under normal circumstances. Fertilizer application will be increased by 50% to 100%. They will continue to improve production technology and overcome the habit of extensive cultivation. The agricultural labor model representatives of the province suggested that agricultural production cooperatives throughout the province also formulate advanced plans and production increase measures according to possible conditions, and increase the province's grain output from 22.7 billion jin last year to 27 billion jin to 30 billion jin.

    安徽开展农业增产竞赛
    2月下旬召开的安徽省农业劳动模范代表会议全体代表，响应全国农业劳动模范李顺达等的倡议，发起在全省开展农业增产竞赛运动。其中有8个农业生产合作社的代表提出了增产指标和具体措施。他们的增产措施，主要是提高劳动力的利用率和劳动生产率，要求每个男子全劳动力每年至少做250个工作日，女子全劳动力每年生产劳动的时间不少于150个工作日。同时，发动一切能做轻微劳动的人参加适宜的生产。他们将继续扩大复种面积，改种高产作物，兴修水利，实行旱地改水田，保证在一般情况下不受水旱灾害。施肥量要分别增加50％到一倍。他们将继续改进生产技术，克服粗放的耕作习惯。全省农业劳动模范代表，建议全省农业生产合作社，也都按照可能条件，订出先进计划和增产措施，把全省粮食产量，由去年的227亿斤，提高到270亿斤到300亿斤。（本报驻合肥记者）
