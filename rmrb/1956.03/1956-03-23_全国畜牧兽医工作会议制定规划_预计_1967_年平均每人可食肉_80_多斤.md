    National Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Work Conference Formulates Plan
    Projected Average Per Capita Meat Consumption of Over 80 Jin in 1967
    (Our newspaper reports) The Ministry of Agriculture convened the National Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Work Conference in Beijing from March 14th to 22nd. The conference studied and formulated a long-term plan for developing animal husbandry production over the next twelve years. It is projected that by 1967, the national average per capita annual consumption will be over 80 jin of meat, over 400 eggs, and one dairy cow for every 70 people, with significant increases in wool and leather as well.

    The conference also made specific arrangements for this year's animal husbandry and veterinary work: The production of large livestock such as horses and cattle should increase to over 92 million head, and sheep, goats, and pigs should increase to over 229 million head, with pigs accounting for over 130 million head. Once the pig breeding task for this year is achieved, the 1957 target set by the First Five-Year Plan can be reached ahead of schedule. The conference also requested that over 180,000 head of horses and cattle and 2.3 million sheep be improved through breeding with superior breeding stock this year.

    The conference believes that to realize the twelve-year long-term plan and complete this year's tasks, it is necessary to help agricultural production cooperatives diligently perform tasks such as livestock breeding, pregnancy protection, and calving, improve the survival rate of young livestock, and establish livestock feeding, utilization, and management systems; continue to vigorously open up feed sources, plant high-yield feed crops, and establish consolidated feed bases; accelerate the improvement of livestock breeds and develop state-owned farms; and also do a good job in veterinary epidemic prevention work, strengthen scientific and technological research in animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, and ensure that the most serious animal diseases such as rinderpest, hog cholera, Newcastle disease, porcine cysticercosis, bovine contagious pleuropneumonia, foot-and-mouth disease, sheep scabies, lamb dysentery, and equine glanders are basically eliminated within seven or twelve years.

    全国畜牧兽医工作会议制定规划
    预计1967年平均每人可食肉80多斤
    本报讯　农业部三月十四日到二十二日在北京召开全国畜牧兽医工作会议。会议研究制定了今后十二年发展畜牧业生产的远景规划。预计到1967年，全国每人每年平均可食肉八十多斤，蛋品四百多枚，每七十人可有一头奶牛，羊毛、皮革也可大大增加。
    会议对今年的畜牧兽医工作也作了具体安排：马、牛等大家畜的生产要增加到九千二百多万头，绵羊、山羊和猪要增加到二亿二千九百万多头，其中猪占一亿三千多万头。今年猪的增殖任务实现以后，就可以提前达到第一个五年计划规定的1957年的指标。会议还要求今年用优良种畜配种改良马、牛十八万多头，绵羊230万只。
    会议认为要实现十二年的远景规划和完成今年的任务，必须帮助农业生产合作社努力做好各种牲畜配种、保胎、产仔等工作，提高幼畜成活率和建立牲畜饲养、使役、管理制度；继续大力开辟饲料来源，种植高产饲料作物，建立巩固的饲料基地；加速改良畜种，发展国营牧场；还要做好兽疫防治工作，加强畜牧兽医科学技术研究工作，保证在七年或十二年内基本上消灭牛瘟、猪瘟、鸡新城疫、猪囊虫、牛肺疫、口蹄疫、羊疥癣、羔羊痢疾、马鼻疽等危害牲畜最严重的疫疾。
