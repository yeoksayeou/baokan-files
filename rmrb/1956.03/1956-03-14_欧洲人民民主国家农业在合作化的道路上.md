    European People's Democratic Countries on the Road to Agricultural Cooperativization
    Chen Wei
    The European People's Democratic Countries are now in a period of transition from capitalism to socialism. The main task of these countries during the transition period is to build the socialist economic base, that is, to realize socialist industrialization and complete the socialist transformation of agriculture. Agricultural cooperativization is the basic link in the socialist transformation of agriculture in the European People's Democratic Countries.
    Before liberation, with the exception of Czechoslovakia, the countries of Southeastern Europe were mostly agricultural countries. But even agriculture was very backward. Due to imperialist plunder and feudal landlord exploitation, the level of agricultural production was very low. Before the war, 44% of peasant households in Poland did not have draft horses, and in Bulgaria, before the war, an average of 57 households with less than 5 hectares of land had only one iron rake. Their average wheat yield per hectare in the five years before the war was half that of Germany. The agricultural production of other countries was also very low.
    After liberation, the European People's Democratic Countries successively carried out land reforms, distributing a total of about 14 million hectares of land to landless and land-poor peasants. Land reform abolished landlord exploitation, promoted the development of agricultural productive forces, and significantly improved the situation of working peasants. However, on the other hand, after land reform, land in the European People's Democratic Countries was also more fragmented than before. For example, in Romania, peasant households with less than 5 hectares of land accounted for only 28% of the country's cultivated land in 1930 before the war, but increased to more than 57% by 1948. In Bulgaria, at the end of 1946, the country's cultivated land had been divided into 12 million small plots, with an average of only 0.4 hectares per plot. Obviously, such small individual peasant economies do not have the strength to regularly achieve expanded reproduction. It cannot guarantee that the vast number of working peasants will escape poverty, cannot provide a large and increasing amount of commodity agricultural products to meet the needs of industrial development and people's lives, and cannot eradicate the phenomenon of polarization and ultimately and thoroughly eliminate capitalist elements in rural areas.
    Only by transforming the small individual peasant economy into large-scale socialist agriculture through the path of cooperativization can the contradiction between socialist large-scale industry and small peasant economy in the transition period be fundamentally resolved. Therefore, according to the theoretical guidance of Marxism-Leninism and the practical experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, the European People's Democratic Countries, while fully restoring the national economy and beginning to develop socialist industry, also regard carrying out the agricultural cooperativization movement as an important historical task.
    Due to different specific historical conditions, agricultural cooperativization in the European People's Democratic Countries also has different characteristics. The agricultural collectivization of the Soviet Union was carried out under the condition of land nationalization, and its main form was the agricultural labor association, that is, the collective farm. The European People's Democratic Countries implemented agricultural cooperativization while maintaining the private ownership of small peasant land, and did not universally adopt the form of agricultural labor associations with a completely socialist nature from the beginning, but used agricultural production cooperatives with a semi-socialist nature as the main form, in order to gradually transition from the lower to the higher stages. In addition, each country started agricultural cooperativization at different times and adopted different forms. Bulgaria had the first dozens of agricultural production cooperatives in the early days of liberation, while Romania, Poland, Czechoslovakia and other countries did not begin to establish the first batch of agricultural production cooperatives until 1948-1949. Some countries universally adopt a single form of agricultural production cooperative with a semi-socialist nature, such as Bulgaria; while others adopt multiple forms at the same time, such as Poland and Czechoslovakia.
    According to the ownership of land and means of production and the method of distributing labor fruits, agricultural production cooperatives in the European People's Democratic Countries can be roughly divided into three types. The first type is the communal farming cooperative. The land remains private, and only collective labor is carried out in plowing, sowing, weeding, harvesting, and other work, and the income belongs to each individual. This type of cooperative is low-level. The second type is the production cooperative. Land is used as shares, the means of production are collectively owned, labor is carried out collectively, and income is distributed according to labor days and the amount of land shares, and the latter part of the income does not exceed 15% to 20% of the total income. The third type is the agricultural labor association, which is equivalent to the collective farm in the Soviet Union and the advanced cooperative in our country. Here, the land is publicly owned, and income is distributed entirely according to the socialist principle of distribution according to labor. Among these types, agricultural production cooperatives with a semi-socialist nature are the most common.
    By the second half of 1955, the six People's Democratic Countries in Southeastern Europe had a total of more than 30,000 agricultural production cooperatives, with more than 1.6 million participating peasant households. Poland had a total of about 10,000 agricultural production cooperatives, with about 225,000 participating peasant households; Czechoslovakia had more than 6,700 cooperatives, with 260,000 peasant households; Hungary had 4,600, with 214,000 peasant households; Romania had more than 6,600, with more than 390,000 peasant households; Bulgaria had more than 2,700, with 600,000 peasant households; and Albania had 316, with more than 10,000 peasant households. Bulgaria had the most land owned by agricultural production cooperatives, accounting for more than 61% of the country's cultivated land. Czechoslovakia was second, accounting for about one-third, Hungary accounting for about 20%, Albania accounting for about 14%, and Poland and Romania accounting for about 10%.
    As a result of changing the production relations of individual private ownership, uniting the land, and carrying out collective management, agricultural production cooperatives in the European People's Democratic Countries have shown great superiority, and agricultural production has increased significantly. For example, the average harvest of wheat and barley per hectare in Romanian agricultural production cooperatives in 1955 was 20% to 40% more than that of individual peasants. Due to the continuous increase in yield per unit area and the increase in total harvest, agricultural production cooperatives are providing more and more commodity grains and other agricultural products. Now, agricultural production cooperatives in Bulgaria supply more than 60% of the country's grain, while Hungary and Czechoslovakia account for about one-third. Facts have proved that agricultural production cooperatives are the best form of combining the individual interests of peasants with the collective interests of socialist construction. It can not only promote the development of agricultural production, but also guarantee that the basic peasant masses universally live a prosperous and cultured life. Therefore, agricultural production cooperatives are attracting the attention of more and more individual peasants in the European People's Democratic Countries and are constantly expanding their membership. In this regard, the increasing number of middle peasants with a relatively stable economic foundation and rich production experience joining agricultural production cooperatives in recent years is the most powerful proof.
    The leadership of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the European People's Democratic Countries is an important factor in ensuring the smooth development of the agricultural cooperativization movement. They unswervingly followed the Marxist-Leninist guidelines on agricultural cooperativization, and resolutely fought against the "leftist" and rightist errors that had occurred in the process of the agricultural cooperativization movement. These errors were manifested on the one hand in blindly advancing, simply pursuing quantity, and not hesitating to replace the method of persuasion and education with coercive orders, thus rudely violating the principle of voluntariness; on the other hand, they were manifested in the harmful view of laissez-faire, which in fact amounted to denying the necessity of carrying out socialist transformation of agriculture. It is precisely because the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries have corrected and overcome these errors in a timely manner that the agricultural production cooperativization movement in the European People's Democratic Countries has been able to develop healthily and continuously.
    Firmly implementing the Party's class line of relying on the poor peasants, consolidating the unity of the middle peasants, and never stopping the struggle against the rich peasants is of great significance for expanding the socialist position in rural areas and consolidating the people's democratic system. Because many poor peasants have risen to become middle peasants, the middle peasants have now become the basic peasant masses in the European People's Democratic Countries, but the rich peasant economy still has a certain influence in rural areas today. As the last and most numerous exploiting class, the rich peasant class is unwilling to accept its final elimination and is carrying out fierce resistance and all kinds of sabotage activities against the cause of socialist transformation of agriculture. This determines the complexity and sharpness of the class struggle in rural areas of the European People's Democratic Countries. At present, the European People's Democratic Countries are implementing a strict policy of restricting and excluding rich peasants, and once the necessary political and economic prerequisites are met, they will transition to the stage of eliminating rich peasants.
    The working class and the people's regime of the European People's Democratic Countries constantly provide agricultural production cooperatives with multi-faceted assistance. This assistance includes: providing the services of agricultural machinery stations, giving preferential treatment in tax policies and the purchase price of agricultural products, reducing the amount of compulsory sales, providing credit loans, supplying a large amount of means of production and means of livelihood, helping to train cadres of cooperatives, and dispatching cadres to strengthen the leadership of cooperatives, and so on. These assistance have greatly consolidated agricultural production cooperatives and further strengthened the worker-peasant alliance, which is the foundation of the people's democratic system.
    The agricultural cooperativization movement in the European People's Democratic Countries for the past six or seven years has achieved great achievements. However, as the Communist and Workers' Parties of these countries have pointed out, there is still a considerable distance between agricultural cooperativization and the requirements of socialist construction. This distance is manifested in the fact that the industries of these countries have developed rapidly, and socialist ownership has an absolute advantage in the national economic sectors such as industry, transportation, and commerce, but agriculture is still significantly lagging behind the development of industry, and individual private ownership still accounts for a large proportion of agriculture today. Obviously, without fundamentally changing the backward production relations in agriculture, it is impossible to promote the rapid development of agricultural productive forces, and it will also affect the progress of the entire socialist construction.
    Therefore, after a period of consolidation for approximately two years, the parties and governments of the European People's Democratic Countries have now made plans to establish more new agricultural cooperatives while further strengthening existing agricultural production cooperatives, in order to promote the agricultural cooperativization movement more quickly and widely. For example, Hungary has proposed the task of making socialist components dominant in agriculture during the second five-year plan period, that is, before 1960. Recent news indicates that agricultural production cooperatives in various countries in Southeastern Europe have begun to develop vigorously since this year. There is no doubt that the great achievements of socialist industrialization in the European People's Democratic Countries, the solid foundation that the agricultural cooperativization movement has already laid, and the leadership of the parties and governments of these countries are reliable guarantees for the continued progress and final completion of agricultural cooperativization.

    欧洲人民民主国家农业在合作化的道路上
    陈维
    欧洲人民民主国家现在正处在从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期。这些国家过渡时期的主要任务是建设社会主义的经济基础，也就是实现社会主义工业化和完成对农业的社会主义改造，而农业合作化则是欧洲人民民主国家农业社会主义改造的基本环节。
    在解放以前，东南欧各国除捷克斯洛伐克外，大都是以农业为主的国家。但即使农业也是很落后的。由于帝国主义的掠夺和封建地主的剥削，农业生产水平十分低下。波兰战前全国有44％的农户没有耕马，保加利亚战前占有5公顷以下土地的农户平均每57家才有一把铁耙。它们战前五年中每公顷的小麦平均收获量要比德国少一半。其他各国的农业生产量也很低。
    解放以后，欧洲人民民主国家先后实行了土地改革，把总共约1，400万公顷的土地分配给了无地和少地的农民。土地改革废除了地主的剥削，促进了农业生产力的发展，同时显著地改善了劳动农民的处境。但是，另一方面，在土地改革以后，欧洲人民民主国家的土地也比从前分散了。例如，罗马尼亚护有5公顷以下土地的农户，在战前1930年只占有全国耕地的28％，而到1948年则增加到57％以上。在保加利亚，全国耕地在1946年底时已被分割成1，200万小块，平均每块只有0.4公顷。显然，这样细小的个体农民经济，是没有力量来经常实现扩大再生产的。它不能保证广大劳动农民摆脱贫困的境遇，不能提供大量的、日益增多的商品农产品来适应工业发展和人民生活的需要，同时也不能根除两极分化的现象和最后彻底消灭农村中的资本主义因素。
    只有通过合作化的道路把细小的个体农民经济改变成为大规模的社会主义农业，才能根本解决过渡时期中的社会主义大工业和小农经济之间的矛盾。因此，根据马克思列宁主义的理论指针和苏联建设社会主义的实际经验，欧洲人民民主国家在完全恢复国民经济、开始发展社会主义工业的同时，也把开展农业合作化运动作为重要的历史任务。
    由于具体的历史条件不同，欧洲人民民主国家的农业合作化也具有不同的特点。苏联的农业集体化是在土地国有化的条件下进行的，而且它的主要形式是农业劳动组合，即集体农庄。欧洲人民民主国家则在保持着小农土地私有制的条件下实行农业合作化，同时并不一开始就普遍采取完全社会主义性质的农业劳动组合的形式，而以半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社作为主要形式，以便由低级逐渐过渡到高级阶段。此外，每一个国家开始农业合作化的时间和采取的形式也有所不同。保加利亚在解放初期就有了最初的数十个农业生产合作社，而罗马尼亚、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克等国家则是到了1948—1949年才开始建立第一批农业生产合作社的。有的国家普遍采取单一的半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社形式，如保加利亚；而有的国家则同时采取多种的形式，如波兰、捷克斯洛伐克等。
    根据土地和生产资料的所有制情况和劳动果实分配的方式，欧洲人民民主国家的农业生产合作社大体上可以分为三种类型。第一类是共耕社。土地保持私有，只是在耕耘、播种、锄草、收割等工作上共同劳动，收益各归自己所得。这类合作社是低级的。第二类是生产合作社。土地入股，生产资料公有，共同劳动，收益按劳动日和入股土地的多少来分配，而后一部分的收入不超过收入总额的15％到20％。第三类是农业劳动组合，即相当于苏联的集体农庄和我国的高级社。这里土地公有，收益完全根据按劳取酬的社会主义原则进行分配。在这几种类型中，以半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社最为普遍。
    到1955年下半年为止，东南欧的六个人民民主国家总共已有约3万多个农业生产合作社，参加农户达160多万户。波兰全国共有约1万个农业生产合作社，参加农户约225，000；捷克斯洛伐克有合作社6，700多个，农户26万；匈牙利4，600个，农户214，000；罗马尼亚6，600多个，农户39万以上；保加利亚2，700多个，农户60万；阿尔巴尼亚316个，农户一万多。各国农业生产合作化所拥有的土地以保加利亚为最多，占全国耕地的61％以上。捷克斯洛伐克次之，约占三分之一，匈牙利约占20％，阿尔巴尼亚约占14％，波兰和罗马尼亚约占10％。
    由于改变了个体私有制的生产关系，联合了土地和进行集体经营的结果，欧洲人民民主国家的农业生产合作社已经显示出了很大的优越性，农业生产有了显著的增长。例如，罗马尼亚农业生产合作社每公顷小麦和大麦的平均收获量在1955年要比个体农民的多20％到40％。由于单位面积产量的不断提高和总收获量的增加，农业生产合作社所提供的商品谷物和其他农产品也愈来愈多了。现在保加利亚农业生产合作社供应的谷物已占全国的60％以上，匈牙利和捷克斯洛伐克占三分之一左右。事实证明，农业生产合作社是把农民的个人利益同社会主义建设的集体利益结合起来的最好形式。它不但能够促进农业生产的发展，而且也能保证基本农民群众普遍地过富裕的和有文化的生活。因此，农业生产合作社正在吸引着欧洲人民民主国家愈来愈多的个体农民的注意，并不断扩大它们的成员。在这方面，经济基础比较稳固并且具有丰富生产经验的中农近年来参加农业生产合作社的日益增多，就是最有力的说明。
    欧洲各人民民主国家的共产党和工人党的领导，是保证农业合作化运动顺利发展的重要因素。它们坚持不渝地遵循着马克思列宁主义关于农业合作化问题的方针，对曾经在农业合作化运动进程中出现过的“左”倾和右倾的错误进行了坚决的斗争。这种错误，一方面表现在盲目冒进、单纯追求数量，不惜以强迫命令的手段来代替说服教育的方法，因而粗暴地违反了自愿的原则；另一方面则表现在实际上等于否认必需对农业进行社会主义改造的放任自流的有害观点。正是由于各国共产党和工人党及时地纠正和克服了这些错误，欧洲人民民主国家的农业生产合作化运动才得以健康地和不断地发展。
    坚决地贯彻依靠贫农、巩固地团结中农和一分钟也不停止对富农进行斗争的党的阶级路线，对于扩大社会主义在农村中的阵地和巩固人民民主制度有着很大的意义。由于许多贫农上升为中农，中农现在已成为欧洲人民民主国家的基本农民群众，但是富农经济今天在农村中仍有一定的影响。作为最后一个的同时也是人数最多的剥削阶级的富农阶级，不甘心于自己最后被消灭的命运，正在对农业社会主义改造事业进行剧烈的反抗和千方百计的破坏活动。这就决定了欧洲人民民主国家农村中阶级斗争的复杂性和尖锐性。现在欧洲人民民主国家对富农实行着严格的限制和排挤的政策，等到一旦具备必要的政治和经济的前提时，就将过渡到消灭富农的阶段。
    欧洲人民民主国家的工人阶级和人民政权经常不断地给农业生产合作社以多方面的帮助。这种帮助包括：提供农业机器站的服务，在税收政策、农产品的收购价格方面给予优惠的待遇，降低义务交售额，提供信用贷款，供应大量的生产资料和生活资料，帮助培养、训练合作社的干部，和派遣干部以加强合作社的领导，等等。这些帮助，大大地巩固了农业生产合作社，并进一步加强了作为人民民主制度基础的工农联盟。
    欧洲人民民主国家六、七年来的农业合作化运动已经取得了巨大的成就。但是正如这些国家的共产党和工人党所指出的，农业合作化和社会主义建设的要求比起来，仍有相当的距离。这种距离表现在：这些国家的工业都已有了迅速的发展，同时社会主义所有制也已在工业、运输业和商业等国民经济部门中占有绝对的优势，但是农业却还显著地落后于工业的发展，而且在农业中今天个体私有制仍然占有很大的比重。显然，不根本改变农业中的落后的生产关系，就不可能促进农业生产力的迅速发展，同时也会影响整个社会主义建设的进程。
    因此，经过最近大约两年时间的整顿和巩固阶段以后，欧洲人民民主国家的党和政府现在已作出规划，决定在进一步加强现有农业生产合作社的同时，建立更多的新的农业合作社，以便把农业合作化运动更迅速、更广泛地推向前进。如匈牙利已提出了要在第二个五年计划期间，即1960年以前使社会主义成分在农业中占有优势的任务。最近传来的消息表明，东南欧各国的农业生产合作社从今年以来，已经开始了蓬勃的发展。毫无疑问，欧洲人民民主国家社会主义工业化的巨大成就，农业合作化运动所已经奠定的稳固基础，以及这些国家的党和政府的领导，就是农业合作化继续进展和最后完成的可靠保证。
