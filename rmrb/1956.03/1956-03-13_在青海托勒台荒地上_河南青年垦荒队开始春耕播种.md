On March 8th, in the 6,000 mu of wasteland in Tolegtai, Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, the youth volunteer reclamation team from Henan Province began spring planting. 500 young men and women are using new-style animal-powered farm tools such as two-wheeled double-furrow plows, disc harrows, and seeders to reclaim and sow simultaneously, preparing to first complete the 4,000 mu spring wheat sowing plan, and then plant highland barley, broad beans, potatoes, and oil crops. They stated that they would produce 2.33 million jin of grain on this newly reclaimed virgin land.

This youth volunteer reclamation team arrived in the reclamation area on February 25th. The team members threw themselves into work on the second day, including surveying, repairing farm tools, digging canals, finding fertilizer sources, and building roads. Socialist competition was also launched between the production teams. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    在青海托勒台荒地上
    河南青年垦荒队开始春耕播种
    3月8日，在青海省海南藏族自治州托勒台的6，000亩荒地上，来自河南省的青年志愿垦荒队开始了春耕播种。500名男女青年正在使用双轮双铧犁、圆盘耙、播种机等新式畜力农具边垦边播，准备先完成4，000亩春小麦播种计划，然后再种青稞、蚕豆、洋芋以及油料作物。他们表示要在这片新开垦的处女地上生产出233万斤粮食。
