Lanxin Railway Workers Strive for "July 1st" Opening to Traffic to Yumen

(Our newspaper, Guiyang, 13th dispatch) The Guizhou-Guangxi Railway has already laid track into Guizhou Province. At 1 PM on the 12th, the tracks were laid 2 kilometers past Siting in Dushan County. When the train loaded with railway construction materials arrived at Siting, people of all ethnic groups here warmly welcomed it at the station.

(Our newspaper, Lanzhou, 12th dispatch) Worker representatives constructing the Lanxin Railway recently proposed at the activist representative meeting of the First Engineering Area to strive for opening to traffic to Yumen on "July 1st." This is one month ahead of the original plan to open to traffic to Yumen on "August 1st." Currently, the third and fourth engineering sections undertaking the construction task are actively taking measures to ensure the realization of this plan.
