Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The Second Council Meeting (Enlarged) of the Chinese Writers Association, lasting nine days, concluded this afternoon.

These past few days, the council members and writers present listened to reports made by Mao Dun, Zhou Yang, Lao She, and Liu Baiyu, as well as supplementary reports by Chen Huangmei and Kang Tuo. After the representatives conducted heated discussions on the aforementioned reports and the "Work Outline for 1956-1967" (draft) proposed by the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association, they unanimously resolved to approve all the reports at this afternoon's meeting and unanimously adopted the work outline.

The meeting held that since the First Council Meeting convened in 1953, Chinese literature has definitively advanced a major step forward on the path of socialist realism. The connection between literature and the people has expanded significantly compared to the past. One of the prominent phenomena in literary and art circles is the rapid growth of new forces. The task facing writers and all literary workers is to work intensively, study diligently, and create works worthy of this great socialist era. These works should not only possess socialist content but also their own national form, and should integrate all the cultural essence of Chinese history and all the advanced experiences of world culture into our literary creation.

The meeting held that Chinese literary creation is beginning to flourish, and writers have demonstrated an increasingly high creative enthusiasm. However, literary works still fall far short of meeting the needs of the masses, the subjects are not broad enough, and the works have not reached the level required by readers in terms of ideology and art. The meeting focused on criticizing the formalism, naturalism, and other tendencies that violate realism currently existing in literary and artistic creation. The meeting pointed out that in order to overcome these tendencies, writers must delve into life and improve their ideological cultivation and artistic skills. This conference should become a conference to mobilize writers to go into life; after the meeting, writers should enthusiastically go to factories, mines, construction sites, rural areas, border areas, and all fronts of socialist construction and socialist transformation.

The meeting pointed out that the struggle against bourgeois idealist literary and artistic thought, the purge of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique in literary and art circles, and the struggle against sectarian clique activities over the past year or two have achieved important results, which have cleared away major obstacles for further development of literary and artistic creation. In the future, we should continue to wage a resolute struggle against various reactionary bourgeois ideological manifestations in literature and art, and on this basis, combine the collation of Chinese literary heritage from past dynasties and the study of the vivid experience of the modern literary movement to build Marxist-Leninist literary and artistic theory and literary and artistic criticism.

The meeting also discussed the issue of cultivating young authors and developing the literary and artistic undertakings of fraternal ethnic groups. The meeting held that cultivating a large number of young authors is the responsibility of all writers and the Writers Association. We must oppose conservatism and the tendency to underestimate the role of young authors. Young authors should be given comprehensive assistance to ensure that they follow the correct path from the beginning. The meeting pointed out that in the future, we should actively develop the creation of literature by fraternal ethnic groups, strengthen the work of collecting, collating, and translating literary works of fraternal ethnic groups, and cultivate writers, translators, and literary cadres of fraternal ethnic groups.

The meeting pointed out that the Writers Association bears an important responsibility in the great work of building socialist literature. In its future work, it should take the development of literary creation and the improvement of the ideological and artistic level of literary works as its central tasks; it should guarantee the necessary conditions for writers to carry out creation, strengthen the ideological education of writers, further expand the connection between literature and the people, and strengthen ties with relevant departments and groups, overcoming and preventing tendencies towards sectarianism and closed-doorism.

Mao Dun, Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, said in his closing remarks that this meeting was successful, and the biggest characteristic of the meeting was that the writers demonstrated a high degree of socialist enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm, while also being full of the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. Mao Dun said that there will certainly be many difficulties on the road to building socialist literature. Writers must strive to study Marxism-Leninism, delve into life, improve artistic skills, and actively engage in creative labor; at the same time, they should pay attention to preventing arrogance and complacency. In its future work, the Writers Association should further strengthen collective leadership, strengthen unity among writers, fully carry out free discussions in literary work, and organize the strength of the vast number of writers to work together for the construction of socialist literature.

At this afternoon's meeting, the council members attending the meeting also unanimously passed a resolution to establish the Secretariat of the Chinese Writers Association and additionally elected Zhang Guangnian, Chen Qitong, Guo Xiaochuan, Ziya, and Na. Saiyinchaoketu as council members of the Chinese Writers Association.

    中国作家协会理事会会议闭幕
    通过1956年到1967年的工作纲要
    新华社6日讯  历时九天的中国作家协会第二次理事会会议（扩大）今天下午闭幕。
    这几天，到会的理事和作家们听了茅盾、周扬、老舍、刘白羽所作的报告以及陈荒煤、康濯的补充报告。代表们对上述报告以及中国作家协会主席团提出的“1956年到1967年的工作纲要”（草案）进行了热烈的讨论以后，在今天下午的会议上，一致决议同意各项报告，并且一致通过了工作纲要。
    会议认为，1953年召开第一次理事会以来，中国的文学已经在社会主义现实主义的轨道上确定地前进了一大步。文学同人民的联系比以前扩大很多了。文艺界突出的现象之一是新生力量的迅速成长。作家和一切文学工作者面临的任务，就是要紧张工作，刻苦学习，创作出无愧于这个伟大的社会主义时代的作品。这些作品不只要具有社会主义的内容，而且要具有自己的民族形式，应当把中国历史上全部文化精华和世界文化的一切先进经验都融合在我们的文学创作中。
    会议认为，中国的文学创作正在开始兴旺起来，作家们表现了日益高涨的创作热情。但是文学作品还远远不能满足人民群众的需要，题材还不广泛，作品在思想上和艺术上都没有达到读者所要求的水平。会议着重批判了当前文艺创作上存在的公式主义、自然主义及其他各种违反现实主义的倾向。会议指出，要想克服这些倾向，作家就必须深入生活，提高思想修养和艺术技巧。这次大会应当成为动员作家到生活中去的大会，会议以后作家们应当踊跃地到工厂、矿山、工地、农村、边疆去，到社会主义建设和社会主义改造的各个战线上去。
    会议指出，一两年来反对资产阶级唯心主义文艺思想、在文艺界中肃清胡风反革命集团以及反对宗派性小集团活动的斗争，已经取得了重要的成果，这就给进一步发展文艺创作扫除了重大的障碍。今后应当继续对文艺上各种反动的资产阶级思想的表现进行坚决的斗争，并且在这个基础上，结合整理中国历代文学遗产和研究现代文学运动的生动经验，来建设马克思列宁主义的文艺理论和文艺批评。
    会议还讨论了培养青年作者和发展兄弟民族文艺事业的问题。会议认为，大量地培养青年作者是所有作家和作家协会的责任。必须反对保守主义、对青年作者的作用估计不足的倾向。对青年作者应当进行全面的帮助，一开始就使他们循着正确的道路前进。会议指出，今后应积极发展兄弟民族文学的创作，加强搜集、整理、翻译兄弟民族文学作品的工作，培养兄弟民族的作家、翻译人才和文学干部。
    会议指出，作家协会在建设社会主义文学的伟大工作中负有重要责任，在今后的工作中它应当以发展文学创作，提高文学作品的思想和艺术水平为自己的中心任务；应当保证作家进行创作的必要条件，加强对作家的思想教育工作，进一步扩大文学同人民的联系，并加强同有关部门、团体的联系，克服和防止宗派主义和关门主义的倾向。
    中国作家协会主席茅盾在致闭幕词的时候说，这次会议是成功的，会议的最大的特点就是：作家们表现了高度的社会主义积极性和劳动热情，同时充满了批评和自我批评的精神。茅盾说，在建设社会主义文学的道路上是一定会有许多困难的。作家们今后必须努力学习马克思列宁主义，深入生活，提高艺术技巧，积极进行创作劳动；同时要注意防止骄傲自满。作家协会在今后的工作中应当进一步加强集体领导，加强作家之间的团结，充分开展文学工作中的自由讨论，把广大作家的力量组织起来，共同为建设社会主义的文学而努力。
    在今天下午的会议上，参加会议的理事还一致通过了成立中国作家协会书记处的决议，并且补选和增选了张光年、陈其通、郭小川、孜亚、纳·赛音朝克图为中国作家协会理事。
