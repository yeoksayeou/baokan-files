Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 26th -- The CCP committees in various parts of Jilin Province have organized large numbers of water conservancy technical cadres to go to agricultural production cooperatives, using a "contract to the end" method to impart technology. They led well-digging teams to visit construction sites and hold discussions, initially reversing the phenomenon of low engineering quality. In the Eighth District of Yushu County, forty wells failed to produce water after being dug due to unsuitable site selection, affecting the farmers' enthusiasm for well-digging. Technicians and farmer technicians conducted on-site summaries and re-surveyed and planned the locations of 192 wells, which then ignited a new wave of well-digging enthusiasm. The Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau organized a group of farmer technicians to visit eight reservoirs in Hailong, Panshi, and other counties, explaining the principles of reservoirs and methods of preventing leaks on the spot.

Various localities have also widely promoted various well-digging tools on construction sites that can accelerate speed and save expenses. Yushu, Jiutai, Dehui, and other counties used the "cone well to lower spring" method for well-digging, but only completed one-tenth of the plan due to encountering highly viscous underground silt. Recently, farmer technicians were organized to visit the drilling-type well-digging tools first promoted in Yushu County and immediately promoted them. Using this new type of well-digging tool, a water well can be dug in two days and nights, saving two-thirds of the manpower.

    吉林派出大批技术干部指导农民打井
    据新华社长春26日电　中共吉林省各地党委组织大批水利技术干部到农业生产合作社，采用包干到底的办法传授技术。他们带领打井队员，到工地参观和讨论，开始扭转了工程质量不高的现象。榆树县八号区有四十眼井因为地址选的不合适，打成后不来水，影响了农民打井情绪。技术人员和农民技术手就地进行总结，重新勘查和规划了192眼井的位置，才又掀起了打井热潮。省水利局组织一批农民技术手到海龙、磐石等县八处水库参观，就地讲解了水库原理和防止漏洞的办法。
    各地还普遍在工程现场推广了能加快速度和节省开支的各种打井工具。榆树、九台、德惠等县使用锥井下泉办法打井，由于遇到地下粘性很强的淤泥，仅完成计划十分之一。最近组织农民技术手参观了首先在榆树县推广的钻探式打井工具，并且立即推广。使用这种新式打井工具，两昼夜可打出一眼水井，而且节省三分之二的人力。
