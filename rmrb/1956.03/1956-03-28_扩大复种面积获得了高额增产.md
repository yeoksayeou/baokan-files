    Increased Replanting Area Achieves High Yield Increase
    Xu Side
    The "Communism" agricultural production cooperative led by Zhang Shirui in Xiaozhaizi Village, Chengyang Town, Jimo County, Shandong Province, is one of the well-known high-yield cooperatives with a large area in Shandong Province.

    Although the Xiaozhaizi Village area is a plain, rainfall is uneven. In the past, various natural disasters were frequent, and farming techniques were very low. Farmers were accustomed to the farming methods of one crop a year, three crops in two years, and sparse planting. Therefore, the unit area yield of various crops was very low at that time. In 1952, the agricultural production cooperative led by Zhang Shirui was established in this village, and the output of farmland in the cooperative has significantly increased year by year. In 1952, the average output value per mu of the entire cooperative was 72.24 yuan (of which, grain output was 405.68 jin, worth 29.54 yuan, and vegetable income was 42.7 yuan). By 1955, the output value per mu increased to 95.3 yuan (grain output was 527.5 jin, worth 39.6 yuan, and vegetable income was 55.7 yuan). The output value in 1954 and 1955 increased by nine to ten times compared to 1949. The cooperative has consistently outproduced farmers outside the cooperative every year.

    The main reason why this agricultural cooperative has been able to achieve high yields year after year is that it has vigorously promoted intercropping, relay cropping, crop rotation, and other yield-increasing methods, changing from one crop a year and three crops in two years to two crops and two harvests a year, two harvests or three harvests in three crops a year, and three harvests in four crops a year, thereby greatly increasing the planting area and increasing yields.

    Before sowing each year, this cooperative conducts a careful analysis and study of all farmland, and according to the different conditions of soil and crop growth period, adopts intercropping, relay cropping, and crop rotation methods to plant various tubers and grains. Because the crop growth period and stubble are different, the forms of intercropping and relay cropping are also very different. In wheat stubble fields, it is generally autumn corn intercropped with soybeans, and wheat is sown in time after harvest; or sweet potatoes are planted after wheat is harvested, and corn or soybeans are intercropped in the sweet potato furrows. In spring fields, some are spring corn relay cropped in spring potato fields, followed by wheat; some are autumn corn relay cropped in tomato fields, followed by wheat; some are spring corn relay cropped in spring potato fields, followed by Chinese cabbage; and some are spring corn relay cropped in spring potato fields, spring potatoes are harvested between the summer solstice and minor heat, and autumn potatoes are continuously cropped one or two days after the beginning of autumn, and wheat is sown after the corn harvest. Among these farming methods, the yields of three crops a year and four crops a year are the highest. The number and yield of each intercropped and relay cropped crop and single crop are roughly the same. The average actual yield of corn per mu is 700 jin, with the highest reaching 850 jin to 970 jin, wheat yields around 300 jin, potatoes 1,820 jin, and cabbage 8,500 jin. While promoting intercropping and relay cropping, the cooperative implemented a crop rotation method of planting vegetables for one year and then grain for one year, or planting vegetables for one season and then grain for one season, on all land, which saved fertilizer, reduced pests and diseases, and increased yields.

    In order to ensure that the implementation of intercropping, relay cropping, and crop rotation achieves the due results, the "Communism" agricultural production cooperative, in addition to adopting measures such as using all improved varieties, rational close planting, deep plowing and fine harrowing, weeding, and preventing and controlling pests and diseases, pays special attention to fertilization and irrigation. They say: "We must ensure that the land is fed with enough fertilizer and drinks enough water." In 1952, there were only eight cooperative members in the cooperative, and they dug nine wells. In 1955, there were 129 cooperative members, and there were already 295 waterwheel wells, with irrigated land accounting for more than 70% of the total cultivated area, ensuring that there was well water irrigation in the intercropped land. The cooperative pays great attention to raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer in large quantities. In 1955, the pig manure, green manure, urine manure, dry ash, chicken and sheep manure, and other natural fertilizers accumulated by the cooperative and its members ensured the large amount of fertilizer needed for intercropping and relay cropping. From 1952 to 1955, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu of land in the entire cooperative increased from four and a half carts to eight carts. In order to improve fertilization techniques, the cooperative, through its own fertilizer experimental farm, tested the effects of various natural fertilizers and chemical fertilizers with different compositions on crops, and according to the needs of the crops and the effectiveness of the fertilizers, carried out manure-seed separation, appropriately increased base fertilizer, and rationally topdressed in stages according to soil properties, fertilizer base, and different crops.

    By 1955, the intercropping and relay cropping area of the cooperative had reached 89.1% of the total cultivated area. This achievement was not easily obtained, but was the result of Zhang Shirui and the cooperative members' active research on technology over the years.

    How did the agricultural production cooperative led by Zhang Shirui master the yield-increasing technologies such as intercropping, relay cropping, and crop rotation?

    In the spring of 1952, Zhang Shirui discovered materials on high-yield corn at an exhibition in Jinan, and was inspired by the Michurin theory. After returning to the cooperative, he repeatedly pondered a principle: the more times a vegetable garden is planted in a year, the more fertile the land becomes; trees planted on barren mountains that have not been touched for many years are not as vigorous as trees planted on cultivated land. This proves that the saying that "planting too many crops will exhaust the land's fertility" is unfounded. Years of practice and research have made him understand that different crops absorb different nutrients, and he also understands the importance of air and sunlight to crop growth. He thought: Land fertility is not completely exhausted, different crops absorb different nutrients, and if ventilation and light are taken into consideration, planting two crops on one piece of land, such as corn and potatoes, may increase production. If this could really be done, wouldn't one mu of land be equivalent to two mu? Some cooperative members said that he was daydreaming, but he found examples of successful intercropping from the masses. Zhang Tuanzheng's family in this village had millet planted one year that was missing seedlings, and later replanted beans and sorghum, which resulted in increased yields; and six or seven families also occasionally planted some sorghum in sparsely planted potato ditches in the spring of 1951, which also increased yields. Therefore, he became more confident in his ideas.

    In the spring of 1952, with the support of the Party branch, Zhang Shirui began to experiment with intercropping methods, intercropping 3 mu of spring corn and spring potatoes. Initially, the seedlings grew very vigorously. However, it happened to be a spring drought at that time. The Party branch led the cooperative members to dig wells and irrigate the fields in time to protect the seedlings. After the wells were dug, the cooperative concentrated its efforts on building pig pens, actively raising pigs to accumulate fertilizer, and catching and killing pests. The entire cooperative applied hundreds of large carts of pig manure to the land in stages, and used water from the new wells to irrigate the fields and gardens. Due to overcoming natural disasters and increasing the application of fertilizer, the spring corn intercropped that year yielded more than 800 jin per mu, and the spring potatoes yielded more than 1,500 jin; the Chinese cabbage planted after the corn was harvested also yielded more than 8,000 jin. The good news of the intercropping harvest spread throughout the nearby villages. From then on, under the leadership and encouragement of the Party branch and with the help and support of the cooperative members, Zhang Shirui continued to research technology and carried out intercropping and relay cropping of diverse crops. That summer, according to advanced Soviet experience, Zhang Shirui summer-sowed spring potatoes to prevent seed degeneration, providing improved varieties for planting potatoes in the coming year. During the turn of summer and autumn, Zhang Shirui led the cooperative members to conduct artificial assisted pollination of corn to increase corn production. Zhang Shirui also successfully experimented with relay cropping soybeans in sweet potato furrows, achieving high sweet potato yields without reducing production, and breaking the erroneous saying that "short crops are not suitable for intercropping." After such experiments, Zhang Shirui explored the following rule: intercropping the same type of crops (such as millet and sorghum are the same type, sweet potatoes and potatoes are the same type) does not increase production; relay cropping in stages increases production less; intercropping different types of crops (such as grains and tubers) at the same time can increase production, and relay cropping at different times and early or late can increase production even more.

    The experience of the "Communism" cooperative in high yields has not only gradually spread in this village and area, but also in this county and special zone. After the cooperative led by Zhang Shirui was transformed into an advanced cooperative, it expanded the agricultural technology research group and established a more than 30-mu experimental farm in order to continue to improve agricultural techniques and increase the yield per unit area of farmland.

    扩大复种面积获得了高额增产
    徐思德
    山东省即墨县城阳镇小寨子村张式瑞所领导的“共产主义”农业生产合作社，是山东省有名的大面积高额丰产合作社之一。
    小寨子村一带虽是一片平原，但雨量不匀，过去各种自然灾害频繁，耕作技术很低，农民习惯于一年一熟、二年三熟和稀植的耕作方法。因此，那时各种作物的单位面积产量很低。1952年这个村创建了由张式瑞领导的农业生产合作社，社里的农田产量逐年显著提高。1952年全社平均每亩产值72.24元（其中，粮食产量是405.68斤，折钱29.54元，种菜收入42.7元），到1955年每亩产值增加到95.3元（粮食产量是527.5斤，折钱39.6元，种菜收入55.7元）。1954年和1955年的产值比1949年提高了九倍至十倍。合作社年年都比社外农民增产。
    这个农业合作社所以能够连年获得高额增产的成绩，主要原因是大力推行了间种、套种、轮作等这些增产办法，把一年一作和二年三作改为一年二作二收、一年三作二收或三收、一年四作三收，从而大大地增加了播种面积，提高了产量。
    这个合作社在每年播种之先，就对所有的耕田进行认真的分析研究，根据土壤和作物成长期限的不同情况，分别采取间种、套种、轮作的方法，种上各种薯类和谷类。因为作物成长期和茬口不同，间种、套种的形式也大不相同。在麦茬地内，一般是秋玉米间种大豆，收获后再及时种上小麦；或者割完小麦栽上甘薯，再在甘薯垅沟内间种上玉米或大豆。在春田内，有的是在春马铃薯地内套种春玉米，下茬种小麦；有的是在西红柿地内套种秋玉米，下茬种小麦；也有的是在春马铃薯地内套种春玉米，下茬种大白菜；还有的是在春马铃薯地内套种春玉米，夏至、小暑之间收获春马铃薯，立秋后一二日再连作秋马铃薯，玉米收获后播种小麦。这些耕作方法中间，以一年三作和一年四作的产量最高，每样间种、套种作物和单种作物的棵数、产量大体相同，平均每亩实产玉米七百斤，最高的达到850斤至970斤，产小麦三百斤左右、马铃薯1，820斤，白菜八千五百斤。在推行间种套种的同时，合作社在全部土地上实行了种一年菜再种一年粮，或者种一季菜再种一季粮的轮作方法，这样就节省了肥料，减少了病虫害，提高了产量。
    为了保证推行间种、套种、轮作获得应有的成效，“共产主义”农业生产合作社除了采取全用良种、合理密植、深耕细耙、除草、防治病虫害等措施以外，特别重视施肥和灌溉，他们说：“务必叫土地吃饱肥喝足水。”1952年，社里只有八户社员，就打了九眼井。1955年有129户社员，已有水车井295眼，水浇田占总耕田面积的70％强，保证了间种地内都有井水灌溉。合作社很注意大量养猪积肥。1955年，社里和社员积的猪肥和绿肥、尿肥、干灰、鸡羊肥等大量自然肥料，保证了推行间种、套种所需要的大量肥料。从1952年至1955年，全社土地每亩施肥量由四车半增加到八车。为了改进施肥技术，合作社通过自设的肥料试验场，试验了各种不同成分的自然肥料和化学肥料对作物的作用，根据作物的需要和肥料的功效，作到按土壤性质、肥分基础和作物的不同，进行粪种隔离、适量增多基肥和分期合理追肥。
    到1955年，合作社的间种套种面积已达到耕田总面积的89.1％。这个成绩并不是轻易得来的，而是张式瑞和社员们几年来积极钻研技术的结果。
    张式瑞所领导的农业生产合作社是怎样掌握了间种、套种、轮作等增产技术的呢？
    1952年的春天，张式瑞在济南的一个展览会上发现了玉米高额丰产的材料，并且受到了米丘林学说的启发，回社后他就反复琢磨一个道理：一年种多少次的菜园，地是越种越肥；多少年没动的荒山上栽的树，就不如熟地上栽的树旺盛。这证明，怕“多种了庄稼会把地力拔尽了”的说法，是没有根据的。多年来的实践和钻研，使他懂得了不同的作物吸收不同的养分，也懂得了空气和阳光对作物生长的重要作用。他想：地力消耗不完，不同的作物吸收不同的养分，再照顾到通风透光，在一块地种上两种庄稼，譬如说玉米和马铃薯，是可能增产的。要是这点真能办到，岂不是一亩地顶二亩地用？有些社员说他这是妄想，可是他却从群众中找到了间种成功的实例。本村张团正家有一年种的谷子缺了苗，后来又补种了豆子和黍子，结果都增加了产量；还有六七家，1951年春天在稀植马铃薯沟里偶尔种上了点高粱，也都增加了产量。因此，他更加相信自己的想法。
    1952年春天，张式瑞在党支部的支持下开始试验间种方法，间种了3亩春玉米和春马铃薯。最初，小苗长得很旺。但是当时正赶上春旱。党支部领导社员们打井及时浇田保苗。打好了井，合作社就集中力量修筑猪圈，积极养猪积肥、捕打害虫。全社把数百大车猪肥分期下了地，并用新井的水来灌溉田园。由于战胜了自然灾害，增施了肥料，那年间种的春玉米每亩产八百多斤，春马铃薯产一千五百多斤；收了玉米后种上的白菜也收了八千多斤。间种丰收的喜讯，传遍了附近村庄。从这以后，张式瑞在党支部的领导鼓励下，在社员们的帮助支持下，继续钻研技术，进行了多样作物的间种套种。那年夏天，张式瑞根据苏联先进经验，把春马铃薯夏播，防止了种子的退化，使来年种马铃薯有了良种。在夏秋之交，张式瑞领导社员对玉米进行人工辅助授粉，提高玉米产量。张式瑞还试验成功了在甘薯垅沟里套种大豆的办法，取得了甘薯不减产，额外得了豆子的高额产量，打破了“矮棵作物不宜间种”的错误说法。经过这样的试验，张式瑞摸索出这样的规律：同类的作物（如谷子和黍子是同类，甘薯和马铃薯是同类）同时间种不增产；分期套种少增产；异类作物（如谷类和薯类）同时套种能增产，分别早晚套种更增产。
    “共产主义”合作社的丰产经验，不仅在本村本区逐渐推广开来，而且在本县、本专区也推广了。张式瑞领导的这个合作社转为高级社以后，扩大了农业技术研究组，设立了30多亩大的试验场，以便继续改进农作技术，提高农田单位面积产量。
