Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 10th. The interference of the Manila Treaty Organization in Kashmir affairs has provoked strong reactions among Indian politicians.

According to the Indian United Press, after the Council of States (Rajya Sabha) concluded its question period on March 8, two members requested the Council to discuss the Manila Treaty Organization Council's opinion on the Kashmir issue.

Prime Minister Nehru replied that this was a "serious matter."

At the meeting of the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly currently being held in Jammu, Congress Party member Krishnadev Sethi said that the Manila Treaty Organization Council's opinion on the Kashmir issue is tantamount to interference in our country's internal affairs. He said that the Soviet Union, based on the principle of respecting the wishes of the people, respects the decision of the people of Kashmir, while the United States has concluded alliances such as the Manila Treaty Organization and the Middle East Defense Organization to deprive the people of India and Kashmir of their hard-won freedom. He said that the United States is also inciting people inside and outside the state of Kashmir to disrupt its stability.

Sethi said, "However, the United States should know that we, the people of India and Kashmir, are fully aware of how to fight against this kind of conspiracy."

Member Kurbir Singh said that the imperialist countries "hope to turn Kashmir into a military base."

Another member, Mohammed Ayub Khan, said that Kashmir expresses its gratitude to the Soviet Union for supporting its position.

    印度政界人士反对喀喇蚩会议干涉克什米尔事务
    新华社新德里10日电　马尼拉条约组织干涉克什米尔的事务，在印度政界人士中引起了激烈的反应。
    据印度统一通讯社报道，在3月8日联邦院结束了它的质询项目以后，两个议员要求联邦院讨论马尼拉条约组织理事会对克什米尔问题的意见。
    尼赫鲁总理在回答时说，这是一个“严重的问题”。
    在正在查谟举行的克什米尔立法议会的会议上，国大党议员克里希纳德夫·塞蒂说，马尼拉条约组织理事会对克什米尔问题的意见等于是干涉我国的内政。他说，苏联根据尊重人民的愿望的原则是尊重克什米尔人民的决定的，而美国却缔结了像马尼拉条约组织、中东防御组织这样的同盟来剥夺印度和克什米尔人民辛苦赢得的自由。他说，美国还在克什米尔邦内外煽动人们扰乱它的稳定。
    塞蒂说，“但是，美国应该知道，我们印度和克什米尔人是充分知道如何同这种阴谋作斗争的。”
    议员库尔比尔·辛格说，帝国主义国家“希望把克什米尔变成军事基地”。
    另一位议员穆罕默德·阿尤布汗说，克什米尔对苏联支持它的立场表示感谢。
