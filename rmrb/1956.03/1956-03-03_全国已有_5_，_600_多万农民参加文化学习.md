    Over 56 Million Farmers Nationwide Participate in Cultural Learning
    According to statistics from 24 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions including Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Jiangxi, Guizhou, Heilongjiang, Beijing, and Shanghai, there are currently 56,413,000 farmers participating in cultural learning. This is a 150% increase compared to the number of students enrolled during the same period last year.
    In Hebei Province, 82% of villages have established people's schools, with 4,864,200 farmers enrolled, accounting for 37% of the province's illiterate population. Shandong Province already has 7.5 million farmers enrolled, accounting for 40% of the province's illiterate population. In Liaoning Province, 1.25 million people are participating in learning, accounting for 36% of the illiterate population. In Anhui Province, 5.18 million farmers are participating in learning, accounting for 42% of the illiterate population. In Beijing's eastern suburbs, Nanyuan, Fengtai, Haidian, and Shijingshan districts, all eligible young and middle-aged illiterate individuals have enrolled, accounting for 94% of the young and middle-aged illiterate population in these five districts.
    This year, the number of farmers enrolling in schools in various provinces has generally exceeded plans. Many regions have revised their annual and long-term illiteracy eradication plans based on the development of the work. Hebei Province originally planned to have 2.75 million people participating in learning this spring, but now requires 50% of the province's illiterate farmers, approximately 6.58 million people, to enroll before spring plowing, including all 4.66 million young illiterate individuals. By the end of August, 950,000 illiterate people will be eliminated. Henan and Jiangsu provinces originally planned to eliminate illiteracy by 1960, but now plan to eliminate it by 1959. Shaanxi, Shandong, Hunan, and other provinces have moved the illiteracy elimination deadline from 1961 to 1960. Jilin, Heilongjiang, Anhui, Sichuan, Hubei, and other provinces have also revised their illiteracy elimination plans.
    This year, the establishment of schools by agricultural producers' cooperatives in various regions has seen new development. In Jiangxi Province, 70% of agricultural producers' cooperatives have established people's schools. In the Zhangjiakou Special Zone of Hebei, 96% of cooperatives have established people's schools.
    Various regions have also compiled literacy textbooks that combine learning with practical application, according to the principle of "learning for application." In the Changzhi Special Zone of Shanxi Province, 683 people's schools have compiled literacy textbooks that combine learning with practical application. In Haiyan, Dongyang, Xindeng, Cixi, and other counties in Zhejiang Province, demonstration textbooks compiled by the counties have been fully promoted throughout the counties. Some counties in Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei, Hunan, Henan, and other provinces have begun to compile the second volume of literacy textbooks. The new literacy textbooks have achieved good teaching results and are welcomed by the masses.

    据山西、山东、河南、河北、江西、贵州、黑龙江、北京、上海等24个省、市和自治区的统计，目前已经有56，413，000农民参加文化学习。比去年同时期入学人数增加了150％。
    河北省82％的村庄办了民校，入学农民有4，864，200人，占全省文盲数的37％。山东省已有750万农民入学，占全省文盲数的40％。辽宁省有125万人参加学习，占文盲数的36％。安徽省参加学习的农民有518万人，占文盲数的42％。北京市东郊、南苑、丰台、海淀和石景山等5个区有条件学习的青、壮年文盲已经全部入学。占这5个区青、壮年文盲数的94％。
    今年各省农民入学人数一般都超过计划。许多地区已经根据工作发展情况，修订了扫除文盲的年度规划和远景规划。河北省原订今春有275万人参加学习，现在要求春耕前组织全省农民文盲的50％，约计658万人入学，其中青年文盲466万人将全部入学，到八月底以前，扫除文盲95万人。河南、江苏两省原订到1960年扫除文盲，现在计划到1959年就扫除文盲。陕西、山东、湖南等省把扫除文盲年限从1961年提前到1960年。吉林、黑龙江、安徽、四川、湖北等省也都把扫除文盲规划作了修订。
    今年各地农业生产合作社办校有了新的发展。江西省70％的农业生产合作社都办了民校。河北张家口专区有96％的社办了民校。
    各地还根据“学以致用”的原则，编写了记工识字课本。山西省长治专区有683所民校编写了记工识字课本。浙江省海盐、东阳、新登、慈溪等县由县里编的示范课本，已经在各该县全面推广。山东、山西、河北、湖南、河南等省的部分县已经开始编写第二册识字课本。新识字课本教学效果很好，受到广大群众的欢迎。
