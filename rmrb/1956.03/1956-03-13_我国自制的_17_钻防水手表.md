China-Made 17-Jewel Waterproof Watch

　　A batch of 17-jewel, 3-hand, luminous, waterproof watches made in China was on display at the recent "Shanghai Daily-Use Industrial Products Quality Comparison Exhibition." This batch of watches was successfully trial-produced by 58 watch technicians from 28 units, including the joint state-private China Clock Factory and Daguangming Clock Factory.

　　Except for the diamonds in some of the watches, all the parts of these watches are made in China, so the cost is much lower than imported goods. After testing, these watches prove to be running normally, with good appearance and waterproof performance.

    我国自制的17钻防水手表
    在最近举行的“上海日用工业品质量比较展览会”里陈列了一批17钻长3针夜光防水手表。这批手表是由公私合营中国钟厂、大光明钟厂等28个单位58个钟表技师试制成功的。
    这批手表的零件，除一部分手表的钻石外，全部是我国自己制造的，因此成本大大低于进口货。这批手表经过测定，证明运转正常，外观和防水效能也好。
