    Great Plans for Socialist Construction in the Soviet Union

    The World's First Atomic Icebreaker

    Preparations are underway at a Soviet shipyard to create the world's first atomic icebreaker. A recent issue of "Moscow News" published a Q&A, introducing this icebreaker.

    The icebreaker's power engine has a generating capacity of 44,000 horsepower and a displacement of 16,000 tons. The fuel it stores can supply it for a year of sailing. It can go to places where no icebreaker dares to go at present. In addition to escort work, it can also be used for research work in the central Arctic Ocean region.

    Atomic icebreakers have many indisputable advantages. As everyone knows, the engine capacity of steam icebreakers rarely exceeds 10,000 horsepower, and the maximum capacity of the latest diesel-electric engines is only 20,000 to 25,000 horsepower; the engine capacity of atomic icebreakers will be nearly one to three times higher than them. In terms of fuel consumption, a 15,000-horsepower atomic-powered engine consumes only about 55 grams of nuclear fuel in 24 hours, while a diesel engine of the same horsepower will require 85 tons of liquid fuel. An atomic ship's engine will be about 20% lighter than any turbine engine, and the area occupied by this atomic device will not exceed that of an ordinary ship's engine, and the area for loading fuel will be much smaller. In addition, the work required for an atomic icebreaker to sail can be reduced by about half, and the number of crew members is also much smaller. Thanks to automation and remote control, the crew only needs to operate the buttons.

    Part of the power generated by the atomic icebreaker's nuclear reactor can be used to propel the ship's water jet, and the powerful water column ejected by the water jet can break the surrounding ice. The icebreaker will easily adapt to the harsh Arctic climate and complex meteorological environment. It also has new navigation and radio positioning devices to ensure safety and maintain close contact with the ships in the convoy. The icebreaker is also equipped with two helicopters for reconnaissance flights. (Xinhua News Agency)

    A Huge Third Steel Base

    The 20th Congress of the CPSU decided that the Soviet Union will establish a third steel base in Siberia. This base will produce 15 million to 20 million tons of pig iron annually. Regarding this matter, Soviet Deputy Minister of the Iron and Steel Industry Vishnevsky said in an article published in "Labor News": The factory built in Siberia will refine about seven times the amount of pig iron produced by the Soviet Union's largest existing steel plant, the Kuznetsk Steel Combine, exceeding the output of Britain, France, or West Germany. First, the "Siberia" factory and two other factories will be built. A huge electric furnace workshop and rolling mill workshop will be added to the Kuznetsk Steel Combine. The new factory will smelt local iron ore. Before the development of the Lower Angarsk iron ore, the Korshunovo iron ore will be used. The newly built factories will be modern large factories. For example, the "Siberia" factory will include blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, rolling mills, coking, sintering, etc. In the future, the effective volume of the new plant's blast furnaces will reach 1,513 and 2,000 cubic meters. The steelmaking workshop will adopt continuous steel casting procedures to reduce equipment such as steel ingot heating furnaces. The steel rolling production process will be highly mechanized and automated. Powerful rolling mills will rapidly roll steel continuously or semi-continuously. This factory will use radioactive isotopes to inspect steel.

    Increase Kuzbass Coal Production to Nearly 100 Million Tons

    Kuzbass will greatly increase its coal production during the Soviet Union's Sixth Five-Year Plan period. Kuzbass, located in southwestern Siberia, is one of the Soviet Union's largest coal-producing areas. By 1960, the Kuzbass Coal United Enterprise will mine 88 million tons of coal, of which 32 million tons will be coking coal. The increase in coal mining in Kuzbass in these five years alone is equal to its total coal mining volume in 1949. The manager of the Kuzbass Coal United Enterprise said in "Pravda": After realizing the estimated production capacity and potential of all coal mines, the coal production can be increased by 20,000 tons per day. The plan is to increase labor productivity by 40% in these five years. The newly built coal mines will increase the average daily coal production of the United Enterprise by 42,000 tons. By 1960, the coal mined by open-pit mines in Kuzbass will reach 20 million tons, which is three and a half times that of 1955.

    The Largest Waterway in the Reclaimed Area

    Several large waterways hundreds of kilometers long will be built in the reclaimed areas of the Soviet Union's east. They will pass through the main reclaimed areas of North Kazakhstan, Kostanay, Pavlodar, Akmolinsk, and other states, and transport water from the Irtysh River and its largest tributary, the Ishim River, to the arid and water-scarce areas.

    The design work for one of the Soviet Union's largest waterways—the Irtysh Waterway—has been completed and construction will begin this year. The length of the waterway will exceed 1,000 kilometers, and construction will begin simultaneously from both ends. After the waterway is completed, the water from the Irtysh River will flow along it into the reclaimed area, and its four pumping stations can supply 36,500 cubic meters of water per day. Ninety-six residential areas, seventeen state-owned farms, collective farms, machine tractor stations, and railway stations will all have access to water.

    The economic significance of the 750-kilometer-long Ishim Waterway is very significant. Originally, the Ishim River flooded in the spring, but it was short of water in the summer. After the Ishim Waterway is completed, its water can flow along the waterway to a reservoir hundreds of kilometers away for storage, instead of being wasted. This reservoir is more than 100 kilometers long and can hold 800 million cubic meters of water. A hydroelectric power station is planned to be built near the reservoir, and the electricity from the hydroelectric power station will be supplied to the surrounding state-owned farms, and pumping stations will be started to irrigate the land of dozens of state-owned farms and collective farms.

    To Divert Northern Rivers

    The survey and research work on diverting northern rivers, which Soviet scientists once conducted before the Great Patriotic War, has recently been resumed. According to the plan, the water from the three rivers in the Soviet north that originally flowed into the Arctic Ocean—the Pechora River, the Vychegda River, and the Sukhona River—will be diverted to the Kama River and the Volga River in order to improve navigation, electricity, and irrigation in these areas. This was stated by V. Semenov, Deputy Chief Engineer of the Soviet Hydroelectric Engineering Department, in an article published in "Moscow News" recently.

    Semenov said that after the water from these three rivers flows into the Kama River and the Volga River, it will increase the power of the Volga River-Kama River power system by 11 billion kilowatt-hours per year, which is equivalent to the annual power generation of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station. In addition, it can greatly improve navigation on the Kama River and the Volga River, ensure more water flows into the Caspian Sea, which has been gradually becoming shallower in recent decades, and allow more land in the surrounding areas to be irrigated with water.

    This plan was proposed by Soviet engineers about twenty years ago. Its feasibility was confirmed in the preliminary survey conducted before the Great Patriotic War. The main project of the plan is to build three large earth dams to block the river water in the upper reaches of these rivers; build canals to divert the river water southward to the Kama River, and then to the Volga River. In this way, a hydroelectric power station can be built in the upper reaches of the Kama River, using the diverted river water to generate electricity completely. (Xinhua News Agency)

    苏联社会主义建设的伟大计划
    世界上第一艘原子破冰船
    创造世界上第一艘原子破冰船的准备工作，正在苏联一个造船厂进行中。最近一期“莫斯科新闻”刊载了一篇答读者问，介绍了这只破冰船。
    这只破冰船的发电引擎的发电能力是四万四千匹马力，排水量是一万六千吨。它所储藏的燃料可以供它航行一年。它可以开往目前任何破冰船不敢去的地方。除了护航工作外，它还可以用来在北极洋中部地区进行研究工作。
    原子破冰船有许多无可争辩的优点。大家知道，蒸汽破冰船引擎的能力很少超过一万匹马力，而最新式的破冰船的最大的柴油——电气引擎的最大能力也不过是二万到二万五千匹马力；原子破冰船的引擎的能力则将近超过它们的一倍到三倍以上。在燃料消耗方面，通常一个一万五千匹马力的以原子为动力的引擎，在二十四小时内只消耗大约五十五克的核子燃料，而马力和它相同的柴油引擎将需要八十五吨液体燃料。一艘原子船的引擎将比任何涡轮引擎轻20％左右，而这个原子装置所占的面积不会超过普通船的引擎，装载燃料的面积则更要小得多。此外，原子破冰船在航行时所需要做的工作大约可以减少一半，船员的数目也少得多。由于自动化和远距离操纵，船员只要按电钮操作就行了。
    原子破冰船的核子反应堆产生的动力，有一部分可以用来推动船只的喷水机，喷水机喷出的强有力的水柱可以冲破四周的冰块。破冰船将易于适应严寒的北极气候和复杂的气象环境。它还有新式航海和无线电定位装置，可以保证安全和同护航队的船只保持密切联系。为了进行勘查飞行，破冰船还装有两架直升飞机。（新华社）
  巨大的第三个钢铁基地
    苏共第二十次代表大会决定，苏联将在西伯利亚建立第三个钢铁基地。这个基地每年将生产一千五百万到二千万吨生铁。关于这件事，苏联钢铁工业部副部长维什?夫斯基在“劳动报”上发表谈话说：在西伯利亚建设的工厂将炼出约为苏联现有最大的钢铁厂——库兹?次克钢铁联合企业的产量七倍的生铁，超过英国、法国或西德的产量。首先将建设“西伯利亚”工厂和其他两个工厂。在库兹?次克钢铁联合企业将增建巨大的电炉车间和轧钢车间。新工厂将冶炼当地的铁矿石。在下安哥拉斯克的铁矿开发以前，使用科尔松诺沃的铁矿。新建的都将是现代化的大工厂。例如，“西伯利亚”工厂将包括高炉、平炉、轧钢、焦化、烧结等等部分。将来新厂的高炉有效容积将达到1，513和二千立方公尺。炼钢车间将采用连续不断的铸钢规程而减少钢锭加热炉之类设备。轧钢的生产过程将是高度机械化和自动化的。强大的轧钢机将连续不断地或半连续不断地迅速轧钢。这个厂将使用放射性同位素检验钢材。

    把库兹巴斯煤产提高到近亿吨
    库兹巴斯在苏联第六个五年计划时期将大大提高采煤量。库兹巴斯在西伯利亚西南部，是苏联最大产煤区之一。到1960年，库兹巴斯煤联合企业采的煤将达八千八百万吨，其中三千二百万吨是焦煤。库兹巴斯仅仅在这五年内增加的采煤量就等于它在1949年的全部采煤量。库兹巴斯煤联合企业经理在“真理报”上说：把所有煤矿的预计的生产能力和潜力发挥以后可以每昼夜增产二万吨煤。计划在这五年内把劳动生产率提高40％。新建的煤矿将使联合企业每昼夜平均采煤量增加四万二千吨。到1960年，在库兹巴斯由露天矿开采的煤将达二千万吨，即为1955年的三倍半。

    开垦区里最大的水道
    苏联东部开垦地区将建设几条长几百公里的大水道。它们将通过主要的开垦区北哈萨克、库斯坦奈、巴夫洛达、阿克摩林斯克等州，把额尔齐斯河和它最大的支流伊什姆河的水输送到干旱的缺水地区。
    苏联最大的水道之一——额尔齐斯水道的设计工作已经完成，将在今年内动工建设。水道的长度将超过一千公里，将从两端同时开始建设。这条水道建成以后，额尔齐斯河的河水将顺着它流入开垦地区，它的四个抽水站每昼夜可以供水三万六千五百公方。九十六个居民点、十七个国营农场、集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和火车站，都将得到用水。
    长达七百五十公里的伊什姆水道的经济意义非常重大。原来伊什姆河在春季涨水，但是到夏天就缺水了，等到伊什姆水道建成以后，它的水就可以顺着水道流到几百公里以外的一个水库中储存起来，而不致浪费掉。这个水库长一百多公里，可以容水八亿立方公尺。水库的附近计划建设一个水电站，水电站的电力将供给周围的国营农场使用，并且将开动抽水机来灌溉几十个国营农场和集体农庄的土地。

    要北部河流改道
    苏联科学家在卫国战争前一度进行过的使北部河流改道的勘查和研究工作，最近又恢复了。根据计划，苏联北部原来流入北冰洋的三条河流——彼朝拉河、维切格达河和苏霍纳河的河水，将改道流入卡马河和伏尔加河，以便改善这些地区的航运、电力和灌溉事业。这是苏联水力工程处副总工程师瓦·谢缅佐夫最近在“莫斯科新闻”发表的一篇文章中说的。
    谢缅佐夫说，这三条河流的水流入卡马河和伏尔加河以后，每年将给伏尔加河—卡马河电力系统增加一百一十亿度的电力，相当于古比雪夫水电站的全年发电量。此外还可以大大改善卡马河和伏尔加河的航运，保证有更多的水流入近数十年来逐渐变浅的里海，使附近地区有更多的土地得到水的灌溉。
    这个计划是苏联工程师约在二十年以前提出的。它的可能性在卫国战争以前进行的初步勘查中即得到了证实。计划的主要工程，是在这些河流的上游建筑三个拦阻河水的大土坝；修筑运河，使河水改道向南流入卡马河，然后再流入伏尔加河。这样，在卡马河上游，就可以建立一个水电站，完全用改道的河水来发电。（新华社）
