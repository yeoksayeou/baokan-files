Xinhua News Agency, 17th Dispatch: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles arrived in Taiwan on March 16th for a "visit." Dulles's trip is intended to cheer up the moribund Chiang Kai-shek clique and consolidate the illegal U.S. occupation of Taiwan.

Upon arriving at Taipei Airport, Dulles issued a statement saying that the United States has always recognized and supported the Chiang Kai-shek clique as the "sole government of China." On the same day, Dulles held two secret talks with Chiang Kai-shek. According to Dulles, these talks were held in accordance with the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty." Sources say that the secret talks focused on the U.S. attitude towards the coastal islands occupied by the Chiang's troops, increasing military and economic assistance to Taiwan, and opposing the relaxation of the embargo.

On the very day that Dulles arrived in Taipei, Liu Hoto, the spokesperson for Chiang Kai-shek's "Ministry of National Defense," announced that Chiang's troops would "take appropriate action" against merchant ships of any nationality passing through ports along the Chinese mainland coast. The piratical behavior of Chiang's troops was obviously encouraged by the United States, which stubbornly insisted on the embargo policy.

Dulles made another statement at the airport when he left Taipei for Seoul on March 17th, praising the Chiang Kai-shek clique for "increasing its defense capabilities." It seems that Dulles clearly wanted to give the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek some comfort, so he specifically revealed that the United States is helping to build a new airport in central Taiwan. Dulles emphasized that this airport would "greatly increase" the capabilities of Chiang Kai-shek's air force.

Xinhua News Agency Dispatch, Seoul: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles arrived in Seoul from Taiwan on the afternoon of March 17th.

Dulles held secret talks with Syngman Rhee and South Korean officials in Seoul. According to South Korean officials, Dulles focused on strengthening the expansion of armaments and war preparations and planning to undermine the armistice agreement. Minister of National Defense Son Won-il said that in a memorandum to Dulles, he requested the abolition of the Korean Armistice Agreement and asked Dulles to provide South Korea with military equipment, including atomic weapons, to strengthen the armed forces of South Korea. Son Won-il also told reporters that Dulles had promised to "fully consider" the issue of the Korean Armistice Agreement.

After his activities in Seoul, Dulles left Seoul and arrived in Japan on the morning of the 18th.

    杜勒斯到台湾和汉城进行活动
    新华社17日讯　美国国务卿杜勒斯曾经在3月16日从马尼拉到达台湾“访问”。杜勒斯此行是要为日暮途穷的蒋介石集团打气，巩固美国对台湾的非法侵占。
    杜勒斯一到台北机场，就发表声明说，美国始终承认并且支持蒋介石集团为“中国的唯一政府”。当天，杜勒斯和蒋介石举行了两次秘密会谈。据杜勒斯说，这种会谈是根据美蒋“共同防御条约”举行的。有消息说，秘密会谈集中讨论了美国对蒋军盘踞下的沿海岛屿的态度、增加对台湾的军事和经济援助以及反对放宽禁运等问题。
    就在杜勒斯到台北的这一天，蒋介石的“国防部”发言人柳鹤图宣布，蒋军将对驶经中国大陆沿海港口的任何国籍的商船“采取适当行动”。蒋军的海盗行为显然是得到了顽固坚持禁运政策的美国的鼓励的。
    杜勒斯3月17日在离开台北前往汉城时又在机场发表谈话，夸奖蒋介石集团“正在增加防御能力”。看来，杜勒斯显然是想要给蒋介石的残兵败将以一点安慰，因此它特意透露说，美国正在帮助在台湾中部建筑一座新飞机场，杜勒斯强调说，这座飞机场将会“大大增加”蒋介石空军的能力。
    据新华社讯　汉城消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯17日下午从台湾到达汉城。
    杜勒斯在汉城同李承晚和南朝鲜的官员们举行了秘密会谈。从南朝鲜官员的透露中可以看出，杜勒斯同他们着重讨论了加强扩军备战和策划破坏停战协定的问题。国防部长官孙元一说，他在给杜勒斯的一项备忘录中，要求废除朝鲜停战协定，并且要求杜勒斯给南朝鲜以包括原子武器在内的军事装备，来加强武装南朝鲜的军队。孙元一还对记者说，杜勒斯已经答应“充分考虑”有关朝鲜停战协定的问题。
    杜勒斯在汉城活动后，已经在18日上午离开汉城到达日本。
