    Why Did We Fall Behind in the Challenge?
    By our reporter Li Ce
    In early January, the Chongqing Machine Tool Plant challenged all machine tool plants in the country, guaranteeing to complete the first Five-Year Plan 15 months ahead of schedule. However, in January, the plant only completed 89.1% of its total output value plan and 67.6% of its commodity output value plan. The February plan has already been affected, and the March plan and the trial production plan for new products in the first half of the year are being threatened.
    The workers believe that they have three most favorable conditions for realizing the challenge: first, mass production this year, with fixed product models; second, assistance from Soviet experts; and third, unprecedented high labor enthusiasm of the workers. The workers also know that after mass production, the production tasks have increased, new workers and new equipment have increased, and the connection of various links in production has become closer. All of this requires management to keep up closely.
    However, the factory leaders and management personnel did not fully utilize these favorable conditions, nor did they pay attention to the new situation in production, nor did they pay attention to preparatory work. They only saw that the production tasks in the fourth quarter of last year increased, the work quota was compressed, new products were successfully trial-produced, and the products were taken abroad for exhibition. Therefore, they were content with the status quo, did not conscientiously implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, and did not actively improve management.
    Since the beginning of October last year, five Soviet experts have successively helped them establish a three-level responsibility system, compiled new process regulations and process routes, and proposed a series of suggestions for the key technical and management issues of each workshop and department, as well as the production preparation work this year. For example, the assembly workshop could not talk about production management during the scattered production period. The experts suggested dividing the workshop into work sections to implement assembly line operations; in order to eliminate production chaos, they suggested implementing "three fixings" (fixing personnel, fixing processes, and fixing locations); in order to prevent rework, they suggested implementing process handover forms, with strict inspection of each process. These are all major measures for implementing comprehensive technical transformation and establishing normal production order. However, the factory did not conscientiously implement them. In January, the assembly workshop made major changes in labor organization five times according to its own methods, and the phenomenon of assembly rework was very serious. In the end, there was no way to go, and only then was the workshop divided into sections to implement assembly line operations. The complete set of process regulations for manufacturing the 532 hobbing machine compiled by the experts for the metalworking workshop originally planned to implement 48 items in January, but by February 20, not a single item had been implemented. As early as October 19 last year, the experts suggested that the administration should prepare various tools as soon as possible according to this year's production situation, but they didn't care. In January, the metalworking workshop lacked tools, and the workers operated new-style lathes, using ordinary lathe tools and centers, rotating only two hundred revolutions per minute. The factory directors and trade union members walked into the workshop, and the workers asked them for tools. Acting Factory Director Song Qian usually only issued orders, without urging or checking. When things came to a head, he said to the tool section chief: "You have made me afraid to go to the workshop. As soon as I get out of the car, the workers reach out to me for tools. What on earth are you doing?"
    The Party organization did not systematically publicize the superiority of Soviet advanced experience to the workers. The Party organization also did not criticize and correct the various incorrect thoughts and behaviors of the workers when they implemented the experts' suggestions, especially when they encountered difficulties.
    In January, 83% of the workers in the forging workshop exceeded the work quota; 64% of the technicians in the metalworking workshop exceeded the new quota, and one-half of the teams completed the January plan ahead of schedule. A fitter team completed 153.44% of the plan. However, this high labor enthusiasm did not produce the due economic results, mainly because the production organization was chaotic and the coordination between various units was not good. Taking the metalworking workshop as an example, the tool section did not provide enough tools; a large number of castings transported from the casting workshop were scrapped during processing. What's worse, the labor and wage section did not allocate enough labor force according to the needs in advance, forcing the metalworking workshop to cut nearly a quarter of the total output value plan. The parts supplied by the metalworking workshop to the assembly workshop were not complete sets and did not fully meet the specifications. The scraping hand plate required for assembling the 571Б gear shaving machine was only available in the metalworking workshop. The two parties could have staggered the time to exchange and use it, but the metalworking workshop refused. From the beginning of February to the 17th, they had not started assembling this gear shaving machine. Acting Factory Director Song Qian was so anxious that he had to personally go to the metalworking workshop to grab the tool. But it was too late, so he had to reduce the February assembly plan for this gear shaving machine by half.
    It wasn't that no one gave them advice. In addition to the Soviet experts being very concerned about production management and giving many opinions, the dozen or so domestic engineering and technical personnel of the Soviet expert comprehensive work group (including a deputy director of the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant) also gave positive opinions when assisting various departments in the factory. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the factory's management personnel were not modest at all, self-righteous, and did not respect the opinions of these people, even嫌these people were a nuisance! They usually did not pay attention to production management, and at the end of the month they worked overtime. In January, the overtime work hours approved by the deputy secretary of the Party committee and acting factory director exceeded 3,000 hours. Bai Zicheng, the director of the assembly workshop, also left his post of directing production and operated directly; the deputy secretary of the Party committee and the factory directors walked around the workshop day and night, or guarded the machine tools, urging the workers to speed up production. The deputy secretary of the Party committee promised to prohibit overtime work on the one hand, and on the other hand, adopted the method of Party committee deployment and branch nomination to mobilize technical section chiefs, section chiefs, and technicians to "voluntarily" support workshop production. The strange thing is that at the same time as working overtime, a group of technicians (some of whom were fourth-level or higher master craftsmen) who were transferred this year were idle and useless, which shows how chaotic the factory's management work was!
    The complacency and conservatism of the leaders are not only manifested in the failure to implement the experts' suggestions to improve management, but also in the lack of faith in the masses of workers. They dare not mobilize the masses, and do not explain the tasks to the workers at the beginning of the month, for fear that the masses will rise up and they will not be able to keep up. On February 18, Guo Ping, chairman of the Chongqing No. 1 Machinery Trade Union, had the following conversation with Acting Factory Director Song Qian:
    Song: "The production situation is very bad. The assembly workshop has a lot of tasks and few skilled workers."
    Guo: "I think mobilizing the masses can solve it."
    Song: "It's easy to say mobilize the masses, but what if the masses rise up and ask me for things?"
    Guo: "If the masses rise up, they will come up with solutions."
    Song: "Mobilizing the masses is right, but what if the plan is not completed after the masses rise up?"
    Guo: "Aren't the masses already up now? What are you worried about!"
    That afternoon, each workshop explained the tasks for February to the workers in detail, explaining the plan implementation situation. The workers then put forward guarantees to complete their own plans. The workers in the sub-assembly section and scraping team of the assembly workshop voluntarily offered to help the final assembly section install three 532 hobbing machines.
    Now, the three most favorable conditions for the Chongqing Machine Tool Plant to strive to achieve its challenge promise still exist. The key lies in the Party and administrative leaders of the enterprise learning from the vivid lessons since January, overcoming complacency and conservatism, relying on experts and workers, and improving production management.

### 为什么在挑战中掉了队

    为什么在挑战中掉了队
    本报记者　李策
    重庆机床厂在1月初向全国机床厂挑战，保证提前15个月完成第一个五年计划。但是，这个厂1月份只完成总产值计划的89.1％；完成商品产值计划的67.6％。2月份计划已经受到影响，3月份计划和上半年的新产品试制计划正受到威胁。
    职工们认为具备3个最有利的实现挑战的条件：一、今年成批生产，产品型号固定；二、有苏联专家帮助；三、工人劳动热情空前高涨。工人们也知道，成批生产以后，生产任务增加了，新工人和新设备增加了，生产上各个环节的衔接更加密切了。这一切，都要求管理工作紧紧地跟上去。
    但是，厂的领导人员和管理人员没有充分利用这些有利条件，也不重视生产上出现的新情况，不重视准备工作。他们只看到去年第四季度的生产任务增大，工时定额压缩了，新产品试制成功了，产品拿到国外去展览了，因而安于现状，不认真贯彻执行苏联专家建议，不积极改进管理。
    从去年10月初起，5位苏联专家先后帮助他们建立了三级责任制，编制了新工艺规程和工艺路线，针对各车间、科室技术和管理上的关键问题，以及今年生产准备工作，提出了一系列的建议。例如装配车间在零星生产时期，谈不到生产管理。专家建议把车间划分工段，实行流水作业；为了消除生产混乱现象，建议实行“三定” （定人、定工序、定地点）；为了防止返工，建议实行工序交验单，每道工序都进行严格检查。这都是实行全面技术改造，建立正常生产秩序的重大措施。但是，厂内不认真执行。1月份装配车间按照自己的办法把劳动组织大变动5次，装配返工现象十分严重，最后无路可走，才划分工段，实行流水作业。专家为金工车间编制的制造532滚齿机全套工艺规程，原定1月份执行48项，到2月20日，一项也没有执行。早在去年10月19日专家就根据今年生产情况，建议行政上趁早准备各种工具，但是他们满不在乎。1月份，金工车间缺少工具，工人们操纵新式车床，使用普通车刀和顶针，每分钟只转两百多转。厂长们、工会委员们走进车间，工人们向他们要工具。代理厂长宋谦平时只管下命令，不督促不检查，事到临头，才对工具股长说：“你害得我不敢下车间，一下车间，工人伸手向我要工具，你到底是怎么搞的？”
    党组织没有系统地向职工宣传苏联先进经验的优越性。职工们在执行专家建议，特别是碰到困难的时候，产生的各种不正确的思想行为，党组织也没有给予批判和纠正。
    1月份，锻工车间83％的工人突破了工时定额；金工车间64％的技工突破了新定额，有二分之一的小组提前完成了1月份计划。一个钳工小组完成计划153.44％。但是，这种高涨的劳动热情，没有产生应有的经济效果，主要原因是生产组织混乱，各单位的协作配合得不好。以金工车间来说，工具股不给足够的工具；铸造车间运来的铸件在加工中大量报废。更糟糕的是，劳动工资科事前没有按照需要调配足够的劳动力，逼得金工车间把总产值计划削掉将近四分之一。金工车间供给装配车间的配件不成套，不完全合规格。装配571Б剃齿机所需要的刮研手板，只有金工车间有一付，双方本来可以错开时间调换使用，但是金工车间不干。从2月初拖到17日，还没有动手装配这种剃齿机。代理厂长宋谦急得没法，才亲自到金工车间把这付工具抢来。但是时间已经晚了，只好把这种剃齿机的2月份装配计划减去一半。
    并不是没有人向他们提出忠告。除了苏联专家十分关心生产管理，提过很多意见以外，苏联专家综合工作组的十几位本国工程技术人员（其中有沈阳第二机床厂的一位副厂长），在厂内协助各部门工作的时候，也提过积极的意见。可惜这个厂的绝大部分管理人员很不虚心，自以为是，不尊重这些人的意见，甚至嫌这些人麻烦！他们平时不注意生产管理，月底就加班加点。1月份，经过党委副书记，代理厂长批准的加班工时达3，000小时以上。装配车间主任柏自诚也离开指挥生产的岗位，直接操作；党委副书记、厂长们不分白天黑夜在车间走来走去，或者守在机床跟前，督促工人加紧生产。党委副书记一面允诺禁止加班加点，一方面采取党委布置，支部提名的办法，动员有技术的科、股长、技术员，“自愿”支援车间生产。奇怪的是：就在加班加点的同时，今年调来的一批技工（一部分是四级以上的老师傅）竟闲着没用，可见这个厂的管理工作是多么混乱！
    领导人员自满保守，不只表现在不贯彻执行专家建议改进管理工作上面，也表现在不相信工人群众上面。他们不敢发动群众，月初不向工人交代任务，怕群众起来，自己跟不上。2月18日重庆市第一机械工会主席郭平跟代理厂长宋谦有这样一段谈话：
    宋：“生产情况很不好，装配车间任务大，熟练工人少。”
    郭：“我看发动群众就可以解决。”
    宋：“光说发动群众，群众起来了，跟我要东西怎么办？”
    郭：“群众起来了，就会想出办法。”
    宋：“发动群众也对，群众起来了，再完不成计划呢？”
    郭：“现在群众还没有起来吗，你愁什么！”
    当天下午各车间向工人具体交代了2月份的任务，说明计划执行情况。工人们就纷纷提出保证完成自己的计划。装配车间部装工段和刮研小组的工人们自动提出帮助总装工段安装三部532滚齿机。
    现在，重庆机床厂争取实现挑战诺言的三个最有利的条件还是存在的。关键在于企业的党和行政的领导人员吸取1月份以来活生生的教训，克服自满保守情绪，依靠专家和工人，改善生产管理工作。
