Let Consumers Choose Fabric Patterns Themselves
孔桑

On March 7th, the Liaoning Daily published a newsletter entitled "The Call of Fabric Pattern Designers," which stated that the fabric pattern designers of the Xiong Yue Printing and Dyeing Factory wanted to adorn the people of the motherland with novel and beautiful fabrics. To realize this ideal, they went to the mountains and fields, to the most beautiful places to learn from nature; to museums to learn from ancient artistic heritage; and learned from Chinese brocade and Soviet printed materials. However, when the fresh patterns they painstakingly designed were taken to the fabric selection meeting, the local textile company rejected them. They said: These patterns are too new, they are rarely used in cities, and farmers cannot accept them.

Are the fabric patterns created by the designers not beautiful, and are they really not welcomed by the masses? No. The designers once took a portion of the rejected fabric patterns and samples to an exhibition in Hezuo Village, Gaiping County, Liaoning Province. Many women looked at the samples and said: If the factory can produce such good fabrics, why does the cooperative always sell those old patterns? Designer Yin Guangsong designed a kind of full-background black silk fabric pattern that was quite elegant and generous. Depending on the printing and dyeing colors, it could be used to make children's clothing, or it could be used to make jackets for young women. Moreover, it uses less paste during printing and dyeing, which saves dye, and the printed fabric looks like velvet and feels like wool. However, this fabric was also rejected at the 1955 fabric selection meeting. The printing and dyeing factory "took a risk" to trial-produce a portion, and when it was taken to the store to sell, it became one of the best-selling fabrics.

The designers of the state-owned Tianjin Printing and Dyeing Factory also have the same troubles. The patterns they create every year are rejected because they are not recognized by the representative of the Hebei Provincial Textile Company's Tianjin office. These facts show that the practice of having a few people select fabric patterns is inappropriate. Fabrics are for the vast majority of consumers to make clothes. Consumers' preferences for the color and pattern of fabrics are varied and constantly changing. Someone may like one kind of fabric today, but tomorrow, when a new fabric comes out, they may like another kind. Therefore, which patterns and colors of fabrics to produce and which not to produce should be decided by the consumers themselves, and should not be decided by a few purchasing personnel of commercial departments, especially those who neither understand aesthetics nor understand consumers' preferences. Commercial departments in various places should open special counters or stores for trial sales of new products, specifically to introduce various new products to consumers, so that they have the opportunity to express their opinions. Consumers who like a certain pattern of fabric should ask the factory to produce that pattern; produce more of what consumers want more of, produce less of what they want less of, and eliminate what they don't want. By doing this, we can avoid the mistakes of subjectivism and conservatism made by a few purchasing personnel, and ensure that consumers can always buy satisfactory products.

### 让消费者自己选择花布图案

    让消费者自己选择花布图案
    孔桑
    3月7日，辽宁日报发表了一篇题为“花布设计人员的呼声”的通讯，说熊岳印染厂的花布图案设计人员都想用新颖美观的花布来把祖国人民打扮起来。为了实现这个理想，他们到山野里，到最幽美的地方去向大自然学习；到博物馆去向古代艺术遗产学习；从我国织锦中和苏联印花资料中学习。但是，他们辛辛苦苦地设计出来的新鲜图案，拿到花布评选会上，当地花纱布公司却不要。他们说：这些图案太新鲜，城市用得少，农民接受不了。
    是不是设计人员创造的花布图案不美观，真的不为群众所欢迎呢？不。设计人员曾把一部分落选的花布图案和样品拿到辽宁省盖平县合作村去展览。许多妇女看了样品后说：工厂里能生产这样好的花布，为什么合作社老卖那几种老花样呢？设计员尹光松设计一种满底黛绸花布图案相当雅致、大方，按印染颜色的不同，可以用来做儿童服装，也可以用来做年青妇女的夹袄，并且印染时用浆少，既节省染料，印出来的花布似绒似呢。但是，这种花布在1955年的花布评选会上也落选了。印染厂“冒险”试制了一部分，拿到商店去卖，却成为销路最好的一种花布。
    国营天津印染厂的设计人员也有同样的苦恼。他们每年所创造出来的花样，因为没得到河北省花纱布公司驻天津办事处的代表的认可而落选了。这些事实说明，由少数人来评选花布的花样图案的做法是不妥当的了。花布是给广大消费者做衣服穿的。消费者对花布的色泽、图案的爱好是各种各样的，而且是不断地变化着。有人今天喜爱这一种花布，明天新的花布出来以后，可能又喜爱另一种了。因此，生产哪一些图案色彩的花布，不生产哪一些图案色彩的花布，应该让消费者自己决定，而不应该由商业部门的少数采购人员，特别是那些既不懂得审美，又不了解消费者的爱好的人来决定。各地商业部门应该开设新产品试销专柜或门市部，专门向消费者介绍各种新产品，让他们有发表意见的机会。消费者喜欢哪一种花样的布，就要求工厂生产哪一种花样的布；消费者要得多的就多生产，要得少的就少生产，不要的就淘汰。这样做，才能避免少数采购人员犯主观主义和保守主义的毛病，才能保证消费者经常买到称心合意的产品。
