Guizhou Starts Construction on a Large Reservoir

    Guizhou Province's first and largest water conservancy project, the Guodi River Reservoir, has recently commenced full-scale construction, with all work scheduled for completion by the end of December this year. Upon completion, this reservoir will be able to store 10.5 million cubic meters of water, completely eliminating the threat of floods and droughts to more than 55,500 mu of farmland in eleven townships surrounding Xingyi County. Annual rice production can be increased by 9.8 million jin, meaning that the more than 35,000 farmers in these eleven townships can increase their income by an average of 280 jin of rice per person per year. It will also be possible to construct a hydroelectric power station using the reservoir's water storage capacity. Once the hydroelectric power station is built, half of the annual electricity generated will be sufficient to provide lighting for 8,000 households in the irrigated area.

    贵州动工兴修一个大水库
    贵州省第一个最大的水利工程锅底河水库，已经在最近全面动工兴修，全部工程计划在今年十二月底完工。这个水库建成后，可蓄水1，050万公方，将使兴义县城周围的十一个乡的55，500多亩田地全部免除水、旱灾害的威胁。每年可以增产稻谷980万斤，这十一个乡的三万五千多农民平均每人每年可增加280斤稻谷的收入。还可利用水库内的蓄水量兴修水电站。水电站修成后，每年所发电量的一半，就足够灌区内八千户农民照明用电。
