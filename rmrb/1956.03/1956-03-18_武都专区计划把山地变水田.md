Wudu Special District Plans to Turn Mountain Land into Paddy Fields

    In Gansu Province, mountain land accounts for more than 90% of the total cultivated land area in Wudu Special District. This year, Wudu Special District plans to build 105,000 mu of paddy fields, allowing more rice to grow on the high mountains. The Liaoyuan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dachuan District, Dangchang County of this special district spent 3,800 workdays building a reservoir, turning 84 mu of mountain land into paddy fields, which can increase grain production by more than 7,000 jin.

    In addition, Daping Village in Wuhuang Township, Wudu, is located on a hillside and never had a single mu of paddy field in the past, often suffering from drought and poor harvests. Now the whole village has a total of 117.5 mu of paddy fields. Under the influence of Daping Village, Yuhuangping, Huaishushan, Xiaoshijia, Zhangjiali and other villages are also vigorously building canals. This year, the whole township has converted 823.5 mu of mountain land into paddy fields, accounting for 12.2% of the total cultivated land area, greatly changing the past drought-stricken landscape.

    武都专区计划把山地变水田
    甘肃省武都专区的山地占总耕地面积90％以上。今年，武都专区计划兴修水地105，000亩，让更多的水稻生长在高山上。这个专区的宕昌县大川区燎原农业生产合作社花了3，800个劳动日，修了一个蓄水塘，把84亩山地变成水地，可以增产粮食7，000多斤。
    还有武都五皇乡大坪村位置在半山腰，从前没有一亩水地，经常受旱歉收。现在全村共有水地117.5亩。在大坪村的影响下，玉皇坪、槐树山、小石家、张家里等村也大力修渠。全乡今年有823.5亩山地变成水地，占总耕地面积的12.2％，大大地改变了过去的干旱面貌。
