Advanced Soviet Science and Technology

    **A Hundred Billion Electron Volt Synchrophasotron**

    The day is not far off when the synchrophasotron, a huge device for studying atomic nuclei, will begin to be used in the Soviet Union. The Soviet "Pravda" on March 18 devoted a large amount of space to a detailed introduction of this accelerator, which is currently being built by the Institute of Electronic Physics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.

    This accelerator can give protons—hydrogen nuclei—a kinetic energy of one hundred billion electron volts, and its speed will reach the speed of light, which is about 300,000 kilometers per second.

    This accelerator is very large. It uses the steel ridge of an electromagnet to enclose a huge circular plaza. The ring-shaped electromagnet on this accelerator weighs 36,000 tons and is almost 60 meters in diameter.

    V.I. Veksler, Director of the Institute of Electronic Physics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said in the article about the use of the accelerator that the most interesting and important task that Soviet physicists hope to solve with it is to understand the structure of the particles that form the basis of the atomic nucleus—protons and neutrons—and first of all to understand what is the connection between mesons, hyperons, and other recently discovered particles and the structure of protons and neutrons, what forces are at work between protons and neutrons, and what determines the stability of the existence of protons and neutrons.

    The establishment of the new synchrophasotron is a remarkable achievement in Soviet science and technology.

    Professor Yefremov pointed out in the article that when Soviet engineers began to realize the physicists' ideals and theoretical calculations, and began to turn these ideals and theoretical calculations into concrete structures, there was almost no experience in the world in designing and manufacturing such large accelerators. For our electrical engineers, radio technicians, and machine manufacturers, the task of manufacturing a 10 billion electron volt synchrophasotron was a serious test. It can be said that they have now completed this task.

    Professor Yefremov concluded by saying that the accumulated experience makes it possible to start designing larger accelerators that can obtain protons with a kinetic energy of 50 billion electron volts.

    **Semiconductors Replace Vacuum Tubes**

    In order to implement the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Leningrad "Svetlana" factory is preparing to start producing two types of semiconductor instruments in the second half of this year that can be widely used in radios and televisions.

    According to Katzman, the chief technologist of the factory and a Stalin Prize winner, semiconductor instruments can replace many vacuum tubes in radio engineering devices and automatic control instruments. The main advantage of semiconductor instruments is that a volume the size of a paper clip can be used for thousands of hours, and the required power is extremely small.

    **Kerosene Lamp Generator**

    The Soviet "Metallamp" factory has recently produced a "TFK II-II" type thermoelectric generator, which is a new type of kerosene lamp generator as it is commonly known. The electricity it generates is sufficient for Soviet-made "Motherland 47," "Spark" and other types of radios.

    The heat source of this generator is an ordinary kerosene lamp, and the lampshade has a thermoelectric battery made of semiconductors. After the kerosene lamp is lit, the battery heats up, but the outer end is still cold. Due to this temperature difference, an electric current is generated in a few minutes. However, the voltage of this current is low, and there is a special device to increase it to 80-132 volts, so that the radio can be turned on.

    **Solar Cooker**

    Last year, a team of Soviet scientists who went to the Karakum Desert in Turkmenistan for scientific research used a "solar cooker" to cook meals. This solar cooker is a new device designed by Soviet scholars to use solar energy. It consists of three parts: a concave mirror reflector, a heat receiver (pot, kettle, etc.), and a tripod as a support. The diameter of the reflector is about one meter. It focuses the sunlight on the heat receiver and is adjusted approximately every two or three hours.

    The solar cooker can boil five liters of water per hour, which is enough for a family of four or five people to cook meals. One solar cooker is equivalent to a 500-watt electric stove, and it can save about 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per year.

    **Exploration Work in the Arctic Region**

    In order to ensure the smooth navigation of the Soviet Northern Sea Route and further understand the natural conditions of the Arctic, there are now more than 100 polar scientific stations, observation stations, and "North Pole" drifting scientific stations conducting activities in various regions of the North. Their working conditions are very difficult and complex.

    Currently, the staff of the "North Pole 5" scientific station are engaged in heroic work on the ice floes in the central polar region. When the drift ice drifted at a speed of two kilometers per hour in the storm, they were still conducting observations to determine the friction at the junction of "ice and water". The scientific station is often suddenly hit by a gust of wind with a speed of 30 meters per second, which breaks the outer shell of the sounding balloon. Under the conditions of the polar night, they systematically observe the atmosphere 20 to 25 kilometers above the ground. It has now been determined that at an altitude of more than 12 to 15 kilometers, the temperature remains at around minus 75 to 80 degrees Celsius throughout the winter.

    Not long ago, the ice reconnaissance aircraft driven by Soviet hero N. Samushev completed a 35,000-kilometer reconnaissance flight. They observed the ice conditions in the Chukchi Sea, East Siberian Sea, Kara Sea, Barents Sea, and Laptev Sea.

    This year, the scale of Soviet Arctic exploration will be gradually expanded. According to plan, in addition to "North Pole 4" and "North Pole 5", a new ice floe scientific station "North Pole 6" will be established on an ice floe in the central polar region in April. Mobile scientific expeditions will conduct surveys at more than 500 locations in the central Arctic region. Automatic radio meteorological stations will be used in the central Arctic and the northern part of the Arctic Ocean to work without anyone participating.

    In addition, this year many oceanographic expeditions will be organized on some ships of the Soviet Arctic fleet to conduct comprehensive oceanographic surveys in the Greenland Sea. High-latitude aerial expeditions will also work in the Arctic in the spring.

    先进的苏联的科学和技术
    一百亿电子伏特的同步稳相加速器
    一种巨大的研究原子核的装置——同步稳相加速器在苏联开始使用的日子，已经不远了。三月十八日的苏联“真理报”以大量的篇幅对苏联科学院电子物理研究所现在正在建造的这种加速器作了详细的介绍。
    这种加速器能够使质子——氢原子核获得一百亿电子伏特的动能，它的速度将达到光的速度，即每秒钟约三十万公里。
    这种加速器非常庞大。它用电磁铁的钢脊围成一个巨大的圆形广场。这种加速器上的环形电磁铁重达三万六千吨，直径几乎达到六十公尺。
    苏联科学院电子物理研究所所长维克斯列尔在文章中谈到加速器的用途时说，苏联物理学家们希望用它解决的最有兴趣和最重要的任务，就是了解作为原子核基础的粒子——质子和中子——的构造情况，首先了解介子、超子和其它不久以前发现的粒子同质子和中子的结构有怎样的联系，质子和中子之间是什么力量在起作用，是什么决定了质子和中子存在的稳定性。
    新的同步稳相加速器的设立是苏联科学技术上的一个卓越的成就。
    叶夫雷莫夫教授在文章中指出，当苏联工程师着手实现物理学家的理想和理论计算，以及着手把这种理想和理论计算变为具体结构的时候，全世界还几乎没有设计制造这样大型的加速器的经验。对我们的电气技师、无线电技师和机器制造人员来说，制造一百亿电子伏特的同步稳相加速器的任务曾经是一个严重的考验。可以说，他们现在已经完成了这个任务。
    叶夫雷莫夫教授最后说，积累的经验使得现在能够着手设计更大型的、可以得到具有五百亿电子伏特动能的质子的加速器。
    半导体代替真空管
    列宁格勒“斯维特兰那”工厂为了贯彻苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的决议，准备在今年下半年开始生产两种可以广泛用在收音机和电视机上的半导体仪器。
    据这个工厂的总工艺技师、斯大林奖金获得者卡茨曼说，半导体仪器可以代替很多无线电工程装置和自动操纵仪表中的真空管。半导体仪器的主要优点就是，像回形针那样大小的体积可以用数千小时，而且所需的电是极少的。
    煤油灯发电器
    苏联“金属灯”工厂最近制出了一种“TFK二—二”型温差电发电器，就是一种新的、通常说的煤油灯发电器。它所发出的电足以供苏联制的“祖国四七”、“火花”等型收音机应用。
    这种发电器的热能来源就是一个普通的煤油灯，灯罩上有半导体制的温差发电池。煤油灯点火以后，电池发热，但外面一端还是冷的，由于这种温差，不到几分钟就产生电流。不过这种电流的电压较低，还有一种专门装置把它提高到八十—一百三十二伏特，这样就可以使收音机响起来了。
    太阳灶
    去年到土库曼卡拉库姆沙漠作科学研究工作的一队苏联科学家，应用了“太阳灶”来作饭吃。这种太阳灶是苏联学者设计的一种利用太阳能的新装置，它由三部分组成：凹面镜的反射器，热力接收器（锅、壶等物）和作为支柱的三角架。反射器的直径约一公尺多。它把太阳光的焦点集中在热力接收器上，大约每二、三小时调整一次。
    太阳灶每小时可以烧开五公升的水，可以供有四、五个人的家庭作饭之用。一个太阳灶就等于五百瓦的电炉，利用它每年大约可以节省一千度的电力。
    在北极地区的考察工作
    为了保证苏联北方海路运输干线的顺利通航和进一步了解北极自然状况，现在苏联有一百多个极地科学站、观测站、“北极”漂浮科学站在北方各个不同的地区进行活动。它们的工作条件是十分困难和复杂的。
    目前，“北极五号”科学站上的工作人员正在中心极区的浮冰上进行着英勇的劳动。当浮冰在暴风中漂流速度达到每小时二公里的时候，他们还在进行观察，以确定在“冰和水”交界处的摩擦力。科学站上经常突然刮来一阵每秒速度达到三十公尺的大风，吹破了探测气球外壳。在极地夜的条件下，他们系统地观察离地面二十到二十五公里的大气层。现在已经确定，在十二到十五公里以上的高空，几乎在整个冬季，气温都保持在零下七十五度到八十度左右。
    不久以前，苏联英雄恩·萨穆谢夫驾驶的冰上侦察飞机结束了三万五千公里的侦察飞行。他们观察了楚克奇海、东西伯利亚海、喀拉海、巴伦支海和拉普底夫海的浮冰情况。
    今年，苏联北极考察工作规模，将陆续扩大。按照计划，除了“北极四号”和“北极五号”外，四月间将在中心极区的一块浮冰上设立一个新的浮冰科学站“北极六号”。流动科学考察队将在北极中部地区的五百多个地点进行考察。在北极中部和北极海的北部将使用自动的无线电气象站，在没有人参加下进行工作。
    此外，今年苏联北极船队的一些船只上将组织许多海洋考察队，在格陵兰海进行全面海洋学考察。高纬度的空中考察队也将在春天在北极进行工作。
