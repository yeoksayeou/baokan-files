The Advanced Producer Movement in Nanjing State-Owned Enterprises
Shi Yue'e

    Beginning on the first day of this year, state-owned enterprises in Nanjing launched a comprehensive labor emulation campaign and advanced producer movement to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. New quotas are constantly being broken, new records are continuously emerging, the ranks of advanced producers are constantly expanding, and a large number of rationalization proposals are appearing. According to preliminary statistics from 30 factories with more than 100 employees, 2,003 rationalization proposals were put forward in January alone. These suggestions have played a certain role in overcoming the weak links in the factories. In the past, the electric porcelain factory could only fire one kiln of quartz stone per day in its horizontal kiln, with an output of only two to three tons. Xin Yinsen, a Communist Party member, suggested lengthening the kiln body and changing from one-sided firing to two-sided firing, which could double the output.

    Since December of last year, many factories have formulated comprehensive plans to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. According to statistics from 26 state-owned and jointly state-private factories, the output value in 1956 will increase by 60% compared to 1955, and by more than 50% in 1957 compared to 1956. Generally, state-owned enterprises can achieve the 1957 targets in 1956 without increasing equipment or manpower. Some factories can complete or over fulfill the cumulative output value task of the Five-Year Plan by the end of 1956. Labor productivity, cost reduction, and profit delivery plans have also been correspondingly increased. The Nanjing Machine Tool Factory implemented new work-hour quotas from January 15th. By March 5th, all workers had broken the quotas, and the labor productivity in January was equivalent to 227% of the same period last year. Workers in the No. 1 rotary kiln group of the Jiangnan Cement Plant have mastered advanced experience such as rapid kiln rotation and water cooling. By the end of February, they had created a new record of 377 days of operation, and the average hourly output reached the highest level of rotary kilns of the same diameter in the country. Workers in the electrical workshop of the Xiaguan Power Plant have long been conscientiously implementing safe operating procedures, and based on equipment and past operating conditions, they have formulated systems such as "operation supervision," "patrol inspection," and "safety record manual," creating a new record of 1317 days of safe operation.

    Learning from the advanced, helping the backward, and jointly improving technology are characteristics of this advanced producer movement. The machining workshop of the Nanjing Machine Tool Factory was originally the weakest link in the entire factory, with many defective products and low output. The factory specially invited advanced producers from outside the factory to perform eight advanced experiences such as high-speed cutting, and organized technicians to assist workers in learning. In addition, with the conscientious implementation of the German experts' suggestions, the production efficiency of the machining workshop increased three times, and the defect rate dropped from 1% to 0.3%, ensuring the comprehensive completion of the national plan. In the machining workshop, Sha Jianxun, a third-grade milling worker and member of the Communist Youth League, took the initiative to pass on new technologies to Yang Fengchun, a fourth-grade milling worker, helping him improve his operations and break new quotas. In the past, worker Liu Guohua consistently produced many defective products and failed to meet quotas. When implementing the new quotas, the workshop staff specially organized advanced workers to help him, so that both his output and quality met the quota requirements. In the advanced producer movement, engineering and technical personnel put forward many valuable suggestions and actively helped workers solve important key problems. Jiang Zhiquan, chief engineer of the Nanjing Chemical Plant, studied the production capacity required for antioxidant Ding and proposed that by simply adding two reaction pots, the production of antioxidant Ding could be increased by 4.7 times compared to 1955, meeting the needs of the rubber industry's development within the Five-Year Plan. Thanks to the initiative of technical personnel, this factory can advance the production of 12 new products originally planned for next year to this year without increasing equipment. Wu Jingguang, head of the production technology section, has successfully studied the use of base powder sodium to manufacture insecticides for cotton aphids. In the past, insecticides for cotton aphids were produced using p-nitrobenzene. Now, using base powder sodium for manufacturing can save a large amount of p-nitrobenzene, increasing the country's income by 3.6 million yuan annually.

    However, in this advanced producer movement, the leadership of individual enterprises is satisfied with the increase in output, neglecting product quality, and neglecting off-site collaboration. Recently, the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has sounded the alarm for various enterprises, organized enterprise leaders to criticize complacency, overcome departmentalism, and further mobilize the masses to push the movement to a new high.

    南京市国营企业的先进生产者运动
    史越峨
    从今年的第一天开始，南京市的国营企业展开了全面提前完成五年计划的劳动竞赛和先进生产者运动。新的定额不断被突破，新纪录不断出现，先进生产者的队伍不断扩大，各种合理化建议大量出现。据30个具有100人以上的工厂的初步统计，1月份就提出了2，003件合理化建议。这些建议对克服工厂的薄弱环节都有一定的作用。电瓷厂烧石英卧窑，过去每天只能烧一窑，产量只有二、三吨，共产党员辛银森建议把窑身改长，一面烧改为二面烧，产量可以增加一倍。
    从去年12月起，许多工厂都订出了提前完成五年计划的全面规划。据国营、中央公私合营26个厂的统计，1956年的产值比1955年增长60％，1957年又比1956年增长50％以上。一般国营企业在不增加设备和人力的条件下，1956年都可以达到1957年的指标，有些工厂到1956年底就可以完成或超额完成五年计划的累计产值任务。劳动生产率、降低成本和上缴利润计划也相应地提高。南京机床厂从1月15日起贯彻执行新的工时定额，到3月5日，所有的工人都突破了定额，1月份的劳动生产率相当于去年同期的227％。江南水泥厂一号旋窑组工人们掌握快速转窑和水冷却等先进经验，至2月底已经创造了运转377天的新纪录，平均时产量也达到全国同样直径的旋窑的最高水平。下关电厂电气车间的工人们，长期认真执行安全操作规程，并且根据设备和过去操作情况，订出了“操作监护”、“巡回检查”、“安全写实手册”等制度，创造了安全运行1317天的新纪录。
    学习先进，帮助落后，共同提高技术，是这次先进生产者运动的一个特点。南京机床厂加工车间原是全厂最薄弱的环节，废品多，产量低。工厂专门请厂外的先进生产者来厂表演高速切削等八项先进经验，并且组织技术人员协助工人学习。再加上认真执行德国专家的建议，加工车间的生产效率就提高三倍，废品率由1％降低到0.3％，保证了国家计划的全面完成。在加工车间里，青年团员三级铣工沙建勋，主动把新技术传授给四级铣工杨逢春，帮助他改进操作，突破新定额。工人刘国华过去一贯废品多，达不到定额，在贯彻执行新定额的时候，车间工作人员专门组织先进工人帮助他，使他的产量和质量都达到了定额要求。在先进生产者运动中，工程技术人员提出了很多有重大价值的建议，积极帮助工人解决重要关键问题。南京化工厂总工程师江知权研究了防老剂丁的生产需要能力，提出只要增加两个反应锅，可使防老剂丁比1955年增产四点七倍，满足五年计划内橡胶工业发展的需要。由于技术人员发挥了积极性，这个厂在不增加设备的条件下，可以把原计划在明后年生产的12种新产品提前到今年生产。生产技术科长吴景光研究利用基粉纳制造棉蚜虫的杀虫剂已经成功。过去棉蚜虫的杀虫剂都是用对硝基生产的，现在用基粉纳制造，可以节省大量对硝基，全年可为国家增加收入360万元。
    但是，在这一次先进生产者运动中，个别企业的领导工作满足于产量的增加，忽视产品质量，忽视厂外的协作。最近，中共南京市委已经给各企业敲起警钟，组织企业领导人员批判自满情绪，克服本位主义思想，进一步发动群众，把运动推向新的高涨。
