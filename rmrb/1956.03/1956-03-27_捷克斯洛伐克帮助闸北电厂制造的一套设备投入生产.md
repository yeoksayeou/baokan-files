Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 26th: The first and largest thermal power generating equipment that the Czechoslovak Republic aided China with officially went into production in Shanghai on the 24th.

At 3:00 PM, the ribbon-cutting ceremony was held in the newly expanded factory building of the Zhabei Power Plant under the Shanghai Electric Power Administration. Shanghai Vice Mayor Cao Diqiu cut the ribbon in front of the huge, operating steam turbine generator.

The Ambassador of the Czechoslovak Republic to China, Mr. Grigor, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing to attend the ribbon-cutting ceremony and attended the celebration meeting held in the power plant's auditorium.

This set of power generating equipment, including boilers, steam turbine generators, power output equipment, and auxiliary equipment, was specifically designed and manufactured by the Czechoslovak Republic to suit the expansion conditions of the Zhabei Power Plant. It is of a novel design, highly efficient, and has a complete automatic protection device and many automatic control devices. During the design and year-long construction process, 41 Czechoslovak experts came to the site to preside over and guide the equipment installation and personally operate it.

The commissioning of this new equipment has increased the power generation capacity of the Zhabei Power Plant by nearly half. The Czechoslovak Republic also helped the Zhabei Power Plant replace all of its original, under-capacity oil switches with the latest compressed air switches, and improved the water treatment equipment and many other technical equipment not belonging to this expansion project.

At the celebration meeting on the 24th, Li Zhong, Director of the Shanghai Electric Power Administration, delivered a speech, thanking the Czechoslovak Republic for its fraternal assistance. He said: The commissioning of this set of power generating equipment that the Czechoslovak Republic helped Shanghai expand is a strong support for the Shanghai city workers who are striving to complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and the Shanghai suburban farmers who are building an electric irrigation network.

Representatives of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry of the People's Republic of China, the Shanghai Electric Power Administration, and all staff and workers of the Zhabei Power Plant presented banners to all Czechoslovak experts at the celebration meeting.

Shanghai Vice Mayor Cao Diqiu held a celebration banquet in the evening to entertain Ambassador Grigor and all the experts.
