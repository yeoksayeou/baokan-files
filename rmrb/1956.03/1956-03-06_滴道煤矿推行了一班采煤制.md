    Didao Coal Mine Implements One-Shift Coal Mining System
    By Our Correspondent Fang Qing

    Mine production generally operates on a three-shift system, meaning eight hours per shift, with three shifts comprising a 24-hour cycle. In the past, Chinese mines mainly used a two-shift coal mining, one-shift preparation system. With the increasing level of mechanized operations underground, the Soviet Union introduced a one-shift coal mining system, which involves two shifts of preparation and one shift of coal mining. The one-shift coal mining system now adopted by the Second Inclined Shaft of the Second Administrative Pit of the Didao Coal Mine under the Jixi Mining Bureau is one of the advanced experiences in Soviet coal mine management.

    Why is cutting the coal mining time by half considered an advanced experience? To understand this, I visited Director Li of the Didao Coal Mine. He described the work situation at the Second Inclined Shaft as follows: According to the coal seam structure, they are currently mining at the 17th and 18th seams, each with a coal face using a coal cutter. The working face is 82 meters long, and the coal seam is 90 centimeters to 1 meter thick. The task in this coal face is to advance forward along the 82-meter-long, 1-meter-high coal wall. To extract the coal here, a series of preparatory works must be done: before starting operation, a space for the workers must be created by densely supporting the rock layer above with pit props to prevent collapse. Near the winch track, stone piers are also built to support the rock. Next, the coal cutter is moved and repaired, and then coal cutting begins. That is, the coal cutter extends 1.8 meters into the coal wall from the lowest layer, cutting a gap, and then coal chutes for transportation are laid. After that, holes are drilled and blasted in the upper layer of the coal wall to break the coal down, which can then be transported via the coal chutes to one end of the coal face, loaded onto coal cars, and transported away. This counts as one cycle. When work resumes the next day, the coal face is cleaned again, and as the coal wall advances, the support is continued, the coal cutter is placed, and the coal chutes are laid… This enters the second cycle.

    Looking at this operational sequence: the so-called coal mining time is only from the start of blasting until the coal wall collapses, after which coal chutes are used to transport the coal out. Most of the time is spent on moving and repairing machinery, transporting timber, supporting pillars, building stone piers, and drilling holes. This series of preparatory work is complex and meticulous, and even the slightest carelessness can directly affect coal mining. Therefore, it is perfectly reasonable to spend two-thirds of the time on preparation.

    In the past, when the Second Inclined Shaft of the Second Administrative Pit of the Didao Coal Mine used two-shift coal mining, the quality of work was not guaranteed due to insufficient preparation time. Rock collapse accidents occurred because the supports were not properly installed; the coal cutters often malfunctioned during operation because there was not enough time for maintenance. The two coal mining shifts each took care of their own tasks and were unrelated to each other. On the 80-meter-long working face, each shift would work on 40 meters, with each shift doing its own cutting, blasting, and transportation. Dividing a complete task into two shifts was both time-consuming and labor-intensive. For example, after blasting, there must be a certain ventilation time to bring in fresh air to replace the gunpowder smell and the coal dust. The more blasting, the longer the ventilation time. Each coal mining shift, as long as using coal chutes for transportation, must have someone watching the chute opening to accurately load the coal onto the coal cars. Two-shift coal mining required two people to watch, but if the coal mining time is compressed into one shift, one person can do the job perfectly well. To expand the scope a little further, after the coal from the 17th and 18th seam coal faces is loaded, it must go through the same winch track. In the past, they used two-shift coal mining, and there were only three shifts per day, so no matter what, there would always be one shift where both faces were mining at the same time. As a result, the two coal mining faces often competed for coal cars and winch tracks, and the shift foreman had to come to the car yard to mediate disputes, even spending the entire shift in the car yard. After implementing the one-shift coal mining system, not only was this contradiction resolved, but they also planned to open another coal face to jointly use this winch track.

    During the implementation of the one-shift coal mining system, the Party committee closely focused on conducting collectivist education. In the past, with two-shift coal mining, each shift only cared about producing more coal in their own shift, sometimes disregarding working conditions and not preparing conditions for the next shift. Now it's different; the two preparation shifts are creating conditions for the coal mining shift. The first preparation shift has to transport pit props, and some of them are for use by the other two shifts; the second preparation shift drills holes, and they must also master the angle and distance so that the coal can be accurately broken up when the coal mining shift blasts. The coal mining shift tries to mine as much coal as possible, and the results are shared by all three shifts. After clarifying this relationship, it has been fully proven in practice that there is no more competition between them. Instead, everyone links the work they are responsible for with the overall effect of increasing the coal mining rate, with dozens of people working towards a common goal.

    These two coal faces began implementing the one-shift coal mining system in May 1955. By December, the number of personnel had been reduced from 114 to 94; the coal mining efficiency per worker increased from about 3 tons to about 4 tons, and the cost was reduced by about 14% compared to the plan. The coal faces are very neat and clean, and accidents have been greatly reduced.

    Under what conditions can the one-shift coal mining system be implemented?

    Director Li said that the one-shift coal mining system can be implemented in all coal faces where the coal seam inclination does not exceed 45 degrees, the working face is from 50 meters to 150 meters, and pit props are used for support. In addition to the above natural conditions, there must also be realistic operating procedures, operations according to cycle charts, various business management systems, and very strict labor discipline. In other words, to implement the one-shift coal mining system, the level of enterprise management must be raised a step further. Didao Coal Mine is the best mine for learning the advanced Soviet management experience of the one-meter layer. Director Li said that if the advanced Soviet management experience of the one-meter layer is implemented first, it will lay a solid foundation for the implementation of the one-shift coal mining system. Didao Coal Mine plans to implement the one-shift coal mining system in 16 coal faces this year. Director Li believes that most of the coal faces in other mines are also capable of implementing the one-shift coal mining system.

### 滴道煤矿推行了一班采煤制

    滴道煤矿推行了一班采煤制
    本报记者  方青
    矿井里的生产一般都是三班制，就是8小时一个工作班，一昼夜分三班，算作一个循环。我国矿井过去都是两班采煤，一班准备。随着井下机械化作业程度的提高，苏联推行了一班采煤制，就是两班准备，一班采煤。现在鸡西矿务局滴道煤矿第二行政坑二斜井采用的一班采煤制，就是苏联煤矿管理的先进经验之一。
    为什么把采煤时间缩短了一半，反而成了先进经验呢？为了弄清这个问题，我访问了滴道煤矿的李矿长。他这样介绍二斜井的工作情况：按煤层的构成，目前正采到17层18层，各有一个用截煤机的采煤场子。工作面有82公尺，煤层从90公分到1公尺厚。这个采煤场子，就是在82公尺长1公尺高的煤壁上向前推进。为要把这里的煤拿出来，得作好一系列的准备工作：没有操作之前，得先创造容身的场所，就是用很密集的坑木把头顶的岩石层支撑起来，以免塌陷。在靠近绞车道的地方，还要垒石垛支撑岩石。接着便搬运和检修截煤机，并开始截煤。就是用截煤机从煤壁的最下层伸进1.8公尺，割出一道缝隙，再铺设运输用的煤溜子，这才在煤壁上层钻孔、爆破，把煤崩落下来，就可以从煤溜子上输送到煤壁的一端，装上煤车运走。这算是一个循环。第二天再开始工作的时候，又重新清理采煤场子，并且跟着煤壁的前进，继续向前支柱，安置截煤机铺设煤溜子……这就又进入第二个循环了。
    按着这个操作顺序看：所谓采煤的时间，只不过是从爆破开始，煤壁塌落后，就用煤溜子把煤运出来。另外，需要大部分时间去作移置和检修机器、运输木材、支柱、垒石垛钻孔等等。这一系列的准备工作，既繁杂又细致，稍一疏忽就会直接影响采煤。所以，用三分之二的时间作准备是完全合理的。
    滴道煤矿的第二行政坑二斜井过去两班采煤的时候，由于准备时间不够，工作质量没有保证。因为支柱没有弄好，发生过岩石塌落事故；截煤机没有充分时间检修，又经常在操作的时候发生故障。两个采煤班各顾各，互不相关。在80公尺长的工作面上，每一班干40公尺，各班自己截煤、爆破、运输，把一套完整的工作分成两班作，既浪费时间，又浪费人力。比如爆破之后，要有一定的通风时间，把好空气抽进来，代替火药味和飞扬的煤粉。爆破的次数多了，通风的时间就会延长。每个采煤班，只要是用煤溜子运输，这个溜子口上就必须有一个人看管，把溜下来的煤准确地装到煤车上。两班采煤必须由两人看管，如果把采煤时间压缩到一个工作班，一个人也完全可以作好。再把范围扩大一点，17层18层这两个采煤场子的煤装车以后，得走同一条绞车道。他们过去都是两班采煤，而每一昼夜只有三个班次，不管怎样，总有一个班次是两个场子同时采煤。因此，两个采煤场子常常互相争车皮，争绞车道，值班班长只好到车场子里来调解纠纷，甚至整个工作班都呆在车场子里。推行了一班采煤制以后，不仅这个矛盾解决了，而且他们计划再开辟一个采煤场子，来共同使用这条绞车道。
    在推行一班采煤制的过程中，党委抓紧进行了集体主义的教育。因为过去两班采煤是各顾各，只管本班多出煤，有时就不顾工作条件，不为下班准备条件。现在不同了，两个准备班，都是为采煤班创造条件。第一准备班要运输坑木，就有一部分给其他两个班用；第二准备班钻孔，也要把角度、距离掌握好，这是为采煤班爆破的时候能够准确地把煤崩碎；而采煤班尽量多采煤，成绩又是三个班所共有的。把这个关系弄清楚以后，在操作中完全证明了：互相间再不争夺了，而是每个人都把自己担任的工作和提高采煤率的总效果联系起来，几十个人为了一个共同的目的。
    这两个采煤场子从1955年5月开始实行一班采煤制，到12月份为止，人员从114人减到94人；每一个工的采煤效率，从3吨左右提高到4吨左右，成本比计划降低14％左右。采煤场子很整齐、干净，事故大大减少。
    在什么样的条件下才能实行一班采煤制呢？
    李矿长说，凡是煤层倾斜程度不超过45度，从50公尺到150公尺的工作面，而又是用坑木支柱的采煤场子，都能推行一班采煤制。除去以上自然条件外，还要有切合实际的作业规程，按循环图表操作，有各种经营管理制度，劳动纪律非常严格。也就是说，实行一班采煤制，就必须把企业管理水平提高一步。滴道煤矿是学习一公尺层苏联先进管理经验最好的矿。李矿长说，如果先实行了一公尺层苏联先进管理经验，就给推行一班采煤制奠定了坚强的基础。滴道煤矿今年准备在16个采煤场子里推行一班采煤制。李矿长认为其他矿的大部分采煤场子，也是能够实行一班采煤制的。
