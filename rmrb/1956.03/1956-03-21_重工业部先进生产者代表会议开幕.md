Wang Heshou, Minister of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, delivered a report at today's meeting. He requested that advanced producers in various enterprises earnestly lead all employees and strive to catch up with the advanced countries in various major aspects of the steel, non-ferrous metal, chemical, and building materials industries within a certain period of time.

In his report, Wang Heshou cited many vivid examples to illustrate that learning new technologies and promoting advanced experiences are important methods to ensure the early completion of the Five-Year Plan. In the past three years, workers in various enterprises under the Ministry of Heavy Industry, due to learning new technologies and promoting advanced experiences, have increased the country's production by millions of tons of steel and millions of tons of cement and chemical fertilizers with very little additional equipment, and have increased hundreds of new products. Of the total output increase planned by the Ministry of Heavy Industry in 1956 compared to 1952, 37% can only be achieved after mobilizing workers to earnestly learn and promote new technologies and advanced experiences. Wang Heshou said that thousands of advanced producers have played a great role in learning and promoting new technologies and experiences. In the future, they should make greater achievements in production and construction together with the broad masses of workers, and help other workers reach advanced levels.

Before Wang Heshou's report, Dong Xin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Wang Wei, representative of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, Wu Yushu, Beijing Agricultural Labor Model and Deputy Director of the Heping Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing, and representatives of Soviet experts from the Ministry of Heavy Industry, all spoke successively to congratulate the advanced producers attending the meeting.

    重工业部先进生产者代表会议开幕
    新华社20日讯　重工业部第一届先进生产者代表会议今天在北京开幕。这次会议的主要任务，是表扬先进人物，交流先进经验，进一步组织广大职工开展先进生产者运动，在职工中掀起学习新技术和推广先进经验的热潮，保证提前完成第一个五年计划。
    出席今天会议的有从重工业部生产、建筑安装、地质、设计等企业单位评选出来的先进人物和先进单位的代表869人。其中，有三年中给国家多生产三万多吨钢的鞍钢八号模范平炉的代表王守文；有计划在今年内完成两年工作量的鞍钢青年工具车间的代表、著名劳动模范王崇伦；有用两年零八个月时间完成四年工作量的龙烟铁矿模范掘进小组代表白栓宝；有五年来创造二十多种先进施工工具的抹灰小组代表、著名劳动模范杨德重；有和工人密切结合、采用先进方法提高“六六六”农药质量的天津化工厂技术员茹膺；有积极学习苏联先进经验、提前完成一项重大工程设计任务的黑色冶金设计院工程师陈岱；有曾经领导职工试制成功六种新品种水泥的建筑材料工业综合研究所工程师左万信等。此外，还有企业中优秀的行政管理人员、医务人员、保育人员和炊事人员。
    重工业部部长王鹤寿在今天会议上作了报告。他要求各企业的先进生产者，认真带动全体职工，争取在一定时期内，使钢铁、有色金属、化学和建筑材料工业，在各个主要方面赶上先进国家的水平。
    王鹤寿在报告中，举出许多生动的事例，说明学习新技术和推广先进经验，是保证提前完成五年计划的重要方法。三年来，重工业部各企业职工由于学习新技术和推广先进经验，在很少增添设备的情况下，为国家增产了成百万吨钢铁和上百万吨水泥和化学肥料，并且增加了几百种新的产品。重工业部1956年计划比1952年增加的总产量中，有37％是必须发动职工认真学习、推广新技术和先进经验后才能达到的。王鹤寿说，成千上万的先进生产者，在学习和推广新的技术经验方面起了很大作用。今后，更应该在生产和建设中同广大职工一起做出更大成绩，并且帮助其他职工达到先进水平。
