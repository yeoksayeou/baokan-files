Report on the Work of Literature of Brotherly Nationalities
—Report (Abstract) at the Second Council Meeting (Enlarged) of the Chinese Writers Association
Lao She

After the May Day Labor Day in 1955, the Chinese Writers Association invited eleven comrades from eight brotherly nationalities—Yi, Dong, Zhuang, Dongxiang, Uygur, Mongolian, Miao, and Korean (Yanbian)—and two Han comrades familiar with the literature of brotherly nationalities to Beijing to discuss the literary work of brotherly nationalities.

Now, let us discuss the situation and problems of the literary work of brotherly nationalities according to the materials provided by this symposium:

(A) National Literary Heritage and the Rise of New Literature:

Among the nationalities with writing systems, such as the Mongolian, Uyghur, and Tibetan, all have long literary traditions.

The creation of the Mongolian epic "The Story of Geser" predates Genghis Khan's appearance on the historical stage by two centuries! This is a beautiful and magical people's literary work that should be included in the world's cultural treasury.

The epic "Janggar," which was created in the early 15th century and composed of twelve long songs, is also a giant work passed down orally by the people and is still widely circulated among the Mongolian people.

In addition to these two major epics, there are many other works circulating among the people.

Today, new literature is also growing. The poems of Na. Sayin Chogtu and Ba. Burenbehr, and the novels and plays of Punsuk, Odsur, Malaqinfu, Chogtu Narin, etc. are all welcomed and praised by readers.

The Uyghur, Kazakh, and Uzbek nationalities in Xinjiang are comparable to the Mongolian nationality in terms of literary heritage. The "Towaduwa" printed in the Soviet Union in the 3rd and 4th centuries and the "Qisatani Ilik Bek" in the 6th and 7th centuries are both valuable heritages that existed before the introduction of Islam. The "Kutadgu Bilig" of the 12th century is an important epic of the Uyghur nationality. In addition, the long poems of Navai, who represents the great historical period of Uyghur and Uzbek literature, and the works of Abai, the father of Kazakh literature, are all from Xinjiang and are also valuable assets that constitute the cultural history of the motherland.

Influenced by the October Revolution and the May Fourth Movement, various ethnic groups in Xinjiang began to pursue democratic literature, and many writers and poets emerged. Since liberation, the Uyghur and Kazakh ethnic groups have produced many relatively excellent works in literary and artistic creation. Poets Tieyifu Jiang and Buhara are working tirelessly on creation, and Zunun Hadir and others have also made good achievements in short stories and plays.

Tibetan literature began to rise in the 9th century, developed around the 12th century, and flourished around the 17th century. The important literary heritage of the Tibetan nationality includes the epic "The Legend of King Gesar". This famous work was written in the late Yuan and early Ming dynasties, has high literary value, is widely circulated among the people, has been adapted into operas, and has also been used as a theme for murals.

In terms of lyric poetry, there are the most widely circulated lyric songs written by the Sixth Dalai Lama, Tsangyang Gyatso. The Tibetan people still recite his works to this day. In novels, the biographical novel "The Life of Milarepa" has the value of world literature. This work has been translated into English, French, Japanese, Mongolian, and Chinese. Tibetan folk literature is also rich and colorful.

Now, many new intellectuals have emerged in Tibet and have begun to create literary works reflecting new life based on excellent literary traditions.

In recent years, the emerging literature of the Korean nationality in Yanbian has made considerable achievements in both poetry and prose. In addition to scripts and novels, writers have also paid attention to compiling folk tales and storytelling arts.

Gansu, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi are all multi-ethnic provinces. Many ethnic groups do not have writing systems, but the literature preserved orally is rich and colorful. Each ethnic group has many beautiful poems.

(B) Carry out Collection, Collation, and Research Work:

Judging from the literary heritage of the above-mentioned brotherly nationalities, whether written down or circulated orally, they are so rich! Moreover, what we are based on is only some of the materials provided by the comrades who participated in the symposium, and not all the materials of the literature of the brotherly nationalities. We have a responsibility to collect and collate these valuable materials so that they can become the cultural wealth of all of China!

How to collect it? We would like to offer some suggestions: (1) Collection work must follow national policies. (2) Collection work is meticulous, patient, and long-lasting work. The history and social background of the nation cannot be understood in a short period of time, and these are the important factors that constitute literary works. If we are not careful and do not understand deeply, we will miss the essence or regard the dross as the essence, and spread false information. In order to deeply understand oral poetry, we must also pay attention to the music and dance that accompany it. (3) Collection work is also mass work. Collectors should go deep into life, establish good relations with the masses, and "give and take" in order to get good things.

There are also several points to pay attention to in sorting and research: (1) It is best to carry out the sorting work locally, so that more help and more reference materials can be obtained at any time. It is also very beneficial to discuss with the local people after sorting. (2) For classical literary works, we must use the Marxist-Leninist historical viewpoint and class viewpoint to analyze and judge their ideological content and determine what to take and what to discard. (3) In the process of collecting and sorting, we will also encounter some incompleteness in written records or oral legends. We should not add to this casually! Also: The language structure and grammar of brotherly nationalities have their own characteristics, and we should not easily exert the imagination of the collator and add or subtract them casually. (4) Long poems and legends that are retained orally often have several different versions of the same story, which requires extremely meticulous research and careful judgment. The primary task is to consider the problem from the historical and social background of the nation, and not to subjectively consider it from the psychology of the nation to which the collector belongs.

(C) Now let's talk about translation issues:

Translation is a key issue. Without translation, there would be no literary exchange between nationalities.

Translation can be divided into three categories: various nationalities translating Han Chinese literature, Han Chinese translating various nationalities' literature, and various nationalities translating each other.

The comrades of various ethnic groups who participated in the symposium unanimously stated that they urgently need to translate Han Chinese literature in order to absorb advanced experience. Mongolian, Uyghur, and Korean ethnic groups have translated some Han Chinese literary works, but they still feel that it is not enough. Through the translation of Han Chinese literature, various nationalities have the possibility of producing new literary forms and genres. What is particularly urgent is the translation of literary theory—literary theory written by Han Chinese and translated from Soviet literature. Without the study of theory, creation is not easy to improve. This is an important issue! On the one hand, we must pay attention to cultivating translators, and on the other hand, we also need to cooperate with Han Chinese writers. People from brotherly nationalities who translate Han Chinese literary works should have the opportunity to meet with the original authors and discuss the translated drafts together.

The work of translating the literature of various nationalities into Han Chinese has gradually become active with the implementation of national policies. The collation and translation of beautiful long poems like "Ashima" are worthy of praise. Certain achievements have also been made in the collection of folk songs of various nationalities.

Regarding the mutual translation of literary heritage and modern works of brotherly nationalities, in today's situation, it may be necessary to use Chinese as a medium—for example, Miao literature translated into Chinese, and then translated from Chinese into Mongolian by the Mongolian nationality, and so on. This increases the responsibility of using Chinese for translation: if the Chinese translation is not good, it will inevitably lead to repeated translations and the bad result of spreading false information.

(D) Creation Issues:

What is particularly exciting is that nationalities with writing systems, such as the Mongolian, Uyghur, Kazakh, and Korean ethnic groups, have already had realistic literature in the new era. Nationalities without writing systems have also produced writers who write in Chinese. Multi-ethnic literature and art is no longer empty talk! New life has produced new literature and art, and new literature and art inspire new life. However, the writers attending the symposium reflected that how to inherit national traditions and how to write local characteristics are still difficult problems to solve.

How to cultivate new forces is also an important issue. This is the most fundamental link in the development of literature and art of brotherly nationalities. Ethnic groups with writing systems and a foundation of new literature are relatively easy; encouraging amateur writers and holding competitions and awards are one of the methods. For nationalities without writing systems, on the one hand, attention should be paid to helping folk singers to create oral literature, and on the other hand, young people who can write in Chinese should be cultivated. Organizing Han Chinese writers to serve brotherly nationalities is also a good transitional approach.

Today, when the ranks of writers from brotherly nationalities have not yet grown, Han Chinese writers writing about the new life of brotherly nationalities can play a very important role. To write about the life of brotherly nationalities, we must first overcome the psychology of novelty seeking. Writers with this psychology want to find exotic ethnic flavors from the surface of things with the least amount of effort to satisfy the curiosity of readers. If the motive is to seek novelty, they will not enthusiastically go deep into life, but only rely on looking around and asking questions to "create." This will definitely fail to grasp the major changes and problems of today's national life. It will also cause the author to only look for special situations while ignoring the relationship between this special situation and the general cause of building the motherland. In this way, national life is isolated, and the whole is forgotten. If you don't look at the whole, you will definitely not be able to appreciate the brotherly friendship and love between nationalities, and you will not be able to write passionate works.

The psychology of novelty seeking is also inevitable in the hearts of writers from brotherly nationalities, if his purpose is to write for Han Chinese readers and satisfy their curiosity. We have already seen this trend.

At this symposium, writers from brotherly nationalities unanimously stated that the study of Marxist-Leninist theory by writers must be strengthened. This is the same need as Han Chinese writers. Only in this way can we improve the level of creation and write works that are full of Party spirit and serve workers, peasants, and soldiers.

(E) Overcome Great Han Chauvinism and Local Nationalism:

The Chinese Writers Association has failed to pay due attention to the literary work of brotherly nationalities: the central publishing agencies and the publishing agencies in the areas of brotherly nationalities do not have close contact, nor do they coordinate with each other to formulate translation and publication plans; the Han Chinese cadres working in the brotherly nationalities have not paid sufficient attention to the importance of translating the literature of various nationalities, because they either do not know what treasures there are in national literature at all. These many facts powerfully show that the ideology of Great Han Chauvinism does exist! On the literary and artistic front, the concept of multi-ethnic literature and art seems not yet formed.

In terms of translation work, the prejudice of Great Han Chauvinism should also be overcome in the work of translating the literature of various nationalities into Han Chinese. After the translated version of "Ashima" was published, it was praised by the majority of readers. However, in order to prevent Han Chinese readers from not understanding it, the translator made some changes in some places, such as the wonderful description of the girl's long hair—"the shadow of the setting sun" was changed to "rapeseed oil"! We should not replace the unique customs and clever imagination of the nation with a set of Han Chinese ones; the translator has a responsibility to be faithful to the original work.

In the ancient legends of the nation, there are inevitably some naturalistic and not-so-beautiful descriptions. Some works may contain backward and unhealthy things. For these, the translator should make appropriate revisions and cuts under the principle of being as faithful to the original work as possible. At the same time, the locality should not stubbornly refuse to allow the translator to change a single word of the original text. Narrowly cherishing things that should be abandoned is close to local nationalism. This is not conducive to promoting the national literary heritage.

In terms of creation: the publications of the Chinese Writers Association and its branches have the responsibility to translate and publish more works by brotherly nationalities. This can encourage creation in the languages of brotherly nationalities and is a good way to unite and compete.

How to improve is a common concern of writers from brotherly nationalities. They hope that Han Chinese writers will go to the areas of brotherly nationalities to help them. They also hope that the Beijing Literary Training Institute will give them opportunities to study. Here, we are willing to enthusiastically call on: Han Chinese writers to go to the areas of brotherly nationalities to experience life, to write, and to help the writers of brotherly nationalities. Due to differences in language, customs, etc., we may not be able to write good works as we wish when we go to experience life; helping the writers of brotherly nationalities will definitely be successful. We also request that the governments and literary and art organizations in various ethnic areas strengthen the leadership of literary and artistic work. According to the reflections of writers from brotherly nationalities: some leading cadres in some areas (many of whom are Han Chinese) do not care much about literary and artistic work, and some areas do not pay attention to literature and art, so that writers are assigned many administrative tasks, so that they have no time to write; or they repeatedly transfer writers to various places, so that they cannot reside in one place for a long time and go deep into life. The staffing of the local Federation of Literary and Art Circles in some areas is pitifully small, and everyone can only take care of organizational work and cannot write, or they delay organizational work if they take care of writing. Moreover, the contact between the local Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Writers Association is very insufficient, and it is not easy to directly obtain instructions and assistance from the Writers Association on creative issues.

In nationalities that do not yet have writing systems, our current focus should be on helping singers and artists. They have preserved the national literary heritage passed down from generation to generation, and are also creators. How to help them requires detailed planning.

What urgently needs to be solved and must be solved is the issue of how to train cadres. Without cadres, whether it is collection or collation, whether it is research or translation, there is nothing to talk about. By adjusting the existing cadres and existing amateur workers, we have a sizable team. Once this team is consolidated, it can exert greater and more power and become the backbone of developing business and cultivating new forces. This is not difficult to do, but it has not yet been done; to trace the source of the disease, I am afraid that the ideology of Great Han Chauvinism is playing tricks there: some leading cadres have never paid attention to this issue, and some are satisfied with the status quo, thinking that it is enough to have some embellishments. This idea comes from not paying attention to the literary and artistic undertakings of brotherly nationalities and should be corrected.

In ethnic areas, some people may also have this idea: everything must be local style, and there is no need to learn from the Han Chinese or other ethnic groups. This is undoubtedly the ideology of local nationalism. This will definitely hinder cultural exchange and be complacent.

In collation and research work, we must clearly understand: the collation and processing of the art of brotherly nationalities should be carried out on the original basis, maintaining its original traditions and characteristics, and should not violate the habits of brotherly nationalities.

(F) Specific Measures: In order to carry out the literary work of the brotherly nationalities, we intend to take the following measures: (1) Promote the leaders at all levels of various literary and art organizations to pay attention to the literary work of the brotherly nationalities, strengthen leadership, and encourage collection, collation, translation, and creation. Vigorously cultivate cadres for collecting and sorting out the literary heritage of brotherly nationalities, cultivate translation talents and writers. (2) The Chinese Writers Association and its branches should absorb writers from brotherly nationalities with achievements as members. With members as the center, writers from brotherly nationalities should have organizations for regular contact and regular study. (3) Consult with the People's Literature Publishing House and the National Publishing House to formulate a plan for publishing the classical literature and new creations of brotherly nationalities. Assist relevant publishing houses in doing a good job of translating Han Chinese literary works into the languages of brotherly nationalities and translating works between brotherly nationalities. Central and local literary publications should publish more works by writers from brotherly nationalities. (4) Select young writers from brotherly nationalities to study at the Literary Training Institute. (5) Establish branches of the Chinese Writers Association in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture. (6) The Chinese Writers Association establishes a National Literature Committee, responsible for organizing the development of the literary work of brotherly nationalities. (7) Establish literary and artistic creation publications in the languages of various brotherly nationalities in a planned way. (8) The Chinese Writers Association calls on Han Chinese writers to go to the areas of brotherly nationalities to experience life, create, and help the writers of brotherly nationalities to create.

The Chinese Writers Association has the responsibility to understand the literary work of all ethnic groups, so as to try to encourage and promote it, so that the literary work of all ethnic groups can be developed and prospered in collection and collation, translation, and creation.

    关于兄弟民族文学工作的报告
    ——在中国作家协会第二次理事会会议（扩大）上的报告（摘要）
    老舍
    1955年五一劳动节后，中国作家协会邀集了八个兄弟民族——彝、侗、僮、东乡、维吾尔、蒙古、苗、朝鲜（延边）的十一位同志，和两位熟悉兄弟民族文学的汉族同志，到北京来座谈兄弟民族的文学工作情况。
    现在让我们根据这次座谈会所提供的材料，把兄弟民族文学工作的情况与问题分项来说：
    （甲）民族文学遗产和新文学的兴起：
    在有文字的民族里，像蒙古族、维吾尔族与藏族，都有久远的文学传统。
    蒙古民族的长篇史诗“格斯尔的故事”的产生，要比成吉思汗出现于历史舞台还早两个世纪！这是优美的富有神奇性的人民文学著作，应当列入世界文化宝库。
    产生于十五世纪初期的史诗，由十二首长歌集成的“江格尔”，也是人民口传的巨著，至今还广泛地流传在蒙古人民中间。
    在这两大史诗之外，流传在民间的还有许多著作。
    今天，新的文学也生长起来。纳·赛音朝克图与巴·布仁贝赫的诗歌，朋斯克、敖德斯尔、玛拉沁夫、超克图纳仁等的小说与剧本都受到读者的欢迎与称许。
    新疆的维吾尔、哈萨克与乌兹别克等民族，在文学遗产上是可与蒙古民族媲美的。苏联刊印的第三、四世纪的“托瓦杜瓦”和第六、七世纪的“气斯塔尼伊利克别克”都是伊斯兰教传入以前就有了的宝贵遗产。十二世纪的“库他提·扣贝里克”是维吾尔族的重要史诗。此外，像代表维吾尔与乌兹别克文学伟大历史时期的那瓦伊的长诗，和哈萨克文学之父阿拜依的著作都是新疆的，同样也是构成祖国的文化历史的宝贵财产。
    十月革命与五四运动影响所及，使新疆各民族开始追求民主文学，涌现出不少的作家与诗人。解放以来，在文艺创作上，维吾尔与哈萨克等族都产生了不少比较优秀的作品。诗人铁依甫江和布哈拉等都孳孳不息地进行创作，祖农·哈迪尔等在短篇小说与剧本方面也有很好的成绩。
    藏族文学从第九世纪开始兴起，在十二世纪左右发展起来，十七世纪前后是昌盛时期。藏族的文学遗产，就重要的来说就有：“格萨王传”史诗。这部名著在元末明初写成，具有很高的文学价值，在民间流传很广，曾被改编为戏曲，还用为壁画题材。
    在抒情诗方面，有流传最广的第六世达赖喇嘛仓洋嘉错所作的抒情歌。藏民至今还传诵他的作品。在小说中，“米拉日巴的一生”传记小说具有世界文学的价值。这部著作已有英、法、日、蒙古、汉各种文字的译本。藏族的民间文学也是丰富多采的。
    现在，藏族涌现出来许多新知识分子，开始在优秀的文学传统的基础上创造出反映新生活的文学作品。
    延边朝鲜族的新兴文学，在这几年来，无论是诗歌还是散文，都有不少的成绩。剧本与小说之外，作家们也注意到编写民间故事和说唱文艺。
    甘肃、云南、贵州和广西都是多民族的省份。许多民族还没有文字，但是保留在口头上的文学是丰富多采的。每个民族都有许多优美的诗歌。
    （乙）开展搜集、整理、研究工作：
    从上述的各兄弟民族的文学遗产来看，无论是写下来的还是流传在口头上的，都是那么丰富！而且我们所根据的还只是参加座谈的几位同志所提供的一些材料，而不是兄弟民族文学的全部材料。我们有责任去收集、整理这些宝贵的材料，使它们成为全中国的文化财富！
    怎么去搜集呢？我们愿提出一些意见：（一）搜集工作必须遵从民族政策。（二）搜集工作是细致的、耐心持久的工作。民
  族的历史与社会背景都非一时半晌所能了解，而这些正是文学作品构成的重要因素。不细心，不深入了解，我们是会把精华漏掉或把糟粕看成精华，以讹传讹的。为深入了解口头的诗歌，我们也须注意到随伴着它的音乐与舞蹈。（三）搜集工作也是群众工作。搜集工作者应当深入生活，搞好群众关系，“也给也要”才能要到好东西。
    整理与研究，也有应该注意的几点：（一）整理工作最好是在当地进行，以便随时可以得到更多的帮助和更多的参考材料。整理了之后，和当地人民讨论也有很大的好处。（二）对古典的文学作品，必须运用马克思列宁主义的历史观点和阶级观点，去分析判断其思想内容，决定取舍。（三）在搜集整理工作中，我们也会遇到文字记载或口头传说的作品中有些残缺，对这个，不应随便添补！还有：兄弟民族的语言结构和语法有自己的特点，我们也不该轻易发挥整理者的想像力，随便增减。（四）口头上保留的长诗与传说，往往同一故事而有几种不同的说法，这需要极细致的研究与审慎的判断。首要的是就本民族的历史与社会背景去考虑问题，而不可主观地以搜集者所属的民族的心理去考虑。
    （丙）现在我们谈谈翻译问题：
    翻译是个关键问题，没有翻译，就没有各民族间的文学交流。
    翻译可分为三类：各民族翻译汉族文学，汉译各民族文学，和各民族互相翻译。
    参加座谈的各民族的同志们一致表示，迫切需要翻译汉族文学，以便吸取先进经验。蒙古族、维吾尔族与朝鲜族等已译了些汉族文学的作品，但还嫌不够。通过翻译汉族文学，各民族都有产生新的文学形式与体裁的可能。尤其迫不及待的是翻译文学理论——汉族写的和汉译的苏联的文学理论。没有理论的学习，创作即不易提高，这是个重要问题！这一方面须加意培养翻译工作者，一方面也需要与汉族作家合作。兄弟民族中翻译汉族文学作品的人应有机会与原著者会面，在一起推敲译稿。
    各民族文学的汉译工作，已经随着民族政策的实施而渐次活跃起来。像“阿诗玛”那样的优美的长诗的整理与翻译是值得表扬的。对于各民族的民歌的搜集也有了一定的成绩。
    关于兄弟民族互译文学遗产和现代作品，在今天的情况下，大概须以汉文为媒介——譬如汉译的苗族文学，又被蒙古族由汉文译为蒙古文等等。这就加重了用汉文作翻译的责任：汉文译得不好，就必定造成辗转翻译，以讹传讹的恶果。
    （丁）创作问题：
    特别值得我们兴奋的是：有文字的民族，像蒙古、维吾尔、哈萨克，与朝鲜等族，已经有了新时代的现实主义文学。没有文字的民族也产生了用汉文写作的作家。多民族的文艺已不是一句空话了！新的生活产生了新的文艺，新的文艺鼓舞着新的生活。可是，出席座谈的作家们反映，如何继承民族传统，如何写出地方特色，还是很不易解决的问题。
    如何培养新生力量也是重要的问题。这是发展兄弟民族文学最根本的一环。有文字而且有了新文学基础的民族比较容易；鼓励业余作家，举行竞赛与评奖就是办法之一。对没有文字的民族，一方面应注意帮助民间的歌手，创作口头文学，一方面应培养能以汉文写作的青年。组织汉族作家去为兄弟民族服务，也不失为过渡的好办法。
    在兄弟民族作家队伍还未壮大的今天，汉族作家去描写兄弟民族的新生活是
  有很大作用的。写兄弟民族的生活，首先应当克服猎奇心理。有这样心理的作家是要以最少的劳力，从事物表面上找到异族情调，去满足读者的好奇心。动机在猎奇，就不会热诚地去深入生活，而只凭东看一眼，西问一声，便要进行“创作”了。这一定抓不住今天民族生活的重大变化和问题。也会使作者只找特殊的情况，而忽视了这特殊情况与一般的建设祖国的大业有什么关系。这样，就把民族生活孤立起来，而忘记了整体。不看整体，一定体会不到民族间兄弟般的友谊与热爱，也就不会写出有热情的作品来。
    在兄弟民族作家心中也难免猎奇心理的作祟，假若他的目的是在写给汉族的读者，满足汉族读者的好奇心。这个苗头已被我们看见了。
    在这次座谈会上，兄弟民族作家都一致地表示：须加强作家们的马克思列宁主义理论的学习。这也和汉族作家的需要一样。也只有这样，我们才能提高创作水平，写出富有党性，为工农兵服务的作品。
    （戊）克服大汉族主义思想和地方民族主义思想：
    中国作家协会对兄弟民族文学工作未能给予应有的注意：中央的出版机关与兄弟民族地区的出版机关没有密切的联系，也没有互相配合着拟订翻译与出版计划；在兄弟民族中工作的汉族干部没有充分注意翻译各民族文学的重要，因为他们或者根本不晓得民族文学有什么宝藏。这许多事实有力地说明大汉族主义思想是的确存在着的！在文艺战线上，多民族的文艺这一概念似乎还未形成。
    就翻译工作来说，在汉译各民族文学的工作中也应当克服大汉族主义的偏见。“阿诗玛”的译文发表了以后，得到广大读者的称许。可是，译者为了怕汉族读者不能了解，有些地方就加以改动，像女郎的长发的美妙形容——“落日的影子”便被改为“菜油”！我们不应该把民族特有的风俗习惯与巧妙的想像换上一套汉族的；翻译者有责任忠实于原著。
    在民族的古远的传说中难免有些自然主义的、不大美好的描写。有的作品中也许带着落后的不健康的东西。对这些，译者是应在尽量忠实于原著的原则下加以适当的修正与剪裁的。同时，地方上也不宜固执地不许译者更改原文一字。褊狭地珍视本当遗弃的东西，便近于地方民族主义了。这并不利于发扬民族文学遗产。
    就创作来说：中国作家协会和各分会的刊物有责任多翻译刊载一些兄弟民族的作品。这便能鼓励用兄弟民族语言创作，也是团结与竞赛的好办法。
    怎样提高，是兄弟民族作家们一致关切着的问题。他们希望汉族作家到兄弟民族地区去，帮助他们。他们也希望北京的文学讲习所给他们以学习的机会。在这里，我们愿意热情地号召：汉族作家到兄弟民族地区去，去体验生活，去写作，去帮助兄弟民族的作家。因语言、风俗等等的不同，我们去体验生活，未必如愿以偿地写出好的作品；帮助兄弟民族作家，一定会有成绩。我们也要求：各民族地区的政府与文艺团体加强文艺工作的领导。据兄弟民族作家们的反映：有的地区领导干部（有许多是汉族的）对文艺工作不大关心，有的地区因不重视文艺而使作家担任许多行政工作，以致无暇写作；或屡屡调遣作家到各地方去，以致不能长期居留一地，深入生活。有的地区文联编制小得可怜，大家顾了组织工作便不能写作，顾了写作就耽误了组织工作。而且，地区的文联和作家协会的联系十分不够，对创作问题不易直接得到作家协会的指示与帮助。
    在还没有文字的民族里，目前我们应着重帮助的对象是歌手与艺人。他们保存了世代相传的民族文学遗产，同时也是创作者。如何帮助他们，还须详为计划。
    急待解决、必须解决的是怎样培养干部的问题。没有干部，无论是搜集还是整理，无论是研究还是翻译，都无从说起。就现有的干部和现有的业余工作者加以调整，我们就有一个不小的队伍。这个队伍一经巩固起来，就能发挥更大更多的力量，成为发展业务和培养新生力量的主干。这个不难作到，可是现在还没有作；追查病源，恐怕也是大汉族主义思想在那儿作怪：有的领导干部从来没有注意过这个问题，有的或者满足于现况，认为有那么一些点缀也就够了。这种想法来自不重视兄弟民族的文学事业，理应加以矫正。
    在民族地区也可能有人有这样的想法：一切都要本地风光，无须向汉族或其他民族学习。这无疑的是地方民族主义思想。这一定会阻碍文化交流，故步自封。
    在整理研究工作上，我们必须认识清楚：对兄弟民族艺术的整理加工，应在原有的基础上进行，保持它原来的传统与特点，不能违反兄弟民族的习惯。
      （己）具体措施：为开展各兄弟民族文学工作，我们打算采取如下的一些措施：（一）推动各文艺团体的各级领导重视兄弟民族文学工作，加强领导，鼓励搜集、整理、翻译与创作。大力地培养搜集整理兄弟民族文学遗产的干部，培养翻译人才与作家。（二）中国作家协会和各分会应吸收兄弟民族有成绩的作家作为会员。以会员为中心，兄弟民族的作家们应有经常联系、定期学习的组织。（三）商请人民文学出版社与民族出版社拟定出版兄弟民族的古典文学和新的创作的计划。协助有关出版社做好汉文文学作品译成各兄弟民族文字和各兄弟民族互相翻译作品的工作。中央的与各地方的文学刊物应多发表兄弟民族作家的作品。（四）选取兄弟民族青年作家到文学讲习所学习。（五）成立中国作家协会新疆维吾尔自治区、内蒙古自治区及延边朝鲜族自治州等分会。（六）中国作家协会成立民族文学委员会，负责组织发展兄弟民族文学的工作。（七）有步骤地创办各兄弟民族文字的文学创作刊物。（八）中国作家协会号召汉族作家到兄弟民族地区去体验生活，进行创作和帮助兄弟民族作家进行创作。
    中国作家协会有责任了解所有各民族的文学工作情况，从而设法鼓舞推动，使各民族的文学工作在搜集和整理、翻译与创作上，都得到发展与繁荣。
