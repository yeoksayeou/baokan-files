    A Young Forestry Activist
    By our reporter Zhu Bo
    Gou Jing, who attended the 5-province (region) afforestation conference, is a young forestry team leader from Goujiazhuang Village, Huichuan County, Gansu Province, and a model Communist Youth League member recognized by the villagers. In the past few years, he led the forestry team, extinguished forest fires several times, fought against those who illegally cut down trees several times, and protected the important wealth of the motherland's construction—the forest—from being destroyed.
    Gou Jing is only 21 years old this year. Like many people in his childhood, he had many questions about the changes in nature since he was a shepherd boy. "Why does it rain?", "Where do the clouds come from?" and so on. Some children repeated the stories they had heard from adults, saying that it rained because of the "God of Rain," and others said that it rained because this area had good "feng shui"... However, he put forward a different view. He believed that rain was related to forests. Because, once he was herding sheep on the mountain. He saw a layer of white gas rising from the forest near the valley. At first, he could vaguely see the forest and the village, but later, the white gas became more and more dense. It was like a white wave, submerging the valley, the forest on the hillside, and the village. The remaining mountains looked like green islands. He was attracted by this strange sight. He was curious and wanted to go inside and see what this white gas was. He ran down from the mountain and plunged into the white gas, but he could not see anything in the thick fog. He walked further down, and it was raining at the foot of the mountain. He climbed back to the top of the mountain, where the sky was still blue.
    Gou Jing thought about this natural phenomenon for a long time. He thought that rain must be related to forests, but of course, he had no way to explain the reason. From that time on, in his young mind, he developed a love for forests.
    After liberation, he learned the reason from forestry workers, that forests can conserve a large amount of water, which is then evaporated by the sun and turned into humid air. When humid air accumulates, it easily rains. Moreover, he also knew the role of forests in national construction. In this way, forests became even more lovable in Gou Jing's mind.
    Every time he went out, he habitually looked up to see the lush forests. Every time he went up the mountain, he always went into the forest to see. He stroked the thick tree trunks, looked from the roots to the tops of the trees, and said to himself, "What a good pine tree, one tree can pull out at least five or six railway sleepers."
    Last February, he was driving an ox cart to deliver manure to the fields when he suddenly saw a fire on Huangxianggou Mountain in the south of the village. He thought, if there was a fire in the spring, it would burn all the forests. He left the ox cart and shouted for people to put out the fire.
    He and four other people ran to the place where the fire started and saw that it was burning dry weeds. The flames were four or five feet high and were being blown around by the wind. In a short time, three or four acres of weeds were burned. They saw that the fire was fierce, and if they didn't put it out quickly, it would burn all the surrounding weeds and forests. So, the five of them rushed towards the fire, but they were forced back by the flames and thick smoke as soon as they approached. Gou Jing saw that everyone was hesitating, so he firmly said to everyone, "We must put out the fire, otherwise, the country's property will suffer great losses!" As he spoke, he ran a few steps and jumped over the flames. The others followed him under his leadership. Although their clothes were scorched by the fire, and their faces and hands were burned, they gritted their teeth and persisted in fighting the fire. They used brooms to beat the fire and their feet to stomp it out, and finally put out the fire. In this way, they rescued more than 3,000 acres of weeds and more than 800 acres of forests.
    Their brave actions were praised by the village cadres and the masses. Afterwards, he thought that if there had been more people and organization this time, the fire would have been put out more quickly, but now, because there were few people, they suffered a loss. He thought that if there was no forestry organization in the long run, they would suffer even greater losses. He told his opinion to the Youth League organization and the forestry committee, and they all agreed with this opinion. A forestry team with Youth League members as the core was organized, and Gou Jing was elected as the forestry team leader.
    After the establishment of the forestry team, Gou Jing became even more active. Although the forestry team was assigned to be responsible for protecting the forests, he still often went deep into the forests for inspection. Because he thought that during the busy farming season, the team members would inevitably be negligent. Every time he went to work in the fields, he would take a detour to check the forests.
    One day in June last year, he was walking by the forest when he saw a dozen people in the south, leading eight or nine animals, walking along the valley. He was very surprised. These people didn't look like they were going to work in the fields, nor were they going to the market, because there was no market town here. What were they doing? Later, as he got closer, he saw that those people were carrying axes, and the animals had loads on their backs. He knew that they were here to cut down trees.
    Dealing with tree cutters is very difficult. Since they have come, they will not easily go back. In the past, forestry workers had fought with tree cutters. What should he do? Gou Jing looked around and saw no one, so he had to reason with them himself.
    Just as he thought, those people saw him walking over and stared at him.
    He smiled calmly and said, "Where are you folks from? Are you planning to cut down trees?"
    "Yes, planning to cut some firewood." One person saw that Gou Jing's attitude was very kind, so he honestly explained his intention. Gou Jing continued to smile and said, "This place is closed to the mountains, you can't cut down trees casually." He also explained the government's policy on protecting forests to them.
    Several of them didn't wait for him to finish, and scolded him for being nosy, and were about to start cutting down trees.
    Gou Jing saw that these guys were really unreasonable, and he couldn't stop them by himself. He quickly returned to the village, found a dozen forestry team members, and ran back to the forest.
    Gou Jing was also afraid that those people would misunderstand, so he ran ahead and said, "We are not here to fight. No matter how you scold me, I don't care. We are here to persuade you not to cut down public trees, lest we report to the government and be criticized and punished."
    Most of the people began to waver after hearing this. They said, "I said we should go back early, don't make trouble, but you didn't listen. We are going back." Gou Jing followed up and said, "These folks understand the truth. Everyone should go back. Now is the time to use people in the fields. Don't delay the work in the fields."
    After persuasion, most of them led their animals back, but there was still one person who insisted on cutting down trees. After discussion, everyone decided to send this person to the district to let the district staff educate him.
    After many struggles with mountain fires and people who violate the forest protection policy, Gou Jing and his forestry team have become more active and experienced in forestry work. He and the members of the forestry team all expressed their determination to protect the forests of the motherland.

    一个护林的青年积极分子
    本报记者　朱波
    出席这次5省（区）造林大会的苟敬，是甘肃省会川县苟家庄村的一个青年护林组长、是全村群众公认的优秀青年团员。在过去的几年，他领导着护林小组，曾数次扑灭山火，数次同滥伐林木的人进行斗争，保护祖国建设的重要财富森林——没有受到破坏。
    苟敬今年只有21岁，他和很多人在童年时代一样，从很小放羊的时候起就对大自然的变化有很多疑问。“天为什么会下雨呢？”，“云彩是那里来的呢？”等等。有些孩子就把从大人那里听来的一套搬出来了，说下雨是因为有“雨神”，也有的说下雨是因为这一带“风水好”……但是，他提出了一个不同的看法，他认为下雨和森林有关系。因为，有一次他在山头上放羊。看见靠近山谷的森林里，升起一层白色的气体。开始，还可以模糊地看见森林和村庄，后来，这白色的气体愈来愈多，愈来愈厚，它像白色的海浪一样，把山谷、山半腰的森林和村庄都淹没了，剩下的山头像是一个一个的绿色的小岛。他被这奇怪的景象吸引住了，他好奇地想钻到里面去看一看，看看这白色的气体究竟是什么东西。他从山头上跑下来，钻进白色的气体里，只见雾气腾腾的什么也看不见。再朝下走，山下边正在下雨。他又爬上山头，上面仍然是蓝蓝的晴天。
    苟敬对这种大自然的现象想了很久，他想下雨和森林一定有关系，当然，他没有办法解释其中的道理。从那时起，在他那幼小的心灵里，就产生了热爱森林的情感。
    解放以后，他从林业工作人员那里，才懂得其中的道理，原来是森林可以涵养大量的水源，然后又被太阳蒸发出去，变成潮湿的空气，潮湿的空气堆积的多了，就容易下雨。并且，他还知道森林对国家建设的作用。这样一来，森林在苟敬的心目中，显得更加可爱了。
    他每次走出家门，总是很习惯地抬起头来，看看这茂盛的森林。他每次上山，总要钻到森林里去看，他抚摸着粗大的树干，两眼从树根一直望到树梢，自言自语地说：“多好的松树呀，一棵树少说也能拉出五、六根枕木来。”
    去年二月，他赶着牛车向地里送粪，忽然看到村南黄香沟山上起了火。他想，在春天里起火还得了，这会把森林全部烧光。他丢下牛车，就喊叫着人们去救火。
    他和另外4个人跑到起火的地方一看，烧的是干枯了的野草，火焰有四、五尺高，被风吹着一直向四周烧去。不一会的工夫，就有三、四亩野草被烧掉了。他们看到火势很凶，如果不赶快把火扑灭，会把周围的野草和森林全部烧光。于是，5个人就一齐向火堆扑过去了，但是，他们刚一接近火堆，就被火焰和浓烟逼了回来。苟敬看见大家都在犹疑，他就坚决地对大家说：“我们一定要把火扑灭，要不，国家财产要受多大的损失呀！”他说着就紧跑了几步，跳过了火焰。其他几个人在他的带动下也都随着跳过去了。尽管他们的衣服被火烤焦了，脸和手被火烤疼了，他们还是咬着牙坚持救火。用扫帚打，用脚踏，终于把火扑灭了。这样，他们几个人就抢救了3，000多亩野草和800多亩森林。
    他们这种勇敢的行动，受到了村干部的表扬和群众的称赞。事后他想，这次如果人多，有组织，火会被扑灭的更快，现在，却因为人少吃了亏，以后日子长着哩，如果没有护林的组织，一定会吃更大的亏。他把这个意见告诉了团组织和护林委员，他们都同意这个意见。组织了以团员为核心的护林小组，并且推选苟敬为护林组长。
    护林小组成立之后，苟敬表现更积极了。虽然护林组分工负责保护森林，但是，他还是经常深入森林进行检查。因为他想到在农忙的时候，难免组员有疏忽的地方。他每次上地做活时，总要绕一个弯，沿着森林检查一下。
    去年6月，有一天他正在森林边上走着，看见南边有十几个人，牵着八、九头牲口，正顺着山谷走过来。他很奇怪，这些人不像是下地的，也不是赶集的，因为这里没有集镇，他们是干什么的呢？后来，离的近了，他看到那些人都带着斧头，牲口上还有驮子，才知道他们是来砍树的。
    对付砍树的人是非常困难的，他们既然来了就不会轻易回去，过去护林人员曾同砍树的人打过架。怎么办呢？苟敬向四周看了看一个人也没有，只好自己去同他们讲道理了。
    正像他想的那样，那些人看见他走过来，都瞪着眼睛看他。
    他不慌不忙地微笑着说：“乡亲们从那里来，你们是不是想砍树？”
    “是啊，打算砍点烧柴。”一个人看到苟敬态度很和气，就老老实实地把来意说了出来。苟敬继续笑迷迷地说：“这里封山啦，不能随便砍树啦。”他还把人民政府保护森林的政策向他们解释了一遍。
    其中有几个人没有等他说完，就骂他是狗吃老鼠多管闲事，并且就要动手砍树了。
    苟敬看见这些家伙实在不讲道理，自己也拦他们不住。他就赶快回到村里，找了十几个护林组员，又跑回森林里来。
    苟敬还怕那些人发生误会，就跑在前头，说：“我们不是来打架的，不管你们怎么骂我，我也不在意，我们是来劝说你们还是不要砍公家的树木，免得我们报告给政府，挨批评，受处分。”
    多数人听了开始动摇了。他们说：“我说趁早回去吧，不要惹事了，你们不听。我们可要回去啦。”苟敬紧接着说：“还是这几位乡亲明白道理，大家都回去吧，现在地里正用人的时候，不要把地里活耽误了。”
    经过劝说大部分人都拉着牲口回去了，但是，还有一个人，坚持要砍树。大家商量了一下，就决定把这个人送到区上去，让区里的工作人员对他进行教育。
    苟敬和他的护林小组，经过多次的和山火、和破坏护林政策的人进行斗争之后，他们对护林工作更加积极了，也更加有经验了。他和护林小组的组员都一致表示，决心把祖国的森林保护好。
