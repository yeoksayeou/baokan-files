    Mobile Houses on Construction Sites

    Wang Yufu, a foreman at the First Engineering Company of the Heilongjiang Provincial Urban Construction Bureau, has created a prefabricated temporary structure based on the cold climate and abundant timber resources of Heilongjiang. The workers call it the "mobile house."

    At the end of a previous project, Wang Yufu used over 500 cubic meters of leftover wood and short pieces to build several of these wooden houses. He first designed the blueprints, dividing the walls and roofs of the houses into many small components, using scrap wood to make them. When needed, the components are installed. Each component of the roof is nailed with iron rings, and nails are also hammered into the walls. After installation, the iron rings and nails are connected with iron wire to maintain the house's sturdiness. To maintain the indoor temperature, generally, there are two layers of wooden walls, with a 20-centimeter gap filled with sawdust, so the wind can't blow into the house. When the outdoor temperature is 15 degrees below zero, the inside doesn't freeze. Heating equipment can also be installed inside. The wooden boards on the roof are covered with sheet iron to prevent rain. The house has doors and windows, and there is plenty of light. The workers are very happy with these houses. Now, each work area of the company uses them as dormitories, offices, canteens, and warehouses.

    The cost of such a prefabricated house is 27 yuan per square meter, which is more than twice the cost of an earthen house, but it can be used for seven or eight years and moved 15-20 times.

    These houses are quick to install. Last September, the company accepted the task of building workers' dormitories for the Harbin Vehicle Factory. When the contract was signed, there was very little time left before the start of construction, and there was not enough time to build temporary earthen houses. However, they transported the prefabricated wooden house components the day before construction began, and sent a dozen people who erected a dormitory that could accommodate dozens of people within 7 hours, ensuring a quick start to construction.

    To further improve these houses, they have standardized the specifications of similar components to facilitate repeated and uniform use. They are also studying the use of tar paper instead of sheet iron to reduce costs.

    工地上的移动房子
    黑龙江省城市建设局第一工程公司工长王玉福，根据黑龙江地区气候寒冷又盛产木材的特点，创造了一种预制式的暂设工程。工人们都管它叫作“移动房子”。
    在前项工程结束的时候，王玉福利用剩下的500多立方公尺木材和短料制造了几座这种木房。他先设计好图样，把房子的墙壁和房盖划分成许多小块的构件，用废木料作好。用的时候，就把构件安装起来。在房盖的每个构件上都钉着铁环，墙上又钉着钉子，安装好以后，用铁丝把铁环和钉子连结在一起，就保持了房子的坚固。为了保持房内温度，一般都是两层木板墙，中间空20公分装满锯末，风吹不到房子里来。室外气温在零下15度的时候，屋里不结冰。屋里也可以安装取暖设备。房盖上的木板包上铁皮，可以防雨。房子有门窗，光线充足。工人都很欢迎这样的房子。现在这个公司各工区都用来做宿舍、办公室、食堂、仓库。
    这样的预制式房子，每平方公尺造价27元，比土房的造价高一倍多，但它可以使用七、八年，移动15—20次。
    使用这种房子安装起来很快。去年9月，这个公司接受承建哈尔滨车辆厂工人宿舍的任务。签订合同的时候，已经离开工时间很短，要是用草泥盖临时工房，时间来不及。但是，他们在开工前一天把预制木房构件运来，派了十来个人，在7小时内就架起一栋能容纳好几十人的宿舍，保证了迅速开工。
    为了进一步改善这种房屋，他们统一了同类构件的规格，以便重复和统一使用构件。他们还研究了用油毡纸代替铁皮，以降低成本。
