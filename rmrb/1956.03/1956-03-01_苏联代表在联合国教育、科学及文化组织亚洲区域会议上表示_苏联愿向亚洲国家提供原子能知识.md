    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 29th - The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Asian Regional Conference opened in Tokyo on February 28th. Representatives and observers from 22 countries, including the Soviet Union, India, Burma, the United States, and France, are participating in the conference.

    The conference will last for 5 days. It will discuss issues related to promoting cultural and scientific exchange and cooperation between countries, such as the establishment of an international fund for education, science, and culture.

    At the opening session, the head of the Soviet delegation, Soviet Deputy Minister of Culture Kemenov, suggested that the People's Republic of China be admitted to UNESCO and demanded the expulsion of the Chiang Kai-shek clique's representatives. He pointed out that "the Kuomintang representatives have no right to speak for the Chinese people," and that "only the 600 million people on the Chinese mainland can represent China. The People's Republic of China is the only legitimate Chinese government."

    This proposal by the Soviet representative was supported by representatives from India, Burma, and Afghanistan. Kabir, the chief representative of India, said that the recognition of the People's Republic of China as a member state should be considered based on the fact that it already exists, and it should not be excluded from the organization based solely on opposition. However, the Soviet representative's legitimate suggestion was rejected at the meeting.

    The head of the Soviet delegation, Kemenov, expressed regret that the conference rejected the suggestion for China to join the organization. He said that China has great experience in education and science. UNESCO cannot develop normally or produce proper results without China's participation.

    When talking about the Soviet Union's attitude towards developing international cultural and scientific exchange and cooperation, Kemenov said that the Soviet people sympathize with the Asian people's desire for independence and hope to see their efforts in training scientific personnel, improving living standards, and developing national cultures. He said that the Soviet Union is prepared to assist Asian countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, without any military or political conditions attached. He suggested that the conference pass a resolution calling for a ban on the use of atomic energy for military purposes, and stated that the Soviet Union is willing to provide Asian countries with knowledge about atomic energy.

    Kemenov also expressed his hope that Japan could send delegations of scientists, artists, and cultural workers to visit the Soviet Union.

    苏联代表在联合国教育、科学及文化组织亚洲区域会议上表示
    苏联愿向亚洲国家提供原子能知识
    新华社29日讯　东京消息：联合国教育、科学及文化组织亚洲区域会议，2月28日在东京开幕。参加会议的有苏联、印度、缅甸、美国、法国等22个国家的代表和观察员。
    这次会议将举行5天。它将讨论建立教育、科学及文化国际基金等有关促进各国间文化、科学交流与合作的问题。
    在开幕会上，苏联代表团团长、苏联文化部副部长凯曼诺夫建议接纳中华人民共和国参加联合国教育、科学及文化组织，要求驱逐蒋介石集团的代表。他指出：“国民党的代表没有权利替中国人民说话”，“只有中国大陆上的6亿人民才能代表中国，中华人民共和国是唯一合法的中国政府”。
    苏联代表的这个提议受到印度、缅甸和阿富汗的代表的支持。印度首席代表卡比尔说，应该根据中华人民共和国已经存在的事实来考虑承认它为成员国，而不应该只凭反对情绪就把它排斥在组织以外。但是，苏联代表的这个正当的建议在会上遭到了否决。
    苏联代表团团长凯曼诺夫对于会议否决中国参加这个组织的建议表示遗憾。他说，中国在教育、科学等方面有着伟大的经验。联合国教育、科学及文化组织没有中国参加就不可能正常地发展，也不可能产生正当的成果。
    凯曼诺夫谈到苏联对发展国际文化、科学交流与合作的态度的时候说，苏联人民同情亚洲人民争取独立的愿望，并且希望看到他们在训练科学人员、提高生活水平和发展民族文化方面的努力。他说，苏联准备在不附有任何军事和政治条件的平等互利基础上，援助亚洲国家。他建议会议通过决议，要求禁止把原子能用于军事目的，并且表示苏联愿意向亚洲国家提供关于原子能的知识。
    凯曼诺夫还表示希望日本能派科学、艺术和文化工作者的代表团到苏联访问。
