Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 1st – According to Vietnam News Agency on the 1st, Phạm Văn Đồng, Premier of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, answered questions posed to him on February 23rd by Jerome Caminada, a reporter from the London "Times". When asked about his opinion on the upcoming elections in South Vietnam, Phạm Văn Đồng said that the Vietnamese people have repeatedly and clearly expressed their opinion on this election farce: First, it violates the Geneva Accords. Second, it is completely undemocratic and unfree. Third, all strata of Vietnamese society oppose it.

Phạm Văn Đồng reiterated that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam requests a reconvening of the Geneva Conference on Indochina to study and jointly reach agreements to decide on measures to ensure the implementation of the Geneva Accords, especially the resolution of political issues, namely the realization of Vietnam's unification through free nationwide general elections.

The "Times" reporter then asked: Are there any plans to hold separate elections in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam? Phạm Văn Đồng replied: Our policy is to strictly abide by the Geneva Accords.

The "Times" reporter asked Phạm Văn Đồng what his view was on South Vietnam's argument that South Vietnam did not sign the agreements signed in Geneva in July 1954 and is therefore not bound by them. Phạm Văn Đồng refuted the absurdity of this argument by citing his letters to the chairmen of the Geneva Conference.

Phạm Văn Đồng also spoke to Jerome Caminada about the progress of reconstruction work in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Phạm Văn Đồng said that we have made significant progress in economic recovery and improving the people's living standards. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is very concerned about agricultural production, and also extremely concerned about small-scale industry, handicrafts, and industry. The initial achievements are: the supply of rice and consumer goods is sufficient to meet the needs of the people; prices are stable; there is no unemployment; and economic, industrial, and commercial activities are developing day by day. Now, the people of the North are enthusiastically working hard to complete the 1956 national plan of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

Phạm Văn Đồng concluded by saying: "Britain is a member of the Geneva Conference discussing the Indochina issue and is one of the two countries jointly chairing the conference. Britain has made a significant contribution to peace in Vietnam on the basis of recognizing the national rights of the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Today, the British government has continued to clearly state that it still adheres to the Geneva Accords. The Vietnamese people hope that its actions will not be inconsistent with its words."

    范文同答伦敦“泰晤士报”记者问
    新华社河内1日电　据越南通讯社1日讯：越南民主共和国总理范文同2月23日答复了伦敦“泰晤士报”记者杰罗姆·卡密那塔向他提出的问题。范文同在回答关于对南越就要举行选举的看法时说，越南人民已经多次清楚地表明了他们对这个选举丑剧的意见：一、它是违反日内瓦协定的。二、它是完全不民主和不自由的。三、越南社会一切阶层都反对它。
    范文同再一次提到，越南民主共和国政府要求重新召开关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议，以便研究和共同达成协议，以决定保证日内瓦协定的履行的措施，尤其是政治问题的解决，即通过全国自由普选来实现越南的统一。
    “泰晤士报”记者又问道：是否有在越南民主共和国分别举行选举的任何打算？范文同回答说：我们的政策是严格遵守日内瓦协定。
    “泰晤士报”记者问范文同对南越的这一论点采取何种看法：即南越没有签订1954年7月在日内瓦签订的协定，因此不受协定的约束，范文同引述他给日内瓦会议主席的信件驳斥了这种论点的荒谬。
    范文同还对杰罗姆·卡密那塔谈到越南民主共和国国内的恢复工作进行的情况。范文同说，我们在经济恢复和改善人民的生活水平方面有显著的进展，越南民主共和国政府非常关心农业生产，同时也极关心小型工业、手工业和工业。初步的成就是：大米和消费品的供应足够满足人民的需要；物价稳定；没有失业；经济、工业和商业活动正在日益发展。现在，北方的人民正在热情地忙着为完成越南民主共和国的1956年国家计划而努力。
    范文同最后说：“英国是讨论印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的成员国，并且是这个会议的两个共同担任主席的国家之一。英国在承认越南、柬埔寨和老挝三国人民的民族权利的基础上已经对越南的和平作了显著的贡献。今天，英国政府已经继续明白表示，它仍然信守日内瓦协定。越南人民希望，它的行动不会和它的言论不一致。”
