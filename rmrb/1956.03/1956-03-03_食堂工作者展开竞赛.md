Canteen workers at the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory have achieved great results in their competition. In the past, the staple foods were always rice and steamed buns, and the dishes were a single pot of "cabbage, tofu, and potatoes, seasoned with oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and scallions," sometimes the same for morning and evening meals. The masses complained that it was "the same old thing" and "cookie-cutter meals." Now, there are three or four dishes for each meal, with prices set at five cents, ten cents, twenty cents, and thirty cents, etc. For staple foods, they have come up with several varieties such as yam steamed buns, sweet potato pancakes, shredded radish flower rolls, and vegetable noodle soup. Breakfast also includes sweet potatoes, steamed buns, and mutton soup. The masses have praised it repeatedly.

Currently, the workers directly engaged in production are working hard to complete the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The comrades in the service departments should arrange their lives well to ensure they work healthily and happily. This is also indispensable for completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The comrades at the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory canteen have taken the lead in setting a good example, and canteen workers in other enterprises should quickly catch up.

    食堂工作者展开竞赛
    太原矿山机器厂食堂的工作人员在竞赛当中取得了很大的成绩。过去主食总是米饭、蒸馍，菜是“白菜豆腐山药蛋，油盐酱醋葱和蒜”一锅煮，有时早晚不变样。群众反映是：“老一套”，“印板饭”。现在每餐菜有三、四样，菜价规定五分、一角、二角、三角等几种。主食方面想出了山药蒸馍、甘薯烙饼、黄萝卜花卷、面条菜汤等好几种。早点还有甘薯、蒸馍、羊杂割等。群众纷纷赞好。
    现在直接从事生产的职工们正在为提前完成第一个五年计划紧张地劳动，服务部门的同志应当把他们的生活安排得很好，保证他们健康地愉快地工作，这也是为了提前完成五年计划所不可缺少的。太原矿山机器厂食堂的同志们带头做出了好榜样，其它企业的食堂工作同志也应当赶快赶上去。
