To the Editors:

    On November 23, 1955, the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee Materials Supply Office and the Xiangfang Lumber Processing Plant of the Northeast Lumber Industry Bureau signed a contract to transfer 900 cubic meters of first, second, and third grade basswood. However, many of the delivered logs looked good on the outside, but when the bark was peeled back, the inside was like bread, crumbling to the touch.

    Later, the Xiangfang Lumber Processing Plant sent people to inspect all the delivered lumber and found that among the 700 cubic meters of lumber delivered, out-of-grade materials accounted for 24.28%, and fourth-grade materials accounted for 2.67%. They agreed to dispose of these substandard materials separately and re-allocate new materials that met the specifications. However, the quality of the "new materials" that were replenished was even worse. For example, in a batch of about 188 cubic meters of lumber, out-of-grade materials accounted for 33.32%, and fourth-grade materials accounted for 4.86%.

    Why did the Xiangfang Lumber Processing Plant store perfectly good lumber until it became like "bread"? Could it be that the factory was unaware of the severe deterioration of the wood? Their irresponsible work style not only wasted national resources, but also wasted a large amount of transportation capacity by transporting rotten wood over long distances. The extra transportation costs in this case amounted to about 3,550 yuan. The Northeast Lumber Industry Bureau should seriously examine their work.

### 大批木材都变质了

    大批木材都变质了编辑同志：
    1955年11月23日，天津市人民委员会物资供应处和东北制材工业管理局香坊木材加工厂签订了一项调拨一、二、三等椴木900立方公尺的合同。但是运来的木材中，有很多是外皮很好看，等到剥开皮一看，里面却和面包一样，一抓一把。
    后来，香坊木材加工厂派人对运来的全部木材进行了检查，发现运来的700立方公尺的木材中，等外材占24.28％，四等材占2.67％。他们同意对这些不合规格的木材另行处理，再重新调拨合乎规格的新料。但是，补发来的“新料”质量却更坏。例如，在一批188立方公尺左右的木材中，等外材就占33.32％，四等材占4.86％。
    香坊木材加工厂为什么把好好的木材都保管成了“面包”呢？木材变质得这样严重，难道工厂还不知道吗？他们这种不负责任的工作作风，不但糟塌了国家的物资，而且还把腐朽木材长途运输而浪费了大量运输力，像这次多花的运输费就有3，550元左右。东北制材工业管理局应该认真检查他们的工作。　王振沧
