Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 2nd. The "Times of India" reported on March 2nd that the production capacity of the Bhilai steel plant, being built with Soviet assistance in India, is expected to increase from the originally planned 1 million tons of steel ingots per year to approximately 1.3 million tons. In addition, it will be able to produce 100,000 to 300,000 tons of cast iron. The Indian government is considering this issue based on the engineering report submitted by Soviet experts.

The main method for increasing the production capacity of the Bhilai steel plant will be to build three blast furnaces instead of two. According to the report, Soviet experts say that the Bhilai steel plant will apply the most modern production technology. Modern instruments will automatically manage these blast furnaces.

The news said that it is possible to directly employ 7,300 people to complete the Bhilai steel plant project. It is estimated that the total value of this project is 1.1 billion rupees, of which the value of Soviet equipment, materials, and technical guidance is approximately 540 million rupees.

The news said that the factory will begin production in 1958. The design of this factory stipulates that its steel output will eventually be increased to 2.5 million tons.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 2nd. When answering questions in the People's Chamber on March 1st, the Indian Minister of Food and Agriculture, A. P. Jain, stated that the Indian government intends to establish a large-scale mechanized farm using machinery and equipment supplied by the Soviet Union.

He said that a committee of experts is currently selecting the location of this farm.

When answering another question, he also announced that the Indian government is considering a proposal to send a delegation to China to study the development of agricultural cooperatives.

    苏联帮助印度进行生产建设
    新华社新德里2日电“印度时报”3月2日的消息说，苏联帮助印度建设的比莱炼钢厂的生产能力，预料将从原来规定的每年生产100万吨钢锭增加到大约130万吨。此外它还能够生产10万吨到30万吨的铸铣铁。印度政府正在根据苏联专家提出的工程报告来考虑这个问题。
    比莱炼钢厂生产能力增加的主要办法将是建设三座高炉而不是两座。据消息报道，苏联专家说，比莱炼钢厂将应用最现代化的生产技术。现代化的仪器将自动地管理这些高炉。
    这条消息说，可能直接雇用7，300人来完成比莱炼钢厂的工程。估计，这个工程的总价值为11亿卢比，苏联的装备、物资和技术指导价值约为54，000万卢比。
    消息说，这个工厂将在1958年开始生产。这个工厂的设计规定最后把它的钢产量增加到250万吨。
    新华社新德里2日电　印度政府粮食和农业部长阿·普·贾殷3月1日在人民院答复问题的时候说，印度政府打算用苏联供给的机器和装备开办一个大规模的机械化农场。这个农场的面积为26，000英亩到32，000英亩。农场的大部分的机器和装备都已经运到印度。他说，专家委员会正在选择这个农场的地点。
    他在答复另一个问题的时候还宣布，印度政府正在考虑关于派遣代表团到中国研究农业合作社发展情况的建议。
