    India's Solemn Position
    Indian Prime Minister Nehru delivered a speech on foreign affairs in the People's House on the 20th. He expressed clear views on many major international issues of the time and demonstrated India's sincere desire to achieve peaceful coexistence with all countries. This speech will undoubtedly have a positive impact on the development of the current situation in Asia. It shows that India, as one of the world's major powers, is playing an increasingly significant role in international affairs.
    What is currently troubling many countries, and is resolutely opposed by the people of the world and many other countries, is the policy of some countries that are unwilling to abandon the conclusion of military treaties and the establishment of military blocs. This policy, combined with so-called military aid, spreads suspicion everywhere, creates division and discord between countries, provokes arms races, increases the military burden of various countries, disrupts their peaceful construction, and creates tension and unease in international relations. The treaties that are harming Asia are the Manila Treaty, the Baghdad Treaty, and other similar treaties and military aid agreements. Prime Minister Nehru sternly condemned the role of so-called military aid, the Manila Treaty, and the Baghdad Treaty in worsening the situation in Asia. He pointed out that just as the situation in Southeast Asia had eased and people were expecting a return to normalcy, the Manila Treaty appeared at this time and immediately caused tension. This objective judgment reveals the root cause of the tension in Asia.
    It is becoming increasingly difficult for the instigators and organizers of military blocs to cover up the aggressive nature of these organizations with various sophistries. Not long ago, the Manila Treaty Organization issued a report on the first year of this military bloc, and ridiculously claimed that "this treaty has provided a security factor indispensable for economic, social and cultural progress" and "has made an important contribution to maintaining peace in this region." Nehru's speech exposed this lie. His criticism of military treaties represents the common view of many politicians in Asia and Africa. Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser, in a speech on January 28 this year, called the Baghdad Treaty a "large prison for the Arab people." Obviously, changing the policy of military blocs, abolishing military treaties, and seeking peaceful coexistence and collective security are the common demands of all just people in the world. People cannot disagree with Nehru's opinion: "Only by observing and implementing the five principles now known as Panchsheel can there be hope for a new era of international peace and stability."
    Prime Minister Nehru hoped that the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks could make progress, thereby paving the way for discussing other outstanding issues—including a meeting between the foreign ministers of the two countries. He condemned the so-called "non-recognition policy" towards the People's Republic of China. These are just claims that are beneficial to the cause of peace. As everyone knows, after entering the discussion of the second item on the agenda of the Geneva talks, despite China's many efforts, the talks failed to reach an agreement, and the United States was entirely responsible for this. In the talks, the United States tried every means to deceive China into issuing a so-called statement of non-use of force in order to legitimize the U.S. occupation of Taiwan and obstruct the Chinese people's actions to liberate the coastal islands. This unreasonable demand is of course unacceptable to the Chinese people.
    The main reason for the instability in the Indochina situation is that the Geneva Agreement's provisions on consultations for national elections in Vietnam are being unreasonably undermined. Not long ago, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, with the support of the United States, conducted a unilateral "election" in an attempt to circumvent the solemn obligations of the Geneva Agreement. Nehru stated that India has no intention of shirking its responsibilities as chairman of the International Commission and hopes that the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference will meet to discuss the current situation. It is hoped that India's positive attitude will help the implementation of the Geneva Agreement in Indochina.
    Nehru's criticism of colonialism on the Goa issue demonstrates the due dignity of India as a sovereign state. He pointed out that Portugal's arrogance is due to the protection it receives from the United States. He reiterated India's determination to eliminate the remnants of colonialism. The Chinese people fully support India's struggle to recover Goa and unify its motherland.
    In the past years, India has made many contributions to maintaining peace and strengthening international cooperation. India's important position in Asian affairs and international affairs has been universally recognized by international public opinion. We believe that the unity of India, China, and Asian and African countries under the banner of the "Bandung Spirit" will be a powerful guarantee for maintaining peace in the Asian-African region and the world.

    印度的严正立场
    印度总理尼赫鲁二十日在人民院发表了关于外交事务的演说。他对当前许多重大的国际问题表示了明确的见解，并表明了印度要求和各国实现和平共处的恳切愿望。这篇演说无疑地将对当前亚洲局势的发展发生好的影响。它显示了作为世界大国之一的印度在国际事务中正起着日益显著的作用。
    目前困扰着许多国家，并且受到世界人民和另外许多国家坚决反对的东西，就是有些国家死不肯放手的缔结军事条约、建立军事集团的政策。这种政策同所谓军事援助相结合，到处散布疑惧，制造国与国之间的分裂和不和，挑起军备竞赛，增加各国的军费负担，扰乱它们的和平建设，制造国际关系的紧张和不安。正在祸害亚洲的这种条约就是马尼拉条约、巴格达条约和其他一些类似的条约和军援协定等等。尼赫鲁总理严正地谴责了所谓军事援助、马尼拉条约和巴格达条约在恶化亚洲局势中的作用。他指出正当东南亚局势已经有了缓和，人民在期望恢复正常状态的时候，马尼拉条约就在这个时候出现了，并且立即引起紧张局势。这一客观的论断，揭示出了亚洲局势紧张的根本原因。
    军事集团的策动者和组织者，想以各种诡辩来掩盖这些组织的侵略本质是愈来愈困难了。不久以前，马尼拉条约组织发表关于这个军事集团第一个年度的报告，还荒唐地宣称“这个条约已经提供一个为经济、社会和文化进展所不可缺少的安全因素”，“已经对保持这个地区的和平作出了重要的贡献”。尼赫鲁的演说揭穿了这种谎言。他指责军事条约的意见，代表了亚非地区许多政治家的共同见解。埃及总理纳赛尔在今年一月二十八日发表谈话时，把巴格达条约叫做“阿拉伯各国人民的大监狱”。很明显，改变军事集团政策、废止军事条约、谋求和平共处和集体安全是全世界正义人类的共同要求。人们不会不同意尼赫鲁的意见：“只有遵守和实行现在大家都知道的叫做潘查希拉的五项原则，才有希望出现国际和平和安定的新时代。”
    尼赫鲁总理希望中美大使级会谈能够取得进展，从而为讨论其他未决问题——包括两国外长的会晤在内——铺平道路。他谴责了对中华人民共和国的所谓“不承认政策”。这些都是有利于和平事业的正义主张。大家知道，日内瓦会谈在进入第二项议程的讨论之后，尽管中国作了许多次的努力，但是会谈还是未能达成协议，这完全该美国负责。美国在会谈中用种种办法力图骗中国发表一个所谓不使用武力的声明，以便使美国侵占台湾，并且阻挠中国人民解放沿海岛屿的行为合法化。这一无理要求当然是中国人民不能接受的。
    印度支那局势不稳定的主要原因，是日内瓦协议关于就越南全国选举进行协商的规定正遭受到无理的破坏。不久以前，吴庭艳集团在美国的支持下，进行了片面“选举”，企图规避履行日内瓦协议的庄严义务。尼赫鲁表示，印度无意于推卸它作为国际委员会主席所承担的责任，并且希望日内瓦会议的两位主席会晤讨论目前的局势。人们希望，印度的积极态度将有助于日内瓦协议在印度支那的贯彻。
    尼赫鲁在果阿问题上对殖民主义的抨击，表现了印度作为一个主权国家的应有的尊严。他指出葡萄牙的嚣张跋扈，是因为它得到了美国的庇护。他重申了印度一定要肃清殖民主义残余的决心。中国人民完全支持印度要求收复果阿和统一祖国的斗争。
    在过去的年月中，印度已经为维护和平和加强国际合作作出了许多贡献。印度在亚洲事务和国际事务中的重要地位，获得了各国舆论的普遍承认。我们相信，印度、中国和亚非国家在“万隆精神”的旗帜下团结一致，将是维护亚非地区和全世界和平事业的有力保证。
