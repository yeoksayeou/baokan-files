    Should Produce Suitable and Cheap Toothpaste
    Suggestion from reader Yu Shizhong:
    Editor:
    I am a technician at the Shanghai Joint State-Private China Chemical Industry Company. For many years, I have been working on the management and research of toothpaste production technology. Now, I would like to reflect to you some serious waste and unreasonable phenomena existing in China's toothpaste industry.
    Toothpaste is an easy-to-manufacture commodity. For a long time in the past, there were no clear regulations on formulas and operating methods. Capitalists, in order to make more money, engaged in speculation and innovation in production. After liberation, although the China Department Store made some regulations on the specifications of toothpaste, they were all physical properties, such as temperature resistance and cold resistance; as for tooth cleaning efficiency, hygiene conditions, etc., there were no standards. Many manufacturers focus on foam and fragrance, so that the amount of soap flakes (foaming agent), saccharin, menthol, fragrance, and glycerin in some high-end toothpastes currently produced in China greatly exceeds the amount of these ingredients in toothpastes in other countries.
    Of course, good toothpaste needs a certain amount of lather and fragrance. However, excessive lather can irritate the user's mouth and make the toothpaste prone to hardening, water separation, and deterioration; because more soap is used, more mint has to be used, which increases the cost of toothpaste. Excessive use of fragrance is an even greater waste. Currently, in addition to using domestic orange oil in toothpaste, imported lemon oil, citral, etc. are also used, which are actually unnecessary. In addition, some toothpaste factories, in order to produce more foamy toothpaste, have adopted temporary alkalization methods, which often causes the toothpaste to have severe irritation due to excessive alkali, even causing the oral mucosa to break down; or the toothpaste may be prone to rancidity due to insufficient alkali, and the phenomenon of water separation and decomposition is particularly serious in summer.
    At present, the majority of consumers prefer toothpaste with more foam, strong fragrance, and high price. This is the result of long-term deceptive publicity by capitalists, and it also prompts toothpaste factories to focus more on these aspects. For example, the fragrance of White Jade toothpaste attracts a large number of consumers, so toothpaste factories follow suit. Even the China Department Store blindly advocates this practice, calling on factories to increase the foam in toothpaste, without studying what kind of toothpaste is most beneficial to consumers.
    I believe that this erroneous practice of not seeking practical efficacy and wasting raw materials in the toothpaste industry is a capitalist management style and must be corrected immediately. It is hoped that the local industrial department will invite relevant units, toothpaste production technicians, medical personnel, etc., to formulate a toothpaste quality standard based on the principles of strengthening hygiene effects, improving product quality, and reducing production costs, and stipulate correct manufacturing methods. This will enable the majority of consumers to buy practical and cheap good toothpaste.

      Opinions of the Ministry of Health
    The suggestion from reader Yu Shizhong regarding the improvement of toothpaste production that you reported has been studied by us and we have consulted the Department of Oral Medicine of Beijing Medical College, and we believe it is correct. Now, we put forward the following opinions on the issue of toothpaste specifications in the future:
    First, while formulating toothpaste quality standards, we should consider manufacturing toothpaste powder in large quantities and promoting it. Because the effect of toothpaste powder is the same as that of toothpaste, but it can save materials (such as tin tubes) and reduce costs.
    Second, the pH of toothpaste should generally be slightly alkaline; if the alkalinity is too high, it will irritate the oral mucosa.
    Third, the foaming agent in toothpaste is soap powder. If there is too much soap, it will decompose in saliva to produce caustic alkali or fatty acids, which will irritate the oral mucosa; soap can also destroy salivary enzymes, and it is not good to use toothpaste with a lot of soap frequently. In addition, more foam can increase lubricity and reduce the effect of abrasives. Therefore, toothpaste should retain a certain amount of foam, but it should not pursue excessive foam. The soap powder content should generally not exceed 5% to 10%. In addition, attention should also be paid to the size and hardness of the particles of toothpaste and tooth powder to avoid abrasion of teeth.
    Fourth, the purpose of using fragrance in toothpaste is to increase the user's sense of pleasure, but one should not simply pursue the thickness of the fragrance. The choice of fragrance types should be based on the principle of being suitable, inexpensive, and using domestic products as much as possible.

### 应该生产适用而便宜的牙膏

专栏：读者来信

    应该生产适用而便宜的牙膏
    读者俞士忠的建议编辑同志：
    我是上海市公私合营中国化学工业社的技术员。很多年来，我一直做着牙膏生产技术方面的管理和研究工作。现在，我向你们反映我国牙膏工业中存在的一些严重的浪费现象和不合理现象。
    牙膏是一种制造简易的商品，过去很长时期内，在配方和操作方法上没有明确的规定；资本家为了多赚钱，在生产中投机取巧，标新立异。解放以后，中国百货公司虽然对牙膏的规格作了一些规定，但是也都是物理性能方面的，像耐温、耐寒程度等；至于洁齿效能、卫生条件等方面就没有什么标准。不少制造者就在泡沫、香味等方面下工夫，以致我国目前生产的一些高级牙膏中皂片（泡沫剂）、糖精、薄荷脑、香料和甘油的用量，都大大超出了其他国家牙膏中这些用料的份量。
    当然，好的牙膏需要有一定的皂沫和香味。但是，过多的皂沫却会刺激使用者的口腔，并且使牙膏容易发硬、出水和变质；由于皂质用得多了，又不得不多用薄荷，这就加大了牙膏的成本。香料用得过多更是一个巨大的浪费。目前牙膏中除了用国产的桔子油以外，还要用进口的柠檬油、柠檬醛等，实际上这些都是不必要的。此外，有些牙膏厂为了生产多泡的牙膏，采用了临时碱化的操作方法，这样就往往会使牙膏因为碱多而具有剧烈的刺激性，甚至使口腔粘膜破碎；或者会使牙膏因为碱不足而容易腐臭，每逢夏天出水、分解现象就特别严重。
    目前，广大的消费者喜欢用泡沫多、香味浓、价钱高的牙膏，这是由于资本家长期以来进行欺骗宣传的结果，同时这又促使各牙膏厂更加在这些方面下功夫。例如，白玉牙膏的香味吸引了广大消费者，因此各牙膏厂就群起效尤。甚至中国百货公司也盲目地提倡这种作法，号召各厂增加牙膏中的泡沫，而不研究一下制造怎样的牙膏才是对消费者最有利的。
    我认为，牙膏工业中这种不求实际效用和浪费原料的错误做法，是一种资本主义的经营作风，必须立即纠正。希望地方工业部邀集有关单位和牙膏生产技术人员、医务人员等，根据加强卫生效果、提高产品质量和降低生产成本的原则，制定一个牙膏质量的标准，并且规定正确的制造方法。这样就能够使广大消费者能够买到实用而便宜的好牙膏。
                          俞士忠
      卫生部的意见
    你报读者俞士忠关于改进牙膏生产的建议，经我们研究并且征询北京医学院口腔学系的意见，认为是正确的。现在，我们对今后的牙膏规格的问题提出以下几点意见：
    第一，在制定牙膏质量标准的同时，应当考虑大量地制造牙粉，并且加以推广。因为牙粉的效用和牙膏一样，却能够节约材料（如锡管等），降低成本。
    第二，牙膏的酸碱度一般应为微硷性；如果硷性过高，对口腔粘膜有刺激作用。
    第三，牙膏的发泡剂是皂粉，如果肥皂过多，在唾液中分解产生苛性硷或脂酸，对口腔粘膜有刺激作用；肥皂还能破坏唾液酵酶，经常用含肥皂多的牙膏是不好的。此外，泡沫多能增加润滑性，会降低磨擦剂的作用。因此，牙膏应该保留一定的发泡量，但是不宜追求多泡。皂粉含量一般不应该超过5％到10％。另外，对牙膏牙粉颗粒的大小和硬度也应该加以注意，避免磨损牙齿。
    第四，在牙膏中使用香料，目的是增加使用者的愉快感，但是不应该单纯追求香味的浓厚。选用香料的种类，应当以适用、价廉和尽量采用国产品为原则。　中华人民共和国卫生部
