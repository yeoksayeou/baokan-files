The Yellow River Changes the Face of Kaifeng City
    Zhang Zhuquan

    Kaifeng is an ancient city relying on the Yellow River. In the old days, it constantly suffered from the disasters brought by the Yellow River. Today, it uses the water of the Yellow River to wash away its wounds and let the Yellow River serve it.

    According to historical records, in recent centuries, Kaifeng city has been submerged more than thirty times due to the flooding of the Yellow River, especially since the Ming Dynasty, when the Yellow River caused the greatest harm, and floods frequently threatened Kaifeng. In order to maintain their own interests, the rulers of past dynasties did not hesitate to breach the Yellow River, bringing disaster to the people. In the 15th year of Chongzhen in the Ming Dynasty (1641), the officials of Kaifeng, fearing the rebel forces of King Chuang, breached the Yellow River dike at Heigangkou, and the Yellow River water directly flooded Kaifeng, submerging the entire city, and more than 340,000 of the 370,000 people were drowned. In the 21st year of Daoguang in the Qing Dynasty, the Yellow River breached its banks and surrounded the city for several months. In 1938, Chiang Kai-shek also breached the Huayuankou, and the Yellow River water swallowed up more than 54,000 square kilometers of fertile land in the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, drowning more than 890,000 working people. After many Yellow River disasters, the past prosperity of Kaifeng was destroyed, the river channels were blocked, and the nearby fertile land turned into sandy wasteland and alkaline land. The Yellow River silt gradually accumulated, the riverbed rose, and coupled with the disrepair of the dikes, which were riddled with holes, posed a greater threat to Kaifeng. When it was windy, yellow sand filled the sky, making it dark and gloomy. Every summer, water accumulated in the city and could not be drained, giving off a foul odor and breeding mosquitoes and flies.

    In the era of the Communist Party's leadership, the people of Kaifeng have safely survived several major floods in the past nine years. With the beginning of the Yellow River management, the Hongqiqun Water Diversion Project was completed at Heigangkou in 1953, and the Yellow River water began to serve the people. It obediently flows along the canals to the places where people need it, into the lakes and rivers in the urban area, into the boilers of factories, and into the land that farmers need to irrigate.

    The Yellow River water washed away the accumulated sewage and foul water in Kaifeng city, connected the lakes and rivers in the whole city, and fresh water brought fresh air to people, improving the environmental sanitation of the city. The change of Longting Lake is a clear example. Longting Lake used to be two pools of dark green stagnant water, mixed with garbage. A gentle breeze would bring a stench, and mosquitoes and insects would breed, making it a breeding ground for infectious diseases. Now, it has become a place for people to visit and enjoy the scenery. The Longting Pavilion, which attracts the most tourists, has been renovated and looks brand new and magnificent. On the clear and wide lake surface of Panjia Lake and Yangjia Lake, dozens of游船 (tourist boats) often row back and forth. In the past, this area was barren due to soil alkalization, but now the Yellow River water has also improved the alkaline soil, and the neat green willows and poplars on the four banks of the lake have grown luxuriantly. The residents living near these lakes are most impressed by the fact that the number of mosquitoes has been greatly reduced after the stagnant water became活水 (living water).

    Kaifeng used to have many lakes, but because the alkali content of the lake water was too high, nothing grew. Now, the lakes with an area of about 3,000 mu in the whole city can be used for fish farming or lotus root cultivation. In 1954, more than 200,000 fish fry raised by the government in Longting Lake grew to weigh about 2 jin each after one year. In 1955, another 470,000 fish fry were released into the lake.

    Where the Yellow River water channels flow, water diversion stations for factories and basic construction sites have been established one after another, and the Yellow River water has replaced the spring water with excessive alkali content for industrial use. In the past, the Kaifeng Power Plant used spring water with high alkalinity and hardness, and the machines needed to be shut down for maintenance at least once a month, affecting normal power supply. After using Yellow River water, it only needs to be overhauled once a quarter, which not only improves production, but also plays a significant role in the maintenance and conservation of machines.

    In the past, standing on the city wall and looking at the suburbs, one could only see patches of sandy wasteland. Now, visiting the suburbs again, one will see neat windbreak and sand-fixation forest belts and crisscrossing irrigation channels. Last year, the suburban farmland of Kaifeng irrigated by the Yellow River water, more than 5,000 mu, generally achieved a bumper harvest, with an average increase of 60 jin per mu. In order to strive for greater increase in production, the irrigated area in Kaifeng suburbs will be expanded to 15,000 mu this spring.

    In Kaifeng, both inside and outside the city, in factories and villages, new scenes brought by the Yellow River water can be seen everywhere. The disasters brought to Kaifeng by the Yellow River will forever become historical records. The changes in Kaifeng in just two years are only a beginning of our management and development of the Yellow River. After we complete the plan to completely control and develop the Yellow River, Kaifeng will become a garden-like city. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people of Kaifeng are full of confidence in building their beautiful city. (Attached picture)

### 黄河水改变了开封市的面貌

    黄河水改变了开封市的面貌
    张祝泉
    开封是靠着黄河的一座古城，它在旧的时代里曾经不断遭受黄河带来的苦难；今天它又用黄河的水洗刷了自己的创伤，让黄河为自己服务。
    据历史记载，近数百年来开封城因黄河泛滥，曾被淹没过三十多次，特别是自明朝以来黄河为害最大，水灾经常威胁开封。历代统治者为了维护自己利益更不惜扒开黄河，给人民带来灾难。明崇祯15年（1641年）开封的官吏害怕闯王起义的兵马，便把黑岗口黄河堤扒开，黄水直灌开封，全城淹没，37万多人被淹毙了34万。清道光21年黄水决堤曾围城数月。1938年蒋介石也扒开过花园口，黄河水吞没了豫皖苏三省54，000多平方公里的沃土，淹死89万多劳动人民。经过许多次黄水为害，开封过去的繁盛面貌被摧残了，河道淤塞，附近的良田变成了沙荒和碱地。黄河泥沙逐渐淤积，河床抬高，加上大堤失修，千疮百孔，给开封以更大的威胁。遇到风天，黄沙漫野，刮得天昏地暗，每到夏天，城内积水无法排出，臭气四溢，蚊蝇孳生。
    在共产党领导的时代里，九年来开封人民安然度过了几次大汛。随着治理黄河的开始，1953年在黑岗口又修成了虹吸引黄工程，黄河水开始为人民服务，它驯顺地按着渠道流到人们需要它的地方，流入市区的湖泊河道，流入工厂的锅炉，流入农民需要灌溉的土地里。
    黄河水把开封城的积污臭水冲走，沟通了全市的湖泊和河流，新鲜的活水给人们带来新鲜的空气，改善了这座城市的环境卫生。龙亭湖的变化就是一个显明的例证。龙亭湖过去是两潭颜色暗绿的死水，间杂着垃圾，轻风一吹就会送来一阵臭气，蚊虫繁殖，是个传染疾病的渊薮。如今，这里已经变成人们游逛风景的地方了。游人最多的龙亭被修葺得焕然一新，金碧辉煌，潘家湖、杨家湖清澈宽阔的湖面上，经常有数十只游船划来划去。这一带过去因为土壤碱化，寸草不生，现在黄河水也同样改良了碱化的土壤，湖四岸齐整的绿柳、白杨已茂密地生长起来。住在这些湖泊附近的居民们印象最深的是，死水变活水以后，蚊子大大减少了。
    开封过去湖泊虽多，但是因为湖水含碱质太大，什么也不长，现在全市约有3，000亩面积的湖泊都可以利用养鱼或种植莲藕。1954年政府在龙亭湖里养的20多万尾鱼秧，经过一年，每条鱼都长得重2斤左右。1955年又有47万尾鱼秧撒到湖里。
    在黄河水渠道流通的地方，工厂、基本建设工地的引水站一个个地建立起来，黄河水代替了含碱质过大的泉水供工业使用。开封电厂过去用的泉水因碱度、硬度大，机器至少一月就需要停车检修一次，影响正常供电；使用黄河水以后，只需要一季度检修一次，不但提高了生产，对机器的养护和节约都起很大作用。
    过去，站在城墙上往郊外看，只能看见一片片的沙荒；现在再到郊外参观一下，会看到整齐的防风防沙林带和纵横交错的灌溉渠道。去年黄河水灌溉的郊区5，000多亩农田，普遍得到丰收，平均每亩增产60斤。为了争取更大的增产，今春开封郊区灌溉面积将扩大到15，000亩。
    在开封，城里城外，工厂农村，到处都可以看出黄河水带给城市的新的景象。黄河带给开封的灾难将永远成为历史上的记载。开封短短两年间的变化只是我们治理开发黄河的一个开端，在我们完成根治和开发黄河计划之后，开封将会变成一座花园似的城市。开封人民在共产党的领导下正满怀信心地建设着自己美好的城市。（附图片）
