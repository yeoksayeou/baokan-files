    A Good Proposal for Cultivating Technical Talent
    Kong Sang
    Using the "master-apprentice" method in practical work to cultivate technical talent is a most frequent, widespread, and demonstrably effective approach. This method has excellent traditions in our country, is familiar to the masses, and is deeply welcomed by them. However, in the past, this method was mostly limited to veteran skilled workers and young apprentices; it was not very common among engineers and technicians, or between technicians and workers.
    Cao Cunchang, an engineer in the gearbox workshop of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, after a long period of research and careful planning, proposed the use of the "chain teaching method" to cultivate more technical talent for the country. This is a very meaningful proposal. In places where there are no spare-time technical schools, implementing this method can immediately organize the work of improving the technical level of employees at all levels. Where there are spare-time technical schools, it can also become a good auxiliary method. Its advantages are significant in closely combining with practical work, adapting to the characteristics of each individual, and not being limited by time and place.
    At present, our country's cultural and economic construction tasks are very heavy, and only by relying on the strength of the masses can we complete such tasks. To rapidly and comprehensively improve the technical level of our vast number of employees, we cannot rely solely on top-down administrative power, but mainly on the enthusiasm and initiative of the millions of masses, especially the power of the vast number of senior technical personnel. Therefore, from this point of view, responding to the proposal of Engineer Cao Cunchang and widely promoting the method he proposed has even greater significance.
    Now, the gearbox workshop has comprehensively implemented this method, and many technicians have put forward guarantees. Cao Cunchang has already taken two technicians as apprentices in accordance with his own proposal. The entire First Automobile Manufacturing Plant is also promoting this method. We hope that more technical personnel will respond to Engineer Cao Cunchang's proposal and set off a universally high-spirited upsurge of learning technology in all our enterprises.

    一个关于培养技术人材的好倡议
    孔桑
    在实际工作中用“师傅带徒弟”的办法来培养技术人材，是一种最经常、最广泛，并且能收到显著效果的方式；这种方式在我国有优良的传统，为群众所熟悉，而且深受群众欢迎。但是，过去这种方式多局限在老技术工人和青年徒工之间；在工程师和技术员之间、技术员和工人之间，则很不普遍。
    第一汽车制造厂变速箱车间工程师曹存昌经过长时期的研究和周密的计划，提出了用“连锁传授法”来为国家培养更多的技术人材的倡议。这是一个很有意义的倡议。在没有业余技术学校的地方，实行这种办法，可以立即把提高各级职工技术水平的工作组织起来。有业余技术学校的地方，它也可以成为一种很好的辅助方式。而在密切结合实际工作，适应每个人的特点，不受时间、地点的限制等方面，它的优点是很显著的。
    目前，我国的文化和经济建设任务十分繁重，只有依靠群众的力量，才能完成这样的任务。而要迅速地、全面地提高我国广大职工的技术水平，同样不能只依靠从上而下的行政力量，而主要地要依靠千百万群众的积极性和主动精神，尤其是要依靠广大高级技术人员的力量。因此，从这一点上来估价，响应曹存昌工程师的倡议，以及广泛推行他提出的办法，就有了更为重要的意义。
    现在，变速箱车间已经全面地推行了这个办法，许多技术人员都提出了保证条件。曹存昌已经按照自己的倡议，带了两名技术员。第一汽车制造厂全厂也在推行这个办法。我们希望：有更多的从事技术工作的人员响应曹存昌工程师的倡议，在我们所有的企业当中，掀起普遍高涨的、学习技术的热潮。
