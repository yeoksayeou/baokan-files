The publication of the "Selected Essays and Features" allows everyone to see a collection of relatively excellent essays and features published in the past two years, and to see the main achievements of our literary light cavalry in the past two years. This is very meaningful. Because this kind of literary style, which can quickly reflect realistic changes and is the most diverse and combative, is precisely what we should vigorously promote today.

The 55 essays and features by more than 50 authors collected in this selection are mostly vivid portrayals of the exciting life, work, and struggles in various aspects of the motherland. The editors have categorized and arranged them according to the nature of the works' themes. There are sketches of rural life centered on the agricultural cooperation movement, depictions of intense industrial and mining life and exploration work; powerful depictions of the solemn struggle to defend the motherland, enthusiastic eulogies of the fresh things of the "era of fairy tales" and the beautiful life of ethnic minorities, as well as cordial concern for outstanding international peace fighters and fierce condemnation of the enemies of peace. After reading these works, we deeply appreciate the glory of building a new life, and we also deeply appreciate the hardship of building a new life. The magnificence of the spiritual outlook of the people who are tempered, growing, and leaping forward in the midst of hardship makes us feel excited and inspired. From the glorious people and events reflected in these works, we feel such warmth and strength!

Compared with the ever-changing and radiant reality, what is reflected in this 601-page selection is only a drop in the ocean. However, even here, we see such a vast world, such lofty realms, so many dazzling people and things! We see how the district chief in the mountainous area "carries his luggage roll on a stick," climbs over mountains and ridges, and leads the masses to carry out the cooperation movement, calling "barren mountains into gold mountains." We see how the power of the combine harvester "forces" the primary cooperatives to develop into advanced cooperatives. We see how the "masters of the mines" use rich production experience and outstanding labor wisdom to overcome conservative ideas and complete arduous production tasks ahead of schedule. We see how the prospecting teams on the Gobi desert discover the "pride of the motherland" in the desert, and discover endless underground treasures. We see how the liberated peasants of the Li ethnic group choose a "floral pen" ballpoint pen for their daughter who is entering a people's school in the cooperative. We see how a soldier who had two feet and nine fingers amputated refused to recuperate, studied hard, and finally became an editor in the preliminary education section of the Veterans' General School. ...Such people and events have such profound educational significance for the builders of the new society! The light cavalry on our literary and artistic front understands its responsibilities.

Among the authors in this selection, we see many familiar names, and we also see many new faces, which is the characteristic of the literary light cavalry. Essays and features are the most unrestrained literary styles, and a wider range of authors should be able to master this style. In the literary light cavalry galloping on the fields of life in various aspects, a large number of newcomers should continue to emerge. Of course, we cannot conclude from this that this literary style is a relatively low-level style, and that this type of work can only be written by beginners, and has nothing to do with experienced and accomplished veteran writers. The facts provided in this selection refute such an argument. Everyone knows that the quality of literary works is not determined by style, but by quality. For beginners, styles such as features are relatively easy to master, while for experienced writers, this style will never limit the full发挥 of their writing ability. We can find evidence in this selection.

The authors of features that reflect real people and real events or are based on real people and real events particularly need direct life experience. No one can shut themselves in a room and fabricate the plot of a feature. Taking the authors of this selection as an example, without direct contact with Wang Yonghuai, without a serious investigation and research on Wang Yonghuai's deeds, how could one write "Wang Yonghuai"? Without direct experience of the prospecting life on the Gobi Desert, how could one write "The Prospecting Team on the Gobi Desert"? Without directly understanding Liao Yixun's life, could one write "An Unfinished Book"? Naturally, this is not to say that good features can be written with direct experience alone, and that artistic processing is insignificant for features that reflect real people and real events. Depicting real people and real events is not easy, and writing well is definitely not less laborious than writing other literary works. A feature is not a photograph, but a sketch. The author needs the eye to observe things and the ability to analyze things, and the ability to tailor materials, highlight themes, use artistic colors, and infuse the author's thoughts and feelings. Because it is writing about real people and real events or based on real people and real events, even authors with less writing experience can easily start writing and are easy to exercise; and because it is writing about literary works, literary masters also have room to use their talents. Literary styles such as features should become literary weapons commonly used by new and old writers and the vast number of newcomers. The "Selected Essays and Features" provides a good example.

Our feature literature is still very young and needs the enthusiastic cultivation of literary leadership organizations, newspaper and magazine editorial departments, and the vast number of authors. Our literary light cavalry is not strong enough, the life that features touch is not extensive enough, and features that boldly expose the contradictions in the new life are especially lacking. We have not yet seen anyone use the vivid and powerful feature form to raise major issues in life, work, and ideological style. Our era is an era of rapid storms. In the ocean of life and struggle of our people, fresh and eye-catching waves are surging every day. Our literary light cavalry has already gained a lot of harvest, and will definitely be able to continuously expand its team under the urgent demands of the vast number of readers, and continue to move forward more bravely.

    前进，文艺轻骑队
    ——中国作家协会编选的“散文特写选”读后——
    林淡秋
    “散文特写选”的出版，使大家能够集中地看到最近两年间发表的比较优秀的散文、特写作品，看到我们的文艺轻骑队两年来的主要收获，这是很有意义的事。因为这种能够迅速反映现实变化、最富有多样性和战斗性的文艺样式，正是我们今天应该大力提倡的。
    收在这部选集里的50多位作者的55篇散文、特写，大都是祖国各方面激动人心的生活、工作和斗争的生动写照，编选者依照作品题材的性质加以归类编排。有以农业合作化运动为中心的农村生活的速写，有紧张的工矿生活和勘探工作的描绘；有保卫祖国的庄严斗争事迹的有力刻划，有对“童话的时代”的新鲜事物和少数民族的美好生活的热情歌颂，也有对国际出色的和平斗士的亲切关怀和对和平敌人的猛烈鞭挞。读了这些作品，我们深深体会到建设新生活的荣耀，也深深体会到建设新生活的艰辛，而在艰辛中锻炼、成长、跃进的人们的精神面貌的壮美，更使我们感到激动和振奋。从这些作品所反映的光辉的人事中，我们感受到怎样的热和力！
    同日新月异、光芒四射的现实生活比较起来，这部601页选集所反映的，不过是沧海一粟。然而即使在这里，我们也看到多么广阔的天地，多么崇高的境界，多少耀眼的人和事！我们看到山区的区长怎样“用棍子挑着行李卷儿”翻山过岭，带领群众开展合作化运动，叫“荒山变成金山”。我们看到联合收割机的威力怎样“逼着”初级社发展成高级社。我们看到“矿山的主人”们怎样用丰富的生产经验和出色的劳动智慧来战胜保守思想，提前完成艰巨的生产任务。我们看到戈壁滩上的探矿队怎样在沙漠中发现“祖国的骄傲”，发现无穷无尽的地下宝藏。我们看到黎族的翻身农民怎样在合作社里为进民校的女儿挑选“花杆儿”的自来水笔。我们看到被锯掉两脚和九个手指的战士怎样拒绝休养，苦学苦练，终于成为荣军总校初教科的编辑。……诸如此类的人和事，对于新社会的建设者们，有多么深刻的教育意义！我们文艺战线上的轻骑队是懂得自己的责任的。
    在这部选集的作者们中，我们看到许多熟悉的名字，也看到不少新人，这正是文艺轻骑队的特色。散文、特写是最不受拘束的文艺样式，应该有较广大的作者能够掌握这种样式。奔驰在各方面生活原野上的文艺轻骑队中，应该不断涌现大批大批的新人。自然，我们不能由此得出结论，说这种文艺样式是比较低级的样式，这一类作品只能由初学写作者去写，跟有经验、有成就的老作家无关。这部选集所提供的事实，就驳斥了这样的论点。大家知道文艺作品的高低不是决定于样式，而是决定于质量。对初学写作者来说，特写一类的样式是比较容易掌握的，而对于老练的作家来说，这种样式也决不会限制他的写作能力的充分发挥。我们可以在这部选集里找到证据。
    反映真人实事或以真人实事为基础的特写的作者，特别需要直接的生活经历，谁也不能关在房里虚构出一篇特写的情节来。以这部选集的作者们为例，不跟王永淮直接接触，不对王永淮的事迹直接进行认真的调查研究，怎能写出“王永淮”？没有戈壁滩上的探矿生活的直接体验，怎能写出“戈壁滩上的探矿队”？不直接了解廖贻训的一生，难道能够写出“一部尚未写完的书”？自然，这不是说，光有直接经历，就可以写出好特写来，而艺术加工对于反映真人实事的特写是无足重轻的。描写真人实事并不容易，要写得好，决不比写其他文艺作品更省力。特写不是照相，而是写生画。作者需要观察事物的眼力和分析事物的能力，需要剪裁材料、突出主题、运用艺术色彩、灌注作者的思想感情的本领。因为写真人实事或以真人实事为基础，所以即使较少写作经验的作者，也比较易于动笔，便于锻炼；又因为写的是文艺作品，所以文学大师也有用武之地。特写一类的文艺样式，应该成为新、老作家和广大新人共同使用的文艺武器。“散文特写选”便提供了一个好的榜样。
    我们的特写文学还很年轻，需要文艺界领导机构、报刊编辑部和广大作者的热情培育。我们的文艺轻骑队还不够壮大，特写所接触的生活还不够广泛，而大胆揭露新生活中的矛盾的特写，尤其缺乏。我们还没有看到有人通过生动有力的特写形式提出生活上、工作上和思想作风上的重大问题。我们的时代是急风暴雨的时代，在我国人民的生活和斗争的海洋中，每天都激荡着新鲜触目的波澜。我们的文艺轻骑队已经得到了不少的收获，一定能够在广大读者的迫切要求下不断扩大自己的队伍，更勇敢地继续前进。
