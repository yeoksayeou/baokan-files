    Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi Jointly Prevent and Control Cotton Bollworm
    Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces jointly formed the Cotton Bollworm Joint Prevention Committee in January. The joint prevention area is along both banks of the Yangtze River, extending more than 400 li from Guangji County in Hubei to Huaining County in Anhui, including more than 590,000 mu of cotton fields in 10 counties bordering the three provinces, such as Huangmei, Jiujiang, and Susong. Various tasks to prevent and control overwintering cotton bollworms have been carried out within the joint prevention area. Susong County has generally sprayed pesticides four or five times in all cotton ginning mills, oil pressing factories, and other cotton storage places, and has thoroughly disposed of dead bolls and waste seeds.

    湖北、安徽、江西联合防除红铃虫
    湖北、安徽、江西三省在1月共同组成了棉花红铃虫联防委员会。联防地区沿长江两岸，从湖北广济县到安徽怀宁县，全长400多里，包括三省毗连的黄梅、九江、宿松等10个县的59万多亩棉田。在联防地区内，进行了各种防除越冬红铃虫的工作。宿松县已经在所有轧花厂、榨油厂和其他贮棉场所普遍喷药四、五次，并对枯铃和废籽进行彻底的处理。
