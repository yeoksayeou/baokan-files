    Hurry and Repair the Leaky Dormitories

    To the Editorial Comrades:

    The Mudanjiang Branch of the Harbin Railway Bureau organized a "Self-Construction Public Assistance" committee last year and built a batch of employee dormitories. Due to poor planning on the part of the leadership, many houses were started when the ground was already freezing in the mornings and evenings, so the quality is very poor. Some houses now have holes in all four walls, and the walls are collapsing and the beams are broken. A rain or snow makes the roofs leak incessantly. The employees and their families who live in these dormitories are extremely distressed: some rooms leak water all day long, and the residents have to squeeze into one corner of the room to sleep at night; some rooms also frequently drop mud, and if they are unlucky, mud blocks will overturn the pot when cooking during the day. As a result, some residents seek relatives and friends to find accommodation; others rent private houses at high prices.

    The residents have repeatedly reported this serious situation to the leadership, but the problem has not been resolved. Recently, the leaders of the "Self-Construction Public Assistance" committee seem to have paid attention to this problem. Around the Spring Festival, they conducted "visits" and "consolations" with us. We are very grateful for this concern. But what we need is a quick solution to our actual difficulties. We hope that the leadership can truly take this responsibility.

### 赶快修补破漏的宿舍

    赶快修补破漏的宿舍编辑同志：
    哈尔滨铁路管理局牡丹江分局去年组织了“自建公助”委员会，建筑了一批职工宿舍。由于领导方面计划不周，很多房子是在早晚已经上冻的季节才破土动工的，因此质量很差，有些房子现在已经是四壁洞穿、墙塌梁折，有一场雨雪更是屋漏如注了。住进这些宿舍的职工和家属苦恼极了：有的屋子整天漏水，住户晚上睡觉只好全家挤在一个屋角里；有的屋子还经常掉泥，白天做饭的时候碰不巧泥块就打翻了锅。这样，有的住户就求亲访友出去找宿；有的就另花高价租住民房。
    住户们曾经不断把这种严重情况向领导方面反映，但是问题一直没有解决。最近“自建公助”委员会的领导者似乎是注意了这个问题，他们在春节前后，对我们进行了“访问”和“安慰”。我们对这种关怀很感谢。但是我们需要的是迅速解决我们的实际困难问题。希望领导方面能够切实负起这个责任来。
