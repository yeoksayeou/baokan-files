Why Not Follow Regulations for Work Assessment?

Editor:

    Correctly implementing the state's wage policy is the material foundation for continuously pushing the enthusiasm for labor to new heights. However, many mines under the Datong Mining Bureau have long-standing irrational phenomena such as unsound assessment systems and failure to upgrade workers' wages according to regulations. In Datong No. 2 Mine, there are 5 workers in No. 3 well and 6 workers in No. 6 well who should have been upgraded but were not. Chen Yutian, a coal cutting machine operator in No. 3 well, was already a level-6 worker in 1951; now he has been promoted to the position of team leader, but he is still a level-6 worker. Zhu Fuyuan of Datong No. 4 Mine was a level-2 worker, and was later transferred to pushing carts underground. He should have been promoted to a level-5 worker, but it took 10 months to resolve the issue. In addition, workers in job categories with only one grade (such as coal pushers and chute loaders) can only have their wage grades changed when they are transferred or change job categories; their wage grades cannot be changed in the long term. This is unreasonable. In fact, these workers are the main workers in the extraction areas and roadways. Moreover, section chiefs often don't allow workers who are active and perform well to be transferred out. Therefore, the workers say: If you do this kind of work, don't even think about upgrading in ten years.

    为什么不按规定考工编辑同志：
    正确地执行国家的工资政策，是把劳动积极性不断推向新的高涨的物质基础。但是，大同矿务局的不少矿井却长期存在着考核制度不健全、不按规定考工升级等不合理现象。大同二矿应该升级而没有升级的工人，三号井有5名，六号井有6名。三号井割煤机司机陈玉田，1951年就是六级工；现在他已经担任了组长的职务，但是仍然是六级工。大同四矿朱富源是二级工，后来调到井下推车，按理应升为五级工，但是拖了10个月之久才解决。此外，只有一个等级的工种（推煤工、装溜子工等）的工人，除了因为调动工作、变更工种而跟着变更工资以外，工资等级长期不能变动。这是不合理的。实际上这些工人在回采区和巷道里都是主要工人。而且表现积极的工人，区长往往不放他们外调。因此工人们说：干这个工种的活，十年也别想升级。　		同　联
