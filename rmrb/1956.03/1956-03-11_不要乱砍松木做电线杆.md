    Do Not Recklessly Cut Pine Trees for Utility Poles

    To the Editor:
    A few days before the Spring Festival, farmers in Xinmin, Xinli, Maosheng, Lianhe, Changjiang, and Gongrong villages of Wenchun District, Ning'an County, Heilongjiang Province, cut down many trees in the Laoye Ridge forest to make utility poles needed for establishing broadcasting and telephone networks. According to clear government regulations: the wooden poles required for establishing broadcasting and telephone networks are only permitted to use standing dead trees (that is, dead and withered trees) and fallen timber within the forest; if there are really no standing dead trees or fallen timber, then some broad-leaved forests, such as poplar, birch, and oak trees, can be felled. However, Lin Guojun, the Secretary of the Wenchun District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in order to complete the task of building broadcasting and telephone poles, disregarded national laws and, at a meeting of village cadres in the district, called on all farmers in the district to cut down 1,800 red and white pine trees, with specifications of 8 meters long and 12 centimeters or more in diameter. As a result, the farmers in this district went to Laoye Ridge to cut down a large number of trees, severely damaging the country's forest resources. Fortunately, the cadres of Jiefang Village in the neighboring Langang District discovered this and reported it to the County People's Committee for a stop. At this time, the farmers in Wenchun District had already cut down more than 500 pieces of timber, including many of the finest red pine and a batch of white pine, all of which are important materials very much needed in construction.

    不要乱砍松木做电线杆编辑同志：
    春节前几天，黑龙江省宁安县温春区的新民、新立、茂盛、联合、长江、共荣等村农民在老爷岭森林里砍了很多的树木，做建立广播网、电话网所需要的电线杆。按照政府明文规定：建立广播网、电话网所需用的木杆，只准利用林内的站杆（就是死掉的枯树）和倒木；如果实在没有站杆和倒木，才可以采伐一些阔叶林，如杨树、桦树、柞树等。但是，中共温春区委书记林国军为了完成建设广播网和电话杆的任务，竟不顾国家法令，在这个区的村干部会议上号召全区农民砍伐1，800根红白松树，规格要长8公尺、粗12公分以上。于是，这个区的农民就到老爷岭去大砍林木，严重破坏了祖国的森林资源。幸亏邻近的兰冈区解放村的干部发现了，才报请县人民委员会予以制止。这时，温春区的农民已经砍下500多根木材，其中有不少最上等的红松和一批白松，都是建筑上很需要的重要材料。　赫重运
