    High Processing Fees for New Style Clothing

    To the Editor:
    We are several young women who would like to wear beautiful and varied clothing. However, currently, the processing fees for making newly designed clothes at tailor shops are many times more expensive than making a set of blue uniforms. For example, the processing fee for making a very ordinary cloth "Bula Ji" (dress) costs 3 to 4 yuan; if it is made of linen or silk, the labor cost will be 6 yuan or even 10 yuan. In this way, the processing fee is more than the cost of the fabric. Of course, the amount of the processing fee is related to the simplicity or complexity of the cutting and sewing; however, making a "Bula Ji" is not more complicated than making a set of uniforms. So, what is the reason for this? We believe that the main reason is that sewing workers are not familiar with how to make some of the newly designed clothes. Therefore, we suggest that relevant departments organize sewing workers to learn how to make new style clothes, and reasonably adjust the processing fees for clothing.

### 新式服装加工费太高

    新式服装加工费太高编辑同志：
    我们是几个女青年，我们愿意穿美丽的丰富多采的服装。但是，目前到缝纫店去做新设计式样的衣服，加工费要比做一套蓝制服贵好多倍。比如，要做一件很普通的布的“布拉吉”，加工费就要3元到4元；如果做麻料或绸料的，工钱就要6元甚至10元。这样，加工费比买布的钱还要多。当然，加工费的高低同裁剪、缝制的简繁有关；但是，做一件“布拉吉”并不比做一套制服更复杂。那末，原因在那里呢？我们认为主要是缝纫工人对某些新设计的服装的做法不熟悉。因此，我们建议有关部门组织缝纫工人学习新式衣服的做法，并且合理地调整衣服的加工费用。
