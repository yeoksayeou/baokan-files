Xinhua News Agency, Nicosia: British colonial authorities exiled Archbishop Makarios of Cyprus on March 9th. British authorities said that the destination of the plane carrying Makarios would be "announced later."

Makarios is one of the leaders of the Cypriot self-determination movement. Britain took this action after its negotiations with Makarios on the future of Cyprus broke down.

According to Reuters, after the news of the British authorities' deportation of Makarios spread like lightning in Nicosia on the 9th, the bells of local Greek churches rang one after another. Hundreds of angry people immediately rushed to the Archbishop's residence to bid him farewell, shouting slogans such as "Long live the Cypriot national self-determination movement!"

According to Agence France-Presse, all Greek political figures were shocked by the news of Britain's exile of Makarios. Opposition figures have called for a meeting of all party leaders to draft a "national resolution."

The Greek government held a meeting on the evening of the 9th. A communique issued after the meeting condemned the British measure of exiling Makarios, considering it "an act of violence inconsistent with current civilization." The Foreign Minister announced after the meeting that the Greek government had decided to recall the Greek Ambassador to London in protest against this measure. The government has also instructed the Greek representative to the United Nations to immediately submit a new appeal to the United Nations on the Cyprus issue, and to protest the exile of Makarios to the United Nations Secretary-General and the Security Council.

    英殖民当局把塞浦路斯大主教马卡里奥斯驱逐出境
    据新华社讯　尼科西亚消息：英国殖民当局3月9日把塞浦路斯大主教马卡里奥斯驱逐出境。英国当局说，押解马卡里奥斯离境的飞机到达的目的地“将在以后宣布”。
    马卡里奥斯是塞浦路斯要求自决运动的领导人之一。英国在它同马卡里奥斯关于塞浦路斯前途问题的谈判破裂以后采取了这个行动。
    据路透社报道，英国当局驱逐马卡里奥斯出境的消息9日像闪电似地在尼科西亚传开以后，当地希腊教堂的钟一个接着一个地响起来。数以百计的愤怒的人群立即赶到大主教的住所向他告别，人们高喊塞浦路斯民族自决运动万岁的口号。
    据法新社报道，希腊的所有政界人士都对英国放逐马卡里奥斯的消息感到震惊。反对党人士要求举行一次所有党派领袖的会议，来草拟“全国的决议”。
    希腊政府在9日晚举行了会议。会后发表的公报里谴责英国放逐马卡里奥斯的措施，认为这是“一种同现行文明不协调的暴力行动”。外交大臣在会后宣布，希腊政府为了抗议这个措施，已经决定召回希腊驻伦敦大使。政府并且已经训令希腊驻联合国代表就塞浦路斯问题立即向联合国提出一项新的呼吁，并且对放逐马卡里奥斯一事向联合国秘书长和安全理事会提出抗议。
