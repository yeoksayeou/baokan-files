    In the Past Year, Chinese Writers Have Created Many New Works
    The person in charge of the Chinese Writers Association told Xinhua News Agency reporters that in the past year, writers have created many new works reflecting socialist construction and socialist transformation. The People's Literature Publishing House, China Youth Publishing House, Popular Reading Publishing House, New Literature Publishing House, and Children's Publishing House alone published more than 470 newly created literary works in the past year, with a total circulation of more than 23 million copies.
    In the past year, writers have created more than 10 novellas and novels reflecting agricultural cooperativization. Zhao Shuli's "Sanliwan," Ouyang Shan's "A Bright Future," Wang Xijian's "Welcoming Spring Melody," Li Zhun's "Ice Melting and Snow Dissolving," and Liu Shaotang's "The Sound of Oars on the Canal" and other novels have been welcomed by readers after their publication. "Sanliwan" has sold 380,000 copies since its publication last year, making it the literary book with the largest circulation in the past year.
    Among the many works reflecting industrial construction and the life of the armed forces are the novels Zhou Libo's "Iron Water Flows," Ma Jia's "In the East of the Motherland," Zhou Jiefu's "Towards Victory," Han Feng's "East Line," and the collection of short stories Liu Baiyu's "The Happiness of Fighting," and Jun Qing's "The Riverbank at Dawn."
    Poetry creation is even more active. Readers have seen many excellent lyric poems, narrative poems, and political satire poems. In addition to many older generation poets constantly publishing works, new poets have emerged, including Wen Jie, Gu Gong, Shao Yanxiang, Zhang Yongmei, and Wei Yang, among others.
    With the development of the movement to eliminate counter-revolutionaries, writers have created many thriller novels, essays, and political commentaries.
    Children's literature has gained new development in the past year. The Children's Publishing House alone has published 112 new works. Xie Liming's "Fiery Heart," Liu Zhen's "Me and Xiao Rong," and other novels have been welcomed by young readers after their publication.
