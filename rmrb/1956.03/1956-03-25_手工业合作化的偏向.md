    Deviations in the Cooperative Transformation of Handicraft Industries
    Recently, Jishan County in Shanxi Province gathered all the blacksmiths within a forty-li radius, preventing them from going to the countryside for production. Farmers dissatisfiedly said: It's good to organize, but the more organized, the further away things get. In Taiyuan City, some streets have even concentrated the sesame cake sellers. Citizens have to travel a long distance and stand in line just to buy a sesame cake. After artificially alienating the natural connection between handicraftsmen and the masses, both the handicraftsmen and the masses feel inconvenienced.
    The reason for this phenomenon is that some comrades responsible for leading the transformation of handicrafts mechanically believe that since "cooperativization" has occurred, production and management must be uniformly centralized. They do not understand that the type of production and management methods adopted depends on what is conducive to developing production and beneficial to the lives of the masses. Forgetting this fundamental purpose and only acting based on subjective "wishful thinking" will naturally only lead to ruining things.

    手工业合作化的偏向
    最近，山西稷山县把四十里以内的铁匠都集中了起来，不让他们下乡生产。农民不满意地说：组织起来好，越组织越远了。太原市有的街上把卖烧饼的也集中起来了。市民要买个烧饼得跑很远的路，还要排队。这样人为地疏远了手工业者同群众的自然联系以后，手工业者和群众都感到不方便。
    所以产生这种现象，是由于某些负责领导手工业改造的同志机械地认为：既然“合作化”了，生产和经营就要统一集中起来。他们不了解，采取什么样的生产和经营方式，决定于怎样做才有利于发展生产，有利于群众生活。忘记了这个根本目的，只凭主观地“想当然”办事，当然就只有把事情办坏。
