Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 25th. Representatives from the post offices and postal and telecommunications bureaus of 29 cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Harbin, Lanzhou, and Chengdu, signed an agreement in Tianjin today to accelerate the delivery speed of ordinary letters and save manpower in sorting and dispatching. The agreement stipulates that, in accordance with the existing letter volume and technical equipment conditions, direct delivery relationships should be established between post offices in major cities across the country within this year, eliminating the need for intermediate post offices to forward mail, and directly dispatching letters to the destination bureau. The agreement also stipulates that letters destined for areas where direct delivery relationships have not yet been established should be sent directly to the transit bureau closest to the destination bureau, in order to effectively shorten the delivery time of letters.

This agreement was signed by the postal representatives after learning from the experience of the Tianjin Post Office's Letter Sorting Section's work experience in ordinary letter distribution at the "National Promotion Conference of the Tianjin Post Office's Letter Sorting Section's Work Experience in Ordinary Letter Distribution." This conference was convened by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the National Committee of the Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union of China.

    二十九个城市的邮电局签订协议书
    努力缩短信件的传递时间
    据新华社天津25日电　北京、天津、上海、广州、哈尔滨、兰州、成都等29个城市的邮局和邮电局的代表，今天在天津签订了一项加速平常函件传递速度和节省分拣封发人力的协议书。协议书规定，按照现有信件流量和技术设备等条件，要在今年以内对全国各地主要城市的邮局建立直发关系，免去中间邮局转发的手续，把信件直接封发给寄达局。协议书还规定对发往还没有建立直发关系地区的函件，要直发到距离寄达局最近的经转局，以便有效地缩短信件的传递时间。
    这项协议是各邮局代表在“天津市邮局函件分拣科平常函件分发工作经验全国推广会议”上，学习天津邮局经验后签订的。这次会议是邮电部和中国邮电工会全国委员会召开的。
