    Xinhua News Agency, March 15th, Moscow dispatch: According to a report by "Pravda" reporter Ivanov from London, a grand unveiling ceremony for the Karl Marx memorial was held at Highgate Cemetery in London on March 14th, the anniversary of Marx's death. Marx's great-grandson, the painter Frederick Longe, and lawyer Robert Longe, also came from France to London to attend the unveiling ceremony.
    After brief speeches by Arthur Horner and Professor Bernal, Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, unveiled the memorial. The curtain fell to the base of the monument, which was densely covered with wreaths and flowers, revealing a huge bronze bust of Marx. With broad shoulders, the high brow of a thinker, and the sharp gaze of a future visionary peered into the distance from beneath thick, drooping eyebrows. Engraved on the light gray pedestal made of Cornish granite was a slogan: "Workers of all countries, unite!" In the center of the pedestal was a stone epitaph engraved with the names of his wife, daughters, grandchildren, and Helene Demuth, who were buried with Marx. Below the epitaph were Marx's words: "The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change it."
    British workers have long had the desire to erect a monument on Marx's tomb. The British working people have enthusiastically raised funds everywhere to build the Marx memorial. The lower-level organizations of the Welsh miners, machine-building, electrical, and construction workers' unions responded particularly enthusiastically to this call. Many lower-level organizations of the Labor Party, as well as individuals, contributed their efforts. Groups and working people from the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, various People's Democratic countries, France, Italy, and other countries around the world have also made donations to the monument construction fund.

    马克思纪念碑揭幕典礼在伦敦海格特公墓举行
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”记者伊凡诺夫从伦敦报道，在3月14日马克思逝世纪念日，在伦敦海格特公墓隆重地举行了卡尔·马克思纪念碑揭幕典礼。马克思的外孙的儿子——画家弗列德里克·朗格和律师罗伯尔·朗格也从法国来到伦敦参加纪念碑揭幕典礼。
    在阿瑟·霍尔纳和贝尔纳教授简短地致辞以后，英国共产党中央委员会总书记哈里·波立特揭开了纪念碑的幕布。幕布落到密密摆满花圈和鲜花的碑脚上，露出了巨大的马克思半身青铜雕像。宽阔的肩膀，思想家型的高阔的前额，这位未来的预见者锐利的视线从浓密的垂眉下凝视着远方。在柯恩瓦尔花岗石砌成的浅灰色台座上雕着一句口号：“全世界无产者，联合起来！”台座中央镶嵌着刻有同马克思葬在一起的他的妻子、女儿、外孙和海伦·德穆丝名字的石板墓志铭。在墓志铭之下刻着马克思的话：“从来的哲学家只是各式各样地说明世界，但是重要的乃在于改造世界。”
    英国工人们老早就有在马克思的坟墓上树立纪念碑的愿望。英国劳动人民曾经热诚地到处为修建马克思纪念碑募集资金。威尔斯的矿工、机器制造、电力、建筑工人等工会的下层组织特别热烈地响应了这一个号召。许多工党的下层组织以及个别人士都贡献了自己的力量。苏联、中华人民共和国、各人民民主国家，法国、意大利和世界上其它国家的团体和劳动人民也曾经对纪念碑建筑基金作了捐献。
