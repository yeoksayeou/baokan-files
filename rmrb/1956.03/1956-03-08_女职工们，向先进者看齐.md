    Female Employees, Learn from the Advanced
    Yang Zhihua
    As the people of the entire country are actively engaged in socialist construction, and all workers are actively participating in the advanced producer movement, it is of particular significance for us to commemorate the "March 8th" International Women's Day today.
    Our Party and the state's emphasis on and protection of women's labor have created various favorable conditions for women. With the rapid development of national economic construction, the ranks of female workers have grown, and the avenues for women's employment have become increasingly broad. Currently, the number of female employees has increased fourfold compared to the early days of liberation in 1949. Moreover, female workers have appeared in job positions where women had never been employed in the past. Under the Wuqiaoling Mountains in the Northwest, there are female bulldozer operators like Hu Youmei; on Yangtze River ships, there are female navigators like Luo Liefang; in coal mines, there are female winch operators like Jia Qingyun; in the Gobi Desert, there is a women's petroleum surveying team; and even in the Qaidam Basin, there are female geologists like Ma Nianru, who, like their male counterparts, traverse mountains and ridges to explore treasures for the motherland. All of this was unimaginable in old China. In the past, only a small number of female workers were concentrated in light industrial sectors, but now, large numbers of women are participating in heavy industry, transportation, capital construction, and all walks of life, and advanced figures of women have emerged in every industry. In the automated seamless steel tube plant, large rolling mill, and the Second Thin Plate Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel, hundreds of female workers are skillfully operating automated machinery. The workshop led by Tang Sixiao, the female deputy director of the Second Coking Workshop of a chemical plant, exceeded its plan every month in 1955 and became the most outstanding workshop in the entire factory. In the textile industry, there is Huang Baomei, an advanced female worker and her group who have overfulfilled the state plan for more than three consecutive years. Wang Suhua, a female worker at the Shijiazhuang Knitting Factory, was already working on her 1957 tasks last year. In the machinery industry, Yu Fengxian, a female turner at the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory, completed her annual workload 5 months ahead of schedule last year. On January 14th this year, a team in the anchor chain workshop of the steel casting workshop of the Dalian Shipyard completed the production quota for the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Among the 12 female workers in this team, 11 are mothers. The female train crew on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was named the winning team of the Chongqing Railway Administration.
    The above facts show that women can happily undertake the tasks assigned to them by the state in various jobs. In our country, any kind of labor is a contribution to the cause of socialist construction, and everyone's wisdom and talent can be fully utilized in any job position. The so-called advanced individuals are those who have a good work attitude and high socialist consciousness, so they can complete and over fulfill national production tasks more, faster, better, and more economically than others. Therefore, we should humbly learn from the advanced and strive to catch up with them!
    Indeed, women will encounter more difficulties than men in becoming advanced individuals. First of all, the remaining poison of feudal ideas that belittle women, brought about by history, has not been completely eradicated. For example, a leader of a certain mine in Guangdong believed that female workers were troublesome because of pregnancy and childbirth, and last year, he fired all 59 female workers in the mine, including more than 10 labor models. This incident could only be given a fair trial and reasonable solution today under our Party's policy of protecting women's labor, and finally all the female workers were reinstated. However, this kind of discriminatory thinking against women is still worthy of our attention and struggle against it. In addition, women themselves objectively have some special difficulties, such as the burden of children and housework, and a relatively low level of culture and technology.
    Can these difficulties be overcome? The answer from the examples of many advanced female workers is: they can be completely overcome.
    First, we must have a strong sense of career, a revolutionary outlook on life, and the lofty goal of striving for the cause of socialist construction. Many advanced producers have continuously created amazing achievements under the guidance of such an advanced ideology. Yang Lingying, a female worker at Shanghai State-owned Cotton Mill No. 16, has been able to comprehensively over fulfill the state plan every year, every month, and every day since the first day of our country's first Five-Year Plan, and can achieve 100% quality standards. Over the years, Yang Lingying has gone from a girl to a mother of two children, but her excellent performance in production has remained unchanged and is constantly improving. Why is Yang Lingying able to maintain such excellent results? As she herself said: "How can I not produce well? Look, who is going to make the 700 million taels of gold needed for the Five-Year Plan?" She treats her work with a sense of responsibility as a master, and she can humbly learn from other people's experience, so she can continuously improve technically. Zhang Damao, a model family member of railway workers in Beijing, also said well: "All work cannot be done well without advanced thinking." She also said: "We are not working for awards, we are working for the motherland and the cause of socialist construction."
    Secondly, we must have the combativeness to overcome various difficulties and be able to withstand various tests. Liu Guifen, a female worker in the laboratory of the Fushun Steel Plant, painstakingly studied technology and created an advanced operation method of "rapid silicon determination," which improved work efficiency by 70% and ensured the completion of steelmaking tasks. In the process of experimentation, she encountered many difficulties: the conservative thinking of technical personnel, the distrust and ridicule of some masses, and the lack of support from administrative leaders. When her first public experiment was unsuccessful, the administration announced the cessation of her experiment. But she was not discouraged and mustered the courage to request the leaders to allow her to continue the experiment. She received the support of the Party branch, and after 273 experiments, all reached the quality standards. Finally, the factory recognized her operation method and it was approved by the Central Bureau of Iron and Steel.
    Thirdly, to be an advanced individual, one must learn skills well. Therefore, improving culture and improving technology are very important. In recent years, the vast majority of female workers have actively participated in cultural learning. In 1955, the number of female employees in the country accounted for 14% of the total number of employees, while the number of female workers participating in cultural learning accounted for 16.5% of the total number of learners. A large number of female workers in various places have participated in formal and informal learning. However, it is not without difficulties for female workers to participate in cultural and technical learning. Female workers themselves must have the perseverance to overcome difficulties. Li Fengqin, a model female worker in Dalian, has insisted on participating in cultural learning for 7 years, and has never been absent, late, or left early without reason. Zhang Guiqin, a female worker at the Shenyang Rubber Factory No. 7, is the mother of 8 children, but she can also insist on learning and has excellent academic performance. In order to help solve the difficulties of female workers in learning, trade unions should find ways to do a good job in the work of nurseries and nursery stations, organize various localities to summarize and promote advanced experiences in learning culture and technology, and at the same time encourage the family members of cultural workers and technicians to participate in literacy work.
    Today, under the leadership of our working class party - the Communist Party of China, women have obtained equal rights with men. Women's labor has been respected and cared for, and the state has taken a series of measures to solve the special difficulties of female workers in participating in labor. With such good conditions, what difficulties can we not overcome?
    Female employees, comrades! The advanced producer movement is a regular movement. We must continue to work hard to complete the individual workload stipulated by the national plan ahead of schedule and over fulfill the indicators of the first Five-Year Plan; strive to achieve good product quality, low cost, and fewer rejects, and save raw materials and reduce cargo losses for the country; strive to improve and master technology, improve operation methods, and lead the masses.
    Family members of employees, comrades! You must actively encourage and help employees complete and over fulfill production tasks; lead the masses to learn advanced experiences in educating children, protecting public property, uniting and helping each other, doing a good job in hygiene, eliminating the four pests, protecting the safety of factories and mines, greening the motherland, and participating in literacy, and strive to be an advanced family member.
    All female employees, comrades, for our great motherland and socialist cause, we must strive to learn from the advanced!

    女职工们，向先进者看齐
    杨之华
    正当全国人民积极从事社会主义建设，全体职工积极参加先进生产者运动的今天，我们来纪念“三八”国际妇女节，有着特别重要的意义。
    我们党和国家对妇女劳动的重视和保护，为妇女们创造了各种有利的条件。随着国家经济建设的迅速发展，女工的队伍壮大了，妇女就业的道路日益宽阔。目前女职工人数较1949年解放初期增加了四倍。而且在过去历史上从来没有妇女担任过的工作岗位上，都出现了女工。在西北乌鞘岭下有了女推土机手胡友梅等，长江轮船上出现了女航海员罗烈芳等，煤矿有了女绞车司机贾清云等，戈壁滩上有了一支女子石油测量队，甚至在柴达木盆地也有了女地质工作者马念如等，她们和男人们一样的翻山越岭，为祖国探寻着宝藏。这一切在旧中国是不可想像的。过去只有少数的女工集中在轻工业部门，如今在重工业、交通运输业、基本建设以及各行各业中都有了大批妇女参加工作，而且行行业业中都有妇女的先进人物。在鞍山自动化无缝钢管厂以及大型轧钢厂、第二薄板厂里的数百名女工，她们熟练地操纵着自动化机器。化工厂第二炼焦车间的女副主任唐嗣孝所领导的车间，在1955年月月超额完成计划，成为全厂最优秀的车间。纺织业中有了连续3年多月月超额完成国家计划的先进女工黄宝妹和她的小组，石家庄针织厂的女工王素华，去年已经在做1957年的活了。机械工业中，沈阳风动工具厂的女车工俞凤仙，去年提前5个月完成了全年的工作量。今年1月14日，大连造船公司铸钢车间锚链工段的一个小组，提前完成了第一个五年计划的生产定额。这个小组的12个女工中，有11个是孩子的妈妈。成渝铁路上的女列车班，被评为重庆铁路管理局的优胜小组。
    以上事实，说明了妇女在各种工作中，都能愉快地担负起国家所交给她们的任务。在我们国家里，任何一种劳动都是对社会主义建设事业的一种贡献，不论在什么工作岗位上，都可以充分发挥每个人的智慧和才能。所谓先进者，也就是劳动态度好、社会主义觉悟高，所以能够比别人更多、更快、更好、更省地完成和超额完成国家生产任务。因此，应当虚心地向先进者学习，努力赶上先进！
    诚然，妇女要当先进者会比男人遇到更多的困难。首先是由于历史所带给人们的轻视妇女的封建思想余毒，还没有完全根除。例如广东某矿某领导者，认为女工怀孕、生育麻烦多，去年把矿里59名女工全部解雇，而这些女工当中就有10多名劳动模范。这一事件，只有今天在我们党保护妇女劳动的政策下，才能得到公正的裁判和合理的解决，最后全部女工恢复了工作。但是人们的这种歧视妇女的思想意识，还是值得我们注意和向它进行斗争的。另外，妇女本身客观上也有一些特殊困难，如孩子、家务的牵累，文化、技术水平较低。
    这些困难是不是可以克服的呢？从许多先进女工的事例中得到的答复是：完全可以克服。
    第一、要有坚强的事业心，革命的人生观，为社会主义建设事业而奋斗的远大目标。许多先进生产者就是在这样一种先进思想的支配下，不断地创造出惊人的事迹。上海国棉16厂的女工杨玲英，她从我国第一个五年计划开始的第一天起，每年、每月、每天都能全面地超额完成国家计划，并能百分之百地达到质量标准。几年来，杨玲英由一个姑娘变成两个孩子的妈妈，但她在生产上的优异成绩却始终不变，而且还在不断提高。杨玲英为什么能够保持这样优良的成绩呢？正如她自己说的：“那能不好好地生产，你看，五年计划所需要的7万万两黄金靠啥人？”她以主人翁的责任感对待自己的工作，她能虚心地学习别人的经验，在技术上也就能不断提高。北京铁路职工家属模范张大娘也说得好：“一切工作，没有先进思想就做不好。”她还说：“我们并不是为得奖而工作，我们是为了祖国和社会主义建设事业而工作。”
    其次，要有克服各种困难的战斗性，要经得起各种考验。抚顺制钢厂化验室女工刘桂芬，刻苦钻研技术，创造了“快速定矽”的先进操作法，提高工作效率70％，保证了炼钢任务的完成。她在试验过程中，曾经遇到过很多困难：技术人员的保守思想、某些群众的不信任和讥讽、行政领导上不支持。当她第一次公开试验没有成功，行政方面曾宣布停止她的试验。但是她并不灰心，鼓起勇气请求领导允许继续试验。她得到了党支部的支持，经过273次的试验，都达到了质量标准。最后厂里承认了她的操作法，并且得到了中央钢铁局的批准。
    第三，要做一个先进者，必须学好本领。因此，提高文化、提高技术是十分重要的。几年来，绝大多数的女工积极参加了文化学习。1955年全国女职工人数占职工总人数的14％，而女工参加文化学习的人数则占学习总人数的16.5％。各地都有大批女工参加了正规的和业余的学习。但是女工参加文化和技术学习，不是没有困难的。女工们自己要有克服困难的毅力。大连市的模范女工李凤琴，她参加文化学习坚持了7年，一次也没有无故旷课、迟到和早退。沈阳橡胶7厂女工张桂琴是8个孩子的妈妈，她也能坚持学习，而且学习成绩很好。为了协助解决女工在学习中的困难，工会应当设法把托儿所、托儿站的工作作好，组织各地方总结和推广学习文化和技术的先进经验，同时鼓励有文化的工人和技术人员的家属参加扫盲的工作。
    今天，在我们工人阶级政党——中国共产党的领导之下，妇女得到了和男子平等的权利。妇女的劳动受到了尊重和关怀，国家采取了一系列措施，来解决女工在参加劳动中的特殊困难。有了这样良好的条件，我们还有什么困难不可以克服呢？
    女职工同志们！先进生产者运动是一个经常性的运动，我们要不断努力，争取提前完成国家计划规定的个人工作量和超额完成第一个五年计划的指标；努力做到产品质量好，成本低，少出废品，为国家节约原料，减少货物损耗；努力提高和掌握技术，改进操作方法，带动群众。
    职工家属同志们！你们要积极鼓励和帮助职工完成和超额完成生产任务；在教育孩子、爱护公共财产、团结互助、搞好卫生、除四害、保卫厂矿安全、绿化祖国、参加扫盲等方面，带动群众学习先进经验，争取做一个先进家属。
    全体女职工同志们，为了我们伟大的祖国和社会主义事业，我们必须努力向先进者看齐！
