Consolidate the Production Enthusiasm of Workers and Masses
By our reporter Zhang Shihong

    In mid-December 1955, after the Party Central Committee's instructions on opposing right-leaning conservatism and accelerating the speed of socialist transformation and socialist construction were conveyed at the 53rd Factory, the entire factory immediately boiled over. The workers racked their brains, tapped potential, and ensured they would meet and surpass advanced production quotas. Yang Chongxian, a worker in the second workshop, guaranteed to complete the 1956 production task 97 days ahead of schedule. Many female workers in the fifth workshop, who were previously relatively backward in production due to family and children burdens, also expressed their desire to overcome difficulties and reach the level of advanced producers. Technical personnel also accelerated the research and processing of workers' rationalization proposals, and actively studied technology and business, strengthening technical management and production management. At the same time, the workers also urgently demanded political improvement, and about 30% of the factory's workers, technical personnel, and staff requested to join the Party or the League.

    Faced with such a situation, what was the task of the factory's Party organization? The Party Committee of the 53rd Factory discussed this issue and concluded that it was necessary to cherish this socialist enthusiasm of the workers and masses and quickly guide it to improve production and work, thereby creating a high tide of industrial production. To achieve this, the key lies in improving leadership style and methods, fully mobilizing the workers and masses, and allowing the workers and masses to boldly expose right-leaning conservative ideas in leadership. Therefore, the Party Committee decided that leading cadres at all levels must go deep into workshops and teams, personally listen to the criticisms and opinions of the workers and masses, and study and solve key problems in production and work together with the workers and masses. At the same time, the Party Committee also pointed out to the workers and masses that when making criticisms and suggestions to the leadership, they should focus on the following issues: whether various quotas, plans, and indicators are conservative, how should potential be tapped, how well is equipment utilization being utilized, what are the opinions on promoting advanced experience and handling rationalization proposals, what problems exist in enterprise management, the work of the Party organization, and the workers' living welfare, and how should they be solved. This decision and instruction of the Party Committee was supported by all the workers. In just three days, the factory's workers submitted more than 1,800 opinions and rationalization proposals to the leadership, most of which were related to improving production technical management and improving leadership style.

    While mobilizing the workers and masses to expose from the bottom up, the administrative leadership organized four professional teams, and the Party Committee held 13 professional symposiums to separately examine the work of the administrative leadership and the Party organization. After such bottom-up exposure and top-down inspection, the leading cadres of the 53rd Factory discovered that although the factory's production had greatly improved in recent years, the factory still had great potential, and the right-leaning conservative thinking of the leading cadres was still very serious. This was mainly manifested in the underestimation of the technical achievements and advanced experience of breaking through new quotas, which were not fully utilized and applied, and production plans were still drawn up according to the existing backward production level for a long time, so there were still more than 20 backward processes in the factory. In particular, due to the backward management of production technology, the leaders' handling of rationalization proposals and commendation and reward of advanced producers were not timely, which greatly limited the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers and masses. For example, the leadership had long called for promoting the experience of multi-machine tending, and some workers had increased from tending one machine to tending two or three, but the leadership had not summarized this experience and still adopted the process of one person tending one machine. The workers of the second shift of the third workshop once proposed to the foreman an advanced method of each person tending four machines, and the foreman ridiculed them, saying: "You produce defective products even when you watch one, and you want to watch four?" Now he has seriously studied the workers' opinions and believes that as long as the machine equipment is improved, one person can watch six. The workers not only exposed the shortcomings and errors in the leadership's work, but also put forward methods to improve enterprise production. For example, some proposed that the speed of machines manufacturing new products can be increased to improve equipment utilization; some proposed to appropriately reduce auxiliary workers and increase production workers; some proposed to conscientiously implement process regulations to ensure product quality and reduce tool consumption. All of these show that as long as the leading cadres overcome conservative thinking and rely on the workers to tap potential, the production and work of the 53rd Factory will definitely be further improved and improved, and the annual plan for 1956 and the first five-year plan may be completed and overfulfilled ahead of schedule.

    After checking and analyzing the above situation, the Party Committee immediately cooperated with the administrative leadership to mobilize the masses to formulate production plans. According to the usual practice of previous years, the production plan was drafted and compiled by the factory headquarters, reported to the ministry and bureau for approval, and then distributed to workshops, sections, and teams layer by layer to mobilize the workers and masses to discuss. The disadvantage of this approach is that it not only prolongs the time, generally taking two or three months to complete the discussion of the annual plan; but also limits the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. Because the indicators issued are approved by the state and distributed by the factory, although workers are called upon to tap potential and find shortcuts, they still cannot jump out of the circle already drawn by the leadership. The leadership of the 53rd Factory boldly broke this convention and adopted the method of mobilizing the masses from the bottom up, planning layer by layer, and balancing level by level. At that time, the state planning indicators had not yet been issued, but they did not wait passively, but based on the draft of the state plan for 1956, after preliminary accounting, determined an indicator to complete this year's production plan 82 days ahead of schedule and complete the five-year plan one year ahead of schedule, and immediately issued it to the workshops so that the workshop cadres had a clear idea. At the same time, they also conducted key experiments on formulating plans in a worker team, a management department, and a technical section, and immediately mobilized the workers to discuss in groups after gaining experience. During the discussion, the workers in each group, combined with summarizing the production in 1955 and the problems that have been exposed, further tapped potential and formulated personal production, technical, and political plans. After the personal plans were formulated, they were discussed and balanced layer by layer from the group, section, workshop to the factory headquarters, and finally the factory's production plan and annual plan were formulated. As a result, it only took 10 days to complete the discussion and formulation of the plan. At the same time, because the plan was drawn up on the basis of in-depth mobilization of the masses, serious tapping of potential, and adoption of reliable technical and organizational measures, the plan is advanced and practical. The indicators of each worker's personal plan have broken through the indicator of completing the 1956 production plan 82 days ahead of schedule proposed by the factory headquarters, with some people ahead of schedule by more than 100 days and some by more than 200 days. The plans of each workshop have also broken through the initial indicators of the factory headquarters, with the second and fifth workshops completing this year's production indicators 85 days ahead of schedule and the first workshop completing them 138 days ahead of schedule. As a result, the factory can complete the five-year plan one year and 46 days ahead of schedule based on cumulative output; and can complete the five-year plan one and a half years ahead of schedule based on total production value and total commodity value. Moreover, during the period of discussion and formulation of the plan, the equipment utilization rate of basic production workshops has generally improved, the advanced experience of multi-machine tending has been widely used, and the production achievements in January this year show that most workers have successfully realized their personal plans, and the factory has completed the production plan one day ahead of schedule.

    把职工群众的生产热情巩固下来
    本报记者　章世鸿
    1955年12月中旬，党中央关于反对右倾保守、加快社会主义改造和社会主义建设速度的指示在五三工厂传达以后，整个工厂立刻沸腾起来。职工们纷纷开动脑筋，挖掘潜力，保证达到和突破先进的生产定额。第二车间的工人杨崇先保证提前97天完成1956年的生产任务。第五车间的许多女工受家庭和孩子的牵累，过去在生产上比较落后，现在也表示要克服困难，使自己达到先进生产者的水平。技术人员也加快了对工人的合理化建议的研究和处理，并且积极地钻研技术和业务，加强技术管理和生产管理。同时，职工们也迫切地要求在政治上提高，全厂约有30％左右的工人、技术人员和职员要求入党、入团。
    面对着这样一个情况，工厂党组织的任务是什么呢？五三工厂的党委会讨论了这个问题，结论是必须珍视职工群众的这种社会主义积极性，并且要迅速地把它引到改进生产和工作上去，从而掀起一个工业生产的高潮。而要做到这一点，关键在于必须改进领导作风和领导方法，充分发动职工群众，让职工群众大胆地揭发领导上的右倾保守思想。因此，党委会决定，各级领导干部必须深入车间、小组，亲自听取职工群众的批评和意见，和职工群众一起研究解决生产和工作中的关键问题。同时，党委会还给职工群众指出，在向领导上提出批评和建议的时候，应该把重点放在下列问题上：各种定额、计划和指标是否保守，潜力应怎样挖掘，设备利用率发挥得怎样，对推广先进经验和处理合理化建议有什么意见，企业管理、党组织的工作和职工的生活福利上存在什么问题，应当怎样解决。党委会的这个决定和指示，得到全体职工的拥护。在短短的三天内，全厂职工向领导上提出了1，800多条意见和合理化建议，其中大部分是有关改进生产技术管理和改善领导作风的意见。
    在发动职工群众自下而上地揭发的同时，行政领导部门组织了4个专业小组，党委会召开了13个专业座谈会，分别检查了行政领导工作和党组织的工作。经过这样自下而上的揭发和自上而下的检查，五三工厂的领导干部发现：虽然这几年来工厂的生产已有了很大的提高，但是，工厂的潜力仍然很大，领导干部的右倾保守思想仍然十分严重。这主要表现在对突破新定额的技术成就和先进经验估计不足，没有充分地加以发挥和运用，长时期来仍然按照现有的落后的生产水平来编制生产计划，因而全厂还有20多个落后工序。特别是由于生产技术的管理落后，领导干部对合理化建议的处理和对先进生产者的表扬奖励不及时，因而大大地限制了职工群众的积极性和创造性。例如，领导上早就号召推广多机台看管经验，而有的工人已由一人看管一台增加到看两三台，但是领导上却没有总结这方面的经验，仍然采用一人看一台的工艺规程。三车间二工段的工人，曾经向工长提出过每人看管四台机器的先进方法，工长嘲笑他们说：“你们看一台都出废品，还要看四台？”现在他认真地研究了工人的意见，认为只要改进机器设备，一人可以看六台。工人们不但揭发了领导工作中的缺点，错误，也提出了改进企业生产的办法。如有的提出制造新产品的机器可以提高转数，提高设备利用率；有的提出适当减少辅助工人，增加生产工人；有的提出要认真贯彻执行工艺规程，以保证产品质量和降低工具的消耗。所有这些都说明，只要领导干部克服了保守思想，依靠职工挖掘潜力，五三工厂的生产和工作一定会有进一步的改进和提高，1956年的年度计划和第一个五年计划就有可能提前完成和超额完成。
    党委会在检查分析了上述的情况以后，立即协同行政领导部门发动群众制定生产规划。按照历年的惯例，生产计划都是由厂部拟定编完以后，上报部、局批准，然后经由车间、工段、小组层层下达，发动职工群众讨论。这种做法的坏处是：不但拖长了时间，一般要在二、三月里才能讨论完一年的计划；而且限制了群众的积极性创造性。因为下达的指标是经过国家批准、经过厂部分派下来的，虽然号召工人挖潜力，找窍门，结果还是跳不出领导上已经划定的圈子。五三工厂的领导上大胆地打破了这个常规，采取了自下而上发动群众，层层规划，逐级平衡的方法。当时国家计划指标还没有下达，但是他们没有消极等待，而是以1956年国家计划草案为基础，经过初步核算，确定了一个提前82天完成今年生产计划、提前一年完成五年计划的指标，立即下达到车间，使车间干部心中有数。同时他们还在一个工人小组、一个管理部门和一个技术科作了制定规划的重点试验，取得经验以后就立即发动工人，以小组为单位进行讨论。在讨论中，各小组的工人结合总结1955年的生产和已经揭发出来的问题，进一步挖掘潜力，订出了个人的生产、技术和政治规划。个人规划订出后，再由小组、工段、车间直到厂部，层层讨论，层层平衡，最后订出了全厂的生产规划和年度计划。这样做的结果，仅仅花费了10天的时间，就完成了讨论和制定规划的工作。同时由于规划是在深入发动群众、认真挖掘潜力和采取可靠的技术组织措施的基础上订出来的，因而规划是先进的，切实可行的。每个工人的个人规划的指标，都突破了厂部提出的提前82天完成1956年生产计划的指标，有的人提前100多天，有的人提前200多天。各车间的规划也都突破了厂部最初的指标，二、五车间将提前85天，一车间将提前138天，完成今年的生产指标。结果，全厂按累计产量计算，可以提前一年零46天完成五年计划；按生产总值、商品总值计算，可以提前一年半完成五年计划。而且就在讨论和制定规划的期间，基本生产车间的设备利用率普遍提高了，多机台看管的先进经验被广泛地运用起来了，今年1月份的生产成绩表明，多数工人胜利地实现了个人的规划，全厂提前一天完成了生产计划。
