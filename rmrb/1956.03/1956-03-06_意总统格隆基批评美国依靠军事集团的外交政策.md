Xinhua News Agency dispatch from TASS – Italian newspapers are paying great attention to the speeches made by Italian President Gronchi during his visit to the United States. When Gronchi delivered a speech at a joint session of the U.S. Congress on February 29th, he implicitly criticized the U.S. foreign policy of relying on military blocs, particularly the North Atlantic Treaty policy. He said that the Western world is experiencing a "stage of ideological and political disarray." He stated, "It is enough to look at the situation in North Africa and the Middle East, and to listen to the rumblings coming from the Asian region." When talking about the recent changes in the international situation, he said: "We are moving from a cold war towards a more peaceful competition... This competition is sweeping through more vast areas, and its significance is becoming greater day by day." Gronchi expressed approval of the North Atlantic Treaty, but he said that emphasizing military agreements is outdated and should be supplemented by "far-sighted new methods of cooperation," primarily economic cooperation. Gronchi demanded that the North Atlantic Treaty "adapt to the current realities of many changes taking place in many regions of the world." He pointed out that people are uneasy and burdened by a world future based on military strength or restrictive political alliances. He believes that "in addition to maintaining military strength, all efforts must be made to eliminate the threat of war and gradually eliminate the need to use force."

He advocated abandoning the dangerous path based on the balance of power and instead working to provide the world with a better foundation through cooperation in political, social, and economic aspects. Gronchi believes that if Western ideas cannot demonstrate the possibility of eliminating injustices within countries and internationally, they cannot win in the new competition of ideological systems and economic aid.

In commenting on Gronchi's speech, "l'Unità" emphasized that Gronchi's remarks are part of a growing general movement within Western countries demanding a change in foreign policy. From Gronchi's speech, it can be concluded that the North Atlantic Treaty no longer conforms to the current international situation.

The Socialist Party's newspaper "Avanti!" wrote that Gronchi's speech "reflects a strong desire for change, and if the Italian government does not support all these desires, it may encounter some unpleasant surprises." "Avanti!" pointed out that French Foreign Minister Pineau's recent speech also showed France's strong desire to find new paths. The newspaper then reminded that Gronchi will soon be paying a formal visit to France. The newspaper predicted that the issue of finding a new foreign policy will be the focus of his talks with French leaders.

    意总统格隆基批评美国依靠军事集团的外交政策
    新华社据塔斯社报道  意大利报纸很重视意大利总统格隆基在美国访问期间发表的演说。格隆基2月29日在美国国会两院联席会议上发表演说时，含蓄地批评了美国依靠军事集团的外交政策，特别是北大西洋公约政策。他说，西方世界正在经历着“在思想和政治方面惊惶失措的阶段”。他说，“只要看一看北非和中东的情况，听一听从亚洲地区传来的轰隆声就够了”。他在谈到最近国际局势的变化时说：“我们从冷战走向比较和平的竞赛……这种竞赛席卷更加辽阔的地区，它的意义一天比一天重大。”格隆基对北大西洋公约表示赞许，但是他说，强调军事协定是过时了，应当用“有远见的新的合作方法”首先是经济合作来补充。格隆基要求北大西洋公约“适应在世界许多地区发生许多变化的当前实际情况”。他指出，人们都对以军事力量或限制性的政治联盟为基础的世界前途感到不安和沉重。他认为，“除维持军事实力外，必须竭尽努力来消除战争威胁以及逐渐消除使用武力的必要性”。
    他主张放弃建立在均势基础上的危险道路，而应该努力通过政治、社会、经济各方面的合作，为世界提供一个更好的基础。格隆基认为，西方的观念如果不能表现出可能消除在各国和在国际的不公平现象，就不能在思想体系和经济援助的新竞赛中获胜。
    在评论格隆基的演说时，“团结报”强调指出，格隆基的言论是西方国家内部日益加强的要求改变外交政策的普遍运动的一部分。从格隆基演说中可以得出北大西洋公约已经不符合目前国际局势的结论。
    社会党机关报“前进报”写道，格隆基的演说“反映出了要求改变的强烈愿望，如果意大利政府不支持这一切愿望，它就可能碰上一些不愉快的意外事件”。“前进报”指出，法国外交部长比诺最近的演说也表明法国对找寻新途径的强烈愿望。报纸接着提醒说，格隆基很快就要正式访问法国。报纸预测，寻找新的外交政策的问题将是他同法国领导人进行的会谈的中心。
