    Harris's Provocation
    Harris, the Director of Operations of the U.S. Far East Air Force, arrived in Matsu from Taiwan on the 19th and publicly made bellicose remarks threatening the Chinese people. According to reports, Harris "inspected" military engineering on this island, viewed the terrain of Matsu, and spied on the coastal situation of mainland China. He also asked with great interest, "Which is the best landing spot on the opposite coastal area?" This American soldier finally claimed that if war broke out in Matsu, he believed that united air support would not be a problem.
    Harris's warmongering remarks most clearly prove that the United States is intensifying and expanding its military control over the Taiwan area and coastal islands, and encouraging the Chiang Kai-shek clique to harass mainland China.
    Three days before Harris made these provocative remarks, Dulles flew from Manila to Taiwan. In Dulles's statement, he clearly admitted that the purpose of his visit to Taiwan was to hold "another consultation" with the Chiang Kai-shek clique in accordance with the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty." According to a Taipei dispatch from the Associated Press on the 16th, the "coastal islands issue was undoubtedly discussed" during the talks between Dulles and the Chiang Kai-shek clique.
    These circumstances give people reason to believe that Harris's remarks were by no means accidental; they reflect the consistent U.S. policy in the Taiwan area: to occupy Taiwan by force, to obstruct the Chinese government from exercising sovereignty over Taiwan and the coastal islands, and to interfere in China's internal affairs. The warmongers in the U.S. ruling clique also use the Taiwan issue as a lever to aggravate tensions in the Far East. People will not forget that Dulles once openly expressed his readiness to use Korea, Indochina, and Taiwan as bases to launch military offensives against the People's Republic of China.
    This American general's provocative remarks expose the hypocritical attitude of the United States in the Sino-American ambassadorial talks. As everyone knows, the Geneva talks have been dragging on for more than six months since entering the second item on the agenda without reaching an agreement. The United States has been insisting in the talks that the Chinese and American sides should issue a statement renouncing the use of force, provided that the United States enjoys the so-called "self-defense" right. However, Harris has openly stated that the United States attempts to expand its military occupation of Taiwan and to take blatant military intervention in our country's liberation of the coastal islands. This clearly shows that the US draft statement is merely an attempt to legitimize the US occupation of Taiwan and interference in China's internal affairs under the guise of "self-defense." This is something that the Chinese people can never agree to.
    The intimidation of Harris and Dulles cannot shake the determination of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands. This is China's internal affair, and no one can interfere. Regarding the dispute between China and the United States in the Taiwan area, we have always advocated resolving it through consultation. However, the Chinese people cannot tolerate the United States deliberately delaying the talks, continuing to strengthen US military forces in the Taiwan area, and obstructing our country from exercising sovereignty over this area.

    哈里斯的挑衅
    美国远东空军作战署长哈里斯，在十九日由台湾到达马祖，并公然发表恫吓中国人民的好战言论。据报道，哈里斯在这个岛屿上“视察”了兵工工程，观看了马祖地形并窥测我国大陆的沿岸情况。他还极感兴趣地询问：“在对岸沿海地区的哪一地方是最好的登陆地点”。这个美国军人最后声称，如果马祖发生战事，他相信联合的空中支援是不会有问题的。
    哈里斯的好战言论最清楚不过地证明：美国正在加紧和扩大它对台湾地区和沿海岛屿的军事控制，并鼓励蒋介石集团对中国大陆进行骚扰。
    在哈里斯发表这一挑衅性言论之前的三天，杜勒斯由马尼拉飞到台湾。在杜勒斯的声明中，他明白地供认了自己去台湾的目的是，根据美蒋“共同防御条约”，同蒋介石集团“再度举行一次协商会议”。据美联社台北十六日的消息，杜勒斯和蒋介石集团的会谈中，“无疑谈到了沿海岛屿问题”。
    这些情况，使人们有理由相信：哈里斯的言论决不是偶然的；它反映了美国在台湾地区的一贯政策：以武力侵占台湾，阻挠中国政府对台湾和沿海岛屿行使主权，干涉中国内政。美国统治集团中的好战分子，还利用台湾问题作为加剧远东紧张局势的杠杆。人们不会忘记，杜勒斯曾经公开表示准备把朝鲜、印度支那和台湾作为基地，发动对中华人民共和国的军事进攻。
    这个美国将军的挑衅言论，揭穿了美国在中美大使级会谈中的虚伪态度。大家知道，日内瓦会谈自进入第二项议程以来，已拖延了六个多月而未能达成协议。美国在会谈中一直坚持，要求在美国享有所谓“自卫”权利的条件下，由中美双方发表放弃使用武力的声明。但是，哈里斯却已公开表示，美国企图扩大对台湾的军事占领，对我国解放沿海岛屿采取露骨的军事干涉。这就十分清楚地说明，美国的声明草案，只是企图假借“自卫”之名，造成美国侵占台湾和干涉中国内政的合法化。这是中国人民所决不能同意的。
    哈里斯和杜勒斯之流的恫吓，决不能动摇中国人民解放台湾和沿海岛屿的决心。这是中国的内政，任何人不能干涉。关于中国和美国在台湾地区的争端，我们一直主张用协商方法来加以解决。但是中国人民不能容忍美国在会谈中故意拖延时日，继续加强美国在台湾地区的军事力量，以阻挠我国对这一地区行使主权。
