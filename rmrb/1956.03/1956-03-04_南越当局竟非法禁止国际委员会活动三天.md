　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 3rd: Vietnam News Agency reported on March 3rd from South Vietnam that the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities have forbidden all personnel of the International Commission in Saigon and the International Supervisory Groups in South Vietnam from going out for three days starting from March 3rd.

　　This is obviously obstructing the work of the International Commission in order to facilitate the Ngo Dinh Diem group's brutal suppression of the people in the one-sided election farce held on March 4th. This behavior is a complete violation of the letter and spirit of the Geneva Accords.

    南越当局竟非法禁止国际委员会活动三天
    新华社河内3日电　越南通讯社3日讯：据南越来的消息说，吴庭艳当局从3月3日起禁止在西贡的国际委员会全体人员和在南越的国际视察小组外出3天。
    这显然是在阻挠国际委员会的工作，以便于吴庭艳集团能够在3月4日举行的片面选举丑剧中残酷地镇压人民。这种行为是完全违反日内瓦协议的文字和精神的。
