	From Extravagance and Waste to Running the Cooperative Thriftily
	Zheng Song

	The Shahe, Gangou, Lengshuigou, and Jianguo Agricultural Production Cooperatives in Licheng County, Shandong Province, were relatively well-run advanced cooperatives in the trial stage last December. The members had few concerns, their production enthusiasm was high, and they achieved remarkable results in winter agricultural and sideline production. However, at the same time, serious extravagance and waste emerged, mainly manifested in: (1) Undertaking capital construction and non-productive facilities too early and excessively, without considering actual needs and possible conditions, greatly dispersing and wasting production funds. For example, the Dongfanghong Cooperative in Lengshuigou Township had just been established, and production funds were insufficient, but the cooperative cadres planned to buy two large trucks, ten rubber-wheeled carts, a film projector, two telephones, a radio, three receivers, and many cultural and recreational items and office supplies, all worth about 55,000 yuan, equivalent to the annual grain output income of over 1,900 mu of land (accounting for 25% of the cooperative's total cultivated land). The expenses for already purchased screens, tables, basketballs, volleyballs, ping-pong balls, erhu, mimeograph machines, wood for housing, nursery supplies, and office expenses, film expenses, cigarettes, alcohol, candy, and entertainment gifts amounted to 1,806 yuan. If this money were used for production, it could buy twenty waterwheels. Because the cash was used for these non-productive expenditures, this cooperative of nearly 600 households now has only about 100 yuan in cash left, not even enough to buy barley seeds. (2) Pursuing quantity and quality, favoring the new and disliking the old, disregarding costs, and blindly spending. For example, the Gangou Township Cooperative needed a total of 160 sets of rope loops, but it planned to buy all new ones, ignoring the eighty sets it already possessed. Only 160 livestock muzzle reins were needed, but it planned to buy 720. It needed 3,000 jin of cotton seeds, but it planned to buy from other cooperatives, neglecting the 2,000 jin of improved seeds already available among its members. Thus, adding the planned expenses for building thirteen auditorium rooms, forty-eight cattle pens, and seventy-square-meter pigsties, the entire cooperative would need to spend more than 25,000 yuan. (3) Financial expenditures lacked planning and systems, buying whatever was wanted, taking whatever was needed, spending money arbitrarily, and taking things casually. For example, the Jianguo Cooperative in Erxian Township, with 763 households, issued 250 sheets of white paper and 27.12 jin of kerosene in a single day. The custodian was so busy every day just issuing fodder, kerosene, paper, ink, and other daily necessities to each team. From January 28th to February 18th, in just over twenty days, without buying any production tools, it spent more than 3,000 yuan, and in the end, it did not even have enough money to buy wheat seeds. The Gangou Township Cooperative had forty-two lights every night, and sixty-seven jin of kerosene per month would have been enough. Due to the lack of a system, eighty-four lights were lit, consuming as much as 135 jin of kerosene per month.

	The aforementioned serious extravagance and waste will inevitably lead to serious consequences of either large increases in production with equally large expenditures, or small increases in production with large expenditures, making it impossible for the actual income of the members to increase, or even causing it to decrease. Therefore, it aroused concerns and dissatisfaction among the members. Members of the Dongfanghong Cooperative in Lengshuigou Township reflected: Before the advanced cooperative had even increased production, so much money had already been spent; we don't know if the harvested grain will be enough to cover expenses. Members of the Gangou Township Cooperative reflected: The advanced cooperative is good, but how can we increase income if we spend money like this without limits?

	The main reasons for the above-mentioned extravagance and waste are: (1) Cooperative cadres and cooperative leaders lack sufficient understanding of the principle of running the cooperative thriftily, and they do not understand that the responsibility entrusted to them by the members is to lead them to increase production and income. They blindly believed that once an advanced cooperative was established, everything should be "good, generous, and showy," thinking that not doing so would fail to demonstrate "superiority." For example, cadres of the Dongfanghong Cooperative in Lengshuigou Township said: Planning to increase production by so much grain, spending 18,000 yuan is nothing… Now that we have an advanced cooperative, should we still be stingy like before? (2) The cooperative cadres were clueless, and did not understand how much investment was needed for production in the cooperative and how much investment was available. The entire financial expenditure of the cooperative lacked planning. As a result, things that should not have been bought were bought, and things that should have been used sparingly were used excessively. (3) Cooperative cadres lacked sufficient understanding of the importance of financial management and lacked leadership over financial work. In some cooperatives, all work was handed over to the accountant and custodian, and the lack of a financial management system created opportunities for extravagance and waste. (4) There was a mentality of simply relying on state loans and support, believing that the government should provide whatever the advanced cooperative lacked, and that if there was no money, they could ask the government. Cadres of the Gangou Township Cooperative openly told the members: "What's the big deal about spending a little money? Don't be afraid, the government will lend us the money, and we'll repay it whenever we have it."

	After discovering the aforementioned extravagance and waste, the county and district committees immediately inspected the financial expenditures of each cooperative, educated the cooperative cadres and cooperative leaders on running the cooperative thriftily, and helped them calculate several major financial expenditure accounts, using facts to illustrate the harm of extravagance and waste. For example, the Gangou Township specifically calculated the expenses for building offices, livestock sheds, and items such as lamp oil and livestock shed equipment, totaling 46,000 jin of grain, at an enlarged meeting of the cooperative affairs committee. This shocked the cooperative cadres, who all said: This is terrible! If we continue like this, even if we increase production, it won't be enough to cover expenses; how can we guarantee an increase in members' income! They unanimously demanded that the plan be revised and expenses reduced.

	After raising the awareness of cooperative cadres and members about running the cooperative thriftily, each cooperative revised its expenditure plan according to its own needs and possible conditions, adhering to the principles of practicing strict economy, opposing extravagance and waste, and first concentrating funds on expanding production. The main revisions included the following four aspects: First, reducing or stopping non-productive expenditures and capital construction costs that were not currently needed, such as buying cars, building auditoriums and offices, buying sewing machines, film projectors, screens, clothing, etc., and concentrating funds on purchasing waterwheels, double-furrow plows, farm tools, pigs, sheep, and pesticides; second, making full use of existing farm tools and improved seeds, accumulating more coarse manure, using coarse fertilizer instead of fine fertilizer, reducing cash expenditures, and lowering cost expenses; third, implementing a fixed-quota system for administrative expenses to eliminate waste in administrative management fees; fourth, seeking new sources of funds according to production needs to overcome cash difficulties. After the plan was revised in this way, expenditures were greatly reduced, fundamentally eliminating extravagance and waste, and greatly reducing cash expenditures. Some cooperatives have even gone from deficit to surplus.

	In order to effectively ensure the realization of the financial plan, each cooperative, on the basis of passing the plan, formulated a financial expenditure system, clearly stipulating what should not be spent, what should be spent, how much should be spent, and who should approve each expenditure. This plugged the loopholes for extravagance and waste, and greatly increased the enthusiasm of the members to inspect and supervise the financial plan. After the Gangou Township Cooperative stipulated the system, the members happily said: If the cadres save money, we will work hard and produce more grain to guarantee an increase in income.

    从铺张浪费到勤俭办社
    郑松
    山东省历城县沙河、港沟、冷水沟、建国等四个农业生产合作社是去年十二月份试办较好的高级社。社员顾虑少，生产情绪高，冬季农副业生产取得了显著成绩。但是，与此同时，产生了严重的铺张浪费现象，主要表现在：（1）不根据实际需要和可能条件，过早过多地进行基本建设和非生产的设施，大大分散和浪费了生产资金。如冷水沟乡东方红合作社刚刚建成，生产资金不足，社干部就打算年内买大卡车两辆，胶轮大车十辆，电影放映机一部，电话机二部，收音机一架，收音器三个以及许多文化娱乐用品、办公用品等，共约值五万五千元左右，相当于一千九百多亩地（占本社耕地总数的25％）的全年粮食产量收入。已经买的幕布、桌子、篮排球、乒乓球、胡琴、油印机、房屋木料、托儿所用具和开支办公费、电影费、烟酒、糖果以及招待送礼等费用，就用了一千八百零六元。这笔钱如果用于生产，可买二十部水车。由于现金都用于这些非生产性的开支，这个近六百户的合作社，现在只剩下一百元左右的现金，连买大麦种的钱都没有了。（2）贪多贪好，喜新厌旧，不计成本，盲目开支。如港沟乡合作社，共需一百六十套绳套，社里有八十套不用，计划全部买新的。牲口笼嘴缰绳只需买一百六十个就够了，却计划买七百二十个。共需棉花种三千斤，社员已经有二千斤良种不去收集，却计划去买别的社的。这样，再加上计划盖礼堂十三间、牛栅四十八间、猪舍七十方的费用，全社即需要开支二万五千多元。（3）财政支出无计划无制度，要什么买什么，用什么领什么，随便花钱，随便领物。如二仙乡七百六十三户的建国合作社，一天当中就发出白纸二百五十张，煤油二十七斤十二两。保管员每天光发各队的饲料和煤油、纸墨等日用品就忙的不得了。从一月二十八日至二月十八日二十多天中，没有买什么生产工具，就花了三千多元，最后连买麦种的钱都没有了。港沟乡合作社每晚有四十二个灯，每月用六十七斤煤油就足够了。由于没有制度，就点了八十四个灯，每月用煤油达一百三十五斤之多。
    上述严重的铺张浪费现象，必然会造成增产大，开支也大，或增产少开支大的严重后果，使社员的实际收入不能增加甚至减少。因之，引起了社员的顾虑和不满。冷水沟乡东方红合作社的社员反映：办起高级社来还没有增产，就花了这么些钱，打下粮食来，还不知够不够开支的。港沟乡合作社社员反映：高级社好是好，但是这样花钱没有个数怎么能增加收入呢？
    产生上述铺张浪费现象的原因，主要是：（1）办社干部和社的领导人员对勤俭办社的方针认识不足，不了解社员委托给自己的责任是领导他们增加生产，增加收入，而盲目地认为办了高级社，就应该“样样好，讲大方，闹排场”，以为不这样就不能显示“优越性”。如冷水沟东方红合作社的干部说：计划增产这么多粮食，花个一万八千算不了什么……办高级社了，还像过去那样小手小脚的吗？（2）社干部心中无数，对于社内生产需要多少投资和有多少投资不了解。社里整个财政开支都没有计划。结果，不该买的买了，该少用的用多了。（3）社干部对财务管理的重要性认识不足，缺乏对财务工作的领导。有的社一切工作都交给会计、保管去管，加上财务管理无制度，便给铺张浪费造成了空隙。（4）有单纯依靠国家贷款扶持的思想，认为高级社缺什么政府就应该给什么，没有钱可以找政府。港沟乡合作社的干部公开对社员说：“花几个钱算什么，不要怕，钱有政府贷给咱，什么时候有什么时候还。”
    县委、区委发现了上述铺张浪费现象，立即对各社的财政支出作了检查，对办社干部和社的领导人员进行了勤俭办社的教育，并且帮助他们算了几笔主要的财政支出账，用事实说明了铺张浪费的危害性。如港沟乡在扩大社务委员会上具体算了盖办公室、牲口栅及灯油、牲口栅用具等三笔开支账，即需粮食四万六千斤。这使社干部大吃一惊，都说：这还了得！照这样办下去，就是增加生产也不够花的，怎么能保证社员增加收入！一致要求修订计划，减少开支。
    在提高了社干部和社员对勤俭办社的认识以后，各社都根据本社的需要和可能条件，按照厉行节约，反对铺张浪费，首先集中资金用于扩大生产的原则，修订了开支计划。修订的内容主要的有如下四方面：一是减少或停止非生产性开支和目前还不需要的基本建设费用，如买汽车、盖礼堂、办公室、买缝纫机、电影放映机、幕布、服装等，集中资金用于购买水车、双铧犁、农具、猪羊及农药等；二是充分利用已经有的农具和良种，多积粗粪，以粗肥代细肥，减少现金开支，降低成本费用；三是实行行政经费包干制度，消除行政管理费的浪费现象；四是根据生产需要，寻找新的资金来源，克服现金困难。计划经过这样修订以后，支出大大减少，从根本上消除了铺张浪费现象，使现金开支大大缩小，有的社已经由亏到余。
    为了切实保证财务计划的实现，各社在通过计划的基础上，都订出了财务开支制度，明确规定了哪些不应开支，哪些应开支，开支多少，什么开支经谁批准。这样便堵塞了铺张浪费的漏洞，并且大大提高了社员群众检查和监督财务计划的积极性。港沟乡合作社规定了制度之后，社员们高兴地说：干部节省花钱，咱就使劲干，多打粮食保证增加收入。
