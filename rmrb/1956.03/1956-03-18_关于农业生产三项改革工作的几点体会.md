Some Experiences on the Three Reforms of Agricultural Production

Zeng Xisheng, Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

It has been three years since Anhui Province implemented the three reforms of agricultural production (referred to as "three reforms"). Generally speaking, the progress has been good. First, the promotion speed is very fast. In 1953, the first year the "three reforms" were proposed, only 199.5 mu were produced according to the requirements of the "three reforms," accounting for a very small percentage of the province's grain-producing land. In 1954, it reached 5,392,036 mu, 27,000 times that of 1953, accounting for 7.6% of the province's grain-producing land. In 1955, it reached 23,039,518 mu, 4.3 times that of 1954, accounting for 32.45% of the province's grain-producing land. This year, it is estimated that it can reach about 40 million mu, an increase of about 17 million mu compared with last year, accounting for more than 56% of the province's grain-producing land. Second, the increase in production is not small. Although Anhui suffered a major flood in 1954, the implementation of the "three reforms" still increased grain production by more than 670 million jin, reducing the losses from the flood. In 1955, the province's total grain production increased by 4.7 billion jin, of which 2.7 billion jin was due to the implementation of the "three reforms," meaning that the land produced according to the "three reforms" method increased by an average of 117 jin per mu. Third, cadres and the masses have responded very well. Many cadres said: In the past, leading production was vague, but since the implementation of the "three reforms," there has been a clear path. Farmers praised the "three reforms," saying: "The 'three reforms' are good, the 'three reforms' are good, they are the magic weapon for good crops, they can avoid disasters and resist floods. Since the implementation of the 'three reforms,' we have harvested more grain and more grass." Some praised "dry land changed to paddy fields," saying: "Dry land changed to paddy fields, one year is equivalent to three years." Some praised planting early rice, saying: "Planting early rice is good everywhere, no drought, no flood, the rice insects are not born yet, the rice is harvested early." Some praised planting double-cropping rice, saying: "Double-cropping rice, be bold and do it, two crops can harvest high yields, even if there is a disaster, the east is not bright, the west is bright." (Meaning that one season can always be harvested.) Some praised planting potatoes, saying: "Potatoes, high yield, short maturity period, not afraid of floods, can be used as grain, can be used as vegetables, the market price is good." In short, due to the implementation of the "three reforms" avoiding disasters and increasing production, the broad masses are very satisfied. Popularizing it throughout the province is no longer a difficult problem. This year is the fourth year of implementing the "three reforms." We originally did not intend to introduce anything more, but due to the encouragement and expectations of many comrades, we have no choice but to write down a few experiences on the proposal and promotion of the "three reforms."

Although the content of the "three reforms" is very ordinary, its proposal and promotion have gone through arduous struggles. In these arduous struggles, we have the following experiences:

	We must study deeply to find out where the problems lie

Before the "three reforms" were proposed in 1953, the production situation in Anhui was as follows: On the one hand, continuous and severe floods occurred throughout the province, especially in Huaibei (four floods in five years, of which 1952 was the smallest flood, but it also flooded 12.8 million mu of land, affecting 3.48 million people), causing anxiety among the broad masses and cadres. On the other hand, in areas not affected by the disaster, production did increase, and the lives of farmers were greatly improved. In this situation, the following confused ideas arose: The first type was pessimism and disappointment. Some people believed that disaster relief was bottomless and production was hopeless. Although the Jiang disaster was eliminated, natural disasters could not be eliminated, and harnessing the Huai River was useless. Some cadres requested to be transferred away from the disaster areas, and many people planned to flee famine, and production enthusiasm could not be raised. The second type was dependence and waiting. People with this idea believed that only if the Central Government quickly repaired the Huai River and allocated more relief funds could production be hoped for and the famine could be overcome. The third type was blind paralysis. This type of people ignored the severity of the disaster, did not examine the effectiveness of harnessing the Huai River, and treated the Huai River according to the old method of "flood control without drainage." The fourth type was pride and complacency. Cadres in areas without disasters believed that production had reached its peak and potential had been exhausted, and said that the masses were all production experts and did not need our leadership. As long as the cooperatives were organized, everything would be fine. How can we overcome these erroneous ideological deviations? How can we raise the production enthusiasm of the masses? How can we ensure more harvests in the event of disasters? How can we overcome the actual difficulties we face and reduce the central government's disaster relief payments? At that time, the Provincial Party Committee believed that these problems were problems that we must solve on the road to progress, and whether our leadership work could play its due role. Therefore, a series of studies were conducted on these issues. Chairman Mao taught us: "No matter what you do, if you do not understand the situation of that matter, its nature, its relationship with things outside it, you will not know the law of that matter, you will not know how to do it, and you will not be able to do that matter well." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, pp. 163-164) We conducted our research based on this principle.

We studied many issues, the most important of which were the following:

One, how serious is the disaster situation in Anhui (especially Huaibei)? For this question, we collected a lot of historical data, proving that a disaster of varying degrees occurs every two or three years. According to the records of the "Huai River Chronology," more than 980 major and minor disasters occurred in the Huaibei area in two thousand years, an average of once every two years, with about half floods and half droughts. This made us understand the regularity and severity of Huai River disasters.

Two, why are the floods in Anhui so serious? When do they generally occur each year? For this question, we conducted research from three aspects.

First, from the meteorological aspect, we understood: Due to wind direction, the hot air mass of the Indian Ocean often starts to meet the cold air mass in the north in June and July in Jiangnan or Huaibei to form torrential rains. If these two air masses hold still, continuous torrential rain centers will form in this area, so serious floods often occur between July, August and September. There is little rain in autumn, winter, spring and summer, and the amount of water is not enough for the needs of crops, so droughts often form. In order to verify this situation, we also conducted a survey of more than 100 years of disasters in many places in Huaibei based on the memories of the elderly and the records of county chronicles, proving that floods and droughts mostly occur at these times; and proving that there is a major flood disaster every 10 to 30 years, and a serious flood disaster about every 5 years. This made us understand the temporality of the disaster situation in the Huaibei area, which can also be said to be a general regularity.

Second, the terrain conditions and social roots were also analyzed. Anhui is located in the middle reaches of the Huai River and the upper reaches of the Hongze Lake Dam. The water discharged downstream is restricted, so every time the flood season comes, the water from above is not small, and the discharge from below is not large. For example, during the flood season in 1954, the water from the upper reaches was 17.5 billion cubic meters, and the water in the middle reaches itself was 28.5 billion cubic meters, totaling 46 billion cubic meters, but only 15.3 billion cubic meters flowed out of Sanhe Dam, and another 30.7 billion cubic meters stagnated above Hongze Lake. The lake contained 23.7 billion cubic meters, and 22.3 billion cubic meters stagnated above Bengbu. From here, we can know the severity of the flood situation in Anhui. On the Yangtze River side, Anhui is located above the East and West Liang Mountains, and the situation is the same as that of the Huai River. The characteristics of the Huai River are: on the one hand, it faces a vast plain, the riverbed is small, the gradient is small, the flow rate is slow, there is a lot of sedimentation, it is easy to be silted up, and floods are easy to occur; on the other hand, it is close to the mountains, and the water comes down steeply and quickly, which easily forms flood disasters. In addition, the Huai River has been invaded by the Yellow River many times, especially after the garden mouth was opened, the large and small rivers became more silted up and elevated, and the flood discharge system was completely destroyed. Therefore, whenever a rainstorm comes, the water in the dry river is higher than the water in the tributary, and the water in the tributary is higher than the flat ground, and major and minor floods occur every year.

Third, we studied the reasons why this area is prone to flooding from the perspective of farming conditions. The rainfall in the Huai River basin is concentrated in July, August and September, but it is still less than the rainfall south of the Yangtze River; the reason why it is prone to disasters is that sesame and mung beans are not resistant to water, and if the rainfall is slightly heavy, they will be flooded or drowned. But if rice is planted, 300 to 400 millimeters of rain is not only harmless, but also beneficial. However, why do the people of Huaibei plant dry crops according to the northern habit instead of planting rice according to the Jiangnan habit? The main reason is that there is a lack of rain when sowing in May and June, and seedlings cannot be transplanted. At the same time, it does not rain heavily every year in July, August and September, so the masses do not have the ability or confidence to plant rice.

Three, we compared the water and drought resistance of various crops and the early or late sowing period and the length of the maturity period; and investigated the length of the frost-free period north and south of the Yangtze River and north and south of the Huai River in Anhui.

After we did these basic work, we further considered how to overcome disasters, how to avoid disasters, how to exert production potential, and how to achieve spending less money and achieving quick results.

In terms of overcoming floods and droughts, we not only did not underestimate the achievements of harnessing the Huai River, but also emphasized the role of harnessing the Huai River; but we changed the old Huai River viewpoint of only talking about "flood control and embankment protection" and not talking about "drainage and harvest protection," and changed the dependent thinking of simply waiting for the Huai River to be harnessed. Starting from the basic requirement of avoiding unfavorable conditions in production and exerting favorable conditions in production, we proposed the methods of "changing planting to avoid disasters," "changing planting to increase production," and "combining disaster prevention with production." This is what we call the "three reforms."

	What exactly is the content of the "three reforms"? The first reform is to expand the autumn and winter sowing area, increase the proportion of summer harvest, and plant a season of late autumn crops as much as possible, striving for three seasons of continuous cropping in the whole year to expand the multiple cropping index. The advantage of this method is to avoid floods and droughts from the season, and to exert the superior climatic conditions by planting a season of late autumn crops. The second reform is to change to planting high-yield crops, change to planting water-resistant and drought-resistant crops, change to using improved varieties, and change dry land to paddy fields, paddy fields to dry land, and so on. The advantage of this method is to use the characteristics of crops to resist disasters, use the superiority of varieties to increase yields, and use the method of adapting to local conditions to prevent disasters in advance. The third reform is to change the bad habit of extensive planting and low harvest, and improve farming methods. The advantage of this method is to increase yields by reforming production technology. In short, the content of the "three reforms" is the reform of "cropping system," "crop variety," and "farming method." It is an effective method to avoid floods and droughts and tap the "power of heaven," "power of earth," and "power of things" when water conservancy projects are still unable to be fully developed. This is the reason why we only propose the "three reforms."

We believe that the "three reforms" method is suitable for the situation in Anhui. The reason why it can be suitable for the situation in Anhui is that it is the result of careful investigation and research. This is our first experience.

	We must trust the masses and learn from the masses

Although we found out and proved the characteristics of the disaster situation in Anhui from meteorology, topography, farming, and historical records, and although we found out the three reforms methods to reduce disasters and tap potential from the performance of crops and from the superior climatic conditions, the problems of whether these methods are suitable for actual conditions and how to implement them were not solved at first. We finally solved these problems. Chairman Mao often taught us to study hard, especially to be primary school students and learn from the masses. We followed this path and carried out various tasks. In addition to building a small experimental field to prove whether various assumptions are applicable, the most important thing is to understand many farming conditions in rural areas, learn from old farmers, and find out many existing production experiences in rural areas. Therefore, we solved many problems that we could not solve originally. The following points are worth mentioning here:

	(1) The problem of increasing the summer harvest. At first, we only thought of expanding the autumn and winter sowing area and transplanting sorghum in the harvested low-lying wheat fields. Although this is feasible, simply expanding the autumn and winter sowing area will reduce spring land; if the transplanting method is completely adopted, more labor will be required. Later, the masses created the intercropping method of "two ridges leaning on each other," which overcame the difficulty of transplanting and solved the problem of intercropping wheat, cotton, and many other crops. As a result, under the condition of expanding the autumn and winter sowing area, not only did the spring land not decrease, but the spring land increased. At the same time, in order to expand the summer harvest, they also implemented many methods of intercropping and mixed planting, such as mixing wheat and peas (mixing the two seeds together for sowing), which can not only achieve full seedlings, but also reproduce rhizobia to increase fertilizer for wheat.

	(2) The problem of three seasons of continuous cropping. Three seasons of continuous cropping is not an easy thing to promote. At first, although we repeatedly called for three seasons of continuous cropping to expand the sowing index, the promotion was very slow. Later, after the practice of the masses, three methods were proposed to solve the problem of stubble, such as "raising seedlings and transplanting," "intercropping," and "adjusting varieties," and the situation was opened up. Because these three methods have a common advantage, that is, they can buy time and overcome the difficulty of not being able to promote three seasons of continuous cropping on a large scale due to lack of time. These three methods have their own advantages and disadvantages: "Raising seedlings and transplanting" can make the roots deep and the leaves lush, but it requires more labor; "intercropping" can save labor, but it has a slight impact on the development of seedlings; "adjusting varieties" (that is, arranging crops with short growing periods according to three seasons of continuous cropping in a planned way) is a more appropriate method, but in areas with longer frost periods, there are still difficulties in adjusting. However, as long as we can adapt to local conditions, these three methods can be used to overcome the difficulty of expanding the multiple cropping index.

	(3) The problem of planting double-cropping rice. At first, we were not very confident. Especially after hearing the saying that double-cropping rice cannot cross the Lingnan or cannot cross the Jiangbei, it increased our concerns even more. However, after investigating and summarizing the experience of individual double-cropping rice planting among the masses, determining the varieties and farming methods of early and late rice, and developing technologies such as seedling raising and cellar seedlings, we found that not only Jiangbei can plant double-cropping rice, but also Huaibei can plant double-cropping rice. Therefore, in 1954, we boldly developed double-cropping rice in the north and south of the Yangtze River, and in 1955, we also conducted a trial planting in the Huaibei area (which has been successful), and we will gradually promote it in Huaibei this year.

	(4) The problem of potato degradation. Potatoes are crops of cold climates. Planting them in hot climates is not only easy to degrade, but also difficult to store. Now, due to the improvement of potato cellars, the difficulty of storage has been overcome; but the solution to the degradation problem still needs continued efforts. We have already found potato varieties that do not degrade among the masses. We have good data for learning and researching this problem, and it is estimated that the potato degradation problem can also be solved.

	(5) The problem of water conservancy and fertilizer. Expanding the multiple cropping index requires an increase in water and fertilizer. We were also worried about this problem. However, in the past two years, there have also been some new creations in these areas. In the past, during winter repairs, the pond water was often drained and then mud was dug, which consumed a lot of water; now, mud is dug with water, and the amount of earthwork dug every day is not only not less than in the past, but also more. Another method is to raise the ridges of some rice fields to store water; adopting this method is not only easy to do, but also can save another part of the rice fields for sowing summer harvest crops, and can also save pond water for summer drought resistance when transplanting rice. In terms of fertilizer, not only can fields planted with two seasons be planted with a season of green manure, but also fields planted with three seasons can be intercropped with a season of green manure. Therefore, green manure can be greatly increased. The draft national agricultural development program mentions that 90% of fertilizers in some places and 100% in some places should be solved by local authorities. We believe that a large number of intercropping green manure will be one of the important measures to solve this problem.

There are many such methods, but these are just a few examples. Some of these methods were improved from the original experience of the masses, and some were new creations of the masses. In short, they were all learned from the masses. The reason why they are applicable, so popular with the masses, and so able to be enriched by the wisdom of the broad masses is that they are things that come from the masses and go to the masses. This is our second experience.

	We must fight tenaciously and persevere to the end

	After the "three reforms" method was proposed, it received a response from the broad masses and support and concern from many people. However, there were also many people who held skeptical, mocking, and critical attitudes towards the "three reforms" method. We did not waver in our determination because of these criticisms; on the contrary, we boldly persisted. Chairman Mao always taught us to be combative, to break superstitions, and to carry out work with the same tenacity as "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." Therefore, the words of "Wise Old Man" did not play a role in our minds.

What exactly were some of the criticisms? In the past two or three years, we have seen and heard about the following:

The first type believed that it "would not work." They said that although the principle of the "three reforms" is plausible, the actual situation may not be the case. Their reasons were: Expanding the autumn and winter sowing area (increasing peas, broad beans, and wheat) will reduce the spring planting (sorghum) area; increasing the planting of late autumn crops will delay the planting of wheat; implementing three seasons of continuous cropping will exploit the fertility of the land and reduce the harvest in the coming year; planting double-cropping rice will not only lack labor, fertilizer, and water, but also have insufficient temperature. Therefore, they said that the "three reforms" is a "more harm than good" method, and a "would not work" method. At first glance, this statement seems to make sense, but as long as the problem is revealed, it can be proved that the opinions they put forward were not based on careful research. They thought that the "three reforms" was an illusion from the office, but they did not know that we had been investigating and researching for two or three years. Just talk about the number of land, they do not understand that Anhui has a total of 91 million mu of cultivated land, excluding cash crops, there are 71 million mu of land that can be sown with summer harvest crops; however, the actual sown summer harvest crops are far from this number (this year's summer harvest crop area is the highest year, but it is only 64.4 million mu). They did not understand that by adopting the method of intercropping wheat and sorghum, the spring land not only does not decrease, but also increases greatly. Regarding the problem that planting late autumn crops will affect the planting of wheat, it is obvious that they do not understand that Anhui already has a method to solve the problem of stubble in three seasons of continuous cropping (this method has been discussed earlier); since the problem of stubble has been solved, it will not affect the planting of wheat in fact. Is the temperature sufficient for planting double-cropping rice? At first, we were also very worried about this problem; however, after studying the temperature and frost-free period in various parts of the province, and finding many ways to solve the problem of stubble, we affirmed that not only Jiangbei but also Huaibei can plant double-cropping rice. The frost-free period in Huaibei is about 230 to 240 days; the time required for double-cropping rice, including seedling raising, is no more than 200 days in total. The average temperature in Huaibei from April to October is about 23 degrees, and the temperature during the flowering season of late rice (around White Dew) is about 25 degrees, which is also sufficient for the needs of double-cropping rice. Is the labor force sufficient? The second season of rice is interspersed in the gap between the summer harvest and the autumn harvest, and both manpower and animal power have a surplus. Regarding the problems of fertilizer, water use, and "three seasons of continuous cropping exploiting the fertility of the land," they can be completely solved under the conditions of high production enthusiasm and improved production technology of farmers after cooperation. Facts have proved that this is the case. If we still look at this problem with the old mind and use the method of leaving land for the rich peasants to rest to deal with the problem of lack of fertilizer, we can only come to the conclusion of "more harm than good" and "would not work."

The second type believed that it "cannot be changed." They said that the current Chinese farming system is the crystallization of thousands of years of labor by farmers, and it cannot be easily changed. They euphemistically called it "the creation of laboring farmers," but in fact, they were covering up their right-leaning conservative ideology. Of course, we admit that Chinese laboring farmers have made great contributions to agricultural production; however, we must also see that in the past, imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism long ruled China, creating many situations that were unfavorable to production. For example, the extensive planting and low harvest in the Huaibei area was the result of the past reactionary rulers only caring about high exploitation and not solving the problem of floods and droughts. Another example is that many landlords changed many ponds and dikes into paddy fields, which was their practice of only caring about their own wealth and not caring about the life and death of others. Another example is that rich peasants have to leave many resting lands every year (cultivating for two years and resting for one year), which is because they have a lot of land and are unwilling to accumulate fertilizer for production, so they adopt the method of land resting to solve the problem of insufficient fertilizer. There are many such unreasonable phenomena. If they are not reformed, the level of agricultural production cannot be improved. Of course, this kind of reform was inconceivable in the era of reactionary rule; after land reform, especially agricultural cooperation, these reforms had a foundation, and the advanced experience of farmers had room for promotion and development.

The third type believed that it was "too risky." This mainly refers to changing to planting too many potatoes and having no confidence in changing to planting double-cropping rice. They said, "Anhui has no habit of planting potatoes, and too many potato seeds have been transferred, which cannot be preserved, and they will know the suffering after eating it." They also said, "The temperature is not enough for planting double-cropping rice, and it is difficult to succeed." Of course, this is their good intention, but they do not understand that the problem of potato preservation has been solved, and there is already a foundation for the habit of planting potatoes (in the past, Anhui had 12,000 mu of potato seed land); they do not understand even more that it is impossible to avoid the difficulty of easy water accumulation in low-lying areas without a large number of developing early-maturing potato crops. As for planting double-cropping rice, since the conditions are so complete (as mentioned earlier) and the experiment has been successful, what reason is there not to plant it in large quantities! Looking at it now, it is not that it is planted too much, but that it is planted too little. Why do some people insist on saying that it is "risky"? The reason lies in the trouble of "crawling thinking."

The fourth type is "finding faults." For example, in 1954, we called on to keep regenerated rice to tide over the famine. Some people, because of a lack of experience, harvested less (some also harvested very well), and some people blamed this on the "three reforms" ruining it. In fact, there is no item of keeping regenerated rice in the "three reforms." At that time, calling on to cultivate regenerated rice was only a temporary measure taken because the disaster situation was tense and there were not enough seeds, and it had nothing to do with the "three reforms." Another example is that individual places do have shortcomings in the promotion of the "three reforms," such as copying and applying mechanically and not paying attention to adapting to local conditions, and there are also acts of coercion and command, which of course need to be prevented and corrected. This is not because the "three reforms" method is wrong, but because of deviations in implementation. However, some people want to blame these on the "three reforms." Chairman Mao said very clearly: "We cannot ignore the non-essential aspects and non-mainstream aspects of the problem, and we must solve them one by one. However, we should not regard these as the essence and the mainstream, so as to confuse our direction." They are precisely regarding the non-essential and non-mainstream things as the essence and the mainstream.

The fifth type is spreading rumors and sabotage. For example, some counter-revolutionaries said that the "three reforms" is a "harmful pit," and that the potatoes we planted are "only the size of buttons." Another example is that a landlord in Fanchang deliberately mixed middle rice seeds in early rice seeds, and a rich peasant in Mengcheng deceived farmers to plant potatoes by using the method of "digging eyes and eating hearts" and "sealing soil with feet." They wanted to use these methods to sabotage the masses' planting plan. Of course, the sabotage of counter-revolutionaries and landlords and rich peasants is not surprising; however, what we should pay attention to here is that counter-revolutionaries will inevitably use conservative right-leaning ideas to carry out their conspiracy activities.

Comrade Chen Boda said in the explanation of the draft resolution on the problem of agricultural cooperation: "Any new force will encounter resistance from conservative forces." The same is true for the "three reforms" method. The reason why we were not overwhelmed by the conservative forces is because we carried out a tenacious struggle and persevered to the end. This is our third experience.

	We must strengthen leadership and solve various specific problems

From the very beginning, we realized that the "three reforms" is a reform of agricultural production habits and production methods. It is a matter of changing customs and habits, and it is an arduous and meticulous work. It is still a new seedling. It is weaker than the old production habits. It will inevitably be ridiculed, doubted, and opposed. It also needs many new technologies and a large amount of material support. Today, when we check, our work of promoting the "three reforms" is in line with the principles of "fast, more, good, and economical." We have statistically found that more than 99% of those who produce using the "three reforms" method have increased their yields. Less than 1% suffered seed and labor losses leading to reduced production due to not solving technical problems or violating the principle of adapting to local conditions. Here, we should also thank Chairman Mao, because if we had not carried out our work according to the leadership methods taught by Chairman Mao, we would never have been able to achieve such results.

What exactly did we do? The following are a few points that can be used for reference:

	(1) Conducted extensive publicity and mobilization. Here, we solved four problems: First, we affirmed that the "three reforms" is the basic measure for increasing agricultural production in Anhui Province, and it is a guarantee for supporting industry, strengthening national defense, overcoming disasters, and successfully completing the task of unified purchase and sale. Because we raised it to such an important position, we maintained the continuity of the "three reforms" work in any tense work situation. Second, we continued to criticize various right-leaning conservative ideas, and basically overcame various errors of not believing in advanced experience, not believing in improved varieties, and not believing in production reform. Third, we corrected the mistake of cadres not taking the lead in learning production technology, and promoted the relevant comrades of the party committees at all levels to study production and form a trend. Fourth, among the broad masses, especially in the disaster areas, we improved the confidence in overcoming disasters by relying on production reform. In the past three years, every winter and spring season, enlarged cadre meetings, labor model meetings, mutual aid and cooperation representative meetings, and township people's representative meetings were held at the provincial, county, and even district and township levels to discuss the "three reforms" problem and summarize the "three reforms" experience. From top to bottom, from inside the party to outside the party, from cadres to the masses, people generally understand the content and significance of the "three reforms." The publicity work of the "three reforms" has indeed reached the point where everyone knows it and everyone knows it, young and old.

	(2) Strengthened technical instruction work. In this regard, we have taken the following measures: First, we have established technical training classes, and in the past three years, we have trained more than 150,000 technical backbones for promoting the "three reforms" movement. Second, we have increased the number of technical promotion stations, from counties to districts, and now we have entered the stage of developing to townships and societies. Third, we have adopted the method of "inviting in to teach technology and sending out to learn technology." In 1954, we hired a model potato grower from Shandong to guide sprouting in our province. As a result, we were able to save 50 to 60 jin of potato seeds per mu, and since then, we have promoted the trend of hiring experts to guide the cultivation of special crops. In terms of changing to planting rice, we transferred a large number of cadres and labor models from Huaibei to the coastal areas to study, and transferred hundreds of people from the coastal areas to Huaibei for guidance. In addition, we also transferred some cadres to visit high-yield rice areas. In 1955, we sent more than 100 people to Liling, Hunan to visit double-cropping rice. In this way, we overcame the thinking of some farmers that "seeing is believing." Fourth, we summarized the production experience of the masses and organized field visits on the spot. For example, the agricultural production cooperative led by Gu Daocai in Yangwei Township, Yingshang County, changed to planting 60 mu of rice in 1955, and invited members of nearby societies to visit in time. As a result, it promoted the change to planting 820 mu of rice throughout the township. Another example is that after the farmer Jing Shengnian from Kuijing Township, Huaining County, introduced the successful experience of planting double-cropping rice, the township increased the planting of double-cropping rice by 1,700 mu. There are many such examples. This is an important reason why the "three reforms" can be promoted so quickly.

	(3) Seriously cultivate typical examples. All of our reform work is promoted after the typical examples have been successfully cultivated, so the development is relatively healthy. Based on the experience of cultivating typical examples in the past three years: First, the cultivation of typical examples should be "more points and less quantity," because if this is done, if successful, the promotion surface can be easily expanded, and if failed, the losses will not be much. Second, after the typical example is successfully cultivated and after sufficient ideological deliberation, we must boldly promote it and not hesitate to move forward. Third, those who fail due to lack of technology or violation of the principle of adapting to local conditions should be cared for and encouraged, and we should help them achieve victory in production reform. This is not only necessary to restore the "morale" of these people, but also a necessary measure to improve the confidence of the broad masses.

	(4) Do a good job in various material preparation work. The scope of the "three reforms" is very wide. Especially because the seeds, fertilizers, and water required for expanding the multiple cropping index and changing to planting high-yield crops, changing to using improved varieties, and changing to planting rice, etc., must be greatly increased, and some agricultural implements also need to be appropriately changed. This is an extremely arduous and huge task, so we must prepare properly to move forward smoothly. We have spent a lot of effort in this area in the past few years. We often have more than 200 cadres working in other provinces (not counting the assistance from fraternal provinces). In the past three years, more than 596.18 million jin of seeds have been transferred to Anhui from other provinces, including more than 331 million jin of potato seeds, more than 23 million jin of Victory No. 100 sweet potato seeds, more than 40 million jin of early rice seeds, more than 12.8 million jin of late rice seeds, and most of the others are late autumn crop seeds (for disaster relief). If these problems cannot be solved, the reform plan cannot be realized. In addition, we have also supplemented agricultural implements and waterwheels for areas that have changed dry land to paddy fields, and rebuilt the drills for strip-sowing wheat areas of "two ridges leaning on each other," which has also played a certain role in promoting the "three reforms" method.

	(5) Closely combine the "three reforms" work with the cooperative movement. We proposed in the winter before last year that agricultural production cooperatives are the organizational guarantee for promoting the "three reforms," and the "three reforms" is the strategic and tactical method for agricultural production cooperatives to achieve the requirements of increasing production. We have always carried them out closely together. In the process of carrying them out closely together, we have indeed achieved very good results. On the one hand, due to the organizational guarantee of agricultural production cooperatives, the "three reforms" has been promoted quickly and steadily; on the other hand, the "three reforms" method has improved the production increase index and also promoted the development of agricultural production cooperatives. Many farmers in Anhui say: Agricultural production cooperatives promoted the "three reforms," and the "three reforms" also promoted agricultural production cooperatives. Our future task is to further expand the scope of the "three reforms" and enrich the content, and strive to overfulfill the agricultural production targets stipulated in the draft national agricultural development program from 1956 to 1967 in Anhui.

The "three reforms" movement has developed very quickly, and its role has been increasing year by year. However, if the work is not carried out according to the correct leadership method, then the achievement of these results is impossible to imagine. This is our fourth experience.

Due to the above four experiences, we have further strengthened a general belief, that is: If we want to achieve a little success in our work, we must study Chairman Mao's works with our hearts, follow Chairman Mao's teachings, and master the ideological weapon of Marxism-Leninism.

    关于农业生产三项改革工作的几点体会
    中共安徽省委书记　曾希圣
    安徽省推行农业生产的三项改革（简称“三改”），到现在已经三年了。一般说来，进行的情况是良好的。第一、推广速度很快。1953年，即提出“三改”的第一年，按“三改”的要求进行生产的只有199.5亩，占全省产粮地的比率数很少；1954年达到5，392，036亩，为1953年的27，000倍，占全省产粮地的7.6％；1955年就达到23，039，518亩，为1954年的4.3倍，占全省产粮地的32.45％；今年预计可以达到4，000万亩左右，比去年约增加1，700万亩，占全省产粮地的56％强。第二、增产数量不小。1954年虽然遭受了特大洪水，但实行“三改”的结果仍然增产了67，000多万斤粮食，减少了水灾的损失；1955年全省共增产粮食47亿斤，其中由于实行“三改”而增产的为27亿斤，即按“三改”办法进行生产的土地平均每亩增产117斤。第三、干部和群众反映很好。不少干部说：领导生产，以前是渺渺茫茫的，自从推行“三改”以后，就有门路了。农民有的赞扬“三改”说：“‘三改’好，‘三改’好，庄稼的好法宝，能避灾，能抗涝，自从实行‘三改’后，多收粮食多收草。”有的赞扬“旱地改水田”说：“旱地改水田，一年抵三年。”有的赞扬种早稻说：“种早稻，处处好，旱不到，涝不了，稻虫没出世，稻子早收了。”有的赞扬种双季稻说：“双季稻，大胆干，两季收了高产量，就是受了灾，东方不亮西方亮。”（意思是说总能收一季）有的赞扬种马铃薯说：“马铃薯，产量高，成熟期短不怕涝，能当粮，能当菜，市场交易价钱好。”总之，由于实行“三改”避了灾，增了产，广大群众都很满意。在全省范围内把它普遍推广，已经不是怎样困难的问题了。今年是推行“三改”的第四年，我们原不打算再作什么介绍了，但是由于许多同志的鼓励和期望，因而只好就“三改”的提出和推广的情况写几点体会。
    “三改”内容虽然很平常，但它的提出和推广却经过艰苦的斗争。在这些艰苦斗争当中，我们有这样一些体会：
      必须深入钻研，找出问题的所在
    1953年提出“三改”以前，安徽的生产情形是这样：一方面，在全省范围特别是淮北，发生连续不断的严重水灾（五年四灾，其中1952年是最小的一次涝灾，也淹了田地1，280万亩，受灾人口348万），引起了广大群众和干部的不安；另一方面，在没有受灾的地区，生产确有增加，农民生活大为改善。在这种情况下，产生了以下几种混乱思想：第一种是悲观失望。有些人认为救灾无底，生产无望，虽然消灭了蒋灾，但消灭不了天灾，治淮也无济于事。有的干部要求调离灾区，不少群众打算向外逃荒，生产情绪无法提高。第二种是依赖等待。抱有这种思想的人，认为只有中央赶快修好淮河，多拨救济经费，生产才有指望，灾荒才能渡过。第三种是盲目麻痹。这一类人不理会灾情的严重困难，也不审查治淮的效果，照着“防洪不除涝”的老办法治理淮河。第四种是骄傲自满。没有灾情的地区的干部认为生产到顶，潜力已尽，并且说群众都是生产能手，用不着我们领导，只要合作社组织起来，就万事大吉了。怎样才能克服这些错误的思想偏向？怎样才能提高群众的生产情绪？怎样才能在遭到灾害的情况下保证较多的收成？怎样才能克服我们面前的实际困难和减少中央的救灾支付？当时，省委认为这些问题是我们在前进的道路上所必须解决的问题，是我们的领导工作能否发生应有作用的问题。因此，对这些问题进行了一系列的研究。毛主席教导我们说：“不论做什么事，不懂得那件事的情形，它的性质，它和它以外的事情的关联，就不知道那件事的规律，就不知道如何去做，就不能做好那件事。”（毛泽东选集163—164页）我们就是根据这个原则来进行钻研的。
    我们钻研的问题很多，其中最主要的是以下几个问题：
    一、安徽（特别是淮北）灾情究竟严重到什么程度？对这个问题，我们搜集了许多历史资料，证明每隔两三年就有一次程度不等的灾害出现。根据“淮系年表”的记载，淮北地区在两千年内曾发生过大小灾害980多次，平均每两年一次，大约涝旱各半。这就使我们了解到淮河灾害的经常性和严重性。
    二、安徽水灾为什么这样严重？一般的究竟发生在每年的什么时候？对这个问题，我们从三方面进行了研究。
    首先，从气象方面，我们理解了：印度洋的热气团，由于风向关系，常常在每年6、7月的时候开始和北面的冷气团交接于江南或者交接于淮北而形成暴雨，如果这两种气团相持不动，就在这个地区形成连续性的几个暴雨中心，所以常在7、8、9月之间发生严重水灾。每年的秋冬和春夏少雨，水量不够庄稼需要，所以常常形成旱灾。为了证实这种情况，我们又在淮北的许多地方，根据老年人的回忆和县志的记载，作了一百多年灾害的调查，证明水旱灾害大都在这些时候发生；并且证明每10年到30年内有一次较大的洪水灾害，5年左右有一次严重涝灾。这就使我们了解了淮北地区发生灾情的时间性，也可以说是一般的规律性。
    其次，对地形条件和社会根源也作了分析。安徽处在淮河的中游，又处在洪泽湖大堤的上游，下泄的水受了束缚，所以每逢汛期，上面来水不小，下面排泄不大。如1954年汛期上游来水175亿立方公尺，中游本身的水285亿立方公尺，共为460亿立方公尺，但三河坝流出的只有153亿立方公尺，还有307亿立方公尺停滞在洪泽湖以上。湖泽装了237亿立方公尺，停滞在蚌埠以上的有223亿立方公尺。从这里就可以知道安徽洪水情况的严重。在长江方面，安徽处在东、西凉山之上，情况也和淮河相同。淮河的特点是：一面临着广大平原，河床小，比降小，流速慢，沉淀多，易于淤塞，容易发生涝灾；另一面则紧靠大山，来水陡而急，容易形成洪水灾害。另外，淮河曾多次遭受黄河侵袭，特别是花园口掘开以后，大小河道更加淤塞垫高，泄洪系统完全被破坏了。因此，每当暴雨到来，干河的水高于支河，支河的水高于平地，年年发生大小不等的涝灾。
    再次，我们从耕作情况方面研究了这个地区容易受涝的道理。淮河流域雨量集中在七、八、九月，但比长江以南的雨量还是要小一些；其所以容易成灾，是由于芝麻、绿豆不耐水，雨水稍大，就被淹坏或淹死。但如果种稻子，三、四百公厘的雨不仅无害，而且有利。可是，淮北人民为什么不按江南习惯种稻子，而按北方习惯种旱粮呢？主要是因为五、六月下种时候缺少雨水，插不下秧，同时七、八、九月也不是年年多雨，因此群众没有能力也没有信心种稻子。
    三、我们比较了各种作物的耐水耐旱性能和播种期的早迟、成熟期的长短；并且调查了安徽地区长江南北和淮河南北无霜期的长短情况。
    我们做了以上这些基本工作，就进一步地考虑到怎样战胜灾害，怎样避开灾害，怎样发挥生产潜力，怎样做到花钱少、收效快等问题了。
    在战胜水旱灾害方面，我们不仅没有低估治淮的成绩，而且强调了治淮的作用；但我们改变了那种只谈“防洪保堤”、不讲“除涝保收”的旧治淮观点，改变了那种单纯等待治淮的依赖思想。我们从避开生产中的不利条件和发挥生产中的有利条件这一个基本要求出发，提出了“改种避灾”、“改种增产”、“防灾与生产相结合”的办法，这就是我们所谈的“三改”。
      “三改”的内容究竟是什么？第一个改革就是扩大秋冬播种面积，提高夏季收成比重和尽可能地增种一季晚秋，争取在全年生产中三季连作，以扩大复种指数。这个办法的好处在于从季候中避开水灾和旱灾，从增种一季晚秋发挥气候的优越条件。第二个改革就是改种高产作物，改种耐水耐旱作物，改用优良品种，以及旱地改水田，水田改旱地等等。这个办法的好处在于利用作物的特性抗御灾害，利用品种的优越性提高产量，用因地制宜的办法预先防止灾害。第三个改革就是改变广种薄收的陋习，改良耕作方法。这个办法的好处在于从改革生产技术上来提高产量。总而言之，“三改”内容是“耕作制度”、“作物品种”、“耕作方法”的改革，是在水利工程还来不及全面兴办的时候，一面避开水旱灾害，一面挖掘“天力”、“地力”、“物力”的有效办法。我们之所以只提“三改”的原因就在于此。
    我们认为，“三改”办法是适合安徽情况的。它之所以能够适合安徽情况，是因为它是经过了认真的调查研究的结果。这是我们的第一点体会。
          必须相信群众，向群众学习
    我们虽然从气象、地形、耕作等方面以及历史记载里找出了和证明了安徽灾情的特点。虽然从作物的性能，从气候的优越条件，找出了减少灾害、挖掘潜力的三项改革办法，但是，这些办法是不是适合实际，究竟怎样实施，最初还是没有解决的问题。我们终于把这些问题解决了。毛主席经常教导我们努力学习，特别是要我们做一个小学生，向群众学习。我们遵循着这个门径，进行了各项工作。我们除一面建立了一个小型试验场来证明各种假设是否适用以外，最主要的是到农村中了解了许多耕作情况，向老农学习，找出了农村中原有的许多生产经验。因此，就解决了我们原来所不能解决的许多问题。这里值得提出的有以下几点：
      （一）提高夏季收成问题。最初，我们只想到扩大秋冬播种面积和在收获了的洼地麦田里移栽高粱这两个办法。这虽然是可行的，但是，单纯扩大秋冬播种面积就要减少春地；如果完全采用移栽的办法，就要多花劳动力。后来，群众创造了“二垅靠”的间种办法，就克服了移栽的困难，而且解决了麦棉以及许多作物的间种问题。结果，在扩大秋冬播种面积的情况下，不仅不减少春地，反而增加了春地。同时他们为了扩大夏季收获量，还实行了许多套种、混种的办法，如豌麦混种（两项种子混合一起下种），不仅可以达到全苗，而且能够繁殖根瘤菌为麦子增加肥料。
      （二）三季连作问题。三季连作不是一件容易推广的事情。在最初，我们虽然也一再号召三季连作，扩大播种指数，但推行得很慢。后来，经过群众的实践，提出了“育苗移栽”“套种间作”“调剂品种”等三个解决茬口问题的办法，局面就打开了。因为这三个办法有一个共同的好处，就是可以争取时间，克服常常因时间不够而不能大量推行三季连作的困难。这三个办法各有各的好处和缺点：“育苗移栽”能够做到根深叶茂，但需要劳力较多；“套种间作”能节省劳力，但对幼苗的发育稍有影响；“调剂品种”（就是把生长期短的作物有计划地按三季连作安排）是比较适当的办法，但在霜期较长的地区，仍有调剂不易的困难。不过，只要我们能够因地制宜，这三个办法都是可以用来克服扩大复种指数的困难的。
      （三）种双季稻问题。最初，我们也把握不大。特别是听到双季稻不能过岭北或不能过江北的说法，就更加加大了我们的顾虑。但是，我们在调查和总结了群众中个别种双季稻的经验，确定了早、晚稻的品种和耕作方法以及发展了育苗、窖秧等项技术之后，就发现了不仅江北可以种双季稻，而且淮北也可以种双季稻。因此，在1954年就大胆地在长江南北地区发展了双季稻，1955年在淮北地区也进行了试种（已成功），今年在淮北也要逐步推广了。
      （四）马铃薯的退化问题。马铃薯是气候冷的地方的作物，在气候较热的地方种植，不仅容易退化，而且不易保管。现在，由于薯窖的改良，已经克服了保管的困难；但退化问题的解决还需要继续努力。我们已经在群众中发现了不退化的薯种，学习和研究这个问题有了良好的资料，估计马铃薯的退化问题也是可以解决的。
      （五）水利和肥料问题。扩大复种指数，水和肥料都要增加。我们也曾为这个问题担心。但是，两年来，在这些方面也有了一些新的创造。以往冬修，往往把塘水放掉，然后挖泥，因而耗水不少；现在实行带水挖泥，每天挖的土方不但不比过去少，而且还多一些。还有一种办法是把一部分冲田的田埂抬高，用以蓄水；采取这种办法，不仅工程容易做，而且可以把另一部分冲田节省出来播种夏收作物，还可以在插秧的时候不用塘水，节省塘水供给夏季抗旱用。在肥料方面，不仅种两季的田地可以再种一季绿肥，就是种三季的田地也可以套种一季绿肥。因此，绿肥可以大大增加。全国农业发展纲要草案中说到肥料在某些地方的90％、某些地方的100％要由地方解决。我们认为，大量套种绿肥，将是解决这个问题的重要措施之一。
    诸如此类的办法，还有很多，这里不过是举几个例子而已。这些办法，有的是由群众原有的经验提高起来的，有的是群众的新创造。总而言之，都是从群众那里学来的。它们之所以适用，所以受群众欢迎，所以能够被广大群众的智慧充实起来，就因为它们是从群众中来又到群众中去的东西。这是我们的第二点体会。
          必须顽强斗争，坚持到底
      “三改”办法提出以后，得到了广大群众的响应，得到了不少人的支持和关怀。但是，也有不少人对“三改”办法抱着怀疑、讥笑和非难的态度。我们没有因为这些非难而动摇决心；相反，我们大胆地坚持下来了。毛主席一向教导我们要有斗争性，要打破迷信，要用“愚公移山”那样的顽强性来进行工作。因此，“智叟”的话就不在我们的脑子里起作用了。
    究竟有一些什么非难呢？在两三年当中，我们亲眼见到的和亲耳听到的大概有这么一些：
    第一种是认为“行不通”。他们说“三改”的道理虽然说得过去，但实际未必如此。他们的理由是：扩大了秋冬播种面积（增加豌豆、蚕豆和麦子），就要减少春种（高粱）面积；增种了晚秋作物，就要延误种麦子；实行三季连作，就剥削了地力，会减少来年收成；种双季稻，不仅劳动力、肥料、水不够，而且气温不足。因此，他们说“三改”是“得不偿失”的办法，是“行不通”的办法。这种说法，初看好像有道理，但只要把问题揭开，就可以证明他们提出的意见不是经过细致研究的。他们以为“三改”是从办公室空想出来的，殊不知我们已经调查研究了两三年。就说土地数目吧，他们不了解，安徽共有9，100万亩耕地，除去经济作物，还有7，100万亩地可以播种夏收作物；但是，实际播种的夏收作物同此数相差甚远（今年夏收作物面积是最高的一年，也不过6，440万亩）。他们不了解，采用麦、秫套种办法，春地不但不减少，而且大量增加。关于种了晚秋作物就会影响种麦的问题，很明显，他们不了解，在安徽已经有了解决三季连作的茬口问题的办法（这办法前面已经谈了）；既然解决了茬口问题，事实上就不会影响种麦子。种双季稻的气温够不够呢？最初，我们对这个问题也很担心；但是，在研究了全省各地的温度和无霜期的情况，并且找到了许多解决茬口问题的办法以后，我们就肯定了不仅江北而且淮北也可以播种双季稻。淮北的无霜期有230到240天左右；双季稻所需时间，包括下秧在内，两季最多也不过200天。淮北温度从4月到10月平均有23度左右，晚稻扬花时节（在白露前后）的温度在25度左右，也足够双季稻的需要。劳动力够不够用呢？第二季稻正穿插在夏收后秋收前的空隙中，人力畜力都有余裕。关于肥料、用水以及“三季连作剥削地力”等问题，在合作化以后，农民生产情绪高涨，生产技术改进的情况下，完全可以解决。事实证明正是如此。如果仍然用旧脑筋来看这个问题，用富农留休息地的办法来处理缺少肥料的问题，当然只能得出“得不偿失”“行不通”的结论。
    第二种是认为“改不得”。他们说中国现行耕作制度是几千年劳动农民创造的结晶，不容许轻易改变。他们美其名曰“劳动农民的创造”，实际上是为右倾保守思想打掩护。我们当然承认中国劳动农民在农业生产上有伟大贡献；但是，我们也必须看到，过去帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义长期统治中国，造成了许许多多对于生产不利的情形。如淮北地区的广种薄收，就是过去反动统治者只顾高度剥削，不解决水旱灾害问题所造成的结果。又如好些地主把许多塘堰改成水田，就是他们只顾自己发财致富、不顾他人死活的作法。再如富农每年都要留出许多休息地（耕两年休息一年），就是因他们土地多，而又不愿意积肥生产，所以采取土地休息办法来解决肥料不足的问题。这样不合理的现象很多，如果不加以改革，农业生产水平就无法提高。当然，这种改革在反动统治时代是不可思议的；在土地改革特别是农业合作化以后，这些改革就有了基础，农民的先进经验就有推广和发展的余地了。
    第三种是认为“太冒险”。主要是指改种马铃薯太多，改种双季稻没有把握。他们说“安徽没有种马铃薯的习惯，而且薯种调得太多，无法保存，吃了苦头才会知道”。又说“种双季稻，气温不够，难以成功”。这当然是他们的好意，但他们不了解，马铃薯的保存问题已经解决，种马铃薯的习惯早有基础（过去安徽就有12，000亩种薯地）；他们更不了解，不大量发展早熟作物的马铃薯，就不可能避开低洼地区容易积水的困难。至于种双季稻，条件既然如此完备（前面已经谈了），而且已经试验成功，又有什么理由不要大种呢！现在来看，不是种得太多，而是种得太少了。为什么有人硬说“冒险”了呢？原因就在于“爬行思想”作怪。
    第四种是“找岔子”。如1954年我们曾号召留再生稻渡荒，有的因为缺乏经验，收获较少（也有的收获很好），有人把这也归咎于“三改”搞坏了。其实，“三改”中并无留再生稻一项。在当时号召培养再生稻，只是因为灾情紧张、种子不够而采取的一个临时办法，同“三改”毫无关系。又如，极个别的地方在推行“三改”中确有照抄照套、不注意因地制宜的缺点，也有强迫命令的行为出现，这当然是需要防止和纠正的。这并不是“三改”办法不对，而是执行中的偏差。可是，有人把这些都要加罪于“三改”。毛主席说得很清楚：“不能忽略非本质方面和非主流方面的问题，必须逐一地将它们解决。但是，不应当将这些看成为本质和主流，以致迷惑了自己的方向。”他们正是把非本质非主流的东西看成本质和主流了。
    第五种是造谣破坏。如有些反革命分子说“三改”是“害人坑”，说我们种的马铃薯“只有扣子大”。又如繁昌一个地主故意把中稻种子混在早稻种子内，蒙城一个富农欺骗农民用“挖眼吃心”、“脚踩封土”的办法播种马铃薯。他们想用这些办法来破坏群众的改种计划。当然，反革命分子和地主、富农的破坏是不足为奇的；但是，这里值得我们注意的是，反革命分子必然会利用保守右倾思想来进行他们的阴谋活动。
    陈伯达同志在关于农业合作化问题的决议草案的说明中说：“任何新生力量都会遇到保守力量的抵抗。”“三改”办法也是一样。我们所以没有被保守力量压倒，就是因为进行了顽强的斗争，坚持到底。这是我们的第三点体会。
      必须加强领导，解决各种具体问题
    我们一开始就认识到“三改”是农业生产习惯和生产方法的改革，是一个移风易俗的问题，是一件艰苦细致的工作。它还是新生的幼芽，它比旧的生产习惯软弱，它必然会遭到讥笑、怀疑和反对。它还需要许多新的技术和有大量的物质力量支持。今天来检查，我们推广“三改”的工作是同“快、多、好、省”的原则相符合的。我们统计，采取“三改”办法生产的，有99％以上增加了产量。由于没有解决技术问题或者违背了因地制宜的原则而耗损了种子、劳力以致减产的，不到1％。这里我们也应该感谢毛主席，因为如果不是按照毛主席教导的领导方法来进行工作，我们绝不可能得到这样的效果。
    我们究竟做了一些什么工作呢？可以提供参考的有这么几点：
      （一）进行了广泛的宣传动员。在这里，我们解决了4个问题：第一、肯定了“三改”是安徽省农业增产的基本措施，是支援工业、加强国防、战胜灾荒、顺利地完成统购统销任务的保证。因为把它提高到这样重要的地位，所以在任何工作紧张的情况下都保持了“三改”工作的经常性。第二、继续不断地批判了各种右倾保守思想，基本上克服了不相信先进经验、不相信优良品种、不相信生产改革的各种错误。第三、纠正了干部不带头学习生产技术的错误，推动了各级党委的有关同志钻研生产，形成风气。第四、在广大群众中，特别是在灾区，提高了依靠生产改革战胜灾害的信心。三年来，每年冬春季节，在省、县以至区、乡都分别召集了干部扩大会议、劳动模范会议、互助合作代表会议、乡人民代表会议，讨论“三改”问题，总结“三改”经验。从上到下，从党内到党外，从干部到群众，一般都懂得“三改”的内容和意义。“三改”的宣传工作，确实达到了家喻户晓，老少皆知的地步。
      （二）加强了技术传授工作。在这方面，我们采取了以下的一些措施：第一、开办了技术训练班，三年中训练了推广“三改”运动的技术骨干15万多人。第二、增设了技术推广站，由县到区，现在已进到向乡、向社发展的阶段。第三、采取了“请进来传授技术，派出去学习技术”的办法。1954年我们从山东聘请了一位种薯模范到我省指导催芽，结果一亩地就能节省薯种五、六十斤，并且从此推动了聘请专家指导特种作物耕作的风气。在改种水稻方面，我们从淮北抽调大批干部和劳动模范到沿江地区学习，又从沿江地区抽调了几百人到淮北进行指导。此外，还抽调了一些干部到稻作高产区观摩。1955年，我们就派了100多人到湖南醴陵参观双季稻。这样，就克服了某些农民“眼不见不相信”的思想。第四、总结了群众生产经验，就地组织了田间观摩。例如颍上县杨圩乡顾道才领导的农业生产合作社1955年改种60亩水稻，及时邀请附近各社社员参观，结果，推动全乡改种水稻820亩。又如怀宁县盔井乡，由农民经声年介绍了种双季稻成功的经验以后，全乡增种双季稻1，700亩。这样的例子是很多的。这是“三改”能够很快地推广的一个重要原因。
      （三）认真培养典型。我们的各项改革工作，都是在典型培养成功之后再推广的，所以发展得比较健康。根据三年来培养典型工作的体会：第一、典型的培养要“点多、量少”，因为这样做，成功则推广面容易扩大，失败则损失不多。第二、典型培养成功、经过充分思想酝酿之后，就要大胆推广，不要裹足不前。第三、对因为技术缺乏或者违背了因地制宜的原则而失败的，要予以关照和鼓励，要帮助他取得生产改革的胜利。这不仅可以挽回这些人的“士气”，而且是提高广大群众信心的必要措施。
      （四）作好各项物质准备工作。“三改”的范围很广，特别因为扩大复种指数和改种高产作物、改用优良品种、改种水稻等等所需要的种子、肥料、用水都要大量增加，有些农具也需要适当改变，这是一项极为繁重和庞大的任务，因此，必须妥为准备，才能顺利前进。我们这几年在这方面是花了不少力量的，我们经常有两百多干部在外省活动（兄弟省份给我们的帮助力量还不计算在内），三年中从外省调到安徽的种子即有59，618万多斤，其中马铃薯种33，100多万斤，胜利百号甘薯种2，300多万斤，早稻种4，000多万斤，晚稻种1，280多万斤，其他大部分是晚秋作物种子（为救灾用的）。如果这些问题不能得到解决，改革计划就无法实现。此外，我们还为旱地改水田的地区补充了农具、水车，为“二垄靠”的条播小麦地区改制了耩子，这对推行“三改”办法也起了一定的作用。
      （五）把“三改”工作同合作化运动密切结合起来。我们在前年冬天就提出了农业生产合作社是推行“三改”的组织保证，“三改”是农业生产合作社达到增产要求的战略战术。我们一向就是把它们密切结合起来进行的。在把它们密切结合进行当中，的确取得了很好成绩。一方面，由于农业生产合作社这个组织保证，使“三改”推行得又快又稳；一方面，由于“三改”办法提高了增产指数，也促进了农业生产合作社的发展。安徽的许多农民都说：农业生产合作社推动了“三改”，“三改”也推动了农业生产合作社。我们今后的任务是要把“三改”的范围更加扩大，内容更加充实起来，为1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要草案所规定的农业生产指标在安徽超额完成而奋斗。
    “三改”运动发展得很快，它的作用已一年一年地提高。但是，如果不是按照正确的领导方法来进行工作，那么这些成绩的取得是不可能设想的。这是我们的第四点体会。
    由于以上四点体会，更使我们增强了一个总的信念，这就是：如果我们想要在工作中做出一点成绩，就必须用心学习毛主席的著作，遵循毛主席的教导，掌握马克思列宁主义的思想武器。
