    Employee Cafeterias Should Be Run Well
            (I) To the Editor:
    The employee cafeteria at our Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant is terribly run. The procedure for buying meal tickets is extremely troublesome, requiring an introduction letter, a “mess permit,” and requiring five people to group together to buy them. The location for buying meal tickets changes constantly; this month it’s stipulated to be sold in the cafeteria, next month it’s changed to the welfare department, and the month after that it’s changed to the welfare officers of each unit. As a result, many employees often have to run back and forth several times to buy meal tickets, or stand in line for a long time only to not be able to buy them. The factory stipulates that wages are paid twice a month, but the welfare department stipulates that meal tickets are only sold once a month, which often worries many employees with lower wages.
    The quality of the cafeteria food is very low, mostly clear soup with little oil. However, the price of the food keeps rising. Previously, a meat stew dish sold for 10 cents, then it was changed to 15 cents, and now it has risen to 20 cents.
    The rice and steamed buns sold in the cafeteria are also frequently underweight. A large bowl of rice should be four liang of rice, but it is actually less than three liang; a steamed bun should be two liang of flour, but it is actually less than two liang. The price of grain on the market has not increased, but the price of rice and steamed buns in the cafeteria is arbitrarily increased. In addition, the cafeteria's sanitation work is also very poor. Potatoes contain sand, steamed buns contain hair, and the dishes are not washed clean, which are common occurrences; in the summer, sometimes there are even flies in the dishes.
    We suggest that our cafeteria management improve their service attitude, learn some advanced experience from outside the factory, and earnestly take on the responsibility of serving the employees.

            (II) To the Editor:
    The employee cafeteria at the Xiaotun Cement Plant in Liaoyang City is poorly run. Starting last year, the factory leadership stipulated that the furniture, fuel, management fees, and labor protection costs and part of the wages of the cooks in the cafeteria should be borne by the workers. The cafeteria management personnel, in implementing this regulation, have forgotten the principle of serving the working masses and are enthusiastically pursuing profits. In the past year, this cafeteria, which often only has 400 people eating, had a profit of more than 4,000 yuan. Therefore, the food in this cafeteria is very expensive and of poor quality. The employees spend a lot of money, but they don't eat well. The management of the cafeteria is very chaotic. In winter, employees often cannot get hot meals, which affects their health. In addition, the sanitary conditions in the cafeteria are also very poor.
    The factory leadership is aware of this situation, but they have not paid attention to solving this problem. We believe that running employee cafeterias well is not only of great importance to ensuring the physical health of employees, but also can boost employee morale. The Xiaotun Cement Plant should care about the welfare of its employees and improve the work of the cafeteria.

    应该办好职工食堂
            （一）编辑同志：
    我们太原钢铁厂的职工食堂办得很糟糕。买饭票的手续非常麻烦，既要介绍信，又要“起伙证”，还得五个人凑在一起买；买饭票的场所，这个月规定在食堂卖，下个月改到福利科卖，再下个月又改在各单位的福利员处卖。因此很多职工往往买一趟饭票要来回跑几次，或者站半天队还买不上饭票。厂里规定每个月的工资分两次发，福利科却规定饭票一个月只卖一次，许多工资较低的职工就经常为此发愁。
    食堂的菜质量很低，大部分是白汤清水，很少有油。但是菜的价钱却不断提高。以前一个肉烩菜卖1角钱，后来改成1角5分，现在上升为2角。
    食堂出卖的米饭和馒头还经常是分量不足的。一碗大米饭应该是四两米，实际上还不够三两米；一个馒头应该是二两面，实际上是不够二两的。市上粮食没有涨价，食堂里的米饭和馒头却任意涨价。此外，食堂的卫生工作也作得很差。土豆里有泥沙，馒头里有头发，碗筷没有洗干净，这是常见的事；到了夏天，有时菜里还有苍蝇。
    建议我们的食堂管理人员改进服务态度，到厂外去学习些先进经验，切实负起为职工服务的职责。

            （二）编辑同志：
    辽阳市小屯水泥厂职工食堂办得很不好。从去年开始，工厂领导方面规定食堂里的家具、燃料、管理费以及炊事员的劳动保护费用和一部分工资都要工人负担。食堂管理人员在执行这个规定的时候更是忘记了为职工群众服务的方针，热中地追求利润。去年一年中间，这个经常只有400人吃饭的食堂，就有利润4，000多元。因此，这个食堂的菜很贵，质量很差。职工们花了很多钱，可是吃得不好。食堂的管理工作非常混乱。冬天，职工们经常吃不到热饭热菜，影响了身体健康。此外，食堂的卫生情况也很不好。
    对于这种情况，工厂领导方面是知道的，但是他们一直没有注意解决这个问题。我们认为，办好职工食堂，不仅对保障职工的身体健康有重大关系，而且也可以鼓舞职工的生产情绪。小屯水泥厂应该关心职工的生活福利，改进食堂的工作。
