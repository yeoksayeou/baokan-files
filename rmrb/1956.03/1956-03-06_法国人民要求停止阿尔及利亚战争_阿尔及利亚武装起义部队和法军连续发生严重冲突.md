    French People Demand End to Algerian War
    Algerian Armed Uprising Forces and French Troops Continuously Engage in Serious Clashes
    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 3rd: The French people are widely launching a movement demanding an immediate end to the Algerian War. The National Committee for a Peaceful Resolution of the North African Problem issued a statement on March 2nd saying: In the past three days, hundreds of delegations of French working people have come to Paris from all over the country. They demand that parliamentarians advocate an immediate halt to military operations and colonial repression in Algeria.
    The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party issued a statement on the issue of relations between France and Algeria. The statement pointed out that military operations in Algeria consume tens of billions of francs and cost many lives. This situation has caused understandable anxiety among the French people. The French Communist Party advocates maintaining political, economic, and cultural ties between France and Algeria, believing that this is in the interests of both peoples. However, such ties can only be maintained if the Algerian people have the opportunity to freely express their opinions on this issue. The French Communist Party suggests striving for a ceasefire, stopping repressive measures, and releasing all prisoners. This would allow the French government to hold sincere negotiations with representatives of various tendencies of the national movement and all social strata of the Algerian people in order to establish new relations between the two countries on an equal footing.
    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 2nd: According to French newspapers, the most serious clashes have occurred between French troops and Algerian armed uprising forces in the Aurès and Constantine regions. In the past 24 hours, 46 Algerians have been killed, and there have been casualties on the French side as well.
    The newspapers say that due to the solidarity of the local residents with the uprising army, and because the "Algerian War" is extremely unpopular among French soldiers, it is becoming increasingly difficult for French troops to carry out combat operations.

    法国人民要求停止阿尔及利亚战争
    阿尔及利亚武装起义部队和法军连续发生严重冲突
    新华社据塔斯社巴黎3日讯  法国人民广泛展开要求立即停止阿尔及利亚战争的运动。争取和平解决北非问题全国委员会在3月2日发表声明说：在最近三天里，有几百个法国劳动人民代表团从全国各地来到巴黎。它们要求议员们主张立刻停止阿尔及利亚的军事行动和殖民镇压。
    法国共产党中央委员会政治局就法国同阿尔及利亚的关系问题发表了声明。声明指出，阿尔及利亚的军事行动消耗数以百亿计的法郎，并且使许多人牺牲生命。这种情况引起了法国人民理所当然的耽忧。法国共产党主张保持法国和阿尔及利亚之间在政治、经济和文化方面的联系，认为这是符合两国人民的利益的。但是，只有在阿尔及利亚人民有机会对这个问题自由地表示意见的条件下，才能保持这种联系。法国共产党建议争取停火，停止镇压措施以及释放所有囚犯。这样就可以使法国政府同阿尔及利亚人民的各种倾向的民族运动和各社会阶层的代表举行诚恳的谈判，以便在平等基础上建立两国之间的新关系。
    新华社据塔斯社巴黎2日讯  据法国报纸报道，法国军队和阿尔及利亚武装起义部队在奥雷斯和君士坦丁地区发生了最严重的冲突。在最近24小时内，有46个阿尔及利亚人被打死，法国方面也有死伤。
    报纸说，由于当地居民同起义军队的团结一致，由于“阿尔及利亚战争”在法国士兵中极其不得人心，法国军队进行战斗活动越来越困难了。
