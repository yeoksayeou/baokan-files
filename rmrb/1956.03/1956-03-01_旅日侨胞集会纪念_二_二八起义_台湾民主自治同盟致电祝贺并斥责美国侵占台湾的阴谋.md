Xinhua News Agency, 28th - Tokyo News: Overseas Chinese in Japan held a meeting in Tokyo on February 28 to commemorate the ninth anniversary of the Taiwan people's "February 28 Uprising." The meeting was hosted by the Tokyo Overseas Chinese General Association. 500 overseas Chinese from Tokyo, Yokohama, and neighboring cities and towns attended the meeting.

Wu Puwen, Vice President of the Tokyo Overseas Chinese General Association, delivered the opening speech, saying: Since the "February 28 Uprising" in Taiwan, overseas Chinese in Japan have held commemorative meetings every year. The number of overseas Chinese participating in the meeting has increased year by year, and the level has become more and more extensive. This is a manifestation of the concern of overseas Chinese in Japan for the Taiwan compatriots in deep waters and is also a manifestation of patriotism.

Gan Wenfang, a member of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, also delivered a speech at the meeting. He said: Taiwan compatriots are rich in revolutionary tradition, and in the past, they gave a thorough blow to any aggressor and oppressor, including the Chiang Kai-shek clique. He said that he believed that Taiwan would be liberated in the near future. Overseas Chinese in Japan should unite, respond to Premier Zhou Enlai's call, promote patriotism, and contribute to the early liberation of Taiwan.

The meeting passed a resolution supporting Premier Zhou Enlai's political report at the Second Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The resolution stated: Taiwan is our country's sacred territory. We must liberate Taiwan. Liberating Taiwan is China's internal affair and brooks no interference from any third party. Taiwan compatriots are an inseparable part of the Chinese people. We must save Taiwan compatriots, and saving Taiwan compatriots is the supreme obligation of the Chinese people, fearing no threat from any third party. The resolution called on all patriotic overseas Chinese to unite more strongly, expand unity, and contribute everything to liberate Taiwan, save Taiwan compatriots, and defend world peace.

The resolution also stated that the Tokyo Overseas Chinese General Association responded to the motherland government's generous and sincere call to advise all compatriots controlled by the Chiang Kai-shek clique wandering in Japan to end their wandering life and get out of their delusion as soon as possible. "Those who want to stay in Japan temporarily, we will live together as brothers and sisters and seek the welfare of overseas Chinese together and unite and love the country. Those who want to return to the country, we are willing to use our best efforts to legally assist you to arrive safely in your sweet hometown."

Xinhua News Agency, 29th - The Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League sent a telegram to the overseas Chinese in Japan commemorating the ninth anniversary of the "February 28 Uprising."

The telegram said: Taiwan compatriots love the motherland. For many years, Taiwan compatriots have been engaged in a heroic struggle to return to the embrace of the motherland. Today, Taiwan is under the military rule of the United States, and Taiwan compatriots are still in deep waters. They cannot advance together with the people of the motherland, and the people of the motherland cannot but be very concerned about their fate.

The telegram said: The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan and will never stop until the goal is achieved. The telegram said: The Chinese people, including the Taiwan people, resolutely oppose the US-made conspiracy of Taiwan "independence" and resolutely oppose fallacies such as "trusteeship" of Taiwan and "referendum." The Chinese people resolutely condemn the traitor Liao Wenyi's traitorous act of establishing the so-called "Provisional Government of the Republic of Taiwan" with the support of the United States, because this is precisely the manifestation of the US-instigated conspiracy of "two Chinas."

    台湾民主自治同盟致电祝贺并斥责美国侵占台湾的阴谋
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：旅日侨胞2月28日在东京举行纪念台湾人民“二·二八起义”九周年大会。大会是由东京华侨总会主办的。参加大会的有东京、横滨以及邻近城乡的侨胞500人。
    东京华侨总会副会长吴普文致开会词说：自从台湾发生“二·二八起义”以后，旅日侨胞每年举行纪念大会，参加大会的侨胞一年比一年多，阶层越来越广泛，这是旅日侨胞对于在水深火热中的台湾同胞的关怀的表现，也是爱国主义的表现。
    中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会委员甘文芳也在大会上致词。他说：台湾同胞富于革命传统，过去对于任何侵略者和压迫者都给予彻底的打击，对蒋介石集团也不例外。他说，他相信在不久的将来一定能够解放台湾。旅日侨胞要团结起来，响应周恩来总理的号召，发挥爱国主义，为早日解放台湾贡献力量。
    大会通过决议支持周恩来总理在中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第二次全体会议上的政治报告。决议说：台湾是我国的神圣领土，我们一定要解放台湾，解放台湾是中国的内政，不容第三者任何的干涉。台湾同胞是中国人民不可分离的一部分，我们一定要拯救台湾同胞，拯救台湾同胞是中国人民的至上义务，不怕第三者任何的威胁。决议号召所有爱国侨胞更加坚强团结，扩大团结，把一切贡献给解放台湾，拯救台湾同胞，保卫世界和平。
    决议又说，东京华侨总会响应祖国政府的宽大热诚的号召，劝告所有徘徊在日本的被蒋介石集团控制的同胞，及早结束流浪生活，脱离迷途。“欲暂留日本者，我们手足共处，一块儿谋侨胞的福利，团结爱国。欲归国者，我们愿以最大的努力合法地协助你们安抵甜密的故乡。”
    新华社29日讯　台湾民主自治同盟打电报给旅日华侨纪念“二·二八起义”九周年大会。
    电报中说：台湾同胞是热爱祖国的。多年以来，台湾同胞一直在进行争取重回祖国怀抱的英雄斗争。今天，台湾受到美国的武力统治，台湾同胞还处在水深火热之中。他们不能够同祖国人民一起前进，祖国人民不能不十分关怀他们的命运。
    电报说：中国人民一定要解放台湾，不达目的，绝不休止。电报中说：中国人民包括台湾人民坚决反对美国制造的台湾“独立”的阴谋，坚决反对“托管”台湾、“公民投票”等谬论。中国人民坚决斥责汉奸廖文毅在美国支持下成立所谓“台湾共和国临时政府”的卖国行为，因为这正是美国策动的“两个中国”的阴谋的表现。
