    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 3rd. The socialist labor emulation campaign in Shanghai's industrial and commercial systems is surging continuously. The number of units and individuals participating in inter-factory and intra-trade competitions is increasing daily. According to incomplete statistics from the machinery, textile, light industry, municipal administration, and maritime transportation systems alone, as of February 27th, 382 units with 302,383 workers had participated in the competition.
    In this large-scale labor emulation campaign, a large number of new records are emerging every day. Yao Guoxiang, a model welder at the Shanghai Shipyard, has increased his welding efficiency by more than 95% above his quota; the group he leads completed its February task on February 18th. The assembly workshop of the Xinzhong Power Machine Factory used only 18 hours to assemble each gasoline engine in February, which is lower than the average planned target of 20 hours for the whole year; young worker Zhao Shunkang even created a record of 15 hours and 30 minutes. During this period, the number of rationalization proposals put forward by the workers greatly increased. According to the statistics of the state-owned Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, Turbine Factory, China Textile Machinery Factory, and five other factories in January, the workers put forward a total of 927 rationalization proposals, which is more than four times the average number of rationalization proposals received each month last year.
    In the upsurge of the competition, many vivid deeds of "the advanced leading the backward, and the advanced becoming even more advanced" have emerged. For example, the casting workshop of the China Textile Machinery Factory organized new and old workers into 19 mutual teaching and learning groups, with each skilled old worker leading one or two novices, setting off a wave of learning advanced technology throughout the workshop.
    This newspaper reports that workers in many factories, mines, and basic construction units in Shaanxi Province are actively participating in the socialist labor emulation campaign.
    Ten cotton textile factories in the province responded to the call of the Beijing State-owned No. 1 and No. 2 Cotton Textile Factories and participated in the national inter-factory competition among cotton textile factories. On the evening of February 7th, the day the competition started, the breakage rate of the fine yarn in Group B of the fine yarn workshop of the Shaanxi No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory decreased by 57%. Now, the quality of 21-count and 23-count fine yarn in this factory has all reached the first-class standard, and the percentage of first-class cotton cloth has reached more than 97%. Since the start of the competition, the workers of the sizing group of Group B of the preparation workshop of the Xinqin Textile Factory have continuously improved their skills. By February 10th, their sizing qualification rate had reached 100%, and the moisture content qualification rate had reached 91.3%. The number of blueprints printed by the Printing and Binding Section of the Xi'an Coal Mine Design Institute has increased from 1,000 to 1,500 per day. The output of the No. 3 Mine of Tongchuan Coal Mine has been continuously increasing in the competition. For example, Gao Zhicheng's team originally produced 50 carts of coal per day, now they have increased it to 90 carts.
    This newspaper reports that 164 factories and mines in Jinan, Qingdao, and Zibo in Shandong Province have participated in inter-factory and intra-trade competitions. In the competition, advanced deeds of improving technology and breaking quotas are constantly emerging. The workers in the dismantling workshop of the Jinan Locomotive Repair Factory solved the key problem of lifting the cylinder and removing screws, increasing efficiency by 32 times. The workers in the processing workshop of the Jinan Automobile Parts Factory created an unprecedented record of zero waste products for the entire month during the competition. Engineering and technical personnel of the Jinan Diesel Engine Factory put forward 111 rationalization proposals before the Spring Festival, of which 6, after being implemented, can save the country 80,000 yuan per year.
