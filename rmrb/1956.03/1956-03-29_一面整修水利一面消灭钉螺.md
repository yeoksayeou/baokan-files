    While repairing water conservancy projects, farmers in the Dongting Lake area of Hunan Province are using methods such as burning and burying with soil to eliminate Oncomelania hupensis, the intermediate host of schistosomiasis.
    The Zhu Jia Guai ditch in Caixing Township, Huarong County, is twelve li long, and snails are distributed in three li of the ditch. The maximum density is 192 snails per square meter, and the minimum is six. This time, in conjunction with the opening of the ditch, soil burial was used to eliminate snails, eliminating about 96%.
    The Hunan Provincial Department of Water Conservancy and the health department have preliminarily planned to do more than 130 million cubic meters of earthwork for dike and harbor projects in 1957, and will continue to eliminate snails in conjunction with water conservancy projects.

    湖南省洞庭湖滨农民在整修水利工程中采用火烧和土埋的方法消灭血吸虫的中间宿主——钉螺。
    华容县蔡兴乡朱家拐有一条十二里长的沟港，其中钉螺分布地段有三华里长，最多的每平方公尺有192个钉螺，少的也有六个。这次结合开港工程采用用土掩埋的方法来消灭钉螺，共计消灭了96％左右。
    湖南省水利厅和卫生部门初步计划在1957年做堤港工程一亿三千多万土方，将结合水利工程继续进行消灭钉螺的工作。　（新华社）
