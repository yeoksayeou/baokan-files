    Tianjin's agricultural and grain departments transported 1.06 million jin of the famous Xiaozhan rice's excellent seeds—Yinfang rice—to Beijing on the 13th, to supply farmers in the capital's suburbs for planting this spring. In the past three months, Tianjin has shipped more than 24 million jin of Yinfang rice seeds to Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Anhui, Guangdong, Fujian, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and other places. It is estimated that these seeds can be planted on more than 2.4 million mu of rice fields, with an output of more than 1.4 billion jin.
    Yinfang rice is the most common type of high-quality japonica rice in the suburbs of Tianjin. Last year, the average yield of this rice in various suburban areas was 715 jin of paddy rice per mu, and many high-yielding fields have reached more than 1,000 jin. The rice yield of this rice can be about 3% higher than that of ordinary indica rice, and the rice grains are full, crystal clear in color, and contain more protein and fat. Last year, the Tianjin Agricultural Department also donated a batch of high-quality Xiaozhan rice seeds to Hungary, Romania, and other people's democratic countries according to their requirements.
    According to the results of trial planting in Hubei and Sichuan provinces in 1955, it was proved that Tianjin's Yinfang rice is fully suitable for the climate in southern China. Under the same conditions, Yinfang rice matures more than 20 days earlier than the local indica rice, and the yield can be increased by about 200 jin per mu. (Xinhua News Agency)

    天津小站稻良种推广到国内外
    天津市农业和粮食部门在13日把106万斤著名小站稻的优良种籽——银坊稻——运往北京，供应首都郊区农民在今春栽种。近3个月来，天津市已输送了2，400多万斤银坊稻的种籽，分别供应给湖北、湖南、四川、安徽、广东、福建、陕西、山西等地。预计这些种籽能栽种水稻240多万亩，产量在14亿斤以上。
    银坊稻是天津市郊区最普遍的一种优良粳稻，去年各郊区这种水稻的平均产量为每亩715斤稻谷，许多丰产田已达千斤以上。这种稻谷的出米率可比一般籼稻多出约3％，而且米粒饱满、色泽晶莹，含有较多的蛋白和脂肪。去年天津市农业部门曾根据匈牙利、罗马尼亚等人民民主国家的要求，赠送他们一批小站稻的优良种籽。
    根据湖北、四川省在1955年试种的结果，证明天津的银坊稻完全适于我国南方的气候，在同等的条件下银坊稻比当地莹稻早熟20多天，每亩可增产200斤左右。　（新华社）
