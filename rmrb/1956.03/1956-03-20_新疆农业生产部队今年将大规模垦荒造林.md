The reclamation work in various reclamation areas of the Xinjiang Military Region Agricultural Production and Construction Corps has commenced in mid-to-late February. This year, more than 1.86 million mu of wasteland will be reclaimed for cultivation, representing 312% of the reclaimed area in 1955. The majority of the newly reclaimed land is distributed in the Manas River basin and the Kaidu River basin in southern Xinjiang, both of which are abundant in cotton and grain. The more than 800,000 mu of wasteland planned for reclamation in the Manas River basin will be entirely planned as state-owned farms mainly for cotton cultivation. This year, the Xinjiang Corps will use tractors for all land reclamation, with 380 standard tractors put into this work. The Xinjiang Water Conservancy Construction Corps will commence construction on 36 water conservancy projects of various sizes this year to ensure irrigation of the newly reclaimed land.

The Xinjiang Military Region Agricultural Production and Construction Corps will also begin constructing large-scale farmland shelterbelts at the end of this month and in April. This year, the afforestation area will reach 74,840 mu, more than three times the total afforestation area in the past few years. Currently, the land for afforestation in various reclamation areas has been leveled and tilled.

    新疆农业生产部队今年将大规模垦荒造林
    新疆军区农业生产建设部队各垦区已分别在二月中、下旬开始进行垦荒工作。今年内将开荒造田186万多亩，为1955年垦荒面积的312％。新垦荒地绝大部分分布在新疆盛产棉粮的玛纳斯河流域和南疆的开都河流域。计划在玛纳斯河流域开垦的八十多万亩荒地，将全部规划成以种植棉花为主的国营农场。今年，新疆部队全部使用拖拉机垦荒，有380标准台拖拉机投入这一工作。新疆水利建设部队，今年内将动工修建36项大小水利工程，以保证新垦荒地的灌溉。
    新疆军区农业生产建设部队在本月底和四月间还要开始营造大规模的农田防护林带。今年，营造的面积将达74，840亩，为过去几年来造林面积总和的三倍多。目前，各垦区造林的土地已进行了平整和翻耕。
