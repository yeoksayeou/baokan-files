    The British government has recently intensified its armed suppression of the Cypriot people and, on March 9, exiled Archbishop Makarios of Cyprus and other leaders of the Cypriot national liberation movement to the Seychelles. This act by the British colonialists has aroused strong protests from the Cypriot people, the Greek people, and freedom-loving people around the world, and has deepened the tense situation in that region.
    It should be pointed out that the repressive measures taken by Britain against the Cypriot people are also aimed at the national liberation movements of the people of various Middle Eastern countries. After the breakdown of negotiations between the British authorities and Archbishop Makarios, while threatening to "conduct a new full-scale campaign" against the Cypriot people, a spokesman for the British forces in Cyprus openly stated that British paratroopers in Cyprus were actively preparing so that they could fly to Amman or "any other troubled spot in the Middle East" at any time. At the same time, Washington also announced the dispatch of an additional battalion of Marines to the Mediterranean region. This situation shows that the imperialists are attempting to intervene by force in the affairs of Middle Eastern countries.
    The British colonialists regard Cyprus as a base for maintaining their colonial interests in the Middle East and for interfering in Middle Eastern countries. The current Governor of Cyprus, Harding, said when he was Chief of the Imperial General Staff: "Strategically speaking, Cyprus is a well-located air base, and it is also a place from which troops can be quickly mobilized in an emergency." British Secretary of State for Air Dudley, after a two-day inspection of Cyprus at the end of 1955, specifically pointed out that since the Baghdad Pact came into effect, Cyprus was "more important" to Britain as a base. British Prime Minister Eden, speaking in the House of Commons on the Cyprus issue on the 14th, undisguisedly said that Britain regarded Cyprus as a military base to "take care" of Britain's "interests in the Middle East—primarily oil."
    Precisely for this reason, Britain's policy toward Cyprus has always been to suppress and undermine the Cypriot people's movement for national self-determination in order to maintain its colonial rule over Cyprus. With the vigorous development of the national liberation movements of the Cypriot people and the people of various Middle Eastern countries, the British colonialists have redoubled their efforts to strengthen this base for colonial oppression in the Middle East and have intensified their suppression of the Cypriot people. In particular, since former Chief of the Imperial General Staff Harding took over as Governor of Cyprus in September 1955, Britain has continuously increased its troops on the island, imposed martial law, and taken the terroristic measures of banning the activities of the Progressive Party of the Working People of Cyprus and other democratic groups and arresting many prominent leaders of the Cypriot national liberation movement. Thus, on the island of Cyprus, with a population of only 500,000, the troops mobilized to suppress the residents numbered as many as 15,000, turning this picturesque island into a terrifying world full of barracks. The brutal behavior of the British army and police towards the residents was even considered "increasingly rough" by British Labour MP Crossman.
    While implementing brutal suppression, the British colonialists also put forward the so-called "Cyprus Autonomous Constitution," attempting to use this to deceive some people in order to alleviate the Cypriot people's movement for self-determination. This "Autonomous Constitution," which came from Harding's hand, only promised to grant the residents of Cyprus limited autonomy while continuing to maintain British colonial rule. Bevan, a left-wing leader of the British Labour Party, pointed out in a speech in the British House of Commons that the British proposals for Cyprus "are not genuine autonomy, but a fake." This method of using "autonomy" to whitewash and maintain colonial rule is of course unacceptable to the Cypriot people. During the negotiations between the British colonial authorities and Archbishop Makarios, the Cypriot people continuously held strikes and demonstrations to oppose this "Autonomous Constitution," demanding unconditional self-determination. Under the influence of the people's strong desire for self-determination, Archbishop Makarios rejected Harding's "Autonomous Constitution." In this way, the British colonialists' "autonomy" trick failed, and they revealed their true colors and took the measure of exiling Archbishop Makarios.
    While the British colonialists encountered resolute resistance in Cyprus, their situation in the Middle East also deteriorated. Britain continues to increase its troops in Cyprus to scare the people of the Middle Eastern countries, but the tide of the national liberation movements of the Middle Eastern people continues to rise. In particular, after the Jordanian people rejected the Baghdad Treaty that the British colonialists wanted to impose on them, they also achieved the victory of driving out the British General Glubb of the Jordanian Arab Legion, which was a significant blow to the British colonialists. Under these circumstances, the British colonialists wanted to strengthen their suppression of the Cypriot people in order to salvage their declining power in the Middle East, but this approach is obviously futile.
    The repressive measures of the British colonialists have made the Cypriot people more united. To protest the British colonialists' barbaric act of exiling Archbishop Makarios, the entire island of Cyprus held a general strike on March 10. The Mayor of Nicosia, Cyprus, Dervis, also issued a statement saying: "Whoever thinks that this dictatorial measure (referring to the exile of Makarios) can thwart the ardent desire for freedom of 400,000 Cypriot Greeks is greatly mistaken. The island's residents will continue to fight with unwavering conviction, regardless of all threats, and will not stop until national hopes are realized." The resolute actions of the Cypriot people have received the full support of the Greek people. Demonstrations against the British colonialists broke out throughout Greece. Facts show that the British colonialists' suppression actions not only cannot, as they hoped, "restore the rule of law" (that is, colonial order) in Cyprus, but on the contrary, can only make the Cypriot people more determined to fight for a complete liberation from British colonial rule.
    Similarly, it cannot help improve Britain's position in the Middle East. The attempt by British and American imperialism to intervene in the affairs of Middle Eastern countries by force has also been opposed by the Middle Eastern countries. The statement issued by the heads of state of Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia on March 12 clearly stated that they have drawn up a plan to counter this attempt, and specifically pointed out that the heads of state of the three countries have agreed that, in the event that Jordan is subjected to foreign pressure, they will provide Jordan with all possible support and assistance. Therefore, even some British bourgeois public opinion is worried that the British government's actions will only make the situation facing Britain in the Middle East worse.
    The Cyprus issue also shows the unjust nature of the North Atlantic Group and exposes the contradictions between the countries of the North Atlantic Group, especially the conflicts between Britain and Greece, and between Turkey and Greece. Now, Britain's arrogance has further deteriorated relations between the countries of the North Atlantic Group. The Greek government, under the emotional pressure of the people, has recalled the Greek Ambassador to Britain; the Greek delegation to the United Nations has issued a statement condemning British colonial policy and requesting that the Cyprus issue be included on the agenda of the next General Assembly. As the situation develops, contradictions between Britain and the United States have also emerged. In addition to expressing anxiety about the rise of the Cypriot and Middle Eastern people's movements, the United States also took the opportunity to intervene, expressing "sympathetic concern" to Greece and advocating the resumption of negotiations. This statement by the United States caused shock in London. Some British commentators pointed out that this action by the US ruling group was by no means out of sympathy for the national liberation movement, but rather to use this movement to seize some of Britain's colonial interests.
    Britain's barbaric repressive measures against the Cypriot people have once again clearly exposed the true face of the British colonialists. At the same time, it also proves once again that the fighting will of freedom-loving people cannot be thwarted by any means of suppression. Only by unconditionally recognizing the right of self-determination of the Cypriot people can the situation in that region be restored to calm. Any attempt to use force to save colonial rule, as the British "News Chronicle" pointed out, will not produce good results.

    应该承认塞浦路斯人民的自决权
    高集
    英国政府最近加紧了对塞浦路斯人民的武装镇压，并在3月9日把塞浦路斯大主教马卡里奥斯及塞浦路斯民族解放运动的其他领袖放逐到塞舌耳群岛，英国殖民者的这种行径，引起了塞浦路斯人民、希腊人民以及世界各国爱好自由人民的强烈抗议，并且加深了那个地区的紧张的局势。
    应当指出，英国对塞浦路斯人民所采取的镇压措施，同时也针对着中东各国人民的民族解放运动。英国当局在同马卡里奥斯大主教进行的谈判破裂之后，一面扬言要对塞浦路斯人民“进行一个新的全力的征讨”，一面塞浦路斯英国军队的发言人公然表示塞浦路斯的英国伞兵正在积极准备，以便可以随时飞到安曼或者“中东任何其他的多事地点”。与此同时，华盛顿方面也宣布增派一营海军陆战队到地中海地区。这种情形说明，帝国主义者正在企图武力干涉中东国家的事务。
    英国殖民者把塞浦路斯当作维护他在中东的殖民利益和对中东国家进行干涉的基地。现在的塞浦路斯总督哈定，在他担任英帝国参谋总长的时候就曾说过：“从战略上说，塞浦路斯是一个位置适宜的空军基地，而且也是一个在紧急情况下从那里迅速调动军队的地方。”英国政府空军大臣达德里1955年年底在对塞浦路斯进行了两天的视察之后，特别指出，自从巴格达军事集团条约生效以来，塞浦路斯对于英国作为一个基地来说是“更为重要了”。英国首相艾登14日在下院谈到塞浦路斯问题时，不加掩饰地说英国把塞浦路斯作为“照顾”英国在中东的“利益——首要是石油”的军事基地。
    正是因为这样，英国对塞浦路斯的政策从来就是镇压和破坏塞浦路斯人民要求民族自决的运动，以保持它对塞浦路斯的殖民统治。随着塞浦路斯人民和中东各国人民民族解放运动的蓬勃发展，英国殖民者更竭力加强他的这块对中东施行殖民压迫的基地，变本加厉地对塞浦路斯人民实行镇压。特别是从1955年9月前英帝国参谋总长哈定担任了塞浦路斯总督以来，英国更连续增调军队到岛上，实行戒严，并采取了禁止塞浦路斯劳动人民进步党和其他民主团体的活动以及逮捕塞浦路斯民族解放运动的许多著名领袖的恐怖措施。这样，在只有50万人口的塞浦路斯岛上，为镇压居民而调集的军队即达15，000人，使这个风景如画的海岛，变成了一个兵营林立的恐怖世界。英国的军队和警察对待居民的残酷行为，甚至连英国工党议员克罗斯曼也认为是“越来越粗暴了”。
    英国殖民者一面施行残酷的镇压，一面又提出所谓“塞浦路斯自治宪法”，企图借此来欺骗一些人，以缓和塞浦路斯人民要求自决的运动。这个出自哈定之手的“自治宪法”，只答应在继续保持英国殖民统治的情况下给予塞浦路斯居民以有限的自治权。英国工党左翼领袖比万在英国下院的发言中就指出，英国对塞浦路斯所提出的建议“不是真正的自治，而是冒牌货”。这种用“自治”来粉饰和维护殖民统治的办法当然是塞浦路斯人民所不能接受的。塞浦路斯人民在英国殖民当局同马卡里奥斯大主教进行谈判的过程中，曾不断举行罢工和示威，反对这个“自治宪法”，他们要求无条件的自决权。在人民要求自决的强烈情绪的影响下，马卡里奥斯大主教拒绝了哈定的“自治宪法”。这样，英国殖民者的“自治”骗术归于失败，他就露出本来面貌，采取了放逐马卡里奥斯大主教的措施。
    英国殖民者在塞浦路斯遭到坚决反抗的同时，它在中东的处境也日益恶化了。英国不断增兵塞浦路斯来吓唬中东各国人民，但是中东人民的民族解放运动的浪潮继续高涨。特别是约旦人民在拒绝了英国殖民者想强加在他们头上的巴格达条约之后，又取得了赶走约旦阿拉伯军团的英国将军格拉布的胜利，这对于英国殖民者是一个不小的打击。在这种情况下，英国殖民者想以加强对塞浦路斯人民的镇压，来挽回他在中东的没落的威势，但是，这种做法显然是无济于事的。
    英国殖民者的镇压措施，使塞浦路斯人民更加团结一致了。为了抗议英国殖民者放逐马卡里奥斯大主教的野蛮行径，塞浦路斯全岛在3月10日举行了大罢工。塞浦路斯首府尼科西亚市长德尔维斯并发表声明说：“谁要是以为这种独裁措施（指放逐马卡里奥斯）就可以锉折40万塞浦路斯希腊人热烈渴望自由的意志，那就大错特错了。岛上居民将不顾一切威胁，继续怀着毫不动摇的信念进行斗争，不到民族希望得到实现就决不停止。”塞浦路斯人民的坚决的行动，得到了希腊人民的全力支持。在希腊各地都爆发了反对英国殖民者的示威。事实显示，英国殖民者的镇压行动，不但不能如他们所期望的在塞浦路斯“恢复法治”（即殖民秩序），相反的它只能使塞浦路斯人民更加坚定地为彻底摆脱英国的殖民统治而斗争。
    同样的，它也不能有助于改善英国在中东的地位。英美帝国主义以武力干涉中东国家事务的企图，也遭到了中东国家的反对。埃及、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯三国首脑3月12日发表的声明中就明白表示，它们已拟定了一个计划，来反击这种企图，并且特别指出三国首脑已同意，万一约旦受到外国的压力，将给约旦以一切可能的支持和援助。因此，连一些英国资产阶级舆论也担心英国政府的做法只会使英国在中东所面临的情况更趋恶化。
    塞浦路斯问题还显示了北大西洋集团的非正义的性质，并且暴露了北大西洋集团国家之间的矛盾，特别是英国和希腊以及土耳其和希腊之间的冲突。现在，英国的蛮横行为使北大西洋集团国家之间的关系更加恶化。希腊政府在人民的激昂情绪下，已召回了希腊驻英大使；希腊驻联合国代表团并发表声明谴责英国的殖民政策，要求把塞浦路斯问题列入下届大会议程。随着事态的发展，在英国和美国之间的矛盾也显露出来了。美国除了对塞浦路斯和中东人民运动的高涨表示不安，还趁机干预，向希腊表示“同情的关怀”，并主张恢复谈判。美国的这个声明引起了伦敦的震动。一些英国的评论员指出，美国统治集团这一行动绝不是出于对民族解放运动的同情，而是想利用这个运动来夺取英国的某些殖民利益。
    英国对塞浦路斯人民的野蛮镇压措施，再一次清楚地暴露了英国殖民者的真面目。同时，它也再一次证明：爱好自由人民的斗争意志是任何镇压手段锉折不了的。只有无条件承认塞浦路斯人民的自决权利，才能使那个地区的局势恢复平静。任何想用武力来挽救殖民统治的企图，诚如英国“新闻纪事报”所指出的，是不会得到好结果的。
