Shanxi, Guangdong, Heilongjiang, Hunan, and Zhejiang provinces have recently held conferences of agricultural labor models and agricultural production increase activists.

At the Shanxi Provincial Conference of Activists in Socialist Construction in Rural Areas, the "Draft of the Shanxi Province 12-Year Agricultural Development Plan" and the agricultural production increase tasks for 1956 were discussed.

The key to completing the agricultural production increase tasks for 1956 is to run agricultural cooperatives well and to give full play to the superiority of advanced cooperatives. Therefore, the representatives present unanimously proposed to launch an "8 Comparisons" movement throughout the province, comparing production, technology, labor management, financial management, livestock management, culture, politics, and leadership.

At the First Guangdong Provincial Conference of Agricultural Labor Model Representatives, all labor models unanimously proposed to guarantee the resolute completion of the task of increasing grain production by 2.9 billion catties this year, and to strive to reach 4 billion to 5.9 billion catties. Efforts will be made to basically eliminate ordinary floods and droughts within the next two years.

At the Heilongjiang Provincial Conference of Agricultural Production Increase Activists, the head of Heilongjiang Province called for completing the target of 9 million tons of output for next year ahead of schedule this year, and striving to reach 10 million tons.

At the Third Hunan Provincial Congress of Model Workers in Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy, representatives from various regions exchanged experiences in achieving high yields and discussed the province's plans for agricultural production and cooperation this year. On the last day of the meeting, representatives from various regions launched a heated challenge competition.

At the Fourth Zhejiang Provincial Congress of Model Workers in Agriculture, Forestry, Animal Husbandry, and Fisheries, representatives exchanged more than 140 experiences in increasing production. At the meeting, the Shishannong, Xijiang, and Wudongzha agricultural cooperatives jointly responded to the production increase competition initiative of Li Shunda, a national agricultural labor model, and others; and proposed to agricultural, forestry, fishery, and animal husbandry production cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and farmers throughout the province to launch a provincial patriotic production increase competition.
