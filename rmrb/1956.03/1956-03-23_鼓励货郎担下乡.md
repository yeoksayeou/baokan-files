In Shitan Town, Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, the small vendors of cotton cloth and general merchandise originally had seven peddler's packs that regularly went to the countryside. After the cooperative store was organized in January this year, the work team responsible for transforming the small vendors adopted a method of paying fixed wages to all vendor members. The vendors felt that going to the countryside was more arduous, so they were unwilling to go to the countryside to sell goods. As a result, the store's turnover decreased by one-third. After persuasion and mobilization, although four peddler's packs were dispatched, everyone was still listless; later, a method of issuing subsidies for going to the countryside was stipulated, and three more peddler's packs were added, but the enthusiasm for operation was still not high.

Not long ago, based on the instructions of the Xiangtan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the work team, after studying the matter with the store affairs committee, adopted a payment method similar to piece-rate wages for the salesmen going to the countryside. At the same time, they conducted ideological education on supporting agricultural production by delivering goods to the countryside, and more people were willing to go to the countryside. The number of peddler's packs increased to eleven, and the turnover from sales in the countryside reached more than 40% of the store's total turnover.

This incident shows that when deciding on the wage form for small vendor members of cooperative stores, it is necessary to adapt to the characteristics of diverse business methods. Simply adopting a uniform fixed wage system will hinder the business enthusiasm of vendor members.

    鼓励货郎担下乡
    湖南湘潭县石潭镇的棉布、百货业小商贩，原来有七副经常下乡的货郎担。今年一月组织合作商店以后，由于改造小商贩的工作组对商贩成员采取了一律发给固定工资的办法，商贩们都认为下乡辛苦些，不愿下乡卖货了。店里的营业额因而下降了三分之一。经过说服动员，虽然出动了四副货郎担，但是大家仍然懒心懒意；后来又规定了下乡发给补助费的办法，又增加了三副货郎担，可是经营积极性仍然不高。
    不久以前，工作组根据中共湘潭地委的指示，经过店务委员会研究，对下乡推销员采取类似计件工资的支付办法，同时进行了送货下乡支援农业生产的思想教育，愿意下乡的人便多起来了。货郎担增加到十一副，下乡推销的营业额达到了全店总营业额的40％以上。
    这件事说明了：在决定合作商店的小商贩成员的工资形式的时候，必须适应多种多样经营方式的特点，简单地采取一律实行固定工资制的办法，是会妨碍商贩成员的经营积极性的。
