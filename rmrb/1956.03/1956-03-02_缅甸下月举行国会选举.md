Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 1st -- The President of the Union of Burma, Ba U, officially announced on February 29th the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies, effective from March 1st, and declared April 27th as the polling date for the general election.

This current Chamber of Deputies was established in March 1952. The Burmese Constitution stipulates that members of parliament serve a term of four years, after which elections are held.

According to the "Rangoon Daily," eight political parties will be competing for the 250 seats in the next Chamber of Deputies in this election. These eight parties include the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, the Burma National United Front, the Burma Nationalist Group, the Burma Democratic Party, as well as student groups and independents.

The opposition party, the Burma National United Front (including the Burma Workers and Peasants Party), wrote an open letter to Prime Minister U Nu on February 27th, suggesting the establishment of an all-party election commission to guarantee free and fair elections, and requested the government to negotiate with anti-government armed forces in order to cease the civil war.

    缅甸下月举行国会选举
    新华社仰光1日电　缅甸联邦总统巴宇已经在2月29日正式宣布从3月1日起解散国会代表院，并且宣布4月27日为普选的投票日期。
    本届代表院是在1952年3月成立的。缅甸宪法规定，议员任期4年，期满后进行选举。
    据“仰光日报”消息，在这次选举中，将有8个政党竞选下一届代表院的250个席位。这8个党派包括反法西斯人民自由同盟、缅甸国民统一战线、缅甸民族主义者集团、缅甸民主党，以及学生团体和无党派人士等。
    反对党缅甸国民统一战线（包括缅甸工农党在内）在2月27日写了一封公开信给总理吴努，建议成立一个各党派选举委员会来保证举行自由和公平的选举，并且要求政府同反政府的武装部队进行谈判，以便停止内战。
