　　Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 9th -- Dulles arrived in Delhi this afternoon with his tail between his legs. The Palam Airport was deserted, with neither garlands nor the enthusiastic crowds usually greeting distinguished guests. The hospitable Indians were evidently enraged by the aggressive arrogance of the resolutions passed by the Manila Treaty Organization council meeting, which closed yesterday. The only Indian government representatives meeting Dulles at the airport today were Deputy Minister of External Affairs Mahmud and a few officials. The rest were officials from the American embassy and some American expatriates, along with police holding batons, ready to maintain order.

　　In this desolate airport, the American Secretary of State gave a short speech. He repeatedly emphasized that “there are no fundamental contradictions or differences between the United States and India.” An Indian reporter asked him, “What do you have to say about Kashmir?” Dulles, saying “I’ll talk about it tomorrow,” hastily boarded his car and left.

　　The Press Trust of India, in reporting Dulles’s visit, said that political observers in Delhi considered that the time Dulles chose for his visit "could not be more inauspicious.” The Press Trust of India pointed out: “The statement on Kashmir in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization communique issued in Karachi last night has already aroused strong indignation here.”

    杜勒斯到德里
    新华社新德里9日电　杜勒斯今天下午灰溜溜地来到德里。巴兰机场冷清清地，既没有花环，也没有往常迎接贵宾的热情群众。好客的印度人显然是被昨天闭幕的马尼拉条约组织理事会的决议的侵略气焰激怒了。今天在机场接杜勒斯的印度政府代表只有外交部副部长马茂德和少数几个官员。剩下的只是美国大使馆的官员和一些美国侨民，再就是拿着木棍准备维持秩序的警察队伍。
    就在这样冷清清的机场上，这位美国国务卿发表了简短的谈话。他一再强调“美印两国之间没有基本的矛盾和不同”。一个印度记者问他“你对克什米尔是怎么说的？”杜勒斯一面说“明天再说”一面就急急忙忙登上汽车走了。
    印度报业托辣斯在报道杜勒斯来访的消息时说，德里的政治观察员们认为杜勒斯所选择的访问时间是“不能比这更不吉的”了。印度报业托辣斯指出：“昨天晚上在喀喇蚩发表的东南亚条约组织公报中关于克什米尔的声明已经引起这里强烈的愤慨。”
