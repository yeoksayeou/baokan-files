    This newspaper reports that the workers constructing the engine workshop, auxiliary workshop, and main warehouse of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant have overfulfilled this year's first quarter construction plan by 3.5% on March 9th, completing it 22 days ahead of schedule. The quality of the project is also good.

    During the construction process, the workers promoted various advanced experiences and actively sought to improve work efficiency. The Ding Zhiliang team improved the lifting tools, increasing the efficiency of roof panel hoisting by more than six times. Technicians proposed the use of "cold mortar" in winter construction, solving the difficulties of roofing work at low temperatures and ensuring the progress of construction. In earthwork projects, the use of large-scale mechanical compaction and automatic tamping machines increased work efficiency sevenfold.

    This newspaper reports that the equipment needed for the first workshops to be put into production at the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant has recently begun to arrive at the factory site in succession. Among these equipment are new-style equipment such as milling machines and grinders shipped in advance from the Soviet Union, as well as domestically manufactured lathes, Soviet-style drilling machines, and bridge cranes.

    The timely arrival of this batch of equipment will play a significant role in putting the tractor factory into production ahead of schedule. For example, the auxiliary workshop, which has just completed the external structure of the factory building, can install equipment as soon as the site is leveled and pipeline and other projects are completed, ensuring that production starts on time according to the plan to produce tractors ahead of schedule.

    第一拖拉机厂三项工程提前完成第一季度施工计划
    首批生产车间需用的设备已提前运到厂地
    本报讯　修建第一拖拉机制造厂发动机工场、辅助工场和总库房的职工们，已经在3月9日超额3.5％提前22天完成了今年第一季度的施工计划。工程质量也好。
    在施工过程中，职工们推广了各种先进经验，积极设法提高了工作效率。丁志良小组改进了吊装工具，使屋面板吊装效率提高了六倍多。技术人员在冬季施工中提出使用“冷沙浆”，解决了在低温下进行屋面工作的困难，保证了施工进度。在土方工程中，采用大型机械夯实和自动打夯机打夯的办法，使工作效率提高七倍。
    本报讯　第一拖拉机制造厂最先投入生产的车间需用的设备，最近开始陆续运到厂地。这些设备中有苏联提前运来的铣床和磨床等新式设备；有我国各地制造的车床、苏式钻床和桥式吊车等。
    这批设备的及时运到厂地，对于拖拉机厂提前投入生产将起重大作用。如刚完成厂房外形的辅助工场，只待场地平整完毕和完成管道等工程以后，就可安装设备，保证按照提前出产拖拉机的计划，及时开始生产。
