Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, March 24th: The Hebei Provincial People's Procuratorate recently decided not to prosecute four counter-revolutionaries who had confessed to their crimes, and gave them lenient treatment. The names of these four counter-revolutionaries are Yang Xiaozhou, Wang Huanan, Duan Wei, and Wang Rulong.

	Yang Xiaozhou, together with KMT secret agents Yang Yuzi and Yang Xiusheng, organized the Kuomintang Quyang County Party Department in Baoding City in February 1947. They successively dispatched Lu Bingxun and others to collect intelligence in Zhangjiakou, Kangbao, Dingxian, and Fushangtun in the liberated area west of Baoding, under the guise of doing business. Before the liberation of Baoding in 1948, Yang Xiaozhou fled to Beijing, and after formulating a plan for lurking with Yang Xiusheng and others, he returned to Baoding to carry out lurking activities. In 1950, after infiltrating the Baoding City Federation of Industry and Commerce, he also infiltrated the Hebei Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce. At this time, he secretly carried out activities such as organizing counter-revolutionary cliques, creating rumors, and inciting strikes. During the current struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries, he confessed to his historical crimes and current counter-revolutionary activities, and actively reported the crimes and whereabouts of more than thirty accomplices. According to the policy of leniency for confession and meritorious service to offset crimes, the Hebei Provincial People's Procuratorate decided not to prosecute. Yang Xiaozhou is now still working in his original unit.

	Wang Huanan joined the Military Intelligence Bureau (Juntong) special agent organization in 1947 and successively served as the head of the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League (Three People's Principles Youth League) and the Kuomintang District Party Department at Beiyang University. Before the liberation of Tianjin, he accepted instructions from his superiors to lie low and served as a group leader. His main crimes were: actively undermining the student movement in 1946; secretly reporting the list of Communist Party members and progressive teachers and students of Beiyang University to the special agent organization in the spring of 1948. After liberation, he prevented his accomplices from confessing and attempted to probe for intelligence. During the current struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries, he received education, confessed his problems, and expressed his willingness to turn over a new leaf. The Hebei Provincial People's Procuratorate believed that Wang Huanan had a good attitude towards confession and decided not to prosecute him. Wang Huanan remains in his original unit, retaining his original position and salary.

	Duan Wei joined the Kuomintang underground counter-revolutionary organization in Liaoyang in 1945. In 1950, he forged documents and infiltrated our China Medical University School of Pharmacy to study, and in 1954 he was assigned to the Hebei Provincial Pharmaceutical Company as an intern. His main crimes were: after joining the counter-revolutionary organization, he successively recruited five people in the liberated area to join the counter-revolutionary underground organization, and frequently probed our Liaoyang military and political intelligence to report to secret agents. In February 1946, he was responsible for keeping watch, allowing secret agent Zhang Yuzhi to assassinate a soldier of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Duan Wei also captured an underground worker with secret agent Liu Hui and others. During the current struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries, he proactively confessed his problems and reported fourteen counter-revolutionaries. The Hebei Provincial People's Procuratorate found the investigation to be true and decided not to prosecute. Duan Wei remains in his original unit, retaining his original position and salary.

	Wang Rulong, a Central Bureau of Statistics (Zhongtong) special agent, when he was at Fu Jen Catholic University before liberation, had successively secretly reported the names of six progressive students, including one Communist Party branch secretary and one Communist Party member, to two special agents. After liberation, he and his fellow special agents formed an alliance of offense and defense to resist registration. When he worked in the former North China Administrative Committee, he resisted leadership, attacked activists, and spread reactionary remarks after the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique were exposed. During the current struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries, Wang Rulong proactively confessed his crimes and reported more than 130 pieces of material on counter-revolutionaries. The Hebei Provincial People's Procuratorate believed that Wang Rulong had proactively confessed and made contributions, decided not to prosecute, and gave him material rewards. Wang Rulong remains in his original unit, retaining his original position and salary.

    坦白自首的反革命分子受到宽大处理
    新华社保定24日电　河北省人民检察院最近对已经坦白自己罪行的四名反革命分子，决定不向法院起诉，给予宽大处理。这四个反革命分子的名字是杨晓舟、王化南、段维、王如龙。
    杨晓舟在1947年2月和中统特务分子杨玉梓、杨修生在保定市组织国民党曲阳县县党部，先后派遣吕炳勋等多人，以作买卖为名来往张家口、康保、定县和保定以西我解放区富上屯一带搜集情报。1948年保定解放前夕，杨晓舟逃到北京，和杨修生等制定了潜伏计划以后，返回保定进行潜伏活动。1950年，他混入保定市工商业联合会以后，又混入到河北省工商业联合会。这时，他暗地进行组织反革命小集团、制造谣言、煽动怠工等活动。在这次肃清反革命分子斗争中，他把历史罪恶和现行的反革命活动事实作了交代，并且积极检举了同伙三十多个人的罪行和下落。河北省人民检察院根据坦白从宽、立功折罪的政策，决定不予起诉。现在，杨晓舟仍留原单位工作。
    王化南在1947年参加军统特务组织，历任北洋大学三青团和国民党区党部的负责人。天津解放前夕，他接受他上级的指示，潜伏下来，担任小组长。他的主要罪恶是：1946年积极破坏学生运动；1948年春，向特务组织密报了北洋大学共产党员和进步师生的名单。解放后，他阻止同伙交代问题，并且企图刺探情报。在这次肃清反革命分子的斗争中，他受到了教育，交代了自己的问题，表示愿意痛改前非。河北省人民检察院认为王化南坦白态度较好，决定不予以起诉。王化南仍留原单位工作，保持原职原薪。
    段维在1945年于辽阳参加国民党地下反革命组织，1950年，伪造证件混入我中国医科大学药学院求学，1954年分配到河北省医药公司担任实习生。他的主要罪恶是：参加反革命组织以后，在解放区先后发展五人加入反革命地下组织，经常刺探我辽阳军政情报向特务分子汇报。1946年2月他负责放哨，让特务分子张玉芝暗杀一名中国人民解放军战士。段维又和特务分子刘惠等捕捉我地下工作人员一名。在这次肃清反革命分子的斗争中，他主动地交代自己的问题，并检举出十四名反革命分子。河北省人民检察院侦查属实，决定不予起诉。段维仍留原单位工作，保持原职原薪。
    中统特务分子王如龙，解放前在辅仁大学的时候，曾先后向两个特务密报过六名进步学生的名单，其中有中共支部书记和共产党员各一人。解放后，他和同伙特务分子订立攻守同盟，抗拒登记。他在前华北行政委员会工作的时候，反抗领导，打击积极分子，胡风反革命集团罪行被揭发以后，散布反动言论。在这次肃清反革命分子的斗争中，王如龙主动交代了自己的罪行，并且检举出一百三十多件反革命分子的材料。河北省人民检察院认为王如龙主动坦白并立了功，决定不予起诉，还给以物质奖励。王如龙仍留原单位工作，保持原职原薪。
