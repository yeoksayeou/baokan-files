Communist Party Members and Revolutionary Cadres Should Not Engage in Exploitation

To the Editor:

Recently, our CPC Inner Mongolia Pingdi Quan Local Supervisory Committee conducted an investigation in Bazongying Township, Fengzhen County, regarding the implementation of Party discipline by rural Party members. We discovered that some Communist Party members and revolutionary cadres still had the erroneous behavior of exploiting peasants through land ownership.

During the land reform in this township in 1951, county and district cadres were still on the supply system, and their families faced financial difficulties. Therefore, these cadres, like the peasants, were allocated a share of land. Later, these cadres gradually enjoyed wage system benefits, and their living standards gradually improved. Their families also gradually moved to live with the cadres. However, they rented out or semi-cultivated all the land they had been allocated to the peasants. According to statistics from the end of last year, there were still 19 cadres in this township (many of whom were Communist Party members) who rented out or semi-cultivated 56 mu of irrigated land to 25 peasant households. These 19 cadres exploited more than 1,500 yuan from the peasants every year on average. As of mid-January this year, 18 cadres had neither returned this land to the peasants nor joined the cooperatives with it. It is understood that similar situations exist in various townships of Fengzhen County and other banners and counties in the Pingdi Quan area.

It should be asked of these Communist Party members and revolutionary cadres: on the one hand, you enjoy the wage system benefits of state employees, and on the other hand, you enjoy the fruits of exploitation from the peasants. Is this compatible with your ongoing work to eliminate exploitation and build socialism? Party organizations in the relevant areas should criticize and educate these Party members and cadres, and resolutely correct their capitalist ideology and exploitative behavior.

### 共产党员和革命干部不应当有剥削行为

    共产党员和革命干部不应当有剥削行为编辑同志：
    最近我们中共内蒙古平地泉地方监察委员会到丰镇县巴总营乡调查农村党员执行党纪的情况，发现有些共产党员和革命干部还有着用土地剥削农民的错误行为。
    1951年这个乡实行土地改革的时候，由于县、区干部还是供给制待遇，他们家属的生活比较困难，因此这些干部也都和农民一样分到了一份土地。以后，这些干部陆续享受了工资制待遇，生活水平逐步提高，他们的家属也都逐渐迁走同干部一起生活了。可是，他们把分来的土地全部出租或半种给农民了。据去年年底的统计，这个乡还有19个干部（其中有不少共产党员）的56亩水地出租和半种给25户农民。这19个干部平均每年要从农民身上剥削1，500多元。到今年1月中旬，还有18名干部既不将这些土地交还农民，也不把这些土地加入合作社。据了解，在丰镇县的各个乡和平地泉地区的其他旗、县也存在着类似的情况。
    应该责问这些共产党员和革命干部：你们一方面享受着国家工作人员的工资制待遇，另一方面又享受着从农民身上剥削来的果实，这和你们正在进行的为消灭剥削为建设社会主义的工作是相容的吗？有关地区的党组织应该对这些党员和干部进行批评和教育，坚决纠正他们的这种资本主义思想和剥削行为。　王步成
