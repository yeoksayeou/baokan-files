    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles delivered a speech on the American radio and television network on the evening of March 23rd, discussing his recently concluded trip to Asia.

    In his speech, he did not, as usual, boast about the achievements of his Asian tour. This unpopular visit to Asia forced Dulles to acknowledge in his speech that there are some "characteristics" in Asia now. He said that the people of Asian countries are proud of getting rid of foreign rule and are sensitive to any signs of external invasion.

    He said, "Another characteristic of Asia is the determination to develop the economic potential of this region. So far, productivity is low. People expect their new governments to improve their living conditions."

    In his speech, Dulles worriedly talked about the development of economic relations between the Soviet Union and China and Asian countries. He repeatedly harped on old tunes, trying to intimidate the Asian people with the so-called "international communist threat."

    However, Dulles also had to say: "Let us remember that while we are primarily concerned about the dangers from international communism, many of them (the people of Asian countries) are primarily concerned about the possible invasion of the West, because that is the rule they actually knew first."

    Dulles admitted that the people of Asian countries deeply hope for peace. "There is a strong desire for disarmament, especially because people feel that limiting armaments can save a sum of money, part of which can be used to help economically underdeveloped countries in the world." However, Dulles then said that the United States is "determined to maintain its strength."

    In his speech, when talking about the SEATO meeting in Karachi he attended, he advocated further developing the organization. He said that he visited some countries that have bilateral or multilateral treaties with the United States, and the United States "will help them develop their national armies." At the same time, he also advocated that the United States itself should maintain "the deterrent force of mobile military power."

    Dulles said that among the countries he visited, three countries—India, Ceylon, and Indonesia—were unwilling to participate in the United States' "regional security arrangements." Dulles said, "We also respect this choice." However, he also mentioned in his speech that he "found that some people in India are afraid that the arms we (the United States) give to Pakistan may be used against India."

    When talking about the Taiwan issue, Dulles reiterated the unreasonable claim of the United States to maintain the status quo of its armed occupation of Taiwan. He said that the United States insisted in the Geneva negotiations on "mutually renouncing the use of force, especially for this Taiwan area."

    Dulles spent a lot of time in his speech talking about the United States providing economic and technical "assistance" to Asian countries to "promote" the economic development of these countries. However, the specific content of the US plan he announced shows that the United States is not truly aiming at promoting the economic development of Asian countries.

    Dulles said in his speech: "The people of Asian countries hope that the West will recognize their dignity" and that the West should treat Asians with "a new attitude." However, despite the fact that he piled up a lot of nice words such as the so-called US "desire for peace" and "respect for national independence" in his speech in view of the strong opposition of the Asian people to American policy. The US policy towards Asia that he stated in this speech shows that the United States has not changed its policy of attempting to continue to dominate Asia through "strength."

### 杜勒斯发表演说谈他亚洲之行

    杜勒斯发表演说谈他亚洲之行
    据新华社讯　美国国务卿杜勒斯在三月二十三日晚上通过美国广播和电视网发表演说，谈他刚刚结束的亚洲之行。
    他在演说里没有像往常那样吹嘘他这次亚洲之行获得了什么成果。这次在亚洲的不受欢迎的访问使杜勒斯在演说里不得不承认，亚洲现在存在着一些“特征”。他说，亚洲各国人民对摆脱外国统治感到很自豪，对于外界入侵的任何迹象很敏感。
    他说，亚洲“另一个特征是发展这个地区的经济潜力的决心。到现在为止，生产力是低的。人民指望他们的新政府改进他们的生活情况。”
    杜勒斯在演说里担心地谈到苏联和中国同亚洲国家间经济关系的发展，他一再重弹老调，竭力企图以所谓“国际共产主义威胁”来恫吓亚洲人民。
    但是，杜勒斯也不得不说：“让我们记住，虽然我们首先想的是来自国际共产主义的危险，他们（亚洲各国人民）中许多人首先想的却是西方的可能侵入，因为那是他们实际上首先知道的法则”。
    杜勒斯承认，亚洲国家人民深切地希望和平。“那里有着一种很强烈的要求裁军的愿望，特别是因为人们感到限制军备以后就可以省出一笔款项，其中一部分将可以用来帮助世界上经济落后的国家。”但是，杜勒斯接着又说，美国“决心保持实力”。
    他在演说里谈到他参加的马尼拉条约组织喀喇蚩会议时，鼓吹要进一步发展这个组织。他说，他这次访问了一些同美国缔结了双边或者多边条约的国家，美国“将帮助它们发展它们的国家军队”。他同时又鼓吹美国自己要维持“机动军事力量的威慑力量”。
    杜勒斯说，在他这次访问的国家中有三个国家——印度、锡兰和印度尼西亚，不愿意参加美国的“区域性的安全安排”。杜勒斯说，“我们也尊重这种选择”。然而，他在演说里也谈到，他“发现印度有些人害怕我们（美国）给巴基斯坦的军火可能用来反对印度”。
    杜勒斯在谈到台湾问题时，又重申美国要保持它武装侵占台湾现状的无理主张，他说，美国在日内瓦谈判中坚持“彼此放弃使用武力，特别是对于这个台湾地区”。
    杜勒斯在演说里化了不少话来谈论美国要给予亚洲国家经济和技术“援助”，以“促进”这些国家的经济发展。但是，他所宣布的美国计划的具体内容，就表明美国并不是真正抱着促进亚洲国家经济发展的目的。
    杜勒斯在演说里说：“亚洲各国人民都希望西方认识他们的尊严”，西方要以“新态度来对待亚洲人”。但是，尽管他鉴于亚洲人民对美国政策的强烈反对，而在演说里堆砌了大量所谓美国“愿望和平”、“尊重民族独立”的好听话。他在这篇演说里申述的美国今后对亚洲的政策却表明，美国并没有改变它企图继续通过“实力”支配亚洲的政策。
