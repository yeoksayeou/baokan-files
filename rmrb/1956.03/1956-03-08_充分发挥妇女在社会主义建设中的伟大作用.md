    The socialist transformation has achieved a decisive victory in our country, and our country's social productive forces have been further liberated. What inevitably follows is a comprehensive and rapid development in the economy and culture. The main task now facing the entire Party and the people of the whole country is how to concentrate all forces and give full play to all potential to meet the needs of current production development. Here, correctly assessing and fully utilizing the strength of women is of extremely significant importance.
    From the perspective of women themselves, the process of building socialism is also the process of women's complete liberation. Only after eliminating the roots of class exploitation and poverty, and on the basis of fundamental changes in social technology and social customs, can true and complete equality between men and women be realized.
    Because the lofty goals of socialism are inextricably linked with the vital interests of women, the great cause of building socialism will inevitably strongly attract and inspire the broadest masses of women to engage in selfless labor. The Party's task in women's work is to inspire this socialist enthusiasm and to continuously improve and fully utilize this enthusiasm.
    In recent years, under the leadership and care of the Party and the government, the political and ideological awareness of women in our country has generally improved to varying degrees, and the unity and organization of women have been further expanded and consolidated. An increasing number of women have taken up social production, work, and study positions. Currently, the number of female workers nationwide has reached more than 2 million. Tens of millions of rural women are participating in agricultural and sideline production. In the ranks of intellectuals, the number of female staff members in science, culture, or technology is also gradually increasing. The families of the broad masses of workers, handicraftsmen, and private industrialists and businessmen, as well as other working women and housewives, are also increasingly enthusiastically serving the construction of the motherland directly or indirectly. Now, women from all walks of life are widely launching a surge to strive to be active participants and labor models in socialist construction. This surge will promote the faster advancement of our country's socialist construction.
    However, we must see that the labor potential hidden in the broad masses of women has not yet been fully utilized. Just taking the countryside as an example, our country has more than 200 million working women, and their labor force is about 120 million. What a huge labor army this is! If each female labor force contributes only 120 working days per year, that would be 14.4 billion working days a year! Chinese women are a great human resource. This resource must be tapped and fought for to build a great socialist country.
    Unfortunately, some of our cadres do not estimate the strength of women in this way. They more or less have feudal views and conservative ideas. They either think that women are inherently inferior to men and cannot accomplish great things even if mobilized, or they think that women are burdened by children and housework, have backward thinking, and are difficult to mobilize on a large scale, so they can only proceed slowly, and so on. Therefore, in their work, they do not adhere to the principle of mobilizing both men and women together, but rather underestimate, ignore, discriminate against, and exclude women. In rural areas, some agricultural cooperatives have not yet resolutely implemented the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women. Some raise women's labor quotas, lower labor work points, or simply regard women as semi-laborers. Some do not allocate appropriate jobs based on women's strengths and physiological characteristics, but require women to compete with men in physical strength and labor intensity, which affects women's health. Some people do not provide appropriate solutions to the problems of children and housework after women participate in production. In terms of training female cadres, there are also endless worries, thinking that "young girls will marry, middle-aged women have children, and older women are old. Only training male cadres is reliable." In some factories, mines, enterprises, institutions, and schools, there are also varying degrees and forms of discrimination or exclusion against women. For example, there are still not isolated phenomena of unwillingness to recruit women, discrimination against pregnant women, masters unwilling to teach female apprentices, and difficulties in not having anyone at home to take care of children not being resolved. These unreasonable phenomena all hinder the full utilization of women's strength and are not conducive to socialist construction, so they must be corrected.
    The far-reaching influence of long-term feudal traditions has made the political, cultural, technical, and health levels of women generally lower than those of men, and women themselves also have varying degrees of inferiority complex and dependency thinking. This is indeed still a common difficulty encountered in mobilizing women. However, this situation is completely changeable. How can we overcome difficulties and fully utilize the strength of women? Based on the experience of advanced regions, there are mainly four points:
    First, is to continuously educate all male and female citizens on the relationship between socialism and women's liberation. On the one hand, make women understand the consistency of the interests of the country, the collective, and the interests of women themselves, and understand their social responsibilities and the significance of actively participating in labor; on the other hand, make people from all walks of life regard the women's liberation movement as an inseparable part of the socialist revolution movement and jointly undertake it, consciously supporting and helping women to seek complete liberation along the socialist road. Only by using such political and ideological work to improve the awareness of men and women and to strengthen the unity of men and women can we guarantee the correct and full utilization of women's strength.
    Second, while carrying out political and ideological work, we must pay attention to solving women's personal problems and specific difficulties, such as heavy housework and childcare. The determination of the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women is the most important and most concrete measure. In the draft of the National Agricultural Development Program for 1956 to 1967 and in the draft model charter of agricultural cooperatives, it is clearly stipulated that this principle must be resolutely implemented. Facts have proved that through the implementation of the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women, it is easier for women to appreciate the superiority of the socialist system, love socialism more, and voluntarily contribute more and greater strength.
    Third, to build socialism and complete the revolution in production technology, there must be a large number of laborers with high cultural, scientific, and technical levels. To this end, strengthening women's production technology training has become an urgent task. To do this, we must help the majority of women in the country get rid of illiteracy and popularize natural science and maternal and child health knowledge in order to ensure that production quality is improved and the health of women and children is enhanced.
    Fourth, in order to encourage women's self-confidence, it is necessary to plan and consciously cultivate advanced figures among women, establish banners, and use real people and real things as examples to educate women, while further eliminating the remnants of "valuing men over women" in society. Excellent women should be selected into leadership organizations in a planned way. The existing thousands upon thousands of grassroots women cadres should be trained to help them improve their political level and working ability, so that they can lead the women to move forward.
    To do the above work well, the key lies in strengthening the Party committee's leadership over women's work. Party committees at all levels should incorporate women's work into the overall plans of various relevant departments and people's organizations so that they can cooperate with each other and complete the work together.
    Today is "March 8th" International Women's Day. In order to commemorate this festival more meaningfully, women in our country must more actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland and enhance the friendship and unity of women in our country with women in all countries. Only in this way can we most practically strengthen the power to defend peace in Asia and the world, and most practically fight for the rights and happy lives of women and children around the world.

### 充分发挥妇女在社会主义建设中的伟大作用

    充分发挥妇女在社会主义建设中的伟大作用
    社会主义改造事业在我国已经取得了决定性的胜利，我国的社会生产力获得了进一步的解放。随之而来的，必然是经济上和文化上的全面迅速的发展。现在摆在全党和全国人民面前的主要任务，是如何集中一切力量，发挥一切潜力，来满足当前生产发展的需要。在这里，正确估计和充分发挥妇女的力量，具有极其重大的意义。
    从妇女本身来说，建设社会主义的过程，也就是妇女彻底解放的过程。只有在消灭了阶级剥削和贫困的根源之后，在社会技术和社会风气得到根本改变的基础上，才能实现真正的完全的男女平等。
    由于社会主义的崇高目的和妇女的切身利益血肉相联，建设社会主义的伟大事业，就必然会强烈地吸引和鼓舞最广大的妇女群众去从事忘我的劳动。党在妇女工作方面的任务，就是去启发她们的这种社会主义积极性，并且不断地提高和充分地发挥这种积极性。
    近几年来，我国妇女在党和政府的领导和关怀下，政治思想觉悟在不同程度上普遍有了提高，妇女的团结和组织更加扩大和巩固了。日益众多的妇女走上了社会生产和工作、学习的岗位。现在全国女职工的人数已达200多万。农村妇女参加农业和副业生产的有几千万人。在知识分子队伍中，不论是科学、文化或技术方面，女性工作人员的数量也在逐渐增加。广大的职工、手工业者和私营工商业者的家属以及其他劳动妇女和家庭妇女，直接间接为祖国建设而热忱服务的也越来越多了。现在各阶层的妇女，正广泛地掀起一个争取做社会主义建设的积极分子和劳动模范的热潮。这个热潮将推动我国社会主义建设事业更快地前进。
    但是我们必须看到，蕴藏在广大妇女群众中的劳动潜力，还远没有得到充分的发挥。仅就农村说，我国有2亿以上的劳动妇女，她们中间的劳动力约有12，000万，这是多么巨大的一支劳动军！如果以每个妇女劳动力每年只做120个工作日计算，一年就有144亿个工作日！中国妇女是一种伟大的人力资源。必须发掘这种资源，为了建设一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。
    可惜，我们某些干部并不是这样来估计妇女的力量。他们或多或少地存在着封建观点和保守思想。他们或者认为妇女天生不如男子，发动起来也顶不了大事，或者认为妇女有孩子和家务的拖累，思想落后，很难大规模发动，只能慢慢来，等等。因此，他们在工作中就不是坚持男女一齐发动的方针，而是轻视、忽视、歧视和排斥妇女。在农村，有些农业合作社还没有坚决实行男女同工同酬的原则。它们有的是把妇女的劳动定额提高，劳动工分压低，或把妇女一律看成半劳动力。有的不根据妇女的特长和生理特点分配适当工作，而要求妇女和男子比体力，比劳动强度，以致影响妇女的健康。有的人对妇女参加生产以后的孩子、家务问题不作适当解决。在培养妇女干部方面，也有着无穷的忧虑，认为“年青姑娘要出嫁，中年妇女有娃娃，老年妇女年纪大。只有培养男干部靠得住”。在某些厂矿企业、机关、学校中，同样存在不同程度、不同形式的歧视或排斥妇女的现象，如不愿吸收妇女参加工作，歧视孕妇，师傅不愿教女徒弟，以及家中无人照顾孩子的困难得不到解决的现象，也还不是个别的。这些不合理的现象，都阻碍妇女力量的充分发挥，都不利于社会主义建设，因此必须加以纠正。
    长期封建传统所产生的深远影响，使妇女的政治、文化、技术以及健康水平一般低于男子，妇女自身也存在不同程度的自卑心理和依赖思想。这的确仍然是发动妇女中经常要遇到的困难。但是这种情况是完全可以改变的。如何才能克服困难，充分发挥妇女的力量呢？综合先进地区的经验，主要的不外四条：
    第一，是向全体男女公民不断地进行社会主义和妇女解放两者的相互关系的教育。一方面，使妇女懂得国家的、集体的利益和妇女自身利益的一致性，懂得自己的社会责任和积极参加劳动的意义；另一方面，使社会各阶层人民把妇女解放运动当作社会主义革命运动中不可分割的一部分而共同担当起来，自觉地支持和帮助妇女沿着社会主义道路求得彻底解放。也只有用这样的政治思想工作来提高男女人民的觉悟，来加强男女人民的团结，才能保证正确地充分地发挥妇女的力量。
    第二，在进行政治思想工作的同时，必须重视解决妇女的切身问题和具体困难，如繁重的家务和照管孩子等。男女同工同酬原则的确定，更是最重要、最具体的措施。在1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要草案中，在农业合作社的示范章程草案中，都明文规定必须坚决实行这个原则。事实证明，通过男女同工同酬的原则的实施，能够更容易地使妇女们体会社会主义制度的优越性，更加热爱社会主义，并自愿贡献出更多、更大的力量。
    第三，要建成社会主义，完成生产技术的革命，必须有大量的而且是具有高度文化、科学、技术水平的劳动者。为此，加强妇女的生产技术训练就成了迫切的任务。要这样，就必须帮助全国妇女中的大多数人脱离文盲状态，普及自然科学和妇婴卫生常识，才能保证提高生产质量，并增进妇女儿童的健康。
    第四，为了鼓舞妇女的自信心，必须有计划、有意识地在妇女群众中培养先进人物，树立旗帜，以真人真事作榜样教育妇女群众，同时进一步清除社会上“重男轻女”的思想残余。对妇女中的优秀分子，要有计划地选拔到领导机构中去。对已有的成千成万的基层妇女干部，要注意培养她们，帮助她们提高政治水平和工作能力，使她们带动妇女群众前进。
    要做好上述的工作，关键在于加强党委对妇女工作的领导。各级党委要将妇女工作分别纳入各有关部门和人民团体的全面规划中，以便由各方面互相配合，共同完成。
    今天是“三八”国际妇女节。为了更有意义地纪念这个节日，我国妇女必须更积极地参加祖国的社会主义建设，增进我国妇女同各国妇女的友谊和团结。只有这样，才是最实际地增强保卫亚洲和世界和平的力量，最实际地为全世界妇女儿童的权利和幸福生活而斗争。
