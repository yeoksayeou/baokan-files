Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 19th: When Indonesian President Sukarno returned to the capital, Jakarta, from Malang, East Java, on March 18th, approximately 100,000 workers, farmers, youths, women, and veterans held a demonstration at the airport to welcome him. The demonstrators carried placards and banners with slogans demanding the establishment of a democratic cabinet that was consistent with the results of the general election and capable of implementing a progressive program. These slogans said: "We disagree with the composition of the cabinet," "If the Masyumi Party participates in the cabinet, the Indonesian Communist Party should also participate," "If the Communist Party does not participate in the cabinet, the Masyumi Party should not be allowed to participate either," "The six million people who voted for the Indonesian Communist Party should not be ignored," "Long live democracy! Long live unity!"

The masses handed a resolution to Sukarno, requesting that he instruct the cabinet formateur to reconsider his cabinet formation work and to improve the cabinet's organizational composition to ensure the realization of a program beneficial to the Indonesian people and the Republic.

Sukarno told the demonstrators that since appointing the cabinet formateur, he had received many letters and telegrams from people all over Indonesia expressing their hopes for the cabinet formation work. During his tour of East Java, he had received many delegations sent by people from all walks of life, who also carried banners and placards similar to those at the airport and presented him with their petitions and resolutions. He was very pleased that the people were so concerned about the cabinet formation work. He said, "As the head of state, I will pay full attention to your wishes."

Prior to this, Sukarno said at a mass rally in Malang, East Java, on March 17th that he hoped for a strong cabinet that truly conformed to the results of the general election.

    印度尼西亚人民要求组成符合普选结果的民主内阁
    新华社雅加达19日讯　印度尼西亚总统苏加诺在三月十八日从东爪哇玛琅回到首都雅加达的时候，约有十万名工人、农民、青年、妇女和退伍军人在飞机场举行示威来欢迎他。示威者拿着标语牌和横旗，上面写着要求成立一个符合普选结果，能够执行进步纲领的民主的内阁的口号。这些口号说：“我们不同意内阁的组成成分”、“如果马斯友美党参加内阁，印度尼西亚共产党也就应该参加”、“如果共产党不参加内阁，也不应该让马斯友美党参加”、“不应该忽视投票支持印度尼西亚共产党的六百万人民”、“民主万岁！团结万岁！”。
    群众把决议交给苏加诺，要求他责成组阁人重新考虑他的组阁工作，并且要求改进内阁的组织成分，以保证实现对印度尼西亚人民和共和国有利的纲领。
    苏加诺对示威者说，他自从指派组阁人以来，已经收到印度尼西亚各地人民寄来的许多信件和电报，表示了他们对组阁工作的希望。他在巡视东爪哇期间，曾经接见了各阶层人民派遣的许多代表团，他们也拿着同飞机场上的人所拿的相似的横旗和标语牌，并且向他呈交了他们的请求书和决议。他对人民极其关心组阁工作感到很高兴。他说：“作为国家的元首，我将充分注意你们的愿望。”
    在这以前，苏加诺三月十七日曾在东爪哇玛琅的一次群众大会上说，他希望有一个真正符合于普选结果的强有力的内阁。
