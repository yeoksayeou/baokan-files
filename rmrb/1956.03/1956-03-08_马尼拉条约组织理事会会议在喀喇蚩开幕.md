Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, March 7th: The Manila Treaty Organization Council meeting opened in Karachi on March 6th. Delegations led by the foreign ministers of the eight countries participating in this military bloc—the United States, Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Thailand—are attending. The meeting is scheduled to last for three days.

    The public opening session on the morning of the 6th was chaired by Pakistani Foreign Minister Chaudhri.

    Pakistani Prime Minister Mohammed Ali delivered the opening speech. He spoke about the objectives of the Manila Treaty. He said, "As for Pakistan, I would like to take this opportunity to declare that under no circumstances will we participate in any act of aggression against any country, and therefore we will not in any way or form interfere in the internal affairs of any other country." He also said that it is of the utmost importance to take resolute steps to improve the living standards of the people in the backward countries of this region. The heads of the various delegations then made brief speeches.

    British Foreign Secretary Lloyd acknowledged in his speech that "there is a certain amount of widespread criticism in the world of military agreements and alliances," but he disregarded all the well-known facts and attempted to prove that the Manila military bloc is "a defensive organization" and that the establishment of such a military bloc is "fully in accordance with the United Nations Charter."

    French Foreign Minister Pineau then spoke. He believed that "improving the material and cultural living standards of the people is the best guarantee of political stability." Pineau also pointed out "the increasingly important role of the Asian continent in world economic and political affairs."

    U.S. Secretary of State Dulles spoke last at the opening session. He said that displaying "deterrent" power to counter the so-called "threat of communism" is the main purpose of the Manila Treaty Organization. He called on the countries participating in the Manila military bloc to "formulate common measures against Asian communism." In his speech, Dulles slandered the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and tried his best to tout the U.S. "military and economic assistance," which had long been recognized by the Asian public.

    Representatives from the Philippines, Thailand, New Zealand, and Australia also spoke.

    A closed-door meeting was held that afternoon. According to Western news agencies, Dulles spoke first at the meeting, continuing to promote the policy of strength and "deterrence." According to Agence France-Presse, Pineau, in response to Dulles's explanation of Soviet policy, said at the meeting that "coexistence is inevitable for a long period to come." Pineau also argued that Western countries should give the greatest importance to economic assistance and propaganda rather than to military measures.

    马尼拉条约组织理事会会议在喀喇蚩开幕
    新华社7日讯  喀喇蚩消息：马尼拉条约组织理事会会议3月6日在喀喇蚩开幕。参加的有美国、英国、法国、澳大利亚、新西兰、巴基斯坦、菲律宾和泰国八个参加这个军事集团的国家的外交部长所率领的代表团。会议预定举行3天。
    6日上午举行的公开的开幕会议由巴基斯坦外交部长乔德里担任主席。
    巴基斯坦总理穆罕默德·阿里致开幕词。他谈到了马尼拉条约的目的。他说：“至于巴基斯坦，我愿意借这个机会来宣布：我们在任何情况下也不会参加对任何国家的侵略行动，因此我们也不会以任何方式或形式来干涉任何别的国家的内政。”他还说应当急迫地采取坚决的步骤来提高这一地区的落后国家人民的生活水平，这是有最为重要的意义的。各国代表团团长随后作了简短的发言。
    英国外交大臣劳埃德在发言中承认“世界普遍地对军事协定和联盟进行了一定程度的抨击”，但是他不顾大家都知道的种种事实而企图证明，马尼拉军事集团是“一个防御组织”，而且建立这种军事集团还是“充分符合联合国宪章的”。
    法国外交部长比诺接着发言。他认为，“提高人民物质和文化生活水平是政治稳定的最好保障。”比诺并且指出了“亚洲大陆在世界的经济和政治事务中所起的日益重要的作用”。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯在开幕会议上最后发言。他说，为了反对所谓“共产主义的威胁”而显示“威慑”力量是马尼拉条约组织的主要目的。他要求参加马尼拉军事集团的国家“制定反对亚洲共产主义的共同措施”。杜勒斯在发言中诽谤苏联和中华人民共和国，并且竭力为早已被亚洲公众识破了的美国“军事和经济援助”吹嘘。
    菲律宾、泰国、新西兰和澳大利亚的代表也讲了话。
    当天下午举行了秘密会议。据西方通讯社透露，杜勒斯在会上首先发言，继续鼓吹实力“威慑”政策。据法新社报道，比诺在会上答复杜勒斯对苏联政策的说明的时候说，“在今后的长时期内共处是不可避免的”。比诺还主张西方国家对经济援助和宣传给予最大的重视而不是对军事措施给予最大的重视。
