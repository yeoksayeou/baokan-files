    Northern Section of Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Begins Definitive Survey Work
    The Sichuan-Guizhou Railway, originally scheduled to be built during the Second Five-Year Plan period, has been decided to be built ahead of schedule. Now, the definitive survey work for the 187-kilometer northern section from Ganshui Town to Zunyi has begun.
    The Sichuan-Guizhou Railway starts from Ganshui Town in Sichuan Province, passes through Zunyi, and reaches Guiyang City in Guizhou Province, with a total length of 340 kilometers. After the completion of this railway, it will play a significant role in developing the rich natural resources of the southwest region and promoting economic prosperity. (Chen Keyi)

    川黔铁路北段开始定测工作
    原定在第二个五年计划期间修建的川黔铁路已经决定提前修建。现在北段赶水镇到遵义的187公里的定测工作已经开始进行。
    川黔铁路从四川省的赶水镇起，经过遵义到贵州省的贵阳市，全长340公里。这条铁路建成后，对开发西南地区丰富的天然资源和繁荣经济将起重大作用。　（陈科义）
