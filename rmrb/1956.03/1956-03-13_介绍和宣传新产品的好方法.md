Good Ways to Introduce and Promote New Products
    By our reporter Xi Ping

    The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions has established a "Shanghai Industrial Production Achievement Exhibition Hall" in the Shanghai Workers' Cultural Palace. A "New Products Section" has been specially set up in the exhibition hall to regularly showcase the latest new products manufactured by various factories in Shanghai. This is an excellent way to expand the influence of new products in society. Everyone who comes to the Shanghai Workers' Cultural Palace makes sure to visit the New Products Section. According to statistics, more than 670,000 people visited between May and December last year.

    Among the one hundred and several dozen new products of all sizes displayed in the bright New Products Section, there are large new-type machine tools, small and various precision instruments, brightly colored new silk and wool fabrics, and various new daily necessities and cultural and educational supplies that have not yet been seen on the market. The most eye-catching are the various new machines. The latest product of the State-owned Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, the Model 345 multi-key shaft grinder, is displayed at the entrance. The parts manufactured by it generally have a tolerance of no more than one-thirtieth of a hair's breadth and are indispensable equipment for the automobile, tractor, aviation industries, and many other industrial sectors. Next to the new machine tools of the Machine Tool Plant are the universal milling machines, vertical milling machines, and horizontal milling machines manufactured by the Joint State-Private Hengxin Machinery Factory. These milling machines are manufactured according to the latest Czechoslovakian designs and are highly efficient and easy to operate. A 9,000-watt DC generator, last year's new product of the Shanghai Electric Motor Factory, is also on display in the New Products Section.

    The exhibition here includes the electric window opener manufactured by the Joint State-Private Shanghai Steel Window Factory, which can remotely control the airflow windows of large factory buildings from a distance of 80 meters. With the push of a button, many tall windows automatically open or close. This new type of electric window opener is now used in the large factory buildings of the Changchun First Automobile Factory. The Shanghai Industrial Experiment Institute of the Central Ministry of Light Industry, the State-owned Shanghai Electric Meter Factory, the Joint State-Private Xincheng Electric Appliance Factory, and other factories have exhibited here many automated controllers, recorders, measuring instruments, and other new instruments that play an important role in industrial production. These novel exhibits, which used to rely on imports, aroused great interest among the audience. A new type 9II-120 electronic temperature recording controller from the State-owned Shanghai Electric Meter Factory, installed on all high-temperature equipment in metallurgical plants, power stations, chemical plants, and other factories, can automatically record and control temperature increases and decreases, with a temperature measurement range of up to 1,600 degrees Celsius. The sunlight valve manufactured by the State-owned Shanghai Navigation Mark Factory can automatically control the acetylene flashing lights on waterways (a type of lighting equipment on waterways that uses acetylene gas as fuel), allowing the lights to automatically illuminate after sunset and automatically extinguish after sunrise.

    The exhibition also features various interesting new products with wide applications. The "Fireproof Sensor" of the Joint State-Private Zhendan Iron Factory is a "robot" that vigilantly guards the factory. When the temperature rapidly increases by more than 10 degrees Celsius, it automatically emits sound and light to alert people; when the temperature naturally increases and decreases with seasonal changes, it can automatically adjust; whether it is winter or summer, it is equally sensitive. The "Electric Master Clock" manufactured by International Telephone Factory can be installed in large factories or other large buildings. It connects hundreds of electric slave clocks, ensuring that everyone's time is accurate to within a second. The State-owned Shanghai Wired Radio Factory has manufactured a set of equipment for holding telephone conferences, which can simultaneously communicate with 60 telephone extensions.

    Shanghai's daily-use industrial products enjoy a high reputation in domestic and foreign markets. In recent years, Shanghai has manufactured many new products to meet the growing needs of the people. In the New Products Section, this aspect of the products has the most variety. Such as automatic record changer, four-use amplifier, colored glass, the latest style of bicycles and gold pens, recently trial-produced long three-needle luminous alarm clock, special five-color developer for color film and black and white film development, beautiful colored crepe paper that used to rely on imports, various new medicines and new textiles... These new products show the improvement of the living standards of our people and the high concern of our country for improving the material life of the people.

    The rich exhibits in the New Products Section of the Shanghai Workers' Cultural Palace not only allow visitors to see the high wisdom and creative talents of the liberated Shanghai working class, but also expand the social influence of new products and encourage workers' enthusiasm for trial-producing new products. Factories often regard it as a great honor to be able to publicly display their new products in the Cultural Palace. For example, the Joint State-Private Shanghai Zhiyun Electric Manufacturing Factory successfully trial-produced a new product called the woodworking electric drill in the fourth quarter of last year. When the New Products Section of the Workers' Cultural Palace asked them to send this new product to the Cultural Palace for exhibition, the workers completed the woodworking electric drill ahead of schedule.

    The New Products Section is especially welcomed by consumers and supply and marketing departments, promoting the connection between new product manufacturing enterprises and the masses. Many purchasing personnel from other places who rushed to Shanghai and local supply and marketing departments often come here to visit and understand the new varieties of products they need. Once, the New Products Section displayed many new specifications of tools and fixtures trial-produced by the Shanghai Tool Factory that had not yet been sold by the Shanghai Hardware Company. The staff of the Hardware Company saw it and directly contacted the Tool Factory to order them. Once, a purchasing department from Bengbu City sent people to Shanghai to purchase medical equipment. Before leaving, they visited the New Products Section of the Cultural Palace and discovered many new medical devices that they needed but could not find, so they re-contacted the relevant departments to purchase them.

    Many visitors have made suggestions for improving new products in the guestbook. These mass suggestions have great practical value for the production departments. Unfortunately, the Cultural Palace did not forward them to the factories. Even if some were forwarded, the factories were not seriously required to consider them.

    The role displayed by the New Products Section of the Shanghai Workers' Cultural Palace shows that it is very necessary to establish such a permanent specialized organization for publicly exhibiting new products in an industrial city to expand the social influence of new products. New products are new things that have emerged in our country's economic construction, and we must support them in many ways and promote them loudly so that they can grow faster. The comrades in charge of the New Products Section of the Shanghai Workers' Cultural Palace told me that at present, some factories and commercial departments are not good at using this specialized venue to promote the production and promotion of new products, and some factories even regard it as a troublesome thing. Some machine factories, woolen textile factories, and cotton cloth sales departments even ask the Workers' Cultural Palace for "depreciation and loss fees" for the exhibits. Last year alone, the Workers' Cultural Palace paid out more than 1,500 yuan in so-called various "depreciation and loss fees" from the workers' cultural and educational funds, which is an abnormal phenomenon. The comrades of the Workers' Cultural Palace also said: It is a very arduous organizational task to summarize the new products of thousands of factories in Shanghai, and it is even more difficult to promote and publicize them after they are summarized. The Workers' Cultural Palace is finding it very difficult to undertake this task and needs more care and support from the relevant leading departments in Shanghai.

    介绍和宣传新产品的好方法
    本报记者　习平
    上海市工会联合会在上海工人文化宫里，设立了一个“上海市工业生产成绩展览馆”，展览馆里专门辟了一个“新产品部”，经常集中展出上海各工厂最近制造出来的新产品。这是一个在社会上扩大新产品影响的很好的形式。凡是到上海工人文化宫里来的人，都要到新产品部来看一看。据统计，从去年5月到12月，已经有67万多人来参观。
    在新产品部明亮的室内陈列的一百数十种大大小小的新产品中，有庞大的新型工作母机，有体积很小的各种精密仪器，有色彩鲜艳的各式新的丝毛织物，有各种在市场上还没有见过的新的日用品和文教用品。最吸引人注目的要算各种新式机器。国营上海机床厂的最新产品345型多键轴磨床被陈列在入口处，用它制造出来的机件，公差一般不超过一根头发的三十分之一，是汽车、拖拉机、航空工业以及其他许多工业部门不可缺少的设备。跟机床厂新式工作母机并列着的，有公私合营恒新机器厂制造的万能铣床、立铣床、平铣床，这些铣床都是按照捷克斯洛伐克最新设计制造的，效率高、操作灵活。新产品部展出着一台9，000瓦的直流发电机，是上海电机厂去年的新产品。
    这里展出了公私合营上海钢窗厂制造的电动开窗机，可以远距离（80公尺）操纵大型厂房的气流窗，一按电钮，许多高大的窗子都自动地打开或者关闭。这种新式的电动开窗机，现在已经用到长春第一汽车厂的大型厂房中去了。中央轻工业部上海工业试验所、国营上海电表厂、公私合营新成电器厂等工厂在这里展出了许多对工业生产有重要作用的自动化的控制器、记录仪、测定计以及其他新式仪器。这些过去都是依靠进口的新奇的展品引起了观众极大的兴趣。国营上海电表厂新出的一种9Ⅱ—120型电子温度记录控制仪，装置在冶金厂、发电站、化工厂等工厂的一切高温设备上，可以自动记录和控制温度升降情况，测温范围最高可达摄氏1，600度。国营上海航标厂制造的日光阀能自动控制航道上的乙炔闪光灯（用乙炔气体作燃料的一种航道上的照明设备），能使灯光在日落后自动放光，日出后自动熄灭。
    展览会上还展出各种有广泛用途的有趣的新产品。公私合营震旦铁工厂的“防火感应器”，是一个警惕地守卫着工厂的“机器人”。温度急速增高摄氏10度以上的时候，它就自动发声发光，向人们报警；在季节变化温度升降自然增减的时候，它能自动调节；不论冬天夏天，它都一样的灵敏。国际电话厂制造的“电气母钟”，可以装置在大工厂或其他大厦内，它联系成百个电气子钟，使大家的时间不差一秒。国营上海有线电厂制造了一套召开电话会议用的设备，它可以同时和60个电话分机通话。
    上海市的日用工业品在国内外市场上享有很高的声誉。几年来，上海市制造了许多新产品，满足人民日益增长的需要。在新产品部里，这方面的产品花式最多。如自动落片电唱机、四用扩音机、五彩玻璃、最新式的自行车和金笔，最近试制成功的长三针夜光闹钟、专供五彩影片及黑白胶片显影用的五彩显影剂、过去一向仰赖进口的美丽的彩色绉纸、各种新药品和新纺织品……这些新产品，表明我国人民生活水平的提高和我们国家对于改善人民物质生活的高度关怀。
    上海工人文化宫新产品部的丰富展品，不但使参观者看到解放了的上海工人阶级的高度智慧和创造才能，并且扩大新产品的社会影响，鼓励工人们试制新产品的热情。工厂常常以能够把新产品在文化宫中公开展出引为莫大的荣誉。例如才公私合营的上海志云电业制造厂，在去年第四季度试制成功了一种名叫木工电钻的新产品，工人文化宫新产品部要他们把这种新产品送到文化宫展览，工人们就提前把木工电钻造好了。
    新产品部尤其受到消费者和供销部门的欢迎，促进了新产品制造企业同群众的联系。不少外地赶来上海的采购人员和当地供销部门，常常到这里来参观，了解自己所需要的新品种的产品。有一次，新产品部陈列了上海工具厂试制成功的许多新规格的连上海五金公司还没有出售的工夹具，五金公司的工作人员见了，就同工具厂直接联系订购。有一次蚌埠市的一个采购部门派来上海采购医疗器材的人，临走前参观了文化宫的新产品部，发现许多他们需要而找不到的新的医疗器械，就重新找有关部门购买。
    许多参观者在留言簿上提出了改进新产品的意见。这些群众建议对生产部门有很大的实际价值。可惜，文化宫没有把它转给工厂，有的虽然转去了，但是没有认真要求工厂考虑。
    上海市工人文化宫新产品部所显示的作用，说明在一个工业城市中，建立这样一个经常性的公开展出新产品的专门组织，来扩大新产品的社会影响，是很有必要的。新产品是我们国家经济建设中出现的新生事物，我们必须多方面给以扶植，大喊大叫地进行宣传，才能使它更快地成长起来。上海工人文化宫负责新产品部工作的同志告诉我，目前还有一部分工厂和商业部门不善于利用这个专门场所来推动新产品的生产和推广工作，有些工厂甚至把它看做是一件麻烦的事情。有些机器厂、毛纺织厂和棉布的销售部门还要向工人文化宫索取展出品的“折旧损耗费”。去年一年内，工人文化宫就从工人的文教经费中支付出所谓各种“折旧损耗费”达1，500多元，这是一种不正常的现象。工人文化宫的同志还说：把上海市数千个工厂的新产品汇总起来是一件十分繁重浩大的组织工作，汇总起来如何推广宣传就更加困难。工人文化宫担负这个任务是很吃力的，需要上海市有关领导部门给以更多的关心和支持。
