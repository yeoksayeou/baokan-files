Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 29th – In order to satisfy the demands of the audience, the Chinese Folk Art Troupe recently decided to extend the performance dates to March 4th.

　　In recent days, more and more people have been going to watch the performances of the art troupe. The line to buy tickets in front of the Macau Chinese General Chamber of Commerce is getting longer every day. As soon as the tickets for the day are sold out, people immediately wait to buy tickets for the next day. Many people bring small stools, and some even bring dry food and bedding to camp out at the ticket office while waiting to buy tickets. Many audience members have also written to the art troupe requesting an extension of the performance period. The letter from all the fishermen in Macau to the art troupe said: "If it weren't for the arrival of the art troupe, we would not be able to see such wonderful motherland art programs. The performance of our relatives makes the Macau compatriots so happy."

    澳门同胞要求中国民间艺术团延长演期
    新华社香港29日电　中国民间艺术团为了满足观众的要求，最近决定将演出日期延长到3月4日。
    连日来，前往观看艺术团演出的人愈来愈多。在澳门中华总商会门前购买入场券的队伍一天比一天长，当天的票刚刚售完，接着就有人守候着买第二天的票。很多人带着小板凳，有的还带着干粮、被褥露宿在售票处等候买票，许多观众还写信给艺术团要求延长演期。澳门全体渔民给艺术团的信说：“如果不是艺术团的到来，我们就无法看到这样美好的祖国艺术节目，亲人的演出使澳门同胞太高兴了。”
