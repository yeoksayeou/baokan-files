Zhejiang Province has comprehensively launched schistosomiasis prevention and control work. In the past two months, the province's health departments have trained more than 10,000 health workers and 378 stool managers for agricultural production cooperatives. 190,000 people have eliminated Oncomelania snails in an area of more than 3,402,000 square meters of land. More than one-third of the townships in the schistosomiasis epidemic areas of the province have implemented stool management.

In the work of eliminating schistosomiasis, the masses have created many new methods. For example, members of the Xingqiao Township Agricultural Cooperative in Hang County contract to eliminate Oncomelania snails by sections and record work points. In terms of treatment, in addition to using the Western medicine antimony preparations and the traditional Chinese medicine *Abelmoschus moschatus*, experimental treatment has also been carried out using more than 50 kinds of traditional Chinese medicines such as *Salvinia natans*, *Selaginella involvens*, *Dianthus chinensis*, and *Jingui Shizao Tang*.

    浙江开展血吸虫病防治工作
    浙江省全面开展了血吸虫病防治工作。近两个月来，省的卫生部门又给农业生产合作社训练了10，000多个保健员和378个粪便管理员。有19万人在占土地面积3，402，000多平方公尺的地区消灭了钉螺。全省血吸虫病流行地区有三分之一以上的乡实行了粪便管理。
    在消灭血吸虫病工作中，群众创造了许多新的办法。例如：杭县星桥乡农业合作社社员分段包工、记工消灭钉螺。在治疗方面，除用西药锑制剂、中药腹水草外，还试用浮胀草、岩柏草、瞿麦、金匮十枣汤等50多种中药进行实验治疗。（本报驻杭州记者）
