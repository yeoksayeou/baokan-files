Responses to Criticism and Suggestions

    Strengthening Leadership in Transportation Work

    Following the publication of the letter "Party and Government Leading Organs in Jinan Should Strengthen Leadership in Transportation Work" on the "Reader's Letters" page on February 14th, the Jinan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Jinan Municipal People's Committee have sent letters making self-criticisms. Currently, the Jinan Municipal Transportation Administration Bureau has 21 staff members. The Jinan Municipal Party Committee, with the approval of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, has also established a Transportation Department to strengthen leadership in transportation work.

    Actively Handling Backlogged Materials

    Letter from the Broadcasting Affairs Bureau: The criticism raised on the "Reader's Letters" page on October 16, 1955, regarding our bureau's blind procurement and backlog of a large number of equipment is entirely correct. Due to the lack of professional expertise among the relevant leaders of our bureau and the existence of supply system mentality, we have failed to establish reasonable consumption quotas and reserve quotas for a long time, resulting in the backlog of equipment. We have neither seriously dealt with the backlogged equipment nor properly maintained it, resulting in the waste of state property. Now, in addition to conducting widespread education among cadres and actively handling backlogged materials, we have also taken some active measures to improve radio station maintenance, improve management, and strengthen various systems.

    Letter from the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau's Automobile and Machine Tool Repair Plant: The criticism of our plant's backlog of rolling mills on the "Reader's Letters" page on January 8th is correct. We have now reported to the higher-level leading organs to transfer these machines for external use.

    Letter from the Liaoning Provincial First Construction Engineering Company: The letter "The Misfortune of 30,000 Bamboo Poles" on the "Reader's Letters" page on December 18, 1955, is correct in its criticism of us. In addition to selling more than 17,000 bamboo poles at reduced prices, we have also strengthened the storage of the remaining bamboo poles and are making every effort to use them in construction projects.

    Preventing Medical Malpractice

    Letter from the former Rehe Provincial First Hospital: The criticism raised on the "Reader's Letters" page on January 8th regarding the frequent medical malpractice incidents in our hospital's obstetrics and gynecology department is correct. We have organized doctors throughout the hospital to criticize this phenomenon and have given administrative punishments to those responsible for the incidents.

专栏：批评建议的反应

    批评建议的反应
    加强对交通运输工作的领导
    2月14日“读者来信专页”发表了“济南市党政领导机关应该加强对交通运输工作的领导”一信以后，中共济南市委会和济南市人民委员会已经来信作了检讨。现在，济南市交通运输管理局已经有了21名工作人员。中共济南市委也经中共山东省委批准，设立了交通运输部，以加强对交通运输工作的领导。
    积极处理积压物资
    广播事业局来信：1955年10月16日“读者来信专页”上对我局盲目采购和积压大量器材提出的批评，是十分正确的。由于我局有关领导人员钻研业务不够，并且存在着供给制思想，因而长期没有订出合理的消耗定额和储备定额，造成了器材积压的现象。对于积压的器材，我们既没有认真处理，又保管得不好，以致浪费了国家的财产。现在，我们除了在干部中普遍进行教育和积极处理积压物资以外，并且采取了一些积极的措施，改进电台维护工作，提高管理水平和加强各项制度。

    西北工程管理总局汽车机具修配厂来信：1月8日“读者来信专页”上对我厂积压轧钢机的批评是正确的。现在我们已报请上级领导机关把这些机器外调使用。

    辽宁省第一建筑工程公司来信：1955年12月18日“读者来信专页”上“三万根竹竿的厄运”一信对我们的批评是正确的。我们除了把17，000多根竹竿降价出售外，对其余的竹竿也已经加强保管工作，并且尽量使用到建筑工程中去。
    杜绝医疗事故
    原热河省立第一医院来信：1月8日“读者来信专页”上对我院妇科医疗事故频繁提出的批评是正确的。我们已经组织全院的医生对这种现象进行批判，并且已给事故的责任者以行政处分。

    1955年9月18日“读者来信专页”发表了“没有病治出了病”的批评信以后，原浩良河制材厂卫生所大夫姜渭增（现在已调到圣浪制材厂）已经受到记大过的处分。
