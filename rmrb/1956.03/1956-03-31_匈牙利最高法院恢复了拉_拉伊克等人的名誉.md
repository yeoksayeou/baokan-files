Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 30th: A meeting of activists of the Hungarian Working People's Party was held in Heves County on March 27th. The meeting discussed the educational significance of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the resolutions of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party held from March 12th to 13th.

    The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party, Rákosi, spoke at the meeting. When talking about the achievements of the Party's work, he said that one of the most important achievements was the strengthening of socialist legality. After exposing the imperialist agents Beria and Péter Gábor in Hungary, at the initiative of the leading organs of our Party, the Rajk case was re-examined (Editor's note: László Rajk successively served as the Minister of the Interior, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Secretary of the Budapest Party organization of the Hungarian Working People's Party in the Hungarian People's Republic. In September 1949, Rajk was falsely accused of being a foreign spy and engaging in treasonous activities and was sentenced to death; he was executed in October of the same year.), and the result was that the Rajk case was found to be based on instigation. Therefore, the Hungarian Supreme Court, in accordance with the resolution of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party in June of last year, rehabilitated Comrade László Rajk and other comrades. Other cases were also re-examined, and the reputations of innocent people who had been sentenced were restored, while others were granted amnesty. The cases of former Social Democrats who had been sentenced were also re-examined. Most of these people have been released, and the last batch will be released in these days. Those who are innocent will have their reputations restored, and those who have made mistakes against our people's democratic system will also be pardoned.

    Rákosi said that the powerful determination shown by the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the issue of the cult of personality is a solemn manifestation of the Party's strength and confidence and a source of new achievements and new victories. However, this has not stopped the enemy from attempting to use the resolutions of the 20th Congress and the struggle against the cult of personality to confuse the working masses' understanding of this issue. We encounter such attempts in our country anytime, anywhere. Our task is to immediately and sharply expose and thwart all attempts by the enemy to cause confusion.

    匈牙利最高法院恢复了拉·拉伊克等人的名誉
    新华社布拉格30日电　布达佩斯消息：三月二十七日，赫威斯州举行了匈牙利劳动人民党积极分子会议。会上讨论了苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的教育意义和匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会三月十二日至十三日举行的全体会议的决议。
    匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会第一书记拉科西在会上讲了话。他在谈到党的工作成绩的时候说，最重要的成绩之一是社会主义法制的加强。在揭露了帝国主义代理人贝利亚和匈牙利的彼得·高伯尔之后，在我们党的领导机构的倡议下，重新审查了拉伊克案件（编者按：拉伊克曾经先后任匈牙利人民共和国内政部长、外交部长和匈牙利劳动人民党布达佩斯党组织的书记。1949年9月，拉伊克被诬告为外国间谍、从事叛国活动而被判处死刑；同年十月被处决。），结果认定拉伊克案是建立在挑拨的基础上的。因此，匈牙利最高法院根据匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会去年六月全体会议的决议恢复了拉·拉伊克同志及其他同志的名誉。同样也重新审查了其他一些案件，恢复了无辜被判刑的人们的名誉，对其他的人则实行了大赦。还重新审查了过去的社会民主党人被判刑的案件，这些人大多数被释放了，最后一批在这几天内就将释放。他们当中凡是无罪的便恢复名誉，凡是对我们人民民主制度犯过过错的也得到赦免。
    拉科西说，苏联共产党第二十次代表大会在个人崇拜问题上所表现的有力的坚定性，是党的力量和信心的庄严表现，是新成就和新胜利的源泉。然而这并没有制止敌人企图利用第二十次代表大会的决议和反对个人崇拜的斗争来混淆劳动群众对这个问题的认识。在我国随时随地都会碰到这种企图。我们的任务是立即尖锐地揭露和挫败敌人引起混乱的一切企图。
