    More than 20 newly built and expanded granular fertilizer plants in Jiangsu Province have been put into production one after another. These factories are distributed on the transportation lines in the suburbs of cities such as Nanjing, Suzhou, and Wuxi, making it very convenient to use urban garbage as raw materials.

    These factories can produce 250 million catties of granular fertilizer a year.
