Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, March 18th: The Hungarian people are tensely fighting against the Danube River flood. According to a statement from the Hungarian government's flood prevention committee, in southern Hungary, the Danube River flood breached a several-kilometer-long section of the levee, causing widespread flooding. Currently, intensive flood prevention work is underway along the Danube River. Approximately 40,000 people, using 2,500 trucks, hundreds of excavators, and other machines, are battling the flood day and night. Thanks to the measures taken by the flood prevention committee, a 350-kilometer-long section of the Danube River bank (the Danube River is 450 kilometers long within Hungary) has been protected from breaches due to the impact of the flood and ice.

When the levee broke in southern Hungary, dozens of villages, parts of the cities of Baja and Szekszárd, and Mohács Island, not far from the Hungarian-Yugoslav border, were flooded.

On the recommendation of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party, the Hungarian Council of Ministers has allocated 25 million forints (Hungarian currency) to immediately provide relief to the disaster-stricken refugees.

    匈牙利人民和多瑙河洪水紧张进行斗争
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利人民正在和多瑙河的洪水进行紧张的斗争。据匈牙利政府防汛委员会通告说，在匈牙利南部，多瑙河洪水冲破了几公里长的一段堤坝，泛滥成灾。现在，多瑙河沿线展开了紧张的防汛工作，约有4万人使用着2，500辆载重汽车、几百部挖泥机和其他机器在日夜不停地同洪水进行搏斗。由于防汛委员会采取了措施，保住了长达350公里的多瑙河堤岸（多瑙河在匈牙利境内共长450公里），使其没有因洪水和冰块的冲击而破堤。
    在匈牙利南部堤防决口时，有几十个村庄、巴亚和谢克萨德两个城市的一部分以及离匈牙利和南斯拉夫边界不远的莫哈赤岛都被水淹了。
    根据匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会的建议，匈牙利部长会议已经拨款2，500万福林（匈币名）立刻救济受灾难民。
