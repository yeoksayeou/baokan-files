    Unite Private Practicing Doctors to Prevent and Treat Schistosomiasis

    Schistosomiasis is prevalent in the Suzhou Special District, located in the heart of the Taihu Lake basin. Many people are infected, and relying solely on the limited medical personnel of schistosomiasis prevention and treatment institutions for treatment is impossible. Therefore, involving private practicing medical workers in the fight to eliminate schistosomiasis has become an important issue.
    The Suzhou Special District has more than 4,600 traditional Chinese medicine doctors, 700 Western medicine doctors, and nearly 600 nurses and laboratory personnel. However, schistosomiasis prevention and treatment personnel in the special district have long held the idea of underestimating private practicing doctors and have not paid attention to leveraging their role. Some areas even excluded private practicing doctors from participating in prevention and treatment work. Later, the Suzhou Special District Schistosomiasis Prevention and Treatment Center once entrusted some private practicing doctors to treat schistosomiasis patients under the name of "entrusted groups." Private practicing doctors, focusing solely on completing tasks, also failed to exert their enthusiasm.
    According to a survey by the Suzhou Special District Schistosomiasis Prevention and Treatment Center, approximately two-thirds of the private practicing doctors in the entire district are distributed in schistosomiasis-endemic areas. Most of them have experience in treating schistosomiasis and maintain regular contact with the masses. From 1953 to 1955, the Suzhou Special District mobilized 70% of the private practicing doctors, and they treated 54.6% of the total number of schistosomiasis patients in the district. This made everyone deeply aware that only by leveraging the strength of private practicing doctors can schistosomiasis be completely eliminated. Therefore, under the further mobilization and organization of the schistosomiasis prevention and treatment stations, many private practicing doctors participated in the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis and provided many effective prescriptions for the early elimination of schistosomiasis.
    Under the unified leadership of the local health administrative departments, the Suzhou Special District, through the Health Workers Association, mobilized private practicing doctors to organize joint clinics to participate in the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis. A total of 356 joint clinics of traditional Chinese and Western medicine were organized throughout the district. Those capable of providing treatment independently were assisted by the government in establishing 478 beds to receive patients for long-term treatment. For those with poorer conditions, the prevention and treatment stations assisted them in organizing schistosomiasis treatment groups by drawing personnel from several joint clinics. For those lacking medical equipment, they were proactively supplied with necessary equipment.
    In order to mobilize private practicing doctors to participate in the treatment of schistosomiasis, the Suzhou Special District also took various measures to train private practicing doctors to master the treatment techniques for schistosomiasis. First, the special district and the schistosomiasis prevention and treatment centers and stations in each county held professional training courses, respectively, and absorbed 168 people from joint clinics and private practicing doctors to participate in professional training courses; second, 133 private practicing doctors, as well as laboratory and nursing personnel, were absorbed to participate in clinical practice in hospitals or schistosomiasis prevention and treatment stations. After these people underwent practical training, most of them were able to work independently; third, prevention and treatment centers and stations exchanged cadres with the prevention and treatment groups of joint clinics and signed teaching contracts with each other, conducting mutual teaching and learning in actual work to train private practicing doctors; fourth, prevention and treatment centers and stations regularly held professional meetings attended by the heads of joint clinics to exchange experiences in treating schistosomiasis. Through the above series of work, many joint clinics that were originally unable to treat schistosomiasis are now able to treat independently, and the work of preventing and treating schistosomiasis has greatly developed. In Wuxi County, none of the two thousand three hundred schistosomiasis patients treated by private practicing doctors in 1954 and 1955 died.
    Since November 1955, the Suzhou Special District Schistosomiasis Prevention and Treatment Center has also held meetings of representatives of traditional Chinese and Western medicine doctors and various small-scale symposiums to exchange and summarize the methods and experiences of traditional Chinese medicine and Chinese herbal medicine in treating schistosomiasis. Recently, the specialist hospital of the Suzhou Special District Schistosomiasis Prevention and Treatment Center established a traditional Chinese medicine group, and each county has also successively established central groups for traditional Chinese medicine treatment of schistosomiasis, coordinating with Western medicine to widely conduct experiments on the application of Chinese herbal medicine in treating schistosomiasis, and has already achieved great results. From the more than one thousand three hundred schistosomiasis patients treated with Chinese herbal medicine in various parts of the Suzhou Special District, it has been proven that there are many kinds of Chinese herbal medicines that can treat early, middle, and late-stage schistosomiasis. The enormous effect of traditional Chinese medicine and Chinese herbal medicine in treating schistosomiasis has powerfully criticized the erroneous thinking that schistosomiasis "has no effective medicine." The schistosomiasis prevention and treatment workers in the Suzhou Special District have worked hard to unearth many folk prescriptions, greatly increasing their confidence in eliminating schistosomiasis at an early date. The schistosomiasis prevention and treatment workers in the Suzhou Special District are determined to strive to eliminate schistosomiasis in four years or less.

    团结私人开业医生防治血吸虫病
    史越峨
    在太湖流域中心的苏州专区，普遍流行着血吸虫病。得病的人很多，光靠血吸虫病防治机构的少数医疗人员来治疗，是不可能的。因此，吸收私人开业的医务工作者，参加消灭血吸虫病的斗争，就成了重要的问题。
    苏州专区有中医四千六百多人，西医七百人，护士、化验人员近六百人。可是，专区血吸虫病防治工作人员过去长期存在着轻视私人开业医生的思想，没有注意发挥他们的作用。有些地区甚至排斥私人开业医生参加防治工作。后来，苏州专区血吸虫病防治所曾用“委托组”的名义，委托部分私人开业医生治疗血吸虫病人，私人开业医生从单纯任务观点出发去完成任务，也没有发挥他们的积极性。
    根据苏州专区血吸虫病防治所的调查，全专区约有三分之二的私人开业医生分布在血吸虫病流行地区，他们大部分有治疗血吸虫病的经验，和群众保持着经常的联系。从1953年到1955年，苏州专区动员了私人开业医生中70％的力量，他们所治疗的血吸虫病人占专区治疗总数的54.6％，这使大家深刻地认识到，只有发挥私人开业医生的力量，才能彻底消灭血吸虫病。于是在血吸虫病防治站的进一步动员和组织之下，许多私人开业医生参加了血吸虫病的防治工作，并且为提早消灭血吸虫病提供了很多有效的药方。
    苏州专区在当地卫生行政部门的统一领导下，通过卫生工作者协会、发动私人开业医生组织联合诊所参加血吸虫病的防治工作。全区共组织了356个中西医联合诊所，能单独进行治疗的，由政府帮助他们设立了478张病床，长期接受病人进行治疗；条件较差的，在防治站的协助下，由几个联合诊所各抽调人员组织血吸虫病治疗组进行治疗；医疗器材不足的，主动地供给他们必要的器材设备。
    为了动员私人开业医生参加血吸虫病的治疗工作，苏州专区还采取各种办法培养训练私人开业医生掌握血吸虫病的治疗技术。第一，专区和各县血吸虫病防治所、站分别举办专业训练班，分批吸收联合诊所和私人开业医生168人参加专业训练班学习；第二、吸收133名私人开业医生以及化验、护理人员参加医院或血吸虫病防治站的临床实习，这些人经过实习，大多数已能单独工作；第三、防治所、站同联合诊所的防治组交换干部，互相签订教学合同，在实际工作中进行互教互学来培养私人开业医生；第四、由防治所、站定期召开有联合诊所负责人参加的专业会议，交流治疗血吸虫病的经验。通过以上一系列的工作，很多原来不能治疗血吸虫病的联合诊所现在已能单独治疗，防治血吸虫病的工作有了很大的发展。无锡县1954年和1955年由私人开业医生治疗的二千三百个血吸虫病人，没有发生一个死亡。
    1955年11月以来，苏州专区血吸虫病防治所还召开了中西医代表会议和各种小型座谈会，交流和总结中医中药治疗血吸虫病的方法和经验。最近，苏州专区血吸虫病防治所专科医院成立了中医组，各县也先后成立了中医治疗血吸虫病的中心组，配合西医广泛进行应用中药治疗血吸虫病的试验，已经取得很大成绩。从苏州专区各地使用中药治疗的一千三百多个血吸虫病人中，证明有很多种中药可以治疗早期、中期和晚期的血吸虫病。中医中药治疗血吸虫病的巨大效果，有力地批判了那些认为血吸虫病“治无良药”的错误思想。苏州专区血吸虫病防治工作人员努力发掘了许多民间药方，大大提高了对早日消灭血吸虫病的信心。苏州专区的血吸虫病防治工作者，决心争取在四年或者更短的时期内消灭血吸虫病。
