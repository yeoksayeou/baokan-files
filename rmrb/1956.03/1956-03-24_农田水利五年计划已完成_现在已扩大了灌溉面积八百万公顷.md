Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd - China's plan for farmland water conservancy construction during the first Five-Year Plan has been overfulfilled. The original national plan was to expand the irrigated area of farmland by 4.8 million hectares in five years, but it has now been expanded by 8 million hectares.

    The large-scale movement to build farmland water conservancy projects only developed after the upsurge of agricultural cooperation. From October 1955 to early March 1956, the irrigated area expanded by 5.2 million hectares. Now, the total irrigated area of farmland in the country has increased to more than 30 million hectares, accounting for more than a quarter of the country's farmland area. Farmers in many areas have reported that the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), which proposed to basically eliminate ordinary water and drought disasters within seven to twelve years, may be achieved ahead of schedule. Farmers in Henan, Shandong, and Hunan plan to eliminate ordinary drought disasters in about five years.

    After organizing a large number of agricultural producers' cooperatives, farmers had sufficient labor to build farmland water conservancy projects that individual farmers were unable to undertake in the past. When farmers established pumping stations, small hydropower stations, and other projects, the government also provided technical and economic assistance as much as possible.

    According to a survey by the Ministry of Water Resources, farmland can generally increase unit area yield by 30% to 50% after being irrigated, and even more in arid areas.

### 农田水利五年计划已完成  现在已扩大了灌溉面积八百万公顷

    农田水利五年计划已完成
    现在已扩大了灌溉面积八百万公顷
    新华社23日讯　我国第一个五年计划期间兴修农田水利的计划已经超额完成。国家原计划在五年内扩大农田灌溉面积四百八十万公顷，现在已扩大了八百万公顷。
    大规模兴修农田水利的运动是在农业合作化高潮出现以后才发展起来的。从1955年10月到1956年3月上旬，各地扩大的灌溉面积即达五百二十万公顷。现在，全国农田灌溉面积已增加到三千多万公顷，占全国农田面积的四分之一以上。许多地区的农民反映，全国农业发展纲要（草案）提出的要在七年到十二年内基本上消灭普通水、旱灾的计划，可能争取提早完成。河南、山东、湖南的农民计划在五年左右就消灭普通旱灾。
    在组织了大量的农业生产合作社以后，农民有了足够的劳动力兴修以前个体农民所无力举办的农田水利工程。在农民建立抽水机站、小型水力发电站及其他工程的时候，政府在技术上和经济上也尽可能地给予帮助。
    据水利部的调查，农田得到灌溉以后，一般能增加单位面积产量30％到50％，在干旱地区，增产更多。
