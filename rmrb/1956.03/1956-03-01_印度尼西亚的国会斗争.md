Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 29th: The Indonesian Parliament held a meeting on the evening of February 28th.

	The parliamentary session began with a debate on the agenda. Acheim and Suryono Hardjinoto of the Indonesian Nationalist Party's parliamentary faction suggested that the meeting should first discuss the motion of no confidence in the Harahap Cabinet.

	Sakirman, leader of the Indonesian Communist Party's parliamentary faction, seconded the proposal by Acheim and others. He called on all Indonesian people and democratic parties to work to abolish the Round Table Conference Agreement, saying that this should be the task of the new cabinet formed based on the results of the parliamentary elections.

	Speakers from the Masjumi Party's parliamentary faction and other ruling parties insisted that the draft bills submitted by the Harahap Cabinet must be discussed first. This proposal was passed by a majority vote.

	As it was already late, the Speaker of the Parliament, Sadono (belonging to the Nationalist Party), suggested postponing the debate on the bills until the next morning. However, the ruling parties again insisted that the bill should be discussed immediately at this meeting. Sadono criticized this attitude of the government parties and announced his resignation as Speaker of the Parliament. Katawenaata of the Indonesian Islamic League Party also immediately resigned as Deputy Speaker of the Parliament. Before the government's proposed bill was discussed, all members of the Indonesian Nationalist Party, the Indonesian Communist Party, the Indonesian Islamic Teachers Association, the Indonesian Islamic League Party, the Perti Islamic Party, and the Progressive Party factions withdrew from the meeting.

	The draft bills submitted by the Harahap Cabinet were hastily passed at 1 a.m. on February 29th by the members of Parliament who remained, mainly from the ruling parties.

    印度尼西亚的国会斗争
    据新华社雅加达29日电　印度尼西亚国会在2月28日晚上举行了会议。
    国会会议首先就议程问题进行辩论，印度尼西亚国民党国会党团的阿黑姆和苏约诺·哈丁诺托建议会议首先讨论对哈拉哈普内阁的不信任案。
    印度尼西亚共产党国会党团领袖萨基尔曼附议阿黑姆等的建议。他号召所有印度尼西亚人民和民主政党为废除圆桌会议协定而努力，他说这应当是根据国会选举结果成立的新内阁的任务。
    马斯友美党国会党团和其他执政党的发言者坚持主张必须首先讨论哈拉哈普内阁提出的法案草案，这个建议以多数票获得通过。
    由于时间已经很晚，国会议长沙多诺（属于国民党）建议延期到第二天上午就法案进行辩论。但是，执政党再度坚持这个法案应当在这次会议上立刻进行讨论。沙多诺指责政府党派的这种态度，并且宣布辞去国会议长的职务。印度尼西亚回教联盟党的卡塔韦纳塔也立即辞去国会副议长的职务。在讨论政府提出的法案以前，印度尼西亚国民党、印度尼西亚共产党、印度尼西亚回教师联合会、印度尼西亚回教联盟党、白尔蒂回教党和进步党党团的全体议员都退出了会场。
    哈拉哈普内阁提出的法案草案在2月29日清晨1时，由留在国会中的主要是执政党派的议员匆匆通过。
