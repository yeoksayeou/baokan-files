An Agricultural Cooperative in the Ailao Mountains of Yunnan

    If you travel northwest from Xinping County, Yunnan Province, for two days and cross the Honghe River, you will reach the foot of the Ailao Mountains. Clouds float around the waist of the Ailao Mountains, making it difficult to see the main peak, which is 70 miles high. We walked through countless mountain roads in the forest before reaching the summit of the Ailao Mountains. Here, the weather cleared up, and herds of cattle and sheep were scattered across a grassland. From afar, you could hear the sound of bells on the livestock's necks and the calls of cattle and sheep. These are the cattle and sheep of the Gotoupo Production Cooperative, established in November 1954.
    Gotoupo Village is inhabited by 13 minority peasant households. A little over a decade ago, this was still a desolate, untouched mountain. In 1945, 13 minority peasant households from Maoni Township, Xinping County, unable to endure the persecution of the Kuomintang reactionaries and the exploitation of landlords, moved to this primeval forest above the clouds to escape disaster. However, poverty followed them. The total income of the 13 households was not enough for three months of food and they could only survive by eating wild vegetables. Girls of seventeen or eighteen could not afford clothes and could only wear sacks. These painful days did not end until the local liberation. In 1953, the year of the land reform, four households rose to the level of middle peasants, and the nine poor peasant households also obtained land. Hardship and suffering gave these 13 peasant households the habit of unity and mutual assistance. After land reform, they organized mutual aid teams. Three people from the village joined the Communist Party, and five joined the New Democratic Youth League. By 1953, seven households had enough grain to eat, and the rest were only short two or three months' worth. However, collective labor and decentralized management in the mutual aid teams still resulted in a great waste of manpower and resources.
    In the winter of 1954, after representatives of these 13 peasant households visited advanced agricultural production cooperatives, they voluntarily organized a cooperative. In addition to private vegetable plots and a small number of livestock, the 13 households contributed a total of 137 mu of land, 539 sheep, and 18 cattle to the cooperative. From then on, a new page was turned in the production of Gotoupo.
    Over the past year, the cooperative's production has greatly developed. After unified grazing of cattle and sheep, the cooperative saved more than 1,000 workdays, and the mortality rate of livestock also decreased by 40%. More than ten mu of land that were cultivated last year were fertilized. In order to resist the encroachment of wild animals, the cooperative also organized a hunting team and built sheds in the fields near the primeval forest, guarded by cooperative members with weaker labor power. Last year, the amount of grain damaged by wild animals was only 60 jin, a 90% decrease compared to 1954. Since its establishment, the cooperative has suffered two unprecedented natural disasters. In May of last year, a hailstorm caused the loss of more than 75% of the cooperative's crops. Under the leadership of the Party branch, the cooperative replanted all the disaster-stricken land within three days, resulting in not only no reduction in production but also an increase of 22%. Last year, agricultural and pastoral production increased by a total of 36.9% compared to 1954.
    As their lives improved, they also wanted to achieve cultural liberation. Last year, they built a primary school themselves and hired a teacher. All the children in the village are now in school. Some cooperative members said: "We have never been to school in generations. With Chairman Mao's leadership, our children can go to school!"
    In order to further develop mountain production, the Gotoupo Agricultural Production Cooperative has carried out a comprehensive plan. They want to concentrate the cultivated areas to facilitate field management and prevent animal damage. They plan to expand the area of cultivated land by another 30 mu this year. In addition, they also plan to plant tea trees, walnut trees, and other trees. In terms of animal husbandry, they will also promote improved breeds.

    云南哀牢山上的一个农业合作社
    屈永泰
    从云南省新平县往西北走两天，跨过红河便到了哀牢山下。云层在哀牢山腰间浮动，使人很难看见这70里高的哀牢山主峰。我们走过了不知道多少森林间的山路，才到了哀牢山的峰顶。在这里，天气晴朗起来了一片草场上，散布着成群的牛羊。老远就可以听到牲畜脖子上铃铛的响声和牛羊的叫声。这就是1954年11月间建立的狗头坡生产合作社的牛羊。
    狗头坡村住着13户少数民族农民。十几年前，这里还是人迹罕到的原始荒山。1945年，新平县帽泥乡的13户少数民族农民因为经受不住国民党反动派的迫害和地主的剥削，才迁到这云层上的原始森林里躲避灾难。但是，贫困追赶着他们。13户的全部收入，还不够三个月的口粮，只能靠吃野菜度日；十七八岁的姑娘也穿不上衣服，只能披个麻袋片片。痛苦的日子，直到当地解放的时候才结束。1953年土地改革的当年，就有四户上升为中农，九户贫农也都有了土地。灾难和痛苦使这13户农民有了团结和互助的习惯。土地改革以后，他们就组织了互助组。全村有三个人参加了共产党，五个人参加了新民主主义青年团。到1953年，有七户粮食已经够吃，其余的只差两三个月的口粮。但是互助组里集体劳动，分散经营，人力、物力还有很大浪费。
    1954年冬天，这13户农民的代表参观了先进的农业生产合作社以后，就自动地组织了合作社。13户农民除了自留菜园地和一小部分牲畜外，共入社土地137亩，羊539只，牛18头。从此，狗头坡的生产开始了新的一页。
    一年多来，这个社的生产有了很大的发展。牛羊统一放牧以后，全社节省了1，000多个工，牲畜的死亡率也降低了40％。去年定耕的十多亩地都施了肥。为了抵抗野兽的侵害，社里还组织了一个打猎队，同时在靠原始森林的田地里搭了棚子，由劳动力弱的社员看守地里的庄稼。去年受野兽损害的粮食，只有60斤，比1954年减少90％。这个合作社成立以来，曾经遭到了两次空前的自然灾害。去年5月间，一场冰雹，全社庄稼损失了75％以上，在党小组的领导下，全社三天内抢种了全部的受灾土地，结果不仅没有减产，还增产22％。去年农业、牧业，比1954年共增产36.9％。
    生活上改善了，他们还要在文化上翻身。去年他们自己盖了一所小学校，请了一位教师。村里的孩子都入学了。有的社员说：“我们多少辈子没有读过书，有了毛主席的领导，娃娃也能上学了！”
    狗头坡农业生产合作社为了进一步发展山区生产，已经进行了全面规划。他们要把耕作区集中起来，以便进行田间管理，防止兽害；他们计划在今年再扩大定耕土地30亩；此外，还准备种植茶树、核桃等树木。在牧业方面，也要推广优良品种。
