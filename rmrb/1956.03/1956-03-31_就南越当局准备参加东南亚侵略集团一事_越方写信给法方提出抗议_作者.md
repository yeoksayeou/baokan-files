Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 30th. The delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army to the Vietnam Central Joint Ceasefire Commission sent a letter to the delegation of the General Command of the French Federal Forces on March 23rd, protesting the South Vietnamese authorities' preparation to join the Southeast Asia aggression bloc.

The letter pointed out that the United States and South Vietnam have already formed a de facto military alliance and are intensifying their efforts to pull South Vietnam into the Southeast Asia aggression bloc. This situation has not only not stopped, but has become increasingly serious.

The letter listed the following facts: South Vietnam's Foreign Minister Vu Van Mau announced at a press conference held in Saigon on March 7th that South Vietnam hopes to join the Southeast Asia military alliance. On March 8th, Vu Van Mau also sent the suggestions of the so-called elected representatives in the South Vietnamese fake National Assembly to the meeting of Southeast Asia Treaty Organization countries held in Karachi. This suggestion announced the denial of the Geneva Accords and the final declaration of the Geneva Conference.

The delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army pointed out that the purpose of these conspiracies and actions is to undermine Article 19 of the Vietnam Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities and Article 5 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference; it threatens the peace of Vietnam and creates tension in Vietnam.

The delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army requested the General Command of the French Federal Forces to take all necessary measures to stop the above-mentioned conspiracies of the South Vietnamese authorities.

    就南越当局准备参加东南亚侵略集团一事
    越方写信给法方提出抗议
    新华社河内30日讯　越南人民军总司令部驻越南中央联合停战委员会代表团在三月二十三日写信给法兰西联邦部队总司令部代表团，对南越当局准备加入东南亚侵略集团一事提出抗议。
    这封信指出，美国和南越已经在实际上结成了军事联盟，并且正在加紧设法把南越拉入东南亚侵略集团。这种情况非但没有停止，而且日益严重。
    信件列举了以下事实：南越当局的外交部长武文牡三月七日在西贡举行的记者招待会上曾经宣布，南越希望参加东南亚军事联盟。武文牡在三月八日又把南越冒牌国会中的所谓当选代表的建议寄给东南亚条约组织国家在喀喇蚩召开的会议。这个建议宣布否认日内瓦协定和日内瓦会议的最后宣言。
    越南人民军总司令部代表团指出，这些阴谋和行动的目的在于破坏越南停止敌对行动协定第十九条和日内瓦会议最后宣言第五条；它威胁越南的和平，并且造成越南的紧张局势。
    越南人民军总司令部代表团要求法兰西联邦部队总司令部采取一切必要措施来制止南越当局的上述阴谋。
