Garrison troops in the capital participate in voluntary labor

    To the south of Yuyuantan in the western suburbs of Beijing, a new river channel has appeared, 1,200 meters long and 22 meters wide. This is a section of the Yongding River water diversion project, dug by generals, officers, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing through voluntary labor. When the Yongding River Water Diversion Project Headquarters inspected the work, they found the quality to be good.

    The officers and soldiers encouraged themselves to actively work with the slogan "Heroes on the front lines of defending the motherland, models in the posts of building the motherland." They set up tents at the construction site, and every morning the start time was about an hour earlier than the scheduled time. They completed 94,485 cubic meters of earthwork in eighteen days of labor, saving the state more than 70,000 yuan. On seven suburban Beijing highways, including Beijing-Tongxian and Deshengmen-Qinghe Town, many officers and soldiers also participated in voluntary tree planting labor. (Xinhua News Agency)

    首都驻军参加义务劳动
    北京西郊玉渊潭南面，新出现了一条长达一千二百多公尺、宽二十二公尺的河道。这是永定河引水工程的一段，是中国人民解放军驻京部队的将军、军官和士兵们用义务劳动挖成的。永定河引水工程指挥部验收的时候，认为质量良好。
    官兵们都以“在保卫祖国的战线上是英雄，在建设祖国的岗位上是模范”的口号鼓舞着自己积极劳动。他们在工地上搭起帐篷，每天清早开工时间都比规定时间提前约一小时。他们用十八天的劳动完成了94，485土方的工程，为国家节约了七万多元。在北京—通县、德胜门—清河镇等七条北京郊区的公路上，也有许多官兵参加了植树的义务劳动。（新华社）
