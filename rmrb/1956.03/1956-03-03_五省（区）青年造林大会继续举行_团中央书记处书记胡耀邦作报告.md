Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd. The Five Province (District) Youth Afforestation Conference continued in the afternoon of the 2nd. Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, delivered a report at the meeting entitled "Youths! Take on the Task of Greening the Motherland."

In his report, Hu Yaobang pointed out the importance of greening our great motherland. While explaining his report, Hu Yaobang put forward four requirements and six methods for young people across the country to carry out afforestation activities. The four requirements are what the Party Central Committee instructed in its congratulatory message to the conference: "Not only to build quickly, but also to build well; not only to plant a lot, but also to plant alive; not only to plant trees, but also to cultivate seedlings; not only to afforest, but also to protect forests." The six methods are: First, formulate afforestation plans and implement planned afforestation; second, seize the afforestation season and implement shock afforestation; third, widely establish nurseries and do a good job in basic construction; fourth, learn afforestation techniques and improve afforestation quality; fifth, carry out forest protection activities to ensure forest safety; sixth, implement a reward system to promote an afforestation upsurge.

Hu Yaobang then pointed out that planting trees and afforestation is the most important and effective measure to maintain soil and water. Maintaining the soil and water on the Loess Plateau is the fundamental key to implementing the great plan to fundamentally control the Yellow River's water hazards and develop the Yellow River's water conservancy. Therefore, greening the Loess Plateau and doing a good job in soil and water conservation on the plateau is an arduous, long-term, and glorious task for all young people in the five provinces (districts).

Hu Yaobang concluded by saying: Let us all make a bold determination that we must green the motherland within 12 years, and we must turn the motherland's land into a green ocean.

At today's meeting, the executive chairman announced that the conference had received nearly 70,000 catties of tree seeds, more than 7,000 tree seedlings, and other gifts donated to Yan'an, Shaanxi Province, Gansu Province, and the conference by 28 units in 20 provinces and cities across the country. The conference also received many congratulatory telegrams and letters from all over the country.

    新华社延安2日电　五省（区）青年造林大会2日下午继续举行。中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记处书记胡耀邦在会上作了“青年们！把绿化祖国的任务担当起来”的报告。
    胡耀邦在报告中指出了绿化我们伟大祖国的重要意义。胡耀邦在说明他的报告的时候提出了全国青年开展造林活动的四条要求和六条办法。四条要求就是党中央在致大会的贺电中所指示的：“不但要快造，而且要造好；不但要多栽，而且要栽活；不但要植树，而且要育苗；不但要造林，而且要护林。”六条办法就是：一、制定造林规划，实行计划造林；二、抓紧造林季节，实行突击造林；三、广泛建立苗圃，搞好基本建设；四、学习造林技术，提高造林质量；五、开展护林活动，保障森林安全；六、实行奖励制度，促进造林高潮。
    胡耀邦接着指出植树造林是保持水土的一项最重要的有效措施，保持黄土高原上的水土，就是实施根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的伟大计划的根本关键。因此，绿化黄土高原，做好高原的水土保持，是五省（区）全体青年一项艰巨的、相当长期的而又是十分光荣的任务。
    胡耀邦最后说：让我们大家都来下定一个豪迈的决心，我们一定要在12年内把祖国绿化起来，一定要把祖国的大地变成绿色的海洋。
    在今天的大会上，执行主席宣布大会收到了全国20个省、市的28个单位赠送给延安、陕西省、甘肃省和大会的树种近7万斤，树苗7，000多株和其他的礼品。大会还收到了来自全国各地的许多贺电和贺信。
