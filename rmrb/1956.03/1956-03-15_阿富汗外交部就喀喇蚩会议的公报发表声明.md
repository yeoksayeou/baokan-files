Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, March 13th (TASS) - "Friendship Newspaper" published a statement from the Afghan Foreign Ministry regarding the joint communiqué from the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council meeting recently held in Karachi.

The statement said that Afghanistan believes it is the legitimate right of the Pashtuns themselves to arrange the fate of Pashtunistan. This issue will continue to exist until the wishes of the people of Pashtunistan are fully satisfied. Afghanistan opposes the argument that the "Durand Line" (demarcated in 1893 after ceasefire negotiations between Britain and Afghanistan – TASS editor) is the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Afghanistan will never recognize the "Durand Line" as the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan.

As a peaceful and neutral country, Afghanistan hopes that its borders will be peaceful and tranquil, and therefore it supports the aspirations and political rights of the people of Pashtunistan; without these, it is impossible to maintain and strengthen peace in the region.

The statement continued that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council meeting ignored the right of self-determination of the Pashtuns. Afghanistan believes that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's policy toward the Pashtuns is contrary to the interests of the people living in this part of the world, and believes that this is a completely unjustified interference in their affairs.

Afghanistan is pursuing a firm and clear policy toward Pashtunistan based on the right of the people of Pashtunistan to arrange their own destiny, and nothing can force it to change this policy.

    阿富汗外交部就喀喇蚩会议的公报发表声明
    新华社据塔斯社喀布尔13日讯　“友谊报”刊载了阿富汗外交部就最近在喀喇蚩举行的东南亚条约组织理事会会议的联合公报发表的声明。
    声明说，阿富汗认为，由巴丹人自己来安排普什图尼斯坦的命运是他们的合法权利。这个问题将继续存在下去，直到普什图尼斯坦人民的愿望完全得到满足为止。阿富汗反对这种论据：“杜朗线”（在英国和阿富汗停战谈判以后在1893年划定的——塔斯社编者）是阿富汗同巴基斯坦的边界。阿富汗决不会承认“杜朗线”是阿富汗同巴基斯坦的边界。
    阿富汗作为一个和平的和中立的国家，希望它的边境得到和平和安宁，因此，它支持普什图尼斯坦人民的愿望和政治权利，没有这些，就不可能保持和加强这个地区的和平。
    声明继续说，东南亚条约组织理事会会议忽视了巴丹人的自决权利。阿富汗认为，东南亚条约组织对巴丹人的政策是违反住在世界这部分的人民的利益的，并且认为，这是对他们事务的完全不正当的干涉。
    阿富汗对普什图尼斯坦执行的是一种以普什图尼斯坦人民自己安排自己的命运的权利为基础的坚定不移的和明确的政策，没有任何东西能够迫使它改变这种政策。
