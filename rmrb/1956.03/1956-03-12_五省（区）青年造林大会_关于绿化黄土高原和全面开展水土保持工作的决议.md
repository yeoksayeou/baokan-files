The cadres of the Communist Youth League, forestry workers, and activists in afforestation and soil and water conservation who attended the Five Provinces (Regions) Youth Afforestation Congress resolutely support the instructions given to the congress by the Party Central Committee, and fully agree with the reports of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Ministry of Forestry, and the Yellow River Conservancy Commission.

All attendees deeply realize that greening the Loess Plateau and comprehensively carrying out soil and water conservation work is a very important and urgent task for the youth of the five provinces (regions). The Loess Plateau is an important and vast area in China's Yellow River basin, with great potential for developing industry and agriculture. However, due to loose soil, sparse forests, and severe soil erosion, year after year, the Yellow River is filled with sediment, the riverbed rises, and floods frequently occur, causing the soil in this area to become increasingly barren, and the people often suffer from natural disasters such as water, drought, wind, and sand. Now, the Sanmenxia Reservoir, a major project in the comprehensive plan to fundamentally control the Yellow River's water damage and develop Yellow River water conservancy, is about to begin construction; industrial construction in the middle reaches of the Yellow River is vigorously underway; and the upsurge in agricultural production is also unfolding in the vast rural areas. If the soil erosion on the Loess Plateau is not stopped, it will not only shorten the service life of the reservoir and affect the development of industry in the Yellow River basin, but also make it impossible to prevent water, drought, wind, and sand disasters and guarantee increased agricultural production. Therefore, greening the Loess Plateau and comprehensively carrying out soil and water conservation work is of great significance for the faster realization of the national comprehensive plan to fundamentally control the Yellow River's water damage and develop Yellow River water conservancy, increase agricultural production, and accelerate the pace of national industrialization. The youth of the five provinces (regions) should, under the leadership of the Party, contribute their greatest strength to completing the greening of the Loess Plateau and basically controlling soil erosion within ten years.

Large-scale afforestation and greening of the Loess Plateau is an important measure for maintaining soil and water, and it is also an activity in which the vast number of young people can make great contributions. The existing cultivated land area of the Loess Plateau accounts for only one-third of the total area, and there are vast barren mountains and wastelands that can be used for afforestation. The congress requires that the youth of the five provinces (regions) systematically build protective forests, water source forests, timber forests, and fruit tree forests in the middle reaches of the Yellow River. The congress agrees with the afforestation plans of the five provinces (regions) Communist Youth League committees and supports the initiatives put forward by young people in various places to launch large-scale afforestation and forest protection activities. The congress calls on the youth of Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, and Inner Mongolia to actively strive to complete the huge project of a "Great Green Wall" stretching from southern Inner Mongolia through Shanxi, northern Shaanxi, to western Gansu within ten years. The congress especially requires Communist Youth League committees and young people at all levels to implement the instructions given to the congress by the Party Central Committee in the afforestation movement: not only to build quickly, but also to build well; not only to plant more, but also to plant alive; not only to plant trees, but also to cultivate seedlings; not only to build forests, but also to protect them.

In order to strive to green the Loess Plateau within ten years, the youth of the five provinces (regions) should actively carry out the following specific activities:

First, universally establish youth afforestation shock brigades, and hold afforestation movement months or afforestation movement weeks every spring and autumn to launch afforestation competition movements. In order to green the vast, sparsely populated, and uninhabited barren mountains and wastelands, the Communist Youth League committees above the county level should also organize youth afforestation teams to carry out long-distance afforestation, adopting the principle of combining agriculture and sideline occupations.

Second, widely mobilize young people to participate in collecting tree seeds. Establish youth nurseries and adopt forms such as raising seedlings in flower pots to promote universal seedling cultivation. Young people in urban factories, mines, schools, government agencies, military units, streets, and other aspects should also organize activities to collect tree seeds to support the greening work in the vast rural areas.

Third, universally organize young people to learn afforestation techniques. Through spare-time technical schools, Michurin research groups, organizing visits, signing technical transfer contracts with forestry departments, and jointly holding forestry technical training classes, strive to enable the vast number of young people to master the basic knowledge of afforestation in a short period of time.

Fourth, establish youth forest protection teams (groups) to implement a joint forest protection system with zoned and segmented responsibilities and designated areas. Mobilize the masses to establish forest protection covenants, conduct regular inspections, and carry out mass forest protection movements.

The youth of the five provinces (regions) should not only play an active role in afforestation and forest protection, but also play a comprehensive role in all aspects of soil and water conservation work. The vast rural youth of the five provinces (regions) should actively participate in various tasks such as building terraces, constructing water conservancy projects, building dams to silt up land, cultivating pasture, and improving farming methods. A large-scale movement to comprehensively maintain soil and water should be launched in the vast rural areas of the Loess Plateau. Within 7 or 10 years, all land below 25 degrees in the hills and mountains of the Loess Plateau should be completely terraced; all gullies that can be dammed and silted up should be dammed and silted up; the original areas and broken original areas of the Wei River, the North Luo River, the Jing River, the Fen River, and other river basins should be completely preserved, so that they are no longer eroded into new gullies, achieving the requirements of "water not leaving the original area, soil not leaving the slope, mud not leaving the gully, and sand not moving south," and basically controlling soil erosion on the Loess Plateau.

In order to comprehensively do a good job in soil and water conservation, the vast number of Communist Youth League members and young people in rural areas should actively carry out the following activities:

First, widely conduct propaganda on soil and water conservation. It is necessary to break the conservative and superstitious ideas among the masses, so that the broad masses of people can realize that natural disasters can be overcome, and that doing a good job in soil and water conservation is not only an important measure to eliminate the Yellow River's water disasters, but also a fundamental method to prevent water, drought, wind, and sand disasters, improve agricultural production, and improve people's lives, which is a major matter related to their own vital interests and the future of their children and grandchildren.

Second, take the lead and set an example. The most effective way to persuade the masses and break their ideological concerns is to set an example. Young people should take the lead in implementing various measures for soil and water conservation, and through their own practical activities, improve the masses' confidence and enthusiasm for soil and water conservation work, and pave the way for carrying out large-scale soil and water conservation work.

Third, learn soil and water conservation techniques. Spare-time technical schools and technical research groups in agricultural production cooperatives should take soil and water conservation work as an important learning content. Rural youth in various places should actively organize visits and learning, learn from technicians engaged in soil and water conservation work, and learn from experienced people in the local area, so that they can become experts in soil and water conservation.

Fourth, organize shock brigades to give play to the shock role of young people in activities such as repairing terraces, building dams, building small reservoirs, and digging dry wells. In order to complete these projects more, faster, better, and more economically, the Communist Youth League organizations should also organize these shock brigades to launch competition activities.

In order to effectively organize the vast number of young people to participate in greening the Loess Plateau and soil and water conservation work, the Communist Youth League organizations of the five provinces (regions) should take the following measures to strengthen their leadership in this work:

First, the Communist Youth League organizations at all levels should, under the leadership of the Party committees at the same level, quickly cooperate closely with the local forestry departments and soil and water conservation work departments to formulate specific plans for various activities of young people in afforestation and soil and water conservation work. These plans should have relatively long-term goals and also have current specific tasks and practical measures.

Second, the Communist Youth League provincial and county committees should regularly study the participation of young people in afforestation and soil and water conservation work, and should designate a secretary or standing committee member to be responsible for managing this work. The Communist Youth League primary organizations in rural areas should all establish afforestation and soil and water conservation committees, specifically responsible for managing afforestation and soil and water conservation work.

Third, the Communist Youth League provincial and prefectural committees should, together with the forestry departments and soil and water conservation departments, conduct inspections on the afforestation and soil and water conservation work of young people every year. The Communist Youth League county committees should also choose an appropriate time each year to determine 3 to 5 days as the Youth Afforestation and Soil and Water Conservation Work Inspection Day for evaluation and summary. The congress suggests that the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Ministry of Forestry, and the Yellow River Conservancy Commission jointly convene a meeting every year to inspect the afforestation and soil and water conservation work of young people in the five provinces (regions), and the meeting should be held in the five provinces (regions) in rotation.

Fourth, the congress suggests that the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League convene a Youth Afforestation and Soil and Water Conservation Conference in the five provinces (regions) in Yan'an every three years; the second conference will be held in 1959. Each province (region) should also convene a provincial (regional) Youth Afforestation and Soil and Water Conservation Conference once a year or every two years; each county should convene one to two times a year. At the meetings at all levels, tasks should be assigned, experiences should be summarized and exchanged, and advanced collectives and individuals who have made outstanding achievements in greening and soil and water conservation work should be rewarded.

Fifth, establish a Greening the Motherland Exhibition Hall in Yan'an to encourage the enthusiasm of young people to green the motherland and disseminate the experience of afforestation and soil and water conservation work. Communist Youth League organizations, forestry departments, and soil and water conservation departments throughout the country are required to regularly send pictures, models, specimens, and various excellent tree species and seedlings of young people's afforestation and soil and water conservation activities. The congress entrusts the Shaanxi Provincial Forestry Department to jointly manage the exhibition hall with the Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League and the soil and water conservation departments.

Sixth, in order to train more young technical cadres who are willing to serve the greening of the Loess Plateau and the transformation of the Loess Plateau, it is recommended that the Ministry of Forestry and the Shaanxi Provincial People's Committee establish a forestry technical school in Yan'an. This school should also train advanced model figures who have emerged in the afforestation and soil and water conservation work of young people in the five provinces (regions).

The congress believes that the youth of the five provinces (regions) will regard it as the supreme glory to be able to personally participate in the greening of the Loess Plateau and comprehensive soil and water conservation work. The youth taught by the great Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao will be filled with a hundred times the confidence and courage in the face of this huge task, carry forward a high degree of socialist enthusiasm and a tenacious spirit of overcoming difficulties, act in unison, actively participate in afforestation and soil and water conservation work, and strive to the end to green the Loess Plateau of the motherland, fundamentally control the Yellow River's water damage, develop Yellow River water conservancy, and accelerate the country's socialist construction.

    五省（区）青年造林大会
    关于绿化黄土高原和全面开展水土保持工作的决议
  一出席五省（区）青年造林大会的青年团的干部、林业工作者和植树造林、水土保持的积极分子，坚决拥护党中央给予大会的指示，并且完全同意团中央、林业部和黄河水利委员会的报告。
    全体出席人员深刻地认识到：绿化黄土高原，全面开展水土保持工作，是五省（区）青年一项非常重要而迫切的任务。黄土高原是我国黄河流域一个重要而广大的地区，具有发展工业和农业的巨大潜力。但是由于土质松散，森林稀少，水土流失非常严重，经年累月，使黄河饱含泥沙，河床升高，经常泛滥成灾，使这一地区的土壤日趋贫瘠，人民常常遭受水、旱、风、砂等自然灾害的威胁。现在，根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划中的一项重要工程三门峡水库即将开工；黄河中游的工业建设，正在大力进行；而农业生产的高潮，也在广大农村中间展开，如果不制止黄土高原的水土流失，不但会缩短水库的使用年限，影响黄河流域的工业的发展，而且，也无从防止水、旱、风、砂灾害，保证农业的增产。因此，绿化黄土高原，全面开展水土保持工作，对于更快地实现国家根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划，增加农业生产，加快国家工业化的速度，具有十分重大的意义。五省（区）青年应当在党的领导下为争取在十年内完成绿化黄土高原和基本上控制水土流失而贡献自己的最大力量。
  二大规模地植树造林，绿化黄土高原，是保持水土的一个重要措施，也是广大青少年能够作出巨大贡献的一项活动。黄土高原现有的耕地面积只占全面积的三分之一，有广大的荒山荒地可以植树造林。大会要求五省
  （区）青少年们在黄河中游地区，有计划地营造防护林、水源林、用材林和果木林。大会同意五省（区）团委的造林规划，并支持各地青年为掀起大规模植树造林护林活动而提出的倡议。大会号召陕西、甘肃、山西、内蒙古四省（区）青少年为在十年内完成一条从内蒙古南部经山西、陕西北部直至甘肃西部的万里绿长城的巨大工程而积极奋斗。大会特别要求各级团委和青少年，在植树造林运动中，贯彻执行党中央给予大会的指示：不但要快造，而且要造好；不但要多栽，而且要栽活；不但要植树，而且要育苗；不但要造林，而且要护林。
    为了争取在十年内绿化黄土高原，五省（区）青少年应当积极开展以下几项具体活动：
    第一、普遍建立青年造林突击队，在每年春秋两季，举行造林运动月或造林运动周，展开造林竞赛运动。为了绿化地广人稀和无人居住的荒山荒原，县以上团委还应当组织青年造林队，采取同农业和副业相结合的方针，进行远距离的造林。
    第二、广泛发动青少年参加采集树种的活动。建立青少年苗圃和采取花盆育苗等形式，提倡普遍育苗。城市中工矿、学校、机关、部队、街道等方面的青少年，也应当组织采集树种的活动，支援广大农村的绿化工作。
    第三、普遍组织青年学习造林技术，通过业余技术学校，米丘林研究小组，组织参观访问、同林业部门订立技术传授合同和联合举办林业技术训练班等方式，力求在短期内使广大青年掌握造林的基本知识。
    第四、建立青年护林队（组），实行分区划段、分片包干的联防护林制度。发动群众订立护林公约，定期检查，开展群众性的护林运动。
  三五省（区）的青少年，不但要在植树造林护林中发挥积极作用，而且要在水土保持的各项工作中，全面地发挥作用。五省（区）的广大农村青年，应当积极的参加修筑梯田、兴修水利、打坝淤地、栽培牧草、改良耕种方法等各项工作。要在黄土高原的广大农村中，掀起大规模的全面保持水土的运动，分别在7年或10年内，把黄土高原的丘陵和山区的25度以下的土地，全部修成梯田，在能够打坝淤地的沟壑，全部打坝淤地；把渭河、北洛河、泾河、汾河等流域的原区和破碎原区，全部保存下来，不再被冲成新的沟壑，达到水不下原、土不下坡、泥不出沟、砂不南移的要求，基本上控制黄土高原的水土流失。
    为了全面地作好水土保持工作，农村的广大团员和青少年，要积极开展如下几项活动：
    第一、广泛地进行水土保持的宣传。要打破群众中的保守思想和迷信思想，使广大群众认识到自然灾害是可以战胜的，作好水土保持工作不但是消除黄河水灾的一个重要措施，而且是防止水旱风砂等灾害、提高农业生产、改善人民生活的根本方法，是关系到自己切身利益和子孙后代的大事。
    第二、积极带头，树立榜样。说服群众，打破群众思想顾虑的一个最有效的方法，就是树立榜样。青年应当带头实行水土保持的各种措施，通过自己的实际活动，提高群众对水土保持工作的信心和积极性，为开展大规模的水土保持工作开辟道路。
    第三、学习水土保持的技术。农业生产合作社中的业余技术学校和技术研究小组要把水土保持工作当作一项重要的学习内容。各地农村青年要积极地组织参观学习并向水土保持工作的技术人员学习、向当地有经验的人学习，使自己成为水土保持的能手。
    第四、组织突击队，发挥青年在修梯田、筑坝、修筑小型水库、打旱井等项活动中的突击作用。为了更多、更快、更好、更省地完成这些工程，团的组织还应当组织这些突击队展开竞赛活动。四
    为了有效地组织广大青少年参加绿化黄土高原和水土保持工作，五省
  （区）团的组织应当采取以下措施，加强对这项工作的领导：
    第一、各级团的组织，应当在同级党委的领导下，迅速同当地林业部门和水土保持工作部门密切配合，制定出当地青年在植树造林和水土保持工作中各项活动的具体规划。这些规划要有比较长远的奋斗目标，也要有当前的具体任务和切实可行的措施。
    第二、团的省委和县委应当经常对青年参加植树造林和水土保持工作进行研究，并且要确定一个书记或常委负责管理这项工作。农村团的基层组织都应当设立造林和水土保持委员，专门负责管理植树造林和水土保持工作。
    第三、团的省委和地委每年都应当会同林业部门、水土保持部门，对青年植树造林和水土保持工作进行检查。团的县委每年也应当选择适当的时间，确定3天至5天为青年植树造林和水土保持工作检查日，进行评比总结。大会建议团中央、林业部和黄河水利委员会每年联合召开一次检查五省（区）青年植树造林和水土保持工作的会议，会议轮流在五省（区）举行。
    第四、建议团中央每隔3年在延安召开一次五省（区）青年造林和水土保持会议；第二次会议在1959年召开。各省（区）也应当每年或每两年召开一次省（区）的青年造林和水土保持会议；各县应当每年召开一次到两次。在各级的会议上，应当布置任务，总结和交流经验，奖励在绿化和水土保持工作中作出优异成绩的青少年先进集体和个人。
    第五、在延安建立一个绿化祖国展览馆，借以鼓舞广大青少年绿化祖国的积极性，并且传播植树造林和水土保持工作的经验。要求全国各地青年团组织、林业部门和水土保持部门，经常选送青少年植树造林和保持水土活动的图片、模型、标本和各种优良树种、树苗。大会委托陕西省林业厅会同团省委和水土保持部门负责这个展览馆的经常管理工作。
    第六、为了培养更多的志愿为绿化黄土高原、改造黄土高原而服务的青年技术干部，建议林业部和陕西省人民委员会在延安建立一所林业技术学校。这个学校同时应当训练五省
  （区）青年在植树造林和水土保持工作中出现的先进模范人物。五
    大会相信，五省（区）青少年将以能够亲身参加绿化黄土高原和全面的水土保持工作，引为无上的光荣。由伟大的中国共产党和毛主席教导出来的青少年，在这个巨大的任务面前，一定会充满百倍的信心和勇气，发扬高度的社会主义积极性和顽强的克服困难的精神，一致行动起来，积极参加植树造林和水土保持工作，为绿化祖国黄土高原，根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利，加速国家社会主义建设而奋斗到底。
