	Cutting Efficiency Increased Fivefold
	The Soviet Union is currently promoting an advanced lathe tool method - the Stalyanzov lathe tool method. Soviet expert Goncharov, based on the introduction in the Soviet "Labor News," recommended this lathe tool method to the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant and helped them successfully test it. Wang Xikui, a lathe operator in Workshop 1A62, used this lathe tool method to process lathe spindles, increasing cutting efficiency by an average of more than five times.
	In order to rapidly improve the technical level of our country's industry, we must find every way to learn and master the latest experiences in the world. We thank Soviet experts for introducing us to such experiences; we should also establish and develop our own technical information work, to widely and promptly understand and collect all the latest technological achievements and materials in the world. All industrial departments, especially research institutions, must first take responsibility and start this work as soon as possible.

    切削效率提高五倍
    苏联最近正在推行一种先进的车刀法——斯塔良佐夫车刀法。苏联专家冈卡洛夫根据苏联“劳动报”上介绍的情况，把这种车刀法推荐给沈阳第一机床厂，并且帮助他们试验成功。一A六二车间的车工王希奎用这种车刀法加工车床主轴，切削效率平均提高五倍以上。
    为了迅速提高我国工业的技术水平，我们必须想一切办法学习和掌握世界上最新的经验。我们感谢苏联专家给我们介绍这样的经验；我们也应当建立和开展自己的技术情报工作，广泛地、及时地了解和搜集世界上一切最新的技术成就和资料。各个工业部门，特别是各个研究机关，首先要负起责任来，尽速地着手进行这项工作。
