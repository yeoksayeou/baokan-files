    The United States, Britain, France, and the West German government recently engaged in a dispute over the cost of maintaining troops in West Germany. Due to significant contradictions between them, negotiations to resolve this issue, described as "a series of tricky negotiations," only began on March 14 after some delay.
    It is known that according to the Paris Agreements signed in 1954, the United States, Britain, and France would maintain a garrison of 500,000 troops in West Germany for decades after West Germany gained "sovereignty." The Paris Agreements also stipulated that West Germany would cease paying cash to cover the expenses of Western countries' troops stationed there by May 5 of this year, and that relevant countries would hold negotiations on this issue. Last year, the West German government formally sent notes to the United States, Britain, and France, expressing its readiness to stop supporting the occupation troops. The United States, Britain, and France expressed dissatisfaction with this action by West Germany, demanding that the West German government continue to pay for the expenses of their troops stationed there. However, West German Finance Minister Schäffer "flatly" rejected the demands of the Western countries, openly accusing these demands of being "completely unreasonable." Some West German party leaders and many influential newspapers also supported Schäffer's position, opposing this "illegal plunder." The United States, Britain, and France recently submitted a memorandum to West Germany, insisting that West Germany "must continue to bear a considerable portion of the cost of Western defense forces stationed in Germany."
    Supporting Western countries' troops had always been a heavy burden for West Germany. From the end of the war until 1954, West Germany had already spent approximately 77 billion marks on this. This expense accounted for almost one-third of West Germany's budget each year. Currently, West Germany is embarking on an accelerated plan to rearm, preparing to spend at least 30 billion marks to rebuild its armed forces in the next three years. This also accounts for about one-third of the annual budget. In addition, West Germany must also repay pre-war, wartime, and post-war debts of 22 billion marks to the United States, Britain, and France in the coming years. West Germany is clearly unwilling to continue bearing the cost of billions of marks per year to support Western countries' troops. Many West German political figures and newspapers had long estimated that the cost of West German rearmament alone would cause economic difficulties for West Germany, let alone adding other additional burdens.
    However, the United States, Britain, and France each have their own calculations. The United States has consistently criticized the slow pace of West German remilitarization and indicated that West Germany's actual burden is not too heavy. Therefore, they believe that "West Germany should continue to pay a large portion of these expenses until West German rearmament has made further progress." It is clear that the United States wants to use this as a means of urging West Germany to accelerate rearmament according to American plans.
    It is also known that some Western countries have always regarded rearming West Germany as a means of weakening West Germany's economic strength in order to alleviate the pressure West Germany places on them in the capitalist world market. At the same time, they regard the expenses West Germany provides to their troops as a not insignificant supplement to their strained finances. Now, if West Germany stops paying the cost of maintaining Western countries' troops, it will increase their own financial expenditures. Take Britain, for example, it would have to increase military spending by 90 million pounds a year. This is no small matter for Britain, which is already burdened with heavy military spending, a growing foreign trade deficit, declining foreign exchange reserves, and facing the threat of domestic inflation. It will inevitably further worsen the British economy and weaken its competitiveness in the capitalist world market. There are similar situations for France. Therefore, they are trying their best to continue to place the burden of troop maintenance costs on West Germany in order to create economic difficulties for West Germany and thereby alleviate their own difficulties. Many British bourgeois newspapers do not conceal their intentions. For example, Walter Farr, the diplomatic commentator for the "Daily Mail," warned that stopping the payment of occupation costs would "greatly strengthen West Germany's position as an export competitor against Britain in the world market." This clearly reflects the opinions of British monopoly capitalists.
    However, West German monopoly capitalists are not fools. They are striving to rebuild their position in the capitalist world market. They are determined to get rid of the heavy burden of troop maintenance costs in order to further strengthen their outward economic expansion and facilitate the implementation of remilitarization plans.
    Therefore, the quarrel over West Germany's occupation fee burden actually reflects the fierce struggle between Western countries and West German monopolies for the world market. Rearming West Germany will inevitably intensify the contradictions between them.
    Facts have clearly shown that the continued stationing of foreign troops in Germany is not beneficial to the German people or to the people of the Western occupying countries. The Soviet government has repeatedly proposed withdrawing the occupation troops from Germany. Doing so would not only alleviate the burden on the German people and the peoples of the United States, Britain, and France, but also help promote the peaceful reunification of Germany and ease the situation in Europe. But these proposals have been rejected by Western countries. Now is the time for them to reconsider this issue.

    在西德驻军供养费问题上的争吵
    席林生
    不久以前美、英、法三国和西德政府在西德驻军的供养费用问题上发生了争执。由于它们之间的矛盾很大，因而在拖了一阵之后，才于三月十四日开始“进行一连串的辣手的谈判”，来谋求解决这个问题。
    人们知道，根据1954年签订的巴黎协定，美、英、法在西德获得“主权”以后的几十年中，还将在西德保持着五十万的驻军。同时巴黎协定又规定，西德在今年五月五日，便将停止用现款继续担负西方国家驻军的供养费，而由有关各国就这个问题举行谈判。西德政府在去年就向美、英、法正式提出照会，表示准备停止供养占领军。美、英、法三国对于西德的这种行动表示不满，要求西德政府继续支付美、英、法驻军的开支。但是西德财政部长谢菲尔“直截了当”地拒绝了西方国家的要求，并公开指责这种要求是“完全没有理由的”。西德的一些政党领袖和许多有影响的报纸也支持谢菲尔的立场，反对这种“非法的掠夺”。美英法三国不久以前向西德提出了一份备忘录，坚持西德“必须继续负担西方驻德的防御军队相当大的费用”。
    对西方国家驻军的供养一直是西德的一个沉重的负担。战后以来到1954年为止，西德已经为此花费了大约770多亿马克。这笔开支每年差不多要占到西德预算的三分之一。目前，西德正在着手加速实现重新武装的计划，准备在今后三年内花费至少300亿马克来重建它的国防军。这同样占到每年预算的三分之一左右。此外在今后几年中，西德还必须偿付美、英、法等国的战前、战时及战后的债款220亿马克。西德显然不愿意继续负担每年几十亿马克供养西方国家驻军的费用。许多西德政治人物和报纸早就估计，仅仅西德重新武装的费用就将造成西德经济上的困难，更不用说再要加上其他额外的负担了。
    但是美、英、法三国却各有自己的算盘。美国一直指责西德重新军国主义化的速度缓慢，并且表示西德的实际负担还不太重。因此，它们认为“西德应该继续支付这些经费中的很大一部分，直到西德的重新武装有了进一步的进展”为止。很明显，美国是想借此作为督促西德按照美国的规划加速重新武装的一种手段。
    人们也知道，西方的一些国家一直把重新武装西德作为削弱西德的经济力量的一种手段，以减轻在资本主义世界市场上西德对它们的压力。同时它们也把西德供给它们驻军的费用看成是对它们窘迫的财政的一项不太小的弥补。现在，如果西德停止支付西方国家驻军供养费，那就要增加它们自身财政的开支。拿英国来说，一年就得增加军费九千万英镑。这对军备负担已经很沉重、对外贸易逆差正在不断增大、外汇储备日益减少以及国内面临着通货膨胀威胁的英国，是一件非同小可的事情，它必然会使英国经济进一步恶化，并将削弱它在资本主义世界市场上的竞争能力。对于法国，也有类似的情况。因此它们竭力想继续把驻军供养费的负担压在西德的头上，以造成西德的经济困难，从而减轻它们自己的困难。英国的许多资产阶级报纸并不掩饰它们的这种用心。如“每日邮报”外交评论员华尔特·法尔就警告说，停止支付占领费用将“大大加强西德作为英国在世界市场上的出口竞争者的地位”。这显然是反映了英国垄断资本家的意见。
    但是西德的垄断资本家并不是傻瓜。他们正在竭力重建他们在资本主义世界市场上的地位。他们一心要摆脱驻军供养费的重担，以便进一步加强对外的经济扩张并便利于实行重新军国主义化的计划。
    因此关于西德占领费负担的争吵，实际上反映了西方国家和西德垄断资本争夺世界市场的激烈斗争。重新武装西德不可避免地要使它们之间的矛盾加剧。
    事实已清楚地表明，在德国继续驻扎外国军队，不仅对德国人民而且对西方占领国家人民都是没有好处的。苏联政府早已一再建议撤退驻德占领军。这样做不但会减轻德国人民和美英法等国家人民的负担，而且将有助于促进德国的和平统一，缓和欧洲的局势。但是这些建议一直被西方国家所拒绝。现在这个问题应该是它们重新考虑的时候了。
