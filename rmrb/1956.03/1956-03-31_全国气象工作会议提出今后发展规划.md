The National Meteorological Work Conference, which closed on the 28th, studied the issue of accelerating the construction of China's meteorological undertaking and further improving the quality of meteorological services for the national economy, based on the instructions in the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) regarding the construction of meteorological observatory and station networks, and the requirements of agricultural, industrial, and transportation development for meteorological work. It also discussed the construction tasks of meteorological observatories and stations for this year and next year, and the future twelve-year development plan proposed by Tu Changwang, Director of the Central Meteorological Bureau, which requires that within twelve years, the construction of meteorological stations, meteorological business work, and meteorological science should respectively approach, catch up with, or surpass the international advanced level.

This conference, convened by the Central Meteorological Bureau in Beijing, lasted a total of twelve days.

Vice Premier of the State Council Deng Zihui attended the meeting and gave instructions. Soviet expert Prosgyakov gave a report on the work of the Soviet Hydrometeorological Agency at the meeting. The meeting studied and researched Deng Zihui's instructions and Prosgyakov's report.

The meeting pointed out that it is necessary to complete the construction of various meteorological observatory and station networks at a high speed under the overall plan of China's socialist construction and according to needs and possibilities, especially the construction of stations in remote areas; to comprehensively carry out observation operations; to vigorously train technical cadres; to carry out meteorological scientific research with emphasis; and to actively carry out specialized services for various forecasts and data.

According to the above requirements, the meeting proposed that the tasks for this year and next year are that by the end of 1957, the construction tasks of stations stipulated in the first five-year plan should be overfulfilled by about 28%. Most of these stations to be built are meteorological stations, climate stations, sounding stations, and marine observation stations. In order to better serve agricultural production, the meeting decided that in the next two years, efforts should be concentrated on carrying out agricultural meteorological observation work. Observation of crop growth and development stages, soil moisture observation, soil evaporation, and field climate observation should be universally carried out in farm climate stations, and timely and accurate dangerous weather warnings and general weather forecasts should be made available to rural areas, and frost forecasting should be further improved. In addition, it is also necessary to add necessary meteorological stations and outposts near air routes to further improve the professional service of civil aviation meteorology.

    全国气象工作会议提出今后发展规划
    二十八日闭幕的全国气象工作会议，根据全国农业发展纲要（草案）中关于建设气象台、站网的指示，和农业、工业及交通运输业发展对气象工作的要求，研究了加速中国气象事业建设和进一步提高气象业务为国民经济服务的质量问题，并且讨论了今、明两年气象台、站的建设任务和中央气象局局长涂长望报告中提出的今后十二年的发展规划；即要求在十二年内，无论气象台站建设、气象业务工作和气象科学，分别接近、赶上或者超过国际的先进水平。
    这个会议是中央气象局在北京召开的，历时共十二天。
    国务院副总理邓子恢曾经到会作了指示。苏联专家普罗斯嘉柯夫在会上作了关于苏联水文气象机构工作的报告。会议对邓子恢的指示和普罗斯嘉柯夫的报告进行了学习和研究。
    会议指出，必需在我国社会主义建设的总体规划下、按照需要和可能高速度地完成各种气象台、站网的建设，特别是边远地区的台站建设；全面开展观测业务；大力培养技术干部，有重点地开展气象科学研究工作，积极地进行各项预报和资料的专业化服务工作。
    根据上述要求，会议提出今、明两年的任务是，到1957年底，要超额28％左右完成第一个五年计划规定的台、站建设任务。这些要建设的台、站大部是气象站、气候站、探空站和海洋观测站。为了更好地为农业生产服务，会议确定今后两年要集中力量开展农业气象观测工作，在农场气候站要普遍开展农作物生长发育阶段的观测、土壤湿度的观测、土壤蒸发和田间气候的观测，并要求及时准确地做到危险天气警报和一般天气预报下乡，进一步做好霜冻预报工作。此外，还要在航线附近增设必要的气象站、哨，进一步做好民航气象的专业服务工作。　（据新华社讯）
