The 133 newly joint state-private factories in 13 light industry sectors in Shanghai, including pharmaceuticals, food, cultural and educational supplies, and dairy products, overcame various difficulties in the socialist emulation drive and successfully completed their February production tasks.

The five factories in the medical equipment industry increased their February syringe production by an average of more than 50% compared to January, and the production time was reduced by 3 days compared to January. However, they completed the task on schedule, and the rate of by-products and substandard products was also reduced by 5-17% compared to January. The implementation of quality indicators in each factory in February was generally better than in January. More than half of the 53 pharmaceutical factories completed the quality indicators.
