Scientific Popularization Work in the Hangzhou County Area, Zhejiang
Zhou Shensheng

Hangzhou County, Zhejiang, is a medium-sized county with a population of nearly 400,000. With the rapid development of the agricultural cooperative movement, the farmers of Hangzhou County, after being organized, urgently demanded to master scientific and technological knowledge. Some enthusiastic science workers in Hangzhou County advocated the establishment of scientific popularization groups to organize more science workers to popularize scientific and technological knowledge to the working people. In June 1954, with the support of the county party committee and the guidance of the Provincial Science and Technology Popularization Association, they established the Hangzhou County Scientific Popularization Temporary Working Group. In March 1955, it was renamed the Hangzhou County Area Group of the Zhejiang Provincial Science and Technology Popularization Association.

After the establishment of the Hangzhou County Area Group, according to the instructions of the county party committee, in accordance with the principle of "oriented towards the countryside, serving agricultural production," it gradually carried out its work by taking agricultural production cooperatives as the main base and rural cadres and key members of agricultural production cooperatives as the main targets, through lectures.

The work began at the Pingyao District County Farm. With the support of the district party committee, a science and technology lecture series was established at the county farm. The farm technician (a member of the science popularization association) was responsible for lecturing, and the farm director and township head organized farm workers and key members from sixteen agricultural production cooperatives in three neighboring townships to attend the lectures. The lecture series was thus started.

The lectures were generally held once every half month, covering knowledge that local farmers urgently needed. After listening to the lectures, the key members of the cooperatives would also convey the information to everyone at the members' meetings, production team meetings, and management committee meetings. This method was very popular among the members. The members regarded the farm's lectures as their own agricultural school, and no matter how cold the weather or how far the road, they would rush to attend each time. The science and technology lecture series did indeed play a significant role in production. For example, Liangzhu Township rarely planted grass seeds in the past. After the key members of the township's agricultural cooperatives listened to the lecture on "Grass Seed Cultivation Methods" at the farm, they actively expanded the area of grass seed planting and tried out the "Grass Seed Cultivation Methods," which increased the yield of grass seeds to 4,500 jin per mu, doubling the previous year's yield. They said, "Learning technology has so many benefits, we are willing to go even if the road is farther."

In order to establish more bases for scientific popularization work in agricultural production cooperatives, the Hangzhou County Area Group also held science and technology lectures at the Wu Jiadi Agricultural Production Cooperative. This lecture series was conducted under the unified leadership of the cooperative's club and under the specific control of a science popularization group composed of the cooperative's farmer technicians. The club arranged four lectures a month according to the farmers' needs: two lectures on agricultural knowledge, one on hygiene knowledge, and one on natural science knowledge. Every Friday evening, technicians from the agricultural technology extension station, doctors from the health clinic, midwives from the maternal and child health station, and primary school teachers were invited to give lectures. As with the situation at the farm, the lectures powerfully promoted production. For example, at that time, the cooperative urgently needed to solve the fertilizer problem. After listening to the lecture on "How to Accumulate Compost," everyone learned that all green grass could be used to make compost, so they actively searched for fertilizer sources. As a result, they used the green grass in the river harbor to make more than 12,000 dan of compost and also carried more than 40,000 dan of river mud. After the young people in the cooperative understood basic agricultural technology knowledge, they also started "Youth Experimental Fields" under the leadership of the Communist Youth League branch, trying out various varieties. Among them, the "10509" rice variety grew particularly well, with more than 300 grains per plant. They are now selecting the best ones from it to keep as seeds, preparing to further cultivate better varieties.

The lectures not only promoted production but also helped farmers correctly understand natural phenomena, break superstitions, and improve their level of hygiene knowledge. After the female members listened to the lecture on "Maternal and Child Health Knowledge," they understood what menstruation is and how to prevent menstrual diseases, and many people made more standard menstrual belts. In the past, many women were afraid of encountering health workers after becoming pregnant, but now they actively go to the health station to request prenatal checkups. In particular, they were very moved after listening to "How to Raise Your Children Well," saying, "There are so many principles to being a mother! If Chairman Mao had come earlier, we wouldn't have treated the umbilical cord wind as a debt collector."

Now, the Hangzhou County Area Group has established lectures in most districts and has begun to carry out scientific popularization work in different situations according to different audiences. In the past year or more, 174 lectures have been given, including 108 lectures on agricultural knowledge, 33 on hygiene knowledge, and 33 on natural science knowledge. In addition, propaganda was also carried out through wired broadcasting, holding picture and model exhibitions, publishing irregular "Science Popularization Small Newspapers," and opening a science and technology column in the "Hangzhou County Daily."

With the development of scientific popularization work, the Hangzhou County Area Group has united more science workers. Originally, there were only eight science popularization members in Hangzhou County, but now it has developed to more than fifty. Many non-member science workers have also actively participated in the work under the leadership of the science popularization organization and members.

The development of scientific popularization work in Hangzhou County is inseparable from the support and leadership of the Hangzhou County Party Committee. The county party committee not only regularly encourages science workers to participate in scientific popularization work but also puts forward specific requirements to the scientific popularization group according to the central work and production tasks of the party committee during a certain period; it regularly urges relevant departments to pay attention to scientific popularization work; it pays attention to the ideological education of science workers and helps them improve their professional level, and solves the difficulties in their work. The responsible comrades of many district party committees are also very concerned about science popularization work. For example, the Linping District Party Committee invites members of the Science Popularization Association to give science and technology lectures almost every time it holds a full district cadre meeting.

Although scientific popularization work in Hangzhou County has developed to a certain extent, there are still some shortcomings in developing members, establishing organizations, and establishing lecture stations. For example, the current members are less than 20% compared with the science workers in the county who are eligible to join the association, there are no member working groups in each district, and there are not more fixed lecture bases—lecture stations—established in agricultural production cooperatives. The quantity and quality of work cannot fully meet the requirements of the masses. In order to change this situation, the Hangzhou County Party Committee has included strengthening scientific popularization work in its plan. It plans to recruit more than 80% of science workers with intermediate technical school graduation levels or higher into the association within one year, and to establish science popularization member working groups in each district; at the same time, with the establishment of the rural club network, lecture stations will be established first in the central clubs, and transmission stations will be established in nearby general cooperatives, gradually forming a science and technology lecture network in the countryside, so that scientific and technological popularization work can be carried out more widely and deeply throughout the county.

    浙江杭县地区的科学普及工作
    周申生
    浙江杭县是一个近四十万人口的中等县。随着农业合作化运动的迅速发展，杭县的农民在组织起来以后，就迫切要求掌握科学技术知识。杭县的一些热情的科学工作者倡议成立科学普及小组，组织更多的科学工作者向劳动人民普及科学技术知识。1954年6月，他们在县委的支持和省科学技术普及协会的指导下，成立了杭县科学普及临时工作组。1955年3月，改称浙江省科学技术普及协会杭县地区小组。
    杭县地区小组成立后，根据县委的指示，依照“面向农村，为农业生产服务”的方针，以农业生产合作社为主要阵地，以农村干部和农业生产合作社的骨干分子为主要对象，通过讲演的方式，逐步开展了工作。
    工作首先从瓶窑区县农场开始。在区委的支持下，在县农场建立了科学技术讲座。由农场技术员（科普会员）负责讲课，农场场长和乡长组织农场工人，邻近三个乡十六个农业生产合作社的骨干分子前来听讲。讲座就这样办起来了。
    讲座一般是半个月举行一次，讲的都是当地农民迫切需要的知识，合作社骨干分子听讲回去以后，还在社员大会、生产队会和管理委员会上向大家传达。这种办法很受社员的欢迎，社员们把农场的讲座看成是自己的农业学校，不论天气多么冷、路多么远，每次都赶去听讲。科学技术讲座在生产上确实起了很大的作用，如良渚乡过去很少种草子，该乡农业合作社骨干分子到农场听了“草子栽培法”以后，积极地扩大了草子种植面积，试行了“草子栽培法”，使草子的产量提高到每亩四千五百斤，比往年增加了一倍。他们说：“学习技术有这样多的好处，就是路再远一些，我们也愿意去。”
    为了使科学技术普及工作在农业生产合作社中建立更多的基地，杭县地区小组又在吴家棣农业生产合作社办了科学技术讲座。这个讲座是在合作社俱乐部的统一领导下，在合作社农民技术员组成的一个科学普及组的具体掌握下进行活动的。俱乐部根据农民的要求，一个月安排了四次讲演，两次讲农业知识，一次讲卫生知识，一次讲自然科学知识。每个星期五的晚上，请农业技术推广站的技术员、卫生所的医师、妇幼保健站的助产士、小学教师等给大家讲课。同在农场的情况一样，讲座有力地推动了生产。如当时社里迫切需要解决肥料问题，大家听了“怎样积堆肥”的讲演，知道一切青草都可以用来作堆肥，便积极找肥源，结果把河港里的青草用来做了一万二千多担堆肥，还挑了四万多担河泥。社里的青年懂得了基本农业技术知识以后，在团支部的领导下，还搞起“青年试验田”，试种各种品种，其中“10509”稻种长得特别好，一棵有三百多粒，他们现在又从中选出最好的留着作种子，准备进一步培育更好的品种。
    讲座不仅推动了生产，而且还帮助农民正确地认识自然现象，破除迷信，提高了卫生知识水平。女社员们听了“妇幼卫生知识”的讲演以后，懂得了什么叫月经和怎样预防月经病，很多人都做了比较标准的月经带；过去许多妇女怀孕后怕碰到保健员，现在却主动到保健站要求作产前检查了；特别是她们听了“怎样带好你的孩子”以后，非常感动，说：“做妈妈还有这样多的道理！毛主席早一点来，我们也不会把脐带风当作讨债鬼了。”
    现在，杭县地区小组已在大部分区里建立了讲座，并且开始根据不同对象，利用不同场合进行科学普及工作。一年多以来，已经作过174次讲演，其中有108次讲的是农业知识，三十三次卫生知识，三十三次自然科学知识。此外，还通过有线广播、举办图片模型展览、出版不定期的“科普小报”、在“杭县报”上开辟了科学技术专栏等方式进行宣传。
    随着科学普及工作的开展，杭县地区小组团结了更多的科学工作者，原来杭县只有八个科普会员，现在已发展到五十多人了。许多非会员的科学工作者在科普组织和会员的带动下也都积极地参加了工作。
    杭县科学普及工作的开展是和杭县县委的支持和领导分不开的。县委不仅是经常鼓励科学工作者参加科学普及工作，并且根据一定时期党委的中心工作和生产任务，对科学普及小组提出具体要求；经常督促有关部门重视科学普及工作；注意对科学工作者的思想教育，并帮助他们提高业务水平，解决他们工作中的困难。许多区委的负责同志对科普工作也很关心，如临平区委几乎每次开全区干部会议的时候，都要请科普协会会员作科学技术讲演。
    杭县的科学普及工作虽然有了一定程度的开展，但是，在发展会员、建立组织、建立讲演站等方面仍存在一些缺点。如目前的会员同全县具备入会条件的科学工作者比较还不及20％，各区还没有会员工作组，在农业生产合作社里还没有更多地建立固定的讲演据点——讲演站，工作的数量和质量都还不能完全满足广大群众的要求。为了改变这种状况，杭县县委已将加强科学普及工作列入规划。计划在一年内将具有中等技术学校毕业程度的科学工作者80％以上吸收入会，在各区普遍建立科普会员工作组；同时，随着农村俱乐部网的建立，首先在中心俱乐部建立讲演站，在附近一般社建立传授站，逐步在农村中组成一个科学技术讲演网，使科学技术普及工作在全县范围内更广泛更深入地开展起来。
