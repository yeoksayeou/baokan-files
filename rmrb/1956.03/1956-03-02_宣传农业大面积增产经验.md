Publicize Experience in Large-Scale Agricultural Production Increase
Liu Kai

With the upsurge of agricultural cooperation, a high tide of agricultural production has emerged throughout the country. In order to meet the needs of the production high tide, local newspapers should vigorously introduce various agricultural production increase experiences, especially large-scale production increase experiences, to inspire the masses' confidence in increasing production and teach them methods for increasing production. In this regard, the Fujian Daily and the Southern Daily have already made a good start.

The main food crops in Fujian Province are sweet potatoes and rice. Both of these were originally high-yield crops, but due to backward farming techniques and other reasons in Fujian Province, the yields of these two crops were not high: sweet potatoes averaged just over 1,300 catties per mu, and rice averaged just over 280 catties per mu. In response to the above situation, the Fujian Daily vigorously publicized the fact that more than 400 mu of sweet potato land in Fuqing County adopted the "large ridge close planting" production increase experience of Dongying Township, and generally achieved increased production, with the highest yield exceeding 13,000 catties per mu and the average yield reaching 10,000 catties per mu. The Fujian Daily also introduced the experience of Jianyang County in the northern Fujian mountainous area, which changed from single-cropping rice to double-cropping rice, generally increasing production by 60%, as well as experiences from other regions. The Southern Daily also pays great attention to introducing agricultural production increase experiences. In the past two months, in addition to publishing the experience of Chaoan County and Chenghai County, the first thousand-catty counties in the country, in vigorously building water conservancy projects, overcoming various natural disasters, and comprehensively carrying out agricultural technology reforms to achieve a county-wide thousand-catty bumper harvest, the Southern Daily also introduced successful examples and good experiences of carrying out various different agricultural technologies and farming system reforms in some areas under different types of land and different farming habits. In the publicity of spring plowing and preparation for plowing, this newspaper emphasized in its editorials that it is necessary to discover and promote the production increase experiences of the masses. It can be seen that these two newspapers, starting from the situation and needs of their provinces, introduce important production increase experiences suitable for various types of regions within the province, which will not only meet the various needs of local farmers, but also guide the people of the province to correctly understand the huge potential in agricultural production.

When publicizing and introducing various agricultural production increase experiences, the Fujian Daily and the Southern Daily also paid attention to criticizing all kinds of right-leaning conservative ideas, which will play a significant role in the rapid promotion of production increase experiences and the rapid development of production increase movements. In Fujian Province, it was originally entirely possible to increase the existing yield of sweet potatoes and rice. However, some people believe that: "It is already very high for Fujian's sweet potatoes to yield 2,000 catties per mu," "There is too little arable land along the coast, the yield is already very high, and it is difficult to increase production," "Although there is a lot of land in the mountainous area, there is insufficient manpower, and it is also difficult to increase production," and so on. In order to overcome these conservative ideas, the Fujian Daily published editorials and articles, using the fact that sweet potatoes in Fuqing County have achieved high yields on various soils to illustrate that as long as various production increase experiences are well promoted, other regions can also achieve increased production. After the newspaper published the experience of large-scale sweet potato production increase in Fuqing County and the experience of Jianyang County in the northern Fujian mountainous area increasing production by 60% by changing to double-cropping rice, some people no longer doubted that areas without paddy fields could greatly increase production; however, they were still very skeptical about whether plain areas with originally higher yields could greatly increase production. For this reason, the newspaper published a special article and introduced the bumper harvest experience of Longxi County in the plain area, where 30 thousand-catty townships emerged, proving that there is also a huge potential for large-scale production increase in high-yield areas in the plains. In the special article "The Common Experience of Production Increase Models" on February 19, the newspaper cited the fact that production increase models in the province have achieved increased production by improving the soil and increasing land fertility to further break the pessimistic views that "it is impossible to greatly increase production in mountainous areas with thin soil" and "production increase in the plains has already reached its peak." In its recent publicity about agricultural production increase, the Southern Daily criticized the complacent and conservative thinking of some people who believe that Chaoan and Chenghai's bumper harvests are due to particularly good conditions, which they do not have. In editorials and articles, the newspaper particularly pointed out that the reason why Chaoan was able to achieve a county-wide thousand-catty bumper harvest under the conditions of rare drought and other natural disasters, and why many fields in Chenghai County were able to change from "three harvests in ten years" before liberation to the current "bumper harvests every season" is entirely the result of the creative labor of the county's farmers under the leadership of the Party and the government, building water conservancy projects and improving farming techniques. The newspaper also combined the past lessons of the Xuwen County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China in not paying attention to summarizing and promoting the county's high-yield bumper harvest experiences, and published articles opposing the conservative thinking of leading cadres who cannot see new things.

Newspapers are a powerful weapon for building socialism, and therefore publicizing and promoting advanced experiences in agricultural production increase should be its regular task. Recently, in addition to the Fujian Daily and the Southern Daily, many newspapers have also paid attention to publicity in this area. However, there are also some newspapers that, when the mass production upsurge comes, only generally talk about the significance of learning advanced production increase experiences, and do not vigorously publicize the production increase experiences that have already been discovered locally. This situation needs to be improved quickly.

### 宣传农业大面积增产经验

    宣传农业大面积增产经验
    刘凯
    随着农业合作化高潮，全国出现了农业生产高潮。为了适应生产高潮的需要，各地报纸应当大力介绍各种农业增产经验特别是大面积增产经验，以鼓舞群众增产的信心，教给群众增产办法。在这方面，福建日报和南方日报已经有了良好的开端。
    福建省的主要粮食作物是番薯和水稻，这两种原都是高产作物，可是由于福建省耕作技术落后和其他原因，这两种作物的产量都不高：番薯平均每亩只产1，300多斤，水稻每亩280多斤。福建日报针对上述情况，大力宣传了福清县有400多亩番薯地采用了东营乡的“大畦密植”增产经验，普遍得到增产，最高产量每亩13，000多斤，平均产量每亩1万斤。福建日报还介绍了闽北山区建阳县改单季稻为双季稻普遍增产6成的经验及其他地区的经验。南方日报也很注意介绍农业增产的经验。近两个多月来，南方日报除发表了全国第一个千斤县潮安县和澄海县农民大力兴修水利，战胜各种自然灾害和全面进行农业技术改革达到全县千斤丰产的经验以外，还介绍了有些地区在不同类型的土地和不同耕作习惯的条件下，进行各种不同农业技术和耕作制度改革的成功事例和好的经验。这个报纸在宣传春耕、备耕工作当中，又在社论中强调指出要发现和推广群众中的增产经验。可以看出，这两个报纸从本省的情况和需要出发，来介绍适合于省内各类地区的重要的增产经验，既会满足当地农民的各方面的需要，又能引导本省人民正确认识农业生产中的巨大潜力。
    福建日报和南方日报在宣传和介绍各种农业增产经验的时候，还注意对形形色色的右倾保守思想进行了批判，这对于增产经验的迅速推广和增产运动的迅速展开，都将起着重大的作用。在福建省，提高番薯和水稻的现有产量，本来是完全可能的。可是有些人却认为：“福建的番薯一亩收两千斤，已经很高了”、“沿海耕地太少，产量已很高，难以增产”、“山区土地虽多，但人力不足，也难以提高产量”，等等。为了克服这些保守思想，福建日报发表社论和文章，通过福清县番薯在各种土壤上都得到高额增产的事实，说明了只要很好地推广各种增产经验，其他地区同样能够得到增产。报纸发表了福清县番薯大面积增产的经验和闽北山区建阳县改种双季稻增产6成的经验以后，有些人对没有水田的地区能够大量增产已没有疑问；可是对于本来产量较高的平原地区是否能大量增产，却仍然很怀疑。报纸为此发表专论和介绍了平原区龙溪县出现30个千斤乡的丰产经验，证明在平原高产地区，同样存在着大量增产的巨大可能性。在2月19日的专论“增产模范们共同的经验”中，报纸又举出本省增产模范通过改良土壤，提高土地肥力获得增产的事实，来进一步打破“山区土薄无法大量增产”、“平原增产已经到顶”的悲观论调。南方日报近来在关于农业增产的宣传中，批判了有些人认为潮安、澄海丰产是由于条件特别好，自己这里没有这些条件的自满保守思想。报纸在社论和文章中特别指出，潮安所以能在少有的旱灾和其他自然灾害条件下获得全县千斤丰产，以及澄海县的许多田所以能从解放前的“十年三收”变成现在的“造造丰收”，完全是全县农民在党和政府领导下，兴修水利改良耕作技术等创造性劳动的结果。报纸还结合中共徐闻县委过去不重视总结和推广县里的高额丰产经验的教训，发表文章，反对领导干部中看不见新鲜事物的保守思想。
    报纸是建设社会主义的强大武器，因而宣传和推广农业增产的先进经验，就应该是它的经常的任务。近来除了福建日报、南方日报以外，不少报纸也都注意了这方面的宣传。可是也有一些报纸，在群众性的生产热潮到来的时候，还只是一般地谈论学习先进增产经验的意义，没有大力宣传当地已经发现的增产经验，这种状况是需要迅速改进的。
