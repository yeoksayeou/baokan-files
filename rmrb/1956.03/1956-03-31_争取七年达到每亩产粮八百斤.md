Strive to Achieve 800 Jin of Grain per Mu in Seven Years
By Our Reporter Lin Li

In the exhibition hall number one of the Guangdong Agricultural Production Exhibition held in Guangzhou on February 24th, there was a bright and eye-catching banner. It read: "Strive to Create More High-Yield Grain Counties Producing 1,000 Jin per Mu." Below the banner were displays of grains, charts, and models from Chao'an, Chenghai, and other places. The numbers on these charts and models showed that before this year, Guangdong already had three counties producing 1,000 jin per mu, thirty-four districts producing 1,000 jin per mu, 505 townships producing 1,000 jin per mu, and 915 agricultural cooperatives producing 1,000 jin per mu. Guangdong's total grain output has risen from the pre-liberation peak annual output of 16 billion jin to 22 billion jin. Due to the continuous increase in grain production, Guangdong has changed from the situation of lacking grain for three months every year in the past and now has surplus grain to support national industrial construction.

People cheered for Guangdong's achievements in grain production. At the same time, they were also excited about Guangdong's future agricultural production plan. In front of many exhibits in the exhibition hall, there was a "Seven-Year Grain Production Plan Chart." This chart stated that the unit area yield of grain crops in Guangdong is currently an average of 422 jin per mu, and in seven years, that is, by the autumn of 1962, it will be increased to an average of 800 jin per mu. That is to say, Guangdong can achieve the grain production target stipulated in the draft "National Agricultural Development Program" in seven years.

The unit area yield of grain crops in Guangdong was relatively low before liberation, and now it is only 422 jin. Is it possible to increase it to 800 jin in seven years?

Many exhibits at the exhibition answered this question affirmatively.

Four sets of drawings and four exhibition stands introduced examples of high-yield models in several different regions of Guangdong. The hometown of Wang Hanguo, a national people's congress representative and agricultural labor model, in Jieyang County near the east coast, is a place close to the mountains, and its production conditions are relatively poor in Guangdong. However, the agricultural cooperative led by Wang Hanguo reached an average yield of 847 jin of grain per mu as early as 1954. Last year, it suffered a drought that had not been seen in many years, but because they actively fought the drought, the output not only did not decrease, but increased by 20% compared to the previous year.

The famous rice high-yield model, Lin Yancheng, lives in Guangdong's famous high-yield grain area. In 1951, he created the national record for double-cropping rice with a yield of 1,622 jin per mu. Because he adhered to his own production experience, there was not much progress in production before last year. Later, with the help of the local Party committee and the People's Government, the Yunguang Agricultural Cooperative he led carried out several technical reforms in succession and adopted the excellent varieties "Shi Shi Qian" and "Nante No. 16." In this way, the unit area yield last year increased to 2,012 jin, creating a new national record for high-yield rice.

Liu Sielie from Guanbu Township, Chaoyang County, is also a rice high-yield model. The yield of the agricultural cooperative he belongs to has remained above 1,200 jin for several years.

The yield of the Duowen Agricultural Production Cooperative in Lingao County, Hainan Island, is particularly noteworthy. Because it is a low-yield area, many lands are still cultivated using primitive farming methods. Last year, this cooperative only adopted the advanced cultivation method of close planting with small seedlings, and 63 mu of rice obtained a high yield of an average of 640 jin per mu. Among them, the 1.2 mu of high-yield land reached a yield of 1,569 jin, creating the highest record in Hainan Island.

The model deeds of Wang Hanguo, Lin Yancheng, Liu Sielie, and Duowen Cooperative not only show that the plains and high-yield areas of Guangdong can achieve a harvest of more than 1,000 jin, but also that the mountainous and low-yield areas can also achieve a yield of more than 800 jin.

After affirming that it is possible to achieve a yield of 800 jin per mu, many exhibits at the exhibition used many vivid charts, models, and physical objects to explain the work to be done to achieve 800 jin. This work is a summary of the experience of the past few years and an effective method to increase grain production. To sum up, there are five reforms.

The first reform is called "changing single cropping to double cropping." Guangdong is located in the subtropics, with a warm climate and abundant rainfall, and crops can generally be harvested three times a year. However, until today, many lands that can be harvested three times have not been fully utilized. The charts at the exhibition show that before and after the land reform, Guangdong had 8.64 million mu of single-cropping land, that is to say, land that could have been planted for two or three harvests was only planted for one harvest at that time. In addition, 35 million mu of land that should have been planted for three harvests was only planted for two harvests. In the past two years, people have changed nearly 2 million mu of single-cropping land into double-cropping land, which has increased the grain output by 3 million dan. In the past few years, Guangdong Province has also done a lot of work in expanding winter crops and has achieved many results. The charts at the exhibition show that Guangdong only had 9 million mu of winter crops in 1952, but it rose to 14 million mu in 1954. The achievements in 1955 were the greatest, reaching 18 million mu, accounting for more than half of the land area that can be planted in winter. People calculated the 5 million mu of wheat in this area, and with a minimum harvest of 100 jin per mu, it can increase the wheat output by 500 million jin.

The second reform is called "changing 'zheng gao' to plowing and tilling," which is commonly referred to as "intercropping to continuous cropping." This is proposed for the sandy fields in the Pearl River Delta. If the land here can be used reasonably, it can generally harvest 2,000 jin of rice per mu. However, in the past, the farmers here adopted the backward "zheng gao system," and each mu of land only harvested 300 to 400 jin. From the paintings and their explanations, people saw that in a "zheng gao" rice field, sparse early rice was growing, and the rice seedlings had not yet sprouted, and late rice was planted between its rows. In the middle, no weeding or fertilization was done, and early rice was harvested in July, and late rice was harvested in November. After the land reform, although people put a lot of effort into the "zheng gao system" fields, the yield per mu did not exceed 500 jin. In the fields that were changed to "plowing and tilling," the early rice adopted the advanced method of close planting with small seedlings, and the seedlings were dense and green. After the early rice was harvested in July, plowing, harrowing, and fertilization were carried out immediately, and then the late rice seedlings were transplanted. Because the early and late rice did not affect each other, they all grew very well. The 515 mu of rice fields of the Taiyangsheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhuhai County had an average yield of only 490 jin of rice when they were "zheng gao" in 1954. In 1955, after being changed to "plowing and tilling," it rose to 736 jin. The chart at the exhibition said that there are 3 million mu of such land in the Pearl River Delta. In the past two years, 720,000 mu have been reformed, thereby increasing rice production by 1.5 million dan. It called on people to change all "zheng gao" land into "plowing and tilling" in three or two years.

The third reform is called "changing sowing to transplanting." Sowing is an extensive cultivation method. Farmers casually turned the ground over and sowed the seeds. The seedlings were not separated into rows, there were no ridges, and it was a messy patch. This method is popular in Hainan Island and western Guangdong, covering approximately more than 2.5 million mu. The annual output of rice per mu is only 200 jin. In order to give full play to the potential of the land, Guangdong put forward the slogan of thoroughly reforming sowing as early as two years ago. In the past two years, 520,000 mu of land have been changed from sowing to transplanting, increasing rice production by 360,000 dan.

The fourth reform is called promoting improved varieties. On the exhibition stand, dozens of carefully selected seeds were displayed. These seeds have been proven by local experiments to generally increase grain production by 10% compared to local native varieties, and some can increase the yield by 20% or 30%. As far as double-cropping rice is concerned, it is better to promote "Nante No. 16" for early rice, and "Bai Ke Ai" yields the most for late rice. Chao'an, Chenghai, and Chaoyang were able to become China's first batch of high-yield grain counties producing 1,000 jin per mu, and one of the important reasons is that they used improved varieties in large quantities. The experience of these places proves that the promotion of improved varieties requires the support and help of the government. At the same time, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to discover good varieties. One bunch of short-stemmed, hard-branched rice seeds on display was brought back from North Korea by Du Meizong, a labor model from Chenghai County, when he participated in the Chinese People's Delegation to Comfort the Korean People. People call it "Korean seeds." Its characteristics are good rice quality, fragrant cooked rice, strong resistance to rice blast and cold resistance, and it is not easy to lodge. Du Meizong planted 7.5 mu in Tucheng Township where he lives, with an average yield of 711 jin per mu, which is 151 jin higher than "Nante No. 16" under the same conditions. Many good varieties that can be promoted have also been found in the native varieties in various regions. However, at present, the area for promoting improved varieties in the province is only one-sixth, and further efforts are still needed.

The fifth reform is called soil improvement. There are many examples of soil improvement, and the content is the richest. Before soil improvement was carried out at the State-owned Kuitan Farm, the soil there was dry and hard, and the color was light yellow. One mu of land only harvested 250 jin of rice a year. After improvement, the color of the soil became reddish-brown and black, soft and loose, and somewhat moist. The yield per mu was as high as 1,400 jin. The main method of soil improvement is to apply a large amount of native miscellaneous fertilizer and human and animal manure. In order to vigorously promote soil improvement, the experience of the Fucheng Farm in Lingshan County in "returning rice straw to the field" is also introduced here. The model diagram said that the farmland of Fucheng Farm used to be yellow mud land, and it could not be distributed during the land reform. This kind of land is "sticky like glue when there is water, and hard as stone when there is no water." The farm accepted this unwanted land and used the method of "returning rice straw to the field" to improve the soil, combined with other technical reforms. Over the years, the soil quality has changed and the yield has increased. By 1955, each mu harvested 1,100 jin of grain. Fucheng Farm has become the first 1,000-jin farm in the Qinzhou area. This method of soil improvement by "returning rice straw to the field" is the simplest and easiest to promote. It is only necessary to cut off the upper part when cutting rice, leaving the lower part, and then use plows and harrows to turn the remaining rice straw under the soil.

In addition to these five reforms, the exhibition also displayed exhibits such as agricultural tool reform, disaster prevention and insect control, elimination of "four pests", and turning dry land into paddy fields. The exhibits show that these are the fundamental measures to ensure the realization of the above-mentioned five reforms and to increase the yield per unit area.

    争取七年达到每亩产粮八百斤
    本报记者　林里
    二月二十四日在广州举行的广东省农业生产展览会第一馆的陈列室里，有一幅鲜艳夺目的横额。上面写着：为创造更多的粮食千斤丰产县而奋斗。横额的下边，陈设着来自潮安、澄海等地的谷物、图表和模型。这些图表和模型上的数字表明：广东在今年以前，已经有三个千斤县，三十四个千斤区，505个千斤乡，915个千斤社。广东省的粮食总产量，已经由解放前最高年产量的160亿斤，上升为220亿斤。因为粮食生产的不断提高，广东省改变了从前每年缺粮三个月的情况，而且有余粮支援国家工业建设了。
    人们为广东省的粮食生产成就而欢呼。同时，也为广东省的农业生产的未来计划而兴奋。在展览馆的许多展览品的前头，挂着一张“七年粮食生产规划图”。这张图表上说，广东的粮食作物单位面积产量，现在是平均每亩422斤，七年以后，即到1962年秋，要提高到每亩平均八百斤。就是说，广东可以七年实现“全国农业发展纲要”草案上所规定的粮食生产指标。
    广东省粮食作物的单位面积产量，解放前是比较低的，现在也不过422斤，要在七年内提高到八百斤，这是可能的吗？
    展览会的许多展品，肯定地回答了这个问题。
    有四组画图和四座展台，介绍了广东几种不同地区的丰产模范事例。全国人民代表大会的代表农业劳动模范汪汉国的家乡靠近东海岸的揭阳县，是接近山区的一个地方，生产条件在广东来说是比较差的。但是在汪汉国领导的农业合作社，早在1954年就达到了平均每亩收谷847斤。去年，遭到了多年不遇的旱灾，但是由于他们积极抗旱，产量不仅没有减少，反比前年增加了20％。
    著名的水稻丰产模范林炎城，住在广东出名的粮食高产区。他在1951年创造了双季稻每亩产稻1，622斤的全国最高纪录。因为墨守自己的生产经验，去年以前生产没有多大进展。后来，经当地党委和人民政府的帮助，他所领导的云光农业合作社接连进行了几项技术改革，采用了优良品种“十石歉”和“南特16号”，这样，去年的单位面积产量就提高到2，012斤，又创造了全国水稻丰产最高纪录。
    潮阳县关埠乡的刘赛烈，也是水稻丰产模范。他所在的农业合作社的产量，几年来一直保持在一千二百斤以上。
    海南岛临高县多文农业生产合作社的产量特别引人注意。因为那里是低产区，许多土地还是用原始的耕作方法耕种的。去年这个社仅仅采用了小株密植这项先进耕作法，六十三亩水稻就获得了每亩平均640斤的高额产量。其中的1.2亩丰产田，产量达1，569斤，创造了海南岛的最高纪录。
    汪汉国、林炎城、刘赛烈和多文社的模范事迹，不光说明广东的平原区和高产区能够获得千斤以上的收成，就是山区和低产区也能达到八百斤以上的产量。
    展览会的许多展品，在肯定了可以达到每亩产量八百斤以后，就用许多生动的图表、模型和实物，说明达到八百斤所要做的工作。这些工作，是以往几年的经验总结，是增产粮食的有效方法。概括起来就是五项改革。
    第一项改革叫做“单造改双造”。广东地处亚热带，气候温暖，雨量充足，农作物一般都能一年三收。可是直到今天，许多能够三收的土地并没有得到充分利用。展览会的图表表明：在土地改革前后，广东有864万亩单造田，就是说，本来能种二收或三收的土地，那时只是种一收。此外，有三千五百万亩应该种三收的土地只种二收。近两年来，人们把将近二百万亩的单造田改成了双造田，就增加了三百万担粮食。这几年来，广东省在扩大冬种作物方面也做了许多工作，并且获得了不少成绩。展览会的图表表明：1952年广东才有九百万亩冬季作物，到1954年就上升到一千四百万亩了，1955年的成绩最大，已经达一千八百万亩，占可以冬种土地面积的一半以上。人们把这当中的五百万亩小麦计算了一下，以每亩最低收成一百斤，就能增加五亿斤小麦。
    第二项改革叫做“挣藁改翻耕”，也就是通常所说的“间作改连作”。这是针对珠江三角洲的沙田地区提出的。这里的土地如果能够合理利用，一般每亩可以收获二千斤稻谷。但是以往这里的农民采用了落后的“挣藁制”，每亩土地只收三百斤到四百斤。从图画和它的说明上，人们看到：在一块“挣藁”的稻田里，稀稀拉拉的早稻在生长，禾苗还没有吐穗，就在它的行距之间插上了晚稻。这中间，不锄草，不施肥，等到七月收早稻，等到十一月收晚禾。土地改革以后，人们在实行“挣藁制”田里虽然费了好多劲，每亩产量也没有超过五百斤。在改为“翻耕”的田里，早稻采用了先进的小株密植方法，禾苗又密又青。七月收割了早稻，紧接着就犁、耙、施肥，然后才插晚稻的秧苗，因为早晚稻互不影响，全都长得很好。珠海县太阳升农业生产合作社的515亩水稻田，1954年“挣藁”的时候，平均产量只有490斤稻谷。1955年改为“翻耕”，就上升到736斤了。展览会的图表上说，珠江三角洲有这样的土地三百万亩。过去的两年改革了七十二万亩，从而增产了稻谷150万担。它号召人们在三、二年内，把所有的“挣藁”地全都改成为“翻耕”。
    第三项改革叫做“撒播改插秧”。撒播是一种粗放的耕作方法。农民们随便把地翻一翻就撒下了种籽。禾苗不分行，没有垅，乱杂杂的一大片。这种方法流行在海南岛和粤西等地，占地大约250万多亩。每亩年产稻谷不过二百斤。为了发挥土地潜力，广东早在两年前就提出了彻底改革撒播的口号。近二年来，撒播改插秧的土地达到五十二万亩，增产了三十六万担稻谷。
    第四项改革叫做推广优良品种。展台上，摆着几十种经过精选的种籽。这些种籽经过各地试验证明一般都比当地土种增产粮食10％，有的能提高产量20％或30％。就双季稻来说，早稻以推广“南特16号”为好，晚稻用“白壳矮”收获最多。潮安、澄海和潮阳，能够成为我国的第一批粮食千斤丰产县，重要原因之一就是他们大量地采用了优良品种。这些地方的经验证明，推广优良品种要有政府的支持和帮助，同时，要发动群众去发现良种。这次展出的有一束秆短、枝硬的稻种，是澄海县的劳动模范杜美宗，在参加中国人民赴朝慰问团的时候，从朝鲜带回来的。人们叫它“朝鲜种”。它的特点是米质好，煮饭香，抵抗稻热病和抗寒能力强，又不容易倒伏。杜美宗在他所在的涂城乡试种了7.5亩，平均每亩收谷711斤，比同样条件下的“南特16号”还高151斤。在各个地区的土种中，也发现了不少可以推广的良种。但是目前全省推广良种面积才只有六分之一，还需要继续努力。
    第五项改革叫做改良土壤。改良土壤的实例很多，内容也最丰富。国营葵谭农场在没有进行土壤改良以前，那里的土又干又硬，颜色是浅黄的。一亩地一年只收二百五十斤稻谷。经过改良以后，土的颜色变成了褐红，乌黑，又软又松，还多少带点湿气。每亩地的产量高达一千四百斤。改良土壤的主要办法是大量施放土杂肥和人畜肥。为了大力推行土壤改良，这里还介绍了灵山县附城农场的“稻秆回田”的经验。模型图上说，附城农场的耕地过去是黄泥地，土地改革时候分都分不出去。这种地“有水粘似胶，无水硬如石”。农场接受了这种没有人要的地，用“稻秆回田”的办法改良土壤，结合进行其他技术改革，几年来，土质变样了，产量提高了，到1955年，每亩收谷一千一百斤。附城农场就成了钦州地区第一个千斤农场。这种“稻秆回田”的土壤改良办法最简单，最容易推行。它只是在割稻子的时候，割去上半部，留下下半部，然后用犁耙把留下的稻秆翻到土下就行了。
    在这五项改革之外，展览会还展出了农具改革、防灾防虫和消灭“四害”、变旱地为水田等展览品。展品说明这些都是保证实现上面说的五项改革提高单位面积产量的根本措施。
