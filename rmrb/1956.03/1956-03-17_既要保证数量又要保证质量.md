    Both Quantity and Quality Must Be Guaranteed
    Xu Yao
    In order to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and surpass the quotas, and to meet the needs of the rapid development of national socialist construction, the Harbin Linen Factory in Heilongjiang Province recently mobilized its workers to comprehensively plan the factory's production and administrative work. The Party Committee strengthened its leadership in the planning, repeatedly criticized the right-leaning conservative ideas among the cadres, and fully mobilized the masses to tap potential. As a result, all production targets for 1956 are higher than those proposed by the state. Calculated based on the total annual output, the Five-Year Plan can be completed one year and two months ahead of schedule, an increase of 55.68% compared to the actual output in 1955, exceeding the Five-Year Plan level by 30.8%. The total output value is 24.5% higher than the 1956 state plan. In terms of product quality, the annual average of first-class bleached cloth and raw-colored cloth reached 99.81% (the state plan for first-class products was 99%); labor productivity increased by 12.11% compared to the actual level in 1955; the total annual planned cost reduction rate was 5.25%, 31.7% lower than in 1955. To accomplish the above targets, the factory also proposed relatively specific measures in various aspects.
    The planning work of the Harbin Linen Factory was carried out under the direct leadership of the factory's Party Committee. After listening to the factory director's transmission of the guidelines and tasks determined by the Ministry of Textile Industry's factory director conference, the Party Committee instructed the administrative leadership to quickly propose requirements and measures to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and organized a factory-wide broadcast meeting to convey the instructions from higher authorities. At the meeting, the factory director made a mobilization report on completing the Five-Year Plan one year and two months ahead of schedule, put forward the conditions for responding to the call of the Beijing No. 1 Cotton Mill to launch an inter-factory competition, and rewarded some advanced producers. Subsequently, the entire factory's staff listened to the Harbin Municipal Party Committee's mobilization broadcast on completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. All of this greatly encouraged the workers, who expressed their commitment to ensure the completion of the Five-Year Plan one year and two months ahead of schedule. However, at the same time, the Party Committee found that middle-level and above cadres lacked confidence in completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and there was significant ideological resistance. Some people believed that the original plan was already very advanced, and further planning would not reveal much more potential; some emphasized that the equipment utilization rate had reached the highest standard in the Soviet design specifications, and some had even exceeded it; some one-sidedly emphasized that machine equipment could not be changed arbitrarily and new products could not be trial-produced. In addition, some people were impatient, attempting to produce a very large number in one week.
    The Party Committee believed that the reason why these comrades one-sidedly emphasized unfavorable factors and difficult conditions was mainly due to their serious complacency, believing that their work had already been done very well, the output was already very high, the quality had reached the standard, and the level of management work had also improved significantly, and they were often praised by the higher Party Committee and the Textile Bureau. Therefore, they were content with the status quo, complacent, not actively relying on the masses of workers, and rarely consulted with the masses about matters. Although the factory had a system of inspecting workshops, cadres often failed to discover problems, and their understanding of the situation was superficial. For example, it generally takes 30 to 45 minutes to load 401 cloth onto a shaft, while the Wang Zhenmao team only takes 14 to 15 minutes (the quota is 30 minutes). Generally, each machine produces 65-67 meters of cloth per day, but many workers in the Wang Zhenmao team can weave 70 meters, or even 76 meters. The cadres only knew that the reason why this team was able to improve production efficiency was because the preparation work was done well, but they did not understand exactly how it was prepared, so they could not promote backward workers to learn from advanced workers. Under the control of this complacent and detached-from-the-masses ideological style, many cadres adopted an overly cautious attitude towards formulating plans, and some things that could be done, or even had already been done, were not included in the plan. For example, the elimination of "big-belly yarn" was once achieved in 1954, but the plan proposed that it could only be eliminated in the second half of 1956. For the trial production of new products, some varieties (such as printed and dyed calico) could be successfully trial-produced early to meet the needs of the summer market, but it was also planned to only formally put them into production in July or August.
    It is impossible to formulate an advanced plan without overcoming the above-mentioned right-leaning conservative ideas. Therefore, the Party Committee of the Harbin Linen Factory first convened a plenary meeting of the Party Committee, where each member analyzed and criticized the right-leaning conservative ideas. Afterwards, the Party Committee gave a report at a meeting of cadres at the level of foremen and above, and distributed the draft plan to solicit opinions, extensively carrying out top-down inspections and bottom-up criticisms. In the process of carrying out these tasks, the Party Committee closely relied on the masses, conducted in-depth investigations and research, and used facts to break down conservative ideas. For example, the director of the weaving workshop believed that if the speed of the machines was increased, the quality would inevitably decrease; however, when studying with the workers, the workers believed that there was no problem in increasing the speed of the canvas machine from 140 revolutions to 150 revolutions. After the experiment, the effect was good, and the machine ran normally. The director of the yarn workshop also initially believed that increasing the speed of the machines would not work; but after seeing the workers' on-site operation experiment, he said: "There is no problem in increasing the speed of the roving frame from 700 revolutions to 750 revolutions, and it can even be increased to 800 revolutions after the workers become skilled in operation." Other issues, such as opening three shifts earlier and expanding the number of machines looked after by workers, were also resolved in the same way.
    After breaking down conservative ideas with facts and conducting extensive and in-depth propaganda and education, the socialist enthusiasm of the workers quickly surged. Not only did the vast majority of workers propose targets that exceeded the numbers stipulated by the factory's administrative leadership; but also many measures to improve production and increase efficiency had been mastered by the workers. The cloth workshop has increased from two people watching one machine to one person watching three to four machines, and automatic cloth machines have increased from one person watching 14 machines to 20 machines. The workers also launched a wave of learning new technologies, and both new and old workers revised their contracts for teaching and learning, striving to complete the task of imparting and learning new technologies ahead of schedule.
    However, at this time, the Party Committee found that cadres and the masses both showed a phenomenon of greed for quantity and speed, neglecting quality and thrift, and the quality of some products had begun to decline, and the consumption of raw materials had begun to increase. For example, in the yarn workshop, the first-class product rate in December of last year was 68%, while the first-class product rate from January 1st to 21st of this year was only 50.8%; in the cloth workshop, the product quality in the fourth quarter of last year was 99.6%, while it was 99.4% from January 1st to 17th of this year. Therefore, in the later stage, the Party Committee paid special attention to the issue of quality. After analysis and research, the Party Committee believed that the occurrence of quality problems, in addition to indicating that the right-leaning conservative ideas among the cadres had not been completely overcome, the daily technical guidance work was weak, there was a lack of specific measures to solve quality problems, the summarization and promotion of workers' advanced operating methods were insufficient, and the handling of rationalization proposals was not timely enough, were also very important reasons. Therefore, in addition to arranging for each branch to further inspect and criticize right-leaning conservative ideas, the Party Committee also paid attention to mobilizing the masses to put forward specific measures to solve quality problems in the first quarter of this year, so that the quality of some products quickly improved. At the same time, in order to thoroughly realize the requirements of the plan, the Party Committee also instructed the Party organizations of each branch and unit: they should assist the administrative leadership in carrying out the planning of their own units according to the content and requirements of the overall factory plan, mobilize the masses of workers to revise and enrich their own plans; they should sign collective contracts and carry out regular socialist labor competitions; they should strengthen technical guidance and rapidly improve the technical level of workers. In these several aspects, the Party Committee put forward some matters that should be paid attention to, and stipulated some specific requirements and measures.

    既要保证数量又要保证质量

    黑龙江省哈尔滨亚麻厂为了提前和超额完成五年计划，以适应国家社会主义建设迅速发展的需要，最近发动职工群众对全厂的生产和行政工作进行了全面规划。党委在规划中加强了领导，反复地批判了干部中的右倾保守思想，充分发动群众挖掘了潜力，因而1956年的各项生产指标都较国家所提出的高。按全年的总产量计算，可以提前一年两个多月完成五年计划，比1955年的实际产量提高55.68％，超过五年计划水平30.8％。总产值比1956年国家计划提高24.5％。产品质量方面，漂白布和原色布的一等品全年平均达到99.81％（国家计划一等品为99％）；劳动生产率比1955年实际提高12.11％；全年计划总成本降低率为5.25％，比1955年降低额为31.7％。为了完成上述的各项指标，该厂还从各个方面提出了较为具体的措施。
    哈尔滨亚麻厂的规划工作，是在这个厂的党委的直接领导下进行的。党委在听取厂长传达中央纺织工业部厂长会议确定的方针任务以后，即责成行政领导部门迅速提出提前完成五年计划的要求和措施，并且组织了全厂的广播大会传达上级指示。会上，厂长作了提前一年两个月完成五年计划的动员报告，提出了响应北京国棉一厂开展厂际竞赛号召的条件，并且奖励了一些先进生产者。接着，又组织全厂职工收听了中共哈尔滨市委提前完成五年计划的动员广播。所有这些，都使职工群众受到很大的鼓舞，他们纷纷表示要保证提前一年两个月完成五年计划。但是，就在这同时，党委发现中层以上的干部对提前完成五年计划的信心不足，思想阻力很大。有的人认为原来的计划已经很先进，再规划也规划不出多大潜力；有的人强调设备利用率已达到苏联设计说明书的最高标准，个别的已经超过；有的人片面强调机器装置不能随意改变，不能试制新产品。此外，也还有一些人有急躁情绪，企图用一周时间搞出个很大的数字。
    党委认为，这些同志所以片面地强调不利因素和困难条件，主要是这些人有严重的骄傲自满情绪，以为自己的工作已经做得很好，产量已经很高，质量达到了标准，管理工作的水平也提高了不少，并且经常得到上级党委和纺织部和局的表扬。因此他们就安于现状，自命不凡，不积极依靠职工群众，有事很少同群众商量。虽然工厂订有巡视车间的制度，但是干部常常发现不了问题，对情况的了解是知其然而不知其所以然。例如，401布每上一次轴，一般需要30分到45分钟，而王振茂小组却只用14到15分钟（定额是30分钟）。一般地，每天每台机器出产65——67公尺布，而王振茂小组却有不少工人能织70公尺，甚至76公尺。这个小组为什么能够提高生产效率，干部只知道是准备工作做得好，但是究竟是怎样准备的，他们就不甚了解，因而也就不能推动落后工人向先进工人学习。在这种安于现状和脱离群众的思想作风的支配之下，不少干部对制定规划抱着过于慎重的态度，有些本来可以做到的、甚至已经做到的事情，他们也不敢放到规划中去。例如消灭大肚纱，1954年就有一度作到了，而在规划中却提出1956年下半年才能消灭。试制新产品，有的品种（如印染花布）能提早试制成功，以满足夏季市场的需要，但也计划在七、八月才正式投入生产。
    上述的右倾保守思想不克服，要想订出先进的规划是不可能的。因此，哈尔滨亚麻厂党委首先召开了党委全体会议，由各委员对右倾保守思想作了分析批判。之后，党委又在工长以上的干部会上作了报告，并且把规划草案发下去征求意见，广泛地开展了自上而下的检查和自下而上的批评。在进行这些工作的过程中，党委紧紧地依靠群众，深入进行调查研究，用事实打破保守思想。如织布场主任认为，如果提高机台的转速，就非降低质量不可；但是在和工人研究的时候，工人却认为帆布机由140转提高到150转根本没有问题。试验以后，效果良好，机器运转正常。纱场主任最初也认为提高机器转速不行；但看到工人实地操作试验以后，就说：“粗纱机由700转提高到750转没有问题，而且在工人的操作熟练后，还可以提高到800转。”其他问题，如提早开三班，扩大工人看管机台的数量等，也是用同样方法解决的。
    在用事实打破了保守思想，并且广泛深入地进行宣传教育以后，职工群众的社会主义积极性迅速高涨起来。不但绝大多数工人提出的指标，超过了该厂行政领导部门规定的数字；而且许多改进生产、提高效率的措施已经为职工群众所掌握。布场已由两个人看一台机器增加到一人看三台到四台，自动布机由一人看14台扩大到20台。职工们还掀起了学习新技术的热潮，新老工人都修改了包教包学合同，争取提前完成传授和学习新技术的任务。
    但在这个时候，党委却发现干部和群众中都出现了贪多图快、忽视好和省的现象，并且若干产品的质量已经开始下降，原材料的消耗开始增加。如纱场，去年12月份的一等品是68％，而今年1月1日到21日的一等品仅达到50.8％；布场，去年第四季度的产品质量是99.6％，而今年1月1日到17日是99.4％。因此，在后一阶段，党委特别注意了质量问题。党委经过分析研究以后认为，质量问题的产生，除说明干部中的右倾保守思想没有彻底克服以外，日常的技术指导工作薄弱，缺乏解决质量问题的具体措施，对工人的先进操作方法总结推广不够，对合理化建议的处理不够及时，也是很重要的原因。因此，党委除了布置各支部进一步检查批判右倾保守思想以外，还注意发动群众提出今年第一季度解决质量问题的具体措施，使若干产品的质量很快就有了提高。同时，党委为了彻底实现规划的要求，还指示各分场和各单位的党组织：应按照总厂规划的内容和要求，协助行政领导部门进行本单位的规划，发动职工群众修正和充实自己的规划；要签订集体合同，开展经常性的社会主义劳动竞赛；要加强技术指导，迅速提高工人的技术水平。在这几个方面，党委都提出了一些应注意的事项，规定了一些具体的要求和措施。
