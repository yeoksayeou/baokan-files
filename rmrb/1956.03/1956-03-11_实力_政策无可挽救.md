Title: The "Strength" Policy is Beyond Redemption

The Manila Treaty Organization Council meeting in Karachi has concluded. The American aggressor group originally hoped to use this meeting to change its situation in Southeast Asia and salvage the failure of its "strength" policy in the region. The facts show that this plan was a complete failure.

According to reports in the American newspapers before the meeting, the American diplomatic authorities attached great importance to this meeting. The Karachi meeting was given the "mission" of opposing the policy of peaceful coexistence pursued by most Asian countries, taking various measures to "strengthen" this military alliance to curb the increasingly obvious centrifugal tendencies within the Manila Treaty Organization, and further "arming the treaty with teeth" to threaten the People's Republic of China and other major Asian countries.

However, today's situation in Asia determines the inevitable bankruptcy of these schemes of the American aggressor group. The characteristics of the current Asian situation are: the increasing role of the "Bandung Spirit" in international affairs, the widespread recognition of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence among Asian countries, and the further growth of friendship between China, the Soviet Union, and Asian countries. Anyone who tries to go against the tide in the face of this situation is bound to suffer a shameful defeat. Therefore, even though Dulles wantonly slandered the peaceful policies of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China at the Karachi meeting, and repeatedly emphasized that "we must mainly rely on the deterrent effect of strategic strength," trying to form the organization into a so-called military alliance with "strength," his vigorous advocacy of the "strength" policy did not resonate widely among the member states of the Manila Treaty. At the Karachi meeting, representatives of many countries more or less acknowledged that the situation in Asia had eased compared to a year ago, although they were unwilling to point out that this was the result of the joint efforts of peaceful countries such as the Soviet Union, China, and India. French Foreign Minister Pineau also said that the coexistence of the two systems is inevitable for a long period of time in the future. During the meeting, a spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry stated that Japan had "no direct interest" in the Manila Treaty Organization. Thus, the American "strength" policy is not only in a completely isolated position in front of all peace-loving countries and people in the world, but also cannot obtain complete support within the military bloc it cobbled together and among its so-called "allies."

In order to conceal the essence of the Manila Treaty Organization as a military alliance, and to cater to the opinions of the majority of member states in exchange for their support for the American military threat policy, the United States also proclaimed that it would increase "economic activity" in the region. However, the American so-called economic activity in backward areas has always been to squeeze out its Western allies and control the economic lifeline of backward countries. This intention of the United States is obviously in conflict with the interests of other Western countries. This made it impossible for the Karachi meeting to reach a consensus on specific measures.

The Karachi meeting most clearly showed how unpopular the Manila Treaty Organization, pieced together by the United States, is. However, what should arouse people's vigilance is that the United States has not yet abandoned its plan to use this military bloc to serve its aggressive policies. The Manila Treaty is still a tool for the United States to intensify the tense situation in Asia.

The communiqué of the Karachi meeting continued to advocate the establishment and maintenance of "strong deterrent forces." This military group also wants to establish a so-called "research work center" in Bangkok to intensify espionage and subversion activities. People know that the Thai people and Thai public opinion are increasingly opposed to American oppression of Thailand; Pakistani public opinion believes that "Western capitalist countries only use these treaties (Manila Treaty, etc.) to serve their own power politics." Obviously, these activities that the United States wants to carry out are not only aimed at other peace-loving countries in Asia, but also primarily targeted at Asian countries within the Manila Treaty group. It is worth noting that the Karachi meeting even attempted to openly interfere in the affairs of Asian countries, creating disputes and discord among Asian countries. It should be pointed out that issues such as Kashmir and Pakistan-Afghanistan should be properly and reasonably resolved by the relevant parties through peaceful consultation. The wishes of the people in the relevant regions should be respected. This is in line with the interests of the people of the countries concerned and also in line with the interests of Asian peace and security. The United States' use of the Manila Treaty to interfere arbitrarily is clearly an attempt to impose the command of this military group on countries outside the Manila Treaty, thereby further dividing the unity of Asian countries.

The American conspiracy to use the Manila Treaty to exacerbate the tense situation in Asia has aroused great indignation among Asian countries. The editorial of the "Hindustan Standard" expressed the indignation of the Indian public. It wrote: "The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization has now stood at our door. It can be predicted that this treaty organization and the Baghdad Treaty Organization will cause various disputes and dangers." The Indonesian "People's Daily" pointed out: "As long as the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization exists, the peace and security of Southeast Asia will never be guaranteed."

Now, Dulles has gone to various parts of Asia for "visits" after the end of the Karachi meeting. On the one hand, Dulles is using the Manila Treaty as a "big stick" to intimidate Asian countries inside and outside this military group, sow discord among Asian countries, and heighten international tensions; on the other hand, he is pretending to be a hypocrite, disguising himself as a "friend" of the Asian people. Dulles originally thought that he could change his appearance and engage in swindling; but in the minds of the Asian people, he has become an "ominous bird."

The determination of the Asian people to safeguard peace and strengthen international cooperation is extremely firm. The unity of the Asian people will inevitably cause all the conspiracies of the American aggressor group to fail. The failure of the "strength" policy is beyond redemption.

### “实力”政策无可挽救

    “实力”政策无可挽救
    在喀喇蚩举行的马尼拉条约组织理事会会议，已经闭幕了。美国侵略集团原来指望借助这个会议改变它在东南亚的处境，挽救“实力”政策在这个地区的失败。事实表明这种打算是完全落空了。
    根据美国报纸在会前的报道，美国外交当局对这一会议异常重视。喀喇蚩会议被赋予了这样的“使命”：反对大多数亚洲国家所奉行的和平共处政策，采取各种措施来“加强”这个军事同盟，以制止马尼拉条约组织内部愈益明显的离心倾向，进而“为条约装上牙齿”，以便针对着中华人民共和国和其他亚洲主要国家进行威胁。
    但是，今天亚洲的局势，决定了美国侵略集团这些计谋的必然破产。当前亚洲形势的特点是：“万隆精神”在国际事务中的作用日益增长，和平共处的五项原则在亚洲国家中获得了广泛的承认，中国、苏联和亚洲国家的友谊正在进一步增长。谁想在这种形势的面前逆流而进，它一定要遭到可耻的失败。因此，即使杜勒斯在喀喇蚩会议上肆意污蔑苏联和中华人民共和国的和平政策，一再强调“必须主要依靠战略力量的威慑效果”，想把这个组织形成一个所谓有“实力”的军事联盟，但是他对“实力”政策的卖力鼓吹，并没有在马尼拉条约的成员国中引起广泛的共鸣。在喀喇蚩会议上，不少国家的代表或多或少地承认亚洲的局势已比一年以前有了和缓，尽管他们不愿意指出这是苏联、中国和印度等和平国家共同努力的结果。法国外交部长比诺还说，在今后的长时期内，两种制度的共处是不可避免的。在会议的进行期间，日本外务省发言人表示，日本对马尼拉条约组织“没有直接兴趣”。这样，美国的“实力”政策不仅在全世界爱好和平的国家和人民面前处于完全孤立的境地，而且在它拼凑军事集团内部和所谓“盟国”中间，也并不能获得完全的支持。
    为了掩盖马尼拉条约组织的军事联盟的本质，为了迎合大多数成员国的意见来换取它们支持美国的军事威胁政策，美国也宣扬要增加这个地区的“经济活动”。但是，美国对落后地区的所谓经济活动一向都是要排挤它的西方同盟国和控制落后国家的经济命脉。美国的这种打算显然是和其他西方国家的利益冲突的。这就使得喀喇蚩会议不可能在具体措施上得出一致的意见。
    喀喇蚩会议最清楚不过地表明，由美国一手拼凑的马尼拉条约组织，是多么地不得人心。但是，应该引起人们警惕的是，美国还远没有放弃利用这个军事集团来为它侵略政策服务的打算。马尼拉条约仍然是美国加剧亚洲紧张局势的一个工具。
    喀喇蚩会议的公报继续鼓吹要建立和维持“强大的威慑力量”。这个军事集团还要在曼谷成立所谓“研究工作中心”，以加紧间谍活动和颠复活动。人们知道，泰国人民和泰国舆论越来越反对美国对泰国的压迫；巴基斯坦舆论认为“西方资本主义国家只利用这些条约（马尼拉条约等）为它们自己的强权政治服务。”显然美国所要进行的这些活动不但是针对着亚洲其他爱好和平国家，而且首先就是针对着马尼拉条约集团内部的亚洲国家。值得注意的是喀喇蚩会议竟然企图公开干涉亚洲国家的事务，制造亚洲国家间的纠纷和不和。应该指出，诸如克什米尔和巴克同尼斯坦等问题，由有关的当事国以和平协商的方式求得妥善和合理的解决是合适的。有关地区的人民的愿望理应得到尊重。这样既符合有关国家人民的利益，也符合亚洲和平和安全的利益。美国利用马尼拉条约来横加干涉，明明是想把这个军事集团的号令强加在非马尼拉条约国的头上，借此来进一步分裂亚洲国家的团结。
    美国利用马尼拉条约来加剧亚洲紧张局势的阴谋，已引起了亚洲国家的极大愤慨。“印度斯坦旗报”的社论，表达了印度公众愤慲心绪。它写道：“东南亚条约组织现在已经站到我们门口来了。可以预料，这个条约组织和巴格达条约组织将要引起各种纠纷和危险。”印度尼西亚“人民日报”指出：“只要东南亚条约组织存在一天，东南亚的和平和安全就决不会得到保障。”
    现在，杜勒斯已在喀喇蚩会议结束之后，到亚洲各地“访问”去了。杜勒斯一面拿着马尼拉条约这个“大棒”，来恫吓这个军事集团以内和以外的亚洲国家，挑拨亚洲国家之间的团结，紧张国际局势；一面却又装腔作势，把自己打扮成是亚洲人民的“朋友”。杜勒斯原以为可以摇身一变，进行招摇撞骗；但在亚洲人民的心目中，他已成为一只“不祥之鸟”。
    亚洲人民维护和平和加强国际合作的决心是异常坚定的。亚洲人民的团结一致，必然会使美国侵略集团的一切阴谋归于失败。“实力”政策的失败是无可挽救的。
