Xinhua News Agency, March 18th, Paris dispatch: One of France's most outstanding scientists in radiochemistry and nuclear physics, a well-known social activist, and member of the World Peace Council, Irène Joliot-Curie (wife of Frédéric Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council) passed away in Paris on March 17th.

　　Irène Joliot-Curie was born in 1897 and was the daughter of the famous French scientists Pierre Curie and Maria Skłodowska-Curie, who discovered the element radium. Together with her husband, Professor Frédéric Joliot-Curie, she discovered artificial radioactivity and experimentally proved that light can be transformed into matter. The phenomenon of artificial radioactivity has extremely important significance for science and laid the foundation for the unlimited peaceful use of atomic energy. For this discovery, the Joliot-Curie couple was awarded the Nobel Prize.

　　Irène Joliot-Curie's outstanding achievements in science led her to hold leadership positions in various French scientific research institutions on many occasions. She was also a member of many scientific organizations, a foreign corresponding academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the Belgian Royal Academy of Medicine, and the Indian Academy of Sciences. She wrote fifty-four scientific works, either alone or in collaboration with Frédéric Joliot-Curie, and her scientific authority was universally recognized abroad.

　　Irène Joliot-Curie was also an outstanding social activist in France. During the difficult years of Hitler's occupation, she actively participated in the French people's struggle against fascism. After the war, she actively participated in the World Women's Congress, the World Congress for the Defense of Peace, and other international activities for the defense of peace. Irène Joliot-Curie and her husband were tireless fighters for striving to use atomic energy for peaceful purposes only.

　　The people of France and the people of the world mourn the death of Irène Joliot-Curie. The French government has decided on the 17th that Irène Joliot-Curie will be given a state funeral.
