Comrades! The Congress listened with rapt attention and great excitement to the summary report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party delivered by Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev. This report has received a warm response among the working people of our country and the world. The report is an example of the creative application of Marxist-Leninist theory to the practice of communist construction.

The entire activity of the Central Committee has been conducted along the path indicated by Lenin. The hallmark of the work of our Party Central Committee is, first and foremost, its faithfulness to Leninism and the Leninist style of leadership. The most important theoretical issues to which our Party has paid attention in the past period are reflected in Comrade Khrushchev's report. It raised many new questions, which proved that our Central Committee is the true theoretical center of the Party and the country. The interpretations of the issues raised in the report, such as the peaceful coexistence of two systems, the possibility of preventing war in the present era, the forms of transition to socialism in different countries, the development of socialist relations of production in our country, and the road to communism in our country, will greatly promote creative work in the theoretical field.

The Central Committee's instruction on the need to combat the remnants of subjective idealism on the issue of the role of the individual in history has played and continues to play a very important role in developing the Party's ideological work and in the political and ideological education of our cadres. As everyone knows, Marxist-Leninist classics believe that the cult of personality is a serious and harmful violation of the materialist understanding of history and is a widely disseminated form of idealism. The theory of "heroes and mobs" is linked to diminishing the creative role of the masses.

The Central Committee, in implementing Lenin's instructions on the decisive role of the masses of the people as the true creators and promoters of history, demanded a struggle against the cult of personality. It should be frankly stated that we, the Party members entrusted with ideological work, have not been able to keep up with the Central Committee's very important instructions. The serious backwardness in the development of social sciences should be acknowledged.

Comrade Khrushchev correctly pointed out that at present, the economic aspect of Marxist-Leninist theory and the issues of concrete economics have been elevated to a primary position. However, our scientific workers and economists have so far done little to help the Party solve economic tasks. Separation from life, separation from the practice of communist construction – this is the fundamental weakness of economists.

Soviet historical science has made some achievements before the 20th Congress of the CPSU. Many specialized articles and summary works on the history of the Great Patriotic War and world history have been published, including the first volume of the ten-volume "World History." The sixth volume of the history of our country's capital, Moscow, has been completed. Large-scale scientific and investigative work has been conducted to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the reunification of Ukraine and Russia and the 50th anniversary of the First Russian Revolution. There have also been some achievements in compiling summary works on the history of individual nationalities. However, backwardness also exists among historians. Comrades Mikoyan, Suslov, and Shepilov correctly pointed out the serious backwardness in the study of Soviet society, which is an extremely important and combative area of our scientific research on Soviet history.

Shifting attention to economic theory does not mean placing other departments of social sciences in a secondary position. Comrade Khrushchev emphasized that the glorious history of our Party will continue to be one of the most important sources for educating our cadres. He pointed out that it is necessary to compile a popular, fact-based, and Marxist textbook on Party history. There is no doubt that the necessity of compiling a summary work or textbook on the history of Soviet society for our cadres has matured.

Next year is the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. Not only our country but the whole world is increasingly interested in the history of our great struggle and victory. Now, a comprehensive history of the Great October Socialist Revolution and Soviet society is needed. This book should be written scientifically and be able to attract people. It should show our youth, who enjoy the fruits of the Great October Revolution, that our victory was not achieved out of thin air. It came from the long and arduous struggle of the broad masses of people, led by the revolutionary proletariat, against exploitation and oppression.

The proletarian party founded by Lenin has grown and consolidated on the solid foundation of creative Marxism-Leninism. It has successfully accepted the "latest achievements" of the political experience of the international workers' revolutionary movement and transformed them to suit the specific conditions of the Russian liberation struggle. The new type of Leninist party is capable of leading the working class and the laboring peasantry in an alliance to fight, guiding them to achieve the historical victory of defeating Tsarist rule and capitalism, and ensuring the victory of socialism in our country. This book on the history of Soviet society should specifically and profoundly reveal the most important historical laws and characteristics of the construction of socialism in the Soviet Union, show the driving force and source of the victory of the Soviet system, and scientifically and vividly describe the prospects of our advance towards communism. This glorious task can and should ignite the creative enthusiasm of our Soviet scientists. If we earnestly organize the writing of this book, then this book will not only have historical significance for our cadres and activists of the international workers' movement, but also practical significance, and they will be able to draw lessons from the historical dialectic from our experience.

Our scientists' profound and creative mastery of Marxist-Leninist theory is a decisive condition for the ideological growth of our cadres in social sciences. Lenin laid the ideological foundation of the Party in his book "What Is To Be Done?" At that time, he condemned those who did not understand the necessity of concrete study of history and revealing its laws. Lenin wrote: "... some people who simply look at history in the 'Ilovaisky way' also call themselves Marxists." (Collected Works of Lenin, Vol. 5, p. 330)

The task of raising the study of the history of our great Communist Party to a truly scientific height is a very urgent task. In this regard, the resistance of the influence of the cult of personality to advanced science is particularly strong. Now we cannot help but feel uneasy: serious scientific work on the history of the Party is almost non-existent; the journal on Party history issues that was once published before the war is not published now; there is no scientific center for the study of Party history. The Institute of History of the Soviet Academy of Sciences has also not conducted research on Party history issues.

Our work in publishing Lenin's theoretical legacy is also not entirely satisfactory. Many important documents of Lenin have not yet been published. Some articles and letters selected from the second and third editions of Lenin's Collected Works and Lenin's Anthology, for some reason, have not been included in the fourth edition. Lenin's "Notebooks on Imperialism" and certain other works have become book treasures, and there are omissions in the bibliography of the new edition of Lenin's Collected Works. Therefore, teachers and propagandists have to refer to two versions of Lenin's Collected Works at the same time. I think it is now time to consider publishing a complete Lenin's Collected Works for research purposes.

To this day, there is still no detailed and scientific biography of Lenin. Nor has there been published a scientifically based biography of Marx and Engels, the founders of scientific communism.

In our Party history books, the role of Lenin as the leader of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state is not revealed sufficiently. Lenin's activities during the intervention and civil war are poorly explained. However, as long as a careful study of the documents is conducted, it can be seen how Lenin led the Central Committee and the Soviet government, how he led the Council of Workers' and Peasants' Defense, and what a huge and comprehensive (including military) activity Lenin carried out in those years, thereby ensuring the victory of the Soviet regime.

Lenin's political and economic activities after the civil war are explained very poorly. Take 1922 as an example, some works create the impression that Lenin was ill and completely unaware of state affairs. However, in reality, a careful study of the documents shows that Lenin, although ill at this time, was still leading peaceful socialist construction and put forward the initiative to establish the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

In our Party's historical books, the activities of Lenin's comrades-in-arms, the old Bolsheviks, are reflected very inadequately. How many concrete and important details can the memoirs of the old Bolsheviks provide, which will be able to enrich our dry and disembodied works on Party history with the atmosphere of the era and the vividness of life? Shouldn't the beneficial experience of the past Institute of Party History be used? Of course, this experience should be properly processed. In view of the upcoming 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, doing so is entirely appropriate.

Some historians embellish historical facts, simplify them, and interpret history one-sidedly and untruthfully. They describe the path the Party has traveled as a series of victorious marches without any difficulties. However, Lenin wrote this: the Party has learned from life and practice more than once. Lenin said in the summary report of the Central Committee at the Eighth Party Congress: "We should grope around in all directions... We have started a cause that no one in the world has ever engaged in to such an extent." (Collected Works of Lenin, Vol. 29, p. 132) Unfortunately, historians often do not consider Lenin's words.

In Comrade Khrushchev's report, the shortcomings in our economic, political, and Party activities were boldly exposed. The Party resolutely opposes attempts to embellish the current situation, but some of our historians do not have the courage to point out the difficulties and shortcomings in the Party's past activities. In many pamphlets published in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Russian Revolution, there is absolutely no explanation of any difficulties the Party encountered in the struggle to establish a general democratic front against Tsarist rule, no explanation of the inner-Party struggle, and no explanation of the history of various organizations, especially the history of Party organizations under the leadership of the United Committee. Lenin resolutely opposed arbitrary handling of facts and opposed taking facts out of the entire context of phenomena. He explained that it is necessary to establish a foundation with accurate and irrefutable facts, and demanded that not individual facts be seized, but the entire sum of facts, so as to avoid suspicion, "suspicion that the facts are randomly selected, suspicion that 'subjectively' concocted things may be used to replace the objective connections and their interactions of the entire historical phenomenon...." (Collected Works of Lenin, Vol. 23, pp. 266-267) Some historians put forward wrong arguments, and in order to confirm their arguments, they do not hesitate to arbitrarily treat the entire works. When reprinting the work "In the Flames of the First Russian Revolution" by the old Bolshevik Vasilyev-Yuzhin, which was published for the first time in 1927, entire pages were deleted from the book, simply because it talked about the Moscow Committee's mistakes in dealing with the Rostov Regiment uprising.

The summary report of the Central Committee made by Comrade N. S. Khrushchev pointed out that it is necessary to carefully study specific facts, make realistic estimates, and not decorate them. It also emphasized that our entire ideological work should develop at a high theoretical level and in the struggle against dogmatism and scholasticism. This instruction has been greatly welcomed. Failure to truthfully explain the actual situation of history will hinder our cadres and foreign friends from correctly applying the valuable experience of the struggle of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, we have not consistently and resolutely struggled against the phenomenon of estimating historical events by deviating from Leninism, against anti-historicism and simplifying factors, against the subjectivist attitude towards history, and against the habit of modernizing and pandering to fashion.

Comrade Mikoyan gave a fair criticism of a related book on the issue of crushing Ukrainian bourgeois nationalism. It should be admitted that our historians did not discover the errors in this book, and our newspapers, including the "Problems of History" magazine, published praising reviews of this book. This is not accidental. The lack of analysis of the social basis of this or that historical phenomenon, the subjective interpretation of some events, such as simply attributing all our failures to the sabotage activities of enemies or people declared as enemies, and attributing our achievements to the genius of individual leaders, are all widespread remnants of the cult of personality, which should be eradicated.

Comrade Khrushchev clarified some important issues regarding the Party's and the Soviet state's national policies in the report. He pointed out how great the achievements the backward nations, which were oppressed in old Russia, have made after obtaining equal status in the friendly family of all nationalities in the Soviet Union. Our responsibility is to use concrete historical materials to clarify how the Communist Party eliminated the mutual distrust that existed between nationalities in the Tsarist era, how it united them with the bonds of friendship, and to point out how the Party has always cared about the interests, national characteristics, and aspirations of all large and small nationalities, and cared about cultivating their fraternal friendship and internationalist spirit.

These issues cannot be correctly resolved if the errors in explaining the national situation in the Tsarist era are not overcome. Our textbooks and books explaining the history of various nationalities have paid little attention to exposing the national colonial oppression of Tsarist autocracy. Some authors, while quite correctly emphasizing the progressive significance of these nationalities merging with Russia, have overlooked other aspects of the matter. Tsarist rule brought brutal oppression to all nationalities, hindering their political, economic, and cultural development. Everyone knows that Lenin called Tsarist Russia the "prison of nations." Only the October Revolution eliminated this prison. The history of the Russian national movement should be studied in depth. When studying these movements, it should be based on specific historical conditions, taking into account all internal and external factors, and first of all, paying attention to the movements of the masses themselves. We must treat all progressive phenomena in the history of large and small nationalities with caution, and continue to fight on two fronts—against great-nation chauvinism and local nationalism, because these are two sides of the same coin.

In his report, Comrade Khrushchev clarified the Leninist principles of Soviet foreign policy. Khrushchev also pointed out how our Party and government are implementing these principles. Soviet historians should more deeply clarify the history of Soviet foreign policy, the relationship between the Soviet Union and capitalist countries, and the profound principled difference between the Soviet state's peaceful diplomacy based on respect for the rights and interests of all nations and the imperialist countries' diplomacy based on plunder and colonial oppression. The Soviet state buried the Tsarist Russia's policy of plunder and oppression and opened a new era in the relations between the peoples of the world. Therefore, the views of some authors are incorrect. They violate the arguments of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, describing the aggressive wars waged by Tsarist Russia as just wars, and idealizing the Franco-Russian alliance at the end of the 19th century or Tsarist Russia's policy towards China, etc. Their views violate historical facts and also make it impossible to understand to what extent the Soviet government, since its establishment, has implemented a fundamentally new foreign policy.

The development of shortcomings in historical science and other social sciences is related to the unsatisfactory state of training scientific cadres. The resolutions on degree theses, degrees, and titles were made in 1934-1935. In the last 20 years, especially in the post-war years, tens of thousands of people have defended their theses. However, the quality of many of these degree theses is very low. There are few creative explorations in the theses, too many quotations, and a large number of verbatim repetitions of formulas and principles, sometimes paraphrasing what has been read with and without quotation marks.

The Central Committee established the Academy of Social Sciences in order to train the Party's theoretical cadres, and recently made a decision to improve the work of the Academy of Social Sciences. However, no transformation has been seen in the work of this academy. In the past 5 years, many degree theses have been defended in the Academy of Social Sciences, but no more than 10% of them have been published, and the published ones are mainly articles and pamphlets.

The degree theses of the postgraduate students of our scientific research institutions and universities are often the only scientific works. The word "postgraduate" comes from the Latin word "seeker," "interested person." Now, a large proportion of our postgraduate students only "seek" a degree worth seeking, and are rarely interested in enriching science and practice. In this way, it is difficult for us to expect to obtain fully valuable research works. More effective measures should be taken so that we fundamentally do not have people who only "seek" degrees.

There are many major shortcomings in scientific work institutions. Here we encounter formalism and bureaucratic elements. There are many resolutions and meetings, but few scientific works and creative scientific discussions. The Soviet Academy of Sciences has a huge institution like ordinary agencies, without considering that science has its own characteristics. Leading science is different from leading the economy, and different methods should be adopted. The situation is particularly bad in leading and helping social science research institutions that do not have the basic conditions for conducting scientific work.

It is necessary to more boldly absorb scientists to participate in the study of current issues, assign them tasks, and strengthen the opposition to shirking responsibility and shrinking back in science. Scientific problems cannot be solved by commands or voting. The Party teaches us that science can only develop through free exchange of opinions and through discussion. We must widely apply this basic method of developing science based on the firm foundation of Marxism.

In our science, young and outstanding cadres are constantly growing up. They are not satisfied with the old ways, they overcome dogmatism in science, and they boldly raise new, sharp, and controversial questions. In this regard, it is worth mentioning the readers' meeting of the "Problems of History" magazine. The meeting was held very enthusiastically. At the meeting, criticisms were raised against the entire situation on the historical front. Historians sharply raised the issues of reorganizing the Institute of History and raising the social role of Soviet history. They expressed dissatisfaction with the work of the Institute of History, which has more than 300 staff members, but publishes no more than 10 specialized articles each year.

The issue of establishing an independent institute specializing in the history of our motherland has long been mature. Only a few countries do not have an institute for the study of their own history, and our country is one of them. The issue of organizing an All-Union Association of Historians, publishing various magazines studying the history of various stages, and convening an All-Union Conference of Historians have also matured.

It should not be forgotten that our activities have great international significance. Scholars from all countries attach great importance to our speeches. We deeply felt this at various international conferences and when meeting with foreign scholars. Our foreign friends are looking forward to our help. In recent years, our international connections have expanded. This connection should continue to be strengthened. We should cooperate more closely with scholars from the people's democratic countries and progressive historians in capitalist countries. There are many honest scholars abroad, and although they are not Marxists, we can still cooperate with them. Of course, we cannot and will not abandon our ideological position at any time and in any situation. Comrade Khrushchev emphasized that we must carefully sharpen our ideological weapons. We must remember that the leaders of the imperialist camp are doing their utmost to strengthen and intensify the struggle against Marxism and against communism. Eden once gave a speech saying that bourgeois thinkers now have a difficult task, which is to fight for the souls of people, and this struggle is currently reflected in ideology.

Well! We accept the challenge. We will continue to intensify the struggle against bourgeois ideology. We are confident in the outcome of this struggle. Marxist-Leninist thought has great appeal. The superiority of the socialist system will become clearer and clearer to hundreds of millions of working people around the world. People of all countries are increasingly expressing sympathy for the Soviet Union—the fortress of the most advanced ideas being realized in socialist countries.

The 20th Congress of the Communist Party is a great and epoch-making milestone in the struggle for the victory of the advanced ideas of Marxism-Leninism. This Congress has attracted the attention of hundreds of millions of people. The resolutions made at the meeting will ignite the hearts of all those who are inspired by the ideas of peace, democracy, and socialism with the flame of great hope. The people of our country, united around the Leninist Central Committee, will fight with new strength and greater enthusiasm to realize the magnificent plan of building a communist society as stipulated by the 20th Congress.

Long live our beloved Communist Party and its historic 20th Congress!

### 潘克拉托娃在苏共代表大会上的发言

    潘克拉托娃在苏共代表大会上的发言
    同志们！代表大会聚精会神地、十分兴奋地听取了尼基塔·谢尔盖耶维奇·赫鲁晓夫所作的共产党中央委员会的总结报告，这个报告在我国和全世界劳动人民中间都得到了热烈的反应。这个报告是把马克思列宁主义理论创造性地运用到共产主义建设实践中的范例。
    中央委员会的全部活动都是按照列宁所指示的道路进行的。我们党中央委员会的工作的特征首先就是忠实于列宁主义及列宁式的领导作风。我们党在过去一段时期内所注意的最重要的理论问题，都反映在赫鲁晓夫同志的报告中。其中提出了许多新的问题，这些问题证明了我们中央委员会是党和国家的真正的理论中心。对报告中所提出的关于两种制度和平共处、关于在现时代防止战争的可能性、关于不同的国家向社会主义过渡的形式、关于我国社会主义生产关系的发展、关于我国向共产主义过渡的道路等等问题的阐释，将大大推动理论方面的创造性工作。
    中央委员会关于必须就个人在历史上的作用这一问题进行反对主观唯心主义观点残余的斗争的指示，曾经并且仍然对发展党的思想工作、对我们干部的政治思想教育起很重要的作用。大家知道，马克思列宁主义经典作家认为，个人崇拜是严重地和有害地违背对历史作唯物主义的了解的一种表现，是唯心主义的一种广泛流传的形式。“英雄和群氓”的理论是同缩小群众的创造作用有联系的。
    中央委员会执行列宁的关于历史的真正创造者和推动者——人民群众的具有决定性的作用的指示，要求同个人崇拜作斗争。应当直率地说明，我们，受党的委托作思想工作的党员，远没有充分跟得上中央委员会的各项非常重要的指示。应当承认社会科学发展的严重落后现象。
    赫鲁晓夫同志正确地指出，目前，马克思列宁主义理论的经济学方面、具体经济学的问题已经被提到了首要地位。但是我们的科学工作者、经济学家到现在还很少帮助党解决经济任务。脱离生活，脱离共产主义建设的实践——这就是经济学家们的根本弱点。
    苏联的历史科学在苏共第二十次代表大会以前获得了一些成绩。很多有关卫国战争史和世界史的专门论文和概括性的著作出版了，其中包括十卷本的“世界史”第一卷，完成了我们祖国首都——莫斯科的历史的第六卷，为纪念乌克兰和俄罗斯重新合并300周年和纪念第一次俄国革命50周年，曾经进行大规模的科学和调查工作，在编写个别民族历史的概括性著作方面也有某些成绩。但是，在历史学家当中也存在着落后现象。米高扬同志、苏斯洛夫同志和谢皮洛夫同志正确地指出了研究苏维埃社会方面的严重落后现象，而这正是我们对苏联历史的科学研究工作中的一个极其重要的战斗性的范围。
    把注意力转到经济理论方面决不是说把其他社会科学部门就摆到次要地位。赫鲁晓夫同志强调指出，我们党的光荣历史今后仍将是教育我们干部的最重要的泉源之一。他指出，必须编写出一部通俗的、依据历史事实的、马克思主义的党史教科书。毫无疑问，为我们干部编写一部关于苏维埃社会历史的概括性著作或教材的必要性已经成熟了。
    明年是伟大的十月社会主义革命40周年。不仅我们国家，而且全世界对我们伟大的斗争和胜利的历史的兴趣都日益增长。现在需要一部伟大的十月社会主义革命和苏维埃社会的概括性历史。这部书要写的合乎科学并且能够吸引人，它应当向享受伟大十月革命果实的我们青年一代表明，我们的胜利不是凭空地得来的。它是在以革命的无产阶级为首的广大人民群众反对剥削和压迫的漫长的和顽强的斗争中得来的。
    列宁所创立的无产阶级政党在创造性的马克思列宁主义的巩固基础上壮大和巩固了，它成功地接受了国际工人革命运动的政治经验的“最新成就”，并且把它改造以适应俄国解放斗争的具体条件。新型的列宁式的党有能力领导工人阶级和劳动农民群众结成联盟进行斗争，引导他们取得战胜沙皇制度和资本主义的历史性胜利，保证了社会主义在我国的胜利。在这本苏维埃社会历史书中应该具体地和深刻地揭示出苏联建设社会主义的最重要的历史规律和特点，表明苏维埃制度胜利的动力和泉源，科学地和鲜明地描述我们向共产主义前进的远景；这一光荣的任务可以、而且应当燃起我们苏联科学家的创造性热情。如果我们认真地组织这本书的编写工作，那么这本书对于我们的干部和国际工人运动活动家来说，将不仅具有历史学的意义，而且还具有实践的意义，他们将可以从我们的经验中吸取历史辩证法的教训。
    我们的科学家深刻地、创造性地掌握马克思列宁主义理论，是我们的干部在社会科学方面思想上成长的决定性条件。列宁在“做什么？”一书中奠定了党的思想基础，他那时就谴责那些不了解具体研究历史和揭示它的规律性的必要性的人。列宁写道：“……有些简直按‘依洛瓦斯基方式来观察历史的人也自称为马克思主义者”。（列宁全集第5卷330页）
    把对我们伟大的共产党的历史的研究提高到真正的科学高度这一任务，是十分迫切的任务。在这方面，个人崇拜的影响对先进科学的阻力特别强。现在我们不能不感到不安：关于党史的认真的科学工作几乎就没有进行；战前曾经发行过的关于党史问题的杂志现在没有出版；没有研究党史的科学中心。苏联科学院历史研究所也没有对党史问题进行研究。
    我们在发表列宁的理论遗产方面的工作也作得不能完全令人满意。列宁的许多重要文件仍然没有发表。列宁全集第二版和第三版和列宁文选所编选的某些文章和书信，不知道为什么没有收入第四版。列宁的“帝国主义笔记”和其他某些作品已经成了图书珍藏，在新版的列宁全集的书目表中有遗漏现象。因此，教师和宣传员们不得不同时参考两种版本的列宁全集。我觉得，现在已经是该考虑出版供研究用的完整的列宁全集的时候了。
    直到今天还没有一本详细而科学的列宁传记。也没有出版关于科学共产主义奠基人马克思和恩格斯的有科学根据的传记。
    在我们的党史书籍中，对列宁作为布尔什维克党和苏维埃国家领导者的作用揭示得不够。对列宁在干涉和内战时期的活动说明得很差。而只要对文件进行仔细的研究就可以看出，列宁是如何领导中央委员会和苏维埃政府的，他是如何率领工农国防委员会的，列宁在这些年代中进行了如何庞大的、全面的（其中也包括军事上的）活动，从而保证了苏维埃政权的胜利。
    对列宁在内战之后的政治和经济活动，阐明得非常差。拿1922年来说，某些作品造成了这么一种印象：列宁病了，完全没有过问国事。然而实际上仔细研究文件就可以看出，列宁这时虽然有病，还是在领导着和平的社会主义建设，并且提出了建立苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的倡议。
    在我们党的历史书籍中，反映列宁的战友、老布尔什维克的活动非常不够。对老布尔什维克们的回忆不知可以提供多少具体的和重要的细节，这将能够以时代气息和活生生的生活气息来充实我们枯燥的、失去具体形象的党史著作。难道还不应该运用过去的党史研究所的有益经验吗？当然，这些经验应当适当地加以加工。鉴于伟大的十月社会主义革命40周年即将来到，这样做是完全适宜的。
    某些历史学家粉饰历史事实，把它们简单化，片面地、不真实地阐述历史。他们把党所经历的道路描写成没有任何困难的一连串的胜利进军。而列宁是这样写的：党不止一次地向生活、向实际学习。列宁在第八次党代表大会上所作的中央委员会的总结报告中说：“我们应当四面八方摸索而行……我们开始从事了这样一个事业，而这个事业在世界上还没有人以如此广泛的程度从事过。”（列宁全集第29卷第132页）十分遗憾，历史学家们常常没有考虑列宁的这句话。
    在赫鲁晓夫同志的报告中，大胆地揭发了我们的经济、政治和党的活动中的缺点。党坚决反对粉饰当前状况的企图，而我们的某些历史学家却没有勇气指出党过去的活动中的困难和缺点。在为纪念俄国革命50周年而出的许多小册子中，都完全没有说明党在争取建立反对沙皇斗争的一般的民主阵线的斗争中的任何困难，没有说明党内斗争，没有说明各个组织的历史，特别是在联合委员会领导之下的党组织的历史。列宁坚决反对任意处理事实，反对把事实从整个现象联系中抽出来。他曾经说明必须用准确的、无可争辩的事实来建立基础，要求不要抓个别的事实，而抓事实的全部总和，以免发生怀疑，“怀疑那些事实是随便挑选出来的，怀疑可能是以‘主观’泡制的东西来代替全部历史现象的客观联系和它们的相互作用……。”（列宁全集第23卷第266—267页）某些历史学家提出了错误的论点，而且，为了证实他们的论点就不惜任意对待整个的著作。在再版1927年首次出版的老布尔什维克华西里耶夫—尤任的作品“在第一次俄国革命的火焰中”的时候，书中整页整页地被删掉了，就因为其中谈到莫斯科委员会在对待罗斯托夫团起义上的错误。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫所作的中央委员会的总结报告中指出，要好好研究具体事实，作出实事求是的估计，不要装饰点缀，要使我们的整个思想工作在高度理论水平上、在同教条主义和学究习气的斗争中发展，这一指示会受到很大的欢迎。不如实地阐明历史的实际情况，就会妨碍我们的干部和国外的朋友正确运用苏联共产党的宝贵斗争经验。可惜我们没有同对历史事件的估计脱离列宁主义的现象、同反历史主义和简单化的因素、同对历史的主观主义态度、同把历史现代化和趋奉时尚的习气作一贯的、坚决的斗争。
    米高扬同志就粉碎乌克兰资产阶级民族主义这一问题给有关的书作了一个公正的批评。应当承认，我们的历史学家没有发现这本书里面的错误，而我们的报刊，其中包括“历史问题”杂志，都对这本书发表了赞扬的评介文章。这并不是偶然的。对这样或那样的历史现象的社会基础缺乏分析，对一些事件用主观主义方法加以解释，例如把我们一切失败简单地归咎于敌人或被宣布为敌人的人们的破坏活动，而把我们的成就归功于个别领袖的天才，这些都是广泛地传播的个人崇拜的残余，应当把这些东西加以肃清。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在报告中阐明了党和苏维埃国家民族政策方面的一些重要问题。他指出，早先在旧俄受压迫的、落后的民族，在苏联各民族友爱的大家庭中取得了平等地位以后，获得了多么巨大的成就。我们的责任就是用具体的历史材料阐明，共产党如何消除了各民族之间在沙俄时代存在的互相不信任，如何用友爱的纽带把他们团结起来，指出党如何一直关心一切大、小民族的利益、民族特点和愿望，关心培养他们的兄弟友爱和国际主义精神。
    如果不克服在说明沙俄时代民族情况方面的错误，这些问题就不能够得到正确的解决。我们的阐述各民族历史的教科书和书籍几乎没有注意揭发沙皇独裁统治的民族殖民压迫。有些作者固然完全正确地强调了这些民族合并于俄罗斯的进步意义，然而却忽略了事情的其他方面。沙皇统治给各民族带来了残酷的压迫，阻碍了他们的政治、经济和文化的发展。大家都知道，列宁把沙皇俄国称为“各民族的监狱”。只是十月革命才消灭了这个监狱。应该深刻地研究俄国民族运动史。研究这些运动的时候应该根据
  具体的历史条件，要考虑到一切内外因素，首先要注意到人民群众本身的运动。必须谨慎地对待大民族和小民族历史中的一切进步现象，并且继续在两条战线上进行斗争——反对大国沙文主义和地方民族主义，因为这是一件事情的两面。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在报告中阐明了苏联对外政策的列宁主义原则。赫鲁晓夫还指出了我们党和政府是怎样实现着这些原则的。苏联的历史学家应该更深刻地阐明苏联对外政策的历史、苏联同资本主义国家的相互关系、以尊重各国人民的权利和利益为基础的苏维埃国家的和平外交政策同帝国主义国家以掠夺和进行殖民压迫为基础的外交政策之间深刻的原则性的区别。苏维埃国家埋葬了沙俄的掠夺和压迫政策，并且开辟了世界各国人民之间的关系的新纪元。因此，某些著作者的看法是不正确的，他们违反马克思、恩格斯、列宁的论点，把沙俄进行的侵略战争说成是正义战争，把19世纪末叶的俄法联盟或者沙俄对中国的政策等等理想化了。他们的这种看法违反了历史事实，同时也不可能使人了解，苏维埃政府从成立的时候起在怎样一种程度上执行着原则上是新的对外政策。
    发展历史科学和其他社会科学中的缺点是同培养科学干部的不能令人满意的状况有关系的。关于学位论文、学位和称号的决议是在1934—1935年作出的。在最近20年来，特别是在战后的年代中，成千上万的人进行了论文答辩。但是其中许多学位论文的质量是很低的。论文中很少有创造性的探讨，引语太多，还有大量逐字逐句地重复的公式和原理，有时用引号和不用引号转述读过的东西。
    中央委员会为了培养党的理论干部成立了社会科学研究院，并且在不久以前作出了关于改进社会科学研究院的工作的决定。但是在这一研究院的工作中还没有看到什么转变。最近5年来在社会科学研究院中已经作了很多的学位论文答辩，但是其中拿去发表的却不超过10％，而且发表的主要是文章和小册子。
    我们的科学研究机关和高等学校的研究生的学位论文常常是唯一的科学作品。“研究生”这个字是从拉丁文“探求者”、“有志趣者”这个字来的。现在我们有很大部分的研究生仅仅“探求”值得寻求的学位，而很少有志于丰富科学和实践，这样我们很难指望将会得到充分有价值的研究作品。应该采取更有效的措施，使得我们根本没有只“探求”学位的人。
    在科学工作机关中有着许多重大的缺点。这里我们碰到形式主义和官僚主义的分子。决议和会议很多，但是科学著作和创造性的科学讨论却很少。苏联科学院有一个庞大的、和普通机关一样的机构，而没有考虑到科学有它的特点，领导科学同领导经济不同，应该采用不同的方法。在领导和帮助没有进行科学工作的起码条件的社会科学研究机关这方面，情况特别不好。
    必须更大胆地吸收科学家参与研究当前的问题，分派他们任务，加强反对推卸责任和在科学上缩手缩脚的现象。科学问题不能用命令或者表决的方式求得解决。党教导我们，科学通过自由交换意见，通过讨论才能发展。我们必须依据马克思主义的牢固基础，广泛地运用发展科学的这个基本方法。
    在我们的科学中，年青的优秀的干部不断地成长起来，他们不满足于老一套的东西，他们克服着科学中的教条主义，大胆地提出新的、尖锐的和带争论性的问题。在这方面值得提出的是“历史问题”杂志的读者会议。这个会议开得非常热烈。在会议上，对历史战线上的整个情况提出了批评。历史学家尖锐地提出了关于改组历史研究所和关于提高苏维埃历史学的社会作用的问题。他们对于历史研究所的工作表示不满，这个研究所共有300多个工作人员，但是每一年发表的专门论文不超过10篇。
    关于成立一个专门研究我们祖国历史的独立的研究所的问题早就成熟了。只有为数不多的国家没有研究本国历史的研究所，而我们的国家就是其中的一个。关于组织全苏历史学家协会的问题、关于出版研究各阶段历史的各种杂志的问题以及关于召开全苏历史学家会议的问题也都成熟了。
    不应该忘记，我们的活动有巨大的国际意义。所有国家的学者都很重视我们的言论。在各次国际大会上和同外国学者见面的时候，我们深深体会到了这一点。我们的外国朋友期待着我们的帮助。最近几年来，我们的国际联系扩大了。应该继续加强这种联系。我们应该同人民民主国家的学者和资本主义国家中进步的历史学家更紧密地合作。外国有不少正直的学者，虽然他们不是马克思主义者，我们还是可以同他们合作的。当然，在任何时候和任何情况下我们都不能也不会放弃自己的思想立场。赫鲁晓夫同志强调说过，必须仔细地把我们的思想武器磨得锐利起来。我们应该记住，帝国主义阵营的首领们在极力加强和加紧对马克思主义、对共产主义的斗争。艾登有一次发表演讲说，资产阶级的思想家现在有一个艰巨的任务，这就是为争取人的灵魂而斗争，这个斗争目前正反映在思想意识中。
    好吧！我们接受挑战。我们要继续加紧对资产阶级思想意识进行斗争。我们对这个斗争的结局是有信心的。马克思列宁主义思想有巨大的吸引力。社会主义制度的优越性将越来越清楚地展现在全世界千百万劳动人民的眼前。各国人民对苏联——在社会主义国家中实现着的最先进的思想的堡垒——日益表示同情。
    共产党第二十次代表大会是争取马克思列宁主义的先进思想胜利的斗争的伟大的划时代的标志。这次代表大会吸引了千百万人的注意。会上所作的决议将用伟大的希望的火焰燃烧起所有被和平、民主和社会主义的思想所鼓舞的人的心。我国人民团结在列宁主义的中央委员会的周围，将以新的力量和更大的热情为实现第二十次代表大会所规定的建设共产主义社会这个宏伟计划而斗争。
    我们亲爱的共产党和它的具有历史意义的第二十次代表大会万岁！
