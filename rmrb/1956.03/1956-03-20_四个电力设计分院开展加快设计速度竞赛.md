    Four Electric Power Design Institutes Launch Competition to Accelerate Design Speed
    The Beijing, Shanghai, Changchun, and Wuhan Electric Power Design Institutes have proposed an inter-institute competition to "accelerate design speed and submit drawings earlier."
    The Beijing Electric Power Design Institute guarantees that in the competition, it will submit all drawings on schedule according to the state plan, and strive to submit 50% of the engineering drawings ahead of schedule; labor productivity will increase by an average of 20% based on 1955 levels; and the quality of surveying, mapping, and design will strive to reach excellence. The Shanghai Electric Power Design Institute proposed competition conditions guaranteeing that it would complete the design tasks for all construction drawings for the entire year before the end of June, submitting drawings an average of more than four months ahead of schedule; and that surveying, mapping, and design production efficiency would increase by an average of more than 100%. The Changchun Electric Power Design Institute guarantees that construction drawings for various projects starting construction in 1956 will be released one to six months ahead of the original plan; and that construction drawings for various projects starting construction in 1957 will be released two to ten months ahead of the original plan. The Wuhan Electric Power Design Institute guarantees to overfulfill the design task by 140%. These four Electric Power Design Institutes also proposed indicators for saving funds in the competition conditions. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    四个电力设计分院开展加快设计速度竞赛
    北京、上海、长春、武汉四个电力设计分院提出相互间开展“加快设计速度、提早交出图纸”的院际竞赛。
    北京电力设计分院保证在竞赛中按照国家计划全部按期交出图纸、争取有50％的工程图纸提前交出；劳动生产率在1955年的基础上，平均提高20％；勘测、设计的质量，争取全部达到优良。上海电力设计分院提出的竞赛条件，保证在六月底以前，完成今年全年施工图的设计任务，交出图纸时间平均提前四个月以上；勘测、设计的生产效率平均提高一倍以上。长春电力设计分院保证1956年开始施工的各项工程施工图，比原计划提前一个月到六个月出图；1957年开始施工的各项工程，比原计划提前二个月到十个月出图。武汉电力设计分院保证超额一点四倍完成设计任务。这四个电力设计分院在竞赛条件中还提出了节约资金的指标。　（据新华社讯）
