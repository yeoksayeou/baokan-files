Xinhua News Agency, March 16th: From March 7th to 16th, more than 33,000 people have visited the "U.S. Military Reconnaissance Balloon Exhibition of Intrusion into Our Country's Airspace."

The audience expressed extreme indignation at the U.S.'s war act of launching military reconnaissance balloons. At the exhibition, there was a topographical photograph of the Luan River area in Hebei Province, taken by a U.S. military reconnaissance camera in our country's airspace. Fan Zhiming, a teacher at Luan River Complete Primary School, wrote in the exhibition's guest book: "When I saw the topographical map of our hometown, the Luan River area, taken by the U.S. military reconnaissance balloon, I felt extremely angry. This act of aggression by the U.S. is indefensible." A meteorological worker named Gu from the Chinese Academy of Sciences wrote in the guest book: "The materials exhibited fully prove that the military reconnaissance balloons released by U.S. imperialism are definitely not balloons used for meteorological observation. There are various types of balloons in meteorological literature, but none carry military reconnaissance equipment like this camera for taking topographical photographs. I believe that this is an intolerable infringement on our country's sovereignty by U.S. imperialism." A foreign student studying at Peking University said after visiting the exhibition: "The exhibition clearly illustrates the purpose of the U.S.'s so-called 'Open Skies' proposal. I believe everyone hates this act of war." After visiting the exhibition, many viewers heightened their vigilance and expressed their determination to contribute their efforts to the cause of defending peace. A naval lieutenant said: "Our country's airspace must not be violated. We must heighten our vigilance, defend our country's security, and defend our country's socialist construction." A visitor surnamed Kong wrote in the guest book: "The U.S. imperialists' aggressive acts make me extremely indignant. I am a young man, and I will fight to the end against aggression, to defend our country, and to defend peace."

    十天中有三万多人参观了美国军事侦察气球展览会
    新华社16日讯　从7日到16日，已经有33，000多人参观了“侵入我国领空的美国军事侦察气球展览会”。
    观众对美国放送军事侦察气球的战争行为表示极大的愤慨。展览会上有一幅美国军事侦察摄影机在我国领空拍摄的河北省滦河区域的地形照片。滦河完全小学教员范志明在展览会的留言簿上写道：“当我看到美国军事侦察气球拍摄我们家乡——滦河区的地形图时，使我感到无比愤怒。美国这种侵略行为是无法辩解的”。中国科学院的一位姓顾的气象工作者在留言簿上写道：“展览会所展出的材料完全证明了美国帝国主义所放的军事侦察气球，决不是什么观测气象用的气球。在气象文献上有着各种气球，但决没有带着这种摄影机拍摄地形的军事侦察装备。我认为，这是美国帝国主义对我国主权的不可容忍的侵犯行为。”在北京大学学习的一位外国留学生在参观了展览会以后说：“展览会很好地说明了美国人所谓‘开放天空’的建议的目的何在。我相信每一个人都痛恨这种战争行为。”许多观众在参观展览会以后，提高了警惕性，纷纷表示，要为保卫和平的事业贡献出自己的力量。一位海军少尉说：“祖国领空决不容许侵犯。我们一定要提高警惕，保卫祖国安全，保卫祖国社会主义建设。”一位姓孔的参观者在留言簿上写道：“美帝的侵略行为，使我万分愤慨。我是一个青年，我要为反对侵略、保卫祖国、保卫和平而奋斗到底。”
