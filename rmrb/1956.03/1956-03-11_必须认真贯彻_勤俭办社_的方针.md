To the Editors:

    In the upsurge of agricultural cooperativization, my county has established 147 agricultural production cooperatives of a completely socialist nature, with the number of cooperative member households reaching more than 85% of the total number of households in the county. The cooperative members are highly motivated to produce and are eager to do a good job in production. However, some cooperative management cadres and Party branches have not conscientiously implemented the policy of "running cooperatives diligently and frugally," and mistakenly believe that "since large cooperatives have been established, everything must be done in a grand manner, otherwise it will not be like socialism," thus leading to the tendency of blindly expanding non-productive expenditures and extravagance and waste.

    For example, the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Baohe Township, just established, signed a purchase contract worth more than 37,000 yuan with the department store, arranged single-handedly by the work team leader (member of the county committee), ordering more than 30 bicycles, 14 telephones, 100 lengths of rubber wire, 120 raincoats, 60 pairs of high-top rubber boots, 60 gas lamps, and some radios, phonographs, records, etc. The leaders of the cooperative said, "Anyway, there is support from higher levels and state loans to help, so let's buy them!" Later, the county committee learned about this and stopped it. In the agricultural cooperatives of Houji Township, in the development of water conservancy construction, one production team planned to buy 100 jin each of pork, vermicelli, and wine for digging 3 wells. They said, "To live in socialism, we can't be stingy. It's so cold, we need to eat and drink something to carry out water conservancy construction." The Liguoduan Agricultural Cooperative in Jiangdian District bought one or two raincoats for each of the 28 wells they dug. The Daliu Township Agricultural Cooperative bought 13 pairs of high-top rubber boots, 16 new raincoats, and some leather gloves when digging wells.

    Many cooperative members are opposed to this kind of extravagance and waste. Some said, "Grain production hasn't increased yet, but a lot of money has been spent!" But some staff working in the leading agricultural cooperatives did not listen to these correct opinions.

    Therefore, I suggest that the leading organs in various places must repeatedly and conscientiously carry out education on "running cooperatives diligently and frugally" in the current work of establishing and rectifying agricultural cooperatives, and check and correct the phenomenon of blindly expanding non-productive expenditures and the erroneous management policy of extravagance and waste.

### 必须认真贯彻“勤俭办社”的方针

    必须认真贯彻“勤俭办社”的方针编辑同志：
    在农业合作化的高潮中，我县建立了147个完全社会主义性质的农业生产合作社，入社农户达全县总农户的85％以上。社员们生产劲头很大，迫切要求搞好生产。但是，部分办社干部和党的支部没有认真执行“勤俭办社”的方针，错误地认为“建成了大社一切就得讲大方，要不然就不像社会主义”，因而发生了盲目扩大非生产开支和铺张浪费的偏向。
    例如，保和乡前进农业社刚开始建立，就由工作组长（县委委员）一手包办同百货商店订立了价值37，000元以上的购货合同，订购了自行车30多辆、电话机14部、胶线100丈、雨衣120件、高统胶鞋60双、汽灯60只和一些收音机、留声机、唱片等。社里的领导人员说：“反正有上级支持，国家贷款扶助，就买吧！”后来县委会知道了这件事，才加以制止。侯集乡农业社在开展水利建设中，一个生产队打3眼井，就造计划要买猪肉、粉条和酒各100斤。他们说：“过社会主义就不能小小气气，天这么冷，吃点喝点才能进行水利建设。”姜店区李国端农业社打了28眼井，每打一眼井都买了一、二件雨衣。大刘乡农业社在打井的时候买了高统胶鞋13双、新雨衣16件和一些皮手套。
    对于这种铺张浪费现象，很多社员都是反对的。有的说：“粮食还没增产哩，钱可花了不少！”可是有些领导农业社的工作人员却没有听取这些正确的意见。
    因此，我建议各地领导机关在目前建立和整顿农业社的工作中，必须反复地认真地进行“勤俭办社”的教育，检查和纠正盲目扩大非生产性开支的现象和铺张浪费的错误经营方针。
