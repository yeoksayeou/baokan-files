The Ministry of Heavy Industry system has recently summarized and compiled more than 190 major advanced experiences in preparation for exchange and promotion at the Ministry of Heavy Industry system's advanced producer representative meeting to be held on March 20.

These major advanced experiences, covering production, construction and installation, design, and geological exploration, include some Soviet advanced experiences and suggestions from Soviet experts that have already begun to be used in various enterprises; the other part consists of advanced experiences created by Chinese workers, technicians, and management personnel. Among these advanced experiences, more than 110 relate to production. Advanced experiences such as wet drilling and mine mechanization, which are being promoted in some metal mines, not only improve production efficiency but also greatly improve workers' labor conditions. There are more than 30 advanced experiences related to iron and steel smelting and rolling. Advanced technological experiences such as humidified blast and furnace top adjustment, after being promoted in some enterprises, reduced the volume occupied by each ton of pig iron smelted daily by blast furnaces in 1955 by 6.8% compared to 1954, increasing the production of a large amount of pig iron, saving coke, and improving the quality of pig iron.

The advanced experiences summarized and compiled this time also include major advanced experiences in steel rolling, coking, non-ferrous metal smelting, chemical industry, and building materials.

Among the advanced experiences summarized and compiled this time, more than 80 relate to construction and installation, design, and geology. After the combined hoisting method in construction and installation was promoted at some construction sites, the construction speed was accelerated by one-third to more than doubled.

Currently, more than 600,000 employees in the Ministry of Heavy Industry system are participating in socialist competition. Examples of the vast number of employees creating new records and breaking quotas have become commonplace. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    重工业部系统总结出近二百项重大先进经验
    重工业部系统最近总结和整理出190多项重大先进经验，准备在三月二十日召开的重工业部系统先进生产者代表会议上交流和推广。
    这些包括着生产、建筑安装、设计和地质勘探等方面的重大先进经验，有一部分是已经在各企业开始运用的苏联先进经验和苏联专家的建议；另外一部分是中国工人、技术人员和管理人员创造的先进经验。这些先进经验中，属于生产方面的共有110多项。正在部分金属矿山推广的湿式凿岩、矿山机械化等先进经验，不但使生产效率有所提高，并且大大改善了工人的劳动条件。属于钢铁冶炼和轧制等方面的先进经验共有三十多项。加湿鼓风、炉顶调剂等先进技术经验，在部分企业推广以后，使高炉每天冶炼一吨生铁所占的容积一九五五年比一九五四年减少6.8％，增产了大量生铁，节省了焦炭，提高了生铁质量。
    这次总结和整理出来的先进经验中，还有轧钢、炼焦、有色金属冶炼、化学、建筑材料等方面的重大先进经验。
    这次总结和整理的先进经验中，属于建筑安装、设计和地质方面的先进经验有八十多项。建筑安装方面的组合吊装法在部分工地推广以后，使建设速度加快了三分之一到一倍以上。
    目前，重工业部系统已有六十多万职工参加社会主义竞赛。广大职工创造新纪录和突破定额的事例已普遍出现。　（据新华社讯）
