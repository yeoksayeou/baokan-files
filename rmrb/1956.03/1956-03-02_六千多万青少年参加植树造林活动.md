Xinhua News Agency, 29th: Over 66 million young people and children across the country have participated in afforestation. By the end of 1955, they had planted over 2,287 million trees, afforesting an area of over 5 million mu. More than 182,000 youth afforestation teams and youth afforestation shock brigades have been organized in various regions.

The enthusiasm of young people and children for afforestation is very high. Since last winter, rural youth in Shandong Province have afforested over 287,000 mu, reaching more than half of the province's winter afforestation plan targets. Since last winter, young people in Zhejiang Province have afforested a total of over 600,000 mu. More than 50,000 young people in Guangzhou recently participated in the "Guangzhou Youth Construction Forest" activity, and more than 3,000 young people from the industrial and commercial sectors who had never participated in afforestation also joined. They plan to plant 240,000 eucalyptus and casuarina trees and other economic forests in the afforestation area this spring, making Guangzhou, which is evergreen in all seasons, a city surrounded by forests. In Hubei Province, thanks to the active efforts of more than 3 million young people, many wastelands and roadsides have begun to be greened, and the scale of greening in the areas along the Yangtze River and around the lakes is also expanding daily. In Sichuan Province, 3 million young people are participating in afforestation, having already planted 525 million trees. Young people in 30 counties, including Wenjiang and Mianyang, have also collected over 190,000 jin of seeds of Masson pine, fir, alder, and other tree species, preparing to support seed-deficient areas within the province and send them to young people in Shaanxi Province.
