Response to Criticism and Suggestions

    After the "Reader's Letters Page" criticized the frequent overtime work of some government offices in Tianjin on January 22, the Tianjin Municipal Planning Commission, Statistics Bureau, Grain Bureau, Reception Office, Heping District People's Committee, and the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League all conducted self-examinations. They believed that the criticism in this newspaper was correct and that the main reasons for this situation were the lack of proper and thorough planning of work by the leaders of each unit and the lack of a mass perspective. The General Office of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also wrote a letter stating that the Municipal Party Committee will take effective measures in the future to assist various units in overcoming the phenomenon of overtime work.

    改变机关工作中的忙乱现象
    “读者来信专页”在1月22日对天津市一部分机关经常加班加点的情况提出批评以后，天津市计划委员会、统计局、粮食局、交际处、和平区人民委员会和青年团天津市委会都作了检查。他们认为本报的批评是正确的，并且认为产生这种情况的主要原因是各单位领导人员对工作没有进行妥善周密的安排和缺乏群众观点。中共天津市委会办公厅也来信说：今后市委将采取有效措施来协助各单位克服加班加点的现象。
