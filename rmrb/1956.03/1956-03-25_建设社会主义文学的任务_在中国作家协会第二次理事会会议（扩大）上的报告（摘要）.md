The Task of Building Socialist Literature

—Report (Summary) at the Second Council Meeting (Enlarged) of the Chinese Writers Association—
Zhou Yang

I.

The Second Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers, held in 1953, solemnly called on our writers and artists to actively develop literary and artistic creation and strive to achieve the great goal of socialism. Now, after just over two years, the high tide of the socialist revolution has arrived. In another two or three years, the people of our country will basically complete the historical task of the socialist revolution throughout the country. In the face of such a earth-shaking historical change, what should our literary and art undertakings do? How will it adapt to this situation? People often talk about and lament the phenomenon that literature and art lag behind life. Can we allow this phenomenon to exist for a long time and legitimately? The people are eagerly expecting writers to truly reflect their lives in all aspects in beautiful artistic forms, and expect excellent works to be produced continuously. Can we live up to this legitimate and reasonable expectation?

No! Our literature and art must advance with the people and guide them forward. Our literature and art should meet the people's growing needs and demands for it.

A series of changes are taking place in our country's life from the foundation to the superstructure, and the most profound and fundamental change is the change in people. The process of the formation of new socialist personalities can be seen in the advanced elements of the people. This is the process of transforming the souls of the masses of the people. And the mission of our literature and art is precisely to reflect the people's struggle to transform society and the enthusiasm for building a new life, and to cultivate new socialist personalities. The vast number of young people demand that literature and art give them communist education and cultivate their noble thoughts and feelings. Many of our current works cannot meet their requirements in terms of ideology and art. Due to the continuous improvement of the material life and the increasing cultural demands of the broad masses of people, and due to the early implementation of language reform and the elimination of illiteracy, the number of readers of literary works will increase by tens of thousands, and they will reach out to our writers for works.

Can we meet these requirements of the people? Can our literature change its backward state and move forward in great strides?

In literary and artistic work, as in many other work, right-leaning conservatism has been the main obstacle to our progress. Tolerating the erosion and destruction of the people's literary and art undertakings by bourgeois reactionary ideas and counter-revolutionary elements, losing our due political sensitivity and ideological combat effectiveness on the literary and art front; tolerating various incorrect, unhealthy and decadent tendencies in literary and art work without resolutely opposing them, while at the same time not actively protecting and supporting the progressive factors and new forces in the development of literary and art undertakings; tolerating the abnormal phenomenon that literature and art lag behind life, ignoring the growing demands of the broad masses of people for literature and art, forgetting the responsibilities that writers and artists should bear to the country and the people; all these are significant manifestations of right-leaning conservatism. In the past two years, through a series of struggles on the ideological front, especially the struggle to criticize and expose the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, the reactionary bourgeois idealist ideas and various anti-people activities existing in the literary and art circles have been fatally hit, and the ideas of right-leaning conservatism have also been effectively corrected. In this way, the road has been cleared for the smooth progress of our socialist literary and art undertakings.

With the passage of time, the development of our country and the ideological and technical growth of writers, our literature has definitely taken a big step forward on the track of socialist realism. Since the "May Fourth" Movement, socialist ideals have been the spiritual force that has inspired all upright and progressive writers. Since our country entered the stage of socialist revolution, new and infinitely rich realistic materials have been provided for the creation of socialist realism works. Now our works directly depict the people's struggle to realize the socialist revolution, express the working people's enthusiasm for building a socialist motherland, and show the images of advanced figures with socialist personalities. Socialist builders have become the main protagonists in the works. The entire content of the works reflects to varying degrees the great process of our country from the democratic revolution to the socialist revolution. The works are filled with a new and strong socialist atmosphere. The formulaization, conceptualization and all other tendencies away from realism in creation have been obviously overcome.

The connection between literature and the people has expanded much more than before. From the Second National Congress of Literary and Art Workers in September 1953 to the end of 1955, the national literary publishing institutions published more than two thousand kinds of literary works (single editions). Now the number of prints of each work is not calculated in thousands or even tens of thousands, but in hundreds of thousands or millions. "Sanliwan", "Defend Yan'an" and some other relatively excellent works recently published have been welcomed by the broad masses of readers. The creation of scripts has begun to become active.

One of the most noteworthy and prominent phenomena in the literary and art circles is the rapid growth of new forces. Now the vast majority of literary works published and published throughout the country are written by young writers.

These are the new atmospheres that have appeared in the field of literary creation in the past two or three years.

The task of writers is to create works worthy of our era, our motherland and our people. These works should truly reflect the unprecedented historical changes taking place in a large country with a population of 600 million, and summarize the long history of revolutionary struggle and the rich experience of building socialism of our people in a grand artistic picture; these works should not only have socialist content, but also have their own national form; we should integrate the essence of all cultures in our country for more than 2,000 years and all the advanced experiences of world culture into our artistic creation. We should create works worthy of being called great, or at least lay a good foundation for the creation of great works. Our works should serve the workers, peasants, intellectuals and all working people most widely. This is the glorious responsibility of our generation of writers.

Now we must resolutely abandon the fatalistic and unambitious view that literature and art always lag behind life and can never meet the needs of the people. We should bravely and unreservedly take on the great task of building socialist literature on our shoulders.

II.
　 In the past two or three years, the literary and art circles have not been calm. Like other aspects of social life, they have experienced rapid and complex changes of great significance. We criticized Yu Pingbo's bourgeois idealist views in the study of "Dream of the Red Chamber", and in connection with this, on the one hand, we criticized the "Literary Gazette" for its capitulationism to the bourgeoisie and its bourgeois aristocratic master-style attitude towards new forces, and on the other hand, we carried out a comprehensive criticism of the reactionary bourgeois idealist ideas (including political, philosophical, historical, and literary aspects) represented by Hu Shi in the entire academic circle. And in all the struggles, the exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group was the most complex and intense struggle; its scale and influence were unprecedented in the history of literature; not only the literary and art circles, but also the broad intellectual circles were involved in the debate. This struggle is a reflection of the class struggle situation in our country entering the socialist revolution, and it is also a general liquidation of Hu Feng's reactionary literary and art ideas that have long harmed the literary and art circles. This is the struggle between the line of literature and art serving workers, peasants and soldiers, the line of socialist realism, and the line of anti-people, anti-socialist, and anti-realism; this is the struggle between the Marxist materialist aesthetic view and the bourgeois idealist aesthetic view; politically, this is also a struggle between revolution and counter-revolution.

Literature and art have always been an important department of ideological struggle. Our history of revolutionary literature is a history of struggle against various reactionary "theories" and "factions", which always attempt to separate writers from the only correct line of serving the people with literature and art, and lead writers to the road of separating from the people and even opposing the people.

As revealed in the three batches of materials published in the "People's Daily", Hu Feng had already betrayed the revolution more than 20 years ago and joined the arms of the Kuomintang reactionaries. According to the materials we recently discovered, this traitor originally wrote "Anti-communism Today and Tomorrow" and many other articles frantically slandering and insulting the Communist Party during the bloody white terror days of 1927-28, calling on people to hold on to "iron-like anti-communist will" and unite to "overthrow" the Communist Party. For a long time, he skillfully concealed this sinful history, deceived us, mixed in the ranks of the people and writers, and carried out the task of spies to sabotage the revolution from within for the reactionary rulers.

Now the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group has been completely exposed and defeated. All of Hu Feng's reactionary literary and art theories have been refuted to the point of being riddled with holes by many comrades' articles. Here I will simply talk about one of the most fundamental differences between us and Hu Feng in literary and art thought, that is, the issue of the relationship between literature and art and the people.

The starting point of our Communist Party's literary and art policy is that the working people are not only the creators of all material wealth, but also the creators of all spiritual wealth; literature and art should express the people and be understood by the people; literature and art should meet the requirements and interests of the working people.

Hu Feng's proposition is hostile to us.

He regards the people as the inert force of history or as the force of blind destruction. He especially hates the Chinese people. He believes that the Chinese people are full of "spiritual enslavement wounds." Therefore, it is not accidental that the writers of the Hu Feng faction, especially their representative writer Lu Ling, always portray the people as either stupid pigs who are numb to the point of losing their human senses, or monsters full of "primitive wildness", full of neurotic madness and spasmodic character; the "heroes" in their works are just disguised various extreme individualists. The purpose of their distorted portrayal of the image of the people is nothing more than to make people feel depressed or lose their rationality after reading, and to completely disintegrate and collapse spiritually. The sentimentalism and anti-rationalism unique to the declining class are precisely the characteristics of the outwardly strong but inwardly weak individualism expressed in their works.

Like all representatives of reactionary bourgeois thought, Hu Feng always emphasizes the writer's subjective "sincerity". He even sophistically said that "sincerity" is "Party spirit", and "Party spirit" is "artistic conscience".

Our writers should be sincere, and this is first of all loyalty to the people, and loyalty to the cause of socialism and communism. Being faithful to oneself should be consistent with being faithful to the people.

Hu Feng exaggerates the "uniqueness" of artistic understanding and describes the creative process as very mysterious. He does this, of course, not to help writers understand the different characteristics of artistically reflecting reality from scientifically reflecting reality, and to help writers better grasp the laws of artistic creation, but only to completely separate artistic understanding from scientific understanding, and image thinking from logical thinking, so as to prove that writers' creation has nothing to do with their world outlook, and that their creation only obeys the special "laws" of inspiration and subjective "sincerity"; in this way, on the one hand, he can wantonly spread idealist ideological toxins under the "mysterious" cloak of artistic understanding, and on the other hand, he can reject the role of advanced world outlook and any progressive ideas of the times in the creative process.

We are believers in Marxism-Leninism. We believe that propagating the great world outlook of Marxism-Leninism is the greatest glory of writers, artists, and all other ideological workers. All progressive writers who are willing to become socialist realists should strive to study Marxism-Leninism. The reason why socialist realism is a completely new type of realism in human history is that this artistic method of socialist realism is closely linked to the world outlook of Marxism-Leninism.

The Chinese people's struggle against imperialism and feudalism combined with scientific socialist thought produced the great new democratic revolution, and also produced the progressive revolutionary literature since the "May Fourth" Movement. The life and strength of this literature lies in its organic connection with the people's liberation movement and socialist thought. Hu Feng tried his best to destroy this connection, and his purpose was to make our literature wither and perish, so as to further achieve his goal of obstructing and opposing our country's democratic and socialist revolution.

In connection with the struggle to expose the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group, we opposed the activities of certain sectarian small groups in the literary and art circles. Sectarianists do not put the interests of the country, the people, and the entire literary and art undertaking first, but put the interests of individuals and small groups first. They attempted to create a "special force" in the literary world, refused the supervision of the Party and the people over their work, and adopted an attitude of exclusion and non-cooperation towards many upright writers, both Party members and non-Party members. They spread the decadent bourgeois individualist world outlook among young literary people, promoting that a writer "has everything after writing a book", "pride is a virtue", and so on. Chen Qixia is one of the representatives of this kind of thinking. We resolutely opposed this kind of thinking and activities.

Our task in the future is to continue to carry out a resolute struggle against various reactionary bourgeois ideological manifestations in literature and art, and to use scientific methods to sort out the rich heritage of Chinese literature throughout the ages, study and summarize the vivid experience of the modern literary movement, and build our country's Marxist literary and art theory and literary and art criticism on this basis. At present, the literary and art theory front is still a relatively weak department in our work. There is almost no relatively complete history of Chinese literature written from a Marxist viewpoint, especially the history of modern literature. The rich literary heritage of our country, including the theoretical and critical heritage, has not been scientifically sorted out and promoted. The rich creative experience of modern writers has not been systematically studied and summarized. There is very little exploration of Marxist aesthetics. This backward situation must be changed. In the work of literary and art theory and criticism, we must also oppose the tendency to simplify and vulgarize Marxism.

III.

Now I will talk about the situation in literary and artistic creation.

In the past two or three years, literary and artistic creation, no matter how many shortcomings and problems there are, has made remarkable progress in the breadth and depth of reflecting life.

Rural life and struggle are still the aspects that writers write about the most. In addition to continuing to express the theme of land reform, our writers have begun to depict many new pictures of socialist changes in rural areas. Zhao Shuli's "Sanliwan" is an excellent result in this regard. In this novel, the author truly describes the struggle between socialist advanced forces and backward forces in rural areas, and the various contradictions and conflicts of farmers in production relations, family relations, and love relations with his unique rich knowledge, enthusiasm, and humor about rural areas, showing the scenery of rural new life. The author successfully created the typical images of several old and middle-aged peasants such as "Hututu" and "Chang Youli", and at the same time depicted new figures among the peasants. The author loves the peasants and knows the weaknesses of the peasants as small producers. When he criticizes the backwardness of the peasants, he often reveals a kind and gentle smile. Once the revolutionary energy of the peasants is combined with the socialist thought of the working class, it can emit earth-shaking power. They can not only overthrow the landlord land ownership system for thousands of years, but also abandon their individual ownership of the land they have acquired and resolutely embark on the road of collectivism. The author seems to see less of this aspect of the power of the peasants, or at least has not been able to fully and truly express this aspect. Therefore, the contradictions within the peasants or in their hearts that are unfolded in his works are not very serious or sharp, and the contradictions are resolved relatively easily. The lack of sharp and powerful descriptions of contradictions and conflicts in the works cannot fully reflect the magnificent waves of the times and fully excite the hearts of readers. This weakness also exists in many works by other writers. Ouyang Shan's "A Promising Future" and Wang Xijian's "Welcoming Spring Song", which are also popular with the theme of cooperation, have achieved certain success in handling the sharp class struggle in rural areas and portraying the images of advanced peasants, but the resolution of conflicts and struggles also seems easy. Kang Zhuo and Qin Zhaoyang, in their short story collections "Spring Planting and Autumn Harvest" and "Rural Sketches", reflected the early scenes of the socialist transformation of agriculture in our country, and described the growth of the younger generation in rural areas and their beautiful and bright characters. The common shortcomings of the works in these two collections are the lack of descriptions of major conflicts and struggles in rural areas. Kang Zhuo's style is fresh and simple, and his descriptions of rural life are realistic, but sometimes they are tedious. Qin Zhaoyang's writing style is beautiful, but sometimes it seems to be beautifying life, intentionally rendering life with a pastoral mood. The young writer Li Zhun, in his short story "Can't Go That Way", was the first to artistically express the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism in rural areas, and thus received the attention of the broad masses of readers and the literary and art circles. Later, he wrote the novella "Ice Melting and Snow Disappearing", which expresses the unity of the old and new cooperatives and the large and small cooperatives in the development of the cooperative - the contradiction between collectivism and localism.

Our writers wrote about the great historical theme of the Chinese people's revolutionary war. Du Pengcheng's "Defend Yan'an" created a hero like the protagonist company commander Zhou Dayong who is not afraid of any difficulties, and also wrote about the lovely characters of several other people's fighters, and at the same time tried to depict the outstanding image of the supreme commander of the Northwest battlefield. Chen Qitong's "Thousands of Rivers and Mountains" also focused on portraying characters, expressing the life-and-death battle friendship between a battalion instructor and his comrades, his principled spirit, and his infinite loyalty to the revolutionary cause. However, the authors often couldn't help but let themselves or through the mouths of the characters issued too many abstract discussions about revolutionary integrity, loyalty, revolutionary heroism, optimism, etc., which weakened the moving power and effect of the works. The movie "Dong Cunrui" (screenwriter Ding Hong et al., director Guo Wei) is one of the excellent films produced recently. The author, director, and actors of this film collectively created a vivid line and color to show the growth process of an ordinary soldier from a simple and naive rural teenager to a great communist fighter and his unique personality. Sun Junqing's short story collection "The Riverbank at Dawn" describes the heroic deeds of the people in the old Shandong base area in the armed struggle against domestic and foreign enemies. The author brought us from peaceful life to the cruel years of war not long ago; he truly and enthusiastically wrote about the glorious image of ordinary people who would rather die than submit; Liu Zhixia's "Railway Guerrilla" won the love of the broad masses of readers with the revolutionary legend of the story; Liu Baiyu's "Fighting Happiness" described his reunion with his "old comrades" on the Korean front with his long-standing deep feelings for the People's Liberation Army. Although the author wrote about the common qualities and characteristics of our commanders and fighters, he has not been able to more deeply portray the personality and distinct differences of each commander and fighter, etc.

Industrial construction and workers' struggle are still a relatively weak aspect of literary and artistic creation, and writers need to put more effort into this aspect in the future. Zhou Libo's "Iron Water Rushing" and Lei Jia's "Spring Comes to the Yalu River" describe the arduous struggle of the Party and the working class in the early days of liberation to rapidly restore industry. However, the life reflected in "Iron Water Rushing" is relatively superficial, and the description of character is relatively simple. "Spring Comes to the Yalu River" is too focused on the realistic depiction of details, so it gives people a tedious impression. Xia Yan's "Test" boldly portrayed the negative characters, but the advanced forces seemed a little light, and their victory was written too easily. Wei Wei criticized the stubborn private ownership concepts and habits of small producers left over from the older generation of workers in his short story "Old Chimney".

The ideological changes and progress of intellectuals after liberation are reflected too little in our works. Cao Yu's "Bright Sky" somewhat makes up for the shortcomings in this regard.

Works reflecting the lives of ethnic minorities are increasing not only in poetry but also in drama and novels. The folk oral literature of ethnic minorities is constantly being excavated and sorted out. The two long poems "Ashima" and "Hundred Birds Clothes" are treasures of folk creation that have been sorted out and adapted. The well-known writers among ethnic minorities include the Mongolian poet Na. Sayin Choktu, the young writer Marachinfu (short story collection "Spring's Song of Joy"), the Uyghur poet Teyipjan, and the writer Ziya (play "Bloodstains"), etc.

Children's literature has recently had new major developments. We have Zhang Tianyi's "The Story of Luo Wenyin" and other children's stories and poems that are popular with young readers.

Poetry creation has become active. We have already seen many excellent lyric poems, narrative poems and political satirical poems. Our lyric poetry does not simply express personal emotions, but personal emotions must always be consistent with the emotions of the times, the people, and the class. The poet is the horn of the times. There is no Great Wall separating our lyric poems and narrative poems. Lyricism is to express the feelings of the people, and narration is to narrate the affairs of the people. This is the basic characteristic of our lyric poetry. In recent years, our older generation or experienced poets, whether it is Ai Qing and Tian Jian, Feng Zhi and Yuan Shuipai, Zang Kejia and Yan Chen, Li Ji and Ruan Zhangjing, have published many works. Most of the poets have not been separated from the boiling life of the country and the people. Li Ji brought us back from the distant Yumen the picture of the life of oil miners and prospectors active on the Gobi Desert. And what deserves our special attention is that many talented young poets have appeared, such as Wen Jie and Shao Yanxiang. Poets praise the people, praise the motherland, praise the friendship between all fraternal ethnic groups and the enthusiasm for jointly building a new life. Their praise is not empty, but full of real feelings and rich colors. Their poems express their own different lyrical characteristics.

The working masses of the new China are entering an era of unprecedented enthusiasm. Young people are eager to hear encouraging and combative voices from our poets. But there are still too few such poems. We hope that poets will strengthen their connection with the people, take their masterpieces to the masses to recite, exchange emotions with the masses, and absorb inspiration and strength from the masses. At the same time, poets learning from their national traditions is still one of the key issues for the true massification of our new poetry. If poets often consider the hobbies of the masses and can often learn the skills of driving language and rhythm from our classical poetry and folk poetry, then our new poetry will be mutually recited by the broad masses of people and become truly the people's own poetry.

The people need lyrical works, and they also need satirical works. Poets wrote political satirical poems with the theme of eliminating hidden counter-revolutionary elements. Satirical comedies that are welcomed by the audience have begun to appear on our stage.

We can now say with certainty that our literary creation is moving towards prosperity and prosperity. Writers showed an increasing creative enthusiasm. Many old writers are actively participating in various social activities while diligently carrying out creative work and striving to reflect the new life in their works. In recent years, Lao She has been one of the most diligent writers. He wrote the novel "Nameless Heights Have Names" with the theme of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and also wrote the play "Looking West to Chang'an" based on the true events of a counter-revolutionary political swindler. Ba Jin continued to write enthusiastic sketches expressing the deeds of the heroes who resisted US aggression and aided Korea. Other older writers, such as Cao Yu, Zhang Tianyi, Xia Yan, Sha Ting, and Ai Wu, have resumed their new creations after a considerable period of silence. And what is especially gratifying is that a large number of new forces have poured into the literary and art teams, bringing a fresh breath and vigorous strength to literary creation.

Now can we say that we are already satisfied with the current development of literary creation?

Of course not. Literary creation, in any aspect, is far from meeting the needs of the people. The scope of themes in the works is still very narrow. Film script creation is still lagging behind. And the most important thing is that our creation has not yet reached the level required by the broad masses of readers in terms of ideology and art.

To improve the ideological and artistic level of literary creation, we need to make efforts in many aspects. And for the writers, they must continue to work hard to overcome the formalism, naturalism and all other tendencies away from realism in creation.

Formalism is not a very easy thing to overcome; to overcome it, the decisive key lies in correctly resolving the relationship between writers and life. This includes not only the breadth and depth of writers' contact with life, but also the writers' ability to understand and express life, including the writers' observation of life, enthusiasm, and his artistic skills. The main characteristic of formalism is to simplify the rich and diverse life and character. Now many of our writers have too narrow aspects of contact with life, and their understanding of life is not deep enough, which is the root cause of formalism. Some writers' methods of "experiencing life" have great limitations and one-sidedness. They often only observe the environment and objects they have chosen when they are "experiencing life", rather than carefully observing everything around them and all people at any time and place. Even when he is observing the object he has chosen, he often sets a subjective "framework" in advance, such as A is a "positive character", B is a "negative character", and the "positive character" or "negative character" should have such and such characteristics, and then according to this "framework" go to the object to find what the author needs and wants to find, so he simplifies and one-sidedly the character of people. In this way, writers cannot get a comprehensive and true understanding of life. To grasp the truth of life, writers need to make multi-faceted observations and in-depth research on life. Here, the writer's serious study and research of Marxism-Leninism and the Party and the state's policies are of decisive significance. Writers must also have broad knowledge.

The most important thing for writers to correctly and deeply understand life is to actively participate in the struggle to change life, maintain a close connection with the people who are fighting, fight and advance with them, and not be separated from the people's struggle or take a bystander attitude towards this struggle.

Now we all know the importance of expressing the contradictions and conflicts of life in the works and the harmfulness of the "no conflict theory". But why are many authors still often afraid or not good at expressing the contradictions and conflicts in life? This is mainly because writers have not taken an active participating attitude towards the people's struggle. They often stand outside the contradiction between the new and the old, and have not actively struggled with the advanced elements of the people to oppose the old and support the new. Therefore, their expression of positive characters is always lacking in strength and cannot write these characters into active, aggressive, and lively figures. The exposure and whipping of negative phenomena is not so profound and powerful. The reason for this situation is also due to the lack of political and artistic courage of some writers, who see the conflicts and contradictions in life and dare not express them; or the lack of artistic generalization ability, and are not good at refining and concentrating the conflicts and contradictions in life into the conflicts and contradictions in the works. Writers must be good at observing, analyzing and synthesizing various different contradictions, and grasp the most essential things of the contradictions, and make concentrated and prominent expressions.

Now our writers pay more attention to the description of character and inner life. But why are there still very few images created very successfully in the works? One of the important reasons is that the authors often leave the struggle and action, and carve "character" in isolation and statically, or simply portray the external physiological characteristics of the characters as the character characteristics of the characters, or forcibly add some descriptions of so-called "private life" that do not help much in expressing the character of the characters.

The reason for the tendency of formalism in the works is also due to some writers not correctly understanding that art is a special form of reflecting reality. Artistically reflecting reality and scientifically reflecting reality have common laws, and each has its own different special laws. What is common is that both science and literature and art are reflections of life and reality; what is different is that science reflects through concepts, while literature and art reflect through images. Literature and art always help people understand the world through individual, concrete and perceptual images, and arouse people's strong feelings of joy or disgust towards beautiful or ugly things in life. Expressing the general through the individual, and expressing the essence through the phenomenon; this is the principle of artistic generalization, the principle of typification. Writers with a tendency to formalism violate and destroy this law of artistic creation. When observing and expressing life, they do not start from the specific reality of life, but from abstract concepts or policy clauses about life; they do not express life according to the entire complexity and diversity of life, but according to a certain "formula", thus simplifying and one-sidedly life. In reality, life is originally a complete thing. However, formalists artificially divide life. The plots become monotonous, and the characters become simple incarnations of "correct", "progressive" or "wrong", "backward". Therefore, although the events described in the works have time and place, and the characters also have surnames and names, they do not have "individual" or "special" things, so they cannot embody the unity of "individual" and "general"; in Marx and Engels' words, it is "personality dissolves into general principles". The simplification of character in many works is often related to the simplification of the plot. Our writers often do not pay attention to or are not good at choosing tortuous and fascinating plots to form the clues for the development of character. Rich thematic ideas are inseparable from rich plots.

In order to overcome formalism, some writers easily go to the road of naturalism. We cannot say that there are some or one writer who is already a representative of naturalism, but it can be said that this tendency is indeed revealed in some writers' articles or works. Photograph-like recording of life, listing phenomena, lack of due selection and artistic tailoring for the facts described in the works, taking a detached and indifferent attitude towards the fate of the characters they describe, and describing the thoughts and feelings of the characters as low-level and vulgar. Are all these not various manifestations of naturalism? Formalism describes the rich and diverse life as simple, while naturalism makes lengthy and tedious descriptions of individual unimportant facts in life, which are exactly the opposite of each other. Naturalism not only did not overcome formalism, but even guided creation to a more dangerous road, because it distorted life more in a certain sense. Whether it is formalism or naturalism, both violate the fundamental principle of creation of "the description of typical character in a typical environment", and are subjective methods of describing life.

We know that naturalism has various manifestations. Looking at society and people from a biological point of view is one of the most important characteristics of naturalism. In many naturalistic works, people are not social people, but biological or pathological people. They write people as animals separated from society, and attribute people's lives and behaviors to biological phenomena. They oppose art to describe the lofty and beautiful things in life, and take the insignificant and vulgar things as the center of artistic attention. In connection with this, the expression method of naturalism is to mechanically and photographically record facts. They reject generalization and typification, and are obsessed with tedious descriptions of trivial, superficial, and accidental phenomena. As a result, it is bound to distort reality and guide readers to vulgar and attention-to-detail tastes.

Our literature and art educate the people in the spirit of communism, but it conducts this education from an aesthetic point of view, that is to say, writers should use their talents and skills to enlighten people's aesthetics and cultivate people's artistic taste, and arouse people's strong feelings of love or hate for the characters in the works. Obviously, both formalism and naturalistic works lack this artistic infection power.

Our writers, especially young writers, must study and master skills. The view of despising skills is harmful. A writer's skills are certainly tempered from his continuous observation and expression of life; but skills are also the accumulation of experience of our ancestors for many years, and it is passed on to us as a heritage and a method, without which we cannot move a step. We should learn from all the great writers in the world, especially from the writers of our country throughout the ages. Now, the tendency to despise national heritage still exists seriously among our writers and artists. Writers do not study the traditions of Chinese novels and poetry enough. This phenomenon must be changed. Lu Xun's creation pioneered the history of the entire new literature; the heritage he left us is the most intimate, precious and valuable of all literary heritages; we must first seriously study it. Guo Moruo's "Goddess" opened up an era of new poetry. Writers Mao Dun, Lao She, Ba Jin, Cao Yu, and Zhao Shuli are all masters of contemporary language art.

Readers feel in many works that writers lack rich emotions, and even some emotions are false. Why did some of our writers express such surging emotions in their works in the past, in the stage of democratic revolution, but now that they have entered the era of the great socialist revolution, that enthusiasm has faded instead? This is a question worthy of serious attention. Our outstanding poet, Comrade Ai Qing, who wrote "To the Sun" and "Torch", why did he only bring us back a "Black Eel" with a folk tale love story as the theme when he arrived on the Zhoushan front line? Why doesn't he use the power that a revolutionary poet should have to praise the heroes of our coastal defense? How much we all hope that he and other old poets will write good poems!

Our writers can only have the emotions of the people if they maintain close ties with the people, especially the people in struggle, and share the interests and breathe together with the people. The idea of serving the people faithfully and unconditionally and the enthusiasm to dedicate themselves to the great cause of socialist communism are the real driving forces for our writers to write excellent works. Let the sparks of enthusiasm radiate forever in the hearts of our writers!

After this meeting, I believe that large numbers of writers will go to factories, mines, construction sites, rural areas, border areas, the national defense front, and various fronts where socialist construction and socialist transformation are being carried out in full swing. Our meeting should become a conference to mobilize writers to go to the life of the people. The vast number of young literary people and many cadres in various work positions who love literature and have literary accomplishments are moved by the life they have experienced and have the impulse and desire to write. Our meeting should become a conference to widely attract all new forces into the literary ranks.

    ——在中国作家协会第二次理事会会议（扩大）上的报告（摘要）——
    周扬
    一
    1953年召开的中国文学艺术工作者第二次代表大会，向我们的作家、艺术家提出了积极发展文学艺术创作，为实现社会主义的伟大目标而奋斗的庄严号召。现在，经过了仅仅两年多的时间，社会主义革命的高潮已经到来，再有两三年的工夫，我国人民就将在全国范围内基本上完成社会主义革命的历史任务。在这样一个翻天覆地的历史变革的形势面前，我们的文学艺术事业应当怎么办呢？它将如何来适应这种形势呢？人们经常谈论和慨叹文学艺术落后于生活的现象，我们能够让这种现象长久地、合法地存在下去吗？人民迫切地期待作家用优美的艺术形式真实地反映他们各方面的生活，期待优秀的作品源源不断地产生，我们能够辜负这种正当的、合理的期望吗？
    不能！我们的文学艺术必须和人民一同前进，并且引导人民前进。我们的文学艺术应当满足人民对它的日益增长的需要和要求。
    我国生活中正发生着从基础到上层建筑的一连串的变化，其中最深刻的最根本的一个变化，是人的变化。在人民中的先进分子身上，可以看出新的社会主义个性形成的过程。这是千千万万人民群众灵魂改造的过程。而我们的文学艺术的使命，就正是要反映人民改造社会的斗争和建设新生活的热情，培养新的社会主义的个性。广大青年要求文学艺术给他们以共产主义的教育，培养他们的高尚的思想和情感。我们现在的许多作品在思想上和艺术上都不能满足他们的要求了。由于广大人民物质生活不断改善和文化要求不断增长，由于提早实行文字改革和消灭文盲，文学作品的读者将成千成万地增加，他们会伸出手来向我们的作家要作品。
    我们能够满足人民的这些要求吗？我们的文学能够改变自己的落后状态，而大踏步地前进吗？
    在文学艺术工作上，也像在其他许多工作上一样，右倾保守主义曾经是我们前进的最主要的障碍。容忍资产阶级反动思想和反革命分子对人民文艺事业的腐蚀和破坏，丧失我们在文艺战线上应有的政治锐敏性和思想战斗力；容忍文艺工作中各种不正确的、不健康的和腐朽的倾向，而不去坚决地加以反对，另一方面又不积极地保护和扶植文艺事业发展中的进步因素和新生力量；容忍文学艺术落后于生活的不正常的现象，漠视广大人民群众对文学艺术的日益增长的要求，忘记作家艺术家对国家和人民所应负的责任；所有这些，就都是右倾保守主义的显著的表现。两年来，经过思想战线上的一系列的斗争，特别是批判和揭露胡风反革命集团的斗争，文艺界存在的反动的资产阶级唯心主义思想和各种反人民的活动受到了致命的打击，右倾保守主义的思想也得到了有力的纠正。这样，就为我们的社会主义文艺事业的顺利前进扫清了道路。
    随着时代的推移，我们国家的发展和作家在思想上、技巧上的成长，我们的文学已经在社会主义现实主义的轨道上确定地前进了一大步。从“五四”以来，社会主义理想一直是鼓舞一切正直的进步的作家的精神力量。自从我国进入社会主义革命阶段，就为社会主义现实主义作品的创造提供了新的、无限丰富的现实材料。现在我们的作品中直接描写了人民为实现社会主义革命的斗争，表现了劳动人民建设社会主义祖国的热情，出现了具有社会主义个性的先进人物的形象。社会主义的建设者成为了作品中的主要主人公。作品的整个内容在各种不同的程度上反映了我国从民主主义革命到社会主义革命的伟大过程。作品弥漫了新的、浓郁的社会主义的气息。创作上的公式化、概念化及其他一切脱离现实主义的倾向有了明显的克服。
    文学和人民的联系比以前扩大得多了。从1953年9月第二次文代会到1955年底，国家文学出版机关出版的文学作品（单行本）在两千种以上。现在每本作品的印数，不是以千册甚至不是以万册计算，而是以十万百万册计算了。“三里湾”、“保卫延安”以及最近出版的其他一些比较优秀的作品，受到了广大读者的欢迎。剧本创作开始活跃了。
    文艺界最值得注意的、突出的现象之一是新生力量正在迅速地成长。现在全国出版和发表的文学作品，绝大部分是出于青年作家的手笔。
    这些就是两三年来在文学创作领域内所出现的新的气象。
    作家的任务，是创造出毋愧于我们这个时代，毋愧于我们的祖国和人民的作品。这些作品，应当真实地反映出在一个六万万人口的大国里正在发生的空前未有的历史变化，把我国人民长期革命斗争历史和建设社会主义的丰富经验，概括在宏大的艺术画卷里；这些作品不只要具有社会主义的内容，而且要具有自己民族的形式；我们应当把我国两千多年来全部文化的精华和世界文化的一切先进经验都融合在我们的艺术创造中。我们应当创造出够得上称为伟大的作品，至少为产生伟大的作品打下良好的基础。我们的作品应当最广泛地为工人、农民知识分子和一切劳动人民服务。这就是我们这一代的作家光荣的职责。
    现在我们必须坚决抛弃认为文学艺术总是落后于生活的，总是不能满足人民需要的那种宿命论的、不长进的观点。我们应当勇敢地、责无旁贷地把建设社会主义文学的伟大任务担在我们的双肩上。
    二  
　  两三年来，文艺界并不是风平浪静的，它和社会生活的其他方面一样经历了急遽而复杂的具有重大意义的变化。我们批判了俞平伯在关于“红楼梦”研究中的资产阶级唯心主义观点，并且和这相联系，一方面批判了“文艺报”所表现的对资产阶级的投降主义和对新生力量的资产阶级贵族老爷式的态度，另一方面在整个学术界进行了对以胡适为代表的反动的资产阶级唯心主义思想（包括政治、哲学、历史、文学各方面）的全面批判。而在所有的斗争中，胡风反革命集团的揭露却是最复杂、最激烈的一场斗争；其规模之大，影响之广，在文学史上是空前的；不但文艺界，而且广大的知识界都卷入论战。这场斗争是我国进入社会主义革命阶级斗争形势的一个反映，同时也是对于长期危害文艺界的胡风的反动文艺思想的总清算。这是文艺为工农兵服务的路线、社会主义现实主义的路线和反人民、反社会主义、反现实主义的路线的斗争；这是马克思主义唯物主义的美学观点和资产阶级唯心主义的美学观点的斗争；在政治上这又是革命和反革命的斗争。
    文学艺术从来是思想斗争的重要部门。我们的革命文学史就是一部和各种反动的“理论”和“派别”作斗争的历史，这些“理论”和“派别”总是企图使作家脱离文艺为人民服务这个唯一正确的路线，而把作家引导到脱离人民以至反对人民的道路上去。
    如“人民日报”发表的三批材料所揭露的，胡风早在二十多年前，就背叛了革命，投到国民党反动派的怀抱里去了。根据我们最近发现的材料，这个叛徒在1927——28年的血腥的白色恐怖的日子里，原来就写了“反共的今天和明天”及其他好多篇疯狂地诽谤和侮辱共产党的文章，号召人们抱定“铁一般的反共意志”，一致起来“打倒”共产党。长期以来，他巧妙地隐瞒了他的这段罪恶历史，骗过了我们，混在人民和作家的队伍里，替反动统治者执行从内部来破坏革命的奸细的任务。
    现在胡风反革命集团是已经彻底地被揭露、被击破了。胡风的全部反动文艺理论，已被许多同志的文章驳得体无完肤。我在这里只简单说一说我们和胡风在文艺思想上一个最根本的分歧点，即文艺和人民的关系的问题。
    我们共产党的文艺政策的出发点，是认为劳动人民不但是一切物质财富而且是一切精神财富的创造者；文艺应当表现人民并且为人民所理解；文艺应当适合劳动人民的要求和利益。
    胡风的主张正是和我们敌对的。
    他把人民看成历史的惰性的力量或者看成盲目破坏的力量。他特别地仇视中国人民。他认为中国人民身上尽是“精神奴役创伤”。因此，不是偶然的，胡风派的作家，特别是他们的代表作家路翎总是把人民表现为不是麻木到连人的感觉都失去的蠢猪，就是充满了“原始野性”，充满了神经质的疯狂性、痉挛性的怪物；他们作品中的“英雄”，只是一些化了装的各色各样的极端的个人主义者。他们这样歪曲地来描写人民的形象，其目的无非是要使人们读了之后变得意志消沉或丧失理性，在精神上完全瓦解和崩溃而已。殁落阶级所特有的感伤主义和反理性主义正是他们作品中所表现的那种外强中干的个人主义的特色。
    正像所有反动的资产阶级思想的代表者一样，胡风总是强调作家主观的“真诚”。他甚至诡辩到这样程度，把“真诚”说成就是“党性”，“党性”就是“艺术良心”。
    我们的作家是应当真诚的，这首先是对于人民的忠诚，对于社会主义、共产主义事业的忠诚。忠实于自己应当是和忠实于人民相一致的。
    胡风夸大艺术认识的“特殊性”，把创作过程描写得十分神秘化。他这样做当然不是为了帮助作家理解艺术地反映现实有和科学地反映现实不同的特点，帮助作家更好地掌握艺术创作的规律，而只是为了把艺术认识和科学认识、形象思维和逻辑思维完全割裂开来，借以证明作家的创作同他们的世界观毫无关系，他们的创作只服从于灵感和主观“真诚”的特殊“规律”；这样，他一方面可以在艺术认识的“神秘”的外衣之下放肆地散播唯心主义的思想毒素，另一方面他可以排斥先进的世界观和时代的任何进步思想在创作过程中的作用。
    我们是马克思列宁主义的信奉者。我们认为宣传马克思列宁主义的伟大世界观是文学家、艺术家及其他一切思想工作者的莫大光荣。一切进步的，愿意成为社会主义现实主义者的作家都应当努力学习马克思列宁主义。社会主义现实主义之所以是人类历史上的一种完全新型的现实主义，就是因为社会主义现实主义这种艺术方法是和马克思列宁主义的世界观紧密地联系着的。
    中国人民反帝反封建的斗争和科学的社会主义思想相结合，产生了伟大的新民主主义革命，也产生了从“五四”以来的进步的革命的文学，这种文学的生命和力量就在于它同人民解放运动和社会主义思想的有机联系。胡风竭力破坏这种联系，其目的就是要使我们的文学陷于枯萎和灭亡，从而进一步达到他阻挠和反对我国民主主义和社会主义革命的目的。
    和揭露胡风反革命集团的斗争相联系，我们反对了文艺界某些宗派性小集团的活动。宗派主义者不把国家、人民和整个文艺事业的利益放在第一位，而把个人和小集团的利益放在第一位。他们企图在文坛上造成一种“特殊势力”，拒绝党和人民对他们工作的监督，对许多党的和非党的正派作家采取排斥的不合作的态度。他们在文学青年中传播资产阶级的腐朽的个人主义的世界观，宣传什么一个作家“写出了一本书就有了一切”、“骄傲是美德”等等。陈企霞就是这种思想的代表者之一。我们坚决地反对了这一类的思想和活动。
    我们今后的任务就是：继续对文艺上各种反动的资产阶级思想的表现进行坚决的斗争，并且用科学方法来整理我国历代文学的丰富遗产，研究和总结现代文学运动的生动经验，在这个基础上来建设我国的马克思主义的文艺理论和文艺批评。目前，文艺理论战线仍是我们工作中一个比较薄弱的部门。用马克思主义观点写的比较完善的中国文学史，特别是现代文学史，几乎还没有一本。对我国丰富的文学遗产，包括理论批评遗产，还没有给以科学的整理和发扬。对现代作家的丰富的创作经验也没有系统地加以研究和总结。马克思主义美学的探讨是很少的。这种落后状况，必须改变。在文艺理论批评工作中，我们还必须反对对马克思主义的简单化、庸俗化的倾向。
    三
　  现在我来谈一谈文艺创作方面的情况。
    两三年来，文艺创作，不管还有多少缺点和毛病，在反映生活的广度和深度上都有了值得注目的进展。
    农村的生活和斗争仍是作家写得最多的一个方面。我们的作家除了继续表现土地改革的题材外已经开始给我们描绘了不少关于农村中社会主义变革的新的图画。赵树理的“三里湾”就是这个方面的一个优秀成果。在这篇小说中，作者以他特有的关于农村的丰富知识，热情和幽默，真实地描写了农村中社会主义先进力量和落后力量之间的斗争，农民在生产关系、家庭关系和恋爱关系上的种种矛盾冲突，显示了农村新生活的风光。作者成功地创造了“糊涂涂”“常有理”等几个老中农的典型形象，同时描写了农民中的新人物。作者热爱农民，也深知农民作为小生产者的弱点，他在批判农民的落后的时候，就往往流露出亲切的温和的微笑。农民的革命精力一经和工人阶级的社会主义的思想相结合，就能够发出翻天覆地的力量，他们不但能够推翻几千年来的地主土地所有制，而且能够抛弃他们对已经取得的土地的个体所有制而坚决地走上集体主义的道路。作者对于农民的力量的这一方面似乎看得比较少，至少没有能够把这个方面充分地真实地表现出来。因此，在他作品中所展开的农民内部或他们内心中的矛盾就都不是很严重，很尖锐的，矛盾解决得都比较容易。作品中对矛盾冲突的描写不够尖锐、有力，不能充分反映时代的壮阔波澜和充分激动读者的心灵，这个弱点，在其他作家的许多作品中也是存在的。同样以合作化为题材而受到欢迎的欧阳山的“前途似锦”和王希坚的“迎春曲”，处理了农村中尖锐的阶级斗争在刻划先进农民的形象上取得了一定的成功，但是对于冲突和斗争的解决也显得轻易了。康濯和秦兆阳在他们的短篇集“春种秋收”和“农村散记”中，反映了我国农业社会主义改造初期的情景，描写了农村中年青一代的成长和他们美好明朗的性格。这两个集子中的作品的共同缺点是缺乏对农村中重大冲突和斗争的描写。康濯的风格是清新朴素的，他对农村生活的描写是逼真的，有时却流于烦琐。秦兆阳的笔调是优美的，但有时显得是在美化生活，有意地给生活渲染上一种牧歌式的情调。青年作家李准在他的短篇“不能走那条路”中，最早地从艺术上表现了农村中社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，因而受到了广大读者和文艺界的注意，后来他又写了以表现合作社发展过程中新老社和大小社的团结——集体主义和本位主义的矛盾为主题的中篇“冰化雪消”。
    我们的作家写了中国人民革命战争的巨大历史性的主题。杜鹏程的“保卫延安”创造了主人公连长周大勇这样一个不怕任何困难的英雄，也写出了其他几个人民战士的可爱的性格，同时尝试地描绘了西北战场最高指挥者的卓越形象。陈其通的“万水千山”也着重地描写了人物，表现了一个营教导员和他的战友们的生死与共的战斗友谊，他的原则精神和对革命事业的无限忠心。但是作者们时常情不自禁地让自己或通过人物的口发出了关于革命气节、忠诚、革命英雄主义、乐观主义一类的过多的抽象的议论，反而减弱了作品感人的力量和效果。电影“董存瑞”（编剧丁洪等，导演郭维）是最近出产的优秀的影片之一。这个影片的作者、导演和演员以他们集体的创造，用鲜明的线条和色彩表现出了一个普通士兵从单纯、幼稚的农村少年变为伟大的共产主义战士的成长过程和他的独特的个性。孙峻青的短篇集“黎明的河边”，描写了山东老根据地人民在反对国内外敌人的武装斗争中的种种英雄事迹。作者把我们从和平生活中带到了过去不久的残酷的遍地烽火的年代；他真实地充满热情地写出了普通人民的宁死不屈的光辉形象；刘知侠的“铁道游击队”，以故事的革命传奇性赢得了广大读者的喜爱，刘白羽的“战斗的幸福”以他对人民解放军素有的深厚感情描写了他在朝鲜前线和他的“老战友”们的重新会面。作者虽然写出了我们的指战员们的共同的品质和特点，却还没有能够更深刻地刻划出各个指战员的个性和鲜明的差异等。
    工业建设和工人斗争仍然是文艺创作中的一个比较薄弱的方面，需要作家们今后在这方面付出更多的努力。周立波的“铁水奔流”和雷加的“春天来到了鸭绿江”，描写了党和工人阶级在解放初期为迅速恢复工业所进行的艰苦的斗争。但是“铁水奔流”中所反映的生活比较表面，人物性格的描写比较简单。“春天来到了鸭绿江”又太偏重细节真实的刻划，以致给人以烦琐的印象。夏衍的“考验”对反面人物作了大胆的刻划，但把先进力量写得似乎有些轻飘，把他们的胜利也就写得过于容易了。魏巍在他的短篇“老烟筒”中批判了老一代工人身上所残留的小生产者的顽固的私有观念和习惯。
    知识分子在解放以后的思想变化和进步在我们的作品中被反映得太少了。曹禺的“明朗的天”多少弥补了这一方面的缺陷。
    反映少数民族生活的作品，不但在诗歌方面，而且在戏剧小说方面，都在增多起来。少数民族的民间口头文学正不断地被发掘和整理。“阿诗玛”和“百鸟衣”两首长诗就是经过整理和改编的民间创作的珍品。少数民族中为大家所知的作家有蒙族的诗人纳·赛音朝克图，青年作家玛拉沁夫（短篇集“春的喜歌”），维吾尔族的诗人铁依甫江，作家孜亚（剧本“血迹”）等。
    少年儿童文学最近有了新的重大的发展。我们有了张天翼的“罗文应的故事”和其他一些受广大少年读者欢迎的儿童故事和诗歌。
    诗歌创作活跃起来了。我们已经看到了不少优秀的抒情诗、叙事诗和政治讽刺诗。我们的抒情诗，不是单纯地表现个人情感的，个人情感总是要和时代的、人民的、阶级的情感相一致。诗人是时代的号角。在我们的抒情诗和叙事诗之间，并没有万里长城隔着，抒情是抒人民之情，叙事是叙人民之事。这就是我们的抒情诗的基本特点。近年来，我们老一辈的或者有经验的诗人，不论是艾青和田间，冯至和袁水拍，臧克家和严辰，李季和阮章竞，都发表了不少的作品。诗人中的大多数都没有脱离国家和人民的沸腾的生活。李季从辽远的玉门给我们带回了活跃在戈壁滩上的油矿工人和勘探队员的生活的图画。而特别值得我们注意的是已经出现了不少有才能的青年诗人，如闻捷、邵燕祥等。诗人们歌颂人民，歌颂祖国，歌颂各兄弟民族的友谊和共同建设新生活的热情。他们的歌颂不是空洞的，而是充满了真实的感情和丰富的色彩。他们的诗表现了各自不同的抒情特点。
    新中国的劳动群众正进入到一个空前的热情奔放的时代。青年们渴望从我们的诗人那里听到富于鼓舞性和战斗性的声音。可是这样的诗歌还是太少了。我们希望诗人们加强和人民的联系，带着自己的得意之作到群众中去朗诵，和群众的情感互相交流，并且从群众那里吸取灵感和力量。同时诗人们向自己的民族传统学习，仍然是我们的新诗真正群众化的关键问题之一。如果诗人们经常考虑到群众的爱好，又能经常从我国古典诗歌、民间诗歌那里学到驱使语言和韵律的技巧，那么，我们的新诗歌就会在广大群众的口头上互相传诵，变成真正人民自己的诗歌。
    人民需要抒情作品，也需要讽刺作品。诗人们写了以肃清暗藏反革命分子为题材的政治讽刺诗。在我们的舞台上已经开始出现了受到观众欢迎的讽刺喜剧。
    我们现在可以有把握地说：我国的文学创作正在走向旺盛和繁荣。作家们表现了日益高涨的创作热情。不少老作家们在一面积极地参加各种社会活动，一面勤奋地进行着创作劳动，并且努力把新生活反映到了自己的作品里来。几年来，老舍是写作最勤的作家之一。他写了以抗美援朝为题材的小说“无名高地有了名”，又写了取材于一个反革命政治骗子的真实事件的剧本“西望长安”。巴金继续写了表现抗美援朝的英雄们的事迹的热情的速写。其他较老的作家，如曹禺、张天翼、夏衍、沙汀、艾芜等，都在相当长期的沉默之后重新开始了他们新的创作。而格外值得高兴的是大批新生力量涌到文艺队伍中来，给文学创作带来了清新的气息和刚健的力量。
    现在我们能够说，对目前文学创作发展的状况已经可以满意了吗？
    当然不能。文学创作无论从哪方面说都远远不能满足人民的需要。作品取材的范围还很不广阔。电影剧本创作仍然是落后的。而最重要的是，现在我们的创作在思想上和艺术上都还没有达到广大读者所要求的水平。
    要提高文学创作的思想和艺术水平，需要我们作多方面的努力。而在作家方面来说，必须继续努力克服创作上的公式主义、自然主义及其他一切脱离现实主义的倾向。
    公式主义并不是十分容易克服的东西；要克服它，决定关键就在于正确地解决作家和生活的关系，这不但包括作家接触生活的广度和深度，而且也包括作家认识和表现生活的能力，包括作家对生活的观察力、热情和他的艺术技巧。公式主义的主要特征是把丰富多样的生活和人物性格加以简单化。现在我们许多作家接触生活的方面太窄，而对生活的理解又不深，这是产生公式主义的根本原因。有些作家“体验生活”的方法带有很大的局限性和片面性，他们往往只是在“体验生活”的时候，对他所选定的环境和对象进行观察，而不是随时随地地留心地观察自己周围的一切事物和一切人们。甚至就在他观察他所选定的对象的时候，也往往先设定一个主观的“框框”，如甲是“正面人物”，乙是“反面人物”，“正面人物”或“反面人物”应当具有如何如何的特点等，然后按照这个“框框”在对象身上去寻找作者所需要的和愿意寻找的东西，因而就把人们的性格简单化、片面化了。这样作家对于生活就不能得到全面的真正的理解。要把握生活的真实，是需要作家对生活作多方面的观察和深入的研究的。在这里，作家认真地学习和研究马克思列宁主义和党与国家的政策具有决定的意义。作家还必须具备广博的知识。
    作家要正确地深刻地认识生活，最重要的是积极参加变革生活的斗争，和进行斗争的人们保持血肉相关的联系，和他们一同斗争，一同前进，不脱离人民的斗争或对这种斗争采取旁观的态度。
    现在我们大家都知道作品中表现生活的矛盾和冲突的重要以及“无冲突论”的有害了。可是为什么许多作者还是常常害怕或者不善于表现生活中的矛盾和冲突呢？这主要地就是由于作家对于人民的斗争还没有采取积极参预的态度，他们往往站在新和旧的矛盾之外，而没有和人民中的先进分子一道，积极地为反对旧事物和支持新事物而斗争；因而他们表现正面人物就总是缺乏力量，不能够把这些人物写成主动的，进攻的，生龙活虎的，而对于反面现象的揭露和鞭挞也不那么深刻和有力。造成这种情况的原因，还由于一些作家缺乏政治上和艺术上的勇气，看到了生活
  中的冲突矛盾不敢表现；或者缺乏艺术概括的能力，不善于把生活中的冲突矛盾加以提炼集中，变为作品中的冲突矛盾。作家必须善于观察，分析和综合各种不同的矛盾，而抓到矛盾中最本质的东西，加以集中的、突出的表现。
    现在我们的作家比较注意描写人物性格和内心生活了。可是为什么在作品中创造得很成功的形象还是很少呢？重要原因之一也在于作者常常离开斗争和行动，孤立地静止地去刻划“性格”，或者单纯地把人物外表的生理特征当作人物的性格特征来描绘，或者硬加一些对于表现人物性格并没有多少帮助的所谓“私生活”的描写。
    造成作品中公式主义倾向的原因，还由于一些作家没有正确地理解艺术是反映现实的一种特殊形式。艺术地反映现实和科学地反映现实有共同的规律，也有各自不同的特殊的规律。共同的是科学和文学艺术都是生活和现实的反映；不同的是科学通过概念，而文学艺术则通过形象来反映。文学艺术总是通过个别的、具体感性的形象来帮助人们认识世界，而且唤起人们对于生活中的美好的事物或丑恶的事物的喜悦或厌恶的感情。通过个别表现一般，通过现象表现本质；这就是艺术概括的原则，典型化的原则。具有公式主义倾向的作家则违反和破坏艺术创作的这种规律，他们在观察和表现生活的时候，不从生活的具体实际出发，而从关于生活的抽象概念或政策条文出发；不按照生活的全部复杂性和多样性来表现生活，而按照一定的“公式”去表现生活，因而把生活简单化，片面化。在现实中，生活本来是完整的东西。但是公式主义者却人为地把生活加以割裂。情节成为千篇一律，人物成为单纯的“正确”、“进步”或“错误”、“落后”的化身。所以虽然作品中所描写的事件有时间也有地点，人物也有姓有名，但它们身上却没有“个别”或“特殊”的东西，因而也就无法体现“个别”和“一般”的统一；照马克思、恩格斯的话来说，就是“个性溶解于一般的原则之中”了。许多作品中人物性格的简单化又常常是和故事情节的简单化相关联的。我们的作家往往不注意或不善于选择曲折的引人入胜的情节来构成人物性格发展的线索。丰富的主题思想是和丰富的情节分不开的。
    为了克服公式主义，有的作家就很容易地走到了自然主义的道路上去。我们现在还不能说有哪一些或哪一个作家已经是自然主义倾向的代表者，但可以说在相当一些作家的这篇或那篇作品中却的确表露出了这种倾向。照相式地纪录生活，罗列现象，对于作品中所描写的事实缺乏应有的选择和艺术的剪裁，对自己所描写的人物的命运采取超然的冷眼旁观的态度，把人物的思想感情描写成低级的、庸俗的。所有这些，难道不都是自然主义的种种表现吗？公式主义把丰富多样的生活描写成简单的，而自然主义却对生活中个别的不重要的事实作冗长而烦琐的描写，两者正好相反相成。自然主义不但没有把公式主义克服，而且甚至把创作引导到更危险的道路上去，因为它在某种意义上把生活更加歪曲了。无论是公式主义或自然主义，都是违反“典型环境中典型性格的描写”这一根本的创作原则的，都是主观主义地描写生活的方法。
    我们知道，自然主义有各种各样的表现。用生物主义的观点来看社会和人，是自然主义的一个最重要的特点。在许多自然主义者的作品中，人物不是社会的人，而是生物学的或病理学的人。他们把人写成脱离社会的动物，把人的生活和行为都归结为生物学的现象。他们反对艺术去描写生活中的崇高的优美的事物，而把藐小、庸俗的东西作为艺术注意的中心。和这相联系，自然主义的表现方法，是机械地、照像式地记载事实，他们摈弃概括和典型化，而醉心于对琐屑的、外表的、偶然现象的烦琐的描绘。其结果，必然歪曲现实，并且把读者引导到庸俗的、注意琐细事情的趣味上去。
    我们的文艺是以共产主义精神教育人民的，但它是从美感上进行这种教育的，就是说作家应当用自己的才能和技巧来启发人们的美感和培养人们的艺术趣味，唤起人们对于作品中的人物喜爱或憎恶的强烈感情。显然，公式主义或自然主义的作品都缺乏这种艺术感染力量。
    我们的作家，特别是青年作家必须学习和掌握技巧。轻视技巧的观点，是有害的。一个作家的技巧固然是从他不断地观察和表现生活中锻炼出来的；但技巧又是我们的先人多少年代经验的积累，它作为一种遗产，一种方法传给了我们，没有它，我们是一步也不能走的。我们应当向世界上一切伟大作家学习，特别是向我们祖国历代的作家学习。现在我们的作家、艺术家中，轻视民族遗产的倾向还是严重存在的。作家们研究中国小说和诗歌的传统太不够了。这种现象必须改变。鲁迅的创作开创了整个新文学的历史；他留给我们的遗产是一切文学遗产中对我们最亲切的，也是最宝贵的和最有价值的；我们必须首先认真地加以研究。郭沫若的“女神”开辟了一个新诗的时代。作家茅盾、老舍、巴金、曹禺、赵树理都是当代语言艺术的大师。
    读者们在很多作品中感觉到作家缺乏充沛的感情，甚至有些感情是虚伪的。为什么我们有些作家在过去，在民主革命阶段，曾经在自己的作品中表现了那么澎湃的感情，现在进到了伟大的社会主义革命的时代那股热情反而消退了呢？这是一个值得严重注意的问题。我们出色的诗人，写过“向太阳”、“火把”的艾青同志，为什么到了舟山前线却只带给了我们一篇以民间传说的爱情故事为题材的“黑鳗”呢？为什么他不用一个革命诗人所应有的力量来歌颂我们的海防的英雄们呢？我们大家是多么盼望他和其他的老诗人们都写出好诗来呵！
    我们的作家只有和人民，特别是斗争中的人们保持密切的联系，和人民共利害，共呼吸，才能有人民的情感。忠诚地无条件地为人民服务的思想和献身于社会主义共产主义伟大事业的热情，就是推动我们的作家写出优秀作品的真正动力。让热情的火花在我们作家的心灵中永远不熄地放射吧！
    这次会议以后，我相信将会有大批大批的作家到工厂、矿
  山、工地去，到农村中去，到边疆，到国防前线去，到社会主义建设和社会主义改造正在火热地进行的各个战线上去。我们的会应当成为一个动员作家到人民生活中去的大会。广大文学青年和各个工作岗位上不少爱好文学并且具有文学修养的干部，他们被自己经历的生活所感动，有写作的冲动和欲望。我们的会应当成为广泛吸引一切新生力量到文学队伍中来的大会。
