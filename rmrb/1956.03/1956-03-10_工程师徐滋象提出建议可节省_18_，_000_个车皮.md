Engineer Xu Zixiang's Proposal
Can Save 18,000 Railcars

    The proposal to relax the loading gauge for light and buoyant goods, put forward by Xu Zixiang, an economic engineer and advanced worker at the Shanghai Railway Administration, has been adopted and formally implemented on all lines of the administration starting from the 8th. Regulations stipulate height and width limits for loading light and buoyant goods on open railway cars. In early February this year, Xu Zixiang measured the height and width of bridges and tunnels on the lines under the Shanghai Railway Administration. He believed that as long as the cargo supports were sturdy and the bundling was firm, the loading gauge could be increased by 0.1 meters to 0.3 meters respectively, without affecting traffic safety. His suggestion received the attention of the Ministry of Railways and the Shanghai Railway Administration. In late February, they began trial shipments of goods such as logs and bamboo at Yiyang, Shangrao, Quzhou, and Longyou stations on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, with good results. The average payload of the vehicles increased by 18.8%. According to preliminary calculations, the implementation of this proposal across the entire administration can save more than 18,000 railcars a year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    工程师徐滋象提出建议
    可节省18，000个车皮
    上海铁路管理局经济工程师、先进工作者徐滋象提出的放宽轻浮货物装载限界的建议，已经被采纳，8日起在这个管理局的各线铁路上正式实行。铁路敞车装载轻浮货物规定有高度和宽度的限界。今年2月初，徐滋象测算了上海铁路管理局所属各线桥梁、山洞的高、宽度以后，认为只要货物支柱坚实，捆扎牢固，装载限界可以分别提高0.1公尺到0.3公尺，并不影响行车安全。他的建议得到铁道部和上海铁路管理局的重视，2月下旬就开始在浙赣铁路的弋阳、上饶、衢县、龙游等车站试验装运原木、毛竹等货物，效果很好，车辆的载重量平均提高了18.8％。据初步计算，由于这一建议在全局实行，一年可以节省18，000多个车皮。（新华社）
