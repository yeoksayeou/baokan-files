    Dulles' Bushido
    Many American newspapers are paying close attention to the enormous impact of the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party. The grand scale of the Sixth Five-Year Plan and the broad achievements of the Soviet Union in strengthening international cooperation have forced American newspapers to helplessly admit: "We underestimated Russia," and we "lost the initiative." The policy of organizing military blocs and intensifying the "Cold War" has been met with increasing criticism at home and abroad; American newspapers believe that "the United States is currently facing a dilemma" and demand "a thorough study of the entire purpose and means of American foreign policy."

    Thus, Dulles has had to appear again in a Bushido-like posture.

    In a speech on February 26, Dulles seemed to want to use his Bushido sword to cut away the well-founded and widespread panic in American bourgeois public opinion. He wanted to give these people a tranquilizer. He claimed that the many military blocs that the United States had created and the United States' "powerful deterrent" had already "frustrated" the Soviet Union and frightened it.

    Who believes him?

    New York Times reporter Reston replied: "Nobody here really believes that. The surprising and gratifying fact is that even Mr. Dulles doesn't believe it."

    It is correct to say that Dulles does not believe that he has frightened anyone. Not long ago, Dulles was vehemently criticized and had nowhere to escape because of his "brink of war" scaremongering, including within the United States. It is clear that it is not the Soviet Union's peaceful policies that have been frustrated, but precisely the United States' "policy of strength" and the proponents of this policy. Just five days before Dulles gave his speech, Lippmann wrote: "In the past 6 months, we have suffered the greatest and most serious frustration since the communists won in China." However, although Dulles is constantly running into obstacles, although he knows that he cannot frighten anyone, he still believes in his Bushido, believes in his "brink of war" policy.

    Like a fossil, Dulles remains clamoring for the outdated and bankrupt "policy of strength" in the face of lively and great real-world developments. He announced that he would not consider abandoning the United States' military policy of establishing bases everywhere on other countries' territories. In particular, whenever he promotes the "policy of strength," he never forgets to make futile threats to the Chinese people and the Asian people. In his speech on February 26, he again emphasized the illegal U.S.-Chiang war treaty and clamored that if "necessary," the United States would use armed forces in the Taiwan area. Dulles' blind faith in force has reached such a degree. It is clear that Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia announced at a press conference in Beijing: "They (the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization) told us that they would automatically protect us, and we rejected this protection because this protection is not honorable." However, Dulles pretends not to know about this solemn statement and insists on linking Cambodia to this treaty in an attempt to put pressure on independent countries. Dulles' speech, as well as the recent military provocations by the United States in Bangkok and Ryukyu Islands, show that the American aggressive bloc is not only unwilling to abandon the threat of force against the Chinese people and the Asian people, but also wants to continue this threat and continue to intensify the tense situation in the Far East and Asia.

    From the February 26 speech, people see that Dulles does not think at all that the affairs of any country in Asia, such as their respective systems, can only be decided by these countries themselves. He insists that "backward countries," that is, Asian countries, "strengthen" the so-called "free institutions" of the United States, believing that only in this way can the interests of the United States be "fully satisfied." What are the so-called "free institutions" of the United States? They are these things: The United States can arbitrarily seize other countries' territories to make its military bases; American troops can freely demonstrate and parade in other countries' capitals; American monopoly capital can freely plunder other countries' resources, squeeze out other countries' national capital, and turn other countries into its commodity markets and sources of huge profits under the protection of so-called American "aid." Dulles wants Asian countries to "strengthen" this kind of "free institutions" that the United States wants, so that the United States can freely enslave the Asian people. If this is done, it will probably satisfy the interests of the United States, but the Asian countries and peoples who are determined to strive for and maintain independence will never think that their own systems can be dictated by the United States Secretary of State Dulles, no matter what Dulles thinks this has to do with the interests of the United States (correctly speaking, the interests of the American aggressive bloc).

    When the "policy of strength" has suffered a shameful failure, when the balance of world political forces is becoming more and more unfavorable to the aggressors, Dulles' Bushido posture and his boasted "policy of strength" appear particularly rigid and particularly foul. It is worth noting the recent remarks of US Air Force Secretary Quarles. While waving nuclear weapons to threaten the people of all countries, Quarles could not help but admit: The United States cannot "achieve victory in the traditional sense of a world war." The likes of Dulles should soberly assess the current international situation, from which it is not difficult to draw some useful conclusions.

### 杜勒斯的武士道

专栏：观察家评论

    杜勒斯的武士道
    美国不少报刊十分注意苏共第二十次代表大会的巨大影响。第六个五年计划的伟大规模，苏联为加强国际合作所作的广泛成就，使得美国报刊无可奈何地承认：“我们低估了俄国”，我们“丧失了主动权”。组织军事集团和加剧“冷战”的方针在美国国内国外受到了越来越多的抨击；美国报刊认为“美国目前面临进退维谷的处境”，要求“彻底研究美国外交政策的整个目的和手段”。
    这样，杜勒斯就不得不又来以武士道的姿态出现了。
    杜勒斯在2月26日发表演说，俨然想用他的武士道的宝剑把美国资产阶级舆论界有根据的普遍惊慌一剑砍掉。他想给这些人一贴定心丸。据说，美国所搞的许多军事集团和美国的“强大的威慑力量”，已经“挫折”了苏联，把苏联吓倒了。
    谁相信他呢？
    纽约时报记者赖斯顿回答说：“这里谁也不当真相信这一套。令人吃惊而又快慰的事实是，就是杜勒斯先生也不相信。”
    说杜勒斯不相信他已经吓倒了人是对的。在不久以前，杜勒斯就因为发表“战争边缘”的恐吓论调而遭到各国舆论——包括美国的在内——的猛烈抨击，逃无可逃。可见，被锉折的并不是苏联的和平政策，恰恰是美国的“实力政策”和这种政策的鼓吹者。就在杜勒斯发表演说的前五天，李普曼还写道：“在过去的6个月中，我们遭受了自从共产党在中国取得胜利以来的最大的也是最严重的锉折。”但是，虽然杜勒斯到处碰钉子，虽然他知道吓不倒人，他却还是相信自己的武士道，相信自己的“战争边缘”政策。
    杜勒斯在生动而伟大的现实发展面前像化了石的人一样，仍然叫嚣着陈腐不堪、已经破产了的“实力政策”。他宣布不考虑放弃美国在别国的领土上到处建立基地的军事政策。特别是，每当他鼓吹“实力政策”的时候，他总不忘记向中国人民和亚洲人民进行毫无作用的恫吓。在2月26日的演说中，他又强调非法的美蒋战争条约，并且叫嚷如有“必要的话”，美国将在台湾地区使用武装部队。杜勒斯迷信武力竟到了如此地步。明明柬埔寨西哈努克亲王在北京记者招待会宣布：“它们（东南亚条约组织）对我们说它们将自动地保护我们，我们拒绝了这种保护，因为这种保护是不光荣的。”可是，杜勒斯却装着不知道这个庄严声明，硬要把柬埔寨同这个条约拉在一起，企图对独立国家施加压力。杜勒斯的演说，以及不久以前美国在曼谷和琉璜岛举行的军事挑衅说明，美国侵略集团不但不愿意放弃对中国人民和亚洲人民的武力威胁，并且要继续进行这种威胁，继续加剧远东和亚洲地区的紧张局势。
    从2月26日的演说中，人们看到杜勒斯一点也不认为亚洲任何一个国家的事务，譬如说它们各自的制度，只能由这些国家自己来决定。他硬要“落后国家”，也就是亚洲国家，“加强”美国的所谓“自由制度”，认为只有这样，美国的利益才能“得到充分的满足”。美国的所谓“自由制度”是什么呢？它就是这些东西：美国可以随意霸占别国的领土做它的军事基地；美国的军队可以在别国的首都自由示威游行；美国垄断资本可以借着所谓美“援”的保护，自由掠夺别国的资源，排挤别国的民族资本，把别国变成它的商品市场和巨额利润的来源。杜勒斯就是要亚洲国家“加强”美国所要的这种“自由制度”，以便美国自由地奴役亚洲人民。如果这样做，大概是会使美国的利益得到满足的，但是，坚决争取和维护独立的亚洲国家和人民，却决不认为自己的制度是可以由美国国务卿杜勒斯有资格来吩咐的事情，不管杜勒斯以为这同美国的利益（正确地说是美国侵略集团的利益）有什么关系。
    当“实力政策”已经遭到可耻的失败，当世界政治力量的对比对侵略者愈来愈不利的时候，杜勒斯的武士道姿态和他所吹嘘的“实力政策”显得特别僵化，特别发臭。值得注意的是美国空军部长卡利斯在最近的一次谈话。卡利斯在挥舞着核子武器向各国人民进行恫吓的时候，却也不能不承认：美国不“能取得世界战争的传统意义上的胜利”。杜勒斯之流应该清醒地估计一下目前的国际局势，那是不难从中得出一些有益的结论的。
