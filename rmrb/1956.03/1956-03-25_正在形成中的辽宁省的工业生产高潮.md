Industrial Production Upsurge Forming in Liaoning Province

By our reporter Gu Lei

Driven by the high tide of the socialist revolution, and under the call of the Party Central Committee to develop industrial production in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way, an industrial production upsurge is taking shape in Liaoning.

The industrial production upsurge forming in Liaoning Province, compared with previous production movements, demonstrates greater socialist consciousness and a spirit of bold technological reform.

The number of rationalization proposals from many enterprises has suddenly increased, and the proposers are extremely widespread. Many employees not only make proposals but also begin to implement them. The employees of the Shenyang Smelter put forward 119 major rationalization proposals, 106 of which were implemented by themselves, and most of these proposals can solve various key problems in production.

Employees conscientiously discuss the national plan, actively study subjective and objective conditions, and try to increase production; at the same time, they formulate personal guarantees for completing the plan. In many enterprises, the plans of the ministries and bureaus are surpassed by the factory plans, the factory plans are surpassed by the workshop plans, and the workshop plans are surpassed by the workers. Some employees even actively ask enterprise leaders for more tasks. The employees of the Fourth Workshop of the Shenyang Water Pump Factory, when discussing the quotas, felt that the 382,326 hours assigned to them were too few and requested an additional 100,000 hours.

Learning from advanced experiences has become a craze. Employees factor in learning from advanced experiences when formulating their guarantees. The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's plan to increase steel production by 222,000 tons this year is based on learning and promoting more than 20 new steelmaking technologies and experiences. There are also many instances of mutual learning of advanced experiences. Li Baoshu, the nationally renowned fast tunneling team leader of the Fuxin Ping'an Coal Mine, and other miners went to the Fushun Laohutai Coal Mine to learn about the four-shift operation experience. In many enterprises, experiences that were discarded in the past are now being re-summarized and promoted. Now, employees universally demand more time for cultural and technical learning in order to quickly master new technologies.

Many employees boldly carry out technological reforms, breaking through outdated technical regulations and standards. Ding Yishan, an old miner from Laohutai in Fushun, changed the old-fashioned "supporting shed" to a "connected supporting shed," breaking the method of setting up sheds that had been used for forty years, fundamentally ensuring the safety of workers and saving one-third of the pit timber. Liu Deshun, the leader of the youth welding team of the Petroleum No. 1 Factory, and the young workers in the team, used scrap materials such as old iron wire to make their own welding rods, which are of the same quality as imported welding rods, costing only four cents per kilogram, while imported welding rods cost two to four yuan. This team has now proposed not to receive welding rods from the state for seven years. Many similar technical innovations have broken some old and unreasonable technical regulations and combated technical conservatism and the bad habit of blindly worshiping old technologies.

Many technicians take the initiative to study and improve technology and help workers realize rationalization proposals. Tan Xuerong, the deputy chief engineer of the Fushun Mining Bureau, immediately went to the site to help the workers summarize the experience when Pang Guanxiang and Zhou Guangrui of Laohutai Mine created new coal mining methods, and affirmed this experience in theory, reducing obstacles in the promotion process. The technicians and staff of the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory organized 19 working groups, which went to the workshops to help workers formulate measures to complete the plan ahead of schedule.

In the past, workshops, groups, and individuals that were relatively backward in production also strived to emulate advanced producers. The broad masses of employees not only demand to improve production but also demand political progress. Many people have proposed to strive for joining the Party and the League in the process of completing the first five-year plan ahead of schedule! On this ideological basis, the advanced producer movement aimed at completing the first five-year plan ahead of schedule has already unfolded among the broad masses of employees!

If the enthusiasm of the broad masses of employees for building socialism were only scattered in every corner, it would naturally be impossible to set off a high tide of industrial production. This requires strengthening leadership. To this end, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a symposium of industrial ministers of various municipal Party committees, and also issued instructions to the Party organizations of enterprises, requiring Party organizations of various enterprises to strengthen the leadership of employees' labor competitions. At that time, the leading personnel in many enterprises had serious conservative ideas: a few people closed their doors to make plans, and delayed in submitting them to the masses for discussion; they did not deal with workers' rationalization proposals in a timely manner, did not actively identify and promote advanced experiences, and did not reward advanced producers in a timely manner; they had not yet taken the most effective measures to guide the masses to solve the key problems in production, fearing to disrupt the existing production balance of enterprises; they were fascinated by outdated regulations and systems, and did not actively modify some that could be broken, fearing difficulties. In short, some enterprise leaders underestimated the enthusiasm and wisdom of employees and did not see the huge material power hidden behind this enthusiasm. The Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China criticized this conservative thinking and practice, and called on enterprise leaders to actively lead the masses.

The leading personnel of various enterprises, according to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, began to change their leadership style and strengthened the leadership of employees' socialist competitions through many specific methods.

Some enterprises quickly mobilized technicians and staff to go to the workshops to help workers review and implement rationalization proposals, and promptly praised the advanced. The past method of reviewing rationalization proposals was "reporting at each level, and reviewing at each level," coupled with many concerns and striving for perfection, which often resulted in delays. Now, the method of "reviewing on the spot and approving implementation on the spot" is adopted. As long as the proposal does not affect product performance, does not change the process regulations, is technically certain, and has a scientific basis, the workshop can approve its implementation. At the same time, the enterprise leadership also put forward topics based on production needs and combined with existing problems, so that employees can solve them. Many problems that could not be solved in production in the past have been solved smoothly in this way. In order to encourage the advanced and continuously expand the ranks of the advanced, many enterprises have promptly rewarded advanced individuals and units. Some enterprises also sent the bonuses and prizes of advanced producers to their homes, creating an atmosphere of glory for the advanced everywhere, which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of employees.

In the past, many enterprise leaders were afraid of the enterprise's balance being broken, or they did not actively organize a new balance when the old balance was broken, so that the enterprise's production level could not be comprehensively improved for a long time. What about now? They mobilize employees to adopt measures for the new imbalance phenomenon that appears in the enterprise, organize the backward to learn from the advanced, eliminate weak links, organize a new balance, and promote the entire enterprise forward. Lu Xiaofeng, a technician, and Pan Lichang, a trainee technician, of the heating section of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's medium-sized rolling mill, put forward a proposal to increase the capacity of the heating furnace by 30%. Under the urging of the masses' enthusiasm, the leading staff of the medium-sized rolling mill went to mobilize the employees of the rolling, shearing, and straightening sections to learn from the heating section. As a result of the employees' discussions, a new balance of production was achieved. The Anshan Iron and Steel Company originally wanted this factory's production level to increase by 41.6% compared with last year, but it actually increased by 54%.

Some enterprises, according to the requirements of the broad masses of employees to learn from advanced experiences, systematically promoted advanced experiences, changing the previous erroneous attitudes of turning a blind eye to advanced experiences, not promoting them systematically, and not humbly learning from the experiences of fraternal units. The leading staff of the Fushun Longfeng Mine this time combined the coal mining experience in five aspects and called on employees to boldly improve coal mining methods based on these experiences and the conditions of their own coal mines, so that the leadership's intentions and the requirements of the employees were quickly combined. After learning from advanced experiences, employees improved four coal mining methods, increasing efficiency by an average of two times; the actual cost of each ton of coal was reduced from 10.8 yuan last year to 7.78 yuan; the entire mine can extract 3,481 people to support other units on the condition of guaranteeing the completion of the five-year plan ahead of schedule, and the number of extracted people accounts for more than 30% of the total number of employees; the safety of coal mining has also been guaranteed.

Some enterprises guided the enthusiasm of employees to thoroughly reform the enterprise's production organization and technological transformation, eliminating the phenomenon of the leadership's intentions being divorced from the masses' enthusiasm in the past. The Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory systematically implemented production organization reform, organized new assembly lines, mobilized workers to eliminate weak links in the reorganization process, and comprehensively improved the production level. The original design capacity of this factory was 20,000 pneumatic tools per year, and it will exceed 45,000 units after the reorganization is completed.

On the basis of the above-mentioned huge reforms in all aspects, most of the enterprises in the province have put forward guarantees for completing the five-year plan ahead of schedule. As of the end of February, nearly 300 state-owned enterprises in Shenyang City are expected to complete the first five-year plan one year or more ahead of schedule, and five factories have now reached the 1957 production level.

There are also some problems in the industrial production upsurge forming in Liaoning Province. Many enterprises have not yet determined their plans, and some enterprises still have not systematically promoted advanced experiences. Most rationalization proposals have not yet become a reality, and some regulations and systems that should be revised have not been revised in time. The reward work is still very untimely, and some employees have not participated in the advanced producer movement. The development of work between enterprises and types of work is still very unbalanced, and there are still many shortcomings in comprehensively completing the industrial production plan. For example, in February, the completion rate of various products ranged from as high as 184% to as low as 39.3%. Twelve of the forty major products of state-owned enterprises in Liaoning Province did not complete the monthly plan. Some enterprises have also begun to neglect quality, economy, and safety in order to achieve more and faster production. Without overcoming the above-mentioned shortcomings, it will not only be difficult to ensure the comprehensive implementation of the "more, faster, better, and more economical" policy, but also the enthusiasm of employees will be difficult to sustain.

The Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened its Sixth Plenary Session at the end of February, pointing out that further strengthening the leadership of the industrial production upsurge is the most important task of the Liaoning Party organization. The main tasks of strengthening leadership are: to continue to strengthen socialist education for employees, to deeply mobilize the masses to carry out the struggle against conservative ideas, to effectively guide the enthusiasm of the masses to solve the main problems in production, and to organize a new production balance in enterprises, and comprehensively improve the production level of enterprises; to vigorously support advanced figures, actively organize learning and promote advanced experiences, and quickly help workers realize rationalization proposals; to comprehensively launch labor competitions, carry out the advanced producer movement, and expand the ranks of advanced producers; to improve employees' cultural and technical learning, and to systematically improve employees' cultural and technical level; to effectively improve employees' welfare life, and to care about their political life. Outstanding individuals who complete the five-year plan ahead of schedule should be promptly admitted to the Party and the League.

However, only doing the above-mentioned work cannot completely guarantee the continuous upsurge of industrial production, because there are many problems that need to be solved by various industrial ministries and bureaus.

It is necessary to quickly determine the increased production targets and the balance of various products. The plans proposed by the broad masses of employees have already broken through the original national balance, and the competent departments need to reorganize a new balance. Therefore, the various industrial competent departments should quickly organize a new balance, determine the planned targets for various products, and arrange the key tasks of the enterprises as soon as possible. Clearly propose which enterprises can greatly increase production on the basis of quality and economy, and which enterprises should focus on increasing varieties and improving quality, so as to facilitate the organization of the masses to systematically improve the production level and technical level of enterprises.

Due to the fact that the quantity of products in various enterprises has increased many times over, the current supply of raw materials, tools, and equipment in various enterprises is quite tight. Many enterprises in Shenyang City have experienced work stoppages due to waiting for materials, especially machinery factories. Although this problem can be partially solved through exchanges, swaps, or the use of stagnant materials between enterprises, it cannot be completely solved. It needs to be solved by the industrial competent departments.

Because all types of enterprises must complete the five-year plan ahead of schedule and increase production, it will inevitably, and has already happened, that enterprises that undertake collaborative products are required to deliver more and faster. To solve this problem, on the one hand, it depends on the active collaboration between enterprises to overcome difficulties and meet each other's needs; on the other hand, it also depends on the industrial competent departments to organize collaboration in this area.

These problems are the urgent demands put forward by the industrial production upsurge that is taking shape to the various industrial departments, and need to be solved by the industrial competent departments as a whole. In fact, only by solving these problems can the enthusiasm of millions of employees be transformed into a huge material force.

    正在形成中的辽宁省的工业生产高潮
    本报记者　顾雷
    在社会主义革命高潮推动下，在党中央提出又多又快又好又省地发展工业生产的要求下，辽宁的工业生产高潮正在形成中。
    辽宁省正在形成中的工业生产高潮，和过去的历次生产运动比较，更带有社会主义的自觉性和大胆改革技术的精神。
    许多企业的合理化建议突然增加，提建议的人极为普遍。不少的职工一面提建议，一面着手实现建议。沈阳冶炼厂职工提出了的119条重大的合理化建议，由自己动手实现的有106条，而且这些建议大都能解决生产中的各种关键问题。
    职工们都认真讨论国家计划，积极研究主客观条件，设法提高生产；同时制定个人保证完成计划的条件。在许多企业中都是这样：部、局计划被厂计划突破，厂计划被车间突破，车间计划被工人突破。有的职工还主动地向企业领导人员要任务。沈阳水泵厂四车间职工，讨论定额的时候，觉得给他们的382，326小时任务太少，要求再增加十万小时。
    学习先进经验已经形成热潮。职工们在制定保证条件的时候，都计算上学习先进经验的因素。鞍山钢铁公司提出今年增产二十二万二千吨钢的计划，就是建立在学习和推广二十多项炼钢新技术、新经验的基础上的。相互学习先进经验的事也很多。阜新平安煤矿快速掘进队长、全国著名的快速掘进手李宝书和其他矿的掘进手，到抚顺老虎台煤矿学习四班作业的经验。在不少的企业中，过去丢掉的经验，现在又重新总结、推广了。现在，职工们普遍要求增加文化和技术学习时间，以便迅速掌握新的技术。
    许多职工大胆地进行技术改革，突破了陈旧的技术规程和标准。抚顺老虎台老矿工丁义山，把旧式的“擎口棚子”改为“连接式擎口棚子”，打破了四十年来一直运用的架棚子的方法，根本保证了工人的安全，并且节省三分之一的坑木。石油一厂青年电焊小组长刘德顺和小组青年工人一起，利用旧铁丝等废料自制一种焊条，质量和进口的焊条一样，每公斤价值只四分钱，而进口的焊条却需要二至四元，这个小组现在提出七年内不向国家领焊条。许许多多类似的技术创造，打破了一些旧的不合理的技术规程，打击了技术上的保守思想和盲目崇拜旧技术的坏风气。
    许多技术人员主动地研究改进技术，帮助工人实现合理化建议。抚顺矿务局副总工程师谭学荣，当老虎台矿庞观祥、周广瑞创造新的采煤方法的时候，立即深入现场帮助工人进行总结，从理论上肯定这个经验，减少了推广过程中的障碍。大连机车车辆厂的技术人员和职员，组织了19个工作组，分头深入车间帮助工人制定提前完成计划的措施。
  　过去生产上比较落后的车间、小组和个人，也都争取向先进生产者看齐。广大职工群众不但要求提高生产，而且要求政治上进步，不少的人提出在提前完成第一个五年计划过程中争取入党入团。在这个思想基础上，以提前完成第一个五年计划为目标的先进生产者运动，已经在广大职工中展开了！
    广大职工建设社会主义的热情，如果只散落在每一个角落里，自然不可能掀起一个工业生产的高潮。这就需要加强领导。为此，中共辽宁省委员会召开了各市委工业部长座谈会，还为此向企业党的组织发出指示，要求各企业党组织，加强对职工的劳动竞赛的领导。当时，不少企业中的领导人员，严重存在着保守思想：少数人关门搞计划，迟迟不交给群众讨论；不及时处理工人的合理化建议，不积极地鉴定和推广先进经验，对已出现的先进生产者不及时进行奖励；还没有采取最有效的措施，引导群众去解决生产中的关键问题，害怕打乱企业现有的生产平衡；迷恋过时的规程制度，有些可以打破的却不积极修改，害怕困难。总之，有一部分企业领导人员对职工的热情和智慧估计不足，看不到在这种热情后面蕴藏着的巨大的物质力量。中共辽宁省委员会批评了这种保守的思想和做法，号召企业领导者积极去领导群众。
    各个企业的领导人员，根据省委的指示开始转变了领导作风，通过许多具体办法加强对职工的社会主义竞赛的领导。
    有的企业迅速动员技术人员、职员深入车间，帮助工人审查和实现合理化建议，并且及时表扬先进。过去审查合理化建议的办法是“逐级上报、层层审查”，再加上顾虑很多，求全求好，因而时常是拖延日期。现在采用“当场进行审查，就地批准实现”的办法，只要建议不影响产品性能、不改变工艺规程、技术上有把握、有科学根据的，车间就可以批准实行。同时，企业领导机构也根据生产需要，结合存在的问题，提出课题，让职工解决。许多过去生产中解决不了的问题，就这样顺利地解决了。为了鼓励先进、不断扩大先进的队伍，很多企业及时地奖励了先进的个人和单位。有的企业还把先进生产者的奖金、奖品送到他家里去。到处造成先进光荣的气氛，大大地鼓舞了职工的热情。
    过去，不少企业的领导人员害怕企业的平衡被突破，或者旧的平衡被突破了也不积极组织新的平衡，以致使企业生产水平长期不能全面地提高。现在呢？他们对于企业中出现的新的不平衡现象，发动职工采取措施组织落后的向先进的看齐，消除薄弱环节，组织新的平衡，推动整个企业前进。鞍钢中型轧钢厂加热工段技师吕晓峰和见习技术员潘立昌，提出一项建议使加热炉的能力提高30％。中型轧钢厂领导工作人员在群众热情的督促下，便去发动轧钢、剪断、矫正三个工段的职工向加热工段看齐。职工们讨论的结果，实现了生产的新的平衡。鞍山钢铁公司原要这个厂的生产水平比去年提高41.6％，实际却提高了54％。
    有的企业根据广大职工学习先进经验的要求，系统地推广先进经验，改变了过去那种对先进经验熟视无睹、推广时不系统、不虚心学习兄弟单位的经验等错误态度。抚顺龙凤矿的领导工作人员，这次曾综合了五个方面的采煤经验，号召职工根据这些经验、根据自己煤矿的情况大胆地改进采煤方法，使领导意图很快和职工群众的要求结合起来了。职工学习先进经验以后改进了四种采煤方法，平均提高效率两倍；每一吨煤的实际成本由去年的十元八角降低到七元七角八分；全矿在保证提前完成五年计划的条件下，可抽出3，481人支援其他单位，抽出的人占全体职工总数30％以上；采煤的安全问题也有了保证。
    有的企业把职工的热情引导去彻底地对企业进行生产组织的改革和技术改造，消除了过去领导意图和群众热情脱节的现象。沈阳风动工具厂有计划地实行生产组织改革，组织新的流水作业线，发动工人消除改组过程中的薄弱环节，全面提高了生产水平。这个厂原设计能力是年产风动工具二万台，完成改组后将超过四万五千台。
    在以上各方面的巨大的改革的基础上，全省绝大部分企业都提出了提前完成五年计划的保证。沈阳市截至二月底止，已经有近三百个国营企业预计可以提前一年或一年以上完成第一个五年计划，有五个工厂现在已经达到1957年生产水平。
    辽宁省正在形成中的工业生产高潮也还有一些问题。不少企业计划未确定，还有的企业仍没有系统地推广先进经验，大部分合理化建议还没有变成现实，一些应该修改的规程制度还未及时修改，奖励工作还很不及时，职工中还有一部分人没有参加先进生产者运动，企业和工种之间的工作发展还很不平衡，在全面完成工业生产计划方面也还存在不少的缺点。例如，在二月份各种产品完成产量计划的有高达184％的，有低到39.3％的。辽宁全省国营企业四十种主要产品中有十二种没有完成月计划。还有的企业，开始发生为了多和快而忽视好、省和安全的现象。不克服上述缺点，不仅难于保证全面贯彻“多、快、好、省”的方针，职工的热情也很难持久。
    中共辽宁省委员会于二月底召开了第六次全体委员会议，指出进一步加强对工业生产高潮的领导是辽宁党组织最重要的任务。加强领导的主要工作是：继续加强对职工的社会主义教育，深入发动群众进行反保守思想的斗争，切实地把群众热情引导去解决生产中的主要问题，组织企业中新的生产平衡。全面提高企业的生产水平；大力支持先进的人物，积极组织学习和推广先进经验，迅速帮助工人实现合理化建议；全面发动劳动竞赛，开展先进生产者运动，扩大先进生产者的队伍；改进职工的文化和技术学习，有计划地提高职工文化技术水平；切实改善职工的福利生活，并且关心他们的政治生活。对提前完成五年计划中的优秀分子，应该及时吸收他们入党、入团。
    但是，只做了上述的工作，还是不能完全保证工业生产的不断高涨，因为有许多问题需要各工业部、局去解决。
    需要迅速确定增产的指标和各种产品的平衡。广大职工讨论提出的计划，已经突破了国家原来的平衡，需要主管部门重新组织新的平衡。因此，各工业主管部门，应该迅速组织新的平衡，确定各种产品的计划指标，及早布置企业的工作重点。明确提出哪些企业可以在好、省的基础上大大增产，哪些企业应该着重增加品种和提高质量，以便于组织群众有计划地提高企业生产水平和技术水平。
    由于各企业产品数量成倍地增加了，目前各企业的原材料、工卡具、设备供应情况相当紧张。沈阳市有不少企业发生停工待料现象，特别是机械工厂。这个问题，各厂虽然可以通过企业之间交流、串换或利用呆滞材料解决一部分，却不能全部解决。需要工业主管部门加以解决。
    因为各种类型的企业都要提前完成五年计划，都要增产，势必、而且已经发生了这样一种情况：都要求承制协作产品的企业要交的多、交得快。要解决这个问题，一方面依赖各企业之间主动地协作，克服困难相互满足需要；另一方面，也依赖于各工业主管部门组织这方面的协作。
    这些问题，就是正在形成中的工业生产高潮向各工业部门提出的迫切的要求，需要工业主管部门通盘解决。事实上，只有解决了这些问题，才能把千百万职工的热情变成巨大的物质力量。
