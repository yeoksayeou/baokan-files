Xinhua News Agency, New York News: The New York "Daily Worker" reported in late February that the Argentine Communist Party's campaign, which began last September, to develop 15,000 new members and 6,000 Communist Youth League members has ended successfully. According to preliminary statistics, by January 6th of this year, the Argentine Communist Party had already recruited 22,204 new members and Communist Youth League members. Many new members are workers from large enterprises in the Argentine capital and important industrial cities, especially large enterprises controlled by American companies, of whom 25% to 30% are women. According to the "Daily Worker," the Argentine Communist Party has announced that in order to further expand the party's ranks, it has decided to launch another campaign to develop 100,000 new members.

The Argentine Communist Party's new membership drive was carried out under unstable domestic circumstances. The Argentine authorities have consistently persecuted the Argentine Communist Party, but neither past nor present difficulties and persecutions can prevent the growth of the Argentine Communist Party.

    阿根廷共产党胜利进行发展新党员的运动
    据新华社讯　纽约消息：纽约“工人日报”在2月下旬报道，阿根廷共产党从去年9月开始的发展15，000名新党员和6，000名共产主义青年团团员的运动已经胜利结束。根据初步统计，到今年1月6日，阿根廷共产党已经吸收了22，204名新党员和共产主义青年团团员。许多新党员都是阿根廷首都和重要工业城市的大企业、特别是由美国公司控制的大企业的工人，其中有25％到30％是妇女。据“工人日报”说，阿根廷共产党已经宣布，为了进一步扩大党的队伍，它已经决定再发动一个发展10万新党员的运动。
    阿根廷共产党这次发展新党员的运动是在国内局势不稳定的情况下进行的。阿根廷的当权者一直对阿根廷共产党进行迫害，但是过去和现在的困难和迫害都不能阻止阿根廷共产党的成长。
