Since liberation, unprecedented veterinary epidemic prevention work has been carried out throughout the country. Veterinary cadres have been trained and grassroots organizations have been established in various places. There are now more than 10,000 veterinary cadres and more than 80,000 folk veterinarians in the country.

Before liberation, rinderpest was a common occurrence and the most serious epidemic disease that harmed draught cattle. Now, with the exception of a few areas such as Qamdo, rinderpest has been basically eliminated in agricultural areas across the country and in pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia. In Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Jilin and other key horse-producing areas in China, glanders was very common before liberation. After liberation, great efforts were made to organize the masses and combine scientific and technological guidance for prevention and control. Now it has been basically eliminated. Anthrax and emphysema were prevalent in many provinces such as Henan, Anhui, Hebei, and Zhejiang before liberation. They were serious epidemic diseases of draught animals and often infected people. After years of vigorous prevention and control since liberation, the epidemic has been contained in most areas. There have been no major epidemics and the number of deaths has decreased year by year.

In recent years, certain achievements have also been made in the prevention and treatment of swine fever and swine erysipelas. For example, in the suburbs of Neijiang City, Sichuan Province, there were more than 30,000 pigs and no outbreaks occurred in 1955. In Hou Dazibu Village, Liaoyang County, Liaoning Province, swine fever has not occurred for three years. In pastoral areas such as Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, and Qinghai, there was no veterinary epidemic prevention work to speak of before liberation. In 1933, one million cattle died in the northwestern provinces due to rinderpest, which seriously affected the lives of herdsmen. After years of prevention and control since liberation, rinderpest has been brought under control. Other diseases such as anthrax in cattle and sheep, and internal and external parasites in cattle and sheep, are also being actively prevented and treated. The incidence of livestock deaths has decreased year by year. (Chen Minwei)

    牛瘟马癞基本消灭，猪羊疫情逐年减少
    解放以后，全国各地开展了前所未有的防治兽疫工作。各地都培养了兽医干部，建立了基层组织，全国现已有兽医干部一万多人，民间兽医八万多人。
    在解放前，牛瘟常常流行，是危害耕牛最严重的疫病。现在除昌都等少数地区外，在全国农业地区和内蒙古牧区已经基本上消灭了牛瘟。我国产马的重点地区黑龙江、辽宁、吉林等省，在解放前，马癞非常普遍，解放后大力组织群众，结合科学技术指导进行防治，现已基本消灭。炭疽、气肿疽，解放前在河南、安徽、河北、浙江等许多省份内流行，是耕畜的严重疫病，并且常常传染给人，解放后连年大力防治，大部地区疫情已经遏止，没有大的流行，死亡数也逐年减少。
    几年来在防治猪瘟猪丹毒方面也获得一定成绩。例如四川内江市郊有三万多口猪，1955年没有发病，辽宁省辽阳县后达子堡村三年不发生猪瘟。在新疆、内蒙古、甘肃、青海等牧业地区，解放前根本谈不上防治兽疫的工作，1933年西北各省因牛瘟死亡牛只达一百万头，严重影响牧民生活，解放后经连年防治，牛瘟已经受到控制；其他如牛、羊炭疽、牛羊内外寄生虫等，均在积极防治中。牲畜死亡情况，逐年有了减少。（陈敏韦）
