    Beijing Textile Dyeing and Knitting Industrial Company Prepares to Promote Zhao Yonghai's Improved Yarn Combining Operation Method
    The Beijing Textile Dyeing and Knitting Industrial Company is preparing to promote the improved yarn combining operation method developed by Zhao Yonghai, a progressive youth activist from industry and commerce and a technician and accountant at the Hangzhou Public-Private Joint Zhao Baotang Warp and Weft Factory, in factories where conditions are suitable.
    Zhao Yonghai's improved yarn combining operation method reduces four processes to two, increasing work efficiency and reducing costs. During the National Congress of Progressive Youth Activists in Industry and Commerce, Zhao Yonghai and others went to the Beijing Lifeng Hehe Yarn Combining Factory to conduct on-site research on this operation method. Experiments have proved that, according to this operation method, Beijing's yarn combining factories can reduce three processes to two. According to preliminary calculations, the cost per piece of yarn can be reduced by 35%. (Sun Shuyun)

    北京织染针织工业公司准备推广赵永海改进的合线操作法
    北京市织染针织工业公司准备在有条件的工厂推广工商界青年积极分子、杭州公私合营赵宝堂经纬厂技术员兼会计赵永海改进的合线操作方法。
    赵永海改进的合线操作方法，把四道工序改为两道工序，提高了工作效率，降低了成本。在全国工商界青年积极分子大会期间，赵永海等到北京利丰合合线厂对这一操作方法作了现场研究。试验证明，根据这种操作方法，北京的合线厂可以由三道工序减缩为两道工序。据初步计算，每件纱可降低成本35％。（孙淑云）
