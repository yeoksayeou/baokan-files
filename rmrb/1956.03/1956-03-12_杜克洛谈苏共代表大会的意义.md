Xinhua News Agency, according to TASS, Paris dispatch: Paris district Communist Party members gathered on the 9th to discuss the results of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    Duclos spoke at the meeting. He emphasized that the work of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was of great international significance.

    In explaining Soviet foreign policy, Duclos pointed out that the principle of peaceful coexistence between the two systems is the foundation of Soviet foreign policy. Duclos said that the French government also has a great possibility to promote peaceful coexistence between countries with different social and political systems, and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence can serve as an important foundation in this regard.

    When discussing the question of the forms of transition to socialism in various countries, Duclos clarified the relationship between the Communist Party and the Socialist Party. Duclos said: We should explain to the working people of the Socialist Party that concerted action must be taken to implement the policies expected by the state and to prepare for the subsequent victory of socialism. We should also explain to our Socialist comrades that although this victory can be achieved through concerted action and parliamentary means, it should not be assumed that this victory means exercising power in the interests of the bourgeoisie. Power should be used to replace capitalist ownership of the means of production with socialist ownership of the means of production.

    Duclos finally pointed out that the task of the French Communists is to deeply study the materials of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and to wage a tireless struggle against bourgeois ideology.

    杜克洛谈苏共代表大会的意义
    新华社据塔斯社巴黎讯　巴黎区共产党员9日集会，讨论苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的结果。
    杜克洛在会上讲话。他着重指出，苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的工作具有重大的国际意义。
    杜克洛在阐明苏联外交政策的时候指出，两个制度和平共处的原则是苏联外交政策的基础。杜克洛说，法国政府也有极大可能性来促进社会、政治制度不同的国家之间的和平共处，而和平共处五项原则可以作为这一方面的重要基础。
    杜克洛谈到各国过渡到社会主义的形式问题的时候阐明了共产党和社会党之间的关系。杜克洛说：我们应该向社会党劳动者说明，必须一致行动来实行国家所期望的政策，并且准备随后而来的社会主义胜利。我们还应该向我们的社会党同志解释，虽然可以通过一致行动和议会途径取得这种胜利，但是并不能认为这种胜利就是按照资产阶级的利益行使政权。应当利用政权来使社会主义的生产资料所有制代替资本主义的生产资料所有制。
    杜克洛最后指出，深刻研究苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的材料以及同资产阶级的思想意识进行不倦的斗争，是法国共产党人的任务。
