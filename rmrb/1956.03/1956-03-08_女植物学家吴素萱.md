    Female Botanist Wu Suxuan
    By our reporter Jian Yuan
    "Come quick! The nucleus is drilling!" In May 1954, around 9 o'clock one morning, in the laboratory of the Institute of Botany of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a female botanist exclaimed in surprise beside a microscope.
    This female botanist was conducting research on "cell individual development," starting with observations of amitosis in the vegetative bodies of bulbous plants like onions. At the same time, she discovered a large number of nuclei penetrating from one cell wall to another, even passing through adjacent cells to reach yet another. Previously, people believed that cell nuclei were each an "independent kingdom." Although many documents record observations of cell nuclei penetrating cell walls in the female reproductive organs of plants as early as 1900, and many scholars continued to observe this in the male reproductive organs of plants in the subsequent 50 years, most people considered it an "abnormal phenomenon" and did not pay attention to it. The reason was that after Mendel's theory of heredity spread, idealistic viewpoints in biology developed rapidly. People believed that a substance called "chromosome" constantly existed in the cell nucleus, and that the "chromosome" was passed from one cell to other cells through mitosis, and from one generation of an organism to all its descendants, in a process that never changed. Obviously, the phenomenon of cell nuclei penetrating cell walls greatly contradicted this idea.
    This female botanist is Wu Suxuan, a researcher at the Institute of Botany of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and a professor in the Department of Biology at Peking University. This phenomenon aroused her great interest. She continued her experiments, and the results proved that the phenomenon of cell nuclei penetrating cell walls existed not only in growing plant tissues but also in decaying tissues. Therefore, it could be concluded that the phenomenon of cell nuclei penetrating cell walls was closely related to the physiological state and function of plant tissue cells.
    Professor Wu Suxuan's ability to achieve this victory on the path of advancing towards science is decisively related to her active study of the Soviet Union. After liberation, she studied the advanced biological theories of Soviet scientists like Michurin, participated in the symposium held when Lysenko came to China, criticized idealism in biology, and more thoroughly criticized old cytology. In the autumn of 1952, she and the teachers of Peking University intensively studied professional Russian. Then, she and her comrades opened new courses, which required writing teaching materials based on Soviet textbooks. She devoted herself to this day and night, without rest on Sundays. In addition to writing teaching materials, whenever she had time, she buried herself in books and periodicals published in the Soviet Union, such as "Proceedings of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR" and "Achievements of Modern Biology," and translated them with emphasis. From 1954, she began to carry out research on cytology more systematically based on new viewpoints.
    Professor Wu Suxuan's research on the phenomenon of cell nuclei penetrating cell walls was not smooth sailing. Her "Preliminary Report on the Phenomenon of Cell Nuclei Penetrating Cell Walls," which she proposed based on experiments, was subjected to incorrect criticism from some biological scientists. Critics subjectively believed that the phenomenon of cell nuclei penetrating cell walls that she observed was caused by mechanical damage, by stimulation when tearing off the epidermis of plants, and so on. However, she firmly remembered what Chairman Mao said in his article "On Contradiction": The fundamental cause of the development of a thing is not external but internal, residing in the contradictoriness within the thing. Therefore, she judged that the phenomenon of cell nuclei penetrating cell walls indicated that huge changes and contradictions had occurred within it. She did not retreat. She was determined to further clarify her views with facts. Based on the results observed in a series of experiments over more than a year, she proved that the movement of cell nuclei penetrating cell walls is an inherent normal phenomenon in plants, which appears universally and regularly in developing plant cells.
    The general advisor of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Soviet scientist and corresponding academician Kovda, was excited when he learned about Professor Wu Suxuan's experimental situation and immediately ran to see it, believing that this discovery was very important and encouraging her to publish her experimental report quickly. Many biologists were also very interested after learning about it and considered linking it to their ongoing research. In the 2nd and 3rd issues of Volume 4 of the "Acta Botanica Sinica," edited by the Botanical Society of China in 1955, Professor Wu Suxuan's "Preliminary Report on the Phenomenon of Cell Nuclei Penetrating Cell Walls" and a report entitled "On the Phenomenon of Cell Nuclei Penetrating Cell Walls in Plants" were published respectively.
    On the eve of the "March 8th" International Women's Day, the reporter visited Professor Wu Suxuan. In her laboratory, she showed the reporter the phenomenon of cell nuclei penetrating cell walls in garlic cells. She said that following the discovery of the phenomenon of cell nuclei penetrating cell walls, in the same research materials, when the tissue grows, especially when it begins to decline, the phenomenon of nuclear renewal was discovered again. The phenomenon of nuclear renewal further overturned the idealistic view of the Mendel-Morgan doctrine that the cell nucleus is only a genetic organ and does not play a role in the nutritional life of plants; on the contrary, it shows that the cell nucleus is constantly changing, and the process of change is closely related to the life process of the entire plant organism. This phenomenon also provides a powerful factual example for the dialectical materialist view that the plant organism is a unified whole with inherent connections.
    25 years ago, when she was a senior in college, she had already decided to engage in cytology research. Later, she worked as a teaching assistant in college, studied abroad, and returned to China to work as a professor in a university, and has never left cytology. Only because cytology was particularly deeply poisoned by idealistic views, she felt as if she had been immersed in smoke all the time. At that time, she only started from personal interests when researching, without direction. The reactionary government did not provide conditions and did not care at all, so it was naturally difficult to achieve any results. After liberation, she re-recognized the importance of cytology and became truly interested in cytology. The Party and the People's Government created conditions for conducting research and also pointed out the direction of research. Especially since the call to advance towards science, she has been even more excited and has a strong affection for cytology. She said: Now I only feel that my two hands are not enough, and 24 hours a day is too short.

    女植物学家吴素萱

    “快来看！细胞核在钻！”1954年5月间，一天上午9点多钟，在中国科学院植物研究所的实验室里，一位女植物学家在显微镜旁惊异地喊起来。
    这位女植物学家在作以“细胞个体发育”为题的研究，开始从洋葱等鳞茎植物的营养体中观察细胞的无丝分裂现象，同时发现了大量的细胞核从一个细胞穿壁到另一个细胞，甚至经过相邻的细胞，再到另一个细胞的现象。以往人们认为，细胞核是各自成为“独立王国”的。虽然不少文献记载，早在1900年，就有人在植物的雌性生殖体中观察到细胞核穿壁的现象，这以后50多年的期间，许多学者也不断地从植物的雄性生殖体中观察到，但是人们大多认为那是“不正常的现象”，不加以重视。原因是，孟德尔的遗传学说传布以后，生物学中的唯心观点迅速发展起来。人们认为，细胞核中经常有一种叫“染色体”的物质存在，而且“染色体”从一个细胞经过有丝分裂传递到其他细胞，从有机体的一代传递到它的所有后代，这样的过程永远不变。显然，细胞核的穿壁运动现象和这种说法有很大抵触。
    这位女植物学家叫吴素萱，她是中国科学院植物研究所研究员兼北京大学生物系教授。这一现象引起了她的极大兴趣。她继续作了实验，结果证明不但在植物生长着的组织中有细胞核的穿壁现象，在衰亡着的组织中也有同样的现象。因而可以断定，细胞核穿壁现象同植物组织细胞的生理状态以及它的机能有着密切的联系。
    吴素萱教授能在向科学进军的途程中取得这个胜利，和她的积极学习苏联有着决定性的关系。解放以后，她就学习了苏联米丘林等的先进生物学说，参加了格鲁森科来中国时召开的座谈会，批判了生物学中的唯心主义，更彻底批判了旧的细胞学。1952年秋季，她和北京大学的教师们一起突击学习专业俄文。接着她和同志们一起开了新的课程，需要根据苏联教本编写讲义，她就不计日夜地全力以赴，星期日也不休息。除了编写讲义，一有时间，她就埋头看苏联出版的“苏联科学院院报”、“近代生物学的成就”等书刊，并重点地翻译出来。从1954年开始，她根据新的观点，更有系统地开展了关于细胞学的研究工作。
    吴素萱教授在研究细胞核的穿壁现象的过程中，不是一帆风顺的。她根据实验提出的“细胞核穿壁运动现象的初步报告”，曾遭受到一部分生物科学工作者的不正确的批评，批评者主观地认为她所观察到的细胞核的穿壁运动现象是机械损伤所引起的，是撕取植物表皮时的刺激所引起的，等等。但是她牢牢记得毛主席在“矛盾论”一文中说的：事物发展的根本原因，不是在事物的外部而是在事物的内部，在于事物内部的矛盾性。她因而判断，细胞核的穿壁运动现象表明它的内部发生了巨大变化，发生了矛盾。她没有退缩，她决心进一步用事实来明确自己的看法。她根据一年多从一系列实验中观察的结果证明，细胞核的穿壁运动是植物体中固有的正常现象，是普遍而有规律地出现于正在发展着的植物细胞中的现象。
    中国科学院总顾问、苏联科学家柯夫达通讯院士知道了吴素萱教授的实验情况，立即兴奋地跑去看，认为这一发现很重要，鼓励她赶快发表自己的实验报告。许多生物学家知道以后，也感到很大兴趣，并考虑联系他们所进行的研究。1955年中国植物学会编辑的“植物学报”第4卷第2期和第3期上，分别刊载了吴素萱教授的“细胞核穿壁运动现象的初步报告”和以“关于植物细胞核穿壁运动现象的问题”为题的报告。
    “三八”国际妇女节前夕，记者去访问吴素萱教授。在她的实验室里，她让记者看了大蒜细胞核的穿壁现象。她说，继细胞核穿壁现象的发现，在同样的研究材料中，当组织成长以后，特别是开始衰退的时候，又发现了细胞核的更新现象。细胞核的更新现象，更进一步推翻了孟德尔—摩尔根主义所谓的细胞核只是一遗传器官而对于植物的营养生活不起作用的唯心观点；相反地说明了细胞核经常在变化着，变化过程和植物整个有机体的生活过程有着密切的联系，这一现象并且给予植物有机体是有内在联系的统一整体的辩证唯物主义的观点以有力的事实例证。
    25年前她在大学四年级读书的时候，就已经决心从事细胞学的研究，后来在大学里做助教、到国外留学，又回到国内大学做教授，都一直没有脱离过细胞学。只因为细胞学受唯心观点毒害特别深，使她感到一直仿佛沉浸在烟雾里。要研究什么，那时只从个人兴趣出发，没有方向，反动政府不给条件，也根本不管，自然很难有什么成果。解放以后她重新认识了细胞学的重要性，对细胞学真正发生了兴趣。党和人民政府给创造了进行研究工作的条件，也给指出了研究方向，特别从号召向科学进军以来，她更是欢欣鼓舞，对细胞学有了强烈的感情。她说：现在只感到自己的两只手不够用，一天24小时太短。
