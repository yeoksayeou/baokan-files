    Dalian Chemical Plant Successfully Trial-Produces High-Pressure Nitrogen Compressor
    China's first 2,400-horsepower high-pressure nitrogen compressor has recently been successfully trial-produced at the Dalian Chemical Plant and has already been put into production.
    This machine was designed by Chemical Industry Design Institute engineers Wei Lifan, technicians Yu Zuwu, Wang Shaoting, Wang Zhongyi, Liu Zerun and others, who overcame difficulties such as a lack of technical data and calculation data. During the trial production process, they also collaborated with mechanical engineer Weng Shengguang to solve many major technical problems.
    The nitrogen compressor is an indispensable machine for producing nitrogen fertilizer, which is a chemical fertilizer. It compresses nitrogen separated from the air and then sends the nitrogen, along with treated hydrogen, to a mixed compressor, which then produces synthetic ammonia, the raw material for chemical fertilizer. This large chemical machine is composed of more than 9,500 parts, including the body, spindle, and cylinder.

    大连化学厂试制高压氮气压缩机成功
    我国第一台两千四百匹马力的高压氮气压缩机，最近在大连化学厂试制成功，并且已经投入生产。
    这个机器，是由化学工业设计院工程师魏立藩，技术员郁祖梧、王绍亭、王忠义、刘泽润等五个人，在没有技术资料和计算数据的困难情况下设计成功的。在试制过程中，他们又同机械工程师翁盛光合作解决了许多重大的技术问题。
    氮气压缩机是生产化学肥料中的氮肥不可缺少的机器，它把空气中分离出的氮气进行压缩，再把氮气同经过处理的氢气一起送入混合压缩机，然后就制成化学肥料的原料合成氨。这个大型的化学机器是由机身、主轴、气缸等九千五百多个零件组成的。
