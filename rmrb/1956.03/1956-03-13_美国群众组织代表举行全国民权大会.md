Xinhua News Agency, Washington: According to reports from American news agencies, under the auspices of the "National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)," more than 2,000 representatives from dozens of American Black organizations, religious organizations, labor organizations, educational organizations, and professional organizations held a National Civil Rights Conference in Washington from the 4th to the 6th.

The central issue discussed at the conference was how to further promote the increasingly vigorous movement against discrimination against Black people and to fight for civil rights. NAACP President Wilkins pointed out at the meeting that although the American people have suffered some failures in practice in the past, or may suffer some failures in the future, the American people's ideals of freedom and equality will be realized. The conference put forward an eight-point program to strive for the realization of civil rights, especially the rights of Black people, including the abolition of racial segregation, the prohibition of lynching, equal employment opportunities for Black and White people, and the protection of the electoral rights of Black people, etc.
