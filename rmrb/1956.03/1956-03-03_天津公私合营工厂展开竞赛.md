    Tianjin Joint State-Private Factories Launch Competition
    Over 900 joint state-private factories in Tianjin have successively launched inter-factory competitions within the same industry. More than 30,000 workers are participating in these competitions. These factories belong to 10 industries, including steel, printing and dyeing, rubber, papermaking, and oil chemistry.
    In the competition, workers in many factories tapped production potential, continuously exceeded quotas, and improved the output and quality of their products. The Zhenhua Paper Mill used to frequently fail to meet the quota of 3.5 tons of corrugated paper per day. After the competition began, the daily output in February reached 6.2 tons. The shearing team of the Synthetic Rubber Factory created a new record of producing 4,200 pairs of rubber shoes per day, with a 100% qualification rate. In the competition, food industry workers also cooperated with each other, changing the situation of technological conservatism during the private ownership period.

    天津公私合营工厂展开竞赛
    天津市900多个公私合营工厂，已经先后开展同产业的厂际竞赛。参加竞赛的职工有3万多人。这些工厂分别属于钢铁、印染、橡胶、造纸、油脂化学等10个行业。
    许多工厂的职工在竞赛中，挖掘生产潜力，不断突破定额，提高了产品的产量和质量。振华造纸厂过去经常达不到日产瓦楞纸3.5吨的定额，开展竞赛后，2月份的日产量达到了6.2吨。合成橡胶厂的剪口小组，创造了日产胶鞋4，200双的新纪录，合格品达到100％。食品业的职工在竞赛中还互相协作，改变了私营时期技术保守的情况。（据新华社讯）
