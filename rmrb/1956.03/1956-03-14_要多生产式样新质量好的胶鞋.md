　　To Produce More New Styles and High-Quality Rubber Shoes
　　By Our Correspondent Chen Ji
　　The Changchun State-owned No. 8 Rubber Factory has always produced rubber shoes. However, how to produce high-quality, low-cost rubber shoes has always been the central problem for the entire factory.

　　In recent years, although all the factory workers have worked hard to improve the quality and reduce the cost of rubber shoes, they still cannot meet the demands of the people. Some factory workers say: The No. 8 Factory’s rubber shoes have few styles and are not attractive. Agricultural producers' cooperative members suggest: The pointed toes of sneakers are not good, and water often gets in when wearing them. Can rubber shoes be made like leather shoes? Many athletes report: The soles of the No. 8 Factory’s sneakers are easily broken; we need sneakers with sturdy soles. Young women hope that the uppers are thinner and the fabric patterns are more diverse. Office workers also feel that a pair of sneakers costs six or seven yuan and only lasts for three months before breaking, so it is better to buy a pair of leather shoes. In Changchun, all the stores are filled with monotonous, drab sneakers. Because rubber shoes have few styles and are of low quality, some people who used to wear rubber shoes have switched to leather shoes. Rubber shoes are often overstocked. Currently, the No. 8 Rubber Factory's warehouse still has an overstock of more than 700,000 pairs of old-style sneakers.

　　The most pressing issue facing all the workers of the No. 8 Rubber Factory is to quickly produce new styles of good rubber shoes. Last year, in order to improve the quality and increase the variety of rubber shoes, the No. 8 Rubber Factory mobilized the masses to do a lot of work. Engineering and technical personnel visited rural areas, solicited opinions, and began designing more than a dozen new styles of rubber shoes suitable for the needs of the people. This is certainly correct.

　　However, in January and February of this year, the No. 8 Rubber Factory faced a problem when formulating an overall plan: should it massively increase production or strive to improve quality? The factory leaders felt: "Other factories are rushing to complete the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule, and we must also massively increase production." They did not sufficiently study how to improve quality and increase variety, which were the most urgent issues, but instead proposed to produce more than 8 million pairs of rubber shoes this year, doubling the original plan. The commercial department, upon hearing that the No. 8 Rubber Factory was going to produce so many rubber shoes, was not willing to accept them, believing that the existing rubber shoes could not be sold, and if the production of low-quality rubber shoes was further increased, it would lead to more overstocking. The Ministry of Light Industry also disagreed with this plan, pointing out that production should not be blindly increased, but rather increased on the basis of improving quality. The No. 8 Rubber Factory had to change its plan again, spending more than a month and revising it seven times before finally deciding to produce only more than 3.7 million pairs of sneakers this year, of which more than 1.2 million pairs would be new styles of rubber shoes.

　　Although the plan has now been made, the leadership work is still one step behind. Encouraged by the high tide of socialist transformation, the workers have been actively promoting advanced experiences and putting forward rationalization proposals. However, the leaders have not promptly guided the masses to work hard to improve the quality of rubber shoes. In two or three months, the workers put forward more than 1,200 rationalization proposals, of which more than 400 were about improving quality. How were these rationalization proposals handled? Because the leading staff were busy with planning in their offices some time ago, they did not have time to personally attend to them. Many rationalization proposals were passed around between departments and rarely used in production. Rationalization proposals that needed to be appraised by the higher authorities had to go through six or seven procedures before they could be implemented. Because of the cumbersome procedures, only 37 rationalization proposals have been implemented. Some workers are therefore unwilling to make any more suggestions. Workers say: We are determined to improve product quality, but we hope that the work of the departments can catch up.

　　Not only are the departments unable to handle rationalization proposals in a timely manner, but they are also slow to solve some urgent technical problems, failing to keep up with the demands of the workers. Some technicians are busy but unable to go deep into the field to guide technical work in a timely manner. Problems are often dragged on until Monday before a technical meeting is convened for slow research. Some workers say: We don't want Monday's technicians. One workshop raised the question of whether the straps of women's shoes were too wide and asked a technician surnamed Huang in the technical department. This technician said: "This is not my business, you go ask Technician Xie." Technician Xie also ignored it and pushed it to the laboratory. The laboratory required the workshop to submit a written application before it could be dealt with. The workshop wrote an application, but after four or five days, the technician had not come to deal with it, so they had to inquire with the laboratory again. The laboratory could not find the application and had to "wait until the application is found before solving it." This phenomenon of no one being responsible for technical work is not isolated. And the leaders are still tolerating this chaotic phenomenon. They do not understand that if the work of the departments lags behind for a long time, it will be impossible to quickly improve product quality.

　　Because the work of the departments is lagging behind, the work of trial-producing new varieties is also not good enough. And doing a good job in the trial production of new varieties is a prerequisite for improving the quality of rubber shoes. In the past two months, the leaders of this factory have rarely personally controlled the work of new varieties. The technical preparations for many new varieties are not sufficient, the design dimensions are not accurate, and the tools are not right. The quality of the new style of women’s shoes and labor shoes is not high. When producing the new style of labor shoes, the work was reworked three times, and they still could not be shipped. One workshop, because it did not replace the tools according to the requirements of the new varieties, caused the heels of forty or fifty pairs of new style women's shoes to crack. As of February 23, the entire factory had already produced 142 pairs of substandard new style rubber shoes.

　　To improve product quality, it is necessary to vigorously strengthen the leadership of technical work and criticize the tendency to not pay attention to technical organization work. Some people who do political work like to do the work of the workers, but do not like to do the work of engineers and technicians. Now all the workers in the factory are enthusiastically launching socialist competitions, but the engineers and technicians have not yet moved. The Party organization must quickly correct this abnormal situation and fully mobilize the masses in order to produce new styles of high-quality rubber shoes more quickly.

    要多生产式样新质量好的胶鞋
    本报记者　陈迹
    长春国营第八橡胶厂一向生产胶鞋；但是，如何生产出质量高、成本低的胶鞋，一直是全厂的中心问题。
    这几年来，全厂职工虽然努力提高胶鞋质量，降低成本，但是仍然不能满足群众的要求。有些工厂工人说：八厂的胶鞋花样少，不美观。农业生产合作社社员提出：球鞋尖头不好，穿了常灌水；能不能做出像皮鞋那样的胶鞋？不少运动员反映：八厂的球鞋容易破底；咱们需要鞋底结实的球鞋。年轻的妇女希望鞋帮瘦一些，布面花样多一些。机关工作人员还觉得：一双球鞋六、七元，只穿上三个来月就坏了，还不如买双皮鞋合算。在长春，不管那个商店里，都摆满了式样单调的灰溜溜的球鞋。因为胶鞋花样不多、质量不高，一些素来穿胶鞋的人改穿了皮鞋。胶鞋常常积压。现在第八橡胶厂仓库内还积压着70万多双老式样的球鞋。
    摆在第八橡胶厂全体职工面前的最尖锐的问题，就是赶快生产式样新的好胶鞋。去年第八橡胶厂为了提高胶鞋质量，增加品种，曾经发动群众做了不少工作。工程技术人员访问农村，征求意见，并且着手设计十多种适合群众需要的新式样的胶鞋。这当然是正确的。
    但是今年1—2月，第八橡胶厂在制定全面规划的时候，发生了一个问题，就是大量增加产量呢，还是努力提高质量呢？工厂的领导人觉得：“别的工厂都纷纷要提前一年完成五年计划，咱们也得大量增加产量”。他们对于如何提高质量、增加品种这些最迫切的问题研究不够，却提出今年要生产800万多双胶鞋，比原计划增加一倍。商业部门听说第八橡胶厂要生产这么多胶鞋，不大愿意要，认为现有的胶鞋还卖不出去，如果再增加生产质量不高的胶鞋，那就更要积压了。轻工业部看到这个计划，也不同意，指出不应该盲目增产，而应该在提高质量的基础上增加产量。第八橡胶厂只好又改变计划，忙了一个多月，修改了七次，最后才确定今年只生产370万多双球鞋，其中要生产出120万多双新式样的胶鞋。
    现在计划虽然做出来了，领导工作还晚了一步。职工群众在社会主义改造高潮的鼓舞下，纷纷推广先进经验，提出合理化建议。但是，领导人员没有及时地引导群众努力提高胶鞋质量。在两三个月内，职工们提出1，200多件合理化建议，其中关于提高质量的建议就有400多件。对于这些合理化建议，是怎样处理的呢？因为前些时候领导工作人员关在房里忙规划，没有来得及亲自过问，许多合理化建议在科室之间转来转去，很少用到生产上去。需要上面鉴定的合理化建议，要通过六、七道手续，才能实现。因为手续繁多，已经实现的合理化建议只有37件。有些工人因此不大愿意再提了。工人说：咱们有决心提高产品质量，但是希望科室工作赶上来。
    科室不但不能及时处理合理化建议，而且在解决一些迫切的技术问题上，动作迟缓，赶不上工人群众的要求。有些技术员忙忙碌碌，不能深入现场及时指导技术工作。有了问题常常拖到星期一，才召开技术会议慢慢研究。有的工人说：我们不要星期一的技术员。有个车间提出女鞋的带子是否太宽的问题，询问技术科一位姓黄的技术员，这位技术员说：“这不是我的事，你们去问谢技术员。”谢技术员也不管，推给试验室。试验室要车间提出申请书，才能过问。车间写了申请书，过了四、五天，还不见技术员来过问，只好又询问试验室。试验室已经找不到那份申请书，必须“等查出申请书来再解决”。像这种在技术工作上无人负责的现象，并不是个别的。而领导人员还在容忍这种混乱现象。他们不了解，如果科室工作长期落后，就不可能迅速提高产品质量。
    因为科室工作落后，试制新品种的工作也不够好。而做好新品种试制工作，又是改善胶鞋质量的前提。最近两个月来，这个厂的领导人员很少亲自掌握新品种的工作。许多新品种的技术准备工作不够，设计尺寸不准确，工具不对头。新式的坤鞋和劳动鞋的质量不高。在生产新式的劳动鞋的时候，反工了三次，还不能出厂。有个车间因为没有按照新品种的要求更换工具，把四、五十双新式女鞋的后根都崩裂了。到2月23日为止，全厂已经出现了142双不合标准的新式胶鞋。
    要提高产品质量，必须大力加强对于技术工作的领导，批判那种不重视技术组织工作的偏向。一些做政治工作的人喜欢做工人群众的工作，不喜欢做工程技术人员的工作。现在全厂工人都热火朝天地展开社会主义竞赛，而工程技术人员还没有动。党组织必须迅速纠正这种不正常的情况，全面地发动群众，才能更快地生产出新式样的质量高的胶鞋来。
