The socialist transformation movement is progressing rapidly in both urban and rural areas. 78% of farmers across the country have joined agricultural producers' cooperatives; over 70% of cities have essentially achieved the cooperativization of handicrafts and the overall public-private partnership of capitalist industry and commerce. As Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out: "The political situation in our country has undergone fundamental changes." The central task of the people of the whole country at present is to develop industrial and agricultural production and construction in all aspects "more, faster, better and more economically," and strive to complete and overfulfill the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule; the working class of our country must first shoulder the responsibility of realizing this glorious task in industrial construction, and greet the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China with practical actions.

Our working class has demonstrated enthusiasm for building socialism since the founding of the country. This enthusiasm for building socialism is concentratedly manifested in the labor competitions carried out over the years. In the early days of liberation, in order to rapidly restore the national economy and heal the wounds of war, the broad masses of workers carried out the movement to donate materials, and then carried out the movement to create new records. After the US imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea, workers across the country launched a patriotic labor competition to resist US aggression and aid Korea. After our country entered the period of planned economic construction, workers across the country responded to the call of the Party Central Committee and launched the movement to increase production and practice economy. At the initiative of advanced producers, a nationwide technical innovation movement was launched in 1954. Although the slogan of "technical innovation" was not accurate and perfect enough, the technical innovation movement was successful in that it further guided the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers in the direction of improving technology, raising technology, and learning and mastering new technologies. Since the official announcement of the first Five-Year Plan, especially after the publication of the Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the issue of agricultural cooperativization, a new upsurge of socialist competition has been set off among workers across the country.

In this new upsurge, the broad masses of workers have demonstrated unprecedented labor enthusiasm in supporting agricultural cooperativization and agricultural production, and in completing the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Not only have production workers actively participated in the competition, but more and more engineering and technical personnel have also actively participated in the competition. They have put forward guarantees to complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, actively learning advanced experiences from the Soviet Union and our country, improving technology, and constantly breaking outdated norms; they oppose right-leaning conservative thinking, widely carry out criticism and self-criticism from the bottom up, and put forward tens of thousands of rationalization proposals. In the competition, thousands of advanced producers have emerged, they have created many advanced working methods, and constantly tapped the potential of enterprises. Learning from advanced producers and striving to become an advanced producer has become the demand and action of the broad masses of workers. The ranks of advanced producers are rapidly expanding. The advanced producer movement is emerging on a broad mass scale.

The emergence of a new upsurge of socialist competition is an inevitable trend in the development of our country's socialist economy. Under the people's democratic system, the status of our country's working class has undergone fundamental changes, and the lives of workers have been considerably improved. The broad masses of workers have profoundly experienced the consistency of national interests and individual interests in practical life, and their socialist consciousness has been greatly enhanced. In recent years, with the help of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, new technologies have been constantly growing, and the technical level of workers has also significantly improved. At the same time, under the leadership of the Party, factories and mines have carried out a series of reforms in management systems, and the Party, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League have also accumulated certain experiences in leading competitions. All of this has provided broad conditions for the working class of our country to fully exert their talents. Due to these reasons, coupled with the promotion of the upsurge of the agricultural cooperativization movement and the capitalist industrial and commercial transformation movement since the second half of 1955, the current new upsurge of socialist competition in industry and transportation has emerged.

Trade union organizations at all levels must stand at the forefront of the new upsurge of socialist competition, deeply care for and cherish the growth and development of new forces, actively support the pioneering initiatives of advanced producers, vigorously promote their advanced experiences, and constantly improve labor productivity in order to accelerate the process of socialist construction. Therefore, the Tenth Meeting of the Presidium of the Seventh Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions believes that it is timely, necessary, and of extremely great significance to launch an advanced producer movement nationwide to complete and overfulfill the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

The essence of the advanced producer movement is a movement to break outdated norms and create new advanced norms on the basis of mastering technology and improving working methods, and it is a movement to promote advanced experiences and organize the broad masses of workers to learn from advanced producers. The advanced producer movement requires the advanced to actively help the backward, and the backward to strive to learn from the advanced, in order to achieve the goal of common improvement; at the same time, it requires further advancement on the basis of advancement. The advanced producer movement requires all groups, sections, work teams, workshops, and enterprises to strive to reach advanced levels; it requires all workers—production workers, construction workers, transportation workers, commercial staff, engineering and technical personnel, clerks, scientific workers, cultural workers, educational workers, health care workers, state organ staff—to carry out labor according to advanced methods. Every individual and every unit can strive to become an advanced producer or advanced worker, or strive to become an advanced unit in all aspects. We believe that individuals or units that meet any of the following advanced deeds, after mass evaluation, and with the guarantee of completing tasks and ensuring quality, can be awarded the honorary title of advanced producer, advanced worker, or advanced unit by trade union organizations at all levels and corresponding administrative departments:

1.  Achieving significant quantitative and qualitative results in completing and overfulfilling state plans ahead of schedule;

2.  Making significant achievements in diligently saving raw materials, materials, fuel, and electricity, and in reducing costs by eliminating defective products and substandard products;

3.  Achieving good results in learning and promoting advanced experiences or in mastering new technologies and trial-producing new products;

4.  Achieving significant results in improving technical equipment, improving operating methods, improving technological processes, ensuring safe operation, safe driving, and improving labor organization;

5.  Gaining the praise of the people for completely ensuring the needs of production supply and the people's lives, and achieving significant results in accelerating capital turnover, reducing operating expenses, reducing cargo losses, and improving service quality;

6.  Achieving significant results in cultural, scientific, educational, health, and health care undertakings;

7.  Being able to regularly help workers or backward units that do not meet quotas to reach advanced levels;

8.  Achieving excellent results in working in state organs.

Among them, ensuring excellent quality is a necessary condition. If other indicators are met, but quality indicators cannot be met, they cannot be called advanced producers, advanced workers, or advanced units.

Various industries and enterprises should also formulate specific requirements and indicators based on their own characteristics, and adopt diverse forms of competition to widely mobilize workers to carry out the advanced producer movement.

The task of trade union organizations at all levels is to, under the leadership of the local Party committees and enterprise Party committees, effectively organize the advanced producer movement and persist in it, so that it becomes a powerful driving force for organized, planned, and comprehensive improvement of production. It is necessary to mobilize the broad masses, overcome backward conservative ideas, and, in conjunction with the administration, formulate advanced technical norms and advanced production plans based on the requirements of advanced producers and various advanced initiatives. To this end, we believe that trade union organizations must act in unison with enterprise administrations and the Communist Youth League under the leadership of the Party, work together, and take the following measures:

First, trade union grassroots organizations should convene worker representative conferences or mass production meetings in conjunction with enterprise administrations, widely mobilize the masses, discuss state plans, formulate specific measures to complete state plans ahead of schedule, carry out criticism and self-criticism from the bottom up, boldly expose all errors and shortcomings that hinder production development, actively put forward rationalization proposals, tap potential, find shortcuts, and break through backward links in production. Enterprise management organs should boldly promote the initiative of the masses, mobilize the masses to discuss planning indicators from the bottom up, and re-examine various norms, revise backward norms, improve technological processes, and improve management systems through a method of layer-by-layer discussion and level-by-level balancing, and formulate advanced production technology and financial plans.

Second, vigorously organize workers to learn from the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union and the advanced producers of our country, so that advanced experiences become the wealth mastered by the broad masses of workers. Trade union organizations should, in conjunction with the administration, universally organize advanced experience schools and invite advanced producers to impart their experiences. Various industrial trade unions and local trade unions should also exchange the experiences of advanced producers on a larger scale through inter-factory competitions and same-trade competitions. While promoting the experiences of advanced producers, we must organize the technical learning of the workers, and first of all, we should improve the technical level of advanced producers in order to cultivate a large number of new talents who master modern technology.

Third, constantly educate workers to improve product quality and increase product varieties, and on the premise of ensuring improved product quality and increased product varieties, achieve increased output, save raw materials, materials, fuel, and electricity, reduce costs, and constantly improve labor productivity.

Fourth, widely organize mutual assistance and cooperation among workers, and cultivate the noble morality of communism in which the advanced help the backward. Organize advanced workers to help backward workers, organize scientific workers and engineering and technical personnel to closely cooperate with production workers, organize veteran workers to help new workers, and organize various units within enterprises to coordinate with each other. Mobilize the masses to sign teaching contracts, apprenticeship contracts, and contact contracts. Organize advanced enterprises to help backward enterprises in order to achieve common improvement.

Fifth, trade union organizations at all levels must, in conjunction with the administration, support the development of the advanced producer movement in all aspects, especially to help workers solve all difficult problems that hinder the development of the movement, and create conditions for the smooth development of this movement. Trade union organizations must supervise and assist the administration to seriously and earnestly handle every suggestion from the workers, actively support the initiatives of advanced producers, timely summarize the experiences of advanced producers, improve the work of management departments, especially technical departments and supply departments, and do a good job in a series of technical measures and organizational measures in order to ensure that advanced experiences are rapidly promoted; and advocate the signing of contact contracts between departments in order to ensure balanced production. At the same time, it is also necessary to take active measures to improve labor conditions, prevent work-related accidents, educate workers to strictly abide by safety technical regulations, and not unilaterally emphasize "breaking with convention" and arbitrarily violate them; warmly care for the lives of the masses, and improve wage and bonus work. The result of the development of the advanced producer movement will inevitably greatly improve labor productivity, and therefore it is necessary to ensure that the lives of workers can be appropriately improved accordingly.

Finally, trade union organizations at all levels must, under the leadership of the Party committee, actively improve their work and eliminate the serious phenomenon of leadership lagging behind the masses that still exists. The key to overcoming backward conservatism lies in going deep among the masses and going deep into production. To this end, leading cadres of trade union organizations at all levels must go deep into the grassroots, go deep among the masses, help grassroots cadres, grasp the situation, sum up experiences, and guide the movement, especially to strengthen in-depth and meticulous specific organizational work, resolutely oppose all formalism that only catches the wave and does not focus on practicality, so that this movement can be widely and continuously developed.

    中华全国总工会第七届执行委员会主席团第十次会议
    关于开展先进生产者运动的决议
    （1956年2月9日中华全国总工会第七届执行委员会主席团第十次会议通过）
    （一）
    目前城乡社会主义改造运动正在飞速地进展着。全国78％的农户已经加入了农业生产合作社；70％以上的城市已经基本上实现了手工业的合作化和资本主义工商业的全行业公私合营。正如毛泽东主席所指出的：“目前我们国家的政治形势已经起了根本的变化。”当前全国人民的中心任务，就是要“又多、又快、又好、又省”地发展工农业生产和各方面的建设工作，争取提前完成和超额完成第一个五年计划；我国工人阶级必须首先担负起工业建设方面实现这一光荣任务的责任，并且以实际行动，来迎接中国共产党第八次全国代表大会。
    （二）
    我国工人阶级，从全国解放的时候起，就表现了建设社会主义的积极性。这种建设社会主义的积极性，集中地表现在历年来所开展的劳动竞赛中。解放初期，广大职工群众为迅速恢复国民经济，医治战争创伤，开展了献纳器材运动，进而又开展了创造新纪录运动。在美帝国主义发动侵朝战争以后，全国职工又开展了抗美援朝的爱国主义劳动竞赛。在我国进入有计划的经济建设时期以后，全国职工又响应了党中央的号召，开展了增产节约运动，并且在先进生产者的倡议下，在1954年开展了全国规模的技术革新运动。虽然“技术革新”的口号不够确切和完善，但是技术革新运动是有成绩的，它把广大职工群众的劳动热情进一步引导到改进技术、提高技术、学习和掌握新技术的方向。自从第一个五年计划正式公布以后，特别是中国共产党第七届中央委员会第六次全体会议（扩大）关于农业合作化问题的决议公布以后，全国职工又掀起了社会主义竞赛的新的高涨。
    在这一新的高涨中，广大职工群众为支援农业合作化和农业生产，为提前完成第一个五年计划，表现了空前的劳动热情。不仅是生产工人积极地参加了竞赛，而且有愈来愈多的工程技术人员也积极地参加了竞赛。他们纷纷提出了提前完成第一个五年计划的保证，积极地学习苏联的和我国的先进经验，提高技术，不断地打破陈旧定额；他们反对右倾保守思想，广泛地开展了自下而上的批评和自我批评，提出了数以万计的合理化建议。在竞赛中涌现了成千上万的先进生产者，他们创造了许多先进的工作方法，不断地挖掘着企业的潜在力量。向先进生产者看齐，争取做一个先进生产者，已经成为广大职工群众的要求和行动。先进生产者的队伍正在迅速扩大。先进生产者运动正在以广泛的群众性的规模出现。
    社会主义竞赛的新的高涨的出现，是我国社会主义经济发展中的必然趋势。在人民民主制度下，我国工人阶级的地位已经起了根本的变化，职工群众的生活已经得到了相当的改善。广大职工群众在实际生活中已经深刻地体验到国家利益和个人利益的一致性，他们的社会主义觉悟已经大大地提高了。几年来，在苏联和各人民民主国家的帮助下，新技术不断增长，职工技术水平也有显著的提高。同时，在党的领导下，厂矿企业进行了一系列的管理制度的改革，党、工会、青年团也积累了一定的领导竞赛的经验。这一切都为我国工人阶级充分发挥自己的才能提供了广阔的条件。由于这些原因，加上1955年下半年以来农业合作化运动和资本主义工商业改造运动的高潮的推动，就出现了目前的工业和交通运输业方面的社会主义竞赛的新的高涨。
    工会各级组织必须站在社会主义竞赛的新的高涨的前面，深切地关怀和爱护新生力量的生长和发展，积极地支持先进生产者的创举，大力地推广他们的先进经验，不断地提高劳动生产率，以便加速社会主义建设的进程。因此，中华全国总工会第七届执行委员会主席团第十次会议认为，目前在全国范围内开展一个为提前完成和超额完成第一个五年计划的先进生产者运动是适时的、必要的，是具有极为重大的意义的。
    （三）
    先进生产者运动实质上就是在掌握技术、改进工作方法的基础上打破陈旧的定额、创造新的先进定额的运动，就是推广先进经验、组织广大职工群众向先进生产者看齐的运动。先进生产者运动要求先进的积极地帮助落后的，落后的努力地学习先进的，以求达到共同提高的目的；同时，要求在先进的基础上更加先进。先进生产者运动要求所有小组、工段、工作队、车间和企业努力达到先进水平；要求全体职工——生产工人、建筑工人、交通运输工人、商业工作人员、工程技术人员、职员、科学工作者、文化工作者、教育工作者、卫生保健工作者、国家机关工作人员，都按照先进方法来进行劳动。每一个人和每一个单位都可以从各方面来争取做一个先进生产者、先进工作者，或者争取成为一个先进单位。我们认为在保证完成任务和保证质量的条件下，只要具有以下一项先进事迹的个人或单位，经过群众评选，工会各级组织和相应的行政部门就可以授予他们以先进生产者、先进工作者或先进单位的荣誉称号：
    1、在提前完成和超额完成国家计划方面获得数量上和质量上的显著成绩；
    2、努力节约原料、材料、燃料、电力，不出废品，不出次品，降低成本有显著成绩；
    3、在学习和推广先进经验或在掌握新技术、试制新产品方面有良好成绩；
    4、在改进技术设备、改进操作方法、改进工艺过程、保证安全运转、安全行车和改善劳动组织方面有显著成绩；
    5、在完满地保证生产供应和人民生活需要方面获得人民的赞许，并且在加速资金周转、降低经营费用、减少货物损耗、提高服务质量方面有显著成绩；
    6、在文化、科学、教育、卫生、保健事业中有显著成绩；
    7、能够经常帮助达不到定额的工人或落后的单位达到先进水平；
    8、在国家机关工作中有优秀成绩。
    其中保证优等质量是一个必需的条件。如果达到了其他各项指标，而不能达到质量指标，就不能称为先进生产者、先进工作者或先进单位。
    各产业和各企业还应该根据自己的特点，规定出具体的要求和指标，采用多样的竞赛形式，来广泛发动职工群众开展先进生产者运动。
    （四）
    工会各级组织的任务就是要在当地党委和企业党委的领导下，切实地把先进生产者运动组织起来，并且坚持下去，使它成为有组织的、有计划的、全面改进生产的强大动力。就是要根据先进生产者的要求，和各种先进的倡议，发动广大群众，克服落后保守思想，会同行政制定先进的技术定额，制定先进的生产计划。为此目的，我们认为工会组织必须在党的领导下，协同企业行政和青年团一致行动，共同努力，采取以下几项措施：
    第一、工会基层组织应该会同企业行政召开职工代表大会或群众生产会议，广泛发动群众，讨论国家计划，制定出提前完成国家计划的具体措施，开展自下而上的批评和自我批评，大胆揭发一切阻碍生产发展的错误和缺点，积极提出合理化建议，挖潜力，找窍门，突破生产上的落后环节。企业管理机关应该大胆发扬群众的主动性，发动群众自下而上地讨论计划指标，通过层层讨论、逐级平衡的办法来重新审查各种定额，修改落后的定额，改善工艺过程，改进管理制度，制定出先进的生产技术财务计划。
    第二、大力地组织职工群众学习苏联先进经验和我国先进生产者的经验，务使先进经验成为广大职工群众所掌握的财富。工会组织应该会同行政普遍举办先进经验学校，邀请先进生产者传授自己的经验。各产业工会和地方工会还应该通过厂际竞赛和同工种竞赛，在更大范围内交流先进生产者的经验。在推广先进生产者经验的同时，必须组织好职工群众的技术学习，首先应该提高先进生产者的技术水平，以便从中培养出大批掌握现代技术的新人材。
    第三、经常地教育职工提高产品质量和增加产品品种，在保证提高产品质量和增加产品品种的前提下做到增加产量，节约原料、材料、燃料、电力，降低成本，不断地提高劳动生产率。
    第四、广泛地组织职工之间的互助合作，培养先进帮助落后的共产主义的高尚道德。组织先进工人帮助落后工人，组织科学工作者、工程技术人员同生产工人密切合作，组织老工人帮助新工人，组织企业内部各个单位协同配合。发动群众签订教学合同、师徒合同、联系合同。组织先进的企业帮助落后的企业，以求共同提高。
    第五、工会各级组织必须会同行政从各个方面来支持先进生产者运动的开展，特别是要帮助职工群众解决一切阻碍运动发展的困难问题，为这个运动的顺利开展创造条件。工会组织必须督促和协助行政认真严肃地处理来自职工群众的每一个建议，积极地支持先进生产者的倡议，及时地总结先进生产者的经验，改善管理部门特别是技术部门、供应部门的工作，做好一系列的技术措施和组织措施，以便保证先进经验得到迅速的推广；并且提倡签订部门和部门之间的联系合同，以便保证均衡生产。同时，还必须采取积极措施来改善劳动条件，防止工伤事故，教育职工群众严格遵守安全技术规程，不要片面强调“打破常规”，任意违反；热情地关怀群众的生活，改进工资和奖励工作。开展先进生产者运动的结果，必然要大大地提高劳动生产率，因而也必须相应地保证职工生活能够得到适当的改善。
    最后，工会各级组织必须在党委的领导下，积极改善自己的工作，消除目前还存在着的领导落后于群众的严重现象。克服落后保守的关键在于深入群众，深入生产。为此，工会各级组织的领导干部必须深入基层，深入群众，帮助基层干部，掌握情况，总结经验，指导运动，尤其是要加强深入细致的具体组织工作，坚决反对一切只赶浪头，不务实际的形式主义，使这个运动能够广泛地持续地开展起来。
