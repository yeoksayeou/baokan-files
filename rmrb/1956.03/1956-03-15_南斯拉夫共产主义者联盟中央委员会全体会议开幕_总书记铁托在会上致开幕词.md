Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, March 14th: According to the Yugoslav News Agency, Belgrade, the plenary session of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia opened in Belgrade on the morning of March 13th.

The agenda of this meeting includes: 1. Some issues concerning the work of the League of Communists, with a report by Rankovic, member of the Executive Committee of the Central Committee; 2. On youth work, with a report by Stambolic, member of the Executive Committee of the Central Committee; 3. Other matters.

General Secretary of the Central Committee Tito delivered the opening address at the meeting. He said that Yugoslavia has achieved great successes in every field. The reason why these achievements could be obtained in foreign policy is that the entire people and the League of Communists support the foreign policy pursued by Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia's face has changed greatly due to the great achievements in industrialization and comprehensive development. If various subjective shortcomings had been corrected in time in the past, then this change would have been even greater than it is today.

Tito said that the purpose of convening this Central Committee plenary session is to discuss some important issues in the general work of the Communists and especially in youth work. He said that after the Sixth Congress of the League of Communists, a certain degree of inertia had arisen in the work of the Communists.

Tito believes that one of the basic shortcomings of the Communists is that they cannot adapt to new situations. He said that in the vigorous development of social life and industrialization, there have been and still are certain difficulties, which are not only objective difficulties but also largely of a subjective nature. These difficulties must be seriously considered so that the work of the Communists can achieve greater success.

Referring to the resolutions of the Sixth Congress on the further development of socialism and on the tasks of the Communists, Tito emphasized that confusion has arisen in the minds of some people: in other words, they believe that the social system no longer needs an organized political party like the Communist Party, because the central economic and administrative powers of the state have been weakened. This is a misunderstanding, because these people believe that, due to the weakening of certain powers of the state and the decentralization of economic and government management powers, the Communists no longer bear the arduous tasks that they had to bear before. These Communists have not treated this issue with the necessary seriousness. They believe that simply distributing many powers to a wide range of people and to the broad masses will spread socialist consciousness and make it universal automatically. Many Communists have failed to realize that the decentralization of economic and government management powers requires them to make greater efforts if the new social system is to develop as it should.

Tito then pointed out the ideological weaknesses of the Communists' political activities. That is, a part of the League of Communists, which has more than 600,000 members, does not have the necessary theoretical level and pays too little attention to further improving ideological awareness based on the actual situation.

Tito said that many Communists have forgotten their tasks as revolutionaries and political educators of the masses. On the contrary, they have gone to another extreme, relying solely on orders, thinking that they can arbitrarily drive the people and demanding that their words be accepted as the most authoritative.

Tito pointed out that the main task of Communists, not only in Yugoslavia but also anywhere else in the world, is to become educators of the masses. But if the Communists lack the necessary theoretical and political cultivation, if they cannot become a unified organization with all the qualities of a revolutionary organization that the League of Communists must have—firm discipline and a unified team—then they cannot become educators of the masses. There must be this ideological organization to supervise the work of educating and re-educating the people in the spirit of socialism.

Tito said that Yugoslav society is indeed socialist in nature, which is different from Western democracy. Although there is a correct direction in Yugoslavia's domestic development, various alien ideas and influences have begun to be felt, and these ideas and influences can still be felt more strongly now. Of course, this is not as dangerous as factors that might endanger revolutionary achievements, but it is dangerous because it hinders the development of socialism and makes it difficult to properly educate Yugoslav citizens.

Tito said that many Communists have become ordinary bureaucrats, neglecting everything and only thinking about their narrow little circles. A Communist in any position must never forget his basic responsibility: to work as a Communist and an internationalist. There should be an internationalist vision of various phenomena. His main attention must be focused on this aspect; if he can correctly understand his basic task, he can correctly carry out his work in his post.

Finally, Tito talked about youth work, explaining the role of Communists in giving correct socialist education to the youth and making them builders of socialist society. He emphasized that the youth should be rescued from various influences that do not conform to socialism and from various reactionary remnants, and that the youth should be protected from the impact of various Western destructive ideas and influences that are now infiltrating Yugoslav social life.

After Tito delivered the opening address, Rankovic made a report on the first item on the agenda. Then, the meeting discussed Rankovic's report.

    南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟中央委员会全体会议开幕
    总书记铁托在会上致开幕词
    新华社14日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社贝尔格莱德讯：南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟中央委员会全体会议，3月13日上午在贝尔格莱德开幕。
    这次会议的议程包括：一、有关共产主义者联盟工作的一些问题，报告人是中央委员会执行委员会委员兰科维奇；二、关于青年工作，报告人是中央委员会执行委员会委员斯坦鲍利奇；三、其他事项。
    中央委员会总书记铁托在会上致开幕词。他说，南斯拉夫已经在每一个领域内获得了巨大的成就。在外交政策方面所以能够获得这些成就，是因为全体人民和共产主义者联盟支持南斯拉夫所执行的外交政策。由于在工业化方面以及全面发展方面获得了巨大的成就，南斯拉夫的面貌已经大为改变。如果在以前及时地纠正各种主观主义的缺点的话，那末这种改变甚至比今天还要大些。
    铁托说，召开这次中央全会为的是讨论共产主义者的一般工作以及特别是青年工作中的某些重要问题。他说，在共产主义者联盟第六次代表大会以后，在共产主义者的工作中已经产生了一定程度的惰性。
    铁托认为共产主义者们的基本缺点之一是他们不能适应新的情况。他说，在社会生活和工业化蓬勃发展当中，曾经存在而且现在仍然存在着某些困难，这些困难不仅是客观的困难而且很大部分是属于主观性质的，必须认真考虑这些困难，以便共产主义者的工作能够取得更大的成就。
    谈到第六次代表大会关于社会主义的进一步发展和关于共产主义者的任务的决议时，铁托强调说，某些人的思想中已经产生了混乱：换句话说，他们认为，社会制度中不再需要像共产党那样一个有组织的政党了，因为国家的中央经济和行政职权已经削弱了。这是发生误解了，因为这些人认为，由于国家的某些职权的削弱、由于经济和政府的管理权力的分散，共产主义者不再负有像他们以前不得不负起的那种艰巨任务了。这些共产主义者没有以必要的认真态度来对待这个问题，他们认为，单单把许多职权分配给广泛的人们、分配给广大群众，社会主义的觉悟就会传播开来，就会自动普遍起来。许多共产主义者未能认识到分散经济和政府的管理权力要求他们作更大的努力，如果要使新的社会制度得到应有的发展的话。
    铁托然后指出共产主义者的政治活动在思想方面的弱点。那就是，共有六十多万盟员的共产主义者联盟中有一部分人没有具备必要的理论水平，而且太不注意根据现实情况来进一步提高思想意识了。
    铁托说，许多共产主义者已经忘掉了他们作为革命者和群众的政治教育者的任务。他们反而走到另一个极端，他们仅仅依靠命令，以为他们可以随意驱使人民；要求把他们的话作为最权威的话来接受。
    铁托指出，不仅南斯拉夫的而且世界任何其他地方的共产主义者的主要任务都是要成为群众的教育者。但是如果共产主义者缺乏必需的理论和政治修养的话，如果他们不能成为一个统一的组织，使这个组织具有共产主义者联盟所必须具有的坚定的纪律和统一的队伍的革命组织的一切品质、具有坚强的纪律和统一的队伍的话，那么他们就不能成为群众的教育者。必须有这个思想组织，来监督以社会主义精神教育和再教育人民的工作。
    铁托说，南斯拉夫社会的确是社会主义性质的，它同西方的民主不同。尽管南斯拉夫国内发展中有了正确的方针，但是已经开始感到各种不同的异己的思想和影响，而且现在仍旧可以更加强烈地感到这些思想和影响。当然，这还不是像可能会危及革命成就的因素那样危险，但是这是危险的，因为它妨碍社会主义的发展和正确地教育南斯拉夫公民。并且使得这些工作变得很困难。
    铁托说，许多共产主义者变成了普通的事务主义者，他们忽视一切事情而只想到他们的狭隘的小圈子。一个共产主义者在任何职位上都永远不能忘记他的基本责任：以一个共产主义者、一个国际主义者的身份来工作。对各种现象应该有国际主义者的先见。他的主要注意力必须放在这方面；如果他能够正确地认识他的基本任务，他就能在他的岗位上正确地进行工作。
    最后，铁托谈到青年工作，他说明了共产主义者在对青年进行正确的社会主义教育和使青年变成社会主义社会的建设者方面的作用。他强调应该把青年从不符合于社会主义的各种影响和各种反动的残余中挽救出来，应该保护青年不受到现在正在渗入南斯拉夫社会生活的各种西方的破坏性思想和影响的冲击。
    在铁托致了开幕词以后，兰科维奇就第一项议程作了报告。接着，会议对兰科维奇的报告进行了讨论。
