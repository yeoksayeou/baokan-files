    Introducing "The Victory of the Soviet Collective Farm System"
    Rong Jingben
    The book "The Victory of the Soviet Collective Farm System" by the Soviet author Krayev, recently published by People's Publishing House, is a relatively systematic work describing the history of collective farm construction and has received high praise in the Soviet Union.
    In the past, although the Soviet Union published many books on collective farm issues, most of them only talked about individual stages and individual problems in the construction of collective farms. The main advantage of Krayev's book is that it comprehensively and profoundly elucidates the basic theoretical issues and practical issues of each stage of the entire socialist transformation of agriculture. In this book, the author not only explains the Marxist-Leninist doctrine on the socialist transformation of agriculture, thoroughly criticizes the bourgeois apologists' fallacies such as the "stability" of small-scale peasant economy and the "law of diminishing returns of land," but also demonstrates the superiority of the collective farm system.
    Another difference between this book and other works of similar nature is that it collects a large amount of practical material for the first time, illustrating the establishment of the first state-owned farms and collective farms in the Soviet Union and the development of various cooperatives in the period before overall collectivization. In fact, the initial state-owned farms, collective farms, and cooperatives were very important; they paved the way for new socialist modes of production in the countryside, accumulated experience, and created all the necessary conditions. These issues were generally discussed very little or superficially in other past works.
    Another advantage of this book is that it describes in detail the tortuous process of the Soviet Union resolving various complex problems in the construction of collective farms. Through these examples, it vividly introduces the Soviet Union's experience in building collective farms.
    After collective farms were established in large numbers in the Soviet Union, the Party pointed out that the main task of collective farm construction was to consolidate them organizationally and economically. The most important indicator of whether a collective farm is consolidated is whether production can develop and whether labor productivity can be improved. To achieve these goals, it is necessary to vigorously develop the public economy, correctly organize labor, implement a rational labor remuneration system, and continuously improve agricultural technology, etc.
    After the means of production of the peasants are merged, the public property of the collective farm is formed. This is also the starting point of the public economy. Its rapid growth is a major sign of the consolidation of collective farms. In order to meet the individual needs of the peasants, in addition to this main public economy, members are also allowed to engage in certain sideline occupations and hold small plots of land next to their houses. But the important thing is to correctly combine the public economy and the individual economy, and it is necessary to first ensure the rapid growth of the public economy, which plays a decisive role in the farm. The growth of the public economy of Soviet collective farms is clearly reflected in the merger of small farms, which is an inevitable requirement for the development of collective farms. Because after small farms are merged into large farms, they can better exert the superiority of large-scale socialist agriculture, create favorable conditions for further use of machinery technology, better use of land, and improvement of farming and animal husbandry skills, and for developing diversified operations and comprehensively developing collective farms.
    As a result of collectivization, the individual and scattered labor of peasants has become direct social labor. Therefore, it is also very important to correctly organize and use labor. This book devotes a special chapter to discussing the issue of labor organization and labor remuneration in collective farms. The author believes that correctly organizing and using labor and rationally distributing the fruits of labor are of particular importance for the consolidation and development of collective farms.
    Initially, there was a tendency towards egalitarianism in the labor organization of Soviet collective farms. Everyone took turns working, feeding horses today, plowing the fields tomorrow, and even taking turns serving as chairman. Members had to gather at the management committee every day to find out what they were going to do today. As a result, the work was chaotic and the efficiency was very low. After considering and summarizing the experience of advanced collective farms, the Party and government proposed taking the fixed production team as the basic form of labor organization. This production team is fixed all year round, with fixed staff, fixed work areas, and fixed production tools. The staffing is selected and equipped according to the production principle, and they must be responsible for completing the prescribed tasks. After 1931, production teams were widely developed. The establishment and development of production teams quickly solved the problem of specialization of collective farmers, eliminated the phenomenon of no one being responsible, carried out socialist competition, and implemented the principle of distribution according to work, thereby greatly improving labor productivity. Of course, this basic form of fixed production team does not exclude the possibility of creating auxiliary forms of labor organization when performing various agricultural tasks. When needed, necessary changes and temporary adjustments can be made to establish auxiliary forms such as production groups.
    In addition to labor organization, there is also the issue of reasonable labor remuneration in the established collective farms. As everyone knows, the labor remuneration received by Soviet collective farmers today is calculated on the basis of workdays. However, the workday was not universally applied in collective farms all at once. The Soviet Union also went through a tortuous path on the issue of labor remuneration. There was a time when collective farms distributed according to population, needs, land, or the amount of shares. The implementation of this most imperfect method and form, which reflected the remnants of petty-bourgeois ideology and was not in line with socialist interests, not only violated the socialist economic law of distribution according to work, but also damaged the principle of material interests, greatly weakened the enthusiasm of peasant labor, and directly affected the consolidation of collective farms. Therefore, collective farms gradually adopted distribution according to the quantity and quality of labor, and adopted a monetary wage system similar to that of state-owned enterprises. This method once played a certain role at that time, but it soon revealed that it was not suitable for the characteristic of collective farms where income could only be determined at the end of the year. Finally, the Party concentrated the wisdom of the masses and determined the only correct form of distribution based on workdays. For more than 20 years, the workday has been the basis for paying remuneration in collective farms.
    In addition, this book talks about the issue of agricultural technology transformation in many places. The author points out that agricultural technology transformation and agricultural collectivization are closely related. If the small private ownership of the relations of production is not replaced by socialist relations of production, technical transformation cannot be realized. Similarly, if the productive forces are not fundamentally changed, the backward state of agriculture cannot be completely eliminated. Therefore, without re-equipping agriculture with modern machinery technology, overall collectivization cannot be realized, and collective farms cannot be further developed. However, it should be pointed out that in the Soviet Union, collective farms were not organized after a large number of tractors had been prepared first, but the establishment of collective farms created good conditions for the use of modern agricultural machinery. The author cites many facts to illustrate that the simple merger and rational use of the original means of production of peasants, coupled with some technical improvements, can bring great benefits to production in this "handicraft workshop" period of collective farms. This stage occupies a very important position in the history of the Soviet collective farm movement and in the history of the agricultural technology revolution. This shows that first cooperation and then mechanization can also lead to complete agricultural cooperation. Of course, socialist agriculture cannot stay in this period for a long time. The technology of the "handicraft workshop" is not the material and technical basis of socialism. It is necessary to vigorously expand the production of tractors, agricultural machinery, trucks, chemical fertilizers, and electricity, and implement agricultural mechanization, electrification, and chemization. Only in this way can agricultural productivity be greatly improved and the superiority of collective farms can be further demonstrated.
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people, after a long period of arduous struggle, have transformed the scattered and backward small-scale peasant economy into the world's largest and most mechanized advanced socialist agriculture, and are striving to transition to communism.
    At present, China's rural areas are in a high tide of socialist transformation. This year, the semi-socialist cooperation of agriculture can be basically completed, and the transformation of agricultural cooperation from semi-socialism to complete socialism can be basically completed in another two or three years. With the arrival of the high tide of agricultural cooperation, a high tide of agricultural production will inevitably occur. For this reason, we should more earnestly learn from the Soviet Union's experience in building collective farms, run our agricultural producers' cooperatives well, and strive to thoroughly realize the socialist transformation of agriculture.

    介绍“苏联集体农庄制度的胜利”
    荣敬本
    最近人民出版社出版的苏联克拉耶夫著的“苏联集体农庄制度的胜利”一书，是一部比较有系统地叙述集体农庄建设的历史的著作，它在苏联获得很高的评价。
    过去，苏联虽然出版了不少关于集体农庄问题的书籍，但大多数只是谈到集体农庄建设中的个别阶段和个别问题。克拉耶夫写的这本书的主要优点，则是比较全面地、深刻地阐明了整个农业社会主义改造的基本理论问题和各个阶段的实践问题。在这本书里，作者不仅说明了马克思列宁主义关于农业社会主义改造问题的学说，彻底批判了资产阶级辩护士所谓的小农经济“稳固”和“土地报酬递减规律”等谬论，而且表明了集体农庄制度的优越性。
    这本书不同于同类性质的其他著作的地方，还在于它第一次收集了大量的实际材料，通过这些材料说明了苏联第一批国营农场和集体农庄建立的过程以及在全盘集体化以前时期的各种合作社建设的情况。事实上，最初的国营农场、集体农庄和合作社是很重要的，它们为农村中新的社会主义生产方式开辟了道路，积累了经验，创造了一切必要的条件。这些问题在过去其他著作中一般是谈得很少或者是轻描淡写的。
    这本书的另一个优点，就是它详细地叙述了苏联解决集体农庄建设中的各种复杂问题的曲折过程。通过这些事例，生动地介绍了苏联建设集体农庄的经验。
    在苏联，集体农庄大批建立起来以后，党就指出，集体农庄建设的主要任务，是从组织上和经济上把它加以巩固。而集体农庄巩固与否的最重要的标志，就是生产能否发展，劳动生产率能否提高。要达到这些目的，就必须大力发展公共经济，正确地组织劳动，贯彻合理的劳动报酬制度，不断地改进农业技术，等等。
    农民的生产资料合并起来以后，就形成集体农庄的公共财产。这也就是公共经济的起点。它的迅速增长，是集体农庄巩固的一个主要标志。为了满足农民个人的需要，除了这种主要的公共经济外，还允许庄员经营一定的副业，并握有宅旁小块园地。但重要的是在于必须把公共经济和个人经济正确地结合起来，必须首先保证在农庄中起决定性作用的公共经济的迅速增长。苏联集体农庄公共经济的增长，鲜明地表现在小农庄的合并上，这是集体农庄发展的必然要求。因为小农庄合并为大农庄以后，就更能发挥社会主义大农业的优越性，为进一步利用机器技术，为更好地使用土地和提高耕作业、畜牧业技艺，为开展多种经营，全面发展集体农庄，创造了有利的条件。
    由于集体化的结果，农民个人的分散的劳动变成了直接的社会劳动。因此，正确地组织和使用劳动也是很重要的。本书专门用一章的篇幅来论述集体农庄劳动组织和劳动报酬的问题。作者认为正确地组织和使用劳动，合理地分配劳动果实，对于集体农庄的巩固和发展都具有特别重要的意义。
    最初，苏联集体农庄在劳动组织上存在着平均主义倾向。大家轮流工作，今天喂马，明天耕田，甚至轮流担任主席，庄员每天要到管理委员会集合后，才知道今天干什么。因此，工作混乱，效率也很低。党和政府考虑并总结了先进集体农庄经验后，提出以固定生产队作为劳动组织的基本形式。这种生产队是常年固定的，它有固定的工作人员、固定的工作地区、固定的生产工具。人员编制按生产原则挑选配备，他们必须负责完成规定的任务。在1931年之后，生产队普遍地发展起来。生产队的建立和发展，迅速地解决了集体农民专业化的问题，消灭了无人负责现象，开展了社会主义竞赛，贯彻了按劳取酬的原则，从而大大提高了劳动生产率。当然，固定生产队这种基本形式并不排斥在执行各种农业工作时创造辅助劳动组织形式的可能性。在需要的时候，可以作必要的变动和临时的调整，建立如生产小组等这种辅助形式。
    除了劳动组织外，在成立了的集体农庄还存在着合理的劳动报酬问题。大家知道，今天苏联的集体农民所获得的劳动报酬，是按劳动日计算的。但是劳动日不是一下子就在集体农庄中普遍应用起来的。苏联在劳动报酬问题上也走过了一段曲折的道路。曾经有一个时期，集体农庄按人口、需要、土地或股份的多寡进行分配。这种反映着小资产阶级余毒和不适合社会主义利益的最不完善的方法和形式执行的结果，不但违反了按劳分配的社会主义经济规律，而且破坏了物质利益的原则，大大削弱了农民劳动的积极性，直接影响了集体农庄的巩固。因此，集体农庄逐渐采用按劳动数量和质量进行分配，采用类似国营企业的货币工资制。这种办法在当时曾经起了一定的作用，但很快就暴露出，它不适合于集体农庄中只有到年终才能确定收入的这一特点。最后，党集中了群众的智慧，确定了按劳动日进行分配这一唯一正确的形式。20多年来，劳动日一直是集体农庄中支付报酬的基础。
    此外，这本书在很多地方谈到农业技术改造的问题。作者指出，农业技术改造和农业集体化是密切联系着的。如果不用社会主义生产关系代替小私有的生产关系，就不能实现技术改造，同样地，如果不根本改变生产力，也就不能完全摆脱农业的落后状态。因此，不用现代化的机器技术重新装备农业，就不能实现全盘集体化，不能进一步发展集体农庄。但是，应该指出，在苏联，并不是先准备好了大批的拖拉机，然后再开始组织集体农庄的，而是集体农庄的建立给运用现代农业机器创造了良好的条件。作者列举许多事实说明，农民原有生产资料的简单合并和合理使用，再加上部分的技术改良，那末，这种“手工工场”时期的集体农庄，就能给生产带来极大的好处。这个阶段在苏联集体农庄运动史上、在农业技术革命史中占有很重要的地位。这说明，先合作化后机械化也同样可以走向完全的农业合作化的。当然，社会主义农业不能长久停留在这个时期。“手工工场”的技术并不是社会主义的物质技术基础。必须大力展开拖拉机、农业机器、载重汽车、化学肥料和电力的生产，实行农业机械化、电气化、化学化，只有这样才能大大提高农业生产力，进一步显示出集体农庄的优越性。
    在苏联共产党领导下，苏联人民经过长期的艰苦奋斗，已把分散落后的小农经济改造成为世界上规模最大、机械化程度最高的先进的社会主义农业，并且正在为过渡到共产主义而奋斗。
    目前，我国农村已处于社会主义改造的高潮，今年基本上可以完成农业的半社会主义的合作化，再过两三年就可以基本上完成农业合作化由半社会主义到完全社会主义的转变。随着农业合作化的高潮的到来，必然出现一个农业生产的高潮。为此，我们更应该认真学习苏联建设集体农庄的经验，把我们的农业生产合作社办好，为彻底实现农业的社会主义改造而奋斗。
