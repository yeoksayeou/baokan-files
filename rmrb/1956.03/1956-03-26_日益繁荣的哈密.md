    Increasingly Prosperous Hami
    Fan Chengqu
    With the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway extending westward, Hami, the first city encountered when entering Xinjiang from Gansu, is becoming increasingly important and prosperous.
    In this city, one can always see people wearing railway work clothes. Their appearance on the streets of Hami, and in the tents of railway and petroleum surveyors dotted across the Gobi Desert, invigorates the hearts of people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. It signifies that the high tide of industrial construction in the northwest border region of the motherland is not far off.
    As the railway approaches Xinjiang, Hami residents often turn to the topic of the rapid changes. They compare today with yesterday. In the past, it took six or seven days to travel from Lanzhou to Hami by car; today, with the train reaching Zhangye, the travel time by car has been shortened to four days, and it will be further shortened in the second half of this year. In the past, it took more than ten days for people in Hami to see newspapers from the capital; today, it only takes six or seven days. The airmail edition of the "People's Daily" can reach people in two or three days. In cinemas, people can also see the latest films quickly.
    Speaking of Hami, people always associate it with its specialty – Hami melons. Every autumn, large expanses of melon fields bear abundant and tempting sweet melons. Hospitable Uyghur farmers always invite visiting guests to taste the melons. If you spend three or four jiao, you can buy a melon weighing seven or eight jin. In 1955, Hami exported more than 80 tons of sweet melons, but it still far from meets the needs of all parts of the country. With the westward construction of the railway, Hami farmers are planning to expand melon fields, and the production troops here are also planning to plant more melons in 1957.
    Hami is located on the passage between Gansu and Xinjiang. In the dark years of the past, years of war left the land barren, and grain production was very low, and the people of all ethnic groups lived in poverty. From 1940 to the liberation in 1949, the county's cultivated land only expanded by about 5,000 mu, and annual grain production was not enough for nine months of consumption. In 1949, the county's yield per mu was only 146 jin, with a grain shortage of 11 million jin. The grain needed to be transported from afar from Urumqi, Aksu, and Jiuquan and Dunhuang in Gansu. People had to spend several times the price of grain on transportation, driving camels and carts to transport grain. After liberation, the Party and the People's Government led the people of all ethnic groups in carrying out land reform, resolving many water conservancy disputes, newly built 35 karez wells, and repaired 287 old karez wells. The area of cultivated land rapidly increased by more than 21,000 mu. In 1952, the county produced 38 million jin of grain, which not only fully supplied the county and the transit population, but also had a surplus of 4 million jin, completely reversing the historical grain shortage in Hami. In 1955, the county's average yield per mu reached more than 300 jin, with a total output of 40 million jin, double the amount in 1949. In order to welcome the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway to Hami, this winter and spring, the county will reclaim 22,000 mu of wasteland in order to produce more grain and cotton to meet the needs of national construction.
    Hami is inhabited by more than 52,000 people of Uyghur, Kazakh, Hui, Han, and other ethnic groups. Before liberation, due to the instigation of the Kuomintang bandits and the warlord Sheng Shicai, there was a deep divide between the people of all ethnic groups. After liberation, due to the correct implementation of ethnic policies, the emotional gap between the people of all ethnic groups gradually disappeared. Now, no matter which district or township, there are agricultural production cooperatives composed of two or three ethnic groups. Members of all ethnic groups respect each other's customs, work together, and are full of an atmosphere of ethnic unity and friendship. For example, the "Jianxin" agricultural production cooperative in the Huicheng District near Hami was initially composed of seven Uyghur households and two Hui households. Later, this cooperative saw that the nearby Han farmers lived a hard life. A year after its formation, it took the initiative to invite Han farmers to join. When Han farmers lacked seeds and food, Uyghur and Hui farmers found ways to solve the problems. Han farmers also helped Uyghur farmers with farming techniques. There are many similar examples of unity and friendship in other ethnic joint cooperatives.
    With the westward construction of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, the people of all ethnic groups in Hami are confidently welcoming a beautiful tomorrow with practical actions.

    日益繁荣的哈密
    范成渠
    随着兰新铁路向西伸展，哈密，从甘肃进入新疆所遇到的第一座城市，它的地位一天一天地显得重要，也一天一天地繁荣起来。
    人们在这座城市里，总可以看到那些穿着铁路工作服装的人。他们出现在哈密街头，以及在戈壁滩上点缀着的铁路和石油勘测人员的帐篷，振奋着新疆各族人民的心。这意味着祖国的西北边疆工业建设的高潮已经为期不远了。
    在铁路临近新疆的前夕，哈密居民的话题往往转到一日千里的变化上。他们对比着今天和昨天。过去，从兰州到哈密，坐汽车要六、七天；今天，火车通到张掖，坐汽车的时间缩短到四天，到今年下半年，时间又将缩短了；过去，人们在哈密要十多天才能看到首都的报纸；今天，只要六、七天了。航空版的“人民日报”，两、三天内就可以传到人们的手中。在电影院里，人们也可以很快地看到最新的影片。
    提起哈密，人们总会连想到这里的特产——哈密瓜。每到秋天，大片大片的瓜田，结着丰硕诱人的甜瓜，殷勤好客的维吾尔族农民，总要请来访的客人，尝一尝瓜的味道。如果你花上三、四角钱，就可以买一个七、八斤重的瓜。哈密在1955年输出了八十多吨甜瓜，但是还远不能满足全国各地的需要。随着铁路的向西修筑，哈密的农民正计划扩大瓜田，而这里的生产部队，也计划在1957年种更多的瓜。
    哈密，地当甘肃、新疆来往的孔道。在过去黑暗的岁月里，兵燹连年，土地荒芜，粮食产量很低，各族人民过着贫困的生活。从1940年到临解放的1949年，全县耕地只扩大五千亩左右，每年生产粮食不足九个月食用。1949年，全县耕地每亩产量仅146市斤，缺粮一千一百万斤，所缺粮食要远从乌鲁木齐、阿克苏和甘肃的酒泉、敦煌等地运来，人们不得不花比粮食贵几倍的运费，赶着骆驼、大车去运粮食。解放后，党和人民政府领导各族人民进行了土地改革，解决了许多水利纠纷，新修了35道坎儿井，修复287道旧坎儿井，耕地面积迅速地增加了二万一千多亩。1952年全县共产粮食三千八百万市斤，不但能充分供应全县及过境人口食用，并且有余粮四百万斤，完全扭转了哈密历史上一直缺粮的情况。1955年，全县单位面积产量每亩平均达到三百多斤，总产量达四千万斤，比1949年增加了一倍。为了迎接兰新铁路修到哈密，去冬今春，全县要开垦出荒地二万二千亩，以便生产出更多的粮食和棉花，适应国家建设的需要。
    哈密，居住着维吾尔、哈萨克、回、汉等族人民五万二千多人。在解放前，由于国民党匪帮和盛匪世才的挑拨离间，各族人民之间有很深的隔阂；解放后，由于民族政策的正确执行，各族人民感情上的鸿沟逐渐消除。现在不论哪个区、哪个乡，都有两、三个民族组成的农业生产合作社，各民族的社员互相尊重风俗习惯，共同劳动，充满了民族团结友爱的气氛。像哈密近郊回城区的“建新”农业生产合作社，最先是由七户维吾尔族和二户回族农民组成的。以后这个社看到附近的汉族农民生活苦，在组成一年以后，便主动地邀请汉族农民加入。汉族农民缺乏种籽和食粮，维、回族农民便想办法来解决。汉族农民也在耕作技术上来帮助维族农民。其他的民族联合社里，也有很多类似这样团结友爱的事例。
    随着兰新铁路向西修筑，哈密各族人民正信心百倍地用实际行动来迎接美丽的明天。
