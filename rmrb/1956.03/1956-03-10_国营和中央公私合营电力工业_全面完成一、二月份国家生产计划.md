The national state-owned and centrally administered joint state-private electric power industrial system comprehensively overfulfilled the national production plan for January and February of this year. In terms of power generation alone, over 43 million more kilowatt-hours of electricity were produced than planned by the state. If this electricity were used as power for industrial production, it could produce over 50,000 more tons of steel or weave over 8 million more bolts of cloth.

During the first two months of this year, the electric power systems in various regions also overfulfilled the state plan in terms of major economic indicators such as reducing coal consumption and saving on plant power consumption and line losses. In February, power plants in various regions saved 5.3 million kilowatt-hours of electricity compared to the state plan by adopting economic dispatching and rationally using machinery and other measures. At the same time, due to reduced coal consumption, thermal power plants across the country also saved the state over 8,000 tons of coal in January and February. (Xinhua News Agency)

    国营和中央公私合营电力工业
    全面完成一、二月份国家生产计划
    全国国营和中央管理的公私合营的电力工业系统，今年1月和2月份全面超额完成了国家生产计划。其中只是发电量一项，就比国家计划多生产了4，300多万度电。这些电如果用来做工业生产的动力，可以多炼5万多吨钢，或多织800多万匹布。
    各地电力系统今年头两个月内，在降低煤耗和节省厂用电、线路损失等主要经济指标方面，也超额完成了国家计划。2月份各地电厂由于采用经济调度，合理地使用机器等措施，比国家计划节省了530万度电力。同时由于煤耗降低，全国火力发电厂1月和2月还为国家节省了8，000多吨燃煤。    （新华社）
