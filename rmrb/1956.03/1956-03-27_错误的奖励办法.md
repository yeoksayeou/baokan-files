    Wrong Reward Method
    In February, the Baotou Grease Company held an award ceremony. In addition to the eighteen comrades and two units that were rated as models receiving prizes, all employees also received a fountain pen, a diary, and an enamel mug each. Staff members above the section chief level, although not participating in the evaluation, received even more prizes: a fountain pen, a diary, a pigskin handbag, and a thermos with an iron shell each.
    The reason for this reward method is: In 1955, the company overfulfilled its tasks, and every employee worked hard, so everyone should be rewarded. This reason is obviously untenable, because this kind of method of issuing "awards" to everyone regardless of advanced or backward status, based on "rank," cannot achieve the purpose of rewarding the advanced and promoting the backward. Therefore, it is completely inconsistent with the national reward policy! All enterprises should not adopt this method.

    错误的奖励办法
    二月间，包头油脂公司举行了一次发奖大会。除了被评为模范的十八位同志和两个单位得到奖品外，所有职工每人也得到一支自来水笔、一本日记本、一个搪瓷杯。股长以上的工作人员虽然没参加评比，可是得到的奖品更多：每人自来水笔、日记本、猪皮手提包、铁壳暖壶各一件。
    这种奖励办法的理由是：1955年公司超额完成了任务，每位职工都辛苦了，因此都应该得奖。这种理由显然是难以成立的，因为像这种不分先进、落后，看“级别”一律发“奖”的办法，是不能达到奖励先进、推动落后的目的。因此，它是完全不符合国家奖励政策的！一切企业都不应该采取这种办法。
