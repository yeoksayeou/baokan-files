Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, according to TASS: Danish Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hansen held a press conference at the Danish Embassy in Moscow on the evening of March 6.

Hansen said in a statement that resuming negotiations on a new two-year trade agreement between Denmark and the Soviet Union is of great significance to the relationship between the two countries.

Hansen then pointed out that the talks were conducted in a very frank atmosphere. The Soviet participants in the talks expressed their willingness to study many issues raised by the Danish side, I am referring to issues concerning the return of Danish citizens, Baltic Sea rescue matters, cultural issues, and compensation issues, although no promises were made on the latter issue. Both sides agreed that the appropriate authorities of the two countries should further discuss this issue.

He said: I would like to simply say that, for me personally, and as far as I know for the Danish Minister of Education, this visit has been very valuable so far. I am convinced that this visit will only promote the good relations between our two countries.

    汉森在莫斯科的谈话
    新华社据塔斯社莫斯科讯  丹麦首相兼外交大臣汉森3月6日晚间，在莫斯科的丹麦驻苏联大使馆举行了记者招待会。
    汉森发表谈话说，恢复关于丹麦和苏联之间关于新的两年换货议定书的谈判，对丹麦和苏联两国的关系有很重要的意义。
    汉森接着指出，会谈是在很坦率的气氛中进行的。苏联方面参加会谈的人表示愿意研究丹麦方面提出的许多问题，我指的是关于丹麦公民回国和波罗的海救生事务的问题、文化问题以及赔偿问题，虽然在后一问题上没有许下任何诺言。双方同意由两国适当的当局进一步讨论这一问题。
    他说：我愿意简单地说，对我个人以及据我所知对丹麦教育大臣来说，到现在为止这次访问是非常有价值的。我深信，这次访问只会促进我们两国的良好关系。
