    New-style Double-Wheel Two-Furrow Plow Successfully Trial-Produced
    The local state-owned Kaifeng Machinery Factory in Henan Province successfully trial-produced the 2LY-120 medium-sized double-wheel two-furrow plow more than a month ahead of schedule. The specifications and quality of this double-furrow plow fully meet the standards approved by the state. The Kaifeng Machinery Factory has decided to start mass production in late March.
    The main advantage of this new type of double-wheel two-furrow plow is that the distance between the two furrow wheels can be flexibly adjusted as needed, and one or two plowshares can be installed as required. Manufacturing this plow can also save steel and reduce costs. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
