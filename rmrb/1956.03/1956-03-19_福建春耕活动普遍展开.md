Xinhua News Agency dispatch:
　　Spring ploughing activities in the rural areas of Fujian Province have been unfolding from south to north and are becoming increasingly busy. Farmers in the southern Longxi and Jinjiang Special Districts have already completed the sowing of early rice and are currently sowing spring peanuts and spring soybeans. Farmers in the northern Jianyang, Nanping, and Yong'an Special Districts are soaking seeds, sowing, and improving soil, preparing to expand the replanting area by more than 1 million mu. The province's early rice planting area is expected to increase by 2 million mu compared to last year. As of early March, the water conservancy projects completed throughout the province can eliminate the threat of drought for an area of farmland more than double that of the entire last year. The amount of fertilizer accumulated has increased by more than half compared to the same period last year. The area of improved varieties of rice that have been sown or are being prepared for sowing accounts for about 80% of the total rice planting area, and more than 700,000 mu of soil has been improved.

    福建春耕活动普遍展开
    福建省农村的春耕活动已经从南而北，愈来愈繁忙了。南部龙溪、晋江等专区农民已经完成早稻播种，目前正在播种春花生、春大豆。北部建阳、南平和永安等专区农民正在浸种、播种和改良土壤，准备扩大复种面积100多万亩。全省早稻种植面积预计将比去年增加200万亩。到3月上旬为止，全省已经完工的水利工程可以消灭旱灾威胁的农田面积比去年全年增加一倍多，积肥量比去年同期增加半倍以上，已经播种和准备播种的水稻良种面积占全部水稻种植面积的80％左右，已经改良土壤70多万亩。
