Railway science workers have completed 28 railway science papers after more than a year of research by teachers from the Beijing Railway Institute, the Railway Science Research Institute, and on-site railway workers. This batch of papers was presented at the first scientific discussion meeting of the Beijing Railway Institute, held from February 19th to 24th.

The meeting divided into three groups—transportation, economics, and telecommunications signals—to carefully discuss these papers and gave them high praise. The meeting believed that the 11 papers on railway transportation could improve teaching quality and enrich teaching content, and decided to recommend 6 of them to the Ministry of Railways for adoption and application. The 7 papers on railway economics were decided to be submitted to relevant departments for adoption or reference. The 4 papers on railway telecommunications signals could also be provided to railway sites for adoption and application. The meeting specifically pointed out that Professor Jin Shixuan's "On the Adjustment of Daily Heavy Traffic Flow on China's Railways," Professor Lin Damei's "On the Calculation Method of Improving the Compilation Plan of Single-Group Technical Through Trains," Zhu Songnian, an engineer from the Planning Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, "Research on the Optimal Scheme Selection of Train Formation Plans for the Entire Railway," and Gao Jiaju, a Deputy Doctor studying in the Soviet Union who is currently interning at the Sujiatun Station, "The Impact of Passenger Trains on the Throughput Capacity and Travel Speed of Freight Trains on Single-Track Sections," should be studied and revised according to the opinions put forward by everyone, and their application in practical work on the site will improve railway transportation efficiency.

This meeting showed that schools, scientific research institutions, and the site should and can contact and cooperate with each other. For example, among the papers this time, Associate Professor Huang Hongjia's "Research on the Electromagnetic System of Searchlight Color Light Signals" and Associate Professor She Shou Xian's "Research on the Optical System of Searchlight Color Light Signals" were the result of cooperation with the Railway Science Research Institute. The meeting also showed that carrying out scientific research work and improving teaching quality can proceed simultaneously and can be combined with each other.

The meeting proposed that, in order to expand the scientific research team of the Beijing Railway Institute, it is initially planned to train 15 to 20 doctors and 150 to 200 associate doctors within 12 years.

    铁道科学工作者写出一批科学论文
    北京铁道学院教师、铁道科学研究院和铁道现场的工作人员经过一年多的研究，完成了28篇铁道科学论文。这批论文在2月19日到24日召开的北京铁道学院第一次科学讨论会上提出。
    会议分运输、经济和电信信号三组分别认真地讨论了这批论文，并给予很高的评价。铁道运输方面的11篇论文，会议认为都能提高教学质量、充实教学内容，其中6篇决定推荐给铁道部采纳应用。铁道经济方面的7篇论文决定提请有关部门采纳或参考。铁道电信信号方面的4篇论文也可以提供铁道现场采纳应用。会议特别指出，金士宣教授的“有关我国铁路日常重车流调整问题”，林达美教授的“有关改善单组技术直达列车编组计划的计算方法问题”，铁道部计划局工程师朱松年的“全路列车编组计划最优方案选择之研究”以及现在苏家屯车站实习的留苏副博士高家驹的“单线区段上旅客列车对货物列车通过能力和旅行速度的影响”等论文，根据大家所提意见，进行研究修改以后，在现场实际工作中应用，将使铁路运输效率得到提高。
    这次会议表明，学校、科学研究机关、现场三者之间应该而且可以互相联系和合作。如这次的论文中，黄宏嘉副教授的“探照式色灯信号机电磁系统的研究”和佘守宪副教授的“探照式色灯信号机光学系统的研究”等篇，就是同铁道科学研究院合作得到的结果。会议还表明，开展科学研究工作和提高教学质量可以同时并进，并且可以互相结合起来。
    会议提出，为了扩大北京铁道学院科学研究的队伍，初步规划在12年内培养出15到20个博士，150到200个副博士。
