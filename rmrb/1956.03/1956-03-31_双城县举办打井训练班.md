In Shuangcheng County, Heilongjiang Province, the well-drilling movement initially faced challenges due to a lack of technical personnel, leading to frequent issues such as improper site selection and insufficient quality control, which hindered the rapid development of the movement. To address this problem, county and district leadership, while organizing visits and using facts to overcome the cadres' and the masses' fear of difficulty and conservative thinking, held well-drilling training classes and specialized technical seminars. They fully explored and organized the small number of well diggers in the countryside to impart their skills. They universally adopted methods such as "step-by-step training, division of labor and contracting, practical operation, and on-the-spot training," cultivating a large number of well-drilling technical personnel. For example, in the Handian District, using this method quickly transformed the original few well diggers into more than 180 well diggers. According to statistics from early March, the county's well-drilling plan before spring plowing had increased from 1,200 wells to 2,614 wells, and the well-drilling movement had entered a high tide.

    双城县举办打井训练班
    黑龙江省双城县的打井运动，开始由于缺乏技术人材，不断发生位置选择不当、不注意质量等现象，影响了运动的迅速开展。为了解决这个问题，县区领导机关在组织参观，用事实打破干部和群众的怕困难和保守思想的同时，举办了打井训练班和专门技术座谈会，把蕴藏在农村中的少数井匠充分发掘和组织起来传授技术，普遍采用“逐级训练，分工包干，实际操作，就地培养”等方法，培养了大批打井技术人材，如韩甸区采用这种办法，全区很快就由原来的几个井匠培养出一百八十多个井匠。据三月上旬统计，全县春耕前的打井计划已由1，200眼增长到2，614眼，打井运动进入了高潮。（本报驻哈尔滨记者）
