    A Mother's Accusation
    By our reporter Ji Yin
    In a small building at No. 8, Shimen 1st Road, Da Zhong Lane, Shanghai, lives a 56-year-old woman named Wu Zhiyu. This old woman recently wrote a sorrowful appeal to the "People's Daily," requesting that the government seek justice for her. It turns out that this kind old woman encountered a tragic misfortune in 1952: her only beloved son, Bao Zhe'en, suffered all kinds of persecution at the University of Florida in the United States because he wanted to return to his motherland, and eventually died inexplicably. In her letter, Wu Zhiyu asked the government to question the American government on her behalf, demanding that the American government be held responsible for the suspicious death of her beloved son.
    Recently, the reporter visited Wu Zhiyu, and she described to the reporter in detail the process of her son being persecuted to death. She said: "My only son, Bao Zhe'en, was a healthy and intelligent young man. He graduated from the Civil Engineering Department of St. John's University in Shanghai in 1946 with excellent grades. In order to enable him to continue his studies, my son and I tried every means to put together one thousand US dollars and went to the United States to study in January 1948, continuing to study in the Civil Engineering Department at the University of Florida (his name at the school was DANIEL T.E. BAU). At school, he worked and studied at the same time, doing some work at the school while studying. He wrote to me and told me that he would be able to graduate in 1949. At the beginning of 1949, the Chinese People's Liberation Army victoriously crossed the Yangtze River to the south of the Yangtze River, the evil Kuomintang government collapsed, and Shanghai was liberated in May of the same year. Zhe'en was looking forward to the day he would return to China, but as the semester approached, the school suddenly notified him that his courses had not been completed, and he could not return to China and must extend it for another year. At that time, my son was very sad and wrote me a letter, the general idea of ​​which was: Mom, I can't come back this year. I could have graduated this year, but the school insisted that I hadn't finished my courses and forced me to study for another year... How much I miss you! My son has always had the best grades at school. After arriving at the University of Florida in the United States, he wrote to me and told me that his grades were still very good. What reason did the University of Florida have to extend his semester and not let him return to China?"
    "My son finally graduated in 1950," Wu said again, "He got a master's degree and sent me a photo taken after graduation (which I still keep). That year, he applied to the local American government to return to China, but it was not approved. As a result, he was forced to stay and teach at the school, while continuing to apply to return to China."
    "I eagerly hoped that he could return to China as soon as possible, so that my son and I could be reunited, and so that his skills could contribute to the country's construction work. In my letters to him, I often told him about the large-scale construction projects being carried out in China. Sometimes I would cut out articles from the newspaper introducing construction projects and send them to him, encouraging him to come back soon. He was very excited about the news I told him and was even more eager to return to China. He wrote to me and said that he told these news to his familiar classmates, and everyone told each other. Sometimes as soon as my letter arrived, everyone rushed over to read it... But his application to return to China was rejected by the U.S. government's Immigration Bureau. At this time, he hinted in a letter that his actions had attracted the attention of the local U.S. government. After that, the envelopes of the letters he wrote often did not include the address of where they were sent from. He was obviously afraid that the letters would be discovered during inspection and thus suffer greater persecution. These ominous signs made me even more worried about my son's safety."
    "In May 1952, misfortune really happened. Zhe'en sent a very strange letter, which said: 'According to the doctor's examination, a subtle (bacteria) lung disease was found... I am forced to go to a sanatorium for recuperation. It is very likely that the Immigration Bureau has restrictions on Chinese professors, perhaps under surveillance. It is questionable whether there will be communication in the future. Remittances are also a problem, and even life is a problem. The matter is abrupt and I cannot avoid it. Perhaps changes in the international situation are also a big problem – I have had sleepless nights... My heart is very painful, what to do, what to do, I only hope that God will bless you and me, until we meet again...' The end of the letter also said: 'Is the subtle (bacteria) lung disease issue also...?'"
    "This letter was written very short and chaotic. In the past, he used to write to me in English, but this time he wrote in Chinese. The envelope did not have a return address. It is conceivable how nervous and frightened he was when he wrote this letter. After receiving this letter, I was really worried. My son has always been very healthy. There was no lung disease at all when he went abroad for a physical examination. Moreover, he had never mentioned having lung disease in any of his previous letters."
    "I waited day and night for my son's next letter, but a month passed, two months passed, and still no letter came. Unexpectedly, that letter was my son's last letter. One day, the postman delivered a letter from a lawyer named E.A. CLAYTON. He simply notified me that my son had died, and said nothing else. I fainted after reading the letter. Later, my neighbors woke me up. I was very sad and tried my best to write a letter to the president of the University of Florida, asking him to tell me in detail how my son died, how his belongings were handled, and asking them to be responsible for sending back to me the souvenirs I gave to my son. I waited for a reply every day, but after more than two months, the president did not reply to me. The same lawyer sent an ordinary letter on September 17, 1952, saying: In order to arrange for the funeral expenses, all of my son's belongings had been sold. He promised to send back some souvenirs that were left behind, but he never did. This letter did not mention at all how my son died."
    Wu said, "The death of my beloved son made me so sad that I simply didn't have the courage to live anymore. I often cried all day long. Excessive grief damaged my health and caused severe insomnia. I was often sick in bed. But then I thought, I haven't figured out how my son died yet, I can't be so weak, I must be strong."
    Now she reads the newspaper every day and is most concerned about the news of the Sino-American Geneva talks. She said: "The American government has repeatedly said that they do not obstruct our students from returning to China, but my son's experience shows that this is nothing but a complete lie. The Geneva talks are still going on. I want to accuse the American government of why they didn't let my son return to China? Why did they repeatedly persecute my innocent beloved son to die unclearly in the United States? I ask the government to forward my accusation to the American government, and they must be held responsible for my son's wrongful death and give an explanation!" (Attached picture)

    母亲的控诉
    本报记者　季音
    在上海石门一路大中里八号的一间小楼上，住着一位年已五十六岁的吴志豫老太太。这位老人最近向“人民日报”写了一封悲痛的呼吁信，要求转请政府替她伸冤作主。原来这位慈祥的老妇人在1952年遭遇了惨痛的不幸：她唯一的爱子鲍哲恩因为要返回祖国，在美国佛罗里达大学遭受了种种的迫害，最后竟不明不白地死去了。吴志豫老太太在信中要求政府，代她向美国政府提出责问，要美国政府对她爱子可疑的死亡作出负责的交代。
    最近，记者访问了吴志豫老太太，她向记者详细叙述了她儿子被害死去的经过。她说：“我的独子鲍哲恩是一个身体健康、天资聪慧的青年人，1946年在上海圣约翰大学土木工程系毕业，成绩很好。为了使他能够继续学习深造，我们母子两人想尽办法凑起了一千元美金，在1948年1月到美国去留学，进佛罗里达大学继续念土木工程系（他在学校的名字是DANIELT．E．BAU）在学校里，他是半工半读的，一边在校做些事，一边念书。他来信告诉我，1949年他就可以念完毕业。到了1949年初，中国人民解放军胜利地横渡长江到了江南一带，万恶的国民党政府垮台了，上海也在同年的五月解放了，哲恩一心等着回国的日子，但当学期临近时，学校里突然通知他说：他的课程还没有念完，不能回国，必须延长一年。当时我的儿子很难过，曾写了一封信告诉我，信上的大意是说：妈妈，今年我不能回来了，本来今年我可以毕业了，学校里硬说我课程没有读完，强要我再读一年……我是多么想念你们呵！我的儿子在学校成绩一向是最好的，到美国佛罗里达大学后，他来信告诉我，他的成绩仍然很好，佛罗里达大学有什么理由一定要延长他的学期，不让他回国呢？”
    “1950年我的儿子终于毕业了，”吴老太太又说，“他得到了硕士学位，还把毕业后拍的照片寄给了我（现在我仍保存着它）。那年，他向当地美国政府提出了回国申请，但没有被批准，结果，他又被迫留了下来，在学校里教书，一面继续申请回国。”
    “我迫切地希望他能早日回国，好让我们母子团聚，也好让他的技术能够贡献给国家的建设工作。在我给他的信中，我经常把国内进行大规模建设的消息告诉他。有时候还把报上介绍建设工程的文章剪下来寄给他，鼓励他快回来。他对我告诉他的这些消息，非常兴奋，更急于要回国来。他来信说，他把这些消息告诉了他熟悉的同学，大家都相互传告。有时候我的信一到，大家就赶拢来抢着读……但是他的回国申请遭到了美国政府移民局的拒绝，这时候他曾来信暗示说：他的行动已经引起了当地美国政府的注意。这以后，他写来的信，信封上就经常没有写出寄信的地点。他显然是害怕信件在检查中被发现，因而遭到更大的迫害。这些不吉利的迹象，使我更加为儿子的安全而耽忧。”
    “1952年5月，不幸果然发生了。哲恩寄来了一封很奇怪的信，信中说：‘由医生查察，发现有肺病细微（菌）……迫赴疗养院休养，很可能移民局对于中国教授，有所限制，也许属于监视，今后通讯能否，尚成问题，汇款亦生问题，即生命亦生问题，事出唐突，男无法避免，大概国际时局变迁，亦其中——大问题，男坐（失）眠数夜……心中殊痛苦，奈何奈何，但愿上苍保佑你我，后会有期……。’信末又说：‘即肺病细微（菌）一题，亦是？’。”
    “这封信写得很短很乱。过去他给我写信常用英文，这次写的是中文，信封上也没有发信地址，可以想像他写这封信的时候，心情是多么紧张和惊悸。我接到这封信后，真是忧心如焚。我的儿子身体一向是很健康的。出国检查身体时根本没有什么肺病。而且从他的历次来信中，也从没有提到过生肺病的情形。”
    “我日夜等着儿子的下一封来信，但一个月过去了，两个月过去了，仍没有信来。想不到那封信竟是我儿子的最后一封信。有一天，邮差送来一封信，是一个叫克勒顿（E·A·CLAYTON）的律师寄来的。他简单地通知我说：我的儿子已经死了，除此之外什么也没有说。我读完信就昏倒了。后来邻居们把我救醒过来，我悲伤万分，勉力写了封信给佛罗里达大学的校长，要他详细告诉我儿子是怎样死的，他的遗物怎样处理，并且要他们负责把我给儿子的纪念物寄还我。我天天盼望着回信，一直过了两个多月，那位校长没有给我回信，仍由那个律师在1952年9月17日寄来了一封普通平信，信里说：为了安排葬殓费，我儿子的遗物已全部变卖了。留下的一些纪念物，他答应寄还给我，可是后来并没有寄来。这封信对我儿子究竟怎样死的根本避而不谈。”
    吴老太太说：“爱子的死去，曾使我悲痛得简直没有勇气再生活下去，我时常整日哭泣，过度的哀痛使得健康受到了摧残，患了严重的失眠症，时常病倒床上。但后来我想，我儿子怎样死的，还没有弄清楚，我不能这样软弱，我要坚强起来。”
    她现在每天都要读报，最关心的是中美日内瓦谈判的消息，她说：“美国政府口口声声说他们并不阻挠我国的留学生回国，但是从我儿子的遭遇中就说明了这不过是彻头彻尾的谎话。现在日内瓦谈判还在进行，我要控诉美国政府为什么不让我的儿子回国？为什么一再迫害我无罪的爱子不明不白的死在美国？我要求政府将我的控诉转给美国政府，一定要他们对我儿子的冤死负责作出交代！”（附图片）
