Comrades! The time since our Party's 19th Congress has been relatively short. However, during this period, some significant political and economic measures have been implemented in our country, strengthening the power of the Soviet state, enhancing its international prestige, consolidating the alliance between the working class and the peasantry, and creating conditions for a new and powerful surge in all sectors of the socialist economy.

Based on the economic strength the country has gained from the successful completion of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the Party has set new tasks for the people, the realization of which will enable us to make great progress on the road to communist construction.

The reports by Comrade N.S. Khrushchev and Comrade N.A. Bulganin, as well as the draft directives of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party regarding the Sixth Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union, which were published for nationwide review and discussion, illustrate these tasks.

The broad plans for the future work of our Party and all the Soviet people, as elaborated in the reports by Khrushchev and Bulganin, have been unanimously endorsed. This demonstrates the general conviction that this program is correct and realistic, and that the issues of great principle significance raised in Comrade N.S. Khrushchev's report—the coexistence of the socialist and capitalist economic systems, the possibility of preventing war in the present era, and the paths of transition to socialism in different countries—are correct and timely.

The Central Committee's creative study of these most significant issues of Marxist-Leninist theory provides our Party and the communist parties of other countries with correct direction in their practical work, enabling them to assess the concrete situations and historical conditions that have taken shape in social development.

The draft directives submitted to this Congress for review stipulate a further comprehensive development of the national economy on the basis of the priority growth of heavy industry, a rapid development of agricultural production, and a significant improvement in the material welfare and cultural living standards of the Soviet people. Particular emphasis is placed on the necessity of accelerating technological progress and increasing social labor productivity, as this is the most important condition for the continuous and rapid growth of the socialist economy.

The pace of national economic development stipulated in the draft directives, and the scope and scale of production growth in all sectors of the national economy, will ensure that we can make great progress in resolving the basic economic task of the Soviet Union, which is to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in economic terms, that is, in terms of output per capita.

We now possess all the necessary conditions and possibilities to resolve this task within a relatively short historical period.

In the 13 years before the war, we transformed our country from a previously backward nation into an advanced nation, from an agricultural country into an industrial power.

However, if you compare the absolute figures of industrial production growth in the pre-war Five-Year Plans with the tasks of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, you will see that the pace of economic development in the Sixth Five-Year Plan will far exceed that of the pre-war Five-Year Plans. During all the pre-war Five-Year Plans, pig iron production only increased by more than 11 million tons, while in the five years of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, it will increase by approximately 20 million tons. During the pre-war Five-Year Plans, the Soviet Union's steel production only increased by 14 million tons, while during the Sixth Five-Year Plan, steel production will increase by 23 million tons. During the pre-war Five-Year Plans, coal production only increased by 130 million tons, while during the Sixth Five-Year Plan, coal production will increase by 202 million tons. Finally, during the pre-war Five-Year Plans, oil production only increased by more than 19 million tons, while during the Sixth Five-Year Plan, oil production will increase by 64 million tons.

Of course, we have not yet caught up with the United States in terms of industrial output per capita, and we have not yet surpassed the United States in terms of total industrial output. However, our rate of development exceeds the rate of development of American industry by many times, which makes it possible for us to overcome this backwardness in the shortest historical period. All the experience of peaceful economic construction proves that the Soviet Union can successfully resolve its main economic tasks. We have no doubt that if no one interferes with us, we will soon be able to solve this task. What hinders us first and foremost is war. The Soviet Union has existed for 38 years, and during this period, we have spent approximately 18 years on wars imposed on us and on restoring the economy destroyed by these wars.

As everyone knows, the Second World War delayed our country's industrial development by approximately two Five-Year Plans. Statistical data show that if the Soviet Union's peaceful economic construction had not been interrupted by this war, according to the production growth rate we achieved in the post-war and recovery periods, Soviet industry could have produced approximately 75 million tons of steel, 560 million tons of coal, 125 million tons of oil, 250 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, and 40 million tons of cement in 1955. Under these circumstances, according to the development rate stipulated in the draft directives of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, we would certainly be able to catch up with the modern production level of the United States in terms of total industrial output, and even surpass this level in some of the most important products.

In our economic competition with the capitalist system, a particularly important factor is that the absolute increase in the most important industrial products in the Soviet Union's heavy industry is also beginning to exceed that of the major capitalist countries.

For example, in the last five years, the United States' pig iron production only increased by 10.6 million tons, the three Western European countries (Britain, France, and West Germany) combined increased by 13 million tons, while the Soviet Union increased by 14 million tons.

In the last five years, the United States' steel production increased by 17 million tons, the above-mentioned three Western European countries combined increased by 16.7 million tons, while the Soviet Union increased by nearly 18 million tons.

At the same time, it is important to point out that the socialist economy (whose main driving force and ultimate goal is to maximize the satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society) is peaceful in essence and nature. We do not need war to victoriously complete the great tasks of socialist construction. Our economy, both in the past and now, has been developing rapidly in peacetime, while the US economy has largely relied on war for its development, even more so since the wars the US participated in this century have all been fought outside its territory.

Comrades, this is not propaganda; it is an undeniable historical fact. Let us compare the development indicators of our industry and American industry in wartime and peacetime! During the period of pre-war peaceful economic construction (1927 to 1940), the Soviet Union's industrial output increased by 18.6% annually, while the United States' industry only increased by 2%. During the Second World War, due to the immense destruction caused by the war, Soviet industry was unable to increase its output. In 1945, its output only reached 92% of the 1940 level, while the United States' industrial output increased by 60% during this period. After the end of the war, a period of peaceful construction began, and our industry once again experienced rapid development. From 1948 to 1955, the Soviet Union's industrial output increased by 16.6% annually, while the United States' industry only increased by 4.1%.

In this light, isn't it obvious that the socialist world does not need war, that war only benefits capitalist monopolies, and that the imperialist blocs of the United States and Britain now view the militarization of the economy as the only means to avoid crises and maintain existing levels of industrial production?

Isn't it obvious that the claim, prevalent in certain groups in the United States, Britain, and other countries, that the threat of war comes from the Soviet Union is nonsense and slander?

What could be more convincing than this to demonstrate that the interests of socialism and capitalism are directly opposed? Indeed, based on these materials, we can confidently say that aggressive war is incompatible with our intentions, our goals, and our tasks, and is completely hostile to them, because aggressive war hinders our progress in the peaceful economic competition with capitalism and hinders our progress in the construction of a communist society.

Comrades! The draft directives on the Sixth Five-Year Plan submitted to the 20th Congress for review by our Party's Central Committee are based on the achievements of peaceful economic construction during the post-war period and also anticipate peaceful development conditions in the future.

The Soviet people support and unanimously endorse the draft directives on the Sixth Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. Our general task, which is the task of all Party organizations, Soviet organs, economic organizations, trade union organizations, and youth league organizations, is to assist all enterprises, construction units, collective farms, and state farms in successfully completing the Five-Year Plan in all aspects of socialist construction. In order to victoriously resolve this task, we must accelerate technological progress, ensure a further significant increase in labor productivity, conscientiously improve the level of economic leadership, and improve the level of production planning and production management.

It would be wrong to think that the superiority of the socialist economic system can itself guarantee the victorious completion of our plan. Experience has proven that it is impossible to victoriously complete the plan without maximizing the mobilization of all forces and without constantly improving our entire organizational and economic work.

The Party's Central Committee and the government have recently taken a series of measures to improve our entire economic leadership work—including improving planning work. I would like to talk about some issues related to planning work and about the shortcomings in this area and the ways to overcome these shortcomings.

First, I would like to report to the Congress on the measures taken to improve the planning of the national economy.

The socialist economy, by its nature, is a planned economy. It is incompatible with the spontaneous laws of capitalist economic development, which inevitably involve leaps and declines, crises, and shocks. However, it cannot be concluded from this that, under any circumstances, difficulties, inconsistencies, and imbalances cannot arise in the development of our national economy.

The objective laws of socialist production development do not operate automatically. Only by comprehensively studying the requirements of these laws and correctly considering them in our plans can we prevent inconsistencies and imbalances in the national economy, thereby ensuring the rapid development of all sectors of the national economy.

In this regard, much depends on the national planning agencies, which, when formulating and checking the implementation of plans, must ensure the planned and proportional development of all sectors of the national economy in the plans. From the implementation of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, we can see how important this is. The summary of the implementation of the Fifth Five-Year Plan shows that if the above-mentioned requirements had been fully ensured in the formulation and implementation of the plan, our economic construction would have achieved even greater success in the previous Five-Year Plan. I only need to give one example to prove this. From the second half of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, it became apparent that the development of the coal industry was lagging behind the increasingly rapid growth needs of the national economy. The industrial fuel sector in the European part of the Soviet Union encountered difficulties due to a lack of fuel.

Thanks to the effective measures taken by the CPSU Central Committee and the government, coal production has been greatly increased at the end of the Five-Year Plan, thus ensuring the current fuel needs of the national economy as a whole. If sufficient fuel reserves had been prepared in advance during the formulation and implementation of the Five-Year Plan to ensure that the fuel-consuming sectors of the national economy not only completed but also exceeded their tasks, then there would have been no need to take these measures.

This fact shows how important it is to correctly determine the proportions in the plan and to prevent inconsistencies and imbalances in a timely manner, because eliminating these phenomena after they have occurred often causes huge losses to the national economy and incurs additional expenses. The larger the scale of production, the greater the danger of imbalances, and the more scientifically based our plans should be; in this regard, long-term plans have particularly significant meaning.

Taking into account the experience of planning work in the post-war period, and in order to further strengthen and improve planning work, the CPSU Central Committee and the USSR Council of Ministers adopted a decision in June 1955 on improving state planning work and reorganizing the work of the USSR State Planning Committee. On the basis of the original USSR State Planning Committee, the State Committee for Long-Term Planning of the National Economy of the USSR Council of Ministers (USSR State Planning Committee) and the State Economic Committee for Annual Planning of the National Economy of the USSR Council of Ministers (USSR State Economic Committee) were established.

The establishment of the State Committee for Long-Term Planning will raise the level of work in formulating and checking the implementation of long-term plans. Not only should long-term plans be formulated for the entire national economy and various economic sectors, but also long-term plans must be formulated for each enterprise, construction project, collective farm, and state farm, which will have great organizational significance. This enables us to determine the development prospects and specialization issues of each enterprise in the near future, as well as to establish the most rational connections between various enterprises, thereby identifying supplementary reserves for developing production.

The establishment of the State Economic Committee for Annual Planning has created the necessary conditions for improving the preparation of annual plans, strengthening the supervision of the implementation of annual plans, identifying supplementary reserves for developing production, and preventing and eliminating inconsistencies and imbalances.

The reorganization of the State Planning Committee has been in place for eight months, and we can say that the measures implemented in this regard have proven to be completely correct.

Because the USSR State Planning Committee was able to concentrate all its efforts on formulating the draft directives for the Sixth Five-Year Plan, and the State Economic Planning Committee was able to concentrate its efforts on formulating the draft plan for 1956, both drafts were able to be prepared and submitted to the CPSU Central Committee and the USSR Council of Ministers in a much shorter period than before.

The timely preparation of the annual plan draft by the State Economic Planning Committee enabled the Presidium of the USSR Council of Ministers, with the participation of the relevant republics, ministries, and departments, to carefully review the annual plan draft and approve it one and a half months before the start of 1956.

This ensures that the basic tasks of the State Planning Committee can be passed down to various enterprises and construction units before the start of the planning year. Everyone knows that this is of great significance to their work, because they are able to put their work on the right track at the very beginning of the planning year.

The good experience of planning work under the new conditions mentioned above, we naturally only regard them as the first step in seriously improving the planned leadership of the economy. The task of the USSR State Planning Committee and the USSR State Economic Committee is to continuously improve the work of formulating national long-term plans and current plans, and to ensure comprehensive coordination and close connection in all national economic planning work. At the same time, it is necessary to improve the economic level of our statistical work and ensure the improvement of the work of statistical agencies.

Comrades! To improve national planning work, it is necessary to fully enhance the role and responsibility of the All-Union ministries, the Union-Republican ministries, the Republican organs, and the local organs for economic leadership, and it is necessary to constantly improve the planning work of various departments and directly improve the planning work of enterprises, construction units, collective farms, and state farms.

At the same time, we must never forget the two aspects closely related to planning work. When talking about the essential characteristics of planning, the great Lenin said that our plan is a national plan, a task assigned to the masses of working people, and a law that must be implemented. He said that at the same time, planning work should also rely on the creative spirit of the masses, which enables us to accelerate development, help us improve, better, and change our plans, and complete these plans ahead of schedule. Without considering these two aspects, there can be no truly scientific planning work.

Recently, the Party's Central Committee and the government have taken a series of measures, the implementation of which will ensure a great improvement in planning work and in the work of leading the economy.

As everyone knows, the Party and the government exposed the serious shortcomings and errors that existed in our agricultural planning work, which led us to over-centralize planning and to prescribe too many indicators for collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms. This was unnecessary, and it was neither in the interest of the state nor in the interest of the collective farms and collective farmers. It restricted the initiative of the collective farms and machine tractor stations, weakened their sense of responsibility and interest in developing agricultural production, failed to stimulate the collective farms to increase the yield on the land they used, and reduced the possibility for the collective farms to obtain high incomes.

The new planning system, which the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the USSR Council of Ministers established at the beginning of 1955 and which aims to give play to the initiative of collective farms, state farms, and machine tractor stations, is the most important lever for further rapid upsurge in agricultural production. In the first year of adopting this planning system, the operating enthusiasm of the collective farms has already been manifested. They have improved the structure of cultivated land, made more correct use of agricultural land, and increased agricultural output.

Another important measure in improving planned leadership in agriculture is that in determining the procurement plan for agricultural products, instead of determining only one year's procurement plan as in the past, we now determine the plan for two years (1956 and 1957), thus enabling collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms to formulate annual production and financial plans in a timely manner and to submit these plans to the broad discussion of collective farmers, machine tractor station and state farm staff, and agricultural experts.

The implementation of the new system for formulating agricultural production plans will place new and higher demands on local Party organizations, Soviet organs, local planning organs, and agricultural organs. At the same time, its implementation also requires the USSR State Planning Committee and the USSR State Economic Committee, which formulate long-term plans and current plans for agricultural development, to seriously improve their work and to correctly distribute agricultural production and implement specialization in various regions.

Comrades!
In addition to the above-mentioned principled revisions made in the practical work of agricultural production planning, the role of the industrial leadership organs of the republics has also been greatly enhanced based on the initiative of the Party Central Committee.

In 1954 and 1955, more than 11,000 industrial enterprises were transferred to the management of the republics. Some new Union-Republican ministries have been established in the constituent republics of Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan.

The planning of the production and distribution of various products of industrial enterprises in the constituent republics has been directly entrusted to the Councils of Ministers of the constituent republics.

Only the part of the allocated products produced by the enterprises of the ministries of the constituent republics and the enterprises of the handicraft cooperatives that is not needed by the republic's economy is allocated in the state supply plan of the USSR national economy. For many important allocated products produced by enterprises of All-Union ministries and Union-Republican ministries, 25% is left to the Councils of Ministers of the constituent republics, and for some products that exceed the quarterly plan, 50% can also be left. This system enables the Councils of Ministers of the constituent republics to control additional material resources, thus enhancing their concern for completing and over-fulfilling the plans of the enterprises of the ministries of the constituent republics and the Union-Republican ministries.

The supplementary income that appears and is obtained in the execution of the state budget in the constituent republics is used by the Council of Ministers of the republic as allocations for housing, public utilities, and social and cultural measures—including investment. This has enabled the constituent republics to add more than 700 million rubles to their economies in 1955, relying on the income part of over-fulfilling the budget, which is more than the amount stipulated in the state budget.

When formulating the 1956 plan, the USSR State Economic Committee and the representatives of the Councils of Ministers of the constituent republics carefully studied the draft plans that conformed to the tasks of developing the economies of the constituent republics and the All-Union economies within those republics. In this regard, the financial and material needs of the republic's economy have been more fully estimated.

State investment used to develop the republic's economy has increased by 26% in the 1956 plan compared to 1955, and this has been achieved while the total amount of capital construction in the USSR national economy has increased by 14%. The amount of materials allocated from centralized funds for the needs of the republic's economy has also greatly increased.

The measures that have been taken will ensure further strengthening of the role of the constituent republics in economic leadership and will improve the planning work of the republic's economy. Our task is to carefully study the new planning situation and, on the basis of this study, continue to improve in this regard.

It seems that the need to transfer a broader responsibility for supervising the development of the entire economy (the economy distributed within the republic, regardless of which department the enterprise belongs to) to the Councils of Ministers of the constituent republics has matured. What I am referring to is, in particular, the supervision of the measures implemented by the All-Union ministries and the Union-Republican ministries in the distribution, specialization, and cooperation of enterprises within the republic; at the same time, it should be pointed out that, as experience has proven, without this supervision and organizational influence of the Councils of Ministers of the constituent republics, serious shortcomings will arise in this regard.

Great work has been done in expanding the authority of ministers, directors of administrative bureaus, and enterprise managers in leading economic activities. The indicators of tasks stipulated by the national plan have been greatly reduced. The planning of the production and distribution of many types of products has been directly entrusted to the ministries and departments.

Experience has proven the positive significance of the measures taken in this regard. However, it must be pointed out that some leaders of ministries and departments have not fully utilized the powers given to them, do not independently solve problems related to economic leadership, but attempt to cover themselves with various regulations and draft measures under various pretexts. They send a large number of such drafts to the USSR Council of Ministers for review, although these drafts do not all need to be reviewed. I think these shortcomings are temporary, and the leaders of ministries and departments will gradually overcome these shortcomings.

When the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union passed the resolution to greatly expand the authority of ministers and department leaders in economic leadership, they believed that it was necessary to simultaneously strengthen the sense of responsibility of these leaders for the tasks they undertake. Only under such conditions can the national plan be most correctly combined with the plans of various departments of the national economy, various enterprises, construction units, collective farms, and state farms. In this regard, whether it is the national plan or the development plan of individual departments of the national economy, it should fully reflect the interests of the country and maximize the use of existing reserves to develop socialist production.

However, it should be pointed out that some leaders of ministries and departments do not correctly understand their tasks in formulating plans and leading the economy. When formulating and implementing plans, they use their energy to ask the state for additional funds and resources, rather than discovering and utilizing existing internal potential, in order to ensure the completion of the already approved plans while maximizing the conservation of state funds.

To avoid empty talk, I will give some concrete examples. For example, when formulating the 1955 plan, some ministries and departments suggested stipulating an average increase of 4% in labor productivity in industry. The government corrected this plan, and in fact, labor productivity increased by 8% in 1955. When compiling the 1956 plan, there were also similar situations, that is, the plan proposed by the ministries was lower than the possibility of labor productivity growth. Therefore, the Party and the government had to intervene and correct it again.

If the suggestions of certain ministries regarding labor and costs are adopted, it would be necessary to supplement approximately 2 million workers and staff in 1956 and increase the wage fund for the national economy by more than 20 billion rubles, and the cost of products would increase by 18 billion rubles. May I ask, how can we not regard these ministries' suggestions as manifestations of narrow departmentalism? Certain ministries and departments lower the task of increasing labor productivity, thereby requiring an increase in labor and wage funds, and they often strive to underestimate the potential for increasing output in their units.

The Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy of the Soviet Union can be cited as an example. The plan it insisted on when discussing the 1956 plan was to produce 1.3 million tons less steel and 1.7 million tons less steel products than the plan approved by the government. It should be pointed out that this ministry also requested that a lower task of producing steel be stipulated for it when formulating the 1955 plan. The government rejected this suggestion and adopted a higher plan, which was later not only completed but also over-fulfilled: more than 570,000 tons of steel and more than 200,000 tons of steel products were produced. The Ministry of Coal Industry of the Soviet Union, the Ministry of Building Materials Industry, and some other ministries also proposed depressed plans. At the same time, various ministries and departments have made excessive demands for state investment, which are disproportionate to the existing resources of the national economy and the needs of these ministries. In order for the representatives of the Congress to know how the leaders of some ministries do not consider the capacity and resources of the national economy, it is enough to talk about the following fact: The ministries requested an additional allocation of 60 billion rubles beyond the basic investment amount approved in the 1956 plan, that is, more than one-third of the total basic investment in 1955.

When various ministries and departments deliberately lowered the 1955 industrial production plan, they made material and technical requirements that greatly exceeded the actual needs of ensuring their production. For example, the requirement for steel was increased by 5 million tons.

I believe that in order to complete and over-fulfill the annual plans and Five-Year Plans approved by the Party and the government, we have the right to condemn this intentional act of various ministries to depress indicators when formulating plans. Practice has shown that the tasks approved by the government to increase production, increase labor productivity, and reduce product costs can be completed and over-fulfilled by relying on the funds and material resources allocated by the state.

Comrades!
The Soviet state uses a large amount of funds every year to develop the national economy. The total amount of basic investment stipulated in the Sixth Five-Year Plan is 990 billion rubles.

We must use these funds most effectively and not allow completed enterprises to fail to fully utilize their capacity.

At the same time, experience shows that we have not fully considered the possibility of expanding the production of existing enterprises in the plan. The results of the implementation of the Fifth Five-Year Plan can particularly prove this point. In the Fifth Five-Year Plan, although the plan to put new production capacity into operation was far from being completed, the production plans of some of the most important industrial sectors have been over-fulfilled. For example, although the task of putting into operation rolling mills capable of producing 4.8 million tons of steel was not completed, the steel production plan was over-fulfilled by 700,000 tons. The task of using mines and open-pit coal mines capable of producing 21 million tons of coal was not completed, but the amount of coal mined has been over-fulfilled by 18 million tons. There are similar situations in many other industrial sectors.

In addition to the need to vigorously improve the work of construction institutions in order to accelerate the speed of construction and fully complete the task of putting new production capacity into production, we should not relax but should step up the improvement of the utilization of existing productive forces. We should first take some measures that do not require the state to spend more money or can be realized with little money to use the existing possibilities that can increase productivity. There are not small possibilities in this area. In most industrial sectors and most factories, the level of utilization of production capacity can be greatly improved.

For example, let's take a look at the situation of the mines of the Ministry of Coal Industry of the Soviet Union using the designed production capacity. The fact is that most large mines are unable to fully utilize the designed production capacity until five to six years, sometimes more than six years, after being put into production. For example, the designed production capacity of the No. 12-18 mine of "Truth" of the "Budennovsk Coal Industry" Trust in Donbass is 1,000 tons per day. It was put into production in 1949, but now, that is, in the seventh year after being put into production, only 42% of the designed production capacity is being used. The designed production capacity of the No. 17-17 (B) mine of "Krasnoluch Coal Industry" Trust is 3,000 tons per day. It was put into production in 1950, and only 39% of the designed production capacity was used in 1955. Similar situations exist in many other mines in Donets and other coal areas.

In the Sixth Five-Year Plan, economic and planning agencies should carry out huge work in expanding and adjusting the specialization and collaboration of various enterprises. This issue has been fully raised at the July Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee. This issue was also discussed in the reports of Comrades Khrushchev and Bulganin. I want to say that we must do a lot of work in 1956.

Those ministries that have done this work practically have achieved good results. For example, due to the implementation of the specialization of turbine factories, the number of types and sizes of production machines has been reduced, and the power generation capacity of each engine unit has been increased. The production of steam turbines in the previous Five-Year Plan has increased by 1 million kilowatts of power generation capacity without increasing the production site. If these measures had not been implemented, it would have cost 400 million to 500 million rubles to build a new turbine factory.

The 1956 plan stipulates several measures in terms of specialization, especially stipulating restrictions on the variety of parts produced by factories and eliminating the unreasonable duplication of manufacturing similar parts in different factories. This primarily refers to the production of spare parts, automobiles, tractors, agricultural machinery, diesel engines, turbine generators, hydraulic generators, large electrical machines, power transformers, electric motors, and several other types of equipment and machines.

The departmentalism of our economic organs and the unwillingness of various ministries to consider the interests of the country and their attempt to "squeeze" inter-factory cooperation into a narrow internal system have resulted in various unreasonable phenomena. These practices are the most vicious enemies of implementing specialization and collaboration. These bad practices should be eradicated as soon as possible.

Last year, the USSR State Economic Committee, together with the USSR State Planning Committee, with the participation of local Party organizations and Soviet organs, comprehensively inspected the work of 68 enterprises in eastern Siberia and the Far East. The focus of their inspection work was on the utilization of the production capacity of these enterprises and their specialization and collaboration. The results of this inspection showed that the ministries and departments in charge of the above-mentioned enterprises completely failed to consider the possibilities of their specialization and collaboration when planning their work, and they also failed to consider the issue of meeting the needs of the nearby areas for their products. The suggestions drafted on this issue have been approved by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and corresponding resolutions have been passed on this suggestion.

The State Economic Committee, together with the State Planning Committee, has comprehensively inspected the current status of enterprise specialization and collaboration in several major industrial centers and economic regions, primarily Leningrad and the Urals, and has drawn up corresponding improvement suggestions. The above-mentioned work will help us to rectify the work in this regard.

At the same time, we should start drafting a long-term plan for the development of enterprise specialization and collaboration in major industrial centers and economic regions in accordance with the provisions of the draft directives.

I would like to say a few words about an important potential for increasing production—saving materials. The draft directives of the Sixth Five-Year Plan stipulate major tasks regarding the conservation of raw materials, materials, and fuel. During the Five-Year Plan, the unit consumption of metal should be reduced by an average of at least 22%. Whether this task is completed directly affects the planned expansion of the production of machinery manufacturing and metal processing industries. Only such a scale of savings can ensure that the production of machinery manufacturing and metal processing industries increases by approximately 80% under the conditions that the production of steel and steel products increases by 51% to 52%.

Obviously, the pre-determined savings target cannot be guaranteed by simply tightening the consumption quotas of raw materials and materials required for the production of products. This is unrealistic, and it can only lead to imbalances in production and prevent the pre-determined production increase target from being completed. We do not intend to tighten the conditions of material supply at all. On the contrary, we must maintain great stability in material supply, especially to increase the material reserves used by the national economy in the short term. The problem lies in completing the Five-Year Plan with the least material consumption on the basis of technological progress and the increasing perfection of technology and production organization.

If our designers and construction workers not only study the highest utilization indicators of their products but also conscientiously find the most economical way from the perspective of saving raw materials and materials, then the task of saving materials can be victoriously completed and over-fulfilled.

While increasing the productivity of various machinery and equipment, it is also necessary to reduce their weight and reduce their volume. This is an important potential that should be strived to utilize for the further growth and conservation of production in the national economy. At the same time, there is sufficient reason to point out here that the individual difficulties encountered by the national economy in terms of metal supply and the large amount of metal wasted by metal users are to a large extent due to the fact that the Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy has not paid due attention to the production of economic profile steel and has allowed the plan for supplying metal by grade to be disrupted.

Everyone knows how important it is to save fuel in the national economy, but many ministries have not paid the necessary attention to such an important matter. This primarily refers to the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Power Stations, the Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy, and the ministry of Building Materials Industry, which are the ministries that use the most fuel in our country; as well as the ministry of Coal Industry, which supplies coal of inappropriate varieties, which is difficult to utilize without loss.

Here, we supply ordinary coal instead of screened coal or coal briquettes for railway locomotives. This causes the railway to waste 10 million tons of coal a year. It is already time to require the Ministry of Coal Industry of the Soviet Union to change to supplying high-grade coal and coal briquettes more quickly.

Power stations also have considerable potential for saving fuel. The power stations of the Ministry of Power Stations are extremely slow to master new equipment. This alone causes high-voltage power stations to burn an additional 1 million tons of standard coal every year.

Saving materials and using materials reasonably is such an important national event that it deserves the attention of all our economic agencies and Party organizations.

Comrades! The Sixth Five-Year Plan is a new and vivid example of the continuous upsurge of the socialist economy, the improvement of the people's welfare, and the prosperity of culture and science. This plan has been unanimously supported by all the people of our country. All the people of the Soviet Union fully believe that the new Five-Year Plan will be completed as smoothly as the previous Five-Year Plans.

The achievements of the great Soviet Union mark the victory of peaceful constructive labor for the welfare of the people, for the happiness and pleasant life of every Soviet person. This fact is our strongest ally in the economic competition between socialism and capitalism. Under the influence of this fact, the number of friends of the Soviet Union is increasing day by day. Now, not only the people of the people's democratic countries but also the people of other countries support us and sympathize with our cause.

The Communist Party and the Soviet government have expressed the innermost wishes of their own people and of all honest ordinary people in the world. They have executed, and will continue to unswervingly execute, a policy of maintaining world peace, a policy of making their national economy prosper, and a policy of peaceful cooperation with all countries in the world that are willing to live with us in peace.

Comrades! The Sixth Five-Year Plan embodies the wishes of millions of Soviet people, who are the creators and builders of a communist society. The Sixth Five-Year Plan unfolds new prospects of greater strength and prosperity for our motherland, the first country in the world to achieve socialist victory, to the great Soviet people. These prospects inspire the Soviet people to establish new labor merits for the victory of communism. (Applause)

    萨布罗夫在苏共代表大会上的发言
    同志们！从我们党第十九次代表大会到现在，时间是比较短的。但是在这段时间里，在我们国家中实行了一些重大的政治和经济措施，这些措施加强了苏维埃国家的威力，提高了它的国际威信，巩固了工人阶级同农民的联盟，为社会主义经济各个部门的新的强大的高涨创造了条件。
    党根据国家由于顺利完成第五个五年计划而增长起来的经济力量，向人民提出了新的任务，实现这些任务就使我们能够在共产主义建设的道路上得到大大的进展。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志和尼·亚·布尔加宁同志的报告，以及公布出来供全民审查和讨论的共产党第二十次代表大会关于苏联发展国民经济的第六个五年计划的指示草案，都说明了这些任务。
    赫鲁晓夫同志和布尔加宁同志在报告中阐述的我们党和全体苏联人民未来工作的广泛计划，得到了一致的拥护。这说明大家毫不怀疑这个纲领是正确的和现实的，毫不怀疑尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志报告中所提出的一些具有巨大原则意义的问题——社会主义经济制度和资本主义经济制度共处的问题、现时代防止战争的可能性的问题、不同国家向社会主义过渡的道路问题——是正确的和及时的。
    中央委员会创造性地研究了这些马克思列宁主义理论上的最重大的问题，使我们的党和其他国家的共产党在自己的实际工作中有正确的方向，能够估计到社会发展的具体情况和已经形成的历史条件。
    在提交本次代表大会审查的指示草案中，规定在重工业优先增长的基础上，进一步全面发展国民经济，规定急剧发展农业生产和大大提高苏联人民的物质福利和文化生活水平。其中特别重视加速技术进步和提高社会劳动生产率的必要性，因为这是社会主义经济不断迅速增长的最重要的条件。
    指示草案中规定的国民经济发展的速度，和国民经济所有各部门生产增长的范围和规模，将保证我们在解决苏联的基本经济任务方面能够有很大的进展，这一基本任务就是在经济方面，即在产量按人口计算方面赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家。
    现在我们已经具备一切必要的条件和可能在比较短的历史时期内解决这个任务。
    在战前的13年中，我们把自己的国家从以前的落后的国家变成了先进的国家，从农业国变成了工业强国。
    但是，如果把战前的几个五年计划工业生产增长的绝对数额和第六个五年计划的任务比较一下，你们就会看到，第六个五年计划的经济发展速度将远远超过战前的几个五年计划。在战前所有的五年计划期间，生铁产量只增加了1，100多万吨，而在第六个五年计划的五年中将增加约2，000万吨。在战前几个五年计划期间，苏联的钢产量只增加了1，400万吨，而在第六个五年计划期间，钢产量就将增加2，300万吨。在战前几个五年计划期间，煤产量只增加了13，000万吨，而在第六个五年计划期间，煤产量就将增加20，200万吨。最后，战前几个五年计划期间的石油产量只增加了1，900多万吨，而在第六个五年计划期间，石油产量将增加6，400万吨。
    固然，在工业品产量按人口计算方面，我们还没有赶上美国，在工业总产量方面，也暂时还没有赶上美国。但是我们的发展速度要比美国工业的发展速度超过好多倍，这使我们有可能在最短的历史时期内克服这种落后状况。和平经济建设的全部经验证明，苏联能够顺利解决自己的主要经济任务。我们丝毫不怀疑，如果没有人来妨碍我们，我们很快就能解决这个任务。妨碍我们的首先是战争。苏联存在了38年，在这个期间，我们大约有18年的时间是消耗在强加在我们身上的战争和恢复被这些战争破坏的经济上面。
    大家知道，第二次世界大战把我国的工业发展推迟了大约两个五年计划的时间。统计材料表明，如果苏联的和平经济建设没有被这个战争打断，按照我们在战后和恢复时期所达到的生产增长速度，苏联的工业在1955年本来可以生产大约7，500万吨钢，56，000万吨煤，12，500万吨石油，2，500亿度电力和4，000万吨水泥。在这种情况下，按照第六个五年计划指示草案规定的发展速度，我们一定能够在工业总产量方面赶上美国的现代生产水平，并且在某些最重要的产品方面，超过这个水平。
    在我们同资本主义制度的经济竞赛中，一个特别重要的因素是苏联的重工业在最重要的工业产品的绝对增加量上也在开始超过主要的资本主义国家。
    例如，在最近五年内，美国的生铁产量只增加了1，060万吨，三个西欧国家（英国、法国和西德）总共增加了1，300万吨，而苏联则增加了1，400万吨。
    最近5年中，美国的钢产量增加了1，700万吨，上述三个西欧国家总共增加了1，670万吨，而苏联则增加了将近1，800万吨。
    同时，指出这一点是重要的：社会主义经济（它的发展的主要推动力和最终目标是最大限度地满足整个社会不断增长的物质和文化需要）在本质上和性质上是和平的经济，为了胜利完成社会主义建设的伟大任务，我们不需要战争。我们的经济，不论过去和现在，都是在和平时期得到迅速的发展，而美国的经济却是在很大程度上依靠战争发展起来的，由于在本世纪中，美国参加的各次战争都是在它的领土以外进行的，它的发展就更加是这样了。
    同志们，这不是宣传，这是确定不移的历史事实。我们来比较一下在战争年代与和平年代里我国工业和美国工业的发展指标吧！在战前的和平经济建设时期（1927年到1940年），苏联工业产量每年增加18.6％，而美国的工业只增加2％。在第二次世界大战时期，由于战争造成的巨大破坏，苏联工业没有能够增加它的产量，在1945年，它的产量只达到1940年的92％，而美国工业的产量在这个期间却增加了60％。战争结束以后，和平建设时期开始了，我国工业重新得到迅速的发展。在1948年到1955年，苏联工业产量每年增加16.6％，而美国的工业只增加4.1％。
    这样看来，社会主义世界不需要战争，战争只对资本主义垄断组织有利，而现在美国和英国的帝国主义集团是把经济军事化看做避免危机、保持现有的工业生产水平的唯一手段，这不是很明显的吗？
    在美国、英国和其他国家的某些集团中流行的那种所谓战争威胁来自苏联的说法是一种胡说和诽谤，这不是很明显的吗？
    还有什么能够比这更加令人信服地证明社会主义和资本主义的利益是正相反的呢？的确，根据这些材料我们可以肯定说：侵略战争是同我们的意愿、同我们的目的和任务不能相容的和完全敌对的，因为侵略战争妨碍我们在同资本主义的和平经济竞赛中前进，妨碍我们在共产主义社会建设中前进。
    同志们！我们党中央委员会提交第二十次代表大会审查的关于第六个五年计划的指示草案，是以战后期间和平经济建设的成就为根据的，并且也指望今后有和平的发展条件。
    苏联人民赞成并且一致拥护关于发展国民经济的第六个五年计划的指示草案。我们的总任务，即所有党组织、苏维埃机关、经济组织、工会组织和青年团组织的任务就是，要协助所有企业、建筑单位、集体农庄和国营农场在社会主义建设的各个方面顺利地完成五年计划。为了胜利地解决这一任务，我们必须加速技术进步，保证进一步大大提高劳动生产率，认真地提高经济领导的水平，提高生产计划工作和生产管理工作的水平。
    如果认为社会主义经济制度的优越性本身就能够保证我们的计划胜利完成，那就错了。经验证明，如果不最大限度地动员一切力量，如果不经常改善我们整个的组织工作和经济工作，要胜利地完成计划是不可能的。
    党的中央委员会和政府为了改进我们的整个经济领导工作——其中包括改进计划工作——在最近时期采取了一系列的措施。我想谈谈与计划工作有关的一些问题，谈谈这方面的缺点和克服这些缺点的办法。
    首先我想向代表大会报告一下关于改进国民经济计划工作方面所采取的措施。
    社会主义经济按其性质来说是有计划的经济。它和资本主义经济发展的自发性规律是不相容的，资本主义经济的发展必然带有跳跃和衰落现象、带有危机和震荡。但是不能够由此就得出结论说，无论在任何条件下，我国国民经济的发展都不可能产生困难，都不可能发生不相适应的现象和不合比例的现象。
    社会主义生产发展的客观规律不会自动地发生作用。只有全面地研究了这些规律的要求和在我们计划中正确地考虑它们，才能够防止国民经济中的不相适应的现象和不合比例的现象，从而保证国民经济各个部门的迅速发展。
    在这方面有很多事情是取决于全国的计划机关，这些计划机关在制定计划和检查计划的完成情况的时候，必须在计划中保证国民经济各部门有计划地和按比例地发展。从执行第五个五年计划的过程中，我们可以看出这一点是如何重要。执行第五个五年计划的总结表明，如果在制定计划和实现计划的时候使上述的要求得到充分保证，那末我们的经济建设在上一个五年计划中会得到更大的成就。我只要举出一个例子就可以证明这一点。从第五个五年计划的后半期就暴露出煤炭工业的发展落后于国民经济的日益迅速增长的需要。苏联欧洲部分的工业燃料部门由于缺乏燃料而遭遇到了困难。
    由于苏共中央和政府采取了有效的措施，煤炭的产量在五年计划末期已经大大提高了，这样，整个说来就保证了目前国民经济对燃料的需要。如果在制定五年计划和实现五年计划的时候预先准备了足够的燃料后备，足以保证国民经济中需要燃料的部门不仅完成并且超额完成任务，那末就没有必要采取这些措施了。
    这个事实表明，在计划中正确地规定比例和及时防止不相适应的现象和不合比例的现象是如何的重要，因为在不合比例的现象发生以后再去消除这种现象，常常会使国民经济受到巨大的损失和支出额外的费用。生产的规模愈大，不合比例现象的危险性就愈大，我们的计划就愈应当有科学的根据；在这方面，远景计划有特别重大的意义。
    考虑到战后时期计划工作的经验，并且为了进一步加强和改善计划工作，苏共中央委员会和苏联部长会议1955年6月通过了一项关于改进国家计划工作和改组苏联国家计划委员会的工作的决定。在原来的苏联国家计划委员会的基础上，成立了苏联部长会议国民经济长期计划国家委员会（苏联国家计划委员会）和苏联部长会议国民经济年度计划国家经济委员会（苏联国家经济委员会）。
    长期计划国家委员会的建立，将会提高制定远景计划和检查远景计划执行情况的工作的水平。不但要制定整个国民经济和各个经济部门的远景计划，而且必须制定每个企业、建筑工程、集体农庄和国营农场的远景计划，这将有很大的组织意义。这使我们有可能确定每一个企业最近若干年中的发展远景和它的专门化问题，以及确立各个企业之间的最合理的联系，从而找出发展生产的补充后备。
    年度计划国家经济委员会的建立，为改进年度计划的编制工作、加强对年度计划的执行情况的监督、找出发展生产的补充后备以及防止和消除不相适应和不合比例的现象创造了必要条件。
    国家计划委员会改组已经有8个月了，我们可以说，在这方面所实行的措施已经证明是完全正确的。
    由于苏联国家计划委员会能够集中全部精力来制定关于第六个五年计划的指示草案，而国家经济计划委员会能够集中精力来制定1956年度的计划草案，这就使得这两个草案能够在比以前短得多的时期内同时拟就，并且提交给苏共中央和苏联部长会议。
    国家经济计划委员会年度计划草案的及时拟就，使苏联部长会议主席团能够在有关的各共和国、各部和各主管机关参加之下，对年度计划草案进行仔细的审查，并且在1956年开始以前的一个半月内予以批准。
    这样就保证了国家计划委员会的基本任务在计划年度开始以前就能够下达到各个企业和建筑单位去。大家知道，这对它们的工作有很大的意义，因为它们能够在本计划年度一开始的时候就把工作纳入正轨。
    上面谈到的这些在新条件下的计划工作的良好经验，我们自然只把它们看作是在认真改进经济的计划领导工作方面的第一步。苏联国家计划委员会和苏联国家经济委员会的任务是要不断地改进制定国家的远景计划和现行计划的工作，保证全部国民经济计划工作中的全面配合和密切联系。同时，必须提高我国统计工作的经济水平，保证改进统计机关的工作。
    同志们！要改进全国计划工作，就必须全力提高全联盟各部、联盟兼共和国各部、共和国机关和各地方机关对经济领导的作用和责任心，必须经常改进各种部门的计划工作，并且直接改进企业、建筑单位、集体农庄和国营农场的计划工作。
    同时，我们绝不应当忘记计划工作密切联系着的两个方面。伟大的列宁在谈到计划的实质的特征时说道，我们的计划是国家计划，是交给劳动人民群众的任务，是一定要执行的法律。他说，同时，计划工作还应该依靠群众的创造精神，这种创造精神使我们有可能加快发展，帮助我们改进、改善和改变我们的计划，使这些计划提前完成。不考虑到这两个方面，就不能够有真正科学的计划工作。
    最近，党中央委员会和政府采取了一系列的措施，实现这些措施就能够保证大大地改进计划工作和领导经济的工作。
    大家知道，党和政府揭露了我们在农业计划工作方面存在的严重缺点和错误，这些缺点和错误使我们把计划过分集中，为集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场规定了过多的指标。这样做是没有必要的，它既不符合于国家的利益，也不符合于集体农庄和集体农民的利益，它束缚了集体农庄和机器拖拉机站的主动性，减弱了他们对发展农业生产的责任心和兴趣，不能够刺激集体农庄提高它们使用的土地上的产量，缩小了集体农庄得到高额收入的可能性。
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议在1955年初所规定的旨在发挥集体农庄、国营农场和机器拖拉机站的主动性的新的计划工作制度，是使农业生产进一步急剧高涨的最重要的杠杆。在采用这种计划工作制度的第一年，集体农庄的经营积极性就已经表现出来了，它们改善了耕地的结构，更加正确地利用了农业土地，增加了农业的产量。
    在改进对农业的计划领导方面，还有一个重要的措施，就是在确定农产品收购计划的时候，不像过去那样只确定一年的收购计划，而是两年（1956年和1957年）的计划，这样就使集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场有可能适时地制定年度的生产财务计划，并且把这些计划交给集体农民、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作人员以及农业专家们广泛讨论。
    制定农业生产计划的新制度的实现，将对地方党组织、苏维埃机关、对地方的计划机关和农业机关提出新的更高的要求。同时，它的实现也要求制定农业发展远景计划和现行计划的苏联国家计划委员会和苏联国家经济委员会认真地改进工作，要求正确地分布农业生产和实行各个地区的专业化。
    同志们！
    除了在农业生产计划的实际工作中所做的上述原则性修改以外，根据党中央的倡议各共和国工业领导机关的作用也大大提高了。
    在1954年和1955年中，有11，000多个工业企业移交给各共和国管理。在乌克兰、哈萨克和阿塞拜疆等加盟共和国里成立了一些新的联盟兼共和国的部。
    加盟共和国工业企业的各种产品的生产和分配的计划工作，已经交由各加盟共和国部长会议直接负责。
    加盟共和国各部的企业和工艺合作社企业出产的调拨产品，只有共和国经济不需用的那一部分，才在苏联国民经济国家供应计划中加以分配。全联盟各部和联盟兼共和国部的企业所出产的许多种重要的调拨产品，25％留交加盟共和国部长会议掌握，全共和国超过季度计划所生产出来的某些产品，还可以留下50％。这种制度使各加盟共和国部长会议能够掌握额外的物质资源，因而能够提高它们对完成和超额完成加盟共和国各部和联盟兼共和国各部的企业的计划的关心。
    在加盟共和国执行国家预算中所出现和得到的补充收入，由该共和国部长会议用来作为对住宅、公用事业和社会文化措施的拨款——其中包括投资。这使得加盟共和国在1955年靠超额完成预算的收入部分而对自己经济增加了比国家预算所规定的多出7亿卢布以上的拨款。
    在制定1956年计划的时候，苏联国家经济委员会和各加盟共和国部长会议的代表一道，详细地研究了符合于发展加盟共和国经济和在各该共和国境内的全联盟经济的任务的计划草案。在这方面，更充分地估计了共和国经济在财政经费和物资方面的需要。
    用于发展共和国经济的国家投资，在1956年的计划中比1955年增加了26％，而这是在苏联国民经济的基本建设总额增加14％的情况下达到的。从集中的资金中拨出供共和国经济需要的物资数额也大大增加了。
    已经采取的措施将保证进一步加强加盟共和国在经济领导方面的作用，将改进共和国经济的计划工作。我们的任务就是：详细地研究新的计划工作情况，并在这种研究的基础上在这方面继续提高。
    看来，把更广泛的、监督全部经济（分布于各该共和国境内的经济，不管是哪个部门的企业）发展的职责移交给各加盟共和国部长会议的必要性，已经成熟了。我所指的特别是，监督全联盟各部及联盟兼共和国各部在各该共和国境内实行企业的分布、专业化、合作化的措施的情况；同时，应当指出，正如经验所证明的，没有各加盟共和国部长会议的这种监督和组织的影响，在这方面就会产生严重的缺点。
    在扩大部长、管理总局局长、企业经理的领导经济活动的权限这方面，已经做了巨大的工作。国家计划所规定的任务的指标已经大大缩小了。很多种产品的生产和分配的计划工作已经交由各部和各主管机关直接负责。
    经验证明了在这方面所采取的措施的积极意义。但是必须指出，有些部和主管机关的领导者没有充分利用给予他们的权力，不独立地解决有关经济领导的问题，而企图在各种各样的借口下，用各种规定和措施的草案来掩饰自己，他们把大量的这样的草案送交苏联部长会议审查，虽然这些草案并不是都需要审查的。我想，这些缺点是暂时的，各部和各主管机关的领导者将逐渐克服这些缺点。
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议在通过大大扩大部长和主管机关领导者在经济领导方面的权限的决议的时候，认为必须同时加强这些领导者对所担负的任务的责任心。只有在这样的条件下，才能把全国的计划同国民经济各个部门、各个企业、建筑单位、集体农庄和国营农场的计划最正确地结合起来。在这方面，不论国家计划或国民经济个别部门发展的计划，都应当充分反映全国的利益和最大限度利用现有后备以发展社会主义生产的利益。
    但是应当指出，各部和主管机关的个别领导者对自己在制定计划和领导经济方面的任务了解得不正确，他们在制定和执行计划的时候，把本机关的精力用来向国家索取额外资金和资源，而不是发掘和利用现有的内部潜力，以便在最大限度地节约国家资金的情况下，保证完成已经通过的计划。
    为了避免讲空话，我举一些具体的例子。例如，在制定1955年的计划的时候，某些部和主管机关曾建议规定工业方面劳动生产率平均增长4％。政府纠正了这种计划，而实际上1955年劳动生产率增长了8％。在编制1956年计划的时候，也有和这相类似的情况，就是说，部里提出的计划比劳动生产率增长的可能性要低，于是，党和政府又不得不加以干涉，加以纠正。
    如果采用某些部关于劳动和成本的建议，就必须在1956年补充大约200万工人和职员，增加200多亿卢布的国民经济方面的工资基金，产品成本要增加180亿卢布。试问，怎么能不把这些部的建议看作是狭隘的本位主义倾向的表现呢？某些部和主管机关降低提高劳动生产率的任务，因而要求增加劳动力和工资基金，它们往往力求低估本单位增加产量的潜力。
    可以举苏联钢铁工业部做例子。它在讨论1956年计划的时候所坚持的计划要比政府所通过的计划少出产130万吨钢、170万吨钢材。应该指出，这个部在制定1955年计划的时候也曾要求给它规定较低的生产钢铁的任务。政府拒绝了这个建议，并采取了一个更高的计划，这个计划后来不但完成了而且超额完成了：多生产了57万吨钢和20万吨以上钢材。苏联煤炭工业部、建筑材料工业部和其他一些部也提出了压低了的计划。与此同时，各个部和主管机关对国家投资提出了过分的要求，这些要求和国民经济现有的资源以及这些部的需要都是不相称的。为了使代表大会的代表们知道一些部的领导者是如何不考虑国民经济的能力和资源，只要谈谈下面的事实就够了：各部要求超出1956年计划所通过的基本投资数再补拨600亿卢布，即达到1955年基本投资总数的三分之一以上。
    各个部和各主管机关在故意降低1955年工业生产计划的时候，却在物质上和技术上提出了大大超过保证它们的生产的实际需要的要求。例如，对钢材的要求就加多了500万吨。
  我认为，为了完成和超额完成党和政府所批准的年度计划和五年计划，我们有权来指责各部在制定计划的时候有意压低指标的这种行为。实践表明，政府批准的增加生产、提高劳动生产率和减低产品成本的任务，是能够依靠国家分配的资金和物质资源来完成和超额完成的。
    同志们！
    苏维埃国家每年用了大量的资金来发展国民经济。第六个五年计划所规定的基本投资总额是9，900亿卢布。
    我们必须最有成效地来使用这些资金，不要使建成的企业不能充分发挥它们的能力。
    同时，经验表明，在计划中我们远没有充分考虑到扩大现有企业的生产的可能性。第五个五年计划的执行结果特别可以证明这一点。在第五个五年计划中，尽管动用新的生产能力的计划远没有完成，但是最重要的一些工业部门的生产计划却已经超额完成。例如，虽然动用能生产480万吨钢材的轧钢机的任务没有完成，而钢材的生产计划却超额70万吨完成了。使用能够生产2，100万吨煤的矿井和露天煤矿的任务没有完成。而采煤量却已经超额1，800万吨完成了。在其他许多工业部门中也有类似的情况。
    除了必须大力改进建筑机构的工作以便加快建设的速度和全部完成把新的生产能力投入生产的任务以外，我们也不应该放松而且应该加紧改善现有生产力的利用情况。首先应该采取一些不需要国家多花资金或者用不多的资金就可以实现的措施，来利用现有的可以提高生产力的可能性。而在这一方面的可能性是不小的。在大多数工业部门和大多数工厂中，利用生产能力的水平是可以大大提高的。
    例如，我们来看看苏联采煤工业部的矿井利用设计的生产能力的情况。事实是，大多数大矿井一直要到投入生产以后的五年到六年，有时要到六年以上才能够完全利用设计的生产能力。例如，在顿巴斯的“布琼诺夫斯克煤业”托辣斯的“真理”12—18号矿井的设计生产能力是一昼夜1，000吨，它是在1949年投入生产的，而现在，就是说在投入生产后的第七年，只利用了这个设计生产能力的42％。“克拉斯诺卢契煤业”托辣斯的17—17（乙）号矿井的设计的生产能力为一昼夜3，000吨，它是1950年投入生产的，在1955年只利用了设计的生产能力的39％。顿尼兹和其他煤区的其他许多矿井中也有类似的情况。
    经济机关和计划机关在第六个五年计划中应当在扩大和调整各企业的专业化和协作方面进行巨大的工作。这个问题在苏共中央七月全体会议上已经充分地提出来了。赫鲁晓夫同志和布尔加宁同志的报告中也谈到了这个问题。我要说，我们在1956年就必须做许多工作。
    那些切实地作了这项工作的部，已经获得了良好的结果。例如，由于实行了涡轮机工厂的专业化，减少了生产机器的类型和大小的数目，增加了每一台联动机的发电能力，蒸汽涡轮机的产品在上一个五年计划中在不增加生产场地的情形下增加了100万瓩的发电能力。如果没有实行这些措施，那么就得花上4亿到5亿卢布去建立一所新的涡轮机工厂。
    1956年的计划在专业化方面规定了若干措施，尤其是规定限制工厂生产部件的品种，消除在不同的工厂里制造同类部件这种不合理的重复现象。这首先是指备件、汽车、拖拉机、农业机器、柴油机、涡轮发电机、水力发电机、大型的电力机器、电力变压器、电动机和若干其他类型的装备和机器的生产。
    我们经济机关的本位主义、各部不愿意考虑全国的利益和力
  图把厂际协作“挤入”狭隘的本系统的范围内，结果引起各种各样的不合理现象。这些作法是实行专业化和协作的最凶恶的敌人。这种恶劣的作法应当铲除，越快越好。
    在去年，苏联国家经济委员会同苏联国家计划委员会一道，在地方党组织和苏维埃机关的参加下，全面地检查了西伯利亚东部和远东地区的68个企业的工作，它们这次检查工作是从利用这些企业的生产能力、以及它们的专业化和协作的角度着眼的。这次检查的结果表明，管辖上述企业的部和主管机关在规划它们的工作的时候完全没有考虑到它们的专业化和协作的可能性，也没有考虑到满足附近地区对它们的产品的需要的问题。就这个问题所草拟的建议已经由苏联共产党中央委员会批准，并且就这个建议通过了相应的决议。
    国家经济委员会同国家计划委员会一道，在若干大工业中心和经济地区，首先是列宁格勒和乌拉尔对企业的专业化和协作的现状作了全面检查，并且拟出相应的改进建议。上述工作将帮助我们整顿这方面的工作。
    同时，我们应当按照指示草案的规定，着手草拟发展大工业中心和经济地区的企业的专业化和协作的远景计划。
    我想在增产的重要潜力——节约物资方面说几句话。在第六个五年计划指示草案中，规定了关于节约原料、材料和燃料的重大任务。在五年计划期间，金属的单位消耗量平均至少要降低22％。这一任务的完成与否，直接影响着预定扩大机器制造业和金属加工业产品的生产。只有这样的节约规模才能在钢和钢材产量增加51％到52％的条件下，保证机器制造业和金属加工业产品增加约80％。
    显然，预定的节约指标不能靠单纯紧缩生产产品所需的原料和材料的消耗定额来保证。这是不现实的，只能引起生产上的不平衡并且使预定增产任务不能完成。我们根本不打算紧缩物资供应条件。相反，要保持物资供应上的极大的稳定性，特别是要增加国民经济中短期使用的物资储备。而问题在于，在技术进步以及工艺和生产组织日益完善的基础上用最少的物资消耗来完成五年计划。
    如果我们的设计师和施工员在研究他们产品的最高利用指标的同时，还认真负责地从节约原料和材料的角度来找到最节约的办法，那末节约物资的任务是可以胜利完成和超额完成的。
    在提高各种机械和装备生产率的同时，还要减轻它们的重量和减少它们的体积，这是为了国民经济中生产的进一步增长和节约而应该竭力利用的重要潜力。同时，有充分根据必须在这里指出，国民经济在金属供应方面所遭遇到的个别的困难以及金属使用者的大量浪费金属的现象，在很大程度上是由于钢铁工业部对经济型钢的生产没有给予应有的注意，并且听凭按等级供应金属的计划遭到破坏。
    大家知道，节约燃料在国民经济方面有多么大的意义，但是很多的部对如此重要的事情没有给予必要的注意。这首先是指交通部、电站部、钢铁工业部和建筑材料工业部这些在我国使用燃料最多的部；还有采煤工业部，这个部所供给的煤的品种不合适，很难没有损失地加以利用。
    我们这里把普通煤代替筛选煤或者煤砖供给铁路机车应用。这就使得铁路方面一年浪费1，000万吨煤。已经是要求苏联采煤工业部更快地改变到供应高级煤和煤砖的时候了。
    电力站方面也有可以节约燃料的不少潜力。电站部的电力站掌握新装备极其缓慢。仅仅由于这个原因就使高压电力站每年多烧100万吨标准煤。
    节约物资和合理使用物资，是如此重要的全国性的大事，值得我们一切经济机关和党组织加以注意。
    同志们！第六个五年计划是社会主义经济不断高涨、人民的福利提高、文化和科学繁荣的新的鲜明例证。这一计划得到了我国全体人民一致的拥护。苏联全体人民都充分地相信新的五年计划将像过去的几个五年计划一样顺利地完成。
    伟大的苏联所取得的成就，标志着为人民的福利、为每一个苏联人的幸福和愉快的生活所进行的和平建设性劳动的胜利。这一事实，是我们在社会主义与资本主义两种经济体系的经济竞赛中最强有力的同盟者。在这一事实的影响下，苏联的朋友日益增多。现在不仅是人民民主国家的人民，而且其他国家的人民也都支持我们、同情我们的事业。
    共产党和苏联政府表达了自己的人民以及世界上一切正直的普通人的内心的愿望，过去执行了、今后仍将坚定不移地执行维护世界和平的政策，执行使本国经济繁荣以及与世界上愿意同我们和平相处的一切国家进行和平合作的政策。
    同志们！第六个五年计划体现了千千万万苏联全体人民——共产主义社会的创建者和建设者的愿望。第六个五年计划向伟大的苏联人民展开了我们祖国——世界上第一个取得社会主义胜利的国家——更加富强的新的远景。这些远景鼓舞着苏联人民为共产主义的胜利建立新的劳动功勋。（掌声）
