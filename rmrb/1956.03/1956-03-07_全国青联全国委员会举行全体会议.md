    The Second National Committee of the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth held its third plenary session in Beijing from March 2nd to 5th.

    The meeting discussed the main tasks of the All-China Youth Federation at present and in the future, and adopted a resolution on convening the Third National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation in Beijing in the first half of 1957.

    The meeting believes that the main tasks of youth federations at all levels at present and in the future are to further consolidate and expand the unity of youth of all ethnic groups and from all walks of life, and to mobilize and organize them to actively participate in the struggle for socialist construction and socialist transformation. Among young people in the industrial and commercial sectors, it is necessary to actively organize them to study politics, technology, and culture, participate in various social welfare activities, gradually improve their political consciousness, and cultivate them into self-reliant laborers. At the same time, more progressive elements and core members should be cultivated among young people in the industrial and commercial sectors in the future. At present, the primary task is to do a good job in conveying and implementing the spirit of the National Congress of Young Activists in the Industrial and Commercial Sectors. Among minority youth, it is imperative to vigorously cultivate minority youth cadres. In minority areas that have undergone democratic reforms, it is necessary to actively mobilize minority youth to participate in agricultural cooperativization and the development of agricultural and pastoral production. In areas preparing to implement democratic reforms, efforts should be made to mobilize and launch youth to implement the Party's policies and actively participate in various reform efforts. Youth activities should be launched among all ethnic groups to strengthen the unity and friendship of youth of all ethnic groups. In the work with social youth, it is necessary to further strengthen their socialist ideological education, strive to run senior high school supplementary schools well, mobilize them to actively participate in street work and social welfare activities, pay attention to their labor employment and further education issues, and give full play to their active role in defending and building the motherland. In the future, the Youth Federation should also strengthen youth work among scientific and technical personnel. Youth federations at all levels should vigorously cooperate with the Party and the Communist Youth League organizations to unite all young scientific and technical personnel widely and deeply and march towards science and culture. In addition, youth federations at all levels must also do a good job in uniting young people in religious circles and overseas Chinese youth.

    The meeting pointed out that the Democratic Youth Federation should further strengthen its work in the international united front and better consolidate the unity with democratic youth in various countries around the world.

    Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, made a concluding speech at the meeting.

    会议指出，民主青联还要进一步加强国际统一战线方面的工作，更好地巩固同世界各国民主青年的团结。
