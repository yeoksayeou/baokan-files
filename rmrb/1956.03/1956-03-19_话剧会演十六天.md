Sixteen Days of Drama Festival
Zhu Shulan

The first National Drama Observation and Performance Conference, sponsored by the Ministry of Culture, has seen 21 drama troupes perform 27 plays from March 1st to 16th. Many plays reflect our rich and varied real life in many ways, creating some relatively characteristic positive hero figures, and how they fight against backward and reactionary forces. From these plays, one can more or less feel the strength of the positive forces in the process of socialist revolution. What is exciting is that, in addition to the mature artists of the older generation, a group of energetic new forces has emerged on the drama front.

"Ten Thousand Waters and a Thousand Mountains," which reflects the great feat of the 25,000-li Long March of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Armed Forces, has won high praise from the broad masses of the audience. It can be seen from the play that the author has full revolutionary enthusiasm and artistic talent. He successfully created unforgettable images such as Battalion Instructor Li Youguo and Deputy Battalion Commander Luo Shuncheng, and portrayed the glorious revolutionary historical sites. The actors who played the roles of battalion instructor, deputy battalion commander, and prisoners shaped vivid images. Another popular drama reflecting the revolutionary war is "Growing Up in Battle," which writes about the fate of two generations and the different paths taken by different classes, vividly reflecting the face of the historical era.

In recent years, our industrial production front has made great achievements, but there are not enough good plays reflecting this struggle life. However, it can be seen from the plays that have been performed that playwrights are making efforts in this regard. Multi-act plays such as "Gas Problem," "Yangtze River," "Also Enemies" and "Newly Blooming Flowers" are all against the conservative ideology in industrial construction. The characteristic of "Gas Problem" is that the author attempts to break through the past formula of depicting industrial themes, not entangled in production technology, but depicts the different faces of the old and new societies through the different experiences of two generations of workers. "Yangtze River" writes that in the socialist industrial production organization, relying solely on political enthusiasm and not adopting scientific production methods cannot increase production volume and complete national tasks. The director of this play vividly contrasted the different faces of the two factories.

The multi-act plays reflecting agricultural and flood control struggles performed in the first half of the conference included 4 plays: "The Night Before," "In the Torrent," "The Canal Flows and Flowers Bloom" and "Fight." The author of "The Night Before" attempted to break out of the old framework of writing about the transformation of middle peasants in the agricultural cooperation movement, and described the struggle between two lines in the countryside before the high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement arrived. The script unfolds the struggle of farmers to overcome private ownership through disputes over digging pear tree roots. "In the Torrent" depicts the scene where the cooperative's director only wants to run a business to make money, leaving the fields barren, which arouses dissatisfaction among the mutual aid group members and the masses who come to visit, which is very fresh.

We are a multi-ethnic country, so reflecting the struggle life of fraternal ethnic groups is also one of the important tasks of drama art. "On the Kangbul Grassland" is a collective creation of a group of young drama workers. It praises the party's ethnic policy and the hard work and revolutionary enthusiasm of staff in ethnic minority areas, as well as the brave and simple character of the Tibetan people. This is a play with a strong atmosphere of life and relatively successful characterization. Positive characters such as Work Team Leader Liu, Grandpa Karte, and negative characters such as Daob are all authentic and credible. The author established the characters through dramatic conflicts. The whole play is full of grassland life atmosphere and deeply attracts the audience. The author of "Like Brothers" grasped the subject matter of major conflicts in real life, and boldly revealed the complicated and acute struggles between the people and between ourselves and the enemy under the influence of the great Han chauvinist ideology of individual leading staff in the Hui area. What should be especially welcomed is that the Uyghur and Mongolian ethnic groups used their ethnic languages to perform "Happy Event" and "We Are All Sentinels," which reflect the struggle life of the Uyghur and Mongolian peoples. "Happy Event" depicts the struggle for agricultural socialist transformation in the Uyghur region. Its performance is full of ethnic characteristics and makes people feel cordial. "We Are All Sentinels" shows the victory of the Mongolian people's anti-special struggle. This one-act play is not only very concise, but the characters in the play are also full of ethnic character characteristics. These plays reflecting the struggle life of fraternal ethnic groups are important gains in our drama creation.

Cultivating the younger generation to become successors to the cause of socialist construction is an important responsibility of literary and artistic workers. Writers and artists have gradually attached importance to creating literary and artistic works that serve children and teenagers. "Malan Flower" sings praises of labor and depicts the struggle between good and evil. Adapting fairy tales into children's plays based on folk legends is a new and valuable attempt. Another play reflecting the life of young pioneers, "Friendship," gave children a collective education.

One-act plays are a powerful artistic means to quickly reflect real life and educate the people. Judging from the 12 one-act plays that have been performed, it fully demonstrates the valuable performance of one-act plays. The themes and subject matter of these short plays are diverse. The playwright chose a fragment of life, and reflected the sharp struggle between positive and negative forces in life through the dramatic scenes unfolded by the conflict of characters. Liu Lianying in "Liu Lianying," the old worker Captain Wu in "East and West Tongkou," and Tong Huiyun in "Return" are all advanced figures that we often encounter in our lives. It is such people who are pushing society forward. The district party secretary in "Can't Be Locked Up" and the rich peasant in "Huanghualing" are representatives of the negative forces that hinder the development of our society. These images are all shaped relatively well. "Can't Take That Road," adapted from the novel, has a simple and lovely rural life atmosphere from the script to the performance. The degree of popularity of relatively concise and excellent one-act plays is not less than that of good multi-act plays. People welcome the emergence of more and better one-act plays.

What is very exciting from these performances is the remarkable achievements of many young directors and actors in the art of performance. Most young directors and actors have not received strict professional training. However, they have experienced a certain amount of revolutionary training and artistic practice. They have gone deep into life, are familiar with the people's thoughts and feelings, and have undergone ideological transformation, so their performances are generally full of life atmosphere, which often makes the audience feel very cordial.

Stage art design has also shown great progress in this conference. Better results have been achieved in the production and technical mastery of sets, lighting, costumes, etc.

Although these plays are not all excellent, some plays still have shortcomings in terms of script and other aspects, such as the lack of perfect structure, the lack of sharp conflicts, the shaping of positive characters is still a problem, and the performance lacks the necessary artistic processing, but some of the achievements that have been made still give the audience great excitement and encouragement, and people are beginning to foresee that this is already the eve of the prosperity of drama art.

    话剧会演十六天
    朱树兰
    文化部主办的第一届全国话剧观摩演出会，从3月1日至16日，已经有21个话剧团演出了27个剧目。许多剧目多方面地反映了我们丰富多采的现实生活，创造了一些比较有性格的正面英雄人物，和他们怎样同落后的以及反动的势力作斗争。从这些戏中，或多或少地可以感到社会主义革命进程中的正面力量的强大。令人兴奋的是，除了年长一辈的成熟的艺术家之外，话剧战线上已经涌现出了一群朝气勃勃的新生力量。
    反映我国人民革命武装二万五千里长征伟绩的“万水千山”，博得广大观众的很高的评价。从剧中可以看出作者的饱满的革命热情和艺术才能，他成功地创造了营教导员李有国、副营长罗顺成等令人难忘的形象，刻划了光辉的革命史迹。饰营教导员、副营长、俘虏等角色的演员塑造了鲜明的形象。另一个受欢迎的反映革命战争的话剧是“战斗里成长”，它写出了两代人的命运，和不同阶级所走的不同道路，鲜明地反映了历史时代的面貌。
    几年来，我国工业生产战线上有巨大的成绩，但是反映这一斗争生活的好的剧作还不够多。但是，从已经演出的剧目中可以看出剧作家在这一方面的努力。多幕剧“瓦斯问题”、“扬子江边”、“同样是敌人”和“初开的花朵”等。都是反对工业建设中保守主义思想的。“瓦斯问题”的特点是：作者企图突破过去描写工业题材的套子，不是纠缠在生产技术上，而是通过两代工人不同的遭遇描绘出新旧社会的不同面貌。“扬子江边”写的是在社会主义工业的生产机构里，光凭政治热情，不采取科学的生产方式，是不能提高生产量和完成国家任务的。这个戏的导演，以鲜明的对比手法，突出地表现了两种工厂的不同面貌。
    在会演的上半阶段中演出的反映农业和防汛斗争的多幕剧有4个：“前夜”、“在激流中”、“渠水长流花盛开”和“搏斗”。“前夜”的作者企图脱出写农业合作化运动中中农转变的老框子，描写了在农业合作化运动高潮到来之前农村中两条路线的斗争。剧本通过刨梨树根的纠纷展开了农民怎样克服私有观念的斗争。“在激流中”所描写的合作社社长一心只想跑生意赚钱，把田地荒废了，以致引起来参观的互助组组员和群众不满的场面，是很新鲜的。
    我们是一个多民族的国家，因而反映兄弟民族的斗争生活也是话剧艺术的重要任务之一。“在康布尔草原上”是一群年轻的话剧工作者的集体创作，它歌颂了党的民族政策和民族地区工作人员的艰苦工作和革命热情，以及藏族人民的勇敢、纯朴性格。这是一出具有浓厚的生活气息、人物形象刻划比较成功的戏。正面人物如工作组刘组长、卡尔泰爷爷和反面人物道布等，都是真实可信的。作者是通过戏剧的冲突树立了人物形象。全剧充满草原生活气息，深深地吸引了观众。“如兄如弟”的作者抓住了现实生活中重大冲突的题材，大胆地揭示了在回族地区个别领导工作人员的大民族主义思想影响下，所展开的人民内部的、以及敌我之间的复杂而尖锐的斗争。应该特别欢迎的是：维吾尔族和蒙古族用民族语言演出的反映维、蒙两族人民斗争生活的“喜事”和“我们都是哨兵”。“喜事”描写了维族地区农业社会主义改造的斗争。它的演出富有民族特色，令人感到亲切。“我们都是哨兵”中显出了蒙族人民反特斗争的胜利。这个独幕剧不但很洗练，剧中的人物也是富有民族性格特征的。这些反映兄弟民族斗争生活的剧作，是我们话剧创作中的重要收获。
    培养年轻一代成为社会主义建设事业的接班人，是文学艺术工作者的重要职责。作家、艺术家已经逐渐重视创造为少年儿童服务的文艺作品。“马兰花”歌颂了劳动，描写了善同恶的斗争。根据民间传说改编童话剧，是一个新的、可贵的尝试。另一出反映少年先锋队员生活的剧作“友情”，给了孩子们集体主义的教育。
    独幕剧是迅速反映现实生活、教育人民的有力艺术手段之一。从已经演出的12个独幕剧来看，充分地说明了独幕剧的可贵的性能。这些短剧的主题和题材是多种多样的。剧作者选择了某一生活的片断，通过人物性格的冲突所展开的戏剧场面，反映了生活中正面力量和反面力量的尖锐斗争。像“刘莲英”中的刘莲英、“东西两峒口”中的老工人吴队长、“归来”中的童蕙云是我们生活中经常碰得见的先进人物。就是这样的人们推动着社会的前进。“关不住”中的区委书记、“黄花岭”中的富农是阻碍我们社会向前发展的反面力量的代表。这些形象都是塑造得较好的。根据小说改编的“不能走那条路”从剧本到演出都有着朴实可爱的农村生活气息。比较精练的优秀的独幕剧的受欢迎的程度不在好的多幕剧之下。人们欢迎更多更优秀的独幕剧的出现。
    从这些演出中，令人非常兴奋的是许多青年导演、演员们在表演艺术方面的显著成绩。多数青年导演、演员都没有受过严格的专业训练。但是他们经历了一定的革命锻炼和艺术实践，他们深入生活，熟悉人民的思想感情，经过了思想改造，因此使他们的演出一般地富于生活气息，往往使观众感到十分亲切。
    舞台美术设计，在这次会演中也显示了很大的进步。在布景、灯光、服装等的制作和技术掌握上都有了较好的效果。
    这些剧目虽则并不都是优秀的，有些剧无论在剧本上以及其他方面，都还有缺点，例如缺乏完美的结构，缺乏尖锐的冲突，正面人物的塑造依旧是一个问题，表演缺乏应有的艺术加工，但是已有的一些成绩还是给观众以莫大的兴奋和鼓舞，人们开始预感到这已经是话剧艺术繁荣的前夜。
