Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd. Suzuki Mosaburo, Chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, stated at a press conference held in Osaka on March 1st, criticizing the Hatoyama Cabinet for not working hard to reach an agreement on the early normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations.

Suzuki's remarks were in response to Ichiro Hatoyama's speech on February 29th before the Budget Committee of the House of Councillors of the Diet. At that meeting, Hatoyama Ichiro said: "If the Soviet-Japanese negotiations cannot reach a smooth agreement, I will naturally take responsibility."

In his speech, Suzuki accused the Hatoyama Cabinet of adopting the Liberal Party's negotiation policy in the Soviet-Japanese negotiations in order to achieve the merger of conservative parties. Suzuki said that the Socialist Party must thoroughly pursue Prime Minister Hatoyama's political responsibility. If the Soviet-Japanese negotiations fail to reach an agreement, the Hatoyama Cabinet should resign en masse. If it does not resign, the Socialist Party will propose a motion of no confidence in the Cabinet based on the above reasons.

    铃木表示如果苏日谈判失败，鸠山内阁应该辞职
    新华社2日讯　东京消息：日本社会党主席铃木茂三郎3月1日在大坂举行的记者招待会上发表谈话，指责鸠山内阁不努力促使苏日关系正常化的谈判早日达成协议。
    铃木的谈话是针对鸠山一郎2月29日在国会参议院预算委员会上的发言说的。鸠山一郎在这个会上曾说：“如果日苏谈判不能顺利达成协议，我自然要负责任”。
    铃木在谈话中指责鸠山内阁在苏日谈判问题上，为了实现保守政党合并而采取了自由党的谈判方针。铃木说，社会党一定要对鸠山首相的政治责任进行彻底的追究。如果苏日谈判不能达成协议，鸠山内阁应该实行总辞职。如果不辞职，社会党要根据以上的理由提出不信任内阁案。
