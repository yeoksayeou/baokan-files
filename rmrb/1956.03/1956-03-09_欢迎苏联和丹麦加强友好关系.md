    Welcoming the Strengthening of Friendly Relations between the Soviet Union and Denmark

    The Prime Minister of Denmark and the leaders of the Soviet government recently held friendly talks in Moscow. They frankly exchanged views on the relations between Denmark and the Soviet Union and on general international issues, and both sides expressed their determination to further develop the existing good-neighborly relations between the two countries. The results of the Soviet-Danish talks are undoubtedly welcomed by all who are concerned about peace.

    Although the Soviet Union and Denmark are not contiguous neighbors, as Danish Prime Minister Hansen said, the waves of the Baltic Sea wash both the shores of Denmark and the shores of the Soviet Union. The nature of the relations between the two countries also affects the peace and security of the Nordic region. In particular, at a time when certain international aggressor forces are still trying to provoke relations between Denmark and the Soviet Union in order to turn Denmark into a springboard for attacking the Soviet Union, strengthening the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Denmark is not only in the interests of the peoples of both countries, but also in the interests of the peace and security of the Nordic region.

    The Danish and Soviet peoples have a traditional friendship. The Danish people welcome the Soviet Union's friendly policy towards Denmark, and the Soviet people cherish the Danish people's desire for peace and value the fact that no foreign troops are stationed on Danish territory. At a time when the international situation has significantly eased and relations between the Soviet Union and other Nordic countries are continuously improving, the further strengthening of the existing good-neighborly relations between Denmark and the Soviet Union is completely in line with the development of the situation.

    Both sides of the Danish-Soviet talks agreed that strengthening economic and cultural ties between the two countries is an important way to enhance mutual understanding, and are willing to take positive steps in developing trade and implementing broad cultural cooperation. There is reason to expect that the negotiations on trade issues and other outstanding issues between the two countries, which are scheduled to be held in Copenhagen in the near future, will achieve satisfactory results.

    People also noted with satisfaction that the two sides of the Soviet-Danish talks reached a consensus on some principled issues of strengthening peace. Both sides agreed that expanding contacts between all countries is an important contribution to strengthening understanding between countries. Both sides also fully agreed that relations between countries should be based on the principles of non-interference in internal affairs, respect for national sovereignty, non-aggression, and equal cooperation, and expressed their willingness to strive to resolve pressing international issues such as stopping the expansion of armaments, and to do their utmost to promote the further relaxation of the international situation through international peaceful cooperation. Although there are differences of opinion between the two countries, the expression of consensus on these important principles of international relations cannot but be of great benefit to promoting relations between Denmark and the Soviet Union and promoting the easing of the international situation.

    The Soviet-Danish talks and their results once again prove that the Soviet Union unswervingly pursues a policy of improving relations with all countries, strengthening trust and developing cooperation on the basis of peaceful coexistence; and also prove that the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy is gaining more and more positive responses and support from countries willing to maintain peace. This is also the result of the increasing strength of forces striving for peace and international cooperation in these countries. For example, in Denmark, there is a strong call for the implementation of a peaceful and independent policy. The Soviet-Danish Communiqué not only demonstrates the Soviet Union's good-neighborly spirit, but also reflects the Danish people's will to strive for peace and ease the international situation.

    The Soviet Union's recent improvement of relations with Finland, Norway and other countries has had a positive impact on the situation in the Nordic region. Today, demanding to maintain friendly relations with all countries and avoid being involved in new wars has become a common proposition of the Nordic countries. The strengthening of good-neighborly relations between Denmark and the Soviet Union will undoubtedly further ease the situation in the Nordic region, thereby contributing to the consolidation of world peace.

### 欢迎苏联和丹麦加强友好关系

    欢迎苏联和丹麦加强友好关系
    丹麦首相和苏联政府领袖最近在莫斯科进行了友好的会谈，他们就有关丹麦和苏联两国关系以及一般国际问题坦率地交换了意见，双方表示决心进一步发展两国之间现有的善邻关系。丹苏会谈的结果毫无疑问受到一切关心和平的人们的欢迎。
    苏联和丹麦虽然不是互相接壤的邻国，但是正如丹麦首相汉森所说的，波罗的海的浪涛既冲刷着丹麦的海岸，也冲刷着苏联的海岸。两国之间的关系的好恶，也关系到北欧地区的和平和安全。特别是当某些国际侵略势力仍然极力想挑拨丹麦同苏联之间的关系，以图把丹麦变为进攻苏联的跳板的时候，加强丹苏两国的友好关系，不仅符合于两国人民的利益，也符合于北欧地区的和平和安全的利益。
    丹麦人民和苏联人民有着传统的友谊，丹麦人民欢迎苏联对丹麦的友好政策，苏联人民也珍视丹麦人民要求和平的愿望，并且重视在丹麦本土上没有驻扎外国军队的事实。在今天国际局势已有显著的缓和，苏联和北欧其他国家的关系不断获得改善的情况下，丹苏两国现有的善邻关系的进一步加强更是完全顺合形势的发展。
    丹麦和苏联会谈的双方都一致同意：加强两国之间的经济和文化联系，是增进两国之间的相互谅解的重要途径，并且愿意在发展贸易和实行广泛文化合作方面采取一些积极的步骤。人们有理由期待双方决定在最近期间在哥本哈根举行关于贸易问题以及关于其他有关两国悬案的谈判，会取得圆满的结果。
    人们同时满意地注意到苏联和丹麦会谈双方在加强和平的一些原则问题上取得了一致的意见。双方一致同意，扩大所有国家之间的联系是对加强各国之间的了解的重要贡献。双方也完全同意各国之间的关系应该建立在互不干涉内政、尊重各国主权、互不侵犯和平等合作等原则的基础之上，并表示要努力谋求解决如像停止扩张军备等迫切的国际问题，尽自己的力量用国际和平合作的方法促进国际局势的进一步缓和。两国之间尽管观点有所不同，而在这些重要的国际关系的原则问题上表示了一致的意见，这对于促进丹麦和苏联的关系以及促进国际局势的缓和都不能不有很大的好处。
    苏联和丹麦会谈及其结果再一次证明，苏联坚定不移地奉行在和平共处的基础上同各国改善关系，加强信任和发展合作的政策；同时也证明了苏联的这种和平外交政策正在获得愈来愈多的愿意维持和平的国家的积极响应和支持。这也是这些国家中争取和平和国际合作力量日益增强的结果。例如在丹麦，就有着要求执行和平独立政策的强大呼声。苏联—丹麦公报不仅表现了苏联的善邻精神，而且也反映了丹麦人民争取和平和缓和国际局势的意志。
    苏联不久以前同芬兰、挪威等一些国家改善了关系，已对北欧的局势发生了良好的影响。现在，要求同所有国家保持友好关系和避免被卷入新战争，已成为北欧各国的共同主张。丹苏睦邻关系的加强，无疑将会促使北欧局势进一步趋向缓和，从而有利于巩固世界和平的事业。
