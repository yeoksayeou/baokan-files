Meteorological forecasting work across the country has achieved great success in serving production and construction. In 1955 alone, the Dalian Meteorological Observatory, by issuing timely and accurate forecasts of local weather changes, enabled salt farmers and workers in coastal Liaoning Province to continue production during the rainy season, avoiding many losses from salt being diluted by rain. From January to November 1955, this resulted in an increased national production of more than 150,000 tons of salt and more than 900 tons of mirabilite, worth more than 19 million yuan.

Since strengthening the forecasting of disastrous weather events such as frost and cold waves, meteorological observatories (stations) in various regions have enabled farmers to take timely precautions against natural disasters, ensuring bumper harvests. Yuzhong County in Gansu Province was originally a frost-prone area. The county's meteorological station, based on historical frost conditions, determined a frost prevention period for the entire county. During this period, the local Party and government leading organs organized a widespread mass frost prevention force, transmitting frost forecasts to all parts of the county within one hour. As a result, more than 50% of the cultivated land crops in the county, except in mountainous areas, could generally avoid frost damage, resulting in bumper harvests every year.

The forecasting of strong winds and typhoons in coastal areas has played a significant role in protecting the safe production of fishermen. After hearing a forecast of level 6 strong winds in coastal areas, the Shipu area of Zhejiang Province immediately dispatched boats to bring back more than 100 fishing boats that had gone out to sea, avoiding losses. Meteorological forecasting work has also been of great help to industrial construction, national defense construction, grain storage, shipping, and other work.

    气象预报工作为生产建设服务
    全国各地气象预报工作为生产建设服务取得了很大成绩。1955年仅大连气象台由于及时、准确地发布了当地气象变化的预报，使辽宁省沿海的盐民、盐工在雨季里能进行生产，避免了许多次暴雨化盐的损失。在1955年一到十一月里，为国家增产了十五万多吨盐，九百多吨芒硝，价值人民币一千九百多万元。
    各地气象台（站）自从加强了霜冻、寒潮等灾害性气象预报以后，使各地农民及时预防了自然灾害，保证了丰收。甘肃省榆中县原是一个霜灾区，该县气象站根据历年霜降的情况确定了全县防霜期，每到防霜期，当地党、政领导机关就组织广大群众性的防霜队伍，在一小时内把霜冻预报传到全县各地，这样全县除了山区以外，50％以上的耕地作物一般都可避免霜害，年年得到丰收。
    沿海地区的大风、台风预报工作，对保护渔民安全生产起了很大作用。浙江省石浦地区听到沿海有六级大风的预报以后，立即派船把出海生产的一百多只渔船找回来，没有遭到损失。气象预报工作对工业建设、国防建设、粮食保管、航运等工作都有很大帮助。
