Xinhua News Agency, March 4th — The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued the following statement on March 4, 1956:

    In order to realize the desire for a peaceful resolution of disputes between China and the United States, the Chinese side has made repeated efforts in the Sino-US ambassadorial talks. As early as September 1955, the Chinese side suggested holding a Sino-US foreign ministers' meeting to resolve and alleviate the tense situation in the Taiwan area. The Chinese side also does not object to the US proposal to issue a statement renouncing the use of force. To promote the progress of the talks, the Chinese side has twice proactively put forward draft statements that could be accepted by both sides, and has taken into account the US concerns. However, the US side has consistently insisted in the talks that China recognize the United States' right to individual and collective self-defense in the Taiwan area, and has attempted to include China's internal affairs in the joint statement. Regarding the holding of a Sino-US foreign ministers' meeting, it has adopted an uncertain attitude. This has prevented the Sino-US talks from reaching any agreement on the second item on the agenda.

    The two draft statements proposed by the Chinese side did not include any points that were unacceptable to the US, nor did they propose any preconditions. The draft proposed by the Chinese side on October 27, 1955, stipulated that China and the United States should resolve disputes between the two countries by peaceful means without resorting to threats or force; in order to realize this common desire, a Sino-US foreign ministers' meeting should be held to negotiate the resolution and alleviation of the tense situation in the Taiwan area. Because the US expressed its unwillingness to specifically stipulate the holding of a Sino-US foreign ministers' meeting in a principled statement, the Chinese side proposed a new draft on December 1, stipulating that after the Chinese and US ambassadors declared in the statement the desire of China and the United States to peacefully resolve disputes between them without resorting to force, they would continue talks to seek practical and feasible ways to realize this desire. This new draft statement was proposed after considering the US opinions on the Chinese side's first draft statement. Obviously, if the US truly has the sincerity to peacefully resolve the disputes between China and the United States, then there is no reason why it cannot reach an agreement on this draft statement, and then the two ambassadors can continue talks to seek practical and feasible ways to realize this desire for a peaceful resolution of disputes between the two countries.

    However, in the draft statement proposed by the US side on January 12, 1956, it unreasonably insisted that the United States has the "right to individual and collective self-defense" in the Taiwan area. The US side also claimed in the talks that the US presence in Taiwan was for "self-defense," and that the US military's presence in Taiwan was based on so-called joint defense arrangements. This shows that the so-called right of self-defense proposed by the US in the draft statement is to have China recognize that the US can continue to occupy China's territory of Taiwan and interfere in China's liberation of coastal islands, and to recognize the treaty signed by the US with the Chiang Kai-shek group. This is obviously impossible for the Chinese side to accept.

    The US side also proposed in this draft statement that China and the United States "will not resort to threats or force in the Taiwan area or elsewhere." This is an attempt to use ambiguous wording to confuse the disputes between China and the United States in the Taiwan area with China's internal affairs of exercising sovereignty over Taiwan and the coastal islands. The US side claimed in the talks that the United States does not recognize that China's exercise of sovereignty over Taiwan and the coastal islands is China's internal affair. This further illustrates that the purpose of the US using this ambiguous wording is to interpret China's internal affairs as being included in the scope covered by the Sino-US statement, so as to continue to occupy Taiwan and continue to obstruct China's exercise of sovereignty over Taiwan and the coastal islands. The Chinese side has already stated that China's internal affairs of exercising sovereignty over Taiwan and the coastal islands must be separated from the international disputes between China and the United States in the Taiwan area caused by the US occupation of Taiwan and interference in China's internal affairs. The way China liberates Taiwan and the coastal islands is entirely China's sovereignty and internal affair, and the United States has no right to interfere. Attempting to include China's internal affairs in the Sino-US statement is obviously also impossible for the Chinese side to accept.

    Since the United States has already used force and threats of force against China in the Taiwan area, the Chinese side believes that a Sino-US foreign ministers' meeting must be held to realize the desire for a peaceful resolution of disputes between China and the United States without resorting to force. Although the US side stated that it does not rule out a Sino-US foreign ministers' meeting as a practical and feasible way, it refused to make any affirmative statement regarding the holding of a Sino-US foreign ministers' meeting. Considering the various unreasonable demands insisted upon by the US side in the draft statement, one cannot help but think that the US side's purpose in asking for the issuance of a statement renouncing the use of force is to extract a statement from the Chinese side by deception, and then to indefinitely delay the Sino-US foreign ministers' meeting in order to maintain the status quo of the US occupation of Taiwan and interference in China's liberation of the coastal islands. This is absolutely unacceptable to China.

    The US side claims that the draft statement proposed by the Chinese side on December 1, 1955, did not specifically mention the Taiwan area. However, it should be pointed out that as early as April 1955, during the Asian-African Conference, when Premier Zhou Enlai proposed in Bandung that China and the United States sit down for negotiations, he explicitly stated that the purpose of the negotiations was to negotiate the resolution and alleviation of the tense situation in the Taiwan area. At the same time, this was also the specific provision in the Chinese side's draft statement of October 27 last year. It was only because the US side was only willing to issue a principled statement and did not agree to specifically mention the Sino-US foreign ministers' meeting in the statement that the Chinese side did not specifically mention the disputes between China and the United States in the Taiwan area in the draft of December 1. Just as the US side said that practical and feasible ways do not rule out a Sino-US foreign ministers' meeting, the Sino-US disputes mentioned in the Chinese side's December 1 draft do not exclude the disputes between China and the United States in the Taiwan area.

    The problem now is very clear: if the US side hopes to specifically mention the disputes between China and the United States in the Taiwan area in the statement, then it must agree to specifically stipulate the holding of a Sino-US foreign ministers' meeting in the statement, which is the draft proposed by the Chinese side on October 27. If the US side hopes not to specifically mention the Sino-US foreign ministers' meeting in the statement, then there is no reason to demand that the disputes between China and the United States in the Taiwan area be specifically mentioned in the statement, which is the draft proposed by the Chinese side on December 1. These two drafts include all the points that can be accepted by both sides, and do not include any points that are unacceptable to either side. The US side can choose any one of these two drafts.

    The US occupation of China's territory of Taiwan and interference in China's internal affairs have created a tense situation in the Taiwan area. In order to peacefully resolve this problem, the Chinese side has already made great efforts in the Sino-US ambassadorial talks. However, the US side not only obstructs the reaching of an agreement in the talks, but also intensifies its military activities in the Taiwan area. The Chinese side cannot agree to the long-term delay of the Sino-US ambassadorial talks, and the Chinese side cannot sit idly by while the Sino-US ambassadorial talks are used by the United States as a tool to obstruct China's exercise of sovereignty.

    我国外交部就美国拖延中美会谈发表声明
    不能坐视美国利用中美会谈作为阻挠我国行使主权的工具
    新华社4日讯  中华人民共和国外交部在1956年3月4日发表声明如下：
    为了实现和平解决中美两国间争端的愿望，中国方面在中美两国大使级会谈中作了一再的努力。中国方面早在1955年9月就建议举行中美外长会议，解决和缓和消除台湾地区紧张局势的问题。中国方面也不反对美方提出的关于双方发表放弃使用武力的声明的建议。为了促进会谈的进展，中国方面曾经两次主动地提出了可以为双方所接受的声明草案，并且照顾了美方意见。但是，美国方面在会谈中却一直坚持要求中国声明承认美国在台湾地区有单独和集体自卫权利，并且企图把中国的内政问题也包括在双方声明之内，而对于举行中美外长会议，则采取不肯定的态度。这就使中美会谈在第二项议程上，一直没有能够达成任何协议。
    中国方面两次提出的声明草案没有包括任何美方不能接受之点，更没有提出任何先决条件。中国方面在1955年10月27日提出的草案中规定，中美两国应该用和平方法解决它们两国之间的争端而不诉诸威胁或武力；为了实现这一共同愿望，应该举行中美外长会议，协商解决和缓和消除台湾地区紧张局势的问题。由于美方表示不愿意在原则性的声明中具体规定举行中美外长会议，中国方面才在12月1日又提出了新的草案，规定中美两国大使在声明中美两国和平解决彼此之间的争端而不诉诸武力的愿望后，继续会谈以寻求实现这一愿望的切实可行的途径。这个新的声明草案是在考虑了美国方面对于中国方面的第一个声明草案的意见之后提出的。显然，如果美方真正具有和平解决中美两国之间争端的诚意，那么，就没有任何理由不能就这个声明草案达成协议，然后由两国大使继续会谈以寻求实现这一和平解决两国争端的愿望的切实可行的途径。
    但是，美方在1956年1月12日提出的声明草案中却无理地坚持美国在台湾地区有“单独和集体自卫的权利”。美方并且在会谈中声称，美国在台湾是为了“自卫”，美军驻在台湾是根据所谓共同防御的安排。这就说明了，美方在声明草案中提出的所谓自卫权就是要中国承认美国可以继续霸占中国的领土台湾和干涉中国解放沿海岛屿，承认美国同蒋介石集团签订的条约。这显然是决不可能为中国方面所接受的。
    美方在这一声明草案中还提出，中美两国“将不在台湾地区或其他地方诉诸威胁或武力”。这是企图用含糊的措词把中美两国在台湾地区的争端同中国对台湾和沿海岛屿行使主权的内政问题混淆起来。美方在会谈中声称，美国不承认中国对台湾和沿海岛屿行使主权是中国的内政问题。这就更加说明了，美方使用这种含糊措词的目的就是要把中国的内政问题解释为包括在中美声明所涉及的范围之内，以便继续霸占台湾，继续阻挠中国对台湾和沿海岛屿行使主权。中国方面早已声明，中国对台湾和沿海岛屿行使主权的内政问题必须同由于美国侵占台湾和干涉中国内政而引起的中美在台湾地区的国际争端分别开来。中国用什么方式解放台湾和沿海岛屿完全是中国的主权和内政，美国没有任何权利干涉。企图把中国的内政问题包括在中美两国的声明之内，显然同样是决不可能为中国方面所接受的。
    由于美国在台湾地区对中国已经使用了武力和武力威胁，中国方面认为，必须举行中美外长会议来实现和平解决中美两国之间的争端而不诉诸武力的愿望。美方虽然表示，在切实可行的途径中并不排除中美外长会议，但是对于中美外长会议的举行却拒绝作任何肯定的表示。考虑到美方在声明草案中坚持的种种不合理的要求，这就不能不令人认为，美方要求发表一个放弃使用武力的声明的目的在于从中国方面骗取一个声明，然后长期拖延不开中美外长会议，以便保持美国侵占台湾和干涉中国解放沿海岛屿的现状。这是中国绝对不能同意的。
    美方声称，中国方面在1955年12月1日提出的声明草案没有具体地提到台湾地区。但是，应该指出，早在1955年4月亚非会议期间周恩来总理在万隆提出中美两国坐下来谈判的建议时，就曾经明确地说明谈判的目的是协商解决和缓和消除台湾地区紧张局势的问题。同时，这也是中国方面在去年10月27日的声明草案中的具体规定。只是由于美方仅仅愿意发表一个原则性的声明，不赞成在声明中具体地提到中美外长会议，中国方面才在12月1日的草案中不具体地提到中美两国之间在台湾地区的争端。正如美方说切实可行的途径并不排除中美外长会议一样，中国方面12月1日草案中所提到的中美争端也不排除中美两国之间在台湾地区的争端。
    现在的问题很清楚，如果美方希望在声明中具体提到中美之间在台湾地区的争端，那么，就必须同意在声明中具体规定举行中美外长会议，这就是中国方面在10月27日提出的草案。如果美方希望在声明中不具体提到中美外长会议，那么，也就没有理由要求在声明中具体提出中美之间在台湾地区的争端，这就是中国方面在12月1日提出的草案。这两个草案包括了双方可以接受的各点，而没有包括任何一方所不能接受之点。美方可以在这两个草案中选择任何一个。
    美国侵占中国的领土台湾和干涉中国内政，造成了台湾地区的紧张局势。为了和平解决这一问题，中国方面已经在中美大使级会谈中作了很大的努力。但是，美国方面不仅在会谈中阻挠协议的达成，而且还加紧在台湾地区的军事活动。中国方面不能同意中美大使级会谈长此拖延，中国方面更不能坐视中美大使级会谈被美国利用来作为阻挠中国行使主权的工具。
