Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 13th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles left Jakarta on the morning of March 13th for Bangkok. During his stay in Jakarta, Dulles held talks with President Sukarno, the resigned Prime Minister of the Cabinet, Harahap, Foreign Minister Agung, and Sastroamidjojo, who is organizing the new cabinet.

Before leaving, Dulles held a press conference. One reporter asked him that, if, as he said, the Manila Treaty Organization was a so-called "alliance of free countries," then why was it controlled by the United States?

Dulles denied that the United States controlled the group, but at the same time admitted that the United States played a leading role in this military group. According to his explanation, the reason was that the United States was in a militarily "dominant position." He also emphasized that security issues should not be resolved on a geographical basis, which exposed the ambition of the United States, geographically far from Asia, to interfere in Asian affairs.

Jakarta's "People's Daily" reported on March 13th that when Dulles arrived in Jakarta on the 12th, slogans such as "Dissolve the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization," "Crush the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization," and "Asians Don't Want to Fight Asians" appeared everywhere at the airport. Demonstrators shouted: "Dulles go home!" "We oppose foreign interference!"

Xinhua News Agency, March 14th: Bangkok news: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles left Bangkok for Saigon on March 14th.

During his one-day visit to Bangkok, he held talks with Thai Prime Minister Pibul Songgram and Foreign Minister Wan Waithayakon. According to United Press International, citing "government sources," Dulles discussed with them issues such as U.S. "aid" to Thailand and "further plans" for anti-communism.

    杜勒斯到泰国和西贡进行活动
    据新华社雅加达13日电　美国国务卿杜勒斯在3月13日上午离开雅加达前往曼谷。杜勒斯在雅加达期间曾经和总统苏加诺、已经辞职的内阁总理哈拉哈普、外交部长阿贡和正在组织新内阁的组阁人沙斯特罗阿米佐约举行会谈。
    杜勒斯在临走前举行了记者招待会，有一个记者问他，假如照他所说的，马尼拉条约组织是所谓“自由国家的联盟”，那末为什么它又受美国的控制呢？
    杜勒斯一方面否认美国控制这个集团，但是同时又承认美国在这个军事集团中起着首要的作用，据他解释，理由是因为美国在军事上“居于优势的地位”。他还强调安全问题不应该在地理的基础上加以解决，这就暴露了在地理上远离亚洲的美国干涉亚洲事务的野心。
    雅加达“人民日报”13日报道，杜勒斯在12日到达雅加达的时候，飞机场上到处出现了“解散东南亚条约组织”、“粉碎东南亚条约组织”、“亚洲人不愿意打亚洲人”等标语。示威的人们高呼：“杜勒斯滚回去！”“我们反对外国干涉！”
    新华社14日讯　曼谷消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯在3月14日离开曼谷前往西贡。
    他在曼谷的一天访问期间，曾经同泰国总理銮披汶和外交部长那拉底举行会谈。据合众社援引“接近政府的人士”的话透露，杜勒斯同他们讨论了美国“援助”泰国以及反共的“进一步计划”等问题。
