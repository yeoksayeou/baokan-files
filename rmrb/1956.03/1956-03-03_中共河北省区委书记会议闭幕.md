Xinhua News Agency, March 1st. The CPC Hebei Provincial First District Committee Secretaries Meeting held in Beijing, after 8 days of discussion and exchange of advanced experiences, closed today.

    The Hebei Provincial meeting was held under the care of the Party Central Committee. Peng Zhen, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Nie Rongzhen, a member of the CPC Central Committee, Bo Yibo, and alternate members of the CPC Central Committee Liu Lantao and Wang Congwu attended the meeting. Peng Zhen, Nie Rongzhen, and Bo Yibo all gave reports to the meeting. In his report, Comrade Peng Zhen emphasized that during the high tide of socialist construction and socialist transformation, it is necessary to continue to strengthen the education of peasants, strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, unite all forces that can be united, and adopt methods of treating them differently to thoroughly isolate and eliminate the remaining counter-revolutionaries. He called on everyone to continue to adhere to and carry forward the party's style of humility and prudence, seeking truth from facts, consulting with the masses on everything, and working hard, running cooperatives diligently, and managing the country with diligence and thrift. He said that party organizations at all levels should conscientiously implement the party's democratic centralism, implement collective leadership, and develop criticism and self-criticism. Only by working in this way can we continue to make progress and achieve new and greater achievements.

    Lin Tie, secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPC, made a concluding report at the closing ceremony. He said that the current tasks are extremely arduous, and the spring plowing and sowing season is approaching, and there are many things that need to be done; it is very dangerous to think that everything is easy to handle with the full socialist cooperation, and there is no problem with increasing production, and therefore become arrogant, complacent, relaxed and numb. He pointed out that according to the meeting, many cadres are developing this kind of harmful, blindly optimistic, and everything-is-going-well mood. He pointed out that although the old contradictions have been resolved, new contradictions will still arise, and we should never treat the rectification and consolidation of agricultural cooperatives with a bureaucratic attitude of everything-is-going-well. Our central task in the future is to solve the quality problem of cooperatives, which requires consolidating the cooperatives and truly achieving diligence and thrift in running the cooperatives. The key to consolidating the cooperatives is to do a good job in operation and management and ensure increased production. Then, he explained separately the issues discussed at the meeting regarding production planning, labor planning, and spring plowing production. He pointed out that the production plan of agricultural production cooperatives must be both advanced and reliable, and strive for the possible output according to reliable conditions. Impractical grand plans should be appropriately revised. Doing a good job in labor planning is the central link in consolidating the work of agricultural production cooperatives. It is an urgent task to quickly solve this problem based on existing experience. Regarding the scale of the cooperatives, he pointed out that under the current conditions, it is okay for agricultural production cooperatives to be slightly larger, which is beneficial to increasing production, but being too large is not only inconvenient for leadership but also inconvenient for management. Therefore, at present, it is appropriate to have one cooperative per village or one cooperative per township, that is, about two to three hundred households to about five hundred households, and no further mergers should be made at present. In his report, Lin Tie also especially emphasized the need to do a good job in preparing for spring plowing.

    中共河北省区委书记会议闭幕
    据新华社1日讯　在北京召开的中共河北省第一次区委书记会议，经过8天的讨论和交流先进经验以后，已经在今天闭幕。
    河北省这次会议是在党中央关怀下召开的。中共中央政治局委员彭真、中共中央委员聂荣臻、薄一波和中共中央候补委员刘澜涛、王从吾都曾到会，彭真、聂荣臻和薄一波都向会议做了报告。彭真同志在报告中着重说明了在社会主义建设和社会主义改造高潮中，要结合各种具体事例继续加强对农民的教育，加强工农联盟，并且团结一切可能团结的力量和采用分别对待的办法，彻底地孤立和消灭残余的反革命分子。要求大家继续坚持和发扬党的谦虚谨慎，实事求是，遇事好好和群众商量和艰苦奋斗、勤俭办社、勤俭治国的作风。他说，各级党组织要认真贯彻党的民主集中制，实行集体领导，开展批评和自我批评。只要这样工作就会不断地取得进步和新的更大的成就。
    中共河北省委员会书记林铁在闭幕大会上做了总结报告。他说，当前的任务是异常繁重的，加之春耕播种季节快要到来，需要做的事情很多；如果认为全社会主义合作化了，什么事都好办了，增产没问题了，因而骄傲自满，松懈麻痹起来是十分危险的。他指出，根据会议反映，不少干部正在滋长这种有害的盲目乐观、百事大吉的情绪。他指出：旧的矛盾，虽然解决了，但新的矛盾还会产生，我们绝对不应该以百事大吉的官僚主义态度来对待农业合作社的整顿和巩固工作。我们今后的中心任务是解决合作社的质量问题，这就要把社巩固好，真正做到勤俭办社。而巩固社的关键是搞好经营管理、保证增产。接着他就会议讨论的关于生产规划、劳动规划、春耕生产等问题分别作了说明。他指出：农业生产合作社的生产规划必须是既先进又可靠，要根据可靠的条件，争取可能达到的产量。不切实的大计划，应该加以适当的修订。搞好劳动规划是巩固农业生产合作社工作中的中心环节。迅速根据已有的经验解决这一问题，是当前迫切的任务。关于合作社的规模，他指出，在目前条件下，农业生产合作社稍为大一些，是可以的，对增产是有好处的，但太大了不但不便于领导而且也不便于管理。因此，现在基本上以一个村办一个社或一个乡办一个社，即二、三百户到五百户左右是适宜的，目前一律不要再合并。林铁在报告中还特别强调要做好春耕准备工作。
