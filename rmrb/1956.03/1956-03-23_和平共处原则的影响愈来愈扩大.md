Nepal

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 22nd: According to a report in the "Hindustan Times" on March 21st, Nepalese Prime Minister Acharya said at a public gathering in Kathmandu on March 18th that now is the era of coexistence, and Nepal will seek cooperation from all countries.

This was Acharya's first speech at a public gathering since taking office at the end of January. He assured the people that the government would, according to the declaration of King Mahendra, do its best to hold the Nepalese general election before October next year.

In his speech, he outlined the main tasks facing his government and gave assurances that his government would "eradicate the corruption arising from the continued existence of feudalism," eliminate unemployment, and involve the masses in governing the country.

When talking about Nepal's first five-year plan, Acharya said that "due to the significant response from other friendly countries that have expressed their willingness to assist our development plans," the original cost of 210 million rupees for this plan may increase. However, he warned that no amount of foreign aid would be effective unless the people themselves "cooperate with each other and strive unitedly and harmoniously" for the progress of the country.

Laos

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 21st: Lao news: After more than a month of cabinet crisis, the Lao Kingdom National Assembly on March 21st passed a vote of confidence in the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense of the previous cabinet, Prince Souvanna Phouma of the Progressive Party, as the Prime Minister of the Lao Kingdom Government. Souvanna Phouma also holds the positions of Minister of Foreign Affairs, National Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Information. Former Prime Minister Katay Don Sasorith will serve as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of State.

Before the vote of confidence in the National Assembly, Souvanna Phouma introduced the policies of his new government. He said that he would implement the policies he announced during his previous cabinet formation. At that time, Souvanna Phouma talked about his government's foreign policy of implementing five principles, opposing foreign interference in Laos, and establishing diplomatic relations with all countries, especially neighboring countries.

Philippines

Xinhua News Agency, March 21st: Manila News: The Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Philippine House of Representatives, Mr. Cunco, spoke at a meeting of the House of Representatives on March 15th, advocating for the acceptance of the peace coexistence proposal made by China.

Cunco said that peaceful coexistence can maintain world peace. He firmly believes that China has no intention of invading the Philippines. He said that he is a devout Catholic. There is nothing wrong with Catholics advocating avoiding war with China.

Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd: Manila News: According to the "Manila Chronicle" on March 16th, the former Chairman of the Philippine National Economic Council, Alfredo Montelibano, delivered a public speech on March 15th, calling for a fundamental revision of the Philippines' foreign policy. He said: "We would do well to adopt a foreign policy that is more concerned with our national best interests, rather than relying solely on friendship with the United States."

He also said, "It would be wrong to assume that the United States' policy toward the Philippines stems primarily from considerations of friendship. The United States' policy toward the Philippines stems from considerations of advantage and convenience."

Montelibano said that the Philippines' "friendly and loyal" policy toward the United States has not yielded any positive benefits. He said: "It is extremely reckless to entrust our nation's future to foreigners whose concern for the Philippines cannot extend beyond their own self-interest."

    和平共处原则的影响愈来愈扩大
    尼泊尔
    新华社新德里22日电　据“印度斯坦时报”三月二十一日报道，尼泊尔首相阿查里雅三月十八日在加德满都的一个公众集会上说，现在是共处的时代，尼泊尔将寻求所有国家的合作。
    这是阿查里雅自从一月底就职以来第一次在公众集会上讲话。他向人民保证说，政府将根据国王马亨德拉所宣布的，尽力争取在明年十月以前举行尼泊尔大选。
    他在讲话中提出了他的政府所面临的主要任务，并且提出保证说，他的政府将要“消灭由于封建制度继续存在而产生的贪污”，消灭失业现象，并且使群众参加治理国家。
    阿查里雅在谈到尼泊尔的第一个五年计划的时候说，“由于已经表示愿意援助我们的开发计划的其他友好国家方面的重大的反应”，这个计划原定的两亿一千万卢比的费用可能增加。但是，他提出警告说，除非人民自己互相“合作并且一致而谐和地争取”国家的进步，否则无论多少外援都是无济于事的。
    老挝
    据新华社河内21日电　老挝消息：经过一个多月的内阁危机以后，老挝王国国民议会三月二十一日投信任票通过了上届内阁的副首相兼国防大臣、进步党党员梭发那·富马为老挝王国政府首相。梭发那·富马还兼任外交、国防、伤兵和宣传四部大臣。前首相克特任副首相兼国务大臣。
    梭发那·富马在这次国民议会投信任票以前，曾介绍了他的新政府的政策。他说，他要执行他在前一次组阁时所宣布的政策。梭发那·富马在那次组阁时曾谈到他的政府对外将实行五项原则，反对外国对老挝的干涉，并且和各国、尤其是各邻国建立外交关系。
    菲律宾
    新华社21日讯　马尼拉消息：菲律宾众议院外交委员会主席库恩柯三月十五日在众议院会议上发言，主张接受中国提出的和平共处的建议。
    库恩柯说，和平共处可以维持世界和平。他深信中国并无侵略菲律宾的企图。他说，他是一个虔诚的天主教徒。天主教徒主张避免同中国作战，这并没有任何错误。
    据新华社22日讯　马尼拉消息：据“马尼拉纪事报”三月十六日报道，菲律宾全国经济委员会前任主席艾尔弗雷多·蒙特利班诺十五日发表了一篇公开演说，要求根本修改菲律宾的外交政策。他说：“我们最好是采取一种更关心我们国家的最大利益，而不是纯粹依靠同美国的友谊的外交政策。”
    他又说，“如果认为美国对菲律宾的政策主要是从友谊的考虑出发的，那就错了。美国对菲律宾的政策是从有利和方便的考虑出发的。”
    蒙特利班诺说，菲律宾对美国所采取的“友好和忠诚”政策并没有得到任何肯定的好处。他说：“如果把我们国家的前途付托在对菲律宾的关心不可能超出自己的私利的外国人手中，那是十分冒失的。”
