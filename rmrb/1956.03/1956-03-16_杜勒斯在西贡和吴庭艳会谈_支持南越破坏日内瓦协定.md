    杜勒斯在西贡和吴庭艳会谈
    支持南越破坏日内瓦协定
    新华社河内15日电　西贡消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯14日在西贡和吴庭艳进行了会谈。会谈的结果没有公布。但从西方通讯社的报道看来，杜勒斯和吴庭艳的会谈主要是集中在美国如何支持南越破坏日内瓦协定、拒绝全越普选的阴谋方面。
    据吴庭艳的秘书阮友洲对法新社记者说，杜勒斯重申了美国对南越政策的支持。据美联社援引“可靠人士”的话透露，杜勒斯和吴庭艳一致同意不按照日内瓦协定的规定在今年7月举行全越南的普选。杜勒斯向吴庭艳保证不削减美国对南越的军事和非军事的援助。杜勒斯还告诉吴庭艳说，东南亚条约组织国家仍然认为南越是在它们的“保护”之下。
    杜勒斯已经在15日离开西贡到达马尼拉，继续他在远东的访问活动。
