    Maintaining the Implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam

    The fifth working report of the International Commission in Vietnam, published today, emphasizes that the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam continues to face serious obstacles because South Vietnam continues to refuse to abide by the Accords. The International Commission has once again brought this issue to the attention of the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference and all participating countries for a prompt solution.

    Broad international public opinion supports the International Commission's position that all parties concerned must take effective steps quickly to maintain the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam. China, Poland, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Soviet Union have successively proposed reconvening the Geneva Conference. However, at this time, the United States has held military exercises in areas adjacent to Vietnam, convened meetings of the Manila Treaty Organization, and even openly stated that "the United States considers the Geneva Accords unsuitable in many respects" and that "the United States is not prepared to assume any responsibility under the Geneva Accords." On March 14, Dulles personally went to Saigon to jointly determine with Ngo Dinh Diem the policy of continuing to oppose free nationwide elections in Vietnam. He also assured that the United States would provide military assistance to South Vietnam in any Indochina "crisis" arising therefrom, thereby encouraging and emboldening the Ngo Dinh Diem group to more recklessly undermine the Geneva Accords. Under the direction and support of the United States, South Vietnam staged the farce of "separate elections" on March 4 and has intensified its obstruction of the International Commission's work in South Vietnam. In recent months, all international mobile teams dispatched to South Vietnam to investigate the continuous persecution of former resistance members have been unable to begin their investigations. The International Commission's fixed teams stationed in various parts of South Vietnam have also encountered a new series of difficulties in supervising South Vietnam's prevention of the entry of reinforcing military personnel and war materials. Obviously, the aim of the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem group is to wreck the Geneva Accords, permanently divide Vietnam, and completely turn South Vietnam into a military outpost of the United States in the Indochina region.

    Recently, it has been noted that British Foreign Secretary Lloyd has repeatedly stated that "the Geneva Accords must be implemented" and emphasized that "we must be very certain to maintain peace in Indochina." French Foreign Minister Pineau recently also mentioned that "France hopes that the terms of the Geneva Accords will be fully implemented." He specifically mentioned that "France continues to support holding free general elections throughout North and South Vietnam in July 1956, in accordance with the Geneva Accords." These are all welcome. However, an argument has emerged from certain British and French newspapers and news agencies that the main problem at present is how to maintain the Geneva Accords on the premise of affirming that free nationwide elections in Vietnam are impossible to achieve. It should be pointed out to the promoters of this argument that the Geneva Accords are an integral whole, and the provisions concerning Vietnam's restoration of its unity through free nationwide elections are an inseparable part of this agreement. The implementation of the various provisions of the Geneva Accords concerning the cessation of hostilities is precisely to "create the necessary preconditions for achieving a political settlement in Vietnam in the near future," and a political settlement in Vietnam is a necessary condition for consolidating peace in Vietnam and Indochina. Indian President Prasad recently pointed out that the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference and other relevant countries should not only "do their utmost to maintain the armistice agreement, but also do their utmost to promote a genuine political settlement, which will contribute to the happiness of those countries and to the attainment of security in Asia, and will eliminate the threat of conflicts whose scope is not easily foreseen"; this is entirely correct.

    The Chinese people believe that the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference should meet as soon as possible to arrange for the convening of a conference of the participating countries of the Geneva Conference and the member countries of the Vietnam International Commission to seek practical and effective ways to ensure the realization of free nationwide elections in Vietnam, to guarantee all necessary working conditions for the Vietnam International Commission, and to maintain the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam.

### 维护日内瓦协议在越南的实施

    维护日内瓦协议在越南的实施
    今天公布的越南国际委员会第五次工作报告强调指出，由于南越仍然拒绝遵守日内瓦协议，这一协议在越南的实施正继续遭到严重的障碍。国际委员会已经再一次把这个问题提请日内瓦会议两位主席和所有参加国迅速加以解决。
    广大国际舆论都支持国际委员会的主张，认为一切有关方面必须迅速采取有效步骤，来维护日内瓦协议在越南的实施。中国、波兰、越南民主共和国和苏联已经先后提出重新召开日内瓦会议的建议。但是，就在这个时候，美国在邻近越南的地区举行了军事演习，召开了马尼拉条约组织的会议，甚至公开声称“美国认为日内瓦协议在许多方面是不适宜的”，“美国不准备根据日内瓦协议负任何责任”。三月十四日，杜勒斯还亲自前往西贡，同吴庭艳一道确定了继续反对越南全国自由选举的方针。他还保证美国将在因此而引起的任何印度支那“危机”中对南越提供武力援助，以此来怂恿和鼓励吴庭艳集团更放手地破坏日内瓦协议。在美国的指使和支持之下，南越在三月四日上演了“单独选举”的丑剧，而且变本加厉地阻挠国际委员会在南越的工作。这几个月来，所有奉派前往南越调查不断发生的迫害前抗战人员事件的国际机动小组，都没有能开始调查工作。分驻在南越各地的国际委员会固定小组，也在监督南越不得进入增援性军事人员和作战物资方面，遭遇到新的一系列的困难。很显然，美国和吴庭艳集团的目的就是要搞垮日内瓦协议，长期分裂越南，并把南越完全变成美国在印度支那地区的一个军事前哨。
    最近，人们注意到，英国外交大臣劳埃德曾一再表示，“日内瓦协议必须执行”，并且强调“我们必须十分肯定地在印度支那保持着和平”。法国外交部长比诺最近也提到，“法国希望日内瓦协议的条款得到完全的履行”。他还特别提到，“法国继续赞成按照日内瓦协议在1956年7月在南北越全境举行普选”。这都是值得欢迎的。但是，从英国和法国的某些报刊和通讯社却传出一种论调，认为目前的主要问题是，如何在肯定越南全国自由选举不可能实现的前提下保持日内瓦协议。应该对这种论调的鼓吹者指出，日内瓦协议是一个整体，而有关越南经由全国自由选举恢复其统一的规定，是这个协议的不可分割的一部分。实施日内瓦协议中有关停止敌对行动的各项条款，也就是为了要“造成在最近时期内实现越南政治解决的必要前提”，而越南的政治解决，又是巩固越南和印度支那和平的必要条件。印度普拉沙德总统最近曾经指出，日内瓦会议的两位主席和其他有关国家不但应该“尽全力维持停战协定，而且尽全力促进真正的政治解决，这种政治解决将有助于那些国家幸福和亚洲获致安全，并且将消除范围不容易预见的冲突的威胁”；这是完全正确的。
    中国人民认为，日内瓦会议两位主席应该尽速会晤，安排召集日内瓦会议参加国和越南国际委员会的委员国举行会议，寻求切实有效的办法来保证越南全国自由选举的实现，保障越南国际委员会一切必要的工作条件，维护日内瓦协议在越南的实施。
