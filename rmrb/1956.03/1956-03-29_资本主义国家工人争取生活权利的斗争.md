Workers in Capitalist Countries Struggle for the Right to Live

Japanese Coal Miners Continue Indefinite Strike

Part of the coal miners from thirteen major coal mining companies, including Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo in Japan, launched an indefinite strike simultaneously in fifty-four coal mines across the country on March 19th to protest against the suppression by the capitalists and resolutely demand an increase in their meager wages. Currently, the strike struggle of Japanese coal miners demanding wage increases is expanding from large companies to small and medium-sized companies. On the 26th, workers from nine small and medium-sized coal mining companies held their first 24-hour strike in eleven coal mines.

On March 22nd, the official Central Labor Relations Commission proposed a mediation plan accepted by the capitalists. The coal miners' union believed that, given the financial situation of the coal mining companies, the mediation plan was unsatisfactory and therefore decided to reject it and continue the strike.

On the 26th, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) held a meeting of its executive committee, deciding to raise 150 million yen and 3,000 koku of rice to support the coal miners' struggle.

US Electrical Company Workers Win Strike

The strike of 44,000 workers at the Westinghouse Electric Company, which began in mid-October last year, ended victoriously on March 20th. According to American news agencies, this strike, which lasted 156 days, was the longest strike in the United States in more than 20 years.

The reason for the strike was the workers' demand for a reasonable contract, higher wages, and improved working conditions. The workers of Westinghouse Electric Company, with the support of workers in other industries and the general public, bravely persisted, finally forcing the capitalists to make concessions. According to the new contract signed by both parties, workers' hourly wages will increase by 5 to 17 cents, and workers' welfare benefits will be improved.

Workers in Aden Persist in Strike Struggle

A series of strikes have paralyzed Aden, the British colony on the Red Sea. Currently, strikes by workers in various industries are continuing.

Five thousand workers at the Aden refinery went on strike on March 20th, demanding higher wages, holiday leave, working according to union-stipulated hours, and revision of the company's housing rent schedule. Workers at Aden Airways, taxi drivers, and bus workers have also gone on strike. Schools have been closed.

Police used tear gas against mass demonstrations.

    资本主义国家工人争取生活权利的斗争
    日本煤矿工人继续无限期罢工
    日本三井、三菱、住友等十三家大煤矿公司的部分煤矿工人，三月十九日在全国五十四个煤矿一齐举行无限期罢工，反对资方的镇压活动，坚决要求提高他们的低微的工资。目前，日本煤矿工人要求提高工资的罢工斗争，正在从大公司扩展到中小公司。二十六日，九家中小煤矿公司的工人在十一个煤矿举行了第一次24小时罢工。
    三月二十二日，官方的中央劳动委员会曾经提出了一个为资方所接受的调停方案，煤矿工会认为，从煤矿公司的财政情况来看，调停方案是不能令人满意的，因此决定拒绝接受，继续罢工。
    日本工会总评议会在二十六日举行干事会会议，决定要募集捐款一亿五千万日元和大米三千日石，支援煤矿工人的斗争。
  美国一电气公司工人罢工胜利
    从去年十月中旬开始的威斯汀豪斯电气公司四万四千名工人的罢工已经在三月二十日胜利结束。据美国通讯社说，这个前后坚持了一百五十六天的罢工是美国二十多年来历时最久的一次罢工。
    罢工的原因是工人要求签订合理的合同，提高工人工资和改善工作条件。威斯汀豪斯电气公司的工人在其他行业的工人和广大社会人士的支持下英勇地坚持着，最后迫使资方不得不作出让步。根据双方签订的新合同，工人每小时的工资将提高五分到一角七分美元，并且要改善工人的福利待遇。
    亚丁各业工人坚持罢工斗争
    一系列的罢工已经使红海口的英国殖民地亚丁陷于瘫痪状态。目前各业工人的罢工还在继续进行中。
    亚丁的炼油厂的五千个工人在三月二十日举行了罢工，要求提高工资、给工人节日休假、按照工会规定的工时作工、修改公司房屋的租费价目表等。亚丁航空公司的工人、出租汽车司机和公共汽车工人也举行了罢工。学校已经停课。
