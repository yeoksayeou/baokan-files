The Third National Congress of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang
Letter to Military and Political Personnel in Taiwan

Military and political personnel in Taiwan:

Our Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang is holding its Third National Congress in our capital, Beijing. The delegates present are discussing with unparalleled excitement and concentration how to better and faster strive to build our great motherland.

In the meeting hall, with the two great portraits of Mr. Sun Yat-sen and Chairman Mao Zedong hanging high, there are many old comrades with white hair and energetic spirits who followed Mr. Sun Yat-sen for decades, many former military and political personnel of the Nanjing and Chongqing governments, as well as generals who participated in the Northern Expedition, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the peaceful uprising during the Liberation War, and also comrades who lived overseas and recently returned to the motherland. Everyone is invigorated by the growing prosperity and happiness of their motherland and feels heartfelt joy for the opportunity to reminisce, welcome newcomers, and unite closely. But as we gather together, we cannot help but think of the 8 million compatriots in Taiwan and of you who fled from the mainland to Taiwan a few years ago.

We and you originally belonged to the Chinese Kuomintang founded by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. In the past years, some of us and you have shared hardships in the patriotic revolutionary cause, and some have shared life and death on the battlefield against aggression, but later we separated midway. We adhere to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary spirit, abide by Mr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy of "seeking freedom and equality for China," and on the vast territory of the motherland, together with 600 million compatriots, we are striving for the glorious cause of opposing aggression, defending peace, and building a new country, living a life of family reunion, peace, and happiness; while you, however, have fled to Taiwan, are under the military control of American aggressors, cannot obtain a free and peaceful life, and cannot return to the embrace of your own motherland. This is the stark difference between our situation and yours.

However, despite the different situations, whether on the mainland or in Taiwan, we are all children of the same ancestors of the Chinese nation, and we should all love our motherland. In the years that you have left your loved ones, abandoned your homeland, and turned your back on your motherland, our motherland has undergone a tremendous transformation, with vibrant rivers and mountains, and a renewal of everything. It is truly like heaven and earth compared to the ravaged and impoverished situation before you left. In our new country, the lives of workers and peasants are becoming increasingly prosperous, industry and commerce are flourishing, and the abilities and wisdom of state personnel and the vast number of intellectuals can be fully utilized. The ancient saying that "the old will be cared for until their death, the strong will be employed, the young will be nurtured, and the widowed, orphaned, and disabled will all be provided for" will not be empty words in our country; and the difficulty of Shu Road and the clearing of the Yellow River are no longer dreams. The country is so beautiful, would you rather live a life of increasingly narrow roads and increasingly depressed spirits, instead of returning to your lovely motherland?

We firmly believe that the 8 million compatriots in Taiwan are absolutely unwilling to be trapped in deep water and scorching fire, hunger and poverty, and we also hope that you will no longer rely on the fences of foreign forces. The main reason for separating the Taiwan compatriots from their motherland is that the United States uses force to occupy our territory and interfere in our internal affairs, turning Taiwan into its military base. American imperialism attempts to permanently occupy the land of Taiwan and enslave the people of Taiwan, which the Chinese people absolutely cannot allow. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan! When necessary, we will use war to liberate Taiwan, and the Chinese people have the strength to do so; liberating Taiwan peacefully is what we strive for; and no matter what method is used, Taiwan will eventually return to the motherland. In the international situation where people all over the world are united in opposing aggression and more and more countries are firmly demanding peace, do not pin your hopes on the illusion of "a major war breaking out one day"! If the imperialist aggressors dare to launch a world war, then it is they who will be eliminated, and it is you who will be sacrificed! Do not hesitate and wait any longer, attempting to prolong your life! Foreign forces that only want to use Taiwan as a base for aggression are by no means a truly reliable Great Wall, and the resentment and resistance of the Taiwan people cannot be suppressed for long, especially since the internal contradictions within the Taiwan ruling circles are becoming deeper and deeper, with suspicion and infighting, and everyone is in danger; the end is near, and disintegration is imminent; don't you know this deeply? If you do not arouse your conscience and seek a way out early, then you will only fail with others, be sacrificed by others, and regret it endlessly!

Recently, Premier Zhou Enlai's solemn and sincere declaration on the liberation of Taiwan should have been heard by you. As long as you are aware, make up your minds, and together with the people of the motherland and the compatriots in Taiwan, take on the responsibility of liberating Taiwan, this patriotic cause, you can perform meritorious service for the country. In our Liberation War, many of your familiar military and civilian personnel who revolted have been highly valued by the state and are shouldering important positions. In recent years, people who have returned from Taiwan after uprising have been warmly welcomed by the people. These are all brilliant examples that you should learn from.

You are blinded by prejudice and misled by rumors, and you cannot correctly understand the Chinese Communist Party, nor do you understand our democratic parties; but you can recall: How did Mr. Sun Yat-sen cooperate with the Communist Party and strengthen the Kuomintang? And how did the Kuomintang later win the victory of the Northern Expedition because of its cooperation with the Communist Party? Later, how did the united resistance against Japan through cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party save the country from destruction and defeat Japanese imperialism? You can also recall: How have those who have been so-called "anti-communist to the end" fallen into the abyss of failure one after another in the past 30 years? One of the main reasons why the Chinese Communist Party has been able to lead all ethnic groups and classes in China to jointly achieve revolutionary victory and establish a glorious and great new China is that it can unite all patriotic forces. The comrades of our Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and the comrades of the democratic parties are closely united around the Chinese Communist Party, working together with one heart and one mind, sincerely cooperating, deliberating on state affairs, participating in the government, participating in the formulation of the Constitution unanimously supported by the people of the whole country, and holding various positions in the central or local governments. They can all work actively and diligently, and live freely and happily. We have contributed our strength and played our due role in national affairs and international influence. Who can deny these facts!

Our Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang is expanding unity and widely contacting former Kuomintang personnel and people who have historical ties with the former Kuomintang so that everyone can jointly participate in the cause of defending peace and building the motherland. Because of past historical relations, we are concerned about your future and issue a righteous call to you:

Awake! People who have abandoned their motherland and are living under the roof of others! The country is generous to you. As long as you resolutely oppose American imperialism, take the lead in uprising, and join the people, and do your best for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and the complete unification of the motherland, you will be transformed from enemies into friends, and your past misdeeds will not be investigated.

Come back! People who have abandoned their loved ones and left their homeland! Your hometown has a warm life, and your loved ones are waiting earnestly; as long as you are not willing to wander for life and be buried in a foreign land, then Taiwan and the mainland are only separated by a sea, and there is no way to open navigation.

People who once supported Mr. Sun Yat-sen! Mr. Sun Yat-sen's lifelong ideals have been fully realized in our motherland, and the Chinese people will always commemorate the great patriotic revolutionary mentor. The Sun Yat-sen Hall in Biyun Temple in Beijing has been renovated; the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing stands majestically. If you also commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen, you should come back as soon as possible and join us in sweeping the tomb in spring and autumn.

Military and political personnel in Taiwan! Everyone has a sense of right and wrong; who is not patriotic and homesick? Abandoning the dark and turning to the light is the shore! The past cannot be changed, but the future can be pursued! The motherland is calling you, the banner of patriotism is flying in front of you, will you be the master of your own country or a slave to others? Will you take the road to life or the road to death? It is just a matter of a single thought! For the country and for yourselves, you should make a decisive decision!

February 29, 1956, Beijing

### 中国国民党革命委员会第三届全国代表大会  告台湾军政人员书

    中国国民党革命委员会第三届全国代表大会
    告台湾军政人员书台湾的军政人员们：
    我们中国国民党革命委员会正在我国首都北京举行第三届全国代表大会，到会的代表们都以无比兴奋的心情，聚精会神讨论如何更好、更快地为建设我们伟大的祖国而努力。
    在高悬着孙中山先生和毛泽东主席两个伟大肖像的会场上，有多少曾经追随中山先生几十年白发苍髯而精神健旺的老同志，有多少过去南京、重庆政府的军政人员，还有多少参加过北伐战争、抗日战争、以及在解放战争中和平起义的将领，也还有侨居海外不久以前才回到祖国的同志。大家都为了自己祖国的日益富强康乐而精神振奋，都为了能够叙旧迎新亲密团结而衷心快慰。可是在我们欢聚一堂的时候，不能不想起台湾的800万同胞，也不能不想起几年前从大陆上跑到台湾去的你们。
    我们和你们，原先都是属于孙中山先生手创的中国国民党的。在过去的岁月中，我们和你们之间有的人曾在爱国的革命事业中共过患难，有的人曾在反抗侵略的战场上同过生死，可是后来就中道分离了。我们坚持中山先生的革命精神，遵守着中山先生 “求中国之自由平等”的遗教，在辽阔广大的祖国大陆上，和6万万同胞一起，努力于反对侵略、保卫和平和建设新国家的光荣事业，过着亲朋团聚、和平幸福的生活；而你们呢，却跑到台湾，受着美国侵略者的武力控制，得不到自由安乐的生活，回不到自己祖国的怀抱，这就是我们和你们之间迥然不同的处境。
    然而处境尽管不同，无论在大陆、在台湾，总都是中华民族同一祖先的儿女，总应当爱自己的祖国。在你们离开亲人，抛弃乡土，背离祖国的几年中，我们的祖国已经是河山生色，万象更新，和你们离开以前的那种疮痍满目，民不聊生的情况，真是判若天壤。在我们新的国家里，工人农民的生活日益富裕，工商业日趋繁荣，国家工作人员和广大知识分子的能力和智慧可以充分发挥，古人所说的“老有所终，壮有所用，幼有所长，矜寡孤独废疾者皆有所养”，在我们国家里将不是一句空话；而蜀道通，黄河清，已经不是梦想。国家是这样的美好，难道你们宁愿过着那样道路越来越狭窄、精神越来越苦闷的生活，而反不愿意回到自己可爱的祖国来吗？
    我们深信台湾800万同胞绝不甘心陷身于水深火热、饥饿贫困之中，我们也希望你们能不再寄身于外国势力的藩篱之下。把台湾同胞隔断在自己祖国之外，主要是由于美国使用武力侵占我国的领土，干涉我国的内政，把台湾变成了它的军事基地。美帝国主义企图永远霸占台湾土地，奴役台湾人民，这是中国人民绝对不能容许的。中国人民一定要解放台湾！在必要的时候用战争的方式解放台湾，中国人民是有力量的；用和平方式解放台湾，是我们要争取的；而无论通过什么方式，台湾最后必然归还祖国。在全世界人民一致反对侵略、越来越多的国家坚决要求和平的国际局势下，你们不要把自己的命运寄托在什么“一朝大战爆发起来”的幻想上吧！如果帝国主义侵略者敢于掀起世界战争，那么被消灭的是他们，被牺牲的是你们！你们不要再迟疑观望企图苟延残喘吧！只想利用台湾地方以进行侵略的外国势力绝不是真正可以依靠的长城，台湾人民的怨恨和反抗绝不能长期压制，特别是台湾统治内部的矛盾越来越深，猜疑倾轧，人人自危；日暮途穷，分崩可待；你们自己还不深深的知道吗？如果你们还不激发良心，早寻生路，那就只有跟人失败，被人牺牲，悔恨无穷！
    近来周恩来总理关于解放台湾的庄严而恳切的宣告，你们应该是听见了的。只要你们有觉悟，下决心，和祖国人民、台湾同胞共同负起解放台湾这一爱国事业的责任，你们就可以为祖国立功。在我们解放战争中，有多少你们熟识的文武起义人员都得到国家的倚重，担负着重要的职务。近年来从台湾起义归来的人，都得到人民的热烈欢迎。这都是你们应当学习的光辉榜样。
    你们蔽于成见，惑于谣言，对于中国共产党不能正确认识，对于我们民主党派也不了解；然而你们可以回想：孙中山先生是怎样和共产党合作而加强了国民党？以后国民党又是怎样由于和共产党合作而获得了北伐的胜利？以后，又是怎样由于国共合作团结抗战而免于国家的灭亡，战胜了日本帝国主义？你们还可以回想：30年来所谓“反共到底”的人又是怎样先后跌下了失败的深渊？中国共产党之所以能领导全中国各民族、各阶级共同取得革命的胜利，建立了一个辉煌伟大的新中国，主要原因之一就是能团结一切爱国的力量。我们中国国民党革命委员会的同志们和各民主党派的同志们紧紧团结在中国共产党的周围，同心同德，精诚合作，协商国事，参加政权，参与制定全国人民所一致拥护的宪法，担任中央或地方政府的各种职务，都能积极勤劳地工作，自由愉快地生活，我们贡献了自己的力量，在国家的事务中和国际影响上起了应有的作用。这些事实，谁能否认！
    我们中国国民党革命委员会正在扩大团结、广泛联系原国民党及与原国民党有历史关系的人士，使大家能够共同参加保卫和平和建设祖国的事业。由于过去的历史关系，我们关怀着你们的前途，向你们提出正义的号召：
    觉悟吧！抛弃祖国、寄人篱下的人们！国家对你们是宽大的。只要你们毅然决然反对美帝国主义，争先起义，投向人民，为和平解放台湾实现祖国的完全统一而尽力，就对你们化敌为友，既往不究。
    回来吧！抛弃亲人远离故土的人们！自己的家乡有温暖的生活，自己的亲人在殷切盼望；只要你们还不愿意终身流落，埋骨他乡，那么台湾和大陆不过一海之隔，并不是通航无路。
    曾经拥护过孙中山先生的人们！中山先生生前的理想在我们祖国里，已经完全实现，中国人民永远纪念着伟大的爱国主义的革命导师。北京的碧云寺中山堂，修建一新；南京的中山陵，巍然在望。如果你们也还纪念着中山先生，你们就应当及早回来，和我们一同去春秋祭扫。
    台湾的军政人员们！是非之心，人皆有之；爱国思乡，谁独不然？弃暗投明，回头是岸！往者不谏，来者可追！祖国向你们召唤，爱国主义旗帜在你们面前飘扬，做自己国家的主人还是做别人的奴隶？走生路还是走死路？就在一念之间！为国家、为自己，你们应该当机立断！
    1956年2月29日  北京
