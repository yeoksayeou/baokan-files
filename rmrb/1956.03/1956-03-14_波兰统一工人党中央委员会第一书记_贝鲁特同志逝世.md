Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 13th: Polish News Agency, Warsaw, March 13th: Announcement to all working people and the Polish people from the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, the State Council of the Polish People's Republic, and the government.

The Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, the State Council of the Polish People's Republic, and the government announce with extreme grief to the people of the entire country—our workers, peasants, intellectuals, and youth—that Comrade Bolesław Bierut, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, passed away in Moscow on March 12th at 9:30 PM (Warsaw time) after a serious illness.

This is a major loss for the Polish working class, all working people, and the people of the entire country. Comrade Bierut fought staunchly for the cause of the Polish working class. He was a loyal son of all working people, and throughout his life, from his youth, he fought for the freedom and bright future of the people of the entire country.

As a young printing worker, he joined the ranks of socialist fighters. He was tempered into a leader of the left-wing Polish Socialist Party in the struggle against the Tsarist partitioners and against the German and Austrian invaders. He joined the Communist Party of Poland at the time of its founding. During the years between the two world wars, undeterred by persecution and repeated imprisonments, he enthusiastically and wholeheartedly organized workers and working peasants, intellectuals, and youth to fight against the rule of the bourgeoisie and landlords, for bread and work, for democratic rights, for peace and the people's regime. As an activist in the international working class movement, he participated in the revolutionary battles waged by fraternal parties.

In the days of our people's most intense struggle against the Nazi invaders, Comrade Bierut's name (Tomasz) is inextricably linked to the heroic history of the Polish Workers' Party, and he was one of the founders of the Polish Workers' Party. Comrade Tomasz was the organizer and chairman of the People's Representative Council, the first democratic representative body of the Polish people in their struggle for national and social liberation.

The years of People's Poland are inextricably linked to the name of Comrade Bierut, who served as President, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Chairman of the Presidium of the All-Poland Committee of the National Front, and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party. The Polish people will remember Comrade Bierut as a fighter for strengthening the people's regime, a fighter for establishing Poland's borders on the Oder and Neisse rivers, a fighter for the unity of the working class movement on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, a fighter for the reconstruction of the country, a fighter for promoting our country's economy and culture, a fighter for raising Poland's position in the world, and a fighter for building socialism.

He was a passionate patriot, a defender of the fraternal friendship between People's Poland and the Soviet Union and all socialist countries, a defender of the international solidarity of the working people, and an enthusiastic fighter for peace and international friendship.

The working class and the people of the entire country know him as an outstanding leader of the Party—the guide of their labor and struggle, and the Party he served until his last moment—and as a tireless fighter for communism.

Respects to his soul!

    波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记
    贝鲁特同志逝世
    新华社华沙13日电　波兰通讯社华沙13日电：波兰统一工人党中央委员会、波兰人民共和国国务委员会和政府对全体劳动人民和波兰人民的公告。
    波兰统一工人党中央委员会、波兰人民共和国国务委员会和政府怀着极其悲痛的心情报告全国人民——我国工人、农民、知识分子和青年——波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记波莱斯瓦夫·贝鲁特在重病之后于3月12日下午9点30分（华沙时间）在莫斯科逝世。
    这是波兰工人阶级、全体劳动人民和全国人民的重大损失。贝鲁特同志为波兰工人阶级的事业进行了顽强的斗争，他是全体劳动人民忠实的儿子，他从青年时代起的整个一生中为全国人民的自由和美好将来进行了斗争。
    他作为一个青年印刷工人参加了社会主义事业战士的行列。他在反对沙皇瓜分分子、反对德奥侵略者的斗争中锻炼成为左翼波兰社会党的一个领袖。他在波兰共产党成立的时候就参加了波兰共产党。他在两次世界大战中间的年月中，不为迫害和历次徒刑所屈，热诚和竭尽全力地组织了工人和劳动农民、知识分子和青年进行反对资产阶级和地主的统治、争取面包和工作、争取民主权利、争取和平和人民政权的斗争。作为国际工人阶级运动的活动家，他参加了兄弟党所进行的革命战斗。
    在我国人民进行反对纳粹侵略者的最激烈的斗争的日子里，贝鲁特同志的名字（托马兹）是同波兰工人党的英勇历史不可分割地联在一起的，他是波兰工人党的创始人之一。托马兹同志是波兰人民为国家和社会解放而斗争的第一个民主的代表机构——人民代表会议的组织者和主席。
    人民波兰的年代是同贝鲁特同志的名字不可分割地联在一起的，他担任过总统，部长会议主席，全国阵线全波委员会主席团主席，波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记。波兰人民将牢记贝鲁特同志这位争取加强人民政权的战士，争取在奥得河和尼斯河上建立波兰的边界的战士，争取工人阶级运动在马克思列宁主义基础上的统一的战士，为重建国家而斗争的战士，为促进我们国家的经济和文化而斗争的战士，争取提高波兰在世界上的地位的战士和建设社会主义的战士。
    他是一位热诚的爱国者，也是人民波兰同苏联和一切社会主义国家之间的兄弟友谊的维护者，劳动人民国际团结的维护者，争取和平和国际友谊的热情战士。
    工人阶级和全国人民都知道他是党——他们的劳动和斗争的指导者和他为之服务直到最后一刻的党——的一位杰出的领袖，是共产主义的不倦的战士。
    谨向他的英灵致敬！
