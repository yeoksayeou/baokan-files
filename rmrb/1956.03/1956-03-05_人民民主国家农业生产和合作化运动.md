Agricultural Production and Cooperation Movement in People's Democratic Countries

    **Korea** The ice and snow melting season is approaching, and natural transformation work is being carried out enthusiastically in various rural areas of Korea to increase grain production.

    In about 300 different locations in the main rice-producing areas, projects are underway to expand the irrigated area by 37,000 chongbo (1 chongbo is approximately 15 mu) before rice planting, with more than half already completed.

    The second phase of the largest South Pyongan Province water irrigation project will guarantee the supply of irrigation water before the end of April. If the soil excavated by the natural transformers in Korea in the past 5 months is piled up into a line of one cubic meter, it will be more than twice the entire length of Korea from north to south.

    A large amount of organic and mineral fertilizers produced by the chemical factories in Pukchang, Chongsu, and Sunchon are constantly being distributed to these areas.

    This spring, various saplings will also be planted in areas designated as windbreaks, sandbreaks, and water source forests.

    **Vietnam** The Vietnam National Agricultural Exhibition opened in Hanoi on March 3. The exhibition shows the achievements and splendid prospects of the Vietnamese people in restoring agricultural production.

    The exhibition introduces Vietnam's rich treasures in agriculture, forestry, and fisheries, the state of agricultural production in Vietnam under the colonial and feudal systems, and the achievements of the Vietnamese people in agricultural production after the restoration of peace: 95,000 hectares of wasteland have been reclaimed, and last year's summer and autumn rice crops increased significantly compared to 1954. The exhibition also presents vivid scenes of the Vietnamese people's efforts in land reclamation, drought resistance, and pest control.

    The exhibition showcases various high-yield agricultural products—sweet potatoes and cassava weighing more than ten kilograms each, and very large vegetables, etc. Vietnam's forest products, native products, and tropical crops particularly attract the attention of international friends.

    The exhibition also introduces the new production situation and new life of Vietnamese farmers after organizing mutual aid teams; in various state-owned farms, tractors and various new types of mechanized agricultural implements are being widely used.

    **Poland** From January to February 18 this year, Poland has established 223 new agricultural production cooperatives, which is almost half of the total number of cooperatives established in the entire year of 1955. The speed of cooperative development has recently accelerated. In 18 days of February, 120 were established. The best performing provinces are Bydgoszcz and Poznan, which established 86 and 44 new cooperatives in just over a month, respectively.

    **Romania** Since the beginning of this year, good news of further vigorous development of the agricultural cooperation movement has been pouring in from all over Romania.

    In Bucharest Region, a total of about 2,890 farm households have joined collective farms and united cultivation societies since the beginning of the year, and more than 4,460 individual farmers have established new united cultivation societies.

    Galati Region has also achieved significant achievements in the development of agricultural cooperation. Now the region has a total of 203 collective farms and 388 united cultivation societies. The socialist component of agriculture accounts for about 49% of the total arable land area in the region. In Timisoara Region, about 1,000 individual farmers have joined existing collective farms this year, and hundreds of farmers have expressed their willingness to establish new collective farms.

    **Bulgaria** Bulgaria is currently in a high tide of the great development of agricultural production cooperatives. Sofia newspapers publish news every day about a large number of farmers actively applying and joining agricultural production cooperatives. All states across the country have launched mass movements to participate in cooperatives. In the first two months of this year, more than 33,500 individual farmers submitted applications to join the cooperatives, which is more than the total number of farmers who joined the cooperatives in the entire year of 1955. In Ruse Region alone, 1,700 farmers joined the cooperatives in two days. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    人民民主国家农业生产和合作化运动
    朝鲜  冰雪融化季节快要到来，朝鲜农村各地正在热烈进行改造自然的工作，以便增加谷物的生产。
    在主要产米区的大约300个不同的地方正在进行在插秧前扩大灌溉面积37，000町步（一町步约合15市亩）的工程，其中一半以上已完成。
    最大的平安南道水利灌溉工程第二阶段的工程将保证在4月底以前供应灌溉用水。假使把朝鲜各地的自然改造者们在过去5个月中所挖的土堆成一条一立方公尺的线，它将为朝鲜从北到南全长的两倍以上。
    本宫、青水和顺川的化学工厂所生产的大量有机肥料和矿物肥料正在不断地分配给这些地区。
    今年春天，还要在划出来做防风林、防砂林和水源林的地区栽种各种树苗。
    越南  越南全国农业展览会3月3日在河内开幕。这个展览会显示了越南人民在恢复农业生产方面的成就和瑰丽的远景。
    展览会介绍了越南在农业、林业、渔业方面丰富的宝藏，越南在殖民地、封建制度下的农业生产情形，以及和平恢复后越南人民在农业生产方面所取得的成绩：目前已经有95，000公顷的荒地得到开垦，去年的夏稻、秋稻都比1954年增加很多。展览会还介绍了越南人民在开荒、抗旱、除虫等各方面所作的努力的生动情景。
    展览会里展出了各种丰产的农产品——每个重十多公斤的红薯、木薯，很大的蔬菜等。越南所出产的林产、土产和热带作物特别吸引着国际友人们的注意。
    展览会还介绍了越南农民在组织变工组以后新的生产情形和新的生活；在各个国营农场里，拖拉机和各种新型的机械化农具正被广泛使用。
    波兰  波兰从今年1月起到2月18日，已经成立了223个新的农业生产合作社，差不多相当于1955年全年成立的合作社的一半。合作社发展的速度近来加快了。2月份的18天就成立了120个。成绩最好的是比得哥煦和波兹南省，它们在一个多月中分别成立了86个和44个新的合作社。
    罗马尼亚  今年年初以来，罗马尼亚各地纷纷传来农业合作化运动进一步蓬勃发展的喜讯。
    在布加勒斯特州，从年初到现在共约有2，890个农户加入了集体农庄和联合耕种社，另外还有4，460多户个体农民建立了新的联合耕种社。
    加拉齐州在发展农业合作化方面也取得了重大的成就。现在这个州共有203个集体农庄和388个联合耕种社。农业的社会主义成分约占这个州的全部耕地面积的49％。底密索拉州今年已经约有1，000个单干农户加入了现有的集体农庄，还有几百个农户表示愿意建立新的集体农庄。
    保加利亚  保加利亚目前正处在农业生产合作社大发展的高潮中。索非亚报纸每天都登载大批农民积极申请和加入农业生产合作社的消息。全国所有的州都展开了参加合作社的群众性运动。在今年头两个月中，提出入社申请书的个体农民就超过了33，500户，这比1955年全年入社农民的总数还要多。单是鲁西州，两天中就有1，700户农民加入了合作社。      （据新华社讯）
