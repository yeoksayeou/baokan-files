    Today, Pakistan, based on the draft constitution recently passed by its Constituent Assembly, has declared the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. This is a major event in Pakistan's political life. Our government has dispatched Vice Premier of the State Council, Marshal He Long, as a special envoy to Pakistan to attend the celebrations and to extend congratulations to the Pakistani government and people.
    Pakistan is a new country established more than eight years ago. In the past eight years, the Pakistani people have faced a complex domestic and international situation, and the road they have traveled has not been smooth. Western colonialists have taken advantage of the various difficulties encountered by a new country, attempting to contain the independent development of Pakistan. However, the Pakistani people have made persistent efforts to safeguard their independence and promote the development of their national economy and culture. Facts have proven, and will continue to prove, that in today's Asian and world situation, foreign forces have no way to stifle the national aspirations of Pakistan.
    Pakistan's independence is inseparable from the common struggle of the people of all countries, especially the people of Asia. The characteristic of post-war Asian history is: the unprecedented development of the national liberation movement and the increasing collapse of the colonial system. The Pakistani public deeply understands that strengthening solidarity with the Asian people and safeguarding and consolidating peace in Asia are reliable guarantees for Pakistan to move towards independent development. This desire of the Pakistani public is also reflected in Pakistan's foreign policy. Pakistan, together with India, Burma, Indonesia, and Ceylon, held the Colombo Conference, calling for the restoration of peace in Indochina, thereby playing an active role in reaching the Geneva Accords. Pakistan also initiated and participated in the historic Bandung Conference with the Colombo countries. Now, the "Bandung Spirit" advocating peaceful coexistence and anti-colonialism has become the common thought of millions of people. It is irresistibly promoting the development of the international situation in a direction conducive to peace.
    The Chinese people are happy for the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Our two countries are friendly neighbors. The people of both countries have a common desire: to consolidate peace and oppose war. In recent years, economic and cultural exchanges between China and Pakistan have been increasing, and mutual visits between the people of the two countries have become more frequent. Not long ago, Song Qingling, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of our country, visited Pakistan and was warmly welcomed by the Pakistani government and people. At the same time, the Prime Minister of Pakistan has decided to visit our country this year at the invitation of our government. There is no doubt that the consolidation and development of friendship between China and Pakistan will contribute to the common prosperity of the two countries and peace in Asia.
    At the time of Pakistan's declaration as a republic, the Chinese people sincerely hope and believe that the Pakistani people will achieve important achievements in their efforts to safeguard independence, develop the national economy and culture, enhance the friendship of the people of all countries, and consolidate peace.

### 祝贺巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国成立

    祝贺巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国成立
    今天，巴基斯坦根据它的制宪会议最近通过的宪法草案，宣布成立巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国。这是巴基斯坦政治生活中的重大事件。我国政府已经派遣国务院副总理贺龙元帅为特使，前往巴基斯坦参加庆祝典礼，并向巴基斯坦政府和人民表示祝贺。
    巴基斯坦是在八年多以前成立的新国家。八年多以来，巴基斯坦人民面对着复杂的国内外局势，他们所走过的道路并不是平坦的。西方殖民主义者利用一个新国家所遇到的种种困难，力图遏止巴基斯坦的独立发展。但是，巴基斯坦人民为了维护自己的独立，为了促进民族经济和文化的发展，进行了坚毅的努力。事实已经证明，并且还要继续证明，在今天的亚洲和世界形势之下，外国势力是没有办法窒息巴基斯坦的民族愿望的。
    巴基斯坦的获得独立，是同各国人民特别是亚洲人民的共同斗争分不开的。战后亚洲历史的特点是：民族解放运动空前发展，殖民制度日趋崩溃。巴基斯坦公众深深地懂得：加强同亚洲人民的团结，维护和巩固亚洲的和平，是巴基斯坦走向独立发展的可靠保障。巴基斯坦公众的这种愿望，在巴基斯坦的对外政策上也得到了反映。巴基斯坦曾经同印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚、锡兰一起，举行科仑坡会议，呼吁恢复印度支那和平，从而对达成日内瓦协议起了积极的作用。巴基斯坦又曾经同科仑坡国家一起，发起和参加了具有历史意义的万隆会议。现在，主张和平共处和反殖民主义的“万隆精神”已经成为千百万人民的共同思想。它正在势不可当地推动国际形势朝着有利于和平的方向发展。
    中国人民为巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国的成立而高兴。我们两国是友好的邻邦。两国人民有着共同要求：巩固和平、反对战争。近年来，中国和巴基斯坦之间的经济和文化交流日益增长，两国人民之间的互相访问日益频繁。不久以前，我国全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长宋庆龄访问了巴基斯坦，受到巴基斯坦政府和人民的热情欢迎。同时，巴基斯坦总理已决定于今年应我国政府邀请来我国访问。毫无疑问，中巴两国友谊的巩固和发展将有助于两国的共同繁荣和亚洲的和平。
    在巴基斯坦宣布为共和国的时候，中国人民衷心希望并相信，巴基斯坦人民将在维护独立、发展民族经济和文化、增进各国人民的友谊和巩固和平的努力中，获得重要的成就。
