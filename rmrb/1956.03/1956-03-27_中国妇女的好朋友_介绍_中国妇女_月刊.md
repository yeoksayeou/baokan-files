Chinese Women's Good Friend
    ——Introducing the "Chinese Women" Monthly——
    Lin Guan
    The "Chinese Women" (formerly "New China Women") monthly, founded in July 1949, is a comprehensive political publication centered on women's issues, educating and guiding women's lives with communist ideology and principles. In the past two years, it has become increasingly popular with readers due to significant improvements in its content, highlighting the characteristics of a women's publication. The broad masses of urban street women regard it as teaching material for guiding their work and study, the vast number of women cadres regard it as a good friend for guiding their lives, and many male comrades also enjoy reading articles in "Chinese Women." The circulation of "Chinese Women" continues to increase, and the March issue of "Chinese Women" this year has already reached 840,000 copies.
    The content of "Chinese Women" is multifaceted, so its form is also diverse, including essays, news reports, issue discussions, open forums, novels, poems, short essays, and cartoons. Articles are kept as short as possible, and illustrations are used as much as possible.
    "Chinese Women" has the mission of educating and encouraging women to actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland. Therefore, it extensively reflects the advanced figures and advanced examples in various central tasks of the country, in various positions of the motherland's construction, and among the broad masses of housewives. Through these vivid facts, it educates and encourages women to love the motherland, love socialism, and love labor, actively implement the policies of the Party and the state, and actively participate in the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation. For example, in the agricultural cooperativization movement, it introduced the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives, reflected the high enthusiasm of women in actively participating in the cooperativization movement, and reported on stories of how women learn cooperative charters, actively run cooperatives, and love the cooperatives as their homes. In the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, it published the experiences of ideological remolding of family members of capitalist industrialists and businessmen. In the struggle to eliminate all counter-revolutionaries, it reported on stories of women bravely and cleverly exposing counter-revolutionaries, promoting women's enthusiasm for fighting the enemy, and published stories such as "Project 100," educating women to heighten their political vigilance.
    "Chinese Women" also extensively reports on advanced women from all walks of life who actively participate in the construction of the motherland and social activities. From these reports, it can be seen that sisters on all production fronts, in all positions, and in all families across the country are working heroically and selflessly towards the great goal of building the motherland into a prosperous and happy socialist society. The spirit of many model figures who work and study diligently "everything for the people, everything for socialism" deeply moves and educates readers. These advanced figures become vivid examples for readers to learn from and the most vivid teaching materials to help women's work and life.
    The vast number of women and women cadres in our country are advancing vigorously, but some women still have ideas of belittling labor, seeking enjoyment, and relying on others. "Chinese Women" has strictly criticized these ideas that hinder women's progress. The article "Why Sun Shuduan, Director of the Kunshan County Women's Federation, Has Not Been Working for a Long Time" reported a typical example. Through this example, many women cadres used Sun Shuduan as a mirror to examine themselves, thereby improving their work enthusiasm and sense of responsibility. At the same time, "Chinese Women" also criticized the feudal residual ideas from society that belittle women. The image in the cartoon "Husband's Manner" (July 1955 issue) and the exposure of the idea of not wanting to train female cadres in "This is a Practical Problem" (November 1955 issue) played a positive role in changing the attitude of belittling women in society.
    How to treat love, marriage, and family with communist principles, and how to educate the next generation to become successors to socialist and communist construction is an indispensable part of our entire ideological construction and an important content of "Chinese Women." With the development of national economic construction, new socialist relations are gradually formed and are being formed between people. "Chinese Women" reflects many new types of couples, new types of mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, new types of parents and children, and democratic and harmonious new families. This relationship of equality, mutual assistance, and love between people, and the lovely and happy families, encourage people to work and build a lovely motherland without worry and fearlessly. Therefore, the articles published in "Chinese Women" that express communist morality regarding love, marriage, and family are deeply loved by the vast number of readers.
    However, in our country, some people are also developing bourgeois ideas in marriage and family life, and some still retain feudal ideas, causing much pain to people and families. In this regard, "Chinese Women" often carries out criticisms and discussions of real people and real events (such as "Why Did Our Marriage Break Down?"). Through this mass criticism and discussion, readers recognize the harm to individuals and the revolutionary cause of pursuing a bourgeois lifestyle, corruption, debauchery, and illegal and undisciplined behavior in marriage life, and readers understand how to establish a happy and harmonious family and how to treat and handle their marriage and family problems with a correct attitude. Many readers launched discussions based on the articles published in "Chinese Women," and some even made self-examinations in connection with their own situations. From these reactions and actions, it can be seen that these discussions have a profound impact on readers.
    How to educate children with communist ideological principles is a matter of constant concern for parents. But today, some parents are not good at educating their children and are still accustomed to beating, scolding, coaxing, spoiling, and indulging their children. "Chinese Women" critically reflects these bad educational methods in the publication, while extensively introducing new methods and experiences of parents, teachers, and childcare workers in educating children, and introduces Soviet children's education theory and advanced experience. The currently serialized lectures on educating children according to their age characteristics provide parents with systematic and scientific knowledge of educating children, so that parents and children's workers understand that "there are no bad children, only bad educational methods," and understand that educating children is not a personal matter, but a major event for the country to cultivate builders of socialism and communism. Many parents have improved their thinking and changed their educational methods after reading the articles in "Chinese Women" about educating children.
    With the increasing improvement of people's lives, women urgently need to understand scientific common sense about life. "Chinese Women" publishes common sense about maternal and child hygiene, childcare knowledge, cooking common sense, clothing styles, etc., which not only increases readers' knowledge of life, but also greatly helps protect the health of women and children.
    "Chinese Women" also introduces advanced female figures in the Soviet Union's communist construction as examples for Chinese women to learn from, and promptly reports on major activities of the International Democratic Women's Federation and the struggle of international women for defending peace and fighting for the rights of women and children. Currently, in preparation for the International Women Workers' Conference, "Chinese Women" has continuously reported on the lives and struggles of working women in various countries. These reports enrich readers' international knowledge and increase their internationalist sentiments.

    中国妇女的好朋友
    ——介绍“中国妇女”月刊——
    林观
    “中国妇女”（原名“新中国妇女”）月刊是1949年7月创刊的，是以妇女问题为中心的、以共产主义思想原则教育和指导妇女生活的综合性的政治性刊物。近两年来，由于它在内容方面有了显著的改进，突出了妇女刊物的特色，因此日益受到读者的欢迎和喜爱。广大城市的街道妇女把它当作指导工作和学习的教材，广大妇女干部把它当作指导生活的好朋友，不少的男同志也喜欢阅读“中国妇女”上的文章。“中国妇女”的发行数量不断增加，今年三月号的“中国妇女”，已经发行到八十四万份。
    “中国妇女”的内容是多方面的，因此它在形式上也是多种多样的，有论文、通讯报道、问题讨论、大家谈、小说、诗歌、小品文和漫画等。文章尽量短小，并且尽量多配插图。
    “中国妇女”负有教育和鼓舞妇女积极参加祖国社会主义建设的使命，因此它大量地反映了在国家各项中心工作中，在祖国建设的各个岗位上，以及在广大的家庭妇女中的先进人物和先进事例，通过这些活生生的事实来教育和鼓舞妇女热爱祖国、热爱社会主义、热爱劳动，积极贯彻执行党和国家的政策，积极参加社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业。例如在农业合作化运动中，介绍了农业生产合作社的优越性，反映了妇女群众积极参加合作化运动的高度热情，报道了妇女如何学习社章，积极办社以及爱社如家的故事。在资本主义工商业改造中，刊登了资本主义工商业者家属们思想改造的体会。在肃清一切反革命分子的斗争中，报道了妇女们勇敢机智地检举反革命分子的故事，发扬妇女对敌斗争的热情，并且刊登了“100号计划”等故事，教育妇女提高政治警惕性。
    “中国妇女”还大量地报道了积极参加祖国建设和社会活动的各方面的先进妇女。从这些报道中可以看到，在全国各个生产战线上、在各个工作岗位上、在各个家庭中的姊妹们，都正在为着把祖国建设成为繁荣幸福的社会主义社会的伟大目标，进行着英勇的忘我的劳动。许多模范人物的那种“一切为了人民，一切为了社会主义”而顽强工作和学习的精神，深深感动和教育着读者。这些先进人物成为读者学习的活生生的榜样，成为帮助妇女工作和生活的最生动的教材。
    我国广大妇女和妇女干部都在朝气勃勃地前进，但是，在某些妇女中也还存在着轻视劳动、贪图享受和依赖思想。“中国妇女”对这些阻碍妇女前进的思想进行了严格的批判。“昆山县妇联主任孙淑端为什么长期不工作”一文，报道了一个典型的例子。通过这个例子，许多妇女干部拿孙淑端这面镜子来检查了自己，进而提高了工作积极性和责任感。同时“中国妇女”也批判了来自社会的轻视妇女的封建残余思想。讽刺画“丈夫气概”（1955年7月号）中的形象，“这是实际问题”中不愿意培养女干部的思想（1955年11月号）的揭露，对在社会上改变轻视妇女的态度起了积极的作用。
    如何以共产主义的原则来对待爱情、婚姻和家庭，如何教养下一代成为社会主义和共产主义建设的接班人，这是我们整个思想建设中不可缺少的一个组成部分，也是“中国妇女”的一个重要的内容。随着国家经济建设的发展，人与人之间逐渐形成了和形成着社会主义的新的关系，“中国妇女”反映了许多新型的夫妇、新型的婆媳、新型的父母与子女的关系和民主和睦的新家庭。这种人与人之间平等、互助、友爱的关系，可爱和幸福的家庭，鼓舞着人们无忧无虑地勇往直前地去劳动，去建设可爱的祖国。所以“中国妇女”刊登的表现共产主义道德的有关爱情、婚姻和家庭的文章，深为广大读者所喜爱。
    但是在我们国家里，也有些人在婚姻，家庭生活中滋长着资产阶级思想，有的还残存着封建思想，给人们和家庭造成了许多痛苦。在这方面，“中国妇女”经常开展真人真事的批判和讨论（例如“我们夫妇关系为什么破裂？”），通过这种群众性的批判和讨论，使读者认识在婚姻生活中追求资产阶级生活方式、腐化放荡、违法乱纪的行为，对个人和对革命事业的危害性，使读者了解如何才能建立幸福和睦的家庭，如何用正确的态度来对待和处理自己的婚姻家庭问题。许多读者根据“中国妇女”发表的文章展开讨论，有的更联系自己作了检查。从这些反应和行动中，可以看到这些讨论在读者中所起的影响是相当深刻的。
    如何以共产主义的思想原则教养孩子，是做父母的所经常关心的事情。但是在今天，有些父母还不善于教养子女，还习惯于打骂、哄骗、溺爱和放纵孩子。“中国妇女”把这些不好的教养方法批判地反映到刊物上，同时大量地介绍了父母、教师和保育工作者教养孩子的新方法和新经验，介绍了苏联儿童教育理论和先进经验。现在连续刊登的根据儿童年龄特点进行教育的讲座，给父母以有系统的科学的教育孩子的知识，这样，就使父母和儿童工作者懂得“没有不好的孩子，只有不好的教育方法”，懂得教养孩子不是个人的私事，而是给国家教养社会主义、共产主义建设者的大事。许多父母读了“中国妇女”教育孩子的文章，提高了自己的思想，改变了教育方法。
    随着人民生活的日益提高，妇女们迫切需要懂得生活方面的科学常识。“中国妇女”刊载了妇幼卫生常识、育儿知识、烹调常识、服装样式等，这不仅增加了读者许多生活知识，而且对保护妇女和儿童的健康有很大帮助。
    “中国妇女”还介绍苏联在共产主义建设中的先进妇女人物，作为中国妇女学习的榜样，并且及时地报道了国际民主妇联的重大活动，国际妇女为保卫和平、为争取妇女儿童权利的斗争。目前为迎接国际女工会议的召开，“中国妇女”连续报道了各国劳动妇女的生活和斗争。这些报道，丰富了读者的国际知识和增加了国际主义的感情。
