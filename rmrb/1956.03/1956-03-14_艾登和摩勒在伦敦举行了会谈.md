Xinhua News Agency, March 13th, London News: The talks between British Prime Minister Eden and French Premier Mollet concluded on the 12th. Mollet was invited by Eden to visit London on the 11th after French Foreign Minister Pineau delivered a speech sharply criticizing Western countries' policies.

The joint communique issued after the talks stated that the heads of government of Britain and France exchanged views on major international issues, particularly studying the relations between Western countries and the "Soviet bloc," disarmament, and some issues in Africa and the Middle East. The communique reiterated loyalty to the Atlantic Alliance while expressing the hope for "progress in universal and supervised disarmament." The communique also stated that action should be taken in accordance with the US, British, and French declaration that embodies interference in the internal affairs of Arab countries. The communique also considered that "economic actions in the Far East, the Middle East, and Africa must be valued."

Finally, Mollet and Eden agreed to conduct close and frequent consultations in order to promote their "common policies."

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 12th, TASS: Mollet returned to Paris from London on the 12th after talks with British Prime Minister Eden. On the same day, he gave a speech to the Anglo-American Press Association, discussing the results of the talks. Mollet emphasized that he and Eden had reached complete agreement on the need to "pay more attention to disarmament work." Mollet said that the plan formulated by the French representative to the United Nations Disarmament Committee Subcommittee, Moch, was discussed during the talks. Mollet said that this plan took into account all previous disarmament proposals made by Western countries and the Soviet Union. He said that the talks also discussed suggestions made by Britain that could "supplement and improve the French plan." Mollet said that an "Anglo-French disarmament plan" would be submitted in the next few days for discussion by the upcoming United Nations Disarmament Committee Subcommittee meeting. He expressed the hope that the US government would support this plan.

Mollet then spoke about the economic activities that Western countries will carry out around the world. He believes that these activities will counter the Soviet Union's economic cooperation with many economically backward countries.

Mollet also spoke about the part of the communique regarding "close and frequent" consultations between France and Britain, and explained that the United States and other "relevant countries" will participate in these consultations whenever necessary.

Finally, Mollet said that he had reminded Eden of France's reservations about the Baghdad Pact. He said: "We believe it is necessary to emphasize that in this region of the world, just as everywhere else, that is to say, whether in North Africa, the Middle East, or the Far East, the attention of free countries (referring to Western countries) to economic activities must completely exceed attention to other activities." Journalists believe that Mollet's remarks are an acknowledgment that the divisions between Britain and France caused by the Baghdad military treaty still exist.

    艾登和摩勒在伦敦举行了会谈
    新华社13日讯　伦敦消息：英国首相艾登和法国总理摩勒之间的会谈已经在12日结束。摩勒是在法国外交部长比诺发表演说尖锐地批评了西方国家的政策之后，接到艾登的邀请在11日到伦敦访问的。
    会谈结束后发表的联合公报说，英法两国政府首脑就重大的国际问题交换了意见，特别是研究了西方国家同“苏联集团”的关系、裁军、非洲和中东的一些问题。公报重申忠于大西洋联盟，同时表示希望“在普遍的、有监督的裁军方面取得进展”。公报还表示要根据那个体现对阿拉伯国家内政的干涉的美、英、法三国宣言行动。公报还认为“必须重视在远东、中东和非洲的经济行动”。
    最后，摩勒和艾登同意进行密切的和经常的协商，以便促进他们的“共同政策”。
    新华社据塔斯社巴黎12日讯　摩勒在同英国首相艾登会谈以后，在12日从伦敦回到巴黎。当天他在英美记者协会发表演说，谈到这次会谈的结果。摩勒着重指出，他同艾登就必须“更加重视裁军工作”一事完全达成协议。摩勒说：在会谈过程中讨论了法国驻联合国裁军委员会小组委员会代表莫克制定的计划。摩勒说，这一计划考虑了西方国家和苏联在这以前提出的所有裁军建议。他说，会谈还讨论了英国提出的可以“补充和改善法国计划”的建议。摩勒说，这几天就要提出一个“英法裁军计划”，供快要开会的联合国裁军委员会小组委员会讨论。他表示希望，美国政府会支持这个计划。
    摩勒接着谈到西方国家将在全世界进行的经济活动。他认为，这些活动将对抗苏联同许多经济落后的国家的经济合作。
    摩勒还谈到会谈公报中关于法国和英国进行“密切的和经常的”协商这一部分，并且解释说，在任何必要的时候，美国和其他“有关国家”都将参加这些协商。
    摩勒最后说，他曾经提醒艾登注意法国对巴格达条约的保留条件。他说：“我们认为有必要着重指出，在世界的这一地区，正像在其他各处一样，就是说无论在北非、中东或者在远东，自由国家（指西方国家）对经济活动的注意完全必须超过对其他活动的注意。”新闻界人士认为，摩勒的这些话是承认因巴格达军事条约而引起的英、法之间的分歧仍然存在。
