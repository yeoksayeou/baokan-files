Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 15th: Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama answered questions from a Socialist Party member of the House of Councillors on the Cabinet Committee of the House of Councillors on March 15th.

    Socialist Party member Gengo Kinoshita asked Hatoyama to explain the true meaning of his statement on March 10th that he would be willing to hold talks with Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai if circumstances permitted.

    Hatoyama replied, "For the sake of peace in East Asia, I am willing to negotiate even with Communist China. However, the problem is the relationship with the National Government (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan, hereinafter the same)." Hatoyama also stated that, in his view, "if Communist China does not fight the National Government," it will "stabilize East Asia." He said, "For this purpose, I would like to try to meet with Premier Zhou Enlai."

    Kinoshita further questioned Hatoyama as to whether he intended to request U.S. Secretary of State Dulles to properly handle Sino-Japanese relations. Dulles is scheduled to visit Japan on March 18th.

    Hatoyama replied, "I am willing to frankly tell Dulles my opinions."

    During the questioning that day, public concern was reflected about the U.S. using treaty relations to drag Japan into a war of aggression. Socialist Party member of the House of Councillors, Kanemitsu Tabata, raised the following question to Hatoyama: Although Japan does not have the right of belligerency, the United States does. If Japan and the United States engage in joint operations, what should Japan's Self-Defense Forces do?

    Hatoyama replied that Japan cannot use military force except to exercise the right of self-defense. The Director-General of the Cabinet Legislation Bureau further explained on the spot that Article 24 of the Japan-U.S. Administrative Agreement concerns provisions for when hostile acts have actually occurred or are about to occur in the Japanese region. Therefore, disputes in the Taiwan region are not included.

    鸠山答复关于中日关系等问题的质询
    新华社15日讯　东京消息：日本首相鸠山一郎15日在参议院内阁委员会上答复社会党参议员的质询。
    社会党议员木下源吾要求鸠山说明他3月10日所说如果情况许可他愿意同中国总理周恩来举行会谈这番话的真意。
    鸠山回答说，“为了东亚的和平，就是和共产党中国进行协商，我也在所不辞。不过，问题是同国民政府（按指台湾蒋介石集团，下同）之间的关系。”鸠山还表示，据他看来，“如果共产党中国不和国民政府作战”，将使“东亚安定”。他说，“为了这个目的，我想试着同周恩来总理见见面。”
    木下源吾进一步质问鸠山是否打算就中日关系要求美国国务卿杜勒斯作妥善的处理。杜勒斯即将在3月18日到日本访问。
    鸠山答复说，“我愿意率直地把自己的意见告诉杜勒斯”。
    在当天的质询中，反映出日本公众担心美国将利用条约关系把日本拖入侵略战争。社会党参议员田畑金光向鸠山提出了这样的问题：尽管日本没有交战权，但是美国有交战权。如果实行日美两国联合作战的时候，日本的自卫队该怎么办？
    鸠山回答说，日本除行使自卫权以外，不能使用兵力。法制局长官当场进一步说明，日美行政协定第24条是关于在日本地区实际上已经发生或者将要发生敌对行为时的规定。因此，台湾地区等的纷争不包括在内。
