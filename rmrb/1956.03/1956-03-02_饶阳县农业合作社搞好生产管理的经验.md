Raoyang County Agricultural Cooperatives' Experiences in Good Production Management
Secretary of the Raoyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Chai Rui

Raoyang County is an old revolutionary base area. As early as 1943, the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wu Gong Township appeared. In 1954, agricultural production cooperatives further developed. By 1955, the county had developed to 255 cooperatives, with farmer households joining accounting for more than 74% of the total households in the county. Moreover, more than 90% of the cooperatives increased production by 10% to 30%. Since the publication of Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's resolution on agricultural cooperation, people's spirits have been further boosted, forming a huge driving force to promote the high tide of cooperation. At this time, a new high tide of cooperation emerged throughout the county. Many farmers who originally planned to wait and see for another year or two also joined the agricultural production cooperatives one after another. The number of farmer households joining the cooperatives quickly reached more than 99% of the total households in the county. The scale of the cooperatives also expanded on the original basis, merging into 128 cooperatives (including 24 township cooperatives, 2 linked village cooperatives, and 102 one-village-one-cooperative). These cooperatives were all transformed into advanced cooperatives in January this year, realizing full socialist cooperation. Based on this new change, the county party committee closely carried out the consolidation work of the advanced cooperatives.

	Dividing Cultivation Areas, Matching Draft Animals and Farm Tools

While transforming into advanced cooperatives, most agricultural production cooperatives absorbed new members or carried out mergers of cooperatives, and they were all larger than before. Therefore, after the transformation into advanced cooperatives, the use and management of production materials must first be properly arranged, otherwise, it will cause confusion. For example, the Songqiao Township Cooperative did not divide its cultivation area well, and the members were not active in delivering manure to the outside. In order to prevent confusion in production and lay a good foundation for a large increase in production for the advanced cooperatives, the county party committee led the agricultural production cooperatives throughout the county to quickly carry out the following aspects of work: (1) Land, based on the principle of being conducive to production and easy to cultivate, according to the amount of labor in the production team, the quality and distance of the land, appropriately matched to the team. Before arranging land and dividing areas, each cooperative first carried out land registration, clarified the number of mu of various types of land in that area, and most cooperatives also drew maps. Then, they drafted a plan for dividing areas and matching to the team, which was discussed and revised by the production team and all members, and finally matched to the team. Generally, on-site measurement was carried out to indicate the land boundaries to the production team. The benefit of doing this is: it can prevent errors in the quantity of land and omissions in cultivation. There are two forms of land division in each cooperative: one is that the quality of land in the entire cooperative is almost the same, and the cooperative plants one kind of crop, and the cultivation area is divided according to the direction, and the land is allocated to the team that is close to it. This is convenient for cultivation and saves labor; the second is that, in general, the cooperative divides a large area according to the quality of the land suitable for planting one kind of crop, and then divides it into several small pieces for several production teams to cultivate. A production team is divided into several pieces of land in several large areas. If small pieces can be exchanged, the cooperatives exchange with each other. If they cannot be exchanged, the team that plants it beneficially is allocated to that team. The result of doing this is that it is convenient for mechanized farming and crop rotation, and it is convenient for planting large areas of crops; at the same time, each team also has land for planting various crops, avoiding the phenomenon of uneven busyness and idleness of the members, and it is also convenient for teams to carry out comparisons and competitions. (2) Livestock, in general, the cooperative is based on the number of mu of land in each team, and appropriate matches are made according to the strength and weakness of the livestock, and mules, horses, and cattle. The method of matching is generally not to move, and the method of individual adjustment is adopted. Another method is that each team matches the number of livestock of equal strength and price to the team according to the number of mu of land, and implements a contract system. The method of contracting is, on the one hand, the production team is responsible for the death and loss of livestock, and on the other hand, the cooperative and the team are responsible at the same time. (3) Farm tools, in general, large farm tools are adjusted externally according to the original amount of each team, and the insufficient ones are allocated by the cooperative; small farm tools are brought and repaired by the members themselves. According to the above principles and methods, after repeated discussions and consultations among the members, most cooperatives have now made proper arrangements, which has laid a good material foundation for consolidating the advanced cooperatives and achieving increased production.

	Do a Good Job in Production Planning and Give Play to the Production Enthusiasm of Members

The transition from elementary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives has brought about a major change in production relations and thoroughly liberated productive forces. Therefore, the members have shown unprecedented enthusiasm for labor. However, at the beginning, some cooperative cadres did not see this, and some, although they had already seen it, did not make good use of it and give it play. For example, in Yangchi Township Cooperative, the members were all rushing to participate in farm work, but the cooperative cadres did not arrange farm work for the members in the spirit of increasing production in large quantities, further intensive cultivation, and increasing accumulated fertilizer, but adopted the method of rotating shifts. In Sixing Village Township Cooperative, dozens of members blocked the door of the cooperative director every morning to ask for work, and the cooperative cadres could not find work for the members. This made it difficult to increase yields and achieve the consolidation of advanced cooperatives. In order to adapt to the situation of the members' enthusiasm for labor after advancedization and to achieve increased production in every cooperative, so as to consolidate the advanced cooperatives through increased production, the county party committee first formulated the county's production increase targets and, in particular, the measures to achieve increased production, according to the instructions of the provincial and prefectural party committees, and let the districts, townships, and cooperatives discuss and formulate their own plans. However, at the beginning, not only the members but also the cooperative cadres had conservative ideas and had no confidence in achieving a large increase in production. The county party committee adopted two methods of finding fertilizer sources, calculating detailed accounts, and educating through typical facts to reverse the conservative and backward ideas: 1. Digging up fertilizer sources and calculating detailed accounts so that people can see the potential for increased production and find the direction of struggle. The method of carrying out is to have everyone from cooperative cadres to members start digging up fertilizer sources. The county has found more than 30 kinds of fertilizer sources, and each cooperative has found more than 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, an increase of nine times compared with the past, and some cooperatives have reached more than 20,000 jin. 2. Educate farmers through summarizing typical examples of increased production and using facts. The county party committee highlighted the summary of the experience of Nanguanzhuang dryland cotton yielding 280 jin per mu, Xiliman Friendship Cooperative's yam yield of 8,000 jin, and Gudian's large-scale planting of corn to achieve increased production, and educated everyone to break conservative ideas. Therefore, the county increased the planting of high-yield crops such as yam and corn according to the national planting plan. The county increased the planting of corn from the original 80,077 mu in each cooperative to 212,746 mu, which alone can increase production by 7 million jin to 10 million jin. Through these methods, the thinking of cadres and members was improved. After repeated revisions, each cooperative has formulated production planning targets for increased production. The total guaranteed output of each cooperative in the county is: the average yield per mu of food crops is 343.6 jin of grain, an increase of 2.4 times. Cotton yield per mu is 121 jin, an increase of 1.7 times. Peanut yield per mu is 445 jin, an increase of one time. According to the production plan of each cooperative, each labor day in general cooperatives can be divided into 3 to 5 yuan.

On the basis of doing a good job in production planning, 13 cooperatives in the county proposed to launch a socialist competition, and each cooperative signed the proposal. In general cooperatives, competitions between teams and teams, members and members have also started, further inspiring the enthusiasm of the members for labor. Thus, an unprecedented production upsurge was set off throughout the county. In winter, more than 80% of the labor force was invested in accumulating fertilizer. According to a 10-day statistics, the county accumulated 350 million jin of fertilizer, which is equivalent to the amount of fertilizer accumulated in the county in four months of 1955. Everywhere are crowds of people accumulating fertilizer and delivering manure. Currently, soil moisture conservation work is being carried out, and cooperatives with less animal power are using people to pull the rakes, and people are carrying manure. The cooperatives in the Third District have made preparations for opening canals, and some cooperatives have already started digging wells. Since then, the phenomenon of finding no work in each cooperative in the county has disappeared. Generally, members said: If we do this, we will definitely increase production, and the cooperative will become unbreakable.

	Do a Good Job in Organizing and Using Labor Force

After the county realized full socialist cooperation and launched the agricultural production increase movement, the new problem that appeared was that, on the surface, it was a vigorous and lively scene, but in reality, the labor efficiency of some cooperatives was not high. For example, some cooperatives carried manure in baskets that were not full, which wasted labor, reduced labor efficiency, and affected the rationality of more pay for more work according to labor. In order to solve this problem, the county party committee led the cooperatives to carry out labor planning from the following aspects: (1) First of all, do a good job in the labor organization planning of compiling teams and dividing groups, establish a responsibility system, and eliminate the phenomenon of no one being responsible. For this reason, the county party committee summarized the experience of large cooperatives in elementary cooperatives and promoted it to the cooperatives, so in general cooperatives, there was not much problem in dividing teams and compiling groups. The general practice of the cooperatives is that the management committee of the cooperative sets up production teams, and each team has a captain, political, women's, and technical deputy captains. There are two methods for one township as one cooperative: one is to set up large teams by village, and the other is to form a group led by the members of the village management committee. The process of compiling teams is that the management committee makes a plan for dividing the teams on the basis of doing a good job in the labor organization of the entire cooperative, and then submits it to the members for discussion and approval. It is successful to do this in a planned and led manner. Those that were originally large cooperatives only made individual adjustments, avoiding the phenomenon of affecting production due to major changes. In the labor planning in the division of teams, in general, first of all, the party and youth league members, the backbone force, the strong and weak labor force, the high and low technology, the widowed, orphaned, elderly and weak households, and the landlords and rich peasants who have joined the cooperative should be statistically analyzed, and then, with reference to the members' residence, personnel relations, these households should be appropriately matched. The result of doing this is: to ensure that each team has a certain number of party and youth league members and poor peasant backbone, so that each team has members with strong and weak labor force and high and low technology, which is convenient for allocating farm work and guiding technology. The appropriate distribution of orphaned and elderly households makes it convenient to arrange farm work for them and take care of them, avoiding the phenomenon that some teams have too many orphaned and elderly households, resulting in no one to do work or only a few people can do heavy work. The appropriate distribution of landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries under supervision prevents them from carrying out sabotage and facilitates the members to supervise and transform them. In addition, some cooperatives have also set up youth commando teams. In the division of groups, Wu Gong Cooperative adopted the method of compiling groups according to the nature of agricultural activities, that is, on the basis of doing a good job in labor self-reporting, such as single-compiled livestock groups (and numbered livestock and farm tools), fertilizer accumulation groups, and main management yam groups. After the groups are compiled, different technical training is carried out according to different natures. The benefit of this is that the responsibility is clear, the fixed operation is continuous, which is convenient for giving play to the members' expertise, giving play to creation, and improving labor efficiency. (2) In order to adapt to the new situation of more pay for more work in advanced cooperatives and to make labor remuneration more reasonable, the county party committee focused on Wu Gong Township Agricultural Production Cooperative to come up with a model for labor quota and farm work grading, and then convened a meeting of cooperative directors and labor quota committee directors in the county to introduce and promote it. Therefore, labor grading and quota setting have been carried out universally throughout the county. The general process of the cooperatives is: first, all agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and industrial work are registered one by one, and divided into land preparation, sowing, seedling fixing and pruning, intertillage and harvesting, pulling carts, threshing, fertilizer accumulation and application, sideline occupations, etc. Then, the labor quota committee or cooperative committee, absorbing the production team leader to participate, formulate labor quotas for various farm work according to the quantity and quality that an average normal labor force can complete in one day, that is, "one-day work quota," and divide different farm work into several grades according to the lightness, heaviness, simplicity, complexity, dirtiness, and cleanliness. After the formulation is completed, cadres with explanation ability explain to the members and organize the members to carefully discuss and revise, and finally finalize the plan. Among them, there are two methods of setting quotas, one is that the first grade is the lightest work, and the highest is the ninth grade, which is technically heavy work. The second is: the highest grade is light work, and the lowest is heavy work. According to the trend of continuous development of agricultural technology, it is better to adopt the first method. In the difference in grading, general cooperatives initially adopted a smaller difference. For example, Wu Gong Township Cooperative takes the formulated fifth-grade work as the standard. If one person completes a quota of fifth-grade farm work, it is one labor day. If one completes a quota of sixth-grade farm work, it is 1.05 labor days. When one completes a quota of fourth-grade farm work, it is 0.95 labor days. Each grade differs by 0.05 labor days. Moreover, in general cooperatives, when formulating labor quotas, they also pay attention to formulating different quotas separately for distant and nearby land, soil conditions, and the quality of livestock and farm tools. For example, plowing 6 mu with a double-wheel double-share plow is one quota, and 4 mu with a seven-inch plow is one work quota. Delivering 11 carts of manure to nearby land, 8 carts to middle land, and 5 carts to distant land is one work quota. After the labor quota and farm work grading are done well, some cooperatives began to implement them accordingly, which at the same time implemented a piecework system. Now, the cooperatives that have not completely done a good job in labor quotas and production planning also pay attention to implementing the method of contracting work and recording work by piece in farm work. The actual implementation results have overcome idleness and waste, improved labor efficiency by one-third, and labor remuneration has become more reasonable. (3) At the same time, some cooperatives have also launched a labor self-reporting system for members and formulated construction plans and contracting production plans for the entire cooperative, which has laid a favorable foundation for consolidating the cooperative and achieving a large increase in production.

    饶阳县农业合作社搞好生产管理的经验
    中共河北省饶阳县委员会书记　柴锐
    饶阳县是老区，早在1943年，即出现五公乡耿长锁农业生产合作社。1954年农业生产合作社有了进一步的发展，1955年全县发展到255个社，入社农户占全县总农户74％强，而且90％以上的社增产一成至三成。自从毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”的报告和中共七届六中全会关于农业合作化问题的决议发表以后，更振奋了人们的心情，形成推动合作化高潮的巨大动力。这时全县出现了合作化新的高涨形势。不少的原来打算再看一、二年的农民，也都纷纷加入农业生产合作社。全县入社农户很快就达到总农户的99％以上。社的规模也在原来的基础上随之扩大，合并为128个社（其中乡社24个，连村社2个，一村一社102个）。这些社都在今年一月份转成了高级社，实现了全社会主义的合作化。县委根据这一新的变化，紧紧地进行了高级社的整顿巩固工作。
        划分耕作区，搭配耕畜农具
    各个农业生产合作社在转向高级社的同时，大都吸收了新社员或进行了社和社的合并，都比原来扩大了。因此，转高级社以后，必须先对生产资料的使用管理进行妥善的安排，否则便会造成混乱。如宋桥乡社耕作区没有划好，社员向外送粪不积极。为了防止在生产方面发生混乱现象，给高级社大量增产打好基础，县委领导全县的农业生产合作社迅速进行了以下几方面的工作：（一）土地，本着有利生产便于耕作的原则，根据生产队劳力多少，土地的好坏、远近，适当搭配到了队。各社在安排土地划区以前，首先进行了土地登记，弄清那个方面各类性质的土地有多少亩，大部社并绘了图，然后起草出划区和搭配到队的方案，经过生产队和全体社员讨论修改，最后搭配到队。一般的都进行了到地丈量，指给生产队地边。这样作的好处是：能够防止地亩数量错误和耕种遗漏的现象发生。各社土地划区有两种形式：一是全社土地性质好坏差不多，种植一种作物的社，采取按方向划分耕作区，土地离那队近即分配给那队。这样便于耕作，节省劳力；第二是，一般社根据土地性质好坏以适合种植一种作物的土地，划好一个大区，再划几小片，分给几个生产队耕种。一个生产队分几个大区内的几片土地，零星地能调换者，社和社进行调换，不能调换者，那队种着有利分配给那队。这样作的结果，便于机耕倒茬，便于种植大片作物；同时各队也都有种植各种作物的土地，避免了社员忙、闲不均的现象，同时还便于队和队开展评比竞赛。（二）牲口，一般社是根据各队的土地亩数，按着牲口强、弱，和骡、马、牛等进行适当的搭配。搭配的办法是一般是不动，个别调整的办法。再一种办法是各队根据土地亩数把强弱相等价款相当的牲口数，搭配到队，实行包干。包干的办法，一种是牲口死亡、赔赚由生产队负责，一种是社、队同时负责。（三）农具，一般大农具根据各队原来多少，多的外调，不足的由社调配；小型农具，由社员自带自修。依据上述原则和办法，经过社员反复讨论、协商，目前一般社都已经安排妥善，这就给巩固高级社实现增产打好了物质基础。
    搞好生产规划，发挥社员的生产积极性
    由低级社转成高级社，在生产关系上起了重大变化，彻底解放了生产力。因此，社员出现了空前未有的劳动积极性。但开始有些社的干部看不到这一点，有的虽然已经看到，但是没有很好利用和发挥。例如扬池乡社，社员们都抢着参加农活，而社干部没有本着大量增产、进一步精耕细作、增积肥料的精神，去给社员安排农活，而采取了轮班干活。思杏村乡社每天早晨几十个社员堵着社长门口要活，社干部给社员找不出活作，这样就难以提高产量，达到高级社的巩固。为了适应高级化后社员出现劳动积极性的情况，达到社社增产，从增产来巩固高级社，县委首先根据省、地委的指示，制定了全县增产指标，特别是实现增产的措施，让各区、乡、社进行讨论并制定自己的计划。但是开始不仅社员而且社干部存有保守思想，对实现大量增产没有信心。县委便采取了找肥源、算细账和通过典型事实教育的两种办法，扭转了保守落后思想：一、挖掘肥源算细账使人们看到增产的潜力，找到奋斗的方向。开展的办法是从社干部到社员人人下手找肥源，全县共找到了30多种肥源，社社都找到亩施万斤以上的肥料，比过去施肥增加九倍，有的社达到2万斤以上。二、通过总结增产典型用事实来教育农民。县委突出总结了南官庄旱地棉花亩产280斤，西里满友好社的山药产量8，000斤和固店大量种玉米实现增产等经验，教育大家打破了保守思想。因此，全县按国家种植计划增种了山药和玉米等高产作物。全县由原来各社种玉米80，077亩的基础上增种到212，746亩，只这一项即能增产700万斤至1，000万斤。通过这些方法，提高了干部和社员思想，经过反复修正，各社都制定出增产的规划指标，总合各社全县保证产量是：粮食作物平均亩产343.6斤粮食，增产二点四倍。棉花亩产121斤，增产一点七倍。花生亩产445斤，增产一倍。按照各社的生产规划，一般社每个劳动日能分3至5元。
    全县在搞好生产规划的基础上，由13个社提出开展社会主义竞赛的倡议，社社都在倡议书上签了名。一般社目前也开展起队和队、社员和社员的竞赛，进一步鼓舞了社员劳动积极性。从而在全县范围内掀起了空前未有的生产高潮，在冬季80％以上的劳动力投入了积肥。根据10天的统计，全县就积肥35，000万斤，相当全县1955年四个月的积肥量，到处是积肥、送粪的人群。当前都在开展耙地保墒工作，畜力少的社就用人拉耙盖，人担送粪。三区各社已经作好开渠准备，部分社已经开始打井。从此全县各社找不到活的现象绝迹了。一般社员说：这么干准能增产，社也成了铁打的。
        搞好劳力的组织和使用
    全县实现全社会主义合作化，和开展农业增产运动之后，出现的新问题是，表面上看是轰轰烈烈，实际上有些社劳动效率不高。如有些社送粪筐装不满就担起来跑，这就浪费了劳力，降低了劳动效能，而且影响到按劳取酬多劳多得的合理性。为了解决这问题，县委从以下几个方面领导各社进行了劳力规划：（一）首先是做好编队划组的劳力组织规划，树立责任制，消灭无人负责的现象。为此，县委总结了初级社中大社这方面的经验，向各社进行了推广，因而一般社划队编组中没发生多大问题。一般社的作法是社务管理委员会下设生产队，队内设队长、政治、妇女、技术付队长各一人。一乡为一社者有两种方法：一是以村为单位设大队，二是由该村管委会委员组成小组进行领导。编队过程是，由管委会在作好全社劳力组织的基础上，作出划队的方案，以后交由社员讨论通过。这样有计划有领导地来作是成功的。原来是大社的，有的仅是作了个别调整，避免了因为大变动影响生产的现象发生。在划队中的劳动规划上，一般是首先把全社党、团员骨干力量，壮弱劳力，技术高低，孤寡老弱户以及入社的地主、富农各多少，做好统计，而后再参照社员的住地、人事关系，把这些户适当的进行搭配。这样作的结果是：使各队都有一定的党、团员贫农骨干，使队队都有壮弱劳力和技术高低的社员，便于分配农活指导技术，孤老户适当的分布，便利给他们安排农活，进行照顾，避免了有的队孤老户过多，造成没人做活或只有少数人能作重活的现象。把地主、富农、以及被管制的反革命分子适当分布开，防止他们进行破坏，便利社员对他们的监督、改造。除此以外，有些社还单设了青年突击队。小组的划分上，五公社采取了按农活性质编组的方法，即在搞好劳动自报的基础上，如单编使牲口小组（并把牲口、农具进行编号）、积肥小组、主要管理山药小组，编好组后，并根据不同性质进行不同的技术训练。这样的好处是责任明确、固定作业连续操作，便于发挥社员的专长，发挥创造，提高劳动效率。（二）为了适应高级社按劳取酬的新情况，使劳动报酬更加合理，在和实现高级社的同时，县委以五公乡农业生产合作社为重点，搞出了劳动定额农活分级的样版，然后召开了全县社长和劳动定额委员会主任的会议作了介绍推广，因此全县普遍进行了劳动分级定额。一般社进行过程是：首先把所有农林、畜、副业、工活，逐项进行登记，并分为整地、播种、定苗整枝、中耕收获、拉车、打场、积肥施肥、副业等项别，然后以劳动定额委员会或社委会，吸收生产队长参加，依照一个中常劳力一天所能完成的数量、质量，分别制定出各种农活的劳动定额，即“一日工作额”，并且把不同农活根据轻重繁简脏净分为若干等级。制定好后，由有讲解能力的干部向社员进行讲解，并且组织社员精细的讨论修改，最后定案。其中分为两种定法，一种是一级为最轻活，最高的九级，是技术重活。第二种是：最高级为轻活，最低为重活。根据农业技术不断发展的趋势，采用第一种方法较好。在分级的差额上，一般社开始采用差额较小。如五公乡社以制定的五级活为标准，如一人完成五级农活的一个定额，为一个劳动日，完成六级农活的一个定额，为1.05个劳动日，完成四级农活的一个定额的时候，则是0.95个劳动日。每级相差0.05个劳动日。而且一般社在制定劳动定额的时候，还注意了分别远近地，土质条件，牲口农具好坏，分别制定不同定额。如使用双轮双铧犁耕6亩为一个定额，七寸步犁，即4亩为一个工作定额。送粪近地11车，中地8车，远地5车为一个工作定额。劳动定额农活分级搞好后，一些社便开始按照执行起来，这就同时实行了计件工作制。现在未完全搞好劳动定额和生产规划的社，农活上也注意了实行包工按件记工的办法，实际执行的结果，克服了窝工浪费，提高三分之一的劳动效率，劳动计酬更加趋于合理。（三）和这同时，一些社还发动社员搞了劳动自报制，定出全社施工计划和包工包产方案，这便给巩固好社实现大量增产奠定了有利基础。
