A batch of factories have completed their first quarter production plans ahead of schedule.

The Anhui Provincial Phosphate Fertilizer Experimental Plant, the Baotou Refractory Material Factory, and the Shanghai Municipal Joint State-Private Zhonghe and Guofeng Paper Mills completed their first quarter state production plans one month to twelve days ahead of schedule, respectively.

Since the beginning of this year, the Anhui Provincial Phosphate Fertilizer Experimental Plant has seen a significant increase in labor productivity. In January, the labor productivity of the factory's employees increased by more than 5% compared to the same period last year. On February 9th, employees also set a new record for the factory's daily output, increasing it by 60% compared to last year's average daily output. The employees of the joint state-private Zhonghe and Guofeng Paper Mills have launched socialist emulation campaigns this year. Workers in the paper-making workshop of the Zhonghe Paper Mill, under the premise of ensuring paper quality, increased the speed of the machines from the original 40 revolutions per minute to 47.7 revolutions per minute, increasing the daily paper output per shift from 2.4 tons to 2.7 tons. Employees of the Guofeng Paper Mill put forward 127 rationalization proposals in the first quarter, 39 of which were adopted, leading to improvements in nine major defects, such as blanket imprints. While completing the first quarter's state production plan one month ahead of schedule, the employees of the Baotou Refractory Material Factory also saved a lot of funds for the state. In February, the actual coal consumption of only ten kilns in the factory was reduced by 1,200 kilograms compared to the original plan.

    一批工厂提前完成第一季度生产计划
    安徽省磷肥试验厂、包头耐火器材厂和上海市公私合营中和、国丰两个造纸厂分别提前一个月到十二天完成了第一季度国家生产计划。
    安徽省磷肥试验厂今年以来劳动生产率有了很大增长，一月份这个厂职工的劳动生产率就比去年同期提高了5％以上。二月九日，职工们还创造了这个厂日产量的新纪录，比去年的平均日产量提高60％。公私合营中和、国丰两个造纸厂的职工今年都开展了社会主义竞赛。中和造纸厂造纸车间职工在保证纸张质量的前提下，把车速从原来的每分钟四十转加快到四十七点七转，每班每天产纸从二点四吨提高到二点七吨。国丰造纸厂的职工在第一季度内提出了127件合理化建议，其中有39件被采纳后，毛毯印子等九个主要毛病都有了改进。包头耐火器材厂职工们在提前一个月完成第一季度的国家生产计划同时，还为国家节省了许多资金。二月份这个厂仅十个窑的实际用煤量，就比原计划减少了一千二百公斤。
