    More Widely Promote the "Trepanning Tool"
    Xu Liangui, Labor Model of Shenyang City, Technician at Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory
    I am a technician from a worker background. Last year, with the help of everyone, I studied advanced Soviet experience and successfully trial-produced a hard alloy "trepanning tool." Using this cutting tool can save a lot of steel. For example, the rock drill cylinder produced in our factory is a steel tube as thick as an ordinary thermos bottle. In the past, the core inside was cut into iron filings with a drill bit, wasting more than three kilograms of steel for each one. With the "trepanning tool," the steel material can be completely hollowed out, and these steel materials can also be used to make other smaller things.
    The new "trepanning tool" was successfully trial-produced in September last year, and the leadership attached great importance to it. Relevant leading departments of the province and city also organized promotion in a timely manner. Brother factories from all over the country also sent people to our factory to visit, and some factories also invited me to introduce the situation and perform demonstrations.
    Now many factories have promoted it very well and have achieved good results. However, the promotion situation in some factories is worse. At the end of February, when I was studying the advanced experience of drilling deep-hole forging dies at the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, I visited the situation of their machining of the 1д65 lathe spindle. The hole to be drilled in this spindle is as thick as a thermos bottle shell, so it is most suitable to use a "trepanning tool," but they are still using a drill bit to drill, and a large amount of steel core is being cut into iron filings for nothing, which is really heartbreaking! This operation also wastes a lot of man-hours. They can only machine one with a drill bit a day. According to our experience, two hours are enough with a "trepanning tool." At that time, I asked the operator why he didn't use a "trepanning tool," and he simply replied that he didn't know. But not long ago, the Liaoning Daily also criticized this factory for not promoting the "trepanning tool," which shows that the criticism was not accepted by their leaders. A few days ago, someone from Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory came to our factory and talked about similar situations in their factory. When our factory was testing the "trepanning tool," the No. 2 Machine Tool Factory was conducting the test at the same time. When we succeeded in the test, the workers of their factory were very happy and were the first to come to our factory to visit. But several months have passed, and they still have not promoted it successfully. The attitude of their factory leaders has been quite indifferent. I hope that the leaders of these factories can change their attitude and actively promote the "trepanning tool," because saving steel is also an important responsibility of the factory leaders.
    Here, I would like to make a suggestion, hoping that the leading authorities will pay attention to promoting the "trepanning tool" in relevant factories across the country, especially large factories. In organizing the promotion, I also hope that regular inspections and supervision can be carried out. If any factory encounters difficulties in the promotion, we will do our best to help.

### 更广泛地推广“套料刀”

    更广泛地推广“套料刀”
    沈阳市劳动模范沈阳风动工具厂技术员  徐连贵
    我是一个工人出身的技术员，去年在大伙的帮助下，学习苏联先进经验，试制成功了一种硬质合金的“套料刀”。使用这种一切削工具，可以大量节约钢材。例如我们工厂生产的凿岩机缸体，是像一般热水瓶那样粗的钢筒，过去用钻头把里边的芯子都切成铁屑，一个就浪费三公斤多钢材。用“套料刀”就可以把钢料完整地掏出来，这些钢料还可以用来做其它较小的东西。
    去年九月新“套料刀”试制成功，领导方面都很重视，省、市有关领导部门还及时组织推广。各地兄弟工厂也纷纷派人到我们厂里参观，有的厂还邀我去介绍情况和作操作表演。
    现在已经有许多工厂推广得很好，也有了很好的效果。但是，有些工厂推广的情况就差一些。二月末，我在沈阳第一机床厂学习钻深孔锻模的先进经验的时候，参观了他们车1д65车床主轴的情况。这种主轴要掏的孔有热水瓶壳子那么粗，按说用“套料刀”是最合适的，可是他们还是用钻头在钻，大量的钢芯被白白地切成了铁末子，真叫人痛心！这样操作，工时也浪费很大。他们用钻头一天只能车一个，根据我们的经验，用“套料刀”两个小时就够了。当时，我问操作的工人为什么不用“套料刀”，他只简单地回答说不知道。但是不久以前，辽宁日报还对这个工厂不推广“套料刀”进行过批评，可见批评并没有为他们的领导人员所接受。前些日子，沈阳第二机床厂有人到我们工厂来，谈到他们工厂也有类似情况。当我们厂在试验“套料刀”的时候，第二机床厂就在同时进行试验。我们一试验成功，他们厂的职工都非常高兴，最先跑到我们厂里来参观。但是几个月过去了，他们还是没有推广成功。他们厂领导方面的态度一直相当冷淡。我希望这些工厂的领导人员能够改变态度，积极来推广“套料刀”，因为节约钢材也是工厂领导人员的重要责任。
    在这里，我提出一个建议，希望领导机关注意在全国有关工厂，特别是大型的工厂推广“套料刀”。在组织推广中，还希望能经常进行检查督促。如果哪个工厂在推广中碰到困难，我们一定将尽力帮助。
