Xinhua News Agency, March 19th - "The United States is continually failing in Asia today." This is the lead sentence from a dispatch sent from Tokyo on March 19th by United Press International Asia General Manager, Hobrecht. He said that this is the "basic situation that Dulles had to face" while hosting the conference of American diplomatic envoys to Asian countries in Tokyo.

Hobrecht said: "When we observe the entire Asian region today, and compare it with ten years ago or the recent past, we can see that the United States' position in Asia is declining."

Hobrecht admitted: Most of Asia today is "new." New countries are being born. Ordinary people are taking charge. He said that Asians strongly demand freedom and independence. "In addition to the right to manage their own affairs, these newly independent Asians also want equality. They demand equality. They want to be recognized as having equal status throughout the world, especially among those colonial countries that previously ruled large parts of Asia. This sentiment is one of the most powerful and important forces in Asia today."

Analyzing the current U.S. position in Asia, Hobrecht said: Asians believe that the U.S. favors colonial countries, the U.S. has caused the Geneva spirit to decline, the U.S. practices racial discrimination, the U.S. possesses atomic weapons, and the "methods" of American military and administrative officials in Asia damage the self-esteem of local officials. Furthermore, Asians believe that "the U.S. is a militaristic country and threatens peace"; "the U.S. needs military bases in Asia not to protect the countries where these bases are located, but to attack America's enemies"; also, the U.S. has troops stationed in Asian countries, and these troops have "unfortunate behaviors," causing resentment among the local people.

Hobrecht said, "Many Asians believe that the fact that the United Nations, under the leadership of the United States, failed to achieve victory in Korea has made Communist China a first-rate power in the minds of the Asian masses."

Hobrecht further wrote that people view the "gifts" given by the United States to Asian countries with great suspicion, "Asians do not know what reward the United States is trying to obtain." Some Asians believe that the United States hopes for war in Asia because the United States supports the Chiang Kai-shek clique and Syngman Rhee. Economically, industrialized Asian countries are annoyed by American competition, and agricultural countries are dissatisfied with the dumping of American grain.

### 合众社记者承认  美国在亚洲不断失败

    合众社记者承认
    美国在亚洲不断失败
    新华社19日讯　“美国今天在亚洲正在不断失败”。这是美国合众社亚洲总分社 社长霍布雷奇特三月十九日从东京发出的一条电讯中的导语。他说，这是杜勒斯在东京主持美国驻亚洲国家外交使节会议时“不得不面对的基本形势”。
    霍布雷奇特说：“当我们今天观察整个亚洲地区，并且把它同十年以前或最近的过去相比的时候，可以看出美国在亚洲的地位是在走下坡路。”
    霍布雷奇特承认：亚洲的大部分今天是“新的了”。新的国家正在诞生。普通人当家作主起来了。他说，亚洲人强烈地要求自由和独立。“除了管理他们自己事务的权利以外，这些新近独立的亚洲人还要平等。他们要求得到平等。他们要在全世界范围内，特别是在那些以前统治着亚洲大块地区的殖民国家的中间被认为是具有平等地位的人。这种情绪是亚洲今天最强有力的和最重要的势力之一。”
    霍布雷奇特分析美国目前在亚洲的地位说：亚洲人认为美国偏袒殖民国家，美国使日内瓦精神衰退，美国实行种族歧视，美国拥有原子武器，美国在亚洲的军事和行政官员的“办事方法”损害了当地官员的自尊心。还有，亚洲人认为，“美国是军国主义国家，并且威胁着和平”；“美国需要亚洲的军事基地，并不是为了保护这些基地所在的国家，而是为了进攻美国的敌人”；还有，美国在亚洲国家驻有军队，并且这些军队有着“不幸的行为”，引起了当地人民的恶感。
    霍布雷奇特说，“很多亚洲人认为，联合国在美国领导下没有能在朝鲜取得胜利这件事使得共产党中国在亚洲群众的心目中成为一个第一等的大国。”
    霍布雷奇特又写道，人们怀着非常怀疑的态度看待美国给予亚洲国家的“礼物”，“亚洲人不知道美国企图获得什么报答”。有些亚洲人认为美国希望在亚洲发生战争，因为美国支持蒋介石集团和李承晚。在经济方面，亚洲的工业国家对美国的竞争感到恼怒，农业国家对美国谷物的倾销感到不满。
