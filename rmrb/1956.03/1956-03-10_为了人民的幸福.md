Soviet Academy of Sciences Corresponding Academician Pu Keqi Na

    Editor's Note: Pu Keqi Na is a Soviet fluid dynamicist, Corresponding Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and a Stalin Prize winner. She has solved many important problems related to the movement of groundwater and oil in porous media. In 1952, she first summarized the achievements of Soviet science in filtration theory. Keqi Na is the editor of the first complete collection of works by the Russian mathematician Kovalevskaya, and she has done a lot of research on Kovalevskaya's creations and life. She has been awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labor and medals. This article was recently written by her specifically for this newspaper.

    On the vast land of the Soviet Union, many dams and the largest hydroelectric power stations are being built. In arid areas, irrigation areas are being excavated for irrigating the land. Every such construction project is a great victory for the working people, and the day each project is completed becomes a people's festival.

    The completion of the Samgori Irrigation Canal near Tbilisi gave me an unforgettable and profound impression. Many people stood on both sides of the canal, on the high ground where it could be seen, anxiously waiting for the appearance of water. Suddenly, someone excitedly shouted "Hurrah!" Others followed suit and cheered. The cheers reverberated through the crowd. The water flowed out of the canal and slowly flowed along the depression into a huge pit, forming a lake (now it is completely filled with water), which will be used to irrigate the nearby land.

    This water conservancy project completely changed nature. The bare or sparsely covered brown vegetation has now been covered with a layer of green, just as the saying goes, "the oasis is attacking the desert."

    It is not just the surface of the land that has changed here, but the underground world has also become different. Usually, the topsoil of the land is dry. As the depth of the stratum increases, it becomes more and more humid. At a certain depth—sometimes twenty or thirty meters, sometimes only one or two meters—it is filled with water. River water, lake water, and irrigation water gradually seep downward, while groundwater rises, eventually emerging on the surface and forming swamps. In hot seasons, in dry places, groundwater begins to evaporate when it is about to rise to the surface, while salt evaporates from the ground. Plants wither and die due to excessive salt, and salt can sometimes accumulate into a thick layer.

    What measures should be taken to prevent the land from becoming swampy and alkaline? After making a precise study of a certain area, it is necessary to dig more canals—drainage ditches—to collect excess water and guide them into rivers or the sea. It is necessary to formulate a reasonable irrigation system to remove excess water during irrigation, and sometimes it is necessary to draw water from wells.

    Scientists, including mathematicians, can bring benefits to the study of these problems. They are solving this main task: how to calculate the groundwater situation after the construction of water conservancy buildings (weirs, canals, etc.), when irrigation begins, and when evaporation occurs from the soil surface. In order to prevent the harmful consequences that may arise during the construction of weirs, irrigation, and river flooding, it is very important to predict the future water situation in order to make nature subject to human will.

    My students and I are also studying to solve this type of problem. I have loved mathematics since childhood; I am very happy that I can now apply it to solve interesting and practical tasks.

    When I recall my life, I feel how grateful I should be to the Soviet regime.

    After graduating from secondary school in 1916, I entered the Higher Women's College. Once, I went with a female classmate to listen to a lecture by a very famous professor. At that time, the professor noticed us and said that without the permission of the principal, he would never allow female students to enter his classroom. In the era of Tsarist Russia, female students were discriminated against in their pursuit of education.

    After the October Revolution, the Soviet regime gave women and men completely equal rights. I was able to listen to lectures by any professor.

    Soon, my father passed away, and I had to support my mother and a younger brother. This affected my studies. Everyone tried various ways to help me. I began to receive a scholarship, but it was only enough for me to use alone, and there was still no way to maintain family life. Therefore, I went to a scientific institution as a calculator, where I could get preferential rights to attend lectures. Now, night schools and correspondence courses have been established for college students who are working and want to study at the same time. I successfully graduated from university and continued to teach and engage in scientific work in higher education institutions.

    In my scientific work, I often conduct various experiments.

    Some problems are more convenient to study on instruments and models. For example, pour sand into large glass or metal boxes, make grooves similar to channels on the sand, put water along these grooves, and study the flow of water in the sand. There are other methods for studying this kind of water flow. For example, it can be studied with the help of electricity. Such experimental research is also being carried out in the laboratory of a department I lead.

    At the same time, I also try my best to seize the opportunity to study natural phenomena, which is particularly important for me, who studies theory. I traveled to Central Asia with great interest; I also went to the Fergana Canal with some colleagues, where I saw a beautiful oasis. We also went to the Karakum, where salt-containing sand can cover people, just like snow during a blizzard. I saw the lush cotton in areas with reasonable irrigation systems, and the abandoned saline-alkali land that was still waiting to be processed. This made me deeply realize the necessity of the research work we are carrying out in this area.

    I am a representative of the Russian Supreme Soviet, and I used to be a representative of the Moscow Soviet. I also have a task that sometimes takes up a lot of time, which is to study the extensive correspondence between the Russian mathematician Sofia Kovalevskaya and various scientists. Sofia Kovalevskaya was an outstanding Russian mathematician, the first female professor in the world, and later was elected as a corresponding academician of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Sometimes, based on the materials I have researched, I write papers in mathematics journals or write pamphlets explaining the activities of this famous scientist. She could not find a position in Tsarist Russia and had to be forced to live abroad.

    Our life, the life of my female colleagues, and the life of Soviet women are very interesting. Life is full of work that one loves, interesting travels, and interactions with people who contribute their strength to work that benefits the motherland and all mankind. We are able to live like this thanks to the Soviet system, because the Soviet system has given women the same unrestricted work opportunities as men.

为了人民的幸福苏联科学院通讯院士  普·科琪娜
    编者按：普·科琪娜是苏联流体动力学家，苏联科学院通讯院士，斯大林奖金获得者。她解决了许多有关地下水和多孔介质中的石油的运动的重要问题。1952年，她第一次总结了苏联科学在过滤理论方面的成就。科琪娜是第一部俄国数学家科瓦列夫斯卡娅全集的编辑，她对于科瓦列夫斯卡娅的创作和生活作了很多研究工作。她曾获得劳动红旗勋章和奖章。本文是她最近特为本报撰写的一篇文章。
    在苏联辽阔的土地上，正在建筑许多堤坝和最大的水电站。在干旱地区，正在开凿灌溉土地使用的灌溉区。每一项这样的建筑工程，都是劳动人民的巨大胜利，每一项工程落成的日子，都变成人民的节日。
    梯比里斯附近的萨姆高尔灌溉渠的建成，给了我不能磨灭的深刻印象。许多人站在渠的两岸，站在可以看到它的高地上，焦急地等待着水的出现。忽然有一个人激动地喊了一声“乌拉！”其他人也随着欢呼起来。欢呼声在人群里激荡着。水从渠道里流出来，沿着洼地慢慢地注入一个庞大的基坑，形成一个湖（现在它已经完全注满了水），这个湖将用来灌溉附近的土地。
    这项水利工程完全改变了大自然，光秃的或长着稀疏的褐色植物的地方，现在已经披上一层绿色，就像常说的，“绿洲向沙漠进攻”。
    这里改变的不只是土地的表面，地下世界也变成了另一个样子。通常，土地的最表层的土壤是干燥的。随着地层的深度，它变得越来越湿润。到了某一深度——有时是二、三十公尺，有时只有一二公尺——就充满了水。河水、湖水和灌溉的水，逐渐地向下渗透，同时地下水上升，最后露出地面，形成沼地。在炎热时期，在干燥的地方，地下水在快升到地面的时候，就开始蒸发，同时从地下蒸发出盐。植物由于盐分过多而枯槁和死亡，盐分有时候能积成厚厚的一层。
    为了预防土地变成沼地和碱化，应当采取什么办法呢？在对某地作出精密的研究以后，需要多开凿水渠——排水渠来汲收多余的水，并引导它们注入河或海，需要制定合理的灌溉系统来排除灌溉时多余的水，有时候必须从井里汲水。
    科学家，包括数学家在内，对这些问题的研究，是可以带来好处的。他们正在解决这个主要任务：当水利工程建筑物（水堰、运河等）建成以后，当开始灌溉的时候，当从土壤表面发生蒸发现象的时候，怎样计算地下水的情况。为了预防在建造水堰时，灌溉和河流泛滥可能产生的有害后果，为了使大自然受人的意志的支配，预测未来的水的情况是非常重要的。
    我和我的学生也在研究解决这一类问题。我从童年时代就喜欢数学；我非常高兴，现在我能够应用它来解决有趣的和有实际意义的任务。
    当我回想起自己的生活的时候，我感到应当多么感激苏维埃政权。
    1916年我在中学毕业以后进入高等女子专科学校。有一次，我和一位女同学一起去听一位非常有名的教授讲课。当时教授注意到了我们，就说，没有得到校长的许可，他是决不容许女学生到他的教室里去的。在帝俄时代，女学生求学都受到歧视。
    十月革命以后，苏维埃政权赋予妇女和男子完全平等的权利。我能够听到任何一位教授的讲课了。
    不久，我父亲去世了，母亲和一个小弟弟都要由我供养。这就影响到我的学习。大家想各种办法来帮助我。我开始得到奖学金，但是这只够我一个人用，家庭生活还是没有办法。因此我到一个科学机关作计算员，在这里我可以得到听课的优待权利。现在，对于这样正在工作而同时想学习的大学生，是成立了夜校和函授班。我顺利地在大学毕业了，并且继续在高等学校里教书和从事科学工作。
    在科学工作中，我常常进行各种实验。
    有些问题在仪器上和模型上来研究更方便些。如把沙子倒进大的玻璃箱子或金属箱子里，在沙子上做成类似渠道的凹槽，沿着这些凹槽放水，研究水在沙子里的流动情况。研究水的这种流动情况，还有其他的方法，例如可以借助于电来研究。在我所领导的一个部门的实验室里，也进行着这种实验性的研究。
    同时我也竭力利用机会研究自然界的现象，这对于我这个研究理论的人来说，是特别重要的。我曾怀着极大的兴趣旅行了中亚细亚；也同一些同事到过费尔干纳运河，在那里我看到了美丽的绿洲。我们也到过卡拉库姆，在那里带有盐分的沙子能把人盖起来，就好像暴风雪时候的雪一样。我看到了有合理灌溉系统的地区的茂盛的棉花，和还在等待着对它们加工的荒废的盐渍地段。这使我深刻地了解到我们在这方面所进行的研究工作的必要性。
    我是俄罗斯最高苏维埃代表，从前当过莫斯科苏维埃代表。我还有一项有时要占去很多时间的任务，就是研究俄国数学家索菲亚·科瓦列夫斯卡娅和各科学家大量的通信。索菲亚·科瓦列夫斯卡娅是俄国卓越的数学家，世界上第一个女教授，后来被选为彼得堡科学院通讯院士。有时我根据已经研究过的材料，在数学杂志上写些论文，或写一些阐述这位著名的科学家活动的小册子。她在沙皇俄国找不到职位，不得不被迫住在国外。
    我们的生活，我和我的女同事的生活，苏联妇女的生活是非常有趣的。生活里充满了自己热爱的工作，有趣味的旅行，和同那些把自己的力量贡献给有利于祖国和全人类的工作的人们的交往。我们所以能够这样生活，应当感谢苏维埃制度，因为苏维埃制度使妇女有了像男人一样毫无限制的工作机会。
