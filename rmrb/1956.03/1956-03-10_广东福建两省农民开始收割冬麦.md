Farmers in Guangdong and Fujian provinces have begun harvesting winter wheat.

In Guangdong Province, more than 5 million mu of winter wheat is now golden, and some has already been harvested. In the main wheat-producing areas of Beijiang and both banks of the Han River, the wheat is generally full and plump this year. In Lufeng County, where harvesting began earliest, winter wheat has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The No. 1 Agricultural Cooperative of Zhu Lake Township harvested an average of 270 jin per mu last year, and this year it harvested 391 jin per mu, an increase of 44.8%. This year, the province expanded its winter wheat cultivation by a total of 2 million mu. Since planting, farmers have paid special attention to field management, so the wheat is mostly growing better than in previous years. (Our correspondent in Guangzhou)

The rural areas of Fujian after cooperativization have begun harvesting wheat and barley. News of bumper harvests keeps coming. In the Putian Plain, the more than 2,000 mu that have already been harvested have generally increased in yield. In Gangli Township of this county, the more than 4 mu of barley that have been harvested yielded 370 jin per mu, an increase of 70%. During the high tide of cooperativization, Fujian farmers planted more than 3.6 million mu of wheat and barley, an increase of more than 30% compared to last year. (Our correspondent in Fuzhou)

    广东福建两省农民开始收割冬麦
    广东省500多万亩冬小麦，现在已经一片金黄，有的已经收割。主要产麦的北江等地区和韩江两岸的麦子，今年普遍结实饱满。最早开镰收割的陆丰县，冬小麦获得空前的丰收。竹湖乡第一农业合作社去年平均每亩收麦270斤，今年每亩收得391斤，增产44.8％。今年全省冬小麦共扩大了200万亩。自播种以来，农民特别注意田间管理，因此麦子大多比往年生长良好。　（本报驻广州记者）
    合作化后的福建农村开始收割大小麦。丰收喜讯不断传来。莆田平原已收的两千多亩，普遍增产。这个县的港利乡已收的4亩多大麦每亩产370斤，增产七成。福建农民在合作化高潮中种了360多万亩大小麦，比去年扩大30％多。（本报驻福州记者）
