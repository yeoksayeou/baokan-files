    Chinese Academy of Sciences Zoological Research Laboratory Opens Rodent Research Laboratory
    The Zoological Research Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences recently opened a new rodent research laboratory. Zoologists have collected many rodent specimens from various places for research and experimentation.
    Systematic research on rodents is the first of its kind in the history of zoology in China. This research work is led by zoologist Shou Zhenhuang. They first studied the history of rodent damage. There are many records of "rodent damage to crops" in history for more than 1,000 years. For example, during the Yuan Dynasty, more than 100 acres of crops in Qingyang, Yan'an and other places were eaten by field mice in one day. According to surveys, almost every barn in every region has rat holes, and every hole has stored grain. A large rat (brown rat) can eat 9 kilograms of grain per year. A souslik can eat 8 to 16 kilograms of corn or sorghum in farmland during the summer.
    Scientists have conducted experiments and research on the living habits of rodents and initially proposed methods to eliminate rodents. A method of first using non-toxic food to lure rats to eat, and then using poisoned bait, can achieve good results. Cats and dogs can catch rats, and trained hunting dogs can catch more than 100 rats every day. Scientific workers discovered in relevant materials that an owl can eliminate a large number of harmful rodents that can eat one ton of grain in a year.
    Scientific workers also guide or participate in farmers' rat-catching campaigns in agricultural production cooperatives such as Baofusi Township in the suburbs of Beijing; and continue to study the classification, distribution, reproduction and drug tests of rodents. Before opening the rodent research laboratory, scientific workers also conducted some investigations and studies on rodent damage in Inner Mongolia, the Greater Khingan Mountains, and the Changbai Mountains in conjunction with other research work.

    中国科学院动物研究室开辟鼠类研究实验室
    中国科学院动物研究室最近新开辟鼠类研究实验室，动物学家们从各地搜集了许多鼠类标本进行研究实验。
    系统地对鼠类进行研究，这在我国动物学史上还是第一次。这项研究工作是由动物学家寿振黄领导的。他们首先对鼠类为害的历史作了研究。1，000多年来历史上有很多“鼠害稼”的记录。如元朝时庆阳、延安等地曾发生100多亩庄稼为野鼠一天吃尽的事情。据调查，各地几乎仓仓有鼠洞，洞洞有存粮。一只大家鼠（褐鼠）每年可吃9公斤粮食。一只黄鼠夏季就可在农田中吃掉8到16公斤玉米或高粱。
    科学家们进行了鼠类生活习性的实验和研究，初步提出了消灭鼠类的办法。一种先用无毒食物引诱老鼠吃，然后放毒饵的办法，可以获得良好的效果。猫和狗都能捕鼠，有训练的猎犬，每天可以捕鼠100多只。科学工作者在有关资料中发现一只猫头鹰一年中可以消灭能吃掉一吨粮食的大批害鼠。
    科学工作者还在北京市郊区保福寺乡等农业生产合作社指导或参加农民的捕鼠运动；继续研究鼠类的分类、分布、繁殖和药剂试验等问题。在开辟鼠类研究试验室以前，科学工作者结合其他研究工作在内蒙古、大兴安岭、长白山等地对鼠害也作了一些调查研究。　（新华社）
