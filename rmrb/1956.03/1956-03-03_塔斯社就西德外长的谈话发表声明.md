Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 2nd. TASS issued the following statement on March 1st:

TASS statement:

Dr. von Brentano, Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany), has recently made many remarks, in which, when addressing the issue of German reunification and the relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union, he insisted that the reunification of Germany could occur without an agreement between the two Germanies, and that with the exchange of ambassadors between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany, the Soviet government should be expected to begin negotiations on the issue of German reunification.

Soviet authorities issued the following statement regarding Mr. Brentano's remarks:

Mr. Brentano's speech can only spread illusions on the road to German reunification and will never promote the cause of German reunification. The Soviet government has stated very clearly both during the Four-Power Geneva talks and during the negotiations held in Moscow with the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, that since there are two sovereign states in Germany that are both recognized internationally, the only way to achieve reunification is through direct negotiations between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. Considering the actual situation in Germany, it should be understood that there is no other way to resolve this issue. Since the Soviet Union has formally recognized the sovereignty and independence of the German Democratic Republic, it certainly cannot resolve any issues for the German Democratic Republic, nor can it hold negotiations on its behalf. However, the Soviet government advocates the reunification of Germany into a peace-loving and democratic country, and as it has diplomatic relations with both the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, it is willing to play a promoting role in achieving the necessary agreement between them. At the same time, the Soviet government still believes that those who are truly concerned about the restoration of German reunification will not fail to work towards the rapprochement between the two Germanies and the establishment of corresponding cooperation, which is in line with the wishes of the German people themselves, who are waiting for effective measures to be taken in this regard.

As for the issue of relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany, the Soviet government believes that all conditions now exist for the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany to establish good and friendly relations. At the same time, if the Federal Republic is willing and able to develop trade relations with the Soviet Union, the Soviet side welcomes this and believes that there are broad possibilities in this regard.

The Soviet government hopes that, despite the obstacles caused by certain reasons, the relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany, including broad trade and cultural ties, will develop smoothly, because this is in line with the interests of both countries and with the interests of establishing peace in Europe.

    塔斯社就西德外长的谈话发表声明
    新华社2日讯　塔斯社莫斯科1日讯：塔斯社发表声明如下：
    德意志联邦共和国（西德）外交部长勃伦塔诺博士最近发表了很多谈话，其中谈到统一德国和德意志联邦共和国同苏联的关系的问题的时候，他把事情硬说成是，统一德国可以不需要两个德国之间取得协议，并且由于苏联同德意志联邦共和国互换了大使，就应该期待苏联政府方面开始来就统一德国的问题进行谈判。
    苏联权威人士就勃伦塔诺先生的这些谈话发表声明如下：
    勃伦塔诺先生的演说只能在统一德国的道路上散布幻想，而绝不会促进统一德国的事业。苏联政府无论在四国日内瓦谈判的时候和同德意志联邦共和国以及德意志民主共和国在莫斯科举行的谈判中都曾经完全肯定地声明，由于德国存在着两个都得到国际承认的主权国家，达到统一的唯一道路就是德意志民主共和国同德意志联邦共和国进行直接谈判。考虑到德国的实际情况，就应该明白，解决这个问题没有另外的道路。苏联既然已经正式承认德意志民主共和国的主权和独立，当然就不能够替德意志民主共和国解决任何问题，不能够代替它举行谈判。不过苏联政府主张德国重新统一成为一个爱好和平和民主的国家，并且同德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国都有着外交关系，所以愿意在它们之间取得必要的协议方面起促进作用。同时苏联政府仍旧认为，真正关心德国恢复统一的人不会不致力于两个德国之间的接近和建立相应的合作，这是符合等待着在这方面采取有效措施的德国人民本身的愿望的。
    至于谈到苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间的关系的问题，苏联政府认为，现在有一切条件使苏联和德意志联邦共和国建立良好的和友善的关系。同时，如果联邦共和国愿意和能够同苏联发展贸易关系，苏联方面欢迎这样做，并且认为在这方面有着广泛的可能性。
    苏联政府希望，尽管有着由于某些原因造成的障碍，但是苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间的关系，包括广泛的贸易联系和文化联系，将得到顺利的发展，因为这是符合两国的利益和符合建立欧洲和平的利益的。
