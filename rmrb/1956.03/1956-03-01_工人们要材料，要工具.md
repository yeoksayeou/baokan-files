Workers Need Materials, Need Tools
By Our Correspondent Fan Rongkang

On February 16th, Comrade Bai Yukun, the Party Branch Secretary of the Second Workshop of the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory, told me that their processing of the 1K36 lathe parts involved a total of 712 procedures, and now the norms for 682 procedures have been exceeded.

However, he continued: In January, they did not fulfill the plan, falling short by 2,800 work hours. As of yesterday in February, they have already fallen short by more than 4,000 work hours.

What’s going on?

I sat in the workshop office for less than two hours, and all I heard was people rushing back and forth shouting "waiting for materials." Comrade Gu Wenhai, the workshop's planning dispatcher, had just reported that two small planers were waiting for materials when the planning dispatcher of the first work section handed over a list of 48 parts, requesting that materials be allocated within the next day or two, otherwise production would have to stop. The workshop director had intended to hold a meeting in the evening to arrange the work plan, but because there were no materials, the meeting could not be held. The instruction charts had also long lost their effectiveness.

Comrade Gu Wenhai said: "We have been living like this for more than a month now, constantly complaining about waiting for materials, waiting for materials."

Comrade Bai Yukun said: "It's not just waiting for materials, but the batches of materials put into production are also too small. Many parts of the 1K36 lathe that we process in our workshop are clamped and machined together in batches of five. Now, with the small batches, three, two, or even one have to be clamped and machined. This increases auxiliary work hours and greatly reduces efficiency. Zhang Yingdi is a great young man, but today he only did 15 minutes of work for the entire morning."

Comrade Gu Wenhai added: "Another problem is that the materials are too large and do not meet the standards, and the machining allowance is also too large." The bed of the 1K36 lathe is only supposed to be cut by four to five centimeters according to regulations, but because the material is too large, it has to be cut by 20 centimeters. Large materials not only waste valuable metal but also waste processing time. The workers who process the bed said: "If the problem of large materials can be solved, the processing efficiency of the bed can be increased by 60%."

Waiting for jigs, waiting for cutting tools, and waiting for fixtures are as serious a threat to production as waiting for materials. Some jigs cannot be supplied, affecting production for a whole month. Some reamers cannot be supplied, and we can't just sit idle, so we have to "make do" with waste reamers. Once, this resulted in the scrapping of a large headstock component.

In order to solve the problem of waiting for materials, the factory called for "do whatever you can," and the workshop is constantly "adjusting tasks." The "three fixings" of fixing machines, fixing work, and fixing people are not working. In the Zhang Guobin group, which is famous throughout the factory for actively and proactively formulating advanced group plans, 9 out of 13 people have changed jobs. Rationalization proposals are put forward, but the job is changed before they can be used. Many of their plans encounter difficulties and cannot be realized. Xu Shouzhi and Qin Lianyuan, two old workers who operate large Soviet planers, can sometimes do 20 hours of work in 8 hours, but the materials for the planer are not delivered in a timely manner, so the workshop has to transfer these two old workers to an old-fashioned belt-driven lathe to do odd jobs, working hard all day but only able to do 6 hours of work.

"This is the current situation in our workshop." Comrade Bai Yukun said to me: "Listen! The machines in the workshop are all running, and the workers are all busy, as if no one is idle. But how much value can they create?" He took out a list with the names of 19 young workers written on it. In the first half of February, the work they completed was at most one-third of the total work for the month, and some even only completed one-tenth of the total work for the month.

More than a month ago, the workers here had confidently discussed completing the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The workshop used to require 678 processing hours to manufacture various parts for the 1K36 lathe, but this year the workers voluntarily reduced it to 493 hours. The workers said: "If the material supply is timely, the batches are appropriate, the tools are not delayed, and the machines and work are fixed, we can reduce another 21 hours." The workshop leaders happily replied to the workers: "The 1K36 lathe will be produced in large quantities, so the batches will not be small. Please rest assured about the preparatory work; we guarantee that it will be done well." In this way, the time quota for the 1K36 lathe was further reduced to 472 hours.

The quotas were reduced, but all the promises of guarantees were broken. The workers had just broken through the quotas for one procedure after another, but were dragged back by the backwardness of the material and tool supply work. They are falling behind the plan, anxious, and unable to catch up. Some are complaining, some are shouting at the planning dispatcher, and some are questioning the workshop leaders: "Do you keep your word? Why don't you mean what you say?"

The workshop staff are speechless in the face of the workers' questions, and some are even afraid to meet the workers. Duan Wenhui, the section chief of the Second Work Section, was pushed too hard by the workers, cried, and said: "In this situation, the higher the workers' enthusiasm, the less I can do."

Who is stifling the enthusiasm of the workers in the Second Workshop to complete the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule? Is it the workshop staff? No. Although they shout about waiting for materials a lot, and their efforts to maintain stable production order and avoid shutdowns as much as possible are not enough, it is impossible to reverse this chaotic situation by relying solely on the efforts of the workshop itself; the main problem lies in the work of the factory management.

In the fourth quarter of last year, the factory outsourced some of the castings required for the 1k36 lathe to a factory in Wafangdian for cooperation, but failed to urge them closely. At the end of the year, the workshop proposed that the castings should be supplied in a timely manner to ensure the completion of the January production plan. The factory said "guaranteed supply." However, it was not until January 28th that the representatives of the youth supervision post in the workshop went to the factory director and learned that the casting samples from the outsourced factory were unqualified and had not been cast at all. Under the supervision of the youth supervision post, the factory expressed its determination to solve the problem of waiting for materials in the Second Workshop. However, most of the parts that had arrived were not put into production on the specified dates. By February 19th, the waiting for materials was even more serious, and several machine tools had to be stopped.

The most important reason for the problem of waiting for materials in the Second Workshop is that the leadership work of the No. 3 Machine Tool Factory has fallen behind. They did not expect that the enthusiasm of the masses to complete the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule would be so high, and they did not anticipate that this powerful force would break through all the old systems and old work styles that could not adapt to it. Therefore, they were unable to catch up with the masses in time and guide them forward. They initially closed their doors to make plans, and were criticized by the masses again and again for being "conservative" and unable to carry them out. It was not until they had finalized the plan that they were exhausted and had no time to quickly reverse the backward state of production leadership.

However, the factory leadership also has its difficulties. Factory director Liu Xin said: "The factory has not solved the problem of waiting for materials in the Second Workshop very well; however, some problems cannot be solved by the factory itself." This is indeed the case. At a time when everyone is calling for completing the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, the supply sources of materials and tools for the No. 3 Machine Tool Factory (and not just the No. 3 Machine Tool Factory) are indeed much more difficult than before, and the mid-way change in the supply of cooperative castings has made them even more passive.

The workers are full of enthusiasm and strength to complete the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. They need materials and tools. This is an urgent problem that all enterprises and all industrial departments should quickly solve.

    工人们要材料，要工具
    本报记者　范荣康
    2月16日，沈阳第三机床厂第二车间的党支部书记白玉昆同志告诉我，他们加工的1K36车床的各种部件共有712道工序，现在有682道工序的定额都被突破了。
    但是他接着说：1月份他们没有完成计划，拉下了2，800小时的工作量。2月份到昨天为止，又拉下了4，000多小时的工作量。
    这是怎么一回事呢？
    我在车间办公室坐了不足两小时，只听得人们嚷着“待料”两字来回窜。车间计划调度员顾文海同志刚汇报两台小刨床待料了，第一工段计划调度员又递上一纸清单，列了48项部件，要求在最近一两天内下料，否则就要停车。车间主任本想在晚间开个会，排排作业计划，因为没有料，会也开不起来。指示图表也早已失去作用。
    顾文海同志说：“最近一个多月来，我们就是这样生活的，成天吵着待料、待料。”
    白玉昆同志说：“不仅是待料，而且投料的批量也太小。我们车间里加工的1K36车床的许多部件都是五个五个地卡住一齐车的，现在批量小，三个、二个、甚至一个也得卡上去车。这么一来，辅助工时增加了，效率大大降低。张英弟是个挺棒的小伙子，今天整整一个上午只干了一个15分钟的活。
    顾文海同志补充说：“还有一个问题是料大、不合标准，加工的余量也大。”1K36车床的床身，按照规定只需切削四个到五个糎，因为料大，竟要切削20个糎。料大，不仅浪费宝贵的金属，而且浪费加工时间。加工床身的工人说：“如果料大的问题能够解决，床身的加工效率可以提高60％。”
    待治具、待刀具、待卡具也同待料一样严重地威胁着生产。有的治具供应不上，足足影响生产一个月。有的绞刀供应不上，又不能闲着，只得用废绞刀来“凑合”，有一次就因此废了一个床头大部件。
    为了解决待料问题，厂里号召“有啥干啥”，车间里无时无刻不在“调剂任务”。定机、定活、定人的“三定”工作行不通了。在以积极主动制订先进的小组规划闻名全厂的张国斌小组里，13个人中有9个人换了活。合理化建议刚提出来，活就换了，用不上。他们的规划有很多都遇到困难没法实现。操纵大型苏联摚床的徐守智、秦连元两位老工人，有时一个人8小时能干20小时的活，但摚床的料迟迟不下来，车间只得把这两位老工人调到一台老式皮带车床上去做零星活，一天死扣，只能干6小时的活。
    “这就是我们车间的现状。”白玉昆同志对我说：“你听！车间的机器都在响着，工人们都在忙着，好像谁也没有闲下来。可是，他们能创造多少价值呢？”他拿出一张名单，上面写有19个青年工人的名字，他们在2月上半月完成的工作量，最多的也不足全月工作量的三分之一，有的甚至只完成全月工作量的十分之一。
    一个多月以前，这里的工人曾经满怀信心地讨论过提早完成第一个五年计划。这个车间制造1K36车床的各种部件，过去要678个加工工时，今年工人们主动压缩为493个工时。工人们说：“如果材料供应及时，批量合适，工具不耽误，定机定活，还可以再减21个钟点。”车间的领导人员兴高采烈地回答工人们说：“1K36车床要大批生产，批量不会小的。关于准备工作，大家请放心，保证搞好。”这样，1 K36车床的工时定额又压缩为472小时。
    定额压缩了，一切保证的诺言都落空了。工人们刚刚突破了一道一道工序的定额，又被材料和工具供应工作的落后现象拖了回来。他们落在计划的后面，干着急，撵不上去。有的发牢骚，有的冲着计划调度员嚷，有的去责问车间领导人员：“你们讲不讲信用？为啥说话不算数？”
    车间工作人员面对着工人的责问哑口无言，有的甚至不敢同工人见面。第二工段的工段长段文惠同志被工人追急了，哭了一场，说：“现在这个情况，工人情绪越高，我越干不了。”
    是谁窒息着第二车间工人们提早完成第一个五年计划的热情？是车间的工作人员吗？不。虽然他们喊叫待料的时候多，从主观上努力、尽可能地稳定生产秩序、尽可能地避免停车还做得不够，但是仅依靠车间本身的努力，是不可能扭转这种混乱状况的；主要的问题是在厂部的工作上。
    去年第四季度，厂里把1k36车床所需要的一部分铸件外包给瓦房店一家工厂协作，却没有抓紧督促。年底，车间提出铸件要及时供应，才能保证完成1月份的生产计划。厂里说“保证供应”。但是，直到1月28日，车间的青年监督岗派了代表去找厂长，才知道由外厂协作的铸件样品不合格，根本没有浇铸。在青年监督岗的督促下，厂里表示下决心解决第二车间的待料问题。可是，大部分已到部件都没有按规定日期投料。到2月19日，待料更严重，有好几部机床不得不停了车。
    第二车间的待料问题，最主要的原因在于第三机床厂的领导工作落后了一步。他们没有料到群众提早完成第一个五年计划的热情会这么高，没有估计到这支强大的力量会要冲破一切不能和它相适应的旧制度、旧作风的障碍，因而没有能及时赶到群众前面去，引导群众前进。他们始而是关起门来搞规划，一次又一次被群众批评为“保守”，拿不下去。好容易把规划定下来，已经是精疲力尽，无暇迅速来扭转生产领导工作的落后状态。
    不过，厂的领导上也有苦衷。厂长刘新同志说：“第二车间的待料问题，厂里是没有很好地解决；可是，有些问题也是厂里本身不能解决的。”事实也确实如此。在到处呼喊着提早完成第一个五年计划的时候，第三机床厂（其实又何只是第三机床厂）材料和工具的供应来源确实比以前难多了，协作铸件的供应中途变卦，更使他们被动。
    工人们充满了提早完成第一个五年计划的热情和力量，他们要材料，要工具，这是各个企业，也是各个工业部门应该迅速解决的一个迫切问题。
