Learning from Production Troops

The People's Committee of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region recently organized 1,700 farmers from various ethnic groups, including Uyghur, Xibe, Hui, and Han, to study advanced farming techniques for cotton, wheat, corn, rice, and oil crops at farms belonging to the Production and Construction Corps in the Manas River basin and Aksu.

This study will begin with spring plowing and end with the summer harvest, lasting a total of five months. The learning method is learning by doing, and learning while summarizing. After completing their internship, these farmers will reach the level of junior technicians, enabling every township in Xinjiang's agricultural areas to have junior technical personnel.

To ensure effective learning, each county has been equipped with translators. The farm's companies have also studied ethnic policies and made appropriate arrangements for the lives of farmers who adhere to Islam.

The crops of the farms belonging to the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps have achieved very high yields, setting a demonstration role north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. Concentrated organization of farmers of all ethnic groups to learn the advanced farming techniques of the Corps' farms can not only help farmers of all ethnic groups quickly improve their farming techniques, but also further strengthen the ties between the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang and the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang.

    向生产部队学习
    新疆维吾尔自治区人民委员会最近组织维吾尔、锡伯、回、汉等各族农民一千七百人，到玛纳斯河流域和阿克苏生产建设部队所属的农场，学习棉花、小麦、玉米、水稻和油料作物的先进耕作技术。
    这次学习将从春耕开始到夏收结束，学习的时间共五个月。学习的办法是边学边做，边学边总结。这批农民实习期满后，都可以达到初级技术人员的水平，从而使新疆农业区乡乡都能有初级技术人员。
    为了保证学习好，各县都配备了翻译员。农场的各连队也学习了民族政策，并且对信仰伊斯兰教的农民的生活也作了适当的安排。
    新疆生产建设部队所属农场的作物，获得了很高的产量，在天山南北起了示范作用。集中地组织各族农民学习部队农场的先进耕作技术，不但可以帮助各族农民迅速提高耕作技术，而且会进一步加强驻新疆的人民解放军和新疆各族人民的联系。
