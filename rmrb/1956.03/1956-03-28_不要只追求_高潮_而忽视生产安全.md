　　The East Da Well Engineering Section of the Basic Construction Bureau of the Fengfeng Coal Mine in Hebei Province had seven accidents between March 8th and 12th, injuring thirteen people. According to statistics from three major accidents, production was stopped for a total of seventy-one hours.

　　In the past, the East Da Well Engineering Section was a backward unit that consistently failed to meet its targets. To change this situation, the leaders of the Engineering Section had wanted to use large-diameter blasting to improve efficiency, but they couldn't because they couldn't buy large-diameter blasting explosives. On February 1st, the Basic Construction Bureau of the Fengfeng Coal Mine held an experience exchange meeting, and the Deputy Director criticized the East Da Well for its long-term failure to complete its plans, and demanded that East Da Well find its own way to find explosives and test the promotion of large-diameter blasting experience. After the meeting, the East Da Well Engineering Section used small-diameter blasting explosives to replace large-diameter blasting explosives, and the results were very good. Originally, one shot could only blast 1.2 meters deep, but now it can blast 1.6 meters deep. The Engineering Section also formulated some reward methods. Under these circumstances, the enthusiasm of the workers was high. From February 21st to 23rd, the youth commando team of Jiang Lijin's class in the auxiliary shaft created the highest record since the start of construction more than a year ago when removing slag. On February 24th, in the excavation of the 25th level roadway on the right, Yuan Wanxiang's class doubled the excavation efficiency and also supported two shed frames. The South Wing winch road project was also completed ahead of schedule in February.

　　However, at this time, things that disregarded production safety also began to happen. Safety regulations stipulate that workers can only go down the well fifteen minutes after the blast, but some workers go down the well immediately after the blast, and the inspectors' prohibition is ineffective. The workers excavating the 25th level roadway on the right proceeded despite the danger of gas. The leaders not only did not correct these wrong behaviors, but some even condoned them. For example, the safety regulations stipulate that tools are not allowed to be carried up and down the well. Jiang Jishen, the acting shift foreman of the auxiliary shaft, and Han Deming and other five people once carried ten wind hammers up from the well. When the inspector pointed out that this violated the safety regulations, Liu Eryuan, the deputy section chief of the auxiliary shaft, supported Jiang Jishen and others, saying: "I am responsible, you don't have to be afraid." The leaders of the Fengfeng Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Basic Construction Bureau of the Fengfeng Coal Mine also only pursued production "high tides" and neglected safety. Every time they called the grassroots units, they would ask: "Hey! Do you have a high tide there?" When they went to inspect and help with work, they would also ask "Is there a high tide?" They were happy when they heard there was a "high tide," and they were not very patient to listen to some of the problems raised by the comrades on the scene.

　　The tendency to ignore safety became more and more serious. At 6:00 p.m. on March 8th, when the auxiliary shaft was replacing the fourth pumping unit's cold steel (large parts), the cold steel should have been unloaded into the well, but the signal worker mistakenly pressed the hoisting bell. As a result, the cold steel bent a section of the pumping unit's pipe, stopping work for a total of twenty-three hours. However, the leaders of the auxiliary shaft still believed that it was not a major accident because no one was injured, and they did not pay attention to it ideologically. On March 10th, a major accident of bumping the hoisting bucket occurred again in the auxiliary shaft. Before this accident occurred, veteran worker Tian Kaihuai and shift foreman Song Qiugui pointed out to Liu Eryuan, the deputy section chief of the auxiliary shaft: "The South code collapsing rope is too loose, it should be tightened." Liu Eryuan did not consider this suggestion. Song Shangde, the safety team leader, also said to the acting shift foreman Han Deming: "The collapsing rope is too loose, you can't open the hook." Han Deming did not listen, and as a result, an accident occurred, injuring Wang Lijin, the pumping worker, and Wang Xueli and two other excavation workers.

　　Liu Eryuan's thinking, to a certain extent, represents the leadership's thinking. For example, at 7:35 p.m. on March 10th, the first accident of the main shaft's rock grabber head bumping the pumping unit occurred, which did not attract the attention of the leaders. Immediately afterwards, the second accident occurred, injuring six workers.

　　After the continuous accidents, the leaders of the Engineering Section felt that it was unsafe everywhere and panicked. These comrades should calmly analyze the situation and accept this lesson, neither being careless nor being paranoid.

    不要只追求“高潮”而忽视生产安全
    高永昌
    河北省峰峰煤矿基本建设局东大井工程处，从三月八日到十二日连续发生了七次事故，有十三人受伤。据三次大事故的统计，共停止生产七十一小时。
    东大井工程处过去是个常年完不成任务的落后单位。为了改变这个情况，工程处的领导人曾经想采用大直径爆破来提高效率，但是因为买不到大直径爆破炸药而没实现。二月一日，峰峰煤矿基本建设局召开经验交流会，副局长对东大井长期完不成计划提出了批评，并且要求东大井自己想办法找炸药，试验推行大直径爆破经验。会后，东大井工程处便用小直径爆破炸药来代替大直径爆破炸药，结果效力很好，原来放一次炮只爆破1.2公尺深，现在能爆破1.6公尺深。工程处还拟定了一些奖励的办法。在这些情况下，职工们的热情高涨，二月二十一日至二十三日，副井姜立金班的青年突击队在出砟的时候，创造开工一年多以来的最高纪录。二月二十四日，在正二十五平巷的掘进中，袁万祥班提高掘进效率一倍，还支了两架棚子。南翼绞车道工程也提前完成了二月份计划。
    但是，就在这个时候，不顾生产安全的事情也开始发生了。保安规程规定，放罢炮以后十五分钟才能下井，但是有些工人放罢炮就下井，检查人员制止也无效。在正二十五平巷掘进的工人们冒着瓦斯的危险掘进。领导人员不但不纠正这些错误行为，有的甚至纵容这种行为。例如保安规程上规定上下井不许携带工具，副井代理跟班姜继善和韩德明等五人，一次从井下就携带了十把风锤上来，检查人员指出这是违犯保安规程的时候，副井副段长刘二元便支持姜继善等说：“我负责任，你们不要害怕。”中共峰峰市委、峰峰煤矿基本建设局的领导人员也只追求生产“高潮”而忽视安全。他们每次给基层单位打电话都是问：“喂！你们那里有高潮没有？”他们去检查和帮助工作的时候，也都是问“有没有高潮。”听说有“高潮”便高兴，现场的同志提出一些问题，他们也不大耐心倾听。
    忽视安全的倾向越来越严重了。三月八日下午六点钟，副井换四号吊泵的冷钢（大零件），本来应该把冷钢卸到井下，而讯号工人错按了提升的电铃，结果冷钢把吊泵的管子碰弯一节，共停止工作二十三小时。但是，副井的领导人员还认为没伤人，不算大事故，思想上没引起注意。三月十日，副井又发生了碰吊桶的重大事故。在这次事故没发生以前，老工人田开怀、跟班宋秋贵就向副井的副段长刘二元指出：“南码崩绳太松，应该紧一紧。”刘二元没考虑这个意见。安全组长宋尚的又给代理跟班韩德明说：“崩绳太松，可不能开钩哇。”韩德明不听，结果就出事故，砸伤开泵工人王立金和掘进工人王学礼等三名。
    刘二元这种思想在一定程度上代表着领导思想。如三月十日晚上七点三十五分钟，主井第一次发生抓岩机头碰吊泵事故，没引起领导人员注意，紧接着就发生第二次事故，砸伤工人六名。
    事故连续发生以后，工程处的领导人员又感到处处都不安全，惊慌失措了。这些同志应该冷静地分析情况，接受这次教训，既不麻痹大意，也不要草木皆兵。
