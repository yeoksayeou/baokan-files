Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 5th. Saigon Dispatch: The Ngo Dinh Diem clique held its unilateral election in various parts of South Vietnam on March 4th, in violation of the Geneva Accords. On this day, at 6 o'clock in the morning, Saigon sounded a shrill air raid alarm to threaten people to vote. Voters were forced to line up in front of the polling stations, and then Ngo Dinh Diem elements and disguised secret agents took them in one by one to verify their documents and "vote." In areas where the working people lived, many people were unwilling to vote. On the same day, the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities dispatched a large number of trucks to forcibly transport them to the polling stations.

Despite this, many people resolutely resisted this unpopular election. Saigon Radio admitted that on the day of the "vote", the markets and streets of Saigon and Dike were not crowded, and young people and women did not go out. Therefore, the propaganda vehicles of Ngo Dinh Diem's "Psychological Warfare Bureau" extensively recruited people on the streets with free beer and cold drinks.

In other places far from Saigon, the practice of Ngo Dinh Diem elements forcing residents to vote was even more atrocious. In Soc Trang, Ngo Dinh Diem elements fired guns to threaten people to vote. In Nha Be near Saigon, Ngo Dinh Diem police shot and killed a person who was unwilling to vote.

    南越片面选举丑剧
    据新华社河内5日电  西贡消息：吴庭艳集团3月4日在南越各地举行了它的违反日内瓦协定的片面选举。这一天清晨6时，西贡就拉起了凄厉的空袭警报，威胁人们去投票。选民们被迫到投票站前去排队，然后由吴庭艳分子和化装的特务把他们一个个带进去交验证件和“投票”。在劳动人民居住的地区，有很多人不愿意去投票，吴庭艳当局在当天就出动了大批卡车把他们强迫运到投票站去。
    尽管如此，还有很多人对这个不得人心的选举表示坚决抵制。西贡电台承认，在“投票”当天，西贡、堤岸的市场和街道都不拥挤，青年和妇女都不上街。因此，吴庭艳的“心理作战局”的宣传车就在街头上用免费喝啤酒和冷饮品来广事招徕。
    在远离西贡的其他地方，吴庭艳分子强迫居民去投票的做法更是穷凶极恶。在朔庄，吴庭艳分子开枪威胁人民去投票。在西贡附近的芽?吴庭艳警察开枪打死了一个不愿去投票的人。
