    To Complete the Five-Year Coal Mining Task Ahead of Schedule Under Safe Production Conditions
    To the Editor:
    The young men of the Li Chang Youth Coal Mining Team of the Lifeng Mine, Jiaozuo Mining Bureau, recently proposed a guarantee to complete the first Five-Year Plan 15 months ahead of schedule.
    Almost all the workers in this team have families in the countryside. The overwhelming momentum of the peasants moving towards socialism inspires them to complete their work more, faster, better, and more economically. Team leader Li Chang said: The grain produced by our village's agricultural producers' cooperative is constantly increasing; we must also speed up production and run even faster! Based on the planned tasks from now until the end of 1957, they carefully calculated: each shift will produce 74 tons of coal, with an average full-member efficiency of 10.6 tons per worker, an increase of 61.3% over the national target; the tunneling efficiency will average 6.5 meters per shift, 85.6% higher than the national target. In this way, they will be able to complete the coal production task for the first Five-Year Plan period by the end of September this year; and strive to produce an additional 15,000 tons of raw coal. In terms of quality, the gangue content during extraction and tunneling will be reduced by 10% and 30% respectively. In order to achieve the new guarantee conditions, this year, in addition to continuing to promote double slotting, separate coal and gangue mining methods, three-fold mud gangue system, deep-hole blasting, and three-person mixed coal mining operations, they will also promote advanced experiences such as curved electric chutes, mixed work types, rapid groove connection, and voluntary material transportation. They will continue to implement team-based cost accounting, reducing the cost of pit wood by 40% during extraction and by 10% during tunneling; improving drilling technology, reducing the number of blasting operations, and reducing the consumption of explosives and detonators. Currently, their team has not had an accident for five years and eight months; in the future, they will study and resolutely implement safety regulations more carefully, and complete the task ahead of schedule under safe production conditions.

    要在安全生产的条件下提前完成五年采煤任务编辑同志：
    焦作矿务局李封矿李长青年采煤组的小伙子们，最近提出了提前15个月完成第一个五年计划的保证。
    这个小组的工人差不多家都在农村。农民奔向社会主义排山倒海的声势，鼓舞着他们更多、更快、更好、更省地完成自己的工作。组长李长说：俺村的农业生产合作社打的粮食不断增加；咱们在生产中也得快马加鞭，跑得更快些！他们根据眼前到1957年底的计划任务，细致地算了账：每班出74吨煤，全员效率每工平均10.6吨，比国家指标提高61.3％；掘进效率一班平均达6.5公尺，比国家指标高85.6％。这样，今年9月底能完成第一个五年计划期间的产煤任务；并要争取多出15，000吨原煤。在质量方面，回采中和掘进中的含矸率，要分别降低10％和30％。为了实现新的保证条件，他们今年除了要继续推广双掏槽、煤矸分采法、泥矸三折制、深孔爆破、三人采煤混合作业法以外，还要推广拐弯电溜子、混合工种、快速接槽、义务运料等先进经验。他们要继续推行班组成本经济核算，作到坑木成本在回采的时候降低40％，在掘进的时候降低10％；提高打眼技术，减少放炮次数，降低炸药和雷管的消耗。目前他们小组已经有五年零八个月没有发生事故；以后要更加认真地学习和坚决执行保安规程，在安全生产的条件下来提前完成任务。关志文
