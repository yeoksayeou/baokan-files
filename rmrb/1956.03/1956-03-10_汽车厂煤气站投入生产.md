    Automobile Factory Gas Station Put into Production
    The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant's second power center—the gas station—sent gas into the basic production workshops on the 9th. The melting of castings in the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant's foundry and non-ferrous casting workshop, the heating of forgings in the forging workshop, and the heat treatment of parts processed in various machining workshops all require gas. The newly put into production gas station will supply all the gas fuel required by dozens of heating inlets throughout the plant. This is of great importance to ensuring that the plant produces cars ahead of schedule. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    汽车厂煤气站投入生产
    第一汽车制造厂第二个动力中心——煤气站，9日把煤气送进了基本生产车间。第一汽车制造厂铸工、有色修铸车间熔化铸车件，锻工车间锻件加热，以及各个机械加工车间加工出零件的热处理，都需要煤气。新投入生产的煤气站，将使全厂几十个热力进口所需要的气体燃料全部得到供应。这对保证全厂提前出产汽车有着重大的作用。（据新华社讯）
