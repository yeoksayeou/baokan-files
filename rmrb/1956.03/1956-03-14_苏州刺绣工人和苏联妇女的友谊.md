    Friendship Between Suzhou Embroidery Workers and Soviet Women

    The Suzhou Embroidery Art and Craft Production Cooperative recently sent two batches of embroidery products to the Soviet Union as gifts to two Soviet women from the Ukrainian Republic and the Ivanovo Oblast, respectively. These two Soviet women had written in October and November of last year, requesting information on embroidery techniques. To ensure that their Soviet friends could learn Suzhou embroidery techniques to their satisfaction, the members of the Embroidery Art and Craft Cooperative sent exquisitely embroidered bedspreads, screen panels, cushion covers, and tablecloths, along with embroidery frames, needles, embroidery floss, a book of embroidery samples, and a brief introduction to embroidery techniques. In accordance with the request of V. Kozlova from the Ivanovo Oblast in her letter, they also introduced cooperative members Gu Wenxia and Ye Suzhen to her, maintaining regular correspondence and exchanging techniques.

    苏州刺绣工人和苏联妇女的友谊
    苏州市刺绣美术工艺生产合作社，最近把两批刺绣品寄往苏联，分别赠送给乌克兰共和国和伊凡诺夫省的两位苏联妇女。这两位苏联妇女曾在去年10月、11月间先后来信，要求介绍刺绣技术。刺绣美术工艺社的社员为了使苏联友人能够满意地学到苏州刺绣技术，除寄去了精工绣成的被罩、屏条、靠垫、台毯外，还附寄了刺绣需用的绷架、绣针、花线，以及一本刺绣样品簿和一本刺绣技术简要介绍书。他们并按照伊凡诺夫省伐·郭兹罗娃来信的要求，给她介绍社员顾文霞和叶素珍，保持经常的通信关系，交流技术。（本报驻南京记者）
