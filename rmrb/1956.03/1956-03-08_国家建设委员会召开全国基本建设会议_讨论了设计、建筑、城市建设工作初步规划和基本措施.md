Xinhua News Agency, 7th. The National Construction Commission convened the first National Basic Construction Conference from February 22nd to March 4th to strive for the early completion of the basic construction tasks of the First Five-Year Plan and to prepare for the basic construction work of the Second Five-Year Plan. The conference focused on discussing preliminary plans for design, construction, and urban construction work in the coming years, as well as basic measures to achieve these plans and improve current basic construction work.

    Bo Yibo, Director of the National Construction Commission, delivered a report at the beginning of the conference entitled "Striving to Complete the Basic Construction Tasks of the First Five-Year Plan Ahead of Schedule." In his report, he described the great achievements of basic construction work in recent years and gave a detailed explanation of how to implement the policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical" in order to complete the more arduous basic construction tasks in the future.

    Participants at the conference had a high degree of confidence in striving to complete the basic construction tasks of the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. They actively put forward methods and suggestions for improving work in all aspects and exchanged many good experiences.

    During the discussion of design work, everyone agreed that Bo Yibo's proposal to fundamentally improve China's design level, so that China's design forces can basically independently undertake the design tasks of various sectors of the national economy within 5 to 7 years, and strive to make China's design level close to and reach the world's advanced level by the end of the Third Five-Year Plan, is entirely possible. Many methods were proposed to strengthen the design forces and improve the working conditions of design. It was believed that one of the fastest ways to achieve results under the current conditions is to vigorously compile and promote standard designs and plan to reuse more economical and reasonable designs in large quantities. The conference estimated that in 1956, it was decided to promote 8 standard designs in civil buildings. If their adoption rate is 70%, it would be equivalent to freeing up more than 3,800 designer-years of work. This year, 30 standard designs will be compiled, ready for use in 1957. If the adoption rate is 80%, it will be equivalent to freeing up more than 7,000 designer-years of work. Reusing drawings will also save a lot of design manpower. The conference pointed out that the design institutes affiliated to the Ministry of Coal Industry are expected to undertake more than 4,500 design projects this year. As a result of the exchange of drawings, 3,300 drawings can be reused, which can save more than 7,300 design workdays. The saving of design power can advance the design year, and a large number of design documents can be prepared for the next year this year. Design institutions can extract a certain number of designers as early as possible to study and master complete sets of designs, or strengthen the design power of weak links. The construction department can prepare for construction as early as possible, shorten the construction time, and reduce waste.

    The conference pointed out that in the past few years, industrial and transportation departments have begun to pay attention to the method of adopting standard designs and reusing drawings. The Ministry of Light Industry and the Ministry of Textile Industry have saved 160,000 design workdays in the past three years as a result of adopting this method. However, many units still do not pay much attention to this method. Therefore, the conference proposed that the 552 standard designs in industry, agriculture, transportation, housing, and cultural welfare that have been determined to be compiled this year must be guaranteed to be completed by all design departments and relevant leading agencies by taking all measures. In terms of civil buildings, standard designs for residential and public buildings with large construction volume and all that can be standardized should be compiled in the next two years, so that they can be widely promoted in 1957 and 1958. By 1958, most of the houses, middle schools, and other public buildings should be constructed according to standard designs. In the industrial field, the existing Soviet standard designs should be quickly sorted out, and new standard design materials and drawings should be actively obtained from the Soviet side; and together with China's existing standard designs, a catalog should be compiled for mass promotion and use.

    The conference pointed out that in order to strengthen the work of standard design, it is also necessary to compile the standard designs of the main structures and components of industrial and civil buildings within one or two years, and quickly compile the regulations and ordinances for the compilation and approval of relevant standard designs.

    The conference believes that improving the management system of design institutions and the working system of design institutions, improving the utilization rate of working hours, improving the quality of design, and improving the labor productivity of designers are another important way to improve China's design work. The conference pointed out that the utilization rate of working hours in general design institutions is very low, only about 70%. There are too many non-production personnel in many design institutions, which often account for 30% of the total number of design institutions. Many design tasks are issued slowly, the plans are not thorough, and the phenomena of idleness and duplication of work between design institutions often occur, which wastes a lot of manpower. The conference believes that if this situation is changed, the existing design forces can be greatly strengthened.

    The conference also called for simplifying the compilation methods of design documents and budget documents; strengthening resource exploration and survey and measurement of design basic data such as hydrogeology and engineering geology.

    The conference also analyzed the current situation of China's design work, believing that the design cannot keep up with the requirements of construction, which is still one of the prominent problems in China's basic construction. The backwardness of China's design work is mainly manifested in the fact that it cannot independently undertake all the design tasks of industrial construction, and many important enterprises, such as large-scale metallurgical complexes, technically complex chemical industries, heavy and precision machinery manufacturing plants, and large-capacity and high-voltage thermal power plants, cannot be designed. And what China can design, whether it is industrial, agricultural, transportation, and water conservancy projects, cannot keep up with the needs of construction, and the quality is not high enough. Therefore, the conference required that China's designers should work hard to learn technical skills, and the relevant leading departments should organize them to study abroad and learn from Soviet experts in China in a planned way, and through the practice of design, sum up experience well and quickly improve their technical and business level.

    During the discussion of construction work, the conference believed that the industrialization of construction is the basic direction of China's construction industry. However, due to the shortage of construction machinery and liquid fuel production in China, it is too late to train and supply a large number of talents who can skillfully master construction machinery, and at the same time, China has the conditions of a large labor force. Therefore, in the process of realizing the industrialization of construction, it is necessary to separately determine the level of construction mechanization and the speed of development of different key projects and civil buildings.

    The conference believes that in order to ensure that industrial construction, especially heavy industrial construction, can be carried out more, faster, better and more economically, active steps must be taken for the heavy labor in all key projects, namely important industrial plants, mines, large bridges, dams, tunnel projects, etc., and mechanical construction should be done as soon as possible. The level of mechanization should be higher and the speed should be faster. For general projects and housing, civil buildings, etc., in addition to continuing to promote small and medium-sized mechanical construction, more attention should be paid to giving full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses of employees, improving labor skills, improving tools, and improving labor organization to complete construction tasks.

    In order to adapt to the growing demand for construction machinery in the future, the conference called for giving full play to the equipment capacity of existing construction machinery enterprises and increasing production; requiring the planned construction, reconstruction, and designation of some factories to specialize in the manufacture of construction machinery. The construction machinery manufacturing industry department and the construction department should have a division of labor. At the same time, attention should be paid to giving full play to the effectiveness of existing construction machinery and equipment, and strengthening the management and maintenance of construction machinery and equipment.

    The conference believes that with the progress of construction industrialization, various types of prefabricated factories should also be established in a planned and step-by-step manner. Prefabricated factories will take three forms: one is a regional permanent prefabricated factory, whose products can supply the needs of construction sites in a larger area; the degree of mechanization can be higher. The second is a prefabricated factory in a city, whose products only supply the needs of construction sites in the city; the degree of mechanization can be lower. In southern areas, open-air prefabricated factories should be established. There is also a construction site where the amount of work is not large and there is not much development. Some temporary open-air prefabricated factories can be established, as long as there are some necessary machines.

    This conference also discussed the production of building materials in the construction field. The conference believes that since this spring, the supply of building materials has been very tight. With the further expansion of the scale of basic construction, the demand for building materials will increase. Producing more varieties, better quality, more quantity, and low-priced building materials is an important task in the future.

    The conference called for vigorously saving various valuable materials in future construction, especially steel and wood. The conference introduced many methods and experiences in saving building materials. The power industry department will use cement poles for more than 1,900 kilometers of transmission lines built this year, which can save about 7,600 tons of steel. The scope of using reinforced concrete to replace wood and steel is very wide. The conference believes that especially railway sleepers, mine pit supports, transmission lines and communication lines used for wiring towers, utility poles, etc. should first be replaced with reinforced concrete.

    The conference called for the development of high-efficiency and diverse building material production; making full use of the local building materials that have been used for a long time in our country and have proven to be of excellent quality.

    This conference also discussed the issue of setting up design and construction institutions in accordance with the principle of specialization. It is believed that: Due to the ever-changing requirements of basic construction for design and construction departments in the future, it is difficult to complete new tasks without a large number of talents who are proficient in the technical business of this industry and specialized institutions. The conference believes that the one-stop nature of some institutions in the past has objective reasons. Now the design and construction departments have trained a certain number of cadres, and the leaders have a certain amount of management experience. The conditions for setting up institutions according to the principle of specialization have been largely available and should be gradually realized.

    The conference also discussed the issue of improving labor productivity and, on the basis of improving labor productivity, appropriately increasing workers' wages and improving workers' welfare.

    This conference focused on pointing out when discussing strengthening the construction of new industrial zones and new industrial cities: From now on, regional planning work must be carried out quickly in order to prepare for the large number of newly built industrial enterprises and new industrial cities during the Second Five-Year Plan and the Third Five-Year Plan.

    The conference pointed out that regional planning is a very complex technical and economic survey and comprehensive planning work. In the past, everyone had no experience in this area, so it is necessary to strengthen leadership, study hard, and require an overall concept and close cooperation.

    The conference pointed out that the most important issue when preparing regional plans is to rationally distribute industrial enterprises and cities. When determining the distance between factories and factories, industrial zones and industrial zones, we should pay good attention to the principle of taking into account both national defense and economy. The conference believes that if the regional plan is well done, the difficult situation of choosing industrial plant sites in the past can be greatly improved, and the time can be greatly accelerated.

    This conference also discussed issues such as scientific and technological research and improving leadership style and leadership methods.

    This conference has always been guided by the spirit of "more, faster, better, and more economical" during the discussion process. It is believed that more, faster, better, and more economical are comprehensive and unified things, which is especially obvious in basic construction. The conference analyzed the implementation of the spirit of "more, faster, better, and more economical" in basic construction in the past, believing that achievements have been made in many aspects. But at the same time, some one-sided practices were criticized. The conference pointed out that balanced construction is the most important thing in shortening the construction period, but it has been done poorly in this regard in the past few years. In the past three years, the amount of work completed in each quarter, the highest in the first quarter (1955) was only 11%, while the fourth quarter reached 35% or 41% in previous years. This has caused a large amount of rush work and idleness, a large amount of waste, the quality of the project is often difficult to guarantee, and the time for the project to be put into production has been delayed. The conference believes that in basic construction, good is the foundation of more, faster, and more economical. All projects without quality, more, faster, and more economical are meaningless. The conference pointed out that in the past few years, especially since the launch of the comprehensive conservation movement last year, various places have achieved many achievements in saving state funds. However, there are also many places where the low quality of many projects has been caused as a result of one-sided savings.

    The conference pointed out that there are still many wasteful phenomena on construction sites. For example, waste in the storage, transportation, and use of raw materials, waste in rework, large-scale damage to tools and machinery, idleness of transportation machinery, and unreasonable labor organization are still common.

    Therefore, the conference believes that it is a very important issue to correctly and comprehensively implement the principle of "more, faster, better, and more economical" in future basic construction work.

    Bo Yibo made a concluding report at the conference. He pointed out that there are many facts to prove that the potential power that can be tapped in China's basic construction work is very huge, the tricks are endless, and there is a guarantee for carrying out basic construction more, faster, better, and more economically and completing the first five-year plan ahead of schedule.

    During the conference, Chen Yu, Minister of Coal Industry, Wang Heshou, Minister of Heavy Industry, Liu Xiufeng, Minister of Construction Engineering, Liu Lanbo, Minister of Power Industry, Li Jukui, Minister of Petroleum Industry, Teng Daiyuan, Minister of Railways, He Changgong, Deputy Minister of Geology, Li Yu, Deputy Minister of the First Ministry of Machinery Industry, Li Baohua, Deputy Minister of Water Resources, Gao Wenhua, Deputy Minister of Light Industry, Wan Li, Director of the Urban Construction Bureau, and others made reports at the conference.

    A total of 792 people attended the conference. They exchanged experiences widely at the meeting. The main experiences include: the use of standard designs in design, the training of designers, the improvement of design methods, learning to independently carry out complete sets of designs for large enterprises, and technical and economic work in design; parallel cross-operations in construction, rapid flow operations, expansion of combinations, improvement of combination rate, comprehensive installation methods, and specialized construction; saving building materials, the use of high-efficiency building materials in the use of dry hard concrete, high-efficiency steel bars, welded steel bars and steel frames, and regional management of building materials.

    More than 70 Soviet experts also attended the conference.

    Before the end of the conference, Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China also took a photo with all the people attending the meeting.

    国家建设委员会召开全国基本建设会议
    讨论了设计、建筑、城市建设工作初步规划和基本措施
    新华社7日讯为争取提前完成第一个五年计划的基本建设任务，并且为第二个五年计划的基本建设工作作好准备，国家建设委员会在2月22日到3月4日召开了全国第一次基本建设会议，着重讨论了关于设计工作、建筑工作、城市建设工作在今后若干年内的初步规划，以及实现这些规划和改进当前基本建设工作的基本措施。
    国家建设委员会主任薄一波在会议开始的时候，作了“为提前完成第一个五年计划的基本建设任务而努力”的报告。他在报告中，叙述了几年来基本建设工作的巨大成就，对于完成今后更加繁重的基本建设任务，贯彻执行又多又快又好又省的方针，作了详细的说明。
    参加会议的人对于争取提前完成第一个五年计划的基本建设任务有着很高的信心，他们积极提出了改进各方面工作的办法和建议，交流了许多很好的经验。
    会议在讨论设计工作的时候，大家认为：薄一波提出的为了从根本上提高我国设计水平，在5年到7年的时间内，使我国的设计力量能够基本上独立地担负起国民经济各部门的设计任务，并且争取在第三个五年计划期末使我国的设计水平接近和达到世界的先进水平，是完全可能的。大家提出了许多增强设计力量和改善设计工作状况的办法。认为在目前条件下见效最快的办法之一，是大力编制和推广标准设计，有计划地大量地重复使用比较经济合理的设计。会议预计，1956年决定在民用建筑中推广8项标准设计，假使它们的采用率是70％，就等于腾出3，800多设计人员一年的工作日。今年将编制出30项标准设计，准备在1957年使用，如果采用率是80％，将等于腾出7，000多个设计人员一年的工作日。重复使用图纸，也会大量地节省设计力量。会议指出，煤炭工业部所属各设计院，在今年所担负的设计项目预计为4，500多项，经过交流图纸的结果，有3，300项图纸可以重复使用，这样就可以节省出7，300多个设计工作日。设计力量的节约，能够使设计年度提前，本年度可以为下年度编制出大量的设计文件。设计机构中得以及早抽出一定数量的设计人员去学习和掌握成套的设计，或加强薄弱环节的设计力量。施工部门可以及早进行施工准备，缩短工程建设时间，减少浪费。
    会议指出，在过去几年中，工业和交通部门已经开始注意了采用标准设计和重复使用图纸的办法。轻工业部和纺织工业部三年来由于采用这个办法的结果，就节省了16万个设计工作日。但是，也有许多单位仍然很不注意这一办法。因此，会议提出：今年已经确定编制的工业、农业、交通、住宅和文化福利等方面的552项标准设计，各设计部门和有关领导机关必须采取一切办法来保证完成。在民用建筑方面，应该争取在今明两年内把建筑量较大的和一切可以标准化的住宅以及公共建筑物的标准设计编制出来，以便在1957年和1958年大量推广。到1958年，做到绝大部分的住宅、中等学校和其他公共建筑都能按照标准设计施工。在工业方面，应该迅速清理已有的苏联标准设计，积极从苏联方面取得新的标准设计资料和图纸；并且同我国已有的标准设计一起编出目录，以便大量推广使用。
    会议指出，为了加强标准设计的工作，还必须在一两年内编制出工业和民用建筑的主要结构和构件的标准设计，并且迅速把有关标准设计的编制、审批的规章、条例编制出来。
    会议认为，改善对设计机构的管理制度和设计机构的工作制度，提高工时利用率，提高设计的质量，提高设计人员劳动生产率，是改善我国设计工作的另一重要办法。会议指出，目前一般设计机构中的工时利用率都很低，大约只达到70％。有许多设计机构的非生产人员过多，它们往往占整个设计机构总人数的30％。有许多设计任务下达迟缓，计划不周，窝工现象和各设计机构之间的重复工作现象都经常出现，这些都浪费了很多的人力。会议认为，如果把这种状况加以改变，就可以大大加强现有的设计力量。
    会议还要求简化设计文件和预算文件的编制方法；加强资源的勘探和设计基础资料如水文地质、工程地质等的勘察测量工作。
    会议还分析了目前我国设计工作状况，认为设计赶不上建设的要求，仍然是我国基本建设中的突出问题之一。我国设计工作的落后状况，主要表现在不能独立地担负起工业建设的全部设计任务，许多重要的企业如大型冶金联合企业、技术复杂的化学工业、重型的和精密的机械制造厂、大容量高压的火力发电站等都不能设计。而我国能够设计的，不论是工业、农业、交通和水利工程等也都赶不上建设的需要，而且质量都不够高。因此，会议要求我国的设计人员应该努力学习技术业务，要求有关领导部门有计划地组织他们出国和向在中国的苏联专家学习，通过设计的实践，很好地总结经验，迅速提高技术业务水平。
    会议在讨论建筑工作的时候，认为建筑工业化是我国建筑业的基本方向。但是由于我国目前的建筑机械和液体燃料生产不足，大批地培养和供给能够熟练地掌握建筑机械的人才一时还来不及，同时，我国又有劳动力众多的条件。因此在实现建筑工业化的过程中，需要分别确定重点工程和民用建筑等不同的施工机械化水平，不同的发展速度。
    会议认为，为了保证工业建设特别是重工业建设能够又多又快又好又省地进行，对一切重点工程，即重要的工业厂房、矿井、大的桥梁、水坝、隧道工程等方面的笨重劳动，必须采取积极的步骤，尽先做到机械化施工，机械化的水平应该高一些，速度也应该快一点。一般工程和住宅、民用建筑等，除继续推行中小型机械施工外，应该多注意发挥职工群众的积极性和创造性，提高劳动熟练程度，改良工具，改进劳动组织以完成建筑任务。
    为了适应今后对建筑机械需要日益增长的情况，会议要求充分发挥现有建筑机械企业的设备能力，提高生产；要求有计划地新建、改建和指定一些工厂专门制造建筑机械。建筑机械制造工业部门和建筑部门应该有所分工。同时注意充分发挥现有建筑机械设备的效能，加强建筑机械设备的管理和维修等工作。
    会议认为，随着建筑工业化的进展，还应该有计划、有步骤地建立各种类型的预制工厂。预制工厂将采取三种形式：一种是区域性的永久性的预制厂，它的产品可以供应较大范围内建筑工地的需要；机械化程度可以高一些。一种是一个城市内的预制厂，它的产品只供给市内各建筑工地的需要；机械化程度可以低一些。在南方地区，应该设立露天预制厂。还有一种是工程量不大，又没有多大发展的工地，可以建立一些临时性的露天预制厂，只要有一些必要的机器就够了。
    这次会议在建筑方面，还讨论了建筑材料的生产问题。会议认为，今春以来，建筑材料的供应情况已经十分紧张。随着基本建设规模的进一步扩大，对建筑材料的要求将越来越多。生产品种更多、质量更好、数量更多和价格低廉的建筑材料，是今后的重要任务。
    会议要求在今后的建筑中大力节约各种贵重材料，特别是钢材和木材。会议上介绍了许多节约建筑材料的办法和经验。电力工业部在今年内修建的输电线路，其中1，900多公里路线将采用水泥杆，大约可以节省钢材7，600吨。用钢筋混凝土代替木材和钢材的范围很广，会议认为尤其是铁路轨枕、矿坑支架、输电线路和通讯线路用的架线塔、电线杆等都应该首先用钢筋混凝土来代替。
    会议要求发展高效能的和多种的建筑材料生产；充分利用我国用之已久，证明质地优良的地方建筑材料。
    这次会议还讨论了按照专业化的原则设置设计和施工机构的问题。认为：由于今后基本建设方面将对设计和施工部门提出日新月异的要求，没有大批精通本行技术业务的人才和专门的机构，是很难完成新的任务的。会议认为过去某些机构的一揽子性质，是有着客观原因的。现在设计和施工部门已经培养出一定数量的干部，领导人员也有了一定的管理经验，按照专业化原则设置机构的条件已经大体具备，应该逐步实现。
    会议还讨论了提高劳动生产率和在提高劳动生产率的基础上，适当提高职工工资和改善职工福利问题。
    这次会议在讨论加强新工业区和新工业城市建设工作的时候，着重指出：从现在开始，必须迅速开展区域规划工作，以便为第二个五年计划和第三个五年计划期间大量新建的工业企业和新建工业城市作好准备。
    会议指出，区域规划是十分复杂的技术经济调查和综合规划的工作。过去大家对这一方面都没有经验，因此必须加强领导，认真学习，并且要求有整体观念，密切配合。
    会议指出，在编制区域规划的时候，最重要的问题是对工业企业和城市进行合理分布。在确定工厂和工厂、工业区和工业区间的距离的时候，应该很好注意到国防和经济兼顾的原则。会议认为，区域规划作好了，过去选择工业厂址的那种困难状况就可以大大改善，时间也可以大大加快。
    这次会议还讨论到关于科学技术研究工作和改进领导作风和领导方法等问题。
    这次会议在讨论过程中，始终贯彻着又多又快又好又省的精神。认为多、快、好、省是全面的统一的东西，这在基本建设中表现得尤其明显。会议分析了过去在基本建设中贯彻又多又快又好又省的精神的情况，认为在许多方面已经做出了成绩。但同时也批判了某些片面的作法。会议指出，均衡施工在缩短工期中居于首要地位，但是几年来在这方面做得很差。三年中各季完成的工作量，第一季度最高的（1955年）只达11％，而第四季度却历年达到35％或41％。这样就造成了大量的赶工窝工，发生了大量的浪费现象，工程的质量也往往难于保证，并且拖延了工程投入生产等的时间。会议认为，在基本建设中好是多、快、省的基础，一切工程离开了质量，多、快、省便没有意义。会议指出，几年来，特别是去年开展全面节约运动以来，各地在节约国家资金方面获得许多成绩。但是，也有许多地方由于片面节约的结果，造成了很多工程质量低劣的现象。
    会议指出，在建筑工地上，目前仍然存在着很多的浪费现象。比如原材料的储存、运输和使用方面的浪费，返工的浪费，工具机械的大量损坏，运输机械的窝工、劳动组织不合理等等都还普遍存在。
    因此，会议认为，在今后的基本建设工作中，正确地、全面地贯彻又多又快又好又省的原则，是十分重要的问题。
    会议由薄一波做总结报告。他指出，有很多的事实证明，在我国基本建设工作中可以挖掘的潜在力量是十分巨大的，窍门是无尽的，又多又快又好又省地进行基本建设，提前完成第一个五年计划是有保证的。
    在会议期间，煤炭工业部部长陈郁、重工业部部长王鹤寿、建筑工程部部长刘秀峰、电力工业部部长刘澜波、石油工业部部长李聚奎、铁道部部长滕代远、地质部副部长何长工、第一机械工业部副部长黎玉、水利部副部长李葆华、轻工业部副部长高文华、城市建设总局局长万里等人都在大会上作了报告。
    参加这次会议的共有792人。他们在会上广泛地交流了经验。其中主要的经验有：设计方面的采用标准设计，培养设计人员，改进设计方法，学会独立进行大型企业的成套设计，以及设计中的技术经济工作等；施工方面的平行交叉作业，快速流水作业，扩大组合体、提高组合率，综合安装法，以及专业化施工等；节约建筑材料、使用高效能的建筑材料方面的使用干硬性混凝土，高效能钢筋、焊接钢筋和钢骨架，以及建筑材料的区域管理等。
    参加这次会议的，还有70多位苏联专家。
    会议结束以前，中华人民共和国毛泽东主席还同到会的全体人员照了相。
