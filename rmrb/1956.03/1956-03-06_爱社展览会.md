The Shuangmiao Township Agricultural Cooperative in Xiangcheng County, Henan Province, held such an exhibition in early February. The exhibition displayed many objects representing two kinds of thinking and two kinds of behavior. There were two live cattle representing good and bad feeding conditions: one was fat and strong, the other was covered in mange and emaciated; there were also many farm tools: there was the "free lifting and lowering water cart frame" created by outstanding cooperative member Cao Changhai during the well-digging campaign, and there were also various farm tools damaged by some irresponsible cooperative members; there were also 11 pictures and cartoons, some praising model cooperative members who took the lead in digging in the mud, and some criticizing cooperative members who were opportunistic and didn't work hard in production.

These concrete and vivid exhibits profoundly demonstrated the lovableness and respectfulness of the collectivist thinking and behavior of those model cooperative members who loved the cooperative, and the ugliness and harm of the selfish and self-serving thinking and behavior of those irresponsible cooperative members. This exhibition was a very good collectivist education for the cooperative members, and played a great role in promoting the current cooperative rectification work and spring plowing preparation work.

    爱社展览会
    河南襄城县双庙乡农业合作社，在2月上旬举行了这么一次展览会。在会上展出了代表两种思想、两种行为的许多实物。这里有代表好、坏两种喂养情况的两头活牛：一头肥大健壮，一头满身癞疮，骨瘦如柴；还有许多农具：有优秀社员曹长海在打井运动中创造的“自由升降水车架”，也有一些不负责任的社员损坏的各种农具；还有11幅图片和漫画，其中有的表扬带头下水挖坑泥的模范社员，有的批评在生产中投机取巧不好好劳动的社员。
    这些具体、生动的展览品，深刻地表现出了那些爱社的模范社员的集体主义思想和行为的可爱和可敬，那些不负责任的社员的自私自利思想和行为的丑恶和危害。这次展览会对社员是一种很好的集体主义教育，对当前的整社工作和春耕准备工作起了很大的推动作用。
