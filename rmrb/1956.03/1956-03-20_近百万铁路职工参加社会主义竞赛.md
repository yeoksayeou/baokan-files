    Nearly One Million Railway Workers Participate in Socialist Emulation Drive
    Nearly one million workers in the railway system are now participating in the socialist emulation drive.
    Due to the active participation of the vast number of workers in the socialist emulation drive, the wave of exceeding quotas and revising backward quotas has spread to all departments of the national railway system. According to incomplete statistics, workers have exceeded quotas 52,750 times. Many newly revised quotas have also been exceeded by the workers.
    Currently, several major production indicators of the railway department have exceeded the state-stipulated targets for 1957. In terms of new railway construction, the masses have created new experiences in accelerating tunnel breakthroughs, which has solved the key problem of speeding up the construction of new railways. Therefore, there is confidence in completing the state's First Five-Year Plan for new railway construction ahead of schedule and exceeding the target.

    近百万铁路职工参加社会主义竞赛
    铁路系统目前已经有近一百万职工参加了社会主义竞赛。
    由于广大职工积极参加社会主义竞赛，突破定额和修改落后定额的浪潮已经波及全国铁路的各个部门。据不完全统计，职工们已经突破定额52，750件。许多新修订的定额，也被职工们突破了。
    目前，铁路部门有几种主要生产指标都超过了国家规定的一九五七年的指标。新建铁路方面也由于群众创造了加快打通隧道的新经验，解决了加快新铁路的建设速度的关键问题，因此有把握提前和超额完成国家第一个五年计划规定的新建铁路计划。
