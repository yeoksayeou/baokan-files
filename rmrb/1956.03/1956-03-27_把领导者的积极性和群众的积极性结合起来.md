Combining the Initiative of Leaders and the Initiative of the Masses
Song Zheng

If the initiative of leading cadres can be combined with the initiative of the broad masses of workers, it can guide the soaring enthusiasm of the masses in the right direction and quickly generate enormous material strength. If leading cadres are active behind closed doors in the office, and the broad masses of workers are active in the workshop, without communication between upper and lower levels, everyone's initiative cannot be well utilized, and conservative ideas cannot be truly overcome. The situation of Shanghai's joint state-private Huatong Switch Factory in formulating this year's annual plan well illustrates this issue.

Under the encouragement and promotion of the high tide of socialist transformation and the Party Central Committee's call to oppose right-leaning conservative thinking and strive to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, the initiative of the leading cadres and workers of the Huatong Switch Factory soared unprecedentedly. After studying the Party's instructions and criticizing conservative ideas, the administrative leaders were determined to make the plan more advanced. To formulate an advanced plan, they repeatedly assessed and calculated, and selected more than 20 cadres to concentrate in the factory headquarters specifically to formulate the plan. Although the leading cadres subjectively wanted to make the plan as advanced as possible and set even higher output value targets than required by the state, they encountered difficulties in formulating the plan. Everyone had great concerns about increasing labor productivity. The state required labor productivity to increase by another 24% compared to the actual figures completed last year. If the factory's own target of striving for increased production was followed, labor productivity would have to be about 30.14% higher than last year's actual completion. In the past, it only increased by a few percentage points each year. Was it possible to increase so much this year? Savings and cost plans also could not be compiled. The Shanghai Municipal Party Committee required the factory to save 1.5 million yuan this year. Last year, the vigorous increase production and practice economy campaign in the fourth quarter only saved more than 400,000 yuan. Everyone felt it was difficult to save so much again this year. As a result, the plan went around in circles in the departments and could not be compiled in the end.

Problems also existed among the masses. The workers' morale was high. At the commendation and award meetings, workers lined up to speak, and the conference received more than 300 group and individual guarantees to overfulfill the plan. However, many of the individual guarantees made by the workers were low, and some were even lower than last year's actual completion. Some leading cadres saw that the plans proposed by the masses were not advanced enough, and they had even more concerns. The workers' actions were so active, but the individual guarantees were low. What was the reason? The Party committee immediately conducted investigations and research among the masses and found that the masses had concerns. The main concerns of the masses were that they were afraid that rationalization proposals and learning advanced experiences would not receive the support of the leadership, resulting in the failure of advanced plans. At the same time, because the factory's production targets and variety plans had not been announced, the masses did not know what work to do and how much to do, so it was not easy to specifically tap potential and propose advanced individual plans.

The Party Committee specifically analyzed this situation. It believed that the key to not being able to compile the plan was that there was no communication between the leadership and the masses. Therefore, according to the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee, the Party Committee proposed that they could no longer compile the plan behind closed doors. They must hand over the indicators to the masses for discussion, and they must resolutely support the masses in making rationalization proposals and learning advanced experiences.

The Party Committee decided to combine the initiative of the masses and the initiative of the leadership through the employee representative conference held in early February.

This employee representative conference changed the past practice of leaders speaking more and the masses speaking less. After the leaders announced the increased production targets, the main measures to increase production, and expressed firm support for everyone to make rationalization proposals and firmly support the promotion of advanced experience, they left the main time for the representatives to discuss, and adopted the method of alternating representative discussions and mass discussions. At the same time, they organized department personnel to participate in the discussions of the workshops, so that the workshop plans and the department plans could be closely linked. Department personnel participated in the discussions of the workshops, and the department work was further combined with the requirements of the workshops. The masses wanted to increase the speed of the machines, so the electromechanical department quickly proposed a plan to modify the lathes; the masses had many opinions on the technology department, so the technology department decided to assign dedicated personnel to contact the workshops separately, listen to the opinions of the workshops, and improve their work.

The combination of leaders and the masses, and the combination of departments and workshops, not only greatly increased the enthusiasm of the masses, but also rapidly improved the work of the departments. The leaders were also full of confidence in completing various advanced indicators, and the masses generally put forward advanced individual plans that were much higher than the leaders required. Taking the first workshop as an example: the leadership required fitters to complete the plan 90 days ahead of schedule. After discussion, they could complete it 103 days ahead of schedule. The leadership required turners to complete the plan 90 days ahead of schedule. The discussion result was that they could complete it 97 days ahead of schedule. The leadership required punchers to complete the plan 40 days ahead of schedule. The masses believed that they could complete it 60 days ahead of schedule. The situation in other types of work and other workshops was the same. One worker said that based on his technical level, he had no confidence in reaching the target, and others immediately expressed their willingness to help him strive to overfulfill the plan. A worker with higher technical skills had opinions on the work of selecting advanced workers, and said angrily in the discussion: "I am not an advanced producer, and I cannot reach the target." Everyone immediately criticized him for saying that it was wrong, and that he should be realistic, and overfulfill as much as he could.

During the employee representative conference and the workshop mass discussions, many criticisms were also made of the leadership's past failure to actively support rationalization proposals and promote advanced technologies. More than 1,000 rationalization proposals and opinions were put forward, and methods for handling rationalization proposals at different levels were proposed. The leadership immediately accepted the methods proposed by the masses, which significantly improved the handling of rationalization proposals. In this way, some indicators could be broken through after discussion by the masses. For example, the labor productivity target. During the discussion, the masses expressed that they were confident of increasing it by 30.14%. This finally overcame the conservative thinking of the leadership and made the leaders more aware of the importance of relying on the masses. The situation of completing the February plan also made everyone more confident. In February, the total output value completed 138% of the state plan, labor productivity completed 136.11%, and the quality also reached the target. Only because of the difficulty of material supply, the variety plan was not completed.

Difficulties and problems still exist. Not only are there difficulties in materials and collaboration, but the management work and the Party's work are still not fully adapted to the unprecedentedly high enthusiasm of the masses, and the leadership is not paying enough attention to both good quality and economy. However, as long as the leadership can better grasp the policies, better combine with the masses, and further improve the management work, many problems can be gradually solved.

### 把领导者的积极性和群众的积极性结合起来

    把领导者的积极性和群众的积极性结合起来
    宋琤
    领导干部的积极性如果能够和广大职工群众的积极性结合起来，就能把群众的高涨的热情引导到正确的方向，迅速地产生出巨大的物质力量。如果领导干部关着门在办公室里积极，广大职工群众在车间里积极，上下不通气，大家的积极性就都不能很好地发挥，保守思想也就不能真正克服。上海公私合营华通开关厂制定今年年度计划的情况就很好地说明了这个问题。
    在社会主义改造高潮和党中央反对右倾保守思想争取提前完成五年计划的号召的鼓舞和推动下，华通开关厂的领导干部和职工群众的积极性空前高涨。行政领导干部们学习了党的指示，批判了保守思想以后，决心要把计划编制得更加先进。为了编制先进的计划，他们反复摸底计算，并且，抽调出二十多名干部集中在厂部专门编制计划。尽管领导干部主观上愿意尽量把计划定得更加先进，也确定了比国家要求的指标还更高的产值指标，但是，在编制计划中却发生了困难。大家对提高劳动生产率的顾虑很大。国家要求劳动生产率比去年实际完成的数字再提高24％。如果按照厂里自己确定的争取增产指标，劳动生产率就得比去年实际完成的高30.14％左右。过去每年只提高百分之几，今年一下子要提高这么多，到底有没有可能呢？节约和成本计划同样也编不下去。上海市委要求这个厂今年节约一百五十万元。去年第四季度轰轰烈烈地开展了增产节约运动，才节约四十多万元。今年再要节约这么多，大家都觉得困难。于是，计划就在科室里来回兜圈子，始终编不出来。
    群众中同样也存在着问题。工人的情绪很高，在评比给奖大会上，工人排着队争着要求发言，大会收到了三百多份小组和个人超额完成计划的保证。但是，很多工人定的个人保证计划却都偏低，个别的甚至比去年实际完成的还低。有些领导干部看到群众提的计划不够先进，顾虑就更多。工人们的行动那样积极，个人的保证计划又偏低，原因何在呢？党委即在群众中进行调查研究，发现群众有顾虑，群众主要顾虑是怕提合理化建议和学习先进经验得不到领导的支持，结果会使先进的计划落空。同时因为厂里的生产指标和品种计划没有宣布，群众不知道干什么活和干多少，也就不容易具体地挖掘潜力、提出先进的个人计划。
    党委会具体地分析了这种情况。认为计划编制不出来的关键就在于领导和群众没有通气。于是，根据市委的指示，党委会提出，不能再关起门来编计划了，必须把指标交给群众讨论，必须坚决支持群众提合理化建议和学习先进经验。
    党委决定通过二月初召开的职工代表大会，把群众的积极性和领导的积极性结合起来。
    这次职工代表大会改变了过去领导讲得多群众讲得少的开法，领导上宣布增产指标、增产的主要措施和表示坚决支持大家提合理化建议，坚决支持推广先进经验以后，即把主要时间留给代表讨论，并且采取了代表讨论和群众讨论交插进行的办法，同时组织科室人员参加车间群众的讨论，使车间的计划和科室的计划能密切衔接起来。科室人员参加了车间的讨论，科室工作就进一步和车间要求结合起来。群众要提高机器转数，机电科就很快地提出了改装车床的计划；群众对工艺科的意见很多，工艺科就确定专人分别和车间联系，听取车间意见，改进工作。
    领导和群众一结合，科室和车间一结合，不仅群众的积极性大大高涨起来，科室工作迅速得到了改进，领导上对完成各项先进指标也充满了信心，群众普遍提出了比领导要求高得多的先进的个人计划。以第一车间为例：领导方面要求钳工提前九十天完成计划，经过讨论，可以提前103天。领导方面要求车工提前九十天完成计划，讨论结果可以提前九十七天。领导方面要求冲工提前四十天完成计划，群众认为可以提前六十天。其他工种其他车间的情况也都同样。有一个工人说根据自己的技术水平，没有信心达到指标，别人立刻就表示要帮助他争取超额完成计划。有一个技术较高的工人因为对评选先进工作者的工作有意见，在讨论中睹气说：“我又不是先进生产者，达不到指标。”大家立刻批评他这样说不对，应该实事求是，能超额多少就超额多少。
    职工代表大会上和车间群众讨论中，还对领导上过去不积极支持合理化建议和推广先进技术作了很多批评，提出了一千多条合理化建议和意见，并且提出了分级处理合理化建议的办法。领导上立即接受了群众提出的办法，使得合理化建议的处理有了显著的改进。这样，有些指标，经过群众一讨论，就能够突破了。例如劳动生产率指标，在讨论中，群众表示有把握提高30.14％。这就最后克服了领导上的保守思想，使领导者更加体会到依靠群众的重要性。二月份计划完成的情况也使大家更有信心。二月份总产值完成国家计划的138％，劳动生产率完成136.11％，质量也达到了指标，只是因为材料供应的困难，而没有完成品种计划。
    困难和问题还是有的，不仅材料和协作方面有困难，管理工作和党的工作也都还不能完全适应群众的空前高涨的积极性，领导方面对好和省还注意不够。但是，只要领导方面能够更好地掌握政策，更好地和群众相结合，进一步改进管理工作，许多问题就都可以逐步地得到解决。
