Enterprise Party Organizations Should Pay Attention to the Work of Employee Dormitories
Du Yuchen

In order to maintain close ties with the worker masses and to do a good job in ideological education, enterprise Party organizations must not only carry out Party work on the production or construction site, but also go deep into the employee dormitories. On the production or construction site, workers are engaged in intense labor, and it is impossible for the Party organization to fully carry out Party work. However, by going deep into the employee dormitories in their spare time, they can calmly and individually talk with the employees, understand their ideological situation, and specifically help them solve problems in their lives, studies, or other aspects. Furthermore, by organizing amateur cultural and technical studies and recreational activities, they can carry out socialist education for them.

However, for a long time in the past, the Party organization of the Metal Structure Installation Engineering Company of the Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company forgot about the work of employee dormitories. The staff of the Party organization were busy all day long attending meetings in the office, reading reports, and distributing documents. Their contact with the workers was generally at meetings and on the construction site. Few Party cadres had been to the workers' dormitories in recent years; and even when they did contact the workers, they only talked about work in general, rarely talking about the workers' thoughts and lives. That is to say, the Party organization actually only managed the eight hours the workers were working, and not the sixteen hours they were in the dormitory. The Party organization demanded that the workers produce and work well, but did not care about the lives and studies of the employees.

It should be seen that abandoning dormitory work has brought great losses to the work of the Party organization, and has to some extent alienated the Party organization from the masses. After recently going deep into the employee dormitories, the Party organization of the Metal Structure Installation Engineering Company of the Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company discovered that because many problems related to the lives and studies of employees had not been solved for a long time, or had not been addressed at all, the worker masses had many opinions about the Party organization and the administration. The hygiene conditions in the Changdianpu Basic Construction Employee Dormitory were not good. For example, the kang mats had not been changed for a long time, and the sewers were broken and not repaired. The workers said that these problems had been reported countless times, but the Party organization and the administration did not solve them. The management of the employee cafeteria was also not good. There were many expensive dishes and too few cheap dishes. The variety and types of food were also too few, and workers had to wait a long time to buy food. The hygiene of the cafeteria was also terrible, with chopsticks that were black at one end and white at the other. Although the workers kept writing these opinions in the suggestion book, the cafeteria managers rarely made any improvements, and later even the suggestion book was cancelled. The Party organization did not pay attention to this. There were more than 4,000 single workers in the Changdianpu single workers' dormitory, and a total of more than 9,000 people including family members of the workers, but there was no centralized entertainment venue. The original two clubs had also been converted into paid theaters and cinemas under the guidance of the erroneous idea of unilaterally implementing the enterprise management policy. Many workers either slept, gambled, or read strange and bizarre novels such as "The Three Musketeers" after work. This clearly shows that because the Party organization did not carry out work in the employee dormitories, not only were some of the workers' personal problems not solved in a timely and correct manner, but the bourgeois ideology had the opportunity to spread and grow among the worker masses.

In order to eliminate the above-mentioned bad phenomena, the Party organization of the Metal Structure Installation Engineering Company recently conducted an inspection of the dormitory work in accordance with the instructions of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China. During the inspection, the company's Party organization made a self-criticism to the workers, and immediately cooperated with the enterprise administrative management department to improve the management of the cafeteria and dormitories, and strengthen the leadership of the workers' amateur cultural and technical studies and recreational activities. The Party organization absorbed representatives of the worker masses to form a cafeteria management committee, and quickly improved the cafeteria work. After the improvement, workers could eat hot meals, and workers on three shifts could eat as soon as they arrived. The variety of food has increased, from 11 side dishes to more than 20. The employees of each dormitory organized themselves, elected room representatives and group leaders, implemented a rotation duty system, and improved the cleanliness and hygiene of the rooms. Most dormitories have also installed loudspeakers and increased newspapers and entertainment facilities. After work, workers can freely participate in recreational activities. At present, relevant units are preparing to organize workers to study culture and technology.

Although the above-mentioned improvements in workers' lives and cultural and recreational activities are only just beginning, they have been warmly welcomed by the worker masses. After the cafeteria work was improved, more than 500 employees wrote letters praising the cafeteria. Many workers said that since the Party organization cared about them so much, they must work hard in production and work. These reactions from the worker masses are a good education for the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League leaders of the enterprise, and make these leaders further realize the importance of close ties between the Party organization and the worker masses, and the importance of caring about the lives of the worker masses.

    企业党组织要注意职工宿舍的工作
    杜玉臣
    企业的党组织为了经常保持同职工群众的紧密联系，为了做好对人的思想教育工作，不仅要在生产或施工的现场上，对职工群众进行党的工作，而且要深入职工宿舍进行工作。在生产或施工的现场上，工人从事着紧张的劳动，党组织是不可能充分地进行党的工作的；而在业余时间深入到职工宿舍中去，就可以从容不迫地、个别地和职工谈心，了解他们的思想情况，具体地帮助他们解决生活、学习或其他方面的问题，并且通过组织业余文化技术学习和文娱活动，对他们进行社会主义教育。
    但是，在过去很长的时间里，鞍钢建设公司金属结构安装工程公司的党组织，恰恰忘记了职工宿舍的工作。党组织的工作人员，整天忙于在办公室开会，忙于看表报和批发文件。他们同工人的接触，一般都是在大会和工地上，几年来很少有党员干部到过工人宿舍；而且即使同工人接触，也只是一般地谈谈工作，很少谈到工人的思想和生活问题。这就是说，党组织实际上只管工人工作的八小时，不管工人在宿舍中的十六小时。党组织要求工人好好地生产和工作，但是不关心职工的生活和学习。
    应当看到，放弃宿舍工作的结果，已经给党组织的工作带来了很大的损失，使党的组织一定程度地脱离了群众。在最近深入职工宿舍以后，鞍钢建设公司金属结构安装工程公司的党组织发现了由于许多有关职工生活、学习等方面的问题长期没有得到解决，或者根本就没有人过问，职工群众对党组织和行政上有不少意见。长甸铺基本建设职工宿舍内卫生条件不好，例如，炕席很久不换，上下水道坏了不修理。工人说，这些问题不知道反映过多少次，但是党组织和行政就不给解决。职工食堂的经营管理工作也不好，价钱贵的菜多，便宜菜太少，饭菜花样和种类也太少，买饭要等很长的时间。食堂的卫生也不成样子，筷子是一头黑一头白。这些意见，虽然工人不断地写在意见簿上，但是食堂管理人员很少加以改进，后来连意见簿也取消了。对这，党组织却没有过问。长甸铺的独身工人宿舍有四千多人，连同家属宿舍的职工在内共有九千多人，但是没有一个集中的娱乐场所。原有的两所俱乐部，在片面执行企业化方针的错误思想指导下，也都改成了收费的剧场和电影院。不少工人下班以后不是睡觉，就是赌钱，或者看“三剑侠”等神奇怪诞的小说。这很好地说明了由于党组织没有在职工宿舍中进行工作，不但职工的一些切身问题没有得到及时的和正确的解决，而且资产阶级的思想作风在职工群众中得到了蔓延滋长的机会。
    为了消除上述的不良现象，最近金属结构安装工程公司的党组织根据中共鞍山市委的指示，对宿舍工作作了一次检查。在检查中，公司党组织向职工作了自我批评，并且立即协同企业行政管理部门，改进了食堂和宿舍的管理工作，加强了对职工的业余文化技术学习和文娱活动的领导。党组织吸收职工群众代表成立了食堂管理委员会，迅速地改进了食堂工作。改进以后的食堂，工人可以吃到热饭热菜，三班施工的工人可以随到随吃；饭菜的花样增多了，由十一种小菜增加到二十多种。各宿舍的职工组织起来，选出了室代表和小组长，实行了轮流值班制度，改进了室内的清洁卫生工作。大多数宿舍还安上了扩音器，增加了报纸和娱乐设备。工人下班以后，可以自由参加文娱活动。目前，各有关单位正在进行有关组织职工学习文化技术的准备工作。
    上述有关职工生活和文化娱乐活动的改进虽然还只是开始，但是已经得到职工群众的热烈拥护。在改进了食堂工作以后，就有五百多职工写信表扬食堂。很多工人都表示，党组织这样关心他们，一定要努力生产和工作。职工群众的这些反映，对企业的党、政、工、团的领导同志是一个很好的教育，使这些领导同志进一步地认识到密切党组织同职工群众的联系，关心职工群众生活的重要性。
