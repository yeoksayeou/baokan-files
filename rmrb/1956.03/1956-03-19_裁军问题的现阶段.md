The Disarmament Subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission is scheduled to reconvene in London on March 19. People who care about peace have great expectations for this meeting, hoping that it can make a satisfactory contribution to promoting the realization of universal disarmament.

The characteristic of the current international situation is that, thanks to the efforts of the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries, a realistic prospect of consolidating peace has emerged. Under these circumstances, further agreements on disarmament can consolidate the achievements already made in easing international tensions and create favorable conditions for establishing lasting peace. Therefore, resolving the disarmament issue has become one of the most pressing concerns for people of all countries today.

What is the key to the disarmament issue at present? It is easy to see once one pierces through the smokescreen spread by Western countries: the key lies in whether the United States and its Western partners are willing to disarm, and whether they will continue to obstruct disarmament with useless empty talk as they have done in the past, or earnestly move forward on the path of disarmament.

The Soviet Union's position on disarmament is well known. The Soviet Union has consistently advocated arms reduction, the prohibition of nuclear weapons, and the implementation of strict and effective supervision of these measures. The Soviet Union's sincere efforts to promote agreements among relevant countries on disarmament are also visible to all. In particular, the Soviet Union's proposal of May 10, 1955, which absorbed the opinions of Western countries and put forward practical and feasible methods for all aspects of disarmament, opened the way for resolving the disarmament issue. However, the United States changed its original position, insisted on its so-called "aerial inspection" plan, and refused to discuss the most important issues of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. Later, Britain and France also withdrew their own original proposals and retreated to the position they held ten years ago. As a result, the Four-Power Summit Conference and the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference held in Geneva last year, which should have contributed to disarmament, did not make any progress on this most important issue.

Since the end of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, the voices of people of all countries demanding arms reduction and the prohibition of nuclear weapons have become louder than ever before. The United States and its partners' inaction on the disarmament issue has aroused great dissatisfaction among the people of all countries. The people of all countries can no longer tolerate the arms race policy that is making them increasingly impoverished and pushing them to the "brink of war." They have seen through the deceptive propaganda of Western countries that so-called maintaining and endlessly developing armaments and nuclear weapons can prevent war. They demand that, since the international situation has been eased to a certain extent, major powers should stop the harmful arms race and make greater efforts to promote the realization of universal disarmament. It is clear how strong the people's desire for universal disarmament is, simply by noting the fact that many influential figures in Western countries who were not active in this regard in the past have recently expressed their opposition to the arms race policy and condemned nuclear weapons. It is difficult for the ruling groups of Western countries to completely disregard this strong sentiment of the people.

Recently, the idea of peaceful coexistence has taken root so deeply in people's hearts and the policy of military blocs has been so despised, that not only are more and more countries in Asia, Africa, and Europe supporting the principle of peaceful coexistence and choosing the neutral path of not participating in military blocs, but also, in the public statements of some government leaders of NATO member states and in the opinions of some political figures and bourgeois newspapers in the United States, there have emerged opinions against overemphasizing military power as the basis of foreign policy and advocating acceptance of the situation of coexistence. This shows that the "policy of strength" is also becoming increasingly unsupported in the United States and its allies. On the other hand, the Soviet Union has continued to strive for the resolution of the disarmament issue after the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, and has repeatedly taken the initiative to seek a basis for approaching the United States in this regard. This unwavering effort of the Soviet Union has received increasingly broad support from the people of all countries. At the same time, the Soviet Union has also issued a stern warning to those who are still indulging in the idea of nuclear war, pointing out the serious consequences that a new war would bring. The rapid development of the Soviet Union in nuclear science and long-range projection technology has not only broken the United States' monopoly on atomic weapons, which it has always relied on as the main basis of its "position of strength" policy, but has also changed the so-called advantage of the United States in this regard. Now, not only the bourgeois newspapers of Western countries, but also many influential people admit that it is time to consider abandoning nuclear weapons.

The above-mentioned developments cannot but affect the attitudes adopted by the governments of some countries on the disarmament issue.

The new French government has recently expressed its willingness to take more active steps to promote disarmament and is prepared to propose a new disarmament plan. Maurice Faure, the French representative to the Disarmament Subcommittee, said that this plan integrates the existing views of the United States and the Soviet Union. Moreover, according to French Prime Minister Mollet, the French proposal has been approved by the United Kingdom, and the new plan will be jointly submitted to the Disarmament Subcommittee by the United Kingdom and France. As long as the purpose of this plan is truly to promote disarmament, it can be expected to receive attention.

It has also been noted that U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, in his March 1 reply to Chairman Bulganin, stated that he believed "it should now be possible to reach agreement on some stabilizing measures regarding the control and limitation of major types of armaments under adequate safeguard arrangements." If Eisenhower's remarks mean that the United States is willing to change its past stubborn position on the disarmament issue, that would be welcome. However, such peaceful promises remain to be proven by actual actions. The future work of the Disarmament Subcommittee will show whether Eisenhower's remarks are, as some American newspapers say, just a "propaganda measure."

It must be pointed out that the practice of the United States, Britain, France, and Canada holding unilateral meetings on the eve of the meeting of the Disarmament Subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission to discuss common strategies cannot be considered conducive to the work of the Subcommittee. Some Western news agencies even make no secret of the fact that the purpose of the unilateral meeting in London is to restrain the initiative of certain countries in disarmament work. According to reports, the United States raised "many objections" to the plan that Britain and France were preparing to propose during the meeting. This situation cannot but lead people to believe that there are still great difficulties in the work of the Disarmament Subcommittee. However, the people of all countries will not allow the disarmament work to continue to be delayed. Western countries, especially the United States, must take action to show the world whether they are willing to disarm. It is deeply believed that the increasingly strong will of the people of all countries to stop the arms race and consolidate peace will eventually have an impact on the cause of disarmament.

    裁军问题的现阶段
    谭文瑞
    联合国裁军委员会小组委员会已定于本月19日在伦敦复会。关心和平的人们对于这个会议怀着很大的期望，希望它能够对于促成普遍裁军的实现作出令人满意的贡献。
    当前国际形势的特点是，由于苏联和其他爱好和平的国家的努力，已出现了巩固和平的现实前景。在这种情况下，进一步就裁军问题达成协议，就可以巩固在缓和国际紧张局势方面已经取得的成就，为建立持久的和平创造有利的条件。因此，使裁军问题得到解决成为各国人民当前所最关心的一件事情。
    裁军问题目前的关键在哪里呢？人们只要拨开西方国家所散布的烟幕就很容易看得明白：关键在于美国和它的西方伙伴究竟愿不愿意裁军，在于它们是继续像过去那样用无益的空谈来阻挠裁军工作还是在裁军的道路上认真向前迈进。
    苏联在裁军问题上的立场是大家都知道的。苏联一贯主张裁减军备，主张禁止核子武器，主张对这些措施实行严格而有效的监督。苏联为了促成有关各国在裁军问题上取得协议而进行的真诚努力，也是大家都看得见的。特别是苏联1955年5月10日的建议，汲取了西方国家的意见，对裁军的各个方面都提出了切实可行的办法，曾为解决裁军问题打开了道路。但是美国改变了它原来的立场，坚持它的所谓“空中视察”计划，而拒绝讨论裁军和禁止原子武器这些最重要的问题，后来英法两国也收回了它们自己原先提出的建议，而退回到10年以前的立场上去。这样，就使得去年在日内瓦举行的本应当对裁军作出贡献的四国首脑会议和四外长会议，没有在这个最重要的问题上取得任何进展。
    四国外长会议结束以来，各国人民要求裁减军备和禁止核子武器的呼声比过去更加高涨。美国和它的伙伴在裁军问题上的怠工引起了各国人民的极大不满。各国人民不能继续容忍使他们日益贫困和把他们推上“战争边缘”的军备竞赛政策。他们看穿了西方国家的那种所谓保持和无止境地发展军备和核子武器可以防止战争的欺骗宣传。他们要求，既然国际局势已经有了一定程度的缓和，各大国之间就更应该停止有害的军备竞赛，作更大的努力来促成普遍裁军的实现。只要注意到西方国家中许多过去在这方面并不积极的有影响的人物近来也纷纷表示反对军备竞赛政策和谴责核子武器的事实，就可以知道各国人民要求普遍裁军的情绪是如何的强烈。西方国家的统治集团要想把人民的这种强烈的情绪完全置之不顾是很难的。
    最近以来，和平共处的思想已如此深入人心，军事集团的政策已如此受到唾弃，不只是在亚洲、非洲和欧洲有愈来愈多的国家支持和平共处的原则，选择不参加军事集团的中立道路，就是在一些北大西洋集团成员国的政府领袖的公开言论和美国的一些政界人士和资产阶级报纸舆论中间，也出现了反对过分强调以军事力量为外交政策的基础的意见，而主张接受共处的局面。这表明了“实力政策”在美国国内和它的同盟国中间也愈来愈得不到支持。另一方面，苏联在四国外长会议后仍然继续为促成裁军问题的解决而努力，并一再主动向美国寻求在这方面接近的基础。苏联的这一坚持不渝的努力得到各国人民愈来愈广泛的支持。同时，苏联也向那些迄今还沉缅于核子战争的想法的人们发出了严正的警告，指出发动一场新的战争将要带来的严重后果。苏联在核子科学和远距离投射技术方面的迅速发展，不仅打破了美国一向作为“实力地位”政策的主要依恃的原子武器垄断，而且改变了美国在这方面的所谓优势。现在，不仅是西方国家的资产阶级报刊，而且许多有势力的人士都承认应该是考虑放弃核子武器的时候了。
    上述的这些事态的发展，不能不影响到一些国家的政府在裁军问题上所采取的态度。
    法国的新政府最近已表示愿意采取比较积极的步骤来推动裁军的工作，并且准备提出一个新的裁军计划。法国出席裁军小组委员会的代表莫克说，这个计划是综合了美国和苏联现有的观点的。而且据法国总理摩勒宣布，法国的主张已得到了英国的赞同，新的计划将由英法两国联合向裁军小组委员会提出。只要这个计划的目的真正是为了促成裁军，它是可以指望受到人们的重视的。
    人们同时也注意到，美国总统艾森豪威尔在3月1日给布尔加宁主席的复信中表示，他认为“现在就关于在适当的保障办法下管制和限制主要类型的军备的、会有一种稳定作用的一些措施达成协议，应该是可能的。”艾森豪威尔的这番话如果是意味着美国愿意改变它过去在裁军问题上的固执的立场，那是会受到欢迎的。不过这种和平的诺言还有待实际行动来证明。裁军小组委员会未来的工作将会表明，艾森豪威尔的表示是否像一些美国报纸所说的，只是一种“宣传措施”。
    必须指出，美、英、法、加四国在联合国裁军委员会小组委员会开会的前夕举行了片面的会议来商拟共同策略的做法，是不能被认为有利于小组委员会的工作的。有些西方通讯社甚至毫不掩饰，伦敦片面会议的目的就是为了抑制某些国家对裁军工作的主动精神。据消息透露，美国在会议中曾对英法准备提出的方案提出了“许多反对的意见”。这种情形使人不能不认为在裁军小组委员会的工作中还存在着很大的困难。但是，各国人民不容许裁军工作继续拖延下去了。西方国家首先是美国必须用行动来向全世界表明究竟是否愿意裁军。人们深信，各国人民要求停止军备竞赛和巩固和平的日益增强的意志是终于要对裁军的事业发生影响的。
