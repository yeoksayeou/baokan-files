    In a Nursery
    Chen Yongjin

    At the end of a road, there is a newly built set of houses in the national style. This is a famous nursery here.

    As soon as we entered the nursery, the female director, in her 40s, proudly introduced to us:

    "Comrades! Take a look at our facilities! The children of this generation are truly extremely happy." The female director pointed to a large pile of exquisite toys and said, "These are all custom-made from Shanghai, and some are bought from the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries. Look, this electric airplane can't be made in our city! You say these kids are really strange, they get tired of toys bought for so much money after playing with them for a while, but they are so interested in mud and water." After looking at the toys, the director led us to visit the children's living quarters: "Take a look at our steel wire beds. I made a special trip to Shanghai to order these steel wire beds."

    "How much is one?" I asked.

    "Not worth much, only a little over a hundred yuan." The director, probably afraid that we hadn't noticed the beautiful red carpet under the small steel wire bed, deliberately reminded us: "With the carpet, it doesn't matter if the children fall out of bed. I personally bought this carpet in Tianjin. Look! There are carpets in the children's dormitories and activity rooms. You know, these children are especially naughty, always hitting each other. With carpets, it doesn't matter if they wrestle on the ground."

    Next, the director proudly introduced the process of building the nursery to us: "It's not easy to get these facilities. You know, I ran to the Finance Committee so many times for funding! Those comrades in charge of finance are really tight-fisted. I said to the director of the Finance Committee here, aren't we making revolution and sacrificing blood for the sake of future generations! There are still two of your children in the nursery! I made a budget of 100,000 yuan. After much persuasion, I finally got the director to nod. The director said, 100,000 it is! But you have to guarantee that the children won't lose weight."

    After a pause, she added, "Alas, it's not easy to run a nursery!" I don't know if she meant setting up those facilities or educating the children.

    Something happened in another courtyard that called the director away. I saw a few children beside the rockery discussing enthusiastically, and I walked over. A larger child sitting at the highest point of the rockery asked a child next to him:

    "Baozi, Baozi, what will you do when you grow up?"

    "I'll drive a train. I'll drive a train pulling a lot of people, going very far, very far away."

    "Hmph, I won't drive a train! Train drivers are so dirty!"

    "You drive a car, Nannan!" Baozi continued.

    "I won't drive a car either! My family has a limousine. I tell the driver where to go, and he goes there!"

    "Then what will you do, Nannan?"

    "Be a minister like my dad, with a limousine so you don't have to walk. Whoever he tells to do something has to do it."

    "What's so great about being a minister." A little guy who spoke even more fiercely than Nannan said: "I don't want to be a minister! My family also has a limousine, newer than your dad's. My dad is a commander, and he even controls the minister!"

    "Commander, what's so great. My dad is a political commissar, and the commander has to listen to him," said a very proud Sheng Sheng.

    "What's so great about a minister, commander, or political commissar, your dads all have to read articles written by my dad. My dad is a writer," said another.

    "What does a writer count for!"

    "What does a political commissar count for!"

    The two children started fighting as they spoke, and Sheng Sheng beat another child to tears. The director rushed over and criticized Sheng Sheng:

    "Sheng Sheng, why are you hitting your little brother again?"

    "It's none of your business, what are you, a director! You still take orders from my dad! If my dad tells you to get lost, you have to get lost." Sheng Sheng cursed a few times and ran away.

    "Oh dear! The state has spent so much money to set up a nursery, but it's raising some little masters like this, really..." The director showed a helpless expression and smiled bitterly at us.

    The telephone in the director's office rang again, and a young aunt ran over and shouted:

    "Director, someone wants to talk to you!"

    "Who's looking for me, just say I'm busy in a meeting!"

    "No, he insists on talking to you."

    The director walked to the office with measured steps, picked up the telephone receiver unhappily:

    "Okay, okay, you talk! You want to send a child, yes, we still have a few spots here, but what level of cadre are you, ... that won't do..." The director slammed the receiver down.

    At this moment, the clear sound of a car horn came from outside the gate. Soon a plump female cadre in her 30s came in. The director greeted her, and the two shook hands warmly, looking like they were very familiar.

    "How did you find time to come? Comrade Wang!" said the director.

    "His dad misses Sheng Sheng again. I came out to buy some groceries and take Sheng Sheng back by the way."

    The director hesitated for a while, as if wanting to insist on their nursery's rules: children can't be picked up until Saturday. But she didn't insist, and repeatedly agreed "Okay, okay!" This mother hugged Sheng Sheng as soon as she saw him, kissing him again and again, looking at him again and again, saying: My good baby, my good darling, your dad has bought a lot of delicious things again. Then she began to examine Sheng Sheng from head to toe, and found a scratch on Sheng Sheng's leg. This lady, with a face full of anger, glanced sideways at the nursery's aunts and said:

    "What's going on, this is really a mess."

    "Sheng Sheng likes to fight," a young aunt walked over and said.

    "Fighting, fighting, what do I need you for!"

    "Who can control your children, whoever tries to control them gets scolded."

    "Nonsense, really not open to suggestion..." The lady led Sheng Sheng into the limousine, slammed the car door shut, the car horn sounded, and the car drove away.

    Many children who missed their mothers and fathers stared blankly at the shadow of that beautiful limousine, some were making a fuss with the aunts about going home, and some were crying. Several aunts muttered: The political commissar's child, can do whatever he wants, this nursery is really impossible to run, really....

    After watching these scenes in this nursery, I can't help but worry about the future of these children. I can't help but think of Gorky's words: "Loving children is something even hens can do. But being good at educating them is a great national undertaking..."

### 在一个托儿所里

    在一个托儿所里
    陈勇进
    在一条马路的尽头，有一片新建的民族形式的房子，这是这儿的一所有名的托儿所。
    我们一进托儿所，40多岁的女所长就得意地向我们介绍说：
    “同志！看看我们的设备吧！这一代的儿童真是幸福极了。”女所长指着一大堆精巧的玩具说：“这都是从上海订做的，有些还是从苏联和人民民主国家买来的。瞧，这架电动飞机咱们这个城里就做不出来！你说这些娃娃们真怪，花这样多钱买的玩具，他们玩一会就腻了，他们对泥、水却感到那么大的兴趣。”看完玩具，所长又领我们去参观孩子们的住处：“你看看我们这钢丝床，为了订做这钢丝床，我专门到上海去了一趟。”
    “多少钱一张？”我问。
    “值不了几个钱，才百多元。”所长大概怕我们没注意到铺在小钢丝床下的漂亮的红地毯，故意提醒我们说：“有了地毯孩子们从床上摔下来也不要紧。这地毯是我亲自到天津买的。你们看吧！孩子的宿舍和活动室里都有地毯。你们知道，这些孩子可特别调皮，整天你打我我打你的，有了地毯，他们就是在地上摔跤也不要紧。”
    接着，所长又夸耀地向我们介绍建设这个托儿所的经过：“置办这些设备可不容易呀。你知道，为了经费我到财委跑了多少次呀！那些管财政的同志可真扣的紧。我对这里财委主任说，咱们闹革命，流血牺牲，还不是为了后代吗！托儿所里可还有你的两个孩子哩！我作了十万元的预算。好说歹说，最后总算把主任说点头了。主任说，10万就10万吧！可是你得保证不要叫孩子瘦了。”
    停了一会，她又加上一句：“唉，办个托儿所，就是不容易呀！”我不知道她是说置办那些设备，还是说教育孩子。
    在另一个院子里不知发生了什么事，把所长叫出去了。我看见假山旁边有几个娃娃在热烈地议论着，我走了过去。坐在假山最高处的一个较大的孩子问他旁边的一个小孩：
    “保子，保子，你大了干什么？”
    “我开火车，我开着火车拉很多的人，走得很远很远的。”
    “哼，我才不开火车哩！火车司机多脏呀！”
    “你开小汽车吧，南南！”保子接着说。
    “我才不开汽车哩！我家就有小卧车，我说叫司机开到哪里，就开到哪里！”
    “那你干什么呢，南南？”
    “像我爸爸一样当部长，有小卧车不用走路，他叫谁干什么谁就干什么。”
    “部长有什么了不起。”一个比南南说话更凶的小家伙说：“我才不当部长哩！我家也有小卧车，比你爸爸的车还新哪。我爸爸是司令员，他还管部长哩！”
    “司令员，有什么了不起。我爸爸是政委，司令员还要听他说哩。”一个叫生生的神气十足地说。
    “部长、司令员、政委又有什么了不得，你们的爸爸都要读我爸爸写的文章，我爸爸是作家。”另一个说。
    “作家算什么！”
    “政委算什么！”
    两个孩子说着说着就打起来了，生生把另一个娃娃打哭了。所长匆忙地跑过来批评生生说：
    “生生，你怎么又打小弟弟呀？”
    “你管不着，你所长算个什么东西，你还受我爸爸指挥哩！我爸爸叫你滚蛋你就得滚蛋。”生生骂了几句跑掉了。
    “哎呀呀！国家花了这么多钱，办了托儿所，可是培养出这样一些小少爷，真是……”所长显出一脸无可奈何的神情向我们苦笑着。
    所长办公室里的电话铃又响起来了，一位年轻的阿姨跑来喊：
    “所长，有人请你讲话！”
    “什么人找我讲话，就说我忙着开会哩！”
    “不，他一定要你讲话。”
    所长迈着四方步走到办公室，不高兴地拿起电话耳机：
    “好好，你讲吧！要送娃娃吗，对，我们这里还有几个位置，可是你是哪级干部，……那不行……”所长砰地一下把耳机放下了。
    此刻大门外面传来了清脆的汽车的喇叭声。不一会进来一个30多岁的胖胖的女干部。所长迎了上去，两人热情地握手，看来大概很熟。
    “你怎么有空来啦？王同志！”所长说。
    “他爸爸又想生生了，我出来买点菜，顺便把生生接回去。”
    所长迟疑了一会儿，像是要坚持他们托儿所的规定：不到星期六不能接孩子。可是她没有坚持，却连声答应“好吧，好吧！”这位妈妈，一见生生就抱在怀里亲了又亲，看了又看，一边说：我的好宝宝，我的好乖乖，你爸爸又给买来很多好吃的东西啦。接着她就从头到脚地在生生的身上检查起来了，结果发现了生生的腿上有一个地方擦破了一点皮。这位太太满脸怒气地用眼角斜扫着托儿所的阿姨们说：
    “这是怎么搞的，真是乱弹琴。”
    “生生好打架。”一个年轻的阿姨走近来说。
    “打架打架，要你们干什么！”
    “你们的孩子谁管得了，谁管骂谁。”
    “胡说八道，真是不虚心……”那位太太领着生生上了小卧车，把车门用力一关，车子的喇叭响了一声就开走了。
    不少想妈妈，想爸爸的娃娃呆呆地望着那辆漂亮的小卧车的影子，有的向阿姨闹着要回家，有的张嘴哭起来了。几个阿姨嘟囔说：政委的孩子，愿意怎样就怎样，这托儿所真没法办了，真是……。
    在这个托儿所里，看了这样几个场面之后，我不禁为这些孩子的将来担心。我不由得想起高尔基的话：“爱儿女，这是连母鸡也会的。但是善于教育他们，却是一个伟大的国家的事业……。”
