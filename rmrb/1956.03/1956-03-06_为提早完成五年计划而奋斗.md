    Striving to Complete the Five-Year Plan Ahead of Schedule
    Gutian Hydropower Station Begins Power Transmission
    The first stage of the first phase of the Gutian Hydropower Station in Fujian has been completed and officially generated electricity on the 1st, transmitting power to Fuzhou via high-voltage lines. The Gutian Hydropower Station is another large hydropower station designed by Chinese engineers and technicians and equipped with Chinese-made equipment, following the Guanting Hydropower Station.
    The powerhouse of this hydropower station is built underground. The entire project is divided into three stages, with the first stage generating 60,000 kilowatts. On the 1st, 12,000 kilowatts of electricity were transmitted from here. In the future, the industrial and lighting electricity for Fuzhou City, as well as the Lianbinggang electric irrigation area in Changle County east of Fuzhou, will receive inexpensive power supply.
    Song Wanqing Creates New High-Speed Cutting Record
    Song Wanqing, a young lathe operator at the Shanghai Turbine Factory, set a new record of 1,357 meters per minute on the afternoon of the 5th, breaking the record of 1,287 meters set by Sheng Li, a well-known high-speed cutting expert, three days earlier.
    Song Wanqing's new record was set at a metal cutting performance held at the Shanghai Turbine Factory on the 5th. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League awarded Song Wanqing the title of "Youth Production Pace-setter" at this performance.
    Using Bamboo Pipes Instead of Iron Pipes for Water Supply
    Wang Fengwu, a worker at the Changchun Municipal Civil Engineering Company and a municipal model worker, has successfully experimented with using bamboo pipes instead of iron pipes for temporary water supply pipelines. The cost of each meter of bamboo pipe is approximately 11% of the cost of each meter of iron pipe.
    After testing, Wang Fengwu found that bamboo pipes with a diameter of 3 to 4 inches do not leak under a pressure of 3 to 5 kilograms, while the water pressure of general temporary projects is only about 2 kilograms. The company has decided to completely use bamboo pipes instead of iron pipes for the water supply pipelines of all temporary projects under construction this year. In this way, for every 500 meters of bamboo pipe used, the country can save more than 3,100 yuan compared to using iron pipes.

    Tianjin Youth Workers
    Strive to Complete One and a Half Days' Work in One Day
    A movement initiated by young workers to break the "one-and-a-half quota" has emerged in Tianjin. The content is: under the premise of ensuring quality, reducing costs, safe production, and balanced production, using methods such as finding tricks, realizing rationalization proposals, and promoting advanced experience, to complete one and a half days' work in one day's production time (8 hours).
    Lu Deming and Fan Yixian, workers at the state-owned Tianjin Power Machine Factory and Tianjin model workers, along with 23 other advanced producers from the factory, first proposed the initiative. On the same day—February 17—it was responded to by more than 600 young workers in the factory. In the past 16 days, more than 9% of the factory's young workers have reached and exceeded the "one-and-a-half quota." Due to the promotion of advanced experience such as high-speed cutting, high-speed drilling, and multi-tooling, the number of young workers in the two machine departments who broke the "one-and-a-half quota" reached 16.5%. Young workers in factories such as the Tianjin Fifth Machine Factory have also launched similar movements. Within a week of launching the movement, more than 24% of the young machinists at the Fifth Machine Factory had broken the "one-and-a-half quota."

    Many Industrial Enterprises in Chongqing Exchange Advanced Experience
    Many industrial enterprises in Chongqing have recently widely organized activities to exchange advanced experience. In February, the nine coal mines under the Chongqing Coal Mine Administration held an advanced experience exchange meeting. At the meeting, mines such as Hua'an, Nantong, Tianfu, and the Zhongliangshan Coalfield construction unit introduced the advanced experiences of their respective units. Due to its good safety work, the Hua'an Coal Mine has not had any serious injury or death accidents in the past three years. After conscientiously implementing the multi-cycle operation method, the employees constructing the Zhongliangshan flat tunnel continuously created new records in flat tunnel excavation. After the Tianfu Coal Mine promoted the "one-shift coal mining system," the coal mining efficiency of the small single-seam coal layer was increased by one and a half times. The Chongqing Coal Mine Administration has printed these experiences into booklets and distributed them to the employees of each mine for study.
    In February, Chongqing's construction enterprises organized two advanced operation performances. Advanced producers Yang Changshi, Yang Changbin, and others demonstrated operation methods such as the "single-person mortar spreader" and "movable line opening method" to the employee representatives of construction units throughout the city.
    The widespread exchange of advanced experience has improved the production efficiency of many workers. On some construction sites of the Chongqing Third Construction Engineering Company, the bricklaying efficiency of workers averaged 43% to 60% higher than the national unified quota. After the Tianfu Coal Mine held an experience exchange meeting on mining, more than 100 workers created new mining records in less than a month.

    Early Spring Plowing Begins in Early Warm Areas of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
    Spring plowing has started earlier than in previous years in the early warm areas of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region—the Turpan Basin and the Hotan Prefecture on the northern foothills of the Kunlun Mountains. The sowing time for spring wheat in Turpan County was half a month earlier than in previous years. More than 400,000 mu of spring wheat in Hotan Prefecture will also be basically sown in early March. In the vast fields where many field boundaries have been leveled, teams of agricultural production cooperatives are carrying out winter wheat spring harrowing and strip sowing of spring wheat. Carts and donkeys are constantly transporting manure to the fields.
    The southern regions of the autonomous region have thawed, and Uygur farmers have begun spring harrowing of winter wheat. In Kucha, Xinhe, Shufu and other counties where spring harrowing is being carried out the earliest, agricultural production cooperatives have also generally carried out topdressing and sand spreading on the winter wheat fields before spring harrowing.
    In the regions of the autonomous region with later seasons, the snow has begun to melt, and spring plowing will generally begin after mid-March.

    Female Lathe Operator Zhang Shufen of Automobile Factory
    Produced More Than 10,000 Tools Without Any Defective Products
    Zhang Shufen, a young female lathe operator at the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, has produced more than 10,000 tools without producing a single defective product. This advanced producer, who was rated as having excellent quality, was still a young student at the workers' technical school in 1954. Since February last year, she has become a machine tool operator. Since then, she has never produced a defective product or had a machine tool accident.
    The measuring tool department where she works produces many types of measuring tools with high precision, and the technical conditions are difficult to control. Before receiving each batch of work, Zhang Shufen always carefully reads the drawings two or three times to ensure that she is thoroughly familiar with the drawings and clearly understands the technical conditions. When she doesn't understand something, she immediately consults the teacher or technical personnel. She regularly checks and cleans the machines. Before starting the machine each time, she first turns the machine by hand to test whether there are iron filings or other debris flying in, and then turns on the power to formally operate after the transmission parts of the machine tool are normal.

    Women in Jiangsu Actively Participate in Agricultural Production
    An unprecedented upsurge of women participating in agricultural production has emerged in rural Jiangsu Province. Hundreds of thousands of female members have become the backbone of agricultural production cooperatives.
    In many areas, almost all of the female labor force is active in the fields. In some areas where women did not have the habit of working in the past, 70% to 80% of the women have participated in agricultural production after collectivization. In Tianmei Township, Jianhu County, only 32% of women participated in production in the past, but now it has increased to 89%. Nearly 140,000 women in 84 townships in counties such as Lianshui, Shuyang, Huaian, Sihong, and Suqian have launched a fertilizer accumulation campaign to strive for high yields. They have already accumulated more than 1 million loads of natural fertilizer and dug more than 500,000 loads of silt. On the cotton fields in Sanyu District of Nantong, on the mud dredging boats in Xiaocheli River in Yancheng County, and on the Xingbin side of Binhai County, assault teams composed of female members are currently busy carrying out fertilizer accumulation and field management work.

    为提早完成五年计划而奋斗
    古田水电站开始送电
    福建古田水电站第一级第一期建设工程已经完工，1日正式发电，并且通过高压电线向福州送电。古田水电站是继官厅水电站发电后的又一座由中国工程技术人员设计、并用中国制造的设备装备起来的大水电站。
    这座水电站的厂房建筑在地下。全部工程分为三级，第一级工程的发电量是6万瓩。1日从这里发出的电力是12，000瓩。今后福州市的工业和照明用电，以及福州以东长乐县莲柄港电力灌溉区等，都将获得廉价的电力供应。 （据新华社讯）
    宋万庆创造高速切削新纪录
    上海汽轮机厂青年车工宋万庆在5日下午又以每分钟切削1，357公尺的新纪录，打破了3天前著名的高速切削能手盛利所创造的1，287公尺的纪录。
    宋万庆的新纪录是5日在上海汽轮机厂举行的金属切削表演会上创造的。青年团上海市委员会在这个表演会上特授予宋万庆以“青年生产突击手”的称号。 （据新华社讯）
    用竹筒代替铁管作上水管道
    长春市土木工程公司工人、市劳动模范王凤武，试验用竹筒子代替铁管子作暂设工程的上水管道已经成功。每公尺竹筒子约等于每公尺铁管子成本的11％。
    王凤武经过试验，3寸到4寸口径的竹筒子在加压3公斤到5公斤的情况下不漏水，一般暂设工程水压才2公斤左右。这个公司决定今年施工的全部暂设工程的上水管道，完全采用竹筒子代替铁管子。这样作，每用500公尺竹筒子，就可以比用铁管子给国家节约3，100多元。（新华社）
    天津市青年工人
    争取一天完成一天半的工作量
    天津市出现了青年工人发起的突破“倍半定额”的运动。内容是：在保证质量、降低成本、安全生产和均衡生产的前提下，用找窍门、实现合理化建议和推广先进经验的方法，在一天的生产时间（8小时）内完成一天半的工作量。
    国营天津动力机厂工人、天津市劳动模范陆德明、范以贤两人和这个厂的另外23个先进生产者首先提出倡议。当天——2月17日，就得到了本厂600多个青年工人的响应。在过去的16天中，全厂已经有9％以上的青年工人达到和突破了“倍半定额”。两个机工部由于推广了高速切削、高速钻孔和多绷活等先进经验，突破“倍半定额”的青年工人达到了16.5％。天津市第五机器厂等工厂青年工人也开展了同样的运动。第五机器厂在开展运动以后的一周以内，已经有24％以上的青年机工突破了“倍半定额”。 （据新华社讯）
    重庆许多工业企业交流先进经验
    重庆市许多工业企业最近广泛组织了交流先进经验的活动。2月份，重庆煤矿管理局所属的9个煤矿举行了先进经验交流会。会上，华安、南桐、天府等矿和中梁山煤田建设单位，都介绍了本单位的先进经验。华安煤矿由于安全工作做得好，3年来没有发生重伤和死亡事故。建设中梁山平洞的职工，认真推行多循环作业方法以后，连续创造了开拓平洞的新纪录。天府煤矿推广了“一班采煤制”以后，使小独连煤层的采煤效率提高了一倍半。重庆煤矿管理局已经把这些经验印成小册子，分发给各矿职工学习。
    重庆市建筑企业2月里组织了两次先进操作表演。先进生产者杨长诗、杨长斌等，向全市建筑单位的职工代表表演了“单人铺灰器”、“活动开线法”等操作方法。
    先进经验的广泛交流，使得许多工人的生产效率提高了。重庆第三建筑工程公司有些工地上的工人，砌砖的效率平均超过全国统一定额43％到60％。天府煤矿举行采掘经验交流会后，不到一个月就有100多个工人创造了采掘新纪录。 （据新华社讯）
    新疆维吾尔自治区早暖地区提早开始春耕
    新疆维吾尔自治区早暖地区——吐鲁番盆地和昆仑山北麓的和阗专区，春耕比往年开始得早。吐鲁番县播种春麦的时间比往年提早了半个月。和阗专区的40多万亩春麦也将在3月上旬基本播完。在平整了很多田界地埂的大片田野里，一队队农业生产合作社的春耕队正在进行冬麦春耙和条播春小麦。大车、毛驴来往不停地往田里运送粪肥。
    自治区南部地区已经解冻，维吾尔族农民开始春耙冬麦。春耙进行得最早的库车、新和、疏附等县的农业生产合作社，在春耙前还普遍地在冬麦地里进行了追肥和铺沙土的工作。
    自治区季节较晚的地区，积雪开始消融，3月中旬以后也将普遍开始春耕。 （据新华社讯）
    汽车厂女车工张淑芬
    生产一万多件工具没出废品
    第一汽车制造厂青年女车工张淑芬，生产一万多件工具没有出过一件废品。这个被评为优等质量的先进生产者，在1954年还是工人技术学校的青年学生。从去年2月开始，她成为机床操作工人。从那时起就一直没有出过一件废品，没有发生过一次机床事故。
    她所在的量具工部生产的量具种类多，精密度高，技术条件很难控制。张淑芬在接到每批活之前，总是细心地把图纸看上两三遍，做到认真熟悉图纸，明确技术条件。当她弄不清楚的时候，就立刻请教老师或技术人员。她经常检查和擦洗机器。每次开动机器前，都先用手把机器转一下，试验是否有铁屑或其他杂物飞进去，待机床各个传动部分正常以后，再开电门进行正式运转。 （据新华社讯）
    江苏妇女积极参加农业生产
    江苏省农村中出现从来没有过的妇女参加农业生产的热潮。数以10万计的女社员作了农业生产合作社的骨干。
    许多地区差不多全部妇女劳动力都活跃在田野上。一些过去妇女没有劳动习惯的地区，在合作化以后也有70％到80％的妇女参加农业生产。建湖县天美乡过去只有32％的妇女参加生产，现在已经增加到89％。涟水、沭阳、淮安、泗洪、宿迁等县的84个乡将近14万妇女，开展了争取高额丰产的积肥活动，她们已经积好了100多万挑自然肥料，还挖了50多万挑淤泥。在南通三余区的棉田上，在盐城县小河里的罱泥船上，在滨海县的型滨边，一支一支由女社员组成的突击队目前正在紧张地进行积肥工作和田间管理工作。 （据新华社讯）
