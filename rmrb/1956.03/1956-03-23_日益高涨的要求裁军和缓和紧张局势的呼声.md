    Mounting Calls for Disarmament and Easing of Tensions

    Vietnamese People Concerned About Disarmament
    The Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace recently held an enlarged meeting and sent a telegram to the World Peace Council, expressing its support for the upcoming special meeting of the World Peace Council on the issue of arms reduction and the prohibition of atomic weapons.
    The telegram pointed out: "This is a matter of utmost concern to the whole world and to Vietnam, because the South Vietnamese authorities are increasing armaments and transporting new troops, military personnel, weapons and ammunition into South Vietnam in preparation for the resumption of war."
    The telegram said: In order to consolidate peace in Southeast Asia and the world, we pledge to actively fight for the resolution of the above-mentioned important issues and for the full respect of the Geneva Accords on Indochina.

    Views of the French Peace Council
    Madame Farge wrote a letter to Mr. Moch, the French representative to the United Nations Disarmament Committee, expressing the views of the French National Peace Council to Moch on the disarmament issue.
    Madame Farge supported Moch's argument of "neither supervision without disarmament, nor disarmament without supervision." The letter stated: "For any country, the importance of the disarmament issue surpasses all other issues, because even a limited agreement in this regard will help resolve other contentious issues. This is especially true for the German question, which is of direct interest to our country."
    Madame Farge finally notified Moch that the French National Peace Council is determined to strive for the prohibition of thermonuclear weapons, and the Council will support any initiative by the French representative to sign and implement an international disarmament agreement in 1956.

    Call from Canadian Peace Advocates
    Canadian peace advocates recently held a meeting in Toronto under the auspices of the Canadian Peace Congress. The meeting discussed the issue of disarmament and called on all peace advocates to urge the reaching of an international agreement on the cessation of thermonuclear weapon tests and the implementation of gradual disarmament with effective supervision.
    On March 19, a delegation of participants in the meeting went to Ottawa to meet with sixty members of parliament. The delegates asked the parliamentarians to support proposals for concluding an international agreement prohibiting thermonuclear weapon tests, and to ensure that the activities of the Canadian representatives attending the London Disarmament Conference follow the approach of resolving disarmament issues through consultation. The vast majority of parliamentarians who received the delegates expressed their support for the cause of disarmament.

    Pijade Believes Disarmament Is Possible
    When asked about the possibility of reducing armaments and banning the use of atomic weapons, Pijade, the President of the Federal National Assembly of Yugoslavia, said: I believe that it is practically feasible and possible for the major powers to reach an agreement on the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of the use of weapons of mass destruction. This is even indispensable.
    Pijade believes that the responsibility for avoiding an atomic war lies primarily with the countries that possess nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. He said: Before an agreement is reached, a partial agreement on the issue of testing thermonuclear weapons is possible and entirely appropriate. A disarmament agreement will not only greatly promote the peaceful resolution of other international issues, including collective security issues, but will also guarantee their satisfactory resolution. Pijade concluded that there is no other way to solve these problems.

    Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson on Disarmament
    Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson said in the House of Commons on March 20, in response to a question, that "Canada, together with other Western countries, will do its best to expand the scope of agreements that may already exist between East and West, in order to seek at least some degree of effective disarmament, which will help to ease international tensions and thus promote the resolution of other outstanding issues." Pearson also said that "a 'disarmament plan' that does not include effective supervision and monitoring methods will not help achieve the desired goals."

    日益高涨的要求裁军和缓和紧张局势的呼声
    越南人民关心裁军问题
    越南保卫世界和平委员会最近举行的扩大会议拍电报给世界和平理事会，表示拥护世界和平理事会即将就裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题举行的特别会议。
    电报指出：“这是全世界和越南所最关心的问题，因为南越当局正在增加军备，把新的军队、军事人员、武器和弹药运入南越以准备重新发动战争。”
    电报说：为了巩固东南亚和世界的和平，我们保证为解决上述重要问题和为完全尊重关于印度支那问题的日内瓦协定而积极进行斗争。
    法国和平理事会的意见
    法奇夫人写信给法国驻联合国裁军委员会代表莫克，她代表法国全国和平理事会向莫克表示对裁军问题的主张。
    法奇夫人支持莫克提出的“既不是没有裁军的监督，也不是没有监督的裁军”的论点。信中写道：“无论对哪个国家说来，裁军问题的重要性超过其他一切问题，因为即使在这一方面达成有限的协议，也会有助于其他争执问题的解决。就对我国有直接利害关系的德国问题说来，这一点是特别正确。”
    法奇夫人最后通知莫克说，法国全国和平理事会坚决地要争取达到禁止热核子武器，理事会将支持法国代表提出的主张在1956年签订和实现国际裁军协议的任何倡议。
    加拿大和平拥护者的呼声
    加拿大和平拥护者最近在加拿大和平委员会的主持下在多伦多举行了一次会议。会议讨论了裁军问题，并且号召一切和平拥护者敦促就停止热核子武器试验以及进行逐步裁军并且对其实行有效监督的问题达成国际协议。
    三月十九日，参加会议的人组成的一个代表团到渥太华来会晤六十个议员。代表们要求议员支持缔结禁止热核子武器试验的国际协定的建议，要求出席伦敦裁军会议的加拿大代表的活动遵循协商解决裁军问题的方针。接见代表的绝大多数议员都表示他们支持裁军的主张。
    皮雅杰认为裁军是可能的
    南斯拉夫联邦国民议会主席皮雅杰在回答关于裁减军备和禁止使用原子武器的可能性的问题时说：我认为，在大国之间就裁军问题和禁止使用大规模毁灭性武器问题达成协议是切实可行的，而且是可能的。这甚至是不可缺少的。
    皮雅杰认为，避免原子战争的责任，首先在于拥有核子和其他大规模毁灭性武器的国家。他说：在达成协议以前，就试验热核子武器问题达成部分协议是可能的，而且完全是合适的。裁军协议不仅会大大促进其他国际问题，包括集体安全问题的和平解决，而且同时会是它们获得圆满解决的保证。皮雅杰最后说，解决这些问题的其他办法是没有的。
    加外长皮尔逊谈裁军问题
    加拿大外交部长皮尔逊三月二十日在众议院中答复问题的时候说，“加拿大将同其他西方国家一道尽力扩大可能已经在东西方之间存在的协议的范围，以便求得至少是某种程度的有效的裁军，这将会有助于缓和国际紧张局势，从而促进其他悬而未决的问题的解决。”皮尔逊又说，“不包括有效的监督和监察方法的‘裁军计划’不会有助于达到所希望的目的”。
