    Do a Good Job in All Aspects of Spring Farming Preparation
    By our reporter Ji Xichen
    Since the establishment of cooperatives in Pixian County, Sichuan Province, last winter, the county has focused on developing production to consolidate the new cooperatives and has comprehensively carried out spring farming preparations. Now, the entire county's tobacco, hemp, and spring potatoes have been sown ahead of schedule, and the more than 200,000 mu of wheat and rapeseed have also been universally top-dressed with three or four applications of fertilizer. The seeds, fertilizers, and farm tools needed for the major spring production were basically prepared two months before the start of spring farming.
    After the realization of agricultural cooperation, the Pixian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party first grasped the central link of formulating advanced and reliable production increase plans as a driving force for carrying out the agricultural production increase movement. In order to break down conservative thinking on agricultural production increases, the county committee, in addition to educating cadres on the favorable conditions for production increases brought about by cooperation and deeply summarizing local experiences of increasing production to more than 1,000 jin per mu, also adopted the method of going deep into the masses and into the fields to formulate and revise production plans. From the county committee to the branch, they all went deep into a township, a cooperative, and a production team, relying on the broad masses of activists, going deep into the fields, conducting production surveys and land cultivation appraisals field by field; then, according to the soil quality, cultivation, and fertilization of each field, they wrote down cultivation records, specifically analyzed production potential, and formulated production increase plans for each field according to local conditions.
    In the process of formulating and revising production plans, the county committee strengthened its inspection of the production preparation situation in various townships and cooperatives, preventing and correcting the shortcomings of some cooperatives that were only satisfied with formulating plans and relaxing preparation work. For example, after Hexing Township inspected and found that fertilizer preparation was insufficient, the Party branch immediately mobilized the masses to use methods such as burning stove soil, digging thousand-foot mud, and self-making granular fertilizer, creating more than one million jin of fertilizer in a few days.
    After breaking down the conservative thinking of cadres and the masses, the county committee promptly paid attention to correcting the tendency of some cooperatives to blindly pursue high targets regardless of conditions and possibilities. The county committee mobilized these cooperatives to submit their plans to the masses for discussion, realistically revised the production increase targets, making the plans more realistic, which also improved the confidence and production enthusiasm of the masses in completing the production plans.
    In order to turn the production increase plan into the actions of the broad masses, while carrying out team formation and dividing cultivation areas, the contracting system was also universally promoted in the county's 658 agricultural cooperatives. In formulating labor allocation plans, all townships conducted comprehensive arrangements and planning for labor. In addition to formulating labor dispatch plans for the entire cooperative and team based on production needs, each township also made specific arrangements for the types and quantity of work that each member should perform throughout the year and in each production season, combining the collective production plan of the entire cooperative with the daily production activities of individual members, universally leveraging labor potential. The labor attendance rate of the county's cooperatives increased by 30% to 60% compared to last year. With the increase in labor utilization, improving soil, intensive cultivation, and changing the cropping system had a reliable guarantee.
    In implementing the production increase plan, the county committee also conducted various material and technical preparations in a timely manner according to the new situation. For example, in order to solve the problem of insufficient cattle power in the county after the expansion of multiple cropping areas and the promotion of double-wheeled double-shared plows, the county committee, in addition to mobilizing the masses to purchase more than 400 head of cattle from outside, also conducted large-scale adjustments of cattle throughout the county according to the differences in the cultivation season. At the same time, by using the method of uniformly establishing cattle farming teams, matching cattle according to their strength and the lightness of the work, the cultivation efficiency was universally improved. In the past, each head of cattle in Daping Township could only cultivate eight mu of tobacco fields, but now, after the cattle are organized, it has increased to twelve mu. In addition, with the promotion of advanced cultivation methods such as rational close planting and planting "fertilized seedlings" and "shaved seedlings," the county also planned to improve the old production tools. The old-fashioned weeding rakes were originally about one foot long, which were not suitable for closely planting seedlings eight inches apart. Now, 120,000 rakes have been re-manufactured according to the close planting specifications. In order to make the technical force keep up with the needs of production increase, six technical training courses were also held to promote fine varieties, plant double-season rice, manufacture fertilizers, and soak seeds in warm beds to train technicians and establish technical dissemination stations.
    Since the county has extensively implemented increasing planting, intercropping, and relay cropping, the seasons, times, and interconnections of crop sowing must be properly arranged. Last year, due to the late sowing of millet, the yield of autumn sweet potatoes and potatoes was reduced. This year, the county committee guided the entire county to universally adopt the method of planting dry seedlings to advance the maturity period of rice by fifteen days, and properly arranged the seasonal connections for increasing the planting of late rice, sweet potatoes, and potatoes to ensure the realization of the production increase plan.

    从各方面做好春耕准备工作
    本报记者　纪希晨
    四川郫县从去年冬天建立合作社以来，就以发展生产巩固新社为中心，全面地开展了春耕准备工作。现在全县烟、麻、春马铃薯已经提前播种完毕，二十多万亩麦子、油菜也都普遍追施过三四道肥料，大春生产所需的种子、肥料、农具等，在春耕开始前的两个月就基本上做好了准备。
    实现农业合作化以后，中共郫县县委首先抓紧了制定先进可靠的增产计划这一中心环节，作为开展农业增产运动的推动力量。为了打破农业增产上的保守思想，县委除正面教育干部认识合作化给增产带来的有利条件，深入总结当地每亩千斤以上的增产经验以外，还采用深入群众、深入田间的方法，来制定和修正生产计划。从县委到支部，都普遍深入到一个乡、一个社和一个生产队中，依靠广大积极分子，深入田间，逐块进行生产调查和土地耕作鉴定；然后根据每块田的土质、耕作、施肥情况，写下耕作记录，具体分析生产潜力，因地制宜地制定出每块田的增产计划。
    在制定和修正生产计划的过程中，县委加强了对各个乡和社生产准备情况的检查，防止和纠正了有些合作社只满足于制定计划而放松准备工作的缺点。如合兴乡检查出肥料准备不足的情况后，党支部马上动员群众用烧灶土，挖千脚泥和自制颗粒肥的方法，在几天内造了一百多万斤肥料。
    在打破了干部和群众的保守思想以后，县委又及时地注意纠正了有些合作社不顾条件和可能，盲目追求高额指标的倾向。县委发动这些合作社把计划交给群众讨论，实事求是地修改了增产指标，使计划更加切合实际，从而也就提高了群众完成生产计划的信心和生产积极性。
    为着把增产计划变成广大群众的行动，在进行编队、划分耕作区的同时，还在全县658个农业合作社中普遍推行了包工包产制度。在制定劳动配备计划中，各乡对劳动力进行了全面安排和规划。各乡除根据生产需要，制定了全社和队的劳力调派计划外，还对每个社员全年及各个生产季节应出的工种、数量进行了具体安排，使全社的集体生产计划，同社员个人的日常生产活动结合起来，普遍发挥了劳动潜在力。全县合作社的劳动出工率比去年增加了30％至60％。随着劳动利用率的提高，改良土壤、精耕细作、改变耕作制度，就有了可靠的保证。
    贯彻执行增产计划中，县委还根据新情况，及时地进行了各种物质的和技术的准备工作。例如为着解决复种面积扩大和双轮双铧犁推广后全县牛力不足的问题，县委除发动群众向外购买四百多头耕牛外，还根据耕作季节的差别，在全县范围内进行了耕牛大调剂，同时，用统一建立耕牛小组的方法，按牛力强弱、活路轻重，相互搭配，普遍提高了耕作效率。大平乡原来一头牛只能耕种八亩烟田，现在耕牛组织起来后，已经增加到十二亩。此外，随着合理密植、栽“包粪秧”“铲铲秧”等先进耕作方法的推广，全县对于旧的生产工具也有计划地进行了改良。原来薅秧的老式钉耙都是一尺左右，不适宜于密栽八寸的秧距，如今根据密植规格，重新制造了十二万把钉耙。为使技术力量赶上增产的需要，还举办了推广良种、种双季稻、制造肥料、温床浸芽等六个技术训练班，培养技术人员，建立技术传授站。
    由于全县大量实行增种、间种和套种，农作物播种的季节、时间和相互间的衔接问题就要做妥善安排。去年，由于谷子播种较晚，减少了秋甘薯和马铃薯的产量。今年，县委指导全县，普遍采用栽旱秧的方法，把水稻成熟期提早十五天，并且妥善地安排了增种晚稻、甘薯、马铃薯的季节衔接问题，以保证增产计划的实现。
