Xinhua News Agency, 4th. Vice Premier of the State Council, Chen Yi, attended the second council meeting (expanded) of the Chinese Writers Association on the morning of the 3rd, and spoke on the issue of developing literary and artistic creation.

    Chen Yi first pointed out in his speech that the issues discussed at this meeting, such as developing and prospering literary and artistic creation, cultivating young writers, and developing the literary and artistic undertakings of fraternal ethnic groups, are all very important. He hoped that the representatives present could fully discuss the issues and use the spirit of criticism and self-criticism to achieve satisfactory solutions.

    Chen Yi then talked about the importance of improving political cultivation and studying Marxism-Leninism for writers. He cited facts to point out that the significant achievements in literary and artistic creation over the past few years are inseparable from the achievements in political study and ideological transformation. In order to prosper the cause of literature and art, more ideological work will need to be done in the future. The more seriously writers treat literary and artistic creation, the more they will feel the importance of studying Marxism-Leninism. In the future, writers should combine the study of political theory with the improvement of artistic cultivation, and constantly improve their political and ideological level and skills.

    Chen Yi also talked about how writers should understand and grasp socialist realism. He said that socialist realism is also idealistic realism. Chen Yi said that writers should have communist ideals. With this kind of ideal, they can carry out keen analysis and precise synthesis when they come into contact with life; on the other hand, writers must also rely on the experience of actual life to inspire their thoughts and find an inexhaustible source for their own creation. Chen Yi pointed out that the main reasons for the emergence of formalism and naturalism in works are that writers have a low level of thought, insufficient practical experience, lack of analytical ability of actual life, and lack of hard training in artistic skills. Chen Yi also talked about the importance of writers correctly understanding and treating the national cultural heritage. He hoped that writers could proceed from China's actual situation, learn from and absorb the strengths of literature and art from other countries and nations, develop the spirit of independent thinking, and creatively master the principles of socialist realism.

    Finally, Chen Yi focused on the fact that writers should fully exert their socialist labor enthusiasm. He said that the Party and the government are taking various measures to ensure the necessary conditions for writers to carry out their creations as much as possible, but the prosperity of literary and artistic creation mainly depends on the efforts of the writers themselves. Writers should treat literary and artistic creation more seriously in the future, work hard and tenaciously, and create more and better works.

    在中国作家协会理事会扩大会议上
    陈毅副总理谈发展文艺创作问题
    新华社4日讯  国务院副总理陈毅3日上午出席了中国作家协会第二次理事会会议（扩大），并且就发展文艺创作问题讲了话。
    陈毅在讲话中首先指出，这次会议讨论发展和繁荣文艺创作、培养青年作家、发展兄弟民族文艺事业等问题都是很重要的，希望到会代表能充分展开讨论，发扬批评与自我批评精神使问题得到圆满的解决。
    陈毅接着谈到了提高政治修养、学习马克思列宁主义对于作家的重要意义。他列举事实指出几年来文艺创作上的重大收获，和几年来政治学习和思想改造的成绩是分不开的，为了繁荣文艺事业，今后还要作更多的思想工作。作家们越严肃地对待文艺创作，就会越感到学习马克思列宁主义的重要。今后作家们应当把政治理论学习同提高艺术修养很好地结合起来，不断地提高自己的政治思想水平和技巧。
    陈毅还谈到了作家如何理解和掌握社会主义现实主义的问题。他说，社会主义现实主义也就是有理想的现实主义。陈毅说，作家应当有共产主义的理想，有了这种理想，在他们接触生活的时候，才能进行锐敏的分析与精密的综合；另一方面作家也必须依靠实际生活的体验来启发自己的思想，替作家自己的创作找到取之不尽的泉源。陈毅指出，作品中产生公式主义和自然主义倾向的主要原因，是作家思想水平不高，实际生活不够丰富，对实际生活没有分析能力，并且对艺术技巧缺乏艰苦锻炼。陈毅还谈到作家必须正确地认识和对待民族文化遗产的重要性。他希望作家能够从中国的实际情况出发，学习和吸收其他国家和民族的文学艺术的长处，发挥独立思考的精神，创造性地掌握社会主义现实主义的原则。
    陈毅最后着重谈到作家应当充分发挥社会主义的劳动热情。他说，党和政府正在采取各种措施，尽可能保证作家进行创作的必要条件，但要使文艺创作繁荣，主要还是要依靠作家自己的努力。作家们今后应当更加严肃地对待文艺创作，艰苦顽强地劳动，创作出更多、更好的作品来。
