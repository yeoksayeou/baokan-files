    Change This Unreasonable Rule

    To the Editor:
    In the Hohhot Woolen Mill in Inner Mongolia, there are currently 108 households of workers with families. Due to insufficient public housing, only 43 households of workers can live in factory dormitories, while the remaining 65 households live in civilian housing in the streets. The factory stipulates that family members of workers living in public dormitories can process and sew sweaters for the factory, but family members of workers living in the streets cannot. As a result, those living in public dormitories not only have better housing conditions but can also increase their sideline income by about 15 yuan per month; while those living in civilian housing have neither sideline income nor good living conditions.

    According to a survey, all the struggling households in the factory are those living in the streets. These workers and their families often get sick due to poor living conditions, have heavy burdens, and have no sideline income, making their lives very difficult. For example, the room where worker Wang Fu lives has cracks in the gable walls that let the light in, and there is no storm door; in winter, they hang half a tattered sack outside. Last year, his wife contracted postpartum illness because the house was drafty, and she still hasn't recovered. Another example is worker Liu Zhizhou's home, where the indoor air is not circulated, the walls are black, damp, and crumbling, and there is no ceiling. His child is often sick, mostly with stomach and lung problems.

    The Hohhot Woolen Mill cannot solve the housing problem for all employees, which is certainly due to objective difficulties; but the scope of processing and sewing sweaters for workers' families can be expanded, and it should not be limited to family members living in public dormitories while denying the opportunity to those living in civilian housing in the streets. For those workers who are particularly impoverished and have particularly poor living conditions, every effort should be made to solve their housing problems, and once public housing becomes available, they should be the first to be moved in.

    改变这个不合理的规定编辑同志：
    内蒙古呼和浩特毛织厂现在一共有108户带家的职工。由于公有房屋不够分配，只能有43户职工住在公家宿舍，其余的65户都住在街道民房里。厂里规定住公家宿舍的职工家属可以替工厂加工缝毛衣，住街道的职工家属不能缝。这样一来，住公家宿舍的不但可以住到条件较好的房子，而且每月可以增加副业收入15元左右；而住街道民房的呢，既没有副业收入，居住条件又差。
    据调查，这个厂里职工中的困难户全部是住在街道上的。这些职工及其家属由于居住条件恶劣，经常生病，负担既重，又没有副业收入，因而生活很困难。如工人王富所住的一间房，山墙上的裂缝透着天，没有风门，冬天外边挂半条烂麻袋；去年他老婆生孩子就因为房子透风得了月子病，到现在还没好。又如工人刘志周的家，因为屋内空气不流通，墙壁污黑、潮湿、掉土，上边没有顶棚，他的小孩就经常闹病，所得的病大都是胃部和肺部的毛病。
    呼和浩特毛织厂不能解决全部职工的住宿问题，固然是因为客观上有困难；但是给职工家属加工缝毛衣就可以把范围放大一些，不能只让住公家宿舍的家属缝而不给住街道民房的家属缝。对于那些生活特别困难、居住条件特别恶劣的职工，更应该尽力设法解决他们的住房问题，一旦公家房屋有空，就应首先让他们搬进来。
