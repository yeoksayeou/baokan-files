    Twenty-Two Coal Mining Units Complete First Quarter Coal Production Plan Ahead of Schedule
    Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Increases Pig Iron Production by More Than 3,000 Tons in Two Months
    According to incomplete statistics up to March 24th, among the national state-owned and centrally-managed state-private joint coal mines nationwide, twenty-two units have completed their first-quarter coal production plans seven days ahead of schedule. It is estimated that by the end of the first quarter, these units will have produced more than 490,000 tons of raw coal for the country. In the socialist competition, the mines actively learn and promote advanced experience. The Jiaozuo Mining Bureau promoted advanced experience such as the "one-shift coal mining system" and completed the first quarter coal production task evenly and safely on the 24th.
    As of the 28th, more than 30 state-owned and locally state-owned factories and mines in Beijing had completed their first-quarter production plans for this year ahead of schedule. Workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant conscientiously studied advanced experiences such as humidified blast and rapid combustion methods, increasing pig iron production by more than 3,200 tons in January and February. The Beijing Xinhua Printing Factory has created 124 new production records in the past three months. Workers at the state-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, which has only been in production for half a year, launched a "comprehensive completion of the state plan, no defective products workday competition," with a standard cotton yarn rate of 100% and a prime cloth rate of 99.93%.

    二十二个煤矿单位提前完成第一季度产煤计划
    石景山钢铁厂两个月增产三千多吨生铁
    根据到三月二十四日的不完全统计，全国国营和中央管理的公私合营煤矿中，已经有二十二个单位提前七天完成了第一季度产煤计划，预计到第一季度末这些单位可以为国家多生产原煤四十九万多吨。各矿在社会主义竞赛中，积极学习和推广先进经验。焦作矿务局推广“一班采煤制”等先进经验，在二十四日均衡地、安全地完成了第一季度产煤任务。
    北京市到二十八日止已经有三十多个国营、地方国营工厂矿山提前完成了今年第一季度生产计划。石景山钢铁厂工人认真学习加湿鼓风和快速燃烧法等先进经验，一、二两月份增产了三千二百多吨生铁。北京新华印刷厂近三个月共创造了124次生产新纪录。刚开工生产半年的国营北京第二棉纺织厂工人，开展了全面完成国家计划、不出次品工作日竞赛，棉纱标准品率达到100％，平布正布率达到99.93％。　（据新华社讯）
