    New Type of Electric Light Made with Semiconductor Materials
    Wu Boxi, a lecturer in the Physics Department of Xiamen University, and Jiang Peixuan, a lecturer in the Chemistry Department, are researching a new type of electric light made from a semiconductor material. This electric light does not use a vacuum glass bulb or tungsten wire; it uses only a piece of glass with the semiconductor material attached. When electricity is passed through it, it emits light. Its electrical energy usage will be more than ten times better than ordinary electric lights, and its lifespan will reach 100,000 hours.
    The leadership of Xiamen University is giving strong support to this research work and is specially building a dust-free laboratory for the researchers.

    用半导体材料制造新型电灯
    厦门大学物理系讲师吴伯僖和化学系讲师江培萱正在研究用一种半导体的材料制造一种新型的电灯。这种电灯不用真空玻璃泡和钨丝，只用一块粘着半导体材料的玻璃片，通上电流，就会发光。它的电能使用将比普通电灯提高十多倍，使用期限将达十万小时。
    厦门大学领导方面对这项研究工作给予大力支持，正在为研究者专门修建一座绝尘的试验室。
