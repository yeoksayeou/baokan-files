Zhejiang Province will change farming systems on 70% of its cultivated land this year. Among these changes, continuous cropping of rice and intercropping of rice will account for about 50% of the paddy field area, and replacing low-yield crops with high-yield crops will account for 20% of the cultivated land area. Through these measures, the province's total grain output this year can reach 17 billion jin, an increase of 1.4% over last year.

Currently, agricultural technology training classes are being held in various locations, with a total of 900,000 people participating in the training.丰产丰产[correction: Abundant harvest] experience exchange conferences have been held universally in various counties; a mass movement to build farmland water conservancy projects and accumulate fertilizer has been launched throughout the province; agricultural and grain departments in various locations have also transferred and transported more than 29.8 million jin of high-quality rice seeds to supply to various agricultural production cooperatives.

    浙江70％耕地将改变耕作制度
    浙江省今年将在70％的耕地上改变耕作制度。其中连作稻和间作稻种植面积将占水田面积的50％左右，低产作物改高产作物占耕地面积20％。通过这些措施，今年全省粮食产量可达到170亿斤，比去年增产1.4％。
    现在，各地正在举办农业技术训练班，参加学习的人数将共有90万名。各县普遍召开了丰产经验交流大会；全省已经掀起了群众性的兴修农田水利和积肥运动；各地农业和粮食部门还调运了2，980多万斤水稻良种供应各个农业生产合作社。
