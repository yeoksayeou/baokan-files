Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 5th (TASS): It has been reported that the governments of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have sent letters suggesting that the two co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference on Indochina (namely, the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union and Great Britain, as is well known) should reconvene the conference to discuss measures for implementing the Geneva Accords on Vietnam.

On February 18th of this year, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to the British Embassy in Moscow on this matter.

In the note, the Soviet government drew attention to the fact that the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam remains unsatisfactory. The South Vietnamese authorities resolutely refuse to consult on holding general elections in Vietnam in July 1956, as stipulated in the Geneva Accords, a point already noted by the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Vietnam in its fourth report. The work of the International Commission for Vietnam is frequently obstructed by the South Vietnamese authorities. Moreover, the South Vietnamese authorities have announced their decision to carry out unilateral elections and other measures to divide Vietnam within South Vietnam, thereby undermining the Geneva Accords on Vietnam.

The Soviet government believes that the non-implementation of the Geneva Accords on Vietnam has had extremely serious consequences for the cause of peace in Indochina and for the cause of peace throughout the world.

Considering the seriousness of the situation in Vietnam, and considering that the measures taken not long ago by the two chairmen to improve this situation have not achieved good results, the Soviet government will express its agreement with the views of the governments of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and considers it appropriate to reconvene a conference to study measures to implement the Geneva Accords in Vietnam.

The Soviet government believes that it is appropriate for the two chairmen to support the suggestion to convene the aforementioned conference, and to send letters on this matter to the countries participating in the Geneva Conference on Indochina and the member states of the International Commission for Indochina.

A response from the British government has not yet been received.

    苏联照会英国表示同意重新召开日内瓦会议
    新华社6日讯  塔斯社莫斯科5日讯：报纸前已报道，中华人民共和国政府和越南民主共和国政府就印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的两位主席（即大家所知道的苏联和英国的外交部长）的信件提出了建议，要求重新召开会议讨论实现关于越南的日内瓦协定的措施的问题。
    今年2月18日，苏联外交部就这个问题向英国驻莫斯科大使馆致送了一份照会。
    在照会中苏联政府提请注意，在越南，日内瓦协定的执行情况依然不能令人满意。南越当局坚决拒绝按照日内瓦协定的规定就1956年7月在越南举行普选一事进行协商，越南国际监督和监察委员会在第四次报告中已经注意到这一点。越南国际委员会的工作经常遭到南越当局的阻挠。不仅如此，南越当局已经宣布决定在南越境内实行片面选举和实行其它的分裂越南的措施，这样就破坏了关于越南问题的日内瓦协定。
    苏联政府认为，关于越南问题的日内瓦协定没有被执行，给印度支那的和平事业以及全世界的和平事业带来了极其严重的后果。
    苏联政府考虑到在越南所发生的情况的严重性，考虑到两位主席不久以前所采取的改善这种情况的措施并未取得良好结果，将表示同意中华人民共和国政府和越南民主共和国政府的意见，认为重新召开会议来研究在越南贯彻日内瓦协定的措施是适宜的。
    苏联政府认为，两位主席支持关于召开上述会议的建议，并且就这个问题致函印度支那问题日内瓦会议参加国和印度支那国际委员会成员国是适合的。
    现在还没有得到英国政府的回答。
