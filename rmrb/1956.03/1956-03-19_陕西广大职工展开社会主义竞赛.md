The broad masses of workers in Shaanxi Province are enthusiastically launching socialist emulation campaigns. Currently, over 80% of factories and mines and over half of the engineering units have proposed to strive for early completion of the First Five-Year Plan. More than 20 factories and 10 engineering companies are participating in nationwide inter-factory competitions.

In the competitions, many workers have broken old quotas and created new records. According to incomplete statistics from 27 units, workers have proposed more than 4,000 rationalization proposals. Some of these proposals, once adopted, can increase efficiency by thirty-nine times. All 152 teams in the sixth work zone of the Northwest Engineering Bureau's Second Company exceeded their planned quotas, averaging 34.64% over the plan. The No. 508 drilling rig of the Tongchuan 131 Exploration Team completed 46 days' worth of work in 20 days and set a new record of 42.88 meters drilled per day.
