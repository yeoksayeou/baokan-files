    Let Agricultural Cooperative Cadres Have Time to Lead Spring Plowing Production
		(I) Editor:
    The spring plowing season is about to begin, but the spring plowing preparation work of Shanghua Agricultural Production Cooperative is still very poor: water conservancy projects have not been repaired, fertilizer accumulation plans have not been completed, and there are still many problems to be solved in the preparation of farm tools, draught cattle, and seeds. The members are anxiously saying: "If we don't hurry, the plan will fall through."
    The leaders of the cooperative also know this situation, but they are tied up by a series of meetings and have no time to arrange and lead the production of the cooperative. For example, Chen Rihong, the captain of the Second Brigade, attended a meeting at the supply and marketing cooperative on February 12 to study the supply of means of production. After returning, he wanted to check the material preparation work for spring plowing in the entire team. However, two or three days later, the superior notified him to participate in the construction committee of the Gaochao Highway, giving him a new task. On the 19th, he participated in the Party branch committee to study the merger of credit cooperatives, and on the 20th and 21st, he also participated in the full township credit cooperative representative meeting. On the 22nd, the entire township organized field inspections, and he also participated. On the 23rd, he was studying the current production problems with the agricultural cooperative management committee. Before the meeting was over, the district committee called him to discuss work. On the 24th, he finally took the time to hurriedly convey the contents of the meetings to the members and arranged eight tasks, including spring plowing preparation, increasing credit cooperative shares, and recovering agricultural loans. On the 25th, he was about to go to the small team to specifically study the preparation for spring plowing, but another notice came, calling him to immediately participate in the meeting of the Gaochao Highway Construction Committee. Then, he participated in the district technical training class. For example, Chen Zonglie, the captain of the Fifth Brigade, held 8 days and 10 nights of meetings in half a month. On February 21, he was determined to go to carry pond mud with the members, but as soon as he wanted to go out, another notice came, calling him to participate in the credit cooperative representative meeting. According to statistics on February 28, there were 129 cadres of all levels in the entire cooperative attending meetings. Deputy Director Zhao Tongcheng received five notices in one day, anxiously rushing to the cooperative to ask: "Which meeting should I go to?" Township cadre Yu Shouhai also said: "During this period, the township government's notices are like rain."
    Too many meetings affect production, which is an old problem. However, the leadership of some departments does not accept the lessons of the past and is still accustomed to using meetings to lead work. This situation must be changed immediately. It is recommended that relevant leading departments properly arrange work, and during the spring plowing period, meetings that can be avoided should be resolutely avoided, and meetings that can be postponed should be resolutely postponed; at the same time, the directors and production team leaders of the cooperatives should not hold too many concurrent positions, so that they can concentrate on leading production.

			(II) Editor:
    In early March, when the rural areas are very busy with preparations for farming, some cadres of Sanchakou Township and Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Longguan County, Hebei Province, were dragged to county meetings one after another due to notices from the county. According to our understanding, from February 23 to March 12, a total of 18 days, 40 people from this township and agricultural cooperative went to the county to participate in 8 meetings, and 8 people went to various training classes for a total of 270 working days. From March 4 to 8 alone, 23 people simultaneously went to the county to participate in various meetings. In addition, county-level agencies issued many documents to the township. On March 3 alone, the Sanchakou Township Party Branch and instructor received 12 documents, totaling more than 19,000 words. This is also a heavy burden for rural cadres with lower cultural levels! These agencies that convene meetings and issue documents all hope to promote work through documents and meetings; however, the result of too many documents and meetings is precisely unfavorable to work. Township and cooperative cadres are busy attending meetings and reading documents, so they do not have enough time to lead production. Meetings are held one after another, and time is tight. It is impossible to conscientiously implement all the work arranged at each meeting. If the cooperative cadres attend too many meetings and delay production, the cooperative has to give them extra work points, which will also affect the income of the members. This unfavorable situation for production should be changed so that township and cooperative cadres have enough time to lead production.

### 让农业社干部有时间领导春耕生产

    让农业社干部有时间领导春耕生产		（一）编辑同志：
    春耕季节马上就要开始了，可是，上华农业生产合作社的准备春耕工作还做得很差：水利工程没有修好，积肥计划没有完成，农具、耕牛、种籽等的准备工作中也还有不少问题需要解决。社员们很着急地说：“再不抓紧，计划要落空了。”
    社里的领导人员也知道这个情况，可是他们被一连串的会议拴住了，没有时间来安排和领导社里的生产。例如，第二大队队长陈日洪2月12日在供销社开会研究了生产资料的供应问题，回来以后就想把全队春耕生产的物质准备工作检查一下。但是两三天后，上级通知他参加高潮公路的修建委员会，给了他新的任务。19日，他参加党支部委员会研究了信用合作社的合并问题，20日和21日又参加了全乡信用社代表会议。22日全乡组织田间检查，他也参加了。23日他正在农业社管理委员会研究当前生产问题，会还没有开完，区委又来电话叫他去商量工作。24日，他总算抽出时间向社员匆匆忙忙传达了一下各处开会的内容，布置了春耕准备、信用社增加股金、收回农贷等八项工作。25日，他正想到小队去具体研究一下准备春耕工作情况，可是通知又来了，叫他马上去参加高潮公路修建委员会的会议。接着，他又参加了区技术训练班。又如，第五大队队长陈宗烈在半个月时间内，开了8天10夜的会议。2月21日，他下决心要同社员一起去挑塘泥，刚想出门，通知又来了，叫他去参加信用社代表会议。据2月28日统计，全社大小干部出席会议的就有129人。副社长赵统成一天接到五个通知，急得他赶到社里来问：“究竟去开那个会好？”乡干部余寿海也说：“这段时间乡政府的通知，真像下雨一样。”
    会议过多，影响生产，这已经是一个老问题了。可是，某些部门的领导方面却不接受过去的教训，仍然习惯于用会议领导工作的方法。这种情况必须立即改变。建议有关领导部门妥善安排工作，在春耕期间，可开可不开的会议坚决不开，可缓开的会议坚决缓开；同时，应该使合作社的主任和生产队长等干部不要兼职过多，让他们能够专心领导生产。

            （二）编辑同志：
    3月初，正是农村备耕工作很紧张的时候，河北省龙关县三岔口乡和乡里先锋农业社的一部分干部，却被县里一个又一个的通知拉去开会了。根据我们了解，从2月23日到3月12日的18天当中，这个乡和农业社里就有40个人到县里去参加8个会议，有8个人到各种训练班学习，一共占270个工作日。只3月4日至8日，就有23个人同时到县里参加各种会议。另外，县级各机关发给乡里的文件也很多。只3月3日一天，三岔口乡党支部和指导员就接到文件12件，约19，000多字。这对于文化水平较低的乡村干部说来也是一种沉重的负担！这些召开会议和发出文件的机关，都是满心希望通过文件和会议来推动工作；但是文件、会议过多所造成的结果却恰恰不利于工作。乡里和社里的干部忙着开会、看文件，就没有足够的时间来领导生产了。会议连着开，时间挺紧迫，每个会议所布置的工作不可能全都认真贯彻执行。社里的干部开会太多耽误了生产，还得社里给补记工分，还会影响社员收入。这种不利于生产的情况，应该改变，以便让乡里和社里的干部有足够的领导生产的时间。
