    Hearing Aid for the Deaf Successfully Trial-Produced

    A hearing aid to help people with hearing impairments restore normal hearing has been successfully trial-produced by Pan Dashu, a young capitalist in the jointly-owned Tongji Instrument Manufacturing Factory, and technician Wu Peishu. This hearing aid was tested by a 70-year-old man with some hearing loss, and as a result, he was able to hear external sounds clearly.

    Pan Dashu and Wu Peishu's research and trial production of this new product had already achieved preliminary results as early as March of last year; however, the work was suspended because the sensitivity and fidelity of the microphone, a major component, could not be resolved. In late January of this year, encouraged by the high tide of socialist transformation and with the care and support of the public representative, they continued their efforts and finally trial-produced a special magnetic microphone. The performance of the hearing aid assembled with this microphone fully meets the standards, and it can maintain normal effectiveness even under unfavorable temperature and humidity conditions. The factory is now preparing to start producing this new product in the second quarter. (Xinhua News Agency)

    耳聋助听器试制成功
    一种帮助耳朵有点聋的人恢复正常听觉的耳聋助听器，已由公私合营同济仪器制造厂青年资本家潘大树和技工吴沛枢共同试制成功。这种耳聋助听器曾由一个耳朵有些聋的七十多岁的老人试用，结果能听清外界的声音。
    潘大树和吴沛枢对这种新产品的研究、试制工作早在去年三月就取得了初步的成果；但因解决不了其中主要部件微音器的灵敏度和传真度不够的问题，就把这工作停了下来。今年一月下旬，他们在社会主义改造高潮的鼓舞和公方代表的关怀和支持下，继续努力，终于试制成一种特种的磁性微音器，用这种微音器装配成的耳聋助听器的性能完全符合标准，即使在不良的气温和湿度条件下也能保持正常效用。现在这个厂已准备在第二季度开始生产这种新产品。（新华社）
