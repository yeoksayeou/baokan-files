Xinhua News Agency, 5th. The Second Council Meeting (Enlarged) of the Chinese Writers Association began its plenary speeches on the 2nd. As of today, 32 writers have expressed their opinions on issues such as the development and prosperity of literary creation, and have enthusiastically carried out criticism and self-criticism.

The writers' speeches were filled with socialist enthusiasm. Ba Jin said that today, we can all feel how close the hearts of the people are to the hearts of the writers. It is indeed a great happiness to be a writer in New China. In order to live up to this happiness, let us ignite the undying fire in our hearts and dedicate ourselves wholeheartedly to the socialist literary and art cause. In his speech, Ba Jin also emphasized that writers must work tenaciously and seriously. He said that even if a writer has written ten good works, when he writes his eleventh novel, he should still put in all his energy as if he were a beginner. Many writers talked about their determination and creative plans in their speeches. Playwright Li Bozhao said that she would complete the revision of the opera "The Long March" as soon as possible. Writer Sun Junqing said that when Chairman Mao and many responsible comrades of the Party Central Committee took photos with us in the wind and snow, my heart was filled with excitement and uneasiness. What do we use to respond to the care and expectations of the Party and the people? Pride, complacency, and laziness? No. We must treat our cause with infinite loyalty. We should prevent arrogance, especially among our young people.

The writers also focused on discussing going deep into life and how to overcome formalism and naturalism in their works. Playwright Cao Yu, poets Zang Kejia, Yuan Shuipai, Ai Qing, writer Liu Qing, and others all spoke from their own experiences, saying that if writers want to overcome formalism and naturalism in their creation, the most important thing is to go deep into life and strengthen their ideological and artistic cultivation. Cao Yu said that under formalistic works, there often lies a low level of thought and a lack of practical life. Since formalistic works are not real, an honest and diligent writer should not make this mistake. Young writer Gu Yu examined the naturalistic tendencies shown in his works, mainly because he was detached from life and the content of his works in the creative process, pursuing form and technique in isolation, and neglecting political study. He said that in the future, I will go deep into life, as quickly and decisively as a bullet being fired.

The writers expressed many opinions on the draft 12-year work program put forward by the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association. In his speech, Zhao Xun criticized the Writers Association for not giving due attention to leading and organizing drama creation in the past. Many writers pointed out that it is necessary to overcome the tendency of liberalism in literary and artistic theoretical criticism. Mongolian poet Na. Sayinchogt, Uyghur writer Ziya, and Korean writer Li Hongkui provided many useful suggestions for the development of the literary and artistic undertakings of various ethnic minorities. Yu Heiding and others put forward many effective experiences for training young authors. Ma Jia put forward opinions on improving the work of the Shenyang branch of the Writers Association in his speech. Many other writers also expressed their opinions on the creation of film scripts, children's literature, literary education, and international literary exchanges.

    作家协会理事会会议进行大会发言
    新华社5日讯  中国作家协会第二次理事会会议（扩大）从2日开始进行大会发言，到今天为止，已经有32位作家就发展和繁荣文艺创作等问题发表了意见，热烈地开展了批评与自我批评。
    作家们的发言中，洋溢着社会主义的热情。巴金说，今天，我们都会感觉到人民的心跟作家的心挨得多么近，做一个新中国的作家的确是莫大的幸福。为了不辜负这种幸福，让我们燃起不灭的心灵的火，全心全意地献身于社会主义的文艺事业。巴金在发言中还强调指出作家必须顽强、严肃地劳动，他说，一个作家即使写过十部好作品，但当他写第十一本小说的时候，他还应当像初学写作那样拿出全副精力。许多作家在发言中，谈到了自己的决心和创作规划。剧作家李伯钊表示，要尽快地完成歌剧“长征”的修改工作。作家孙峻青说，当毛主席和党中央许多负责同志冒着风雪同我们一起拍照片的时候，我的心里充满了激动和不安。我们用什么来回答党和人民对我们的关怀和期待？用骄傲自满和消极懒惰吗？不能。我们必须用无限的忠诚来对待我们的事业。应当防止骄傲，特别是我们年轻的人。
    作家们还着重讨论了深入生活以及如何克服作品中的公式主义和自然主义的问题。剧作家曹禺，诗人臧克家、袁水拍、艾青，作家柳青等先后都从切身感受谈到：作家要想克服创作上的公式主义和自然主义，最主要的是要深入生活，加强思想和艺术修养。曹禺说，在公式化的作品的下边，经常掩盖着思想水平的低下和实际生活的缺乏。公式化的作品既然是不真实的，一个老老实实、勤勤恳恳的作家就不应当犯这个毛病。青年作家谷峪检查了他的作品中表现出自然主义的倾向，主要是由于他在创作过程中脱离生活、脱离作品内容，孤立地追求形式和技巧，忽视政治学习。他说，我今后要深入到生活中去，要像枪弹发射出去那样迅速和坚决。
    作家们在发言中就中国作家协会主席团提出的12年工作纲要草案，发表了不少意见。赵寻在发言中，批评作家协会过去对领导和组织戏剧创作未予以应有的重视。不少作家指出，必须克服文艺理论批评中的自由主义倾向。蒙古族诗人纳·赛音朝克图，维吾尔族作家孜亚，朝鲜族作家李弘奎对发展各兄弟民族文艺事业提供了不少有益的建议。于黑丁等对于培养青年作者提出了许多行之有效的经验。马加在发言中提出了改进作家协会沈阳分会的工作的意见。还有不少作家对电影剧本创作、儿童文学、文学教育、国际文学交流等工作发表了意见。
