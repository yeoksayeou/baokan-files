Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, March 1st: The Chinese Folk Art Troupe held an evening reception on the 29th for workers from all walks of life in Macau.

    The workers who attended the reception were very crowded, and there was no empty space even next to the seats. Although many programs had been re-performed and concluded multiple times, the audience repeatedly requested encore performances, some with more than ten curtain calls. As soon as a program ended, the entire audience stood up and applauded and cheered non-stop, shouting, "Good!" "Good!" Many workers said that every time they heard the songs "The East is Red" and "Ode to the Motherland," their whole body and mind were immediately filled with pride.

    More than 1,400 workers from all walks of life in Macau attended the reception that evening.

    中国民间艺术团举行晚会招待澳门各业工人
    新华社香港1日电　中国民间艺术团在29日举行了招待澳门各业工人的晚会。
    参加招待晚会的工人十分拥挤，连座椅旁边也找不到空余的地方。许多节目虽然已经重演和谢幕多次，但观众还是一再要求重演，有的谢幕达十多次。节目刚完，全场观众就站立起来，不停歇地鼓掌欢呼，“好呀！”“好呀！”许多工人说，每当一听到“东方红”和“歌唱祖国”的歌声的时候，整个身心就立刻充满着自豪和骄傲。
    当晚出席这个招待晚会的有澳门各业工人1，400多人。
