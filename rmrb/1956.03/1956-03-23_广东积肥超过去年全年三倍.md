    Guangdong's fertilizer accumulation exceeds last year's total by three times
    Before the early rice transplanting, Guangdong Province's farmers had already overfulfilled the original spring fertilizer accumulation plan of 2.5 billion dan by more than 900 million dan. The province's fertilizer accumulation this spring exceeds last year's total by more than three times. Thirty-nine counties have accumulated more than 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu.
    Many agricultural producers' cooperatives organized fertilizer accumulation expeditions to find fertilizer sources everywhere. In Heshui District, Xinyi County, more than 20,000 cooperative members went to the mountains dozens of miles away to cut yellow grass in the starry night. (Xinhua News Agency dispatch)

    广东积肥超过去年全年三倍
    广东省农民在早稻大插秧前，已经超额九亿多担完成了原定今春积肥25亿担的计划。全省今春积的肥料，比去年全年超过三倍多。有39个县每亩积肥超过了一万斤。
    许多农业生产合作社组织了积肥远征队，四处寻找肥源。信宜县合水区有两万多社员，星夜到几十里以外的大山去割黄草。（据新华社讯）
