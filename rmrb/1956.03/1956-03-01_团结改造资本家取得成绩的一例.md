An Example of Achieving Success in Uniting and Transforming Capitalists
By our reporter Xi Ping

    Shanghai Jiuxin Enamel Factory is the second largest enamel factory in Shanghai. The capitalist and factory director, Pan Shuangquan, has been engaged in enamel production for more than 30 years and is a technical veteran in Shanghai's enamel industry. When the public-private partnership was implemented in October 1954, capitalist Pan Shuangquan felt both happy and worried. He was happy that the public-private partnership could change the previous situation of losses and lead to development, but he was worried about his own future. Although he had technology and experience, he was illiterate, and his relationship with the workers was very poor due to his past rough style. Could he continue to hold a leadership position in the new enterprise?

    At that time, the Party branch of Jiuxin Enamel Factory made a detailed analysis and study of Pan Shuangquan's situation. It was believed that although Pan Shuangquan had serious capitalist ideas and style, he had technology and experience, and actively supported the public-private partnership. He should be allowed to assume some leadership responsibilities in the enterprise and gradually transform his ideology and work style in future practical work. The Party branch then submitted this suggestion to the administration. Finally, Pan Shuangquan was approved and appointed as the second deputy director of the factory, and was assigned to be responsible for the production of the enamel workshop, one of the important workshops in the factory. Pan Shuangquan was very moved by the country's arrangement. Since then, he has actively managed production, arriving at the factory at seven o'clock every morning and not returning home until seven or eight o'clock in the evening.

    After properly arranging Pan Shuangquan's position and ensuring that he had the authority to match his responsibilities, the Party organization of Jiuxin Enamel Factory continued to help him solve various problems that occurred in the work process and transform his ideology and work style. In the past, Pan Shuangquan consistently used beatings, scolding, and fines to manage workers. Not long after he became the second deputy director, he became arbitrary and dictatorial in managing production, which aroused great dissatisfaction among the workers.

    This capitalist management style has affected the improvement of enterprise management. At this time, the Party branch secretary and the public-share factory director (a Party member) talked to Pan Shuangquan, praised and encouraged his positive performance in production management, and at the same time, seriously pointed out his shortcomings in his work, telling him that in the new enterprise, he must trust the masses and rely on the masses, and consult with the masses on everything. In order to help Pan Shuangquan understand and overcome his capitalist ideas, the Party organization enlightened and guided him to understand the strength of the working masses in actual work and overcome his erroneous ideas of underestimating the workers and not relying on them. In the third quarter of last year, the factory launched a comprehensive conservation campaign and established four conservation groups centered on improving quality. The Party branch and the public-share factory director allowed him to participate in the leadership of the group. In this group, he was exposed to a large number of rationalization proposals from the working masses every day and heard many vivid stories of workers improving production. For example, the advanced coal adding method that he had been arguing with the workers about in the past is now being actively implemented by the workers. After coal adding worker Zhou Bingzhong further improved the coal adding method, not only did he reduce coal consumption, but he also increased the firepower of the coal. In the face of these facts, he gradually realized that it was wrong for him to underestimate the wisdom of the workers in the past. While helping Pan Shuangquan overcome capitalist ideas, the Party branch of Jiuxin Enamel Factory also educated the workers to unite and transform the capitalists, asking the workers to respect Pan Shuangquan's administrative position and support and implement the measures he proposed that were beneficial to production. In this way, the relationship between Pan Shuangquan and the workers gradually improved, and quarrels almost disappeared.

    At this time, Pan Shuangquan was tormented by another distress in his work, which was illiteracy. Illiteracy could be dealt with in the past, but in today's new enterprise, the difficulties are growing. Because he cannot read newspapers or books, and cannot take notes during reports, his political progress is affected. In his work, he cannot even understand the statistical reports of the workshop, and he needs to sign and seal various official documents, which makes him anxious and pessimistic. The Party branch comforted and encouraged him on the one hand, and suggested that the administration assign someone to help him on the other hand. When Pan Shuangquan attended important meetings in higher-level organs and needed to take notes, the factory sent someone to help him take notes. When reviewing various official documents, the factory designated someone to read the contents of the documents to him in detail so that he would be clear about what was going on. When the factory organized newspaper readings, Pan Shuangquan was always invited to participate. Sometimes, someone was asked to read to him specifically, and to explain to him the various important policy issues announced in the newspapers, to help him understand the current domestic and international affairs. In order to solve this problem fundamentally, the Party branch also encouraged him to learn culture from scratch. Under the enthusiastic encouragement of the Party branch, 53-year-old Pan Shuangquan finally entered the factory's workers' cultural spare time school and began his study life. He attended classes with the workers at school three nights a week, and usually reviewed and practiced writing at noon every day, studying very hard. He said: "It won't work to be illiterate in a socialist society. I want to go to socialism, and I am determined to learn it." With the continuous encouragement and help of the Party branch, after several months of hard study, Pan Shuangquan was able to read general letters and write ordinary notes. This made Pan Shuangquan more optimistic about his future, and his enthusiasm was also greatly improved.

    The Party branch of Jiuxin Enamel Factory promptly praised Pan Shuangquan's progressive performance. Last year, there were quality accidents of hemp and black spots in two products of the factory—the 34 cm single milk basin and the 30 cm flower tea basin—which could not be solved. Pan Shuangquan researched some methods to improve the quality to about 95%. Then, the workers further improved the operation methods on the basis of this improvement, and the quality reached 100%. Afterwards, the public-share factory director praised his deeds of actively improving quality, and asked him to learn a lesson from this matter and rely on the workers better in future work and accept the help of the working masses. The Party branch of the factory and the public-share representatives also adopted a sincere attitude to help Pan Shuangquan with the shortcomings and errors he exposed in his work, and guided him to conduct self-criticism. Recently, when studying and improving the quality of a product, Pan Shuangquan relied on his technology and looked down on the engineers, and quarreled with the engineers. After the meeting, the branch secretary and the public-share representative criticized him seriously and sincerely and analyzed him. Afterwards, Pan Shuangquan took the initiative to make a self-criticism to the engineer and admitted his shortcomings. In this way, Pan Shuangquan gradually became accustomed to criticism and self-criticism and moved closer to the Party branch.

    What deeply moved Pan Shuangquan was that after one year of the factory's joint venture, all aspects were completely new, and the enterprise quickly changed from loss to profit. Production continued to increase, and the quality was also continuously improved. Since August last year, the phenomenon of returns has been eliminated.

    The Party branch of Jiuxin Enamel Factory also gave Pan Shuangquan the due honor for his contribution in labor. When the factory selected advanced workers on February 8, Pan Shuangquan and the workers were rewarded and praised together, which once again encouraged Pan Shuangquan. He firmly stated that he must gradually abandon exploitation, overcome his capitalist ideas, and transform himself into a self-reliant laborer in response to the education of the Party and the working masses.

    团结改造资本家取得成绩的一例
    本报记者　习平
    上海久新搪瓷厂是上海第二家大型搪瓷厂，资本家、厂长潘双全从事搪瓷生产已有30多年，是上海搪瓷界有技术的前辈。当1954年10月实行公私合营以后，资本家潘双全的心情是既高兴又忧虑，高兴的是企业公私合营后，可以改变以前的亏损局面而得到发展，忧虑的是自己的前途怎样呢？他虽然有技术有经验，但是他不识字，而且由于他过去作风粗暴，和工人们的关系很不好，在新的企业里，能不能继续担任领导工作呢？
    当时，久新搪瓷厂党支部对潘双全的情况作了详细的分析研究，认为潘双全虽然有严重的资本主义思想和作风，但他有技术有经验，对公私合营积极拥护，应该让他担负一部分企业的领导职务，在今后实际工作中逐步改造他的思想作风。党支部便向行政上提出了这个建议。最后，潘双全便被批准任命为第二副厂长，并分工负责厂内重要车间之一——搪瓷车间的生产。潘双全对国家这样的安排十分感动，他从此积极的管理生产，每天早上七点钟就到厂，晚上七、八点钟才回家。
    久新搪瓷厂党组织在妥善地安排了潘双全的职务，并保证他有职有权之后，又继续帮助他解决在工作过程中发生的各种问题，改造他的思想作风。潘双全过去一贯是用打、骂、罚的办法管理工人的，在他担任第二副厂长后不久，他在管理生产中又独断专行起来，这引起了工人的很大不满。
    这种资本主义经营管理作风，已经影响着企业管理的改进。这时，厂的党支部书记和公股厂长（党员）便和潘双全进行了谈话，对他管理生产上的积极表现作了表扬和鼓励，同时，严肃地指出了他工作中的缺点，告诉他在新企业里管理生产一定要相信群众，依靠群众，有事和群众商量。为了帮助潘双全认识和克服他的资本主义思想，党组织就启发和引导他在实际工作中去认识工人群众的力量，克服他轻视工人，不依靠工人的错误思想。去年第三季度，厂里开展了全面节约运动，成立了四个以提高质量为中心的节约小组，党支部和公股厂长便让他参加了小组的领导工作。在这个小组里，他每天接触着大量来自工人群众的各种合理化建议，听到了许多工人提高生产的生动事迹，例如，当时他和工人们争吵不休的先进加煤操作法，现在工人们主动在执行了，加煤工人周炳忠进一步改进了加煤操作法后，不但减低了耗煤量，而且提高了煤炭的火力。在这些事实的面前，他逐渐认识到自己过去轻视工人的智慧是错误的。久新搪瓷厂党支部在帮助潘双全克服资本主义思想的同时，也对工人们进行了团结、改造资本家的教育，要工人们尊重潘双全的行政职务，支持和贯彻他提出的有利于生产的措施。这样，潘双全和工人们的关系便逐渐地改善，吵闹的事情几乎绝迹了。
    这时潘双全在工作中又被另一个苦恼折磨着，就是不识字。不识字在过去还可以对付，在今天的新企业里，困难越来越大了。学习上由于不能读书看报，听报告也不能作笔记，就影响着他在政治上的进步。工作上他连车间的统计报表也看不懂，各种来往公文又要他签字盖章，这使他又是着急，又是悲观。党支部一方面安慰和鼓励他，一方面就建议行政上指定专人给他帮助。当潘双全到上级机关出席重要的会议需要作记录的时候，工厂便派专人帮助他做笔记，在批阅各种公文时，便指定专人把文件的内容详细念给他听，让他心中有数。厂内组织读报时，总是请潘双全参加，有时候，请人专门读给他听，将报纸上公布的各种重要政策问题解释给他听，帮助他了解当前的国内外的时事。为了从根本上解决这个问题，党支部又鼓励他从头学习文化，就在党支部的热情鼓励下，53岁的潘双全，终于进了本厂的工人文化业余学校，开始了学习生活，他每星期有三天晚上在学校和工人们一起上课，平时则在每天中午温课和习字，学习得非常努力。他说：“到社会主义社会不识字可不行，我要到社会主义，我决心学会它。”在党支部的不断鼓励和帮助之下，经过几个月的刻苦学习，潘双全已能看一般的信件和写普通的便条了。这使得潘双全对自己的前途更加乐观了，积极性也更加提高了。
    久新搪瓷厂党支部对潘双全的进步表现，都及时地给予表扬。去年，厂里有两种产品——34公分的单奶面盆和30公分的花茶盆子——发生了麻黑点的质量事故，一直不能解决，潘双全研究出了一些办法，把质量提高到95％左右，接着工人们在这一改进的基础上又进一步改进了操作方法，质量达到了百分之百。事后，公股厂长对他积极改进质量的事迹进行了表扬，并要他从这件事情中吸取教训，在今后的工作中更好地依靠工人，接受工人群众的帮助。厂的党支部和公股代表对潘双全在工作中暴露出来的缺点和错误，也采取诚恳的态度给他帮助，引导他进行自我批评。最近，研究改进一种产品的质量问题时，潘双全自恃有技术，看不起工程师，和工程师吵闹起来，会后支部书记和公股代表就对他严肃而诚恳的进行了批评，给他作了分析。以后，潘双全就主动找工程师作了自我批评，承认了自己的缺点。这样，潘双全也逐渐习惯了批评和自我批评，更加靠拢了党支部。
    使潘双全深深感动的是，工厂合营一年后各方面都焕然一新，企业很快就由亏损而变为盈余。产量不断增加，质量也在不断提高，从去年8月份起，已经消灭了退货现象。
    久新搪瓷厂党支部对潘双全在劳动中的贡献，同样给予应得的荣誉，2月8日厂里评选先进工作者的时候，潘双全和工人们一起得到了奖励和表扬，这使潘双全又一次获得了鼓舞。他坚决表示一定要逐步放弃剥削，克服自己的资本主义思想，把自己改造成为一个自食其力的劳动者，来回答党和工人群众对他的教育。
