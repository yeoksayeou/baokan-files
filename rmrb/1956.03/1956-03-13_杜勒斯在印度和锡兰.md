Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 11th: After a two-day visit in India, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles left New Delhi on the night of March 10th for Colombo, Ceylon.

Dulles held several talks with Indian Prime Minister Nehru, totaling about 6 hours. According to Dulles' announcement at a press conference held on the 10th before his departure, he and Nehru "comprehensively studied the world situation, with particular emphasis on issues of common concern to India and the United States." He said that the talks had enabled him to better understand India's attitude, and "I hope Nehru will be able to better understand our attitude." Dulles also said that he was not considering any changes to the United States' policy towards India.

The "Hindustan Standard" said that the talks did not bring the two countries closer on the two issues most important to India—Goa and Kashmir. The newspaper pointed out that Dulles had not changed his attitude on either issue.

At the press conference, most of the questions reporters raised to Dulles concerned U.S. policy on Goa and Kashmir, and U.S. military aid to Pakistan. Reuters reported that on the Kashmir and Goa issues, which "most infuriated Indian public opinion" against the United States, "Dulles failed to satisfy Indian public opinion."

At the press conference, Dulles also attempted to interfere with the Chinese people's sacred right to liberate Taiwan. He said, "We are trying to reach an agreement not to use force. But we have not made as much progress as we had hoped." Dulles also attempted to cover up the United States' detention of overseas Chinese in the United States. He insisted that "no Chinese in the United States wants to go to mainland China."

The press conference ended in silence.

Xinhua News Agency, March 12th: Colombo dispatch: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles arrived in Colombo, the capital of Ceylon, from New Delhi on March 11th for a one-day visit, and left Colombo that night for Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.

In Colombo, Dulles held talks with Ceylon's Governor-General Goonetilleke and Ceylon's Prime Minister Kotelawala.

At a press conference held after the talks, Dulles said that he and the Ceylonese leaders discussed issues concerning the entire world and issues of major concern to both the United States and Ceylon. He expressed his unwillingness to discuss the details of the talks.

As the public in Asia increasingly opposed the United States' policy of establishing military blocs, Dulles tried his best at the press conference to defend this unpopular U.S. policy, and boasted about U.S. so-called economic "aid." He also slandered and smeared the Soviet Union in an attempt to dilute the growing influence in Asian countries of the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy and its policy of providing economic and technical assistance to backward countries without any conditions attached.

    杜勒斯在印度和锡兰
    据新华社新德里11日电　美国国务卿杜勒斯在印度活动两天后，在3月10日夜里离开新德里前往锡兰的科伦坡。
    杜勒斯曾经同印度总理尼赫鲁举行了共约6小时的几次会谈。据杜勒斯临走以前在10日举行的记者招待会上宣布，他和尼赫鲁在会谈中“全面地研究了世界局势，特别着重在印度和美国共同有关的问题上”。他说，这次会谈已经使他自己更好地了解印度的态度，而且“我希望尼赫鲁能够更好地了解我们的态度。”杜勒斯还说，他并没有考虑美国对印度的政策要有任何改变。
      “印度斯坦旗报”说，这次会谈没有使得两国在印度心目中最重要的两个问题——果阿和克什米尔问题——上的意见有所接近。这家报纸指出，杜勒斯在这两个问题上都没有改变他的态度。
    在记者招待会上，记者们向杜勒斯提出的大多数问题是有关美国对果阿和克什米尔的政策以及美国给予巴基斯坦军事援助等问题。路透社记者报道说，在美国“最使印度舆论感到愤慨”的克什米尔和果阿问题上，“杜勒斯都未能使印度舆论感到满意”。
    杜勒斯在记者招待会上还企图干涉中国人民解放台湾的神圣权利。他说，“我们正在设法取得不使用武力的协议。但是没有获得像我们所希望的那样多的进展。”杜勒斯并且企图掩饰美国扣留旅美华侨的行为。他硬说“在美国的中国人没有人希望到中国大陆去。”
    记者招待会最后在全场沉默的情况下结束。
    新华社12日讯　科伦坡消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯3月11日从新德里到达锡兰首都科伦坡进行了一天的活动，并且在当天夜里离开科伦坡前往印度尼西亚首都雅加达。
    在科伦坡，杜勒斯同锡兰总督古涅狄莱克和锡兰总理科特拉瓦拉举行了会谈。
    杜勒斯在会谈后举行的记者招待会上说，他同锡兰领袖们讨论了有关全世界的问题以及对美国和锡兰两国有主要关系的问题。他表示不愿意谈论这次会谈的情况。
    由于美国建立军事集团的政策遭到亚洲公众的日益高涨的反对，杜勒斯在记者招待会上竭力为美国这种不得人心的政策辩护，并且为美国的所谓经济“援助”吹嘘。他还对苏联进行诽谤中伤，企图冲淡苏联和平外交政策和不附带任何条件地给予落后国家以经济和技术援助的政策在亚洲国家中发生的越来越大的影响。
