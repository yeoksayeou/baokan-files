In Memory of the Outstanding Scientist Irène Joliot-Curie
Wang Ganchang, Deputy Director of the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences

The untimely death of Irène Joliot-Curie, a distinguished contemporary nuclear physicist and radiochemist, and a renowned social activist, is a great loss. Because of her immense scientific contributions and her active participation in the movement to use atomic energy solely for peaceful purposes, scientists and the general public around the world feel deep sorrow and mourn her passing.

As we all know, the discovery of atomic energy ushered humanity into a new era—the atomic age. But this great discovery was guided by the foundations laid by scientists in nuclear physics, and Irène Joliot-Curie participated in almost every important stage of this foundational work, and she derived the main results.

As early as 1930, Bothe and others in Germany discovered that when beryllium, carbon, and other light atomic nuclei were bombarded with α-rays emitted by polonium, a highly penetrating radiation was released. This phenomenon immediately attracted the attention of Irène Joliot-Curie and her husband, Frédéric Joliot-Curie, and they carefully studied this problem with other instruments, discovering that when this new and strange radiation entered paraffin, it could impart considerable kinetic energy to the hydrogen nuclei (i.e., protons) within the paraffin, causing them to be ejected. This important discovery gave Chadwick in England a significant inspiration, enabling him to discover the neutron shortly thereafter, which led to a more accurate understanding of the structure of the atomic nucleus. (After Chadwick's report was published, the Soviet physicist Ivanenko immediately and correctly pointed out that the atomic nucleus contains protons and neutrons). From that time on, mankind knew that there was a powerful weapon that could transform the atomic nucleus—the neutron, which led to a leap in the research of nuclear physics. The discovery and utilization of atomic energy became possible.

In 1933, shortly after the positron was discovered in cosmic rays, the Joliot-Curies used γ-rays (which were considered to have very high energy at that time) to bombard lead sheets, discovering that positive and negative electron pairs were produced. This was the first experimental proof that γ-rays could be converted into positive and negative electron pairs through the atomic nucleus, providing new material for physicists to understand the interaction between electromagnetic fields and matter.

Irène Joliot-Curie's most significant achievement in her life should be the discovery of artificial radioactivity by her and her husband. Because of this discovery, the widespread application of radioactive isotopes—one of the two major directions of the peaceful use of atomic energy—became possible. In 1934, they continued the experiment of bombarding atomic nuclei with α-rays from polonium, as mentioned above, but this time they used aluminum as the target for the α-rays. They discovered that positive electrons were emitted from the aluminum target during the bombardment, and then they discovered—and this discovery was the most crucial—that positive electrons could still be observed being emitted from the aluminum target even after the polonium was removed. They guessed that the atomic nuclei of aluminum were affected by the α-rays and became new atomic nuclei with radioactivity. Due to Irène Joliot-Curie's rich chemical knowledge, she tried to separate the radioactive substance that could emit positive electrons from the surrounding aluminum atoms—which were presumably unaffected by the α-rays—using chemical methods. She succeeded and proved that the radioactive substance was phosphorus. It turned out that, as they had guessed, when α-particles (i.e., the nuclei of helium) entered the aluminum atomic nucleus, they merged together and immediately released a neutron, becoming a new unstable phosphorus atomic nucleus. This unstable phosphorus atomic nucleus was radioactive. After emitting a positive electron, it became a stable silicon atomic nucleus. The whole process was like this. "This is the first and final determination that certain atomic nuclei can be made radioactive by external causes. This property can even be maintained for a measurable period of time after the cause that triggered it is removed." This is the summary made by Irène Joliot-Curie and her husband of the essence of their discovery. (Published in the "Proceedings of the French Academy of Sciences" on January 15, 1934.) Since the publication of this discovery, scientists from various places have bombarded all elements existing in nature with various "shells" (the most effective of which is the neutron) and have obtained nearly a thousand kinds of isotopes to date. Since then, the infinitely broad and brilliant path of radioactive isotope applications has been opened up, which will bring infinite happiness to mankind.

As mentioned above, the utilization of atomic energy is believed to be due to the discovery of uranium fission. The main work leading to this discovery was completed by Irène Joliot-Curie. Between 1937 and 1938, she and her students discovered, through a large amount of meticulous work, that many kinds of radioactive isotopes were produced after uranium atomic nuclei were bombarded with neutrons. One of them had chemical properties similar to lanthanum, and its radioactive half-life was 3.5 hours. Based on this result, the German Hahn conducted further research and realized the phenomenon of uranium fission after absorbing neutrons.

The above achievements are Irène Joliot-Curie's main achievements, but not all of her achievements. She also has many works in radiochemistry and nuclear physics, some of which are excellent textbooks. In fact, she is not only an outstanding scientist but also a very good educator. Since she inherited her mother, the famous scientist and discoverer of radium, Maria Skłodowska-Curie, as the instructor at the University of Paris and the leader of the Curie Laboratory of the Radium Institute in Paris, she has cultivated many scientists (French and foreign). The famous Chinese scientists Qian Sanqiang, He Zehui, Yang Chengzong, and others have also received very good training from her and her husband.

Irène Joliot-Curie was also a patriot and a famous social activist. During the period when France was occupied by the Hitler gang, she actively participated in the struggle to defend her motherland. She strived to defend world peace, especially dedicated to ensuring that atomic energy was only used for peaceful purposes. She did not want this great discovery of atomic energy to be used as a tool for aggression and blackmail by a few monopoly capitalists. This upright and resolute attitude of hers was, of course, not liked by the imperialists and their lackeys. Once, when she was invited to the United States for a certain gathering, the American authorities refused to allow her to land. From this, it can be seen how the imperialists hated the scientists and peace fighters who were loved and respected by the people!

We express our great admiration for Irène Joliot-Curie's great contributions to science and her role in the cause of peace, and we learn from her the spirit of loving science and striving for peace. Now that she has passed away, we deeply mourn her and will inherit her cause and strive tirelessly for science and peace.

    悼念杰出的科学家伊·约里奥—居里
    中国科学院物理研究所副所长  王淦昌
    当代杰出的原子核物理学家和放射化学家、著名的社会活动家伊伦·约里奥—居里不幸过早地逝世了。由于她在科学上的巨大的贡献，和她的积极参加为原子能只用于和平事业的运动，使全世界的科学工作者和广大人民对于她的逝世，感到深切的悲痛和哀悼。
    大家都知道，原子能的发现使人类转入了新的时代——原子时代。但引导这个伟大的发现是由于科学家们为原子核物理奠定了基础的缘故，而这些奠定基础工作的每一个重要阶段，伊伦·约里奥—居里几乎都参加了，并且由她得出了主要结果。
    早在1930年，德国人波德等发现当由钋放出的?射线轰击铍、碳等一类的轻原子核时，有一种穿透力极大的射线放出来。这现象立刻引起了伊伦·约里奥—居里和她的丈夫弗雷德里克·约里奥—居里的注意，他们很仔细地用别种仪器来研究这个问题，发现当此种新的奇怪的射线射入石腊时还能使石腊内的氢原子核（即质子）获得相当大的动能而射出。这个重要的发现给了英国人夏得维克以重大的启示，使他不久后发现了中子，从而使人们对于原子核的构造，开始有了比较正确的认识，（夏德维克报告发表后，苏联物理学家伊万宁柯马上就正确地指出原子核是含有质子和中子的）。从那时起，人类才知道有一种可以使原子核转变的有力武器——中子，从而使原子核物理的研究，得到飞跃的进展。而原子能的被发现和利用，才成为可能。
    1933年，当正电子在宇宙线中被发现不久，约里奥—居里夫妇用（那时期认为能量很高的）γ-射线射至铅片上，发现有正负电子偶产生，这是第一次被实验证明了γ-射线可以通过原子核而转化为正负电子偶，为物理学家了解电磁场与物质的相互作用，提供了新的材料。
    伊伦·约里奥—居里一生最巨大的功绩，应当是她和她丈夫的人工放射性的发现。由于这个发现，原子能和平利用两大方向之一——放射性同位素——的广泛应用，才成为可能。一九三四年，他们继续了用上面谈过的钋的?射线轰击原子核的实验，不过这次是用铝做?射线的靶。他们发现轰击时有正电子由铝靶射出，随后他们又发现——而这次的发现是最关键性的——当钋移开后，仍可以观察到正电子由铝靶放出。她们猜想这是铝的原子核受?射线的作用，而成为新的并且具有放射性的原子核。由于伊伦·约里奥—居里的丰富的化学知识，她尝试用化学方法把能放正电子的放射体与周围的——想来是未被?射线所影响的——铝原子分离开来，结果成功了，并且证明这个放射体是磷。原来，确如他们所猜想的，当?粒子（即氦的原子核）射入铝原子核时，它们合并在一起立即放出一个中子，而成为一个新的不稳定的磷原子核。这不稳定的磷原子核具有放射性。经放出一个正电子后才变成稳定的矽原子核。整个过程就是如此。“这是第一次也是最后地确定了可以用外在原因使某些原子核具有放射性。这性能甚至在激起它的原因除去后，还能够保持可以测得出来的一段时间”，这就是伊伦·约里奥—居里和她的丈夫对他们的发现的实质所作出的概述。（发表在1934年1月15日的“法国科学院院报”上。）自从这个发现公布以后，各地科学家们用各种各样的“炮弹”（其中最有效的“炮弹”是中子）轰击了一切在自然界存在的元素而得到现在为止近一千种的同位素，从此开辟了放射性同位素应用的无限广阔的灿烂途径，并且将为人类带来无限的幸福。
    上面已经提到，利用原子能的被认为可能是由于铀分裂的发现。而导致这个发现的主要工作是由伊伦·约里奥—居里完成的。在一九三七—一九三八年中间，她和她的学生们经过大量的细致的工作，发现了当中子轰击铀原子核后，有很多种放射性同位素产生。其中一种的化学性质很像镧，它的放射半蜕期是3.5小时。德国人哈恩根据这个结果作了进一步的研究，才认识到了铀吸收中子后的分裂现象。
    上述这些成就，是伊伦·约里奥—居里的主要成就，但不是她的全部成就，她还有很多在放射化学和原子核物理方面的著作，其中一部分是很好的教科书。实际上她不独是一位杰出的科学家，而也是一位非常好的教育家。自从她继承了她的母亲著名科学家、镭的发现者玛丽亚·居里—斯克洛多夫斯卡执教巴黎大学和领导巴黎镭学研究所居里实验室以来，她培养成了很多科学家（法国的和别国的）。我国著名科学家钱三强、何泽慧、杨承宗等也都受到她和她丈夫的很好的培养。
    伊伦·约里奥—居里也是一位爱国者和著名的社会活动家，在法国被希特勒匪帮占领时期，她积极地参加了保卫祖国的斗争。她努力于捍卫世界和平，特别致力于使原子能只用于和平目的，她不愿原子能这个伟大的发现被当作少数垄断资本家侵略和讹诈的工具。她这种正直的坚决的态度，当然是帝国主义者和他们的走狗们所不喜欢的，有一次因某种集会而被邀赴美国时，美国当局竟不让她登陆。由此可见帝国主义者是如何仇视人民所喜欢爱戴的科学家及和平战士！
    我们对于伊伦·约里奥—居里在科学上的巨大贡献，在和平事业中起的作用，都表示非常的钦佩，并向她学习热爱科学和为和平而奋斗的精神。现在她去世了，我们深切的哀悼她，并将继承她的事业，为科学为和平而奋斗不懈。
