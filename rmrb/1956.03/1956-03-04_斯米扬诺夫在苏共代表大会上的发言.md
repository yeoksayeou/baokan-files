    ?斯米扬诺夫's Speech at the CPSU Congress
    Comrades! Judging from the tasks put forward to the Soviet state in the summary report of the CPSU Central Committee made by Comrade N.S. Khrushchev, the role of science is becoming more and more diversified and important. Science should play its role in raising the technology and economy of the Soviet national economy and health care to a higher level than that of the most developed capitalist countries.
    To this end, we must strengthen our science in terms of quality and quantity. The characteristic of socialism is that it must rely on the most advanced science, whether in the social system or in social production. From the earliest years of the establishment of Soviet power, after suffering war damage and during the most difficult period of the civil war, V.I. Lenin, the founder of the Soviet state, took decisive steps to improve the science of the motherland. Many large-scale scientific research institutes were established. The results of these measures continue to have a huge and positive impact; our industry owes much to these measures.
    In the period between the 19th and 20th Congresses of the CPSU, the Party and the government did a great deal of work to further develop science and consolidate its material foundation. Many new scientific research institutes have emerged, and these institutes are equipped with the latest technology, sometimes unique in the world, such as the Institute of Nuclear Problems of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the Electrophysics Laboratory, and so on.
    Equally important is the growth of scientific cadres. The most important achievement of the Soviet regime, as considered by such "sympathizers" as Winston Churchill, and the most unpleasant thing for him, is the rapid growth rate of scientific and technological cadres among our intellectuals, which far exceeds that of the United States and Britain.
    The number of scientific workers in the Academy of Sciences almost doubled during the Fifth Five-Year Plan. At the same time, it is of great significance that we are growing up relying on young people who have received good education in universities and research institutes. The work of young people proves that they have lived up to this training. Among the young people, there are doctors, corresponding members of the Academy of Sciences, and even academicians. The average age of scientific workers at the Soviet Academy of Sciences has dropped from 41 to 38 years old. Some of the main institutes of the Academy of Sciences have actually become gardens for young people, with 50% to 85% of the scientific workers being under the age of 30. In the past five years, the proportion of CYL members in the total number of scientific workers at the Soviet Academy of Sciences has increased tenfold. Party members account for 42% of scientific workers with degrees, 34.4% of academicians, and 41.5% of corresponding members. The scientific activities carried out by the Soviet army of scientific workers, both in theoretical aspects and in the practical application of theory, have achieved results.
    However, in the scientific activities of the Soviet Union, especially in the work of the Academy of Sciences, both in the natural sciences and technical sciences, and in the extremely important field of social sciences, there are many faults and shortcomings. In the speeches of Comrades Kirichenko, Shepilov, Suslov, and Mikoyan, the work of economists, historians, and jurists - these scientists - was correctly criticized. I want to assure the Congress that the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences will not ignore this fair criticism and will draw the necessary conclusions.
    However, please allow me to also cite some examples of the good results of Soviet scientific work directly related to the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
    Achievements in atomic energy and the peaceful use of atomic energy in recent years are the most significant achievements. It must be pointed out that what is referred to here is not a certain discovery or an explanation of a mystery, as laymen often imagine, but the most significant and well-organized rapid progress made by the entire scientific front in this field of science. This scientific field is currently recognized as the leader in the natural sciences.
    The reason why this undertaking could be organized in a short period of time is that the Soviet Academy of Sciences had already done work in the fields of radioactive cosmic rays and nuclear phenomena. Therefore, there were some "scientific reserves" and cadres, which made it possible to carry out this undertaking. The achievement of success relied on the utilization of all the treasures of the new physics and the use of the basic theories of modern physics - the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics - in research methods. This unprecedented progress on the scientific front contains many discoveries, especially some discoveries like the principle of building charged particle accelerators that can enable particles to reach huge energies of true cosmic ray levels - 10 billion electron volts, which was studied by the Academy of Sciences, as well as other equally important discoveries.
    Although atomic power engineering is still only in the experimental stage of utilization, in the Sixth Five-Year Plan, it will have a power capacity more than twice that of all the power stations in Tsarist Russia. In the future, methods of controlling thermonuclear reactions will be mastered, so that it can be hoped that the reactions produced in hydrogen bombs and similar reactions can provide power for peaceful purposes.
    As a byproduct of the entire process of this great work, there has been successful research on the application of isotopes - newly produced elements in the atomic industry - to oil well core sampling, the exploration of other useful mineral deposits, gamma-ray flaw detection of metal products and structures, health care, and the determination and control of the mysteries of organism life activities. For example, the germination period of potatoes can be delayed by several months, or conversely, it can be accelerated by gamma-ray irradiation.
    In the mid-1920s to 1930s, solid-state physics, as an abstract science, underwent almost unprecedented development. However, this development later led to the creation of semiconductor radio engineering instruments, thermoelectric generators, Rochelle salt crystal piezoelectric instruments, and photoelectric instruments. These instruments mark a new step in technological progress, and currently they have a revolutionary impact on modern communication technology, automation technology, computers and control machine technology, and it can be said that they have a revolutionary impact on every department of new technology.
    The results of research on the thermoelectric properties of semiconductors have opened up rich possibilities for dynamics, especially in the direct conversion of heat energy into electrical energy. It can be believed that the time when the heat and light of the desert can be directly converted into electrical energy is not far away.
    There is no doubt that the initiative of the Academy of Sciences is very important in establishing fast electronic computing devices and designing the type of machine with the fastest computing speed currently. Now, the Academy of Sciences is working together with the Ministry of Instrument Manufacturing and Automation Tools to create more perfect and faster machines. These machines are opening up a new era of science and technology. The digital machines of the Academy of Sciences - fast electronic computers - replace the labor of tens of thousands of calculators and solve calculation tasks that could not be solved before. Although this type of machine is specialized, it is necessary to use it extensively to help with planning, statistics, reporting, and production work. The economic effect of this machine will be immeasurably large. This type of small machine will be widely used in the automation of production processes. The first steps have been taken in using this machine to automatically translate one language into another. Mathematicians at the Academy of Sciences have completed a huge amount of work in the entire field mentioned above, and it can be said that they have rebuilt certain departments of science to adapt them to the requirements of machine mathematics. The automation of certain types of mental labor - this is the significant and fundamentally new thing that these machines bring.
    Chemists have conducted fruitful work in the technology of preparing nuclear fuel and the chemistry of artificial transuranic elements.
    As an example of a rapidly developing scientific department, we can also cite the chemistry of element-organic compounds. These element-organic compounds are organic derivatives of various different elements in Mendeleev's periodic table - various metals, fluorine, phosphorus, silicon, etc. Not long ago, this was a little-known branch of science that only a small number of scientific experts were interested in. And now, these things are products produced in tons.
    Based on in-depth chemical research on phosphorus, scientists have found some new and most effective chemical poisons, which can greatly reduce the loss of cotton, wheat, and other crop yields.
    Some new methods for obtaining high-quality fibers have been successfully researched, such as the new "庚 type fiber", excellent tougheners, precious organic acids, and so on.
    In the new silicon organic insulating materials, lubricants, and rubber, the characteristics of that inorganic molecular crystal framework, which is the framework of rock structure, and the special combination of organic lattices were discovered. As a result, a whole large batch of substances with very valuable properties for new technology was discovered.
    The work I have talked about was all completed not long ago, and looking to the future, their economic effects will basically be seen later. Looking back at the road we have traveled, we can also cite the following work done by the Academy of Sciences that has already received economic benefits. In the 1920s and 1930s and in the years since then, on the basis of scientifically sound geological predictions, the Academy of Sciences expedition, led by Academician Fersman, completed the survey of the vast area of the Khibiny Mountains on the Kola Peninsula, which was barren at the time. Some of the world's largest apatite-nepheline deposits were discovered. A new apatite industry was established on these bases, guaranteeing the production of three-quarters of our country's phosphate fertilizer. It was in those years that, due to the predictions of the Academy of Sciences, the richest nickel deposits were discovered in Monchetondel. New cities - Kirovsk and Monchegorsk - sprang up. Due to these and other discoveries, the face of the former barren land has changed beyond recognition.
    The theoretical synthesis and scientific prediction made by scientists and experts headed by Academician Gubkin played a role that everyone knows in the discovery of the richest oil region in the Volga-Ural region, known as "Second Baku". This oil region has now become the main oil production area in the Soviet Union.
    In the huge work completed by geologists at the Academy of Sciences in collaboration with the Ministry of Geology and the Ministry of Coal Industry in recent years, we can cite the following examples: the compilation of coal reserve forecasting maps for the Soviet Union and the geological structure map of the Soviet Union, and the recent discovery of the largest deposits of rare elements, boron, non-ferrous metals, and rare metals in various regions of the Soviet Union. Hydrogeochemical methods for exploring uranium mines have been developed by geologists. Relying on this method, some new uranium deposits have been discovered in the Soviet Union, and the foundation has been laid for new exploration methods for other elements, including copper, molybdenum, and lead.
    It is also impossible not to mention the role played by the scientific synthesis in demonstrating the solution of certain important national economic problems (for example, how to use the iron ore of Olenegorsk and the coking coal of Pechora to establish the metallurgical industry in the Northwest region; the proposal to establish a new metallurgical joint factory in South Yakutia relying on the coal of South Yakutia and the iron ore of Aldan).
    The Academy of Sciences has also solved many local practical application problems, some of which have significant economic significance and some of which have less economic significance. However, the work of the Academy of Sciences should not be evaluated by the results with local practical application significance. The basic task of the Academy of Sciences should be to discover and study new phenomena in nature and society, determine and synthesize the regular connections between various phenomena, and use them to serve socialist society and its production. It must be pointed out that the Academy of Sciences has not completed this main task nearly enough. This is a major obligation to the country.
    The discovery of new phenomena often brings countless consequences for technological progress. The result of Ampere's discovery of the magnetic nature of electric current was that the world had electric motors; the Curies' discovery of radioactive phenomena and Mendeleev's discovery of the periodic law of elements are such examples. The economic effects of such great discoveries are very large, and they have revolutionized vast areas of life and production.
    When our technology and science were still behind advanced capitalist countries, we could only use foreign technological achievements or adopt the discoveries of natural phenomena and natural laws by foreign scientists to develop our own technology. As our technology and science step into an advanced position, we can completely rely on ourselves, rely on our own "scientific reserves".
    Therefore, in the Sixth Five-Year Plan, we must begin to vigorously develop theoretical science, or call it basic science, first of all, scientific departments such as physics, mathematics, chemistry, and biology. They should illuminate the path to the future of new technologies and production that are not yet known to us. The main task of the scientific community, especially the Academy of Sciences, lies in this aspect. Unfortunately, this is not always understood by people. Even the "People's Daily" editorial on science on February 6th did not fully point out the importance of theory and the need to improve the role of theory.
    Let me give two examples of not correctly understanding the tasks of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. The Soviet Ministry of Trade requested the Academy of Sciences to install an automatic device for the door of the "Prague" Hotel, on the grounds that "it is hoped that the door of the hotel can automatically open as guests approach." (Laughter) Here is another example. In January of this year, a letter was received from the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation, requesting that the following scientific work be included in the 1956 work plan of the Soviet Academy of Sciences: "Select a new variety of steel for making pen nibs that does not rust in ink and air and is durable when writing."
    If the role of the Soviet Academy of Sciences is understood in this way, then it is not difficult to imagine what kind of local tasks the Academies of Sciences of the various republics will often be filled with!
    Without vigorously developing science and expanding the research of scientific theories, we cannot guarantee the necessary and constant technological progress. However, the development of science, including the development of theoretical science, should not be limited to Moscow and Leningrad, and a few large cities. German science was developed by universities and factory laboratories in many cities. American science relies on universities and research institutes in many cities.
    Comrade Khrushchev very correctly pointed out the abnormal phenomenon of scientific organs being concentrated in Moscow. It is necessary to move out some scientific research institutes, that is to say, to make them closer to the nature they are studying. However, it is equally important to improve the role of existing local scientific organs - universities, branches and institutes of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, especially the Academies of Sciences of the various republics. The establishment of these Academies is a clear demonstration of the Party's great concern for the development of national science and culture. National scientific work cadres have grown up. However, this undertaking must continue to be promoted, and conditions must be created for the various academies so that their work can reach the level of modern science.
    I think that the Soviet State Planning Committee and the Councils of Ministers of the various republics owe a lot of debt to the various academies. For example, the Armenian Academy of Sciences, which has world-renowned scientists, has only about 500,000 rubles in scientific equipment funds each year. This is absolutely not enough. With this amount of funds, only two or three not-so-complex modern physical instruments can be purchased.
    The situation is even worse in the newly established Academies of Sciences of the Tajik, Uzbek, and Kyrgyz Republics. The construction of scientific research organs is progressing very slowly. Even the relatively large Academy of Sciences of the Kazakh Republic, which was founded 10 years ago, has not used a single new building from its founding to the present. In the Academies of Sciences of Tajik, Estonia, and many other republics, people have to borrow the houses of the Presidium to receive visiting scientific workers, and they are embarrassed to ask others to see their laboratories. The State Planning Committee and the Councils of Ministers of the various republics must re-examine their attitudes towards the development of science in the various republics.
    The 7th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU pointed out the intolerable disconnect between scientific work and the practical use of scientific achievements. I think that here, the problem is not only to fight against conservative psychology and encourage the cultivation of new things in production, but also the planning of scientific work. The conflict lies in the fact that in the case of planned development of industry, science provides unplanned new things, which are difficult to find a place to play a role for themselves. Of course, scientific discoveries cannot be prescribed by plans, but it is possible and should be planned to most rationally concentrate forces on the most promising scientific departments. On the basis of extensive scientific exploration and the acquisition of "scientific reserves", it is possible to strictly formulate nationwide plans to conduct research on a certain new technology, and these plans include its scientific part, design part, and the interrelationship between these two parts mastered by the industrial sector. Relying on certain technical adventures, that is, formulating plans to realize unfinished work, can greatly save time. The formulation of national plans for major scientific and technological issues on a national scale has now become easier because of the existence of the Soviet State Technical Committee as such an organ. The responsibility of this organ is to coordinate and guide this type of work, and the Soviet Academy of Sciences is ready to give it its full assistance.
    We have a scientific organ system, which is one of the largest scientific organ systems in the world. However, it has many historical characteristics, and we have not made rational use of it. There is no clear scientific division of labor between the scientific research organizations of the various academies, universities, and industrial departments, which has led to their improper coordination, slow progress, and duplication of work.
    The decision of the 7th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU to strengthen the work of factory laboratories enables some departmental research institutes to get rid of many trivial tasks related to serving the current production needs, so that they can concentrate their attention on solving the scientific problems with the greatest development prospects in their respective industrial departments, and this can make it possible for the Academy of Sciences to not have to spend its efforts to solve many tasks that should be solved by departmental research institutes. In this way, the Academy of Sciences can concentrate its attention together with universities to solve the most significant scientific tasks with principled significance, and to conduct scientific exploration of new, under-researched, but promising directions. I think that the Soviet scientific research organ network must be re-examined carefully so that it can adapt to the most important direction of scientific and technological progress.
    We scientific workers, like all Soviet people, are prepared to contribute all our strength, knowledge, and enthusiasm to the great cause of communist construction and the high tide of scientific and technological progress that is closely related to us. Let me assure the Congress on behalf of the scientific workers: the scientific workers will contribute all their strength to vigorously develop science, and to widely and systematically utilize the achievements of science in all departments of the national economy.
    The gratitude of the Central Committee of the CPSU expressed by Comrade Khrushchev touched and inspired the scientific workers, and this gratitude will be a powerful driving force in their tense creative work.
    Long live our great Party! (Applause)

    ?斯米扬诺夫在苏共代表大会上的发言
    同志们！从尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志所作的苏共中央委员会的总结报告给苏维埃国家提出的任务看来，科学的作用变得越来越多样化和重要了。在把苏联国民经济的技术和经济以及保健事业提高到比最发达的资本主义国家更高的水平方面，科学应当起自己的作用。
    为此，就必须从质量和数量上加强我们的科学。社会主义的特点就是，它无论在社会制度或在社会生产方面，都必须依靠最先进的科学。从苏维埃政权建立的最初年代起，在遭受战争破坏以后和国内战争的最艰苦时期，苏维埃国家的奠基人弗·伊·列宁就为提高祖国的科学采取了决定性的步骤。许多规模巨大的科学研究所建立起来了。采取这些措施的结果直到现在还有着巨大的良好的影响；我们的工业在很多方面都应当归功于这些措施。
    在苏共第十九次代表大会和第二十次代表大会之间的时期内，党和政府为进一步发展科学和巩固科学的物质基础做了许多工作。许多新的科学研究所出现了，这些研究所都是按照最新的技术装备起来的，有时还是全世界独一无二的，例如苏联科学院核子问题研究所、电物理学实验室等等就是这样的。
    同样重要的是，科学干部也成长起来了。我们的这样一些“同情者”，如温斯顿·丘吉尔所认为的苏维埃政权的最主要成就、而对他说来则是最不愉快的事情的，正是我国知识分子科学技术干部的迅速增长的速度，这种速度远远超过了美国和英国。
    科学院科学工作者的数量在第五个五年计划期间差不多增加了一倍。同时，我们是依靠在高等学校和研究院受过良好教育的青年成长起来的，这一点具有重大意义。青年们的工作证明他们没有辜负这种培养。在青年中间出现了博士、科学院通讯院士，甚至还有院士。苏联科学院科学工作者的平均年龄从四十一岁下降为三十八岁。科学院的一些主要的研究所实际上成了年轻人的园地，这些研究所的科学工作者有50％到85％是三十岁以下的人。在过去五年中，共青团员在苏联科学院科学工作者总人数中所占的比例增加到了十倍。党员在有学位的科学工作者中占42％，在院士中占34.4％，在通讯院士中占41.5％。苏联的科学工作者大军无论在理论方面和理论的实际应用方面所进行的科学活动，都取得了成绩。
    但是，在苏联的科学活动中，特别是在科学院的工作中，无论在自然科学和技术科学方面或是在社会科学的极其重要的领域内，都有着不少的过失和缺陷。在基里钦科、谢皮洛夫、苏斯洛夫、米高扬同志的发言中，正确地批评了经济学家、历史学家、法学家——这些科学家们的工作。我要向代表大会保证，苏联科学院主席团决不忽视这种公正的批评，并且要作出必要的结论。
    但是，请允许我也举一些和苏联科学院有直接关系的苏联科学工作良好成果的例子。
    近几年来在原子能和和平利用原子能方面的成绩，是最显著的成就。必须指出，这里所指的不是某一种发现或释明了一个奥秘，像外行人常常想像的那样，而是整个科学战线在科学的这个领域内所取得的最巨大的、很好地组织的迅速进展。这个科学领域目前是公认的自然科学的领袖。
    这一事业之所以能够在短期内组织起来，是因为苏联科学院在放射性宇宙线和原子核现象方面早已做了工作。因此，有了一些“科学储备”和干部，使开展这一事业成为可能。成绩的取得是依靠了利用新的物理学的全部宝藏和在研究方法上借助于现代物理学的基本理论——相对论和量子力学理论。科学战线上这种史无先例的进展包含了许多发现，特别是像科学院所研究出来的建造能使粒子达到巨大的真正宇宙线级的能量——100亿电子伏的带电粒子加速器的原理这样一些发现，以及其他一些同等重要的发现。
    尽管原子动力工程还只是处在试验性的利用阶段，但是，在第六个五年计划中它将具有比沙皇俄国全部电力站的发电能力大一倍多的功率。今后将掌握控制热核反应的方法，这样一来，可以希望使在氢弹中产生的反应以及类似的反应，能够提供出为和平目的服务的动力。
    作为这项巨大工作全部过程的副产品，是成功地研究了把同位素——原子工业新生产出来的元素——运用于油井取岩样、其他有用矿藏的勘探、金属制品和结构的丙种射线探伤、保健事业、有机体生命活动的奥秘的探明和控制。例如，可以延迟马铃薯的发芽期几个月，反之，也可以用丙种射线照射方法使它提早发芽。
    在本世纪20年代到30年代中间，固体物理学作为一门抽象科学，得到了几乎是空前的发展。然而，后来这种发展导向了创造半导体无线电工程仪器、热电发电机、酒石酸钾钠结晶体压电仪器和光电仪器。这些仪器标志着技术进展的新的一步，目前它们对现代的通讯技术、自动化技术、计算机和控制机器技术，可以说是对新技术的每个部门，都发生了革命性的影响。
    对半导体热电性质研究的结果，为动力学开辟了丰富的可能性，特别是在直接变热能为电能方面。可以相信，能够把沙漠的热和光直接变为电能的时候已经不远了。
    毫无疑问，在建立快速电子计算装置和设计目前运算速度最大的这种类型的机器方面，科学院的主动精神是非常重要的。现在，科学院同仪器制造和自动化工具部一起，为创制更完善和运算更快的机器而共同工作。这些机器开辟了科学和技术的新纪元。科学院的数字机器——快速电子计算机代替了几万个计算者的劳动，解决着以前不能解决的计算任务。这种类型的机器虽然是专门化的，但是广泛地用它们来帮助作计划、统计、报告和生产的工作却是必要的。这种机器的经济效果将是大得难以估量的。这种类型的小型机器将在生产过程的自动化方面广泛采用。在利用这种机器把一种语文自动翻译成另一种语文方面，已经跨出了头几步。科学院的数学家在上述整个领域内完成了巨大的工作，他们可以说是改建了科学的某些部门，使它们适应于机器数学的要求。某几种脑力劳动的自动化——这就是这些机器所带来的意义重大的具有原则意义的新事物。
    化学家在制备核燃料的工艺学和人工超铀元素的化学方面进行了富有成效的工作。
    作为迅速发展的科学部门的例子，还可以举出元素有机化合物化学。这种元素有机化合物即门德列耶夫元素周期表中各种不
  同的元素——各种金属、氟、磷、矽等——的有机衍生物。不久以前，这还是只有为数不多的科学专家所感到兴趣的一个很少为人知道的科学分支。而现在，这些东西已经是成吨生产的产品了。
    科学家在对磷进行深刻的化学研究的基础上，找到了一些新的效能最高的化学毒剂，用这些毒剂就能够大大减少棉花、小麦及其他农作物收成的损失。
    取得优质纤维的一些新方法已经研究成功，例如新的“庚种纤维”、优良的增韧剂、珍贵的有机酸等等。
    在新的矽有机绝缘材料、润滑剂、橡胶中，发现了作为岩石结构框架的那种无机分子晶架的特性与有机晶格的特殊组合体。结果，就发现了整整一大批对新技术有着非常可贵的特性的物
  质。
    我所谈到的工作都是不久以前完成的，展望未来，它们的经
  济效果基本上还将在以后看到。回顾一下所经历的道路，还可以
  举出科学院所做的以下一些已经收到经济效果的工作。在二十年
  代和三十年代以及此后的年代中，在有科学根据的地质预测的基
  础上，科学院考察队在费尔斯曼院士的领导下，完成了当时荒无
  人烟的科拉半岛希宾山辽阔地区的勘测。世界上最大的一些磷灰
  石—霞石产地被发现了。在这些基地上建立了新的磷灰石工业，
  保证我国四分之三的磷肥的生产。就在这些年中，由于科学院的
  预测，在蒙切通德尔发现了最丰富的镍产地。新的城市——基洛
  夫斯克和蒙切高尔斯克兴起了。由于这些和其他一些发现，以前
  的荒凉地带的面貌改变得难以辨认了。
    以古勃金院士为首的科学家和专家们所作的理论综合和科学
  预测，在号称“第二巴库”的伏尔加—乌拉尔最丰富的油区的发
  现中所起的作用，是大家都知道的。现在这个油区已经成了苏联
  的主要采油区。
    近几年来，在科学院的地质学家协同地质部和煤炭工业部所完成的巨大工作中，可以举出这样一些例子：苏联境内储煤量预报图和苏联地质构造图的绘制，最近苏联各地区的稀有元素、硼、有色金属和稀有金属最大产地的发现。探寻铀矿的水文地质化学方法已由地质学家制定出来。依靠这种方法，已经在苏联发现了一些新的铀矿产地，并且为其他元素，其中包括铜、钼、铅的新的勘测方法打下了基础。
    也不能不提一下在论证某些重要国民经济问题的解决方面 （例如，如何用奥列尼哥尔的铁矿砂和彼朝拉的焦煤来建立西北区的冶金工业；关于依靠南雅库特的煤炭和阿尔丹的铁矿砂来建立南雅库特新冶金联合工厂的建议）科学的综合所起的作用。
    科学院同时还解决了许多局部的实际应用方面的问题，这些问题有的具有重大经济意义，有的则经济意义不大。但是，不应当用具有局部的实际应用意义的成果来评定科学院的工作。科学院的基本任务应当是发现和研究自然和社会中的新现象，确定和综合各种现象之间的有规律的联系，并且利用它们来为社会主义社会和它的生产服务。必须指出，科学院对它的这个主要任务完成得远为不够。这是它对国家的一项重大义务。
    新现象的发现常常为技术进步带来数不尽的后果。像安培发现电流磁性的结果，使世界有了电动机；居里夫妇的发现放射现象，门德列耶夫的发现原素周期率，都是这样的例子。这类伟大发现的经济效果是非常大的，它们使生活和生产的广大领域起了革命性的变化。
    当我们的技术和科学还落在先进的资本主义国家后面的时候，我们只能够利用外国的技术成就或者采用外国科学家对自然现象和自然规律的发现，来发展我们自己的技术。随着我国技术和科学的踏上先进地位，我们就能够完全指靠自己，指靠自己的“科学储备”了。
    因此，在第六个五年计划中，我们必须开始大力发展理论科学，或者称它为基础科学，首先是物理数学、化学、生物学等科学部门。它们应当照明那条通向尚未为我们所知道的新技术和生产的未来的道路。科学界、首先是科学院的主要任务就在这个方面。可惜，这点并不是常常为人们所懂得。甚至在“真理报”2月6日有关科学的一篇社论中也没有充分指出理论的重要意义和提高理论的作用的必要性。
    让我举两个没有正确理解苏联科学院的任务的例子。苏联贸易部请求科学院为“布拉格”饭店的大门安装一个自动装置，理由是“希望饭店的大门能够随着客人们的走近而自动地打开。” （笑声）还有另外一个例子。今年1月接到俄罗斯联邦部长会议的一封信，要求在1956年的苏联科学院工作计划中列入这样一项科学工作：“挑选制笔尖用的一种新品种的钢，这种钢在墨水和空气中都不生锈，并且在书写时经久耐用。”
    如果是这样来理解苏联科学院的作用，那末不难设想，在各加盟共和国的科学院中会常常塞满了怎样一些局部的任务！
    不大力发展科学，不扩大科学理论的研究，我们就不能够保证必要的经常的技术进步。但是科学的发展，其中包括理论科学的发展，不应当仅限于莫斯科和列宁格勒，以及几个大城市。德国的科学是由很多城市中的大学和工厂实验室发展起来的。美国的科学依靠着许多城市的高等学校和研究所。
    赫鲁晓夫同志非常正确地指出了科学机关集中在莫斯科的不正常现象。必须迁出一些科学研究所，就是说，要使它们更加接近它们所研究的自然界。但是，同样重要的是必须提高现有的地方科学机关——高等学校、苏联科学院的分院和研究所，特别是各加盟共和国的科学院——的作用。这些科学院的设立，就是党对发展民族科学和文化的伟大关怀的明证。民族的科学工作干部已经成长起来。但是，必须继续推动这个事业，并且为各科学院创造条件，使它们的工作能够达到现代科学的水平。
    我认为苏联国家计划委员会、各加盟共和国部长会议对各个科学院欠了很多债。例如，拥有世界著名的科学家的亚美尼亚科学院，每年科学设备经费仅为50万卢布左右。这是绝对不够的。用这笔经费只能买到两三部不太复杂的现代物理仪器。
    在塔吉克、乌兹别克和吉尔吉斯共和国成立不久的科学院中，情况还要糟糕。科学研究机关的建筑工程进行得非常迟缓。甚至10年以前就创立的规模比较大的哈萨克共和国科学院，从创立起到现在都没有动用过一所新建筑物。在塔吉克、爱沙尼亚和其他许多加盟共和国的科学院里，人们不得不借用主席团的房子接待来参观的科学工作者，而不好意思请别人看自己的实验室。国家计划委员会和各加盟共和国部长会议必须重新彻底检查自己对发展各共和国科学的态度。
    苏共中央7月全会指出了在科学工作和实际利用科学成果二者之间的不能容忍的脱节现象。我认为，在这里，问题不仅是向守旧心理作斗争和鼓励在生产中培养新的事物，问题还在于科学工作的计划。抵触的地方在于：在有计划地发展工业的情况下，科学却提供了无计划地出现的新事物，这些新事物很难为自己找到发挥作用的地方。当然，科学的发现是不能够用计划来规定的，但是把力量最合理地集中在最有希望的科学部门，则是能够而且应当作出计划的。在广泛进行科学探索和取得“科学储备”的基础上，是能够严格地制定出全国范围的计划，来对某项新技术进行研究的，这些计划包括它的科学部分、设计部分和由工业部门来掌握这两部分之间的相互联系。依靠某些技术上的冒险，即对尚未完成的工作制定实现它们的计划，可以大大节省时间。制定全国规模的主要科学技术问题的国家计划，现在已经因为有了苏联国家技术委员会这样的机关而变得容易起来。这个机关的责任是调配和指导这类工作，苏联科学院已经准备给它以全力帮助。
    我们拥有一个科学机关系统，它是世界最大的科学机关系统之一。但是它有很多的历史特点，而我们却没有合理地去利用。在各个科学院、高等学校和工业部门的科学研究组织之间，没有明确的科学分工，这就造成了它们之间互相配合得不正确、工作进展速度缓慢和工作重复的现象。
    苏共中央7月全会所制定的加强工厂实验室的工作的决定，使得一些部门的研究所能够摆脱掉有关为目前生产需要服务的许多琐碎任务，从而能够集中它们的注意力来解决各自工业部门中有最大发展前途的科学问题，而这又可以使科学院不必花费力量去解决许多应由部门研究所解决的任务。这样，科学院就能够同高等学校一起集中注意力来解决最重大的、具有原则意义的科学任务，并且对新的还缺少研究的、但有很大发展前途的方向进行科学探讨。我认为，必须重新仔细检查苏联的科学研究机关网，以便使它能够适应科学和技术进步的最重要的方向。
    我们科学工作者，正像所有苏联人一样，准备为共产主义建设的伟大事业和同我们有着密切联系的科学和技术进步的高涨，贡献出全部的力量、知识和热情。让我代表科学工作者向大会保证：科学工作者将贡献出全部力量来大力发展科学、广泛地和有计划地在国民经济一切部门中利用科学的成就。
    赫鲁晓夫同志所表示的苏共中央委员会的谢意，感动并且鼓舞了科学工作者，这种谢意在他们的紧张的创造性工作中将是一个强大的推动力量。
    我们的伟大的党万岁！（掌声）
