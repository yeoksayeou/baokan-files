Xinhua News Agency, Berlin. The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany held its 26th plenary session on March 22. After hearing a report on the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Central Committee unanimously adopted a resolution approving the Political Bureau's report on the 20th Congress of the CPSU.

The resolution stated: The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany expresses its brotherly solidarity with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and endorses the discussions and resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU.

The resolutions of the 20th Party Congress have had a profound impact on peace-loving people all over the world. The Congress demonstrated that, due to the existence of the socialist world system, the possibility of the victory of peace, democracy and social progress has emerged in all countries where the masses are striving to defeat the forces of war and reaction.

The German working class should be fully aware of their shared responsibility for maintaining peace in Europe, and should understand that they now possess all the capabilities and prerequisites to defeat German militarists and bankrupt politicians of strength. To do so, a united front must be established throughout Germany, including all political parties of the working class, trade unions and all workers' organizations. The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany will do everything possible to achieve this goal, thereby helping to create an atmosphere of rapprochement and cooperation among the entire working class and peace-loving people in Germany, in order to establish a European collective security system, ease international tensions and bring the two German states closer together.

The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany welcomes the position of the Party and the Soviet Government in the report of the Central Committee of the CPSU regarding the restoration of German unity on a democratic basis. The 20th Party Congress raised the national question, which is closely related to our struggle to strengthen peace and European security. The workers and all citizens of West Germany can see from this that it is hopeless for the politicians of strength to carry out their plans for aggression and force. Recently, in West Germany, due to the profound changes in public opinion, patriotic forces have gained tremendous growth. These patriotic forces represent the opinion that the restoration of German unity on a democratic basis is impossible without the establishment of collective security for the people of Europe and the gradual rapprochement and understanding between the two German states.

    关于苏联共产党第二十次代表大会
    德国统一社会党中央委员会通过决议
    据新华社柏林讯　德国统一社会党中央委员会在三月二十二日举行第二十六次全体会议。中央委员会在听取关于苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的报告后，一致通过决议批准政治局关于苏共第二十次代表大会的报告。
    决议中说：德国统一社会党中央委员会向苏联共产党表示它和苏联共产党兄弟般的团结，并且赞同苏共第二十次代表大会的讨论和决议。
    第二十次党代表大会的决议对全世界爱好和平的人民产生了深刻的影响，代表大会表明：由于社会主义世界体系的存在，使得在群众力图击败战争和反动力量的所有国家内出现了和平民主和社会进步胜利的可能性。
    德国工人阶级应该完全意识到他们对维护欧洲和平所负的共同责任，并且应该了解到他们今天已经据有击败德国军国主义者和破产的实力政治家的一切能力和前提。这样做，就须要在全德国建立起一个包括工人阶级各政党、工会和所有工人组织的统一战线。德国统一社会党中央委员会将竭尽一切可能来争取这一目标的实现，从而有助于在德国全体工人阶级和爱好和平的人民中造成一种接近和合作的气氛，以便建立欧洲集体安全体系，缓和国际紧张局势和两个德意志国家的接近。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会欢迎苏共中央委员会报告中关于党和苏联政府对于在民主基础上恢复德国统一的立场。第二十次党代表大会提出了我们的同加强和平和欧洲安全斗争密切相关的民族问题。西德的工人和全体公民可以从这里认识到：实力政治家要执行他们的侵略和武力计划，是毫无希望的。最近，在西德，由于人民群众意见的深刻变化，使得那些爱国主义的力量获得巨大的增长。这些爱国力量代表着这种意见，就是：如果不建立欧洲人民的集体安全和两个德国的逐渐接近和谅解，就不可能在民主基础上恢复德国的统一。
