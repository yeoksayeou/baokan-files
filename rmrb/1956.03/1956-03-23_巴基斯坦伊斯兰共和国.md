Islamic Republic of Pakistan

Pakistan is scheduled to announce the establishment of the "Islamic Republic of Pakistan" today.

Pakistan is a new country that was born on August 14, 1947. Historically, it was originally part of the ancient civilization of India; for nearly two centuries, it suffered British colonial rule. After World War II, the national liberation movement surged unprecedentedly. When British colonialists were forced to withdraw from India, they divided the original India into two countries, India and Pakistan. The national border was mainly divided according to the religious beliefs of the residents.

The territory of Pakistan consists of two parts, one in northeastern India and one in northwestern India, separated by about 1,700 kilometers. The total area of ​​the country is more than 930,000 square kilometers, and the population is about 76 million. About 86% of the country's residents believe in Islam, but they belong to different ethnic groups. The main ethnic groups are Bengali, Punjabi, Sindhi, etc., and the languages ​​of each ethnic group are different. The capital, Karachi, is in West Pakistan and currently has a population of over 1.2 million.

After its establishment in 1947, Pakistan was a "dominion" within the British Commonwealth. The head of state was the Governor-General, appointed by the British King. In February of this year, the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan formulated Pakistan's first constitution. According to this constitution, Pakistan changed its original "dominion" status and became the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The constitution stipulates that the president must be a Muslim. On March 5, the Constituent Assembly elected the incumbent Governor-General of Pakistan, Iskander Mirza, as interim president. According to the decision of the Constituent Assembly, Pakistan will remain a member of the Commonwealth after declaring itself a republic.

Pakistan is a country with fertile land and abundant products. East Pakistan is located on the alluvial plain of the lower Ganges River, with a warm, humid and rainy climate. This part accounts for only about 15% of the country's area, but the population accounts for more than 55% of the country. West Pakistan includes most of the Indus River Basin and is relatively dry with little rain. Pakistan has rich reserves of oil, chromium, iron, natural gas and other resources.

Pakistan is famous for producing jute and cotton. Agriculture accounts for about 90% of the total value of industrial and agricultural production. The output of main grains is also close to self-sufficiency, but in recent years, due to continuous floods and droughts, a part of grain needs to be imported every year.

Due to long-term devastation by colonialists in the past, Pakistan's industrial base is very weak. In recent years, some light industries, mainly the textile industry, have developed somewhat. There are about 500,000 modern industrial workers, of which about 200,000 are factory workers, and the rest are workers in railways, shipping, and mining.

Foreign capital still has great influence in Pakistan. By 1954, British investment in Pakistan had reached more than 1.14 billion rupees, and had great influence in Pakistan's major mining, cement and sugar industries, foreign trade, shipping, banking and insurance. British capital accounts for 90% of the total investment in Pakistan's tea gardens. American capital has also been continuously entering Pakistan in recent years. Mobil Oil Company, General Motors, General Electric, Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, etc. have all established branches in Pakistan. The surplus agricultural products of the United States are also imported into Pakistan in large quantities in the form of "aid". In 1955, the United States even forced Pakistan to accept US$22.4 million worth of US "aid" cotton, even though Pakistan itself still needed to export cotton.

Pakistan's foreign trade mainly exports cotton and jute. The export value of cotton and jute accounts for more than 80% of the total export value every year. In recent years, because the United States has been suppressing the prices of raw materials produced by Southeast Asian countries on the one hand, and dumping a large amount of surplus American agricultural products to compete for the market on the other hand, Pakistan's export trade has been greatly affected.

In May 1954, Pakistan signed the "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement" with the United States, and joined the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in September of the same year. In 1955, it joined the Baghdad Pact. Participating in the US military bloc has caused Pakistan to bear heavy military expenses, and military expenditures account for a large part of the government's budget expenditures.

Together with India, Burma, Indonesia, and Ceylon, Pakistan was one of the five initiators of the Asian-African Conference held in Bandung in April 1955. That conference adopted the ten principles for promoting peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation among Asian and African countries.

Pakistan and our country have established friendly and normal diplomatic relations, and the two countries have exchanged ambassadors. China and Pakistan have signed trade agreements and are developing equal and mutually beneficial trade relations. The friendship between the people of China and Pakistan is growing day by day. In January of this year, Song Qingling, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of our country, visited Pakistan and received a warm welcome from the Pakistani government and people. The Prime Minister of Pakistan has also accepted the invitation of our government and will pay a friendly visit to our country in the near future. (Ping) (Attached pictures)

    巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国
    巴基斯坦定于今日宣布成立“巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国”。
    巴基斯坦是在1947年8月14日诞生的新国家。在历史上，它原是文明古国印度的一部分；过去将近两世纪中，曾经遭受英国的殖民统治。第二次世界大战后，民族解放运动空前高涨，英国殖民主义者被迫退出印度时，把原来的印度分为印度和巴基斯坦两国。国界主要是以居民的宗教信仰来划分的。
    巴基斯坦的领土包括两部分，一部分在印度的东北，一部分在印度的西北，中间相隔约一千七百公里。全国面积共九十三万余平方公里，人口约七千六百万。全国居民约86％信奉伊斯兰教，但属于不同的民族。主要民族有孟加拉族、旁遮普族、信德族等，各民族的语言不同。首都喀喇蚩在西巴基斯坦，现有人口120万以上。
    1947年立国后，巴基斯坦是英联邦范围内的一个“自治领”。国家元首是总督，由英王任命。今年二月，巴基斯坦制宪议会制定了巴基斯坦的第一部宪法。按照这个宪法，巴基斯坦改变原来的“自治领”地位而成为巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国。宪法规定总统必须是伊斯兰教徒。三月五日，制宪议会选出了原任巴基斯坦总督伊斯坎德尔·米尔扎为临时总统。根据制宪议会的决定，巴基斯坦在宣布为共和国以后，仍为英联邦的成员。
    巴基斯坦是土地肥沃、物产丰富的国家。东巴基斯坦位于恒河下游的冲积平原，温热多雨，这部分的面积只占全国的约15％，但人口占全国55％以上。西巴基斯坦包括印度河流域的大部分，比较干燥少雨。巴基斯坦蕴藏着丰富的石油、铬、铁、天然气等资源。
    巴基斯坦以出产黄麻和棉花闻名。农业约占工农业生产总值的90％。主要粮食的产量也接近自给，但近年因连续遇到水旱灾，每年要进口一部分粮食。
    由于过去长期遭受殖民者的摧残，巴基斯坦的工业基础很薄弱。近年来，以纺织业为主的一部分轻工业有了一些发展。现代产业工人约五十万人，其中工厂工人约二十万，其余是铁路、航运、矿山等业工人。
    外国资本在巴基斯坦还有很大势力。到1954年为止，英国在巴基斯坦的投资达11.4亿卢比以上，在巴基斯坦的主要采矿业、水泥和制糖工业、对外贸易、航运、银行和保险业等方面都有很大势力。巴基斯坦的茶园总投资中，有90％是英国资本。美国资本最近几年来也不断进入巴基斯坦。美孚油公司、美国通用汽车公司、通用电气公司、固特异橡胶轮胎公司等都已在巴基斯坦设立分公司。美国的剩余农产品也通过“援助”的形式大量输入巴基斯坦。在1955年，美国并强迫巴基斯坦接受了价值2，240万美元的美“援”棉花，虽然巴基斯坦自己还需要输出棉花。
    巴基斯坦的对外贸易以输出棉花、黄麻为主。棉、麻的出口值每年占出口总值的80％以上。最近几年，因为美国一方面压价收购东南亚国家出产的原料商品，另一方面又大量倾销美国剩余农产品来争夺市场，巴基斯坦的出口贸易受到很大影响。
    巴基斯坦在1954年5月和美国签订了“共同防御援助协定”，同年九月加入了东南亚条约组织。1955年又加入了巴格达条约。参加美国的军事集团，使巴基斯坦担负了沉重的军费，军事开支占了政府预算支出的大部分。
    和印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚、锡兰一道，巴基斯坦是1955年4月在万隆举行的亚非会议的五个发起国之一。那次会议通过了促进亚非各国和平相处、友好合作的十项原则。
    巴基斯坦和我国建立了友好的正常外交关系，两国互派大使。中巴两国曾签订贸易协定，发展着平等互利的贸易关系。中巴两国人民的友谊正在日益增进。今年一月，我国全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长宋庆龄访问了巴基斯坦，受到了巴基斯坦政府和人民热烈的欢迎。巴基斯坦总理也接受了我国政府的邀请，不久将来我国进行友好的访问。（平）（附图片）
