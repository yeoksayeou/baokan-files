    Automobile tires designed for the first batch of automobiles produced by the First Automobile Factory were trial-produced on the 10th at the Rubber Industry Testing Institute of the Ministry of Light Industry. The diameter of the tires is the same as that of common automobile tires, but the tread pattern is an off-road pattern. The advantage of this pattern is that it has strong grip and can be used on muddy or mountain roads, as well as on grasslands where there are no roads.
    This is one of the 12 types of tires for automobiles, tractors, etc. that the Rubber Industry Testing Institute plans to trial-produce this year. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    为第一汽车厂试制出汽车轮胎
    为第一汽车制造厂出产首批汽车所设计的汽车轮胎，10日已经在轻工业部橡胶工业试验所试制出来。轮胎的直径和常见的汽车轮胎一样，但是花纹是采取越野性花纹，它的好处是抓着力强，可以在泥泞或山路行驶，也可以在没有路的草原上行驶。
    这是橡胶工业试验所今年计划试制的12种汽车、拖拉机等轮胎中的一种。　（据新华社讯）
