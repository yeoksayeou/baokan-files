Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 7th dispatch from TASS: "People's Daily" published today a long article by Palmiro Togliatti discussing the question of transitioning to socialism through parliamentary means. The author emphasizes that Marxism-Leninism advocates for diverse forms of transition to socialism, and under certain conditions, revolution can develop peacefully. Togliatti writes that, when discussing parliament, the tasks and roles of parliament have undergone significant changes throughout historical development, and to understand and foresee the socialist transformations that may occur in the future, one should pay attention to these significant changes. Certain forms and means, which may have been applicable in the past when the socialist movement was not yet strong, when the bourgeoisie dominated the entire world and every country, are no longer applicable in the current conditions, when there exists a socialist camp uniting one-third of humanity, when capitalism is shaken by a general crisis, has greatly lost its past power, and when the idea of socialism and the belief in the inevitable establishment of the socialist system are increasingly spreading among the working people.

Togliatti writes that if we carefully examine parliament, we can divide it into two aspects, which, of course, are closely interconnected. On the one hand, parliament is the people's representative body, established through the expression of the will of citizens with voting rights. On the other hand, parliament is (or should be) the organ that leads the country and supervises the administrative authorities.

After a careful study of the current situation in almost all capitalist countries, or at least in those European countries where the workers' movement has developed strongly and the political situation is unstable, we will understand that the ruling bourgeois groups are becoming increasingly ambitious to disregard parliament, to not value its two aspects mentioned above, to change the nature of parliament, and even to gradually get rid of parliament.

The author continues by saying that, due to the development of the democratic movement and the emergence of mass workers' and socialist movements on the political stage, the masses have begun to obtain voting rights on a wider scale. Only after unyielding struggles, which in some countries took the form of popular uprisings against conservative governments, did the masses obtain equal, direct, and universal suffrage. However, in many countries, although the masses have obtained universal suffrage, they still do not have the possibility to have so many representatives in parliament whose numbers correspond to the actual number of voters who elected them.

Togliatti writes that, in order to prevent the masses from having an increasingly larger representation in parliament, the ruling bourgeois groups fabricate a set of electoral systems. For this purpose, they promulgate special laws that do not allow minorities to obtain seats in parliament corresponding to the number of votes they received, which is to reduce the minority to almost nothing. According to this law, parliament cannot be a political "mirror" of the country; all this is to make parliament once again a tool of conservative and reactionary bourgeois oligarchs.

Togliatti's article points out that the shameless behavior of the most reactionary groups in Italy has reached the point where, in every election, they openly declare that the electoral system must be constantly replaced and modified so that the opposition can never become the majority or have many representatives in parliament under any circumstances. This trend can be seen almost everywhere, especially in West Germany. This situation shows that the bourgeoisie itself is beginning to understand that parliament, as a tool for organizing and consolidating the capitalist system, can now become an effective tool in the hands of parties that demand the socialist transformation of society.

If all citizens enjoy the right to vote, if a fair election law based on the principle of proportional representation is implemented, and if there is a workers' and people's movement led by strong and well-organized parties, then it cannot be said under any circumstances that a majority that conforms to the will of the people will not form in parliament, thus creating favorable conditions for implementing profound social reforms and pursuing a peaceful policy.

It is quite obvious how significant the struggle of various democratic parties against attempts to falsify the electoral system is in this situation.

Togliatti then discusses the second aspect of the parliament's activities as a political leadership institution and an institution for supervising the administrative authorities. He points out the ambition of the ruling bourgeois groups and their governments to minimize the role of parliamentary debates and parliamentary resolutions as much as possible.

Togliatti summarizes: When the bourgeoisie can keep parliament in a nature representative of the oligarchy, they praise the parliamentary system. However, when opposition parties with great influence, who have proposed programs for deeply reforming the economic and social systems, enter parliament one after another based on the principle of universal suffrage and proportional distribution of parliamentary seats, the bourgeoisie adopts a skeptical and critical attitude towards parliament.

Can these forces hope to use parliament to transition to socialism, that is, to use parliament to realize these economic and social reforms? All this depends on the balance of power, first and foremost on whether the workers' party can initiate struggles and mobilize the broad masses of the people.

First, in the struggle for democratic principles, it is necessary to strive to make parliament a true "mirror" of the country, that is, to become a truly democratic parliament.

Second, it is necessary to make all parties striving for socialism, especially the Communist Party, strong, numerous, and well-organized parties, to make them good at working and fighting, and to enable them to play a decisive role among the most important strata of the working class and the people.

Third, it is necessary to make these parties consistent in their actions, because not only does the growth of their numerical advantage in parliament depend on this, but also the establishment of mutual assistance and cooperation with those political forces that do not harbor hostility towards the implementation of socialist-type social reforms and a consistent peaceful policy.

In the current situation where socialism has been victoriously affirmed and is gradually consolidated worldwide, once these conditions are met, the parliamentary path can be used to transition to socialism. From this, it can be seen that the question lies in: being able to better understand the current conditions for the struggle for socialism, being good at utilizing all the new possibilities arising from the situation, and guiding the increasingly growing mass movement onto the path that the current stage of history has unfolded before us.

    陶里亚蒂论利用议会途径过渡到社会主义的问题
    新华社讯　塔斯社莫斯科7日电：“真理报”今天刊载了帕尔米罗·陶里亚蒂写的长篇文章，谈论利用议会途径过渡到社会主义的问题。文章作者着重指出，马克思列宁主义主张向社会主义过渡的形式是多种多样的，在一定的条件下，革命是可以和平发展的。陶里亚蒂写道，谈到议会，议会的任务和它的作用，在历史发展过程中都发生了重大的变化，要了解和预见到将来可能发生的社会主义的改造，就应当注意到这些重大变化。有些形式和手段，在过去，当社会主义运动的发展还不强烈，当资产阶级独霸地统治着整个世界和每一个国家的时候可能是适用的，而在目前条件下，当世界上存在有把全人类的三分之一人口联合在一起的社会主义阵营，当资本主义为总危机所震撼，大大丧失了过去的势力，当社会主义思想和社会主义制度必然建立的信念越来越深地传播到劳动人民群众中去的时候，那些形式和手段就不适用了。
    陶里亚蒂写道，如果仔细地看一看议会，就可以把它分成两个方面，当然，这两个方面是紧密地互相联系着的。一方面，议会是人民的代议机关，这是通过有投票权的公民表达意志的方式成立的。另一方面，议会是（或是说应当是）领导国家和监督行政当局的机关。
    对差不多是所有的资本主义国家，或者说，至少是对那些工人运动已有力地发展起来而政治局势不稳定的欧洲国家的目前局势作了仔细地研究之后，我们就会明白，资产阶级统治集团是抱着越来越大的野心要忽视议会，不重视它的上述的两个方面，改变议会的本质，甚至于逐渐地摆脱掉议会。
    作者接着说，由于民主运动的发展，由于政治舞台上出现了工人的和社会主义的群众运动，人民群众才开始在比较广泛的程度上得到投票权。只有在经过不屈不挠的斗争之后，而在有些国家中这种斗争带有人民起义反对保守党派的政府的性质，人民群众才获得了平等的、直接的普遍选举权。但是，在许多国家中虽然人民群众得到了普遍选举权，而直到现在他们没有可能在议会中有这样多的代表，这些代表的人数能同选他们的选民的实际人数相适应。
    陶里亚蒂写道，资产阶级统治集团为了不让人民群众在议会中有越来越大的代表权，他们伪造出一套选举制度。为此而颁布了专门的法律，这种法律不让少数派在议会中得到相应的、与选票的数量成比例的席位，这也就是要使少数派少到几乎等于没有的程度。根据这种法律，议会不可能是国家的政治“镜子”，这一切都是为了使议会重新成为保守的和反动的资产阶级寡头政治的工具。
    陶里亚蒂的文章中指出，意大利最反动的集团所干的无耻行为已达到这种地步：在每一次选举时，他们都公开声称必须常常替换和修改选举制度，以便使反对派在任何情况下都不能成为多数或是在议会中有许多的代表。这种趋势几乎到处都可以看到，尤其是在西德。这种情况说明，就是资产阶级本身也开始懂得，作为组织和巩固资本主义制度的工具的议会，现在可以成为要求对社会进行社会主义改造的政党手中的有效的工具。
    如果全体公民都享有投票权，如果实行建立在比例原则基础上的公正的选举法，如果有由强有力的、组织完善的政党所领导的工人和人民运动，那末在任何场合下都不能说在议会里不会形成符合人民意志的多数，即为实行深刻的社会改革和执行和平政策创造有利的条件。
    十分明显，各民主党派反对企图伪造选举制度的斗争在这种情势之下具有多么重大的意义。
    陶里亚蒂谈到作为政治领导机构和对行政当局进行监督的机构的议会的活动的第二个方面。他指出资产阶级统治集团和他们的政府想尽量缩小议会辩论和议会决议的作用的野心。
    陶里亚蒂概括地写道：当资产阶级能够使议会保有代表寡头政治的性质的时候，他们是颂扬议会制度的。但是，提出了深刻地改革经济制度和社会制度的纲领的、很大势力的在野党派根据普遍选举权和议会席位按比例分配的原则纷纷进入议会，这时候，资产阶级就对议会采取了怀疑和挑剔的态度。
    这些力量是不是能指望可以利用议会来向社会主义过渡，即利用议会来实现这些经济的和社会的改革呢？这一切全要看力量的对比，首先要看工人阶级的政党是不是能发起斗争和带动广大的人民群众。
    第一，在争取民主原则的斗争中必须争取做到使议会成为国家的真正一面“镜子”，这就是说，成为真正民主的议会。
    第二，必须要使一切为社会主义而奋斗的政党、首先是共产党成为强有力的、人数众多的、组织良好的党，要使它们善于工作和斗争，能在工人阶级和人民的最重要的阶层中起有决定性的影响。
    第三，必须要使这些政党在行动上一致，因为，不仅是它们在议会的人数优势的增长上要靠这一点，就是同那些对实行社会主义类型的社会改革和对一贯的和平政策不抱敌视态度的政治力量建立互相帮助和合作方面也要靠这一点。
    在目前社会主义在全世界范围内已得到胜利地肯定和逐渐地巩固的形势下，一旦具备了这些条件，就可以利用议会的道路向社会主义过渡。由此可见，问题在于：要能更好地了解目前为社会主义而斗争的条件，要善于利用局势中产生的一切新的可能性，把日益壮大的群众运动引上现阶段的历史时期在我们面前展开的道路。
