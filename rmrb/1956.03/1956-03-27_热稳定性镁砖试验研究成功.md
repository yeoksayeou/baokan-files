    Successful Experimental Research on Thermally Stable Magnesite Bricks
    A high-grade refractory material – thermally stable magnesite bricks – experimentally researched and developed by Zhou Zong, a refractory material engineer at Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, has proven to have good results after recent trials in open-hearth steelmaking furnaces. This refractory material can withstand high temperatures above 2,000 degrees Celsius and is also not easily eroded by molten steel.

    Thermally stable magnesite brick is the latest achievement in Soviet science and technology. Because this type of magnesite brick can withstand high temperatures, it can greatly increase the temperature during steelmaking and use various new technologies to strengthen the smelting process and increase steel production. Using this type of magnesite brick can also greatly extend the life of open-hearth furnaces. According to Soviet experience, it is estimated that using thermally stable magnesite bricks to build important parts such as the roof of an open-hearth furnace will result in a lifespan approximately five times longer than using ordinary silica bricks.

    热稳定性镁砖试验研究成功
    重庆钢铁公司耐火材料工程师周宗试验研究成功的一种高级耐火材料——热稳定性镁砖，经过最近在炼钢平炉上试用证明效果良好。这种耐火材料能耐两千度以上的高温，同时不容易被钢水所侵蚀。
    热稳定性镁砖是苏联科学技术上的一项最新成就。因为这种镁砖能耐高温，在炼钢的时候就可以大大提高温度，采用各种新技术来强化冶炼过程，增加钢的产量。用这种镁砖还可以大大延长平炉的寿命。根据苏联的经验，估计采用热稳定性镁砖来修砌平炉炉顶等重要部位，比一般采用矽砖的寿命要高五倍左右。
