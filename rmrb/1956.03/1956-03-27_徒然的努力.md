    Futile Efforts
    Following the Karachi Conference, Dulles visited Asian countries such as India, Indonesia, and Japan. He chose for himself a task beyond his capabilities: to eliminate the dissatisfaction and opposition of Asian countries towards American policy and to salvage its failure in Asia.
    American news agencies have been emphasizing the importance of Dulles's trip to Asia. It is said that after Dulles's visit to these countries, the United States will determine its "new policy" towards Asia.
    After Dulles returned to the United States, he delivered a lengthy radio address of several thousand words on the 23rd. Now is the time to evaluate the success or failure of his trip and America's so-called "new policy."
    At the Karachi Conference, Dulles was keen on "putting teeth" into the Manila Treaty and openly interfering in the affairs of Asian countries, provoking disunity among them. In New Delhi and Jakarta, he immediately disguised himself as a "friend" of the Asian people. Dulles's difficulty lies in the fact that it is impossible to make the Asian people see him as a warrior "maintaining" peace and an envoy "promoting" friendship when they have not forgotten his advocacy of the "policy of strength" at the Karachi Conference, have not forgotten his talks of "brinkmanship," and have not forgotten his joint communique with the Portuguese Foreign Minister on the Goa issue.
    The public opinion and reactions of Asian countries prove that Dulles was an unwelcome "guest" in these countries. Accompanied by Dulles's disgraceful footprints, demonstrations protesting and opposing American policy broke out along his journey. He was sharply criticized by Indian public opinion on the Goa issue, and reasonable suspicion was expressed that he "actually came to India with the intention of improving Indo-American relations after attending the Karachi Conference." Indonesian newspapers pointed out that his trip to Jakarta was an attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of Asian countries and influence the composition of the new Indonesian cabinet. In Tokyo, he saw tens of thousands of Japanese people holding rallies demanding that the United States stop testing hydrogen bombs, remove American military bases, and relax the "embargo" limits on China.
    Dulles's trip provided him with an opportunity to see for himself the determination of the Asian people to safeguard national sovereignty and Asian peace. During Dulles's trip, comments such as those from India's "Delhi Times" could be heard. The publication wrote that the Indian people do not believe in the American way of handling world affairs with a "policy of strength." "Currently, the Asian people are engaged in the construction of their own countries, and they are not interested in things that would destroy this construction."
    The Asian people's strong desire to cherish independence and demand the development of a peaceful economy forced Dulles to express certain impressions and feelings, as if he were acknowledging reality. He said: The people of Asian countries "feel so proud of getting rid of the shackles of colonialism, and they are so sensitive to any signs of foreign invasion"; he admitted that Asia "many people think first of a possible invasion by the West." He said: "I did find in Asia a natural and powerful impulse to move steadily, though slowly, towards better economic and social conditions."
    However, Dulles apparently did not draw beneficial conclusions from the above impressions.
    In his radio address, Dulles still clung to the concept of the Cold War and remained infatuated with the "policy of strength," despite the disgraceful failure of this policy in Asia. He declared that the United States will "help" Asian countries expand their armaments and allow them to share the "deterrent power" of the American "mobile military force." He insisted that the Asian leaders he spoke with "without exception" all hoped that the United States would maintain a policy of strength and hoped that it was "something like an umbrella" to "cover" these countries. However, people clearly remember that Indian Prime Minister Nehru, who had spoken with Dulles, announced in his speech on March 20th that "tensions cannot be eased and peace and stability cannot be re-established by concluding military alliances and using strength against strength."
    Everyone remembers that during his visit to Ceylon, Dulles described the Manila Treaty Organization as a "fire brigade"; now, Dulles also wants to portray it as an "umbrella" to "cover other free countries." Here, Dulles deliberately ignored Nehru's speech a few days earlier condemning military treaties and advocating a change in the policy of military treaties. At the same time, he also intentionally forgot the recent remarks made by Prime Minister Sihanouk, who stated that the Kingdom of Cambodia does not want to be "protected" by the Manila Treaty Organization because Cambodia is not threatened by anyone.
    Dulles's radio address particularly emphasized that the United States will expand and improve "aid" to Asian countries. Prior to this, the US President, in a special message to Congress, requested an appropriation of more than $4.85 billion for foreign "aid" expenses.
    There is a reason why the United States has recently placed special emphasis on the issue of foreign "aid." Early on, public opinion in Asian countries pointed out that the Soviet Union's economic cooperation with India, Burma, and other countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit has posed the sharpest challenge to the US policy of using its so-called "aid" to other countries to promote neo-colonialism and promote arms expansion and war preparation.
    However, despite the challenge, the United States seems reluctant to part with its old ways in terms of so-called "aid." What kind of "aid" will the United States give to Asian countries? From Dulles's speech and the US President's special message, it can be seen that the US "aid" to Asia is still serving to promote the US war preparation policy, intensify tensions in Asia, and undermine unity among Asian countries. According to the materials provided in the message, out of the US $4.85 billion in foreign "aid" expenses, $3 billion will be used as "pure military aid," the largest part of which—$1.64 billion—will be used for Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Even with the funds allocated in the name of economic "aid," Dulles does not conceal its nakedly aggressive nature. He said that the US economic "aid" plan is "a plan to help our allies bear the cost of their defense machines—machines that greatly supplement our own defense machines." Obviously, pouring billions of dollars of military equipment to supplement the US defense machine into the Asian region will only increase the turmoil and unrest in Asia. This can only arouse stronger opposition from the Asian people to the "policy of strength."
    Dulles's trip to Asia was definitely a failure. He neither won the "favor" of the Asian people nor found a new solution to save the setbacks suffered by the "policy of strength." In the face of the Asian people who cherish peace and national sovereignty, all of Dulles's efforts to obstruct the independent development of Asian countries have been proven to be futile.

    徒然的努力
    在喀喇蚩会议之后，杜勒斯访问了印度、印度尼西亚和日本等亚洲国家。他为自己选了一件力不胜任的工作：消除亚洲国家对美国政策的不满和反对，挽救它在亚洲的失败。
    美国的通讯社一直在强调杜勒斯亚洲之行的重要性。据说，在杜勒斯访问了这些国家之后，美国将确定它对亚洲的“新政策”。
    杜勒斯回到美国之后，在二十三日发表了长达数千字的广播演说。现在，是可以为他这次旅行的成败和美国的所谓“新政策”作出评价的时候了。
    在喀喇蚩会议上，杜勒斯热衷于为马尼拉条约“装上牙齿”并公开干预亚洲国家的事务，挑拨亚洲国家的团结。在新德里和雅加达，他马上把自己打扮成是亚洲人民的“朋友”。杜勒斯的困难在于：当人们还没有忘记他在喀喇蚩会议上对“实力政策”的鼓吹，还没有忘记他的“战争边缘”政策的谈话，还没有忘记他和葡萄牙外长关于果阿问题的联合公报，而要使亚洲人民把他看成是“维护”和平的战士和“增进”友谊的使节，是决不可能的。
    亚洲各国的舆论和反应，证明杜勒斯在这些国家中是个不受欢迎的“客人”。伴随着杜勒斯的可耻的足迹，在他的旅行途中，一路上爆发了表示抗议和反对美国政策的示威游行。他在果阿问题上遭到了印度舆论尖锐的指责，并对他在参加了喀喇蚩会议之后，“居然怀着据宣布说是要改善印美两国关系的意图到印度来了”，表示了合理的怀疑。印度尼西亚的报纸指出他前去雅加达，是企图干涉亚洲国家内政，影响印度尼西亚新内阁的组成。在东京，他看到了成千成万的日本人民举行集会，要求美国停止试验氢弹，撤除美国的军事基地，放宽对中国的“禁运”限度。
    杜勒斯的旅行，为他提供了这样一个机会：使他能够亲自看到亚洲人民维护国家主权和亚洲和平的决心。在杜勒斯的旅行途中，可以听到诸如印度“德里时代”这样的评论。这个刊物写道：印度人民不相信美国以“实力政策”来处理世界事务的方式。“目前亚洲人民在从事他们本国的建设，他们对于会使这些建设遭到破坏的事情是不感兴趣的。”
    亚洲人民珍视独立和要求发展和平经济的强烈愿望，使杜勒斯不能不发表某些印象观感，好像他是在承认现实。他说：亚洲各国人民对于摆脱殖民制度的枷锁“是感到多么自豪，对于外界入侵的任何迹象他们是多么敏感”；他承认亚洲“许多人首先想的是西方的可能的入侵”。他说：“我在亚洲的确发现了一种要稳步地、虽然是缓慢地走上通往较好的经济和社会条件的道路的自然而强大的冲动。”
    但是，杜勒斯显然没有从上述的印象中得出有益的结论。
    杜勒斯在他的广播演说中，依然死抱住冷战的概念不放，依然迷恋于“实力政策”，尽管这种政策在亚洲遭到了可耻的失败。他宣称，美国将“帮助”亚洲国家扩张军备，使它们分享美国“机动军事力量的威慑力量”。他硬说同他谈过话的亚洲领袖们“毫不例外”都希望美国保持实力政策，希望那是“遮盖”这些国家的“保护伞那样的东西”。可是，人们明明记得，同杜勒斯谈过话的印度总理尼赫鲁在三月二十日的演说中宣布：“不能靠缔结军事联盟和用实力对付实力的办法来和缓紧张局势和重新建立和平和安定的”。
    大家记得，在访问锡兰的时候，杜勒斯把马尼拉条约组织说成是一个“消防队”；现在，杜勒斯还想把它也描绘成是一把“保护伞”，要用它来“遮盖其他自由国家”。在这里，杜勒斯故意不理会尼赫鲁几天前谴责军事条约，主张改变军事条约政策的演说。同时他也有意忘记了西哈努克首相在最近所发表的谈话，西哈努克表示：柬埔寨王国不希望受到马尼拉条约组织的“保护”，因为柬埔寨没有受到任何人的威胁。
    杜勒斯的广播演说，特别强调了美国将对亚洲国家扩大和改进“援助”。在此以前，美国总统向国会提出的特别咨文中，要求拨款四十八亿五千余美元作为对外“援助”的费用。
    美国最近特别强调对外“援助”问题，并不是没有原因的。很早以来，亚洲国家的舆论就已指出，苏联在平等互利基础上同印度、缅甸等国进行的经济合作，使美国利用对其他国家的所谓“援助”来推行新式殖民主义和促进扩军备战的政策，遭到了最尖锐的挑战。
    但是，尽管遭到了挑战，美国在所谓“援助”方面，看来还是舍不得它的老一套。美国将给亚洲国家以什么样的“援助”呢？从杜勒斯的演说和美国总统特别咨文中可以看出，美国对亚洲的“援助”，仍然是为推行美国的备战政策、加紧亚洲的紧张局势、破坏亚洲国家之间的团结服务的。根据咨文提供的材料，美国四十八亿五千余万美元的“援外”费用中，将有三十亿美元作为“纯军事援助”，其中最大的一部分——十六亿四千万美元——将用于亚洲、非洲和中东。即使以经济“援助”名义拨出的款项，杜勒斯也并不隐讳它的赤裸裸的侵略性质。他说，美国的经济“援助”计划，是“帮助我们的盟国担负它们的国防机器——这种机器大大地补充了我们自己的国防机器——的费用的计划”。显而易见，几十亿美元的为了补充美国国防机器的军事装备倾注到亚洲地区，将只有增加亚洲的动荡和不安。这只能引起亚洲人民对“实力政策”的更强烈的反对。
    杜勒斯的亚洲之行，肯定地是失败了。他既没有讨得亚洲人民的“好感”，也没有找出挽救“实力政策”遭受挫败的新方案。在珍视和平和国家主权的亚洲各国人民面前，杜勒斯试图阻挠亚洲国家独立发展的一切努力，都被证明是徒劳无功的。
