Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 1st. The Youth Afforestation Conference of five provinces (autonomous regions), namely Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and Henan, grandly opened this afternoon in Yan'an, the sacred revolutionary site of China.

　　The conference venue was set in the auditorium of the former Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Assembly. Today, five-star national flags and a row of red flags fluttered on the building of the auditorium. Two large gold-lettered banners hung on the left and right walls in front of the auditorium, issuing the following calls to the afforestation activists attending the conference and the youth and children of the whole country: "Young people! Green the Loess Plateau, control soil erosion, and fight against natural disasters such as water, drought, and wind and sand!" "Young people! Let's all collect seeds and cultivate seedlings, plant trees and make forests, protect forests from fire, and make the mountains and rivers of our motherland more beautiful!"

　　At 3 p.m., the venue was filled with 1,200 representatives from 25 provinces and cities across the country and the two ethnic minority autonomous regions of Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang. Among them were cadres of the Communist Youth League, outstanding forestry workers, and young activists in tree planting, forest protection, and soil and water conservation from rural areas, schools, industrial and mining enterprises, and the armed forces.

　　After the conference began, Hu Yaobang, Luo Yuchuan, Wang Huayun, Bai Zhimin, and 42 others were elected to form the presidium of the conference.

　　Zhang Shuguang, Chairman of the Conference, delivered the opening speech on behalf of the presidium. He said: "Our conference is convened under the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to green our great motherland in 12 years, and under the great plan formulated by the Party and the government to fundamentally control the harm of the Yellow River and develop the water conservancy of the Yellow River. The youth and children of the whole country are watching our conference with great interest. Before the conference, they have been welcoming the conference with practical actions of planting trees and making forests; after the conference, they will surely set off a climax of tree planting and afforestation in the five provinces (regions) and all over the country, and strive to green the land of the motherland in 12 years."

　　Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, read out the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China at the meeting, and warm applause resounded throughout the venue. After the congratulatory telegram was read, the representatives stood up again and applauded enthusiastically for a long time.

　　Bai Zhimin, Deputy Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, congratulated the conference on behalf of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the people of the province. Bai Zhimin said: "Yan'an is the sacred revolutionary site that the Chinese people yearn for. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao planned the grand strategy of the Chinese revolution here for a long time and led the people of the whole country to carry out a victorious revolutionary struggle. Today, when we hold this oath-taking conference to green the motherland here and call on the youth and children of the whole country to march towards nature, we cannot help but recall how the Chinese revolution went through a long and arduous struggle to achieve a great victory, and thus we have even more confidence in the victory of greening the motherland." Bai Zhimin expressed his firm belief that this conference will definitely be a successful conference, which will set off a nationwide tree-planting movement and make our motherland's beautiful rivers and mountains even more beautiful.

　　Xue Haiping, Secretary of the Yan'an County Committee of the Communist Party of China, then delivered a congratulatory speech at the meeting, saying: The people of Yan'an County, the Party and government of Yan'an County welcome and support the conference with the greatest enthusiasm, and have set off a widespread mass tree planting movement and a climax of soil and water conservation throughout the county. The representatives have brought rich experience in tree planting and doing a good job in soil and water conservation, which has also enhanced the confidence of the people of Yan'an County in conquering nature. The people of Yan'an County will work together with the representatives to strive for the construction of our beautiful and happy motherland with socialist enthusiasm.

　　In the evening, the representatives attended a welcome party jointly held by various agencies and organizations in Yan'an Prefecture and Yan'an County.
