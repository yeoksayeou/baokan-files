Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, March 20th: Farmers in the Dongting Lake area are vigorously organizing irrigation and drainage systems to change the situation of waterlogging in low-lying areas. This mass water conservancy project began at the start of this year. During the peak stage, more than 300,000 people participated every day. Now, the project is nearing completion. Statistics show that the completed projects have involved over 40 million cubic meters of earthwork, exceeding the total earthwork of irrigation and drainage projects in the six years since liberation by 43%.

This irrigation and drainage project is being organized in a unified manner according to the natural terrain, with polders as units. After the reorganization, the vast lakeside plains now have crisscrossing main and branch canals, like blood vessels in the human body. During the rainy season, the accumulated water in the low-lying areas can be drained out of the polders along the canals, and in times of drought, water can be drawn for irrigation. As a result, the area of guaranteed-yield farmland has increased. In the Changde Special District alone, the area of guaranteed-yield farmland can be expanded by more than 1.22 million mu. Due to the merging of polders and streams, the abolition of some ditches and ports, and the rational utilization of many open spaces, the cultivated land area can also be expanded by more than 137,000 mu.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 20th: Most of the drainage systems planned for construction this year in the Jianghan Plain of Hubei Province have now been completed. In the past five months, more than 5,000 ditches and sluice gates have been built in eight counties including Jianli and Honghu. The largest drainage project here, the Sihu Drainage Project, has completed more than 400,000 cubic meters of earthwork. After the completion of the first phase of this project this year, 400,000 mu of land can be restored and reclaimed into good farmland because the perennial waterlogging has been eliminated. On the drainage construction sites in the Tianmen River and Zaoshi River areas on the north bank of the Han River, tens of thousands of migrant workers are still working hard to complete this year's drainage project plan before the rainy season in June.

    洞庭湖滨地区农民整理排灌系统
    江汉平原兴修的排水工程大部分完工
    据新华社长沙20日电　洞庭湖滨地区农民，大力整理排灌系统改变洼地的内涝情况。这个群众性的水利工程，是从今年初开始的。在进入高潮阶段，每天有三十多万人参加。现在，工程已经接近完成，据统计到目前止，已经完成的工程，共达四千多万土方，超过解放六年来排灌工程土方总和的43％。
    这次排灌工程，是以垸为单位按自然形势统一进行整理的。经过整理后的辽阔湖滨平原，现在，纵横的干渠支港像人身上的血管一样穿插其间。雨季里，洼地的渍水可以顺着渠港排流出垸，天旱时，又可引水灌溉，因此，保收田增多了。在常德专区范围内就可扩大保收田122万多亩。由于并垸并流，废除部分沟港合理利用很多空地，还可扩大耕地面积十三万七千多亩。
    据新华社武汉20日电　湖北省江汉平原今年计划兴修的排水系统，目前大部分工程已经完工。近五个月来，监利和洪湖等八个县，已经修建沟渠和斗闸五千多处。这里最大的排水工程——四湖排水工程，已经完成了四十多万土方。这项工程的第一期工程今年完工以后，就有四十万亩土地，因为排除了常年渍水，可以恢复和开垦成为良田。汉水北岸天门河、皂市河一带的排水工地上，近来，仍有数以万计的民工在紧张劳动，他们要在六月雨季以前，完成今年的排水工程计划。
