    Oppose "Holding Back"
    Fang Qing
    When the "July 1st" Youth Coal Mining Team of the Second Pit of the Nanshan Mine of the Hegang Mining Bureau was formulating its production plan, technician Feng Jisan helped calculate the output. The calculation showed that the Five-Year Plan could be completed fifteen months ahead of schedule, but he said it could only be completed fourteen months ahead of schedule. When technician Du Ji'en of the Third Pit of the mine designed the coal mining face, each mining face was also shorter than the actual coal seam situation. That is to say, according to this design, some of the coal that could be mined would have to be left underground.
    Why do they do this? It is said that they are doing it to leave some "room for maneuver" for completing the task. However, in this way, the leading organs of the enterprise have no way to grasp the real situation. Their motives for holding back are nothing more than the following two: one is laziness, attempting to complete the task without effort; the other is the idea of seeking credit, hoping to get a reward for exceeding the task.
    This kind of thinking also exists elsewhere. When the Dahailin Forestry Bureau of Heilongjiang Province was compiling its cost plan, it calculated some items that could increase costs very carefully, but completely failed to include more than 20 factors that could reduce costs in the plan, so that the planned cost for 1956 was even higher than the actual cost for 1955.
    In the industrial sector, some people cannot see the vast advanced things, cannot see the creativity of the masses and the potential strength in enterprises. This kind of conservative thinking is unacceptable, and we must resolutely oppose it. However, the idea of "holding back" is clearly seeing the potential strength but not developing it, which is not only conservative, but also includes deception. In order to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, we must resolutely oppose this tendency and make those who attempt to complete the state plan "ahead of schedule" sitting in an easy chair nervous, and expose the truth they have concealed. Even if their attempt is not exposed in time, and they "over-fulfill" the state plan by this means, they should not be rewarded, but should be given strict criticism and punishment.

    反对“留一手”
    方青
    鹤岗矿务局南山矿第二坑“七一”青年采煤队制定生产计划的时候，由技术员冯继三帮助计算产量。计算的结果，分明可以提前十五个月完成五年计划，但是，他说只能提前十四个月完成。这个矿第三坑的技术员杜积恩设计采煤工作面的时候，每一个采煤工作面也比煤层的实际情况短一些，就是说按照这个设计图采煤，一定要把一部分可以采出来的煤留在井下。
    为什么要这样做呢？据说，他们是为了给完成任务留点“机动余地”。可是，这样一来，企业的领导机关就没有办法掌握真实情况了。他们这种留一手的动机，不外以下两种：一是偷懒，企图不费劲就可以完成任务；二是邀功思想，超过任务后好得奖。
    这种思想在别处也有。黑龙江省大海林森林工业局在编制成本计划的时候，把一些可以增加成本的项目，算得很仔细，却把二十多项可以降低成本的因素完全不算到计划里去，以致1956年的计划成本比1955年的实际成本还高。
    在工业部门中，有一些人看不到广大的先进的事物，看不到群众的创造性和企业里的潜在力量。这种保守思想是要不得的，我们要坚决反对。但是，“留一手”思想是明明看到了潜在力量而不去发挥，这就不仅仅是保守，而且加上欺骗了。为了提前完成五年计划，我们要坚决反对这种倾向，必须叫那些企图坐在安乐椅上“超额”完成国家计划的人紧张起来，把他们隐瞒的真象揭开来。即使他们的企图没有被及时地揭发出来，用这种手段“超额”完成了国家计划，也不能使他们得到奖励，反而要给以严格的批评和处分。
