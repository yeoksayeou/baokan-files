Xinhua News Agency, 15th: The National Youth Literary Creators Conference opened this afternoon in Beijing.

This kind of conference is a first in Chinese history. At this conference, young literary creators will discuss the prosperity of literary creation and the training of new forces with older generation writers.

Liu Baiyu delivered the opening speech on behalf of the presidium of the conference today. He said that our literary and art cause urgently needs more and better successors. The work outline of the Chinese Writers Association from 1956 to 1967 has already listed the training of young writers as one of the important tasks. This conference is a mobilization meeting and also a learning meeting. He hopes that this conference can mobilize the vast number of young literary creators to make unremitting efforts to build the motherland's socialist literature, and enable the delegates to learn something useful.

Lao She, vice chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, gave a report entitled "The Cultivation that Young Writers Should Have" at the meeting. In his report, based on his 30 years of experience in literary creation, he encouraged young literary creators to study diligently and practice hard, and always persevere; study more and practice more, and gradually improve; go deep into life and understand comprehensively; improve thinking and pay attention to theory.

Chen Yi, Minister of the Cultural Department of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, also spoke at today's meeting.

This conference is jointly convened by the Chinese Writers Association and the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and is scheduled to last for 15 days. More than 480 young male and female literary creators of various ethnic groups are participating in the conference. They come from 25 provinces and cities, as well as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and the Tibet region. Among them are young literary creators from the army and young playwrights who are participating in the first National Drama Festival in Beijing. Among the delegates participating in the conference, amateur literary creators account for 82%, and those under 30 account for 80%.
