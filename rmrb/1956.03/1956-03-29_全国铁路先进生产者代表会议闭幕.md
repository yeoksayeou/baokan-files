Among them, the initiative of "Locomotive Daily Production of One Million Ton-Kilometers Competition" signed by 408 advanced producers proposed to earnestly study and promote the advanced experience of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew and other advanced contracted groups in hauling fast and overweight trains, strive to complete the daily production of one million ton-kilometers per locomotive, save 2% of fuel consumption compared to the national planned target, and railway drivers across the country strive to save 100,000 tons of coal this year. The initiative of promoting the "Registered Locomotive Turnover Diagram" in the national railway, jointly proposed by 402 advanced producers, aims to improve railway transportation organization, accelerate the turnover of locomotives and vehicles, and the transportation of materials. Advanced producers in new railway engineering advocated accelerating the construction speed of new railway projects, ensuring the Baocheng Railway is connected in this year's "July 1st", the railway part of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is opened to traffic in October 1957, the highway part is opened to traffic at the end of 1957, and the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway is opened to traffic to Yumen in this year's "July 1st". Mechanical excavation of tunnels should reach 180 meters per end per month. Labor productivity should be increased by 10% compared to the 1955 quota. It is also necessary to save 20% of fuel oil, timber, and steel, and save 25% of cement.

In his closing speech, Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan said that all these initiatives summarize a variety of advanced experiences, which is a good way to specifically promote advanced experiences. He called on railway workers across the country to actively respond to these initiatives, and urged leading cadres to enthusiastically support and promptly solve the problems discovered in the competition movement.

The meeting elected three hundred representatives from the railway system to attend the National Advanced Producers Representative Meeting.

The meeting passed a letter to railway workers across the country.

The meeting lasted for nine days, from March 20th to 28th. During the meeting, the attending representatives widely exchanged more than 200 kinds of advanced experiences. These advanced experiences included the advanced experiences of various jobs in railway transportation work such as locomotive driving, dispatching, and line and bridge maintenance, as well as the best experiences in various aspects of new railway engineering such as tunnel excavation, bridge construction, and roadbed laying.

Members of the Soviet railway delegation who were invited to attend the meeting—driver Soloviev, female dispatcher Koroleva, road maintenance foreman Udalov, and hub station chief Levenko—also introduced their advanced experiences at the meeting, which were warmly welcomed by the representatives.
