    The current socialist revolution is reaching a climax, and the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and staff across the country is unprecedentedly high. Socialist emulation is being carried out on an even wider scale. With the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, the broad masses of workers and staff have launched a struggle against right-leaning conservative thinking and bureaucratic phenomena, and have put forward a large number of suggestions for improving production. A large number of workers have broken old quotas and created new and higher quotas. The CPC Central Committee believes that this manifestation of the Chinese working class in carrying out socialist construction with revolutionary spirit is extremely valuable. The Tenth Session of the Presidium of the Seventh Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions made a resolution on carrying out the advanced producers movement based on the demands and actions of the national workers and staff to accelerate socialist industrial construction. This is completely necessary, timely, and correct.
    Workers, engineering and technical personnel, and enterprise management personnel in all national economic sectors such as industry, agriculture, and transportation, as well as scientific, cultural, educational, health, and state organ personnel, should all stand at their posts, give full play to their initiative and creativity, and closely cooperate and help each other, so as to further promote our country's economic construction under the principle of combining "more, faster, better, and more economical"; all should strive to improve their professional skills and proficiency, learn from advanced experience, and become advanced producers or advanced workers. At the same time, every advanced producer and advanced worker should actively help those who are lagging behind to reach the advanced level, in order to improve together and strive to complete and overfulfill our country's First Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy ahead of schedule.
    The CPC Central Committee believes that Party committees, administrative departments, trade union organizations, and Communist Youth League organizations at all levels must strengthen their leadership over the advanced producers movement, oppose right-leaning conservative thinking and bureaucratic work styles, and must attract the masses with their own active actions and open self-criticism, mobilize the criticism of the masses, support all reasonable suggestions of workers and staff, and firmly grasp the important link of summarizing advanced experience and promoting advanced experience, and take specific technical and organizational measures that are in line with reality, so as to ensure the wide-ranging development of the advanced producers movement, making this movement the most extensive and profound mass movement, and a powerful driving force for the development of our country's socialist economy.
    Party committees at all levels, especially municipal committees, district committees, and enterprise party committees, should discuss this resolution of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions based on their own actual conditions, formulate their own plans for implementation, and guide the local trade union organizations to specifically arrange their own work.

    中共中央关于积极领导先进生产者运动的通知
    在目前的社会主义革命高潮中，全国职工群众的劳动热情空前高涨，社会主义竞赛正在以更加广泛的规模开展起来。广大职工群众以批评和自我批评的精神，向右倾保守思想和官僚主义现象展开了斗争，并且提出了大量的改进生产的建议。大批工人打破了陈旧的定额，创造了新的更高的定额。中共中央认为我国工人阶级这种以革命精神进行社会主义建设的表现是十分宝贵的。中华全国总工会第七届执行委员会主席团第十次会议，根据全国职工群众加速社会主义工业建设的要求和行动，作出了关于开展先进生产者运动的决议，这是完全必要的、及时的和正确的。
    全国一切工业、农业、交通运输业等国民经济部门的工人、工程技术人员和企业管理人员，科学、文化、教育、卫生和国家机关的工作人员，都应该站在自己的工作岗位上，高度地发挥积极性和创造性，而又密切配合，相互帮助，在“又多、又快、又好、又省”相结合的方针下把我国的经济建设更推进一步；都应该努力提高自己的业务水平和熟练程度，学习先进经验，使自己成为一个先进生产者或先进工作者。同时，每一个先进生产者、先进工作者都要积极帮助落后者达到先进水平，以求共同提高，争取提前和超额完成我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划。
    中共中央认为，各级党委、行政部门、工会组织和青年团组织，都必须加强对于先进生产者运动的领导，反对右倾保守思想和官僚主义作风，都必须以自己的积极行动和公开的自我批评吸引群众，发动群众的批评，支持职工的一切合理化建议，抓紧总结先进经验和推广先进经验这一重要环节，采取切合实际的具体的技术组织措施，以便保证先进生产者运动的广泛开展，使这个运动成为最广泛、最深刻的群众运动，成为发展我国社会主义经济的强大动力。
    各级党委特别是市委、区委和企业党委应该根据自己的实际情况，讨论中华全国总工会这一决议，制定自己执行的计划，并指导当地的工会组织具体布置自己的工作。　　　1956年3月12日
