    Seriously Evaluate and Select Advanced Producer Representatives
    Ying Lin
    The purpose of evaluating and selecting advanced producers and launching advanced producer movements is known to the leading cadres of factories and mines. Since this is the case, all factories and mines should seriously evaluate and select representatives to attend provincial and municipal advanced producer representative conferences.
    However, there are now two different methods of evaluation. One method is correct. For example, when the Shaanxi No. 2 Cotton Mill evaluated and selected advanced producer representatives, the heads of the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League, along with workshop cadres, first checked the various materials of advanced producers emerging from the masses of workers and conducted technical measurements and appraisals. Then, they used radio broadcasts, blackboards, and big-character posters to vigorously publicize the advanced deeds of advanced producers, mobilizing the masses of workers to repeatedly evaluate the advanced producer representative candidates. This created a wave of enthusiasm throughout the factory for learning and promoting advanced experiences, and new achievements have already emerged in the production of some workshops and teams. The other method is incorrect: when the Xi'an Transportation Company's West Station Transportation Station "evaluated" advanced producer representatives, the union chairman and production committee member selected two representatives from those attending the Xi'an Municipal Advanced Producer Representative Conference and then passed them at an advanced producer forum, considering them selected to attend the Shaanxi Provincial Advanced Producer Representative Conference. The reason this unit adopted this simplistic approach was that the union chairman believed that since advanced producer representatives for Xi'an had already been selected, re-evaluating them would waste time and delay production. This approach, while not delaying production, did not improve or enhance production, because the station's more than two thousand employees were unaware that there was such a thing as evaluating advanced producer representatives. Does this meet the purpose and requirements of evaluating advanced producer representatives?
    After repeated criticism from higher authorities, the West Station Transportation Station of the Xi'an Transportation Company has changed this simplistic approach. However, similar situations are not isolated in our industrial, mining, and transportation departments. This requires Party organizations in various localities to effectively strengthen their leadership over the evaluation of advanced producers and urge relevant units to earnestly do this work well.

    认真地评选先进生产者代表
    应麟
    评选先进生产者，开展先进生产者运动的目的，厂矿企业领导干部都是知道的。既然如此，各厂矿就应当认真地评选出席省、市先进生产者代表会议的代表。
    但是现在有着两种不同的评选办法，一种方法是正确的，例如陕西第二棉织厂在评选先进生产者代表时，先由党、政、工、团的负责人和车间干部一起查对了职工群众中所涌现出来的先进生产者的各种材料，并且进行了技术测定和鉴定；然后又利用广播、黑板报和大字报等方式，向职工群众大张旗鼓地宣传先进生产者的先进事迹，发动职工群众对先进生产者代表候选人进行反复的评比。这样，就在全厂掀起了一个学习和推广先进经验的热潮，有些车间、小组生产上已经出现了新的成就。另一种方法是错误的：西安市运输公司西站运输站“评选”先进生产者代表时，却是由工会主席和生产委员在出席西安市先进生产者代表会议的代表中挑选了两名，再在先进生产者座谈会上通过一下，就算选出了出席陕西省先进生产者代表会议的代表。这个单位所以采取这种简单化的做法，原因是工会主席认为已经选过西安市的先进生产者代表，再来评选一次就会浪费时间，耽误生产。这种做法，固然没有耽误生产，但是也没有对生产起改进和提高的作用，因为全站的两千多职工都不知道有评选先进生产者代表这么一回事。这难道是符合于评选先进生产者代表的目的和要求的吗？
    在受到上级一再的批评以后，西安市运输公司西站运输站已经改变了这种简单化的作法。但是在我们的工矿企业和交通运输部门中，类似这样的事情不是个别的。这就要求各地的党组织必须切实加强对评选先进生产者工作的领导，督促有关的单位认真地做好这个工作。
