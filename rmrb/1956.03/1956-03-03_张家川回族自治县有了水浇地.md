    Zhangjiachuan Hui Autonomous County in Gansu Province, which historically did not have a single mu of irrigated land, has now, after basically achieving agricultural collectivization, had farmers of all ethnic groups dig more than 6,400 wells and more than 400 springs in the last 4 days. They have also dug more than 110 channels. According to experienced local farmers, these small-scale farmland water conservancy projects are of good quality and can transform more than 47,000 mu of dry land into irrigated land. This year, Zhangjiachuan Hui Autonomous County will develop 200,000 mu of irrigated land, basically eliminating drought.

    张家川回族自治县有了水浇地
    历史上从来没有一亩水浇地的甘肃省张家川回族自治县，在基本上实现了农业合作化以后，各族农民在最近的4天中打了6，400多眼水井和400多个水泉，同时还挖了110多条渠道。据当地有经验的老农民谈，这些小型的农田水利建设，质量都很好，能把47，000多亩旱地改造成水浇地。今年，张家川回族自治县将发展20万亩水浇地，基本上消灭旱灾。
