Xinhua News Agency, 20th - The International Commission for Vietnam recently submitted its fifth working report. The report describes the situation of the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam from August 11th to December 10th last year and the work of the International Commission.

The report emphasizes that the main problem in implementing the Geneva Accords in Vietnam at present is that the South Vietnamese authorities still claim that they are not bound by the Geneva Accords. Due to this situation, the work of the International Commission has become more difficult during the reporting period. The International Commission once again expresses its hope that this major problem will be resolved quickly by the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference and other participating countries.

The report condemns the South Vietnamese authorities for continuing to violate the Geneva Accords, persecuting former resistance members in South Vietnam, and obstructing the International Commission's investigation work in this regard. During the reporting period, the International Commission continued to receive many accusations regarding the persecution of former resistance members by South Vietnam. The International Commission has repeatedly decided to send mobile teams to conduct on-site investigations, but the South Vietnamese authorities have used various excuses to prevent these mobile teams from going to the field to work. In addition, during the reporting period, the International Commission also made conclusions on certain investigations that mobile teams had already completed in the past, and determined three times that the South Vietnamese authorities had violated the provisions of the Geneva Accords regarding the protection of former resistance members in South Vietnam, and demanded that the South Vietnamese authorities punish the relevant personnel. However, the South Vietnamese authorities have not responded. The International Commission stated in the report that the above-mentioned circumstances "cause the International Commission serious concern."

The report also mentioned the various obstructions by the South Vietnamese authorities to the work of the International Commission's fixed teams stationed in various parts of South Vietnam. One of the main tasks of these fixed teams is to supervise the implementation of regulations regarding the non-entry of military personnel and war materials into Vietnam. The report points out that the freedom of movement of the fixed teams stationed in South Vietnam has been unreasonably restricted in various ways. For example, the South Vietnamese authorities require these teams to notify the local authorities 48 hours before departing for inspection, while according to the regulations of the International Commission, in order to ensure the effectiveness of supervision, these teams should notify the local authorities at most two hours before departing for inspection. The report also mentioned that many American military aircraft arrived at Saigon Airport, but the airport authorities did not report to the Saigon fixed team in advance as required. In addition, there are difficulties in the supervision of ships traveling along the Mekong River between South Vietnam and Cambodia by the fixed team in South Vietnam. The report said that the International Commission has raised these issues with the French and South Vietnamese sides, requesting them to be corrected.

    越南国际委员会提出第五次报告
    新华社20日讯　越南国际委员会最近提出了第五次工作报告。报告叙述了去年八月十一日到十二月十日在越南实施日内瓦协议的情况和国际委员会的工作。
    报告着重指出，目前在越南实施日内瓦协议的主要问题是：南越当局仍然声称它不受日内瓦协议的约束。由于这种情况，在报告期间，国际委员会的工作已经更加困难。国际委员会再一次表示希望上述这个主要问题将由日内瓦会议两位主席和其他参加国迅速加以解决。
    报告谴责南越当局继续违反日内瓦协议，迫害南越前抗战人员，并且阻挠国际委员会在这一方面的调查工作。在报告期间，国际委员会继续收到有关南越迫害前抗战人员的许多指控。国际委员会曾多次决定派遣机动小组进行实地调查，但是南越当局却用种种借口不让这些机动小组前往现场工作。此外，在报告期间，国际委员会也曾对某些机动小组过去所已经完成的调查作出结论，又三次确定南越当局破坏了日内瓦协议关于保障南越前抗战人员的规定，并且要求南越当局惩办有关人员。但是南越当局一直没有答复。国际委员会在报告中说，上述种种情况“使国际委员会感到严重忧虑”。
    报告也提到南越当局对国际委员会分驻南越各地的固定小组的工作的种种阻难。这些固定小组的主要任务之一，就是要监督实施有关军事人员和作战物资不得进入越南的规定。报告指出：驻南越各固定小组的行动自由遭到各种无理的限制。例如，南越当局要求这些小组在出发视察前的48小时，就必须向地方当局提出通知，而根据国际委员会的规定，为了保证监督的有效性，这些小组最多只应该在出发视察前的二小时通知地方当局。报告并且提到，有许多美国军用飞机来到西贡机场，但是机场当局都没有按照规定事先向西贡固定小组报告。此外，在南越的固定小组对沿湄公河往来于南越和柬埔寨之间的船只的监督，也存在着困难。报告说，国际委员会已经将这些问题向法国和南越方面提出，要求加以纠正。
