    The Birth of a New Coal Mining Method
    By Our Correspondent Jin Yukun

    I
    When the leaders of the Fushun Tiger Platform Coal Mine were summarizing their work in 1955, they discovered that among the mine's 22 coal mining teams, working on the same 80-meter-wide face, some teams could produce more than 20,000 tons of coal per month, while others only reached 7,000 tons. Moreover, the high-yield teams mostly exceeded the prescribed progress and violated the original "Safety Regulations," but production was very safe. The low-yield teams' production was also not very safe. The coal mining team where Pang Guanxiang worked was one of the best-performing units in the entire mine, and also one of the safest.

    What was the reason for this?

    As early as the end of 1954, Pang Guanxiang had considered a problem: each time they mined coal, drilling only took half an hour, while setting up the supports and blasting took two or three hours. Whether the holes were drilled shallow or deep, they always had to set up the supports and blast once. Then, if the holes were drilled deeper, more coal would be blasted out. Wouldn't this lead to more coal production? Therefore, he increased the drilling depth from the original 1.1 meters to 1.7 meters. In 1955, this team completed the state plan 58 days ahead of schedule while ensuring safety.

    Pang Guanxiang knew that this was the right thing to do, but he couldn't drill the holes any deeper. Because the operating procedures stipulated that drilling should not exceed 1.6 meters, and exceeding it was "illegal," and the mine would immediately stop your work! If the holes were drilled deeper, the amount of gunpowder needed would exceed that prescribed in the safety regulations, which was also "illegal"! Even if the holes were drilled deeper and more gunpowder was loaded, the mining height had to be correspondingly higher than the prescribed 1.8-2.2 meters, otherwise, the power of the gunpowder would not be fully exerted, but this was also "illegal." Pang Guanxiang, who wanted to produce more coal, was restricted by the old regulations and systems.

    II
    On the morning of December 21, 1955, Pang Guanxiang was called to the trade union while he was drilling underground.

    The trade union room was full of people. The tall and stout Pang Guanxiang attracted everyone's attention as soon as he entered the door. When he learned that the trade union had convened a symposium of advanced producers to discuss how to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, he was extremely excited. Before he even sat down, he rushed to say, "In my opinion, to produce more coal, we must break the unreasonable old rules. Take our team as an example. We haven't even used half of our strength yet! We are trapped in the circle of old regulations, restricted on the left and restricted on the right. How can we produce more coal?"

    Chairman Dong of the Fushun Mining Area Trade Union, who was presiding over the symposium, smiled. He gently said to the clever, small technician Zhou Guangrui next to him, "Look, this young man is not only energetic in his work, but also has a lot of energy when he speaks." Then he asked:

    "Lao Pang, what are you planning to do?"

    "The main thing is to overthrow the rules and regulations of the coal mine. To produce more coal, first we must drill deeper holes, second we must load more gunpowder, and third we must increase the height of mining..."

    Chairman Dong asked some more details and then consulted Zhou Guangrui's opinion. Zhou Guangrui had also considered this issue for a long time and had also conducted experiments. Now, hearing Lao Pang's method, it was truly a coincidence. He immediately explained the possibility of this reform from a theoretical perspective.

    Chairman Dong enthusiastically instructed Lao Zhou:

    "That would be great. You will be responsible for helping Lao Pang. We must make this reform a reality. I wish you success!"

    III
    People who don't understand the history of the Fushun Mining Area would find it difficult to understand how profound the significance of this upcoming reform was.

    In 1950, the Fushun Mining Area formulated a set of safety regulations. With the improvement of coal mining technology and changes in other conditions, these regulations were long outdated, but conservatives regarded them as "sacred and inviolable." Workers said: The Constitution can be amended, and the Party Constitution can also be amended, but only our regulations cannot be amended! Ding Yishan, a 30-year veteran miner and district chief of the Seventh Mining Area, had already reformed the 40-year-old method of setting up supports in 1953, which could both ensure safety and save one-third of the pit wood. However, this extremely important reform was considered by the leadership to be "a violation of the regulations," and even the coal produced that day was rejected for acceptance. The enthusiasm of the workers in the Fushun Mining Area was severely dampened.

    Now, Zhou Guangrui and Pang Guanxiang have stood up again, and they are determined to launch an offensive against the old rules and regulations of the mining area.

    IV
    After five nights of consideration, Zhou Guangrui finally wrote the reform plan. Implementing this plan would increase the average daily output of each coal miner from 4 tons in the past to 9.7 tons. A mining area that originally took two and a half years to mine could be completed in just one and a half years. The material management costs alone could be saved by 1.4 million yuan.

    The Party committee immediately discussed this reform plan. The Party committee members listened with great interest to Zhou Guangrui's detailed introduction and immediately decided to start the experiment on January 5th. In order to ensure the smooth progress of the reform, the Party committee made three more decisions: Deputy Party Secretary Yin Jiasheng was responsible for ideological mobilization; Party committee member and trade union chairman was responsible for organizational work; and Party committee member and director of the dispatch room was responsible for solving the problems of materials and equipment.

    People thought that things would go smoothly.

    V
    On the morning of December 30, 1955, Deputy Mine Manager Wang Zhenhai was writing a summary in the sanatorium. As soon as he started writing, Zhou Guangrui called to say that the workers' morale was extremely high and asked to conduct the experiment ahead of schedule. Mine Manager Wang decided to go and encourage them personally.

    As soon as he arrived in the district, he met two technicians from the bureau, who were also there to learn about the reform. When Mine Manager Wang and Lao Zhou talked about the unsupported roof distance exceeding 5.6 meters, the technician surnamed Jiang immediately raised a series of questions: "The unsupported roof distance is so large, I'm afraid it won't work, right?" "The mining height is too high, I'm afraid there will be problems, right?" "Opening 40 meters at a time, I'm afraid it's not safe, right?" "Too much explosives will overturn the supports, right?" In a word, he was full of concerns and unwilling to break the outdated regulations.

    The two technicians turned around in the mine and returned to the bureau.

    Mine Manager Wang saw that the situation was not quite right, so he said to Lao Zhou:

    "I'm afraid things will get more troublesome. Seeing so many 'suspicions' and 'worries' of theirs, who knows what they will report back! Forget it, let's take the initiative and report directly to the bureau."

    In the office of the chief engineer of the mining bureau, Deputy Mine Manager Wang Zhenhai, Mine Chief Engineer Zhou Yongfa, and Technician Zhou Guangrui attended a meeting presided over by the deputy chief engineer of the mining bureau. Zhou Guangrui answered various questions very nervously. The argument over the mining height had just subsided, and new problems continued to arise.

    "Now that the progress is faster, the roof pressure increases, what if a roof collapse accident occurs?"

    "This problem does not exist! We will improve the support method accordingly, and change from setting up supports after blasting to setting them up before blasting. In this way, the actual unsupported roof distance has not increased, but can only be safer than before."

    However, the technician surnamed Jiang asked again: "The amount of gunpowder has increased, what if the supports are overturned?"

    "We have also found a solution. The first is to change the drilling angle to straight, so that the blasting force will spread up and down, making it less likely to overturn the supports; the second is to choose the position of the hole in the middle of the two legs; the third is to use sandbags instead of yellow mud. With these three measures, we can ensure safety and fully exert the power of the explosion."

    "Whether the supports will be overturned or not, I'm afraid there's no certainty, right?" The technician surnamed Jiang continued to ask.

    "The method we proposed is based on facts, because we have already experimented with it."

    There was a brief silence in the meeting. Zhou Guangrui was sweating all over. Mine Manager Wang handed him a cup of boiled water and asked him to rest and calm down before continuing.

    After a while, another technician asked: "The distance of 1.1 meters between each hole does not meet the calculation requirements, I'm afraid it won't break the coal, right?"

    "Yes, I also used your formula to calculate, and it doesn't work. But the workers on the site just used this distance to break open the coal seam. Of course, we should have more faith in the experience of the masses in practice," Pang Guanxiang replied.

    At this time, Fei Guangtai, the chief engineer of the mining bureau, who had not participated in the discussion at the beginning due to other matters, also joined in the speech. He said with emotion: "In our Fushun Mining Area, conservative thinking has always been reasonable and legal for many years. Because our regulations and systems are outdated, whoever is not conservative is 'illegal'. Now, I hope it is time to change this unreasonable situation."

    Hearing the old engineer's words, Zhou Guangrui's nervous mood suddenly relaxed.

    Everyone was waiting for the representative of the Fushun Mining Area National Technical Safety Supervision Bureau to express his attitude. But this representative did not express any opinion, just saying "I have to go back and study it, study it."

    Based on past experience, everyone knew that the so-called "study study" was likely to be unsuccessful.

    Mine Manager Wang stood up, his attitude somewhat agitated: "I think it is necessary to conduct a serious discussion of the workers' new creations, but we must never be afraid of everything. Of course, a major reform can be as perfect as possible, but things that have not been practiced are often impossible to be perfect. Since you think it needs to be further studied, then we will not go back, we will study it this afternoon. In this way, it will be good to ask us if there is anything unclear."

    Mine Manager Wang's opinion was impossible to refuse. Because everyone estimated that the situation would be more complicated in the afternoon, they agreed that Mine Manager Wang would go to the Party Committee of the Fushun Mining Area to ask for support, and the chief engineer and Zhou Guangrui would first attend the meeting of the Supervision Bureau. Finally, the Supervision Bureau's consent was obtained.

    VI
    At two o'clock in the afternoon on January 5th, the experiment of the new coal mining method began.

    Like a long, dark alley with no end in sight, rows of supports were like neat house frames. At one end of the working face, Pang Guanxiang held the handle of the electric drill, his tall and sturdy body leaning forward, pushing the drill bit forward with all his strength. The crisp rhythm vibrated on the working face, and the drill bit, like a long snake, quickly drilled into the hard, black coal seam, and the coal filings crushed by the drill bit sprayed out of the small hole. The mine lamp shone brightly on the dark coal wall. Pang Guanxiang forgot his fatigue, and sweat kept streaming down his face. He drilled one hole after another. He also often helped his partners choose the location for drilling.

    At more than 5 o'clock, the first batch of more than 100 blastholes had been drilled. Pang Guanxiang and others turned to another section to work. Then, there was a muffled thunder-like explosion sound—the blasting team's operation began.

    As soon as Pang Guanxiang heard the sound of the coal seam collapsing, he couldn't hold back his heart any longer. He handed the electric drill to his partner and ran to observe the blasting situation. At this time, Zhou Guangrui, who was running around on the working face, also arrived. As soon as he saw that the coal had collapsed and the roof was very neat, and the support situation was very good, this reform had withstood the first severe test. Pang Guanxiang, like an innocent child, ran and shouted to report the good news to his partners.

    Coal, like a black stream, was constantly flowing forward along the conveyor belt... Too much coal was being produced! All the coal cars were filled at once, and there was simply no time to transport them. Suddenly, the coal storage warehouse was also full. Then, the hundreds of meters long belt conveyor was also blocked, the scraper conveyor was also full, and the entire transportation system was blocked. By the time they went up the well at 11:30 in the evening, a total of 724 tons had been produced (usually around 500 tons). The next day, they mined 949 tons, and this was achieved under the harsh conditions of half gangue and half coal. Now they are striving to achieve a daily output of 1,800 tons. The regulations and systems that had dominated coal mining for many years were finally broken through, and a new coal mining method was born through layers of obstacles!

    新采煤法的诞生
    本报记者　金雨困		一
    抚顺老虎台煤矿的领导人在总结1955年度工作的时候，发现在全矿22个采煤班中，同在80公尺大的工作面上，有的班月产煤可达2万多吨，有的班只达到7，000多吨；而且产量高的班，大都超过了所规定的进度，违反了原订的“保安规程”，但是生产很安全；产量低的班，生产也并不安全。采煤工人庞观祥所在的采煤班，是全矿生产较好的单位，也是全矿安全较好的单位。
    这是什么原因呢？
    早在1954年末，庞观祥就考虑过一个问题：每次采煤的时候，打眼不过半小时，而架棚子、放炮就得花二三小时。不管眼打得浅还是深，都是架一次棚子、放一次炮。那末，如果把眼打得深些，炸出来的煤就多一些，这不是可以出更多的煤了吗？于是，他就把打眼的深度由原来的1.1公尺提高到1.7公尺。在1955年度中，这个班就这样在保证安全的情况下，提前58天完成了国家计划。
    庞观祥知道这样做是对的，但是不能把眼打得更深一些。因为操作规程规定，打眼不得超过1.6公尺，超过了就是“违法”，矿上立刻就停止你的工作！眼打得深了，需要的火药就要超过保安规程上规定的，这又是“违法”！即使眼打得深了，火药多装了，采煤的高度必须相应地超过规定的1.8—2.2公尺，不然，火药的力量就施展不开，但是这也是“违法”。想多多出煤的庞观祥被旧的规程制度束缚住了。		二
    1955年12月21日早晨，庞观祥在井下钻眼的时候，就被叫到工会去了。
    工会的房间里坐满了人。个子又粗又高的庞观祥一进门就引起大家的注意。当他知道是工会召集先进生产者座谈，讨论如何提前完成五年计划的时候，他兴奋极了，还没有坐下，就抢着说：“我看，要多出煤，非打破不合理的陈规不可，拿我们的班来说，现在的劲儿还没有使出一半来呢！我们被圈在旧规程的圈子里，左一个限制，右一个限制，怎能多出煤呢？”
    主持座谈会的抚顺矿区工会董主席乐了。他轻轻地对旁边的精明的小个子技术员周广瑞说：“看，这个小伙子不光是干活有劲，说起话来也有股劲儿”。说着便问道：
    “老庞，你准备怎么办呢？”
    “主要的，是把煤矿上的清规戒律，打倒，要多出煤，第一要深打眼，第二要多装火药，第三要提高采高的高度……”
    董主席还问了一些细节，回头就征询周广瑞的意见。周广瑞也早就考虑过这个问题，也曾进行过试验。现在，听到老庞的办法，真是不谋而合。他马上从理论上把这个改革的可能性讲了一遍。
    董主席热情地嘱咐老周：
    “那就太好了，就由你来负责帮助老庞，一定要使这个改革实现，预祝你们胜利！”		三
    不了解抚顺矿区历史的人，是很难了解这个即将出现的改革有着多么深刻的意义。
    1950年，抚顺矿区制定了一个保安规程。随着采煤技术的提高和其它条件的改变，这个规程早就过时了，但是保守主义者把它视为“神圣不可侵犯”的。工人们说：宪法可以修改，党章也可以修改，独有我们的规程不能修改！30多年的老矿工、七采区区长丁义山，早在1953年就改革沿用了40年的架棚方法，既可保证安全，又可节约三分之一坑木。但是，这个极重要的改革，被领导上认为是“违反了规程”，连当天生产出来的煤都被拒绝验收。抚顺矿区职工群众的积极性受到了严重的挫伤。
    现在，周广瑞和庞观祥又站了起来，他们决心向矿区的陈规旧律发起攻势。		四
    经过五个夜晚的考虑，周广瑞终于写成了改革方案。实现这个方案，就可使每个采煤工人平均日产量将由过去的4吨提高到9.7吨，本来2年半才可以采完的一个采区，只要1年半就行了，仅材料管理费用就可节省140万元。
    党委会马上讨论这个改革方案。党委委员们以极大的兴趣听取了周广瑞的详细介绍，立即决定1月5日就开始试验。党委会为保证改革的顺利进行，又作了三项决定：党委副书记尹加胜负责思想动员；党委委员、工会主席负责组织工作；党委委员、调度室主任负责解决物资设备问题。
    人们满以为事情会一帆风顺了。		五
    1955年12月30日上午，副矿长王振海躲在休养所里写总结。刚刚动笔，周广瑞就来电话，说工人情绪高极了，要求提前进行试验。王矿长决定亲自去鼓励鼓励他们。
    一到区上，就碰上局里来的两位技术员，他们也正来这里了解这个改革的情况。当王矿长和老周谈到空顶距离将超过5.6公尺的时候，那位姓江的技术员马上提出一连串的疑问：“空顶距离这么大，恐怕不行吧？”“采高太高了，恐怕会发生问题吧？”“一次开帮40公尺，恐怕不安全吧？”“炸药太多要打翻棚子吧？”一句话，就是顾虑百出，不愿意打破过了时的规程。
    这两位技术员在矿上转了转就回到局里去了。
    王矿长一看苗头有点不对，就对老周说：
      “恐怕事情要增加麻烦了。看他们这么多的‘怀疑’和‘忧虑’，谁知道他们回去汇报些什么呢！算了吧，还是咱们主动点，直接到局里去汇报”。
    在矿务局总工程师办公室里，副矿长王振海、矿总工程师周永发和技术员周广瑞参加了一个由矿务局副总工程师主持的会议。周广瑞十分紧张地答辩着各种问题。采高的争论刚刚平息，新的问题又不断提出。
    “现在进度大了，顶板压力增加，发生冒顶事故怎么办？”
    “这个问题并不存在！我们将相应地改进架棚方法，而且把本来放炮后架棚子，改为放炮前就架好。这样，实际上空顶距离并没有增加，只能比过去更加安全。”
    可是，那个姓江的技术员又问了：“火药用量增加了，炸翻棚子怎么办？”
      “我们也找到了解决的办法。第一是把打眼角度改为直的，这样爆破力就向上下扩散，不易震翻棚子；第二，眼的位置选择在两条腿的中间；第三，用沙子口袋代替黄泥。有了这样三个措施，既能保证安全，又充分发挥爆炸威力。”
    “翻不翻棚子，恐怕没有个准吧？”姓江的仍然追着问道。
    “我们提出的办法，是有事实根据的，因为我们早就试验过。”
    会场上出现短时间的沉默。周广瑞脸上身上都流着汗。王矿长端杯开水给他，要他休息休息，冷静一下再说下去。
    不一会，又有一个技术员问：“每个眼1.1公尺的距离，不合乎计算要求，恐怕崩不开煤来吧？”
    “是的，我也曾用你的公式算过，也是算不通。可是工人在现场就是用这个距离崩开了煤层。当然，我们应该更加相信群众实践的经验。”庞观祥答道。
    这时，因其它事开始时没有参加讨论的矿务局总工程师费广泰，也参加进来发言了。他感触地说：“在我们抚顺矿区，多少年来保守思想一直是合理合法的。因为我们的规程制度过时了，谁不保守谁就‘违法’。现在，我希望是改变这种不合理情况的时候了。”
    听了老工程师的话，周广瑞紧张的心情突然轻松起来了。
    大家就等着抚顺矿区国家技术安全监察局代表表示态度了。可是这位代表什么意见也不表示，只是说“要回去研究，研究。”
    根据过去经验，谁都知道所谓“研究研究”，准是十有九不成。
    王矿长站起来，态度有些激动：“我认为对工人新的创造进行认真讨论是必要的，但是绝不能前怕狼后怕虎。当然，一项重大的改革能够越完善越好，但是未经实践的东西，往往是不可能十全十美的。既然你们认为需要继续研究，那我们就不回去了，下午就研究。这样，有不清楚的地方也好问我们。”
    王矿长的意见是没法拒绝的。因为大家估计下午的情况会更复杂，便商定由王矿长去抚顺矿区党委会，请求支持，总工程师和周广瑞先去参加监察局的会议。最后，终于取得监察局的同意。		六
    1月5日下午两点钟，试验新的采煤方法。
    像一条黑色的望不到头的长弄堂一样，一排一排的棚子像整齐的房架一般。在掌子面的一端，庞观祥提着电钻的把手，高大壮实的身子往前倾着，一股劲儿把电钻的钎子往前推移。清脆的节奏震动在掌面上，像长蛇似的钎子迅速地钻进了坚硬乌黑的煤层中去，被钎子研碎的煤屑从小孔中喷射出来。矿灯闪闪地照着乌亮的煤壁。庞观祥忘记了疲劳，脸上不住地流着汗，钻了一个眼接着又钻一个眼。他还不时地去帮助伙伴们选择打眼的位置。
    5点多钟，第一批100多个炮眼已钻好。庞观祥等又转到另一段进行工作了。随后，就响起了闷雷似的爆炸声音——爆破队的作业开始了。
    庞观祥一听到哗啦啦煤层崩裂的声音，心再也按不住了，把电钻交给了伙伴，就跑去观察爆破的情况。这时在掌子面上到处奔走的周广瑞也赶到了。一看，煤都崩下来了，顶板非常整齐，棚子情况很好，这个改革已经受过了第一个严重的考验。庞观祥像天真的孩子一般，边跑边喊地去向伙伴们报喜。
    煤，像黑色的溪流，沿着皮带不断地往前方流送出去……煤出得太多了！一下子所有的车皮装满了，简直来不及运送了。一下子储煤仓库也塞满了。接着，数百公尺长的皮带运输机也堵住了，刮板运输机也满了，运输系统全部堵塞了。到晚上11时半升井的时候，共出了724吨（平时500吨左右）。第二天，他们采了949吨，而且是在一半矸石一半煤的恶劣的条件下达到的。现在他们正在争取日产量达到1，800吨。在采煤方面统治了多少年的规程和制度，终于被冲破了，新的采煤方法冲破层层障碍诞生了！
