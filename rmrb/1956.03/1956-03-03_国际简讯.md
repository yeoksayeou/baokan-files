    △ The former Greek Prime Minister Constantine Karamanlis has formed a new government after the general election and was sworn in on February 29. The Deputy Prime Minister is Apostolidis, and the Foreign Minister is Theotokis. Western press commentators point out that Karamanlis, who holds only a slim majority in parliament, will face more difficulties, and the government he has formed will be an unstable one.
    △ According to a Reuters dispatch from Bangkok: Thai Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram announced at a press conference on the afternoon of February 29 that the Thai cabinet had decided to lift the order banning public gatherings. This order was implemented on February 21 after the authorities arrested members of the Thai People's Promotion of Friendly Visits to China Delegation and some people who were on hunger strike to oppose the government's appointment of members of parliament.
