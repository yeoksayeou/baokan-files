Workers from factories and mines in four provincial-level cities and small towns in Shanxi Province, including Taiyuan and Datong, have formed many visiting groups to go to the countryside. Agricultural production cooperatives around these towns have also sent representatives to the city to celebrate with the workers in recent days.

The representatives of the worker visiting groups and the members of the agricultural production cooperatives in various places held discussion meetings. The worker representatives who went to the Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fokou Town, Zuoquan County, helped the cooperative build a new agricultural tool repair station and club. During the visits, many worker representative groups presented agricultural machinery, transportation and communication equipment, and recreational supplies as gifts to the peasants.

The peasant representative groups participating in the celebrations in Taiyuan City visited factories such as the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, the Shanxi Machine Factory, and the Jinsheng Textile Factory. They were warmly welcomed by the workers. The Jinsheng Textile Factory also displayed all of its products to solicit opinions from the peasant representatives.
