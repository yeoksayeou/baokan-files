Many factories and mines, including the Tongchuan Mining Bureau's coal mines, the Northeast Petroleum No. 9 Plant, and the state-owned Nanjing Chemical Plant, have overfulfilled their national plans for the first quarter of this year ahead of schedule by seven to thirty-four days.

    The Tongchuan Mining Bureau did a relatively good job in preparing for production this year. In February, workers at the No. 1 Coal Mine also promoted the advanced experience of regular cyclic operation of a one-meter coal seam at Ping'an No. 1 Pit of the Fuxin Mining Bureau, and overproduced more than 3,600 tons of coal in one working face trial.

    Employees of Northeast Petroleum No. 9 Plant launched an advanced producer movement this year.  Aiming at the shortcomings of low oil extraction rate from stacked dry distillation, the workers of the Third Workshop created the advanced method of "Four Diligences and Two Accuracies," and the oil extraction rate in February increased by 54% compared with January.

    As of the 24th, nine factories in Nanjing, including the state-owned Nanjing Chemical Plant, Nanjing Pharmaceutical Factory, the local state-owned Jiangsu Machine Factory, and the joint state-private Nanjing Glass Factory, had completed their first quarter national plans ahead of schedule.

    许多厂矿完成第一季度生产计划
    铜川矿务局各煤矿、东北石油九厂和国营南京化工厂等许多厂矿，提前七天到三十四天超额完成了今年第一季度的国家计划。
    铜川矿务局今年的生产准备工作做得比较好。今年二月第一煤矿工人还推行了阜新矿务局平安一坑一公尺煤层正规循环作业的先进经验，在一个工作面试行就超额生产了三千六百多吨煤炭。
    东北石油九厂职工今年开展了先进生产者运动。三车间职工针对成堆干馏采油率不高的缺点，创造了四勤二准的先进方法，二月份采油率比一月份提高54％。
    到二十四日止，南京市已经有国营南京化工厂、南京制药厂、地方国营江苏机器厂和公私合营南京玻璃厂等九个工厂提前完成了第一季度国家计划。
