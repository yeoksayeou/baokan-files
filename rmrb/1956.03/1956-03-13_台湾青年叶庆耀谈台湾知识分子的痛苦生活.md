Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 12th: Recently, Taiwanese youth Ye Qingyao, who returned from Kinmen Island, spoke to a reporter from this agency about the painful life of Taiwanese intellectuals. Ye Qingyao graduated from the Department of Mechanical Engineering of the College of Engineering of National Taiwan University in 1952.

Ye Qingyao said that in National Taiwan University and other colleges and universities in Taiwan, there are large-scale "Guidance Groups." Faculty and students are required to have a "five-person joint guarantee," where if one person "violates the law," the other four are implicated. In addition to "strictly controlling students' thoughts," the personnel of the "Guidance Group" must also check students' books once a week.

Ye Qingyao said that in 1952, the 12负责人 in charge of the Student Self-Government Association of the College of Engineering of National Taiwan University were all arrested for criticizing the Kuomintang authorities' unreasonable measures on campus. Among them, Liao Shih-hao, Ye Shuitian, Zhou Jinyin, Zeng Zhouguo, and Lin Xiugao were shot by the Chiang Kai-shek clique in 1953. Ye Qingyao himself was imprisoned in the Green Island concentration camp. He said that in the 11th Brigade of the Green Island concentration camp where he was located, there were a total of 115 people, including 48 university and high school students, as well as doctors and engineers. In the 1st and 3rd Brigades, there were also 5 old professors who had taught at Shanghai Jiaotong University and Nanjing Central University before liberation. The "charges" against those imprisoned in the Green Island concentration camp were mostly so-called "ideological deviation," "violation of treasonous criminal offenses," and "failure to report knowledge of a crime."

Ye Qingyao said that the lives of Taiwanese intellectuals are extremely difficult. In addition to low salaries that are insufficient to support their families, unemployment has become a major threat to them. Of the 18 graduates of the Department of Mechanical Engineering of the College of Engineering of National Taiwan University in 1952, Lin Xiugao was shot, and Zeng Jinhai, Chen Dehe, Qiu Huande, Li Shen, and Ye Qingyao himself had been imprisoned in prisons and concentration camps successively over the years. Of the remaining 12, only 3 had jobs after graduation.

    谈台湾知识分子的痛苦生活
    据新华社福建前线12日电　最近从金门岛归来的台湾青年叶庆耀向本社记者谈台湾知识分子的痛苦生活。叶庆耀在1952年毕业于台湾大学工学院机械工程学系。
    叶庆耀说，在台湾大学和台湾其他专科以上学校里，都有规模庞大的“训导组”。教职人员和学生都要“五人连保”，一人“犯法”，其余四人株连。“训导组”的人员除了“严管学生思想”以外，每周还要检查一次学生的书籍。
    叶庆耀说，1952年台湾大学工学院学生自治会的12个负责人因为批评了国民党当局在校内的不合理措施，全部被捕。其中廖史豪、叶水田、周金印、曾舟国、林秀高等5人在1953年被蒋介石集团枪杀了。叶庆耀本人被关进火烧岛集中营。他说，在他所在的火烧岛集中营第十一大队，共有115人，其中大学生、高中学生就有48人，另外还有医师、工程师等。在第一大队和第三大队里，还有5个曾在解放前的上海交通大学、南京中央大学等任教的老教授。被囚禁在火烧岛集中营的人的“罪名”大多是所谓“思想偏差罪”、“触犯叛逆刑事罪”、“知情不报罪”等。
    叶庆耀说，台湾知识分子的生活极其困苦，除了薪俸低不足养家以外，失业成了他们很大的威胁。台湾大学工学院机械工程学系1952年毕业的学生一共有18人，其中林秀高被枪毙了，曾金海、陈德和、丘焕得、李深、叶庆耀5人几年来先后被关进监狱和集中营。其余12人毕业后只有3个人有职业。
