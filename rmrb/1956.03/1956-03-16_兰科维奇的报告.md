Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade dispatch: According to the Yugoslav News Agency, Belgrade, Ranković, a member of the Executive Committee of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, delivered a report on some issues related to the work of the League of Communists at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the League of Communists on the 13th.

Ranković said that at the end of 1955, the League of Communists had a total of 624,806 members. In that year, 24,889 new members were admitted, while 34,181 members were expelled. The majority of the newly admitted members were workers, accounting for 36.29% of the total. However, the number of worker members admitted to the League of Communists did not match the actual possibilities. He recalled that in the past six years, the League had expelled 273,464 members. The weakness of basic organizations in rural areas caused a passive attitude among many League of Communists members, who were then expelled in large numbers without in-depth analysis.

Ranković said that the work tasks of the League of Communists members are based on the premises adopted at the Sixth Congress of the League of Communists; according to this premise, the League of Communists is not, and cannot be, the direct work leader or organizer of economic, state, or social life, but must use its policies, its ideological work, and primarily persuasion to ensure that its line and the attitudes of its members are adopted. The work of the League of Communists members is concentrated on political work and the work of educating the working people in the spirit of socialism. He said: The organizations of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia at all levels have carried out their political activities in their past work through mass organizations, social groups, and social management institutions.

Ranković said that the principle of social management has become the driving force for the most extensive display of the initiative of the working people. In the workers' management committees of enterprises alone, there are more than 200,000 working people.

He pointed out that the development of social management has reached such a level that the previous organizational forms and working methods of the League of Communists can no longer fully meet the requirements put forward by social management to the communists. He said that it is very necessary to further develop the organizational forms and working methods of the League of Communists, thereby ensuring the political influence of the communists on the work and development of social management institutions.

Ranković said that the most active political activity of the League of Communists members is carried out in the Socialist Alliance, but despite this, there are still situations where the working people are not always able to understand the legitimacy and necessity of the measures taken to further develop socialism. In addition, various concepts incompatible with socialism have emerged. This situation has been used by the enemy to strengthen their activities by exploiting objective difficulties and subjective weaknesses. He recalled that under the new circumstances, various anti-socialist tendencies may manifest themselves in various ways. These tendencies are not the conscious tendencies of the remnants of the bourgeois reactionaries, but the various backward and suppressed ideas of the past that are currently breaking out and taking effect. The task of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia is to theoretically clarify many issues concerning the establishment of socialist relations based on the principle of autonomy.

    兰科维奇的报告
    据新华社讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社贝尔格莱德讯：南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟中央委员会执行委员会委员兰科维奇，13日在共产主义者联盟中央委员会全体会议上就有关共产主义者联盟工作的一些问题作了报告。
    兰科维奇说，在1955年年底的时候，共产主义者联盟共有624，806名盟员。那一年吸收了24，889名新盟员，同时开除了34，181名盟员。新吸收的盟员中大多数是工人，即占总数的36.29％。然而，共产主义者联盟吸收的工人盟员的人数并不符合实际的可能性。他追述说，在过去六年中，联盟开除了273，464名盟员。乡村的基本组织的软弱造成了许多共产主义者联盟盟员的消极态度，后来未经深入的分析就把这些盟员大批地开除了。
    兰科维奇说，共产主义者联盟盟员的工作任务是以共产主义者联盟第六次代表大会上所通过的前提为基础的；根据这个前提，共产主义者联盟不是，也不能是经济、国家或社会生活的直接的工作领导者或组织者，而必须以它的政策、它的思想工作、首先是通过说服工作去使它的路线和它的成员的态度得到采纳。共产主义者联盟盟员的工作集中在政治工作和以社会主义精神教育劳动人民的工作上面。他说：南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的各级组织在它们过去的工作中，通过群众组织、社会团体和社会管理机构开展了它们的政治活动。
    兰科维奇说，社会管理原则已经成为最广泛地发挥劳动人民的主动性的动力。单在企业的工人管理委员中，就有20多万劳动人民。
    他指出，社会管理的发展已经达到了这样的水平，以致共产主义者联盟以前的组织形式和工作方法不能再充分满足社会管理向共产主义者提出的要求了。他说，非常有必要进一步发展共产主义者联盟的组织形式和工作方法，从而确保共产主义者对社会管理机构的工作和发展的政治影响。
    兰科维奇在指出共产主义者联盟盟员最活跃的政治活动是在社会主义联盟中进行的时候说，尽管这样，还是有劳动人民并不是常常能够了解为了进一步发展社会主义而采取的措施的正当性和必要的情况。此外还出现了同社会主义不相容的各种概念。这种情况就被敌人用来加强他们利用客观困难和主观弱点进行的活动。他追述说，在新的情况下，各种反社会主义的倾向有种种可能表现出来。这些倾向不是资产阶级反动残余的有意识的倾向，就是目前正在爆发出来和发生作用的过去的各种落后的而受压制的观念。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的任务就是在理论上阐明根据自治的原则建立社会主义关系的许多问题。
