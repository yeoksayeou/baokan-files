Shandong Province's Handicraft Cooperative Successfully Trial-Produces a Batch of New-Style Farm Tools
　　Recently, some handicraft production cooperatives in Shandong Province have successfully trial-produced a batch of new-style farm tools. At the Handicraft and Local Industry Products Exhibition held in Weifang City in mid-February, eleven kinds of new-style farm tools newly made by handicraft production cooperatives were exhibited. Among them, the horse-drawn (also hand-cranked) chaff cutter can chop at least 3,300 catties of grain stalks per day with one person and one animal, which is nine times more efficient than the old-fashioned chaff cutter.
　　Luzhen Ironware Production Cooperative in Junan County, Linyi Prefecture, recently successfully trial-produced a wooden waterwheel. This waterwheel has a simple structure, low cost, and is also very sturdy. For example, if a hand-pressed waterwheel using wooden cylinders instead of iron pipes is used, one person can pump out 7.5 tons of water per hour, and the price per unit is 55 yuan cheaper than a Liberation-style waterwheel.

    山东省手工业合作社试制成功一批新式农具
    山东省一些手工业生产合作社最近试制成功了一批新式农具。二月中旬潍坊市举办的手工业和地方工业产品展览会上，就展出了手工业生产合作社新制的十一种新式农具。其中马拉（也能手摇）铡草机，一个人、一头牲口，每天至少可以铡谷草三千三百斤，比旧式铡刀提高效率九倍。
    临沂专区莒南县路镇铁业生产合作社最近试制成功了一种木制水车。这种水车构造简单，成本低，也很坚固。如用木筒代替铁管子的手压式水车，一个人使用，每小时能出水七吨半，价钱每部比解放式水车便宜五十五元。　（本报驻济南记者）
