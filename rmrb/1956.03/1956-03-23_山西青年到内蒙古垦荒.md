Shanxi Province's 1,040 young people have formed five reclamation teams to reclaim wasteland in the Hetao Administrative Region and Guyang County of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. They were selected from 60,000 young people who responded to the call of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League to sign up for wasteland reclamation. This group of young people comes from all over the province, including agricultural production cooperative directors, accountants, and agricultural technicians with rich experience in running cooperatives, as well as agricultural labor models.

Young people throughout the province used their savings and income from voluntary labor to buy more than 100 double-wheeled double-share plows, double-wheeled single-share plows, and new-style walking plows to send to the reclamation teams, and donated more than 160,000 yuan in cash. The youth of all circles in Taiyuan City held a grand send-off meeting for the youth volunteer reclamation team going to Inner Mongolia on March 18.

    山西青年到内蒙古垦荒
    山西省的1，040名青年组成了五个垦荒队到内蒙古自治区河套行政区和固阳县垦荒，他们是从响应青年团山西省委号召报名参加垦荒的六万名青年中选拔出来的。这批青年来自全省各地，包括具有丰富办社经验的农业生产合作社社长、会计和农业技术员，还有农业劳动模范。
    全省青年利用节约和义务劳动的收入，买了一百多部双轮双铧犁、双轮单铧犁和新式步犁送给垦荒队，并捐给现款十六万多元。太原市各界青年在三月十八日举行了欢送赴内蒙古青年志愿垦荒队大会。
