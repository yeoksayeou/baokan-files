    The Farmer's Beloved Friend – Wired Broadcasting
    Lǐ Zhǔn
    Before seeing it with my own eyes and hearing it with my own ears, I could never have imagined that wired broadcasting would be so welcomed and cherished by the masses in the countryside, and that it would wield such great power.
    Every day after dark in the rural areas of Xingyang County, Henan Province, the sounds of loud singing are everywhere. The singing comes from the valleys, from the riverbanks, and from village after village, as if the entire earth is singing. If you go into a village, you will see the flickering of pipe tobacco embers everywhere on the streets and in the houses, and clusters of dark figures gathered here and there. No one makes a sound, everyone is quietly listening to their beloved friend – the wired broadcasting loudspeaker – speaking and singing to them.
    The wired broadcasting system in Xingyang County was installed in December 1955 during the high tide of cooperativization. It began broadcasting on New Year's Day this year. On that day, I was in Sima Village. There had been a heavy snowfall the day before. Early in the morning, several elderly members of the agricultural producers' cooperative were sweeping snow on the street, planning to have a happy New Year. At this time, the wired broadcast that had just been installed on the pole the day before suddenly emitted thunderous singing: "The East is Red, the sun rises, China has produced a Mao Zedong..." The number of people on the street suddenly increased. Everyone shouted: "It's on! It's on!" In an instant, the street was crowded. The people sweeping snow also increased in number. People were sweeping snow, listening to the beautiful music and opera being broadcast. Gradually, they seemed to be intoxicated by the broadcast music, and holding their wooden shovels and brooms, they worked, laughed, and danced with the rhythm of the music.
    Farmers love music, and they love to sing their hearts out. During the high tide of cooperativization, they were in particularly happy and excited moods, and they urgently demanded cultural entertainment. An old woman named Hou Fengshi, who was over 60 years old, heard that the broadcasting had started and ran desperately to the street. When she was listening to the broadcast opera, she said to me: "In the future, take on some work, listen while doing it, this wired broadcasting is really socialism!" I told her that the benefits of socialism will be much greater than this in the future. She said with emotion: "Good, let's live a few more years! I won't be at a loss, Chairman Mao has let me see so many good things!"
    In Sima Village, wired broadcasting has become an important part of the masses' lives. When the sun sets, you will often hear this sentence: "Let's go listen to the broadcast!" Especially the elderly people in the village, they never miss either the daytime or nighttime broadcasts. They put some pieces of wood near the loudspeaker as their "permanent seats." An old man named Hou Shukuí is the grandfather of the director of the Sima Collective Farm. He is eighty or ninety years old this year, and has farmed all his life, but he has never ridden a train. When he heard the wired broadcast for the first time, he pointed to the wired broadcast loudspeaker, and then pointed to his ear under his hat and said: "This person has a loud voice, and sings and speaks clearly. Although my ears are a bit deaf, I can still hear so clearly." Young people told him: This is the sound broadcast by electricity. He said in surprise: "Electricity? I've never heard of it. This thing has such great power!" Then he said: "I have experienced the bad year of the third year of Guangxu, and the turmoil of the Republic of China. In the dozens of years, there have not been as many 'miracles' as I have seen in these few years! Last year I saw tractors plowing the fields, and this year I heard the electric broadcast."
    In the past, when the township cadres conveyed the county's reports, they always had to humbly say this sentence first: "My education is low, I can't remember everything, and I may convey the spirit of the report incorrectly..." Now, they are not afraid of "going astray." The responsible comrades of the county can sit at home and give reports to the township and village cadres and farmers throughout the county. On New Year's Day, Comrade Wang Lianqing, the secretary of the county party committee, gave a report on the radio to everyone about the cooperativization situation and policy explanation in the county. Recently, he also gave a report on the collectivization policy through wired broadcasting. After listening to the report, some district cadres and township cadres deeply felt that wired broadcasting is really convenient. Especially in the case of the rapid development of the cooperative movement, the opinions of the leadership can be transmitted to the districts, townships, and the masses in a timely manner, becoming a powerful weapon to correctly promote the countryside to advance towards socialism. In the past, for these two reports, if calculated according to convening an enlarged cadre meeting, the money for round-trip travel expenses and accommodation alone would cost 2,000 yuan, and it would also take up a lot of valuable time for many people.
      "With the installation of wired broadcasting, the atmosphere in the village has changed!" A township cadre said to me like this. What he said is not wrong at all. In the past, the streets and dining areas have never been so lively. The content of the conversations has never been so rich and vivid. They talk about the cooperativization situation in the county; they talk about the benefits of military service; they talk about the conditions for the state to reward labor models... The farmers' news is well-informed, and their knowledge has increased. The socialist atmosphere in the village is even higher.
    There is a member of the Sima Collective Farm named Hou Dehe. He is the blacksmith of the farm and also the head of the farm's rural theater troupe. He hammers iron next to the stove on the street every day, listening to the broadcast, and is so happy that he keeps singing along with the broadcast every day. When he was young, he would swing his hammer and play "Old Dragon Winding Around the Waist" and "Black Tiger Darting Under the Crotch" and other tricks; he hadn't played them for many years. Recently, when he listened to the broadcast, he became happy, picked up his hammer, and started playing again. He wrote a clapper rhyme for wired broadcasting:
    "Wired broadcasting is installed on the street, old and young men and women are smiling happily.
    You can hear the country's big news, and you can hear Chang Xiangyu's Henan opera.
    You can know when there will be a big wind, and you can know when to plant the land.
    Quickly increase support for national industrialization, and let the whole country install these loudspeakers!"

    农民心爱的朋友——有线广播
    李准
    在没有亲眼看到亲自听到以前，我怎么也想像不到，有线广播在农村这样受群众欢迎和爱护，发挥着这样大的威力。
    每天天黑以后，在河南省荥阳县的农村里，到处都是宏亮的歌声。歌声从山谷里传出来，从小河边传出来，从一个个村子里传出来，像整个大地都在歌唱。如果到村子里边，你会看到在街头和屋子里到处闪烁着星星点点的烟袋火光和这里一堆、那里一堆黑黝黝的人群。谁也不吭声，都在静静地听着他们心爱的朋友——有线广播的扩音器给他们说着、唱着。
    荥阳县的有线广播是在1955年12月合作化高潮中安装起来的。今年元旦那天开始播音。这天，我在司马村。前一天刚刚下了一场大雪。清早起来，几个年老的农业生产合作社社员都在街上扫雪，打算过个快乐的新年。这时候，街头的杆子上前一天才装好的有线广播突然发出了像雷鸣一样的歌声：“东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东，……”街上的人忽然多起来了。大家喊着：“响起来了！响起来了！”一刹时，街上人挤满了。扫雪的人也多起来了。人们在扫着雪，听着广播着的美好的音乐和戏曲。渐渐地他们像被广播音乐陶醉了似的，拿着木锨、扫帚，随着音乐的节奏，工作着，欢笑着，有起有落地翩翩舞动着。
    农民是爱好音乐的，是喜欢纵情歌唱的。在合作化高潮中，他们的心情特别愉快、兴奋，他们迫切地要求文化娱乐。有个60多岁的侯冯氏老大娘，听见开始播音，就拚命往街上跑。当她听着广播戏曲的时候，对我说：“以后拿点活，做着听着，有线广播这真是社会主义呀！”我告诉她，将来社会主义的好处比这还要多得多。她感慨地说：“好，再多活几年吧！我算不亏了，毛主席叫我见了好几样好东西了！”
    在司马村，有线广播成了群众生活中的重要内容。在太阳落山的时候，你会经常听到这一句话：“听广播去！”特别是村里的几个老年人，白天晚上两次广播，他们从来一次也不放过。他们在高音喇叭附近放了一些木头块，作为自己的“长期座位”。有个老头叫侯书魁，是司马集体农庄主任的老爷爷。他今年八、九十岁了，种了一辈子庄稼，到现在还没有坐过火车。当他第一次听到有线广播播音的时候，他指指有线广播扩音器，又指着自己帽子下面的耳朵说：“这个人嗓门大，唱的说的都清楚。我这耳朵虽然有点聋，可是还能听得这么清楚。”年轻人对他说：这是用电播送的声音。他惊奇地说：“电？没听说过。这东西这么大劲头！”接着他又说：“我经历过光绪三年坏年景，经历过民国年间的变乱。几十年来，也没有这几年见过的‘奇事’多！去年见了拖拉机犁地，今年又听到了电广播。”
    过去，这里的乡干部在传达县里的报告的时候，总要先谦逊地说这么一句话：“我文化低，记不全，可能会把报告精神传达走了样……”现在，不怕“走样”了。县里的负责同志坐在家里就可以向全县乡村干部和农民群众作报告。元旦那一天，县委书记王廉清同志在广播台上向大家作了个关于全县合作化情况和政策解说的报告。最近，他又通过有线广播作了个关于集体化方针的报告。听了报告以后，一些区干部和乡干部深深感到有线广播真是方便。特别是在合作化运动发展得这样快的情况下，领导方面的意见能够及时地传达到区、乡和群众中去，成为正确地推动农村向社会主义前进的有力武器。过去，像这两次报告，如果按召开一次扩大干部会计算，光往返路费和食宿用的钱，就得2，000元，另外，还要费许多人的好多宝贵的时间。
      “装上有线广播，村子里的空气都变了！”一个乡干部这样对我说。他说的一点也不错。往常，在街头上，吃饭场里，向来没有这样热闹。谈话的内容，也从来没有像这样丰富、生动。他们谈着全县的合作化情况；谈着服兵役的好处；谈着国家奖励劳动模范的条件……。农民们的消息灵通了，知识增加了。村子里的社会主义空气更加高涨了。
    司马集体农庄有个庄员叫侯德合。他是农庄里的铁匠，也是农庄里农村剧团的团长。他每天在街上的炉子旁边打着铁，听着广播，高兴得每天不住嘴地跟着广播唱。在年轻的时候，他抡铁锤还要玩“老龙缠腰”、“黑虎窜裆”等等花样；后来多年没有玩。最近，他听着广播的时候，高兴起来，就抡起大锤又玩起来。他为有线广播编了个快板：
    “有线广播街上安，老少爷儿们笑连天。
    能听国家的大消息，能听常香玉的梆子戏。
    能知道啥时候刮大风，能知道啥时候该种地。
    快加劲支援国家工业化，叫全国都安上这喇叭！”
