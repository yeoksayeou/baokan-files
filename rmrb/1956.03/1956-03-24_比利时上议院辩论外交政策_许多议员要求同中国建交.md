Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, March 22nd – The Belgian Senate has begun debating the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' budget for 1956. Many senators spoke on foreign policy issues.

	The budget report was presented by Senator Dehousse, who emphasized that one of the pillars of Belgian policy is "loyalty to the North Atlantic Treaty." At the same time, Dehousse stated that he agreed with the recent speech given by French Foreign Minister Pineau. Dehousse criticized the attempts of certain Western diplomats to exert pressure on Asian and African non-aligned countries.

	When discussing the People's Republic of China, Dehousse said, "The time has come to recognize Communist China because it is impossible to deny accomplished facts."

	On the issue of disarmament, Dehousse emphasized that "supervision of disarmament and disarmament itself must be implemented simultaneously."

	Senator Rolin (Socialist) in his speech called for a serious study of economic relations with the Soviet Union. He believes that the position of the North Atlantic bloc in Europe and around the world is weakening. He advocated for supervised disarmament.

	Rolin further recounted that many member states of the United Nations have advocated for the People's Republic of China to obtain its legitimate seat in the United Nations, and he went on to point out that despite this, the United States is still "arbitrarily delaying the resolution of this issue." Rolin expressed regret that Belgium's position is to follow the United States.

	Liberal Senator Moreau then spoke, and he also supported the recognition of the People's Republic of China. He said: The current position of the Belgian government is absurd. This position undermines the independence of Belgian foreign policy, and it also undermines Belgium's national interests because it deprives Belgium of access to a large market like the People's Republic of China.

	Communist Senator Noel spoke, saying that Belgium's foreign policy does not conform to the current international situation and does not take into account recent changes. Noel protested against "following the position of the U.S. State Department" at the expense of Belgium's national interests. He called for pursuing a truly Belgian, independent policy built on the foundation of defending world peace.

    比利时上议院辩论外交政策
    许多议员要求同中国建交
    新华社据塔斯社布鲁塞尔22日讯　比利时上议院已经开始辩论外交部的1956年度预算。许多议员就外交政策问题发言。
    预算报告是由上议员德乌斯提出的，他强调说，比利时政策的支柱之一是“忠于北大西洋公约”。同时，德乌斯表示他同意法国外交部长比诺最近发表的演说，德乌斯批评某些西方外交家对亚洲和非洲的未参加集团的国家施加压力的企图。
    德乌斯在谈到中华人民共和国的时候说，“现在是承认共产党中国的时候了，因为要否认既成事实是不可能的。”
    在裁军问题上，德乌斯强调说，“对裁军的监督和裁军本身必须同时实行。”
    上议员罗林（社会党人）在他的发言中要求认真地研究同苏联的经济关系问题。他认为，北大西洋集团在欧洲和全世界的地位正在削弱。他主张实行有监督的裁军。
    罗林进一步追述联合国的许多会员国曾经主张让中华人民共和国取得它在联合国的合法地位，他接着指出，尽管如此，美国仍在“专断地拖延这个问题的解决”。罗林对比利时的立场是追随美国这一事实表示遗憾。
    自由党上议员穆罗接着发言，他也赞成承认中华人民共和国。他说：比利时政府目前的立场是荒谬的。这种立场有损比利时外交政策的独立，并且，它也有损比利时的民族利益，因为它使比利时得不到像中华人民共和国这样大的一个市场。
    共产党上议员诺埃尔发言说，比利时的外交政策不符合目前的国际局势，没有考虑到近来发生的变化，诺埃尔抗议“遵从美国国务院的立场”而牺牲比利时的民族利益，他要求奉行一种建筑在保卫世界和平基础上的真正是比利时的、独立的政策。
