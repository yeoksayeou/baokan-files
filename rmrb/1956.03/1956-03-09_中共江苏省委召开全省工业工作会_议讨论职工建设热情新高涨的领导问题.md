The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a provincial industrial work conference from February 27th to March 5th, focusing on discussing the issue of strengthening leadership over the new upsurge of worker enthusiasm in participating in socialist industrial construction.

The meeting believed that currently, a new upsurge of worker enthusiasm for construction has begun to appear in state-owned factories and mines in Jiangsu Province, and in some local industrial factories. The broad masses of workers have, from the bottom up, exposed the right-leaning conservative thinking of the leadership, tapped potential, and formulated advanced plans. Workers at the Huaibei Salt Field criticized the conservative thinking of leading cadres, and 70% of the field's work areas guaranteed to complete the first Five-Year Plan this year. Workers at the Wuxi Diesel Engine Factory guaranteed to complete the cumulative figures of the first Five-Year Plan by mid-August this year. In a short period of time, workers' labor productivity has significantly increased. The Xuzhou Iron Factory, which manufactures new agricultural tools such as double-wheeled double-shared plows, has now seen more than 60 new production records. Rationalization proposals are also emerging in batches. Workers in three major workshops of the Changzhou Oil Cake Factory put forward 73 rationalization proposals, one of which suggested that simply changing the operating method could increase oil production by more than 110,000 jin per year. Not only workers are participating in the socialist competition, but also engineering and technical personnel, office staff, and cooks are getting involved.

Chen Guang, Deputy Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, pointed out in his concluding remarks on behalf of the Provincial Committee that this movement will soon take shape throughout the province. Leaders at all levels must continue to overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, stand at the forefront of the movement, lead the masses forward, and carry out socialist competition comprehensively and in depth.

    中共江苏省委召开全省工业工作会
    议讨论职工建设热情新高涨的领导问题
    中共江苏省委员会在2月27日到3月5日召开全省工业工作会议，着重讨论了加强对职工群众参加社会主义工业建设热情的新高涨的领导问题。
    会议认为，目前，江苏省国营厂矿和地方工业一部分工厂中开始出现了工人群众建设热情的新高涨。广大职工群众自下而上地揭露了领导方面的右倾保守思想，挖掘了潜力，制定了先进的规划。淮北盐场职工批判了领导干部的保守思想，全场有70％的工区保证今年就完成第一个五年计划。无锡柴油机厂职工保证在今年8月中旬完成第一个五年计划的累计数字。短期内，工人的劳动生产率已经显著提高。制造双轮双铧犁等新式农具的徐州铁工厂，现在出现了60多项生产新纪录。合理化建议也成批地涌现出来。常州油饼厂3个主要车间的工人提出合理化建议73条，其中有一条建议，只要在操作方法上改变一下，全年就可以增产食油11万多斤。参加社会主义竞赛的不仅是工人，工程技术人员、科室人员和炊事员等也动起来了。
    中共江苏省委副书记陈光代表省委会在会议上作总结时指出，这一运动不久就要在全省范围内形成。各级领导必须继续克服右倾保守思想，站在运动的前面，领导群众前进，全面地深入地开展社会主义竞赛。
