    Starting with Supporting and Promoting Advanced Things
    Gu Ming, Secretary of the CCP Committee of the Large Rolling Mill of Anshan Iron and Steel
    The work of Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Large Rolling Mill in discussing the 1956 national plan began with supporting and promoting advanced figures and advanced deeds among the workers, and mobilizing the workers to review the work of promoting advanced experiences and handling rationalization proposals in 1955. After the Party Committee of the Large Rolling Mill conveyed the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's instructions on opposing right-leaning conservative thinking and accelerating socialist transformation and socialist construction, the enthusiasm of the factory's workers quickly rose, and they began to consider how to guarantee the early and over-fulfillment of the Five-Year Plan with practical actions. Li Yuxiu, the foreman of the repair workshop, after actively studying and consulting with the workers in his team, proposed an advanced quick repair method. By using this method, the monthly machine and equipment repair time would be reduced from the stipulated forty-eight hours to thirty-six hours, and the country could increase its wealth by 10,000 tons of heavy rails annually. However, this valuable suggestion was resisted by some leading staff. Some people said, "Our factory now has a lot of time waiting for materials and waiting for heat, so shortening the repair time a bit doesn't mean much." Some people said, "Although Lao Li's suggestion is good, it's not our direction; the most important thing in repair work is quality, not speed." Some people even said, "Thirty-six hours is the international standard, we can't do it." In this way, Li Yuxiu's advanced suggestion was shelved.
    Li Yuxiu did not bow to difficulties. With the support of the workers, he submitted his suggestion to the Party Committee of the Large Mill. The Party Committee carefully studied it and organized technical forces to conduct an assessment, believing that the advanced working methods he proposed were feasible, and that the relevant leading staff's lack of attention to his suggestion and their failure to actively promote advanced experience were a concrete manifestation of right-leaning conservative thinking. If this right-leaning conservative thinking is not criticized and corrected, it will be impossible to formulate an advanced production plan and work plan; even if it is formulated, it will be impossible to achieve. Therefore, in addition to praising Li Yuxiu and deciding to support and promote his advanced working methods, the Party Committee also decided to closely integrate the inspection of right-leaning conservative thinking in the promotion of advanced experience by the leading departments with the discussion of the 1956 national plan.
    The Party Committee's decision was universally and warmly welcomed by the workers. The workers in various workshops boldly exposed the specific facts of the leadership's backlog of rationalization proposals and failure to promote advanced experience. In 1955, the committee for promoting advanced experience did not hold a single meeting. They also exposed the facts of individual inappropriate awards. The workers in the heating workshop and the rail steel workshop alone put forward more than 170 suggestions to the factory and workshop leaders. The Party Committee promptly studied the workers' opinions, and according to the opinions of the masses, strengthened the leadership of the work of promoting advanced experience, and urged the relevant parties to quickly handle the accumulated suggestions. In late February, the trade union convened a congress of all factory employee representatives. At the meeting, twenty-four advanced producers who had emerged in the past and present were rewarded; at the same time, the problems in the promotion of advanced experience were summarized, and opinions were put forward on how to carry out the rationalization proposal movement in the future to ensure the early and over-fulfillment of the Five-Year Plan.
    Since the employee representative congress, the work of proposing rationalization proposals and promoting advanced experience in the Large Mill has taken a step forward. The workers in various workshops are extremely enthusiastic about production, and the rationalization proposals and advanced experiences they propose for promotion are increasing day by day. The heating workshop only put forward a few rationalization proposals in the second half of last year, but in February of this year, it put forward more than seventy rationalization proposals. According to preliminary statistics from the entire factory, within two months after Li Yuxiu's advanced working method was adopted and promoted, the factory's employees put forward more than 400 rationalization proposals and advanced experiences for promotion, exceeding the total number for 1956. Li Yuxiu himself, under the leadership of the Party organization and the help of his comrades, further proposed a complete set of advanced working methods for equipment repair, solving the quality problems in repair work. He was therefore named an advanced producer in the factory, attended the Anshan City Advanced Producers Representative Conference, and will represent Anshan City at the Advanced Producers Representative Conference of the Ministry of Heavy Industry system in Beijing.
    Currently, the employees of the Large Mill are further tapping potential, proposing rationalization proposals, and using practical actions to ensure the over-fulfillment of the national plan. In order to strengthen the leadership of this work, the Party Committee has further launched the advanced producer movement in the discussion of the national plan. The trade union has established a mass-based committee for promoting advanced experience and formulated various regulations for promoting advanced experience. The factory's leadership is guiding the workers' high enthusiasm to solve the key problem of the factory—the quality of large-sized rail materials.

    从支持和发扬先进事物着手
    中共鞍钢大型轧钢厂党委书记　顾明
    鞍山钢铁公司大型轧钢厂讨论1956年国家计划的工作，是从支持和发扬职工群众中的先进人物和先进事迹，发动职工群众检查1955年推广先进经验和处理合理化建议的工作开始的。在大型轧钢厂党委会传达了中共中央关于反对右倾保守思想，加速社会主义改造和社会主义建设的指示以后，全厂职工群众的劳动积极性很快地高涨起来，纷纷酝酿怎样以实际行动来保证提前和超额完成五年计划。检修工段工长李毓秀，经过积极钻研并同本班工人商量以后，提出了先进的快速检修工作法。采用这个工作法，每月机器设备检修的时间，将从规定的四十八小时缩短到三十六小时，全年可以给国家增加一万吨重轨的财富。但是，这一可贵的建议遭到了一部分领导工作人员的抵抗。有的人说：“我厂现在待料、待热的时间很多，缩短一些检修时间不算啥。”有的人说：“老李的建议虽然好，但不是我们的方向；检修工作要紧的是质量，不是要求快速。”有的人甚至这样说：“三十六小时是国际标准，我们办不到。”就是这样，李毓秀的先进建议被搁置起来了。
    李毓秀没有向困难低头，他在工人的支持下把自己的建议提给了大型厂党委会。党委会慎重地作了研究，并且组织技术力量进行了鉴定，认为他提出的先进工作方法是可行的，而有关的领导工作人员不重视他的建议，不积极推广先进经验，是右倾保守思想的具体表现。这种右倾保守思想如果不加以批判和纠正，就不可能订出一个先进的生产计划和工作计划；即使订出来了，也不可能实现。因此，党委会除对李毓秀进行了表扬，决定支持和推广他的先进工作法以外，还决定把检查领导部门在推广先进经验中的右倾保守思想同讨论1956年国家计划的工作密切地结合起来。
    党委会的这个决定，受到职工群众的普遍热烈的欢迎。各个工段的职工们，大胆地揭发了领导上积压合理化建议，不推广先进经验的具体事实，1955年一年推广先进经验委员会没有开过一次会。同时也揭露了个别奖励失当的事实。仅加热工段和轨钢工段的工人，给厂方和工段的领导上提出的意见就有一百七十多件。党委会及时地研究了工人的这些意见，并且根据群众的意见加强了对推广先进经验工作的领导，督促有关方面迅速处理积压的建议。二月下旬，工会就召开了全厂职工代表大会。会上，对过去和现在涌现出来的二十四名先进生产者进行了奖励；同时还总结了推广先进经验中的问题，提出了今后怎样开展合理化建议运动、保证提前和超额完成五年计划的意见。
    职工代表大会以后，大型厂的提合理化建议、推广先进经验的工作已经向前迈进了一步。各个工段工人的生产热情异常高涨，他们提出的合理化建议和建议推广的先进经验，一天天地多起来。加热工段去年下半年只提出几件合理化建议，而今年二月份就提出了七十多件合理化建议。据全厂初步统计，在李毓秀的先进工作法被采纳推广以后的二个月内，全厂职工提出的合理化建议和建议推广的先进经验在四百件以上，超过了1956年全年的数字。李毓秀本人也在党组织的领导和同志们的帮助之下，进一步提出了一套完整的设备检修的先进工作法，解决了检修工作中的质量问题。他因此被评为全厂的先进生产者，出席了鞍山市的先进生产者代表会议，并将代表鞍山市出席北京重工业部系统的先进生产者代表大会。
    目前，大型厂的职工们正在进一步挖掘潜力，提合理化建议，用实际行动来保证国家计划的超额完成。党委为了加强对这个工作的领导，在讨论国家计划中进一步开展先进生产者运动，已经由工会成立了群众性的推广先进经验委员会，制定了推广先进经验的各项条例。厂的领导部门正在把职工群众高涨的热情引导到解决全厂的关键问题——大型轨材的质量问题上去。
