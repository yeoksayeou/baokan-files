    Let the Idea of Improving Product Quality Take Root
    By our reporters Ji Yin and Xi Ping
    The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Commerce No. 3, following the instructions of the Ministry of Commerce and the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, held a large-scale comparative exhibition of daily-use industrial products from February 18th to March 9th, displaying more than 1,500 kinds of daily-use industrial products produced by state-owned and joint state-private factories in Shanghai. The characteristic of this exhibition was the use of facts for comparison—comparing quality, comparing designs, comparing specifications, comparing costs—to support and commend enterprises that had made achievements in improving quality and increasing variety, and to sharply point out some of the problems that currently exist in the quality of Shanghai's daily-use industrial products, thereby encouraging factories with good product quality to continue to improve and promoting backward factories to learn from advanced factories.
    In the fourth quarter of last year, under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Shanghai enterprises launched a comprehensive campaign to improve the quality of industrial products, significantly improving the quality of 115 kinds of daily-use industrial products. The exhibition displayed these products in prominent places: Here are two different rickshaw tires. One is the old rickshaw tire of the past, which could only carry 400 kilograms; the other is produced by Shanghai Zhongnan Rubber Factory according to the opinions of the farmers, which can carry 800 kilograms. Farmers use it on carts as a means of transportation. In the first half of last year, the quality of cigarettes produced in Shanghai once declined, and after people from all over sent letters with opinions, the quality of cigarettes began to improve from the fourth quarter. Glass cups are popular in rural areas, but farmers reported that glass cups produced in Shanghai are prone to explode and have no handles, making it inconvenient to drink hot water. Now, a kind of explosion-proof hot water cup with a handle has appeared in the exhibition.
    The exhibition also contains a large number of new industrial products that used to rely on foreign imports but have been successfully manufactured by ourselves since liberation. These include various antibiotics and other precious medicines, dozens of hardware and electrical products, medical equipment, various cultural supplies and instruments, and other colorful daily-use industrial products. These new products have low cost and good quality. The antibiotic chlortetracycline, which was successfully trial-produced last year, fully meets international standards, and the cost is half lower than foreign imports. Aminopyrine, a drug that officially went into production in January this year, is estimated to save 17.5 million yuan in foreign exchange annually. Many new industrial products in Shanghai have not only been supplied to the domestic market in large quantities, but also exported to foreign countries.
    The quality of Shanghai's daily-use industrial products has greatly improved. However, the quality improvement of many products is very slow, and the quality of some products is unstable for a long time. The designs and varieties of some industrial products are outdated, far from meeting the needs of the country and the people. The exhibition adopted the method of comparison, placing products of the same variety but different quality from different factories together, so that people can see at a glance which factories are advanced and which factories are backward. For example, in the cultural supplies hall, five factories' No. 4 letterpress printing paper are displayed, among which the quality of the products of the joint state-private Minfeng Paper Mill is the best and the cost is the lowest, and the quality of the products of the Shanghai state-owned Lihua Paper Mill is the worst and the cost is high. Visitors standing in front of a mirror made of glass from Shanghai Yaohua Glass Factory see a "completely different face"; standing in front of a mirror made of glass from Shenyang Glass Factory, the face is lifelike. Using glass produced by Yaohua Glass Factory to make mirrors, defective products account for 50%, and each box of glass is 4 yuan more expensive than Shenyang Glass Factory.
    The exhibition not only pointed out some serious situations in the quality of Shanghai's daily-use industrial products, but also made a partial explanation of the reasons for this bad result by using the method of physical comparison. For example, two organs produced by the Shanghai Organ Factory have the same beautiful appearance, but when the keys are pressed, they emit two completely different sounds: one sound is elegant and moving, and the other is hoarse and low. The latter organ was made because in November 1954, in order to save copper, the factory mistakenly replaced the reed board, which was formerly made of copper, with zinc alloy. As a result, the reed made was brittle and lacked the melodious metallic resonance, and it underwent oxidation with changes in the climate. The reed became soft in hot weather and cracked in cold weather. By September last year, the factory had to restore the original material and recover the old products made of zinc alloy, with a total loss of 150,000 yuan. Shanghai's "Guoguang" and other famous brand harmonicas used to be welcomed by harmonica lovers all over the country. However, in the past one or two years, due to the harmonica factory's one-sided savings, the original copper shell was changed to zinc skin, 24 holes were shortened to 21 holes, and the hand grips at both ends of the harmonica were also shortened. As a result, the sound of the harmonica became hoarse, and many high-pitched songs could not be played after the sound holes were reduced, and it was not as convenient to use as before. People lost interest in it, and a large number of harmonicas were piled up in warehouses. It was not until November last year that the Shanghai harmonica factories changed this situation, using electrolytic copper to make reeds and adding new varieties. These several harmonicas before and after the improvement are now on display here, so that people can draw painful lessons from them.
    Doing a good job in the packaging of daily-use industrial products is an important task to protect the quality of products from damage. At the same time, it can also help consumers easily identify products and increase consumers' interest and aesthetic feeling in consumer goods. Doing a good job in packaging and implementing the principle of frugality are unified, but some factories go too far in making small calculations for "saving" on packaging. Many strips of cigarettes produced in Shanghai exhibited at the exhibition, the cigarette packaging paper in the past few years was printed with simple color patterns, but later it became worse year by year, the patterns disappeared, and finally it was wrapped in ordinary white paper with a small piece of trademark pasted on both ends.
    The exhibition also reflected an important opinion of the general consumers: the cost of some daily-use industrial products is too high, and the pricing is unreasonable. Here is a picture of a farmer holding two fat ducks, exchanging them for a toy duckling. The selling price of this small toy is 1.95 yuan, which is equal to the price of two live ducks. Here is a set of learning instruments necessary for students of engineering universities, a total of 6 pieces, selling for 66.05 yuan, many college students cannot afford it. The selling price of some drugs is also too high.
    "1956 should become a year of outstanding achievements in improving product quality and increasing product variety." This is a large slogan erected at the entrance of the exhibition. This idea was strongly conveyed to the tens of thousands of visitors during the exhibition, and aroused resonance among them. Many workers gathered in front of the exhibits to discuss and study enthusiastically. Many people carefully recorded the relevant issues in their notebooks one by one. After watching the exhibition, inspectors reviewed the shortcomings in the inspection work, and designers expressed that they would make new designs. People who used to be complacent about the famous brand products of their factory were also taken aback after seeing it. Many people said that they must immediately study the issue of improving product quality after returning, and believed that the exhibition made them more clear that improving product quality must be listed as the main content of the socialist competition. In half a month, the visiting masses put forward thousands of suggestions on improving the quality of daily-use industrial products. The exhibition office has compiled these suggestions into 7 large volumes, which will be distributed to relevant industrial departments for reference.
    This comparative exhibition of daily-use industrial product quality was a very ideological exhibition, which played a certain guiding and promoting role in the current upsurge of socialist competition that is forming in Shanghai factories. Through this exhibition, improving quality has formed a mass opinion in the relevant factories, which has played a promoting role for some backward units, and has made ideological preparations for the work of improving the quality of daily-use industrial products in various factories.

    让提高产品质量的思想深入人心
    本报记者　季音　习平
    上海市第三商业局根据商业部和中共上海市委的指示，从2月18日到3月9日，举办了一个规模很大的日用工业品质量比较展览会，陈列了上海国营、公私合营工厂出产的1，500多种日用工业品。这个展览会的特点是用事实作对比——比质量、比花色、比规格、比成本——的方法，支持和表扬在提高质量、增加品种方面作出了成绩的企业，尖锐地提出了目前上海日用工业品在质量上还存在的一些问题，从而鼓励产品质量好的工厂继续提高，推动落后的工厂向先进的工厂看齐。
    去年第四季度，在中共上海市委领导下，上海各企业曾开展了一次全面提高工业品质量的运动，显著地改进了115种日用工业品的质量。展览会把这些产品陈列在显著的地方：这里展出两种不同的人力车轮胎。一种是过去的旧人力车轮胎，它只能载重400公斤；另一种是上海中南橡胶厂根据农民的意见生产的，可以载重800公斤。农民们都把它装到板车上作运输工具。去年上半年，上海生产的纸烟质量曾一度下降，各地人民纷纷来信提出意见以后，从第四季度起纸烟质量就开始改进了。玻璃杯在农村里畅销，但是农民反映上海出产的玻璃杯容易爆炸，没有柄，喝热水不方便。现在，一种不易炸的、有柄的热水杯，已出现在展览会里。
    展览会里还有大量的过去依靠国外进口、而在解放后我们自己已经制造成功的新工业品。其中有各种抗生素和其他珍贵药剂，有数十种五金电器产品，药疗器械，有各种文化用具和仪器，以及其他五光十色的日用工业品。这些新产品的成本低，质量好。去年试制成功的抗生素金霉素，完全合乎国际标准，成本要比国外进口低一半。今年1月正式投入生产的药品胺基比林，每年估计可以节约外汇1，750万元。上海的许多新工业品不但已经大量供应国内市场，而且还远销国外。
    上海的日用工业品的质量已经有很大的提高。但是还有许多产品的质量改进得很慢，有些产品质量长期不稳定，有的工业品花色、品种陈旧，远远不能满足国家和人民的需要。展览会采取对比的办法，把不同工厂的品种相同但是质量不一样的产品放在一起，使人一看就知道哪些工厂先进，哪些工厂落后。例如文化用品馆里陈列着五个工厂出产的四号凸版印刷纸，其中以公私合营民丰纸厂的产品质量最好，成本最低，上海国营利华纸厂的产品质量最差，成本高。参观者站在用上海耀华玻璃厂的玻璃做的镜子面前，“面貌全非”；站在沈阳玻璃厂做的镜子面前，则面貌逼真。用耀华玻璃厂出产的玻璃做镜子，次货要占50％，而每箱玻璃比沈阳玻璃厂还贵4元。
    展览会不只是提出了上海日用工业品质量上的一些严重情况，还对造成这种恶果的原因，运用实物对比的方法，作了局部的说明。例如上海风琴厂出产的两部风琴，有相同的美丽外形，但是一按琴键，发出两种截然不同的声音：一种声音幽雅动听，一种声音沙哑低沉。后一部风琴就是因为在1954年11月，这个工厂里为了节约用铜，错误地把过去用铜制成的琴簧座板改用了锌合金，结果制造出来的琴簧质地松脆，没有了悦耳的金属共鸣声，而且随着气候的变化发生了氧化作用，琴簧热天发软，冷天开裂。到去年9月，这个厂只好恢复原来用的料，收回用锌合金做的旧产品，共损失了15万元。上海出产的“国光”等名牌口琴曾经受到各地口琴爱好者的欢迎。但是近一、二年来，由于口琴工厂片面地节约，把原来用铜的外壳改用了锌皮，24孔缩短为21孔，还把口琴两头捏手缩短，于是口琴声音变沙了，音孔减缩后很多高音曲子不能吹奏了，使用也没有过去那样方便了。人们对它失去了兴趣，大批口琴被积压在仓库里。直到去年11月，上海各口琴厂才改变这种情况，用电解铜做音簧，增加了新的品种。改进前后的这几种口琴，现在都展览在这里，让人们从这里吸取痛切的教训。
    做好日用工业品的包装，是保护产品质量不受损坏的一个重要工作，同时它也可以帮助消费者便于识别产品，增进消费者对消费品的兴趣和美感。搞好包装和实行节约的原则是统一的，但是有些工厂过分地在包装上去打“节约”的小算盘。展览会里展出的上海出产的许多条纸烟，前几年的纸烟包装纸上还印有简单的彩色图案，后来就一年不如一年了，图案也没有了，最后就是一张普通白纸包着，两头贴着一小块商标。
    展览会上也反映了广大消费者的一个重要的意见：目前某些日用工业品成本太高，定价不合理。这里有一幅画，画着一个农民抱着两只肥大的鸭子，在换一只玩具小鸭。这个小玩具的售价是1.95元，等于两只活鸭的价钱。这里有一套工科大学学生必备的学习仪器，共6件，卖66.05元，许多大学生买不起。有些药物的售价也太高。
    “1956年应当成为在提高产品质量和增加产品品种方面做出卓越成绩的一年。”这是竖立在展览会入口处的一幅大标语。这种思想，在展览会期间，强烈地传达给了几万参观的群众，在他们中间引起了共鸣。许多工人围聚在展览品前面热烈地讨论和研究。许多人把有关的问题一条条地细心记到本子上。检验员看了展览会以后，检讨了检验工作上的缺点，设计人员表示要做出新的设计。过去为本厂的名牌货而沾沾自喜的人，看了之后也大吃一惊。很多人表示回去后一定立即研究提高产品质量问题，认为展览会使他们更明确了必须把提高产品质量列为社会主义竞赛的主要内容。在半个月的时间中，参观的群众共提出了几千条关于改进日用工业品质量的建议，展览会办公室已经把这些建议整理印成7大本，准备分送给有关工业部门参考。
    这次日用工业品质量比较展览会是一次很有思想性的展览会，它对目前上海工厂中正在形成的社会主义竞赛的热潮，起了一定的指导和推动作用。通过这次展览，提高质量在有关工厂中已经形成了群众性的舆论，对某些落后单位起了推动作用，为各工厂改进日用工业品质量的工作，作了思想上的准备。
