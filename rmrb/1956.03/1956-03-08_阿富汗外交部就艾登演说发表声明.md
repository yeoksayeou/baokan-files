Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, 7th (TASS dispatch) - "Innovation Daily" and "Friendship Daily" published a statement by the Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman regarding British Prime Minister Eden's speech in the House of Commons on March 1st. Eden said that Pakistan seemed to have received all the rights of the British government on the Northwest Frontier of India (before partition) with the full consent of the majority of Pashto speakers. He also said that the British government fully supports Pakistan in maintaining its sovereignty east of the Durand Line. (The Durand Line, established in 1893, is the border between India and Afghanistan, which divided the territory of the Afghan tribes to the benefit of India, then under British control – TASS editor's note.)

The Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a statement that historical facts before the partition of Hindustan prove that the Durand Line placed Afghanistan in intolerable conditions. He said: "Afghanistan does not recognize the Durand Line as the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan."

The spokesman added: "The British government, on the one hand, declares that the Pashtunistan issue is between Afghanistan and Pakistan, and on the other hand, declares that it supports Pakistan. This statement will only intensify the situation and close the path to a peaceful resolution. The only effective way to solve this problem is to let the Pashtuns freely decide their own destiny."

    阿富汗外交部就艾登演说发表声明
    新华社7日讯  塔斯社喀布尔6日讯：“革新报”和“友谊报”发表了阿富汗外交部发言人就英国首相艾登3月1日在下院的谈话所发表的声明。艾登说，巴基斯坦似乎是在大多数说普什图语的人的完全同意之下，接收了英国政府在印度（分治以前）西北边境上的一切权利。他还说，英国政府完全支持巴基斯坦保持它在杜朗线以东的主权。（杜朗线是1893年确定的印度和阿富汗之间的边界，它割裂了阿富汗部落的领土，而有利于当时在英国控制下的印度——塔斯社编者注。）
    外交部发言人在声明中说，印度斯坦分治以前的历史事实证明，杜朗线把阿富汗置于不可容忍的条件下。他说：“阿富汗不承认杜朗线为阿富汗和巴基斯坦之间的边界。”
    这位发言人又说：“英国政府一方面声明普什图尼斯坦问题发生在阿富汗和巴基斯坦之间，而另一方面又声明它支持巴基斯坦。这种声明只会加强局势的紧张，封闭了和平解决问题的道路。解决这个问题唯一有效的途径是让普什图人自由决定自己的命运。”
