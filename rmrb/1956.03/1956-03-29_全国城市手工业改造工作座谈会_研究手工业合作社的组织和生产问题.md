Xinhua News Agency, March 28th: The National Urban Handicraft Transformation Work Symposium, convened by the Central Handicraft Administration and the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Handicraft Production Cooperative Joint Federation, studied several major issues currently existing in the cooperative transformation of urban handicrafts and proposed solutions.

    The symposium focused on the issue of centralized and decentralized production in handicraft production cooperatives, believing that the form of production should be organized centrally or decentrally, in accordance with the principles of benefiting production and serving the people, and in conjunction with the specific circumstances of the industry. In principle, manufacturing industries, because of their relatively high technical content, large degree of cooperation, and the fact that supply and sales often go through commercial channels, can be concentrated for production as long as conditions such as factory buildings, equipment, and cadres are in place, and after careful planning and thorough preparation. If the conditions are insufficient, or if there are more auxiliary laborers in the industry, and it is difficult to arrange them for a while after centralization, or if the products are sporadic and diverse, and the degree of cooperation is small, small-scale centralization or temporary decentralized production can also be carried out according to processes or varieties. Repair and service industries are generally suitable for decentralized production: for those with fixed production sites and storefronts, the original service points should be retained, and those that are unreasonable should be adjusted prudently after investigation and research; for those that originally provided door-to-door mobile services, the advantages of door-to-door service and convenience to the masses should be maintained and promoted to better serve residents; however, certain major repair links (such as spray painting and electric welding of bicycles) or industries that repair high-end products (such as repairing clocks and watches, radios, etc.) can be appropriately centralized without affecting consumer needs. The practice of blindly concentrating too early and too large, regardless of specific conditions, resulting in a decline in production and inconvenience to the masses, should be prevented and corrected.

    Regarding the supply, production, and sales issues of handicraft production cooperatives, the symposium proposed that handicraft production cooperatives should actively improve production technology, improve business management, and actively and steadily implement technological transformation to manufacture a large number of inexpensive, high-quality, rich and diverse handicraft products to meet the growing needs of urban and rural people for handicraft products. Therefore, in the process of cooperation, we must pay attention to the supply of raw materials and the promotion of products, preserve the original characteristics of handicraftsmen who care about the quality and sales of their products, and not interrupt the original supply and sales relationships and production cooperation relationships; those that have been interrupted should be actively restored; at the same time, grassroots cooperatives should be encouraged to actively expand new relationships based on the original production and sales relationships. In terms of product promotion, in addition to state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives processing orders and purchasing, handicraft production cooperatives should promote their products themselves. In order to uniformly arrange production and prevent blindness, state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives should sign contracts through local handicraft federations or specialized federations to organize production for the processing and ordering business of handicraft products. In terms of raw material supply, in addition to the state allocation and supply from processing and ordering departments, they must also purchase their own, and give play to the characteristic of handicrafts of "taking materials locally."

    In order to facilitate the unified arrangement of production by industry, carry out economic restructuring, and strengthen the leadership of handicraft cooperation, large and medium-sized cities and areas where handicrafts are concentrated must quickly establish and strengthen the institutions of specialized federations.

    The symposium also studied the issues of pricing of production materials and payment of shares in handicraft production cooperatives, and the protection of special crafts, and put forward suggestions for handling them. Everyone unanimously agreed that in cities that have basically achieved handicraft cooperation, in addition to continuing to deal with the problems left over from the establishment of the society, they should immediately shift to rectification, consolidation, and improvement work centered on production; other areas should continue to actively complete the organizational task of handicraft cooperation.

    全国城市手工业改造工作座谈会
    研究手工业合作社的组织和生产问题
    据新华社28日讯　中央手工业管理局和中华全国手工业生产合作社联合总社筹备委员会召开的全国城市手工业改造工作座谈会，研究了目前城市手工业合作化工作中的一些主要问题和解决的意见。
    座谈会着重研究了手工业生产合作社的集中生产和分散生产的问题，认为应该按照有利于生产和有利于为人民服务的原则，结合行业的具体情况，分别采取集中或分散的形式组织生产。原则上属于制造性的行业，因为技术性比较高、协作性比较大，而且供销多经过商业环节，因此只要厂房、设备、干部等条件具备的，经过周密规划和充分准备后，就可以集中生产。如果条件不够，或者行业中辅助劳动力较多，集中生产后一时不好安排的，或者产品零星多样，协作性比较小的，也可以按工序、按品种进行小规模的集中或暂时分散生产。属于修理和服务性的行业，一般适宜于分散生产：对于有固定生产场所和门面的，应该保留原有的服务点，其中有个别不合理的，要经过调查研究，再稳妥地进行调整；对于原有串街游乡流动服务的，应该保持和发扬上门服务、便利群众的优点，更好地为居民服务；但其中某些主要修理环节（如修理自行车的喷漆、电焊）或修理高级用品的行业（如修理钟表、收音机等），在不影响消费者需要的前提下，也可以适当地进行集中。不问具体条件，盲目过早、过大地集中，以致使生产下降、群众不便的做法，应该防止和纠正。
    对于手工业生产合作社的供产销问题，座谈会提出：手工业生产合作社应该积极提高生产技术，改善经营管理，并且积极稳步地实行技术改造，制造大量价廉物美、丰富多采的手工业产品，满足城乡人民对手工业产品日益增长的需要。因此，在合作化过程中，就必须注意做好原料供应和产品推销工作，保存原有手工业者关心自己产品质量和销路的特点，不能打断原有的供销关系和生产协作关系，已经打断的要积极恢复；同时要鼓励基层社根据原有的产销关系，积极扩展新关系。在产品推销方面，除国营商业和供销合作社加工订货和选购以外，应该由手工业生产合作社自行推销。为了统一安排生产，防止盲目性，国营商业和供销合作社对手工业产品的加工订货业务，应该通过当地手工业联社或专业联社统一签订合同，组织生产。在原料供应方面，除国家调拨、加工订货部门供给以外，还要自行采购，并且要发挥手工业“就地取材”的特点。
    为了便于按行业统一安排生产，进行经济改组，加强对手工业合作化的领导，大、中城市和手工业集中地区，必须迅速建立和加强专业联社的机构。
    座谈会还研究了手工业生产合作社的生产资料作价及股金缴纳、保护特种工艺等问题，并且提出了处理意见。大家一致认为：在已经基本上实现手工业合作化的城市，除继续处理建社工作中遗留下来的问题以外，应该立即转入以生产为中心的整顿巩固和提高工作；其他地区则要继续积极完成手工业合作化的组织任务。
