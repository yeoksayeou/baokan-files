    The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on the Resolution of the Model Charter for Agricultural Production Cooperatives
    (Adopted at the 33rd Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on March 17, 1956)
    On March 17, 1956, the 33rd Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress discussed the proposal and explanation made by Premier of the State Council Zhou Enlai on March 9 regarding the Model Charter for Agricultural Production Cooperatives. It was believed that the draft Model Charter for Agricultural Production Cooperatives passed by the 24th Meeting of the Standing Committee on November 9, 1955, had been proven to be practical through trial implementation in various regions and did not require further modification or supplementation. At the same time, the number of farmers joining agricultural production cooperatives nationwide had reached 85% of the total number of farm households, with members of advanced cooperatives accounting for approximately 60% of the total membership. There was an urgent need to pass the "Model Charter for Agricultural Production Cooperatives" without submitting it to the National People's Congress for discussion and approval, and a model charter for advanced agricultural production cooperatives should be formulated promptly. Therefore, it was resolved that the draft Model Charter for Agricultural Production Cooperatives passed by the 24th Meeting of the Standing Committee would be adopted as the formal charter in its original form.
    Xinhua News Agency, March 17th: The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress held its 33rd meeting on March 17th.
    The meeting discussed the proposal and explanation made by Premier of the State Council Zhou Enlai on March 9 regarding the Model Charter for Agricultural Production Cooperatives and resolved to adopt the draft Model Charter for Agricultural Production Cooperatives passed by the 24th Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress as the formal charter in its original form. This Model Charter for Agricultural Production Cooperatives has been promulgated today by order of the Chairman of the People's Republic of China, Mao Zedong.
    The meeting also approved and ratified multiple appointments and removals.

    全国人民代表大会常务委员会关于农业生产合作社示范章程的决议
    （1956年3月17日全国人民代表大会常务委员会第三十三次会议通过）
    1956年3月17日，全国人民代表大会常务委员会第三十三次会议讨论了国务院总理周恩来3月9日提出的关于农业生产合作社示范章程的议案和说明，认为1955年11月9日本会第二十四次会议通过的农业生产合作社示范章程草案，经过各地试用，证明是切合实际的，可以不再修改补充；同时，现在全国加入农业生产合作社的农户，已经达到农户总数的85％，其中高级合作社的社员约占社员总数的60％，急需通过“农业生产合作社示范章程”，不必再提请全国人民代表大会讨论通过，并且应当从速制定高级农业生产合作社的示范章程。因此决议：将本会第二十四次会议通过的农业生产合作社示范章程草案照原案通过，成为正式章程。
