Technical Night Schools in Rural Shanxi Province
Liu Jie

The Urgent Demands of Farmers
If tens of thousands of agricultural cooperative members cannot master advanced technologies, then any measures to increase production will not achieve their due effect.

Last year, the Xizhanggeng Agricultural Cooperative in Jieyu County, Shanxi Province, originally planned to apply granular fertilizer to the cotton fields once; however, cotton aphids occurred while the fertilizer was being applied. Originally, this problem was easy to solve; however, only Wang Yunsheng in the entire cooperative understood the technology. He had to prepare medicine and repair machinery, so where would he find the time to make granular fertilizer? The fertilization plan fell through.

Many young people in agricultural cooperatives, after increasing their socialist labor enthusiasm, feel distressed because they do not understand technology. They work hard in their labor, but the quality of their work is not high, and they cannot do some of the more technical work. Not only do they earn fewer work points, but other members of the cooperative also have opinions about them.

Improving technology is a problem that agricultural production cooperatives urgently need to solve.

How to solve this problem?

In the past, Shanxi Province used the method of teaching by region and area according to the agricultural season. This method did solve many problems, and it can still be used in the future. However, using only this form can no longer meet the needs of farmers after collectivization. They criticize this approach as being "piecemeal" and unable to systematically solve many specific problems in production. Shanxi Province has also used training classes to train technicians and directors of agricultural cooperatives. However, they say: Training classes are good, but too few people learn; and some people cannot take notes, so they forget everything when they go home. This method alone cannot meet the needs of the masses.

In some villages that achieved agricultural collectivization earlier, with the help of technical personnel, contracts for guaranteeing teaching and learning were established, and agricultural technology learning groups were established. By 1954, after agricultural technology extension stations were universally established in rural areas, agricultural technology learning groups further developed into agricultural technology night schools in many collectivized villages.

Once agricultural technology night schools were established, they were immediately warmly welcomed by the broad masses. In the spring of 1955, there were only fifteen in the province. By autumn, the number had increased to more than 1,200. The number of students enrolled increased, and their technical level also improved. Most of these students became promoters and implementers of advanced technologies. This created favorable conditions for implementing technological reforms on large areas of land. According to statistics from five technical night schools in Lu'an, Zuoquan, and other places: After the establishment of night schools, the area of ​​manual corn pollination increased from the original 110 mu to 2,390 mu, which alone could increase production by more than 45,000 jin.

Agricultural technology night schools are also powerful organizations for mobilizing the vast number of rural youths to march towards science. The youths of the Jiubei Village Agricultural Technology Night School in Hunyuan County, under the guidance of the agricultural technology extension station, not only learned technologies such as manual auxiliary pollination of corn, vernalization of potatoes, and the use of new agricultural tools, but also learned relatively advanced technologies such as endosperm grafting and asexual hybridization. They used these methods to graft 100 oat plants, asexually hybridize 50 potato plants, and bud graft 12 plants, and the yield increase effect was very significant.

It is necessary to do a good job in organization and ideological work.
To run agricultural technology night schools well, it is necessary to do specific organizational leadership work and meticulous ideological mobilization work.

In order to mobilize farmers to study at technical night schools, it is first necessary to use typical examples to publicize the role of science and technology in agricultural production, criticize the conservative and backward ideas of "farming requires no skill, just effort" and "farming does not require asking others, do what others do," and stimulate enthusiasm for learning technology. After the night school is established, attention should be paid to the students' ideological situation at all times, and problems should be discovered and resolved in a timely manner to prevent a decline in learning enthusiasm. Students with little or no literacy may feel that they cannot remember or keep up. During lectures, they should be properly taken care of, and students who are good at learning should be mobilized to help students who are poor at learning; it is best to form learning mutual aid groups on a voluntary basis based on production organizations. Women often think that they do less work in the fields and that they cannot use many of the technologies they have learned, and they need to be strengthened in education on participating in field labor. Some students are afraid that studying at night will affect their daytime labor and reduce their work points, and some leaders of the cooperatives are also afraid of affecting production. They should be made to understand that learning technology can improve labor efficiency, increase production, and increase income.

The rural Party and Communist Youth League branches should actively lead the agricultural technology night schools; in particular, the Communist Youth League branch should become the specific organizer and promoter of the technical night school. Agricultural technology extension stations should take on the responsibility of lecturing and training peasant technical instructors. Some staff members of technical extension stations believe that being a teacher will affect their technical extension work; this understanding is wrong. Facts have proved that agricultural technology night schools are one of the best ways for agricultural technology extension stations to educate farmers and promote advanced technologies. When students adopt new technologies, the management committee of the agricultural cooperative should give strong support and pay attention to stipulating reasonable remuneration; this has a great effect on encouraging students' learning enthusiasm and consolidating learning results.

In order to consolidate technical night schools, it is necessary to continuously improve teaching methods and improve teaching quality. Teaching must be closely integrated with current production, "learn what you do, do what you learn." Teaching plans should be made according to the local agricultural season; lectures and teaching should be conducted about ten days before the start of each agricultural production task. Before lecturing, teachers must prepare well, combine with typical examples as much as possible, and prevent turning some technical measures into boring things; specialized terms should be explained clearly in mass language. Lecture less, explain clearly, and thoroughly each time, and don't be greedy and cram. In order to help students remember and understand, draw more pictures and use more physical specimens. The Chengzicun Technical Night School in Fenyang compiled the cotton thinning and setting technology into rhymes, and the students said that it was easy to understand and remember, which greatly improved the teaching effect.

Textbooks and teachers are urgently needed.
There is now an urgent need for agricultural technology textbooks that suit the tastes of farmers. Agricultural departments in various regions should organize a group of agricultural technicians to compile popular agricultural technology textbooks.

To establish technical night schools extensively in rural areas, it is not enough to rely on the staff of agricultural technology extension stations alone. The current solution to this problem is to establish temporary workshops centered on the location of the agricultural technology extension station; half a month before the start of each important agricultural activity, teachers from each school go to the workshop to learn, and then go back to the village to teach. In this way, four or five technical extension stations in a county can basically solve the teacher problem for technical night schools.

Technical night schools can be run as part of spare-time cultural schools. The branch should make overall arrangements and unified arrangements for the time of political classes, cultural classes, and technical classes.

    山西省农村的技术夜校
    刘捷
    农民的迫切要求
    如果不能让成千成万的农业合作社社员掌握先进技术，那末，任何增产措施都不会起到应有的作用。
    去年，山西省解虞县西张耿农业合作社原计划往棉田内追施颗粒肥料一次；但是，正在追肥的时候发生了棉蚜。本来，这个问题很好解决；可是，全社只有王运升一人懂技术，他既要配药又要修理药械，哪有时间再造颗粒肥料呢？施肥计划就落空了。
    农业合作社里的许多青年，在提高了社会主义的劳动积极性以后，因为不懂技术而感到苦闷。他们在劳动中卖力不小，但是工作质量不高，某些技术性强的工作不会做，不但工分挣的少，别的社员对他们还有意见。
    提高技术是当前农业生产合作社迫切要求解决的问题。
    怎样解决这个问题呢？
    过去，在山西省曾经采用按农事季节分区分片传授的方法。这种方法确实解决了许多问题，今后还可采用。但是，只采用这种形式已经不能满足合作化以后农民的要求了。他们批评这种方式是“零打碎敲”，不能系统地解决生产中的许多具体问题。山西省也曾经采用开训练班的形式训练农业合作社的技术员和主任。可是，他们说：训练班好是好，就是学的人太少；而且有些人不会记笔记，回家就忘光了。光用这种方法也不能满足群众的要求。
    在某些较早实现农业合作化的乡村，在技术人员帮助下，订立了保教保学合同，建立起农业技术学习小组。到1954年，农业技术推广站在农村普遍建立以后，在好些合作化了的乡村，技术学习小组进一步发展成为农业技术夜校。
    农业技术夜校一经建立，立即受到广大群众的热烈欢迎。1955年春季，全省只有十五个。到秋季，增加到一千二百多个。入学的学员增加了，技术水平也提高了。这些学员大部分成为推广先进技术的宣传者和实行者。这就给在大面积土地上实行技术改革创造了有利条件。据潞安、左权等五个技术夜校统计：建立夜校以后，玉米人工授粉由原来110亩增加到2，390亩，只这一项就可以增产四万五千多斤。
    农业技术夜校同时还是动员农村广大青年向科学进军的有力的组织。浑源县旧裴村农业技术夜校的青年，在农业技术推广站指导下，除学会了玉米人工辅助授粉、马铃薯春化、使用新式农具等技术以外，还学会了胚乳嫁接、无性杂交等比较高的技术。他们用这些方法嫁接莜麦一百株，无性杂交马铃薯五十株，芽接十二株，增产效果都很显著。
    要做好组织工作和思想工作
    要办好农业技术夜校，必须做好具体的组织领导工作和细致的思想发动工作。
    为了动员农民到技术夜校学习，先要运用典型实例宣传科学技术在农业生产中的作用，批判那种“种地没巧，出力就好”和“种地不用问人，别人做甚你做甚”的保守落后思想，激发学习技术的热情。在夜校办起来以后，要时刻注意学员的思想情况，发现问题及时解决，防止学习情绪低落。识字不多或不识字的学员会感到记不住、赶不上，在讲课的时候要适当照顾他们，发动学习好的学员帮助学习差的学员；最好是在自愿的基础上以生产组织为单位组成学习互助小组。妇女往往认为自己下地劳动少，学了许多技术也用不上，需要对她们加强参加田间劳动的教育。有些学员怕夜里学习影响白天劳动，少挣工分，有些社的领导人员也怕影响生产。应当使他们了解：学会技术就能提高劳动效率、增加生产、增加收入。
    农村的党和青年团的支部，应当积极领导农业技术夜校；特别是青年团支部，要成为技术夜校的具体组织者和推动者。农业技术推广站要担负起讲课和培养农民技术教员的责任。有的技术推广站的工作人员，认为担任了教员会影响自己的技术推广工作；这种认识是错误的。事实证明，农业技术夜校是农业技术推广站教育农民推广先进技术的一种最好的形式。在学员采用新技术的时候，农业合作社的管委会要给以大力支持，注意规定合理的报酬；这对鼓舞学员的学习热情和巩固学习的成果有很大作用。
    为了巩固技术夜校，要不断改进教学方法，提高教学质量。教学要同当前生产密切结合，“学啥做啥，做啥学啥”。应当根据当地农事季节做好教学计划；在农业生产的每项工作开始前十天左右，就进行讲解和传授。讲课前，教员必须做好准备工作，多多结合典型实例，防止把一些技术措施讲成枯燥无味的东西；对于专门的名词术语，要用群众语言讲清楚。一次要少讲、讲清、讲透，不能贪多突击。为了帮助学员记忆和了解，要多画图，多用实物标本。汾阳城子村技术夜校把棉花间苗定苗技术编成顺口溜，学员都说这样好懂好记，教学效果大大提高。急需课本和教员
    现在迫切需要适合农民口味的农业技术课本。各地农业部门应当组织一批农业技术人员，把通俗的农业技术课本编写出来。
    要在农村广泛地建立技术夜校，单靠农业技术推广站的工作人员是不够的。当前解决这个问题的办法，是以农业技术推广站所在地为中心，建立临时的讲习班；在每项重要的农事活动开始之前半个月，各校教员到讲习班去学习，回村后再进行传授。这样，一个县有四、五个技术推广站就可以基本上解决技术夜校的教员问题。
    技术夜校可以作为业余文化学校的一部分来办。支部对于上政治课、文化课、技术课的时间要做全面安排，统一布置。
