    Domestically Produced Leica-like Camera

    A domestically produced Leica 3A-type camera was exhibited at the Beijing Municipal Industrial and Handicraft Products Exhibition. It was successfully trial-produced by the joint state-private Da Lai Precision Machinery Factory. Except for the optical glass lens element, which was imported, all 144 mechanical parts of the camera were manufactured by this factory. The materials for these parts were also domestically produced.

    Now, the Machinery Industry Company of the Third Local Industry Bureau of Beijing Municipality has decided to invest in this factory, adding workers and equipment for grinding lenses and importing optical glass, in order to further trial-produce and manufacture cameras.

    国产仿莱卡照相机
    北京市工业手工业品种展览会上展出了一架国产的仿莱卡3A型照相机。这是公私合营大来精机厂试制成功的。这架照相机除镜头部分的光学玻璃镜片是进口货以外，照相机的144个机械零件全部是这个工厂制造的。这些零件的材料也都是国产的。
    现在，北京市第三地方工业局机械工业公司已经决定在这个厂投资，增添磨制镜头的工人、设备和进口光学玻璃，以便进一步试制和生产照相机。
