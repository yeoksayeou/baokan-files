    Youth Afforestation Conference of Five Provinces (Regions)
    Telegram of Respect to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao

    Respected Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao:

    We, the 1,204 young men and women participating in the Youth Afforestation Conference of Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and Henan five provinces (regions), are pleased to report to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao that we have conscientiously studied the instructions given by the Party Central Committee to the conference, discussed the reports of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Ministry of Forestry, and the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, and exchanged experiences in afforestation and other soil and water conservation work. Each of us is encouraged by the bright future of our great motherland and filled with the will and determination to strive for the great cause of "greening the motherland."

    Thanks to the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we are doing a great undertaking that no one has ever done before. The people of our country will not only completely abolish the old social system, but also move towards the great goal of transforming nature. All the barren hills and wastelands of the motherland will be turned into green mountains and fields in our time, and the Yellow River, which has harmed the people for thousands of years, will be transformed to serve the people in our time. We are proud to be born in this great era and are determined to dedicate all our strength to this magnificent cause.

    The youth of Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and Henan five provinces (regions) are determined to launch a large-scale movement to green the Loess Plateau and comprehensively conserve soil and water in the middle reaches of the Yellow River. We must actively participate in building a green Great Wall stretching from southern Inner Mongolia, through Shanxi, northern Shaanxi, to western Gansu. We must plant trees and grass on all barren mountains and wastelands. We must also actively participate in various tasks such as water conservancy construction, terrace construction, dam construction and siltation, small reservoir construction, and improvement of farming methods. We firmly believe that as long as we work hard with the entire people in this way, we can not only rapidly increase crop yields, but also basically control soil erosion on the Loess Plateau in about 10 years, ensure that the Sanmenxia and other reservoirs can play a long-term role in flood control, and strongly support national industrial construction.

    The representatives of other provinces and cities (regions) attending the conference are determined to respond to the great call of the Party and Chairman Mao to "green the motherland," and to lead and organize the youth in their respective regions to plant forests and trees for different purposes according to the needs of national agricultural production and industrial construction, and according to the conditions of their respective regions. We must also plant various trees in a planned way next to all houses, villages, roads, waterways, and all possible barren mountains and wastelands that can be afforested. We firmly believe that as long as we work hard with the people of the whole country in this way, we will be able to make the land of the motherland green and the waters clear within 12 years.

    We know that there will be many difficulties in completing this huge task; however, we are the youth of the Mao Zedong era, and we will use hard work and persistent study to overcome all difficulties in our progress. We visited the places where the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao worked in Yan'an and heard about the great deeds of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao leading the people of the whole country in arduous struggles against Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, which made us deeply realize that every victory of the Chinese people's revolution and every achievement in the construction of the motherland have been achieved in overcoming difficulties. We must inherit and carry forward the revolutionary spirit of our revolutionary elders and use our hands to make the beautiful rivers and mountains of the motherland more beautiful and richer.

    As our conference closes, we would like to extend our highest respect to our beloved Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao with great admiration.

        The entire representatives of the Youth Afforestation Conference of Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and Henan five provinces (regions)
                                March 11, 1956, Yan'an

    五省（区）青年造林大会
    给党中央和毛主席的致敬电敬爱的党中央和毛主席：
    我们，参加陕西、甘肃、山西、内蒙古和河南五省（区）青年造林大会的1，204个青年男女，愉快地向党中央和毛主席报告，我们认真地学习了党中央给予大会的指示，讨论了青年团中央、林业部和黄河水利委员会的报告，交流了植树造林和其它的水土保持工作的经验，我们每一个人都为伟大祖国的美好的未来而欢欣鼓舞，都充满了为实现“绿化祖国”这个伟大事业而奋斗的意志和决心。
    由于有党中央和毛主席的英明领导，我们正在做着前人从来没有做过的伟大事业。我国人民不仅要彻底废除旧的社会制度，而且还要朝着改造大自然的伟大目标前进。祖国的一切秃岭荒原，要在我们这个时代里变成青山绿野，几千年来为害人民的黄河，要在我们这个时代里转而为人民服务。我们以生长在这个伟大的时代而感到自豪，决心把自己的一切力量贡献于这个壮丽的事业。
    我们陕西、甘肃、山西、内蒙古和河南五省（区）的青年，决心在黄河中游地区开展一个大规模的绿化黄土高原和全面保持水土的运动。我们一定要积极地参加营造从内蒙古南部起，经山西、陕西北部，到甘肃西部的一条万里绿长城。我们一定要在所有的荒山和荒地上种植起树木和牧草来。我们还要积极地参加兴修水利、修筑梯田、打坝淤地、修筑小型水库和改进耕作方法等各项工作。我们深信，只要我们和全体人民一道这样努力去做，我们不仅可以迅速地把农作物产量大大提高起来，而且将在10年左右的时间，基本上控制住黄土高原的水土流失，保证三门峡等水库能够长期地发挥拦洪作用，有力地支援国家工业建设。
    我们出席大会的其它各省市（区）的代表，决心响应党和毛主席的“绿化祖国”的伟大号召，带动和组织本地区的青年，按照国家发展农业生产和工业建设的需要，根据本地区的情况，分别营造不同用途的森林和树木。我们还要在一切宅旁、村旁、路旁、水旁以及一切可能绿化的荒山荒地上，有计划地种植起各种树木来。我们深信，只要我们和全国人民一道这样努力去做，我们一定能在12年之内，使祖国的大地无山不绿，有水皆清。
    我们知道，要完成这个巨大的工作，一定会有很多的困难；但是，我们是毛泽东时代的青年，我们将用辛勤的劳动和顽强的学习去冲破前进中的一切困难。我们这次在延安参观了党中央和毛主席工作过的地方，听到了关于党中央和毛主席领导全国人民跟日本帝国主义和国民党反动派进行艰苦斗争的伟大事迹，使我们深刻地认识到：我国人民革命的每一个胜利，祖国建设事业的每一项成就，都是在克服困难中取得的。我们一定要继承和发扬革命长辈的革命精神，用我们的双手，把祖国的大好河山，变得更加美丽，更加富饶。
    当着我们的大会闭幕的时候，我们怀着万分崇敬的心情，谨向我们敬爱的党中央和毛主席致最崇高的敬礼。
        陕西、甘肃、山西、内蒙古、河南五省（区）
          青年造林大会全体代表
                                1956年3月11日延安
