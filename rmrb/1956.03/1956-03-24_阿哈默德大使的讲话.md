Your Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen:

    Today, on the occasion of the founding of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, I would like to extend the fraternal greetings of the government and people of Pakistan to the great people of your country.

    The establishment of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan is the realization of the long-cherished wish and aspiration of 80 million people, and a milestone in Pakistan's progress along the road of political stability and constitutionalism; this road was charted nine years ago by the father of the nation, the great leader Muhammad Ali Jinnah.

    The constitution that comes into effect today fulfills the desire of the people of Pakistan to shape their lives in accordance with the enlightened, noble, tolerant and progressive ideals, and provides conditions for achieving the goal of improving the destiny of the broad masses of the people.

    Eight years ago, the great leader Muhammad Ali Jinnah laid down the principles governing Pakistan's relations with its neighbors and other countries in the world. He said: "Our foreign policy is one of friendship and goodwill towards all the nations of the world. We harbor no aggressive intentions against any country or nation. In state and international affairs, we believe in the principles of honesty and fairness, and are prepared to make the greatest contribution to promoting peace and the prosperity of all countries in the world. Pakistan will never stint to give material and moral support to all the oppressed and suppressed peoples of the world."

    These great ideals have always been the guiding principles of our relations with all countries in the world.

    Your Excellency: Your great country is our neighbor; since the dawn of civilization, the people of our two countries have had relations of common interest, and these relations have been greatly strengthened over time. Your country's rich and ancient culture has always been held in great esteem by us. The relationship that has existed for generations between the people of our two countries, strengthened in the pursuit of common goals, is a natural historical process.

    On this festive day, please allow me to recall the role that Pakistan, together with the People's Republic of China and other Asian countries, played at the historic Bandung Conference in seeking international peace and friendship, in ending exploitation and oppression, and in achieving greater unity and cooperation in international affairs.

    Our common desire to increase contact between the governments and peoples of our two countries has been realized through mutual visits of cultural delegations and mutual participation in various gatherings for the exchange of knowledge. The recent visit of Her Excellency Soong Ching Ling was a matter of deep gratitude and pride for the government and people of Pakistan.

    This respected lady is not a stranger to me. We feel very honored that she had the opportunity to personally experience the great respect and love that the Pakistani people have for the Chinese leaders, and their fraternal concern for the happiness and progress of the Chinese people.

    We are looking forward with pleasure to the visit of the Prime Minister of Pakistan to great China at the invitation of your government.

    This visit will further strengthen the existing relations and friendship between China and Pakistan.

    We are deeply pleased and honored that His Excellency Marshal He Long is attending the founding ceremony of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan as a special envoy of the People's Republic of China.

    Your Excellency, today, on the occasion of the founding of our Republic, we anticipate greater and closer cooperation between our two countries in realizing the ideals of Bandung.

    Your Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen, please join me in a toast to the friendship between China and Pakistan, and to the health and happiness of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the great nation!

    阿哈默德大使的讲话
    阁下，诸位女士们，先生们：
    今天当此巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国成立之际，我谨向伟大的贵国人民致以巴基斯坦政府和人民的兄弟般的问候。
    巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国的成立，是八千万人民的宿愿和抱负的实现，是巴基斯坦沿着政治稳定和立宪政体的道路前进的一个里程碑；这条道路是国父、伟大的领袖穆罕默德·阿里·真纳在九年以前所确定下来的。
    在今天开始实施的宪法，满足了巴基斯坦人民要按照开明、崇高、容忍和进步的理想去规划他们的生活的愿望，并且为实现改善广大人民命运的目标提供了条件。
    伟大的领袖穆罕默德·阿里·真纳在八年前确定了巴基斯坦与它的邻邦以及世界上其他国家间的关系的原则。他说：“我们的外交政策是一个与世界上所有的国家和睦友好的政策。我们对任何国家与民族都不怀有侵略的意图。在国务与国际关系上，我们信奉诚实与公平的原则，并且准备对促进和平与全世界各国的繁荣作最大的贡献。巴基斯坦将永远不吝啬地给予所有世界上被压迫和被镇压的人民以物质与道义的支持。”
    这些伟大的理想一贯是我们和世界上所有国家的关系的指针。
    阁下：伟大的贵国是我们的邻邦；从人类刚有文明的时候起，两国人民就已有着共同利益的关系，而这种关系，随着时间的推移，是大大地加强了。贵国丰富古老的文化，一直受到我们极大的崇敬。我们两国人民间世世代代存在着的关系，在追求共同的目标之中得以加强，乃是历史的自然过程。
    在这个节日里，请允许我追溯一下巴基斯坦同中华人民共和国以及其他亚洲国家在具有历史意义的万隆会议上为谋求国际和平与友好所起的作用，为结束剥削与压迫以及达致国际事务上更大的团结与合作所起的作用。
    我们为了增加我们两国政府与人民间的联系的这个共同愿望，已经通过文化代表团的相互访问以及彼此参加交流知识的各种集会而得到实现。最近宋庆龄阁下曾到我们那里作客，对于巴基斯坦政府和人民来说，都是我们所深为感激和引以为荣的一件事情。
    这位尊敬的女士对我并不是陌生人。我们感到非常荣幸的是，这次她有机会亲自体会到巴基斯坦人民对中国领袖们非常尊敬与热爱的感情，以及他们对中国人民的幸福与进步的兄弟般的关心。
    我们高兴地等待着应贵国政府邀请的巴基斯坦总理前来访问伟大的中国。
    这次访问将再进一步加强中、巴现存的关系和友谊。
    这次有贺龙元帅阁下作为中华人民共和国的特使，去参加巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国成立典礼使我们感到深为愉快和荣幸。
    阁下，今天，当我们的共和国成立之际，我们预期着我们两国为实现万隆理想而更大更密切地通力合作。
    阁下，女士们、先生们，请同我一起为中、巴两国的友谊，为伟大国家的伟大领袖毛泽东主席的健康和幸福而干杯！
