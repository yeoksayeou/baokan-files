Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 17th: On March 16th, the entire Polish people bid a final farewell to the great son of the Polish people, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Comrade Bolesław Bierut.

	The Polish capital, Warsaw, and the entire country were immersed in an atmosphere of grief. Polish flags draped with black纱 hung on every building. A large portrait of Comrade Beirut, adorned with a black border, hung high above the main entrance of the Central Committee Building of the Polish United Workers' Party. Comrade Beirut's coffin lay in state inside this building, and over the past 36 hours, hundreds of thousands of working people from across the country came to pay their respects.

	At 9:45 AM, representatives of the Soviet government delegation, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government delegation, as well as representatives from the Communist and Workers' Parties of 28 countries in Europe and Asia, including the People's Democratic countries, Yugoslavia, France, Britain, Italy, and Canada, arrived at the building to pay their final respects to Comrade Beirut.

	At 9:45 AM, Comrade Beirut's closest comrades-in-arms—members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party—arrived at Comrade Beirut's coffin to stand guard for the last time.

	At precisely 10:00 AM, Comrade Beirut's coffin was carried out of the building amidst mournful music and placed on a gun carriage. A Polish flag covered the coffin. Escorted by Polish military generals, the gun carriage proceeded towards the center of Warsaw—Stalin Square. Following behind were the leaders of the Polish United Workers' Party and the state, members of foreign delegations, representatives of the Polish working people, and diplomatic envoys and officials from various countries stationed in Poland. Tens of thousands of Warsaw citizens stood silently on both sides of the street, bidding farewell to their beloved leader.

	After the funeral procession entered the square, Polish military generals carried Comrade Beirut's coffin from the gun carriage and placed it on a hearse.

	At precisely 11:00 AM, sirens sounded in unison, and the orchestra played "The Internationale."

	Subsequently, the member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Worker's Party, Chairman of the State Council of the Polish People's Republic, Zawadzki, ascended the podium and announced the commencement of the memorial service on behalf of the Central Committee of the United Workers' Party, the State Council, and the government.

	In his address, Zawadzki said, "Bolesław Bierut has left us, but our Party, united as solid as a rock, continues to exist; the Polish People's Republic continues to exist, and is constantly consolidating and increasing its importance in the world; the great socialist ideals for which Bolesław Bierut fought with ardent passion continue to exist and are advancing victoriously throughout the world. Precisely for this reason, while speaking sorrowful words, we also make this oath: to protect the achievements of the Polish people as we protect our own eyes, to strengthen our beloved motherland—People's Poland, to strengthen the friendship of our people with the people of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all People's Democratic countries, as well as with the people of the world who are fighting for peace."

	Speeches were then delivered by: member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Poland, Cyrankiewicz, member of the Presidium of the National Committee of the National Front of Poland, S. Ignar, head of the Soviet government delegation, Khrushchev, head of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government delegation, Zhu De, and representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of other countries.

	At the conclusion of the memorial service, the band played the Polish national anthem.

	Then, to the sound of a funeral march, Comrade Beirut's coffin was placed on a gun carriage, and the funeral procession began to proceed towards the military cemetery. The streets along the way were still lined with tens of thousands of grieving workers. As the gun carriage carrying the coffin passed, people removed their hats and bowed. Many people could not help but shed tears.

	At 2:30 PM, the funeral procession entered the military cemetery. Leaders of the Polish United Workers' Party carried the coffin to a stone platform in the cemetery.

	Subsequently, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, E. Ochab, delivered a speech.

	After recounting Comrade Beirut's life and revolutionary activities, Ochab focused on the tasks facing the Party in the future.

	At 3:30 PM, Comrade Beirut's coffin was placed in the tomb. At this moment, a salute of cannons echoed across the cemetery. At the same time, a salute of cannons was also fired in Comrade Beirut's hometown, Lublin.
