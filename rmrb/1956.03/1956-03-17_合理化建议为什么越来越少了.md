Rationalization proposals at the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory are becoming fewer and fewer. In 1954, employees submitted a total of 757 rationalization proposals; in 1955, there were only 490; and in January of this year, only 33.

The leading staff at the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory are aware that rationalization proposals are decreasing. However, no one has ever investigated or researched the reasons for this important issue.

Many leading staff members at this factory frequently call on the masses to submit more rationalization proposals and to approach their work with a spirit of innovation. However, they have failed to effectively lead the rationalization proposal work. In the factory's technology department, there were originally three staff members dedicated to rationalization proposals. Last year, during the cadre reduction campaign, two were transferred away, leaving only Zhang Deyuan, a fourth-grade technician, who also handled expert work and the promotion of advanced experience. Not long ago, because Zhang Deyuan was handling three jobs and couldn't manage, an assistant technician was added, but in reality, it was still only one person dedicated to rationalization proposals. Since 1952, the factory has changed the full-time cadres responsible for reviewing and processing rationalization proposals submitted by the masses a total of 6 times. Among the administrative leaders, Deputy Chief Engineer Wu Yuanshan was nominally in charge of this work, but he even forgot that he was the deputy director of the Rationalization Proposal Committee, so it's difficult to talk about any concrete leadership. The other factory directors, because they weren't assigned to manage this work, naturally had even more reason not to pay attention to it.

Some leading staff members also believe that some rationalization proposals from workers are "a drop in the bucket" or "not technically strong enough" and do not support them. It usually takes one and a half to two months from the time a proposal is submitted to the time it is implemented. Many proposals have been "studied" for more than a year without any results, and some have even been lost. With such a cold attitude towards rationalization proposals from the workers, who would want to submit them again?

Since the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council issued the "Provisional Regulations on Rewards for Inventions, Technical Improvements, and Rationalization Proposals Related to Production" (hereinafter referred to as the "Reward Provisional Regulations") on August 28, 1954, this factory has never implemented them. In the factory's batch workshop, the pressure tools for the asbestos rollers of the glass drawing machine are bulky, and the workers' labor intensity is very high. Technician Zhao Jianwen and workers Chen Lazhu, Zhang Jiujiang, and others submitted a technical improvement proposal that could reduce the man-hours required for each piece from 12 hours to 2 hours and 54 minutes, increasing efficiency by 3.2 times, while also ensuring quality and reducing the workers' labor intensity. This technical improvement proposal saved a total of 763 man-hours. According to Articles 23 and 24 of the Reward Provisional Regulations, the proposers should be awarded a bonus of 78.4 yuan. However, the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory calculated the value of the savings too low and only awarded a bonus of 29 yuan. The Reward Provisional Regulations stipulate that the minimum bonus for a rationalization proposal shall not be less than 5 yuan, but this factory also failed to implement this provision. Originally, the errors they made in calculating the value of savings had already reduced the value of most rationalization proposals from over 50 yuan to below 50 yuan. In addition, for those with a savings value of less than 50 yuan and a bonus of less than 5 yuan, they used a towel, a vest, or a notebook, or praised them instead of giving the 5 yuan bonus that should have been given to the proposers. As a result, the opportunity to receive a bonus became even smaller for most employees. According to statistics from the first half of 1955, among the proposals that had been adopted, bonuses were only issued for 25.5% of the total number of adopted proposals. For the remaining nearly 75% who should have received 5 yuan, they only received towels, vests, or notebooks.

The errors made by the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory in the rationalization proposal work should be quickly corrected. Currently, the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory is enthusiastically carrying out a mass production campaign of "completing 12 hours of work in 8 hours." If the enterprise leaders can quickly correct their attitude towards rationalization proposals from employees, change the bureaucratic style of accumulating and delaying, and correct the errors in the reward work, the creative spirit of the masses will be fully developed, and the huge production potential hidden in the enterprise will be continuously tapped, which will further improve the factory's production level.

### 合理化建议为什么越来越少了

    合理化建议为什么越来越少了
    李谦生
    太原矿山机器厂的合理化建议越来越少了。1954年职工们提出的合理化建议共计757件，1955年只有490件，今年1月份只有33件。
    合理化建议减少了，太原矿山机器厂的领导工作人员也是知道的。但是，究竟是什么原因使得合理化建议减少了呢？对于这样一个重要的问题，却始终没有人去过问，也没有组织过任何的调查研究和检查。
    这个厂的许多领导工作人员，虽然经常在口头上号召群众多提合理化建议，用革新精神来对待工作，然而他们没有切实领导合理化建议工作。在工厂的工艺科里，原来有三个工作人员，专管合理化建议工作，去年实行干部定员的时候一下就抽走了两个，只剩下一个四级技术员张德源，还兼管着专家工作和推广先进经验的工作。不久以前，由于张德源身任三职实在顾不过来，才又增加了一个助理技术员，实际上仍然只是一个人专搞合理化建议工作。从1952年以来，这个厂审查和处理群众合理化建议的专职干部，一共调换了6次。行政领导人员中名义上由副总工程师吴元善分工领导这项工作，可是他甚至连自己在合理化建议委员会担任的副主任职务都忘记了，当然就很难谈到什么具体领导。其他几位厂长因为不分工管这个工作，当然就更有理由不加过问了。
    还有一些领导工作人员，认为工人的某些合理化建议是“远水解不了近渴”、“技术性不强”而不加支持。从提出建议到实现，通常需要一个半月到两个月时间。许多建议被“研究”了一年多还没有结果，有的甚至被遗失了。对职工群众的合理化建议如此冷淡，谁还愿意再提呢？
    自中央人民政府政务院在1954年8月28日发布“有关生产的发明、技术改进及合理化建议的奖励暂行条例”（以下简称奖励暂行条例）以来，这个厂从来没有执行。该厂成批车间压制玻璃引上机石棉滚子的压力工具笨重，工人的劳动强度很高。技术员赵建文和工人陈拉柱、张九江等提出一项技术改进建议。可使每件耗用的工时由12小时降低为2小时54分钟，效率提高三点二倍，而且保证了质量，减轻了工人的劳动强度。这项技术改进建议共节约763个工时，根据奖励暂行条例第23、24条规定折算，应该发给建议人奖金78.4元。可是太原矿山机器厂把节约价值计算的太低，只发奖金29元。奖励暂行条例规定，合理化建议奖金最低额不得少于5元，这个厂也没有执行这一规定。本来，由于他们在计算节约价值上所犯的错误，已经使多数合理化建议的节约价值由50元以上降为50元以下了，再加上他们对于节约价值不满50元而奖金不到5元的，又以一条毛巾、一件背心、一个笔记本，或是以表扬来代替应该发给建议人的5元奖金。这样一来，对于多数职工来说，获得奖金的机会就更少了。根据1955年上半年统计，在已经采纳的建议中，发给奖金的只占采纳总件数的25.5％，其余将近75％应该得5元的，都只得到毛巾、背心、笔记本。
    太原矿山机器厂在合理化建议工作上所犯的错误应该迅速纠正。目前，太原矿山机器厂正在热火朝天地开展“8小时完成12小时工作量”的群众生产运动，如果企业的领导人员能够迅速地端正对待职工合理化建议的态度，改变积压拖延的官僚主义作风，纠正奖励工作上的错误，群众的创造精神就会得到充分的发扬，企业中蕴藏着的巨大生产潜力就会不断地被挖掘出来，就会进一步提高该厂的生产水平。
