    Khrushchev Delivers Memorial Oration

    N.S. Khrushchev, head of the Soviet government delegation, delivered a memorial oration at the funeral service for Bolesław Bierut in Warsaw.

    Khrushchev said that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and all the Soviet people, together with the fraternal Polish people, felt deep sorrow over the death of our dear comrade and friend, Bolesław Bierut. Bolesław Bierut dedicated his noble life to the great cause of liberating the Polish people from capitalist enslavement and to turning Poland into a free, independent, democratic state of workers and peasants. The boundless radiance of the immortal doctrine of Marxism-Leninism guided all his selfless activities, and infinite loyalty to Marxism-Leninism and a high degree of principle have always been the main characteristics of Bolesław Bierut.

    Khrushchev then said that Comrade Bierut lived a brilliant life full of heroic revolutionary struggles. Years of experience in revolutionary struggle and a profound study of Marxist-Leninist theory made Comrade Bierut a great revolutionary, an outstanding activist in the Polish and international workers' movements, and a tireless fighter for the great cause of communism. The people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union and the working people of the whole world will never forget his active participation in the Polish and international revolutionary movements, as well as his significant role in establishing a people's democratic system and carrying out socialist construction in People's Poland; they will never forget his inestimable contribution to the establishment and consolidation of the great friendship of socialist countries.

    Khrushchev said that for the vital interests of the Polish people, Comrade Bierut constantly cared for strengthening the friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and Poland and developing close ties between the Polish United Workers' Party and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. We firmly believe that the bonds of sincere friendship and fraternal relations between the people of the Soviet Union and Poland will be further strengthened in the future.

    Khrushchev concluded by saying that while grieving together with our Polish brothers for the heavy loss we have suffered, we are confident that the Polish people will unite more closely around the Polish United Workers' Party and its Central Committee—the long-tested leader of the Polish people in their struggle for the freedom and independence of their motherland and for socialism. The name of Comrade Bolesław Bierut, the great son of the Polish people, will be forever recorded in the annals of the establishment of the new People's Poland as the name of an ardent patriot and a fighter for socialism and for the freedom and happiness of the Polish people. New achievements by the people of Poland, the Soviet Union, and other socialist countries in their great constructive labor, and new victories for the triumph of the lofty ideals of Marxism-Leninism, will be the best commemoration of our dear Comrade Bierut.

    赫鲁晓夫致悼词
    苏联政府代表团团长尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫在华沙举行的波·贝鲁特追悼大会上致了悼词。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联共产党和全体苏联人民同兄弟的波兰人民一起，对我们亲爱的同志和朋友波·贝鲁特的逝世感到深切的悲痛。波·贝鲁特把自己的崇高的一生贡献给了从资本主义奴役下解放波兰人民的伟大事业，贡献给了把波兰变成自由独立的、工农的民主国家的事业。马克思列宁主义不朽的学说的万丈光芒，指导了他的全部忘我的活动，对马克思列宁主义的无限忠诚和高度的原则性一向就是波·贝鲁特的主要特点。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，贝鲁特同志度过了充满英勇的革命斗争的光辉的一生。多年的革命斗争经验和对马克思列宁主义理论的深刻研究，使贝鲁特同志成为一个伟大的革命家、波兰和国际工人运动的杰出活动家，以及争取共产主义伟大事业的不懈战士。苏联各族人民、全世界劳动人民决不会忘记他在波兰和国际革命运动中的积极活动，以及他在人民波兰建立人民民主制度和进行社会主义建设方面的重大作用；永远不会忘记他对建立和巩固社会主义国家的伟大友谊所作的无法估计的贡献。
    赫鲁晓夫说，为了波兰人民的切身利益，贝鲁特同志不断关怀加强波苏两国人民之间的友谊以及发展波兰统一工人党和苏联共产党之间的紧密联系。我们坚信，苏联和波兰两国人民的真诚友谊和兄弟关系的纽带，今后将更加加强。
    赫鲁晓夫最后说，在和我们的波兰兄弟共同为我们所遭受的沉重损失而悲痛的时候，我们确信，波兰人民会更加紧密地团结在波兰统一工人党和它的中央委员会——波兰人民在他们争取自己祖国自由和独立、争取社会主义的斗争中的久经考验的领导者的周围。波兰人民伟大的儿子波·贝鲁特同志的名字，将作为热情的爱国者和争取社会主义、争取波兰人民的自由和幸福的战士的名字，永远载入建立新的人民波兰的史册。波兰、苏联和其他社会主义国家人民在伟大的建设性劳动中取得新的成就、为马克思列宁主义的崇高思想的凯旋而取得新的胜利，将是对我们亲爱的贝鲁特同志的最好的纪念。
