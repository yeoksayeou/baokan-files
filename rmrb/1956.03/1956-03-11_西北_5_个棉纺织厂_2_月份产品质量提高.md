The five state-owned and joint state-private cotton textile factories under the Northwest Textile Administration Bureau saw 17 yarn counts reach the new quality standards stipulated by the Ministry of Textile Industry in February. The total output value and the output of yarn and cloth of these five factories exceeded the state plan in February. Among them, the first-grade and first-class rate of 23-count yarn produced by the state-owned Northwest No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory increased by 20% in the second half of February compared with the first half of the month. The rate of first-grade cotton cloth in four factories also exceeded the state plan.

Last year, the product quality of these five factories failed to meet the plan month after month. Starting in February this year, workers in various factories enthusiastically engaged in the socialist competition with the focus on improving product quality. Weaving workers have generally promoted the "1951 Weaving Method" and the "Weft Changing Operation Method," which has greatly reduced the amount of substandard cloth. Many fine yarn workers have learned the advanced Soviet "Untwisting and Joining Method," eliminating and reducing the knots in joints. (Xinhua News Agency)

    西北5个棉纺织厂2月份产品质量提高
    西北纺织管理局所属的5个国营和公私合营棉纺织厂，2月份有17种纱支达到纺织工业部规定的新质量标准。这5个厂2月份的生产总值和纱布产量超过了国家计划。其中，国营西北第一棉纺织厂生产的23支纱，2月下半月一等一级等品率比上半月提高了20％。有4个厂的棉布上等品率也超额完成了国家计划。
    去年，这5个厂的产品质量月月完不成计划。今年2月开始，各厂职工热烈投入了以提高产品质量为中心的社会主义竞赛。织布工人普遍推行了“一九五一织布工作法”和“换纬操作法”，使次布大大减少。很多细纱工人学会苏联先进的“解拈接头法”，消灭和减少了接头的疙瘩。（据新华社讯）
