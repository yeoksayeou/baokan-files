Jordan

    The Kingdom of Jordan is located in the northwest of the Arabian Peninsula. It is bordered by Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Syria, and Israel. It covers an area of approximately 90,000 square kilometers and has a population of approximately 3.3 million. The capital, Amman, has a population of 170,000.
    Most of eastern Jordan is desert, while the Jordan River valley in the west is fertile and suitable for cultivation. The underground contains mineral deposits such as potassium phosphate, salt, and iron.
    Jordan was originally part of Palestine. After the First World War, Palestine became a British mandate. In order to facilitate the invasion of the people of the Middle East, the imperialists tried their best to provoke relations between Arabs and Jews, inciting conflicts, creating the so-called Palestinian problem, which brought profound disasters to the Palestinian people and seriously threatened the security of Arab countries and the peace of the Middle East.
    In 1922, Britain divided Palestine into two parts along the Jordan River, with the western part still called Palestine and the eastern part called Jordan. After the Second World War, amid the rising tide of national independence movements among the people of the Middle East, Britain was forced to recognize Jordan's independence in 1946.
    Jordan is now a monarchy. According to the constitution, legislative power belongs to the King and the Parliament. The King is also the commander-in-chief of the army, navy, and air force. The Parliament consists of two houses, the upper house having 20 members appointed by the King for a term of 8 years, and the lower house having 40 members elected for a term of 4 years.
    As a result of long-term colonial rule and plunder by Britain, Jordan is an economically backward agricultural country. The main crops are wheat and barley, followed by fruits and wool. It has no industry of its own, and most of the country's supplies rely on imports.
    After Jordan's independence, Britain still tried its best to maintain its military, political, and economic control over Jordan. As early as 1923, Britain established the so-called "Arab Legion" in Jordan. British officers took control of the command of this legion and used it as an important tool to control Jordan. In order to equip and train this army, Britain spends approximately $24 million annually. This money is used as a "loan" to Jordan, which Britain uses to interfere in and control Jordan's finances. In 1948, Britain forced Jordan to sign a military treaty, according to which Britain has the right to occupy two air force bases in Amman and Mafraq, and has the right to station and train British troops in Jordan, seriously infringing upon Jordan's sovereignty.
    Because Jordan is located in the key hub of the Middle East, Britain also attempted to use Jordan as a base to expand its aggression against Arab countries. In 1943, Britain created the so-called "Greater Syria Plan," attempting to expand Jordan's territory to the eastern coast of the Mediterranean, annexing Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine, so that the people of these countries would be enslaved by Britain. Recently, Britain and the United States have taken many measures to try to force Jordan to join the Baghdad Pact. American forces are also gradually infiltrating Jordan. In December 1951, the United States induced Jordan to sign the "Point Four Program" agreement. In May 1954, it signed the "Economic Aid Agreement" and proposed the "Jordan River Water Plan," attempting to use this to squeeze out British influence and invade Arab countries. Due to the fierce rivalry between Britain and the United States, Jordan's political situation is often unstable.
    The Jordanian people have long been engaged in the struggle against imperialism and for national independence. In 1953, nationwide demonstrations broke out throughout Jordan to fight for peace and against colonial enslavement. In June 1954, the Jordanian people held demonstrations against the Turkish-Pakistani military agreement. In the same year, Jordanian peace advocates organized a broad national front, proposing demands such as abolishing the British-Jordanian treaty, withdrawing British troops, and abolishing the "Point Four Program" agreement. In recent months, the Jordanian people's struggle for national independence and against joining the Baghdad Pact has become even more intense. When British Imperial Chief of Staff Templer went to Amman to force Jordan to join the Baghdad Pact, the Jordanian people launched a vigorous mass demonstration throughout the country, finally forcing the Majali government to resign.
    The people of Arab countries have also given strong support to the Jordanian people. Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia have announced their willingness to provide Jordan with financial assistance to help them get rid of British shackles. With the support of the Jordanian people and the people of Arab countries, the King of Jordan announced in March of this year the abolition of the position of Chief of General Staff of the Jordanian Army and Commander of the "Arab Legion" held by British officer Glubb. This is a new victory for the Jordanian people against the Baghdad Pact. It is also a new victory for the Jordanian people's united struggle against colonialism and for national independence.

    约旦
    约旦王国位于阿拉伯半岛西北部。国境四周同沙特阿拉伯、伊拉克、叙利亚和以色列接壤，面积约9万平方公里，人口约330万人。首都安曼有人口17万。
    约旦东部大部为沙漠地，西部约旦河流域土地肥沃，适于耕种。地下蕴藏着磷酸钾、盐、铁等矿产。
    约旦原来是巴勒斯坦的一部分。第一次世界大战后，巴勒斯坦变成了英国的委任统治地。帝国主义者为了便于侵略中东各国人民，极力挑拨阿拉伯人和犹太人的关系，煽起冲突，制造所谓巴勒斯坦问题，给巴勒斯坦人民带来了深重的灾难，也严重威胁阿拉伯国家的安全和中东地区的和平。
    1922年，英国以约旦河为界，把巴勒斯坦分为东西两部，西部仍称巴勒斯坦，东部称为约旦。第二次世界大战后，在中东各国人民争取民族独立运动高涨的形势下，英国被迫在1946年承认约旦独立。
    约旦现在是一个君主国。根据宪法规定，立法权属于国王和国会。国王兼任海陆空军总司令。国会由上下两院所组成，上院有议员20人，由国王指定，任期8年；下议院有议员40人，由选举产生，任期4年。
    由于英国的长期殖民统治和掠夺的结果，约旦是一个经济落后的农业国，主要作物是小麦、大麦，其次是水果、羊毛，自己没有工业，全国用品大都依赖进口。
    约旦独立后，英国仍极力保持它对约旦的军事、政治和经济各方面的控制。早在1923年英国在约旦建立了所谓“阿拉伯军团”。英国派军官掌握了这个军团的指挥权，并用它来作为控制约旦的重要工具。为了装备和训练这支军队，英国每年约花费2，400万美元。这笔钱被作为给约旦的“贷款”，英国就借此干涉和控制约旦的财政。1948年，英国又强迫约旦签订了一个军事条约，根据这个条约，英国有权占领在安曼和麦法拉克的两个空军基地，并有权在约旦驻扎与训练英国军队，严重侵犯了约旦的主权。
    由于约旦处在中东的枢纽地带，英国还曾企图以约旦为基地来扩大侵略阿拉伯各国。1943年英国曾制造了所谓“大叙利亚计划”，企图将约旦的版图扩张到地中海东岸，并吞叙利亚、黎巴嫩和巴勒斯坦，使这些国家的人民都受英国的奴役。最近，英、美两国又曾采取许多手段，企图迫使约旦参加巴格达条约。美国势力也步步渗入约旦。1951年12月，美国诱迫约旦签订了“第四点计划”协定。1954年5月又签订“经济援助协定”并提出了“约旦河水计划”，企图借此来排挤英国势力，侵略阿拉伯各国。由于英美两国的激烈角逐，约旦的政局常处于不稳定状态。
    约旦人民长期以来就进行了反对帝国主义、争取民族独立的斗争。1953年，约旦全国各地爆发了全国性的示威游行，为争取和平和反对殖民奴役而斗争，1954年6月，约旦人民又举行了反对土耳其—巴基斯坦军事协定的游行示威。同年约旦的和平人士组织了一个广泛的民族阵线，提出了废除英国—约旦条约、撤退英国军队、废除“第四点计划”协定等要求，最近数月以来，约旦人民争取民族独立、反对参加巴格达条约的斗争更加高涨。当英帝国参谋总长田普勒到安曼强迫约旦参加巴格达条约时，约旦人民在全国范围内掀起了轰轰烈烈的群众性的示威游行，终于迫使马加利政府辞职。
    阿拉伯各国人民也纷纷给予约旦人民以有力的声援。埃及、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯三国并曾宣布愿意给约旦财政援助，以帮助他们摆脱英国的束缚。在约旦人民和阿拉伯各国人民的支持下，约旦国王在今年3月宣布废除了英国军官格拉布所担任的约旦陆军总参谋长和“阿拉伯军团”司令的职务。这是约旦人民反对巴格达条约的新胜利。也是约旦人民一致团结反对殖民主义、争取民族独立斗争的新胜利。（厚）
