Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 3rd: The UNESCO Asian Regional Conference, which opened in Tokyo on February 28, closed on March 3. The closing meeting passed 30 resolutions. These resolutions will be submitted to the UNESCO General Assembly to be held in India this year.

    At the closing meeting, the Indian representative again requested that the resolution on the peaceful use of atomic energy include the content of "promoting education for the purpose of the peaceful use of atomic energy." Seven countries, including the Soviet Union, Indonesia, Burma, and Cambodia, supported discussing this proposal. However, 14 countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, voted against it.

    Subsequently, the Soviet representative again requested that the proposition of prohibiting the use of atomic weapons be added to the resolution. However, the chairman of the meeting, Tamon Maeda (Japan), unreasonably prevented this suggestion. The Soviet representative had already raised this suggestion at a group meeting on February 29, but due to the opposition of representatives from the United States, Japan, and other countries, this suggestion failed to pass.

    The Japanese Socialist Party and the Labour-Farmer Party have jointly protested against the Japanese government's opposition to the Soviet proposal. The two parties have decided to submit this issue to the Diet. They pointed out that the Japanese government's approach is contrary to the Diet's recently passed resolution against atomic weapons.

    联合国教育、科学及文化组织亚洲地区会议闭幕
    新华社3日讯  东京消息：2月28日在东京开幕的联合国教育、科学及文化组织亚洲区域会议，已经在3月3日闭幕。闭幕会议通过了30项决议。这些决议将提交联合国教育、科学及文化组织今年在印度举行的大会。
    在闭幕会议上，印度代表再次要求在关于和平利用原子能的决议中补充上“促进目的在于和平利用原子能的教育”的内容。苏联、印度尼西亚、缅甸、柬埔寨等7个国家支持讨论这个建议。但是，美国、英国等14个国家投票反对。
    接着，苏联代表再次要求把禁止使用原子武器的主张补充到决议中去。但是，会议主席前田多门（日本）无理制止了这个建议。苏联代表在2月29日的小组会议上就曾经提出过这个建议，由于美国、日本等国代表的反对，这个建议未能通过。
    日本社会党和劳农党已经联合抗议日本政府反对苏联建议的做法。两党决定把这个问题提交国会。它们指出，日本政府的这种做法是违背国会最近通过的反对原子武器的决议的。
