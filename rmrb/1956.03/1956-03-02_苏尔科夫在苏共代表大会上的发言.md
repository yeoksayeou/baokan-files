Comrades! Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev's report deeply moved everyone who heard or read it. It presented us with all the great achievements of our people under the leadership of the Party, between the 19th and 20th National Congresses, and marked the prospects for further advancement and consolidation of our socialist society. The report clearly explained the tasks of further struggle for communism. Relying on the people's trust, love, and unbreakable spiritual and political unity, the Party greeted its 20th National Congress with unprecedented unity. The collective wisdom and strong will of the Central Committee consistently guided the political, construction, and organizational activities of the Communists, enabling them to unswervingly realize the legacy of our great teacher Vladimir Ilyich Lenin.

The summary report of the Central Committee and the draft directives on the Sixth Five-Year Plan, published before the Congress, depict a magnificent vision of our future and point out a clear direction for each of us in the army of millions of communist builders. The Soviet intelligentsia, including writers and artists, stand together with workers and collective farmers in solving the tasks of realizing the new Five-Year Plan.

In the draft directives on the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the scale and growth rate of our literary and artistic products are not specifically determined by numbers, but the entire content of this document and the conclusion of Comrade Khrushchev's report make us clearly understand the increasing role of literature and art in the spiritual life of Soviet society in the coming years.

During the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the production of means of production and consumer goods will be greatly increased, the number of workers and staff in the national economy will increase to 55 million, and mechanization will make a more powerful offensive against agriculture. These are not only due to the further growth of the country's economic power, but also to the profound changes in the entire way of life of the people. When you think about the great construction tasks that the Party and the people need to solve in recent years, your heart will be filled with joy and pride! We must change the face of the regions where people have been accustomed to living since ancient times, make the awakened power of the atom an assistant to the people in peaceful constructive labor, and revive the vast areas of our eastern regions, which have never been touched and contain countless treasures, with a high degree of enthusiasm. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan, as in the previous years of socialist construction, literary and artistic workers will not lack ample and vivid life materials to create talented works needed by the people.

Soviet writers have never been cold annalists who are "indifferent to good and evil" and record the major and minor events in people's lives afterwards. At all stages of struggle and construction, Soviet literature has always used its best works to help the Party carry out the work of communist education for the working people, and it always keeps in mind that "whether it is a song or a poem - it is a bomb and a flag." The writers of all fraternal nationalities of the Soviet Union will make a hundredfold effort to fulfill the lofty tasks of literature in the Sixth Five-Year Plan. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the requirements of Soviet society for aesthetic treasures and our artistic treasures will be incomparably increased. In the face of this Five-Year Plan, with the huge growth of consumer goods, the wages of workers and staff and the income of collective farmers will be greatly increased. Shortening the working day will give millions of working people more rest time and cultural entertainment time. All this foreshadows a great increase in the people's demand for reading literary works, watching dramas, movies, and listening to music, and will lead to the widespread development of radio and television.

When considering our tasks in the face of the Five-Year Plan, we literary workers should especially estimate the huge scale of the improvement of the people's cultural level. In the era when universal seven-year education was implemented in our country, the requirements of readers and audiences for the ideological and artistic quality of literary and artistic works have already been significantly improved. In these years, our country has published hundreds of millions of copies of the works of domestic and foreign literary classics. After recognizing the examples of highly perfect art, the readers of these works are unwilling to tolerate the gray, mediocre, obscure style and rigid language of some modern writers' works. Therefore, we, Soviet literary workers, should especially firmly remember the following passage in Comrade Khrushchev's report: "Our art and literature can and should occupy the first place in the world not only in the richness of content, but also in the strength and skill of art. We cannot tolerate those obviously hastily written, boring and dull works, as some comrades in art groups, editorial departments and publishing institutions have done. Mediocrity and hypocrisy are often not sufficiently combated, which is detrimental to the development of art and the artistic education of the people."

What is the fighting power of today's literature in the face of new and great tasks? The Central Committee of the Party, in its congratulatory telegram to the Second All-Soviet Writers' Congress, pointed out the achievements of literature and the important position that literature occupies in people's lives. Comrade Khrushchev also spoke of the major achievements of literature and art in his report. However, we have no reason to be complacent. Originally, both the Central Committee's congratulatory telegram to the Writers' Congress and Comrade Khrushchev's report contained a clear warning: our literature and art lag far behind life, lag behind Soviet reality, and life and reality are much richer than they are reflected in art and literature.

Of course, literature has not stagnated. Hundreds of new books are published every year in the various fraternal republics. The "Soviet Writer" Publishing Bureau in Moscow alone published 104 new books in 1953, 131 in 1954, and 173 in 1955. In the years between the two Party Congresses, we wrote and staged dozens of new plays in our theaters. The number of new films produced based on the scripts of Soviet playwrights reached 65 in 1955. There has also been some progress in other aspects of literary activity. However, we have no right to ignore the fact that readers of many new books today are dissatisfied with the form and content of these new books; we have no right to ignore the fact that the modern-themed plays staged in theaters are insufficient, both in quantity and in artistic quality, and are often poor; we have no right to ignore, as Comrade Khrushchev correctly pointed out, "...in the pursuit of quantity, filmmakers often do not pay much attention to the ideological and artistic quality of films, and produce weak and superficial films that describe minor and insignificant phenomena." We have no right to continue to tolerate all these phenomena. We must, together with our comrades-in-arms - drama and film workers, together with composers, eliminate the backwardness of the Soviet art departments connected with literature in the shortest possible period of time, and give the people many talented, ideologically and artistically perfect works for drama, film and opera art, and give the people some excellent songs like those that appeared in large numbers in the pre-war years and during the war.

One of the important reasons for the current backwardness of literature is that a large part of the writers have weakened their connection with life and the creative activities of the people. The entire history of Soviet literature shows that powerful, ideologically and artistically valuable works can only appear under the pen of writers who have close ties with the life of the people. Gorky and A. Tolstoy, Mayakovsky and Bedny, Serafimovich and Furmanov, Leonov and Fedin, Sholokhov and Fadeyev, N. Ostrovsky and Gorbatov, Korneichuk and Krapiva, Mustafin and Kirbabayev, and many other excellent Soviet writers are like this. Works produced on the basis of a deep understanding of people's lives will always exist, and they will bring great social benefits not only to us, but also to our foreign friends.

For example, one cannot remain indifferent to reading the following passage in a letter from a rural correspondent published in the Romanian press. This rural correspondent wrote to the editorial department of a magazine saying: "We have decided to organize a collective farm. We had to carry out a serious struggle, and things progressed barely. Please send us 25 copies of Comrade Sholokhov's novel, 'Virgin Soil Upturned' as soon as possible." How the books containing the truth of the people's revolutionary struggle touch people's hearts!

In recent years, it is no accident that the names of some writers such as Ovechkin, Kochetov, Granin and Tendryakov have appeared in Russian Soviet literature, for example. The reason why their works are realistic is mainly due to the authors' connection with the labor collectives they write about.

Life itself shows that a writer who hopes to become a wise and popular advisor to our readers should stand at the forefront of communist builders himself. We also have some literary workers who still prefer to be satisfied with the comfortable and peaceful position on a light carriage. They also create some obscure works that distort the images of contemporaries and false life scenes.

Comrade Khrushchev said in his report that the Party has carried out and will continue to carry out struggles against phenomena that unrealistically describe Soviet reality, against attempts to whitewash reality, or, on the contrary, attempts to scold and obliterate the achievements of the Soviet people.

Not long ago, we waged a struggle in literature against those who whitewashed reality by creating false flattering and sycophantic works. Until now, the attitude of whitewashing reality has not been completely eradicated; the mentality of some editors and other personnel involved in literary work who are afraid to take responsibility has not been eradicated. This hinders our struggle for a truly socialist realist literature.

In the process of struggling against whitewashing reality and the theory of no conflict, many literary workers have developed a tendency to see everything around them as dim, and only use black, or at most gray, to depict reality. Some people try to leave the great themes of modern times and plunge into the world of personal emotions, trying to poeticize the emotions of the petty bourgeoisie, and under the guise of criticizing the remnants of capitalism, hiding the various "thaws" and dark corners of life accumulated in the hidden corners of our great world shrouded in the upsurge of constructive labor. The literary phenomena I am talking about absolutely do not refer to those works in which writers use sharp satirical weapons to carry out a real struggle against the real remnants of capitalism. This kind of work is needed by our young society, just like we need those powerful, sun-filled, and life-confirmed works.

For many years, when evaluating literary phenomena, we either over-praised or issued a noisy criticism of "blame," which greatly hindered the development of our literature. Not long ago, we had personally seen how generously bonuses were sometimes awarded to literary works. At that time, some obviously imperfect and not very artistic works, but only because of the reality of the theme, were awarded bonuses; at that time, there was a beneficial work, but it was not the best example, but it was awarded three bonuses - each one got one. In this case, it is difficult to convince writers that our line in the struggle for the high ideological and artistic quality of works is consistent. (Lively audience)

The backwardness of criticism and the extremely weak phenomenon of studying the theoretical issues of Marxist aesthetics are the great misfortunes of our literature. In the system of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, there are several research institutes specializing in the study of the history and theory of literature and language, and there is a strong philosophical research institute. These research institutes unite thousands of candidates for doctoral degrees and hundreds of doctors of science around them, and there are corresponding academicians and academicians. They have been compiling long-term plans and current plans for decades, but these research institutes have not written any important Marxist works that summarize the rich experience of Soviet literature for many years, nor have they written any fresh works on Marxist aesthetics. After being established for 20 years, the Gorky Institute of World Literature published a "Outline of the History of Russian Soviet Literature," but if you look at its content, you will feel that it is "much ado about nothing."

During the 38 years of the existence of Soviet literature, the Party has repeatedly given us concrete instructions. This is a sensitive, and it can be said that it is a motherly concern for the leadership of literature and art. This leadership combines the strict uncompromisingness of ideological wavering with the concern for the urgent needs of the future of literature. At the same time, the Party has always emphasized the particularity of literary activities. As early as 1905, V. I. Lenin raised the question of "literary work should be a part of the entire proletarian cause," he believed that it was necessary to emphasize that literary work was the least susceptible to mechanical averaging, "in this cause it is absolutely necessary to ensure a vast space for personal creativity, personal preferences, and a vast space for thoughts and fantasies, forms and contents." All the achievements of our literature should be attributed to Lenin's understanding of leading literature. Soviet writers have moved from the masses of the people to the peak of literary creation because of the victory of the great October Revolution, and they have become powerful because of the wise leadership and motherly care of the Party. They have gained the proud and pleasant right to talk to an unprecedentedly large number of listeners and readers of all nationalities - communist builders - because of their loyal service to the people. Comrade Gavrov, in yesterday's heated debate, severely accused us literary workers of not responding to the people's love. I think Comrade Gavrov is incorrect. Soviet literary workers have proved their loyalty to the socialist motherland with their excellent works and the fact that 250 literary workers shed their blood in the Great Patriotic War, and they have proved their deep love for our people like children to their mothers. (Applause)

14 months ago, the Central Committee's congratulatory telegram was read on this platform. The congratulatory telegram said: "The responsibility of Soviet writers is to create true art - an art with great thoughts and emotions, which deeply reveals the rich spiritual world of Soviet people, and embodies the labor of Soviet people and the social life and personal life in an inseparable unity in the image of characters."

We must firmly remember these words, and we believe that these words are a guide to action for every enthusiastic and thoughtful Soviet literary worker. We see and also know many shortcomings that hinder the progress of literature. With the help of the Party and the Central Committee of the Party, we will work together to eliminate these shortcomings, and make our multinational literature worthy of the people who are heroically building communism.

In front of the vanguard of the great army of communist construction, please allow me to recite a few lines of poetry by Mayakovsky on behalf of all our Soviet literary workers and each of us:
		I am with these people,
		They go out in the frenzy of continuous working days
		To build and clear.
		I praise the present of the motherland,
		But I praise three times – the future of the motherland.
		(Applause)

### 苏尔科夫在苏共代表大会上的发言

专栏：

    苏尔科夫在苏共代表大会上的发言
    同志们！尼基塔·谢尔盖耶维奇·赫鲁晓夫的报告，深深地感动了每一个听到或读到这个报告的人。在我们面前呈现了我国人民在党的领导下、在第十九次和第二十次代表大会之间所完成的全部伟大业迹，标示了我们社会主义社会进一步前进和巩固的前景。报告中清晰地说明了进一步争取共产主义斗争的任务。党依靠着人民的信任、热爱和牢不可破的精神上和政治上的一致，以空前的团结一致迎接了自己的第二十次代表大会。中央委员会的集体智慧和坚强意志一贯地指导着共产党员的政治、建设和组织活动，使他们始终不渝地去实现我们伟大的导师弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁的遗训。
    在中央委员会的总结报告和代表大会以前公布的关于第六个五年计划的指示草案中，描绘出我国未来的宏伟景象，给我们千百万共产主义建设者大军中的每一个人指出了明确的方向。在解决实现新的五年计划的任务时，同工人和集体农民站在一起的还有苏维埃知识分子，其中包括文学家和艺术工作者。
    在关于第六个五年计划的指示草案中，没有专门用数字来确定我国文艺的产品规模和增长速度，但是这个文件的全部内容和赫鲁晓夫同志报告的结论，使我们清楚地体会到在今后几年中文学艺术在苏维埃社会精神生活中的作用的增加。
    在第六个五年计划期间，生产资料和消费品的生产将要大大提高，国民经济中的工人和职员的数目将增加到5，500万人，机械化将对农业进行更加强大的进攻。这些不仅是由于国家经济威力的进一步增长，而且也是由于人民生活的整个方式发生了深刻的变化。当你想到，党和人民在最近几年中需要解决多么伟大的建设任务的时候，心中就会充满愉快和自豪！要把自古以来人们就住惯了的地区的面貌加以改变，要使那被唤醒了的原子的威力成为人们在和平的建设性劳动中的助手，还有那开垦我国东部从未触动过的蕴藏着无数财富的广阔地区并且使它复兴的高度热情。在第六个五年计划期间，同社会主义建设前些年一样，文学艺术工作者是不会没有充足的鲜明的生活素材来创造为人民需要的有才华的作品的。
    苏联文学家从来都不是那种“对善恶无动于衷”、事后把人民生活中的大小事件记录一下的冷淡的编年史的编纂人。苏联文学在斗争和建设的各个阶段都始终是以自己最优秀的作品帮助党进行对劳动人民的共产主义教育的工作的，它时时刻刻都牢记着， “无论是歌，无论是诗句——这是炸弹和旗帜”。苏联各兄弟民族的文学家都以百倍的努力来执行文学在第六个五年计划中的崇高任务。在第六个五年计划期间，苏维埃社会对美学珍品，对我们的艺术珍品的要求，将会无比地提高起来。在面临的这个五年计划中，随着消费资料的巨大增长，将大大提高工人和职员的工资以及集体农民的收入。缩短工作日将使千百万劳动人民有更多的休息时间和文化娱乐时间。这一切都预示出人民对阅读文艺作品、看戏、看电影和听音乐的要求将大大增加，并且将引起广播和电视事业的广泛发展。
    我们文学工作者，当考虑自己在面临的五年计划中的任务的时候，特别应当估计到人民文化水平的巨大规模的提高。在我国实行了普及七年制教育的年代中，读者和观众对文学和艺术作品的思想艺术质量的要求，就已经显著地提高了。在这些年里，我国出版了几亿册本国和外国文学古典作家的作品。这些作品的读者在认识了高度完美的艺术的范例以后，不愿意容忍某些现代作家作品的灰色、平庸、晦暗的风格和呆板的语言。因此，我们，苏联的文学工作者，应当特别牢牢记住赫鲁晓夫同志报告中的下面这段话：“我国的艺术和文学不但在内容的丰富上，而且在艺术的力量和技巧上能够而且也应该在世界上占第一位。我们不能容忍那些显然是仓促写成的枯燥乏味的作品，就像艺术团体、编辑部和出版机关的某些同志所作的那样。平庸和虚伪往往没有受到足够的打击，这是不利于艺术的发展和对人民的艺术教育的。”
    在新的巨大任务面前的现今的文学的战斗力怎样呢？党中央委员会在给第二次全苏作家代表大会的贺电中曾经指出文学所具有的成绩和文学在人民生活中所占有的重要地位。赫鲁晓夫同志在他的报告中也谈到了文学和艺术的重大成就。但是，我们没有任何理由可以自满。本来，无论在中央委员会给作家代表大会的贺电中，无论是赫鲁晓夫同志的报告中，都含有一种明显的警告：我们的文学和艺术大大落后于生活，落后于苏维埃的现实，生活和现实比它们反映在艺术和文学中的要丰富得多。
    当然，文学并没有停滞不前。每年在各个兄弟共和国都出版有几百种新书。仅仅莫斯科“苏联作家”出版局出版的新书，1953年就有104种，1954年有131种，1955年有173种。在两次党代表大会中间的几年里，我们写出了并且在我们剧院的舞台上上演了几十个新剧本。根据苏联剧作家的剧本摄制的新影片的数目，在1955年达到了65部。在文学活动的其他方面也有某些进展。但是，我们没有权利忽视今天的许多新书的读者是不满意这些新书的形式和内容的；没有权利忽视不论就数量和就艺术的质量来说，在剧院舞台上演出的现代题材的剧作都是不够的，并且常常是贫乏的；没有权利忽视像赫鲁晓夫同志所正确指出的“……电影工作者在追求数量的时候，往往不大讲究影片的思想和艺术质量，生产出描写细小的和没有重大意义的现象的无力而肤浅的影片”。我们没有权利继续容忍这一切现象了。我们必须同我们的战友——戏剧和电影工作者一起，同作曲家一起，在最短的时期内消灭同文学有联系的苏维埃艺术部门的落后情况，并且给人民以许多戏剧、电影和歌剧艺术用的有才华的、在思想和艺术上完美的作品，给人民一些像战前年代和战争期间大量出现过的优良歌曲。
    当前文学落后的重要原因之一是很大部分的文学家同生活、同人民的创造性活动的联系减弱。苏联文学的全部历史表明，强有力的、思想上和艺术上有充分价值的作品，只有在同人民的生活有密切联系的文学家的笔下才能出现。高尔基和阿·托尔斯泰，马雅可夫斯基和别德内依，绥拉菲莫维奇和弗曼诺夫，列昂诺夫和费定，萧洛霍夫和法捷耶夫，尼·奥斯特洛夫斯基和戈尔巴托夫，考涅楚克和克拉皮娃，穆斯塔芬和基尔巴巴耶夫以及其他许多优秀的苏联作家都是这样。在深刻通晓人民生活的基础上所产生的作品将永远存在，它不仅给我们，而且也给我们国外朋友们带来巨大的社会利益。
    例如，读到发表在罗马尼亚报刊上的一个农村通讯员的来信中的下面一段话，是不能无动于衷的。这个农村通讯员写给一家杂志的编辑部说：“我们决定组织集体农庄了。不得不进行严重的斗争，而事情进展得勉勉强强。请火速送给我们25部萧洛霍夫同志的小说，‘被开垦的处女地’。”包含着人民革命斗争的真理的书籍是怎样打动着人心啊！
    在最近几年中，例如在俄罗斯苏维埃文学中出现了像奥维奇金、科契托夫、格兰宁和田德里雅科夫这样一些作家的名字不是偶然的。他们的作品之所以具有现实性，主要是由于作者同他们所写的劳动集体的联系。
    生活本身表明，一个希望成为我们读者的聪明的和受欢迎的顾问的作家，他自己就应该站在共产主义建设者的前列中。我们也有一些文学家，直到现在还宁愿满足于轻重车上那种舒适而宁静的位置。他们也创造一些晦暗的、歪曲同时代人的形象和虚伪的生活情景。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在他的报告中说，党曾经进行了而且今后还要继续进行斗争，来反对不真实地描写苏维埃现实的现象，反对粉饰现实的企图，或者相反，企图责骂和抹杀苏联人民所取得的成就。
    不久以前，我们在文学中曾经同那些创造了虚伪奉迎的、阿谀谄媚的作品的粉饰现实的人进行了斗争。直到现在，粉饰现实的态度还没有完全根除；有些编辑和其他参与文学工作的人员的怕负责任的心理还没有根除。这妨害了我们争取真正的社会主义现实主义的文学的斗争。
    在同粉饰现实和无冲突论的斗争进程中，许多文学家产生了这样一种倾向，他们把自己周围的一切都看成是暗淡的，并且只用黑颜色，最多也是用灰颜色来描绘现实。有的人企图离开现代的伟大主题而投入个人感情的世界中，想把小市民的感情加以诗化，并且在批评资本主义残余的幌子下，掩藏起建设性劳动热潮笼罩下的我们伟大世界的隐蔽角落中积存的各种各样的“解冻”和生活中的阴暗。我所谈到的文学中的这种现象，绝对不是指作家们用尖锐的讽刺武器同资本主义的真正残余进行真正斗争的那些作品。这种作品是我们年轻的社会所需要的，也就像我们需要那些有力的，充满了阳光，为生活所证实的作品一样。
    许多年间，在评价文学现象时，我们或者是过分的赞扬，或者是发出批评性“责备”的喧嚷，这种情况曾经大大妨碍了我们文学的发展。还在不久以前，我们曾经亲眼看见，对文学作品有时是多么慷慨地颁发了奖金。那时，一些显然不完美的，艺术性不强的作品，但只是由于主题的现实性就获得了奖金；当时曾经有一部有益的作品，但并不是最好的榜样，却获得了三次奖金——每一部都得到一次奖。在这种情况下，很难使作家们相信，我们在争取作品的高度思想艺术质量的斗争中的路线是始终一贯的。（全场活跃）
    批评的落后和研究马克思主义美学的理论问题的极端薄弱现象，是我们文学的大不幸。在苏联科学院体系中，有几个专门研究文学和语言的历史和理论问题的研究所，有一个强有力的哲学研究所。这些研究所把几千个候补博士和几百个科学博士团结在自己的周围，有通讯院士和院士。它们几十年来都在编制远景计划和当前计划，但是这些研究所在很多年间并没有写出任何一部总结苏联文学的丰富经验的重要的马克思主义的著作，也没有写出任何一部关于马克思主义美学的清新的作品。高尔基世界文学研究所在成立了20年之后，出版了一部“俄罗斯苏维埃文学史纲要”，可是假如你看一看它的内容，那就会感到是“雷声大、雨点小”。
    在苏联文学存在的38年期间，党屡次给了我们具体的指示，这是对文学和艺术的敏感的、并且可以说是母亲般地关怀的领导，这种领导把严格地对思想上的摇摆现象的不妥协性，同对文学的未来迫切需要的关怀结合在一起。同时，党一向是强调文学活动的特殊性的。远在1905年，弗·伊·列宁就提出了关于“文学事业应当是整个无产阶级事业的一部分”这一问题，他认为必须强调文学事业最不能受机械的平均化的影响，“在这个事业中绝对必须保证个人创造性、个人爱好的广大的空间，思想和幻想、形式和内容的广大的空间。”我们文学的所有成就，都应当归功于列宁的这个对领导文学的见解。苏联作家是由于伟大的十月革命的胜利而从人民群众中走向文学创作的高峰的，是由于党的英明的领导和母亲般的关怀而变得有力的。他们由于忠实地为人民服务而获得了同空前众多的各民族的听众和读者——共产主义建设者——谈心的这一值得自豪和愉快的权利。加佛罗夫同志在昨天的激辩中曾经大肆责备我们文学家没有回答人民的热爱，我认为加佛罗夫同志是不正确的。苏联文学家曾经用他们的优秀作品、用250个文学家在伟大卫国战争时期流下自己鲜血的事迹，证实了他们对社会主义祖国的忠诚，证实了他们对我国人民的那种儿女对母亲般的深厚的爱。（掌声）
    14个月以前，在这个讲台上曾经宣读了中央委员会的贺电，贺电中说：“苏联作家的责任是创造真实的艺术——一种具有伟大的思想和感情、深刻地揭示苏联人的丰富的精神世界的艺术，以人物的形象来多方面地体现苏联人的劳动以及处于不可分裂的统一体中的社会生活和个人生活。”
    我们要牢牢记住这些话，我们认为这些话是每个热情的和有思想的苏联文学家的行动指南。我们看到而且也知道那些阻碍文学进步的许多缺点。我们在党和党中央委员会的帮助下，将同心协力地来消灭这些缺点，并且要使我们的多民族的文学无愧于英勇地建设共产主义的人民。
    在共产主义建设大军的先锋队的面前，请允许我代表我们全体苏联文学家和我们中的每一个人来朗诵马雅可夫斯基的几句诗吧：
    我同这些人在一起，
    他们在接连不断的工作日的狂热中出去
    建设和清除。
    我赞美祖国的现在，
    但三倍地赞美——祖国的将来。
                （掌声）
