Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement on the afternoon of March 12, condemning Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama for repeatedly making unconstitutional remarks in the Diet, permitting the United States to transport weapons for atomic warfare, and strengthening the "Self-Defense Forces."

The Socialist Party stated in its declaration that Hatoyama's recent repeated unconstitutional words and actions stem from the nature of the Hatoyama cabinet and its erroneous fundamental viewpoints. If such unconstitutional politics are condoned in the future, the Japanese nation's determination to resolutely strive for peace will suffer a setback, and it will inevitably lead to the implementation of conscription, the dispatch of troops abroad, and the revival of imperialism.

The Socialist Party said that the Japanese Constitution recognizes the state's inherent right—the right of self-defense—but does not recognize the maintenance of war potential and the state's right of belligerency.

The Socialist Party emphasized the direct relationship between Japan's security and the support of peace-loving countries, and believes that establishing a Far East security system including the United States and the Soviet Union is an effective way to prevent aggression.

    日本社会党发表声明
    谴责鸠山违反宪法的言行
    据新华社讯　东京消息：日本社会党在3月12日下午发表声明，谴责日本首相鸠山一郎最近在国会中一再发表违反宪法的言论，并且允许美国运来进行原子战争的武器和加强“自卫队”。
    社会党在声明中指出，鸠山最近屡次发生违反宪法的言行，是起因于鸠山内阁的性质及其错误的基本观点。如果今后默认这种违宪政治，日本民族坚决争取和平的决心将遭受挫折，并且必将导致实行征兵制、派兵出国和复活帝国主义。
    社会党说，日本宪法承认国家的固有权利——自卫权，但是不承认保持作战力量和国家的交战权。
    社会党强调日本的安全和爱好和平的各国人民的支持之间的直接关系，并且认为建立包括美国和苏联在内的远东安全体系是防止侵略的一个有效办法。
