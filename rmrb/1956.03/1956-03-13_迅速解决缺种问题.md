    Quickly Solve the Seed Shortage Problem
    Ji Xichen
    In many areas of Sichuan Province, the work of seed breeding and storage was not valued in the past. This year, the area of replanting has expanded, and the need for high-yield crops and early-maturing crop seeds has increased sharply, resulting in a serious shortage of seeds. Naxi County needs 1.7 million jin of early rice, but is still short 1.2 million jin. In Yanting County, 60% of agricultural cooperatives in the third district generally lack seeds. Because of the lack of early rice seeds, Pixian County was forced to reduce its original plan to plant 27,000 mu of double-cropping rice to 15,000 mu, and the county's grain production increase target had to be lowered as well.
    Recently, the agricultural leadership departments of Sichuan Province have distributed 13 million jin of fine seeds such as "Nante No.," "Ai Hongjiao," and "Yinfang Japonica Rice," transferred from Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui and other places, to the farmers one after another, but this still cannot meet the demand. To solve the seed shortage problem, it is still necessary to widely mobilize the masses to make mutual adjustments. After criticizing the idea of simply relying on state supply, Luxian County mobilized the masses to adopt methods such as "exchanging grain for seeds," "exchanging seeds for seeds," and borrowing seeds, and launched a seed exchange campaign throughout the county. The 55,000 jin of seeds adjusted by the members of a cooperative in Xuchang Township not only solved the seed shortage problem of the cooperative, but also adjusted 50,000 jin to other cooperatives. In order to solve the seed problem, the county also established an office for the promotion of fine seeds, and promotion groups were established in various districts and townships, specializing in the evaluation, identification, transfer, exchange, and supply of seeds, so that the difficulty of the county's shortage of more than 4 million jin of early rice seeds was basically solved.
    Actively breeding fine seeds is the fundamental way to completely solve the seed shortage problem. The Minjiang Agricultural Cooperative and the Xipu First Agricultural Cooperative in Guanxian County began to pay attention to the work of breeding fine seeds last year. They set aside a certain amount of land in the cooperative to cultivate and propagate seeds of rice, wheat, oil crops, and cotton, and initially achieved self-sufficiency in fine seeds. Some cooperatives in the Northeast Township of Pujiang County did not pay attention to seed retention and seed propagation, and simply relied on the state to supply fine seeds. As a result, the members ate all the early rice fine seeds, making it impossible to complete the task of planting double-cropping rice this year. These facts show that the establishment of seed land is very important for agricultural cooperatives, and all localities must pay attention to solving this problem in this year's production.

    迅速解决缺种问题
    纪希晨
    四川省许多地方，过去不重视种籽的繁育和储存工作，今年复种面积扩大，对高产作物和早熟作物良种的需要急剧增加，就发生了缺乏种籽的严重现象。南溪县需要早稻170万斤，现在还缺120万斤，盐亭县第三区有60％的农业合作社普遍缺种。郫县因为缺乏早稻种籽，被迫把原定的种植双季稻27，000亩的计划降为15，000亩，全县的粮食增产指标也不得不降低。
    最近四川省农业领导部门，把从湖南、江西、安徽等地调来的1，300万斤“南特号”“矮红脚”“银坊粳稻”等良种，先后分到农民手中，但是仍不能满足需要。要解决缺种问题，还必须广泛发动群众相互调剂。泸县在批判了单纯依赖国家供应的思想以后，发动群众采取“以粮换种”、“以种换种”和借种的办法，在全县范围内开展了换种运动。徐场乡一社社员调剂出的55，000斤种籽，不但解决了本社的缺种问题，还调剂出5万斤给别的社。为了解决种籽问题，这个县还成立了推广良种办公室，各区、乡建立了推广组，专门负责种籽的评选鉴定、调运、调换、供应等工作，使全县缺少400多万斤早稻种籽的困难问题基本上得到了解决。
    积极繁育良种，是彻底解决缺种问题的根本途径。灌县岷江农业合作社和西浦第一农业合作社，从去年起就开始注意繁育良种的工作，在社内抽出一定的土地，用来培育繁殖水稻、麦子、油料和棉花种籽，初步做到了良种自给。蒲江县东北乡有些社，不注意留种和繁殖种籽，单纯依赖国家供应良种，结果，社员全部吃光了早稻良种，致使今年无法完成播种双季稻的任务。这些事实说明：建立种籽地，对于农业合作社是很重要的，各地在今年的生产中，必须注意解决这个问题。
