    Shanxi's more than 13 million mu of wheat seedlings, which have been universally harrowed, rolled, and compacted, are now a lush green. In the past few days, agricultural producers' cooperatives in 37 counties of the Jinnan Basin and Changzhi Special District have applied topdressing fertilizer to more than 4.3 million mu of wheat fields, with an average application rate of more than 3,000 jin per mu, double that of previous years.
    After the realization of agricultural cooperation throughout the province this year, farmers have extensively selected cold-resistant improved varieties, implemented close planting, and increased the application of base fertilizer. Since the beginning of spring, various localities have also proposed carrying out wheat field management and frost prevention preparations for twenty days to prevent winter wheat from suffering frost damage.

    山西麦苗一片葱绿
    山西省经过普遍耙、耱和镇压过的一千三百多万亩麦苗，现在一片葱绿。最近几天，晋南盆地和长治专区37个县的农业生产合作社已经在四百三十多万亩麦地里施追肥，每亩施肥量平均达三千多斤，比往年增加一倍。
    今年全省农业实现合作化以后，农民们大量选用抗寒良种、实行密植和增施底肥。入春以来，各地又提出二十天开展麦田管理和防冻准备，防止冬小麦遭受冻灾。（据新华社讯）
