    The construction of the northern trunk canal project in Dunhuang County, Gansu Province, which will draw water from the Dang River to irrigate the new cotton-growing area, has begun.

    A type of high-wheeled cart suitable for traveling on deserts, Gobi, and saline-alkali land is now transporting stone materials needed for the project day and night from the Gobi Desert, dozens of miles away.

    The northern trunk canal is more than sixty *li* long. More than twenty weirs, eight diversion gates, and six large bridges passable by tractors will be built on the canal. The entire project will be completed in July this year. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    敦煌县北干渠开工
    甘肃省敦煌县境内引党河水灌溉新棉区的北干渠工程已经开工了。
    一种便于在沙漠、戈壁和泛浆地上行车的高轮大车，现在正在从几十里外的戈壁滩，向工地夜以继日地运送工程所需的石料。
    北干渠长达六十多里。渠道上要修二十几个跌水、八座分水闸和六座可通行拖拉机的大桥。全部工程今年七月就可完成。　（据新华社讯）
