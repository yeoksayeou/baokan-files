    Helping Vagrants Become a Force for Building Socialism
    Xinhua News Agency: The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the People's Republic of China recently held a conference in Beijing on the transformation of vagrants, focusing on discussing and studying the issue of urban vagrant transformation.

    Chen Qiyuan, Vice Minister of Internal Affairs, delivered a report on the work of vagrant transformation at the meeting. In his report, he pointed out that the criminal rule of old China created a large number of vagrants. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the People's Government and the people have helped a large number of vagrants to be transformed through labor. At present, the vagrants in rural areas have been basically transformed into laborers. The report then stated: This vagrant transformation work conference was convened under the circumstances of the development of our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation, which requires "everyone to get their due place." Therefore, it is necessary to accelerate helping vagrants in cities to find employment so that they can become a force for building socialism.

    The conference determined the guiding principle for the work of vagrant transformation. This principle is "combining transformation with resettlement." That is, to place vagrants in labor production positions, urge them to learn the skills of labor production, develop the habit of labor, and be able to support themselves with their own strength, thereby achieving the goal of transformation. Therefore, transforming and resettling vagrants means organizing vagrants to participate in production.

    The conference believes that the main direction of urban vagrant transformation work is to organize vagrants to participate in agricultural production in rural areas. This method is the easiest way to realize the principle of combining transformation and resettlement.

    The conference believes that all localities should adopt the following methods to resettle them for employment according to specific circumstances: In addition to planning to build more than 90 farms across the country this year to absorb them to participate in production, they should also be sent back to their hometowns to join agricultural cooperatives, follow immigrants to reclaim wasteland for production, or organize them to participate in engineering teams.

    The conference emphasized that in mobilizing vagrants to participate in labor employment, it is necessary to conduct open propaganda, explain policies, rely on the masses, and persuade and mobilize. It is also necessary to explain to the masses the state's policies and purposes in helping vagrants to labor and find employment in order to mobilize the broad masses to persuade them to be happy to go to work.

    帮助无业游民成为建设社会主义的力量
    中华人民共和国内务部最近在北京召开了游民改造工作会议，着重讨论和研究了城市游民的改造问题。
    内务部副部长陈其瑗在会上作了关于游民改造工作的报告。他在报告中指出，旧中国的罪恶统治，制造了大量的无业游民。中华人民共和国成立以来，人民政府和人民群众已经帮助大批的游民在劳动中得到改造。目前农村中的游民已基本上改造成为劳动者。报告中接着说：这次游民改造工作会议是在我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的发展，要求“人人各得其所”的情况下召开的。因此，要加速帮助城市中的游民就业，使他们成为建设社会主义的力量。
    会议确定了游民改造工作的方针。这个方针是“改造与安置相结合”。就是把无业游民安置在劳动生产的岗位上，督促他们学会劳动生产的本领，养成劳动的习惯，能够以自己的力量养活自己，从而也就达到了改造的目的。因此，改造和安置游民就是组织游民参加生产。
    会议认为，城市游民改造工作的主要方向是组织游民到农村参加农业生产。这个办法最容易实现改造和安置相结合的方针。
    会议认为，各地应根据具体情况，分别采取下面一些办法安置他们就业：除今年要在全国范围内筹建九十多个农场吸收他们参加生产外，还要遣送还乡插入农业合作社、随同移民垦荒生产或组织他们参加工程队。
    会议强调指出：在动员游民参加劳动就业的工作中，必须公开宣传，交代政策，依靠群众，说服动员。还应当向群众讲清国家帮助游民劳动就业的政策和目的，以发动广大群众说服他们乐于去就业。　（新华社）
