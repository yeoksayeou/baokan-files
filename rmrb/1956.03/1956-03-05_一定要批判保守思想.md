    We Must Criticize Conservative Thinking
    To the Editor:
    I am writing to expose the Jilin Province Farm Implement Factory's erroneous behavior in not valuing the rationalization proposals of worker Qi Fenglin. Qi Fenglin is a sixth-grade planer at the Jilin Province Farm Implement Factory, an advanced producer. In 1954, he improved 13 types of tool fixtures and completed two years' worth of quotas in one year, earning him the title of Labor Model of Siping City. Last year, with a spirit of innovation, he improved 12 technical measures, completing three years and three months' worth of quotas in one year, and was elected as a representative of the Jilin Provincial People's Congress. After the state issued the call to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, Qi Fenglin continuously put forward rationalization proposals to improve 13 technical measures in January of this year. However, due to the serious conservative thinking of factory director Yang Yizhi, deputy factory director Cheng Wanchang, deputy secretary of the Party branch Han Zhongxiao, and others, they not only did not actively support Qi Fenglin's rationalization proposals but also adopted a suppressive attitude, preventing Qi Fenglin's rationalization proposals from being adopted in a timely manner.
    After Qi Fenglin put forward these rationalization proposals, Director Yang, Deputy Director Cheng, and others did not conduct thorough research. They subjectively believed that these proposals did not have sketches or models and were not rationalization proposals at all. They also said, "Qi Fenglin's rationalization proposals are not guaranteed to be realized; they are empty slogans." They even slandered Qi Fenglin's motives for proposing rationalization suggestions as impure. In reality, before Qi Fenglin put forward these rationalization proposals, he had researched them with Zhang Yulin, the head of the technology department, and put forward technical bases for how each suggestion would be modified, how much efficiency would be increased, and how much money would be spent. They were confident in realizing these suggestions. Department Head Zhang Yulin repeatedly suggested to the factory director that he should support Qi Fenglin's proposals. However, the factory director criticized him, saying, "Qi Fenglin wants to fly to the sky; are you also supporting him?" Later, Zhang Yulin proposed to use his own money to allow Qi Fenglin to conduct trials, and if it was successful, he would reimburse the factory. Deputy Director Cheng instead criticized him for having serious ideological problems. Director Yang also said to the technicians who supported Qi Fenglin, "Whoever dares to guarantee that Qi Fenglin's suggestions will definitely succeed must write a guarantee." As a result, no one dared to express their attitude.
    On January 28, the factory director took advantage of Qi Fenglin's absence to hold a full day of technical appraisal meetings to "study" Qi Fenglin's suggestions. Technician Wang, technician Yang, and others who attended the meeting were unable to speak because they did not understand the situation. The deputy secretary of the Party branch, Han Zhongxiao, took the opportunity to summarize, saying, "According to everyone's opinions, most of Qi Fenglin's suggestions cannot be adopted." Engineers Yu Xuesan and Gong Weinong, who were sent by the Industrial Bureau, also agreed irresponsibly after listening to Secretary Han's conclusion. However, Qi Fenglin did not succumb to these conservative individuals. At the technical appraisal meeting on January 29, he exposed the conservative thinking of the factory leaders and introduced the technical basis of his 13 rationalization proposals in detail. However, Director Yang said, "Realizing Qi Fenglin's proposals would require adding new equipment and a large amount of national investment, which our local state-owned factory cannot do." Later, Department Head Zhang Yulin cited many examples to illustrate that Qi Fenglin's proposals were in line with the principle of "spending less money and doing more things." Other engineering technicians also believed that implementing Qi Fenglin's rationalization proposals only required using the factory's stagnant materials and existing equipment and would not require spending a lot of money. However, Director Yang and Deputy Director Cheng were still unwilling to adopt Qi Fenglin's suggestions. They attempted to use the method of "the minority submitting to the majority" to vote on whether to adopt Qi Fenglin's suggestions at the relevant meetings. After the Siping Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China learned about this matter, it stopped this erroneous practice.
    Later, the Minister of the Industry Department of the Siping Municipal Party Committee criticized the conservative thinking of Director Yang, Deputy Director Cheng, and Secretary Han, and organized technicians to repeatedly conduct technical appraisals to determine that most of Qi Fenglin's rationalization proposals, except for individual items that could not be realized due to equipment problems, were completely in line with technical theory, and the factory had the conditions to implement them. After these technical improvements were designed, manufactured, and put into production, they could save 1,613.8 workdays; that is to say, Qi Fenglin could complete five and a half years' worth of quotas in one year of 1956.
    The incident of Qi Fenglin's rationalization proposals being suppressed by the leaders of the Jilin Farm Implement Factory illustrates the harmfulness of right-leaning conservative thinking to production. Although the errors of the leaders of the Jilin Farm Implement Factory have been criticized, the phenomenon of treating workers' rationalization proposals with conservative thinking is still not isolated at present. I believe that in order to promote the enthusiasm and creativity of the working masses, we should widely expose and criticize the erroneous attitude of enterprise leaders in suppressing workers' enthusiasm for innovation.

### 一定要批判保守思想

    一定要批判保守思想编辑同志：
    我向你们揭发吉林省农具厂不重视工人齐凤林的合理化建议的错误行为。齐凤林是吉林省农具厂的六级刨工，一个先进生产者。1954年，他改进了13种工胎具，一年完成了两年定额，被评为四平市的劳动模范；去年他又以革新精神改进了12件技术措施，一年完成了三年零三个月的定额，被选为吉林省人民代表。当国家发出了提早完成五年计划的号召以后，齐凤林在今年1月份就连续提出了改进13项技术措施的合理化建议。但是，由于厂长杨义志、副厂长程万昌、党总支副书记韩忠孝等存在着严重的保守思想，他们不仅不积极支持齐凤林的合理化建议，反而采取压制的态度，使齐凤林的合理化建议没有及时得到采纳。
    齐凤林提出这些合理化建议以后，杨厂长、程副厂长等没有很好地进行研究，就主观地认为这些建议没有草图和模型，根本不算是什么合理化建议；并且说：“齐凤林的合理化建议没有把握实现，是空喊。”他们甚至污蔑齐凤林提合理化建议的动机不纯。实际上，齐凤林在提这些合理化建议以前，就和技术科科长张玉林作了研究，提出了每件建议怎么改、效率多高、花多少钱等技术根据，他们是有信心实现这些建议的。张玉林科长几次向厂长提出意见，希望支持齐凤林的建议。但是厂长却批评他说：“齐凤林要上天，你也支持他吗？”后来，张玉林提出自己拿钱给齐凤林试制，如果成功了再向工厂报销。程副厂长反而批评他有严重的思想问题。杨厂长还对支持齐凤林的技术人员说：“谁敢保证齐凤林的建议一定成功，谁给打保条。”这样一来，谁也不敢表示态度了。
    1月28日，厂长趁着齐凤林不在场就开了一整天的技术鉴定会，“研究”齐凤林的建议。到会的王技师、杨技术员等人因为不了解情况无法发言，党总支副书记韩忠孝就乘机作了总结说：“根据大家的意见，齐凤林的建议大部分不能采纳。”工业厅派去的工程师于学三、巩维农等听了韩副书记的结论以后，也以不负责任的态度表示同意。但是，齐凤林并没有在这种保守主义者面前屈服，他在1月29日的技术鉴定会上，揭发了工厂领导人员的保守思想，并且详细地介绍了他的13件合理化建议的技术根据。但是杨厂长却说：“实现齐凤林的建议就需要增加新设备，需要国家大量投资，咱们地方国营的工厂办不到。”后来张玉林科长举出了很多例子来说明齐凤林的建议是合乎“花钱少、办事多”的原则的。其他工程技术人员也认为实行齐凤林的合理化建议，只要利用本厂的呆滞材料和现有设备，并不需要花很多的钱。但是杨厂长和程副厂长等仍然不愿意采纳齐凤林的建议。他们企图利用“少数服从多数”的办法，在有关的会议上来表决是否采纳齐凤林的建议。中共四平市委员会知道这件事以后，制止了这种错误作法。
    后来，中共四平市委工业部部长对杨厂长、程副厂长、韩副书记的保守思想进行了批判，并且组织技术人员反复地进行技术鉴定，确定齐凤林的合理化建议除了个别项目因为设备问题不能实现以外，绝大部分完全合乎技术理论，而且工厂有条件施工。这些技术改进措施，经过设计制造投入生产以后，可以节约1，613.8个工作日；就是说，齐凤林在1956年一年内可以完成五年半的定额。
    齐凤林的合理化建议受到吉林农具厂领导人员压制的事件，说明了右倾保守思想对生产的危害性。吉林农具厂的领导人员的错误虽然已经受到了批判；但是，以保守思想对待工人合理化建议的现象在目前还不是个别的。我认为，为了发扬工人群众的积极性和创造性，我们应该广泛地揭发和批判企业领导人员压制工人创造热情的错误态度。
