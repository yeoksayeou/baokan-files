The advanced producer movement is vigorously unfolding at the First Automobile Works. In the 20-plus days since the movement began on February 20, workers at the factory have put forward more than 6,000 rationalization proposals. Most of these rationalization proposals revolve around the production task of producing automobiles ahead of schedule. Workers in the Tool Workshop Two put forward 86 rationalization proposals, 85 of which have been adopted. Among them, 8 rationalization proposals have solved key problems in production, enabling the Mobile Engineering Department to complete two months' production tasks within one month in March.

The Heat and Power Station, Stamping, Die, and Repair Workshops have improved production efficiency by promptly promoting the advanced experience of advanced producers. Among them, more than 80 turners in the Mechanic Section of the Repair Workshop promoted Zheng Shengyue's improved processing method for bevel gears, generally increasing production efficiency by more than seven times.

The number of advanced units and advanced producers appearing in the factory is increasing day by day. In mid-February, the factory just selected more than 240 factory-level model workers and advanced producers. In the past 20-plus days, more than 250 advanced figures and advanced units have newly appeared on the honor roll.

The unit engineering of 49 construction projects at the First Automobile Works has already undergone completion acceptance, and the acceptance work for the last one is about to begin. The quality of all the projects that have been accepted has reached excellent standards. The quality of structural engineering that determines the life of the factory building—metal structures, reinforced concrete structures, and load-bearing walls—is even better. The reason why the construction projects of the First Automobile Works have achieved excellent quality is that, while widely adopting the Soviet factory-based mechanized construction experience and promoting various new technologies, the construction workers have established a technical supervision system and strictly supervised the project quality during construction. Each construction process undergoes technical acceptance according to technical documents such as drawings, ensuring the quality of the project.

    第一汽车厂展开先进生产者运动
    49项建筑工程的单位工程全部质量优良
    第一汽车制造厂的先进生产者运动蓬勃展开。这个工厂的职工，从2月20日开展先进生产者运动以来的20多天中，就提出了6，000多件合理化建议。这些合理化建议，大多数是围绕着提前出汽车的生产任务提出的。工具二车间工人提出86件合理化建议，已经有85件被采纳，其中有8件合理化建议解决了生产中的关键问题，使机动工部在3月份一个月内就可以完成两个月的生产任务。
    热电站、冲压、冲模、机修等车间，由于及时推广了先进生产者的先进经验，提高了生产效率。其中机修车间机工部有80多个车工推广了本工部郑胜月改进伞齿轮的加工方法，普遍使生产效率提高七倍多。
    全厂出现的先进单位和先进生产者，一天比一天增多。2月中旬，全厂刚评选了240多名厂级劳动模范和先进生产者，最近20多天中，光荣榜上便又新出现了250多个先进人物和先进单位。
    第一汽车制造厂有49项建筑工程的单位工程已经作了竣工验收，最后一项的验收工作就要开始进行。已经验收的工程，质量全部达到优良标准。决定厂房寿命的结构性工程——金属结构、钢筋混凝土结构和承重墙壁等，质量更好。第一汽车制造厂建筑工程所以获得优良质量，是由于建筑工人在施工中广泛采用苏联工厂化机械化施工经验和推行各项新技术的同时，建立了技术监督制度，平时严格地监督工程质量。每道施工工序都根据图纸等技术文件进行技术验收，保证了工程质量。
