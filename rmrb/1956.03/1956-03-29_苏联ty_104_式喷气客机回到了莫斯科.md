    Soviet TU-104 Jet Airliner Returns to Moscow
    (Dispatch from our Moscow correspondent, March 28) A Soviet TU-104 jet airliner returned to Moscow from London on the 27th. The plane had flown to London on the 22nd. At 3:06 PM on the 27th, the aircraft with its swept wings, like a giant silver swallow, circled in the air and landed nimbly at Vnukovo Airport. Many Muscovites, including the aircraft's designer, Tupolev, were there to greet it. People watched the fast and comfortable airliner with excitement. The crew for this flight consisted of six people: the first navigator, the second navigator, the pilot, the aircraft radio operator, the aircraft mechanic, and the aircraft engineer. The first navigator, Starikov, said at the airport: "The flight from Moscow to London went very well. The return flight from London to Moscow was also normal. It once again proves the excellent quality of the aircraft. We took off from London Central Airport at 11:22 AM Moscow time and landed in Moscow at 3:06 PM. The weather was overcast and snowy at takeoff in London. We immediately gained altitude. We flew at an altitude of 10,000 meters without using oxygen equipment. The flight speed was 800 to 830 kilometers per hour."
    When the aircraft was in London, it attracted great attention from the British public and the media. Many people went to the airport every day to see the aircraft.
