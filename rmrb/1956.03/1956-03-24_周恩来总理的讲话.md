Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech

Your Excellency Ambassador, Ladies and Gentlemen:

Today is the day Pakistan declared itself a republic, and also the day His Excellency Iskander Mirza took office as the first President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. As the people of Pakistan warmly celebrate this important festival, I would like to express my heartfelt congratulations to the Government and people of Pakistan on behalf of the Chinese Government and people.

Like the vast majority of Asian and African countries, the people of Pakistan have long struggled against foreign aggression and oppression, and to get rid of the backwardness caused by colonialism. The establishment of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan is not only a new achievement for the people of Pakistan in striving for and strengthening national independence, but also opens up a broader path for Pakistan's independent development. The Chinese people are delighted and encouraged by this new achievement of the Pakistani people, and wish the Islamic Republic of Pakistan prosperity and strength.

In the past year, the friendly relations between China and Pakistan have developed significantly. During the Bandung Conference, the pleasant and frank talks I had with Mr. Ali, the then Prime Minister of Pakistan, greatly increased the understanding between our two countries. Since the Bandung Conference, the friendly exchanges between our two countries have become more frequent. The warm reception accorded to the Chinese women's delegation headed by Minister Li Dequan and Song Qingling, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of our country, during their successive visits to Pakistan, clearly marks the deep friendship between the people of our two countries. We are now sincerely looking forward to the visit of Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Ali to China soon. We believe that his friendly visit to China will further strengthen the friendly relations between China and Pakistan. For the construction of China and Pakistan, for the unity of Asian countries, and for the maintenance of world peace, there are broad possibilities for friendly cooperation between China and Pakistan. This is what we firmly believe, and we have been working hard for it.

Your Excellency Ambassador, Ladies and Gentlemen, I propose a toast,

To the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,

To the health of His Excellency Iskander Mirza, the first President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,

To the friendly cooperation between China and Pakistan,

To peace in Asia and the world,

Cheers!

    周恩来总理的讲话
    大使阁下、各位女士、各位先生：
    今天是巴基斯坦宣布为共和国的日子，也是巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国的第一任总统伊斯坎德尔·米尔扎阁下就职的日子。在巴基斯坦人民热烈地庆祝这个重要的节日的时候，我愿意代表中国政府和人民向巴基斯坦政府和人民表示衷心的祝贺。
    巴基斯坦人民像绝大多数亚非国家的人民一样，长期地为反对外来的侵略和压迫，为摆脱殖民主义所造成的落后而斗争。巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国的成立不仅是巴基斯坦人民争取和加强民族独立的新成就，而且为巴基斯坦的独立发展开辟了更加广阔的道路。中国人民对于巴基斯坦人民的这一新成就，感到欢欣鼓舞，并且预祝巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国繁荣、强大。
    过去一年来，中巴两国的友好关系有了显著的发展。在万隆会议期间，我同当时巴基斯坦的总理阿里先生所进行的愉快而坦率的谈话，大大地增加了我们两国之间的了解。万隆会议以来，我们两国之间的友好来往更加频繁。以李德全部长为首的中国妇女代表团和我国全国人民代表大会常务委员会宋庆龄副委员长，在先后访问巴基斯坦的期间所受到的热情款待，明显地标志出我们两国人民之间的深厚友谊。我们现在正在热诚地期待着巴基斯坦总理穆罕默德·阿里阁下不久之后来中国访问。我们相信，他对中国的友好访问将会进一步加强中巴两国的友好关系。为了中巴两国的建设，为了亚洲国家的团结，为了世界和平的保持，中巴两国有着友好合作的广泛可能性。这是我们深信不疑的，而且我们一直在为此而努力。
    大使阁下、各位女士、各位先生，我提议，
    为巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国的成立，
    为巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国首任总统伊斯坎德尔·米尔扎阁下的健康，
    为中巴两国的友好合作，
    为亚洲和世界的和平，
    干杯！
