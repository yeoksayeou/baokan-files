The agricultural production corps of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has widely launched a socialist labor competition with the aim of comprehensively exceeding the 1956 production and financial plan by comparing output targets, reducing production costs, profit, safety, and demonstration effects. The Victory First Farm in Aksu, the Bayingoleng Reclamation Area Farm, the Chepaizi Farm, the Quanshuidi Farm, and the August 1st Farm and other 5 military reclamation farms jointly proposed to all agricultural enterprises units of the Xinjiang Corps a call for increased production competition and comprehensive completion of the production and financial plan. Their competition conditions are: the 5 farms will sow a total of more than 430,000 mu (of which 106,000 mu is cotton). The average cotton yield per mu is 370 jin to 440 jin, and the grain crop yield per mu is 270 jin to 412 jin. High-yield crops: 3,600 mu of cotton, with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu; 14,300 mu of corn, with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu; 14,800 mu of winter wheat, aiming to achieve "ten thousand mu and ten thousand shi" (1 shi = 440 jin). The profit target should reach 40% to 85%, and the total cost should be reduced by 5% to 10% based on this year's plan. They also plan to help one to three agricultural producers' cooperatives increase production by 5% to 15%. Now, many farms in the Xinjiang Production Corps have responded to this initiative.

    新疆农业生产部队广泛展开劳动竞赛
    中国人民解放军新疆军区农业生产部队广泛地开展以比产量指标、比降低生产成本、比利润、比安全、比示范作用为内容，全面地超额完成1956年生产财务计划为目的的社会主义劳动竞赛。阿克苏胜利一场、巴音郭楞垦区农场、车排子农场、泉水地农场、八一农场等5个军垦农场联合向新疆部队各农业企业单位，提出丰产竞赛和全面完成生产财务计划的倡议。他们的竞赛条件是：5个农场总共播种43万多亩（其中棉花106，000亩）。棉花平均每亩产370斤到440斤，粮食作物每亩产270斤到412斤。高额丰产作物：棉花3，600亩，每亩产1，000斤；玉米14，300亩，每亩产1，000斤；冬小麦14，800亩，要达到万亩万石（1石440斤）。利润指标要达到40％到85％，总成本要在今年的计划基础上降低5％到10％。他们并且都计划帮助一至三个农业生产合作社提高产量5％到15％。现在，新疆生产部队已经有很多农场响应了这个倡议。（新疆生产战线报编辑部）
