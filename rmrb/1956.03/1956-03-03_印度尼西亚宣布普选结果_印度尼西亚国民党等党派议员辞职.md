Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 1st: The Chairman of the Indonesian Central Election Committee, Hadi Kusumo, announced the results of Indonesia's first general election held at the end of September last year at a public gathering in Jakarta on the morning of March 1st.

According to the announcement, the Indonesian Nationalist Party received the most votes in the general election, with over 8.43 million votes, followed by the Masyumi Party with over 7.9 million votes, the Nahdatul Ulama with over 6.95 million votes, and the Indonesian Communist Party with over 6.17 million votes. Other parties received very few votes. According to the announcement, based on the method of allocating parliamentary seats stipulated in the election law, the Indonesian Nationalist Party and the Masyumi Party each hold 57 seats, the Nahdatul Ulama 45 seats, and the Indonesian Communist Party 39 seats. The remaining 59 seats are distributed among 24 small parties. Another 3 seats are designated for West Irian, but because West Irian is still occupied by the Netherlands and elections cannot be held there, they will be appointed by the government.

Hadi Kusumo said that those who voted in the general election accounted for 87.65% of registered voters.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 2nd: Members of the Provisional Parliament from the Indonesian Nationalist Party, Nahdatul Ulama, Indonesian Communist Party, Indonesian Muslim League Party, Federation of Chinese Descent Citizens, Indonesian Central Labor Union, Indonesian People's League Party, Indonesian Peasants' Front, as well as some non-partisan members of parliament, jointly submitted their resignations to the Provisional Parliament on March 1st.

When asked by reporters about the reasons for the joint action taken by the opposition parties, Indonesian Nationalist Party leader Mangunsakoro said that this was because things that violated the usual parliamentary procedure and the principles of parliamentary democracy occurred at the parliamentary session on the evening of February 28th, and because after the election results were announced, the current Provisional Parliament should no longer continue to exist.

He pointed out that the Provisional Parliament's decision on the evening of February 28th, under the insistence of the ruling party's members, to prioritize the discussion of the bill on abolishing the Indonesian-Dutch Federation, rather than prioritizing the discussion of the motion of no confidence, violated the usual parliamentary procedure. He said that the decision on the bill was invalid.

Sadono, who resigned from the position of Speaker of the Parliament on February 28th, said that the current Provisional Parliament no longer represents the people, and the Harahap Cabinet has lost the support of the Provisional Parliament.

    印度尼西亚宣布普选结果
    印度尼西亚国民党等党派议员辞职
    新华社雅加达1日电　印度尼西亚中央选举委员会主席哈迪库苏莫1日上午在雅加达的一个公众集会上，宣布了去年9月底举行的印度尼西亚历史上第一次普选的结果。
    据宣布，印度尼西亚国民党在普选中得票最多，共843万多票，其次是马斯友美党得790万多票，回教师联合会695万多票，印度尼西亚共产党617万多票。其他党派所得票数都很少。据宣布，根据选举法所规定的国会席位分配办法，印度尼西亚国民党和马斯友美党各占57席，回教师联合会45席，印度尼西亚共产党39席。其余59席由24个小党派分别获得。另有3席规定分配给西伊里安，因为现在西伊里安仍被荷兰占领着，无法举行选举，它们将由政府加以指定。
    哈迪库苏莫说，在普选中投票的人占登记选民的87.65％。
    据新华社雅加达2日电　印度尼西亚国民党、回教师联合会、印度尼西亚共产党、印度尼西亚回教联盟党、中国血统公民联合会、印度尼西亚总工会、印度尼西亚人民联盟党、印度尼西亚农民阵线的临时国会的议员以及一些无党派议员在3月1日联合向临时国会提出了辞职。
    印度尼西亚国民党领袖曼贡萨科罗在答复记者关于反对党派采取这种联合行动的原因的时候说，这是因为在2月28日晚间的国会会议上发生了违反通常的国会议事程序和国会民主的原则的事情，并且因为在国会选举结果宣布之后，目前的临时国会不应当再继续存在下去。
    他指出，临时国会2月28日晚上在执政党派议员坚持下决定优先讨论关于废除印度尼西亚—荷兰联邦的法案，而不优先讨论不信任案的行动违反了通常的议事程序。他说，关于法案的决定是无效的。
    在2月28日辞去国会议长职务的沙多诺说，目前的临时国会不再代表人民，哈拉哈普内阁也失去了临时国会对它的支持。
