Demand an Explanation from the U.S. Government
A Letter from the Mother of the Murdered Bao Zhe'en

Reading so many letters in the newspapers demanding the return of relatives from the U.S. government has stirred up the endless hatred that has been buried in my heart for a long time. I want to accuse the U.S. government, which not only detained, threatened, and persecuted my son, but also killed him!

My only son, Bao Zhe'en, went to the United States in 1948 to study civil engineering at the University of Florida. After obtaining his master's degree in 1950, he stayed at the university to teach. After the liberation of the motherland, he eagerly wanted to return to the motherland, both to participate in the construction of the motherland and to see his elderly mother. He repeatedly asked the U.S. government to process his departure手续, but was always subjected to various unreasonable difficulties and obstructions. Therefore, he felt very indignant and felt that there was no freedom in the United States.

We kept in touch regularly. Unexpectedly, in May 1952, he suddenly sent a very strange letter, which said:

	"The doctor has found a subtle lung disease... forced to go to a sanatorium for recuperation... It is very likely that the Immigration Bureau has restrictions on Chinese professors, perhaps under surveillance, whether future communication is possible is still a question, remittances are also a problem, and even life is a problem. This is sudden and I cannot avoid it. Perhaps the changes in the international situation are also a major issue... I have been sleepless for several nights... My heart is very painful, what to do, what to do, may God bless you and me, until we meet again..." At the end of the letter, he added: "Is the subtle lung disease also...?" From this letter, one can imagine how nervous and frightened my son was at the time!

I was worried about my son's safety day and night. Then, about two months later, the president of the University of Florida had an American lawyer write a letter to me, saying that my son "is dead, and in order to arrange funeral expenses for him, all his belongings have been sold..."

I am an old woman nearly 60 years old, and this sudden news was like a bolt from the blue to me. I fainted several times on the spot. Due to excessive grief, I have now lost my normal health and often fall ill in bed.

My son was a very healthy and active young man when he went to the United States, but it is hateful that he died such an unexplained and wrongful death in the United States. I don't believe he would have died of lung disease like this. His last letter is ironclad evidence accusing the U.S. government of killing him.

I want to question, I want to accuse, why did the U.S. government kill my living, only son! The U.S. government must give an explanation for my son's unexplained death!

I implore the government to stand up for me and redress the injustice for my only son. Shanghai Wu Zhiyu

A Letter from Su Xianji from the United States

Attached is a letter I received from my cousin Su Xianji from the United States during the Spring Festival.

The simple course of events is as follows: My cousin went to the United States around 1949, studied at the University of Buffalo in New York State, and graduated from the New York Institute of Photography. Later, due to financial difficulties, he was unable to continue his studies and worked as a photojournalist, etc. In the past, he wrote saying that he wanted to leave the United States and return to the motherland, but could not return. After 1952, there were no more letters, until now when I received this letter.

According to this letter, it can be seen that he was persecuted by American agents because of his eagerness to return to the motherland. I firmly demand that the U.S. government stop this crime and allow my sixth brother and all Chinese students and overseas Chinese in the United States who are willing to return to the country to safely return to the embrace of the motherland.

Third Sister:

It has been 7 years since we parted. Of course, there has been endless suffering in these long years, and the feeling of missing home is really unbearable.

There is no way to return to China. I tried to escape to Hawaii a few years ago, but I couldn't find a way to return by boat. You know, the U.S. State Department does not allow us to return to our country.

But who wants to go to Taiwan?

7 years in the United States... have sobered my intoxicated mind and changed my outlook on life. The reason is simple. After contacting the United States for so many years, I have certainly suffered a lot, in other words, I have a real understanding of the United States...

I hope to be able to return to the motherland in 1956. Perhaps the only way is to ask the Immigration Bureau to "deport" me back to China...

You don't need to write to us either, there is no way to receive it, we are running around.

The U.S. State Department is currently looking for us. Yes, my thoughts are different from some people, but I am not qualified to be called a Communist Party member...

Currently, I have changed my name and surname, and replaced the sky and the sun. I hope you can understand our difficulty in changing our name...

How are the people at home? Please send my regards.

A Letter from Zhao Jingde's Parents, Zhao Zichen and Tong Dingzhen

We were extremely angry after reading the news about "Lu Zhiwei's Re-Accusation of the U.S. Authorities" in the People's Daily. Our son Jingde and daughter-in-law Ling Wanyu are also being deceived and detained by the U.S. authorities.

Our second son, Jingde, went to the United States in 1945 to study and received a doctorate in geological engineering from the University of Chicago in 1948. His wife, Ling Wanyu, took a daughter to the United States in 1947. Now a family of 5 lives in Chicago. Due to the obstruction of the U.S. government, they have been unable to return to China.

In 1950, the Sichuan Geological Survey invited Jingde to work and remitted travel expenses to allow him to return to China with his family. After receiving the remittance, Jingde immediately tried to set off. However, it was not possible due to the obstruction of the U.S. authorities. Later, Jingde wanted to return via Europe, but could only travel alone and could not return with his entire family.

In March 1952, they sent a letter expressing their desire to return to China. The letter also mentioned that because they wanted to return to their motherland, they were accused of being Communists. Since then, there has been no news. After the first agreement was reached at the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks last September, I sent three letters in succession from September 21 to October 6, but it has been almost half a year and there is still no news. We are very anxious.

I am now a professor at Yenching Union Theological Seminary. My old couple are both around 70 years old and look forward to the return of Jingde's entire family day and night. Because of our deep longing, we often cannot sleep at night. We ask the government to demand Jingde's entire family back from the U.S. government so that they can enjoy the freedom and happiness they deserve in the motherland and make the contributions they should make to the motherland.

A Letter from Tan Wen's Wife, Sun Fengyuan

My husband, Tan Wen, went to the United States in the spring of 1948 to study chemical engineering at the University of Washington in Seattle. After graduating in 1950, he repeatedly applied to the U.S. authorities to return to China, but because the U.S. Immigration Bureau repeatedly rejected his application, his desire to return to China has not been realized until now.

After the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks began in 1955, he applied to return to China again. He said in a letter brought back by a classmate who returned to China in August last year: "My application may be approved by the end of the year." By the end of the year, a letter said: "It is impossible by the end of the year, it may be approved in February 1956." In January of this year, another letter said: "Now it cannot be done in February due to a small formality, and it will take another two months." Not long ago, he wrote saying that he was "the earliest to apply for returning to China and the most to apply," but he has not returned to this day.

The above facts prove that the U.S. government not only has not seriously implemented the agreement on the return of civilians of both sides reached at the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks, but also continues to obstruct Chinese students from returning to China. The U.S. government's statement that "all those who apply to return to China are allowed to return" is a complete lie!

I request the government to stop this consistent and despicable behavior of the U.S. government! Let my husband and other students in the United States return safely and soon!

A Letter from Gu Weixin's Parents, Gu Weiru and Gao Ruoyun

Our four children are all working in state organs, and our family's life is very happy. However, our second son, Weixin, is still being detained in the United States, which makes us miss him day and night.

Weixin went to the United States in 1947 and entered Cornell University to study electrical engineering. After obtaining a master's degree, he worked in an electrical factory in Newark, New Jersey. In 1951, he received an offer from Tangshan Jiaotong University and prepared to return to China, but was unsuccessful due to the obstruction of the U.S. government. During the Geneva Conference in 1954, he and more than 40 Chinese students in the United States jointly wrote a letter to the Chinese delegation in Geneva, requesting them to negotiate with the U.S. government to release them to return to China. But he still cannot come back, and there has been no news for six or seven months, which makes us very suspicious and anxious. Has he been persecuted by the U.S. government?

Seeing the great plan of socialist industrialization in the motherland, thinking that the electrical engineering that Xin'er studied is exactly what the construction of the motherland urgently needs, and also that we are both over 60 years old and both suffer from chronic diseases, how can we not miss our beloved son and new daughter-in-law (married to Gu Ying, a student in the United States, in 1955) who have been separated for 8 years day and night? Therefore, we earnestly request the government to resolutely allow the U.S. government to allow Weixin and his wife to return to China quickly, so that they can serve the motherland as soon as possible and reunite the family.

A Letter from Wang Shunshan's Sister, Wang Suyuan

Since the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks in Geneva reached an agreement on the return of civilians of both sides, I have been eagerly looking forward to the return of my younger brother and sister-in-law studying in the United States to reunite with my 80-year-old mother and share family happiness. I did not expect the U.S. government to be inhuman and make my mother and daughter's hopes a bubble.

My younger brother, Wang Shunshan, went to the United States in 1946 to study bacteriology at the University of Iowa. My sister-in-law, Yu Shifan, studied gynecology at the University of Chicago.

They wrote letters expressing their urgent desire to return to the country as soon as possible. Shunshan wrote in a letter in September 1953: "...Now my old mother is 76 years old, and I still cannot go back to serve her and enjoy some happiness in her old age. This is really the most painful thing in my conscience... But today the U.S. government does not allow us to leave the country for those who study medicine, engineering, and science."

Since that letter, there has been no news from Shunshan. My mother and I are very anxious. Especially after seeing the miserable situation of Liu Yongming being tortured by the U.S. government in the newspaper recently, it makes us even more uneasy. Therefore, I request the government to protest to the U.S. authorities and resolutely demand that Shunshan and his wife and other students in the United States get rid of their fetters as soon as possible and return safely to the embrace of the motherland.

A Letter from Zhong Zhuru, Wife of Mai Shuhuai

I am a Hui Muslim woman, and I want to accuse the U.S. authorities of obstructing my beloved from returning to China in every possible way.

My beloved, Mai Shuhuai, graduated from the Department of Chemistry of Peking University and went to the United States in 1947. He is now doing biological research at Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago. After the liberation of the country, he eagerly hoped to return to the country, but he has been unable to return under the obstruction and threat of the U.S. government. He wrote in a letter in July 1953: "In 1952, the U.S. government decided that all Chinese personnel studying technology were not allowed to leave the country or plan to leave the country. If they violated this, they would be punished. At the same time, we are not allowed to send money to the country, and the same punishment will be imposed if found." In a letter in February 1954, he wrote: "Recently I watched the Chinese movie made in Moscow... Seeing the long-separated beautiful rivers and mountains, palace gates and city walls, who can not be sad." Finally, he wrote a poem by Du Fu on the letter:

	"Looking up at a hundred birds flying,
	Large and small must be paired,
	Human affairs are often changed,
	Forever looking at you."

It can be seen how much he misses his motherland! In another letter in March 1954, he wrote: "Although I have freedom to communicate with my family on the surface, it is actually restricted. Therefore, the letters I write to you are simplified and simplified to the point of being irrelevant." From here, it is not difficult to see the extent to which the U.S. government's spiritual persecution of Chinese students has reached barbaric levels.

Because my beloved repeatedly applied to return to China, although it was approved by the U.S. government, the U.S. government used various tricks to obstruct it. He wrote in a letter in May 1955: "Returning to the country has been approved, and it is scheduled to depart from the United States on the President Cleveland on September 15." But in August, he suddenly wrote: "I saw the letters from you, the children, and the family hoping for my return, and I can't wait to grow two wings and fly back to the motherland to reunite with my family, but due to practical restrictions, this happy gathering will have to be postponed for some time... I have agreed with the authorities and the shipping company and scheduled to return on the President Wilson on November 25." But since then, not only has my beloved not returned to the motherland, but there has been no news!

It has been 10 years since my beloved and I separated, and the mental suffering I have suffered is difficult to express. Now our two children are studying in elementary school, and the older child has gloriously joined the Young Pioneers. They all long to see their father. My beloved's 70-year-old father is becoming increasingly thin and mentally unstable because he misses his son. These further aggravate my painful feelings of missing my beloved.

I earnestly appeal to the government to resolutely demand that the U.S. government safely send back my beloved!

### 要美国政府作出交代

专栏：

    要美国政府作出交代
      被害的鲍哲恩的母亲的来信
    接连在报上读到了许多向美国政府要回亲人的信，唤起了我久藏心头的无穷愤恨。我要控诉美国政府，它非但扣留、威胁和迫害我的儿子，并且还杀害了我的儿子！
    我的独生子鲍哲恩，1948年去美国，进佛罗里达大学念土木工程系，1950年得硕士学位后，留校教书。祖国解放后，他迫切地想回到祖国，一方面可以参加祖国的建设，另一方面可以看看年老的亲娘。他多次向美国政府要求办理出境手续，但总是受到各种无理的留难和阻挠。因此，他感到很愤慨，觉得在美国没有自由。
    我们经常保持通信。不料在1952年5月里，他忽然来了一封很奇怪的信，信中说：
      “由医生查察，发现有肺病细微……迫赴疗养院休养……很可能移民局对于中国教授，有所限制，也许属于监视，今后通讯能否，尚成问题，汇款亦生问题，即生命亦生问题，事出唐突，男无法避免，大概国际时局变迁，亦其中一大问题……男失眠数夜……心中殊痛苦，奈何奈何，但愿上苍保佑你我，后会有期……”。信末又说：“即肺病细微问题，亦是？”。从这封信里，可以想像我儿子当时的心情是多么紧张和惊悸啊！
    我日夜为我儿子的安全感到焦虑。接着，约莫二个月后，佛罗里达大学校长托美国律师写了一封信给我，说我儿子“已死了，为了替他安排葬殓费，所以已将他的遗物全部变卖……”
    我是一个年近60的老妇人，这个突然而来的消息对我无异是一个晴天霹雳，我当场昏倒了好几次。由于过度的哀痛，现在我已失去了正常的健康，并且时常病倒在床上。
    我的儿子去美国时是一个身体很健康和很活跃的青年，可恨的是他这样不明不白的冤死在美国了。我不相信他会这样死于肺病，他的最后一封信，就是控诉美国政府杀害他的铁证。
    我要质问，我要控诉，美国政府为什么杀害我的活生生的独子！美国政府对于我儿子的不明不白的死必须作出交代！
    我恳求政府替我作主，替我的独子申冤。　上海　吴志豫

        苏先绩从美国的来信
    附上春节收到我堂哥苏先绩从美国寄来的信。
    事情的简单经过是这样的：我堂哥大约于1949年赴美，进纽约州巴佛罗大学学习，并在纽约摄影研究学院毕业。后因经济困难，未能继续求学，曾任摄影新闻记者等职。过去他曾来信说他很想离开美国回到祖国，但是回不来。1952年以后再也没有来信，直到现在才收到这封信。
    根据这封来信，可以看出由于他迫切地想回到祖国，因而受到了美国特务的迫害。我坚决要求美国政府停止这种罪行，并让我的六哥和所有在美愿意回国的中国留学生和侨民都能安全地回到祖国怀抱。
                      北京　苏先模
    附苏先绩来信三妹：
    离别已经7年了，在这漫长的岁月中，当然是无限的苦痛，思念家乡之情实在无法压制。
    想回国没有办法，数年前设法逃到夏威夷，想尽办法，都没法乘船返国。你知道，美国国务院是不许我们返回祖国的。
    但谁愿意去台湾？
    在美7年……，清醒了自己迷醉的头脑，改变了自己人生观。原因很简单，同美国接触了这么多年，当然是受了不少气，换句话说，对美国有真实的了解……。
    我希望在1956年内可以回到祖国，也许唯一的办法是请求移民局“驱逐”我回国……
    你也用不着写信给我们，是没有办法收到的，我们东奔西走。
    目前美国国务院在找我们。是的，我的思想虽和有些人不同，但我还没资格说是共产党员……
    目前改名换姓，偷天换日，这一点希望你能体谅我们改名之苦衷……
    家中人们情形如何？请代致意。
                        六　哥
                  1955年12月28日
  赵景德的父母赵紫宸和童定珍的来信
    在人民日报上读了“陆志韦再度指控美国当局”的消息，我们也极愤怒。我们的儿子景德和儿媳凌琬瑜也是被美国当局蒙蔽扣留着的。
    我们的第二个儿子景德，1945年到美国留学，1948年在芝加哥大学得地质工程博士学位。他的爱人凌琬瑜，1947年携带一女去美国。现在一家5口寄居芝加哥，由于美国政府的阻挠一直不能回国。
    1950年，四川地质调查所聘请景德去工作，并汇寄路费，让他携眷回国。景德收到汇款后，即设法启程。但由于美当局的阻挠没有成行。后来，景德想从欧洲绕道回来，但只能单人旅行，也无法全家回国。
    1952年3月他们寄来一信，诉说希望回国的心情，信中并提到因为他们要回祖国，被人指为共产党员。此后便杳无音信。去年9月，中美大使级会谈达成第一项协议之后，从9月21日到10月6日，我接连寄去三封信，但至今已将近半年，仍杳无音讯，我们心急如焚。
    我现在是燕京协和神学院教授，我们老夫妇都是70上下的人，日夜盼望景德全家归来，因为思念殷切，往往夜不成眠。我们要求政府向美国政府要回景德全家，好叫他们在祖国享受到他们应得的自由和幸福，作他们对祖国应作的贡献。
                北京　赵紫宸　童定珍
      谭文的妻子孙凤元的来信
    我的丈夫谭文在1948年春赴美，进西雅图华盛顿州立大学，研究化学工程。1950年毕业后，即一再向美当局申请回国，但由于美国移民局屡次拒绝他的申请，以致他的回国愿望直到现在还没有实现。
      自1955年中美大使级会谈开始后，他又申请回国，他托去年8月间回国同学带来的信上说：“我的申请可能于年底获准”。到了年底来信说：“年底不可能了，1956年
  2月可能获准”。今年1月又来信说：“现因一点小手续未能办妥，2月又不可能回国，还要等两个月的时间”。不久前他来信说，他是“申请回国最早的，也是申请次数最多的”，但直到今天还没有回来。
    上面的事实证明美国政府非但没有认真履行中美大使级会谈有关双方平民回国问题的协议，而且还继续在阻挠中国留学生回国。美国政府发表“凡是申请回国的都让回国了”的声明完全是谎言！
      我请求政府制止美国政府这种一贯不讲信义的卑鄙行为！让我的丈夫和其他留美学生平安地早日回来！
                    四川梁平　孙凤元
  顾维馨的父母顾卫如和高若云的来信
    我们的4个子女都在国家机关工作，我们一家的生活过得非常愉快。但我们的次子维馨至今还被阻留在美国，使我们日夜思念不安。
    维馨在1947年去美国，进康奈尔大学，学电机工程，得硕士学位后，即在新泽西州纽渥克城一家电气厂工作。1951年，他得到唐山交通大学聘书，准备回国，但因美政府阻挠，没有成功。1954年日内瓦会议时，他和中国留美学生40余人联名写信给日内瓦中国代表团，要求向美国政府交涉释放他们回国。可是至今仍不能回来，并且已有六、七个月没有音信，使我们非常怀疑和焦虑，是否受到了美国政府的迫害？
    看到祖国社会主义工业化的伟大计划，想到馨儿所学的电机工程正是祖国建设迫切需要的，同时我俩都是年逾60的人，且均患慢性疾病，对一别8年的爱子和新媳（1955年和留美学生顾瑛结婚），怎么不日夜思念呢？因此恳请政府坚决要美国政府准许维馨夫妇迅速回国，让他们早为祖国效劳，并使骨肉团聚。

        王舜山的姐姐王素媛来信
    自日内瓦中美大使级会谈关于双方平民回国问题达成协议后，我殷切地盼望着留学美国的弟弟和弟妇的归来，与80岁的母亲团聚，共享天伦之乐，没想到美国政府毫无人性，使我母女的盼望成为泡影。
    我弟弟王舜山，1946年赴美——在衣阿华大学进修细菌学。弟妇俞世范，在芝加哥大学学习妇科。
    他们来信表示迫切希望早日返国。舜山1953年9月来信说：“……如今老娘已是76岁，我还不能回去侍奉她享受几许晚年的乐趣，这实在是良心最痛苦的事……但是今天美国政府不准我们学医学工程及学理科的人员离境。”
      自这封信以后，舜山再也没有音信，我与母亲都很焦虑，尤其近日在报上看到刘永铭被美国政府百般折磨的惨状，更使我们忐忑不安，因此请求政府向美国当局提出抗议，坚决要求让舜山夫妇和其他留美学生早脱羁绊，平安地回到祖国怀抱。
              济南　王素媛奉母之命
      买树槐的妻子钟竹如的来信
    我是一个回族妇女，我要控诉美国当局百般阻挠我的爱人不能回国的事实。
    我的爱人买树槐，北京大学化学系毕业，1947年去美国，现在芝加哥西北医学院做生物研究工作。全国解放后，他就殷切希望回国，但在美国政府的阻挠和威胁下，一直不能回来。1953年7月来信说：“1952年美国政府决定凡中国学技术的人员一概不许离境或作离境的打算，如果违犯处以刑罚，同时也不允许我们给国内寄钱，查出后受同样的处分。”1954年2月来信说：“最近看了在莫斯科摄制的我们中国的电影……看到久别的大好河山，宫门城阙，谁能不黯然神伤”。最后在信上写了一首杜甫的诗：
    “仰视百鸟飞，
    大小必双翔，
    人事多错迁，
    与君永相望”。
    可见他是多么想念祖国啊！1954年3月又来信说：“虽然我在表面上有和家人通信自由，但是事实上是受到限制的，因而我给你写的信简了又简，以至简到不关痛痒的程度”。从这里，不难看出美国政府对中国留学生的精神迫害达到何等野蛮的程度。
    由于我的爱人一再申请回国，虽被美国政府批准，但美国政府又用各种诡计进行阻挠。1955年5月他来信说：“返国已被批准，订于9月15日乘克利佛兰总统号轮由美动身返国”。但到8月忽又来信说：“我看到你和孩子以及家人盼望我回国的信，恨不得长上两个翅膀飞回祖国好与家人重聚，但为了实际的限制，这个欢聚的日子还要推后一些时日……已与当局和轮船公司言妥，订于11月25日乘威尔逊总统号回国”。但从那时起，我爱人不仅没有回到祖国，并且音讯也杳然了！
    我和我的爱人离别已10年，精神上遭受的痛苦是难于言喻的。现在我们两个孩子已在小学读书，大的孩子还光荣地参加了少先队，他们都渴望看到自己的爸爸。我的爱人年已70的父亲，因为想念儿子而日益消瘦，精神也不正常，这些更加重了我思念爱人的痛苦心情。
    我恳切向政府呼吁，坚决要美国政府安全地送回我的爱人！
