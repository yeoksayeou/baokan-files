    Organize Technical Inspection Personnel to Carry Out Competitions
    Kong Sang
    The "Guarantee Quality, Prevent Defective Products" competition initiated by the technical inspection departments of the State-owned Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory and three other factories will greatly promote and encourage technical inspection personnel to cooperate with production workers and strive to improve product quality.
    Improving product quality is an important task in China's current industrial production. To improve product quality, in addition to requiring production workers to strive to improve their skills, designers to improve the quality of drawings, process personnel to improve process quality, and formula personnel to formulate good raw materials, it is also necessary for technical inspection personnel to do a good job in the inspection of raw materials to ensure that workers receive qualified raw materials. Technical inspection personnel also need to do a good job in quality inspection and analysis of semi-finished products and finished products, so that workers and enterprise leaders can promptly understand who produced defective products and why defective products were produced, so as to quickly take measures to improve product quality. Therefore, technical inspection is an indispensable task with a positive role in improving product quality and preventing defective products. Li Keshun, a lathe operator at the State-owned Shanghai No. 2 Textile Machinery Factory, used to produce many defective products, and he had been subjected to various administrative sanctions because of this. Since the factory implemented statistical inspection, due to the mutual cooperation between the technical inspection personnel and him, the number of defective products has gradually decreased, and by the fourth quarter of last year, defective products had been eliminated.
    However, in many enterprises, the technical inspection work is still lagging behind the needs of production development, and phenomena such as missed inspections, incorrect inspections, or lax inspections still occur frequently, and defective products cannot be discovered in time. The main reasons for this situation are: First, the technical inspection personnel's professional level is low or their sense of responsibility is not high; second, the leaders do not pay attention to product quality, and when a few workers or management personnel resist quality inspection, they do not support the technical inspection personnel in fighting against this wrong behavior, so that the inspection work cannot be carried out. Now, the workers have launched a socialist competition to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. In order to effectively guarantee product quality, it is necessary to further strengthen technical inspection work. All enterprises should, like the Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory and other factories, organize and help technical inspection personnel to carry out internal or inter-factory professional competitions, exchange work experience with each other, continuously improve their professional level and sense of responsibility, and strengthen quality inspection work. This is an important link in improving product quality.

    组织技术检查人员开展竞赛
    孔桑
    国营上海汽轮机厂等四个工厂的技术检查科所倡议的开展“保证质量，预防废品”的竞赛，对推动和鼓励技术检查人员同生产工人协作，为提高产品质量而努力将起很大的作用。
    提高产品质量，是我国工业生产当前的一个重要任务。要提高产品质量，除了需要生产工人努力提高技术，设计人员提高图纸质量，工艺人员提高工艺质量，配方人员配好原料以外，还需要技术检查人员做好原材料的检验工作，保证工人得到质量合格的原材料，需要技术检查人员做好半成品、成品的质量检验和分析，使工人和企业领导人员及时了解谁出了废品、次品，以及为什么出了废品、次品，从而迅速采取提高产品质量的措施。所以，技术检验是对提高产品质量，预防废品、次品具有积极作用的不可缺少的一项工作。国营上海第二纺织机械厂车工李克顺以往生产的产品废品很多，他曾因此受过各种行政处分，自从工厂里推行统计检查以后，由于技术检查人员同他相互协作，废品就逐渐下降，到去年第四季度已经消灭了废品。
    但是，在不少企业中，技术检验工作还落后于生产发展的需要，漏检、错检或检验不严的现象仍经常发生，废品、次品不能及时发现。造成这种情况的主要原因：一是技术检查人员业务水平低或者责任心不高；一是领导人员不重视产品质量，当少数工人或管理人员抗拒检查质量的时候，不支持技术检查人员向这种错误行为进行斗争，使检验工作没法进行。现在，工人们已经为提前完成五年计划开展了社会主义竞赛。为了切实地保证产品质量，必须进一步加强技术检验工作。各企业应该像上海汽轮机厂等工厂一样，组织和帮助技术检查人员开展厂内的或厂际的同业务竞赛。互相交流工作经验，不断提高业务水平和责任心，加强质量检验工作，这是提高产品质量的一个重要环节。
