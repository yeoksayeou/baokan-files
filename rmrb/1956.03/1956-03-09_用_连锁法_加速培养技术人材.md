    Accelerating the Training of Technical Personnel Using the "Chain Method"
    Cao Cunchang, Engineer, Gearbox Workshop, First Automobile Works

    Under the encouragement of the new situation, the construction progress of our First Automobile Works is accelerating. The first batch of cars will be produced before October 1st! However, on the eve of commencing mass production, there is a significant shortage of technical personnel. For example, according to the organizational design, we are still short of more than 200 engineers and many foremen and adjustment workers when production begins.

    In such a great era, the speed of socialist construction is advancing by leaps and bounds, and it is not surprising that technical strength cannot keep up. So, how should this problem be solved?

    Last December, I was deeply moved when I heard the factory party committee secretary convey the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's emphasis on and care for intellectuals. I thought that in addition to actively participating in socialist competitions and working hard to complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, the most important thing for us technical personnel is to vigorously train a new generation to become skilled in new technologies. Therefore, at the first intellectual symposium held by the factory party committee in January this year, I suggested that every engineer in the factory should take two senior technicians and train them to become junior engineers. Later, I personally witnessed the comprehensive victory of socialist transformation in Changchun, and I felt that the training of personnel was becoming increasingly urgent. Relying solely on one engineer taking two apprentices is far from meeting the new needs. More people should be allowed to teach or help others learn technology, so that everyone can have someone to help them learn technology, and also be able to help several other people learn. Therefore, at the Changchun Municipal Labor Competition Mobilization Meeting, I also proposed the suggestion of using the "chain method" to train technical personnel. The Jilin Province and Changchun City Federation of Trade Unions both attached importance to this opinion. The factory's party committee and trade union even sent people to help me identify this method and promoted its implementation throughout the factory, immediately turning this suggestion into a concrete action for the entire factory.

    Using the "chain method" to train technical personnel is a socialist method of providing assistance at each level. In our workshop, the method is as follows: First, each engineer takes two senior technicians, helps them formulate a technical learning plan, and determines the required reference books, courses, and progress. Check their learning progress once every week or two and answer difficult questions. This learning plan should be combined with the technician's own two-year small plan, so that they can realize their determination to improve their technical and professional level by two to three grades within two years. This learning is not limited to self-study in spare time, but can also be carried out during the work process.

    In addition, each senior technician can take two intermediate technicians or foremen; each intermediate technician can take two junior technicians, workshop adjustment workers, or foremen with lower levels of education; each foreman can take two work section adjustment workers; and each work section adjustment worker can take two process workers. This "chain" of teaching can enable everyone to improve themselves and help others, and can link the learning and improvement of technical personnel throughout the workshop, creating mutual concern and mutual supervision.

    The role of this method is to organize help and encourage everyone to quickly master the new Soviet technology to adapt to the needs of the ever-developing socialist construction. Its biggest advantage is that it combines theory with practice and work. Because both the teacher and the student are in the same production department, they understand each other's needs and strengths, and understand what problems urgently need to be solved in the work. In this way, the content of learning can meet the actual needs; the trained personnel are generally more suitable for the needs of the work.

    In the process of teaching at each level, not only should the content of the teaching be different, but the teaching methods should also be changed according to the specific situation and the level of education and acceptance ability. Each student must be required to keep a learning manual. In the learning manual, the student should record in detail their learning experiences, the content taught by the teacher, the reasons for correctness and errors, and the operating methods. In this way, it can not only help with memory and serve as a basis for checking progress, but also serve as a foundation for disseminating the learned experience.

    In our gearbox workshop, 80% of the people have now participated in this type of learning. The entire factory is also enthusiastically promoting this method. Our preliminary gains are: (1) The atmosphere of unity and mutual assistance has been enhanced compared to the past. (2) The realization of each technician's two-year plan has a reliable guarantee, everyone is working more actively, the entire workshop's confidence in improving its technical level has also been improved, and the enthusiasm for work is even greater.

    The factory's party committee and trade union attach great importance to the promotion of this method. The Jilin Provincial Federation of Trade Unions has also issued a notice to trade unions throughout the province to promote this method, and sent a letter of congratulations. This makes me deeply feel that the Party gives cordial care and enthusiastic support to any small suggestion from intellectuals, as long as it is beneficial to socialist construction. The question is how we intellectuals should carry out self-transformation, improve our class consciousness, work hard, and quickly train new personnel to contribute to the socialist construction of the motherland. I will definitely do my best to achieve this. Here, I would like to suggest to engineers across the country: Let us jointly revise, improve, and implement this "chain method" of training technical personnel, and respond to Premier Zhou's call for intellectuals to accelerate the training of technical personnel and serve socialist construction.

### 用“连锁法”加速培养技术人材

    用“连锁法”加速培养技术人材
    第一汽车制造厂变速箱车间工程师　曹存昌
    在新形势的鼓舞下，我们第一汽车制造厂建厂的进度愈来愈快，10月1日以前就要提前生产出第一批汽车了！但是我们在开工大生产的前夕，技术人材显得特别缺乏。譬如按照组织设计，开工生产的时候还缺少200多名工程师和许多工长和调整工。
    在这样伟大的时代里，社会主义建设的速度一日千里，技术力量跟不上，并不是稀奇的事情。那末，这个问题应当怎样来解决呢？
    在去年12月间，我听到厂里党委书记传达党中央和毛主席对于知识分子的重视和关怀，心里非常感动。我想，我们技术人员除了积极参加社会主义竞赛，为提前完成第一个五年计划努力工作以外，最重要的就是大力培养新的一代成为熟练掌握新技术的人材。所以在今年1月工厂党委召开的第一次知识分子座谈会上，我就建议全厂每一位工程师带两个高级技术员，培养他们成为初级工程师。以后，我亲眼看到长春市社会主义改造取得全面胜利，觉得培养人材的事情愈来愈急。单凭一个工程师带两个徒弟，远不能满足新的需要，应当让更多的人来传授或帮助别人学习技术，使每个人都能够有一定的人来帮助他学习技术，同时也能够帮助另外几个人学习。因此，我在长春市劳动竞赛动员大会上，又提出了用“连锁法”培养技术人材的建议。吉林省、长春市工会联合会都重视这个意见。我们工厂的党委和工会更派人帮助我鉴定了这个方法，并且在全厂推广实施，立刻把这个建议变成全厂的具体行动。
    用“连锁法”培养技术人材是一种社会主义的逐级帮助的方式。在我们车间里是这样做法：首先由每个工程师带两个高级技术员，帮助他们订好学习技术的计划，确定必修的参考书、课程和进度。在每一个星期或两个星期中检查一次他们的学习成绩，并且解答疑难问题。这种学习计划应当同技术员本人的二年小规划结合起来，使他们能实现在二年内使技术、业务水平提高二至三级的决心。这种学习也不限于只在业余时间自修，还可以在工作过程中进行。
    另外，每一个高级技术员可以带两个中级技术员或工长；每一个中级技术员可以带两个初级技术员、车间调整工或文化较低的工长；每一个工长可以带两个工部调整工；每一个工部调整工可以带两个工序工。这样“连锁”地传授下去，可以使每个人都能提高自己和帮助别人，可以使整个车间技术人员的学习和提高都能一环扣一环地连锁起来，互相关心互相督促。
    这个方法的作用，是有组织地帮助和带动大家尽快地掌握苏联的新技术，来适应日益发展的社会主义建设的需要。它的最大的优点是：结合实际，结合工作。因为教学的双方都在一个生产部门中，互相了解对方的需要和长处，了解什么是工作中迫切需要解决的问题，这样，学习的内容就可以切合实际需要；培养出来的人材，一般也就更适合工作的需要。
    在逐级传授中，不但传授的内容要有不同，传授的方法也应该根据具体情况，按照文化程度和接受能力等逐级变化。必须要求每个学员做好学习手册。在学习手册中，要详细记录学习中的心得，老师的传授内容，正误的道理，以及操作方法等。这样一方面可以帮助记忆，作为检查成绩的根据；另方面，也可以作为传播学得的经验的基础。
    我们变速箱车间，现在已经有80％的人参加了这样的学习。全厂也正在热烈推行这一办法。我们初步的收获是：（一）团结、互助的气氛比从前增强。（二）技术员每人的二年规划的实现都有了可靠的保证，每个人工作更加积极，整个车间提高技术水平的信心也提高了，工作劲头也更大了。
    对于推行这个方法，我们厂的党委和工会都非常重视。吉林省工会联合会也通令全省工会推广这一办法，并且来信道贺。这使我深深感到，党对知识分子任何细小的建议，只要对社会主义建设有利，都给以亲切的关怀和热情的支持。问题是我们知识分子怎样来进行自我改造，提高阶级觉悟，努力工作和迅速培养新的人材，为祖国社会主义建设贡献力量。我一定要尽最大努力来做到这一点。在这里，我谨向全国的工程师建议：让我们一起修正、提高并且实行这个用“连锁法”培养技术人材的办法，响应周总理提出的知识分子要加速培养技术人材，为社会主义建设服务的号召。
