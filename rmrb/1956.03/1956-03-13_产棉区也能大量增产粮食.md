Cotton-Producing Areas Can Also Greatly Increase Grain Production
Shang Kai

The Jinnan Plain is an important economic crop area in Shanxi Province. The area of cotton fields in the region has expanded from 1.3 million mu in 1949 to 3.47 million mu in 1955, accounting for 17.7% of the cultivated land area. In many areas, the cotton fields have expanded to over 40% to 60%. According to the requirements of the state, the cotton fields in the Jinnan area will continue to expand year by year, and it is planned to expand to 5 million mu by 1962, at which time the cotton fields will account for more than 25% of the cultivated land area.

Due to the annual expansion of cotton fields, the planting area of ​​grain fields has been shrinking year by year, and grain production has also decreased accordingly. Obviously, with the continued expansion of cotton fields, the contradiction between cotton and grain will become increasingly acute. If this problem is not solved in time, it will not only increase the state's burden of supplying grain indefinitely, but also affect the lives of the masses, frustrating their enthusiasm for expanding cotton fields and increasing cotton production.

The only way to solve the contradiction between grain and cotton is to achieve simultaneous and substantial increases in both grain and cotton production. How can we ensure simultaneous and substantial increases in grain and cotton production? The Jugang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiazhuang, Hongzhao County, has pointed out a direction for the Jinnan area, which is to implement intercropping in wheat fields. In 1955, the Jugang Cooperative had a total of 363 mu of land, including 182 mu of cotton fields, with a yield of 115 jin of ginned cotton per mu. The 162 mu of irrigated wheat fields yielded 379 jin of wheat per mu. After the wheat harvest, all fields were intercropped with corn, yielding 464 jin per mu. The total grain yield for both wheat and autumn harvests was 843 jin per mu. In that year, the Jugang Cooperative not only no longer relied on state grain supplies, but also sold more than 70,000 jin of grain to the state.

Implementing intercropping in wheat fields and increasing the production of coarse grains and feed crops can both reduce the state's grain supply and develop animal husbandry. Animal power, fertilizer, and meat can all be appropriately addressed, thereby ensuring continuous increases in both grain and cotton production. This is the key to tapping production potential and increasing production in the Jinnan economic crop area. From the current distribution of crops in Jinnan, more than 1.1 million mu of wheat were planted in the region last winter. If one-third, or 3.7 million mu, of the wheat stubble land is intercropped with crops such as corn, millet, and potatoes after the wheat harvest this year, and each mu yields an average of 400 jin of raw grain, the region can increase grain production by 1.5 billion jin. This alone would be enough to feed 3.5 million people in Jinnan for a year.

The Party and government leading organs in the Jinnan area attach great importance to intercropping in wheat fields. Based on the new situation of the realization of cooperativization in the region, they plan to expand the intercropping area to 3.5 million mu this year, 4 million mu in 1957, 5 million mu in 1962, and 7 million mu in 1967, which will then account for 80% of the 9 million mu of wheat fields. The problem of the contradiction between grain and cotton can then be basically solved.

Implementing intercropping in wheat fields is an important reform in the cropping system. In addition to strengthening the Party's political and ideological education and overcoming the conservative ideas of cadres and the masses, it is also necessary to solve the two problems of water conservancy and fertilizer.

In the Jinnan area, there is often drought and no rain every year during the summer and autumn seasons, which is when water is urgently needed for intercropping. To solve this problem, it is necessary to develop artificial irrigation. One of the main reasons why the Jugang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hongzhao County was able to achieve high yields was because they turned dry land into irrigated land. However, at present, there are only 1.7 million mu of irrigated land in the Jinnan region, accounting for only 8.7% of the total cultivated land. The Jinnan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China studied the natural conditions of the region and believed that the region not only has more than 10 rivers such as the Fenhe River and the Shushui River above ground that can be used to build canals to divert water, but also has abundant underground water sources that can be used to develop well irrigation on a large scale. Therefore, it has put forward the requirement to develop water conservancy on a large scale and rapidly expand irrigated land. Before this year's spring plowing, the region will expand irrigated land by 4.5 million mu on the existing basis, and expand it to 12 million mu in 1962. At that time, each rural person in the region can have an average of 3 mu of irrigated land, basically getting rid of the threat of drought. In order to realize this plan, since last winter, the people of Jinnan have launched a vigorous water conservancy construction campaign. As of now, 473 small-scale water conservancy projects have been completed, 126 are under construction, 10,179 wells have been completed, and 1,732 are under construction. After these projects are completed, the irrigated area can be expanded by more than 400,000 mu.

Preparing sufficient fertilizer is also the key to ensuring high yields from intercropping. According to this year's planting plan (3.7 million mu of cotton fields, 3.5 million mu of intercropped crops, and 2 million mu of wheat topdressing), the region needs a total of 25 million carts of fertilizer, and there is currently a shortage of 10 million carts. The most fundamental way to solve the fertilizer problem is to mobilize the masses to accumulate a large amount of natural fertilizer. Since last winter, 200,000 young men and women in the region have organized 10,000 fertilizer accumulation shock teams and launched a vigorous fertilizer accumulation campaign. Hongzhao, Xieyu and other counties have composted almost all of the cotton stalks and corn stalks. In Linyi and Yongji, the work of converting dry latrines (toilets) to water latrines is also actively underway.

    产棉区也能大量增产粮食
    商恺
    晋南平原是山西省的重要经济作物区。全区棉田已经由1949年的130万亩，扩大到1955年的347万亩，占耕地面积的17.7％。其中有许多地区的棉田已扩大到40％至60％以上。依照国家的要求，晋南地区的棉田还要逐年扩大，到1962年计划扩大到500万亩，那时候棉田将占耕地面积25％以上。
    由于棉田逐年扩大，粮田的播种面积逐年缩小，粮食产量也相对地减少。很显然，随着棉田的继续扩大，棉粮之间的矛盾将会日趋尖锐。如果不及时解决这个问题，不仅会无限制地增加国家供应粮食的负担，而且会影响到群众的生活，挫折群众扩大棉田增产棉花的积极性。
    解决粮棉矛盾的唯一途径，就是要做到粮棉同时增产和大量增产。怎样才能保证粮棉同时增产和大量增产呢？洪赵县下庄巨光农业生产合作社给晋南地区指出了一个方向，这就是实行麦田复播。巨光社1955年共有土地363亩，其中棉田182亩，每亩产皮棉115斤。水地麦田162亩，每亩产小麦379斤，麦收以后，全部复播玉米，每亩产464斤，麦秋两季每亩共产粮食843斤。这一年，巨光社不仅不再依赖国家供应粮食，而且还卖了7万多斤粮食给国家。
    实行麦田复播，增加杂粮和饲料作物的生产，既可减少国家粮食供应，又可发展养畜业，畜力、肥料、肉食都可得到适当解决，从而保证粮棉不断增产。这在晋南经济作物区是挖掘生产潜力增加生产的关键。从目前晋南农作物的分布情况来看，去年冬天全区共播种小麦1，100多万亩，今年麦收以后，如果在三分之一即370万亩的麦茬地上复播玉米、谷子、薯类等作物，按每亩平均产原粮400斤计，全区即可增产粮食15亿斤。仅此一项，就够晋南350万人吃一年。
    晋南地区的党政领导机关对麦田复播非常重视，他们根据全区已经实现了合作化的新形势，计划今年扩大复播面积到350万亩，1957年扩大到400万亩，1962年扩大到500万亩，1967年扩大到700万亩，那时将占到900万亩麦田的80％。粮棉矛盾问题就可以基本解决了。
    实行麦田复播，是耕作制度上的一项重要改革，除了必须加强党的政治思想教育，克服干部和群众的保守思想以外，还必须解决水利和肥料两个问题。
    晋南地区每年夏秋之交，也就是复播前后急需用水的时候，往往干旱无雨。要解决这个问题，只有发展人工灌溉。洪赵县巨光农业生产合作社所以能够获得高额丰产，其主要原因之一就是因为他们把旱田变成了水田。但是，目前晋南全区只有水田170万亩，仅占全部耕地的8.7％。中共晋南地委研究了全区的自然条件，认为全区不仅地上水有汾河、涑水河等10余条河流可供修渠引水，而且地下水源也很充沛，可以大量发展水井灌溉，因此便提出了大量发展水利、迅速扩大水田的要求。全区今年春耕前将在现有的基础上扩大水田450万亩，1962年扩大到1，200万亩，那时候，全区农村每人可以平均到3亩水田，基本上摆脱了旱灾的威胁。为了实现这一计划，去年入冬以来，晋南人民便开展了一个声势浩大的兴修水利工作，截至目前为止，已经完成小型水利工程473件，正在施工的126件，已经完成的水井10，179眼，正在施工的1，732眼，这些工程完成后，可以扩大灌溉面积40余万亩。
    准备充足的肥料，同样是保证复播丰产的关键。依照今年的播种计划（370万亩棉田，350万亩复播作物，200万亩麦田追肥），全区共需肥2，500万车，目前尚缺1，000万车。解决肥料问题的最根本的办法，就是发动群众大量积自然肥料。去年入冬以来，全区有20万男女青年组织了1万个积肥突击队，展开了轰轰烈烈的积肥工作。洪赵、解虞等县几乎把所有的棉柴和玉米秆都沤了肥。在临猗，在永济，旱茅（厕所）改水茅的工作也在积极地开展。
