Xinhua News Agency, March 29th, Reykjavik Dispatch: The Icelandic Parliament passed a resolution on the 28th by a vote of 31 to 21, demanding the withdrawal of American troops from Iceland.

    During the vote, all members of the Icelandic Socialist Unity Party, the Progressive Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the National Preservation Party unanimously voted in favor. Only members of the Independence Party voted against it. The leader of this party, Prime Minister Thors, submitted his resignation to the President just two days prior. His policy of allowing American troops to maintain bases in Iceland had already caused a rupture in the government coalition.

    The resolution passed by Parliament calls for negotiations with the United States to revise the Iceland-United States treaty signed in 1951. The United States used this treaty to station its troops at the Keflavik Air Force Base near the Icelandic capital.

    This resolution by the Icelandic Parliament has caused unease among American officials. According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington, U.S. officials said this was an unpleasant development. American diplomats believe that "if the Keflavik base ceases operations, NATO will lose some of its best defense facilities."

Xinhua News Agency, March 28th, Reykjavik Dispatch: Icelandic Prime Minister Thors submitted his resignation to the President on March 27th after the coalition government formed by his Independence Party and the Progressive Party split. The current government will continue to govern as a caretaker government until the general election in June.

    The Progressive Party announced its withdrawal from the coalition government in a letter to Thors on the 26th. The Progressive Party took this action after the recently held party congress decided to recall its representatives in the government. The congress stated that due to changes in the international situation, the Progressive Party disagreed with the government's policy of allowing American troops to continue to be stationed in Iceland.

    冰岛议会通过决议要求美国军队撤出冰岛
    新华社29日讯　雷克雅未克消息：冰岛议会二十八日以三十一票对二十一票通过一项决议，要求美国军队撤出冰岛。
    在表决时，冰岛统一社会党、进步党、社会民主党和民族保护党的所有议员一致投票赞成。投反对票的只有独立党的议员，这个党的领袖托尔斯总理刚刚在两天前向总统提出辞呈，他所执行的允许美军在冰岛保持基地的政策已经使得政府联盟发生了破裂。
    议会通过的决议要求同美国举行谈判，以修改1951年签订的冰岛—美国条约。美国就是利用这项条约把它的军队驻扎在冰岛首都附近的凯夫拉维克空军基地的。
    冰岛议会的这项决议已经引起美国官方人士的不安。据路透社华盛顿消息，美国官员们说这是一个不愉快的发展。美国外交人士认为，“如果凯夫拉维克基地停止活动的话，北大西洋公约组织将丧失一些最好的防御机构。”
    新华社28日讯　雷克雅未克消息：冰岛总理托尔斯在他的独立党同进步党组成的联合政府发生分裂以后，在三月二十七日向总统提出辞职。现政府将作为看守政府继续执政直到六月间举行大选为止。
    进步党在二十六日给托尔斯的信中宣布退出联合政府。进步党是在不久以前举行的党代表大会决定召回它在政府中的代表以后采取这个行动的。大会表示，由于国际局势已经发生变化，进步党不同意政府让美军继续驻扎在冰岛的政策。
