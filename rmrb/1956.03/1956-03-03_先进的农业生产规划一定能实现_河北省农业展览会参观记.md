Advanced Agricultural Production Planning Will Definitely Be Realized
    ——A Visit to the Hebei Provincial Agricultural Exhibition——
    Jiang Xia
    These days, people from the capital and farmers from Hebei Province who have come from afar are heading to the Soviet Exhibition Center in the western suburbs of Beijing with excitement to visit the Hebei Provincial Agricultural Exhibition being held here.
    The "Comprehensive Planning" section of the exhibition uses various eye-catching charts to show the will of the people of Hebei Province to complete the agricultural production increase plan of the first five-year plan ahead of schedule and in an all-round way, and to strive to realize the National Agricultural Development Program. Here, visitors can see the inspiring 12-year long-term plan of Hebei Province in agriculture, animal husbandry, aquaculture, greening, fruit trees, agricultural mechanization, eliminating water and drought disasters, hydrological and meteorological station networks, rural cultural networks, postal services, telephones, etc.
    People are most interested in the growth rate of Hebei Province's agricultural production indicators. Hebei Province is one of the important coarse grain and cotton producing areas in the country. Its coarse grain output accounts for one-tenth of the country's total coarse grain output, and its cotton output accounts for one-quarter of the country's total output. We can see from the charts in the comprehensive planning section that in 1955, the yield of grain per mu in Hebei Province was 178 jin, and it will increase to 250 jin in 1956, and the total output can reach 25 billion jin. By 1962, the total output can reach 38 billion jin; by 1967, which is the last year of implementing the Agricultural Development Program, the total output of coarse grains will reach 58.3 billion jin. In 1955, the yield of cotton per mu was 39.1 jin (lint cotton); by 1967, it will gradually increase to 150 jin, and the total output will be about three and a half times that of 1955. Taking the grain and cotton production increase targets of Hebei Province in 1956 alone, it also exceeds the national plan targets by a large margin. In the past, people could not imagine such advanced production increase indicators. Perhaps some people will doubt the possibility of realizing these indicators? Many parts of the exhibition answer such doubts with vivid examples.
    In the agricultural cooperativization section, visitors can see an overview of the development of the cooperativization movement in Hebei Province. In 1945, there were only three elementary agricultural production cooperatives, Geng Changsuo, Gu Fengming, and Guo Yucheng, in Hebei Province. At that time, they could be regarded as "sparks" on the Hebei Plain. In the past ten years, under the correct leadership of the Party, the agricultural cooperativization movement has developed greatly in Hebei Province, reaching its peak in the winter of 1955. The charts in the exhibition show that 23,726 advanced agricultural production cooperatives have been established in the province, and the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives accounts for 98.04% of the total number of peasant households in the province. So far, the small-scale peasant economy of Hebei Province has been sent to the history museum. The change in production relations has liberated the productive forces. Many photos displayed here show the enthusiastic scenes of the vast number of farmers actively digging wells, digging canals, delivering manure, and preparing to welcome the spring plowing under the encouragement of the cooperativization movement. The advanced grain and cotton production increase indicators have the great victory of the cooperativization movement as a solid foundation.
    In the grain production increase section, excellent high-yield crops from Hebei Province are displayed. There is Yinfang japonica rice, "Golden Queen" and "White Horse Tooth" corn that are more than a foot long, huge "Victory No. 100" sweet potatoes, and potatoes that are larger than melons. People look at these products with irrepressible joy. How much can high-yield crops increase production? A chart here explains: in 1955, Hebei Province only expanded 200,000 mu of high-yield crops such as corn, rice, and potatoes, and increased production by 150 million jin of grain. There is a broad prospect for continuing to promote various high-yield crops in Hebei Province in the future.
    There are many low-lying and saline-alkali lands in eastern Hebei Province. Can production be increased in these areas? The exhibition answers this question. Here is an example: Jianchapu Depression in Baxian County is a perennial waterlogged area, and there was little harvest in the past; last year, the Dongtaishan Collective Agricultural Production Cooperative adapted to the water situation and planted Dian rice, which obtained a bumper harvest, with the highest yield reaching 1,048 jin per mu. Examples of increased production due to improving saline-alkali land and increasing land utilization are also exhibited here. These facts make people more convinced of the famous saying of the great soil scientist Williams: "There is no bad land, only bad farming methods."
    Visitors watched the grain crop high-yield list displayed here with respect and admiration. Among the 118 production units listed as typical examples of high-yield grain crops, there are 21 typical examples of high-yield corn with a yield of over 1,000 jin per mu, 10 typical examples of high-yield sweet potatoes with a yield of over 10,000 jin per mu, 17 typical examples of high-yield wheat with a yield of over 500 jin per mu, and 6 typical examples of high-yield rice with a yield of over 1,000 jin per mu; in addition, there are many facts of large-area high yields. These figures show that their high-yield achievements in 1955 have already far outstripped the production increase targets for 1956.
    In the economic crop section of the exhibition, people saw the infinite potential for cotton production increase. Here, a comparison is used to tell people how important cotton close planting and fine pruning are for increasing production. Two clusters of cotton plants are displayed here. One cluster was moved from the contrast field of the Xieshaiyi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Nangong County. Last year, this cooperative planted 4,270 plants per mu and the yield reached 207 jin of seed cotton, while on another mu, it was densely planted to 6,313 plants. As a result, 385 jin of seed cotton were harvested. The other cluster of cotton plants was moved from the Chenguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the second district of Wuji County. Last year, this cooperative pruned 210 mu of cotton fields twice, and harvested 255 jin of seed cotton per mu; another 200 mu of cotton fields achieved fine pruning (7 prunings), and the yield reached 326 jin per mu. Thanks to the efforts of agricultural scientists, new and excellent cotton varieties are constantly emerging. The six new short-fruiting branch varieties exhibited here aroused great interest among the audience. The common characteristics of these new varieties are: early maturity (20 days earlier than Erbi cotton); short fruiting branches, suitable for mechanized farming and close planting, and high yield. With this variety, 7,000 to 8,000 plants can be densely planted per mu. According to experiments, Nangong No. 40 short-fruiting branch cotton harvested 144 jin of seed cotton on one fen of land last year. These vivid examples allow people to clearly see that there is a reliable basis for achieving advanced cotton production increase indicators in Hebei Province.
    Hebei Province is a province with a great lack of trees. Due to the lack of trees, it is not easy to maintain soil and water and prevent wind and sand, and agricultural production is greatly threatened. According to the plan, by 1965, the land in the province will be basically greened. Various trees suitable for planting in Hebei Province are displayed at the exhibition: poplar, locust, willow, oil pine... There are also rows of small-leaved poplar, locust, and purple spike locust transplanted from the sandy wasteland in western Hebei to create shelterbelts. These trees have only been planted for four or five years, and they have initially received the effect of preventing wind and sand. Ten years later, Hebei Province will no longer be a province lacking trees. At that time, the mountainous areas of the province, as well as the sides of houses, roads, villages, and water, will be shaded by green trees and orchards. At that time, trees will not only bring huge benefits to agricultural production, but also make this large plain even more beautiful.
    The adoption of new agricultural tools and agricultural mechanization are also extremely important conditions for realizing the agricultural production increase plan. Various agricultural machines are displayed at the exhibition. Among them are the domestically made boiler-powered machines and many other agricultural machines and new agricultural tools that are widely welcomed by farmers in various places. Before long, domestically made tractors will be galloping on the vast plains of Hebei Province. According to the plan, by 1967, there will be 50,000 (standard units) tractors working in the fields in the rural areas of Hebei Province, and the area of mechanized farming can reach 71%.
    Realizing the advanced grain and cotton production increase plan is certainly not without difficulties. However, the vast number of farmers in Hebei Province are determined to rely on their own hands to overcome these difficulties. The agricultural cooperativization section of the exhibition introduced to the audience the three poor peasant households in Nanwangzhuang, Anping County, who insisted on running the cooperative and were praised as the "direction of 500 million farmers"; and the Jianming Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Xisishilipu Village, Zunhua, who were praised as "the image of our entire country" for their diligence and thrift in running the cooperative. They and the farmers of Hebei Province, under the leadership and support of the Party, overcame all kinds of unimaginable difficulties, and finally achieved a great victory in the cooperativization movement throughout the province. People also have reason to believe that they will also overcome various difficulties on the production front and continue to achieve new victories. The newly built large-scale cooperatives have many difficulties in production, operation, and management. However, many older cooperatives with relatively large scale have created many valuable experiences. The exhibition introduced the complete set of methods of Zhoujiazhuang and other cooperatives in Jin County in this regard, and many visitors were copying these good methods with notebooks in hand.
    The exhibition also introduced many advanced experiences in planting various crops, raising draught animals, raising pigs, improving feed, accumulating fertilizer, etc. These advanced experiences from the masses will surely play a greater role by going from the exhibition to the vast masses again.

    先进的农业生产规划一定能实现
    ——河北省农业展览会参观记——
    江夏
    这几天，首都人民和远道而来的河北省农民怀着兴奋的心情走向北京西郊苏联展览馆，参观在这里举行的河北省农业展览会。
    展览会的“综合规划”部分，以各种醒目的图表，显示了河北省人民为提前超额全面地完成第一个五年计划的农业增产计划和为实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗的意志。在这里，参观者可以看到河北省农业、畜牧、水产、绿化、果树、农业机械化、消灭水旱灾、水文气象站网、农村文化网、邮政、电话等方面的振奋人心的12年远景规划。
    人们最感兴趣的，是河北省农业生产指标的增长速度。河北省是全国重要的杂粮产区和棉产区之一。它的杂粮产量相当全国杂粮产量的十分之一，棉花产量相当于全国总产量的四分之一。我们可以从综合规划部分的图表看到，1955年，河北省粮食每亩产量是178斤，1956年就要增加到250斤，总产量可以达到250亿斤。到1962年，总产量可以达到380亿斤；到1967年，也就是实行农业发展纲要的最后一年，杂粮的总产量将达到583亿斤。1955年，棉花每亩产量是39.1斤（皮棉）；到1967年，将逐年增加到150斤，总产量大约相当于1955年的三倍半。单拿1956年河北省的粮、棉增产指标来说，也超过了国家计划指标很多。这样的先进增产指标，在过去，人们是不能想像的。也许有人会怀疑这些指标实现的可能性吧？展览会的很多部分都用生动的事例回答了这样的怀疑。
    在农业合作化部分，参观者可以看到河北省合作化运动发展的概貌。1945年，河北省全省还只有耿长锁、谷凤鸣、郭玉琛三个初级农业生产合作社。那时它们在河北平原上真可以算是“星星之火”了。十年来，在党的正确领导下，农业合作化运动在河北省有了很大发展，1955年冬季达到了最高峰。展览会上的图表说明，全省已经建立了23，726个高级农业生产合作社，入社农户占全省总农户的98.04％。到此为止，河北省的小农经济已经被送进了历史博物馆。生产关系的改变解放了生产力。这里展出的许多照片，显示着广大农民在合作化运动的鼓舞下积极打井、挖渠、送粪、准备迎接春耕的热烈场面。先进的粮、棉增产指标，是有合作化运动的伟大胜利作为坚实基础的。
    在粮食增产部分，陈列着河北省优良的高产作物。这里有银坊粳稻，有一尺多长的“金皇后”和“白马牙”玉米，有硕大的“胜利百号”甘薯，有比甜瓜还大的马铃薯。人们看着这些产品，有压抑不住的喜悦心情。高产作物究竟能够增产多少？这里有一个图表作了说明：1955年河北省仅扩大20万亩玉米、水稻、马铃薯等高产作物，就增产了15，000万斤粮食。今后继续推广各种高产作物，在河北省有着广阔前途。
    河北省东部有不少低洼地和盐碱地，在这些地区能不能增产？展览会回答了这个问题。这里有一个事例：霸县煎茶铺洼是一个常年积水区，过去很少有收成；去年，东台山集体农业生产合作社适应水势情况种植了淀稻，获得了丰收，产量最高的获得了每亩1，048斤的收成。这里还展出了因改良盐碱地、提高土地利用而获得增产的事例。这些事实使人们更加确信伟大的土壤学家威廉斯的名言：“没有不良的土地，只有不良的耕作方法。”
    参观者以崇敬和羡慕的心情围看陈列在这里的粮食作物丰产榜。在列入粮食作物丰产典型的118个生产单位中，亩产千斤以上的玉米丰产典型就有21个，亩产万斤以上的甘薯丰产典型有10个，亩产500斤以上的小麦丰产典型有17个，亩产千斤以上的稻谷丰产典型有6个；此外，还有不少大面积丰产的事实。这些数字表明，它们1955年的丰产成绩已经远远跑在1956年增产指标的前面了。
    在展览会的经济作物部分，人们看到了棉花增产的无穷潜力。这里用对比的形式告诉人们实行棉花密植和精细整枝对于增产是多么重要。在这里陈列着两簇棉株。一簇是从南宫县谢晒衣农业生产合作社的对比田里原株搬来的。这个社去年一亩种4，270株，产量达到了207斤籽棉，而在另一亩地上密植到6，313株。结果收获了385斤籽棉。另一簇棉株是从无极县二区晨光农业生产合作社原株搬来的。这个社去年有210亩棉田整枝两次，每亩收获了255斤籽棉；另外的200亩棉田由于做到精细整枝（整7次），每亩产量达到了326斤。由于农业科学工作者的努力，新的棉花优良品种不断出现。这里展出的6种短果枝的新品种，引起观众的极大兴趣。这些新品种的共同特点是：成熟期早（比二比棉提前20天成熟）；果枝短，适宜机耕和密植，而且产量很高。用这种品种，每亩可密植7，000到8，000株。根据试验，南宫40号短果枝棉去年在一分地上收获了籽棉144斤。这些生动的事例让人们清楚地看到，在河北省实现先进的棉花增产指标有可靠的根据。
    河北省是一个林木十分缺乏的省份。由于缺少林木，不易保持水土和防止风沙，农业生产受着很大的威胁。根据规划，到1965年，全省的土地就要基本上绿化。在展览会上陈列着适宜在河北地区栽种的各种树木：杨槐、柳树、油松……这里还有一行行从冀西沙荒地区移来的营造防护林的小叶杨、杨槐、紫穗槐。这些树栽种了仅仅四、五年的时间，就初步收到防御风沙的效果了。10年以后的河北省，将不再是一个缺乏树木的省份。那时候，全省的山区以及宅旁、道旁、村旁、水旁，都将是绿树成荫，果木成林。那时候，树木不仅给农业生产带来巨大利益，也将把这一大块平原打扮得更加美丽。
    新式农具的采用和农业机械化，也是实现农业增产计划的极重要的条件。展览会上陈列着各种农业机器。其中有受到各地农民普遍欢迎的我国自制的锅驼机和别的许多机器农具、新式农具。不要多久，河北省的大平原上就要驰骋着我国自制的拖拉机了。根据规划，到1967年，河北省的农村将有5万台（标准台）拖拉机在田间工作，机耕面积可以达到71％。
    实现先进的粮棉增产计划，当然不是没有困难的。但是，河北省广大农民有决心依靠自己的双手来克服这些困难。展览会的农业合作化部分向观众介绍了坚持办社被誉为“5亿农民的方向”的安平县南王庄的3户贫农；勤俭办社被誉为“我们整个国家的形象”的遵化西四十里铺村建明农牧业生产合作社。他们和河北全省的农民，在党的领导和支持下克服了令人难以想像的种种困难，在全省范围内，终于取得了合作化运动的伟大胜利。人们同样有理由相信，他们在生产战线上也将克服各种困难，不断取得新的胜利。新建成的大型社，在生产经营管理上是有许多困难的。可是，不少规模比较大的老社已经创造了许多可贵的经验。展览会上介绍了晋县周家庄等社在这方面的整套的办法，许多参观者拿着小本子在抄写这些好办法。
    展览会上也介绍了许多关于种植各种作物、饲养耕畜、养猪、改良饲料、积肥等方面的先进经验。这些从群众中来的先进经验，通过展览会再到广大群众中去，一定能发挥更大的作用。
