The Shijia District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Neijiang County, Sichuan Province, since the entire district achieved semi-socialist cooperativization, experienced a period of stagnation and chaos in cooperative production due to the lack of experience among most cadres in leading cooperative production. The Shijia District Committee analyzed this situation and concluded that it was inseparable from the district committee's general leadership style. In the past, the main problem with the district committee's leadership in production was that arrangements were not specific, inspections were not timely, and problems could not be resolved quickly. To change this situation, the district committee must abandon general leadership, strengthen specific leadership, and not float on the surface, but go deep down to help the cadres below carry out their work. Last December, most cadres believed that the weather was too cold to do any work. In response, the district committee conducted investigations and research in Shidong Township on how to carry out winter production. It was discovered that the township lacked a lot of fertilizer, land processing had not been carried out, and cattle were not being raised well. Therefore, the district committee helped the branch study the situation, determined the methods, and led the farmers to launch a production campaign of accumulating fertilizer, processing land, and protecting cattle. Subsequently, the district committee convened a joint meeting of branch secretaries, where Shidong Township introduced its experience in carrying out winter production. This was a great help to the branch secretaries of various townships, enabling them to learn specific methods for leading winter production. As a result, various townships quickly launched winter production activities such as accumulating fertilizer, repairing ponds, reclaiming wasteland, processing land, and protecting cattle.

After the winter production campaign was launched, the district committee continued to go deep down to provide specific assistance and guidance to township and cooperative cadres. For example, the Shunjiang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shidong Township, a large cooperative with more than 600 households, suffered from absenteeism and loafing due to unsound labor organization and unreasonable labor remuneration, and no one wanted to do jobs such as wasteland reclamation and land processing. The district committee sent cadres to specifically help the cooperative improve its labor organization and labor remuneration, formulate work plans, and implement a piece-rate system. As a result, the number of workers greatly increased and labor efficiency increased by 30%.

In leading production, the district committee adhered to the system of timely inspection and implemented Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions: solve problems as soon as they arise, and do not let them pile up before making a total solution. Under the influence and supervision of the district committee, various township branches also implemented the system of timely inspection, overcoming the shortcomings of being unfinished, inconsistent, unspecific, and unthorough in the past. For example, the cadres of the Pingyuan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yinxi Township became complacent after formulating production plans and labor allocation plans, and relaxed their specific leadership over production. The township branch promptly inspected the cooperative's production and found that they only had plans but no specific measures to implement them, no specific leadership over production activities, and were severely lacking in funds, fertilizer, and seeds, resulting in very poor preparation for spring plowing. The township branch helped the cooperative review its work and strengthened its specific leadership over the preparation for spring plowing. The township branch also introduced this experience at a meeting of all township cadres, promptly overcoming the complacency among many township cadres and strengthening the preparation for spring plowing throughout the township.

In order to ensure the realization of production plans and increase the effectiveness of production leadership, the district committee also implemented and promoted a leadership method of long-term planning and short-term arrangements throughout the district. After formulating a production plan for a relatively long period of time, this period was divided into several stages, and each stage proposed one or two central tasks based on production needs, mobilizing the masses to concentrate their efforts to complete these central tasks. This highlighted the key points, clarified the center, made it easier to think of specific methods, made it easier for cadres to grasp, and made it easier for the masses to accept. This overcame the shortcomings of having too many tasks, unclear centers, unspecific methods, and difficulty in completing them in the past. Therefore, the masses reflected, "The plans set in the past were for looking at, and the plans set now are for doing."

Because the district committee changed its leadership style, went deep into the cooperatives, conducted timely inspections, and strengthened specific assistance to township and cooperative cadres, township and cooperative cadres also gradually learned how to lead cooperative production from not knowing how to lead cooperative production, giving full play to the superiority of the cooperatives. As a result, the entire district achieved remarkable results in winter production and spring plowing. More than 700 million catties of fertilizer were accumulated in winter, 4,113 mu of land were processed, 562 mu of wasteland were reclaimed, 81 ponds were repaired, and 234 river weirs were built. As soon as the Beginning of Spring passed, various cooperatives planted sugarcane, sweet potato seedlings, and leveled rice paddies on time. Wheat has grown green and strong, rapeseed, peas, and broad beans have blossomed, and everywhere foreshadows a greater harvest this year. Cadres and the masses throughout the district are working hard to strive for a production of 1,000 catties of grain and 10,000 catties of sugarcane per mu.

    区委会要具体地深入地领导生产
    顾宏民　沈杰
    四川省内江县史家区自从全区实现了半社会主义的合作化以后，由于绝大部分干部缺乏领导合作社生产的经验，使合作社的生产一度发生停顿和混乱的情况。中共史家区区委会分析了这种情况，认为这和区委一般化的领导作风是分不开的。过去区委会领导生产的主要毛病是布置不具体，检查不及时，有了问题不能迅速解决。要改变这种情况，区委就要抛弃一般化的领导，加强具体领导，就不能浮在上面，而要深入下去，帮助下面的干部进行工作。去年十二月，一般干部认为天寒地冻，无活可作。区委针对这种情况，就在史东乡作了如何开展冬季生产的调查研究。发现这个乡肥料缺得很多，土地加工没有进行，耕牛养得也不好。于是帮助支部研究了情况，确定了办法，领导农民展开了积肥、土地加工和保护耕牛的生产运动。接着区委召集了支部书记联席会议，由史东乡介绍开展冬季生产的经验。这对各个乡的支部书记是一个很好的帮助，使他们学会了领导冬季生产的具体办法。于是，各个乡都很快展开了积肥、修塘、开荒、土地加工和保护耕牛的冬季生产活动。
    在冬季生产运动开展以后，区委会继续深入下去对乡干部和社干部作具体的帮助和指导。如史东乡顺江农业生产合作社，是个六百多户的大社，由于劳动组织不健全，劳动报酬不合理，存在着旷工和窝工的现象，开荒和土地加工一类的活没人去作。区委就派干部具体帮助这个社改进了劳动组织和劳动报酬，制定了作业计划，实行了按件计工制。结果使出工人数大大增加，劳动效率提高了30％。
    区委会在领导生产中，坚持了及时检查的制度，贯彻执行了毛泽东同志的指示：一有问题就去解决，不要使问题成了堆才去作一次总解决。在区委的影响和督促下，各个乡支部也贯彻执行了及时检查的制度，克服了过去领导生产中的有头无尾，有始无终，不具体，不深入的缺点。比如寅溪乡的平原农业生产合作社的干部在制定了生产计划和劳动力调配计划以后，就自满起来，放松了对生产的具体领导。乡支部及时地检查了这个社的生产，发现他们只有计划，没有实现计划的具体措施，没有对生产活动的具体领导，资金、肥料、种子都很缺乏，春耕生产的准备工作做得很差。乡支部就帮助这个社检查了工作，加强了对春耕生产准备工作的具体领导。乡支部又把这一经验在全乡干部会上作了介绍，及时克服了不少乡干部中的自满情绪，加强了全乡的春耕生产准备工作。
    为了保证生产计划的实现，增加领导生产的效果。区委会还实行了并在全区推广了长计划短安排的领导方法。在制定一个较长时期的生产计划以后，又把这个时期划分为几个阶段，每个阶段都根据生产上的需要提出一两项中心任务，动员群众集中力量完成这一中心任务。这样重点突出，中心明确，办法也容易想得具体，干部容易掌握，群众也容易接受。这就克服了过去任务太多，中心不明确，办法不具体，完成有困难的缺点。因此群众反映说：“过去定的计划是看的，现在定的计划是干的。”
    由于区委会改变了领导作风，深入合作社，及时检查，又加强了对乡的和社的干部的具体帮助，使得乡干部和社干部也从不会领导合作社的生产到逐渐学会领导合作社的生产，充分发挥了合作社的优越性，因此，全区冬季生产和春耕生产取得显著的成绩。冬季积肥七亿多斤，土地加工4，113亩，开荒562亩，修塘81个，扎河堰234道。立春刚过，各个合作社都按时放甘蔗，下苕种，平秧田。小麦已经长得碧绿茁壮，菜籽、豌豆、葫豆已经开花，到处预示着今年会有更大的丰收的景象。全区干部和群众正在为争取每亩地生产千斤粮、万斤蔗而努力。
