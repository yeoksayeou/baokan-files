Many regions across the country are actively developing on-the-job workers' spare-time education.

In Anshan, besides the more than twenty formal spare-time schools from primary to university level, there are also more than one hundred spare-time cultural study classes. Recently, to accommodate workers living in the suburbs of Anshan in their cultural studies, four spare-time cultural center schools have been specially established in the suburbs. More than 48,000 workers in Anshan are participating in spare-time learning. In Heilongjiang Province, factories and mines have established 572 on-the-job workers' spare-time schools, with a total of more than 49,000 workers participating in learning. In Yunnan Province, more than 75% of workers in factories and mining enterprises are participating in spare-time cultural studies. In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, there are sixty-seven on-the-job workers' spare-time schools, with more than 33,000 workers participating in spare-time learning.

Various regions attach great importance to running on-the-job workers' spare-time education well. Factories and mining enterprises in Jilin Province have allocated a certain number of full-time teachers and directors of studies according to the proportion of students, and some units have also allocated full-time principals. Many factories and mining enterprises in various regions have taken specific measures to ensure workers' spare-time study time. Qingdao No. 7 State-owned Cotton Textile Factory has expanded its nurseries to enable female workers with children to concentrate on their studies, so that female workers can leave their children in the nurseries during study time and study culture with peace of mind.

    全国许多地区积极开展职工业余教育。
    鞍山市，目前除了有二十多个从小学到大学的正规业余学校以外，还有一百多个业余文化学习班；最近为了照顾住在鞍山郊区的工人学习文化，特别在郊区举办了四个业余文化中心学校。鞍山市有四万八千多职工参加了业余学习。在黑龙江省，工厂、矿山举办的职工业余学校有572所，参加学习的职工共四万九千多人。在云南省，工厂矿山企业中有75％以上的职工参加了业余文化学习，内蒙古自治区有六十七所职工业余学校，参加业余学习的职工有三万三千多人。
    各地对办好职工业余教育非常重视。吉林省的各个工厂矿山企业按照学员比例配备了一定数量的专职教师和教导主任，部分单位还配备了专职校长。各地许多工厂矿山企业都采取具体措施，保证职工业余学习时间，国营青岛第七棉纺织厂为了使有孩子的女工能够专心学习，还扩大了托儿所，使女工们在学习时间内能把孩子寄托在托儿所内，安心学习文化。
