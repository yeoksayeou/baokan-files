To the Editor:

    A production upsurge unprecedented in history has emerged in Yuci Special District, Shanxi Province, this past winter and spring. 85% of the district's labor force has been投入了紧张的冬季生产. According to incomplete statistics from 21 counties in the district from October last year to the end of January this year, 3,907 wells have been dug, and 6,006 are under construction, which is 40 times the total number of wells dug in the entire year of 1954. 1,758 water channels have been completed, and 1,386 are under construction. A total of 283 flood control projects have been completed or are under construction. Agricultural infrastructure construction such as damming, building silt ponds, repairing gullies, building terraces, and cultivating field ridges is also being carried out on a large scale. After the completion of these projects, more than 470,000 mu of irrigated land can be expanded, more than 130,000 mu of land can be silted up, more than 270,000 mu of land can be conserved, and soil erosion can be controlled in an area of about 3.52 million mu. In this way, the district can increase grain production by more than 136.68 million jin this year.

    However, because the leading organs in some areas neglected the education of safe production in such a large-scale mass production upsurge, and because the labor organization was relatively chaotic after some agricultural cooperatives merged into large cooperatives, serious casualties occurred continuously. For example, in the basic construction of the Hanzhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Shouyang County, a member was crushed to death by a collapsed retaining wall due to negligence. When Zhangshanyu Township in Pingding County organized the entire township to carry out soil and water conservation, one member was crushed to death and one was injured due to the collapse of soil and stone slag. In Lingshi and other counties, accidents of mutual abrasion occurred during labor due to chaotic labor organization and rushing to work. Some agricultural production cooperatives in some areas did not pay attention to the physiological characteristics of women and allowed women to participate in excessively heavy physical labor, which affected women's health.

    In order to prevent such accidents, rural workers in various places should carry out specific and in-depth education on safe production for farmers, and help agricultural production cooperatives quickly do a good job in labor management, rectify labor organizations, and establish safety equipment and a responsibility system for safe production to ensure safe production. When agricultural cooperatives carry out large-scale basic construction projects, they must not blindly construct; they should submit the plan to the relevant departments for review in advance, and carry out construction after obtaining the guidance and assistance of the technical personnel of the relevant departments.

    在农业基本建设中要注意安全生产编辑同志：
    山西省榆次专区在去冬今春出现了一个史无前例的生产高潮。全区有85％的劳动力投入了紧张的冬季生产。据全区21个县从去年10月到今年1月底不完全的统计，水井已打成3，907眼，正在施工的6，006眼，等于1954年全年打井总数的40倍；水渠已完成1，758道，正在施工的1，386道；已经完成的和正在动工的防洪工程共283件；打坝、打泊池、修谷坊、闸山沟、修梯田、培地埂等农业基本建设也正在大量进行着。这些工程完成以后，可以扩大水地47万多亩，淤地13万多亩，保墒27万多亩，控制水土流失面积约352万亩。这样，今年全区就可以增产粮食13，668万多斤。
    但是，由于某些地区的领导机关在这样一个规模巨大的群众性的生产高潮中忽视了安全生产的教育，加上一部分农业社并成大社以后劳动组织比较混乱，因而连续发生了严重的伤亡事故。例如，寿阳县韩庄农业社在基本建设中，因为疏忽大意，塄土塌下压死了一个社员。平定县张山峪乡在组织全乡进行水土保持闸山沟地的时候，因为土石渣塌下，压死、压伤社员各一人。灵石等县因为劳动组织混乱，做活一窝蜂，以致在劳动过程中发生相互锉伤的事故。还有一些地区的农业生产合作社没有注意照顾妇女生理上的特点，让妇女参加了过重的体力劳动，以致影响到妇女的健康。
    为了杜绝这类事故，各地农村工作人员应该具体而深入地向农民进行安全生产的教育，并且帮助农业生产合作社迅速作好劳动管理工作，把劳动组织整顿好，建立好安全设备和安全生产的责任制度，保证安全地进行生产。农业社在进行较大的基本建设工程的时候，决不要盲目施工；应该事先把计划提交有关部门审查，得到有关部门技术人员的指导帮助后再施工。
