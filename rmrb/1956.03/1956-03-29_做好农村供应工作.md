Doing a Good Job in Rural Supply Work
Zeng Chuanliu, Vice Minister of Commerce

Over the past year, China's department stores have achieved certain successes, basically meeting the people's needs for daily-use merchandise and accumulating capital for the country. However, there are still many shortcomings and problems in the work of department stores. In 1955, department stores only completed 91.61% of their sales plan. Coupled with numerous issues in business management, various plans were not fulfilled.

There are many reasons why the department stores' plans could not be completed, but the fundamental problem is that the thinking of the staff lags behind reality. Many comrades do not have a clear understanding of the idea of being responsible to consumers and serving them comprehensively. They have not actively supplied the goods that people need, especially those needed by farmers, in a timely manner. Many commodities are in ample stock, but the people's needs are not being met.

The countryside is a vast market for daily-use industrial products. In terms of population, farmers account for 85% of the national population. In terms of purchasing power for daily-use merchandise, it accounts for about 70% of the annual sales of the department store system. In terms of the economic life of farmers, since liberation, the productivity of the vast number of farmers has been increasing day by day, their material lives have been continuously improving, and their need for many daily-use merchandise has greatly increased. In order to meet the material needs of farmers and continuously improve their lives, state-owned commercial departments must do a good job in supplying industrial products to rural areas and meeting the needs of farmers.

However, we still have many shortcomings in supplying the daily-use merchandise that farmers need. For example, after the autumn harvest last year, when agricultural products were concentrated on the market and the market entered its peak season, many areas experienced shortages of goods just when farmers needed to purchase the goods they needed. Some of the goods that were out of stock were small commodities, and some were major commodities with large inventories in the department store system.

How do grassroots stores in many areas carry out rural supply work? Some supply what they have, and if they don't have it, they don't supply it. Or they supply whatever they have, and supply as much as they have. For example, the Fengcheng Wholesale Store in Liaoning Province only had 103 dozen sweaters in mid-September last year, which was the same as the inventory at the beginning of the year. There were only ten varieties, and there were only tops and no pants. The store simply did not prepare the open-front sweaters that farmers liked. Some stores do not organize the supply of goods needed by farmers in a timely manner, but blindly transfer goods that farmers do not need or that are not currently suitable for the consumption level of farmers. For example, stores did not organize the supply of "揽油" and "工农" soaps costing a little over a dime a piece, red cotton yarn socks, etc. The supply of goods for women and children, in particular, was very limited. Some stores blindly purchased goods that are currently not marketable in rural areas, such as transferring chocolate candies to Huimin, Shandong, and high-heeled leather shoes to Jining, Qinghai. Although some stores transferred in some goods suitable for local sales, the salespersons were afraid of "trouble" if there were too many goods. Some stores were even afraid that having marketable goods would affect the "sales" of unmarketable goods, so they kept the marketable goods in the warehouse and did not sell them to farmers. In some areas, the supply of some goods that could be supplied in large quantities was not released. In a situation where farmers are busy with production and need to buy goods, many stores still "wait for customers to come to the door" instead of changing their supply methods in a timely manner.

These phenomena show that the state-owned commercial departments in many areas cannot deeply understand the close relationship between doing a good job in rural supply work and improving the material lives of farmers, and cannot fully recognize the great significance of supplying farmers with large quantities of industrial products in exchange for marketable grain, light industrial raw materials, and non-staple foods. Sales and purchasing departments often do not pay attention to the development and changes in the rural market, and do not actively and promptly organize supply according to the needs of farmers to meet their growing needs. This inevitably leads to many commodities being unmarketable, many commodities being both overstocked and out of stock, and many commodities not being able to be supplied to farmers in a timely manner.

The advent of the high tide of agricultural cooperation and the promulgation of the "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) from 1956 to 1967" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China have fundamentally changed the face of the rural market. Agricultural producers' cooperatives have become the center of political and economic activities in rural areas, and the laws of activity of agricultural producers' cooperatives affect the changes in the laws of the rural market, which will inevitably have a profound impact on commercial work. It must be recognized that the tremendous changes in the needs of more than 500 million farmers for commodities is a major event in commercial work. How to grasp the laws of changes in the rural market, overcome the shortcomings in the work, and do a good job in the supply work is an important task placed in front of commercial workers, and it is also an important task that must be completed. In order to accomplish this task, the following tasks must be done conscientiously:

1.  Constantly investigate the needs of farmers. Ensuring that commodities are suitable for the needs of farmers is the basic key to doing a good job in supply work. The investigation and research work should be regular, and different methods should be used, such as conducting typical investigations, visiting agricultural producers' cooperatives, holding commodity exhibitions, and holding forums for rural youth and women. It should be carried out in a planned manner according to the specific conditions of the locality, in conjunction with supply and marketing cooperatives and jointly-operated, agency-sale, distribution, and cooperative department stores. Then, according to the needs of farmers, organize the supply of goods correctly.

The department stores at the county level must conscientiously compile purchase plans (including plans for varieties and amounts) according to the needs of farmers, and ensure that the compiled plans are linked to the requisition plans of the supply and marketing cooperatives and the department store retail stores that have been jointly operated, agency-sold, distributed, and cooperatized, and then organize the purchase of goods according to the plans. The supply departments should resolutely implement the principle that "industrial products needed by both cities and rural areas should be given priority to supply to rural areas." In terms of commodity distribution methods, we should further implement the method of "combining requisition of goods from below and distribution from above," and constantly summarize experience to improve the quality of work. The method of allocating goods according to administrative divisions should be corrected, and grassroots stores can choose the location of purchase according to the commodity circulation routes.

2.  Further improve and strengthen wholesale work. First-level purchasing and supply stations and other second-level stations with purchasing tasks must ensure that the varieties and colors of the purchased goods are suitable for local needs, implement the policy of pricing according to quality, and conscientiously carry out the trial production and trial sales of new commodities. Purchasing units should, as far as possible, fully meet the requirements of each requisitioning unit for the varieties, specifications, and colors of commodities, and do everything possible to organize the varieties required by the sales units to meet the supply. Grassroots sales units should mainly do a good job in expanding the distribution of industrial products to the countryside, and ensure that the varieties and colors of industrial products are suitable for the needs of local consumers.

In order to do a good job in rural supply work, the grassroots units of state-owned commerce must also maintain close contact with the supply and marketing cooperatives, regularly convene supply meetings, supplementary requisition meetings, and commodity exchange meetings, and invite local handicraft departments to participate, sign supply contracts according to the requisition plans submitted by the supply and marketing cooperatives, and supply various commodities in a timely manner. When necessary, they can also send special personnel to the supply and marketing cooperatives to promote sales, so that the supply and marketing cooperatives can choose commodities that are marketable in rural areas to ensure rural supply.

3.  We must attach importance to and do a good job in the supply of small commodities. With the continuous improvement of farmers' purchasing power and the changes in the economic status of women after they generally participate in labor, the number of small commodities needed in rural areas will increase day by day. State-owned commercial departments must increase the variety of small commodities they operate according to the needs of local farmers to meet the diverse needs of the people, and prevent the phenomenon of simply seeking convenience in operation or嫌small commodities selling for less money and not actively operating.

In order to ensure that grassroots stores do a good job in the operation of small commodities, grassroots units should reserve 10% to 20% of the total purchase amount as funds for the free purchase of small commodities to ensure the normal supply of small commodities.

4.  The institutions of state-owned commerce should be rapidly established in counties and key market towns below the county level. This will better organize commodity circulation and meet the needs of farmers for industrial products. Grassroots stores should ensure that commodities are more complete, and commodity reserves should be suitable for the needs of expanding commodity circulation.

5.  Improve supply methods to facilitate farmers' purchases. After agricultural producers' cooperatives reasonably organized labor, many farmers demanded "door-to-door delivery." Last year, some units combined with the supply and marketing cooperatives to implement the method of "exhibition and sales" to production cooperatives (that is, "door-to-door delivery, exhibition in different places, selection by members, and unified accounting within the cooperative"), which was welcomed by farmers. Some units, in conjunction with the supply and marketing cooperatives, adopted methods such as "pre-ordering goods" to supply the industrial products needed by farmers in a timely manner. These experiences are worth promoting. At the same time, we should further create more and better supply methods welcomed by farmers, summarize experience, and promote them.

    做好农村供应工作
    商业部副部长　曾传六
    一年以来，中国百货公司的工作取得了一定的成绩，基本上满足了人民对日用百货的需要，为国家积累了资金。但是，百货公司的工作还有很多缺点和问题。1955年百货公司的销售计划只完成91.61％，加上经营管理上有不少问题，以致各项计划都没有完成。
    百货公司各项计划不能完成的原因是多方面的，但是根本问题是由于工作人员的思想落后于实际。不少同志对消费者负责、全面地为消费者服务的思想不够明确，没有积极地把人民需要、特别是农民需要的商品及时供应好。许多商品库存相当充裕，但人民的需要却得不到满足。
    农村是日用工业品的广阔市场。就人数来说，农民占全国人口的85％；就日用百货的购买力来说，约占百货系统全年卖钱额的70％左右；就农民的经济生活情况来说，解放几年来，广大农民的生产力日益提高，物质生活不断改善，对许多日用百货的需要大大增加。为了满足农民物质生活的需要，不断地改善农民的生活，国营商业部门必须做好农村工业品的供应工作，满足农民的需要。
    但是，我们对农民所需要的日用百货的供应工作还有很多缺点。比如去年秋收以后，农产品集中上市，市场进入了旺季，正当农民需要购进他们所需要的商品的时候，许多地区发生了商品脱销现象。脱销的商品中有些是小百货，有些是百货系统库存很大的主要商品。
    许多地区的基层商店是怎样进行农村供应工作的呢？有的是有就供应，没有就不供应，或者是有什么就供应什么，有多少就供应多少。例如辽宁凤城批发商店，去年九月中旬绒衣只有年初的存货103打，品种只有十种，而且有上衣、没有裤子，农民喜爱的开襟绒衣，商店根本就没有准备。有的商店对农民需要的商品不及时组织供应，农民不需要或者目前还不适合农民消费水平的商品，反而盲目调去了。例如农村需要的一角多钱一块的“揽油”、“工农”香皂、红棉纱袜子等，商店都没有组织供应，特别是妇女、儿童的用品供应得很少。有的商店却盲目购进了目前农村根本不适销的商品，如把巧克力糖调到山东惠民，高跟皮鞋调到青海集宁。有的商店虽然调进了一些适合当地销售的商品，但是售货员怕商品多了“麻烦”；有的商店甚至怕有了适销商品影响不适销商品的“销售”，把适销商品放在仓库里不卖给农民。某些地区对有些可以大量供应的商品，没有放手供应。在农民忙于生产而又需要购买商品的情况下，许多商店仍然“等客上门”，而不是及时改变供应的方法。
    这些现象说明了许多地区的国营商业部门不能深刻地了解做好农村供应工作同改善农民物质生活的密切关系，不能很好地认识供应农民大量的工业品换取商品粮食、轻工业原料和副食品的重大意义。销售和采购部门往往不注意农村市场的发展和变化，不根据农民的需要，积极地及时组织供应，来满足农民日益增长的需要，这样就必然使许多商品不适销，许多商品一面积压、一面脱销，许多商品不能及时供应给农民。
    农业合作化高潮的到来和中共中央颁布了“1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）”，根本改变了农村市场的面貌。农业生产合作社已经成为农村中政治经济活动的中心，农业生产合作社的活动规律影响着农村市场规律的变化，对商业工作必将引起深刻的影响。要认识到五亿多农民对商品需要发生的巨大变化，是商业工作中的一件大事。如何掌握农村市场变化的规律，克服工作中的缺点，做好供应工作，是摆在商业工作者面前的一项重要课题，也是必须完成的重要任务。为了完成这一任务，就要认真地做好以下的工作：
    一、经常地调查农民的需要。保证商品能适合农民需要是做好供应工作的基本关键。调查研究工作要经常，而且要采用典型调查、到农业生产合作社访问、举行商品展览会、召开农村青年、妇女座谈会等不同的方法来进行；应该根据当地的具体情况，结合供销合作社和公私合营商店，有计划地分别进行；再根据农民需要，正确地组织货源。
    县一级的百货商店必须根据农民的需要认真编报进货计划（包括品种、金额的计划），并且要使编造的计划同供销合作社、已经合营、代销、经销、合作化的百货零售商店的要货计划衔接起来，再按照计划组织进货。供应部门应该坚决贯彻执行“城市和农村都需要的工业品，应该优先地供应农村”的原则。在商品分配的方法上，应该进一步贯彻执行“自下而上的要货和自上而下的分配相结合”的办法，并且随时总结经验，以提高工作质量。要纠正按行政区划调拨商品的办法，基层商店进货可以根据商品流转路线选择进货地点。
    二、进一步改进和加强批发工作。一级采购供应站及其他有采购任务的二级站，要使采购的商品的品种、花色能适合当地需要，要贯彻执行按质论价的政策，和认真进行新商品的试制试销工作。采购单位对商品的品种、规格、花色，应该尽可能充分满足各要货单位的要求，尽一切力量组织销售单位所要的品种来满足供应。基层销货单位，主要应该做好扩大工业品下乡的工作，并且要使工业品的品种、花色适合当地消费者的需要。
    要做好农村供应工作，国营商业的基层单位还必须经常同供销合作社保持密切联系，定期召集供应会议、补充要货会议、商品交流会，并且邀请当地手工业部门参加，按供销合作社所提要货计划，订立供应合同，及时供应各种商品。必要的时候并且可派专人带货到供销合作社推销，使供销合作社能够选择适销农村的商品，以保证农村供应。
    三、要重视和做好小百货的供应工作。随着农民购买力的不断提高和妇女普遍参加劳动以后经济地位的变化，农村小百货的需要数量将日益增多。国营商业部门必须根据当地农民的需要，增加小百货的经营品种，来满足人民多种多样的需要，防止单纯贪图经营方便或嫌小百货卖钱少而不积极经营的现象发生。
    为了保证基层商店做好小百货的经营，基层单位应该在总进货额内保留10％到20％作为自由采购小百货的资金，以保证小百货的正常供应。
    四、国营商业的机构要迅速地设置到县和县以下的重点集镇。这样才能更好地组织商品流转，满足农民对工业品的需要。基层商店应该保证商品更加齐全，商品的储备要适合于扩大商品流转的需要。
    五、改进供应方法，便利农民购买。农业生产合作社合理地组织了劳动力以后，许多农民都要求“送货上门”。去年有些单位结合供销合作社实行了到生产合作社“展览推销”的办法（就是“送货上门，分处展览，社员选购，社内统一算账”），农民都很欢迎。有些单位结合供销合作社采用“预约定货”等办法，及时地供应了农民需要的工业品。这些经验都值得推广。同时要进一步创造更多更好的为农民欢迎的供应方法，总结经验，加以推广。
