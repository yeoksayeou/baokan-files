Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 21st. Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China, and his entourage, left Moscow by train on March 20th to return home.

Those who saw him off at the station included: First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Kaganovich; First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the USSR, Molotov; First Deputy Minister of Defense of the USSR, Marshal of the Soviet Union, Konev; Chairman of the Moscow Soviet, Bobrovnikov, and others.

Liu Xiao, the Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, embassy staff, and many foreign diplomatic envoys to the Soviet Union also came to the station to see him off.

After reviewing the guard of honor, Zhu De delivered a farewell speech on the platform. He said: Dear Comrades, Friends!

I have had the opportunity to visit the great Soviet Union this time, and together with several other comrades, I was dispatched by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to participate in the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which has great historical significance. This is a great honor and pleasure in my life. Now, as we are about to leave Moscow, please allow me to express my deep gratitude to you and the Soviet people for your extremely friendly and warm reception.

The resolutions passed by the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which concluded not long ago, and the report made by Comrade Khrushchev on behalf of the Central Committee at the Congress, are of extremely great significance not only for the Soviet people's struggle to build communism, but also for the people of fraternal countries' struggle to build socialism, and for the struggle of the broad masses of people in all countries of the world for peace and progress.

After the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, I visited various parts of the Soviet Union and witnessed with my own eyes the unforgettable scene of the Soviet people closely united around their own Communist Party, striving with great enthusiasm to complete the various tasks put forward by the 20th Party Congress. The Soviet people, confident in their own great strength in creating history, confident in the wise and correct collective leadership of the Lenin-style Central Committee of their Communist Party, are marching towards the great goal of building a communist society with even greater confidence and奮發effort. I believe that on this road, the Soviet people will move from victory to new and greater victories, thereby making new and even greater contributions to the world's mankind.

Everywhere in Moscow and throughout the Soviet Union, we felt and received the incomparably profound fraternal friendship that the Soviet people expressed towards the Chinese people. I am convinced that this is a manifestation of the increasingly strengthened and developed unbreakable fraternal alliance between the Soviet and Chinese peoples. This friendship and solidarity between the Soviet and Chinese peoples, as well as the friendship and solidarity of the world's forces of peace, democracy, and socialism, is the guarantee of the victory of the cause of peace and the cause of socialism.

Dear Comrades, as I now bid farewell to you, I would like to wish you and the Soviet people greater achievements in the struggle to build communism and safeguard world peace.

Long live the unbreakable unity and cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people!
Long live the unity and cooperation of the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism headed by the Soviet Union!
Long live world peace!

After Vice Chairman Zhu De finished speaking, he shook hands with the well-wishers one by one. Finally, the train slowly left the station to the sound of military music. Fomin, the Chief of Protocol of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, will accompany Vice Chairman Zhu De to the Soviet border.

    朱德副主席离莫斯科回国
    并发表了告别演说
    新华社莫斯科21日电　中华人民共和国副主席朱德和他的随行人员，在三月二十日乘火车离开莫斯科回国。
    到车站欢送的有：苏联部长会议第一副主席卡冈诺维奇，苏联部长会议第一副主席兼外交部长莫洛托夫，苏联国防部第一副部长、苏联元帅科?夫，莫斯科市苏维埃主席波布罗夫尼科夫等。
    中国驻苏联大使刘晓和大使馆人员以及许多国家驻苏联的外交使节也到车站欢送。
    朱德在检阅了仪仗队以后，在月台上发表了告别演说。他说：亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    我这次有机会访问了伟大的苏联，并且和其他几位同志一起，受中国共产党中央委员会的派遣，参加了具有伟大历史意义的苏联共产党第二十次代表大会，是生平极大的荣幸和愉快。现在，当我们就要离开莫斯科的时候，请让我对你们和苏联人民所给予我们的极为友爱和热情的接待，表示深深的感谢。
    在不久以前结束的苏联共产党第二十次代表大会所通过的决议和赫鲁晓夫同志代表中央委员会在大会所作的报告，不仅仅对于苏联人民建设共产主义的斗争有极其巨大的意义，而且对于各兄弟国家人民建设社会主义的斗争，对于世界各国广大人民争取和平和进步的斗争，也作了极其重大的贡献。
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会以后，我曾经到苏联各地参观，亲眼看到苏联人民紧密地团结在自己的共产党的周围，以极大的热情为完成第二十次党代表大会所提出的各项任务而奋斗的令人难忘的情景。苏联人民由于确信自己的创造历史的伟大力量，确信自己的共产党的列宁式的中央委员会的卓著成效的集体领导的英明和正确，而更加满怀信心和奋发努力地向着建成共产主义社会的伟大目标迈进。我相信，在这条道路上，苏联人民将从胜利走向新的更大的胜利，从而对于世界人类作出新的更加伟大的贡献。
    我们在莫斯科和苏联各地，到处都感觉和领受到了苏联人民对中国人民所表示的无比深厚的兄弟情谊。我确信这是苏中两国人民的牢不可破的兄弟联盟日益加强和发展的一种表现。苏中人民间的这种友谊和团结，以及全世界和平、民主和社会主义力量的友谊和团结，就是和平事业和社会主义事业胜利的保证。
    亲爱的同志们，当我现在向你们告别的时候，我谨祝你们和苏联人民在建设共产主义和维护世界和平的斗争中获得更大的成就。
    中苏两国人民之间牢不可破的团结和合作万岁！
    以苏联为首的和平、民主和社会主义力量的团结和合作万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
    朱德副主席讲话完毕以后，同送行者一一握别。最后，列车在军乐声中徐徐离站。苏联最高苏维埃主席团礼宾长弗明将同车伴送朱德副主席到苏联边境。
