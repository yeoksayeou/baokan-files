Preventing Grain from Molding and Deteriorating

Some staff members in grain warehouses and grain purchasing and sales stations in Liaoning Province are negligent in their grain storage work. They believe that "the grain stored last winter has little moisture, and it won't spoil because it was cold in the winter," so they did not promptly inspect the safety of the stored grain, resulting in some of the stored grain becoming moldy and deteriorating. In the No. 1 Grain Depot of Haicheng County, the grain in four grain stacks was moldy, and the grain in one grain stack had already sprouted. More than 1,000 kilograms of corn in the Pailou District Purchasing and Sales Station of this county also became heated and deteriorated.

In grain storage work, one must not be negligent or blindly optimistic at any time. Now that the weather is gradually warming up, grain is prone to moisture absorption and mold, and grain storage departments in various regions should pay special attention to strengthening inspections of grain safety to prevent grain spoilage accidents.

    防止粮食霉烂变质
    辽宁省有些粮食仓库和粮食购销站的工作人员，对于粮食保管工作麻痹大意。他们认为“去年冬天存的粮食水分不大，冬天冷，坏不了粮”，没有及时检查存粮安全情况，以致部分存粮发生了霉烂变质的现象。海城县第一粮库有四个粮囤里的粮食发霉，有一个粮囤里的粮食已经长芽。这个县的牌楼区购销站也有1，000多斤玉米发热变质。
    在粮食保管工作中，任何时候都不能麻痹大意，盲目乐观。现在天气渐暖，粮食容易反潮霉烂，各地粮食保管部门对粮食安全的情况要特别注意加强检查，防止发生坏粮事故。
