Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 19th—The Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front actively protects fishery production.

    During the fishing season, People's Navy flotillas frequently patrol around the fishing grounds. When fishermen go out to sea to fish, coastal artillery and anti-aircraft artillery units also increase their on-duty firepower. An anti-aircraft artillery unit stationed in a certain area of Jinjiang County shot down and damaged six Chiang Kai-shek aircraft during the winter operation to protect fishermen. When fishermen from Fengwei Township, Hui'an County, Fujian Province, returned from fishing at the Zhoushan Islands fishing grounds in Zhejiang Province, they were chased by two Chiang Kai-shek warships in the northeast sea of Fujian. The People's Navy flotilla immediately went to sea and defeated the Chiang Kai-shek warships, protecting the lives and property of the fishermen from loss.
