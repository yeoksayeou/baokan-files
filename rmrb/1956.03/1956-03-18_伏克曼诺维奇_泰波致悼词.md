    Vukmanović-Tempo's Eulogy

    Comrade Vukmanović-Tempo, head of the Yugoslav delegation, delivered a eulogy at the memorial service for Comrade Beirut held in Warsaw.

    Vukmanović-Tempo said, I would like to bid farewell to Comrade Beirut on behalf of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, the working class and all the people of Yugoslavia. As we bid farewell to Comrade Beirut, we cannot help but recall the history of the Polish people, who have a fine tradition of love of freedom and revolution. The sons of Poland fought not only on the land of their motherland, but also in foreign countries, for freedom and independence, for the rights of the working people, and for the happy future of mankind.

    Vukmanović-Tempo concluded by saying that Comrade Beirut has left us at a time when the possibility of consolidating peace and developing cooperation among the people of all countries in the world has emerged, and such a prospect is in sight, when it is already possible to use modern scientific and technological achievements to improve life.

    Comrade Beirut left us at a time when the prospect of cooperation among various socialist movements on the basis of Leninist principles has emerged, and when new possibilities for realizing the ideas of the Great October Revolution through different paths have emerged and continue to emerge.

    Prospects have opened up, and possibilities have arisen. But in order to realize them, in addition to fighting spirit and self-sacrifice, we also need revolutionary principles, thoroughness in action, and Marxist-Leninist ideology.

    伏克曼诺维奇—泰波致悼词
    南斯拉夫代表团团长伏克曼诺维奇—泰波同志在华沙举行的贝鲁特同志的追悼大会上致了悼词。
    伏克曼诺维奇—泰波说，我谨代表南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟中央委员会、南斯拉夫的工人阶级和全体人民来向贝鲁特同志告别。我们在同贝鲁特同志告别的时候，不由得想起具有优良的爱好自由和革命的传统的波兰人民的历史，波兰人民的儿子不仅在祖国的土地上，而且在外国为争取自由和独立、争取劳动人民的权利、争取人类幸福的未来而斗争。
    伏克曼诺维奇—泰波最后说，当巩固和平和发展全世界各国人民的合作的可能性已经产生、这种远景已经在望的时候，当已经有可能利用现代科学和技术上的成就来改善生活的时候，贝鲁特同志离开了我们。
    当各种社会主义运动在列宁主义原则的基础上实行合作的远景已经产生的时候，当通过不同的道路来实现伟大十月革命的思想的新的可能性出现并且不断产生的时候，贝鲁特同志离开了我们。
    远景打开了，可能性产生了。但是为了实现它们，除了战斗力和自我牺牲精神以外，我们还需要革命的原则性、行动的彻底性和马克思列宁的思想性。
