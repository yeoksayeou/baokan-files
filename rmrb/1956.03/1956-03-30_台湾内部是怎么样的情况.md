Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 28th.

The "Delhi Times" weekly published an article on March 19 entitled "What is the Internal Situation in Taiwan?" This article exposes the situation of the Taiwanese people resisting the brutal rule of the U.S.-Chiang clique and yearning to return to the embrace of the motherland.

According to the editor's note of the "Delhi Times," this article was written by an official in Chiang Kai-shek's police force. "This official is not a sympathizer with communism. However, he is deeply disgusted with the actual situation inside Taiwan and believes that Chiang Kai-shek and his friends have completely failed."

If a traveler goes to Taiwan for even the briefest trip, the first thing he will notice is the restricted areas, barbed wire, and sentry posts everywhere, as well as the police cars that can be seen on every road. Even in the smallest towns or villages, it is not easy to avoid encountering patrols of military police or civil police in American olive-green uniforms. What is the reason for this strict guard on the island's settlements and roads? What is the purpose of this careful patrol?

The answer is that Chiang Kai-shek does not trust the Taiwanese people.

Taiwan now has a population of approximately 9.7 million. Among them, Chiang Kai-shek's army and his other subordinates account for 600,000. The rest are Taiwanese natives and immigrants from the mainland who settled here a long time ago. Chiang Kai-shek does not trust these people and regards each of them as a deadly enemy of his regime.

Taiwanese people oppose Chiang Kai-shek

In fact, it is even difficult to find a person on this island who supports Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang Kai-shek's followers and the Taiwanese people are engaged in fierce struggles, both open and underground, here day and night. This struggle, or rather, this resistance, is manifested in the fact that Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers cannot get a cup of water in the villages unless they threaten to use force. This resistance is also manifested in the bloody conflicts that often lead to real rebellions.

In the spring of 1955, the author of this article was ordered to testify in the trial of the case of eight soldiers and one officer who were killed in the Keelung area. Local residents destroyed a car with a handmade landmine and killed the officers and soldiers on board. During the trial, the defendants openly stated that they hated the occupying regime established on this island and were fully determined to fight for the liberation of Taiwan and the reunification of the island they lived on with the whole of China.

Conflicts with Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers and American soldiers have become very frequent. This is common knowledge, although newspapers published in Taiwan never report it. For example, in the first half of 1955 alone, approximately 450 officers and soldiers of Chiang Kai-shek and the United States were killed or injured.

Slaughtering residents

Needless to say, Chiang Kai-shek's government has taken very strict measures to suppress the resistance of the residents. Last summer, I personally witnessed a real battle between regular troops and the residents of three villages in Kaohsiung, who revolted against the rule of Taipei. Two officers from the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group participated in leading the battle to suppress these rebels. On their advice, these villages were bombarded. After the peasants' houses were set on fire and the villages were completely burned, the rebels were forced to stop resisting. The villagers were wiped out, leaving no one alive. The executions were followed by indescribable acts of cruelty, the thought of which still makes me shudder even now, far away from Taiwan. Old men and women were shot at the muzzles of cannons, just as colonizers in other Asian countries often did when suppressing mutinies. Many villagers were hanged in the central square and on the trees along the street. Even now, the image of a tall mulberry tree bearing "evil fruit" often appears in my mind. On the orders of an officer, six people were hanged at the same time. I could not bear this terrible sight and tried to object to this atrocity, but I only earned the ridicule of our officers and the American officers. This incident probably strengthened my determination to break with the Chiang Kai-shek regime.

Strengthened police and military patrols now supervise law and order inside Taiwan to prevent similar incidents from happening again. But this is of no use. The fighting continues. This makes the chairman and his American advisers very uneasy. It is worth noting that Chiang Kai-shek does not dare to use native youths to replenish his army. Taiwanese youths ordered to participate in special labor camps are only doing physical labor. They only dare to give them shovels and hoes, but they are not confident enough to give them weapons.

"Chairman" loses faith in the army

Chiang Kai-shek has no faith among the people on the island. And what is even worse, he is losing faith in the army.

His soldiers and officers no longer dream of returning to the mainland through war, and they do not believe in the visionary plans that American advisers repeatedly explain to them. A friend of mine, an officer, told me in a moment of frankness that he understood his soldiers and secretly harbored the same feelings as them. The soldiers have been in the army for seven to ten years and are tired of it. They are tired of the barracks and the severe physical punishment they are prone to, and they are willing to go home and engage in peaceful labor on the mainland. My friend said: "I don't know what to do. When I have to explain to the soldiers why they should be prepared to fight China—their motherland—together with the United States, I don't know what to say. But the order requires me to 'improve' their 'morale'."

The average age of soldiers is now 30, because the army personnel have not been replaced, which also has an adverse effect on the situation in the army. It is enough to point out that Chiang Kai-shek had to retire 25,000 old and weak soldiers in September 1955. According to the official statement issued by Yan Jia-gan, chairman of Taiwan Province, 19,000 of these retired soldiers suffered from lung disease, neurasthenia, leprosy, and other diseases. Now Chiang Kai-shek is trying to get young overseas Chinese in Southeast Asian countries to replenish his army, ostensibly inviting them to study. But, so far, no one has taken the bait.

Soldiers entering concentration camps

Almost every unit in the army has large-scale disturbances, anti-military and anti-American demonstrations. Dozens of deserters are arrested every night on the west coast. As a result of frequent purges, a large number of officers and soldiers were expelled on charges of disloyalty to the Chiang Kai-shek regime, the United States, and conducting opposition demonstrations. There is no room for new prisoners in Taiwan's already overcrowded prisons, so additional concentration camps have been established, especially near Tainan and Kaohsiung, and a twenty-second special camp on an island south of Taiwan called "Black Death Camp." A large number of Chinese prisoners of war brought back from Korea were sent to this concentration camp after they refused to serve in Chiang Kai-shek's army and demanded repatriation.

American advisers acting as military police

Persecuting anti-Chiang and anti-American sentiments in the army is the main problem that plagues the "Chairman" and the Military Assistance Advisory Group. U.S. Ambassador to Taipei Rankin has recommended increasing the number of military advisers to 25,000 to 30,000 so that advisers and military police instructors can be sent to every military unit. Establishing military police control may delay the collapse of Chiang Kai-shek's army for a while, but there is no doubt that it will not increase its combat effectiveness. Many officers commented sarcastically when commenting on this measure: "It would be easier to replace our army with the American army."

Who will protect the "Chairman"?

Some American advisers have long suggested to the Chairman to replace his Chinese guards. The Americans are worried that a dagger or a pistol bullet may cause them to lose this old man (they use his name to cover up their participation in the war against Beijing). Chiang Kai-shek has not yet made up his mind on this point. However, a few people who have been to Chiang Kai-shek's residence near Taipei say that the windows of this gloomy building on a mountain are fitted with iron bars or covered with steel shutters. Among the Chinese guards, one can usually see some American military police who accompany Chiang Kai-shek between Taipei and his mountain residence on this island. Generally speaking, the "President" tries not to appear in public as much as possible, and he prefers to sit in his "armored" room behind closed shutters.

Conclusion

This is the situation in Taiwan. The residents hope to unite with the rest of China, the soldiers hope to return to their hometowns and engage in peaceful labor, and only a senile adventurer of sixty-eight years old and his American assistants continue to frantically prepare for a war that perhaps even they themselves cannot believe will be won. The "free fortress" surrounded by barbed wire is reminiscent of a concentration camp. The prisoners are all trying to escape, but not all of them succeed. However, everyone believes that freedom will come one day, and the dark and tragic days of long-suffering Taiwan will come to an end.

### 台湾内部是怎么样的情况

    台湾内部是怎么样的情况
    三月十九日“德里时代”周报刊载了题为“台湾内部是怎么样的情况？”的文章。这篇文章暴露了台湾人民反抗美蒋残暴统治和渴望重回到祖国怀抱的情况。
    据“德里时代”编辑按，这篇文章是蒋介石警察机关中的一个官员写的，“这个官员并不是一个同情共产主义的人。但是他对台湾内部的实际情况深为厌恶，而且认为蒋介石和他的朋友们已经完全失败了。”
    如果有一个旅行者到台湾去进行那怕是最短暂的旅行，他一定会首先注意到到处是禁区、铁丝网和岗哨以及在每条马路上能够看到的警车。连在最小的城镇或乡村中要想不遇上穿着美国草绿色制服的宪兵或民警巡逻队也是不容易的事。对这个岛上的居民点和马路进行这种严密的戒备究竟是为什么呢？这种周密的巡逻的目的是什么呢？
    答案是蒋介石不信任台湾人民。
    台湾现在有大约九百七十万人口。其中蒋介石的军队和他的其他部属占六十万人。其余的是在很久以前定居在这里的台湾土著和大陆上来的移民。蒋介石并不信任这些人，把他们每一个人看作是他的政权的死敌。
    台湾人反对蒋介石
    事实上，甚至在这个岛屿上寻找一个支持蒋介石的人也是很困难的。蒋介石分子和台湾人之间在这里日日夜夜地进行着公开的和地下的顽强的斗争。这场斗争，说得更确切些、这场抵抗，从蒋介石的士兵除非用武力威胁否则就不可能在村庄里得到一杯水的事实中就表现出来。这个抵抗也从经常导致真正的叛乱的那些流血冲突中表现出来。
    1955年春天，本文作者奉命对在基隆地区被杀害八名士兵和一名军官一案的审讯作证。当地居民用一枚手工做的地雷炸毁了一辆汽车并且炸死了上面的军官和士兵。在审讯的时候，被告公开说，他们憎恨建立在这个岛屿上的占领政权，并且有完全的决心要为台湾的解放和使他们居住的岛屿同整个中国重新统一而斗争。
    同蒋介石军人和美国军人发生冲突已经是非常经常的事。这是人人知道的事，虽然台湾出版的报纸从来不进行报道。例如，光在1955年上半年，约有四百五十名蒋介石和美国的官兵被杀或受伤。
    屠杀居民
    不待说，蒋介石政府采取非常严厉的措施来镇压居民的反抗事件。去年夏天我曾亲眼看到了正规部队和高雄这三个村庄居民之间的一次真正的战斗，这些人民是起义反抗台北的统治的。美国军事援助顾问团的两个军官参加了领导这次镇压这些叛众的战斗。根据他们的建议，这些村庄受到了炮击。在这些农民的房子被引着了火和这些村庄都完全燃烧后，这些叛众被迫停止了抵抗。村民被消灭到一个也不留。在处决之后接着发生了难以形容的残酷行为，一想到这些残酷行为使得我在远离台湾的现在也仍然不寒而栗。老年的男女被对准炮口击毙，就像其他亚洲国家中殖民者镇压叛变时常干的那样。许多村民被吊死在中央广场和街旁的树上。甚至现在我脑海里还常常出现一棵结着“恶果”的高大桑树的印象。根据一个军官的命令，六个人被同时吊死。我不能忍受这种可怕景象，试图反对这种暴行，但是我只落得了我们军官和美国军官的嘲笑。这个事件大概加强了我同蒋介石政权决裂的决心。
    加强了的警察和军事巡逻队现在在台湾内部监督治安，以防止再发生类似的事件。但是这并没有什么用处。战斗仍在进行。这使得委员长和他的美国顾问们非常不安。值得注意的是：蒋介石不敢用土著青年来补充他的军队。奉命参加特别劳动营的台湾青年，是只做体力劳动的。只敢给他们铲子和锄头，至于武器，就不放心给他们了。
    “委员长”在军队中失去信仰
    蒋介石在岛上人民中间没有信仰。而尤有甚者，他在军队中也正在失去信仰。
    他的士兵和军官们不再梦想借战争回到大陆去了，而且不相信美国顾问们向他们反复说明的那些空想式的计划了。我的一个朋友，一个军官，在一时的坦白心情下告诉我说，他了解他的士兵们，并且暗暗地同他们抱着同样的心情。士兵们当了七年到十年的兵已经厌倦了。他们厌倦了营房和他们容易受到的严厉体罚，他们愿意回家去在大陆上从事和平的劳动。我的朋友说：“我不知道怎样才好。在我必须向士兵们解释他们为什么应当准备同美国一起跟中国——他们的祖国——作战时，我不知道该说什么。但是命令需要我‘提高’他们的‘士气’”。
    士兵平均年龄现在是三十岁，因为军队人员没有替换，这对军队里的情况也有一种不利的影响。指出蒋介石在1955年9月不得不使二万五千名老弱士兵退休这一点就够了。根据台湾省主席严家淦所发表的官方声明，这些退伍军人中有一万九千人患着肺病、神经衰弱、麻疯病和其他疾病。现在蒋介石正在设法使住在东南亚国家的华侨青年来补充他的军队，表面上是邀请他们来读书。但是，到现在为止没有人上钩。
    进集中营的士兵
    军队中几乎每个单位都有大规模的骚动、反军事和反美的示威。西海岸每天晚上都要逮捕几十个逃兵。由于经常清洗的结果，大批官兵被以对蒋介石政权、美国不忠以及进行反对性示威的罪名而被开革。在台湾的已经有人满之患的监狱中已经没有地方容纳新犯人了，因此建立了额外的集中营，特别是在台南和高雄附近以及一个设在台湾以南的一个海岛上叫做“黑死营”的第二十二号特别营。从朝鲜带来的一大批中国战俘在他们拒绝到蒋介石的军队去服役和要求遣返后都被送到这个集中营去了。
    充当宪兵的美国顾问们
    在军队中对反蒋和反美情绪进行迫害是使“委员长”和军事援助顾问团头痛的主要问题。美国驻台北大使兰金已经建议把军事顾问增加到二万五千到三万人，以便能将顾问们和宪兵教官派到每一个军事单位去。建立宪兵控制可能使蒋介石军队的垮台拖延一个时候，但是毫无疑问，这不会增加它的战斗效力。许多军官在评论这个措施时都讽刺地指出：“用美国军队来代替我们的军队省事得多。”
      谁来保护“委员长”
    某些美国顾问们很久以来就向委员长建议更换他的中国卫队。美国人担心一把匕首或一颗手枪子弹可能使他们失去这个老头子（他们用他的名字来掩饰他们参加对北京进行的战争）。蒋介石对这一点还没有下定决心。然而，少数曾经到过台北附近蒋介石的住宅的人说，在这座位于一座山上的阴森森的建筑物的窗户都安有铁条或者是有钢做的百叶窗掩盖着，在中国卫队中间人们照例可以看到有好些美国宪兵，他们陪同蒋介石来往于台北和他在这个岛上的山地住宅之间。一般说来，“总统”设法尽量不公开露面，他宁愿坐在他的关上了百叶窗的后面的“装了甲的”房间里面。
    结论
    这就是台湾的情况。居民希望同中国其余部分统一，士兵希望回老家进行和平劳动，只有一个六十八岁的老朽的冒险家和他的美国助手们在继续狂热地准备也许他们自己都不能相信会获得胜利的战争。在用铁丝网包围起来的“自由堡垒”使人想起了集中营。囚犯们都设法逃走，但并不是全都成功的。然而，大家都相信自由终有一天会到来的，长期受苦难的台湾的阴暗悲惨的日子是会结束的。
