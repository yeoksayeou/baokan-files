Problems to be Solved in Mechanical Industry Production
    Jiang Yiwei
    After the Party Central Committee's call for developing industry in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way was conveyed within the mechanical industry system, the production enthusiasm of the workers and masses soared to unprecedented heights. The total production value target issued by the First Ministry of Machine Building for this year has already been raised by 28% compared to the original national plan target, and after discussions among the masses in enterprises, it has been further surpassed. According to preliminary statistics from some enterprises, the targets after discussion have been raised by an average of more than 20% compared to the targets issued by the ministry.

    In this situation, a series of complex new problems have emerged in enterprises, requiring leaders to solve them in a timely manner. For example: First, how to determine production tasks? How much to increase production? Which products can be increased, and which cannot? Second, the balance established on the basis of the old plan has been broken, and a new balance must be established in terms of materials, equipment, collaboration, labor, etc., on the basis of increased production. Third, with heavier tasks and more strained relationships between various links in production, the original technical and organizational level of the enterprise is completely unable to adapt. What should be done? These three problems are all urgent problems to be solved at present. Only by solving these problems can the production upsurge that is forming be consolidated and continue to develop.

    The products of the mechanical industry are mostly technical equipment needed by various economic sectors. These products must be produced according to the specific needs of various departments. With the accelerated construction in various economic sectors, the demand for equipment has naturally increased greatly. However, merely having a demand cannot specifically define the increased production tasks of the mechanical industry. It is necessary to specifically grasp what varieties and specifications are needed by various departments in order to determine which products can be increased and by how much, and which products cannot be increased, and even individual products may need to be reduced due to changes in demand.

    Increasing production requires a corresponding increase in the supply of materials, mainly steel. Although steel production has also increased significantly, with accelerated construction across the country, the demand for steel has also generally increased. In a situation where steel production cannot fully meet the needs, the state must allocate it according to the priority of needs, and the steel needed for certain products of the mechanical industry may not be fully supplied. At the same time, some steel currently still relies on imports, making it even more difficult to suddenly increase demand.

    Therefore, determining the increased production tasks of the mechanical industry must combine production, supply, and sales considerations. Otherwise, it will inevitably lead to a serious disconnect between production, supply, and sales, which would be detrimental to the country.

    Based on the above situation, the First Ministry of Machine Building has established three principles for increasing production:

    First, products that are in short supply and needed for national key construction projects, such as machine tools, drilling rigs, bridge cranes, power station equipment, etc., should be increased as much as possible, and the supply of materials and collaborative parts should be prioritized for these products.

    Second, products that are needed by the state and for which materials and collaboration are guaranteed can also be increased as much as possible.

    Third, products for which demand and materials are limited can only be increased moderately or not at all.

    According to these three principles, enterprise leaders must guide the enthusiasm of the masses towards increasing new varieties, improving product quality, and reducing product costs, based on the specific situation, in order to implement the central government's policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical" and seeking "more, faster" on the basis of "better, more economical."

    After the increase in production tasks and the significant improvement in labor productivity, the materials prepared according to the original plan are insufficient. In the past, when material resources were abundant, if there was a shortage of materials, one could apply to the production department at any time. Now, with more departments needing materials, it is difficult to apply for supply. In the past, the supply of materials to various factories was not tight, and mutual adjustment was easy. Now, the possibility of mutual adjustment is also reduced.

    When tasks are not tight, organizing collaboration is relatively easy. After the increase in tasks, on the one hand, there are more requests for collaboration, and on the other hand, the ability to undertake collaboration is reduced. Coupled with the fact that organizational work cannot keep up for a while, it is not only difficult to find units to undertake new collaboration tasks, but even existing collaborative relationships are difficult to maintain.

    Within each enterprise, new imbalances have also emerged in terms of production area, equipment, labor, etc., requiring necessary adjustments and supplements.

    These problems are very practical, and failure to solve them in a timely manner will immediately hinder the development of the production upsurge that is forming. In January and February, many enterprises, such as Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Plant and Wuxi Diesel Engine Plant, experienced a situation where workers were greatly exceeding quotas on the one hand, and waiting for materials, tools, and collaborative parts on the other hand. As a result, they were unable to complete the national plan or increased production targets.

    It should be said that many of the above problems cannot be completely solved solely by the subjective efforts of the enterprises themselves. The supply of materials, the arrangement of collaboration, the necessary equipment supplementation, and the allocation of labor all require the necessary support and solutions from the leadership departments of the ministry, the administrative bureau, and the local party committee and government. However, enterprises themselves must also make a series of efforts to fully tap the potential of human resources, equipment, materials, and other aspects. Leadership departments and enterprises should also resolutely correct the tendency of departmentalism and strengthen collaboration and mutual support between enterprises to eliminate artificial tensions. Taking the supply of materials as an example, after the tasks became tight, enterprises generally tended to prefer more rather than less. They wanted to request more of what was lacking, and were unwilling to transfer out what was surplus, which increased the difficulty of overall material supply and adjustment. At present, because the material reserve quota still lacks scientific calculation, the phenomenon of excessive reserve of some materials still exists. There is also great potential in terms of material consumption. Therefore, in addition to striving for more material resources to meet the needs of increased production tasks, enterprises should also tap the internal resource potential of raw materials through clearing inventory, strengthening adjustment, compressing reserve and consumption quotas, carrying out mass movements to save raw materials, and strengthening metal recovery and waste utilization.

    When tasks are not tight and quotas are relatively loose, there is surplus equipment capacity, large reserves of materials and semi-finished products, poor production preparation, late arrival of drawings, tools, materials, etc., and poor coordination between various processes. It is still possible to barely complete the task. If equipment is damaged and repairs are not timely, one can wait. If the precision of the equipment is insufficient or the quality of the tools is not good, one can spend more working hours to make the parts meet the standards. If the quality of parts is poor and unqualified, there is surplus working time, and rework is not difficult. Now all of this is no longer possible, and has become a prominent problem hindering the completion of tasks. In particular, after a large number of rationalization proposals are put forward, they require timely review and processing, require the manufacture of more tools, and require the timely revision of outdated process methods. The promotion of various advanced experiences also requires organizational and technical work to keep up accordingly. At present, in many enterprises, in the promotion of high-speed cutting, a large number of cemented carbide tools are damaged due to workers' poor use of tools. As a result, on the one hand, production is increased, and on the other hand, costs are greatly increased. Some enterprises do not organize forces to concentrate on sharpening tools, but require workers to sharpen them themselves, wasting a lot of working hours, thereby reducing the effect of high-speed cutting. All of this shows that in order to consolidate and continue to develop the production upsurge that is forming, it is not enough to rely solely on the enthusiasm of the workers and masses without timely improving the technical level and management level of the enterprise. However, at present, most enterprises are still taking some temporary measures to cope with these problems, and have not regarded improving enterprise management and technical level as the fundamental problem of consolidating and further leading current production.

    Based on the above situation, the First Ministry of Machine Building is formulating an outline of the enterprise transformation plan for 1956-1957, requiring existing enterprises to comprehensively improve the planning, organization, technology, economy, and other aspects of their work within two years, with technical transformation as the center. After Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant and Chongqing Machine Tool Plant carried out systematic transformation, their output and quality rapidly improved. Therefore, after determining the production tasks and increased production targets, each enterprise must guide the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers to the track of fighting for the realization of the comprehensive transformation of the enterprise.

    机械工业生产需要解决的问题
    蒋一苇
    党中央关于又多、又快、又好、又省地发展工业的号召，在机械工业系统中传达以后，职工群众的生产热情空前高涨。第一机械工业部今年下达的全年生产总值指标，已经较国家计划原定的指标提高了28％，经过企业中群众讨论后又被突破。根据部分企业的初步统计，讨论后的指标比部下达的指标平均又提高了20％以上。
      在这种情况下，企业里出现了一系列的复杂的新问题，要求领导及时解决。例如：第一，生产任务如何确定？增产多少？哪些产品可以增产？哪些不能增产？第二，建立在旧计划基础上的平衡被打破了，必须在增产的基础上，重新建立材料、设备、协作、劳动力等各方面的平衡；第三，任务加重了，生产中各个环节之间的关系更紧张，企业原有的技术和组织水平完全不能适应了，怎么办？这三个问题都是当前迫切要解决的问题。只有解决了这些问题，才能使正在形成中的生产高潮巩固和继续发展下去。
    机械工业的产品，绝大部分是各经济部门所需要的技术装备。这些产品必须根据各部门的具体需要来生产。各经济部门的建设都加快了，对设备的需要量自然也大大增加了。但是，仅仅一个需要量还不能具体规定机械工业的增产任务，一定要具体掌握各部门需要的是些什么品种、规格，才能确定哪些产品能增产和增多少，哪些产品不能增产，甚至个别产品因为需要的变动还要减产。
    产量增加了就需要相应地增加材料的供应，主要是钢铁的供应。钢铁的产量虽然也大大增长了，但是，全国许多建设都加快进行，对钢铁的需要量也普遍增加。在钢铁生产不能完全满足需要的情况下，国家必须按照需要的轻重缓急进行分配，机械工业的某些产品所需要的钢材就不可能得到充分供应。同时，一部分钢材目前还要靠国外进口，突然要求增加更有困难。
    因此，确定机械工业的增产任务，必须把产供销三方面结合起来考虑，否则，就必然造成产供销的严重脱节。这对国家反而不利。
    根据以上情况，第一机械工业部确定了三条增产原则：
    第一，凡是供不应求，又是国家重点建设所需要的产品，如机床、钻探机、桥式起重机、电站设备等，应当尽量增产，并且在材料和协作件的供应方面，首先满足这类产品的要求。
    第二，国家有需要，材料、协作等也有保证的产品，也可以尽量增产。
    第三，需要和材料都有限的产品，只能适度增产，或不增产。
    根据这三个原则，企业领导人员必须根据具体情况，把群众的积极性引向增加新品种、改善产品质量、降低产品成本等方面去，以贯彻执行中央提出的“多、快、好、省”和在“好、省”基础上求“多、快”的方针。
    生产任务增加和劳动生产率大大提高以后，按原计划准备的材料不够了。过去材料资源富裕的时候，如果材料不足，可以随时向生产部门申请，现在要材料的部门增多了，申请供应就困难了；过去各厂材料的供应不紧张，互相调剂也容易，现在互相调剂的可能性也少了。
    任务不紧的时候，组织协作比较容易。任务增加以后，一方面要求协作的多了，另一方面承接协作的能力则减少了，加上组织工作一时跟不上，所以，不但新的协作任务不容易找到承接的单位，连原有的协作关系也难以维持了。
    在每个企业里，生产面积、设备、劳动力等各方面也出现新的不平衡，需要进行必要的调整和补充。
    这些问题都是很实际的，不及时解决立刻就会阻碍正在形成中的生产高潮的发展。一、二月份就有不少企业，如沈阳第三机床厂、无锡柴油机厂等，一方面工人大量突破定额，一方面停工待料、待工具、待协作件等。结果不能完成国家计划或增产指标。
    应当说，以上这些问题，有许多光靠企业本身的主观努力，是不能完全解决的，如材料的供应、协作的安排、必要的设备补充、劳动力的调配等，都需要部、管理局以及地方党委、政府领导部门给以必要的支持和解决。但是，在企业本身还必须作一系列的努力，充分发掘人力、设备、材料等各方面的潜力。领导部门和企业还应当坚决纠正本位主义的倾向，加强企业间的协作和互相支援，以消除人为的紧张因素。拿材料的供应来说吧，任务紧张以后各企业普遍有宁多勿少的倾向。缺少的要多要，多余的也不愿调出，这就增加了整个材料供应和调剂的困难。现在，因为材料储备定额还缺乏科学的核算，部分材料储备过多的现象仍然存在。材料消耗方面的潜力也是很大的。因此，除了争取更多的材料资源来满足增产任务的需要以外，各企业还应当通过清理库存、加强调剂、压缩储备和消耗定额，开展群众性的节约原材料运动，以及加强金属回收和废料利用等工作，挖掘原材料的内部资源潜力。
    在任务不紧，定额较松的情况下，设备能力有余，材料和半成品储备量大，生产准备工作差一点，图纸、工具、材料等迟到一点，各工序间配合得不好，也还可以勉强完成任务。设备坏了，检修不及时，可以等一等。设备的精度不够或者工具的质量不好，可以多花些工时使零件达到标准。零件质量差，不合格，工台时有富余，返修也不困难。现在这一切都不行了，都成为阻碍任务完成的突出问题了。特别是合理化建议大量提出以后，要求及时审查处理，要求制造更多的工具，要求及时修订落后的工艺方法。各种先进经验的推广，也要求组织工作和技术工作相应跟上去。目前不少企业在推广高速切削中，因工人不善使用刀具，硬质合金刀具大量损坏，结果是一方面增产，一方面成本大大提高。有的企业没有组织力量集中磨刀，要工人自己磨，浪费很多工时，因而减少了高速切削的效果。这些，都说明要把正在形成中的生产高潮巩固下来和继续发展下去，光靠职工群众的积极性，而不及时提高企业的技术水平和管理水平是不行的。但是，目前各企业多半还在采取一些临时措施来应付这些问题，没有把改善企业的管理和提高技术水平，看做是巩固和进一步领导当前生产的根本问题。
    根据以上情况，第一机械工业部正在拟订1956—1957年企业改造规划纲要，要求现有企业在两年内以技术改造为中心，全面改善企业的计划、组织、技术、经济等各方面的工作。沈阳第二机床厂和重庆机床厂进行了系统的改造以后，产量、质量就迅速提高。因此，各个企业在确定了生产任务和增产指标以后，必须把广大职工群众的积极性引导到为实现企业的全面改造而斗争的轨道上去。
