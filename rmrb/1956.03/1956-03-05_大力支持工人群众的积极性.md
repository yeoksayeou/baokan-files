To complete the nation's first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and above quota, we must give full play to the initiative of the worker masses. However, in the past, the Yumen Oil Mine had some right-leaning conservative ideas in this regard, and the importance and support for the initiative of the worker masses were insufficient. For example, there were countless rules and regulations regarding the rationalization proposals of the worker masses: If the leadership has considered the issue, the workers' proposal does not count as a suggestion; a proposal not submitted in the rationalization proposal form does not count as a suggestion; a proposal submitted in the rationalization proposal form but implemented without approval does not count as a suggestion; a proposal related to one's duties but possessing originality does not count as a suggestion; a proposal unrelated to one's duties but submitted by a technician also does not count as a suggestion. Proposals that are not perfect enough are not adopted; proposals that are costly to implement are not adopted; proposals that the reviewers do not understand are not adopted; proposals that are similar in nature to newly added equipment are not adopted. Even if some rationalization proposals are adopted, sometimes they are not rewarded according to the state's reward policy, advocating "reward as little as possible, not reward if possible." The same goes for the advanced initiatives and advanced experiences of the worker masses; there are endless worries, either not supporting them or not supporting them vigorously. For example, in 1955, some capital construction units established youth shock brigades, which played a significant role in promoting the completion of the national plan. This advanced experience should have been promoted! However, some shifts in the mechanical installation engineering team already had the conditions to establish youth shock brigades, and the youth of this team repeatedly applied, but the leadership never approved it. The truck drivers of the Transportation Department proposed the initiative of "safe driving of 100,000 kilometers, no major repairs in 100,000 kilometers." This is a very good initiative, and all truck drivers should be mobilized to participate in this safe driving movement through this initiative, but the leadership hesitated and did not dare to promote it boldly. The Tian Wenkuan drilling team's average monthly drilling speed reached 597 meters in 1955, exceeding the national plan target by 93.4%, and they drilled 9 wells throughout the year without a single drilling stuck accident. Such valuable experience should have been valued and promoted, but no one paid attention to it, let alone promoted it.

In order to change this situation, since November of last year, the Yumen Oil Mine Party organization has exposed and criticized various right-leaning conservative ideas regarding the initiative of the worker masses from top to bottom, actively supporting the rationalization proposals of the worker masses and promoting the advanced experience of the worker masses. The oil mine party organization specifically studied the existing advanced experience of each unit, pointed out which ones needed to be vigorously promoted, which ones needed further research and summary, and which ones still needed to be cultivated, and promoted the advanced experience of the oil production plant regarding preventing paraffin accumulation in 92% of the wells in the entire mine. Because the Party organization seriously criticized right-leaning conservative ideas and resolutely supported the rationalization proposals of the worker masses and the promotion of advanced experience, the initiative of the worker masses was fully developed, and new developments quickly emerged in production. For example, the Petroleum Exploration Conference held at the end of last year greatly increased this year's national plan targets due to the implementation of the spirit of opposing conservatism, tapping potential, and promoting advanced experience. For example, crude oil production was increased by tens of thousands of tons, drilling footage was increased by 23%, and geological exploration workload was increased by more than 20%. After the meeting, because the plan was handed over to the masses for discussion and the masses were further mobilized, even more advanced plans were put forward. For example, many drilling teams guaranteed that the average monthly speed of the drilling rig would be increased by another 40%. As another example, the 1004 team of the drilling department originally had a national task of drilling 3,600 meters. After studying this, the team proposed an advanced plan to drill 6,120 meters throughout the year, saving 250,000 yuan and training 34 technicians. Later, the party committee secretary of the department went deep into the 1004 team to conduct inspections and found that there was still potential for increased production among the masses, and the targets set by the team were not very advanced. He further mobilized the workers to discuss the plan, and the final plan put forward was: drill 7,200 meters throughout the year, save 400,000 yuan, and train 48 technicians. The 3206 drilling team created a new national record of 462.3 meters per day on January 4th this year and proposed to increase the daily footage record to 500 meters this year; by January 12th, the team had completed the drilling task for January 19 days ahead of schedule. The Wang Dengxue drilling team put forward the initiative to drill 6,000 meters throughout the year, which has been widely responded to by drilling workers, and some have guaranteed to exceed 6,000 meters. Since the Zhang Huiwu youth lathe team put forward the guarantee of "no material requisition for three days a day" on November 25th last year, in the 240 working days up to January 12th this year, there were 102 working days where no material requisition was made. The first brigade of the transportation department launched a no-oil consumption movement of 500 kilometers per month in December last year, and now 142 vehicles have achieved 789 kilometers per month without oil consumption.

These facts fully prove that the vast worker masses have great initiative. As long as we are good at inspiring the initiative of the worker masses, vigorously support, adopt, and promote the rationalization proposals, advanced experience, and advanced initiatives of the worker masses, we will obtain endless power to complete the national plan ahead of schedule and above quota.

### 大力支持工人群众的积极性

    大力支持工人群众的积极性
    中共玉门油矿委员会宣传部副部长  张洪
    要提前和超额完成国家的第一个五年计划，就必须充分发挥工人群众的积极性。而玉门油矿过去在这一方面却存在着一些右倾保守思想，对工人群众的积极性的重视和支持是不够的。比如对待工人群众的合理化建议就有数不尽的清规和戒律：领导上考虑过的问题工人提出来不算建议，不填合理化建议书的不算建议，填了合理化建议书未经批准就做出来的不算建议，与职责有关虽具有独创性的建议不算建议，与职责无关而是技术人员提出来的也不算建议。建议提得不够完善的不采纳，建议的实现费事大的不采纳，审查人员不懂的建议不采纳，和新添设备性质相同的建议不采纳。有的合理化建议即使被采纳了，有时也不按照国家的奖励政策进行奖励，主张“能少奖就少奖，能不奖就不奖”。对工人群众的先进倡议和先进经验，同样抱着无穷的忧虑，不是不予支持，就是不予大力支持。比如1955年有些基本建设单位建立了青年突击队以后，对于推动国家计划的完成起了不小作用。这条先进经验总该推广了吧！可是机械安装工程队的有些班已经具备了建立青年突击队的条件，而且这个队的青年一再申请，领导上却一直不予批准。运输处的汽车司机们提出了“安全行车十万公里，十万公里不大修”的倡议，这是一个很好的倡议，应该通过这个倡议去发动所有汽车司机参加这个安全行车的运动，可是领导上却瞻前顾后，不敢大胆提倡。田文宽钻井队1955年的钻机月速度平均达到597公尺、超过国家计划指标的93.4％，而且全年钻了9口井，没有出一次钻卡事故。这样宝贵的经验理应得到重视和推广，可是却无人过问，更不要说推广了。
    为了改变这种状况，玉门油矿党组织从去年11月以来，由上而下地揭发和批判了对待工人群众积极性的各种右倾保守思想，积极支持工人群众的合理化建议和推广工人群众的先进经验。油矿党组织具体研究了各单位现有的先进经验，指出哪些需要大力推广，哪些需要进一步研究和总结，哪些还需要继续加以培植，并将采油厂关于通腊不喷腊的先进经验，在全矿92％的井上加以推广。由于党组织严肃地批判了右倾保守思想，坚决支持工人群众的合理化建议和先进经验的推广，工人群众的积极性就得到了充分的发挥，生产上也就迅速出现了新的气象。比如去年年底举行的石油勘探会议，由于贯彻了反保守、挖潜力和推广先进经验的精神，就大大提高了今年的国家计划指标，像原油产量就提高了若干万吨，钻井进尺提高了23％，地质勘查工作量提高了20％以上。会议之后，由于把计划交给群众讨论并进一步发动了群众，又提出了更加先进的计划。如许多钻井队保证钻机的平均月速度再提高40％。再如，钻井处的一零零四队，原来国家给的任务是钻进3，600公尺，这个队经过研究以后，提出全年钻进6，120公尺，节约25万元并培养34名技术工人的先进计划。后来，处的党委书记深入一零零四队进行检查，发现群众中还有增产的潜力，队里订的指标并不是很先进的，就进一步发动工人讨论计划，最后提出的计划是：全年钻进7，200公尺，节约40万元，培养48名技术工人。三二零六钻井队今年1月4日创造了日进尺462.3公尺的全国新纪录，并倡议在今年内把日进尺纪录提高到500公尺；到1月12日，这个队已提前19天完成了1月份的钻井任务。王登学钻井队提出全年钻进6，000公尺的倡议，已经得到钻井工人的普遍响应，有的并保证超过6，000公尺。张慧悟青年车工班自去年11月25日提出了“三天一日不领料”的保证后，到今年1月12日的240个工作日中，就有102个工作日做到不领料。运输处第一大队在去年12月份发动了每月500公里的不领油运动，现在已经有142部汽车做到了每月789公里不领油。
    这些事实充分证明，广大工人群众中蕴藏着极大的积极性，只要我们善于启发工人群众的积极性，大力支持、采纳和推广工人群众的合理化建议、先进经验和先进倡议，我们就会取得提前和超额完成国家计划的无穷无尽的力量。
