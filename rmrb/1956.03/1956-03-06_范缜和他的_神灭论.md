    Fan Zhen and His "On the Extinction of the Soul"
    Fan Ruoyu
    During the Northern and Southern Dynasties in China, a time when Buddhism was flourishing, a remarkable atheist, Fan Zhen (450 – ?), emerged. His essay "On the Extinction of the Soul," written in 507 AD, still shines with the light of wisdom. In "On the Extinction of the Soul," one can see that the highest question in philosophy—the relationship between matter and spirit—was already expressed so clearly in Fan Zhen's wisdom 1450 years ago that it still feels valuable to readers today.
    The rulers of the time chose Buddhism to deceive the people, hoping to use it to consolidate their rule. For example, Xiao Yan (Emperor Wu of Liang) "abandoned heterodox paths to serve the Tathagata" in his capacity as emperor, and explicitly announced, "Only the Buddhist path is the correct path," calling on princes, nobles, officials, and all others to serve Buddhism together. During the period when he revered Buddhism as the state religion, there were more than 500 Buddhist temples and over 100,000 monks and nuns in the Liang capital alone. These temples possessed vast amounts of property and extensively exploited the people. It is said that the form of usurious exploitation that later became the pawnshop industry also began in the Buddhist temples of the Southern Dynasties. It was in this situation that Fan Zhen fiercely attacked Buddhism. This was a famous debate in the history of Chinese philosophy between theism and atheism.
    When Fan Zhen was an official in the Qi dynasty, he had a debate with Prince Zi Liang of Jingling about the "theory of karma." The Book of Liang records it this way:
    "Initially, when Zhen was serving Prince Zi Liang of Jingling in the Qi dynasty, Zi Liang, deeply faithful in Buddhism, while Zhen strongly asserted there was no Buddha. Zi Liang asked: 'If you do not believe in karma, how can there be wealth and nobility in the world? How can there be poverty and lowliness?' Zhen replied: 'A person's life is like a flower on a tree, sprouting from the same branch, blooming from the same stem, falling as the wind blows. Some are swept onto the fine mats inside the curtains, while others fall beside fences and walls into the filth of latrines. Those who fall onto the mats, that is Your Highness; those who fall into the latrines, that is your humble servant. Though nobility and lowliness follow different paths, where does the karma lie?' Zi Liang could not refute him and found him deeply strange."
    Buddhism believes that after a person's physical body dies, the soul remains immortal. In Buddhism's view, the soul is like a traveler lodging in a person's body; when one body dies, the soul moves into another newborn body. Moreover, the soul's actions in its "previous life" determine what kind of body it will inhabit in its "present life." That is, if the soul did "good deeds" in its "previous life," it can live in the body of a wealthy person in its "present life"; if it did "bad deeds" in its "previous life," it must live in the body of a "poor and lowly" person in its "present life." Similarly, the soul's actions in its "present life" will determine what kind of body it will inhabit in its "future life." Buddhism uses the phenomena of wealth, nobility, poverty, and lowliness in class society to fabricate this so-called "cycle of birth and death" and "retribution for good and evil" "theory of karma." Fan Zhen, however, believed that all human life, like the blooming of trees, is a natural phenomenon; it is not that there is a good or bad soul "reincarnating" before birth. As for the phenomena of wealth, nobility, poverty, and lowliness in the human world, these are merely different experiences after a person is born, and it is impossible to use these phenomena as the basis for the "theory of karma." He indignantly questioned the Buddhists: Although people and their social status are not the same, where exactly is the "karma"?
    Because of his adherence to atheism, he never got along with those in power within the ruling class. The History of the Southern Dynasties and the Book of Liang both say that he was "upright in nature, fond of lofty and dangerous words, and not favored by his fellow officials." When he served in Xiao Yan's court, he was "always dissatisfied because his aspirations were not fulfilled." When Buddhists could not theoretically defeat him, they tried to lure and threaten him politically, but this staunch atheist warrior was not someone who could be "seduced by wealth or subdued by force." The History of the Southern Dynasties says:
    "When this theory came out, the court and the public were in an uproar. Zi Liang gathered monks to challenge him, but they could not refute him... Zi Liang sent Wang Rong to tell him: 'The extinction of the soul is unreasonable, yet you stubbornly insist on it, I fear it will damage the prestige of the teachings! With your great talents, why worry about not reaching the position of Middle Secretariat? Why deliberately be so contrary and cause trouble? You should abandon it immediately!' Zhen laughed loudly and said: 'If Fan Zhen were to sell his theory to get an official position, he would have become your servant already, let alone just a Middle Secretariat!'"
    In addition, he endured ridicule and abuse, but he fought steadfastly. A man named Wang Yan wrote an article scolding him: "Alas, Fan Zi! Does he not know where the spirits of his ancestors reside!" thinking that this would prevent Fan Zhen from insisting on atheism. However, Fan Zhen retorted sharply: "Alas, Prince Wang! Knows where the spirits of his ancestors reside, yet cannot kill himself to follow them!" This silenced the theist. When his On the Extinction of the Soul was published, it was precisely when Xiao Yan had officially declared Buddhism to be the orthodox thought, and he himself had only recently been re-employed after being demoted. However, he completely disregarded his personal gains and losses and resolutely launched a merciless attack on Buddhism.
    Fan Zhen's "On the Extinction of the Soul" is written in the form of questions and answers. He presented various accusations made by Buddhists against atheism as questions, and through answering these questions, he systematically elaborated on his own atheistic thoughts.
    At the beginning of "On the Extinction of the Soul," Fan Zhen wrote: "The spirit is the form, and the form is the spirit. Therefore, when the form exists, the spirit exists; when the form ceases, the spirit perishes." Because Buddhism believes that a person's soul and body are two separate things, and that the soul remains immortal after the body dies, Fan Zhen believed that a person's spirit and body are a unified whole that are interconnected. After the body dies, the spirit also perishes with it.
    Fan Zhen not only believed that matter and spirit are interconnected but also believed that this connection is a subordinate relationship. He clearly pointed out: "The form is the substance of the spirit, and the spirit is the function of the form." That is to say, matter is the substance that produces spirit, and spirit is the function produced by matter. Clearly, he believed that matter is fundamental and that the function of matter is derivative, that is, matter is primary, and spirit is secondary.
    Fan Zhen believed that different forms of matter produce different functions. He said: "The substance of man has knowledge, and the substance of wood has no knowledge." That is to say, as the material form of man, it has the function of "having knowledge," while the material form of a tree does not have the function of "having knowledge." He affirmed that man is matter and that spirit is the product of man's material form. Therefore, he pointed out that one cannot prove that there is a spirit that can exist independently of matter simply because man has knowledge and wood does not.
    Fan Zhen believed that matter is not static but is in motion and changing. He pointed out that whenever something changes into something else due to motion, the original function of that thing also changes with the change of the thing. He said: "The form of the living is not the form of the dead, and the form of the dead is not the form of the living; the distinction is already clear." That is to say, changing from a living person to a dead person is a qualitative change from one material form to another. Because there is a qualitative change, the "having knowledge" function of the living person also changes to being unknowing when they become dead. In this way, he further explained his point that "when the form exists, the spirit exists; when the form ceases, the spirit perishes."
    Fan Zhen believed that human nerve function is a product of human physiological organs, and that human physiological activity is the basis of human psychological activity. He said, "Hands and feet have the sense of pain," and "The five organs each have their own function," and so on. Although, due to the limitations of scientific knowledge at the time, he mistakenly believed that "considerations of right and wrong are governed by the heart," mistaking a blood circulatory organ for a thinking organ, this was still an unavoidable error at the time. It does not affect his correctness on the highest philosophical questions. As a specific question of what is the organ of thought, he was wrong; but as the principle that thought must be the product of the thinking organ, that is, that spirit must be the product of matter, he was right.
    Fan Zhen's mistake lies in completely attributing human thought to human physiological processes. For example, he believed that "the body of a sage" determines "the spirit of a sage," and that "the ordinary person's organs" determine "the ordinary person's spirit." He did not understand that although a person's ability to think is a product of their thinking organs, the degree of development and content of their thinking are determined by the social conditions from which people cannot be separated. Because he did not understand this, he made the same conclusion as the idealists, based on the mechanistic view that physiological organs determine everything about a person, believing that sages are born with sage bodies, and ordinary people are born with ordinary organs, completely ignoring the influence of social conditions on people. In addition, when Buddhists used ghost stories from Confucian classics to debate with him, he was finally forced to acknowledge a kind of ghost that seemed unrelated to the human world, under the condition that he did not recognize "people becoming ghosts after death." He said: "There are people, and there are ghosts, a distinction between the visible and invisible." Therefore, like all atheists before Marxism, he was not and could not be a thorough, scientific atheist.
    At the end of "On the Extinction of the Soul," Fan Zhen pointed out the political purpose of his work. He criticized the various evils that had arisen due to the popularity of Buddhism at the time, namely the adverse effects on customs, population, production, military affairs, administration, finance, and so on, and then elaborated on his own political thoughts. His political propositions, such as "the common people are content with their fields" and "the lower levels have surplus to support their superiors," were nothing more than wanting the peasants to cultivate the land well and support the landlords. He wanted to use his philosophical theory to explain his political propositions. He not only did not conceal this, but also openly stated that he was using his philosophical theory as a weapon in the political struggle, "using this path."
    After the "On the Extinction of the Soul," which shocked the court and the public, was published, Emperor Xiao Yan and the Great Sangha Chief Shi Fayun mobilized more than 60 monks and lay "celebrities" to write more than 70 articles to refute Fan Zhen. In these refutations, in addition to accusing Fan Zhen of "violating the scriptures," "being irrational," "destroying the sages," and "turning his back on the teaching," they listed ghost stories from books to prove the existence of ghosts and spirits. No one was able to refute Fan Zhen's basic ideas in "On the Extinction of the Soul." Later, Fan Zhen wrote "Reply to Cao Sheren" as a representative reply. Fan Zhen "claimed that his arguments could defeat the multitude, converting a thousand people a day," and even his opponents could not help but "admire Zhen's simplicity and precision."
    Fan Zhen's "On the Extinction of the Soul" has lasted for 1450 years. Even if there are some mistakes in it, if we look at Fan Zhen historically, people will feel that under the conditions at the time, it was rare for him to be able to observe the relationship between matter and spirit to such a correct degree. He is one of the great thinkers in Chinese history, and his materialist thought is one of the historical legacies that we should critically inherit.

    范缜和他的“神灭论”
    范若愚
    在我国的南北朝时期，正当佛教盛行的时候，却出现了一位杰出的无神论者范缜（450——？）。他在公元507年写的“神灭论”一文，至今还闪耀着智慧的光芒。人们在“神灭论”一文中可以看到：后来被总结为哲学上的最高问题、即物质与精神的关系问题，在1450年前范缜的智慧中已表现的那样明显，以至使现在的人读了依然觉得可贵。
    当时的统治者选定了佛教来愚弄人民，想利用佛教来巩固自己的统治。如萧衍（梁武帝）曾以皇帝的身份“舍外道以事如来”，并且明令宣布 “唯佛一道是为正道”，号召王侯宗室、公卿百官一体事佛。当他奉佛教为国教的时期，只梁京城之内，就有佛寺五百多所，僧尼十万多人。这些佛寺都拥有大量财产，对人民的剥削范围甚广，据说后来成为典当业的那种高利贷剥削形式，也是从南朝的佛寺开始的。范缜就在这种情形下猛烈地对佛教进行了攻击。这是中国哲学史上有神论与无神论的一次有名的论争。
    范缜还在齐做官的时候，就曾和竟陵王子良有过一次关于“因果论”的论争，梁书中这样记载着：
    “初，缜在齐世，尝侍竟陵王子良，子良精信释教，而缜盛称无佛。子良问曰：‘君不信因果，世间何得有富贵？何得有贫贱？’缜答曰：‘人之生，譬如一树花，同发一枝，俱开一蒂，随风而堕，自有拂帘晃坠于茵席之上，自有关篱墙落于粪溷之侧。坠茵席者，殿下是也；落粪溷者，下官是也。贵贱虽复殊途，因果竟在何处？’子良不能屈，深怪之。”
    佛教认为人的肉体死亡之后，灵魂依然不灭。在佛教看来，灵魂好像一个旅客一样寄住在人的肉体之内，当一个肉体死亡之后，灵魂就又搬到另一个新生的肉体之内去住；而且灵魂在“前世”的所作所为，决定它“今世”要住在一个什么人的肉体之内。就是说，如果灵魂在“前世”做了“好事”，“今世”就可住在富贵人的肉体之内；如果“前世”做了“坏事”，“今世”就要住在一个“贫贱”人的肉体之内。同样，灵魂在“今世”的所作所为，也要决定它在“来世”要住在一个什么人的肉体之内。佛教利用阶级社会里的富贵贫贱现象，臆造出了这种所谓“生死轮回”、“善恶报应”的“因果论”来。范缜却认为一切人的生命，像树木开花一样，是自然的现象，不是在生前就有一个或好或坏的灵魂“投胎”“转生”的，至于人间的富贵贫贱现象，只是人在出生以后的不同遭遇而已，绝不能把人间富贵贫贱的现象作为“因果报应”论据。他不胜愤慨地质问佛教徒说：人与人间贵贱虽然不相同，但“因果”究竟在何处呢？
    由于他对无神论的坚持，他一生和统治阶级中的当权者气味不能相投。南史和梁书都说他“性质直，好高危言论，不为士友所安。”他在萧衍朝中为官时，“因所怀未满，亦常怏怏”。当佛教徒不能在理论上折服他的时候，也曾从政治上利诱过他、威胁过他，可是这位坚定的无神论的战士，是“富贵不能淫，威武不能屈”的。南史说：
    “此论出，朝野喧哗，子良集僧难之，而不能屈。……子良使王融谓之曰：‘神灭既自非理，而卿坚执之，恐伤名教！以卿之大美，何患不至中书郎，而故乖刺为此，可便毁弃之！’缜大笑曰：‘使范缜卖论取官，已至令仆矣，何但中书郎耶？’”
    此外，他也曾受尽了讽刺和谩骂，但他坚定不移地战斗着，有个叫做王琰的人，写文章骂他说：“呜呼范子！曾不知其先祖神灵所在！”以为这样就可以使范缜不敢坚持无神论了，可是，范缜却针锋相对地回答说：“呜呼王子！知其先祖神灵所在而不能杀身以从之！”这样，倒使得这位有神论者再说不出话来了。当他的神灭论发表的时候，正是在萧衍正式宣布了佛教为正统思想，而他本人则是在被谪后又被起用的不久，可是，他完全没有顾虑个人的得失，毅然决然地向佛教进行了无情的攻击。
    范缜的“神灭论”是用问答体写的。他把佛教徒对于无神论的种种责难设为问题，通过对于这些问题的答辩形式，有系统地阐述了他自己的无神论的思想。
    在“神灭论”的开头，范缜写道：“神即形也，形即神也，是以形存则神存，形谢则神灭也。”因为佛教认为人的灵魂和肉体是可以分离的两种东西，肉体死亡，灵魂依然不灭。范缜则认为人的精神和肉体是互相结合着的统一体，肉体死亡之后，精神也就随之而灭。
    范缜不仅认为物质和精神是相互结合的，而且认为这种结合的关系是从属的关系。他明白地指出：“形者，神之质，神者，形之用”，这就是说，物质是产生精神的本体，精神是物质所产生的作用。很明显地，他认为物质是根本的，物质的作用是派生的，也就是说，物质是第一性的，精神是第二性的。
    范缜认为物质的不同形态产生着不同的作用，他说：“人之质，质有知也，木之质，质无知也”，这就是说，作为人的这一物质形态，就具有“有知”的作用，作为树木的这一物质形态，就没有“有知”作用。他肯定了人是物质，而精神是作为人的这一物质形态的产物。因而也就指出不能因为人有知而木无知，就证明世界上有什么能够离开物质而独立存在的神。
    范缜认为物质不是静止不动的，而是运动、变化的。他指出每当一种事物由于运动而变化为另一种事物时，那么这种事物原来具有的作用，也就随着事物的变化而变化了。他说：“生形之非死形，死形之非生形，区已革矣”。这就是说，从活人变为死人，这是由一种物质形态变为另一种物质形态的质变，由于质变了，因此活人所具有的“有知”的作用也就因变为死人而变为无知了。这样，他就进一步的说明了他的“形存则神存，形谢则神灭”的论点。
    范缜认为人的神经作用乃是人的生理器官的产物，人的生理活动乃是人的心理活动的基础，他说：“手等有痛痒之知”，“五脏各有所司”等等。虽然由于当时科学水平的限制，他误认为“是非之虑，心器所主”，把一个血液循环的器官误认为是思维的器官，但是这在当时还是难以避免的错误，并不影响他在哲学最高问题上的正确性。作为一个什么是思维器官的具体问题，他是错了；但作为思维一定是思维器官的产物，即指精神一定是物质的产物的原则问题，他是对的。
    范缜的错误，是在于他把人的思维完全归结于人的生理过程。例如他认为“圣人之体”决定了“圣人之神”，“凡人之器”决定了“凡人之神”，他还不理解人的思维的能力虽然是人的思维器官的产物，但思维能力的发展程度和思维的内容，却是由人所不能离开的社会条件所决定的。因为他不理解这一点，因而从生理器官决定人的一切的机械论出发，就做出了和唯心论者一样的结论，认为圣人生就的是圣体，凡人生就的是凡器，而完全没有注意到社会条件对于人的影响。此外，当佛教徒用儒家典籍上的鬼神故事和他辩难时，他终于被迫在不承认“人灭而为鬼”的条件下，承认了一种似乎与人世无关的鬼，他说：“有人焉，有鬼焉，幽明之别也”，因此，和马克思主义以前的一切无神论者一样，他不是也不可能是一个彻底的、科学的无神论者。
    在“神灭论”的末尾，范缜指出了他的这一著作的政治目的。他指责了当时由于佛教盛行而产生的种种恶果，即对于风俗、人口、生产、军事、行政、财政等等方面的不良影响，然后就阐述了他自己的政治思想。他所提出的什么“小人甘其垄亩”，“下有余以奉其上”等等的政治主张，也无非是要农民好好种地养活地主而已。他想用他的哲学理论说明他的这种政治主张，关于这一点，他自己不仅没有掩饰，而且公开申明他是把自己的哲学理论作为政治斗争中“用此道也”的武器的。
    震惊朝野的“神灭论”发表之后，皇帝萧衍和大僧正释法云发动了60多个僧俗“名流”，写了70多篇文章来反驳范缜，在这些反驳的文章中，除了指责范缜“违经”、“乖理”、“灭圣”、“背视”之外，就是列举出书上的鬼神来证明鬼神的存在，而对于范缜的“神灭论”的基本思想，谁也无法驳倒它。后来，范缜又写了一篇“答曹舍人”作了代表性的答辩。范缜“自谓辩摧众口，日服千人”，就连他的论敌也是不能不“每服缜简诣”的。
    范缜的“神灭论”，已经历了1450年的悠长岁月，纵然其中有若干错误吧，但是，如果历史地看待范缜，人们都会觉得在当时的条件下，他对物质和精神的关系能够观察到那种正确的程度，是很难得的。他是我国历史上的伟大思想家之一，他的唯物论的思想，是我们应该批判地承继的历史遗产之一。
