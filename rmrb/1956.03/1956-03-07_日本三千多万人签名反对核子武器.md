Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo dispatch: The Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs announced that it has collected 33.19 million signatures to date, demanding a ban on nuclear weapons and relief for Japanese atomic bomb victims. This number of signatures is close to 40% of Japan's total population.

The movement to provide relief to atomic bomb victims, initiated by the Council last year, is receiving enthusiastic encouragement and support both domestically and internationally.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo dispatch: On the afternoon of March 5th, the Japan Socialist Party, led by Secretary-General Inejiro Asanuma, submitted an appeal to the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Allison. In the appeal, the Socialist Party stated that the United States, disregarding the resolutions passed by both houses of the Japanese Diet demanding a ban on nuclear bomb tests, has decided to test nuclear weapons in the Pacific region, which is extremely regrettable. The Socialist Party strongly demanded that the United States immediately cease this test and promptly conclude an international agreement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs.
