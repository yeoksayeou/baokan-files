Title: The Will of the Japanese People Is Not to Be Insulted

The Japanese Foreign Ministry's March 24th announcement expressing dissatisfaction with the United States' refusal to cease nuclear weapons testing on Eniwetok Atoll in the Pacific is clearly justified and necessary. The United States' nuclear weapons testing in trust territories and on the high seas of the Pacific is not only a violation of the United Nations Charter regarding the trusteeship system, but also a serious breach of fundamental principles of international law concerning freedom of the high seas, directly threatening the lives and safety of the Japanese people and their fishing rights.

The Japanese people, in order to defend their own rights and safety, have waged a heroic and unyielding struggle against this domineering and illegal behavior of the United States on the high seas of the Pacific. The signature campaign of the Japanese people demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons has now collected 38.5 million signatures, which is enough to show that their will is not to be insulted.

The principle of freedom of the high seas is a recognized principle of international law, and the United States has also acknowledged and insisted on this principle. In 1826, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Story declared, "The sea is the common highway of all, for the use of all." The Atlantic Charter, signed by U.S. President Roosevelt in 1941, stipulated that postwar peace should "enable all men to traverse the high seas and oceans without hindrance." It is obvious that the current U.S. practice of arbitrarily designating a "danger zone" of over 370,000 square nautical miles on the high seas of the Pacific, cutting off all maritime traffic, and preventing aircraft, ships, and personnel from other countries from entering or passing through is a gross violation of the principle of freedom of the high seas and a betrayal of the international obligations undertaken by the United States.

The United States attempts to justify its crime of violating international law by citing the "international practice of conducting military exercises on the high seas," but this is impossible. As the Japanese Foreign Ministry's communiqué points out: "The international practice of conducting military exercises on the high seas cannot be interpreted as allowing atomic tests to be conducted in areas that affect free navigation and fishing." Leaving aside the legality of the so-called U.S. practice, the scope and extent of the danger to high seas safety posed by U.S. nuclear weapons testing is simply incomparable to ordinary naval exercises. Furthermore, nuclear weapons are not legitimate weapons at all, and there is no international practice of nuclear weapons testing that endangers the safety of the high seas and freedom of navigation. The U.S. nuclear weapons tests on Bikini Atoll and on the high seas of the Pacific in 1954, which killed Japanese fishermen and violated the safety of the high seas, were also crimes against international law and have long been justly condemned by world opinion.

The United States said in its reply to Japan's note that it had taken extensive safety precautions for this test and could eliminate any danger, which is simply a lie. In 1954, when the United States illegally conducted atomic bomb tests on the high seas of the Pacific, it also claimed to have taken precautions and designated a "danger zone." But the facts show that Japanese "Lucky Dragon" fishermen fishing 80 miles outside that "danger zone" were injured and killed. At the recent meeting of the United Nations Trusteeship Council, the Indian representative to the United Nations, Menon, refuted this absurd argument that the United States could take safety measures in advance. The United States' invocation of this long-debunked cliché in its note to Japan is clearly just an attempt to cover up its barbaric crimes of murder.

The United States said in its note that if the U.S. nuclear weapons tests cause losses to Japan, the United States will consider paying compensation to Japan, which is a great insult to the Japanese government and people! Everyone knows that it would not be difficult for the United States to throw out a few dirty dollars, but any losses suffered by the Japanese people are irreparable. The dead cannot be brought back to life, the disabled cannot be restored, and the inner grief of orphans and widows will never be erased. What can the United States use to "compensate"! This statement by the United States, which insults human dignity, can only arouse the infinite hatred and indignation of the Japanese people and all righteous people!

The United States, disregarding the dissatisfaction of the Japanese government and the resolute opposition of the Japanese people and the people of all countries in the world, insists on conducting nuclear weapons tests on the high seas of the Pacific, which is a serious provocation to the safety of the Japanese people and to peace in Asia. Now that the United Nations Disarmament Commission's Subcommittee is meeting in London, and the people of the world are increasingly demanding disarmament and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, the United States is flaunting nuclear weapons on the high seas of the Pacific, which shows that it is still using the bankrupt "policy of strength" to deal with the people of Japan and Asia. In fact, the United States is overestimating its capabilities; its so-called atomic "superiority" no longer exists, and this so-called "policy of strength" cannot scare the people of Asian countries at all.

Now, the Japanese people's movement against U.S. nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific is surging even more strongly, and it has received the support of more and more governments and peoples in Asia and even the world. The United States, at the cost of violating international law and endangering the safety and rights of the Japanese people, creates tensions in Asia and the Pacific, and all it will get is a greater failure.

### 日本人民的意志是不可侮的

    日本人民的意志是不可侮的
    日本外务省在三月二十四日发表公报，对美国拒绝停止在太平洋恩纳威托克岛试验核子武器的照会表示不满，显然是完全正当的和必要的。因为美国在托管领土和太平洋公海上进行核子武器试验，不仅是破坏联合国宪章关于托管制度的违法罪行，并且严重地违反了国际法上关于公海自由的基本原则，直接威胁着日本人民的生命安全和海上捕鱼权利。
    日本人民为了维护自身的权利和安全，对于美国这种在太平洋公海上横行霸道的违法行为，进行了英勇的坚强不屈的斗争。日本人民要求禁止原子武器的签名运动，到现在已经征集了三千八百五十万个签名，就足以说明他们的意志是不可侮的。
    公海自由原则是一个公认的国际法原则，美国也曾承认和坚持过这个原则。1826年美国最高法院法官斯托里就曾宣称：“海洋是大家的公共的大道，是供大家使用的”。1941年美国总统罗斯福签字的大西洋宪章规定，战后的和平应“足使全人类可在公海及大海洋上自由来往，不受阻挠”。显而易见，现在美国任意在太平洋公海上划定一个面积广达三十七万多平方海里的“危险区域”，切断一切海上交通，阻止其他国家的飞机、船舶和人员进入或通过的作法，是对公海自由原则的粗暴破坏，是对美国所承担的国际义务的背信弃义的行为。
    美国企图以“在公海进行军事演习的国际惯例”来为它这种破坏国际法的罪行辩解，这是办不到的。正如日本外务省的公报所指出的：“在公海进行军事演习的国际惯例，不能够解释成为可以在影响到自由航行和捕鱼的区域进行原子试验。”这里且不说美国所谓惯例的合法性如何，单就美国试验核子武器危害公海安全的范围和程度来说，就根本不能同一般的海上军事演习相比。并且，核子武器根本不是什么合法的武器，危害公海安全和航行自由的核子武器试验的国际惯例是不存在的。美国1954年在比基尼岛和太平洋公海上试验核子武器，杀害了日本渔民和侵犯了公海安全，同样是破坏国际法的罪行，早就遭到世界舆论的公正痛斥。
    美国在答复日本的照会中说，它对这次试验采取了广泛的安全预防措施，可以消除任何危险，根本是骗人的。1954年美国在太平洋公海上非法进行原子弹试验的时候，也宣称采取了预防措施，并且也划定一个“危险区域”。可是事实说明，当时在距离那个“危险区域”八十英里以外捕鱼的日本“福龙丸”渔民遭受了杀伤。在最近举行的联合国托管理事会的会议上，印度驻联合国代表梅农就曾驳斥过美国这种所谓能够预先采取安全措施的谎谬论调。美国在致日本的照会中又搬出这种早就被揭破了的滥调来，显然只是企图掩饰它的野蛮的杀人罪行。
    美国的照会中说，如果美国的核子武器试验使日本受到损失，美国将考虑对日本付给赔偿的问题，这对于日本政府和人民是莫大的侮辱！谁也知道，美国扔出几块臭钱是不会困难的，可是日本人民所遭受的任何损失都是无法弥补的。人死不能复生，残废不能复原，孤儿寡妇内心的悲痛将永远不能磨灭，试问美国凭什么来“赔偿”！美国这种侮辱人类尊严的说法，只有激起日本人民和一切正义人民对它的无限痛恨和愤慨！
    美国不顾日本政府的不满，不顾日本人民和世界各国人民的坚决反对，硬要在太平洋公海上进行核子武器试验，是对日本人民安全和亚洲和平的严重挑衅。现在联合国裁军委员会小组委员会正在伦敦举行会议，世界各国人民越来越普遍地要求裁减军备和禁止原子武器氢武器，美国却要在太平洋公海上炫耀核子武器，可见它仍然在沿用破产了的“实力政策”来对付日本和亚洲的人民。其实，美国这是不自量力，它的所谓原子“优势”早就不存在了，这种所谓“实力政策”根本吓不倒亚洲各国的人民。
    现在，日本人民反对美国在太平洋试验核子武器的运动是更加澎湃起来了，并且得到了亚洲以至世界越来越多的国家政府和人民的支持。美国不惜破坏国际公法、危害日本人民的安全和权利，来在亚洲及太平洋制造紧张局势，它所得到的只会是更大的失败。
