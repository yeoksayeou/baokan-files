    Today's Hetao
    Wang Zhibin
    Setting off by car from Baotou City in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and traveling west along the winding Ula Mountains, after passing Xishan Mouth, one enters the fertile Hetao Plain.
    Hetao is an administrative region within Inner Mongolia where various ethnic groups reside. This expanse of over nine thousand nine hundred square kilometers of wilderness, like the face of a folding fan, is sandwiched between the Yin Mountains and the Yellow River. The Yellow River and the Ula River, from Sanshengong in the west to Wuliangsu Lake in the east, divide and encircle, forming the natural water intake and drainage for the ten major canals of the Hetao. The calm and wide Yellow River nurtures millions of mu of land in the Hetao. Here, canals meander, and the Yellow River's water is abundant. It is suitable for both agriculture and animal husbandry, and is also rich in fish production.
    The Hetao is located on the Inner Mongolian Plateau, with sparse rainfall, averaging 200 millimeters annually, concentrated in July and August. However, the average annual evaporation reaches 1,800 millimeters. Therefore, without the Yellow River's water conservancy, cultivation would be difficult. Local farmers often use the phrase "no watering, no growth" to describe the characteristics of planting. The Yellow River's water conservancy is an advantageous condition for the development of production by Hetao farmers; at the same time, it is also a great burden. Most of the canals here were dug following the natural terrain, winding and irregular. Under the destruction of reactionary rule, most of the canals became silted up due to years of disrepair, and the irrigated area gradually shrank, while the disaster-stricken area gradually expanded. Farmers along the banks suffered from spring drought and autumn floods every year. In 1935, high river water submerged the two counties of Wuyuan and Linhe. In 1943, a single flood submerged 400,000 mu of cultivated land. After liberation, the Party and the government led the farmers to implement a system of democratic canal management and rational water use, and nearly 200,000 farmers have been repairing the canals every year. Water-saving and water-concentrating equipment has been added to each main canal and large branch canal. A 700-li long flood control dam has been built along the Yellow River to prevent major floods. In 1952, the state invested in the construction of the large-scale Liberation Sluice Gate. In recent years, the irrigated area has been expanding year by year, and by 1955, the irrigated area had expanded from 2.9 million mu in the early days of liberation to 4 million mu.
    In the Hetao, the process of production and water conservancy development is also the process of ethnic unity development. A long time ago, this area was entirely inhabited by Mongolian people who lived by animal husbandry. About a hundred years ago, Han Chinese bureaucrats and landlords invaded the area, colluded with Mongolian princes, swindled away pastures, and opened canals for cultivation. Later, the bureaucrats and landlords organized reclamation teams to reclaim wasteland everywhere. Mongolian and Han laborers, in years of hardship, suffered the oppression and destruction of the reactionary ruling class, their economies collapsed, and they lost their land and livestock. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, farmers of Han, Hui, and Mongolian ethnicities jointly carried out land reform, destroying the feudal rule that weighed on the farmers of all ethnicities. However, after the Mongolian farmers were divided the land, because of the lack of business sense, the state had to supply food rations every year, such as 23 of 41 Mongolian families in Xugai Township needing state supplies every year. In villages where Mongolians and Han Chinese live together, the livestock of Han people is not as well managed as that of Mongolians. For example, in Mantouhe Shao Township, Darat Banner in 1954, the lamb survival rate of Mongolian people was more than 70%, while the lamb survival rate of Han people was only 50%. In order to facilitate the common development of agricultural and pastoral production, in 1954, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the two ethnic groups established twenty-nine joint ethnic societies. Since then, the lives of Mongolian farmers have undergone significant changes. Badahu, a Mongolian from Xugai Township, Fourth District, Linhe County, had fifty sheep and planted forty mu of land, but because his planting techniques were not strong, he only harvested seven or eight dan of grain a year. In 1954, he joined the cooperative, and the forty mu of land was managed by the cooperative in a unified manner, harvesting twenty-five dan of grain (wheat suffered from rain damage), which increased his income by 20% compared to being outside the cooperative. The Mongolian farmer Alabudai lost his mother when he was seven years old, and left home to wander everywhere at the age of ten. Before liberation, he suffered the torment of hardship and could not find a full meal anywhere. After liberation, he was given two cows, five sheep, and eleven mu of land, but his own planting skills were low, and he only harvested three or four dan of grain each year, needing state relief for food and clothing every year. In 1954, he joined the agricultural cooperative and herded cattle for the cooperative. In 1955, his income increased compared to before, and he had forty yuan left over besides his own consumption. The 33-household Unity Cooperative in Xugai Township increased grain production by 25,000 jin in 1955, despite the wheat disaster, compared to mutual aid groups, and the average income of Mongolian and Han cooperative members increased by 10%. This year, the Unity Cooperative has expanded to 100 households, and animal husbandry has also joined the cooperative. Cooperative members estimate that after applying manure to the farmland, the yield per mu can be increased by 30 jin. Animal husbandry will be managed by the cooperative in a unified manner, building sheds and pens, and net income can be increased by 40%. After seeing the benefits of the integration of agriculture and animal husbandry, Mongolian people have requested to join agricultural cooperatives one after another. By the end of January this year, 90% of more than 9,000 households had joined ninety joint ethnic agricultural and pastoral cooperatives. The de facto inequality between ethnic groups for many years will be eliminated with the development of the country's socialist construction.
    Chairman Mao's instructions on the issue of agricultural cooperation were transmitted to the countryside, and like everywhere else in the country, a magnificent agricultural cooperation movement was launched here. Farmers collectively registered in groups, and the whole family, whole group, and whole village joined the agricultural cooperative together. Farmers said: Land reform is a small turnaround, and cooperation is a big turnaround. By the end of December 1955, Hetao agricultural cooperatives had developed to 1,229, with 85% of farming households joining. By the end of January, farmers in various places had built 278 fully socialist agricultural cooperatives on the basis of 457 old cooperatives, with 63.5% of farming households joining. More than 90,000 farming and pastoral households are heading towards the broad road of common prosperity.
    The "National Agricultural Development Outline (Draft)" proposed by the Party Central Committee for the period from 1956 to 1967 has brought endless strength to the cooperative farmers of the Hetao. In every village and field, men and women, old and young, are as busy as during the autumn harvest. People accumulating fertilizer, hunting sparrows, and catching mice are scattered like stars; vehicles pulling soil and delivering fertilizer are connected in rows. The farmers of the Hetao will complete the grain production target of the first Five-Year Plan in 1956, with a unit area yield reaching 222 jin, and the total output increasing by 120 million jin compared to 1955.

    今日河套
    王智斌
    从内蒙古自治区包头市坐上汽车，沿着曲折的乌拉山西行，过了西山咀，便进入了富饶的河套平原。
    河套是内蒙古境内民族杂居的一个行政区。这块九千九百余平方公里的原野，像一张折扇的扇面被夹在阴山和黄河之间。黄河和乌拉河西起三盛公东至乌梁素海，分流环抱，形成河套十大干渠的天然进水和退水。平静而宽阔的黄河哺育了河套数百万亩土地。这里，渠道迤逦，黄水丰盈。宜农宜牧，还富有渔产。
    河套地处内蒙古高原，雨量稀少，年雨量达二百公厘，集中在七、八月间，但是每年蒸发量平均达到一千八百公厘。这样，如果没有黄河水利是很难种植的。当地农民常用“不浇不长”四个字来形容种植特点。黄河水利是河套农民发展生产的一个优越条件；同时也是很大的负担。这儿的渠道多系顺天然地势开挖，蜿蜒绕逆很不规整。在反动统治的摧残下，大部渠道因为年久失修而淤塞，灌溉面积逐年缩小，受灾面积逐年扩大。沿岸农民每年都受春旱秋涝的灾害，1935年河水高涨曾淹没了五原、临河两个县，1943年一次洪水，淹了四十万亩耕地。解放以后，党和政府领导农民推行了民主管理渠道，合理用水的制度，每年都有近二十万农民修整渠道。各干渠、大支渠增加了节水、束水的设备。黄河沿岸筑成七百里长的防洪坝，防止了较大的水患。1952年国家投资建成规模较大的解放闸。几年来灌溉面积逐年扩大，到1955年灌溉面积已经由解放初期的二百九十万亩扩大到四百万亩。
    在河套，生产和水利的发展过程，也是民族团结的发展过程。很早以前，这里全是以牧为生的蒙古族人民，大约一百年前，汉族的官僚、地主侵入套内，同蒙古族王爷勾结，骗走牧场，开渠种地，以后，官僚、地主又组织屯垦队，到处开荒。蒙古族和汉族的劳动人民在苦难的年月里，受尽了反动统治阶级的压迫和摧残，经济破产，失去了土地和牛羊。解放以后，汉、回和蒙古各族农民在共产党领导下联合进行了土地改革，摧毁了压在各族农民头上的封建统治。但是，蒙古族农民分得了土地以后，由于不善于经营，年年要国家供应口粮，如蓿荄乡四十一户蒙古族，就有二十三户年年要国家供应。蒙古族和汉族杂居的乡村里，汉人的牲畜就不如蒙古人经营的好，如达拉特后旗蔓头合少乡1954年蒙古族人民羊羔成活率在70％以上，汉民羊羔成活率仅达50％。为了有利于农牧业生产的共同发展，1954年两族人民在共产党领导下成立了二十九个民族联合社。从此以后，蒙古族农民的生活有了显著的变化。临河县四区蓿荄乡蒙古族人民巴达乎有五十只羊，种四十亩地，因为种地技术不强，一年只打七、八石粮。1954年，他参加了合作社，四十亩地由社统一经营打了二十五石粮（小麦受雨灾），使自己的收入也比在社外提高了20％。蒙古族农民阿拉布代，七岁的时候就死了母亲，十岁就离开家到处流浪。解放以前，他受尽了苦难的折磨，到处找不到一顿饱饭。解放以后，他分了二头牛、五只羊、十一亩地，但是自己种地技术低，每年只打三、四石粮，年年要国家救济吃、穿。1954年他加入了农业合作社，给社放牛，1955年，他的收入比以前增加了，除了自己的食用，还剩四十元。蓿荄乡三十三户的团结社，1955年在小麦受灾的情况下比在互助组增产粮食二万五千斤，蒙古、汉族社员的收入平均增加10％。今年团结社扩大到一百户，牧业也入了社，社员估计在农田施粪肥后，每亩地可增产三十斤。牧业由社统一经营，修棚搭圈，纯收入可增加40％。蒙古族人民看到农牧结合的好处以后，纷纷要求加入农业合作社，到今年一月底，九千多户中，已有90％加入了九十个民族联合农牧合作社。多少年来，民族之间的事实上不平等将随着国家社会主义建设事业的发展得到消除。
    毛主席关于农业合作化问题的指示传到农村，同全国各地一样，在这里掀起了一个波澜壮阔的农业合作化运动。农民成群结伙地集体报名，全家、全组、全村一同加入农业合作社的事，到处都有。农民说：土地改革是小翻身，合作化是大翻身。到1955年12月底，河套农业合作社发展到1，229个，入社农户达到85％。到一月底，各地农民在457个老社基础上建成278个全社会主义的农业合作社，入社农户达到63.5％。九万多农户和牧户走向大家富裕的康庄大道。
    党中央提出的1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案），给合作化后的河套农民带来了无穷无尽的力量。每个乡村里、田野上，男女老少像收秋一样的忙碌。积肥打雀和捕鼠的人们，星棋点点；拉土送肥的车辆衔接成行。河套农民在1956年将要完成第一个五年计划的粮食生产指标，单位面积产量达到222斤，总产量比1955年增加一亿二千万斤。
