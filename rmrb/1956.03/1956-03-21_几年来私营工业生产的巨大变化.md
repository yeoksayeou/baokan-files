    Huge Changes in Private Industrial Production in Recent Years
    National Bureau of Statistics
    Since January of this year, the socialist transformation of private industry by the state has launched a vigorous upsurge. Private industrial enterprises in 118 large and medium-sized cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shenyang, Chongqing, Xi'an, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Harbin, Qingdao, Jinan, and Wuxi, have successively and almost entirely implemented joint state-private ownership. Preliminary statistics show that in January alone, more than 60,000 private industrial enterprises across the country were transformed into joint state-private industrial enterprises. By the end of January this year, the total output value of private industry accounted for approximately 2% of the total industrial output value. It is evident that China's five-year plan for the transformation of private industry has been greatly accelerated and overfulfilled.

    In recent years, with the expansion of the state's work on the transformation of private industry, private industry has also undergone tremendous changes in production. These changes can be seen from the rapid growth of socialist industry and the annual decline in the proportion of private industry in total industry:

    1. Percentage of total industrial output value accounted for by private industrial output value:

    2. Percentage of total industrial product output accounted for by the output of major private industrial products:

    The above statistics show that after three years of recovery work, coupled with the construction work of the first three years of the First Five-Year Plan, on the industrial production front, just like other economic fronts, the socialist阵地 expanded rapidly, and the capitalist阵地 shrank significantly. In other words, the socialist economic component has gained a decisive advantage over the capitalist economic component.

    In recent years, the state's socialist transformation of private industry has been carried out through the form of state capitalism. During the period of national economic recovery, this transformation mainly took the form of intermediate and elementary forms of state capitalism. Therefore, the proportion of the value of products processed, ordered, exclusively sold, and purchased by the state in the total output value of private industry has increased year by year. This proportion was 12% in 1949, 56% in 1952, 62% in 1953, 79% in 1954, and 82% in 1955. Looking at the situation of large-scale industries, in 1955, the value of products processed and ordered by the state accounted for 91% of the total output value of private industry, while the self-produced and self-sold portion of private industry was less than 9% of its total production. This means that in recent years, the production of private industry has basically been incorporated into the track of state capitalism.

    Obviously, after private industry is transformed into an intermediate form of state capitalism, the enterprise is still owned by the capitalist, and the enterprise's operation and management are basically still carried out in accordance with the capitalist method. Therefore, the contradictions between supply and demand in many industries, the contradictions between state-owned and private enterprises, the contradictions between large and small enterprises, and the contradictions between regions cannot be fundamentally resolved, and they become obstacles to the continued development of social productive forces. In order to completely resolve these contradictions and enable the state to make comprehensive arrangements and reorganizations for various industries in accordance with the needs of national economic development, it is necessary to change capitalist ownership and first further promote these enterprises to joint state-private ownership throughout the industry. In the past few years, the state's work of expanding joint state-private industrial enterprises has been advancing step by step, from major industries to minor industries, and from large cities to small and medium-sized cities. The speed of expansion is also quite rapid. For example, taking the total output value of joint state-private industrial enterprises in 1949 as 100, it was 623 in 1952, 917 in 1953, 2,317 in 1954, and 3,265 in 1955. It can be seen that since 1954, when the expansion of joint state-private industrial enterprises was planned nationwide, its growth rate has accelerated significantly.

    The annual growth of joint state-private industrial enterprises has led to a trend of annual growth in the proportion of total output value of joint state-private industrial enterprises in total industrial output value. For example, it accounted for 2% in 1949, 5% in 1952, 6% in 1953, 12% in 1954, and 16% in 1955.

    Beginning at the beginning of 1955, various parts of the country made overall arrangements for private industry and achieved great results, but many problems still cannot be completely resolved. Years of experience tell us that the arrangement of private industrial production must be an arrangement for the entire industry, and it must be a combination of arrangement and reorganization; otherwise, the difficulties of many backward enterprises cannot be overcome. To carry out a reasonable reorganization of the entire industry, it is necessary to merge or eliminate some particularly backward enterprises, but this is impossible under the condition that these enterprises preserve capitalist private ownership. Therefore, it is necessary to consider joint state-private ownership throughout the industry. The result of the first implementation of joint state-private ownership throughout the industry in certain industries last year (such as the gold pen industry in Shanghai) effectively overcame the difficulties in production arrangements, which prepared the necessary and extremely favorable conditions for joint state-private ownership throughout the industry.

    Since the second half of last year, the work of expanding joint state-private ownership in various places has been carried out on the basis of the arrangement of the entire industry, especially since this year, under the influence of the rapid development of agricultural cooperation, an upsurge of socialist transformation of private industry and commerce has been launched in various places. In January, more than 60,000 private industrial enterprises realized joint state-private ownership, and now only a very small number of private industrial enterprises have not yet implemented joint ownership.

    In summary, it can be seen that the state has achieved a victory of decisive significance in the socialist transformation of private industry.

    几年来私营工业生产的巨大变化
    国家统计局
    今年一月以来，国家对私营工业的社会主义改造已经掀起了一个汹涌澎湃的高潮。北京、天津、上海、沈阳、重庆、西安、武汉、广州、哈尔滨、青岛、济南、无锡等共118个大中城市的私营工业，已经先后几乎全部实行了公私合营。据初步统计，仅今年一月份，全国已经有六万多户的私营工业企业转为公私合营工业企业。到今年一月底，私营工业总产值占全部工业总产值的比重约2％左右。由此可见，我国对私营工业改造的五年计划已经大大提前并且超额地完成了。
    几年来，随着国家对私营工业改造工作的扩大，私营工业在生产上也起了巨大的变化。这种变化可从社会主义工业的迅速增长和私营工业所占全部工业比重的逐年下降看出：
    1、私营工业总产值占全部工业总产值的百分比：
    2、私营工业主要产品产量占全部工业产品产量百分比：
    上列统计数字表明：经过三年的恢复工作，加上第一个五年计划头三年的建设工作，在工业生产战线上也像其他经济战线一样，社会主义的阵地迅速地扩大了，资本主义的阵地大大地缩小了。换句话说，社会主义经济成分对于资本主义经济成分已经取得决定性的优势地位了。
    几年来，国家对于私营工业的社会主义改造是通过国家资本主义的形式进行的。在国民经济恢复时期，这种改造的形式，大部分还是采取国家资本主义的中级形式和低级形式。因此，国家加工、订货、包销、收购的产品价值占私营工业总产值的比重逐年上升。这个比重在1949年为12％，1952年为56％，1953年为62％，1954年为79％，1955年为82％。如再从大型工业情况来看，1955年国家加工、订货等产品价值已经占到私营工业总产值的91％，而私营工业自产自销部分不到其全部生产的9％。这就是说，近几年来私营工业的生产基本上纳入了国家资本主义的轨道。
    显然的，私营工业转变为国家资本主义中级形式以后，企业仍是资本家所有，企业的经营管理基本上仍是按照资本主义方式去进行，因此，许多行业供产销之间的矛盾，国营和私营之间的矛盾，大企业和小企业之间的矛盾，地区和地区之间的矛盾等等，都得不到根本的解决，成为继续发展社会生产力的障碍。为着彻底解决这些矛盾，使国家有可能按照国民经济发展的需要对各行各业进行全面的安排改组，就需要改变资本家所有制，首先要把这些企业进一步推向全行业的公私合营。过去几年来，国家扩展公私合营工业的工作是逐步前进的，是从主要行业推广到次要行业、从大城市扩展到中小城市的。扩展的速度也是相当迅速的。如以1949年公私合营工业总产值为100，1952年为623，1953年为917，1954年为2，317，1955年为3，265。可以看出，自1954年全国有计划地扩展公私合营工业以后，其增长的速度已经显著地加快了。
    公私合营工业的逐年增长，使公私合营工业总产值占全部工业总产值的比重呈现了逐年增长的趋势。如1949年占2％，1952年占5％，1953年占6％，1954年占12％，1955年占16％。
    从1955年年初开始，全国各地对私营工业进行了统筹安排，并且获得了很大的成绩，但是许多问题仍然得不到彻底的解决。几年来的经验告诉我们，对私营工业生产的安排，必须是全行业的安排，而且必须是安排同改组相结合，否则许多落后企业的困难仍然无法克服。要进行全行业的合理改组，就必须合并或淘汰一些特别落后的企业，但是在这些企业保存资本家私有制的条件下，这是不可能的，因而就有必要考虑全行业的公私合营。去年某些行业（如上海的金笔业）首先实行全行业公私合营的结果，有效地克服了生产安排中的困难，这就替全行业的公私合营准备了必要的和极其有利的条件。
    自去年下半年以来，各地扩展公私合营的工作，就是在全行业安排的基础上进行了全行业合营的，特别是今年以来，在农业合作化迅速发展的影响下，各地掀起了对私营工商业的社会主义改造的高潮。在一月份，就有六万多户的私营工业企业实现了公私合营，现在尚未合营的私营工业企业只占很少数了。
    综上所述，可知国家对私营工业的社会主义改造工作已经取得了具有决定意义的胜利。
