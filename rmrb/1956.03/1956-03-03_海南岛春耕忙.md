Hainan Island's spring plowing is in full swing. In Qiongdong, Lehui, and Wanning, where the season is earlier, rice transplanting was completed last month, and field management is now underway.

Under the encouragement of the Thousand Catty Movement, farmers in various parts of Hainan Island are working on fertilizer accumulation and rice transplanting during the day, and repairing water conservancy projects with lights at night. In the fertilizer accumulation campaign, Yai County has found more than 40 kinds of fertilizer sources and is now striving to achieve 10,000 catties of fertilizer per mu. In Tunchang, Qiongshan, and Chengmai counties, the average fertilizer application per mu has reached 3,000 catties, an increase of four to five times compared with previous years. As of now, the island has built 3,869 medium and small-sized water conservancy projects, converting more than 360,000 mu of single-cropping fields into double-cropping.

    海南岛春耕忙
    海南岛的春耕正在大忙。季节较早的琼东、乐会、万宁上月已插完秧，正在进行田间管理。
    海南岛各地农民在千斤运动的鼓舞下，做到了白天积肥、插秧，夜间点灯修水利。崖县在开展积肥运动中，找到了40多种肥源，现在正争取做到每亩万斤肥。屯昌、琼山、澄迈三个县，平均每亩施肥已达到了3，000斤。施肥量比往年增加了四倍至五倍。截至目前止，全岛已兴修中、小型水利3，869宗，使36万多亩单造田改种为双造。（新海南报编辑部）
