Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 7th: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has promulgated a decision on celebrating "March 8" International Women's Day.

The decision states that the working people of our motherland are celebrating this year's "March 8" International Women's Day amidst the nationwide political and labor upsurge caused by the historic resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Realizing the plans stipulated by the 20th Party Congress for vigorously developing the national economy and socialist culture will be another major step forward in the development of socialist society. For the first time in human history, socialist society has guaranteed women genuine freedom, equal rights with men, and unlimited creative possibilities in all aspects of production, society, science, and cultural life.

The decision continues, in Soviet society, women are active participants in communist construction. Millions of women are working with all the people in factories, collective farms, state farms, schools, and research institutes, creating enormous material and spiritual wealth. Among experts with higher education in the Soviet Union, 53% are women, women account for 76% of doctors, 70% of teachers, and over 67% of staff in scientific and cultural education institutions, and nearly 10,000 women have received degrees and honorary titles. Soviet women actively participate in all state affairs. Their achievements have been widely recognized by the people and highly valued by the Communist Party and the Soviet government.

The decision continues that the directives of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union regarding the Sixth Five-Year Plan stipulate many important measures to further improve mothers' working and living conditions. Working women around the world see from the example of the situation of Soviet women that the true liberation of women is only possible under the socialist system. The experience of all the People's Democracies in Europe and Asia also proves this point. What these countries have done in the past decade to ensure the actual equality of women far exceeds what was done in a hundred years under bourgeois democracy.

The decision states, after describing the miserable plight of working women in capitalist countries, that women in capitalist countries are increasingly actively rising up to fight for peace and international security and against the policy of the forces of aggression to launch new wars. The women of the Soviet Union, great China, and other countries of the socialist family inspire women all over the world with their achievements, giving them confidence in the struggle against all forms of social and national oppression.

The decision concludes by congratulating Soviet women on their further achievements in the struggle to realize the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, in all aspects of their activities in politics, production, science, and culture, and in the noble cause of educating children.

    苏共中央发布关于庆祝“三八”国际妇女节的决定
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科7日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会颁布了关于庆祝“三八”国际妇女节的决定。
    决定说，我们祖国的劳动人民，在苏共第二十次代表大会的历史性决议所引起的全民政治和劳动热潮的情况下，庆祝今年的“三八”国际妇女节。实现第二十次党代表大会所规定的大力发展国民经济和社会主义文化的计划，将是在社会主义社会的发展中又前进一大步。社会主义社会在人类历史上第一次向妇女们保证了真正的自由、同男子平等的权利，以及在生产、社会、科学和文化生活各方面的无限的创造的可能性。
    决定接着说，在苏维埃社会中，妇女是共产主义建设的积极参加者。千百万妇女和全体人民一起在工厂、集体农庄、国营农场、学校和研究所里工作，创造着巨大的物质和精神财富。在苏联受过高等教育的专家中，有53％是妇女，医生中妇女占76％，教师中妇女占70％，在科学和文化教育机关的工作人员中，妇女占67％以上，差不多有1万个妇女获得了学位和光荣称号。苏联妇女积极参加了一切国家事务。她们的功绩得到了人民广泛的承认和共产党及苏联政府高度的评价。
    决定继续说，在苏共第二十次代表大会关于第六个五年计划的指示中，规定了许多重大的措施以进一步改善母亲的劳动条件和生活条件。全世界劳动妇女从苏联妇女状况的实例中看到：只有在社会主义制度的条件下，妇女的真正解放才有可能。欧洲和亚洲的所有人民民主国家的经验也说明这一点。这些国家在十年来为保障妇女的实际平等所做的事情远远超过在资产阶级民主的条件下一百年中所做的事情。
    决定在叙述了资本主义国家劳动妇女的悲惨处境以后说，资本主义国家的妇女越来越积极地起来为争取和平和国际安全，反对侵略势力发动新战争的政策而斗争。苏联、伟大的中国和社会主义大家庭的其他国家的妇女，以自己的成就鼓舞全世界妇女，使她们在反对各种社会压迫和民族压迫的斗争中产生信心。
    决定最后祝贺苏联妇女在争取实现苏共第二十次代表大会的决议的斗争中，在政治、生产、科学和文化等各方面的活动中，以及在教育儿童的崇高事业中，取得进一步的成就。
