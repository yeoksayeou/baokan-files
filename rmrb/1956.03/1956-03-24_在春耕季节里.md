Cultivating, Preparing Land, and Sowing Simultaneously

In Guangdong Province, more than 1.18 million mu of newly reclaimed wasteland has been widely planted with various high-yield miscellaneous grains and technical crops. In the Zhanjiang Special Zone, youth shock brigades from more than 13,000 agricultural production cooperatives have adopted the method of cultivating, preparing land, and sowing simultaneously, enabling more than 200,000 mu of wasteland to be planted with early-maturing crops such as beans, corn, and sorghum in a timely manner. In addition to using wasteland to plant hillside rice and sweet potatoes, farmers in various counties on Hainan Island also cultivate industrial raw material crops such as sisal hemp and lemongrass. In the Shaoguan Special Zone, closer to the north, some farmers have also reclaimed sloping mountain land into neat terraced fields, planting more than 100,000 world-famous Chaozhou oranges.

Nurturing Strong Seedlings, Striving for a Bumper Harvest

The intense spring ploughing production in Zhejiang Province has already begun. Planting has already begun in Pingyang County in southern Zhejiang. Lingxi District of Pingyang County, which has the earliest season, has already sown grain seeds in 70% of its seedling fields. Farmers on the Hangjiahu Plain, who plan to greatly expand the planting of double-cropping rice this year, have already begun to cultivate seedling fields for early double-cropping rice. The work of cultivating seedling fields in the Jinhua Special Zone has been carried out in most areas. In Zhuji County, where the season is earlier, 80% of the seedling fields have been cultivated, and 16,200 mu of seedling beds have been prepared. Farmers in the Jiande Special Zone and the Ningbo Special Zone are also preparing seedling fields.

When tidying up the seedling fields, all localities paid attention to the quality of the seedling fields. Counties such as Yinxian, Zhuji and Changxing adopted methods such as soaking seeds with baking soda and Xilaisheng, and cultivating semi-dry seedling fields to nurture strong seedlings and strive for a bumper harvest.

Heilongjiang and the Hetao Plain of Inner Mongolia Begin Planting Wheat

Heilongjiang Province, the northernmost province in our country, and the Hetao Plain of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which is rich in wheat, have already begun to sow spring wheat. Agricultural production cooperatives in Ning'an, Tailai, Wangkui and other counties and the Horqin Right Front Banner, which started ploughing the earliest in Heilongjiang Province, used new-style animal-powered sowing machines to sow the first batch of wheat seeds into the ground before March 20. The 208 hectares of wheat fields of the Fengshou Agricultural Production Cooperative in Sanjianfang Village, Tailai County, will be completely planted by March 25. This year, the province's wheat acreage is expected to increase by more than 20,000 hectares compared with last year, reaching 670,000 hectares.

On the Hetao Plain of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which is rich in wheat, agricultural production cooperatives such as the Lianhe, Tuanjie, and Erqu Xiangdao of Chengguan District, Wuyuan County, began sowing wheat around March 15. All channels are currently releasing water to irrigate the arid land. At the same time, six agricultural production cooperatives, including Hongxing, Yousheng, and Xianfeng in Balin Left Banner, Zhaowuda League, also successively started ploughing and sowing wheat.

Spring on Taihu Lake

In the morning, Taihu Lake is shrouded in a light mist. Countless manure-collecting farm boats sail on the lake, facing the rising sun. In the rural villages along the lake, female cooperative members wearing aprons cross small bridges in groups, heading towards the fields. The day's labor begins.

From the East China Sea to the foot of Maoshan Mountain, the area within a radius of two to three hundred li centered on Taihu Lake, including eighteen counties in the Suzhou and Songjiang Special Zones, is a famous high-yield grain area. This area plans to produce 7.5 billion jin of grain this year, an increase of 700 million jin over last year. In this first year after the basic realization of agricultural cooperation, spring ploughing production started a month earlier than in previous years. More than 9,000 agricultural production cooperatives are using the advantageous conditions of interlaced irrigation systems to convert single-cropping rice to double-cropping rice, one-crop fields to two-crop fields, and indica rice to japonica rice, totaling four million mu. Everywhere in the countryside, people are measuring and reforming farmland and discussing new cultivation methods.

On the water surfaces of lakes, ports, rivers, and streams, 160,000 farm boats and more than 300,000 people are digging river mud for fertilizer. The newly dug river mud is piled on the riverbank, and the rice straw cut by the grass cutter next to it is mixed into the river mud and composted into manure. Youth shock brigade's manure accumulation teams are picking from trees, sweeping from the ground, and scooping from the water, increasing the accumulation of a large amount of natural fertilizer. More and more agricultural production cooperatives are raising pigs to accumulate fertilizer. Jinshan County averages as many as 850 pigs per cooperative. Now, the early rice fertilizer needed for double-cropping rice in various places has been prepared.

The 780,000 farmers in this area participating in spring water conservancy projects have increased their work efficiency from one cubic meter of earthwork to more than two cubic meters after launching labor competitions. Now, the water conservancy project of more than 40 million cubic meters of earthwork has been completed ahead of schedule compared with previous years, expanding and improving the irrigation area by five million mu.

Spring Ploughing of Agricultural Production Troops

The agricultural production troops of the Xinjiang Military Region began spring ploughing in late March on 1.7 million mu of land north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. Farms in the southern Xinjiang region started sowing in early March. Aksu Victory Farm has already sown 32,000 mu of spring wheat. The Hami Reclamation Area started sowing wheat in mid-March. The more than 180,000 mu of winter wheat in the Manas River Reclamation Area will also begin spring harrowing at the end of March.

The cultivated area of the agricultural production troops of the Xinjiang Military Region will reach two million mu this year, nearly double that of last year. Since last winter and this spring, the troops have accumulated about 900 million jin of fertilizer and prepared 2,625 tons of chemical fertilizer.

Expand the Planting Area of High-Yield Crops

Spring planting has begun in various parts of Anhui Province. Farmers in the Yangtze River polder area have already prepared seedling fields and soaked rice seeds in advance. The dry seedlings of early rice are already more than an inch high. On the plains along the Huai River, farmers are busy removing field ridges and leveling land. Teams of plowing oxen are ploughing and harrowing the land in large areas. Spring corn has begun to be sown here, and sweet potatoes and potatoes have also been sprouted.

This year, the planting area of ​​high-yield crops such as early rice, corn, and "Victory No. 100" sweet potatoes planted in spring in Anhui Province has greatly exceeded that of last year. Among them, the area of ​​early rice to be planted will be three times more than last year, and the area of ​​spring corn to be planted will be more than ten times more. Almost all of these high-yield crops use improved varieties, and there have been great improvements in planting techniques. 90% of the tuber crops in the Huai River area use warm-bed seedling cultivation, and advanced seedling cultivation methods of cultivating dry seedlings have also been promoted in the Yangtze River polder area.

    在春耕季节里
    边开垦、边整地、边播种
    广东省新开垦的118万多亩荒地，已经普遍种上了各种高产的杂粮和技术作物。湛江专区有一万三千多个农业生产合作社的青年突击队，采取了边开垦、边整地、边播种的方式，使二十多万亩荒地及时地种上了豆类、玉米、高粱等早熟作物。海南岛各县农民除了利用荒地种植坡稻和番薯以外，还栽培剑麻、香茅草等工业原料作物。靠近北部的韶关专区，有些农民还把倾斜的山地，开垦成整齐的梯田，种下了十多万株世界著名的潮州柑。　　　　　　　　　（李少球）
    培育壮秧，争取丰收
    浙江省紧张的春耕生产已经开始了。浙南的平阳县已经开始播种。季节最早的平阳县灵溪区已经在70％的秧田里播下谷种。今年要大力扩种双季稻的杭嘉湖平原上的农民，已经开始耕双季早稻的秧田。金华专区耕秧田的工作已在大部分地区进行，季节较早的诸暨县有80％的秧田已经耕好，并且做好了一万六千二百亩秧板。建德专区和宁波专区的农民也正在整理秧田。
    各地在整理秧田的时候，都注意了秧田的耕作质量。鄞县、诸暨、长兴等县采用了小苏打、西力生浸种，做半旱秧田育秧等方法培育壮秧，争取丰收。
    黑龙江和内蒙古河套开始种麦
    我国最北部的黑龙江省和盛产小麦的内蒙古自治区的河套平原已经开始播种春麦。在黑龙江省最早开犁的宁安、泰来、望奎等县和郭尔罗斯后旗等地的农业生产合作社，在三月二十日以前，就用新式畜力播种机把第一批麦种播到地里。泰来县三间房村丰收农业生产合作社的208公顷麦田，到三月二十五日就可全部种完。今年全省麦田面积预计将比去年扩大两万多公顷，可达到67万公顷。
    在盛产小麦的内蒙古自治区的河套平原上，从三月十五日前后开始，有五原县城关区联合、团结和二区响导等农业生产合作社开始播种小麦。各渠道现正放水，浇灌青干地。在同一时间，昭乌达盟巴林左旗红星、优胜、先锋等六个农业生产合作社也相继开犁播种小麦。
    太湖之春
    早晨，太湖上笼罩着轻雾。数不清的积肥农船，迎着初升的太阳行驶在湖面。湖滨农村中，腰系围裙的女社员呼群结伴地跨过小桥，走向田野。一天的劳动开始了。
    从东海边到茅山脚下，以太湖为中心纵横两三百里的地方，包括苏州、松江两个专区的十八个县，是著名的粮食高产区。这个地区今年计划生产粮食75亿斤，比去年增加七亿斤。在这基本上实现农业合作化以后的第一年，春耕生产比往年提早了一个月。九千多个农业生产合作社正在利用灌溉水系交错的有利条件，把单季稻改双季稻、一熟田改两熟田、籼稻改粳稻，共四百万亩。农村中到处在丈量改制的田亩，谈论新的耕作方法。
    在湖、港、河、汊的水面上，16万只农船、30多万人在挖河泥做肥料。新挖的河泥堆上河岸，旁边切草机切断的稻草就拌到河泥里，沤制成堆肥。青年突击队的积肥小组在树上摘、地上扫、水里捞，增积了大量自然肥料。农业生产合作社养猪积肥的越来越多。金山县平均每个社养猪有850头之多。现在，各地双季稻的早稻所需肥料已经准备好了。
    这个地区参加春修水利工程的七十八万农民，在开展劳动竞赛以后，工作效率从一个土方提高到两个土方以上。现在四千多万土方的水利工程已经比往年提前完成，扩大和改善了灌溉面积五百万亩。（新华社记者  古平、邵琼、孙振）
    农业生产部队的春耕
    新疆军区农业生产部队三月下旬在天山南北170万亩的土地上开始春耕。南疆地区各农场在三月初已开始播种，阿克苏胜利一场已经播完了三万二千亩的春麦，哈密垦区在三月中旬已开始播种小麦，玛纳斯河垦区的十八万多亩冬麦，也将在三月底开始春耙。
    新疆军区农业生产部队今年的耕种面积达到二百万亩，比去年扩大了将近一倍。去冬今春以来，部队已积肥九亿斤左右，并准备了2，625吨的化学肥料。

    扩大高产作物播种面积
    安徽省各地开始春种。沿长江圩区农民已经提前做秧田、泡稻种，早稻的旱秧已一寸多高。在淮河两岸的原野上，农民们正忙着除田埂、平土地，成队的耕牛在大片的土地上犁地、耙土。这里开始播种春玉米了，甘薯和马铃薯也已经育苗。
    今年安徽省春种的早稻、玉米和“胜利百号”甘薯等高产作物，种植面积大大超过去年。其中早稻比去年要多种三倍，春玉米要多种十几倍。这些高产作物几乎全部都是采用了良种，种植技术也有很大改进。淮河沿岸地区90％的薯类都是采取温床育苗的，沿长江圩区还推广了育旱秧的先进育秧办法。　　　（据新华社讯）
