    28 People Did the Work of 42
    Comrade Editor:
    Inspired by the upsurge of agricultural cooperation, the workers of Yu Changhui's work section at the Wuhan Automobile Parts Factory have greatly increased their production enthusiasm. They have implemented the advanced experience of "multi-machine tool tending," and 28 people have done the work of 42.
    This work section originally had only 20 people, and it was necessary to add 9 people to complete the January production plan. Although the factory added 8 people to them, it also increased their production tasks by 57%. In the past, the entire production task required 42 people to complete. In order to make the existing manpower play a greater role, Yu Changhui proposed learning from the Soviet advanced experience of "multi-machine tool tending" at the work section meeting. This proposal was supported by everyone, and many workers also proposed specific methods to improve production, such as merging the washing opening and washing groove processes, having one person take charge of both the fine turning of the inner and outer diameters..., and the comrades watching the large grinding machines also proposed that they still had potential and could watch one more grinding machine. In this way, they saved labor and improved tools, thus overfulfilling the task. For example, after young worker Xu Shaoming trialed the "multi-machine tool tending" method on January 12, he watched two machine tools by himself and overfulfilled the production plan by 71%. On the same day, Youth League member Cai Binglin also completed 154% of his quota. The comrades watching the large grinding machines also increased their output by 120%.
    Currently, the workers in this work section are further looking for tricks and tapping potential, preparing to complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule in one year and two months.

    28人做了42人的工作编辑同志：
    武汉汽车配件厂余昌辉工段的工人们，在农业合作化的高潮鼓舞下，生产情绪大大提高了。他们实行了“多机床看管”的先进经验，28个人就做了42个人的工作。
    这个工段原来只有20个人，要完成1月份的生产计划还需要增加9人。厂方虽然给他们增加了8个人，但是同时给他们增加了57％的生产任务。这样，全部生产任务在过去是需要42个人才能完成的。为了使现有的人力发挥更大的作用，余昌辉就在工段的会议上提出了学习苏联先进经验“多机床看管”的倡议。这个倡议受到了大家的支持，很多工人还提出了一些改进生产的具体办法，如把洗开口和洗槽两道工序合并，把细车内元和外元两道工序由一个人负担……，看大磨床的同志也提出他们现在还有潜力，可以再多看一部磨床。就这样，他们节省了劳动力，并且改进了工具，因而就超额完成了任务。如青年工人徐少明在1月12日试行“多机床看管”法以后，一人看两部机床，超额71％完成了生产计划。青年团员蔡炳林在同一天也完成了定额的154％。看大磨床的同志，也提高了产量120％。
    目前，这个工段的工人正在进一步寻找窍门，挖掘潜力，准备以一年零二个月的时间，提前完成第一个五年计划。
