    Is the peak season over?
    Since the fourth quarter of last year, the Jinan City Company of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company has experienced stock-outs of more than 10 kinds of cotton cloth, such as floral gabardine, which are most popular with the people; even varieties that can be processed and produced locally cannot meet the supply. The masses are very dissatisfied.
    However, the leaders of this company blindly believe that "the peak season tide has passed" and are indifferent to this situation. For example, with floral gabardine, there were 26 colors in December last year, but this was reduced to 8 colors in January this year, and they still believe that "having some stock doesn't count as a stock-out."
    These commercial workers should open their eyes, look at the objective situation of the people's improved living standards, examine their conservative thinking, and immediately take effective measures to meet the needs of the masses.

    旺季已经过了吗
    中国花纱布公司济南市公司从去年第四季度起，就有人民最喜爱的花哔叽等10多种棉布脱销；甚至在当地能够加工生产的品种，也不能满足供应。群众很不满意。
    可是，这个公司的领导人员却盲目地认为“旺季大流已过”，对这种状况满不在乎。如花哔叽，去年12月份有26种花色，今年1月份曾经降到8种，他们还认为“有货不算脱销”。
    这些商业工作者，应该睁开眼睛，看看人民生活水平提高的客观形势，检查自己的保守思想；立即采取有效措施，满足群众的需要。
