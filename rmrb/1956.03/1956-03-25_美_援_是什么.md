U.S. "Aid"—What Is It?

　　According to figures published by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the United States' foreign "aid" totaled more than $51 billion in the ten years after World War II. Although the United States has used various pretexts and changed its "aid" implementation agencies many times when carrying out foreign "aid," it ultimately cannot conceal the fact that U.S. "aid" is a tool for the United States to carry out political, economic, and military expansion and prepare for new wars.

　　After the war, large-scale U.S. "aid" began with the "Aid" to Greece-Turkey Plan. In order to support the ruling classes of these two countries in suppressing domestic revolutions and democratic movements and to turn them into U.S. military bases in the Mediterranean, in March 1947, former President Truman, citing "U.S. security" as the reason, requested Congress to allocate $400 million to "aid" Greece and Turkey, and dispatched "U.S. civil and military officials" to "supervise the financial and material aid." This "aid" plan expired in 1950 and cost a total of $653 million. This is the origin of the "Truman Doctrine."

　　Because the aggressive nature of the "Truman Doctrine" was too obvious, it was condemned by the people of various countries. The United States adopted another approach, taking advantage of the economic difficulties of Western European countries after the war to extend its influence into these countries. This was the "Marshall Plan" passed by the U.S. Congress in April 1948 under the guise of "aiding European economic recovery" (this plan was proposed by former Secretary of State Marshall a year earlier). At that time, sixteen countries, including Britain and France, accepted the "Marshall Plan."

　　Under the guise of "loans" and "aid," the "Marshall Plan" exported surplus U.S. goods to recipient countries and became a tool for the United States to economically and politically enslave Western European countries. This aid plan stipulated that U.S. delegations should supervise the use of funds, the use of funds by various countries must be approved by the U.S. delegation, no goods that compete with the United States should be produced, 50% of U.S. "aid" goods should be transported by U.S. ships, the "aided" countries must supply the United States with various strategic materials, protect U.S. private investment and development rights, and separately conclude bilateral agreements with the United States. At the same time, it was also stipulated that U.S. "aid" should be used by the "Economic Cooperation Administration," the executive agency of the "Marshall Plan," and the director should be responsible for purchasing goods, including the U.S. government's inventory. Labor and technical assistance to "Marshallized countries" were also included in U.S. "aid."

　　What Western European countries needed at that time were tractors, fertilizers, and lathes to restore their national economies. However, the U.S. "aid" given to European countries for industrial development amounted to less than 6% of the total U.S. "aid." U.S. tobacco, milk powder, beverages, and inferior textiles, etc., filled the markets of Western European countries.

　　After the signing of the "North Atlantic Treaty" in August 1949, the "economic aid" of the "Marshall Plan" gradually retreated to an unimportant position, replaced by appropriations openly called for the preparation of war. In 1951, the total amount of "military aid" under the "Marshall Plan" increased more than twofold compared with the appropriation for "military aid" in 1950.

　　The "Marshall Plan" ended at the end of 1951, six months ahead of the original plan, and the Economic Cooperation Administration was abolished. The "Marshall Plan" cost approximately $12 billion. As a result, the economies of Western European countries became more chaotic, payment deficits continued to increase, and the long-term lack of U.S. dollars and the impoverishment of people's lives deepened.

　　During this period, the U.S. government proposed an "aid" plan for Asian, African, and Latin American countries in January 1949 under the pretext of "developing" backward areas. This plan was the fourth point of Truman's "Message to Congress on Combating Communism," so it was called the "Point Four Program." This is a new form of colonial enslavement through "aid."

　　The "Point Four Program" had no specific plan, and the funds for implementing the plan were decided by Congress year by year. This plan included two components: government "technical assistance" and private investment. Although the U.S. government touted this plan as using America's "scientific progress and industrial progress" to "improve and develop backward areas," the fact is that it expanded U.S. capital influence in backward areas, promoted surplus commodities, and plundered resources through "technical assistance." In July 1952, Truman, the founder of the "Point Four Program," openly admitted that this plan was "a very good deal" for the United States. "It means more trade, bigger markets... and more raw material supplies."

　　The main form of assistance under the "Point Four Program" was "technical assistance." According to the explanation of the U.S. foreign aid agency, it includes dispatching experts, training foreign technicians, and surveying resources. The "aided" countries not only have to spend a large sum of money to support them, but are also forced to provide detailed economic and resource information. Another "aid" method of the "Point Four Program" is "loans," but the "loans" given by the United States must be used to pay for goods purchased in the United States. According to the report of the "Foreign Operations Administration," from 1950 to June 1954, the United States gave a total of $600 million in "economic and technical assistance" to Far Eastern countries, of which 74.3% was the export of commodities from the United States, and agricultural products accounted for about 35% of the total.

　　When the United States provided assistance according to the "Point Four Program," it was attached to the requirements of political, economic, and military privileges, which seriously damaged the sovereignty and national independence principles of the "aided" countries. Therefore, it was criticized and rejected by countries that cherished their independence. Due to the notoriety of the "Point Four Program," Andrews, the head of the "Technical Cooperation Administration" responsible for implementing the "Point Four Program," said in June 1953 that the term "Point Four Program" would be stopped as much as possible in the future. The "Technical Cooperation Administration" was also abolished in August of the same year.

　　After the outbreak of the Korean War, the U.S. Congress passed the "Mutual Security Act" in October 1951 in the name of "common security," with the aim of strengthening arms expansion and war preparations and organizing aggressive military blocs through military, economic, and technical assistance to various countries. The bill stipulates that all countries accepting U.S. "aid" must undertake the military obligations in multilateral or bilateral treaties or agreements concluded with the United States, ensure the "most effective use" of U.S. economic and military "aid," and take "reasonable measures" to develop military forces.

　　After the "Mutual Security Act" was passed, the various U.S. foreign "aid plans" of the past were unified under the "Mutual Security Program." Truman said in a message to Congress in March 1952 that this plan "is a self-serving purpose" in order to "enable them (recipient countries) to realize our military and economic plans."

　　As a supplement to this bill, the "Battle Act" passed in October 1952 stipulates that all countries that want to receive military and economic "aid" from the United States should promulgate laws prohibiting the export of important strategic materials. At the same time, it also stipulates that the counterpart funds established by the "aided" countries from the sale of U.S. donated materials are only allowed to be used for important military and defense economic facilities. Therefore, from the time they concluded bilateral "agreements," the "aided" countries handed over the right to manage their resources, finances, and foreign trade to the United States.

　　The "aid" of the "Mutual Security Program" is mainly military in nature, and the so-called economic and technical assistance is also directly or indirectly used for military purposes.

　　In November 1951, the United States established the "Mutual Security Agency" to implement the "Mutual Security Program." However, because this "aid" also became notorious, the "Foreign Operations Administration" was established in August 1953 to replace the "Mutual Security Agency." In July 1955, the "International Cooperation Administration" was established to replace the "Foreign Operations Administration." These agencies mainly implement the so-called economic "aid." From this time on, "military aid" was executed by the U.S. Department of Defense.

　　After 1953, the United States gradually shifted its "aid" focus to Asia and Africa, and increased military "aid." In the foreign aid budget for 1956-57, direct military "aid" accounted for $3 billion out of the $4.86 billion appropriation, of which more than half will be used in Asia and Africa. In addition, a large amount of funds in the so-called "economic aid" is given to the "aided" countries for "defense support."

### 美“援”是什么

    美“援”是什么
    美国在二次大战后十年间的对外“援助”，据美国商务部发表的数字，共达510余亿美元。在进行对外“援助”时，尽管美国假借了各种名义，执行“援助”的机构也变换了多次，但终究掩盖不住这样一个事实：美“援”是美国作为对外进行政治、经济和军事扩张及准备新战争的工具。
    战后，美国大规模“援助”，是从“援助”希腊—土耳其计划开始的。为了支持这两个国家的统治阶级镇压国内革命和民主运动，并把它们变成美国在地中海的军事基地，1947年3月，前总统杜鲁门以“美国安全”为理由，要求国会拨款四亿美元“援助”希、土，并派遣“美国文武官员”“监督财政与物资的援助”。这项“援助”计划在1950年期满，共用去六亿五千三百万美元。这就是“杜鲁门主义”的由来。
    由于“杜鲁门主义”的侵略性质过于明显，遭到了各国人民的谴责，美国采取了另外一种方式，利用当时西欧国家战后经济困难把自己的势力伸入到这些国家，这就是美国国会在1948年4月，以“援助欧洲经济复兴”名义通过的“马歇尔计划”（这项计划是前国务卿马歇尔先一年提出的）。当时接受“马歇尔计划”的有英、法等十六个国家。
    “马歇尔计划”在“贷款”和“援助”的外衣下向受援国家输出美国过剩商品，并成为美国从经济上和政治上奴役西欧国家的工具。这项援助计划中规定：由美国派代表团监督拨款用途、各国用款须经美国代表团批准、不得生产与美国有竞争性的商品、美“援”货物50％由美船运输、受“援”国必须供给美国各种战略物资、保护美国私人投资和开发权利以及分别和美国缔结双边协定等。同时又规定“美援”由“马歇尔计划”执行机构“经济合作总署”署长负责采购商品，其中包括美国政府的存货。对“马歇尔化国家”的劳务和技术帮助等，也列在美“援”之内。
    西欧国家当时需要的是用以恢复国民经济的拖拉机、肥料和车床等。但给予欧洲国家发展工业的美“援”，总算起来还不到美“援”总数6％。而美国烟草、奶粉、饮料和劣等纺织品等却充满西欧国家的市场。
    1949年8月“北大西洋公约”签订后，“马歇尔计划”的“经济援助”逐渐退到不重要地位，代之以公开称为准备战争的拨款。1951年，“马歇尔计划”的“军事援助”总数比1950年“军事援助”的拨款增加了两倍多。
    “马歇尔计划”到1951年底比原计划提前六个月结束，经济合作总署撤销。“马歇尔计划”共用去约120亿美元。执行结果，西欧各国经济更加混乱，支付逆差不断增加，美元长期缺乏和人民生活的贫困加深。
    在此期间，美国政府以“开发”落后地区名义，在1949年1月提出一项对亚、非和拉丁美洲国家“援助”计划。这项计划是杜鲁门向国会提出“对共产主义作战咨文”的第四点，所以称为“第四点计划”。这是通过“援助”的形式来实现殖民奴役的新形式。
    “第四点计划”并无具体方案，实施计划的经费由国会逐年决定。这项计划包括两个组成部分：即政府的“技术援助”和私人的投资。尽管美国政府把这项计划宣扬为用美国的“科学的进步和工业的进步”来“改进和发展落后地区”，但事实是：通过“技术援助”在落后地区扩张美国资本势力、推销过剩商品和掠夺资源。1952年7月，“第四点计划”创始人杜鲁门公开承认说，这个计划对美国“是很好的买卖。……它意味着更多的贸易，更大的市场……以及更多的原料供应”。
    “第四点计划”主要援助方式是“技术援助”。按美国援外机构的解释，它包括派遣专家、训练外国技术人员和勘察资源等。受“援”国家不仅要支出一大笔费用供养他们，同时还被迫提供详细的经济和资源情报。“第四点计划”另一种“援助”方式是“贷款”，但是美国所给的“贷款”必须用来支付在美国购买的商品。据“援外事务管理署”的报告，从1950年到1954年6月，美国给予远东国家的“经济技术援助”共六亿美元，其中74.3％是从美国输出商品，而农产品约占总数35％。
    美国按照“第四点计划”进行援助时，附有政治、经济和军事特权的要求，严重地损害受“援”国家的主权和民族独立原则，因此受到珍视自己的独立的国家的抨击和拒绝。由于“第四点计划”声名狼籍，负责执行“第四点计划”的“技术合作总署”负责人安德路斯在1953年6月说，“第四点计划”这名词以后将尽可能停止使用。而“技术合作总署”也在同年八月撤销。
    朝鲜战争爆发后，美国国会又以“共同安全”为名，在1951年10月通过“共同安全法”，目的是在通过对各国的军事、经济和技术援助，加强扩军备战和组织侵略性的军事集团。法案规定，凡是接受美“援”的国家，必须承担与美国缔结多边或双边条约或协定中的军事义务，保证“最有效地利用”美国的经济和军事“援助”和采取发展军事力量的“合理措施”等。
    “共同安全法”通过以后，美国过去的各种对外“援助计划”都统一在“共同安全计划”之下进行。杜鲁门在1952年3月致国会咨文中说：这个计划“是利己的目的”，是为了“使它们（受援国）能够实现我们的军事和经济计划”。
    作为这个法案的补充，1952年10月通过的“巴特尔法”规定所有要从美国得到军事和经济“援助”的国家，应颁布禁止重要战略物资出口的法令。同时又规定受“援”国从变卖美国赠与物资所得的本国货币建立起来的对等基金，只准作为军事和国防经济重要设施的用途。因此，受“援”国从缔结双边“协定”时起，就把管理自己资源、财政和国外贸易的权利交给美国。
    “共同安全计划”的“援助”主要是军事性质的，所谓经济技术援助也直接或间接用于军事目的。
    1951年11月，美国成立了“共同安全署”来执行“共同安全计划”。但由于这项“援助”也弄得臭名远扬，1953年8月成立“援外事务管理署”来代替“共同安全署”。1955年7月又成立“国际合作署”来代替“援外事务管理署”。这些机构主要执行所谓经济性质的“援助”，从这个时候起，“军事援助”改由美国国防部负责执行。
    1953年以后，美国把“援助”重点逐渐转到亚非地区，并且加重军事“援助”。1956—57年度的援外预算，在48.6亿美元的拨款中，直接军事“援助”占30亿美元，其中一半以上将用于亚非地区。此外，在所谓“经济援助”中还有一笔较大的款项给受“援”国家作为“防御支持”的用途。
