Large New Coalfields Discovered Around Huainan Coal Mine

    Large coalfields have recently been discovered in the Mengcheng and Dingyuan areas surrounding the Huainan Coal Mine. In the coalfield east of Mengcheng, drilling to a depth of over 400 meters has revealed three exploitable coal seams. According to chemical analysis, the coal here is of good quality and suitable for use as coking coal blending. In the coalfield west of Dingyuan, coal seams were also discovered when drilling reached a depth of over 400 meters. In addition, thin coal seams have also been discovered in the Minglong Mountain area north of the Huainan Coal Mine.

    淮南煤矿外围发现大片新煤田
    淮南煤矿外围的蒙城和定远地区，最近发现大片煤田。蒙城以东的煤田，钻探到400多公尺深处，已经见到3层可采煤层。据化验证明，这里的煤质好，适合作炼焦配煤用。定远西面的煤田，在钻探到400多公尺时，也发现了煤层。此外，淮南煤矿以北的明龙山地区也发现了薄煤层。
