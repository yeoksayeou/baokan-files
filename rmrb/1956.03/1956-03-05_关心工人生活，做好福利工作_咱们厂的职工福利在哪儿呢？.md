Care for Workers' Lives, Do a Good Job in Welfare Work
“Where is the Welfare for Our Factory's Employees?”
To the Editor:
    The collective welfare facilities for employees of the Beijing State-Owned No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, such as the canteen, nursery, and club, have not been very effective in solving the difficulties of the employees. Therefore, the workers raise such questions: Where is the welfare for our factory's employees?
    More than 1,900 people, mostly single new workers with lower incomes, eat in the factory canteen regularly. However, the canteen is run very poorly, and the employees spend a lot of money but do not eat well. Although 60% of the employees eat grade C meals, the monthly food expenses still account for 30% to 33% of the average wage. Under the "semi-enterprise" management "principle," the canteen has not focused on careful calculation and waste reduction. Instead, it includes the depreciation costs of cooking utensils, tables, benches, and bicycles used by procurement personnel, as well as the salaries of canteen management personnel and cooks (who are administratively classified as non-production personnel) in the cost of food. Even the electricity bills for the union's use of the dining hall for theatrical performances, film screenings, and dance parties, and half of the food expenses for the 54 cooks, are borne by the employees who eat in the canteen. The factory's finance department collected 23,356 yuan from the canteen for these items alone last year. In addition, the canteen has to make a profit. From September 1954 to August 1955, the canteen had a total "surplus" of 8,035 yuan.
    The rent for employee dormitories and furniture has become a considerable burden for the employees. The charging standard for dormitory rent is unclear, and the salaries of the 15 staff members of the housing management group (administratively classified as non-production personnel) are also paid from the collected rent and welfare subsidies. Employees living in collective dormitories have to stay in the factory's guesthouse when their spouses visit on Saturdays, paying a rent of 40 cents per night. Family members and relatives who come to visit workers also have to pay for staying in the guesthouse, and the rent increases after more than a week.
    The factory is located outside the city. If employees and their families have urgent medical needs, the factory's cars are needed to take them to hospitals in the city for treatment. The factory administration also implements "enterprise management" in this regard, and the gasoline and car depreciation costs are borne by the passengers: sending a patient to Peking University Hospital costs 2.5 yuan if the patient is an employee, and 5 yuan if the patient is a family member. In the residential area with more than 3,000 employees and their families, only one telephone is installed. Even this only telephone is "enterprised." Employees are charged 2 cents per call, and family members are charged 4 cents.
    According to the regulations of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations, the establishment fees, equipment fees, and recurring expenses of the factory's nursery and kindergarten should be borne by the administration. However, they use the employee welfare fund and the inter-factory competition fund for this purpose. In other aspects, parents are required to pay more. As a result, many employees' children dare not be sent because they cannot afford the fees; many children who have already been sent in have to be taken back.
    In short, the collective welfare undertakings of this factory are just as the workers criticized: welfare is a sign, behind which grow several hands, asking us for money, money, money!
    Is it impossible for the welfare undertakings to be carried out if this factory does not ask the employees for more money everywhere? This is not the case at all. The labor productivity of this factory has been continuously improving in the past two years. In 1954, the planned production value per employee was 8,745 yuan, and the actual completion was 9,212 yuan; in the first, second, and third quarters of 1955, the planned production value per employee was 6,798 yuan, and the actual completion was 6,832 yuan. With the development of production, the state has allocated a total of 593,434.65 yuan to the factory in the past two years, according to the percentage of employees' wages, to improve the material and cultural life of the employees. However, so far, they have only spent 335,414.41 yuan, and a large amount of funds are still stockpiled. In particular, the enterprise bonus fund, totaling 186,525.86 yuan, has only spent 46,695 yuan, with a surplus of 139,830.86 yuan, accounting for 75%; the labor insurance fund controlled by the trade union also has a large surplus, accounting for 51% of the retained funds of the grassroots trade union. There are also serious misuses of the part that has been spent. For example, the administrative leaders of this factory are constantly shouting that the welfare subsidy is not enough, but in 1955, the factory's welfare subsidy used for subsidizing the expenses of low-value consumables reached 23,356.82 yuan; the medical subsidy totaled a surplus of 22,591.30 yuan, but it was rarely used to subsidize the expensive medicine expenses of employees. Why does this strange phenomenon occur? There can only be one explanation - the leading staff of the administration and trade union of this factory have forgotten the instruction that "while implementing the increase in production and thrift, we must pay attention to the safety, health, and indispensable welfare undertakings of the employees."

### 关心工人生活，做好福利工作  “咱们厂的职工福利在哪儿呢？”

    关心工人生活，做好福利工作
    “咱们厂的职工福利在哪儿呢？”编辑同志：
    北京国营第一棉纺织厂的食堂、托儿所、俱乐部等职工集体福利设施并没有很好地给职工解决困难，因此工人们提出这样的质问：咱们厂的职工福利在哪儿呢？
    这个厂的职工食堂经常有1，900多人吃饭，而且绝大多数是单身的收入较少的新工人。但是食堂办得很糟糕，职工花钱不少，吃的不好。虽然吃丙等菜的职工占60％，而工人每月花的伙食费还是占平均工资的30％到33％。食堂在“半企业化”的经营“原则”下，并没有从精打细算，减少浪费着手，而只是把炊事用具、桌子板凳以及采购人员用的自行车的折旧费等和属于行政的非生产人员编制的食堂管理人员、炊事人员的工资都计算到伙食成本里了，甚至工会借用饭厅演剧、放映电影、开跳舞晚会等用的电费和54个炊事人员的一半的伙食费用也由在食堂吃饭的职工负担。光是这些，厂方财务科去年就从食堂收回了23，356元。此外，食堂还要再赚一笔利润，从1954年9月到1955年8月，食堂共“盈余”了8，035元。
    这个厂的职工宿舍租金和家具租金等已经成为职工的一笔不轻的负担。宿舍租金收费标准不明确，连房屋管理组15个工作人员（属行政上的非生产人员编制）的工资也由收回来的房租和福利补助费里开支。住集体宿舍的职工，在爱人来过星期六的时候就得住到厂里的招待所去，一宿要付四角钱的房租。家属和亲戚来探望工人，住招待所也要收费，而且超过一个星期，租金还要递增。
    这个厂在城外，职工和职工家属有急病就需要厂里的汽车送他们到城里的医院诊治，工厂行政在这方面也实行“企业化”了，汽油、汽车折旧费都要由乘车的人来负担：送一个病人到北大医院，如果患病的是职工，收费2.5元；如果是职工家属，收费5元。在这个厂的3，000多人的职工和家属住宅区，只安了一部电话。连这唯一的电话也“企业化”了，职工每打一次电话收费2分，家属收费4分。
    按照劳动保险条例实施细则的规定，这个厂的托儿站和幼儿园所需的开办费、设备费和经常费用都应由行政方面负担，但是他们却把职工福利费和厂际竞赛基金用来作为这方面的开支；其他方面也处处要家长多出钱。因此有许多职工的孩子因为交不起费用，不敢送；有不少已经送进去的孩子，只好接回来。
    总之，这个厂的职工集体福利事业正像工人批评的那样：福利是一块招牌，它的背后长出了好几只手，向我们要钱，要钱，要钱！
    难道这个厂不这样处处向职工多要钱，福利事业就办不下去吗？完全不是这样。这个厂的劳动生产率两年来一直在不断地提高着。1954年，全年平均每一个职工计划生产价值为8，745元，实际完成是9，212元；1955年第一、二、三季度，平均每一个职工计划生产价值为6，798元，实际完成是6，832元。随着生产的发展，两年来国家按职工工资的百分比拨给这个厂用来改善职工的物质和文化生活的各项经费多达593，434.65元，但是到现在为止，他们只用去335，414.41元，剩下来的经费还大批积压着。特别是企业奖励基金，共有186，525.86元，只开支了46，695元，剩余139，830.86元，占75％；工会掌握的劳动保险基金剩余的也很多，占基层工会留用的51％。已经支出的这一部分，也有严重的使用不当的地方。例如，这个厂的行政领导工作人员整天叫喊福利补助金不够用，可是1955年这个厂的福利补助金用于补助低值易耗品开支的达23，356.82元；医药补助费共剩余22，591.30元，但是很少用于补助职工的贵重药品开支。为什么会发生这种怪现象呢？只能有一个解释——这个厂的行政和工会等的领导工作人员忘记了“在实施增产节约的同时，必须注意职工的安全、健康和必不可少的福利事业”这个指示。    苏克
