Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, March 22nd. The Mandalay "People's Daily" published an editorial on March 21st criticizing the British authorities in Hong Kong for illegally releasing Nationalist (Kuomintang) fighter plane personnel who had fled to Hong Kong back to Taiwan.

The editorial said that the British attitude in taking this action "is an unfriendly attitude towards New China and an attitude of helping the wicked."

The editorial pointed out that there is nothing more illegal than allowing the Kuomintang to use Hong Kong in actions that threaten the security of New China.

The editorial said that the British authorities should take a long-term view and improve relations with New China in all aspects. The editorial pointed out, "If you want to treat New China with conspiracies and tricks, it will not be New China but Britain itself that will suffer the losses."

    缅报抨击英当局释放蒋机人员
    新华社仰光22日电　曼德勒“人民报”3月21日发表社论抨击香港英国当局非法把逃避到香港的国民党战斗机机上人员放回台湾。
    社论说，英国采取这一行动的态度“是对新中国不友好的态度，是助纣为虐的态度”。
    社论指出，没有比容许国民党在威胁新中国安全的行动中利用香港这种行动更加非法的了。
    社论说，英国当局应当以远大的眼光从各方面来搞好同新中国的关系。社论指出，“如果想以阴谋诡计对待新中国的话，遭到损失的将不是新中国而是英国自己”。
