    To the Editor:
    We often receive files with the same content from various levels of leadership organs. For example, the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Finance, and the State Council Personnel Bureau jointly issued a "Joint Notice on Handling Several Issues Regarding Stipends for Cadre Students and Industrial Worker Students" on January 28, 1955. The Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Shandong Provincial People's Committee then separately copied and sent this notice to our school on January 14 and 27, 1956, respectively. Another example is the notice "Request for Assistance in Recommending and Subscribing to the Chinese Edition of 'Knowledge is Power' Monthly" sent by the Ministry of Labor and the China Association for Science and Technology on January 6. Shortly after, the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Zibo City Labor Bureau also copied and sent it to our school via official letters. Such documents only need to be issued by one appropriate organ. This practice of repeated copying and distribution is completely unnecessary. We hope that relevant leading organs will pay attention to avoiding this situation in their document issuance work.

    内容重复的文件编辑同志：
    我们经常收到由各级领导机关发来的同样内容的文件。例如，高等教育部、教育部、财政部、国务院人事局在1955年1月28日下达了“关于改进调干学生及产业工人学生人民助学金几个问题的处理办法”的联合通知，重工业部和山东省人民委员会又分别在1956年1月14日和27日分别把这个通知抄发我校。又如，劳动部和中华全国科学技术普及协会在1月6日发来为“请协助推荐和征订‘知识即力量’中国版月刊”的通知，不久，重工业部和淄博市劳动局又都以公函抄致我校。这样的文件，只要有一个适当的机关下达就可以了，这种重复抄发的做法是完全没有必要的。希望有关领导机关在发公文的工作中注意避免这种情况。
