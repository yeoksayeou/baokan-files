    Beijing's third group of 1,300 migrants heading to the Yinchuan Special District in Gansu Province to participate in agricultural production this year departed on the 24th. The first two groups, totaling more than 2,600 people, have successively arrived in the Yinchuan Special District, and some have already been properly settled. The majority of these migrants are peddlers, pedicab workers, and unemployed individuals, etc. They all recognize that participating in agricultural production is glorious. Liu Yutai, a pedicab worker from the Dongdan District, wearing a new blue serge suit and a big red flower on his chest, said happily, "This time I am going to participate in agricultural production, I finally have a promising future!"
    Last year, more than 8,500 migrants from Beijing moved to the Yinchuan Special District of Gansu Province and Xining and other counties of Qinghai Province. They all joined agricultural production cooperatives, and their lives and production have been well arranged. Many people have written letters expressing their gratitude to the government for taking care of them, and some have also written to their relatives and friends, urging them to participate in agricultural production as soon as possible. In order to meet the needs of the masses, Beijing plans to migrate more than 26,000 people this year to participate in agricultural production.

    北京市第三批移民出发
    北京市今年第三批前往甘肃省银川专区参加农业生产的一千三百多移民，已在二十四日出发。前两批二千六百多人已陆续到达银川专区，有的已经得到妥善安置。这些移民大部分是摊贩、三轮车工人、失业人员等，他们都认识到参加农业生产是光荣的。东单区三轮车工人刘玉泰穿着一身新蓝斜纹衣服，胸前带着大红花，他高兴地说：“这次去参加农业生产，前途可有了奔头啦”！
    去年北京市迁往甘肃省银川专区和青海省西宁等县的移民有八千五百多人，他们都参加了农业生产合作社，生活、生产都得到很好安排，有许多人写信表示感谢政府对他们的照顾，有的还写信给他们的亲戚朋友劝他们赶快参加农业生产。为了适应群众的要求，北京市计划今年移民二万六千多人去参加农业生产。
