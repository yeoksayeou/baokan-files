How Jinxing Cooperative Employs Female Labor
　　Yang Shubei Chen Jie
　　The Jinxing Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Cooperative in Xigou Township, Ping順 County, Shanxi Province, achieved an all-round bumper harvest last year. The total income of the cooperative from agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations was equivalent to 1,059,906 jin of grain, with an average of 1,086 jin per person, more than double the average of 540 jin per person in 1951. The most important reason for achieving such results is the development of diversified economy. Developing diversified economy requires more labor, which is inseparable from mobilizing women to participate in production.

　　Of the 238 female laborers in the cooperative, except for 21 who were pregnant or ill, the rest regularly participated in production. In 1955, they worked a total of 9,867 labor days, accounting for 22.1% of the total labor days in the cooperative.

　　In 1955, the women of the cooperative independently harrowed 225 mu of land, and all 140 mu of wheat fields were weeded by women. Women completed more than 80% of the seedling pulling work for the cooperative's 763 mu of corn and 436 mu of millet. Corn fertilization, artificial pollination, threshing, etc., were also basically undertaken by women. In addition, women accumulated no less than 25,000 dan of various fertilizers, afforested (sowed) 200 mu, planted 2,500 trees, raised 137 pigs, and raised 1,680 chickens.

　　Shen Jilan, the deputy director of the Jinxing Cooperative, often inspired the female members to "think about the difficulties suffered in the past, compare the current abundance of food and clothing, and look forward to a happy and fulfilling future," encouraging their enthusiasm for participating in production. Many female members have realized: "In the past, if we didn't produce, men looked down on us; now we go up the mountains, men and women are equal." They learned that after the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, and after completing the cooperative's 15-year plan, each person would receive an income equivalent to 7,100 jin of grain per year. At that time, it would truly be "endless food, endless clothing, and a free and happy life without poverty." They also knew that this beautiful vision must rely on our own hands to build. They unanimously proposed: "Socialism is good, but you can't wait for it; if you want to enjoy happiness, everyone must be diligent." They closely combined the interests of individuals and the collective, and the collective and the state, shifting from the simple view of earning labor days to consciously building their own collective new life. The women excitedly and happily completed the sowing of 200 mu of "Socialist Construction Forest." Raising pigs is a job suitable for women. However, initially some women were ideologically blocked, looked down on this work, and thought it was not as glorious as working in the fields. Shen Jilan used the example of model pig raising to educate everyone; as a result, the number of pigs raised exceeded any previous year.

　　In the overall production plan, the scope of production was expanded, paving a broad road for more women to participate in production. Which jobs should women do? In the spirit of making the best use of everyone's talents, the Jinxing Cooperative carried out specific division of labor and industries, and made labor plans for full and semi-labor women on a quarterly basis. In the spring, young and middle-aged women have 16 kinds of work such as spreading manure, repairing side dikes, harrowing land, sowing seeds, leading livestock, weeding wheat, etc., and elderly women have 4 kinds of work such as cutting turnips, selecting seeds, etc. In the summer, the main tasks for women are pulling seedlings, weeding, weeding, catching insects, corn fertilization, artificial pollination, harvesting wheat, threshing, etc. There are 16 kinds of farm work for women in the autumn, such as cutting grain, digging turnips, and breaking corn. Women participated in a total of 47 kinds of agricultural work, accounting for 43% of the 108 kinds of agricultural work throughout the year. Forestry, animal husbandry and sideline work were also properly arranged season by season. This eliminated the past waste of time and labor when women had nothing to do. In 1955, more and more women participated in production. Wang Zhaogen, a 64-year-old woman, worked 93 labor days in one year. She said happily: "The cooperative is evergreen in winter and summer, and old men and women have a livelihood. Old people in their 80s become young people, and a happy life is guaranteed."

　　Enabling women to master production technology is an important guarantee for giving full play to women's labor potential and developing diversified economy. Female members felt that the biggest difficulty in participating in production was the lack of production technology. Shen Jilan grasped this fundamental demand of women and tried her best to help them learn technology. They invited male members with good skills to be teachers, "men do a sample, women follow," and eight female members including Zhang Laxiu participated in agricultural technology training classes held in the county. They also used a certain amount of time to learn technology in the civil schools. In addition to rocking the seed drill, 80% of young and middle-aged women have become almost "all-rounders." Technical competitions were launched among female members; each season was evaluated and summarized, and learning technology was one of the main contents of the evaluation. In 1955, in addition to improving their skills in agriculture, women also learned various sowing methods for mountain forests, some women learned how to graft apple trees, and also learned how to inject pigs and chickens. Male members said: "I used to think: if men smoke one less bag of cigarettes, it would be enough for women to do it for a day. Now I see: with the comprehensive development of construction, it is difficult to achieve without women."

　　The Jinxing Cooperative paid great attention to resolving the contradiction between women's participation in production and managing housework. In 1955, five seasonal childcare groups were organized, enabling 37 women with children to participate in production, and the labor utilization rate of women with children increased by more than 40% compared with 1954. Some members lived scattered and it was inconvenient to organize childcare groups, so the elderly mothers were allowed to cook and take care of the children at home, and young women went to work in the fields. Although Ma Junzhao's family had two children, she still worked more than 60 labor days a year. For women who had too many things at home and could not go to the fields, the cooperative organized them to raise pigs and chickens. For example, Zhang Wangxing's daughter-in-law had eye problems and had a lot of things to do at home, so the cooperative assigned her to raise two pigs, which gave her an income equivalent to more than 1,000 jin of grain.

　　They advocate that men and women help each other, unite and love each other, run the cooperative well, and live a good life. Zhang Jucai, the secretary of the Youth League Branch, and his wife went to the fields together. After returning home, the man burned the fire, the woman made noodles, the man fed the pigs, and the woman looked after the children; when it was cloudy and rainy and they could not go to the fields, the man helped the woman cook, and the woman did needlework. How happy and blissful they are!

    金星合作社怎样运用妇女劳动力
    杨树培　陈杰
    山西省平顺县西沟乡金星农林牧合作社去年获得了全面大丰收。全社农业林业牧业和副业收入总值折合粮食1，059，906斤，全社每人平均1，086斤，超过1951年每人平均540斤的一倍。能够取得这样的成绩，最重要的一个原因是发展了多种经济。发展多种经济就需要比较多的劳动力，这同发动妇女参加生产是分不开的。
    全社238个妇女劳动力，除了21个生孩子和害病以外，其余的都经常地参加了生产。1955年，她们共做了9，867个劳动日，占全社总劳动日数的22.1％。
    1955年，全社妇女单独耙地225亩，麦田140亩全部是妇女锄的。全社763亩玉米和436亩谷地的拔苗工作，80％以上是妇女完成的。玉米灌心、人工授粉、扬场等等，基本上也都是由妇女担任。此外，妇女积各种肥料不下25，000担，造林（播种）200亩，植树2，500株，喂猪137口，养鸡1，680只。
    金星社的副主任申纪兰，经常启发女社员“想过去受尽困难，比现在吃穿有余，望将来幸福美满”，鼓舞她们参加生产的积极性。许多女社员都认识到了：“过去不生产，男人小视咱；现在上高山，男女都一般。”她们了解到：农、林、牧全面发展以后，完成了社里的15年计划，每人每年将要得到的收入合粮食7，100斤。那时候，真是“吃不完，穿不尽，自由幸福没穷人”。她们也知道了：这个美好的远景，必须依靠咱们的双手来建设。她们一致提出：“社会主义好，坐着等不到，要想享幸福，大家要勤劳。”她们把个人和集体、集体和国家的利益，密切地结合了起来，由单纯赚劳动日的观点转向了自觉地建设自己的集体的新生活。妇女们兴奋愉快地完成了200亩“社会主义建设林”的播种工作。喂猪是适合妇女做的活。但是，最初有的妇女思想不通，看不起这种工作，认为没有下地光荣。申纪兰就用喂猪模范的事例教育大家；结果是喂猪数超过了过去任何一年。
    在全面的生产规划中，扩大了生产范围，给更多的妇女参加生产开辟了广阔的道路。究竟那些活应该是妇女做的呢？金星社本着人尽其才的精神，进行了具体的分工分业，把妇女中全劳动力和半劳动力都按季度进行了劳动规划。在春季，青壮年妇女有撒粪、修理边堰、耙耢土地、点种、牵牲口、锄麦子等等16种工作，老年妇女有切蔓菁、选种籽等等4种工作。夏季，妇女的主要工作是拔苗、锄苗、除草、捉虫、玉米灌心、人工授粉、收麦、打场等11种。秋季，妇女有割谷、刨蔓菁、掰玉米等16种农活。全年妇女共参加大小农活47种，占全年108种农活的43％。林业牧业副业工作也一季一季做了适当的安排。这样，就消除了过去妇女没事干的窝工浪费现象。1955年，参加生产的妇女越来越多。64岁的王招根老太太，一年就做了93个劳动日。她高兴地说：“合作社是冬夏常青，老汉老婆有了营生，80岁老人变成后生，幸福的生活有了保证。”
    使妇女掌握生产技术，是发挥妇女劳动潜力、发展多种经济的重要保证。女社员感到参加生产的最大困难就是缺乏生产技术。申纪兰抓住了妇女的这一个根本要求，尽力帮助她们学习技术。她们请技术好的男社员做老师，“男人做出样，妇女照着上”；并且有张腊秀等八个女社员参加了县里举办的农业技术训练班。她们在民校也利用一定时间学习技术。有80％的青壮年妇女，除了摇耧以外，几乎成了“全把式”。在女社员中间，开展了技术竞赛；每季评比总结，学习技术是评比的主要内容之一。1955年，妇女除了在农业上提高了技术以外，也学习了山林的各种播种方法，一部分妇女学会了嫁接苹果树，还学会了给猪、鸡打针。男社员们说：“以前想：男人少吸一袋烟，顶住女人做一天。现在看：全面建设大开展，离了妇女难实现。”
    金星社十分注意解决妇女参加生产和管理家务的矛盾。1955年，组织了5个季节托儿组，使37个有小孩的妇女都参加了生产，比1954年有小孩的妇女的劳动利用率提高了40％以上。一部分社员住的分散，不便组织托儿组，就让年老的妈妈在家做饭、看孩子，青年妇女上地劳动。马俊招家虽有两个孩子，一年还做了60多个劳动日。家里事情太多不能下地的妇女，社里组织她们喂猪、养鸡。如张旺兴媳妇的眼有毛病，家庭事情也多，社里就分配她喂了两口猪，使她得到了等于1，000多斤粮食的收入。
    他们提倡男女互相帮助，团结友爱，把社办好，把日子过好。青年团支部书记张聚才，小俩口一齐上地，回家后男的烧火，女的赶面，男的喂猪，女的看孩子；天阴下雨，不能上地，男的帮助女的做饭，让女的做针线。他们是多么愉快幸福！
