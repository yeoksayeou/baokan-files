Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, 20th: The Finnish Trade Union Central Federation and the Finnish Employers' Central Federation reached an agreement on the evening of the 19th, deciding to end the national general strike starting from the 20th. The agreement stipulates that workers' wages will increase by ten to twelve marks per hour. The workers originally demanded a wage increase of twelve marks per hour.

This strike was the largest in Finland since 1917. The strike began on March 1st and lasted for twenty days. During this period, Finnish industry and transportation came to a near standstill. According to Finnish economic experts, due to the impact of the strike, the industrial production sector alone suffered losses of approximately 48 billion marks.

In this strike, Finnish workers demonstrated unity and a tenacious fighting spirit, thwarting various attempts by employers to undermine the strike, and finally forcing them to agree to the workers' demands.

    芬兰总罢工胜利结束
    新华社20日讯　　赫尔辛基消息：芬兰工会中央联合会同芬兰企业主中央联合会十九日晚间达成协议，决定从二十日起停止全国总罢工。协议规定工人工资每小时增加十到十二马克。工人原来是要求每小时增加工资十二马克。
    这次罢工是芬兰从1917年以来最大的一次罢工。罢工是在三月一日开始的，坚持了二十天之久。在这期间，芬兰工业和交通运输几乎完全停顿。据芬兰经济专家估计，由于罢工的影响，仅工业生产部门就遭到约四百八十亿马克的损失。
    芬兰工人在这次罢工中表现了团结一致和顽强的斗争精神，粉碎了企业主破坏罢工的各种企图，终于迫使他们不得不答应工人的要求。
