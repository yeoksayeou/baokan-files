Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 9th. Twelve youth representatives from the five provinces (autonomous region) of the Loess Plateau reported their achievements in afforestation, soil and water conservation, etc., to the Five Provinces (Autonomous Region) Youth Afforestation Conference today, and respectively proposed their future goals. Youth representative Zhao Deng'ao from the army proposed five guarantees for all military youth to participate in greening the motherland at the meeting. Beijing youth representative Wang Qinggong reported on Beijing youth's plan to green the great capital of the motherland.

Wang Rongbi, a representative from Shaanxi Province, introduced the new look of his hometown, Zhaoshipan Township, Hengshan County, after afforestation. Zhaoshipan Township is located on both sides of the Lu River. In the past, due to the lack of trees, the shifting sand continued to move south, and the cultivated land was often affected by sandstorms, and many fertile fields became sand dunes. Since 1952, the township has vigorously afforested, planting more than 29,000 mu of trees, sowing 2,500 mu of caragana, and planting 50,000 trees sporadically. These trees have effectively controlled the shifting sand, maintained soil and water, prevented the yellow sand north of the Lu River from moving forward, and greatly reduced the damage of sandstorms. In 1955, Zhaoshipan Township suffered a major drought unseen for many years, but agricultural output still increased by 12% compared with 1952.

Hou Tingbao, secretary of the Youth League branch of Zhangjiaying Township, Ying County, Shanxi Province, introduced the situation of the youth in Zhangjiaying Township greening Huanghualing, where soil erosion was serious. Since 1954, the township has been carrying out afforestation and soil and water conservation work. Small forests and soil and water conservation projects have appeared on the bare Huanghualing. The land output of the three agricultural producers' cooperatives in the village has increased by 28% compared with the past, and more than 20 new houses have been built in the village.

Tao Ke, director of the Suide Soil and Water Conservation Station in Shaanxi Province, introduced to the representatives how the Suide area carries out soil and water conservation work in the loess hilly area. Jiuyuangou, Suide County, began large-scale soil and water conservation work in 1953. In 1954, it controlled 97% of the sediment from leaving the gully, and in 1955, it controlled all the sediment. Due to sufficient water storage, the water fields outside the gully expanded from more than 30 mu to more than 800 mu. This year, after rational allocation of water, it can be expanded to more than 1,100 mu.

Zhang Xiangye from Zhangjiaping Village, Suide County, Shaanxi Province, was warmly welcomed by the audience when he spoke at the conference. Zhang Xiangye's left hand was disabled by the Hu Zongnan bandit army in 1947, but he was encouraged by the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League to convene the Five Provinces (Autonomous Region) Youth Afforestation Conference in Yan'an. Alone, he completed the guarantee of planting 1,600 trees last winter.

Liu Fquan, a representative from Shanxi Province, reported on the exemplary deeds of the youth forest protection team in Nangou Village, Duanbao Township, Xiangyuan County, in protecting 3,000 mu of forest. Wen Jinzhong of the Youth League Committee of Helan County, Gansu Province, reported on the experience of the Youth League leading the youth of the county to plant trees and make forests. The Helan County Committee of the Communist Youth League criticized conservative ideas and let go of mobilizing and organizing the vast number of young people to plant trees and make forests. As a result, it completed the task scheduled to be completed in three years in one day, and built a Yellow River bank protection forest with a total length of more than 30 li and an average width of 1 zhang and 5 chi. In addition, it also built four mu of "Youth Forest".

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 9th. Representatives of the Five Provinces (Autonomous Region) Youth Afforestation Conference and Yan'an youth held a grand get-together of more than 5,000 people today. Young people from more than a dozen ethnic groups in 27 provinces (autonomous regions) and cities spent an afternoon full of friendship and joy in a large square near the original Wenhua Gou and across the Yanhe River from Wangjiaping. Thousands of Yan'an people also gathered on the nearby hills to watch this unprecedented event in nearly 10 years.

The get-together began with performances of Shaanbei Yangko and Northeast folk dances, Mongolian, Tibetan, and Uyghur dances, Peking Opera, and local folk tunes on the square. Then, the representatives danced with the youth of Yan'an. Finally, the crowd gathered in front of the rostrum to enjoy the storytelling of Han Qixiang, a folk artist from northern Shaanxi, and the songs and dances of the Yan'an Song and Dance Troupe.

    五省（区）青年造林大会开始大会发言
    代表们和延安青年举行盛大联欢
    新华社延安9日电　来自黄土高原的五省（区）的12位青年代表，今天向五省（区）青年造林大会汇报了他们在植树造林、水土保持等方面的成绩，分别提出了今后的奋斗目标。部队青年代表赵登鳌在会上提出了全军青年参加绿化祖国的5条保证，北京市青年代表王庆功报告了北京青年绿化伟大祖国首都的规划。
    陕西省代表王荣碧，介绍了他的家乡横山县赵石畔乡绿化后的新面貌。赵石畔乡位于芦河的两岸，过去因为林木缺少，流沙不断南移，耕地常常受风沙的灾害，许多良田都变成了沙丘。全乡自从1952年大力造林以后，现在已造林29，000多亩，播种柠条2，500亩，还零星植树5万株。这些林木有力地控制住流沙，保持了水土，使芦河以北的黄沙再也不能向前推移，大大地减少风沙的灾害。1955年赵石畔乡遭受了多年未有的大旱灾，可是农业产量还比1952年增加12％。
    山西省应县张家营乡青年团支部书记侯廷保，在会上介绍了张家营乡青年绿化水土流失严重的黄花岭的情况。这个乡自从1954年开始进行植树造林和水土保持工作、在光秃秃的黄花岭上出现了一片一片的小树林和满山遍野的水土保持工程，全村3个农业生产合作社的土地产量比过去提高了28％，村里也盖起了20多间新房子。
    陕西省绥德水土保持工作站站长陶克，向代表们介绍了绥德专区是怎样在黄土丘陵区进行水土保持工作的。绥德县韭园沟在1953年开始大规模地进行了水土保持工作，在1954年就作到控制97％的泥沙不出沟，1955年就控制了全部泥沙，并且由于充分蓄水，使沟口外的水地从30多亩扩大到800多亩。今年合理调剂用水后，还可以扩大到1，100多亩。
    陕西省绥德县张家坪村的张向业在大会发言时，受到了全场的热烈欢迎。张向业的左手在1947年被胡宗南匪军炸成了残废，但他在青年团中央决定在延安召开五省（区）青年造林大会的决定的鼓舞下，一个人在去年冬季就完成了栽树1，600棵的保证。
    山西省代表刘富全报告了襄垣县段堡乡南沟村青年护林组保护3，000亩森林的模范事迹。青年团甘肃省贺兰县委员会的汶进中报告了青年团领导全县青年植树造林的经验。青年团贺兰县委由于批判了保守思想，放手发动和组织广大青年植树造林，结果在一天当中完成了预定在三年内完成的任务，营造了一条全长30多里、平均宽1丈5尺的黄河护岸林，另外还造了四亩“青年林”。
    据新华社延安9日电　五省（区）青年造林大会代表同延安青年一起，今天举行了5，000多人的盛大联欢。来自27个省（区）、市十多个民族的青年们，在原文化沟附近、和延河北岸的王家坪遥遥相对的一片大广场上，度过了一个充满友谊和欢乐的下午。上千的延安人也聚集在附近的山坡上，来观看这种近10年来所没有的盛况。
    联欢开始了，在广场上表演的有陕北大秧歌和东北民间舞，有蒙古族、藏族和维吾尔族的舞蹈，有京剧和各地的民间曲调。接着，代表们同延安的青年在一起跳起舞来了。最后人群又聚集在主席台前，欣赏了陕北民间艺人韩起祥的说书和延安歌舞团的歌舞等节目。
