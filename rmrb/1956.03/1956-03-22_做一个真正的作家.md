    Being a True Writer
    Jun Qing
    In the history of our country, literature has never played such a significant social role for the people as it does today. The people have never loved and respected writers as much as they do now. The meticulous care and encouragement from the Party and the government are also unprecedented. How can we repay the great love of the people for us? How can we repay the care and encouragement of the Party and the government? This is a question that every literary worker should constantly ponder.
    It should be said that truly becoming a writer in name and in fact is by no means a casual matter. Literary creation is mental labor, which depends not only on the writer's artistic skills and life experience but also on the writer's political quality. "Engineers of the human soul" is a glorious title, and writers must be worthy of this glorious title in all their words and deeds.
    The times demand that a writer must be an advanced element of our era. His ideals, his work, and even his private life should become examples for people. People imitate them, follow them, and struggle against all bad tendencies. Therefore, he must be a person who is highly responsible to the country and society. At any time and in any place, all his actions must be able to withstand strict scrutiny.
    In our great country, writers should not and are not allowed to be people with double personalities. We simply cannot imagine how a petty bourgeois with serious individualism and selfishness can write works with clear socialist ideas that encourage people to generously contribute everything they have for the country and the collective. We cannot even imagine how a person who is extremely degenerate and morally depraved can educate and influence our younger generation with noble communist morality in his works.
    This is impossible, completely impossible.
    However, regrettably, we must feel ashamed that in our literary ranks, even now, there are still some people who are completely unworthy of the glorious title of writer. Some people, on the surface, seem to be engaged in creative labor, but in the depths of their minds, they do not regard literary creation as a cause of the class but as a ladder to obtain personal fame and wealth. What they dream of is not how to carefully and diligently write works with great educational significance for the people but are very enthusiastic about honors and money. There is a great deal of speculation in the behavior of such people. They are unwilling to engage in creative labor earnestly and seriously but try to find shortcuts in the path of literature, watching the trends, catching up with the market, grabbing a bit here and there, and some simply engage in despicable plagiarism and theft. Cultural brokers like Miao Peishi are not unique in our ranks. There are also some people who, after writing one or two books and having a little money, no longer engage in arduous creative labor but waste a lot of valuable time in antique shops, dances, and theaters, pursuing the enjoyment of life. Political enthusiasm diminishes day by day, and interest in the surrounding boiling life fades day by day. Some people even completely fall into the mire of corruption and degeneration, morally corrupt, violating laws and disciplines, insulting women, and, in order to achieve his evil purposes, he even did more terrible scandals than Kong Jue. Such people not only tarnish the glorious title of writer but also smear our team with a layer of black ash, which is really heartbreaking. Why do such shameless scoundrels, who are spurned by people, often appear in our glorious and noble team?
    People respect writers because writers can influence them in their works and their actions and guide them to a state where their souls are more noble and more beautiful. But some people are not aware of their responsibilities at all. He betrayed the people with his ugly and dirty behavior and failed the people's expectations. In recent years, the number of people who have been removed from our team due to various scandals is not just one or two. From the perspective of our team, removing a morally corrupt bad element will only make our team more pure and more consolidated, but from the perspective of our entire literary undertaking, shouldn't we hope that these kinds of things happen as little as possible? Shouldn't we hope that all members of our team can keep up with the pace of the times and move forward together?
    Today, in the enthusiastic atmosphere where all working people are engaged in socialist construction, talking about such things seems a bit uncoordinated and unpleasant. However, how can a sense of responsibility to the country and the people allow us to turn a blind eye to these even extremely individual phenomena?
    We have a responsibility to fiercely lash out at and seriously deal with those dregs who are no longer worthy of continuing to muddle along in our ranks, because taking any forgiveness and indulgence on such issues will only cause inestimable losses to our cause. We have a greater responsibility to encourage all comrades to strive to improve their ideological cultivation, work hard, and be true writers who live up to the expectations of this great era and the people.

    做一个真正的作家
    峻青
    在我国历史上，文学对于人民从来没有像现在这样发挥着巨大的社会作用。人民对于作家也从来没有像现在这样热爱和尊重。党和政府对于我们的无微不至的关怀和鼓励，更是史无前例的。用什么来回答广大人民对我们的热爱？用什么来回答党和政府对于我们的关怀和鼓励？这不能不是我们每一个文学工作者所时刻都应该深思的问题。
    应该说：真正成为名符其实的作家，却决不是什么随便的事情。文学创作是精神的劳动，它不仅决定于作家的艺术技巧和生活经验，而且还决定于作家的政治品质。人类灵魂工程师是光荣的称号，作家必须在一切言行上都能够同这光荣的称号相称。
    时代要求我们：作为一个作家，他必须是我们这个时代的先进分子。他的理想，他的工作，以至他的私人生活，都应该成为人们的范例。人们摹仿他们，追随他们，与一切恶劣倾向进行斗争。因此，他必须是一个对国家和社会高度负责的人，在任何时候，任何地方，他的一切作为都必须经得起严格的检查。
    在我们这个伟大的国家里，作家不应该也不允许是两重人格的人。我们简直不能想像：一个有着严重的个人主义的自私自利的市侩，他怎么能够写出那种具有鲜明的社会主义思想的鼓舞着人们为了国家为了集体而慷慨地贡献出自己的一切的作品？我们更不能想像：一个在道德品质上极端堕落下流的分子，他怎么能够在自己的作品中给我们的年青一代以高尚的共产主义道德品质的教育和影响。
    这是不可能的，完全不可能。
    然而，遗憾的是，我们不能不引以为耻的，在我们的文学队伍中，直到现在，还有这样或那样的一些和作家这个光荣称号完全不相称的人物。有的人在表面上看起来，似乎也是在进行着创作劳动，但是在他的思想深处，却并不是把文学创作看作是阶级的事业，而是看成了获取个人名利的阶梯。他梦寐以求的并不是如何精心尽力地为人民写出有着巨大教育意义的作品，而是十分热衷于荣誉和金钱。在这种人的行为中，有着很大的投机成份，他不肯真正刻苦地严肃地从事创作劳动，而企图在文学的道路上寻找捷径，看风头，赶行情，东捞一把，西摸一把，有的干脆就进行卑鄙的抄袭盗窃活动。像苗培时式的文化掮客，在我们的队伍中并不是绝无仅有。还有的人，写出了一本和两本书，有了一点钱，就不再从事艰苦的创作劳动了，把许多宝贵的时间，虚掷在古玩店、舞会、剧院中，一味追求生活的享受。政治热情一天天地消失，对周围的沸腾的生活一天天地缺乏兴趣。有的人甚至完全掉进了腐化堕落的泥坑，道德败坏，违法乱纪，侮辱妇女，为了达到他的罪恶的目的，他居然干出比孔厥还要恶劣的骇人听闻的丑事。这样的人，不仅沾污了作家的这一光荣称号，而且给我们的队伍，抹上了一层黑灰，这真是令人痛心的事情，为什么在我们的这个光荣而高尚的队伍里面，常会出现这么一些为人所不齿的无耻之徒呢？
    人们尊重作家，是因为作家能够在自己的作品中和自己的行动上，影响他们，把他们引导到一个使自己的灵魂更加高尚更加美好的境地。可是有些人却丝毫不意识到自己的责任。他用自己的丑恶而肮脏的行为背叛了人民，辜负了人民的期望。几年来，由于种种丑行而被清除出我们队伍的人，已经不是一个和两个了。从我们的队伍来说，清除一个道德败坏的坏分子，只有使我们的队伍更加纯洁和更加巩固，但是从我们整个的文学事业来说，难道我们不应该希望着这类的事情发生的越少越好吗？难道不应该希望着我们这个队伍里的所有的成员都能够紧紧地跟上时代的步伐一起前进吗？
    在今天，在所有劳动人民都在热火朝天的进行着社会主义建设的热烈气氛中，谈起这类事情来似乎是不太协调的，也是令人不愉快的。可是，对于国家和对于人民的责任感，怎么能够容许我们对这些即使是极其个别的现象，熟视无睹呢？
    我们有责任对那些已经不配在我们的队伍里继续混下去的败类进行猛烈的鞭挞和严肃的处理，因为对于这类问题采取任何宽恕和纵容，都只有使我们的事业蒙受无可估计的损失。我们更有责任，来勉励所有的战友，努力提高自己的思想修养，刻苦地劳动，作一个真正的不辜负这个伟大的时代和人民的期望的作家。
