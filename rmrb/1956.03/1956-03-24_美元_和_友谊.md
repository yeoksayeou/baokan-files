　　The American government allocates only three to four hundred million dollars to education each year. Compared to this expenditure, twenty-eight hundred million dollars is a considerable sum. According to "U.S. News & World Report" magazine, this is the total amount of "aid" the United States has given to Greece in the past decade. The magazine pointed out that the money the United States has poured into Greece in military and economic aid amounts to more than 340 dollars per person, more than it has poured into any other country in the world.

　　This publication, which is accustomed to discussing American domestic and foreign policy from a purely business perspective, raised the question: "How much friendship has the United States gained for its 2.8 billion dollar investment?" It arrived at a disheartening answer: a losing deal.

　　What exactly is making this mouthpiece of American monopoly capital so discouraged? It is the growing desire of the Greek people to safeguard peace and national sovereignty.

　　"U.S. News & World Report" believes that the recent election results in Greece are proof that the United States' 2.8 billion dollar deal in Greece was a loss. This is true because it proves that dollars have not bought the hearts of the Greek people. In the words of "U.S. News & World Report" itself: "When the Greeks voted on February 19, they cast fewer votes for Premier Karamanlis' openly pro-American government than they did for the 'People's Front,' which is composed of a mixed group of parties ranging from royalists to communists. Forty-eight percent of the votes went to parties that demanded 'equal friendship' with all countries, a 'independent foreign policy' and amnesty for all imprisoned or exiled communists labeled as subversives. Forty-five percent of the votes went to Premier Karamanlis, who advocated full cooperation with the United States and its allies."

　　But the election results are only a more concentrated reflection of the Greek people's aversion to American "allies" who interfere in their affairs, violate their national independence, increase their suffering, and threaten their security. The actual situation is much richer. "U.S. News & World Report" saw that: "The prestige and reputation of the United States here have fallen to a low point some time ago" "Newspapers are filled with attacks on the United States." The United States has become so ugly in the eyes of the Greek people that "Greek army officers, who are usually the most outspoken friends of the United States, have hinted to American officers that they would be embarrassed to be seen with them before the election. Last fall, for a period of time, Greek officials did not attend banquets hosted by Americans." Even the pro-American Prime Minister Karamanlis told an American reporter before the election, "Any Greek politician who speaks well of the United States risks political damage."

　　The United States has spent a great deal of money to support anti-communist forces in Greece and has pulled Greece into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, allowing it to serve as a bridgehead for the United States in the Balkans and the Eastern Mediterranean to oppose communism and peace. But, "U.S. News & World Report" is now seeing in Greece: "Wherever you go, you can hear angry murmurs from Greeks who hope to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and are willing to strengthen ties with the Soviet Union, and even senior government officials are ominously suggesting that Greece may withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and become a neutral country between East and West..."

　　Therefore, this Wall Street propaganda machine concludes with infinite regret: "Dollars alone cannot buy the United States lasting friends, nor can they obtain firm allies against communism or lasting fortresses."

　　Indeed, this is the sorrow of those in the United States who use dollars as a tool to promote war policies and interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. But, more sadly, Washington's decision-makers do not seem to have learned the lessons they should have from their failures.

### “美元”和“友谊”

    “美元”和“友谊”
    美国政府每年拨给教育事业的费用不过三、四亿美元，同这笔经费比较来看，二十八亿美元是一个不算小的数目。据“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志说，这是美国过去十年给予希腊的“援助”的总数。这个杂志指出，美国注入希腊的军事和经济援助的钱，按每人计算超过三百四十美元，比注入世界上任何其他国家的钱来得多。
    这个惯于从纯粹生意经的角度讨论美国国内外政策的刊物提出了这样一个问题：“美国花了二十八亿美元获得了多少友谊？”它得出的是一个伤心的答案：一桩蚀本的买卖。
    究竟是什么事情使得这个美国垄断资本的喉舌这样泄气的呢？是希腊人民日益高涨的维护和平和民族主权的愿望。
    “美国新闻与世界报道”认为希腊最近的选举结果是美国在希腊的二十八亿美元买卖蚀本的证明。这是不错的，因为它证明了美元并没有收买得了希腊的人心。还是用“美国新闻与世界报道”自己的话来说：“当希腊人在二月十九日投票的时候，他们对卡拉曼利斯首相的公然亲美的政府所投的票，比他们对由保皇党一直到共产党的各种混杂党派所组成的‘人民阵线’所投的票来得少。48％的票是投给那些要求同各国保持‘一样友谊’，有一种‘独立的外交政策’和大赦一切被监禁着的、或被当作颠复分子流放出去的共产党人的党派的。45％的票投给卡拉曼利斯首相，他是主张同美国和盟国进行全面合作的。”
    但是选举结果不过是希腊人民对于干涉他们事务、侵犯他们民族独立、增加他们的苦痛、威胁他们的安全的美国“盟友”感到憎恶的一次较为集中的反映。实际情况要丰富得多。“美国新闻与世界报道”看到了：“美国在这里的威望和声誉在一些时以前已经低落到极点”“报纸上充满着对美国的攻击。”美国在希腊人民眼睛里面已经丑恶到了这种的地步，以至“通常是美国的最直言不讳的朋友的希腊陆军军官曾经对美国军官暗示说，他们在选举前被人们看见和他们在一块是会使他们受窘的。去年秋季有一个时期，希腊官员都不参加美国人举办的宴会”。甚至那位亲美国的首相卡拉曼利斯在选举前也这样对一个美国记者说，“任何希腊政治家若说美国的好话就要冒在政治上受损失的危险。”
    美国花了很大的本钱把希腊的反共势力扶持起来，并且把希腊拉进了北大西洋集团，让它充当美国在巴尔干和东地中海地区反共、反和平的一个桥头堡。但是，“美国新闻与世界报道”现在在希腊看到的事情是：“无论你走到那里，你都可以听到希望退出北大西洋公约组织和愿意同苏联加强联系的希腊人的愤怒的喃喃声，甚至高级政府官员都不祥地暗示说，希腊可能退出北大西洋公约组织而成为东西方之间的中立国家。……”
    因此，这个华尔街的宣传机器无限感叹地得出了结论：“单是美元并不能使美国得到永远的朋友，也得不到反对共产主义的坚定的盟友或持久的堡垒。”
    的确，这是美国那些用美元作为推行战争政策和干涉别国内政的工具的人的悲哀。但是，更可悲的是，华盛顿的决策者看来还没有从失败中得到应有的教训。
