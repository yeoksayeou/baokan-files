Farmers of various ethnic groups in more than a dozen counties in Guizhou Province, including Xingyi, Anshun, and Wangmo, have advanced the sowing of early-maturing crops. Agricultural cooperatives in Xingyi County have selected early-maturing seeds such as "100-day Early" and "White Millet" for sowing. Guanling County has already sown more than 4,000 mu of first-season corn. Many areas have launched the "10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu" campaign. The amount of natural fertilizer accumulated this year is generally more than double that of the same period last year. In order to ব্যাপকভাবে大量推广 双季稻、推广 double-cropping rice on a large scale, 160,000 jin of "Nante No." and 100,000 jin of "Gannong No. 3425" rice seeds have also been transferred from Jiangxi Province.

    贵州省提前播种早熟作物
    贵州省兴义、安顺、望谟等十几个县各族农民提前播种早熟作物，兴义县的农业合作社都选用了“100天早”、“小白谷”等早熟种子进行播种。关岭县已播种的4，000多亩第一季玉米。很多地区开展了“每亩田万斤肥”运动。今年积的自然肥料，一般比去年同时期增加两倍以上。为了大量推广双季稻，还从江西省调剂了16万斤“南特号”和10万斤“赣农三四二五号”谷种。
