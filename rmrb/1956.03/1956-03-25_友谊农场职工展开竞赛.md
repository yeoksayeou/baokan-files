    Friendship Farm Workers Launch Competition
    This year is the first year that the state-owned Friendship Farm has entered full-scale production. From March 21st to 22nd, the farm held a spring plowing and sowing mobilization meeting. At the meeting, the farm's branches and production teams launched a socialist labor competition with each other. The First Branch proposed that its 4,082 hectares of cultivated land should achieve a total grain output of 5,390 tons, striving to exceed the target by 544 tons. It took the lead in challenging the Second Branch, which had been praised by the general farm and Soviet experts for its preparatory work, and the Fifth Branch, which had good land conditions and high planned output. The Second Branch responded to the challenge from the First Branch with the condition of exceeding the general farm's production task by 1,050 tons, and also challenged the Fifth Branch. Wang Caoli, the farm manager, stated that he supports the socialist labor competition of the workers and will award 1,800 yuan in bonuses to the winners who achieve high yields after the autumn harvest.
    This year, the task of spring plowing and sowing at the state-owned Friendship Farm is very arduous. In addition to sowing 25,481 hectares and reclaiming 1,710 hectares on the farm itself, it must also reclaim 8,000 hectares for the surrounding farmers, nearby state-owned farms, and immigrants.

    友谊农场职工展开竞赛
    今年是国营友谊农场进入全面生产的第一年。三月二十一日到二十二日农场召开了春耕播种动员大会。会上，农场的分场之间和生产队之间，互相展开了社会主义劳动竞赛。第一分场提出全分场4，082公顷耕地，粮食总产量达到5，390吨，争取超额544吨等条件，首先向在备耕工作上受到总场和苏联专家称赞的第二分场和土地情况良好、计划产量高的第五分场挑战。第二分场以比总场的生产任务超额1，050吨为条件，向第一分场应战，并且向第五分场挑战。农场场长王操犁表示，支持职工们的社会主义劳动竞赛，秋收以后以一千八百元奖金奖给获得丰产的优胜者。
    今年国营友谊农场春耕播种的任务十分艰巨。除了本农场播种25，481公顷和开荒1，710公顷以外，同时要为周围农民、附近国营农场和移民开荒八千公顷。　　（据新华社讯）
