Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd—Beijing is actively preparing for the reorganization of joint state-private industrial production. Relevant departments are carefully studying and comprehensively planning joint state-private industries on a trade-by-trade basis, and are mobilizing workers and capitalists to discuss the plans for their respective industries.

According to the current state of production development, joint state-private enterprises in Beijing urgently require timely production reorganization. Many industries, such as printing and ironworking, have heavier production tasks this year than in previous years. For example, the Deshunhe Iron Factory, which makes parts for drilling machines in the iron industry, has its production tasks scheduled until the end of the year, but the factory's old machinery makes it difficult to complete these tasks, and it urgently needs to merge with other factories for production. Therefore, the vast majority of workers and many capitalists in various industries are eager to carry out production reorganization as soon as possible.

To adapt to this situation, the Beijing Municipal Local Industry Bureau and its affiliated specialized companies, after clearing assets and verifying capital in various industries, organized working groups or, through resident factory representatives, comprehensively understood and studied the production equipment, factory conditions, product quality and characteristics, as well as production and sales relationships, wages, welfare, and other aspects of joint state-private enterprises. They also formulated preliminary production reorganization plans and reorganization charts for some industries.

To make these plans more realistic and ensure the smooth progress of production reorganization, each industry's plan is presented to workers and capitalists for discussion to absorb their correct opinions, revise the plans, and then submit them to the Municipal People's Committee for approval and implementation. Workers and capitalists in the electrical appliances, wood processing, brick and tile, medical equipment, weaving, dyeing and knitting, and leather shoe industries, which have already formulated preliminary production reorganization plans and factory distribution charts, have been conducting discussions by district and by industry for several days.

Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd—State-owned and joint state-private businesses in Beijing are changing the unified purchasing system to allow each sales unit to purchase goods directly, thereby maintaining and promoting the operating characteristics of various industries.

This improvement in the purchasing system allows many joint state-private shops to quickly and promptly purchase goods according to customer needs. After implementing the direct purchasing method, the Yizhao Department Store requires its salespersons to go to the department store wholesale station every day to select the most needed and newest products for customers. The variety has increased from more than 900 in the past to more than 1,200. Qingjisheng Department Store, which sells small items such as needles, threads, and buttons, originally had purchasing business relationships with seven state-owned companies, including department stores, native products, and chemical raw materials. However, after the joint state-private ownership of the entire industry, many small items could not be purchased due to unified procurement. At the same time, each purchase, from purchasing, counting, warehousing, distributing, issuing transfer orders to the retail department often took a week, which could not guarantee timely supply. Recently, after changing to direct purchasing by the retail department, more than 400 varieties were quickly added, restoring the past operating characteristics.

    北京市进行公私合营工业生产改组的准备工作
    国营和公私合营商业改变统一采购制度发扬各行业的经营特色
    新华社3日讯　北京市积极进行公私合营工业生产改组的准备工作。有关部门正在对公私合营工业逐行逐业地仔细研究、统盘规划，并发动工人和资本家讨论本行业的规划。
    根据当前生产发展的情况，北京市的公私合营企业迫切要求及时进行生产改组。印刷、铁工等不少行业今年的生产任务比往年格外繁重。如铁工业中做钻探机零件的德顺合铁工厂，生产任务已经排到年底，但是厂里机器老旧难以完成这些任务，迫切需要和其他工厂合并生产。因此，各行业的广大职工和许多资本家，都渴望早日进行生产改组。
    北京市各地方工业局和所属专业公司为适应这种情况，在各行业清产核资以后，分别组织了工作组或通过驻厂员，对公私合营企业的生产设备、厂房条件、产品质量和特点以及产销关系、工资福利等各方面的情况，作了全面的了解和研究，并且分别制定了一些行业的初步生产改组规划草案和改组图表。
    为了使这些规划更加切合实际，保证生产改组顺利进行，每个行业的规划，都拿到工人和资本家中去进行讨论，吸取他们的正确意见，进行修正后再经市人民委员会批准执行。已经制定出初步生产改组规划草案和工厂分布图表的电器、木材加工、砖瓦、医疗器械、织染针织、皮鞋等行业的工人和资本家，连日来正在分区按行业进行讨论。
    新华社3日讯　北京市的国营和公私合营商业中，把统一采购制度，改变为由每个销售单位直接进货后，保持和发扬了各行业的经营特色。
    这种采购制度的改进，使许多公私合营商店能迅速及时地根据顾客的需要进货。亿兆百货店实行直接采购进货的办法后，营业员每天都要到百货批发站选购顾客最需要和最新颖的商品，品种由过去900多种增加到1，200多种。经营针头线脚等零星商品的庆记生百货店，原来和百货、土产、化工原料等7个国营公司有进货业务关系，但在全行业公私合营以后，由于统一采购，许多零星商品购不进来。同时，每进一次货，从采购、点货、入库、分货、开调拨单到门市部常常需要一周时间，不能保证及时供应。最近改由门市部直接进货后，很快就增加了400多种品种，恢复了过去的经营特色。
