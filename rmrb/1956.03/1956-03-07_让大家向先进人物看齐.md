Let Everyone Emulate Advanced Figures
Zhao Zemin

The Party organization of the Qiqihar Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant in Heilongjiang Province, when mobilizing the workers and masses to discuss the 1956 national production plan, vigorously publicized advanced figures and advanced deeds, promoting the progress of intermediate and backward workers. After leading the Huang Chengyu Group, Ben Changrong Group, and Cold Wheel Workshop's 3 groups to formulate advanced production plans, the Party organization used a variety of methods to conduct in-depth publicity among the workers. As a result, some advanced groups emerged among the workers. These groups put forward advanced plans, such as the Cast Iron Group, the Youth Advancement Group, and the Spark Group, all proposing advanced plans to complete the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule, and these plans were relatively specific and realistic. The Party organization immediately asked these 3 groups to send representatives to each workshop to propose initiatives to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and with overfulfillment. They received a warm welcome in each workshop, and the workers eagerly responded to their initiatives. For example, in the Mechanical Workshop, originally 7 groups proposed completing the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule, but after their initiative, 23 groups proposed completing the Five-Year Plan more than one year ahead of schedule. The whole plant saw the emergence of 246 advanced groups and 46 advanced individuals. The Party organization also widely praised these advanced groups and advanced figures to the workers through various forms of publicity, creating an atmosphere of learning from the advanced among the workers.

Learning from the advanced, opposing backwardness, tapping potential, finding shortcuts, learning from advanced experience, and breaking through production quotas immediately became the action slogan of all employees of the Qiqihar Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant. Guo Yufeng, an old worker in the Sand Casting Workshop, used to be unwilling to participate in meetings; this time, after listening to the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on opposing right-leaning conservatism and accelerating socialist transformation and socialist construction, and seeing the workers in the factory expressing their willingness to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and with overfulfillment, he also became active. He found 4 shortcuts and led all the workers in the group to formulate a plan to complete the 1956 production task 6 months ahead of schedule. Among the 304 workers directly engaged in production in the Metalworking and Mechanical Workshops, 182 broke through the quotas. The workers in the Assembly Workshop put forward 166 rationalization proposals in 5 days and immediately implemented 44 of them. When the large planing machine group in the Mechanical Workshop began to discuss the plan, many leading cadres believed that the strength of this group was insufficient and that there would be problems in completing this year's plan. However, after the workers in this group decided to promote 4 kinds of Soviet advanced experience and 14 kinds of advanced working methods they created themselves, they had to admit that their thinking was conservative.

In order to further use the advanced to drive the backward and give fuller play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers, the Party organization of the Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant also held a conference to commend advanced workers in a timely manner. At the meeting, responsible cadres from the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League respectively put big red flowers on 563 advanced workers. After the meeting, propagandists repeatedly carried out publicity in various forms, further mobilizing the workers. Within two hours after the meeting, the workers in the Boiler Workshop put forward 105 rationalization proposals. The leading cadres of each workshop also promptly put glorious flowers on the outstanding workers who came to the fore. According to statistics, 25% of the workers in the plant wore glorious flowers, forming a huge team of advanced workers. At this time, in order to encourage the workers to turn rationalization proposals into reality, the Party organization held another conference to reward advanced workers, and invited the family members of the workers to participate. At the meeting, material rewards were given to 48 workers who had put forward and implemented rationalization proposals. This played a great role in promoting the workers to put forward further rationalization proposals. According to statistics, during the discussion of the plan, the workers put forward a total of 1,477 rationalization proposals, exceeding the total number of rationalization proposals last year by 11%; 985 were adopted, exceeding the rationalization proposals adopted last year by 28%; 309 have been implemented, accounting for 53% of the rationalization proposals that have been implemented last year. It can be seen that the rationalization proposals put forward by the workers are not only large in quantity, but also high in quality, and many have been adopted. At the same time, the production plans set by the vast majority of groups in the plant have greatly exceeded the targets set by the administrative leadership departments. All of this shows that the socialist enthusiasm of the workers has generally increased, and as long as the Party organization is not satisfied with the existing achievements, can go deep into the workers and do a good job, and consolidate this high production enthusiasm of the workers, this factory will definitely be able to overfulfill the 1956 production plan and complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

    让大家向先进人物看齐
    赵泽民
    黑龙江省齐齐哈尔机车车辆制造厂的党组织，在发动职工群众讨论1956年国家生产计划的时候，大力地宣传了先进人物和先进事迹，推动了中间的和落后的职工前进。党组织在领导黄成玉小组、贲长荣小组和冷轮工段3个小组，制定了先进的生产计划之后，就用多种多样的方式，向职工群众进行深入的宣传。这样，在职工中间涌现出了一些先进小组。这些小组提出了先进计划，如铸铁小组、青年前进小组、火星小组都提出了要提前一年完成五年计划的先进计划，这些计划都订得比较具体和切合实际。党组织立即要这3个小组派出代表，到每个车间提出提前和超额完成五年计划的倡议。他们在各个车间，受到了热烈的欢迎，工友们争先恐后地响应他们的倡议。如机械车间，原来有7个小组提出提前一年完成五年计划，经过他们倡议后，有23个小组提出提前一年以上完成五年计划。全厂出现了246个先进小组和46个先进的个人。党组织又通过多种宣传形式，广泛地向职工们表扬了这些先进小组和先进人物，在职工群众中间造成了向先进看齐的气氛。
    向先进看齐，反对落后，挖潜力，找窍门，学习先进经验，突破生产定额，立刻成为齐齐哈尔机车车辆制造厂全体职工的行动口号。翻砂车间的老工友郭玉峰，过去开会都不愿参加；这次，他听了中共中央关于反对右倾保守、加速社会主义改造和社会主义建设的指示，又看见厂里的工友们纷纷表示要提前和超额完成五年计划，也变得积极起来。他找了4个窍门，并且带动全组工友订出了一个提前6个月完成1956年生产的任务的计划。金工、机械两个车间直接从事生产的304个工人中，有182人突破了定额。装配车间的职工们，5天提出了166件合理化建议，并且立即实现了44件。机械车间的大刨床组开始讨论计划的时候，有不少领导干部认为这个组的力量不足，完成今年的计划有问题。可是，等到这个小组的工友确定推广4种苏联先进经验和自己创造的14种先进工作方法以后，他们就不得不承认自己的思想保守了。
    为了进一步用先进带动落后，更加充分地发挥职工群众的积极性和创造性，机车车辆制造厂的党组织又及时地召开了表扬先进工作者的大会。会上，由党、政、工、团的负责干部，分别给563名先进工作者戴上了大红花。会后，宣传员又通过各种形式反复地进行宣传，进一步把职工发动起来。锅炉车间在会后的两个小时内，职工们就提出了105件合理化建议。各个车间的领导干部，又及时地给后起的优秀职工带上了光荣花。据统计，全厂有25％的职工带上了光荣花，形成了一个庞大的先进工作者队伍。这时，党组织为了鼓励职工群众把合理化建议变成现实，又召开了奖励先进工作者大会，并且邀请职工的家属参加。会上，对提出并已实现合理化建议的48名职工进行了物质奖励。这对于推动职工群众进一步提合理化建议起了很大的推动作用。据统计：该厂在讨论计划的期间，职工们共提出1，477件合理化建议，超过去年合理化建议总数11％；被采纳的有985件，超过去年被采纳的合理化建议28％；已经实现的309件，为去年已经实现的合理化建议数的53％。由此可见，职工们提出的合理化建议不仅是数量多，而且质量高，被采纳的多。同时全厂绝大多数小组订的生产计划，都大大地突破了行政领导部门规定的指标。所有这些都说明，职工群众的社会主义积极性已经普遍高涨，党组织只要不满足现有成绩，能够深入职工群众做好工作，把职工群众的这种高涨的生产热情巩固起来，这个工厂就一定能够超额完成1956年的生产计划和提前完成五年计划。
