    Cooperative Stores Set Plans

    The Shashi Fresh Fish Cooperative Store in Hubei Province was organized last December. Recently, they formulated a business plan for 1956 to 1962, which includes specific plans for expanding commodity circulation, reducing circulation costs, and improving the material and cultural living standards of the store's staff.

    Whether the content of the Shashi Fresh Fish Cooperative Store's business plan is appropriate remains to be proven in practice. However, this method of formulating plans is worth promoting. Because it can guide cooperative members to focus their attention on production, stabilize emotions, and improve management.

    Facts have also proved that after they formulated the plan, their work had goals and prospects; and through discussing the business plan and studying the needs of the people, the members further clarified their tasks and responsibilities. In this way, the enthusiasm of the members has been further increased, business management has been improved, and the quality of service for production and consumers has also been improved.

    合作商店订规划
    湖北省沙市鲜鱼合作商店是去年12月组织起来的。最近他们制定了1956年到1962年的经营规划，里面包括了扩大商品流转，降低流转费用和提高商店工作人员物质文化生活水平等许多方面的具体计划。
    沙市鲜鱼合作商店经营规划的内容是否恰当，这还要在实践中去证明。不过，这种制定规划的办法却是值得提倡的。因为它可以引导合作社的社员把注意力集中到生产方面去，安定情绪，改善经营。
    事实也证明，他们制定规划以后，工作有了目标和远景；并且通过讨论经营规划，研究人民需要，使社员们进一步明确了自己的任务和责任。这样，社员们的积极性就更加高涨，经营管理有了改善，为生产和消费者服务的质量也提高了。
