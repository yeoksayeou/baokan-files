Let Rural Audiences See Films with Diverse Themes
Su Fang
    Newspaper editorial departments frequently receive letters from rural readers regarding their opinions on films. One letter, from a certain small town in Wuxi County, Jiangsu Province, stated: We mostly see stories about rural life, such as "People Strive for Higher Positions" and "The Spring Breeze Blows to the Nomin River," as well as some scientific and educational films about agricultural production; aside from these, we rarely see films with other themes. To rural audiences, is there no need to know about socialist industrialization and other aspects besides agricultural cooperation and rural life, such as the achievements of the motherland like the harnessing of the Huai River? This letter, and many others, sharply point out: there are significant shortcomings in the way the relevant leading organs allocate films to rural film projection teams.
    In the past two years, the scope of themes in film art has gradually expanded, and the content has become increasingly rich. We have filmed various themed films reflecting the lives of the working class, reflecting revolutionary wars, about anti-espionage struggles, about children; we have also produced many excellent stage play documentaries and current affairs short films, scientific and educational short films, and translated many excellent films from fraternal countries and progressive films from capitalist countries. However, why do rural audiences always see films that reflect rural life? The key issue lies in the fact that the relevant leading organs have neglected the enormous ideological education role of film as a powerful tool for "self-education and self-improvement of workers and peasants," and neglected the diverse demands of hundreds of millions of rural audiences for film art content, and simply started from the view that film content should be closely combined with agricultural production. Therefore, the films distributed to rural film projection teams are not diverse enough, giving rural audiences a monotonous feeling. Taking the films distributed by the China Film Distribution Company to rural film projection teams during the Spring Festival of 1954 and 1955 as an example: In 1954, the feature films allocated were seven, including "Bumper Harvest"; the short films were five, including "Exhibition of Land Reform in the Central and Southern Regions." In 1955, the feature films were five, including "The Spring Breeze Blows to the Nomin River"; the short films were three, including "The Advantages of New Agricultural Implements." Apart from a very small number of films such as "Folk Songs and Dances," the vast majority are films directly reflecting rural life. From this film allocation list, it is not difficult to see how narrow the content of the films screened in rural areas is! In addition, the one-sided emphasis by certain local propaganda departments on the idea that film content should be combined with the current central work in the local area also affected the diversification of the content of films screened in rural areas.
    Rural film audiences are mainly peasants. They feel particularly close to and easily accept films reflecting rural life. At the same time, due to the low cultural level of peasants, they are not easy to understand some films with relatively profound meanings and complex plots (mainly some translated films). Therefore, it is right to make appropriate selections for the films distributed to rural film projection teams. However, in any case, this does not mean that the themes of films screened in rural areas must be limited to the scope of agricultural production.
    Film is the most mass-oriented propaganda tool. When we screen films in rural areas, we should not only use it to encourage peasants to develop agricultural production and build their own happy lives, but more importantly, we should use it to educate peasants with socialist spirit, organize them to fight for socialism, and improve their ideological awareness and cultural level. All propaganda in rural areas should be closely integrated with socialist ideological education. At the same time, we need to strive to instill knowledge in various fields into the culturally backward rural areas. If we understand the educational role of films for peasants too narrowly, and only let peasants watch some films reflecting agricultural production, the result will be to weaken the combat effectiveness of film as a propaganda and mobilization weapon.
    The view that peasants only need to watch films reflecting rural life is also obviously subjective and one-sided. We must know that today's countryside is no longer the countryside of the era of reactionary rule. With social changes and the improvement of economic conditions, the thoughts, lives, and moods of peasants have undergone great changes. They are not only concerned about agricultural production, but also concerned about the great victories on various production fronts of the motherland, concerned about various major changes and reforms in society, concerned about various major events happening in the world. How much they need to see all of this from film art! Doesn't the letter mentioned earlier powerfully illustrate this point?
    Relevant leading organs and local propaganda departments must attach importance to the enormous educational role of film for peasants, attach importance to the diverse demands of rural audiences for films, expand the scope of themes of rural film screenings, so that peasants can be exposed to a broader world and a richer life from various themes and styles of films; so that peasants can not only recognize the importance of agricultural production from films, learn more new agricultural technology knowledge, but also see the ever-changing face of the motherland, see the hard work and happy lives of the people of fraternal countries, and see the unparalleled strength of the peace and democracy camp. This will broaden their horizons, strengthen their patriotic education, and inspire their labor enthusiasm, which is absolutely necessary for both the development of agricultural production and the entire socialist construction cause.
    The China Film Distribution Company under the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture has already made some improvements in the work of allocating films to rural film projection teams, and this year it has allocated more films with themes other than agricultural production. We hope that starting from this improvement, we will further attach importance to this work ideologically, take necessary measures, and obtain the support and assistance of local propaganda departments, so that the films screened in rural areas can catch up with the new situation in rural areas and meet the needs of peasants.

### 让农村观众看到多方面题材的影片

    让农村观众看到多方面题材的影片
    苏方
    报纸编辑部经常收到一些关于电影方面意见的农村读者来信。其中一封来自江苏省无锡县某小镇的信上这样写着：我们看到的多半是“人往高处走”、“春风吹到诺敏河”等表现农村生活的故事片和一些关于农业生产的科学教育片；除此以外，旁的题材的影片就很少看到了。这封信和其它许多来信都尖锐地提出：为什么我们长久看不到关于工业建设和祖国其它方面成就如治理淮河等方面题材的影片呢？对农村观众来说，难道除了农业合作化和农村生活以外，就不需要知道有关社会主义工业化等其它方面的情况了吗？从这封来信里面，说明了在有关领导机关给农村电影放映队配片方面存在着很大的缺点。
    近两年来，电影艺术的题材范围日渐扩大，内容已经日渐丰富起来。我们拍摄了反映工人阶级生活、反映革命战争、关于反特斗争、关于少年儿童的多种主题的影片；我们还摄制了许多优秀舞台剧纪录片和时事短片、科学教育短片，翻译了许多兄弟国家的优秀影片和资本主义国家的进步影片。但是，农村观众看到的为什么总是些表现农村生活的影片呢？问题的关键就在于有关领导机关忽视了作为“工农自我教育和自我进步”的有力工具的电影对农民的巨大的思想教育作用，忽视了数以亿计的农村观众对于电影艺术内容的多方面的要求，单纯从影片内容应该紧密和农业生产相结合这一观点出发，因此分配给农村电影放映队的影片不够多样，给农村观众以单调的感觉。以1954、1955年春节期间中国电影发行公司分配给农村电影放映队的影片为例：1954年配给的长片是“丰收”等七部；短片是“中南区土改展览”等五部。1955年长片是“春风吹到诺敏河”等五部；短片是“新式农具好处多”等三部。除去极少量的如“民间歌舞”等片外，绝大部分都是直接反映农村生活的影片。从这一配片表上，也就不难看出在农村放映的影片内容多么狭窄！此外，某些地方宣传部门片面地强调影片内容应该同当地的当前中心工作相结合等情况，也影响了农村映出影片内容的多样化。
    农村电影观众主要是农民，他们看反映农村生活的影片会格外感到亲切，也格外易于接受；同时由于农民文化水平较低，对于一些涵义比较深奥、情节比较复杂的影片（主要应该是某些翻译片），不大容易理解。因此，分配给农村电影放映队的影片，应该作适度的选择，这是对的。但是，无论如何，这并不意味着在农村放映的电影主题一定只能局限在农业生产范围以内。
    电影是最富于群众性的宣传工具。我们在农村放映电影，不仅是要利用它来鼓励农民发展农业生产、建设自己幸福生活的热情，更重要的是要通过它以社会主义精神去教育农民，组织他们为社会主义而斗争，提高他们的思想觉悟和文化水平。农村的一切宣传，都应该同社会主义思想教育紧密地结合起来。同时，还需要对文化落后的农村努力灌输各方面的知识。如果过于狭窄地去理解影片对于农民的教育作用，只让农民看一些反映农业生产的影片，结果就会削弱电影这一宣传鼓动武器的战斗力。
    那种认为农民只需要看反映农村生活的影片的看法，显然也是主观片面的。要知道：今天的农村，已经不是反动统治时代的农村了。随着社会的变革，随着经济情况的好转，农民的思想、生活和心情都发生了很大的变化。他们不仅关心着农业生产，也关心着祖国各个生产战线上的巨大胜利，关心着社会上各种重大的变化、改革，关心着世界上所发生的各种大事情，他们是多么需要从电影艺术里面看到这一切啊！前面提到的那封来信，不就有力地说明了这一点吗？
    有关领导机关和各地宣传部门必须重视电影对于农民的巨大教育作用，重视农村观众对于影片的多方面的要求，扩大农村电影放映的题材范围，使农民能够从各种题材、各种样式的影片中，接触到更广阔的世界、更丰富的生活；使农民不仅能从影片中认识到农业生产的重要性，学习到更多的新的农业技术知识，同时还可以看到祖国日新月异的面貌，看到兄弟国家人民的辛勤劳动和幸福生活，看到和平民主阵营的无比强大。从而扩大他们的眼界，加强他们的爱国主义教育，鼓舞他们的劳动热情，这无论对发展农业生产或整个社会主义建设事业来说，都是完全必要的。
    文化部电影局所属的中国电影发行公司在给农村电影放映队的配片工作上，已经作了一些改进，今年已经较多地配给了一些农业生产主题以外的影片。我们希望从这个改进开始，进一步从思想上重视这项工作，采取必要措施，并且取得各地宣传部门的支持和协助，使在农村放映的电影赶上农村的新形势，满足农民的需要。
