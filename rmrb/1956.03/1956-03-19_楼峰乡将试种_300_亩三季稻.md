Loufeng Township to Pilot 300 Mu of Three-Season Rice

　　Six agricultural production cooperatives in Loufeng Township, Longchang County, Sichuan Province, will pilot three-season rice on 300 mu of paddy fields this year. The three-season rice to be piloted will use the "Yinfang Gengdao" improved variety, which matures more than 20 days earlier than the local general early rice. In the planting process, ratooning rice will be left after the early rice is harvested, and late rice will be planted in the ratooning rice fields. It is estimated that the yield per mu can reach 1,400 jin after the autumn harvest.

　　Loufeng Township has a warm climate and abundant rainfall, and local farmers often have the habit of planting double-season rice. After the successful trial planting of three-season rice this year, the Luzhou Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party will promote it on a large scale in the area.

    楼峰乡将试种300亩三季稻
    四川省隆昌县楼峰乡6个农业生产合作社今年将在300亩水田中试种三季稻。试种的三季稻将采用较当地一般早稻早熟20多天的“银坊梗稻”良种，在种植过程中采用早稻收后留再生稻，在再生稻田中再栽晚稻。预计秋收后每亩产量可达到1，400斤。
    楼峰乡气候温暖，雨量充足，当地农民多有种双季稻的习惯。今年三季稻试种成功后，中共泸州地委将在当地大面积地推广。
