Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd, Paris: According to TASS, Paris, March 3rd: French Foreign Minister Christian Pineau delivered a lengthy speech at a luncheon held by the Anglo-American Press Association in Paris on March 2nd, discussing the most important issues in the current international situation. According to Agence France-Presse, he said that he completely disagreed with "the general tendency of the West's policies on issues of war and peace." According to Pineau, it is wrong for Western countries to "focus on purely military strength," because in this case, the West loses ground due to "the Communists' emphasis on peace propaganda." Pineau said that the public will support those who propose peaceful solutions, rather than those who often talk about seeking solutions through war.

Pineau continued, for Eastern countries, there are only two possible attitudes: "Either wage a full-scale war against them - a policy that has been abandoned, and I am glad for it; or we must strive for coexistence... I am willing to persuade our British and American friends to revise their foreign policies. The policy of war has been rejected. Now, a policy of peace must be pursued to ensure the victory of our common ideals - justice, equality, and freedom."

Pineau further stated that France can play the role of a connecting link between the East and the West, and whenever possible, it will view the convening of international conferences with sympathy.

He said that at these conferences, France will support decisions that mean reconciling "the positions of the East and the West."

Regarding this, Pineau recalled that French Prime Minister Mollet once suggested that discussions on German reunification should only begin after progress has been made on disarmament.

Pineau also said that he had instructed the French representative to the subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission, Moch, to prepare a draft summarizing the proposals of President Eisenhower, Eden, Faure, and Bulganin. Pineau said, "We will defend this synthesis in the subcommittee."

He discussed the situation in the Near East and expressed regret that France was not consulted on certain issues, especially on the Baghdad Pact.

Pineau then turned to the situation in Indochina, characterized by the difficulties that have already occurred in the relationship between France and South Vietnam and the greater penetration of American influence. He said that he does not intend to blame the Americans, because "they did not intentionally cause this harm." But Pineau emphasized that the United States supported the current South Vietnamese government, which demanded the withdrawal of French expeditionary forces, against France.

Pineau added that France, in principle, does not oppose the suggestions of certain countries to convene a new conference on the Indochina issue, as long as the United States and South Vietnam also participate. But according to Pineau, these two countries are unwilling to participate in such a conference.

Finally, the Foreign Minister spoke in detail about the problems of North Africa.

When asked what practical results could be expected from his and Prime Minister Mollet's visit to Moscow, Pineau replied that it was a matter of establishing contact. He said, "We will specifically study economic and cultural issues. We will be very happy to do so, as long as we can eliminate some of the misunderstandings that have existed between our two countries in recent years."

When listing several mistakes the West has recently made in its relations with the East, Pineau recalled the naval exercises held in the Gulf of Siam. Pineau said: "Do you think that in the atomic age, these few ships can give the impression that the West is ruling the world? Marshal Bulganin and Mr. Khrushchev have expressed their willingness to provide Asian countries with any assistance they need, especially in the economic field. Their approach is a much more important activity than these naval exercises. If the West does not make efforts in the spirit of proposing peace, we will be defeated in propaganda and politics."

Prior to this conversation, Pineau told the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate of the Republic on March 1 that he intends to pursue a policy based on maintaining "complete independence on all sides." Pineau said that France should act as a "bridge between blocs, without abandoning its friendly alliances."

    法外长比诺要求修改西方外交政策
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社巴黎3日讯：法国外交部长比诺3月2日在巴黎英美记者协会举行的午宴会上发表了长篇演说，谈论目前国际局势中最重要的问题。据法新社消息，他说，他完全不同意“西方对战争与和平问题的政策的一般倾向”。据比诺说，西方国家“侧重纯军事力量”是错误的，因为在这种情况下，西方由于“共产党人侧重和平宣传”而失去了地位。比诺说，公众将支持那些建议和平解决的人们，而不支持那些时常谈到用战争求得解决的人们。
    比诺继续说，对于东方国家，只有两种可能的态度：“要么就是对它们进行全面战争——这种政策已经被放弃，我对此感到高兴；要么我们必须争取共处……我愿意说服我们的英国和美国朋友修改他们的外交政策。战争政策已经遭到拒绝。现在必须奉行和平政策来保证我们的共同理想——正义，平等和自由的胜利。”
    比诺进一步说，法国可以起东西方之间的联系环节的作用，只要可能，它将以同情的态度看待召开国际会议的事情。
    他说，在这些会议上，法国将支持意味着调和“东西方立场”的决定。
    关于这一点，比诺追述说，法国总理摩勒曾经建议，只有在裁军方面作出进展后才可以开始讨论德国统一问题。
    比诺还说，他已经训令联合国裁军委员会的小组委员会中的法国代表莫克准备一个总结艾森豪威尔总统、艾登、富尔和布尔加宁的建议的草案。比诺说，“我们将在小组委员会中为这个综合的东西辩护。”
    他谈论了近东的局势，并且对于在某些问题上，特别是在巴格达条约问题上没有同法国磋商一事表示遗憾。
    比诺转而谈到以法国和南越的关系中已经发生的困难和美国的势力已经更大程度地渗入为特征的印度支那的局势。他说，他不打算责备美国人，因为“他们不是故意造成这种危害的”。但是比诺强调说，美国支持了要求法国远征军部队撤退的现在的南越政府来反对法国。
    比诺又说，法国在原则上不反对某些国家关于召开一次新的印度支那问题会议的建议，只要美国和南越也参加。但是据比诺说，这两个国家并不愿意参加这样一个会议。
    最后，这位外交部长详细谈论了北非的问题。
    有人问他同政府首脑摩勒一道访问莫斯科可望得到什么实际结果，比诺答复说，这是一个建立联系的问题。他说，“我们将具体地研究经济和文化问题。只要我们能够消除最近几年在我们两国之间存在的一些误解，我们将十分高兴地这样做。”
    比诺在列举西方最近在它同东方的关系中所犯的若干错误的时候追述了在暹罗湾举行的海军演习。比诺说：“难道你们认为在原子时代，这几艘舰只就能够给人以西方在统治着全世界的印象吗？布尔加宁元帅和赫鲁晓夫先生表示愿意对亚洲国家提供它们所需要的任何援助，特别是在经济方面的援助。他们的这种做法是比这种海军演习重要得多的活动。如果西方不本着提出和平建议的精神作努力的话，我们就将在宣传和政治方面遭到失败。”
    在这次谈话以前，比诺在3月1日告诉共和国参议院外交委员会说，他打算奉行以保持“对一切方面完全独立”为基础的政策。比诺说，法国应该充当“集团之间的桥梁，同时又不放弃它的友好同盟”。
