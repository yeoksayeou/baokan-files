Do a Good Job in the 1956 Tea Pre-Purchase Work
Guoguang

On January 27, the State Council issued instructions on pre-purchasing economic crops such as tea, deciding to pre-purchase tea by different categories and regions, comprehensively or partially, and requiring people's committees at all levels to properly arrange pre-purchase work in conjunction with spring plowing and production.

Tea is one of China's major economic crops. Historically, China's tea production and export volume ranked first in the world for a long time. Since liberation, although China's tea production has recovered and developed to a certain extent, so far, the production volume has only reached 60% of the normal annual output before the Anti-Japanese War, and the export volume is only a quarter of the highest year in history. Domestic and border sales levels are also very low. This situation is obviously incompatible with the rapid development of the country's socialist construction, the continuous improvement of people's living standards, and the ever-expanding domestic and foreign markets.

Pre-purchasing tea is one of the main measures to develop tea production. By signing pre-purchase contracts between the state and tea farmers, tea farmers can produce according to the needs of the state, and tea farmers can obtain interest-free deposits and material supplies from the state based on the pre-purchase contracts, solving production and living problems, thereby ensuring increased tea production.

This year's tea pre-purchase quantity has been greatly expanded. The total pre-purchase amount accounts for 60% of the estimated annual commercial tea quantity, which is close to twice the actual pre-purchase performance of last year. By signing pre-purchase contracts, tea farmers will receive 15%-40% of the total pre-purchase value as a deposit. The total amount of pre-purchase deposits issued by the state this year will increase by 2.7 times compared to last year due to the increase in the deposit ratio per dan of tea and the expansion of the total pre-purchase volume. Farmers do not have to pay interest on pre-purchase deposits, and they will be returned in batches after the new tea is on the market. The tea sold by tea farmers will still be evaluated and priced according to the principle of good tea at a good price, second-class tea at a second-class price, sample evaluation, and pricing based on quality, and will not be affected by pre-purchase.

In order to take care of the tea farmers' food difficulties in temporarily hiring people to pick and process tea during the tea picking season, the state has also stipulated this year that tea farmers will be given preferential treatment in increasing the supply of grain. That is, for every dan of tea sold by tea farmers outside the prescribed grain unified sales quota, the state will supply an additional 16-32 jin of grain (an average of 25 jin). Tea farmers who sign pre-purchase contracts with the state can get a prescribed amount of grain coupons based on the estimated tea sales volume after signing the contract, and they can get more if they produce and sell more.

In order to increase tea production, the quantity of fertilizers supplied to tea areas by supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels will also increase this year.

Paying pre-purchase deposits and increasing the supply of grain and fertilizer are all material forces to ensure increased tea production. In addition, the tea purchase price this year will be higher than last year, which makes the completion and over-completion of this year's tea production plan very favorable.

Now that the tea picking season is approaching, purchasing departments at all levels should immediately cooperate with relevant departments, under the leadership of the local party and government organs, and act in accordance with the State Council's instructions on tea pre-purchase and preferential grain supply. Due to the seasonality of tea production and the suddenness of the picking and processing work, the tea pre-purchase work must be completed one month before the new tea is on the market, and time is very tight. Within this short period of time, the first thing to do is to do a good job in publicity, mobilization, and investigation. Under the unified arrangement and leadership of the party and government, in conjunction with the current central work, a meeting should be held at the township level, including township staff, including party members, members of the Communist Youth League, directors of agricultural production cooperatives, leaders of mutual aid groups, staff of grassroots purchasing stations, directors and supervisors of supply and marketing cooperatives, and representatives of members, to explain the significance of pre-purchase and the specific methods and procedures of pre-purchase work, and improve everyone's understanding of pre-purchase work. At the same time, a pre-purchase work committee or work group should be organized to help agricultural cooperatives, etc., formulate and revise tea picking and processing plans through visits and investigations. On the basis of understanding the production situation and improving the masses' understanding, tea farmers should be mobilized to voluntarily report the pre-purchase quantity and the amount of deposit required, and conduct careful evaluation. When signing the pre-purchase contract, the pre-purchase deposit and preferential grain vouchers should be issued to the farmers at one time. In non-pre-purchase tea areas, the preferential grain vouchers should also be issued to tea-producing households through the township people's committees, so that they can play their due role in solving the farmers' production problems in a timely manner.

After the pre-purchase is completed in each area, a review of the pre-purchase contract should be carried out to verify the pre-purchase object, pre-purchase quantity, tea garden and production situation. If there are any phenomena of false reporting, fraudulent claiming, or underreporting, they should be corrected in a timely manner. At the same time, farmers should be educated to abide by the credit of the pre-purchase contract, actively increase production, and complete the state's purchase plan. It should also cooperate with the agricultural department to strengthen guidance on tea production and initial processing to ensure a bumper tea harvest and achieve good quality and quantity. In addition, the pre-purchase work should be closely linked with the purchase work, and the pre-purchase recovery and contract clearing work should be done in conjunction with the purchase; prevent the phenomenon of only focusing on purchase and not recovering the pre-purchase deposit, or only focusing on recovering the pre-purchase deposit and not completing the pre-purchase quantity.

    做好1956年茶叶预购工作
    国光
    1月27日国务院发布了关于预购茶叶等经济作物的指示，决定对茶叶按不同的品类、地区、全面地或部分地进行预购，并且要求各级人民委员会结合春耕生产工作，将预购工作妥善进行布置。
    茶叶是我国的主要经济作物。历史上我国的茶叶产量和出口数量长期占世界第一位。解放以来，我国茶叶生产虽然有了一定程度的恢复和发展，但是截至目前为止，生产量只达到抗日战争以前常年产量的60％，出口量只及历史上最高年份的四分之一，内销、边销水平也很低。这种情况，和当前国家社会主义建设的飞速发展、人民生活水平的不断提高、国内外市场的日益扩大的形势显然是不相适应的。
    对茶叶实行预购，是发展茶叶生产的主要措施之一。通过国家和茶农订立预购合同，可以使茶农按照国家的需要来进行生产，使茶农根据预购合同取得国家的无息定金和实物供应，解决生产和生活上的问题，从而使增产茶叶得到保证。
    今年茶叶预购数量比去年大为扩大，预购总额占全年预计商品茶数量的60％，接近去年预购实绩的二倍。通过签订预购合同，茶农将得到预购总值15％—40％的预购定金。今年国家发放的预购定金总额由于每担茶叶定金比例的提高和预购总量的扩大，将比去年增加2.7倍。预购定金不要农民负担利息，在新茶上市后分批归还。茶农拨售的茶叶仍按好茶好价、次茶次价、对样评茶、按质论价的原则，按规定牌价审评给价，不因预购而受到影响。
    为了照顾茶农在采茶季节临时雇人采茶制茶的粮食困难，国家今年又规定对茶农给予增加供应粮食的优待。即茶农在规定的粮食统销定额以外，每出售一担茶叶，国家再另外供应粮食16—32斤（平均25斤）。同国家签订预购合同的茶农，在签订合同后即可根据预计售茶量，得到规定数量的粮票，多产多售还可多得。
    为了增产茶叶的需要，各级供销合作社供应茶区的肥料数量今年也将增多。
    支付预购定金，增加粮食、肥料供应，都是保证茶叶增产的物质力量，再加上今年的茶叶采购价格将比去年有所提高，这就使今年茶叶生产计划的完成和超额完成获得了非常有利的条件。
    现在，采茶季节即将到来，各级采购部门应当立即配合有关部门，在当地党政机关领导下，遵照国务院茶叶预购和粮食优待供应等指示行动起来。由于茶叶生产的季节性和采制工作的突击性，茶叶预购工作必须在新茶上市前一个月办理完毕，时间是很紧迫的。在这短短时间内，首先要做好宣传动员和调查摸底工作。应当在党政统一布置领导下，结合当前中心工作，以乡为单位召开乡的工作人员包括党员、团员、农业生产合作社主任、互助组组长、基层采购站工作人员、供销合作社理监事、社员代表等参加的会议，讲清预购意义以及预购工作的具体方法和手续，提高大家对预购工作的认识。同时，要组织预购工作委员会或工作组，通过访问调查，帮助农业合作社等制定和修订茶叶采制计划。在摸清生产情况和提高群众认识的基础上，发动茶农依据自愿原则，自报预购量和所需定金数量，并且进行慎重审评。在签订预购合同的时候，把预购定金及优待粮凭证一次发给农民。非预购茶叶地区，也应该通过乡人民委员会把优待粮凭证发到茶叶生产户，使它对于解决农民生产上的问题及时起到应有的效用。
    在每一地区预购完毕以后，应该进行一次预购合同的复查工作，核实预购对象、预购数量、茶园及生产情况，如有虚报冒领、以少报多的现象，应该及时纠正。同时应该教育农民遵守预购合同的信用，积极增加生产，完成国家收购计划。还应该配合农业部门，加强对茶叶生产和初制的指导，以保证茶叶丰收，达到质好量多。此外，预购工作应和收购工作紧密联系，结合收购做好预购收回和合同清理工作；防止只顾采购不管收回预购定金，或只顾收回预购定金不管完成预购数量的现象发生。
