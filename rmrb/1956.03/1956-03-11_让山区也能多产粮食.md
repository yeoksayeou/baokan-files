    Let Mountainous Areas Also Produce More Grain
    To the Editor:
    Tonghua Prefecture in Jilin Province is a mountainous area, with mountainous land covering more than 180,000 hectares, accounting for about 53% of the total sown area in the region. In several counties near Changbai Mountain, due to sparse population and abundant land, coupled with the past dispersed management by farmers who lacked the capacity to carry out soil and water conservation work, soil erosion and sand and gravel deposition caused by water have resulted in declining yields year after year. Now, with the development of the agricultural cooperative movement, favorable conditions have been created for transforming mountainous areas. Some counties have already formulated plans for soil and water conservation work in mountainous areas based on local natural conditions and specific circumstances.
    In order to transform the mountainous areas, Fushong County plans to build 700 hectares of terraced fields this year. The county's agricultural science department has also summarized the experience of some farmers in Malugou Village in the suburbs who have improved mountain yields by adopting methods such as building terraced fields, changing contour plowing to horizontal plowing, leaving fallow squares, and planting trees, and is promoting it. For example,社员陈学成, 社员陈学成’s 3 mu of land in Yongsheng No. 1 Cooperative was very barren due to not applying manure in the past and severe soil erosion. In 1954, the average yield was only 3 dou of grain per mu (50 jin per dou); after digging ditches and contour plowing around the mountain shape, in 1955, two mu of land yielded 1 shi and 3 dou of grain. Wang Zhongqi, a member of the same cooperative, terraced 2.8 hectares of land into 3 terraces, and planted trees on the top of the mountain, which increased the silt layer and improved the fertility of the land, and also made it easier to plow. In 1955, two hectares of mountain land yielded 18 shi of grain, which was 2 shi and 8 dou more per hectare than before, an increase of 38.8%. Xu Yuangui's 3 mu of mountain land was washed into a large ditch by water. They built a small horizontal dam 2 zhang away in the ditch to slow down the water flow and increase silt, reducing the scouring force of the mountain water. In 1955, they harvested a total of 2 shi and 1 dou of grain, which was 4 dou more per mu than in the past.
    It is hoped that other regions can also make plans for developing mountainous areas and soil and water conservation based on local characteristics.

### 让山区也能多产粮食

    让山区也能多产粮食编辑同志：
    吉林省通化专区是个山区，山地面积有18万多垧，约占全区播种面积的53％。在靠近长白山附近的几个县，由于人少地广，加上过去农民分散经营，无力进行水土保持工作，因而造成山地水土流失和水冲砂压的现象，产量年年降低。现在，随着农业合作化运动的发展，改造山区有了有利的条件，有的县已经根据当地自然条件和具体情况作出了山区水土保持工作的规划。
    抚松县为了改造山区，规划在今年修梯田700垧，县农业科又总结了郊区马鹿沟村部分农民采取修梯田、改顺垅为横垅、留荒格子和栽树等办法而提高了山地产量的经验加以推广。如永生一社社员陈学成的3亩地，由于从前不上粪和水土大量流失，土地很瘠薄，1954年每亩平均产量只有3斗粮食（每斗50斤）；在挖沟和围绕山形作垅以后，1955年两亩地就打了1石3斗粮食。这个社的社员王中起有2垧8亩地修成了3道梯田，在山地顶上又栽了树木，增加了淤泥层，提高了地力，而且还便于起犁，1955年有两垧山地就打了18石粮食，比原来每垧多打了2石8斗，增产了38.8％。社员徐远贵的3亩山地，因为被水冲成了大沟，他们就在沟内两丈远的地方打成一条横小坝，从而缓和了水速和增多了淤泥，减轻了山水的冲刷力，1955年一共打2石1斗粮，每亩比过去多打了4斗。
    希望其他地区也能根据当地的特点，作好发展山区和水土保持的规划。
