    The Karachi Conference Cannot Save the Failure of the "Policy of Strength" in Asia

    Since the "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" Council held its first meeting in Bangkok in February last year, great changes have taken place in the international situation in the year leading up to the second meeting in Karachi. The "Geneva Spirit," which advocates easing international tensions and resolving international disputes through consultation, and the "Bandung Spirit," which advocates peaceful coexistence and opposes colonialism, are increasingly taking root in people's hearts; the "policy of strength" built on piecing together military blocs and preparing for atomic war is constantly failing. This has left the planners of the Manila Treaty increasingly isolated and in a passive position.

    As everyone knows, the Manila Treaty is an important tool for the United States in pursuing its "policy of strength" in Asia. The spearhead of this treaty is directed at the People's Republic of China and other peace-loving Asian countries. This treaty has a distinct colonial nature of suppressing Asian national liberation movements. At the same time, this treaty has another purpose, which is to obstruct the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords in the three Indochinese states. Therefore, from the day it was established, this treaty has been resolutely opposed by the people of Asian countries.

    For a year, under the coercion of the United States, this aggressive military bloc has held two so-called "Military Advisors Meetings," two so-called "Staff Planning Personnel Meetings," and two so-called "Anti-Subversion Activities Meetings"; it has also held a series of meetings such as "Military Intelligence Agency Chiefs Meetings," "Logistics Issues Meetings," "Weapons Standardization Meetings," and "Military Training and Exercises Meetings." Before the Karachi Conference, the United States also conducted a so-called "Firm Link" military exercise in the Gulf of Siam and near Bangkok. The United States has tried to equip the "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" with "teeth," display "strength," and intimidate Asian countries in order to push Asia step by step to the brink of war.

    However, the actual development is contrary to Washington's subjective wishes.

    The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by the Prime Ministers of China, India, and Burma have been accepted by Asian and African countries at the Asian-African Conference, becoming the foundation for relations between countries, and have been further developed in the declaration of the Asian-African Conference. More and more Asian countries are pursuing a policy of peace and neutrality, condemning the United States' military bloc policy.

    The United States' attempt to drag the three Indochinese states into the conspiracy of the Southeast Asian military bloc has also been thwarted. Cambodia has rejected the "protection" given by the Manila Treaty. The Lao government has announced its willingness to establish friendly relations with its neighbors based on the Five Principles. The situation in South Vietnam, created single-handedly by the United States, is increasingly endangering the interests of the countries concerned, thus arousing accusations from all sides.

    The facts since the signing of the Manila Treaty show that Asian countries cannot gain any benefit from participating in aggressive military blocs, but can only bring them increasingly dangerous consequences. Under the guise of "defense" and "alliance," the militarists of the United States have forced Asian member states to undertake the obligation of increasing military spending at the expense of increasing the burden on the people, the obligation of refusing to develop friendly cooperation and strengthen economic and cultural ties with peace-loving countries, and the obligation of allowing the United States to carry out colonial enslavement and plunder. In this way, the national sovereignty and national independence of Asian member states are subjected to intolerable threats and damages.

    These cold facts cannot but have an impact on the Asian member states of the Manila Treaty. Thai newspapers openly criticized the United States for implementing policies that violated the Thai people's desire for peace, friendship, gaining the trust of neighboring countries, and improving the living standards of the people at home. Many Thai political activists have expressed dissatisfaction with American interference. Pakistani public opinion has raised increasingly sharp questions about whether pursuing a neutral policy is more wise than participating in military alliances or Western country blocs. The "Pakistan Times" soberly pointed out: "People in Pakistan who think seriously are now very clearly aware that alliance with the West has not brought any benefit to Pakistan. On the contrary, this alliance has placed Pakistan in all sorts of difficult situations and ruined the friendship of many countries."

    The economic difficulties of the Philippines, another Asian member state participating in this treaty, are also deepening. The enslavement and plunder carried out by the United States have aroused dissatisfaction among people in Philippine economic circles. The recently resigned Chairman of the Philippine National Economic Council, Montelibano, criticized the United States' policy as being based on "the greed of imperialists," and denounced the United States' attempt to "forever maintain a life of economic slavery" in the Philippines.

    The Karachi Conference not only faces the growing trend of peace and neutrality among Asian member states, but also faces the growing contradictions among Western member states. In the words of French Foreign Minister Pineau: "Despite the alliance, despite the vows, there is no real common policy of France, Britain, and the United States." This is entirely in line with the situation facing the Karachi Conference.

    At present, there is also the situation where, in order to conceal the aggressive nature of the Manila Treaty, to ease the opposition of the people of Asian countries, and of course also for the interests of certain member states themselves, the participants of the Karachi Conference emphasized that the focus of this conference should be on "economic and social aspects." After the Karachi Conference, Dulles will also visit many countries to perform the pose of the United States being Asia's "true friend." However, as the diplomatic correspondent of the London "Sunday Times" anxiously pointed out: "Asian public opinion is hostile to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the differences of opinion between Britain and the United States make it difficult to dispel the accusations of neutral countries by putting a beautiful coat of economic favors on this treaty."

    The facts of the past year have proved that the United States' attempt to pursue a "policy of strength" in Asia through the Manila Treaty and other military alliances has failed. The Karachi Conference certainly cannot save this fate.

### 喀喇蚩会议不能挽救“实力”政策在亚洲的失败

    喀喇蚩会议不能挽救“实力”政策在亚洲的失败
    “东南亚条约组织”理事会自去年2月间在曼谷举行第一次会议后，现在又在喀喇蚩举行第二次会议。从曼谷会议到喀喇蚩会议的一年间，国际局势起了巨大的变化。主张和缓国际紧张局势和用协商方式解决国际争端的“日内瓦精神”，主张和平共处和反对殖民主义的“万隆精神”，越来越深入人心；建立在拼凑军事集团和准备原子战争的基础上的“实力”政策，不断地遭到失败。这就使得马尼拉条约的策划者不能不日益陷于孤立和被动的地位。
    大家知道，马尼拉条约是美国在亚洲推行“实力”政策的一个重要工具。这个条约的矛头指向中华人民共和国和爱好和平的其他亚洲国家。这个条约具有镇压亚洲民族解放运动的鲜明的殖民主义性质。同时，这个条约还有另一个目的，就是阻挠日内瓦协议在印度支那三国的彻底实施。因此，这个条约从它成立的一天起，就受到亚洲各国人民的坚决反对。
    一年以来，这个侵略性的军事集团在美国的挟持之下，开了两次所谓“军事顾问会议”、两次所谓“参谋计划人员会议”和两次所谓“反颠覆活动会议”；还开了什么“军事情报机关首脑会议”、“后方勤务问题会议”、“武器标准化会议”、“军事训练和演习会议”等等一连串的会议。在喀喇蚩会议以前，美国还在暹逻湾和曼谷附近作了一次所谓“坚固的环节”的军事演习。美国力图“给东南亚条约组织”装上“牙齿”，显示“实力”，对亚洲国家进行恫吓，以便把亚洲一步步地推向战争的边缘。
    但是，实际情况的发展同华盛顿的主观愿望相反。
    中国、印度和缅甸三国总理所倡导的和平共处五项原则已在亚非会议上被亚非国家所接受，成为各国相互关系的基础，并在亚非会议的宣言中得到进一步的发展。越来越多的亚洲国家奉行和平中立政策，谴责美国的军事集团政策。
    美国企图把印度支那三国拖入东南亚军事集团的阴谋，也遭到了打击。柬埔寨拒绝马尼拉条约所给予的“保护”。老挝政府宣布愿意根据五项原则同邻国建立友好关系。由美国一手造成的南越局势，越来越严重地危害到有关各国的利益，因而引起了各方面的指责。
    马尼拉条约签订以来的事实说明，亚洲国家参加侵略性的军事集团不可能得到任何好处，而只能给他们带来了日益危险的后果。美国的军国主义分子在“防御”和“联盟”的幌子下，强使亚洲成员国承担加重人民负担以扩充军备的义务，承担拒绝同爱好和平的国家发展友好合作和加强经济文化联系的义务，承担让美国进行殖民主义奴役和掠夺的义务。这样，亚洲成员国的国家主权和民族独立就受到不可容忍的威胁和损害。
    这些冷酷的事实不能不在马尼拉条约的亚洲成员国中发生影响。泰国的报纸公开抨击美国执行违反泰国人民要求和平、友好、取得邻国信任和提高国内人民生活水平的愿望的政策。泰国许多政治活动家对美国的干涉表示不满。巴基斯坦舆论对执行中立政策是否比参加军事联盟或西方国家集团更为明智的问题，提出了日益尖锐的质问。“巴基斯坦时报”清醒地指出：“巴基斯坦认真思索的人们现在非常清楚地意识到，同西方结成联盟并没有给巴基斯坦带来任何好处。相反地，这种联盟使巴基斯坦陷入种种困难的境地，断送了许多国家的友谊。”
    参加这个条约的另一个亚洲成员国菲律宾，它的经济困难也正在日益加深。美国所进行的奴役和掠夺，引起菲律宾经济界人士的不满。刚刚辞职的菲律宾全国经济委员会主席蒙特利班诺，抨击美国的政策是以“帝国主义者的贪心为基础”，申斥美国企图在菲律宾“永远保持一种经济奴隶的生活”。
    喀喇蚩会议不仅面对亚洲成员国的日益增长的和平中立趋势，同时还面对着西方成员国之间日益发展的矛盾。用法国外长比诺的话来说：“尽管有联盟，尽管有誓言，并没有真正的法英美三国的共同政策。”这对于喀喇蚩会议所面临的情形，是完全符合的。
    目前还出现了这样的情形：为了掩饰马尼拉条约的侵略性质，为了缓和亚洲各国人民的反对，当然也为了某些成员国自身的利益，喀喇蚩会议的参加者强调渲染这次会议的重点应当放在“经济和社会方面”。杜勒斯在喀喇蚩会议后，还要访问许多国家去表演美国是亚洲的“真正朋友”的姿态。但是，正如伦敦的“星期日泰晤士报”外交记者焦虑不安地指出：“亚洲的舆论是敌视东南亚条约组织的，而且英美的意见分歧，想用给这个条约披上经济恩施的漂亮外衣的办法来解除中立国家的指责，是不容易的。”
    一年以来的事实证明，美国企图通过马尼拉条约和其他军事联盟在亚洲推行“实力”政策，已经遭到失败。喀喇蚩会议当然不能挽救这个命运。
