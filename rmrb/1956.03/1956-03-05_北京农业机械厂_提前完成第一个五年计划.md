Xinhua News Agency, March 4th. Today, the head of the economic planning section of the state-owned Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory reported to the factory director the results of their calculations: the entire factory has completed the first Five-Year Plan 1 year and 10 months ahead of schedule. From March 1955 to February 1956, the total value of the factory's output exceeded the original production value target for 1957 by 9%.

    The administrative head of the factory told our reporter: "After discussions among the staff and workers, this year's production plan is expected to be 90% higher than the 1957 target, exceeding the total output value of the past three years combined. This is because the staff and workers put forward more than 200 rationalization proposals during the plan discussions, and learned 27 advanced experiences from the Kaifeng Machinery Factory, such as electric welding and assembly line production of double-wheel double-shared plows." He also said that over the past three years, with the continuous improvement of production management and technical levels, production has increased rapidly. The total output value of the factory in 1955 increased by two times compared to 1952, and labor productivity increased by one time. Since the production of double-wheel double-shared plows began, costs have been reduced by 44.78%. In 1953, it took 36 hours to produce one double-wheel double-shared plow, but now it only takes more than 6 hours. This year, it is planned to further reduce it to 4 hours. In the past 3 years, the factory has also designed and produced 8 new products such as rocker-arm harvesters and grain combine harvesters.

    北京农业机械厂
    提前完成第一个五年计划
    新华社4日讯  今天，国营北京农业机械厂经济计划科长向厂长报告他们计算的结果：全厂已经提前1年另10个月完成了第一个五年计划。从1955年3月到1956年2月的12个月，全厂生产总值累计比原订要在1957年达到的生产总值超过9％。
    这个厂的行政负责人对本社记者说：“今年的生产计划经过职工讨论以后，生产总值预计要比1957年指标高90％，比过去3年生产总值的总和还多。这是因为职工在讨论计划中提出了两百多件合理化建议，并且学习了开封机械厂生产双轮双铧犁电焊和总装流水线等27项先进经验。”他还说，3年多以来，随着生产管理和技术水平的不断提高，生产迅速上升了，1955年比1952年的全厂生产总值增加了两倍，劳动生产率提高了一倍。生产双轮双铧犁以来，成本降低了44.78％。1953年生产一部双轮双铧犁需要36个小时，而现在只要6个多小时。今年还准备再降低到4个小时。3年来全厂还设计和生产了摇臂式收割机、谷物联合收割机等8种新产品。
