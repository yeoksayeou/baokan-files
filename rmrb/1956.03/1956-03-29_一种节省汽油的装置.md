A device to save gasoline has been successfully trial-produced at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Motor Vehicle Brigade and is already in use. This device is called a "water sprayer." It sprays a measured amount of clean water together with gasoline into the cylinder's combustion chamber, increasing the explosive force of the gasoline. With the "water sprayer" installed, a car can save 4.89 kilograms of gasoline per 100 kilometers, and the engine runs steadily and powerfully without knocking. The "water sprayer" can also lower the engine temperature, keep the parts clean, and extend the life of the car parts. The cost of manufacturing a set of "water sprayer" devices is only about fifteen yuan.

    一种节省汽油的装置
    一种节省汽油的装置，在鞍山钢铁公司汽车大队试制成功，并且已经开始使用。这种装置叫“喷水器”，它把定量的清水和汽油一起喷进汽缸的燃烧室，加大汽油的爆发力。安上“喷水器”，汽车每行走一百公里，可以节省汽油4.89公斤，而且发动机稳定有力没有爆震现象。“喷水器”还能降低发动机温度，使机件清洁，延长汽车机件的寿命。制造一套“喷水器”装置的成本只有十五元左右。
