    The US Threat to Cambodia
    Li Gao
    Recently, the borders of Cambodia have been constantly subjected to external threats. The troops and aircraft of the Ngo Dinh Diem group have continuously violated Cambodian territory, and have blockaded the border between South Vietnam and Cambodia, cutting off Cambodia's main transportation lines. The border between Cambodia and Thailand has also been blockaded by the latter.
    Cambodian newspapers have revealed that these actions threatening Cambodia are all occurring under the instigation of the United States, with the aim of forcing Cambodia to abandon its policy of peace and independence. Cambodian Prime Minister Sihanouk pointed out that the United States has played these tricks because his country pursues a neutral policy in world affairs. The United States does not conceal its conspiratorial intentions. The "Christian Science Monitor" of the United States openly stated on February 16th: "From Washington's point of view, the most advantageous situation would be for Cambodia to accept military assistance and training assistance like South Vietnam, and to stand firmly with the countries of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization group."
    In order to undermine the provisions of the Geneva Accords and turn Cambodia into a US military base and protectorate, the United States has put pressure on Cambodia more than once. As early as the Manila Conference in September 1954, the United States forcibly included Cambodia in the "protected" area of the Southeast Asia military group. However, Cambodian Prime Minister Sihanouk solemnly declared: "We do not accept this protection, because this protection is not honorable." The United States has also used so-called "aid" as a means to coerce Cambodia into accepting its enslavement and pull it into the Southeast Asia group. Sihanouk said in the Cambodian National Assembly on February 29: "The United States does not give us money because of Cambodia's neutrality" and "not accepting the conditions they put forward" and "not willing to follow them." This coercive tactic has been strongly opposed by the Cambodian government and people. Cambodia's expression of its intention to abide by the Geneva Accords and pursue a policy of peaceful neutrality is entirely in line with the national interests of Cambodia and the interests of peace in Indochina.
    However, the United States is even more dissatisfied with this. After the Karachi Conference, Dulles, on the one hand, greatly praised and supported the Ngo Dinh Diem group, which was implementing the US policy of undermining the Geneva Accords and clamoring to join the Southeast Asia military group, and on the other hand, showed its "teeth" to Cambodia, instructing the Ngo Dinh Diem group to take economic blockade and military threats against Cambodia in an attempt to force it to submit. These actions thoroughly exposed the colonialist aims of the United States in organizing the Southeast Asia military group. The aggressive spearhead of this military group is directed against all Asian countries that demand to maintain peace and their independent status.
    The threatening actions against Cambodia are not allowed by the Geneva Accords, which guarantee respect for the peace, independence and neutrality of the Indochina countries. These actions also violate the principles of maintaining peace and national sovereignty proclaimed by the Bandung Conference. The Chinese people and all countries and peoples who uphold the Geneva Accords and the Bandung Conference resolutions condemn this threatening behavior by the United States.

    美国对柬埔寨的威胁
    李高
    最近，柬埔寨的边境不断遭受外来的威胁。吴庭艳集团的军队和飞机连续侵犯柬埔寨领土，并且封锁了南越和柬埔寨的边境，切断柬埔寨的主要交通线。柬埔寨和泰国的边境，也被对方封锁了。
    柬埔寨报纸揭露，这些威胁柬埔寨的行动都是在美国指使下发生的，目的是想要迫使柬埔寨放弃它所执行的和平独立政策。柬埔寨首相西哈努克指出，由于他的国家在世界事务中执行中立的方针，美国就玩弄了这种手腕。美国也不掩饰它这种阴谋目的。美国“基督教科学箴言报”在二月十六日公开说：“从华盛顿的观点来看，最有利的情况就是要柬埔寨也像南越一样地接受军事援助和训练援助，同东南亚条约组织集团国家牢固地站在一起。”
    为了要破坏日内瓦协议的规定而把柬埔寨变成美国的军事基地和被保护国，美国对柬埔寨施加压力已不止一次了。早在1954年9月的马尼拉会议上，美国就曾强把柬埔寨划入东南亚军事集团的“保护”地区。但是，柬埔寨首相西哈努克严正地申明：“我们不接受这种保护，因为这种保护是不光荣的”。美国又曾以所谓“援助”的手段，要挟柬埔寨接受它的奴役，把它拉入东南亚集团。西哈努克二月二十九日在柬埔寨国民议会中说：“美国因为柬埔寨的中立”和“不接受他们提出的条件”，“不愿意跟随他们”，“他们就不给我们钱”。这种要挟手段，遭到了柬埔寨政府和人民强烈的反对。柬埔寨表示要遵守日内瓦协议，执行和平中立的政策，这是完全符合柬埔寨的民族利益和印度支那和平的利益的。
    但是，美国为此就更加不满。在喀喇蚩会议后，杜勒斯一面对执行美国破坏日内瓦协议的政策和叫喊要加入东南亚军事集团的吴庭艳集团大加赞赏和支持，另一面又对柬埔寨露出“牙齿”，指使吴庭艳集团对柬埔寨采取经济封锁和军事威胁，以图迫使它屈服。这些行动，彻底暴露了美国组织东南亚军事集团的殖民主义目的。这个军事集团的侵略矛头是针对一切要求维护和平和自己的独立地位的亚洲国家的。
    对柬埔寨的威胁行动，是保证尊重印度支那国家的和平、独立和中立地位的日内瓦协议所不能容许的。这种行动也违反了万隆会议所宣布的维护和平和民族主权的原则。中国人民和一切维护日内瓦协议和万隆会议决议的国家和人民，都谴责美国这种威胁行为。
