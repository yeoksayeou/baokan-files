Beijing Library has organized 500,000 volumes of books and periodicals that were previously boxed and stored outside the library, and placed them in the newly built six-story library building for readers to borrow.

Among a batch of uncatalyzed collections, the Beijing Library has completed the simple cataloging of 36,000 local chronicles, and also created provincial catalogs, which will be sent to relevant departments for research purposes. The organized books and periodicals include 180,000 copies of Chinese periodicals transported from Nanjing, Chongqing, Kunming and other places. In addition, 110,000 Japanese books and 150,000 Chinese books published before liberation have been initially sorted out.

The sorting out of this large batch of books and periodicals began in March last year. The Beijing Library plans to continue sorting out 1.4 million books this year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    北京图书馆整理出50万册书刊供读者借阅
    北京图书馆已经整理出过去装箱存放馆外的50万册书刊，装入新建的六层大书库，供读者借阅。
    北京图书馆在一批未编目的藏书中，已经完成了36，000册地方志的简单编目工作，并且还作出分省目录，准备送有关部门供研究上的参考。整理出来的书刊中，有从南京、重庆、昆明等地运来的18万册中文期刊。另外，还初步整理出11万册日文图书和15万册解放前出版的中文图书。
    这一大批书刊整理工作是在去年3月开始进行的。北京图书馆计划今年继续整理出140万册图书。　　　　　　（新华社）
