    500 Fat Pigs Fed With Substitutes
    By Our Correspondent Liu Xi
    The Guizhou Provincial State-Operated Dashui Farm has fed over 500 fat pigs entirely with substitutes for the past ten months, from May of last year to the present.
    In the past, Dashui Farm also relied on grain to feed pigs. During the fattening period, each pig had to be fed 2.5 to 3 jin of corn per day, resulting in the consumption of a large amount of grain and losses. Later, the responsible staff members of the farm seriously sought ways to open up feed sources and find substitutes for feeding pigs. At the beginning, they stir-fried some of the rice husks until yellow, ground them into flour, and mixed them with some oil cake (rapeseed oil cake) as feed. Because this feed was dry, the pigs had difficulty with bowel movements. They then collected over 1,200 jin of *Quercus fabri* leaves, boiled them, and mixed them in to feed the pigs, but the pigs still didn't like to eat them. At this time, someone objected, saying: "If you are reluctant to use golden soybeans, you won't catch a clever mandarin duck; if you don't feed them grain, the pigs won't grow." The responsible staff members of the farm criticized this erroneous statement. They checked the feed and found that the *Quercus fabri* leaves were not processed well enough, and were both astringent and bitter, so the pigs didn't like to eat them. So they re-boiled the *Quercus fabri* leaves, filtered out the bitter water from the leaves, and washed them with clean water. This time, the pigs liked to eat them. The six pigs they tried feeding with substitutes such as *Quercus fabri* leaves gained seventy or eighty jin each in three months, no less than pigs fed with grain.
    In 1955, Dashui Farm accepted the task of supplying 70,000 jin of pork to the market. At that time, some staff members worried that the pork from pigs fed with substitutes would not taste good and would not be sold in the future. To solve this problem, the farm slaughtered a pig, and the result proved that the meat was very delicious. Only then did everyone fully believe that pigs could be raised well without grain.
    Later, the number of pigs raised by Dashui Farm gradually increased to 500, requiring more than 10,000 jin of substitutes every day. It was difficult to solve the problem by relying on just one or a few substitutes. At this time, Huang Rong, a Communist Party member in charge of this work, learned from nearby agricultural cooperatives that substitutes such as fern roots and hostas could also be used to feed pigs. Fern roots grow mostly in shady and humid mountain areas and are available all year round. A laborer can dig 200 jin a day. Hostas bloom all over the mountains in summer and autumn and are good feed for pigs. They summarized and improved the farmers' experience, chopped and boiled the fern roots and other substitutes, processed and manufactured them, and mixed them with many other substitute feeds to feed the pigs. In this way, all kinds of nutrients were available, the nutrition was good, and the pigs had a good appetite and loved to eat.
    Dashui Farm uses forty or fifty kinds of substitutes to feed pigs. In order to overcome the difficulty of lacking substitutes in winter, last autumn they stored four or five hundred thousand jin of various substitute feeds, ensuring that there were substitutes to feed the pigs all year round. In the past ten months, they have saved a total of more than 200,000 jin of grain and more than 2,000 *shi* of bran.
    This year, Dashui Farm plans to raise 1,000 pigs and complete the task of supplying 150,000 jin of pork to the market.

### 用代用品喂了500只肥猪

    用代用品喂了500只肥猪
    本报记者　刘希
    贵州省地方国营大水农场，从去年5月到现在的十个月的时间里，全部用代用品喂了500多只肥猪。
    大水农场过去也是靠粮食喂猪。在育肥期间，每只猪一天要喂2斤半至3斤苞谷，结果消耗了大量的粮食，亏了本。后来场里的负责工作人员，便认真地想办法开辟饲料来源，寻找代用品喂猪。开始，他们把一部分谷壳炒黄，碾成面再混合一部分油枯（菜籽油枯）作饲料。因为这种饲料干燥，猪吃了大便不通，他们便采了1，200多斤青杠叶，煮熟了拌着喂，可是猪还是不喜欢吃。这时有人反对说：“舍不得金豆子，打不着巧鸳鸯；不喂粮食，猪长不成。”场里的负责工作人员批判了这种错误说法。他们检查了饲料，原来是由于青杠叶加工不够，又涩又苦，所以猪不喜欢吃。于是他们又重新煮了青杠叶，把叶子里的苦水滤去，用清水淘净，这样猪就喜欢吃了。他们使用青杠叶等代用品试喂的6只猪，3个月的时间都长了七、八十斤重，并不次于用粮食喂的猪。
    1955年，大水农场接受了供应市场7万斤猪肉的任务。当时有些工作人员又顾虑用代用品喂的猪，肉不好吃，将来卖不出去。为了解决这个问题，场里杀了一只猪，结果证明肉很好吃。这时大家才完全相信不用粮食也能喂好猪。
    后来大水农场喂的猪逐渐增加到了500只，每天需要1万多斤代用品，这样光靠一种或几种代用品是很难解决问题了。这时负责这一工作的共产党员黄荣到附近的农业社里了解到用蕨根、玉簪花等代用品也可以喂猪。蕨根多生长在阴湿的山林地区，一年四季都有，一个劳动力一天可以挖200斤，玉簪花在夏秋季节开得满山遍野，都是喂猪的好饲料。他们总结和提高了农民的经验，把蕨根等切碎煮烂，加工制造，和另外许多代用品饲料混合起来喂猪。这样各种养料都有，营养好，开口胃，猪非常喜欢吃。
    大水农场喂猪用的有四、五十种代用品。为了克服冬季缺乏代用品的困难，去年秋天，他们贮存了各种代用品饲料四、五十万斤，做到了一年四季都有代用品喂猪。十个月来，他们共节约了粮食20多万斤，糠2，000多石。
    今年大水农场计划喂1，000条猪，并完成供应市场15万斤猪肉的任务。
