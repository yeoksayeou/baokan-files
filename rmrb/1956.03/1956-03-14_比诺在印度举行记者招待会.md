Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 13th - French Foreign Minister Christian Pineau concluded his two-day meeting with Prime Minister Nehru on the 12th and left Delhi for Paris on the morning of the 13th.

Before leaving Delhi, Pineau held a press conference on the afternoon of the 12th.

At the press conference, Pineau said that he had discussed issues such as world peace, disarmament, and Indochina with Nehru. Pineau said he found the attitudes of the two countries very close and that he and Nehru held a "common attitude" on many issues. He also said that the two countries had decided to continue contact on these issues.

When talking about the issue of coexistence, Pineau said: "If we always say that coexistence cannot be achieved as long as certain problems are not resolved, then we will not achieve coexistence. If we acknowledge the possibility of coexistence, then we will create the necessary conditions for coexistence."

He said that he had indicated to Nehru that extensive contact between East and West could bring about changes in the situation through the exchange of cultural delegations, trade, exchange of technicians, and so on.

When talking about whether there had been any changes in French policy, Pineau said that France would maintain its friends and its alliances. At the same time, he also said that France was concerned that it would probably have to adopt some attitudes different from those France had adopted in the past few years and months.

Pineau also talked about the Indochina issue at the meeting. He said that he supported the suggestion of asking the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference to hold a meeting as soon as possible to discuss the current stalemate in Vietnam. In response to a question, he said that the current French government would not hastily withdraw its expeditionary force from South Vietnam at the request of the Ngo Dinh Diem government if other members of the Geneva Conference considered it necessary for the French expeditionary force to remain there for the implementation of the Geneva Accords. He said that France hoped that the provisions of the Geneva Accords would be fully implemented. France also hoped that the governments of South and North Vietnam would reach an understanding through "all possible means other than military" to implement the agreement.

According to reports in local newspapers, Pineau's talks with Nehru this time were held in a "more harmonious atmosphere" than Dulles' talks with Nehru. "The Statesman" pointed out that when Nehru and Pineau discussed the relationship between East and West in their talks, India's position was closer to France's view than the positions of the United States and Britain.

    比诺在印度举行记者招待会
    新华社新德里13日电　法国外交部长比诺在12日结束了他同尼赫鲁总理举行的历时两天的会谈，并且已经在13日上午离开德里前往巴黎。
    在离开德里前，比诺在12日下午举行了记者招待会。
    比诺在记者招待会上说，他同尼赫鲁讨论了有关世界和平、裁军和印度支那等问题。比诺说：他发现两国之间的态度十分接近，他同尼赫鲁在许多问题上抱有“共同的态度”。他还说：两国已经决定继续就这些问题进行接触。
    比诺在谈到共处问题时说：“如果我们总是说只要某些问题没有解决就不能实行共处，那么我们就不会实现共处。如果我们承认共处的可能性，那么就会创造共处所必要的条件”。
    他说，他已经向尼赫鲁表明，东西方之间的大量接触，是可以通过互派文化代表团、贸易、交换技术人员等等办法来促使情况有所改变的。
    比诺在谈到法国政策是否有所改变的时候说，法国将保持它的朋友和它的同盟。他同时又说：法国担心大概必须采取同法国在过去几年和过去几月中所采取的有些不同的态度。
    比诺在会上还谈到了印度支那问题。他说，他支持关于要求日内瓦会议两位主席早日举行会议讨论目前越南僵局的建议。他在回答问题的时候说，法国现政府将不按照吴庭艳政府的要求仓促地把它的远征军撤出南越，如果其他的日内瓦会议成员国认为法国远征军继续留在那里对日内瓦协议的履行是必要的话。他说，法国希望日内瓦协定的条款得到完全的履行。法国还希望南越和北越政府之间通过“军事以外的一切可能的方法”为履行协定达成谅解。
    据这里的报纸报道，比诺这次同尼赫鲁的会谈，要比杜勒斯同尼赫鲁的会谈“气氛更加和谐”。“政治家报”指出，在尼赫鲁同比诺在会谈中讨论东西方之间的关系的时候，印度的立场比美国和英国的立场更加接近法国的观点。
