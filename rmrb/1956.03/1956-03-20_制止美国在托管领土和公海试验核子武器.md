Stop the United States from Testing Nuclear Weapons in Trust Territories and on the High Seas

    Recently, the United States unilaterally decided to conduct nuclear weapons tests in the trust territory of the Marshall Islands and on the high seas of the North Pacific. The governments and peoples of Asian countries have expressed strong opposition to this. The Japanese people, who have suffered three times from U.S. atomic and hydrogen bombs, are particularly indignant at this U.S. behavior that threatens world peace and endangers the safety of the high seas. After holding the "Conference to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs" on March 1, the Japanese people have designated today as "Petition Day to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs," holding mass rallies and demonstrations across the country to intensify the mobilization of forces to stop the United States from testing atomic and hydrogen bombs and to oppose the U.S. atomic war threat.

    The U.S. testing of atomic and hydrogen bombs in trust territories and on the high seas of the North Pacific is a fundamental violation of international law. The basic purpose of the trusteeship system is clearly stipulated in the United Nations Charter. The UN Charter takes "to promote international peace and security" as one of the basic purposes of the trusteeship system. Article 76, Paragraph B of the UN Charter clearly stipulates: "To promote the political, economic, social, and educational advancement of the inhabitants of the trust territories, and their progressive development towards self-government or independence as may be appropriate to the particular circumstances of each territory and its peoples and the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned, and as may be provided by the terms of each trusteeship agreement." The United States' unilateral decision to conduct atomic and hydrogen bomb tests in the Marshall Islands trust territory is clearly a direct violation and destruction of the UN Charter.

    At the same time, these tests endanger vast areas of the high seas. International law strictly prohibits any country from excluding other countries and their nationals from all or part of the high seas and ruling them on its own. However, the United States has arbitrarily designated a vast "danger zone" of 375,000 square nautical miles in the Pacific Ocean around Eniwetok and Bikini Atolls in the Marshall Islands, prohibiting ships, aircraft, and personnel from other countries from entering. This clearly violates the basic principle of freedom of the high seas.

    The United States conducted an atomic weapons test in this area as early as 1954. The consequences of that test were that the residents of these islands suffered greatly; many residents have been permanently disabled, and more have been forced to abandon their homes and become displaced. At that time, all 22 fishermen on the Japanese "Lucky Dragon" fishing boat, who were fishing outside the "danger zone," were injured, and the income of many Japanese fishermen suffered huge losses. This barbaric atrocity by the United States on the high seas of the Pacific Ocean aroused public outrage and strong condemnation from Japan and countries around the world.

    The U.S. testing of atomic and hydrogen bombs in the Marshall Islands area is particularly unfavorable to Japan. Fishing is an important source of economic income for the Japanese people. The "danger zone" designated by the United States includes the best tuna fishing grounds near the Marshall Islands and cuts off the route for Japanese fishermen to the tuna fishing grounds off New Zealand and the Arafura Sea. At the same time, fishermen fishing outside this "danger zone" may suffer the same misfortune as the fishermen on the "Lucky Dragon" and are at risk of catching fish contaminated with radioactivity. Therefore, this illegal act by the United States on the high seas of the Pacific Ocean will not only seriously affect the income of many Japanese fishermen once again, but also threaten the safety of the lives of people in Japan.

    The purpose of the United States in testing atomic and hydrogen bombs on the high seas of the Pacific Ocean is to exacerbate the current international situation, flaunt its military force in front of the people of Asian countries, promote "deterrence," and create a tense atmosphere. This approach by the United States is the same as its recent large-scale military exercises in Bangkok and atomic war exercises on Iwo Jima.

    This U.S. behavior, which violates the safety of the high seas and threatens the peace and security of the entire Asia-Pacific region, has been met with increasingly strong condemnation from the people of the entire Asia-Pacific region and countries around the world. The Soviet and Indian representatives at the meeting of the UN Trusteeship Council have requested the Trusteeship Council to pay attention to this U.S. behavior that violates the UN Charter and to stop the U.S. from conducting atomic and hydrogen bomb tests in trust territories. The people and just public opinion of all Asian and Australian countries have expressed unanimous protests against this U.S. action that threatens the peace and security of all countries and violates international law.

    Therefore, the current renewed efforts by the Japanese people to launch a movement against U.S. atomic and hydrogen bomb tests are not only a just struggle to safeguard their own safety and interests, but also a just action to defend the peace and security of the entire Asia-Pacific region and uphold the principles of the UN Charter. The Japanese people's struggle is not isolated; it has the deep sympathy and support of the people of all countries in Asia and the world.

    The Japanese people have always bravely and unyieldingly persisted in their struggle against atomic and hydrogen bombs and against the U.S. atomic war threat. For many years, the movement against U.S. atomic and hydrogen bomb tests and against the U.S. turning Japan into a U.S. atomic war base has been developing on a large scale among the people throughout Japan. The most recent signature campaign launched in Japan to demand the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs has now collected 38.5 million signatures. This number of signatures is close to half of Japan's total population. The "Resolutions Demanding the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bomb Tests" passed successively by the House of Councillors and the House of Representatives of the Japanese Diet on February 9 and 10 also clearly reflect the will of the broad masses of the Japanese people. These facts powerfully demonstrate the firm and unwavering common will of the Japanese people to oppose atomic and hydrogen bomb tests and to oppose the U.S. atomic war threat.

    The Chinese people resolutely advocate the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs and advocate that atomic energy should be used for peaceful purposes. In a congratulatory telegram to the "Conference to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs" held in Tokyo, Japan, on March 1, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace stated: "The Chinese people are willing to work together with the Japanese people and peace-loving people all over the world to strive for the realization of the prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and universal disarmament, and to ensure world peace." The Chinese people believe that if the people of all countries take concerted action in the struggle against U.S. atomic and hydrogen bomb tests, they will be able to form a stronger moral force and frustrate the U.S. provocations that threaten peace and security.

### 制止美国在托管领土和公海试验核子武器

    制止美国在托管领土和公海试验核子武器
    最近，美国擅自决定要在托管领土马绍尔群岛和北太平洋公海上进行核子武器试验。亚洲各国政府和人民，对此已表示强烈的反对。曾经三次遭受美国原子弹和氢弹灾害的日本人民，对美国这种威胁世界和平、危害公海安全的行为特别感到愤慨。日本人民在三月一日举行“禁止试验原子弹和氢弹大会”之后，又定今天为“禁止原子弹氢弹请愿日”，举行全国规模的群众大会和示威游行，以加紧动员力量来制止美国试验原子弹和氢弹，反对美国进行原子战争威胁。
    美国在托管岛屿和北太平洋公海上进行原子弹和氢弹试验，是根本违反国际法的行为。关于托管制度的基本目的，在联合国宪章内已有明文规定。联合国宪章以“促进国际和平及安全”作为托管制度的基本目的之一。联合国宪章第七十六条第丑款更明确规定：“增进托管领土居民之政治、经济、社会及教育之进展，并以适合各领土及其人民之特殊情形及关系人民自由表示愿望为原则，且按照各托管协定之条款，增进其趋向自治或独立之逐渐发展。”美国擅自决定要在托管领土马绍尔群岛地区进行原子弹和氢弹试验，显然是对联合国宪章的直接违反和破坏。
    同时，这种试验使公海的广大范围遭受危险。国际法严格禁止任何国家在公海的全部或一部分排斥其他国家和国民而自行统治。但是美国在马绍尔群岛的恩纳威托克岛和比基尼岛周围的太平洋公海上，擅自划定一个广袤三十七万五千平方海里的“危险区域”，禁止其他国家船只、飞机和人员进入，这很清楚是破坏了公海自由的基本原则。
    美国在一九五四年就曾在这个地区进行过一次原子武器试验。那次试验的后果是，使这些岛屿上的居民蒙受巨大的痛苦，许多居民事实上已终生成为残废，更多的居民则被迫抛弃了自己的家园而流离失所。当时在“危险区域”以外捕鱼的日本“福龙丸”上的22个渔民全部遭到杀伤，并且使日本广大渔民的收入遭受巨大损失。美国在太平洋公海上的这种野蛮暴行，引起了日本和世界各国的公愤和严厉谴责。
    美国在马绍尔群岛地区进行原子弹和氢弹试验，对于日本是特别不利的。捕鱼是日本人民经济收入的一个重要来源。美国划定的这个“危险区域”，把马绍尔群岛附近的最优良的捕鲔场包括在内，而且切断了日本渔民通向新西兰和亚拉佛拉海海面的捕鲔场的航线。同时，在这个“危险区域”以外捕鱼的渔民，也有遭到“福龙丸”渔民那种不幸的可能，并有捕到沾染放射性的鱼的危险。因此，美国在太平洋公海上的这种不法行为，不仅将再一次严重影响到日本广大渔民的收入，而且使日本国内人民的生命安全也受到威胁。
    美国在太平洋公海上试验原子弹和氢弹的目的，是要加剧目前国际局势，在亚洲各国人民面前炫耀武力，鼓吹“威慑力量”，以制造紧张气氛。美国的这种作法，同它最近在曼谷举行的大规模军事演习，在硫黄岛举行的原子战争演习的用意是一样的。
    美国这种违反公海安全，威胁整个亚洲和太平洋地区和平和安全的行为，遭到了整个亚洲和太平洋地区以至世界各国人民越来越强烈的谴责。苏联和印度代表在联合国托管理事会的会议上，已要求托管理事会注意美国这种违反联合国宪章的行为，并制止美国在托管领土上进行原子弹和氢弹试验。所有亚洲、澳洲各国的人民和公正舆论，都对美国这一威胁各国和平安全，违反国际法的行动表示一致抗议。
    因此，目前日本人民再接再厉地展开反对美国试验原子弹和氢弹的运动，不仅是维护他们自身安全和利益的正义斗争，而且是对于保卫整个亚洲和太平洋区域的和平安全、维护联合国宪章原则的正义行动。日本人民斗争不是孤立的，它有着整个亚洲和世界各国人民的深切同情和支持。
    日本人民在禁止原子弹和氢弹，反对美国原子战争威胁的运动中，始终英勇不屈地坚持斗争。许多年来，反对美国试验原子弹和氢弹，反对美国把日本变成美国的原子战争基地的运动，一直在日本全国人民中大规模地发展着。最近一次在日本展开的要求禁止原子弹和氢弹的签名运动，到现在已经征集了3，850万个人的签名。这个签名人数已经接近日本人口总数的一半。日本国会参众两院在二月九日和十日先后通过的“要求禁止试验原子弹和氢弹决议案”，也十分清楚地反映了日本广大阶层人民的这种意志。这些事实，有力地显示了日本人民反对试验原子弹和氢弹，反对美国原子战争威胁的坚定不移的共同意志。
    中国人民坚决主张禁止原子弹和氢弹，并主张原子能应该用于和平的目的。中国人民保卫世界和平委员会在三月一日给在日本东京举行的“禁止试验原子弹和氢弹大会”的贺电中说：“中国人民愿与日本人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民一道，为实现禁止原子武器、氢武器和普遍裁军，确保世界和平而共同奋斗。”中国人民相信，各国人民在反对美国试验原子弹和氢弹的斗争中采取协同一致的行动，就能形成更加强大的道义力量，挫败美国威胁和平和安全的挑衅。
