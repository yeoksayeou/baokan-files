    据新华社平壤讯　中国人民志愿军政治部制定了“中国人民志愿军支援祖国农业合作化运动及农业生产，帮助朝鲜人民进行生产建设的实施方案（草案）”，并且在二十二日发出通知，号召全军实施这一方案。
    这个方案共十八条。在支援祖国农业合作化运动和农业生产方面，方案中提出：发动全军人员厉行节约，把节省下来的资财用于祖国社会主义建设。鼓励军官和士兵把个人节余的钱寄回家中，投入农业生产合作社，作为发展生产的资金。军官要踊跃认购国家每年发行的经济建设公债。要在部队中开展“爱国储蓄运动”。方案中还提出，要在三年中，由全军人员集资捐献三个拖拉机站；在部队中扫除文盲和推广汉语普通话等。
    在帮助朝鲜人民进行生产建设方面，方案中提出：各部队领导部门应和驻区附近的朝鲜地方政府联系，订出具体计划，积极帮助朝鲜人民进行生产建设。1956年全军要抽出六十万个劳动日，有计划地帮助朝鲜人民进行城市建设和农业生产，参加兴修水利、修路、开荒等工作。
