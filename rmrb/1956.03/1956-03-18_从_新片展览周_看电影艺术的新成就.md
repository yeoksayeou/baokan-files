    A Look at the New Achievements in Film Art from the "New Film Exhibition Week"
    By a Commentator of This Newspaper
    The ongoing "New Film Exhibition Week" is a concentrated showcase of excellent new films from 1955. These films mark a major step forward in China's film industry.

    In recent years, in order to overcome the situation where the film industry lagged behind real life and failed to meet the needs of the people, the Party and the government have taken many measures. These include strengthening leadership and promotion in all aspects of the film industry, especially in the creation of film scripts; increasing film production; advocating diversification in the themes, styles, and formats of film scripts; and, in addition to emphasizing works reflecting current real life, encouraging the production of adaptations of classical works and outstanding works since the May Fourth Movement. The Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture has held various professional conferences to promptly summarize and study various issues in film creation, and to gradually improve the ideological and artistic levels of film art workers.

    Facts have proven that these measures have brought a new look to our film industry. Film art workers have begun to break through the barriers of formulaic and generalized concepts, striving to depict typical characters in typical environments, so that the heroes of our times are vividly reproduced on the screen, rather than abstract, labeled "characters." The atmosphere of life in the films has become richer; the characteristics of film art have been developed more than in the past; and what is most exciting is the emergence of many new playwrights and actors, who have brought a vigorous and youthful spirit to our film art.

    The film "Dong Cunrui" marks a relatively high level of film art in our country in recent years. Through the depiction of Dong Cunrui's character, this film broadly reflects the spiritual outlook of revolutionary youth during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War. With a high degree of courage and self-sacrifice, they waged the most heroic and tenacious struggle against the enemy. The achievement of the film in shaping this heroic figure lies in the fact that it uses extremely realistic and moving artistic images to show the growth process of a true soldier under the education and encouragement of the Party. It shows how he became an immortal communist fighter from a rural youth.

    The success of the film "Dong Cunrui" also shows that Chinese filmmakers have reached a high level in terms of familiarity with the performance and techniques of filmmaking.

    The success of "Storm in South Island" proves that directors and actors who were previously less familiar with the struggles of workers, peasants, and soldiers have undergone great changes in their thoughts and feelings through practical experience in recent years. Coupled with serious research in artistic creation, they have been able to approach reality in embodying the content of the film and expressing the thoughts and feelings of the characters.

    "Mei Lanfang's Stage Art" records the artistic achievements of China's most outstanding dramatist and will become an excellent textbook for Chinese drama performance art.

    The "New Film Exhibition Week" marks several advances in China's film industry, which is the result of the hard work of all Chinese filmmakers. However, no achievement can be a reason for pride and complacency. We still need to make the following demands on our film art:

    First, regarding the issue of the quantity of films. In 1955, 18 feature films were produced, which is the highest annual output since 1950. However, this number is obviously far from meeting the cultural needs of our 600 million people. The Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture plans for film audiences to reach 1.2 billion this year, which means that each person watches an average of only twice a year. This is far from enough, and we need to greatly increase the quantity of film production.

    Second, the themes reflecting modern life need to be broader. Our film artists are relatively familiar with the themes of the struggles of the past revolutionary stages. There are still too few themes about the current real-life struggles, especially those reflecting socialist industrial construction. This shows that if film artists do not strive to become familiar with the current real-life struggles, they will not be able to quickly reflect the vigorous production and construction struggles that are currently underway in films. This is an issue that deserves serious attention.

    Third, artistic expression needs to be further improved. Our films still have the problem of characters not being fully portrayed and life being simplified. Taking the other two feature films in this exhibition—"Riding Lightly on the Angry Sea" and "Spring in the Water Village"—as examples, they are characterized by reflecting the current national defense struggle and the class struggle in agricultural cooperation. However, because filmmakers lack sufficient life experience in dealing with these themes, the films lack moving plots and character portrayals. Although the directors and actors have made their greatest efforts, there are still some traces of strain.

    If China's film art industry is to continue to maintain and improve today's level, film artists must become more familiar with the new, boiling life. Only by delving into new life and having a deep understanding of life can we truly reveal the contradictions and conflicts of the real struggle and create typical contemporary heroes.

    Fourth, the styles of film art need to be more diverse. In this exhibition week, our remarkable success in animation, puppet films, and landscape films is particularly noteworthy. But we need more diverse film styles, such as comedies, satires, musicals, biographies, sports films, etc., which are all wastelands waiting to be developed. The breadth of themes and the diversity of styles are necessary conditions for the prosperity of film art.

    For our directors and actors, a very important issue at present is to further improve their artistic level. Directors need to pay close attention to the characteristics of film, pay attention to guiding actors to realistically reproduce the thoughts and feelings of the characters, pay attention to the composition of the picture and the handling of the characters' environment and background, etc. These are all areas that we do not pay enough attention to now. The phenomenon of falseness in actors' performances is still a serious problem in our current films. Even in better films, it is inevitable. Some actors still try to perform characters from some stiff external movements, rather than deeply exploring the inner life of the characters, so that the characters' mental state is naturally revealed in the characters' actions. Failure to improve artistic level is a serious obstacle to improving the quality of film art.

    Let China's film art industry grow faster, let us fully cherish the achievements we have already made, and strive to overcome the weaknesses that still exist, so as to further improve China's film art industry on the existing basis!

    从“新片展览周”看电影艺术的新成就
    本报评论员
    正在举行的“新片展览周”集中地展览了1955年度优秀的新影片。这些影片标志着我国电影事业向前迈进了一大步。
    近年来，为了克服电影事业落后于现实生活和不能满足人民需要的状况，党和政府曾经采取了不少措施。这就是加强对电影事业各个方面、首先是电影剧本创作的领导和推动；增加影片的产量；提倡电影剧本的题材、样式和风格的多样化；除了重视反映当前的现实生活题材的作品外，也鼓励摄制改编古典作品以及五四以来的优秀作品。文化部电影事业管理局举行了各种专业会议，及时总结、研究电影创作中的各项问题，逐步提高电影艺术工作者的思想水平和艺术水平。
    事实证明，这些措施使我们的电影事业出现了新的面貌。电影艺术工作者开始突破了公式化概化念的障碍，努力描写典型环境中的典型性格，使我们时代的英雄在银幕上得到栩栩如生的再现，而不是抽象的、贴票签的“人物”；影片里的生活气息浓厚了；电影艺术的特性比过去得到较多的发挥；而最使人感到兴奋的是许多新的剧作者和演员的出现，他们为我们的电影艺术带来了一股蓬勃的朝气。
    影片“董存瑞”标志着我国近年来电影艺术的较高的水平。这部影片通过对于董存瑞的性格描写，概括地反映了我国抗日战争和解放战争中革命青年的精神面貌。他们以高度的勇敢和自我牺牲的精神，对敌人进行了最英勇顽强的斗争。而影片在塑造这个英雄人物的功绩上，便在于它是以极真实的、具体感人的艺术形象，显示了在党的教育和鼓舞下，一个真正战士的成长过程。显示出他怎样从一个农村少年成为共产主义的不朽的战士。
    “董存瑞”这部影片的成就，还说明了我国电影工作者在熟悉电影的性能和技巧方面，已经达到了较高的水平。
    “南岛风云”的成就，证明了原来比较不熟悉工农兵斗争生活的导演和演员，经过近几年来的生活实践，已经使他们的思想感情起了很大的变化，再加上艺术创造上的认真钻研，因而就能够在体现影片的内容和表达人物的思想感情上接近了真实。
    “梅兰芳的舞台艺术”纪录了我国最优秀的戏剧家的艺术成就，将成为我国戏剧表演艺术的优良的教科书。
    “新片展览周”标志着我国电影事业的若干进步，这是我国全体电影工作者辛勤努力的成果。但是任何成就不能成为骄傲自满的理由。对于我们的电影艺术，我们仍然需要提出下面的要求：
    首先，是关于影片的数量问题。1955年生产了18部故事影片，这是1950年以来产量最高的一年，但是，这个数字显然远不能满足我们的6亿人民的文化生活的需要。文化部电影局计划今年的电影观众达到12亿人次，也就是说，每个人一年平均只看两次电影。这是很不够的，我们还需要大大地增加影片生产的数量。
    其次，表现现代生活的题材方面还需要更广泛些。对于描写过去革命阶段的斗争生活的题材，我们的电影艺术家们是比较熟悉的。对于当前的现实斗争生活的题材，特别是表现社会主义工业建设的题材，现在还太少。这就说明，电影艺术家们如果不努力熟悉当前的现实斗争生活，就不能够使今天正在进行着的轰轰烈烈的生产建设斗争在影片上得到迅速的反映。这是一个值得严重注意的问题。
    第三，在艺术表现上，还需要进一步地提高。我们的影片，仍然存在着人物刻划得不够丰满、生活简单化的毛病。就以此次展览的另两部故事片——“怒海轻骑”和“水乡的春天”来说，它们是以反映当前的国防斗争和农业合作化中的阶级斗争为主题而显出特色的。但是由于电影艺术家们在处理这方面的题材的时候，还缺乏足够的生活基础。因而影片缺乏动人的情节，缺乏人物的描绘。虽然经过导演和演员的最大的努力，也还有一些捉襟见肘的痕迹。
    我国电影艺术事业如果要继续保持并且提高今天的水平，电影艺术家们就必须更多地去熟悉新的、沸腾的生活。只有深入新的生活，对生活进行深刻的认识和理解，才能够真正揭发现实斗争的矛盾和冲突，创造当代英雄人物的典型。
    第四，电影艺术的样式还需要更多样些。在这次展览周里，我们在动画片、木偶片、风景片方面的显著成功，是特别值得刮目相看的。但是我们还需更多样的电影样式，例如喜剧片、讽刺片、音乐片、传记片、体育片等等，都还是亟待开发的荒地。题材的广泛性和样式的多样性，是电影艺术繁荣的必要条件。
    对于我们的导演和演员来说，摆在目前的很重要一个问题，是进一步提高自己的艺术水平问题。导演们需要十分注意电影的特性，注意诱导演员真实地再现角色的思想感情，注意画面的构图以及人物的环境及后景的处理等等，这些都是现在我们注意得不够的地方。而演员表演艺术上的虚假现象，也仍然是我们目前影片中的一个严重问题。即使在较好的影片中，也在所不免。有些演员还是企图从若干生硬的外形动作上去表演人物，而不是深刻的发掘人物的内心生活，使人物的精神状态在人物的行动中自然地流露出来。艺术水平不提高，是提高电影艺术质量的严重障碍。
    让我国的电影艺术事业加快地成长吧，让我们充分珍视已经获得的成果，努力克服现在还存在的弱点，以便在现有的基础上，把我国电影艺术事业更加提高一步！
