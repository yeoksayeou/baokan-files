    Training Technicians for Coffee Cultivation
    In the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Region of Yunnan Province, the area planted with coffee this year has reached over 84,000 mu. By the end of January, the coffee seeds supplied to various locations in the autonomous region had been completely transported. To prepare for the task of planting a large amount of coffee this year, the Autonomous Region Government held a short-term coffee cultivation technical training class in late January, and has already trained 845 technicians. These technicians are all outstanding members of the Dai, Jingpo, Lisu, and Han farmers. After short-term training, they have mastered the techniques of planting coffee.

    培养种植咖啡的技术员
    云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治区，今年种植咖啡达84，000多亩。1月底，自治区供给各地的咖啡种已经调运完毕。自治区政府为了迎接今年大量种植咖啡的任务，于1月下旬开办了种植咖啡的短期技术训练班，已经培养出845名技术员。这些技术员都是傣族、景颇、傈僳和汉族农民中的优秀分子。他们经过短期训练后，已经能掌握种咖啡的技术。（云南日报编辑部）
