Xinhua News Agency, London - The British House of Commons debated foreign policy on the evening of the 27th. Robens, speaking on behalf of the opposition Labour Party, sharply criticized the British government's actions in international relations. Robens emphatically spoke about the peaceful coexistence of the communist and non-communist worlds. He pointed out that the British government was largely responsible for the failure of the Geneva Conference of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers to reach an agreement. He believed that the unfavorable outcome of this conference should serve as an impetus for further negotiations. Speaking of the German question, he stressed that the policies of Western countries have brought the solution of the German question to a standstill because they insist that a unified Germany join the North Atlantic Military Alliance. He criticized Britain's policy in the Middle East, arguing that the conclusion of the Baghdad Pact has exacerbated tensions in the region.

Robens also cited Khrushchev's report at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, reminding the House of Commons of the important role played by countries unwilling to participate in any military bloc in current international relations. He also believed that countries in the East and West could find a common basis starting from the United Nations Charter, so that the problems of Europe, the Middle East, and the Far East could be resolved.

In response, Foreign Secretary Lloyd tried his best to defend British foreign policy. When talking about the situation in the Middle East, Lloyd attacked Czechoslovakia's agreement to supply Egypt with weapons for defense, and then attempted to blame the Soviet Union for the fact that the German question has not yet been resolved and that no agreement has been reached on disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. However, he added that the British government is "ready to negotiate with the Russians at any appropriate time."

After Lloyd's speech, a debate unfolded, and many members of the House of Commons strongly demanded that the British government should adopt a policy that actively promotes agreements on pressing international issues.

Labour MP Henderson specifically asked the government to seriously study the Soviet Union's proposals on disarmament mentioned by Khrushchev in his report to the 20th Congress of the CPSU.

Labour MP Jennie Lee said worriedly that Britain's words had little effect on international affairs because everyone regarded Britain as America's lackey. She also suggested that Lloyd take measures to disband the "pathetic group" known as the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

Conservative MP Hinchingbrooke said that for the benefit of Britain, it would be better to formally recognize the German Democratic Republic and establish diplomatic relations with the German Democratic Republic.

Prime Minister Eden spoke last. When talking about the German question, he insisted that "the Western countries have never made the issue of restoring German unity dependent on whether Germany joins the North Atlantic Treaty Organization."

Referring to the Indochina issue, Eden said that the signatory countries of the Geneva Accords are now negotiating to decide what steps should be taken in the future.

When talking about the situation in the Middle East, Eden assured that the Western countries intend to conduct peaceful mediation. At the same time, Eden reiterated his adherence to the 1950 US-British-French "Tripartite Declaration" and would "try to increase troops" in the neutral zone.

Eden tried to portray British colonial policy as a good thing, and insisted that Britain was not a colonial country at all. Instead, he claimed that the Soviet Union was a colonial country.

Eden especially emphasized that he had carefully studied the materials from the 20th Congress of the CPSU. Eden said: "Since the two Soviet leaders have confirmed that they will visit our country in the spring, I think it is especially necessary for us to study these materials. They, like us, want to have a serious discussion at this meeting. Khrushchev said that he believes the danger of war has been reduced, and this is probably correct."

He said: "Our philosophies are at different poles, but this cannot be a reason why we cannot meet and cannot discuss issues together."

Eden emphasized: Identifying and exploring common ground is the task of politicians, and this is precisely the purpose of our meeting.

    英国下院辩论外交政策
    新华社据塔斯社伦敦讯　英国下院在27日晚上辩论了外交政策问题。罗本斯代表反对党工党发言，尖锐抨击了英国政府在国际关系方面采取的行动。罗本斯强调地谈到共产主义和非共产主义世界和平共处的问题。他指出，英国政府在很大程度上要对四国外交部长日内瓦会议没有达成协议这件事负责。他认为，这个会议的不顺利的结果应当作为进一步谈判的推动力。他在谈到德国问题的时候着重指出，西方国家的政策使德国问题的解决陷于僵局，因为它们坚持统一后的德国加入北大西洋军事联盟。他指责英国在中东的政策，认为巴格达条约的缔结加剧了这个地区的紧张局势。
    罗本斯还引证赫鲁晓夫在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会上的报告里面的话，提醒下院注意不愿意参加任何军事集团的国家在目前国际关系中所起的重大作用。他并且认为东方和西方的国家可以找到从联合国宪章出发的共同基础，这样一来，欧洲、中东和远东的问题就可以获得解决。
    外交大臣劳埃德在答复中竭力为英国外交方针辩护，劳埃德在谈到中东局势的时候攻击捷克斯洛伐克同意供给埃及用于防御的武器，然后又企图把到现在还没有解决德国问题和没有达成关于裁军和禁止原子武器的协议的罪过推在苏联身上。不过，他又说，英国政府“准备在任何适当的时间同俄国人进行谈判”。
    在劳埃德讲话后展开了辩论，下院的许多议员坚决要求英国政府应该采取积极促使在迫切国际问题上达成协议的政策。
    工党议员汉德逊特别要求政府认真研究赫鲁晓夫在苏共第二十次代表大会上报告中所提到的苏联关于裁军问题的建议。
    工党议员珍尼·李耽心地说，英国说的话在国际事务上的作用很小，因为大家都把英国看成是美国的小伙计。她还建议劳埃德采取措施，解散被称为东南亚条约组织的这个“可怜的集团”。
    保守党议员欣琴布鲁克说，为了英国的利益，不如正式承认德意志民主共和国，并且同德意志民主共和国建立外交关系。
    艾登首相最后讲话。他在谈到德国问题的时候硬说，“西方国家从来也没有使恢复德国统一的问题取决于德国是否参加北大西洋公约组织”。
    艾登谈到印度支那问题说，日内瓦协定各缔约国现在正在谈判以决定今后应当采取什么步骤。
    谈到中东局势的时候，艾登保证说，西方国家打算进行和平调解。同时艾登重申坚持1950年美英法“三国联合宣言”，并且要在中立地带“尽力增加军队”。
    艾登企图把英国殖民政策说成是好事情，并且硬说英国根本不是殖民国家。他却反而说什么苏联是殖民国家。
    艾登特别强调说，他仔细地研究了苏共第二十次代表大会的材料。艾登说：“由于两位苏联领导人确定在春天访问我国，因此，我认为我们特别有必要来研究一下这些材料。他们正如我们一样，想在这次会晤中认真地进行商讨。赫鲁晓夫说，他认为战争的危险已经减少了，这种说法大概是对的。”
    他说：“我们的哲学是处在不同的两极上，然而这不能成为我们不能够会晤和不能够在一起讨论问题的理由。”
    艾登强调指出：确定和探讨共同的基础是政治家的任务，这正是我们这次会见的目的。
