    Do Not Damage Young Trees
    Recently, when the Wudao Ku Forestry Bureau of the Yichun Forest Area in Heilongjiang Province used tractors to collect and transport timber, they often accidentally killed a large number of retained young trees. At the 503rd Logging Site of this bureau, 154 young trees were left on two hectares of logging area, but only 87 remained after tractor skidding. This phenomenon of damaging young trees will create obstacles to the natural regeneration of the forest.
    The problem of damaging young trees during tractor skidding can be solved. Li Xiaoxue and other advanced skidding tractor operators from the Youhao Forestry Bureau of Heilongjiang Province effectively prevented tractors from damaging young trees during skidding. Their experience is to strengthen the connection between tractor drivers and loggers, and to educate loggers to fell trees towards the tractor skidding path during timber harvesting, so that the tractor can easily transport the felled trees from the skidding path. During the collection and transportation of timber, tractor drivers and skidding personnel can also move the tractor closer to timber that is difficult to collect and transport, and then use winching, which can avoid damaging young trees by winching timber from a distance.

    不要毁坏幼树
    最近，黑龙江伊春林区五道库森林工业局在用拖拉机集运木材的时候，常常把保留下来的大量幼树给碰死了。这个局的503伐木场在两公顷的伐木迹地上留下154株幼树，但拖拉机集材后只剩下87株。这种毁坏幼树的现象会给森林的天然更新造成障碍。
    拖拉机集材中碰坏幼树的问题是可以解决的。黑龙江友好森林工业局先进的集材拖拉机手李小学等在集材中就有效地防止了拖拉机碰坏幼树的现象。他们的经验是加强拖拉机手和伐木工人的联系，教育伐木工人在采伐木材中把伐倒木倒向拖拉机集材道，以便于拖拉机从集材道上把伐倒木运走。在集运木材中，拖拉机手和集材员还可以把拖拉机靠近不好集运的木材，然后进行绞集，这样可以避免从远处绞集木材毁坏幼树的现象。
