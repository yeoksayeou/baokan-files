Telegram of Greetings from the Japanese Communist Party to the 20th Congress of the CPSU

To the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union

Dear Comrades! The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, on behalf of all members of our Party, extends warm fraternal greetings to the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. (Prolonged applause)

We also express warm respect to the Soviet people, who are closely united around the Communist Party and are victoriously building a communist society.

Our working people, along with all working people of the world, are closely watching the work of your Congress, the resolutions of which will not only have great significance for the Soviet people, but also for the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism throughout the world, and for the bright future of mankind.

The draft directives for the Sixth Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the Soviet Union, which your Congress is discussing, vividly illustrate the historically significant achievements of the Soviet people under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, as well as their further advance towards the construction of a communist society. The draft directives point out that the Soviet Union has all the necessary conditions to catch up with and surpass the most advanced capitalist countries in terms of per capita output within a historically short period.

The rapid progress of the Soviet Union on the road to communism makes the victory of the forces of peace over the “position of strength” policy increasingly realistic, and increases the confidence of more and more people around the world in the victory of socialism over capitalism. Many representatives of our working people and other strata have visited the Soviet Union. They have personally witnessed that the communist construction in the Soviet Union is inseparably linked with the cause of defending and consolidating world peace. These people’s accounts of the situation in the Soviet Union have played an important role in strengthening the sympathy and trust of the broad masses of the Japanese people towards the Soviet Union.

The visits of comrades N.S. Khrushchev and N.A. Bulganin to India, Burma, and Afghanistan have made a deep impression on the people of Asia and strengthened our people’s belief in the possibility of peaceful coexistence.

The victorious completion of the new Five-Year Plan will mean the further consolidation of the Soviet Union, the bastion of world peace. Today, the cause of world peace and progress cannot succeed without cooperation with the Soviet Union.

The American imperialists and the Japanese reactionaries are turning our country into a major military base for launching atomic and hydrogen bomb warfare against the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism. In Japan, which is subservient to American imperialism, militarism is being revived, and democratic freedoms are being subjected to increasing suppression. All of these are a direct challenge to peace in Asia and world peace, and a threat to the future of the Japanese people.

We will never allow this to happen. Our working class, together with the broad masses of the people, is resolutely opposed to military bases, to the manufacture, testing, and use of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and to the revival of militarism and the suppression of democratic freedoms. The Japanese working class and the masses of the people are intensifying their struggle for peace in Asia, for the independence of our motherland, and for democratic freedoms.

Our workers and all working people are actively engaged in a struggle to end the state of war between Japan and the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China, to re-establish normal diplomatic relations, and to further strengthen friendly relations with these two countries.

The Japanese Communist Party believes that its primary responsibility and most important task is to ensure that the Japanese people achieve victory in this struggle. Our Party is striving to accomplish this task, and based on its new program and the resolutions of the Sixth National Congress of the Party, it has strengthened its ranks and taken a step forward in the struggle to establish a national liberation democratic united front. In order for our cause to be victorious, we must unremittingly learn from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which has traversed a glorious path of struggle and victory.

The reason why the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is forever victorious is precisely because it creatively applies Marxism-Leninism in specific circumstances and is closely united around the Central Committee, which leads work according to the principle of collectivity.

We constantly learn from the experience of your great Party.

The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has great significance for our Party and our people. We wish the Congress success in its work.

Long live the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union! (Stormy applause)

Long live the Soviet people advancing along the road of building communism! (Stormy applause)

Long live the victory of the ideas of Marxism-Leninism! (Stormy applause)

Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Japanese and Soviet peoples!

Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party
First Secretary Nozaka Sanzo
February 1956

(Stormy and prolonged applause. All rise.)

    日本共产党致苏共代表大会的贺词
    致苏联共产党第二十次代表大会
    亲爱的同志们！日本共产党中央委员会代表我们党全体党员向苏联共产党第二十次代表大会致以热烈的兄弟祝贺。（经久不息的掌声）
    我们还向紧密团结在共产党周围和胜利地建设着共产主义社会的苏联人民表示热烈的敬意。
    我国劳动人民和全世界所有劳动人民一道正在密切注视你们的代表大会的工作，这个代表大会的决议将不仅对于苏联人民有巨大意义；并且对于全世界的和平、民主和社会主义事业，对于人类的光明前途，也有巨大意义。
    你们的代表大会正在讨论的苏联发展国民经济的第六个五年计划指示草案，生动地说明了苏联人民在苏联共产党领导下取得的具有世界历史意义的成就，以及他们向共产主义社会建设的进一步进军。指示草案指出，苏联具有一切必要条件，在历史上一个短时期内，在按照人口平均计算的产量方面赶上和超过最先进的资本主义国家。
    苏联在走向共产主义的道路上的迅速进展，使和平力量对“实力地位”政策的胜利愈来愈现实了，并且使世界上愈来愈多的人们增加了对于社会主义战胜资本主义的信心。我国劳动人民和其他各阶层的许多代表已经访问过苏联。他们亲眼看到苏联的共产主义建设是同保卫和巩固世界和平的事业不可分割地联结在一起的。这些人对苏联情况的叙述，对加强日本广大人民对苏联的同情和信任方面起了重要作用。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫和尼·亚·布尔加宁同志到印度、缅甸和阿富汗的访问，使亚洲人民得到深刻的印象，并且加强了我国人民对于和平共处的可能性的信念。
    新的五年计划的胜利完成，将意味着世界和平的堡垒——苏联的进一步巩固。今天，世界和平和进步事业如果不同苏联合作就不能成功。
    美帝国主义者和日本反动派正在把我们的国家变成对和平、民主和社会主义阵营发动原子弹和氢弹战争的主要军事基地。在屈从美帝国主义的日本，军国主义正在复活，民主自由正受到越来越大的镇压。所有这些都是对亚洲和平和全世界和平的直接挑战，是对日本人民前途的威胁。
    我们决不容许这种事情发生。我们的工人阶级同广大的人民群众一道，正坚决表示反对军事基地，反对制造、试验和使用原子武器和氢武器，反对复活军国主义和镇压民主自由。日本的工人阶级和人民群众正在加紧进行他们争取亚洲和平，争取我们祖国独立和争取民主自由的斗争。
    我国的工人和全体劳动人民正在为结束日本同苏联和中华人民共和国之间的战争状态，为重新建立正常的外交关系和进一步加强同这两个国家的友好关系而展开积极的斗争。
    日本共产党认为，它的首要责任和最重要任务是保证日本人民在这个斗争中取得胜利。我们的党正努力争取完成这个任务，它根据它的新纲领和党的第六次全国代表会议的决议，已经加强了它的队伍并且在为建立民族解放民主统一战线而进行的斗争中向前迈进了一步。为了使我们的事业取得胜利，我们必须坚持不懈地向已经走过了一条斗争和胜利的光荣道路的苏联共产党学习。
    苏联共产党之所以永远是胜利的，正是因为它在具体情况下创造性地运用马克思列宁主义和紧密地团结在以集体原则领导工作的中央委员会周围。
    我们经常学习你们伟大的党的经验。
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会对我们党和我国人民有着巨大的意义。我们祝代表大会工作胜利。
    光荣的苏联共产党万岁！（暴风雨般的掌声）
    沿着建设共产主义道路前进的苏联人民万岁！（暴风雨般的掌声）
    马克思列宁主义思想的胜利万岁！（暴风雨般的掌声）
    日本人民和苏联人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
                    日本共产党中央委员会
                    第一书记　野坂参三
                            1956年2月
    （暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声。全体起立。）
