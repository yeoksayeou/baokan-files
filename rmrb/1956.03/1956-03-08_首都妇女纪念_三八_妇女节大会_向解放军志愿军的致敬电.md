    Dear Commanders and Fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers:

    As the women of the capital joyfully commemorate the 1956 "March 8th" International Women's Day, we extend our cordial greetings and highest respects to you—the defenders of socialist construction and the protectors of the happy lives of women and children!

    Dear Comrades: Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of the whole country are actively engaged in socialist construction and socialist transformation, and have achieved great successes. These achievements are inseparable from your great contributions in defending the motherland. On the occasion of commemorating "March 8th" Women's Day, we express our deepest gratitude to you, and we will certainly work harder with the people of the whole city and the whole country for the socialist construction of the motherland, strive to be glorious active members and model figures in socialist construction, and use this to support your struggle to defend socialist construction!

    Let us work together in our different posts to build a socialist society, liberate Taiwan, and defend Asian and world peace!
          With Respects,
