    Ivory Carving of "Panoramic View of Beihai Park"
    A precious ivory carving - "Panoramic View of Beihai Park" was finally completed on the 22nd. The creation of this work of art took a total of one year and three months.
    This is the largest ivory carving in China's history. On a precious ivory tusk weighing 127 jin and measuring six feet five inches long, artists used three-dimensional carving, high relief, bas-relief, and openwork techniques to carve a beautiful panoramic view of Beijing's Beihai Park. In the park, more than 1,200 people are jubilantly celebrating the birth of the first Constitution of the People's Republic of China and the election of Comrade Mao Zedong as Chairman of the People's Republic of China. Here are parades with fluttering flags, people in various ethnic costumes dancing gracefully, young men and women beating waist drums, and mothers holding their children, leaning on railings and gazing at the yachts on the water. Under the White Pagoda, Young Pioneers wearing red scarves are listening intently to Liberation Army uncles telling stories. The entire Beihai Park is immersed in the joy of the festival. Nearly a hundred words of inscription are also carved on the ivory.
    This artwork was designed by Yang Shihui, a veteran artist from the ivory carving cooperative. Veteran artists Hu Fengshan, Yang Shizhong, and four skilled cooperative members, Ma Chun, Liu Rongchang, Liu Shuanggui, and Shi Changhai, all participated in the carving. They all have more than twenty years of carving experience. (Xinhua News Agency)

    象牙雕刻的“北海全景”
    一件珍贵的象牙雕刻——“北海全景”二十二日最后完工。这件艺术品的制作共花了一年零三个多月的时间。
    这是我国历史上最大的一件象牙雕刻，在一只重127斤、长六尺五寸的名贵象牙上，艺人们用立体雕刻、深浮雕、浅浮雕、镂空技巧雕刻着美丽的北京北海公园全景。公园里，一千二百多人在欢欣鼓舞地庆祝中华人民共和国第一个宪法的诞生和毛泽东同志当选为中华人民共和国主席。这儿有旗帜飘扬的游行队伍，有穿着各种民族服装婆娑起舞的人们，有打着腰鼓的男女青年，也有抱着孩子的妈妈们倚栏眺望着水面上的游艇。白塔下，系着红领巾的少先队员们出神地听着解放军叔叔讲故事，整个的北海都沉浸在节日的欢乐中。象牙上，还刻着将近一百个字的题词。
    这个艺术品是象牙雕刻社老艺人杨士惠设计的，老艺人胡凤山、杨士忠和四个技术熟练的社员马春、刘荣昌、刘双贵、石长海都参加了雕刻。他们都具有二十年以上的雕刻经验。（新华社）
