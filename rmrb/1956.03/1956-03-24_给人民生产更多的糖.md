Produce More Sugar for the People
By our reporter Lin Li

The Shunde Sugar Factory, located in Chengnan, Shunde, a place rich in sugarcane, and close to the quiet Desheng River, is one of the five major sugar factories in Guangdong. Before liberation, this factory could only produce 7,000 to 8,000 tons of sugar annually, with only one year reaching 12,000 tons. After liberation, thanks to the continuous improvement of the class consciousness of the workers, the sugar production has also increased year by year. By 1955, without increasing machinery and equipment and with a reduction of one-third in the number of employees, the sugar production still reached more than 36,000 tons. Because of this, when the central government began to call for striving to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, many leaders of the sugar factory thought that the factory was old, the equipment was outdated, and the production had exceeded any period in history, so the output could not be increased any further. Some people also thought that light industry did not play a decisive role in national industrialization, and it did not matter much whether the Five-Year Plan was completed ahead of schedule. The Party committee criticized these two ideas, pointing out that any enterprise should strive to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule in the shortest possible time, and that the potential of the Shunde Sugar Factory was still very large. Therefore, the factory leadership decided to complete the total output stipulated in the Five-Year Plan eight months ahead of schedule, and formulated three specific measures for this purpose. This was still decided at a meeting of cadres above the workshop director level, and had not yet been醞酿 and discussed by the broad masses of workers. The factory director said that according to past experience, as long as the masses are mobilized to discuss, the date for completing the Five-Year Plan can be brought forward.

The factory director's estimate was correct. When I visited Comrade Zhang Ming, the director of the pressing workshop, he replied without hesitation: "Our workshop has already made the decision to complete the task one year ahead of schedule." Zhang Ming is a labor model of the Shunde Sugar Factory. He has worked in the sugar factory for nearly twenty years and was promoted to workshop director two months ago. According to the original equipment efficiency, the pressing workshop could only press more than 1,000 tons of sugarcane per day, but with the efforts of Zhang Ming and others, the amount of sugarcane pressed daily has reached 1,600 tons, exceeding the equipment capacity by 600 tons. In order to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, Zhang Ming has put forward a preliminary plan to reform the machinery and equipment: the engine on the crushing machine, which originally had 15 horsepower, did not have enough power and affected the crushing efficiency, so it is planned to be replaced with a 25 horsepower engine; the speed of the sugarcane cutting knife will be changed from 426 revolutions per minute to 575 revolutions per minute; and the 32.1-inch diameter pressing roller will be changed to 32.6 inches. After these reforms, the amount of sugarcane pressed can be greatly increased, and the sugar production can be gradually increased. In the past, there were more shutdowns in this workshop. The shutdown time in the last pressing season accounted for eighty-two hours, and more than 5,500 tons of sugarcane were pressed less. Since the call to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule was put forward, no accidents have occurred in the first half of January, and 1,606 tons of sugarcane are pressed every day.

The equipment conditions in the refining workshop are relatively good, and it is the final process of sugar production. A large number of sugarcanes enter from the pressing workshop, and after passing through the refining workshop, they become white sugar and brown sugar. This workshop has already achieved some success in completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. According to the work plan, the sugar content of the boiled sugar in the first half of January should be 92.6%, and the actual completion was 92.71%. In the past, they only got 235 bags of sugar per tank, but now it has been increased to 250 bags. Chen Huishi, the director of the workshop, said that their sugar production in the first half of January was 130 tons more than the national requirement. It is estimated that the whole month can produce 240 tons more. Now, this workshop produces 197 tons of sugar per day, and will increase to 225 tons in March. The slogan of the refining workshop is: we can refine as much sugar as the pressing workshop can press sugarcane.

The Shunde Sugar Factory has an agricultural affairs section. It is responsible for technically guiding the planting, harvesting and transportation of sugarcane in nearby counties, and purchasing the sugarcane needed by the sugar factory. They are the bridge between the sugar factory and the farmers. In the process of completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, they are responsible for promoting fine varieties to sugarcane farmers and for technically guiding sugarcane production. Under their promotion and guidance, the sugarcane planting area in Shunde County has reached more than 186,000 mu, accounting for more than 26% of the county's cultivated land area. The average yield of sugarcane has increased to more than 8,000 jin per mu, and some high-yield fields have reached 22,000 jin. In order to better improve the unit area yield of sugarcane, and to meet the needs of the Shunde Sugar Factory, they are preparing to vigorously promote the early-maturing sugarcane just transplanted from India. The early-maturing sugarcane has been successfully trial-planted. It can mature one month earlier than ordinary sugarcane, and the average yield per mu can reach 30,000 jin. Promoting this variety can not only greatly increase the income of sugarcane farmers, but also prepare conditions for the sugar factory to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The sugarcane producing areas of Shunde County have completed the task of agricultural cooperation, which has laid the foundation for the promotion of early-maturing varieties and opened up the way for the sugar factory to complete the sugar production plan ahead of schedule.

    给人民生产更多的糖
    本报记者　林里
    顺德糖厂在盛产甘蔗的顺德城南，紧靠着静静的德胜江，是广东的五大糖厂之一。解放前，这个厂每年只能生产食糖七千至八千吨，只有一年达到一万二千吨。解放以后，由于职工群众的阶级觉悟不断提高，产糖量也逐年上升，到1955年，在机器设备没有增加，职工人数又减少了三分之一的情况下，产糖量还达到三万六千多吨。也因为这一点，在中央开始号召争取提前完成五年计划的时候，糖厂的不少领导人员以为厂子老，设备旧，生产又超过了历史上的任何时期，产量不可能再增加了。还有人以为轻工业对国家工业化不起决定作用，提前不提前完成五年计划关系不大。党委批判了这两种思想，指出任何一个企业都应该争取在最短的时间内提前完成五年计划，指出顺德糖厂的潜力还是很大的。于是，工厂领导上才决定提前八个月完成五年计划所规定的总产量，并且为此拟定了三项具体措施。这还是在车间主任以上的干部会议上决定的，还没有经过广大职工群众的酝酿和讨论。厂长说，根据以往的规律来判断，只要发动群众讨论，完成五年计划的日期还可以提前。
    厂长的估计没有错。当我访问压榨车间主任张明同志的时候，他就毫不迟疑地回答说：“我们的车间已经做了提前一年完成任务的决定。”张明是顺德糖厂的劳动模范，在糖厂工作将近二十年，两个月以前才被提拔为车间主任。按照原来的设备效能来说，压榨车间每天只能压榨甘蔗一千吨多一点，但是在张明等人的努力下，每天榨制甘蔗的数量已经达到一千六百吨，超过设备能力六百吨。为了提前完成五年计划，张明已经提出了改革机器设备的初步计划：打碎机上的发动机，原来是十五匹马力的，力量不够，影响打碎效率，计划换成二十五匹马力的；把切蔗刀的速度从每分钟426转改为575转；把直径32.1寸的压榨辘改为32.6寸的。经过这些改革，压榨甘蔗的数量就可大大增加，产糖量也就可以逐步上升。过去，这个车间的停车事故比较多，上一个榨期的停车时间，就占去了八十二小时，少榨五千五百多吨甘蔗。自从提出提前完成五年计划的号召后，一月上中旬没有发生任何事故，每天榨蔗1，606吨。
    制炼车间的设备条件比较好，是制糖生产的最后过程。大批甘蔗从压榨车间进去，经过制炼车间以后就变成了白砂糖和赤砂糖。这个车间在提前完成五年计划方面已经取得若干成绩。按照作业计划，一月上半月的煮得糖份应该完成92.6％，实际完成了92.71％。过去，他们煮糖每罐只得235包，现在已经提高到250包。车间主任陈诲诗说，一月上半月他们的产糖量比国家要求多了130吨。预计全月可以多产240吨。现在，这个车间每天产糖197吨，三月份将提高到225吨。制炼车间的口号是：压榨车间能够榨多少甘蔗，我们就能够制炼多少蔗糖。
    顺德糖厂有一个农务科。负责从技术方面指导附近各县的甘蔗种植、收割和转运，收买糖厂所需要的甘蔗。他们是糖厂和农民之间的桥梁。在提前完成五年计划的过程中，他们要负责向蔗农推广优良品种，要负责从技术上指导甘蔗的生产。在他们的推广指导下，顺德县的甘蔗种植面积已经达到十八万六千多亩，占全县耕地面积的26％以上。甘蔗的平均产量提高到每亩八千多斤，一些丰产田达到了二万二千斤。为了更好的提高甘蔗生产的单位面积产量，为了满足顺德糖厂的需要，他们准备大力推广刚从印度移植过来的早熟蔗。早熟蔗已经试种成功，它比一般甘蔗能够早熟一个月，每亩地的平均产量可以达到三万斤。推广这种品种，不仅可以大大地提高蔗农收入，而且为糖厂提前完成五年计划准备了条件。顺德县的甘蔗产地已经完成了农业合作化的改造任务，给推广早熟品种打下了基础，也给糖厂提前完成产糖计划开辟了道路。
