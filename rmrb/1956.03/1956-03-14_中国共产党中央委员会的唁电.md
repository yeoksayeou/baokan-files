Condolence Message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party:

    We are deeply saddened to learn of the unfortunate passing of Comrade Bolesław Bierut, First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, outstanding leader of the Polish working class, and dearest friend of the Chinese people. This is a great loss for the Polish people, and also a great loss for the Chinese people and all peace-loving people of the world. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people feel deep sorrow for the passing of this outstanding fighter of the international communist movement. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that the Polish people, under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, will surely inherit the great cause left unfinished by Comrade Bierut and advance more bravely and victoriously.
    We hereby send our condolences.

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
    March 13, 1956
