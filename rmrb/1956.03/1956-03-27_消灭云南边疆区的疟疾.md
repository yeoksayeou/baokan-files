    Eliminating Malaria in Yunnan Border Areas

    Xinhua News Agency: Yunjinghong, an ancient border town in Yunnan Province with subtropical scenery, is launching a massive campaign to eliminate malaria. Thousands of Dai, Hani, and Han people and cadres are braving the hot southern sun to clean up the environment. All ethnic groups have had their blood tested, and those with malaria parasites will regularly swallow preventive medicine free of charge.

    Yunjinghong is the seat of the People's Committee of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture and is the key experimental area for eliminating malaria in the autonomous prefecture. According to the plan formulated by the health department, malaria will be completely controlled this year and basically eliminated next year. The dozen or so flatlands in the autonomous prefecture will gradually eliminate malaria before 1960 based on Yunjinghong's malaria eradication experience. Malaria in the mountainous areas of the Wuliang Mountains and Nu Mountains within the autonomous prefecture will also be eliminated by 1962.

    消灭云南边疆区的疟疾
    云南省具有亚热带风光的边疆古镇——允景洪正在开展消灭疟疾的突击运动。成千的傣族、哈尼族、汉族人民和干部，冒着南方炎热的太阳，整理环境卫生。各族人民的血液都经过了检验，有疟原虫的人将定期免费吞食预防药。
    允景洪是西双版纳傣族自治州人民委员会所在地，是这个自治州消灭疟疾的重点试验地区。在卫生部门制定的规划中，今年内将彻底控制疟疾，明年基本消灭。自治州内的十几个平坝，都将根据允景洪灭疟的经验，在1960年前逐步消灭疟疾。自治州境内无量山余脉和怒山余脉等山区里的疟疾也将在1962年内消灭。（新华社）
