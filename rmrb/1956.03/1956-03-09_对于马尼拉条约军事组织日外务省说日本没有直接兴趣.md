Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 8th: Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman (Director of the Public Information and Cultural Affairs Bureau) Mitsuo Tanaka said at a press conference on March 7th that Japan has no direct interest in the Manila Treaty Organization as a military organization. Japan's current situation does not allow it to discuss military alliances and Asian "defense" issues.

Tanaka made these remarks when talking about the Manila Treaty Organization Council meeting held in Karachi and Japan's attitude towards the organization.

He said that Japan intends to strengthen its economic and cultural relations with Southeast Asian countries.

Agence France-Presse, quoting "well-informed sources," said that Tanaka's remarks reflect the widespread domestic opinion in Japan against sending Japanese troops abroad, and that Japan's current constitution prohibits Japan from sending troops abroad.

    对于马尼拉条约军事组织日外务省说日本没有直接兴趣
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本外务省发言人（情报文化局局长）田中三男3月7日在记者招待会上说，日本对于作为一个军事组织的马尼拉条约组织没有直接兴趣。日本目前的局势不允许日本讨论军事联盟和亚洲的“防务”问题。
    田中三男这番话是在谈到在喀喇蚩举行的马尼拉条约组织理事会会议和日本对这个组织的态度时说的。
    他说，日本打算加强同东南亚各国的经济和文化关系。
    法新社援引“消息灵通人士”的话说，田中三男的这番话反映出目前日本国内普遍存在的反对日本派军队到国外去的意见，目前日本的宪法也禁止日本把军队派到国外去。
