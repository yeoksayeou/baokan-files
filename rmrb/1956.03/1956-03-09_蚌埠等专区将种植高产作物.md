Bengbu and Other Regions to Plant High-Yield Crops

The Bengbu and Fuyang regions in Anhui Province, along the Huai River, will plant corn, a high-yield crop, on a large scale this year. The Bengbu region plans to plant more than 2.1 million mu of spring corn. The Fuyang region plans to plant 4.2 million mu of spring and summer corn, an increase of more than eight times the planting area of last year. In these two regions, corn usually yields more than 200 to 300 jin per mu, while planting mung beans, sorghum, and other crops only yields more than 100 jin. Currently, farmers in the two regions are actively preparing seeds and fertilizers.

    蚌埠等专区将种植高产作物
    安徽省沿淮河的蚌埠、阜阳两专区，今年将大量种植高产作物玉米。蚌埠专区计划种植春玉米210多万亩。阜阳专区计划种植春、夏玉米420万亩，比去年扩大种植面积8倍多。这两个专区种植玉米，一般每亩都可收到200多斤到300斤，种植绿豆、高粱等一般只能产100多斤。现在，两专区农民正在积极准备种子和肥料。
