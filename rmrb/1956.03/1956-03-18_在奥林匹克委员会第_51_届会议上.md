    At the 51st Session of the Olympic Committee
    International Olympic Committee Member from China, Dong Shouyi

    In January, I attended the 51st session of the International Olympic Committee held in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. After the meeting, I visited the 7th Winter Olympic Games held there.

    As the Chinese member of the International Olympic Committee, I am concerned about the Olympic movement, which was revived and developed under the initiative of the French educator Coubertin in 1894. I am also concerned about the importance attached to the development of sports in China. Therefore, I was deeply surprised when the 51st session began to discuss and approve the minutes of the 50th session held in Paris in 1955 and the joint meeting minutes of the International Olympic Committee Executive Committee and representatives of national Olympic committees. At that joint meeting, the representative of the Chinese Olympic Committee had requested the International Olympic Committee to revoke its recognition of the so-called "China National Amateur Athletic Federation" in Taiwan, and resolutely opposed the practice of dividing the Chinese Olympic Committee into two, which violates the Olympic Charter, on behalf of 600 million Chinese people. However, the second statement made by our representative on this issue was not recorded. This compelled me to speak out and request a fair supplement.

    Regarding the request to the International Olympic Committee to revoke its recognition of the so-called "China National Amateur Athletic Federation" in Taiwan, I distributed an open letter to my colleagues on the International Olympic Committee during the meeting, using the facts I had witnessed in my 40 years of sports work in China to prove to the members that this request was completely reasonable.

    China's national sports organization was founded in 1910. From then until 1948, it underwent several reorganizations. In 1924, China's national sports organization was recognized by the International Olympic Committee, and its name at that time was "China National Amateur Athletic Federation." In 1933, the "China National Amateur Athletic Federation" changed to electing representatives based on regions. In 1948, it even convened a representative conference, with more than 60 representatives from more than 30 provinces and cities participating. In 1949, the People's Republic of China was founded, and a small number of directors of the "China National Amateur Athletic Federation" fled to Taiwan, but the organization "China National Amateur Athletic Federation" remained in Nanjing. In October 1949, under the initiative of the majority of directors and supervisors of the original "China National Amateur Athletic Federation," the Chinese sports community held a national sports representatives conference in Beijing, deciding to reorganize the original "China National Amateur Athletic Federation" into the "All-China Sports Federation."

    The development history of China's national sports organization clearly shows that the only legitimate Chinese Olympic Committee representing the entire Chinese sports community is, and can only be, the "All-China Sports Federation."

    However, the International Olympic Committee recognizes the "All-China Sports Federation" as the Chinese Olympic Committee, and at the same time recognizes the so-called "China National Amateur Athletic Federation" in Taiwan. This is not in line with the spirit of the Olympic Charter.

    According to the Olympic Charter, only one national Olympic committee can be recognized in a country, and Taiwan is a historically recorded and universally recognized territory of China, a province of China. Its sports organization can only be subordinate to the Chinese Olympic Committee. Patriotic athletes and sports figures in Taiwan must also cherish the desire to participate in the ranks of the motherland's sports movement. Therefore, the Chinese people and athletes request the International Olympic Committee to revoke its recognition of the so-called "China National Amateur Athletic Federation" in Taiwan, avoid being influenced by the political factors of a certain country interfering in China's internal affairs, and uphold the just demands of the Olympic Charter.

    This open letter was taken seriously, but unfortunately, it was still not discussed at the meeting. This practice of ignoring reality and the reasonable demands of 600 million Chinese people is not commensurate with the spirit of promoting the Olympic movement.

    During this meeting, I had a beneficial conversation with the President of the International Olympic Committee, Mr. Brundage. I introduced the development of sports in China and the progress of the Olympic movement in China to Mr. Brundage.

    My introduction aroused great interest in Mr. Brundage. I presented him with some albums and pictures introducing the sports movement in New China. When he saw the architecture of the Beijing Gymnasium, he seemed to have some doubts. He asked, "Does China have a 50-meter indoor swimming pool?" When I gave an affirmative answer and explained that it was designed by Chinese engineers themselves, he was very surprised and praised the rapid development of sports in China.

    We also frankly discussed the issue of the Chinese people's request to revoke recognition of the so-called "China National Amateur Athletic Federation" in Taiwan. Mr. Brundage had different views from me. When he saw an open letter I prepared to distribute to the members of the International Olympic Committee, he also expressed different opinions. However, he said, "You can make a request saying that recognizing the China National Amateur Athletic Federation does not conform to the actual situation in China. This is not talking about politics."

    Although Mr. Brundage had different opinions and views, he could not but recognize this fact.

    At the 51st session of the Olympic Committee, issues related to the preparatory work for the 16th Olympic Games and the 8th Winter Olympic Games to be held in Squaw Valley, California, USA, in 1960 were also discussed.

    After the 51st session, we visited the 7th Winter Olympic Games.

    The 7th Winter Olympic Games was the largest Winter Games in history. This was not only because there were about 1,500 athletes from 32 countries participating in the competition, but also because there was a huge team of excellent athletes from the Soviet Union. It was the first time they participated in the Winter Olympic Games, making the Winter Olympic Games more symbolic of peace and friendship between people and young people of all countries in the world.

    The organizing committee of the games expressed its pleasure that our country could send an observer delegation to attend. Among the friends we met, they all warmly hoped that Chinese athletes could participate in the next Winter Olympic Games. We also told them that Chinese athletes will meet athletes from all over the world in the grand Winter Olympic Games in the near future.

    在奥林匹克委员会第51届会议上
    国际奥林匹克委员会中国委员　董守义
    1月间，我出席了在意大利科蒂纳·丹佩佐举行的国际奥林匹克委员会第51届会议。会后参观了在当地举行的第七届冬季奥林匹克运动会。
    作为国际奥林匹克委员会中国委员的我，一面关心着自1894年在法国教育家顾拜旦倡议下恢复和发展起来的奥林匹克运动，另一方面又关注着中国体育运动的发展所受到的重视。因此，在第51届会议开始讨论通过1955年在巴黎举行的第50届会议纪录和国际奥林匹克委员会执行委员会与各国奥林匹克委员会代表联席会议纪录的时候，使我深为惊讶。在那次联席会议上，中国奥林匹克委员会代表曾经提出要求国际奥林匹克委员会撤销对台湾所谓“中华全国体育协进会”的承认，并代表6亿中国人民坚决反对违反奥林匹克宪章，把中国奥林匹克委员会分成两个的做法。可是我国代表有关这一问题的第二次发言却没有纪录进去。这使我不能不发言要求作公正的补充。
    关于要求国际奥林匹克委员会撤销承认台湾所谓“中华全国体育协进会”的问题，在会议中，我曾分发了一封公开信给国际奥林匹克委员会的同事们，用我在中国从事体育工作40年间所见的事实向各委员证明，这个要求是完全合理的。
    中国全国性的体育组织成立于1910年。从那时起到1948年，前后经过数次改组。1924年，中国全国性体育组织被国际奥林匹克委员会所承认，当时它的名称是“中华全国体育协进会”。1933年，“中华全国体育协进会”改以地区为单位选举代表，1948年还召开了代表大会，共有30多个省、市的60多名代表参加。1949年，中华人民共和国成立，“中华全国体育协进会”少数理事逃往台湾，但“中华全国体育协进会”这一组织仍在南京。1949年10月，中国体育界在原“中华全国体育协进会”的多数理事和监事的发起下，在北京举行了全国体育界人士代表大会，决定将原“中华全国体育协进会”改组为“中华全国体育总会”。
    中国全国性体育组织发展的沿革，清楚地说明了，代表全中国的体育界的唯一合法的中国奥林匹克委员会就是，也只能是“中华全国体育总会”。
    但是，国际奥林匹克委员会承认了“中华全国体育总会”为中国的奥林匹克委员会，又同时承认台湾的所谓“中华全国体育协进会”。这是和奥林匹克宪章的精神不相符合的。
    根据奥林匹克宪章，在一个国家中只能承认一个国家的奥林匹克委员会，而台湾是见诸历史记载的、世所公认的中国的领土，是中国的一个省，它的体育组织只能隶属于中国奥林匹克委员会。在台湾的爱国运动员和体育界人士，也一定怀着参加祖国体育运动的行列的心愿。因此，中国人民和运动员要求国际奥林匹克委员会撤销对台湾的所谓“中华全国体育协进会”的承认，避免受到某一国家干涉中国内政的政治因素的影响，是维护奥林匹克宪章的正义要求。
    这一封公开信受到人们的重视，遗憾的是，会议上仍然没有予以讨论。这种无视现实和中国6亿人民合理要求的做法，同推动奥林匹克运动的精神是不相称的。
    在这次会议期间，我和国际奥林匹克委员会主席柏朗戴基先生进行了有益的交谈。我向柏朗戴基先生介绍了中国体育运动的发展和奥林匹克运动在中国开展的情况。
    我的介绍使柏朗戴基先生感到很大的兴趣。我赠送了一些介绍新中国体育运动的画册和图片给他。他在看到北京体育馆的建筑时，似乎有些疑问。他问：“中国有50公尺长的室内游泳池？”当我作了肯定的回答，并且说明是中国的工程师自己设计的以后，他很惊奇，同时盛赞中国体育运动发展的迅速。
    我们也坦率地谈到关于中国人民要求撤销承认台湾的所谓“中华全国体育协进会”的问题。柏朗戴基先生有和我不同的看法。他看了我准备分发给国际奥林匹克委员会委员的一封公开信时，也表示了不同的意见。但是，他说：“你可以提出要求说：承认中华全国体育协进会是不符合中国的实际情况。这样不是谈政治。”
    柏朗戴基先生虽然有不同的意见和看法，但也不能不承认这一个事实。
    在第51届奥林匹克委员会会议上，还讨论了有关第16届奥林匹克运动会筹备工作以及1960年在美国加利福尼亚州斯阔谷举行的第八届冬季奥林匹克运动会等问题。
    在第51届会议以后，我们参观了第七届冬季奥林匹克运动会。
    第七届冬季奥林匹克运动会是有史以来最大的一次冬季运动会。这不仅因为是有32个国家的1，500名左右的运动员参加比赛，而且是因为这里有苏联的优秀运动员的巨大的队伍。他们是第一次参加冬季奥林匹克运动会，使冬季奥林匹克运动会更富有象征世界各国人民和青年之间的和平和友谊的特色。
    运动会的组织委员会对我国能派出一个观察代表团出席表示高兴。在我们所遇见的朋友中，都热心希望中国运动员能参加下次冬季奥林匹克运动会。我们也告诉他们中国的运动员在不久的将来，会在盛大的冬季奥林匹克运动会中和世界各国运动员见面。
