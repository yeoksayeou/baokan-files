    Road Construction Should Not Hinder Spring Plowing
    In Fengshan County, Baise County, and Bama Yao Autonomous County, Guangxi Province, during the recent construction of the Bafeng and Bo'ai highways, many districts and townships mobilized most of the rural labor force to build roads, which hindered the current agricultural production. Water conservancy work in Fengshan County was mostly suspended due to highway construction. In Nanle Township, Second District, Baise County, more than 170 people used to work on water conservancy projects, but now there are only a dozen or so. The district originally planned to complete sixteen water conservancy projects before the rainy season, irrigating an area of one thousand mu, but now the completed water conservancy projects cannot even irrigate two hundred mu.
    These areas are now in the busy season for sowing corn and planting early rice, but only women with children are left at home, making it very difficult to do a good job in spring plowing production.

    修路不要妨碍春耕
    广西省凤山县、百色县和巴马瑶族自治县，在最近修筑巴凤和剥隘两条公路的时候，许多区和乡把大部分的农村劳动力动员去修路，以致妨碍了当前的农业生产。凤山县的水利工作，因为修筑公路而大部分被停顿下来。百色县二区南乐乡，过去修水利时出工170多人，现在只有十多人。这个区原计划在雨季前修好水利工程十六处，灌溉面积一千亩，而现在已修好的水利工程，还不能灌溉二百亩。
    这些地区现在正是玉米下种和早稻播种的大忙季，而留在家里的却只是一些带小孩的妇女，要搞好春耕生产是十分困难的。
