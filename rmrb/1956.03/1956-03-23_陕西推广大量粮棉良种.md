    Shaanxi Province is promoting a quantity of improved grain and cotton seeds far exceeding those of previous years.
    In the major cotton-producing areas of Sanyuan, Chang'an, Baoji, and 26 other counties, plans are underway to sow 500,000 mu of "517" improved cotton seed. The Shaanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative system has supplied 1.33 million jin of "517" cotton seed, which has now been completely shipped to the aforementioned counties and districts. The planting area of improved cotton seeds in the province is expected to reach about half of the total cotton area this year.
    Improved grain crop seeds are also being organized for transfer and adjustment in various localities. The amount of improved corn seeds promoted in 47 counties including Baoji and Ankang has reached more than 5.37 million jin, an increase of more than tenfold compared with last year. This year, Shaanxi Province is also promoting improved japonica rice seeds for the first time. One million jin of Yinfang japonica rice seed from Tianjin has been fully transported to the counties preparing for planting.

    陕西推广大量粮棉良种
    陕西省农村推广的粮、棉良种，数量大大超过往年。
    主要产棉区三原、长安、宝鸡等29个县计划播种“五一七号”良种棉花五十万亩。由陕西省供销合作社系统供应的“五一七号”棉种133万斤，目前已经全部调运到上述各县、区。今年全省良种棉花的播种面积预计将达到棉花总面积的一半左右。
    各地粮食作物良种，也正在组织调运和调剂。宝鸡、安康等47个县推广的玉米良种达到537万多斤，比去年增加十倍以上。今年陕西省还第一次推广了粳稻良种。从天津来的银坊粳稻良种一百万斤，已全部运到准备种植的各县。
