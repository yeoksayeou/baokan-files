    Strive to Connect with Reality
    Shixin
    If we compare the Shandong Dazhong Daily of recent times with the Dazhong Daily of three or four months ago, we will feel that this newspaper has made progress. A few months ago, when a surging agricultural cooperativization upsurge appeared in Shandong Province, the propaganda and reports of the Dazhong Daily lagged far behind reality. It neither fully reflected the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants and the huge momentum of the mass movement, nor provided timely and specific guidance for the current work. Since mid-November of last year, the Dazhong Daily has made significant changes in reporting on the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives, especially on agricultural production. Readers reflected: "Now the Dazhong Daily's reports on agricultural production are prominent and powerful," "The recent newspaper's guidance work is more timely, and everyone likes to read it." Not only the newspaper's agricultural propaganda, but also the propaganda on industrial production, the transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises, and the transformation of handicrafts have also been improved to varying degrees.
    The progress of the Dazhong Daily in recent months is the result of the editorial department overcoming conservative thinking, changing its style, and strengthening its connection with reality under the leadership of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China.
    Three or four months ago, the leading members of the editorial department had two ideas: One idea was that the cooperativization movement was developing so fast that the newspaper could not keep up; the other idea was that many cadres in the editorial department participated in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and it would be good enough to maintain the publication of the newspaper. These two ideas are actually one thought—a conservative thought of being content with the status quo. At the same time, the editorial department also had a work style that was divorced from reality. Taking cadres at the group leader level and above as an example, they rarely went to the countryside or factories in the past. Comrade Liu Jian, the editor-in-chief, had not been down since he came to work at the newspaper in 1952. This kind of situation of running a newspaper while sitting in the office did not change much even when a socialist revolution storm had already swept through the rural areas of Shandong. Without understanding the reality, it is of course impossible to reflect the reality and guide the reality well.
    In mid-November last year, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee severely criticized the newspaper and also put forward guidelines and methods for improvement. The editorial department of the Dazhong Daily also examined its conservative thinking and bureaucratic work style. From this time on, the editorial department began to organize business cadres to go to the countryside and factories to understand the actual work situation and problems, to consult the local party committees, and to learn from the broad masses. In the three months from November last year to January this year, the comrades in the rural group went to the countryside in a planned way four times: the first time to Dezhou, Liaocheng, Tai'an and other areas to understand the rectification of societies, the second time to the Liaocheng area to study agricultural production increase and other issues, the third time to the Dezhou area to understand the situation in cotton-producing areas, and the fourth time to the Tai'an area to study the issue of running advanced cooperatives. Many comrades from other groups also went to the countryside and factories. During this period, 42% of the editorial department's business cadres went down. The leading cadres of the newspaper played a leading role in this regard. For example, Comrade Liu Jian, the editor-in-chief, led the comrades of the rural group to the countryside twice, and Comrade Fang Zheng, the deputy editor-in-chief, also conducted investigations and studies on the transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises in some new and old joint state-private enterprises in Jinan City.
    After the editorial department strengthened its connection with reality, the newspaper indeed made progress in reflecting reality and guiding reality. The strengthening of commentary work is an important sign of this progress. In the recent period, the newspaper has published dozens of editorials on issues such as increasing agricultural production and rectifying and consolidating cooperatives. However, during the agricultural cooperativization upsurge last autumn, only three editorials on cooperativization issues were published in two or three months. The reason why there are more editorials in the newspaper is mainly because the editorial department has a better understanding and grasp of the actual work situation, and there are many problems in the actual work that need to be raised by the newspaper and need the newspaper to express its opinions. As a result, many commentary topics arose. The editorials "A Clear Contrast," "In Rectifying Cooperatives, Pay Close Attention to the Issue of Merging Societies," "Starting from the Fact That a District Party Committee Secretary's Family Did Not Join the Society," and "Accepting the Lessons of the Backward Winter Production in En County," published in January this year, were all issues that the editorial department learned from actual life and brought to the newspaper after analysis and research.
    Not only has the number of commentaries increased, but the content of the commentaries has also become more practical and specific than in the past. Taking the two editorials "A Clear Contrast" and "Accepting the Lessons of the Backward Winter Production in En County" mentioned above as examples, the former editorial commented on the good and bad of the well-digging work in Ziyang and Qufu counties from the perspective of leadership style and leadership methods; the latter editorial elucidated the principle that the Party must strengthen leadership over production and cannot abandon leadership through the fact that En County has basically achieved semi-socialist cooperativization, but winter production has not been done well. These two editorials have played a good role in promoting actual work. It is impossible to concretely praise or criticize the work of a county or the same work of several counties in the editorials like this without in-depth investigation and research. Taking another editorial on mobilizing agricultural cooperative members to invest as an example, an important point in this editorial is that as long as we closely combine production and combine the formulation of production plans to mobilize members to invest, it will be easy to make investment a conscious action of the masses. The editorial department was not clear enough about this point when it started drafting the editorial, but only became clear after investigation and research. In this way, this editorial gave rural cadres more practical help.
    The improvement of the work of the Dazhong Daily in this period is naturally not limited to commentary, and there have been many improvements in other aspects. As far as the entire newspaper is concerned, what to advocate and what to oppose is relatively clear. On the one hand, the newspaper widely and prominently publicized the enthusiasm and creativity of the people in building socialism; on the other hand, it conducted specific and sharp criticisms of ideas and things that were not conducive to socialist construction. For example, on the issue of increasing agricultural production, the newspaper not only powerfully criticized the small-scale peasant economy viewpoint and the conservative arguments such as "special conditions," "the masses have no habits," and "limited potential," but also vigorously publicized the creation, innovation, and experience of peasants in various places in production. The experiences of the Shiquan Lake Agricultural Cooperative in building mountainous areas, the experiences of the Song Changsheng Agricultural Cooperative in raising pigs and accumulating manure, and the experiences of the Zhang Shirui Agricultural Cooperative in improving agricultural technology reported by the newspaper have not only increased people's confidence in increasing production, but also taught people methods of increasing production, which has had a profound impact on the broad masses. Deeply excavating typical things in real life, both advanced and backward, and carrying out vigorous propaganda has made the newspaper take a big step forward in reflecting reality and guiding reality.
    After strengthening its connection with reality, the editorial department of the Dazhong Daily also often wrote the problems learned from real life into written reports and sent them to the provincial party committee or the relevant work departments of the provincial party committee for their reference. Sometimes, it also put forward beneficial suggestions to the leading organs based on the results of investigation and research.
    Due to more contact with reality and being educated by the masses' struggle, the editorial department has also improved in terms of ideological style. Taking the leading comrades as an example, after they personally went down to conduct investigations and research, they felt that their views on some issues were "solid," they were more confident in what the newspaper should advocate and what it should oppose, and they were more sensitive to new things. In this way, their leadership was also more specific. The general comrades also gained a lot in contacting reality. An editor in the literary and art group did not pay much attention to folk songs, folk rhymes, quick-patter talks, and other folk oral literature in the past. However, when he personally saw many rich quick-patter talks created by the peasant masses in the cooperativization upsurge in Taiqian Township, Shouzhang County, and learned about the influence and role of these quick-patter talks in the lives and struggles of the masses, his view changed. He not only collected some quick-patter poems and introduced them in the newspaper, but also drafted a commentary "Pay Attention to the Development of Folk Oral Literature," criticizing the phenomenon of neglecting and discriminating against folk oral literature.
    Of course, this approach of the Dazhong Daily is only the beginning, and the situation of propaganda lagging behind reality has not been greatly changed in some aspects. Therefore, the editorial department of the Dazhong Daily is not satisfied with the existing improvements, and they have decided to organize staff to contact reality in a more planned way. In the plans of the editorial department and various groups, plans for contacting reality have been formulated. For example, the industrial group stipulates that each editor should focus on contacting a factory or mine in Jinan City, go there at least once a week, make three or five friends in the factory or mine they contact, at least two of whom are workers; in addition, each editor should go to other places once every two months to understand the actual situation of industrial and mining enterprises in a timely and concrete manner, and strive to "share the fate and breathe the same air" with the broad masses of workers.
    Will the fact that the editorial department staff, especially the leaders, often go down affect the internal work? From the current point of view, internal work may be affected to some extent. However, according to the experience of the Dazhong Daily, this difficulty can be completely overcome. The way to overcome difficulties lies first of all in giving full play to everyone's work enthusiasm. In their case, when the editor-in-chief goes down, the deputy editor-in-chief takes his place; when the group leader goes down, the designated editor takes his place; when an editor goes down, another editor takes his place. Secondly, we must strengthen the planning of going to the countryside and factories, and the time for each person to go down each time should not be too long. In this way, the normal operation of internal work can be guaranteed. As for the fact that the editorial department can greatly improve the level of newspaper work after strengthening its connection with reality, that goes without saying.
    Contacting reality is not a new issue for our newspapers, but not all newspapers have solved this problem well. The situation that the editorial department of the Dazhong Daily did not have enough contact with reality in the past, especially the situation that the leaders were floating on the surface and rarely contacted reality, is by no means the situation of individual newspapers. This situation must be changed; as long as we break down conservative thinking and show the determination to improve our work, we can change it. The transformation of the Dazhong Daily is a vivid example.

    努力联系实际
    湜辛
    如果把最近一个时期的山东大众日报同三、四个月以前的大众日报比较一下，我们就会感到这个报纸有了进步。几个月以前，正当山东全省出现了汹涌澎湃的农业合作化高潮的时候，大众日报的宣传报道却远远地落后于实际，既没有充分反映出广大农民的社会主义热情和群众运动的巨大声势，也没有对当前工作进行及时的、具体的指导。从去年11月中旬以后，大众日报在报道整顿巩固农业合作社特别是报道农业生产方面有了比较显著的转变。读者反映：“现在大众日报对农业生产的报道突出有力了”，“最近报纸指导工作比较及时，大家也都喜欢看了”。不光是报纸的农业宣传，就是关于工业生产、私营工商业改造和手工业改造的宣传也有不同程度的改进。
    大众日报最近几个月来的进步，是编辑部在中共山东省委领导下克服保守思想，转变作风，加强同实际的联系的结果。
    三、四个月前，编辑部领导方面有两个想法：一个想法是，合作化运动发展得这样快，报纸是赶不上的；另一个想法是，编辑部中不少干部参加了肃反工作，能维持报纸出版就不差了。这两种想法实际上是一个思想——安于现状的保守思想。同时编辑部也存在着脱离实际的工作作风。拿组长级以上的干部来说，过去很少下乡下厂；总编辑刘建同志从1952年到报社工作以来就没有下去过。这种坐在机关里办报的情况，即使在山东农村已经掀起了社会主义革命的大风暴的时候也没有多少改变。不了解实际，当然不可能很好地反映实际和指导实际。
    去年11月中旬，山东省委对报纸进行了严格的批评，同时也提出了改进的方针、办法。大众日报编辑部也检查了保守思想和官僚主义作风。从这时候起，编辑部开始组织业务干部下乡下厂，了解实际工作的情况和问题，向各地党委请教，向广大群众学习。在去年11月到今年1月的3个月中，农村组的工作同志有计划地下乡就有4次：第一次是到德州、聊城、泰安等地区了解整社情况，第二次是到聊城地区研究农业增产等问题，第三次是到德州地区了解产棉地区的情况，第四次是到泰安地区研究办高级社的问题。别的组的同志，也有不少下乡下厂的。在这个期间，编辑部的业务干部下去过的达到42％。报社的领导干部在这方面起了带头作用，像总编辑刘建同志曾经两次带领农村组的同志下乡，副总编辑方正同志也曾在济南市的某些新、老公私合营企业中，对私营工商业的改造问题进行了调查研究。
    编辑部加强了同实际的联系以后，报纸在反映实际指导实际方面果然有了进步。评论工作的加强，就是这种进步的重要标志。最近一个时期报纸对农业增产和整顿巩固合作社等问题，发表了几十篇社论。可是去年秋天合作化高潮的时候，两三个月时间内只发表了3篇有关合作化问题的社论。报纸的社论多起来，主要是编辑部比较多地了解和掌握了实际工作的情况，实际工作中有许多问题需要报纸提出来，需要报纸发表意见。于是许多评论题目产生了。今年1月间发表的“鲜明的对比”、“在整顿合作社中，切实注意合并社的问题”、“从一个区委书记家庭不入社谈起”、“接受恩县冬季生产落后的教训”等社论，就都是编辑部从实际生活中了解到的问题，经过分析研究以后提到报纸上来的。
    不仅评论的数量增加了，评论的内容也比过去切实、具体了。拿前面提到的“鲜明的对比”和“接受恩县冬季生产落后的教训”两篇社论来说，前一篇社论是从领导作风和领导方法上来评论滋阳和曲阜两个县打井工作的好坏；后一篇社论是通过恩县虽已基本上实现了半社会主义合作化，冬季生产却搞得不好的事实，来阐明党对生产要加强领导而不能放弃领导的道理。这两篇社论对实际工作都起了很好的推动作用。而像这样在社论中具体地表扬或批评一个县的工作或者几个县的同一项工作，不经过比较深入的调查研究是不可能做到的。再拿一篇论述发动农业合作社社员投资的社论来说，这篇社论里有一个重要的论点，就是只要紧密地结合生产、结合制定生产规划来发动社员投资，就容易使投资成为群众的自觉行动。这一点编辑部在开始起草社论的时候是不够明确的，只是在经过调查研究以后才明确了。这样，这篇社论就给了农村干部比较切实的帮助。
    这一时期大众日报工作的改进，自然不限于评论，在其他方面也有不少改进。就整个报纸来说，提倡什么反对什么比较鲜明。报纸一方面对人民群众建设社会主义的积极性和创造性作了广泛的、突出的宣扬，另一方面，对不利于社会主义建设的思想和事物进行了具体的、尖锐的批评。例如在农业增产问题上，报纸不只是有力地批判了小农经济观点和“条件特殊”、“群众没有习惯”、“潜力有限”等等保守主义的论调，同时大张旗鼓地宣传了各地农民在生产方面的创造、革新和经验。报纸所报道的石泉湖农业合作社建设山区的经验、宋长生农业合作社养猪积肥的经验、张式瑞农业合作社改进农业技术的经验等，既提高了人们增产的信心，又教给了人们增产的办法，在广大群众中产生了深刻的影响。深入发掘现实生活中具有代表性的、先进的和落后的两方面的典型事物，进行有力的宣传，这就使得报纸在反映实际和指导实际方面前进了一大步。
    大众日报编辑部在加强了同实际的联系以后，还时常将从实际生活中所了解的问题写成书面报告送给省委或省委的有关工作部门，供他们参考。有时候还根据调查研究的所得，向领导机关提出有益的建议。
    由于更多地接触了实际，受到了群众斗争的教育，编辑部在思想作风方面也有了提高。拿领导同志说，他们在亲自下去进行调查研究以后，感到对一些问题的看法“扎实”了，对报纸应当提倡什么反对什么比较有把握了，对新事物比较敏感些了，这样，他们的领导也就比较具体了。一般同志在接触实际中也有很多收获。文艺组有一个编辑，过去对民歌、民谣、快板等民间口头文学是不大重视的。可是当他在寿张县台前乡等地亲眼看到农民群众在合作化高潮中所创作的许多内容丰富的快板，了解到这些快板在群众的生活和斗争中所产生的影响和作用，他的看法变了。他不但收集了一些快板诗在报纸上作了介绍，而且起草了一篇“要重视民间口头文学的发展”的评论，批判忽视和歧视民间口头文学的现象。
    自然，大众日报的这种作法还仅仅是开始，宣传落后于实际的状况，某些方面还没有得到很大的改变。因此大众日报编辑部并没有满足于现有的改进，他们决定更加有计划地组织工作人员接触实际。在编辑部和各个组的规划中，都制定了联系实际的计划。例如，工业组规定每个编辑人员在济南市有重点地联系一个厂矿，每周至少去一次，在所联系的厂矿中要交三、五个朋友，其中至少有两个工人；此外，每个编辑人员每两个月还要到外地去一次，以及时地具体地了解工矿企业的实际情况，力求做到和广大职工“共命运，同呼吸”。
    编辑部工作人员特别是领导人员常常下去，是不是会影响内部工作呢？从眼前看来，内部工作是有可能受到一些影响。但是根据大众日报的经验，这个困难是完全可以克服的。克服困难的办法，首先就在于发挥大家的工作积极性。在他们那里，总编辑下去了，就由副总编辑代替他的工作；组长下去了，就由指定的编辑代替他的工作；一个编辑下去了，就由另一个编辑代替他的工作。其次，要加强下乡下厂的计划性，每人每次下去的时间不要太长。这样，就可以保证内部工作的正常进行。至于编辑部加强了同实际的联系以后，可以大大提高报纸工作的水平，那就不必说了。
    联系实际对我们的报纸来说早已不是新的问题，但是并不是所有的报纸都已经很好地解决了这个问题。像大众日报编辑部过去联系实际不够，特别是领导人员浮在上面、很少接触实际的状况，决不是个别报纸的状况。这种状况是必须改变的；只要我们打破保守思想，拿出改进工作的决心，也是能够改变的。大众日报的转变就是一个活生生的例子。
