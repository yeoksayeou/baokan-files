    Striving to Eliminate Defective Products
    Hao Jie
    Since the State-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory held a signature rally at the beginning of January to eliminate defective cloth, the quality of its products has greatly improved. In the weaving workshop, in the past, there wasn't a single worker who could continuously produce defect-free cloth for a month. Now, there are four workers who have been producing defect-free cloth for more than fifty consecutive days. The first work area of the second shift, with a total of twenty-four people, produced no defective cloth for the entire work area for four days. In the past, the percentage of first-class products among the cotton cloth produced averaged only 98%, but now it has reached 99.9%, and the percentage of standard cloth has reached 100%. This is an unprecedentedly good phenomenon since the factory started operating more than a year ago.
    In order to produce more and better cloth, the workers of the Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory launched a labor competition centered on "comprehensively completing the plan and achieving a day's work without defective products." The fine spinning workshop proposed a competition to "achieve a day's work without producing bad yarn"; the weaving workshop proposed a competition to "achieve consecutive days of work without producing defective cloth." Wang Yunzhi, a weaving machine operator and a model worker in Beijing, made a commitment to "produce no defective cloth for one hundred days." Wang Xiufen, a cloth folding worker and an advanced producer of the factory, made a commitment to "produce no crease-marked defective cloth for three hundred days." Sun Hexiu, a weft loader, made a commitment to "not install a broken shuttle for two hundred days"... Under the initiative of the joint technical team of the steel combing workshop, the technical personnel of the entire factory formed joint teams by workshop to participate in the competition, and each person put forward personal competition guarantee conditions. All departments of the factory also proposed to launch a competition to "achieve a day's work without errors." The power workshop proposed to ensure safe power, water, and steam supply, and to ensure that the workshop has "fresh air, like spring all year round."
    In the month after the launch of the competition, the rationalization proposals put forward by the employees were equivalent to 60% of the total for the entire previous year. After the trial implementation of the new quality standards stipulated by the Ministry of Textile Industry, the requirements for product quality became stricter. Previously, double-weft cloth was not considered a defective product, but now it is. Therefore, the defective cloth rate once increased. To solve this problem, weaving workers, weft loaders, cloth folding workers, and deputy foremen of each shift held separate symposiums, and jointly put forward dozens of suggestions to reduce defective cloth. Technical personnel specially organized research groups, some responsible for finding book materials, and others for visiting and learning from brother factories. Technical management personnel also went deep into the workshops to understand the situation, and conducted measurements and analysis based on everyone's opinions. Finally, it was found that the reason for the double-weft defective cloth was continuous shuttle changing. Therefore, everyone tried to find a solution to the shuttle problem. Technical personnel Zhang Linghui proposed numbering the shuttles based on the experience of other factories. Deputy Foreman Yang Linhai also designed a "record card" so that weaving machine operators could record the numbers of faulty shuttles on the record card at any time, and the deputy foreman could inspect them on a rotating basis based on the record card. However, with more than a thousand looms and more than ten thousand shuttles, it would take six maintenance workers two months to number them all. How could they manage that? Everyone decided to work together, and as a result, they finished numbering them in three days. The six maintenance workers of the day shift formed a shuttle repair commando team, and in less than two weeks, they repaired all the faulty shuttles. Everyone also thought of many ways to repair the shuttles. Technical personnel Zhang Linghui proposed cutting and smoothing the air ring hook angle to prevent the weft yarn air ring hook angle from easily breaking. Technical personnel Li Rongping designed a set of double-weft automatic stop devices based on the experience of Tianjin Hengyuan Yarn Factory. The workers also installed weft feeler needles based on the experience of the State-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory. In this way, double-weft defective cloth was basically eliminated.
    To weave high-quality cloth, high-quality fine yarn is also needed. The workers of the weaving workshop held a joint meeting with the workers of the fine spinning workshop. The fine spinning workshop required the weaving workshop to do a good job in numbering (the yarn from which numbered machine is supplied to which numbered loom), and the weaving workshop required the fine spinning workshop to supply good yarn, and also helped the fine spinning workshop to display defective cloth, explaining the impact of yarn quality on weaving. The workers of the fine spinning workshop proposed to the weaving workshop: be sure to carefully tie the knots and eliminate large lumps. The workshop technicians and workers jointly developed a collector suitable for the factory's machines, which could collect the fibers of the cotton yarn, increase the strength of the cotton yarn, and greatly reduce the rate of white flowers and broken ends. Before using the collector, an average of fifty ends broke per thousand spindles per hour. After installing the collector, it was reduced to about thirty. The white flowers were also reduced from fourteen taels per machine to six taels. Artificial hairy yarn and rough-edged yarn were basically eliminated.
    The employees of the opening and cleaning workshop actively learned Wang Zhengqin's head-pressing method in the workshop, reducing the unevenness rate of cotton laps. They asked the leaders to reduce the unevenness rate index from the original 0.82% to 0.7%.
    The technical personnel of the spinning laboratory, which is responsible for inspecting the semi-finished products of each workshop, used to think that they were just inspecting and reflecting the situation. Now they put forward the slogan of "not letting defective products pass," and as soon as they find a defective product, they will not let it go, they will pursue it to the end until they find the reason.
    The employees of each workshop have tested their strength in the competition. Now they are full of confidence and are fighting tensely to comprehensively complete the plan and strive for more days of work without defective products.

    为不出次品而斗争
    郝洁
    国营北京第一棉纺织厂从一月初召开不出次布的签名大会以来，产品质量有很大的改进。织布车间过去连续一个月不出次布的工人一个也没有，现在已经有四个工人连续五十多天没出次布了。乙班第一工区共二十四人，有四天全工区没出一个次布。过去出厂的棉布上等品率平均只能达到98％，现在达到了99.9％，正布率达到了100％。这是开工一年多以来没有过的好现象。
    北京第一棉纺织厂的工人为了生产更多更好的布，开展了以“全面完成计划、不出次品工作日”为中心的劳动竞赛。细纱车间提出开展“不出坏纱工作日”的竞赛；织布车间提出开展“连续不出次布工作日”的竞赛。织布车间的挡车工、北京市劳动模范王云芝提出“百日无次布”的保证，折布工、厂的先进生产者王秀芬提出“三百天不出痕折次布”的保证，装纬工孙荷秀提出“二百天不装劈梭”的保证……全厂的技术人员在钢并粗车间技术人员联合小组的倡议下，以车间为单位组成联合小组参加竞赛，每个人都提出了个人的竞赛保证条件。全厂各科室也提出展开“不出差错工作日”的竞赛。动力车间提出安全供电、供水、供汽，保证车间“空气新鲜，四季如春。”
    开展竞赛以后的一个月，职工提出的合理化建议就相当于去年全年的60％。试行纺织工业部规定的新质量标准以后，对产品质量的要求严格了，以前双纬布不算次布，现在也算次布了。所以，次布率曾经一度提高。为了解决这个问题，织布工、装纬工、折布工和各班的副工长都分别召开了座谈会，共提出了几十条减少次布的建议。技术人员专门组织了研究小组，有的负责找书本资料，有的到兄弟厂去参观学习。技术管理人员也深入车间了解情况，根据大家的意见进行测定和分析。最后，找出了造成双纬次布的原因是因为连续换梭。于是，大家就在梭子问题上想办法。技术人员张令慧根据别厂的经验，提出把梭子编成号。副工长杨林海又设计出一种“记录卡片”，以便挡车工随时把有毛病的梭子的号码记在记录卡片上，副工长就可以根据记录卡片巡回地检修。但是，一千多台织布机一万多个梭子，如果要让六个保养工来编号就得两个月，这怎么来得及呢？大家决定一起动手，结果三天功夫就编好了。日班的六个保养工组成了一支修梭突击队，不到两个星期就把有毛病的梭子全部修理好了。大家也想了很多修理梭子的办法。技术人员张令慧根据纬纱气圈挂角容易拉断的现象，提出把气圈挂角切圆磨滑的办法。技术人员李荣平根据天津恒源纱厂经验，设计出一套双纬自停装置。工人们又根据国营北京第二棉纺织厂的经验安装上探纬针。就这样，基本上消灭了双纬次布。
    要织出质量好的布，还需要有质量优良的细纱。织布车间工人同细纱车间工人开了联合会议，细纱车间要求织布车间做好对号工作（几号车上的纱供给几号织布机），织布车间要求细纱车间供应好纱，并且帮助细纱车间展览次布，说明纱的质量对织布的影响。细纱车间工人向织布车间提出：一定要仔细结头，消灭大疙瘩。车间技术人员和工人共同研究出一种适用于本厂机器上的集合器，可以把棉纱的纤维集合在一起，增加棉纱的强力，大大减少白花和断头率。在没使用集合器以前，平均每千个纱锭每一小时要断五十个头，安上集合器以后，减少到三十个左右。白花也从过去每台车出十四两减少到六两多。人为的毛头纱、毛脚纱基本上被消灭了。
    清花车间的职工积极学习本车间王正勤的压头方法，降低了棉卷不均匀率。他们要求领导上把不均率指标从原来的0.82％降低到0.7％。
    负责检验各车间半成品的纺部试验室的技术人员，过去认为只是检查检查，把情况反映出来就行了。现在他们提出“不让次品过关”的口号，只要一发现次品，就抓住不放，一定要追到底，直到找出原因为止。
    各车间的职工在竞赛中考验了自己的力量。现在他们正满怀信心地为全面完成计划，争取更多不出次品的工作日而紧张战斗着。
