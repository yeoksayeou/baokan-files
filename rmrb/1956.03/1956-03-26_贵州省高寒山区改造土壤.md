Transforming Soil in High-Altitude Mountainous Areas of Guizhou Province

H章 County, Guizhou Province, is a high-altitude mountainous area where 30% of the land is sandy or barren, resulting in very low yields. To transform barren land into fertile land, the Chinese Communist Party Committee of H章 County, Guizhou Province, formulated measures and plans to improve the soil. They required that 40,000 catties of fertile mud be laid in each mu of sandy or barren land, and that all sandy and barren land be transformed into fertile land within three years. After this plan was issued, agricultural producers' cooperatives throughout the county launched a soil improvement campaign. In five days, Pingqiao Township transformed 410 mu of sandy and barren land. To date, the county has completed the transformation of more than 5,000 mu of land. This year, the plan is to improve a total of 55,000 mu of soil, which is estimated to increase grain production by more than 11 million catties after completion. (Li Yinghua)

    贵州省高寒山区改造土壤
    贵州省赫章县是一个高寒山区，有30％的土地是砂土和瘦地，产量很低。为了使瘦地变成肥地，中共贵州省赫章县委员会制定了改良土壤的措施计划，要求在每亩砂土、瘦地里铺垫进四万斤肥泥，三年内将全部砂土、瘦地改造成为肥沃的土地。这一计划下达后，全县的农业生产合作社展开了改良土壤运动。平桥乡五天内改造了砂土、瘦地410亩，到目前为止，全县已完成了五千多亩土地的改造工作。今年计划共改良土壤五万五千亩，完成后，估计可增产一千一百多万斤粮食。　（李应华）
