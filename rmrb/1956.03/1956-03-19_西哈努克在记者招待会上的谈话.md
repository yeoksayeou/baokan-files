Xinhua News Agency, 18th. According to a Reuters dispatch from Phnom Penh: Cambodian Prime Minister Sihanouk said at a press conference on the 17th that Cambodia is willing to invite leading politicians from all countries to visit Cambodia.

Sihanouk said that Mr. Nehru has already agreed to visit Cambodia in 1957, and Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai has also said that he will visit Cambodia, although the date of the visit is not yet known.

Sihanouk pointed out that although China is not a member of the United Nations, it is impossible to ignore it. He stated that despite some people's dissatisfaction with Cambodia selling rubber to China, Cambodia will continue to sell things to the highest bidder in accordance with commercial practice. Sihanouk also said that China has expressed its willingness to provide economic assistance without conditions and is prepared to participate in some of Cambodia's industrial projects. He said he is currently studying China's proposals.

    西哈努克在记者招待会上的谈话
    新华社18日讯　据路透社金边消息：柬埔寨首相西哈努克17日在记者招待会上说，柬埔寨愿意邀请所有国家的首要政治家访问柬埔寨。
    西哈努克说，尼赫鲁先生已经答应在1957年到柬埔寨访问，中国总理周恩来先生也曾经说他将访问柬埔寨，虽然还不知道访问的日期。
    西哈努克指出，中国虽然不是联合国的一个会员国，但是不理它是不可能的。他表示，尽管有人不满意柬埔寨要把橡胶卖给中国，但是，柬埔寨将继续照商业惯例把东西卖给出价最高的买主。西哈努克还说，中国已经表示愿意无条件地提供经济援助，并且准备参加柬埔寨的某些工业工程。他说，他现在正在对中国的建议进行研究。
