    First Automotive Works Machine Repair Shop Lathe Operator Hu Nianrong
    Improved Cutting Tools Completed Urgent Task on Time
Comrade Editor:
    Hu Nianrong, a lathe operator in our factory's machine repair shop, recently used his brains to improve cutting tools, improve work efficiency, and enable the urgent installation project to be completed on time.
    Not long ago, the through-type gas carburizing furnace installation project in the heat treatment workshop required 18 nickel-chromium-silicon heat-resistant steel pipes. Although the hardness of these steel pipe blanks was low, their toughness was very strong, making them difficult to process. In mid-December 1955, we assigned this task to the machine repair shop, and according to the installation progress requirements, it had to be completed before January 28 this year. However, when the workpieces were sent to the large-sized work section, many workers felt it was difficult and were unwilling to accept the task. The workshop leadership decided to hand it over to lathe operators Hu Nianrong and Wang Jiyi in the small-sized work section. They happily accepted the task.
    Wang Jiyi started processing first, and Hu Nianrong took over on the night shift. They continuously adopted several methods, but because the cutting tools often chipped or were severely worn, the processing efficiency was very low. From January 6 to 12, they only completed one-third of two pipes. Therefore, the section chief convened a meeting of veteran lathe operators in the workshop for research. Everyone put forward many methods, but none could effectively overcome this difficulty. In those days, Hu Nianrong was thinking day and night about how to overcome the difficulties. On January 13, a new processing method was finally devised. He drew a sketch of the improved cutting tool and consulted with the foreman, requesting the manufacture of a new tool bar with three cutting heads mounted on a circumference. The leadership decided to adopt Hu Nianrong's suggestion at that time. However, when work began with the newly made tool bar on the afternoon of January 14, the cutting head chipped again in less than half an hour. Hu Nianrong, together with the foreman and Wang Jiyi, etc., studied the issue further and found that the strength of the tool bar sleeve was insufficient, the wall was too thin, and it had not been heat-treated, so it could not withstand the strong vibrations. After clarifying these reasons, corresponding measures were taken immediately, and processing continued. A complete steel pipe was finished in 12 hours, and the inspection proved it to be qualified.
    After the successful trial production, Hu Nianrong continued to make five improvements with reference to Wang Jiyi's proposals. After this, the processing time was gradually reduced to 4 hours per pipe, and on January 19, it reached a maximum of 3 hours and 5 minutes. As a result, work efficiency was estimated to have increased thirty times, and 114 alloy cutting tools were saved. The above two items saved the country a total of 3,700 yuan.
    Hu Nianrong's initiative not only guaranteed the urgent needs of the installation project, but also opened up new avenues for processing such special steel in the future. His deeds have had a great impact on the factory's employees, which has powerfully dispelled the conservative thinking in people's minds. It tells us that as long as we give play to the spirit of initiative and break with convention, all difficulties can be overcome.

### 改进刀具按时完成了紧急任务

    为了提早完成第一个五年计划
    第一汽车制造厂机修车间车工胡年荣
    改进刀具按时完成了紧急任务编辑同志：
    我们工厂机修车间车工胡年荣最近开动脑筋改进刀具，提高了工作效率，使紧急的安装工程任务能够按时完成。
    不久以前，热处理车间的贯通式气体渗炭炉安装工程需要18根镍铬矽耐热钢管。这批钢管的毛胚硬度虽然低，但是韧性很强，很难加工。1955年12月中旬，我们把这个任务交给机修车间，根据安装进度要求，必须在今年1月28日以前完成。但是当工件发到大型工段的时候，不少工人都感到困难而不愿意接受这个任务。车间领导方面就决定把它交给小型工段的车工胡年荣和王继义加工。他们两个人愉快地接下了这个任务。
    王继义首先加工，胡年荣在夜班接替。他们连续采用了几种办法，但是由于刀具经常崩裂或者被磨损得很厉害，因此加工效率很低，从1月6日到12日只完成两根管子的三分之一。于是，工部主任召集了车间老车工开会进行研究，大家提出了很多办法，但都不能有效地克服这个困难。胡年荣在那几天，夜以继日地一直在考虑怎样想办法克服困难。到1月13日，新的加工方法终于想出来了。他划了一张改进刀具的草图，找工长商量，要求制造一个新刀杆，把3个刀头装在一个圆周线上。领导方面当时决定采纳了胡年荣的建议。但是，在1月14日下午开始用新作好的刀杆工作的时候，不到半小时，刀头又崩裂了。胡年荣再同工长和王继义等研究，发现原来是刀杆的套筒强度不够，壁太薄，又没有经过热处理，因而受不了强烈的振动。弄清了这些原因以后，随即采取了相应措施，又继续加工，在12小时内就全部车完了一根钢管，经过检验，证明合格。
    试制成功以后，胡年荣又参照王继义的提议继续做了5项改进。在这以后，加工时间逐渐缩短到每根4小时，到1月19日最高达到3小时零5分钟。结果，工作效率估计提高了三十倍，并且节省合金刀具114把。以上两项共为国家节约3，700元。
    胡年荣的创举，不但保证了安装工程的紧急需要，也为今后加工这种特殊钢材开辟了新的道路。他的事迹对全厂职工起了很大的影响，这有力地驱除了人们头脑中的保守主义思想。它告诉我们：只要发挥首创精神，打破常规，一切困难都是可以战胜的。
