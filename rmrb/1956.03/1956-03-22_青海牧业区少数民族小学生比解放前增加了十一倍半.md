In Qinghai's pastoral areas, there were only two elementary schools before liberation. After liberation, the number of schools increased year by year. By the end of 1955, there were 12 complete primary schools and 126 junior primary schools in the province's pastoral areas, with 7,949 students enrolled, of which more than 5,000 were ethnic minority students, an increase of eleven and a half times compared to before liberation. Counties such as Zeku, Tianjun, Nangqian, and Chengduo, where no schools had ever been established, now have elementary schools for ethnic minorities.

Qinghai Province will also widely establish tent and earthen house primary schools in pastoral areas. It is estimated that by 1957, the number of schools in pastoral areas will develop to around 300, with approximately 15,000 students enrolled.

    青海牧业区少数民族小学生比解放前增加了十一倍半
    青海省牧业区在解放前只有两所小学。解放后学校数逐年增加。到1955年底，全省牧业区已开办完全小学12所，初小126所，入学学生有7，949名，其中少数民族学生有5，000多名，较解放前增加十一倍半。从来没有设立过学校的泽库、天峻、囊谦、称多等县也都有了少数民族的小学。
    青海省还将在牧业区普遍设立帐房和土房小学。预计到1957年，全牧业区学校将发展到三百所左右，入学学生要达到一万五千名左右。
