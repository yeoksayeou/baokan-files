Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 2nd. Phnom Penh dispatch: Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia, delivered a speech in the National Assembly on February 29, expounding on the Cambodian government's domestic and foreign policies.

Sihanouk first discussed the Cambodian government's domestic policy. When talking about the economy, he pointed out that the main problem is agriculture. The fundamental issue is to solve the rice shortage, otherwise, we will starve, beg from foreign countries, and embark on the road to slavery. This is a dangerous path. Sihanouk also advocated establishing cooperatives to improve the people's lives. At the same time, the Cambodian government will convene people who understand industry to discuss how to make the country's industry progress and manufacture things that originally had to be purchased from abroad.

Sihanouk said that we will send people to China to discuss trade issues. Premier Zhou Enlai said that China will provide unconditional economic assistance to Cambodia.

When talking about Cambodia's financial difficulties, Sihanouk pointed out that we must now find ways to solve them, no longer rely on foreign countries, and not believe in foreign aid. The United States is unwilling to help us. If we only rely on aid, we will lose national sovereignty and independence. Sihanouk advocated reducing the army from 40,000 to 30,000 as a way to solve financial difficulties. He said that Cambodia's military expenditure accounts for 100% of the country's income. The total expenditure accounts for 162% of the country's income. He said that we can be unafraid of war, and we have friendly relations with various countries. We must believe in the policy of neutrality.

Sihanouk then talked about the plan for education and training the people. This plan advocates that people learn techniques such as construction and machine manufacturing to serve industry. Sihanouk believes that China's education system is worth learning from.

When talking about foreign policy, Sihanouk said that now Cambodia has joined the United Nations and adopted a neutral policy, established friendly relations with major countries such as China and India, and various major countries have recognized Cambodia.

Sihanouk talked about the relationship with China, saying that we once said that Cambodia cannot recognize China because there is still the Taiwan issue, and some powerful countries in the United Nations are currently protecting Chiang Kai-shek. If Cambodia establishes diplomatic relations with China, these powerful countries will think that Cambodia is not a neutral country. He also said that the Chinese side understands Cambodia's feelings. Premier Zhou Enlai once said to him that China always respects Cambodia. During his visit to Beijing this time, the Chinese side expressed satisfaction with Cambodia's neutral policy. The Chinese side also stated that if necessary, it will give Cambodia economic assistance.

When talking about the issue of Cambodia establishing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, Sihanouk said that it may take some time before he can make a decision on this issue.

Sihanouk said that the United States is dissatisfied with Cambodia because the People's Socialist Community is pursuing a neutral policy and does not accept the conditions they put forward. He pointed out that the United States has reduced its aid to Cambodia because of Cambodia's neutrality. The United States only helps those who follow them.

    西哈努克谈柬埔寨政府的内外政策
    新华社河内2日电　金边消息：柬埔寨王国首相西哈努克亲王2月29日在国民议会发表讲话，阐述柬埔寨政府的内外政策。
    西哈努克首先谈到柬埔寨政府的对内政策。在谈到经济方面时，他指出，主要是农业问题。基本上是要解决缺米的问题，要不然就要挨饿，就要向外国乞食、走上做奴隶的道路。这是危险的道路。西哈努克还主张成立合作社来提高人民的生活。同时，柬埔寨政府将召集懂得工业的人一起来讨论怎样使国家工业进步，来自己制造原来要向国外购买的东西。
    西哈努克说，我们将派人到中国去讨论贸易问题。周恩来总理说，中国将无条件地在经济方面给予柬埔寨帮助。
    西哈努克在谈到柬埔寨的财政困难时指出，现在我们要设法解决，不再依靠外国，不能相信外国的援助。美国不愿帮助我们，如果我们只依赖援助，就会失去国家的主权和独立。西哈努克主张把军队从4万名减少到3万名作为解决财政困难的一个办法。他说，柬埔寨用于军事方面的开支要占国家收入的100％。整个支出占国家收入的162％。他说，我们可以不怕战争，我们和各国有友谊关系。我们必须相信中立政策。
    西哈努克接着谈到教育和训练人民的计划。这个计划主张让人民学习建筑和制造机器等技术，来为工业服务。西哈努克认为中国的教育制度是值得学习的。
    在谈到对外政策时，西哈努克说，现在柬埔寨加入了联合国又采取了中立政策，和中国、印度等大国建立了友好关系，各个大国已经承认柬埔寨。
    西哈努克谈到对中国的关系说，我们曾经说过，柬埔寨不能承认中国。因为还有台湾问题，在联合国中的一些强国目前还袒护着蒋介石。如果柬埔寨和中国建立外交关系，这些强国将认为柬埔寨不是中立国家。他又说，中国方面是了解柬埔寨的心情的。周恩来总理曾对他说，中国随时都尊重柬埔寨。在他这次在北京的期间，中国方面对柬埔寨的中立政策表示满意。中国方面还表示，如果必要的话，将给柬埔寨以经济方面的援助。
    在谈到柬埔寨和苏联建立外交关系的问题时，西哈努克表示，可能要过一段时候，他才能就这个问题作出决定。
    西哈努克说，美国对柬埔寨表示不满。因为，人民社会同盟是追随中立政策的，不接受他们提出的条件。他指出，美国因为柬埔寨中立，减少了对柬埔寨的援助。美国只帮助那些追随他们的人。
