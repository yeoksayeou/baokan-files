    Sweet Potato Grafted on Moonflower Produces Asexually Hybridized Sweet Potato Seeds

    The Qinzhou Agricultural Technology School of Guangdong Province, using the "Wuyouji" variety of sweet potato, grafted it onto the rootstock of the purple moonflower, resulting in 3 asexually hybridized sweet potato seeds. Last summer, the school transplanted the seedlings grown from these seeds into the field. After 143 days of careful cultivation, one of the plants had already produced 116 sweet potatoes, weighing a total of 36 jin (approximately 18 kg). The characteristics of these sweet potatoes are a large number of individual potatoes, relatively thin tubers, adventitious roots growing from the nodes of the vines that also swell into tubers, flesh with purple spots, less fiber, and good quality. At the same time, five seedlings cut from this vine were cultivated, yielding a total of 30 jin of sweet potatoes, one of which produced 9 jin and 4 liang (approximately 4.7 kg), a twofold increase compared to the original "Wuyouji" variety. The preliminary results obtained from this experiment provide valuable material for future research using the Michurin method to study moonflowers and sweet potatoes without having to go through grafting every year, directly using seed propagation to obtain high yields.

    甘薯嫁接在月光花上结出无性杂交的甘薯种子
    广东省钦州农业技术学校，试用“无忧饥”品种的甘薯，嫁接在紫花月光花的枮木上，结出3粒无性杂交的甘薯种子。这个学校在去年夏季把这些种子的实生苗定植于田间，经过143天的细心培育后，其中有一株已经结得甘薯116个，共重36斤，这些甘薯的特点是个数很多，薯块较细，苗蔓节部所长出的不定根也能膨大成为薯块，薯肉带紫色斑点，纤维少，品质良好。同时在这株薯蔓中割出五枝苗子栽培，也总共结了甘薯30斤，其中有一株产薯达9斤4两，比原来“无忧饥”增产二倍。这个试验所获得的初步效果，对今后进一步采取米丘林方法，研究月光花和甘薯不必每年经过嫁接，直接采用种子繁殖以获得高额产量，提供了宝贵的材料。　（李少球）
