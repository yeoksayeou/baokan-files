    Shanghai Holds Quality Comparison Exhibition of Daily Use Industrial Products
    The Shanghai Municipal Third Commercial Bureau held the Shanghai Daily Use Industrial Products Quality Comparison Exhibition from February 18th to March 9th. More than 90,000 cadres and workers from various industrial sectors in Shanghai visited the exhibition. Many factory leaders and workers, upon seeing the relatively poor quality of their own factory's products at the exhibition, immediately took measures to improve quality.
    Currently, various purchasing and supply stations under the Third Commercial Bureau are formulating plans to improve commodity quality based on the opinions of the visitors.
