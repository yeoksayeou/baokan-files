Chongqing Cement Plant Continues to Set New Records

    Workers at the Chongqing Cement Plant have recently continuously set many new production records. Due to the kiln burners and cement mill workers actively studying advanced experiences such as the Soviet "rapid kiln rotation," No. 1 kiln and No. 1 cement mill alone have created 14 new records in the 47 days since January this year. By February 20, the average unit hourly output of three-quarters of the main machinery and equipment had exceeded the 1957 production level. Now, a socialist competition upsurge has been set off among the plant's workers, who have unanimously expressed their determination to strive to complete the tasks of the first Five-Year Plan faster and better than originally planned.

    重庆水泥厂连续创造新纪录
    重庆水泥厂职工最近连续创造了许多生产新纪录。由于烧窑工人和水泥磨工人积极学习苏联“快速转窑”等先进经验，单是一号窑和一号水泥磨在今年1月份以来的47天内就创造了14次新纪录。到2月20日止，四分之三的主要机器设备的平均单位小时产量，都突破了1957年的生产水平。现在，全厂职工掀起了社会主义竞赛的热潮，一致表示要争取比原订计划更快、更好地完成第一个五年计划期间的任务。 （本报驻重庆记者）
