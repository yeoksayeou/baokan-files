Agricultural Cooperatives Jointly Build Flood Diversion and Siltation Irrigation Canal
	The Dan River in Gaoping County, Shanxi Province, has historically been detrimental to agricultural production. In order to turn the water hazard into water conservancy, 34 cooperatives along the river have jointly built a flood diversion and siltation irrigation canal. This canal includes a main canal, branch canals, and distribution canals, totaling 128 *li* in length. Once completed, it can irrigate 27,000 *mu* of land. This is a picture of farmers building the Dan River flood diversion and siltation irrigation canal. (Photo by Zhang Ruihua, reporter from *Xinju She*)

    农业合作社联合兴修分洪淤灌渠
    山西省高平县的丹河历年为害农业生产。为了使水害变为水利，沿河的34个合作社联合起来，兴修一条分洪淤灌渠。这条渠包括干渠、支渠和斗渠共长128里，修成以后可以浇地二万七千亩。这是农民正在修丹河分洪淤灌渠。　新举社记者　张瑞华摄
