Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 15th: U.S. President Eisenhower stated at a press conference on the 14th that he believes the Cyprus issue is a dispute between friends of the United States. He said that the United States is prepared to take all steps to help resolve this issue reasonably, but the resolution of the problem should depend on the efforts of both sides.

Responding to a question about the situation in the Middle East, Eisenhower said that any deterioration of the situation in the region (which could lead to war) and the continuation of the Cyprus dispute would threaten the interests of the allies in the region. He added that the United States would rely on the United Nations and, if necessary, on the strength of the 1950 Tripartite Declaration to deal with the issue. He said that the United States is exploring all possible solutions and will take steps as soon as a decision is made.

Referring to the issue of international scientific and technological exchanges, Eisenhower said that if this refers to the exchange of information on peaceful science, rather than military secrets, and if such exchanges are conducted on an equal footing in the future, then he does not object to such exchanges.

    艾森豪威尔谈塞浦路斯等问题
    新华社16日讯　塔斯社纽约15日讯：美国总统艾森豪威尔14日在记者招待会上说，他认为塞浦路斯问题是美国的朋友之间的纠纷。他说，美国准备采取一切步骤来帮助合理解决这个问题，但是问题的解决应当靠双方的努力。
    艾森豪威尔在答复有关中东局势的问题的时候说，这个地区局势的任何恶化（这种恶化可能导致战争）以及塞浦路斯纠纷的继续，会使盟国在这个地区的利益受到威胁。他补充说，美国将依靠联合国，如果有必要的话，将依靠1950年三国宣言的力量来处理这个问题。他说，美国正探求一切可能的解决办法，一俟作出决定，即将采取步骤。
    艾森豪威尔在谈到国际科学技术交流问题的时候说，如果这指的是关于和平科学的情报交流问题，而不是军事秘密，如果这种交流将来是在平等的基础上进行，那么他并不反对这种交流。
