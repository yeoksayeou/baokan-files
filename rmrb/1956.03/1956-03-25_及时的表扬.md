    Timely Praise
    Recently, the Baotou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China promptly commended Chen Zhongshi, an intern technician, because he put forward a rationalization proposal that could save the country at least 30,000 yuan.
    Chen Zhongshi graduated from a technical school in August last year and has been doing design work in Baotou City. According to the design of the Shanghai Water Supply and Drainage Design Institute, twenty-seven septic tanks were to be built in the welfare area of the new urban area of ​​Baotou. During the design work, Chen Zhongshi felt that the septic tanks could be cancelled, but he was not very confident. Therefore, he worked hard to find Soviet building regulations. According to the regulations, he knew that the feces could be treated cleanly through the sewage treatment station, so that pipeline blockage would not occur. Later, he also paid attention to the Soviet-designed sewage treatment method for the factory area of ​​the new urban area of ​​Baotou and found that there were no septic tanks either. Therefore, he boldly proposed that since a sewage treatment station was to be established in the new urban area of ​​Baotou, the twenty-seven septic tanks could be cancelled.

    及时的表扬
    最近，中共包头市委及时表扬了一位实习技术员陈忠实。因为他提了一条合理化建议，可为国家至少节省三万元。
    陈忠实去年八月从专科学校毕业后就在包头市做设计工作。根据上海给排水设计院的设计，包头新市区的福利区要造二十七个化粪池。陈忠实在设计工作中，感到化粪池可以取消，但把握不大。于是，他就用功查找苏联建筑法规，根据法规，他知道粪便经过污水处理站，可以处理干净，不致发生管道堵塞现象。以后，他又注意苏联给设计的包头新市区厂区污水处理办法，发现也没有化粪池。因此，他便大胆地提出：包头市新市区既然要建立污水处理站，二十七个化粪池便可以取消。
