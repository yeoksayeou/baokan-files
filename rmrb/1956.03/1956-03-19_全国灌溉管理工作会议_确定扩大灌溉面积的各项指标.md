Xinhua News Agency, March 17th:

    The National Irrigation Management Work Conference proposed that this year the irrigated area will be expanded by 23.7 million mu due to strengthened irrigation management. The area implementing furrow irrigation, ridge irrigation, and shallow-water paddy field irrigation will increase by 154 million mu compared to last year, and the irrigated area using advanced Soviet planned water usage will increase twenty-four times compared to last year. The conference discussed various issues related to strengthening irrigation management and exchanged advanced experiences in irrigation management from various regions.
    Strengthening irrigation management and carrying out rational irrigation have a significant impact on ensuring increased agricultural production. According to reports from various regions, as long as irrigation management is strengthened, water is conserved, and rational irrigation is implemented, yields can generally be increased by 10% to 50% or more. At the same time, the potential of existing irrigation facilities in various regions is still very large. Materials submitted by various provinces during the conference show that as long as irrigation management is strengthened and slight improvements are made to existing projects, the irrigated area can be expanded by 100 million mu, accounting for 26% of the existing irrigated area.
    The conference also researched and discussed issues such as promoting planned water usage and the management of ponds, dams, and well irrigation. Preliminary plans were also made to combat soil salinization in irrigated areas. During the conference, Soviet experts Volonin, Zhukov, and Banin gave reports on Soviet irrigation management issues, the use of well irrigation, and methods for improving and preventing soil salinization.

    全国灌溉管理工作会议
    确定扩大灌溉面积的各项指标
    据新华社17日讯　今年全国因加强灌溉管理而扩大的灌溉面积达2，370万亩，实行沟灌、畦灌和水田浅水灌溉的面积将比去年增加15，400万亩，采用苏联先进计划用水的灌溉面积比去年增加二十四倍，这些指标是在17日闭幕的全国灌溉管理工作会议上提出的。会议对加强灌溉管理工作的各项有关问题都进行了讨论，并交流了各地灌溉管理的先进经验。
    加强灌溉管理进行合理灌溉，对保证农业增产的作用很大。根据各地汇报，只要加强灌溉管理、节约用水，实行合理灌溉，一般都能增产10％到50％以上，同时，各地现有灌溉设施的潜力还很大，会议中各省提出的材料表明：只要加强灌溉管理，对旧有工程略加改善，就可扩大灌溉面积一亿亩，占到现有灌溉面积的26％。
    会议对推行计划用水及塘坝、水井灌溉管理工作等问题都作了研究讨论，对战胜灌区土壤盐碱化也作出了初步方案。会议进行中，苏联专家沃洛宁、儒可夫和巴宁先后作了关于苏联的灌溉管理问题、利用茼井灌溉及土壤盐溃化改良及其防止办法的报告。
