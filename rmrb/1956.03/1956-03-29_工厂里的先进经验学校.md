    Advanced Experience School in Factories
    The Qingdao No. 3 State-owned Cotton Textile Factory recently opened an advanced experience school, with more than 400 workers participating in the learning. The task of this school is to systematically disseminate and promote advanced experience, enabling students to quickly reach the level of advanced producers.
    The school has four classes and eleven advanced experience promotion groups divided by workshops, with technicians serving as learning counselors. The learning method of each group is to first have advanced producers give lectures, introducing their operating methods, and then the counselors analyze and explain the experience of advanced producers from a theoretical perspective. Next, students observe on-site, hold discussions, examine their own operations in light of the experience of advanced producers, and develop improvement plans.
    Each advanced experience promotion group has started classes one after another. In the week before learning, the average end breakage rate of the first work area of ​​Class C was 54.19%; in the week after learning, it increased to 60.83%. (Xinhua News Agency)

    学校设有四个班部，以车间为单位划分了十一个先进经验推广小组，由技术人员担任学习辅导员。各组学习的方法是每课先由先进生产者讲课，介绍自己的操作方法，然后由辅导员把先进生产者的经验提高到理论上来分析说明。接着学员再到现场观摩，进行座谈，对照先进生产者的经验检查自己的操作，订出改进计划。
