Yunnan Province to Universally Plant Double-Season Rice This Year

    In the flatland areas of the Lancang Lahu Autonomous County of Yunnan, before the Spring Festival, five districts had already planted 2,400 jin of double-season rice; in some places, the seedlings have already grown very tall. Yuanjiang, Jingdong, Pu'er and other counties have already sown the first crop of double-season rice, and Jingdong, Pu'er, and Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, which planted earlier, have already transplanted seedlings.

    Yunnan Province will universally plant double-season rice this year, with Yuxi Prefecture alone planting 185,000 mu. In addition to universally planting double-season rice, Yuanjiang County in this prefecture will also experiment with planting three seasons of rice in areas where double-season rice is already planted; the county will create 23 "thousand-jin townships" this year. Furthermore, Yuxi, Jiangchuan, Chengjiang, Chenggong, Jinning and other five counties will become "thousand-jin counties" this year due to the planting of double-season rice.

    云南省今年将普遍栽种双季稻
    在云南的澜沧拉祜族自治区的平坝地区，春节以前已有五个区下种双季稻2，400斤；有些地方的秧苗已经长的很高了。元江、景东、普洱等县已经播下双季稻第一季稻，播种较早的景东、普洱、西双版纳傣族自治州已经移植秧苗。
    云南省今年将普遍栽种双季稻，仅玉溪专区将栽种185，000亩。这个专区的元江县除普遍栽种双季稻外，并在现有种双季稻的地区，试种三季水稻；今年全县要创造23个“千斤乡”。还有玉溪、江川、澄江、呈贡、晋宁等五个县由于种植双季稻，今年将达到千斤县。
