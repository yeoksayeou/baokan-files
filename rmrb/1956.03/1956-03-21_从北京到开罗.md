    From Beijing to Cairo
    --Cairo Air Report--
    Feng Zhidan
    On February 23rd, a silver four-engine plane flew away from the airspace of our great motherland, flying towards the capital of an ancient country on another continent.
    This plane carried envoys of culture and friendship sent by the Chinese people to Egypt. The Cultural and Art Delegation of the People's Republic of China was invited by the Egyptian government to visit and perform in Egypt.
    The plane flew over the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Arabian Sea, and past the edges of the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, as well as the Suez Canal connecting these two seas. This canal is the transportation artery of the three continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and was dug by 100,000 Egyptian farmers over ten years, at the cost of 20,000 lives, nearly a century ago. When the canal was completed in 1869, Egypt prepared celebrations, and playwrights and musicians wrote odes to the canal, but the Suez Canal did not bring any benefit to the Egyptian people. It became the "lifeline" of imperialism and a suction tube for plundering the Egyptian people.
    After passing the Suez Canal, we flew to the end of the desert. At 1:30 PM on February 25th, the plane descended in the golden sunshine and landed at Cairo Airport.
    As soon as we got off the plane, representatives from the Egyptian Republic Government's National Guidance Department, Ministry of Education, and Ministry of Religious Affairs came to welcome us. Bao Erhan, head of the Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation, delivered a speech at the airport, conveying the respect of the Chinese people to the Egyptian people, and the respect of Beijing to Cairo. More than a year ago, when Premier Zhou Enlai of our country passed through Cairo, he said to the Egyptian people at this airport: "The Chinese people have always sympathized with the Egyptian people's struggle for independence. I would like to take this opportunity to express my respect to the Egyptian people!" Premier Zhou Enlai's voice was welcomed by the Egyptian government and people.
    In the past few days, delegation leader Bao Erhan has separately met with ministers of various ministries of the Egyptian government. They had cordial conversations. The ministers' conversations reflected the Egyptian people's desire to be friendly with the Chinese people. Education Minister Hussein said to Bao Erhan when they met: "From the dawn of human civilization, Egypt and China have held high the torch of civilization before the people of the world. We hope that the relationship between the two peoples will become increasingly close and that we will once again assume the glorious mission of our two peoples." National Guidance Minister Radwan said: "Ancient Egypt and China have a history of thousands of years of friendship, and this friendship should be carried forward." Minister of Religious Affairs Bakuri and Minister of Industry and Commerce Nusair have both visited China. Minister Bakuri also signed a memorandum of cultural cooperation talks with our government on behalf of the Egyptian government. This visit by the art troupe is to implement this agreement. Minister Bakuri embraced Bao Erhan when he met him, and said, "We are all Orientals, and we are happy that the Chinese people have stood up." Minister Nusair talked to the leaders of the art troupe about strengthening economic ties between the two countries. Minister Bakuri and Minister Nusair also talked about the pleasant days they spent in China. State Minister Sadat said at the first meeting: "We welcome you, we love China, we love Chinese history, and we also love China's glory."
    On the afternoon of February 28th, Premier Nasser received the leaders of the art troupe and famous artists. Delegation leader Bao Erhan conveyed the cordial greetings of Premier Zhou Enlai of our country to Premier Nasser. Premier Nasser said: "I am honored by the arrival of your delegation to strengthen the relationship between the Egyptian and Chinese people." He said: "The Bandung Conference was the beginning of contact and close ties between Egypt and China. My meeting with Premier Zhou Enlai in Bandung has become a huge factor in strengthening the ties between the two countries and increasing mutual understanding." Premier Nasser mentioned that since the Bandung Conference nine months ago, many Egyptian delegations have visited China. He said: "These delegations often talk about the enthusiastic reception and welcome they received in China after returning to Egypt. As representatives of China, please convey my heartfelt thanks to the Chinese people." Premier Nasser hoped that the visit of the Chinese art delegation would become a factor in further close relations between the Chinese and Egyptian people. He expressed his gratitude for Premier Zhou Enlai's greetings and asked the art delegation to convey his cordial greetings to Premier Zhou Enlai.
    Since the arrival of the Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation, Cairo newspapers have published pictures and news about the delegation's activities in prominent positions every day.
    On a chance occasion, I met Abbas, a student at Cairo University. He talked to me about Chinese drama and music. He said that he had heard beautiful music from Beijing on the radio in the past, and now he is very happy that he has the opportunity to see the performance of the Chinese art troupe. Abbas said: "I find Chinese music particularly easy to understand. In the eyes of Egyptians, Chinese art is Eastern, and we can easily understand your art." (Attached picture)

    从北京到开罗
    ——开罗航讯——
    冯之丹
    2月23日，一架银色的四引擎飞机飞离我们伟大祖国的领空，向着另一个大陆上的古老国家的京城飞去。
    这架飞机载着中国人民派赴埃及的文化和友谊的使节。中华人民共和国文化艺术代表团应埃及政府的邀请，到埃及去进行访问演出。
    飞机从太平洋的上空飞越印度洋、阿拉伯海，飞经红海和地中海的边缘以及联结这两个海的苏彝士运河。这条运河是欧、亚、非三洲的交通孔道，在将近一百年前，由十万个埃及农民经过十年的劳动，付出了两万个生命的代价开凿而成。1869年运河竣工时，埃及曾经筹备庆祝，戏剧家和音乐家曾为运河编写了颂歌，可是苏彝士运河并没有给埃及人民带来任何利益。它变成了帝国主义的“生命线”和掠夺埃及人民的吸血管。
    过了苏彝士运河，我们飞行到了沙漠的尽头，2月25日下午一时半，飞机在金色的阳光下降落在开罗机场。
    我们一下飞机，埃及共和国政府国家指导部、教育部和宗教事务部部长的代表前来欢迎我们。中国文化艺术代表团团长鲍尔汉在机场发表了谈话，向埃及人民转致中国人民的敬意，向开罗转致北京的敬意。一年多以前，我国周恩来总理在途经开罗时曾在这个机场上向埃及人民说：“中国人民一向同情埃及人民的独立斗争。我愿趁此机会向埃及人民表示敬意！”周恩来总理的声音受到了埃及政府和人民的欢迎。
    这几天来，鲍尔汉团长分别拜会了埃及政府的各部部长。他们作了亲切的交谈。部长们的谈话反映了埃及人民要求同中国人民友好的愿望。教育部长侯赛尼在见到鲍尔汉团长时这样说：“从人类文明的黎明时期，埃及和中国就在世界人民面前高举了文明的火炬，我们希望两国人民的关系日益密切起来，重新担负起我们两国人民的光荣的使命。”国家指导部长拉德温这样说：“古老的埃及和中国有着数千年友谊的历史，这种友谊应该得到发扬。”宗教事务部长巴库里和工商部长努赛尔都曾访问过中国。巴库里部长并且代表埃及政府同我国政府签订了文化合作会谈纪要。这次艺术团的访埃就是执行了这一个协议。巴库里部长见了鲍尔汉团长就和他拥抱起来，他说：“我们都是东方人，我们因中国人民已经站起来了而高兴。”努赛尔部长向艺术团的领导人员谈到了两国经济联系的加强。巴库里部长和努赛尔部长还谈到了他们在中国度过的那些愉快的日子。国务部长萨达特一见面就说：“我们欢迎你们，我们爱中国，爱中国的历史，也爱中国的光荣。”
    二月二十八日下午，纳赛尔总理接见了艺术团的领导人员和著名艺术家。鲍尔汉团长向纳赛尔总理转达我国周恩来总理的亲切问候。纳赛尔总理说：“我为你们代表团的到来，以加强埃中两国人民的关系而感到荣幸。”他说：“万隆会议是埃中两国之间进行接触和密切联系的开端，我和周恩来总理在万隆的会见已成为加强两国联系和增进彼此了解的巨大因素。”纳赛尔总理提到在万隆会议后的九个月以来，埃及已有许多代表团访问了中国，他说：“这些代表团在回到埃及后经常谈起他们在中国所受到的热情的接待和欢迎。把你们作为中国的代表，请你们向中国人民转致我的衷心的谢意。”纳赛尔总理希望中国艺术代表团的访问成为中埃两国人民进一步密切关系的因素。他对周恩来总理的问候表示感谢，并要求艺术代表团向周恩来总理转致他的亲切的问候。
    自从中国文化艺术代表团到达以后，开罗的报纸每天以显著的地位刊登着有关代表团活动的图片和消息。
    在一个偶然的场合，我遇到开罗大学学生阿巴斯。他和我谈起中国的戏剧和音乐，他说，过去他曾从收音机中听到北京传来的美妙的音乐，现在他很高兴他有机会看到中国艺术团的演出了。阿巴斯说：“我觉得中国的音乐特别易懂，在埃及人看来，中国的艺术是东方的，我们能够容易地理解你们的艺术。”（附图片）
