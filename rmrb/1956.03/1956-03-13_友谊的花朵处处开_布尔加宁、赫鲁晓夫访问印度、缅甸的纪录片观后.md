    Flowers of Friendship Bloom Everywhere
    ——After Watching the Documentary of Bulganin and Khrushchev's Visit to India and Burma——

      "About 500 years ago, when the first European ships had not yet reached the shores of your country, a Russian traveler, Afanasy Nikitin, visited India and wrote a then-famous work, recording his years of residence and ardent love for your beautiful country." 500 years later, when Soviet Minister Council Chairman Bulganin mentioned this traveler to the Indian people, he was standing on the solemn rostrum of the Indian Republic's Parliament. In November and December of 1955, the Soviet leaders made a great journey that Nikitin could not have compared to. This trip further strengthened the friendly cooperation between the Soviet Union and India, Burma, and Afghanistan, consolidating the friendship between the Soviet people and the people of these three countries. Wherever the Soviet leaders went, flowers of friendship bloomed everywhere, and the people held the great envoys of the Soviet Union with ardent brotherly love.
    We should thank the outstanding Soviet photographers, who followed the journey of the Soviet leaders and used their superb photographic skills and exquisite artistic techniques to timely and truthfully record this great historical event, recording the moving friendship that was concentratedly expressed in this month.
      "Hindi, Rusi – bhai bhai!" This moving slogan is the common voice of 370 million Indian people. Starting from Palam Airport in New Delhi, it spread like spring thunder in all directions. From the misty foothills of the Himalayas to the clear southern coast, under the ancient Agra Fort, on the river-crossed plains of Punjab, on the streets of Bombay and Madras, in the factories of Bangalore, on the tall buildings and rooftops of Calcutta, everywhere were excited welcoming crowds, and everywhere resounded with this inspiring voice. In Burma, people also welcomed the Soviet guests with the same enthusiasm and cordiality. On the streets crowded with welcoming people, huge banners fluttering in the wind read, "Heartfelt respect to Bulganin!" "Heartfelt respect to Khrushchev!" On the road from Mingaladon Airport to the Presidential Palace, we saw the cars of the Soviet leaders had to stop repeatedly in the crowd to receive colorful rain of flowers and flower offerings from young women. The people of India, Burma, and Afghanistan clearly recognized that the people who have personally experienced exploitation and oppression and have overthrown this oppression with their own hands must be sincere and selfless friends of those who are fighting to safeguard and consolidate their national independence. This friendship is unbreakable. From the film, we can see that from the leaders of these countries to the kind and simple ordinary people, they received the Soviet leaders with unforgettable enthusiasm. Countless handshakes, endless cheers, endless colorful flags and banners, and endless streets paved with flowers formed a series of unforgettable scenes.
    What conclusion can we draw from these scenes? When Comrade Bulganin returned to Moscow, he said at the welcoming rally: "This friendship of the people has strengthened the front of peace-loving countries and made it more united. The front of peace-loving countries has become stronger and more powerful. It will become even stronger in the future, and we believe it will surely be victorious."
    Comrade Bulganin's words are what we deeply feel from the film. Isn't the huge sound composed of applause, laughter, songs, and cheers precisely the powerful symphony predicting this victory?
    The film also takes us into the solemn hall of the Indian Presidential Palace. On December 13, 1955, Comrades Bulganin and Khrushchev and Prime Minister Nehru signed a joint statement. The declaration states: "Countries with different political, social and economic systems can and should cooperate on the basis of mutual respect, non-interference in internal affairs, and actively implement the policy of peaceful coexistence in order to realize the ideals of peace and improve human living conditions." Yes, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence ("Panchsheel") not only conform to the interests of the people of the Soviet Union and India, but also conform to the common interests of the people of the world.
    If we want to find an example of peaceful coexistence, these two excellent documentaries are one of the most concrete and moving examples.
    As an excellent documentary "Bulganin and Khrushchev's Visit to India," we must also mention the merits of the photographers. In such a busy and intense schedule, they still managed to capture the most exciting and inspiring shots in an orderly manner. Whether it is the description of the static picturesque environment, or the long shot of the car speeding forward in the welcoming crowd, whether it is the grand scene of the sea of people, or the close-up of the facial expression of an ordinary person, they are all so prominent and vividly give people an unforgettable impression, and are full of a poetic sense of beauty.
    Excellent photographers also do not miss some touching details. At the state-run farm in the southern foothills of the Himalayas, Soviet leaders visited the poultry farm. Comrade Bulganin picked up a chick and looked at it, and the American and British photojournalists who followed the Soviet leaders all day hurriedly took this shot. At this time, Comrade Khrushchev said with a smile:
    "Be careful not to add a caption that the Bolsheviks are strangling Indian chicks."
    In the laughter of everyone, the photojournalists embarrassedly put down their cameras.
    The reason why this shot aroused our great interest and made us deeply grateful to the photographer is not only because it timely recorded this moving moment, but also because the description of this detail hit the nail on the head for some people. For those newspapers and their masters who are talking nonsense and saying that the Soviet leaders' visit is a "danger" to India and Burma, isn't this an extremely pungent and extremely sharp satire?
    Let peace-loving people all over the world watch this documentary! In the ocean of people moving, in the thunderous applause, people will feel what a powerful force this is. As good brothers of the Soviet people, as good friends of the people of India and Burma, our audience of the People's Republic of China, from these documentaries, more keenly realize that the friendly cooperation of the peace-loving countries that account for the vast majority of the world's population is an invincible rock-like force!
    Also, let a small group of atomic maniacs on Wall Street watch this film! Those who pride themselves on being good at using "deterrence" policies, those who revel in the "art of the brink of war," come and see the scenes at the airports of New Delhi and Yangon or on the square of Calcutta. If you wish, please also recall Nixon's dismal trip to Asia two years ago as your "friendly envoy." Just yesterday in the newspaper, we saw the news that Dulles' plane quietly landed at the deserted Palam Airport. He should be very clear: what kind of atmosphere is "welcoming" him? For those who believe in the "position of strength," this is a very practical "deterrent." The eyes of the Asian people are discerning. They can clearly distinguish who is a sincere and trustworthy good friend and who is a sinister conspirator, just like distinguishing the sun from the night.

    友谊的花朵处处开
    ——布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫访问印度、缅甸的纪录片观后——
    袁鹰
      “大约在500年前，当第一批欧洲船只还没有到达你们国家的海岸的时候，俄国的一位旅行家阿法纳西·尼基京就访问了印度，并且写了一部当时很出名的作品，记述他住了好几年并且热烈爱上了的你们这个美妙的国家的情况。”500年后，当苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁同志向印度人提到这个旅行家的时候，他正站在印度共和国国会的庄严的讲坛上。1955年11月到12月里，苏联领袖们作了一次尼基京所远不能比的伟大的旅行。这次旅行，进一步加强苏联同印度、缅甸、阿富汗这三个国家之间的友好合作，巩固了苏联人民同这三国人民之间的友谊。在苏联领袖们行踪所到之处，友谊的花朵遍地盛开，人民对伟大的苏联的使者们怀着热烈的兄弟般的挚爱。
    应该感谢苏联的优秀摄影师们，跟随着苏联领袖们的旅程，以他们的卓越的摄影技巧，精湛的艺术手法，及时地、如实地纪录了这个历史性的伟大事件，纪录了在这一个月中集中表现出来的动人的友谊。
      “印地，露西——巴伊巴伊！”这句动人的口号，是37，000万印度人民共同的心声。从新德里的巴兰机场开始，像春雷一般地向四面八方传动。从薄雾笼罩着的喜马拉雅山麓到明朗的南方海岸，在古老的亚格拉城的城堡下，在旁遮普的河流纵横的平原上，在孟买和马德拉斯的大街上，在班加罗尔的工厂里，在加尔各答的高楼和屋顶上，到处是激动着的欢迎的人群，到处都响彻了这个激荡人心的声音。在缅甸，人们也是怀着同样的热忱和亲切的情意欢迎苏联贵宾。在挤满欢迎人群的街道上，迎风飘展着“向布尔加宁致衷心的敬意！”“向赫鲁晓夫致衷心的敬意！”的巨幅标语。从明加拉顿机场到总统府的道路上，我们看到苏联领袖们的汽车，在人丛中不得不屡次停下来，接受缤纷的花雨和少女们的献花。印度、缅甸和阿富汗的人民都清楚地认识到，亲身受过剥削、压迫并且已经用双手推翻了这种压迫的人民，必然是那些为维护和巩固自己的民族独立而斗争的人们的真诚无私的朋友。这种友谊是牢不可破的。从影片里，我们可以看到，从这些国家的领袖，直到那些善良、朴实的普通人民，是那样地以令人难忘的热情接待苏联领袖。数不清的握手，听不完的欢呼，看不尽的彩旗和标语，走不完的用鲜花铺成的街道，组成了一连串永远不能忘怀的场面。
    从这些场面里，我们会得到什么结论呢？布尔加宁同志回到莫斯科的时候，在欢迎大会上这样说过：“这种人民的友谊加强了爱好和平国家的阵线，使它更为团结。爱好和平国家的阵线变得更加强而有力了。它将来还会更加强大，我们相信，它一定会胜利的。”
    布尔加宁同志的话，正是我们从影片里深切地感觉到的。那些掌声、笑声、歌声和欢呼声所组成的巨响，岂不正是预祝这个胜利的强力的交响乐吗？
    影片还把我们带进了印度总统府的庄严的大厅。1955年12月13日，布尔加宁同志、赫鲁晓夫同志和尼赫鲁总理签署了联合声明。声明里指出：“政治、社会、经济制度互不相同的国家可以而且应当在互相尊重、互不干涉内政的基础上实行合作，共同为实现和平和改善人的生活条件的理想而实行积极的和平共处的政策。”是的，和平共处的五项原则（“潘查希拉”），决不只是符合苏联和印度两国人民的利益，而且是符合全世界人民的共同利益的。
    如果要找和平共处的榜样的话，这两部精彩的纪录片，正是最具体、最动人的榜样之一。
    作为一部出色的纪录片的“布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫访问印度”，我们也不能不提到摄影师们的功绩。在那样活动频繁的紧张的日程中，他们仍然有条不紊地抓住了最精彩、最能激动人心的镜头。无论是静止的风景如画的环境的描写，或者是随着汽车在夹道欢迎里飞驶前进的长镜头，无论是人山人海的大场面，或者是一个普通人的面部表情的特写，都是那么突出、鲜明地给人以难忘印象，并且充满了诗一般的美的感觉。
    卓越的摄影师们也不放过一些动人的细节。在喜马拉雅山南麓的国营农场里，苏联领袖们参观了养禽场。布尔加宁同志拿起一只小鸡看了看，那些终日跟随着苏联领袖们的美国和英国的摄影记者们连忙拍下这个镜头。这时候，赫鲁晓夫同志微笑着说：
    “当心，可别加上布尔什维克在扼死印度小鸡的说明啊。”
    在大家的哄堂大笑声里，摄影记者们狼狈地放下摄影机。
    这个镜头之所以引起我们绝大的兴趣并且使我们深深感谢摄影师，还不仅在于它及时地记录了这个动人的一刹那，更因为这个细节的描写，恰恰打中了某些人的要害。对那些正在胡说八道、说苏联领袖的访问对印度和缅甸来说是一种“危险”的报纸和它们的主子们，这不是一个极其辛辣、极其尖锐的讽刺吗？
    让全世界爱好和平的人们都来看一下这部纪录片吧！在万头钻动的汪洋的人海里，在雷动的掌声里，人们会感到这是一股多么强大的力量。作为苏联人民的好兄弟，作为印度、缅甸人民的好朋友，我们中华人民共和国的观众，从这几部纪录片里，更加亲切地体会到占世界人口绝大多数的爱好和平国家的友好合作，就是不可战胜的磐石般的力量！
    也让华尔街的一小撮原子狂人们来看一下这部影片吧！那些自炫善于运用“威慑”政策的人，那些陶醉于“战争边缘的艺术”的人，来看一下新德里、仰光的机场或者加尔各答广场上的场面吧。愿意的话，也请他们回忆一下他们的“友好特使”尼克松两年前在亚洲的那次黯然的旅行吧。就在昨天的报纸上，我们又看到了杜勒斯的座机悄然降落在冷冷清清的巴兰机场的消息。他应该很清楚：“欢迎”他的是什么样的气氛？对于迷信“实力地位”的人，这倒是很实际的“威慑”。亚洲人民的眼睛是雪亮的，谁是真诚的、可以信赖的好朋友，谁是心怀叵测的阴谋家，他们分辨得清清楚楚，就像分辨太阳和黑夜一样。
