	Competition Heatwave on the Huangpu River
		By Our Reporter Ji Yin
			Catch Up, Meet the Needs of Farmers
	The great victory of socialist transformation has made Shanghai younger and more vibrant. Now, the production enthusiasm of Shanghai's workers is gradually rising. From the cotton textile mills of Yangshupu to the steel mills of Pudong; from the shipyards on both sides of the Huangpu River to the machine factories in the suburbs; from large factories with thousands of people to thousands of small factories scattered throughout the city, socialist competition red flags are flying everywhere, and good news of industrial production is spreading everywhere. This new upsurge makes Shanghai in early spring even more vibrant.
	The gradual increase in the production enthusiasm of the workers is closely linked to the high tide of agricultural cooperation. The rapid development of agricultural cooperation, especially after the promulgation of the 1956-1967 National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), resulted in orders with astonishingly large numbers pouring in from all over the country like snowflakes; purchasing personnel rushed to Shanghai in batches. The most urgent need in rural areas is for means of production. In the first quarter of this year, Shanghai produced a total of 250,000 double-wheel double-furrow plows and double-wheel single-furrow plows, accounting for about one-quarter of the total national production. Many rural areas are asking Shanghai to supply industrial products needed for water conservancy construction, the construction of small power stations, the development of transportation, the elimination of the "four pests", and the elimination of illiteracy. Henan and Shandong plan to dig 1 million wells this year and need Shanghai to supply a large amount of lead wire, rivets, sheet iron, and well-digging tools. The Hebei Supply and Marketing Cooperative wants the Shanghai Transportation and Telecommunications Equipment Company to supply 40,000 sets of large truck tires. A single special district in Henan Province requested the supply of 3,000 sets of large truck tires. Many old agricultural machines that had been stockpiled for a long time were also snapped up. More than 2,000 local heavy industrial factories in the city are concentrating on producing various agricultural machines.
	The demand numbers for daily necessities in rural areas are even more staggering. Fabrics, underwear, medicines, stationery, rubber shoes, sewing machines, radios... all are in short supply. Commercial departments had to supply many commodities ahead of schedule. The 800,000 bolts of cloth originally planned to be supplied in February and March were sent to rural areas in January. Many factories have increased their production plans again and again, and the cadres of industrial administrative organs are both surprised and moved by the astonishingly large demand orders.
			People Don't Return Home, Let the Machines Return Home
	"Catch up quickly and meet the demands of our farmer brothers!" This is the common slogan of Shanghai workers recently. The factory competitions are all centered around this. Mechanical and electrical factories have proposed to ensure that high-quality agricultural machinery is delivered to rural areas before the spring plowing; electrical equipment factories guarantee to send sufficient numbers of telephones, radios, and broadcasting equipment to rural areas, so that rural areas can establish telephone networks and broadcasting networks; pharmaceutical factories and medical equipment factories guarantee that rural areas can get sufficient medicines and equipment to eliminate the "four pests" and schistosomiasis; textile printing and dyeing factories propose to produce thousands of beautiful floral fabrics for farmers this year. In order to allow farmers in various places to use 250,000 agricultural machines produced in Shanghai to till the damp soil in the first spring after the great development of agricultural cooperation, this year during the Spring Festival, workers in more than 300 factories in Shanghai manufacturing agricultural machinery put forward the slogan "People Don't Return Home, Let the Machines Return Home". Yan Junjie, a young worker at the Qiwen Machinery Factory, had planned to return to his hometown to visit his wife this Spring Festival, but on the eve of the Spring Festival, he wrote to his wife and told her: "I will come to see you after the double-furrow plow is made, and I can also see how our double-furrow plow works." During the Spring Festival, all the steelmaking workers in the steelmaking workshop of the joint state-private Da Long Machinery Factory happily cast the plowshares of the double-wheel with-furrow plow. The workers said: "Let us pour our enthusiasm for celebrating the Spring Festival into the new agricultural tools, so that the double-wheel with-furrow plow can return to our hometown on our behalf to visit our relatives."
		The Efforts of Workers in Joint State-Private Factories
	Tens of thousands of workers in joint state-private factories in Shanghai are a vigorous and powerful new force in the recent socialist competition in Shanghai, which makes the competition have a more massive scale and richer and deeper content. According to recent incomplete statistics, more than 2,000 newly joint state-private factories in the city have launched competitions. The youth shock brigades in joint state-private enterprises that have grown up in the high tide of socialist transformation have developed to more than 4,200 teams, with a total of more than 70,000 members, all of whom have joined the labor competition.
	Recently, new production records and new figures have continuously emerged in joint state-private enterprises, attracting widespread attention from society and making the competition more active and vibrant. Mao Jintai Hardware Factory is a small factory with only 34 direct production workers. Shortly after the approval of joint state-private ownership, it and two other factories received the task of producing parts for double-wheel double-furrow plows. Among them, there were 500,000 chain parts. If the old method of manual work was used, it would take 30 workers 3 months to complete. But the task had to be completed within 40 days. What a big gap this was! Everyone was extremely anxious about this, because this was the first task after the factory's joint state-private ownership. At this time, Qian Yongyin, a young fitter, suggested changing manual production to machine production, and immediately worked with Ding Taohua and other workers to convert a discarded blanking machine into an automatic machine for manufacturing chain links. After more than ten days of day and night efforts, they finally succeeded in creating it on February 15. This machine only needs one worker to operate, and can produce more than 50,000 chain parts a day, and can complete the entire task in 10 days. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League later awarded Qian Yongyin the honorary title of "Youth Production Shock Worker".
	The production level of many joint state-private factories has rapidly improved in the competition. Targets and quotas have been broken again and again, and some factories have approached the level of similar state-owned factories. The newly joint state-private Shanghai Datong Oil Press Factory has seen new records continuously emerge since the start of the competition on January 31. On February 8, the oil extraction rate of soybeans containing 18% oil reached an average of 15.076%, creating the highest hot-pressing oil extraction rate record in Shanghai. If this achievement can be consolidated, this factory can increase oil production by more than 420,000 catties this year without increasing raw materials.
		We Must Achieve Results in Terms of Quality
	Shanghai has more favorable technical conditions than any other region in the country. In this competition, Shanghai workers and leading organs paid special attention to improving product quality, reducing product costs, and increasing new product varieties. They must make outstanding achievements in this regard. The inter-factory labor competition that is being hotly launched in 106 textile printing and dyeing factories in Shanghai has clearly put forward improving product quality as the center of the competition, striving to reach the new quality standards stipulated by the state. All factories and all advanced producers have put forward unit plans and individual plans to improve product quality. This competition centered on quality has now begun to yield good results. The state-owned Shanghai No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory and No. 5 Cotton Textile Factory have already improved the quality of all products to the new standards stipulated by the state in early February. Under light inspection, the number of impurities and cotton knots contained in every 10 grains (equal to one-seventh of a pound) of cotton yarn does not exceed 90-95 grains. Before and after the Spring Festival, all cotton yarn from Shanghai No. 3 Cotton Mill, No. 13 Cotton Mill, and No. 8 Cotton Mill also reached the new quality standards; after February 20, No. 15 Cotton Mill and No. 7 Cotton Mill also caught up with the advanced teams.
		The Struggle Goals of Engineering and Technical Personnel
	Technical personnel played a decisive role in improving product quality. The quality of yarn and cloth at the state-owned Shanghai No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory used to be very unstable. In the first and third quarters of last year, the quality plan was not completed, and the quality of cotton yarn became the worst among Shanghai state-owned textile factories. After the launch of the competition to improve quality, the factory's party committee and administrative departments used the form of technical research groups to organize all the factory's technical personnel into the labor competition, and worked with technical workers to study measures. The three technical research groups for cotton cleaning, carding, and spinning studied a total of 53 measures, and the two groups for sizing and cloth machines studied a total of 15 measures. A total of more than 120 specialized problems were studied. After this series of efforts, this factory finally became the first advanced factory to reach the state's new quality standards.
	More and more technical personnel and other office personnel are becoming involved in the competition, which is a characteristic of the breadth and depth of this industrial competition in Shanghai. The great victory of socialist transformation, the acceleration of industrialization, the promulgation of the Agricultural Development Program (Draft), and especially the communication of the Central Committee's meeting on intellectuals, gave great encouragement to the technical personnel of various factories in Shanghai. Many offices in factories that were previously regarded as "dead corners" are now active. Some engineers who had been very dull in the past have now become activists. Many engineers have formulated personal effort plans for the future and have listed joining the Communist Party as their struggle goal. Technical personnel in many factories have organized themselves in various forms to launch competitions. The combination of technical personnel and workers has been further developed. In the competition, the technical personnel of the state-owned Shanghai Electric Motor Factory concentrated on handling more than 500 rationalization proposals put forward by the workers. They often went to the workshop to find the workers who made the suggestions to understand the situation, and helped them design the rationalization suggestions into drawings, and some helped the workers improve and supplement the shortcomings of the original suggestions to make the suggestions more perfect. The combination of technical personnel and workers has powerfully promoted the development of rationalization proposal work.
			You Help Me, I Help You
	In this socialist competition in Shanghai, mutual learning and mutual assistance have become a widespread social mass activity. Backward factories learn from advanced factories, joint state-private factories learn from state-owned factories, and new joint state-private factories learn from old joint state-private factories. Workers went beyond the scope of the factory and visited brother factories in teams, exchanging various experiences in an organized or spontaneous manner. Not long ago, the Shanghai Joint State-Private Da Long Machinery Factory held an advanced metal cutting experience demonstration meeting. This demonstration meeting was held by state-owned factories to help workers in joint state-private factories improve cutting efficiency by using old machine tools. Sheng Li and Lu Zhigen, labor models from the state-owned Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, demonstrated more than 20 advanced high-speed cutting experiences for the workers of the joint state-private factory at the meeting. The inspection work in Shanghai's soap industry used to be backward, and the product quality often failed to meet the standards. Now, they have learned from the experience of the Joint State-Private Wuzhou Soap Factory, learned from the Soviet advanced inspection methods, and researched and manufactured rapid inspection instruments, and the product quality has been guaranteed. Recently, Wuzhou Soap Factory also formulated a plan to accurately teach this rapid inspection method to 8 new joint state-private soap factories in an accelerated manner.
			The Problem Now Lies in Leadership
	The socialist enthusiasm of Shanghai workers is impacting all backward and decadent things like the tide of the Huangpu River, profoundly changing the face of enterprises and people, turning backward factories and workshops into advanced factories and workshops, and making the originally advanced even more advanced. After receiving the state's production tasks, the party committee of the state-owned Asia Steel Factory was filled with gloom at the party committee meeting. People believed that there was not enough labor, not enough equipment, and not enough space... The meeting ended without results again and again. "The task is too heavy!", the factory director was anxious and worried, and asked to resign. Later, the members of the party committee decided to walk out of the office and go to the workshops and offices separately to take a look. They found that the workers were completely different, neither sighing nor shouting difficulties, everyone was using their brains, making suggestions, and full of confidence and optimism. The members of the party committee went down and touched for 3 days, and all returned to the office with smiles on their faces. The unfinished party committee meeting achieved a satisfactory result, without increasing personnel or equipment, the task could be completed. The secretary of the party committee summarized his feelings in one sentence: "The problem now is indeed not with the masses, but with our leadership!" This meaningful sentence is also the sincere experience of many industrial leading cadres in Shanghai during this period. Now Shanghai leading organs are taking various measures to actively lead the competition. A large number of cadres from party committees and administrative organs have gone deep into various factories. Work in all aspects is being strengthened. Shanghai leading organs have proposed to turn this competition into a lasting movement with broad mass participation. Correction
	In the "Instructions of the Ministry of Commerce on Quickly Strengthening and Improving the Wholesale and Retail Work of Department Stores at All Levels" on page 2 of this newspaper on March 7, the phrase "Department stores in Tianjin, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an and other cities should have more than 150,000 varieties of products. Department stores in other provincial capitals should have about 150,000 kinds of goods..." should have "150,000" changed to "15,000".
	Also, in the seventh paragraph of the article "Putting Production Planning on an Advanced and Reliable Basis", "530,000 pot-camel machines" should be "53 pot-camel machines".

    黄浦江边的竞赛热潮
    本报记者  季音
            赶上去，满足农民需要
    社会主义改造的伟大胜利，使上海变得更加年轻、活跃。而现在，上海职工群众的生产积极性逐步高涨。从杨树浦的棉纺织厂，到浦东的钢铁厂；从黄浦江两岸的造船厂，到市郊的机器工厂；从几千人的大工厂，到分布全市的上千个小工厂，到处都飘扬着社会主义竞赛的红旗，到处传播着工业生产的捷报，这个新的热潮使得初春的上海变得更加生气勃勃。
    职工群众生产积极性的逐步高涨，是和农业合作化高潮紧紧地相结合的。农业合作化事业的飞跃发展，特别是1956——1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）公布以后，数目字大得惊人的要货单，雪片似地从全国各地送来；采购人员一批又一批地赶到上海。农村里要得最迫切的是生产资料，今年第一季度，上海共生产25万部双轮双铧犁和双轮单铧犁，约占全国生产总数的四分之一。许多农村要求上海供给兴修水利、建设小型发电站、发展交通运输、除“四害”、扫除文盲等所需要的工业品。河南和山东今年要打井100万口，要上海供给大量铅丝、元钉、铁皮和打井的工具。河北供销合作社要上海交通电讯器材公司供应大车轮胎4万套。河南省一个专区就要求供应3，000套大车轮胎。许多过去长期积压下来的旧农业机器，也被抢购一空。全市有2，000多家地方重工业工厂，在集中生产各种农业机器。
    农村对生活资料的要货数字更是大得惊人。布匹、内衣、药品、文具、胶鞋、缝纫机、收音机……都是供不应求。商业部门只好把许多商品提前供应，原来计划在二、三月份供应的80万匹布，在一月份就送到农村去了。许多工厂的生产计划一增再增，工业行政管理机关的干部拿着数字惊人的要货单，又是惊讶，又是感动。
            人不回乡，让机器回乡
    “赶快赶上去，满足农民兄弟的要求！”这是最近以来上海工人们普遍的行动口号。工厂的竞赛都是围绕着这个中心来进行的。机电工厂提出要保证在春耕前把质量优等的农业机械送到农村；电器器材工厂保证把足够数量的电话机、收音机、广播器送到农村，让农村建立电话网、广播网；制药厂和医疗器械工厂保证要使农村能够得到充分的消灭“四害”和消灭血吸虫病的药械；纺织印染厂提出要在今年为农民们生产出几千种美丽的花布。为了使各地农民在农业合作化大发展以后的第一个春天，就能用上海生产的25万部农业机械来翻掘潮湿的泥土，今年春节，上海制造农业机器的300多个工厂的工人们，提出了“人不回乡让机器回乡”的口号。启文机器厂青年工人严俊杰早就打算好在今年春节回乡去看望爱人，但在春节前夕，他写信告诉爱人：“等到双铧犁做好后再来看你，并且还可以看看我们生产的双铧犁效果如何。”在春节里，公私合营大隆机器厂制钢车间的全体炼钢工人们，愉快地浇铸着双轮带铧犁的犁头。工人们说：“把我们欢度春节的热情，浇入新农具中去，让双轮带铧犁代替我们回乡看望亲人。”
          公私合营厂工人的努力
    上海成千上万公私合营工厂的工人，是最近上海社会主义竞赛中一支生气勃勃的强大的生力军，它使竞赛有了更加巨大的规模和更加丰富深刻的内容。据最近的不完全统计，全市新公私合营的工厂已经展开竞赛的有2，000家以上。在社会主义改造高潮中成长起来的公私合营企业中的青年突击队，已经发展到4，200多个队，共有队员7万多人，都投入了劳动竞赛。
    最近以来，在公私合营企业中，新的生产纪录和新的人物不断出现，引起了社会上的广泛注意，也使得竞赛变得更加活跃和有生气。毛锦泰五金厂是一个只有34个直接生产工人的小型厂，在批准了公私合营以后不久，就和另外两家工厂接到了生产双轮双铧犁零件的任务。其中有50万只链条零件，如果照老办法用手工做，就要30个工人做3个月才能做完。但是任务要40天内完成。这是个多么大的距离啊！大家都为此焦虑万分，因为这是工厂公私合营后的第一笔任务。这时候，青年钳工钱涌银建议把手工生产改为机器生产，并且立即和丁桃花等几个工人，动手把一部废弃的落料车改装成制造链条环的自动车。他们经过了十几天的日夜努力，终于在2月15日创制成功。这部机器只要一个工人掌握，一天可以生产链条零件5万只以上，10天就能完成全部任务。青年团上海市委会事后授予了钱涌银以“青年生产突击手”的光荣称号。
    许多公私合营工厂的生产水平在竞赛中迅速地提高了。指标、定额被突破了再被突破，有的厂已经接近了同类国营工厂的水平。新公私合营的上海大统榨油厂，从1月31日开展竞赛以后，新纪录不断出现，2月8日，榨含油18％的大豆，出油率平均达到15.076％，创造了上海全市热榨出油率的最高纪录，如果能够把这个成绩巩固下来，这个厂今年可以不增加原料多增产油42万多斤。
        一定在质量方面做出成绩来
    上海有比全国任何地区优越的技术条件。在这一次竞赛中，上海工人们和领导机关特别注意提高产品质量，降低产品成本，以及增加新的产品品种。他们一定要在这方面做出卓越的成绩来。上海106个纺织印染厂正在热烈展开的厂际劳动竞赛，就明确提出了以提高产品质量为竞赛的中心，争取达到国家规定的新的质量标准。各工厂，各先进生产者，都提出了提高产品质量的单位计划和个人计划。这个以质量为中心的竞赛现在已经开始得到良好的收获。国营上海第四棉纺织厂和第五棉纺织厂，已经在2月上旬把全部产品质量提高到国家规定的新标准，每10个格林（等于七百分之一磅）的棉纱，在灯光检验下，所含的杂质及棉结的粒数都不超90—95粒。春节前后，上海国棉三厂、国棉十三厂、国棉八厂的全部棉纱也达到新质量标准；2月20日后，国棉十五厂、国棉七厂也赶上了先进队伍。
          工程技术人员的奋斗目标
    在提高产品质量的工作中，技术人员们起了决定性的作用。国营上海第四棉纺织厂过去的纱、布质量一直是很不稳定的，去年第一、第三两个季度都没有完成质量计划，棉纱质量成为上海国营纺织厂中最差的一个厂。开展了提高质量的竞赛以后，工厂党委和行政部门用技术研究小组的形式把全厂技术人员组织到劳动竞赛中来，和技术工人们一起研究措施，清棉、梳棉和细纱三个技术研究小组共研究了53项措施，浆纱和布机二个小组共研究了15项措施，先后共研究了120多项专门问题。经过这一系列的努力，这个厂终于成为最先达到国家新质量标准的先进厂。
    愈来愈多的技术人员和其他科室人员卷入到竞赛中来，是上海这次工业竞赛的广泛性和深刻性的一个特点。社会主义改造的伟大胜利，工业化的加速，农业发展纲要（草案）的公布，特别是中央关于知识分子问题会议的传达，给上海各工厂的技术人员以极大的鼓舞。许多工厂中过去一直被视为“死角”的科室，现在都活跃起来了。有些过去一直很沉闷的工程师，现在成了活动分子。不少工程师订出了今后个人努力规划，并且把参加共产党列为自己的奋斗目标。许多工厂的技术人员用各种形式组织起来，展开竞赛。技术人员同工人的结合有了进一步发展。国营上海电机厂的技术人员在竞赛中，突击处理职工们提出的500多件合理化建议，他们经常下车间去找提出建议的工人了解情况，并且帮助他们把合理化建议设计成图样，有的则帮助工人改进和补充原建议的不足部分，使建议更加完善。技术人员和工人的结合，有力地推动了合理化建议工作的开展。
              你帮我，我帮你
    在上海的这次社会主义竞赛中，相互学习，相互帮助，成了一种广泛的社会性的群众活动。落后厂向先进厂学习，公私合营厂向国营厂学习，新公私合营厂向老公私合营厂学习。职工们越出了工厂的范围，一队又一队地到兄弟厂去参观，有组织地或者自发地交流各种经验。不久前，在上海公私合营大隆机器厂里，举行了一次金属切削先进经验表演会，这次表演会是国营工厂为了帮助公私合营工厂工人利用旧机床提高切削效率而举办的。国营上海机床厂劳动模范盛利、陆志根等人，在会上为公私合营厂工人们表演了20多种高速切削先进经验。上海制皂工业中过去检验工作一向落后，产品质量经常不合格，现在，他们学习了公私合营五洲皂厂的经验，学习了苏联先进的检验法，研究并制成了快速检验的仪器，产品质量就有了保证。最近，五洲皂厂还订出了计划，用速成方法准确地把这个快速检验的方法传授给8家新公私合营制皂厂。
            现在的问题在于领导
    上海工人们的社会主义积极性，正像黄浦江的潮水一样冲击一切落后腐朽的东西，深刻地改变着企业和人的面貌，使落后的工厂和车间变成了先进的工厂和车间，原来先进的变得更加先进。国营亚细亚钢铁厂在接到了国家的生产任务之后，党委会议上愁云重重，人们认为劳动力不够，设备不够，场地不够……。会议一次又一次的都无结果而散。“任务太重啦！”，厂长又急又愁，要求辞职。后来，党委委员决定走出办公室，分头下车间和科室去看看。他们发现工人们是完全的另外一种调子，既没有人叹气，也没有人喊困难，人人都在动脑筋，提建议，充满信心和乐观情绪。党委委员们下去摸了3天，个个笑容满脸的回到了办公室，没有结束的党委会议取得了圆满的结果，既不要增人，也不要增设备，任务可以完成。党委书记用一句话总结了他的感想：“现在的问题确实不在于群众，而在于我们领导了！”这句意义深长的话，也是这个时期来上海许多工业领导干部的真切体会。现在上海领导机关正在采取各种措施，要积极地领导竞赛。党委和行政机关的大批干部已经深入各工厂。各方面的工作都在加强。上海市领导机关提出，一定把这次竞赛变成一个具有广泛群众性的持久的运动。更正
    3月7日本报2版“商业部关于迅速加强和改善各级百货公司批发零售工作的指示”中“天津、南京、杭州、武汉、广州、重庆、西安等城市百货商店经营的品种应有150，000种以上。其他省会所在地的百货商店，应有150，000种左右的商品……”一句中的“150，000”应为“15，000”。
    又“把生产规划放在先进可靠的基础上”文内第七段“锅驼机53万台”应为“锅驼机53台”。
