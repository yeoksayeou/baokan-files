The "Month for Restoring Japan-China and Japan-Soviet Diplomatic Relations" movement was held in various parts of Japan from February 15th to March 15th under the auspices of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China and Japan-Soviet Diplomatic Relations. On March 17th, representatives and masses from all walks of life and organizations in Japan held the "National大会 for the Restoration of Japan-China and Japan-Soviet Diplomatic Relations" in Tokyo, and passed two resolutions: "On Immediately Reaching an Agreement in the Japan-Soviet Negotiations" and "Promoting the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations." The大会 decided to submit these resolutions to Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama and the Diet, demanding immediate implementation. This movement profoundly reflects the strong desire of the Japanese people from all walks of life for the urgent restoration of normal relations between Japan and China, and Japan and the Soviet Union.

Japan and China, and Japan and the Soviet Union, are neighboring countries separated only by the sea. The Japanese people and the people of China and the Soviet Union have had rich economic and cultural ties for a long historical period. The existence and continuation of the current abnormal state prevents many major issues related to economy, culture, and other aspects between China and Japan, and between the Soviet Union and Japan, from being resolved normally, thereby affecting all aspects of the lives of the Japanese people. Therefore, the broad masses of the Japanese people and Japanese patriots have been making long-term and multi-faceted efforts to promote the normalization of relations between Japan and China, and Japan and the Soviet Union, and have formed the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China and Japan-Soviet Diplomatic Relations to promote this movement. In the current session of the Japanese Diet, members of the Japanese Socialist Party have repeatedly questioned the Japanese government, demanding the restoration of Japan-China and Japan-Soviet diplomatic relations. Suzuki Mosaburo, chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, pointed out that the Socialist Party believes that the time has come for the normalization of relations between Japan and China.

The Japanese ruling figures are not unaware of this strong desire of the Japanese people. In the Japanese general election at the beginning of last year, the current ruling figures made the restoration of Japan-China and Japan-Soviet diplomatic relations one of their campaign promises. However, the actual actions of the Japanese government, especially the Japanese diplomatic authorities, often do not conform to this. In the Soviet-Japan negotiations in London, the Japanese side insisted on certain unrealistic conditions, which caused the negotiations to be prolonged. Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu recently stated that Japan might consider temporarily suspending these negotiations. Regarding the restoration of normal relations between China and Japan, the Japanese diplomatic authorities, on the one hand, admit that "this issue must be resolved," and on the other hand, say that "now is not the time."

People do not see any basis for the so-called "now is not the time." Because everyone knows that the Chinese side and the Soviet side have a clear and positive attitude towards restoring normal relations with Japan. Our government has repeatedly suggested to the Japanese government that the two governments should discuss issues related to promoting the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. The Soviet government has consistently adopted a reasonable and rational negotiating attitude in the Soviet-Japanese negotiations in London. Even the Japanese negotiator Shunichi Matsumoto said that the Soviet attitude was "very reasonable." This proves that as long as the Japanese government is determined, the issue of restoring normal relations between Japan and China, and Japan and the Soviet Union, is not difficult to solve.

We deeply sympathize with the situation of Japan under foreign occupation. We know that the United States has been interfering with the normalization of relations between Japan and China, and Japan and the Soviet Union. After the Karachi Conference, Dulles went to Japan, reportedly to "discuss" Japan's relations with China and the Soviet Union with the Japanese authorities. Obviously, the United States is obstructing the normalization of relations between Japan and China and the Soviet Union in order to maintain its control over Japan, thereby hindering the further easing of the international situation. This external interference runs counter to Japan's national interests; and as the trend of the times dictates, the United States' attempt to obstruct the easing of the situation is bound to fail. Japanese politicians with foresight can see that Japan's tenable policy can only be the independent and autonomous policy demanded by the Japanese people.

The Chinese people are willing to continue to strengthen friendly relations with the Japanese people, and express great sympathy and support for the movement of the Japanese people and politicians to strive for the restoration of Japan-China and Japan-Soviet diplomatic relations. The persistent struggle of the Japanese people will surely have an increasingly greater impact in Japan, overcome all kinds of artificial obstacles, and achieve victory.

    日本人民的斗争一定胜利
    在日本恢复日中、日苏邦交国民会议的发起下，日本各地从2月15日到3月15日举行了群众性的“恢复日中、日苏邦交月”的运动。3月17日，日本各阶层、各团体的代表和群众又在东京举行了“恢复日中、日苏邦交全国大会”，通过了“关于立刻使日苏谈判达成协议”和“促进恢复日中邦交”的两项决议。大会决定把这些决议提交给日本首相鸠山一郎和国会，要求立刻实行。这次运动，深刻地反映了日本各阶层人民迫切要求恢复日中、日苏正常关系的强烈的愿望。
    日本同中、苏两国是隔海相望的邻邦。日本人民和中、苏两国人民在很长的历史时期中就有了丰富的经济文化联系。目前的不正常状态的存在和延续，使得中日之间、苏日之间有关经济、文化和其他方面的许多重大问题都不能正常地解决，从而影响到日本人民生活的各个方面。因此，日本广大人民和日本爱国人士为了促成日中、日苏关系的正常化，已进行了长期的、多方面的努力，并且组成了恢复日中、日苏邦交国民会议来推动这一运动。在日本国会的本届会议中，日本社会党的议员曾几次向日本政府提出质询，要求恢复日中、日苏邦交。日本社会党主席铃木茂三郎指出：社会党认为日本同中国的关系正常化的时候已经来到了。
    日本执政人士对于日本人民的这种强烈愿望也并不是不了解的。在去年年初的日本大选中，现在的执政人士，就曾把恢复日中、日苏邦交作为竞选诺言之一。但是，日本政府，特别是日本外交当局的实际行动却往往与此不符。在伦敦的苏日谈判中，日方坚持某些不现实的条件，使得谈判长期拖延。日本外务相重光葵最近还表示日本可能考虑暂时中止这个谈判。对于恢复中日正常关系，日本外交当局一面承认“必须解决这个问题”，一面又说“现在不是时候”。
    人们看不出所谓“不是时候”有何根据。因为大家知道，中国方面和苏联方面，对于恢复同日本的正常关系，态度都是明朗的，积极的。我国政府已经屡次向日本政府建议，由两国政府对促进中日关系正常化的问题进行商谈。苏联政府在伦敦的苏日谈判中，一直采取合情合理的协商态度，就连日本谈判代表松本俊一也说，苏联的态度是“非常合理的”。这就证明只要日本政府下决心，恢复日中、日苏正常关系的问题是不难解决的。
    我们对于在外国占领下的日本的处境，寄予深切的同情。我们知道，美国对于日本同中、苏关系的正常化，一直横施干涉。杜勒斯在喀喇蚩会议之后去到日本，据透露就是要同日本当局“讨论”日本对中、苏关系的问题。很明显，美国阻挠日本同中苏关系的正常化，是为了保持它对日本的控制，从而阻挠国际局势的进一步缓和。这种外来的干涉同日本的民族利益背道而驰；而且大势所趋，美国阻挠局势缓和的企图必然失败。日本明眼的政治家们可以看到，日本的站得住的政策，只能是日本人民所要求的独立自主政策。
    中国人民愿意继续加强同日本人民之间的友好关系，并对日本人民和政治家们为争取恢复日中、日苏邦交的运动表示极大的同情和支持。日本人民坚持不懈的斗争，一定会在日本国内发生愈来愈大的影响，克服种种人为的障碍，取得胜利。
