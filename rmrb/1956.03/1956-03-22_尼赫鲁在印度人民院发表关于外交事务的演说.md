Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 21st. Prime Minister Nehru delivered a speech on foreign affairs in the People's Assembly on March 20th. The full text is as follows:

    As the People's Assembly knows, in the past few months, we have had the pleasure and honor of welcoming many distinguished foreign visitors to India. These visitors have come from many lands as goodwill ambassadors from countries with widely different cultures and different systems of thought and organization. We have extended to all of them a warm and heartfelt welcome in the spirit of friendship to all - a spirit which is characteristic of our foreign policy, just as it is indeed a tradition of our nation and our people. I have held long and detailed conversations with all of them, both on the many aspects of major world issues and on specific issues of common concern to the relevant countries and ourselves, and I would like to take this opportunity to talk about how valuable these conversations have been and how much benefit I have derived from them. Of course, it cannot be expected that as a result of these conversations, the foreign policies of our country or any other relevant country will undergo sudden changes. Foreign policy is not made and changed in this way. Nevertheless, these private conversations, conducted in a frank and informal atmosphere, have enabled us, and I hope also our visitors, to better appreciate each other's points of view. These conversations have helped us to gain a better understanding of the thinking of those who are directly engaged in the formulation and direction of policy in their respective countries. Where we have not been able to agree, we have agreed to disagree.

    It is impossible for me in this statement to talk about all of these conversations or to mention the many issues that are troubling the world and that are relevant to us. Perhaps later I may mention some of these international issues in the People's Assembly. At present, I would like to talk about some of the important issues that we have recently discussed with our distinguished visitors.

    Among these guests, the three most recent were the United Kingdom's Foreign Secretary Lloyd, the United States Secretary of State Dulles, and the French Foreign Minister Pineau. We welcomed them as representatives of the three major countries in the world, and I discussed with them separately the international situation and how to best ease tensions and promote peace as the goal of all countries. These politicians came to this part of the world to attend the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council meeting in Karachi. To our great surprise, the Council, at the request of one of its member states, deemed it appropriate at this meeting to discuss the Kashmir issue and to include a declaration on this issue in its final communique. Such action by the Council has confirmed our worst fears about the organization it represents. The stated purpose of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is to increase the defensive strength of the contracting parties against external aggression and internal subversion. We do not understand how the Kashmir issue falls within the scope of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council. Its mention of Kashmir can only mean that this military alliance supports one country, namely Pakistan, in its dispute with India. For any organization to take such action to harm a country friendly to individual countries within that organization will be considered wrong at any time. But in the present case, it goes further than that. We regret to note that three other Commonwealth countries also participated in the offensive declaration. We have protested to all relevant countries against the extraordinary steps taken by the Council.

    I spoke with Dulles about the military aid the United States is giving to Pakistan. I told him how this aid causes us serious concern. The atmosphere in Pakistan seems to be one of threat and danger to India. India remains the target of fierce attacks in some Pakistani newspapers, and even responsible leaders make bellicose statements from time to time. Recently, there have been border incidents again, which are of particular significance in terms of their frequency and the wide area they cover.

    Therefore, India is increasingly convinced that whatever the purpose of the military aid given by the United States to Pakistan, from Pakistan's own point of view, Pakistan generally welcomes the military strength thus acquired, not because it increases Pakistan's ability to defend against possible aggressors, but because they hope to be able to resolve disputes with India from a so-called position of strength.

    We in India have goodwill towards Pakistan. It has just declared itself a republic, and we are willing to express our best wishes to it at the beginning of a new chapter in its history. We sent one of our ministers as a special envoy to Karachi to personally express our congratulations. We have no intention of engaging in any arms race with Pakistan or any other country, even if we had the strength to do so. Our strength and resources have been entirely used, and will continue to be used for many years to come, on our Five-Year Plan, and none of us want to divert any part of our limited resources to arms spending. However, those responsible for the fate of India have to pay attention to certain facts. Just when we in Asia should be devoting all our capabilities to the task of development, this military aid creates new factors that create tension and instability, and I can only express our regret and disappointment at this situation. I have made our views on this point clear to Dulles, and I hope he now has a better understanding of our views.

    Recent developments have once again focused attention on military treaties. The number of such treaties has not only not decreased, but seems to be increasing, and, regardless of previous obligations and statements, these treaties are being strengthened and expanded. This is the history of all treaties, especially the Southeast Asia Defense Treaty and the Baghdad Pact. The former treaty appeared when peace came to Southeast Asia after many years of war. Tensions had eased, and people were expecting a return to normalcy. There was no possibility of aggression in the foreseeable future. Yet, at this moment of relief and the emergence of hope, this treaty appeared and immediately led to an increase in tensions. The more recent Baghdad Pact has brought division, insecurity, and dissatisfaction to West Asia. Thus, the original purpose of signing these treaties has itself failed. We are convinced that these two treaties and similar military treaties and alliances will not increase the internal defense strength of these regions. Increasing their internal defense strength, however, is said to be the intent of these treaties and alliances.

    In the face of the situation where any bloc is signing military treaties and further preparing for war, it is contradictory to talk about disarmament, and it is a mockery of the declared purpose. If it is in everyone's interest to revise policies, if it is in the interest of peace, there is always time to revise policies, even if doing so involves some major powers. Tensions cannot be eased and peace and stability cannot be re-established in the places where conflicts are currently occurring by concluding military alliances and using strength against strength. We believe, and we further affirm our confidence with each new experience, that only by adhering to and implementing the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, now known to everyone as Panchsheel, is there hope for a new era of international peace and stability.

    The emergence of atomic energy and the terrible weapons developed from it in the world has made all previous ideas, not only in the military field but also in other fields, obsolete. Thoughtful people and leaders of all countries therefore reject war. In this new situation, it makes no sense to cling to the concept of the Cold War. We have repeatedly said that nuclear weapons must be banned and atomic energy must be used for the welfare of mankind, not controlled by great powers. If war is to be rejected, then the Cold War is unreasonable and harmful. The Cold War can only maintain an atmosphere of hatred, fear, and the ever-present danger of turning into a nuclear war.

    Secretary of State Dulles and I also discussed the Goa issue. The People's Assembly knows that the joint statement he and Portuguese Foreign Minister Cunha issued a few weeks ago aroused deep resentment throughout India. We immediately raised this matter with the United States government, and we explained to them that, given the current situation in Goa, the United States Secretary of State's involvement in such a statement could only have one effect: to encourage Portugal to pursue policies that represent the worst kind of colonialism. Dulles assured me during our meeting that, although the United States signed the joint statement, it was not supporting Portugal against India. We certainly do not doubt this statement. However, the situation remains: the Portuguese authorities are specifically interpreting the joint statement as if it were supporting Portugal's demands. We have made our position clear to the United States government, and I am willing to repeat it here: under no circumstances will we tolerate the continued existence of the last vestiges of Portuguese colonialism on Indian soil. We have been patient, and we will continue to do so, but there will be no compromise on this issue. I still hope that friendly countries will be able to make Portugal realize that it is unwise to continue pursuing a sixteenth-century colonial policy in the second half of the twentieth century.

    The three foreign ministers and I discussed the situation in West Asia in detail. We all agreed that this situation is an explosive one. I cannot presume to offer any quick solutions to this difficult problem. At the same time, I have no doubt that solutions can arise from a gradual easing of tensions. Here, the Baghdad Pact must again bear some responsibility for the current disputes that are troubling West Asia. This treaty has divided Arab unity, thereby making the already difficult problem even more difficult and complex.

    I discussed the situation in Indochina with the three foreign ministers, especially the British Foreign Secretary, the co-chairman of the Geneva Conference. India, at the invitation of the Geneva Conference countries, agreed to serve as chairman of the three international commissions in Indochina. We did so in the hope that this troubled region of Southeast Asia would finally be permanently restored to peace - a region so close to us and with which we have so many long-standing historical ties. Now, it appears that the elections stipulated in the final declaration of Geneva as a preliminary step towards the unification of the two parts of Vietnam are unlikely to be held on schedule. Therefore, we must review the situation on matters concerning me. We have no intention of trying to evade our position of responsibility, nor will we take steps that would hinder a peaceful resolution. We have therefore suggested to the two co-chairmen that they should examine the situation and decide on the steps that should be taken to ensure that the Geneva Accords are adhered to. I have reason to hope that the two co-chairmen will meet and discuss the current situation.

    The discussions with the three foreign ministers also covered the current situation in East Asia. In particular, the situation regarding the coastal islands of Jinmen and Mazu, and Taiwan. I explained to them once again that we believe the fundamental cause of the trouble in East Asia is the failure to recognize the obvious fact. This fact is the emergence of a new China, historically unprecedentedly unified, powerful, strong, and aware of its rights and dignity. I believe that as long as the People's Republic of China is not admitted to the United Nations, the situation in East Asia cannot return to normal. I specifically expressed the view that China will never feel secure as long as Jinmen and Mazu remain occupied by hostile forces. The necessary first step would be to withdraw those forces from those islands so that the islands can become part of the mainland. The Taiwan issue will still exist, but I believe that if the coastal islands can be returned to China, the Taiwan issue can be dealt with somewhat more easily.

    On this point, we have been watching with concern the talks between the United States Ambassador and the Chinese Ambassador in Geneva. Both sides generally agree that they should resolve their disputes through peaceful negotiations. The main difficulty now is applying this principle to the specific issue of Taiwan. We hope that a satisfactory solution can also be found on this point, thereby paving the way for discussions on other outstanding issues, including a meeting between the foreign ministers of the two countries.

    I would like to make special mention of my conversation with Mr. Pineau regarding North Africa. We in India value and welcome the steps taken by France to restore sovereignty to Morocco and Tunisia. The difficult issue of Algeria remains. I am pleased to find that Mr. Pineau takes a realistic view of the situation. The People's Assembly will not expect me to discuss the details of these discussions further, as the problem there is complicated by the presence of approximately 1.25 million people of European descent who have been settled there for generations. I hope that the Algerian issue will also be resolved in a way that is satisfactory to both the French people and the Algerian people.

    Shortly before Mr. Pineau arrived in Delhi, we received from the French government a draft treaty on the legal transfer of sovereignty over the former French territories in India. We do not anticipate any difficulty in reaching an agreement on this draft, and I hope that the legal transfer of sovereignty will not be delayed for long.

    Disarmament is essential if peace is to be expected. As with other difficult issues, it may be easier to proceed step by step. The subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission has been meeting in London and has reached a considerable degree of agreement on this issue. But unfortunately, the increasingly tense world situation has not created a favorable atmosphere for disarmament, and the urgency of disarmament has increased with the invention and accumulation of weapons with ever-increasing destructive potential. We believe in unconditionally banning the production, use, and testing of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons, and, as a step towards achieving this goal, halting experimental explosions and implementing an arms truce.

    I would like to take this opportunity to draw the attention of the People's Assembly to a very important event in recent weeks. I am referring to the recent 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union held in Moscow. There is no doubt that this congress has adopted new lines and new policies. This new line, both in political thought and in practical policy, seems to be based on a more realistic assessment of the current world situation, and represents a process of significant adaptation and adjustment. According to our principles, we do not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, just as we do not welcome any interference from other countries in our affairs. However, any significant development in any country that appears to be a step towards creating conditions conducive to the pursuit of a policy of peaceful coexistence is important to us and to others. Therefore, we believe that the decisions of the 20th Congress of the Soviet Union may have far-reaching effects. I hope that this development will lead to a further easing of world tensions.

    I would like to briefly mention the speech made by the Prime Minister of Pakistan in his parliament yesterday. Generally speaking, I would wait until I received a more complete and authoritative copy before commenting on a speech, but since I am speaking here today, I thought I should say something about it.

    I read the brief report of this speech and was saddened and surprised. Muhammad Ali spoke in anger and made some obviously incorrect statements. He said that India is conducting a campaign of fear and hatred and creating an atmosphere of hatred towards Pakistan. It is not difficult to compare the newspapers in India and the newspapers in Pakistan, the statements made by Indian officials and the statements made by Pakistani officials. For a long time, there have been the most virulent attacks on India in Pakistan, and calls for jihad from time to time. Have any officials or newspapers in India talked about war or really talked about hatred? Even now, immigrants from East Pakistan are constantly arriving in India. This is a great burden on us and a matter of serious concern. We naturally draw attention to this and to the reasons that force people to leave their homes and flee to other countries.

    Muhammad Ali spoke about the recent border incidents and said that these incidents were created by India and that every aggression came from the Indian side. I would have no difficulty dealing with statements that have little to do with the truth. I can narrate a long list of these incidents, and I can present the background facts of these incidents as we know them, and any impartial authority can judge them. I will only mention here one well-known incident, because an impartial authority did indeed investigate, judge, and make a decision on this incident. That is the Nikowal incident on the Jammu border. United Nations observers investigated this incident and made it clear which side was at fault. The then Prime Minister of Pakistan publicly assured us that he would abide by the decision of the United Nations observers and punish the guilty. We are still waiting for this promise to be fulfilled. We have written repeatedly, but to no avail.

    Muhammad Ali said that he had written to me and made certain suggestions, but that he had not received a reply from me. This is correct. However, I only received his letter the night before last. We only had one day to consider this letter. We hope to send a reply soon. In his letter, Muhammad Ali mentioned the decisions made at the meetings of the Indo-Pakistani Boundary Demarcation Joint Steering Committee on March 11 and 12, 1955, and apparently accused India of delaying the implementation of this decision. This decision was further considered at a meeting between our Minister of the Interior and the Pakistani Minister of the Interior in May 1955. They reached an agreement known as the Pant-Mirza Agreement. The Pakistani government had taken no action to approve this agreement until the end of 1955, and later suggested certain amendments to the agreement, which in fact greatly changed the agreement. But I welcome the Prime Minister's proposal on the demarcation of the Indo-Pakistani border and am prepared to study it immediately.

    In his speech, Muhammad Ali suggested that India and Pakistan declare that they will never fight each other. I welcome this suggestion. Everyone knows that for several years, we have been suggesting that India and Pakistan make a declaration of non-aggression against each other. However, our suggestion was not accepted by the Pakistani government. I am very glad that Muhammad Ali now views this suggestion with approval, and we will gladly continue to pursue this matter.

    Nothing could be more foolish than a conflict between India and Pakistan. We have been working to create friendly feelings between the two countries; I believe that, despite the many unfortunate events of the past, there is a great degree of friendship between the people of India and the people of Pakistan today. We should become closer, not by military means or threats of war or by talking to each other from a so-called position of strength. In this world of atomic bombs, India and Pakistan are both weak. But we can develop other kinds of strength - the strength of friendship, the strength of cooperation, and the strength of raising the living standards of our people. I put forward Panchsheel to the Prime Minister of Pakistan with the greatest goodwill and sincerity, and I am fully convinced that if we can use these five principles as the basis for our dealings with each other, the nightmare of fear and suspicion will disappear.

    尼赫鲁在印度人民院发表关于外交事务的演说
    新华社新德里21日电　尼赫鲁总理三月二十日在人民院发表了关于外交事务的演说。全文如下：
    正如人民院所知道的，在过去几个月中，我们愉快而荣幸地欢迎了许多著名的外国访问者到印度来访问。这些访问者是作为有广泛不同的文化和不同的思想和组织体系的国家的亲善使者从许多国土到来的。我们本着对一切人友好的精神——这种精神是我们的外交政策的特征，就像它实在也是我们国家和我们人民的传统的特征一样——向他们所有的人表示热烈的和衷心的欢迎。我同他们所有的人无论在世界重大问题的许多方面还是在对某一个有关国家和我们自己共同有关的问题上，都进行了长时间的详尽交谈，我希望趁这个机会谈谈这些会谈是多么有价值和它们使我得到了多大的益处。当然不能期望，由于这些会谈的结果，我们国家或是任何其他有关国家的外交政策会有突然的改变。外交政策不是以这种方式制定和改变的。尽管这样，这些在坦率不拘形式的气氛中进行的私人的会谈使我们能够，而且我希望使我们的访问者们也能够，更好地体会彼此的观点。这些会谈帮助我们对那些在他们各自的国家是直接从事政策的制定和指导的人们的想法得到更好的了解。在我们没有能够取得一致的地方我们同意保留分歧。
    我不可能在这项声明中谈到这些会谈的全部或是提到使世界不安的而且是同我们有关的许多问题。也许以后我可能在人民院提到这些国际问题中的一些问题。目前，我希望谈到一些最近我们同我们的卓越的访问者们所讨论过的一些重要问题。
    在这些客人中，最近的三位是联合王国外交大臣劳埃德，美国国务卿杜勒斯和法国外交部长比诺。我们把他们当作世界上三个主要国家的代表来欢迎，我同他们分别讨论了国际局势以及如何充分缓和紧张局势和促进作为一切国家的目标的和平的办法。这些政治家到世界这个地区来是由于参加喀喇蚩的东南亚条约组织理事会会议。使我们非常惊讶的是，理事会在这次会议上由于它的一个成员国的要求而认为讨论克什米尔问题和把对这个问题的宣言包括在它的最后公报中的做法是适宜的。理事会这样的做法使我们对它代表的那个组织的最坏的疑虑得到了证实。东南亚条约组织的公开目的是增加缔约国抵抗外部侵略和内部颠复活动的防御实力。我们不明白克什米尔问题如何会属于东南亚条约组织理事会范围之内。它提到克什米尔的话只能意味着这个军事同盟在一个国家，即巴基斯坦，同印度的纠纷中支持这个国家。对任何组织来说，做出这种行动来损害对这个组织中的个别国家友好的国家，在任何时候都将被认为是错误的。但是，在目前这个问题中，事情还不止于此。我们遗憾地注意到，其他三个英联邦国家也参加了冒犯人的宣言。我们对理事会采取的出乎寻常的步骤向一切有关国家提出了抗议。
    我同杜勒斯谈到了美国给巴基斯坦的军事援助。我告诉他这种援助如何引起我们严重的不安。巴基斯坦的气氛似乎是一种对印度威胁和危险的气氛。印度仍旧是某些巴基斯坦报纸猛烈攻击的对象，甚至负责领袖也不时发表好战言论。最近，边境事件又有发生，这些事件就其频繁程度和波及的地区广泛来说，是有特别的重要意义的。
    因此印度愈来愈相信：不论美国给予巴基斯坦的军事援助的目的是什么，从巴基斯坦的本身来说，巴基斯坦对因而获得军事实力普遍表示欢迎，这并不是因为它增加了巴基斯坦对可能的侵略者的防御能力，而是因为他们希望借此能够从所谓实力地位来解决同印度的纠纷。
    我们在印度的人对巴基斯坦怀有好感。它刚刚宣布它自己为一个共和国，我们在它的历史的新的一章开始的时候愿意表示我们对它的最好的愿望。我们派遣了我们的部长之一作为特使去喀喇蚩亲自表达我们的祝贺。我们无意同巴基斯坦或任何其他国家进行任何军备竞赛，即令我们有力量进行这种竞赛。我们的力量和资源已经完全用在、而且在今后许多年将继续用于我们的五年计划上，我们当中没有任何人希望把我们有限的资源的任何部分改用在军备开支上。然而，对印度的命运负责的人不得不注意某些事实。正当我们在亚洲的人应该把我们的能力全部用来从事开发的任务的时候，这种军备援助造成了制造紧张局势和不安定的新因素，我只能对这种情况表示我们的遗憾和失望。我已经把我们对这一点的意见向杜勒斯作了明白的解释，我希望他现在对我们的意见有更好的了解。
    最近的发展再次使人们的注意力集中在军事条约上。这种条约的数目不但没有减少，看来反而在增加，并且，不论以前所承担的义务和发表的声明怎样，这些条约正在加强和扩大。所有条约的历史都是这样，特别是东南亚防御条约和巴格达条约。前一个条约是在东南亚经过许多年的战争后有了和平的时候出现的。紧张局势已经有了缓和，人民在期望恢复正常状态。在可能看到的将来，没有发生侵略的可能。然而，正在这个松了一口气和开始出现希望的时刻这个条约出现了，并且立即引起了紧张局势的增加。时间更近的巴格达条约已经为西亚带来了分裂、不安全和不满。因此，签订这些条约的本来目的本身是失败了。我们深信，这两个条约和类似的军事条约和联盟不会增加这些区域内部的防御力量。而增加它们的内部防御力量却据说是这些条约和联盟的本意所在。
    在面临到任何一个集团在签订军事条约和在进一步准备战争的情况下来谈论裁军问题是矛盾的，而且也是对所宣布的目的的嘲弄。如果修改政策是对大家都有利的，是对和平有利的，修改政策总是有时间的，即令这样做牵涉到一些大国。在目前发生冲突的地方是不能靠缔结军事联盟和用实力对付实力的办法来缓和紧张局势和重新建立和平和安定的。我们认为，而且在每一次有了新经验后我们进一步肯定了我们的信心：只有遵守和实行现在大家都知道的叫做潘查希拉的五项原则，才有希望出现国际和平和安定的新时代。
    原子能和从它发展出来的可怕的武器在世界上的出现使得以前的不仅在军事方面而且也在其他方面的全部想法都成为过时了。各国的有思想的人和领袖因此都排斥战争。在这种新的情况下，死抱住冷战的概念不放是没有道理的。我们曾一再说过，核子武器必须予以禁止，原子能必须用于人类的福利，而不是由大国来控制。如果要排斥战争的话，那么冷战就是不合理的和有害的。冷战只能保持仇恨、恐惧和变成核子战争这种经常存在的危险的气氛。
    我和杜勒斯国务卿也讨论了果阿问题。人民院知道，他和葡萄牙外交部长库纳几星期以前发表的联合声明在印度各地引起了深刻的愤懑情绪。我们立即向美国政府提出了这件事，我们向他们解释，按照目前果阿的情况，美国国务卿跟这样一种声明发生关系只能产生一种效果，那就是鼓励葡萄牙奉行代表最坏一类的殖民主义的政策。杜勒斯在同我会谈的时候向我保证，美国虽然在联合声明上签了字，但是它并不是支持葡萄牙反对印度。我们当然不怀疑这个声明。但是，情况还是这样：葡萄牙当局特别把联合声明解释为好像它是支持葡萄牙的要求的。我们已经向美国政府表明了我们的立场，我愿意在这里重复一遍：无论在什么情况下，我们绝不容忍葡萄牙在印度土地上的殖民主义的最后残余继续存在。我们一直是有耐心的，今后我们将继续这样做，但是在这个问题上是不会有妥协的。我仍然希望，友好国家将能够使葡萄牙认识到：在二十世纪的后半世纪仍然奉行着十六世纪的殖民主义政策是不聪明的。
    我和所有这三位部长都详细讨论了西亚的局势。我们都同意，这种局势是一种具有爆炸性的局势。我不能冒昧对这个困难问题的任何迅速解决提出建议。同时，我也不怀疑，解决办法能够从紧张局势的逐渐缓和中产生。在这里，对现在正在烦扰着西亚的目前纠纷，巴格达条约又要负一部分责任。这个条约分裂了阿拉伯的统一，从而使已经够困难的问题的解决变得更困难、更复杂了。
    我同三位外交部长、特别是日内瓦会议共同主席英国外交大臣讨论了印度支那局势。印度应日内瓦会议国家的邀请而答应了担任在印度支那的三个国际委员会的主席，我们之所以这样做是由于希望这个东南亚多事地区终于会永久恢复和平——这个地区对我们是如此接近，我们对它有如此多的长久的历史上的联系。现在，看起来日内瓦最后宣言中所规定的、作为越南两个部分统一的先行步骤的选举大概是不能如期举行了。因此我们不得不在同我有关的问题上审查一下局势。我们无意于试图逃避责任地位，也不采取将会妨碍和平解决的步骤。因此我们已向两位共同主席建议，他们应当检查一下情况并且就为了使日内瓦协定得到遵守而应予采取的步骤作出决定。我有理由希望，两位共同主席将会晤并讨论目前的局势。
    同三位外交部长的讨论还涉及了东亚的目前局势。特别是关于金门和马祖这两个沿海岛屿以及台湾的局势。我再一次向他们解释，我们认为东亚发生麻烦的基本原因是不承认明显的事实。这个事实就是历史上空前统一的、有力的、强大的和意识到它的权利和尊严的新中国的出现。我认为，只要中华人民共和国不被接纳入联合国，东亚的局势是不能恢复正常的。我特别表示了这种意见：只要金门和马祖仍由敌对部队占据着，中国是决不会放心的。必要的第一着步骤将是把那些部队从这些岛屿上撤出，以便这些岛屿能成为大陆的一部分。台湾问题仍将存在，但是我相信如果沿海岛屿能归还中国，台湾问题是能够略为易于处理一些的。
    关于这一点，我们一直在关切地注视着美利坚合众国大使和中国大使在日内瓦进行的会谈。双方大体上同意，它们应当通过和平的谈判方法来解决它们之间的纠纷。现在的主要困难是把这个原则应用于台湾这个具体问题上。我们希望也将找出关于这一点的令人满意的方案，从而为讨论其他未决问题——包括两国外长的会晤在内——铺平道路。
    我愿意特别提一提我同比诺先生进行的关于北非的交谈。我们印度人重视和欢迎法国为了使摩洛哥和突尼斯恢复主权而采取的步骤。困难的阿尔及利亚问题仍旧存在。我高兴地发现比诺先生对局势采取现实的观点。由于那里有着已经定居了几代的约125万欧洲血统的人而使那里的问题复杂化，人民院不会期望我再多谈这些讨论的细节。我希望阿尔及利亚问题也将在法国人民和阿尔及利亚人民彼此都满意的情况下得到解决。
    在比诺先生到达德里之前不久，我们从法国政府接到了关于在法律上移交以前法国在印度的属地的主权的条约草案。我们预料在就这个草案达成协议方面不会有什么困难，我希望主权的法律上的移交不会长久拖延。
    如果指望得到和平，裁减军备是至为必要的。正如对待其他困难问题一样，也许还是一步一步地来进行比较容易。联合国裁军委员会小组委员会一直在伦敦举行会议，并且已经在这个问题上达成相当大程度的协议。但是不幸，日益紧张的世界局势并没有为裁减军备创造有利的气氛，而裁减军备的迫切性已经随着具有日益增加的毁灭潜力的武器的发明和积累而增加了。我们相信无条件地禁止生产、使用和试验核子及热核子武器，以及，作为达到这个目的的步骤，停止试验性爆炸、实行军备休战。
    我希望趁这个机会提请人民院注意最近几个星期以来的一个非常重要的事件。我指的是最近在莫斯科召开的苏联共产党第二十次代表大会。毫无疑问，这次代表大会采取了新的路线和新的政策。这种新路线，无论是在政治思想上还是在实际政策上，看来都是以对目前世界局势的比较现实的估计为基础的，并且代表着意义重大的适应和调整的过程。根据我们的原则，我们不干涉其他国家的内政，正如我们不欢迎其他国家对我们进行任何干涉一样。但是，任何国家里的任何重要的事态发展，如果看来是创造有利于奉行和平共处政策的条件的步骤，那末，它对我们和对其他人说来都是很重要的。因此，我们认为，苏联的第二十次代表大会的决定可能会产生深远的影响。我希望这种事态发展将导致世界紧张局势的进一步缓和。
    我想简略地提一提巴基斯坦总理昨天在他的议会中的发言。一般说来，我是要等到接到比较充分的和权威的副本以后才对一个发言发表评论的，但是，我认为我既然今天在这里发言，我应该就这件事说一些话。
    我读了这篇演说的简略报道，感到遗憾和惊讶。穆罕默德·阿里是在气愤中发言的并且发表了一些显然不正确的言论。他说，印度正在进行恐惧和仇恨的运动并且制造了对巴基斯坦的仇恨气氛。不难把印度的报纸和巴基斯坦的报纸、把印度负责人和巴基斯坦负责人所发表的言论拿来比较一下。在巴基斯坦很久就有人对印度进行最激烈的攻击并且不时呼吁进行圣战。在印度有没有过任何负责人或者是报纸谈过战争或者真的谈过仇恨的话的呢？甚至到目前还有东巴基斯坦的移民络绎不绝地来到印度。这对我们是很大的负担，而且是值得严重关切的问题。我们自然提请人们注意到这一点并且注意到迫使人民背井离乡逃入别国的原因。
    穆罕默德·阿里谈到最近的边境事件，并且说，这些事件是印度制造的，而且每一次侵略都是来自印度方面。我要对付与真相没有什么关系的言论是没有多大困难的。我能够叙述一大串的这些事件，我能够就我们所知道的把这些事件的背景事实提出来，任何公正的权威都能加以判断。我在这里只提一桩大家熟知的事件，因为对这件事，公正的权威的确曾经调查过，判断过并且作出了决定。那就是查谟边境的尼科瓦尔事件。联合国观察员调查过这个事件并且明白表示过错误在哪一边。当时的巴基斯坦总理曾经公开向我们保证，他将遵守联合国观察员的决定并且惩罚犯罪的人。我们现在还在等待这种诺言付诸实施。我们已一再写信但是毫无效果。
    穆罕默德·阿里说过，他曾经写信给我并且提出了某些建议，但是他没有得到我的答复。这是对的。但是前天晚上我才收到他的信。我们只有一天的时间考虑这封信。我们希望不久把答复送去。穆罕默德·阿里在他的信中提到了1955年3月11日和12日印度—巴基斯坦边界划分联合指导委员会的会议上所作出的决定并且显然指责印度拖延实施这个决定。这项决定曾在1955年5月由我们的内政部长和巴基斯坦内政部长举行会议加以进一步的考虑。他们达成了称为潘特—米尔扎协定的协议。巴基斯坦政府在1955年年底以前一直没有采取行动批准这个协定，后来又建议对这个协定作某些修改，这些修改实际上大大地改变了这个协定。但是我欢迎总理关于划分印度巴基斯坦边界的建议并且准备立即研究这个建议。
    穆罕默德·阿里在他的演说中建议印度和巴基斯坦宣布它们永远不相互作战。我欢迎这个建议。每个人都知道，好几年来，我们一直建议印度和巴基斯坦两国发表不相互作战的宣言。但是，我们的建议没有被巴基斯坦政府接受。我很高兴，穆罕默德·阿里现在已经以赞同的态度看待这个建议，我们将欣然地继续执行这件事情。
    没有什么事情能够比印度和巴基斯坦之间发生冲突来得更愚蠢。我们一直努力在两国之间创造友好的感情；我相信，虽然以前发生了许多不幸的事件，印度人民和巴基斯坦人民之间今天存在很大程度的友谊。我们要更加接近起来不是靠军事方法或者战争威胁或者从所谓实力地位来对彼此交谈。在这个原子弹的世界里，印度和巴基斯坦都是弱的。但是，我们可以发展其他方面的力量——友谊方面、合作方面和提高我们人民的水平方面的力量。我怀着极大的善意和诚意向巴基斯坦总理提出潘查希拉，我完全确信：如果我们能够以这五项原则作为我们彼此来往的基础，恐惧和猜疑的恶梦将会消逝。
