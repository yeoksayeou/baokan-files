    "On the Kangbu’er Grassland" and its Performance
    Playwright and Performance: Gansu Provincial Drama Troupe. Director: Wu Yuxiao

    "On the Kangbu'er Grassland" is a collective creation of the Gansu Provincial Drama Troupe. It tells the story of how the Tibetan people in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, under the leadership of the Communist Party, smashed the conspiracy of the American-Chiang Kai-shek special agents and won permanent liberation. It depicts the working spirit of our state personnel who are not afraid of difficulties and hardships, and who complete the tasks assigned by the Party and the state with boundless enthusiasm and confidence, as well as the noble qualities full of optimism. At the same time, it also depicts the Tibetan people's thick, brave character and their hardworking, simple life. The characteristic of this play is that the plot is tense, and the story is moving and beautiful. It praises the growth and victory of the people on the grassland.
    In this creation, the author not only wrote a tense and moving story, but also portrayed some very colorful characters. The author is good at portraying characters in clear actions and prominent conflicts, and at embodying the brilliance of the Party's policies while highlighting the contradictions and portraying the characters. The author understands the characteristics of dramatic art very well. For example, not long after the opening, a young member of the work team, Xiao Ding, caught a fish from the river. This very active event vividly and concretely depicts the characters, thoughts, and ideas of the main characters in the play—the leader of the work team, Fang Zhen, as well as Grandpa Ka’ertai and Xiao Ding. At the same time, it also makes us deeply feel the embodiment of the spirit of the Party's policies in trivial matters. The scene where Grandpa Ka’ertai buys cloth has the same effect.
    The success of the author in portraying positive characters also lies in placing the positive characters at the forefront of the conflict to describe them, which is very powerful. For example, in the second act, some people were incited and deceived by the enemy, came to question the work team, and returned the medicine they gave to the patients, and wanted to take back the blood drawn from the patients for testing. This is a very difficult situation to deal with. The author put Fang Zhen and Grandpa Ka’ertai there, letting them face such sudden problems and having to solve them. For example, in the first scene of the fourth act, the enemy used the most vicious and insidious means to undermine the relationship between the headman and the work team, and stabbed the headman's only beloved son in front of the work team's tent. At this time, because the headman was provoked by the enemy and did not fully trust the work team, he almost completely lost his mind when he encountered such a thing, and ordered his subordinates to arrest the work team. This is such a serious and tense scene. The author put Fang Zhen in such a serious juncture, undergoing tests. As a result, the image of Fang Zhen, a positive character, was prominently established.
    In such a tense scene as mentioned above, the author did not forget to meticulously portray other characters, and these characters developed according to the logic of their own thoughts and behaviors. For example, in the scene mentioned above, almost all the main characters in the play were present (including positive and negative characters), and each character had further development in this sharp contradiction. For example, the deputy leader of the work team, Liu Mingang, was handled very appropriately. Before this scene, Liu Mingang had just made the enemy's trick succeed because of his own ideological errors, putting the work team in a more complicated and difficult situation, and was criticized by Fang Zhen, and then this happened. The author only used eight sentences of dialogue between Liu Mingang and Headman Jiaoba to show the development of Liu Mingang's character, giving people a more complete impression of him. The author portrayed many positive and negative characters such as Fang Zhen, Grandpa Ka’ertai, Liu Mingang, Xiao Ding, and Daobu in this way. The dialogue of the play is quite concise and powerful, and full of the language style of the people on the grassland.
    A good play is the foundation for the success of the performance, but the success of this play also played a certain role in the director. We can see that the director's conception revolves around the central idea of the work, and it reveals the contradictions calmly and in a measured and layered manner, showing the theme and making the development of the plot very clear. The director's strength is to handle complex scenes in an orderly manner, and to handle sharply contested scenes in a simple and powerful manner. The most prominent example is that after Headman Jiaoba's beloved son was stabbed by the enemy, Headman Jiaoba wanted the work team to hand over the murderer. The director's handling of that scene was very brilliant. The director's handling of the mass scenes is also appropriate. He not only takes into account the symmetry and integrity of the picture, but also highlights individual characters in the mass scenes, even those who play a very small role in the play. For example, after the news that the work team was about to come to the Kangbu'er Grassland came, the scene where the masses were talking about it. Many characters were on stage for the first time, but through the director's very natural arrangement and scheduling, the characteristics of the thoughts and characters of these characters were shown. Because the director has a good grasp of the rhythm, mood and atmosphere of each scene, the whole play looks very varied and the color is also very rich. In the picturesque scenery, there is a very strong atmosphere of grassland life. The stage art design of this play is outstanding. Its style is unified, and the picture is simple but contains rich content; the color of the costumes and the background are also very coordinated.
    From the perspective of the entire play, some characters are still not well written. The girl Zhuomajie does not have a clear idea and character, and Zhang Jian is not written realistically enough. His words do not seem to be what he wants to say, but rather what the author arranged for him. Gao Nai and Jiaoba look like incarnations of concepts such as enlightened and unenlightened headmen. In addition, in the scene where Fang Zhen persuades Jinba Cailang not to go far away, Fang Zhen's words seem dry and weak. The author did not allow Fang Zhen to understand Jinba Cailang well and sympathize with Jinba Cailang from the bottom of his heart, so Fang Zhen's words were all correct, but they were also cold. The director has not paid good attention to the authenticity of these details when dealing with certain life details. For example, at the opening, Namuco and Zhuomajie came to the river to wash wool and absorb water, but none of them seriously did it; and at the opening of the second act, Wang Lin and Xiao Ding did not first focus on their work. This makes these scenes lack a credible atmosphere of life. The gorgeous costumes of Jinba Cailang and Namuco are not in line with their identities, and also violate the authenticity of life.
    "On the Kangbu'er Grassland," created and performed by the Gansu Provincial Drama Troupe, should be said to be excellent from the script to the performance. We believe that they will continue to work hard on the existing basis and will definitely be able to create more outstanding plays. (Attached picture)

    “在康布尔草原上”和它的演出
    作剧、演出：甘肃省话剧团　导演：武玉笑
    夏淳
    “在康布尔草原上”是甘肃省话剧团的集体创作，写的是黄河上游地区的藏族人民怎样在共产党的领导下粉碎了美蒋特务的阴谋，获得了永远的解放。它描绘了我们国家工作人员不怕艰难困苦，以无比的热情和信心完成党和国家交给的任务的工作精神和充满了乐观主义的高尚品质；同时也写出了藏族人民浑厚、勇敢的性格和勤劳、淳朴的生活。这个戏的特点是情节紧张，故事动人而优美，它歌颂了草原上人民的成长和胜利。
    作者在这部创作里不仅写出了一个紧张动人的故事，还刻划了一些很有色彩的人物。作者善于在鲜明的动作和突出的矛盾中刻划人物，并在突现矛盾刻划人物的同时，体现出党的政策的英明。作者很懂得戏剧艺术的特点。例如在开场不久，就通过工作组一个年青的组员小丁从小河里捉到一条鱼，这个很有动作性的事件，一下子就把剧中的主要人物——工作组的组长方振以及卡尔泰老爷爷和小丁三个人的性格、思想作了生动具体的描绘；同时，也使我们深深地感到党的政策精神在微小事物中的体现。在卡尔泰老爷爷买布的一场里，也具有同样的效果。
    作者刻划正面人物的成功，还在于把正面人物放在矛盾的最尖端来描写，这是非常有力的。例如：第二幕有些群众受了敌人的煽惑和欺骗，跑来质问工作组，并把他们给病人治病的药退回来，还要抢回从病人身上抽出来做化验用的血，这是一个非常难对付的局面。作者就把方振和卡尔泰老爷爷摆在那里，让他们面对着这样突然袭来的问题，必须去解决。再如：第四幕第一场，敌人用了最毒辣最阴狠的手段来破坏头人同工作组的关系，把头人唯一的爱子刺伤在工作组的帐篷前面。这时候，因为头人受了敌人的挑拨还没有完全相信工作组，碰到这种事情，他几乎完全失去了理智，便命令部下把工作组都抓起来，这是多么严重紧张的场面，作者把方振放在这样严重的关头，经受着考验。因之，突出地树立了方振这个正面人物的形象。
    就在上面所说的这样紧张的场面里，作者也没有忘记细致地刻划其他的人物，而这些人物又都是按照他们自己的思想行为的逻辑发展的。如在以上所说的这个场面，剧中的主要人物几乎都在场了（包括正面和反面的），每一个人物处在这种尖锐的矛盾中都有了进一步的发展，像工作组的副组长刘敏岗就被处理得非常恰当。在这场戏之前，刘敏岗刚刚因为自己思想上的错误，让敌人的鬼计得逞，使工作组处在更复杂困难的境地，受到了方振的批评，接着就发生了这件事。作者仅仅用了刘敏岗同焦巴头人相互之间的八句对话，就把刘敏岗的性格的发展表现出来了；使人们对他有了更完整的印象。作者就是这样刻划出了像方振、卡尔泰老爷爷、刘敏岗、小丁、道布等众多的正面和反面的人物。戏的对话相当简练有力，富有草原上人们的语言风格。
    一个好的剧作是演出成功的基础，但是这个戏的演出的成功，导演也起了一定的作用。我们看得出导演的构思是围绕着作品的中心思想，而且是从容不迫地有分寸、有层次地揭露矛盾，展现了主题，使剧情发展的脉络非常清晰。导演的长处是将复杂的场面处理得有条不紊，将斗争尖锐的场面处理得单纯有力。最突出的例子就是焦巴头人的爱子被敌人刺伤以后，焦巴头人要工作组交出凶手的那一场，导演的处理是很精彩的。导演对于群众场面的处理也是适当的，他不仅顾到画面的匀称，完整，而且能在群众场面中突出个别的人物，那怕是戏中占份量很轻的角色。例如：工作组就要到康布尔草原上来的消息传来以后，群众议论纷纷的那一场，许多人物都还是第一次上场，可是通过导演非常自然的安排和调度，就把这些人物的思想性格的特点表现了出来。由于导演较好地掌握了每一场戏的节奏、情调和气氛，使得整个戏看来很有变化，色调也很丰富。在美丽如画的景色里，洋溢着极浓烈的草原生活气息。这个戏的舞台美术设计是杰出的。它的格调统一，画面单纯却包藏了丰富的内容；服装的色彩和背景也是很协调的。
    从整个剧作来看，有些人物还是写的不够好的。卓玛杰这个女孩子没有明确的思想和性格，张健也写的不够真实，他的话好像都不是他自己要说的，而是作者替他安排的。高乃和焦巴两个头人看起来像是开明和不开明等概念的化身。另外在方振劝金巴才郎不要远走的那一场，方振的话显得枯燥无力。作者没有让方振很好的去了解金巴才郎，从心里同情金巴才郎，因此方振的语言都是正确的，却也都是冷冰冰的。导演在处理某些生活细节的时候，还没有很好的注意这些细节的真实性。例如开幕时娜姆错和卓玛杰两人到河边来是为了洗羊毛和吸水，可是他们谁都没有认真地去做；而第二幕开幕时王林和小丁也没有首先把注意力放在他们的工作上。这就使得这些场面缺乏令人可信的生活气息。金巴才郎和娜姆错的华丽的服装很不合乎他们的身份，也是违背生活的真实的。
    甘肃省话剧团创作和演出的“在康布尔草原上”，从剧本到演出都应该说是优秀的。我们相信他们在现有的基础上继续努力，一定能够创作出更出色的戏来。（附图片）
