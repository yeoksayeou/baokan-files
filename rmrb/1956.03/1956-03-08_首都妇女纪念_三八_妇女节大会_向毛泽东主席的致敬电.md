    Capital Women's Memorial Meeting for "March 8th" Women's Day
    Congratulatory Telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong

Respected Chairman Mao:

    As the women of our capital commemorate their own festival, as we cheer for the great victories of the motherland's socialist construction, we would like to extend our sincerest and most sublime respects to you – our dear leader and the helmsman of the Chinese revolution!

    Just as you said: "In the second half of 1955, a fundamental change took place in China's situation." Our country has achieved great victories in the socialist revolution, and these victories are inseparable from the wise and correct leadership of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and you. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and you, we will surely overcome all difficulties and build our country into a socialist country with a high level of industry, culture, and science. On the occasion of commemorating "March 8th" Women's Day, we firmly assure you that we will work a hundred times harder in our various positions and strive to be active members and role models in socialist construction, and together with the people of the city and the people of the country, we will strive to complete and overfulfill the first five-year plan ahead of schedule and build a socialist society!

    We wish you good health.

      The Capital Women's Memorial Meeting for "March 8th" International Women's Day
