    Do a Good Job in the Production and Supply of Farm Tools
    A letter from the First General Bureau of Production Materials of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives: After the "Reader's Letters" page published the letter "Hurry Up and Determine the Retail Prices of New-Style Farm Tools" on February 19th, the State Planning Commission, the Third Ministry of Machine Building Industry, and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives studied the issue and have issued a joint notice: the retail prices of new-style farm tools should be reduced and sold in accordance with the methods stipulated in 1955; and temporarily stipulate a certain range of ex-factory prices, so that factories and supply and marketing units can conduct temporary settlement, and then refund or make up the difference after the state officially stipulates the ex-factory price.

    A letter from the First Machinery Industry Administration Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry: The opinions of the Planning Section of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory on improving the design of the double-wheeled double-shared plow, published on the "Reader's Letters" page on January 15th, are very good. During the double-shared plow drawing revision meeting, we have made two designs for parts where hemp steel can be used to replace steel, so that each factory can choose according to different production conditions; we also let each factory fully discover problems and put forward opinions during small-batch trial production, so as to unify the revision.

    A letter from the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory: The opinions of Wu Xuanyang and Cui Baoyu in their letter on the "Reader's Letters" page on January 15th regarding the quality of the wooden rake bars of our factory's rocker-arm harvester are correct, and we are studying improvement methods.

    A letter from the Supply and Marketing Section of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory: Comrade Xiao Chen's opinion on the "Reader's Letters" page on January 15th that our factory's packaging costs for double-wheeled double-shared plows are relatively high is correct. Although we have taken some measures in this regard in the past, the packaging cost of the double-wheeled double-shared plow is higher than that of the Shanxi Machinery Factory and the Xuzhou Iron Factory. In the future, we will continue to improve our work and learn from the advanced experience of fraternal factories to make the packaging of double-wheeled double-shared plows both economical and good.

    做好农具的生产和供应工作
    中华全国供销合作总社生产资料第一总管理局来信：2月19日“读者来信专页”发表了“赶快确定新式农具的零售价格”的来信以后，国家计划委员会、第三机械工业部和全国供销合作总社对这个问题作了研究，已经发出联合通知：新式农具的零售价一律按1955年规定的办法降价出售；并且暂时规定有一定幅度的出厂价，以便工厂和供销单位临时进行结算，待国家正式规定出厂价格以后再多退少补。

    第一机械工业部第一机器工业管理局来信：1月15日“读者来信专页”上发表的北京农业机械厂计划科关于改进双轮双铧犁设计工作的意见是很好的。在双铧犁图纸修改会议过程中，我们已经把可以用麻钢代替钢材的零件都作出两种设计，以便各厂根据不同生产条件分别选用；还让各厂在小批试制中充分发现问题，提出意见，以便统一修正。

    北京农业机械厂来信：1月15日“读者来信专页”上吴宣扬、崔宝玉来信中对我厂摇臂式收割机木耙杆质量的意见是正确的，我们正在研究改进办法。

    北京农业机械厂供销科来信：1月15日“读者来信专页”上晓晨同志对我厂双轮双铧犁包装费用较高的意见是正确的。过去我们虽然已经在这方面采取了一些措施，但是双轮双铧犁的包装费用比山西机器厂和徐州铁工厂都要高。今后当继续改进工作，并且学习兄弟厂的先进经验，使双轮双铧犁的包装做到既省又好。
