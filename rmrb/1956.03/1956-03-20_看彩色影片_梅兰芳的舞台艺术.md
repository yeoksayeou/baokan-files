    Watching the Color Film "Mei Lanfang's Stage Art"
    Zhang Geng
    Director: Wu Zuguang, Assistant Director: Cen Fan, Produced by Beijing Film Studio

    In order to allow the broad masses of people to appreciate the outstanding performing arts of China's eminent artist, Mr. Mei Lanfang, and to pass them on to future generations, the Beijing Film Studio produced the color film "Mei Lanfang's Stage Art," which summarizes the development and brilliant achievements of Mr. Mei Lanfang's fifty-year artistic life, and records the most representative repertoire of this master of performing arts.

    "Mei Lanfang's Stage Art" was successfully produced with the strong assistance of Soviet photography expert Yakovlev and recording expert Golden. The film is divided into two parts, upper and lower. Currently being shown is the upper part, which includes Mei Lanfang's daily life, his social activities, and parts of his performance repertoire. From this, we not only appreciate Mei Lanfang's extremely moving performing arts; at the same time, we also deeply realize that Mei Lanfang's ability to achieve such high accomplishments in this field is by no means accidental. His dedication to his profession, his seriousness towards art, and his close connection with the masses are the main reasons for his success.

    Mr. Mei Lanfang has always engaged in theatrical work with a serious and earnest attitude. From the moment he embarked on the path of Peking Opera performance, he has continuously strived to learn, and even today, he never ceases his singing and martial arts practice. In the film, we see a scene of him practicing sword dancing attentively in the courtyard early in the morning. This spirit of tireless dedication is very worthy of serious study by younger actors. We also see him painting in his spare time in the film. As a performing artist, his ability not to confine himself within a narrow world, and to explore various arts, undoubtedly helps his own artistic accomplishments. Mei Lanfang's ability to become a creative artist is greatly related to his ability to widely absorb artistic nourishment from all aspects.

    Mei Lanfang's ability to possess such rich creativity in performing arts is particularly due to his close connection with the masses. He once said: "Actors can never be separated from the audience. The needs of the audience change with the times. The reform of actors in drama must be coordinated with the needs of the audience..." These words are conclusions he reached through personal practice. The film shows Mr. Mei enduring hardship to perform for the masses in North Korea, Guangzhou, Anshan, and other places. Such extensive contact with new audiences, listening to their opinions, and understanding their demands, has further enriched the content of Mr. Mei's performing arts.

    In the film, we saw the two plays "Broken Bridge" and "The Story of Zhao Yanrong". The artist, in his sixties, still looks so young in front of the camera. In addition to thanking the hard work of the director and photographer, his delicate and moving performance is the main reason. He has a good grasp of the mental state of the protagonists in the plays – Bai Suzhen and Zhao Yanrong. Especially in "The Story of Zhao Yanrong," one feels that his creation in the film is a step forward compared to his past stage performances. In the past, on the stage, Zhao Yanrong's madness in the "Writing the Memorial" scene was mostly due to the instructions of the mute servant, somewhat passive. Therefore, when seeing the "Golden Palace" scene, with Zhao Yanrong acting mad alone, one slightly felt that the continuity of the characters before and after was somewhat insufficient. However, in the film, Zhao Yanrong emphasized the initiative in the "Writing the Memorial" scene, making people feel that she and the mute servant jointly devised a way to deal with this dangerous struggle by feigning madness. This connects with the character in the "Golden Palace" scene.

    The filming of these two plays is quite successful, especially the play "The Story of Zhao Yanrong". It fully utilizes the expressive features of film art, preserving the original appearance of Mr. Mei's stage performance, and compensating for the limitations on the stage. This play is artistically complete from both a film and opera perspective. In particular, through some close-up shots, the film vividly displays Mei Lanfang's delicate facial expressions in front of the audience, which greatly strengthens the audience's understanding of the characters' inner activities and increases the artistic appeal of the entire play.

    The film's art design is also quite good. The costume colors of "Broken Bridge" are fresh and elegant, matching the antique backdrop; it looks very harmonious, indeed giving people a lot of beauty. It can be seen that the two different scenes of "The Story of Zhao Yanrong" have also been carefully arranged. This is not easy to do in Peking Opera, especially in the case of Peking Opera being filmed.

    However, the film is not without its shortcomings. I think that "Broken Bridge" is relatively fragmented in terms of filming and editing, not as complete, clear, and coherent as "The Story of Zhao Yanrong." At the same time, necessary close-up shots are also very few. This may be because most of the shots of "The Story of Zhao Yanrong" are focused on Zhao Nu, while "Broken Bridge" is distributed among the three characters? In short, watching "Broken Bridge" in the movie feels that the emotions are not as consistent as on the stage. In addition, when Peking Opera is moved from the stage to the screen, is it necessary to make additions and deletions? For example, in "The Story of Zhao Yanrong," in the "Golden Palace" scene, it seems that the scene of Zhao Nu getting off the sedan can be omitted. Of course, Mr. Mei has a very beautiful posture when getting off the sedan; but here, since there is a relatively realistic palace setting, and then using that symbolic sedan, it is easy to make people feel disharmonious, and getting on and off the sedan in the Golden Palace also seems inappropriate.

    From the film "Mei Lanfang's Stage Art," we deeply feel that the vitality of Peking Opera art is very strong, and Mr. Mei Lanfang's outstanding achievements in artistic work have given us a vivid example. As long as younger actors learn from Mr. Mei's spirit of tireless effort and continue to create, the future development of Peking Opera art will surely be bright and brilliant.

    看彩色影片“梅兰芳的舞台艺术”
    张庚
    导演：吴祖光　副导演：岑范　北京电影制片厂出品
    为了使我国卓越的艺术家——梅兰芳先生的优秀的表演艺术能够为广大人民所欣赏，并且能够留传给后代，北京电影制片厂拍摄了彩色影片“梅兰芳的舞台艺术”，概括地介绍了梅兰芳先生五十年来艺术生活的发展过程和辉煌成就，记录了这位表演艺术大师最具有代表性的演出剧目。
    “梅兰芳的舞台艺术”是在苏联摄影专家雅可福列夫和录音专家戈尔登的大力帮助下摄制成功的。影片分为上、下两集。目前放映的是上集，其中包括梅兰芳的日常生活、他的社会活动、以及他演出的部分剧目等内容。从这里面，我们不仅欣赏了梅兰芳的极其动人的表演艺术；同时，也深深体会到，梅兰芳在这方面能够得到这样高的成就，决不是偶然的。他对于业务的钻研，他对待艺术的严肃性，他和群众的密切联系等等，是他获得成功的主要原因。
    梅兰芳先生一直是以认真严肃的态度来从事演剧劳动的。从他踏上京剧表演的道路以后，他就不断努力学习，甚至在今天，他也从不间歇在歌唱和武功方面的练习。从影片里面，我们看到他清晨在院子里专心一意练习舞剑的镜头。这种孜孜不倦的钻研精神，是非常值得后辈演员们认真学习的。从影片里面我们还看到他利用闲暇的时间绘画的情景。作为一个表演艺术家，他能够不把自己拘束于一个狭小的天地以内，能够对多种艺术进行探求，这无疑对于他本身艺术造诣是有帮助的。梅兰芳能够成为一个富有创造力的艺术家，和他能广泛地吸收来自各方面的艺术养料有着很大关系。
    梅兰芳在表演艺术上能够具有这样丰富的创造力，特别因为他和群众有着密切的联系。他曾经说过：“演员是永远离不开观众的。观众的需要，随时代而变迁。演员在戏剧上的改革，一定要配合观众的需要来做……”。这些话，都是他在亲身实践中得到的结论。影片表现了梅先生不怕吃苦，到朝鲜、广州、鞍山等地为群众演出的情形。这样广泛地接触新的观众，听取他们的意见，了解他们的要求，也就更加丰富了梅先生的表演艺术的内容。
    在影片里面，我们看到了“断桥”和“宇宙锋”这两个戏。六十多岁的艺术家在镜头前面仍然显得那么年青，这除了应该感谢导演和摄影师的辛勤劳动外，他的细致动人的表演是更主要的原因。他对于戏中主角——白素贞和赵艳容的精神状态是掌握得很好的。特别是在“宇宙锋”里面，使人感到他在影片里的创造比在过去舞台演出的时候又前进了一步。过去在舞台上，“修本”一场赵艳容的装疯多半是由于哑奴的指使，多少是被动的，因而看到
  “金殿”一场，只由赵艳容一个人来装疯，就略微感到前后的性格贯串有些不够。但是在影片里面，赵艳容在“修本”一场强调了主动，使人感到是她和哑奴共同设法用装疯来对付这场险恶的斗争的，这就和“金殿”一场的人物性格连贯起来了。
    影片对这两个戏的拍摄是相当成功的，特别是对“宇宙锋”这一个戏。它充分运用了电影艺术的表现特点，既保存了梅先生舞台演出的原有面目，又补足了舞台上受到限制的地方。这个戏无论从电影或戏曲角度来看，在艺术上都是很完整的。特别是影片通过一些特写镜头，把梅兰芳的细腻的面部表情动人地展示在观众面前，这就大大加强了观众对人物内心活动的理解，也增加了整个戏的艺术感染力量。
    影片在美术设计方面也是相当好的。“断桥”的服装色彩清丽、淡雅，和古色古香的后景相配；显得非常和谐，的确给人许多美感。“宇宙锋”的两个不同的场景看得出来也是经过煞费苦心的布置的。这在京戏，特别是京戏拍成电影的场合下是不容易做到的。
    然而影片也还不是没有缺点。我觉得“断桥”在摄制、剪接方面就比较零散，不如“宇宙锋”那么完整、清楚、一气呵成。同时必要的一些特写镜头也很少。这也许是由于“宇宙锋”绝大多数的镜头都集中拍摄赵女，而“断桥”却是分散在三个角色身上的缘故吧？总之，看电影里的“断桥”就觉着情绪上不像舞台上那么一贯到底。此外，京戏从舞台搬上银幕的时候，是不是也必须有所增损？比方“宇宙锋”中“金殿”一场，赵女上场的时候似乎就可以省去下车一段。固然梅先生在下车的时候有一个很美丽的身段；但是在这里既然有了比较写实的宫殿的布景，又用那象征的车辇，就容易使人感到不调和，而且在金殿上下车似乎也不妥当。
    从“梅兰芳的舞台艺术”这部影片里面，我们深深感到京剧艺术的生命力是很强的，梅兰芳先生在艺术劳动上的卓越成就就给了我们生动的例证。只要后辈演员学习梅先生的努力不懈的精神，不断创造，京剧艺术的发展前途一定是光辉灿烂的。
