Among them are Cao Junjie, a young train driver skilled in rapid axle overloads; Jiang Jizhou, a driver from the Suihua Locomotive Depot who has had no accidents in nine years; Zhuang Minggeng, a nationally renowned advanced lathe operator from the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, who has completed five years of work in two years and eight months and is striving to complete seven years of work in four years; Luo Xiaocun, an old engineer in his sixties, whose rationalization proposals in design saved the Baoji-Chengdu Railway project more than 60 million yuan; Wu Chengshan, an engineer who improved the method of repairing stone arch bridges; Liu Yunhe, a blasting expert who built the Baoji-Chengdu Railway; Zhang Yanqing, a dispatcher skilled in organizing fast traction axle overload trains; Dong Diange, a car inspector who created a new record of 1,200 accident-free days; and Luo Qinming, a female train conductor who enthusiastically serves passengers.

In his report to the conference, Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan introduced the deeds of many advanced producers. He said that thousands upon thousands of advanced producers have emerged among the railway workers in the socialist competition. The representatives attending the meeting today were selected from among them. In the selection process, almost all units summarized advanced experiences, which were then technically and mass appraised, and later the Ministry of Railways summarized 197 of the most critical and important advanced experiences. These experiences should be promoted throughout the national railways by the representatives present, in order to mobilize railway workers across the country to further develop the socialist competition and strive to complete and overfulfill the railway transportation and new railway construction tasks of the first five-year plan more, faster, better and more economically.

Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Hu Keshi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, Xu Guangping, Vice Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and Wang Zhen, Commander of the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, all attended today's meeting to congratulate the advanced producers on their achievements.

Also attending today's meeting was a Soviet railway delegation headed by Ugarov, Vice Chairman of the Scientific and Technical Conference of the Soviet Ministry of Transport.

Xinhua News Agency, March 20th: In 1955, the national railway workers saved more than 300 million yuan for the country. This was announced by Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan at the National Railway Advanced Producers Representative Conference that opened today. He said that if this money were used to build new railways, it could build 600 kilometers; if it were used to build general houses, it could build 6 million square meters.
