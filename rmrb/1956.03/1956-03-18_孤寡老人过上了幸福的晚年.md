A Happy Late Life for Lonely Old People
Let Life Be Forever Like Spring
Editor:
    I am a 76-year-old widow. In October 1955, I joined the Xuguang Agricultural Production Cooperative. In the beginning, I had many concerns: I am so old, what if I cannot work? What worried me particularly was, what would I live on in the future when the land dividend is cancelled? Later, the cooperative explained to me that the agricultural production cooperative would definitely make the lives of widowed and lonely old people better than before, so I joined the cooperative.
    After joining the cooperative, my life was indeed much better than before: the cooperative assessed an annual living allowance of 70 yuan for me, which is twice as high as my previous income from renting land. The firewood I burn at home is completely supplied by the cooperative, and young cooperative members take turns helping me fetch water. If I want to buy something, a cooperative member will immediately do it for me. Not only that, the Party branch secretary, the cooperative director, and the production team leader often come to ask me about problems in my life that need to be solved, and the cooperative members treat me like a family member, affectionately calling me "Grandma Fan Wu." I no longer feel like a lonely old woman!
    What particularly moved me was the scene of celebrating the Spring Festival this year. In previous years, I couldn't afford anything for the Spring Festival and could only spend this day alone and quietly. Before the Spring Festival this year, the cooperative built me a new stove, bought a new water tank and a lot of rice, oil, salt, fish, meat, etc., and also bought two strings of firecrackers. The New Year's Eve passed lively, and on the Spring Festival day, the township head Yu Longhua also led many cooperative members to wish me a Happy New Year!
    In the old society, I suffered all kinds of pain and hardships, and lived in tears all the time. Now, the Communist Party has liberated me, and the agricultural production cooperative has given me a hope in my old age. My life is getting better and better, and happier and happier. Therefore, I gave myself a name called "Fan Changchun," meaning to make life as happy as spring forever.
    Although I am old and my legs cannot walk, I can still do some light work. I ask the cooperative to allow me to participate in looking after chickens and ducks, so that I can contribute a little bit to socialism.

No Need to Rely on a Watch for Old Age Anymore
Editor:
    At the members' meeting of the First Agricultural Production Cooperative of Xinhai Village, Hailin District, Hailin County, Heilongjiang Province, which announced the completion of a completely socialist cooperative, 71-year-old member Zhou Meixiang took out a watch that he had kept for ten years as an investment in the cooperative.
    Zhou Meixiang is an old man without a family, no children, and no relatives. In 1945, when the Japanese invaders were defeated, he picked up a watch in Hailin County. At that time, he planned to sell the watch and have someone send him back to his hometown in Shandong when he was about to die. Therefore, he treasured this watch, wrapping it in more than a dozen layers, and specially nailed a small wooden box to hold it, and placed it in a secret place. He had never talked to anyone about this matter for ten years.
    Last autumn, Zhou Meixiang joined the cooperative. In December, when the cooperative was mobilizing new members to invest, everyone knew that Zhou Meixiang's life was relatively difficult and did not ask him to invest. However, Zhou Meixiang thought of the care the cooperative had given him since he joined: he was always assigned light work, the young women in the cooperative often helped him sew and wash clothes, and the young members treated him like an old grandfather…; therefore, he also wanted to invest a little in the cooperative and do his best. But what to use as an investment? After thinking about it, he thought of the watch. He struggled in his mind for a long time, fearing that if he took out the watch, he would have no one to rely on for his livelihood, death and burial in the future. Finally, he decided to wait and see.
    Soon, Zhou Meixiang heard the cooperative's publicity about the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), and learned that agricultural cooperatives would provide food, clothing, fuel, education, and burial for the widowed, lonely, old, weak, and disabled, and he finally felt relieved. Therefore, at the meeting where the agricultural cooperative announced that it had been transformed into a completely socialist cooperative, he excitedly stood up and said: "I want to offer a treasure to everyone!" He took out the watch that he had kept for ten years and said: "Before, I always relied on this watch to support my old age. Now I know that the cooperative is my home, and I am no longer a lonely old man without a family. I don't have to hide this watch anymore. Sell it and use it as my share fund for joining the advanced cooperative!" Lu Fengshan

Disabled Elderly Man Gets Cared For
Editor:
    In Chonghe Township, Fusu County, Guangxi, we saw a lonely and helpless disabled elderly man who was spending a happy old age under the care of the agricultural production cooperative.
    This old man is Huang Xiankuan, who is already 65 years old this year. When he was 12 years old, both of his legs were paralyzed. At the age of 25, he became a ferryman, rowing a boat every day while sitting down, and has been doing it for 40 years. In December 1955, the township established a completely socialist agricultural production cooperative. Due to collective production, the number of people using the ferry increased day by day. The Party branch considered that Huang Xiankuan was old and disabled, and that it was too tiring for him to be in charge of rowing the boat, and that accidents could easily occur. Therefore, it was decided that the agricultural production cooperative would be responsible for supporting him. When Huang Xiankuan first heard this news, he was afraid that he would have no food to eat if he didn't row the boat, and he was worried for several nights. Later, the township head personally explained to him the principle that the cooperative would provide food, clothing, fuel, education, and burial for the widowed, lonely, old, weak, and disabled, and he finally felt relieved.
    At the end of December 1955, the cooperative gave him part of his living expenses and a brand-new cotton-padded jacket -- wearing a new cotton-padded jacket was a first for him in his life. Before the Spring Festival, the cooperative sent him some rice and firewood, and decided to give him 600 jin of rice a year, and also gave him 30 yuan to buy oil, salt, and vegetables. He said gratefully: "Only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can I live such a happy life today."

### 孤寡老人过上了幸福的晚年

    孤寡老人过上了幸福的晚年
    让生活永远像春天一样编辑同志：
    我是一个76岁的孤老婆婆。1955年10月，我参加了旭光农业生产合作社。在开始的时候，我有不少的顾虑：我年纪那么大了，做不动活怎么办呢？特别使我担心的是，将来取消了土地分红，我的生活靠什么过呢？后来，社里向我说明，农业生产合作社一定会让孤寡老人的生活过得比以前更好，于是我就入了社。
    入社以后，我的生活果真比过去好得多了：社里评定一年给我70元钱的生活费，这比我过去出租土地的收入就要高二倍；我家里烧的柴完全由社里供给，青年社员们轮流帮我挑水，我想买一点东西只要一张嘴马上就有社员来代办。不但如此，党支部书记、社主任和生产队长经常关切地来问我生活上有什么需要解决的问题，社员们也都把我当作家里人一样，亲热地叫我“范五奶”。我再也不感觉自己是一个孤老婆婆了！
    特别使我感动的是今年过春节的情景。往年春节，我什么东西也买不起，只能一个人冷清清地度过这一天。今年春节以前，社里就替我起了一个新灶，买了一口新水缸和不少米，油、盐、鱼、肉等，还买了两挂鞭炮。大除夕热热闹闹地过去了，春节那天，乡长余龙化还领了好多社员来给我拜年！
    旧社会我受尽了痛苦和磨难，一直在泪水里过日子。现在，共产党使我翻了身，农业生产合作社使我晚年有了指靠，日子愈过愈好，愈过愈快活。因此，我起了一个名字叫“范长春”，意思是要让日子永远过得像春天一样的幸福。
    我虽然年纪大了，腿走不动了，但是我还能做一点轻活。我要求社里允许我参加看鸡、看鸭，也好让我为社会主义尽一点点力量。

    不必再指望手表养老了编辑同志：
    在黑龙江省海林县海林区新海村第一农业生产合作社宣布建成完全社会主义性质的社员大会上，71岁的老社员周美祥拿出了他已经保存十年的一块手表作为对社里的投资。
    周美祥是一个没家没业、没儿没女的老人。1945年日本侵略者被击溃的时候，他在海林县城里拣到了一个手表。当时他打算在自己有个三长两短的时候，把表卖了让人把他送回山东老家去。因此，他把这块手表当成宝贝似的，里三层、外三层地包了十多层，又特意钉了个小木匣装上，放在一个秘密的地方。这件事情，十年来他从来没跟任何人谈过。
    去年秋天，周美祥入了社。12月，社里在动员新社员投资的时候，大家知道周美祥生活比较困难，没有要他投资。可是，周美祥想起入社以后社里对他的照顾：做活总是分配轻活给他干，社里的青年妇女经常帮他缝洗衣服，年青的社员对他像老爷爷似地……；因此，他也想给社里投一点资，尽尽自己的心意。但是，用什么来作投资呢？想来想去，就想到那块手表。他思想斗争了好久，怕把表拿出来以后，将来生养死葬没依靠，最后决定还是先看看再说。
    不久，周美祥听到了社里对全国农业发展纲要（草案）的宣传，知道农业社对鳏寡孤独老弱残疾的人，要做到保吃、保穿、保烧、保教、保葬，心里终于踏实了。因此，在农业社宣布已经转为完全社会主义性质的大会上，他激动地站了起来说：“我要向大家献宝！”他拿出了已经保存十年的这块手表，并且说：“早先我总指望着这块表养我的老。这回我知道了，合作社就是我的家，我不再是没家没业的孤老头子了。我再也不必把这块手表藏东藏西了，把它卖了做我入高级社的股份基金吧！”　鲁逢山
    残废老人得到了照顾编辑同志：
    我们在广西扶绥县充禾乡下洞村，看见一个孤苦无依的残废老人，在农业生产合作社的照顾下安度着幸福的晚年。
    这个老人叫黄显宽，今年已经65岁了。他在12岁那年，两只脚就都瘫痪了。到25岁的时候，他当上了渡船船工，每天坐着划船，到现在已经整整干了40年。1955年12月，乡里建立了完全社会主义性质的农业生产合作社。由于集体生产，坐渡船来往的人一天比一天多。党支部考虑到黄显宽年纪大了，又是残废人，担负划船的工作太累，而且还容易发生事故。因此，就决定由农业生产合作社负责赡养他。黄显宽刚听到这个消息，害怕不撑船会没有饭吃，愁得几个晚上睡不着觉。后来，乡长亲自对他说清楚了社里对鳏寡孤独老弱残废的人要做到保吃、保穿、保烧、保教、保葬的道理，他才放下了心。
    1955年12月底，社里就给他一部分生活费用和一件崭新的棉袄——穿新棉袄，这对他说来还是生平第一次。春节前，社里给他送去了一些大米和烧柴，并且决定一年给他600斤稻谷，还给他30元钱买油、盐、菜吃。他感激地说：“只有在共产党和毛主席的领导下，我才能过今天这样幸福的日子。”
