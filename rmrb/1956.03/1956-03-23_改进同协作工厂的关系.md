Improving Relations with Collaborating Factories
Han Guang, Director of the Collaboration Production Department, First Automobile Works

The First Automobile Works requires 44 brother factories to supply 410 types of collaborative products. The vast majority of these products need to undergo trial production before formal production.

Over the past two years, thanks to the efforts of collaborating factories, 292 types of collaborative products have been successfully trial-produced, while the remaining 118 are in the process of trial production or undergoing appraisal. To ensure that these collaborative products are trial-produced or appraised on schedule, the efforts of the collaborating factories are certainly needed, but we also need to improve our own work.

What shortcomings have we had in the trial production and production preparation of collaborative products over the past two years?

One, the implementation of trial production contracts is not serious or conscientious, and we have not coordinated well with the trial production work of collaborating factories. For example, the Shanghai Yaohua Glass Factory had difficulties in controlling dimensional tolerance accuracy in the trial production of tempered glass. We had already agreed to make samples on their behalf, and according to the trial production contract, the samples should have been supplied before June 20, 1955. However, we delayed the supply until the end of November 1955, and the samples were unusable. We only sent someone to Shanghai for repairs in February of this year. The stamping dies we made for the Beijing First Automobile Accessories Factory were scheduled to be completed by the end of 1955, but were delayed until February of this year, and have not yet been completely delivered. We have also repeatedly changed the quantity of samples and semi-finished products required from collaborating factories for appraisal, which has hindered some factories from completing trial production or appraisal work on time.

Two, technical data was not supplied in a timely manner, and the mastery of technical conditions was inappropriate. Drawings and other materials for various automotive electrical appliances supplied by our factory to collaborating factories were not completely supplied until the first and second quarters of last year. The impregnation and other technological data for the two types of cardboard trial-produced by the Jilin Paper Mill were translated by us in December 1955, but were not sent in time, and were only sent in February of this year. The Nanjing Automobile Parts Factory is trial-producing clutch friction plates for our factory. After we sent the original drawings in July 1954, the original design unit had already modified the sample size, but we delayed telling the Nanjing Automobile Parts Factory about the modification for six months, which not only prolonged the trial production period, but also caused losses to the collaborating factory. We incorrectly judged the size of the low-voltage wires trial-produced by the Shanghai Wire Factory as unqualified, when in fact the samples fully met the technical conditions. This has caused a waste of manpower and resources.

Three, at the beginning, we had too much control over the technical requirements and product design of the collaborating factories. We wanted to control the general assembly drawing and the individual part drawings, that is, to control all changes in the design of the drawings and the substitution of materials. This affected the design work of the collaborating factories and made the responsibilities of both parties unclear. The two sides were unable to sign trial production contracts for a long time because of this issue. In fact, we should not control the design of the individual part drawings of collaborative products. We only corrected this shortcoming in March 1955 after a suggestion from a Soviet chief design expert.

Four, we should supply 20 kinds of metal parts to the collaborating factories, and then the collaborating factories will process them into assemblies and supply them to our factory. However, we have only delivered two kinds so far, and 18 kinds have not been delivered on time. This has already hindered the trial production work of many factories.

Five, we have not provided the collaborating factories with long-term collaboration plans in a timely manner, which has prevented the collaborating factories from carrying out long-term planning effectively, and has made it difficult to carry out production preparation and necessary basic construction. As a result, although some collaborative products have been successfully trial-produced, they still cannot be supplied in large quantities.

In order to overcome the above shortcomings, we have already formulated an overall plan for internal and external coordination. We have requested the Automobile Industry Administration Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry and the State Planning Commission to include collaborative products in the national plan, so that the production of collaborative products can be arranged at the same time as the state assigns production tasks to the automobile manufacturing factory, and the internal and external production collaboration can be linked together through the national plan. In order to strengthen technical assistance to collaborating factories and improve collaborative relations, we have included all the tools, dies, and technical data that we should provide to collaborating factories in the factory's internal plan, and have required the relevant units within the factory to complete them within a time limit. We take the initiative to contact collaborating factories, learn from them with an open mind, and do a good job in collaborative relations. At the same time, we conduct in-depth research on technical data, clarify technical requirements, carefully and promptly test and appraise samples, and better strive for the guidance of Soviet experts.

We believe that as long as our factory closely cooperates with the collaborating factories, keeps in step, and strictly abides by the contracts, collaborative products can be supplied on time, ensuring the needs of the early production of domestically produced automobiles and the large-scale production in the future.

### 改进同协作工厂的关系

    改进同协作工厂的关系
    第一汽车制造厂协作生产处处长　韩光
    第一汽车制造厂需要四十四个兄弟厂供应四百一十种协作产品。这些产品的绝大部分，在正式生产以前都要进行试制。
    两年多来，由于协作工厂的努力，已经试制成功二百九十二种协作产品，其余的一百十八种正在试制或鉴定中。要保证这些协作产品按期试制或鉴定好，当然需要协作工厂的努力，但是，也需要我们改进自己的工作。
    我们两年来在协作产品试制和生产准备工作中有那些缺点呢？
    一、执行试制合同不严肃不认真，没有很好配合协作厂的试制工作。如上海耀华玻璃厂试制钢化玻璃，对掌握尺寸公差精度有困难，我们已经同意代作样板，按试制合同规定应该在1955年6月20日前供应样板，但是，拖延到1955年11月底才供应，而且样板不合用，今年二月才派人去上海修理。我们代北京第一汽车附件厂制造的冲模，按计划应在1955年底完成，但是拖延到今年二月才做，现在还没完全送去。我们要求协作厂送交供鉴定用的样品和半成品的数量，也一再更改，以致妨碍一部分工厂按时完成试制工作或鉴定工作。
    二、没及时供应技术资料，对技术条件的掌握不当。我厂供应各协作厂的各项汽车电器的图纸等资料，到去年一、二季才先后供应完毕。吉林造纸厂试制的两种纸板用的浸渍等工艺资料，我们在1955年12月翻译完毕后，没及时寄去，到今年二月份才送去。南京汽车制配厂为我厂试制离合器摩擦片，我们于1954年7月把原文图送去以后，原设计单位已经把样品尺寸修改了，但是我们拖了六个月才把修改的情况告诉南京汽车制配厂，不但延长了试制的期限，而且给协作厂造成损失。我们鉴定上海电线厂试制的低压线的尺寸，曾错误地认为不合格，实际上样品是完全符合技术条件的。这就造成了人力物力的浪费。
    三、开始的时候，我们对各协作厂的技术要求和产品设计的控制范围太大，要控制总图和另件图，即对全部图纸设计的变动以及材料的代用等都加以控制。这就影响协作厂的设计工作，并且使得双方责任不清。双方因为这个问题曾经长期不能签订试制合同。实际上，我们对协作产品的分图的设计是不应该控制的。到1955年三月，苏联总设计专家提出建议后，我们才纠正这个缺点。
    四、有二十种金属另件应该由我们厂供应协作厂，再由协作厂加工成合件后供应我们厂。但是，现在我们只交出两种，还有十八种没按时交出。这已经妨碍许多厂的试制工作。
    五、我们没有向协作厂及时交代长期协作方案，因而使得各协作厂不能很好地进行长远规划，生产准备和必要的基本建设也难以开展，以致有些协作品虽然试制成功，还是不能大量供应。
    为了克服以上缺点、我们已经拟定厂内外配合的整体计划，请第一机械工业部汽车工业管理局和国家计划委员会把协作品列入国家计划，以便国家给汽车制造厂布置生产任务的同时，布置协作产品的生产，用国家计划把厂内外的生产协作连结起来。为了加强对协作厂的技术援助，改进协作关系，凡是我们应该供给协作厂的工模具、技术资料等，我们都把它们列入厂内计划，并且要求厂内有关单位限期完成。我们主动同协作厂联系，虚心向协作厂学习，搞好协作关系。同时，我们深入研究技术资料，明确技术要求，慎重地及时地试验鉴定样品，更好地争取苏联专家的指导。
    我们觉得，只要我厂同协作厂密切配合，步调一致，严格遵守合同，协作产品就可以按时供应，保证提前出产国产汽车和今后大量生产的需要。
