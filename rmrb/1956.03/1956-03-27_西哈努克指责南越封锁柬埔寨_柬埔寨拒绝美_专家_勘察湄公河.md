Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 26th -- Phnom Penh dispatch: Cambodian Prime Minister Sihanouk accused South Vietnam of imposing an economic blockade on Cambodia at a press conference on the 25th. He said, "The South Vietnamese government took this measure after my visit to Beijing. There is nothing to justify this cunning action."

Sihanouk said, "My trip to Beijing was neither a criminal act nor an act of treason. If neutrality is a crime, then Switzerland and Sweden are also criminals."

The Prime Minister rejected Thailand's accusation that Cambodian "pirates" disguised as police and soldiers had invaded Thailand. He said that Thailand's accusation was "a bad joke."

Sihanouk said that after the border blockade, Cambodia would pursue a self-sufficient policy and cancel some imports. At the same time, he said that Cambodia was willing to accept "any sincere compromise" with South Vietnam and Thailand. Sihanouk said that unless South Vietnam lifted the economic blockade, he would not be willing to establish diplomatic relations with Saigon.

Xinhua News Agency, March 26th -- According to All India Radio, Thai Prime Minister Pibul Songgram revealed at a press conference on March 23rd that during the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's military exercises last month, Cambodia refused to allow aircraft of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization countries to cross its airspace to Thailand.

Pibul said that Cambodia also refused to allow US and Thai survey teams surveying the Mekong River to measure the Mekong River section within Cambodia.

According to Bangkok newspapers, the Mekong River survey work, which had already been carried out in Thailand and Laos, has been temporarily suspended because the Royal Government of Cambodia refused to allow American "experts" to enter Cambodia to survey the Mekong River.

According to newspaper reports, the Royal Government of Cambodia pointed out in a notice that the survey work on the Mekong River within Cambodia should be the sole responsibility of the Royal Government of Cambodia. If the United States intends to provide assistance, it should contact the Royal Government of Cambodia directly.

    西哈努克指责南越封锁柬埔寨
    柬埔寨拒绝美“专家”勘察湄公河
    新华社河内26日电　金边消息：柬埔寨王国首相西哈努克二十五日在记者招待会上指责南越对柬埔寨实行经济封锁。他说，“南越政府在我访问北京以后采取了这个措施。没有什么东西可以说明这种狡猾行动是有道理的。”
    西哈努克说，“我到北京去既不是一件犯罪行为，也不是一件卖国行为。如果中立是犯罪的话，那末瑞士和瑞典也都是罪犯。”
    这位首相驳回了泰国指控柬埔寨的“海盗”乔装警察和士兵侵入泰国一事。他说，泰国的指控是“一种恶劣的玩笑”。
    西哈努克说，在封锁边境以后，柬埔寨将奉行一种自给自足的政策和取消一些进口。他同时表示，柬埔寨愿意接受与南越和泰国的“任何真诚的妥协办法”。西哈努克说，除非南越取消经济封锁，否则他不愿和西贡建立外交关系。
    新华社26日讯　据全印广播电台广播，泰国总理銮披汶三月二十三日在记者招待会上透露，在上月东南亚条约组织举行军事演习的时候，柬埔寨拒绝允许东南亚条约国家的飞机越过它的领空飞往泰国。
    銮披汶说，柬埔寨也拒绝允许美国和泰国勘测湄公河的勘测队测量柬埔寨境内湄公河部分。
    据曼谷报纸报道，由于柬埔寨王国政府拒绝了美国“专家”进入柬埔寨境内勘察湄公河，原来已经在泰国和老挝进行的湄公河勘察工作暂告停顿。
    报纸消息说，柬埔寨王国政府在通知中指出，在柬埔寨境内湄公河的勘察工作应当由柬埔寨王国政府独自负责。如果美国打算给予协助，就应当直接同柬埔寨王国政府接洽。
