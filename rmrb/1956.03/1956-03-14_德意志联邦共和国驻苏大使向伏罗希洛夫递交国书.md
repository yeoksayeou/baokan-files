Xinhua News Agency, Moscow (TASS dispatch) – On March 12th, in the Moscow Kremlin, the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Voroshilov, accepted the credentials presented by Wilhelm Haas, the first ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany to the Soviet Union.

	When presenting his credentials, Haas delivered a eulogy, saying that the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, in their exchange of letters in September of last year, unanimously expressed their deep conviction that the establishment of diplomatic relations would help resolve the fundamental national issue of the entire German people – the restoration of the unity of the German democratic state. I am deeply convinced that this hope will be realized. Moreover, the current mutual dispatch of diplomatic representatives at the level of Ambassadors Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary will be a genuine step forward on this path.

	In his reply, Voroshilov said, "We believe that there are now all the conditions for establishing good and friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany. Good cooperation between our two countries is beneficial and necessary for both the Soviet and German peoples. Such cooperation is also very important for our neighbors, for the defense of peace, and for the security of the whole of Europe. The development of understanding and trust in the relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany will also greatly promote the resolution of outstanding international issues of common interest and will help to solve the problem of restoring the unity of the German democratic state."

    德意志联邦共和国驻苏大使向伏罗希洛夫递交国书
    新华社据塔斯社莫斯科讯　苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫，3月12日在莫斯科克里姆林宫接受了德意志联邦共和国首任驻苏大使威廉·哈斯递交的国书。
    在递交国书时，哈斯致颂词说，德意志联邦共和国总理和苏联部长会议主席在去年9月间互换的信件中一致表示深信：外交关系的建立将有助于解决全体德国人民的基本民族问题——恢复德意志民主国家的统一。我深信，这个希望将会得到实现。而且目前互派特命全权大使级的外交代表，将是在这条道路上真正迈进一步。
    伏罗希洛夫致答词说，我们认为，现在有一切条件使苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间建立良好的友好关系。我们两国之间的良好合作对苏联人民和德国人民说来都是有利的和必要的。这种合作对我们的邻国、对保卫和平和整个欧洲的安全也是十分重要的。苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间的关系中的谅解和信任的发展，同样将大大促进有关共同利益的悬而未决的国际问题的解决，将有助于解决恢复德意志民主国家的统一的问题。
