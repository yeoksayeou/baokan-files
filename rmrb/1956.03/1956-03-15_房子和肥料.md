	Houses and Fertilizer
	Wu Erxiang

	After the agricultural production cooperative in Shicao Township, Dianbai County, Guangdong Province, transformed into an advanced cooperative, it formulated a plan to build houses. They will ensure that all farmers in the township live in new houses within three years.

	The houses in Shicao Township are all built with mud bricks, and most have a history of over 100 years, some even experiencing over 200 years of wind and rain. The mud bricks themselves are not very strong, and after years of wind and erosion, most of them are dilapidated. Some houses have cracks in the walls more than a foot wide, and they rattle in the wind and rain, with dirt constantly falling down.

	These mud bricks, because of long-term smoke and weathering, contain rich fertilizer. Last year, farmer Huang Huafen applied some mud bricks that had fallen from the wall to 1.2 mu of land, resulting in a yield of more than 100 jin of rice compared to previous years.

	However, no matter how rotten the houses were or how fertile the mud bricks were, the farmers here generally did not have the means to repair them or the ability to utilize them in the past.

	In mid-January of this year, the 15 primary cooperatives in Shicao Township merged, and two mutual aid teams joined, forming an advanced cooperative with 691 member households; all but 6 households in the township joined the cooperative. They formulated a plan to increase production by 133% in 1956 compared to 1955. To increase production, they needed enough fertilizer. Where could they find fertilizer? They thought of the old house mud. They decided to use the cooperative's labor to build houses for the members; the old house mud that was dismantled would belong to the cooperative. They calculated that building a house, from dismantling it to rebuilding it, would take 13 workdays; each house could yield 60,000 jin of mud fertilizer. This would benefit both the members and the cooperative.

	After all, the advanced cooperative had great strength, and they did what they said they would. They adjusted the labor force of the entire cooperative, gathering all 39 masons and 3 carpenters in the township to be specifically responsible for building houses. They decided to replace the 250 oldest and most dilapidated houses first, completing the work before the spring plowing. It is estimated that building these 250 houses would increase mud fertilizer by 180,000 dan, averaging 5,000 jin per mu. Combined with other local and miscellaneous fertilizers, they would basically not need to buy commercial fertilizers this year.

	The houses in Shicao Township were originally distributed very irrationally, with nearly 700 households divided into 20 small villages. This not only wasted land but also made collective activities very inconvenient. When planning to build new houses, they planned to adjust and merge the 20 small villages into 8 villages, based on the cultivation areas and production teams divided by the advanced cooperative. This would also increase a large amount of cultivated land area for the cooperative.

	Because the cooperative was building houses for its own members, it was very different from hiring workers to do it in the past. They not only paid attention to building the houses sturdily but also strived to save money in all aspects, using the usable materials from the old houses, saving the members a great deal of expense. Female member Lin Fengying, with a family of 4, had 5 rooms built for her by the cooperative. She didn't have to spend another penny except for buying 8 yuan of lime and iron nails. She happily told everyone, "I've wanted to build a house for decades. Now that I've joined the advanced cooperative, I've been liberated, and my house has been liberated too!"

    房子和肥料
    吴尔祥
    广东省电白县石曹乡农业生产合作社转变为高级社以后，制定了一个修建房屋的规划。他们将要在3年以内，使全乡农民都住上新房子。
    石曹乡的房屋都是用一块一块的泥砖垒起来的，一般都有100多年的历史了，有的已经经历了200多年的风雨。泥做的土块本来就不大结实，又经过多年的风吹雨蚀，大部分都已经破烂不堪。有些房屋的墙壁已经裂开了一尺多宽，刮风下雨，就沙沙响，泥土直往下掉。
    这种泥砖，因为经过长期的烟熏和风化，含有丰富的肥分。农民黄华芬去年把墙上掉下来的一些泥砖，施在一亩二分地里，结果比往年多收了100多斤稻谷。
    可是，不管房屋怎么烂，这些泥砖又怎么肥，这里的农民过去一般地都没有力量去修它，也没有办法去利用它。
    今年1月中旬，石曹乡的15个初级社合并起来，又吸收了两个互助组参加，办成了一个有691户社员的高级社；全乡除6户以外都入社了。他们制定了1956年比1955年增产133％的计划。要增产，就得有足够的肥料。从哪里找肥料呢？他们想起了旧屋泥。他们决定用合作社的劳动力替社员修建房屋；拆下来的旧屋泥归社里所有。他们计算了一下，修建一间房屋，从拆掉再建起来，要13个工；每间房可以拆下6万斤的泥肥。这样做，对社员有利，对合作社也有利。
    高级社毕竟力量大，说做就做到了。他们把全社的劳动力调整了一下，把全乡的39个泥水工和3个木工都集中起来，专门负责修建房屋。他们决定把最老最烂的250间房屋先换掉，春耕前完成。估计修建这250间房，就可以增加泥肥18万担，平均每亩有5，000斤。再加上别的土杂肥，今年他们基本上可以不用买商品肥料了。
    石曹乡的房屋原来分布得很不合理，全乡近700户，分成了20个小村。这样不但浪费土地，而且集体活动很不方便。他们在规划修建新房屋的时候，根据高级社所划分的耕作区、生产队，计划把20个小村调整合并成8个村。这样，还可以给社里增加大量的耕地面积。
    因为是社里给自己社员修建房屋，就同过去雇工来修大不一样了。他们不但注意把房子修坚固，还从各方面力求节约，把旧房上可以用的材料都用回去，给社员节省下了很大一笔开支。女社员林凤英，一家4口人，合作社给她修建了5间房，她除了买8元钱的石灰和铁钉外，不用再花一个钱。她到处高兴地对人说：“我想修房子想了几十年了。现在入了高级社，人翻身了，房屋也翻身了！”
