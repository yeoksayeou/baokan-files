Report on Visits to India, Burma, and Pakistan
Song Qingling

The Prime Ministers and governments of India, Burma, and Pakistan successively invited me to visit their countries. I left the country on December 16th of last year and returned to Kunming on February 4th of this year. During these 50 days, I visited the capitals and some important cities of these three countries. I met with the heads of their governments and parliaments, women's groups, and leaders of other groups. At numerous receptions, banquets, and tea parties, I came into contact with people from all walks of life. While visiting their factories, farms, schools, hospitals, research institutes, botanical gardens, zoos, museums, social welfare organizations, and places of historical interest, I also gained a rough understanding of their economic, social, and cultural realities. During this visit, I was very pleased to have the opportunity to browse through the relics of ancient cultures in these three neighboring countries and to appreciate the rich and colorful beautiful scenery there. Particularly unforgettable, I personally experienced the enthusiasm of the people and governments of these three countries for our new country, their growing friendly relations with us, and their warm hopes for us. It is felt that this emotion has great power.
                  India
    I took off from Kunming around 8:30 in the morning on December 16th last year and landed at Calcutta airport at noon. After lunch, I continued flying. On the plane, I saw the "Amrita Bazar Patrika" of India and read an editorial on my visit to India. I arrived in New Delhi at 5 pm. This is the local time, which is 7:30 pm here. On the same day, after discussing with Prime Minister Nehru, I decided on the itinerary for visiting various parts of India. After visiting Delhi for a few days, I went southwest to Bombay on the Arabian coast. From Bombay, I traversed India eastward to Calcutta on the Bay of Bengal. Then, I went south along the Bay of Bengal to Madras, and nearby to Bangalore to attend the Eighth Annual Conference of Indian Social Welfare Workers. From there, I went to Aurangabad to visit the nearby Ellora Caves. From Aurangabad, I flew back to New Delhi and then left India to visit Burma.
    As you know, when I arrived in India, the Soviet leaders had not been gone long. Many Indian friends were still talking about the enthusiastic welcome they received. Vice President Radhakrishnan told me that the grand scene of 3 million people welcoming the Soviet leaders in Calcutta Square was rare even when Gandhi was alive.
    December 18th was a Sunday, and I attended a welcome meeting of Delhi citizens, which was held in the former palace of the Mughal dynasty. Because the walls of the palace are made of red sandstone, it is called the Red Fort. At that time, it was not completely dark, and the trees and buildings were full of colored lights. The crowd greeted their guests by sprinkling rose petals and rose dew. The mayor delivered a welcoming speech, I delivered a reply, and then Prime Minister Nehru gave a half-hour speech, stating the principles of peaceful coexistence and international friendship. In this speech, he announced that India would establish diplomatic relations with the Mongolian People's Republic.
    The next morning, I visited an international industrial exhibition. In the Indian pavilion, I saw the products of their state-owned enterprises, the products of Tata Corporation, and handmade textiles. The most eye-catching thing was the exhibition of India's Second Five-Year Plan. Compared with the First Five-Year Plan, the Second Five-Year Plan has essential differences. Industrial investment accounted for only 8.4% of the total investment in the First Five-Year Plan, while industrial investment accounts for 26% of the total investment in the Second Five-Year Plan, with emphasis on the development of heavy industry. The First Five-Year Plan focused on the development of private enterprises, while the Second Five-Year Plan focused on the development of state-owned enterprises. It is said that the drafter of the Second Five-Year Plan was Professor Mahalanobis, a famous statistician and dean of the Statistical Institute of Calcutta. The Second Five-Year Plan was formulated based on his draft plan after discussion and revision by the Planning Commission. In order to make the broad masses of people aware of the significance of the Five-Year Plan, the Indian government displayed the content of this construction plan at the industrial exhibition. This fully demonstrates the importance that Indian friends attach to their economic construction.
    People in the Indian government's Planning Commission expressed great interest and concern about the development of agricultural production cooperatives in our country. They know very well that if production does not increase, the national economy cannot develop. If the rate of increase in production cannot be higher than the rate of increase in population, it will be difficult to solve the food problem. Some Indian friends who are influenced by the "population theory" of imperialist scholars have always doubted whether there is a way to solve the economic problems caused by the rapid increase in population. Now, upon hearing that the average annual increase in our agricultural production can exceed the average annual increase in population, they are very excited. It is said that they are preparing to organize a delegation to visit our country to understand the secret of the organization and development of our agricultural cooperative movement.
    In recent years, India's international status has obviously improved, and its foreign relations have gradually expanded. Therefore, the Indian government and people in society attach great importance to the study of international relations and the training of diplomatic talents. More than 10 years ago, India established the "World Affairs Society," which has now organized a "Diplomatic Academy" under the jurisdiction of Delhi University. The "World Affairs Society" is actually an "International Relations Institute," and the newly established Diplomatic Academy is a specialized school for training Indian diplomatic talents. These two organizations are also in a grand building. I visited it when I was in New Delhi. Their books have been accumulated for more than 10 years. Each of their researchers has a research room. Mr. Panikkar, who used to be the ambassador to China and Egypt, is also working as a researcher. Mr. Panikkar happened to be there when I visited. From his conversation, one can also understand their enthusiasm for actively supporting this organization.
    The Indian Parliament is divided into the Council of States and the People's Assembly, both in a grand building. When I visited, Home Minister Pant was speaking on the issue of the provincial zoning committee. Until now, except for the new Andhra Pradesh, the administrative regions of India are still planned during the British rule. As early as the Indian national movement, the Indian people demanded the re-division of provincial boundaries. The Central Government organized a "Provincial Reorganization Commission" the year before last. After investigation and research, this committee published a report at the end of September last year, suggesting that the 28 states in the country be changed to 16 states. When I visited India, the parliament was hotly debating this issue. It is said that nearly 200 members of parliament will speak in the parliament.
    On the first day leaving New Delhi, I went to Agra to visit the Taj Mahal. This is the mausoleum of the queen of the Mughal Dynasty, all built of marble. Because of its grand scale and beautiful architecture, it is world-famous. After the visit, I went to Bhopal, a city with a population of 200,000 in Central India. There were many people welcoming at the airport, especially women. They shouted long live China-India, long live friendship. There were welcome slogans everywhere in Bhopal. Children, teenagers, and young people along the way were all shouting "Kaki" and "Kachi." Kaki means aunt, and Kachi means maternal aunt. This expression fully reflects the enthusiasm of the Indian people for the Chinese people. I went to visit the "Social Construction Work Station" 24 miles away from Bhopal. Here I saw many men, women, and children, and dozens of families, all residents of nearby villages. They gathered there for two weeks, learning crafts, discussing rural issues, and learning common sense about public health under the leadership of teachers and counselors. It is said that this kind of "Social Construction Work Station" is quite common in India.
    It took two and a half hours to fly from Bhopal to Bombay. In Bombay, I lived in the governor's residence. The residence is surrounded by the sea on three sides, and the scenery is beautiful. The sound of the tide on the beach every morning and evening triggered my thoughts. During the Tang Dynasty in our country, many Arabs sailed to China for business and had to pass through this bay. During the Tang and Song dynasties, commercial exchanges between Guangzhou, Quanzhou, and countries in the Arabian Gulf were very prosperous. And now India's foreign trade depends on imperialist ships. The reason why their trade with us cannot develop quickly is also due to the lack of maritime transportation. The monopoly of the imperialists in the shipping industry is indeed an obstacle to large-scale economic exchanges between our two countries.
    The time I stayed in each place was very short, so some groups held joint welcome meetings. In Bombay, 29 mass organizations with more than 500 representatives held such a meeting. The local India-China Friendship Association also held a welcome meeting in a club, with more than 200 people attending. In addition, there was a citizen welcome meeting held in a park by the sea.
    When I arrived in Calcutta, there were more than 10,000 people welcoming at the airport and along the way. I lived in the residence of the Governor of West Bengal, which was originally the residence of the British Governor-General of India. The construction of this residence began in 1798 and was not completed until 1825. The buildings and trees in the garden are very old. Gandhi's ashes are enshrined in the outer hall of the Governor's office. Respect for Gandhi is universal in India. Gandhi's thoughts have influenced all levels of society. Dr. Roy, the Chief Minister of West Bengal, who is over 70 years old, is very devout in his worship of Gandhi. He gets up at 4 o'clock every morning. Because he used to be a doctor, he still sees patients for free from 7 to 8 am every day, and works in the office from 8 am to 7:30 pm. He talked to me a lot about Gandhi's thoughts. He said that Gandhi's thoughts are India's neutralism, Gandhism is pacifism, and anti-war.
    In Calcutta, I attended the welcome meeting of the India-China Friendship Association and the joint welcome meeting of 24 groups. I had a conversation with the female members of the West Bengal Provincial Assembly and the leaders of social welfare work. I also visited the National Museum and Art Gallery, glimpsed the culture of Bengal, and visited the Botanical Garden in the suburbs. It takes 20 minutes by car from the city to the Botanical Garden. There were crowds welcoming along the way, shouting the slogan "Long live the brotherhood between India and China". In the Botanical Garden, I visited a herbarium. This herbarium has a history of more than 150 years. The specimens collected here now amount to more than 2.5 million pieces. I think this is a very valuable research resource for botanists.
    On December 28th, I flew from Calcutta along the Bay of Bengal through Visakhapatnam, India's deep-water port, to Madras. Vizag port is similar to our Qingdao and is a good place for shipbuilding. During World War II, India's Scindia Company wanted to build seagoing ships here, but it could not proceed due to the lack of large cranes. Now, with the active support of the Indian government, the shipbuilding industry here is about to start developing. The place where I lived in Madras was still the governor's residence. This is the largest governor's residence in India, more than 3 li long from north to south and more than 18 li long from east to west. There are many trees and more than 500 deer. The place is very quiet, but it is far from the provincial government office and the city center.
    There are many social welfare organizations in Madras. More than 20 social welfare groups held a joint welcome meeting on the lawn of the governor's residence. This was hosted by the wife of the Central Finance Minister Deshmukh. The minister's wife is the leader of the government's social welfare committee. The program at the welcome meeting included the Indian classical dance performed by Kamala Lakshman, a famous dancer from South India. The coordination of movements and music, and the expressions of the head, eyes, and gestures in this dance were all very outstanding. After the meeting, I had dinner with the governor and Ambassador Lai Jiawen and his wife, who had recently returned from Beijing.
    It took about an hour to fly from Madras to Bangalore. The altitude of the flight was seven or eight thousand feet. This is a plateau, the weather is very clear, and the famous Kolar gold mine area can be seen very clearly from the plane. Bangalore is in the eastern part of Mysore Province and is a famous resort. In recent years, industry has gradually developed. Here, I visited the famous Raman Institute of Physics and saw the various ores and diamonds collected in the institute for the study of optics. In the afternoon of the same day, I attended the Eighth Annual Conference of Indian Social Welfare Workers. In my speech at the conference, I introduced the welfare work for women and children in our country. The next morning, I flew from Bangalore to Aurangabad. From there, I took a car to see the Ellora Caves. These are two- and three-story temples, Buddha statues, birds, and animals carved from a stone mountain. Most of these stone carvings were carved during the Tang Dynasty in our country. This is a world-famous stone carving. The stone carvings here represent the religious art of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.
    On the same day, I returned to New Delhi from Aurangabad. Before flying to Rangoon on January 2nd this year, I said in my farewell speech on All India Radio in New Delhi: This time I saw the relics of ancient Indian culture, the scale of modern civilization, and the achievements of recent construction, which gave me a deep impression and made me firmly believe in the great future of friendly cooperation between China and India.
                  Burma
    When I visited Burma, I was also warmly welcomed. When the plane arrived at Rangoon Airport on the afternoon of January 2, there were more than 1,000 people waiting at the airport. However, because the weather was good that day and there was a tailwind, the plane arrived an hour earlier than scheduled. Therefore, so many people had not arrived yet. On the way from the airport to the city, I also saw many crowds walking towards the airport. The next morning, after paying respects at the tomb of General Aung San, I visited the Speaker of the House of Nationalities, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Prime Minister U Nu. Then I had lunch with Prime Minister U Nu. Speaker of the House of Nationalities, Sao Hkun Hkio, had been to Yunnan and Guangzhou before, and was particularly friendly to China. He is the former President of Burma and is from the Shan State in northern Burma. During the conversation, I learned that both he and his wife were willing to send their 10-year-old child to study in China in the future. That afternoon, I attended a citizen's welcome meeting held in Rangoon City Hall. The ceremony of the welcome meeting was very grand. More than 1,000 people attended. Then, there was a women's welcome meeting of more than 100 people, which was held by the lake in the suburbs. Everyone talked very cordially.
    January 4th is Burma's Independence Day. Early in the morning, everyone was preparing to participate in the ceremony. The viewing platform is in the center of Rangoon, facing east, facing the Shwedagon Pagoda and the Sule Pagoda. The teams passing in front of the viewing platform are all organized. After the ceremony, the crowds were strolling and singing on the streets and by the lake, very lively. It was even more lively in the evening. After World War II, Burma completely broke away from the British Commonwealth and became an independent republic. This is the happiest thing for the whole country. Therefore, they celebrated this day with particular enthusiasm. But the disaster brought to Burma by World War II was very serious. The destruction of Mandalay was even worse than that of Rangoon. The Ava Bridge across the Irrawaddy River near Mandalay has only recently been repaired. Hundreds of ships that were bombed and sunk in the river have not yet been salvaged. After that destruction, not only was the development of industry greatly hit, but also the export of rice was hindered. On the viewing platform, Burmese President Ba U said in his speech that Burma had signed barter trade agreements with the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, the Soviet Union, and Poland in the past year, and would sign similar agreements with other countries this year. This policy of expanding foreign trade will surely play an active role in Burma's economic recovery and construction.
    The Shwedagon Pagoda, which represents Burmese culture, stands tall in the city of Rangoon. The entire golden building is embedded in the blue sky. The shadow of the top of the pagoda is reflected on the nearby lake. The top of the pagoda is round and entirely covered with gold, emitting a strong light, and the scenery is very beautiful in both day and night. It is said that this pagoda contains eight hairs of the Buddha that two Burmese merchants brought back from India when Shakyamuni was alive. In the second half of the eighteenth century, King Ava added another layer of gold to the original pagoda. Later, emperors of all dynasties repeatedly added a layer of gold, and also built many large and small bronze bells. When I visited the Shwedagon Pagoda, I heard the sound of the bell as I walked up the steps, which was the sound of a large bronze bell weighing 16 tons in the northwest corner. This is a sacred bell in the eyes of the Burmese. It is said that during the Burmese-British War in 1824, the British wanted to transport this big bell to England as war booty. However, just as it was being transported to the ship, the bell unfortunately fell into the river. At that time, British engineers were unable to salvage it. The Burmese requested: If they could salvage it, let them put it back at the Shwedagon Pagoda. In this way, two years later, the big bell was moved to the Shwedagon Pagoda.
    The Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma organized a lecture meeting hosted by Prime Minister U Nu at Rangoon City Hall on January 6, with more than 1,300 people attending. I spoke to them about the relationship between anti-colonialism and safeguarding world peace, and stated the contribution of China-Burma friendship to world peace. In the afternoon of the same day, President Ba U held a garden party at the Presidential Palace, which was one of the programs to celebrate Burma's Independence Day. After the tea party, everyone sat down to watch the music and dance performances on the stage, including the performance of Kyi Kyi Htay, a famous Burmese film star and dancer who won the Music Academy Medal. Even more meaningful was "Unity is Strength" choreographed by the late Burmese famous dancer U Ba Sein. In this dance drama, the actors dress up as three groups of birds, parrots, pigeons, and quails. They fell into the net one after another. Because they can cooperate, they finally escaped from the net. This performance also shows the main trend of Burmese art.
    On January 11, I arrived in Mandalay, which is the city that best represents ancient Burmese culture. Mandalay was once the capital of Burma. Before that, Amarapura and Sagaing across the Irrawaddy River were also ancient capitals of Burma. In the afternoon of the same day, I traveled west from Mandalay, crossed the Ava Bridge, and visited these two places. Amarapura was a textile center in the Middle Ages. I visited a textile training school, which had 40 male and female students each. The looms were imported from Japan. Sagaing also has some handicraft industries such as the manufacture of silverware. It is famous for having many pagodas. Even so, the number of pagodas in Sagaing is far less than that in Bagan in the middle reaches of the Irrawaddy River. The original plan for visiting Burma was to return to Rangoon from Mandalay by boat, but later, in order to save time, I changed to a plane. Otherwise, going down the river would have given me the opportunity to visit the ancient relics of Bagan. From the third to the thirteenth century AD, it was the cultural center of Burma, until the end of the thirteenth century, Bagan was ravaged by Kublai Khan.
    In Mandalay, I visited the Polytechnic Institute established by the government half a year ago. This is a middle school with departments of mechanical engineering, chemistry, civil engineering, and electrical engineering. Students are exempt from tuition fees and can also receive a subsidy of 60 kyats per month. After graduation, they must serve the government for two years. Although there are only 85 students at present, the scale and equipment of the school can accommodate more than 400 students. This is also a manifestation of Burma's desire to develop industry.
    When the British imperialists abolished Burmese King Thibaw Min, the Burmese king's palace was turned into a fortress for the British army, and his palace was turned into a chapel for the garrison. During World War II, the Japanese imperialist army occupied this ancient palace of Mandalay again. When the Japanese army withdrew, the British air force bombed it to pieces, turning it into ruins, with only the city walls still standing. The address of this old palace is square, with an area of ​​more than 6,000 acres. There are red city walls around it. The reflection of the city walls is reflected on the water of the moat, and the scenery is very beautiful. I have been to the ruins of this ancient palace twice. Once, I attended the welcome meeting of the Mandalay Women's Federation. The All-Burma Women's Federation has 150,000 members, and there are more than 2,000 in Mandalay. The second time was to attend a lecture meeting organized by the municipal government in the southwest corner of the ruins. When I gave a speech, there were more than 1,000 people in the audience. Minister of Home Affairs Bo Khin Maung Gale and Minister of Cooperation Tekin Daqing were also present.
    After leaving Mandalay, I arrived in Taunggyi. This is the capital of Shan State in northern Burma, and it is also the highest place in Shan State, with an altitude of more than 4,000 feet. The road to Taunggyi is beautiful and very touching. The streets in Taunggyi are clean and all look like gardens, with herbs and flowering trees, many varieties, and complex colors. On one section of the street, the wild cherry blossoms are brightly colored and dense like clouds. There were many people lining up to welcome along the road, including Shan, Burmese, overseas Chinese, and Indian overseas Chinese. The government guesthouse is located below a cliff nearly 1,000 feet high. The cliff is also full of flowers and plants. At night, from the upstairs of the government guesthouse, I saw the electric light on top of a pagoda. This Yadana Mote Pagoda was built by Wu Kangdi, a famous Burmese monk.
    Most of the people I met in Taunggyi were Shan people. It is said that the Shan people have a population of about 2.2 million in Burma. They and the Dai people in western and southern Yunnan in our country are of the same ethnic group. There were originally 33 princes in Shan State, Burma, 6 in North Shan State and 27 in South Shan State. After Burma's independence, North Shan State was divided into Lashio City and 2 counties, and South Shan State was divided into Taunggyi and Kalaw and 3 counties. Outside Taunggyi City, there is Taunggyi County, including the original 16 princes. Outside Kalaw City, there is Kalaw County including the original 8 princes. In the Burmese constitution, South Shan State and North Shan State have been merged into one state, commonly known as Shan State, with a state government and state parliament. There is a Shan State Minister in the Burmese cabinet who is in charge of Shan State affairs. The current Foreign Minister Sao Khun Hkio is also the Governor and Shan State Minister, and his home is in Taunggyi. Taunggyi has an experimental farm established by the Shan State government, with many varieties of wheat, and there is a fruit canning cooperative factory nearby. I have visited them all.
    From Taunggyi by car, it was all downhill. The road twisted and turned down in the mountains, all the way to Pindaya, which is 1,500 feet lower than Taunggyi. This is also where a prince of Shan State lives, which has now been changed to a county seat. The car goes directly to the lake. This is the famous Inle Lake in northern Burma. The Burmese government specially invited me to visit. Soviet leaders Bulganin and Khrushchev had been here in early December last year. Before them, Yugoslav President Tito had also been here. I saw that there were many people welcoming by the lake, and there were more than one ethnic group. The Shan people here are in the minority, and most of them are Intha people living on the lake and Danu people living in the nearby mountains. There is floating soil on Inle Lake, which is formed by rotten plants. There are houses built on top of the floating soil. The Intha people live on these floating soils, forming villages. The Burmese word "In" means lake, and "Le" means four. There were originally 4 villages on the lake, so it is called Inle Lake. Now there are more than 30 villages on the lake.
    The scenery on the lake is indeed beautiful, and I would like to introduce it here. The lake surface is more than 20 li from north to south and about 45 li from east to west, surrounded by mountains. The water of the Bilo River passes through the valley, thus forming this large lake. After the Bilo River flows out of Inle Lake, it is called Loi Ko River and flows into the Salween River. You must know that the upper reaches of the Salween River is our Nu River in Yunnan, China. The wood produced in Burma is world-famous. The long wooden boats on the lake are made of this excellent wood. The boats are powered by motors and are very fast. After leaving the pier by the lake, it takes 18 minutes to skim through the flowers and plants growing on the water. After driving for another 10 minutes, you will arrive at a pavilion in the center of the lake. The scenery on the lake is very beautiful. Looking up, it looks like you are in a valley, and looking down, it looks like you are lying on an endless silk. Burmese friends arranged lunch in the pavilion in the center of the lake. Before the meal, everyone watched the boat race. During the competition, men and women each had a boat, and people stood in two rows on the boat. The method of rowing is very special, using legs to paddle. It is said that whenever foreign friends come here, local youths hold such boat races.
    A few days later, I visited Mawlamyine, the third largest city in Burma above the Gulf of Mottama. This commercial port traded earlier than Rangoon. The British occupied Mawlamyine for more than 20 years before going to Rangoon. Currently, most of the rice exported from Burma is from Rangoon, and most of the wood is from Mawlamyine. The Salween River is different from the Irrawaddy River. Its current is too rapid to be navigable, but a large amount of wood flows down the river. There are many types of wood, and a considerable amount of wood is sold to India every year to make sleepers and carriages. In Mawlamyine, I visited a sawmill, and they also used elephants to transport wood. In the afternoon of the same day, I flew back to Rangoon. The next day, I went west to Pakistan for a visit. Burma is a very beautiful place, and all ethnic groups in Burma are peace-loving. The original meaning of the name of the Burmese capital Rangoon is "the end of hatred and war".
                Pakistan
    When I arrived at Karachi Airport at 2:15 pm on January 24, local time. At this time, it was 3:15 pm in Dhaka, eastern Pakistan. I visited 3 major cities during this visit to Pakistan. In addition to the capital Karachi, there are also Lahore, the capital of West Pakistan Province in the north, and Dhaka, the capital of East Pakistan Province. Among these three major cities, Karachi has the shortest history, but the population has increased the fastest. Before World War II, Karachi had a population of only 400,000, but it has now increased to more than 1.2 million. Many of the newly built houses in the suburbs were built in the last 3 years. Most of these houses are white and located on the sandy soil of the Indus River Delta, which makes the radiation of sunlight appear particularly strong.
    The Indus River runs through the entire territory of West Pakistan Province from north to south, and the lower reaches are one of the earliest areas of ancient culture. According to the research results of archaeologists, we know that there was urban culture here as early as around 3,000 BC. Some cultural relics representing this culture are now displayed in the Karachi National Museum. On the fifth day of my arrival in Karachi, the mayor of Karachi held a ceremony on the lawn behind the National Museum and presented me with a golden key. This is a traditional etiquette in the Middle Ages, and giving the key to the city gate means friendship. On the stage, a passage from the Koran was recited first, and then the mayor delivered a welcome speech to me.
    I attended the Pakistan Constituent Assembly for nearly two hours. The agenda at that time was the debate on the draft constitution. I heard speeches with two different opinions and understood some of their constitutional issues. Pakistan is a new country established more than 8 years ago. In recent years, constitution-making has been their important issue. There are several points in this draft constitution that deserve our attention. First of all, according to this draft, Pakistan will become an independent and autonomous republic within the British Commonwealth, which will be the same as India's current status within the British Commonwealth. Secondly, Pakistan will become a federal country, with power shared between the central government and the provinces, and the two provinces will have autonomy. Third, Urdu in West Pakistan and Bengali in East Pakistan will simultaneously become the languages ​​of the government. In addition, in order to promote the development of their national economy, this draft constitution stipulates the establishment of a "National Finance Committee" with a term of 10 years, whose task is to propose a plan for the distribution of tax revenue between the central and provincial governments.
    I visited Lahore on January 27th and 28th. Here, I visited the Badshahi Islamic Mosque. The square here can accommodate more than 10,000 people for prayer. I also visited the Shalimar Garden built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. The garden covers an area of ​​240 acres. There are many trees in the garden, especially mangoes, and the scenery is elegant. I also visited a newly built women's medical college, with more than 400 students. There are several ethnic groups in West Pakistan Province. Ali Khan, the Minister of Minority Ethnic Areas of the Provincial Government, held a banquet at the Provincial Government Guesthouse on behalf of the Governor. At this banquet, I met other ministers of the West Pakistan Provincial Government and members of the Provincial Assembly. There are 300 provincial members here, 11 of whom are female.
    The day after returning to Karachi from Lahore, I flew to Dhaka, the capital of East Pakistan Province. The flight took six and a half hours without stopping in the middle. Sometimes, I flew above 7,500 feet. When the plane landed, I saw more than 500 welcoming crowds. At that time, I felt that the climate was hotter and more humid than in West Pakistan. Although Dhaka is not on the seaside, it receives hot winds from the Bay of Bengal, and the average annual rainfall is very high. There are many rivers, large and small, around Dhaka, and jute is widely planted. Ancient Dhaka was once a textile center. Here, I visited the Academy of Fine Arts run by the government and the private Bool Bool Academy of Music and Dance.
    At that time, Pakistani Governor General Mirza happened to be in Dhaka. At the 60-person banquet he held, I had the opportunity to talk with officials of the East Pakistan Provincial Government, members of the East Pakistan Provincial Assembly, and leaders from the business community. From these conversations, I realized the importance of jute to the entire East Pakistan Province. In the past, East Pakistan did not have a jute manufacturing industry. Now East Pakistan has 5,000 new-style jute looms. It is said that by the end of this year, the number of looms can be increased to 7,250. The worldwide consumption of jute was 10 million bales (400 pounds per bale) 8 years ago, but has recently increased to nearly 12 million bales. The raw materials required by the newly established hemp factories in Turkey, Egypt, Iraq, and Indonesia are all supplied by East Pakistan. The export of raw jute and the development of the jute manufacturing industry are very important to Pakistan.
    Before leaving Pakistan, Dhaka University awarded me an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. During the ceremony of awarding the degree, I emphasized the importance of historical science research in my speech. I said: Human progress is getting faster and faster. This is certainly due to the accumulation of culture, but it is also due to the continuous improvement of human understanding of history. Once the broad masses of people have this understanding, great power will be generated. History proves that all awakened people have overthrown the rule of colonialism and fought for the independence of their own country. Today, the broad masses of people are gradually realizing the threat of war and the disasters of war. Therefore, in recent years, the forces of peace and friendship have been gradually growing everywhere. However, people who go against the development of history will inevitably fail. As long as we understand this forward process of history, we will have a hundred times the courage to overcome all difficulties and move forward.
    What I said above is the process of my visit to India, Burma, and Pakistan this time. I think this visit is very meaningful. As the friendly relations between our three neighboring countries are increasing, my visit this time will have a little effect. Although India, Burma, and Pakistan differ in the degree of industrial development and also differ in the situation of import and export trade, these three countries equally demand the construction of their own national economies, the expansion of equal and mutually beneficial foreign trade, and the development of their own modern industries. Therefore, they all advocate peace and oppose war. This is consistent with the demands of the people of our country.

    印度缅甸巴基斯坦三国访问报告
    宋庆龄
    印度、缅甸、巴基斯坦三国的总理和政府先后邀我到他们那里去访问。我于去年12月16日出国，今年2月4日回到昆明。在这50天，我访问了这三个国家的首都和一些重要城市。我会见过他们政府和议会的负责人、妇女团体和其他团体的领袖们。在多次欢迎会、宴会、茶会上，我接触到他们的各界人士。在参观他们的工厂、农场、学校、医院、研究所、植物园、动物园、博物馆、社会福利机关、名胜古迹的时候，我也约略地了解了他们的经济、社会、文化的一些实际情况。在这次访问中，我非常之愉快地有机会浏览我们这三个邻国古代文化的遗迹，领略那里丰饶多采的绮丽风光。特别令人难忘的，我这次亲身体会到这三个国家的人民和政府对我们这个新的国家的热情，他们与我们之间日益发展着的友好关系，以及他们对于我们的热烈希望。令人感觉到这种情感存在着伟大的力量。
                  印　度
    去年12月16日早晨8点半的光景从昆明起飞，中午降落在加尔各答机场上，午饭后继续飞行。在飞机上我看到印度的甘露市场报，读到报上关于我访问印度的一篇社论。下午5时到达新德里。这是当地时间，就是我们这里的下午7点半。当天我和尼赫鲁总理商量以后，就决定了访问印度各地的日程。在德里参观几天以后，向西南到了阿拉伯海岸上的孟买。从孟买横贯印度向东到了孟加拉湾边上的加尔各答。然后沿着孟加拉湾向南到了马德拉斯，就近到班加罗尔去参加了印度社会福利工作者第八次年会。从那里去奥南格巴德参观了附近的阿罗拉石刻。从奥南格巴德飞回新德里，然后离印度去访问缅甸。
    诸位知道，在我到达印度的时候，苏联领袖离开印度还没有好久。许多印度朋友还在常常谈论欢迎苏联领袖的热烈情况。副总统拉德哈克里希南和我谈话的时候，就说，在加尔各答广场有300万人欢迎苏联领袖这样盛大的场面，这在甘地在世的时候，也很少见。
    12月18日是星期日，我出席了德里市民的欢迎会，这是在莫卧儿王朝故宫里举行的。因为王宫的城墙是用红砂石砌成的，所以称为红堡。当时天还没有完全黑，树木和建筑上满装着彩色灯光。群众撒着玫瑰花瓣，洒着玫瑰花露来迎接他们的客人。市长致欢迎词，我致答词，随后尼赫鲁总理演讲了半小时，申述了和平共处、国际友好。就在这次讲话中，他宣布印度将与蒙古人民共和国建立外交关系。
    第二天早晨参观了国际工业博览会。在印度馆里看到他们国营企业的出品、塔塔公司的出品、手工纺织的产品。最引人注意的是印度第二个五年计划的展览。第二个五年计划和第一个五年计划比较起来，具有本质上的差别。第一个五年计划工业投资只占总投资的8.4％，第二个五年计划的工业投资占到总投资的26％，并且着重重工业的发展。第一个五年计划着重私营企业的发展，第二个五年计划着重国营企业的发展。听说第二个五年计划的起草人是著名统计学家马哈南诺必斯教授，他是加尔各答的统计学院院长。第二个五年计划是根据他的计划初稿经过计划委员会讨论和修改而规定的。印度政府为着要使广大人民认识五年计划的意义，曾在工业博览会上陈列了这个建设计划的内容。这充分表现了印度朋友对于他们的经济建设的重视。
    印度政府计划委员会的人士对于我国农业生产合作社的发展，表示非常重大的兴趣和关怀。他们很清楚地知道如果生产不增加，国民经济就不可能有所发展。如果生产增加的速率不能高于人口增加的速率，那就很难解决粮食问题。一部分受帝国主义学者所说的“人口论”的影响的印度朋友们，一向怀疑是否有办法解决因人口迅速增加而发生的经济问题。现在听到我们平均每年农业生产的增加竟能超过平均每年人口的增加，他们感到非常兴奋。听说他们准备组织考察团来我国访问，想了解我们农业合作化运动的组织和发展的秘诀。
    近年来，印度的国际地位显然提高，对外关系也逐渐扩大，因此印度政府和社会人士对国际关系的研究和外交人材的培养，非常重视。10多年前，印度就成立了“世界问题学会”，这个学会现在已组织了“外交学院”，隶属于德里大学。“世界问题学会”实际是个“国际关系研究所”，而新成立的外交学院是培养印度的外交人材的专门学校。这两个机关也同在一座规模宏大的建筑里，我在新德里时曾去参观过。他们的图书已积累了有10多年。他们的研究员每人都有一间研究室。过去在中国、埃及当过大使的潘尼迦先生也在当一个研究员。我去参观的时候，潘尼迦先生恰巧在场。从他谈话中也可以了解他们对这个机关的积极赞助的热诚。
    印度国会分联邦院和人民院，同在一所规模宏大的建筑里。我去参观的时候，内政部长潘特正在对省区划分委员会问题进行发言。直到现在，除了一个新的安德拉省以外，印度的行政区都还是英人统治时代所规划的。早在印度的民族运动中，印度人民就要求重新划分省界。前年中央政府组织了“省区重划委员会”。这个委员会经过调查研究以后，在去年9月底发表了一个报告，建议把全国28邦改为16邦。当我访问印度的时候，议会正在热烈讨论这个问题。据说，将近有200位议员要在议会中发言。
    离开新德里的第一天，到亚格拉去参观泰吉·玛哈尔陵。这是莫卧儿王朝皇后的陵墓，全部用大理石筑成。因为它规模宏大，建筑美丽，所以是世界闻名的。参观后到印度中央省有居民20万的波保尔城市。在飞机场上欢迎的人很多，特别是妇女。他们高呼中印万岁、友谊万岁。波保尔城里到处有欢迎的标语。沿途小孩、儿童、少年都在喊“卡基”“迦纪”。卡基是姑妈的意思，迦纪是姨妈的意思。这种表示充分反映了印度人民对中国人民的热情。我曾到离波保尔城24里地方参观“社会建设工作站”。在这里我看到许多男女儿童和几十家人家，他们都是附近村庄的居民。他们集合在那里住了两个星期，在教师和辅导员的领导下学习手艺、讨论农村问题、学习公共卫生常识。听说，这种“社会建设工作站”在印度相当普遍。
    从波保尔飞行两时半到了孟买。在孟买住在省长的官邸。官邸三面临海，风景美丽。每天早晚海边的潮声触发了我的感想。我国唐朝的时候，许多阿拉伯人航海到中国来经商都要经过这个海湾。唐宋两代，广州、泉州和阿拉伯海湾一带的国家的商业来往，非常繁盛。而现在印度的对外贸易都要靠帝国主义的船舶。他们和我们的贸易往来之所以不能很快地发展，缺乏海上运输工具也是一个原因。帝国主义者在航业上的垄断实在是我们两国之间大规模经济交流的阻碍。
    我在每个地方停留的时间都很短促，因此各团体有的联合举行欢迎会。在孟买曾有29个群众团体500多名代表举行了这样的一个会。当地的印中友好协会在一个俱乐部里也举行了欢迎会，到会的有200多人。另外还有当地的市民欢迎会是在海边的一个公园里举行的。
    到加尔各答的时候飞机场和沿途欢迎的人在1万多人以上。我住在西孟加拉省长的官邸，这所官邸原是英国驻印度的总督府。这个官邸1798年就开始建筑，1825年才完成。建筑和庭园的树木都非常古老。在省长办公室的外厅，供奉着甘地的骨灰。对甘地的尊敬，在印度是普遍的。甘地的思想影响到社会各阶层。西孟加拉省的首席部长罗伊博士，年纪在70以上，对甘地的崇拜是很虔诚的。他每天早晨4时起身。因为他过去是医生，现在每天7时至8时给病人免费看病，从8时到下午7时半在办公室里工作。他对我谈了许多关于甘地的思想。他说甘地的思想，就是印度的中立主义，甘地主义就是和平主义，反战主义。
    在加尔各答曾出席印中友好协会的欢迎会和24个团体的联合欢迎会。我曾和西孟加拉省议会的女议员、社会福利工作的领袖接谈。又曾参观了国立博物院和画廊，窥见了孟加拉的文化，还到近郊参观了植物园。从市区到植物园汽车要走20分钟。沿途有群众欢迎，高呼印中兄弟万岁的口号。在植物园中参观了一个花草标本室。这个标本室已有150多年的历史。这里所搜集的标本现在已多至250余万件。我想这是植物学家很宝贵的研究资料。
    12月28日，从加尔各答沿着孟加拉海湾经过印度的深水港口维扎格巴塔，飞抵马德拉斯。维扎港和我们的青岛差不多，是个很好的造船的地方。在第二次世界大战时期，印度的新迪亚公司要想在这里建造航海船舶，但因为缺乏大型起重机，所以无法进行。现在在印度政府的积极支持下，这里的造船业将要开始发展。在马德拉斯我住的地方还是省长的官邸。这是印度各省省长官邸面积最大的一个，南北长在3里以上，东西长在18里以上。树木很多，还有500多头鹿。地方很幽静，但离省府的办公处和市中心较远。
    在马德拉斯有好些社会福利机关。有20几个社会福利的团体，在省长官邸的草地上举行了联合欢迎会。这是由中央财政部长德希穆克的夫人所主持的。这位部长夫人是政府的社会福利委员会的领导人。在欢迎会上的节目有南印度著名舞蹈家卡马拉·加克希曼表演的印度古典舞。这种舞蹈，动作和音乐的配合，头、目、手势的表情，都非常出色。会后曾和省长以及新近从北京回去的赖嘉文大使夫妇共进晚餐。
    从马德拉斯飞行一个钟头的光景到达班加罗尔。飞行的高度在七八千尺。这里是个高原，天气非常晴朗，从飞机上能够非常之清楚地看见著名的科拉金矿区。班加罗尔在卖索尔省的东部，是个有名的休养地方，近年来工业也逐渐发达。我在这里参观了著名的拉曼物理学研究所，看到所内为研究光学而搜集的各种矿石和金钢钻。当天下午出席了印度社会福利工作者第八次年会。会上我在演讲中曾介绍了我国妇女儿童的福利工作。第二天早晨从班加罗尔飞抵奥南格巴德。从那里乘汽车去看阿罗拉石刻。这是从一座石山雕出来的两层和三层楼的庙宇、佛像、飞禽、走兽。这些石刻大多是在我国唐朝的时代雕刻的。这是世界闻名的石刻。这里的石刻代表印度教、佛教、耆那教的宗教艺术。
    当天，从奥南格巴德回到新德里。在今年1月2日飞行仰光以前，我曾在新德里全印广播电台上的告别词里说：我这次看到印度古代文化的遗迹，近代文明的规模和最近建设的成绩，给我一种深刻的印象，使我坚定地相信中印两国间友好合作的伟大前途。
                  缅　甸
    我到缅甸访问的时候，同样受到热烈的欢迎。1月2日下午飞机到仰光机场的时候，有1，000多人在机场等候。但因那天天气好又是顺风，飞机比预定的时间早到了一小时光景。因此还有那样多的人没有赶到。在从飞机场到市区的途中，还看见很多群众向机场走去。第二天早上，拜谒昂山将军陵墓以后，去访问民族院议长、代表院议长和吴努总理。随后在吴努总理那里进午餐。民族院议长萧恢塔从前到过云南和广州，对中国特别亲切。他是前任的缅甸总统，是缅北掸邦人。在谈话中，知道他们夫妇两位都愿意把他们10岁的孩子将来送到中国留学。就在那天下午，我出席在仰光市政厅举行的市民欢迎会。欢迎会的仪式十分隆重。到会的在1，000人以上。接着，又是100多人的妇女欢迎会，这是在郊外湖边举行的。大家交谈得非常亲切。
    1月4日是缅甸的独立纪念日。清早大家就准备参加观礼。观礼台在仰光的市中心，东向，面对小金塔和大金塔。在观礼台面前走过的队伍都是有组织的。礼毕以后，群众在街头、在湖边，游览的、歌唱的，非常热闹。到了晚上，更加热烈。二次大战后，缅甸完全脱离了英联邦，成为一个独立的共和国。这是他们举国上下最高兴的一件事。所以他们对于这一天的庆祝，特别热烈。但是二次大战给缅甸带来的灾难是非常严重的。曼德勒城市的破坏比仰光还要厉害。在曼德勒附近横跨伊洛瓦底江的阿瓦铁桥最近才修复起来。江上被炸沉的数百船舶，至今还没有打捞起来。经过那次破坏，不但工业的发展受到重大的打击，就是大米的出口也受到阻碍。在观礼台上缅甸总统巴宇博士在讲话中说道，缅甸在过去一年中曾和德意志民主共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、苏联、波兰订立了换货贸易的协定，在本年内还要和其他国家订立同样的协定。这种扩大对外贸易的政策对于缅甸经济的恢复和建设，必然会起积极的作用。
    代表缅甸文化的大金塔，高耸在仰光的市内。整个金黄的建筑嵌入蔚蓝的天空。塔顶的影子倒射在附近的湖面上。塔顶是圆形，全部包着黄金，发出强烈的光芒，不论在白昼月夜，景色都非常美丽。据说，这个塔藏有释迦牟尼在世时两位缅甸商人从印度带回八根佛的头发。在十八世纪下半期，阿瓦王把原有的宝塔又加上一层黄金。后来，历代的皇帝都屡次加上一层黄金，并且还造了许多大小的铜钟。我到大金塔参观的时候，走上台阶就听到钟声，这就是西北角上一个16吨重的大铜钟所发出的钟声。这是缅甸人认为神圣的大钟。据说，在1824年缅英战争时期，英国人要把这个大钟运到英国，作为战利品。可是，正在运到船上的时候，不巧这个钟落在江里。当时英国的工程师无法把它打捞起来。缅甸人要求：如果他们可以打捞起来的话，让他们把它还放在大金塔那里去。这样，两年后，这个大钟就被搬到大金塔去。
    缅甸反法西斯人民自由同盟，1月6日在仰光市政厅组织了一次由吴努总理主持的演讲会，到会的有1，300多人。我为他们讲了反殖民主义和保卫世界和平的关系，并且申述了中缅友好关系对于世界和平的贡献。当天下午总统巴宇博士在总统府举行游园会，这是庆祝缅甸独立纪念的节目之一。茶话以后大家坐下看台上音乐舞蹈的表演，其中有获得音乐学院奖章的缅甸电影明星著名的舞蹈家其其泰的表演。更有意义的是已故缅甸著名舞蹈家吴波赛所编的“团结就是力量”。在这个舞剧里，演员扮装着三群鸟类，鹦鹉、鸽子、鹌鹑。他们先后陷入罗网，因为能够合作，终于逃出了罗网。这次表演也表现出缅甸艺术的主要趋势。
    1月11日到了曼德勒，这是最能代表缅甸古代文化的城市。曼德勒曾经是缅甸的首都。在那以前，伊洛瓦底江对岸的阿马纳巴纳和实皆也先后是缅甸的古都。当天下午从曼德勒西行，过阿瓦铁桥，到这两个地方去游览。阿马纳巴纳是中古时代的一个纺织中心。我去参观了一个纺织训练所，内有男女生各40人，织机是从日本输入的。实皆也还有些制造银器之类的手工业。这里以佛塔很多著名，虽然如此，实皆的佛塔的数量还远不及伊洛瓦底江中游蒲甘那里的多。原来在缅甸访问的计划是要从曼德勒乘船回到仰光的，后来因为节省时间，所以改乘飞机。否则顺江而下就有机会游览蒲甘的古迹。从公元第三到十三世纪它是缅甸的文化中心，直到十三世纪的末年，蒲甘才被忽必烈所蹂躏。
    在曼德勒曾经参观过半年前政府所成立的理工学院。这是一个中级学校，有机械、化学、土木、电机等科。学生免交学费，每月还可领60缅币的津贴。毕业后必须为政府服务两年。目前虽只有学生85名，但学校的规模和设备可容纳学生400余名。这也是缅甸要求发展工业的一种表现。
    当英帝国主义者废除缅王思宝的时候，缅王的宫殿被改成英军的一个堡垒，他的宝殿被改成驻军的礼拜堂。在二次大战时期，日本帝国主义的军队又占领了这个曼德勒的故宫。日军撤退的时候，英国的空军把它炸得精光，变成一片瓦砾，只有城墙还依旧存在。这个故宫的地址是四方形的，面积有6，000余亩。四周有红色的城墙。城河的水面上映着城墙的倒影，景色十分美丽。我曾两次到过这个故宫的废墟。一次是出席曼德勒妇女联合会的欢迎会。全缅妇联有15万会员，在曼德勒的有2，000余人。第二次是出席市政府在这废墟的西南角上所组织的演讲会。当我演讲的时候，听众有1，000余人。内政部长波庆貌格礼、合作部部长德钦达庆也在座。
    离开曼德勒以后就到了东枝。这是缅甸北部掸邦的首都，也是掸邦地势最高的地方，海拔4，000余尺。走向东枝的路上，山林幽美，非常动人。东枝市区的街道清洁，全部类似花园，有草本，也有花树，种类很多，颜色也很复杂。有一段街的两旁，野樱花花色鲜艳，密似云彩。道旁排队欢迎的民众很多，有掸人、缅人、华侨、印侨。政府招待所是在一个近1，000尺高的峭壁下面。峭壁上下也尽是花草。夜间从政府招待所的楼上看到一个佛塔顶上的电灯。这个亚达莫佛塔是缅甸著名的大和尚吴康第所修建的。
    在东枝见到的大多数人都是掸人，据说掸族在缅甸约有220万人口。他们和我国云南西部和南部的傣族都是一个民族。缅甸的掸邦原有33个王公，6个在北掸邦，27个在南掸邦。缅甸独立以后，北掸邦就分为腊戌市和2个县，南掸邦分为东枝、高乐2市和3个县。东枝市以外有东枝县，包括原有的16个王公。高乐市以外有高乐县包括原有的8个王公。在缅甸的宪法上，南掸邦和北掸邦已并为一邦，通称为掸邦，设有邦政府及邦议会。在缅甸的内阁中有管理掸邦事务的掸邦部长。现任外交部长藻昆卓兼任着邦长和掸邦部长，他家就在东枝。东枝有掸邦政府所建立的实验农场，小麦的品种很多，附近有水果罐头合作社的工场。我都曾去参观过。
    从东枝乘汽车，一路是下坡，公路在山中盘旋而下，一直到比东枝低1，500尺的阳辉。这也是掸邦一个王公所住的地方，现在已经改为县治。汽车直达湖边。这是缅北著名的茵莱湖。缅甸政府特地邀请我去游览。苏联领袖布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫在去年12月初曾经来过。在他们之前，南斯拉夫总统铁托也曾来过。我看见在湖边欢迎的人很多，而且不止一种民族。这里的居民掸族却占少数，多数还是住在湖上的茵莱族，和住在附近山上的当度族。茵莱湖上有浮土，这是腐烂的植物所结成的。浮土上面有房屋建筑。茵莱族在这些浮土上面居住，形成村落。缅文的“茵”是湖的意思，“莱”是四个的意思。湖上原来有4个村庄，所以叫做茵莱湖。现在湖上已经有30多村了。
    湖上风景确实幽美，我想在这里介绍一下。湖面从南到北有20余里，从东到西有45里左右，四周都是山。碧罗江的江水穿过山谷因此形成这个大湖。碧罗江流出茵莱湖以后，就叫做洛爱科江，流入萨尔温江。诸位想必知道萨尔温江的上游就是我国云南的怒江。缅甸所出的木材是世界闻名的。湖上长形的木船是用这种优良的木材造成的。船是使用马达发动的，速度很快。从湖边码头开出后，18分钟内，一直在水上生长的花草中掠过。再驶行10分钟，到了一个湖心亭。湖上景色很美。抬头看好像是在一个山谷里一样，往下看好像躺在无边无际的丝绸上一样。缅甸朋友们在湖心亭上安排了午餐。餐前大家看赛船。比赛的时候，男女各自一船，人们在船上站成两行。划船的方法很特别，是用腿划桨的。听说，每逢国外友人来到这里，当地的青年就举行这样的赛船。
    过了几天，曾到玛打万湾上面的缅甸第三个大城进行访问。这就是有11万人口的毛淡棉。这个商港的贸易早于仰光。英人占据了毛淡棉20余年以后，才到仰光。缅甸目前大宗的大米是从仰光出口的，大多数木材是从毛淡棉出口的。萨尔温江与伊洛瓦底江不同，它水流太急，不能通航，但是有大量的木材顺流而下。木材的种类很多，每年销到印度去做枕木和车箱的木材为数不少。在毛淡棉我参观了一个锯木厂，他们还用大象拖运木材。当天下午飞回仰光。第二天就向西到巴基斯坦进行访问。缅甸是个很美丽的地方，缅甸各民族都是爱好和平的民族。缅甸首都仰光这个名称，原来的意思就是“仇视和战争的结束”。
                巴基斯坦
    1月24日下午到达喀喇蚩飞机场的时候是当地时间两点一刻。在这个时候，正是巴基斯坦东部达卡的三点一刻。这次访问巴基斯坦曾经到过3个大城。除喀喇蚩首都外，还有北面的西巴省省会拉合尔和东巴省省会达卡。这3个大城市中以喀喇蚩的历史为最短，但人口的增加却最快。二次大战以前，喀喇蚩人口只有40万，现在已增至120万以上。城郊新建的房屋很多是最近3年内建筑的。这些房屋绝大多数是白色，位于印度河三角洲的沙土上，这使阳光的幅射显得特别强烈。
    印度河自北而南横贯着西巴省全境，下游是古代文化最早的一个区域。根据考古学家研究的结果，我们知道远在公元前3，000年左右，这里就有城市文化。代表这种文化的一些文物，现在陈列在喀喇蚩国立博物馆。在我到了喀喇蚩的第五天，喀喇蚩市长在这国立博物馆后面的草地上举行了一个仪式，赠给我一个金钥匙。这是中古时代传统的礼节，授给城门上的钥匙就是表示友好的意思。在台上，首先朗诵可兰经的一段经文，随后市长对我致欢迎词。
    我曾在巴基斯坦的制宪议会里旁听了差不多两个钟头。当时的议程是关于宪法草案的辩论。我听到两种不同意见的发言，了解了他们宪法上的一些问题。巴基斯坦是8年多以前成立的一个新的国家。这几年来，制宪一直是他们的重要问题。这个宪法草案中有几点是值得我们注意的。首先是，根据这个草案巴基斯坦将在英联邦内成为独立自主的共和国，将和现在印度在英联邦内的地位一样。再则，巴基斯坦将成为联邦制的国家，中央与各省实行分权，两省各有自治权。第三，西巴的乌尔都语和东巴的孟加拉语将同时成为政府的用语。此外，因为要促进他们国民经济的发展，这个宪法草案规定要成立一个“国家财政委员会”，任期10年，任务是提出中央和省政府税收分配的方案。
    1月27、28日两天我在拉合尔进行访问。在这里我参观过巴夏希伊斯兰教礼拜寺。这里的广场可容1万多人做祈祷。又参观了莫卧儿王朝夏吉汗所建筑的夏礼马园。这园的面积有240亩。园内树木很多，特别是芒果，景色幽雅。还参观了新建的一个女子医学院，学生在400人以上。西巴省内有好几个民族。省政府的少数民族地区部长阿里·汗曾代表省长在省府招待所举行宴会。我在这个宴会上遇见西巴省府的其他部长和省议会的议员。这里有300位省议员，其中有11位是女议员。
    从拉合尔回到喀喇蚩以后的第二天就乘飞机到东巴的省会达卡。飞行六个半小时，中途没有停。有时，飞到7，500尺以上。飞机降落时，我看到有500多欢迎的群众。当时感觉到气候比西巴要热些，并且潮湿些。达卡虽然不在海边上，但因受到孟加拉海湾来的热风，平均每年的雨量很高。达卡周围大小河流很多，黄麻种植得很普遍。古代达卡曾经是一个纺织业的中心。我在这里曾参观过政府所办的美术学院和私立的波波尔音乐舞蹈学院。
    那时，巴基斯坦总督米尔扎将军恰巧也在达卡。在他所举行的60人的宴会上，我曾有机会和东巴省府的官员、东巴省议员、和工商界领袖们谈话。从这些谈话中体会到黄麻对整个东巴省的重要。过去东巴没有制麻的工业。现在东巴已有5，000架新式的黄麻织机。据说今年年底这个织机数可增加到7，250架。全世界黄麻消费量在8年前是1，000万包（每包400磅），最近已增加到差不多1，200万包。在土耳其、埃及、伊拉克、印度尼西亚新设立的麻厂所需要的原料，都靠东巴来供给。原麻的出口和制麻工业的发展，对巴基斯坦都是非常重要的。
    在离开巴基斯坦以前，达卡大学曾授我名誉法学博士的学位，举行授学位的典礼时，我在讲话中曾经着重提出历史科学研究的重要。我说：人类的进步是愈来愈快的，这固然是由于文化的积累，可是也由于人类对于历史的认识程度不断的提高。广大人民一旦有了这种认识，就发生伟大的力量。历史证明凡是觉悟了的人民都曾推翻了殖民主义的统治，争取了自己国家的独立。今天广大人民逐渐认识到战争的威胁和战争的灾害。因此这几年来，和平友好的力量到处在逐渐壮大。可是违背历史发展的人们，必定是会失败的。我们只要认识了历史的这种前进过程，我们就有百倍的勇气克服一切困难，向前迈进。
    前面所说的是我这次访问印度、缅甸、巴基斯坦的经过。这一次的访问我觉得是很有意义的。当着我们这三个邻国对我们的友好关系正在增进的时候，我这一次访问，是会发生一点点作用的。印度、缅甸和巴基斯坦在工业发展的程度上虽然各有差别，在进出口贸易的情况上也有些不同，但这三个国家同样地要求建设他们自己的国民经济，要求扩大平等互利的对外贸易，要求发展自己的现代工业，因此他们都主张和平，反对战争。这同我国人民的要求是一致的。在这样共同的基础上，我们之间的友好合作，不但是可能的，而且是必要的。
