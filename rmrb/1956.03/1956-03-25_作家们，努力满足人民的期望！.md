    The Second Council Meeting (Enlarged) of the Chinese Writers Association has concluded. The meeting focused on discussing the issue of developing and prospering creation, which is very necessary. With the vigorous development of our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation, the people's need for socialist culture and art is also growing. They demand that the ever-changing face of our country, the new relationships between people, and the new attitudes of people towards labor can be truly and vividly reflected in literary and artistic works. They demand more and better works to be their companions and mentors in life. However, despite the emergence of some good works in recent years, the backward state of our literary cause is undeniable. We have rarely seen truly exciting literary creations with high ideological content and beautiful artistic form.
    The meeting conducted frank and well-intentioned criticism and self-criticism, examined various reasons hindering the progress of literary and artistic endeavors, and the writers unanimously expressed their determination to change the state of literature lagging behind life with their greatest efforts. The meeting affirmed that the ideological criticism in the literary and art circles in the past two years was of great significance. In particular, the destruction of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and the timely prevention of sectarian cliques in literary and art circles have cleared the way for the progress of literary and artistic undertakings. In the future, literary and art circles should continue to deeply criticize various bourgeois idealist thoughts in literature and art and anti-people, anti-realist tendencies, further consolidate the principle of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and intellectuals in literature and art, and strengthen the unity among literary and art workers.
    Regarding the work of cultivating new forces and expanding the literary ranks, the meeting determined some necessary steps, which should be gradually implemented in the future to implement the spirit of the meeting. There were serious shortcomings in this aspect of work in the past, and the phenomenon of ignoring or discriminating against young authors should continue to be opposed in the future. The ongoing National Youth Literary Creators Conference will undoubtedly play an important role in cultivating young writers and promoting the cause of literary creation. However, the love for young authors must be combined with strict demands on them. Attention should be paid to a bad tendency that has already emerged, that is, a small number of young literary creators have developed a sense of pride and complacency. They do not understand the important responsibilities that writers bear to society and the people, nor do they understand that literary creation is an arduous undertaking that requires tremendous labor and must be performed conscientiously and diligently to complete the task. On the contrary, they become complacent and self-satisfied with a little achievement, boasting everywhere, no longer focusing on work, and eagerly pursuing fame and status. What contributes to this tendency is that some newspaper and magazine editorial departments are only interested in promoting some young authors; some authors have only published one or two better works, and newspaper and magazine editors come to interview them, take photos, write long interview reports, or ask the authors to publish some creative experience; some publishing institutions blindly solicit manuscripts, as long as a certain author becomes famous, they immediately solicit manuscripts, sign contracts, and pay advances, while the work is not even in sight. This vulgar style will only make some young authors with insufficient cultivation lose their heads, and at the same time encourage shoddy work in literary creation, which is obviously harmful to young literary workers and has actually produced bad results.
    The Party and the people attach great importance to writers. Many of our accomplished writers who are loyal to the people's cause regard this importance as a great honor, as well as an encouragement and spur to their work. They enthusiastically expressed that they would better assume their responsibilities. Whether older or younger literary creators should prevent pride, complacency is a trap on the road to progress.
    The meeting also discussed improving the ideological and moral cultivation of writers and strengthening creative labor. The decadent morals and idle bourgeois style were seriously criticized.
    In our era, the social role of literature has grown immeasurably. Literature should not only reflect the truth of this great era, but also help new things in real life to win. Literature should truthfully and vividly express the glorious image of advanced people among the people, while exposing and criticizing all darkness and backward phenomena in life. Therefore, writers should not be bystanders in the struggle of reality, they must actively participate in life and go deep into the struggle. They must always live with the people and maintain close, flesh-and-blood ties with those who are actively struggling for socialist transformation and socialist construction. And in order to correctly understand reality, writers must strive to master Marxism-Leninism, the weapon for scientifically understanding the world, and at the same time strive to acquire extensive knowledge. Only by deeply studying reality on the basis of creatively mastering Marxism-Leninism can we prevent bad tendencies such as formalism and naturalism in creation.
    After this meeting, the Chinese Writers Association formulated a work outline for the next twelve years. The task of the Writers Association is to do everything possible to promote the prosperity and development of literature of all nationalities in our country. Literary workers across the country should strive to achieve the various tasks in this outline.
    It should also be pointed out that the development of literature is by no means something that can be shouldered solely by writers or the Writers Association. It must be helped by society. Particularly important is the Party's leadership over literary and artistic work. Party organizations in various places should provide guidance on political ideology to local writers' organizations and other creative units, and provide appropriate assistance on creative conditions. Appropriate personnel with political experience and organizational skills should be sent to work in these groups, and at the same time, writers who originally held administrative positions should be able to free up some time for creation as much as possible. Local governments and people's organizations should also reasonably arrange writers' social activities to ensure their creative time.
    The Party and the state care for the work of writers in every possible way. The great and rich reality provides writers with endless creative materials. Our writers should make a hundred times more efforts to improve the ideological and artistic nature of our literature, create works worthy of our country and era, and meet the expectations and demands of the people!

### 作家们，努力满足人民的期望！

    作家们，努力满足人民的期望！
    中国作家协会第二次理事会会议（扩大）已经结束。会议着重地讨论了发展和繁荣创作的问题，这是十分必要的。随着我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的蓬勃发展，人民对社会主义文化艺术的需要也日益增长。他们要求我们的日新月异的国家面貌、人与人之间的新的关系、人们对于劳动的新的态度，能够真实地生动地反映在文艺作品中，他们要求更多更优秀的作品来做他们的生活的伴侣和良师。但是，尽管近几年来，已经产生了一些好作品，我们的文学事业的落后状态是无可讳言的，我们还很少看到真正激动人心的、具有高度思想性和优美艺术形式的文学创作。
    会议开展了坦率的、善意的批评和自我批评，检查了阻碍文艺事业前进的各种原因，作家们一致表示决心以最大的努力来改变文学落后于生活的状态。会议肯定了两年来文艺界的思想批判是有重大意义的。特别是胡风反革命集团的摧毁和文艺界的宗派性小集团的及时制止，为文艺事业的进展扫清了道路。今后，文艺界应该继续深入批判文艺上的各种资产阶级唯心主义思想和反人民、反现实主义的倾向，进一步地巩固文艺为工农群众和知识分子服务的原则，加强文艺工作者之间的团结。
    在培养新生力量、扩大文学队伍的工作方面，会议确定了一些应有的步骤，今后应逐步实施，贯彻会议的精神。过去这一方面的工作是有严重缺点的，今后应该继续反对忽视或歧视青年作者的现象。目前正在举行的全国青年文学创作者会议，对于培植青年作家，推进文学创作事业，无疑地将会发生重要的作用。但是，对于青年作者的爱护必须与对于他们的严格要求相结合。应该注意目前已经显露出来的一种不良倾向，那就是少数青年文学创作者已经滋长一种骄傲自满的情绪。他们不了解作家对于社会和人民所担负的重大职责，也不了解文学创作是一种需要付出巨大劳动的艰苦事业，必须兢兢业业，刻苦努力，才能完成任务。相反地，稍有成就，就自满自足，到处吹嘘，不再安心工作，热心追求名位。助长这种倾向的是有些报刊编辑部对一些青年作者一味捧场；有些作者才发表一两篇较好的作品，报刊编者就来访问、拍照，大写访问记，或者要求作者发表什么创作经验；有些出版机构盲目拉稿，只要某某作者一经成名，就马上约稿，签订合同，预付稿费，而作品却连影子都还没有。这种庸俗作风只会使有些修养不足的青年作者冲昏头脑，同时鼓励文学创作上的粗制滥造，对于青年文学工作者显然是有害的，实际上，已经产生不良的效果。
    党和人民对作家是十分重视的。我们的许多有成就的忠实于人民事业的作家把这种重视当作莫大的光荣，也当作对自己工作的鼓励和鞭策。他们热忱地表示要更好地担负起自己的责任来。无论年长的或是年青的文学创作家都应该防止骄傲，骄傲自满是前进的道路上的陷阱。
    会议在提高作家的思想道德修养，加强创作劳动方面，也进行了讨论。道德堕落和游手好闲的资产阶级作风受到了严肃的指摘。
    在我们的时代，文学的社会作用是无比地增长了。文学不但要反映这个伟大时代的真实，而且要帮助现实生活中的新的东西获得胜利。文学应当真实地、生动地表现人民中的先进人物的光辉形象，同时揭露和鞭挞生活中的一切黑暗和落后现象。因此，作家不应该是现实斗争的旁观者，他们必须积极地干与生活，深入到斗争中去。他们必须经常和人民生活在一起，同那些积极为社会主义改造和社会主义建设而斗争的人们保持密切的，血肉相关的联系。而为了能够正确地了解现实，作家又必须努力掌握马克思列宁主义这一科学地认识世界的武器，同时努力获得广博的知识。只有在创造性地掌握马克思列宁主义的基础上深入地研究现实，才能够防止创作上的公式主义和自然主义等等不良的倾向。
    经过这次会议，中国作家协会制定了今后十二年内的工作纲要。作家协会的任务就是尽一切力量促进我国各民族文学的繁荣和发展。全国文学工作者应该为实现这个纲要中的各项任务而奋斗。
    还应该指出，发展文学事业决不是仅仅依靠作家或者作家协会所能担负起来的。它必须得到社会的帮助。特别重要的是党对于文艺工作的领导。各地党的组织应该对当地作家团体和其他创作单位在政治思想上加以指导，在创作条件上加以妥善的协助。应当派遣适当的有政治经验和组织能力的工作人员到这些团体中去工作，同时，尽可能地使原来担任行政工作的作家能够腾出一定的时间来进行创作。各地政府和人民团体还应当合理安排作家的社会活动，保证他们的创作时间。
    党和国家无微不至地关怀着作家的工作。伟大的丰富的现实为作家提供了无穷无尽的创作材料。我们的文学家们应该百倍地努力，提高我们文学的思想性和艺术性，创造出无愧于我们的国家和时代的作品，来满足人民的期望和要求！
