Improving Agricultural Production Techniques

    Production Experts to Low-Yield Areas
    Having production experts from high-yield agricultural areas form technical guidance groups to help farmers in low-yield areas improve their techniques is an important method for Henan Province to implement technical reforms in leading agricultural production this year. This method will be promoted in provinces, special districts, and counties.
    Currently, the cotton technical guidance groups organized by the Henan Provincial Department of Agriculture in western and northern Henan have begun to go to various counties in southern Henan. The flue-cured tobacco technical guidance groups organized in Xuchang and other counties, as well as the peanut, tussah silk, and corn technical guidance groups organized in other regions, will also depart soon. These agricultural technical guidance groups comprise a total of 510 people. They will be assigned to various agricultural production cooperatives and, through the cooperative's production activities, provide systematic technical instruction from beginning to end.
    "Elderly Farmers' Idea Contribution Meeting"
    In Triangular Township, Yuzhong County, Gansu Province, the 45th "Elderly Farmers' Idea Contribution Meeting" was held on March 20th. A farmer with experience in potato cultivation introduced at the meeting his experience of hybridizing the improved variety "Deep Eye Socket" potato with local potato varieties, which resulted in a yield increase of one-fold per mu compared to the past. This experience was praised by the young male and female farmers who attended the meeting.
    Triangular Township achieved full socialist agricultural collectivization at the end of last year. Beginning in January of this year, the township has invited experienced elderly farmers to hold "Elderly Farmers' Idea Contribution Meetings" at every stage of formulating production plans, the fertilizer accumulation campaign, water conservancy construction, and spring plowing and sowing. In the previous 44 meetings, elderly farmers introduced more than 20 yield-increasing experiences they had accumulated over many years. In late January, the township's Communist Party branch, based on more than 20 fertilizer accumulation methods proposed by the elderly farmers, launched a "Fertilizer Accumulation Campaign Month" throughout the township, increasing the amount of fertilizer applied per mu this year by more than double compared to last year.
    Technical Instruction Week Before Spring Sowing
    The plan formulated by Shanxi Province to improve spring plowing and sowing techniques has been jointly notified by the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture, the Shanxi Provincial Democratic Women's Federation, and the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League to be implemented in various regions. The notice requires all regions to carry out a province-wide technical instruction week before sowing. Agricultural and water conservancy departments at all levels, state-owned farms, agricultural technology extension stations, and the Shanxi Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences and other units should directly instruct 100,000 agricultural production cooperative technicians and production team leaders, and then use these people as the backbone to widely disseminate the information, so that by April 10th, one million people can understand, remember accurately, explain clearly, and do correctly the techniques specified in the plan.
    The notice requires that all relevant leading departments should make plans in advance, and women and youth should play a leading role in this technical instruction week.
    Promoting Early Rice Maturation
    Xinhua News Agency: One million jin of rice seeds in Jiangjin Special District, Sichuan Province, have been treated with the "water-restricted germination" method. After sowing, the period from emergence to harvest can be shortened by about seven days.
    For a long time, farmers in Jiangjin Special District have found it difficult to advance the maturation period of rice. In the spring of 1954, Soviet expert Buniak came to the Qinggang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Bishan County of this special district. He learned that the local improved rice varieties had a late maturation period, so he introduced the Soviet "water-restricted germination" seed treatment method to the cooperative. According to this method, the cooperative first loaded the local high-quality rice variety "Mawei Nian" into bamboo baskets and exposed it to the sun for four to five days, and then spread it out in a non-ventilated room, keeping it constantly at 20% moisture. Seeds treated in this way for about seven days had the advantages of rapid emergence, rapid tillering, and early maturation after sowing. In 1955, state-owned farms in various counties of Jiangjin Special District adopted this method and still obtained the same results.
    This year, the two million mu of double-cropping rice newly promoted in Jiangjin Special District mostly uses local improved varieties. In order to overcome the disadvantage of these varieties having a late maturation period, 300,000 farmer technicians throughout the special district have learned the "water-restricted germination" method and have carried out widespread demonstrations and instruction among the masses of farmers. The special district's agricultural department has also cooperated in printing and distributing more than 24,000 copies of booklets introducing "water-restricted germination" technology to agricultural cooperatives in various regions.

    改进农业生产技术
    生产能手去低产区
    由农业丰产区的生产能手组成技术辅导团帮助低产区农民改进技术，是河南省今年领导农业生产实行技术改革的重要方法。省、专区、县都要推行这个方法。
    目前河南省农业厅在豫西、豫北组织的棉花技术辅导团，已经开始到豫南各县去；在许昌等县组织的烤烟技术辅导团和在其他地区组织的花生、柞蚕、玉米等技术辅导团，也都将在最近出发。这些农业技术辅导团共510人。他们将被分派到各个农业生产合作社内，通过社里的生产活动，从头至尾进行有系统的技术传授。
    “老年农民献策会”
    甘肃省榆中县三角城乡，在三月二十日举行了第四十五次“老年农民献策会”。一个种植马铃薯有经验的农民，在会上介绍了他用良种“深眼窝”马铃薯和土种马铃薯杂交使每亩较前增产一倍的经验。这个经验，受到了参加会议的男女青年农民们的称赞。
    三角城乡在去年年底实现了全社会主义的农业合作化。从今年一月开始，这个乡在制定生产计划、积肥运动、兴修水利和春耕播种等各个阶段上，都邀请乡里有经验的老农举行“老年农民献策会”。在以前的四十四次会议上，老年农民们共介绍了他们多年积累下来的二十多项增产经验。一月下旬，这个乡的中共支部，根据老年农民们提出的二十多种积肥方法，发动全乡农民开展了“积肥运动月”，使这个乡今年每亩地的施肥量比去年增加两倍以上。
    春播前的技术传授周
    山西省制定的改进春耕播种技术的计划，已经由山西省农业厅、山西省民主妇女联合会和青年团山西省委员会联合通知各地贯彻执行。通知要求各地在播种前开展一个全省范围的技术传授周。各级农业水利部门、国营农场、农业技术推广站和山西省农业科学研究所等单位要直接向十万个农业生产合作社技术员和生产队队长等进行传授，然后以这些人作为骨干广泛开展传播，到四月十日前，使一百万人能把计划中规定的技术听懂、记准、说清、作对。
    通知要求各有关领导部门应在事前作好规划，妇女和青年在这次技术传授周中要起到带头作用。
    促进水稻提早成熟
    四川省江津专区已经有一百万斤稻种用“限水萌芽”方法处理。播种后，从出苗到收割可提前七天左右。
    长久以来，江津专区农民为提早水稻成熟期感到困难。1954年春，苏联专家布尼亚克来到了这个专区的璧山县青杠农业生产合作社。他了解到当地良种水稻成熟期较晚，便向社里介绍了苏联“限水萌芽”种子处理法。依照这个办法，社里把本地优良稻种“马尾粘”先装在斗筐内曝晒四、五天，然后摊开放在不通风的屋内，使经常保持20％ 的水分。这样经过七天左右处理的种子播种后，具有出苗快、分蘖快、成熟早的优点。1955年江津专区各县国营农场采用这一办法，仍旧获得同样的结果。
    今年江津专区新推广的二百万亩双季稻，大部采用本地良种。为了克服这些品种成熟期较晚的缺点，全专区三十万农民技术员都学习了“限水萌芽”的方法，并且在农民群众中作了广泛的示范传授。专区农业部门配合印发了二万四千多册介绍“限水萌芽”技术的小册子，送到各地农业合作社。（新华社）
