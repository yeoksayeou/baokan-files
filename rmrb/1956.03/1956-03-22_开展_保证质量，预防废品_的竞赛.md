Launching a "Guarantee Quality, Prevent Defective Products" Competition
    Guo Xuezhou
    The technical inspection departments of four factories in Shanghai, namely, the State-owned Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory, the State-owned Shanghai No. 2 Textile Machinery Factory, the State-owned Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory, and the State-owned Shanghai Tool Factory, recently proposed launching a socialist competition of "Guarantee Quality, Prevent Defective Products" in all machinery factories in Shanghai.
    The proposal states: Do a good job in all technical inspection work from the entry of materials into the factory to the exit of products from the factory to ensure that the products meet the prescribed standards; do a good job in prevention work such as first-piece inspection, cyclical inspection, and defective product analysis to cooperate with the production workshops to reduce the defective product rate and ensure that products meet national quality indicators; carry out metrological verification work to ensure the uniformity of measurement units, so as to further ensure product quality; collect and analyze user opinions, organize visiting groups to visit users on a regular basis to continuously improve product quality; implement the responsibility system, learn and promote advanced experience, and jointly improve the professional and technical level of technical inspectors, so as to improve work efficiency, reduce incorrect and missed inspections, and achieve timely inspections to cooperate with workshops to complete production tasks; actively carry out quality publicity and education work so that all employees establish a correct quality perspective.
    In recent years, the technical inspection work of various machinery factories in Shanghai has made great progress. Many factories have learned and promoted various advanced inspection experiences in accordance with the characteristics of the production type. After the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory implemented regional cyclical inspections and strengthened defective product analysis, the defective product rate in the workshops was significantly reduced. For example, the large parts workshop failed to meet the quality indicators for several consecutive months from May to October last year. The large parts inspection station analyzed the reasons for the low quality of workshop products, mainly due to the wrong dimensions during marking and the wrong drill sleeves used in drilling machines. Starting from October, the inspection personnel of the large parts workshop focused on these two types of work for inspection, and by November, the quality indicators were met. Only due to a marking inspector's timely discovery of marking errors, the working hours for preventing defective products in November were 710 hours, and in December, it reached 1,216 hours.
    However, some technical inspectors believe that technical inspection work is prone to conflicts with workers, workshop leaders, and related departments, and even leads to opposition, feeling that they are "punching bags," and therefore are not at ease in their work. The emergence of these ideas is of course related to the ideology of some workers, workshops, departments, and even enterprise leaders who value quantity over quality. However, it is also inseparable from the fact that some inspectors have low professional skills, unrealistic quality control, or are careless, making incorrect and missed inspections. Generally speaking, in recent years, under the leadership of the Party, the awareness of the broad masses of employees has greatly improved. Especially recently, improving quality has become their conscious demand. This has created favorable conditions for technical inspection work. Can technical inspectors both strictly ensure quality and avoid conflicts with workers, workshops, and departments? According to existing facts and experience, it is entirely possible. Since the State-owned Shanghai No. 2 Textile Machinery Factory promoted the three-inspection system, the first-piece inspection system, the statistical inspection method, etc., and strengthened mutual assistance and cooperation between production workers and technical inspectors, significant results have been achieved in preventing defective products. For example, Li Keshun, a lathe operator in the metalworking workshop, used to be fined and given demerits for having many defective products and felt very distressed. Since the implementation of statistical inspection, due to the mutual cooperation between the technical inspection personnel and him, the number of defective products has gradually decreased, and in the fourth quarter of last year, defective products were eliminated. He is very grateful to the technical inspection personnel for their help. The Shanghai Machine Tool Factory continuously improved product quality and improved the relationship between production workers and technical inspection personnel by having inspectors and production workers sign quality contracts (liaison contracts) and promoting advanced experience in technical inspection work. Chen Zhaofan, a production worker in the hydraulic workshop, used to argue with Wang Pin, a technical inspector, about the quality of products. After signing the contract, they cooperated with each other and strengthened clinical inspections. Since February last year, Chen Zhaofan has completed the quality indicators on a monthly basis, and his relationship with the inspector has also improved. Therefore, the problem does not lie in the technical inspection work itself, but in how technical inspectors can continuously improve their professional skills, better cooperate with production workers, and cooperate with workshops to complete production tasks. The proposal for this "Guarantee Quality, Prevent Defective Products" socialist competition was formulated based on this positive spirit.
    In the past, in the labor competitions carried out in machinery factories, technical inspection personnel were not deeply mobilized and organized to actively participate. Therefore, some machinery factories caused production disconnection, disrupted work plans, and even affected the completion of tasks due to poor technical inspection work. Now, the inspection departments of twelve factories, including Shanghai Boiler Factory, Huatong Switch Factory, and China Textile Machinery Factory, have formulated guarantee conditions in response to the proposal. It can be predicted that in the socialist competition, technical inspection personnel will learn from each other, learn from each other's strengths, and make greater and better achievements in ensuring quality and preventing defective products.

    开展“保证质量，预防废品”的竞赛
    郭学宙
    国营上海汽轮机厂、国营上海第二纺织机械厂、国营上海柴油机厂、国营上海工具厂等四个厂的技术检查科，最近倡议在上海全市机械工厂中开展“保证质量，预防废品”的社会主义竞赛的倡议。
    倡议书中提出：做好从材料进厂到产品出厂的各项技术检查工作，以保证出厂产品符合规定标准；做好首件检查、循环检查和废品分析等预防工作，以配合生产车间降低废品率，使产品达到国家的质量指标；开展计量检定工作，保证量值单位的统一，以进一步保证产品质量；收集和分析用户意见，组织访问小组，按期访问用户，以便不断改进产品质量；贯彻执行责任制度，学习和推广先进经验，共同提高技术检验人员的业务水平和技术水平，以达到提高工作效率，减少错检漏检，并且做到及时检查，配合车间完成生产任务；积极开展质量宣传教育工作，使全体职工树立正确的质量观点。
    几年来，上海各机械工厂的技术检查工作有很大的进步。不少厂已经按照生产类型的特点，学习和推广了各种先进的检验经验。上海机床厂自推行了区域循环检查，加强废品分析以后，车间的废品率有了显著的降低。如大件车间去年五月至十月份连续几个月没完成质量指标，大件检查站分析了车间产品质量低劣的原因，主要是由于划线的时候看错尺寸和钻床用错了钻模。从十月份开始，大件车间的检验人员就重点抓住这两个工种进行检查，到十一月份就达到了质量指标。单是由于一个检查划线的检查员及时发现了划线错误，预防废品的工时在十一月就有710小时，十二月份达到1，216小时。
    但是，有些技术检查人员认为：技术检查工作容易同工人、车间领导人员以及有关的科室发生矛盾，甚至造成对立，觉得自己是“受气筒”，因此不大安心工作。这些想法的产生固然同部分工人、车间、科室以至企业领导人员重量不重质的思想有关，但是，这同有些检验人员业务水平过低，控制质量不切实际，或者粗枝大叶，错检、漏检也是分不开的。一般说，几年来，在党的领导下，广大职工群众的觉悟有了很大的提高，特别在最近，提高质量已经成为他们自觉的要求。这给技术检查工作创造了有利条件。技术检查人员能不能做到既严格保证质量，又不跟工人、车间以及科室发生矛盾呢？根据已经有的事实和经验证明，完全是可能的。国营上海第二纺织机械厂自从推广了三检制、首件检查制、统计检查办法等，加强了生产工人同技术检查员的互助协作以后，对预防废品收到了显著效果。例如金工车间车工李克顺以往由于废品多，曾挨过罚款、记过等各种行政处分，感到很苦闷。自从推行统计检查以后，由于技术检查人员和他相互协作，废品逐渐下降，去年第四季度已经消灭了废品。他非常感激技术检验人员对他的帮助。上海机床厂通过检查员和生产工人订立质量合同（联系合同）；推广技术检查工作的先进经验，因而不断地提高了产品质量，同时也改善了生产工人同技术检查人员的关系。液压车间生产工人陈兆蕃跟技术检查员王品，以前为了检验产品质量，时常争吵，订了合同以后，相互协作，加强了临床检验，自去年二月份到现在，陈兆蕃按月完成了质量指标，同检查员的关系也好了。因此，问题不在于技术检查工作本身，而在于技术检验人员如何不断提高业务水平，更好地同生产工人共同互助协作，配合车间完成生产任务。这次“保证质量、预防废品”的社会主义竞赛的倡议书，就是根据这种积极精神拟订出来的。
    过去机械工厂在开展劳动竞赛中，没有深入发动和组织技术检验人员积极参加，因此有些机械工厂由于技术检查工作做得不好而造成了生产上的脱节，打乱了作业计划，甚至影响任务的完成。现在，上海锅炉厂、华通开关厂、中国纺织机械厂等十二个厂的检查科已订出了响应倡议的保证条件。可以预料，技术检查人员在社会主义竞赛中，相互学习，取长补短，对保证质量、预防废品，将作出更大更好的成绩来。
