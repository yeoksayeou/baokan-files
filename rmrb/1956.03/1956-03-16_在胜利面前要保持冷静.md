Maintain Calmness in the Face of Victory
Wu Erxiang

In the rural areas of Guangdong Province, inspired by socialist enthusiasm, tens of thousands of peasants are working diligently, regardless of whether it is sunny or rainy. Farmers in the Pearl River Delta are already soaking in the river to dig up river mud for fertilizer before dawn; on the arid land of the Jianjiang Plain, tens of thousands of new wells are appearing every day. Millions of peasants are using their own hands to build a happy socialist home.

The masses are already doing things that the leadership has not thought of; some things were only mentioned briefly, but the masses are doing even better than the leaders imagined. Seeing the great deeds of the masses, some comrades were surprised. After being surprised, instead of trying to make their leadership work catch up with the demands of the masses, they drew a wrong conclusion from this: Now they can sit back and relax. In their view, the masses can now do everything themselves, and there is no need to carry out specific organizational work. They sit high in their offices, making plans and issuing orders, without asking whether the plans they make are feasible, or how the plans are being implemented below, or whether there are any difficulties in the implementation. In Xiagang and Yunbu and other villages in Chao'an County, the staff proposed: "Dry seeding to cultivate strong seedlings" should be implemented this year. This was originally a good idea. However, no one helped the masses solve many technical problems. The masses understood "dry seeding" to mean "no irrigation," so the seeds that were sown did not germinate for more than ten days. However, the staff were still complacent about the reports from below about how many mu of "dry seeding" had been completed!

Many facts show that the socialist enthusiasm of the masses can only be transformed into massive mass action under the leadership of the Party, through specific organizational work. If a bureaucratic attitude is adopted, and one does not know how to cherish, guide, and promote it, the already emerging enthusiasm of the masses will be damaged and neglected. The Eighth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Chaoyang County assigned the task of increasing production to Xianmei Township this year: the yield of rice per mu should be increased from 1,017 jin to 1,300 jin, and the 1,700 mu of paddy fields in the township should increase grain production by more than 480,000 jin. This target may not be too high; but, unfortunately, the District Committee only assigned the target and then did not care about it anymore. The township staff were shocked when they saw this target. They calculated and calculated, but could not meet this requirement no matter what. If they didn't admit it, they were afraid of being labeled with the hats of "right-leaning" and "conservative." They had to put something together by force! As a result, they came up with "dipping seedling roots in fertilizer, increasing production by 40 jin per mu, and plowing and soaking seeds half a month earlier, which can increase production by another 35 jin" and other "production increase measures" that had no real and reliable basis. Obviously, the peasants are not unwilling to produce more grain, but there are many difficult problems that they cannot solve themselves, not to mention the obstacles of conservative thinking! If the plan cannot be turned into a conscious action of the masses, then what practical significance does it have? Unfortunately, such empty plans are not uncommon. Among the 143 agricultural cooperatives in Huizhai District, Jieyang County, 84 cooperatives only have production increase plans without concrete measures. In some areas, the production increase targets have been raised, but the production increase measures have not changed at all.

Because some leading departments are satisfied with having made production plans, and are reveling in the achievements and figures reported from below, the phenomenon of blindly pursuing quantity regardless of quality and engaging in deception has already appeared in many areas. The Party branch of Daping Township, Jieyang County, reported to the District Committee: "The winter-sown wheat is growing very well, there are no pests, the grass has been removed, and a lot of fertilizer has been accumulated." The District Committee felt relieved when it received such a report. However, the actual situation is: out of the 515 mu of winter-sown wheat in the township, 100 mu are overgrown with weeds, 100 mu are infested with pests, more than a dozen mu of wheat seedlings are about to wither, and only 2% of the original plan for fertilizer accumulation has been completed. The staff of Datang Township, Lianjiang County, asked the masses to accumulate 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu in two days. This is simply impossible, but they insisted that the masses do it. The masses had no choice but to dig mud from this field and pile it on another field, and even move the soil from the hillside to the field to make up the number, turning fertile fields into barren fields. The recently built river embankment in Geqiao Village, Lian County, is filled with firewood, dry grass, and sand inside the embankment, which the masses describe as "stuffed tofu." Some of the newly built river embankments in some areas have already collapsed, and the newly dug wells have already collapsed. May I ask, what is the purpose of such fertilizer accumulation, embankment repair, and well digging? Is it just to satisfy the requirements of some staff members for numbers? Then, it is necessary to ask these staff members to calculate how much labor, time, and materials the masses have lost because of this? It is also necessary to ask them to answer: What is the reason for wasting manpower and money in this way?

We are now in a high tide of socialist revolution, and there are many favorable conditions; however, we must also see that there are difficulties. Those comrades who have become a little "carried away" by victory should calm down a bit, sit less above and indulge in self-admiration, and hurry to the masses to do some specific and meticulous work. The spring plowing season is coming, and time waits for no one.

### 在胜利面前要保持冷静

    在胜利面前要保持冷静
    吴尔祥
    在广东省的农村中，成千成万的农民群众，在社会主义的热情鼓舞下，不分晴天或下雨，都在进行紧张的劳动。珠江三角洲上的农民，天还没有亮就已经泡到河里去挖河泥做肥料；在鉴江平原干旱的土地上，每天都出现成万个新的水井。千百万农民正在用自己的双手，来建设幸福的社会主义家园。
    领导方面没有想到的事情，群众已经在做了；有的事情只是提了一下，群众做的却比领导人员想的还要好。看到群众的壮举，有些同志吃惊了。他们在吃惊以后，并没有设法使自己的领导工作赶上群众的要求，而是从这里得出了一个错误的结论：现在可以高枕无忧了。在他们看来，现在群众自己什么都会做了，可以不必进行具体的组织工作了。他们高高在上地坐在办公室里定计划，发号令，不问他们所定的计划是否可行，也不问下面怎样实现这些计划，在执行当中是不是有困难。在潮安县下张、云步等几个乡，工作人员提出：今年要实行“旱播育壮秧”。这本来是一个好主意。但是，有许多技术问题没有人去帮助群众解决。群众把“旱播”理解为“不用灌水”，结果播下的种籽十几天还不发芽。可是，工作人员还为下面报来的已经完成多少亩“旱播”而洋洋自得呢！
    许多事实说明，群众的社会主义积极性，只有在党的领导下，通过具体的组织工作，才能变成巨大的群众性的行动。如果采取官僚主义的态度，不懂得如何去珍贵它、引导它、发扬它，就会使已经出现的群众积极性受到损害而冷落下去。中共潮阳县第八区委员会分配给仙美乡的今年增产任务是：水稻每亩产量要从1，017斤提高到1，300斤，全乡1，700亩水田，要增产稻谷48万多斤。这个指标可能不算太高；但是，可惜区委仅仅把指标分配下去，以后就不过问了。乡的工作人员看到这个指标，都吓了一跳。他们算来算去，无论如何也达不到这个要求。不认账吧，又怕给扣上“右倾”“保守”的帽子。只好硬凑吧！结果，订出了什么“蘸秧头肥，每亩增产40斤，提早半个月犁田、浸种，又可以增产35斤”等等并无切实可靠的根据的
  “增产措施”。显然，农民并不是不愿意增产更多的粮食，而是有许多困难问题，他们自己没有办法解决，何况也还有保守思想的阻碍呢！计划如果不能变成群众自觉的行动，那又有什么实际意义呢？可惜，这种空计划并不很少。揭阳县灰寨区143个农业合作社中，光有增产计划没有具体措施的就有84个社。有些地区增产指标提高了，而增产措施却一点也没有变。
    由于某些领导部门满足于已经订出生产计划，陶醉于下面报来的成绩和数字，目前在不少地区已经出现了盲目追求数量不顾质量和弄虚作假的现象。揭阳县大坪乡党支部向区委汇报说：“冬种小麦生长很好，没有虫害，草也除光了，还积了很多肥料。”区委得到这样的汇报，就以为大可放心了。但是，实际情况是：全乡515亩冬种小麦，有100亩野草丛生，100亩受虫害，有十几亩麦苗快要枯死了，积肥只完成原计划的2％。廉江县大塘乡的工作人员要群众在两天内每亩积肥1万斤。这是根本做不到的事情，但是他们硬要群众去做。群众只好从这块田里挖泥堆到另外一块田里去，甚至把山坡上的泥土搬到地里去凑数，把肥田弄成了瘦田。连县阁桥村最近新修的一条河堤，堤身里面塞满了柴枝、干草、沙泥，群众形容它是“酿豆腐”。有些地区新修的河堤已经崩了，新挖的水井已经塌了。试问，这样的积肥、修堤、挖井是为了什么？难道只是为了满足一下某些工作人员对数目字的要求吗？那末，有必要请这些工作人员去计算一下：群众为这损失了多少劳动力，损失了多少时间和物资？也有必要请他们答复：究竟有什么理由要这样劳民伤财？
    我们现在正处在社会主义的革命高潮中，有利条件是很多的；但是，也要看到不是没有困难的。那些已经被胜利弄得有些“飘飘然”的同志，应当冷静一点，少坐在上面自我陶醉，赶快到群众中间去做一些具体的细致的工作。春耕季节就要到来了，时间是不等人的。
