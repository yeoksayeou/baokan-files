To the All-Poland Committee of the National Front of the Polish People's Republic:

We were shocked to learn of the unfortunate passing of Comrade Bolesław Bierut, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and Chairman of the Presidium of the All-Poland Committee of the National Front of the Polish People's Republic, on March 12th. We express our deepest condolences to you, and through you, to the Polish people with utmost grief.

Comrade Bolesław Bierut's life of struggle was closely linked to the cause of world peace, democracy, and socialism. His passing has deprived the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, led by the Soviet Union, of an outstanding fighter.

Comrade Bolesław Bierut was a close friend of the Chinese people. He tirelessly dedicated himself to strengthening and consolidating the fraternal friendship and friendly cooperation between the people of China and Poland. His passing has caused boundless grief to the Chinese people. In these sorrowful days, the Chinese people will further consolidate their fraternal friendship with the Polish people, and will work together with the Polish people to continue to consolidate and develop the unity with the people of the Soviet Union and all People's Democratic countries, and advance the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism towards new victories.

Eternal glory to Comrade Bolesław Bierut!

        The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, March 14, 1956, in Beijing
