Run Employee Cafeterias Well
Cao Lifu

    Among the industrial and mining enterprises in Shanxi Province, there are many well-run cafeterias that are very popular with employees. However, there are still many employee cafeterias that are poorly run, seriously affecting the health and production of employees. For example, the Taiyuan Xishan Coal Mine, under the pretext of "enterprise-izing the cafeteria," increased the price of all kinds of food by 5% based on cost and sold it to employees, making a profit of more than 2,000 yuan per month. The cafeteria also does not supply employees with grain and cooking oil in accordance with state regulations, and the quality of the food is very low. Poor sanitation is also a common phenomenon in many cafeterias, with long periods without cleaning, unpleasant odors, and incomplete tableware. In some cafeterias, newly steamed buns have several black marks, and there are dirty things like grass roots, hair, and insects in the dishes. The Zihuyu pithead cafeteria of the Xishan Coal Mine has not been cleaned for several months, with dust all over the room, and the cooks do not wash their faces or cut their nails. The management of the cafeterias is chaotic, the system is not strict, and the phenomena of corruption and waste are also quite serious. The 9 administrators of the Xichromium Coking Plant cafeteria embezzled 1,062 jin of grain. In some cafeterias, workers have to queue 4 times for one meal (queue once to buy meal tickets, once to buy rice, once to buy vegetables, and once to return the bowl), and some employees are late for work due to eating, violating labor discipline.

    Poorly run cafeterias will hinder the health of employees and affect production. In the first 11 months of last year, the average number of people sick each month at the Yangquan No. 3 Mine accounted for 11.5% of the total number of employees, of which those who became ill due to poor food accounted for more than 18% of the total number of patients each month. Because the cafeteria is not well run and the prices are expensive, 80% of the single workers in the Taiyuan Xishan Coal Mine cook their own meals, making the dormitories messy, with coal cinders, oil cans, vinegar bottles, bowls, chopsticks, spoons and ladles everywhere, and the workers cannot get adequate rest.

    The main reason why employee cafeterias are not well run is that some enterprise leaders do not realize that caring for the lives of employees is the responsibility of the leadership, and they do not understand that only when employees eat well and rest well can they do their work well. Therefore, they either turn a blind eye to the affairs of employee cafeterias, or they want to make some money from the cafeterias to supplement the income of the enterprise. The enterprise's trade union organizations also rarely ask about the affairs of employee cafeterias, and do not conduct political education and health education for managers and cooks. Some cooks have the mistaken idea that "if you sing, you don't sing the female role, if you work, you don't cook," and have not been criticized. Therefore, to run employee cafeterias well, the Party organizations, administrations, and trade unions of enterprises must first truly care for the lives of employees, strengthen leadership over the work of the cafeterias, and do a good job in the work of the cafeterias in accordance with the principles of eating well, spending less money, maintaining good hygiene, and paying attention to nutrition.

### 办好职工食堂

    办好职工食堂
    曹力夫
    在山西省的工矿企业中，有不少办得好的很受职工欢迎的食堂。但是，现在也还有不少的职工食堂办得很不好，严重地影响了职工身体健康和生产。例如太原西山煤矿在“食堂企业化”的借口下，把各种饭菜价格一律按成本提高5％卖给职工，每月盈利2，000元以上。食堂也不按照国家规定供给职工粮食和食油，饭菜的质量很低。卫生工作作得不好，长时间不打扫，臭味难闻和饭具残缺不全，更是许多食堂的普遍现象。在一些食堂里，刚蒸好的馒头就有好几个黑印，菜里有草根、头发、虫子等脏东西。西山煤矿子虎峪坑口食堂，好几个月不打扫，灰土满屋，炊事员不洗脸，不剪指甲。食堂管理混乱，制度不严，贪污浪费现象也相当严重。西铬焦炭厂食堂9个管理员就贪污了1，062斤粮食。有些食堂，工人吃一顿饭要排4次队（买饭菜票、买饭、买菜、交碗各排一次），有些职工还因为吃饭误了上班，违犯劳动纪律。
    食堂办得不好，就会妨碍职工健康，影响生产。阳泉三矿去年1—11月，平均每月生病的人数占职工总数的11.5％，其中因为吃不好饭生病的，占每月病人总数的18％以上。因为食堂搞得不好，价格又贵，太原西山煤矿有80％的独身工人自己做饭，把宿舍弄得乱七八糟，到处是煤渣、油罐醋瓶、碗筷勺瓢，工人们也得不到适当的休息。
    职工食堂办得不好的主要原因，是有些企业的领导人员没认识到关心职工生活是领导的责任，不了解只有职工们吃得好，休息好，才能把活干好，所以，不是对职工食堂的事不闻不问，就是想从食堂中搞一点钱，补充企业的收入。企业的工会组织也很少过问职工食堂的事，对管理人员和炊事员不进行政治教育和卫生教育，有些炊事员存在着“唱戏不唱旦，干活不做饭”的错误思想，也没受到批判。因此，要办好职工食堂，首先要求企业的党组织、行政、工会，切实关心职工的生活，加强对食堂工作的领导，本着吃得好、花钱少、搞好卫生，注意营养的原则，搞好食堂工作。
