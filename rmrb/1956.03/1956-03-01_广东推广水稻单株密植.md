Guangdong Promotes Single-Seedling Dense Planting of Rice

Guangdong Province is actively promoting single-seedling dense planting of rice this year. According to statistics from 53 counties, 6.4 million mu will be used to promote single-seedling dense planting this year. Chenghai County, which once achieved a yield of 1,000 jin of grain per mu, will have single-seedling dense planting accounting for 70% of the total rice field area. In Chao'an, Puning, Zhongshan, and other counties, only more than 200 agricultural cooperatives tried planting last year, but this year more than 6,000 cooperatives are preparing for large-scale cultivation. In the Shantou area, more than 1,000 mu were used for trial planting of single-seedling dense planting last year, with yields generally increasing by 50 to 100 jin compared to small-clump dense planting. The Yunguang Agricultural Cooperative, which set a national record for high rice yield, cultivated 50 mu of single-seedling dense planting in the late rice crop last year, with an average yield of 972 jin per mu, an increase of 17% compared to general small-clump dense planting. Among them, 2 mu even achieved a high yield of 1,158 jin per mu. (Li Shaoqiu)

    广东推广水稻单株密植
    广东省今年积极推广水稻单株密植。据53个县的统计，今年要推广单株密植的将有640万亩。曾经获得粮食每亩千斤的澄海县，单株密植将占稻田总面积70％。潮安、普宁、中山等县去年只有200多个农业合作社试种，今年准备大面积栽培的就有6，000多个社了。汕头专区去年试种单株密植1，000多亩，普遍比小科密植增产50至100斤。创全国水稻丰产纪录的云光农业合作社，去年晚造栽培单株密植50亩，平均每亩收谷972斤，比一般小科密植增产17％，其中有2亩还获得每亩1，158斤的高额产量。（李少球）
