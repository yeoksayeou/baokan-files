Mobilizing Rural Women to Learn Agricultural Techniques
Deputy Director of the Research Office of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, Wang Zhao

With the development of agricultural collectivization and the agricultural production increase movement, a series of reforms have been carried out in agricultural production technology in recent years. Women have played a significant role in the technical reform process. Many women have learned agricultural production techniques such as seed selection, seed soaking, rational close planting, thinning, transplanting, replanting, variety improvement, cotton pruning, fertilizer accumulation, and pest and disease control. In some areas, women have even become the main force. For example, in Hebei Province, corn artificial pollination is now mostly done by women. In cash crop areas, women's participation in technical management is even more common. In Henan Province, women basically handle the technical management of cotton and tobacco in various regions.

In learning and promoting agricultural technology, many female technicians and production experts have emerged. According to statistics from Heilongjiang Province in 1954, there were 3,882 female technicians of various types. Agricultural production cooperatives in various regions have paid attention to training various female technicians. Some regions have even ensured that each cooperative and each production team has a female technician. Many regions have also paid attention to training women experts in driving horse-drawn farm implements and tractors.

Due to thousands of years of feudal constraints, rural women in our country are generally behind men in agricultural technology. Although this has gradually changed in the past few years since liberation, their technical level is still relatively low and cannot keep up with the needs of production development. On the one hand, some male cadres do not fully recognize the importance of women learning technology and have feudal conservative ideas, believing that "women are backward" and cannot learn well. They have not seriously created good conditions for women to learn technology. On the other hand, women themselves still have more or less feudal ideas and dependence, and women's federations in many places have not seriously studied and solved this problem. This has limited the improvement of women's technical level. At present, some agricultural production cooperatives implement contract quota management. Because female members have low technical skills, work slowly, and produce poor quality, they hinder the completion of the cooperative's production tasks and affect their enthusiasm for production.

Increasing agricultural production requires farmers to master agricultural production technology. Rural women account for half of the rural population, so at present, we should pay special attention to mobilizing and organizing women to learn various agricultural techniques that they are physically capable of, to meet the needs of agricultural production and further give play to women's active role in production.

To mobilize women to learn agricultural technology, it is necessary to educate male farmers, especially grassroots cadres, to make them recognize the importance of women learning technology. We must break the feudal ideas of some grassroots cadres and male farmers who discriminate against women and the conservative ideas of not wanting to pass on their skills to women. We must make them realize the significance of women learning technology for increasing production and promptly commend male farmers who have achieved success in teaching women technology. We must also educate women on the importance of learning technology, so that they realize that only by improving agricultural technology can they better participate in production, make greater contributions to socialist construction, and further improve their position in society and the family. Organizing women to learn agricultural production technology should be tailored to local conditions. In areas with field crops, women should be organized to learn general agricultural techniques, such as seed selection, thinning, weeding, harvesting, threshing, fertilizer accumulation, pest and disease control, the use of new farm tools, and corn artificial pollination. In cash crop areas, women should be organized to learn the technical management of cotton, tea, hemp, tobacco, and other crops. This technical management is not only labor-intensive, requiring care and patience, which is more suitable for women, but is also more suitable for women's physical strength. In mountainous areas, with the development of diverse economies such as fruit trees, forestry, and animal husbandry, women need to be organized to learn various techniques such as fruit tree management, beekeeping, silkworm rearing, pig raising, chicken raising, and animal husbandry. In urban suburbs, the main task is to organize women to learn vegetable production technology. In areas where labor is scarce, cultivation is rough, and land potential is great, great importance should be attached to women learning agricultural technology to unleash their labor potential. In short, women should be mobilized and organized to learn technology in various ways according to needs and possibilities to meet the requirements of agricultural production increase.

According to local experience, the following are some methods for organizing women to learn technology:

First, carry out mass mutual teaching and mutual learning. Call on farmers with skills to teach women to learn technology. Advocate men teaching women and mutual teaching and mutual learning to widely expand women's learning technology activities, so that women can generally master general farming techniques.

Second, train technical backbones to transmit technology, and use the backbones to drive women to learn technology at all levels. For example, when promoting a new farming method, cadres or technicians first teach production experts or activists, and use them as the core to pass on technology to the women.

Third, when using typical experiments and organizing demonstrations and competitions to promote technology, pay attention to absorbing a certain number of women to participate; when convening production representative meetings, mutual aid and cooperation representative meetings, technicians and old farmers' symposiums of cooperatives in each production season, or exchanging technical experience through mutual aid and cooperation networks and technical promotion stations, also absorb a certain number of women to participate in learning.

Fourth, regularly impart technology to women and explain general agricultural knowledge through people's schools and technical night schools. In some areas, it is possible to promote the practice of people's schools and technical night schools using real objects to teach according to the agricultural season and production needs. For example, when a pest occurs, pull out a diseased crop, explain in class what kind of pest it is, the harm of this pest to crops, what methods to use to treat it, how to mix the medicine, and how to treat it. In this way, after classroom explanation and field experiments, it is easier to learn.

Fifth, when counties, districts, and townships hold training classes to train technicians, absorb a certain proportion of women to participate in the training. Some agricultural production cooperatives are equipped with female technicians, and the effect of mobilizing women to learn technology through them is very good.

Organizing women to learn technology is a very important task in the agricultural production increase movement; at the same time, organizing women to learn technology is itself a process of fighting against backward and conservative ideas. Therefore, this work can only be carried out well under the unified leadership of the Party branch. Party branches in various regions should enthusiastically care for and support women's requirements for learning technology, promote agricultural production cooperatives to include organizing women to learn technology in the cooperative's technology promotion plan, give priority to women learning the techniques of farm work that are suitable for women's physical strength and should be undertaken by women, and often help women overcome various difficulties in learning and encourage their confidence in learning. In organizing women to learn technology, women's federations should always pay attention to understanding women's learning situation and problems, summarize and promote advanced experiences, and promptly report to the Party committee and relevant departments, and help women overcome various difficulties in learning technology as much as possible, so that women's requirements for learning technology can be realized with the support and help of all parties.

    发动农村妇女学习农业技术
    中华全国民主妇女联合会研究室副主任　王照
    随着农业合作化和农业增产运动的发展，近几年来，农业生产技术进行了一系列的改革。在技术改革过程中，妇女起了很大的作用。不少妇女已经学会选种、浸种、合理密植、间苗、移苗、补苗、改良品种、棉花整枝打?、积肥、防除病虫害等农业生产技术，甚至在某些方面妇女已经成为主要力量。如河北省的玉米人工授粉，现在大部由妇女担任。在经济作物区，妇女参加技术管理工作的更为普遍。河南省各地的棉花和烟叶的技术管理工作，已经基本上由妇女担任。
    在学习和推广农业技术中，出现了不少女技术员和生产能手。黑龙江省1954年的统计，各种女技术员有3，882人。各地农业生产合作社都注意了培养各种女技术员，有的地区已经做到每一个社、每一个生产队都有女技术员。不少地区还注意培养各种驾驶马拉农具和拖拉机的妇女能手。
    我国农村妇女，由于几千年来的封建束缚，在农业技术上一般落后于男子，虽然解放以后几年来逐渐有了改变，但总的来说，她们的技术水平还是较低，还赶不上生产发展的需要。这一方面是由于有些男干部对妇女学习技术的重要性认识不足，有封建保守思想，认为“妇女落后”，学不好，而没有认真给妇女学习技术创造良好的条件。另一方面，妇女本身还或多或少的有封建思想和依赖思想，而许多地方的妇联组织对这一问题也还没有认真地加以研究和解决。这样就使妇女技术水平的提高受到限制。目前有些农业生产合作社实行包工定额管理，女社员因为技术水平低，做得慢，质量差，而妨害了社的生产任务的完成，并且影响了她们的生产积极性。
    农业的增产需要农民掌握农业生产技术。农村妇女占农村人口的一半，因此目前更应该特别重视发动和组织妇女学习她们体力所能胜任的各种农业技术，以适应农业生产的需要，和进一步发挥妇女在生产中的积极作用。
    要发动妇女学习农业技术，必须对男农民特别是基层干部进行教育，使他们认识妇女学习技术的重要性。打破某些基层干部和男农民歧视妇女的封建思想，和不愿意把自己的技术传授给妇女的保守思想，使他们认识妇女学会技术对增产的意义；并及时表扬教妇女学习技术有成绩的男农民。对妇女也要进行学习技术的重要性的教育，使她们认识到只有提高农业技术才能更好地参加生产，为社会主义建设作出更大的贡献，才能进一步提高自己在社会和家庭中的地位。组织妇女学习农业生产技术，要因地制宜。在大田作物地区，应该组织妇女学习一般的农业技术，如选种、间苗、锄草、收割、打场、积肥、防治病虫害、使用新式农具和玉米人工授粉等。在经济作物地区，要组织妇女学习棉、茶、麻、烟等方面的技术管理工作，这些技术管理工作不仅费工大、需要细心和耐心，妇女做起来比较合适，而且对妇女的体力也较为适宜。在山区，随着果木、林业、牧畜等多种经济的发展，需要组织妇女学习果木管理、养蜂、养蚕、养猪、养鸡和畜牧等各种技术。在城市郊区，主要是组织妇女学习蔬菜生产技术。在劳动力缺乏、耕作粗糙、土地潜力很大的地区，应该十分重视妇女学习农业技术，以发挥她们的劳动潜力。总之，要根据需要和可能从多方面来发动和组织妇女学习技术，以适应农业增产的要求。
    组织妇女学习技术的方法，目前根据各地经验有如下几点：
    第一、开展群众性的互教互学。号召有技术的农民教妇女学习技术。提倡男教女学，互教互学来广泛展开妇女学习技术的活动，使妇女普遍能掌握一般的耕作技术。
    第二、培养传授技术的骨干，通过骨干层层带动妇女学习技术。如在推广某种新的耕作方法的时候，由干部或技术员先教给生产能手或积极分子，以她们为核心来向妇女群众传授技术。
    第三、在运用典型试验，组织观摩、评比等方法推广技术的时候，注意吸收一定数量的妇女参加；在每个生产季节召开生产代表会、互助合作代表会、合作社的技术员和老农座谈会或通过互助合作网、技术推广站交流技术经验的时候，也吸收一定数量的妇女参加学习。
    第四、通过民校和技术夜校定期地向妇女传授技术，讲解一般的农业知识。有的地区的民校和技术夜校，按农业季节和生产的需要，采用实物教课的办法是可以推行的。如在发生虫灾的时候，就拔一棵受害的农作物，在课堂上讲这是什么虫害，这种虫对庄稼的危害性，用什么方法治，怎样配药，怎样治等。这样经过课堂讲解，再经过实地试验，学起来就较容易。
    第五、县、区、乡举办训练班培养技术员的时候，吸收一定比例的妇女参加训练。有的农业生产合作社里配备了女技术员，通过她们来带动妇女学习技术，效果很好。
    组织妇女学习技术，是农业增产运动中一件非常重要的工作；同时，组织妇女学技术本身又是同落后保守思想斗争的过程，因此，这项工作在党支部的统一领导下才有可能很好地进行。各地党支部要热情地关心和支持妇女学习技术的要求，推动农业生产合作社把组织妇女学习技术列入社的技术推广计划中，对适合妇女体力又应该由妇女担任的农活的技术要优先让妇女学习，并且经常帮助妇女克服学习中的各种困难，鼓舞她们学习的信心。妇联组织在组织妇女学习技术中要经常注意了解妇女学习的情况和问题，总结推广先进经验，及时地向党委和有关部门反映，尽可能帮助妇女克服在学习技术中的各种困难，以使妇女学习技术的要求在各方面的支持和帮助下得以实现。
