    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 4th: Over 50,000 people from all walks of life in Hanoi held a rally and demonstration on the afternoon of March 4th to oppose Ngo Dinh Diem's unilateral election held in South Vietnam on this day, and demanded the reconvening of the Geneva Conference.

    Participants in the rally included representatives from the Vietnam Fatherland Front, various democratic parties, people's organizations, religious circles, ethnic minorities, people from all walks of life in Hanoi, and representatives of South Vietnamese people in North Vietnam.

    Nguyen Xuan Thuy spoke on behalf of the Central Committee of the Fatherland Front at the rally. He pointed out that the United States and Ngo Dinh Diem's organization of a unilateral election was an attempt to undermine the Geneva Accords and permanently divide Vietnam, turning South Vietnam into a colony and military base of the United States. He emphasized that the Vietnamese people resolutely oppose this conspiracy.

    Nguyen Xuan Thuy expressed full support for the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's proposal to reconvene the Geneva Conference on Indochina to discuss guaranteeing the implementation of the Geneva Accords. He called on the Vietnamese people to fight for the establishment of normal relations between North and South Vietnam and for the reconvening of the Geneva Conference.

    Gao Chao Fa, a representative of the Cao Dai religion, and Father Luong Minh Ky, who came from South Vietnam, also spoke at the rally. They unanimously condemned the conspiracy of the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to undermine the peaceful reunification of Vietnam and expressed their firm support for the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's proposal to reconvene the Geneva Conference.

    The rally finally passed a resolution opposing Ngo Dinh Diem's unilateral election and demanding the reconvening of the Geneva Conference. After the rally, more than 50,000 people held a demonstration in the city.
