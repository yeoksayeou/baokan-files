Editorial:

    The American-made military reconnaissance balloons intercepted in our airspace were publicly exhibited in Beijing on the 7th. The exhibited objects prove that the U.S. released these balloons entirely for the purpose of military reconnaissance and the surreptitious photography of our terrain. This is a serious military provocation by the U.S. authorities that infringes upon our airspace.

    These balloons have a plastic sphere 36-40 feet in diameter, with a military reconnaissance camera and various supporting equipment suspended below. The total weight of the equipment is approximately 600 kilograms. These balloons are released from certain U.S. military bases in the West and, taking advantage of the west-to-east, circumpolar "westerly jet stream," intrude into our airspace to photograph our terrain and features. Among the negatives obtained from the high-altitude cameras intercepted in our country are photographs of the terrain of the Luan River area in our country. This is irrefutable ironclad proof. The U.S. crime of conducting military reconnaissance against our country cannot be denied in any way.

    The U.S. authorities strongly argue that the U.S. releases these balloons for meteorological exploration. However, strangely, the entire set of equipment of these balloons, which we intercepted after they had been floating for five or six days, with the exception of a very rudimentary radiosonde, which could only detect the weather conditions upon take-off and could only work for a few hours, was entirely for the automatic photography of terrain features. At the same time, people have reason to ask the U.S. authorities what relationship the terrain photographs of the Luan River area of our country have with U.S. meteorological research. Facts speak louder than words. The purpose of the U.S. in releasing these balloons is absolutely not for the benefit of mankind through meteorological exploration, but for military reconnaissance in preparation for war.

    The U.S. authorities also say that the U.S. releases these balloons without hindering shipping and is therefore harmless. This is deceptive nonsense. Anyone can understand that any civil aviation aircraft is bound to crash if it encounters such a huge balloon weighing approximately 600 kilograms. Such a tragic event has already occurred in Czechoslovakia. Irrefutable facts prove that this act of releasing military reconnaissance balloons by the U.S. government is not only a military provocation against the countries concerned, but also directly threatens the lives and safety of peace-loving people.

    All peace-loving countries and people cannot tolerate this provocative act of releasing military reconnaissance balloons by the U.S. We fully support the serious protest made by the spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the U.S. government on February 7th, and resolutely demand that the U.S. government immediately stop this act which violates all international law, threatens our security, and endangers world peace.

### 抗议美国放送军事侦察气球

    抗议美国放送军事侦察气球
    在我国领空截获的美制军事侦察气球，7日在北京公开展览出来了。展出的实物证明，美国放送这种气球，完全是为了进行军事侦察，盗摄我国地形，这是美国当局严重地侵犯我国领空的军事挑衅行为。
    这种气球有个直径36——40英尺长的塑胶球体，下面悬挂着军事侦察摄影机，和为它服务的各种设备。全部设备重约600公斤。这种气球从西方的某些美国军事基地放出，借着由西到东的、环绕地球的“西风急流带”侵入我国上空，拍摄我国的地形和地物。从我国截获这种高空摄影机里取得的底片中，就有我国滦河地区的地形相片图，这是有目共睹的铁证，美国对我国进行军事侦察的罪行，是怎样也抵赖不了的。
    美国当局强辩说美国放送这种气球是为了进行气象探测的。但是奇怪的是我国截获的这种飘行五、六天的气球的整套设备，除去一个非常简陋的只能探测起飞上空气象，而且只能工作几小时的无线电探空仪而外，其余全部都是为着自动摄影机拍摄地形相片服务的。同时，人们有理由责问美国当局，我国滦河地区的地形相片图究竟和美国的气象研究有什么关系。事实胜于雄辩，美国放送这种气球的目的绝不是为了什么探测气象造福人类，而是为了军事侦察，准备战争。
    美国当局还说，美国放送的这种气球并不妨害航运，因而是无害的。这是骗人的胡说，谁都可以懂得，任何一架民航飞机，只要碰上这样一个重约600公斤的庞大的气球就必然失事。而这种惨痛事件已经在捷克斯洛伐克发生过了。无可辩驳的事实证明，美国政府这种放送军事侦察气球的行为，不仅是对有关各国的军事挑衅，而且直接威胁着和平人民的生命和安全。
    一切爱好和平的国家和人民都不能容忍美国这种放送军事侦察气球的挑衅行为。我们完全支持2月7日我国外交部发言人对于美国政府提出的严重抗议，并且坚决要求美国政府立即制止这种破坏一切国际公法、威胁我国安全和危害世界和平的行为。
