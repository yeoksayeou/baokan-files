The Development of Trade Relations Between China, India, and Burma
Wang Zhaoxun

With the strengthening of friendly relations between China and India and Burma, trade between China and India and Burma has also greatly developed in the past year or so.

After the signing of the Sino-Indian Trade Agreement on October 14, 1954, the trade volume between the two countries increased significantly. From January to October 1955, China's total exports to India increased two and a half times compared with the same period in 1954; total imports from India increased more than nine times. While the trade volume increased, the types of commodities exchanged between the two countries also expanded. Last year, China began to import a considerable amount of cotton from India, and more than 20 new commodities such as steel, soda ash, and newsprint began to be exported to India. China is now able to supply India with chemicals, lathes, textile machinery, machine tools and other industrial products that it needs.

In the past year, the number of Indian industrialists and businessmen who visited China or negotiated transactions has also increased compared with before. Most of them have made transactions with China's state-owned import and export corporations. Some Indian business people, after visiting China and returning to India, are also preparing to organize companies specializing in Sino-Indian trade to promote Sino-Indian trade.

Trade between China's Tibet region and India has also developed since the signing of the Agreement on Trade and Intercourse between the Tibet Region of China and India by the governments of China and India on April 29, 1954. In 1955, the total import and export volume of China's Tibet region to India increased compared with 1954. According to this agreement, China has established a commercial agency in Calcutta, India, to strengthen trade ties between the two countries.

During the Indian Industries Fair, which closed on January 1 this year, the Chinese Pavilion received great praise from the Indian people and business community. The Chinese exhibition group received more than 2,500 inquiries from the Indian business community regarding Sino-Indian trade. Indian business people expressed great interest in Chinese machinery and expressed their hope to further develop import and export trade between China and India.

In recent years, trade exchanges between China and Burma have also greatly developed. In November 1954, the governments of China and Burma signed a barter agreement for Burmese rice and Chinese export commodities. In March 1955, the Burmese government procurement delegation visited China and signed a purchase contract with China's state-owned import and export corporations, and the trade volume between the two countries also greatly increased. From January to October 1955, China's total exports to Burma increased 22 times compared with the same period in 1954, and total imports from Burma increased more than 27 times. China's exported goods are mainly industrial products such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, knitwear, hardware, steel, and newsprint. When the first batch of Chinese goods arrived in Burma, they were warmly welcomed by the Burmese people. The Burmese Department of Civil Supplies believes that Chinese cotton yarn is very good in all aspects. Burmese business people believe that Chinese cotton cloth is fine in texture, white in bleaching, and cheap in price. They requested that China continue to export this cotton cloth. Relevant departments of the Burmese government are also very interested in the good quality and low price of Chinese hardware and steel.

China not only supplies Burma with consumer industrial products it needs, but is also prepared to supply Burma with complete sets of light industrial equipment. Last July, at the invitation of the Burmese government, the Chinese government dispatched a team of textile experts to Burma to conduct research and has agreed to supply Burma with complete sets of cotton textile mill equipment.

China, India, and Burma are all rich in resources and are all engaged in economic construction. The commodities that each needs to import and can export will inevitably gradually increase. For example, in recent years, China's industrial and agricultural production has developed rapidly, and the first five-year plan will be completed ahead of schedule, and great changes will take place in both demand and supply. Commodities that China did not need to import in the past, or imported very little, may be imported in large quantities in the future. For example, China used to import very little tobacco from India, but last year there was a large increase. Commodities that China could not export in the past, or exported very little, may also be exported in large quantities in the future. For example, China was unable to export steel, chemical products, newsprint, etc. in the past, but last year it began to export to India and Burma.

The strengthening of economic cooperation between China and India and Burma based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit is of great benefit to the industrial construction currently underway in our three countries. For example, in 1954, Burmese rice was unsalable, and China purchased 150,000 tons of rice from it, which played a considerable role in alleviating Burma's economic difficulties. Burmese Prime Minister U Nu pointed out on May 28, 1955: "The trade agreement concluded between China and Burma greatly alleviated the Burmese economic crisis, which was caused by a large amount of surplus rice that was difficult to handle." India's "Lightning News" also pointed out: "China's trade with many countries is carried out on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. China's large-scale economic construction will provide a broad market. If India works hard, it is entirely possible to expand trade with China." Obviously, expanding trade ties between India and Burma and China will help promote the smooth development of industrial construction in India and Burma. Similarly, it is also of great significance to accelerating China's industrialization. For example, it is more convenient for China's Tibet region to import commodities such as grain and cloth from India in terms of transportation than to transport them from inland China; and China, India, and Burma are neighbors, and developing trade with each other can save transportation costs and time, which is beneficial to all three of us.

The economic cooperation relationship between China and India and Burma based on equality and mutual benefit is fully in line with the spirit of the Asian-African Conference resolution. The joint efforts of our three countries to strengthen economic cooperation are not only beneficial to the people of the three countries and warmly welcomed by the people of the three countries, but will also further promote the friendly coexistence of China, India, and Burma and contribute to peace in Asia.

    我国同印度、缅甸贸易关系的发展
    王兆勋
    随着我国和印度、缅甸友好关系的加强，一年多来我国和印度、缅甸的贸易也有很大的发展。
    1954年10月14日中印贸易协定签订后，两国贸易额有了显著的增加。1955年1月至10月，我国对印度出口总值比1954年同期增加了两倍半；自印度进口总值增加了九倍多。在贸易额增加的同时，两国交换的商品种类也扩大了。去年我国开始从印度进口了相当数量的棉花，我国的钢材、纯碱、白报纸等20多种新商品也开始输往印度。中国已经能够供给为印度所需要的化学品、车床、纺织机器、工作母机及其它工业品。
    去年一年间，印度工商业家到我国来访问或洽谈交易的人数也比以前增多，他们大多数都和我国国营进出口专业公司做成了交易。有些印度的企业界人士在访问我国回到印度后，还筹备组织专营中印贸易的公司，以促进中印贸易。
    我国西藏地方和印度的贸易，自1954年4月29日中印两国政府签订了关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定后也有了发展。1955年我国西藏地方对印度的进出口额都比1954年增加了。根据这个协定，我国已在印度加尔各答成立了商务代理处，以加强两国的贸易联系。
    在今年1月1日闭幕的印度工业博览会举行期间，中国馆受到了印度人民和贸易界人士的极大的称赞，中国展览团共收到了印度工商业界2，500次以上有关中印贸易的询问。印度贸易界人士对于中国的机器表示很大的兴趣，他们表示希望能使中印两国的进出口贸易得到更大的发展。
    我国和缅甸的贸易交往，近年以来也有了很大的发展。1954年11月，中缅两国政府签订了缅甸大米同中国出口商品的换货议定书。1955年3月，缅甸政府采购团曾访问我国，同我国国营进出口专业公司签订了购货合同，两国的贸易额也有了大大的增加。1955年1月至10月，我国对缅甸出口总值比1954年同期增加了22倍，自缅甸进口总值增加了27倍多。我国出口的货物，主要是棉纱、棉布、针织品、五金钢材、白报纸等工业品。当我国首批货物运到缅甸时，受到缅甸人民的热烈欢迎。缅甸民用品供应局认为我国的棉纱在一切方面都很好。缅甸商界人士认为，我国的棉布质地细，漂色白和价格便宜。他们要求我国继续输出这种棉布。缅甸政府各有关部门对我国的五金钢材质量好，价格低，也感到极大的兴趣。
    我国不仅供应缅甸需要的消费工业品，还准备供应缅甸以轻工业的成套设备。去年7月，我国政府应缅甸政府的邀请，派遣了纺织专家小组到缅甸去进行研究后，已同意供应缅甸以棉纺织厂的成套设备。
    我国和印度、缅甸的物产都很丰富，而且都在进行经济建设，彼此需要进口和可供出口的商品必然会逐渐增多。比如近几年来我国工农业生产迅速发展，第一个五年计划将提前完成，需求和供应都将发生很大的变化。过去我国不需要进口或进口很少的商品，今后可能大量输入。如我国过去从印度进口烟叶的数量很少，去年就有了很大增加。过去我国不能出口或出口很少的商品，今后也可能大量输出。如我国过去不能出口钢材、化工制品、白报纸等，但是去年已开始向印度、缅甸出口了。
    我国和印度、缅甸基于平等互利原则的经济合作的加强，对于我们三个国家目前正在进行的工业建设是有很大好处的。例如，1954年缅甸大米滞销，我国向它购买了15万吨大米，这对减轻缅甸经济困难是有相当作用的。缅甸总理吴努1955年5月28日就曾指出：“中缅两国缔结的贸易协定大大地缓和了缅甸的经济危机，这种危机是由于难以处理的大量剩余大米所造成的。”印度“闪电报”也指出：“中国同许多国家的贸易都是在平等互利的基础上进行的，中国大规模经济建设将提供广阔的市场，如果印度努力的话，同中国扩大贸易是十分可能的”。显然，印度、缅甸同我国扩大贸易往来，将有助于促进印度和缅甸工业建设的顺利发展。同样，对于加速我国工业化也具有重大的意义。例如，我国西藏地方从印度输入粮食、布匹等商品，在交通上较之由我国内地运往更加便利；而我国同印度、缅甸是近邻，互相发展贸易，更可节省运输费用和时间，这是对我们三国都有利的。
    我国和印度、缅甸这种平等互利的经济合作关系，是完全符合于亚非会议决议的精神的。我们三国之间加强经济合作的共同努力，不仅有利于三国人民，受到三国人民的热烈欢迎，而且也将更加促进中印缅三国的友好相处，有助于亚洲的和平。
