Xinhua News Agency, 20th: The Ministry of Railways plans to build more than 2,000 kilometers of new railways this year. The new railway lines built this year will increase by more than 60% compared to last year. From 1953 to 1955, the railway department has already built more than 2,600 kilometers of new railways, leaving only more than 1,400 kilometers of tasks stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan. If this year's plan can be completed on schedule, by the end of this year, the railway department will have overfulfilled the total new railway track-laying plan stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan.

The construction plans for several important railway trunk lines stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan will be completed ahead of schedule or overfulfilled this year. The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway was originally planned to be built to Baiyanghe, near the Yumen Oilfield, 830 kilometers from Lanzhou, in 1957. This plan is expected to be completed ahead of schedule on "July 1st" this year, and track-laying will continue westward from Yumen to Heishan Gorge, about 1,000 kilometers from Lanzhou, within the year. The Baoji-Chengdu Railway, which connects the Northwest and Southwest, was originally planned to be fully completed in 1957, but it may now be connected and opened to traffic ahead of schedule on "July 1st" this year.

    宝成路争取“七一”通车
    兰新路今年要铺轨到黑山峡
    新华社20日讯　　铁道部计划在今年修建两千多公里新铁路。今年新修的铁路线，比去年增加60％以上。1953到1955年三年内，铁路部门已经修好了二千六百多公里新铁路，第一个五年计划规定的任务只剩下一千四百多公里。今年的计划如能按期完成，到今年年底，铁路部门就将超额完成第一个五年计划规定的总的新建铁路铺轨计划。
    第一个五年计划规定的几条重要铁路干线的修建计划，都将在今年提前或超额完成。兰新路原计划在1957年修到距兰州830公里的玉门油矿附近的白洋河。这个计划预计可以提前在今年“七一”完成，年内还要继续从玉门向西铺轨到距兰州约一千公里的黑山峡。贯通西北和西南的宝成铁路，原计划在1957年全线修通，现在可能提前在今年“七一”接轨通车。
