Xinhua News Agency, March 1st: The First National Drama Festival opened in Beijing today.

Minister of Culture Shen Yanbing delivered the opening address. He said: Following Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policy of "serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers" and the creative principles of socialist realism, drama workers across the country have achieved certain successes in reflecting reality and educating the people with socialist ideology. This festival will serve to review past achievements, exchange experiences in drama creation and performance, and reward outstanding creators and drama workers, in order to further promote the prosperity and improvement of drama art, so that it can better serve socialist construction and meet the growing cultural needs of the broad masses of the people. Shen Yanbing extended a warm welcome to the playwrights and artists from various countries who were invited to observe this festival.

Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yi spoke at the opening ceremony today. He said that the people of the whole country are currently engaged in socialist construction and socialist transformation. The task of literary and artistic work is to better reflect, promote, and influence socialist construction and socialist transformation. Drama occupies an important position in the arts, and in the revolutionary war period and in the six years after liberation, drama art played an important role in organizing and mobilizing the people. In the stage of socialist revolution, drama will play a greater role, because drama can more directly and comprehensively reflect real life, is loved by the people, and can play a greater educational role. Chen Yi said that it is incorrect to underestimate drama art. He hoped that all drama workers would diligently study Marxism-Leninism, improve their artistic cultivation, go deep into the masses, strengthen artistic practice, and make Chinese drama art flourish with the development of the socialist revolutionary cause.

Diao Guangtan, representing the actors of the 41 drama troupes participating in the festival, thanked the Communist Party and the government for their care and cultivation of the drama industry and drama actors, and expressed that they must humbly learn and strive to create brilliant images of contemporaries in the future.

Subsequently, the presidium of the congress read out congratulatory telegrams from 10 units including the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles to the congress.

Present at the opening ceremony were Zhou Yang, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Qian Junrui, Liu Zhiming, and Xia Yan, Vice Ministers of the Ministry of Culture, Chen Yi, Director of the Cultural Department of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Zhang Xiuzhu, Director of the Propaganda Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Yang Hansheng, Secretary-General of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, literary and art figures Tian Han, Ouyang Yuqian, Lao She, Cao Yu, Cheng Yanqiu, Zhang Geng, Song Zhi's, Ma Yanxiang, Jiao Juyin, Sun Weishi, Lan Ma, Buhe (Mongolian), Tu Naenkse (Uygur), people from all walks of life in the capital, and all the actors, staff, and observers from various places participating in the festival, totaling more than 2,500 people.
