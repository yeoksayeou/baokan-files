The Key Lies in Overcoming Conservative Thinking of Leaders
    Li Jiaxun

Since the beginning of this year, the Sichuan Yibin 602 Paper Mill has had very poor performance in completing the national plan. By early February, all products and paper machines had failed to meet their targets. The total output plan for January was only 88.38% fulfilled, the production level was 4% lower than in December of last year, accidents were frequent, and there were many defective products. From January to February, paper loss exceeding the plan reached 59.5 tons.

Why did the 602 Paper Mill fail to complete its production plan? The most important reason is that the leading staff had right-leaning conservative ideas. In early January, although the factory leaders mobilized the workers to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, they did not propose specific measures to guarantee its early completion. Many current production problems, such as the reduced speed of each paper machine, large losses, and continuous discovery of issues like felt blooming, uneven drying, and paper cracking on both large and small paper machines, did not attract the attention of the leadership, resulting in a shortfall of 28.4 tons of paper in January. What is particularly serious is that some leading staff even believed that this was a "normal pattern" and would "normalize" in a few days. Instead of actively improving the leadership of production technology, they believed that problems such as paper cracking and felt blooming were caused by hard rubber rollers and cold weather, and there was no way to solve them now, so things would naturally improve when the weather got warmer. Under the guidance of this erroneous thinking, they reduced production. After the speed of each paper machine was reduced, a total of 32.4 tons of paper was underproduced in January and early February.

At the beginning of January, the workers of this factory put forward their guarantees to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. However, the leadership did not promptly guide them and did not actively support many suggestions made by the workers. For example, the suggestion made by Group 325 of the papermaking workshop in early January to improve the sedimentation tank partition and shorten the cleaning time had not been studied and dealt with by the end of January. In order to reduce black spots on the paper, the workers of No. 4 paper machine suggested pre-heating the felt with hot water. The workers raised this suggestion four or five times, but the leadership ignored it, greatly dampening the workers' enthusiasm.

In mid-February, the factory convened a congress of all factory worker representatives. At the meeting, in addition to criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking, the leading staff also decided to launch an advanced producer movement throughout the factory. After this news spread, all the workers in the factory were extremely excited, and the situation of failing to complete the plan began to reverse. On the 16th, the workers of Group 324 in the papermaking workshop proposed to clean the screening machine and sedimentation tank without stopping the machine to increase production. The experiment was successful the next day, shortening the downtime for cleaning by more than 50 minutes compared to the past, and increasing the production of newsprint by about 10 reams that day. After this method was promoted throughout the workshop, it can increase the production of newsprint by more than 100 tons for the country every year. No. 5 paper machine, which had failed to complete the plan since the beginning of the year, was studied and adjusted by workers and technicians together on February 20 to regulate the weir frame and weir plate, overcome the problem of rib edge paper defects, and increase the speed from 129 meters per minute to 136 meters per minute, finally overfulfilling the production plan by 1.66%. On February 19, the workers of the third shift of No. 4 paper machine in the papermaking workshop created a new record of production exceeding the national plan by 11.7%, and the quality also met the standards. In the recent 20 days, the workers in the power workshop have put forward 76 rationalization proposals, of which 29 have been studied and adopted. The technicians in the mechanical pulp workshop are collectively brewing a method of using 100% mechanical wood pulp to make paper, in order to save caustic soda, sodium sulfide, and bleaching powder for the country. All this shows that only by overcoming conservative thinking, deeply mobilizing and relying on the masses, can the leadership complete the production tasks.

    关键在于克服领导的保守思想
    李家樳
    今年以来，四川宜宾602造纸厂完成国家计划的情况很坏，到2月上旬，各种产品、各部纸机都没有完成计划。1月份总产量计划只完成88.38％，生产水平比去年12月降低了4％，事故多，废品也多，1—2月超计划损纸达59.5吨。
    602厂为什么没有完成生产计划呢？最重要的是领导工作人员有右倾保守思想。1月上旬，厂的领导虽然动员职工提前完成五年计划，但是，没有提出保证提前完成五年计划的具体措施。当前生产上的许多问题，例如各部纸机车速降低、损失大、大小纸机不断发现毛布起花、干湿不匀和纸张爆口等，都未引起领导上的注意，1月份因而少产纸28.4吨。尤其严重的是：有的领导工作人员竟认为这是“常年规律”，过两天就会“正常”的。他们不积极改进生产技术的领导工作，反而认为纸张爆口、毛布起花等毛病是因为胶辊硬和天气冷所引起的，现在没办法解决，等天气热了就会自然好转。在这种错误的思想指导下，他们压缩了产量。各台纸机的车速减低以后，1月份和2月份上旬共少产纸32.4吨。
    1月初，这个厂的职工群众为了提前完成五年计划，纷纷提出了自己的保证，但是，领导上没有及时加以领导，对职工提出的许多建议没有积极支持。例如，造纸车间325组在1月初提出的改进沉沙槽隔板，缩短清洗时间的建议，到1月底还没有研究处理。为了减少纸张黑疤，4号纸机工人提出预热水洗毛布的建议，工人提出了四、五次，领导上也不理睬，大大锉伤了工人的积极性。
    2月中旬，工厂才召开了全厂职工代表大会。会上，领导工作人员除对右倾保守思想进行了批判外，还决定在全厂开展先进生产者运动。这个消息传出后，全厂职工都极为振奋，完不成计划的情况开始扭转。16日，造纸车间324组工人提出不停车清洗筛浆机和沉沙槽，以增加产量，第二天就试验成功，使停车清洗时间比过去缩短50多分钟，当天就增产了约10令新闻纸。这个办法在全车间推广后，每年可给国家增产新闻纸100多吨。今年以来一直没有完成计划的5号造纸机，在2月20日经工人和技术员一起研究，调节了堰架、堰板，克服了筋边纸病，使车速由每分钟129公尺提高到136公尺，终于超额1.66％完成了生产计划。2月19日，造纸车间4号纸机三班工人创造了产量超过国家计划11.7％的新纪录，质量也达到标准。动力车间工人们在最近的20天中，提出了76件合理化建议，已经研究采纳的有29件。机械浆车间的技术人员正在集体酝酿用100％的机械木浆造纸的办法，为国家节约烧碱、硫化碱和漂白粉。这一切都说明：只有领导上克服保守思想，深入发动，依靠群众，生产任务才能完成。
