    Yan'an, Full of Youthful Vigor
    By Our Correspondent Zhu Bo
    From the day the delegates to the Five Provinces (Regions) Youth Afforestation Conference arrived in Yan'an, this ancient city became as vibrant as spring. From Du Fu Chuan to Zaoyuan, where the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao once lived, the 20-mile-long valley was filled with the laughter of youth representatives and the sound of gongs and drums from the people of Yan'an welcoming them. The people of Yan'an mobilized to welcome the youth representatives with practical actions. Together with the people of Yijun, Huangling, and Ganquan counties, they organized more than 130 greening highway shock brigades, totaling nearly 20,000 people, and planted more than 90,000 trees along the Xian-Yu Highway, forming a high tide of spring afforestation. On the mountain tops near Zaoyuan, Yangjialing, Wangjiaping, and other places, with the labor songs of Yan'an youth, patches of young saplings appeared.
    The noble enthusiasm of the people of Yan'an deeply moved the youth representatives from all over the country. They unanimously expressed that they must take this opportunity to humbly learn from the people of Yan'an, who have a glorious revolutionary tradition. They all inquired very carefully about Yan'an's past, not willing to miss even a single blade of grass or tree. In Zaoyuan, the youth representatives stayed in the courtyard where Chairman Mao lived, asking the youth of Zaoyuan about Chairman Mao's past life and work. They looked very carefully at the pagoda trees in the courtyard where Chairman Mao lived and the nearby paths. They recorded what they heard and saw in their diaries. Some representatives even drew the cave dwellings that Chairman Mao had visited, so that they could tell other young people when they returned. Lu Shiyi, a Tibetan youth representative from Gansu Province, said: "I must bring back the spirit of hard work and plain living of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, so that Tibetan youth can use this spirit to complete the task of greening the motherland." Huang Genpin, a forestry technician from Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, said: "I have deeply fallen in love with Yan'an. I sincerely request the organization to approve my staying here and greening the revolutionary holy land together with the youth of Yan'an." Now, he is using his spare time to help design the landscape plan for Yangjialing.
    While visiting Zaoyuan, many youth representatives climbed the pagoda trees in front of the cave dwellings where Chairman Mao and Vice-Chairman Zhu lived to collect seeds. They packed the seeds separately and wrote down which package was Chairman Mao's seeds and which package was Vice-Chairman Zhu's seeds... Hao Huiqing and Pan Wang, youth representatives from Taiyuan City, said: "These are Chairman Mao's seeds, we must cultivate them and make them grow." Shang Dingzhou, a representative from Tongxin County, Wu Zhong Hui Autonomous Region, Gansu Province, carefully wrapped the seeds he collected in a handkerchief. He said that these were seeds that had undergone arduous training, and after returning, he would sow them in the best nursery to make Chairman Mao's pagoda trees grow everywhere in our Tongxin County.

    充满青春活力的延安
    本报记者  朱波
    从出席五省（区）青年造林大会的代表到达延安的那天起，延安这个古城里也像春天一样的活跃起来。从杜甫川到党中央和毛主席曾经住过的地方——枣园，长达20里的山谷里，到处洋溢着青年代表的欢笑声，和延安人民欢迎他们的锣鼓声。延安人民动员起来，以实际行动来欢迎青年代表们。他们曾和宜君、黄陵、甘泉等县的人民，组织了包括近两万人的130多个绿化公路突击队，沿咸榆公路植树9万多株，形成了春季植树造林的热潮。在枣园、杨家岭、王家坪等附近的山头上，随着延安青年们的劳动歌声，出现了一片一片幼小的树苗。
    延安人民这种高贵的热情，深深地感动了各地的青年代表，他们一致表示：一定要利用这个机会，虚心地向有着光荣革命传统的延安人民学习。他们都非常细心地向人们询问着延安的过去，那怕是一草一木都不愿意放过。在枣园，青年代表们停留在毛主席住过的院子里，向枣园的青年询问毛主席过去的生活和工作情形。他们对毛主席住过的院子里的洋槐树和附近的小路，都非常仔细地看来看去。把听到的和看到的都记在日记本上，有的代表还把毛主席到过的窑洞画下来，以便回去后讲给其他青年听。甘肃省藏族青年代表卢世义说：“我一定要把党中央和毛主席的艰苦朴素作风带回去，让藏族青年都能以这种精神来完成绿化祖国的任务。”浙江省杭州市林业技术员黄根品说：“我深深地爱上了延安，我诚恳地请求组织上能够批准我留下来，和延安青年一道把革命圣地绿化起来。”现在，他正利用休息的时间，帮助设计杨家岭的园林图。
    在参观枣园的时候，很多青年代表爬上毛主席和朱副主席住过的窑洞前边的洋槐树上采集树种。他们把树种分别地包起来，并记上那一包是毛主席的树种，那一包是朱副主席的树种……。太原市的青年代表郝惠卿和潘旺说：“这是毛主席的树种，我们一定要把它培育起来，使它成长起来。”甘肃省吴忠回族自治区同心县的代表尚定周把自己采集的树种，很小心地用手帕包起来，他说，这是经过艰苦锻炼的种子，回去后把它撒在最好的苗圃里，使我们同心县到处都生长起毛主席的洋槐。（附图片）
