    Successful Trial Production of Cast Iron Sand Injection Pipes
    The Casting Pipe Factory of Anshan Iron and Steel Company has recently successfully trial-produced a type of sand injection pipe using high-grade cast iron and chromium-added white cast iron, and has already begun formal production. This sand injection pipe can be used to replace high-manganese steel pipes or high-carbon steel pipes for filling mines with sand in the coal mining industry. This sand injection pipe has high wear resistance. According to trial use by the Fushun Mining Bureau, the wear resistance of this sand injection pipe is higher than that of high-manganese steel pipes or high-carbon steel pipes, but the cost is much lower.

    试制生铁注砂管成功
    鞍山钢铁公司铸管厂最近用高级铸铁和加铬的白口生铁试制成功一种注砂管，并且已经开始正式生产。这种注砂管可用来代替高锰钢管或高炭钢管，在采煤工业中向矿洞充填砂子。这种注砂管有很高的耐磨性。据抚顺矿务局试用证明，这种注砂管的耐磨性比高锰钢管或高炭钢管都高，成本却低很多。（刘兆泉、白林材）
