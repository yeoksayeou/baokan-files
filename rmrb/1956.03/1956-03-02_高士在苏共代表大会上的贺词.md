Ghosh's Congratulatory Message to the CPSU Congress

    Dear Comrades! Allow me, on behalf of the Communist Party of India, to extend brotherly and warm congratulations to the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, its Leninist Central Committee, and the entire Soviet people who are leading progressive humanity towards the glorious goal of communism. (Stormy applause)

    The great October Socialist Revolution, which liberated the people of the former Tsarist colonies and exerted a tremendous influence on the entire East, the victory of the democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union over the fascist forces, the historically significant victory of the Chinese people, the victories achieved by the Korean and Vietnamese people in the anti-imperialist struggle, and the tremendous development of the national liberation movement of the colonial people, have ended the old system in the vast lands of the East and brought about profound changes in the world situation.

    The socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, firmly adheres to Lenin's principle of peaceful coexistence and has taken bold steps to ease international tensions and create an atmosphere of goodwill among the people of all countries. These measures have been successful.

    Comrades! The people of the East, who have shaken off the shackles of colonialism and are eager to restore their economies, regard the Soviet Union as a loyal ally, a reliable and selfless friend and brother, which provides assistance without any political obligations. An example of this is the agreement on building a steel plant in India, which will increase the annual output of our steel industry by 1 million tons of steel. This friendship is also reflected in the enthusiastic and unforgettable meetings during the visit of Comrades Bulganin and Khrushchev to India. Everywhere they went, torrents of people crowded the streets. Millions welcomed their every word. The resounding slogan "Hindi-Rusi bhai bhai!" (Indians and Russians are brothers—editor's note) sums up the feelings of the Indian people in this simple but profound form. (Applause)

    The visit of Comrades Bulganin and Khrushchev became a national festival of Soviet-Indian friendship, in which all classes, parties, and strata of residents participated. This festival demonstrated the broadest national unity.

    The Indian people deeply cherish the Soviet Union's position on the Goa and Kashmir issues, which is completely different from that of the American imperialists. This fact shows our people who their true friends are.

    The Joint Declaration signed by Comrades N.A. Bulganin, N.S. Khrushchev, and Mr. Jawaharlal Nehru on December 13, 1955, and the Indian-Soviet Joint Communiqué issued at that time are documents of historical significance. These two documents are a major contribution to peace in Asia and the world, and they show the world that countries with two different political systems can establish friendly relations based on the historically significant principles of "Panchsheel."

    Comrades! The Republic of India ardently desires peace, is committed to consolidating its national freedom, and now plays a significant role on the international stage. It is acting as a world power. India firmly refuses to participate in aggressive blocs and condemns them as a threat to peace and interference by one country in the affairs of another. The peace policy pursued by the Indian government is widely supported by all patriotic and democratic forces in our country.

    The Indian people still have arduous tasks on the road to eliminating the remnants of colonialism and establishing a guaranteed and happy life for the broad masses. However, our party, which stands at the forefront in the struggle for national freedom, for a consistent peace policy, and for raising the living standards of the people, believes that the great Indian people, relying on the national unity of the democratic and patriotic forces of all parties, classes, and strata of residents, will surely be able to achieve these tasks.

    We believe that the friendship between the three great world powers, the Soviet Union, China, and India, will continue to grow and that it is the strongest factor for world peace. (Applause)

    We believe that India—a country with the world's oldest civilization and that has created rare cultural treasures in human history—will make a greater contribution to the world's cultural treasury, and will play a more prominent role in promoting human progress together with all peace loving and progressive forces.

    Long live the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the vanguard of progressive humanity! (Applause)

    Long live the Leninist Central Committee, the embodiment of the collective wisdom, experience, and will of the Soviet people! (Applause)

    Long live the friendship between the Soviet Union and India! (Stormy and prolonged applause, all rise)

    高士在苏共代表大会上的贺词
    亲爱的同志们！请允许我代表印度共产党，向苏联共产党第二十次代表大会、它的列宁式的中央委员会和带领着进步人类走向光辉的目标——共产主义的全体苏联人民，致以兄弟般的热烈祝贺。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    把过去沙皇殖民地的人民解放出来并且给予整个东方以巨大影响的伟大的十月社会主义革命、以苏联为首的民主阵营对法西斯势力的胜利、中国人民有重大历史意义的胜利、朝鲜和越南人民在反帝国主义斗争中所取得的胜利以及殖民地人民民族解放运动的巨大发展，使得在东方辽阔的土地上结束了旧制度，并且使世界局势发生了深刻的变化。
    以苏联和中华人民共和国为首的社会主义阵营，坚定地遵循列宁的和平共处原则，采取了缓和国际紧张局势和创造各国人民间的善意气氛的大胆的步骤。这些措施是成功的。
    同志们！摆脱了殖民主义枷锁和渴望恢复自己的经济的东方人民，把苏联看作是忠实的盟邦、可靠无私的朋友和兄弟，它提供援助是不带任何政治义务的。这样的例子就是关于在印度建筑一座炼钢厂的协定，这个工厂将使我国炼钢工业的年产量增加100万吨钢。这种友情也反映在布尔加宁同志和赫鲁晓夫同志访问印度时的热情的、令人难以忘怀的会见中。在他们所到过的地方，到处都有洪流般的人群挤满了街道。千百万人欢迎他们的每一句话。震荡着响亮的口号：“印地罗斯巴伊巴伊！”（印度人和俄国人是兄弟——编者注）这个形式简单而内容深刻的口号归纳了印度人民的感情。（掌声）
    布尔加宁同志和赫鲁晓夫同志的访问成了印苏友好的全民节日，参加这个节日的有一切阶级、一切党派和一切居民阶层。这个节日证明了最广泛的全民大团结。
    印度人民对苏联在果阿和克什米尔问题上采取的同美国帝国主义者截然相反的立场深为珍视。这一事实向我国人民表明谁是他们的真正朋友。
    1955年12月13日尼·亚·布尔加宁同志、尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志和贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁先生所签署的联合宣言和当时所发表的印度—苏联联合公报是具有历史意义的文件。这两个文件是对亚洲和平和世界和平的一个重大贡献，它们向全世界表明，两个不同政治制度的国家是能够建立以“潘查希拉”这一有历史意义的原则为基础的友好关系的。
    同志们！印度共和国热烈希望和平、致力于巩固自己的民族自由，现在它在国际舞台上起着重大的作用。它作为一个世界大国在进行活动。印度坚决拒绝参加侵略集团，并且谴责它们是对和平的威胁，是一个国家对另一个国家事务的干涉。印度政府所执行的和平政策受到我国所有爱国和民主力量的广泛支持。
    在消除殖民主义残余、在为广大群众建立有保障的幸福生活的道路上，印度人民还有着艰巨的任务。但是，在争取民族自由、争取始终如一的和平政策、争取提高人民生活水平的斗争中站在最前列的我们的党相信：伟大的印度人民依靠各党派、各阶级和各阶层居民的民主力量和爱国力量的民族大团结，必将能够实现这些任务。
    我们相信，苏联、中国和印度三个世界大国的友谊将一直不断地增长，它是世界和平最强大的因素。（掌声）
    我们相信，印度——这一个世界上文明最悠久的、创造了人类历史上稀有的文化宝藏的国家——将对世界文化宝库做出更大的贡献，它将同所有爱好和平的和进步的力量在推动人类向前进步方面起更加卓越的作用。
    进步人类的先锋队苏联共产党万岁！（掌声）
    苏联人民的集体智慧、经验和意志的体现者苏联共产党列宁式的中央委员会万岁！（掌声）
    苏联和印度友谊万岁！（暴风雨般经久不息的掌声，全体起立）
            （原载2月24日苏联“真理报”）（新华社）
