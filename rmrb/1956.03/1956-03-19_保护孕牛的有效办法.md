The Benxi City Food Company Meat Processing Plant in Liaoning Province, from January 27th to February 2nd this year, found that on average, six or seven out of the 20-odd cows slaughtered each day were pregnant. On February 1st, 32 out of the 45 cows slaughtered were pregnant. These cows were all purchased by the plant itself.

The main reason for slaughtering pregnant cows is, on the one hand, that the purchasing staff lacks technical knowledge and cannot accurately identify pregnant cows; on the other hand, some staff members neglect the policy of protecting draught cattle, and regardless of whether the fat cows are vegetable cows, draught cattle, or pregnant cows, they purchase them on a large scale.

In order to comply with the State Council's "Instructions on Preventing Indiscriminate Slaughter of Draught Cattle and Protecting and Developing Draught Cattle," the Benxi City Food Company Meat Processing Plant, in addition to strengthening policy education for purchasing personnel, has also organized two veterinarians to participate in purchasing work to identify pregnant cows and draught cattle. For example, on February 6th, among the 14 cows purchased with the participation of veterinarians, not only were they all old cows, but none of them were pregnant.

    保护孕牛的有效办法
    辽宁省本溪市食品公司肉食加工厂在今年1月27日至2月2日的7天内，每天平均宰杀的20几头母牛中，宰后发现就有六、七头是孕牛。2月1日1天宰杀的45头母牛中就有32头是孕牛。这些牛都是这个厂自行收购的。
    宰杀孕牛的主要原因，一方面是收购人员不懂技术，对孕牛鉴别不清；另方面是有些工作人员忽视保护耕牛的政策，看到肥的牛不管是菜牛或是耕牛、孕牛，就大肆收购。
    为了遵守国务院“关于防止滥宰耕牛和保护发展耕牛的指示”，本溪市食品公司肉食加工厂除加强了对采购人员的政策教育外，并且组织两名兽医参加采购工作，鉴别孕牛、耕牛。如2月6日在兽医参加收购的14头牛中，不仅全是老口，而且没有一头孕牛。
