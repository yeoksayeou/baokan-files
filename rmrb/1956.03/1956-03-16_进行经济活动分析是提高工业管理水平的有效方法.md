Conducting Economic Activity Analysis is an Effective Method to Improve Industrial Management Level
Li Ping

In recent years, there has been considerable progress in China's industrial management level. However, it is undeniable that there are still many shortcomings in our management work, and one of the important ones is: not being good at analyzing the economic activities of the enterprises or units under our management, and not being good at checking the true situation of the enterprise's plan implementation through economic activity analysis, so as to find shortcomings and tap potential. The production or capital construction of our industry often conceals serious defects in individual enterprises, individual units, and individual aspects under the general average figures; under the general completion of the planned indicators, it conceals various defects in the plan itself and in the implementation of the plan; under the realization of one indicator, especially the output indicator, it ignores the major defects of other indicators that have not been completed; in the situation where the level of various technical and economic indicators has increased compared with the past, it ignores the backward situation existing in some important aspects.

Promoting economic activity analysis can help industrial leaders delve into economic work and effectively overcome these shortcomings.

Economic activity analysis is a leadership method that uses various economic and technical data and on-site production investigation and research to conduct systematic analysis and economic supervision of enterprise activities, and to conduct systematic inspections of the implementation of plans, in order to discover problems, correct shortcomings, and further mobilize human and material resources to better complete the plan. Specifically, it means:

(1) Not only should we check the output indicators, but also the implementation of indicators such as quality, variety (including new product trial production), labor and wage fund usage, machinery and equipment utilization, material supply and consumption, capital usage, etc., and analyze the true situation of various factors affecting labor productivity and cost composition.

(2) Not only should we conduct in-depth analysis of the situation of our own unit, but also compare and analyze with the advanced levels at home and abroad.

(3) Not only should we check achievements, but more importantly, we should expose shortcomings and discover problems. When checking achievements, we must specifically analyze the good methods and advanced experiences that have led to the achievements; when exposing shortcomings, we must deeply analyze the reasons for the formation of these shortcomings and the failure to unleash production potential.

(4) After inspection and analysis, we must propose the direction and technical and organizational measures to correct shortcomings and unleash production potential, and stipulate the responsibility system for implementing and checking these measures, and mobilize the masses to promote advanced experiences at home and abroad to realize them.

The period for conducting economic activity analysis can be one year, one quarter, one month, one ten-day period, or a specific period. It should be particularly noted that economic activity analysis must be carried out regularly and periodically and must become a fixed leadership system for industrial management.

Economic activity analysis can be used when ministries and bureaus check the implementation of a production plan, a problem, or the plan of an enterprise, or it can be used when an enterprise checks the implementation of its own plan or the work of a certain problem or unit.

Holding economic activity analysis meetings is an important way to conduct this analysis. However, before the meeting, we must first conduct multi-faceted comparative analysis of the accounting data and other data of the economic activities of the period to be inspected, and conduct in-depth, practical, and typical investigation and research among the masses. Only in this way can the meeting grasp scientific materials, have sufficient persuasiveness, and truly be successful without becoming a mere formality.

Here, we cite a few examples based on the materials of the Ministry of Heavy Industry.

Last year, the Ministry of Heavy Industry conducted an economic activity analysis of the blast furnace ironmaking production in the first half of the year. The blast furnace production in this half year was significantly improved compared with the same period in 1954. In 1954, the blast furnace utilization coefficient (the number of cubic meters of blast furnace volume occupied by each ton of molten iron per day and night) was 0.922; in the first half of 1955, it had been reduced to 0.877, and the output in the first half of 1955 increased by 21.8% compared with the same period in 1954, completing 101.7% of the plan. However, after analysis, it was found that 60% of the ironmaking plants in the country at that time had not completed the pig iron production plan; although the average blast furnace utilization coefficient was better than the previous year, one-quarter of the blast furnaces were worse than the previous year; if compared with the average advanced level of the previous year, then the utilization coefficient of half of the blast furnaces was regressing, and if this half could reach the same average advanced level of the other half in the previous year, then 64,000 tons of pig iron could be increased. Secondly, after analyzing the consumption of ore and coke, it was seen that the consumption of ore during this period was higher than the same period of the previous year (the average ore required per ton of pig iron in the whole year of 1954 was 1.702 tons, but in the first half of 1955 it increased to 1.713 tons); although the coke consumption was generally lower than the level of the previous year, there were also individual units that were higher than the previous year. Again, after analysis, it can be seen that about 40% of all blast furnaces reduced pig iron production by 25,000 tons due to the impact of furnace accretion accidents, and frequent power outages, water outages, and mechanical accidents also had a very bad impact on production. All of the above showed that the technical leadership and organizational leadership of the factories were weak. Thus, after economic activity analysis, it was discovered that under the general progress, serious defects were still concealed in many aspects. Taking concrete measures to overcome these shortcomings can greatly unleash production potential and further increase iron production.

The Ministry of Heavy Industry also conducted an economic activity analysis of open hearth steelmaking production from January to August 1955. During this period, the open hearth utilization coefficient (tons of steel production per square meter of furnace bottom area per day and night) had increased from 5.18 in the previous year to 5.867 (the planned target was 5.8), so the production during this period increased by 130,000 tons of steel compared with the same period last year. The increase in the open hearth utilization coefficient is composed of factors such as the calendar operation rate (i.e., the average smelting time per day), the smelting time per furnace, and the steel output per furnace. Among these, the amount of increase in production due to the increase in the calendar operation rate from 81% to 85.54% accounted for 60,000 tons of the 130,000 tons. The main reason for increasing the open hearth operation rate was the vigorous promotion of new furnace methods and the implementation of experience such as rapid cold repairs. Secondly, the amount of increase in production due to the shortening of smelting time per furnace accounted for 50,000 tons of the 130,000 tons. The important reasons for the shortening of smelting time per furnace are a series of improvements in the furnace body and auxiliary equipment, as well as improvements in operation and gas quality. Furthermore, the amount of increase in production due to the increase in steel output per furnace accounted for 20,000 tons of the 130,000 tons. The above shows that open hearth production has been greatly improved compared with the previous year. However, if we compare the factories, we can see that although there is no big difference in equipment among the same type of open hearths, the production capacity varies greatly. For example, the type and size of Angang's No. 9 open hearth are the same as those of No. 8 and No. 7 open hearths, but the utilization coefficients are 6.563, 6.706, and 5.891 respectively. And the utilization coefficients of the same type of open hearths in the factories of the Iron and Steel Bureau are even more different: for example, No. 2 furnace of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 is 7.726, No. 1 furnace of Tianjin Steel Plant is 6.886, while the highest in Taiyuan Steel Plant is only 4.812, the high of Chongqing Steel Plant is 6.031 and the low is only 4.203, and Daye Steel Plant is only 4.567. This shows that not all open hearths have reached the highest possible indicators. As long as the backward open hearths can overcome their shortcomings and adopt advanced experience in technology, operation, and management to reach the level of the utilization coefficient of the open hearths of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, then the country can increase production by 500,000 tons of steel in one year. In addition, in terms of raw material consumption, in the first half of 1955, the amount of metal material used per ton of open hearth steel in Angang was 41 kg more than the average consumption quota of the Soviet Union in 1955, and 58 kg more than the advanced enterprises of the Soviet Union, while the factories of the Iron and Steel Bureau used 61.2 kg more than the average consumption quota of the Soviet Union. Among the factories of the Iron and Steel Bureau, Tianjin Steel Plant used less, while Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 and Chongqing Steel Plant No. 1 used 42 and 40 kg more, respectively. If the factories of the Iron and Steel Bureau can reduce the consumption of metal materials to the level of Tianjin Steel Plant (not to mention reaching the level of the Soviet Union), then 7,500 tons of metal materials could have been saved in the first half of 1955.

In this way, through economic activity analysis, we can not only know the content of the achievements and the good experiences that have led to the achievements, but also expose the backward enterprises, units or aspects and the basic reasons for the backwardness, so that we can propose effective measures, promote the advanced experiences in China, and learn from the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union and other countries to greatly unleash the potential of China's industrial production.

Let's take another example of economic activity analysis for an enterprise. In the first half of 1955, the Ministry of Heavy Industry analyzed the various economic indicators of the Shenyang Chemical Plant. Judging from the surface statistics, the plant's completion of planned indicators in 1954 was: total output value 111%, total commodity value 103.4%, labor productivity 119%, actual cost reduced by 5.4% compared with the plan, capital turnover accelerated by 9 days compared with the plan, and profits turned over exceeded the plan by 40%, fully overfulfilling the state plan. However, comparing this plant with other enterprises of the same nature (although some conditions are not exactly the same), serious problems were found. For example, (1) from the perspective of current efficiency, the Shenyang plant is 3.7% lower than the Jinxi plant and the Dagu plant, and 6% lower than the Tianjin plant; (2) from the perspective of the amount of salt consumed for producing one ton of caustic soda, the Shenyang plant is 14% higher than the Jinxi plant, 12% higher than the Tianjin plant, and 7% higher than the Dagu plant; (3) from the perspective of alkali loss rate, the Shenyang plant is 4.4 times higher than the Jinxi plant, and 1.7 times higher than the Tianjin plant and the Dagu plant; (4) from the perspective of the amount of DC power consumed for producing one ton of alkali, the Shenyang plant is 12% higher than the Jinxi plant, 14% higher than the Tianjin plant, and 10% higher than the Dagu plant; (5) from the perspective of capital turnover period, the Shenyang plant is 52 days slower than the Jinxi plant, 37 days slower than the Tianjin plant, and 28 days slower than the Dagu plant; (6) from the perspective of production cost, the cost of solid alkali from January to September in the Shenyang plant was 50% higher than that of the Dagu plant, the cost of liquid alkali was 30% higher than that of the Dagu plant, 26% higher than that of the Tianjin plant, and the cost of bleaching powder was 30% higher than that of the Jinxi plant; (7) from the perspective of labor productivity, the Shenyang plant was 71% lower than the Dagu plant, 54% lower than the Jinxi plant, and 50% lower than the Tianjin plant. It is clear from the economic activity analysis that the Shenyang Chemical Plant at that time was not only not an advanced plant, but on the contrary, it was a backward plant. If the plant could reach the indicators of other plants, then it could produce 800 tons more caustic soda, create 780,000 yuan more profit, and save 2.66 million yuan of circulating capital in one year. At the same time, the inspection also found some serious problems in their work: (1) they adopted very wrong capitalist business methods, such as selling goods to the outside even after all the products of the factory were sold out, in order to superficially accelerate the capital turnover; giving good samples to substandard goods; deliberately allowing unqualified products to leave the factory, etc.; (2) they adopted false methods to the state, such as deliberately squeezing the expenses that should have been amortized in the previous year into the next year, and deliberately writing off the materials abandoned due to their own mismanagement and the abandoned parts of enemy and puppet materials together; (3) there were serious waste phenomena, such as the problem of alkali leakage and gas leakage has not been solved for a long time, resulting in losses of more than hundreds of thousands of yuan over the years; more than 10,000 hydrochloric acid jars were broken in 1954 alone. The root cause of these problems and shortcomings was that the leaders of the plant were arrogant and complacent. Because they had made some achievements in their work, they began to regard themselves as advanced, carried burdens, and were unwilling to humbly learn from advanced experience. They lost sensitivity to new things. They were intoxicated with the superficial figures of "comprehensively overfulfilling" and ignored the serious problems in their work, resulting in the Shenyang plant becoming a backward enterprise at that time. At the economic activity analysis meeting held by the Chemical Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, these serious problems and shortcomings of the Shenyang plant were exposed, which made the leaders of the plant begin to wake up and made self-criticism. Comrades from other factories also criticized and helped the Shenyang plant. After this economic activity analysis meeting, the plant took positive measures to address its problems and shortcomings, and its work began to improve. The indicators in 1955 were greatly improved compared with the previous year. In the second half of 1955, the Ministry of Heavy Industry again analyzed the economic activities of the plant, pointed out some of their progress, and also pointed out the shortcomings that they needed to continue to overcome, and proposed further measures to improve their work in response to these shortcomings. In this way, economic activity analysis helped the plant gradually get rid of its backward state.

In the above-mentioned economic activity analysis materials of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, there is not much analysis on increasing varieties, and there is relatively little analysis on how to improve quality. However, increasing varieties, improving quality, saving raw materials, and reducing costs are extremely important issues for improving China's current industrial level. We hope that more attention can be paid to this in economic activity analysis.

From the above examples, we can see that implementing economic activity analysis can:

(1) Effectively overcome conservative thinking and complacency, and can carry out practical and effective criticism and self-criticism based on reliable and practical materials. The reason why some leaders of our industrial management agencies and enterprises are prone to conservative and complacent emotions is mainly because they do not have a clear understanding of the true situation of their own work, and do not strictly measure their work with the world's advanced level, the country's advanced level, and the high requirements of the country and the people. After economic activity analysis, they can clearly see the shortcomings that should be overcome, so as to take effective measures to catch up. The above example of the Shenyang Chemical Plant is enough to illustrate this point.

(2) Through economic activity analysis, many untapped production potentials in enterprises can be unearthed. Some of our enterprises believe that they have already produced to the top and that the potential has been fully tapped. In fact, this is not the case at all. China's socialist enterprises have various superior conditions and have great production potential. As long as our leaders can always face up to shortcomings, analyze in depth, and timely overcome the weak links in production, then the production potential can be fully unleashed. The above example clearly illustrates this point. This is the case in the steel sector, and it is the case in all production sectors and economic sectors across the country.

(3) Through economic activity analysis, we can not only discover production potential, but also discover advanced units, advanced people, and advanced experiences. Therefore, we can not only see that there is potential to be unleashed, but also find effective ways to unleash this potential. We can formulate strong technical and organizational measures in response to the problems discovered in the analysis, launch a socialist labor competition among the masses, and promote effective advanced experiences to effectively improve production.

(4) Economic activity analysis is a practical method to improve the management level of cadres. Many cadres engaged in industrial work still lack knowledge and experience. On the one hand, our cadres need to intensify their study of professional knowledge and culture to improve themselves, and on the other hand, they need to improve themselves through research in practical work. Economic activity analysis is an effective method in this regard. There is a lot of work in industrial management. How can leaders keep a clear mind in the midst of busyness, pay attention to new things in practice, and use advanced new technologies and new experiences? To do this, we need to use the method of economic activity analysis to conduct specific and in-depth research, comparison, analysis, and synthesis to discover what is advanced and correct, what is backward and incorrect, what we should promote, and what we should overcome. In this way, we can improve the professional knowledge level of cadres on the basis of evidence, and improve the management level of enterprises purposefully.

Economic activity analysis is an advanced Soviet experience. In places where it has been adopted in China, it has also proved to be an effective method to improve China's industrial management. This method is not only of great use to the administrative organization of enterprises, but also a practical method for the party organization in enterprises to deepen political and ideological leadership and further combine political work and economic work. This method is not only very useful in industrial management, but also useful for other economic sectors (although the problems in the work are different).

Comrade Mao Zedong has long instructed us: "Many of our comrades lack the mind for analysis. They are unwilling to make repeated and in-depth analysis and research on complex things, but prefer to make simple conclusions of absolute affirmation or absolute negation." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol. 3, p. 943) Comrade Mao Zedong emphasized Lenin's words that concrete analysis of concrete conditions is "the most essential thing in Marxism, the living soul of Marxism" (ibid.). Economic activity analysis can be said to be an example of the application of this Marxist-Leninist method in industrial management. The economic activity analysis method has not been adopted much in industrial management agencies and enterprises in China, and in other economic institutions. It is hoped that this advanced method can be promoted in a planned and step-by-step manner and popularized to every enterprise and every economic institution, so as to greatly improve our industrial level and complete our country's great socialist construction plan more, faster, better, and more economically.

    进行经济活动分析是提高工业管理水平的有效方法
    黎平
    我国的工业管理水平，近年来是有不少进步的。可是，不可否认，我们管理工作中存在的缺点还不少，其中重要的一个就是：不善于分析自己所管企业或单位的经济活动，不善于通过经济活动分析去检查企业执行计划的真实情况，从中发现缺点，挖掘潜力。我们工业的生产或基本建设，常常在一般的平均数字下面，掩盖了个别企业、个别单位和个别方面的严重缺陷；在一般地完成计划指标的下面，掩盖了计划本身以及执行计划上面的各种缺陷；在实现一种指标特别是产量指标的下面，漠视了其它指标没有完成的重大缺陷；在各项技术经济指标的水平同过去对比起来有了增长的情况下面，漠视了存在于一些重要方面的落后状况。
    推行经济活动分析，可以帮助工业领导者深入经济工作，有效地克服这些缺点。
    经济活动分析是运用各种经济、技术资料以及生产现场的调查研究，对企业活动进行系统的分析和经济监督，对计划的执行情形进行系统的检查，借以发现问题，纠正缺点，进一步动员人力物力来更好地完成计划的一种领导方法。具体地说，就是：
    （一）不仅要检查产量指标，而且要检查质量、品种（包括新产品试制）、劳动力和工资基金的使用、机械设备的利用、材料的供应和消耗、资金的使用等等指标的执行情况，分析出影响劳动生产率和组成成本的各种因素的真实情况。
    （二）不仅要就本单位的情况进行深入的分析，而且必须同国内的和国外的先进水平进行比较和分析。
    （三）不仅要检查成绩，而且更重要的是要揭露缺点，发现问题。在检查成绩的时候，必须具体分析所以获得成绩的良好方法和先进经验；在揭露缺点的时候，必须深入分析所以形成这种缺点、使得生产潜力不能发挥的原因。
    （四）在检查分析以后，必须提出改正缺点、发挥生产潜力的方向和技术组织措施，并且规定执行和检查这些措施的责任制度，发动广大群众推行国内外先进经验，来予以实现。
    进行经济活动分析的期间，可以是一年的，一季的，一月的，一旬的，或者是一个特定时期的。应当特别注意，经济活动分析必须经常地定期地进行，必须成为工业管理的一种固定的领导制度。
    经济活动分析，可以在部、局检查一种生产、一个问题或一个企业的计划执行情况的时候运用，也可以在一个企业检查本身计划执行情况或一定问题、单位的工作情况的时候应用。
    举行经济活动分析会议是进行这种分析的一个重要方式。但是在开会以前，必须先对所要检查的这一时期经济活动的计算资料和其他资料进行多方面的对比分析，并且进行深入实际、深入群众的典型的调查研究。这样才能使会议掌握有科学的材料，具有充分的说服力，真正开得好而不至流于形式。
    这里我们根据重工业部的材料，举出几个例子。
    重工业部去年曾对上半年的高炉炼铁生产进行了经济活动分析。这半年的高炉生产，比1954年同期有显著进步。1954年高炉利用系数（每昼夜每吨铁水所占用的高炉容积的立方公尺数）是0.922；1955年上半年已经降低到0.877，1955年上半年产量和1954年同期比较增加了21.8％，完成了计划的101.7％。可是，在进行分析以后，就发现了：当时全国炼铁厂中，有60％没有完成生铁产量计划；虽然高炉利用系数平均比上一年为好，但是有四分之一的高炉反而不如上一年；如果和上一年平均先进水平比较，那么，有一半高炉的利用系数是退步了，如果能使这一半和其它一半同样达到上一年的平均先进水平，那么就可以增产64，000吨生铁。其次，分析矿石和焦炭的消耗情况后，看到这一期间矿石的消耗比上一年同期是提高了（1954年全年平均每吨生铁需用的矿石为1.702吨，到1955年上半年反增加到1.713吨）；焦炭的消耗虽然一般的比较上一年的水平降低，但是也有个别单位比较上一年反而提高了。再次，经过分析，更可以看到全部高炉中约有40％由于炉瘤事故的影响，减少生铁产量25，000吨，而频繁的停电、停水和机械事故也对生产起了很不好的影响。所有上述这些都表现出工厂的技术领导和组织领导是薄弱的。这样，经过经济活动分析之后，就发现在一般的进步下面，好些方面还掩盖着严重的缺点。针对这些问题，采取具体措施，努力克服缺点，就可以大大发挥生产潜力，使铁的生产进一步提高。
    重工业部对1955年1至8月的平炉炼钢生产也进行了经济活动分析。这一时期平炉利用系数（每昼夜每平方公尺炉底面积的钢产量吨数）已经从上一年的5.18提高到5.867（计划指标是5.8），因此这一时期比上年同期增产13万吨钢。平炉利用系数的提高是由日历作业率（即每天平均冶炼时间）每炉熔炼时间和每炉出钢量诸因素组成的。在这中间，由于日历作业率由81％提高到85.54％而增产的数量，在13万吨中占6万吨。提高平炉作业率的主要原因是大力推广新炼炉法和推行快速冷修等经验。其次，由于每炉熔炼时间缩短而增产的数量在13万吨中占5万吨。每炉熔炼时间缩短的重要原因，是炉体和附属设备上的一系列的改进以及操作上和煤气质量上的改进。再其次，由于每炉钢产量加多而增产的数量在13万吨中占两万吨。上述这些显示出平炉生产比较前一年有了很大的改进。可是，如果拿各厂来比较，就可以看出同类型的平炉虽然在设备上并无很大差别，但是生产能力则相差很多。如鞍钢九号平炉同八号七号平炉的类型、大小都相同，但是利用系数则各为6.563、6.706、5.891。而钢铁局各厂同类型平炉的利用系数则相差更远：如上钢一厂二号炉为7.726，天津钢厂一号炉为6.886，而太原钢厂最高的也只有4.812，重庆钢厂则高的为6.031、低的只4.203，大冶钢厂也只4.567。这说明并不是所有平炉都已经达到可能达到的较高指标，只要落后的平炉能够克服缺点，在技术上、操作上、管理上采用先进经验，达到上钢一厂平炉利用系数的水平，那么全国就可以在一年内增产50万吨钢。此外，在原料的消耗方面，1955年上半年每吨平炉钢所用金属料，鞍钢比苏联1955年平均消耗定额多41公斤，比苏联先进企业多58公斤，钢铁局各厂则比苏联平均消耗定额多61.2公斤。在钢铁局各厂中用得较少的为天津钢厂，而上钢一厂、重庆一厂则较之各多用了42、40公斤。如果钢铁局各厂能使金属料的消耗量达到天津钢厂的水平（更不用说达到苏联的水平），那么1955年上半年就能节约金属料7，500吨。
    这样，经过经济活动分析，我们不仅可以知道成绩的内容和所以取得成绩的良好经验，而且也可以暴露出落后的企业、单位或方面和落后的基本原因，从而也就可以提出有效措施，推行国内的先进经验，学习苏联和其他国家的先进经验，来大大地发挥我国工业生产的潜力。
    再举对于一个企业的经济活动分析为例。重工业部在1955年上半年对沈阳化工厂的各项经济指标进行了分析。从表面的统计数字去看，这个厂1954年完成计划指标的情况是：生产总值111％，商品总值103.4％，劳动生产率119％，实际成本比计划降低了5.4％，资金周转比计划加快了9天，上缴利润超过了计划40％，全面超额完成了国家计划。但是，拿这个厂和其它几个性质相同的企业（虽然有些条件不完全相同）来比较，那么，就发现了严重的问题。例如，（一）从电流的效率来看，沈阳厂比锦西厂、大沽厂低3.7％，比天津厂低6％；（二）从生产一吨火碱所消耗的盐的数量来看，沈阳厂比锦西厂高14％，比天津厂高12％，比大沽厂高7％；（三）从碱的损失率看，沈阳厂比锦西厂高四点四倍，比天津厂、大沽厂高一点七倍；（四）从生产一吨碱所消耗的直流电量看，沈阳厂比锦西厂高12％，比天津厂高14％，比大沽厂高10％；（五）从资金周转期来看，沈阳厂比锦西厂慢52天，比天津厂慢37天，比大沽厂慢28天；（六）从生产成本来看，1至9月份固体碱的成本，沈阳厂比大沽厂高50％，液体碱成本比大沽厂高30％，比天津厂高26％，漂白粉成本比锦西厂高30％；（七）从劳动生产率来看，沈阳厂比大沽厂低71％，比锦西厂低54％，比天津厂低50％。从经济活动分析中清楚地看到，那时候的沈阳化工厂，不仅不是一个先进的厂，相反地却是一个落后的厂。如果该厂能够达到其它厂的指标，那么，一年就可以多生产800吨火碱，多创造78万元的利润，节约周转资金266万元。同时，检查中更发现了他们工作上这样一些严重毛病：（一）他们采取了非常错误的资本主义经营方式，如为了在表面上加速资金周转，竟然在本厂产品全部卖完后，还向外售货，以套取资金；交好样品给次货；故意让不合格的产品出厂等；（二）对国家采取虚假的办法，如把上一年应摊的费用故意挤到下一年，故意把由于自己管理不善而废弃的物资和敌伪物资的报废部分一同报废；（三）有严重的浪费现象，如跑碱、跑气长期不解决，几年来损失几十万元以上；1954年一年打碎的盐酸坛子就有1万个以上。而这些毛病和缺点产生的根本原因，是在于该厂领导人骄傲自满，他们由于自己工作有了一点成绩，就开始以先进自居，背了包袱，不肯虚心学习先进经验，对新鲜事物失去敏感，他们陶醉于“全面超额完成”的表面数字，而漠视自己工作上的严重毛病，结果就使得沈阳厂在那时成了一个落后的企业。重工业部化学工业管理局召开的经济活动分析会议上，揭露了沈阳厂的这些严重毛病和缺点，使得该厂的领导人的头脑开始清醒起来，进行了检讨。其它厂的同志也都对沈阳厂进行了批评和帮助。在这次经济活动分析会议之后，该厂针对自己的毛病和缺点，采取了积极的措施，工作开始好转，1955年的指标就比前一年有了很大进步。1955年下半年，重工业部又对该厂的经济活动进行了分析，指出了他们的一些进步，同时也指出了他们所需要继续克服的缺点，并且针对这些缺点提出了进一步改善工作的措施。这样，通过经济活动分析就帮助该厂逐步摆脱了落后的状态。
    在上述重工业部的经济活动分析材料中，关于增加品种的分析，还见得不多，对于如何提高质量的分析看到的也比较少，而增加品种、提高质量、节约原材料、降低成本这样一些问题，正是我国当前工业水平提高上异常重要的问题。我们希望在经济活动分析中能予以更多的注意。
    从上述的实例中，我们看到，实行经济活动分析可以：
      （一）有力地克服保守思想和自满情绪，可以根据可靠的实际材料开展切实有效的批评和自我批评。我们某些工业管理机关和企业的领导者之所以容易产生保守自满情绪，主要的是由于他们没有清醒地认识本身工作的真实情况，没有以世界的先进水平、全国的先进水平和国家、人民高度的要求来严格衡量自己的工作。而经过经济活动分析，他们就可以清楚看到所应该克服的缺点，从而采取有效措施迎头赶上。上述沈阳化工厂的例子，就足以说明这一点。
      （二）通过经济活动分析可以挖掘出企业里的许多尚未运用的生产潜力。我们有些企业认为本身已经生产到顶，潜力已经挖完。事实上根本不是如此。我国的社会主义性质的企业具有各种优越条件，有巨大的生产潜力。只要我们的领导者能够经常正视缺点，深入分析，并且及时克服生产中的薄弱环节，那末生产潜力是完全可以发挥出来的。上面的例子清楚地说明了这一点。钢铁部门是这样，全国一切生产部门、经济部门都是这样。
      （三）通过经济活动分析，我们不仅能够发现生产潜力，而且更可以发现先进单位、先进人物和先进经验，因而我们不仅可以看到有潜力可以发挥，而且可以找到发挥这些潜力的有效方法。我们可以针对分析所发现的问题，确定有力的技术组织措施，发动广大群众的社会主义劳动竞赛，推行行之有效的先进经验，以切实提高生产。
      （四）经济活动分析是提高干部管理水平的一个切实方法。许多从事工业工作的干部，知识还是不足的，经验还是不够的。我们干部一方面需要加紧学习专业知识和文化来提高自己，同时又需要通过实际工作的研究来提高自己。经济活动分析正是这方面的有效方法。工业管理中的工作很多，领导人员如何能在繁忙中间保持清醒的头脑，去注视实践中的新事物，运用先进的新技术新经验呢？要做到这点，就需要采用经济活动分析的方法，进行具体深入的研究、对比、分析、综合，发现什么是先进的和正确的，什么是落后的和不正确的，什么是我们应该推广的东西，什么是我们所要克服的东西。这样，我们就能够有根据地提高干部的业务知识水平，有目的地提高企业的管理水平。
    经济活动分析是苏联的先进经验，在我国已经采用的地方，也表现出是改善我国工业管理的一个行之有效的方法。这一方法，不仅对于企业的行政组织有很大作用，而且对于企业中党的组织来说，也是深入政治思想领导、进一步结合政治工作和经济工作的一个切实的方法。这一方法不仅在工业管理上很有作用，而且对于其它经济部门（虽然工作中的问题有所不同）也同样是有用的。
    毛泽东同志早就指示过我们：“我们许多同志缺乏分析的头脑，对于复杂事物，不愿作反复深入的分析研究，而爱作绝对肯定或绝对否定的简单结论。”（毛泽东选集三卷943页）毛泽东同志强调地指出了列宁的话，对于具体情况作具体的分析，是“马克思主义的最本质的东西、马克思主义的活的灵魂”（同上）。经济活动分析，可以说也就是这种马克思列宁主义的方法在工业管理上应用的一个实例。经济活动分析方法在我国工业管理机关和企业中，在其它经济机构中，采用得还不多。希望这个先进方法，能够有计划、有步骤地被推行开来，普及到每一企业、每一经济机关中去，以大大地提高我们的工业水平，又多、又快、又好、又省地完成我国的伟大的社会主义建设计划。
