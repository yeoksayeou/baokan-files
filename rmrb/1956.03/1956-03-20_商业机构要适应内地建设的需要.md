    Commercial Institutions Must Adapt to the Needs of Inland Construction
    Liu Zhiqing
    From 1953 to 1955, the population of Luoyang City increased by more than 100,000 people (excluding the increase in suburban areas). Among the newly added population, the majority were workers and technicians, with generally higher purchasing power. During this period, the commercial institutions in Luoyang City did not increase accordingly, and the supply of many industries, especially service industries, fell far short of demand. The whole city only had three small bathhouses, which could only accommodate 200 people. The largest of these could only accommodate 70 people, while more than 1,000 people patronized it every day. Customers had to wait one or two hours from queuing to buy a ticket to taking a bath. Due to the large number of bathers and the outdated equipment (using large pots to heat water), the sanitary conditions were poor, and a layer of one-finger-thick grime often floated on the water, which people had to push aside with their hands to take a bath. Workers living in the suburbs only had time to take a bath on Sundays; many people didn't take a bath even once a month. The city had added eight restaurants in the past two years, which was far from meeting the demand. In the western industrial area, there was only one enterprise canteen. After work, 400 to 500 workers often queued up, but the canteen could only accommodate about 150 people, so it took about two hours to eat a meal. Clothing stores were also generally overwhelmed, with poor skills and high prices. Customers had to pay 1.7 yuan to make a set of blue uniform (pork and vegetables were half the price of Beijing, while clothing processing fees were only 10% lower), and had to wait a month to wear it. There were also too few barbers, and many residents didn't want to queue up, so they didn't get a haircut even once a month. Because these industries were doing particularly well, the income of general capitalists and workers was high. Some bathhouse workers earned 110 yuan a month, and barber workers earned more than 80 yuan, far exceeding the average wage level of industrial workers, which was very unreasonable.
    In order to meet the needs of citizens, especially workers, the Luoyang Municipal People's Committee signed an agreement with the Shanghai Second Commercial Bureau and some Shanghai private merchants in September last year to transfer personnel. The specific method was for Luoyang City to send people to Shanghai to select suitable private shops, and then consult with the labor and management of the shop to move the entire business to Luoyang. The Shanghai Second Commercial Bureau was responsible for organizing their relocation; the private merchants were responsible for moving all personnel and assets, and paid their own travel expenses; Luoyang City was responsible for arranging housing. After all parties agreed, it was decided to transfer a clothing store with 50 people, a laundry and dyeing shop with 45 people, a barber shop with 35 people, a restaurant with 30 people, and a photography studio with 30 people, totaling 190 people. In addition, 130 employees of private wholesale businesses in Shanghai were transferred, bringing 380,000 yuan of working capital and 170,000 yuan of government bonds to invest in the service industry in Luoyang City.
    In early December, all five stores from Shanghai moved to Luoyang. Because the housing had been arranged, the barber, photography, laundry and dyeing, and clothing stores prepared for three to five days, and after being approved for joint state-private operation, they opened with their old names. The restaurant initially did not set up a separate store, but distributed the employees to several state-owned canteens. Later, because of opinions from all parties, the original team was concentrated and two Shanghai restaurants were set up separately. The private wholesalers used the funds they brought to build a hotel and two bathhouses, and construction has already begun. The 130 wholesale personnel are temporarily working as temporary employees in various state-owned professional companies, and will be transferred to work after the new hotel and bathhouses are completed.
    Since the opening of these service stores, the benefits of moving entire shops have been demonstrated. First of all, the residents of Luoyang are very satisfied. Many Shanghai workers and technicians in the city saw that the well-known Wan's Photography Studio in Shanghai had moved in, and they rushed to take pictures. On the opening day, 47 people went to take pictures, and since then, 20 to 30 people have been waiting to take pictures every day. The price of this photography studio is 30% lower than that of local shops, which has led to the existing ten photography studios also lowering their prices (still with a profit of 65%). In the past, many people wanted to make beautifully styled clothes but couldn't find a good clothing store; now that the Shanghai Guotai Clothing Store has arrived, they are rushing to make new clothes. This clothing store has good craftsmanship and the price is 17% lower than that of local shops. The Shanghai barber shop has complete and clean equipment, and the technique is good and fast (it takes 30 minutes for a haircut, while local shops take 50 minutes), so many people like to go there for haircuts and blow-dries. Originally, there were no laundry and dyeing shops in the city for high-grade clothing, but now there is.
    Secondly, the employees of the relocated stores are very satisfied. Among the four stores that have opened, except for the laundry and dyeing business which is average (because there is less demand for high-grade laundry and dyeing in the city, and more demand from workers in the industrial area, but because of the distance, they can only come to the city to pick up clothes every fourteen days. Now they are preparing to set up temporary stations in the industrial area, and it is estimated that the business will increase), the other three businesses are very prosperous. Guotai Clothing Store has already taken orders 40 days in advance. The turnover of Wan's Photography Studio has doubled compared to when it was in Shanghai. The income of barber shop workers will also double compared to when they were in Shanghai. When the Luoyang Municipal Commercial Bureau asked for the opinions of the Shanghai shop assistants, the shop assistants said: There are three good things about coming to Luoyang: First, the salary is good; second, we feel good seeing the industrial construction; third, the government takes good care of us.
    Finally, the relevant departments in Shanghai and Luoyang are very satisfied. Shanghai sent more than 200 commercial employees to Luoyang, arranged their work and life, and solved their difficulties. Luoyang felt that the shops moved from Shanghai were very suitable for the needs of the people, and also helped to lower market prices and rapidly improved the management level of the service industry. The industrial area and administrative area of Luoyang City have long needed bathhouses and hotels, and now someone has invested in them, which will bring great convenience to the people. Therefore, they believe that moving entire shops from Shanghai is a very good method, and they are considering transferring another batch from Shanghai.

    商业机构要适应内地建设的需要
    刘志庆
    从1953年到1955年，洛阳市增加了十多万人（郊区增加的不计在内）。在新增加的人口中，大部分是工人和技术人员，购买力一般较高。在这期间，洛阳市商业机构却没有相应增加，许多行业，特别是服务性的行业供不应求的情况很严重。全市只有三家小浴池，只能容纳二百人。其中最大的一家只能容七十人，而每天上座的有一千人以上。顾客从排队买牌到洗澡需要等候一、二个小时。由于洗澡人多、设备落后（用大锅烧水），卫生条件又坏，水上经常浮有一指厚的灰泥，人们用手拨开才能洗澡。住在郊区的职工，只有星期日才有时间洗澡；许多人一个月也不洗上一次。全市两年来增加了八个饭馆，还远远满足不了需要。在城西的工区只有一个企业性的食堂，工人下班以后，经常有四、五百人去排队，食堂只能容纳一百五十人左右，吃一顿饭就得两个小时左右。服装店也普遍忙不过来，技术又低，价钱又高。顾客做一身蓝布制服要一元七角（猪肉和蔬菜比北京便宜一半，而服装加工费只低10％），还要等一个月才能穿上。理发员也太少，许多居民不愿去排队，就一个月也不理一次发。因为这些行业生意特别好，一般资本家和工人的收入很多。有的澡堂工人每月收入110元，理发工人收入八十多元，大大超过了产业工人的平均工资水平，这是很不合理的事情。
    洛阳市人民委员会为了满足市民，特别是工人们的需要，去年九月份，就同上海市第二商业局以及一部分上海私商签订了调配人员的协议。具体办法是由洛阳市派人到上海选择合意的私营店铺，然后和该店的劳资双方共同协商，全摊搬到洛阳。上海市第二商业局负责组织他们搬家；私商负责搬走全部人员和资产，并且自出路费；洛阳市负责安排房舍。经各方同意以后，确定调配成衣店一家五十人，洗染店一家四十五人，理发店一家三十五人，饭馆一家三十人，照像馆一家三十人，共一百九十人。此外，还调配上海的私营批发业从业人员一百三十人，并且带流动资金三十八万元和公债十七万元，向洛阳市的服务业投资。
    十二月上旬，上海市五家商店全部搬到了洛阳。因为房舍已经安排妥当，理发、照像、洗染、服装四户筹备三、五天，被批准公私合营以后，就用旧字号开业了。饭馆起初没有单独设店，而把从业人员分配到了几个国营食堂，后来因为各方有意见，又集中了原班人马分设了两个上海馆。私营批发商用带来的资金修建一个旅馆和两个浴池，已经着手筹建。130位批发人员暂时在各国营专业公司做临时雇员，待新建的旅馆和浴池落成以后再调去工作。
    自从这批服务商店开业以来，已经表现了店铺全套搬家的好处。首先是洛阳居民很满意。市内许多上海工人和技术人员看到上海较有名的万氏照像馆搬来了，就纷纷跑去照像。开业那一天就有47人去照像，以后每天也有二、三十人等候照像。这家照像馆的价格比当地铺子低30％，从而使原有的十家照像馆也随着降低了价格（仍有利润65％）。过去，许多人想做样式美观的服装，找不到好服装店；这回上海国泰服装店来了，都争先恐后地去做新衣。这个服装店工艺好，价格又比当地铺子低17％。上海理发店设备齐全整洁，技术又好又快（理一次发用三十分钟，当地店要50分钟），很多人喜欢去理发和吹风。原来全市没有洗染高级料服装的洗染店，现在也有了。
    其次是迁来店铺的职工很满意。在开业的四家中，除了洗染业营业平常外（因市内需要高级洗染较少，工区职工需要多，但是因路远，每隔十四天才能进城取衣服。现在已经准备由洗染店到工区去设临时站，估计营业会上升），其余三家营业都非常兴旺。国泰服装店目前已经接了40天以后的定活。万氏照像馆营业额比在上海时增加了一倍。理发店工人的收入，比在上海的时候也将增加一倍。洛阳市商业局征求上海店员的意见的时候，店员们说：来到洛阳有三好：一是工资好；二是看到工业建设情绪好；三是政府照顾我们好。
    再次是上海和洛阳的主管部门很满意。上海市把200多个商业从业人员送到洛阳，安置了他们的工作和生活，解决了他们的困难。洛阳市感到上海迁来的店铺很适合人民的需要，而且帮助拉低了市场价格并且迅速提高了服务业的经营水平。洛阳市工区和行政区早就需要浴池和旅馆，现在有人投资了，将给人民带来很大便利。所以他们认为从上海整套搬店是一种很好的办法，正考虑再向上海调一批来。
