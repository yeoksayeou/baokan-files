    Soviet Women Strive to Implement Resolutions of the Party Congress
    By Our Correspondent in Moscow Li He
    Soviet women, together with all the Soviet people, are engaged in fervent work to realize the great plan set forth by the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    The socialist competition initiated by Maria Rozhneva, female deputy foreman of the Moscow Kubavensine Factory, to enrich working hours and increase machine speeds, has been supported and promoted by the Central Committee of the Trade Union of the Soviet Consumer Goods Industry. Workers in enterprises such as the Moscow Shcherbakov Textile Factory and the "Paris Commune" Shoe Factory have actively participated in this competition. Rozhneva was previously a young female spinner. During the Fourth Five-Year Plan, this young female worker initiated a competition to save raw materials; during the Fifth Five-Year Plan, she initiated a competition to utilize all production potential at every work position. Now, after returning from the Party Congress, this Stalin Prize winner has immediately launched another competition of significant importance to improving labor productivity.

    After returning from the Party Congress, Stepanida Vishtak, female head of the production team of the Loshekin Collective Farm in the Grebenkovsky District of the Kiev Oblast, organized all team members to tap potential and decided to harvest 62,000 kilograms of sugar beets per hectare and 12,000 kilograms of corn per hectare this year. This female collective farmer, who has twice been awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor, then conveyed the results of the Party Congress to the collective farmers' congress in the village of Shariwanka in her district. Encouraged by her, the collective farmers of the whole village calculated all possibilities and passed a resolution to complete all tasks of the Sixth Five-Year Plan within three years. They guaranteed to reach the planned 1960 level as early as 1958: harvesting 2,000 kilograms of grain per hectare and 27,500 kilograms of sugar beets per hectare. They aim to increase labor productivity by half.

    Under the guidance of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Soviet women have become a tremendous force in the Soviet Union's communist construction. The socialist system places Soviet women in a position of equal importance to men, and the socialist system has opened up infinitely broad space for Soviet women to freely unleash their creativity.

    In many sectors of the Soviet national economy and scientific culture, we see the outstanding labor of women. There are women in the air force, geological exploration teams, and atomic power plants. The proportion of Soviet women's labor in social production is increasing. In 1940, women accounted for 38.4% of all employees in the national economy; now, they account for about 50% in industry. Women account for 76% of all doctors, 70% of teachers, nearly one-third of engineers and technicians, and 40% of agricultural specialists. There are 81,590 female scientific workers, of whom 9,796 have academic degrees. The works of some Soviet female scientists and writers are well-known outside the Soviet Union.

    Women widely participate in Soviet social work and state administration. Women participate in Soviets at all levels. Among the deputies of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, women account for 348, there are more than 2,000 in the Soviets of the Union Republics and Autonomous Republics, and more than 500,000 in the local Soviets.

    The increase in the political activity of Soviet women is most clearly reflected in the growth of the proportion of female party members in the ranks of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union now has 7,215,505 members, of whom 1,414,456 are women, 95,488 more than in 1952 and 1,080,635 more than in 1939. Female representatives accounted for 14.2% at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    The Communist Party and the state of the Soviet Union show meticulous concern for women. The aforementioned Vishtak said at the village congress: "The Party, like a dear mother, cares for our children and cares about the construction of schools, childcare facilities, and medical institutions." Soviet Minister of Health Kovrigina made two important suggestions at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union regarding further improving the lives of women. The first point is to extend maternity leave from 77 days to 112 days. The second point is to start from 1956 to shorten the working day for pregnant women and mothers with children under the age of 7 by two hours, or to have two days off per week, with full pay. Kovrigina's suggestions were met with warm applause at the congress.

    Women selflessly and actively participate in social labor and political activities. Society and the state provide better material security for women who shoulder the dual tasks of social labor and raising future generations. This is another sign of the superiority of the socialist system.

    苏联妇女努力实现党代表大会的决议
    本报驻莫斯科记者  李何
    苏联妇女和全体苏联人民一起，展开沸腾的工作，来实现苏联共产党第二十次代表大会所规定的伟大计划。
    莫斯科库巴汶细呢厂女副工长玛丽亚·罗日聂娃发起的充实工作时间和提高机器速度的社会主义竞赛，已经受到苏联日用品工业工会中央委员会的支持和推广。莫斯科谢尔巴科夫纺织厂、“巴黎公社”制鞋厂等等企业的职工都踊跃地参加了这个竞赛。罗日聂娃不久前还是纺纱女工。这位青年女工在第四个五年计划期间发起了节约原材料的竞赛，在第五个五年计划期间发起了在每一个工作位置利用一切生产潜力的竞赛。而现在，这位斯大林奖金获得者参加党代表大会回来以后立即发起了又一个对于提高劳动生产率有重要意义的竞赛。
    基辅州格列边科夫斯基区洛舍金集体农庄生产组女组长斯捷潘尼达·维什塔克参加党代表大会回去以后，组织全组庄员发掘潜力，决定今年从每公顷甜菜地上收62，000公斤甜菜，要从每公顷地上收12，000公斤玉米。这位二次荣获社会主义劳动英雄称号的女集体农民接着向本区沙里汪卡村集体农民大会传达了党代表大会结果。在她的鼓励下，全村集体农民计算了一切可能，通过了在三年内完成第六个五年计划的一切任务的决议。他们保证在1958年就达到计划规定的1960年的水平：每公顷种植谷物的土地收获2，000公斤，种植甜菜的土地收获27，500公斤。他们要提高劳动生产率半倍。
    在苏联共产党的指引下，苏联妇女成为苏联共产主义建设中的巨大力量。社会主义制度使苏联妇女处在和男子同样重要的地位，社会主义制度为苏联妇女开辟了自由发挥创造力的无限广阔的天地。
    在苏联国民经济和科学文化的许多部门，我们都看到了妇女的出色劳动。在航空队、地质勘探队、原子能发电站里都有妇女。苏联妇女在社会生产中的劳动比重日益增长着。在1940年时，妇女占国民经济全部职工的38.4％，现在在工业中就占约50％。妇女占全部医生的76％，教员的70％，工程师和技师的近三分之一，农业专门人材的40％。女科学工作者有81，590人，其中9，796人是有学位的。一些苏联女科学家、作家的著作在苏联国外都很著名。
    在苏联的社会工作和国家管理中，都有妇女广泛参加。妇女参加各级苏维埃机构。在苏联最高苏维埃代表当中妇女占348人，在各加盟共和国和自治共和国的苏维埃代表当中有2，000多人，在地方苏维埃代表当中占有50多万人。
    苏联妇女的政治积极性的提高，最清楚地反映在苏联共产党队伍中女党员比重的增长上。现在苏联共产党拥有7，215，505名党员，其中1，414，456名是妇女，比1952年多95，488名，比1939年多1，080，635名。在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会上女代表占14.2％。
    苏联共产党和国家对妇女的关怀是无微不至的。上面说的维什塔克在全村大会上说：“党像亲爱的母亲一样，关心我们的儿童，关心学校、幼儿机关和医疗机关的建设。”苏联卫生部长科夫里基娜在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会上的发言中提出了两点有关进一步改善妇女生活的重要建议。第一点，把妇女产前产后的假期从77天延长为112天。第二点，从1956年就开始把孕妇和有7岁以下孩子的母亲的工作日缩短两个小时，或者每星期有两天休息，工资照付。科夫里基娜的建议在大会上博得了热烈的掌声。
    妇女忘我地积极地参加社会劳动和政治活动。社会和国家给担负社会劳动和抚育后代双重任务的妇女以更好的物质保障。这是社会主义制度优越性的又一个标志。
