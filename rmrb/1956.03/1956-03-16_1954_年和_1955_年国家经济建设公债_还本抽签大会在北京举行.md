    Drawing Ceremony for Redemption of 1954 and 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds Held in Beijing

    The drawing ceremony for the second redemption of the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds and the first redemption of the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds was held on the afternoon of the 15th at the Xidan Theater in Beijing. More than 700 people from all walks of life in the capital and representatives from industrial and commercial circles in eight major cities, including Shanghai and Tianjin, attended the meeting.

    The meeting was presided over by Bei Zhongxuan, Assistant Minister of Finance. He said at the meeting that according to the regulations of the 1954 and 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds, the drawing date for redemption of the two bonds is September 30th each year. However, in order to allow bondholders to know whether their bonds have been drawn as soon as possible, so as to plan their personal economic lives, and to allow holders of winning bonds in various places to have sufficient time so that they can all receive principal and interest in total from September 30th, the annual redemption drawing for these two bonds has been brought forward to March 15th starting this year.

    Representatives from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, farmers in the suburbs of Beijing, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and industrial and commercial circles in Tianjin and Chongqing spoke at the meeting. They all supported bringing forward the annual redemption drawing time for these two bonds.

    Representatives from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce carried out the drawing, and representatives from the Fifth Office of the State Council and the Ministry of Supervision supervised the drawing. (Xinhua News Agency)

    1954年和1955年国家经济建设公债
    还本抽签大会在北京举行
    1954年国家经济建设公债的第二次抽签还本和1955年国家经济建设公债的第一次抽签还本大会，15日下午在北京西单剧场举行。到会的有首都各界人民和上海、天津等8大城市的工商界人士共700多人。
    大会由财政部部长助理贝仲选主持。他在会上说，按照1954年和1955年两期国家经济建设公债条例规定，两期公债的抽签还本日期是每年9月30日，但是为了使公债券持有人早日知道所持债券是否中签，以便有计划地安排个人经济生活，并且使各地中签债券的持有人有充分的时间，以便都能在9月30日起总付本息，特把这两期公债每年的还本抽签从今年起提前在3月15日举行。
    中华全国总工会、北京郊区农民、中华全国工商业联合会和天津、重庆二市工商界的代表在会上发言，他们都拥护把这两期公债每年的还本抽签时间提前。
    大会由中华全国总工会和中华全国工商业联合会代表执行抽签，由国务院第五办公室和监察部代表监督抽签。　（新华社）
