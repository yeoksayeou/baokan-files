Xinhua News Agency report

    The Yumen Oilfield Women's Survey Team has recently begun work in the Jiuquan Basin. This year, the team's work quota is significantly higher than in 1955, and the work area is sparsely populated with many high mountains. However, before departure, the team members pledged to complete this year's task one and a half months ahead of schedule. The team members decided to launch a red flag competition between groups starting in April. In the competition, they will also actively learn various advanced experiences. The entire team has also developed a plan to persist in studying political theory and science and technology while working in the field.
    The Yumen Oilfield Women's Survey Team was officially established in August 1954, and the team members are mostly girls around twenty years old. In 1954 and 1955, they overfulfilled the state plan.

    玉门油矿女子测量队
    到酒泉盆地开展工作
    玉门油矿女子测量队最近已经在酒泉盆地展开了工作。今年全队的工作定额比1955年大大提高了，工作的地区人烟比较稀少，而且高山很多。但是队员们在出发前还提出了提前一个半月完成今年的任务的保证。队员们确定要从四月份起开展组同组之间的红旗竞赛。在竞赛中还要积极学习各种先进经验。全队人员还订出了在野外坚持学习政治理论和科学技术的计划。
    玉门油矿女子测量队是在1954年8月正式成立的，队员大都是二十岁左右的姑娘。1954年和1955年她们都超额完成了国家计划。
