The management of arts and crafts as an independent industry is something that began in the new China after liberation. The "National Folk Arts and Crafts Exhibition" held by the Ministry of Culture at the end of 1953, and the simultaneous symposium of veteran folk artists and related cadres, were a turning point in the restoration and development of China's arts and crafts industry. After this exhibition and symposium, people widely understood the high artistic level of China's arts and crafts and recognized the significant relationship between arts and crafts and the lives of the broad masses of the people and the economic and cultural construction of the country. Especially in recent years, China has continuously selected various arts and crafts to be exhibited in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, and Northwest European countries, and some products have been sold in large quantities overseas, gaining universal praise internationally. Under these circumstances, the production enthusiasm of arts and crafts producers in various parts of the country has greatly increased, and many industries that had long ceased production or were on the verge of extinction have gradually recovered, such as ivory carving, jade ware, lacquer carving, stone carving, wood carving, clay sculpture, inlay, embroidery, Yun brocade, and several famous glazes of porcelain that were about to be lost, such as sacrificial red, tea dust, and beauty drunk, can now continue to be produced. According to preliminary statistics, there are currently about 150,000 arts and crafts producers with certain skills in the country. According to the overall plan of the All-China Federation of Handicraft Producers Cooperatives, the number of people engaged in manufacturing arts and crafts will be greatly increased during the Second Five-Year Plan.

Due to the urgent need of the country and the people for arts and crafts, this industry has developed rapidly. However, in the process of development, many shortcomings have inevitably emerged, such as unclear division of labor in supply, production, and sales, lack of coordination in various tasks, incompatibility between production and sales, disconnection between improvement work and production and sales, and the failure of cadre training to meet the needs of the entire industry. These scattered and chaotic phenomena are mainly caused by the lack of unified leadership.

First, due to the lack of unified leadership, the departments engaged in the supply, production, and sales of arts and crafts are seriously disconnected from the design and improvement departments in their work. For example, sales departments attempt to introduce arts and crafts to the broad masses of people at home and abroad, but they lack the ability to distinguish art and often manage arts and crafts as ordinary commodities; when they place orders with production departments, they only pay attention to general specifications and do not value artistic quality, resulting in a large number of products with very low artistic quality being sold overseas, thus resulting in returns or reduced order quantities, affecting international trade credit. The most prominent example is that a batch of embroidered cushions sold by an export company to the Soviet Union in 1952 were returned 20,000 pairs because of their low artistic quality.

The design and improvement departments have also failed to connect and integrate well with the sales departments, so that many products that have been initially improved or selected as relatively excellent cannot be sold for a while, making designers afraid to boldly continue to improve and organize experimental production.

Second, due to the lack of unified leadership, various sales units directly place orders with production units in various places, and all require priority delivery, making production units in various places feel at a loss. They reflect: "The Native Produce Export Company, the China Department Store, the Art Service Department, and other organizations all place orders with us, saying that they are all political tasks and they all want the goods urgently. Who should we accept the task first?" In fact, the orders from all parties are actually needed, and the production units have no reason to refuse their orders. Therefore, production plans are often disrupted, delivery times are often delayed, and various unnecessary misunderstandings are often caused between departments, hindering the progress of work. Of course, this is mainly a problem of supply exceeding demand, but if unified management and rational allocation can be carried out at present, some problems can be solved relatively.

Third, due to the lack of unified leadership, the work has not been comprehensively planned. When the relevant departments formulate plans, they act independently. The most obvious example is that the Department of Arts and Crafts of the Central Academy of Fine Arts stopped enrolling students from 1953 because the graduates trained in the early days of liberation could not all be dispatched. The teachers all closed their doors to prepare lessons, saying that they were "preparing conditions for the future establishment of an Academy of Arts and Crafts." Currently, it seems that all parties are gradually in need of talents in this field, and it has only been decided to enroll 25 students in 1956. According to the preliminary plan of the Central Handicraft Bureau, all art and craft practitioners in the country will be cooperativized this year and next year, and young apprentices will be trained in a planned way. It is estimated that at least two to three thousand arts and crafts experts and designers are needed to participate in production reform. How big is the gap! If such a problem is not considered and properly solved as soon as possible, in the future, thousands of arts and crafts production cooperatives will require art and craft designers to provide designs or ask for help in improving products. How can we cope with it!

Fourth, due to the lack of unified leadership, all the work carried out by the relevant departments is also done separately, such as holding exhibitions. The Bureau of Foreign Cultural Relations, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, the Handicraft Bureau, the Ministry of Textile Industry, the Silk Corporation, and other units often hold arts and crafts exhibitions abroad. They all formulate plans, raise funds, and send people to various places to select exhibits. After the exhibits are concentrated, they are labeled and briefly explained, and the task of an exhibition is completed. The various exhibitions are generally similar, and little attention is paid to the characteristics and special significance of each exhibition. Such a decentralized approach not only wastes the people's resources but also greatly weakens the due effect of exhibitions in international cultural exchanges and trade exchanges.

In order to strengthen the socialist transformation of individual handicraft producers of arts and crafts, the All-China Federation of Handicraft Producers Cooperatives is preparing to establish a "Bureau of Arts and Crafts" to be specifically responsible for the supply of raw materials, production guidance, and product adjustment related to arts and crafts. It is also preparing to establish a "Scientific Research Institute of Arts and Crafts" with the assistance of the Ministry of Culture, with various experimental workshops attached, to carry out the design and research of various arts and crafts, and to organize experts to cooperate with artists at any time to eliminate the disconnection between design and production, and gradually improve the production technology and artistic quality of products.

Such measures, from the current specific situation, can solve some of the above problems. However, problems such as the balance of production and sales, the coordination of improvement work and production and sales, the training of cadres, and overseas exhibitions cannot be uniformly and rationally resolved. Therefore, in order to completely solve the above problems, and to develop the arts and crafts industry more smoothly, it is hoped that the various units involved in the arts and crafts business can further contact and cooperate according to the principle of comprehensive planning and strengthened leadership. It is best to organize a unified leadership or guidance institution so that the entire work of the arts and crafts industry can be arranged and promoted more systematically and comprehensively.

    工艺美术事业需要统一领导
    新潮
    把工艺美术作为一种独立的事业来经营，是解放以后的新中国才开始实现的。1953年年底，文化部举办的“全国民间美术工艺品展览会”和同时召开的全国民间美术老艺人和有关干部座谈会，是我国工艺美术事业恢复发展的转折点。这次展览会和座谈会以后，人们广泛地了解我国工艺美术品的高度艺术水平，认识到工艺美术同广大人民生活和国家经济、文化建设的重大关系，特别是在最近几年中，我国不断选送各种工艺美术品到苏联和东欧、东南亚、西北欧各国去展览，以及部分产品大量外销以来，获得了国际上普遍的好评。在这样的情况下，国内各地工艺美术品生产者的生产积极性大大提高了，许多早已停止生产或已奄奄一息的行业逐渐恢复了，如象牙雕刻、玉器、雕漆、石刻、木雕、泥塑、镶嵌、刺绣、云锦和瓷器中几种即将失传的名釉如霁红、茶叶末、美人醉等，现在都能继续生产了。根据初步的统计，目前全国有一定技术的工艺美术品生产者约15万人，按照全国手工业生产合作总社的全面规划，第二个五年计划内，制造美术工艺品的从业人员还要大量增加。
    由于国家和人民对工艺美术品需要的迫切，这一事业飞速地发展起来。而在发展中却也不免产生了许多缺点，例如供产销业务分工不明、各项工作缺乏联系、生产同销售不能相适应、改良工作同产销业务脱节、干部培养未能适应整个事业的需要等等分散、混乱的现象。这些缺点，主要是由于缺乏统一领导所造成的。
    第一，由于没有统一领导，经营工艺美术品的供产销业务部门同设计改良部门之间在工作上严重地脱节。例如销售部门企图把工艺美术品介绍给国内外广大人民，可是缺乏艺术的鉴别能力，往往把工艺美术品作为普通商品来经营；当他们向生产部门加工定货时，也只注意一般规格，而不重视艺术质量，结果把一些艺术质量很低的产品大量外销，因此遭到退货或缩减定货数量，影响国际贸易信用。其中最突出的例子是，1952年某出口公司销售到苏联去的一批刺绣靠垫，因为艺术质量不高，结果退回来2万对。
    设计改良部门也没有能够很好地同销售部门联系和结合起来，以致许多经过初步改良或经过选择认为比较优秀的产品，一时无法销售出去，使设计者不敢大胆地继续进行改良和组织试验生产。
    第二，由于没有统一领导，各销售单位都直接向各地生产单位定货，并且都要求优先交货，使各地生产单位感到无所适从。他们这样反映：“土产出口公司，中国百货公司，美术服务部，以及其他机关团体，都向我们定货，说起来都是政治任务，要货又都要得急，叫我们先接受谁的任务好呢？”事实上各方面的定货都是实际需要的，生产单位都没有理由拒绝他们的定货，因此，常常打乱了生产计划，常常延误了交货时间，也常常引起各部门之间种种不必要的误会，妨碍工作的进行。当然，这主要是供不应求的问题，但在目前如能统一管理、合理调配，是可以相对地解决些问题的。
    第三，由于没有统一领导，工作未能作全面规划。各有关部门订计划的时候，各自为政。最显著的例子是，中央美术学院工艺美术系因解放初期培养出来的毕业生不能全部派出去，从1953年起便停止招生，教员们都闭门备课，说是“为将来创办工艺美术学院准备条件”，目前看各方面渐渐需要这方面的人才了，才决定在1956年先招收25名。根据中央手工业管理局初步规划，今年和明年以内，就要将全国美术工艺方面的从业人员全部合作化，并将有计划地培养青年艺徒，估计至少需要两三千名工艺美术专家和设计人员，去参加生产改革，试问这是多大的距离！这样一个问题，如果不及早考虑加以适当解决，将来成千上万的工艺美术品生产合作社，都要求美术工艺设计工作者供给图样，或者要求帮助他们改良产品，那怎么应付得了！
    第四，由于没有统一领导，各有关部门进行的一切工作，也都是各办各的，例如办展览会。对外文化联络局，对外贸易促进委员会，手工业管理局，纺织工业部，丝绸公司等等单位，都经常举办工艺美术品出国展览，他们都各自订立计划，筹措经费，各自派员去各地选购展品。展品集中以后，加上标签和简单说明，就算完成一个展览会的任务。各个展览会大体相似，很少注意各个展览的特点和特殊意义。这样分散的做法，不但浪费人民物力，而且大大减弱了展览会在国际文化交流和贸易往来上应得的效果。
    为了加强对工艺美术品的个体手工业生产者进行社会主义改造，全国手工业生产合作总社正准备设立“工艺美术局”，专门负责有关工艺美术品的原料供应、生产辅导、产品调节等工作。还准备在文化部协助下创办“工艺美术科学研究所”，附设各种实验作坊，进行各种工艺美术品的设计、研究工作，并随时组织专家同艺人合作，以消除设计同生产的脱节现象，逐步提高产品的生产技术和艺术质量。
    这种措施，就目前具体情况来看，是能够解决上述问题中的一部分问题的。但是，例如生产同销售的平衡、改良工作同产销业务的配合、干部的培养和出国展览等问题，仍然不可能得到统一的合理解决。所以，为了彻底解决上述各项问题，为了更顺利地发展工艺美术事业，希望有关工艺美术业务的各单位能根据全面规划、加强领导的原则，进一步联系合作，最好能组织一个统一领导或指导的机构，以便更有计划地全面安排和推进工艺美术事业的整个工作。
