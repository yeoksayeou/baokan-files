    Actively Expand the Ranks of Advanced Producers
    By our reporter Wang Lin
    The Shijiazhuang Freight Car Repair Plant of the Ministry of Railways was named a National Advanced Plant by the Ministry of Railways in 1955 because it comprehensively and consistently overfulfilled the state plan every month during the national railway factory competition in 1955 and completed its annual production tasks one month ahead of schedule.
    One of the main reasons why this plant was able to comprehensively and consistently overfulfill the state plan every month is that it actively expanded the ranks of advanced producers. The plant now has 16 advanced production teams and groups, one advanced workshop, and 115 advanced producers. These include Wang Xinnian, a young lathe operator who completed the workload of the First Five-Year Plan two years and fifteen days ahead of schedule; the Hou Dequan trolley team, which improved production efficiency and product quality by implementing process regulations; and the Sixth Riveting Area, which maintained balanced production while continuously improving labor efficiency. This large team of advanced producers is spread throughout the plant's various sections and workshops. Their advanced ideas and deeds have a tremendous inspiring effect on the vast majority of workers. "Learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and strive to join the ranks of advanced producers to contribute the greatest strength to the country's socialist construction" has become the unanimous action of the vast majority of workers at the Shijiazhuang Freight Car Repair Plant.
    Timely resolution of ideological problems and concrete organizational measures are the fundamental reasons why the Shijiazhuang Freight Car Repair Plant can ensure the continuous expansion of the ranks of advanced producers. In the spring of 1954, the Freight Car Repair Plant Party Committee discovered that some workshop leaders did not have a sufficient understanding of the purpose of cultivating advanced producers. Instead of helping and encouraging existing advanced producers to continue to improve and constantly lead the masses forward, they were afraid that the masses would catch up with or surpass them. For example, Wu Zhiyong, a lathe operator in the mechanical workshop, caught up with and surpassed Zhao Yingfa, the plant's labor model. However, the workshop leaders believed that if the labor model's achievements were surpassed, it would reduce the labor model's prestige and they were afraid that the labor model would collapse and they would not be able to bear the responsibility. Therefore, they adopted an attitude of indifference towards Wu Zhiyong. The workers were also influenced by this guiding ideology, believing that the labor model's achievements "should not be surpassed." Therefore, when formulating production plans, Wu Zhiyong often kept his production targets two notches lower than Zhao Yingfa's. The Party Committee also learned that many cadres treated workers' shortcomings with a fixed mindset, ignored their desire for progress, and even misinterpreted their progressive actions. For example, Fan Rongfu, a worker in the sawmill team of the timber workshop, proposed four suggestions for improving the lumber yield. However, the workshop leaders believed that he was a backward worker who did not like to participate in political activities and would not put forward valuable suggestions. Even if the suggestions were good, they were just for showing off, so they did not even study them. Some workers said, "The leadership can't see us. No matter how much we achieve, there is no hope of becoming an advanced producer." Because of this, plans to cultivate advanced producers often failed. The Party Committee promptly criticized this thinking at the joint meetings of workshop branch secretaries, clearly pointing out the purpose of cultivating advanced producers and the leadership's responsibility: to raise the awareness of the masses, cherish the workers' slightest socialist enthusiasm, and promote their positive factors while overcoming negative factors. The Party Committee also repeatedly conducted education among Party members and cadres on "helping and improving the backward, discovering and cultivating the advanced." In order to ensure that the previous lessons would not be repeated, the Party Committee formulated a plan for the plant to expand the ranks of advanced producers and instructed each workshop branch and Party group to formulate specific plans to ensure the implementation of the plant-wide plan and regularly check the implementation of the plan. It also designated specific personnel to be responsible for leading the work of improving existing advanced producers. In order to support workers' technological reforms and ensure that rationalization proposals were promptly processed, the plant set up full-time engineers to handle rationalization proposals, and the trade union further improved the rationalization proposal committee. The factory commended and rewarded Wu Zhiyong, who should have been commended before but was not. Wang Zhongnian, the secretary of the plant Party Committee, personally found Fan Rongfu, whose rationalization proposal was considered backward and ignored by the workshop leaders, and educated and encouraged him to re-submit his proposal. Fan Rongfu said excitedly to Ren Qinghua, the director of the workshop, "I am neither a Party member nor a League member, but the Party values me and supports me so much. I will definitely do a good job!" He successively improved 59 kinds of material selection methods, increasing the lumber yield from 51.94% to 63.45%, saving the country more than 240,000 yuan a year.
    Leading personnel go deep into workshops and teams, conduct detailed investigations and research by checking the completion of production plans, and grasp the ideological trends of each worker from the political or production movements of each period, paying attention to their every slight progress in thought or production. To this end, the Party Committee stipulated that the plant's leading personnel (including members of the Party Committee) must spend at least two hours a day going deep into the workshops. Once the leaders go deep into the workshops, a large number of advanced things are discovered in a timely manner. For example, when the Party Committee Secretary was inspecting work in the freight car workshop, he heard workshop cadres say that Yao Erzhu, who was not active in production in the past, had completed 157% of his quota. He sent people to summarize his experience and found that he did have advanced aspects, so he commended him and promoted his experience in the workshop. When inspecting the completion of the savings plan, the leaders discovered and commended Li Xizi, Liu Delin, and others who saved the country 17,000 yuan by using 280 old cold steel wheels, setting an example of practicing thrift for the vast majority of workers. When inspecting the implementation of process regulations, they also discovered and commended the Hou Dequan trolley team, which seriously implemented the regulations and greatly improved production efficiency and product quality. The factory leaders also grasped the law that workers' thinking must change in every production or political movement, and that a batch of advanced producers will inevitably emerge due to the growth of advanced thinking. Therefore, whenever a new movement is launched, they study and formulate plans to discover new advanced producers and improve existing ones. For example, in the movement to learn from Wang Chonglun's spirit of innovation, due to the leadership's full ideological preparation, they quickly discovered Wang Xinnian, who felt pained by his past lack of enthusiasm for production and expressed his willingness to contribute the greatest strength to the country's socialist construction in the future. After encouragement and help from the leadership and his own painstaking research, he improved his operating methods and 11 kinds of tools, and formulated and completed an advanced plan exceeding the quota by 300%, completing the workload of the first Five-Year Plan two years and 15 days ahead of schedule.
    The factory not only gave timely honorary and material rewards to the advanced producers who emerged, but also implemented the principle of correspondingly increasing the actual income of workers as their labor productivity increased. Within the prescribed time limit, they never revised the quota because the advanced producers broke through the quota, and even more so, they did not reduce the labor remuneration for the excess portion because the advanced producers automatically revised the quota. At the same time, they also gave timely commendation and material rewards to those who learned advanced experience and advanced technology and caught up with advanced producers. For example, Jia Guixi, a lathe operator in the axle process of the wheel workshop, actively learned from Wang Xinnian's experience in preparing for production and shortening non-production time. At the same time, he improved 8 kinds of tools and operating methods, and successively caught up with and surpassed Wang Xinnian's working hour quota. The Party Committee and administrative leaders promptly commended him and went to the workshop with gongs and drums to give him awards. The leading staff also often encouraged those who were learning advanced skills and studying technology at meetings and in individual conversations. The implementation of the reward policy encourages learning from the advanced, making the vast majority of workers realize that as long as they make a little progress in production and contribute a little more to the country, they will be valued by the leadership; only by constantly improving production efficiency and ensuring the continuous development of the country's production and construction cause can personal lives be improved; and they also experience that as long as they work hard, they can reach or exceed the level of advanced producers. Now, each workshop, team, and worker has formulated an advanced production plan to strive to join the ranks of advanced producers and make contributions to the country's socialist construction cause. In 1955, the plant promoted 25 kinds of advanced experiences with decisive significance; adopted and effectively implemented 114 rationalization proposals; and saw the emergence of 57 advanced producers, equivalent to the total of the previous 7 years.
    In order to effectively improve the technical level of the vast majority of workers and meet their desire to learn advanced experience and join the ranks of advanced producers, the factory promptly carried out concrete organizational work. They used spare-time technical schools and short-term training courses to impart the advanced experiences of Kolezov, Unanov, Zhuang Minggeng, and others from other places; and used summary reports, technical seminars, on-site observation, and organization of advanced producer demonstration performances to disseminate the advanced experiences created by the plant's workers. In this way, advanced things were quickly mastered by the vast majority of workers. In 1955, they used these methods to promote 25 kinds of advanced experiences and included them in the process regulations. 304 workers were promoted in grade. The average technical level of the plant's workers increased from 3.5 to 3.7. This created reliable technical conditions for expanding the ranks of advanced producers.
    This factory assigned specific personnel to be responsible for educating advanced producers, promptly setting new goals for them to strive for, so that they could continue to move forward, strengthen their ties with the masses, and actively help other workers. After Wang Xinnian improved his tools, other workers also liked to use them, so he took the initiative to lend them to the workers on the next shift. However, some people only used them and did not sharpen them. Instead of thinking of a positive solution, he hid the tools, creating a gap between them. The plant's Youth League Committee discovered this situation and pointed out to him that if others have shortcomings, they should be kindly pointed out and helped to improve. Passively hiding the tools would hinder unity and others would not get help. Later, Wang Xinnian not only lent the tools to others, but also personally taught his operating methods to others. Because the advanced actively helped the backward and the backward worked hard to learn from the advanced, this workshop successively saw the emergence of 13 advanced producers with outstanding production efficiency and advanced experience with universal promotion value. The production efficiency of the entire workshop increased by 38.64% compared to a year ago. In January of this year, 660 workers throughout the plant broke through the newly revised quotas. In the first and middle ten days of February, the labor efficiency of the plant's workers averaged more than 20% above the quota. Now, more than 200 workers have automatically revised their quotas; and 12 workers who were previously relatively backward have reached the level of advanced producers. New advanced producers are emerging in large numbers. In this new situation, the Freight Car Repair Plant has expanded the engineer in charge of rationalization proposals from one person to a group of five, and has delegated the general technical improvement proposals to the workshops for handling on their own. It has also decided to announce the conditions for advanced producers in various types of work and formally launch the youth shock force and advanced producer movement. This will further accelerate the expansion of the ranks of advanced producers and further improve production and management levels.

    积极扩大先进生产者队伍
    本报记者　王林
    铁道部石家庄货车修理厂，在1955年全国铁路工厂的厂际竞赛中，月月全面、均衡地超额完成国家计划，并提前一个月完成了全年的生产任务，因而被评为1955年度铁道部的全国先进厂。
    这个厂所以能够月月全面、均衡地超额完成国家计划，主要的一个原因，就是积极扩大先进生产者的队伍。现在这个厂共有16个先进生产班、组，一个先进车间和115个先进生产者。其中有提前二年零十五天完成第一个五年计划工作量的青年旋工王新年，有贯彻执行工艺规程提高了生产效率和产品质量的侯德全台车小组，有在不断提高劳动效率的基础上保持均衡生产的第六铆工区。这支庞大的先进生产者队伍，遍布在全厂的各个工段和车间。他们的先进思想和事迹，在广大职工中起着巨大的鼓舞作用。“学习先进，赶上先进，争取加入先进生产者行列，为祖国的社会主义建设贡献最大的力量。”已经成石家庄货车修理厂广大职工一致的行动。
    及时地解决思想问题，采取具体的组织措施，是石家庄货车修理厂能保证先进生产者队伍不断扩大的基本原因。1954年春，货车修理厂党委发觉有些车间领导人员对培养先进生产者的目的性认识不足，对已有的先进生产者，不是帮助和鼓励他们继续提高，不断地带领群众前进，而是怕群众赶上或超过他们。如机械车间的车工吴志勇，赶上并超过了厂的劳动模范赵英发，但是车间领导人员认为：劳动模范的成绩被人超过，会降低劳动模范的威信，怕劳动模范垮了台负不起责任，因而对吴志勇采取了置之不理的态度。工人也受了这种领导思想的影响，认为劳动模范的成绩是“不应该被超过”的，所以吴志勇在制定生产计划的时候，经常保持着比赵英发低两格。党委还了解到：有很多干部以一成不变的眼光对待工人的缺点，漠视他们的进步要求，甚至曲解他们的进步行动。如制材车间锯木组工人樊荣福，提出了提高锯材成材率的四条建议，车间领导人员却认为他是个不爱参加政治活动的落后工人，不会提出有价值的建议来，建议即使好，也是为了出风头，因而连研究也没研究。有些工人就说：“领导上看不见我们，干出多大成绩，也没当先进生产者的希望。”正因为这样，培养先进生产者的计划常常落空。党委及时地在车间支部书记联席会上批判了这种思想，明确指出培养先进生产者的目的，领导的责任是：提高群众觉悟，爱护职工的点滴的社会主义热情，发扬他们的积极因素，克服消极因素。党委还反复地在党员、干部中进行“帮助和提高落后，发现和培养先进”的教育。为了保证不再重复以前的教训，党委制定了全厂扩大先进生产者队伍的规划，并责成各个车间支部和党小组制定保证实现全厂规划的具体计划，定期检查计划的执行情况；指定专人负责领导提高现有先进生产者的工作。为了支持工人的技术改革，保证合理化建议得到迅速处理，厂内设置了专职的处理合理化建议的工程师，工会也进一步健全了合理化建议委员会。工厂表扬和奖励了以前应该表扬而没有表扬的吴志勇。厂党委书记王中年，亲自找到被车间领导人员认为落后而不理他的合理化建议的樊荣福，教育和鼓励他重新提出建议。樊荣福激动地对车间主任任庆华说：“我不是党员也不是团员，党这样重视我、支持我，我一定好好干！”他先后改进了59种取材方法，使木材的成材率由51.94％提到了63.45％，一年可为国家节约24万多元。
    领导人员深入车间、小组，通过检查生产计划的完成情形，进行细致的调查研究；抓住各个时期的政治或生产运动，从运动中了解每个工人的思想动态，注意他们在思想上或生产上的每一微小进步。为此，党委规定了厂的领导人员（包括党委委员）每天起码要有两个钟头深入车间。领导一深入车间，大量的先进事物都及时地被发现了。如党委书记在货车车间检查工作的时候，听到车间干部说过去生产不积极的姚二柱完成了定额的157％，就派人加以总结，发现他确实有先进的地方，就表扬他，并在车间推广他的经验。领导人员在检查节约计划完成的情形的时候，发现并表扬了利用280个旧冷钢轮，为国家节约17，000元的李喜子、刘德林等人，给广大职工树立了厉行节约的榜样。在检查工艺规程的执行情况的时候，又发现并表扬了认真执行规程，大大提高生产效率和产品质量的侯德全台车小组。工厂的领导还掌握了工人在每一个生产或政治运动中，思想一定要发生变化，由于先进思想的增长，必然涌现出一批先进生产者这一规律。所以，每逢开展一个新的运动，都研究、制定发现新的、提高原有的先进生产者的计划。如在学习王崇伦的革新精神的运动中，由于领导思想有充分准备，很快地就发现了对自己过去生产不起劲感到痛心，表示愿在今后为祖国的社会主义建设贡献最大力量的王新年。经过领导上的鼓励、帮助和他自己的苦心钻研，改进了操作方法和11种工具，制定和完成了超过定额300％的先进计划，提前两年零15天完成了第一个五年计划的工作量。
    这个厂对涌现出来的先进生产者，不仅及时地给予荣誉的和物质的奖励，并且贯彻执行了随着职工劳动生产率的提高，相应地增加职工的实际收入的原则。在规定期限之内，决不因为先进生产者突破了定额而修改定额，更不因为先进生产者自动修订了定额，而减少给他们超额部分以劳动报酬。同时对学习先进经验、先进技术，而赶上先进生产者的人，也及时地给以表扬，给以物质奖励。如车轮车间车轴工序的车工贾贵喜，积极学习王新年作好生产准备、缩短非生产时间的经验，同时又改进了8种工具和操作方法，先后赶上并超过了王新年的工时定额，党委和行政领导就及时地表扬他，敲锣打鼓地到车间去给他发奖。领导工作人员还经常在会议上，在个别谈话中，鼓励那些正在学习先进、钻研技术的人。贯彻执行奖励政策，鼓励学习先进，使广大职工认识到：只要在生产中有一点进步，对国家多作出一点贡献，就会受到领导上的重视；只有不断地提高生产效率，保证国家生产建设事业的不断发展，个人的生活才得到改善；同时也体验到只要努力，就可以达到或超过先进生产者的水平。现在，各个车间、小组和工人，都制定了争取加入先进生产者行列，为国家的社会主义建设事业立功的先进生产计划。1955年，全厂就推行了25种有决定意义的先进经验；被采纳并行之有效的合理化建议114条；出现了57名先进生产者，相当于以前7年的总和。
    为了有效地提高广大职工的技术水平，满足他们学习先进经验、加入先进生产者行列的愿望，工厂及时地进行了具体的组织工作。他们用业余技术学校、短期训练班的方法，传授科列索夫、乌纳诺夫、庄铭耕等外地的先进经验；利用总结报告、技术座谈、现场观摩、组织先进生产者示范表演等方法，传播本厂工人创造的先进经验。这样，先进的东西很快就为广大职工所掌握了。1955年，他们用这些方法，推行了25种先进经验，并把它们列入了工艺规程。有304名工人升了级。全厂工人的技术水平，平均由3.5级提高到3.7级。这给扩大先进生产者队伍创造可靠的技术条件。
    这个厂确定专人负责教育先进生产者，及时给他们提出新的奋斗目标，使他们不断地前进，加强同群众的联系，积极帮助别的工人。王新年在改进了刀具以后，别的工人也很喜欢用，他就主动地借给下一班的工人。但是，有的人只用不磨，他没想积极的办法，却把刀具藏了起来，造成了相互之间的隔阂。厂团委发觉了这个情况，就给他指出：别人有缺点，应该善意地提出，帮助他改进，消极地把刀具藏起来就会妨碍团结，别人也得不到帮助。以后，王新年不仅把刀具借给别人，而且亲自动手把自己的操作方法教给别人。由于先进积极帮助落后，落后努力向先进学习，这个车间先后出现了13名生产效率突出、创造了有普遍推广价值的先进经验的先进生产者，全车间的生产效率，较一年前提高了38.64％。今年1月份，全厂有660名工人突破了刚修改不久的新定额。2月份上中两旬，全厂工人的劳动效率平均超过了定额20％。现在已经有200多名工人自动修改了定额；原来比较落后的12名工人，都达到了先进生产者的水平。新的先进生产者在大量涌现。在这新的情况下，货车修理厂已经把处理合理化建议工作的工程师，由一个人扩大为五人小组，并把一般的技术改进的建议，委托车间自行处理。还决定公布各工种的先进生产者的条件，正式开展青年突击手和先进生产者运动。这将更加加速先进生产者队伍的扩大，使生产和管理水平进一步提高。
