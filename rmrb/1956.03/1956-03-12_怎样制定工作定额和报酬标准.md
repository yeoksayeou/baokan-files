How to Formulate Work Quotas and Remuneration Standards
Liu Shibao, Deputy Secretary of the Wu'an County Committee of the Communist Party of China

Wu'an County, Hebei Province, has achieved complete socialist agricultural cooperation. To consolidate agricultural production cooperatives, we must adopt scientific and advanced management methods. To organize labor and calculate labor remuneration using scientific and advanced methods, the most important task is to formulate work quotas and remuneration standards.

Formulating work quotas is a complex and meticulous task, and we had no experience in this work in the past. We first organized a work group, led by the county party committee, to conduct a typical experiment in the relatively well-established Bei Wenzhang Cooperative, which had more management experience. After summarizing the management experience of the elementary cooperatives, consulting with the cooperative's leaders, and conducting practical experiments, the preliminary experience we gained was:

The first step is to do a good job of ideological mobilization and establish an organization for formulating work quotas. Initially, the problem we encountered was that cooperative cadres were afraid of trouble and worried about wasting energy if they didn't do a good job. After repeatedly explaining the benefits of formulating work quotas using the actual problems existing in the cooperative's management and operation, we gradually unified the thinking of the cooperative cadres and decided to try it out. Cooperative Director Yang Changqing said, "Without enduring bitterness, it's difficult to enjoy sweetness. If you dislike trouble in everything, you'll never be able to create advanced experience." After the quotas were announced to the cooperative members, three kinds of thinking emerged: (1) Those with strong labor and high skills, who actively supported the quotas, accounted for about 80%; (2) Those with weaker labor, who were afraid of not completing the quotas and receiving fewer points, accounted for about 15%; (3) Those who liked to slack off and opposed the quotas accounted for about 5%. In response to this situation, party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and cooperative cadres went to each team to educate the members in various forms about the idea that "remuneration according to labor is reasonable, and it is shameful to live without working," explaining the benefits of managing labor and calculating remuneration according to work quotas, and criticizing the erroneous thinking of wanting to take advantage and slack off, gradually dispelling the masses' concerns. Subsequently, the cooperative determined to have the cooperative director take the lead, absorbing several cooperative cadres and experienced farmers to form a quota research group, specifically to take charge of this work.

The second step is to formulate a good annual production plan and, according to the production plan, classify various farm tasks in detail by crop, region, sideline occupation, and basic construction.

The third step is to rank farm tasks and divide them into grades. First, according to the order of the production plan and operating procedures, the various farm tasks are divided into 16 major categories according to their nature: plowing and moisture retention, sowing, inter-tilling, fertilizing, field management, pest control, replanting and autumn harvesting, hoeing dikes and leveling land, transporting manure, spreading manure, chopping straw, raising livestock, seed selection, seed soaking, out-of-pen bedding, tipping manure, accumulating fertilizer, and managing cooperative affairs. Then, according to the nature of the major categories, they are divided into 103 sub-categories. For example, the major category of moisture retention is divided into sub-categories such as harrowing and rolling. Then, according to seasonal busy-ness, the lightness, heaviness, dirtiness, and cleanliness of the work, the level of skill required, and other conditions, the tasks are divided into five grades. Grade one farm tasks include operating seed drills, plowing, threshing, manually carrying things, harvesting wheat, cleaning pig pens, etc., totaling 23 items; grade two farm tasks include driving carts, pulling things, harvesting millet, harrowing, etc., totaling 47 items; grade three farm tasks include hoeing, picking cotton, etc., totaling 24 items; grade four farm tasks include managing cotton, etc., totaling 26 items; and grade five farm tasks include picking cotton seeds, etc., totaling 3 items. Specific regulations were made for each major and minor farm task. On the basis of grading, the standards for work remuneration were determined separately for each grade according to the differences in each grade of farm task. Grade one farm tasks earned 13 points, grade two farm tasks earned 10.5 points, grade three farm tasks earned 9 points, grade four farm tasks earned 8 points, and grade five farm tasks earned 7 points.

The fourth step is to determine that the labor time for completing a work quota is 9 hours. Then, according to the distance of each farm task, the fragmentation of the land, the difficulty of cultivation, the lightness, heaviness, dirtiness, and cleanliness of the work, the degree of skill required, the complexity of the farm task, the seasonal busy-ness, the strength of the livestock, the condition of the farm tools, and other conditions, select standards for each grade and item, evaluate models, compare against the standards, discuss in detail, and determine the quotas for various tasks (that is, the quantity and quality that can be completed in 9 hours). For example, for the grade one task of planting cotton, using a mule and a wide seed drill, ensuring that the ridges are straight, the backs are even, the depth is two inches, the seeds are evenly distributed, and good seedling emergence is guaranteed, planting 20 mu is counted as one quota, and completing one quota earns 13 work points. For the grade two task of hoeing millet for the first time, hoeing millet with small ridges and full seedlings, ensuring that the hoeing is even, no weeds are left, no bare soil is left, the seedlings are thinned well and evenly, leaving one plant every 1 to 2 inches, the seedlings are not buried, and the seedlings do not fall over, hoeing one mu is counted as one quota, and completing one quota earns 10.5 points. And so on, quotas are stipulated for each item and task.

The fifth step is to stipulate various necessary systems and strengthen specific leadership. Each production team makes short-term arrangements according to the overall plan of the entire cooperative; the groups do a good job of distributing labor and carry out specific division of labor. A system of layered contract responsibility and layered mutual inspection has been established, and labor discipline has been formulated. Those who complete the quota according to the standard are credited with work points according to the graded work remuneration standard; those who do not complete the quota or do not meet the quality standard will have their points deducted or be required to make up the work as appropriate.

The sixth step is for the quota research group to submit the preliminary quotas and remuneration standards to the cooperative members' congress for discussion and revision, and to adopt them item by item as the final plan.

We have learned from practice that the advantages of this method of managing labor are: (1) The cooperative members and cadres have a clear idea, which further strengthens their confidence in running the cooperative; (2) It can guarantee the completion of the production plan on time and with the required quality and quantity; (3) The cooperative cadres are not flustered, and production is orderly; (4) It overcomes the disputes, confusion, and unreasonable phenomena of scoring and recording work points; (5) It realizes remuneration according to labor and equal pay for equal work for men and women; (6) It overcomes the blindness of production and construction; (7) It solves the problem of some cooperative members only seeking light work and being unwilling to do dirty and heavy work, and reforms individual lazy cooperative members; (8) It overcomes the departmentalism of cooperative cadres and the selfishness of cooperative members, and further encourages the enthusiasm of cooperative members for labor; (9) It assigns work and professions according to talent, arranging farm work for each person, which can both give play to each person's skills and ensure that all types of cooperative members work rationally.

The comrades of the county party committee went deeply into key areas in this way, gained preliminary experience, enriched their knowledge, and also educated many cadres, laying the foundation for the universal implementation of this scientific and advanced labor management method.

In December, the county party committee trained more than 2,000 township and cooperative cadres and more than 100 county and district cadres in three batches, enabling them to understand the methods of formulating work quotas and recognizing the benefits of this method, and universally promoting the labor management system throughout the county.

After this system was universally implemented in all cooperatives in the county, in order to guide the movement with experience, the county party committee had planned in advance to focus on Nanyangyi Cooperative in the seventh district and Zhuchang Cooperative in the third district, enabling them to move ahead step by step. In addition to regularly introducing them through circulars and organizing experienced cadres to teach and exchange ideas in other townships and cooperatives, when carrying out the most complex and meticulous tasks such as ranking farm tasks and dividing them into grades and items, they also summarized the experience of key cooperatives and convened the cooperative directors and those responsible for formulating quotas in two groups to visit the key cooperatives, further enabling them to understand the methods, steps, and issues to be aware of. At the same time, it also overcame the phenomenon of grasping one thing and losing another in the formulation of quotas. Now, 92 cooperatives in the county have universally implemented this system.

    怎样制定工作定额和报酬标准
    中共武安县委副书记　刘士保
    河北省武安县已经实现了完全社会主义的农业合作化。要巩固农业生产合作社，必须采取科学的先进的管理方法。要用科学的先进的方法组织劳动和计算劳动报酬，一项最主要的工作就是制定工作定额和报酬标准。
    制定工作定额是一个复杂而细致的工作，我们过去对这个工作没有经验。我们首先组织了一个工作组，由县委亲自带领，到基础较好、管理经验较多的北文章社作了典型试验。经过总结初级社的管理经验，和社内领导人员进行协商研究及实际试验，初步摸索出来的经验是：
    第一步，做好思想发动工作，建立制定工作定额的组织。开始，碰到的问题是社干部有怕麻烦、怕搞不好白费精力的思想顾虑。经过用社内在经营管理上存在的实际问题，反复讲解了制定工作定额的好处后，才逐渐统一了社干部的思想，确定要试办一下。社主任杨常青说：“不吃苦中苦，难得甜上甜，事事嫌麻烦，啥时候也创造不出先进经验。”当把定额向社员公布以后，出现了三种思想：（1）劳力强、技术高积极拥护的占80％左右；（2）劳力较弱、怕完不成定额少记分的占15％左右；（3）好耍滑头、表示反对的有5％左右。针对这种情况，党员、团员、社干部分头深入各队，通过各种形式向社员进行了“按劳取酬合理，不劳而食可耻”的教育，说明按工作定额管理劳动和计算报酬的好处，并批判想沾光、耍滑头的错误思想，逐渐解除了群众的顾虑。随后，社里便确定以社主任为主，吸收若干社干部和种地有经验的社员，组成定额研究小组，具体掌握这个工作。
    第二步，订好全年的生产计划，并根据生产计划按照种植作物和区划以及副业、基本建设等，逐类逐项把各种农活详细进行分类。
    第三步，农活排队，划分等级。首先根据生产计划和操作规程的顺序，按照各种农活的性质共分为耕地保墒、播种、中耕、施肥、田间管理、除治虫害、复种秋收、刨堰整地、送粪、撒粪、铡草、饲养、选种、浸种、出圈垫圈、倒粪、积肥、管理社务等16个大项，然后根据大项性质又划了103个小项。如保墒一大项内又分为耙地、杖地等几个小项。然后，再根据季节忙闲、活的轻重脏净、技术高低等条件划分为五个等级。一级农活包括扶耧、耕地、打场、人力担抬东西、割麦子、出猪圈等23项；二级农活包括赶车、拉东西、割谷子、耙耱地等47项；三级农活包括锄地、摘棉花等24项；四级农活包括管理棉花等26项；五级农活包括拣棉籽等3项。每一个大小农活都作了具体规定。在划好等级的基础上根据各级农活的差别，分级确定了工作报酬的标准。一级农活13分，二级农活10.5分，三级农活9分，四级农活8分，五级农活7分。
    第四步，确定每完成一个工作定额的劳动时间为9小时。然后，根据各项农活的位置远近、地块零整、耕作难易、轻重脏净、技术程度、农活繁简、季节忙闲、畜力强弱、农具新旧等条件，逐级逐项选择标准，评出榜样，对照标准，详细评议，确定各种工作的定额（就是每9小时能完成的数量和质量）。例如一级活种棉花，用骡马一头，用宽耧，作到垅直背匀、深二寸、籽匀盖好保齐苗，种20亩算一个定额，完成一个定额记13分工。如二级活锄头遍谷子，锄小垅全苗谷子，做到锄匀，不留草，不留白板皮，留好苗，留匀苗，每1至2寸留一棵，不埋苗，苗不倒，锄一亩算一个定额，完成一个定额记10.5分。以此类推，逐项逐样都规定了定额。
      第五步，规定各项必要的制度，加强具体领导。各生产队根据全社整个计划，都作出了短期安排；小组作好劳动力的支配，具体进行分工分业。建立了层层包干负责、层层互相检查的制度，制定了劳动纪律。按定额完成者，按分级的工作报酬标准记工；完不成或达不到质量标准的，酌情减分或补工。
      第六步，定额研究小组把各项定额和报酬标准初步拟定以后，交社员大会讨论修改，逐项通过，作为定案。
    我们从实践过程中体验到这种管理劳动的办法的好处是：（1）社员社干部心中有了数，进一步坚定了办社信心；（2）能保证按质按量按时完成生产计划；（3）社干部不忙乱，生产有秩序；（4）克服了评分记工的争吵忙乱和不合理现象；（5）实现了按劳取酬和男女同工同酬；（6）克服了生产和施工的盲目性；（7）解决了部分社员光找轻活、不愿作脏重活的问题，改造了个别懒惰社员；（8）克服了社干部本位主义和社员的自私思想，进一步鼓舞了社员的劳动积极性；（9）量才分工分业，逐人安排农活，既能发挥每个人的一技之长，作到人尽其才，又能保证各类社员合理出工。
    县委的同志们这样深入重点，取得了初步经验，丰富了自己的知识，也教育了许多干部，为普遍推行这种科学的先进的劳动管理方法奠定了基础。
    县委在12月份，分三批训练了2，000多名乡、社干部和100多名县、区干部，使他们初步懂得制定工作定额的方法，认识这种办法的好处，在全县范围内普遍推行劳动管理制度。
    这种制度在全县各个社普遍推行以后，县委为了作到用经验来指导运动，事先又有计划地在七区南阳邑社、三区竹昌社搞了两个重点，使它步步走在前头，除了经常用通报介绍和组织有经验的干部到外乡外社传授交流以外，在进行农活排队、分级分项等最复杂最细致的工作的时候，又总结了重点社的经验，分两片召集各社社长和负责制定定额的人到重点社参观，使他们进一步了解了方法、步骤和应注意的问题。同时，也克服了在制定定额中抓东丢西的现象。现在，全县92个社已经普遍实行了这种制度。
