Comprehensive Construction of Shimen Reservoir
The Shimen Reservoir, a key water conservancy project in Hubei Province, is now under full-scale construction. Once completed, this reservoir can hold 122.6 million cubic meters of floodwater, reducing the threat of flooding to 400,000 mu of farmland along the banks of the Changtanbu to Tianmen River; it can irrigate 350,000 mu of state-owned Shayang Farm, Changtanbu Livestock Farm, and farmland belonging to the masses; it can generate 337 kilowatts of electricity year-round; and it can also be used for fish farming and developing forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations.

To ensure the project's progress outpaces the flood season, the Party Committee at the construction site recently made a comprehensive plan based on the original construction plan, proposing that the reservoir portion be completed by the end of June. A large number of dump trucks and handcarts will be used to transport earth during construction, and a considerable amount of machinery will be used in other projects as well. (Zhang Daba)

    石门水库全面施工
    湖北省重点水利工程——石门水库已经全面施工。这个水库建成以后，可以拦蓄12，260万公方洪水，减除长滩埠至天门河两岸四十万亩田地的水灾威胁；可以灌溉国营沙洋农场长滩埠农牧场及群众水旱田地三十五万亩；可以常年发电337瓩；还可以养鱼，发展林牧副业等。
    为了保证工程的进度跑在洪水前面，工地党委会最近根据原施工计划重新作了全面规划，提出水库部分六月底全部完工。施工中要使用大量斗车和架子车运土，其他工程中也要使用不少机械。　（张达柏）
