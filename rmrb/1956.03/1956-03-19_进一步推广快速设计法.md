    To Further Promote the Rapid Design Method
    At the advanced producers conference held on the 17th, the Anshan Branch of the Heavy Industry Ministry's Ferrous Metallurgical Design Institute proposed further and widely promoting the rapid design method created by young technician Zhang Fengtai.
    In 47 actual working days this year, Zhang Fengtai completed work equivalent to 80 days as stipulated by the state quota.
    Zhang Fengtai only graduated from university and came to the design institute in April 1954. Initially, his work was not only inefficient, but also often reworked due to many mistakes. With the help of Soviet experts, he gradually became more fond of his work, often using measurement methods to check his work, and then arranging his work plan according to the results obtained from the measurement. In the implementation of the work plan, he also established a work diary to check the daily completion of the plan, and timely absorbed the experience of improving work. In addition, whenever he wants to do an engineering design, he researches the plan with all relevant parties in advance, prepares all the necessary materials and tools for himself, and completes it in one go after picking up the pen. In his spare time, he also conducts technical studies around the design project he is about to undertake. In the second half of last year, his work efficiency has been significantly improved. In January of this year, he completed 40 drawings, more than twice the national quota, and the quality of the drawings was also very good. (Xinhua News Agency)

    进一步推广快速设计法
    重工业部黑色冶金设计院鞍山分院在17日下午举行的先进生产者会议上，提出进一步广泛地推广青年技术员张凤台所创造的快速设计法。
    张凤台在今年的47个实际工作日里完成了相当于国家定额所规定的80天的工作。
    1954年4月，张凤台才由大学毕业来到设计院，最初他的工作不但效率低，还常常因为错误多而返工。在苏联专家的帮助下，他逐渐地更加喜爱自己的工作，经常用测定的方法检查自己的工作情况，然后又按照测定所得出的结果编排自己的作业计划。在执行作业计划中他又建立了工作日记，检查每天完成计划的情况，及时地吸取改进工作的经验。另外每当要做一项工程设计的时候，他都事先和各有关方面把方案研究好，为自己准备好各种必须的资料和工具，提笔后就一气呵成。在业余时间他又围绕着即将担负的设计工程进行技术学习。去年下半年，他的工作效率就有了显著的提高，今年1月份完成了40张图纸，超过国家定额一倍多，图纸的质量也很好。　　（新华社）
