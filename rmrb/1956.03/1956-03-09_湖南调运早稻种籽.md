Hunan Transfers Early Rice Seeds
    Starting in early February, Hunan Province began the transfer of early rice seeds within the province. Before the Qingming Festival, it will ensure that more than 13 million jin of early rice seeds needed for expanding double-cropping rice are transported from the Xiangtan and Changde regions to the hands of farmers in western and southern Hunan.
