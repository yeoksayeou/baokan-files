The spring plowing preparation work in the cotton-producing areas of Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Hubei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Beijing and other 8 provinces and cities has been done earlier and better than in previous years. The cotton fields in these areas generally underwent autumn plowing last year, and now they are starting spring harrowing and spring irrigation. The spring harrowing and spring irrigation work in the cotton fields in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province is generally 20 days earlier than last year. Farmers in Shandong Province, where there was little rain and snow last year, are also actively working on digging wells, preparing the land, and preserving soil moisture. This year, the irrigated cotton fields in Henan Province will account for more than 70% of the province's total cotton field area. The area of irrigated cotton fields in Shanxi Province has increased to more than 1.25 million mu this year.

The manure accumulation work in the cotton-producing areas this year is also more abundant and better than in previous years, generally averaging four to five thousand jin per mu. In Hebei Province, 70% of farmers are involved in the manure accumulation campaign, and the average amount of fertilizer applied per mu has increased by 3 times compared to 1955. Farmers in Shangqiu and Xuchang areas of Henan Province did not have the habit of applying fertilizer to cotton fields in the past, but this year all cotton fields are fertilized with 5,000 jin.

This year, almost all cotton fields in various regions have adopted improved varieties. The allocation of improved varieties in various regions can basically be completed in mid-March, and can be supplied to farmers before spring plowing. Gongan County, Hubei Province, has supplied 90% of high-quality cotton seeds to farmers. Farmers in various regions are now carrying out seed selection and seed vernalization.

Various regions have also trained a large number of cotton technical personnel this year. Henan Province requires one technical backbone for every 25 mu of cotton fields, and more than 50,000 technical backbones have been trained.

    各棉产区备耕工作比往年做得好
    河北、山西、河南、湖北、山东、江苏、陕西、北京等8个省、市的棉产区的春耕准备工作都比往年做得又早又好。这些地区的棉田去年都普遍进行了秋耕，现在又开始进行春耙、春灌工作。陕西省关中地区的棉田的春耙、春灌工作，一般都比去年提早了20天。去年雨雪少的山东省农民也正积极进行打井整地保墒工作。河南省今年灌溉的棉田要占全省棉田面积70％以上。山西省今年的水浇棉田增加到125万多亩。
    今年各棉产区的积肥工作也比往年做得又多又好，一般平均每亩可达到四、五千斤。河北省70％的农民都投入积肥运动中，平均每亩施肥量比1955年增加了3倍。河南省商丘、许昌等专区的农民过去没有在棉田里施肥的习惯，今年全部棉田都施肥到5，000斤。
    今年各地棉田几乎全部采用了良种，现在各地良种调拨工作在3月中旬基本上可以结束，在春耕前都可供应到农民手中。湖北省公安县已把90％的优良棉种供应到农民手中。现在各地农民正在进行种子粒选和种子春化处理工作。
    各地今年还训练大批棉花技术手。河南省要求25亩棉田有一个技术骨干，现已训练5万多名技术骨干。
