Do Not Let Middle and Primary School Students Drop Out
    Since the autumn of 1955, the phenomenon of students dropping out or suspending their studies in middle and primary schools across the country has become increasingly serious. According to incomplete statistics from 189 middle schools in seven provinces, including Hunan, Jiangsu, Hebei, Henan, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Fujian, from the beginning of this spring semester to the end of February this year, 9,499 students dropped out or suspended their studies. In Liaoning Province, from the second half of last year to now, more than 8,300 middle school students in 39 counties and cities have dropped out or suspended their studies. The situation is similar in primary schools: According to statistics from Guangxi Province, the number of primary school students in 1955 decreased by 240,000 compared to 1953. In Heilongjiang Province, from the beginning of this year's semester to February 25th, more than 120,000 primary school students dropped out, accounting for 10% of the total number of students enrolled. Currently, the phenomenon of middle and primary school students dropping out or suspending their studies in various regions continues to develop.
    There are various reasons for student mobility. However, the current sudden increase in the phenomenon of middle and primary school students dropping out or suspending their studies is related to certain ideological problems among farmers. In recent years, the results of our labor education among middle and primary school students and farmers have led many people to begin abandoning the erroneous views of despising labor in the old society and establishing the correct view that labor is glorious. This is good. But on the other hand, we have not paid attention to publicizing the principle that laborers and their children must master culture and scientific knowledge. This has led the thinking of some farmers and young people to another extreme: since labor is glorious, and since children will still participate in labor after graduating from school, it is better to participate in labor now, why bother striving for graduation and further education? That is to say, many farmers still regard labor as opposed to culture, and still believe that labor does not require culture. With the collectivization of agricultural production, farmers' income and living standards are partly or wholly determined by the number of work points or labor days. At this time, the farmers' idea that labor does not require culture becomes prominent. If the family has a relatively shortage of labor, they are even more eager for their children to drop out of school and return home immediately to earn more work points for the family. This is the fundamental reason for the sudden increase in the phenomenon of middle and primary school students dropping out or suspending their studies.
    In addition, many agricultural production cooperatives casually pull middle and primary school students to work as accountants and work recorders in the cooperatives, and certain administrative and business departments casually mobilize and recruit middle and primary school students to participate in work, which also contributes to the dropout and suspension of studies of middle and primary school students.
    This phenomenon is very detrimental to the state's planned cultivation of talent. With the development of the country's production and construction undertakings, ordinary education and higher education need to be developed accordingly in order to improve the cultural level of the people and cultivate a sufficient number of senior technical personnel. The task of middle and primary school education is, on the one hand, to improve the cultural level of the people, and on the other hand, to send new students to universities. However, according to the current situation, not only are universities encountering serious difficulties in the shortage of student sources, but also this year's junior high school graduates cannot meet the needs of high schools, secondary normal schools, and secondary vocational schools. If the phenomenon of massive dropouts and suspensions of studies in middle and primary schools continues to develop, it will disrupt the national plan, cause chaos in school education work and waste of human and material resources, and the sources of students needed by universities in the future will be even more difficult. The cadres and senior technical personnel with a certain level of culture needed in industry, agriculture and other aspects will not be able to be solved, which is of course very detrimental to the country and the socialist cause. Therefore, taking effective methods to consolidate the existing middle and primary school students and eliminate the phenomenon of dropouts and suspensions of studies in middle and primary schools has become a very important issue at present.
    To eliminate the phenomenon of middle and primary school students dropping out or suspending their studies, we must first carry out persuasion education for farmers to change their old idea that labor does not require culture. We must make them truly understand that the purpose of middle and primary school education is to cultivate the new generation to have a certain political awareness and cultural level, have systematic basic scientific knowledge, and be able to master general production technology. This is of great importance to both the country and the future of the farmers themselves. It is completely right for middle and primary school graduates to return to their hometowns to engage in labor production if they do not go on to further education. However, if parents let their children drop out of school halfway and fail to complete a certain amount of schooling merely for temporary economic benefits, this will have a very adverse impact on agricultural production and even the entire socialist cause. It should be known that without culture, it is impossible to build a socialist society. With the technological reforms in agriculture, the application of tractors and other agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, and scientific cultivation methods, we must have a large number of people with a certain level of culture in order to smoothly master new technologies and continuously improve labor productivity. Lenin said in "The Current Tasks of the Soviet Government": "Another condition for increasing labor productivity is, first, the high level of cultural education of the people." At present, the cultural backwardness of the broad masses of working people in our country is a sharp contradiction with the socialist construction undertaking being carried out in our country. In order to solve this contradiction, our country is vigorously carrying out the movement to eliminate illiteracy and will gradually implement universal compulsory education. For the sake of the country, for themselves, and for future generations, farmers must actively support and participate in these cultural and educational activities.
    A small number of students drop out or suspend their studies because their families do lack labor. Party organizations and governments at all levels should find ways to help these students and their families who are indeed in difficulty to overcome their difficulties. The method of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China is: if the student's family has difficulty in paying for their children's schooling due to the need for investment after joining the cooperative, the cooperative should discuss and agree to advance the schooling expenses of middle and primary school students, which will be deducted during the dividend distribution; for individual cases of great difficulty, subsidies should be given as appropriate; or if the local government or agricultural cooperative proves that the case is true, methods of paying fees in installments and batches should be adopted to ensure that all middle and primary school students in the cooperative attend school on time. These methods can be used for reference by various regions. In addition to these methods, reasonably assessing and using scholarships in middle schools in various regions can also help students overcome certain difficulties.
    The phenomenon of certain administrative organs and business departments, agricultural cooperatives casually mobilizing and randomly pulling middle and primary school students to participate in work should be resolutely stopped, because this is a wrong practice that only cares about the present and does not care about the future. At present, there are still a large number of past middle and primary school graduates, demobilized soldiers and transferred soldiers, as well as intellectuals in society in various regions. If they are used well, many problems can be solved. According to a survey conducted by the Guangxi Provincial Labor Bureau in Rongxian Prefecture, there are 1,562 junior high school graduates who have not yet participated in work. If agencies, enterprises, and cooperatives need people, they should give priority to recruiting these people to participate in work. Labor departments and personnel departments in various regions should also conduct investigations and understanding of the above-mentioned personnel in society and introduce them to participate in work in a planned manner.
    The dropout and suspension of studies of middle and primary school students is a problem that urgently needs to be solved at present, and it is also a problem that can be solved. Party and Communist Youth League organizations, educational administrative departments, and schools in various regions must earnestly make efforts in the above-mentioned aspects to consolidate existing students and eliminate the phenomenon of dropout and suspension of studies. For students who have already dropped out or suspended their studies, they should also be mobilized to return to school to study as much as possible.

### 不要让中、小学生中途辍学

    不要让中、小学生中途辍学
    自1955年入秋以来，各地中、小学学生退学休学的现象日益严重起来。据湖南、江苏、河北、河南、吉林、黑龙江、福建等七省189所中学不完全的统计，从今年春季开学到二月底为止，退学休学的学生有9，499人，辽宁省三十九个县市从去年下半年到现在，中学生退学休学的达八千三百多人。小学方面也有同样情况：广西省统计，1955年小学学生比1953年减少了二十四万人，黑龙江省从今年开学到二月二十五日止，小学在校学生退学者达十二万人以上，占在校学生总数的10％。目前各地中、小学生退学休学现象仍有继续发展的趋势。
    学生的流动，有多种不同的原因。但目前中、小学生退学休学现象所以突然严重起来，是同农民中间的一些思想问题有关的。几年来我们在中、小学生中和农民中进行劳动教育的结果，使许多人开始抛弃了旧社会中轻视劳动的错误观点，树立了劳动光荣的正确观点。这是好的。但另一方面，我们却没有注意宣传劳动者及其子弟必须掌握文化、掌握科学知识的道理。这就使得一部分农民和青、少年的思想走了另一极端：既然劳动是光荣的，既然孩子从学校毕了业仍然要参加劳动，那就干脆现在参加劳动好了，何必争取毕业和升学？这就是说，许多农民至今仍然是把劳动同文化对立起来看待的，仍然认为劳动是不需要文化的。农业生产合作化了，农民的收入和生活要部分地或全部地依劳动工分或劳动日的多少而定。这时候，农民的这种劳动不需要文化的思想就突出地表现出来。如果家中劳动力比较缺少，就更加希望孩子马上退学回家，多给家庭挣点工分。这就是目前中、小学生退学休学现象突然增加的根本原因。
    另外，许多农业生产合作社随便拉中、小学生在社里当会计和记工员，某些行政企业部门随便动员和招收中、小学生参加工作，也助长了中、小学生退学休学。
    这种现象对于国家有计划地培养人材非常不利。随着国家生产建设事业的发展，普通教育和高等教育都需要相应的发展，以便提高人民群众的文化水平，并培养数量足够的高级技术人材。中、小学教育的任务，一方面是要提高人民群众的文化水平，另一方面是要为高等学校输送新生。可是，按目前情况来说，不仅高等学校遇到了学生来源不足的严重困难，而且今年应届初中毕业生也不能满足高中、中等师范、中等专业学校的需要。中、小学大量退学休学的现象如果继续发展下去，那就会打乱国家计划，造成学校教育工作的混乱和人力物力的浪费，将来高等学校所需要的学生来源也更加困难，工业农业等方面所需要的具有一定文化程度的干部和高级技术人材就会无法解决，这对于国家和社会主义事业当然是十分不利的。因此，采取有效方法巩固现有的中、小学在校学生，消除中、小学生的退学休学现象，就成为当前十分重要的问题。
    要消除中、小学生退学休学的现象，必须首先对农民进行说服教育，改变他们那种劳动不需要文化的旧思想。要使他们切实了解：中、小学教育的目的，是要培养新生一代具有一定的政治觉悟和文化水平，具有系统的科学基础知识，能够掌握一般的生产技术。这无论对国家或者对农民自身的前途，关系都十分重大。中、小学毕业生如果没有升学，回乡从事劳动生产是完全应该的。但是，如果学生家长仅仅为了暂时的经济利益而让自己的子女中途退学，不能完成一定的学业，这就会对农业生产以至整个社会主义事业发生十分不利的影响。应当知道，要建设社会主义社会，没有文化是不行的。随着农业的技术改革，拖拉机和其他农业机器、化学肥料、科学耕作方法的应用，我们必须有大量的具有一定文化程度的人，才有可能顺利地掌握新的技术，劳动生产率才有可能不断提高。列宁在“苏维埃政权的当前任务”一文中说过：“另一种提高劳动生产率的条件，第一，就是民众文化教育程度底高涨。”现在我国广大劳动人民的文化落后现象，同我国正在进行的社会主义建设事业是一个尖锐的矛盾。为了解决这个矛盾，我国正在大力开展扫除文盲运动，并将逐步实施普及义务教育。农民为了国家，为了自己，为了后代，都必须积极支持与参加这些文化教育活动。
    有少数学生是因为家庭确实缺乏劳动力而退学休学。对于这些确有困难的学生和他们的家庭，各地党组织和政府应当设法帮助他们克服困难。中共湖北省委的办法是：如果学生家庭因为入社以后需要投资而使子女就学费用发生困难，应当经过合作社讨论同意，由合作社预支中、小学生上学费用，分红时扣除；个别困难大的，酌情给以补助；或者经当地政府或农业合作社证明属实，采取分期分批交费的办法，以保证社内中、小学生一律按时就学。这些办法，各地都可以参考采用。除了这些办法以外，各地中学合理地评定和使用助学金，也可以帮助学生克服某些困难。
    某些行政机关和企业部门、农业合作社随便动员和乱拉中、小学生参加工作的现象，应当坚决制止，因为这是只顾眼前不顾将来的错误作法。目前各地还有大批过去的中、小学毕业生、复员军人和转业军人，以及社会上的知识分子，如果运用得好，是可以解决许多问题的。据广西省劳动局在容县专区所作的调查，仅未参加工作的初中毕业生就有1，562人。机关、企业、合作社如果需用人，应当尽先吸收这些人参加工作。各地劳动部门、人事部门也应当对社会上上述人员进行调查了解，有计划地介绍他们参加工作。
    中、小学学生退学休学，是目前迫切需要解决的问题，也是能够解决的问题。各地党和团的组织、教育行政部门和学校，必须认真从上述各方面进行努力，巩固现有在校学生，消除退学休学现象。对于已经退学休学的学生，也应当尽可能动员他们回校学习。
