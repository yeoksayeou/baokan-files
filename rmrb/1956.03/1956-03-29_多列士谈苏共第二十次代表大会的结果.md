    "L'Humanité" published an article by Maurice Thorez, General Secretary of the French Communist Party, discussing the results of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    Thorez said that the materials and resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU are of inestimable significance to the working people of France. He wrote: The 20th Congress of the CPSU made a profound analysis of the domestic and international situation of the Soviet Union and pointed out the prospects for the future. It is not difficult to understand the widespread influence of this Congress. Moreover, the Congress very timely clarified a number of major theoretical issues with true Leninist courage.

    Thorez pointed out that Lenin's argument about the possibility of coexistence between countries with different social systems was developed at the Congress. Thorez wrote: The Congress mentioned that the principle of peaceful coexistence between capitalist and socialist systems is completely in line with the Marxist principle that capitalism will inevitably be replaced by socialism.

    However, the advent of the victory of communism throughout the world does not rely on exporting revolution from one country to another or on issuing orders to start revolutions (which is absurd), but on the development results of internal conditions in each country, and on the establishment of the superiority of the socialist mode of production over the capitalist mode of production.

    Needless to say, communists will not compromise with capitalism in terms of ideology and program. Peaceful coexistence between countries by no means means stopping the political struggle between classes, nor does it mean they will make peace in the ideological struggle.

    When Thorez talked about the shrinking area of ​​the world exploited by capitalism and the strengthening of the socialist camp, he emphasized: The socialist system has opened up bright prospects for the people of all countries, and the idea of ​​socialism is attracting more and more people around the world every day.

    Thorez pointed out that the principle of the possibility of preventing war in modern times put forward by the 20th Congress of the CPSU is of world historical significance. He wrote: International peace forces have the strength of many major countries to rely on in the struggle against aggression, and among these countries, there are also some non-socialist countries like India that actively oppose war. This is the reality in modern history. Therefore, no matter how high the significance of this new theory put forward by the 20th Congress of the CPSU is estimated, it is not an exaggeration. This principle will promote the further development of the world's struggle for peace.

    The article then pointed out: The current French peace advocates are facing new tasks, which are: striving for disarmament, striving to consolidate and further expand international cooperation, and striving to stop colonial wars. The article said: The French working class is currently struggling to achieve the immediate cessation of the war in Algeria and the recognition of the actual existence of the Algerian nation, and this struggle is in line with the true national interests of France. Thorez continued: The tremendous changes in the world now not only create more favorable conditions for the struggle for lasting peace, but also create more favorable conditions for non-socialist countries to transition to socialism. This transition form is more diverse than in the past. Thorez pointed out that communists have never been advocates of violence. He wrote: Communists are people who protect the masses from the violence and aggression of reactionaries. It is natural for communists to prefer a less painful form of transition from one social system to another.

    Thorez mentioned the lessons of the Paris Commune, when the French bourgeoisie used bloody violence. And now, the French reactionaries are trying their best to deprive the masses of their democratic rights.

    Thorez pointed out that, for example, some people are now attempting to undermine the people's democratic rights by arbitrarily implementing reactionary electoral systems.

    The French big bourgeoisie tries every means to prevent the parliament from becoming an institution representing public opinion and a tool of the people. The French reactionaries have established a special parliament—the Senate of the Republic, which is not elected by universal suffrage. The Communist Party, representing more than a quarter of the voters, has only 5% of the seats in the Senate of the Republic.

    Thorez pointed out that the financial oligarchs and reactionary politicians are afraid of the Popular Front, so they threaten the Communists again, and even clamor to ban the Communist Party precisely when the new road to socialism is proposed. Thorez said that the facts once again prove who advocates illegal actions and violence.

    The article said: The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union pointed out that in solving the problem of the road to socialism, the main role is played by the specific conditions of each country and the historical environment of each country at that time. Thorez said that the unity of the working class and its ability to actively participate in transforming the existing system are decisive conditions for the transition to socialism in all occasions. In this regard, the workers participating in the Socialist Party should think carefully about some historical lessons. Thorez recalled that in 1945, the French Socialist Party and the Communist Party had a majority in the parliament. However, at that time, the Socialist Party rejected the Communist Party's proposal to form a government by the Socialist Party and the Communist Party.

    Thorez talked about the current situation of the French parliament. He wrote: As long as the Socialist Party and the Communist Party realize the united front of the proletariat, attract the participation of laboring peasants, all laborers, and the petty bourgeoisie in the broad Popular Front movement, they can defeat the reactionaries and can use a stable majority in the parliament to effectively change policies according to the progressive aspirations of the French people.

    Thorez said: Now there are favorable conditions to unite all the forces of the French laborers, because the Communist Party and the Socialist Party are both committed to opposing the danger of war, striving to improve the living conditions of the working class, and safeguarding democratic rights (including the right to secular education).

    The last part of Thorez's article talked about the activities of the Communist Party. Thorez wrote: The victory of the struggle for the unity of the working class largely depends on the consolidation of the Communist Party's ranks. All party organizations should vigilantly watch the development of the party, correct the mistakes in the party's work, defend the party's ideological and organizational unity, and abide by the principles of democratic centralism and free criticism. All of these are the conclusions that we, the communists, have drawn from the results of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    Thorez pointed out that due to the successful activities of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union has achieved brilliant victories in communist construction.

    Thorez continued, the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union conducted frank criticism of the shortcomings of the work of the party, administrative, and economic organs of the Soviet Union. Thorez emphasized that the Congress condemned the personality cult that violated the spirit of Marxism-Leninism.

    Thorez wrote at the end of the article: The Soviet people warmly support the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and are determined to implement these resolutions. These resolutions are of great significance to the communist parties and all working people in other countries in the world as well. Millions of French proletarians and ordinary people have gained strength, hope, and confidence from these resolutions, and they will more actively devote themselves to the struggle for peace and democracy, for the unity of the working class and the unity of people from all walks of life in the country, and to the struggle for the strength of our country and the socialist future.

### 多列士谈苏共第二十次代表大会的结果

    多列士谈苏共第二十次代表大会的结果
    “人道报”刊载了法国共产党总书记莫里斯·多列士的一篇文章，这篇文章谈论苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的结果。
    多列士说，苏共第二十次代表大会的材料和决议对法国劳动人民的意义是难以估计的。他写道：苏共第二十次代表大会对苏联的国内外局势作了深刻的分析，并且指出了今后的前景，这次代表大会的广泛影响是不难理解的。而且，代表大会十分及时地以真正的列宁式的魄力阐明了若干重大的理论问题。
    多列士指出，列宁关于社会制度不同的国家可能共处的论点在代表大会上得到了发展。多列士写道：代表大会提到，资本主义制度和社会主义制度和平共处的原则是同马克思主义关于资本主义必然被社会主义代替的原理完全符合的。
    但是，共产主义在全世界的胜利的到来，不是靠把革命从一个国家向其他国家输出或是靠下命令来掀起革命（这样做是荒谬的），而是靠每一个国家内部条件的发展结果，靠社会主义生产方式确立它对资本主义生产方式的优越性。
    不用说，共产党人并不会在意识形态和纲领方面同资本主义妥协。各国和平共处绝不意味着停止阶级之间的政治斗争，也不意味着它们在意识形态的斗争中媾和。
    多列士谈到世界上受资本主义剥削的地区缩小和社会主义阵营加强这个问题的时候着重说：社会主义制度为世界各国人民开辟了光辉的前景，社会主义的思想吸引着全世界一天比一天多的广大人民群众。
    多列士指出，苏共第二十次代表大会提出的、关于现代防止战争的可能性的原理，是具有世界历史意义的。他写道：国际和平力量在反对侵略的斗争中有许多大国的实力可以作为依靠，在这些国家中，也有像印度这样一些积极反对战争的非社会主义国家。现代历史中的现实情况就是这样。因此，对于苏共第二十次代表大会提出的这个新理论的意义，是怎样估计也不会过高的。这个原理将促进世界争取和平的斗争的进一步发展。
    文章接着指出：目前的法国和平拥护者面临着新的任务，这些任务是：争取裁军，争取巩固和进一步扩大国际合作以及争取停止殖民战争等。文章说：法国工人阶级目前正在为达到立即停止阿尔及利亚的战火和承认阿尔及利亚国家的实际存在的目的而斗争，这种斗争是符合法国的真正民族利益的。多列士接着说：全世界的巨大变化现在不仅为争取持久和平的斗争创造了更加有利的条件，而且为非社会主义国家过渡到社会主义创造了更加有利的条件。这个过渡形式比起过去是更加多种多样了。多列士指出，共产党人向来就不是暴力的拥护者。他写道：共产党人是保护人民群众去反对反动派的暴力和侵略的人。共产党人宁愿选择痛苦较少的、从一种社会制度过渡到另一种社会制度的形式，这是很自然的。
    多列士提到巴黎公社的教训，当时法国的资产阶级使用了血腥的暴力。而现在，法国反动派又竭力想要剥夺人民群众的民主权利。
    多列士指出，例如有人现在正在企图用专横地实行反动的选举制度的办法来损害人民的民主权利。
    法国大资产阶级想尽种种办法来阻挠议会成为代表民意的机构和人民的工具。法国反动派建立了特殊的议院——共和国参议院，它不是由普选产生的，代表着四分之一以上的选民的共产党在共和国参议院中只有5％的席位。
    多列士指出，金融寡头和反动政治家害怕人民阵线，因此他们又对共产党人进行威胁，甚至恰恰在提出向社会主义过渡的新道路的问题的时候叫嚣要禁止共产党。多列士说，事实又一次证明是谁主张采取非法行动和暴力。
    文章说：苏联共产党第二十次代表大会指出，在解决向社会主义过渡的道路的问题的时候，起主要作用的是每个国家的具体条件和每个国家当时的历史环境。多列士说，工人阶级的统一、它为了改造现有制度而积极活动的能力，在一切场合下都是过渡到社会主义的具有决定意义的条件。在这方面，参加社会党的工人应该好好地想一想一些历史教训。多列士追述说，1945年，法国社会党和共产党在议会占多数，但是，当时社会党拒绝了共产党关于由社会党和共产党组织政府的建议。
    多列士谈到法国议会当前的情况，他写道：社会党和共产党只要使无产阶级的统一战线实现，吸引劳动农民、一切劳动者、小资产阶级参加广泛的人民阵线运动，就可以使反动派失败，就可以利用议会中的稳定多数来按照法国人民的进步愿望有效地改变政策。
    多列士说：现在具备有利的环境来团结法国劳动者的一切力量，因为共产党和社会党都在致力于反对战争危险、争取改善工人阶级的生活条件、维护民主权利（包括受非宗教教育的权利）。
    多列士的文章的最后一部分谈到共产党的活动问题。多列士写道：争取工人阶级团结的斗争的胜利，在很大程度上取决于共产党队伍的巩固。一切党组织都应当警惕地注视着党的发展，纠正党的工作中的错误，保卫党在思想上和组织上的统一，遵守民主集中制和自由批评的原则。所有这些，就是我们，共产党人，从苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的成果中得出来的结论。
    多列士指出，由于苏联共产党成功的活动，苏联已经在共产主义建设中获得了光辉的胜利。
    多列士接着说，苏联共产党第二十次代表大会对苏联的党以及行政和经济机关的工作缺点进行了坦率的批评。多列士强调指出，代表大会谴责了违反马克思列宁主义精神的个人崇拜。
    多列士在文章的结尾写道：苏联人民热烈拥护苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的决议，并且对实现这些决议抱有坚定的决心。这些决议对世界上其他国家的共产党人和一切劳动人民同样具有重大意义。千百万法国无产者和普通人民都从这些决议中获得了力量、希望和信心，他们将更加积极地投入争取和平和民主、争取工人阶级的团结和全国各阶层人民的团结的斗争，投入争取我们国家的强大和社会主义前途的斗争。
