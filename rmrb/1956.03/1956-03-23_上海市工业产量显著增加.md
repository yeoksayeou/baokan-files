Shanghai's industrial production has been remarkably active in the first quarter of this year, due to the surge in demand for goods in rural areas. It is estimated that the value of Shanghai's local industrial output in the first quarter has reached its highest historical level.

    Shanghai's heavy industry, due to the large-scale manufacturing of agricultural machinery, saw its output value increase by 13.02% in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The textile industry, benefiting from the abundant supply of raw materials due to last year's bumper cotton harvests in various rural areas, also saw its output value increase by 8.16% in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of last year.

    The quantity of goods purchased by various rural areas from Shanghai this year has increased significantly compared to the past. For mimeograph machines, various regions requested a total of 20,000 units in the first quarter. The demand for magneto telephones, low-voltage magnetic bottles, lightning arresters, vacuum tubes, and other items has generally increased by two to twenty-eight times compared to the past. Various regions have also requested Shanghai to supply a large number of medical devices. Shandong Province requested to purchase 670,000 rural health kits, and Jiangsu Province requested 35,000 units. Currently, Shanghai workers are stepping up production to meet the needs of various regions.

    上海市工业产量显著增加
    由于农村需要商品数量的激增，上海市今年第一季度的工业生产显得异常活跃。据估算，上海市地方工业第一季度的产值已经达到历史上的最高水平。
    上海市的重工业由于大量制造农业机械，今年第一季度的产值比去年第四季度增加了13.02％。纺织工业因为去年各地农村棉花丰收，原料充足，今年第一季度的产值也比去年第四季度增加8.16％。
    今年各地农村向上海购买货物的数量比过去增加很多。油印机，各地在第一季度共要货二万架。磁石电话、低压磁瓶、避雷器、真空管等的要货数量，一般也都比过去增加两倍到二十八倍。各地还要求上海供应大批医药器械。山东省要购买农村用的保健箱六十七万只，江苏省也要三万五千只。目前，上海工人们正在为满足各地的需要而加紧生产。
