    Actively Learn from Advanced Workers
    Workers at the Jiangxi Textile Factory are enthusiastically engaging in a production competition in order to strive to complete the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule. Workers with poorer skills have successively proposed to learn from advanced workers. The picture shows fine yarn worker Wu Guilan (right) learning the "roving package splicing method" from advanced worker Shi Zuoyu.

    积极向先进工人学习
    江西纺织厂的工人们，为争取提前一年完成五年计划，热烈展开了生产竞赛。技术较差的工人，纷纷提出要向先进工人学习。图为细纱工人吴桂兰（右）在向先进工人施作宇学习“粗纱包拈接头法”。
