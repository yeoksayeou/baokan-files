    Completing Five Years' Worth of Work Ahead of Schedule
    Li Yongshun, a model worker and milling machine operator at the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, completed five years' worth of work ahead of schedule on February 29th. About 70% of the workpieces he milled were A-grade precision boring tools. For the past three years and two months, the average quality of the products he milled has reached over 98%.
    Six workers from the No. 2 workshop of the Fuxin Mining Bureau General Machinery Plant, operating the new No. 2 planer and the five-meter lathe, have completed five years' worth of work more than 1 year and 10 months ahead of schedule. These six workers are Ma Bingxin, Liu Diankui, Zhu Zhixin, Wu Qingrong, Bao Fengwu, and Lü Zhongxin. A key characteristic of their production is using their brains and improving various fixtures and tools, resulting in a general increase in efficiency by one to seven times.
