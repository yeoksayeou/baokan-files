    Lhasa Domestic Goods Exhibition Closes

    The domestic goods exhibition held in Lhasa closed on the 17th. Over seventeen days, the exhibition received 37,000 visitors, including officials from the Tibetan local government, lamas, farmers, herdsmen, merchants, and city residents. More than 1,000 visitors wrote down their thoughts in the exhibition's guest book, expressing gratitude to the motherland for its support to the Tibetan people and praising the good quality and low prices of domestic goods. Farmers were particularly interested in the new-style walking plows, and herdsmen were particularly interested in medicines and equipment for treating and preventing livestock diseases.
