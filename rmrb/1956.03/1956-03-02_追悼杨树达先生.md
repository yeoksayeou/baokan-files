    In Memory of Mr. Yang Shuda
    Yang Bojun, Associate Professor, Department of Chinese Language, Peking University
    Mr. Yang Yufu (Shuda) passed away at 2:30 AM on February 14th at the Affiliated Hospital of Hunan Medical College in Changsha due to hypertension and gastrointestinal bleeding. For me, losing a beloved uncle and respected mentor is a source of immense grief. For the country, the loss of an outstanding scholar who could have made even greater contributions is an especially significant blow.
    He was born in 1885. In his childhood, he studied traditional Chinese books with my grandfather. At that time, the promotion of new learning was underway. Our family was extremely poor then, unable to afford new books, so he and my father borrowed and copied books everywhere, studying diligently on their own. Soon after, he was admitted to the Shiwu (Current Affairs) Academy. In 1905, he went to Japan to study. In 1911, he hastily returned to China due to the Xinhai Revolution. From then on, he dedicated his life to education and academic work. Initially, he taught in middle schools in Changsha. After coming to Beijing in 1920, he began teaching at universities, successively serving as a professor at Beijing Normal University, Tsinghua University, and other institutions. He taught tirelessly and read tirelessly. Whenever he studied a subject, he always strived to make greater achievements creatively based on the existing accomplishments of his predecessors. He was a person who read with purpose and made contributions. As early as seventeen or eighteen years old, when he began reading the "Book of Changes," he compiled the book "Ancient Meanings of the Book of Changes." Subsequently, he compiled "Ancient Meanings of Lao Tzu" and "Ancient Meanings of the Analects" using the same method. In recent years, he expanded "Ancient Meanings of the Analects" into "Scholarly Examination of the Analects." When he engaged in teaching, he was adept at combining scientific research and teaching. This not only improved the quality of teaching, but the number of people who benefited from each book he published was many times greater than the number of students he personally taught. When he first taught Chinese grammar in Changsha, he began writing "Corrections to Ma's Grammar." When he taught ancient Chinese grammar in Beijing, he wrote "Advanced Chinese Grammar" and "Ci Quan" (A Dictionary of Particles), summarizing and creatively enriching the research achievements on ancient Chinese particles since Liu Qi and Wang Niansun. When he taught rhetoric, he successively wrote books such as "Examples and Supplements to Doubtful Cases in Ancient Books" and "Rhetoric of Classical Chinese." When he taught ancient texts, he produced the book "Examples of Punctuation and Interpretation of Ancient Books." When he taught "Huainanzi," he wrote "Textual Research on Huainanzi." When he taught "Book of Han," he wrote "A Study of Marriage and Funeral Customs in the Han Dynasty." These books have all been highly regarded by academic circles at home and abroad. In his later years, he specialized in philology, concentrating his efforts on etymology and paleography. Regarding oracle bone inscriptions, he was one of the later scholars to begin studying them in over 50 years, but he was the one who published the most papers and was also recognized as the most diligent. His important papers have been compiled into books such as "Collected Explanations of Bronze Inscriptions from the J微居 Studio," "Collected Explanations of Oracle Bone Inscriptions from the J微居 Studio," "Scholarly Notes on Elementary Philology from the J微居 Studio," and "Collected Essays on Philology and Epigraphy from the J微居 Studio." He was able to integrate oracle bone inscriptions, bronze inscriptions, ancient literature, and ancient history, thus achieving brilliant success. At the same time, he studied the "Book of Han" for thirty or forty years, summarizing his work in his later years and writing the book "Glimpses into the Book of Han." His students are scattered throughout the country, and his works have received high praise from experts at home and abroad.
    His works are not only numerous but also of high quality. Many of his papers contain insightful views, meticulous care, and rigorous arguments, resolving long-standing doubts, settling many disputes, and opening up avenues for research. Why was he able to do so? Some say he read extensively, was familiar with ancient books, and was meticulous. However, these are not the main reasons. The main reasons are: a pragmatic approach and a consistently unremitting spirit.
    He never engaged in anything like Hu Shi's "bold hypotheses" (which were actually just subjective assumptions) and "careful verifications" (which were actually just one-sided verifications). He started with in-depth research and exploration of objective laws, then applied these laws to solve practical problems, thereby discovering new laws and enriching his understanding. He called objective laws "regulations." Take his research on paleography as an example. In the preface to "Scholarly Notes on Elementary Philology from the J微居 Studio," he said: "From this general outline, I derived several regulations. First, the phonetic component in phonetic-semantic characters often has meaning. Second, the phenomenon of mutual borrowing and substitution existed from the very beginning of character construction. Third, characters with the same meaning often have the same or similar structures. Fourth, characters belonging to the four categories of pictographs, ideographs, associative compounds, and phonetic-semantic characters often have later added radical characters. ... Fifth, characters belonging to the three categories of pictographs, ideographs, and associative compounds often have later phonetic-semantic characters." These regulations are actually the objective laws of character construction and development and change. Moreover, we can see the intrinsic connection between the form, sound, and meaning of characters from the laws he discovered. In the past, people separated the form, sound, and meaning of characters and studied them separately, which inevitably limited their achievements. His research on philology, although inheriting from the Qing Dynasty scholars Duan Yucai and Wang Niansun, has greatly surpassed Duan Yucai and Wang Niansun in its achievements. This has been generally recognized by experts. In scientific research, he can be said to be a spontaneous materialist.
    His consistently unremitting spirit is even more worth learning from. Unless he was so ill that he had to lie down, he never stopped learning for a single day. He kept a diary, and had not missed a single day for decades. He believed that even five or ten minutes were valuable, and that even a little bit of insight was precious. He believed that an impressive quantity is accumulated from small amounts, and that quality and quantity have a dialectical relationship. Therefore, he named his study "J微居" (Studio of Accumulating the Minute). He was not only consistently unremitting, but also grew stronger as he got older. He himself was happy to have caught up with the times. The strength and prosperity of China after liberation, the support and encouragement from the Party and the government, especially Chairman Mao's greatness and his earnest concern for him, not only made him grateful, but also inspired him. In his later years, he participated in some social activities, often regretting that "his eyes and ears were failing, and his movements were inconvenient." He could not attend the two National People's Political Consultative Conferences due to poor health, and always wrote to tell me that he was "deeply sorry." But he worked even harder on his writing, determined to "serve the country with his writings." When he came to Beijing last September and October, he not only identified the research topic "Explanations of Current Language in Shuowen Jiezi" at the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, but also identified the research topic "Annotation of Salt and Iron Discourses" at the Institute of Philosophy. After returning to Changsha, he worked even more selflessly. The "Annotation of Salt and Iron Discourses" was originally scheduled to be submitted in one year, but the first draft was completed in just 50 days, waiting only to be refined. At the same time, he began to study "Yanzi Chunqiu," writing to me to copy and send him materials. In early February of this year, his gastrointestinal bleeding recurred, and he initially refused to rest. It was not until three days before his death that he listened to the doctor's and family's firm requests and completely rested in bed. This kind of selfless working spirit is naturally also a manifestation of high patriotism.
    Mr. Yufu has passed away! An old Chinese saying goes, "It is rare for people to live to seventy." He lived to 71, which seems to be without regret. However, this old saying should be re-evaluated today. Before liberation, he did not expect to live to 70. Especially in 1942, when he was in Changxi, Hunan, so poor that his children could not attend school, and he himself suffered from malnutrition and severe insomnia, he thought he would not live long, and even wrote his will. After liberation, it was completely the opposite. He thought he could live to eighty or ninety, and therefore strived to make more efforts in academics in his remaining years. He also made a grand wish to systematically reorganize all the philosophers of the Zhou and Qin dynasties. In this way, 71 years was indeed too short for him!

    追悼杨树达先生
    北京大学中文系副教授　杨伯峻
    杨遇夫（树达）先生于2月14日上午二时半因高血压症，消化道出血逝世于长沙湖南医学院附属医院。这对我来说，丧失了亲爱的叔父，尊敬的导师，自然万分哀痛。对国家来说，少了一位出色的、而且能够作出更大贡献的学者，尤其是巨大的损失。
    他生于1885年，幼小时随着我祖父读中国旧书。那时正提倡新学。当时我们家里极穷，买不起新书，他便和我父亲两个到处借书抄写，刻苦自学。不久，考进了时务学堂。1905年去日本留学。1911年，因为辛亥革命，匆忙回国。从此便把毕生的事业建筑在教育和学术工作上。最初在长沙教中学，1920年来北京以后开始教大学。先后任北京师范大学、清华大学等校教授。1937年回到湖南，任湖南大学、湖南师范学院教授。他不知疲倦地教书，不知疲倦地读书。他每研究一门学问，一定要在前人已有成果的基础上创造性地做出更大的成绩来。他是善于有目的地、有贡献地读书的人。还只十七八岁的时候，开始读“周易”，便辑录了“周易古义”一书。其后又用同样的方法辑录出“老子古义”和“论语古义”。近年又把“论语古义”扩大为“论语疏证”。当他从事教学的时候，又善于把科学研究和教学结合起来。不但提高了教学质量，而且每出版一本书，得他益处的人数要比他所亲自口授的学生数不知多若干倍。他在长沙最初教中国文法，便开始写“马氏文通刊误”。在北京教古汉语语法，便著作了“高等国文法”、“词诠”两书，总结了而且创造性地丰富了自刘淇、王念孙以来对古书虚词的研究成绩。教修辞学，便陆续写了“古书疑例举例续补”、“汉文文言修辞学”诸书。教古代文，便有“古书句读释例”一书。教“淮南子”，便有“淮南子证闻”。教“汉书”，便有“汉代婚丧礼俗考”。这些书籍，都得到国内外学术界的重视。晚年专讲文字学，自己也集中精力作语源学和古文字学的研究。以甲骨文而论，50多年以来，他是开始研究较晚的一人，却是发表论文最多的人，也被公认为最努力的一人。他的重要论文已经汇编为“积微居金文说”、“积微居甲文说”、“积微居小学述林”、“积微居小学金石论丛”诸书。他能把甲骨金文和古代文献古代历史融会贯通起来，所以取得了辉煌的成就。同时，他研究“汉书”三四十年，晚年自己作了总结，写完“汉书窥管”一书。他的学生遍布国内，他的著作得到了国内外专家们很高的评价。
    他的著作不但数量多，而且质量高。很多论文见解精到，用心细密，论证谨严，曾解决了多年的疑难，判定了多人的争论，开辟了研究的道路。为什么能如此呢？有人说他看书多，古书熟，用心细。然而，这都不是主要的。主要的是：实事求是的方法，始终不懈的精神。
    他从来不像胡适之流那样，搞什么“大胆的假设”（其实只是主观的假设）“小心的求证”（其实只是片面的求证）。他从深入钻研，探讨客观规律着手，然后运用规律以解决实际问题，从而再发现新的规律，丰富自己的认识。他把客观规律唤做“条例”。举他的古文字学的研究为例。他在“积微居小学述林”自序中说：“由此总纲推衍，我得条例若干条。一曰形声字中声旁往往有义。二曰文字构造之初已有彼此相通假的现象。三曰意义相同的字，他的构造往往相同或相类。四曰象形、指事、会意、形声四书的字往往有后起的加旁字。……五曰象形、指事、会意三书的字往往有后起的形声字。”这些条例，其实就是文字构造和发展、变化的客观规律。而且，我们从他所发现的规律中还可以看出文字的形体、声音和意义的内在连系。从前人都把文字的形体、声音和意义割裂开来，分别研究，因之不能不使他们的成就带着很大的局限性。他对文字学的研究，虽说继承着清代学者段玉裁、王念孙而来，而其所得成果实已大大超越段玉裁、王念孙。这一点已为专家们所公认。他在科学研究上，可以说是一个自发的唯物主义者。
    他的始终不懈的精神更是值得学习的。除非病到非躺下来不可，他没有一天停止过学问。他记日记，几十年了，没有一天间断过。他认为就是五分钟，十分钟的时间都是可贵的；就是点滴的心得也是难能的。他认为可观的数量是由细小积累起来的，质量和数量是有其辩证的关系的。因此，他把自己的书房号做“积微居”。他不但始终不懈，而且老当益壮。他自己高兴赶上了时代。解放后的中国的强大和繁荣，党和政府对他的支持和鼓励，尤其是毛主席的伟大和对他殷切的关怀，不但使他感激，而且使他振奋。他晚年参加了一些社会活动，经常自恨“耳目不灵，行动不便”。两次的全国政协会议都因身体不好而不能参加，总写信告诉我说“心甚歉然”。但却更加努力地著书，立志以“著述报国”。去年九、十月间到北京来，既在中国科学院语言研究所认定了研究题目：“说文今语疏证”，又在哲学研究所认定了研究题目：“盐铁论校注”。回长沙以后，更是忘我地工作。“盐铁论校注”本来约定一年交稿，哪知仅仅50天便把初稿完成，只待加工了。同时又开始研究“晏子春秋”，写信要我替他抄寄材料。今年2月初，他的消化道出血的病复发，最初还不肯休息。一直到临死前3天，才听医生和家人的坚决要求，完全卧床静养。这一种忘我地工作的精神，自然也是高度的爱国主义的表现。
    遇夫先生与世长辞了！中国的老话说，“人生七十古来稀”，他活到71岁，似乎是可以无憾的。但是，这句老话今天应该重新估价。他在解放前，是料不到能活到70岁的。尤其在1942年，他在湖南长溪，穷得儿女失学，自己营养不够，得着严重的失眠症，以为活不了多久，甚至把遗嘱都写下来了。解放以后，便完全相反，自己以为能活到八、九十岁，因此争取于余年中在学术上更多地尽些力量。他还发下弘愿，要把周秦诸子全部地有系统地重新整理一遍。这样，71岁的确对他太少了！
