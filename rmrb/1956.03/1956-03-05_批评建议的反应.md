    Responses to Criticism and Suggestions
    A letter from the Business Bureau of the Ministry of Railways: The criticisms of railway transportation work raised in the two readers' letters, "Eliminate Oil Leakage Accidents During Transportation" and "Whose Responsibility Is This Anyway?" in the "Readers' Letters" column on December 25, 1955, are correct. We have already forwarded the situation reflected in the readers' letters to the relevant railway administrations for inspection and have taken improvement measures.

    A letter from Lishui Forestry School, Zhejiang Province: The "Readers' Letters" column on December 18, 1955, made a serious criticism of the phenomenon of waste in our school, which we sincerely accept. Under the leadership of the local Party committee, we conducted an inspection and gave due punishment to those who were derelict in their duties. In addition, we have also taken measures to dispose of stockpiled materials and have established various systems for the execution of financial expenditures.
