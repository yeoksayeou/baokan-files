How We Organize Production and Manage Finances
Geng Changsuo, Director of Wugong Township Agricultural Production Cooperative, Raoyang County, Hebei Province

        Organization of Production Teams
    After our agricultural production cooperative expanded into a large cooperative, we lacked experience in the organization of production teams, and we changed them every year for several years. Frequent changes in production teams are indeed not beneficial. It not only affects the emotions of the members and is not conducive to increased production, but also increases a lot of affairs for the leadership. So, why did we change it every year? When we first started dividing production teams, we only cared about immediate convenience and formed teams based on the original small cooperatives. Small cooperatives with few households were counted as one team, and large cooperatives were also counted as one team. The entire cooperative was divided into 13 teams. Later, we realized that this was not suitable for the needs of production. The teams were too small, making it difficult to lead and not suitable for mechanized farming; the teams were too numerous, dispersing the leadership backbone; the labor force between the teams was unbalanced, making it unsuitable for contracting work and output. Therefore, before the start of production in 1954, we had to change the original production teams from 13 to 11. Last year, we changed it again. The main reason for this change was the imbalance of leadership backbone. The Fourth Team had a weak leadership backbone, and production had declined for two consecutive years. The members of this team requested to "jump to another team." After the adjustment, it was divided into 10 production teams.
    Over the years, we have learned from experience in the establishment of production teams that the unit of production teams should not be too small. In our plain areas, under the current production conditions, it is appropriate to have 40 to 50 households per team. When establishing production teams, it is necessary to ensure that the labor force between the teams is roughly balanced, and that the elderly, weak, widowed, and orphaned households are evenly distributed. The most important thing is to allocate the backbone forces well. Last year, when we rectified the organization of the production teams, we transferred Li Shuxiang, the captain of the Seventh Team, to the Sixth Team as the deputy captain in charge of political work. The Sixth Team used to be a backward team; after the rectification, it changed its appearance, and all work could be completed ahead of schedule. The organization of production teams should strive to be appropriate and minimize changes, as one change is very troublesome and detrimental to production.
        Division of Cultivated Areas
    We have changed the cultivated areas for two consecutive years. The main reason for the change is that in the division of cultivated areas, we only took into account the concentration of land for easy management, with one team operating only one piece of land, while violating the principle of "adapting to local conditions." Most of the cultivated area of the First Team is white soil, which is only suitable for growing peanuts and sweet potatoes; however, if only these two crops are grown, there will inevitably be an imbalance in labor. Therefore, they had to grow some millet as well. As a result, they sowed three or four times before preserving the seedlings. The land distributed to the Third Team was mostly red soil, but they also planted some peanuts; as a result, not only was the yield very low, but also because the soil was hard, they lost a lot when digging, and wasted a lot of labor. Because each team needed to plant various crops in its own cultivated area, the large cultivated areas were divided into scattered plots, so that the crops could not be concentrated and were not suitable for mechanized farming. In addition, because the land allocated to each team varied in terrain and soil quality, the teams suffered vastly different disasters in the previous two years, with some "crying and some laughing," and the income distribution between the teams was unreasonable. In order to solve this problem, we grasped the principle of "adapting to local conditions, benefiting production, and adapting to mechanized farming" and re-divided the cultivated areas. The method of division is: according to the land distribution of the entire cooperative, the land is divided into several large plots according to soil quality, and each plot is further divided into several small areas, which are allocated to several production teams for operation. A production team must operate several small areas in several large plots separately. This method of dividing large plots into small areas has several advantages: first, it can be planted according to local conditions; second, it can solve the problem of uneven soil quality and terrain between teams; third, it can concentrate crops on large plots according to crop categories, making them suitable for mechanized farming; fourth, it facilitates competition between teams.
          Financial Contract System
    In the early days of the cooperative, we lacked experience in property management, and expenses were chaotic. A few leaders of the management committee were in charge, and there was no overall plan that had been democratically discussed and approved by the members regarding what to spend and how much to spend. Egalitarianism was still quite serious. If this team received a whip, other teams would also receive one even if they already had one. There were even more problems in the allocation of livestock and farm implements. This team complained that the livestock was small, and that team complained that the livestock was weak; this team wanted to exchange livestock, and that team wanted to exchange farm implements. In order to eliminate this chaotic phenomenon, we implemented a financial contract system. The specific method is: the livestock and farm implements used by the entire cooperative are calculated according to value and allocated to each team according to the average land area; afterwards, the increase or decrease in the value of livestock and farm implements is the responsibility of each team. Each year, the management committee pays each team a certain amount of depreciation fees for farm implements, feed, fodder, farm implement repair fees, and miscellaneous expenses (including the cost of buying lamp oil, paper, rope, whips, etc.), and also stipulates a uniform quota, which is uniformly paid by the management committee according to the amount of land managed by each team. Surpluses or deficiencies are handled by the teams themselves.
    After the implementation of this method, the chaotic phenomenon in finance was overcome, waste was avoided, and expenses were saved. In the past, each team would rather use leather straps than hemp ropes, and replace the rope loops with new ones when they broke; now they save leather straps and use hemp ropes, and try to mend the rope loops when they break. The sense of responsibility of each team for the management and care of livestock and farm implements has been strengthened.

    我们怎样组织生产和管理财务
    河北省饶阳县五公乡农业生产合作社主任　耿长锁
        生产队的组织
    我们的农业生产合作社扩建成大社以后，在生产队的组织方面，因为没有经验，几年来总是一年变动一次。经常变动生产队，确实是没有好处的。既影响社员们的情绪，不利于增产，又增加领导方面的好多事务。那末，为什么年年要变动呢？第一年开始划生产队时，只顾眼前省事，按原小社的基础编队，原小社户数少的算一队，户数多的也算一队，全社编了13个队。到后来，才了解到这样做不适应生产的需要。队太小，不便于领导，不适应机耕；队多，领导骨干分散；队和队之间的劳动力不平衡，不适应包工包产的需要。因此，在1954年开始生产前，不得不变动原来的生产队，由13个队改为11个队。去年，又变动了一次。这次变动的主要原因，是领导骨干不平衡。第四队由于领导骨干弱，连续二年减产，这个队的社员们要求“跳队”。调整了以后，划分为10个生产队。
    几年以来，在编制生产队方面，我们体会到：生产队的单位，不宜太小，在我们这样的平原地区，在目前的生产条件下，以每队40到50户为宜。在编制生产队的时候，要做到队和队之间的劳动力大体平衡，并把老弱孤寡户搭配均匀，最重要的是把骨干力量搭配好。去年我们在整顿生产队的组织的时候，把第七队的队长李书香调到第六队当负责政治工作的副队长；第六队过去一贯是落后队；经过整顿后，变了样，一切工作都能提前完成。生产队的组织应力求恰当，尽量少变动，改变一次很麻烦，对生产也不利。
        耕作区的划分
    我们连着两年都变动了耕作区。变动的主要原因是：在划分耕作区当中，只照顾了土地集中，便于经营，一队只经营一片，而违背了“因地制宜”的原则。第一队的耕作区内大部分是白土，只适合种花生和甘薯；可是，都种这两种作物，就必然在劳力上产生忙闲不均的现象。因此，他们只得也种一部分谷子。结果，播种三、四次，才保全了苗。第三队分的地多是红土地，却也种了一部分花生；结果，不但产量很低，还因为土质硬，在刨的时候丢了很多，还浪费了很多工。由于各队都需要在自己的耕作区里种植各种作物，就把大块的耕作区分割成了零碎的地块，使作物不能集中，不适应机耕。另外，由于各队分到的土地地势、土质好坏不均，所以各队前二年受灾悬殊，“哭的哭，笑的笑”，队和队之间收益分配不合理。为了解决这个问题，我们掌握“因地制宜、有利生产、适应机耕”的原则，重新划分了耕作区。划分的方法是：根据全社的土地分布情况，按着土质分为若干大片，每片再分成几个小区，搭配给几个生产队经营，一个生产队要在几个大片内分别经营几个小区。这种大片套小区的划分方法，有这样几个好处：第一，能够因地种植；第二，能够解决队和队之间土质、地势好坏不均的问题；第三，能够按着作物类别，在大块土地上，统一种植，使作物集中，便于机耕；第四，便于队和队之间开展竞赛。
          财务包干制
    建社初期，在财产管理上缺乏经验，开支混乱。管委会少数领导人员当家，开支什么，开支多少，没有一个经过社员民主讨论通过的全盘的计划。平均主义思想还相当严重，这队领了一把鞭子，别的队本来有鞭子也要领。在搭配牲口农具上，问题更多。这队嫌牲口小，那队嫌牲口弱；这队要换牲口，那队要换农具。为了消除这种混乱现象，我们实行了财务包干制。具体办法是：把全社所用牲口、农具按价值计算，按照土地平均搭配给各队；以后牲口农具增值减值，都由各队各自负责。每年由管委会付给各队一定的农具折旧费、饲料、饲草、农具修理费和杂项开支（包括买灯油、纸张、绳子、鞭子等的费用），也规定出统一的定额，按照各队经管的土地多少，由管委会统一支付，节余或不足由各队自己负责处理。
    实行这种办法以后，克服了财务上的混乱现象，避免了浪费，节省了开支。过去，各队都是有麻绳不用领皮条，绳套断了换新的；现在是省着皮条用麻绳，绳套断了想法接。各队对牲口、农具经管爱护的责任心加强了。
