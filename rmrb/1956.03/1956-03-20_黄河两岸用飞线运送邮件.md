    Using Flying Lines to Transport Mail Across the Yellow River

    Between Baotou and Darat Banner on the banks of the Yellow River in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, "flying lines" (i.e., steel cables) have been erected to transport mail, solving the problem of not being able to transport mail during the annual Yellow River freeze-up period. Since the Yellow River began to be closed to traffic on March 5th this year, a large number of documents, newspapers, and magazines, and postal packages weighing less than three kilograms have been successfully transported to the other side via the flying lines.

    黄河两岸用飞线运送邮件
    内蒙古自治区境内黄河两岸的包头和达拉特旗之间，架设“飞线”（即钢索）运送邮件，解决了历年来在黄河封冻期间不能运送邮件的问题。从今年三月五日黄河开始禁渡以来，大批文件、报刊和三公斤以下的邮包，通过飞线顺利地运到了对岸。
