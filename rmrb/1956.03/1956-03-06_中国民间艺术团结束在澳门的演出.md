Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 5th. The Chinese Folk Art Troupe concluded its performances in Macau on the 4th. The troupe gave 29 performances, with an audience of over 40,000.

    From the moment the art troupe arrived in Macau, it became the center of conversation, with people queuing day and night at the ticket office.

    On the evening of the final performance, Zhang Wenyuan, a sailor from Fujian on the Indian ship "Imery House," made a special trip from Hong Kong upon hearing that the Chinese Folk Art Troupe was performing in Macau. However, the tickets were sold out, so he stood at the entrance of the Qingping Theater and said, "If I can't see the performance, I'll be happy just standing at the door, listening to the songs of the motherland and waiting for the actors of the art troupe to come out and take a look." He was overjoyed when he was allowed to see the art troupe's performance.

    During the art troupe's performances, the records of "Singing the Motherland" sold by the record company and the pictures of "Lotus Dance" and other items in local bookstores were all sold out.

    中国民间艺术团结束在澳门的演出
    据新华社广州5日电  中国民间艺术团4日结束在澳门的演出。艺术团共演出29场，观众达4万多人次。
    从艺术团到达澳门以后，人们就把它作为谈论的中心，售票处日夜都有人排队购票。
    在结束演出的当晚，有个福建籍的印度“意美利厚”号轮船海员张文元，他听到中国民间艺术团在澳门演出，就特地从香港赶来。可是票已卖光，他就站在清平戏院门口说：“没有办法看演出，就站在门口听听祖国的歌声和等候艺术团的演员出来看看也幸福了。”当他得到允许可以看到艺术团的演出的时候，他高兴极了。
    艺术团在演出期间，唱片公司出售的“歌唱祖国”的唱片和当地书店的“荷花舞”等画片都全部卖光了。
