Commemorating the Fifth Anniversary of the Founding of the Vietnam Workers' Party
Member of the Central Executive Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party, Nguyen Duy Trinh

    March 3rd marks the fifth anniversary of the founding of the Vietnam Workers' Party and also the 26th anniversary of the struggle of the Indochinese Communist Party.
    This day is a day of great joy for our entire party and also a day of great joy for all the people of Vietnam.
    From 1930 to today, the Vietnamese working class and its vanguard have consistently led the Vietnamese people in resolutely struggling for national independence, democracy, freedom, and happiness.
    Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Executive Committee headed by Comrade Ho Chi Minh, the Party has always been the guiding light for the advancement of the Vietnamese revolution.
    When the Vietnamese people had just achieved victory in 1945, the French colonialists, with the support of other imperialists, turned around and invaded Vietnam. Believing in the inexhaustible combat power of the people, the Party resolutely led the people in a prolonged and comprehensive war of resistance to defend and develop the victory of the August Revolution. Surrounded on all sides by imperialists, resisting a professional colonial invading army, the Party and the entire nation accepted an unprecedentedly severe test. In the early years, we repeatedly defeated the enemy's offensives, maintaining and consolidating the base areas of the war of resistance. In 1950, the entire mainland of China was liberated, and the Vietnam Border Campaign achieved victory. The base areas of the Vietnamese war of resistance expanded and connected with the great People's Republic of China and all fraternal countries, reaching the banks of the Elbe River. The situation became increasingly favorable for the cause of liberation of the Vietnamese people. Under the conditions at that time, the Vietnam Workers' Party was founded, inheriting the cause and glorious tradition of the Indochinese Communist Party, and openly came forward to lead, in order to "vigorously promote the war of resistance to achieve victory and strive to build a Vietnam that is independent, unified, democratic, and prosperous."
    In the past five years, the struggle of the Party and the Vietnamese nation has become increasingly arduous and fierce, but at the same time, it has created major changes of historical significance.
    U.S. imperialism and the French colonialists, together, attempted to prolong and expand the Indochina War as much as possible. Under the leadership of the Party, the Vietnamese people resolutely carried out a war of resistance, resisting American interventionists and French colonialists. We recognized that the task of the Vietnamese revolution was to resist imperialists on the Southeast Asian front, thereby jointly defending world and Asian peace. In turn, our struggle relied on an infinitely broad and consolidated camp. The Vietnamese war of resistance successively defeated various aggressive plans of the U.S. and France. Particularly historically significant was the victory at Dien Bien Phu, and the subsequent restoration of peace in Indochina shortly thereafter.
    Following this victory, the Vietnamese people's struggle shifted from armed struggle to political struggle on the basis of the Geneva Accords, in order to consolidate peace, achieve unification, and complete national independence and democracy.
    While defining the task of opposing imperialist aggression, the Party also defined the policy of correctly resolving the land issue for peasants. After the August Revolution, the Party advocated a 25% rent reduction, implemented interest reduction, and confiscated the land of French colonialists and Vietnamese traitors to distribute to peasants. In 1951, the Party began to mobilize the masses to thoroughly implement the rent reduction policy and initially overthrow the evil landlords. In 1953, the land reform movement began to enter the period of overthrowing the entire landlord class and realizing "land to the tiller." Currently, the land reform movement is being fully carried out in the northern plains and midland areas and will be completed in 1956. At the same time, we are embarking on the implementation of the 1956 national plan in order to complete the two-year plan for economic recovery and cultural development.
    The Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the Indochinese Communist Party in the past, and now under the Vietnam Workers' Party, have already traveled an important path on the road of revolution.
    More than half of Vietnam's territory has been completely liberated and is building a people's democratic system, gradually moving towards socialism. U.S. imperialism and Ngo Dinh Diem are trying their best to turn South Vietnam into another country completely subordinate to the United States under Ngo Dinh Diem's dictatorial rule, but the patriotic movement in the South continues to develop.
    The Vietnam Workers' Party has achieved such brilliant results because it accepted the valuable experience of the world's working class very early on, and armed itself with the most advanced science of mankind, the theory of Marxism-Leninism.
    The Vietnam Workers' Party strives to study Marxism-Leninism and apply it to the specific environment of Vietnam, defining the correct direction in order to lead the Vietnamese revolution, "complete national liberation, develop people's democracy, and advance towards socialism."
    In the long, arduous, and complex struggle to realize this political line, the Party pays attention to constantly cultivating various factors for the victory of the Vietnamese revolution. These factors of victory are mainly: a new type of political party, a national united front, a revolutionary army, a people's regime, and international solidarity.
    Among these five factors, the new type of political party is the most important and has decisive significance. "The Vietnam Workers' Party is the party of the Vietnamese working class and working people, that is, the party of the workers, peasants, and laborers who are the most resolute, the most courageous, and wholeheartedly serve the motherland and the people."
    The Party has an outstanding leader, who is also the most beloved leader of the entire nation, Comrade Ho Chi Minh.
    The Vietnam Workers' Party has achieved internal unity and has a correct political line to lead the revolution. The Party constantly establishes and consolidates its close ties with the masses. Therefore, the Party has become the party of the masses.
    The Party correctly recognizes that the dual tasks of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism in the Vietnamese national democratic revolution must be realized simultaneously and cannot be separated from each other. Therefore, the Party put forward appropriate policies for resolving the peasant land problem based on the development of the revolution. Through this, the Party gathered the broad masses of peasants, who are the main force of the Vietnamese national democratic revolution, and consolidated the worker-peasant alliance and the Party's leading position in the national united front.
    However, due to the colonial and semi-feudal social environment, and also because it has not truly deeply understood Marxism-Leninism, the Party also has some shortcomings. The thinking of cadres and party members has not completely eliminated the influence of imperialism and feudalism. In 1949-1950, the Party's development was not cautious enough, resulting in complex party member composition. Some opportunists, traitors, powerful landlords, or members of reactionary parties sneaked into the Party, using some of the Party's local organizations to resist the Party's policies. Politically, the Party did not promptly discover this internal impurity and the phenomenon of widespread right-leaning thought within the Party, and for a period of time, it did not pay enough attention to leading the implementation of land policies, so the Party's policies were biased or sabotaged in implementation. From 1952 to now, these shortcomings are being overcome. A party rectification study from top to bottom has brought the following victories: resolving the non-proletarian thinking among cadres, raising proletarian thinking, distinguishing between enemies, ourselves, and friends, and establishing a good atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism within the Party.
    In terms of the Party's organization, rectification is continuing in conjunction with land reform. Those landlord elements and other members of the exploiting classes, those servants of imperialism, have been purged from the Party. At the same time, the Party has absorbed tens of thousands of excellent poor peasants and farm laborers, so that the Party's foundation in the countryside has been strongly consolidated after the land reform. In the process of mobilizing the masses to carry out rent reduction and land reform, mass work was also rectified, making the Party's leading position more consolidated and the Party's influence among the masses more expanded and deepened.
    The Party constantly pays attention to the work of the national united front. The Party constantly formulates correct tactics based on the situation of each period, in order to unite the broad masses to struggle for the realization of various revolutionary tasks.
    The Viet Minh Front united the people of all strata against fascism, enabling the victory of the August Revolution. The Lien Viet Front united the people of all strata against American interventionists, French colonialists, and their lackeys, Vietnamese traitors, enabling the victory of the war of resistance. The Vietnam Fatherland Front is widely gathering national and democratic forces to oppose U.S. imperialism, oppose Ngo Dinh Diem, and strive to consolidate peace and achieve the unification of the motherland on the basis of independence and democracy. The program of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, announced in September 1955, has won widespread approval and support at home and abroad. This program has a great role in the current political struggle.
    The Party is able to concentrate the flames of revolutionary struggle on the main enemy according to the situation of each period, guiding the national struggle to move forward. But the Party also constantly and correctly adhered to the principle that the national united front must always be built on the foundation of the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class.
    Because it has a correct united front policy and constantly struggles to realize this policy, the Party is able to constantly consolidate its leading position and gain the trust and love of the people of all strata.
    The Vietnam People's Army, established in the Viet Bac War Zone in 1944, was the main tool of the August Uprising in 1945. When the French colonialists returned to carry out aggression, the Party advocated that it must lead the people in a long-term war of resistance. The Party attached great importance to the work of building the Vietnam People's Army and military leadership.
    In the process of revolutionary struggle, the Vietnam People's Army grew up, from nothing to something, from few to many, from weak to strong. The actual situation of the Vietnamese war of resistance proves that the military science of Marxism-Leninism is very good. The Vietnamese nation was ruled by imperialism and feudalism for a long time. When we rose up to resist the modern troops of imperialism, we did not yet have a regular army. But the Vietnamese people have ardent patriotism and an indomitable fighting will. Relying on this political advantage, the Party built and developed various armed and semi-armed forces, launched guerrilla warfare in various regions, and took the countryside as its base. The Vietnam People's Army, mostly composed of workers and peasants, has gradually grown up in this process of construction and combat, constantly holding high the banner of certain victory in every battle.
    After the restoration of peace, the Vietnam People's Army correctly implemented the provisions of the Geneva Accords regarding ceasefire, concentration, and transfer, and all other provisions, and well received all the newly liberated areas in the North. Currently, the Vietnam People's Army is the backbone force for defending the motherland and the backbone force for the political struggle of the entire people.
    The Vietnamese People's Democratic regime began to be built in the various liberated areas in the form of various people's revolutionary committees. After the victory of the August Revolution, the system of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, whose essence is the people's democratic dictatorship, was established throughout the country. In early January 1946, the Vietnamese people elected the first National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, followed by the election of people's committees at all levels.
    In the war of resistance, the Vietnamese People's Democratic regime has shown its role and prestige, has powerfully promoted the war of resistance, and has been loved and trusted by the entire people. This is because the Vietnamese People's Democratic regime has the national united front as its strong backing and has obtained the correct leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party.
    The Vietnamese People's Democratic regime constantly attaches importance to cultivating the strength of the people and the strength of the war of resistance, in order to guarantee supplies to the front and partially improve the people's lives. Therefore, although Vietnam's economic foundation is backward and the Vietnamese people are poor, it has been guaranteed to maintain and develop the war of resistance until victory.
    Currently, in the North, the people's democratic regime is being consolidated. Rural areas everywhere are rising up to overthrow the thousand-year feudal rule and gradually embark on the road of collective production starting from the form of mutual aid groups. Private industrial and commercial enterprises are being adjusted to serve the national economy. The state-owned economic component is developing. Workers, peasants, intellectuals, and people from all walks of life in industry and commerce are enthusiastically contributing their respective strengths to economic recovery and cultural development. In particular, workers and peasant brothers and sisters, in the campaign to increase production and practice thrift, have shown their infinite potential for labor and creation. The people's democratic regime is being built very beautifully in the North. This is a source of hope and a great inspiration to our compatriots in the South in the struggle to consolidate peace and achieve the unification of the motherland.
    The Vietnamese revolution has a domestic foundation of unity led by the Vietnam Workers' Party. The Vietnamese revolution also relies on the international solidarity between fraternal Parties and fraternal countries headed by the Soviet Union and China. Every victory of the Soviet Union, China, other fraternal countries, every victory of the French people under the leadership of the French Communist Party, every victory of the national liberation movement in colonial and semi-colonial countries, and every victory of the world peace and democracy movement are linked to the development of the Vietnamese revolution.
    The great victory of the Soviet army in defeating fascism played a decisive role in the victory of the August Revolution. The victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War played a huge role in the victory of the Vietnamese War of Resistance.
    On January 18, 1950, China, the Soviet Union, and other fraternal People's Democratic countries successively recognized the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and established diplomatic relations with our country. This event marked an important step forward in the international solidarity between the Vietnamese people and the people of all fraternal countries, and at the same time raised Vietnam's international status. After the restoration of peace in Indochina, especially in 1955, this international solidarity took another step forward. The delegation of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, headed by President Ho Chi Minh, visited the Soviet Union, China, and the Mongolian People's Republic, strengthening the friendly relations between Vietnam and the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries. This event has played a great role in the political struggle of the Vietnamese people. Fraternal countries have also given us huge assistance in economic and cultural aspects, helping us to quickly heal the wounds of war, restore and develop the economy, and gradually improve the people's material and cultural standards.
    Forever consolidated international solidarity is clearly one of the factors of the Vietnamese revolution. This international solidarity is a new type of international relationship, built on the foundation of solid proletarian internationalism, and is completely consistent with genuine patriotism. This international solidarity has a completely new content. The most obvious is the generous and selfless assistance that the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries have given us. Standing in Vietnam's position, we use the spirit of self-reliance to accept this valuable assistance, using it as valuable capital for striving to rebuild the country. This eloquently illustrates that the international solidarity between Vietnam and fraternal countries is completely different from the relationship of subordination and enslavement between Ngo Dinh Diem and U.S. imperialism.
    The above are the major lessons the Party has learned and some of the Party's important tasks, and are the major achievements the Party has made in the cause of applying Marxism-Leninism to the environment of the Vietnamese revolution. Experience makes us recognize: "All the Party's successes and failures, the Party's development and consolidation or regression and stagnation, are closely related to the correctness or incorrectness of the Party's political line and organizational line, and with the correctness or incorrectness of the viewpoints and solutions to issues such as building the Party, building the united front, armed struggle and building the army, establishing and consolidating the people's democratic regime, realizing and strengthening international solidarity."
    Our current political task is to struggle for building a peaceful, unified, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam, and to consolidate peace and achieve unification on the basis of independence and democracy. This line has been clearly written in the program of the Vietnam Fatherland Front and has been adopted by the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This line is fully in line with the spirit of the Geneva Accords, which are based on the wishes of all the Vietnamese people and conform to the expectations of peace-loving people all over the world.
    However, Ngo Dinh Diem, succumbing to the orders of U.S. imperialism, is still trying his best to sabotage the implementation of the Geneva Accords, intensify the conspiracy to split Vietnam, attempting to turn the South into another country completely subordinate to the United States under Ngo Dinh Diem's dictatorial rule, preparing to participate in the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc and preparing to re-launch the war. These actions of U.S. imperialism and Ngo Dinh Diem have aroused the infinite indignation of all the Vietnamese people from North to South and overseas compatriots.
    The current attitude of the government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is: to request that the countries concerned reconvene the Geneva Conference held in 1954, with the participation of the three countries in the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Vietnam, in order to find a solution to the political problems of Vietnam and continue to implement the Geneva Accords. The Vietnamese people believe that our political struggle, although long-term and arduous, will surely be victorious.

    纪念越南劳动党成立五周年
    越南劳动党中央执行委员会委员　阮维桢
    3月3日是越南劳动党成立五周年纪念日，同时也是印度支那共产党斗争26周年的纪念日。
    这一天是我们全党的大喜的日子，同时也是越南全体人民的大喜的
  日子。
    越南工人阶级和它的先锋队，从1930年到今天，一直领导着越南人民，坚决为民族独立、民主、自由和幸福而斗争。
    在以胡志明同志为首的党中央执行委员会的正确领导下，党始终是越南革命前进的引路灯。
    当1945年越南人民刚刚取得胜利后不久，法国殖民者在其他帝国主义的支持下回过头来侵略越南。党相信人民有无穷的战斗力，坚决领导人民进行持久的全面抗战，借以保卫和发展八月革命的胜利。在遭受帝国主义者四面包围的情况下，要抵抗一支专业的殖民侵略军队，党和全民族接受了一场空前严重的考验。在开头几年中，我们曾多次击败了敌人的进攻，保持和巩固了抗战根据地。1950年，中国大陆全部解放，越南边界战役获得胜利，越南抗战根据地扩大，和伟大的中华人民共和国以及所有各兄弟国家连接起来，直到易比河的岸边。形势对于越南人民的解放事业越来越有利了。在当时的条件下，越南劳动党成立，继承印度支那共产党的事业和光荣传统，公开出面领导，借以“大力推动抗战达到胜利，为建设一个独立、统一、民主和富强的越南而奋斗。”
    在过去的五年中，党和越南民族的斗争事业日益艰苦激烈，但同时也造成了具有历史意义的重大变化。
    美帝国主义和法国殖民者一起，企图竭力延长和扩大印度支那战争。越南人民在党的领导下，坚决进行抗战，抵抗美国干涉者和法国殖民者。我们认识到越南革命的任务是在东南亚前哨反抗帝国主义者，借以合力保卫世界和亚洲的和平。反过来，我们的斗争又倚靠着一个无限广阔而巩固的阵营。越南的抗战接连地击败了美、法的各种侵略计划。特别具有历史意义的，是奠边府的胜利，以及随后不久的印度支那和平的恢复。
    随着这一胜利之后，越南人民的斗争从武装斗争转到在日内瓦协定的基础上为巩固和平、实现统一、完成全国的独立和民主的政治斗争。
    党在规定了反对帝国主义侵略的任务的同时，又规定了正确解决农民土地问题的政策。在八月革命之后，党主张减租25％，实行减息并没收法国殖民者和越奸的土地分给农民。1951年，党开始发动群众，彻底实现减租政策并初步打倒恶霸地主。1953年，土地改革运动开始进到打倒整个地主阶级，实现“耕者有其田”的时期。现在，土地改革运动正在北方平原地区和中游地区全面开展，并将于1956年完成。同时，我们正在着手执行1956年国家计划，以便完成恢复经济和发展文化的两年计划。
    越南人民过去在印度支那共产党、现在在越南劳动党的领导下，已经在革命的道路上走过了重要的路程。
    一半以上的越南国土已经完全解放，正在建设人民民主制度，逐步走向社会主义。美帝国主义和吴庭艳正在竭力企图把越南南方变成另一个在吴庭艳的独裁统治下完全附属于美国的国家，但是南方的爱国运动仍然不停地发展着。
    越南劳动党有这样一些光辉的成绩是因为它很早就接受了世界工人阶级的宝贵经验，用人类最先进的科学的马克思列宁主义理论武装起来。
    越南劳动党努力学习马克思列宁主义，并把它们运用于越南的具体环境，规定了正确的方向，以便领导越南革命，“完成民族解放，发展人民民主，向社会主义前进。”
    在为实现这一政治路线而进行的长期、艰苦和复杂的斗争中，党注意经常培养越南革命胜利的各种因素。这些胜利的因素主要是：新型政党，民族统一战线，革命军队，人民政权和国际团结。
    在这五个因素中，新型政党是最重要的因素并且具有决定性的意义，“越南劳动党是越南工人阶级和劳动人民的政党，即是那些最坚决、最勇敢、全心全力为祖国服务和为人民服务的工人、农民和劳动者的政党。”
    党有了一位出色的领袖，同时也是全民族最亲爱的领袖胡志明同志。
    越南劳动党实现了内部的团结统一，并且有正确的政治路线以便领导革命。党不断地建立和巩固自己和群众的密切联系。因此，党成为群众的党。
    党正确认识到：越南的民族民主革命的反帝国主义和反封建的两重任务必须同时实现，不能互相分离。因此党根据革命的发展提出了解决农民土地问题的适当的政策。借此，党集合了作为越南民族民主革命主力的广大农民群众，巩固了工农联盟和党在民族统一战线中的领导地位。
    但是，由于殖民地和半封建的社会环境，也由于还没有真正深刻领会马克思列宁主义，党也有一些缺点。干部和党员的思想还没有彻底清除帝国主义和封建主义的影响。在1949年—1950年党发展得不够慎重，以致党员成分复杂。一些机会主义分子、叛徒、强豪或反动党派分子钻进党内，利用党的一部分地方组织，反抗党的政策。在政治方面，党没有及时发现这种内部不纯的情况和党内普遍存在着右倾思想的现象，并且在一个时期内曾在某种程度上不重视领导执行土地政策，因此，党的政策在执行中发生偏向或被破坏。从1952年到现在，这些缺点正得到克服。一次从上至下的整党学习已经带来了如下的胜利：解决了干部中的非无产阶级思想，提高了无产阶级思想，分清了敌、我、友，并且建立了党内批评和自我批评的良好风气。
    在党的组织方面，正结合土地改革继续进行整顿。那些地主分子和其他剥削阶级分子，那些帝国主义的仆从分子，都被清除出党，同时，党吸收了成万优秀的贫农和雇农，使党在农村中的基础在土地改革之后获得坚强巩固。在发动群众进行减租和土地改革的过程中也整顿了群众工作，使党的领导地位更巩固，党在群众中的影响更扩大和深入。
    党经常注意民族统一战线工作，党根据每一个时期的情况经常规定正确的策略，借以团结广大的群众为实现各种革命任务而斗争。
    越盟战线团结了各阶层人民反对法西斯，使八月革命获得胜利。越联战线团结了各阶层人民反对美国干涉者、法国殖民者和他们的走狗越奸，使抗战获得胜利。越南祖国战线正在广泛集合民族和民主力量，反对美帝国主义，反对吴庭艳，为巩固和平并在独立和民主的基础上实现祖国统一而斗争。1955年9月间公布的越南祖国战线纲领获得国内国外广泛的赞成和拥护，这个纲领对于目前的政治斗争有很大的作用。
    党能够根据每一个时期的情况，把革命斗争的火焰集中指向主要的敌人，引导民族斗争向前发展。但党也不断正确的坚持了民族统一战线无论何时都必须建立在由工人阶级领导的工农联盟的基础上的原则。
    由于有正确的统一战线政策并且不断地为实现这一政策而进行斗争，党能够经常巩固自己的领导地位并且获得各阶层人民的信赖和热爱。
    1944年在越北战区成立的越南人民军队是1945年八月起义的主要工具。当法国殖民者重新回来进行侵略的时候，党主张必须领导人民进行长期抗战，党非常重视建设越南人民军队的工作和军事领导工作。
    在革命斗争的过程中，越南人民军队成长起来了，从无到有，从少到多，从弱到强。越南抗战的实际情况证明了马克思列宁主义的军事科学非常好。越南民族被帝国主义和封建主义长期统治，当我们奋起抵抗帝国主义的现代化部队的时候，我们还没有正规军。但是越南人民有热烈的爱国心和不屈的斗争意志，党依靠了这种政治优势，建设并发展各种武装和半武装力量，在各个地区发动游击战争，以农村为依据。大部分由工农群众组成的越南人民军队已经在这一建设和战斗的过程中逐渐成长起来了，不断高举着百战百胜的旗帜。
    和平恢复后，越南人民军正确执行了日内瓦协定关于停火、集中、转移的条款和一切其他条款，并且很好地接收了北方的各处新解放区。目前，越南人民军队是保卫祖国的中坚力量，是全民政治斗争的中坚力量。
    越南人民民主政权开始在各个解放区以各种人民革命委员会的形式建设起来。八月革命胜利后，在全国范围内建立了越南民主共和制度，它的实质是人民民主专政制度。1946年1月初，越南人民选出了越南民主共和国的第一个国民大会，接着选出了各级人民委员会。
    在抗战中，越南人民民主政权已经显示出自己的作用和威信，已经有力地推动了抗战并且为全体人民所热爱和信赖。这是由于越南人民民主政权有民族统一战线作为它的强有力的后盾，并且获得越南劳动党的正确领导。
    越南人民民主政权经常重视培养人民的力量和抗战力量，借以保证对前线的供应并且部分改善人民的生活。因此，越南的经济基础虽然落后，越南人民虽然贫困，但已经保证维持并发展抗战直至胜利。
    目前，在北方，人民民主政权正在巩固，各地农村正在起来打倒千年的封建统治，逐步走上从互助组的形式开始的集体生产的道路。私营工商业正在进行调整，以便为国民经济服务。国营经济成分正在发展，工农群众、脑力劳动者和工商界各阶层人民，都热烈奋发，为恢复经济、发展文化贡献各自的力量。特别是工人和农民兄弟姐妹们，在增产节约竞赛运动中，他们已经显示出自己的劳动和创造的无穷潜力。人民民主政权正在北方建设得非常美好，这对于在为巩固和平、实现祖国统一的斗争中的南方同胞是希望的泉源，是伟大的鼓舞力量。
    越南革命有由越南劳动党领导的国内团结基础，越南革命还依靠着以苏联和中国为首的各兄弟党和兄弟国家之间的国际团结。苏联、中国和其他各兄弟国家的每一胜利，法国人民在法国共产党领导下的每一胜利，各殖民地和半殖民地国家的民族解放运动以及世界和平民主运动的每一胜利，都和越南革命的发展连结在一起。
    苏联军队击败法西斯的伟大胜利对八月革命的胜利起了决定性的作用。中国人民解放战争的胜利对越南抗战的胜利起了巨大的作用。
    1950年1月18日，中国、苏联和各兄弟人民民主国家已经先后承认越南民主共和国政府并且和我国建立了外交关系。这件事标志着越南人民同各兄弟国家人民之间的国际团结前进了重要的一步，同时已提高了越南的国际地位。印度支那和平恢复以后，尤其是在1955年中，这种国际团结又前进了一步。以胡志明主席为首的越南民主共和国政府代表团访问了苏联、中国和蒙古人民共和国，加强了越南同苏联、中国和其他各兄弟国家之间的友谊关系。这件事对于越南人民的政治斗争已经起了伟大的作用。各兄弟国家还在经济和文化方面给我国巨大的援助，帮助我们迅速医治战争的创伤，恢复和发展经济，逐步提高人民的物质和文化水平。
    永远巩固的国际团结明显地是越南革命的因素之一。这种国际团结是一种新型的国际关系，建立在巩固的无产阶级国际主义的基础上，和真正的爱国主义完全一致。这种国际团结有一个完全新的内容。最明显的是苏联、中国和各兄弟国家已经给予我们的慷慨无私的援助。站在越南的立场，我们以自力更生的精神来接受这种宝贵的援助，以它作为努力重建国家的宝贵的资金。这一点雄辩地说明了越南和各兄弟国家之间的国际团结关系同吴庭艳和美帝国主义之间的附属和奴役关系完全不同。
    上述种种，是党所获得的重大教训和党的一些重要任务，是党在运用马克思列宁主义于越南革命环境的事业中所获得的重大成果。经验使我们认识：“党的一切成功和失败，党获得发展和巩固或者是退后和停滞，都同党的政治路线、组织路线的正确或错误有密切联系，同对建设党、建设统一战线、武装斗争和建设军队、建立和巩固人民民主政权、实现和增强国际团结等问题的观点和解决得正确或错误有密切联系。”
    目前我们的政治任务是为建设一个和平、统一、民主和富强的越南，为巩固和平、在独立和民主的基础上实现统一而斗争。这一路线已经明确地写在越南祖国战线的纲领中，并且已经获得越南民主共和国国民大会通过。这一路线和日内瓦协定的精神完全一致，——这个协定以越南全体人民的愿望为根据，并符合于全世界爱好和平人民的期望。
    但是，吴庭艳屈从美帝国主义的命令，仍在竭力破坏日内瓦协定的执行，加紧实行分裂越南的阴谋，企图把南方变成在吴庭艳的独裁统治下完全附属美国的另一个国家，准备参加东南亚侵略集团并且准备重新发动战争。美帝国主义和吴庭艳的这些行动，已经激起从北至南的全体越南人民和国外侨胞的无限公愤。
    越南民主共和国政府和人民目前的态度是：要求有关各国重新召开1954年举行的日内瓦会议，并有越南停战的国际监督和监察委员会中的三国参加会议，以便找寻解决越南政治问题的办法，并继续执行日内瓦协定。越南人民相信，我们的政治斗争虽然是长期的，艰苦的，但一定能获得胜利。
