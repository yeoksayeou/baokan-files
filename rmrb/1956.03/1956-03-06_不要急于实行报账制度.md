    Don't Rush to Implement the Reimbursement System
    In Xi'an, some state-owned commercial departments are too eager to require joint state-private retail stores to implement a system of issuing invoices and various reimbursements. This has caused many small retail stores to either raise the minimum purchase amount or stop retail sales and switch to small wholesale business because they are afraid that issuing invoices and reimbursements is too troublesome. A joint state-private grocery store on Beida Street used to sell many items individually, but now if you go to buy pickles or chili peppers, you have to buy at least four ounces; if you buy seasonings, you have to buy at least two ounces, and salt has to be bought in at least half a catty. Some stores no longer sell small commodities such as buttons and sewing needles individually; some stores even issue an invoice for selling a single fried dough stick, and customers have to buy meal tickets before eating.
    This will not only affect the enthusiasm of small stores due to overly complicated procedures and systems, but also bring inconvenience to consumers. This kind of practice, which does not proceed from the interests of the masses, cannot be tolerated.

    不要急于实行报账制度
    西安市有些国营商业部门，过急地要求公私合营零售商店实行开发票和各种报账制度，使得许多小零售商店因为怕开发票和报账太麻烦，提高了零售起点或者停止零售业务改做小批发业务。北大街有一家公私合营杂货店，过去有很多商品可以零卖，现在去买酱菜、辣子，最少得买四两；买调料最少要买二两，食盐最少要买半斤。有的商店连扣子、缝衣针等小商品也不零卖了；有的铺子卖一条油条也要开一张发票，吃饭要顾客先买饭票。
    这样不但会因为手续制度太麻烦而影响小商店经营的积极性，而且会给消费者带来了不便。这种不从群众利益出发的做法，是不能容许的。
