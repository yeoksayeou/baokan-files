The Construction of the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries

    Achievements of Soviet Prospecting Work

    Soviet Minister of Geology and Mineral Resource Protection, Antropov, told TASS reporters that not long ago, Soviet geologists discovered rich alluvial diamond deposits and the largest producing area in the so-called Siberian Platform within the Yakut Autonomous Republic. Based on all materials, this newly discovered mining area can be compared with the famous African mining areas. The discovery of this diamond producing area is of great significance in the Soviet Union.

    Currently, the proven reserves of iron, manganese, coal, copper, lead, chromite, potash, and other minerals in the Soviet Union rank first in the world.

    In 1954, Soviet geologists discovered a huge body of first-class iron ore, reaching a depth of 500 meters, within the Belgorod Oblast. According to its composition and properties, this ore body is very similar to the ore of Krivoy Rog, with an iron content exceeding 60%. Considering that the discovered iron ore is located close to industrial centers, the significance of this discovery for our national economy is difficult to estimate.

    Between 1954 and 1955, huge deposits of titanium and zirconium were discovered in Ukraine. As everyone knows, titanium is considered a very promising metal in the future due to its high heat resistance.

    Huge oil producing areas have been discovered in the region between the Volga River and the Urals. Currently, the proven oil reserves in these places are much larger than the oil reserves in the entire Caucasus region.

    In addition, Soviet geologists have discovered and explored natural gas in the North Caucasus, the Volga River Basin, and Siberia; potash in Belarus; copper in Kazakhstan and the Urals; aluminum in the Urals, Kazakhstan, and Siberia; molybdenum in Kazakhstan and Eastern Siberia; and tin in the Far East.

    Antropov finally pointed out that it is necessary to carry out planned geological research work in all territories of our motherland in order to ascertain various underground mineral resources to guarantee the development of the national economy and to establish mineral raw material reserves for our industry exceeding its needs for 40 to 50 years.

    Korean People Actively Plant Trees and Make Forests

    Preparations for planting trees and making forests are being actively carried out on the hills and fields of North Korea, in order to complete the spring planting work before the Forest Protection Period from April 1st to 15th. Tree planting work has already begun in the western coastal area of Hwanghae-namdo.

    This spring, approximately 140 million saplings of various kinds will be planted, and approximately 80 million seeds of several kinds of trees will be directly sown in various regions.

    This year, the afforestation area for protecting cultivated land will be approximately 1.5 times larger than last year, and the area for planting Arabian rubber trees, poplars, and other fast-growing trees will be expanded by several thousand cho.

    Vietnam's Mutual Aid Work Exchange Movement

    The mutual aid work exchange movement has greatly developed in the vast countryside of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. According to incomplete statistics, in the 20 provinces, Hong Gai, and Quang Yen regions of northern Vietnam, as well as the Thai-Meo Autonomous Region, more than half of the local farmers have already participated in mutual aid teams. In some provinces, permanent mutual aid teams account for 10% to 18%.

    Bulgaria's Agricultural Cooperativization Movement

    In Bulgaria, where over 61% of the country's land has already been cooperativized, the cooperativization movement is developing even faster this year than last year.

    In the past year, a total of 27,000 individual farmers across the country joined agricultural production cooperatives, while in the first two months of this year alone, 75,000 individual farmers nationwide applied to join agricultural production cooperatives. A surge of individual farmers requesting to join existing cooperatives is emerging in many rural areas. For example, after Trastenik Village in Pleven Province approved the joining of 447 individual farmers into the cooperative in early March, the entire village has been fully cooperativized.

    Albania's Rural Cooperativization Upsurge

    Albania's rural cooperativization movement has entered a new upsurge. In the first two months of this year, more than 100 newly established agricultural production cooperatives were established, almost equivalent to five times the number of cooperatives established throughout 1954. Albania now has 420 agricultural production cooperatives. According to the decision of the Central Committee of the Labor Party's plenary session last December, the number of cooperatives will be doubled by the end of this year compared to last year.

    苏联和人民民主国家的建设
    苏联探矿工作的成就
    苏联地质和矿藏保护部部长安特罗波夫向塔斯社记者说，不久以前，苏联的地质学家在雅库特自治共和国境内的所谓西伯利亚台地，发现了金刚石丰富的冲积矿床和最大的产地。根据全部材料来看，这个新发现的矿区能够同著名的非洲矿区比美。这个金刚石产地的发现在苏联是一件具有重大意义的事。
    目前，苏联的铁、锰、煤、铜、铅、铬铁、钾盐等矿产的探得储量占世界第一位。
    1954年，苏联地质学家在别尔哥罗德州境内发现了深达500公尺的一级铁矿的巨大矿体，这个矿体按它的成分和性质来说同克里沃罗格的矿石很相似，含铁量超过60％。如果考虑到已经发现的铁矿的位置靠近工业中心，那么这个发现对于我们国民经济的意义就很难估价了。
    在1954—1955年间，在乌克兰发现了巨大的钛矿和锆矿的巨大矿床。大家知道，就高度的耐热性这一点来说，钛被认为是将来用处很广的金属。
    在伏尔加河和乌拉尔之间地区发现了巨大的石油产地。目前这些地方的石油探得储量比整个高加索产地的石油储量要多得多。
    此外，苏联地质学家还在北高加索、伏尔加河流域、西伯利亚发现和勘探出天然煤气；在白俄罗斯发现和勘探出钾盐；在哈萨克、乌拉尔发现和勘探出铜；在乌拉尔、哈萨克、西伯利亚发现了铝；在哈萨克和东西伯利亚发现了钼；在远东发现了锡。
    安特罗波夫最后指出，必须在我们祖国的全部领土上进行有计划的地质研究工作，以便查明各种地下矿藏来保证国民经济的发展，并且为我国工业建立超过它40年到50年需要量的矿物原料储备。
    朝鲜人民积极植树造林
    朝鲜的山岗和田野上，正在积极进行植树造林的准备工作，以便在从4月1日到15日的护林期以前完成春季的植树工作。在黄海南道西海岸一带地区已经开始了植树工作。
    今春将栽植各种树苗大约14，000万株，各地区还将直接播种几种树的种子约8，000万粒。
    今年保护耕地的造林地区将比去年扩大约一点五倍，栽植阿拉伯橡胶树、白杨和其他成长快的树木的地区将扩大数千町步。
    越南的变工互助运动
    越南民主共和国广大农村中的变工互助运动已经有很大发展。据不完全的统计，在越南北方20个省和鸿基、广安地区以及泰族—苗族自治区中，当地一半以上的农户已经参加了互助组。在一些省的互助组中，常年互助组占了10％到18％。保加利亚的农业合作化运动
    在全国61％以上的土地已经合作化了的保加利亚，今年合作化运动又以比去年快得多的速度向前发展。
    在去年一年中，全国共有27，000个个体农民参加了农业生产合作社，而在今年的头两个多月的时间里，全国就有75，000个个体农民申请加入农业生产合作社。许多农村正在出现个体农民要求加入现有的合作社的热潮。例如，普列文州特拉斯特尼克村在3月初批准447个个体农民加入合作社以后，全村已经全部合作化了。
    阿尔巴尼亚农村合作化高潮
    阿尔巴尼亚农村合作化运动进入了新的高潮。在今年头两个月中，新成立的农业生产合作社有100多个，差不多相当于1954年全年成立的合作社的五倍。阿尔巴尼亚现在有农业生产合作社420个，根据劳动党中央去年12月全体会议的规定，到今年年底，合作社数目将增加到去年的两倍。
