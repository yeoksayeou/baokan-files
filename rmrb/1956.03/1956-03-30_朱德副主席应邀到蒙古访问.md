Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, 29th:  At the invitation of the Mongolian People's Republic, the Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China, Marshal Zhu De, accompanied by the Vice Chairman of the Presidium of the Great People's Hural of the Mongolian People's Republic, Zedib, who went to the Mongolian-Soviet border to welcome him, and the Chinese Ambassador to Mongolia, He Ying, arrived in Ulan Bator at 1:00 PM on March 28th by special train.

A grand welcoming ceremony was held at the Ulan Bator railway station upon Vice Chairman Zhu De's arrival.  After disembarking, Vice Chairman Zhu De warmly shook hands with the Chairman of the Presidium of the Great People's Hural of the Mongolian People's Republic, Sambu, and Prime Minister Tsedenbal, who came to welcome him.  Accompanied by them, he inspected the guard of honor and accepted flowers presented by children from Ulan Bator.

Also present at the station to welcome him were: First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, Damba; First Deputy Prime Minister of the Mongolian People's Republic, Shirindib; Deputy Prime Ministers Luvsan, Maidar, and Tsend; Mayor of Ulan Bator, Bag; as well as leading Party and government officials from various Mongolian departments, senior generals of the People's Army, and heads of various people's organizations.

Also at the station to welcome him were Soviet Ambassador to Mongolia, Pisarev; Korean Ambassador to Mongolia, Hong Dong-cheol; and diplomatic officials from various embassies.  Staff members of the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia, members of the Chinese economic delegation currently in Mongolia, representatives of overseas Chinese, and Chinese students also went to the station to welcome him.

Chairman Sambu delivered a welcoming speech at the station.  He said: The great victory achieved by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party against the united reactionary forces of domestic and international enemies has opened a new era for the development and strengthening of the fraternal friendly cooperation between the Mongolian and Chinese peoples.  Under the leadership of its glorious Communist Party and People's Government, the great Chinese people, in a short historical period, have not only restored the national economy destroyed by prolonged war, but are also successfully implementing the first Five-Year Plan for socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture. The Mongolian people are infinitely pleased by this.

In his welcoming speech, Sambu pointed out: The great world power, the People's Republic of China, is a powerful factor in maintaining peace in Asia and the world.  However, the aggressive forces headed by the United States are obstructing the People's Republic of China from obtaining its legitimate seat in the United Nations, and the United States continues to occupy China's territory of Taiwan, hindering the Chinese government and people from exercising their sovereignty over this territory.  This situation is completely intolerable.  China's firm position on this issue is strongly supported by all progressive forces around the world, as well as by the people of the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and the people's democratic countries.

In his reply, Vice Chairman Zhu De conveyed the most sincere respect and warmest greetings from the Chinese people to the Mongolian people.  Vice Chairman Zhu De said:  In the nearly thirty-five years, under the leadership of the long-tested and tempered Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, the Mongolian people have traversed a great and glorious path.  Guided by the truth of Marxism-Leninism, this path has enabled the Mongolian people to leap over the stage of capitalist development from feudal society and embark on the road of prosperous and strong socialist construction.  Currently, the Mongolian people are working hard to complete the Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy and culture, and are constantly achieving new and significant successes.  The Chinese people are greatly encouraged by these brilliant achievements of the Mongolian people.

Vice Chairman Zhu De continued:  The people of China and Mongolia have a long tradition of friendship, which has been further developed in the years of our two peoples' revolutionary struggles.  Now, the increasingly consolidated and developing fraternal friendship, unity, mutual assistance, and cooperation between the Chinese and Mongolian peoples, built on the foundation of Marxism-Leninism, will not only benefit the socialist construction of our two countries, but will also make beneficial contributions to strengthening the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism, and to defending peace in Asia and the world.

Subsequently, accompanied by Chairman Sambu and Prime Minister Tsedenbal, Vice Chairman Zhu De rode in a car to the Mongolian State Villa amidst the cheers of the welcoming crowds.  Along the way, he was welcomed by crowds of about 20,000 people lining the streets, and Vice Chairman Zhu De frequently waved to the welcoming crowds in greeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, 29th: Accompanied by the Chinese Ambassador to Mongolia, He Ying, Vice Chairman Zhu De and his entourage paid respects at the mausoleum of the Mongolian people's revolutionary leaders, Sukhe-Bator and Marshal Choibalsan, at 9:00 PM on March 28th, and laid wreaths. Accompanying them from the Mongolian People's Republic were Vice Chairman of the Presidium of the Great People's Hural of Mongolia, Zedib; Secretary-General Sharav; Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ravdan; Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Luvsanshultem; and the Mongolian Ambassador to China, Ochirbat.
