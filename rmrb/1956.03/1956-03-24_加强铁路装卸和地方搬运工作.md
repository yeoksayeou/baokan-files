Strengthen Railway Loading/Unloading and Local搬运 Work
    Wang Guilin
    With the arrival of the upsurge of socialist construction, the volume of goods entrusted to railways for transportation by various departments is constantly increasing. The planned transport volume for March increased by 7.7% compared with February, which is more than any month last year. It is understood that the transport volume in April will be even greater than in March.
    Due to the large increase in freight volume, some areas have recently experienced insufficient railway loading and unloading capacity and local搬运 capacity. In stations such as Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Jinan, and Yucheng, the lack of loading and unloading forces has caused goods to not be unloaded in time and railway tracks to be blocked. Major freight stations within the Beijing Railway Sub-bureau, such as Huairou, Shahe, Changping, and Zhoukoudian, are loading about 100 fewer cars per day due to insufficient local automobile and horse-drawn carriage搬运 capacity. If this situation is not immediately improved, it will not only disrupt railway operations but also seriously hinder the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and the development of agriculture and industry.
    At present, some areas have already resolved this problem through local People's Committees in conjunction with railway departments. For example, Dezhou Station of the Beijing Railway Bureau once experienced a shortage of搬运 force outside the station. The local People's Committee mobilized women to participate in搬运 work, which solved the搬运 problem in this area. Huairou and Shahe stations lacked horse-drawn carriages for搬运 outside the station, so the Tongxian Special District transferred some horse-drawn carriages from other places to help, so that the sent goods could be transported out in time.
    In order to meet the ever-increasing transportation tasks, railway leaders in various regions should establish close contact with local People's Committees and take measures to improve and prevent the situation of insufficient loading/unloading and搬运 capacity. People's Committees in various regions should strengthen local搬运 work according to the increase in transport volume.

    加强铁路装卸和地方搬运工作
    王贵林
    随着社会主义建设高潮的来到，各部门委托铁路运送的货物量不断增长。三月份计划运量比二月份的运量增加7.7％，比去年任何一个月的运量都多。据了解，四月份运量将比三月份的运量更多。
    由于货运量增加的多，最近有些地区，就发生了铁路装卸能力和地方搬运能力不够的情况。天津、石家庄、济南、禹城等车站，因装卸力量不足，造成了货物不能及时卸车和车站股道堵塞的现象。北京铁路分局内的怀柔、沙河、昌平、周口店等主要货运站，因地方汽车、马车搬运能力不足，每日少装一百车左右。这种情况如不立即改善，不仅打乱了铁路作业，而且严重地阻碍了城乡物资交流和农业、工业的发展。
    目前有的地区已经由当地人民委员会会同铁路部门解决了这项问题。例如北京铁路管理局的德州站，曾一度发生站外搬运力不足的情况，当地人民委员会动员妇女参加搬运工作，解决了这个地区的搬运问题；怀柔、沙河两站缺少站外搬运的马车，通县专区由外地调来一部分马车帮忙，使发送货物得以及时运出。
    为了迎接日益增长的运输任务，各地铁路领导部门应该同当地人民委员会取得密切联系，采取措施，改善和防止这种装卸和搬运能力不足的情况；各地人民委员会应该根据运量增长情况，加强地方搬运工作。
