    The Struggle to Improve Quality on the Yangtze River Bridge Construction Site
    By our reporter Cao Baoming
    At noon on January 16th, the seventh caisson of the No. 1 pier of the Yangtze River Bridge was being filled with underwater concrete, when suddenly the mixer stopped working. The reason was that the concrete workers had all gone to the side to eat steamed buns. Peng Min, the director of the Engineering Bureau, who was inspecting the work, discovered this situation and ordered the workers to continue working immediately, but the concrete pouring had already been interrupted for twenty minutes. Fortunately, the river water had not yet seeped into the pipe, so a serious quality accident was avoided.
    Director Peng immediately talked to their squad leader. He asked, "When our entire staff guarantees to complete the Yangtze River Bridge ahead of schedule, are we building a high-quality bridge or a low-quality bridge that the people will despise?" He severely criticized this team's erroneous behavior of disregarding project quality and arbitrarily interrupting work.
    Immediately afterwards, the Party Committee's newspaper for the bridge construction site published an editorial entitled "Serious Incident," specifically criticizing this thought and behavior of neglecting quality. The radio station also repeatedly broadcast this matter to the workers. Several cartoons were also posted on the construction site, sending out a warning: Ignoring project quality now will bring serious disasters of collapsed bridges and overturned vehicles to the people in the future. When the workers learned about this, they also discussed it and were very angry. Some people said, "The Yangtze River Bridge we are building is not just a 'century-old plan,' but several 'century-old plans.' How can we be worthy of the Party and the people by doing this?"
    Why does the Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau take this twenty-minute work stoppage so seriously? This is because the pouring of underwater concrete cannot be interrupted for even a moment. If the work is interrupted and river water seeps into the pipe, the poured concrete pillar will not be a whole, but several unconnected sections. The entire weight of the pier rests on these pillars, how can these fragmented pillars bear it? At the same time, they had already experienced several quality accidents, such as external cracks, internal voids, and large honeycombs on the surface, when pouring concrete for the Yuehu Street overpass and the left bank approach bridge piers. Although the leaders of the Engineering Bureau repeatedly criticized them, the personnel concerned regarded it as a "small matter" and did not pay attention to it. Some even believed that "completing the quantity plan and neglecting some quality is more of an advantage than a disadvantage." Now that they are beginning to pour the concrete for the underwater piers, and the workers are enthusiastically striving to complete the bridge ahead of schedule, it is of decisive significance to promptly raise the issue of opposing neglect of quality and guide the enthusiasm of the masses to improve project quality.
    On the construction site, especially in the concrete team where quality accidents frequently occur, from within the Party to outside the Party, from leaders to the masses, a struggle against neglecting quality was launched. While criticizing erroneous ideas and handling this incident, they also took measures to plug other loopholes in their work. The first loophole was chaotic management and lack of dedicated personnel in charge. This time, it was decided to implement the principle of regional responsibility, with a chief foreman responsible for the piers on the water, taking full responsibility from preparing materials, assembling formwork, binding steel bars, allocating labor to inspecting quality. At the same time, three foremen and three technicians were assigned to work in shifts day and night, responsible for handling technical and other issues during the shift. The team leader and engineer were also assigned responsibilities. Secondly, in the past, some technicians believed that the technology of pouring concrete was simple, and did not seriously provide technical explanations to the workers. The workers did not understand the technical requirements and could not implement the technical operating procedures. This time, it was decided that before each project starts, the engineer must first explain the technology to the foreman, and then hold a general meeting to explain the technology to the workers; then the foreman will further explain the technology to the workers according to the situation in the team, so that each worker knows how they should work and what quality to achieve, and consciously implement the technical regulations. Thirdly, in the past, some staff members regarded ensuring project quality as the responsibility of the inspection team, pushing the project to the inspection team for inspection, and ignoring it themselves. This time, it was decided that each project must first be inspected by themselves and found to be qualified before being handed over to the bridge team's construction section for inspection, and then by the Engineering Bureau's inspection team. The construction section and the inspection team not only inspected the project itself, but also required each unit to write "inspection records," in order to check whether they had seriously inspected the project quality. They also established youth supervision posts to promptly issue warnings and criticisms on quality issues and promptly find ways to eliminate shortcomings, in response to the past phenomenon of weak political work.
    Before pouring the foundation and body of the No. 1 pier, the youth supervision post required technicians, foremen, etc., to start work only after technical explanations and various preparations were completed. During the pouring work, Soviet experts also personally took shifts. The workers carefully implemented the provisions of the technical regulations, spreading the concrete evenly and tamping it firmly. During the tense pouring, Soviet expert Dutchenko promptly discovered that the formwork had bulged inward because people had walked too much on the tie rod screws, and immediately took measures to remedy it. In this way, not only was the quality of the pier concrete guaranteed to be qualified, but also the production efficiency was improved. They poured 126 pans in the first shift, 139 pans in the second shift, 151 pans in the third shift, and 236 pans in the fourth shift. The No. 1 pier emerged from the water surface on February 19th. They recently poured eight caissons on the No. 2 pier, and the quality was also very good.
    Improving project quality is a regular task. The Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau has listed improving project quality as the first measure in this year's technical organization measures plan. They decided to set up Soviet expert suggestion record books in each team and on each pier, earnestly implement expert suggestions, and at the same time strengthen the quality inspection system for concealed projects, strengthen on-site testing and surveying work, etc. Recently, they are preparing to pour underwater concrete on the complex No. 2 pier, and the leader of the Soviet expert group, Sirin, is also personally in charge of this work. They are determined to achieve: completing a high-quality Yangtze River Bridge ahead of schedule.

    长江大桥工地上为提高质量的斗争
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    一月十六日中午，长江大桥一号桥墩的七号管柱正在紧张地浇灌水下混凝土，搅拌机突然不响了。原因是混凝土工人都拥到一边吃馒头去了。正在检查工作的工程局局长彭敏发现了这个情况，命令工人立即继续工作，但是混凝土浇灌已经中断了二十分钟。幸亏江水还未渗进管内，才没有造成严重的质量事故。
    彭局长马上找他们的小队长谈话。他问道：“我们全体职工保证提前建成长江大桥，是要建一座质量良好的大桥，还是建一座质量低劣，让人民唾骂我们的大桥？”他对这个小队不注意工程质量、擅自中断工作的错误行为，提出了严厉的批评。
    紧接着，大桥党委机关报发表了题为“严重事件”的社论，专门批判这种不重视质量的思想和行为。广播站也把这件事反复向工人们广播。工地上还贴出了几幅漫画，向大家发出警号：现在不重视工程质量，将来就会给人民带来桥塌、车翻的严重灾祸。工人们知道了这件事，也议论纷纷，非常气愤。有的人说：“我们修的长江大桥不只是一个‘百年大计’，是几个‘百年大计’。这样做，怎么对得起党和人民？”
    为什么长江大桥工程局对这个中断工作二十分钟的事情看得这样严重呢？这是因为浇灌水下混凝土一刻也不能中断。如果工作中断，江水渗进管内，浇出的混凝土柱子就不是一个整体，而是不相连结的几节。桥墩的全部重量都压在这些柱子上，这样支离破碎的柱子怎么能承载得起呢？同时，他们过去在浇灌月湖街跨线桥和左岸引桥桥墩的混凝土的时候，已经出过外部裂缝、内部空隙和表面有大蜂窝等多起质量事故。虽经工程局领导上一再批评，但是有关人员把它当做“小事”，没有加以重视。有的还认为“完成了数量计划，忽视些质量，是优点大于缺点”。现在，正开始浇灌水中的桥墩混凝土，职工群众已经热情奋发地在为提前建成大桥而奋斗，及时地提出反对忽视质量问题，把群众热情引导到提高工程质量上来，是具有决定性意义的。
    工地上，特别是在经常发生质量事故的混凝土中队里，从党内到党外，从领导到群众，展开了反对忽视质量的斗争。在批判错误思想和处理这次事件的同时，他们又针对工作中的其它漏洞，采取了堵塞这些漏洞的措施。第一个漏洞是管理紊乱，工作缺乏专人负责。这次就决定执行区域负责制的原则，水上的桥墩由一个主管领工员负责，从准备材料、拼装模型板、绑扎钢筋、调配劳动力到检查质量，全面负责到底。同时还配备三个领工员和三个技术员日夜轮流值班，负责处理当班的技术问题和其他问题。中队长和工程师也分工负责。其次，过去有的技术人员认为浇灌混凝土的技术简单，不认真向工人进行技术交底，工人不了解技术要求，不能执行技术操作规程。这次决定在每项工程开工以前，工程师必须先向领工员交底，再开大会向工人交底；然后领工员再根据组里的情况，进一步向工人交底，使每个工人都知道自己应怎样工作和达到什么样的质量，自觉地贯彻执行技术规程。第三，过去有的工作人员把保证工程质量看做是检查组的事，把工程推给检查组去检查，自己不管。这次就决定每项工作都先由自己检查合格以后，才交给桥队施工科检查，然后再由工程局检查组检查。施工科和检查组不仅检查工程本身，还要各单位写“检查纪录簿”，借以检查他们是否认真检查了工程质量。他们还针对过去政治工作薄弱的现象，成立了青年监督岗，对质量问题随时发出警报和批评，及时设法消除缺点。
    在浇灌一号桥墩基础和墩身之前，青年监督岗就要求技术人员、领工员等在做好了技术交底和各项准备工作后，才开始工作。在浇灌工作中，苏联专家也亲自值班。工人们都认真执行技术规程的规定，把混凝土铺得很均匀，捣得很结实。正在紧张浇灌的时候，苏联专家杜特琴柯又及时查出因为人们在拉杆螺丝上走动太多，使模型板向里鼓起来了，立即采取措施加以补救。这样一来，不仅保证了桥墩混凝土质量合格，并且提高了生产效率。他们第一班浇126盘，第二班浇139盘，第三班浇151盘，第四班浇236盘。一号墩在二月十九日修出了水面。他们最近在二号墩上浇灌了八根管柱，质量也很好。
    提高工程质量，是经常性的工作。长江大桥工程局在今年的技术组织措施计划中，把提高工程质量列为第一项措施。他们决定在各中队和各个墩上设置苏联专家建议纪录簿，认真执行专家建议，同时加强隐蔽工程的质量检查制度，加强现场试验工作和测量工作等等。最近，他们正准备在情况复杂的二号墩浇灌水下混凝土，苏联专家组长西林也亲自掌握这项工作。他们决心要作到：提前建成一条质量良好的长江大桥。
