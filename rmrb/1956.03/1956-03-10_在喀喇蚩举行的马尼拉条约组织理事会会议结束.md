Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 9th: A meeting of the Manila Treaty Organization Council held in Karachi since March 6th, concluded on March 8th.

    The communique issued after the meeting emphasized that the council considered it necessary to establish and maintain a “strong deterrent force.” In addition, the communique also vigorously boasted about the military bloc’s activities over the past year in training and equipping the armed forces of member states, holding military exercises, and suppressing national liberation movements in Asian countries in the name of "anti-subversion." All this shows that the purpose of this military bloc is not to "maintain peace" as it proclaims, but to prepare for war and serve the US policy of aggression and enslavement of the Asian people.

    The communique showed that this military bloc wants to openly interfere in the affairs of Asian countries. It said that the council members declared that their governments "recognize that Pakistan's sovereignty extends to the Durand Line, the international border between Pakistan and Afghanistan," and stated that the "treaty area" of the Manila military bloc includes the area up to that line. The Afghan Foreign Ministry, on the eve of the Karachi meeting, announced that Afghanistan does not recognize the Durand Line as the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. The communique also said that they stated "the need to resolve the Kashmir issue through the United Nations or direct negotiations."

    The final part of the communique revealed that the meeting passed a resolution to establish a "research center" to "provide reports on current developments in communist activities," which is actually a euphemism for an international espionage center planning to suppress national liberation movements in Asian countries.

    Sources revealed that US Secretary of State Dulles continued to advocate the "deterrence" policy at the meeting. He said that the basis of the US plan in Asia is "a strong strategic strike force." He also boasted that the US armed forces currently stationed in Southeast Asia are stronger than the US forces stationed in the Pacific during World War II. Dulles called on the Asian member states of the Manila Treaty Organization to establish "strong national forces." He also suggested establishing a "supreme command" for this military bloc, and the meeting decided to refer this suggestion to the Manila Treaty Organization's permanent committee to be established in Bangkok for discussion.

    French Foreign Minister Pineau said at the meeting that France would "tirelessly emphasize" the economic side of the Manila Treaty Organization. Representatives of other countries at the meeting also emphasized the need for "economic development" in Southeast Asia. However, judging from the final communique, the meeting was limited to agreeing that economic experts should "continue to study plans for economic issues."

    According to United Press reporter James Pury, the wording of the meeting's communique was still being revised a quarter of an hour before the meeting closed due to differences of opinion between Dulles and other representatives.

### 在喀喇蚩举行的马尼拉条约组织理事会会议结束

    在喀喇蚩举行的马尼拉条约组织理事会会议结束
    新华社新德里9日电　喀喇蚩消息：3月6日起在喀喇蚩举行的马尼拉条约组织理事会会议已经在3月8日结束。
    会后发表的公报强调说，理事会认为有必要建立和维持“强大的威慑力量”。此外，公报也竭力吹嘘这个军事集团成立一年以来在训练和装备成员国的军队、举行军事演习、以及以“反颠复”为名镇压亚洲国家民族解放运动等各方面的活动。这些都说明这个军事集团的宗旨并不是像它自己所宣布的那样是为了“维持和平”，而是为了准备战争，替美国侵略和奴役亚洲人民的政策服务。
    公报表明，这个军事集团想公开干涉亚洲国家的事务。它说，理事会的理事们宣布他们的政府“承认巴基斯坦的主权一直伸展到巴基斯坦和阿富汗之间的国际边界杜朗线”，并且声明马尼拉军事集团的“条约地区”包括直到那条线为止的地区。而阿富汗外交部在喀喇蚩会议前夕曾经宣布，阿富汗并不承认杜朗线为巴阿之间的边界。公报还说，他们声明“需要通过联合国或直接谈判”来解决克什米尔问题。
    公报的最后部分透露，会议通过要设立一个“提供关于共产党活动当前发展情况的报告”的“研究工作中心”，这实际上是一个策划镇压亚洲各国民族解放运动的国际间谍中心的别名。
    消息透露，美国国务卿杜勒斯在会上继续鼓吹“威慑”政策。他说，美国在亚洲的计划的基础就是“一支强有力的战略攻击部队”。他并且吹嘘，现在驻扎在东南亚地区的美国武装部队就实力来说，超过美国在第二次世界大战期间驻扎在太平洋地区的力量。杜勒斯要求马尼拉条约集团的亚洲成员国建立“强有力的本国部队”。他还建议成立这个军事集团的“最高司令部”，会议决定把这个建议移交给将在曼谷设立的马尼拉条约组织常设委员会讨论。
    法国外交部长比诺在会上说，法国将 “永不厌烦地强调”马尼拉条约组织的经济一面。其他一些国家的代表在会上也强调东南亚地区的“经济发展”的需要。然而，从最后的公报看来，会议只限于同意由经济专家们去“继续研究经济问题的计划”。
    据合众社记者詹姆斯·伯里报道，由于杜勒斯同其他代表之间的意见分歧，会议公报在会议闭幕前一刻钟还在修改措词。
