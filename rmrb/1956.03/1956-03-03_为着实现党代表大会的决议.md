    To Implement the Resolutions of the Party Congress
    By Li He, Our Correspondent in the Soviet Union
    The historically significant 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) has concluded. Delegates have returned to their respective regions to convey the results of the Congress. The resolutions and spirit of the CPSU's 20th Congress are increasingly resonating with the people. "We support the resolutions of the CPSU's 20th Congress," "We will implement the resolutions of the CPSU's 20th Congress" – from the Far East to the Baltic coast, from Central Asia to the Arctic Circle, a unified voice resounds across the Soviet Union, representing the direction of action for the Soviet people today. In the fields of Ukraine, the snow is beginning to melt under the sunlight. Agricultural workers are diligently preparing for spring plowing, marking the beginning of the early implementation of the CPSU's 20th Congress's task of developing agriculture. Tractor and agricultural machinery repairs are progressing faster and better than last year throughout the republic. Nearly a thousand Machine Tractor Stations and 250 state farms had already completed the repair of tractors and their towed implements by the opening of the CPSU's 20th Congress, with the remaining stations and farms now completing their machine repairs. Collective farms and state farms are engaged in seed cleaning and germination testing, paying particular attention to the preparation of corn seeds. The corn planting area this year will be larger than last year. Many collective farms will sow hybrid corn seeds this year.

    Factories and construction sites, mines and rural areas in Siberia are experiencing a surge of political and labor enthusiasm. The massive plan to develop the resources of the Soviet East has particularly excited the people of Siberia. At the site of the future 3.2 million kilowatt Krasnoyarsk Hydroelectric Power Station, geological survey teams continue to work despite the severe cold, wind, and snow. Twenty-five drilling rigs are operating around the clock. Among these drilling towers, the survey team and the first batch of construction team personnel held a conference. Foreman Bondarenko said at the conference: "The Communist Party bravely and confidently leads the Soviet people forward to communism. We must repay the Party's care for the further prosperity of the country and for us with selfless labor." He proposed that the survey team conduct a competition to complete the exploration work at the hydroelectric station site two months ahead of schedule. This proposal was supported by the conference. Construction workers are also striving to complete the 1956 plan ahead of schedule.

    During the competition to celebrate the CPSU's 20th Congress, the Kuznetsk Metallurgical Combine in Kuzbass greatly increased the productivity of its existing equipment. The No. 1 open-hearth furnace workshop overfulfilled its task by producing more than 7,500 tons of steel in two months. At a mass rally celebrating the successful conclusion of the CPSU's 20th Congress, steelworkers pledged to strive for new achievements in the competition to complete the 1956 plan ahead of schedule. All coal mines under the Kuzbass Coal Mining Combine completed their February plans, exceeding production by 70,000 tons of coal in a month. Compared to December of last year, the average daily coal production increased by 12,400 tons. Inspired by the resolutions of the CPSU's 20th Congress, the miners are determined to explore new potentials, improve working methods, and adopt more advanced technology.

    The general staff meeting held at the Kubaevna Fine Wool Factory in Moscow Oblast reflected the determination of Soviet workers to turn the Communist Party's call into reality. At the staff meeting, Rozhnieva, a delegate to the CPSU's 20th Congress, spoke about the results of the Congress. This famous female worker is now the deputy foreman of the spinning workshop at the Kubaevna factory. She said, "Can we today assure the Party, the Party's Leninist Central Committee, and the motherland that we will complete the tasks of the Sixth Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and well? I think we can. We have all the necessary conditions for smooth work and enormous potential. If we pay attention to our work wholeheartedly and with a sense of ownership, and if we always remember that every little bit counts, then this potential is inexhaustible." Rozhnieva cited many potentials, such as the fact that many lathes could be updated and many raw materials could be saved. She announced the decision of her group: by enriching work time and increasing machine speed, they will overproduce 85 tons of yarn in 1956, enough to weave 68,000 meters of tweed. Rozhnieva's initiative was supported by all the factory workers. This initiative is the competition to enrich working time and increase machine speed. The staff meeting decided: all factory workers guarantee to complete the 1956 plan ahead of schedule, overproducing 100,000 meters of tweed; increase labor productivity by 30%; update 16 ring spinning machines; update crank looms; save 25 tons of wool, and reduce raw material losses by another 15% beyond the plan; and save 1.5 million rubles from over-plan cost reductions. Rozhnieva's initiative will soon be promoted to other textile factories in the Soviet Union.

    "What the Party says, will be done," is a popular saying in the Soviet Union. It best illustrates the enthusiastic mood of the Soviet people today, after the CPSU's 20th Congress, inspired by the Party Congress's wise resolutions and the magnificent picture of the Sixth Five-Year Plan.

    为着实现党代表大会的决议
    本报驻苏联记者　李何
    具有历史意义的苏共第二十次代表大会开过了。代表们纷纷回到各处去传达代表大会的结果了。苏共第二十次代表大会的决议和精神越来越深入人心了。“我们拥护苏共第二十次代表大会的决议”，“我们要实现苏共第二十次代表大会的决议”，——从远东到波罗的海沿岸，从中亚到北极圈，苏联全国连绵不绝地响动着一致的声音，那是今天苏联人民的行动方向。乌克兰田野积雪在阳光下开始融化。农业劳动者在很好地准备春耕，把这作为提早实现苏共第二十次代表大会关于发展农业的任务的开头。全共和国的拖拉机和农业机械比去年更快更好地修理着。近千个机器拖拉机站和250个国营农场在苏共第二十次代表大会开幕时已经完成拖拉机及其牵引的农具的修理，其余的拖拉机站和国营农场现在正完成机器的修理。集体农庄和国营农场进行着清选种子和检查种子的发芽率的工作，特别注意准备玉米种子。今年玉米播种面积将比去年多。许多集体农庄今年将播种杂交的玉米种子。
    西伯利亚的工厂和工地，矿山和农村，高涨着政治和劳动的热情。开发苏联东部富源的巨大计划使西伯利亚人们特别兴奋。在未来320万瓩的克拉斯诺雅尔斯克水电站的所在地，地质探测队冒着严寒和风雪继续工作。25台钻探机昼夜不停地转动着。就在这些钻探塔架当中，探测队和第一批建筑队的人员们举行了大会。值班工长邦达连科在大会上说：“共产党勇敢地有信心地引导苏联人民向共产主义前进。我们要以忘我的劳动报答党对国家的进一步繁荣和对我们的关怀。”他提议探测队进行竞赛，争取提早两个月完成水电站所在地的探测工作。这个建议得到大会的支持。建筑职工也争取提早完成1956年计划。
    库兹巴斯的库兹?次克钢铁联合企业在祝贺苏共第二十次代表大会的竞赛期间大大提高了现有设备的生产率。第一号平炉车间在两个月中超过任务多炼了7，500吨以上的钢。在庆祝苏共第二十次代表大会胜利结束的群众大会上，钢铁工人们保证在提早完成1956年计划的竞赛中争取新的成就。库兹巴斯煤矿联合企业的所有煤矿都完成了2月计划，一个月中超额增产了7万吨煤。与去年12月比较，每昼夜平均采煤量增加了12，400吨。为苏共第二十次代表大会决议所鼓舞的矿工们，决心发掘新潜力，改进劳动方法，更多采用先进
  技术。
    莫斯科州库巴汶细呢工厂举行了全体职工大会，它反映了苏联劳动者要把共产党的号召变为现实的决心。在职工大会上，参加苏共第二十次代表大会的代表罗日聂娃谈了代表大会的结果。这位有名的女工现在是库巴汶厂纺纱间副工长。她说：“我们今天能不能向党、向党的列宁式中央委员会、向祖国保证我们将提早地好好地完成第六个五年计划的任务呢？我想，我们能。我们有一切顺利地工作的必要条件，有巨大的潜力。要是用心地、以主人翁态度注意自己的工作，要是永远记住积少成多，那么这些潜力是用不尽的。”罗日聂娃举出许多潜力，例如许多车床可以更新，许多原料可以节约。她宣布了自己一个组的决定：用充实工作时间和提高机器速度的方法，在1956年将超额增产85吨纱，足够织68，000公尺呢子。罗日聂娃的倡议受到了全厂职工的支持。这个倡议就是进行充实工作时间和提高机器速度的竞赛。职工大会决定：全厂职工保证提早完成1956年计划，超计划增产10万公尺呢子；提高劳动生产率30％，更新16台环式纺纱机；更新曲柄织布机；节约25吨毛，比计划再减少15％原料损失；从超计划降低成本节约150万卢布。罗日聂娃的倡议很快将推广到苏联其他纺织厂去。
    “党说怎样，就会是怎样”，这是在苏联流行的一句话。它最好说明今天，在苏共第二十次代表大会以后，苏联人民为党代表大会的英明决议和第六个五年计划的雄伟图景所鼓舞的热烈心情。
