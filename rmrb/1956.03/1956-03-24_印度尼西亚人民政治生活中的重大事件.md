    A Major Event in the Political Life of the Indonesian People

    The new parliament produced by the first general election after the founding of the Republic of Indonesia is scheduled to be established on March 24th. The new cabinet led by the Indonesian Nationalist Party, the largest party in Indonesia, will also hold its inauguration ceremony on the same day. This is a major event in the current political life of the Indonesian people.

    On August 17, 1945, Indonesia declared its independence, becoming an important new country in Asia. Western colonialist forces have tried every possible means to undermine this young republic. The Indonesian people have encountered many setbacks and difficulties in maintaining their national independence. However, Western colonialist forces have not achieved their goals. The Republic of Indonesia continues to grow and consolidate. The 78 million Indonesian people must control their own destiny.

    On September 29th of last year, Indonesia held its first parliamentary election. According to the official announcement by the Indonesian Central Election Committee on March 1st of this year, the forces advocating national unity and pursuing an independent foreign policy have won the support of the majority of voters. This has greatly changed the balance of power in the original provisional parliament. This is a major victory for the national democratic forces of Indonesia. Certain groups in Western countries had hoped that the Indonesian election would create a situation favorable to them. The results of the general election "shocked" and "disappointed" them.

    The victory of the Indonesian national democratic forces in the general election will of course have a positive impact on the Indonesian government's domestic and foreign policies. The program proposed by Sastroamidjojo, who was entrusted by President Sukarno to form a new government, has aroused great interest and widespread attention. This program stipulates the implementation of an active independent foreign policy, the promotion of world peace, and the implementation of the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference. This program stipulates the implementation of the abolition of the Round Table Conference agreements and the realization of de facto authority over West Irian. This program stipulates the formulation of a five-year plan for the development of industrial construction, the transformation of the colonial economic structure into a national economy, the protection of national industries, the improvement of farmers' lives, and the improvement of labor conditions, etc. It can be seen that this is a program that demands the safeguarding of national sovereignty and national independence; it is a program that demands the elimination of the shackles of colonialism in the economy and the move towards independent development; it is also a program that demands the implementation of the principles of peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation in accordance with the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference. This program is in the interests of the Indonesian people and also in the interests of Asian peace.

    The government formed by Sastroamidjojo takes office today. It is hoped that the new cabinet will take firm steps to implement the program that has been agreed upon by all parties, so as to give play to Indonesia's important role in international politics.

    The Chinese people congratulate the new Indonesian parliament, believing that this is an important sign of the progress of the Indonesian people's struggle to consolidate national unity, oppose colonialism, and safeguard the cause of peace.

    The Chinese people welcome the new Indonesian cabinet. The friendly and cooperative relations between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia have been greatly developed during the first term of Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo. We believe that the new Sastroamidjojo government will further strengthen the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries and make greater contributions to the common cause of implementing the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference, carrying forward the Bandung spirit, and safeguarding Asian peace.

### 印度尼西亚人民政治生活中的重大事件

    印度尼西亚人民政治生活中的重大事件
    印度尼西亚共和国成立后第一次普选所产生的新国会，定于三月二十四日成立。由印度尼西亚第一大党印度尼西亚国民党所领导的新内阁，也将在同一天举行就职典礼。这是目前印度尼西亚人民政治生活中的重大事件。
    1945年8月17日，印度尼西亚宣布独立，成为亚洲的一个重要的新国家。西方殖民主义势力曾经千方百计地损害这个年青的共和国。印度尼西亚人民在维护自己的民族独立的道路上，曾经遭遇到许多锉折和困难。但是，西方殖民主义势力并没有达到他们的目的。印度尼西亚共和国继续成长和巩固。七千八百万的印度尼西亚人民一定要掌握自己的命运。
    去年九月二十九日，印度尼西亚举行第一次国会选举。据印度尼西亚中央选举委员会今年三月一日正式公布普选的结果，主张民族团结和奉行独立外交政策的力量获得了大多数选民的拥护。这样就大大改变了原来在临时国会中力量的对比。这是印度尼西亚民族民主力量的一个重大胜利。西方国家中的某些集团曾经希望印度尼西亚的选举会造成有利于他们的形势。普选的结果却使他们感到“震惊”和“失望”。
    印度尼西亚民族民主力量在普选中取得的胜利，对印度尼西亚政府的对内政策和对外政策，当然会发生积极的影响。受苏加诺总统委托组织新政府的沙斯特罗阿米佐约提出的政纲，引起了人们极大的兴趣和广泛的注意。这个政纲规定要执行积极的独立外交政策，促进世界和平，实施亚非会议的决议。这个政纲规定要实施废除圆桌会议各项协定，实现对西伊里安的事实上的权威。这个政纲规定要订出一个发展工业建设的五年计划，要把殖民地的经济结构改为民族经济，要保护民族工业，提高农民生活和改善劳工条件等等。可以看出，这是一个要求维护国家主权和民族独立的政纲；是一个要求在经济上摆脱殖民主义桎梏、走向独立发展的政纲；这也是一个要求根据亚非会议决议、实行和平共处原则和友好合作政策的政纲。这个政纲符合印度尼西亚人民的利益，也符合亚洲和平的利益。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约所组成的政府今天就职了。人们希望新内阁将采取坚定的步骤，来执行已为各方面所同意的政纲，以发挥印度尼西亚在国际政治中的重要作用。
    中国人民对印度尼西亚的新国会表示祝贺，认为这是印度尼西亚人民为巩固民族团结、反对殖民主义和维护和平事业所进行的斗争向前发展的一个重要标志。
    中国人民对印度尼西亚新内阁表示欢迎。中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国两国之间的友好合作关系，曾经在沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理第一次组阁期间获得很大的发展。我们相信，新的沙斯特罗阿米佐约政府将使我们两国之间的友好合作关系进一步加强，对贯彻亚非会议决议、发扬万隆精神和维护亚洲和平的共同事业，作出更大的贡献。
