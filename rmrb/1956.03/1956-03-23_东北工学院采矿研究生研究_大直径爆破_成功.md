Northeast Institute of Technology Mining Department Tunneling Teaching and Research Group graduate student Liu Qingrong's research on the "large diameter blasting" method has been successful. According to the Benxi Nanfen Fire-Resistant Clay Mine's experimental summary to the school at the end of February, the "large diameter blasting" method reduced explosive consumption by 31.6% and increased resource utilization by 44.7% in clay mining. When this method was tested at the Benxi Coal Mine, it was also more efficient than "small diameter blasting" in rock mountain tunneling.

Chinese mines generally use "small diameter blasting" with explosive packages of 32 mm or less in diameter. Liu Qingrong expanded the diameter of these explosive packages to 38 mm to 50 mm, concentrating the blasting power. After more than 200 experiments, tunneling efficiency increased by an average of 10%, and explosive consumption decreased by an average of 20%.

The Capital Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry has issued instructions requiring mines in various regions to adopt "large diameter blasting." (Xinhua News Agency)

    东北工学院采矿研究生研究“大直径爆破”成功
    东北工学院采矿系井巷教研组研究生刘清荣研究的“大直径爆破”方法成功。根据本溪南芬耐火粘土矿在二月底给学校的试验总结证明，用“大直径爆破”法，在粘土掘进方面，降低了炸药消耗量31.6％，提高资源利用率44.7％。这个方法在本溪煤矿试验时，对岩山掘进也比“小直径爆破”效率高。
    我国矿山一般都采用药包直径在三十二公厘以内的“小直径爆破”，刘清荣把这种炸药包的直径扩大到三十八公厘到五十公厘，爆破能力集中，经过二百多次试验，掘进效率平均提高10％，炸药消耗量平均降低20％。
    煤炭工业部基本建设总局已经发出指示，要求各地矿山采用“大直径爆破”。（据新华社讯）
