Learn Forestry Technology, March to Barren Mountains and Wastelands, and Strive to Green the Motherland (Abstract)
Luo Yuchuan, Vice Minister of Forestry

The following is an abstract of the report "Learn Forestry Technology, March to Barren Mountains and Wastelands, and Strive to Green the Motherland" by Luo Yuchuan, Vice Minister of Forestry, at the Afforestation Conference of Five Provinces (Regions):

In his report, Luo Yuchuan first discussed the current state of forests in China and the preliminary plan for afforestation in 12 years. He said that as one of the important resources necessary for national construction and people's livelihood and production, China's existing forests, a valuable resource that was originally very rich in history, have been left too little due to the long-term destruction by the reactionary ruling class. At present, the country only has more than 1.14 billion mu of forests, accounting for only 7.9% of the total land area. The average per capita is less than two mu, while there are more than 4.5 billion mu of barren mountains and wastelands, about half of which need to be afforested. China's existing forests are mainly distributed in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces in Northeast China and eastern Inner Mongolia, followed by mountainous areas scattered in more than a dozen provinces in the south. Due to the uneven distribution of forests, North China, Northwest China, and many other regions lack forests, with bare mountains and ridges everywhere, serious soil erosion, and imbalanced climate, resulting in natural disasters such as floods, droughts, winds, sand, and hail, which seriously endanger agricultural production.

Due to the scarcity of forests and their uneven distribution, there are also certain difficulties in supplying timber to support socialist industrialization. The country's existing timber reserves are about 4.9 billion cubic meters, averaging only about 8 cubic meters per person. In comparison, the Soviet Union's annual timber felling in recent years has averaged nearly 2 cubic meters per person. As everyone knows, timber is an important material for industrial construction, second only to steel. With the development of China's economic construction, the demand for timber will inevitably increase greatly. For example, after 12 years, the state plans to mine 300 million tons of coal annually, which requires more than 8.4 million cubic meters of mine props (about 700 million 6-foot-long mine props); for example, timber is the main raw material for papermaking. In the Soviet Union, 98% of papermaking uses timber. Due to the shortage of timber in China, it is impossible to use timber for papermaking on a large scale. At present, only about 30% uses timber, and the papermaking industry is far from catching up with the needs. In the future, 600 million people in the country will need to read books and newspapers and write, which requires a lot of paper. For example, if 3 million tons are needed annually, and 80% uses timber as raw material, it requires more than 10 million cubic meters, equivalent to the total national felling volume in 1952. In addition, many important industrial raw materials, such as rubber, rayon, oils and fats, and alcohol, as well as various timber required for people's lives, must be supplied by China's existing forests. This shows the serious situation of insufficient forests in China. Secondly, most of the timber for national industrial and defense construction is supplied by Northeast China and Inner Mongolia, which requires transportation of 5,000 miles for long distances, and generally more than 3,000 miles. Long-distance transportation of timber increases the cost of timber, which also raises the prices of related industrial products and the cost of various constructions.

So what should we do? It is necessary to conscientiously implement the provisions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on greening all barren mountains and wastelands within 12 years, and it is necessary to accelerate China's greening construction. The Ministry of Forestry and the forestry departments of various provinces have recently jointly formulated a preliminary draft of the greening construction plan in accordance with the requirements of national economic development and in conjunction with the economic and natural conditions of various regions, and it is expected that about 1.57 billion mu of barren mountains and wastelands that can be greened nationwide will be mainly relied on the masses to systematically create forests within 12 years (including about 280 million mu that can become forests after closing mountains for afforestation). Among them, there are about 1 billion mu of timber forests. The plan also includes creating various protection forests and developing a large number of economic trees such as mulberry, oak, oil plants, fruit trees, and tea. And it is required that all railways, highways, major roads, and riverbanks across the country, as well as around cities and villages, should complete various greening tasks as soon as possible according to needs and possibilities.

After the implementation of this plan, except for Tibet, Xinjiang, Qinghai, and other places, the forest cover rate in most other provinces can reach about 30%, some about 20%, and a few about 10%. These forests can play a role in regulating the climate, maintaining water and soil, and stabilizing bumper harvests in farmland, and increase the country's timber storage by about 9 billion cubic meters, which can basically meet the needs of the country and people for timber in a few years. More than 60 million mu of oil tea forests will be built. After the forests are formed, plus the existing 19 million mu, more than 2.1 billion jin of oil can be produced annually, which can solve the edible oil problem for more than 180 million people.

The plan also made appropriate provisions for the greening tasks in various regions:

Heilongjiang, Jilin, and eastern Inner Mongolia have more existing forests. In addition to strengthening the protection and management of existing forests, they should actively carry out the renewal of new and old logging sites and systematically continue to build protection forests and afforestation on barren mountains.

Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Liaoning, Shaanxi, and eastern Gansu and other regions have many barren mountains and wastelands, serious soil erosion, and severe disasters such as floods, droughts, winds, and sand. The focus should be on building water and soil conservation forests, sand-fixation forests, and field protection forests, and selecting suitable large mountainous areas to delineate a large area to create timber forests, striving to achieve local self-sufficiency in timber in the future.

Xinjiang, Qinghai, western Inner Mongolia, and western Gansu have scarce rainfall, severe wind and sand, and a large area of reclaimable wasteland. In addition to protecting existing forests to regulate water sources, it is also necessary to adapt to the development of the entire economic construction, actively create sand-prevention forests and field protection forests, and green all possible barren mountains and wastelands to gradually expand water source forests, ensure bumper harvests in agriculture, and obtain materials locally for future industry.

The southern provinces have abundant rainfall, a warm climate, and fast tree growth. In addition to strengthening the protection and management of original forests, they should make full use of the superior conditions here, vigorously create timber forests, and systematically develop various special economic forests. Combined with maintaining water and soil, establish a national timber base, and supply various forest products according to the future needs of the country.

In addition, silkworm farming, mulberry planting, fruits, mountain fruits, yams, etc. should be developed in various places, and unified arrangements should be made in the plan.

After the national greening construction plan is implemented, it can change the face of China's nature, and barren mountains and ridges will become beautiful rivers and mountains.

Luo Yuchuan then talked about the types of forests and tree species in the middle reaches of the Yellow River.

He first talked about the great plan that China has formulated to eradicate the harm of the Yellow River and develop the water conservancy of the Yellow River. He said that the key to implementing this plan is the control of sediment in the Yellow River. Only by doing a good job in water and soil conservation in the loess area and keeping the loess and rainwater on the farmland can we eliminate the disasters in the Yellow River basin and change the natural conditions in the Yellow River basin. There are many ways to avoid rainwater flowing along the ground, and the most economical and effective way is to create water and soil conservation forests. Because forests are the best water conservation tools. Wherever there are trees, we can see the role of forests in maintaining water and soil. Therefore, in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, especially in the Loess Plateau, large-scale afforestation should be carried out in accordance with water and soil conservation and economic benefits. First of all, it should be planned according to the following types according to the terrain and soil erosion:

(1) Hilly gully area: In this type of area, hills overlap, gullies are crisscrossed, slopes are steep, flows are rapid, and soil erosion is serious. The main problem in controlling soil erosion is the transformation and utilization of gullies. To achieve the purpose of treating gullies, it is necessary to protect slopes, consolidate gullies, and protect ridges and mounds. If these tasks are done well, soil erosion can be fundamentally controlled. Therefore, in this area, the following types of protection forests should be created according to the specific situation: slope protection forests, gully bottom anti-erosion forests, gully head protection forests, water flow regulation forest belts, ridge and mound afforestation, bank protection forests, and beach afforestation.

The hilly gully area has the most serious soil erosion and the largest area. The amount of sediment scouring per square kilometer per year is 5,000 to 10,000 tons (part of the area has an annual rainfall of less than 300 mm, and the amount of sediment scouring per year is 1,000 to 2,000 tons). In this area, according to the different amount of sediment scouring, after Shaanbei and western Jinxi (the most serious soil erosion) build water and soil conservation forests, the forest cover rate (that is, the percentage of forest land area to the total land area after afforestation) should reach about 40%; the water and soil erosion in the upper reaches of the Yanhe River, Jinghe River, Beiluo River, Wuding River, and the Shanshui River and Zuli River basins in northeastern Gansu is second only to the previous area, and the forest cover rate should be about 30% after building water and soil conservation forests; the water and soil erosion in the Weihe River, Fenhe River basin, southern Jin, western Yu, and the Yihe River and Nanluo River basin is second only to the previous area, and the forest cover rate should be 8%.

(2) Plateau gully area: In this type of area, soil erosion is severe, the original surface is gradually broken, and the gully area is gradually expanding. For example, the gully density of the Dongzhiyuan gully in Longdong, Gansu has reached 2 kilometers per square kilometer, and the gully area has accounted for more than 50% of the total land area. Therefore, the main problem of soil erosion is also the problem of gully management. In this area, except for the lack of ridge and mound land and hilly land, the rest is the same as the hilly gully area. However, in order to prevent drought, some places need to build farmland protection forests on the original surface.

Soil erosion in the plateau gully area is second only to the hilly gully area, and the area is smaller. The amount of sediment scouring per square kilometer per year is 4,000 to 9,000 tons. This area includes the Loess Plateau gully area in the middle and lower reaches of the Hehe River and Beiluo River. After afforestation, the forest cover rate should be about 28%.

(3) Soil and stone mountain area: This type of area has more stones and less soil, less cultivated land, and frequent mountain floods. In this area, afforestation is mainly carried out on mountains, steep slopes, and barren gullies where afforestation conditions exist; where afforestation is not possible, mountains should be closed first to cultivate afforestation conditions.

The soil and stone mountain area includes the mountainous area in the middle reaches of the Yellow River. The area is second only to the hilly gully area. The amount of sediment scouring per square kilometer per year is 1,000 to 5,000 tons (including the part of the residual forest area with slight soil erosion). More afforestation should be carried out in this area. After afforestation, the forest cover rate can be more than 40%.

(4) Sandy area: The climate is dry, trees are sparse, and mobile sand moves rapidly, often burying farmland and villages, and blocking roads and rivers. The main purpose is to create windbreak and sand-fixation forests, farmland protection forests, and bank protection forests.

The sandy area includes the sandy area along the edge of the Yikezhao League in the northern Yellow River basin. The area is small (referring to the sandy area within the Yellow River basin). Although the amount of sediment flowing into the Yellow River every year is not large, the harm of flowing sand is serious. The planned forest cover rate is about 40%.

(5) Reservoirs will be built successively on the main and tributaries of the Yellow River, especially the Sanmenxia Reservoir, which has been decided to start construction in advance and complete it in advance. In order to protect the reservoir, it is necessary to greatly accelerate the construction of reservoir protection forests, and the relevant provinces and counties should regard it as a key project and complete it as soon as possible.

Secondly, it is necessary to select suitable tree species: the greening construction in the Loess Plateau must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of water and soil conservation and in line with the needs of the local people. This area generally lacks fuel, fertilizer, and feed. In particular, the lack of fuel has become a major difficulty in the lives of the people in the middle reaches of the Yellow River. Therefore, when afforestation, it is necessary to combine water and soil conservation with firewood forests, or select fast-growing tree species such as locust, ailanthus, poplar, and willow to solve the fuel problem. In addition, in order to supply timber for future construction in the Northwest and the timber needed by the masses, timber tree species such as pine, oak, and water tung (small-leaved poplar) can also be selected.

The climate in the middle reaches of the Yellow River is mild and dry, and the soil is deep and loose, which is suitable for the development of fruit trees and mulberry trees. Fruits and silk are important side businesses for farmers, and fruits and silk are an important export commodity in China. It can be seen that in the afforestation work in the Yellow River basin, it is very necessary to select a certain proportion of fruit trees and mulberry trees in combination with the construction of water and soil conservation forests.

Water and soil conservation forests should generally be mixed with arbor and shrub. Because in this way, on the one hand, the crowns of young trees can be quickly connected (closed), promoting the growth of young forests, and on the other hand, the young forests can quickly play the role of water storage and soil conservation. In short, the selection of tree species should be based on local natural conditions, in accordance with the principle of combining the long-term interests of the country with the current interests of the masses, and starting from solving the current urgent needs of the masses to combine with the long-term interests. Therefore, priority should be given to fast-growing, early-yielding, and water-conserving and soil-conserving trees (including a certain proportion of fruit trees and mulberry trees, etc.) and beneficial shrubs. The main trees in the middle reaches of the Yellow River are locust, elm, mulberry, apricot, walnut, oak, poplar, willow, pine, cypress, etc., and shrubs include tamarisk, caragana, sea buckthorn, lespedeza, amorpha, wolfberry root, sand willow (suitable for sandy areas, etc.).

Regarding doing a good job in greening planning and guaranteeing quality, Luo Yuchuan pointed out that provinces, counties, and townships can refer to the above-mentioned classification of type areas, the planning of forest types and tree species, and the preliminary indicators of forest cover rate to be achieved after afforestation, and conduct planning throughout the basin (including the main and tributaries of the Yellow River and larger gullies), the whole province, the whole county, and the whole township, combining agriculture, animal husbandry, and water conservancy measures, and do a good job of greening planning in the production plan. When planning, there should not only be a total completion period, but also annual requirements for annual implementation. Generally speaking, areas with better natural conditions and larger populations can progress faster, and areas with poor conditions should pay attention to accumulating experience, promoting experience, and doing various preparations in the first one or two years.

When talking about the issue of guaranteeing quality, Luo Yuchuan said that carrying out a large-scale afforestation movement must pay attention to the issue of afforestation quality. Improving afforestation quality is to ensure planting, survival, growth, and formation of forests, and to correct the phenomenon of low afforestation survival rates and poor growth of young forests in the past. The so-called afforestation does not only refer to "sowing, planting seedlings, and inserting cuttings", it includes several major processes such as planning and design, seed collection, seedling raising, land preparation, planting, and nurturing and protection, and continues until the forest trees are closed. The Ministry of Forestry has recently formulated two technical regulations for afforestation and seedling raising, and everyone can study them. He then briefly explained the main processes of afforestation work, such as planning and design, seed collection and seedling raising, pre-land preparation, mastering planting technology, and nurturing and protecting young forests.

Luo Yuchuan finally said that in China, such a great country that is vigorously carrying out socialist construction and transformation, implementing the greening of all barren mountains and wastelands is to transform China's natural appearance in accordance with the principles of socialist economic construction, so that China's forestry construction can meet the requirements of industry and agriculture, and completely transform the existing bare mountains and ridges into beautiful rivers and mountains. This is one aspect of China's entire socialist construction, a glorious, great, and very arduous task unprecedented in history. To complete such a task and make it more, faster, better, and more economical, it is necessary to rely on the mass strength of hundreds of millions of people, especially the strength of the hardworking and brave Chinese farmers who have embarked on the road of collectivization in more than 110 million households. To fully and comprehensively mobilize this great force, use it on the boundless and vast barren mountains and wastelands, and persist in it for a long time, so that it will not be proud and relaxed because of victory, and will not be depressed and shaken because of failure, it is necessary to unswervingly rely on the 120 million Chinese youths who are advancing bravely under the great banner of socialism to be the backbone and pioneers. He called on the youth to mobilize to learn technology, march to barren mountains and wastelands, and fight to the end for greening the motherland. (Xinhua News Agency)

    学会林业技术，向荒山荒地进军，为绿化祖国而奋斗（摘要）
    林业部副部长  罗玉川
    林业部副部长罗玉川在五省（区）造林大会上的报告：“学会林业技术，向荒地荒山进军，为绿化祖国而奋斗”摘要如下：
    罗玉川在报告中首先谈到了我国现有森林情况和12年绿化的初步规划问题。他说，作为国家建设和人民生活生产所必需的重要资源之一的我国现有森林，这个在历史上本来很丰富的宝贵资源，因反动统治阶级的长期破坏，留下的太少了，现在全国只有森林114，000多万亩，仅占整个国土面积7.9％，以全国人口平均计算每人不到二亩，而荒山荒地有45亿亩以上，其中约有一半需要绿化。我国现有的森林，主要分布在东北的吉林、黑龙江两省和内蒙古东部，其次是散布在江南10几省的山区。由于森林分布不均，华北、西北和其他很多地区缺少森林，到处是童山秃岭，水土流失严重，气候失调，就造成了水、旱、风、沙、雹等自然灾害，严重地危害着农业生产。
    由于森林太少，而且分布不均，在供应木材支援社会主义工业化方面也有一定的困难，全国现有木材蓄量约49亿立方公尺。平均每人仅8立方公尺左右。而苏联在最近几年每年木材采伐量，按全国人口平均每人接近2立方公尺。大家知道，木材在工业建设上是仅次于钢铁的重要资料。我国随着经济建设的发展，木材需要量必然大量增加，如12年后，国家计划每年采煤3亿吨，即需矿柱材840多万立方公尺（约需6尺长的矿柱7亿多根）；又如木材是主要的造纸原料，苏联造纸98％采用木材，我国由于木材缺乏，不能大量用木材造纸，现在只有30％左右用木材，而且造纸工业远不能赶上需要，将来全国6亿人口，人人都要读书看报，都要写字，这就需要很多很多的纸张，如每年需300万吨，以80％用木材做原料，即需要1，000万立方公尺以上，相当于1952年国家总采伐量。除此以外，很多重要工业原料，如橡胶、人造丝、油脂和酒精等，和人民生活中所需各项用材，都要由我国现有森林供应。这就显示了我国现有森林十分不足的严重情况。其次，现在国家工业建设和国防建设用材，大部分由东北、内蒙古供应，远的要运行5，000里，一般也在3，000里以上。木材远运，就增加了木材成本，也就提高了有关工业品的价格和各项建设的造价。
    那么怎样办呢？这就必须认真贯彻中共中央关于12年内绿化一切荒山荒地的规定，必须加速我国绿化建设。林业部和各省林业部门最近按照国民经济发展的要求结合各个地区经济条件和自然条件，共同拟定了一个绿化建设的初步规划草案，预计在12年内把全国可能绿化的荒山荒地共约157，000余万亩，主要依靠群众有计划地营造起森林来（包括封山育林后可成林的约28，000余万亩）。其中用材林约有10亿亩。规划中也包括营造各种防护林和大量发展桑、柞、油料、果木、茶等经济树木。并要求全国一切铁路、公路、大路、河流两旁及城市、村庄周围都要根据需要与可能尽快地完成各项绿化工作。
    这个规划实现以后，除西藏、新疆、青海等地外，其余各省森林复被率多数可达到30％左右，有的在20％左右，少数为10％左右，这些森林就可以起到调节气候，保持水土和稳定农田丰收的作用，并且为国家增加木材蓄积量约90亿立方公尺，基本上可以满足若干年后国家和人民用材的需要。将要营造的油茶林6，000余万亩，成林后加上现有1，900余万亩，每年可产油21亿多斤，可解决18，000余万人口的食油问题。
    规划中对各个地区的绿化任务也作了适当规定：
    黑龙江、吉林和内蒙古东部现有森林较多，除应加强对现有森林的保护和经营管理外，要积极进行新旧采伐迹地的更新工作，要有计划地继续营造防护林和荒山造林。
    河北、河南、山东、山西、辽宁、陕西和甘肃东部等地区、荒山荒地很多、水土流失严重，水、旱、风、沙等灾害严重。应以营造水土保持林、固沙林和护田林为主，并选择适宜的较大山区，划定较大面积营造用材林，争取将来地方用材自给。
    新疆、青海和内蒙古西部、甘肃西部雨量稀少，风沙严重，有大面积的可垦荒地，除应保护好现有森林以调节水源外，还要适应整个经济建设的发展，积极营造防沙林和护田林及绿化一切可能绿化的荒山荒地，以逐步扩大水源林，保证农业丰收，将来工业上亦可就地取材。
    江南各省雨量多，气候温暖，林木生长快，除对原有森林加强保护和经营管理外，应充分利用这里的优越条件，大力营造用材林和有计划地发展各种特用经济林，结合保持水土，建立国家用材基地，并按国家将来的需要供应各项林产品。
    此外，养蚕植桑，水果、山果、山药等，各地都应注意发展，在规划中要统一安排。
    全国的绿化建设规划实现以后，就可以改变我国大自然的面貌，童山秃岭将变为锦绣河山。
    罗玉川接着谈到了黄河中游地区的林种树种问题。
    他首先谈到了我国已制定的一个根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的伟大计划。他说，实施这个计划的关键问题，是对黄河泥沙的控制。只有在黄土区域做好水土保持工作，把黄土和雨水留在农田上，才能消除黄河流域的灾害，改变黄河流域的自然条件。怎样避免雨水沿地面流走，方法很多，最经济、最有效的办法是造水土保持林。因为森林是最好的保水工具。只要有树林的地方我们都可以看到森林保持水土的作用。因此，在黄河中游，特别是黄土高原地区，就要按照水土保持与经济利益开展大规模的造林工作。首先要根据地形和水土流失的情况，大体上按以下几个类型进行规划：
    （1）丘陵沟壑区：这类地区丘陵重叠，沟壑纵横，坡陡，流急，水土流失严重。而控制水土流失的主要问题，是对于沟壑的改造和利用。要达到治沟的目的，就必须护坡、固沟、保梁峁。这几部分工作做好了，就能从根本上控制水土流失。因此，在这个地区应该按具体情况分别造以下几种防护林：护坡林、沟底防冲林、沟头防护林、水流调节林带、梁峁造林、护岸林和滩地造林。
    丘陵沟壑区水土流失最为严重，面积最大，每平方公里每年泥沙冲刷量为5，000到1万公吨（其中部分地区因年降雨量在300公厘以下，每年泥沙冲刷量为1，000至2，000公吨）。在这个地区，根据不同的泥沙冲刷量，要求陕北、晋西（水土流失最严重）。营造水土保持林后，森林复被率（即造林后林地面积占土地总面积的百分比）应达40％左右；延水、泾河、北洛河、无定河上游及甘肃东北部山水河、祖厉河流域水土流失次于前区，营造水土保持林后，森林复被率应为30％左右；渭河、汾河流域，晋南、豫西及伊河、南洛河流域，水土流失又次于前区，森林复被率应为8％。
    （2）高原沟壑区：这类地区水土流失剧烈，原面逐渐破碎，沟壑面积逐渐扩大，如甘肃陇东董志原沟壑密度每平方公里已达2公里，沟壑面积已占土地总面积的50％以上。因此水土流失的主要问题，也是沟壑治理问题。在这个区域里，除了没有梁峁地和丘陵地以外，其余均与丘陵沟壑区相同。但是为了防止旱灾，有的地方需要在原面上造农田防护林。
    高原沟壑区水土流失次于丘陵沟壑区，面积较小，每平方公里每年冲刷泥沙量为4，000至9，000吨。这个地区包括壑河、北洛河中下游的黄土高原沟壑区，造林后森林复被率应为28％左右。
    （3）土石山区：这类地区石多土薄，耕地少，经常山洪暴发。在这个地区主要是在有条件造林的山岭、陡坡、荒沟上造林；不能造林的地方，应先封山，培养造林条件。
    土石山区包括黄河中游的山区，面积仅次于丘陵沟壑区，每平方公里每年冲刷泥沙量为1，000至5，000吨（其中包括水土流失轻微的部分残林区）。这个地区应多造林。造林后，森林复被率可在40％以上。
    （4）风沙区：气候干旱，树木稀少，流沙移动迅速，经常埋没农田、村庄，堵塞道路和河流。主要是造防风固沙林，农田防护林和护岸林等。
    风沙区包括黄河流域北部伊克昭盟边缘一带的风沙区在内，面积较小（指黄河流域以内的风沙区），每年流入黄河的泥沙虽不多，但是流沙危害严重。拟定森林复被率为40％左右。
    （5）在黄河干、支流将要陆续修建水库，特别是三门峡大水库，已决定提前施工，提前建成。为了保护水库，必须大大加快营造水库保护林，有关省县应视做重点工程抓紧完成。
    其次，要选择适宜的树种：在黄土高原地区进行绿化建设，必需是按照水土保持要求，结合当地群众需要的方针来进行。这个地区普遍缺乏燃料、肥料和饲料，特别是燃料的缺乏，已成了黄河中游地区群众生活中一大困难。因此，造林时一定要结合水土保持造薪炭林，或选择洋槐、臭椿、杨、柳等速生树种以解决燃料问题。此外，为了供应西北地区将来建设用材和群众所需木料，亦可选用松、栎、水桐（小叶杨）等用材林树种。
    黄河中游地区的气候温和而干燥，土壤深厚而疏松，适宜于发展果树和桑树。果品和蚕丝是农民的重要副业，同时果品和丝绸是我国的一项重要出口物资。由此可见，在黄河流域造林工作中，结合水土保持林的营造，选择一定比例的果树和桑树，是很必要的。
    营造水土保持林一般应当采取乔灌木混交。因为这样一方面可以使幼的树冠迅速接连（郁闭）起来，促使幼林的生长，另一方面还可以使幼林很快的起到蓄水保土作用。总之树种的选择要根据当地自然条件，按照国家的长远利益与群众当前利益相结合的原则，从解决群众当前迫切需要出发，去结合长远利益。因此，首先应该选择生长快、收益早、蓄水保土作用大的乔木（包括配置一定比例的果树和桑树等）和有益的灌木。黄河中游地区的主要乔木有洋槐、榆树、桑、杏、胡桃、橡、栎杨、柳、松、柏等，灌木有柽柳、柠条、酸刺、胡枝子、紫穗槐、狼牙根、沙柳（适宜风沙区等）等。
    关于做好绿化规划及保证质量问题罗玉川指出，各省、县、乡可参考以上类型区的划分，林种、树种的规划和造林后要达到的森林复被率的初步指标，根据当地情况，结合农业、畜牧业和水利等措施，进行全流域（包括黄河干支流和较大的沟壑）的、全省的、全县的、全乡的生产规划，在生产规划中作好绿化划规。进行规划时，不仅应有总的完成年限，还要有分年实施的年度要求，一般的说，自然条件较好，人口较多地区，进度可以快些，条件较差的地区，就应在开始的一、二年内注意积累经验，推广经验，做好各项准备。
    谈到关于保证质量问题时，罗玉川说，大规模开展造林运动，必须注意造林质量问题，提高造林质量，就是要保栽、保活、保长大、保成林，要纠正以往造林成活率低，幼林生长不良的现象。所谓造林，并不仅是指“播种、栽苗、插条”而言，它包括规划设计，采种，育苗，整地，栽植，抚育保护几个主要工序，并一直到林木郁闭为止。林业部最近制定了造林、育苗两个技术规程，大家可以学习学习它。他接着把造林工作几个主要工序如规划设计、采种育苗、预先整地、掌握栽植技术、幼林抚育保护等作了扼要的说明。
    罗玉川最后说，在中国这样一个伟大的正在蓬蓬勃勃地进行着社会主义建设和改造的国度里，实行绿化一切荒山荒地，就是要按照社会主义经济建设的原则，改造我国自然面貌，使我国林业建设，能够适应工农业的要求，使现有的光山秃岭完全变成富丽的锦绣河山，这是我国整个社会主义建设的一个方面，是一项史无前例的光荣伟大而又非常艰巨的工作。完成这样一项工作，并把它做得又多又快又好又省，就必需依靠亿万人民的群众力量，特别是11，000多万户已经走上合作化道路了的勤劳勇敢的中国农民的力量。要把这一伟大力量，充分地全面地发动起来，在漫无边际的广阔的荒山荒地上使用起来，并长期坚持下去，使它不为胜利而骄傲松懈，不为失败而颓丧动摇，就必须坚定不移地依靠高举社会主义大旗，英勇前进的12，000万中国青年们做骨干做开路先锋。他号召青年们动员起来学好技术，向荒山荒地进军，为绿化祖国而奋斗到底。              （新华社）
