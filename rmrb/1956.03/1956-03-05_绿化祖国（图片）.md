Greening the Motherland
    Zhangwu County, Liaoning Province, used to be a region severely affected by sandstorms. Thanks to the government's leadership and the organization of the masses to plant forest belts and networks throughout the county, the sand dunes have gradually become fixed, and sandstorms have decreased year by year. The small pine trees on the sand dunes have grown sturdily, and in the future, this place will be fertile farmland and dense forests.

    辽宁省彰武县，原来是风砂灾害十分严重的地区。由于政府领导与组织群众在全县造了林带和林网，砂丘渐渐固定下来，风砂也逐年减少。砂丘上的小松树已经茁壮地长起来了，将来这里就是肥沃的农田和茂密的树林。
