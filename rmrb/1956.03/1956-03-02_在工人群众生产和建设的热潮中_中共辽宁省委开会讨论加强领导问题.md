Amidst the Production and Construction Upsurge of the Working Class, the CCP Liaoning Provincial Committee Holds a Meeting to Discuss Strengthening Leadership

    The CCP Liaoning Provincial Committee convened its Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) from February 20th to 26th, focusing on the issue of leadership in the new upsurge of the working class's enthusiasm for participating in socialist industrial construction.

    Driven by the high tide of the agricultural and handicraft cooperative movement and the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce, the industrial production, capital construction, and transportation sectors of Liaoning Province have witnessed an unprecedented new upsurge in the working class's enthusiasm for participating in socialist industrial construction since early December of last year. This followed the CCP Liaoning Provincial Committee's thorough communication to cadres and enterprise workers throughout the province of the instructions from the CCP Central Committee and Chairman Mao on opposing right-leaning conservative thinking and striving for socialist construction with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

    The meeting believes that the most fundamental characteristics of this new upsurge are: First, the socialist consciousness and enthusiasm of the workers have risen to an unprecedented level. This is manifested in the broad mass character of the new upsurge from its very beginning, with the movement developing unusually rapidly and vigorously. Workers and technicians in various regions of the province (such as Fushun, Shenyang, Benxi, Fuxin, etc.) and various enterprise sectors (such as coal mining, smelting, machinery, power, transportation systems, etc.) have been involved in the movement to varying degrees. The labor attitude of the workers has changed significantly. On the first day after the Spring Festival holiday, workers arrived at factories and mines on time, with attendance rates reaching over 96% in many factories and mines, and 100% in 8 units in Yingkou. The political enthusiasm of the workers has also greatly increased, with many people applying to join the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League. Second, it is rich in profound revolutionary character. From the very beginning, the movement was aimed at right-leaning conservative thinking, carrying out sharp struggles against all conservative and backward things, widely exposing the right-leaning conservative thinking of some leading bodies from the bottom up, revealing many unreasonable phenomena in the old rules and regulations of enterprise management, and actively tapping the potential of enterprises, repeatedly breaking through the plans formulated by the leadership. Third, creation, invention, promotion of advanced experiences, and rationalization proposals have become mass activities, with thousands of advanced experiences and rationalization proposals emerging. The vast majority of rationalization proposals are focused on solving the key problems of current production, and are based on learning from and promoting advanced Soviet experiences to improve technology, tools, and operating methods. Because major advanced experiences have continuously emerged in various regions and departments, accelerating the progress of completing the first Five-Year Plan, according to statistics from 84 state-owned factories and mines as of February 8th: 13 units will complete the Five-Year Plan more than one and a half years ahead of schedule, 59 units will complete it one to one and a half years ahead of schedule, and 12 units will complete it half a year to one year ahead of schedule. Currently, many enterprise units have also seen a new upsurge in workers' enthusiasm for learning culture and technology.

    The meeting pointed out: The current situation of the new upsurge of the working class's enthusiasm for participating in socialist industrial construction is healthy and progressing rapidly, and the leadership has greatly improved compared with the past. However, the development of the movement is not yet full enough and is very incomplete, and the masses are not fully mobilized. Geographically, the development is uneven. In enterprises, production and transportation industries are developing better, while capital construction systems are developing poorly; production departments are better, while auxiliary departments are worse. The main reason for the above situation is that the leadership lags behind the masses.

    This meeting called on the entire party in Liaoning Province to mobilize and concentrate the greatest strength to push forward the new upsurge of the working class's enthusiasm for participating in socialist industrial construction. The meeting believes that it is necessary to widely mobilize and organize workers, and comprehensively launch the advanced producer movement. In order to make the advanced producer movement develop more healthily and fully, it is first necessary to deeply carry out the struggle against right-leaning conservative thinking. Second, it is necessary to actively support and promote advanced experiences, adopt rationalization proposals, and organize socialist competitions; it is necessary to actively lead and improve workers' cultural and technical learning to improve workers' cultural and technical level; it is necessary to correctly implement the principle of material rewards, and effectively improve work such as wages, rewards, labor protection, and welfare; it is necessary to concentrate the greatest strength to lead the current upsurge of workers' enthusiasm for construction, based on the principle of neither delaying suppression of counter-revolutionaries nor delaying production.

### 在工人群众生产和建设的热潮中  中共辽宁省委开会讨论加强领导问题

    在工人群众生产和建设的热潮中
    中共辽宁省委开会讨论加强领导问题
    中共辽宁省委员会在2月20日到26日召开省委员会第六次全体会议（扩大），集中讨论了工人群众参加社会主义工业建设热情的新高涨的领导问题。
    辽宁省工业生产、基本建设和交通运输部门，在农业的、手工业的合作化运动和私营工商业的社会主义改造的高潮的推动下，自去年12月初由中共辽宁省委向全省干部和企业职工深入传达中共中央和毛主席关于反对右倾保守思想，争取又多、又快、又好、又省地进行社会主义建设的指示以后，就开始出现前所未有的工人群众参加社会主义工业建设热情的新高涨。
    会议认为，这次新高涨最根本的特点：第一是职工群众的社会主义自觉性和积极性空前高涨。表现在新的高涨的局面一开始出现就带有广泛的群众性，运动发展得异常迅速、壮阔。全省各个地区（如抚顺、沈阳、本溪、阜新等地），各个企业部门（如煤矿、冶炼、机械、电业、交通运输等系统）的工人、技职人员都程度不同地卷入了运动。职工的劳动态度有了显著转变，春节放假以后的第一天，职工们都准时来到厂矿，许多厂矿出勤率达到96％以上，营口有8个单位出勤率达到100％。职工的政治积极性也大为提高，许多人要求加入共产党和青年团。第二是富有深刻的革命性。运动一开始就对准了右倾保守思想，向一切保守落后的东西进行尖锐的斗争，自下而上地广泛地揭露了某些领导方面的右倾保守思想，揭露出企业管理方面旧的规程制度的许多不合理的现象，积极地挖掘企业潜力，一再突破领导方面所制定的规划。第三是创造发明、推广先进经验和提出合理化建议已经成为群众性的活动，出现了成千上万的先进经验和合理化建议。绝大多数合理化建议都是集中在解决当前生产的关键问题上，都是在学习和推广苏联先进经验的基础上改进技术、改进工具、改善操作方法。正因为各地各部门不断出现重大的先进经验，加速了完成第一个五年计划的进程，仅据到2月8日止84个国营厂矿的统计：其中将提前一年半以上完成五年计划的有13个单位，将提前一年到一年半的有59个单位，将提前半年到一年的有12个单位。现在，不少企业单位还出现了职工学习文化、技术的热情的新高涨。
    会议指出：目前工人群众参加社会主义工业建设热情的新高涨的情况是健康的，进展迅速，领导方面比过去有很大改进。但是运动的展开还不够饱满，很不全面，群众发动还不充分。在地区上，开展得不平衡。在企业中，生产和交通运输业开展较好，基本建设系统开展较差；生产部门较好，辅助部门较差。形成上述情况的主要原因，是领导落后于群众。
    这次会议号召辽宁省全党动员起来，集中最大力量把工人群众参加社会主义工业建设热情的新高涨的局面推向前进。会议认为，必须广泛动员组织职工群众，全面展开先进生产者运动。为使先进生产者运动更健康饱满地开展，首先要深入开展反对右倾保守思想的斗争。其次，要积极支持和推广先进经验，采纳合理化建议，组织社会主义竞赛；要积极领导和改进职工文化技术学习，以提高职工文化技术水平；必须正确贯彻执行物质奖励的原则，切实改善工资、奖励、劳动保护、生活福利等工作；要根据肃反和生产两不误的方针，集中最大力量领导当前工人群众建设热情的新高涨。（据新华社讯）
