            A Sensational Controversy

U.S. Secretary of State Dulles has recently made several consecutive statements regarding the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. A common feature of all these statements is that Soviet foreign policy seems to have undergone a fundamental change due to the "position of strength" policy pursued by the United States. He believes that under U.S. pressure, the Soviet Union has "retreated," which is a manifestation of Soviet "weakness." As a United Press reporter put it, Dulles was trying to "paint an optimistic picture" for his discredited "position of strength" policy.

Dulles's evaluation of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has, as "New York Times" reporter Reston pointed out in his commentary, become a "sensational controversy," causing a great deal of "ridicule and criticism" from American political figures, especially Democrats. As for Dulles himself, according to American newspapers, he doesn't even "believe himself" in what he publicly says. On the contrary, Dulles has "frankly expressed unease" to State Department officials regarding the significant achievements of the Soviet Union's consistent pursuit of a peaceful foreign policy.

Why did Dulles make such a sweeping statement? A proper explanation can be found in the comments of American domestic and foreign political figures and newspapers.

          Fear in the Face of Truth

Former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Kennan, frankly expressed his disagreement with Dulles's statement that the Soviet Union continues to adopt a policy of easing international tensions due to "Soviet failure and weakness." The "New York Times" published an article on February 26th titled "Dulles and Kennan on Soviet Policy," stating that "no one here really believes that." The current U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Bohlen, described by American newspapers as an "on-the-spot observer," and Soviet experts in the United States unanimously believe that confidence in the future is the "true mark of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union just held in Moscow." Kennan also said, "I didn't see the world Dulles was talking about." One cannot but agree with this view. The process and resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union were filled with not only pride in past achievements but also an extremely firm confidence in the greater victories that are bound to come. Dulles could not fail to see the tremendous victories the Soviet Union has achieved on the economic front and in maintaining peace. The great strength and confidence arising from the superiority of socialism clearly frightened Dulles to the point of losing his mind. Therefore, he recklessly distorted the facts, treating the American people and clear-headed Americans as "children who would happily clap their hands at any fairy tale," as Democratic Senator Fulbright said, insisting that the Soviet Union was frightened by his "position of strength" policy.

          Not a Pretty Picture

As the Alsop brothers said in an article published in the "Washington Post" on February 22nd, "It is not difficult to understand why the Soviets 'just displayed confidence openly in Moscow.' It is more difficult to understand why Washington still openly expresses that complacent attitude." That is indeed the case. In the words of the same two authors in an article published in the "New York Herald Tribune" on February 29th, because Washington is facing "not a pretty picture."

Contrary to what Dulles boasted, the facts in recent years have shown not the success of the "position of strength" policy, but its increasing failure. An article in the British "Daily Mirror" on February 28th provided some "sobering facts." Military power: "The Soviet Union has cancelled the only military advantage that the West has enjoyed since 1945 by breaking the Western monopoly on nuclear weapons." International cooperation: "Khrushchev and Bulganin's trip to India and Burma was a very successful effort to gain the support of these 'non-aligned countries.'" "So far, the only response to this challenge is the 'Washington Declaration' concocted by Eisenhower and Eden at their meeting three weeks ago," "This series of pathetic and ridiculous clichés has only aroused ridicule throughout Asia."

It's not just that. Look at the scene of "unity, firmness, and determination of the free world" under the banner of the "position of strength" policy repeatedly touted by Dulles. The British "Daily Mail" on March 5th described the main components of this "free world" this way: "The Western front is collapsing. Wherever you look—it's collapsing." "First look at France. French Foreign Minister Pineau's startling speech is 'very inconsistent' with Western policy—the 'position of strength' policy of the Dulles ilk." Italian President Gronchi's recent speech in the U.S. Congress also reflected, to some extent, a condemnation of the "position of strength" policy. As for Britain, Associated Press reporter Hightower said in a dispatch on March 5th that Washington diplomatic experts believe that if the British government "had to take a stand, it would probably be more inclined to support Pineau's views than Dulles's. British public opinion often strongly opposes Dulles's advocacy of 'brinkmanship' and 'massive retaliation.'"

After analyzing the difficulties encountered by the United States, Britain, and France in the Middle East, South Asia, and Europe, this dispatch stated, "All these factors make it more difficult for the three governments to formulate, discuss, and agree on some fundamentally different, bold, and major new policies" to resist the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy. It said: "Many seasoned diplomats here are worried about their sense of unease about the volatility of Western policy and the uncertainty of the United States in dealing with this situation."

In the Middle East, the Baghdad Pact has met with increasing opposition. The recent dismissal of British officer Glubb as the Chief of General Staff of the Jordanian Army and Commander of the "Arab Legion" by Jordanian King Hussein is a significant manifestation of the determination of Middle Eastern countries to pursue independent policies. An article in the "New York Herald Tribune" on March 3rd regarding this incident illustrated Washington's unease. It said, "Generally speaking, Jordan's action also shows that the forces in the Middle East against the Baghdad Pact are constantly growing." "If weak and helpless Jordan can pull this off, then how will the rest of the Arab countries view this matter?"

An important tool for the United States to pursue its "position of strength" policy in Asia is the Manila Pact. Although the planners of the Manila Pact have held a series of meetings over the past year and recently conducted a so-called "solid link" military exercise in an attempt to intimidate and suppress the Asian people, the "position of strength" policy, built on the foundation of piecing together military blocs, has been continuously defeated due to the increasing popularity of the policy of peaceful coexistence in Asia. The planners of the Manila Pact cannot but find themselves increasingly isolated and passive. An article in the British "Economist" on March 3rd said: "The Cambodian Prime Minister, who has just traveled to China, said that his country rejects the protection of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization because such protection will 'dishonor us.'" "Even in Pakistan and the loyal Philippines, voices can be heard calling for the establishment of closer relations with communist countries."

As for West Germany and Japan, these are two important bases for the United States to pursue its "position of strength" policy. But now the situation is becoming increasingly unfavorable to the United States. American commentator Brown recently published an article in the Washington "Star," pointing out that the recent overthrow of the Christian Democratic Union Arnold government in North Rhine-Westphalia, West Germany, and the significant increase in votes for the Greek opposition party in the parliamentary elections have made the trend of the United States "possibly being isolated" "dramatic." Brown said that the overthrow of the Arnold government was a "representation of West Germans favoring neutrality." This matter will further delay the legal proceedings regarding the "establishment of a 500,000-man army" in West Germany. As for Japan, there are increasing demands from Japanese people for the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and between Japan and the Soviet Union. Just before Dulles's upcoming visit to Japan, the influential "Mainichi Shimbun" issued such a warning to Dulles: "If you want to peddle anything, peddling peace is much better than peddling war." Another influential newspaper, the "Asahi Shimbun," echoed this view. The "Mainichi Shimbun" also revealed that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not expect any "development" in Japan-U.S. relations because of the upcoming visit of U.S. Secretary of State Dulles to Japan. The proposal of this view cannot be considered accidental.

            Embarrassment and Chaos

The above comments depict the main trends of the current situation. Never before has the "position of strength" policy been so despised by people of all countries. When millions of people believe that peaceful coexistence is possible and necessary, it is becoming increasingly difficult to publicly defend the "position of strength" policy. Precisely for this reason, as Democratic Senator Fulbright accused Dulles of saying, Dulles is trying to prove that "the Soviet Union's victory is actually a defeat, and the West's defeat is actually a victory." Dulles is attempting to salvage his "position of strength" policy by using this method of reversing well-known facts. However, judging from the reaction in the United States and Western countries, Dulles's efforts to save the "prestige" of the foreign policy he pursues have obviously not achieved their purpose. Moreover, these actions have instead triggered new attacks on Dulles himself and the "position of strength" policy he implements. As the British "Observer" said, "The attacks on Dulles at home show the growing unease of the American ruling group about the failure of foreign policy."

Now, the attacks on the "position of strength" policy in the United States have also reached an unprecedented level. Recently, there has been much discussion in the United States about this policy being "unrealistic," and many Americans have begun to realize that this policy is inevitably going to "fail" and is "futile." Even U.S. Secretary of Defense Wilson, a powerful figure who has always advocated the "position of strength" policy, recently had to say: "Military strength alone cannot solve world problems."

"Re-examining foreign policy" is already a common demand in the United States. According to foreign news agencies, within the U.S. State Department, there are also different views on the "position of strength" policy of piecing together military blocs. It is said that one view believes that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Baghdad Pact, and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization are not outdated, and it only needs to be "strengthened and repaired." Another view believes that the United States should increasingly use treaty organizations in the future as a means of providing "economic aid" to countries in need, that is, in the future, it should adopt more "economic aid" methods to achieve the goals of the "position of strength" policy. It is obvious that powerful groups in the United States are still clinging to the "position of strength" policy. However, the "position of strength" policy of piecing together military blocs has been abandoned by all peace-loving people in the world; and even in the United States, some people have expressed doubts about the United States' foreign "economic aid": In the past, the United States' "aid" to its allies proved that "dollars alone cannot win friends."

"Embarrassment and chaos" are the words that former Democratic presidential candidate Stevenson used to describe the current situation of Dulles and his ilk's "position of strength" policy.

    “狼狈和混乱”
    ——从西方舆论看美国外交政策——
    钦本立
            哄动一时的争论
    美国国务卿杜勒斯最近接连几次发表了关于苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的谈话。所有这些谈话内容的一个共同特点是：苏联的外交政策好像是由于美国所奉行的“实力地位”政策而有了根本的变化，他认为，在美国的压力下，苏联“退却”了，这是苏联“软弱”的表现。像合众社记者所说那样，杜勒斯竭力替自己的声名扫地的“实力地位”政策“描绘了一幅乐观的图景”。
    杜勒斯对苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的这种评价，“纽约时报”记者赖斯顿在评论时指出，已成了“哄动一时的争论”，引起了美国政界人物、首先是民主党人的一大堆“嘲笑和批评”。至于杜勒斯本人，据美国报刊透露，他对自己公开所说的一套，连“自己也不相信”，相反，对于苏联一贯奉行和平外交政策所取得的重大成就，杜勒斯在国务院官员面前却“坦白地表示了不安”。
    为什么杜勒斯又大放厥辞呢？从美国国内、外政界人士和报刊的评论中似乎可以找到应有的解释。
          在真理面前的恐惧
    前美国驻苏联大使凯南率直地表示了不同意杜勒斯的这种说法：苏联继续采取缓和国际紧张局势的政策，是由于“苏联的失败和软弱”。“纽约时报”2月26日登载的题为“杜勒斯和凯南谈苏联政策”的文章说，关于这一点，“这里没有一个人真的相信”。被美国报刊形容为“现场观察家”的美国现任驻苏联大使波伦和在美国的苏联问题专家一致认为，对于未来的自信心是“刚在莫斯科举行的苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的真正标志”。凯南还说，“杜勒斯所谈论的那个世界，我没有看到。”人们不能不同意这种看法。苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的进程和它的决议，洋溢着一种不仅是对过去的成就的自豪，而且也是对必然会到来的更加伟大的胜利的极其坚定的信心。杜勒斯也不能不看到苏联在经济战线上和在维护和平上所获得的巨大胜利。从社会主义的优越性产生的伟大力量和自信显然使杜勒斯恐惧到失去理智了。因此他就不顾一切地歪曲事实，把美国人民和美国的头脑清醒的人当做美国民主党参议员福尔布莱特所说的“对任何童话都会高兴拍手的小孩看待”，硬说苏联被他的“实力地位”政策吓倒了。
          不是一幅美妙的图景
    正像“华盛顿邮报”2月22日登载的艾尔索普兄弟的一篇文章所说，要了解苏联人“刚刚在莫斯科公开显示自信心的原因是不难的。要了解华盛顿仍然公开表示那种洋洋自得的态度则是比较困难的”。事实正是如此。用同是这两个作者在“纽约先驱论坛报”2月29日登载的文章中一句话说，因为在华盛顿面前“不是一幅美妙的图景”。
    和杜勒斯所吹嘘的正相反，近几年来的事实发展表明，不是“实力地位”政策的成功，而是它的日益失败。英国“每日镜报”2月28日的一篇文章提供了这样一些“令人清醒的事实”。军事力量：“苏联由于打破了西方对核子武器的垄断而取消了西方从1945年以来一直享有的唯一军事优势”。国际合作：“赫鲁晓夫和布尔加宁的印度和缅甸之行是取得这些‘没有加入集团的国家’的支持的一种非常成功的努力”。“迄今为止，对这种挑战的唯一回答就是艾森豪威尔和艾登在三星期前举行的会谈时所编造出来的‘华盛顿宣言’”，“这一连串可怜又可笑的滥调只不过引起了全亚洲的嘲笑”。
    事情还不仅这样。看看被杜勒斯再三宣扬的在“实力地位”政策标志下的“自由世界的团结、坚定和决心”的情景吧。英国“每日邮报”3月5日这样形容了这个“自由世界”的主要组成部分：“西方阵线正在崩溃。无论你往什么地方看——它都在崩溃”。“先看法国。法国外交部长比诺的令人吃惊的演说和西方政策——杜勒斯之流的‘实力地位’政策——是‘很不一致的’。”最近意大利总统格隆基在美国国会发表的演说，也在某种程度上反映了对“实力地位”政策的谴责。至于英国，美联社记者海托华3月5日的电讯说，华盛顿外交专门家认为，如果英国政府“不得不表明态度的话，那么同杜勒斯的意见比起来，它大约将比较倾向于支持比诺的意见。英国舆论界经常强烈反对杜勒斯‘战争边缘’和‘大规模报复’等主张。”
    这个电讯在分析了美英法三国在中东、在南亚、在欧洲所遭遇到的困难后说，“所有这些因素使得三国政府要制定、讨论和同意一些根本不同的、大胆的和重大的新政策”来抵制苏联的和平外交政策，是更为困难了。它说：“这里许多老练的外交官对他们所具有的对西方政策的动荡不定的感觉和对美国在应付这种局势方面的不确定的感觉感到忧虑”。
    在中东，巴格达条约遭到了日益强烈的反对。最近约旦国王侯赛尼解除了英国军官格拉布所担任的约旦陆军总参谋长和“阿拉伯军团”司令的职务，是中东国家决心奉行独立政策的显著表现。“纽约先驱论坛报”3月3日发表的关于这个事件的文章说明了华盛顿的不安。它说，“大概说来，约旦的这一行动也显示，中东反巴格达条约的势力正在不断增长”。“如果力量薄弱和没有办法的约旦能给我们来这一手，那么其余的阿拉伯国家将要怎么看这件事呢”。
    美国在亚洲推行“实力地位”政策的重要工具是马尼拉条约。尽管马尼拉条约的策划者在过去一年多来举行了一连串会议，并在最近作了一次企图恐吓和镇压亚洲人民的所谓“坚固环节”的军事演习，但由于和平共处的政策在亚洲日益深入人心，建立在拼凑军事集团基础上的“实力地位”政策已不断地遭到失败。马尼拉条约的策划者不能不日益陷于孤立和被动的地位。英国“经济学家”3月3日的一篇文章中说：“刚刚旅行中国回来的柬埔寨首相说，他的国家拒绝东南亚条约组织的保护，因为这种保护将‘使我们不光荣’”。“即使在巴基斯坦和忠实的菲律宾，也可以听到要求同共产党国家建立更加密切的关系的呼声”。
    至于西德和日本，这是美国推行“实力地位”政策的两个重要基地。但现在的情况也越来越不利于美国了。美国评论家布朗最近在华盛顿“明星报”发表文章指出，最近西德北莱因—威斯特伐利亚州基督教民主联盟阿诺德政府的被推翻和希腊反对党在议会选举中选票的大大增加，使得美国“可能被孤立起来”的趋势“戏剧化了”。布朗说，阿诺德政府的被推翻是西德人“赞成中立的表示”。这件事将使西德“建立50万人的军队一事在法律上进一步受到拖延”。至于在日本，有越来越多的日本人士提出了恢复日中、日苏邦交的迫切要求。正当杜勒斯即将访问日本的前夕，在日本有影响的“每日新闻”却向杜勒斯提出了这样的警告：“如果你要贩卖任何东西，贩卖和平要比贩卖战争好得多”。另一家有影响的“朝日新闻”附和了这种看法。“每日新闻”还透露，日本外务省并不指望日本—美国关系会因为美国国务卿杜勒斯即将访问日本而取得任何“发展”。这种看法的提出不能被认为是偶然的。
            狼狈和混乱
    上述这些评论，刻划出了当前局势的主要趋势。“实力地位”政策从来没有像今天这样遭到各国人民的鄙弃。当千千万万人都相信和平共处是可能和必要的时候，要公开为“实力地位”政策作辩解是越来越困难了。正因为这样，正像美国民主党议员福尔布莱特指责杜勒斯所说的，杜勒斯是企图证明“苏联的胜利实际上是失败，而西方的失败实际上是胜利”。杜勒斯就企图用这种颠倒众所周知的事实的方法来挽救他的“实力地位”政策。然而从美国国内和西方国家的反应来看，杜勒斯为了拯救他所奉行的外交政策的“威信”而做的努力显然是没有达到目的。而且，这些行动反而引起对杜勒斯本人和他所执行的“实力地位”政策的新的攻击。正像英国“观察家”所说，“杜勒斯在国内遭到的抨击表明了美国统治集团对外交政策的失败的日益增长的不安。”
    现在，在美国国内对“实力地位”政策的抨击也已达到空前未有的程度。最近以来，在美国就议论纷纷地在谈论着这种政策是“不现实的”，美国许多人已开始意识到这个政策是不可避免地要遭到“失败”，并且是“没有前途的”。就像美国国防部长威尔逊这样一个一向鼓吹“实力地位”政策的有力人物最近也不得不说：“单是军事力量不能解决世界问题”。
    “重新审查外交政策”已经是美国国内普遍的要求。据外国通讯社报道，在美国国务院内部，对拼凑军事集团的“实力地位”政策也存在着不同的看法。据说一种意见认为，北大西洋公约组织、巴格达条约和东南亚条约组织并不是过时的，它只需要“加强和修补”。另一种意见认为美国今后应越来越多地利用条约组织作为把“经济援助”供应给所需要的国家的手段，就是说今后应更多采用“经济援助”的方法来达到“实力地位”政策的目标。显而易见，美国有势力的集团仍然抱住“实力地位”政策不放。但拼凑军事集团的“实力地位”政策已遭到全世界爱好和平的人士的唾弃；而美国的对外“经济援助”，即使在美国国内也有人对这一点表示怀疑：过去美国对盟国的“援助”证明，“单是美元是不能够争取朋友的”。
    “狼狈和混乱”，这就是前民主党总统候选人史蒂文森用来形容杜勒斯之流的“实力地位”政策目前的处境的字眼。
