    The People's Daily published on March 14th and today letters of accusation from Chinese students and their relatives, which expose the U.S. government's persecution of Chinese students. Su Xianji, a student in the U.S., was wanted by the U.S. government simply for wanting to return to China, forcing him to "change his name" and "run around". Another student, Bao Zhe'en, was forced by the U.S. authorities to "recuperate" in a sanatorium under the pretext of "lung disease" because he expressed his desire to return to China. Not only were his freedom of movement and communication restricted, but his "life became a problem," and he eventually died in the United States in an unexplained manner. This behavior of the U.S. government, which tramples on the norms of international relations and violates humanitarianism, has aroused the indignation of righteous people around the world.

    Today, the cruel persecution of Chinese students in the United States for wanting to return to China is by no means an isolated incident. A large number of facts have proved that any Chinese in the United States today who expresses a desire to return to China will be subjected to various forms of persecution. Before the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks in Geneva, the U.S. government took open measures of obstruction and forced detention. After the ambassadorial talks in Geneva reached an agreement on the issue of the return of civilians from both sides, the U.S. authorities, while verbally claiming that Chinese students in the U.S. had the "freedom" to return to China, actually took various measures to obstruct their return. For example, setting unreasonable short departure deadlines, or deliberately making things difficult under the pretext of tax arrears, and even forcing students to apply for U.S. citizenship and obtain Taiwan entry permits, and so on. Recently, they have used methods such as "salary increases" and "degrees" to lure them, attempting to change the desire of our students to return to China. For a long time, many Chinese students who want to return to China have been subjected to persecution such as summonses, surveillance, wanted notices, and imprisonment, suffering greatly in spirit, and some have become mentally disturbed as a result. Some students have even been persecuted to death or have disappeared. Liu Yongming, Bao Zhe'en, and Su Xianji are just a few examples.

    Because the U.S. government deliberately obstructs our students from freely returning to China, relatives of students include elderly parents in their seventies or eighties with white hair who are ill from long-term missing their long-separated children, children of eight or nine years old who have not seen their parents for a long time and look forward to their return every day; there are married or unmarried couples who have been separated for ten years and still cannot reunite.... However, the U.S. State Department shamelessly talks about "humanitarianism" and "respect for international obligations that form the basis of a stable international order," and attempts to divert public attention and cover up the extremely unreasonable and brutal persecution of our students by using the excuse that a small number of Americans who committed crimes in China have not yet been released. However, as pointed out in countless letters of protest sent to this newspaper by readers, although American criminals who harmed the interests of the Chinese people have mostly been released early even though their sentences were not yet complete, many innocent Chinese students are still being persecuted and tortured by the U.S. government. The facts are there, and it is impossible for the U.S. government to cover up the eyes and ears of the world and deny its violation of international obligations and its destruction of personal freedom.

    Today, the families of Chinese students in the United States are earnestly requesting the U.S. government to hand over their relatives so that they can return home to reunite. If the U.S. government truly values "humanitarianism" and has even a shred of sincerity in abiding by the agreement, it must immediately stop all persecution and obstruction of Chinese students and allow them to return to their motherland safely and freely.

### 美国政府必须停止对中国留学生的野蛮迫害

    美国政府必须停止对中国留学生的野蛮迫害
    三月十四日和今日本报发表了中国留学生和他们的亲属寄来的一些控诉信，这些信揭露了美国政府对中国留学生的迫害行为。留美学生苏先绩仅仅因为要回国，就被美国政府通缉，以致不得不“改名换姓”，“东奔西走”；另一个留美学生鲍哲恩因为表示了要求回国的愿望，被美国当局以“肺病”为理由，迫赴疗养所“休养”，不仅行动和通讯的自由都被限制，连“生命亦成问题”，而且终于不明不白地死在美国。美国政府这种践踏国际关系准则、违反人道的行为，引起世界正义人士的公愤。
    今天在美国的中国留学生，由于要求回国而遭到残酷迫害的，决不只是个别的事件。大量的事实已经证明，今天在美国的中国人，只要表示了回国的愿望，形形式式的迫害，就会落到他们的身上。在日内瓦中美大使级会议前美国政府采取了公开阻挠和强制扣留的手段，而在日内瓦大使级会议达成关于双方平民回国问题的协议后，美国当局虽然口头上声称中国留美学生有回国的“自由”，但实际上采取了各种方式来阻挠中国留美学生的回国。例如规定不合理的短促的离境期限，或者借口欠税故意刁难，甚至迫使留美学生申请美国籍和领取台湾入境证等等。最近又以“增薪”和“学位”等办法进行利诱，企图这样来改变我国留学生的回国愿望。许久以来，不少要求回国的中国留学生受到传讯、监视、通缉、监禁等等的迫害，精神上备受痛苦，有的因此而神经失常。更有一些留学生被迫害致死，或者下落不明。刘永铭、鲍哲恩、苏先绩不过是一些例子而已。
    由于美国政府蓄意阻挠我国留学生自由回国，致使留学生家属中有年已七、八十岁白发苍苍的双亲因长期思念久别的儿女而忧郁成疾，八、九岁的儿童长时期没有见过父母而天天盼望自己父母的归来；有别离十载而仍然无法团聚的已婚或未婚的夫妻……。但美国国务院却恬不知耻，讲什么“人道”和“尊重构成稳定国际秩序的基础的国际义务”，并且以在中国犯法的美国人尚余一少部分未曾释放为借口，企图转移公众的注意，掩饰对我国留学生极端无理和野蛮的迫害行为。但正如无数读者寄给本报的抗议信中所指出，损害中国人民利益的美国罪犯虽然刑期未满，已大部分被提前释放，但是许多无罪的中国留学生却依旧遭到美国政府的迫害和折磨。事实具在，美国政府要想一手掩尽天下人耳目，抵赖自己违背国际义务，摧残人身自由的行为是不可能的。
    今天，中国留美学生家属纷纷恳切地要求美国政府交出他们的亲人，让他们能够回家团聚。如果美国政府真讲“人道”，真有一丝一毫遵守协议的诚意，就必须立即停止对中国留学生的各种迫害和阻挠，让他们平安和自由地回到祖国。
