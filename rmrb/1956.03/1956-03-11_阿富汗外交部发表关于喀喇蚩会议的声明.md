Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, 10th - Tass reports: The Afghan Foreign Ministry issued a statement regarding the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council meeting's discussion of the "Pashtunistan issue" (i.e., Pakhtunistan issue). The statement said: The Pashtunistan issue, which those who spoke at the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council meeting intended to portray as a dispute between Afghanistan and Pakistan, is in fact a question of the Pashtun people's struggle for their independence, a struggle against the illegal actions taken by Pakistan – illegal actions that undermine peace in this region of the world and complicate relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan.

The Afghan Foreign Ministry pointed out: Afghanistan urgently hopes to maintain peace in this region, and peace cannot be achieved unless the rights of the Pashtun people are fully guaranteed. The Pashtun people's indisputable and legitimate right to self-determination is stipulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and therefore all member states of the United Nations, including members of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, must consider this right.

The statement continued: Afghanistan supports the Pashtunistan people because of the long-standing close relationship between Afghans and Pashtuns, and also to maintain peace in the region. Afghanistan pursues a policy of supporting the just and legitimate aspirations of people all over the world.

The statement concluded: "We must declare once again: no conference, no political alliance, is qualified to decide the fate of a nation against its hopes and aspirations, nor is it qualified to discuss matters concerning them against the interests of that nation. From the beginning, in fact even before the establishment of the state of Pakistan, Afghanistan has strived for a peaceful resolution of the Pashtunistan issue, and is now willing to reaffirm this desire.

The statement said, however, that Afghanistan can only agree to discuss this issue at a conference where the opinions of both Pashtunistan and Pakistan can be heard equally. Any decision that does not guarantee the rights of the Pashtunistan people is meaningless to the Pashtunistan people. Afghanistan supports the legitimate aspirations of the Pashtunistan people and will not recognize such a decision, nor will it change its position because of such a decision."

    阿富汗外交部发表关于喀喇蚩会议的声明
    新华社10日讯　塔斯社喀布尔10日讯：阿富汗外交部就东南亚条约组织理事会会议讨论“普什图尼斯坦问题”（即巴克同尼斯坦问题）一事发表声明。声明说：在东南亚条约组织理事会会议上发言的人们打算说成是阿富汗和巴基斯坦之间争执中的问题的普什图尼斯坦问题，事实上是关于普什图人民争取自己的独立的斗争、关于反对巴基斯坦所采取的非法行动的斗争的问题——巴基斯坦的非法行动破坏了世界这一地区的和平，使得阿富汗和巴基斯坦之间的关系复杂化了。
    阿富汗外交部指出：阿富汗迫切希望保持这一地区的和平，而除非普什图尼斯坦人民的权利获得充分的保障，和平就不能实现。普什图人民的无可争辩的合法的自决权利，在人权宣言中有了规定，因此，联合国全体会员国，包括东南亚条约组织成员国在内，都必须考虑这种权利。
    声明接着说：阿富汗支持普什图尼斯坦人民，这是由于阿富汗人和普什图人之间的悠久的亲近关系，也是为了保持这一地区的和平。阿富汗执行支持全世界各国人民的正义的合法的愿望的政策。
    声明最后说：“我们必须再一次地声明：任何会议，任何政治同盟，都没有资格违背一个民族的希望和愿望决定他们的命运，也没有资格违背这个民族的利益讨论有关他们的问题。从一开始，事实上还在巴基斯坦国家成立以前，阿富汗就努力争取普什图尼斯坦问题的和平解决，现在愿意重申这种愿望。
    声明说，可是，阿富汗只能同意在一个可以平等地听取普什图尼斯坦和巴基斯坦的意见的会议上讨论这个问题。不能保证普什图尼斯坦人民的权利的任何决定，对于普什图尼斯坦人民都是毫无意义的。阿富汗支持普什图尼斯坦人民的正当愿望，将不承认这种决定，也不因为这种决定而改变自己的立场。”
