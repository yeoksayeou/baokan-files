Editor's note: In large cities, small vendors and handicraftsmen are scattered in streets and alleys, which has developed over time and naturally according to the needs of urban residents. This characteristic of convenience to residents should be well maintained when carrying out the socialist transformation of small urban vendors and handicraftsmen. If objective laws are violated, and the needs of residents are not considered, and they are simply merged and concentrated, it will cause inconvenience to citizens and reduce the turnover of small vendors and handicraftsmen. This practice violates the interests of the masses, and therefore is not in line with the policies of the Party and the state. The three examples published here vividly illustrate the errors of this practice. It is hoped that other places will learn from their lessons and pay attention to preventing this deviation.

　　Palm Brushes Hard to Find

　　Recently, it has been difficult to buy palm brushes in Dongchang District, Shanghai. What is the reason for this? It turns out that the six palm brush shops that were previously scattered in the commercial center, the relatively busy Dongchang Road, the muddy road and the residential areas, have been organized since January this year, and five outlets have been removed, concentrating them in Qichangzhan. In this way, whether the masses want to buy palm brushes or have them repaired, they have to go to Qichangzhan, no matter how far away.

　　The result of this is not only very inconvenient for the masses, but also unfavorable to the producers themselves. Last year, the average monthly turnover of these six palm brush shops was about 1,260 yuan. After the concentration this year, from February 1st to 20th, only three palm brushes were received for self-production and self-sale, and no repair business was received.

　　Waiting for Customers

　　After the handicraftsmen in the service industry in Wuhan were organized, many of them closed their original service points. After 45 members of the Sixth Washing and Dyeing Production Cooperative were organized, they concentrated in six places to wait for customers. In the past, almost every street in the city had shoe-stitching stalls, but now most of them have been removed; after 538 shoe-stitchers in Wuchang District were organized, more than 400 service points were reduced at once. The masses said: Now you have to take a bus to find a place to stitch shoes!

　　Fruit Stalls Reduced

　　In the process of socialist transformation of private industry and commerce in Hefei, more than 70 fruit merchants (most of whom were husband-and-wife shops and small vendors) were merged into 21 supply points. Originally, there were many fruit stalls near streets, alleys, and entertainment venues, but now they have been reduced and gathered in a few places, which is very inconvenient for the masses. Because of this, the turnover has also decreased. The fruit turnover of Hefei Native Produce Company in January this year decreased by 58.75% compared with December last year.

    不要盲目并店
    编者按：在大城市里的小商贩和小手工业者，分散地分布在街道和胡同里，这是根据城市居民的需要，长期地、自然地发展起来的。这种便利居民的特点，在对城市小商贩和小手工业者进行社会主义改造的时候，应该很好地保持下来。如果违反客观规律，不考虑居民的需要，简单化地把它们合并、集中起来，就会给市民造成不便，使小商贩和小手工业者的营业额下降。这种做法是违反群众利益的，因而也是不符合党和国家的政策的。这里发表的三个例子，生动地说明了这种做法的错误。希望其他地方接受他们的教训，注意防止这种偏向。
    买不到棕棚了
    最近在上海市东昌区很难买到棕棚。这是什么原因呢？原来是过去分散在商业集中、比较热闹的东昌路、烂泥路和居民住宅较多地区的6家棕棚店，从今年1月份组织起来以后，就撤掉了5个门市点，集中在其昌栈一个地方了。这样，群众买棕棚或棕棚坏了要修理，不管远近，都得到其昌栈去。
    这样作的结果，不但群众很不方便，而且对生产者自己也很不利。去年这6家棕棚店每月平均营业额约在1，260元左右，今年集中以后，从2月1日到20日，自产自销的业务仅接到了三只棕棚，修理业务一只也没有接到。
    等客上门
    武汉市服务性行业的手工业者组织起来以后，很多都撤销了原有的服务点。第六洗染生产合作社45个社员组织起来以后，集中在六个地方等客上门。过去全市几乎每条街道都有绱鞋摊子，现在大部分撤销了；武昌区538个绱布鞋的组织起来后，一下就减少了400多个服务点。群众说：现在要坐上公共汽车，才能找到绱鞋的地方！
    水果摊减少了
    合肥市在对私营工商业进行社会主义改造的时候，把70多户水果商（绝大部分是夫妻店和小摊贩）并成了21个供应点。原来街头巷尾和娱乐场所附近都有很多水果摊店，现在减少了，聚集在几个地方，群众感到很不方便。因为这个缘故，营业额也下降了。合肥市土产公司今年1月份的水果营业额就比去年12月份下降了58.75％。
