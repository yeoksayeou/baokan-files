    Approaching Technical Data with a Positive Attitude
    Wen Tianshen
    The small workshop of the Shenyang Fan Factory produces a type of centrifugal fan. According to the design, a certain part’s convex and concave areas should be riveted with two rivets. In May of last year, a worker named Jin Mingchen suggested changing the riveting to electric welding. This would shorten the operation time from more than twenty minutes to one minute. The work section supported him and conducted experiments, proving that this operation was entirely feasible. However, when Jin Mingchen went to the design department, the people there said, "This would change the design structure, we don't agree." When he went to the construction department, the people there said, "This would change the process specifications, we don't agree." Finally, when he found the engineer, the engineer gave an even more authoritative reason: "This design is based on Soviet data, it cannot be changed!"
    Why can't it be changed? Since the new method is better, the old, inferior method should give way. This is the natural law of production development and also the requirement of national interests.
    The Soviet experts gave them a vivid lesson on what attitude should be taken towards old, outdated things, and what attitude should be taken towards "Soviet data."
    After hitting many snags, the comrades in the small workshop were not discouraged. They took Jin Mingchen's suggestion to the Soviet experts for consultation. The Soviet experts studied the suggestion and believed it was correct, and enthusiastically added to it. He said: "Any suggestion that can improve production efficiency, ensure quality, and meet economic conditions should be adopted. The design structure can be changed, and the process specifications can also be changed. Products that were produced in the past that do not meet the new requirements should be eliminated and replaced with new products."
    The factory adopted the Soviet experts' opinions and implemented Jin Mingchen's suggestion, increasing the efficiency of this process by twenty times.
    This is not a very large reform. However, it has great educational significance. Because, even now, in other departments and enterprises, there are still some people who use all kinds of excuses to stubbornly defend everything that exists, saying that they are sacred and inviolable. They view all Soviet experiences with a stagnant eye. Regardless of whether this experience has had new developments in the Soviet Union, or whether Chinese workers have put forward new scientific improvements based on mastering it, they ignore them and remain stuck where they are.
    These people should be inspired by the Soviet experts: what is the correct socialist attitude towards technology.

    用积极态度对待技术资料
    文天申
    沈阳扇风机厂小型车间生产的一种离心扇风机，按照设计，有个部件的凸凹处应该铆两个铆钉。去年五月，工人金明臣提出了一个建议：把铆接改成电焊；这样，操作时间可以从二十多分钟缩短到一分钟。工段里支持他，进行了试验，证明这样操作是完全可行的。但是，金明臣找到设计科，设计科的人说：“这要改变设计结构，不同意。”找到施工科，施工科的人说：“这要改变工艺规程，不同意。”最后找到工程师，工程师提出了更有权威的理由：“这项设计是苏联资料，不能改！”
    为什么不能改呢？既然新的做法更好，旧的不好的做法就应该让位。这是生产发展的自然规律，也是国家利益的要求。
    应该用什么态度来对待旧的、过了时的东西，应该用什么态度来对待“苏联资料”，苏联专家给他们上了一堂活生生的课。
    小型车间的同志在碰了许多钉子之后，仍不灰心，他们把金明臣的建议拿去向苏联专家请教。苏联专家研究了这个建议，认为这个建议是正确的，并且热情地做了补充。他说：“任何一个建议，只要能够提高生产效率，保证质量，合乎经济条件，我们都应该采用。设计结构可以改变，工艺规程也可以改变。过去生产的不合新的要求的产品，就应该淘汰掉，用新产品来代替。”
    工厂采纳了苏联专家的意见，实行了金明臣的建议，使这道工序的效率提高了二十倍。
    这并不是一件很大的改革。但是，它有很大的教育意义。因为，现在在别的部门和企业里，也还有这样一些人，他们用各种各样的借口，顽固地保卫着现存的一切，说它们是神圣不可侵犯的。他们用停滞的眼光来看待一切苏联的经验，不管这个经验在苏联国内已经有了新发展，或是我国的职工在已经掌握了它的基础上提出了合乎科学的新改进，他们都置之不理，而死守在原地不动。
    这些人应该从苏联专家身上得到启发：什么是正确的对待技术的社会主义态度。
