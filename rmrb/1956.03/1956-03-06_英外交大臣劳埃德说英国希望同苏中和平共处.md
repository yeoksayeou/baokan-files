Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 5th. British Foreign Secretary Lloyd stated in a speech to the Indian Council of World Affairs on March 4th that Britain hopes to coexist peacefully with the Soviet Union and China.

Lloyd visited India before going to Karachi to attend the Manila Treaty Organization Council meeting.

Lloyd said, "We ourselves also want to live in peace. If we can transform the arms race into a competition of ideas and living standards, then we will have taken a big step towards a unified world." However, Lloyd added, "I don't think the time has come when we can ignore armaments."

Speaking of the differences between India and Britain, he said, "We agree on the view that we have a great responsibility in this difficult world to mediate, ease tensions, resolve differences, and seek solutions to maintain peace."

Lloyd mentioned Indian criticism of the Baghdad Pact. He defended the treaty and the aggressive aims of other military blocs. He said that Britain believes that such military blocs are "politically respectable."

Regarding the Indochina issue, Lloyd said that Britain is determined to abide by the 1954 Geneva Accords on Indochina. He said that if we all have the determination to maintain these agreements, the difficulties in implementing the Geneva Accords can be overcome.

When talking about the Taiwan and coastal islands issue, Lloyd repeated the American argument, attempting to confuse the dispute between China and the United States in the Taiwan area with China's internal affairs of exercising sovereignty over Taiwan and the coastal islands. He said, "The primary principle of Britain's policy on this issue is that no one should try to resolve this issue by force."

    英外交大臣劳埃德说英国希望同苏中和平共处
    新华社新德里5日电  英国外交大臣劳埃德3月4日在印度世界事务委员会发表了一篇演说说，英国希望同苏联和中国和平共处。
    劳埃德是在去喀喇蚩参加马尼拉条约组织理事会会议以前到印度访问的。
    劳埃德说，“我们自己也要求在和平中生活。如果我们能够把军备竞赛转变为思想上的和生活水平上的竞赛的话，那我们就将是向一个统一的世界迈进了一大步。”不过，劳埃德又说，“我并不认为现在已经到了我们可以忽视军备的时候了”。
    他在谈到印度和英国之间的分歧时说，“我们同意这种看法：我们在这个困难重重的世界上都负有重大的责任，应该出来进行调解，缓和紧张局势，解决各种分歧以及寻求各种解决办法来使得和平得以维持。”
    劳埃德提到印度人对巴格达条约的批评。他为这个条约和其他军事集团的侵略目的辩护。他说，英国认为这种军事集团“在政治上是值得尊重的。”
    关于印度支那问题，劳埃德说，英国决心遵守1954年关于印度支那的日内瓦协定。他说，如果我们大家都能有保持这些协定的决心，执行日内瓦协定的困难是可以克服的。
    劳埃德在谈到台湾和沿海岛屿问题时重复了美国的论调，企图把中美两国在台湾地区的争端同中国对台湾和沿海岛屿行使主权的内政问题混淆起来。他说，“英国在这个问题上的政策的首要原则就是任何人都不应该想用武力来解决这个问题。
