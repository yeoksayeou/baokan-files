Make the "Land of Abundance" More Prosperous
By Our Correspondent Ji Xichen

    In the hopeful spring, folk songs describing the vision of their hometowns are popular in the rural areas of Sichuan: "Red mountains turn green, mulberry trees fill the gardens, rice, wheat, grain, and cotton fill the barns, oranges and lemons are planted in front of the courtyards, chickens, ducks, pigs, and rabbits fill the pens, ponds are built to release water to irrigate the rice paddies." In the songs filled with great ideals, people also hope that tractors will enter their fields, that cars will speed along the roads of the countryside, that the rushing rivers will generate infinite electricity, leading to distant places...
    Sichuan Province, the largest grain-producing province in the country, has had consecutive bumper harvests for six years since liberation, and the level of grain production has continued to increase. Even before the start of the first Five-Year Plan, in 1952, the province's total grain output reached 32.3 billion jin, exceeding the highest annual output in history. In 1953, the total grain output rose to 35.1 billion jin, in 1954 it increased to 37.5 billion jin, and in 1955 it reached more than 40 billion jin. Sichuan Province can transport large quantities of grain to various places every year to support national construction. During the discussion of the draft national agricultural development program, the people of Sichuan were determined to raise grain production to a higher level: striving to increase the yield per mu from the current 404 jin to 800 jin within 7 years; and to increase the province's total grain output from 44.5 billion jin in 1956 to 80 billion jin in 1962. This is not only almost double the 27 billion jin in 1947 before liberation, but also one and a half times the historical peak of 32 billion jin in 1938; this makes it possible for the people of the province to reserve enough surplus grain for two years of consumption within 12 years in all areas mainly producing rice and wheat, in addition to their own consumption and ensuring the grain needed by the state.
    It is entirely possible to achieve this production increase plan. Sichuan Province has great potential in agricultural production. Here, the climate is mild, the rainfall is abundant, and the soil is fertile. All kinds of crops from the south and the north are available. People affectionately call it the "Land of Abundance." In the mountainous areas surrounding the basin and the hills along the 2,000-li Yangtze River, in addition to rice and wheat, there are also abundant corn, cotton, and sweet potatoes. In the terraced fields surrounding the hillsides, the grain yield per mu in many places has already reached more than 700 jin. On the rich and beautiful western Sichuan Plain, there are nationally famous rice, rapeseed, tobacco, and hemp; on the evergreen land, three or four crops can be harvested in a year. Last year, the Chengdu Xichong Agricultural Cooperative achieved an average yield of more than 1,150 jin per mu on a large area of land.
    In addition to the superior natural conditions, the development of agricultural cooperativization plays a more decisive role in ensuring increased production. By the end of January, the number of farmers joining agricultural cooperatives had reached 77% of the province's total number of farmers. In the autumn of 1956, the number of farmers joining cooperatives will reach 90%. In 1958, the province can achieve complete socialist agricultural cooperativization. This brings unlimited hope and strength for a large increase in agricultural production.
    In order to strive to overfulfill this year's agricultural production increase task, a high tide of production is boiling everywhere, whether in mountainous areas, hills, or plains. Many agricultural cooperatives in Yibin, Luxian, Wenjiang, Xinfan and other places are enthusiastically carrying out production increase competitions of one thousand jin per mu. Under the slogan of "100 jin of cotton, 1,000 jin of grain, and 10,000 jin of sugarcane," Neijiang, Jianyang and other places in the Tuojiang River basin are generally carrying out land processing to turn low-yield land into high-yield fields. Farmers in the Suining area are using the great momentum of moving mountains and overturning seas to open up high mountain slopes into terraced fields, and newly build more than 3,000 ponds, so that more than 900,000 mu of cultivated land has been improved.
    In order to ensure agricultural production increases, in addition to the general promotion of improved varieties, the promotion of new agricultural tools, the planting of high-yield crops, efforts to develop fertilizer sources, improve the soil, and eliminate pests, the province will also vigorously improve the cultivation system, expand the multiple cropping area, so that more than 70% of the province's cultivated land will generally be planted with two or three seasons of crops, and the land utilization rate will be expanded from 148% in 1955 to 226%. This alone can increase grain production by 14 billion jin. In order to solve the fertilizer and water source problems after the expansion of the multiple cropping area, the province will develop the abundant phosphate mines and peat, promote mixed composting, and build a large number of ponds, dams, mountain bend ponds, and water storage fields. The 18 rivers other than the four major tributaries of the Yangtze River and the scattered water sources will also be gradually dredged and rectified, striving to ensure reliable irrigation for more than 90% of the province's paddy fields in about 3 years. At the same time, 70% of the province's slopes will be converted into terraced fields, flat land, and paddy fields in batches within 5 years, and various drainage ditches and large and small sedimentation ponds will be dug to achieve "ditches everywhere, ponds everywhere," maintain soil and water, and improve drought resistance.
    In order to expand the cultivated land area, strive to reclaim 10 million mu of wasteland on the northwestern Sichuan grassland within 12 years. The Ruo'ergai Grassland in northwestern Sichuan will be developed into a new production area for grain and industrial raw materials. On that vast grassland where the Red Army passed during the Long March, in addition to 20 million mu of muddy areas and primitive forests, there are also more than 20 million mu of pastoral land and more than 20 million mu of arable land. It is rich in large horses, yaks, sheep, fur, and also produces highland barley, wheat, sugar beets, and potatoes. Longri, Aba, and Ruo'ergai have now established agricultural experiment stations, farms, and state-owned mechanized farms. The sound of tractors is noisy on the silent grassland. Soon, more state-owned mechanized farms and pastures will appear on the grassland.
    The Sichuan Basin, surrounded by mountains, is also rich in industrial crops such as cotton, tea, silk, and hemp; the famous local specialties, such as medicinal materials, tung oil, white wax, gallnuts, and fungus, are more than 700 kinds. Sichuan is suitable for planting mulberry and raising silkworms. In 1955, silk production reached 23% of the national output. Many agricultural cooperatives engaged in mulberry and silkworm cultivation not only found a way out for surplus labor and increased sideline income, but also used silkworm excrement to increase fertilizer. In the silkworm-producing areas covering 85 counties, more than 46,000 villages, and 42 million people, if each village realizes the plan of planting 30,000 to 50,000 mulberry trees, then in 7 years, the province can produce 3.61 million dan of cocoons and 410,000 quintals of silk. The export of these silk alone can be exchanged for 80 Chengdu-Chongqing Railway rails.
    Although Sichuan is rich in products, many rich treasures could not be fully utilized in the past due to the obstruction of mountains and rivers. The situation of "the difficulty of the Shu Road is more difficult than reaching the sky" has been fundamentally changed in the past few years due to the construction and development of railways such as Chengdu-Chongqing, Baoji-Chengdu, and many highways and waterways; however, even today, among the province's 192 counties and 11 cities, there are still 66 counties that are not accessible by highway. Due to traffic congestion in the vast rural areas and remote mountainous areas, a large number of agricultural products and local specialties cannot be transported out. In some places, there are still things like exchanging a few packs of needles for a chicken and burning medicinal materials as firewood. In order to make Sichuan's transportation catch up with the needs of the rapid development of the national economy, the state is accelerating the construction of railways such as Baoji-Chengdu, Chengdu-Kunming, and Sichuan-Guizhou, and at the same time, the province will also build more than 30,000 kilometers of simple highways. In 7 years, people can take trains from the capital to the southwestern border of the motherland, and reach all counties, agricultural machinery stations, industrial and mining areas, forest areas, and state-owned farms in Sichuan along the well-connected highways. Sichuan has a dense river network, with 89 rivers connecting most cities and villages. Inland river transportation with tens of thousands of miles accounts for more than 50% of the province's total transportation volume. In the future, we must vigorously develop inland river shipping, and plan to dredge and open up 59 new waterways with a total length of more than 8,000 kilometers.
    Sichuan, which is very rich in hydropower resources, provides superior conditions for gradually realizing rural electrification. In addition to the Longxi River and Minjiang River hydropower stations that are under construction and investigation, and the large-scale power projects such as the future Three Gorges Hydropower Station, the Yangtze River and its tributaries Wujiang River, Jialing River, Fujiang River and other more than 80 rivers across the province, as well as the large weirs, canals, and small reservoirs all over the place, can use waterfalls to build hydropower stations. Now Sichuan already has more than 30 small hydropower stations; it is estimated that within 7 to 10 years, the province's 8,000 townships can basically build a small hydropower station in each township or several townships. At that time, cheap electricity will be widely used for lighting, oil extraction, rice milling, and irrigation.
    All these beautiful visions are encouraging the people to work harder and more creatively!

    把“天府之国”变得更加繁荣
    本报记者　纪希晨
    在充满希望的春天，描述自己的家乡的远景的民歌，流行在四川的农村里：“红山变青山，桑树栽满园，稻麦粮棉装满仓，柑橘柠檬栽院前，鸡鸭猪兔喂满圈，修塘放水灌稻田。”在充满远大理想的歌声中，人们还希望拖拉机开进自己的田野，希望在乡村的道路上飞驰着汽车，希望奔腾的河流发出无穷的电力，通向遥远的地方……
    全国产粮最多的四川省，解放后连续6年丰收，粮食生产水平不断提高。远在第一个五年计划开始前，1952年，全省粮食总产量就达到了323亿斤，超过了历史上最高年产量。1953年粮食总产量上升到351亿斤，1954年又增加到375亿斤，1955年又达到400多亿斤。四川省每年都能有大批粮食运往各地，支援国家建设。在讨论全国农业发展纲要草案的时候，四川人民决心把粮食产量提高到更高的水平：争取提前在7年内，把每亩土地产量由现在的404斤增加到800斤；把全省粮食总产量由1956年的445亿斤提高到1962年的800亿斤。这就不仅比解放前1947年的270亿斤几乎增加了两倍，而且比1938年历史上的最高产量320亿斤增加了一倍半；这使全省人民有可能除自己食用和保证国家需要的粮食以外，在12年内，一切以生产稻、麦为主的地区，都储备足够两年食用的余粮。　　实现这个增产计划是完全可能的。四川省的农业生产有极大的潜在力量。这里，气候温和，雨量充足，土地肥沃，南方和北方的各种农作物应有尽有，人们亲切的称呼她为“天府之国”。在四周环抱盆地的山区和绵延2，000里的长江两岸的丘陵间，除了水稻、麦子以外，还盛产玉蜀黍、棉花和甘薯。围绕着山坡的层层叠叠的梯田里，有许多地方现在每亩地的粮食产量已经达到700多斤。富饶美丽的川西平原上，有全国著名的水稻、菜籽和烟草、麻；在四季常青的大地上，一年可收获三、四季庄稼。成都西充农业合作社，去年就在大面积土地上使每亩平均产量达到1，150斤以上。
    除了优越的自然条件以外，农业合作化的发展对保证增产更具有决定作用。1月底，加入农业合作社的农户已经达全省总农户的77％。1956年秋，入社农户将达90％。1958年，全省就可实现完全社会主义的农业合作化。这给农业生产的大量增加带来无限的希望和力量。
    为争取超额完成今年的农业增产任务，无论山区、丘陵和平原，到处都沸腾着生产的高潮。宜宾、泸县、温江、新繁等地的许多农业合作社，热烈开展每亩千斤的增产竞赛。沱江流域内江、简阳等地在“百斤棉、千斤粮、万斤蔗”的口号下，普遍进行土地加工，把低产地变成高产田。遂宁专区农民以移山倒海的伟大气魄，把高山坡开辟成层层的梯田，新修水塘3，000多口，使90多万亩耕地得到改良。
    为确保农业增产，全省除普遍推广优良品种、推广新式农具、多种高产作物、努力开辟肥源、改良土壤、消灭虫害以外，还要大力改进耕作制度，扩大复种面积，使全省70％多的耕地，都普遍种植两、三季作物，把土地利用率由1955年的148％扩大到226％。仅仅这一项，就可以增产粮食140亿斤。为了解决复种面积扩大后的肥料和水源问题，全省将大量开发蕴藏丰富的磷矿、泥炭，推广混合堆肥，兴修大批塘堰、拦水坝、山弯塘和囤水田。对于长江四大支流以外的18条河流和分散的水源，也要逐步加以疏整，争取在3年左右，使全省90％以上的水田都获得可靠的灌溉保证。同时，还要把全省的70％的坡地，在5年内分批改为梯田、平地和水田，修挖各种排水沟和大小沉沙池，做到“地地有沟，沟沟有池”，保持水土，提高抗旱力。
    为了扩大耕地面积，争取12年内在川西北草原上，开垦出1，000万亩荒地。川西北若尔盖大草原，将被开发成粮食和工业原料的新产地。在那当年红军长征经过的辽阔的大草原上，除两千万亩泥泞地带和原始森林以外，还有两千万多亩畜牧地和两千多万亩可耕地。那里盛产大马、牦牛、绵羊、皮毛，还出产青稞、小麦、甜菜、马铃薯。龙日、阿坝、若尔盖现在已建立起农业试验站、农牧场和国营机耕农场。寂静的草原上，喧闹起了拖拉机的声音。不久之后，将会有更多的国营机耕农场、牧场出现在草地上。
    群山环抱的四川盆地，还盛产棉、茶、丝、麻等技术作物；著名的土特产，如药材、桐油、白蜡、五棓子、木耳等，就有700多种。四川宜于栽桑养蚕，1955年，蚕丝生产达全国产量的23％。许多经营蚕桑的农业合作社，不仅为多余劳动力寻找了出路，增加了副业收入，还用蚕沙增加了肥料。在遍及85个县、46，000多个村庄和4，200万人口的宜桑地区，如果每个村庄都实现了种植3万到5万株桑树的计划，那末，7年之后，全省就可产茧361万担，产丝41万公担。只是这些蚕丝出口，就可以换回80条成渝铁路的钢轨。
    四川物产虽然丰富，但是许多富饶的宝藏，过去都因为山川阻隔而不能充分利用。“蜀道之难，难于上青天”的情况，几年来虽然由于成渝、宝成等铁路和许多公路、河道的修筑开发，已经根本改观；可是，直到今天，全省192个县和11个市中，仍有66个县不通公路。广大农村和遥远山区，因为交通阻塞，大批农产品和土特产运不出来，个别地方甚至仍然存在着几包针换一只鸡和把药材当柴烧的事情。为使四川交通迎头赶上国民经济迅速发展的需要，国家正加速修筑宝成、成昆、川黔等铁路，同时省内还要兴修3万多公里简易公路。7年之后，人们可以乘火车从首都到达祖国的西南边疆，并沿着四通八达的公路，到达四川所有的县城、农业机器站、工矿、林区和国营农场。四川河网密布，89条江河连结着大部城市和乡村，通航万里的内河运输，占全省运输总量的50％以上。今后，还要大力发展内河航运事业，计划疏通和开辟59条长达8，000多公里的新航道。
    水力资源十分丰富的四川，对逐步实现农村电气化提供了优越的条件。除正在修筑和勘察的龙溪河和岷江水电站，未来的长江三峡水电站等大型电力工程以外，横贯全省的长江和它的支流乌江、嘉陵江、涪江等80多条河流，以及遍布各地的大堰、渠道、小水库，都可以利用跌水修筑水电站。现在四川已经有30多座小型水电站；预计在7至10年以内，全省8，000个乡可以基本上做到每一个乡或几个乡建设一个小型水电站。那时，廉价的电力，将被人们广泛用来照明、榨油、碾米和灌溉。
    这一切美好的远景，都鼓舞着人民更加奋发地进行创造性的劳动！
