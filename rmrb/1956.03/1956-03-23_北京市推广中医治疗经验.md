    Beijing Promotes Experience in Traditional Chinese Medicine Treatment
    The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Public Health convened a meeting on the 20th to promote experience in traditional Chinese medicine treatment.
    In 1955, municipal medical units in Beijing used traditional Chinese medicine treatment methods to treat various diseases, achieving very good results. The Beijing Children's Hospital and the Beijing Second Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic used Coptis chinensis mixture, Purslane decoction, and Coptis chinensis and Evodia rutaecarpa mixture to treat 69 patients with acute bacterial dysentery and chronic dysentery, all of whom were cured. Red mercuric sulfide ointment is a Chinese medicine that is most widely used in surgery for debridement and promoting tissue regeneration. The Beijing First Hospital used red mercuric sulfide ointment to treat chronic tuberculous lymphadenitis ulcers and surgical wounds that had not healed for a long time, with very good results. The application of acupuncture to treat diseases of the ear, nose, and throat, poliomyelitis, and rheumatic arthritis has also achieved good results in some medical units.

    北京市推广中医治疗经验
    北京市公共卫生局在二十日召开了推广中医治疗经验的会议。
    1955年，北京市市属医疗单位用中医的治疗方法治疗各科病症，取得了很好疗效。北京市儿童医院和北京市第二中医门诊部用黄连合剂、马齿苋煎剂、香连合剂等治疗六十九名急性细菌性痢疾和慢性痢疾的患者，全部治愈。中药红升丹是中医学在外科的去腐生新方面，应用最广的一种药品。北京市第一医院用红升丹治疗慢性淋巴腺结核溃疡和手术后久不愈合的创口，效果很好。应用针灸疗法治疗耳鼻咽喉科的病症、小儿麻痹症、风湿性关节炎等也在一些医疗单位中取得了很好的效果。
