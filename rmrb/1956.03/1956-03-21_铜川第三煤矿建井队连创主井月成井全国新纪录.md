    Tongchuan Third Coal Mine Construction Team Repeatedly Sets New National Monthly Shaft Sinking Records for Main Shafts
    The Third Shaft Construction Team of the Tongchuan Engineering Office of the Xi'an Coal Mine Basic Construction Bureau, in the construction of the Wangjiahe No. 1 vertical shaft project, set new national records for monthly main shaft sinking for three consecutive months from December last year to the end of February this year.
    In the construction, this shaft construction team conscientiously studied the Soviet advanced experience of the multi-cycle operation method. Originally, they could not even complete three cycles in two days. Later, they were able to complete two cycles in one day. In December last year, they set a new record of 53.42 meters per month for single-line operation of the main shaft. At the end of January this year, they set a new national record of 59.32 meters per month for the main shaft. In February, there were only twenty-odd days excluding holidays, but they completed 51.10 meters per month for the main shaft, and their quota of two cycles a day was also broken.

    铜川第三煤矿建井队连创主井月成井全国新纪录
    西安煤矿基本建设局铜川工程处第三建井队在建设王家河一号竖井工程中，从去年十二月到今年二月底，连续三个月都创造了主井月成井的全国纪录。
    这个建井队在施工中认真学习多循环作业法的苏联先进经验，原来两天三个循环还做不到，后来一天能做到两个循环，在去年十二月创造了单行作业主井月进53.42公尺的新纪录。今年一月底他们又创造了主井月进59.32公尺的全国纪录。二月份除了假日只有二十多天，但是他们又完成了主井月进51.10公尺，一天两个循环的定额也被他们打破了。
