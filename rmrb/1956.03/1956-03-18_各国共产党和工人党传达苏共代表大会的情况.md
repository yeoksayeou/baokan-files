Xinhua News Agency, March 15th, TASS, Budapest, March 14th: The Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party held a plenary session in Budapest on March 12th and 13th. The plenary session heard a report by Mátyás Rákosi, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party, on the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
    After discussion, the Central Committee unanimously adopted Rákosi's report and a resolution on the report.

Xinhua News Agency, March 17th, TASS, Rome, March 16th: "Unità" published a report by Palmiro Togliatti, General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, to the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party on the situation of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the resolution of the Central Committee of the Party.
    Togliatti first emphasized the great historical significance of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the resolutions it passed for the whole world. The Congress correctly assessed the new things that have emerged in the world and drew fundamental conclusions. Togliatti spoke about the issue of the possibility of war breaking out while imperialism still exists. He stressed that at present, there are forces in the world sufficient to prevent war, and the Italian working class is an integral part of this force. Peace supporters around the world are one of the factors promoting changes in the world's political structure.
    When talking about the speeches and statements made by Italian President Gronchi during his visit to the United States, Togliatti welcomed the new factors contained in Gronchi's statements, believing that these factors reflected the deep desire of the majority of the Italian people to change Italy's foreign policy. They hope that Italy's foreign policy will no longer slavishly submit to the plans and schemes of American imperialism and other imperialist countries, but will become a policy that helps Italy make an effective contribution to the cause of easing international tensions and the cause of peace. When talking about this contribution, Togliatti asked: "Can Italy implement its own policy of peace? Why doesn't the Italian government proactively sign a non-aggression pact between Italy and the Soviet Union through direct contact, which is easy to do?"
    Subsequently, Togliatti spoke about the possibility of various countries developing towards socialism through different paths. Togliatti said: The Italian Communist Party is acting quite bravely in this regard. "We are always concerned with finding our own Italian path towards socialism. For example, we cannot fail to see that we currently have a constitution that stipulates many fundamental reforms, which ultimately have a socialist spirit. This should be thanked to the fact that the Communists did not venture to seize power in 1946, but on the contrary, chose to participate in the work of the Constituent Assembly. If we are currently able to raise the question of the path to socialism from a new perspective, study the possibility of different paths for different countries, if we can say that we have the possibility of widely using paths like parliament for major social reforms, if we can currently talk about and do all this, it is only because we have experienced decades of struggle and have achieved results that have changed the face and structure of the world."
    Togliatti then spoke about the struggle of the Communists in certain capitalist countries, especially Italy. Togliatti pointed out the decline of the influence of the Social Democratic Party and the actions of organized Catholic working masses. He stressed that it is necessary to fight for the progressive movements of the workers' movement and all working masses to achieve new, more consolidated and broader unity, and this unity is the decisive condition for Italy's development and profound social reforms.
    After discussing Togliatti's report, the Central Committee passed a resolution, which expressed its approval of Togliatti's report and expressed its deep satisfaction with the significant new contributions made by the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in raising and solving several basic issues of socialist and communist construction and the international situation. The resolution called on all members of the Italian Communist Party to carefully study all the issues and valuable lessons raised in the speeches and resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, in order to further strengthen the Italian Communist Party, strengthen the Party's organization, and strengthen the Party's struggle for democracy, peace and socialism.

    各国共产党和工人党传达苏共代表大会的情况
    拉科西向匈劳动人民党中央全会作报告
    新华社15日讯　塔斯社布达佩斯14日讯：匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会3月12日和13日在布达佩斯举行了全体会议。全体会议听取了匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会第一书记拉科西所作的关于苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的报告。
    中央委员会经过讨论以后，一致通过了拉科西的报告和关于这个报告的决议。
    陶里亚蒂向意共中央全会作报告
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社罗马16日讯：“团结报”刊载了意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂在意大利共产党中央委员会全体会议上所作的关于苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的情况的报告和党中央委员会的决议。
    陶里亚蒂首先着重指出了苏联共产党第二十次代表大会和它通过的决议对于全世界具有的重大的历史意义。大会正确地估计了目前在全世界产生的新的东西，并且得出基本的结论。陶里亚蒂讲到在帝国主义仍然存在的情况下战争爆发的可能性的问题。他着重指出，目前，世界上存在着足以防止战争的力量，意大利工人阶级是这种力量的一个组成部分，全世界的和平拥护者，是促进世界政治结构发生变化的因素之一。
    陶里亚蒂在谈到意大利总统格隆基在访问美国时的演说和声明时，表示欢迎格隆基声明中所包含的新因素，认为这些因素反映了意大利人民中大多数人希望改变意大利的外交政策的深切愿望。他们希望意大利的外交政策不再奴颜婢膝地屈从于美帝国主义和其他帝国主义国家的计划和图谋，而成为有助于意大利给缓和国际紧张局势的事业、和平事业作出有效贡献的政策。陶里亚蒂谈到这种贡献时问道：“意大利能不能做到实行自己的和平政策呢？为什么意大利政府不主动地通过很容易做到的直接接触而签订意苏互不侵犯协定呢？”
    随后，陶里亚蒂谈到了各个国家经过不同的道路向社会主义发展的可能性。陶里亚蒂说：意大利共产党在这方面是相当勇敢地行动的。“我们经常关心的事情就是找寻我们意大利朝向社会主义发展的道路。例如，我们不能不看到，我们目前有一部规定许多根本改革的宪法，这些改革终究具有社会主义的精神，这应当感谢共产党人在1946年没有冒险地企图夺取政权，而是恰恰相反，选择了参加立宪会议工作的道路。如果说我们目前能够从新的角度来提出关于向社会主义过渡的途径的问题，研究各国互不相同的途径的可能性，如果我们能够说我们有可能广泛地利用像议会这种途径来进行重大的社会改革，如果我们目前能够谈论和做这一切，那只是因为我们经历过几十年的斗争和获得了改变世界面貌和结构的成果。”
    陶里亚蒂随后讲到关于某些资本主义国家、首先是意大利的共产党人的斗争的问题。陶里亚蒂指出社会民主党影响的低落和有组织的天主教劳动群众的行动，他着重指出必须要进行斗争，争取工人运动和一切劳动群众的进步运动获得新的、更为巩固和广泛的团结一致，而这种团结就是意大利的发展和深刻的社会改革的决定性的条件。
    在讨论了陶里亚蒂的报告之后，中央委员会通过一个决议，决议表示赞同陶里亚蒂的报告，并且表示深深满意苏共第二十次代表大会在提出和解决社会主义和共产主义建设以及国际局势若干基本问题方面所作的重大的新贡献。决议号召意大利共产党全体党员精心研究苏共第二十次代表大会上的发言和决议中提出的一切问题和宝贵的教训，以便更加加强意大利共产党、加强党的组织，加强党争取民主、和平和社会主义的斗争。
