A new record for the total railway freight loading throughout the country was set on March 14th, exceeding the state-stipulated daily loading target for 1957. Since the beginning of spring, the railway freight supply has been very strong. In February, national railways transported more than 30,000 tons of goods per day than in January. In the first half of March, the average daily freight volume was more than 30,000 tons higher than the February average, but this still could not meet the demands of shippers.

The rapid increase in railway freight volume indicates a rapid improvement in railway transport efficiency. In addition, the main reason is that industrial and agricultural production and basic construction units across the country are striving to complete and overfulfill the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Therefore, the amount of mineral building materials such as bricks, tiles, and cement, as well as timber and steel products, entrusted to the railways for transportation in March by various units increased by about 30% compared to February. In March, dozens more train cars of new agricultural tools and chemical fertilizers were shipped to rural areas every day. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    铁路货物装车量新纪录
    3月14日全国铁路总的货物装车量出现了最新纪录，超过了国家规定的1957年每日装车量的指标。今春以来，铁路货源很旺。2月比1月，全国铁路每天都多运3万多吨货物。3月上半月平均每天运出的货物，比2月份平均每天运出的货物又多3万多吨，但是仍然不能满足货主的要求。
    铁路货物运输量迅速增涨标志着铁路运输效率提高很快。除此之外，主要原因是，全国工业农业生产和基本建设各单位，都在争取提前和超额完成第一个五年计划。因此，各单位在3月里委托铁路运输的砖、瓦、水泥等矿物性建筑材料和木材、钢铁产品等，都比2月增涨30％左右。3月里运往农村的新式农具和化学肥料每天也多几十车。　（据新华社讯）
