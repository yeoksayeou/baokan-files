Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 27th (TASS):
Comrades! In summing up the period that has been discussed, the Central Committee of our Party, holding high the great banner of the immortal Lenin, has led the country to all new victories.

The Central Committee, by being faithful to this banner, by strictly adhering to Lenin's principles of collective leadership and inner-Party democracy, and by continuously expanding the Party's ties with the people, has earned all the great achievements of our Party and country before this 20th Congress. There is no doubt that the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union occupies an important place in the history of our Party's struggle for communism and is a major contribution to the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism.

The summary report of the Central Committee creatively developed several of the most important principles of Marxism theory under new historical conditions.

Comrade Khrushchev's report expounded the most complex issues of world development in a way that could be clearly understood by the broad masses of working people, the report warmly called for the establishment of friendship between the peoples of all countries, and unfolded an attractive prospect for the forward movement of socialist forces. This report has given millions upon millions of people struggling for peace the great belief that a new world war can be prevented.

Comrade Bulganin's instructions to the Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union regarding the Sixth Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the Soviet Union, concretely embodies the most important programmatic provisions of the Communist Party in the recent period. The instructions are permeated from beginning to end with the goal of achieving a rapid surge in the Soviet national economy and concern for the welfare of the people.

The new Five-Year Plan stipulates the priority development of heavy industry - this is the material and technical basis for the further surge of all sectors of the national economy.

The achievement of the total agricultural output stipulated in the draft instructions will enable us to almost completely provide residents with abundant main products and provide the light industry with abundant raw materials.

The new Five-Year Plan will promote the further consolidation and expansion of economic cooperation with the People's Democratic countries and promote the expansion of business ties with other countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

The speed of the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union stipulated in the new Five-Year Plan is very fast, but it is absolutely realistic, and the Sixth Five-Year Plan will be completed ahead of schedule. There is no doubt that the instructions of the Sixth Five-Year Plan will be unanimously approved by the 20th Congress of our Party, just as it has already been unanimously approved by the entire Soviet people. (Applause)

Comrade Khrushchev's and Comrade Bulganin's reports profoundly and scientifically analyzed the state of socialist agriculture, exposed the major mistakes and shortcomings in agriculture before 1953, and pointed out the main directions for the further development of agricultural production in various sectors.

As pointed out in the summary report of the CPSU Central Committee: "Our main task in agriculture is to increase the total annual output of grain to 11 billion poods by the end of the Sixth Five-Year Plan by increasing the yield per unit area and reclaiming more new land; to expand the sown area of industrial raw material crops such as cotton, sugar beet, flax, hemp, sunflower seeds, etc., and greatly increase their yield per unit area; greatly expand the production of potatoes and other vegetables."

The draft instructions of the Sixth Five-Year Plan stipulate an increase of 56% in seed cotton production, 35% in flax fiber, 54% in sugar beet, 85% in potatoes, 1.2 times in vegetables, double in meat and milk, 1.5 times in eggs, and 0.8 times in wool.

We have all the conditions to achieve such a huge increase in the production of agricultural products, the socialist economic form occupies a unique dominant position in the countryside, we have a dense network of machine tractor stations, a powerful and advanced socialist industry provides agriculture with first-class technical equipment, and tens of thousands of skilled experts and organizers work in agriculture.

The Soviet state has invested 63.6 billion rubles in agriculture in the past five years alone, which is seven times that of the First Five-Year Plan and two and a half times that of the Fourth Five-Year Plan. According to the materials of the Soviet State Planning Commission, in the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the investment in agriculture will be almost twice that of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, five times that of the Fourth Five-Year Plan, and almost fourteen times that of the First Five-Year Plan.

With the above-listed political, organizational and technical, and material conditions, as long as we make full use of them, comrades, we can not only complete, but also complete ahead of schedule, the tasks of developing agriculture stipulated in the Sixth Five-Year Plan. Just as many comrades have already talked about at this Congress, not only individual collective farms, state farms, and districts, but also entire states and entire republics have put forward guarantees to complete the tasks of developing grain and animal husbandry production stipulated in the Five-Year Plan in one or two years.

The huge work carried out in reclaiming virgin and fallow land proves the possibility of huge development of our agriculture. In 1956, the area sown on the land reclaimed in the past two years reached more than 33 million hectares, of which state farms accounted for more than 13 million hectares. In order to properly estimate the scale of these truly great works, we might as well look at it this way: the sown area in the Soviet Union increased by 23.5 million hectares in the 12 years from 1928 to 1940, and the area sown by state farms on the newly reclaimed wasteland in 1956 was more than the total sown area of state farms in 1940.

Completing the tasks in agricultural development in the Sixth Five-Year Plan in the shortest possible time should be the main content of our Party's organizational work and propaganda work among the people.

We have huge potential in agriculture that has not been well utilized, and tapping and fully utilizing all potential is of great significance to our entire work of completing the Sixth Five-Year Plan tasks ahead of schedule. The struggle to prevent grain losses during harvesting can be cited as an example. The most important method to prevent losses here is to carry out harvesting in a compact time, and to complete harvesting within 7 to 10 days from the start of grain maturity. However, many collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms harvest grain in 15 to 20 days, or even more, so generally, 2 to 3 quintals, or even more, of grain are lost per hectare.

The time of harvest can be shortened and grain losses can be reduced by using the segmented harvesting method. As early as 1931 to 1932, the practice of scientific research institutions and many state farms proved that with the segmented harvesting method, harvesting can begin in the waxy maturity stage, 5 to 7 days earlier than usual, and with this method, more than 2 quintals can be harvested per hectare. However, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Department of State Farms, disregarding the huge advantages of the segmented grain harvesting method, have buried this advanced method for more than 20 years and have not turned it into the wealth of all collective farms and state farms in the country. The January Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee particularly sharply raised the issue of preventing harvest losses, and only after this, the issue of segmented grain harvesting was turned to practical aspects.

In 1955, 50,000 racks of harvesting combine harvesters and 85,000 pick-up machines were manufactured for machine tractor stations and state farms. The land area harvested by the segmented harvesting method was 1.7 million hectares, which is less than 2% of the grain harvesting area. The collective farms in Belgorod Oblast, Kuibyshev Oblast, Lipetsk Oblast, Ulyanovsk Oblast, Balashov Oblast, and Voronezh Oblast most widely adopted the segmented harvesting method, and they used the segmented harvesting method to harvest on 8% to 14% of the grain-growing land. However, Molotov Oblast, Kemerovo Oblast, Tyumen Oblast, Arzamas Oblast, and many other oblasts did not implement segmented harvesting last year.

If we could have used the segmented harvesting method on 25% of the grain-growing land in 1955, and if we could have harvested just two more quintals of grain per hectare from the segmented harvesting land, then we could have harvested more than 350 million poods of grain.

Of course, the universal promotion of the advanced method of segmented harvesting not only requires attention to this method, but also requires the establishment of certain technical tools for segmented harvesting. However, the machinery for segmented harvesting currently owned by machine tractor stations and state farms is only enough to be used on 5 to 6 million hectares, that is, 4% to 5% of the grain planting area, which is completely insufficient. In order to meet the minimum requirements of various oblasts for machines and linked combine harvesters, at least 100,000 more grain cutters and 150,000 pick-up machines need to be supplied to agriculture outside the plan in 1956 for harvesting in this way.

Therefore, the production of grain cutters and pick-up machines must be greatly increased so that we have more technical tools to implement segmented grain harvesting in 1956.

As has been repeatedly pointed out, expanding the planting area of ​​corn is the main method of increasing grain production and strengthening the feed base of animal husbandry. Now there are many collective farms and state farms that are famous all over the country because these farms have changed the structure of the planting area, expanded the planting area of ​​corn, and as a result, have increased the total harvest of grain in a short period of time, established a solid feed base, and on this basis, have drastically improved the productivity of animal products, thus increasing their income and improving the material conditions of collective farmers.

In 1955, the corn planting area of ​​collective farms and state farms across the country was nearly 18 million hectares, while it was 4.3 million hectares in 1954. Due to the expansion of the corn planting area, it was possible to harvest more than 17 million tons of silage feed in the last agricultural year, including more than 6 million tons of silage ears, and improve the work of supplying animal husbandry with concentrate feed.

In 1955, the collective farms in the Ukrainian Republic expanded the planting area of ​​corn, thus making it possible to store an average of more than 6 tons of silage feed per cow, and 43 quintals of milky and waxy mature stage ears per sow. In the collective farms in Voronezh Oblast and Belgorod Oblast, 40 quintals of milky and waxy mature stage ears were prepared for each sow. However, the leaders of the local party organizations and Soviet organs in some oblasts, as well as the heads of machine tractor stations and state farms, and the chairmen of collective farms did not study the characteristics of this crop well, did not care about the work of selecting corn planting plots, adhered to conventions when deciding on planting dates and carrying out intertillage, and most importantly, did not organize and train manpower to carry out the work of cultivating corn, so the corn yield in these oblasts was of course very low.

The soil and climatic conditions in Ulyanovsk Oblast, Penza Oblast, and the Moldavian Autonomous Republic can enable corn for silage and corn for harvesting to obtain a bumper harvest. However, in 1955, the harvest of green stalks of corn in these oblasts was very low, and the ears of milky and waxy mature stage were not harvested at all. As a result, the collective farms in Penza Oblast harvested only 24 quintals of silage feed per hectare of corn planting area, 29 quintals in Ulyanovsk Oblast, and 37 quintals in the Moldavian Autonomous Republic. But comrades, this situation occurred precisely when the advanced collective farms in these two oblasts and the Moldavian Autonomous Republic obtained very high yields of green stalks and milky and waxy mature stage corn ears.

It is intolerable that the collective farms in the Georgian Republic and the Uzbek Republic had very low corn yields in 1955, but there they have particularly favorable soil and climatic conditions to plant and prepare corn and silage corn, and obtain stable bumper harvests. In particular, there is many years of experience in planting this valuable crop here.

In 1956, the planting area of ​​corn will be expanded. Our task is to cultivate cadres who are proficient in the agricultural technology of planting corn in all collective farms and state farms, so as to ensure a bumper harvest of this crop.

Rapidly changing to planting hybrid corn is one of the important sources of increasing corn yield. This year, agricultural organs, Soviet organs, and party organizations should carry out huge work to select some farms to cultivate hybrid seeds and supply them with the necessary technical equipment, and at the same time, they should organize extensive scientific research work to study methods of cultivating new hybrid seeds and propagating existing seeds.

The draft instructions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU on the Sixth Five-Year Plan stipulate a great expansion of the production of industrial raw material crops. The sugar beet planting area should reach at least 2.5 million to 2.6 million hectares in recent years, and the total sugar beet harvest should reach about 500 million quintals, so that the sugar production per capita can almost double.

To realize this plan, it is necessary to expand the sugar beet planting area and increase its yield per unit area in the main areas of sugar beet planting, and also to organize sugar beet production in many new areas, mainly in some states of the Russian Federation. Machine tractor stations and collective farms must be supplied with more advanced machines for sowing, intertillage, harvesting and loading sugar beets, and the work of supplying mineral fertilizers and chemical pesticides to sugar beet planting areas must be greatly expanded.

The mechanization of loading and unloading work is of great significance for reducing the consumption of labor in transporting sugar beets. Last year, I went to some collective farms in Tambov Oblast during the sugar beet harvest. Female collective farmers said: The sugar beet harvesting combine is a good machine, but it also needs a "mechanized peasant" to help us load sugar beets. The production of sugar beet loading machines is an urgent task of our industry.

To expand the production of sugar beets and promote the planting of sugar beets to new areas, it is also necessary to build new sugar factories and build roads in sugar beet planting areas. When designing and building new factories, the production capacity of the factories must be determined according to the reasonable radius of the raw material production area. The construction of new factories should be realized in a short period of time, and the situation that has occurred in Krasnodar Krai in recent years cannot be allowed. There, the planting area of ​​sugar beets has been expanded from 17,000 hectares to 37,000 hectares, but the processing of sugar beets has not been guaranteed. As a result, a large part of the sugar beets planted in Krasnodar Krai has to be transported to the Ukrainian Republic, Voronezh Oblast, and other states for processing, which loses a lot of sugar, causes the state to pay extra expenses, and adds unreasonable burdens to the transportation industry.

The measures taken by the Party and the government to rapidly improve agriculture and increase livestock products in our country have achieved good results. In 1955, the amount of milk, meat, eggs, and wool purchased by the state greatly exceeded that of 1954. The material living conditions of the working people are constantly improving, but their growing demand for livestock products cannot be fully met now. We still have a lot of work to do in further improving the production of livestock products.

The task of increasing meat production and making pork account for 50% of the total meat production in our country, mainly by developing the pig industry that can grow the fastest, is a huge and important thing.

In our country, the growth of pork production is still very slow. We should produce at least 30 quintals of pork per 100 hectares of cultivated land on average, but we are producing too little now.

The situation of pork production in the country is unsatisfactory, and the situation in collective farms and state farms is even more so. This can only be explained by the following reasons: in many places, the pig industry is, to put it mildly, not good at it, and no measures have been taken to fully ensure that the pig industry has sufficient feed and pig pens, and the pigs are allowed to die in large numbers. Due to the fault of the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and the Soviet Ministry of State Farms, the problem of pig breeding has actually been confused. At that time, they required collective farms and state farms to sell mainly lard pigs and semi-lard pigs, but ignored the fastest-growing and cheapest meat pigs and ham pigs.

The Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union corrected this mistake of the agricultural organs. The current task is to give full play to the huge potential of the pig industry and rapidly increase the domestic pork production in the short term.

In 1960, the output of pork should be increased to 2.6 times that of 1955, and 5.5 times in collective farms, that is, accounting for about 50% of the total meat production.

From 1956, the mass fattening of pigs should be carried out on a large scale. All winter-born and spring-born piglets should be taken for mass fattening. Special supervision should be carried out on the work of fattening pigs. Currently, the leaders of some states and districts have talked a lot about pig raising, but have done nothing in terms of preserving the winter-born piglets of collective farms. As of February 1 this year, the collective farms in the 78 states, border regions, and republics of the Russian Federation had only fattened more than 900,000 pigs in total, while the collective farms in Ukraine had fattened 1.65 million pigs, or almost twice as many as the former. This situation does not seem to be accidental.

The shortcoming in our work in the countryside is that we have not fully utilized the superiority of the socialist system, and this situation has occurred because we often do not study the essence of the events taking place in the countryside in a solid and in-depth manner, and often do not organize work in accordance with the objective requirements of operating socialist agriculture. We do not summarize the phenomena occurring in economic development enough. Our scientists, especially economists, have written a lot and talked a lot about the superiority of collective farms, state farms, and machine tractor stations, but they have rarely studied how to fully utilize this superiority to increase the production of grain, meat, milk, vegetables, cotton, and other agricultural products.

All this has hindered the development of agriculture, because the outdated things have not been exposed and eliminated, and the new and progressive things that have emerged in development have often not received timely and due support.

The great significance of the resolutions of the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the subsequent plenary sessions lies first and foremost in the fact that these resolutions, on the basis of a deep analysis of all aspects of life, made creative developments to the Marxist-Leninist doctrine on the future development path of socialist agriculture. In these resolutions, the Party, in accordance with Lenin's principles, exposed everything that is currently hindering the exertion of the superiority of the socialist system, and armed the country with a scientifically based plan to rapidly develop agriculture.

In the process of our country's development, many problems have occurred and will occur in the future that need to be studied, deeply synthesized, and resolved. Our economic science should play a great role in this regard. We should not spare any effort to greatly expand the production of agricultural products, but only to pay the least amount of labor and funds for each unit of product. The issue of implementing the correct and scientifically based allocation and specialization of various agricultural production sectors in various natural and economic regions of our country is one of the most important issues that we need to solve correctly and quickly.

In order to rationally carry out agricultural production, it is necessary to plant and raise those crops and livestock in various regions that can obtain the highest product productivity under the local natural conditions. At the same time, it is also necessary to take into account the experience of local residents in cultivating certain crops and livestock.

For example, everyone knows that the northwestern states of the Russian Federation have excellent conditions to produce flax, potatoes, and increase milk production on the basis of planting clover and increasing corn production. However, in these states, the planting of long-fiber flax, clover, and potatoes has been reduced, and milk production has been reduced, while the planting of spring wheat, which cannot obtain high yields there, has been expanded. Krasnodar Krai has particularly excellent conditions to develop the pig industry on the basis of expanding corn production.

Some agricultural economists have separated themselves from the daily practice of collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms, do not engage in specific economic work, do not study the economic effects of certain economic sectors, and some economists deny the role of the law of value in collective farms. These comrades believe that it is impossible to calculate the cost of products in the collective farm economy, and other indicators must be used to calculate the time saving factors.

The attempt to list the principle of the least amount of socially necessary labor consumed on a unit of product as the most important factor in considering the allocation of agricultural production has been criticized. Some people believe that there is no category of cost in collective farms. The consequence of all this is that the issues of calculating production costs, costs, and labor productivity in collective farm production are not studied at all.

This theoretical confusion has contributed to an underestimation of the impact of price factors on the agricultural development process. Recently, the Central Committee of the Party has made huge changes to the existing level of requisition and purchase prices of many agricultural products, and these changes have played a major positive role in strengthening the material interests of collective farms and collective farmers in developing individual crops and sectors. The work of adjusting the prices of agricultural products should continue. The prices of many agricultural products were determined under production conditions different from those of today. Now, there are many kinds of prices for agricultural products (requisition prices, purchase prices, advance purchase prices, surcharges, etc.), and the prices of some agricultural products do not match the production costs of these products. The price ratio of some agricultural products should be determined according to the amount of material and labor consumption per unit of product, and this price ratio will be an important stimulus for the development of certain crops and agricultural sectors.

The phenomenon of backwardness in economic science should be eliminated. Agricultural economists should be required to seriously study the economic effects of the production of various crops and various sectors, to study the methods and measures to reduce the production costs of collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms and to reduce the costs of the agricultural products they produce, and to study the issues of increasing labor productivity, specialization of agricultural production, agricultural product prices, and the comparison of the benefits of agricultural land. Economic science should vigorously help the Party to carry out the work of transitioning machine tractor stations to economic accounting.

Economists should study and analyze the economic effects of new agronomic methods, new machines, plant varieties, and livestock breeds. Some published works of economists, agronomists, and machine operators (Bashuk's "Production Organization Work of Collective Farms" published in 1946, Sverchevsky's "Mechanization of Socialist Agriculture" published in 1953, and Sokolov's "Basic Knowledge of Crop Production" edited in 1955), without any economic analysis, simply publicize that harvesting grain crops directly by combine harvesters is a good way to harvest grain.

The task of economics is to widely synthesize the achievements and advanced experience of collective farms and state farms, and provide examples of rationally carrying out agricultural production with specific units.

In the period after the 19th Congress, the Party and the government, following Lenin's instructions on national issues, adopted a series of measures to eliminate the phenomenon of excessive concentration and greatly expanded the powers of the Councils of Ministers and the ministries of the federated republics and autonomous republics. These have helped to improve the creative initiative and initiative of local organs in carrying out economic and cultural construction tasks.

However, it should be said frankly that the activity of the Council of Ministers and the ministries of the Russian Federation has not increased much. At the past party congresses of states and border regions, the organs at the republic level of the Russian Federation have been criticized extremely sharply.

At the party congress of Kamensk Oblast, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation was criticized for its insufficient assistance and supervision of the work of the state administrations and for the existence of bureaucracy and bureaucracy in its leadership.

At the party congresses of Pskov Oblast and Kaliningrad Oblast, the Ministry of State Farms of the Russian Federation was sharply criticized for its unsatisfactory leadership of state farms. Comrade Zhinetsov, the director of the "Ostrov" State Poultry Farm in Pskov Oblast, said that in recent times, the variety of instructions has not only not decreased, but has increased. In the past year, the poultry farm has received 1,897 written instructions and orders from the ministry, most of which are unnecessary suggestions and opinions.

As you know, the leadership of the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation has now been strengthened. Now, the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation should quickly and resolutely overcome the shortcomings existing in its work.

It should be said that Comrade Khrushchev's proposal to establish the Russian Federation Bureau of the Central Committee of the CPSU is a very important measure that is sufficient to guarantee a great improvement in the situation of the states of the Russian Federation. There is no doubt that this proposal will be approved and implemented.

Comrades! The scale of our country's economic and cultural construction stipulated in the draft instructions makes every Soviet person proud of our great motherland, delighted with the superiority of the socialist economic system, infinitely grateful to the Communist Party that leads the country in building communism, and makes everyone want to work better and more as much as possible.

Our people are full of creativity. In the years of the establishment of the Soviet system, under the leadership of the Communist Party, they have completed many great tasks of world historical significance. Precisely because of this, our country is now a strong fortress of peace, democracy, and socialism.

The resolutions of the 20th Party Congress encourage our people, under the leadership of the beloved Communist Party, to establish new feats for the happiness and joy of the Soviet people and all progressive mankind. (Applause)

专栏：

    别利亚耶夫在苏共代表大会上的发言
    同志们！在总结所谈到的时期内，我们党的中央委员会高举着不朽的列宁的伟大旗帜，引导国家取得了一切新的胜利。
    中央委员会由于忠实于这面旗帜，最严格地遵守列宁的关于集体领导和党内民主的原则以及不断扩大党同人民的联系，而获得了我们党和国家在这次第二十次代表大会之前所取得的一切巨大成就。毫无疑问，苏联共产党第二十次代表大会在我们党为共产主义而斗争的历史中占有重要的地位，并且是对马克思列宁主义宝库的重大贡献。
    中央委员会的总结报告，在新的历史条件下创造性地发展了马克思主义理论中几项最重要的原则性原理。
    赫鲁晓夫同志的报告以广大劳动人民群众所能清楚理解的方式阐述了世界发展的最复杂的问题，报告热烈号召各国人民之间建立友谊，并且展开了社会主义力量向前运动的引人入胜的前景。这个报告使千千万万为和平而斗争的人们获得了可能防止新的世界大战的伟大信念。
    布尔加宁同志向代表大会说明的苏联共产党第二十次代表大会关于苏联发展国民经济第六个五年计划的指示，具体地体现了共产党在最近时期内的最重要的纲领性规定。指示从头到尾贯穿着达到苏联国民经济的急剧高涨和对人民福利的关怀的目标。
    新的五年计划规定优先发展重工业——这是国民经济各部门进一步高涨的物质技术基础。
    指示草案所规定的农业生产总量的达到，将使我们差不多可以完全做到为居民提供丰足的主要产品，为轻工业提供丰足的原料。
    新的五年计划将促使同人民民主国家的经济合作进一步巩固和扩大，促进同其他国家在平等互利的基础上扩大事务联系。
    新的五年计划规定的苏联发展国民经济的速度是很快的，但是又是绝对切合实际的，第六个五年计划将会提前完成。毫无疑问，第六个五年计划的指示将得到我们党的第二十次代表大会的一致赞成，正像它已经得到全体苏联人民的一致赞成一样。（掌声）一
    赫鲁晓夫同志和布尔加宁同志的报告深刻地、有科学论据地分析了社会主义农业的状况，揭露了1953年以前在农业中所犯的大错误和缺点，并且指出了进一步发展农业生产的各个部门的主要方向。
    正如苏共中央的总结报告中所指出的：“我们在农业方面的主要任务就是通过提高单位面积产量和开垦更多的新的土地的方法使谷物每年总产量在第六个五年计划结束的时候增加到110亿普特；扩大棉花、甜菜、亚麻、大麻、向日葵籽等工业原料作物的播种面积和大大增加它们的单位面积产量；大大扩大马铃薯和其他蔬菜的生产。”
    在第六个五年计划的指示草案中规定增产籽棉56％，亚麻纤维35％，甜菜54％，马铃薯85％，蔬菜一点二倍，肉类和牛奶一倍，蛋类一点五倍，羊毛零点八倍。
    我们是具备实现农产品生产这种巨大的增长的一切条件的，社会主义经济形态在乡村里占着独一无二的统治地位，我们有稠密的机器拖拉机站网，有强大而先进的社会主义工业向农业提供头等的技术装备，有成千成万熟练的专家和组织者在农业中工作。
    苏维埃国家仅在过去五年中对农业的投资就有636亿卢布，等于第一个五年计划的七倍，第四个五年计划的两倍半。根据苏联国家计划委员会的材料，在第六个五年计划中，对农业的投资差不多将是第五个五年计划的两倍，第四个五年计划的五倍，几乎是第一个五年计划的十四倍。
    有了上面所列举的政治上、组织技术上以及物质上的条件，只要我们充分地加以利用，同志们，我们就不但可以完成、而且可以在更短的期间超额完成第六个五年计划中所规定的发展农业的任务。正像许多同志们在这次代表大会上所已经谈到的那样，不仅个别的集体农庄、国营农场和区，而且整个州和整个共和国都提出了保证，要在一、两年内完成五年计划所规定的发展谷物和畜牧业生产的任务。
    在开垦生荒地和熟荒地上所进行的巨大的工作，证明了我们的农业有巨大发展的可能性。1956年，在最近两年开垦出来的土地上播种的面积达3，300万公顷以上，其中国营农场占1，300万公顷以上。为了恰当估计这些真正伟大的工作的规模，我们不妨这样看一看：苏联在1928到1940这12年内播种面积增加了2，350万公顷，而国营农场在1956年新开垦的荒地上播种的面积比1940年国营农场全部播种面积还要多。
    在最短期间内完成第六个五年计划在农业发展方面的任务，应当是我们在人民中进行的党组织工作和宣传工作的主要内容。
    我们在农业方面拥有巨大的潜力，还没有很好地加以利用，发掘和充分利用全部潜力对于我们全部提前完成第六个五年计划任务的工作具有重大意义。可以举出在收割时防止粮食损失的斗争为例。这里防止损失的最重要的方法就是在紧凑的时间内进行收割，从粮食成熟开始要在7到10天以内收割完毕。可是许多集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场收割粮食要15到20天，甚至更多的时间，因此，一般每公顷要损失粮食2到3公担，甚至更多一些。
    用分段收割法可以缩短收割时间和减少粮食损失。早在1931年到1932年间，科学研究机关和许多国营农场的实践就证明，用分段收割法，可以在蜡熟期就开始收割，比通常时期早5到7天，用这种方法每公顷可以多收2公担多。可是农业部和国营农场部不顾粮食分段收割法的巨大的优越性，20多年来一直埋没着这个先进方法，没有把它变成全国一切集体农庄和国营农场的财富。苏共中央委员会1月全体会议特别尖锐地提出了防止收割损失的问题，只是在这以后，粮食分段收割的问题才被转到实用方面。
    1955年，为机器拖拉机站和国营农场制造了5万台收获联合机收割台的架子和85，000台检拾机。用分段收割法收割的土地面积是170万公顷，还不到谷物收割面积的2％。别尔哥罗德州、古比雪夫州、利佩茨克州、乌里扬诺夫斯克州、巴拉绍夫州和沃罗涅日州的集体农庄最广泛地采用了分段收割的方法，它们用分段收割法在8％到14％的种谷物的土地上进行收割。但是莫洛托夫州、基米罗伏州、丘门州、阿尔扎马斯州和其他许多州在去年还没有实行分段收割。
    如果1955年我们只要能够用分段收割法在25％的种谷物的土地上进行收割，并且只要从分段收割的每公顷土地上多收获两公担的谷物，那么我们就可以多收获粮食35，000多万普特。
  当然，要普遍推广分段收割的先进方法不仅仅要求重视这个方法，并且要求为进行分段收割而建立一定的技术工具。但是，机器拖拉机站和国营农场现在拥有的分段收割用的机械只够在500到600万公顷，也就是4％—5％的谷物种植面积上使用，这是完全不够的。为了满足各州对机器、联挂联合机的最低要求，1956年还需要在计划以外再供给农业至少10万台刈谷机和15万台检拾机，以便进行这种方式的收割。
    所以，必须大大增加刈谷机和检拾机的产量，以便我们在1956年有更多的技术工具来实行谷物分段收割。
    正如屡次所指出的，扩大玉蜀黍的播种面积是增加谷物生产和加强畜牧业的饲料基地的主要方法。现在有许多集体农庄和国营农场在全国各个地方都很出名，因为这些农庄和农场改变了播种面积的结构，扩大了玉蜀黍的播种面积，结果在短时期内增加了谷物总收获量，建立了巩固的饲料基地，而且在这一基础上急遽提高了畜产品生产率，因此增加了自己的收入并且改善了集体农民的物质状况。
    1955年，全国各集体农庄和国营农场的玉蜀黍播种面积将近1，800万公顷，而在1954年为430万公顷。由于玉蜀黍播种面积的扩大，就有可能在上一个农业年度多收获1，700万吨青贮饲料，包括600多万吨青贮果穗，并且改善了供给畜牧业以精饲料的工作。
    1955年乌克兰共和国各集体农庄扩大了玉蜀黍的播种面积，因而可能平均给每头牛贮备6吨多青贮饲料，每口母猪43公担乳熟和蜡熟阶段的果穗。在沃罗涅日州和别尔哥罗德州各集体农庄中为每口母猪准备了40公担乳熟和蜡熟阶段的果穗。但是有些州的地方党组织和苏维埃机关的领导人，还有机器拖拉机站站长和国营农场场长、集体农庄主席没有好好地去研究这种作物的特点，不关心选择玉蜀黍播种地段的工作，在决定播种期限和进行中耕的时候墨守成规，而最主要的是没有组织和培养人力去进行培植玉蜀黍的工作，所以这些州里的玉蜀黍产量当然就很低。
    乌里扬诺夫斯克州、奔萨州和摩尔多夫自治共和国的土壤和气候条件，可以使作青贮饲料和收玉米用的玉蜀黍得到丰收。但是在1955年，这些州的玉蜀黍绿色茎秆的收获量很低，乳熟和蜡熟阶段的果穗完全没有收到。结果，奔萨州的集体农庄在每一公顷玉蜀黍播种面积上收获的青贮饲料只有24公担，乌里扬诺夫斯克州只有29公担，摩尔多夫自治共和国只有37公担。但是同志们，这种情况的发生正是在这两个州和摩尔多夫自治共和国的先进的集体农庄获得了很高的绿色茎秆和乳熟和蜡熟阶段的玉蜀黍果穗的收成的时候。
    令人不能容忍的是：格鲁吉亚共和国和乌兹别克共和国的集体农庄在1955年的玉蜀黍收获量很低，然而那里有着特别有利的土壤和气候条件来栽种和准备收获玉米和青贮饲料用的玉蜀黍，并且获得稳定的丰收。尤其是这里对于栽种这种有价值的作物具有许多年的经验。
    在1956年，玉蜀黍的播种面积将要扩大。我们的任务是：要在所有的集体农庄和国营农场中培养出精通种植玉蜀黍的农业技术的干部，这样就能保证这种作物获得丰收。
    迅速改播玉蜀黍杂交种，是提高玉蜀黍产量的重要源泉之一。在今年，农业机关、苏维埃机关和党组织就应该进行巨大的工作，选出一些农庄来培养杂交种子，并且供给它们必需的技术装备，同时还应该组织广泛的科学研究工作来研究培养新的杂交种子的方法和繁殖现有种子。
    苏共第二十次代表大会关于第六个五年计划的指示草案规定大大扩大工业原料作物的生产。甜菜种植面积在最近几年内至少要达到250万到260万公顷，而甜菜总收获量约达到5亿公担，这样，按人口计算的食糖产量差不多可以增加一倍。
    要实现这个计划，就必须在种植甜菜的主要地区扩大甜菜播种面积并且提高它的单位面积产量，而且还要在许多新区，主要是在俄罗斯联邦一些州组织甜菜的生产。必须以更多先进的播种、中耕、收获及装载甜菜用的机器供应机器拖拉机站和集体农庄，并且要大大扩大对甜菜种植区供应矿肥和化学毒剂的工作。
    装卸工作的机械化对减少运输甜菜的劳动力的消耗具有重大意义。去年在甜菜收获期间我曾经到过坦波夫州的一些集体农庄，女集体农民说：甜菜收获联合机是好机器，但是还需要“机械化的庄稼汉”来帮助我们装载甜菜。甜菜装载机器的生产是我们工业刻不容缓的任务。
    要扩大甜菜的生产、把甜菜的种植推广到新的地区，还需要在甜菜种植区建设新的制糖厂和修筑道路。在设计和建筑新工厂时，必须按照原料产区的合理半径来决定工厂的生产能力。新工厂的建筑应该在短期内实现，不能容许像最近几年来在克拉斯诺达边疆区所发生的那种情形，在那里，甜菜的播种面积已从17，000公顷扩大到37，000公顷，而甜菜的加工却没有保证。于是在克拉斯诺达边疆区种植的很大一部分甜菜就要运到乌克兰共和国、沃罗涅日州和其他州去加工，这就损失很多的糖，使国家付出多余的开支以及给运输业增加了不合理的负担。
    党和政府所采取的迅速提高农业和在我国增加畜产品的措施已经取得了良好的结果。1955年国家所征购的牛奶、肉、蛋类和羊毛大大地超过了1954年。劳动人民的物质生活条件不断地得到改善，但是他们对于畜产品日益增长的需求现在还不能得到完全的满足。在进一步提高畜产品的生产方面我们还要做很多的工作。
    首先靠发展可以最迅速地成长的养猪业来增加肉类生产以及使猪肉在我国肉类总产量中的比重达到50％的任务，是一件巨大而重要的事情。
    在我国，猪肉生产的增长还是非常慢。我们至少应该平均在每100公顷的耕地上生产30公担的猪肉，可是我们现在所生产的是太少了。
    全国的猪肉生产情况是不能令人满意的，而集体农庄和国营农场的情况更是这样。这只能是用下列原因来解释：很多地方对养猪业，客气地说，是不在行，没有采取各项措施来充分地保证养猪业有足够的饲料和猪舍，而听任猪大量死亡。由于苏联农业部和苏联国营农场部的过错，猪的饲养问题实际上曾经发生过混乱，当时它们要求集体农庄和国营农场交售的猪主要是油脂用猪和半油脂用猪，却忽略了成长最快、饲养又最便宜的肉用猪和腌制火腿用猪。
    苏共中央委员会和苏联部长会议纠正了农业机关的这个错误，目前的任务是，充分发挥养猪业的巨大的潜在能力，在短期内迅速增加国内猪肉的产量。
    1960年猪肉的产量应当增加到1955年的二点六倍，集体农庄增加到五点五倍，即占肉类总产量的50％左右。
    从1956年开始应当大规模进行猪的大批肥育工作。把全部冬季生的和春季生的小猪都拿来进行大批肥育。对肥育猪的工作应当进行特别的监督。目前有一些州和区的领导人在养猪问题上说了很多话，但是在保存集体农庄冬季生的小猪方面却什么也没有做。俄罗斯联邦的78个州、边疆区和共和国中的集体农庄到今年2月1日为止，全部肥育的猪只有90多万口，而乌克兰各集体农庄却肥育了165万口，或者说差不多是前者的两倍，这种情况看来不是偶然的。二
    我们在农村工作的缺点是：我们远没有完全利用社会主义制度的优越性，这种情况的发生，是因为我们经常没有踏实地深入地研究农村中发生的事件过程的本质，而且往往不是按照经营社会主义农业的客观要求来组织工作。我们对于经济发展中发生的现象总结得很不够，我们的科学家、首先是经济学家，关于集体农庄、国营农场和机器拖拉机站的优越性写得很多、讲得很多，然而却很少研究如何充分利用这种优越性来增加国家的谷物、肉类、奶类、蔬菜、棉花和其他农产品的生产。
    这一切妨碍了农业的发展，因为过时的东西没有被暴露，没有加以消除，而在发展中产生的新的进步的东西往往没有得到及时的应有的支持。
    苏联共产党中央委员会9月全体会议和随后几次全体会议的决议的重大意义首先在于：这些决议在深刻分析各方面生活的基础上，对于马克思列宁主义关于社会主义农业今后发展道路的学说作了创造性的发展。在这些决议中，党根据列宁的原则揭露出目前阻碍发挥社会主义制度优越性的一切东西，并且用有科学根据的迅速发展农业的计划把国家武装起来。
    在我国的发展过程中发生过并且以后还会发生许多需要加以研究、深入综合和解决的问题。我们的经济科学在这方面应该起很大的作用。我们不应当为了大大扩大农产品生产而不惜付出任何代价，而只应当在每个单位产品上付出最少的劳动和资金。关于各个农业生产部门在我国各个自然经济区域实行正确的、有科学根据的配置和专业化的问题，就是我们需要正确而且迅速予以解决的最重大的问题之一。
    为了合理地进行农业生产，必须在各个不同的地区种植和饲养那些在当地自然条件下可以获得最高的产品生产率的农作物和牲畜。同时还必须考虑到当地居民培育某些农作物和牲畜的经验。
    例如大家知道，在俄罗斯联邦西北部各州有着优越条件来生产亚麻、马铃薯以及在种植三叶草和增产玉蜀黍的基础上增产牛奶。然而在这些州里却缩减了长纤维亚麻、三叶草和马铃薯的播种，减低了牛奶产量，同时却扩大了在那里不能获得高产量的春小麦。克拉斯诺达边疆区有特别优越的条件在扩大玉蜀黍生产的基础上发展养猪业。
    有一些农业经济学家脱离了集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的日常实践，不从事具体的经济工作，不研究某些经济部门的经济效果，部分经济学家否认了价值规律在集体农庄中的作用，这些同志认为在集体农庄经济中不可能计算产品成本，必须用其他的指标来计算时间的节约因素。
    某些经济学家想把消耗在单位产品上的最少的社会必要劳动的原则列为考虑农业生产配置的最重要的因素，这一企图受到了指责。有人认为，集体农庄中没有成本这个范畴。所有这一切的后果就是：完全不去研究在集体农庄生产中计算生产费用、成本以及劳动生产率这样一些问题。
    这种理论的混乱促成了对于价格因素对农业发展过程的影响估计不足。最近，党中央委员会对许多农产品的征购和收购价格的现有水平作了巨大的改变，这些改变对加强集体农庄和集体农民在物质利益上关心发展个别作物和部门方面起了重大的积极作用。调整农产品价格的工作应当继续进行。许多农产品的价格是在生产条件同现在不同的情况下确定的。现在，农产品的价格有很多种（征购价格、收购价格、预购价格、付加金等等），某些农产品的价格和这些产品生产费用不相符合。某些农产品的价格比例应当根据生产单位产品的物资和劳动消耗量确定，这种价格比例将是发展某些农作物和农业部门的一个重要的刺激因素。
    应当消除经济科学落后的现象。应当要求农业经济学家认真研究各种作物和各个部门的生产的经济效果问题，研究降低集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的生产费用和降低它们所生产的农产品的成本的方法和措施，研究提高劳动生产率、农业生产专业化、农产品价格和农业用地的收益比较等问题。经济科学应当大力帮助党进行使机器拖拉机站过渡到经济核算制的工作。
    经济学家们应当研究和分析新农艺方法、新机器、植物品种和畜种的经济效果。有些已经出版的经济学家、农学家和机器操使者的作品（1946年出版的巴修克的“集体农庄的生产组织工作”、1953年出版的斯维尔歇夫斯基的“社会主义农业的机械化”、1955年出版的索科洛夫主编的“种植业基本知识”），毫无经济分析地一味宣传说，带穗作物完全直接由联合机来收获，是收获粮食的一种好方法。
    经济学的任务，就是要广泛地综合集体农庄和国营农场的成就和先进经验，以具体的单位为例提供合理进行农业生产的榜样。三
    在第十九次代表大会之后的时期中，党和政府遵循列宁关于民族问题的指示，采取了一系列措施来消除过分集中的现象，大大扩大了加盟共和国和自治共和国部长会议和各部的权力。这些都有助于提高地方机关在执行经济和文化建设任务中的创造性积极性和主动性。
    但是，应该直率地说，俄罗斯联邦部长会议和各部的活动积极性没有提高多少。在过去的州和边疆区的党代表会议上，俄罗斯联邦的共和国一级的各机关受到了极其尖锐的批评。
    在卡门斯克州的党代表会议上，俄罗斯联邦的农业部遭到批评，因为它对各州管理局工作的帮助和监督不够而且领导上存在着文牍主义和官僚主义作风。
    在普斯科夫州和加里宁格勒州的党代表会议上，尖锐批评俄罗斯联邦国营农场部，批评它对国营农场进行的领导工作不能令人满意。普斯科夫州“奥斯特罗夫”国营养禽场场长日内佐夫同志说，在最近时期，各种各样的指示不仅没有减少，反而增多了。在过去一年中，这一养禽场收到部里发来的书面指示和命令有1，897件，而其中大部分都是一些不必要的建议和意见。
    你们知道，现在俄罗斯联邦部长会议的领导是加强了，现在，俄罗斯联邦部长会议应当迅速和坚决地克服工作中所存在的缺点。
    应当说，赫鲁晓夫同志提出的关于成立苏共中央委员会俄罗斯联邦局的建议，是足以保证大大改善俄罗斯联邦各州状况的十分重大的措施。毫无疑问，这个建议将被批准和付诸实施。
    同志们！指示草案所规定的我国经济和文化建设的规模，使每一个苏联人以我们伟大的祖国而自豪，以社会主义经济制度的优越性而欢欣，对领导国家建设共产主义的共产党怀着无限感激的心情，并且使大家都想尽量更好地和更多地去做工作。
    我国人民充满创造力。他们在苏维埃制度建立的年代中，在共产党的领导下完成了不少伟大的、具有世界历史意义的任务，正因为这样，我们的国家现在成为和平、民主和社会主义的坚强堡垒。
    第二十次党代表大会的决议鼓舞着在亲爱的共产党的领导下的我国人民去为苏联人民和全体进步人类的幸福和快乐建立新的功勋。（掌声）（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科27日电）
