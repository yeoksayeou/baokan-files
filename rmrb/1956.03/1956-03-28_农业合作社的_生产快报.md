    Agricultural Cooperative’s “Production Bulletin”
    During the intense spring plowing season, the Shunjiang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shidong Township, Neijiang County, Sichuan Province, started publishing an irregular mimeographed newspaper called "Production Bulletin." The bulletin has already been published three times, with each issue promptly distributed to the production teams and production groups in the fields, encouraging them to comprehensively improve production levels.
    The Shunjiang Agricultural Production Cooperative has fifteen production teams and forty-two production groups. Because they originally belonged to several agricultural production cooperatives with different foundations, their production levels varied greatly. Therefore, after the merger, the leadership of the cooperative found it difficult to guide their production. To overcome this difficulty and enable the less advanced to catch up with the advanced, the cooperative started printing the "Production Bulletin" from late February. The 37th Production Group did not earnestly implement measures to increase production, such as land preparation, in early February, and more than a dozen laborers in the group were idle. In late February, the bulletin introduced the methods and achievements of some production teams and groups in implementing various production-increasing measures during the current spring plowing season. After discussion, the 37th Production Group expressed that they would break with the old farming habits and learn from the advanced. The entire group turned out to work, and even women who previously did not work in the fields came out to work.

### 农业合作社的“生产快报”

    农业合作社的“生产快报”
    在紧张的春耕生产的日子里，四川省内江县史东乡顺江农业生产合作社办了一种不定期的油印报纸“生产快报”。快报已经发刊三期，每期都及时散发到田间的各生产队和生产组里。鼓动它们全面提高生产水平。
    顺江农业生产合作社有十五个生产队、四十二个生产组。因为它们原来属于基础不同的几个农业生产合作社，生产水平相差较大，所以并社后社里领导它们生产感到了困难。为了克服这种困难，让落后的赶上先进的，从二月下旬起社里就编印了“生产快报”。第三十七生产小组在二月上旬没有认真贯彻土地加工等增产措施，全组有十多个劳动力闲着。二月下旬快报上介绍了部分生产队、组在当前春耕生产中贯彻各项增产措施的办法和成绩。第三十七生产小组讨论以后，表示要打破老一套的耕作习惯，向先进者看齐。全组全部出勤，连过去一向不下地的妇女也出来做活了。
