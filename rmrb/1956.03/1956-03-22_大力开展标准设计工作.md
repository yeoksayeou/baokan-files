    Vigorously Develop Standard Design Work
    In 1956, the total workload of capital construction in our country will increase by more than 60% compared to 1955; some projects originally scheduled for construction during the Second Five-Year Plan will be brought forward to begin preparation and construction in 1957; and the scale of industrial construction in the Second Five-Year Plan will be even larger than that of the First Five-Year Plan. These circumstances all require us to fundamentally improve capital construction work, starting with design work.
    The current situation faced by design institutions is: on the one hand, design capacity is insufficient, and design cannot keep up with the needs of construction; on the other hand, design tasks are constantly increasing, and the design progress must also be accelerated. Therefore, a series of measures must be taken to strive to change this passive state of design work within two to three years. Past experience has proven that among the various measures to improve design work, one of the most basic and effective is to widely compile and adopt standard designs and to repeatedly use more economical and reasonable individual designs in large quantities. This can greatly shorten design time, save design resources, and submit ready-made design documents as soon as possible.
    Our country currently has the conditions to vigorously develop standard design work. As early as 1951, we began standard design work for residential and civil construction. In the first three years of the First Five-Year Plan, the proportion of residential and civil construction using standard designs increased year by year. In the Northeast region, the residential and dormitory buildings constructed using standard designs and partially reused individual designs accounted for 75% of the entire region in 1953 and 88% in 1954. The adoption of standard designs and the reuse of designs in industrial construction has also increased year by year since 1953. According to incomplete statistics from eight central industrial ministries, nearly 1,200 standard designs for industrial transportation were designed by the end of 1954. This means that we have accumulated some experience in standard design work. Many design personnel have grown professionally through several years of training, and some design institutions have begun to be able to design complete standard designs for industrial enterprises. For example, the Building Materials Industry Design Institute of the Ministry of Heavy Industry has begun to design a standard design for a cement plant with an annual output of 450,000 tons and plans to submit a preliminary design in the first quarter of this year. In addition, some designs have stood the test of construction and have proven to be relatively excellent, and can be improved to become standard designs. Furthermore, we have Soviet experts guiding our design work and have accumulated a certain amount of Soviet and domestic materials related to standard design. These are all favorable conditions for us to vigorously develop standard design work.
    However, the current development of standard design work in our country is far from meeting the needs of construction. This is primarily because in the past, there was insufficient recognition of the importance of standard design work and its role in capital construction, so this aspect of work was not effectively strengthened. On the contrary, some units to some extent inappropriately juxtaposed the tasks of standard design and individual design, reduced the workload of standard design, or even simply did not do standard design, believing that doing standard design would hinder the completion of individual design plans. In fact, the opposite is true: the more demanding the individual design tasks are, the more compiling standard designs can greatly reduce the design workload. Many design institutions did not transfer experienced design personnel to compile standard designs, but instead transferred some inexperienced technical personnel to do this work, calling it "training." This to some extent prompted some design personnel to despise standard design, which resulted in lowering the quality of standard designs and affecting the compilation and promotion of standard designs. Some departments excessively emphasized the particularity of their departments, low technical level, or lack of information, which also affected the adoption and promotion of standard designs.
    Secondly, the standard design plan is unsound, and a formal standard design plan has not been established in the past three years. Although some units have compiled plans, most of them have not been reviewed and approved, have no binding force, and are not subject to any criticism or censure if they are not completed. Some units regard standard design as a way to solve the problem of design personnel being idle, and do not list it as part of the national design plan that must be completed. Due to the lack of a unified national standard design plan, some standard design tasks are often duplicated between departments, and even between design institutes within a department. The 1956 standard design plan has made greater progress, and initially proposed 538 standard design items for industry, transportation, agriculture, and civil use in 1956, which shows that various departments have begun to attach importance to standard design. However, from the perspective of the needs of construction tasks, the workload of standard design is clearly still far from sufficient.
    Thirdly, there is a lack of necessary organizational measures to ensure the strengthening of standard design work. At present, from the formulation of plans, the assignment of tasks, to the compilation, review, and promotion of design documents, there is still a lack of systematic and sound institutions to manage comprehensively. Some necessary design quotas and technical specifications have not yet been promulgated, and some necessary systems and regulations for compiling standard designs have not been formulated, which makes the compilation of standard designs lack the necessary basis.
    In order to ensure the smooth development of standard design work, the following measures must be taken:
    First, relevant departments should, on the basis of the overall balance of construction speed, design document submission progress, design tasks, and design resources, urge design institutions to actively formulate plans for compiling and adopting standard designs in the next two to three years; at the same time, they should increase new projects and modify the 1956 standard design plan in accordance with the spirit of vigorously developing standard design work.
    Second, various departments should quickly establish, improve, or adjust existing design and management institutions according to the size of the standard design tasks and the complexity of managing and approving tasks. The technical strength of some major design institutions is relatively strong, and they should do as much standard design as possible. At the same time, in order to make the technical force more concentrated and facilitate the guidance of Soviet experts, it is also necessary to rationally concentrate some manpower for standard design.
    Third, actively create conditions for compiling standard designs. Design institutions and scientific research institutions should formulate design quotas and technical specifications, budget quotas, and building material standards as soon as possible, and strive to compile the main necessary technical documents within a relatively short period of time. To do this work well, it is necessary to fully cooperate and collaborate, rationally divide labor, and resolutely overcome the current phenomena of no one being responsible, being constrained, and being hesitant to move forward.
    In the next two to three years, before a large number of standard designs have been compiled, the large-scale reuse of designs has special and important practical significance for accelerating the speed of construction, saving design resources, and striving to deliver design documents as soon as possible. Especially this year, if designs can be reused more often, it will free up a certain amount of design resources and time for compiling standard designs. Therefore, all units should share resources and quickly exchange standard design and reused design documents.

### 大力开展标准设计工作

    大力开展标准设计工作
    1956年我国基本建设的工作总量比1955年增加60％以上；原来预定在第二个五年计划中进行建设的一些项目将被提前至1957年开始准备和建设；而第二个五年计划中工业建设的规模还比第一个五年计划庞大得多。这些情况，都要求我们从根本上改善基本建设工作，首先是设计工作。
    各设计机构现在面临的情况是：一方面设计力量不足，设计赶不上建设的需要，另一方面设计任务又不断增加，设计进度也必须提前。因此必须采取一系列的措施，力争在两三年之内改变设计工作的这种被动状况。过去的经验证明，在改善设计工作的各种措施中，最基本的和见效最快的措施之一是广泛地编制和采用标准设计，大量地重复使用比较经济合理的单独设计。这样就可以大大地缩短设计时间，节省设计力量，及早提交现成的设计文件。
    我国目前已具备了大力开展标准设计工作的条件。早在1951年，我们就开始了住宅民用建设的标准设计工作。在第一个五年计划的前三年中，住宅民用建设采用标准设计的比例逐年都有提高，东北地区1953年采用标准设计和部分重复使用单独设计建设的住宅宿舍占全区的75％，1954年占88％。工业建设采用标准设计和重复使用设计从1953年以来，也逐年有所提高，根据中央八个工业部不完全的统计，到1954年末已设计出工业交通运输的标准设计近一千二百项。这就是说，我们在标准设计工作方面已经积累了一些经验。有许多设计人员经过几年的锻炼，业务上已成长起来，有的设计机构已开始能设计成套的工业企业的标准设计。如重工业部建筑材料工业设计院已开始设计年产四十五万吨水泥厂的标准设计，计划今年第一季度提交初步设计。此外，有些设计经过建设的考验，证明是比较优秀的，如加以提高也可成为标准设计。再加以我们在设计工作中有苏联专家指导，并且积累了一定数量的苏联和国内有关标准设计的资料。这些都是我们大力开展标准设计工作的有利条件。
    但是，目前我国标准设计工作的开展还远远不能适应建设的需要。这首先是因为过去对标准设计工作的重要性及其在基本建设中所起的作用认识不足，因此没有有效地加强这方面的工作。相反地，有些单位却在某种程度上把标准设计的任务和单独设计的任务不恰当地对立起来，减少标准设计的工作量，甚至干脆不做标准设计，认为做了标准设计就会妨碍单独设计计划的完成。实际上恰恰相反，越是在单独设计任务繁重的情况下，编制标准设计，就越能大大地减轻设计任务。许多设计机构没有把有经验的设计人员调去编制标准设计，却把一些缺乏经验的技术人员调去作这项工作，名之为“练兵”。这就在某种程度上促使一些设计人员轻视标准设计，结果降低了标准设计的质量，影响了标准设计的编制和推广。有的部门过多地强调本部门的特殊性、技术水平低或资料缺乏等客观困难，也影响了标准设计的采用和推广。
    其次是标准设计计划不健全，正规的标准设计计划在过去三年中还没有建立起来。有的单位虽然编制了计划，但大都未经审核批准，没有一定的约束力，完不成不受任何批评和指摘。有的单位把标准设计作为解决设计人员窝工的一种方法，而没有把它列为国家必需完成的设计计划的一部分。由于没有国家统一的标准设计计划，部与部之间，甚至一个部的各设计院之间，某些标准设计任务常常彼此重复。1956年度的标准设计计划有了较大进步，初步提出了1956年度工业、交通运输、农业和民用标准设计538项，这表明各部门已开始重视标准设计。但是，从建设任务的需要来看，标准设计的工作量显然还是十分不够的。
    再次，就是缺乏必要的组织措施来保证加强标准设计的工作。目前，从计划的制定，任务的下达，到设计文件的编制、审核和推广，还缺乏系统的健全的机构来通盘管理。一些必要的设计定额和技术规范还没有颁发，编制标准设计的一些必要的制度、章则也没有制定，这就使编制标准设计缺乏必要的依据。
    为使标准设计工作顺利地开展，必须采取下列措施：
    第一、各有关部门应该在建设速度、设计文件提交进度、设计任务和设计力量的总平衡的基础上，督促各设计机构积极制定近两三年编制和采用标准设计的规划；同时应该根据大力开展标准设计工作的精神增加新的项目，修改1956年度的标准设计计划。
    第二、各部门应该根据标准设计任务的大小，管理和审批任务的繁简，迅速建立、健全或调整现有的设计机构和管理机构。一些主要设计机构的技术力量较强，应尽量多做些标准设计。同时，为了使技术力量比较集中，便于苏联专家的指导，还必须合理地集中一些作标准设计的人力。
    第三、积极地为编制标准设计创造条件。各设计机构和科学研究机构应该尽速制定设计定额和技术规范、预算定额和建筑材料标准，并争取在较短的期间内把主要的必需的技术文件编制出来。要作好这项工作，就必须充分地配合协作，合理地分工，坚决克服目前存在的无人负责、束手束脚、举足不前的现象。
    在近两三年内，当大批的标准设计还没有编出以前，大量地重复使用设计，对加快建设速度、节省设计力量、争取及早交付设计文件具有特殊重要的现实意义，特别是在今年内，如果能多多重复地使用设计，更能为编制标准设计腾出一定的设计力量和时间。因此，各单位应该互通有无，迅速交流标准设计和重复使用的设计文件。
