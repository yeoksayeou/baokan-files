Grow Double-Season Rice More and Better

By Our Correspondent Gao Changren

Hunan Province's main measure to increase agricultural production this year is to expand the planting area of double-season rice from more than 5 million mu to more than 12 million mu, which is almost a quarter of the province's more than 46 million mu of paddy fields. In the production plans of the province's more than 80,000 agricultural production cooperatives, the planting of double-season rice is given top priority. The production-increasing measures taken by each cooperative, such as repairing water conservancy facilities, accumulating fertilizer, and adopting new farming techniques, are all centered on ensuring the completion of the double-season rice production increase task. According to current statistics, the planned area for planting double-season rice in various regions has already exceeded the target set by the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

Farmers in Xiangtan and Changde prefectures of Hunan Province originally had the habit of planting double-season rice. Before liberation, the province planted double-season rice on approximately 2 million mu of paddy fields annually. Due to various limitations, the average yield per mu was only about 500 jin. After liberation, the farmers' experience in planting double-season rice received attention from the People's Government. At the Hunan Provincial Model Workers Conference in 1951, Li Chenggui, a model worker from Liling County, and Tian Qifa, a model worker from Nan County, introduced their experiences in increasing production by planting double-season rice. From that time on, the agricultural departments of Hunan Province began to study and summarize the experience of planting double-season rice and gradually promoted it. In 1952, the planting area of double-season rice in the province reached 2.8 million mu, in 1953 it reached 3.23 million mu, in 1954 it reached 3.81 million mu, and in 1955 it reached more than 5.3 million mu. In 1955, not only Xiangtan and Changde prefectures planted large areas of double-season rice, but also the mountainous and hilly areas of western and southern Hunan, which had not previously had the habit of planting double-season rice, planted double-season rice as a key effort and achieved a bumper harvest. According to the statistics for 1955, the average yield per mu of single-season rice in Hunan Province was more than 400 jin, while the average yield per mu of double-season rice was more than 620 jin. The No. 1 Agricultural Production Cooperative of Hejiaqiao Township in Liling County achieved 1,608 jin per mu on its five mu of intercropped double-season rice, and yields of more than 1,000 jin per mu also appeared in western and southern Hunan.

Planting double-season rice requires good water conservancy conditions, a large amount of fertilizer, and more labor. However, in the past four years, the individual economy has been dominant in rural Hunan (by the spring of 1955, the number of farm households joining cooperatives accounted for only 3.3% of the total number of farm households). Due to difficulties in manpower, materials, and financial resources, the planting area of double-season rice was greatly limited. Now, the number of farm households joining cooperatives in Hunan Province accounts for 68% of the total number of farm households. The cooperatives implement unified management, which can smoothly solve the problems that must be solved for expanding the planting of double-season rice, such as water conservancy, fertilizer, and labor. Therefore, it is only this year that it has been possible to expand the planting area of double-season rice on an unprecedented scale. Half of the double-season rice planted in Hunan in the past was intercropped. This year, most of the double-season rice fields will implement continuous cropping. The yield per mu of continuous double-season rice is about 100 to 200 jin more than that of intercropped double-season rice. Although continuous cropping is more complex than intercropping in terms of farming techniques, advanced areas have summarized a set of successful experiences over the past few years, and efforts to promote various advanced experiences can solve the technical problems in continuous cropping.

As early as last winter, the broad masses of farmers in Hunan Province actively prepared for the large-scale expansion of double-season rice planting this year. The large-scale farmland water conservancy projects were started earliest. To date, the Dongting Lake renovation project, which guarantees 6 million mu of good farmland, has long been completed. More than 700,000 small farmland water conservancy projects in the province were basically completed by the end of February, which can increase the irrigated area by more than 500,000 mu and improve the water conservancy conditions of more than 13 million mu of land, of which the irrigated area of more than 8 million mu of land can resist drought for more than 50 days.

Farmers throughout the province have accumulated more than 3 billion dan of various fertilizers, an increase of 40% over the whole of last year. The fertilizer needed for planting double-season rice this year is mainly solved by the natural fertilizer accumulated by the farmers themselves. In addition to this, supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels are actively transferring a portion of commercial fertilizer to meet the needs of agricultural production cooperatives in various regions.

The problem of double-season rice seeds, especially early rice seeds that are needed now, once encountered difficulties. In areas where double-season rice is newly planted, every cooperative needs to plant, and seeds are extremely scarce. Under the instructions of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the province's grain, agriculture, and transportation departments specially organized a seed transfer office in late January, which was responsible for transferring more than 10 million jin of early and late rice seeds from Xiangtan and Changde prefectures, which produce double-season rice, to counties in southern and western Hunan that lacked seeds. At present, large quantities of seeds are still being transferred continuously. Many townships and cooperatives that lacked seeds have also overcome the difficulties of seed shortage through mutual adjustment. In this way, the problem of seed shortage has now been basically solved.

Of course, to realize Hunan Province's plan to plant 12 million mu of double-season rice this year, arduous efforts are still needed. At present, there are still a few townships and cooperatives that have not done well in preparing water conservancy, fertilizer, and seeds. A large number of agricultural cooperatives have not yet put their business management on the right track. This situation needs to be changed as soon as possible.

In order to successfully complete this year's agricultural production increase task, the responsible persons of the Party committees at all levels in Hunan Province are going deep down to check the spring plowing preparation work, starting to rectify and consolidate agricultural cooperatives, and running technical training classes for cultivating double-season rice, so as to plant this year's double-season rice more and better.

    把双季稻种得又多又好
    本报记者　高长任
    湖南省今年在农业方面所采取的主要增产措施，是把双季稻的种植面积从五百多万亩扩大到1，200多万亩，几乎占全省4，600多万亩水稻田面积的四分之一。在全省八万多个农业生产合作社的生产计划中，都把种植双季稻摆在第一位；每个社所采取的增产措施，如修水利、积肥料、采用新的耕作技术，也都是围绕着保证完成双季稻增产任务进行的。据现在的统计，各地播种双季稻的计划，已经突破了中共湖南省委提出的上述指标。
    湖南省湘潭、常德两专区的农民，原来就有种植双季稻的习惯。解放以前，全省每年约有二百万亩水稻田种双季稻，由于种种条件的限制，每亩平均产量大约只有五百斤上下。解放以后，农民种植双季稻的经验受到人民政府的重视。在1951年湖南省召开的劳动模范大会上，醴陵县劳动模范李呈桂、南县劳动模范田启发介绍了种植双季稻增产的经验。从那时起，湖南省农业部门就着手研究、总结种植双季稻的经验，并且逐步加以推广。1952年，全省种植双季稻的面积达到280万亩，1953年达到323万亩，1954年达到381万亩，1955年达到530多万亩。在1955年，不仅湘潭、常德两个专区种植了大面积的双季稻，就是过去没有种植双季稻习惯的湘西、湘南山区和丘陵区也有重点地种植了双季稻，而且得到了丰收。据1955年的统计，湖南省单季稻的每亩平均产量是四百多斤，而双季稻每亩是620多斤。醴陵县的贺家桥乡的第一农业生产合作社的五亩间作双季稻，每亩达到1，608斤，在湘西、湘南也出现了每亩千斤以上的产量。
    种植双季稻需要良好的水利条件，需要大量的肥料和更多的劳动力。但是，过去四年，湖南农村一直是个体经济占优势（到1955年春，入社农户只占总农户的3.3％），由于人力物力财力等方面都有困难，种植双季稻的面积不能不受到很大限制。现在湖南省入社农户已经占总农户的68％，合作社实行统一经营，可以顺利解决水利、肥料、劳动力等扩种双季稻必需解决的问题。因此，今年才有可能空前地扩大双季稻的种植面积。湖南过去种植的双季稻有一半间作制，今年大部分双季稻田将推行连作制。连作双季稻比间作双季稻的每亩产量多一百斤到二百斤左右。虽然在耕作技术方面连作比间作更复杂一些；但是几年来，先进地区已经总结出了一套成功的经验，努力推广各种先进经验，是可以解决连作中的技术问题的。
    早在去年冬季，湖南省广大农民，就积极为今年的大面积扩种双季稻作准备。进行得最早的是大规模的农田水利工程，到现在为止，保障六百万亩良田的洞庭湖整修工程早就完工了。全省七十多万处小型农田水利工程在二月底已经基本完工，可以增加灌溉面积五十多万亩，改善1，300多万亩田的水利条件，其中有八百多万亩田的灌溉面积，可以抗旱五十天以上。
    全省农民已经积了各种肥料三十多亿担，比去年全年还增加40％。今年种双季稻所需要的肥料，主要靠农民自己积的自然肥料来解决；除这以外，各级供销合作社正在积极调运一部分商品肥料供各地农业生产合作社的需要。
    曾经一度发生困难的是双季稻的种子问题，特别是当前就需要的早稻种子。在新种双季稻的地区，社社要种，种子奇缺。在中共湖南省委指示下，省的粮食、农业、交通部门在一月下旬专门组织了一个种子调运办公室，负责从双季稻产区的湘潭、常德两个专区把一千多万斤早、晚稻种子调运到缺种的湘南、湘西各县。现在，大批种子仍在源源调运。不少缺种的乡、社，通过互相调剂，也克服了缺种困难。这样，缺种的问题，现在已经得到基本解决。
    当然，要使今年湖南省播种1，200万亩双季稻的计划实现，还需要作艰苦的努力。现在还有少数的乡、社在水利、肥料、种子等准备工作方面做的不好；还有一大部分农业合作社的经营管理没有走上轨道。这种情况需要尽快地加以改变。
    为了胜利完成今年的农业增产任务，湖南省各级党委负责人正在深入下去，检查春耕准备工作，着手整顿和巩固农业合作社，开办培育双季稻的技术训练班，以便把今年的双季稻种得又多又好。
