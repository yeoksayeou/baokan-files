    Commendable Behavior
    The socialist competition in Wuhan's Cosmic Cigarette Factory is proceeding intensely, but suddenly the main raw material – cigarette paper – is in short supply. The factory's supply and marketing department contacted the Materials Supply Bureau and the Hankou Port Authority multiple times, but they all said that the ship carrying the paper was grounded due to shallow water, and it was unknown when it could be transported. When they tried to borrow from Nanyang, Hankou, and other cigarette factories in the city, they also didn't have much paper in stock. Therefore, the comrades in the supply and marketing department traveled overnight to Changsha and Zhengzhou, and finally borrowed 1,300 reams of cigarette paper.
    After the borrowed cigarette paper was transported back, the Nanyang and Hankou cigarette factories also faced serious paper shortages. The comrades in the Cosmic Cigarette Factory's supply and marketing department thought: We can't just watch our brother factories stop production! So they shared two days' worth of their supply with them, just in time to bridge the gap until the cigarette paper shipped from Shanghai arrived.
    The comrades in the Cosmic Cigarette Factory's supply and marketing department tried every possible means to actively overcome difficulties. In particular, even when their own factory was facing difficulties, they were still able to strongly support brother factories. This spirit of selflessness, with the overall interests of the country always in mind, is worthy of emulation by all enterprise workers.

    值得表扬的行为
    武汉市宇宙烟厂的社会主义竞赛正在紧张地开展，忽然主要原料——卷纸供应不上了。厂里的供销课多次向物资供应局和汉口港务局联系，都说运纸的船因为水浅搁住了，不知道什么时候能运到。向本市南洋、汉口等烟厂去借，他们存的纸也不多了，于是，供销课的同志就连夜分途到长沙、郑州去，终于借到了1，300盘卷纸。
    借来的卷纸运到以后，南洋、汉口两烟厂缺纸的情况也严重了。宇宙烟厂供销课的同志想：不能看着兄弟烟厂停工呵！就分了两天的用量给他们，正好都接上了上海运来的卷纸。
    宇宙烟厂供销课的同志想尽一切办法，主动地克服困难，特别是在自己厂有困难的时候，仍能大力支援兄弟工厂。这种大公无私，处处以国家整体利益为念的精神，是值得所有企业工作人员学习的。
