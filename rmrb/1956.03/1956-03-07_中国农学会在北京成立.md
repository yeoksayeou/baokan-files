The representatives attending the meeting discussed and studied the "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) for 1956-1967" and the "12-Year Long-Range Plan for National Agricultural Scientific Research." Everyone agreed that the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences must give full play to the strength of its members, closely cooperate with the central work of relevant departments, and carry out academic activities and academic discussions in a planned manner. It must publish the "Journal of Agricultural Science" to promote academic research on crop selection, improved seed breeding, cultivation, and planting. It must also organize members to study the scientific achievements of the Soviet Union and other countries, summarize and improve the production experience of our farmers, and rapidly bring our agricultural science level up to the world's advanced level.

    中国农学会在北京成立
    中国农学会6日在北京正式成立。并于4日到6日召开了中国农学会第一届会员代表大会。会上通过了“中国农学会会章”，确定了中国农学会的方针任务和中心工作。并推选出中国农学会理事杨显东等39人。
    到会的代表讨论并研究了1956—1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）和全国农业科学研究12年远景规划。大家一致认为中国农学会必须充分发挥会员的力量，密切配合有关部门的中心工作，有计划地开展学术活动和学术讨论。出版“农业学报”，推进农作物的选种、良种繁育、耕作栽培等方面的学术研究工作；还必须组织会员学习苏联及其他国家科学成就，总结提高我国农民的生产经验，使我们的农业科学水平迅速赶上世界先进水平。
