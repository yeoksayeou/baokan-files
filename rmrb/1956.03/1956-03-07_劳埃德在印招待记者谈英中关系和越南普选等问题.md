Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 6th: British Foreign Secretary Lloyd held a press conference in Delhi on March 5th before departing for Karachi to attend the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) Council meeting.

At the conference, he said, "We recognize the People's Republic of China and believe that that government should participate in the United Nations. However, this view is met with fierce opposition from some within the United Nations." He continued, "Therefore, at times, one cannot help but wonder whether any effort aimed at strengthening this organization might instead weaken it, and for this reason, we have not sought to force a solution to this issue."

When a reporter asked why the United Kingdom's representative to the United Nations abstained from voting on the question of admitting the People's Republic of China, Lloyd did not reply, but merely said, "We have expressed our views in many ways, publicly or within the United Nations."

Regarding the possibility of holding early elections in Indochina, Lloyd said that the question to consider now is that the South and North Vietnamese governments should hold general elections throughout the region in accordance with the terms of the Geneva Accords. He said, "Our aim is to ensure that the terms of the agreement are implemented and to further enable free elections to be held nationwide." However, he did not mention what steps should be taken to enable such elections to be held, but merely said, "I don't think we should be impatient."

A reporter asked if he thought India would still be able to serve as chairman of the International Commission if the elections could not be held as scheduled in July this year. In response, Lloyd expressed the hope that India would continue to serve as chairman of the International Commission and continue to make very valuable contributions as it has done in the past.

In answering questions about military blocs in the Middle East and Far East, Lloyd tried hard to describe the purpose of military alliances like the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact as for "self-defense," attempting to prove that they are in accordance with the United Nations Charter.

He also spoke at the press conference about his negotiations with Indian Prime Minister Nehru. He emphasized that relations between Britain and India have always been normal, although he said he did not wish to hide or cover up the differences between the two countries. He believed that the "Kashmir issue" could not be discussed at the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council meeting and should be resolved through direct negotiations between the Indian and Pakistani governments.

    劳埃德在印招待记者谈英中关系和越南普选等问题
    新华社新德里6日电  英国外交大臣劳埃德在3月5日动身去喀喇蚩参加东南亚条约组织理事会会议以前，在德里举行了记者招待会。
    他在会上说：“我们承认中华人民共和国，并且认为那个政府应当参加联合国。但是，这种观点受到联合国内一部分人的激烈的反对。”他接下去说，“因此，有的时候，你不能不想一想，目的在于加强这个组织的任何努力是不是反而会削弱它，为了这个原因，我们没有设法强行解决这个问题。”
    有记者问到联合王国驻联合国的代表为什么在表决接纳中华人民共和国的问题的时候弃权，劳埃德没有答复，只是说：“我们已用许多方法，公开地或在联合国内，表示了我们的意见。”
    在谈到在印度支那早日举行选举的可能性问题的时候，劳埃德说，现在要考虑的问题是，南越和北越政府应当依照日内瓦协定的条款在整个地区举行普选。他说：“我们的目的是使得协定条款得到执行和进一步使自由选举在全国举行。”不过，他没有谈到要采取什么步骤来使这样的选举得以举行，只是说“我认为我们不应当没有耐心。”
    有记者问到，要是选举不能在今年7月如期举行，他是否认为印度仍然能够担任国际委员会主席。劳埃德在回答的时候表示希望印度能够继续担任国际委员会主席，而且继续像它过去那样地作出非常可贵的贡献。
    劳埃德在答复关于中东和远东的军事集团问题的时候，竭力把东南亚条约组织和巴格达条约那样的军事联盟的目的说成是为了“自卫”，企图证明它们是符合联合国宪章的。
    他在记者招待会上还谈到他同印度总理尼赫鲁谈判的情形。他强调说英国和印度两国的关系始终是正常的，虽然他表示并不希望掩饰或者遮盖两国之间的分歧。他认为“克什米尔问题”不能够在东南亚条约组织理事会会议上讨论，而应该通过印度和巴基斯坦两国政府的直接谈判寻求解决。
