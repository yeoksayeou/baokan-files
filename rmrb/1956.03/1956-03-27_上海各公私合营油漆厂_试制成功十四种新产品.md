Shanghai's various joint state-private oil paint factories under the Shanghai Paint and Pigment Industry Company have successfully trial-produced fourteen new products in the first quarter of this year.

    The joint state-private Yonggu Paint Factory has successfully trial-produced a type of "heat-sensitive color-changing paint." When painted on motors, machine bearings, and other machine transmission parts, it will automatically change color when the temperature rises to 70 degrees Celsius due to prolonged machine friction, warning people to shut down the machinery quickly to prevent accidents. The "electrical wire spray paint" successfully trial-produced by the joint state-private Yamei Paint Factory is difficult to burn when painted on electrical wires, and it will automatically extinguish if it catches fire. The newly trial-produced black smokestack paint for ships and boilers has a heat resistance of up to 600 degrees Fahrenheit. (Our correspondent in Shanghai)

    上海各公私合营油漆厂
    试制成功十四种新产品
    上海市造漆颜料工业公司所属各公私合营油漆厂，在今年第一季度内试制成功了十四种新产品。
    公私合营永固造漆厂试制成功的一种“遇热变色漆”，用来漆在马达、机器轴承等各种机器传动部分，当机器磨擦过久，热度升到七十度时，它就会自动变色，警告人们赶快关车，以防止发生事故。公私合营亚美造漆厂试制成功的“电线喷漆”，用它漆在电线上就不易燃烧，如果起火，也会自动熄灭。新试制成功的轮船、锅炉上用的黑烟囱漆，它的耐热度高达华氏六百度。　　（本报驻上海记者）
