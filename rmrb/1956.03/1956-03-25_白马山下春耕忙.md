    Spring Plowing is Busy at the Foot of White Horse Mountain
    Zhang Baoyi
    Leaving Jinan City and heading southwest a short distance, you reach White Horse Mountain.
    In the fields west of White Horse Mountain, members of the "East is Red" Agricultural Cooperative are using well water to irrigate their wheat. The waterwheels turn incessantly, and streams of clear water flow into the wheat fields along dug channels. In the distance, where well water cannot reach, youth shock brigades carry water by the bucket to irrigate. During their rest breaks, a woman in her twenties, wiping sweat from her brow with her rolled-up sleeves, happily reports to the female team leader that she has already carried twenty buckets of water. Twenty buckets an hour may not seem like much, but team leader Chen Xiufang tells me that she is still five buckets short of Zhang Jinju, the short girl who is only eighteen this year. The team leader, perhaps afraid that she might sound like the method of carrying water to irrigate is too clumsy and backward, then explains: "The hillside is far from the well, so we use people to carry water. The cooperative already has eighty waterwheels, and recently bought a new electric pump that can irrigate sixteen hundred mu of land." Male shock brigade leader Zhang Jinghai chimes in: "The cooperative's three thousand five hundred mu of wheat have just been fertilized with four thousand catties per mu. The wheat is full and is now waiting for water! Recently, we dug a large reservoir two li long and six meters wide, and sank more than forty new wells. We will irrigate all the wheat fields in the cooperative, some even several times."
    Approaching the crowd who are busy spring plowing, you can not only see their enthusiasm for intensive labor, but also that they have learned a lot of intercropping, interplanting, deep plowing, and careful cultivation techniques. This year, the more than nine hundred mu of spring land are all being interplanted, meticulously cultivated, weeded, and insect-controlled. All of the thousand mu of sweet potatoes planned for planting this year will implement the new method of intercropping sweet potatoes and corn. The ridges for planting spring sweet potatoes will also be exposed to the sun and fertilized in nests. Spring sweet potatoes will also be grown using the heated-bed seedling method, which can advance transplanting by half a month, and it is estimated that each mu can produce seventy-five hundred catties of sweet potatoes and two hundred catties of corn. Peas have also been interplanted in the eight hundred mu of wheat fields in a timely manner.
    In order to ensure the realization of this year's production increase plan, the members are also carrying out a hot and enthusiastic manure accumulation effort. No matter which production team you walk into, you will see piles and piles of fertilizer, with many people busy sunning, turning, and fermenting manure.
    Since last December, when more than a thousand households of farmers, distributed in ten natural villages at the foot of White Horse Mountain, formed the "East is Red" advanced cooperative, many things that were impossible in the past can now be done. In the past, the average annual yield per mu was only two or three hundred catties of grain, but this year it is planned to reach a thousand catties, and the members are confident. In the past, farmers here would go to the city to do odd jobs in the spring, and women did not participate in agricultural production at all. From last December to now, many male laborers have already worked a hundred workdays, and 80% of the women have also participated in field labor. Cucumbers, eggplants and other vegetables have begun to be planted after greenhouse seedling cultivation, and fresh vegetables will be eaten earlier this year.
    In the distant low-lying area, more than a hundred members are renovating nurseries, they will cultivate more seedlings themselves, plant trees and create forests, and green the White Horse Mountain.

    白马山下春耕忙
    张保义
    出了济南市，向西南走不远，就到了白马山。
    在白马山西边的田里，东方红农业合作社的社员们，正在利用井水浇麦。水车不停地转动着，一股股清水顺着刨开的渠道，涌入麦田；远处，井水浇不到的地方，青年突击队员们就一担一担地挑水去浇。在他们休息的空隙里，一个二十来岁的女人，用卷起的布衫袖子擦了擦头上的汗，快活地向女队长报告，她已经挑了二十担水。一个钟头挑二十担水，说来确实不算少，可是，队长陈秀芳告诉我：她比起那个今年才十八岁的矮个子姑娘张金菊，还差五担呢。队长大概怕说挑水浇麦的办法太笨太落后，接着解释说：“山坡地离井远，才用人挑水浇。社里已经有八十多架水车，最近还新买了一部能浇一千六百亩地的电力抽水机。”男突击队长张敬海插嘴说：“社里三千五百亩麦子，每亩刚施了四千斤肥料，麦子吃饱啦，还等喝水呢！最近才挖好了一个二里路长、六公尺宽的大水库，新打四十多眼井，我们要把社里所有的麦田都浇水，有的还要浇几遍。”
    走近正在春耕整地的人群里，不仅可以看到他们紧张劳动的热情，还可以看到他们已学会了很多间种套作、深耕细作的农田技术。如今年的九百多亩春地，全部实行了套耕、细耕、拾草和除虫；今年计划栽种的一千亩甘薯，全部实行甘薯玉米间作的新办法。种春甘薯的土埂，并采取日光曝晒、施窝肥等措施。春甘薯还要实行火炕育苗法，能提前半月插秧，预计每亩能产甘薯七千五百斤，玉米二百斤；八百多亩的麦田里也适时地套种上了豌豆。
    社员们为了保证今年的增产计划实现，还进行了热火朝天的积肥工作。不管走进那个生产队里，都会看到一大堆一大堆的肥料，许多人在忙着晒粪、翻倒、发酵。
    自从去年十二月间，分布在白马山下的十个自然村的一千多户农民组成了东方红高级社后，许多过去根本办不到的事情，现在都可以办了。过去每亩常年产量只二、三百斤粮，今年计划达到一千斤，社员都感到有把握。过去这里的农民一到春天，就到城里去干零工去了，妇女根本不参加农业生产。从去年十二月到现在，已经有不少的男劳动力干了一百个工日了，有80％的妇女也参加田间劳动。黄瓜、茄子等蔬菜经过温室育苗，已开始种植，今年将要提前吃到新鲜的蔬菜。
    远远的洼地里，有一百多社员正在修整苗圃，他们要自己培育更多的树苗，植树造林，把白马山绿化起来。
