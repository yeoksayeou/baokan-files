    Solving Problems in Agricultural Cooperative Construction
    Zhang Chunfan, Deputy Secretary of the Hebei Township Branch of the Xicun District Committee in Yichun County, Jiangxi Province, while inspecting the spring plowing preparations of the newly established four agricultural production cooperatives, discovered that the enthusiasm of the members, especially the poor peasant members, was not high. Out of 132 laborers in the four cooperatives, 41 had abandoned agricultural production to dig coal mines. Why wasn't the collective production enthusiasm of the members high? It turned out that the land remuneration stipulated by these four cooperatives was too high, generally accounting for 42% of the output upon joining the cooperative; the share fund burden was unreasonable, with the money for draft cattle valued as shares being borne by the farmland, more than 4 yuan per mu; and the money for farm implements valued as shares being borne by the labor force, with each laborer bearing 23 to 27 yuan. According to these regulations, poor peasants would obviously suffer.
    After identifying the reasons, these four cooperatives respectively convened meetings of Party members and Communist Youth League members, cooperative committee meetings, and member representative meetings to further study the draft model charter of agricultural cooperatives and referred to the experience of the old cooperatives, reducing land remuneration to 35% of the output upon joining the cooperative, and also appropriately revising the original method of valuing draft cattle and farm implements as shares. After resolving these problems, the production enthusiasm of the members of the four cooperatives was improved. Each cooperative inspected the spring plowing preparations, formulated the cooperative's production plan, and carried out work such as accumulating fertilizer and building water conservancy projects.

    解决建社中的问题
    江西省宜春县西村区河北乡支部副书记张春凡在检查新建的4个农业生产合作社春耕准备工作的时候，发现社员尤其是贫农社员生产积极性不高，4个社132个劳动力有41个人丢掉农业生产去挖煤井。社员的集体生产积极性为什么不高呢？原来是这4个社规定的土地报酬太高，一般的占入社产量42％；股份基金负担的不合理，耕牛作价入社的钱归田亩负担，每亩4元多；农具作价入社的钱归劳动力负担，每个劳动力负担23元至27元。根据这些规定，贫农显然要吃亏。
    找出原因以后，这4个社就分别召开了党员团员会、社委会和社员大会，进一步学习了农业合作社示范章程草案，参考了老社的经验，把土地报酬降低为入社产量的35％，把原来耕牛、农具作价入社的办法也作了适当的修改。解决了这些问题，4个社的社员的生产积极性提高了，各社都检查了春耕准备情况，订出了社的生产计划，开展了积肥和兴修水利等工作。
