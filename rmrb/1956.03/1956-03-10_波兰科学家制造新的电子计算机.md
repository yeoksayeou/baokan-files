Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 9th -- According to a Polish Press Agency report on the 8th, Polish scientists have manufactured new electronic computers. Three electronic computers are already working in the Mathematical Machines Department of the Mathematical Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Among these three computers, one is a differential equation analyzer, one is an algebraic polynomial analyzer, and one is an algebraic linear equation analyzer. The Mathematical Institute has established a special calculation unit to help scientific institutions and industrial enterprises solve difficult numerical problems. This will save a lot of labor and time. For example, with the help of an electronic computer, 132 complex algebraic equations were solved in 30 hours, whereas it would normally take about 700 hours to solve these equations.

    The Mathematical Machines Department is now manufacturing an electronic partial differential equation integrating machine. This machine has many features that foreign machines of this type do not yet have. This machine will begin work this spring and will be used specifically to solve mathematical problems related to the theory of elasticity, the theory of electric fields, and fluid mechanics.

    At the same time, Poland is studying other electronic machines. Preparations are now underway to begin continuous production of certain electronic machines starting in 1957.

    波兰科学家制造新的电子计算机
    新华社华沙9日电　据波兰通讯社8日报道：波兰科学家制造了新的电子计算机。3架电子计算机已经在华沙波兰科学院数学研究所数学机器部进行工作。这3架计算机当中有一架是微分方程解析机，一架是代数多项式解析机，一架是代数线性方程解析机。数学研究所建立了一个特别计算单位，帮助科学机关和工业企业解决困难的数字问题。这样就可以节省大量的劳动和时间。例如，在一架电子计算机的帮助下，132个复杂的代数方程式在30个小时里就解决了，而通常解决这些方程式大约需要700小时。
    数学机器部现在正在制造一架偏微分方程电子积分机。这架机器具有外国的这类机器到现在为止还没有的许多特点。这架机器将在今年春季开始用来进行工作，它将特别用来解决有关弹性理论、电场理论和流体力学的数学问题。
    同时，波兰正在研究其他电子机器。现在正在准备从1957年起开始连续生产某些电子机器。
