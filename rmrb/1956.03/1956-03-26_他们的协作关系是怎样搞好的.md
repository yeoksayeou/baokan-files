How Their Collaboration Was Improved
By our reporter Cao Baoming

In the construction of the Wuhan Meat Joint Processing Plant's new project, the collaboration between the Wuhan Meat Joint Processing Plant's Capital Construction Department (referred to as Party A) and the Eighth Engineering Department of the Central South Engineering Administration Bureau (referred to as Party B) was relatively good. Initially, Party A lacked experience and planned an eighteen-month construction period for the main plant building, which could be completed in twelve to fourteen months. They also scheduled the construction of roads, sewers, and office buildings for the later stages of the project, which would have resulted in a total project duration of one year and nine months. Party B took the initiative to offer suggestions, shortening the construction period for the main plant building and bringing forward the construction of roads, sewers, and other infrastructure. This shortened the overall project duration by three months and saved the cost of building temporary roads. Later, when Party A's superiors proposed a plan to further shorten the construction period, Party B actively overcame various difficulties and worked hard to realize this plan. Despite its own limited technical resources, Party B also sent two technicians to help Party A prepare the project budget and five designers to replace Party A in preparing the construction organization design. During construction, Party B also gave much consideration to Party A, saving expenses. Originally, Party A planned to move thousands of cubic meters of laid gravel, sand, and timber. Party B proactively suggested not moving them, saving more than 3,000 yuan in transportation costs. When lower-level cadres requested Party A to supply ten searchlights, Party B leaders also proactively reduced the plan to four.

When the project started ahead of schedule, there was a shortage of materials, and Party B's materials section was weak. Party A actively helped Party B find materials. The main plant building's foundation project was short eight hundred tons of slag cement and three thousand cubic meters of gravel. Party A sent the head of the materials section and several staff members to run around the city for several days. They borrowed cement from the Hankou Flood Diversion Project and transported gravel from Huangshi City, ensuring that the project started on time. Party B's technical inspection capabilities were weak, so Party A collaborated with Party B to establish a technical inspection team to promptly check and correct situations where the spacing of steel bars and the spacing between upper and lower mesh did not conform to the drawings. Party A also lent Party B broadcasting equipment and loudspeakers to help Party B carry out on-site publicity.

The responsible comrades of the Party committees of both sides jointly studied the issue of how to strengthen collaboration. Before the start of each project, technical briefings were held, with personnel from both sides participating to understand the situation and work together. The security work on the construction site was also carried out in coordination by both sides. Last December, when pouring the foundation of the main plant building continuously for nine days and nights, a large amount of gravel was needed. Washing the gravel could not be done in time. Both sides mobilized people to participate in the labor and wash the gravel in time.

Their relationship in improving the collaboration was not always smooth sailing. Initially, some staff members of Party B emphasized that the conditions created by Party A for construction were poor, saying, "How can we do the job?" Some staff members of Party A emphasized that Party B's work was chaotic, saying, "We help them, but they do not make progress." These staff members were keen to haggle over "responsibility": "This is Party B's responsibility, we don't care." "This is Party A's responsibility, we don't care." For a new construction project, the strength of both sides is very weak. If they continue to haggle like this, many tasks cannot be carried out. Therefore, the leaders of both sides, one after another, criticized this departmentalism in Party branch secretary meetings, branch committee enlarged meetings, and other various meetings, repeatedly educating cadres to recognize that doing a good job in project construction is the common responsibility of both Party A and Party B, and establishing the idea of proactive collaboration, unity, and mutual assistance. The leaders of both sides set an example by taking the initiative to discuss matters. They personally urged their subordinates to help each other's work, and only then was a better collaborative relationship established.

In January of this year, two more problems occurred in the work: one was that a quality accident occurred in the project, and Party B did not seriously deal with the dereliction of duty of personnel, which Party A had opinions on; the other was that Party A did not supply drawings in a timely manner, and there was a phenomenon of backlog of drawings, which affected the construction preparation work, which Party B had opinions on. In addition, when dealing with these problems, because there were shortcomings in each other's thinking and style, the leaders of both sides also had some opinions. This caused confusion in the thinking of cadres. Some staff members of Party A thought: "They (Party B) do not pay attention to quality at all, we have to rectify them properly." Some staff members of Party B thought: "They (Party A) cannot supply drawings in a timely manner, they are responsible for the delay." At this time, the Party Secretary of Party B's superior, the Central South Engineering Administration Bureau, personally went to the construction site to find the responsible comrades of both sides to study, hoping that they would continue to give play to the spirit of proactive collaboration, and that no individualism would be allowed in the collaboration. Party A leaders also conducted education among cadres, especially criticizing the wrong attitude of simply blaming Party B for the project quality problem, and proposed that both Party A and Party B are responsible for the project quality, and required Party A staff to not only discover problems at any time in supervising the project quality in the future, but also to help Party B solve problems in good faith. Party B leaders also educated cadres to actively overcome difficulties and work with Party A to do a good job in project construction. Both sides also jointly invited Soviet experts to inspect the project quality, remedied the poor quality foundation of the main plant building, and decided to establish a technical meeting attended by technical personnel from both sides to strengthen the guarantee and supervision of the project quality.

The technical meeting has been held twenty-five times, and the effect is very good. In the past, because the on-site work was chaotic, Party A's technical personnel found that there were project quality problems, but could not find the specific person in charge, and were very anxious. Party B's workers also reflected: "There are too many clues, who should we listen to?" After the technical meeting, Party A promptly raised some problems that could not be solved on the site at the meeting, and Party B was responsible for solving them. For example, there are pipes in the rubble concrete wall of the compressor workshop. Party B originally planned to bury the bare pipes. Party A believed that this wall would play a moisture-proof role in the future, and burying the bare pipes would affect the project quality, so they suggested at the meeting that Party B wrap the pipes with felt.

Recently, they also decided to establish a three-party drawing review system (Party A, Party B, and the design department) and a system for formulating collaboration plans on a quarterly and monthly basis, and decided that Party A would send people to participate in Party B's ten-day and monthly plan inspection meetings to strengthen collaboration.

The new construction project of the Wuhan Meat Joint Processing Plant has not been launched for a long time, and many problems will occur in the future. Therefore, both sides must actively improve their work, quickly change the busy and chaotic situation caused by the early start of the project, and put the work on the right track; especially need to strengthen political work, and further establish the overall concept.

    他们的协作关系是怎样搞好的
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    在武汉肉类联合加工厂的新建工程中，武汉肉类联合加工厂基建处（简称甲方）和中南工程管理局第八工程处（简称乙方）的协作关系是比较好的。最初，甲方缺乏经验，在计划中把只需十二到十四个月可以建成的主厂房订为十八个月，把道路、上下水道和办公楼等列在工程后期，这样完成全部工程就得一年九个月。乙方主动提出意见，把主厂房工期缩短，把道路、上下水道等也提前修建，这样就把全部工程的工期缩短了三个月，还可以节省修建临时道路的费用。后来，甲方的上级提出再度缩短工期的计划，乙方也积极克服各种困难，为实现这个计划而努力。在乙方本身技术力量不足的情况下，乙方还派了两名技术员帮助甲方编制工程预算，派五名设计员代替甲方编制施工组织设计。施工中，乙方也多为甲方考虑，节约开支。原来甲方计划把已经放好的数千立方公尺石子、砂和木材搬动，乙方主动建议不要搬动，省下了三千多元的搬运费。下面的干部要求甲方供给十个探照灯，乙方领导人也主动把计划削减为四个。
    工程提前开工，材料不足，乙方材料科力量又薄弱，甲方就积极帮助乙方找材料。主厂房的基础工程缺矿渣水泥八百吨和石子三千立方公尺，甲方派了材料科长和几名工作人员在市内跑了几天，才从汉口分洪工程借来了水泥，从黄石市运来了石子，使工程按期开工。乙方技术检查的力量薄弱，甲方就协同乙方成立技术检查组，及时检查出钢筋间距和上下网间距不符合图纸的情况，及时加以纠正。甲方还借给乙方广播机和喇叭，帮助乙方展开工地宣传。
    双方的党委负责同志共同研究了如何加强协作的问题。每项工程开工前进行技术交底，双方的人员都参加，互相了解情况，协同工作。工地的保卫工作，也由双方配合进行。去年十二月连续九昼夜浇灌主厂房基础的时候，需要大量的石子，洗石工作来不及，双方都动员人去参加劳动，把石子及时清洗出来。
    他们搞好双方协作的关系，并不是一帆风顺的。最初，乙方有些工作人员强调甲方为施工创造的条件差，“我们怎么干？”甲方有些工作人员强调乙方工作乱，“我们帮助他们，他们就不进步。”这些工作人员都爱计较“责任”：“这是乙方的责任，我们不管。”“这是甲方的责任，我们不管。”对一个新建工程来说，双方的力量都很弱，如果这样计较下去，许多工作都没法进行。因此，双方领导人员都先后在党的支部书记会议、支委扩大会议和其他各种会上，批判了这种本位主义思想，反复教育干部认识搞好工程建设是甲乙双方共同的责任，树立主动协作，团结互助的思想。双方领导人员以身作则，有事主动商量。并亲自督促所属工作人员帮助对方工作，才建立起较好的协作关系。
    今年一月，工作中又发生两个问题：一个是工程出了质量事故，乙方对失职人员没有严肃处理，甲方有意见；一个是甲方没及时供应图纸，并且有积压图纸的现象，影响施工准备工作，乙方有意见。加上在处理这些问题的时候，因为彼此思想、作风上有缺点，双方领导人员也有些意见。这就在干部思想中引起混乱。甲方有的工作人员就认为：“他们（乙方）根本不重视质量，得好好整他们一下。”乙方有的工作人员认为：“他们（甲方）图纸不能及时供应，拖了时间他们负责。”这时候，乙方的上级——中南工程管理局的党委书记，亲自到工地找双方的负责同志研究，希望他们继续发挥主动协作的精神，在协作中绝不允许有任何个人主义。甲方领导人员又在干部中进行教育，特别批判了在工程质量问题上单纯责备乙方的错误态度，提出甲乙双方都对工程质量负有责任，要求甲方工作人员今后在监督工程质量上，不仅要随时发现问题，并且要善意地帮助乙方解决问题。乙方领导人员也教育干部积极克服困难，同甲方共同搞好工程建设。双方又共同请苏联专家来检查工程质量，对质量不好的主厂房基础加以补救，并且决定成立由双方技术人员参加的技术会议，加强对工程质量的保证和监督。
    技术会议已经开了二十五次，效果很好。过去因为现场工作较乱，甲方技术人员检查出工程质量问题，找不到具体负责的人，很着急。乙方的工人也反映：“头绪太多，究竟听谁的好？”有了技术会议以后，有些在现场不能解决的问题，甲方便及时在会议上提出，乙方就负责加以解决。例如压缩机车间的毛石混凝土墙内有管子，乙方原来准备把光管子埋进去，甲方认为这个墙将来要起防潮的作用，把光管子埋进去会影响工程质量，便在会议上建议乙方用牛毛毡把管子包起来。
    最近，他们还决定建立甲乙丙（设计部门）三方的图纸会审制度和按季、按月制定协作计划的制度，决定甲方派人参加乙方的旬、月计划检查会议，加强协作。
    武汉肉类联合加工厂的新建工程动工不久，今后还会发生许多问题。因此，双方还要积极改善自己的工作，迅速改变因为工程提前动工而产生的忙乱情况，把工作纳入正规；尤其需要加强政治工作，进一步树立整体观念。
