    Half a Kilogram of Coal Can Generate One Kilowatt-hour of Electricity
    Currently, the state-owned Zhengzhou Power Plant only uses about 0.53 kilograms of coal to generate one kilowatt-hour of electricity, which is about 0.07 kilograms lower than the state-stipulated coal consumption target for this plant in 1957.
    The employees of the boiler division of this plant launched a socialist competition between boilers. Focusing on the large fluctuations in steam temperature during normal operation, especially the frequent excessively low steam temperatures that increase coal consumption, they promptly summarized and promoted the experience of stoker Chen Changlin and others in controlling steam temperature. This resulted in a general increase in average steam temperature compared to the past, and a significant reduction in the number of unqualified steam temperature incidents per shift. The employees also shared their experiences in anticipating load changes, avoiding sudden increases or improper matching of wind and coal, and preventing the phenomenon of a large amount of coal powder not being fully burned.

    半公斤煤就能发一度电
    现在，国营郑州电厂只用0.53公斤左右的煤就能发一度电，比国家规定这个厂在1957年每度电的煤耗量还低0.07公斤左右。
    这个厂锅炉分场的职工，开展了锅炉同锅炉间的社会主义竞赛。大家针对平时操作中汽温波动大，特别是汽温经常过低增加煤耗的原因，及时总结和推广了司炉陈长林等掌握汽温的经验，使平均汽温普遍比过去升高，每班的汽温不合格次数也大大减少。职工们还交流了如何预先掌握负荷变化的经验，避免风和煤突然增添或配合不当，使大量煤粉不能充分燃烧的现象。　　（据新华社讯）
