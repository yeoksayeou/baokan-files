    Too Many Tasks and Too Few
    In early February, the State-owned Industry Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of the heads of several state-owned machinery factories and state-owned factories, or the mechanical repair workshops of these factories, in Tianjin to assign the production task of gauges for double-wheeled, double-furrow plows. Ding Zhaoqi, the director of the Power Machinery Factory, was unwilling to attend the meeting, citing the fact that the Power Machinery Factory already had too many production tasks and simply did not have the capacity to take on this task. The person in charge of the State-owned Industry Department did not allow it, and Ding Zhaoqi had to reluctantly participate in the meeting. At the meeting, the person in charge of the State-owned Industry Department pointed out that the collaborative manufacturing of double-wheeled, double-furrow plows was a major political task that must be guaranteed to be completed, and anyone who refused would be making a mistake. Ding Zhaoqi had no choice but to grit his teeth and accept the task.
    When the workers of the Power Machinery Factory learned about the news of producing gauges for double-wheeled, double-furrow plows, their production enthusiasm was very high, and each workshop automatically sent representatives to the factory headquarters to accept the task. As a result, the task of 23 sets of gauges was snatched up; some workshops felt disappointed because they did not receive a task. The mechanical repair workshop of the Tianjin Textile Factory and the mechanical repair workshop of the Tianjin Cigarette Factory were also like this.
    This extremely stark contrast powerfully illustrates that the leadership's thinking lags far behind the masses. Leaders should quickly overcome this conservative thinking and step in front of the broad masses of workers.

    任务的太多和太少
    2月上旬，中共天津市委国营工业部召集了天津市几个国营机械厂和国营工厂或这些工厂的机械修理车间的负责人开会，布置制造双轮双铧犁量具的生产任务。动力机厂厂长丁兆祺不愿参加会议，理由是动力机厂的生产任务太重，根本没有力量来担负这一任务。国营工业部负责人没有允许，丁兆祺只得免强参加这个会议。会上，国营工业部负责人指出了协作制造双轮双铧犁是一项重大的政治任务，必须保证完成，谁拒绝谁就要犯错误。丁兆祺只得硬着头皮把任务接受下来。
    当动力机厂的工人们得到生产双轮双铧犁量具的消息的时候，生产情绪十分高涨，各个车间自动派代表到厂部去接受任务。结果，23套量具的任务一抢而光；有的车间因为没有领到任务而感到失望。天津纺织厂的机械修理车间和天津卷烟厂的机械修理车间也都是这样。
    这种极其鲜明的对照，有力地说明了领导思想大大落后于群众。领导者应当迅速克服这种保守思想，走到职工群众前面去。
