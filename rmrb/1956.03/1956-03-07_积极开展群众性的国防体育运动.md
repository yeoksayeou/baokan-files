    Actively Develop Mass National Defense Sports
    Modern national defense construction requires a strong national defense reserve force. Widely developing mass national defense sports activities is an important measure for cultivating a strong national defense reserve force.
    The Party and the government attach great importance to the mass national defense sports cause. In 1952, the Central National Defense Sports Club was established to create various national defense sports activities. According to incomplete statistics last year, more than 50 large and medium-sized cities across the country have begun to hold national defense sports activities including various projects, with more than 300,000 participants. Beijing and 14 other cities have established 464 activity groups of various kinds and trained 5,937 amateur instructors. Many young people have become excellent marksmen or motorcycle athletes through national defense sports training, some have initially mastered military navigation technology, some have learned to parachute and fly gliders, and some young people have honorably enlisted in the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
    However, the development of national defense sports is far behind the needs of the country and the demands of the people. In the past few years, the Central National Defense Sports Club has often received letters from the masses in various places, expressing their urgent desire to participate in national defense sports exercises. This patriotic enthusiasm of the people is a strong pillar for carrying out national defense sports activities and is very precious. However, the national defense sports work in the past four years has been limited to "key pilot projects" in certain cities. The leadership's plans have been too conservative, and they have not dared to boldly mobilize the masses to actively carry out national defense sports activities. Many places have not only failed to give due support and guidance to the movements spontaneously launched by the masses, but have instead used various methods to restrict them. Many places require students participating in national defense sports activities to meet the conditions of being "good in three aspects," or to have the recommendation of the Youth League, Young Pioneers, student union, or class before approval can be granted. Military camping activities are extremely popular among the masses and can be carried out on a large scale, but many places do not actively lead them. These have greatly restricted the enthusiasm of the masses and cadres and hindered the rapid development of national defense sports activities.
    Where is the problem? First of all, some leaders do not have a sufficient understanding of the great significance of national defense sports in defending the motherland and regard defending the motherland and strengthening national defense construction as purely matters for the military; at the same time, they believe that during the period of peaceful construction, since the army is not fighting, it is not necessary to strengthen it, nor is it necessary to support the army. Therefore, they regard national defense sports as something that is "dispensable," "can be big or small," and "can be tight or loose."
    Our country loves peace, and a large amount of our manpower, material resources, and financial resources must be used for peaceful construction. However, we must never forget that imperialist aggressive blocs are still actively planning wars, and our peaceful construction is under threat. National defense sports is a mass movement for the broad masses of people to support national defense construction, and it is also the most economical and effective way for the country to cultivate a large number of reserve soldiers. If we widely carry out national defense sports activities among 120 million young people, we will cultivate a large number of excellent marksmen, motorcyclists, radio operators, maritime personnel, parachutists, glider pilots, and pilots. Once the imperialist aggressive blocs dare to launch a war of aggression, we will have sufficient reserve forces to support the army and ensure the security of the motherland.
    The military equipment of the modernized national defense army is very complex, and every active serviceman must undergo a considerable period of study and training. If young people can participate in national defense sports before enlisting in the army, they can learn certain military knowledge and skills in advance, and after enlisting, they can master various military technologies more quickly, so that the quality of various services can be improved more quickly. Retired soldiers can also consolidate their existing military knowledge and skills by participating in national defense sports activities. In addition, carrying out national defense sports activities can also train a large number of radio operators, car drivers, tractor drivers, navigation and aviation talents for the country, directly serving socialist construction. It can be seen that the idea that national defense sports is dispensable is completely wrong.
    Secondly, the leadership of national defense sports work overestimates the difficulties in carrying out the movement, which is also an important reason why national defense sports has not been rapidly and widely carried out. In the initial stage of national defense sports, there will be some difficulties in terms of equipment, funding, and manpower, but these difficulties can be overcome. For example, most of the guns, ammunition, airplanes, gliders, parachutes, and marine equipment needed to carry out the movement can be produced in our country. As long as they are properly allocated, the problem can be solved. As for sports venues, as long as we vigorously promote public-private partnerships and widely mobilize the masses to carry out voluntary labor in their spare time, they can also be solved. Some people believe that we must wait until we have cultivated a sufficient number of cadres and accumulated very rich leadership experience before we can widely carry out national defense sports activities, which is also wrong. It should be pointed out that national defense sports is a mass movement and is carried out in spare time. As long as we rely on the masses and let go of mobilizing the masses, the difficulties in manpower, material resources, and financial resources can be overcome, and cadres can grow up in large numbers in the movement.
    In order to cultivate a strong modernized national defense reserve force, all localities should, in accordance with the principle of "more, faster, better, and more economical," vigorously carry out national defense sports activities such as shooting, motorcycles, automobiles, radio, air defense and anti-poisoning, military camping, equestrianism, military navigation, water sports, electromechanical, ship models, flying, gliding, parachuting, and aviation models throughout the country. In order to ensure the successful completion of the above tasks, the national defense sports leadership institutions at the central level and in various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions should be established as soon as possible to strengthen the leadership of national defense sports work and do a good job in the overall planning of the national defense sports cause.
    In order to widely carry out national defense sports activities, it is necessary to vigorously publicize the significance of this movement, especially the necessity of continuing to consolidate national defense, consolidate, and strengthen the People's Liberation Army. At the same time, it is necessary to train and cultivate a large number of amateur coaches, instructors, and activists, universally establish venues for various national defense sports activities, and widely carry out competition activities; relevant industrial departments should actively produce and supply the equipment needed to carry out national defense sports activities.
    In order to defend peace, our national defense forces must be strengthened. The development of national defense sports will enable the broad masses of working people in our country to learn many skills to defend the motherland, providing a strong reserve force for our country's modernized national defense.

### 积极开展群众性的国防体育运动

    积极开展群众性的国防体育运动
    现代化的国防建设需要强大的国防后备力量。广泛发展群众性的国防体育活动，是培养强大的国防后备力量的重要措施。
    党和政府非常重视群众性的国防体育事业，在1952年就建立了中央国防体育俱乐部，创办各项国防体育运动。据去年不完全的统计，全国已有50多个大、中城市开始举办了包括各种项目的国防体育运动，参加人数达30多万。北京等14个城市建立了464个各种活动小组，训练了业余辅导员5，937人。有许多青年通过国防体育的训练，成为优秀射手或摩托车运动员，有的初步掌握了军事航海技术，有的学会了跳伞和驾驶滑翔机，有些青年已光荣应征，参加了中国人民解放军。
    但是，国防体育运动的发展还远远落后于国家的需要和人民群众的要求。几年来，中央国防体育俱乐部经常收到各地的群众来信，群众表示迫切地要求参加国防体育锻炼。人民群众这种爱国热忱，对于开展国防体育运动是强有力的支柱，是十分宝贵的。但是，四年来的国防体育工作还只限于在某些城市“重点试办”，领导方面计划订得过于保守，不敢大胆放手地发动群众积极开展国防体育运动。许多地方对于群众自发搞起来的运动，不但没有给以应有的支持和指导，反而用各种方法加以限制。许多地方对参加国防体育活动的学生，要求必须具备“三好”的条件，或者要有青年团、少先队、学生会、班的保送，才能批准。军事野营活动极受广大群众欢迎，也能够大规模开展，但许多地方也不积极领导。这些都大大地限制了群众和干部的积极性，阻碍了国防体育运动的迅速开展。
    问题在哪里呢？首先是某些领导人员对国防体育事业在保卫祖国方面的重大意义认识不足，把保卫祖国、加强国防建设看做单纯是军队的事情；同时，他们又以为在和平建设时期，军队既不作战，就不必加强，也用不着支援军队。因此就把国防体育看做“可有可无”、“可大可小”、“可紧可松”的事情。
    我们国家热爱和平，我们的大量人力、物力和财力都必须用于和平建设。但是我们决不可因此忘记帝国主义侵略集团还正在积极策划战争，我们的和平建设正在受到威胁。国防体育是广大人民支援国防建设的群众运动，也是国家培养大量后备兵源最经济有效的办法。如果我们在12，000万青年中广泛开展国防体育运动，就会培养出大量的优秀射手、摩托手、无线电员、海上人员、跳伞员、滑翔员、飞行员。一旦帝国主义侵略集团胆敢发动侵略战争，我们就有足够的后备力量支援军队，确保祖国的安全。
    现代化的国防军军事装备很复杂，每一个现役军人都必须经过相当时间的学习和训练。青年们如果能在应征入伍前参加国防体育运动，就能够事先学到一定的军事知识和技术，入伍以后就可以更快地掌握各种军事技术，使各军种的质量更快地提高。退伍军人参加国防体育运动，也可以巩固已有的军事知识和技术。此外，开展国防体育运动还可以为国家训练出大量的无线电员、汽车司机、拖拉机手、航海和航空人材，直接为社会主义建设服务。由此可见，认为国防体育运动可有可无的思想是完全错误的。
    其次，国防体育工作的领导人员过高地估计开展运动中的困难，也是国防体育运动没有迅速广泛开展起来的重要原因。国防体育在创办初期，器材、经费、人力等方面会遇到一些困难，但这些困难都是可以克服的。比如开展运动所需要的大部分枪支弹药、飞机、滑翔机、降落伞和航海等器材，我国都能生产，只要妥善调配，就可以解决问题。至于运动场地，只要大力提倡民办公助，广泛发动群众在业余时间进行义务劳动，也可以解决。有些人认为必须等到培养了足够数量的干部，积累了十分丰富的领导经验，才能广泛开展国防体育运动，这也是错误的。应当指出：国防体育运动是群众性的运动，而且是在业余时间进行的，只要依靠群众，放手发动群众，人力、物力、财力的困难就可以克服，干部也能在运动中大批地成长起来。
    为了培养雄厚的现代化国防后备队，各地应当根据“又多、又快、又好、又省”的原则，在全国大力开展射击、摩托车、汽车、无线电、防空防毒、军事野营、马术、军事航海、水上运动、机电、舰船模型、飞行、滑翔、跳伞、航空模型等项国防体育运动。为了保证上述任务的胜利完成，应当首先将中央级及各省、市、自治区的国防体育领导机构尽快地建立起来，加强国防体育工作的领导，并且做好国防体育事业的全盘规划工作。
    为了广泛开展国防体育运动，必须大力宣传这一运动的意义，特别是宣传继续巩固国防、巩固和壮大人民解放军的必要性。同时必须大量训练和培养业余教练员、辅导员、积极分子，普遍地建立各项国防体育运动的活动场所，广泛开展竞赛活动；有关工业部门应当积极生产和供应开展国防体育运动所需要的器材。
    为了保卫和平，我们的国防力量必须加强。国防体育运动的开展，将使我国广大劳动人民学会许多保卫祖国的本领，为我国现代化的国防提供强大的后备力量。
