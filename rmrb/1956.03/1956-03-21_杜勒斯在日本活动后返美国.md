Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 20th: Dulles left Japan on March 19th to return to the United States, ending his "visit" activities which were opposed everywhere.

When Dulles arrived in Japan on March 18th, he announced as soon as he got off the plane that his intention was to discuss with Japanese leaders the issue of Japan's contribution to the "strategic aspects of development" in the Western Pacific and South Asia. Sources say that Dulles's remarks implied that the U.S. government hoped Japan would revise its constitution so that Japan could send its troops abroad.

However, as soon as Dulles arrived in Tokyo, he encountered demonstrations by many Japanese people. At the airport, many people wanted to submit petitions to Dulles, but were stopped by Japanese police. Before Dulles even reached the U.S. Embassy in Japan, representatives of many public organizations had already gathered in front of the embassy, holding flags with slogans such as "Stop Nuclear Weapons Testing," and submitted many petitions to Dulles through the U.S. Embassy. They demanded that the United States stop nuclear weapons tests in the Pacific, relax the "embargo" restrictions on China, remove U.S. military bases in Japan, and return Okinawa to Japan.

Dulles held talks with Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama and Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu in Tokyo. During the talks, he asked Japan to maintain "close ties" with so-called "free countries" and stressed that Japan should strengthen its armed forces.

According to Kyodo News: During the talks, Ichiro Hatoyama requested the United States to relax "embargo" restrictions, and explained the importance of Japan's trade with China to the Japanese economy. However, Dulles stated that the United States had "no change" in its "embargo" policy. Dulles also gave no specific assurances regarding Japan's requests for proper handling of nuclear weapons testing and allowing residents of the Ogasawara Islands in Japan to return home. Dulles explained his views on the normalization negotiations between Japan and the Soviet Union during the talks, and Dulles encouraged Japan to insist on the return of so-called "detained personnel."

    杜勒斯在日本活动后返美国
    新华社20日讯　东京消息：杜勒斯已经在三月十九日离开日本回美国，结束了他的到处遭到反对的“访问”活动。
    杜勒斯在三月十八日到日本的时候，刚下飞机就宣布他的来意是：和日本领袖讨论包括日本对西太平洋和南亚的“战略方面的发展”作出贡献的问题。有消息说，杜勒斯的这番话暗含着美国政府希望日本做到修改宪法，以使日本可以把自己的军队派遣到国外去。
    但是，杜勒斯一到东京就遇到日本许多群众的示威。在飞机场上，很多人要向杜勒斯提交请愿书，但是被日本警察拦住。杜勒斯还没有到达美国驻日大使馆以前，很多公众团体的代表就已经聚集在大使馆门前，他们手里拿着写有要求停止试验核子武器等字样的旗帜，并且通过美国大使馆向杜勒斯提出了许多请愿书。他们要求美国停止在太平洋进行核子武器试验、放宽对中国实行的“禁运”限制，撤除美国在日本的军事基地以及要求美国把冲绳岛归还日本。
    杜勒斯在东京曾经同日本首相鸠山一郎和外务相重光葵等人举行了会谈。他在会谈中，要求日本同所谓“自由国家”保持“密切的联系”，并且强调日本应该加强它的武装力量。
    据共同社报道：在会谈中，鸠山一郎曾经要求美国放宽“禁运”限制，并且说明了日本同中国贸易对日本经济的重要性。但是，杜勒斯表明，美国在“禁运”政策上“没有任何改变”。对于日本所要求的妥善处理试验核子武器和允许在日本的小笠原群岛居民还乡的问题，杜勒斯也没有给予具体保证。杜勒斯在会谈中说明了他对日苏关系正常化谈判的见解，杜勒斯曾鼓动日本坚持要求送还所谓“被扣人员”。
