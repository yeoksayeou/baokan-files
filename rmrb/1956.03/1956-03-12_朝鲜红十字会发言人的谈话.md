Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 11th. A spokesperson for the Korean Red Cross issued a statement on March 10 regarding the release of Korean citizens detained at the Omura Detention Center in Japan, stating that according to recent foreign news agency reports, the Japanese government recently announced that 200 Korean citizens detained at the Omura Detention Center have been released, and another 300 will be released soon. Those who were released were only released after "swearing" that they were returning to South Korea according to their "free will."

The spokesperson said that the Japanese government's act of forcing those released to "swear" to go to South Korea shows that it does not want to properly resolve the issue of Korean citizens detained at the Omura Detention Center as a humanitarian issue, but rather uses them as hostages in exchange for the release of Japanese fishermen detained in South Korea.

The spokesperson said that we maintain that the Japanese authorities should guarantee that they regain their freedom as soon as possible and live normal lives.

    朝鲜红十字会发言人的谈话
    据新华社平壤11日电　朝鲜红十字会发言人3月10日就被扣留在日本大村收容所的朝鲜公民的释放问题发表谈话说，根据最近外国通讯社报道，日本政府最近宣布，被扣留在大村收容所的朝鲜公民中有200人已经获释，并且不久还将有300人获释。那些被释放的人是在“宣誓”他们是按照“自由意志”要回南朝鲜后才得到释放的。
    发言人说，日本政府迫使得到释放的人“宣誓”到南朝鲜一事，表明它并不想作为人道问题来正当解决被扣留在大村收容所的朝鲜公民问题，而是把他们当作人质，以释放被扣留在南朝鲜的日本渔民作为交换条件。
    发言人说，我们主张，日本当局应当保证使他们尽快恢复自由，过正常的生活。
