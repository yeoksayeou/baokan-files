    A Century-Old Dispute, Resolved at Once
    Wang Xizheng

    Wangzhuang and Juling villages in LinYing County, Henan Province, have often suffered from floods. The farmers have all wanted to dig a drainage ditch between the two villages to connect to the Zhai River, thereby reducing the disaster. However, in the past, because of the several pieces of land belonging to Wang Yanben and others in between, they refused to allow it, leaving many people anxious and unable to do anything. Because of this matter, the people of the two villages were constantly at odds and had not reconciled for over a hundred years. Last autumn, they almost started fighting.

    Fifty years ago, there was such a rule: "Don't change the ditch upstream; don't dam the weir downstream." However, when Wangzhuang had too much water, they would secretly change the course of the ditch eastward in the middle of the night, flooding the land of Juling village. The people of Juling were naturally unwilling. Every time it rained heavily, they would guard the ditch day and night with weapons. If the people of Wangzhuang dug the ditch again, a melee would ensue. Wangzhuang had fewer households. Every time the people of Juling defended, no one dared to dig anymore, and they could only sit and watch their crops be flooded and their houses collapse. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, Wangzhuang produced a Wang Juren (a successful candidate in the imperial examinations). He frequented official residences and government offices, and had a lot of influence. The gentry of Juling did not dare to offend him. Relying on the influence of the Juren, the people of Wangzhuang dug a ditch three feet wide and thirty feet long between the two villages. The water from Wangzhuang flowed into the Zhai River of Juling through this ditch, and they were safe and sound. The land where the ditch was dug was entirely Juling's, and the water flowed to Juling, which angered many people in Juling. However, they were all afraid of Wang Juren, and no one dared to say anything. This ditch remained for twenty or thirty years.

    After Wang Juren died, Juling produced a Cui Dachui, a tough guy who was not afraid of death in a fight. He led people to flatten the ditch. Wangzhuang village was small and no longer had anyone with influence, so they did not dare to say anything. The landlords of Juling, in order to "vent their anger," pulled soil onto the land around Wangzhuang year after year, making it lower and lower, and accumulating more and more water. The people of Wangzhuang had no choice but to protect their houses and ignore their land - if the water was low, they would endure the flooding; if the water was high, they would dig a ditch in the west to let the water flow north, and then fill it up and plant crops after the water receded. From then on, the farmers of Wangzhuang became poorer and poorer. Out of the forty households in the village, many went out to beg for food all year round.

    Later, Wangzhuang produced a Fengshui master who took care of the graves called Meng Yini, who specialized in manipulating the farmers. He said that the water flowing from the north of Wangzhuang Street was a “piercing arrow” that violated the land's energy; if the water was allowed to flow north again, they would become poorer and poorer, until they were ruined and their families were destroyed. The farmers of Wangzhuang believed this and filled the land north of the village higher and higher. When they encountered water, they could not dig a ditch to the north or east, so they had to sit and watch their walls collapse and their wives and children become a mess.

    After the Communist Party came, the farmers of Wangzhuang urgently demanded a solution to this problem. The farmers of Juling were also unwilling to be angry with the farmers of Wangzhuang any longer. However, no one was willing to let the water flow through their land. This problem was not resolved until 1955.

    In the autumn of 1955, the water was higher than any other year. The people of Wangzhuang wanted to dig a ditch, and the people of Juling went to block it. One side dug, the other side blocked, and the dispute was unresolved. As a result, two ditches were dug, one to the north and one to the east, and both sides flooded their crops.

    In October of last year, after the farmers of both villages studied Chairman Mao's instructions on agricultural cooperation, they enthusiastically demanded to establish advanced cooperatives. Wangzhuang had more poor farmers and was more active in establishing advanced cooperatives. In December, the two villages joined together and established an advanced cooperative. The land belonged to the collective of the entire cooperative. When formulating water conservancy plans, the management committee and the farmers of the two villages discussed this issue again. The people of Wangzhuang said: Both villages are now one family, and we feel sorry for the crops that are flooded. The management committee can decide wherever it is dug, as long as our houses are not flooded. The people of Juling said: Let's dig a ditch directly east of Wangzhuang. Digging north is higher, takes more effort, and floods more crops, which is not worthwhile.

    In the past, the old men of the two villages would not even greet each other when they met. Now, they greet each other from afar. They all said with smiles: Now we are all one family, a century-old dispute has been resolved in a day, and the long-cherished wish of generations has finally been realized!

    百年纠纷，一旦解决
    王西正
    河南省临颍县王庄和巨陵常遭水害，农民都想在两个村子之间挖一条排水沟，通往寨河，减免水灾。可是，在过去，因为中间隔着王彦本等的好几块地，他们不叫挖，很多人干着急办不成。为这桩事，两个村的人闹得翻贴门神不对脸，一百多年以来一直没有和解，去年秋天还几乎打起架来。
    五十年前，有这样一个规矩：“上不改沟；下不闸堰。”可是，王庄水大顶不了的时候，就趁夜半偷向东改，淹到巨陵村的地。巨陵的人当然不愿意，每逢下了大雨，就白天黑夜地拿着武器看守；王庄的人再挖沟，就实行械斗。王庄人户少，每逢巨陵的人一防守，就没人敢再挖，坐等着庄稼受淹，房倒屋塌。清代末年，王庄出了个王举人。他走官宅、串衙门，很有面子，巨陵的豪绅们都不敢惹他。王庄人仗着举人的势力，在两村中间挖了一条宽三尺、长三十丈的沟。王庄的水从这条沟里流到巨陵寨河，就平安无事。挖沟的地完全是巨陵的，水又向巨陵流，巨陵好些人都气忿。可是，都怕王举人，谁也不敢吱声。这条沟整整存留了二、三十年。
    王举人死后，巨陵出了个崔大垂，是个土楞子（土光棍），打架生死不怕，领着人硬把沟平啦。王庄村小，没有了有势力的人，也就不敢吭声。巨陵的地主们为了要“出一口气”，他们在王庄周围的地上年年月月拉土，越拉越凹，积水越多。王庄的人没有办法了，只好顾房子不顾地——水小了挺着淹；水大了就在西头挖条沟，让水向北流，水过后填平再种庄稼。从此，王庄农民越来越穷了。全村四十户，整年有在外逃荒要饭的。
    后来，王庄又出了个看茔地的阴阳先生叫孟义妮，专会摆布农民。他说王庄水从街上正北流犯地病，是条“穿心箭”；如果再叫水向北走，就会越来越穷，一直穷得家败人亡。王庄农民信了这一套，把庄北的地越填越高。遇到了水，向北向东都挖不了沟，只好坐看墙倒屋塌，老婆孩子乱如麻。
    共产党来了，王庄农民迫切要求解决这个问题。巨陵农民也不愿再跟王庄的农民生气。可是，让水从自己的地里走，谁都不愿意。这个问题一直拖到1955年也没解决。
    1955年秋天，水比那一年都大。王庄的人要挖沟，巨陵的人就去闸沟。这边挖，那边闸，争执不下。结果，挖了两条沟，一条正北，一条正东，两下都淹了庄稼。
    去年十月间，两村农民学习了毛主席关于农业合作化的指示后，都热烈要求办高级社。王庄贫农多，对办高级社更积极。十二月，两村合起来建成了一个高级社，土地归全社集体所有了。制定水利规划的时候，管理委员会和两村农民又商量这个问题。王庄的人说：两村都成一家啦，淹毁那里庄稼都心疼，管理委员会研究决定好啦，只要不叫房子泡塌，在哪里挖俺都没意见。巨陵的人说：从王庄正东挖条沟吧，往北挖地势高、费劲大，淹毁庄稼又多，不合算。
    过去，为这桩事，两个村的老头们见面碰头都不答腔。现在，多远就打招呼。他们都喜笑颜开地说：现在都成了一家人，一百年的纠纷一天解决啦，人老几辈子的心愿现在算是实现啦！
