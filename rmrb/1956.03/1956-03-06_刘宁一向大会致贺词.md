Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 5th – Rome Dispatch: Liu Ningyi, head of the Chinese delegation attending the Fourth National Congress of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, delivered a congratulatory message to the congress on February 29th.

	He extended warm, brotherly greetings on behalf of all Chinese workers to the delegates of the congress, and through them, to all Italian workers.

	Liu Ningyi said that Chinese workers have always watched and cared about the heroic struggle of the Italian working class. The Italian General Confederation of Labor has consistently remained true to the principle of working-class unity and has made significant contributions to the unification of the international trade union movement in the ten years since the war.

	After introducing the achievements of the Chinese working class and the entire Chinese people in various aspects of socialist transformation and construction, Liu Ningyi said: After the Second World War, American imperialism conducted a "Cold War" and prepared for a hot war, bringing many disasters and suffering to the Italian people and greatly endangering Italy's national security. Even now, the United States still occupies China's territory of Taiwan, and the Chinese people are suffering from American war threats. These two ancient civilizations, located in the East and the West, are today threatened from the same source. This shared experience makes our two peoples care for each other and sympathize with and support each other in the common struggle to defend our respective territorial sovereignty and resist aggression to defend peace.

	Liu Ningyi pointed out that since the founding of the People's Republic of China, economic, cultural, and artistic exchanges between the Chinese and Italian peoples have increased compared to the past. Under the leadership of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the working classes of China and Italy have engaged in a joint struggle in the movement to strive for the unity of the international trade union movement and to defend world peace, which has made our friendship even closer.

    刘宁一向大会致贺词
    据新华社布拉格5日电  罗马消息：参加意大利总工会第四届全国代表大会的中国代表团团长刘宁一在2月29日向大会致贺词。
    他代表全体中国工人向大会各位代表们，并且通过他们向全意大利工人致以热烈的兄弟般的敬礼。
    刘宁一说，中国工人一向注视和关切意大利工人阶级的英勇斗争。意大利总工会始终忠实于工人阶级团结的原则，在战后十年来为国际工会运动的统一作出了重大的贡献。
    刘宁一在介绍了中国工人阶级和全国人民在社会主义改造和建设各方面的成就以后说：第二次世界大战后，美帝国主义进行“冷战”，并且准备热战，为意大利人民带来了许多灾难和痛苦，大大地危害意大利的国家安全。现在，美国也还占领着中国的领土台湾，中国人民遭受着美国的战争威胁。我们这两个分处在东方和西方的文明古国，在今天都受到来自同一方面的威胁。这种同样的遭遇使我们两国人民相互关切，并且在为保卫各自的领土主权完整和反抗侵略保卫和平的共同斗争中，相互同情和支持。
    刘宁一指出，中华人民共和国成立后，中意两国人民在经济上和文化艺术上的接触较前增加，中意两国工人阶级在世界工联的领导下，在为争取国际工会运动的团结和保卫世界和平的运动中，进行了共同的奋斗，这使得我们的友谊更为密切了。
