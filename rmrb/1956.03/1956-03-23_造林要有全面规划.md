    Afforestation Requires Comprehensive Planning

    Changliu Township in Qiyang County, Hunan Province, has more than 1,800 mu of barren hills. This year, when afforestation was carried out, all agricultural production cooperatives paid attention to pasture planning in advance. Because the cattle here need to graze on the mountains, each cooperative appropriately allocated a certain area of pasture land according to the number of cattle in the cooperative, which was temporarily not afforested. For example, the Quanxin Agricultural Production Cooperative has more than 20 cattle and reserved more than 50 mu of pasture land on the barren hills, which everyone is very satisfied with. Heping Township in Wugang County did not do this. Township cadres blindly mobilized farmers to afforest everywhere on the barren hills without reasonably delineating pasture areas. The masses were very dissatisfied and sarcastically said: "In the future, the cows will have to be carried in sedan chairs."

    Facts have repeatedly proven that blind afforestation will not only fail to effectively green barren hills and wasteland, but will also cause waste to the country and the masses. Before afforestation, all localities must formulate comprehensive plans based on specific conditions and the needs of developing agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, and mobilize the masses to afforest in a planned way. In this way, afforestation work can achieve the desired results.

    造林要有全面规划
    湖南省祁阳县长流乡有一千八百多亩荒山。今年造林的时候，各个农业生产合作社事先都注意了牧场的规划。因为这里的耕牛需要在山上放牧，各个合作社就根据社里耕牛头数，适当地划出一定面积的牧地，暂时不造林。如全心农业生产合作社有二十多头牛，在荒山上留了牧地五十多亩，大家都很满意。武冈县和平乡没有这样做，乡里干部盲目发动农民在荒山上到处造林，没有合理划定牧区，群众很不满意，讽刺说：“以后牛要用轿子抬起来走了。”
    事实一再证明，盲目造林，不但不能有效地绿化荒山荒地，而且会给国家和群众造成浪费。各地在造林以前，必须根据具体条件和发展农业、林业、畜牧业的需要，作出全面的规划，发动群众有计划地造林。这样，造林工作才能收到应有的效果。
