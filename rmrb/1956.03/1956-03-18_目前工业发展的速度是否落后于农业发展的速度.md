A letter from Comrade Sha Zhengfu of the Mining Machinery Repair Plant of the Xi'an Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry asks: Chairman Mao said in the preface to "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside" that due to the upsurge of the agricultural cooperativization movement, "the scale and speed of China's industrialization... can no longer be done entirely according to what was originally conceived, and these should be appropriately expanded and accelerated." Does this mean that the current speed of industrial development is falling behind the speed of agricultural development?

Now, we answer this question as follows:

In the second half of 1955, the agricultural cooperativization movement developed rapidly. By the end of the year, more than 60% of farmers had joined semi-socialist agricultural production cooperatives, and some places had even organized fully socialist agricultural production cooperatives in batches. This has put the small-scale peasant economy on the track of collective management, and to a large extent, has liberated agricultural productive forces, preparing the conditions for thoroughly resolving the contradiction between agricultural backwardness and industrial development. In 1955, China's agriculture achieved unprecedented harvests, and the situation of insufficient national food supply and inadequate supply of industrial raw materials was greatly changed in 1956, which will promote the accelerated development of industry and the overall development of the national economy.

However, this does not mean that the problem of agricultural production development speed has been solved, or that the contradiction between agricultural development lagging behind industrial development has been completely resolved. Because, at present, the yield per unit area of agriculture in our country is still not high, and the total output of grain, cotton, and other cash crops is still not large. Calculated on the basis of a population of 600 million, the annual output of grain and cotton in our country is only an average of more than 500 jin of grain and about 4 jin of cotton per person per year, which is far from meeting the needs of China's socialist industrialization and the growing needs of the people's lives. On the basis of semi-socialist agricultural cooperation, although agriculture increases production to a certain extent every year, on the whole, agricultural production is still not likely to meet the needs of industrial development and the improvement of people's lives to a greater extent. Taking 1955 as an example, although there was a bumper harvest of crops, the output of cash crops was not enough to enable the existing light industrial equipment to exert 100% of its effectiveness in 1956. Only when agriculture is fully cooperativized, and mechanization is realized on this basis, can agricultural production be greatly increased, and agriculture can be more compatible with the development of industry. To achieve this, we still need to go through a long period of effort.

Due to the accelerated development of agricultural cooperativization and the bumper harvest of agriculture, farmers' demand for certain means of production has greatly increased. Therefore, since the fourth quarter of 1955, there has been a situation where the supply of agricultural tools and water conservancy machinery industrial products has fallen short of demand.

Because in the next three or four years, our country will basically complete the socialist transformation of agriculture, advanced large-scale agricultural production cooperatives will need a large number of tractors and other agricultural machines, water conservancy machinery, chemical fertilizers, modern transportation tools, fuel, and electricity, etc. Therefore, the situation that the output of certain industrial products cannot meet or fully meet the needs of agricultural development may also exist for a relatively long period of time. We must immediately start to accelerate the development of the production of these agricultural means of production to ensure the further development of agricultural production and the consolidation of agricultural production cooperatives. In fact, our country currently has great industrial equipment potential for manufacturing agricultural means of production and farmers' living materials. As long as we can overcome conservative thinking and strengthen planning and organizational work, we can better serve agricultural production and appropriately meet the requirements of farmers.

The requirement put forward by Chairman Mao in the preface to "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside" that "the scale and speed of China's industrialization... should be appropriately expanded and accelerated" is of course not only based on the needs of agriculture. In addition to agriculture, the technical transformation of industry itself and the transportation industry, the growth of national defense forces, the improvement of people's lives, and the increase of industrial exports have all put forward many needs for industry, requiring industry to develop faster. At the same time, according to domestic and foreign political, economic, and technological conditions, we also have many favorable factors that can increase the speed of industrial development and expand the scale of industrial construction. As long as the people of the whole country work hard, we will be able to promote the cause of national socialist industrialization faster.

### 目前工业发展的速度是否落后于农业发展的速度

    目前工业发展的速度是否落后于农业发展的速度
    煤炭工业部西安管理局矿山机械修配厂沙正夫同志来信问：毛主席在“中国农村的社会主义高潮”序言中说，由于农业合作化运动的高涨，“中国的工业化的规模和速度……，已经不能完全按照原来所想的那个样子去做了，这些都应当适当地扩大和加快。”这是不是意味着目前工业发展的速度已经落后于农业发展的速度呢？
    现在，我们对这个问题答复如下：
    1955年下半年，农业合作化运动有了飞快的发展，到年底已经有60％以上的农户参加了半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社，有些地方还成批地组织起完全社会主义性质的农业生产合作社。这样，就使小农经济开始转到了集体经营的轨道上来，而且在很大程度上使农业的生产力得到了解放，为彻底地解决农业落后于工业的矛盾准备了条件。1955年我国农业得到了空前的丰收，全国粮食供应不很充裕和工业原料供应不足的状况在1956年有了很大的改变，从而将促进工业的加快发展和国民经济的全面发展。
    但是，这并不是说：农业生产发展速度的问题已经解决了，或者农业发展落后于工业发展的矛盾已经彻底解决了。因为，目前我国农业的单位面积产量还是不高的，粮食和棉花及其他技术作物的总产量也还是不多的。我国粮食和棉花的年产量，按6亿人口计算，每人每年平均仅有500多斤粮食，4斤左右的棉花，还远远不能满足我国社会主义工业化的需要和日益增长的人民生活的需要。在农业半社会主义合作化的基础上，虽然农业每年都有一定程度的增产，但是整个来说，农业生产还不可能在较大程度上满足工业发展和人民生活提高的需要。以1955年来说，农作物虽然丰收，但是技术作物的产量还不能使现有的轻工业设备在1956年发挥100％的效能。只有当农业全部地实现了合作化，而且在这个基础上实现了机械化，才能够大大地提高农业生产量，才能够使农业同工业的发展比较相适应。要做到这样，我们还需要经过一个较长时期的努力。
    由于农业合作化的加快发展和农业的丰收，农民对于某些生产资料的需要大大增加了，因而从1955年第四季度开始，农具和水利机械工业产品出现了供不应求的状况。
    由于今后三、四年的时间里，我国将基本上完成对农业的社会主义改造，高级的大型的农业生产合作社需要大量拖拉机和其他的农业机器，水利机械，化学肥料，现代化的交通运输工具，燃料和电力等等。因此，某些工业产品的产量不能满足或完全满足农业发展的需要的情况，在比较长的时期内，也是可能存在的。我们必须立即动手来加快发展这些农业生产资料的生产，以保证农业生产的进一步发展和农业生产合作社的巩固。事实上我国目前制造农业生产资料和农民生活资料的工业设备潜力还很大，只要能够克服保守思想，加强计划工作和组织工作，也就可以更好地为农业生产服务，适当满足农民的要求。
    毛主席在“中国农村的社会主义高潮”序言中所提出的“中国的工业化的规模和速度……应当适当地扩大和加快”的要求，当然不只是根据农业这一个方面的需要，除农业以外，工业本身和交通运输业的技术改造，国防力量的增长，人民生活的改善，出口工业品的增加等等，都向工业提出了很多的需要，要求工业加快地发展。同时，根据国内外政治、经济、技术的条件来说，我们也有很多有利的因素能够提高工业发展的速度，扩大工业建设的规模。只要全国人民努力，我们就有可能更快地推进国家社会主义工业化的事业。
