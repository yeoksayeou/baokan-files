　　Xinhua News Agency, Montevideo, 10th (TASS): The Executive Committee of the Uruguayan Communist Party issued a statement on the domestic situation at the end of the first year of the new Uruguayan government. The Executive Committee pointed out that Uruguay's economic and political situation is becoming acute, with agricultural production declining, foreign trade shrinking, prices and taxes rising, and 50,000 of the country's 200,000 workers unemployed.

　　The statement pointed out that American monopoly capital, which controls many enterprises, has taken large sums of profit from Uruguay by exploiting workers. American-owned slaughtering, refrigeration, and processing companies alone have earned profits of $81 million in the last nine years. The statement emphasized that the country needs to implement an independent foreign policy based on protecting national sovereignty, peace, freedom, and trade.

　　The Communist Party Executive Committee called on the working people of the whole country, all residents, and all political parties to jointly struggle for the realization of such a program: implement an independent foreign policy, develop trade with the Soviet Union and China, abolish military agreements concluded with the United States, protect democratic freedom and trade union freedom, increase the wages of workers and staff, lower prices, and take measures against foreign monopoly capital.

    乌拉圭共产党就国内局势发表声明
    新华社10日讯　塔斯社蒙得维的亚10日讯：乌拉圭共产党执行委员会在乌拉圭新政府第一年工作结束的时候发表了关于国内局势的声明。执行委员会指出，乌拉圭的经济和政治局势正在变得尖锐，农业生产在下降，对外贸易在缩减，物价和赋税在上涨，全国20万工人中有5万人失业。
    声明中指出，控制着许多企业的美国垄断资本，靠剥削工人把大笔的利润从乌拉圭拿走了。仅是美商的一些屠宰冷藏兼营所在最近9年中就赚得了8，100万美元的利润。声明中着重指出，国家须要实行一种以保护国家主权、和平、自由、贸易为基础的独立外交政策。
    共产党执行委员会号召全国的劳动人民、全体居民和各政党为争取实现这样一个纲领而共同奋斗：执行独立的外交政策，同苏联和中国发展贸易，废除同美国缔结的军事协定，保护民主自由和工会自由，增加职工的工资，降低物价，采取反对外国垄断资本的措施。
