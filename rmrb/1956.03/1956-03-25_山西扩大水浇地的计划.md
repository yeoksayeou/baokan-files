    Shanxi's Plan to Expand Irrigated Land
    In 1956, Shanxi Province plans to expand irrigated land by seven million mu. Since last winter, two million farmers across the province have launched a large-scale water conservancy construction campaign in plains and mountainous areas. From October last year to the end of February this year, according to incomplete statistics from the Jinnan, Yuci, Changzhi, Xinzhou, and Yanbei regions, 8,984 irrigation projects, including canals, reservoirs, well digging, and ponds, have been completed or are nearing completion, along with 49,228 wells, expanding the irrigated area by a total of 2.42 million mu. These projects can all be put into production before spring plowing and sowing, and will fully play the role of preserving soil moisture for sowing and preventing drought to protect seedlings. At the same time, 7,855 flood control and drainage projects have been completed or are nearing completion, which can protect 128,400 mu of cultivated land from the threat of floods, and can also use floodwaters to enrich 80,500 mu of land, ensuring increased crop production; in addition, 36,800 mu of cultivated land that frequently suffered from waterlogging has been freed from years of accumulated water and turned into fertile land.

    山西扩大水浇地的计划
    山西省在1956年，全省要扩大七百万亩水浇地。自去冬以来，全省有二百万农民在平川和山地开展了大规模兴修水利运动。从去年十月份到今年二月底止，据晋南、榆次、长治、忻县、雁北五个专区不完全统计：已经完成和正在完成的渠道、水库、挖泉、池塘等灌溉工程8，984处，水井49，228眼，共扩大灌溉面积242万亩。这些工程在春耕播种前可全部投入生产，将充分发挥保墒播种和防旱保苗的功用。同时已经完成和接近完工的防洪和排涝工程7，855处，可以使128，400亩耕地免除洪水威胁，并且可引洪淤地80，500亩，保证农田增产；另外还把36，800亩经常遭受内涝的耕地排除了多年积水，变成了良田。
