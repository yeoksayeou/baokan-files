The CCP Hubei Provincial Committee and Fushun Municipal Committee Hold Meetings
To Discuss Leadership Issues in the New Upsurge of Workers' Construction Enthusiasm

The CCP Hubei Provincial Committee held an industrial and transportation political work conference from the 3rd to the 7th to discuss strengthening the leadership of the new upsurge of enthusiasm among workers in participating in socialist construction. The meeting required all municipal committees and enterprise party committees to have their secretaries take the lead and mobilize the entire party to push forward the new upsurge of socialist construction enthusiasm among the workers.

The meeting believed that a new upsurge of socialist construction enthusiasm among the workers had already emerged throughout the province. The province's eight key basic construction units have respectively guaranteed completion half a year to one year ahead of schedule. The province's local industries and three transportation systems will also complete the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule. Therefore, the meeting required all urban party committees and enterprise party committees to concentrate their efforts on strengthening leadership in production and construction, and to promptly summarize and promote advanced experiences, in order to drive the backward with the advanced and improve work universally. The meeting also required all enterprises to adopt six basic measures, combining labor emulation, comprehensive planning, and socialist propaganda to ensure that the work is done well.

Xinhua News Agency: The CCP Fushun Municipal Committee held an industrial conference from the 3rd to the 9th, pointing out that the situation of a new upsurge of enthusiasm among Fushun City workers in participating in socialist industrial construction has formed throughout the city. Since Pang Guanxiang and Zhou Guangrui created new coal mining methods, more than 3,900 advanced producers and more than 650 advanced workshops, sections, and teams have emerged in factories and mines throughout the city. City workers have put forward more than 25,000 rationalization proposals, equivalent to the total number of rationalization proposals put forward by workers throughout the year last year.

In light of this situation, Shen Yue, Secretary of the CCP Fushun Municipal Committee, pointed out in his concluding remarks at the meeting that in the new upsurge, party organizations at all levels must continue to oppose right-leaning conservative thinking with practical actions that support advanced figures and cherish new things. He asked party organizations at all levels to mobilize and organize workers to learn from the creative spirit of Pang Guanxiang and Zhou Guangrui of the Tiger Terrace Mine, promote various advanced experiences, and also asked party organizations at all levels to conscientiously implement the policies of safe production and wage rewards.

    讨论职工建设热情新高涨的领导问题
    中共湖北省委在3日到7日召开工业交通政治工作会议，讨论了加强对职工群众参加社会主义建设热情新高涨的领导问题。会议要求各市委、各企业党委作到书记动手，全党动员，把职工群众社会主义建设热情的新高涨推向前进。

    根据这一情况，中共抚顺市委员会书记沈越在会议总结时指出：各级党组织在新高涨中，必须以支持先进人物、爱护新生事物的实际行动，继续反对右倾保守思想。他要求各级党组织发动和组织职工学习老虎台矿庞观祥、周广瑞的创造精神，推广各种先进经验，并且要求各级党组织认真贯彻执行安全生产和工资奖励政策。
