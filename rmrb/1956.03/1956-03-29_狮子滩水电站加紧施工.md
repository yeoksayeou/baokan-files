    Shizitan Hydropower Station Speeds Up Construction

    The Shizitan Hydropower Station project is speeding up construction and is expected to generate electricity before December of this year. The massive dam, one of the main structures, has already been connected. The pouring and lining of the flood discharge channels on both banks and the three-mile-long water diversion tunnel are mostly completed. The base of the power plant building has also been poured and is about to begin installing the turbine generator's pedestal. The 60-plus square kilometer reservoir will be able to start impounding floodwaters in April. Approximately 1.1 million cubic meters of earth and stone excavation for the entire hydropower station project has been largely completed, and the concrete pouring task has completed 84.6%.

    Currently, more than 10,000 workers on the construction site are engaged in the advanced producers movement in order to complete the hydropower station ahead of schedule, and more than 30 advanced experiences have been summarized and promoted in the movement.

    狮子滩水电站加紧施工
    狮子滩水电站工程正在加紧施工，预计今年十二月前就可发电。主体工程之一的巨大拦河坝早已衔接，两岸溢洪道和长达三里的引水隧洞的浇制和衬砌工程已完成大半，发电厂房的底部也已浇筑完成，即将开始安装水轮发电机的机座。六十多平方公里的水库，四月份就可开始拦蓄洪水。水电站整个工程的110多万土石方开挖工程已大体完成，混凝土浇制任务完成了84.6％。
    目前工地上一万多职工正为提前建成水电站，投入了先进生产者运动，并在运动中总结推广了三十多种先进经验。　（本报驻成都记者）
