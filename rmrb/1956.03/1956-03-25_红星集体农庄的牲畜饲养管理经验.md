The Red Star Collective Farm in Beijing was established in the spring of 1952. It started with only sixty-three households. Over the years, the farm has continuously developed and now includes four townships: Red Star, Si Hai, Rui He, and Shi Tai, with a total of more than 2,320 households. As the farm expanded, the number of livestock also increased. Before the autumn of 1955, the farm had a total of 239 head of livestock, and it has now increased by more than 640 head.

In the first two years, the farm was small, and there were few livestock. The lack of experience and systems for raising and managing livestock didn't seem too chaotic. However, after the expansion in the winter of 1954, with more people, more hands, and more livestock, the raising and use of livestock became chaotic. The actual number of livestock didn't match the livestock records. One team was short of grass, while another team ran out of feed. Those who went early didn't care whether the livestock were "fed and watered" before taking the easy-to-use livestock, while the bad livestock were simply not used. It was common for livestock to get injured shoulders, worn-out shoulders, or sprained legs. People also didn't bring feed when going far away, leaving the livestock hungry all day. As a result, all the livestock on the farm became skinny, "skin and bones." In the winter of 1954, 160 head of cattle contracted skin diseases due to unsanitary sheds. The villagers were very dissatisfied with the "suffering" of their livestock after joining the farm.

The farm management committee conducted a special study on this situation and decided to establish a livestock organization. At the same time, it appointed a livestock director to lead the livestock raising and management work of the whole farm and to study and formulate livestock raising and management methods. After the farm established a livestock raising and management system, it changed the past "haphazard" use of draft animals. The livestock became fatter day by day, and the number of illnesses and injuries also decreased significantly, becoming a model for livestock raising and management among agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs of Beijing in 1955.

The livestock raising and management system of the Red Star Collective Farm was established in roughly the following way:

First, a major inspection of all the livestock on the farm was carried out, and livestock registration cards were established. Cattle were branded with numbers on their horns, and other livestock were tagged with number plates. The cards were registered according to the numbers, and the cards recorded the original owner's name, the livestock's color, characteristics, habits, number and date of vaccinations, medical history, etc. Two copies of the card were made, one kept by the farm management committee and the other by the brigade headquarters. The management committee allocated various types of livestock to each team for fixed use according to the size of each team's cultivated area and selected specialized personnel to be responsible for managing the livestock, saddles, vehicles, etc. During busy farming seasons, the livestock director was responsible for allocating livestock between brigades, and the brigade leader was responsible for allocating livestock between smaller teams, based on the needs of each team.

Individual farmers using livestock for one day or less had to get approval from the team leader. For more than one day, approval had to come from the brigade. When using the livestock, it had to be unloaded and returned for feeding and watering on time. If going far away, the feeder had to be notified the night before, and the feeder was responsible for feeding and watering the livestock and bringing feed. When the livestock were returned, the feeder had to check for any problems.

The amount of feed and work points for feeders were stipulated. A feeder could feed no more than fourteen head of livestock. Feeders who fed fewer livestock because the work was lighter and the work points were less were given the responsibility of managing the crops near the livestock shed, with production contracted to them and work points given accordingly to supplement the feeder's income. In this way, the feeders had a certain amount of work and requirements, as well as reasonable compensation, so they were all able to actively find ways to feed the livestock well.

The method of raising livestock was: grass first, then feed, mix little and add frequently, the grass had to be sifted clean, and water had to be drunk slowly. Each head of livestock also had to be fed some salt every day. Feeders cleaned the bedding in the pen once a day, which not only kept the livestock shed clean but also prevented hoof rot. The feeders swept the livestock trough three times a day, and in the summer, they washed the feeding trough at least once every three days.

To ensure the health of the livestock, they could not drink dirty water. In the hot summer midday, the livestock only worked in the fields from 4:00 AM to 9:00 AM in the morning and afternoon. This greatly reduced the incidence of heatstroke and illness among the livestock.

The farm also had special feeding sheds for pregnant and weak animals, where all the pregnant female livestock and the problematic and particularly weak livestock from each team were raised separately, and the most caring feeders were assigned to take care of them. In addition, pregnant cows and donkeys, as well as calves and foals after weaning, were raised in separate sheds.

The farm had a reward and punishment system for livestock raising, use, manure accumulation, and breeding. Those who implemented the system well were commended. If livestock were slightly injured due to a lack of care, they would be criticized. Serious injuries would require them to bear the medical expenses, and death would result in compensation at a reduced price. Feeders had a quota for manure accumulation, and those who actively bred livestock were rewarded. Responsibility would be investigated for livestock abortions. The reward and punishment system effectively promoted manure accumulation and livestock breeding. This year, all the farm's feeders exceeded the manure accumulation standard. The first brigade, which exceeded the standard the most, accumulated fifty-six more cartloads of fertilizer than required, and received 672 work points as a reward. From the winter of 1954 to the present, the farm has bred twenty head of young livestock, and plans to breed even more young livestock in the future.

To exchange livestock raising and management experiences, the livestock director convened a meeting of feeders from each team on the fifth of every month to examine shortcomings, summarize experiences, and conduct criticism and commendation to improve the labor enthusiasm and raising management skills of the feeders.

As a result of establishing the system and improving the raising management work, the farm's livestock have become fatter and stronger than before. Even the two thinnest livestock in the past have been raised into good draft animals in the recuperation shed. Livestock feed has also been saved. In the past, a cow needed six pounds of bran a day, but now two pounds a day is enough. Last autumn, silage feed was also trial-produced, which will save even more concentrate feed in the future.

    红星集体农庄的牲畜饲养管理经验
    陆耀先
    北京市红星集体农庄是1952年春建立的，刚建庄的时候只有六十三户，几年来，农庄不断发展，现在包括红星、四海、瑞合、石泰等四个乡，共有2，320多户。农庄扩大了，牲畜也就增多了，1955年秋前全庄共有大小牲畜239头，目前又增加了640多头。
    前两年庄小，牲畜少，没有饲养管理牲畜的经验和制度，还不觉怎么乱。自从1954年冬扩庄以后，人多手杂牲口多，饲养使用就都乱了。实有牲口数对不上牲口账，不是这队缺草就是那队断料。早去的人不管牲口“喂饱喝足”没有，牵着好使的牲口就走，坏牲口根本无人使用。打坏牲口膀子、磨坏肩、拐了腿是常事，出远门也不带草料，让牲口一饿一整天。这样全农庄的牲口都瘦得“皮包骨”。1954年冬有160头耕牛因为棚圈不卫生，染上了皮肤病。庄员们看见自己的牲口入庄后“受罪”，很不满意。
    农庄管委会针对这种情况进行了专门研究，决定成立畜牧组织，同时指派畜牧主任专职领导全庄的牲畜饲养管理工作，研究制订出饲养管理办法。农庄建立起牲畜饲养管理制度以后，就改变了过去对耕畜的“胡拉乱使”，牲口一天天肥起来，病伤现象也显著减少，成为1955年北京市郊区农业生产合作社牲畜饲养管理的旗帜。
    红星集体农庄的牲畜饲养管理制度大体是这样建立起来的：
    首先把全庄的牲口做一次大检查，建立牲口登记卡片，牛在犄角上烫上号印，其余牲口都拴上号牌，按号登记卡片，卡片上记载着原畜主姓名和牲畜的毛色、特征、癖性、防疫注射次数和日期、病历等，卡片一式两份，分由农庄管委会和大队部保存。管委会根据各大队耕作区的大小把各类牲口分配给各队固定使用，并且选出专人负责管理牲口、鞍具、车辆等。农忙时根据各队需要情况由畜牧主任负责大队和大队之间的牲畜调拨；由大队长负责小队和小队之间的牲畜调配。
    庄员个人使用牲口，一天以内的由小队长批准，超过一天的要经过大队批准。使用的时候要按时卸、按时送回喂饮。如果出远门，要在前一天晚上通知饲养员，由饲养员负责把牲口喂饱、饮好，带上草料，送回来的时候，饲养员要检查牲口有无毛病。
    饲养员喂牲口的数量和工分都有规定，一个饲养员喂的牲口最多不超过十四头。养牲口少的饲养员因为活轻些、工分少些，就把靠近牲口棚的庄稼活包给他，按包工包产给分，补助饲养员的收入。这样饲养员都有一定的工作数量和要求，也有合理的报酬，所以都能积极想办法喂好牲口。
    饲养牲畜的办法是：先草后料，少拌勤添，草要筛净，饮水要慢。每天每头牲口还要适当喂一些盐。饲养员每天都起垫圈一次，这样不但畜棚干净，也不沤蹄；每天打扫牲口槽三次，夏季里三天至少要洗刷一次饲槽。
    为了保证牲畜健康，不能给牲口喝脏水。夏天中午炎热，牲畜上下午都是四时到九时才在地里干活。这样就大大地减少了牲口受暑生病的现象。
    农庄还专门设有孕畜、瘦弱病畜的饲养棚，把全庄怀胎的母畜和各队有毛病和特别瘦弱的牲口分别集中饲养，派最爱护牲口的饲养员精心照顾。此外对怀孕的母牛、母驴，断奶后的小牛、小骡马驹都分棚喂养。
    农庄对牲畜饲养、使用、积肥、繁殖都有奖惩制度。对执行制度好的人加以表扬，如果因为不爱护牲口，使牲口受轻伤，就要受到批评，重伤的要负担医药费，死了要折价赔偿。饲养员积肥有定额，积极繁殖牲畜的有奖励，牲畜流产要追查责任。奖惩制度有力地推动了积肥和牲畜繁殖工作。今年全庄饲养员都超额完成了积肥标准，超额最多的一大队比规定多积了五十六车肥料，受奖672个工分。1954年冬天到目前，全庄繁殖了小牲口二十头，今后还准备繁殖更多的幼畜。
    为了交流牲畜饲养管理经验，每月五日由畜牧主任召集各队饲养员开会，检查缺点，总结经验，进行批评和表扬，提高饲养员的劳动积极性和饲养管理技术。
    由于建立了制度，改进了饲养管理工作，农庄的牲口都比以前肥壮了，就连两条过去最瘦的牲口，也在休养棚养成了好役畜。牲畜饲料也节省了，过去一头牛一天六斤麸子，现在一天二斤就够了。去年秋后又试制了青贮饲料，今后可以节省更多的精料。
