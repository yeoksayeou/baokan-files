    Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai: A Batch of Factories Complete Last Month's Production Plans
    (Our newspaper reports) A batch of factories in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai exceeded their national production plans for February.
    In Beijing, the agricultural implements manufacturing factories and a group of ironworks, encouraged by the slogan of supporting the agricultural cooperation movement and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, performed particularly well in completing their production tasks. The city's 123 local state-owned and joint state-private factories producing double-wheeled double-share plows exceeded their February production target, producing 336 more double-share plows than originally planned, and breaking the daily production quota of 1,000 units by the end of February. Datong, Lianshun, Zhenxingde and other ironworks greatly reduced their scrap rates by promoting advanced operating methods.
    In Tianjin, 55 state-owned and local state-owned factories completed or exceeded their total production value plan for February. The state-owned Tianjin Steel Plant exceeded its February plans for both steel ingots and steel materials, and the quality also reached the state's stipulated standards. The five cotton textile factories under the Tianjin Textile Administration Bureau exceeded their national plans for both cotton yarn and cotton cloth. Many factories launched mass quality inspection campaigns in February, resulting in improved product quality. According to statistics from the Tianjin Municipal Textile Industry Bureau and the First and Second Light Industry Bureaus, the quality of more than 160 products, including vulcanized blue dye, twill, gabardine, towels, thermos bottles, and Xue Lian paper, improved to varying degrees compared to the past.
    In Shanghai, all 20 state-owned cotton textile factories exceeded their production value and output plans for February. In January and February this year, Shanghai's state-owned and joint state-private cotton textile factories produced more than 38,500 more bales of cotton yarn and 18.8 million more meters of cotton cloth than in the same period last year. In terms of quality, by the end of February, the quality of all cotton yarn produced by 13 state-owned cotton textile factories had reached the latest standards officially implemented by the state starting on March 1; over 98% of the cotton cloth produced by 10 state-owned cotton textile factories was first-class. The state-owned Shanghai Tobacco Industry Machinery Factory, which had already reached its 1957 production level in January, also successfully completed its February plan.
