Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 26th. According to Antara News Agency, Indonesian new cabinet Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo said on March 25th, when meeting with Antara News Agency reporters, that his new cabinet, under good cooperation, will be able to complete the government program already agreed upon by all parties.

He said that one of the most important tasks to be carried out immediately is the complete abolition of the Round Table Conference Agreement with the Netherlands. He pointed out that it is equally important to restore the rule of law and order in the country. For many years, armed bandits entrenched in many parts of the country, disrupting order, have caused great suffering to Indonesia.

Sastroamidjojo said that he has not scheduled when his government will make its first policy statement to the parliament. He said, "This requires good preparation."

    沙斯特罗阿米佐约谈新阁工作
    新华社雅加达26日电　据安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚新内阁总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约三月二十五日在接见安塔拉通讯社记者的时候说，他的新内阁在很好的合作下，将能很好地完成各党已经同意的政府纲领。
    他说马上就要进行的最重要的工作之一是全部废除同荷兰的圆桌会议协定。他指出，同样重要的是恢复国内的法治和秩序。多少年来，盘踞在国内许多地区扰乱秩序的武装匪徒使印度尼西亚受到了很大的折磨。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约说，他没有预定他的政府将在什么时候在国会发表它的第一次政策声明。他说，“这需要很好的准备。”
