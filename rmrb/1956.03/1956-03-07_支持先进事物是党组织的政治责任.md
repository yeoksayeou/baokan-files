Supporting Advanced Elements is the Political Responsibility of Party Organizations
Yin Jiasheng, Deputy Secretary of the CCP Fushun Tiger Terrace Coal Mine Committee

Recently, a major production reform has emerged at the Fushun Tiger Terrace Coal Mine: the "160-meter Specialized Team Assembly Line Coal Mining Method." This method not only doubled production efficiency but also improved safety measures; it not only improved technical operations but also improved labor organization. This mining method broke the conventions that had long dominated coal mine production and greatly promoted the advanced producer movement throughout the mine. The initiators of this major production reform were Pang Guanxiang, a worker from the Sixth Mining Area, and Zhou Guangrui, a technician. From the proposal to the trial implementation to the technical appraisal and promotion throughout the mine, it only took a little over a month. The fact that this initiative could be quickly realized and could promote the advanced producer movement throughout the mine shows that supporting advanced and new things is a major political responsibility of enterprise leadership, especially enterprise Party organizations. Whether advanced and new things can grow smoothly depends on the attitude taken by the leadership: is it vigorous support or indifference? In the past, the Fushun Tiger Terrace Coal Mine Party organization, although not indifferent to the rationalization proposals and advanced experiences of its employees, did not vigorously support them. For example, after a long period of hard work, worker Wang Weixian researched and developed a model of a dredger. When he sent this model to the relevant administrative departments requesting a technical appraisal, the appraisers did not patiently help improve it but, like accepting a new product, pointed out that there were problems here and that it would not work there. The staff of the Party organization saw this situation with their own eyes, but they did not give the appraisers sharp criticism, nor did they give the creator strong support, so that this valuable initiative could not be realized for more than a year.

The Party Central Committee's instructions on accelerating socialist construction made us realize the major responsibility of Party organizations to support advanced things. The reason why Pang Guanxiang and Zhou Guangrui's initiative could be quickly realized is inseparable from the transformation of the Party organization's leadership style. When we heard about this initiative, we immediately listened patiently to the detailed report from the initiators themselves. From the report, the Party committee realized the great significance of this advanced initiative. The Party committee immediately decided to postpone the overhaul work originally scheduled for that afternoon and discussed this initiative. While understanding the great significance of this initiative and deciding to vigorously support it, the Party committee also specifically studied and analyzed the problems and difficulties that might arise in realizing this initiative, and determined specific measures to solve these problems and overcome these difficulties. Finally, the Party committee also made a special resolution to support the realization of this initiative, and designated two Party committee members to be specifically responsible for implementing this resolution. In order to ensure the smooth realization of this initiative, in addition to instructing the enterprise to fully supply all the materials needed to realize the initiative, the Party committee also helped the Party branch of the Sixth Mining Area, where the advanced initiators were located, to carry out ideological education work inside and outside the Party, publicizing the great significance of this advanced initiative in improving production efficiency and saving manpower and financial resources, publicizing the favorable factors for realizing this initiative, and also pointing out the difficulties in realizing this initiative and the ways to overcome them, and mobilizing everyone to discuss the initiative plan. This ideologically mobilized the workers and aroused their enthusiasm. This is the reason why this initiative can be insisted on and promoted under the geological conditions of half gangue and half coal, and the morale of the employees is always high. However, to realize such a major initiative, it is not enough to just mobilize the workers; it is also necessary to mobilize relevant departments and workshops to support it together. The Party organization mobilized ventilation, transportation, materials, and electrical and mechanical units to dispatch personnel to the Sixth Mining Area for support. The live bit created by the technicians and workers of the electrical and mechanical plant increased efficiency by more than 20%, which played a great role in ensuring the realization of this initiative.

The realization of Pang Guanxiang and Zhou Guangrui's initiative immediately promoted the advanced producer movement throughout the coal mine. By mid-February, the mine's employees had submitted 1,996 major suggestions. While learning and promoting Pang Guanxiang and Zhou Guangrui's advanced coal mining method, each mining area proposed advanced methods such as "three mining and one filling" and "front and rear width simultaneous mining" according to its own characteristics and geological conditions, which can increase labor productivity by 80%-100% without increasing manpower. Ding Yishan, director of the Fifth Mining Area, proposed a major initiative to "reform the pillars," which can not only save one-third of the pit wood but, more importantly, has great significance for ensuring the safe production of the coal mine. The employees of the mechanical department also broke the outdated technical regulations - increasing the traction capacity of the ten-ton electric car by more than 30%. The management personnel of the departments and the engineering and technical personnel also became involved in the advanced producer movement and successively put forward 124 major rationalization proposals. Technician Cong Xiuyan proposed that recovering inter-section coal pillars and other coal pillars would reach more than 10 million tons. Due to the development of the advanced producer movement, the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of employees have been fully utilized. The mine's production plan for January has been fully completed ahead of schedule and overfulfilled.

    支持先进事物是党组织的政治责任
    中共抚顺老虎台煤矿委员会副书记  尹加胜
    最近，抚顺老虎台煤矿出现了一项重大的生产改革，这就是“160公尺专业工作队流水作业采煤法”。它不仅提高了一倍的生产效率，同时改善了安全措施；不仅改进了技术操作，同时也改进了劳动组织。这种采煤法打破了长久以来支配煤矿生产的常规，对整个煤矿的先进生产者运动起了巨大的推动作用。这项重大生产改革的创议者是第六采煤区工人庞观祥和技术员周广瑞。这一创议从提出到试行，到作出技术鉴定在全矿推广，一共只用了一个月多一点的时间。这项创议所以能够迅速实现，所以能够推动全矿的先进生产者运动，说明了支持先进的新鲜的事物，是企业领导上，特别是企业党组织的重大的政治责任。先进的新鲜的事物能不能顺利成长，关键就在于领导上采取什么态度，是大力支持呢？还是漠不关心？抚顺老虎台煤矿党组织，过去对职工的合理化建议和先进经验，虽然并不是漠不关心，但也没有大力支持。比如工人王维贤经过长时期的努力研究出一台挖泥机模型，当他把这个模型送到行政有关部门请求作技术鉴定的时候，鉴定的人员不是以耐心的态度帮助改进，而是像验收新产品那样，指责这个模型这里有毛病，那里也不行。党组织的工作人员亲眼看到了这种情形，并没有给鉴定人员以尖锐的批评，也没有给创造者以有力的支持，以致这件可贵的创议一年多了也不能实现。
    党中央关于加速社会主义建设的指示使我们认识到党组织支持先进事物的重大责任。庞观祥和周广瑞的创议所以能够迅速实现，是和党组织领导作风的转变分不开的。当我们听到这项创议的时候，立即耐心地听取了创议者本人的详细汇报，从汇报中，党委会认识到这项先进创议的重大意义。党委会马上决定推迟原定在当天下午讨论的检修工作，而讨论了这一创议。党委会在了解了这一创举的重大意义并决定大力支持的同时，还具体地研究和分析了实现这一创议可能发生的问题和可能碰到的困难，并确定解决这些问题和克服这些困难的具体措施，最后党委会还专门为支持这一创议的实现作了一项决议，同时指定两名党委委员具体负责执行这一决议。为了保证这一创议的顺利实现，党委会除责成企业要充分供应实现创议需要的全部物资以外，还帮助先进创议者所在的第六采煤区党支部在党内外进行思想教育工作，宣传这一先进创议对提高生产效率，节约人力财力的巨大意义，宣传实现这一创议的有利因素，同时也指出实现这一创议的困难和克服困难的办法，并发动大家讨论创议的方案。这就从思想上发动了工人群众，激发了工人群众的积极性。这个创议能够在一半矸子一半煤的地质条件下坚持推广，职工的情绪始终饱满，原因就在这里。但是，要实现这样一项重大的创议，仅仅发动了工人群众是不够的，还必须发动有关科室和车间来共同支持。党组织就发动通风、运输、材料、机电等单位调派人员到第六采煤区支援。机电场技术人员和工人创造的活头钎子，提高效率20％以上，对保证这一创议的实现有很大作用。
    庞观祥和周广瑞这一创议的实现，立即推动了整个煤矿的先进生产者运动，到2月中旬为止，全矿职工已提出重大建议1，996件。各个采煤区在学习和推广庞观祥、周广瑞先进采煤法的同时，根据自己的特点和地质条件提出了“三采一充”“前后幅同采”等先进办法，在不增加人力的条件下，可提高劳动生产率80％—100％。第五采煤区区长丁义山提出了“改革支柱”的重大创议，不仅可以节省坑木三分之一，更主要的是对保证煤矿的安全生产有重大意义。机械部门的职工，也打破了陈旧的技术规程——把十吨电车的牵引能力提高30％以上。科室管理人员和工程技术人员也卷入了先进生产者运动，先后提出重大的合理化建议124件。技术员丛秀岩提出回收段间煤柱和其他煤柱即达1，000万吨以上。由于开展了先进生产者运动，充分发挥了广大职工的积极性和创造性。全矿1月份的生产计划已全面地提前和超额完成。
