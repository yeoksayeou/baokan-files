Xinhua News Agency, Amman, March 3rd: Jordanian officials announced on the 2nd that King Hussein of Jordan has removed Lieutenant General John Bagot Glubb, a British officer, from his position as Chief of General Staff of the Jordanian Army and Commander of the "Arab Legion."

At the same time, Hussein also dismissed senior British officers such as Coghill, who served as the head of the intelligence department of the "Arab Legion." Hussein has appointed Jordanian officer Radi Annab, Glubb's former assistant, as the new commander of the "Arab Legion."

The dismissal of Glubb is considered to be the result of Jordan's decision to refuse to join the Baghdad Pact. Arab public opinion has continuously condemned Britain for interfering in Jordan's internal affairs through Glubb. Recently, Glubb used the "Arab Legion" to suppress the Jordanian people's movement against joining the Baghdad Pact.

Residents of Amman, the capital of Jordan, and the Jordanian part of Jerusalem, welcomed the decision to replace Glubb on March 2. Tens of thousands of people held demonstrations and parades in the streets of Amman, chanting slogans against Glubb.

The Jordanian authorities' action to replace Glubb was also welcomed by other Arab countries. Political figures from Arab countries sent telegrams to express their congratulations.

    约旦国王解除“阿拉伯军团”英籍司令的职务
    据新华社3日讯　安曼消息，约旦官方2日宣布，约旦国王侯赛尼已经解除了英国军官约翰·拜格特·格拉布中将所担任的约旦陆军总参谋长和“阿拉伯军团”司令的职务。
    侯赛尼同时还解除了担任“阿拉伯军团”情报处长的科格希尔等高级英国军官。侯赛尼已经任命格拉布的过去助手约旦军官拉迪·吴纳布少将为新的“阿拉伯军团”司令。
    解除格拉布的职务，被认为是约旦决定拒绝参加巴格达条约一事的结果。阿拉伯各国舆论曾经不断谴责英国通过格拉布干涉约旦的内政。最近格拉布曾利用“阿拉伯军团”镇压约旦人民反对参加巴格达条约的运动。
    约旦首都安曼和耶路撒冷约旦区的居民在3月2日都对撤换格拉布的决定表示欢迎。成千上万的群众在安曼各条街道上举行示威游行，高呼反对格拉布的口号。
    约旦当局撤换格拉布的行动也受到其他阿拉伯国家的欢迎。阿拉伯各国政界人士纷纷打电报表示祝贺。
