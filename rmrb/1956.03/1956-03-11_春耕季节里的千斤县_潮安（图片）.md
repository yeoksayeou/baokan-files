Chao'an - Thousand-Jin County in the Spring Ploughing Season

    In March, from Changbai Mountain to the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains, from the Inner Mongolia grasslands to the Qaidam Basin, from the Gobi Desert to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, countless valleys and endless fertile fields are still covered in white snow and unfrozen rivers. At the same time, Chao'an, the nation's first thousand-jin (500 kg) per mu high-yield county in southern China, is already blossoming with peach and plum flowers. The annual spring ploughing season has begun here in a timely manner. In this season full of hope, the farmers of Chao'an County, who have basically achieved semi-socialist collectivization, are responding to the call of national high-yield models Wang Hanguo and Lin Yancheng by enthusiastically launching a socialist agricultural production increase campaign, working diligently to strive for the county to reach the increased production target of 1,230 jin per mu ahead of schedule this year.

    春耕季节里的千斤县——潮安
    阳春三月，从长白山到大、小兴安岭，从内蒙古草原到柴达木盆地，从戈壁滩到青藏高原，数不尽的山谷，望不断的沃野，到处还是皑皑的白雪，未解冻的冰河。就在这同一个时间里，祖国南方的全国第一个千斤丰产县——潮安已经是桃花朵朵，李花片片。一年一度的春耕生产及时地在这里开始了。在这充满希望的季节里，基本上实现半社会主义合作化的潮安全县农民，响应全国丰产模范汪汉国、林炎城的倡议，热烈开展社会主义农业增产竞赛运动，为争取全县在今年提前达到1957年每亩1，230斤的增产指标而辛勤地劳动着。
