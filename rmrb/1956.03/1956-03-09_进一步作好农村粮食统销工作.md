    Further Improve Rural Grain Unified Purchase and Sale Work
    Since May of last year, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and local Party and government organs at all levels, a thorough rectification of the unified purchase and sale of grain in urban and rural areas has been carried out. Measures such as fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sale of grain in rural areas, and quantitative supply of grain in towns and cities have been implemented, making China's grain purchase and sale work more rational and initially institutionalized. Subsequently, the upsurge of agricultural cooperation appeared in rural areas across the country, and last year agriculture had another bumper harvest, and the grain purchase and sale situation became more stable. Therefore, on the basis of the great achievements of grain unified purchase and sale in the past two years, a very favorable situation has emerged on the grain front, the relationship between the Party and the government and the peasant masses has become closer, and the worker-peasant alliance has been further developed and consolidated.
    Despite such remarkable achievements in grain work, it must not be said that our work is perfect. At present, in the work of fixing grain production, purchase, and sale, there are still some degrees of deviation that are too high or too low; especially in some areas, the rural grain fixed sale work has not been fully completed. According to the survey and statistical materials from several provinces, the villages with more or less problems in fixed sale work generally account for about 15%; the number of households with fixed sale figures set too loosely or too tightly accounts for about 5%-10% of the total number of grain-deficient households. This is a more prominent problem in current rural grain work.
    Of course, the achievements of grain work are primary and the mainstream. In those more than ten percent of villages where the work has not been fully completed, grain work has generally progressed compared with last year; generally speaking, the grain supply in these villages will not suddenly develop into the tense situation of last spring. However, if we turn a blind eye to the problems in our work and let them be covered up by the victorious situation of the rural socialist upsurge, and fail to fully utilize the favorable objective and subjective conditions to thoroughly solve the fixed sale problems in these more than ten percent of villages, then the problems existing in the grain fixed sale work in these villages will not only not be solved, but the problems existing in the fixed production and fixed purchase aspects will also be concentrated and exposed in terms of unified sale. In this case, it is still possible for a supply shortage to occur in some areas like it did last spring. Therefore, it is fully necessary to further improve rural grain unified sale work.
    It is also entirely possible to do a better job in rural grain unified sale work. On the basis of correctly implementing the three-fixed policy, the requisition and purchase task for this grain year (July 1955 - June 1956) is expected to be overfulfilled. Grain sales have also been stable since May of last year. Grain sales in the eight months from July of last year to February of this year decreased by 21% compared with the same period last year. Although grain sales have decreased by one-fifth, the rural grain supply has been more fully guaranteed. This must be said to be a great achievement. There are still 4 months (March to June) left in this grain year. The grain sales target for these 4 months, according to the original planned grain supply figures and the subsequently approved increases, is 900 million catties more than the actual sales volume in the same period last year. Therefore, based on past experience, as long as we do our work well, not only can the grain supply to rural areas be effectively guaranteed, but there should also be a considerable surplus.
    In order to further improve grain unified sale work, Party committees at all levels must learn from the lessons of last spring and conduct a check and rectification of rural grain unified sale as early as possible based on different situations. Party committees at all levels must uniformly lead and deploy, organize necessary forces (including the work teams working in rural areas to establish cooperatives), combine the current work of rectifying agricultural production cooperatives and spring plowing production, rely on the rural Party, Communist Youth League, administrative, and cooperative organizations, mobilize the peasant masses, and fully utilize the various data of three-fixed to households to complete this work in a concentrated and swift manner within a very short period of time. In terms of specific practices, a method combining comprehensive inspection and key rectification must be adopted: for those villages and cooperatives where there are no or very few problems in grain unified sale work, on the premise of doing a good job in preparing materials, open the necessary meetings in a very short period of time, organize a certain force, divide the work, divide the areas, verify the grain shortage situation of farmers, and rationally adjust the supply objects and quantities. Those villages and cooperatives with more problems or fairly serious problems should be rectified as key points, with greater efforts and more time, mobilize the masses, verify the situation, and solve the problems. General villages should be properly arranged within a few days. For those villages where the problems are relatively serious and the grain supply is quite tense, the rectification of grain unified sale work must be taken as the central task for a certain period of time to ensure that the situation is quickly eased and the problems are thoroughly resolved.
    The principle of checking and rectifying grain unified sale work is to ensure the reasonable needs of rural areas while ensuring that the state's sales targets are not broken, while conserving grain as much as possible. This principle must be strictly observed. In this regard, two possible deviations must be prevented. One is not understanding the current real needs of farmers, but simply and mechanically adjusting the fixed sale figures according to the three-fixed data, which will not eliminate the phenomenon of fixed sale figures being too high or too low, the rural grain supply will not be effectively guaranteed, and it will affect the establishment of cooperatives and spring plowing production. The other is to regard the inspection and rectification of grain unified sale work as a purely measure to increase supplementary sales, only seeing that the current grain purchase and sale situation is generally good, the plan for the purchase-sale difference can be completed, and the sales target can also have a considerable surplus, and thinking that it does not matter if more is sold, or thinking that as long as the sales target is not broken, and thus relaxing possible savings. Such ideas and practices are also completely wrong. It must be recognized that under the principle of ensuring the reasonable needs of urban and rural people, it is beneficial to the country and the people if the state can store one more catty of grain. Therefore, the phenomenon of selling and buying more that has already begun to appear in some areas should be prevented and eliminated.
    While checking and rectifying rural grain unified sale work, all localities should conduct a sorting out of grain three-fixed data, which will help further institutionalize grain work in the future. The work of the national grain market must also be valued and developed.
    The current favorable situation on the grain front is the result of the efforts of the entire Party and the people of the whole country. However, since China's grain production is still affected by natural conditions to a considerable extent, and the demand for grain will increase under the new situation, doing a good job in grain work is still an arduous task, and we must never be complacent and must continue to forge ahead.

### 进一步作好农村粮食统销工作

    进一步作好农村粮食统销工作
    自从去年5月以来，在党中央、国务院和各级地方党政机关领导下，对城乡粮食统销工作进行了切实的整顿，实行了农村粮食定产、定购、定销和市镇粮食定量供应的措施，使我国粮食购销工作更加合理并初步走上了制度化。接着全国农村出现了农业合作化的高涨，去年农业又是丰收，粮食购销情况也更加稳定了。因此，在过去两年粮食统购统销的巨大成就的基础上，粮食战线上出现了一个很为有利的局面，党和政府同农民群众的关系更加亲密，工农联盟更加发展和巩固。
    尽管粮食工作有了这样显著的成绩，但是，绝不能说我们的工作已经十全十美了。目前在粮食定产、定购、定销工作中，还存在着某种程度的偏高偏低的现象；特别是某些地区农村粮食定销工作还没有完全做好。根据若干省份的调查统计材料来看，定销工作还存在着或多或少的问题的乡，一般约占15％左右；定销数字规定得偏宽偏紧的户数，约占缺粮总户数的
  5％—10％。这是目前农村粮食工作中较为突出的问题。
    当然，粮食工作的成绩是主要的，是主流。在那些工作还没有完全作好的百分之十几的乡中，粮食工作和去年比较也普遍有了进步；一般地说，这些乡的粮食供应，决不至于突然发展成为去年春季那样紧张的局面。但是，如果我们对工作中的毛病熟视无睹，让它被农村社会主义高潮的胜利形势掩盖起来，而不充分利用主客观的有利条件，把这百分之十几的乡的定销问题加以彻底的解决，那么，这些乡的粮食定销工作中存在的问题不仅不能解决，定产、定购方面存在的问题也将集中从统销方面暴露出来。在这种情形下，在部分地区出现像去年春季那样供应紧张的现象仍然是可能的。因此，进一步做好农村粮食统销工作是有充分必要的。
    把农村粮食统销工作做得更好也是完全可能的。在正确贯彻三定政策的基础上，本粮食年度（1955年7月—1956年6月）的征购任务预计是可能超额完成的。粮食销量从去年5月以来，也一直是平稳的。从去年7月到今年2月8个月的销量，比上年度同期减少了21％。粮食销量虽然下降了五分之一，农村粮食供应却得到了更充分的保证。这不能不说是一个很大的成绩。本粮食年度还有4个月（3至6月）时间，这4个月的粮食销售指标，按照原定粮食供应计划数字和后来批准增加的数字，比去年同期实销量多9亿斤。因此，根据过去的经验，我们只要做好工作，不但供应农村的粮食可以有切实保证，而且还应该有不少结余。
    为了进一步做好粮食统销工作，各级党委必须接受去年春季的教训，及早地根据不同的情况，对农村粮食统销进行一次检查和整顿。各级党委必须统一领导和部署，组织必要的力量（包括在农村办社的工作组），结合当前整顿农业生产合作社的工作和春耕生产工作，依靠农村党、团、行政和合作社的组织，发动农民群众，充分运用三定到户的各种资料，在一个很短的时间内，全力突击完成这项工作。在具体作法上，必须采取全面检查和重点整顿相结合的方法：对那些粮食统销工作没有什么问题或者问题很小的乡和社，在做好资料准备工作的条件下，在极短的时间内，开好必要的会议，组织一定的力量，分工、分片查实农民缺粮情况，合理调整供应的对象和数量。对那些问题较多或者问题相当严重的乡和社，应作为重点加以整顿，用更大的力量和较多的时间，发动群众，查实情况，解决问题。一般的乡应在几天以内安排妥善。对那些问题比较严重，粮食供应表现的相当紧张的乡，必须在一定的时间内，把整顿粮食统销工作作为中心工作来做，保证迅速地把情况缓和下来，使问题得到彻底的解决。
    检查和整顿粮食统销工作的原则，是在保证国家销售指标不被突破的前提下，既要切实保证农村的合理需要，又要尽可能节约粮食。这个原则必须严格遵守。在这方面必须防止两种可能发生的偏向。一种是不了解农民当前真实的需要情况，只是单纯地机械地根据三定资料来调整定销数字，这样就不能消除定销数字偏高偏低的现象，农村的粮食供应就得不到切实保证，就会影响办社和春耕生产。另一种是把检查和整顿粮食统销工作当作是单纯的增补销量的措施，只看到目前粮食购销情况一般很好，收销差额的计划能够完成，销售指标也能剩余不少，就认为多销一点不要紧，或者认为只要不突破销售指标就行，因而放松了可能的节约。这样的想法和作法，也是完全错误的。必须认识，在保证城乡人民合理需要的原则下，国家若能多存一斤粮食，对国家和人民都是有利的。因此，对于某些地区已经开始显露的多销多卖的现象，应该加以防止和消除。
    在检查和整顿农村粮食统销工作的同时，各地应该对粮食三定资料进行一次整理，这对今后粮食工作的进一步制度化是有帮助的。国家粮食市场的工作，也必须加以重视，使之开展起来。
    目前粮食战线上的有利形势，是全党和全国人民努力的结果。但是，由于我国的粮食生产暂时还在不小的程度上受自然条件的影响，而对粮食的需要在新的形势下又将有所增加，因此，做好粮食工作，仍然是一项艰巨的任务，我们绝对不能麻痹大意，必须继续奋发前进。
