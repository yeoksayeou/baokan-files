Eliminating illiteracy on a nationwide scale in a planned and systematic way, enabling the broad masses of working people to shed their illiteracy and acquire modern culture, is a major cultural revolution in our country and an extremely important political task in the country's socialist construction. As Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out: "Eliminating illiteracy from 80% of the population is an important task of the new China." At present, in coordination with the development of socialist industrialization and agricultural cooperation, it is very necessary and possible to vigorously carry out the movement to eliminate illiteracy in order to basically eliminate illiteracy nationwide within five or seven years. The improvement of the lives of workers and peasants has prepared favorable prerequisites for them to learn culture. At the same time, in the process of socialist industrialization and agricultural cooperation, workers and peasants urgently demand to learn culture due to the needs of developing production. With collective strength, farmers who have organized cooperatives can organize themselves to learn culture. In order to complete this arduous historical task during the country's socialist industrialization and agricultural cooperation, the following decisions are now made:

I. Starting from 1956, literacy education must be vigorously carried out among workers and peasants in close connection with the development of national socialist industrialization and agricultural cooperation. It is required that all localities, in accordance with their local conditions, basically eliminate illiteracy within five or seven years. It is required to eliminate illiteracy among government cadres within two to three years; to eliminate illiteracy among approximately 95% of workers in factories, mines, and enterprises within three to five years; and to basically eliminate illiteracy among rural and urban residents within five to seven years, that is, to eliminate illiteracy reaching over 70%. In ethnic minority areas and areas with particularly difficult conditions, the plan and pace of eliminating illiteracy should be determined based on specific circumstances. The task of eliminating illiteracy in rural areas is particularly arduous, which requires all localities to organize greater and more forces to carry out this work, but the work of eliminating illiteracy in government agencies and factories and mines must not be relaxed as a result. The target of eliminating illiteracy is mainly people aged fourteen to fifty, and illiterate people over fifty years old should be welcomed to participate in learning if they are willing to learn to read. Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, cadres, youth, and activists on all construction fronts should consciously and actively participate in learning as soon as possible and shed their illiteracy.

II. Literacy education must implement the principle of "linking with reality and learning for application." In rural areas, the teaching content should be from near to far. The first step should meet the most pressing needs of current agricultural cooperation, that is, the need for recording work points, teaching the names of people, place names, cooperative names, tool names, farm work names, crop names, numerals, quantifiers, and other urgently needed words in the village and township, about two to three hundred words. This kind of textbook should be compiled by local intellectuals under the guidance and assistance of cadres guiding cooperative work, based on the needs of their own cooperatives. Each place compiles its own book, and it is not necessary to send it to the education administrative department for review. The second step is to expand the teaching content to focus on common things and commonly used words in the county or special district, plus some common things and commonly used words in the province and the whole country, also only a few hundred words. This kind of textbook should be edited by local intellectuals organized by the county or prefectural commissioner's office, with the assistance and guidance of cadres guiding cooperative work, and quickly reviewed by the education administrative organs at the prefectural or provincial level. The third step is to expand the teaching content to focus on common things and commonly used words in the province, plus a portion of common things and commonly used words nationwide, about a few hundred words. This kind of textbook is edited by the education departments and bureaus of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government. The requirement for literacy education is to complete these three kinds of textbooks, recognize about 1,500 words, be able to roughly understand simple and popular newspapers and periodicals, be able to keep simple accounts, write simple notes, and be able to do simple abacus calculations. All localities should compile these three kinds of textbooks in the first half of 1956 according to the above principles and steps for the masses to learn. The education departments and bureaus of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government should first guide a cooperative and a county to compile demonstration textbooks. The literacy textbooks used by workers can adopt the literacy textbooks published by the People's Education Press. Factories and mines with conditions can also compile their own literacy textbooks or supplementary teaching materials in light of the needs of industrial production and workers' lives. The literacy standard for workers is around 2,000 words.

III. To carry out literacy education, it is necessary to implement "teaching each other among the people" and mobilize literate people to teach illiterate people. It is impossible to eliminate illiteracy by relying on full-time teachers. Literate people in factories, mines, rural areas, and urban residents, school teachers, students in schools above senior elementary school, staff of state organs and people's organizations, local troops, etc., should be widely mobilized to participate in the work of eliminating illiteracy. Teaching people to read is an extremely glorious task and a concrete manifestation of serving the working people. All literate people should actively participate in this work without shirking their responsibility. Teachers in schools at all levels should undertake the task of assisting part-time teachers in teaching in the work of eliminating illiteracy. For part-time teachers participating in literacy education, they should be constantly encouraged to increase their sense of honor in serving the masses; at the same time, effective measures should be taken to give them necessary training and education to improve their cultural and professional level. The government should give appropriate rewards to those who have made significant achievements in the work of eliminating illiteracy.

IV. Government agencies, factories, mines, enterprises, agricultural and handicraft production cooperatives should actively organize literacy education and vigorously organize illiterate workers, peasants, and cadres to participate in learning. Urban street committees should also actively carry out literacy education among urban residents. All government agencies, factories, mines, enterprises, agricultural and handicraft production cooperatives, townships (villages), and urban street committees should include specific plans for eliminating illiteracy in the overall plan of their units or regions and strengthen management to eliminate illiteracy quickly and effectively.

V. Organizing the masses to learn to read must adhere to the principle of voluntariness, and coercion is not allowed. It is necessary to carry out extensive and in-depth publicity and mobilization work among the broad masses of workers and peasants to make them consciously and voluntarily participate in learning. It is wrong to fail to carry out publicity and mobilization and adopt a laissez-faire attitude in the movement to eliminate illiteracy.

VI. To complete the task of eliminating illiteracy, it is necessary to ensure the learning time for those participating in literacy learning. Party organizations and administrative departments of government agencies, factories, mines, enterprises, cooperatives, townships (villages), and urban street committees must reduce unnecessary meetings and arrange spare time in a unified and rational manner. In government agencies, factories, mines, and enterprises, it is required to ensure that those participating in literacy learning have at least six hours of learning time per week and at least 240 hours of learning time per year. In rural areas, it should be advocated to adhere to year-round learning. In addition to seizing winter learning, learning should also be adhered to in the other three seasons, requiring at least 240 hours of learning time per year. The spare-time learning of farmers should be adapted to the busy and slack seasons of farming. The learning time and progress should be adjusted according to the different situations of the farming seasons. It is necessary to advocate the practice of "learn more when not busy, learn less when slightly busy, and take a break from school when very busy."

VII. Literacy teaching must adopt a variety of organizational forms, adapt to people, adapt to time, and use flexibly. For government cadres, workers, farmers with better learning conditions, and citizens, class teaching can be used more. For people who are not easy to concentrate on learning, group forms can be used, and class teaching cannot be emphasized. Individual teaching can also be used for people with particularly poor learning conditions. Generally, farmers can concentrate on attending spare-time schools in winter, and after spring plowing, they can be organized into groups for learning in conjunction with production.

VIII. For workers and peasants who have completed literacy education, they should be helped to consolidate their existing achievements, and they should be constantly encouraged and guided to practice using words and calculations. On the basis of running literacy education well, spare-time primary schools for workers and peasants should be actively organized to absorb workers and peasants who have completed literacy education to continue learning as much as possible and raise their cultural level to the equivalent of primary school graduation. The education administrative organs will formulate separately the academic system, curriculum, and development plan for spare-time primary schools. Propaganda organs, cultural publishing organs, and other relevant departments at all levels should organize forces to edit and publish a large number of newspapers, periodicals, and books for literate workers and peasants to read. The content of these reading materials should be appropriate, the language should be popular, and it must meet the level and requirements of workers and peasants. It is necessary to vigorously improve the distribution of books and newspapers and distribute books and newspapers to workers and peasants in a timely manner, and special attention should be paid to sending popular books and newspapers to the countryside. Publishing organs must first ensure the timely supply of sufficient literacy textbooks.

Cultural organs in various places, such as cultural centers (stations), libraries (rooms), clubs, etc., should actively help carry out the work of eliminating illiteracy and mass spare-time cultural learning, and regard this work as an important task of their own.

IX. Eliminating illiteracy is an arduous political task. The Communist Party of China and the people's government at all levels must fully value this work, include it in their work agenda, strengthen their leadership over it, and widely mobilize and organize forces from all sides to participate in this work. It is necessary to formulate phased plans for eliminating illiteracy in the whole province, the whole autonomous region, the whole city, the whole special district, the whole county, the whole district, the whole township, and the whole factory and mine enterprise in accordance with this decision and in combination with local conditions; and to continuously revise their plans based on the development of actual work. The people's committees of all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions must report their plans for eliminating illiteracy to the State Council in the second quarter of 1956. Party committees and governments at all levels must regularly check the implementation of the plans, summarize experiences, overcome shortcomings, and ensure the smooth completion of this task. Places and cadres where there are still passive and conservative sentiments in the work of eliminating illiteracy must immediately correct their mistakes. Education administrative organs at all levels must effectively manage the work of eliminating illiteracy, and they must manage it well. For this reason, it is necessary to strengthen and replenish industrial and agricultural spare-time education institutions and equip them with a certain number and quality of cadres to be responsible for this work. The cultural, educational, and health committees of townships (villages) and urban street committees should include the work of eliminating illiteracy as one of the basic tasks of the current cultural and educational work. Propaganda and education cadres of government agencies, factories, mines, enterprises, agricultural and handicraft cooperatives must actively and responsibly do this work well. If the propaganda and education cadres of factories, mines, enterprises, agricultural and handicraft production cooperatives, townships (villages), and street committees, and the cultural, educational, and health committees of townships (villages) and urban street committees are not sound enough, they must be strengthened to ensure that they can be responsible for managing the work of eliminating illiteracy. Organizations such as trade unions, the Communist Youth League, and women's federations at all levels, and the departments of the people's committees at all levels in charge of industrial and agricultural production, must take various effective measures to assist the Party and the government in carrying out the work of eliminating illiteracy. In particular, the Communist Youth League should play an active pioneering role in the movement to eliminate illiteracy. Education administrative organs, trade unions, the Communist Youth League, women's federations, and other relevant parties at all levels should unite to organize associations for eliminating illiteracy, absorb the broad masses of intellectuals, people from all walks of life, and all literate people to participate, and actively assist the government in carrying out the work of eliminating illiteracy.

Eliminating illiteracy is a broad mass education movement. Propaganda, education, culture, and other relevant organs in various places should vigorously carry out publicity and mobilization, mobilize forces from all sides, and strive to achieve the task of eliminating illiteracy.

    中国共产党中央委员会、中华人民共和国国务院
    关于扫除文盲的决定
    在全国范围内积极地有计划有步骤地扫除文盲，使广大劳动人民摆脱文盲状态，具有现代的文化，这是我国文化上的一个大革命，也是国家进行社会主义建设中的一项极为重大的政治任务。正如毛泽东主席所指示的：“从80％的人口中扫除文盲，是新中国的一项重要工作。”在目前，配合着社会主义工业化和农业合作化的发展，大张旗鼓地开展扫除文盲运动，以求在五年或者七年内基本上扫除全国文盲，这是非常必要的，也是可能实现的。工农群众生活的改善，已经为他们学习文化准备了有利的前提。同时，在社会主义工业化和农业合作化的过程中，工农群众由于发展生产的需要，也迫切地要求学习文化。农民组织了合作社，有了集体的力量，他们就可以自己组织学习文化。为了必须在国家的社会主义工业化和农业合作化的过程中努力完成这个艰巨的历史任务，现在作如下决定：
    一、从1956年开始，必须密切地结合着国家的社会主义工业化和农业合作化的发展，在工农群众中大力开展识字教育。要求各地按照当地情况，在五年或者七年内基本上扫除文盲。要求二年到三年扫除机关干部中的文盲；三年或者五年扫除工厂、矿山、企业职工中的文盲95％左右；五年或者七年基本上扫除农村和城市居民中的文盲，就是说要扫除文盲达到70％以上。在少数民族地区和条件特殊困难的地区，应该根据具体情况确定扫除文盲的计划和速度。农村扫除文盲的任务特别艰巨，这就要求各地组织更大和更多的力量来进行这方面的工作，但是，决不能因此放松了在机关和厂矿中扫除文盲的工作。扫除文盲的对象以十四岁到五十岁的人为主，超过五十岁的文盲如果愿意识字，应该欢迎他们参加学习。共产党员、青年团员、干部、青年和各个建设战线上的积极分子中的文盲，应该自觉地积极地尽先参加学习，摆脱文盲状态。
    二、识字教育必须贯彻执行“联系实际，学以致用”的原则。在农村，教学内容应该由近及远。第一步，应该适应当前农业合作化最迫切的需要，即记工的需要，教学本村本乡的人名、地名、合作社名、工具名、农活名、庄稼名、数词、量词和其他急切需用的语词，大约两三百个字。这种课本应该由指导合作化工作的干部指导和帮助当地的知识分子，各就自己那里的合作社的需要去编。每处自编一本，不必送教育行政部门审查。第二步，把教学内容扩大到以本县或者本专区的常见事物和常用语词做中心，加上一些本省和全国性的常见事物和常用语词，也只要几百个字。这种课本应该由县或者专署组织当地的知识分子编辑，请指导合作化工作的干部协助和指导，由专署级或者省级的教育行政机关迅速加以审查。第三步，再把教学内容扩大到以本省的常见事物和常用语词做中心，加上一部分全国性的常见事物和常用语词，大约几百个字。这种课本由省、自治区、直辖市的教育厅、局编辑。识字教育的要求，就是要学完这三种课本，大约认识一千五百个字，能够大体上看懂浅近通俗的报刊、能够记简单的账，写简单的便条，并且会做简单的珠算。各地应该根据上述的原则和步骤，在1956年上半年编出这三种课本，以便群众学习。省、自治区、直辖市的教育厅、局应该先指导一个合作社和一个县编出示范课本。工人识字所用的课本，可以采用人民教育出版社出版的识字课本，有条件的工厂、矿山，也可以结合工业生产和工人生活的需要，自编识字课本或者补充教材。工人的识字标准是二千个字左右。　
    三、开展识字教育，必须实行“以民教民”，发动识字的人教不识字的人。依靠专职教师来扫除文盲的做法是不可能的。应该广泛地动员厂矿、农村、城市居民中识字的人，学校教师，高级小学以上学校的学生，国家机关和人民团体的工作人员，当地驻军等，都来参加扫除文盲的工作。教人识字是一项极其光荣的任务，是为劳动人民服务的一种具体表现。凡是识字的人都应该义不容辞地积极地参加这项工作。各级学校的教师在扫除文盲的工作中应该担负起辅导业余教师进行教学的任务。对于参加识字教育的业余教师，应该经常地鼓励他们，增长他们为群众服务的光荣感；同时应该采取有效的办法，给以必要的训练和教育，提高他们的文化和业务水平。对于扫除文盲的工作有显著成绩的人，政府应该给以适当的奖励。
    四、机关、厂矿企业、农业和手工业生产合作社都应该积极举办识字教育，大力地组织工农干部、工农群众中的文盲参加学习。城市街道也应该在城市居民中积极开展识字教育。各机关、厂矿企业、农业和手工业生产合作社、乡（村）、城市街道都应该把扫除文盲的具体计划列入本单位或者本地区的全面规划里面，并且切实地加强管理，以便迅速和有效地扫除文盲。
    五、组织群众识字，必须坚持自愿的原则，不许强迫命令。要广泛地深入地向广大工农群众进行宣传鼓动的工作，使他们自觉自愿地参加学习。在开展扫除文盲的运动中，不进行宣传鼓动，采取放任自流的态度，那是错误的。
    六、要完成扫除文盲的任务，必须保证参加识字学习的人的学习时间。机关、工矿企业、合作社、乡（村）、城市街道的党组织和行政方面都必须减少不必要的会议，统一合理地安排业余时间。在机关、工厂、矿山和企业中，要求保证参加识字学习的人每周至少有六小时的学习时间，每年至少有240小时的学习时间。在农村中，应该提倡坚持常年学习，除了抓紧冬季学习以外，其他三季也要坚持学习，要求每年至少有240小时的学习时间。农民的业余学习应该和农事的忙闲相适应，学习的时间和进度，应该根据农事季节的不同情况，因时制宜，有所伸缩，要提倡“不忙多学，小忙少学，大忙放学”的做法。
    七、识字教学必须采用多种多样的组织形式，因人制宜，因时制宜，灵活运用。对于机关干部、工人、学习条件较好的农民和市民，可以较多地采用班级教学。对于不容易集中学习的人，可以采用小组形式，不能强调班级教学。对于学习条件特别差的人，还可以采用个别教学。一般农民，冬季可以较多地集中到业余学校上学，春耕以后可以结合生产组织编成小组进行学习。
    八、对于受完识字教育的工农群众，要帮助他们巩固已有的成绩，经常鼓励和指导他们练习使用文字和计算。还应该在办好识字教育的基础上，积极举办工农业余小学，尽可能地吸收受完识字教育的工农群众继续学习，把他们的文化水平提高到相当于小学毕业的程度。关于业余小学的学制、课程和发展计划，由教育行政机关另外制定。各级宣传机关、文化出版机关和其他有关部门都应该组织力量，编辑出版大量的报刊图书，供给识字的工农群众阅读。这些读物内容要适当，文字要通俗，务必切合工农群众的程度和要求。要大力改进书报的发行工作，及时地把书报发行到工农群众中去，特别要注意输送通俗书报下乡。出版机关必须首先保证及时供应足够的识字课本。
    各地的文化机关，如文化馆（站）、图书馆（室）、俱乐部等，都应该积极地帮助开展扫除文盲和群众业余文化学习的工作，并且把这一工作作为自己的一项重要任务。
    九、扫除文盲是一个艰巨的政治任务，中国共产党和人民政府的各级组织必须充分重视这一工作，把它列入自己的工作日程，加强对它的领导，广泛地动员和组织各方面的力量来参加这一工作。必须遵照本决定，结合当地情况制定出全省的、全自治区的、全市的、全专区的、全县的、全区的、全乡的、全厂矿企业的扫除文盲的分期实行的规划；并且要根据实际工作的发展情况，不断地修正自己的规划。各省、市、自治区人民委员会必须在1956年第二季度内把自己的扫除文盲规划报告国务院。各级党委和政府必须定期地检查计划的执行情况，总结经验，克服缺点，以保证这一工作任务的顺利完成。对于扫除文盲的工作还存在着消极保守情绪的地方和干部必须立即纠正错误。各级教育行政机关必须把扫除文盲的工作切实地管起来，并且必须管好。为此，就必须加强和充实工农业余教育机构，配备一定数量和质量的干部负责这方面的工作。乡（村）、城市街道的文教卫生委员会应该把扫除文盲的工作列为当前文教工作的基本任务之一。机关、厂矿企业、农业和手工业合作社的宣传教育干部必须积极负责地办好这件事情。厂矿企业、农业和手工业生产合作社、乡（村）、街道的宣传教育干部和乡（村）、城市街道的文教卫生委员会如果不够健全，必须予以加强，务必使它们能够负责管理起扫除文盲的工作。各级工会、青年团、妇联等组织，各级人民委员会有关工农业生产的管理部门，都必须采取各种有效办法，协助党和政府开展扫除文盲的工作。尤其是青年团，应该在扫除文盲的运动中起积极的先锋作用。各级教育行政机关、工会、青年团、妇联和其他有关方面，应该联合起来组织扫除文盲协会，吸收广大知识分子、社会人士和一切识字的人参加，积极地协助政府开展扫除文盲工作。
    扫除文盲是一个广大的群众教育运动，各地宣传、教育、文化等有关机关都应该大张旗鼓地进行宣传鼓动，动员各方面的力量，来为实现扫除文盲的任务而奋斗。　1956年3月29日
