The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China formulated the "Shanghai Intellectuals Work Outline for 1956-1957," which was discussed and revised at the intellectuals issue conference held from February 18 to March 9.

The outline states that we should earnestly establish a comrade relationship of mutual trust and close proximity between Party organizations at all levels, state organ staff, and intellectuals, and regularly care for and actively support the scientific research and professional activities of intellectuals. Leading cadres of Party organizations at all levels should maintain regular contact with senior intellectuals, and major matters related to their work must be discussed together in advance. Party organizations should invite some politically progressive intellectuals to attend relevant Party working meetings as non-voting participants.

The outline proposes methods to ensure that senior intellectuals have at least six-fifths of their workdays dedicated to professional work: experts and scholars should not hold more than one concurrent social position, and administrative positions concurrently held by experts and scholars should be relieved as much as possible; when concurrent positions are necessary, capable administrative assistants should be assigned. Relevant units should effectively improve leadership methods, improve work systems, streamline unnecessary meetings, and make specific plans to ensure that experts and scholars have sufficient time for professional activities.

In order to fully provide reference materials for scientific research, the outline stipulates that starting in the first half of this year, a library of philosophy and social sciences, a medical library, and a research institute for traditional Chinese medicine literature will be established successively. Within 1957, a museum of history and a museum of natural history will each be established. In addition, a science and technology book publishing house, a medical and health book publishing house, a reprint book publishing house for foreign language books, a science education chart publishing house, and a music publishing house will also be established. In order to improve the level of scientific research in universities and colleges and to carry out academic discussions, universities and colleges should run academic journals well. This year, in addition to the journals already published by Fudan University and East China Normal University, Jiaotong University, Tongji University, and other universities should successively start academic journals, and all universities and colleges in the city should run a good academic journal by next year. In the first half of this year, a club suitable for senior intellectuals to conduct scientific and cultural activities will also be established to hold academic lectures, exchange professional experiences, enrich cultural life, and regularly hold science reports to cadres. The State-owned Industry Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China should, together with relevant departments, begin to inspect the current confidentiality system of factories in the first half of the year, and formulate methods that are both conducive to confidentiality and conducive to scientific research, production internships, and other work. A plan for experts and scholars to borrow confidential materials will be drafted.

The outline also made some provisions for improving the living standards of intellectuals and protecting the health of experts and scholars. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has recently decided to allocate a number of houses to experts and scholars whose work and health are affected by overcrowded housing. Care measures have also been stipulated for the transportation problems of elderly, frail, and overworked experts.

The outline stipulates that the Shanghai Regional Academic Committee of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which is about to be established, will be the center for formulating the city's scientific research work plan, strengthening the connection and cooperation between the various research institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai and the universities and colleges and industrial sectors in Shanghai, promoting scientific research work in the Shanghai region, and gradually forming a regional scientific work network. In the first half of this year, the academic work committee (preparatory committee has been established) for philosophy and social sciences in the Shanghai region will be established to promote scientific research and academic discussions in philosophy, economics, history, education, law, language, literature, art, and international issues. This year, a Traditional Chinese Medicine Continuing Education College will also be established, and preparations for the Shanghai Branch of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Institute will begin, to be completed in 1957.

The outline stipulates that relevant departments in the city should, starting this year, formulate 2-year, 7-year, and 12-year plans for cultivating and improving assistant researchers, lecturers, physicians, engineers, writers, etc., using the method of each famous old expert leading 5 to 10 apprentices. Starting in the first half of this year, necessary auxiliary personnel will be gradually assigned to experts and scholars in their work. Party organizations in enterprises, schools, hospitals, government agencies, and mass organizations should, in the first half of the year, inspect the situations of senior intellectuals being employed in fields unrelated to their expertise, holding positions without responsibilities, and the accumulation of talent, and put forward specific opinions for resolution. Before June of this year, a survey of unemployed senior intellectuals with working ability should be conducted throughout the city, and appropriate arrangements should be made according to their abilities and the needs of the country.

The outline proposes to hold a city-wide science and technology invention exhibition, organize local appraisal work, and give honorary and material rewards to intellectuals who have made significant contributions. And strengthen the leadership of intellectuals' political and professional studies, organize them to visit various socialist construction projects in the country, and hold Marxist-Leninist night universities. In addition, the outline also made specific provisions for Party building work and the cultivation, education, and improvement of general intellectuals.

This outline is prepared to be submitted to the Second Plenary Session of the First Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Shanghai Municipal Committee, which will be held soon, to widely solicit opinions. (Xinhua News Agency)

    纲要提出了保证高级知识分子每周至少有六分之五的工作日用于业务的办法：专家、学者的社会兼职不超过一职，尽可能解除专家、学者兼任的行政职务，必须兼时，也应配备得力的行政副手。各有关单位应当切实改善领导方法，改进工作制度，精简不必要的会议，做出具体计划，保证专家、学者有充足的业务活动时间。

    纲要在改善知识分子生活待遇和保护专家、学者的健康方面也作了若干规定。中共上海市委员会已在最近决定拨出一批房屋给因住屋过小而影响工作和健康的专家、学者。对年老体弱、工作繁重的专家的交通问题，也规定了照顾办法。
    纲要规定以即将成立的中国科学院上海地区学术委员会为中心，制定全市科学研究的工作规划，加强中国科学院在上海的各研究所和上海的高等学校、产业部门的联系合作，推进上海地区的科学研究工作，逐步地形成地区科学工作网。在今年上半年内将成立上海地区哲学、社会科学的学术工作委员会（筹委会已成立），推动哲学、经济学、史学、教育学、法学、语言、文学、艺术和国际问题等方面的科学研究和学术讨论。今年还要成立中医进修学院，开始筹建中医研究院上海分院，在1957年建成。
    纲要规定全市各有关部门应从今年开始，以著名的老专家每人带5个至10个徒弟的办法，分别制定培养和提高助理研究员、讲师、医师、工程师、作家等2年、7年、12年计划。从今年上半年开始，将逐步给专家、学者配备工作上必要的辅助人员。各企业、学校、医院、机关、群众团体的党组织，应在上半年内检查高级知识分子用非所学、有职无事、人材积压等情况，提出具体解决的意见。今年6月前，要在全市调查有工作能力的失业高级知识分子情况，按照他们的能力和国家的需要，给以适当安排。
