In February, Comrade Chen Xia, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Wenzhou Prefectural Committee of Zhejiang Province, and others went to the Baisha Township of Pingyang County to inspect work. From the report of Comrade Zheng Yuanfu, the township's Party branch secretary, it could be seen that the branch's leadership in the agricultural cooperative movement was active, enthusiastic, and bold, and had done a lot of work. However, on the other hand, it also revealed that there were still many problems in the current cooperative work in Baisha Township, and some of the problems were quite serious. However, Comrade Zheng Yuanfu could not see the problems in the work. When Comrade Chen Xia asked, "What other problems are there in the cooperatives?" Comrade Zheng Yuanfu replied very simply, "There are no problems anymore."

That evening, Comrade Chen Xia held a symposium for activists. At first, some people said, "There are no major problems."

"Are the members' private vegetable gardens enough?" Because it had already been discovered in the morning's report by the branch secretary that the handling of private vegetable garden land was inappropriate, Comrade Chen Xia asked this question.

"Not enough, not enough! Cao Chengxuan's family of eighteen only kept two hundred vegetable plots (about one fen of land). Don't even talk about eating vegetables, even eating mud wouldn't last long. I think such households are not isolated cases," a poor peasant member replied.

"If the vegetables grown by themselves are not enough to eat, what will happen in the future?" a cadre asked.

"The cooperative's cadres have already said that the cooperative will uniformly grow vegetables and distribute them to the members according to the size of the population," everyone replied.

"Do the members whose private plots have been taken away have any opinions?"

"Yes, there are opinions, there are opinions." Then, everyone began to calculate the accounts in detail. At this time, someone said such a thing: "The Tangping production team has a total of thirty-five households, and six households have opinions on the private land. Among them, one household is a military family with a total of nine people, and they were only allowed to keep one hundred and eighty vegetable plots, and the other one hundred and fifty plots were taken out and distributed to others. This military family is very dissatisfied with this practice."

In this symposium, it was also found that the cooperative's handling of mountain forests, especially the issue of tea trees joining the cooperative, was not reasonable enough, and the compensation given to the original owners was too low, and the members also had many opinions.

The next morning, Comrade Chen Xia convened a cadre meeting and first reported on the situation of the activist symposium held the previous night. The report showed that Baisha Township still had problems in implementing the Party's cooperative policy and in formulating the agricultural production cooperative's production increase measures and production management. Comrade Chen Xia expressed his opinion: "Now, spring plowing and production are very urgent, and sowing will begin soon; if we are only satisfied with the existing achievements and do not quickly solve the current problems, the production increase plan will be in danger of falling through, and the cooperative cannot be run well. Leading cadres at all levels should clear their minds!"

The masses' reactions and Comrade Chen Xia's opinions made Comrade Zheng Yuanfu, the branch secretary, begin to clear his mind. He said, "I have learned a lot in the past two days. Yesterday, I thought there were no problems, last night I thought there seemed to be problems, and today I hear that there are many problems." That night, Comrade Zheng Yuanfu took his notebook and went to the Pingta production team to hold a symposium with members to solicit their opinions.

It can be seen from this incident how urgently the grassroots organizations need the concrete help of leading cadres. Leading cadres at all levels should frequently go deep into the grassroots organizations and strengthen the concrete leadership of the grassroots organizations.

    有没有问题

    二月间，中共浙江省温州地委副书记陈侠同志等到平阳县柏社乡检查工作。从这个乡的支部书记郑元阜同志所汇报的情况中可以看出，支部对农业合作化运动的领导是积极、热情和大胆的，做了不少工作；但是，另一方面也暴露出柏社乡当前的合作化工作中还有不少问题，有些问题还是比较严重的。可是，郑元阜同志却看不见工作中的问题。当陈侠同志问：“合作社里面，还有些什么问题？”郑元阜同志很干脆地回答说：“没有什么问题了。”
    当天晚上，陈侠同志召开了积极分子座谈会，开始，还有人说：“没有大问题。”
    “社员的自留菜园够不够呢？”因为在上午支部书记的汇报中，已经发现自留菜园地的处理不妥当，所以，陈侠同志这样问。
    “不够，不够！曹成宣全家十八个人，只留了二百株菜园地（约一分地），不要说吃菜，就是吃泥也不用多长时间就吃光了。像这样的户，我看还不是个别的。”一个贫农社员这样回答。
    “自己种的菜不够吃，以后怎么办呢？”一个干部问。
    “合作社的干部已经讲过，由合作社统一种菜，按人口多少分配给社员。”大家都这样回答。
    “自留园地被抽出去的社员，有没有意见？”
    “有意见、有意见”。接着，大家就具体地算开了账。这时，有人说出了这样一件事情“塘坪生产队，共有三十五户，对自留土地有意见的六户。中间有一户是军属，全家九口人，只给他留了一百八十株菜园地，另外的一百五十株地抽出来分给了别人。这家军属对这种做法很不满意。”
    在这个座谈会中，还发现了合作社对山林、特别是对茶树入社问题的处理不够合理，给原主的报酬过低，社员也有不少意见。
    第二天上午，陈侠同志召开干部会议，首先将昨天晚上召开积极分子座谈会的情况作了汇报。汇报的情况说明，柏社乡在贯彻执行党的合作化政策，在制定农业生产合作社的增产措施和生产管理上，都还有问题。陈侠同志发表了意见：“现在，春耕生产很紧迫，很快就要播种；如果只满足于现有的成绩，不迅速解决当前的问题，增产计划就有落空的危险，合作社就不可能办好。各级领导干部应该把头脑放清醒一点！”
    群众的反映和陈侠同志的意见，使支部书记郑元阜同志的头脑开始清醒起来，他说：“两天来，对我的教育很大。昨天看看没有问题，昨夜想想好像有问题，今天一听知道问题很多。当天晚上，郑元阜同志带着笔记本到平塔生产队召开社员座谈会，征求群众的意见去了。
    从这件事情可以看出，基层组织，是多么迫切地需要领导干部的具体帮助。各级领导干部，应当经常地深入基层组织，加强对基层组织的具体领导。
