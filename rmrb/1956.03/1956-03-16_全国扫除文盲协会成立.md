　　Xinhua News Agency, March 15th. The National Association for Eliminating Illiteracy of the People's Republic of China was established today.

　　The inaugural meeting was held in the auditorium of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing.

　　The establishment of the National Association for Eliminating Illiteracy is to assist the government in more broadly mobilizing and organizing social forces to carry out the movement to eliminate illiteracy, complete the task of eliminating illiteracy on schedule according to the national plan, and to meet the needs of socialist construction. Chen Yi, Vice Premier of the State Council, gave important instructions at the meeting. Chen Yi pointed out that the establishment of the National Association for Eliminating Illiteracy and the elimination of illiteracy among 78% of the population nationwide is an unprecedented and great undertaking. To build our country into a socialist industrial country, that is, to build it into a country with a high level of culture, the central link is to carry out a cultural revolution. Literacy work is the first step in the cultural revolution. He also pointed out that the spiritual wealth hidden in hundreds of millions of people can be transformed into unlimited material strength through literacy, reading, and understanding. He asked that illiterate people be organized, various literacy methods be adopted, and that they persist in learning throughout the year to advance towards culture. Illiterate people should consciously participate in cultural learning. Chen Yi finally hoped that intellectuals and literate people across the country would actively participate in literacy work and become good soldiers in the literacy army. He said that intellectuals and literate people themselves bring with them the task of teaching people to read, and therefore, they should consciously and actively teach people to read. This is a manifestation of love for the working people and love for socialism.

　　Zhang Xiruo, Minister of Education, reported at the meeting on the current situation of eliminating illiteracy, the experience of various localities in piloting associations for eliminating illiteracy over the past year, and the preparations for the National Association for Eliminating Illiteracy.

　　Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Zhang Yun, Vice Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and Luo Yi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, also spoke at the meeting. They represented the trade union, women's federation, and youth league systems, expressing their commitment to actively carry out literacy work and mobilize illiterate workers, young and middle-aged farmers, and women to enthusiastically participate in literacy learning. Yuan Lu, a carpenter from the Beijing Fourth Construction Engineering Company who had just escaped illiteracy, and Zhang Yulu, president of the Landianchang Township Association for Eliminating Illiteracy in Haidian District, Beijing, also spoke at the meeting.

    全国扫除文盲协会成立
    新华社15日讯　中华人民共和国全国扫除文盲协会今天成立。
    成立大会在北京中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会礼堂举行。
    全国扫除文盲协会的成立，是为了协助政府更广泛地动员和组织社会力量，开展扫除文盲的运动，按照国家计划如期完成扫除文盲的任务，以适应社会主义建设的需要。国务院副总理陈毅在会上作了重要指示。陈毅指出，成立全国扫除文盲协会，在全国范围扫除占人口78％的文盲，是一项空前的伟大事业。要把我国建设成为社会主义工业国家，即建设成为具有高度的文化水平的国家，其中心环节就是要实行一次文化革命。扫盲工作是文化革命的第一步。他又指出，在几万万人民中蕴藏着的精神财富，通过识字读书明理等途径发挥出来，就可以成为无限大的物质力量。他要求把不识字的人组织起来，采用各种扫盲的方法，常年坚持学习，向文化进军。不识字的人要自觉地参加文化学习。陈毅最后希望全国的知识分子和识字的人都积极参加扫盲工作，成为扫盲大军中的好战士。他说，知识分子和识字的人本身就带来一个教人识字的任务，因此，就应该自觉地积极地去教人识字。这是热爱劳动人民、热爱社会主义的一种表现。
    教育部部长张奚若在会上报告了当前扫除文盲的情况、一年来各地试办扫除文盲协会的经验和全国扫除文盲协会的筹备经过。
    中华全国总工会主席赖若愚、中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席章蕴、中国新民主主义青年团中央书记处书记罗毅都在会上讲了话。他们代表工会、妇联和青年团系统，表示要积极开展扫盲工作，动员职工、青壮年农民和妇女中的文盲踊跃参加扫盲学习。在会上讲话的还有刚刚摆脱了文盲状态的北京市第四建筑工程公司的木工袁录和北京市海淀区蓝靛厂乡扫除文盲协会会长张玉禄等人。
    出席这次大会的有中央有关单位的代表、北京市各有关机关干部、厂矿职工和郊区农民的代表，扫盲干部和教师，共1，500多人。大会一致通过了全国扫除文盲协会的章程，并且选出了会长、副会长、委员和秘书长。
