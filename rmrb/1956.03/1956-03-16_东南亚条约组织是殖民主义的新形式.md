    The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is a New Form of Colonialism
    Cui Qi
    From the day of its establishment, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization has been attacked and opposed by the people of Asian countries. The broad masses of people in Asian countries recognize that this treaty organization is an aggressive bloc directed against the People's of China and other peace-loving Asian countries, and is a new form of colonialism established and maintained by the United States in Asia. The actual activities of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization over the past year and a half, as well as the results of the recent Karachi conference, have further proven this point.
    The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization was created in the following circumstances: due to the powerful development of national independence movements in Asia, the colonial system is collapsing, and imperialism has had to abandon some of its long-used colonial methods in this region and adopt some new tactics. They are trying to use the method of organizing military blocs to create opposition among Asian countries, so that some Asian countries oppose other Asian countries, in order to facilitate them in maintaining imperialist colonial positions in Asia, and to combat the national independence movements of Asian countries, turning countries that have embarked on the road of independent development back into their colonies.
    In order to conceal this colonial ambition, the United States, like the former German and Japanese fascists, wants to use the fictitious "Communist threat" to divert the attention of the Asian people and prevent them from seeing the real threat of colonialism. At the same time, the United States also appears as a "friend" of the Asian people, falsely claiming that it has a "responsibility" to "protect" Asian countries. As everyone knows, this forced "protection" regardless of the will of the Asian countries themselves is a fundamental denial of the independence and sovereignty of Asian countries, and treats Asian countries as appendages of colonial powers. This is precisely a typical manifestation of colonialism.
    In order to conceal this colonial ambition, the planners of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization have also brought out the United Nations Charter to defend themselves, portraying it as if it were a regional convention. However, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is not regional even in form. This treaty was planned by the United States and Western countries behind the backs of most Asian countries. The population of Pakistan, the Philippines, and Thailand, the Asian countries that were dragged into this treaty, only accounts for one-tenth of the total population of Asia. They are in a subordinate position in this treaty organization, while the United States, which is tens of thousands of miles away from Southeast Asia, is in a dominant position in the treaty organization. Therefore, as Indian representative to the United Nations Menon said: "No matter what imaginative extensions or interpretations are made to the United Nations Charter, this Southeast Asia Treaty Organization cannot comply with the provisions of the United Nations Charter."
    In fact, the Southeast Asia Treaty is completely an unscrupulous tool for interfering in Asian affairs. According to the provisions of the treaty and the interpretation of US Secretary of State Dulles, as long as the United States and the contracting parties are dealing with the fabricated "armed attacks" and "aggression," or to deal with "indirect aggression" and "subversive activities," or to deal with "threats in any way other than armed attack," or even to deal with "any (!) facts or situations that the United States believes endanger the peace of the region," they can "immediately consult" "actions that should be taken." At the same time, the area "protected" by this treaty not only includes the territory of the contracting parties, not only flagrantly violates the Geneva Accords, including the territories of Cambodia, Laos, and South Vietnam, and not only includes the "general area" of Southeast Asia and the Southwest Pacific, but also can include "any (!) country or territory that the contracting parties may designate by unanimous agreement in the future." In a word, the United States uses the Southeast Asia Treaty to create any excuse at any time, in any region of Asia, to carry out any form of interference to suppress national independence movements and expand its colonial power. No wonder even American bourgeois political commentator Lippmann believes that the imperialist nature of this treaty is too blatant. He said that this treaty is a "formal document aimed at allowing international interference in internal affairs."
    Obviously, the first to suffer are the Asian countries that participate in this treaty organization. We can see how many privileges the United States has maintained and obtained in the three Asian contracting countries by using the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and how much damage it has caused to the independence and sovereignty of these countries.
    First, the United States infringes on these countries' territorial rights, airspace rights, and sea rights. The United States can build military bases, naval ports, and strategic highways in these countries. The US military can hold large-scale exercises in these countries' territories, airspace, and seas. The United States also stations troops in certain countries.
    Second, the United States controls the military power of these countries. US military delegations formulate military expansion plans and train the armies of these countries according to the instructions of the Pentagon. At the Karachi conference, Dulles also "suggested" the establishment of a "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Force," wanting to unify the armies of these countries under the command of American generals.
    Third, the United States has obtained the privilege of interfering in the political life and social movements of these countries. The permanent institutions of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization include a so-called "Anti-Subversion" committee, and the Karachi conference decided to establish an intelligence "research center" so that the contracting parties can implement "mutual assistance" in "anti-subversion." Dulles revealed that the United States would send "representatives with the highest decision-making power" from the Federal Bureau of Investigation to participate in this institution.
    Fourth, the United States manipulates the financial autonomy of these countries. The United States uses military "aid" not only to have the right to decide on the use of the aid itself, but also often further dominates the finances of the recipient countries, forcing them to act according to the intentions of the United States.
    Fifth, the United States undermines the trade autonomy of these countries and uses various methods to restrict normal trade exchanges between the contracting parties and other countries in Asia.
    Sixth, the United States has a large military delegation stationed in these countries, who can run rampant on other people's land and actually enjoy extraterritorial rights.
    It can be seen that the privileges actually obtained by the United States in certain Asian countries by organizing military blocs, in many respects, far exceed the unequal relations between many suzerain states and colonies in history.
    Since the United States is in a dominant position in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, it is only the United States that can decide the policies of this group, not the Asian countries that are dragged into the treaty. The three Asian contracting parties do not get any benefits, but only have the obligation to provide cannon fodder and suffer economic plunder. In the eyes of American colonialists, this unequal relationship seems to be a matter of course, because there are two groups in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization: Western news agencies openly call them "rich countries" and "poor countries." As everyone knows, the United States uses this unequal relationship to maintain and strengthen its colonial power, and strives to put some Asian countries under its enslavement and exploitation.
    As early as on the eve of the establishment of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, Associated Press reporter Goldberg wrote: "If the defense that Dulles wants to establish is really established, what Dulles will get is as follows... The Philippines is rich in wood, minerals and fruits. ... Thailand is rich in rice, kapok wood, rubber and cotton. Its mines produce coal, tin, iron, manganese, tungsten, antimony and mercury. ... The Indochina Peninsula has two rice-producing areas, producing iron, tungsten, manganese, zinc, tin, rice, rubber and wood."
    Under the plunder of the United States, the economic situation of the three Asian countries that have been dragged into the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in recent years has deteriorated significantly and without exception. On the eve of the Karachi conference, Pakistani Foreign Minister Chaudhry pointed out: "The biggest danger facing our country and other backward countries that participate in the Baghdad Pact and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization alliance" is "increasing economic difficulties and poverty."
    Currently, Pakistan's military expenditure accounts for 67% of the total budget, an increase of 30% over the previous year. Thailand's military expenditure accounts for 70% of the total budget, an increase of 10% over 1954. The Philippines' military expenditure has also increased this year. Heavy military expenditure directly deepens the financial crisis and affects the economic development of these countries. According to official Philippine figures, by the middle of this year, the Philippine fiscal deficit will reach 262 million pesos, and the government's various debts will reach 2 billion pesos. The Thai government's current debt has reached 6 billion baht. In this case, taxes increase, prices rise, and the lives of the broad masses of people are greatly harmed.
    Due to the intensification of military expansion, the continuous import of large amounts of military supplies, and the large-scale plunder by colonial countries through unequal trade, the trade crisis in Pakistan, the Philippines, and Thailand is also becoming increasingly serious. In June 1955, Pakistan's gold and foreign exchange reserves were reduced by about half compared to 1951. The Philippines' foreign exchange reserves have fallen to the lowest level since 1949. From January to September 1955, Thailand's trade deficit increased by about 70% compared to the trade deficit for the entire year of 1954. In order to save this serious situation, Pakistan was forced to devalue the rupee by 30% last year, and the Thai baht was also devalued by 12%.
    These facts show that the so-called "protection" of the United States is the privilege of colonial countries to plunder Asian resources and cruelly exploit the people of Asian countries. The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is not only a military bloc of colonial countries, but also a new form for them to exploit economically backward countries.
    It is precisely because of this that the contradictions between colonial countries in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization over colonial interests are becoming increasingly apparent. The United States is trying its best to expand the scope of activities of this military group it controls, making it a tool that is more conducive to the United States for economic expansion. To this end, the United States has repeatedly wanted to take over the "Colombo Plan" manipulated by Britain in the name of the Southeast Asia Treaty. This has aroused opposition from Britain, because it will harm British colonial interests in Asia and will cause Britain to be squeezed out more fiercely by the United States in the Asian market. This kind of wrestling between the United States and Britain more clearly exposes the colonialist nature of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.
    Today, the Asian situation is advancing rapidly along the road of peace and independence. The military blocs pieced together by colonial countries are becoming increasingly unpopular, and their foundations are becoming increasingly fragile and shaken. Not only have the United States' conspiracies to force other Asian countries to participate in this kind of group activity been repeatedly defeated, but also in the three Asian countries that have been dragged into this group, the broad public and insightful politicians have criticized this treaty. Millions of people in Asian countries have awakened. Their common wish is to develop their own economy and culture and improve the living standards of the people. They understand that in order to achieve this goal, they must first achieve national independence and defend peace. No matter what new methods the colonialists adopt, there is no way to stop the great trend of revival in the East.

    东南亚条约组织是殖民主义的新形式
    崔奇
    东南亚条约组织从它成立的一天起，就遭到亚洲各国人民的抨击和反对。亚洲各国广大人民认清，这个条约组织是指向中华人民共和国和其他亚洲爱好和平国家的侵略集团，是美国在亚洲建立和维护殖民制度的新形式。一年半以来东南亚条约组织的实际活动，以及最近举行的喀喇蚩会议的结果，都进一步地证明了这一点。
    东南亚条约组织是在这样情况下产生的：由于亚洲民族独立运动的强大发展，殖民制度正在土崩瓦解，帝国主义不得不在这个地区放弃他们素来惯用的一些殖民方式，而采取某些新的手腕。他们力图利用组织军事集团的办法，在亚洲国家之间制造对立，让一部分亚洲国家反对另一部分亚洲国家，以便于他们在亚洲维持帝国主义的殖民阵地，并打击亚洲国家的民族独立运动，把已经走上了独立发展道路的国家重新沦为它们的殖民地。
    为了掩饰这种殖民主义的野心，美国像过去德日法西斯一样，想用虚构的“共产党威胁”来转移亚洲人民的注意力，让他们看不到殖民主义的真正威胁。同时，美国还以亚洲人民的“朋友”的面目出现，妄称它有“责任”“保护”亚洲国家。大家知道，这种不顾亚洲国家自己意志的强行“保护”，根本就是否认亚洲国家的独立和主权，把亚洲国家看作殖民大国的附属地。这恰恰是一种典型的殖民主义的表现。
    为了掩饰这种殖民主义的野心，东南亚条约组织的策划者又搬出联合国宪章来替自己辩护，把它说成似乎是一个区域性公约。但是，东南亚条约组织即使单单从形式上看也不是区域性的。这个条约是美国和西方国家背着大多数亚洲国家策划的，被拉进这个条约的亚洲国家巴基斯坦、菲律宾、泰国的人口仅占亚洲全部人口的
  十分之一，它们在这个条约组织中处于从属地位，而远隔东南亚万里之遥的美国却在条约组织中处于支配的地位。因此，正如印度驻联合国代表梅农所说：“不论对联合国宪章加以怎样想入非非的引申或解释，这个东南亚公约组织都不能合乎联合国宪章的规定。”
    事实上，东南亚条约完全是一个无法无天的干涉亚洲事务的工具。按照条约的规定和美国国务卿杜勒斯的解释，美国和缔约国只要为了对付它们所捏造的“武装进攻”和“侵略”，或者为了对付“间接侵略”和“颠复活动”，或者为了对付“武装进攻以外的任何方式的威胁”，甚至只要为了对付美国认为的“危及本区域的和平的任何（！）事实或情势”，它们就可以“立即磋商”“应当采取的行动”。同时，受这个条约“保护”的地区，不仅包括缔约国的领土，不仅悍然违背日内瓦协议，包括柬埔寨、老挝和越南南部的领土，也不仅包括东南亚和西南太平洋的“一般地区”，而且可以包括“各缔约国今后可能经一致协议指定的任何（！）国家或领土”。一句话，美国利用东南亚条约，可以在任何时候，制造任何借口，在亚洲的任何地区，进行任何方式的干涉，来镇压民族独立运动，并扩张它的殖民势力。无怪乎连美国资产阶级政论家李普曼也认为这个条约的帝国主义性质太露骨了。他说，这个条约是一个“旨在允许对内政实行国际干涉的正式文件”。
    显然，首先受害的是参加这个条约组织的亚洲国家。我们可以看看，美国利用东南亚条约组织，在三个亚洲缔约国中维持了和取得了多少特权，给这些国家的独立和主权带来多么大的损害。
    第一，美国侵犯了这些国家的领土权、领空权和领海权。美国可以在这些国家修建军事基地、军港和战略公路。美国军事力量可以在这些国家领土、领空和领海上举行大演习。美国还在某些国家中驻扎军队。
    第二，美国控制了这些国家的军权。美国军事代表团按照五角大楼的指示来制定扩军计划，并训练这些国家的军队。在喀喇蚩会议上，杜勒斯还曾“建议”建立一支“东南亚条约组织部队”，想把这些国家的军队统一于美国将军的指挥之下。
    第三，美国取得了干涉这些国家的政治生活和社会运动的特权。东南亚条约组织的常设机构包括一个所谓“反颠复”委员会，喀喇蚩会议并决定建立一个情报“研究中心”，以便缔约国在“反颠复”方面实行“互助”。杜勒斯透露过，美国要派遣联邦调查局的“有最高决定权的代表”参加了这个机构。
    第四，美国操纵了这些国家的财政自主权。美国利用军事“援助”，不仅有权决定援款本身的使用，并且往往进而支配了受援国的财政，逼迫它们按照美国的意图行事。
    第五，美国破坏了这些国家的贸易自主权，用各种办法限制缔约国同亚洲其他一些国家之间的正常贸易往来。
    第六，美国在这些国家驻有庞大的军事代表团，他们可以在别人的土地上横行，实际上享有治外法权。
    由此可见，美国利用组织军事集团的办法在某些亚洲国家实际上所取得的特权，从许多方面讲，远远超过了历史上许多宗主国和殖民地之间的不平等关系。
    由于美国在东南亚条约组织中处于支配的地位，决定这个集团的政策的只能是美国，而不是被拖进条约的亚洲国家。亚洲的三个缔约国得不到任何好处，而只有提供炮灰和遭受经济掠夺的义务。在美国殖民者看来，这种不平等的关系似乎是天经地义的，因为在东南亚条约组织中有着两个集团：西方通讯社公然把它们称为“富裕国”和“贫困国”。大家知道，美国就是利用这种不平等的关系来维持和加强它的殖民势力，竭力把一些亚洲国家放在它的奴役和剥削之下。
    美联社记者戈德堡早在东南亚条约组织成立前夕就写过：“如果杜勒斯想要建立的防御真的建立起来的话，杜勒斯将得到的东西如下……菲律宾盛产木材、矿产和水果。……泰国盛产大米、麻粟树木材、橡胶和棉花。它的矿山生产煤、锡、铁、锰、钨、锑和水银。……印度支那半岛有两个盛产大米的地区，生产铁、钨、锰、锌、锡、大米、橡胶和木材。”
    在美国的掠夺下，近年来被拖进东南亚条约组织的三个亚洲国家的经济情况，显著地无例外地恶化了。喀喇蚩会议前夕，巴基斯坦外交部长乔德里指出：“摆在我们国家以及一起参加巴格达条约和东南亚条约组织联盟的其他落后国家面前的最大的危险”，就是“日益增加的经济困难和贫困。”
    目前，巴基斯坦的军费占全部预算的67％，比前一年度增加了30％。泰国的军费占全部预算的70％，比1954年增加10％。菲律宾今年度的军费也增加了。沉重的军费开支，直接加深了财政危机，并影响到这些国家的经济发展。据菲律宾官方承认，到今年年中，菲律宾财政赤字将达26，200万比索，政府的各种债务达20亿比索。泰国政府目前的债务已达60亿铢。在这种情况下，赋税增加，物价上涨，广大人民生活受到极大损害。
    由于加紧扩军，不断输入大量军火，由于殖民国家通过不平等贸易进行大规模掠夺，巴基斯坦、菲律宾和泰国的贸易危机也日益严重。1955年6月，巴基斯坦的黄金、外汇储备比1951年减少约一半。菲律宾的外汇储备已降到1949年以来最低的水平。1955年1月到9月，泰国的贸易逆差较1954年全年的贸易逆差增加了70％左右。为了挽救这种严重情况，去年巴基斯坦被迫把卢比贬值30％，泰币也贬值12％。
    这些事实说明了，美国的所谓“保护”，就是殖民国家掠夺亚洲的资源、残酷地剥削亚洲各国人民的特权。东南亚条约组织不仅是殖民国家的军事集团，而且是它们借以剥削经济落后国家的新形式。
    正是因为这样，在东南亚条约组织内部，殖民国家之间争夺殖民利益的矛盾正日益表面化。美国竭力要把它所控制的这个军事集团的活动范围扩大，使它成为更便于美国进行经济扩张的工具。为此，美国几次想把英国所操纵的“科伦坡计划”用东南亚条约的名义接收过来。这引起了英国的反对，因为它将损害英国在亚洲的殖民利益，并将使英国在亚洲市场上遭到美国更猛烈的排挤。美英的这种角斗更清楚地暴露了东南亚条约组织的殖民主义的本质。
    今天，亚洲形势正在沿着和平和独立的道路迅速前进。殖民国家所拼凑的军事集团越来越不得人心，它的基础越来越脆弱和动摇了。不仅美国压迫其他亚洲国家参加这种集团的阴谋活动不断遭到失败，而且在被拖进这个集团的3个亚洲国家中，广大公众和有见识的政治人士也抨击这个条约。千百万的亚洲各国人民已经觉醒了。他们的共同愿望是发展自己的经济与文化，提高人民生活水平。他们懂得，要达到这个目的，首先就要取得民族独立，并保卫和平。不论殖民主义者采取什么新的方式，也没有办法阻挡东方各国的伟大的复兴潮流。
