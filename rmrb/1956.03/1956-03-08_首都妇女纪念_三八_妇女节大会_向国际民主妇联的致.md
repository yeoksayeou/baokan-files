    Over the past year, our country's socialist revolution has achieved great victories. Now, Beijing women, together with the people of the entire city and the entire country, are working hard to complete and overfulfill the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, to strive for the peaceful liberation of our homeland's territory of Taiwan, and to defend the great cause of world peace! The women of Beijing wholeheartedly and enthusiastically support the "Appeal to the Women of the World" issued by the Women's International Democratic Federation, and actively support the convening of the World Conference of Women Workers. We are determined to unite even more closely with women sisters around the world and all peace-loving people, to fight to the end for the glorious cause of peace, and for striving for and defending the rights of women and children!
