Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd: Zheng Wenhua, a Chinese student who studied international law at New York University in the United States, told reporters today that he lost his job immediately after notifying the U.S. Immigration Service in October last year that he wanted to return to China.

Zheng Wenhua said, "I originally planned to resign in November when I was about to return home. However, on October 10th last year, after I notified the U.S. Immigration Service of my decision to return home, the company boss called me in. He said he had no choice but to dismiss me immediately. Of course, he didn't tell me the reason, but I knew very well: someone had put pressure on him." Zheng Wenhua said this was just one of the many methods used by the U.S. authorities to threaten Chinese students who wanted to return home.

His wife, Tang Siwei, said that on October 18th last year, the fourth day after her husband was fired, an agent from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation came to their home at 552 Riverside Drive, New York, to investigate. She said, "The tall American flashed an FBI badge and immediately fired off a barrage of questions, such as, where did your husband go? Do you really know he's no longer working? Are you going back to Mao Zedong's or Chiang Kai-shek's China? Don't you want to go to Taiwan?"

"I was very scared at the time, and I thought it would be best not to answer. This agent was obviously there to investigate whether my husband's boss had fired him. FBI agents always came to question me about him when my husband wasn't home. They often questioned him about me, and me about him, to cross-check for loopholes. They had come to my house many times in the past to ask us if we were communists and if we had any connections with China? The last time was more than a month after the agreement in Geneva on the repatriation of civilians was signed."

The young couple also said that they encountered harassment from American and Chiang Kai-shek agents many times on their way back to China. Zheng Wenhua said, "A few hours before we boarded the ship in San Francisco, a local Kuomintang consulate official came to the hotel to find us. In Yokohama, three Chiang Kai-shek agents boarded the ship to meet with us. When the ship arrived in Manila, two Kuomintang agents and a Filipino maritime police officer came to find us one after another. My wife was taking care of our two children in the cabin, and the Filipino maritime police officer secretly monitored her. The Kuomintang agents told her that she could go to the Kuomintang embassy in Manila, and they would help her go to Taiwan."

Zheng Wenhua and his wife recently arrived in Beijing. They are now temporarily staying at the Higher Education Department's international student guest house.

### 美国当局用解雇办法威胁想要回国的中国留学生

    美国当局用解雇办法威胁想要回国的中国留学生
    新华社3日讯　曾经在美国纽约大学学国际法的我国留学生郑文华今天对记者谈称，他在去年10月间通知美国移民局说他要回国之后，立即失去了工作。
    郑文华说，“我本来打算在11月间启程回国的时候再辞掉职务的。可是就在去年10月10日我把准备回国的决定通知美国移民局之后，公司的老板就把我叫去，他说他除了马上把我辞退以外没有别的办法。自然罗，他没有告诉我是什么原因，可是我知道得很清楚：谁在他身上加了压力。”郑文华说这不过是美国当局用来威胁想要回国的中国留学生的许多手段中的一种而已。
    他的妻子唐斯威说，去年10月18日，她丈夫被解雇后的第四天，美国联邦调查局的一个特务人员就到纽约河边大道552号她们家里去盘查。她说：“那个高大个子的美国人亮了一亮联邦调查局的铜牌，紧接着就发出了一大串问题，诸如，你的丈夫到那儿去了？你确实知道他已经不在工作了吗？你们是要回到毛泽东还是蒋介石的中国去？你不想到台湾去吗？
    “我当时很害怕，就想最好还是不回答为妙。这个特务显然是来调查我丈夫的老板到底有没有把他辞退掉。联邦调查局特务人员总是在我丈夫不在家的时候来盘问关于他的事情。他们常向他查问我，向我查问他，以互相对照看有没有空子可钻。过去他们曾经多次到我家来盘问我，我们是不是共产党，跟国内有什么联系没有？而最后一次却是在日内瓦关于双方平民回国的协议签订后一个多月以后的事。”
    这一对年轻的夫妇还说她们在回国途中一路上遇到不少次美蒋特务的骚扰。郑文华说：“我们在旧金山上船前几小时的时候，有一个当地国民党领事馆的人员到旅馆里来找我们。在横滨的时候，又有三个蒋介石特务上船来打算和我们会见。船到马尼拉的时候，两个国民党特务和一个菲律宾水警先后来找我们。我的妻子正在船舱里照管我们的两个孩子，那个菲律宾水警暗中监视她。国民党特务告诉她说她可以到马尼拉的国民党大使馆去，他们会帮助她到台湾去。”
    郑文华和他的妻子是最近到达北京的。他们现在暂时住在高等教育部留学生招待所里。
