Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 22nd: The Phnom Penh "Mekong Daily" of March 16th reported that more than 500 South Vietnamese soldiers invaded a place in Takeo Province of the Kingdom of Cambodia on March 10th, but retreated after being counterattacked by the army of the Kingdom of Cambodia.

There were also messages in Phnom Penh newspapers that eight Thai aircraft had intruded into Cambodian airspace on February 27th.

The Cambodian "Samapheap Serei" newspaper published an editorial on these events, saying that all South Vietnamese and Thai violations of the Cambodian border and the military blockade measures they have taken were instigated by imperialism. The newspaper said that because the Kingdom of Cambodia adheres to a policy of peace and neutrality, imperialism is plotting to threaten Cambodia by such means, especially trying to put Cambodia in difficulty through a military blockade and force Cambodia to bow to them. The "Samapheap Serei" newspaper said that the Cambodian nation is a brave nation and will never succumb to threats. The Cambodian people and the people of the world have seen through and will resolutely oppose the despicable conspiracies of the number one imperialist aggressors.

The Cambodian "Voice of the Military" radio station also criticized the South Vietnamese army for violating the Cambodian border on March 14th, denouncing the actions of the South Vietnamese army as deliberate actions directed by their superiors.

    柬埔寨舆论
    抗议南越军队和泰国飞机入侵
    据新华社河内22日电　这里收到的三月十六日的金边“湄江日报”报道，南越军队五百多名在三月十日曾经侵入柬埔寨王国茶胶省一个地方，但是在柬埔寨王国军队反击后撤退了。
    金边报纸上还有消息说，泰国飞机八架曾在二月二十七日侵入柬埔寨的领空。
    柬埔寨“山庙报”就这些事件发表社论说，所有南越和泰国对柬埔寨边境的侵犯事件及它们所采取的军事封锁措施都是帝国主义指使的。这家报纸说，因为柬埔寨王国坚持和平中立政策，帝国主义阴谋用这种手段来威胁柬埔寨，特别是想通过军事封锁使柬埔寨陷于困难，压迫柬埔寨向它们屈膝。“山庙报”说，柬埔寨民族是勇敢的民族，决不会屈服于威胁，柬埔寨人民和世界人民都已经看清了并且将坚决反对头号帝国主义侵略者的卑鄙阴谋。
    柬埔寨“军人之声”电台也在三月十四日抨击南越军队侵犯柬埔寨边境，它斥责南越军队的行动是受它们的上级指使的有意的行动。
