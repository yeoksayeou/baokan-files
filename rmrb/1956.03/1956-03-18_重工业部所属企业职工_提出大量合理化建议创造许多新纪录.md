Xinhua News Agency, March 17th: Employees of production and capital construction units under the Ministry of Heavy Industry have proposed tens of thousands of rationalization suggestions in the recent two months of the socialist emulation drive, with the number of rationalization suggestions greatly exceeding past records. According to statistics from the Non-ferrous Metals Industry Administration alone, employees of some enterprises under this administration proposed nearly 9,000 rationalization suggestions in January and February of this year, which is almost equal to the total number of rationalization suggestions from all enterprises under this administration in the entire year of 1955.

Many rationalization suggestions proposed by employees of enterprises under the Ministry of Heavy Industry this year are of great significance for improving production levels. Suggestions made by workers and technicians of the Medium-sized Rolling Mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, such as adding side burners to the heating furnace, improving the rolling mill lifting platform, and improving the rollers and operating methods of the straightening machine, can increase the plant's rolling capacity by about 30% compared to 1955 after implementation, which will ensure that the plant completes the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

Xinhua News Agency, March 17th: The person in charge of the National Committee of the Chinese Heavy Industry Trade Union told our reporter today that according to statistics from various iron and steel enterprises and some non-ferrous metal enterprises, chemical enterprises, and building materials enterprises, more than 400 new production records in various aspects have emerged in the past two months.

The person in charge said that the continuous emergence of new production records has become a common phenomenon in enterprises under the Ministry of Heavy Industry. From January to March 15 this year, the Iron Smelting Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company continuously created 9 new records for the plant's highest daily output. The latest new record for daily output exceeded the highest record last year by 7.7%. Since the beginning of this year, the joint state-private owned Huaxin Cement Plant has created more than 40 new records.

The person in charge said that the scope of new records appearing in various enterprises this year is relatively broad. According to statistics from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, among the 88 new records that appeared in January and February this year, 34 were for increasing output, 16 were for improving product quality, and 6 were for reducing costs. Although the production plan for this plant in January and February was greatly improved compared to the past, the production plans for both months were overfulfilled, and product quality was also gradually improved.

    重工业部所属企业职工
    提出大量合理化建议创造许多新纪录
    据新华社17日讯　重工业部所属生产和基本建设单位的职工在最近两个月的社会主义竞赛中，提出了成千累万的合理化建议，合理化建议的数量大大超过了过去的纪录。仅据有色金属工业管理局统计，这个局所属的部分企业的职工在今年1、2月份就提出了近9，000件合理化建议，差不多等于这个局所属全部企业1955年全年的合理化建议数字。
    重工业部所属企业职工今年提出的许多合理化建议对提高生产水平有重大意义。鞍山钢铁公司中型轧钢厂工人和技术人员提出的在加热炉上增加侧烧咀子、改进轧钢机升降台、改进矫直机的轧辊和操作方法等建议，实现以后可以使全厂轧钢能力比1955年提高30％左右，将保证这个厂提前完成五年计划。
    据新华社17日讯　中国重工业工会全国委员会负责人今天对本社记者说：根据各钢铁企业和部分有色金属企业、化学企业、建筑材料企业的统计，今年两个多月里，共出现了400多次各个方面的生产新纪录。
    负责人说，不断出现新的生产纪录，已经是重工业部所属企业普遍的现象。鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂从今年1月到3月15日连续创造了9次全厂日产量最高纪录，最近的一次日产量新纪录比去年最高的纪录多出铁7.7％。公私合营华新水泥厂今年以来共出现了40多次新纪录。
    负责人说，今年各企业出现的新纪录的范围是比较广泛的。据石景山钢铁厂统计，在今年1、2月份出现的88次新纪录中，提高产量的有34次，提高产品质量的有16次，降低成本的有6次。这个厂1、2月份生产计划虽然比过去有很大提高，但是两个月的生产计划都超额完成了，产品质量也逐步提高。
