    Introducing a County Newspaper – The Wuxing Daily
    Liu Kai
    The Wuxing Daily is the official newspaper of the Wuxing County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Zhejiang. It is a small, five-day octavo newspaper that has published over forty issues since its inception last July. This newspaper has some merits in both content and form, which are worth introducing here.
    Reading the Wuxing Daily since its inception, one can see that this newspaper closely integrates with the county's agricultural cooperativization movement and agricultural production increase movement, using specific examples to conduct propaganda and education among the peasant masses, and promote and guide the movement forward. When the Wuxing Daily was first launched, it faced the urgent tasks of pest control and drought resistance. In order to mobilize cadres and the masses to eradicate pests and overcome drought, the newspaper, on the one hand, promptly criticized passive thoughts and complacency, arming people ideologically; on the other hand, it paid attention to commending advanced figures who actively fought against natural disasters, disseminated technical knowledge of pest control and experience in organization and leadership, and encouraged people's confidence in overcoming natural disasters. When the agricultural cooperativization movement was reaching a climax, in addition to enthusiastically reflecting the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants demanding to join the cooperatives, the newspaper also grasped an important issue in the movement—the implementation of the class line—and launched a discussion on "Is it right to prevent poor peasants from joining cooperatives?", using vivid examples to conduct a specific education on the Party's class policy for rural cadres and peasant masses. In order to promote the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives and winter production, in November of last year, the newspaper supported the entire cadre of Huanzhu Township and the Huanzhu Township First Agricultural Cooperative in launching a production competition to the entire county, and opened a special column of "Consolidating New Cooperatives, Improving Old Cooperatives, and Vigorously Launching Winter Production Competition" for reporting. Recently, the newspaper has focused on the issue of increasing agricultural production, vigorously introducing the county's large-scale high-yield experience, criticizing right-leaning conservative ideas in agricultural production, and struggling to achieve high-yield production of 1,000 jin of grain, 100 jin of cocoons, 1,000 jin of fish, and 10,000 jin of sweet potatoes in Wuxing County. It can be seen from this that the Wuxing Daily's propaganda and reports are closely integrated with the agricultural cooperativization movement and agricultural production increase movement. Mobilizing and organizing the masses to realize agricultural cooperativization and increase agricultural production is the most central task of the county newspaper; the Wuxing Daily is right to do so.
    Although the Wuxing Daily uses the main space to reflect the agricultural cooperativization movement and agricultural production, and reports on the county's central work in various periods, it has not, like some county newspapers, turned itself into a simple "production newspaper" or "central work bulletin." The reporting scope is relatively broad, and the content of the reports is relatively rich; this is another feature of the Wuxing Daily. It not only reflects the affairs of rural areas and peasants, but also appropriately reflects the activities of workers, handicraftsmen, and small vendors in the county. In this newspaper, we have read稿件 such as "Workers are Enthusiastic, Completing the National Plan Ten Days Ahead of Schedule," "The Friendship Between Workers and Peasants is as Deep as the Sea," and "A Role Model for Small Vendors," which reflect the production of workers, the connection between workers and peasants, and the cooperativization of small vendors in the county. It not only reports on the county's central work, but also pays attention to reporting the changes in the material and cultural life of peasants, and disseminates natural science knowledge and agricultural technology knowledge to peasants. The newspaper's columns such as "Good Cooperative Members," "Mass Cultural Life," "Popular Science," and "Agricultural Technology Exchange Station" are set up to meet the needs of the above propaganda content. It not only reports on the county's affairs, but also takes the task of conducting current affairs propaganda to the peasant masses as its own task. For example, the February 10th issue of the newspaper, in the special column of "Recent Major Domestic and International Events," published four news items about the military struggle in coastal areas such as Fujian and the cooperativization movement in Jiangsu and other provinces; the February 18th issue of the newspaper published a popular current affairs speech entitled "Cheering the Sixth Anniversary of the Powerful Sino-Soviet Friendship Alliance." In this way, the newspaper can better meet the diverse needs of the broad masses of readers.
    The forms are lively and diverse, and the language is short, concise and popular; this is also a feature of the Wuxing Daily. In terms of form, in addition to common news, newsletters, commentaries, etc., the newspaper also flexibly uses forms that are popular with the masses, such as speeches, Q&A, readers' letters, photos, propaganda posters, folk songs, and clapper talks. Various manuscripts published in the newspaper are mostly done one thing at a time, getting straight to the point, concise and to the point. Taking news as an example, it is generally one or two hundred words. Not only is the news short, but some articles in the special columns are also relatively short. For example, the articles published in the "Popular Science" column, such as "Frogs are Beneficial Insects, Protect Them Well" and "Is Thunder and Lightning Caused by the God of Thunder and Lightning?", use three or four hundred words to briefly explain an event or explain a natural phenomenon. When the news and articles are short, the number of manuscripts contained in one issue of the newspaper will naturally be larger. The January 16th issue of the Wuxing Daily published 22 manuscripts of various types in the space of two pages of octavo. Lively and diverse forms, and short, concise and popular language are very important for county newspapers; because county newspapers have small formats and long publication periods, and readers are mainly peasants and rural cadres with a rudimentary knowledge of writing, only in this way can readers understand, hear, and be interested. However, some county newspapers do not pay enough attention to this point now. When you open the newspaper, there are mostly long manuscripts of a comprehensive nature and commentaries of more than one or two thousand words. Sometimes only two or three articles are published on one page. This approach is obviously divorced from the masses.
    It can be seen from the above introduction that it is entirely possible to make a small newspaper rich and colorful in content and lively and vivid in form. Of course, the Wuxing Daily also has some shortcomings that need to be improved, such as the propaganda of Party life is not systematic enough, and the ideology of some articles is not strong enough. However, some of the merits of the Wuxing Daily in content and form are worthy of reference by county newspapers in various regions.

    介绍一个县报——吴兴报
    刘凯
    吴兴报是中共浙江吴兴县委的机关报。这是一个八开五日刊的小报，从去年七月创刊到现在，已经出刊了四十多期。这个报纸不论在内容上和形式上都有一些优点，值得在这里加以介绍。
    读了创刊以来的吴兴报，首先可以看到这个报纸能够密切结合本县的农业合作化运动和农业增产运动，用具体的事例向农民群众进行宣传教育，推动和指导运动前进。吴兴报刚一创刊，就面临着治虫、抗旱的紧迫任务。报纸为着动员干部群众扑灭虫害和战胜旱灾，一方面及时地批判消极思想和麻痹情绪，把人们从思想上武装起来；另一方面注意表扬积极向自然灾害作斗争的先进人物，传播治虫的技术知识和组织领导的经验，鼓舞人们战胜自然灾害的信心。当农业合作化运动走向高潮的时候，报纸除了热情地反映广大农民要求入社的社会主义积极性以外，还抓住了运动中的一个重要问题——贯彻执行阶级路线问题，开展了“不要贫困农民入社对不对”的讨论，用活生生的事例，向农村干部和农民群众进行了一次具体的党的阶级政策教育。为了推动农业合作社的巩固工作和冬季生产，去年十一月间，报纸又支持了环渚乡全体干部和环渚乡第一农业合作社向全县发起的生产竞赛，并且辟了“巩固新社、提高老社，大力开展冬季生产竞赛”的专栏进行报道。最近一个时期，报纸围绕着农业增产问题，大力介绍本县的大面积丰产经验，批判农业生产上的右倾保守思想，为在吴兴县实现千斤粮、百斤茧、千斤鱼、万斤薯的高额丰产而斗争。从这里可以看出，吴兴报的宣传报道同农业合作化运动和农业增产运动结合得比较紧密。动员和组织群众实现农业合作化和农业增产，是县报最中心的任务；吴兴报这样做是对的。
    吴兴报虽然用主要的篇幅来反映农业合作化运动和农业生产，报道本县各个时期的中心工作，但是它并没有像有的县报那样，把自己办成简单的“生产报”或“中心工作通报”。报道面比较宽阔，报道的内容比较丰富，这是吴兴报的另一个特点。它不光是反映农村和农民的事情，还适当地反映了本县工人、手工业者、小商小贩等阶层的活动。在这个报纸上，我们就曾经读到像“工人大哥劲头大，提前十天完成国家计划”、“工农友谊深似海”、“小商小贩的榜样”这类反映本县工人生产、工农联系、小商小贩合作化情况的稿件。它不光是报道县里的中心工作，而且注意报道农民物质生活和文化生活的变化的情形，向农民宣传自然科学知识和农业技术知识。报纸上的“好社员”、“群众文化生活”、“大众科学”、“农业技术交流站”等栏目，就是为了适应以上宣传内容的需要而设立的。它不光是报道本县的事情，也把向农民群众进行时事宣传当作自己的任务。例如，二月十日的一期报纸，在“最近国内外大事”的专栏中，就刊登了关于福建等地沿海军事斗争和江苏等省合作化运动情况等方面的消息四条；二月十八日的一期报纸，又发表了“欢呼强大的中苏友好同盟六周年”的通俗时事讲话。这样，报纸就能比较好地满足广大读者的多方面的需要。
    形式活泼多样，文字短小通俗，也是吴兴报的一个特点。在形式方面，除了常见的消息、通讯、评论等等以外，报纸还灵活地运用了讲话、问答、读报人来信、照片、宣传画、山歌、快板等为群众所喜爱的形式。报纸上发表的各种稿件，大都做到了一事一稿，开门见山，简明扼要。拿消息来说，一般都是一两百字。不光是消息短，有些专栏里的文章也比较短。如“大众科学”栏里发表的“青蛙是益虫，好好保护它”、“打雷闪电是雷公雷婆在作法吗？”等文章，都是用三、四百个字来简要地说明一件事或解释一种自然现象。消息和文章短了，一期报纸所容纳的稿件自然也就多了。一月十六日的吴兴报，在八开两版的篇幅中，就发表了各种稿件二十二篇。形式活泼多样，文字短小通俗，对于县报来说非常重要；因为县报篇幅小，刊期长，读者主要是粗识文字的农民和农村干部，只有这样才能使读者看得懂、听得懂，并且发生兴趣。可是现在有些县报对这一点却注意得不够，翻开报纸多是些综合性质的长稿和一两千字以上的评论，有时一个版面只登两三篇文章。这种做法显然是脱离群众的。
    从上面介绍的情况可以看出，把一张小报办得内容丰富多采、形式生动活泼，是完全可能的。当然，吴兴报也有一些缺点需要改进，如党的生活的宣传还不够系统，有的文章的思想性还不够强等。但是吴兴报在内容上和形式上的一些优点，却是值得各地县报参考的。
