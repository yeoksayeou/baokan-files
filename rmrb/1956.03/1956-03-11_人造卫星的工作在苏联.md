Last year, the Soviet Academy of Sciences established a permanent joint commission for interstellar communication. Experts in mechanics, astronomy, thermodynamics, and physics from the Soviet Union, as well as personnel from numerous scientific research institutions of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and various Union Republics, participated in this organization. The emergence of this organization signifies that interstellar communication has the possibility of being solved, and it is gradually moving from the stage of fantasy to the stage of reality.

Launching an artificial satellite is the first step in solving the problem of interstellar communication. These artificial satellites are launched to altitudes of four or five hundred, or even more than a thousand kilometers, where there is no air resistance, and rotate at a speed of 7 kilometers per second. At this time, the artificial satellite will break away from the earth's gravity and orbit the earth for a long time without needing fuel. In this way, people are virtually obtaining a laboratory that exists permanently in high altitude. The research of this laboratory on the actual conditions in high altitude is naturally much richer and more accurate than observing from the ground from afar. Future interstellar communication will rely on the research materials from artificial satellites to solve.

Of course, launching an artificial satellite into high altitude is not something that can be accomplished by ordinary airplanes or balloons. General jet airplanes and balloons can only ascend more than 20 kilometers, while artificial satellites must leave the ground four or five hundred kilometers or more. Launching artificial satellites can only be done by using interstellar rockets.

The Soviet Union is successfully solving the problem of launching interstellar rockets. The academic secretary of the permanent joint commission for interstellar communication, Kalbinco, recently told a reporter from a Moscow newspaper that the Soviet Union's radio-controlled interstellar rocket had reached an altitude of almost 500 kilometers. Sensitive instruments installed on it had recorded phenomena such as temperature and pressure in high altitude.

It is worth pointing out that some living creatures have been sent into high altitude along with the rockets and have safely returned to the ground. The conditions of these creatures in high altitude have been observed on the ground. It is said that the first to go to the sky was a monkey. Perhaps in the future, people will also enter high altitude with equipment like this monkey.

Rockets launched into high altitude can obtain a lot of valuable scientific data, but because rockets can only exist in high altitude for a very short time, the records on the rockets can only be phenomena within a very short time. Artificial satellites launched with rockets are a long-term observation station.

After the rocket carries the artificial satellite into high altitude, the artificial satellite must still rotate at a speed of 7 kilometers per second. Soviet scholars have already achieved speeds several times higher than this in the laboratory. The problem now is to actually bring what has been created in the laboratory to high altitude and rotate it at the required speed.

According to the opinion of the famous Soviet technical doctor Pokrovsky, there are roughly two situations for manufacturing artificial satellites. One is artificial satellites without instruments, and people can observe their movement from the ground. This type of satellite is launched into the sky using rockets and then explodes in high altitude and is ejected. This type of satellite is generally much smaller, so manufacturing is also much easier.

The other type of artificial satellite is equipped with instruments. This type of satellite is larger and heavier, so the explosion method cannot be used to obtain the required speed, but the multi-stage rocket method must be used to send it into high altitude. The multi-stage rocket method is an ideal proposed by the Russian scholar Tsiolkovsky as early as 1903.

As for the design schemes of artificial satellites, it is said that there is now more than one, with different weights and sizes. Some weigh only a few kilograms, and some can weigh several tons. For engineers, designers, and scientific workers, these design schemes are all realistically possible. That is to say, the artificial satellites in these designs are completely achievable.

    人造卫星的工作在苏联
    新华社驻莫斯科记者　李楠
    去年，苏联科学院成立了一个星际交通常设联合委员会。苏联的许多机械学、天文学、热力学、物理学方面的专家，以及苏联科学院和各加盟共和国的许多科学研究机构的人员参加了这个组织。这个组织的出现标明着星际交通已经有了解决的可能，它由幻想阶段逐步走向现实的阶段。
    放射人造卫星是实现星际交通问题的第一个步骤。这种人造卫星放射到四、五百乃至一千公里以上的高空，那里已经没有空气的阻力，并且以每秒7公里的速度转动。这时，人造卫星就会脱离地心吸力，不需要燃料，围绕着地球长期转动。这样，人们就无异获得了一座长期存在于高空的实验室，这座实验室对于高空实际情况的研究自然比在地面上远远地观察不知要丰富和精确多少。将来的星际交通就要靠人造卫星上的研究材料来解决。
    把一颗人造卫星放射到高空去当然不是一件依靠普通飞机或气球所办得到的事情。一般喷气式飞机和气球只能上升20多公里，而人造卫星必须要离开地面四、五百公里以上。放射人造卫星只有采取星际火箭的办法。
    苏联正在成功地解决着放射星际火箭的问题。星际交通常设联合委员会的学术秘书卡尔宾科最近对莫斯科一家报纸的记者说，苏联用无线电操纵的星际火箭曾经达到了几乎500公里的高空。装在上面的敏锐的仪器曾经记录了高空中的温度、压力等现象。
    值得指出的是已经有一些生物随着火箭被送到了高空，并且安全地回到了地上。这些生物在高空的情况曾经在地面上作了观察。据说，首先到天空去的是一只猴子。大概将来人们也会带着像这只猴子一样的装备进入高空。
    放到高空去的火箭可以获得许多有价值的科学资料，但是因为火箭只能在高空存在极短的时间，因此火箭上的纪录就只能是极短时间内的现象。随着火箭射出去的人造卫星却是一个长期的观察台。
    火箭把人造卫星带到高空以后，人造卫星还必须以每秒7公里的速度转动。苏联的学者在实验室中已经达到了超过这个速度几倍的速度。现在的问题是把这个实验室中制造出来的东西实际带到高空，以需要的速度转动起来。
    根据苏联著名技术博士波克罗夫斯基的意见，制造人造卫星大体上有两种情况，一种是不带仪器的人造卫星，人们可以在地面上观察它的运动情形，这种卫星利用火箭射到天上以后，在高空爆炸，抛射出来，这种卫星一般要小得多，因此制造也要容易得多。
    另外一种人造卫星是带有仪器的，这种卫星要大些和重些，因此不能采用爆炸的办法，以获得必须的速度，而必须采用多段火箭的办法，送上高空。多段火箭的办法是俄国学者泽沃尔科夫斯基早在1903年就已经提出来的理想。
    至于人造卫星的设计方案，据说，现在有不止一种，重量和大小各不一样，有的只有几公斤重，有的可以重到几吨。对于工程师、设计师和科学工作人员说来，这些设计方案都是具有现实的可能性的。这就是说，这些设计中的人造卫星都是完全可以实现的。
