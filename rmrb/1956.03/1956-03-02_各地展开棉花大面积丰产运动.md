Xinhua News Agency, March 1st -- A mass cotton bumper harvest campaign is unfolding extensively in cotton-producing provinces and regions across the country.  Jiangsu, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Hebei, Shaanxi, Gansu, Liaoning, and Beijing, a total of 9 provinces and cities, have proposed nearly 20 million mu of cotton fields for mass bumper harvests, with a target yield of 100 to 200 jin (lint cotton) per mu on 14 million mu of this land. Anyang and Chenliu counties in Henan, and Xiajin county in Shandong, have proposed carrying out county-wide mass cotton bumper harvest campaigns.  These 3 counties, with 1.37 million mu of cotton fields, are aiming for an average yield of over 100 jin (lint cotton) per mu.

This mass cotton bumper harvest campaign was initiated by 7 mass cotton bumper harvest demonstration sites, including the Anyang Cotton Farm in Henan, the Shanghai Farm, the Wuchang Cotton Farm in Hubei, the Linqing Cotton Farm in Shandong, the Yuncheng and Jingyang Experiment Stations in Shanxi and Shaanxi, and the Shijiazhuang General Experiment Station.  Since last December, cotton-producing provinces and regions have successively convened meetings with heads of agricultural production cooperatives in cotton-growing areas to discuss cotton production increase and technical exchange, specifically studying and learning from the advanced experiences and techniques of the Agricultural Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Cixi County of Zhejiang Province in achieving large-scale bumper harvests of double-cropping cotton fields. Subsequently, agricultural cooperatives in various cotton-producing areas, based on these advanced experiences, have carried out mass technical instruction and formulated detailed production plans.

    各地展开棉花大面积丰产运动
    据新华社1日讯　棉花大面积丰产运动正在全国产棉省区中广泛展开。江苏、山东、山西、河南、河北、陕西、甘肃、辽宁和北京等9个省、市提出的大面积丰产的棉田，已近2，000万亩，其中有1，400万亩的单位面积产量，要求达到100斤到200斤（皮棉）。河南的安阳、陈留和山东的夏津三县提出了开展全县棉田的大面积丰产运动。这3个县的137万亩棉田，每亩的平均产量都要求达到100斤以上（皮棉）。
    这个棉花大面积丰产运动是由河南安阳棉场、上海农场、湖北武昌棉场、山东临清棉场、山西运城和陕西泾阳试验站、石家庄试验总站等7个棉花大面积丰产示范点开始的。自去年12月以来，各产棉省、区都先后召开了有棉区农业生产合作社社长参加的棉花增产和技术交流等会议，具体研究和学习了中国人民解放军新疆军区农业生产建设部队和浙江省慈溪县两熟制棉田大面积丰产的先进经验和技术。此后，各产棉区的农业合作社根据这些先进经验，开展群众性的技术传授，并且制定详细的生产规划。
