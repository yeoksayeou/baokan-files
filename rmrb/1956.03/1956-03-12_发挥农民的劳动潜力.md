    Unleash the Labor Potential of Farmers
    In this year's spring plowing production, more than 85% of farmers will be engaged in production through unified management and collective labor, of which about half of the total number of farmers in the country will be engaged in production in advanced cooperatives where remuneration is based entirely on labor. The scale of the cooperatives is also much larger than in previous years. These facts show that in this year's spring plowing production, there is a much stronger force than last year that can be brought into play; at the same time, it also shows that the organization of labor and the management of production are particularly important and arduous tasks in this year's spring plowing production.
    Farmers have great labor potential. According to typical surveys in Gansu Province, male and female full laborers account for about 40% of the total agricultural population, but the utilization rate in the past was generally very low. If fully utilized, the working days of each male full laborer can be increased by 60 to 100 days per year, and the working days of each female full laborer can be increased by 30 to 50 days. This would increase working days by one-third.
    Farmers have a high level of enthusiasm for labor. This has been clearly demonstrated in the spring plowing preparations in various places. Many things that had never been done in the past during preparation for plowing have been done in the past few months.
    However, great labor potential does not mean that these labor forces can necessarily be brought into play under the current circumstances. High labor enthusiasm does not mean that labor efficiency is necessarily high. In fact, in many places, labor is still being buried, and in many places, there is a phenomenon of "high labor enthusiasm, low labor efficiency." The main reason is that the organization and management of labor have not been done well.
    To fully unleash the labor potential of agricultural producers' cooperatives, the most important tasks at present are: to do a good job of labor planning; to improve the leadership of production teams; to stipulate reasonable work quotas and remuneration standards; and to promote the contract labor system. These aspects are interconnected, and if one aspect is not done well, it will be difficult to do well in other aspects.
    Labor planning is an important part of production planning. Its main contents are labor force usage plans and labor-day expenditure plans. Its purpose is to improve the utilization rate of the labor force and labor productivity, so that everyone in the agricultural producers' cooperative who is able to work has appropriate work, and so that every working day of every person is used in the most effective place. To do a good job of labor planning, it is necessary to carefully calculate: according to the needs of the cooperative's development of production and the needs of the state in other areas, how much labor is needed for how many days of work in total, how much is needed in each area, and how much is needed in each season; according to actual possibilities, how many days of work can the cooperative's various labor forces do in total, how much can each type of labor force do, and how much can each do in each season. If the production plan does not have such a labor plan as its important content, it will become an empty plan without a foundation. At present, most agricultural producers' cooperatives have not yet formulated labor plans, and even those that have formulated labor plans are relatively crude and not comprehensive enough. Therefore, in the current work of consolidating agricultural cooperatives, doing a good job of labor planning should be regarded as one of the most important contents.
    The kind of production chaos that occurred when agricultural producers' cooperatives were first established in the past has been greatly reduced, relatively speaking, according to this year's situation of so many new cooperatives. Cadres and the masses have gained some experience in organizing production, and at the same time, with the old cooperatives as examples, production teams and production groups have been quickly established after the establishment of the cooperatives, and production responsibilities have been roughly divided. However, in this regard, there are still problems at present. Especially in the case of the large-scale emergence of large cooperatives with hundreds or even thousands of households, establishing labor organizations is a major task that needs to be closely watched. The problems that some agricultural producers' cooperatives currently have in terms of labor organization are: too many organizational levels, cumbersome management institutions, excessive dispersion of key personnel, and inconvenience in establishing a production responsibility system and giving play to the labor enthusiasm of the members. Matang Township in Wuhu, Anhui, has a large cooperative with 1,713 households. When it was first built, it was divided into 66 production teams. There were too many teams, and an "operation area" institution was added in the middle, dividing the production teams under the management of five "operation areas." In this way, the key personnel were too dispersed, the division of production responsibilities between the districts and teams was unclear, and the director of the "operation area" was unable to lead production. Later, the entire cooperative was divided into 16 production teams, and each team was further divided into groups as needed. In this way, the key personnel were more concentrated, and the normal order of production was quickly established. How should production teams be divided? How big is the most suitable for each team? This is closely related to production conditions (including land conditions, agricultural tool conditions, the types of crops and side occupations managed, etc.), key personnel conditions, and living conditions. Whether the division of production teams is appropriate or not has a great impact on whether production can be carried out well. Personnel leading agricultural producers' cooperatives in various places should conduct thorough investigations and research, and do this work effectively when consolidating agricultural producers' cooperatives.
    Correctly stipulating work quotas is the central link in doing a good job of labor management. With realistic and advanced work quotas, we can accurately formulate labor plans, reasonably calculate labor remuneration, and fully unleash the labor enthusiasm of the members and improve the quality of their work. Of course, it is indeed not very easy to stipulate work quotas correctly; however, some comrades see this work as overly difficult, and even start to worry about it, which is also incorrect. In fact, farmers know how much work they can do in a day. Relying on the masses to record their past personal experiences, and then conducting on-site experiments, the quotas for various tasks can be initially stipulated. If it is not very precise, it can be revised later. If it is not possible to stipulate the quotas for all kinds of work at once, the quotas for the most needed work in the current production can be stipulated first. New cooperatives have no experience and can learn from old cooperatives. If the situation in an area is similar, a unified quota plan can be formulated and sent to various cooperatives as a reference standard for flexible use. The Rural Work Department of the Guangxi Provincial Party Committee proposed a quota plan and sent it to all cooperatives in the province, which was revised and supplemented by each cooperative in conjunction with the actual situation as its own plan. The Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee stipulated that county, district or certain "zones" can be used as units to convene meetings of cooperative representatives to uniformly formulate local work quotas, and then each cooperative will consider adopting them. The Xingtai Prefectural Committee of Hebei first did a good job of work quotas in a dozen or so cooperatives with a relatively good foundation, and then used these dozen or so points as a basis to run work quota training classes. These are all methods to make this work proceed quickly and well.
    If production teams are divided reasonably, work quotas are stipulated correctly, and there is a realistic labor plan, it will be relatively easy to implement the contract labor system. What should be done when work quotas have not yet been stipulated? In order to quickly establish production order, it is also possible to estimate the amount of work and the labor remuneration that should be obtained for a certain period of time according to past experience to carry out contract labor. In many places, agricultural producers' cooperatives still adopt the method of temporary assignment and daily evaluation of work, and have not adopted even this elementary form of contract labor; or they are divorced from the current production, buried in stipulating work quotas, and underestimate this elementary form of contract labor. Both of these are incorrect. Newly established cooperatives, before they have stipulated precise and detailed work quotas, can also have great benefits by estimating rough quotas based on the experience of the masses to carry out contract labor. Of course, doing so cannot be very precise or very reasonable. Therefore, after implementing this elementary form of contract labor, attention should also be paid to grasping the work of stipulating work quotas and formulating labor plans, and these should be regarded as important contents for improving the original contract labor system, continuing to improve, and constantly moving forward.

### 发挥农民的劳动潜力

    发挥农民的劳动潜力
    在今年的春耕生产中，将要有85％以上的农民以统一经营集体劳动的方式进行生产，其中有约占全国农户总数一半的农民是在完全按劳取酬的高级社里进行生产。合作社的规模也比往年大得多。这些事实说明：在今年的春耕生产中，有比去年更强大得多的力量可以发挥出来；同时也说明：组织劳动、管理生产在今年的春耕生产中是特别重要而又繁重的工作。
    农民的劳动潜力是很大的。根据甘肃省的典型调查，男女全劳动力约占农业总人口的40％左右，而过去的利用率一般很低；如果充分加以利用，每个男子全劳动力的工作日每年可以增加60天到100天，每个女子全劳动力的工作日可以增加30天到50天。这就可以增加三分之一的工作日。
    农民的劳动热情是很高的。这在各地的春耕准备工作中明显地表现了出来。过去在备耕工作中从来没有办到过的许多事，这几个月都办到了。
    但是劳动潜力大，不等于说这些劳动力在目前的情况下就一定能发挥出来。劳动热情高，不等于说劳动效率也就一定很高。事实上，许多地方的劳动力仍然被埋没着，许多地方出现了“劳动热情高，劳动效率低”的现象。主要原因就在于劳动组织和管理工作没有做好。
    要使农业生产合作社的劳动潜力充分地发挥出来，当前最重要的工作是：做好劳动规划；改进生产队的领导；规定合理的工作定额和报酬标准；推行包工制。这几个方面是互相联系着的，一方面做不好，别的方面就很难做好。
    劳动规划是生产规划的一个重要部分。它的主要内容是劳动力使用计划和劳动日支出计划。它的目的是提高劳动力的利用率和劳动生产率，使农业生产合作社每个能劳动的人都有适当的工作，使每个人的每个工作日都用在最能发挥效用的地方。要做好劳动规划，就要周密地计算清楚：按照本社发展生产的需要和国家在别的方面的需要，总共有多少劳动力做多少天工作才够用，各方面各需要多少，各个季节各需要多少；按照实际的可能，本社的各种劳动力总共能做多少天工作，各种劳动力各能做多少，各个季节各能做多少。生产规划如果没有这样的劳动规划作为它的重要内容，就会成为空洞的没有基础的规划。现在，大部分农业生产合作社还没有制定劳动规划，就是已经制定了的劳动规划，也有许多是比较粗糙、不够全面的。因此在当前整顿农业社的工作中，应当把做好劳动规划作为一项最重要的内容。
    往年，农业生产合作社刚建立起来的时候发生的那种生产上的混乱现象，按照今年新社这样多的情况相对地说，是大大减少了。干部和群众在组织生产方面都有了一些经验，同时有了老社做榜样，建社以后很快就编制了生产队、生产组，大体划分了生产责任。但是，在这方面，目前也并不是没有问题了。特别是在几百户甚至几千户的大型社大量出现的情况下，建立劳动组织是一个需要密切注意的重大工作。当前一些农业生产合作社在劳动组织方面的问题是：组织层次过多，管理机构庞杂，骨干力量过于分散，不便于建立生产责任制和发挥社员的劳动积极性。安徽芜湖马塘乡有一个1，713户的大型社，初建成的时候分成了66个生产队；队太多了，中间又加上一层“作业区”的机构，把生产队划归五个“作业区”管理。这样，使骨干力量过于分散，区和队的生产责任划分不清，“作业区”主任无法领导生产。后来，全社分成了16个生产队，每队再按照需要分组。这样，骨干力量比较集中了，生产的正常秩序才很快地建立起来。生产队怎样划分？每个队多大最合适？这同生产条件（包括耕地情况、农具情况、经营的农作物和副业的种类等等）、骨干条件、居住条件都有密切的关系。生产队划分得适当不适当，对生产能不能很好地进行有很大的影响。各地领导农业生产合作社的人员应当进行周密的调查研究，在整顿农业生产合作社的时候，切实地作好这项工作。
    正确地规定工作定额，是做好劳动管理工作的中心一环。有了切合实际的先进的工作定额，才能准确地制定劳动规划，才能合理地计算劳动报酬，才能充分地发挥社员的劳动积极性和提高社员的工作质量。当然，工作定额要规定得正确的确不十分容易；可是，有些同志把这个工作看得过分困难，甚至为它发起愁来，那也是不对的。其实，一天能做多少工作，农民心里有底；依靠群众把他们过去亲身的体验记录下来，再经过实地试验，就可以把各种工作的定额做出初步规定。不十分精确，以后可以再修正。不能一下子把各种工作的定额都规定出来，可以把当前生产中最需要的先规定出来。新社没有经验，可以向老社学习。一个地区情况相差不多的，可以统一规定定额方案，发给各个社作为参考标准，灵活使用。广西省委农村工作部提出了定额方案，发给全省各社，由各社结合实际情况修订补充作为本社的方案。江苏省委规定，可以以县、区或一定的“片”为单位，召开社代表会议，统一制定当地的工作定额，然后由各社斟酌采用。河北邢台地委先在十几个基础比较好的社作好工作定额的工作，然后以这十几个点为基础办工作定额训练班。这些都是使这个工作进行得又快又好的办法。
    生产队划分得合理，工作定额规定得正确，又有了切合实际的劳动规划，实行包工制就比较好办了。在还没有规定工作定额的时候应该怎么办呢？为了迅速建立生产秩序，也可以根据过去的经验估计出一个时期某种工作需要的工作量和应得的劳动报酬进行包工。有许多地方的农业生产合作社仍然采取临时派工、每天评工的办法，连这种初级形式的包工也没有采用；或者脱离当前的生产，埋头规定工作定额，过于轻视这种初级形式的包工。这都是不对的。初办的合作社，在没有规定出来精确详细的工作定额以前，根据群众的经验估计出粗略的定额进行包工，也有很大的好处。当然，这样做不可能很精确很合理。因此，实行了这种初级形式的包工以后，还应当注意抓住规定工作定额和制定劳动规划的工作，把这些作为改进原有的包工制度的重要内容，继续提高，不断前进。
