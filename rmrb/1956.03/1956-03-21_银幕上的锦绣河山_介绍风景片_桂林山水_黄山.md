    Splendid Rivers and Mountains on the Silver Screen
    —Introducing the Scenery Films "Guilin Landscape" and "Huangshan"—
    Su Fang
    People know the beauty of Lushan Waterfall and the moonlit night on Tiantai Mountain from Li Bai's poems, appreciate the spring rain on the Li River from Xu Beihong's paintings, and imagine the sea of clouds on Huangshan Mountain and the misty waves of Dongting Lake from the writings of more poets and painters... However, only a few people can personally visit the famous mountains and rivers of the motherland. However, the films "Guilin Landscape" and "Huangshan" produced by the Shanghai Science and Education Film Studio allow us to see these two places on the screen, allowing us to see their varied and picturesque scenery.
    "Guilin Landscape" and "Huangshan" are two very beautiful color scenery films. The films use bright and harmonious colors, novel and beautiful pictures, and simple and vivid explanatory words to present the mountains and rivers of Guilin and the scenery of Huangshan in a concentrated way before us. Here we see the Guilin mountains competing for beauty: Elephant Trunk Hill looks just like an elephant with its long trunk lowered to drink water by the river, Old Man Hill looks just like the profile of an old man in his twilight years, and Bilian Peak looks just like a lotus flower about to bloom, peeking out of the water... The Li River that appears in the film is so beautiful! It meanders between the mountains, gently rippling with silvery light waves. The water and mountains make people feel refreshed and happy. At this time, we will also agree that Han Yu's poem "The water is like a green silk ribbon, and the mountains are like jasper hairpins" is an accurate description of the landscape of Guilin. Guilin is not only beautiful but also a place rich in products. The abundant schools of fish floating in the shallow shoals and the plump pomelos laden with fruit on the green branches are well-known products throughout the country.
    In the film "Huangshan," we see Huangshan's famous "three wonders"—strange rocks, strange pines, and strange clouds—and we also see the famous peaks such as Tiandu, Yuping, and Lotus, and many strangely shaped rocks, which transform into various strange images, each with different postures. The ancient pines, vigorous and verdant, have been stretching out their long branches for a thousand years, welcoming travelers from afar. The continuous layers of clouds rise and surge like the waves of the sea. These beautiful and magnificent sceneries are enough to enrich our imagination and broaden our minds.
    In the dark years of reactionary rule, the people had little opportunity to access these famous scenic spots; only today can the people freely visit the great rivers and mountains. The film also shows this fundamental change. We can see how happily people are rowing boats on the Guilin River, enjoying the picturesque scenery on both sides; how comfortably people come and go on the top of Huangshan, looking at the scenery in the distance; and next to Peach Blossom Creek in Huangshan, a sanatorium is also being built, preparing to allow hard-working people to come here for a short rest. Looking at these moving scenes, looking at these wonderful sceneries, we will deeply feel how rich and beautiful our motherland is, and we will also deeply feel the pride and honor of being a people of the new China!
    The audience welcomes excellent scenery films like "Guilin Landscape" and "Huangshan" because they not only enrich people's geographical knowledge and natural science knowledge, but more importantly, the films vividly present the real face of our motherland's splendid rivers and mountains on the screen, allowing people to experience the greatness and loveliness of the motherland through concrete images, thereby loving the motherland more and better defending and building the motherland. Scenery film is a new theme in the field of Chinese film art, and its output is still not very large at present. Following the production of "Guilin Landscape" and "Huangshan," the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio will also shoot short films such as winter in the Himalayan region and the famous Himalayan pine forests. In the future, this type of film will gradually increase. The audience is delighted by the gradually widening scope of film art themes, and they also eagerly look forward to seeing scenery films about the Great Wall, the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River, Wutai Mountain, Emei Mountain, Dongting Lake, Taihu Lake, and other places on the screen one after another.

    银幕上的锦绣河山
    ——介绍风景片“桂林山水”“黄山”——
    苏方
    人们从李白的诗句里知道庐山瀑布和天台山月夜的美，从徐悲鸿的画幅上领略漓江的春雨，从更多的诗人、画家笔下想像黄山的云海和洞庭湖的烟波，……可是，能够亲自游览祖国名山大川的，毕竟只有少数人。然而，上海科学教育电影制片厂摄制的影片“桂林山水”和“黄山”，却使我们从银幕上看到这两处地方，使我们看到了它们的千姿万态、美丽如画的风貌。
    “桂林山水”和“黄山”是两部非常优美的彩色风景片。影片以鲜明而协调的色彩，新颖美丽的画面，配合着浅显生动的说明词，把桂林的山水和黄山的景色集中地展现在我们面前。在这里我们看到了桂林群山争奇竞秀的情态：象鼻山恰像一只垂下长鼻在江边饮水的大象，老人山恰像一个老态龙钟的老人的侧影，碧莲峰恰像一朵探头出水的含苞欲放的荷花……。影片里面出现的漓江，又是多么美丽啊！它蜿蜒回流在群山之间，微微地颤动着银色的光波。水光山色，真使人心旷神怡。这时，我们也就会同意韩愈的“水作青罗带，山如碧玉簪”的诗句，正是对桂林山水的准确的描写。桂林不但景色美丽，而且是一个物产丰富的地方。出现在影片里面的浮游在浅水滩上的繁多的鱼群，和绿树枝头结实累累的肥美的柚子，就是全国闻名的产品。
    在“黄山”一片中，我们看到了黄山的著名的“三奇”——奇石、奇松、奇云，也看到了天都、玉屏、莲花等著名山峰和许多奇形怪状的石头，它们幻化出各种奇异的形象，姿态也各不相同。苍劲葱郁的古松，一千年来，老是伸展出长长的枝干，欢迎远方来的旅客。连绵不断的云层，像大海的波涛一样起伏澎湃。这些美丽壮观的景色，都足以丰富我们的想像，扩大我们的胸怀。
    在反动统治的黑暗年代里，人民是少有机会接触这些著名的风景区的；只有今天，人民才能自由地去游览大好河山。影片里面也显示了这种根本的变化。我们可以看到：人们如何愉快地在桂林的河水上划着小船，欣赏着两岸的如画的风景；人们如何安适地在黄山顶上来来去去，眺望着远处的景物；而在黄山的桃花溪旁，还在修盖着休养所，准备让辛勤劳动的人们到这儿来作短暂的休憩。看着这些动人的情景，看着这一处处奇妙的景色，我们会深深地感到祖国是多么富饶美丽，我们也会深深地感到作为一个新中国人民的骄傲和自豪！
    观众很欢迎“桂林山水”和“黄山”这样优秀的风景片，因为它不仅使人们丰富了地理知识和自然科学知识，更重要的，是影片将我们祖国锦绣河山的真实面貌生动地在银幕上表现了出来，使人们通过具体的形象体会到祖国的伟大可爱，从而更加热爱祖国，更好地去保卫祖国和建设祖国。风景片是我国电影艺术领域里的一种新的题材，目前它的产量还不太多。随着“桂林山水”和“黄山”的摄制，中央新闻纪录电影制片厂也将拍摄喜马拉雅山区的冬天和著名的喜马拉雅松林等短片。今后这种类型的影片就将逐渐增多起来了。观众为电影艺术题材范围的日渐宽广而喜悦，他们也热烈地期望着能从银幕上陆续看到关于万里长城、长江三峡、五台山、峨眉山、洞庭湖、太湖等的风景片。
