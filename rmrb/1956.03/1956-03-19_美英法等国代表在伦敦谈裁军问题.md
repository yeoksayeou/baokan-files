Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Canada, members of the United Nations Disarmament Commission's Subcommittee, have been holding talks in London for several days. The meeting of the Disarmament Subcommittee is scheduled to open in London on March 19. It is known that the Soviet Union will also send a representative to participate in this meeting.

The British "Daily Telegraph and Morning Post" stated, "Britain, France, and the United States are consulting to formulate a common approach to disarmament policy before meeting with Russia in London on March 19."

As can be seen from Reuters reports, the United States is unwilling to accept this plan. Reuters reported, "The Western representatives attending the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee meeting have not been able to eliminate differences in opinion in order to form a united front in the upcoming talks with Russia."

    美英法等国代表在伦敦谈裁军问题
    据新华社讯　英国、美国、法国和加拿大四国出席联合国裁军委员会小组委员会的代表已经在伦敦举行了几天的会谈。裁军小组委员会的会议定于3月19日在伦敦开幕，大家知道，苏联也将派代表参加这次会议。
    英国“每日电讯与晨邮报”说，“英、法、美三国为了3月19日在伦敦同俄国会晤之前拟定它们对裁军问题政策的共同方针而进行磋商。”
    从路透社的报道中可以看出，美国不愿意接受这个计划。路透社报道说，“出席联合国裁军小组委员会会议的西方代表没有能够消除看法上的分歧，以便在即将举行的同俄国的会谈中形成统一阵线。”
