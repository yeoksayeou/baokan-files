Xinhua News Agency, 11th. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued the following statement on March 11, 1956:

    The Ministry of Foreign affairs of the People's Republic of China deems it necessary to issue another statement to expose the arbitrary distortion of facts in the U.S. State Department's statement of March 6.
    China has faithfully implemented the agreement on the repatriation of civilians of both sides. It is the United States that has failed to implement this agreement, and even violated it.
    The Chinese side provided the U.S. side with a complete list and information of all American residents and American prisoners in China long ago; however, the U.S. side has so far refused to provide the Chinese side with a list and information of Chinese residents in the United States.
    Among the 59 ordinary American residents in China, all 13 who requested to return home have already returned, and the remaining 46 can also leave at any time; however, Chinese in the United States are subjected to all kinds of threats and obstructions, including being forced to apply for permanent residence in the United States as refugees and obtain Taiwan entry permits, with the result that tens of thousands of Chinese who are willing to return to their motherland cannot return, including the 32 who the U.S. side itself admits are being prevented from returning and the 42 that the Chinese side specifically requested the U.S. side to account for.
    Of the 40 Americans who violated Chinese law in China, the Chinese government has released and deported 27 ahead of schedule; however, the U.S. government has so far taken no corresponding measures with regard to the Chinese imprisoned in the United States.
    Americans in China can contact the British Chargé d'Affaires in China, and the British Chargé d'Affaires in China has also issued them relevant notices regarding the agreement; however, the U.S. government has not provided the Indian Embassy in the United States with the necessary facilitation in assisting Chinese residents to return to their country, and even does not allow the Indian Embassy in the United States to issue announcements regarding assisting Chinese residents to return to their country.
    All these facts irrefutably expose the distortion of the U.S. State Department.
    As for the issuance of a statement by both China and the United States on the non-use of force against each other, the Chinese side has repeatedly stated its position. The Chinese government has consistently advocated resolving international disputes by peaceful means, without resorting to force. However, it must be pointed out that the United States has already used force to seize China's Taiwan, and is also using the threat of force to interfere with China's liberation of its coastal islands. Therefore, any meaningful statement by China and the United States on the non-use of force against each other must lead to a peaceful resolution of this dispute caused by the United States, and the lifting of the force and threat of force already used by the United States against China. However, the U.S. side refuses to express a positive attitude towards the proposal to hold a meeting of the foreign ministers of China and the United States to peacefully resolve the dispute between the two countries in the Taiwan area, and even demands the right to exercise so-called individual or collective self-defense in Taiwan, which is Chinese territory. This cannot but lead people to believe that the goal pursued by the United States is not to peacefully resolve the dispute between China and the United States, but to demand that China de facto recognize the status quo of the United States' occupation of Taiwan and interference with China's liberation of its coastal islands.
    The United States not only violates the agreements already reached and obstructs further progress in the Sino-American talks, but also intensifies military activities in the Taiwan area. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers it necessary to point out that the United States must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising from this situation.

Xinhua News Agency, 11th. The United States Information Service published on March 6 the U.S. State Department's official commentary on the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China on March 4 regarding the Sino-American talks. In this commentary, the U.S. State Department continues to insist on the unreasonable claims it made in its statement of January 21, which make it impossible for the Sino-American talks to achieve progress. The full text of the commentary is as follows:
    "The statement issued by the CCP on March 4 includes nothing new. However, it cannot be ignored that it makes no mention of the fact that the CCP is still imprisoning 13 Americans, even though they agreed last September—six months ago—to allow these Americans to exercise their right to return to the United States 'as soon as possible'. This only re-emphasizes and demonstrates that these Americans are being detained as political hostages.
    "The U.S. response on January 21 to a similar statement issued by the CCP on January 18 can equally be applied to respond to this statement by the Communists on March 4. The final few paragraphs of that reply read as follows:
    "1. Four months after the Communists announced they would take measures to allow Americans in China to return to the United States, 13 Americans are still being held in Communist prisons.
    "2. The United States suggests both sides declare a renunciation of the use of force without prejudice to the right of individual and collective self defense against armed attack, so that talks can proceed without the threat of war.
    "3. The United States has indicated that this renunciation of the use of force will not prejudice either side in pursuing its goals and policies by peaceful means.
    "4. Although the Communists say they accept the principle of renunciation of the use of force, they refuse to agree that this is without prejudice to the right of individual and collective self-defense against armed attack and applicable to the Taiwan area, thereby invalidating this acceptance.
    "In short, so far, the Communists seem to be willing to renounce the use of force only if the goal they want to achieve by using force is first recognized.
    "The United States, for its part, intends to adhere to peaceful methods. We seek the Chinese Communist Party to fulfill its long-overdue guarantee: to promptly allow Americans currently in China to return home. We pursue this goal not only for humanitarian reasons, but also out of respect for international obligations, which constitute the basis of a stable international order. We will steadfastly seek a meaningful renunciation of the use of force, especially in the Taiwan area."

### 中华人民共和国外交部发表声明  揭露美国国务院在3月6日的声明中对事实的任意歪曲

    中华人民共和国外交部发表声明
    揭露美国国务院在3月6日的声明中对事实的任意歪曲
    新华社11日讯　中华人民共和国外交部在1956年3月11日发表声明如下：
    中华人民共和国外交部认为有必要再次发表声明，来揭露美国国务院在3月6日的声明中对事实的任意歪曲。
    中国忠实地执行了关于双方平民回国问题的协议。没有执行这一协议、甚至违反这一协议的，正是美国。
    中国方面早就向美方提供了全部在华美侨和美国犯人的名单和情况；但是，美方至今拒绝向中国方面提供在美国的中国侨民的名单和情况。
    在中国的59名一般美侨中，要求回国的13名已经全部回国，其余的46名也可以随时离境；但是，在美国的中国人却受到种种的威胁和阻挠，包括被迫申请作为难民在美国永久居留和领取台湾入境证，以致成千上万愿意回国的中国人不能回到祖国，其中包括美方自己承认被阻不能回国的32人和中国方面具体要求美方交代的42人。
    对于在中国犯法的40名美国人，中国政府已经提前释放和遣送出境了27名；但是，对于被监禁在美国的中国人，美国政府至今没有采取任何相应的措施。
    在中国的美国人都可以同联合王国驻华代办处联系，联合王国驻华代办处也已经向他们发出了有关协议的通知；但是，美国政府却没有使印度驻美大使馆在协助中国侨民回国方面得到必要的便利，甚至不允许印度驻美大使馆发表有关协助中国侨民回国的公告。
    所有这些事实无可辩驳地戳穿了美国国务院的歪曲。
    至于由中美双方发表互不使用武力的声明，中国方面已经一再表示了它的立场。中国政府一贯主张用和平方式解决国际争端，而不诉诸武力。但是，必须指出，美国已经使用了武力霸占中国的台湾，并且还用武力威胁干涉中国解放沿海岛屿。因此，中美双方关于互不使用武力的任何有意义的声明，都必须导致美国所造成的这一争端的和平解决，解除美国对中国已经使用了的武力和武力威胁。但是，美国方面对于举行中美外长会议以和平解决两国在台湾地区的争端的建议拒绝表示肯定的态度，甚至还要求在中国的领土台湾有行使所谓单独或集体自卫的权利。这就不能不使人认为，美国所追求的目的不是和平解决中美两国之间的争端，而是要求中国在事实上承认美国侵占台湾和干涉中国解放沿海岛屿的现状。
    美国不仅违反已经达成的协议，阻挠中美会谈进一步获得进展，而且还在台湾地区加紧进行军事活动。中国外交部认为有必要指出，由于这种情况而产生的一切后果，必须由美国承担全部责任。
    新华社11日讯　美国新闻处3月6日发表了美国国务院对中华人民共和国外交部3月4日关于中美会谈的声明的官方评论。美国国务院在这篇评论中继续坚持它在1月21日声明中提出的那些使中美会谈无法获致进展的无理主张。评论全文如下：
    “中共在3月4日发表的声明没有包括任何新的东西。然而不能忽视这一点：它连提都没有提到中共仍然监禁着13名美国人，尽管他们在去年9月——6个月以前——同意将‘尽速’准许这些美国人行使他们的返回美国的权利。这只是重新强调表明了：这些美国人是被作为政治人质而拘留着的。
    “美国在1月21日对中共在1月18日发表的一篇类似的声明的答复同样可以适用于答复共产党3月4日的这篇声明。那篇答复的最后几段文如下：
    “一、在共产党人宣布他们将采取措施允许在中国的美国人返回美国4个月之后，仍然有13名美国人被监禁在共产党监狱中。
    “二、美国建议，双方在不损害对武装进攻进行单独和集体自卫的权利的情况下宣布放弃使用武力，以便会谈可以在没有战争威胁的情况下进行。
    “三、美国已经表明，这种放弃使用武力将不损害任何一方在以和平办法追求它的目标和政策。
    “四、虽然共产党人说，他们接受放弃使用武力的原则，但是他们却拒绝同意，这是不损害对武装进攻进行单独和集体自卫的权利和适用于台湾地区的，从而使这种接受失去了价值。
    “总之，到现在为止，共产党人似乎只有在他们要使用武力达到的那个目标首先得到承认的情况下才愿意放弃使用武力。
    “美国在它这一方面，打算坚持用和平方法。我们寻求中国共产党履行他们早该履行的保证：就是迅速允许目前在中国的美国人回国。我们追求这个目的不仅是为了人道的理由，而且是由于尊重构成稳定的国际秩序的基础的国际义务。我们将坚定地寻求一种有意义的放弃使用武力，特别是在台湾地区。”
