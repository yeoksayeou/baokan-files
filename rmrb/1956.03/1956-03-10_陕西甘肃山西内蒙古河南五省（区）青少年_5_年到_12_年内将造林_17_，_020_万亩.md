Youth in Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and Henan Provinces (Regions)
170.2 Million Mu to Be Afforested in 5 to 12 Years

    More than 23 million young people and children in Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and Henan provinces (regions) will complete over 50% of the total afforestation target of the five provinces (regions), planting 170.2 million mu of trees during the 5 to 12 years starting from 1956. This figure was announced in the afforestation planning reports submitted by the heads of the Communist Youth League organizations of the five provinces (regions) to the Five Provinces (Regions) Youth Afforestation Conference on the 5th.
    The planning reports announced that the total afforestation area in the five provinces (regions) in the next 5 to 12 years will reach 320.07 million mu, and the area of hillsides closed for afforestation and cultivation in Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, and Inner Mongolia alone will be 113.51 million mu. After the completion of this grand plan, the total forest area of the five provinces (regions) will reach 707.5 million mu. By then, the entire Loess Plateau will be shaded with trees, the threat of wind, sand, water, and drought disasters will be greatly reduced, and the lifespan of the Sanmenxia Reservoir and other large reservoirs in the Yellow River Basin can also be greatly extended.
    The planning reports of the Communist Youth League organizations of the five provinces (regions) pointed out that in the past few years, the five provinces (regions) have carried out large-scale afforestation campaigns, planting a total of more than 8.43 million mu of trees, closing hillsides for afforestation and cultivation of more than 7.16 million mu, and also constructing a large number of gully dams, silt-trapping dams, terraces, and slope protection projects for soil and water conservation. According to incomplete statistics, more than 8.6 million young people and children have been involved in this campaign in the five provinces (regions) since last winter, with an afforestation area of over 1 million mu. As of last year, the Northwest Loess Plateau had controlled soil erosion over an area of more than 70,000 square kilometers. The scouring phenomenon that occurred during heavy rains in many places has been reduced, and the disasters of wind and sand burying villages and farmland have stopped. Land near forest belts that could not grow wheat in the past can now grow wheat; the yield of general crops has increased by one to three times. The 690,000 mu of forest networks and belts built in eastern and northern Henan Province have freed more than 1.8 million mu of cultivated land from wind and sand disasters.
    The greening plans of the Communist Youth League organizations of the five provinces (regions) are all determined to serve the great plan of controlling the Yellow River's water hazards and developing the Yellow River's water resources, which is their main goal. The plans propose a series of measures to create riparian forests, water source forests, and soil and water conservation forests on the Yellow River and its main tributaries. In Gansu Province, at the upper reaches of the Yellow River's middle reaches, the youth of the province will complete the 988-kilometer-long riparian forest along the main stream of the Yellow River within the province in two years, starting in 1956, and complete the riparian forest along the main tributaries of the Yellow River in the province within three years. In the southwestern part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, young people and children will participate in building the Yellow River Security Forest, which includes 31 banners, counties, cities, and mining areas, covering an area of nearly 30 million mu. In Shaanxi Province on the west bank of the Yellow River, young people and children will build 110,000 water source forests, embankment protection forests, and riparian forests with an area of more than 10 mu each along the Jing River, Wei River, Yan River, Luo River, Wuding River, and other Yellow River tributaries. In Shanxi Province on the east bank of the Yellow River, young people and children will widely create youth forests along the Yellow River and its tributaries Fen River, Qin River, and other major rivers within the province, and in the Lüliang Mountains, Zhongtiao Mountains, Taihang Mountains, and other places within the province. In Henan Province at the lower reaches of the Yellow River's middle reaches, young people and children will participate in completing the afforestation activities to green the upper reaches of the Sanmenxia Reservoir and its surroundings before 1958, and the afforestation activities to green the main tributaries of the Yellow River, such as the Yi River, Luo River, and Qin River, before 1960.
    In order to defend against the invasion of wind and sand from the north, the youth of Gansu Province will participate in building a sand prevention forest belt that will be completed in 12 years, starting from Anxi in the west and extending to Yanchi in the east, with a total length of 4,600 li and a width of 3 li. The youth of northern Shaanxi will build a "Green Great Wall" along the 1,300-li-long Great Wall from Dingbian in the west to Fugou in the east within 10 years, creating a wind and sand prevention forest every year. The youth and children of Inner Mongolia will cooperate with the youth and children of northern Shaanxi to create a 4,000-li-long sand-fixation forest belt around the vast desert with a total area of about 120 million mu in the Yikezhao League in southwestern Inner Mongolia; at the same time, they will participate in building the eastern protection forest belt spanning 10 banners and counties, 800 li long, 600 li wide, and covering an area of 16.05 million mu. These forest belts, when connected in the future, will form a real "Great Green Wall" in northern China from Gansu through Shaanxi to the eastern part of Inner Mongolia, protecting farmland in a vast area of hundreds of thousands of square kilometers from wind and sand disasters.
    The youth of Gansu Province also undertook the task of greening both sides of the Xilan Highway, Tianlan, and Baotian railways within the province in two years, and ensuring that the main and branch lines of the Lanxin and Baolan railways are built there within two years and greened there. The youth of Shanxi Province also proposed to green both sides of the railways, highways, and main roads in the province within two years, connecting them to become a "Youth Greening Road" with a total length of 25,000 li, and proposed to green the cities of Taiyuan and Datong as soon as possible. The youth and children in Hanzhong and other areas of Shaanxi Province will build 10,000 economic forests and timber forests with an area of more than 100 mu each within two years, and the youth and children on both sides of the Han River will green both sides of the Han River within two years. The youth of Henan Province will fully undertake the glorious task of greening the deep mountainous areas lacking labor.
    The plans of the Communist Youth League organizations of the five provinces (regions) all put forward specific measures to ensure the victorious realization of the plan to green the Loess Plateau. The Communist Youth League organizations of the five provinces (regions) decided to establish forestry committees in the grassroots organizations of the League to specifically lead this work. Gansu Province also decided to establish afforestation headquarters at the provincial, county, and township levels, and establish teams and groups for afforestation, forest protection, quality inspection, seed collection, and seedling cultivation in the headquarters at the township level. This spring, the five provinces (regions) will launch a large-scale publicity campaign to widely publicize the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao on greening the country, publicize the spirit of the Youth Afforestation Conference of the five provinces (regions), and convene youth afforestation conferences in counties (banners) and townships as units. Shanxi Province has already started a tree planting and afforestation publicity month in mid-February, and Shaanxi Province is about to have a publicity army of 200,000 young people, going deep into more than 6,000 townships and all factories, mines, schools, and institutions in the province to publicize and mobilize afforestation. In the spring and autumn seasons of each year in the future, the five provinces (regions) will respectively select one month or ten days, one week of time, as the youth tree planting and afforestation shock campaign month or ten days, week, mobilizing and organizing more than 23 million young people and children to shock afforestation. In order to achieve self-collection, self-cultivation, self-construction, and self-protection, various places will widely mobilize young people and children to collect tree seeds, and young people and children in areas with abundant seed sources will also donate surplus seeds to pastoral areas and desert areas lacking tree seeds. Various places should also establish youth and children's nurseries and seedling cultivation groups in agricultural production cooperatives, and establish forest protection organizations. In the plan, the five provinces (regions) all focused on proposing a plan to organize young people to learn afforestation techniques. This year, agricultural production cooperatives in various places will select young people to participate in forestry technology training courses organized by the forestry departments; by next year, the five provinces (regions) will cultivate at least 300,000 young foresters and seedling cultivators, so that each youth and children's afforestation organization has its own technicians. The youth in various places will also sign technology transfer contracts with forestry stations, forest farms, state-owned nurseries, etc., establish self-study groups, and regularize technical learning. Henan Province is preparing to organize 30,000 Michurin research groups in the next two years, which will gradually develop into forestry technology night schools. The Communist Youth League organizations and forestry departments of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Henan Province will also compile and print the experience of local people in planting trees and afforestation into books and vigorously promote it.

    陕西甘肃山西内蒙古河南五省（区）青少年
    5年到12年内将造林17，020万亩
    陕西、甘肃、山西、内蒙古、河南5省（区）2，300多万青年和少年，将分别在从1956年起的5年到12年期间，完成5省（区）植树造林总指标的50％以上，造林17，020万亩。这个数字是在5省（区）青年团组织负责人5日分别向5省（区）青年造林大会提出的植树造林的规划报告中所宣布的。
    这些规划报告中所宣布的5省（区）在今后5年到12年内植树造林的总面积达32，007万亩，封山育林仅陕西、甘肃、山西和内蒙古4个省（区）就有11，351万亩。在这个宏伟的计划完成后，5省（区）的森林总面积将达到70，750万亩。那时，整个黄土高原将到处绿树成荫，风沙和水、旱灾害的威胁将大大地减少，三门峡水库和黄河流域的其他大型水库的寿命也可以大大地延长。
    5省（区）青年团组织的规划报告指出，过去几年来，5省（区）已经进行了大规模的植树造林运动，造林共达843万多亩，封山育林716万多亩，同时还兴修了大批的谷坊、拦淤坝、梯田、护坡等水土保持工程。据不完全统计，去年冬季以来5省（区）投入这一运动的青年和少年有860多万人，造林面积超过了100万亩。截至去年为止，西北黄土高原已经控制住7万多平方公里的水土流失，许多地方在大雨的时候所发生的冲刷现象减轻了，风沙压没村庄和农田的灾害也停止了。林带附近以往不能种麦子的土地，也能种麦子了；一般农作物的产量提高了一倍到三倍。河南省豫东和豫北造的69万亩林网、林带，已经使180多万亩耕地摆脱了风沙灾害。
    5省（区）青年团组织的绿化规划，都确定为根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的伟大计划服务，是它们的一个主要目标。规划中提出了在黄河和它的主要支流上营造护岸林、水源林、水土保持林等一系列的措施。在黄河中游最上端的甘肃省，全省青年将从1956年起在两年内完成境内全长988公里的黄河主流护岸林，3年内完成全省黄河主要支流的护岸林。在内蒙古自治区的西南部，青年和少年们将参加营造包括31个旗、县、市和矿区，面积近3，000万亩的黄河保安林。在黄河西岸的陕西省，青年和少年们将在泾河、渭河、延河、洛河、无定河及其他黄河支流营造11万处面积在10亩以上的水源林、护堤林和护岸林。在黄河东岸的山西省，青年和少年们将在黄河和它的支流汾河、沁河和境内其他主要河流，和在境内的吕梁山、中条山、太行山等处，普遍地营造青年林。在黄河中游下端的河南省，青年和少年们将参加在1958年以前完成绿化三门峡水库上游和它的周围的造林活动，和在1960年以前绿化伊、洛、沁等黄河主要支流的造林活动。
    为了防御从北方来的风沙的侵袭，甘肃省的青年将参加营造在12年内完成的西起安西东到盐池，全长4，600华里、宽3华里的防沙林带。陕北青年将在西起定边东至府谷长达1，300华里的长城沿线上，在10年内每年营造一道防风、防沙的“绿长城”。内蒙古的青年和少年将配合陕北地区的青年和少年，在内蒙古西南部的伊克昭盟总面积约12，000万亩的大沙漠周围，营造一条长4，000华里的固沙林带；同时将参加营造横跨10个旗、县、长800华里、宽600华里、面积达1，605万亩的东部防护林带。这几条林带在将来连接起来以后，就将在我国北部从甘肃经过陕西延伸到内蒙古的东部，形成一条真正的“万里绿长城”，保卫几十万平方公里的广大地区的农田，免受风沙灾害的侵袭。
    甘肃省青年还承担了两年内绿化境内的西兰公路、天兰和宝天等铁路两侧的任务，和保证兰新、包兰铁路的干支线两年内修到那里，就绿化到那里。山西省青年也提出要在两年内绿化全省的铁路、公路和大车路的两旁，把它们连接起来成为全长25，000华里的“青年绿化路”，并且提出要尽快地绿化太原、大同等城市。陕西省汉中等地区的青年和少年将要在两年内营造1万处面积在百亩以上的经济林和用材林，汉江两岸的青年和少年将在两年内绿化汉江两岸。河南省的青年们将全部承担起绿化缺乏劳动力的深山区的光荣任务。
    5省（区）青年团组织的规划都提出了保证胜利实现绿化黄土高原的规划的具体措施。5省（区）青年团组织决定在团的基层组织中，普遍设立林业委员，专门领导这一项工作。甘肃省还决定成立省、县、乡的造林指挥部，在乡一级的指挥部中设立造林、护林、质量检查、采种、育苗等队、组。今年春天，5省（区）都将开展一个规模宏大的宣传运动，广泛宣传中共中央和毛主席关于绿化全国的指示，宣传5省（区）青年造林大会的精神，并且普遍以县（旗）、乡为单位召开青年造林大会。山西全省已经在2月中旬开始举行植树造林宣传月，陕西省即将有20万青年组成的宣传大军，深入全省6，000多个乡和所有厂矿、学校、机关中，宣传和动员造林。在今后每年春、秋两季，5省（区）将分别选择一个月或一旬、一周时间，作为青年植树造林突击运动月或旬、周，动员和组织两千三百多万青年和少年突击造林。为了做到自采、自育、自造、自护，各地将广泛动员青年和少年采集树种，在种源丰富的地区的青年和少年们还将把多余的树种赠给缺少树种的牧区和沙漠地区。各地还要在农业生产合作社中建立青年和少年苗圃和育苗小组，并且建立护林组织。在规划中，5省 （区）都着重提出组织青年学习造林技术的计划。今年，各地的农业生产合作社都将选派青年参加林业部门举办的林业技术训练班；到明年，5省（区）至少要培育出30多万名青年林业员和育苗员，使每个青年和少年造林组织中都有自己的技术员。各地青年还将和林业站、林场、国营苗圃等部门，订立技术传授包教保学合同，成立自学小组，把技术学习经常化。河南省准备在今明两年内组织起3万个米丘林研究小组，这些小组将逐步发展为林业技术夜校。内蒙古自治区和河南省的青年团组织和林业部门还要把当地群众植树造林的经验编印成书，大力推广。　（新华社）
