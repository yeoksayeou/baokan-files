Youth in Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and Henan Provinces (Regions)
170.2 Million Mu to Be Afforested in 5 to 12 Years

    More than 23 million young people and children in Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and Henan provinces (regions) will complete over 50% of the total afforestation target of the five provinces (regions), planting 170.2 million mu of trees during the 5 to 12 years starting from 1956. This figure was announced in the afforestation planning reports submitted by the heads of the Communist Youth League organizations of the five provinces (regions) to the Five Provinces (Regions) Youth Afforestation Conference on the 5th.
    The planning reports announced that the total afforestation area in the five provinces (regions) in the next 5 to 12 years will reach 320.07 million mu, and the area of hillsides closed for afforestation and cultivation in Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, and Inner Mongolia alone will be 113.51 million mu. After the completion of this grand plan, the total forest area of the five provinces (regions) will reach 707.5 million mu. By then, the entire Loess Plateau will be shaded with trees, the threat of wind, sand, water, and drought disasters will be greatly reduced, and the lifespan of the Sanmenxia Reservoir and other large reservoirs in the Yellow River Basin can also be greatly extended.
    The planning reports of the Communist Youth League organizations of the five provinces (regions) pointed out that in the past few years, the five provinces (regions) have carried out large-scale afforestation campaigns, planting a total of more than 8.43 million mu of trees, closing hillsides for afforestation and cultivation of more than 7.16 million mu, and also constructing a large number of gully dams, silt-trapping dams, terraces, and slope protection projects for soil and water conservation. According to incomplete statistics, more than 8.6 million young people and children have been involved in this campaign in the five provinces (regions) since last winter, with an afforestation area of over 1 million mu. As of last year, the Northwest Loess Plateau had controlled soil erosion over an area of more than 70,000 square kilometers. The scouring phenomenon that occurred during heavy rains in many places has been reduced, and the disasters of wind and sand burying villages and farmland have stopped. Land near forest belts that could not grow wheat in the past can now grow wheat; the yield of general crops has increased by one to three times. The 690,000 mu of forest networks and belts built in eastern and northern Henan Province have freed more than 1.8 million mu of cultivated land from wind and sand disasters.
    The greening plans of the Communist Youth League organizations of the five provinces (regions) are all determined to serve the great plan of controlling the Yellow River's water hazards and developing the Yellow River's water resources, which is their main goal. The plans propose a series of measures to create riparian forests, water source forests, and soil and water conservation forests on the Yellow River and its main tributaries. In Gansu Province, at the upper reaches of the Yellow River's middle reaches, the youth of the province will complete the 988-kilometer-long riparian forest along the main stream of the Yellow River within the province in two years, starting in 1956, and complete the riparian forest along the main tributaries of the Yellow River in the province within three years. In the southwestern part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, young people and children will participate in building the Yellow River Security Forest, which includes 31 banners, counties, cities, and mining areas, covering an area of nearly 30 million mu. In Shaanxi Province on the west bank of the Yellow River, young people and children will build 110,000 water source forests, embankment protection forests, and riparian forests with an area of more than 10 mu each along the Jing River, Wei River, Yan River, Luo River, Wuding River, and other Yellow River tributaries. In Shanxi Province on the east bank of the Yellow River, young people and children will widely create youth forests along the Yellow River and its tributaries Fen River, Qin River, and other major rivers within the province, and in the LÃ¼liang Mountains, Zhongtiao Mountains, Taihang Mountains, and other places within the province. In Henan Province at the lower reaches of the Yellow River's middle reaches, young people and children will participate in completing the afforestation activities to green the upper reaches of the Sanmenxia Reservoir and its surroundings before 1958, and the afforestation activities to green the main tributaries of the Yellow River, such as the Yi River, Luo River, and Qin River, before 1960.
    In order to defend against the invasion of wind and sand from the north, the youth of Gansu Province will participate in building a sand prevention forest belt that will be completed in 12 years, starting from Anxi in the west and extending to Yanchi in the east, with a total length of 4,600 li and a width of 3 li. The youth of northern Shaanxi will build a "Green Great Wall" along the 1,300-li-long Great Wall from Dingbian in the west to Fugou in the east within 10 years, creating a wind and sand prevention forest every year. The youth and children of Inner Mongolia will cooperate with the youth and children of northern Shaanxi to create a 4,000-li-long sand-fixation forest belt around the vast desert with a total area of about 120 million mu in the Yikezhao League in southwestern Inner Mongolia; at the same time, they will participate in building the eastern protection forest belt spanning 10 banners and counties, 800 li long, 600 li wide, and covering an area of 16.05 million mu. These forest belts, when connected in the future, will form a real "Great Green Wall" in northern China from Gansu through Shaanxi to the eastern part of Inner Mongolia, protecting farmland in a vast area of hundreds of thousands of square kilometers from wind and sand disasters.
    The youth of Gansu Province also undertook the task of greening both sides of the Xilan Highway, Tianlan, and Baotian railways within the province in two years, and ensuring that the main and branch lines of the Lanxin and Baolan railways are built there within two years and greened there. The youth of Shanxi Province also proposed to green both sides of the railways, highways, and main roads in the province within two years, connecting them to become a "Youth Greening Road" with a total length of 25,000 li, and proposed to green the cities of Taiyuan and Datong as soon as possible. The youth and children in Hanzhong and other areas of Shaanxi Province will build 10,000 economic forests and timber forests with an area of more than 100 mu each within two years, and the youth and children on both sides of the Han River will green both sides of the Han River within two years. The youth of Henan Province will fully undertake the glorious task of greening the deep mountainous areas lacking labor.
    The plans of the Communist Youth League organizations of the five provinces (regions) all put forward specific measures to ensure the victorious realization of the plan to green the Loess Plateau. The Communist Youth League organizations of the five provinces (regions) decided to establish forestry committees in the grassroots organizations of the League to specifically lead this work. Gansu Province also decided to establish afforestation headquarters at the provincial, county, and township levels, and establish teams and groups for afforestation, forest protection, quality inspection, seed collection, and seedling cultivation in the headquarters at the township level. This spring, the five provinces (regions) will launch a large-scale publicity campaign to widely publicize the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao on greening the country, publicize the spirit of the Youth Afforestation Conference of the five provinces (regions), and convene youth afforestation conferences in counties (banners) and townships as units. Shanxi Province has already started a tree planting and afforestation publicity month in mid-February, and Shaanxi Province is about to have a publicity army of 200,000 young people, going deep into more than 6,000 townships and all factories, mines, schools, and institutions in the province to publicize and mobilize afforestation. In the spring and autumn seasons of each year in the future, the five provinces (regions) will respectively select one month or ten days, one week of time, as the youth tree planting and afforestation shock campaign month or ten days, week, mobilizing and organizing more than 23 million young people and children to shock afforestation. In order to achieve self-collection, self-cultivation, self-construction, and self-protection, various places will widely mobilize young people and children to collect tree seeds, and young people and children in areas with abundant seed sources will also donate surplus seeds to pastoral areas and desert areas lacking tree seeds. Various places should also establish youth and children's nurseries and seedling cultivation groups in agricultural production cooperatives, and establish forest protection organizations. In the plan, the five provinces (regions) all focused on proposing a plan to organize young people to learn afforestation techniques. This year, agricultural production cooperatives in various places will select young people to participate in forestry technology training courses organized by the forestry departments; by next year, the five provinces (regions) will cultivate at least 300,000 young foresters and seedling cultivators, so that each youth and children's afforestation organization has its own technicians. The youth in various places will also sign technology transfer contracts with forestry stations, forest farms, state-owned nurseries, etc., establish self-study groups, and regularize technical learning. Henan Province is preparing to organize 30,000 Michurin research groups in the next two years, which will gradually develop into forestry technology night schools. The Communist Youth League organizations and forestry departments of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Henan Province will also compile and print the experience of local people in planting trees and afforestation into books and vigorously promote it.
