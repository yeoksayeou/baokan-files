Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 18th. Chinese students who studied in the United States, Xu Feixi, Xu Riguang, Chen Yuqing and others, accused the U.S. government of long-term persecution and difficulties when they passed through Hong Kong on their way back to China on the 17th.

Xu Feixi, a Ph.D. in psychology who had studied in the United States for 18 years, told reporters: "My excitement now is conceivable. This is the first time in 18 years that I have gained freedom. There is no freedom of action in the United States, nor is there freedom of belief."

Xu Feixi said: "In 1948, I was used as a guinea pig at the Catholic University of America. I contracted an infectious disease, had a high fever, and spoke incoherently. They accused me of having a mental illness and sent me to a mental hospital. In fact, apart from the fever, my mind was still very normal at the time. In the hospital, they tortured me in various ways. Their purpose was to prevent me from returning to China. When those doctors talked to me, as soon as they heard that I wanted to return to China, they would say that my mental illness was too serious and I could not be discharged. I was locked up for eight months before being released."

Xu Feixi said that he later applied to return to China in 1953, and the procedures were completed. He thought that this time he would be able to fulfill his wish smoothly, but when he was about to leave, the US court found an excuse based on his family remaining in the United States and wanted to sue him, so he had to stay in the United States until this year, when the court told him that the "criminal case" was over and he could return to the country.

Xu Feixi told reporters that he had seen a blacklist of Chinese students compiled in the Immigration Bureau. The speeches of the students on the blacklist at public gatherings were recorded. Once when he went to the Immigration Bureau, an official flipped through such a list in front of him and said, "Let me see what activities you have participated in."

Xu Riguang and his wife Chen Yuqing are both medical experts. Xu Riguang told reporters that they applied to return to China in January 1951, and it was not until April 1954 that they received a notification letter from the U.S. Immigration Bureau. When they filled out the form to leave the country, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service came to make trouble again. It insisted that Xu Riguang and his wife had not reported the income tax exemption for their three children, so they owed the Internal Revenue Service more than 800 yuan in taxes. Because they were said to have outstanding tax issues, they could not leave the country. After waiting for more than a year, on January 15th of this year, the Internal Revenue Service wrote to Xu Riguang saying that his income tax matters had been completely clarified.

Xu Riguang also said: "For ten years, we have lived in the United States under constant mental threat. In 1951 alone, the FBI and the Immigration Bureau sent people to our home or summoned us for questioning eight or nine times. Each questioning lasted at least four or five hours, sometimes from eight o'clock in the morning to five or six o'clock in the afternoon. This is simply an illegal form of mental and physical abuse."

    我国留美学生徐飞锡等向香港记者控诉美当局的迫害
    新华社香港18日电　中国留美学生徐飞锡、徐日光、陈玉清等人17日从美国回国途中经过香港的时候，对香港记者控诉他们遭受美国政府长期迫害和留难的情况。
    徐飞锡是留美达18年的心理学博士。他对记者说：“我现在的兴奋是可想而知的，我是18年来第一次得到了自由。在美国行动没有自由，信仰也没有自由。”
    徐飞锡说：“1948年，我在美国公教大学就曾被他们作为荷兰猪（试验牺牲品）。我得了传染病，发高热，讲艺语。他们就指我有精神病，送我入精神病院。其实，我除了发热，那时的精神还是很正常的，在病院里他们用种种方法折磨我。他们的目的是：想阻挠我回国。那些医生们和我谈话，一听见我说想回国就说我精神病太重了，不能出院。我被关了8个月才被放出来。”
    徐飞锡说他后来在1953年申请回国，手续也办好了，以为这次能顺利如愿，可是临走的时候却被美国法院以他留在美国的家人为题找出借口，要控告他，结果又只好留在美国，直到今年，法院才告诉他那件“刑事案”没有事了，他可以返国。
    徐飞锡告诉记者，他在移民局曾经见到编就了的中国留学生黑名单，黑名单上的学生在公开集会上的发言都被记录起来。有一次他到移民局的时候，有个职员就曾经当他的面翻一份这样的名单，一边说：“让我看看你参加过什么活动没有。”
    徐日光和他的夫人陈玉清都是医学专家。徐日光对记者说，他们从1951年1月就申请回国，直到1954年4月，他们才接到美国移民局的一封通知信，而当他们填好了要离境的那张表格的时候，美国直接税局又来找麻烦。它硬说徐日光夫妇没有报上三个孩子的所得税豁免额，因此，算下来他们欠了直接税局800多元税。被说成税款手尾未清，他们就不能离境了。一直等了一年多，到今年1月15日，直接税局才去信给徐日光说，他的所得税款项完全弄清了。
    徐日光又说：“十年来，我们在美国无一日不是在精神威胁下生活着。单在1951年，联邦调查局和移民局便先后派人来我家或把我们传去盘问了八、九次。每一次盘问至少有四、五个钟头，有时由早上八点钟起问到下午五、六点钟止，这简直就是一种非法的精神和肉体的虐待折磨。”
