Yunnan Province's more than 12 million mu of spring crops are growing very well. Wheat has generally begun to bud, and the early-sown crops are flowering and filling. The province's 2.5 million mu of broad beans are also generally bearing pods, and the early-sown crops are already on the market. Rapeseed, which flowered and bore pods last winter, is now ripe.

    云南省小春作物生长很好
    云南省1，200多万亩小春作物，生长的很好。小麦已普遍打苞，播种较早的已扬花?浆。全省的250万亩蚕豆也普遍结实，播种较早的已经上市。在去年冬天就开花结实的油菜籽，现在已经成熟。
