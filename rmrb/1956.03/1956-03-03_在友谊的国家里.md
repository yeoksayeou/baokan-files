    In the Country of Friendship
    Vikoslav Pirpici, Head of the Yugoslav Journalists Delegation to China
    Director of the Yugoslav News Agency
    At the invitation of the All-China Journalists Association, Yugoslav journalists are visiting China as guests for seven weeks. Our delegation is composed of nine representatives from major Yugoslav newspapers, radio stations, and news agencies. Throughout our visit to friendly China, we have been surrounded by sincere hospitality and comradely friendship. Every step of our journey has been met with love and care.
    Our itinerary has been rich, diverse, and interesting.
    It is difficult in this short article to list all the places we have visited, and even more difficult to discuss the many symposiums and meetings that have been held for us.
    We spent our time in many industrial and mining enterprises. We visited many large factories and saw many new industrial construction sites. In the factories and mines, we had friendly discussions with leaders, engineers, technicians, and workers, many of whom have already been awarded the glorious title of "Model Worker."
    Our itinerary also included visits to many agencies in Beijing and other places. Party and government leaders in various places introduced us to all aspects of life and development in New China, including the great achievements that have been made and new prospects and plans.
    During visits to many agricultural producers' cooperatives and advanced cooperatives, all aspects of the socialist transformation of agriculture in China have been fully answered.
    During our visit to China, we witnessed the climax of the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce in various places, and we are catching up with the period when this transformation process is appearing on a huge scale.
    Our gracious hosts organized meetings with some outstanding cultural workers and social activists, and also organized visits to some social welfare, scientific, and health care institutions.
    We also visited some places related to the heroic struggles of the Chinese people in modern times. In these historical sites and memorial halls, a lot of materials about the glorious struggles waged by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party have been accumulated. These exhibits and historical sites all presented us with a living image of the heroic cause of the Chinese people, without whom and their cause, the Chinese people would not have been able to achieve their freedom and independence.
    Our delegation also had the opportunity to understand many issues concerning China's internal and foreign policies, as well as the path of China's socialist construction.
    Here, I would like to emphasize a part of our itinerary that is of paramount significance to our delegation.
    Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai and other outstanding leaders, received our delegation and held talks for more than two hours. It is not difficult to imagine how significant this meeting, the enthusiastic reception, and the sincere conversation meant to us Yugoslav journalists!
    Chairman Liu Shaoqi also received us and held nearly three hours of friendly talks.
    These precious meetings allowed us to understand the path of China's socialist construction, the characteristics of development in socialism, and issues such as domestic and foreign policies from the most authoritative sources.
    During our visit to China, we traveled thousands of kilometers, from Beijing to Harbin, to Guangzhou. We went from this city to that city, from this factory to that rural area, and met with hundreds and thousands of people—workers, farmers, and intellectuals.
    It is difficult in a journalist's short article to list all the places we have visited, and it is impossible to fully write out the impressions of this great journey. This requires a lot of space and more time.
    But, in short, I just want to talk about one point here.
    We have seen the great achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong in the struggle to build socialism and eliminate backwardness and the painful historical heritage.
    These achievements are the victory of the heroic, labor-loving Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party.
    We are sincerely excited about these victories. Our hearts are filled with ardent wishes, and we wish you new and greater achievements in further development!

    在友谊的国家里
    南斯拉夫新闻工作者访华代表团团长
    南斯拉夫通讯社社长  维科斯拉夫·皮尔皮齐
    南斯拉夫记者应中国新闻工作者联谊会的邀请，来中国作客7个星期。我们这个代表团是由南斯拉夫各大报纸、电台、通讯社的9名代表组成的。在友好的中国访问期间，我们始终是被包围在衷心的好客盛情和同志友好的气氛中。我们旅行的每一步都受到热爱和关怀。
    我们的日程是丰富，多样而又有意思的。
    在这篇短小的文章中难于列举我们所访问的一切地方，也更难于谈出为我们举行的多次座谈和会见。
    我们在许多工矿企业中渡过了自己的时间。我们参观了许多巨大的工厂，也看到了许多新的工业建筑工地。在厂矿企业中，我们和领导人、工程师、技术员、工人们进行了友谊的座谈，其中有很多人已经获得了“劳动模范”的光荣称号。
    在我们的日程中也包括了访问许多在北京、在各地的机关。各地的党政领导人在座谈中向我们介绍了新中国各方面的生活和发展，介绍了既得的伟大成就和新的远景规划。
    在访问许多农业生产合作社、高级社当中，对中国的农业社会主义改造的各方面问题也都得到了圆满的答复。
    当我们在中国访问的期间，在各地我们都迎接了私营工商业社会主义改造的高潮，我们正赶上这个改造过程出现巨大规模的时期。
    我们好客的主人为我们组织了和某些杰出的文化工作者、社会活动家的会面，也组织我们访问了一些社会福利、科学、卫生保健机关。
    我们也参观了一些和中国人民近代英勇斗争有关的地方。在这些历史名胜、纪念馆中都积累了好多中国人民在共产党领导下进行过光荣斗争的材料。这些陈列品和名胜古迹在我们眼中都呈现了中国人民英雄事业的活的形象，假如没有这些人和他们的事业，中国人民是不能实现自己的自由和独立的。
    我们的代表团也曾有机会了解中国的内政和外交政策的许多问题，也了解了中国社会主义建设的道路。
    在这里，我想强调一下我们日程中对我们代表团有无上珍贵意义的一部分。
    中华人民共和国主席毛泽东同志，在周恩来总理和其他杰出领导人的陪同下接见了我们代表团，并进行了两个多小时的谈话。不难想像，这种会面，充满热情的接见和衷心的谈话，对我们南斯拉夫记者来讲是意味着多么重大的意义！
    刘少奇委员长也接见了我们，并进行了近三小时的友好谈话。
    这些珍贵的会见使我们从最权威方面了解了中国社会主义建设的道路、社会主义中发展的特点以及内外政策等问题。
    在中国访问期间我们走了几千公里，由北京到哈尔滨，到广州。我们由这个城市走到那一个城市，由这个厂矿走到那一个农村，和成千上百的人们——工人、农民、知识分子见了面。
    在一个记者的短小的文章中难于例举我们访问过的一切地方，也不能充分写出我们这次大旅行的观感。这需要很大的篇幅和更多的时间。
    但是，总之我在这里只想谈一点。
    我们看到了在中国共产党和毛泽东同志领导下，中国人民在建设社会主义、消灭落后和沉痛的历史遗产的斗争中所取得的伟大成就。
    这些成就是英勇的、热爱劳动的中国人民和中国共产党的胜利。
    我们衷心地为这些胜利而兴奋。我们在内心中是充满了热诚的愿望，祝你们在进一步发展中取得更新的、更伟大的成就！
