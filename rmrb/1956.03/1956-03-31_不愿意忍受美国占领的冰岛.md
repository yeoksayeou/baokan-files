Iceland's parliament passed a resolution on March 28th with a majority vote, demanding the withdrawal of American troops from Iceland. This resolution of the Icelandic parliament reflects the common aspiration of the Icelandic people.

Iceland is a large island in the North Atlantic. It is about one thousand kilometers east of the European continent. It has an area of 103,000 square kilometers, but a population of only 148,000. Iceland is full of ice, snow, and volcanoes. Resources are scarce, the climate is cold, and crops are not suitable for growth. Fisheries and animal husbandry are the main sources of income. However, Iceland's geographical location gives it important strategic significance. It is precisely this that makes the American imperialist elements, who are bent on dominating the world, have a strong interest in it.

Before World War II, Iceland was nominally independent. However, the King of Denmark was its head of state, and diplomacy was also controlled by Denmark. During World War II, American and British troops were stationed in Iceland, where they established naval and air bases. Later, the United States forced British troops to withdraw, and the United States achieved sole military control. In 1944, Iceland completely broke away from Denmark and became the "Republic of Iceland." After the war, the American troops stayed there and forced Iceland to accept an agreement on the continued stationing of American troops in Iceland and the use of its airport, as well as the Marshall Plan, which the United States used as a tool for economic aggression. In April 1949, Iceland was drawn into the North Atlantic Group, and on May 5, 1951, it signed a "Defense Agreement" with the United States, allowing American troops to be stationed in Iceland for a long time and to establish military bases. In this way, the United States placed Iceland under its control as a protectorate, and unscrupulously interfered in Iceland's internal affairs.

The constraints imposed on Iceland by the United States have caused serious damage to Iceland's national interests. The United States has occupied Iceland's largest Keflavik Airport and other strategic strongholds, turning Iceland into an "unsinkable aircraft carrier" for the United States in the North Atlantic. This poses a huge threat to Iceland's security. At the same time, there are as many as 5,000 American troops stationed in Iceland, and all the expenses of these occupiers are borne by Iceland. This means that every thirty Icelanders must support one American officer or soldier. This is obviously a heavy burden on Iceland's finances, and as a result, the people are forced to endure heavy taxes and deteriorating living conditions. American "occupiers" also enjoy extraterritorial rights, smuggling and evading taxes, and acting recklessly. An Icelandic youth organization once condemned the behavior of the American occupiers, "Our country is ruled by the American military... The American military tramples on the rights of the Icelandic people, destroys the culture of the Icelandic people... American soldiers treat the people of our small country with arrogance and unreasonableness..." Needless to say, this situation is intolerable to every Icelander with a sense of national self-esteem.

For many years, the Icelandic people have been fighting to expel the American occupiers and safeguard national independence. With the development of the entire international situation, this struggle of the Icelandic people has become more and more powerful. Standing at the forefront of this struggle is the Icelandic United Socialist Party, which issued a statement in 1951 denouncing the American military occupation of Iceland and calling on the Icelandic people to fight for independence and the withdrawal of American troops. Since then, people from all walks of life in Iceland have participated more and more extensively in the movement against the American occupation. In September 1954, forty public leaders launched a nationwide signature campaign for independence, with the number of signatures accounting for 25% of the total population. Later, the "Iceland Committee Against the Occupation of the Country" was established to unify the deployment of the independence movement. Dockworkers have held strikes several times, refusing to unload American munitions. Strikes often spread to various places and developed into a national movement. Recently, the Icelandic people's call for the withdrawal of American troops is so strong that it cannot but affect some bourgeois political leaders as well. This is why the Icelandic Parliament was able to pass such a major resolution recently.

### 不愿意忍受美国占领的冰岛

    不愿意忍受美国占领的冰岛
    冰岛议会三月二十八日以多数通过了决议，要求美国军队撤出冰岛。冰岛议会的这一项决议反映了冰岛人民的共同愿望。
    冰岛是北大西洋中的一个大岛。它的东部离欧洲大陆约一千公里。面积有十万零三千平方公里，但是人口却只有十四万八千余人。冰岛境内布满了冰雪、火山，资源稀少，气候寒冷，农作物不宜生长，渔业和畜牧业是主要的经济来源。但是冰岛的地理位置却使它具有重要的战略地位。而正是这一点，使得一心妄想称霸全球的美国帝国主义分子对它发生浓厚的兴趣。
    第二次大战前，冰岛名义上虽为独立。但是以丹麦国王为它的国家元首，外交也由丹麦控制。第二次世界大战期间，美英军队进驻冰岛，在那里建立了海空军基地。后来美国迫使英国军队撤离，就实现了美国单独的军事控制。1944年，冰岛完全脱离丹麦成为“冰岛共和国”。战后，美国军队赖在那里不走，并强使冰岛接受了关于美国军队继续驻扎冰岛并使用其机场的协定和美国利用作为经济侵略工具的马歇尔计划。1949年4月，冰岛又被拉进了北大西洋集团，并于1951年5月5日和美国签订了“防御协定”，允许美国军队长期驻扎冰岛和建立军事基地。这样美国就把冰岛当作一个被保护国一样置于它的控制之下，对冰岛的内政进行肆无忌惮的干涉。
    美国强加于冰岛的约束，对冰岛的民族利益造成了严重的损害，美国占用了冰岛最大的凯夫拉维克机场和其他的战略据点，把冰岛变成了美国在北大西洋的一艘“不沉的航空母舰”。这就使冰岛的安全受到巨大的威胁。同时，美国驻在冰岛的军队有五千人之多，这些占领者的一切费用，都由冰岛开支。这就是说每三十个冰岛人就要供应一名美国官兵。这对于冰岛的财政显然是一桩沉重的负担，结果人民就被迫忍受重税和日趋恶化的生活。美国“占领者”还享有治外法权，走私漏税，胡作非为。冰岛的一个青年组织曾经这样谴责过美国占领者的行为，“我们的国家被美军统治着，……美军蹂躏冰岛人民的权利、破坏冰岛人民的文化……美国兵用蛮横无理的态度对待我们小国人民。……”不用说，这种情况是每一个具有民族自尊感的冰岛人所不能容忍的。
    多年以来，冰岛人民一直就为驱逐美国占领者、维护民族独立而进行斗争。随着整个国际局势的发展，冰岛人民的这种斗争也越来越有力。站在这个斗争最前列的是冰岛统一社会党，它在1951年曾发表声明，痛斥美国军队占领冰岛，号召冰岛人民为争取独立和撤退美军而斗争。自那时以后，冰岛各阶层人民越来越广泛地参加反对美国占领的运动。1954年9月，四十名公众领袖在全国发起了要求独立的签名运动，签名人数占总人口的25％。以后又成立了“冰岛反对国土被占领委员会”统一部署独立运动。码头工人们曾经数度举行罢工，拒绝卸下美国军火。罢工每每蔓延各地，发展成为全国性的运动。最近，冰岛人民要求美军撤退的呼声是这样的强烈，以至它不能不对一些资产阶级的政治领袖也发生了影响。这就是冰岛议会最近所以能够通过这样一项重大决议的原故。
