Safeguarding the Peace and Security of Middle Eastern Countries

    Dulles' recent speech to the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Middle Eastern policy once again demonstrates the U.S. government's determination to disregard the sovereignty and interests of Middle Eastern countries and intensify its aggressive policy in the region.

    In his speech, Dulles emphatically repeated the statement in the joint communique of the Anglo-American Washington talks on February 1st, that the United States would take measures in the Middle East in accordance with the so-called Tripartite Declaration of 1950 to intensify interference in the affairs of Middle Eastern countries. Dulles' repeated mention of this infamous so-called Tripartite Declaration is to give the impression that the United States and other colonial countries have the right, under this declaration, to disregard the will of Middle Eastern countries and peoples and make decisions on their own affairs on their behalf. However, this is of no avail. This so-called Tripartite Declaration was created by the United States, Britain, and France behind the backs of the United Nations and without the participation of Middle Eastern countries. It is a clear sign of the colonial countries' arbitrary control over the affairs of the Middle Eastern region. Now, Dulles, using this declaration as a "basis," abruptly announces that actions will be taken in the Middle East outside the scope of the United Nations. This is fundamentally incompatible with the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter and is a further blatant interference in the affairs of Middle Eastern countries.

    Over the past five years, major changes have taken place in the Middle East. Some Arab countries have freed themselves from colonialist enslavement and are embarking on the path of independent development and national rejuvenation; the people of other countries are waging a heroic and unyielding struggle for national independence. The colonial countries' enslavement rule in the Middle East, especially over the Arab countries, is obviously becoming increasingly precarious. Dulles is now dusting off this so-called Tripartite Declaration, attempting to impose it on the people of the Middle Eastern countries. It is evident that this is because the United States is still trying to obliterate the significantly changed situation in the Middle East, prevent the Middle Eastern countries from deciding their own problems, and save the colonialist enslavement rule in the Middle East. This approach by the United States will only further deepen the tensions in the Middle East, posing a greater threat to peace and security there.

    In recent years, the tension and unrest in the Middle East have been entirely caused by the aggressive policies of the United States and other colonial countries, which have sought to create military blocs and divide the Arab countries. The United States' plans to establish the so-called "Middle East Command" and the so-called "Middle East Defense Organization" have been foiled one after another due to the opposition of the Arab countries. Therefore, it has openly adopted a policy of dividing the Arab countries and using military alliances to exert pressure on independent Arab countries along with Britain. The establishment of the Turkish-Iraqi military alliance has strained relations between Iraq and other Arab countries. The establishment of the Baghdad Pact has further expanded the division among Middle Eastern countries. The attempt by the United States and Britain to force Jordan to join the Baghdad Pact has aroused resolute resistance and bloody conflicts among the Jordanian people. The United States has also used the Egyptian-Israeli border disputes, the Jordan River water disputes, and the issue of 900,000 refugees to keep the Middle Eastern countries in a state of long-term opposition and tension. No sophistry of Dulles can cover this up.

    In his speech, Dulles slandered the arms trade between Arab countries and Czechoslovakia as provoking a so-called "arms race," while portraying the United States as being against the "arms race" and the "use of force or threat of force" between Middle Eastern countries. Dulles' lie will not find much of a market. The purchase of arms by Arab countries from Czechoslovakia is the sovereignty of these countries and brooks no interference from other countries; and this is a normal international trade between sovereign states, which has never and will never provoke any arms race. It is not others, but the United States itself, that has provoked the arms race and used force or the threat of force. The 1950 Tripartite Declaration openly declared that it would supply Middle Eastern countries with "weapons and war materials" and forcibly stipulated that these weapons and materials should be used to "participate in the defense of the entire region," that is, for the work of the Middle East aggression bloc that the United States was trying to organize. This is truly provoking an arms race and using force and the threat of force in the region. Here, the colonial countries, led by the United States, want to use force to control the entire Middle East and turn it into an instrument of aggression for the colonial countries. Understandably, this attempt by the United States has been met with strong opposition from many Arab countries and has failed. But the United States is not reconciled to this. For several years, it has exerted pressure on the Arab countries from political, economic, and military aspects, including provoking conflicts between Arab countries and Israel. Is this not precisely provoking an arms race and using force or the threat of force? Not only that, but many facts show that the United States is also preparing to directly use force or the threat of force against Middle Eastern countries. After the Anglo-American Washington talks, the U.S. news agencies have continuously revealed that the United States will send troops to the Middle East to adopt a so-called "deterrence policy" against Middle Eastern countries. This is obviously aimed at the Arab countries that resolutely maintain independence and autonomy.

    This increasingly blatant aggressive activity by the United States seriously threatens the peace and independence and sovereignty of Middle Eastern countries, arousing the legitimate concern of all peace-loving countries and peoples. The Soviet Foreign Ministry issued a statement on February 13 regarding the Anglo-American measures in the Middle East, correctly reflecting the common desire of the peace-loving people of the world and the people of all Middle Eastern countries to safeguard the peace and independence of Middle Eastern countries.

    The Soviet statement pointed out: "Actions to send troops to the territory of Middle Eastern countries without the consent of the countries concerned and without the permission of the United Nations Security Council, which has primary responsibility for maintaining peace, would be a serious violation of the United Nations Charter and an infringement of the national sovereignty of these countries." The Soviet Union stated in the statement that it would work with other relevant countries to consolidate the security of the Middle East. The Soviet government's selfless and peace-maintaining stance in international affairs will not only have a major impact on maintaining international peace and the dignity of the United Nations, but also provide strong support for the struggle of Middle Eastern countries and peoples to safeguard their own independence and sovereignty.

    This statement by the Soviet government has been warmly supported by the Arab countries and the people of the world. Syrian newspapers believe that this is a manifestation of the Soviet Union's defense of the independence and freedom of the people of Middle Eastern countries. The Chinese people fully support the just position taken by the Soviet government and people on Middle Eastern affairs. At the same time, the Chinese people deeply sympathize with the struggle of the Arab countries and the people of the Middle East for national independence. We are willing to work with the Soviet Union and all countries concerned with maintaining peace in the Middle East to consolidate the peace, independence, and security of the Middle Eastern countries.

    The development of the strength of the people of the Middle Eastern countries to maintain peace and national independence is absolutely unstoppable by the United States and other aggressive forces. As the Egyptian "Al-Akhbar" said: "The future of the Arab countries is neither decided by London nor by Washington, but by the people of the Arab countries themselves. The Arab countries will never allow foreign interference in their affairs." Although Dulles and his ilk are still stepping up their plans for aggression against the Middle Eastern countries today, they cannot scare the people of this region, nor can they save the doomed and complete failure of colonialism.

### 维护中近东国家的和平和安全

    维护中近东国家的和平和安全
    杜勒斯最近向美国参议院外交委员会发表对中近东政策的谈话，再一次地表明美国政府决心不顾中近东国家的主权和利益，要加紧在这个地区推行它的侵略政策。
    杜勒斯在这个谈话中强调地重复了2月1日英美华盛顿会谈联合声明中的说法，就是美国要按照所谓1950年的三国宣言在中近东采取措施，来加紧干涉中近东国家的事务。杜勒斯重复提出这个臭名昭著的所谓三国宣言，是要给人一种印象，好像美国和其他殖民国家根据这个宣言，就有权不顾中近东国家和人民的意志，代替他们对他们自己的事务作出决定。但是，这完全无济于事。这个所谓三国宣言是美国、英国和法国背着联合国并且在没有中近东国家参加的情况下制造出来的。它是殖民国家武断支配中近东地区的事务的鲜明标志。现在，杜勒斯以这个宣言为“根据”，断然宣布要在联合国范围以外对中近东地区采取行动，这是同联合国宪章的原则和宗旨根本不相容的，也是对中近东各国事务进一步的横暴干涉。
    5年多来，中近东地区的情况发生了重大的变化。有些阿拉伯国家从殖民主义奴役下摆脱出来，正在走上独立发展和民族复兴的道路；另外一些国家的人民正在为争取民族独立而进行着英勇不屈的斗争。殖民国家在中近东，特别是对阿拉伯国家的奴役统治，显然是越来越摇摇欲坠了。杜勒斯现在重新搬出这个所谓三国宣言，企图把它强加在中近东国家人民的头上。显而易见，这是因为美国仍然企图抹煞中近东这种已经发生了重大变化的形势，阻止中近东各国自己决定自己的问题，以挽救殖民主义在中近东的奴役统治。美国的这种作法，只会使中近东地区紧张局势进一步加深，使那里的和平和安全受到更大的威胁。
    这些年来，中近东地区局势的紧张不安完全是美国和其他殖民国家力图在那里制造军事集团、分裂阿拉伯国家的侵略政策所引起的。美国建立所谓“中东司令部”和所谓“中东防御集团”的计划由于阿拉伯国家的反对而先后遭受失败，因此它就同英国一道，公开采取了分裂阿拉伯国家并且用组织军事同盟来对独立自主的阿拉伯国家施加压力的方针。土伊军事联盟的建立，就使伊拉克和其他阿拉伯国家之间的关系紧张起来。巴格达条约的建立，更扩大了中近东国家之间的分裂。美英企图强迫约旦加入巴格达条约的结果，引起了约旦人民的坚决反抗和流血冲突。美国更利用以埃边境纠纷、约旦河水利纠纷和90万难民的问题，使中近东国家长期处在对立的紧张状态。这是杜勒斯的任何遁词都无法掩盖的。
    杜勒斯在谈话中污蔑阿拉伯国家和捷克斯洛伐克进行的军火贸易是挑起了所谓“军备竞赛”，而把美国说成是反对中近东国家之间进行“军备竞赛”和“使用武力或武力的威胁”。杜勒斯的这个谎言是不会有什么市场的。阿拉伯国家向捷克斯洛伐克购买军火，是这些国家的主权，不容别国干涉；而且这是主权国家之间的正常的国际贸易，从来没有也决不会挑起什么军备竞赛。挑起军备竞赛和使用武力或武力的威胁的，不是别人，恰恰是美国自己。1950年三国宣言公然宣称要以“武器和战争物资”供应中近东国家，并且强行规定这些武器和物资要用于“参加整个地区的防御工作”，也就是用于美国图谋组织的中东侵略集团的工作。这才真正是在这个地区挑起军备竞赛并且使用武力和武力的威胁。在这里，以美国为首的殖民国家就是想用武力控制整个中东地区，并且把它变成殖民国家的侵略工具。理所当然，美国的这种图谋遭到许多阿拉伯国家正义的强烈反对而归于失败。但是美国并不就此甘心。几年来它就从政治、经济、军事各方面对阿拉伯国家施加压力，包括挑起阿拉伯国家和以色列之间的冲突在内。这难道不正是挑起军备竞赛和使用武力或武力的威胁吗？不仅这样，有许多事实说明，美国还正准备要对中近东国家直接使用武力或武力的威胁。在美英华盛顿会谈以后，美国通讯社就不断透露，美国将派遣军队到中近东地区去，要对中近东国家采取所谓“威慑政策”。这显然是针对坚决维护独立自主的阿拉伯国家的。
    美国这种日益露骨的侵略活动，严重地威胁着中近东国家的和平和独立主权，引起了一切爱好和平的国家和人民的正当关切。苏联外交部于2月13日发表关于英美在中近东的措施的声明，正确地反映了世界爱好和平人民和中近东各国人民对于维护中近东国家和平和独立的共同愿望。
    苏联的声明中指出：“没有得到有关国家的同意以及没有得到对维持和平负有主要责任的机构联合国安全理事会的许可而把军队派到中近东国家领土上去的行动，将是严重违反联合国宪章以及侵犯这些国家的国家主权的行动。”苏联在声明中并表示，它将同其他有关国家一起来努力使中近东地区的安全获得巩固。苏联政府在国际事务上这种大公无私的维护和平的立场，不仅对于维护国际和平和联合国尊严将产生重大影响，它对于中近东国家和人民维护自己的独立主权的斗争，也是有力的支持。
    苏联政府这个声明，得到了阿拉伯国家和世界各国人民的热烈拥护。叙利亚报纸认为，这是苏联保卫中近东国家人民独立自由的表现。中国人民完全支持苏联政府和人民在中近东事务上所采取的正义立场。同时，中国人民深深地同情阿拉伯国家和中近东各国人民争取民族独立的斗争。我们愿同苏联以及一切关心维持中近东地区和平的国家共同努力，以巩固中近东各国的和平、独立和安全。
    中近东国家人民维护和平和民族独立的力量的发展，是美国和其他侵略势力绝对阻止不住的。正如埃及“消息报”所说的：“阿拉伯各国的前途既不由伦敦决定，也不由华盛顿决定，它是由阿拉伯各国人民自己来决定。阿拉伯国家决不允许外国干涉它们的事务。”尽管杜勒斯之流今天还在加紧策划对中近东国家的侵略，但是他们既吓不倒这个地区的人民，也挽救不了殖民主义注定彻底失败的命运。
