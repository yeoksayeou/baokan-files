Hunan Peasants' Production Increase Competition

More than 80,000 agricultural production cooperatives in Hunan Province are carrying out the "Increase Production and Love the Cooperative" movement. Many agricultural cooperatives have established "Love the Cooperative Day," "Merit Books," or "Honor Rolls" during this movement. In order to strive for meritorious service in socialist construction, cooperative members have launched labor competitions comparing quality, work efficiency, and attendance rate.

The "Increase Production and Love the Cooperative" labor competition in more than 300 cooperatives in Yuanjiang County, on the shores of Dongting Lake, has entered a climax, starting spring plowing ten days earlier than in previous years.

The Lianmeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ningxiang County celebrated its first "Love the Cooperative Day" on March 15th. On this day, more than 30 members of the Second Team of the Eighth Production Brigade went to the fields to plow and deliver fertilizer at daybreak. On this day, the number of workers in the entire cooperative increased by more than 300 compared to normal, labor efficiency increased by 25%, and each of the 921 cooperative members did one or two beneficial things for the cooperative.

    湖南农民的增产竞赛
    湖南省八万多个农业生产合作社正在开展“增产爱社”运动。许多农业社在这个运动中建立了“爱社日”、“立功簿”或“光荣榜”。社员们为了争取在社会主义建设中立功，都纷纷开展比质量、比工效、比出勤率的劳动竞赛。
    洞庭湖滨的沅江县三百多个社的“增产爱社”的劳动竞赛，已经进入高潮，比往年提早十天开始春耕。
    宁乡县联盟农业生产合作社，在三月十五日度过了第一个“爱社日”。这一天，第八生产大队二小队的三十多个社员，天刚亮就到田里忙着犁田、送肥。这一天，全社出工人数比平常增加三百多个，劳动效率提高了25％，921个社员每人各为社里做了一件或两件有益的事。（据新华社讯）
