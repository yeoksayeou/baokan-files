Reclaiming wasteland and developing agriculture is receiving increasing attention from Party and government leading organs at all levels and the broad masses of people, along with the rapid development of the country's socialist construction. In the past year or two, most provinces and regions have conducted planned surveys and exploration of wasteland. In the past three years, nearly 30 million mu of wasteland have been reclaimed nationwide. Since the beginning of spring this year, provinces and cities such as Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai have mobilized large numbers of immigrants to reclaim wasteland in provinces and regions such as Heilongjiang, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, and Jiangxi. Other provinces are also actively carrying out intra-provincial immigration and reclamation work. Young people are playing a exemplary leading role in immigration and reclamation. Many youth volunteer reclamation teams have come from the interior to the border areas, using their own hands to start reclaiming new land and building new villages and cities in desolate places. Their high enthusiasm for building socialism has been praised by the people of the whole country.

Reclaiming wasteland is a long-term plan for developing agricultural production. China currently has more than 1.64 billion mu of cultivated land, averaging less than 3 mu per person based on a national population of 600 million. This is a weakness of China's current agricultural economy. To overcome this weakness, in addition to striving to increase the yield per unit area of existing cultivated land, it is also necessary to reclaim a large amount of wasteland. China has about 1.5 billion mu of wasteland. According to existing data estimates, about 500 million mu of wasteland can be reclaimed in the initial stage. Large areas of wasteland are mostly in the Northeast, Northwest, Southwest, and some coastal areas. Much of the wasteland has fertile soil and sufficient water sources. If this wasteland is reclaimed during several five-year plans, and if each mu produces 300 jin of grain per year, more than 100 billion jin can be produced annually, which is a very large amount.

Reclaiming wasteland has not only significant economic significance but also significant political significance. China's Northwest region and various border provinces have sparse populations, and their economies and cultures are relatively backward. Through planned immigration and reclamation, these areas will prosper, the economic and cultural undertakings of all regions of the country will develop in a balanced way, and the phenomenon of uneven development among various ethnic minorities will be rapidly eliminated.

Under the current circumstances in China, wasteland can be reclaimed in the following ways: one is for the state to establish state-owned farms for large-scale reclamation; one is for the state to use machinery to reclaim wasteland and then immigrate people to cultivate it; one is for agricultural production cooperatives to establish production teams or organize branches for short-distance immigration and reclamation; and one is for farmers to reclaim small plots of wasteland nearby. Of these four methods, except for the first one, which is entirely the responsibility of the state, the other three methods mainly rely on the manpower and material resources of the masses. China has a large population and abundant labor force. In provinces with dense populations and less cultivated land, the masses have long had the demand to expand cultivated land. Provinces such as Shandong and Henan have always had the habit of immigration and reclamation. As long as Party and government leading organs at all levels rely well on the organized strength of agricultural cooperation, adapt to the demands of the broad masses, and earnestly strengthen leadership over this work, mass wasteland reclamation work will not be difficult to carry out smoothly.

Organizing the masses to reclaim small plots of wasteland nearby is simple, easy to implement, and yields the fastest results. It is estimated that farmers across the country can reclaim about 100 million mu of small plots of wasteland on the spot. These wastelands include hills,滩地, sandy land, alkaline land, and scattered wastelands next to houses and roads. Some of these wastelands are too fragmented, and individual farmers cannot obtain significant benefits from scattered reclamation; some are too large in area, and individual farmers do not have the strength to reclaim them. Now, mobilizing agricultural cooperatives to collectively reclaim these wastelands can quickly obtain benefits. Chifeng County in the former Rehe Province organized farmers to reclaim wasteland nearby last year, reclaiming more than 87,000 mu in one spring, which is a clear example. The reclamation of these wastelands must be combined with water and soil conservation work to strictly prevent the phenomenon of "reclaiming wasteland and destroying good farmland."

Immigrating to reclaim large areas of wasteland, especially long-distance immigration and reclamation, is a more complicated issue and requires more work. Generally, people have the psychology and habit of "reluctance to leave their homeland." This requires in-depth publicity and mobilization of immigrants, so that they fully understand that reclaiming wasteland and building new villages and cities in sparsely populated areas is indeed a difficult and arduous task; precisely because of this, it is a glorious and great task. If everyone is afraid of difficulties and hardships, how can a socialist society be built successfully? As the founder of a new village and a new city, building a happy life for future generations is not the most proud thing? In mobilizing immigrants, special attention should be paid to the work of young people. Young people are shock forces on all production fronts, and where energetic young people are mobilized, difficulties are easily overcome. The Soviet Union fully mobilized and utilized the shock force of young people in the large-scale land reclamation work that began in 1953, which is known to everyone. China's youth have excellent revolutionary traditions, and they have already set a brilliant example in the immigration work that has begun not long ago. People expect them to learn from the youth of the Soviet Union and take on even greater land reclamation tasks.

In order to do a good job in expeditionary reclamation, it is necessary not only to help the masses solve various ideological problems, but also to help them solve many practical problems. Such as the disposal of property or the resettlement of family members when immigrants move out, travel life, and life and production after arriving at the destination. The handling of these issues, of course, depends on the immigrants to give play to the spirit of fraternity and mutual assistance, and save manpower and material resources for the country as much as possible, but this must not in the slightest reduce the responsibility of the relevant agencies to help immigrants deal with these problems. The transportation department should do a good job in transporting immigrants to ensure the safety and convenience of immigrants during their journey; the state bank should allocate funds and loans in a timely manner; the grain department should supply immigrants' rations in a timely manner; the supply and marketing cooperative should do a good job in supplying materials; the health department should do a good job in the health and medical care of immigrants; and the Party and government leading organs in various regions where immigrants move out and move in should do a good job in sending off and resettling immigrants. We must help immigrants in all aspects, care for immigrants with the greatest enthusiasm, and reduce their difficulties and inconveniences as much as possible, so that they feel that there is a warm home everywhere; so that they can settle down and devote themselves to production soon after arriving at their destination, and establish a happy life in three or five years. In last year's immigration work, most places handled the specific problems of immigrants very well and accumulated a lot of experience. Of course, there are still many areas that lack experience in immigration work. They should learn from areas that have experience and make full preparations in advance so that all problems can be properly resolved.

Reclaiming wasteland is a complex task involving agriculture, forestry, water conservancy and other departments. Party and government leading organs in various places should work with relevant departments to make overall plans. According to the possible conditions of manpower and material resources, lead the masses to carry out step by step in a planned and organized manner, and strictly prevent the occurrence of water and soil damage due to blind land reclamation.

### 开垦荒地

    开垦荒地
    随着国家社会主义建设事业的迅速发展，开垦荒地、发展农业的问题，越来越引起各级党政领导机关和广大人民的重视。近一两年以来，多数省区都有计划地进行了荒地的调查和勘测。在过去三年中，全国开垦的荒地近3，000万亩。今年入春以来，河南、山东、河北、北京、天津、上海等省、市，动员大批移民到黑龙江、青海、新疆、内蒙古、甘肃、江西等省区开荒。其他省份也在积极进行省内移民开荒的工作。青年人在移民开荒当中发挥了模范带头作用。许多青年志愿垦荒队从内地到边疆，用自己的双手，开始在荒凉的地方开垦新地，建设新的村庄和城市。他们这种高度的建设社会主义的热情，受到全国人民的赞扬。
    开垦荒地是发展农业生产的百年大计。我国现有耕地164，000多万亩，按全国6亿人口平均，每人不到3亩。这是当前我国农业经济的弱点。要克服这个弱点，除了努力提高现有耕地的单位面积产量以外，还要大量开垦荒地。我国的荒地约有15亿亩左右。据现有资料估计，可以先期开垦的荒地约5亿多亩。大片荒地多在东北、西北、西南和某些沿海地区。许多荒地土质肥沃，水源充足。如果在几个五年计划期间，把这些荒地都开垦出来，假使每年每亩生产粮食300斤，每年可以生产一千多亿斤，这是很大的数目。
    开垦荒地不但有重大的经济意义，而且有重大的政治意义。我国西北地区和各个边疆省份，人口稀少，经济、文化都比较落后。经过有计划地移民开垦，这些地区就会繁荣起来，国家各个地区的经济、文化事业就会平衡发展，各个少数民族发展不平衡的现象就会迅速消除。
    在我国目前的情况下开垦荒地，可以通过这样几种方式：一种是由国家建立国营农场，进行大规模的开垦；一种是国家用机器开荒，然后移民耕种；一种是由农业生产合作社建立生产队或组织分社，进行近距离的移民开垦；一种是由农民就近开垦小片荒地。这四种方式，除了第一种完全由国家负责以外，其余三种方式，主要依靠群众的人力物力。我国人口众多，劳力充裕，在人口稠密耕地较少的省份，群众早有扩大耕地的要求。山东、河南等省，历来有移民垦荒的习惯。各级党政领导机关只要很好地依靠有组织的农业合作化的力量，适应广大群众的要求，认真加强对这个工作的领导，群众性的开荒工作就不难顺利开展起来。
    组织群众就近开垦小片荒地，简单易行，收效最快。据估计，全国各地可由农民就地开垦的小片荒地约有一亿亩。这些荒地包括丘陵、滩地、沙地、碱地和宅旁、路边的零星荒地。这些荒地有的过于零碎，个体农民零星开垦，不能获得显著的效益；有的因为面积较大，个体农民没有开垦的力量。现在发动农业合作社集体开垦这些荒地，就能迅速获得收益。原热河省赤峰县去年组织农民就近开荒，一个春季开垦87，000多亩，就是一个显明的例子。开垦这些荒地必须和水土保持工作相结合，严防“开了荒地、毁了良田”的现象。
    移民开垦大片荒地，特别是远距离移民开荒，问题比较复杂，要作更多的工作。一般人都有“故土难离”的心理和习惯。这就需要对移民进行深入的宣传动员，使他们完全懂得：在人烟稀少的地区开垦荒地，建立新的乡村和城市，诚然是艰苦困难的工作；正因为这样，所以它是光荣伟大的工作。如果大家都怕艰难困苦，社会主义社会怎么能建设成功呢？自己作为一个新乡村、新城市的创建者，给后世儿孙建设幸福生活，这难道不是最值得骄傲的事情吗？在动员移民当中，要特别注意作好青年的工作。青年是各个生产战线上的突击手，那里把朝气勃勃的青年发动起来，那里的困难就容易克服。苏联在1953年开始的大规模垦荒工作中，充分发动和运用了青年的突击力量，这是大家都知道的。我国的青年有优良的革命传统，在开始不久的移民工作中，他们已经作出了光辉的榜样。人们都期望他们能向苏联的青年学习，把更大的开荒任务担负起来。
    为了做好远征开垦的工作，不仅要帮助群众解决各种思想问题，更要帮助他们解决许多实际问题。如移民迁出时候的财产处理或家属安置，旅途生活，到达目的地以后的生活、生产等问题。这些问题的处理，固然要依靠移民发挥友爱互助的精神，尽量为国家节省人力物力，但这决不能丝毫减轻有关机关帮助移民处理这些问题的责任。交通部门要做好运送移民的工作，保证移民旅途安全方便；国家银行要及时拨款和贷款；粮食部门要及时供应移民的口粮；供销合作部门要做好物资供应工作；卫生部门要作好移民的卫生医疗工作；各个有移民迁出、移入的地区的党政领导机关，要做好移民的遣送和安置工作。我们要从各个方面来帮助移民，用最大的热情来关心移民，尽可能减少他们的困难和不便，使他们感到到处都是温暖的家；让他们到达目的地以后，很快就能够安心地投入生产，三、五年后，就能建立起幸福的生活。在去年的移民工作中，多数地方对移民的具体问题处理得都很好，也积累了许多经验。当然还有许多地区对移民工作缺乏经验，他们应当向已有经验的地区学习，事先做好充分准备，使各种问题都得到妥善解决。
    开垦荒地是牵涉到农、林、水利等部门的复杂工作。各地党政领导机关，要会同各有关部门，做好全面规划。根据人力物力的可能条件，有计划、有组织地领导群众逐步进行，严格防止因为盲目开荒而破坏水土的现象发生。
