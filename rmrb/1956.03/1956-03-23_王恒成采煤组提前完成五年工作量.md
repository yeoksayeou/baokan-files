    Wang Hengcheng Coal Mining Team Completes Five-Year Workload Ahead of Schedule
    The Wang Hengcheng coal mining team of Benxi Coal Mine completed the workload for the first Five-Year Plan period ahead of schedule on March 14th. The Wang Hengcheng coal mining team learned and created 15 advanced experiences such as pneumatic pickaxe-based beam notch excavation and lower stringer beams, which greatly improved coal mining efficiency. After learning the experience of the Fushun Longfeng Mine coal mining work team this March, they can complete two days of coal mining quota in one day. This team also pays great attention to conservation. In the past three years, the team has saved the country pit props and recovered "bottom coal" worth 244 taels of gold in total. Now, all the workers of the Wang Hengcheng team have proposed to complete the 1958 workload ahead of schedule on National Day this year.

    王恒成采煤组提前完成五年工作量
    本溪煤矿王恒成采煤小组在三月十四日提前完成了第一个五年计划期间的工作量。王恒成采煤小组学习和创造了风镐掏梁窝、下串梁子等十五种先进经验，大大提高了采煤效率。今年三月他们学习抚顺龙凤矿采煤工作队的经验以后，一天能完成两天的采煤定额。这个小组也很注意节约。三年多来，全组为国家节省的坑木和回收的“底煤”，共值黄金244两。现在，王恒成小组的全体工人又提出要在今年国庆节提前完成1958年的工作量。
