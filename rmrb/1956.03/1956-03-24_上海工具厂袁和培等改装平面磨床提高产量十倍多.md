Yuan Hepei, head of the construction team at the Third Product Workshop of the state-owned Shanghai Tool Factory, and young technicians Wu Shanchang and others (a team of four people) modified the original surface of the grinder, which had no angle, to have a slope suitable for grinding blades. This increased the number of indexable end mill cutter blades that could be ground at one time from two to twenty-six. At the same time, they designed a special magnetic chuck to hold the blades firmly on the surface of the grinder to ensure quality. After the workers officially used this grinder for production on the 12th, the output of blades increased more than tenfold compared to the past, and the quality fully met the standards.

    上海工具厂袁和培等改装平面磨床提高产量十倍多
    国营上海工具厂第三产品车间施工组组长袁和培和青年技术员巫善昌等四人，把原来没有斜度的磨床平面，改装成有适合于磨刀片的斜度，使磨镶片边铣刀刀片由过去一次只能磨两片提高到磨二十六片。同时他们又设计了一个特殊的吸铁盘，把放在磨床面上磨的刀片吸牢，以保证质量。工人们在十二日正式使用这台磨床进行生产后，刀片的产量就比往日增加十倍多，质量也完全合乎标准。
