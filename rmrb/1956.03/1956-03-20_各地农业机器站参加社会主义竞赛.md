Agricultural machinery and tractor stations in Beijing, Changzhi, Shenyang, and Huachuan initiated a socialist emulation drive, which continues to receive responses from agricultural machinery stations across the country. Recently, six stations in Shandong Province, namely Linqing, Dexian, Guangrao, Kunyu, Jiaoxian, and Licheng, as well as two stations in Henan Province, Xinxiang and Xihua, and 24 model tractor and farm implement operators throughout the province, have successively responded to the "Improve Operation Quality, Save Funds, and Guarantee Increased Production" socialist emulation drive initiated by the four stations in Beijing, and have respectively launched labor emulation drives between stations or between workers of the same type within the province.

Agricultural machinery stations participating in the emulation drive in various regions have formulated plans to fully utilize the effectiveness of machinery, expand the area of contract farming, and help the agricultural cooperatives they serve to create large-scale high yields. This year, the contract farming area of the seventeen stations in Shanxi Province will be expanded to 1.26 million mu. Among them, the average yield of 840,000 mu of cotton fields should reach 336 jin of seed cotton per mu, an increase of 93% compared to last year's yield; the average yield of 420,000 mu of food crops such as wheat and corn should reach 245 jin to 560 jin per mu, an increase of more than 50% compared to last year. The six stations in Shandong Province require all tractors to achieve 800 hours of safe operation this year, and each station also requires one to several tractors to create a record of 1,800 hours of safe operation. The cultivated area per standard tractor in each station will be increased by two or three times compared to last year. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    各地农业机器站参加社会主义竞赛
    北京、长治、沈阳、桦川四个农业机器拖拉机站倡议的社会主义竞赛，继续得到各地农业机器站的响应。最近以来，山东省的临清、德县、广饶、昆嵛、胶县、历城等六个站，河南省的新乡、西华两站和全省24个模范拖拉机手、农具手，都先后响应了北京等四个站倡议的“提高作业质量，节约资金，保证增产”的社会主义竞赛，并且分别在全省范围内发起了站和站间或同工种间的劳动竞赛。
    各地参加竞赛的农业机器站，都订出了充分发挥机具效能，扩大代耕面积，帮助所服务的农业社创造大面积丰产等计划。山西省十七个站的代耕面积，今年将扩大到126万亩。其中84万亩棉田平均每亩要产籽棉336斤，比去年产量提高93％；42万亩小麦、玉米等粮食作物平均每亩产245斤到560斤，比去年提高50％以上，山东省六个站要求今年所有拖拉机达作八百小时的安全作业，各站并且要求有一台到几台拖拉机创造安全作业1，800小时的纪录。各站每标准台拖拉机的耕地面积，将比去年分别提高两倍或三倍。　（据新华社讯）
