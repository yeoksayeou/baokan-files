    Let's Give it a Try
    The Baotou Municipal Bureau of Industry recently held two tests. The participants were factory directors, engineers, section chiefs, workshop directors, work team leaders, and trade union staff from enterprises under the bureau's jurisdiction. The test questions were all about the basic conditions of each factory, such as: What products does the factory have? How many workshops, work teams, and groups are there? Who are the responsible persons? What is the task for the first quarter of 1956? How much was completed in January? What is the task for February? What measures are being taken to complete the February plan, etc.?
    However, the test results were startling. First test: among the 109 participants, as many as 95 failed, accounting for 87% of the total, of which 35 got zero marks. Among the 10 factory directors and 8 trade union chairmen, only one each passed. The second test result was better than the first, but the failure rate was still above 47%.
    The two test results are like a merciless mirror, reflecting the serious shortcomings of the responsible personnel of each factory in not going deep into the grassroots and not understanding the situation at the lower levels.
    The second test result was better than the first, proving that this kind of test can urge leaders at all levels of enterprises to study their business and improve their work style. Other places may also want to try this method.

    试一试看
    包头市工业局最近举行了两次测验。参加测验的是该局所属企业的厂长、工程师、科长、车间主任、工段长和工会工作人员。测验的题目都是各工厂的基本情况。如厂内有些什么产品？多少车间、工段、小组？负责人是谁？1956年第一季度任务是多少？1月份完成多少？2月份任务多少？采取什么措施来完成2月份计划等等。
    可是，测验结果令人大吃一惊。第一次：参加测验的109人中，不及格的竟有95人，占总数的87％，其中得零分的就有35人。在10位厂长和8位工会主席中，及格的各只有一人。第二次测验结果比第一次较好，但是不及格的仍在47％以上。
    两次测验结果，就像一面无情的镜子，照出各工厂负责人员不深入基层、不了解下情的严重缺点。
    第二次测验成绩比第一次好，证明这种测验可以督促企业的各级领导人员钻研业务，改善作风。这种办法，其他地方也不妨试一试。
