The Yuntian Township Branch of the Communist Party in Changsha County, Hunan Province, when discussing the goal of increasing production by 35% this year to achieve an average yield of 1,000 jin per mu across the township, discovered that there were two schools of thought among the Party members. One was a conservative ideology, believing that such a large increase in production could not be accomplished no matter what, because they did not see the new situation after the basic collectivization of the township. The other was a blindly optimistic sentiment, believing that completing this production increase was no problem, because they only saw the unprecedentedly high enthusiasm of the vast number of cooperative members for increasing production. In order to overcome these two ideological biases, the branch guided all Party members to start from analyzing the specific situation, so that everyone could correctly understand the favorable conditions for increasing production and the existing difficulties. The favorable condition was that after the vast number of farmers joined the cooperatives, their enthusiasm for production was unprecedentedly high, and things that were previously considered impossible are now being done. For example, as soon as the Xinmin Cooperative was established, it built a large pond that no one had imagined for more than 100 years. The pond mud alone could fertilize more than 300 mu of farmland. The existing difficulty was that everyone still lacked experience in running large cooperatives. Last year, there were only three small cooperatives with a dozen households each in the township. This year, the smallest of the nine cooperatives has forty or fifty households, and the largest has nearly 200 households. Therefore, there were some problems in each cooperative, especially the labor organization problem, which was the most prominent, and the phenomenon of wasted work occurred constantly. After such a specific analysis, everyone saw the favorable aspects and also the difficulties, and everyone realized that right-leaning conservatism was wrong, and blind optimism was also wrong. The branch's task is to start by strengthening specific leadership over the cooperatives, give play to the favorable factors, overcome various difficulties, and strive to complete the 35% production increase target.

In order to strengthen the leadership over the cooperatives, the branch first helped the nine cooperatives establish three joint cooperatives, and selected a central cooperative in each joint cooperative. This made it easier to understand and study the situation, discover and solve problems. In order to understand the situation and discover problems in a timely manner, and also to exchange experiences and solve problems in a timely manner, the joint cooperatives held a meeting every two days.

The branch first discovered that the most common and prominent problem in the nine cooperatives was the problem of labor organization. If the contract labor system was not implemented, the labor enthusiasm of the cooperative members could not be further stimulated, and the phenomenon of wasted work could not be quickly eliminated. At that time, whether it was Party members or cadres, they only had the experience of temporary contract labor in small cooperatives, and these experiences were no longer suitable for running large cooperatives. For example, the Wuxing Cooperative was a large cooperative with more than 180 households, and the cooperative management committee still used the method of surveying land piece by piece to promote the contract labor system, based on the experience of running small cooperatives last year. As a result, after surveying for four or five days, they still had no clue, which affected the enthusiasm of some people for promoting the contract labor system. Therefore, the branch decided that the branch secretary Yi Juqiu should personally create contract labor experience in the Zhongnan Cooperative and then promote it. Yi Juqiu, based on the provisions of the draft cooperative charter and the specific situation of the cooperative, formulated the work quotas for various farm tasks on the basis of the cultivated areas and production teams that had been established in the cooperative. The method was to set the standard quota based on the amount and quality that a medium-level laborer can complete in a day, according to the difficulty, ease, distance, and proximity of the farm tasks. The remuneration standard was determined by the cooperative management committee, which ranked the main farm tasks in the four seasons and determined different remuneration standards according to the heavy work, light work, technical work, general work, and the busy and slack seasons. With the work quotas and remuneration standards, the cooperative committee contracted the main farm tasks to the production teams according to the different situations. For some farm tasks that could not be used to formulate work quotas and remuneration standards, the auxiliary method of production teams recording work points was used to solve the problem.

Because this system was fair and reasonable, it was warmly supported by the vast number of cooperative members, so it was quickly promoted. When this typical experience was introduced at the joint cooperative chairmen's meeting, the remaining eight cooperatives in the township quickly learned this contract labor method. And quickly eliminated the phenomenon of wasted work and waste. For example, the Xinyun Cooperative was established before last autumn and had more than 40 laborers. Due to the lack of a contract labor plan for a long time, the phenomenon of wasted work was very serious. If the cooperative chairman and production team leader did not call them, the cooperative members would not work, and the labor efficiency was not high even when they did work. After this cooperative implemented a reasonable contract labor system, the labor enthusiasm of the cooperative members was greatly improved. The cooperative had a water conservancy project that required more than 300 workdays, and it was completed within 7 days.

When encountering relatively prominent problems with a general nature, the Party branch also often held joint meetings of the cooperative chairmen to give play to everyone's wisdom and find solutions to the problems. For example, when the cooperatives were preparing to set this year's production plans, many cooperatives, although confident in increasing production, had no experience in how to set an annual effort goal and what measures to take to achieve this goal. Some cooperative chairmen said: "Just estimate it and set a plan"; some cooperative chairmen said: "It is difficult to plan with a lot of fields, just calculate how much double-cropping rice to transplant." At the cooperative chairmen's meeting, the chairman of the Zhongnan Cooperative, which had already set a plan, introduced their experience in setting the plan. They divided the paddy fields into three categories according to soil quality, sunshine, and wind direction, and then determined which types of fields to transplant double-cropping rice and which types of fields to transplant single-cropping rice, and finally formulated different production increase targets for each type of field. The plans set in this way were both more accurate and could encourage the production enthusiasm of the cooperative members. After this experience was introduced, the remaining eight cooperatives in the township all set their full-year production plans within 7 days.

When the cooperatives unanimously reflected that there was a shortage of double-cropping rice seeds, it was also studied at the cooperative chairmen's meeting. After everyone's discussion, it was believed that four methods could be adopted to solve the problem: (1) Exchange between cooperatives. For example, the Xinmin Cooperative was short of seeds, and the Wuxing Cooperative had a surplus of seeds, so it could exchange 1,000 jin to the Xinmin Cooperative; (2) Collect the surplus seeds from the cooperative members' homes and hand them over to a special person for safekeeping; (3) The nine cooperatives united and sent people to Liuyang County to exchange; (4) Each cooperative mobilized cooperative members to exchange with relatives. By adopting the above methods, the nine cooperatives quickly solved more than 3,500 jin of double-cropping rice seeds.

When individual cooperatives encountered difficulties and needed help from other cooperatives, the branch also convened a cooperative chairmen's contact meeting to solve the problem. For example, the Wuxing Cooperative urgently needed to build a pond, otherwise, the plan to expand the planting of double-cropping rice could not be completed. And to build this pond, 2,500 workdays were needed, and the cooperative did not have enough labor. At the meeting, each cooperative took the initiative to support the cooperative with 1,000 workdays (which will be repaid in the future). Now the cooperative's pond has been built, ensuring that more than 1,600 mu of land can be planted with double-cropping rice.

Because this branch carefully studied the new situation after basic collectivization and resolutely improved the leadership methods, the spring plowing preparation work of the entire township was done relatively well. The production plans of each cooperative have been set, all 84 water conservancy projects in the township have been repaired, and the fertilizer accumulation plan has been completed. Now the Party branch is leading the cooperatives and groups to carry out production increase competitions, and striving to achieve bumper harvests in every plot and a yield of 1,000 jin per mu in the autumn.

    支部要加强对合作社的具体领导
    胡兆龙　廖新华
    湖南省长沙县云田乡支部，在讨论今年增产35％，使全乡平均每亩产量达到1，000斤的时候，发现党员中存在着两种思想，一种是保守思想，认为无论如何也完不成这样大的增产任务，因为他们看不到全乡基本合作化以后的新形势；另一种是盲目乐观情绪，认为完成这个增产任务没问题，因为他们只看到广大社员空前高涨的增产热情。为了克服这两种思想偏向，支部就引导全体党员从分析具体情况着手，使大家正确认识增产的有利条件和存在的困难。有利条件是广大农民入社后，生产情绪空前提高，过去认为办不到的事现在办到了。如新民社一建立起来，就修了一口100多年来谁都想像不到的大塘，光挑起来的塘泥，就可肥田300多亩。存在的困难是，大家还缺乏办大社的经验，去年全乡只有三个十几户的小社，今年九个社最小的也有四、五十户，最大的就近200户。因此各个社都存在着一些问题，特别是劳动组织的问题最为突出，窝工的现象不断发生。经过这样具体的分析，就使大家看到有利的方面，也看到困难的方面，使大家认识到右倾保守是不对的，盲目乐观也是不对的。支部的任务就是要从加强对合作社的具体领导入手，发挥有利因素，克服各种困难，为完成35％的增产指标而努力。
    为了加强对合作社的领导，支部首先帮助九个社成立了三个联社，每个联社中又选择了一个中心社，这样就便于了解和研究情况，发现和解决问题。为了及时了解情况和发现问题也为了及时交流经验和解决问题，联社每隔两天就开一次碰头会。
    支部首先发现九个合作社中一个最普遍最突出的问题是劳力组织的问题，如果不实行包工制，社员的劳动积极性就不能进一步发挥，窝工的现象也不能迅速消除。当时不管是党员也好干部也好，只有办小社的临时包工的经验，这些经验已不能适应办大社的需要了。如五星社是180多户的大社，社务管理委员会还根据去年办小社的经验，采用一块一块土地摸底的办法推行包工制，结果，摸了四五天还没个头绪，这就影响了一部分人推行包工制的情绪。于是，支部就决定要支部书记易菊秋亲自到中南社创造包工经验，再来推广。易菊秋即根据社章草案的规定，结合这个社的具体情况，在这个社划好的耕作区和编好的生产队的基础上，制定了各项农活的工作定额。办法是根据农活的难、易、远、近，以一个中等劳动力一天所能完成的数量和质量为标准定额。报酬标准是由社务管理委员会把一年四季主要农活分别排队，根据重活、轻活、技术活、一般活和季节的忙、闲，确定不同的报酬标准。有了工作定额和报酬标准，就由社委会分别情况把主要农活包给生产队。对于有些不能制定工作定额和报酬标准的农活，则采用生产队记工评分的辅助办法解决。
    由于这个制度公平合理，得到广大社员的热烈拥护，所以很快就推行起来了。当这个典型经验在联社社长会议上介绍以后，全乡其余八个社就迅速学会了这种包工办法。并且迅速消灭了窝工浪费的现象，比如新云社是去年秋前建立的，有40多个劳动力，由于长期没有一个包工方案，窝工浪费现象很严重。社长、生产队长不去叫，社员就不出工，出了工劳动效率也不高。当这个社推行了合理的包工制度以后，社员的劳动积极性大为提高，社里有一项需要300多个工的水利工程，7天之内就完成了。
    遇到带普遍性的比较突出的问题，党支部还经常召开各社社长联席会，发挥大家的智慧，找出解决问题的办法。比如各社准备订今年的生产计划时，许多社虽然对增产有信心，但对如何制定一个全年的努力目标，以及达到这个目标要采取什么措施，是没有经验的。有的社长说：“估计一下，订个计划就行了”；有的社长说：“田多不好计划，插多少双季稻算多少。”在社长联席会上，就由已经制定计划的中南社社长介绍他们订计划的经验。他们是根据土质、阳光、风向把水田分成三类，然后确定那类田插双季稻，那类田插单季稻，最后再分别制定各类田不同的增产指标。这样订的计划既比较准确，又能够鼓舞社员的生产积极性。这个经验介绍后，全乡其余八个社在7天内都制定了今年全年的生产计划。
    当各社一致反映缺乏双季稻种子的时候，又在社长联席会上作了研究。经过大家的讨论，认为可以采取四种办法来解决，（一）社和社之间兑换，如新民社缺种子，五星社的种子还有剩余，可以兑换1，000斤给新民社；（二）收集兑换社员家里的多余种子，交专人保管起来；（三）九个社联合起来，派人到浏阳县去兑换；（四）各社发动社员到亲戚家去兑换。采取以上办法，九个社很快就解决了3，500多斤双季稻种子。
    当个别社发生困难需要其他社帮助的时候，支部也召开社长联系会解决。如五星社急需修一口水塘，否则，扩种双季稻的计划就不能完成。而修这口水塘，需工2，500个，这个社的劳力不够。在会上，各社主动支援这个社1，000个工（将来还工），现在这个社的水塘已经修好，保证了1，600多亩田可以种上双季稻。
    由于这个支部认真研究了基本合作化以后的新的情况，坚决改进了领导方法，就使整个乡的春耕准备工作做得比较好。各社的生产计划都制定了，全乡84处水利工程修好了，积肥计划也完成了。现在党支部正在领导社和社，组和组间开展增产竞赛，要努力争取在秋季达到丘丘丰产，亩亩千斤。
