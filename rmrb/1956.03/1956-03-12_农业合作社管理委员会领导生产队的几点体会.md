Some Experiences of the Management Committee of the Agricultural Cooperative in Leading Production Teams
Liu Changwen, Vice Chairman of the "May First" Collective Farm in Ninghe County, Hebei Province

    The "May First" Collective Farm was established on the basis of the Dongzhuangzi Agricultural Cooperative in Ninghe County, merged with seven other agricultural production cooperatives. The whole farm now has 577 households, 1,575 full and semi-laborers, divided into eight agricultural production teams and one sideline production team. We have learned that whether the production plan can be realized depends most importantly on how well the production teams are led.

		Laying a Good Foundation for the Production Team
    The allocation of personnel is the most important task in forming a production team. In 1954, we only paid attention to the allocation of male full laborers in each household, and did not pay attention to women and male semi-laborers in their teens. The male full laborers of each team were roughly balanced. However, the sixth team had fewer women and male semi-laborers, which resulted in the abandonment of more than ten mu of land; the third team had more women and male semi-laborers, which resulted in surplus labor. Later, some people were transferred from the third team to the sixth team, which solved the problem. In 1955, we appropriately allocated women and semi-laborers who had been participating in labor for a long time to each team. In this way, each team had the same number of women and semi-laborers who had been working for a long time, overcoming the phenomena of "abandoned land" and "idling". After the merger, the labor force and land were several times more than last year. We ranked the labor force according to their strength and skill level. Now each team has an average of more than 170 full and semi-laborers. Each team has seventy or eighty people who can transplant rice seedlings, four or five people who can manage rice paddies and control pests, and fifty or sixty women who have been working for a long time. Light work has been arranged for all 24 households of widows and orphans.
    In forming a production team, we must also pay close attention to the selection of the team leader and the allocation of backbone forces. We did not do enough meticulously in 1954. Dong Chaojun, the captain of the ninth team, often lost his temper, and there were frequent fights in the team. The backbone was not united, and the captain and the team members often quarreled, which caused the team to split into two factions. This year, attention has been paid to the allocation of backbone forces, which has ensured the activity of political life and the realization of production tasks in each team.
    The production team should not be divided too small. In 1954, the Dongzhuangzi Cooperative Farm with 99 households was divided into 9 production teams, with an average of more than ten households per team, and as few as six or seven households. In this way, the backbone forces were dispersed, it was not easy to concentrate the opinions of each team, and the draft animals and farm implements could not be "pulled apart". It was not enough to divide two animals to each team, and it was impossible to use three animals. As a result, some animals lost their fat, some got sick from overwork, and some were injured. Because each team had its own seedling hills and wheat fields, 17 waterwheels were not enough, and some waterwheels had to be moved frequently, which wasted labor and shortened the life of the farm implements. Because there were too many teams, the backbone forces and technicians could not be allocated, and the fifth and ninth teams reduced the production of rice by 11,000 catties. In 1955, the number of draft animals and farm implements was much less than in 1954, calculated by the number of households and the number of laborers. However, because the teams were divided reasonably, the draft animals and farm implements were sufficient.

		Using the Experience of Advanced Teams to Guide the General
    In order to absorb advanced experience in a timely manner, last year our Management Committee decided to focus on the sixth team. Any new work was helped and encouraged to be tried out first. For example, from the Spring Festival to the rice transplanting stage, there was a lot of work to be done, such as digging and transporting fertilizer, raising and filling low-lying areas, plowing furrows, leveling seedling hills, adding wind barriers, and repairing houses for the villagers, all of which had to be completed during the same period. We helped the key team to take the lead in making a labor force use plan, so that both male and female full and semi-laborers could give full play to their roles. With a long-term plan, we also used the team leader and group leader meeting every night to specifically study what work to do the next day and the day after tomorrow and who to do it. This short-term daily arrangement ensures the rational allocation of labor. After the Management Committee disseminated this method to each team in a timely and concrete manner, the production teams with more serious idling phenomena also learned how to solve the problem of not being able to allocate labor.
    According to the habit of previous years, the row spacing and plant spacing of rice paddies were generally 7 inches. In order to increase yield, the Management Committee decided to promote close planting and changed it to 6 inches. At the beginning, some teams unanimously believed that close planting would not grow well, some team leaders agreed but the team members did not, and some were skeptical and took a wait-and-see attitude. The Management Committee first launched the sixth team to start, and then organized each team to visit. In this way, the method of close planting was fully promoted.
    In order to lead the production teams well, in addition to being responsible for different professions, the members of the Management Committee, the chairman and vice-chairman, constantly patrol and inspect, help each team with ideas and solve problems. However, when work gets busy, the inspections are not timely, and the big and small problems of each team occur one after another. Frequent inspections are necessary; more importantly, the captains should be taught how to be good captains. What are some methods? How to teach them? After research, the Management Committee decided to base on the experience of the sixth team captain, add supplements, and then promote it in all teams in the village. How to be a good production team leader? The experience of the sixth team summarized by everyone is: the captain should be "five fast": the first is "fast heart", what to do today, what to do tomorrow, how to allocate labor, what kind of work to arrange for the old and weak labor, all should be thought of and remembered according to the labor force use plan; the second is "fast eye", always see clearly which group and which person is working well, and what problems are there in which place in the team; the third is "fast hand", should lead production by production, and do all kinds of work by oneself, do it well, do it fast, and take the lead everywhere; the fourth is "fast leg", frequently and deeply check the members' completion of work; the fifth is "fast mouth", what should be said must be said, what should be criticized must be criticized in time, do not be afraid of offending people, and the good people and deeds that should be commended should be commended in time. After learning the experience of the sixth team, the captains of each team unanimously reflected: after mastering these five points, they have a plan in their hearts, and if they strengthen their sense of responsibility, they can do the work of the production team well.	  Strengthen the unity between teams and carry out team-to-team competition

    Some positive and deputy captains often have some varying degrees of localist ideas. The Management Committee should regularly educate these people, enlighten everyone to carry out criticism and self-criticism, and constantly improve their socialist consciousness and enhance their collective concept. When transplanting rice last year, the seventh team planned to borrow a cart from the fourth team to transport rice straw. Yang Fucheng, the captain of the fourth team, said "there is no free cart", but used the cart to pull grass bags for individual team members. At a meeting, everyone criticized him and said: "If any team fails to transplant rice on time, the loss of production will be a loss to the whole village. You only care about yourselves, and you don't lend the cart to the public, but let individuals sell grass bags, which is a lack of collectivist thinking." With the help of everyone, Yang Fucheng realized his mistake.
    The first team and the second team use a branch canal for irrigation. The land of the first team is high and uneven. In principle, the first team should be allowed to release water first. However, due to the influence of localist thinking, the deputy captains of the two teams would not give way to each other, and they started to have opinions. The Management Committee criticized the two deputy captains, and they also made self-criticisms and strengthened unity.
    We carried out labor competitions between teams according to the seasons. This is a good way to improve the villagers' socialist consciousness and increase production. Last year, we planned to produce an average of 770 catties of rice per mu. At that time, some captains could not accept it, and some said: "Who is sure of such a high yield? Just do it blindly!" In the first fertilizer accumulation competition, 3,600 carts of fertilizer were accumulated in a short period of time, and the villagers' labor enthusiasm was also particularly high, and they began to break the conservative thinking. Then, several consecutive competitions were carried out: the second competition was to use water reasonably, level and rake the land carefully, plant closely and reasonably, and complete the rice transplanting task on time. The content of the third competition was to harrow the rice fields three to four times, hoe the dry fields four to five times to ensure that the land was clean and weed-free; and accumulate a large amount of high-quality fertilizer in summer. The content of the fourth competition was mainly to harvest carefully and return the grains home. After carrying out labor competitions between teams, the conservative thinking was broken, and the whole village's 2,200 mu of rice fields produced an average of 830 catties of rice per mu, exceeding the original plan by 7.8%.

    农业合作社管理委员会领导生产队的几点体会
    河北省宁河县“五一”集体农庄副主席　刘长文
    “五一”集体农庄，是在宁河县董庄子合作农庄的基础上，同另外七个农业生产合作社合并建成的。现在全庄共577户，男女整半劳力1，575人，划分了八个农业生产队，一个副业生产队。我们体会到：生产计划能不能实现，最重要的就是看对生产队领导的好坏。
              打好生产队的基础
    人员的搭配是编制生产队的最重要的工作。1954年，我们只注意了各户的男整劳动力的搭配，没注意到妇女和十几岁的男半劳动力。各队的男整劳动力是大体平衡的。可是，第六队妇女和男半劳动力少，就荒了十几亩地；第三队妇女和男半劳动力多，劳动力有剩余。后来从三队拨出来一些人给六队，才解决了问题。1955年，我们把长期参加劳动的妇女和半劳动力都适当搭配到各队。这样，各队都有一样多的长期劳动的妇女和半劳动力，克服了“荒地”和“窝工”等现象。合并社以后，劳动力和土地都比去年多了好几倍。我们按劳动力强弱、技术高低进行了排队。现在每队平均有整半劳动力170多人。各队都有七、八十人会插秧，有四、五个人会管理秧田、治虫，每队有长期参加劳动的妇女五、六十人。对24户孤寡户，都给安置了轻活。
    编制生产队，还要十分注意队长的选择和骨干力量的配备。1954年我们作的不够细致。第九队队长董朝俊经常发脾气，队里常打架，骨干不团结，队长和队员常闹别扭，闹得一个队分两派。今年注意了骨干力量的配备，就保证了各队的政治生活的活跃和生产任务的实现。
    生产队不能划得太小。1954年董庄子合作农庄99户就划了9个生产队，平均每队十多户，少的六、七户。这样骨干力量分散，各队意见不易集中，耕畜农具“拉不开栓”，每队分两头牲口不够用，分三头牲口用不了。这样，有的牲口就得轮流使。结果，牲口都掉了膘，有的累病了，有的使伤了。因为各队都有自己的秧丘和麦田，17台水车也不够用了，有的水车得经常搬家，浪费了人工，缩短了农具的寿命。因为队多，骨干力量和技术人员分配不开，五队和九队共减产11，000斤稻谷。1955年，按户数和劳动力人数计算，牲口农具比1954年少的多。可是，因为队划分得合理了，牲口农具足够用。
        运用先进队的经验指导一般
    为了及时吸取先进经验，去年我们管委会确定以第六队为重点队，有什么新工作就帮助和鼓励他们先试办。如：春节至插秧阶段，工作多，挖肥运肥、起高垫洼、平犁沟、整秧丘、加风障、庄员修房，这些都必须在同一期间搞完。我们帮助重点队带头作了劳动力使用计划，使男女整半劳动力都能充分地发挥作用。有了长计划，又利用每天晚上的队长组长碰头会，具体研究第二天第三天干什么活和让谁去干。这样逐日短安排，保证了合理支配劳动力。管委会把这办法及时具体传播到各队以后，窝工现象较严重的生产队也学会了解决劳动力支配不开的问题的办法。
    按往年的习惯，稻田插秧一般行距株距都是7寸。为了提高产量，管委会决定推行密植，改为6寸。开始，有些队一致认为密植长不好，有的队长通了队员不通，有的半信不疑采取观望态度。管委会先发动第六队作起，然后组织各队参观。这样，就全面地推行了密植的方法。
    为了把生产队领导好，管委会委员除了分业负责以外，正副主席还不断地巡回检查，帮助各队出主意和解决问题。可是，工作一忙，也就检查不及时了，各队的大小问题也就一个跟着一个，经常发生。勤检查是必要的；更重要的是教队长们懂得当好队长的方法。有些什么方法？怎样教给呢？管委会研究了以后，决定以第六队队长的经验为基础，再加补充，然后在全庄各队推行。怎样当好生产队长呢？大家总结出来的第六队的经验是：队长要做到“五快”：第一是“心快”，今天干啥，明天又干啥，劳力怎样支配，老弱劳动力安排什么活计，都按劳动力使用计划想好记好；第二是“眼快”，随时看清楚哪个组哪个人干活怎么样，本队哪个地方有什么问题；第三是“手快”，应当以生产领导生产，各种工作自己都干出个样子来，干得好，干得快，处处带头；第四是“腿快”，经常地深入地检查社员完成工作的情况；第五是“嘴快”，该说的话一定要说，该批评的也要及时批评，不要怕得罪人，该表扬的好人好事，及时表扬。学习了第六队的经验以后，各队队长一致反映：掌握住这五条，心里就有了谱，自己再加强责任心，就能把生产队的工作做好了。	  加强各队间的团结，开展队和队的竞赛
    部分正副队长中时常出现一些程度不同的本位主义思想，管委会要对这些人经常进行教育，启发大家开展批评和自我批评，不断提高他们的社会主义觉悟，增强集体观念。去年插秧的时候七队打算借四队的车运稻草，四队队长杨福成说“没闲车”，却用车给队员个人拉草袋。在一次会议上，大家批评他说：“哪队不能按时插秧，减了产都是全庄的损失。你们光顾自己，有车不借给公家，让私人卖草袋去，就是没有集体主义思想。”杨福成在大家的帮助下，认识了自己的错误。
    一队和二队使用一条支渠灌溉，一队的土地高洼不平，按道理应该让一队先放水。可是由于本位主义思想的影响，两个队的副队长谁也不让，闹起意见来。管委会对两个副队长进行了批评，他们自己也作了检讨，加强了团结。
    我们按季节开展了队和队之间的劳动竞赛。这是提高庄员的社会主义觉悟和增加产量的好办法。去年我们计划每亩平均产稻谷770斤，当时有些队长接受不了，有的说：“这么高的产量，谁有把握？就是蒙着干呗！”第一次竞赛积肥，一阵就积了3，600车肥料，庄员们的劳动热情也特别高涨，才开始打破了保守思想。接着，连续开展了几次竞赛：第二次的竞赛内容是合理用水，土地整平耙细，合理密植，按时完成插秧任务。第三次竞赛的内容是稻田挠草三至四遍，旱田锄草四至五遍，保证地净草无；夏季积肥量多、质高。第四次竞赛内容主要是精收细打，颗粒返家。开展了队和队之间的劳动竞赛以后，打破了保守思想，全庄2，200多亩稻田平均每亩产稻谷830斤，超过了原定计划7.8％。
