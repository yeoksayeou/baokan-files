    Turn Drops of Experience into Common Wealth

    Lin Ruiting said, "If we only rely on one group's efforts to build a house, even if one person can do the work of two, it's still only equivalent to two groups. If all construction workers in the city can double their efficiency this year, then we can complete two years' worth of tasks in one year."
    Lin Ruiting is a Chengdu municipal model worker and the leader of a carpentry group in the Second Construction Engineering Company of Sichuan Province. The group he leads is a model group in Chengdu. Upholding the spirit of universal improvement, they have successively and concretely helped eight carpentry groups, totaling 104 people, improve their work efficiency.
    This model group has many advanced experiences that are worth learning from other carpenters. In 1955, Lin Ruiting went to various construction sites in the province and in the Central and Southern regions to learn thirty-seven kinds of advanced experiences, all of which were promoted within the group. The whole group completed the state plan eleven days ahead of schedule and saved the state more than six thousand yuan in construction costs.
    The group members often said: All our technical improvements in operation and achievements in production have been obtained through the help of others, so we should also help others. In the past six months, they have held five advanced experience performances and lectures on the construction site. In January of this year, at the 221 construction site, they found that the efficiency of carpenters making "hollow floor slabs" and "composite panels" was relatively low, so they specifically introduced advanced experiences such as assembly line operations. The Li Huashan group originally only reached 55.8% of the quota. After the Lin Ruiting group helped them implement the assembly line method, they exceeded the quota by 3.5%. When making and installing "inlaid floor slabs," the Lin Ruiting group, in order to better help other carpentry groups improve work efficiency, mixed the carpenters from other groups with their own and specifically guided them to learn advanced operations and use advanced tools in actual operation. This method was very effective. The Zhuo Bingliang and Guo Shaoqing groups quickly caught up with the production level of the Lin Ruiting group.
    The Lin Ruiting group often sends people out to spread their experience at the invitation of carpenters from other places. Group members Luo Chengzhang and others once went to the Chengdu Nursing School construction site to help install the main beam; Deng Taibin went to Xinfan County to help build a water tower. Carpenters from Changning County wrote letters requesting an introduction to advanced experience, and the Lin Ruiting group enthusiastically replied and sent them four sets of advanced tools and nine blueprints.
    When formulating this year's plan, the Lin Ruiting group not only proposed to complete two years' worth of work in one year, but also put forward the slogan "one person help one group." They plan to specifically help twenty-six carpentry groups with 338 people this year through "study abroad," lectures, mutual visits and performances, helping to manufacture tools, and mastering advanced operations, so that they can break through the national unified quota for the construction industry by an average of 20%.
    Group leader Lin Ruiting said, "We have a responsibility to introduce our drops of experience and make them the common wealth of everyone."

    把点滴经验变成共同的财富
    向波
    林瑞廷说：“修一幢房子，如果只是我们一个小组努力，就算一个人能顶两个人，也只能顶两个小组。如果全市建筑工人能在今年提高工效一倍，那末一年就能完成两年的任务。”
    林瑞廷是成都市工业劳动模范、四川省第二建筑工程公司一个木工小组的组长。他所领导的小组是成都市的模范小组。他们本着普遍提高的精神，先后具体帮助了八个木工组共104人，提高了工作效率。
    这个模范小组有许多先进经验是值得其他木工学习的。1955年，林瑞廷到本省和中南区各个建筑工地去学了三十七种先进经验，都在小组内推广了，全组提前十一天全面地完成国家计划，并给国家节省了六千多元的建筑费。
    组员们常常谈到：我们操作技术上的各种改进，生产上的成绩，都是经过别人的帮助得来的，因此我们也应该帮助别人。最近半年多来，他们在工地上举行五次先进经验表演和讲解。今年一月间，在221工地上，他们发现木工们制作“空心楼板”和“合子板”的效率比较低，就具体介绍了流水作业等先进经验。黎华山小组原来只能达到定额55.8％，林瑞廷小组帮助他们实行流水作业法以后，就超过定额3.5％。在制作和安装“嵌花楼板”的时候，林瑞廷小组为了更好地帮助其他小组木工提高工作效率，把外组的木工和本组的混合编队，在实际操作中具体指导他们学习先进操作，使用先进工具。这个办法很有效。卓炳良、郭绍清两个小组很快就赶上了林瑞廷小组的生产水平。
    林瑞廷小组常常应外地木工的邀请，派人出去传播他们的经验。组员罗成章等四人曾经到成都护士学校工地帮助安大梁；邓太彬到新繁县帮助修建水塔。常宁县的木工们来信要求介绍先进经验，林瑞廷小组就热情地给他们复信，并赠送四套先进工具和九张蓝图给他们。
    林瑞廷小组在制定今年规划的时候，不但提出一年完成两年的工作量，而且提出了“一个人帮助一个组”的口号，计划今年要通过“留学”、讲解、互相参观表演，帮助制造工具和掌握先进操作等办法，具体帮助二十六个木工小组338人，使他们能够平均突破全国建筑业统一定额20％。
    组长林瑞廷说：“我们有责任把点滴经验介绍出来，使它们成为大家的共同财富。”
