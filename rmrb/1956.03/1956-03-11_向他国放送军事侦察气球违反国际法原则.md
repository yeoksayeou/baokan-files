Sending Military Reconnaissance Balloons to Other Countries Violates Principles of International Law
China Political Science and Law Association Director Chen Tiqiang

    Recently, the United States has sent a large number of military reconnaissance balloons into the airspace of China, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Bulgaria, Albania, and Sweden. Regarding this provocative act by the United States, the spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on February 7, expressing a serious protest. The Soviet Union and other countries have also lodged protests successively. The Soviet Union's protest on February 4 pointed out sternly that the United States' action "is a rude violation of Soviet airspace and a sabotage of recognized principles of international law."

    Faced with protests from all over the world, the United States authorities have tried to deny their crimes with various sophistries. However, these sophistries are contradictory and full of loopholes, and cannot alleviate the United States' crime of violating international law in the slightest. For example, on February 6, the United States Navy authorities claimed that there were no photographic devices in the balloons, but on the same day, United States State Department spokesman White admitted that the balloons were equipped with cameras and radios, but said this was to "collect meteorological materials." On February 7, United States Secretary of State Dulles admitted at a press conference that the balloons carried cameras, but said it was to take pictures of cloud layers, although "quite accidentally" some ground photos were also taken. In order to more thoroughly defend the illegal behavior of the United States, Dulles even attempted to obliterate the sovereignty of the state over its territory's airspace, saying: "The question of ownership of the higher layers of the atmosphere is a matter of dispute, and the ownership of the ether above the atmosphere is also a matter of dispute."

    Dulles's assertion is truly a "major discovery" in international law!

    Before the 20th century, before the development of aviation, there was indeed a dispute in international law circles regarding the issue of sovereignty over the airspace above territory. Scholars had three main opinions on the issue of airspace sovereignty: one believed that airspace was free like the high seas; one believed that a country's sovereignty over airspace only extended to a certain height, and above that height, airspace was free; and one believed that national sovereignty extended to an unlimited height. But this dispute had long been resolved. Soviet Professor Korovin pointed out in an article published in 1934 that this dispute "has ended in international agreements and national legislations by recognizing the sovereignty of the state over its adjacent airspace" (Korovin: "The Conquest of the Stratosphere and International Law," published in the "General Review of International Law" magazine, 1934, Vol. 41, p. 677, Paris).

    The notion that a country has unlimited sovereignty over its airspace was endorsed by many famous international law scholars at the time, such as Baldwin, Liszt, Ullmann, and Kollard. Even the French international law jurist Fauchille, who initially advocated "freedom of the air" most strongly, had to write in 1910 acknowledging that free and open high altitude was unworkable. He admitted: "A two-zone system can never fully guarantee the interests of the countries below. … Airplanes, no matter how high people imagine them to fly, can always drop infectious or prohibited things just as well" (Fauchille: "Aviation and International Law in Peacetime," published in the "International Legal Review of Aviation Issues" magazine, 1910, first issue). Similarly, another international law professor, Catellani, wrote in a book "Aviation Law" published in 1912: "Over the territory of a state, the sovereignty of that state extends to an unlimited height, in order to guarantee its full sovereignty over the territory below" (p. 6).

    United States international law scholars agree with the vast majority of scholars around the world on this point, and in their writings almost without exception acknowledge the aerial sovereignty of states. In a document collectively researched by all the prominent international law scholars in the United States, they firmly stated: "Whether or not this principle of sovereignty is desirable, it has been clearly established in international law and has been accepted here" (Harvard University International Law Research: "Draft Convention on the Rights and Duties of Neutral States in Naval Warfare and Air Warfare," published in "American Journal of International Law," 1939, Vol. 33 Supplement, p. 766). In 1939, at the beginning of World War II, Nazi German aircraft had repeatedly flown over the airspace of the Netherlands, Belgium, and other countries, citing the reason that "airspace does not exceed 3 miles." United States international law scholar Kuhn wrote to refute this argument of Germany: "Due to the rapid development of flight technology, and due to the increasingly deadly nature of bombs and other weapons carried on aircraft during wartime, it is impossible to recognize any height limit on the sovereignty of the countries below. This was fully recognized in the 1923 report of the Hague Jurists Committee on revising the rules of war" (Kuhn: "The Question of the Flight of Belligerents over Neutral Territory 3 Miles or More above a Height Limit," published in the same book, 1940, Vol. 34, p. 107).

    On this issue, international treaties and scholarly opinions are equally clear. Article 1 of the 1919 "Air Convention" clearly stipulates: "The contracting States recognize that every State has complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory." Article 1 of the 1926 "International Air Navigation Convention," Article 1 of the 1928 "Commercial Aviation Convention," and Article 1 of the 1944 "International Civil Aviation Convention" signed in Chicago all have the same provisions. Many conventions that stipulate the rights and obligations of belligerents and neutrals during wartime are also based on the principle that countries have sovereignty over airspace, stipulating that each country has the right to prohibit foreign aircraft from entering its airspace. The 1928 Havana "Maritime Neutrality Convention" and the 1923 "Hague Air Rules" (not ratified) are obvious examples. The "Digest of International Law" compiled by Hackworth, the legal adviser of the United States State Department, published in 1942, wrote: "Various multilateral and bilateral conventions and agreements are now based on the assumption that states have exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above their territory and territorial waters" (Vol. 4, p. 358).

    In addition, examples of national legislation in various countries that stipulate the principle of aerial sovereignty are readily available. For example, Italy's order of September 3, 1914, the Netherlands' order of August 3 of the same year, Norway's King's decision of November 6 of the same year, and Sweden's law of September 7 of the same year, all prohibit foreign aircraft from arbitrarily entering airspace based on the state's sovereignty over airspace. Switzerland's order of August 14 of the same year specifically stipulates that foreign aircraft and "balloons" are absolutely not allowed to enter Swiss airspace. Section 6, Item A of the United States' own 1926 "Air Commerce Act" also stipulates: "It is hereby declared that the United States of America has and exercises complete and exclusive national sovereignty in the airspace above the United States..."

    In international law, the principle that a country has sovereignty over airspace is so certain and so unshakable, so Dulles's attempt to make a big reversal on this issue, attempting to obliterate 50 years of international law development history, is really clumsy and ridiculous. The international law principle has been unquestionably established: the United States' sending balloons to countries such as China and the Soviet Union, regardless of any pretext, is absolutely illegal and is an infringement of the airspace sovereignty of other countries.

    Even aside from this point, the other sophistries of the United States are completely untenable. The United States' claim that balloons do not obstruct traffic has been shattered by the tragic accident in Czechoslovakia in which an aircraft collided with a balloon and crashed. The United States' claim that its balloons are for "collecting meteorological materials" and for "scientific research" has also been exposed by the balloons themselves, which were exhibited in Beijing. Anyone who has visited the exhibition can clearly see that the entire role of the balloon is to engage in aerial photography and reconnaissance. All parts of the balloon serve the camera. Of the total weight of 600 kilograms of equipment, the meteorological part is only a small box weighing less than half a kilogram, which contains a very simple meteorological instrument, and its transmission capacity can only reach about 100 kilometers, and its battery can only last for two or three hours. May I ask, what is the use of placing such an instrument on a balloon that flies tens of thousands of miles and lasts for seven or eight days, other than to conceal its military reconnaissance nature? Dulles said that balloons can only "quite accidentally" take pictures of ground objects. This may be a very regrettable thing for him. However, despite being "quite accidental," it has after all taken many pictures of the ground. Many of the photos on display clearly show China's mountains, cities, railways, stations, ports, and even airports. Are these not very useful materials for United States espionage work? United States news agencies have publicly reported that these balloons were sent out by United States military authorities. This has never been denied by any United States official. One cannot help but wonder: why is it not United States scientists who are so concerned about "scientific research," but United States soldiers?

    This question has now been answered by "U.S. News & World Report," a magazine close to the United States government. An article published in the magazine on February 17 openly boasted: "These long-range balloons are another weapon with great potential," because these balloons "could tomorrow carry incendiary bombs, television cameras, nuclear bombs, bacteria, or poison gas." The author of the article wrote triumphantly: "These balloons can even be used as tools for large-scale espionage, each balloon carrying equipment on top, which can send photos to a submarine near the coast every 10 minutes." This is exactly what the United States is doing now.

    People remember that recently the United States government, regarding the issue of disarmament, has repeatedly insisted on implementing the so-called "aerial photography" and "open skies" plan, its purpose is to try to use this method to steal military intelligence from the Soviet Union, China, the People's Democratic countries, and all countries that are unwilling to serve the United States' aggressive policies. Due to the Soviet Union's opposition, this plan has not been able to be realized. Now the United States is using high-altitude balloon photography, precisely to achieve through illegal means what it cannot achieve at the negotiating table. As long as you connect these many things together, the problem is very clear.

    Previously, the United States had made every effort to deny its illegal behavior. Since the Soviet Union proposed to publicly exhibit United States balloons in several major cities around the world, the United States' tone has been significantly lowered. Now these balloons have been exhibited in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and China successively. In full view of the public, the evidence is complete, the case is ironclad, and the United States is absolutely not allowed to make any more denials. This provocative act by the United States to infringe upon the territorial sovereignty of other countries is a serious violation of international law. We have the right to demand that the United States immediately stop this act of aggression and bear all responsibility for the serious consequences of its actions.

    向他国放送军事侦察气球违反国际法原则
    中国政治法律学会理事　陈体强
    最近期间，美国曾向中国、苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚和瑞典各国的领空放送大量军事侦察气球。对于美国这一挑衅行为，我国外交部发言人曾于2月7日发表声明，表示严重抗议。苏联等国家也都先后提出了抗议。苏联2月4日的抗议严正地指出：美国的这种行为“是对苏联领空粗暴的侵犯，是对公认的国际法原则的破坏。”
    面对着来自世界各地的抗议，美国当局曾力图用各种诡辩来抵赖它的罪行。但是这种诡辩互相矛盾、漏洞百出，丝毫不能够减轻美国破坏国际法的罪行。例如，2月6日，美国海军当局宣称气球中并没有照像设备，但是，同日美国国务院发言人怀特却承认气球上装有摄影机和无线电，但说这是为了“收集气象材料”。2月7日，美国国务卿杜勒斯在记者招待会上承认气球带有摄影机，但说是为了摄取云层的照片，虽然“十分偶然地”也摄取了一些地面照片。杜勒斯为了更彻底地替美国的非法行为辩护，竟然企图抹煞国家对它的领土的上空的主权，他说：“较高的空气层的所有权问题是一个争执的问题，空气上面的以太的所有权也是一个争执的问题。”
    杜勒斯的这个论断，真是国际法上的一个“大发现”！
    在20世纪以前，在航空事业还没有发达以前，国际法学界对于领土上空的主权问题确曾发生过争论。学者们对于空中主权问题大别有三种意见：一种认为空中和公海一样，是自由的；一种认为国家对空中的主权只达到一定高度，超过这个高度空中便是自由的；一种认为国家主权达到无限高。但是这个争论老早已经解决。苏联柯洛文教授在1934年发表的一篇文章中指出，这种争论“已经在国际协定和各国国内立法中以承认国家对其毗连的上空的主权而告终”（柯洛文：“同温层的征服和国际法”，载“国际法一般评论”杂志，1934年，第41卷，第677页，巴黎出版）。
    国家对其上空拥有无限主权的说法，为当时许多著名的国际法学者如鲍德温、李斯特、乌勒曼、柯拉德等所赞同。就是当初主张“空中自由”最力的法国国际法学家傅希尔，也不得不在1910年著文承认高空自由开放是行不通的。他承认：“两区制度是永远不能充分保障下面国家的利益的。……飞机，不论人们设想它能飞多高，总是能够同样地把有感染性的或违禁的东西投掷下来”（傅希尔：“飞行与平时国际法”，载“飞行问题的国际法律评论”杂志，1910年，第一期）。同样，另一位国际法教授卡特兰尼在1912年出版的一本“航空法”中写道：“在国家上空，这个国家的主权达到无限高，以便保证它在下面的领土上的充分主权”（第6页）。
    美国国际法学者在这一点上是和世界各国绝大多数学者意见一致的，在他们的著作中几乎无例外地承认国家的空中主权。在由美国所有著名国际法学者集体研究的一个文件中，他们确定不移地说：“不管这个主权原则是否可取，它是已明白地在国际法中确立起来了，并且已在这里被接受了”（哈佛大学国际法研究：“关于中立国在海战和空战中的权利和义务的公约草案”，载“美国国际法学报”，1939年，第33卷补编，第766页）。1939年，在第二次世界大战初期，纳粹德国的飞机曾经以“领空不超过3英里”为理由，不断地飞越荷、比等国的上空。美国国际法学者库恩为了驳斥德国的这一论点写道：“由于飞行技术日新月异，并且由于战争时期飞机上携带炸弹和其他武器日益致命，承认下面的国家的主权有任何高度的限制，是不可能的。这已于1923年被海牙法学家委员会关于修改战争规则的报告所完全承认”（库恩：“交战国在中立领土上空3英里或其他高度限度以上飞行的问题”，载同上书，1940年，第34卷，第107页）。
    在这个问题上，国际条约和学者的见解是同样明确的。1919年的“航空公约”第一条明文规定：“各缔约国承认，各国对于其领土上空拥有完全和排他性的主权。”1926年在马德里签订的“国际航空公约”、1928年的“商业航空公约”第一条和1944年在芝加哥签订的“国际民用航空公约”第一条也有同样的规定。许多规定战争时期交战国和中立国的权利和义务的公约，也都以国家对上空拥有主权的原则为基础，规定各国有权禁止外国飞机进入它的上空。1928年哈瓦那“海上中立公约”和1923年“海牙航空规则”（未批准），就是明显的例子。1942年美国国务院出版的它的法律顾问哈克倭斯编的“国际法汇编”一书中写道：“各种多边公约和双边公约和协定，现在都是以这样的假设为根据，即国家对于它的领土和领水的上空拥有排他性的主权”（第4卷，第358页）。
    此外，各国国内立法中规定空中主权原则的例子也是俯拾即是的。例如意大利1914年9月3日的命令、荷兰同年8月3日的命令、挪威同年11月6日的国王决定、瑞典同年9月7日的法律，都是根据国家对上空的主权而禁止外国飞机任意进入领空。瑞士同年8月14日的命令特别规定外国飞机和“气球”绝对不许进入瑞士上空。美国自己的1926年“空中商务法”第6节甲项也规定：“现在宣布：美国对于美国……上空拥有并行使完全和排他性的国家主权”。
    在国际法上，国家对上空拥有主权的原则是如此确定、如此不可动摇，因此杜勒斯想在这个问题上大做翻案文章，企图抹煞50年来国际法的发展历史，实在令人觉得笨拙可笑。国际法的这条原则无可置疑地确立了：美国向中苏等国放送气球，无论用什么借口，都是绝对非法的，是对别国领空主权的侵犯。
    即使撇开这点不讲，美国的其他诡辩也是完全站不住脚的。美国所说气球不妨碍交通的说法，已被在捷克斯洛伐克发生的飞机碰撞气球失事的惨案所粉碎。美国所说它的气球是为了“收集气象材料”、是为了“科学研究”的说法，也被这次在北京展览的气球本身所揭穿。凡是参观过展览的人，没有不看得很清楚：整个气球的作用就是从事空中摄影和侦察。气球的所有部分都是为照像机服务。全部重600公斤的设备中，有关气象的部分只是一个重量不及半公斤的小盒子，里边装的是一个最简单的测候仪器，它的发报能力只能达到100公里左右，它的蓄电池只能维持二三小时。试问这样一个仪器放在一个飞飘万里、历时七八天的气球上，除了用来掩饰它的军事侦察性质以外，还有什么用处？杜勒斯说气球只能“十分偶然地”拍摄地面事物。这对他来说可能是一件很可遗憾的事。但是，尽管“十分偶然地”，它毕竟也摄取了不少地面的照片。展览出来的照片中有许多清楚地显示着中国的山川、城市、铁路、车站、港口，乃至飞机场。这些难道不是对美国谍报工作十分有用的材料吗？美国的通讯社公开报道，这些气球都是美国军事当局放送出来的。这点从来没有受到美国官方的任何否认。人们不能不奇怪：为什么对“科学研究”这样关心的不是美国的科学家，而是美国的军人？
    这个问题现在已经由美国一家和政府接近的杂志“美国新闻与世界报道”作了解答。该杂志于2月17日发表的一篇文章中公然吹嘘：“这种航程很远的气球原来又是一种具有巨大潜力的武器”，因为这种气球“明天就可能带着燃烧弹、电视摄影机、核子炸弹、细菌或毒气。”文章的作者得意忘形地写道：“这种气球甚至可以用来作为进行大规模间谍工作的工具，每一气球带有装在上面的器械，可以每隔10分钟把照片拍送到一艘在海岸附近的潜水艇上去。”这正是美国现在所作的勾当。
    人们记得，近来美国政府关于裁军问题，曾一再坚持要实行所谓“空中摄影”和“开放天空”的计划，它的目的就是企图用这种方法来窃取苏联、中国、人民民主国家以及一切不甘心为美国的侵略政策服务的国家的军事情报。由于苏联的反对，这个计划没有能够实现。现在美国使用高空气球摄影，正是想用这种非法手段来达到它在会议桌上所达不到的目的。只要把这许多事情联系起来看，问题便很清楚了。
    以前美国曾对它的违法行为百般抵赖。自从苏联提出要把美国气球在世界几个大城市公开展览之后，美国的声调显著地放低了。现在这些气球已经在苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和中国先后展出了。众目睽睽之下，物证俱在，铁案如山，绝不容美国再作任何抵赖了。美国的这种侵犯他国领土主权的挑衅行为是对国际法的严重破坏。我们有权利要求美国立即停止这种侵略行为，并对它的行为的严重后果负担一切责任。
