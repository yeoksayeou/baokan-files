    Investigation Report from the People's Daily Readers' Letters Department

    Comrade Su Ke from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions' Workers' Living Conditions Investigation Group wrote a letter reflecting the Beijing State-Owned No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory's lack of concern for the living welfare of its workers. When we verified the facts with the Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, the factory believed that many of the situations mentioned in this criticism did not match the facts, and many issues involved expenditure principles stipulated by higher authorities, which the factory could not resolve. In addition, they also raised many criticisms of the work of the Workers' Living Conditions Investigation Group, believing that this article had already caused ideological confusion among the factory staff during the process of verifying the facts, and that if published, it would put the factory in a state where it could not work.

    In order to further verify the facts and clarify the truth, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions invited relevant departments such as the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the China Textile Trade Union, the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Textile Trade Union, the Ministry of Textile Industry, as well as the party, administrative, and trade union leaders of the Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, to hold a meeting to study this issue.

    At the beginning of the first meeting, the leaders of the Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory made a long speech, attempting to prove from all aspects that they were not unconcerned about the living welfare of the workers. However, after discussion and research at the meeting, the conclusion was that the factory's poor work in workers' living welfare was not the result of national regulations and systems, but rather that the factory's leaders had not properly studied and implemented these regulations and systems. The reason hindering the smooth progress of this criticism was not that the opinions of the Workers' Living Conditions Investigation Group were wrong (only individual figures were calculated imprecisely), but that the factory leaders lacked a correct attitude towards criticism. For example, this factory officially started production in September 1954. Although the workers' skills were already proficient, such as the first-grade cloth rate being 97.58% in the fourth quarter of 1954 and increasing to 99.8% in November 1955, the factory has been implementing a temporary transitional wage system that is 23% to 25% lower than the initially determined formal wage standard. The Ministry of Textile Industry had instructed the factory to adjust workers' wages in a timely manner, but they did not implement it. Not only that, but the wage funds allocated to the factory by the state according to the current wage standard also had a large amount of accumulation, with a total surplus of more than 100,000 yuan in 1954 and 1955. Another example is that the factory's leading staff members had objections to the criticism that the cafeteria was not well-run, because almost all of the factory's welfare expenses, which accounted for 2.5% of the total wages of the workers, were used to subsidize it; however, they did not see that in other factories in Beijing, the ratio of workers eating in the cafeteria to cooks was 50 to 1, while in this factory's cafeteria, it was 30 to 1.

    After two meetings, the relevant units all believed that the criticism from the Workers' Living Conditions Investigation Group was correct and was of great help to the work of the Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory and the relevant leading departments. The leading staff members of the Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory also initially expressed their acceptance of the criticism and their intention to improve the factory's workers' welfare work.

    We welcome this change in the Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory's attitude towards criticism; however, it is necessary to ask the factory's leading staff members to examine: Why did they adopt such an uncalm and resistant attitude towards criticism at the beginning? A comrade from the China Textile Trade Union mentioned at the meeting such a fact: Some factory leaders, because they saw that people often came to the factory for visits, and after the visits, they all praised the factory's achievements, came to the wrong conclusion that everyone who came to the factory was there to learn; therefore, they felt uncomfortable as soon as they heard criticism. This passage should attract the attention of the leaders of the Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory.

    本报读者来信部的调查报告
    中华全国总工会职工生活调查组苏克同志来信反映了北京国营第一棉纺织厂不关心职工生活福利的情况。在我们向北京国棉一厂核对事实的时候，厂方认为这个批评提到的不少情况同事实不符，有不少问题牵涉到上级规定的开支原则，不是厂里所能解决的；此外，他们还对职工生活调查组的工作提出了不少指责，认为这篇稿件在对证事实的过程中已经引起厂里工作人员思想上的混乱，如果发表出来将会使厂方陷于无法工作的状态。
    为了进一步核对事实，弄清是非，中华全国总工会就邀请中共北京市委员会、中国纺织工会、北京市工会联合会、中国纺织工会北京市委员会、纺织工业部等有关部门以及北京国棉一厂的党、行政和工会的领导人员等一起开会研究这个问题。
    在第一次会议开始的时候，北京国棉一厂的领导人员们作了很长的发言，企图从各方面来证明他们并不是不关心职工的生活福利。但是，经过会议讨论和研究的结果，这个厂职工生活福利工作做得不好，并不是国家的规定和制度的后果，而是厂里的领导人员没有很好学习和执行这些规定和制度。阻碍这个批评顺利开展的原因，并不是职工生活调查组的意见有错误（只有个别的数字计算得不够精确），而是厂里的领导人员缺乏正确对待批评的态度。例如，这个厂是1954年9月正式开工生产的，虽然工人们的技术早已熟练，如1954年第四季度正布率是97.58％，1955年11月就提高到99.8％；但是厂里一直到现在还实行着比初步确定的正式工资标准要低23％到25％的临时过渡工资制。纺织工业部曾经指示这个厂及时调整工人工资，但是他们并没有执行。不但如此，国家按照现在工资标准计划拨给厂里的工资基金也有着大量的积压，1954年和1955年共积余了10万元以上。又如，这个厂的领导工作人员对食堂办的不好的批评有意见，因为厂里的占工人工资总额2.5％的福利费几乎都贴到这上面去了；然而他们没有看到，北京市的其他工厂的食堂吃饭职工同炊事员之比是50比1，而在这个厂的食堂里却是30比1。
    经过两次会议，有关单位都认为职工生活调查组的批评是正确的，对北京国棉一厂和有关领导部门的工作都有很大帮助。北京国棉一厂的领导工作人员也初步表示接受批评，要改进厂里的职工福利工作。
    我们欢迎北京国棉一厂对待批评态度的这个转变；但是有必要请这个厂的领导工作人员检查一下：他们为什么在开始的时候对待批评采取了这样不冷静和抵触的态度呢？中国纺织工会的同志在会议上曾经说到这样一个事实：有些厂子的领导人，由于看到经常有人来厂参观，而且在参观以后都表扬厂里的成绩，就得出一个错误的结论，凡到厂里来的人都是来学习的；因此，他们一听到批评就感到不痛快了。这段话，应当引起北京国棉一厂领导人员的注意。
