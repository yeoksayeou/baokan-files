Fine Spinning Workers Learn Advanced Splicing Method
    Within the past month and a half, workers in the fine spinning workshop of the state-owned Northwest Second Cotton Textile Factory have all learned the advanced Soviet "untwisting splicing method," which has essentially eliminated the phenomenon of lumpy splices in cotton yarn. In the fine spinning workshop of the state-owned Northwest First Cotton Textile Factory, 361 workers have also learned the "untwisting splicing method." The female worker Zhang Xiuzhen is the most skilled operator, tending 1,200 spindles and splicing an average of 13 yarn ends per minute, with excellent quality. From February 1st to 24th, this textile factory achieved 87.84% for cotton yarn mixed standard grade, exceeding the national target. Many fine spinning workers at the Shaanxi First Cotton Textile Factory have also participated in learning this new splicing method since February. After worker Wu Zhanju switched to the "untwisting splicing method," the quality reached 100%.

    细纱工人学习先进接头法
    国营西北第二棉纺织厂细纱车间工人，在最近一个半月内都学会了苏联先进的“解拈接头法”，基本上消灭了棉纱接头有疙瘩的现象。国营西北第一棉纺织厂细纱车间，也有361个工人学会了“解拈接头法”。女工张秀珍操作得最熟练，她看1，200枚纱锭，平均每分钟接头13根，质量还很好。这个纺织厂2月份从1日到24日，棉纱混合标准品达到了87.84％，超过了国家规定的指标。陕西第一棉纺织厂的很多细纱工人也从2月份起参加了这种新接头法的学习，工人武占菊改用“解拈接头法”操作以后，质量达到100％。
