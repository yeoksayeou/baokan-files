    Why Have Accidents Increased?
    Kong Sang

    The number of safety accidents in industrial enterprises has increased again this year. The number of work-related injuries and deaths in Tianjin has greatly increased compared to the same period last year. In some enterprises in Fuxin, Benxi, Lüda, and Anshan in Liaoning Province, the number of accidents has also increased compared to the same period last year. This phenomenon deserves serious attention.

    Part of the reason for the increase in safety accidents is that some people have been carried away by the production upsurge, interpreting breaking unreasonable outdated rules as negating everything, failing to comply with technical operating procedures and safety regulations, resulting in accidents. However, the more important reason is that after the emerging industrial production upsurge, the enthusiasm of the workers has increased. The output of enterprises has increased, but the safety protection work of the enterprises has not been able to catch up quickly and correspondingly. For example, in the Sixth Workshop of Shenyang Water Pump Factory, after workers used the Kolesov and Kuzovkin advanced cutting methods, the leading personnel did not urge the timely installation of chip breakers, baffles, and other labor protection equipment, resulting in some people being cut by broken iron filings. After the Shanghai Joint State-Private Shun Chang Shipyard increased its production tasks, it transferred the blacksmith Gu Hongcai to do grinding wheel work, but did not provide him with the necessary safety operation education and technical education beforehand. Less than fifteen minutes after he started working, a grinding wheel explosion accident occurred. These facts show that to avoid accidents, we must overcome the erroneous idea of blindly breaking conventions and improve safety protection work in a timely and corresponding manner according to changes in equipment, technology, labor, and other conditions.

    In some enterprises, the occurrence of safety accidents is also directly related to illegal overtime work. The leading personnel of some enterprises tolerate some people using slogans such as "contributing work" and "voluntary labor" to encourage people to work illegal overtime. Individual enterprises even use overtime as the main means to complete the plan ahead of schedule. This is very wrong. The result of illegal overtime is not only the failure to complete the state plan ahead of schedule, but also the decline in product quality, damage to equipment, and an increase in personal accidents. As a result, the enthusiasm of workers will be frustrated, the production order will be disrupted, and the labor competition cannot be sustained. In order to ensure safe production and to enable the labor competition to continue to develop, we must oppose the phenomenon of illegal overtime. The leaders of enterprises must guide the soaring enthusiasm of the workers to learning and promoting advanced experience, improving technology, and improving management.

    事故为什么增多了
    孔桑
    工业企业的安全事故今年又多起来了。天津市因工伤亡的人数比去年同期大大增加了。辽宁省阜新、本溪、旅大、鞍山等市一些企业的事故次数，也都比去年同期多了。这种现象，是值得十分注意的。
    安全事故增多的一部分原因，是有些人被生产高潮冲昏了头脑，把打破不合理的陈规旧律理解为否定一切，不遵守技术操作规程和保安规程，以致造成事故。但是，更主要的原因是：正在形成中的工业生产高潮出现以后，职工群众的积极性提高了。企业的产量增加了，而企业的安全保护工作没能迅速地相应地赶上去。例如沈阳水泵厂第六车间，工人运用了科列索夫、库佐甫金先进切削法后，领导人员没有督促及时装置断屑器，挡板等劳动保护设备，结果就有人被破铁屑割伤。上海公私合营顺昌船舶修造厂，生产任务增加以后，把打铁工人顾宏才调去做砂轮生活，但是事先没对他进行必要的安全操作教育和技术教育，他工作了不到十五分钟就发生砂轮爆裂事故。这些事实说明，要避免事故，必须克服盲目打破常规的错误思想，及时地相应地根据设备、技术、劳动力等条件的改变，改进安全保护工作。
    在有些企业中，安全事故的发生也跟非法的加班加点有直接的联系。有些企业的领导人员容忍某些人以“献工”、“义务劳动”等口号来鼓动人们非法加班加点。个别企业甚至以加班加点的办法来作为提前完成计划的主要手段。这都是非常错误的。非法加班加点的结果，不仅不能提前完成国家计划，反而使产品质量下降，设备损坏，人身事故增加。其结果就会是工人的积极性遭受挫伤，生产秩序被打破，劳动竞赛不能持久。为了保证安全生产，为了使劳动竞赛持久地开展下去，我们必须反对非法的加班加点现象，企业的领导者必须把职工群众高涨的积极性，引导到学习和推广先进经验，提高技术，改善管理工作等正道上去。
