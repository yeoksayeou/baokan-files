    Strengthening the Party's leadership in science and culture, so that China's science and culture can rapidly overcome backwardness, catch up with the needs of socialist construction, and catch up with advanced international levels, is one of the Party's major tasks during the transition period. To achieve this goal, we must strengthen the Party's work among intellectuals. An important part of this work is to strengthen the Party's cultivation and education of intellectuals, and to develop a large number of Party members from among them, to influence and unite all intellectuals to march towards science and culture. Therefore, actively carrying out communist education among intellectuals and developing Party members has become an urgent problem to be solved.
    Many local Party organizations attach importance to recruiting Party members from among intellectuals. They pay close attention to developing Party members among intellectuals in schools at all levels, cultural, scientific, health agencies, and other fields. After the central government convened a meeting on intellectual problems, Party organizations across the country also began to pay attention to developing Party members among intellectuals, especially senior intellectuals. Many famous scientists, engineers, and university professors have joined the Party organization.
    However, many schools, agencies, organizations, factories, and mines have not yet carried out the work of developing Party members among intellectuals very well. Are there not many intellectuals in these schools, agencies, organizations, factories, and mines? No! Are the intellectuals in these schools, agencies, organizations, factories, and mines particularly backward, with no one applying to join the Party or meeting the requirements of a Party member? No! The main reason is that some Party members, especially responsible workers of Party organizations, still have conservative tendencies. This conservative tendency is currently mainly manifested in the views on specific issues of intellectuals. The heads of these Party organizations say that intellectuals have complex political experiences and social relationships, and cannot be accepted into the Party; they say that their bourgeois ideology is strong and they cannot yet be Party members.
    It cannot be denied that some intellectuals, especially senior intellectuals, do have relatively complex political experiences and social relationships because they come from landlord and bourgeois families. But this should not be a reason for not developing Party members among intellectuals. The political experiences and social relationships of most intellectuals are relatively simple, and can be quickly clarified after a certain investigation. Even for some intellectuals with more complex political experiences and social relationships, it is not impossible to investigate clearly. Before 1954, Tsinghua University in Beijing had more than 100 people whose political history problems could not be concluded for a long time; after two serious investigations and analyses in 1954 and 1955, conclusions were made. The experience of many places has proved that as long as a serious investigation and specific analysis are carried out, it will be found that although the political experiences and social relationships of many intellectuals are complex, they have always stood on the side of progress and adhered to the struggle against imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Although some intellectuals did not directly fight against imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, they also hated these reactionary forces. The very few who were actually used by imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries to carry out counter-revolutionary activities are extremely few.
    It is also true that some intellectuals have some more serious shortcomings in their ideology and work style, and do not yet meet the requirements of a Party member. But the problem is not whether these people have shortcomings, but what attitude we take towards people with shortcomings. Do we emphasize these people's shortcomings, look down on them, and not actively carry out the work of developing Party members among them? Or do we enthusiastically help them overcome their shortcomings and gradually raise them to the level of a Communist Party member? Facts have proved that as long as the Party organization earnestly educates intellectuals on how to be a Communist Party member, most people can quickly correct their shortcomings, and some can even improve to the standard of a Communist Party member. We should see this important situation: Chinese intellectuals are not only different from intellectuals in capitalist countries; but also after several years of cultivation and education by the Party, and after being tempered by successive social reform movements, a large number of intellectuals have undergone major changes. They support the Party and the People's Government, support socialism, are willing to serve the socialist cause, and are willing to learn Marxism-Leninism; many of them have already applied to join the Party. The public hospitals under the Jinan Municipal Health Bureau have a total of 47 senior intellectuals with the title of attending physician or above, of which 24 have applied to join the Party. Similar situations exist in other regions. This shows that there are more and more activists among intellectuals, and the conditions for developing Party members are getting better and better.
    Precisely because some Party members and Party organizations still have incorrect views on intellectuals, they do not adopt a positive attitude towards the work of developing Party members among intellectuals, but rather a passive attitude. They are unwilling to approach intellectuals, nor do they understand the ideological situation and work situation of intellectuals; when examining the work of intellectuals, they often fail to see the achievements and advantages in their work, but only see the shortcomings and mistakes in their work. They even regard the active work of a few intellectuals as "fake active" and "opportunistic." These erroneous understandings must be quickly and seriously criticized and corrected to ensure that the work of developing Party members among intellectuals is fully carried out.
    However, on the other hand, patient work must also be carried out in developing Party members among intellectuals, and the standards of Party members must be adhered to when accepting intellectuals into the Party. In some individual places, due to insufficient understanding of this aspect, the actual investigation of the political experience and class consciousness of individual applicants for Party membership has been neglected. In this way, it is easy to give counter-revolutionaries and speculators an opportunity to take advantage of. This is also worthy of our attention.
    In order to develop Party members among intellectuals, some Party organizations have also formulated plans for developing Party members among intellectuals when formulating work plans for intellectuals. This is good. But it is more important to take various practical and effective organizational measures to ensure the realization of this plan. For the work of developing Party members among senior intellectuals, the leading Party cadres of each unit should be organized to take practical responsibility, and these Party members should be required to frequently contact, understand and help the senior intellectuals in their own units; for senior intellectuals who have already applied to join the Party, they should be responsible for cultivating, educating and investigating them, and introducing those who meet the requirements of Party members into the Party. Experience has proved that this is a better method for developing Party members among senior intellectuals. For general intellectuals, the Party organization should also specifically assign Party members to conduct regular cultivation and investigation work. For places with weak Party work, such as primary and secondary schools, health care departments, and cultural and artistic groups, Party members should be dispatched or designated as often as possible to these places to carry out the work of developing Party members. Only by taking specific organizational measures according to different situations, timely checking the implementation of the plan, and summarizing and exchanging work experience can we ensure that the work of developing Party members among intellectuals is done well.

### 做好在知识分子中发展党员的工作

    做好在知识分子中发展党员的工作
    加强党对科学文化事业的领导，使我国的科学文化事业迅速地克服落后状态，赶上社会主义建设的需要，赶上国际的先进水平，是党在过渡时期的重大任务之一。为了达到这个目的，必须加强党在知识分子中的工作。其中的一项重要工作，就是加强党对知识分子的培养和教育，从他们中间发展大批的党员，通过他们去影响和团结全体知识分子向科学和文化进军。因此，积极地在知识分子中间进行共产主义的教育，进行发展党员的工作，已经成为一个亟待解决的问题了。
    对于在知识分子中发展党员，有很多地方的党组织是重视的。他们很注意在各级学校，文化、科学、卫生机关和其他方面的知识分子中进行发展党员的工作。在中央召开知识分子问题的会议以后，全国各地党组织，也都开始注意在知识分子中，特别是高级知识分子中发展党员。许多著名的科学家、工程师、大学教授都参加了党的组织。
    但是还有不少学校、机关、团体、厂矿在知识分子中发展党员的工作至今没有很好地开展起来。是不是这些学校、机关、团体、厂矿中的知识分子不多呢？不是！是不是这些学校、机关、团体、厂矿中的知识分子特别落后，没有人要求入党、也没有人具备党员条件呢？不是！这主要是在一部分党员特别是党组织的负责工作人员中，还存在保守倾向。这种保守倾向目前主要表现在对知识分子的具体问题的看法上，这些党组织的负责人说知识分子的政治经历和社会关系复杂，不能接收入党；说他们的资产阶级思想浓厚，还不能做一个党员。
    不能否认，的确有一部分知识分子特别是高级知识分子，因为出身于地主、资产阶级家庭，政治经历和社会关系都比较复杂。但是决不能因此就不在知识分子中进行发展党员的工作。大部分知识分子的政治经历和社会关系都比较简单，经过一定的调查，是很快可以弄清楚的。就是对于一部分政治经历和社会关系比较复杂的知识分子，也不是不能调查清楚的。北京清华大学在1954年以前，有一百多个人的政治历史问题长期得不出结论；经过1954年和1955年两次认真的调查和分析，都作出了结论。许多地方的经验都证明了，只要经过认真调查和具体分析，就会发现不少知识分子的政治经历和社会关系虽然复杂，但是一直是站在进步方面，坚持着对帝国主义、国民党反动派的斗争的，有些知识分子虽然没有直接对帝国主义、国民党反动派进行斗争，但也是痛恨这些反动势力的。而真正被帝国主义和国民党反动派利用来进行反革命活动的是极少数。
    也的确有一部分知识分子在思想作风上有一些比较严重的缺点，还没有具备党员条件。但是问题不在于这些人有没有缺点，而在于我们对有缺点的人采取什么态度，是强调这些人的缺点，看不起他们，不积极地在他们中间进行发展党员的工作呢？还是热情地帮助他们克服缺点，把他们逐步地提高到共产党员的水平呢？事实证明，只要党组织对知识分子认真进行怎样做一个共产党员的教育，绝大部分人就很快可以改正缺点，还有些人可以提高到做一个共产党员的标准。我们应该看到这样一个重要情况：中国的知识分子不仅不同于资本主义国家的知识分子；而且经过几年来党的培养和教育，历次社会改革运动的锻炼之后，有很大一部分知识分子已发生了重大变化。他们拥护党和人民政府、拥护社会主义，愿意为社会主义事业服务，愿意学习马克思列宁主义；他们中已有不少人提出了入党的请求。济南市卫生局所属的各公立医院中共有主治大夫以上高级知识分子四十七名，其中有二十四名已经申请入党。其他地区也有类似的情况。这说明知识分子中的积极分子愈来愈多，发展党员的条件愈来愈好了。
    正因为一部分党员和党组织对知识分子还有不正确的看法，所以他们对在知识分子中发展党员的工作不是采取积极态度，而是采取消极的态度。他们不愿和知识分子接近，也不了解知识分子的思想情况和工作情况；在检查知识分子的工作的时候，他们往往看不到人家工作中的成绩、优点，只看见人家工作的缺点、错误。他们甚至把少数知识分子的积极工作，看成是“假积极”“投机”。这些错误认识必须迅速地、严肃地加以批判和纠正，以保证在知识分子中发展党员的工作全面展开。
    但是另一方面，在知识分子中发展党员还必须进行耐心的工作，接收知识分子入党的时候，还必须坚持党员的标准。个别地方，由于对这方面认识不足，因而忽视了对个别申请入党者的政治经历和阶级觉悟程度的切实考察。这样，就容易给反革命分子和投机分子以可乘的机会。这也是值得我们注意的。
    为了在知识分子中发展党员，有些党组织在制定知识分子工作规划的时候，还拟定了在知识分子中发展党员的规划。这是好的。但是更重要的是采取各种切实有效的组织措施，来保证这一规划的实现。对于在高级知识分子中发展党员的工作，应该组织各单位的党员领导干部切实负责，应该要求这些党员同自己单位的高级知识分子经常地接触，了解和帮助他们；对于已经提出入党申请的高级知识分子，要负责培养、教育和考察，把其中具备党员条件的人介绍入党。经验证明：这是在高级知识分子中发展党员的一个比较好的方法。对于一般知识分子，党组织也应当具体分配党员去进行经常的培养和考察工作。对于中小学校、卫生保健部门、文化艺术团体等党的工作薄弱的地方，要尽可能地调派或者指定一些党员经常到这些地方进行发展党员的工作。只有根据不同情况，采取具体组织措施，及时检查计划的执行情况，总结和交流工作经验，才能保证把在知识分子中发展党员的工作做好。
