Key project of Baolan Railway, Xingxingwan Tunnel, Completed Ahead of Schedule

    The Xingxingwan Tunnel, a key project of the Baolan Railway, has been completed recently, 50 days ahead of schedule, after 10 months of intense construction day and night.

    The Xingxingwan Tunnel is more than 800 meters long, with complex geological changes and very hard rock. Some stones are difficult to drill through even with the best quality tungsten drill bits, and ordinary drill bits are worn out in less than 5 minutes. The workers promoted the Soviet water-cooled pneumatic drill, and finally overcame the hard rock. In the process of construction, the staff also promoted advanced experiences such as hollow blasting, gravel blasting, double-layer excavation method, and multi-head capping method, which greatly improved work efficiency.

    包兰铁路关键工程猩猩湾大隧道提前完工
    包兰铁路关键工程之一——猩猩湾大隧道，经过10个月来日夜紧张的施工，已经在最近提前50天完工。
    猩猩湾大隧道长达800多公尺，地质变化复杂，岩石很坚硬，有的石头用质量最好的钨钻头也很难钻进，一般的钻头不到5分钟就被磨光了。工人们推广了苏联水式风钻，终于战胜了坚石。在施工过程中，职工们还推广了放空心炮、石子炮以及双层开挖法、多头封顶法等先进经验，大大提高了工作效率。（本报驻兰州记者）
