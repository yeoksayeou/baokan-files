    "Dong Cunrui" is a good film that is both exciting and unforgettable.
    This is a biographical film based on a true story. If biographical films are not handled well, they often fall into these traps: either idealizing the protagonist, separating him from his typical environment, and turning him into a "superman," or rigidly adhering to the real events, reciting the protagonist's experiences in a flat, unselective manner. In this way, the protagonist loses his distinct personality and becomes a lifeless figure. The creation of "Dong Cunrui" is completely different. It breaks away from the aforementioned constraints that dim the light of art, and through novel artistic techniques, selects events of typical significance, successfully shaping the glorious image of the hero Dong Cunrui.
    The path Dong Cunrui took from an ordinary rural youth to a true soldier and an immortal hero was tortuous and complex. The film closely grasps every subtle process of Dong Cunrui's transformation from relative immaturity to gradual maturity. Through several typical events and vivid detailed descriptions, it vividly portrays how Dong Cunrui was tempered through the education of the Party and in the test of actual combat, and how he maintained and developed his excellent qualities.
    Before joining the revolution, Dong Cunrui only aspired to be a member of the Eighth Route Army, thinking of "guns and bullets, big fights, going south and north, traveling east and west, being glorious and respectable"; his understanding of the revolution was still relatively vague. However, from his refusal to admit defeat in wrestling matches with others, and from his repeated pestering of Zhao, the Eighth Route Army company commander, to join the army, it can be seen that this energetic young man had a stubborn streak. As long as he believed his desires were right, he would pursue them regardless of everything. There is the simplicity of a peasant, the innocence of a child, but more importantly, there is the indomitable spirit of a soldier.
    The film uses sharp conflicts to show Dong Cunrui's ideological progress step by step; and these many conflicts are closely linked to Dong Cunrui's distinct personality. After joining the army, Dong Cunrui was very excited. But when he discovered that everyone else's bullet pouches were full, while his only had ten bullets, he was furious. He even couldn't help but run out of the marching ranks to question the company commander. His comrades criticized him for not following discipline, but he was still unconvinced. Later, it was not until everyone in the squad took off their bullet pouches to show him during the squad meeting that he realized that everyone only had ten bullets, and the veteran comrades simply filled the pouches with sorghum stalks and small wooden sticks to deceive the enemy. This dramatic conflict not only highlights Dong Cunrui's straightforward and fiery personality but also shows the immaturity, lack of experience, and weak discipline of a new soldier from a peasant background. But these weaknesses do not affect our love for Dong Cunrui, because from this we can still see how frank and sincere Dong Cunrui is, how much he hates the enemy, and how eagerly he hopes to eliminate more enemies. This dramatic conflict is also cleverly arranged artistically. First, it reflects the true historical background of our army defeating a powerful enemy from a position of weakness during the Anti-Japanese War; at the same time, it foreshadows the next plot point: Dong Cunrui runs out of bullets in his first battle against the enemy without hitting the enemy. And when the squad of soldiers took off their bullet pouches, the truth was revealed, and the conflict was resolved, the film still did not relax its portrayal of the characters. At this time, Dong Cunrui sat down embarrassedly, looked at everyone suspiciously, and asked, "Fighting? Ten bullets are a bit few!" This further highlighted his strong personality and determination for revenge. All of this seems natural, without any trace of affectation.
    In his first battle against the enemy, Dong Cunrui only wanted to "fight the devils for pleasure and vent his anger," regardless of whether the bullets hit the enemy or not, and fired all the bullets given to him in one go. Dong Cunrui's erroneous behavior once again demonstrated his distinct personality; and through the criticism of his comrades, especially the company commander, Dong Cunrui's ideological progress took another step forward. The scene of the company commander talking to Dong Cunrui is very moving. The company commander's kind and sincere attitude, his concise and humane words, fully embodies the demeanor of a Party representative in the army, a leader in the company, and he is completely different from the leadership figures in some films who only make dull and uninteresting empty sermons. The company commander's words deeply touched Dong Cunrui's heart, from which he understood that as a true soldier, he cannot just rely on a "revolutionary spirit" to work hard; he must recognize the true meaning of "revolution," understand who he is fighting for, so that his "revolutionary spirit" can be sustained, and he can absolutely faithfully serve the people. Facts prove that after this, Dong Cunrui was no longer a young man who acted solely on enthusiasm, the proletariat's consciousness gradually grew in him, and he also tried his best to train himself into a communist soldier.
    The scene in the film where Dong Cunrui requests to join the Party has a strong comedic atmosphere. When Dong Cunrui sent the letter of request on behalf of the squad to the political instructor, he attached his Party membership dues. This shows Dong Cunrui's fervent desire to join the Party, and also demonstrates the further development of his revolutionary heroic qualities.
    The scene of electing the demolition squad leader in the film more clearly shows that Dong Cunrui's ideological quality has reached its peak. In order to open the gate of Chengde Longhua and quickly liberate the entire Rehe, our army elected the demolition squad leader, who was closely related to the overall battle situation, on the eve of the attack on Longhua. Dong Cunrui gloriously shouldered this mission. When Dong Cunrui selected his assistant, he chose Wang Haishan, who had competed with him for the position of demolition squad leader, to be the leader of the firepower team without any reservations. When Wang Haishan embraced Dong Cunrui with tears in his eyes, we clearly saw the spirit of unity and friendship among the comrades in the revolutionary ranks, and we also fully saw the formation of Dong Cunrui's higher communist qualities, his magnanimous mind, and his deep love for his comrades.
    Because the film meticulously and truthfully portrays Dong Cunrui's growth, the story of Dong Cunrui fearlessly holding a package of explosives to blow up the "bridge-shaped pillbox" and sacrificing heroically is more believable in artistic expression. When we saw the fuse of the explosives package in Dong Cunrui's hand burning over his head, we could fully understand Dong Cunrui's noble inner emotions. In order to defeat the enemy and win victory, Dong Cunrui was completely willing to sacrifice his young life. His heroic sacrifice is the most complete embodiment of the character of a revolutionary soldier tempered in battle at the crucial moment.
    The success of "Dong Cunrui" is inseparable from the concerted efforts of the director and actors. Director Guo Wei not only used clever artistic techniques to highlight the image of Dong Cunrui in the film, but also made better depictions of Dong Cunrui's comrades. Zhang Liang, the actor who played Dong Cunrui, has simple and meticulous acting skills, and he truthfully shaped the heroic image of Dong Cunrui. Yang Qitian, the actor who played Zhi Zhenbiao, Zhang Ying, the actor who played the company commander, and Zhou Diao, the actor who played the district party secretary, also have many unique aspects in their performances.
    The achievement of "Dong Cunrui" provides a brilliant example for our film creation on how to create positive characters and how to overcome the formulaic old ways. The film not only created the immortal image of the hero Dong Cunrui but also endowed it with profound typical significance in a broader typical environment of social reality. It makes us deeply feel that Dong Cunrui is not an unattainable mythical hero, but a vivid and kind partner, we can emulate him and learn from him. The film "Dong Cunrui" fully proves that only by writing about the character traits of heroic figures, writing about his gradual growth process, and portraying him truthfully and movingly, can we create the image of heroic figures with typical significance.

    英雄董存瑞的光辉形象
    ——谈国产故事片“董存瑞”——
    王若望
    编剧：丁洪、赵寰、董晓华　导演：郭维  长春电影制片厂出品
    “董存瑞”是使人激动、使人难忘的一部好影片。
    这是根据真人真事摄制成的传记片。传记片要是搞得不好，往往容易犯这样的毛病：不是使主人公理想化、使他离开了自己所处的典型环境，成为“超人”，就是拘泥于真人真事，不加选择地把主人公的经历平铺直叙地背诵一遍。这样，主人公就丧失了自己的鲜明的性格，成为一个干瘪的人物了。“董存瑞”的创作完全不是这样的。它摆脱了上述那些使艺术黯淡无光的桎梏，通过新颖的艺术手法，选取了具有典型意义的事件，成功地塑造出了英雄董存瑞的光辉形象。
    董存瑞由一个普通的农村青年成长为一个真正的战士，一个不朽的英雄人物，其间经过的道路是曲折而复杂的。影片紧紧地掌握住了董存瑞从比较幼稚到逐步成熟的每一个微细的过程，通过若干典型事件，通过生动的细节描写，把董存瑞在党的教育下，在实际的战斗考验里，怎样受到锻炼，怎样保持并发展了自己的优秀品质等情况生动地表现了出来。
    董存瑞在参加革命以前所向往于当八路军的，只不过是“枪炮子弹，大打大干，走南闯北，东游西转，又光荣又体面”；他对革命的认识还是比较模糊的。可是从他跟别人摔跤不服输，从他一再缠住八路军的赵连长要求参军等情况就可以看出，这个浑身是劲的小伙子是有着一股执拗劲的。他只要相信自己的愿望是对的，就会不顾一切地去追求它。这里面有着农民的质朴，孩子气的天真，但是更重要的却是有着作为一个战士的坚毅不拔的精神。
    影片通过尖锐的矛盾冲突，把董存瑞思想上一步步向前迈进表现了出来；而这许多矛盾冲突，又是和董存瑞的鲜明的个性紧密地结合起来的。参军以后，董存瑞很振奋。但是当他发现别人子弹袋里都装得满满的，自己的子弹袋里却只有十发子弹的时候，他火了。他甚至忍不住要从正在行进的行列里跑出来，去质问连长。同志们批评他不守纪律，他还不服气。后来直到在班的会议上，大家把子弹袋解下来给他看，他才知道原来大家都只有十发子弹，老同志们不过用高粱杆和小木棍将子弹袋塞满了哄骗敌人罢了。这一富有戏剧性的冲突，不仅突出了董存瑞的直率的、火爆的性格，也表现出了一个农民出身的新战士的幼稚、缺乏经验、纪律性不强等弱点。但是这些弱点并不影响我们对于董存瑞的热爱，因为从这里我们仍然可以看出，董存瑞是多么坦率、诚挚，他对敌人多么憎恨，他如何一心指望多消灭些敌人。这一富有戏剧性的冲突在艺术安排上也是很巧妙的。首先它反映出了抗日战争时期我军以弱势的地位战胜强大敌人的真实的历史背景；同时，它也给下一个情节：董存瑞在第一次对敌作战中打完了子弹却没有命中敌人，预先设下了伏线。而当全班战士解下了子弹袋，真相大白，矛盾解决了以后，影片仍然没有放松对人物性格的刻划。这时候董存瑞不好意思地坐了下来，怀疑地望着大家，问道：“打仗？十发子弹少点儿！”这就把他要强的性格和复仇的决心更加突出了。这一切看来都很自然，没有一点做作的痕迹。
    在第一次对敌作战中，董存瑞只图“打鬼子打个痛快解气”，不管出膛子弹是否命中了敌人，一口气就把发给他的子弹打光了。董存瑞这种错误的行为，再一次表现了他的鲜明的个性；而通过同志们特别是连长对他的批评，董存瑞思想上的进步又跨入一个新的阶段。连长跟董存瑞谈话这一场戏是很动人的。连长的亲切、真挚的态度，连长的简洁而富于人情味的话语，充分把一个部队中的党的代表者，一个连队里面的领导者的神态体现了出来，他和某些影片里面表现的只会作索然无味的空洞说教的领导人物是完全不同的。连长的谈话深深地打动了董存瑞的心，从中他理解到作为一个真正的战士，是不能光凭一股“革命劲”硬干的，他必须认识到“革命”的真正的意义，懂得自己在为谁作战，这样他的“革命劲”才能持久，他才能绝对忠实地为人民服务。事实证明，此后，董存瑞已经不是一个只凭一股热情行事的青年，无产阶级的自觉性已经在他身上逐渐增长，他也竭力要求把自己锻炼成一个共产主义的战士。
    影片里面表现董存瑞要求入党的这一情节，是带有强烈的喜剧气氛的。董存瑞在代表班向指导员送请战书的时候，附带交上了自己的党费。这说明了董存瑞要求入党的热烈的愿望，也表现了他的革命英雄主义的品质进一步的发展。
    影片中选举爆破队长一场戏，更明显地显示出董存瑞的思想品质已经发展到了最高峰。为了打开承德的大门隆化，迅速解放全热河，我军在进攻隆化的前夕选举了和整个战局有很大关系的爆破队长。董存瑞光荣地肩负起了这个使命。董存瑞在选拔自己的助手的时候，无所顾虑地把曾经跟他竞选过爆破队长的王海山选做火力组长。当王海山含着眼泪激动地和董存瑞拥抱的时候，我们清楚地看到了革命队伍里面同志们团结友爱的精神，我们也充分看出董存瑞的更高的共产主义品质的形成，他的气量宏大的胸怀，他对同志的深切的爱。
    由于影片把董存瑞的成长细致地、真实地表现了出来，最后董存瑞奋不顾身抱着炸药包去炸“桥型暗堡”而壮烈牺牲的事情在艺术表现上也就更加可信。当我们看到董存瑞拿着的炸药包的引线在他头上燃烧的时候，我们完全能够理解董存瑞的崇高的内心情绪。为了击溃敌人，为了赢得胜利，董存瑞是完全不惜牺牲他年青的生命的。他的壮烈牺牲，正是一个千锤百炼的革命战士性格在战斗的紧要关头最完满的体现。
    “董存瑞”的成就是和导演、演员的协同一致的努力分不开的。导演郭维不仅运用了巧妙的艺术手法突出了影片中董存瑞的形象，同时，对于董存瑞的战友们，也作了较好的描绘。扮演董存瑞的演员张良的演技是朴素的、细致的，他真实地塑造了董存瑞的英雄形象。扮演郅振标的演员杨启天，扮演连长的演员张莹和扮演区委书记的演员周雕，在表演上也有许多独特的地方。
      “董存瑞”的成就，给我们的电影创作提供了如何创造正面人物，如何克服公式化老一套的光辉的范例。影片不仅创造了英雄董存瑞的不朽形象，并且在更广阔的社会现实的典型环境里，赋与了它深刻的典型意义。它使我们深深地感觉到，董存瑞不是一个高不可攀的神话式的英雄，而是一个活生生的亲切的伙伴，我们可以效法他，学习他。影片“董存瑞”充分证明：只有写出了英雄人物的性格特征，写出了他逐步成长的过程，而且是真实感人地去刻划他，才能创造出具有典型意义的英雄人物的形象。
