Several Problems Seen in the Tong County Area
Wen Houhua, Dai Linfeng

Recently, we went to the Tong County area of Hebei Province to understand the preparations for spring plowing this year. We saw that the masses' enthusiasm for production was very high, the leadership's guidance on spring plowing preparation work was active and enthusiastic, the grassroots party organizations' leadership on spring plowing preparation work and the general political and ideological education of the commune members were very tightly grasped, and the spring plowing preparation work was also done with great achievements. For example, the Oriental Cooperative has accumulated twice as much fertilizer as last year and is now transporting it to the fields in a tense manner. When there were not enough carts and livestock, hand carts were used, and even people carried and lifted. Some young people did not rest until late at night. While accumulating fertilizer, 120 laborers were organized to work in shifts day and night to dig wells and repair weirs. Now, improved varieties have been selected, and the wheat fields have also been rolled once. However, we also discovered some urgent problems that need to be solved. If these problems are not resolved quickly, they will affect spring plowing production.

First, production plans urgently need to be determined and revised, so that production plans are established on a completely reliable basis and become the driving force for inspiring and consolidating the production enthusiasm of the masses and promoting the production movement. Tong County and many agricultural production cooperatives have production plans, but these plans were not formulated after practical investigation and research and full deliberation and discussion, but under the circumstances of blindly increasing production targets with only a surge of enthusiasm for increasing production. Last year, Tong County averaged 220 jin of grain per mu, but at the county-wide meeting of cooperative cadres and activists held by the County Party Committee in February, it was proposed to increase the average yield per mu to 750 jin this year, and it was also said that this target might be conservative, and everyone was asked to make suggestions for revision. Thus, challenges and responses to increase production were launched at the meeting. The director of the Oriental Cooperative proposed a target of 1,300 jin per mu, and the former Dongyi Township Cooperative even proposed a target of 1,800 jin per mu. Finally, the County Party Committee summarized and proposed that the county should achieve a target of "500 jin of cotton and 1,000 jin of grain" per mu. Some cadres and the masses did not have different opinions on such high targets, but they were afraid of being labeled as right-leaning conservatives and did not dare to express their opinions; or if they did, they did not dare to insist. This delayed the early determination of practical and feasible production plans and affected the better progress of spring plowing preparation work. Later, after the County Party Committee discovered this situation, it revised the county's production targets, changing the grain yield per mu to 320 jin and the cotton yield per mu to 150 jin. Some cooperatives have also revised their plans accordingly, such as the Oriental Cooperative, which has changed the grain yield per mu to 450 jin. However, the revised plan of the Oriental Cooperative had not been submitted to the commune members for discussion until the tenth of this month. Some individual cadres are still worried that telling the masses about the greatly reduced production targets will affect the masses' enthusiasm for production. They do not understand that only practical production plans can truly inspire the masses' enthusiasm for production, and they also do not understand that only by submitting them to the masses for discussion can the plans be more practical.

Second, the idea of "taking the cooperative as home" has not yet been established in the minds of many commune members. They still have varying degrees of doubt about whether the cooperative can increase production and increase income. Therefore, some commune members contribute land to the cooperative but not livestock, and some commune members contribute livestock but not fodder. Many commune members do not contribute fertilizer and seeds. The biggest problem at present is that many commune members do not invest in the cooperative, which has a great impact on spring plowing production. Since the Oriental Cooperative merged into a large cooperative of 1,700 households on February 8, no one had invested in the cooperative as of March 8. Is it because the commune members are having difficulties? Is it because they have no capital to invest? No. For example, Yang Qifa, an old upper-middle peasant commune member, has 200 yuan in cash, but he is afraid that the cooperative will ask him to invest, so he bought some unnecessary things. At the same time, some cooperative cadres have not realized that relying on the masses to raise funds is the fundamental way to solve the production difficulties of the cooperative, and they have the idea of trying to rely on government loans for assistance, so they do not conduct in-depth mobilization work among the masses.

Finally, the propaganda of the Prefectural Party Committee, the County Party Committee, the District Party Committee, and the Township General Branch on spring plowing production also seems weak and cannot keep up with the needs of the situation. At the end of February, the Propaganda Department of the Tong County Prefectural Committee convened a meeting of propaganda ministers of the County Party Committees. The meeting proposed that the content of the current propaganda and education work is: to carry out the ideological struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, to publicize the draft National Agricultural Development Program for 1956 to 1967, to systematically conduct education on the cooperative charter, and to conduct propaganda on spring plowing production. The propaganda work meeting, which was held when spring plowing production was about to begin, did not focus on the actual ideological situation of cadres and the masses in the spring plowing preparation work, and did not put forward specific tasks and requirements for propaganda work, which was inappropriate. The Propaganda Department of the County Party Committee also did not make special arrangements for the propaganda of spring plowing production. As for the Township General Branch, it only made general arrangements, did not immediately turn its propaganda work to spring plowing production, and did not organize and give play to the strength of the propaganda team. This relatively weakened the Party's propaganda and mobilization work and ideological education work among the masses on spring plowing production.

The above problems not only exist in the Tong County area, but also exist to varying degrees in other areas, according to our understanding. The spring plowing season is coming, and time is very pressing. Party organizations in various places should concentrate their efforts to remove obstacles that affect the development of spring plowing production, solve problems related to spring plowing production, and strengthen their leadership over spring plowing production.

    在通县地区看到的几个问题
    温厚华　戴临风
    最近，我们到河北省通县地区了解了一下今年春耕准备工作的情况。我们看到群众的生产积极性是十分高涨的，领导上对春耕生产准备工作的领导是积极热情的，基层党组织对春耕准备工作的领导和对社员一般的政治思想教育是抓得很紧的，春耕准备工作也是作得很有成绩的。比如东方合作社已积了比去年多两倍的肥料，现在正紧张地向地里运送，大车牲口不够使，就用手拉车，甚至人挑、人抬。有的青年一直送到深夜才歇工。与积肥同时还组织了120个劳动力昼夜不停地轮班打井、修水堰。现在优良品种已经选好，麦地也都压过一遍。但我们也发现了一些迫切需要解决的问题，如果这些问题不加以迅速解决，就会影响春耕生产。
    第一，生产计划亟需确定和修正，让生产计划建立在完全可靠的基础之上，成为启发和巩固群众的生产热情，推动生产运动的动力。通县全县和许多农业生产合作社都有生产计划，但这些计划不是经过切实的调查研究和充分的酝酿讨论之后制定的，而是在单凭一股增产热情盲目提高生产指标的情况下制定的。通县去年平均每亩产粮食220斤，而县委在二月间召开的全县社干部和积极分子的大会上一下就提出今年要把每亩平均产量提高到750斤，还说这个指标可能保守，要大家提意见再修正。这样就在会上展开了增产的挑战和应战，东方合作社的社长，提出亩产一千三百斤的指标，前东仪乡合作社更提出亩产一千八百斤的指标，最后县委总结时又提出全县要达到亩产“五百斤棉一千斤粮”的指标。有些干部和群众对这样高的指标并不是没有不同的意见，而是怕戴右倾保守的帽子，不敢提出意见；或者提出了也不敢坚持。这就延误了切实可行的生产计划的早日确定，影响了春耕生产准备工作更好的进行。后来，县委发现这种情况之后，已将全县生产指标作了修正，粮食亩产改为320斤，棉花亩产改为150斤。有的合作社也相应地修改了计划，如东方合作社已将粮食亩产改为450斤。但是东方合作社这个修改后的计划直到本月十日还未交给社员讨论。尚有个别干部担心把大大降低了的生产指标告诉群众，会影响群众的生产积极性。他们不懂得只有切合实际的生产计划才能真正启发群众的生产积极性，他们也不懂得，只有交给群众讨论，才能使计划更加切合实际。
    第二，不少社员“以社为家”的思想还没有树立，他们对合作社既能增加生产又能增加收入还抱着程度不等的疑虑。因此，有的社员土地入社牲畜不入社，有的社员入了牲畜不入草料，很多社员不入肥料种子。目前最大的问题是许多社员不向社里投资，对春耕生产影响很大。东方社从二月八日并成一千七百户的大社以后，至三月八日，还没有一个人向社里投资。是社员困难吗？是无资可投吗？不是。比如老上中农社员杨启发有现款二百元，怕社要他投资，竟买了一些并非必要的东西。同时，有些社干部也没有认识依靠群众筹集资金是解决合作社生产困难的根本方法，而存在着企图依赖政府贷款帮助的想法，因而也就不去向群众进行深入的发动工作。
    最后，地委、县委、区委和乡总支对春耕生产的宣传也显得薄弱，赶不上形势的需要。通县地委宣传部在二月底召开了县委宣传部长会议，会上提出目前宣传教育工作的内容是：开展社会主义和资本主义两条道路的思想斗争，宣传1956到1967年的全国农业发展纲要草案，系统地进行社章教育，以及进行春耕生产的宣传。在春耕生产即将开始的时候召开的宣传工作会议，没有着重针对春耕生产准备工作中干部和群众的实际思想情况，提出具体的宣传工作的任务和要求，这是不适当的。县委宣传部也对春耕生产的宣传没有作专门的部署。至于乡总支同样只是作一般的布置，没有把自己的宣传工作立即转到春耕生产方面来，没有很好组织和发挥宣传队伍的力量。这就相对地削弱了党在春耕生产上对群众的宣传鼓动工作和思想教育工作。
    以上这些问题，不仅在通县地区存在着，据了解，在其他地区也程度不等地存在着。春耕季节就要到来，时间已经十分紧迫。各地党组织应该集中力量扫除影响开展春耕生产的障碍，解决有关春耕生产的问题，加强对春耕生产的领导。
