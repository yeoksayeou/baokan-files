A Good Way to Improve Together
    Kong Sang
    In the Shanghai China Textile Machinery Factory, a widespread mutual teaching and learning activity was launched in the production upsurge to strive for early completion of the Five-Year Plan. In order to meet the needs of the workers and to improve together, the trade union organization focused on the foundry workshop, which had more new workers and workers with poor skills. It formed 19 "teaching and learning groups" with 42 new, old, and less skilled workers according to their job nature. Each veteran worker was assigned to help one or two new workers or workers with poor skills, and technical personnel were organized to provide technical guidance to each group. This approach was warmly welcomed by the workers. Every day after work or during meal breaks, the new workers and less skilled workers in each group gathered together to listen to the veteran workers explain the key points of operation and watch the veteran workers demonstrate the operation. Usually, when the veteran workers were working, the new workers and less skilled workers stood by and observed, helping with some auxiliary work. After the veteran workers completed their daily quota, they used the extra time to allow the new workers and less skilled workers to operate independently, with the veteran workers providing guidance from the side.
    After the "teaching and learning group" activities were launched enthusiastically, the trade union organization struck while the iron was hot, learning from the experience of State-owned Cotton Factory No. 4 and organizing new workers and less skilled workers to carry out a "graduation competition," with those who could reach the daily planned quota being considered qualified, and those who exceeded the quota by 3% being considered "graduated." This further encouraged the enthusiasm of the new workers to learn technology. Veteran workers took pride in helping new and less skilled workers "graduate" in the shortest possible time, while new and less skilled workers took pride in "graduating" in the shortest possible time. Many workers learned humbly, so they mastered operating skills in a very short time, going from failing to complete the quota to exceeding the quota. Now, the assembly, machine work, and carpentry workshops of this factory have all organized mutual teaching and learning groups based on the experience of the foundry workshop.
    The uneven technical level of workers and the good and bad performance in completing plans are phenomena that will exist in any factory or mine at any time. The responsibility of enterprise leaders is to use all means to raise the technical level of workers with low skills to the level of workers with high skills, thereby continuously improving the production level of the entire enterprise. To achieve this goal, the Party, administrative, and trade union organizations of enterprises must not only educate technically skilled workers to help technically unskilled workers from an ideological perspective, educate technically unskilled workers to humbly learn from technically skilled workers, and promptly reward and commend those who actively help others improve their skills or actively catch up with the advanced, but also must do a lot of specific organizational work. Such as organizing training classes for advanced technology and advanced experience, organizing roving performances by advanced workers, and so on. The organization of "teaching and learning groups" by the Shanghai China Textile Machinery Factory is also a good method. Because this method allows those who are willing to learn and improve to find teachers, and allows those who are willing to help others to find students. This method can also improve the sense of responsibility of those in charge of teaching, thereby facilitating the raising of technically inferior people to an advanced level in the shortest possible time. With the arrival of the production upsurge to strive for the early completion of the first Five-Year Plan, in various industrial and mining enterprises, more and more advanced workers will be willing to help others improve their skills, and more and more people will be willing to learn from the advanced and strive to catch up with the advanced. The Party organizations, administrative departments, and trade union organizations of enterprises must, like the trade union of the Shanghai China Textile Machinery Factory, quickly take appropriate organizational measures to ensure that employees realize their noble wish for "common improvement."

    共同提高的一个好办法
    孔桑
    上海中国纺织机械厂职工，在争取提前完成五年计划的生产热潮中，广泛开展了互教互学活动。工会组织为了满足职工群众的这种要求，以便共同提高，便以新工人和技术较差的工人较多的铸工车间为重点，把42个新的、老的和技术较差的工人按照工作性质，组成19个包教保学小组，由每一个老工人固定帮助一、二个新工人或技术较差的工人，同时组织技术人员分工到各个组里去进行技术指导。这个办法受到工人的热烈欢迎。每到下班或饭后休息时间，各小组的新工人们和技术较差的工人们，都聚集在一起，听老工人讲解操作要点，看老工人表演操作。平常，老工人干活的时候，新工人和技术较差的工人站在旁边观摩，帮助做一些辅助工作；老工人完成了当天定额以后，就利用多余时间让新工人和技术较差的工人单独操作，自己从旁指导。
    包教保学小组活动热烈开展以后，工会组织更趁热打铁，学习国棉四厂经验，组织新工人和技术较差的工人开展“毕业竞赛”，以能达到当天计划定额的为合格，超过定额3％的就算“毕业”。这就更加鼓舞了新工人学习技术的积极性。老工人也以在最短的时间内帮助新工人、技术较差的工人“毕业”为光荣，新工人、技术较差的工人则以在最短的时间内“毕业”为光荣。不少工人都虚心学习，所以在极短时间内掌握了操作技术，从完不成定额到超过定额。现在，这个厂的装配、机工、木工车间，都已经根据铸工车间的经验，普遍组织了互教互学小组。
    工人技术水平参差不齐，完成计划的情况有好有坏，是任何工厂、矿山在任何时候都会存在的现象。企业领导的责任就是用一切办法来把技术低的工人提高到技术高的工人的水平上来，从而不断地提高整个企业的生产水平。为了达到这个目的，企业的党、行政和工会组织，除了从思想方面教育技术高的工人帮助技术低的工人，教育技术低的工人虚心向技术高的工人学习，以及及时地奖励和表扬那些积极帮助别人提高技术，或者积极赶上先进的人们以外，还必须做许多具体的组织工作。如组织先进技术、先进经验的训练班，组织先进工人巡回表演等等。上海中国纺织机械厂组织包教保学小组也是一个很好的办法。因为这个办法，可以使那些愿意学习，愿意提高的人找到老师，使那些愿意帮助别人的人找到学生。这个办法还可以提高负责教的人的责任心，从而便于在最短的时间内把技术较差的人提高到先进的水平上来。随着争取提前完成第一个五年计划的生产热潮的到来，在各个工矿企业里，愿意帮助别人提高技术的先进工人们，和愿意向先进学习，努力赶上先进的人们将越来越多。企业的党组织、行政和工会组织，必须像上海中国纺织机械厂工会一样，迅速采取适当的组织措施，保证职工们实现“共同提高”的崇高愿望。
