    How the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Inner Mongolia Solved the Problem of Livestock Joining the Cooperative
    By our reporter Lin Mo
    In many places in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, with the progress of agricultural cooperativization, farmers are actively demanding the cooperativization of individual, scattered livestock farming. At the same time, some places lack winter and spring forage. Some strong draught animals have been absorbed by agricultural production cooperatives, and the feeding problem of the remaining scattered livestock, breeding stock, and young livestock needs to be solved by the cooperative in a unified way. Even in places where forage is not lacking, farmers feel that they are too busy participating in production in the cooperative and taking care of livestock at home, and livestock farming needs to be managed by the cooperative in a unified manner.
    Recently, the Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Second District of Urad Front Banner smoothly solved the problem of collectivizing animal husbandry by adopting the method of valuing livestock and incorporating them into the cooperative and reasonably allocating the public ownership share fund.
    The Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative was transformed into a higher-level cooperative in December 1955. The cooperative has 421 households. In addition to the cooperative's 349 public draught animals, the members privately own a total of 4,126 livestock, including 2,938 sheep, 893 cattle, 39 horses, 252 donkeys, and 4 mules.
    Regarding the collective management of members' private livestock, the cooperative management committee initially introduced three methods to the members: (1) The livestock remains privately owned by the members, and the cooperative sends people to graze them uniformly, with the livestock owners paying grazing fees; (2) The livestock is used as shares and managed collectively by the cooperative, with income distributed according to labor and livestock shares in a certain proportion; (3) The livestock is valued and incorporated into the cooperative, becoming collectively owned. Among the three methods, the cooperative's leaders believed that the second method was more appropriate, as it could solve the problem of unified management and take into account the members' private ownership concept of livestock. Therefore, the second method was emphasized during the publicity.
    After publicity and deliberation in various member groups, everyone unanimously opposed the first method, believing that it was not much better than privately hiring shepherds to graze livestock. Initially, a few people agreed with the second method, but the vast majority were willing to implement the third method, requesting that the livestock be valued and incorporated into the cooperative. They believed that incorporating livestock into the cooperative at a price would not disadvantage individuals; livestock would be transferred from small families to a large family, and they would still have a share. In agriculture, everyone has deeply realized the benefits of cooperativization; in animal husbandry, everyone also believes that collective is stronger than individual farming. Therefore, the voice of the vast majority of members is: Now, if we implement the method of share dividends, it will still be collectivized after a year or two. To transition to socialism, if there is a direct road to take, there is no need to take a detour. After a few days of deliberation and discussion, most of those who originally supported the second method also changed their minds.
    After the members' opinions on valuing livestock and incorporating it into the cooperative were reported, the management committee initially did not approve it. Yu Zhanhai, the director of the cooperative, also had great concerns: he had no experience in animal husbandry cooperativization, and there were no clear instructions from higher authorities. He was afraid of making mistakes if he did not do well. Furthermore, with so many livestock in the cooperative, valuing and incorporating them would cost a lot of money. Could the cooperative bear such a large debt? However, most of the group leaders, team leaders, and some members of the management committee disagreed with this view. They said: As long as all of our members are united and work hard, any difficulties can be overcome! What we are doing is beneficial to the members and the country, so what mistakes can we make? Some even said: "We are taking the road of socialism, and if we can take big strides and move faster, there is no need to put on airs and take small steps."
    The two sides argued for a long time, and it was difficult to reach a consensus.
    Later, the comrades of the work team suggested that it might be a good idea to calculate a detailed account according to the method of valuing livestock and incorporating it into the cooperative to get a clear picture of the situation and see how big the problem really was. The calculation showed that the more than 4,000 livestock, large and small, were worth more than 60,000 yuan. Everyone further studied: If 80% of the livestock-owning households in the cooperative all shared a portion of the public ownership share fund, at 20 yuan per male member and 15 yuan per female member, then a total of more than 16,000 yuan could be shared; the remaining 20% of poor households without livestock's share funds could be solved with loans from the cooperative's poor peasant fund issued by the government. In this way, the pastoral collectivization share fund for all members could be allocated more than 20,000 yuan. The remaining 40,000 yuan needs to be repaid in installments. The Xianfeng Cooperative is a large cooperative with more than 400 households, and it is estimated that in 1956 it can earn more than 18,000 yuan in public accumulation funds (the cooperative stipulates that the annual public accumulation fund is 7% of the total income). The more than 4,000 livestock valued and incorporated into the cooperative can generate more than 12,000 yuan in income from young livestock, wool, and dairy products in one year (no pastoral income will be distributed in the first year), for a total of 30,000 yuan. In this way, if 50% of the livestock payment is repaid in the first year and 25% is repaid in each of the second and third years, it can be completely achieved.
    After this detailed calculation and research, the cooperative's leaders began to have confidence and courage. But then they considered whether the masses' socialist consciousness and requirements for the collectivization of animal husbandry that everyone was reflecting were false? Were they sincerely willing? Therefore, the cooperative's leaders, Party and League members, and activists went deep into each group and household to publicize the researched methods and deeply understand the ideological situation. As a result, the vast majority of members agreed to the method of valuing livestock and incorporating them into the cooperative, repaying in installments, and allocating public ownership share funds. Of the 421 households in the cooperative, only 5 households were unwilling or not completely willing to do so. Their situations were different: For example, member Gao Si had a mare and more than 10 sheep. Because the mare could produce a mule foal every year, he was unwilling to incorporate it, but he was willing to incorporate the sheep into the cooperative. Member Wang Cai had 150 sheep and 4 cattle. Because his family had a half-labor force that could graze the sheep himself, he was only willing to incorporate the cattle into the cooperative. Member Yang Jibao had 4 cattle and 20 sheep. He felt that he could solve the problem of clothing every year by selling wool and calves, and he could also slaughter sheep for food in the autumn. Therefore, he was unwilling to incorporate the cattle and sheep. The other two households were also unwilling to join the cooperative due to similar situations. Everyone believed that: 5 households are not a big problem, and we cannot let them hold us back. In this way, except for these 5 households, all the livestock was valued and incorporated into the cooperative.
    When valuing the livestock and incorporating them into the cooperative, appropriate consideration was also given to all aspects according to the needs of the members' lives: those who wanted to drink milk could keep one or two dairy cows for their own use; horses or donkeys that were frequently ridden were also kept and not incorporated; if members wanted to slaughter sheep for food during the New Year or festivals, they could request an appropriate advance payment from the cooperative. As a result of this handling, basically everyone was satisfied.

    内蒙古先锋农业合作社是怎样解决牲畜入社问题的
    本报记者  林沫
    内蒙古自治区许多地方的农民，随着农业合作化的进展，积极地要求把个体、分散经营的畜牧业合作化。同时，有些地方冬、春草料缺乏，一部分强壮的耕畜由农业生产合作社吸收了，剩下一部分散畜、母畜和幼畜的饲养问题，也需由合作社统一设法解决。即使不缺乏草料的地方，农民也感到在社里参加生产和在家照顾牲畜两头忙不过来，须要由合作社统一经营畜牧业。
    最近，乌拉特前旗二区先锋农业生产合作社，采取牲畜作价归社和合理分摊公有化股份金的办法，顺利地解决了畜牧业公有化的问题。
    先锋农业生产合作社是1955年12月转为高级社的。全社421户，除社的公有耕畜349头外，社员私有牲畜共4，126头，其中羊2，938只、牛893头、马39匹、驴252头、骡4头。
    对社员私有牲畜的集体经营问题，最初社务管理委员会向社员介绍了三种办法：（一）牲畜仍归社员私有，由社里出人统一放牧，畜主出放牧费；（二）牲畜入股，由社集体经营，收入归劳动和畜股按一定比例分配；（三）牲畜作价归社，成为集体所有。三种办法中，社的领导人员认为第二种办法较适当，既可解决统一经营问题，又照顾了社员对牲畜的私有观念。所以宣传时也着重介绍了第二种办法。
    宣传后经过各社员小组酝酿讨论，大家一致反对第一种办法，认为那样比私人合伙雇牧工放牲畜好不了多少。开始也有少数人赞成第二种办法，但是绝大多数人都愿意实行第三种办法，要求把牲畜作价归社。他们认为：牲畜作价归社，个人不吃亏；牲畜由小家庭转到大家庭，也还有自己一份。在农业上，大家已经深深体会到合作化的好处；在牧业上，大家也相信集体比单干强。因此，绝大多数社员的呼声是：现在实行入股分红的办法，闹上一、二年还是要集体化；过渡到社会主义，明明有直路可走，就不必再绕弯路了。经过几天的酝酿讨论，原来赞成第二种办法的，也大都改变了自己的意见。
    社员们要求牲畜作价归社的意见反映上去之后，管理委员会就首先通不过。社主任余占海也有很大顾虑：自己对牧业合作化还没有经验，上级也没有明确的指示，怕搞不好会犯错误；再说，全社这么多牲畜，作价归社要很多钱，社里能背起这样大的债吗？但是大多数组长、队长和一部分社务委员不同意这种看法，他们说：只要咱们全体社员一条心，积极肯干，有什么困难都可以想办法克服！咱们这么办，对社员、对国家都有好处，还会犯什么错误？有的还说：“咱们走社会主义的路，明明能迈大步走快些，就不必摆着架势迈方步了。”
    双方争论了很久，意见很难一致。
    后来，工作组的同志提出，不妨按作价归社的办法算个细账摸摸底，看问题究竟有多大。计算的结果，大小4，000多头牲畜，共值6万多元。大家进一步研究：如果全社80％的有畜户都分摊一部分公有化股份基金，按每个男社员摊20元、女社员摊15元，这样总共可以摊16，000多元；剩下20％没有牲畜的贫困户的股份金，可以用政府发放的合作化贫农基金贷款中来解决。这样，全体社员的牧业公有化股份金就可以摊2万多元。其余4万元需要分期还款。先锋社是一个400多户的大社，预计1956年就可以收入公积金（该社规定每年公积金为总收入的7％）18，000多元，作价归社的4，000多头牲畜，一年所出产的幼畜、羊毛、奶食品等可收入12，000多元（第一年不分配牧业收入），两项收入共3万元。这样，若第一年还牲畜款50％，第二、三年各还25％，完全可以作到。
    经过这样算细账、摸底研究，社的领导人员开始有了信心和胆量。但又考虑到，大家所反应的群众的社会主义觉悟和对畜牧业公有化的要求，是否有虚假现象？是否真心愿意？因此，社的领导人员、党、团员和积极分子，又深入到各组、各户，一面宣传所研究的办法，一面深入了解思想情况。结果，绝大多数社员都同意作价归社、分期还款和分摊公有化股份金的办法。全社421户中，只有5户不愿意或不完全愿意这样办。他们的情况各有不同：如社员高四，有一匹骒马和10多只羊。因为马能每年下个骡驹子，不愿入，却愿意把羊入社。社员王才，有150只羊、4头牛，因为家有一个半劳动力可以自己放羊，只愿把牛入社。社员杨继宝，有4头牛、20只羊。他觉得自己每年可以靠卖羊毛、牛犊的收入，解决穿衣问题，到秋天还可以杀羊吃，因此，牛、羊都不愿入。其他两户也因为类似情况不愿入社。大家都认为：5户人不算大问题，不能让他们扯住咱的后腿。这样，除了这5户人以外，都把牲畜作价归社了。
    在牲畜作价归社的时候，还根据社员生活的需要，对各方面作了适当的照顾：要吃牛奶的，可以自留一至二头乳牛；经常骑用的马或毛驴，也留下不入；社员过年、过节要杀羊吃，可向社里酌量预支。这样处理的结果，基本上做到了家家满意。
