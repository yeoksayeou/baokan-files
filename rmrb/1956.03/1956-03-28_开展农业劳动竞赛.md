    Launch Agricultural Labor Emulation Campaigns
    After the great victory of the agricultural cooperation movement, the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers across the country is unprecedentedly high. They are actively and enthusiastically participating in the socialist labor emulation campaigns among agricultural producers' cooperatives, between cooperatives, between production teams, and between groups. This is a new sign of the growing development of agricultural production in our country.
    With the development of agricultural cooperation, actively leading farmers in launching socialist labor emulation campaigns on the agricultural production front, improving agricultural labor productivity, and ensuring the early and overfulfillment of production plans, is also a very important task for local Party committees and governments at present.
    The key to broadly and deeply launching labor emulation campaigns in agricultural production lies in strengthening the regular and specific leadership of labor emulation. When leading agricultural producers' cooperatives to carry out labor emulation, it is necessary not only to propose clear goals for improving labor productivity and fulfilling the state's agricultural production plan, but also to propose specific content for the emulation based on agricultural seasons and work segments. In order to strengthen the leadership of labor emulation, organizing labor emulation between cooperatives in a county's districts and townships, as well as labor emulation between teams, groups, and individual members within cooperatives, should become the main form of labor emulation at present.
    After the labor emulation campaign is launched, leading staff members of Party committees, government organs, and agricultural producers' cooperatives at all levels must promote the healthy development of the campaign through regular and meticulous ideological and organizational work. To this end, it is necessary to closely integrate the requirements of production with the ideological conditions of the masses, carry out vivid and specific propaganda and mobilization, and constantly solve the ideological problems arising in the process of the campaign; frequently use forms such as seminars, visits, exhibitions, etc., to exchange and promote advanced experiences; carry out criticism and self-criticism, encourage the advanced to lead the backward, and promote the backward to learn from the advanced. At the end of each agricultural season and work segment, timely evaluations and summaries should be conducted, the results of the campaign should be announced in a timely manner, and advanced units and individuals who have made significant achievements in production and work should be rewarded. Last year, the Hongguang Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Xiaguihua Township, Licheng County, Shanxi Province, in the process of carrying out the campaign, continuously carried out criticism and self-criticism in response to the ideological conditions of the masses at each stage, mobilized members to supervise and inspect each other during operations, and conducted monthly evaluations and quarterly awards. This kind of led, year-round labor emulation helped the Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative overcome drought, achieve a bumper harvest, and greatly increase the labor enthusiasm of all male and female members of the cooperative. Taking the utilization rate of the cooperative's female labor force as an example, it increased by 40% in 1955 compared to 1954. In this year's spring plowing work, the cooperative has launched a labor emulation campaign centered on well-digging, manure accumulation, and soil improvement, and the entire cooperative has completed the spring plowing plan ahead of schedule and above target.
    Leading agricultural producers' cooperatives to carry out labor emulation must be combined with improving the cooperative's operation and management. If the cooperative has not established a rational labor organization, labor discipline, and responsibility system, and has not formulated advanced and reliable production plans and labor plans, the labor emulation will have no foundation, the labor enthusiasm of the masses of farmers cannot be fully utilized, and it is easy to cause phenomena such as competition for work, idling, simply pursuing the quantity of work while ignoring quality, and ignoring the safety of people and animals. In the manure accumulation competition of Xiaobeiwang Township Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Yongnian County, Hebei Province, due to the lack of specific production plans and labor plans, "after finishing this job, the next job could not be continued," and the labor emulation campaign could not proceed normally; later, after the production plan and labor plan were formulated, the emulation campaign proceeded normally. Of course, we must never wait until the cooperative's operation and management system is perfect before launching labor emulation, but rather continuously strengthen the planning of production work and continuously improve labor management and financial management in the process of labor emulation.
    In the process of leading farmers to carry out socialist labor emulation, attention must be paid to preventing the formalism and championship-ism tendencies that may occur. In the past few years, agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid groups in various places have also carried out labor emulation, which has played a certain role in promoting agricultural production. However, labor emulation in many places has also experienced formalism and championship-ism tendencies: some areas' labor emulation campaigns have had a beginning but no end: the competition began with a bang, and after a period of excitement, the competition stopped, and no one cared about it anymore. Some are "hot at both ends, cold in the middle," that is: spring plowing arrangements for competition, autumn harvest awards for models; but there was no inspection, no evaluation and summary in the middle of the competition process, so that some of the models evaluated were fake models with falsely reported results. This is not the kind of competition we need. The competition we need is a labor emulation campaign with clear goals, specific content, a beginning and an end, and consistent implementation. Only such a labor emulation campaign can give full play to the labor enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of farmers, improve labor productivity, and ensure the completion of the state's agricultural production plan.
    The Party and League organizations in rural areas should give full play to the leading and backbone role of Party members and League members in labor emulation. The broad masses of rural youth should actively participate in labor emulation, become shock forces in agricultural production, and take the lead in learning, adopting, and promoting new technologies and advanced experiences. This year's agricultural production tasks in various places have increased unprecedentedly, and many cooperatives have experienced a shortage of labor. It is necessary to mobilize more women to participate in production through competition.
    This year's agricultural production increase target in our country is higher than any previous year, and comprehensively achieving this increase target is an extremely arduous task. However, as long as we are good at relying on the strength of cooperatives, deeply leading labor emulation, and organizing the broad masses of farmers into a powerful production army, we can overcome various difficulties and achieve major victories in agricultural production.

### 开展农业劳动竞赛

    开展农业劳动竞赛
    在农业合作化运动取得伟大胜利以后，全国各地广大农民的劳动热情空前高涨。他们积极地热烈地参加了当地农业生产合作社社和社之间、生产队和生产队之间、组和组之间的社会主义劳动竞赛。这是我国农业生产日益发展的一个新的标志。
    随着农业合作化的发展，积极地领导农民在农业生产战线上开展社会主义劳动竞赛，提高农业劳动生产率，保证提前和超额完成生产计划，也是各地党委和政府当前的一项十分重要的任务。
    在农业生产中广泛地深入地开展劳动竞赛的关键，在于加强劳动竞赛的经常的和具体的领导。在领导农业生产合作社开展劳动竞赛的时候，不仅要提出提高劳动生产率、完成国家农业生产计划的明确的目标，而且要根据农事季节、工作段落提出具体的竞赛内容。为了加强劳动竞赛的领导工作，组织一个县的各区、乡的合作社之间的劳动竞赛，以及合作社内各队、各组和各个社员之间的劳动竞赛，应该成为目前劳动竞赛的主要形式。
    在劳动竞赛开展起来以后，各级党委、政府机关和农业生产合作社的领导工作人员，必须通过经常性的细致的思想工作和组织工作，推动竞赛健康地向前发展。为此就要密切结合生产的要求和群众的思想情况，进行生动具体的宣传鼓动，不断地解决竞赛过程中产生的思想问题；经常运用座谈、参观、访问、展览等形式，交流和推广先进经验；开展批评和自我批评，鼓励先进的带动落后的，推动落后的向先进的看齐。在每个农事季节和工作段落结束的时候，要及时进行评比、总结，及时公布竞赛的结果，奖励在生产上和工作上有显著成绩的先进单位和个人。山西黎城县下桂花乡虹光农业生产合作社去年在开展竞赛的过程中，针对每个阶段群众的思想情况，不断地开展批评和自我批评，发动社员在作业中互相督促检查，按月评比，按季评奖。这种有领导的常年的劳动竞赛，帮助虹光农业合作社战胜了旱灾，取得了丰收，大大地提高了全社男女社员的劳动积极性，以全社妇女劳动力的利用率为例，1955年比1954年提高了40％。在今年的备耕工作中，这个合作社又开展了以打井、积肥和改良土壤等为中心内容的劳动竞赛，全社已经提前和超额完成了备耕计划。
    领导农业生产合作社开展劳动竞赛，必须同改善合作社的经营管理相结合。合作社如果没有建立合理的劳动组织、劳动纪律和责任制度，没有定出先进而可靠的生产计划和劳动计划，劳动竞赛就没有基础，农民群众的劳动热情就不能充分发挥出来，也就容易造成争工窝工、单纯追求作业数量而忽视质量和忽视人、畜安全的现象。河北省永年县小北汪乡农业生产合作社在积肥竞赛中，由于没有具体的生产计划和劳动计划，以致“作完这件活，续不上那件活”，劳动竞赛无法正常进行；后来制定了生产计划和劳动计划，竞赛运动才正常地开展起来。当然，决不能等待合作社的经营管理制度完备无缺以后才开展劳动竞赛，而是应当在劳动竞赛过程中，不断地加强生产工作的计划性，不断地改进劳动管理和财务管理。
    在领导农民开展社会主义劳动竞赛的过程中，必须注意防止可能发生的形式主义和锦标主义的偏向。过去几年，各地的农业生产合作社和互助组也曾经开展过劳动竞赛，对于农业增产起了一定的推动作用。但是，也有不少地方的劳动竞赛曾经发生过形式主义和锦标主义的偏向：有些地区的劳动竞赛有头无尾：竞赛开始，轰动一时，一阵热闹过后，竞赛就停顿下来，再没有人去过问了。有的是“两头热，中间冷”，这就是：春耕布置竞赛，秋收评奖模范；但在竞赛过程中间却没有检查，没有评比总结，以致评出来的模范，有一些是虚报成绩的假模范。这就不是我们所需要的竞赛。我们所需要的竞赛是目标明确、内容具体、有头有尾、贯彻始终的劳动竞赛。只有这样的劳动竞赛，才能发挥广大农民群众的劳动积极性和创造性，提高劳动生产率，保证完成国家农业生产计划。
    农村的党和团的组织应该充分发挥党员、团员在劳动竞赛中的带头作用和骨干作用。广大的农村青年应该积极参加劳动竞赛，成为农业生产中的突击力量，带头学习、采用并推广新技术和先进经验。今年各地的农业生产任务空前增大，许多合作社出现了劳动力不足的情况，必须通过竞赛，发动更多妇女参加生产。
    我国今年的农业增产指标比过去任何一年都要高，全面地实现这个增产指标，是一个极其艰巨的任务。但是，我们只要善于依靠合作社的力量，深入地领导劳动竞赛，把广大农民组成一支强大的生产大军，就可能排除各种困难，在农业生产上取得重大胜利。
