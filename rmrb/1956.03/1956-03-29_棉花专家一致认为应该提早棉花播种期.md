    Cotton Experts Unanimously Agree That Cotton Sowing Period Should Be Advanced
    The General Bureau of Economic Crop Production of the Ministry of Agriculture held a symposium on the issue of advancing the cotton sowing period on March 24th. Many cotton experts and cotton disease experts from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing Agricultural University, North China Agricultural Science Institute, and the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry participated.
    At this symposium, the experts unanimously agreed that the past sowing period in various cotton-growing areas of China was not timely and generally too late. Appropriately advancing and shortening the sowing period is one of the important measures for increasing cotton production. The meeting also discussed the precautions that must be taken for early cotton sowing.
    This year, the planned sowing period for most cotton-growing areas has been advanced by about ten days compared to previous years, and the time from the start to the end of sowing has also been shortened from more than twenty days in the past to within ten days. Preparations have also been made for the necessary measures to be taken in conjunction with early sowing. Shaanxi Province has decided to advance the sowing period from around April 20th in the past to start around April 10th, completing it in five to seven days. In addition, starting from April 1st, they will strengthen climate forecasting and soil temperature measurement, all cotton seeds will be finely selected, and the amount of seed sown per mu will be increased from ten jin in the past to fifteen jin, and an additional portion of seeds will be prepared for replanting.

    棉花专家一致认为应该提早棉花播种期
    农业部经济作物生产总局在三月二十四日召开了提早棉花播种期问题的座谈会。参加的有中国科学院，北京农业大学，华北农业科学研究所，北京市农林局等单位的许多棉花专家和棉病专家。
    在这次座谈会上，专家们一致认为我国各棉区过去的播种期不适时，一般偏晚，适当地提早并且缩短播种时期，是棉花增产的重要措施之一。会上还讨论了棉花早播必须注意的事项。
    今年大部棉区计划播种期都比往年提早十天左右，播种开始到结束的时间也从过去二十多天缩短到十天以内；对结合早播应该采取的必要措施也做了准备。陕西省决定把播种期由原来的四月二十日左右提早到十日左右开始，五天到七天完成。并且自四月一日起加强气候预报和测定地温工作，棉种全部经过精细粒选，每亩播种量也由过去的十斤增加到十五斤，还要另外准备一部分补种用的种子。
