    Protecting Weak Livestock

    The Changsheng Agricultural Production Cooperative of Le Village, Wenshui County, Shanxi Province, divided livestock into three classes: superior, medium, and inferior, according to their physical strength. The superior livestock were carefully fed, receiving two *jin* of good feed each day. The medium livestock were also given some bean cake. But the inferior livestock were not only denied feed, but were not even given enough grass. As a result, seven weak livestock died in just half a month. Similar incorrect methods of treating livestock were also adopted in the agricultural production cooperatives of Pushang Township, Jinglu County.

    Now, this situation has attracted the attention of the Wenshui County Committee and the Jinglu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. They have issued a circular regarding this matter. In addition to strictly criticizing the two agricultural cooperatives mentioned above, the circular also requires all township Party branches to conduct a comprehensive inspection of livestock feeding and management, formulate effective livestock feeding and management methods, strengthen the education of herders in protecting and cherishing livestock, and protect young and weak livestock.

    保护弱小牲畜
    山西省文水县乐村长胜农业生产合作社，把牲畜按照体力强弱划分为上、中、下三等。对上等的饲养周到，每天喂好料二斤，中等的每天也能喂点豆饼，对下等的不但不喂料，连草也不管饱。结果，仅仅半个月的时间，便死了七头弱小牲畜。静乐县铺上乡的农业生产合作社里也采取了类似的错误办法对待牲畜。
    现在，这种情况已经引起了中共文水县委和静乐县委的注意。为了这件事情，他们发了一个通报。通报中除开对上面说的两个农业合作社进行了严格的批评外，还要求各乡党支部对牲畜的饲养管理进行一次全面检查，定出行之有效的牲畜饲养管理办法，加强对饲养员的保畜爱畜教育，把幼小牲畜保护好。
