Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 25th: As previously reported, the Soviet government sent a note to the U.S. government on February 18 regarding the issue of American balloons entering Soviet airspace. On March 1st, the U.S. Embassy delivered a reply note from the U.S. government to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The U.S. note denied that the released American balloons endangered air traffic and reiterated the U.S. claim that the balloons were released for meteorological observation. The note insisted that although the Soviet government opposed the flight of American balloons in Soviet airspace, the Soviet Union itself flew balloons into the airspace of the United States and other countries. The note stated that the United States would no longer release "balloons that might fly into Soviet territory" and once again requested that the Soviet Union return the balloon equipment to the United States. The note also rejected the Soviet government's suggestion to hold an exhibition of American balloons, and proposed the development of a "common plan" for the use of technology and equipment on an international scale.

On March 24th, Soviet First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Kuznetsov, met with the U.S. Chargé d'Affaires ad interim in the Soviet Union, Homsley, and handed him the Soviet government's reply to the U.S. government's note.

The Soviet note stated: The Soviet government, in its notes of February 4th and February 18th, already pointed out that the American balloons that flew into Soviet airspace were suspended with instruments, including automatic cameras for topographical photography and radio transceivers, weighing up to 650 kilograms. These materials have refuted the U.S. note's insistence that the American balloons released into Soviet airspace were for meteorological observations and posed no danger to air traffic.

The note refuted the U.S. government's assertion that holding an exhibition of American balloons intercepted in the Soviet Union would exacerbate international tensions. It pointed out that it is not the organization of such exhibitions that will exacerbate international tensions, but rather the illegal actions of the American authorities in releasing balloons into Soviet airspace, thereby violating the inviolability of Soviet airspace.

The note pointed out that the U.S. government's assertion that the Soviet Union also releases balloons into the airspace of other countries, and that Soviet balloons fly over U.S. territory, is not in accordance with the actual situation. The Soviet Union has never released balloons into the airspace of the United States or any other country in the past, and it is not doing so now. The note suggested that in order to clarify the truth, it would be best to hold simultaneous exhibitions, displaying the American balloons intercepted in the Soviet Union and the "Soviet balloons" that the U.S. government claims to possess.

### 苏联就美国放气球问题再次照会美国

    苏联就美国放气球问题再次照会美国
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科二十五日讯：前已报道，苏联政府曾经在二月十八日就美国气球放入苏联领空的问题给美国政府一份照会。三月一日，美国大使馆把美国政府的一份复照交给了苏联外交部。美国的照会否认放出的美国气球危及航空交通，并且重复美国放出气球是为了进行气象观测的说法。照会硬说苏联政府虽然反对美国的气球在苏联领空飞行，而苏联自己的气球却飞入美国及其他国家的领空。照会表示，美国将不再放出“可能飞到苏联境内的气球”，并且再一次要苏联把气球装备归还美国。照会还拒绝了苏联政府关于举办美国气球展览会的建议，而提出要在国际范围内制定一个使用技术和装备的“共同计划”。
    三月二十四日，苏联外交部第一副部长库兹?佐夫接见了美国驻苏联临时代办华姆斯莱，并且把苏联政府对美国政府照会的答复交给他。
    苏联的照会说：苏联政府在二月四日和二月十八日的照会中已经指出，飞入苏联领空的美国气球悬挂有包括拍摄地形用的自动照相机和无线电收发报机在内的仪器，这些仪器重达六百五十公斤。这些材料已经驳斥了美国照会中硬说放入苏联领空的美国气球是为了气象观测，对航空交通并无危险的说法。
    照会驳斥了美国政府硬说举行在苏联截获的美国气球的展览会会促使国际局势紧张的说法，它指出：会促使国际局势紧张的绝不是组织这类展览会，而是美国当局把气球放入苏联的领空从而破坏苏联的领空不可侵犯性的这种非法行动。
    照会指出，美国政府硬说苏联也把气球放入其他国家的领空，硬说苏联的气球在美国国土上空飞行，这种说法是不符合实际情况的。苏联过去不曾把气球放进美国或者是其他任何国家的领空，而且现在也没有这样做。照会建议说：为了弄明真相，最好是同时举行展览会，展出在苏联截获的美国气球和美国政府自称拥有的“苏联气球”。
