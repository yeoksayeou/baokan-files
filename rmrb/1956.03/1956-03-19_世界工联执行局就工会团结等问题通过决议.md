Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 18th. The 29th session of the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions, which began on March 13th in Prague, closed on the 16th.

The resolution adopted at the meeting stated that the most prominent feature of the current international trade union movement is the working people's desire for unity. In most capitalist and colonial countries, this desire is manifested in the strengthening of joint actions by working people to achieve their immediate demands, the strengthening of contacts and cooperation between working people, trade union leaders of all factions, and trade union organizations, and the increasing frequency of joint actions by various trade unions. The resolution believes that all trade union organizations belonging to the World Federation of Trade Unions, all trade union organizations belonging to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, and various independent trade unions should strive to eliminate all obstacles hindering international trade union unity.

The Executive Bureau reaffirmed the resolution adopted at its 28th session, which abolished the incorrect resolution of 1950 concerning the Trade Union Confederation of Yugoslavia, considering that resolution to be contrary to the policy of uniting all trade unions.

The resolution listed the various demands that would provide a solid foundation for the harmony and cooperation of all trade union organizations. These demands are: raising wages and shortening working hours; disarmament and easing international tensions; granting independence to oppressed peoples; and respecting trade union rights and democratic freedoms.

The resolution called on working people and trade union organizations to take joint action to demand disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, and called on trade unions in colonial countries to form a united front to fight for the realization of social and economic demands, for national independence, and for peace.

The resolution emphasized the important role played by the Bandung Conference in the development of the national movements of oppressed peoples, and considered it necessary to launch a continuous movement to widely publicize the principles adopted by the Bandung Conference.

Referring to the International Labor Women's Conference, which will be held in June this year at the initiative of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the resolution stated that this conference must become a powerful factor in strengthening the cooperation of working women and trade union organizations.

    世界工联执行局就工会团结等问题通过决议
    新华社布拉格18日电　从3月13日开始在布拉格举行的世界工会联合会执行局第二十九次会议已经在16日闭幕。
    会议通过的决议说，目前国际工会运动的最突出的特征就是劳动人民争取团结的愿望。在大多数资本主义国家和殖民地国家里，这种愿望表现在劳动人民争取实现他们的切身要求的联合行动的加强，劳动人民、一切派别的工会领袖和工会组织之间的接触和合作的加强，以及各工会的联合行动的日益频繁。决议认为属于世界工会联合会的一切工会组织，属于国际自由工会联合会的一切工会组织以及各独立工会应该努力来消除阻挠国际工会团结的一切障碍。
    执行局重申了它第二十八次会议通过的决议，那个决议废除了1950年关于南斯拉夫工会联合会的不正确的决议，认为那项决议是违背团结一切工会的政策的。
    决议列举了将为一切工会组织的和睦和合作提供巩固的基础的各项要求。这些要求是：提高工资和缩短工作时间；裁减军备和缓和国际紧张局势；给被压迫的人民以独立；尊重工会的权利和民主自由。
    决议号召劳动人民和工会组织采取联合行动来要求裁减军备和禁止原子武器，号召殖民地国家的工会结成联合阵线来为实现社会和经济要求、为民族独立和和平而进行斗争。
    决议着重指出了万隆会议在被压迫的人民的民族运动的发展中所起的重要作用，并且认为有必要发动一个连续不断的运动来广泛宣传万隆会议所通过的原则。
    决议在谈到根据世界工会联合会的倡议将在今年6月召开的国际劳动妇女大会时说，这个大会必须成为加强劳动妇女以及各工会组织的合作的强有力的因素。
