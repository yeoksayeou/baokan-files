Xinhua News Agency, March 15th: Since January, provinces such as Henan, Shandong, Jilin, Qinghai, Yunnan, Guizhou, and cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Chongqing have successively convened meetings of literacy activists.

    Those attending the meetings of literacy activists included principals of people-run schools who diligently run schools in these areas, teachers and instructors who actively teach, primary school teachers who actively participate in literacy work, students who persist in literacy learning, and representatives of organizations such as the Chinese Communist Party branches, Communist Youth League branches, and youth literacy teams. At the Henan Province's meeting of rural literacy activists, 45 grassroots units and 160 activists who diligently studied, taught conscientiously, and enthusiastically ran schools were rewarded. At the Tianjin Municipality's meeting of literacy activists, Tianjin Steel Plant, which received an award, proposed a call to all factories in the city to carry out literacy work for workers.

    At the Chongqing Municipality's meeting of youth literacy activists, the joint people-run school of Wujing and Xinong villages in Wenxing Township was commended. Since 1953, this people-run school has ensured that an average of more than 85% of its students persist in year-round learning, and more than 80% of its students are able to advance to higher levels. Currently, the number of students enrolled in these two villages accounts for 75% of the illiterate population.
