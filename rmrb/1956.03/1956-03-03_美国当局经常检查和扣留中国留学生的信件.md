    Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. US authorities are constantly inspecting and detaining letters to Chinese students in the United States. This is the accusation made by students who recently returned to the motherland from the US.

    Dr. He Binglin, who studied organic chemistry at Indiana State University in the United States, said, "Although the Americans are very careful when inspecting letters, using steam to moisten the envelopes so as not to leave traces, one of my friends agreed with his family in advance to make a mark where the letter was folded, so it was often possible to discover that the US authorities had opened and read our letters. I learned from reliable sources that the US government hired a group of Chinese people specifically to read intercepted letters."

    Dr. Zou Lude, a medical doctor from New York University, said, "After I returned to China, I heard from my husband that she had written me a letter two or three months earlier, mentioning the agreement between China and the United States regarding the return of civilians from both sides, and telling me that if I encountered any difficulties in returning to China, I could ask the Indian Embassy in the United States for help. But I did not receive that letter."

    Two other students, Zhang Fahui, who studied entomology in Wisconsin, and Jiang Xikui, who studied organic chemistry at the University of Washington in Seattle, both said they had similar experiences. They did not receive letters from relatives and friends in China reporting on the situation at home and urging them to return to the country. They only heard from their relatives and friends about these letters after they returned to their hometowns.

    美国当局经常检查和扣留中国留学生的信件
    新华社2日讯　美国当局不断检查并且扣留我国留美学生的信件。这是新近回到祖国的留美学生提出的指责。
    曾经在美国印第安纳州立大学学有机化学的何炳林博士说：“虽然美国人在检查信件的时候很小心，用蒸汽湿润信封以便不留痕迹，但是我的一个朋友事先和家人约好，在摺起来的地方作记号，因此常常可以发现美国当局拆阅我们的信件。我从可靠方面得知，美国政府雇佣了一批中国人专门阅读截获的信件。”
    纽约大学医学博士邹路得说：“我在回国以后才听我的爱人说起她在两、三个月以前给我写过一封信，信里提到中美关于双方平民回国问题的协议，并且告诉我假如回国碰到任何困难，可以请印度驻美大使馆帮助。可是我没有收到那封信。”
    另外两位留学生，曾在威斯康星州学昆虫学的张发慧和曾在西雅图市华盛顿大学攻读有机化学的蒋锡夔，都说他们有类似的经验。他们都没有收到国内亲友给他们报告国内情况并敦促他们回国的信件。他们只在回到家乡以后，才听亲友们说起曾经写过这类信件。
