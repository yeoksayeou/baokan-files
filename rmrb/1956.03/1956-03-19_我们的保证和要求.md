Our Guarantee and Demands
Wang Wenshan, Model Worker of Shenyang, Director of No. 1 Processing Workshop, Shenyang First Machine Tool Plant

This year, our workshop originally planned to produce 1,200 1A62 lathes. Later, after discussions among the workers, in order to complete the tasks during the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, we requested and received approval from higher authorities to increase production to 2,000 units. Everyone's confidence and enthusiasm are very high. Workers in various sections and groups have studied six advanced experiences, such as multi-tool multi-edge and high-speed cutting, and production efficiency has generally improved.

However, the completion of our workshop's production plan for January and February was not satisfactory. In January, of the original plan to process 10 units of 750 cubic meter lathes, only 4 were processed; after the small shaft section promoted advanced experience, it was originally estimated that the monthly cumulative plan could be overfulfilled by February 23, but by the end of February, the total production volume had only exceeded by 6%. The workers all felt that they had the energy but couldn't use it.

Why is it that the workers have such high morale and have learned so many advanced experiences, yet they still cannot overfulfill the plan more significantly? The main reason is the untimely supply of materials and tools. In January, the original plan to process 10 units of 750 cubic meter lathes could not be put into production because the bed castings were not supplied. In February, more than 60 out of the 100+ types of raw materials needed by the workshop were not supplied on schedule. In terms of tools, the 3,000 RPM high-efficiency vertical grinders have been unable to produce since June last year due to a lack of grinding wheels. Deep hole drills for special machine tools in the workshop and reamers for processing more than 10 kinds of parts are also not supplied. What is particularly distressing is that our assembly line workshop, which is designed according to Soviet technology and organizes dedicated personnel and machines for production, has to assign workers whatever materials are available, disrupting the work plan due to the lack of supply of tools and materials.

Of course, there are certain objective difficulties in the supply of some materials and tools; but as long as we take the initiative to look for them, it is not as if there is no way to solve them. Last month, the factory used substitute materials to overcome the shortage of some materials. Our workshop also sent planning dispatchers to assist the tool section in solving the supply problem of more than 100 kinds of tools and grinding wheels at the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory. For example, for the drills that the workshop urgently needed, the tool section claimed they didn't have any, but we assisted them in checking the tool warehouse and found 6 at once.

However, some functional departments in the factory often lack this initiative. Things that were originally not a problem are made into "problems," and the "passing the buck" never ends. The problem of 750 cubic meter bed castings is like this. The casting workshop delayed the date because of the lack of sandboxes. When investigating the reason, the production section pushed the blame to the tool section for issuing the plan late, and the tool section pushed the blame to the forging and metallurgy section for making the templates late. They pushed the blame back and forth, and no one was willing to take responsibility.

In order to ensure the early completion of the First Five-Year Plan, I must do my job better in the future, especially to emphasize saving. In the past, we emphasized more on quantity, speed, and quality, but we have not done enough in terms of saving, especially how to protect and save materials and prolong the life of tools, and we have also paid little attention to summarizing advanced experiences in this area. We must educate and unite all employees to seriously overcome this shortcoming in the future. In addition, I would also like to make two requests to the leadership.

(1) I hope that the factory leaders and relevant departments will pay attention to production preparation work and change the current situation of issuing targets on one hand and demanding products on the other, without paying much attention to the supply of materials and tools. For some materials and tools, such as grinding wheels, which the factory really cannot solve, I hope the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry will provide assistance.

(2) I hope that the higher-level Party committee and economic organs will help us reduce the burden of meetings. Some responsible cadres in our factory are busy attending meetings all day long, and they simply cannot spare time to go down to the workshops. My recent situation is still good, there are not too many meetings outside the factory, but the meetings within the factory are already enough. From January to mid-February, in 45 working days, in addition to attending more than 20 large and small meetings in the workshop, I also attended 15 meetings of the factory and various departments. Some meetings last for seven or eight hours. Because I am busy attending meetings, I do not have time to read many important documents, and even if I read them, I cannot digest them well. As a workshop leader, the time I actually spend going to the workshop to understand the production situation is also very limited. Therefore, I hope that the higher-level Party committee, economic organs, the factory, and the workshop will all pay attention to this issue so that cadres can really think more about production issues.

### 我们的保证和要求

    我们的保证和要求
    沈阳市劳动模范沈阳第一机床厂一号加工车间主任  王文山
    今年，我们车间原订生产1，200台1A62车床，后来经过职工们讨论，为了提前完成第一个五年计划期间的任务，请求上级批准，增加到2，000台。大伙信心和积极性满高。各个工段、小组的工人学习了多刀多刃、高速切削等6种先进经验，生产效率一般都提高了。
    可是，我们车间1、2月份生产计划完成得并不令人满意。1月份原定加工的10台750立米车床，仅只加工了4台；小轴工段推广先进经验以后，原来估计到2月23日就可以超额完成当月累进计划，但是直到2月底，生产总额仅仅超额了6％。工人们都感到有劲没有使出来。
    为什么工人的情绪这么高，又学习了这么多先进经验，还不能更多地超额完成计划呢？主要原因是材料和工具供应不及时。1月份，原计划加工的10台750立米车床，因为床身铸件供应不上，不能投入生产。2月份车间需要的100多种原料，有60多种没有按期供应。在工具方面，3，000转高效率的立式磨床由于缺砂轮，从去年6月以来长期不能生产。车间专用机床上的深孔钻头，和加工10多种部件用的绞刀，也都供应不上。特别令人苦恼的，就是我们这个按照苏联工艺设计，组织专人、专床进行生产的流水线车间，因为工具材料供应不上，只好来啥料，给工人派啥活，打乱了作业计划。
    当然，有些材料和工具的供应，是有一定客观困难的；但是只要主动去找，并不是一点办法也没有的。上个月厂里就曾经利用代用料，克服了部分材料不足的困难。我们车间也曾经派计划调度员协助工具科到哈尔滨量具刃具厂解决了100多种工具和砂轮的供应问题。又如车间迫切需要的钻头，工具科嚷着没有，我们协助他们到工具库清查，一次就找到了6个。
    可是，厂里的一些职能单位常常缺乏这种主动性。本来不成问题的事情也给闹出“问题”来，而且“扯皮”没个完。750立米床身的铸件问题就是这样。铸工车间因为缺砂箱拖延了日期，追究原因的时候，生产科推工具科计划下得晚，工具科推锻冶科形板做得晚，推来扯去，谁也不愿负责。
    为了保证提前完成第一个五年计划，今后我一定要更好地做好自己的工作，特别是要强调节省。过去我们在多、快、好方面强调得多些，在省的方面，特别是如何爱护、节约材料和延长工具寿命方面，做得还很不够，也很少注意总结这方面的先进经验。这个缺点，今后一定要教育和团结全体职工来认真克服。另外，我也要对领导方面提出两点要求。
    （一）希望工厂领导和有关科室重视生产准备工作，改变现在这种一手下指标，一手要产品，不太过问材料和工具供应工作的情况。有些材料和工具，例如砂轮，厂里确实无法解决，希望第一机械工业部给予帮助。
    （二）希望上级党委和经济机关帮助我们减少一些会议负担。我们厂里的一些负责干部都是整天忙着开会，简直抽不出时间来下车间。我最近的情形还算好，厂外的会议不太多了，但是厂内的会议也已经够开的。1月份到2月中旬45个工作日里，我除了参加车间大小会议20多次外，还参加了15次工厂以及各部门的会议。有些会议一开就是七、八个小时。由于忙着开会，许多重要的文件也来不及看，看了也不能很好地消化，作为一个车间领导人员，真正下到车间了解生产情况的时间也挤得很少。因此，希望上级党委、经济机关、厂里和车间里都来注意这个问题，使干部们真正能多考虑些生产上的问题。
