    The Filipino People Demand an End to the Privileged Status of American Colonialists in the Philippines

    Recently, a new act of tyranny, in which American troops stationed in the Philippines violated Philippine national sovereignty and trampled on the Filipino people, occurred in Tarlac Province in Southern Luzon, Philippines. According to Agence France-Presse, on March 17th, a Filipino mine owner named Enrique Santamaria in Tarlac Province was unreasonably detained by the American military authorities, and his manganese ore was confiscated. Agence France-Presse said that after this incident occurred, the Philippine "Senate was in an uproar." Senator Emmanuel Pelaez, Chairman of the Senate Defense and Security Committee, believed that "the Tarlac incident highlights the need to immediately renegotiate to clarify the disputes." Other members of the Defense and Security Committee agreed with Pelaez's opinion.
    The uproar in the Philippine Senate is not accidental. The United States declared the Philippines independent in July 1946, but in reality, it retained all of its naval, land, and air force bases in the Philippines, exercising military control over the Philippines.
    At present, the United States has no less than forty military bases in the Philippines. The naval base is centered on Manila Bay, and the air force base is centered on Clark in Pampanga Province. These two main bases are both located in the northern part of the archipelago, in the center of Luzon Island. In addition, the bases on Cebu Island and Mactan Island in the central part of the archipelago control the vast area south of Luzon Island. The establishment and continuous expansion of American military bases has caused Philippine residents to lose large tracts of land that they rely on for their livelihoods. American soldiers enjoy various privileges in the areas where the bases are located and act arrogantly. Last summer, the US military authorities at the Ulongapo Naval Base near Subic Bay even arbitrarily set out regulations for managing the area. According to these regulations, the US military authorities can arbitrarily expel Filipinos from the area, casually collect exorbitant taxes, interfere with the functions of the Philippine local government, discriminate against Filipinos... At that time, a Manila newspaper wrote that the United States had made "Filipinos foreigners in their own country."
    The issue of land ownership for American military bases in the Philippines has been disputed between the United States and the Philippines for several years and has not yet been resolved. Filipinos rightly believe that since the United States declared the Philippines independent, all Philippine territory, including the land on which American military bases are located, naturally belongs to the Philippines. Even according to the "US-Philippine Military Base Agreement" imposed on the Philippines by the United States in 1947, the bases maintained by the United States in the Philippines should only be leased, and the land ownership should belong to the Philippines. However, the United States stubbornly refuses to recognize this sovereignty and wants to occupy these bases permanently. US Attorney General Herbert Brownell said in 1952 that the bases occupied by the United States before granting the Philippines independence in 1946 still belonged to the US government. In 1954, Brownell again said that the United States owns the naval and land military bases in the Philippines. Not long ago, US Secretary of the Navy Thomas publicly stated that he would submit the issue of American base ownership in the Philippines and the issue of jurisdiction over these bases to the US President for review.
    The attitude taken by the United States on the issue of base ownership exposes the colonialist nature of the US relationship with the Philippines. Regarding this point, the "Manila Chronicle" once wrote: No Filipino can agree with the statement of the US Secretary of the Navy. Thomas, like many other Americans, is "unwilling to recognize the independence of the Philippines."
    In fact, the United States' infringement on Philippine sovereignty goes far beyond continuing to occupy military bases. Currently, in the Philippines, the vast US Embassy, with more than two thousand staff members, controls various departments of the Philippine government. The "Bell Trade Act," which the United States imposed on the Philippines at the same time as declaring Philippine independence, deprived the Philippines of the right to manage its own foreign trade and tariffs. Francisco Dalupan, President of the Philippine "University of the East," aptly described this trade agreement as "the shackles of economic enslavement" of the Philippines by the United States. American monopoly capital controls the Philippine economy, finance, and banking through investments, banks, and trading companies. Even the publication of books and magazines is monopolized by the "Philippine Education Company" in the United States.
    Although the United States is trying its best to disguise itself as a "anti-colonialist" hero, and the US Ambassador to the Philippines shamelessly boasts that "the United States has laid the type and method for the independence of the Philippines," the fact that the United States continues to maintain colonial rule in the Philippines cannot be concealed after all. Philippine Senator Recto exposed the hypocrisy of the independence granted to the Philippines by the United States, saying that now "the US Embassy here arbitrarily decides the foreign policy of the Philippines, the US Joint Military Advisory Group decides military policy, and the US Foreign Aid Administration decides economic policy." Recently, Philippine House Speaker Jose Laurel Jr. also criticized the US enslavement policy towards the Philippines, saying that the Philippines is currently under "a more subtle and therefore more despicable new oppression," and that "Filipinos are treated as intruders rather than masters on their own territory, and as people of an annexed state rather than as an autonomous nation."
    This humiliating subordinate status of the Philippines in its relationship with the United States stands in sharp contrast to the increasing international prestige of many countries in Asia and Africa that have embarked on the path of independence. Therefore, naturally, public dissatisfaction in the Philippines with American infringements on Philippine sovereignty and independence has recently increased significantly. Manila Mayor Arsenio Lacson pointed out that Filipinos "now have a growing sense of aversion to the United States." The "Manila Chronicle" said: "Only when the United States stops treating the Philippines as a colony will the current criticism of US actions in the Philippines cease."
    As US-Philippine negotiations on military bases are about to be held, more and more Filipinos are demanding that the government refuse to cede ownership of American military bases on Philippine territory to the United States in the negotiations. The "Manila Chronicle" warned the Philippine negotiators: "If they trade away sovereignty for shiny cannons and powerful jets, then they have reason to fear the wrath of the people." It is clear that the demand of the Filipino people is for the Philippine government to safeguard the sovereignty and interests of the Philippine people in negotiations with the United States and to end the privileged status of American colonialism in the Philippines.

    菲律宾人民要求结束美国殖民者在菲律宾的特权地位
    萧光
    最近在菲律宾吕宋岛南部丹辘省发生了一次美国驻在菲律宾的军队侵犯菲律宾国家主权和蹂躏菲律宾人民的新的横暴事件。据法新社报道，三月十七日，丹辘省一个名叫恩里克·桑塔马里亚的菲律宾矿主遭到美国军事当局的无理拘押，并被没收了他的锰矿砂。法新社说，这一事件发生后，菲律宾“参议院群情激昂”。参议院国防和安全委员会主席埃曼努·佩拉埃斯认为，“丹辘事件强调指出有必要立即重新谈判以澄清争端。”国防和安全委员会的其他委员同意佩拉埃斯的意见。
    菲律宾参议院的群情激昂，并不是偶然的。美国在1946年7月就宣布了赋予菲律宾独立，而实际上却保留着它在菲律宾的全部海、陆、空军基地，对菲律宾实行着军事控制。
    目前，美国在菲律宾的军事基地不下四十处。海军基地以马尼拉湾为中心，空军基地以邦邦加省的克拉克为中心。这两个主要基地都在群岛北部、吕宋岛的中央。另外，又以群岛中部的宿务岛和麦克岛的基地控制着吕宋岛以南的广阔地区。美国军事基地的建立和不断扩充，使得菲律宾居民丧失了大片赖以为生的土地。美国军人在基地的驻在区域享有种种特权，横行霸道。去年夏天，苏必克湾附近乌朗牙坡海军基地的美军当局，甚至擅自定出管理这个地区的条例。按照这种条例，美军当局可以任意把菲律宾人驱逐出这个地区，随便征收苛捐杂税，干涉菲律宾地方政府的职权，歧视菲律宾人……。当时马尼拉的一家报纸写道，美国已使“菲律宾人成了自己国家的外国人”。
    关于在菲律宾的美国军事基地的土地所有权，美国和菲律宾已经争执了好几年，直到现在还没有解决。菲律宾人理所当然地认为，既然美国宣布了给予菲律宾以独立，菲律宾的全部国土包括设有美国军事基地的土地在内，自然属于菲律宾。即使根据1947年美国强加于菲律宾的“美菲军事基地协定”，美国在菲律宾保持的基地，也只能是租借性质，土地所有权应该属于菲律宾。但是美国却蛮横地不承认这个主权，想把这些基地永远占为己有。美国司法部长赫伯特·布朗纳尔在1952年就说：在1946年授予菲律宾独立以前美国所占据的基地仍旧属于美国政府。1954年，布朗纳尔又说，美国对于在菲律宾的海军和陆军军事基地拥有所有权。不久以前，美国海军部长托马斯公开声明，他将把菲律宾的美国基地所有权的问题和在这些基地上面的裁判权问题提交美国总统审核。
    美国对基地所有权所采取的态度，暴露了美国对菲律宾的关系的殖民主义实质。关于这一点，“马尼拉纪事报”曾经写道：没有一个菲律宾人能够同意美国海军部长的声明。托马斯，也像其他许多美国人一样，并“不愿意承认菲律宾的独立”。
    事实上，美国对菲律宾主权的侵犯，远不止于继续霸占军事基地。目前，在菲律宾，组织庞大的美国大使馆有着二千以上的工作人员，他们控制着菲律宾政府的各部门。美国在宣布给菲律宾独立的同时加在菲律宾头上的“贝尔贸易法”，剥夺了菲律宾管理自己的对外贸易和关税的权利。菲律宾“东方大学”校长弗朗西斯科·达卢潘恰当地把这个贸易协定形容为美国对菲律宾的“经济奴役的枷锁”。美国的垄断资本通过投资、银行、贸易公司控制了菲律宾的经济、财政和金融。连书刊的发行，美国也利用“菲律宾教育公司”进行垄断。
    尽管美国竭力把自己装扮成“反殖民主义”的英雄，美国驻菲律宾大使大言不惭地吹嘘“美国为菲律宾的独立奠定了类型和方式”，但是美国在菲律宾继续保持着殖民统治的事实毕竟是掩饰不了的。菲律宾参议员雷克托就揭露了美国给予菲律宾的独立的虚伪性，他说，现在“独断地决定菲律宾的外交政策的是此地的美国大使馆，决定军事政策的是美国军事联合顾问团，而决定经济政策的是美国援外事务管理署”。最近，菲律宾众议院议长小何塞·劳雷尔也抨击美国对菲律宾的奴役政策说，菲律宾目前处于“一种更加巧妙因而也就更加卑鄙的新的压迫的铁蹄”之下，“菲律宾人在自己的领土上被当作闯入者而不是被当作主人翁看待，被当作附属国人民而不是被当作自主民族看待”。
    菲律宾在和美国关系上的这种屈辱的附属地位，同亚非地区许多走上了独立道路的国家的日益提高的国际威望，形成了尖锐的对照。因此自然地菲律宾公众对于美国侵犯菲律宾主权和独立的不满最近有了显著的增长。马尼拉市长阿塞尼奥·拉克森指出，菲律宾人“现在对美国有一种日益强烈的厌恶情绪。”“马尼拉纪事报”说：“只有美国停止以殖民地对待菲律宾，目前对美国在菲律宾的行动的批评才会停止。”
    美菲关于军事基地的谈判将要举行，愈来愈多的菲律宾人要求政府在谈判中拒绝把菲律宾领土上的美国军事基地的所有权割让给美国。“马尼拉纪事报”警告菲律宾方面的谈判代表：“如果他们用出卖主权来换取闪闪发光的大炮和厉害的喷气式飞机，那么他们就有理由来担心人民的愤怒。”显而易见，菲律宾人民的要求是要菲律宾政府在同美国的谈判中维护菲律宾的主权和人民的利益，结束美国在菲律宾的殖民主义特权地位。
