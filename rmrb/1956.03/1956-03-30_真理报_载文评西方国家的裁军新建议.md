Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 29th: Borovsky commented in the "People's Daily" on the 28th on the new proposals put forward by Western countries in the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee, saying that from the content of the Anglo-French plan and the American plan reported in the Western newspapers, it is clear that these plans are far from being a step forward, but a regression compared to the proposals previously discussed by the United Nations bodies and the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly.

	Borovsky said that the so-called phased disarmament plan put forward by Britain and France this time does not stipulate to what level the armed forces of each country should be reduced, and postpones the prohibition of nuclear weapons, and even the testing of such weapons, indefinitely. The plan even stipulates that weapons of mass destruction can be used without the permission of the Security Council. Therefore, this plan does not meet the requirements of the people of all countries who expect the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee to formulate a practical and truly feasible disarmament plan.

	Borovsky said that as for the new proposals put forward by the United States, not only did they retreat from the limits on armed forces previously stipulated by Western countries, but they were not fundamentally related to the issue of disarmament at all.

	The US plan does not actually go beyond the surveillance plan of gathering intelligence on the territory of other countries, and does not mention the prohibition of nuclear weapons at all.

	Borovsky said that one cannot but draw the conclusion that the position now held by the United States in the Subcommittee and the proposals of Britain and France cannot serve as a suitable basis for solving the disarmament problem. If the Western countries' plan is adopted, it will only allow the arms expansion that the people of all countries are demanding to stop to continue.

    “真理报”载文评西方国家的裁军新建议
    新华社29日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：波罗夫斯基二十八日在“真理报”上评论西方国家在联合国裁军小组委员会上提出的新建议说，从西方报纸报道的英法计划和美国计划的内容中可以明显地看出，这些计划远不是前进了一步，而是比起联合国机构早先已经讨论过的建议和大会所通过的决议后退了。
    波罗夫斯基说，英法两国这次提出的所谓分阶段的裁军计划没有规定各国的武装部队应该裁减到什么样的水平，而且把禁止核子武器，甚至禁止试验这种武器无限期地推延了。这个计划甚至规定不得安全理事会允许就能使用大规模毁灭性武器。因此，这个计划是不符合各国人民期待着联合国裁军小组委员会制定出一个切实可行的真正裁军计划的要求的。
    波罗夫斯基说，至于美国提出的新建议，不但没有包括西方国家以前规定的武装部队的限额，从这点后退下来，而且实际上同裁军问题根本联系不起来。
    美国计划实际上没有超出要在其他国家的领土上搜集情报的那种监督的计划，而且根本没有提到禁止核子武器的问题。
    波罗夫斯基说，不能不得出这样的结论：美国现在在小组委员会所持的立场以及英法两国的建议，都不能作为解决裁军问题的合适的基础。如果通过西方国家的计划，只会使得各国人民要求停止的扩充军备继续进行下去。
