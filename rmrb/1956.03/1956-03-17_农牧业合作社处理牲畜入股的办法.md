Methods of Handling Livestock as Shares in Agricultural and Pastoral Cooperatives
By our correspondent Lin Mo

In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the hundreds of agricultural and pastoral production cooperatives generally use the following three methods to deal with livestock issues: (1) Privately owned livestock of cooperative members are cared for by the cooperative, with the livestock owners paying for grazing fees. – Some also use young livestock as grazing fees. For example, for tending six or seven cows, one calf is given to the cooperative each year to be kept as public property. (2) Breeding-age female livestock are used as shares, managed uniformly by the cooperative, with profits distributed according to a suitable ratio of labor and livestock shares; generally, scattered livestock are tended by the cooperative, with the livestock owners paying for grazing fees – very few cooperatives only take the manure and don't charge grazing fees. (3) Livestock is valued and transferred to the cooperative, achieving complete pastoral collectivization.

When cooperatives are first established, the first method – caretaking by the cooperative – is often used. This method is more easily accepted by the masses. Although this method can solve certain difficulties for cooperative members, it greatly restricts unified management. Therefore, such cooperatives generally do not regard animal husbandry as an important business item, and it is difficult to carry out major reforms in production.

Adopting the third method, valuing livestock and transferring it to the cooperative, can completely collectivize animal husbandry. However, if the work foundation is not strong, the masses are not highly conscious, or there are other favorable conditions, adopting this method from the beginning will not be easily accepted by the masses.

In the current situation, the second method – female livestock as shares and profit sharing according to a ratio – is more appropriate and can be widely promoted. This approach takes into account the masses' private ownership concept of livestock and provides certain conditions for implementing collective management and improving breeding management. At the same time, it can accumulate experience, create conditions, and gradually transition to a fully socialist collective ownership.

When implementing female livestock as shares and profit sharing, how should labor and livestock shares be divided? How much should each receive to be considered appropriate? There are two bases for determining the distribution ratio: First, after liberation, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region widely promoted the new "Suruk" system (i.e., the system of renting out livestock) in pastoral areas. According to this system, if one rents out their livestock to others, the livestock owner generally receives about 60% of the product, and the person tending the livestock receives about 40%. Second, in areas where "Suruk" is not used, detailed calculations can be used to roughly determine the distribution ratio. For example, the various expenses for 100 livestock in animal husbandry production for one year – including grazing fees, shed equipment, tools, fodder, lambing, livestock protection, and the labor spent on milking, etc. – can be calculated together in monetary terms, which is roughly the portion that the cooperative should distribute according to labor. Subtracting all production expenses from the product income of 100 livestock is the portion to be received by the livestock owners.

The New Pastoral Cooperative, one of the earliest agricultural and pastoral production cooperatives established in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, determined an appropriate distribution ratio after detailed calculations of the expenditure and income figures of the livestock owned by three households and repeated discussions among the masses. Their specific distribution method is shown in the following table:

The distribution ratio also varies in different regions of Inner Mongolia: in areas with more livestock and less labor, the proportion distributed according to labor should be higher; in areas with less livestock and more labor, the proportion distributed according to labor may be slightly lower. At the same time, as production increases and the socialist consciousness of cooperative members improves after the establishment of the cooperative, the proportion distributed according to labor will gradually increase. For example, one year after the establishment of the New Pastoral Cooperative, with the approval of the general meeting of all members, the labor-based allocation of calves had increased to over 40%. At the same time, the members felt that milking and making dairy products (butter, milk curd) required a lot of labor, so the original 6-livestock, 4-labor distribution ratio for dairy products was changed to 6-labor, 4-livestock. Lamb wool (lambs born in the spring are sheared once in the autumn, at which time the lambs have not yet been distributed) was changed to a fully labor-based distribution. In less than two years, the New Pastoral Cooperative has valued and transferred the privately owned scattered livestock of its members to the cooperative. They are continuing to create conditions to further value and transfer female livestock to the cooperative and transition to a fully socialist advanced cooperative.

The transition of animal husbandry from private ownership to socialist collective ownership also requires herdsmen to undergo fierce ideological struggles. The leadership must carry out in-depth and meticulous propaganda work. Farmers and herdsmen in semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas have a weak concept of private land ownership, but a stronger concept of private livestock ownership. Some are herdsmen who mainly rely on animal husbandry for their livelihood. Some people have deep feelings for livestock and even treat them like children or relatives. Generally, the more livestock people have, the greater their concerns and hesitations. Some are very enthusiastic when registering to join the cooperative, but are reluctant when driving the livestock to the cooperative. Some even ask to leave their most beloved livestock behind to "take care of it in its old age." Some join the cooperative, but only after one year of production, when they see that the livestock are better cared for than in the past and that they are receiving a good share, do their thoughts begin to solidify.

Staff assisting in establishing cooperatives and leaders of agricultural and pastoral cooperatives should understand this psychology of farmers and herdsmen. They must patiently and continuously educate the masses through specific examples. They must not be simplistic or treat them rudely.

Of course, excessively emphasizing the private ownership concept of farmers and herdsmen towards livestock; acting as if the masses will slaughter livestock and cause trouble as soon as animal husbandry is reformed; being alarmed by individual farmers and herdsmen whose thoughts fluctuate because of livestock joining the cooperative; and turning the policy of "prudent and steady transformation of animal husbandry" into being timid and slow to move forward are also wrong. In fact, in the semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia, on the basis of basically achieving semi-socialist cooperation in agriculture, under the influence of the national socialist upsurge, it is possible to carry out the transformation of animal husbandry faster and better. This will not only bring great benefits to agricultural and animal husbandry production in these areas, but also have a strong driving and promoting effect on the socialist transformation of the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia.

    农牧业合作社处理牲畜入股的办法
    本报记者　林沫
    内蒙古自治区的几百个农牧业生产合作社大致是用以下三种方式处理畜牧问题的：（一）社员私有的牲畜，由社出人代放，畜主出放牧费。——也有的以幼畜作为放牧费。如：代放六、七头牛，每年向社里出一头牛犊，由社留作公共财产。（二）繁殖年龄的母畜入股，由社统一经营，劳力和畜股按适当比例分益；一般散畜由社代放，畜主出放牧费，——也有很少的社，社里只得粪肥，不要放牧费。（三）牲畜作价归社，牧业完全合作化。
    合作社初办的时候，多采用第一种办法——由社代放。这种办法较易为群众接受。采用这种办法，虽然能解决社员一定的困难问题，但是在统一经营上受很大限制。所以这样的社一般都不把牧业当作重要的经营项目，在生产上也很难进行重大的改革。
    采用第三种办法，牲畜作价归社，就可以使牧业完全合作化了。但是如果不是工作基础较强，群众觉悟较高，或具备其他有利条件，一开始就采用这个办法，不容易为群众所接受。
    在目前情况下，较适当的、可以普遍推广的，还是第二种——母畜入股，按比例分红的办法。这样作，既照顾了群众对牲畜的私有观念，又有了一定的条件实行集体经营，改进饲养管理。同时还可以积累经验，创造条件，逐步向完全社会主义的集体所有制过渡。
    实行母畜入股分红，劳力和畜股应该怎么分？各分多少才算合适？对分配比例的决定，有两种根据：一是内蒙古自治区在解放后曾在牧区普遍推行了新“苏鲁克”制（即租放牲畜的制度）。根据这种制度，自己把牲畜租给别人放，一般是畜主收回产品的60％左右，放牲畜的人分得40％左右。二是在不放“苏鲁克”的地方，也可以用算细账的办法，大致求得分配的比例。如把100头牲畜一年在牧业生产上的各项开支——包括放牧费、棚圈设备、工具、草料、接羔、保畜和挤奶所花费的劳动等，折款总算在一起，大致就是应该由合作社按劳分配的一部分。100头牲畜的产品收入中扣除全部生产开支，就是归畜主所得的一部分。
    内蒙古自治区建立最早的一个农牧业生产合作社——新牧社，就是在详细计算了三户所有牲畜的支出、收入数字的基础上，经群众反复讨论，才定出适当的分配比例的。他们具体分配办法如下表：
    分配的比例，在内蒙古的各地区也有所不同：在牲畜较多、劳力较少的地区，按劳分配的比例要高一些；在牲畜较少、劳力较多的地区，按劳分配的比例就可能略低一些。同时，建社以后随着生产的增加和社员社会主义觉悟的提高，按劳分配的比例也会逐渐增加。如新牧社在建社一年后，经过全体社员大会讨论通过，牛犊的按劳分配部分已经增加到40％以上。同时社员都感到挤奶和制作奶食品（黄油、奶豆腐）要花费很多劳动，所以把奶食品原定畜6、劳4的分配比例，改为劳6、畜4。羊羔毛（春季下的羔，秋季要剪一次毛，这时羊羔还未分配）则改为完全按劳分配。新牧社还不到两年，已经把社员私有的散畜作价归社了。他们正继续创造条件，准备进一步把母畜作价归社，转为完全社会主义的高级社。
    畜牧业从私有制过渡到社会主义的集体所有制，牧民同样要经过激烈的思想斗争。领导上要进行深入细致的宣传工作。半农、半牧区的农牧民，土地私有观念薄弱，但是对牲畜的私有观念却较强。有的还是主要靠牧业为生的牧民。有的人对牲畜深有感情，甚至拿它当儿女亲人一样看待。一般的是牲畜越多的人，顾虑、动摇越大。有的在登记入社的时候劲头很大，但是到向社里赶牲畜的时候又舍不得了。有的还要求把自己最心爱的一头牲畜留下，要给它“养老”。有的人入了社，直到生产进行一个年度，眼见牲畜比过去饲养的好，自己分的也不少，实在体会到集体经营的好处，思想上才开始坚定下来。
    帮助办社的工作人员和农、牧社的领导人员，应该懂得农牧民这种心理。要耐心地、不断地通过具体事例，向群众进行教育。不能简单从事，粗暴对待。
    当然，过份强调农牧民对牲畜的私有观念；好像一改造牧业，群众就会杀牲畜，出乱子；听到个别农、牧民因牲畜入社，思想有波动，就大惊小怪；把“慎重稳进改造牧业”的方针，变为束手束脚、稳步不前。这也是错误的。事实上，内蒙古半农、半牧区在农业上已经基本上实现了半社会主义合作化的基础上，在全国社会主义高潮的影响下，对牧业的改造是有可能做得更快、更好的。这样做，不仅会给这些地区的农、牧业生产带来很大好处，同时对内蒙古牧业区的社会主义改造也会发生有力的带动和促进作用。
