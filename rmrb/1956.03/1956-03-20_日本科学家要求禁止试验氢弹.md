Xinhua News Agency, Kyoto, 18th: Sixty prominent Japanese physicists, including Hideki Yukawa, passed a statement on March 17th demanding a ban on the testing and use of atomic and hydrogen bombs. The statement was adopted at a meeting held at Kyoto University to welcome British physicist Professor Powell's visit to Japan.

The statement said, "We firmly demand that the United States stop the hydrogen bomb tests scheduled to be held in the Pacific region in April. These tests not only threaten navigation safety and fisheries in the Pacific but also pose unforeseen harm to human health."

Powell expressed full support for the statement at the meeting. He said that he opposed all types of nuclear weapons.

The Japanese physicists will submit this statement to the World Federation of Scientific Workers conference to be held in Beijing.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: Prominent Japanese scientists held a meeting in Tokyo on the evening of the 12th and decided to launch a broad campaign at home and abroad to support the statement issued last July by eight world-renowned scientists, including British philosopher Bertrand Russell, calling for a ban on atomic weapons and atomic warfare. According to reports presented at the meeting, more than 200 Japanese scientists have expressed their support for the movement.

Hideki Yukawa, one of the signatories of Russell's statement, is one of the initiators of this movement. He said at the meeting, "I firmly believe that science is not meant to bring destruction to mankind but must be used to increase happiness."

The meeting decided to ask individuals and groups abroad to cooperate in launching this movement.

    日本科学家要求禁止试验氢弹
    据新华社18日讯　京都消息：日本汤川秀树等六十位著名的物理学家，三月十七日通过了一项要求禁止试验和使用原子弹和氢弹的声明。这个声明是他们在京都大学举行的一个欢迎英国著名物理学家鲍威尔访问日本的会议上通过的。
    声明说，我们坚决要求美国停止将在四月里在太平洋地区举行的氢弹试验。这种试验不仅威胁太平洋上的航海安全和水产业，并且会对人类的健康有不测的损害。
    鲍威尔在会上表示完全支持这个声明。他说，他反对一切类型的核子武器。
    日本物理学家们将把这项声明提交给将在北京举行会议的世界科学工作者协会。
    据新华讯社　东京消息：日本的著名科学家们十二日晚间在东京举行会议，决定今后在国内和国外广泛展开运动，支持去年七月间由英国哲学家罗素等八位世界著名科学家发表的关于要求禁止原子武器和原子战争的声明。根据在会上发表的报告，已经有二百多名日本科学家表示支持这个运动。
    罗素等人的声明的签字者之一、日本物理学家汤川秀树是这个运动的发起人之一。他在会上说，我坚信，科学不是为了给人类带来毁灭，而是必须用来增加幸福。
    会议决定要求国外的个人和团体合作展开这个运动。
