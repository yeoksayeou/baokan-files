Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 4th. More than 6,500 “husband and wife shops” in Shanghai, dealing in cigarettes, groceries, and liquor and distributed in small streets and alleys, are operating on a consignment and sales basis after the implementation of public-private partnerships.

After these "husband and wife shops" implemented consignment and sales, they maintained their original business characteristics, and the business enthusiasm of the small owners also increased. The 33 cigarette and grocery stores in Xian Gua Street and Wang Yun Road in the Yimiao District generally still maintain about 200 kinds of commodities, and transactions below five cents account for more than two-thirds of the number of transactions. The credit sales relationship between small shops and old customers is still maintained. The business hours of these stores are still the same as before. Chen Hezhang, the small owner of the Chen Hezhang Tobacco Shop in Yulin District, and his family take turns working, and the business hours are from 6 am to 11 pm, which is convenient for vendors catching the early market and workers doing night work to buy things. Some stores also use small holes opened in the door panels to receive customers who knock on the door to buy things in the middle of the night. After many "husband and wife shops" implemented consignment sales of major commodities, the small owners added some new varieties of inexpensive products according to the needs of local residents with the funds freed up. In February, the turnover of all consignment stores increased by 30% to 100% compared with January, and the income of small owners also increased accordingly.

The Shanghai Municipal Company of the China Monopoly Business Corporation is establishing district stores for public-private joint venture retail stores for cigarettes, groceries, and liquor in various districts, and is preparing to establish management committees by region to guide and help these "husband and wife shops" improve their business management.

    上海六千多家“夫妻商店”
    在公私合营后以经销代销方式经营
    据新华社上海4日电  上海市卷烟杂货业和酒业分布在小街小巷的6，500多户“夫妻商店”，在公私合营以后以经销、代销方式经营。
    这些“夫妻商店”实行经销、代销以后，保持了原有的经营特色，小业主的经营积极性也提高了。邑庙区咸瓜街和蓬莱区望云路一带的33家卷烟杂货商店，经营的商品一般仍保持在200多种左右，五分钱以下的交易占交易次数的三分之二以上。小商店和老顾客的赊销关系也仍然保持。这些商店的营业时间还是和以前一样。榆林区陈和章烟店的小业主和他的家属，采取交替上班的办法，营业时间从清晨6时到晚上11时，便利赶早市的摊贩和做夜工的工人买东西。有的商店还利用门板上开的小洞，接待半夜叫门买东西的顾客。许多“夫妻商店”实行主要商品代销以后，小业主又根据当地居民需要，用腾出来的资金添置了一些价格低廉的新品种。2月份，所有代销店的营业额比1月份增加三成到一倍，小业主的收入也因而增加。
    中国专卖事业公司上海市公司正在各区设立公私合营卷烟杂货和酒业零售商店的区店，并且准备按地段成立经营管理委员会，分片指导和帮助这些“夫妻商店”改善经营管理。
