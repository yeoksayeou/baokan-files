    Li Qingzhen, a mining worker at the Nanfen Open-pit Iron Mine in Benxi, broke his own record of 527 tons of ore mined daily on the 24th, with 600 tons of ore mined on February 29th. Since December of last year, Li Qingzhen has used his innovative mining methods to continuously set three new records for daily ore production.
