The International Women's Movement Forges Ahead
Sun Mei

This year's "March 8th" International Women's Day marks a further strengthening of the friendship, understanding, and unity among women of all countries, and also celebrates the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Women's International Democratic Federation (WIDF). All peace-loving and justice-upholding people are watching with satisfaction the glorious record of the international women's movement under the leadership and organization of the WIDF over the past decade. From the day it was founded in 1945, the WIDF has been tirelessly fighting for lasting world peace, women's rights, and the survival and happiness of children. Under the banner of peace and social progress, it has consistently adhered to the policy of uniting all women—regardless of political views, beliefs, nationality, or race—to fight together, enabling an increasingly broad and numerous number of women to participate in this struggle. At the time of the founding of the Women's International Democratic Federation, it united 80 million women from 40 countries; today, it has united more than 200 million women from 80 countries. Since the establishment of the WIDF, four large-scale conferences have been held, with each conference having more extensive participation than the last. The 1952 International Conference for the Defense of Children was attended by more than 550 delegates from 64 countries, while the World Congress of Mothers held last July was attended by more than 1,000 delegates from 66 countries. Representatives attending the World Congress of Mothers came from countries with different systems, with different political and religious beliefs, and different occupations and social statuses. Nearly half of the delegates—more than 650 people—had never attended any international conferences before. Moreover, the World Congress of Mothers received support from many women and women's groups that did not participate in the conference. Women's organizations and prominent women from 79 countries wrote articles in support of the conference or sent congratulations to the conference. The conference received more than 2,000 congratulatory telegrams and messages from various countries, making it a conference that reflected the voices of mothers around the world.

Under the organization and leadership of the Women's International Democratic Federation, women have demonstrated an increasingly high level of political activism in the struggle against war and aggression, for lasting world peace, against colonialism, and for national independence, freedom, and democracy. The international women's peace ranks are roaring loudly in the growing world people's peace movement; women are playing an increasingly important role in advocating the peaceful settlement of international disputes and promoting the relaxation of international tensions.

Women accounted for half of the hundreds of millions of people who signed international documents such as the Stockholm Appeal for the Prohibition of Atomic Weapons, the appeal for the five major powers to conclude a peace pact, and the World Peace Council's "Appeal to the People of the World" against atomic war. Most of the more than 33 million signatures collected in Japan against atomic weapons were women's signatures or were collected by women. The World Congress of Mothers held in Lausanne, Switzerland, last July was a new sign of the international women's struggle to defend peace. More than 1,000 representatives of mothers from various countries discussed the most pressing issues in the international situation at the conference. The congress's declaration, its letter to the heads of government of the four powers, and its appeal to the United Nations fully expressed the lofty aspirations of millions of mothers around the world to ease international tensions and promote international cooperation.

In the past year, the international women's movement has made new progress. Last June, the first Japanese National Mothers' Congress was held in Tokyo with the participation of more than 2,000 mothers from various regions and strata and representatives of more than 60 women's groups, discussing various issues related to safeguarding women's rights and protecting children. The congress resolution called on the government to increase social insurance and education expenses, oppose layoffs and unemployment, and ban films and comics that have a bad influence on children. With the support of the French Women's Union, women in Paris held a rally on June 19 last year to oppose West German remilitarization, strive for disarmament, and defend peace. The British Women's Co-operative Guild convened a national peace conference last February with the participation of more than 2,000 representatives, and resolved to demand that the British government promote an agreement on disarmament issues and restore German unification by peaceful means. In Italy, 100,000 female tobacco workers won wage increases and a wage adjustment system based on prices in the renegotiation of their collective contract. The Third Conference on American Working Women's Issues, held last June, decided to demand the passage of laws guaranteeing equal pay for equal work for men and women, and the conference called on women to strengthen the struggle for peace. Last September, more than 1,000 female worker representatives from all walks of life in Cyprus held a meeting in Nicosia, demanding improvements in the working conditions of female workers, striving for the immediate implementation of social insurance for female workers, and respecting their freedom to join trade unions.

1956 will be a year in which women around the world continue to strengthen unity and achieve more significant achievements for the cause of peace and the welfare of women and children. The first World Conference of Women Workers, which will be held this June, has already received enthusiastic support from working women in various countries. This conference will make a major contribution to improving the economic and political rights of female workers and further mobilizing women to participate in the struggle to defend peace.

In the struggle of women in various countries to defend peace and protect the rights of women and children, women in the Soviet Union and the people's democracies are at the forefront. Women in our country have consistently responded warmly to the call of the WIDF, actively participated in various activities, and worked tirelessly with women around the world to defend peace and protect women and children. In the high tide of the national socialist revolution, women in our country, together with the people of the whole country, actively participate in the construction work in industry, agriculture, culture, and education, strive to learn and master new technologies, and contribute their strength to defending world peace. Women in our country attach particular importance to expanding and strengthening political, economic, and cultural ties between the people of various countries. The friendly exchanges between women in our country and women in various countries around the world are increasing year by year. In 1955, representatives of women's groups in our country went abroad to visit and participate in international conferences on 34 occasions, with a total of 252 people going abroad. At the same time, about 220 people in 53 women's delegations from 31 countries and 1 international organization were invited to visit our country. In the past year, the friendly relations between women in our country and women in Asian countries such as India, Pakistan, and Japan have made particularly significant progress. The friendly exchanges between women of various countries are not only an important link in strengthening friendly relations between peoples, but also play an extremely important role in the struggle to strive for lasting peace and promote the further relaxation of the international situation.

    大步前进的国际妇女运动
    孙梅
    今年的“三八”国际妇女节是标志了各国妇女之间的友谊、谅解和团结进一步加强的日子，也是庆祝国际民主妇联成立十周年的日子。一切爱好和平和主持正义的人，都以满意的心情注视着十年来，在国际民主妇联的领导和组织下，国际妇女运动的光辉的记录。从1945年成立那一天起，国际民主妇联就为世界持久和平、妇女权利、孩子们的生存和幸福而进行着不倦的斗争。在和平和社会进步的大旗下，它一贯坚持了团结一切妇女——不分政治观点、信仰、民族和种族，——共同进行斗争的活动方针，使越来越广泛、越来越众多的妇女参加到这个斗争中来。在国际民主妇女联合会成立的时候，它团结有40个国家的8，000万妇女，今天它已经团结了80个国家的两亿多妇女。在国际民主妇联成立后，举行了四次规模巨大的会议，参加会议的成员一次比一次更为广泛。参加1952年国际保卫儿童会议的有64个国家的550多位代表，而去年7月举行的世界母亲大会则有66个国家的1，000多位代表参加。参加世界母亲大会的代表来自不同制度的国家，有着不同的政治信仰和宗教信仰，不同的职业和社会地位。将近半数代表——650多人——过去从未参加任何国际会议。不仅如此，世界母亲大会还得到许多没有参加大会的妇女和妇女团体的支持。79个国家的妇女组织和知名妇女撰文支持大会或向大会致贺。大会收到来自各国的2，000多封贺电和贺词，使这次大会成了反映全世界母亲呼声的大会。
    在国际民主妇女联合会的组织和领导下，妇女们在反对战争和侵略，争取世界持久和平，反对殖民主义，争取民族独立、自由和民主的斗争中，表现出了日益高昂的政治积极性。国际妇女的和平队伍，在声势壮大的世界人民和平运动中，发出着响亮的吼声；在主张用和平协商方式解决国际争端、促进国际局势缓和的斗争中，妇女们已经起着越来越大的作用。
    在关于禁止原子武器的斯德哥尔摩宣言、要求五大国缔结和平公约的呼吁书以及关于反对原子战争的世界和平理事会“告全世界人民书”等这些国际文件上签名的亿万人民中，就有一半是妇女。在日本已征集的3，300多万个反对原子武器的签名中，大部分是妇女的签名或妇女所征集的。去年7月在瑞士洛桑召开的世界母亲大会，是国际妇女保卫和平斗争的新的标志。1，000多名各国母亲的代表在这次大会上讨论了国际局势中最迫切的问题。在大会的宣言和它给四国政府首脑会议的信以及致联合国呼吁书中，充分表达了全世界千百万母亲的对缓和国际紧张局势和促进国际合作的崇高愿望。
    在过去的一年内，国际妇女运动有了新的发展。去年6月在东京举行了有2，000多各地区各阶层的母亲和60多个妇女团体代表参加的日本全国第一次母亲大会，讨论了维护妇女权利和保卫儿童的各项问题。大会决议要求政府增加社会保险费用和教育费用、反对解雇和失业、禁止对儿童有坏影响的电影和漫画。在法兰西妇女联盟的支持下，巴黎妇女在去年6月19日举行集会反对西德重新军国主义化，争取裁减军备，保卫和平。英国妇女合作社公会去年2月召开了有两千多代表参加的全国和平大会，决议要求英国政府促进裁军问题的协议，用和平方法恢复德国的统一。在意大利，10万名烟草女工在重订集体合同时赢得了增加工资和按物价调整工资制。去年6月间举行的美国劳动妇女问题第三次大会，决定要求通过保证男女同工同酬的法律，大会并号召妇女加强争取和平的斗争。去年9月，塞浦路斯1，000多名各行各业的女工代表在尼可悉亚举行了会议，要求改善女工的劳动条件，争取立即实行对女工的社会保险和尊重她们加入工会的自由。
    1956年将是全世界妇女继续加强团结，为和平事业和妇女儿童福利取得更为显著成就的一年。今年6月间将要召开的第一次世界女工会议，已经得到各国劳动妇女的热烈支持。这个会议将对争取改善女工的经济和政治权利和进一步发动妇女参加保卫和平的斗争作出重大的贡献。
    在各国妇女保卫和平、保卫妇女儿童的权利的斗争中，苏联和各人民民主国家的妇女站在最前列。我国妇女一贯热烈地响应国际民主妇联的号召，积极参加各项活动，同全世界妇女一道，为保卫和平、保卫妇女儿童而不懈地努力。在全国社会主义革命的高潮中我国妇女和全国人民一道，积极参加工农业以及文化教育方面的建设工作，努力学习，掌握新的技术，在保卫世界和平上，贡献自己的力量。我国妇女特别重视扩大和加强各国人民间的政治、经济、文化联系。我国妇女同世界各国妇女的友好往来一年年地增加。1955年，我国妇女团体的代表出国访问和参加国际会议的共有34次，出国人数达252人。同时，31个国家和1个国际组织的53个妇女代表团约220人曾应邀访问过我国。在过去一年内，我国妇女同印度、巴基斯坦和日本等亚洲国家妇女的友好联系，有了特别显著的发展。各国妇女的友好往来，不但是加强人民之间友好联系的重要一环，而且在争取持久和平、促进国际局势进一步缓和的斗争中有极重要的作用。
