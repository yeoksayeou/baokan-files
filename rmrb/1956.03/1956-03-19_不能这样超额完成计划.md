This is Not How to Exceed the Plan
    By Our Reporter Liu Heng

    Baotou was very lively on the afternoon of February 1st! Workers and family members from 11 local state-owned and joint state-private factories carried charts, beat gongs, and set off firecrackers to report good news to the Baotou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Baotou Municipal People's Committee, and the Baotou Municipal Trade Union. This was because these 11 factories had all exceeded their January production targets.

    Among the reporting teams, the workers from the automobile repair factory were the most eye-catching. They sat in several large trucks, with many large red flags fluttering on the trucks. The words "Good News" were written on the front of the trucks, and a large chart showing the over-fulfillment of the January task was also posted. As the trucks passed through the streets, pedestrians stopped to watch and secretly praised: "What an impressive team!" News reporters also took photos of them, which were published in the Baotou Daily.

    However, upon examining the reasons why the automobile repair factory had completed its task ahead of schedule, it was immediately discovered that the factory had exceeded its target by working overtime. In the second half of January, they worked 3,000 extra man-hours. Some people worked all night, and some worked continuously for thirty or forty hours. Repairman Zhang Yingxue had not rested for three Sundays in a row. From January 28th to 30th, he worked continuously from 7:00 in the morning until 11:00 in the evening. On the 31st, he worked from 7:00 in the morning until 8:00 the next morning.

    The factory's leaders also disregarded product quality and falsely reported achievements. According to state regulations for product statistics, vehicles inspected and completed in February should not be counted in the January product completion figures. However, this factory rushed to repair nine vehicles all night on January 31st, and even though the completion seal was not stamped until February 2nd, they still counted them in the January figures. Among these nine vehicles, six were not repaired properly, and the main repair work was carried out in February. One vehicle even continued to be repaired for 122 hours, and the leaders instructed the workers to record the man-hours for this vehicle on the repair hours of other vehicles.

    Amidst the cheers of completing the plan ahead of schedule, leading organs should maintain a clear head and thoroughly understand the true situation of each factory and mine. If they discover factories like the Baotou Automobile Repair Factory, they should sternly criticize them and help them correct their shortcomings, rather than condoning their erroneous practices and allowing them to boast and exaggerate their "achievements."

### 不能这样超额完成计划

    不能这样超额完成计划
    本报记者　刘衡
    2月1日下午，包头市好热闹呀！有11个地方国营和公私合营厂的职工和家属们，抬着图表，敲锣、放炮，向中共包头市委、包头市人民委员会和包头市工会报捷。因为这11个工厂都超额完成了1月份的生产任务。
    在报捷队伍中，要算汽车修配厂的职工们最惹人注意了。他们坐着几辆大汽车，汽车上飘着好多面大红旗，汽车头上写着“捷报”两个大字，还贴了一张超额完成1月份任务的大图表。当汽车穿过街头，行人都停步观看，暗暗称赞：“这支队伍好威武呀！”新闻记者还给他们拍了照，把照片登在包头日报上。
    可是，研究一下汽车修配厂提前完成任务的原因，立刻就发现：原来这个厂是用加班加点的方法超额完成任务的。1月份下半月，加班3，000个工时。有的人通宵加班，有的人连续工作三、四十小时。修理工张迎学已经3个星期天没休息了，在1月28—30日，接连三天从早晨7点钟一直加班到晚上11点。到31日，他又从早晨7点加班到第二天早晨8点。
    这个厂的领导人员还不顾产品质量，假报成绩。根据国家对产品统计的规定，2月份检验竣工的车辆不应该算在1月份产品完成数内。可是，这个厂在1月31日通宵赶修了9辆汽车，到2月2日才盖竣工章，他们也算在1月份的账上。在这9辆汽车中，就有6辆没有修好，主要部分的修理工作到2月份才进行。有一辆汽车竟继续修理了122小时，领导上就叫工人把这辆车的修车工时记在其他车的修理工时中。
    在提前完成计划的捷报声中，领导机关应该头脑清醒地深入了解各厂矿的真实情况。如果发现像包头汽车修配厂这样的工厂，就应该严正地批评他们，帮助他们改正缺点；而不应该纵容他们这种错误做法，让他们吹嘘和夸耀自己的“成绩”。
