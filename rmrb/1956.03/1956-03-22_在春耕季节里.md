    In the Spring Ploughing Season
    New Cultivated Land in Yunnan Begins Sowing
    More than 1 million mu of wasteland have been reclaimed in seven special districts, including Qujing in Yunnan Province. The Qujing Special District alone has completed its plan to reclaim 250,000 mu. Farmers are sowing grains and cash crops on the reclaimed wasteland.
    At the same time, Yunnan Province is using valuable economic tree species and crops such as tea trees, hemp seeds, and mulberry trees to green the barren mountains. Yiliang County in Qujing Special District has planted 5,000 jin of tea seeds on barren mountains this year. Yongfeng Township plans to plant 2,000 mu of tea this year and has already planted 1,000 mu. A greening movement to plant mulberry trees and castor beans to feed silkworms has also begun.

    The Broad Masses of Peasants in Anhui Store Water to Prevent Drought
    Anhui Province has made great achievements in its water storage and drought prevention campaign. More than 6 million male and female commune members have been involved in the drought resistance movement. The province has built more than 26,000 river dams, dug more than 71,000 ditches, and sunk more than 17,000 wells. The water stored in the Anqing and Lu'an Special Districts can supply 70% to 80% of the area for rice transplanting in these two districts. After widespread spring rains on the 19th, all parts of the province are seizing the time to rush-plant spring corn.

    Farmers on the Shores of Dongting Lake Launch Spring Ploughing Competition
    The first spring after the realization of agricultural cooperation in the Dongting Lake Plain of Hunan Province, farmers generally began spring ploughing ten days earlier than last year.
    In the vast fields, agricultural production cooperatives are conducting production competitions between various farming areas and production teams to win red flags. In places where the red flags are flying, male and female commune members are happily engaged in an agricultural operation they call "assembly line operation." In a rice paddy, at the same time, one group of people draw water for irrigation, while another group plows and harrows the field. After the girls evenly spread the fertilizer into the field, oxen drag a clattering "trampling rake" across, pressing the fertilizer into the mud. Then, there is another plowing and harrowing. The members of the Shengtian Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fudong Township, Yuanjiang County, using this method of division of labor and cooperation, plow more than 300 mu of rice paddies every day, quickly and well, and the difficulty of insufficient cattle is also solved.

    Comprehensive Spring Ploughing in the Miscellaneous Grain Planting Areas of Northern Jiangsu
    The areas in northern Jiangsu Province that plant miscellaneous grains have comprehensively begun spring ploughing. All parts of the Xuzhou Special District are carrying out spring ploughing, fine harrowing, and moisture preservation work. Of the 8 million mu of spring fields in the Huaiyin Special District, more than 75% have been plowed once, and some have been plowed twice. Generally, fine ploughing and harrowing and shallow ploughing and multiple harrowing have been achieved.
    The farmers in these two areas are launching a large-scale high-yield movement to change the farming system. Some members of the agricultural production cooperatives have changed the habit of not dredging stagnant silt and not accumulating urine fertilizer for thousands of years. According to incomplete statistics from seven counties in the Huaiyin Special District, the accumulation of farm manure and the dredging of river silt alone amounts to more than 820 million loads, averaging 800 loads per household. A mass well-digging movement has also unfolded on the Huaihai Plain. The Xuzhou Special District has already dug and is digging 34,441 wells. Many places have begun to use the spring water from the new wells to irrigate the land. The agricultural production cooperatives have also selected and exchanged a large number of improved varieties for spring sowing.
    Jiangxi Cultivates Large Numbers of New-Style Seedling Fields
    Jiangxi Province has cultivated a large number of new-style seedling fields this year. All the seedling fields prepared in the Southern Jiangxi District this year are new-style seedling fields. More than 50% of the seeds are "Nante No.," and the rest are also improved varieties that have been successfully planted in the Southern Jiangxi District over the years. More than 90% of the early rice seedling fields in various counties have also been prepared.
    Many agricultural production cooperatives in the Northern Jiangxi area are actively organizing seedling fields. All 505 mu of seedling fields organized by 131 agricultural production cooperatives in Duchang County are located in fields with good water sources, sufficient sunshine, and fertile soil.
    Hebei Widely Imparts Agricultural Technology
    Hebei Province is carrying out mass activities to impart agricultural technology in conjunction with spring ploughing production. Various localities plan to have 10 million members of agricultural production cooperatives receive technical instruction before spring ploughing and sowing. At present, according to incomplete statistics, more than 83,000 technical backbones, such as deputy directors of agricultural production cooperatives, agricultural technicians, production team leaders, and group leaders, have been trained through short-term training courses. In 22 counties such as Leting and Anci, more than 807,000 commune members have been taught through technical backbones.

    在春耕季节里
    云南新垦荒地开始播种
    云南省曲靖等七个专区开荒一百多万亩。仅曲靖专区已完成了开荒25万亩的计划。农民们在已开垦的荒地上播种了谷物和经济作物。
    同时，云南省采用茶树、麻子、桑树等有价值的经济树种和作物绿化荒山。曲靖专区的宜良县今年已在荒山上种下了五千斤茶种。永丰乡计划今年种茶二千亩，现在已种下一千亩。种植桑树和蓖麻来喂蚕的绿化运动也已开始。（本报驻昆明记者）
    安徽广大农民蓄水防旱
    安徽省蓄水防旱抗旱运动有了很大成绩。投入抗旱运动的男女社员已有六百多万人。全省已经拦河打坝二万六千多道，开挖沟渠七万一千多条，打井一万七千多眼。安庆、六安两专区所蓄的水，已能供两专区水稻播种面积的百分之七、八十的水稻插秧用水。十九日普降春雨以后，全省各地正抓紧时间抢种春玉米。

    洞庭湖滨农民展开春耕竞赛
    湖南省洞庭湖滨平原实现农业合作化以后的第一个春天，农民们一般比去年提早十天开始春耕。
    辽阔的田野里，农业生产合作社的各个耕作区和生产队间开展起争夺红旗的生产竞赛。在红旗招展的地方，男女社员们高兴地进行着一种被他们叫做“流水作业法”的农事操作。他们在一片稻田里，在同一时间内，一组人车水灌田，另一组人犁田和耙田。当姑娘们均匀地把肥料撒到田里之后，耕牛拖着一种哒哒作响的“踏耙”滚过去，肥料就被压进泥里。接着，又是一次犁耙。沅江县福东乡胜天农业生产合作社的社员们采用这种分工合作的办法，每天要耕三百多亩稻田，耕得又快又好，耕牛不足的困难也解决了。　（据新华社讯）
    江苏北部种杂粮地区全面春耕
    江苏省北部种植杂粮的地区全面开始春耕。徐州专区各地正在进行春耕、细耙和保墒工作。淮阴专区八百万亩春田，已有75％以上耕过头遍，有的已耕两遍，一般都做到了精耕细耙和浅耕多耙。
    这两个地区的农民正开展一个大规模改变耕作制度的高额丰产运动。有的农业生产合作社的社员们改变了几千年来不捞汪淤、不积尿肥的习惯。据淮阴专区七个县的不完全统计，单积厩肥、挖河淤就有八亿二千多万挑，平均每户积肥八百挑。群众性的打井运动也在淮海平原上展开，徐州专区已经打好和正在打的井有34，441眼。很多地方开始利用新井的泉水浇地。各农业生产合作社还为春播选换了大批良种。
    江西培育大量新式秧田
    江西省今年培育了大量新式秧田。赣南区今年已做好的秧田，全部是新式秧田，种子有50％以上是“南特号”，其余的也都是赣南区历年种植取得成效的良种。各县早稻秧田也已做好90％以上。
    赣北地区许多农业生产合作社积极整理秧田。都昌县131个农业生产合作社整好的505亩秧田，全部都做在水源好、阳光足、土地肥沃的田里。
    河北广泛传授农业技术
    河北省结合春耕生产开展群众性的传授农业技术活动。各地计划在春耕播种前使一千万名农业生产合作社社员得到技术传授。目前，据不完全统计，各地通过短期训练班已经训练了八万三千多名农业生产合作社副社长、农业技术员、生产队长和组长等技术骨干力量。乐亭、安次等22个县，通过技术骨干已经传授了八十万七千多名社员。
