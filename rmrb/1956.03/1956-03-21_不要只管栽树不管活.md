    Don't Just Plant Trees Without Ensuring They Live
    In Cheng Guan District of Wugang County, Hunan Province, a recent afforestation effort saw six thousand newly planted saplings blown down by a gust of wind. The affiliated elementary school of Wugang Normal School planted over 20,000 saplings, but half of them died shortly after. From December 4th to 28th last year, Shangzhai Township in Luxi County, Hunan Province, afforested over 1,200 mu of land, achieving rapid progress but with poor quality. A large portion of the Chinese fir saplings were planted under dense tung trees, which not only prevented the saplings from growing but also damaged the roots of some tung trees. According to a preliminary inspection by the forestry department of Hunan Province, similar situations exist in various places.
    In afforestation areas, it is necessary not only to vigorously publicize the significance of greening the motherland and greening the hometown, but also to publicize planting methods, specifically imparting planting techniques to the masses, and ensuring that the planted trees survive.

    不要只管栽树不管活
    湖南省武冈县城关区有段地方最近造林之后，一阵风就刮倒了六千多株栽好的树苗。武冈师范学校附属小学造林两万多株，不久即死了一半。湖南省泸溪县上寨乡从去年十二月四日到二十八日造林一千二百多亩，速度很快，但是质量很差，有一大部杉树苗是栽在稠密的油桐树底下，不但这些树苗不能生长，而且还挖坏了一些油桐树的根。据湖南省林业部门初步检查，各地都有类似情况。
    在造林地区，不但要大力宣传绿化祖国绿化家乡的意义，而且要宣传栽树方法，向群众具体传授栽树技术，保证栽树要栽活。
