Accusation of the British Government

The British authorities in Hong Kong announced in a public statement on March 12 that the Chiang Kai-shek group's F-86 fighter plane that landed in Hong Kong on January 31, and the personnel on board, should be allowed to return to Taiwan, and that the personnel on board have already gone to Taiwan. This practice of the British government, which violates international norms and is very unfriendly to the Chinese people, cannot but arouse great indignation among the Chinese people.

Hong Kong is an international port near the Chinese border, yet the Chiang Kai-shek group has been able to both sabotage the Indian "Kashmir" plane there, assassinate members of the Chinese delegation, and use that port as a refuge for military sabotage activities against the Chinese people. This cannot but arouse the serious attention of the Chinese people and those who care about Asian peace and security.

The Chiang Kai-shek group's F-86 fighter plane was harassing the Chinese mainland when it was chased by the People's Liberation Army and fled to Hong Kong. After this incident occurred, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately notified the British Chargé d'Affaires, requesting the British authorities in Hong Kong to detain the Chiang aircraft and its personnel. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also expressed its belief that the British authorities would not allow Hong Kong to be used as a base and refuge for military sabotage activities against China. However, this legitimate request of the Chinese government was not valued by the British government.

The British authorities stated in the public statement that they had no intention of allowing Hong Kong to be used as a base for hostile activities against anyone. However, it did not mention the fact that this military aircraft had carried out hostile activities against China, describing the aircraft as if it had unintentionally flown into Hong Kong from some no man's land. After intentionally avoiding this key fact, it vaguely invoked so-called international conventions and publicly announced that the Chiang aircraft and its personnel, which had carried out hostile activities against the Chinese people, should be allowed to go to Taiwan, and that the Chiang aircraft personnel had already been sent to Taiwan. In that case, people have reason to question: What is the true meaning of the British side's statement that it has no intention of allowing Hong Kong to be used as a base for hostile activities against anyone? This contradictory action of the British government can only be regarded as actually condoning the Chiang Kai-shek group's use of Hong Kong to carry out hostile activities against the Chinese people and threaten China's security. This is what the Chinese people will never tolerate.

The Chiang Kai-shek group's war activities against the Chinese people have not ceased, and its war sabotage activities are intensifying with the assistance of the United States. It not only frequently sends aircraft to harass our mainland and coast, shells mainland ports, and loots coastal fishermen and merchant ships, but also frequently targets its military sabotage activities at British merchant ships. According to incomplete information, in recent years, nearly 60 British ships have been intercepted, strafed, searched, robbed, and shelled by the Chiang army. In the first half of March alone, at least two British merchant ships have been bombarded by the Chiang army. Under such circumstances, the aircraft and personnel of the Chiang army engaged in military sabotage activities can actually receive actual condoning from the British authorities in Hong Kong. This is not only intolerable to the Chinese people, but also, we believe, is what the British people will never allow.

The Chinese people fully support the serious protest and demands put forward by our government on March 16. The Chiang aircraft remaining in Hong Kong must be detained. If this request is ignored, if it is thought that the Chinese people will tolerate the Chiang army's military sabotage activities finding a hiding place in Hong Kong, then the British government alone will be responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom.

### 责问英国政府

    责问英国政府
    香港英国当局3月12日的公报宣布：1月31日在香港降落的蒋介石集团F—86型战斗机和机上人员应当获准返回台湾，而且机上人员已经去了台湾。英国政府这种违背国际惯例、对中国人民很不友好的作法，不能不引起中国人民的重大愤慨。
    香港是近在中国边沿的国际港口，蒋氏集团竟然既能够在那里破坏印度“克什米尔”号飞机，对中国代表团人员进行谋杀，又能够利用那个港口作为对中国人民进行军事破坏活动的逃难所。这尤其不能不引起中国人民和关心亚洲和平和安全的人们的严重注意。
    蒋介石集团的F—86型战斗机，是在窜入中国大陆进行骚扰，经我人民解放军飞机追击后逃往香港的。这一事件发生后，我国外交部立即通知英国代办，要求香港英国当局将这架蒋机和机上人员予以扣留。外交部并且表示相信英国当局不会容许香港被利用为对中国进行军事破坏活动的基地和逃避的场所。但是中国政府的这一正当要求竟然没有得到英国政府的重视。
    英国当局在公报中表示无意听任香港被利用为对任何人进行敌对活动的基地。但是它却只字不提这架军用飞机对中国进行敌对活动的事实，把这架飞机说成好像是从什么无人地带的上空无意飞入香港似的。公报在有意地回避了这个关键事实之后，就含糊其词地借口所谓国际惯例，公然宣布这架对中国人民进行敌对活动的蒋机和机上人员应获准去台湾，并且已经把蒋机人员遣去台湾。既然如此，人们就有理由质问：英国方面关于无意让香港被利用为对任何人进行敌对活动的基地的这一声明，它的真实意义究竟何在？英国政府这种言行相违的行动只能被认为是实际纵容蒋介石集团利用香港对中国人民进行敌对活动，威胁中国的安全这是中国人民决不能容忍的。
    蒋介石集团反对中国人民的战争活动并未终止，它的战争破坏活动在美国的协助之下正在变本加厉。它不但经常派遣飞机骚扰我国大陆和沿海、炮击大陆港口、劫掠沿海渔民和商船，而且经常把它的军事破坏行动针对着英国的往来商船。根据不完全的材料，几年来英国船只遭受蒋军拦截、扫射、搜查、劫走和炮击已近60艘。仅仅在三月的上半个月内，至少已经有两只英国商轮受到蒋军轰击。在这种情形之下，蒋军从事军事破坏活动的飞机和人员竟能受到英国当局在香港的实际纵容，这不但中国人民不能容忍，而且，我们相信，也是英国人民所决不能容许的。
    中国人民全力支持我国政府3月16日提出的严重抗议和要求。留在香港的蒋机必须予以扣留。如果这个要求遭到忽视，如果以为中国人民将容忍蒋军的军事破坏活动在香港得到藏身之处，那么，由此引起的一切后果只能由英国政府负责。
