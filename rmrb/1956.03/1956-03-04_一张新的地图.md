A New Map
Zhou Jun

On the morning of December 24, 1955, in front of the office of the Oriental Agricultural Production Cooperative in Guantianfan Township, Liu'an County, Anhui Province, a 1:10,000 scale topographic map of the entire township was spread out on a table. Surrounding the map were many people, including Chen Liangtao, a member of the Chengnan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party; Zhang Shiying, the township head; and Ma Jiaju and Hu Chuanjin, the deputy directors of the Oriental Agricultural Production Cooperative, as well as a Chengnan District Construction Committee member. Some held red fountain pens, some held blue fountain pens, and some simply extended their rough, hard fingers, seriously circling and drawing on the map like commanding officers in battle.

	"This barren hill will be entirely planted with fruit trees."
	"And this side, let's make it a pig farm."

Following the direction pointed out on the map, I looked southwest and heard a chorus of labor sounds. More than 100 people, having spent nearly 3,000 workdays on 280 mu of barren hills, had already dug more than 3,000 deep pits, 4 feet wide and 3 feet deep, for planting fruit trees. Now, they were carrying thousands of dan of river mud to fill the pits, replacing the alkaline soil. According to Feng Chuandao, the fruit tree production team leader, this spring would see the red and white blossoms of 1,700 apple trees, 1,000 pear trees, and 500 peach trees blooming in unison, with butterflies and bees dancing and singing in the flowers.

Less than half a li to the southeast, a row of new thatched houses, 11 in total, had already been erected, each one spacious. This was the new-style pig farm marked with a small red circle on the map. Each house housed two sows. Two of the sows had already given birth to 10 piglets, plump and lovable. Four more were about to give birth soon. According to Hu Qingyang, the pig farming team leader, the cooperative planned to buy 30 more sows, with a plan to raise 1,000 piglets a year.

At this time, the construction committee member's red fountain pen fell again on the northwestern corner of the map and lingered there, unwilling to move. After everyone else had finished speaking, he said, "This area is the best scenic spot in the whole cooperative, truly beautiful with green mountains and clear waters. Mountains to the north, water to the west and south..."

	"No," Chen Liangtao pressed his finger to the center of the map, interrupting him, "That's too remote, not central. The scenic area is better at 'Youth Pond'. Plant weeping willows all around, build two gardens on both sides, build a pavilion next to the gardens, buy some chess and playing cards, and get two small boats for the young people to play on during their rest days. It's both central and has commemorative significance." As he spoke, he suddenly turned his face and said to several young men, "What are you doing standing here? Go dig the pond." The young men giggled and slipped away. But in the blink of an eye, more young people were standing beside us, listening with rapt attention as if hearing a mythical story, their red and dark faces filled with happy smiles. One of them, upon hearing about the gardens and small boats, was so happy he didn't know what to do, constantly nudging the person next to him, as if to say, "Listen, listen, our country, our cooperative, is arranging our young people's lives so wonderfully!"

The light rain was still falling, but no one around the map noticed the raindrops on their clothes.

	"Here is the office of the cooperative committee and the club. I think we should open a main street from here east and west, and another main street north and south, in a cross shape," someone suggested.
	"This development has many advantages, close to the transformer station for the high-voltage lines, convenient for electricity," another person echoed. Seeing that everyone had no objections, the construction committee member hurriedly used his red fountain pen to draw a cross-shaped double red line on the map.

Yes, what was there to argue about? The first building on this cross-shaped main street, the office of the cooperative committee and the club, had already been completed. To the east of the club were two new houses, the sales department of the supply and marketing cooperative, displaying the daily necessities required by the members: salt, oil, pickled fish, candy, fabrics, wool, sweaters, and daily necessities, as well as some means of production. Next to the sales department was a large accounting room, where three accountants were sitting, heads down, tapping on abacuses. Stepping out of the accounting room was the spacious club with more than 20 tables and dozens of long benches. This was the temporary classroom for more than 150 young people in the cooperative. There were two brand-new blackboards on the east and west sides. Twelve award banners hung on the walls—the glory of the entire cooperative: awarded by the People's Government of Anhui Province, awarded by the Liu'an Commissioner's Office. Recently, a new red satin award banner was added, inscribed with the eight characters "不怕困难，克服困难" [bù pà kùnnan, kèfú kùnnan] – "Fear No Difficulties, Overcome Difficulties". This was awarded by the Communist Youth League Chengnan District Committee to the 150-member youth shock brigade because they had dug more than 1,000 cubic meters of earth in 40 days of winter repairs. To the west of the club was the cooperative's clinic, where a young doctor and a female midwife were busy sorting and displaying many medicines in the cabinets.

At this time, if you turned your head to look, in front of the door was the Liu'an-Huoshan highway, with cargo trucks coming and going like shuttles, delivering steel bars and cement high-voltage power poles to both sides of the road. At the "Dajingai" high mound, construction of a power transmission transformer station had already begun. This was the reason why the person who had seconded the idea earlier said that the cross-shaped main street would have convenient electricity.

In the uppermost corner of the map, there was another small red circle. I asked a comrade what that meant. He said, "This is a small brick and tile factory that has been planned for a long time. It will be completed in 1957, and the bricks and tiles produced will be used exclusively for the members to build houses on this field"—his finger moved to the double red lines of the cross street—"Here to build a tractor station, here to build a pumping station, here to build the first farming area management office, here to build the second farming area management office..." Zhang Bomin, a cooperative cadre, used a red pen, starting from the cross street, closely following the red lines drawn by the comrades introducing the first and second farming areas, and drew a very thick red line in curves, saying, "This is a 'Forward Road', it passes through the first farming area, goes around here, and then goes to the third farming area. This is a 'Happiness Road'... This is a 'Democracy Road'..."

"The sheep farm and silkworm farm, I think they should be placed on this hill, it's both high and wide," Zhang Shiying shouted loudly. But everyone hadn't heard clearly yet. Because on the other side of the square, the deafening singing of the 150-plus youth shock brigade came:

	"From the city to the countryside, from the countryside to the city,
	The cooperative is the bridge..."

Perhaps the conductor had set the pitch too high, and after singing only a few lines, everyone's throats could no longer go higher, so there was a burst of deafening laughter. So much so that the "ding-ding" of the telephone in the office rang for a long time before people went to answer it.

"I think the sheep farm and silkworm farm should be placed next to this large fish pond, because silkworm urine and sheep manure can feed the fish, and also, on this long dyke, there is also a place to plant mulberry trees, which is convenient for raising fish and feeding silkworms," Chen Liangtao said to Hu Chuanjin, pointing to a small hill south of the cross street.

"We have all seven amplifier poles. Have you guys figured out which fields to bury them in?" a young man ran over and said.

"In short, everyone in the cooperative should be able to hear it when it's broadcast," Chen Liangtao said, still lowering his head to the map, muttering, "Where should the cattle farm be placed?"

"This is the most suitable place," Hu Chuanjin said, pointing to a spot marked as a hill.

"Lao Zhou, why don't you express your opinion? This is our socialist construction!" Lao Ma suddenly turned around and tugged at my sleeve.

Yes, since this new map was placed on the table, I had not said a word. Every time a symbol of an orchard was circled on the map, the double red lines of the cross street were drawn, the signs of new-style pig, cattle, sheep, and silkworm farms, the towering power poles and telephone poles, and the symbols of brick and tile factories and scenic spots, my heart was so excited! Three months ago, the 11 primary cooperatives in the township, although they had been established for three or four years, had made considerable progress in production, but everything marked on this map didn't even have a shadow yet. Now, after a short period of several months, the 11 primary cooperatives had merged into one advanced cooperative, and the manpower and material resources were more concentrated, opening up a broader road for developing diversified economic production. The beautiful picture of a socialist countryside, like that of the Soviet countryside, must appear! It is not in some distant place, but right before our eyes.

    一张新的地图
    周军
    1955年12月24日的上午，在安徽省六安县关田畈乡东方农业生产合作社办公室的门前，一张桌子上摆着万分之一的全乡地形图。在这张地图的四周，簇拥了许多人，其中有中共城南区委员会的委员陈良涛，有这个乡的乡长张世英，和东方农业生产合作社的副主任马家聚、胡传金。还有城南区建设委员。他们有的拿着红水钢笔，有的拿着蓝水钢笔，有的就伸出粗硬的手指，和正在作战的指挥员一样，严肃地在地图上东一划、西一圈。
    “这一片荒岗上，全栽上果木。”
    “这一边呢，就作养猪场吧。”
    我顺着地图指出的方向，向西南一看，听到那里传来一阵劳动的呼声。那里有100多人，在280亩荒岗上，花了近3，000个劳动日，已经挖成了3，000多个4尺宽3尺深栽果树的深坑，现在正把成千担的河泥担到这个深坑里，换去原来的碱土。据果木生产队长封传道说，在今年的春天，就可以看到1，700棵苹果树，1，000棵梨子树，500棵桃树的红花、白花齐放，蝴蝶和蜜蜂将在花丛中飞舞歌唱。
    在不到半华里的东南方，已经竖立起一排新的草屋，共有11间，每一间都很宽阔。这就是地图上那个标着小红圈的新式的养猪场。每一间屋里睡着两只老母猪。其中有两只母猪已生了10只小猪，肉滚滚的讨人喜欢。还有4只也很快就要生小猪了。据养猪队长胡清洋告诉我：社里还准备再买30只老母猪，一年计划生1，000只小猪。
    这时候，建设委员手里的红水钢笔，又落到地图的最西北的一个角上，而且一直恋恋不舍地不愿移动，他等别人讲完了话，说，“这个场子是全社最好的风景区，真是山青水秀，北边是山，西边、南边是水……。”
    “不，”陈良涛把手指捺到中心的一个地方，打断他的话头，“那里太偏了，不是中心。风景区还是在‘青年塘’好。在那里四边全栽上垂柳，两边建筑两个花园，花园旁边建个亭子，买几付象棋、扑克，再打两只小船，给青年人休息天来玩玩。这里又适中又有纪念意义。”他说着突然转过脸，对几个小伙子说：“你们站在这里做什么，快去挖塘。”几个小伙子“嘻嘻”一笑蹓走了。但是一转眼，我们的身旁又站了更多的年青人，他们像在听一个神话的故事那样入神，一个个又红又黑的面孔上，堆满了幸福的微笑。其中有一个听了花园、小船的，乐得不知怎样是好，不断用膀子触着旁边的人，那个劲头像在说：“你听，你听，我们的国家，我们的合作社，把我们青年人的生活，安排得多么美妙啊！”
    小雨还在落着，但是，围在地图四周的人，没有一个发现衣服上的雨点。
    “这里是社务委员的办公室和俱乐部，我看就从这里向东向西开一条大街，南北再开一条大街，成十字形。”有人提议道。
    “这样开辟，好处不少，靠近高压线的变压站，用电又方便。”另一个人又附议说。建设委员看大家都没意见，就忙用红水钢笔，在地图上划了个十字形的双道红线。
    是的，这有什么可争论的呢？这座十字大街的第一幢房子——社务委员会的办公室和俱乐部已经落成。在俱乐部的东边，有两间新屋，那是供销合作社的门市部，里边陈列着社员们生活中所必须的食盐、油、腌鱼、糖果，穿的布匹，毛线，绒衫和日用百货，以及一部分生产资料。在门市部的隔壁，是一大间会计室，里边正坐着3位会计，埋头敲着算盘。走出会计室，就是五间宽大的俱乐部，里边摆着20多张桌子，和数十条长凳。这就是全社150多个青年临时上课的课堂。东西两边都有一块簇新的黑板。墙壁上挂着12面奖旗——这是全社的光荣：有安徽省人民政府奖赠的，有六安专员公署奖赠的。最近，又加了一面红缎的新奖旗，上面题有“不怕困难，克服困难”八个大字。这是团城南区委会奖给有150名青年的突击队的。因为，他们在40天冬修中，已经挖了1，000多方土。在俱乐部的西隔壁，就是社的门诊部，一位青年医士和女接生员，正在忙碌着，把许多药品分门别类地陈列到橱子里去。
    这时候，你再回过头来一看，门前正是六（安）霍（山）公路，载货卡车像穿梭似的来往奔驰，把一根根钢筋、水泥做成的高压电线杆，送到公路的两旁。在那个叫“大金盖”的高墩上，已经着手盖一个输电的变压站。这就是刚才那个附议者说，十字大街用电方便的道理。
    在地图的最上角，又有个小红圈圈，我问一位同志，那是什么意思。他说：“这是早已规划了的一个小型的砖瓦厂。它将在1957年建成，烧出的砖瓦专供社员在这个场上——他的手指又移到双道红线的十字街上——盖住宅，接着他的手指在图上这里一点，那里一划——在这里盖拖拉机站，这里盖抽水机站，这里盖第一耕作区管理处，这里盖第二耕作区管理处……。”住社干部张伯敏，用红水笔，从十字大街起，就紧追着这位介绍第一耕作区，第二耕作区的同志划出的红线，又一弯一弯的划了一道很粗的红线，说：“这是一条‘前进路’，它通过第一耕作区，绕过这里，再到第三耕作区。这是一条‘幸福路’……这是一条‘民主路’……。”
    “养羊场和蚕场，我看就放到这个岗上，又高又宽。”张世英大声嚷着。但是大家还没有听清。因为，在广场的那一边，150多青年突击队员，震耳的歌声传来了：
    “从城市到农村，从农村到城市，
    合作社是桥梁，……。”
    或许是指挥者把音定得太高了吧，刚这样唱了几句，大家的喉咙无法再提高了，于是一阵阵震耳的哄然大笑。以致办公室里“当当”的电话铃声响了好半天，人们才去接它。
    “我看养羊场和蚕场，应该放到这个大鱼塘的旁边，因为蚕尿、羊粪可以喂鱼，而且，在这里一道长埂上，又是栽桑树的场子，这对养鱼、喂蚕都方便。”陈良涛指着十字大街南边的一个小岗，对胡传金说。
    “我们安7个扩大器的柱子全有了，究竟埋在那几个场子，你们研究好没有？”一个青年跑来说道。
    “总之，一广播要全社都能听到就行。”陈良涛说着，仍然把头低到图上，叽咕道：“牛场放在那里？”
    “这里最适宜。”胡传金说着把指头指到一个标明山岗的点子上。
    “老周，你怎么不发表发表意见，这是我们的社会主义建设呀！”老马突然掉过头来，拉拉我的袖子说。
    是的，自从这张新的地图摆到桌上，我一直没有说一句话。每当地图上圈了一片果园的标志，划出十字大街的双红线，新式猪、牛、羊、蚕场的记号，林立的电线杆、电话杆，以及砖瓦厂、风景区的记号，我的心是多么的激动啊！前3个月，全乡11个初级社，虽然建社已三、四年了，在生产上有了不小发展，但是，在这张地图上所标志的一切，连影子还没有呢。现在，经过短短的几个月时间，他们11个初级社，合并成一个高级社，人力物力就更加集中，对发展多种经济的生产，开辟了更广阔的道路。社会主义的农村，像苏联农村那样的美好图景，一定要出现！它不是在很远的地方，就在我们的眼前。
