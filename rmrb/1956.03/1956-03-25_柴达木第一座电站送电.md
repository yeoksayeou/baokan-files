    The first power station built in the Qaidam Basin recently began sending electricity. Currently, this power station is fully supplying all the power and lighting needs of the various auxiliary factories at the drilling base, and soon it will also send electricity to deep exploration well sites more than ten kilometers away.

    During the construction of the plant, workers of all ethnic groups overcame various difficulties encountered in construction in the high-altitude cold region. A certain generator, which was originally planned to take four days to install, was installed in only two days. Lineman Tian Shoucheng improved the wiring technology, and his work efficiency increased by two times compared to the beginning.

    柴达木第一座电站送电
    柴达木盆地新建成的第一座发电站最近开始送电。现在，这个电站正在充分供应钻井基地各辅助工厂的全部动力和照明用电，不久还要把电送到十公里以外的深探井井场上去。
    在建厂期间，各族职工克服在高寒地区施工的各种困难。原计划四天才能安装好的某号发电机，只用两天时间就安装好了。线路工人田守成改进架线技术，工作效率比开始提高了两倍。
