A Suite Praising Labor and Struggle
——Reading the "Selected Short Stories" Compiled by the Chinese Writers Association——
Lan Ling

The public often criticizes literary and artistic creation for lagging behind the development of reality. This criticism serves to remind and urge writers. However, to effectively solve this problem, we must start from the actual practice of current literary and artistic creation and not ignore the good works that have emerged in the past two years. Recently, the five anthologies edited by the Chinese Writers Association have collected relatively excellent works that have appeared in the past two years. This can help us understand the actual situation of literary and artistic creation in a realistic way.

The "Selected Short Stories" is one of these anthologies, including 37 works. Its authors include well-known veteran writers, as well as young new writers who have emerged from workers, farmers, soldiers, students, and ethnic minorities.

The prominent feature of this anthology is that the writers enthusiastically praise the new life, sing the praises of the victories won by advanced figures in labor and struggle, and reflect the most important changes in real life.

The works reflecting rural life occupy the most space, reflecting the tremendous changes caused by the agricultural cooperation movement from several important aspects of rural life. Li Zhun's "Cannot Take That Road," which is already familiar to everyone, is one of the earliest works in literary and artistic creation to reflect the new contradictions and struggles arising in rural life, pointing out the trend of differentiation among peasants after the land reform, pointing out the danger of spontaneous capitalist tendencies, which can lead to the impoverishment and bankruptcy of some people, while others degenerate, preventing peasants from finally achieving liberation, and only the Party can guide them to embark on the road of light and happiness together. Li Gubei's "Rural Oddities" satirizes, with a relatively humorous tone, the backward peasant Deng Shan, who is painfully rolling in the circle of selfish ideas formed by the long-term small-scale individual economy. Deng Shan not only does not believe in the government's genuine concern for the peasants, but also tries to take the opportunity to deceive the government and take advantage of the public, resulting in a ridiculous end. Of course, the most important are those works that express the extraordinary deeds of new people fighting for a new life and the happy lives full of joy. In these works, portraits of new people are drawn, they love labor and new life, are active and enthusiastic, enterprising, and dare to wage uncompromising struggles against backward and conservative forces. They are the builders of a new life, and the lofty ideal of building socialism blossoms like beautiful flowers in everyone's hearts. Jun Qing's "Old Water Buffalo Grandpa" writes about the admirable and praiseworthy life of a person. Old Water Buffalo Grandpa was a hero who was wholeheartedly born and died for the masses in the years of war. When building a new life, he dedicated his life to protecting the lives and property of the vast masses in his hometown. Although Old Water Buffalo Grandpa drowned in the Wei River in order to block the breach in the embankment, his deeds became legends and will always live in the hearts of the people on both sides of the Wei River. In Xi Rong's "Old Song Enters the City," Old Song has a sense of pride because he personally experienced the superiority of agricultural cooperatives in all aspects, and he combines everything of his own with the cooperative. The things that the individual economy had added to the peasants were shaken off like dust on their bodies, and the keynote running through his entire life was an irrepressible joy. Due to the changes in political and economic life in the countryside, the relationship between people, family relations, especially the status of women, has changed, and customs have also changed. Kang Zhuo's "Spring Planting and Autumn Harvest," Liu Zhen's "Sister Chun," and Gao Xiaosheng's "Contract Termination" all vividly show the free love generated by young men and women in the countryside in common political life and labor, showing the purity of their thoughts and feelings and the sublimity of their moral character.

There are relatively few works depicting workers in this anthology, which should be said to be a weakness. This is because most writers are not very familiar with the labor and life of workers, and literary creation lacks a good tradition in this regard like the creation reflecting rural life. However, from the anthology, we can see a gratifying phenomenon. Some veteran writers have begun to work hard to understand the workers and describe them. At the same time, talented young writers have also emerged from among the workers, and Fei Liwen is one of them. His work "One Year" is a passionate ode to labor. It reflects the rapid progress of industrial construction and the soaring labor enthusiasm of workers, the tenacious perseverance in the pursuit of new things, and everyone is chasing time to move forward. The image of the female worker Ye Ying in Nan Ding's "Inspector Ye Ying" is very moving. Like the emerging forces on various fronts, she loves her work and dares to boldly and resolutely fight against backward and conservative forces, and her high sense of responsibility for her work is precisely embodied in her serious and solemn work attitude and her struggle against backward and conservative forces. Gao Yanchang's "My Friend" shows the workers' simple, humble style, sincere friendship, and comradely love. Wei Wei's "Old Chimney" describes how an old worker with relatively backward ideas gets rid of selfish ideas after a painful struggle. The emergence of these works is worthy of attention.

Writers also enthusiastically praised the people's soldiers, who overcame all kinds of difficulties and hardships in order to build the motherland more prosperous and the people's lives happier. If Liu Baiyu's "The Road Raising Dust" movingly describes how the volunteer soldiers used their high intelligence, wit, and bravery to defeat the enemy and successfully complete their tasks, then his "Letter from Afar" further reveals the source of this spiritual strength of the soldiers. The soldiers commonly love a photo of a baby, and they don't even know which country it was sent from. However, they are all willing to bravely fight the enemy for it, and what they want to defend is precisely the future of mankind. The soldiers have a heart as strong as steel for the enemy, but they have a heart as loving as a mother for the baby who represents the future of mankind. This is their noble soul and the real reason why they are respected. He Guyan's "Maple" describes the noble friendship formed by the volunteer soldiers in bloody battles, which is "like a red flame," illuminating the road of battle. The scouts described in Wang Gongpu's "The Green Bottom Layer" are like sensitive tentacles, fighting against the lurking enemy with a hundredfold vigilance in extremely difficult environments, guarding the border of the motherland.

Living in the free and happy new era, people still miss the history of past struggles and the sacrificed heroes. In terms of historical themes, Jun Qing's "Dawn on the Riverbank" is a work with strong artistic appeal. It tells the reader about the heroic deeds of the people in the struggle against the enemy, and it is a war song full of storm-like majestic power. The heroic image of the Xiao Chen family in the work is as solemn and lofty as the mountains standing on both sides of the Wei River. The author combines his love for the people and his exquisite observation of the nature of his hometown, creatively portraying vivid artistic images. In addition, Wang Yuanjian's "Party Membership Dues" and Han Zi's "Mom's Story" praise the female heroes who bravely sacrificed in the struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries. For the bright future of the vast people and for upholding their loyalty to the revolutionary cause, they dedicated their precious lives. The heroes in these works make people always miss them with tears of excitement and respect, drawing spiritual strength from them.

However, from this anthology, we can also see the shortcomings and weaknesses in the creation of short stories. Short stories can reflect the changes in life more quickly and can more conveniently express the most moving episodes in any corner of the rich real life. However, the overall living area reflected in this anthology is not wide enough, and in the works describing the same living theme, there are often excessive repetitions of characters and plots. In terms of artistic techniques, some works still appear monotonous, rigid, and boring. As a form of short story, it is not concise and concentrated enough. Some works often limit the performance of characters to a relatively narrow range, lacking a high degree of artistic generalization; some writers still lack their own unique artistic style, and even give people a sense of similarity. This is by no means simply a technical issue, nor is it a question of who imitates whom, but fundamentally, the observation and understanding of life is not deep and meticulous enough. Many things that are superficially the same or similar are seen, but the unique things hidden behind are not seen or not fully seen, which not only limits the depth of the work's reflection of reality, but also affects the diversity of the work's artistic style. Moving forward on the basis of existing achievements is the expectation of the vast number of readers for the writers who create short stories.

    歌颂劳动和斗争的组曲
    ——读中国作家协会编的“短篇小说选”——
    蓝翎
    舆论界经常责备文艺创作落后于现实的发展，这种责备起了提醒和督促作家的作用。但是，要有效地解决这一问题就必须从目前文艺创作实践的实际出发，不能够忽视近两年多来已经出现的好作品。最近，中国作家协会编辑的五本选集，收集了近两年多来所出现的比较优秀的作品。这可以帮助我们实事求是地去了解文艺创作的实际状况。
    “短篇小说选”是这几个选集中的一个，包括37篇作品。它的作者有大家已经熟悉的老作家，也有从工人、农民、战士、学生和兄弟民族中出现的年轻的新作家。
    这个选集突出的特点是作家们以饱满的热情歌颂着新的生活，歌颂先进的人物在劳动、斗争中所获得的胜利，对于现实生活里最重要的变化都有所反映。
    其中占篇幅最多的是反映农村生活的作品，从农村生活的几个重要方面反映了由于农业合作化运动所引起的巨大变化。已经为大家所熟知的李准的“不能走那条路”，就是在文艺创作中最早的一篇反映了农村生活中所产生的新的矛盾和斗争的作品，指出了土地改革以后农民中间分化的趋势，指出了资本主义自发倾向的危险性，它可以导致一部分人贫困破产，而另一部分人蜕化变质，使农民不能最后得到解放，而只有党才能引导他们共同走上光明幸福的大道。李古北的“农村奇事”以比较富有风趣的幽默笔调，讽刺了在小农个体经济长期所形成的自私观念的圈子里痛苦地翻滚着的落后农民登山。登山不仅不相信人民政府对农民的真正关怀，反而想趁机欺骗政府，沾公家的便宜，结果落了个啼笑皆非的下场。当然，最主要的还是那些表现为新生活而斗争的新人物的不平凡的事迹和充满愉快欢乐的幸福生活的作品。在这些作品里，画出了新人物的群像，他们热爱劳动和新的生活、积极热情、富有进取心、勇于和落后和保守势力作不妥协的斗争。他们是新生活的建设者，建设社会主义的崇高理想像美丽的花朵一样开在每个人的心灵中。峻青的“老水牛爷爷”写了一个人可泣可歌的光辉的一生。老水牛爷爷在战争的年代里是一心一意为群众而出生入死的英雄，在建设新生活的时候，他又为了保护家乡广大群众的生命和财产而献出了自己的生命。老水牛爷爷虽然为了堵住堤上的漏洞而淹死在潍河里，但是他的事迹变成了传说，永远活在潍河两岸人民的心里。西戎的“宋老大进城”里的宋老大由于亲身体会到农业合作社在各个方面的优越性，因而产生了一种自豪感，他把自己的一切都和合作社结合起来。个体经济所曾加给农民的东西像身上的尘土一样被抖掉了，而贯串在他整个生活中的基调是一种无法抑制的欢乐情绪。由于农村里政治生活经济生活的变化，人和人之间的关系、家庭关系、特别是妇女的地位改变了，风俗习惯也改变了。康濯的“春种秋收”、刘真的“春大姐”、高晓声的“解约”都生动地表现出了农村男女青年在共同的政治生活和劳动中产生的自由的爱情，表现了他们思想情感的纯洁和道德品质的崇高。
    表现工人的作品在这个选集里比较少，应该说是一个弱点，这是由于大部分作家还不太熟悉工人的劳动和生活，而文学创作在这方面又缺乏像反映农村生活的创作那样良好的传统。但是，从选集里，可以看到令人欢喜的现象。有的老作家已经开始努力地去了解工人，并描写他们。同时，从工人中间也出现了有才能的年轻的作家，费礼文就是其中的一个。他的作品“一年”是对劳动的热情颂歌。它反映了工业建设的突飞猛进和工人高涨的劳动热情、追求新事物的坚韧的毅力，人人都追赶着时间前进。南丁的“检验工叶英”里女工叶英的形象是很动人的。她像在各个战线上出现的新生力量一样，热爱自己的工作，敢于大胆地坚决地和落后保守势力作斗争，而她对工作的高度责任感正是体现在认真严肃的工作态度和对落后保守势力的斗争里。高延昌的“我的朋友”表现了工人的朴素、谦逊的作风、真诚的友谊和同志的爱。魏巍的“老烟筒”描写了一个思想比较落后的老工人如何经过痛苦的斗争而摆脱了自私的观念。这些作品的出现是值得重视的。
    作家们也用极大的热情歌颂了人民的战士，他们战胜了各种各样的艰难困苦，为了祖国建设得更富强，人民生活得更幸福。如果说刘白羽的“扬着灰尘的路上”是动人地写出了志愿军战士如何用高度的聪慧、机智、勇敢战胜了敌人，胜利地完成了任务，那么，他的“远方来信”就进一步揭示出了战士们这种精神力量的源泉。战士们共同地热爱一张婴儿的照片，甚至并不知道它是从那一个国家寄来的，然而他们都愿意为它而奋勇地和敌人战斗，他们所要保卫的就正是这人类的未来。战士们对于敌人有一颗像钢一样刚强的心，对于代表人类的未来的婴儿却有一颗像母亲一样慈爱的心，这就是他们崇高的灵魂，也是令人尊敬的真正原因。和谷岩的“枫”描写了志愿军战士在血的战斗中所结成的崇高的友谊，它正“像一团红色的火焰”一样，照耀着战斗的道路。王公浦的“绿色的底层”里所描写的侦察员们，像灵敏的触角一样，在极端艰苦的环境里，以百倍的警惕和潜伏的敌人作斗争，保卫着祖国的边疆。
    生活在自由幸福的新时代里，人们仍然怀念着过去斗争的历史，怀念着牺牲了的英雄们。在表现历史的题材方面，峻青的“黎明的河边”是具有强烈的艺术感染力的作品，它告诉了读者人民在同敌人的斗争中所表现出的英雄事迹，是充满着暴风雨般的宏伟力量的战歌。作品里小陈一家人的英雄形象，就像潍河两岸矗立着的群山那样的庄严崇高。作者把他对人民的爱和对家乡大自然的精致的观察结合在一起，具有独创性地刻画出了生动的艺术形象。此外，王愿坚的“党费”和菡子的“妈妈的故事”是歌颂了在同国民党反动派的斗争中而英勇牺牲了的妇女英雄，为了广大人民美好的未来、为了坚持对革命事业的忠诚，她们献出了自己宝贵的生命。这些作品里的英雄，使人永远怀着激动的眼泪和尊敬的情感想念着他们，从他们那里汲取精神力量。
    但是，从这个选集中，也还可以看出短篇小说的创作中不够的地方和弱点。短篇小说是可以比较迅速地反映生活的变化，能够比较方便地表现丰富的现实生活的任何一个角落里最动人的插曲。可是这个选集所反映的总的生活面还不够广泛，在描写同一个生活题材的作品里，常常有人物、情节过多的重复。在艺术技巧方面，有些作品还显得单调、呆板、枯燥。作为短篇小说的形式，还不够精练、集中，有的作品往往把人物的表现限制在比较狭小的范围里，缺少高度的艺术概括；有些作家还缺乏自己独特的艺术风格，甚至给人以雷同的感觉。这绝不单纯是一个技巧问题，也不是谁模仿谁的问题，而根本的是对生活的观察理解还不够深刻细致，看到了很多表面相同或相似的东西，而看不到或者没有全部看到背后所潜藏着的独特的东西，这不但限制了作品反映现实的深度，而且影响了作品的艺术风格的多样性。在已有的成绩的基础上更前进一步，这是广大的读者对创作短篇小说的作家们的期望。
