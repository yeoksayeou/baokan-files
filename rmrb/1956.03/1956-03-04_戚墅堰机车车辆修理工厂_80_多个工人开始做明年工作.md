Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd. The Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory overfulfilled the state plan for January and February this year. By the end of February, seven advanced workers, including Zhuang Minggeng and Zhuang Jinkui, had completed the workload for the first Five-Year Plan. More than 80 workers in the mechanical and forging workshops have also begun working on the workload for 1957.

Since January, workshops, work areas, teams, and individuals in this factory have formulated plans to carry out socialist competitions. When the Gu Jiagen Advanced Youth Team in the forging workshop manufactured diesel engine connecting rods, they improved the die forging tools and operating methods, increasing forging efficiency from 7 rods to 25 rods per day, completing more than 4 months of work in January and February. In the first three years of the first Five-Year Plan, this advanced youth team had already completed 3 years and 9 months of work. Feng Zhaoliang of the wheel workshop learned Zhuang Minggeng's advanced operating methods and improved the turning tool for tire hoops, completing 12 and a half hours of quota in 7 hours. Many workers who were unable to complete the quota in the past have now generally reached or exceeded the quota. More than 95% of the factory's workers have reached or exceeded their work quotas.

    新华社南京2日电　戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂超额完成了今年1月和2月份的国家计划。到2月底为止，庄铭耕、庄金奎等7个先进工作者都已经完成了第一个五年计划的工作量。机械、锻冶两车间的80多个工人也在开始做1957年的工作量。
    这个厂的各车间、工区、小组和个人，1月份以来都制定了开展社会主义竞赛的计划。锻冶车间顾家根先进青年小组制造柴油机连杆的时候，改进了胎型锻造工具和操作方法，锻造效率每天由7根提高到25根，在1月和2月份内共完成了4个多月的工作量。这个先进青年小组在第一个五年计划的头三年中，已经完成3年零9个多月的工作量了。车轮车间冯兆良学习庄铭耕的先进操作方法，改进搪轮箍的车刀，7小时完成了12小时半的定额。许多工人过去完不成定额，现在普遍达到或突破了定额。全厂工人中，有95％以上已经达到或突破了工时定额。
