    Watching the Play "The Eve"
  　Zhao Xun
    Playwright: Yang Runzhen; Director: He Chi, Liu Wenqing; Performed by Tianjin People's Art Theatre
    The play "The Eve," reflecting the struggle between two roads in the countryside, breaks away from the old clichés of scripts on this kind of subject matter in its creative method. It abandons the practice of translating policy concepts into images and pays more attention to portraying life and depicting characters.
    The dramatic conflict begins like this: The land of the two poor peasant households, Tian Fuqiu and Gao Heichou, are connected. The roots of the pear tree in Heichou's yard extend into Fuqiu's land. Fuqiu complains that Heichou's tree roots are sapping his "earth energy," and Heichou complains that Fuqiu's hoeing is damaging his tree roots; hence, they argue incessantly. These kinds of things were common in the countryside in the past. It illustrates the backwardness of the small-peasant economy and the private ownership system, and the suffering and misfortune of the peasants under this yoke.
    From this conflict, it leads to a further revelation of the class struggle in the countryside. The contradiction between Tian Fuqiu and Gao Heichou becomes complicated and deepened because of Hu Maoru's participation. Village Chief Hu Maoru relied on exploitation to climb to the position of a rich peasant. He plans to get the good land of the Tian and Gao families into his own hands, using Yin Jianjian, who used to be a landlord's lackey, to provoke the relationship between Tian and Gao, in order to find a way to buy their land. In this way, the contradiction between Tian and Gao and the conflict between poor and rich peasants are combined.
    The script makes a vivid depiction of the class struggle in the countryside. Although Hu Maoru also wants to annex the land of the Tian and Gao families, he adopts different means. For Tian Fuqiu, he wants to use high-interest loans to forcibly take over the land; for Gao Heichou, he wants to use feudal family relationships to bring both the person and the land into his family through marrying a daughter-in-law. Thus, whether Hu Maoru can marry a wife for his son (Gao Heichou's only daughter, Shuying), or whether the love between Tian Fuqiu's son (Chunshan) and Gao Heichou's daughter is victorious, becomes the center of the struggle again. Because whether Chunshan and Shuying can marry depends on whether Fuqiu and Heichou can reconcile, and whether Fuqiu and Heichou can reconcile is a sign of who will win between Hu Maoru's capitalist line and the cooperative's socialist line. In this way, what seems to be a family dispute, a love story of a young couple, contains the social content of class struggle.
    In the second act, the author gives a wonderful comedic depiction of this conflict. Gao Shuying knows that the honest and somewhat foolish Hu Guagua is coming to talk about love because someone is directing him from behind. She can't help but make some jokes with him. Of course, she doesn't want to make fun of the pitiful Hu Guagua, but to satirize Hu Maoru, who uses his son as a tool to seize land. Before Hu Guagua leaves, Tian Chunshan arrives. From a fake love affair, it turns into a real love affair. Tian Chunshan brought back the good news of establishing a cooperative from the district, and also brought back the guarantee of their marriage. But things are not as smooth as imagined. Hu Maoru persuaded Gao Heichou to give Gao Shuying a bride price. Thus, Gao Shuying has to clash with her father; here, she is not only fighting for her legitimate right to marital autonomy, but also expressing a righteous resistance to Hu Maoru's despicable behavior. This is a description of love and also a struggle of two ideologies. What is valuable is that these ideological contents are expressed through the depiction of life, dramatic conflict, and the portrayal of characters. Therefore, it can arouse the interest of the audience.
    The struggle shown in the script, if it were in the old society, would likely end in tragedy. But today, the situation is completely different. Under the leadership of the Party, Xingxing Village has cadres and progressive masses like Wang Tiejang and Tian Chunshan. Although Hu Maoru has adopted various hidden methods, he still can't help but run into snags everywhere. Once the cooperative is established, all his dreams are shattered, and his last desperate act of sabotage is exposed in front of the masses. Hu Maoru and his capitalist line completely collapsed in Xingxing Village.
    The author portrays the images of various peasants on the eve of the socialist upsurge in the countryside. Among them, Tian Fuqiu and Gao Heichou are more prominent. Fuqiu's personality is kind and weak. Heichou is irritable and upright. The two poor peasants have different aspects, but also have common aspects: that is, they all believe in the Party and believe in Chairman Mao. When they understand the benefits of the cooperative, they all have hope for the cooperative. New ideas and old ideas coexist in them. Unfortunately, the emotional aspect of the old ideas is portrayed more vividly, while the emotional aspect of the new ideas is relatively thin; therefore, it is not easy to see the clear changes of the era from the characters, as well as the foundation of mass consciousness that already existed on the eve of the cooperativization movement.
    The image of the rich peasant in the script also has its characteristics, unlike the rich peasants in general works who are just simple class symbols that can be seen at a glance. Hu Maoru is a new rich peasant who rose during the process of class differentiation after the land reform. He used to participate in the revolution and was supported by the masses, so he became the village chief. Therefore, he can say a lot of revolutionary principles in words. On the other hand, his economic status determines that he wants to harm others and benefit himself, and climb upwards by stepping on others. He is a rich peasant element who is hypocritical and can play two-faced tricks. Although there are still shortcomings in the artistic portrayal of this character, it should also be said that there has been further excavation of the character of the rich peasant.
    The three young people all have some personality characteristics: Hu Guagua is honest and simple. Although the author uses few strokes, his image is vividly outlined. Because Tian Chunshan has more words than actions, and the author did not show him in the test of struggle, he seems a bit flimsy; but you can also see his enthusiasm, idealism, and enterprising spirit. The most lovely of the three is Gao Shuying, this lively, intelligent, and decisive rural girl, who leaves a deep and moving impression. The reason why this character is portrayed better is because her personality is highlighted from her contact with many aspects of the characters, especially in the layers of struggle. On the contrary, the Party branch secretary, Wang Tiejang, is often in a passive position in the script, and even his role is not seen in the struggle, so the image of this positive character has not been created.
    The major shortcoming of the script is that the conflict of contradictions is not fully developed. Before the end of the third act, under the leadership of the Party (Wang Tiejang), the poor peasants (Tian Chunshan) and the rich peasants (Hu Maoru) have launched a face-to-face struggle, and all the contradictions will converge into this class struggle. The audience is waiting for a more tense and more exciting dramatic conflict below. However, the major conflict of contradictions is resolved behind the scenes. The fourth act is superficially lively, but in reality it has no strength. In this way, the climax that just began suddenly declined, and the conflict was resolved too easily; it not only does not conform to the reality of life and cannot convince people, but also makes the characters that have been shaped not developed, and cannot give people a complete impression. The transformation and reconciliation of Fuqiu and Heichou will only be natural and moving when the contradictions are fully developed. The advanced ideological qualities and rich spiritual world of Wang Tiejang and Tian Chunshan can only be displayed in sharp struggles. Otherwise, people with old ideas have not shown a credible transformation, and people with new ideas have no chance to show positive strength.
    The performance did not make up for the shortcomings of the script, and the personalities of some characters were expressed in a more one-sided way. For example, although Tian Fuqiu's personality is weak, he is not a "good-for-nothing," and his mental burden should not be overemphasized. Although Gao Heichou's personality is upright, he is not unreasonable; his love for quarreling should not be overemphasized either. Hu Maoru is cunning, but he also has his inner activities, because he is not ignorant of the Party's policies and the development of rural society. The one-sidedness of character personalities will make the dramatic conflict monotonous. There are quarrels in every act of the script, but quarrels are not necessarily real conflicts, and it is even more difficult to show the multiple aspects of the characters' personalities from quarrels alone.
    We can see that although the script has shortcomings, the author is still familiar with rural life. I believe that the author can depict this picture of the eve of the socialist upsurge in the countryside more richly and completely.

    看话剧“前夜”
  　赵寻
    作剧　杨润身　导演　何迟、刘文卿　天津人民艺术剧院演出
    反映农村中两条道路斗争的话剧“前夜”，在创作方法上突破了这类题材的剧本的老套子，抛弃了把政策的概念翻译成形象的写法，而比较注意到表现生活，描写人物。
    戏剧的冲突是这样开始的：田福秋和高黑丑这两户贫农的地土相连，黑丑家的梨树根伸到了福秋家的地里，福秋怨黑丑的树根拔了他的“地气”，黑丑怪福秋锄地伤了他的树根；因而争执不休。这类事情在过去农村中是常有的。它说明了小农经济私有制度的落后，和在这种桎梏下的农民的痛苦和不幸。
    从这个冲突引到对农村阶级斗争的进一步的揭发。田福秋和高黑丑之间的矛盾因为胡茂如的参加而复杂和深化起来。村长胡茂如依靠剥削爬到了富农地位。他盘算着把田、高两家的好地弄到自己手里，利用曾经是地主狗腿子的印尖尖挑拨田、高之间的关系，以便设法把他们的土地收买过来。这样，田、高之间的矛盾和贫农、富农之间的冲突就结合起来了。
    剧本对农村中的阶级斗争作了富有生活气息的描写。胡茂如虽然同样想吞并田、高两家的土地，但却采取了不同的手段。对田福秋他想用高利贷的方法把地硬算了过去；对高黑丑则是通过封建家族的关系，想用娶媳妇的办法把人和土地一块儿带到他家里去。于是胡茂如能为自己的儿子娶上媳妇（高黑丑的独生女树英），还是田福秋的儿子（春山）和高黑丑的女儿恋爱得到胜利又成了斗争的中心。因为春山同树英能不能结婚要看福秋同黑丑能不能和好，而福秋同黑丑能不能和好又是胡茂如的资本主义路线同合作社的社会主义路线谁战胜谁的标志，就这样，看来是一个家庭纠纷，是一对青年男女的恋爱故事，却包含着阶级斗争的社会内容。
    作者在第二幕里对这一冲突作了精彩的喜剧性的描绘。高树英知道忠厚老实而带些傻气的胡瓜瓜来谈恋爱是有人在背后指使的，她忍不住对他开些玩笑，自然她并不是要耍笑可怜的胡瓜瓜，而是要狠狠地嘲讽一下用儿子作工具来夺取土地的胡茂如。胡瓜瓜还没走，田春山就来了。从一场假恋爱，转入一场真恋爱。田春山从区上带回了建立合作社的喜讯，也带回了他俩结婚的保证。可是事情并不是想像的那么顺利，胡茂如说动了高黑丑，要给高树英过财礼，于是，高树英不能不和父亲发生冲突；在这里，她不仅是为自己婚姻自主的合法权利而斗争，更是对胡茂如的卑鄙行为表示正义的反抗。这是恋爱的描写也是两种思想的斗争。可贵的在于：这些思想内容是通过生活的描写，戏剧的冲突，人物性格的刻划，表现出来的。因而能够引起观众的兴趣。
    剧本中所展示的这场斗争，假如在旧社会，那就很可能以悲剧来结束。可是在今天，情况完全不同了。星星寨在党的领导下，有王铁匠和田春山这些干部和进步的群众，胡茂如虽然采取了各种隐蔽的方法，还是不能不到处碰钉子。合作社一建立，他的一切梦想都破碎了，最后一次冒险的破坏也在群众面前被揭露了。胡茂如和他的资本主义路线在星星寨彻底地垮台了。
    作者描绘了在农村社会主义高潮前夜多种农民的形象。其中田福秋、高黑丑这两个人物是比较突出的。福秋的个性是善良而软弱。黑丑则暴躁刚直。两个贫农有不同的地方，却也有共同的地方：那就是他们都相信党，相信毛主席。当他们理解了合作社的好处以后，都对合作社抱着希望。新的思想和旧的思想一起在他们身上存在着。可惜的是旧思想情感的一面刻划得比较形象，新思想情感的一面则比较单薄；因而不容易从人物身上看到时代鲜明的变化，以及在合作化运动前夜已经具有的群众觉悟的基础。
    剧本中的富农形象也是具有特点的，不像一般作品中的富农那样只是一个一眼就能看清的简单的阶级符号。胡茂如是在土地改革以后阶级分化过程中上升起来的新富农，他过去参加过革命，并为群众所拥护，因而当了村长。所以他口头上会说不少革命道理。另一方面，他的经济地位决定了他要损人利己，踩在别人头上往上爬。这是口是心非、会耍两面派手段的富农分子。虽然在艺术上这个人物的刻划还存在着缺点，但也应该说对于富农的性格有了进一步的挖掘。
    三个年轻人都有一些性格特征：胡瓜瓜忠厚憨直，作者虽然用笔不多，他的形象却被勾划得很生动。田春山因为言论多于行动，作者没有在斗争的考验中来表现他，所以显得有些轻飘；但是也能看到他热情、富有理想和进取精神的一面。三个人中最可爱的是高树英，这个活泼、聪明、果敢的农村姑娘，给人留下了深刻动人的印象。这个人物之所以刻划得较好，是因为从她对多方面人物的接触中，特别是在一重重的斗争中突现了她的性格。相反的倒是党支部书记王铁匠在剧本中常常是处在被动的地位，甚至在斗争中看不到他的作用，因而这个正面人物的形象没有创造出来。
    剧本的重大缺点是矛盾冲突没有充分展开。在第三幕结束之前，在党（王铁匠）的领导下，贫农（田春山）和富农（胡茂如）已经展开了面对面的斗争，一切矛盾冲突都将汇流到这一阶级斗争中去，观众正等待着下面更紧张、更动人心魄的戏剧冲突。可是，重大的矛盾冲突却在幕后解决了。第四幕表面上很热闹，实际却没有力量。这样，刚开始掀起的高潮就突然低落了下去，冲突解决得过于容易；不但不符合生活的真实，不能使人信服，也使已经塑造出来的人物性格得不到发展，不能给人以完整的印象。福秋、黑丑的转变同和好只有在矛盾充分展开的时候才会自然和动人。王铁匠、田春山的先进思想品质和丰富的精神世界，也只有在尖锐的斗争中才能显示。不然，具有旧思想的人没有表现出令人可信的转变，具有新思想的人也没有机会表现出积极的力量。
    演出并没有弥补剧本的缺点，有些人物的个性就表现得比较片面。例如田福秋虽然性格软弱，但并不是“窝囊废”，不应该过份强调他的精神负担。高黑丑虽然性格刚直，但并不是蛮不讲理；也不应该太强调他爱吵闹的一面。胡茂如是狡猾的，但也有他的内心活动，因为他并不是对党的政策和农村社会的发展一无所知的。人物性格的片面化会使戏剧的冲突单调的。剧本中每一幕都有争吵，然而争吵并不一定是真实的冲突，更不容易光从争吵中展示人物多方面的性格。
    我们可以看出，剧本虽然有缺点，作者还是熟悉农村生活的，相信作者是能够把这一幅农村社会主义高潮前夜的图画描绘得更加丰富、更加完整的。
