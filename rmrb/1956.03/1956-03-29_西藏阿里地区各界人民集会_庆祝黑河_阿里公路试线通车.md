In just over 20 days, they arrived on the 23rd at Gada Gram, a major town in the westernmost part of Tibet.

On the 24th, over 400 people from all walks of life in the Ali area of Tibet held a rally in Gada Gram to celebrate the trial opening of the Hei (Heihe) - A (Ali) Highway. Niu Qingshan, the leader of the Hei-A Highway survey team and representatives from the CPC Tibet Working Committee and the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army who attended the celebration rally spoke first. He said: The trial opening of the Hei-A Highway provides a reliable route for this highway.

    西藏阿里地区各界人民集会
    庆祝黑河—阿里公路试线通车
    据新华社噶大克电　西藏全长约一千三百多公里的黑（河）阿（里）公路已经试线通车了。一个踏勘队的汽车队从上月二十四日由黑河出发，边勘边修，只经过二十多天，就在二十三日到达了西藏最西部的重镇——噶大克。
    二十四日，西藏阿里地区各界人民四百多人，在噶大克举行庆祝黑（河）阿（里）公路试线通车大会。中共西藏工委和中国人民解放军西藏军区参加庆祝大会的代表、黑阿公路踏勘队长牛青山首先讲话，他说：黑阿公路试线通车，为这条公路提供了一条可靠的路线。这条路线在正式修筑前稍加修整，春、秋、冬三季就基本上可以通行汽车。从前，拉萨阿里间两年往返一次的路程，现在一个多月就可往返一次了。他向阿里各界人民、驻阿里的部队和工作人员表示热烈的祝贺和慰问。西藏地方政府驻阿里噶本罗桑才旺等也在会上讲了话。
