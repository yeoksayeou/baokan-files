    First Successful Design for 154 kV Power Transmission Line Using Reinforced Concrete Poles
    Design personnel at the Changchun Electric Power Design Branch of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry have successfully designed, for the first time, a 154 kV power transmission line project that uses reinforced concrete poles instead of iron towers. Calculations based solely on a 200-kilometer transmission line to be erected in Northeast China this year show that nearly 2,000 tons of steel can be saved for the country.
    Currently, among existing power transmission lines in the country, the highest voltage using reinforced concrete poles is 110 kV. Because 154 kV wires are thicker and have greater tensile force, iron towers have been used in the past. To save steel for the country, the design personnel at the Changchun Electric Power Design Branch, based on their design experience with 110 kV reinforced concrete poles, began designing a 154 kV power transmission line project using reinforced concrete poles instead of iron towers in September of last year. Many complex technical problems encountered during the design process were solved under the guidance of Soviet experts, making the design more economical and safer. The designers also designed the reinforced concrete poles, which are more than 20 meters high, in several sections for easy transportation and erection.
    This transmission line will still use a small portion of non-linear iron towers that can withstand large tensile forces. Currently, the designers have already begun designing to replace these iron towers with reinforced concrete poles as well. This year, there are also plans to pilot the design of a 220 kV power transmission line project using reinforced concrete poles instead of iron towers.

    首次设计成功用钢筋混凝土杆架设154千伏送电线
    电力工业部长春电力设计分院的设计人员，第一次设计了一条用钢筋混凝土杆代替铁塔架设154千伏送电线工程。仅就今年在东北地区架设的一条长200公里的送电线路计算，就可为国家节省近2，000吨钢材。
    目前在国内现有的送电线路中，用钢筋混凝土杆架设电线最大的电压是110千伏。由于154千伏电线粗，拉力大，过去都用铁塔架设。长春电力设计分院的设计人员为给国家节约钢材，在110千伏钢筋混凝土杆设计经验的基础上，从去年9月开始设计用钢筋混凝土杆代替铁塔架设154千伏送电线工程。设计中遇到的许多复杂的技术问题，在苏联专家指导下都得到了解决，使设计更加经济和安全。设计人员还把20多公尺高的钢筋混凝土杆设计为几段，便于运输和架设。
    这条送电线中仍要采用小部分承受拉力大的非直线铁塔。现在，设计人员已经着手设计使这部分铁塔也改用钢筋混凝土杆。今年还计划试作钢筋混凝土杆代替铁塔架设220伏送电线工程的设计。
