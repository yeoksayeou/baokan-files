    The Middle East not only has important strategic significance, but also extremely rich oil resources. Its reserves account for about 60% of the capitalist world, and its output accounts for about 20% of the capitalist world, and is constantly increasing, reaching 160 million tons in 1955. In the eyes of the colonialists, the Middle East's rich oil is a source of huge profits. For example, in 1954, ARAMCO, the Iraq Petroleum Company, and the Kuwait Oil Company earned a net profit of 709% of their costs from crude oil exploitation in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Kuwait alone. Therefore, for a long time, colonial countries, especially the United States and Britain, have been engaged in an increasingly fierce struggle to compete for the plunder of oil in the Middle East.

    Before World War I, the main contenders for oil in this region were Britain and Germany. After Germany's defeat, the struggle between the United States and Britain for oil in this region intensified.

    Under pressure from the United States, Britain was forced to make some concessions. In 1924, the Turkish Petroleum Company (renamed the Iraq Petroleum Company in 1929), whose shares were 75% owned by British capital and 25% owned by German capital, was reorganized. American oil companies (Standard Oil of New Jersey and Standard Oil of New York), the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Royal Dutch Shell, and the French Petroleum Company each obtained 23.75% of the shares, and British subject Gulbenkian, who had close ties with British monopoly capital, obtained the remaining 5%. From then on, the United States began to intervene in the plunder of oil in the Middle East.

    However, Britain also stepped up its defenses against the expansion of American oil monopoly capital. In 1928, Standard Oil of New Jersey and Standard Oil of New York were forced to conclude a gentlemen's agreement with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, the so-called "Red Line" agreement. It stipulated that American oil companies could not obtain oil exploration rights in the Middle East region outside Mosul without the consent of the British and French oil companies; if they obtained new oil exploration rights with the consent of the British and French oil companies, their share must be distributed according to the proportion of participation in the Iraq Petroleum Company. However, this agreement did not limit the expansion of American oil monopoly capital, but was merely the prelude to a more fierce US-British oil war.

    In 1932, Standard Oil of California and Texaco of the United States seized oil exploration rights on the British-controlled Bahrain Islands. In 1933, these two companies also obtained oil exploration rights in Saudi Arabia. In 1934, Gulf Oil of the United States and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company jointly organized the Kuwait Oil Company on the basis of equal shareholding to plunder oil in Kuwait. In 1938, Standard Oil of New Jersey also obtained oil exploration rights in the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt.

    After World War II, the struggle between the United States and Britain for oil in the Middle East became even more acute.

    American oil monopolists have tried their best to take advantage of Britain's weakness to squeeze out its British "allies." An important measure taken by the United States to attack Britain was the Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement of September 24, 1945 (which came into effect in 1947). According to this agreement, the United States and Britain applied the principles of "equal opportunity" and "equal sharing of interests" in obtaining oil exploration rights. As a result, the "Red Line" agreement of 1928, which was favorable to Britain, was abolished.

    In 1946, Standard Oil of New Jersey and Standard Oil of New York purchased 40% of the shares of ARAMCO without consulting Britain. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company protested to these two companies based on the "Red Line" agreement. In response to Britain's protest, they did not recognize the "Red Line" agreement at all, and believed that this agreement had lost any significance.

    Not only that, these two companies further signed a long-term agreement with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company at the end of 1946. It stipulated that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company must sell 20% (later increased to 40%) of its oil production to Standard Oil of New Jersey and Standard Oil of New York annually at Persian Gulf prices; it also allowed them to build pipelines between Abadan and the Mediterranean to transport this oil. In this way, the United States began to get involved in Iranian oil, which had always been under British control. American oil companies transported this oil to Western European countries, including Britain, and sold it to these countries, thus making a lot of money and exacerbating Britain's "dollar shortage."

    In 1951, when Britain's oil exploration privileges in Iran were abolished, the United States attempted to take the opportunity to seize the oil in southern Iran. For this purpose, it used the most despicable means to create subversive activities in Iran and overthrow the Mossadegh government, which advocated the nationalization of the oil industry.

    In December 1953, representatives of the five major American oil companies and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company began negotiations in London behind the backs of the Iranian people on the sharing of Iranian oil plunder. After a long struggle, Britain was forced to make significant concessions to the United States. As a result, an "International Oil Consortium" was established at the suggestion of the United States to jointly plunder Iranian oil. The five major American oil companies obtained 40% of the shares of this "Consortium", the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (renamed British Petroleum in October 1954) obtained 40%, Royal Dutch Shell obtained 14%, and the French Petroleum Company obtained 6%. After the Iranian government signed an agreement with the "International Oil Consortium" in September 1954, Iran's oil resources once again fell into the hands of foreign colonialists. American oil monopoly capital has gained an important position in the international oil consortium. Now, under the guise of "aid," the United States is trying to squeeze the British out of Iran completely.

    From 1947 to 1949, American oil companies seized oil exploration rights in the "Neutral Zone" between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.

    After the war, due to the intensified intrusion of American monopoly capital into the Middle East oil industry, by the beginning of 1952, American oil investment in this region accounted for 42% of the total investment, surpassing Britain (14%) and becoming the first. At the same time, the proportion of oil production controlled by the United States in the Middle East also increased sharply. Most of this was achieved at the expense of Britain's share. In 1937, the United States' share accounted for only 13.1%, and Britain and Anglo-Dutch companies still controlled about 80% of oil production; but by the beginning of 1952, the United States' share had increased to 58.8%, and Britain's share had decreased to 38.8% due to the loss of Iranian oil; in 1953, the United States' proportion rose again to 59.2%, and Britain's share fell again to 32.8%. Later, the United States also intervened in the plunder of Iranian oil, and the share controlled by the United States became even greater.

    In 1953, the United States controlled 100% of the oil production in Saudi Arabia, the "Neutral Zone," and the Bahrain Islands, 50% of Kuwait's oil production, and 23% of the oil production in Iraq, Qatar, and Egypt.

    In 1954, the "Colorado Oil Company," jointly formed by three American oil companies, seized oil exploration rights for 185,000 square kilometers west of the Nile River in Egypt.

    In the struggle between the United States and Britain for oil in the Middle East, various means were used. They have constantly organized coups, assassinations, and armed provocations in Middle Eastern countries, thereby creating political turmoil in these countries and tension in the Middle East.

    In recent years, new oil fields have been discovered in the Persian Gulf region, which has triggered a new and acute struggle between the US and British oil monopoly capital groups. Fearing that the exploration rights of these new oil fields would fall into the hands of ARAMCO, Britain forcibly occupied the Buraimi Oasis last year, causing a new dispute between the United States and Britain. In the US-British talks held in Washington not long ago, the contradictions and conflicts between the two countries in the Middle East were one of the central issues of the talks. Facts have proved that this conflict of interest between them has not been resolved, nor can it be resolved.

    美英在中近东争夺石油的斗争
    林欣
    中近东不但具有重要的战略意义，而且石油极为丰富，其蕴藏量约占资本主义世界的60％，出产量约占资本主义世界的20％，并且不断增加，1955年达一万六千万吨。在殖民主义者眼里，中近东的丰富的石油是巨额利润的来源。例如，1954年阿美石油公司、伊拉克石油公司和科威特石油公司仅仅在沙特阿拉伯、伊拉克和科威特开采原油而获得的纯利就达到成本的709％。因此，长期以来，殖民国家之间，特别是美英之间，为了竞相掠夺中近东的石油，进行着日益剧烈的斗争。
    第一次世界大战以前，在这个地区争夺石油的主要是英国和德国。德国战败后，美英之间在这个地区争夺石油的斗争就加紧了。
    英国在美国的压力下，被迫作了一些让步。1924年，其股份的75％属英国资本、25％属德国资本的土耳其石油公司（1929年改名为伊拉克石油公司）实行改组。美国的石油公司（新泽西美孚公司和纽约美孚公司）、英伊石油公司、英荷壳牌石油公司和法兰西石油公司各得股票的23.75％，同英国垄断资本有密切联系的英国属民高尔宾江取得其余的5％。从此美国便插足掠夺中近东的石油了。
    但是英国对美国石油垄断资本扩张的防范也加紧了。1928年新泽西美孚公司和纽约美孚公司被迫同英伊石油公司，成立了一项君子协定，即所谓“红线”协定。它规定，美国的石油公司如果不经英法石油公司的同意，不得在摩苏尔以外的中近东地区取得石油的开采权；如果它们在英法石油公司的同意下获得新的采油权，其份额必须按照参加伊拉克石油公司的比例来分配。但是这个协定并没有能限制得了美国石油垄断资本的扩张，而仅仅是更剧烈的美英石油争夺战的序幕。
    1932年美国的加利福尼亚美孚公司和德士古公司夺得了英国控制下的巴林群岛的石油开采权。1933年这两家公司又取得了沙特阿拉伯的石油开采权。1934年美国的海湾石油公司和英伊石油公司在平分股权的基础上，联合组织了科威特石油公司来掠夺科威特的石油。1938年新泽西美孚公司又取得埃及西奈半岛的石油开采权。
    第二次世界大战以后，美英之间在中近东争夺石油的斗争，更加尖锐了。
    美国的石油垄断资本家竭力利用英国的削弱，排挤着它的英国“盟友”。美国打击英国的一个重要措施是1945年9月24日的英美石油协定（1947年生效）。根据这个协定，美国和英国在取得石油开采权方面适用“机会均等”和“利益均沾”的原则。这一来，有利于英国的1928年的“红线”协定，便被废除了。
    1946年新泽西美孚公司和纽约美孚公司，并没有征询英国的意见，向阿（拉伯）美石油公司购买了40％的股票。英伊石油公司根据“红线”协定向这两家公司提出抗议。它们在答复英国的抗议时，根本不承认“红线”协定，并认为这个协定已失去任何意义。
    不仅如此，这两家公司还进一步在1946年底同英伊石油公司签订了长期协定。它规定，英伊石油公司每年必须按照波斯湾价格，把它所出产的石油的20％（以后增至40％）卖给新泽西美孚公司和纽约美孚公司；同时还允许它们在阿巴丹和地中海之间建筑油管来输送这些石油。这样美国又开始染指一直在英国控制下的伊朗石油。美国的石油公司把这些石油运到包括英国在内的西欧国家去，卖给这些国家，因而大赚其钱，并且加剧了英国的“美元荒”。
    1951年当英国在伊朗的开采石油的特权被废除以后，美国就企图乘机夺取伊朗南部的石油。为了这个目的，它使用了最卑鄙的手段，在伊朗制造了颠覆活动，推翻了主张石油工业国有化的摩萨台政府。
    1953年12月，美国五大石油公司和英伊石油公司的代表，背着伊朗人民在伦敦开始关于掠夺伊朗石油的分赃谈判。经过了长期的斗争，英国被迫对美国作了重大的让步。结果根据美国的提议成立了共同掠夺伊朗石油的“国际石油财团”。美国五大石油公司取得这个“财团”股票的40％，英伊石油公司（1954年10月改名为不列颠石油公司）得40％，英荷壳牌石油公司得14％，法兰西石油公司得6％。1954年9月伊朗政府与“国际石油财团”签订了协定以后，伊朗的石油资源又重新落入外国殖民主义者的手中。美国石油垄断资本已在国际石油财团中取得了重要阵地。现在美国正在“援助”的幌子下，设法把英国人完全挤出伊朗。
    1947—1949年，美国的石油公司又夺取了沙特阿拉伯和科威特之间的“中立地”的石油开采权。
    战后，由于美国垄断资本加紧侵入中近东的石油工业，到1952年初美国在这个地区的石油投资已占总投资的42％，超过了英国（占14％）而成为第一位。与此同时，美国在中近东所控制的石油生产量的比重也急剧地增加了。其中大部分是靠牺牲英国的份额而达到的。1937年美国的份额只占13.1％，英国和英荷公司仍控制了80％左右的石油生产；但到1952年初，美国的份额增为58.8％，英国因为失去伊朗的石油只占38.8％；1953年美国的比重又上升为59.2％，英国的份额又下降为32.8％。以后美国又插足对伊朗石油的掠夺，美国所控制的份额就更大了。
    在1953年美国控制了沙特阿拉伯、“中立地”和巴林群岛石油生产的100％，科威特的50％，伊拉克、卡塔尔和埃及的23％。
    1954年由美国三家石油公司联合组成的“科罗拉多石油公司”又攫取了埃及尼罗河以西的十八万五千平方公里的石油开采权。
    美英在中近东争夺石油的斗争中，使用了各种手段。他们在中近东各国不断组织政变、暗杀和武装挑衅，从而造成这些国家的政治动乱和中近东的紧张局势。
    近年来，在波斯湾地区发现新的油矿，这就引起了美英石油垄断资本集团之间新的尖锐斗争。英国唯恐这些新油矿的开采权落入阿美石油公司的手里，在去年以武力侵占了布赖米绿洲，引起了美英之间新的争执，不久以前在华盛顿举行的美英会谈中，两国在中近东的矛盾和冲突是会谈的中心问题之一。事实证明，它们之间的这种利害冲突并没有得到解决，也不可能得到解决。
