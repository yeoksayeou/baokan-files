Always Pay Attention to Advanced Things and Summarize Advanced Experiences
Chen Lin, Secretary of the Huangmu Township Branch of the Chinese Communist Party in Yangshan County, Guangdong Province

Editor's Note: The emergence of all advanced things often does not attract people's attention and gain their support from the beginning. Therefore, it is a major responsibility of party organizations to always pay attention to discovering and vigorously supporting advanced things. The reason why Huangmu Township in Yangshan County, Guangdong Province, can plant five crops a year and produce 1,000 catties per mu is precisely because the Party branch boldly supports new things in their infancy and is good at summarizing, improving, and promoting the advanced experiences of the masses. The significance of this article lies not only in introducing an advanced experience, but more importantly in illustrating the attitude that party organizations should adopt towards new things.

Our Huangmu Township in Yangshan County is a well-known barren mountainous area in the Dongshan Mountains. It gets cold early and warms up late. Since ancient times, only two crops have been grown a year, one crop of corn and one crop of sweet potatoes, totaling about 600 catties. However, last year we broke this old rule for the first time, advanced the sowing time, and implemented intercropping, resulting in five crops a year, yielding 1,051 catties per mu, an increase of 75% compared to previous years.

Is early sowing based solely on subjective wishes? No, our decision to advance sowing is based on the advanced experience already created by the masses. One basis is that, in July and August 1953, a farmer named Mo Shihuo unintentionally swept a few corn kernels into a water pit. Later, when he watered mustard greens with the water from the pit, he brought 4 corn kernels to the mustard green field. As a result, 4 corn plants grew in the mustard green field, and these 4 corn plants had a bumper harvest in November. Based on this experience, Mo Shihuo broke the routine in July 1954 and planted one-tenth of a mu of corn, which yielded more than 40 catties in November. Based on this experience, we thought, "The weather gets colder day by day from July to November, and corn can still be grown. The weather in spring is getting warmer day by day, so why can't we plant corn earlier?" Another basis is that a farmer named Mo Shunmei tried planting 3 nine-hole beans in the first month of 1954 and later harvested a can of beans. Based on this experience, we thought, "Nine-hole beans are even less cold-resistant than corn, but they can also be sown and grown in the first month, let alone corn?" The branch decided to conduct a typical experiment in the first cooperative of Huangshan District Village, sowing corn three days before the Rain Water solar term. This was 43 days earlier than the local old rule of sowing five days before the Qingming Festival, and about a month earlier than the old habit of sowing five days before the Spring Equinox in the plains. The branch's proposal was opposed by many cooperative members. They either said, "No wheat is sown until the spring breeze arrives" or "Our ancestors for eighteen generations have never heard of it, and we have never seen it in our lives." The branch used the existing concrete facts to persuade and educate them, and finally mobilized the masses to try planting 20 mu of the first crop of corn three days before the Rain Water solar term. The weather was indeed relatively cold at that time. In order to enhance the cold resistance of the seeds, after research, the branch adopted the method of soaking the seeds in warm water and selecting seeds with salt water, as well as mixing 1 catty of lime and half a catty of fire coal ash for every 10 catties of corn seeds. In this way, although the seeds did not germinate for ten days after sowing, they were not damaged by the cold. When the weather turned slightly warmer, the seedlings emerged from the ground. The success of early sowing increased everyone's confidence in striving for a bumper harvest. Then, wood ash was sprinkled on the corn to increase the cold resistance of the seedlings. Later, three consecutive cultivations and fertilizations were carried out to promote the growth of the corn. In this way, the harvest of the first crop of corn began after the Summer Solstice, yielding 210 catties per mu.

In order to strive for planting more crops without affecting the harvest, we intercropped the second crop of corn about half a month before the first crop was harvested. In this way, when the first crop was harvested, the second crop had only grown to four or five inches high, and the first crop would not affect the growth of the second crop. However, when mobilizing to plant the second crop early, resistance arose among the cooperative members. They said that it had always been "no two crops in one plowing" and "if wheat is sown after the Spring Equinox, the grains must be thinned." The branch cited the example of a taro field that often grew more than five kinds of crops and still had a good harvest to illustrate that the saying "no two crops in one plowing" was a manifestation of conservative thinking. In this way, 13 mu were tried, and when harvested five days after the End of Heat solar term, each mu yielded 142 catties. Half a month before the second crop of corn was harvested, the branch mobilized the cooperative members to plant the third crop of sweet potatoes. At this time, according to the old rules, the season for planting sweet potatoes had passed, and some cooperative members did not advocate planting, thinking that even if they were planted, they would only see seedlings but no fruit. The branch cited the fact that someone had missed the farming season more than 20 years ago and planted sweet potatoes late, but still had a harvest, to persuade everyone. As a result, 16 mu were intercropped, and each mu still yielded 615 catties. When the sweet potatoes were about to be harvested, we, based on the experience of harvesting the second crop of corn, mobilized the cooperative members to plant the fourth crop of corn in the sweet potato fields in order to fully utilize the potential of the land. At that time, some cooperative members emphasized that there was no manure to apply, so planting would not result in a harvest; some cooperative members felt that the harvest was already more than last year, so it was not necessary to plant! This led to complacency and relaxation. The branch pointed out to everyone: if there is no manure, manure water can be applied, and if we cannot harvest more, we can harvest less. At the same time, complacency and relaxation were criticized. Everyone was asked to make persistent efforts and strive for more harvest if possible. As a result, the fourth crop of corn also yielded 84 catties per mu. Around the Beginning of Winter solar term, the third crop of sweet potatoes and the fourth crop of corn were harvested, and the branch mobilized the cooperative members to plant winter rapeseed. In this way, thanks to our continuous overcoming of conservative thinking and complacency, we planted five crops a year on one piece of land, greatly increasing the income of the cooperative members.

Due to the success of last year's key experiments, we are now promoting this advanced experience throughout the township. Moreover, in order to improve this advanced experience on the basis of last year's practice, we have formulated a plan to increase production by planting six crops a year this year, and have prepared more fertilizer and are preparing for more meticulous field management, striving to overcome the defect of a lower yield for each successive crop compared to last year. Now, the first crop of corn has already been sown on the day of the Beginning of Spring solar term. We are confident that we will plant one more crop than last year and achieve a higher harvest than last year.

    随时注意先进事物和总结先进经验
    中共广东省阳山县黄木乡支部书记　陈林
    编者按：一切先进事物的产生，常常不是一开始就会引起人们的注意，得到人们的支持的。因此，随时注意发现并且大力支持先进事物，就成了党组织的重大责任。广东省阳山县黄木乡所以能够做到一年种五造，每亩产千斤，正是党支部大胆支持萌芽状态中的新事物，善于总结、提高和推广群众中点滴的零碎的先进经验的结果。这篇文章的意义，不仅仅在于介绍了一项先进经验，更重要的是说明了党组织对待新事物应该采取的态度。
    我们阳山县黄木乡是东山大岭中一个有名的贫瘠山区。冷得早，暖得迟。从古以来，一年只种两造庄稼，一造玉米，一造蕃薯，总共约收600斤左右。可是，去年我们第一次打破了这个从古以来的老规矩，提早了播种时间，并且实行了间作，结果一年种了五造，每亩收了1，051斤，比往年的产量提高75％。
    提早播种，是不是单凭主观愿望呢？不是，我们决定提早播种有群众已经创造出来的先进经验作根据。一个根据是，农民莫师火家里，在1953年七、八月间，无意中把几颗玉米粒扫到一个水坑里，后来用水坑里的水浇芥菜，又把4颗玉米粒带到芥菜地里，结果在芥菜地里就长出4棵玉米来，到11月间这4棵玉米竟丰收了。莫师火家根据这一经验，就在1954年7月间打破常规种了一分地的玉米，结果到11月间又收了40多斤。根据这一经验，我们想，7月到11月的气候一天天的冷下去，还能种玉米，春天的天气是一天天的暖起来，怎么不能提早种玉米呢？另一个根据是，农民莫顺妹1954年正月试种了3粒九孔豆，后来还收得一罐顶豆子。根据这一经验，我们又想：“九孔豆比玉米更不耐寒，也能在正月里下种生长，何况玉米呢？”支部就决定在黄山区村的第一社作典型试验，把玉米提早到雨水前三天播种。这比当地老规矩清明前五天播种提早了43天，比平原地区的老习惯春分前五天播种，提早了一个月左右。支部的提议可遭到了不少社员的反对。他们不是说：“不到春风不种麦”，就是说“祖宗十八代未闻，一辈子未见”。支部就用已有的具体事实进行说服教育，终于发动群众在雨水前三天试种了20亩第一造玉米。当时天气的确比较冷，为了增强种子的抗寒能力，支部研究以后，除采用温汤浸种和盐水选种外，还采用每10斤玉米种子拌石灰一斤、火烟煤半斤的办法。这样，下种以后的十来天，虽未出芽，但种子却没有被冻坏，等到天气稍一转暖，幼苗就露出地面了。早播的成功，增加了大家争取丰收的信心。接着就给玉米撒草木灰，增加幼苗的抗寒能力，以后，又连续作了三次中耕施肥，促进玉米的生长，这样夏至以后，就开始了第一造玉米的收获，每亩产了210斤。
    为了在不影响收获量的前提下，争取多种几造，我们在一造玉米收获以前的半个月左右又间种了二造玉米，这样，在第一造收获的时候，二造才长到四、五寸高，一造不会影响二造的生长。可是在发动提前种二造的时候，社员中又产生了抵触情绪，他们说，古来就是“一耕无二作”“过了春分种麦就要疏粒”。支部就列举出有一块芋头地经常要种五种以上的作物，收成也还不少的事例来说明“一耕无二作”的说法是保守思想在作怪。这样，就试种了13亩，到处暑后五天收获时，每亩产了142斤。当二造玉米收获以前的半个月，支部又发动社员种三造蕃薯。这时按老规矩说，种蕃薯的季节已过，有的社员就不主张种，认为种了也是见苗不见果。支部就举出20多年前有人曾经误了农时晚种了蕃薯但也有收成的事实说服大家。结果间种了16亩，每亩还收了615斤。当蕃薯快要收获的时候，我们根据二造玉米得到收获的经验，为了充分发挥土地的潜力，又发动社员在蕃薯地里种第四造玉米。当时，有的社员强调无粪可上，种上收不上；还有一些社员觉得收成已经比去年多了，不种也罢！产生了自满松懈的情绪。支部就向大家指出：没有大粪，可以上粪水，不能多收，也能少收。同时批判了自满松懈情绪。要大家再接再厉，能多收就要争取多收。结果四造玉米每亩也收了84斤。立冬前后，三造蕃薯和四造玉米收获完毕，支部又发动社员种上了冬油菜。这样，由于我们不断克服了保守思想，克服了自满情绪，就在一块土地上一年种了五造，使社员的收入大大增加。
    由于去年重点试验的成功，今年我们就在全乡推广这一先进经验了。而且，为了把这一先进经验在去年实践的基础上提高一步，我们今年订出了一年种六造的增产计划，并且准备了更多的肥料和准备作更精细的田间管理，努力克服去年一造产量比一造低的缺陷。现在，第一造玉米已经在立春那天下种了。我们有信心比去年多种一造，并且比去年获得更高的收成。
