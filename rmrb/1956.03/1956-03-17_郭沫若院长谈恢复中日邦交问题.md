Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, delivered a radio address on the Central People's Broadcasting Station at 7 p.m. today regarding the issue of restoring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations.

In his broadcast, Guo Moruo said: "Dear Japanese friends: Your 'Month for the Restoration of Japan-China-Soviet Diplomatic Relations' ended yesterday. Tomorrow, you will hold the 'National Congress for the Restoration of Japan-China-Soviet Diplomatic Relations.' Here, on behalf of the Chinese people, I wish your congress success. At the end of last year, I visited your country. During my twenty-odd days there, I fully realized that the early restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, thereby strengthening cultural exchanges and trade between the two countries, is indeed the urgent desire of millions of Japanese people. We, the Chinese people, warmly support your friendly desire."

Guo Moruo said: "The war has been over for ten years now, but there are still no diplomatic relations between China and Japan. This situation is abnormal. Our government has repeatedly proposed to your government to hold talks to restore relations; your people have also repeatedly expressed your positive attitude, demanding the early restoration of Sino-Japanese relations. However, your government, especially those in charge of foreign affairs, has always been evasive and has not expressed a definite attitude. We fully understand Japan's situation. Your country is still occupied by the United States. We deeply sympathize with your difficulties. But we believe that yielding to the United States in everything will never allow Japan to embark on the path of independence and autonomy. I sincerely hope that Japanese politicians can truly represent the will of the Japanese people and truly serve the long-term interests of the Japanese people. This will not only improve the well-being of the Japanese people but also make a great contribution to maintaining peace in Asia and the world."

Guo Moruo concluded: "Regarding strengthening the friendly relations between the peoples of China and Japan, we have been constantly working hard for the past six years and have already done a lot of practical work. In the future, we will continue to work hard and prepare to do more practical work."

    郭沫若院长谈恢复中日邦交问题
    新华社16日讯　中国科学院院长郭沫若今天下午7时就关于恢复中日邦交问题在中央人民广播电台发表广播演说。
    郭沫若在广播中说：亲爱的日本朋友们：你们的“恢复日中日苏邦交月”，在昨天结束了。明天你们就要举行“恢复日中日苏邦交全国大会”，我在这里代表中国人民预祝你们的大会成功。去年年底我曾经访问贵国，在访问贵国的二十几天中，我充分地体会到：早一日恢复中日邦交，从而加强中日两国之间的文化交流和贸易来往，的确是千千万万日本人民的迫切愿望。我们中国人民热烈支持你们的这种友好的愿望。
    郭沫若说：现在战争结束已经十年了，但是中日两国之间还没有邦交，这种状态是不正常的。我国政府不止一次地向贵国政府提出建议：为恢复两国之间的邦交进行商谈；贵国人民也不止一次地表示了你们的积极态度：要求早一日恢复中日的邦交；但是贵国的政府，特别是办外交的人，却始终闪烁其辞，不表示肯定的态度，我们完全了解日本的处境。你们的国家还被美国占领着。对于你们的困难，我们是深切同情的。但是我们觉得事事迁就美国是永远不能使日本走上独立自主的道路的。我恳切地希望日本的政治家能够真正代表日本人民的意志，真正为日本人民的长远利益服务。那样不仅会增进日本人民的福利，同时对于维护亚洲和平和世界和平也会有很大的贡献。
    郭沫若最后说：关于加强中日两国人民的友好关系，我们六年来是不断地在努力的，已经作了不少的实际工作，今后我们也还要继续努力，准备作出更多的实际工作。
