Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, March 4th: Syrian Prime Minister Ghazzi announced in the Syrian Parliament on the evening of March 3rd that Syria, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia are ready to immediately provide Jordan with financial assistance to replace the financial assistance originally from the British side.

Ghazzi said that Egypt and Saudi Arabia authorized him to announce that Syria, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia would regard any aggression against Jordan as aggression against themselves. He said that once such aggression occurs, these three countries will rapidly assist Jordan.

Ghazzi made these remarks during a heated discussion in the Syrian Parliament regarding Jordan's dismissal of Glubb, the British commander of the "Arab Legion". Ghazzi welcomed this measure and said that Syria hopes to see Jordan get rid of all foreign shackles soon.

Xinhua News Agency, Amman: The Jordanian Royal Palace issued a statement on March 3rd stating that Jordan will respect the obligations it has undertaken under the treaty it signed with Britain in 1948.

According to this treaty, which undermines Jordanian sovereignty, Britain has established military bases in Jordan.

Regarding the status of British officers in the "Arab Legion" after Glubb's dismissal, the statement said that British officers belonging to the Arab Legion are fulfilling their duties as experts and instructors for the Arab Legion personnel.
