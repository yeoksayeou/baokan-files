Linxia Region's High Tide of Agricultural Production
    Jia Xing

    The Linxia region of Gansu Province has basically achieved semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization. Immediately following the high tide of cooperativization, a high tide of production emerged in the countryside. All members of agricultural cooperatives in the region are moving forward with full confidence to strive for a regional increase of 100 million jin of grain.

    Farmers often say: "If you want crops to thrive, you must apply plenty of manure." Cooperativization has created favorable conditions for accumulating large amounts of fertilizer. A surge of fertilizer accumulation has swept across the region. Newly built toilets and pens, and newly accumulated soil and manure piles, can be seen everywhere. According to a survey in Ketuo Village, Majiang Township, Linxia County, only 10 out of 29 households in the village used to collect wild manure. After the establishment of the cooperative, every household is collecting wild manure. Now, all cooperatives are looking for fertilizer sources and studying methods for accumulating large quantities of fertilizer. Old stoves and old walls that have been around for decades have been torn down. People are even sweeping pigeon droppings from pigeonholes on cliffs and in sand pits, which no one ever cared about before. Animal bones that no one ever bothered with on hillsides and along ditches have also been picked up. In many areas, a new atmosphere of "no wild manure in courtyards and lanes, no road soil in the middle of the road" has emerged.

    The soil in the Linxia region is very sticky. After autumn plowing, the ground is covered with clods of soil, which must be broken up to retain moisture. Every winter, the fields are filled with farmers holding "wooden mallets" to break up the clods. However, this year is different from previous years. Production teams in the cooperatives have launched competitions and evaluations during labor, resulting in high efficiency and fine quality. According to cooperative members, a single laborer could only break up half a mu of land a day on their own, at most seven or eight fen of land. Now, cooperative members can break up more than one mu of land a day.

    Large-scale winter irrigation is also a new phenomenon in the Linxia region this year. According to statistics from Yongjing County, more than 43,500 mu have been winter-irrigated, and most of the summer fields have been winter-irrigated. Those who did not have the habit of winter irrigation have also begun to winter-irrigate. In the past, water restrictions made it impossible to solve the problem of irrigation, but with cooperativization, this problem has been easily solved. In the past, many lands in the Dongxiang Autonomous County could not be irrigated. During the establishment of the cooperative, channels and dams were merged, and the county's winter irrigation increased by more than 5,000 mu compared to the past.

    Women of all ethnic groups in the Linxia region have never been weaker than men on the labor front. After the establishment of the cooperative, the most prominent performance of women is their active participation in clod-breaking and fertilizer accumulation. In the youth fertilizer accumulation assault team of Ganggou Township, Hezheng County, women accounted for a quarter of the 537 young people. When the Ali Ma Tu water channel was being built in Guangtong Hui Autonomous County, the channels around the villages were contracted by women. In Hedong Township, Yongjing County, while the men participated in the construction of the water channel, the women hauled soil, accumulated fertilizer, and planted trees for afforestation.

    In the high tide of cooperativization and production, the unity between all ethnic groups has also been greatly strengthened. Not only did farmers of all ethnic groups connect and discuss the establishment of cooperatives during the cooperative process, and those who were not in harmony apologized and reflected on each other in the past, but they also helped each other overcome difficulties in production and learning. In Diaoping Village, Xigaomiao Township, Linxia County, during the establishment of the cooperative, 10 Han members helped 7 Dongxiang members to organize manure, and the members of the two ethnic groups became more closely united. In ethnic joint cooperatives, either the Hui and Han members are reasonably divided according to their agricultural and animal husbandry specialties, or the ethnic groups are mixed into teams for joint production, all of which have achieved their strengths and increased their enthusiasm for labor. Cooperativization has created extremely favorable conditions for further strengthening ethnic unity.

    临夏地区的农业生产高潮
    贾行
    甘肃省临夏地区基本上实现了半社会主义农业合作化。紧接合作化高潮，农村又出现了生产高潮。全区农业合作社社员，都信心百倍地为争取全区增产1亿斤粮食而奋勇前进。
    农民常说：“想使庄稼壮，粪土要上旺。”合作化给大量积肥创造了优越的条件，全区普遍地掀起了积肥热潮，到处都可看到新修的厕所、圈棚，新积的土堆、粪堆。据临夏县马集乡科沱村调查，全村29户，往年只有10户拾野粪，建社后，户户都在拾野粪。现在，各社都在寻找肥源和研究大量积肥的方法。几十年的老炕、老墙拆掉了；山崖、砂坑上从来没人理会的鸽洞也来了扫鸽粪的人；山坡、沟沿过去没人理睬过的兽骨也被拣去了。不少地区出现了“庄院巷道无野粪，大道中间无路土”的新气象。
    临夏地区土质粘性大，秋犁以后，就遍地土块，必须打碾保墒。每年冬季，地里到处是手拿“木榔头”的农民在敲打土块。不过今年和往年不同，合作社的生产队在劳动中展开了竞赛评比，效率高，质量细。据社员们谈，单干一个劳动力一天只能打半亩，最多打七、八分地，现在合作社社员一天打一亩多。
    大量浇灌冬水，这也是临夏地区今年的新气象。据永靖县统计，冬灌达43，500多亩，夏田大部灌了冬水。没有冬灌习惯的，也开始冬灌。过去因为水规限制而解决不了的浇水问题，随着合作化也迎刃而解。东乡族自治县过去有很多地灌不上水，建社过程中，实行合渠并坝，全县冬灌比过去增加了5，000多亩。
    临夏地区的各民族妇女，在劳动战线上向来是不弱过男子的。建社以后，妇女最突出的表现是积极地参加了打土块和积肥工作。和政县甘沟乡的青年积肥突击队，537名青年中，女青年就占了四分之一。广通回族自治县在兴修阿里麻土水渠的时候，村庄周围的渠道，是由妇女包干的。永靖县河东乡，男子们参加了修水渠的民工队，妇女们就拉土、积肥、植树造林。
    在合作化高潮和生产高潮中，各民族之间的团结也大大加强了。不仅在建社过程中，各族农民互相串连、商量办社，过去不和睦的互相道歉、检讨，而且在生产、学习中也互相帮助，克服困难。临夏县西高庙乡吊坪村，在建社过程中，10户汉民社员，帮助7户东乡族社员整理了粪土，两民族社员更加亲密团结。在民族联合社，或者按回汉民社员在农牧业上的特长，实行合理分工；或者各民族混合编队，共同生产，都做到了发挥所长，提高了劳动积极性。合作化给进一步加强民族团结创造了极为有利的条件。
