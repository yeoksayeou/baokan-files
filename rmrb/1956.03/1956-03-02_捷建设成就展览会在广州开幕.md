Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 1st. The Czechoslovak Socialist Construction Achievement Exhibition opened today at the Sino-Soviet Friendship Building in Guangzhou.

    Grigor, head of the Czechoslovak government delegation, spoke at the opening ceremony. He introduced various aspects of Czechoslovakia's socialist construction, especially the achievements in industrial development. He believes that it is a great honor to be able to disseminate the knowledge and experience Czechoslovakia has acquired in industrial technology among the fraternal Chinese people. He said that the Czechoslovak people are paying great attention with great sympathy to the efforts made by the People's Republic of China to liberate Taiwan through peaceful means and to establish a collective security system in the Pacific and Asian regions. Therefore, he believes that as long as this exhibition can play any role, even a very small role, in helping China's industrial construction and enhancing China's national strength, the Czechoslovak people will feel infinite joy and gratification.

    Wen Minsheng, Deputy Governor of Guangdong Province, and Ji Chaoding, Vice Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, also spoke. They expressed their heartfelt thanks to the Czechoslovak people on behalf of Guangdong Province, Guangzhou City, and the entire Chinese people, and warmly congratulated the opening of this grand exhibition.

    After Guangzhou Mayor Zhu Guang cut the ribbon, people attending the opening ceremony visited the exhibition. More than 1,500 representatives from leading organs, people's organizations, and troops stationed in Guangzhou, and other units in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City attended the opening ceremony. The Soviet and Polish consuls in Guangzhou also attended the opening ceremony of the exhibition.

    The exhibition received more than 15,000 visitors this afternoon.

    To celebrate the opening of the exhibition, grand banquets were held by both China and Czechoslovakia last night and tonight.

    捷建设成就展览会在广州开幕
    新华社广州1日电　捷克斯洛伐克社会主义建设成就展览会今天在广州中苏友好大厦开幕。
    捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团团长格里哥尔在开幕仪式上讲了话。他介绍了捷克斯洛伐克社会主义建设的各方面的情况，特别介绍了工业发展方面的成就。他认为，能够在像亲如兄弟的中国人民中传播捷克斯洛伐克在工业技术方面所掌握的知识和经验，是莫大的光荣。他说，捷克斯洛伐克人民以极大的同情注意着中华人民共和国为争取通过和平方式解放台湾和为争取在太平洋和亚洲地区建立集体安全体系所作的努力。因此，他认为，只要这个展览会能对帮助中国工业建设、增强中国的国家力量方面起任何一点作用，那怕是十分微小的作用，捷克斯洛伐克人民将感到无限的愉快和欣慰。
    接着讲话的还有广东省副省长文敏生和中国国际贸易促进委员会副主席冀朝鼎。他们代表广东省、广州市和全中国人民向捷克斯洛伐克人民表示衷心的感谢，并热烈祝贺这个盛大的展览会的开幕。
    在广州市市长朱光剪彩以后，参加开幕仪式的人们参观了展览会。参加开幕仪式的有广东省和广州市的领导机关、人民团体及驻广州市部队等单位代表1，500多人。苏联和波兰驻广州领事也出席了展览会开幕仪式。
    展览会在今天下午接待了观众15，000多人。
    为庆祝展览会开幕，昨晚和今晚中捷双方还先后举行了盛大的宴会。
