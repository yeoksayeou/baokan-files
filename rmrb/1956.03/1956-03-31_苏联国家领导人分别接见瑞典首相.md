Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 30th -- TASS reports: The Swedish Prime Minister Erlander, who was invited by the Soviet government to visit the Soviet Union, held a press conference in Moscow on the 29th.

Erlander first expressed his satisfaction with the warm reception he received in Moscow. He hoped that this visit would consolidate the ties between Sweden and the Soviet Union.

Answering reporters' questions, Erlander said that he believed that direct meetings between the national leaders of the two countries were of great significance. Such meetings could provide an opportunity to discuss issues of mutual interest. He also felt that it was very beneficial to understand the economic and technological development of a large country like the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union had achieved many successes in technology and had successfully solved the problem of training technical cadres. Sweden is currently exploring ways to solve this task.

When asked how Sweden would ease international tensions, Erlander said that Sweden had not joined a military alliance, but it did not want to be isolated from the world. It strives to promote the easing of international tensions through its actions in the United Nations. Scientific cooperation in the field of atomic energy should also be developed within the framework of the United Nations. Sweden is very interested in this cooperation. Countries like Sweden would benefit greatly from such cooperation. In this regard, Sweden is also happy to cooperate with the Soviet Union. In early April, seven prominent Swedish physicists will visit the Soviet Union. Sweden has already sent similar delegations to the United States and the United Kingdom.
