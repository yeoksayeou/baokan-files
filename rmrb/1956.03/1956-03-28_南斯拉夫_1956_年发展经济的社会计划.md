    Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, March 27th: According to the Yugoslav News Agency, Belgrade, Yugoslav Federal Executive Council Vice-President Vukmanović, on March 26th, reported on this year's social plan (general development plan) at a joint session of the two houses of the Yugoslav Federal People's Assembly.

    He said that the social plan for this year stipulates that industrial production will increase by 10% compared to 1955, of which the production of equipment and other capital goods will increase by 4%, and the production of means of reproduction will increase by 12%. The production of consumer goods will increase by 10%. Most of this increase in industrial production will be achieved by increasing labor productivity.

    The total investment this year will reach 346 billion dinars. Economic investment accounts for 70.5% of the total investment, investment in industry and mining accounts for 44.9% of the total investment, and agricultural investment will account for 7.1% of the total investment. The basic purpose of agricultural investment is to increase agricultural production in order to reduce food imports from foreign countries and reduce the deficit on the payment account.

    Vukmanović said that according to the plan, Yugoslavia's exports this year will increase by 17% compared to last year. After restoring commercial and economic relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, Yugoslavia trades with almost all countries in the world. The tendency to develop trade and economic relations with other countries in many ways is a lasting direction of Yugoslav economic policy.

    When talking about the past development of the Yugoslav economy, Vukmanović pointed out two basic characteristics: the rapid development of productive forces and the construction of basic industries.

    In terms of economic development, increasing industrial production occupies a primary position. Industrial production has increased to 2.5 times that of the pre-war period. Basic industries have gained special development. Now, the proportion of industry and mining in the national income has increased from 18% before the war to more than 40%. Yugoslavia has changed from an industrially underdeveloped agricultural country into a country with a relatively developed industry as a solid foundation for further development.

    Vukmanović emphasized that in the past three years, economic policies have been changed in order to eliminate the shortcomings caused by the country's rapid industrialization. He said that in the period from 1953 to 1955, the production of consumer goods in industry increased by 14% annually; agricultural investment increased by more than 70%.

    When talking about the personal consumption of residents, Vukmanović said that personal consumption in 1955 increased by 12.6% compared to 1952.

    Finally, Vukmanović emphasized that the fundamental task of this year's economic policy is to further develop production and productivity to the highest limit. In view of the experience of previous years, the fundamental issue of the economic policies we will adopt is to eliminate the phenomenon of uneven development in certain industrial sectors (especially those related to agriculture), increase labor productivity, and take measures to accelerate the stabilization of the domestic market.

    南斯拉夫1956年发展经济的社会计划
    新华社27日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社贝尔格莱德讯：南斯拉夫联邦执行委员会副主席伏克曼诺维奇，三月二十六日在南斯拉夫联邦国民议会两院联席会议上就今年的社会计划（一般发展计划）作了报告。
    他说，今年的社会计划规定的工业生产量将比1955年增加10％，其中设备和其他资本货的生产量将增加4％，再生产物资的生产量将增加12％。消费品的生产量将增加10％。工业生产的这种增加大部分将靠提高劳动生产率来实现。
    今年的投资总数将达到三千四百六十亿第纳尔。经济方面的投资占整个投资的70.5％，工业和采矿业方面的投资占整个投资的44.9％，农业投资将占整个投资的7.1％，农业投资的基本目的是增加农业生产，以便减少从外国的粮食进口，减少支付账上的赤字。
    伏克曼诺维奇说，按照计划，今年南斯拉夫的出口要比去年增加17％。在同苏联和东欧国家恢复了商业和经济关系后，南斯拉夫就差不多同世界各国进行贸易了。多方面发展同其他国家的贸易和经济关系的倾向是南斯拉夫经济政策的持久方向。
    伏克曼诺维奇在谈到南斯拉夫经济过去的发展的时候，指出了两个基本特点：生产力的迅速发展和基本工业的建设。
    在经济发展方面，提高工业生产占有首要地位。工业生产已经增加到战前的二点五倍。基本工业获得了特别的发展。现在，工业和采矿业在国民收入中的比重已经由战前的18％提高到40％以上。南斯拉夫已经从一个工业不发达的农业国家变成为一个有比较发达的工业作为进一步发展的巩固基础的国家。
    伏克曼诺维奇着重指出，在过去三年中，经济政策有了改变，以便消除由于国家的迅速工业化而产生的缺点。他说，在1953到1955年这个时期中，工业中生产的消费品的生产每年增加14％；农业的投资增加了70％以上。
    伏克曼诺维奇在谈到居民的个人消费量时说，1955年个人消费量比1952年增加了12.6％。
    最后，伏克曼诺维奇着重指出，今年经济政策的根本任务是进一步把生产和生产力发展到最高限度。鉴于以往各年的经验，我们将要采取的经济政策的根本问题，是消除某些工业部门（特别是同农业有关的）发展不均衡的现象，提高劳动生产率和采取加速稳定国内市场的措施。
