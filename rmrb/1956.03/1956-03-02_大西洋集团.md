    The Atlantic Group
    Soviet Union, Varga
    The policies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have a great impact on the situation in Europe and the world. The nature of this impact is clearly demonstrated in the resolutions of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting held in December 1955, which stipulate that the Atlantic Group's armies should be armed with atomic weapons, that the Group's air force strength in Europe should be increased by one-third, and that the remilitarization of West Germany should be accelerated. In other words, it means continuing to expand armaments and increase military budgets. These resolutions are correctly understood by peace-loving people all over the world as measures to deepen tensions in Europe.
    The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has been a source of tension from the very beginning. Much has been said and written about this group in recent years, but, strangely enough, the full text of the Atlantic Treaty has never been published. In any case, the officially published parts of the treaty, especially the actual activities of the Atlantic Alliance, have revealed its main characteristics.
    First, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is an aggressive military alliance with its spearhead pointed at the Soviet Union and the entire democratic camp. This was openly acknowledged in 1954 when the member states of this alliance rejected the Soviet Union's proposal to join the alliance under certain conditions. Naturally, Western countries could not allow the peace-loving Soviet Union to become an ally of an alliance that, for them, is an instrument of aggressive policy.
    There is also the fact—which is generally not emphasized—that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization includes all colonial powers: the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Portugal (only Spain remains outside the alliance, but it has direct military ties with the United States). The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is the central pillar for the colonial powers to prop up the dying colonial system.
    Finally, the obvious fact is that the United States plays a dominant role in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, while other countries are in a subordinate position.
    All member states of this group are obliged (under Article 5 of the treaty) to participate in a war launched by any one of them. Of course, the treaty only speaks of repelling attacks on the territory of member states, or attacks on their foreign troops. But, as past experience has fully shown, nothing is easier than provoking an "incident" and portraying aggression as a defense against aggression. Thus, on the most important foreign policy issue—war or peace—Western European countries have virtually lost their independence: the United States can at any time launch an "attack" on its own troops and drag its allies into a war to pursue the greater interests of the U.S. arms industry. Such interests are irrelevant to and even in conflict with these countries.
    All the European members of this alliance are forced to place part of their land and naval forces under American command: the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces in Europe is an American general; the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's navy in the Atlantic is commanded by an American general [1]. The joint West European air defense scheduled to be established in 1956 will also be commanded by Americans.
    The leadership core of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's military organization—the Standing Committee of the Military Committee, composed of representatives of the chiefs of staff of the United States, Britain, and France—is permanently headquartered in Washington. The military budgets of the member states are effectively controlled by the United States.
    European countries have to provide territory to the United States as air [2] and naval bases; they have to provide barracks, strategic railways and highways, and underground oil pipelines connecting ports and airports, etc., or let the Americans build these facilities themselves. And the costs are collectively borne by all member states. In fact, the European countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have given up most of their sovereignty.
    The U.S. military bases in North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries are extraterritorial zones, where U.S. law, not the law of the host country, prevails. U.S. officials have unlimited power in these areas. Little news is published about these bases. We learned the following details from a pro-American book [3] written by a Swiss bourgeois journalist, who was allowed by the U.S. authorities to visit a huge arsenal near Bordeaux.
    The arsenal is surrounded by a restricted zone 6 kilometers deep. French gendarmes are stationed every 200 meters. 500 French elite troops under the command of a field officer guard the outer perimeter of the area, which is 12 kilometers across. The inner area is guarded by American soldiers. French soldiers are not allowed inside. Even officers of the French General Staff can only enter with special permission. The inner area is 4 kilometers wide, with a U.S. army camp in the center.
    An American soldier earns $80 a month, plus food and equipment. Converted into francs, this is more than the average monthly income of a French factory worker. A French soldier's monthly salary is only equal to an American soldier's daily salary.
    Similarly huge U.S. military warehouses are located near La Rochelle, Verdun, Metz, Tours, and elsewhere. Due to the U.S. airbases, the U.S. has 50,000 troops stationed in France.
    The situation that this author involuntarily reveals in his detailed account shows that Americans are the masters in France, while the French in their own country have become second-class citizens. Americans demand the same rights as extraterritorial rights, privileges that Europeans enjoyed in some Asian countries in the last century—the privilege of enforcing their own laws on foreign soil.
    It is easy to imagine what feelings this situation evokes in the French people, a nation with a thousand-year history and highly developed culture, science, literature, and art. They naturally see the American troops as invaders and conquerors.

           ×××

    The American diplomatic community regards the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as the greatest achievement of American post-war policy. If there is any truth in this regard, the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is merely an achievement of the American policy of expansion in Western Europe. In fact, the idea of a Western European alliance was first proposed by Britain. Britain originally wanted to lead the Western European countries to work together, first to protect the colonial system; second, to resist the increasingly obvious American offensive to seize world hegemony; third, to form a united front against the Soviet Union and other countries in the socialist camp; and fourth, to prevent West Germany from becoming a strong competitor.
    But World War II weakened Britain's strength, and it did not have enough economic and military power to lead a Western European organization. Leadership passed to the United States, and under its auspices, the aggressive Atlantic Alliance was established as an instrument of American "position of strength" policy.
    Britain's original intention of acting as an alliance to defend against American expansion and prevent the growth of German power was abandoned. The main role of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is to serve as a weapon against the Soviet Union and other countries in the democratic camp. Under the pretext of organizing a defense against the Soviet Union, the United States seized control of the military forces and military expenditures of other countries in the alliance and began to build naval and air bases and weapons depots on their territories and colonies. From the very beginning, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has been an instrument of the Cold War, creating suspicion and distrust for many years and poisoning the international atmosphere.
    American diplomacy has been frantically strengthening and expanding the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. "The Atlantic family," "Western solidarity," and similar concepts are constantly being promoted. But within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, cracks are gradually forming and deepening, and sometimes, this "Atlantic family" backfires. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization not only undermines trust between East and West, but it even disrupts normal relations between its member states.
    Under the influence of the Soviet Union's consistent peace policy, people in Western Europe are increasingly recognizing that it is not necessary to pay the huge military expenditures that the United States has imposed on them under the pretext of defending against "Soviet aggression," nor is it necessary to maintain large armies and long-term military service, nor is it necessary to provide American military bases, because there is no slightest evidence of any Soviet threat. This explains why the European countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are increasingly rejecting American demands, for example, the Scandinavian countries are refusing to allow the construction of military bases on their territories and are implementing shorter terms of service than the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in America would like.
    At the same time, Western European countries are frightened by the idea that the United States would launch a third world war, turning Western Europe into a battlefield, causing a holocaust of life and property due to the use of modern weapons.
    Although there is no doubt that the American people do not want war, the European allies are alarmed by the activities of a small group of powerful leaders in the United States who, as Dulles made clear in his interview with "Life" magazine, base their policies on constant threats of war. Western European countries are apprehensive because influential generals such as Radford, Carney, and MacArthur openly or implicitly advocate "preventive war." People in Western Europe are increasingly aware that behind these spokesmen stand powerful monopoly groups, who, in order to obtain huge profits from military orders, advocate keeping their people in constant fear of war and insist on the insane path of keeping the world on the "brink of war." The Atlantic Alliance and Atlantic policy are becoming increasingly unpopular in all countries of Western Europe. This was clearly demonstrated in the elections to the French National Assembly held on January 2, in which the parties that had pursued Atlantic policies suffered a crushing defeat.
    The danger of being dragged into a third world war against their will and caused by Washington's reckless policies frightens most politicians in the European countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, because for these countries, war would only bring huge destruction and the collapse of the capitalist system. The desire of the Western European people for peaceful coexistence between the two systems and their distrust of American policy have become so obvious that they are shaking the foundations of the aggressive Atlantic Alliance.
    In the past few years, there has been a significant change in the relative economic strength of Western Europe compared to the United States. Western Europe has overtaken the United States in terms of the speed of industrial development. As a result of the 1953-54 crisis, American industrial production has fallen by 10%. The United States' share of world capitalist production has fallen from 58.6% in 1947 to 49.4% in 1954.
    In the early post-war years, the economies of most Western European countries relied on the United States to supply food, raw materials, coal, and other commodities. Now Western European products are competing equally with American products in world markets. In 1947, American exports were $15.4 billion, while Britain, France, West Germany, and Italy together only exported $9.4 billion. In 1954, American exports fell to $15.1 billion, while these four Western European countries increased to $18.5 billion, exceeding American exports by 20%. This correspondingly reduced the "dollar shortage," and some countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization gradually accumulated their gold and foreign exchange reserves.
    The relative decline of the American economy compared to other major countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has made the former more resistant to the American manipulation of everything in the Atlantic Group. Some countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are refusing American "aid."
    After World War II, only two large imperialist countries remained: the United States and Britain. The contradictions between these two countries, now as before World War II, are the main contradictions in the imperialist camp, despite their military alliance (the North Atlantic Treaty Organization) and the constant assurances of "eternal friendship" that their political leaders give each other. Their competition for sources of raw materials, spheres of influence, and product sales markets is constantly intensifying, and it will be more strongly exposed when the first period of the world economic crisis of overproduction finally arrives.
    It is no secret that the aim of American policy, directed by Wall Street interests, is to undermine the British Empire and end or at least weaken the imperial preferential system. We know that the United States has driven Britain out of the Ruhr and has deprived it of its monopolistic control over Iranian oil. There is also the undeniable fact that the United States uses high tariffs, "Buy American" propaganda, and other methods to prevent the import of British goods. The British economy is also severely damaged by the American-inspired restrictions on trade with the socialist camp.
    Economic competition inevitably leads to political conflict. Despite Washington and London's united "position of strength" policy against the Soviet Union, despite the Atlantic Alliance, they have not been able to formulate a common policy towards China. The United States stubbornly refuses to recognize China with astonishing stubbornness. It deprives the People's Republic of China of its legitimate seat in the United Nations. It finances the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan (according to official figures published by "Business Conditions" magazine, it has reached $118,000 million by mid-1955). In short, its policy is to maintain tension in the Far East, where it maintains a large army and navy in the Far East—in Japan, the Philippines, and South Korea. As for Britain, since World War II has weakened its economy, it cannot bear the heavy burden of military expenditure demanded by the United States (which is reflected in the increased inflation), and it wants to make certain changes in its policy in the Far East.
    The contradictions between the United States and France are also not insignificant. France was openly driven out of South Vietnam by the United States. The European Defense Community plan, which the United States had painstakingly put together, was undermined by France.
    There are similar contradictions between France and West Germany. The painstakingly drafted Saar Agreement was also completely shattered by a referendum. It seems that the Saar will soon pass into the hands of West Germany, which will give West Germany a greater advantage than France in terms of heavy industry—the foundation of economic and military power—and further exacerbate the existing contradictions.
    These and many other contradictions are weakening the Atlantic Alliance, despite Washington's efforts to strengthen it. Moreover, Washington's policy of forcing Western European countries to submit to American manipulation is bound to sharpen contradictions. It will inevitably shake America's position in Western Europe and deepen its isolation.
    The movement of Western European people to defend peace and national sovereignty is one of the most important factors hindering the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
    Another factor is the liberation movement of colonial peoples. Half of the French army is stationed in North Africa, including several divisions formally under the control of the American Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces. British troops have been tied down in Kenya, Malaya, and elsewhere for years.
    National movements also play a significant role in weakening the Atlantic organization. Britain is fiercely fighting with Greece over the Greek island of Cyprus, which is replacing Suez as Britain's main military base in the Near East, and Britain is unwilling to let go. The British army uses all kinds of terror and intimidation against the people of Cyprus: martial law, shootings, and even whipping primary school students who participate in anti-British demonstrations.
    The relationship between Greece and Turkey can also be seen from the violent incidents against Greece in Turkey. Sometimes, the British, Turkish, and Greek alliance under the cover of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization looks like a farce. Greece has drawn certain conclusions from this: it has refused to participate in North Atlantic Treaty Organization military exercises.
    Although the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is being shaken by the factors listed above, it would be wrong to underestimate the real harm of this aggressive alliance in international affairs. It is a serious threat to world peace. Its activities, its existence, undermine trust between countries and are a consistent source of suspicion and tension. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is a major obstacle to an effective system of collective security in Europe.
    This is the most important point. That is why all those who long for lasting world peace and security and who long for good relations between countries, especially neighboring countries, abhor the Atlantic Alliance. Therefore, it can be expected that the proposals contained in the Prague Declaration of the Warsaw Treaty countries will be warmly welcomed in Western Europe. This is especially true for the proposal to establish a region in Europe, including both parts of Germany, with limited and supervised armaments, and to establish good and friendly neighborly relations, especially between the Soviet Union, Turkey, Bulgaria, Greece, Albania, Italy, Czechoslovakia, and the Federal Republic of Germany. The implementation of these proposals will undoubtedly contribute to the consolidation of world peace.

    [1] The United States wanted to command the entire navy of the member states, but Britain strongly opposed it. Finally, a compromise was reached, according to which the British naval defense was assigned to the British Home Fleet; the navy in the Mediterranean was commanded by a British general, but the American Mediterranean Fleet was not under his jurisdiction.
    [2] The United States has a total of 40,000 air force personnel in Britain.

    大西洋集团
    苏联　瓦尔加
    北大西洋公约组织的政策对于欧洲和全世界的局势发生很大的影响。这种影响的性质清楚地表现在1955年12月举行的北大西洋公约组织理事会会议的决议中，这些决议规定以原子武器武装大西洋集团军队，增加这个集团在欧洲空军力量的三分之一，并且加速使西德重新军国主义化。换句话说，那就是继续扩充军备和增加军事预算。这些决议被全世界和平爱好者正确地了解为加深欧洲紧张局势的措施。
    北大西洋公约组织从一开始起就一直是紧张局势的根源。人们最近几年来关于这个集团说了许多话和写了许多文章，但是，有点奇怪的是，大西洋公约的全文从来没有公布过。不管怎么样，已经正式公布的公约的部分，特别是大西洋联盟的实际活动已经使它的主要特点显露出来了。
    首先，北大西洋公约组织是一个矛头对着苏联和整个民主阵营的侵略性军事联盟，这一点是1954年这个联盟的成员国拒绝苏联在某种条件下参加这个联盟的建议的时候所公开承认的。自然，西方国家不能够让爱好和平的苏联成为对他们来说是侵略政策工具的联盟的盟友。
    还有这样的事实——它一般是不被人强调——那就是北大西洋公约组织包括了所有殖民国家：美国、英国、法国、比利时、荷兰和葡萄牙（只有西班牙仍然留在联盟以外，但是它同美国有直接的军事联系）。北大西洋公约组织是殖民国家撑持垂死的殖民制度的中枢。
    最后，明显的事实是，美国在北大西洋公约组织中起着支配的作用，而其他国家则处于从属的地位。
    这个集团的所有成员国都有义务（根据公约的第五条）参加由它们中间的任何一国发动的战争。当然，这个条约只说到击退对成员国领土的攻击，或者是对它们国外军队的攻击。但是，如过去的经验所充分表明的，再也没有比挑起一个“事件”而把侵略说成是反对侵略的防御更容易了。这样，在最重要的外交政策问题上——战争或者和平——西欧国家实际上已经丧失了他们的独立：美国可以随时对它自己的军队发动一个“攻击”而把它的盟国拖进一场为美国军火企业追求更大利益的战争中去。这种利益是同这些国家毫不相干和甚至对立的。
    这个联盟的全体欧洲成员国被迫把它们的一部分陆军和海军置于美国指挥之下：北大西洋公约组织驻欧洲军队的总司令是美国将军；北大西洋公约组织驻在大西洋的海军是由美国将军指挥的〔一〕。预定于1956年建立的西欧联合空防同样也将由美国的人指挥。
    北大西洋公约组织的军事组织的领导核心——由美国、英国和法国的参谋总长代表所组成的军事委员会常设委员会——常设总部设在华盛顿。成员国的军事预算实际上是由美国控制的。
    欧洲国家不得不把领土供给美国作空军〔二〕和海军基地；它们要提供兵营、战略铁路和公路以及连结港口和飞机场的地下输油管等等，或者让美国人自己来建筑这些设施。而费用则是由所有的成员国集体负担。事实上，北大西洋公约组织的欧洲国家已经放弃了他们大部分的主权。
    美国在北大西洋公约组织国家的军事基地是治外法权区域，在这些地方，是美国的法律而不是所在国的法律起支配地位。美国官员在这些地区有无限的权力。有关这些基地的消息是很少发表的。我们从瑞士资产阶级新闻记者著的一本亲美国的书〔三〕中知道了如下的一些详细情形，这位新闻记者得到美国当局的允许，参观过波尔多附近的一个巨大的军火库。
    这个军火库的周围有纵深6公里的一个禁区。每隔200公尺就有法国宪兵站岗。在一位校官指挥下的500名法国精锐部队守卫着这个地区外围纵横12公里的地带。内区则由美国士兵守卫。法国兵不准入内。甚至法国参谋部的军官也只有得到特别许可才能够进去。内部地区有4公里宽，中央是一片美国兵营。
    一个美国士兵每月的薪金80块美元，另外还有口粮和装备。折成法郎，这比法国工厂工人每月平均的收入还要多。法国士兵一个月的薪水只等于美国士兵一天的薪水。
    同样巨大的美国军事仓库位于靠近拉罗舍尔、凡尔登、麦次、都尔和其他地方。由于美国的空军基地，美国在法国驻有5万军队。
    这位作者在他详细的叙述中非出自本心所透露出来的情况表明，在法国的美国人是主人，而在他们自己的国土上的法国人倒成了二等公民。美国人要求等于治外法权的同样权利，而这种权利是上一个世纪中欧洲人在某些亚洲国家所享有的特权——在外国土地上实施他们自己法律的特权。
    人们很容易想像得到，这种情况对于国家有上千年历史而有着高度发展的文化、科学、文学和艺术的法国人会引起什么样的感情。他们很自然地把美国军队看作是侵略者和征服者。
           ×××
    美国外交界认为北大西洋公约组织是美国战后政策的最大成就。假如说在这方面多少还有点真实的话，北大西洋公约组织的建立只不过是美国在西欧扩张政策的一个成就。事实上，西欧联盟的主张最初是由英国提出的。英国原想领导西欧国家齐心合力，第一是保护殖民制度；第二是抵抗已日益显著的美国夺取世界霸权的攻势；第三是组成反对苏联和社会主义阵营其他国家的联合战线；第四是阻止西德成为一个强大的竞争者。
    但是第二次世界大战削弱了英国的力量，它没有足够的经济和军事力量来领导一个西欧组织。领导权转到美国手中，在它的主持下，侵略性的大西洋联盟作为美国“实力地位”政策的工具成立了。
    英国原来打算作为防御美国扩张，阻止德国力量增长的联盟的这种作用被抛弃了。北大西洋公约组织的主要作用是作为反对苏联和民主阵营其他国家的武器。美国在组织对付苏联的防御的借口之下，夺取了联盟其他国家的军事力量和军事支出的控制权并且开始在他们的国土和殖民地建筑海空军基地和武器仓库。北大西洋公约组织从一开始就成为冷战的工具，多年来一直制造怀疑和不信任，毒化国际气氛。
    美国的外交一直发狂地加强和扩大着北大西洋公约组织。“大西洋大家庭”，“西方团结”以及类似的观点经常在被宣传着。但是在北大西洋公约组织中，裂缝逐渐形成并且逐步加深，有时候，这个“大西洋大家庭”适得其反。北大西洋公约组织不仅损害东西方的信任，而且它甚至破坏着它的成员国之间的正常关系。
    西欧的人们在苏联一贯的和平政策的影响下，越来越认识到没有必要付出美国在防御“苏联侵略”的借口下强加于他们身上的庞大军事支出，没有必要维持庞大的军队和长期的军事服役，也没有必要提供美国军事基地，因为根本没有任何苏联威胁的丝毫证据。这说明为什么北大西洋公约组织的欧洲国家日益拒绝美国的要求，例如，斯堪的纳维亚国家拒绝准许在它们的国土上建筑军事基地以及实行了远非北大西洋公约组织美国总司令所愿意的较短的服役期限。
    同时，西欧国家被这样一种想法所惊吓：美国会发动第三次世界大战，把西欧变成为战场，由于使用现代武器而造成生命财产的浩劫。
    虽然美国人民不要战争，这是毫无疑问的，但是欧洲的盟国对于美国一小撮有势力的领导人物的活动却感到惊慌，这些人物，如杜勒斯对“生活”杂志的谈话所明白表示的，是把他们政策的基础放在一贯的战争威胁上。西欧国家由于雷德福、卡涅和麦克阿瑟等这样有影响的将军公开地或者隐晦地宣传“预防性战争”而惶惶不安。西欧的人们日益认识到在这些发言人的后面站着有势力的垄断集团，它们为了从军事定货中取得丰厚的利润，主张使它们的人民处于经常的战争恐惧中并且坚持着使世界处于“战争边缘”的疯狂路线。大西洋联盟和大西洋政策在西欧所有的国家中越来越不受欢迎。在1月2日举行的法国国民议会的选举中清楚地证明了这一点，在这次选举中，曾经执行大西洋政策的党派遭到了惨败。
    被卷进违反它们的意志而由于华盛顿轻率的政策而引起的第三次世界大战的危险，使北大西洋公约组织欧洲国家的大多数政治家害怕，因为对这些国家来说，战争只会带来巨大的破坏和资本主义制度的崩溃。西欧人民要求两种制度的和平共处的愿望和他们对美国政策的不信任已变得如此明显，以至要动摇侵略性的大西洋联盟的基础。
    在过去的几年中，西欧同美国的相对的经济力量是有着显著的变化的。西欧在工业发展的速度上赶过了美国。由于1953—54年危机的结果，美国工业生产已经下降10％。美国在世界资本主义生产中占的比重已由1947年的58.6％下降到1954年的49.4％。
    在战后最初几年，西欧大多数国家的经济依靠美国供给粮食、原料、煤和其他的商品。现在西欧的生产品同美国的生产品在世界的市场上势均力敌地竞争着。1947年，美国的输出是154亿美元，而英国、法国、西德和意大利一共才输出了94亿美元。1954年，美国输出跌到151亿美元，而这四个西欧国家则增加到185亿美元，超过美国输出20％。这相应地减少了 “美元荒”，而北大西洋公约组织的一些国家逐渐地积存它们的黄金和外汇储备。
    同其他北大西洋公约组织主要国家比较，美国经济的相对下降使前者更强硬地抵抗美国在大西洋集团中的操纵一切的行为。一些北大西洋公约组织国家拒绝美国的“援助”。
    在第二次世界大战之后，大的帝国主义国家只剩下两个：美国和英国。这两个国家之间的矛盾，现在和第二次世界大战之前一样，是帝国主义阵营中的主要矛盾，尽管他们有军事联盟（北大西洋公约组织）和他们的政治领袖们不断地互相给予“永久友好”的保证。他们对原料来源、势力范围和产品销售市场的竞争不断地加剧，当生产过剩的第一期的世界经济危机最后到来的时候，它将会更强烈地暴露出来。
    由华尔街利益所主使的美国政策的目的在于动摇英帝国，并且结束或者至少是削弱帝国的优惠制度，这已不是什么秘密了。我们知道美国已经把英国从鲁尔赶出去，已经剥夺了它对伊朗石油的垄断的控制权。还有无可争辩的事实是：美国用高额关税壁垒、“买美国货”的宣传和其他办法阻止英国货物的输入。英国的经济而且严重地受到美国授意限制同社会主义阵营贸易的损害。
    经济竞争不可避免地导向政治冲突。尽管华盛顿和伦敦在反对苏联的“实力地位”政策中联合起来，尽管有大西洋联盟，他们还是不能够制定出对中国的共同政策。美国抱着令人惊奇的顽固态度硬不承认中国。它剥夺中华人民共和国在联合国的合法席位。它资助台湾的蒋介石集团（据“商业现况”杂志发表的官方数字，到1955年年中已达到118，000万美元之多）。总之，它的政策是在远东保持紧张局势，它在远东——在日本、菲律宾和南朝鲜维持着庞大的陆海军。至于英国，由于第二次世界大战削弱了它的经济，它不能够承担美国要求的军事支出重负（这表现在加剧的通货膨胀中），它要在远东的政策中有某些改变。
    美国和法国之间的矛盾也并不是不严重的。法国在南越被美国公然地赶出来。美国曾经费尽心机搞起来的欧洲防务集团计划被法国所破坏。
    在法国和西德之间也有类似的矛盾。煞费苦心拟订出来的萨尔协定也被公民投票彻底地粉碎。看来萨尔转到西德之手，时间也不会太长，这会使得西德比法国在重工业方面——经济和军事力量的基础——有更大的优势，并且进一步地加剧现存的矛盾。
    这一些和其他许多矛盾正在削弱大西洋联盟，尽管华盛顿竭力想加强它。不仅如此，华盛顿强迫西欧国家屈从于美国操纵的政策必然使矛盾尖锐化。它将不可避免地动摇美国在西欧的地位，加深它的孤立。
    西欧保卫和平和民族主权的人民运动是妨碍北大西洋公约组织最重要的因素之一。
    另外一个因素是殖民地人民的解放运动。法国陆军的一半驻扎在北非，其中包括正式在北大西洋公约组织军队美国总司令控制下的几个师。英国军队数年来一直被牵制在怯尼亚、马来亚和其他地方。
    民族运动在削弱大西洋组织方面同样也起着显著的作用。英国同希腊为了希腊的塞浦路斯岛而激烈地斗争着，塞浦路斯是代替苏彝士成为英国在近东主要的军事基地的，英国不肯放手。英国陆军对塞浦路斯人民使用各种恐怖和威吓的手段：戒严、枪杀，甚至鞭打参加反英示威的小学生。
    希腊和土耳其的关系也可以从在土耳其反对希腊的暴力事件中看出来。有时候，在北大西洋公约组织掩护下的英、土、希联盟看起来像是一出滑稽剧。希腊已经从这里面得到某种结论：它已经拒绝参加北大西洋公约组织军事演习。
    虽然北大西洋公约组织正在被列举过的这些因素所动摇，但是轻视这个侵略联盟在国际事务中的真正危害，那将是错误的。它是对世界和平的严重威胁。它的活动，它的存在破坏着国家之间的信任，是猜疑和紧张局势的一贯的根源。北大西洋公约组织是欧洲集体安全有效制度的一大障碍。
    这是最重要的一点。这就是为什么所有渴望持久的世界和平和安全以及渴望各国之间、特别是邻国之间的良好关系的人们都憎恶大西洋联盟的原故。因此，人们可以预料得到，华沙条约国家的布拉格宣言中所包含的建议将会在西欧得到热烈的赞成。这特别是对于规定在欧洲建立一个军备受限制和监督的包括德国两部分在内的地区的建议，和建立良好的友邻关系，特别是苏联，土耳其，保加利亚，希腊，阿尔巴尼亚，意大利，捷克斯洛伐克和德意志联邦共和国之间的关系。实现这些建议将无疑地有助于世界和平的巩固。
    〔一〕美国要指挥成员国的全部海军，但是英国坚决不赞成。最后达成一个折衷方案，根据这个折衷方案，英国的海防分配给英国国内舰队；地中海的海军由英国将军指挥，但是美国地中海舰队不受他的管辖。
    〔二〕美国在英国的空军人员共有4万人。
