Our Party has always valued the role of youth in national life and socialist construction, regarding youth as our hope and future. In the field of literature and art, the Party has also constantly taught us to attach great importance to cultivating and supporting the healthy growth of new forces, and to constantly fight against the bourgeois aristocratic style of those who suppress new forces. The National Youth Literary Creation Conference held in the capital embodies this policy of the Party.

The National Youth Literary Creation Conference has specifically shown us the strong potential of the new literary force. The approximately five hundred delegates who participated in the conference, as well as more amateur youth authors of various ethnic groups who have emerged from workers, peasants, soldiers, students, teachers, and office staff, constitute a vigorous force in the entire literary creation ranks, injecting new blood into our socialist literary cause. Such active amateur youth writing is a phenomenon unprecedented in Chinese history. At this conference, young authors clarified the correct direction of adhering to amateur writing, clarified the importance of going deep into the struggle of life and studying Marxism and various kinds of knowledge, and also learned some valuable experiences related to life practice and creative practice from older writers. The conference was a success.

There is no doubt that the vigorous growth of a large number of new literary forces is one of the important factors for the prosperity and development of our socialist literary cause. It is not enough to rely solely on the existing small team of writers to meet the people's growing demands for literature. Therefore, vigorously cultivating young authors and expanding the ranks of writers is an important task before us. The work of cultivating new literary forces is a common cause of society and requires the joint efforts of all parties.

Many young authors have received enthusiastic help and care from the Party and administrative leaders and trade unions and Communist Youth League organizations in their factories, mines, rural areas, troops, schools, and offices, and have received correct guidance and support on the road to writing. The encouraging achievements we see now are inseparable from the work of these comrades and organizations. Unfortunately, there are still many areas and units whose leaders and trade unions and Communist Youth League organizations do not pay attention to or care about this work. Some one-sidedly believe that legitimate amateur writing will inevitably distract energy and delay work; others, indiscriminately, regard amateur writing as an individualistic pursuit of fame and gain, and therefore reject, discriminate, satirize, and attack it. It should be understood that the literary and artistic cause is an important part of the entire revolutionary cause, and the work of cultivating new literary forces is also a part of the entire revolutionary work. It is wrong to regard literature as a personal interest and therefore restrict young authors. We should actively support young authors, enthusiastically guide them onto the right path, and create conditions conducive to writing and learning under the principle of not hindering work. At the same time, we should especially strengthen the ideological education of young authors to prevent the erosion of bourgeois ideology, which is the due responsibility of the Party and administrative heads of every region and unit, as well as trade unions and Communist Youth League organizations.

Of course, writers' associations, federations of literary and art circles, newspaper and magazine (especially youth newspapers and magazines and literary and art magazines) editorial departments, and publishing houses should become the main departments for cultivating young authors. Cultivating young authors is one of the basic tasks of these departments and an important aspect of measuring the quality of their work. We must be good at discovering and supporting the creative enthusiasm of young authors and give them concrete and meticulous help with enthusiasm and patience. We must eliminate the cold, hypercritical, and bad attitude towards young people's works. It should be pointed out that the erroneous idea of worshiping celebrities and despising unknown people still appears in various forms in the above-mentioned departments. Only by thoroughly eliminating this erroneous idea can young authors have the opportunity to come to the fore. At the same time, we should also oppose the vulgar style of helping seedlings grow by pulling them up, exaggerating them excessively, and the wrong practice of transferring young authors away from their original jobs too early, thus separating them from life. Enthusiastic support should be combined with strict requirements.

The enthusiastic help and guidance of writers is an important factor in promoting the rapid growth of young authors. There were good examples in the past, and this conference has also made a good start. However, among some writers, we can still hear some complaints, believing that this is an "extra burden" that will hinder their own creation. It should be understood that young authors are the inheritors of our socialist literary cause, and they will hold up this banner and continue to move forward. All writers who regard the literary cause as a revolutionary cause should regard helping young authors as their unshirkable responsibility.

Young literary creators should cherish their initial achievements, but do not let them go to their heads, and should not regard them as a source of pride. It should be understood that this little achievement is not only extremely small for the entire revolutionary cause, but also only a beginning for the literary cause they are engaged in. First of all, young authors should conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism, constantly improve their class consciousness and communist moral character, and improve their political and ideological level and ability to understand life; they should demand that they first be an advanced socialist builder, a person with high moral character and good qualities, who can actively and creatively complete the work of their posts and serve the people wholeheartedly, and always be vigilant against any exaggeration and complacency. For anyone, pride is the starting point of failure. Young literary creators should adhere to amateur writing, invest in the various fiery struggles of socialist construction with full political enthusiasm, boldly intervene in life, and deeply study life. Do not float on the surface like duckweed, and do not easily leave their original jobs. Young literary creators should realize that literary creation is an extremely arduous labor, which is forever unrelated to those who aim high and want to take petty advantages. We should strive to learn and master the creative method of socialist realism, improve our ability to express ourselves, and hone our artistic skills. "The student surpasses the teacher," on the one hand, young authors should humbly learn from their predecessors, and at the same time, they should aspire to catch up with and surpass their predecessors in creation.

Young literary creators, on your shoulders, you are shouldering a major responsibility, that is, to work with writers across the country to create works worthy of our country and people, so that the achievements of our literary creation are commensurate with the achievements of our country in other aspects. Only in this way can we live up to the cultivation and expectations of the Party and the people for you.

New forces on the literary front, move forward bravely!

### 前进，文学战线上的新军

    前进，文学战线上的新军
    我们的党从来就重视青年在国家生活和社会主义建设事业中的作用，把青年看作是我们的希望和未来。在文学艺术事业方面，党也是时时刻刻教导我们要十分重视培养和扶植新生力量的健康成长，要时时刻刻同那些压制新生力量的资产阶级贵族老爷作风作斗争。全国青年文学创作者会议在首都的召开，正体现着党的这个方针。
    全国青年文学创作者会议向我们具体地显示了文学新军的雄厚的潜在力量。五百名左右参加会议的代表以及更多的从工人、农民、战士、学生、教师、机关工作人员中涌现出来的各族青年业余作者，组成了整个文学创作队伍里的一支生力军，他们为我们的社会主义文学事业注入了新的血液。青年业余写作这样活跃，是我国历史上从来没有的现象。在这次会议里，青年作者们明确了坚持业余写作的正确方向，明确了深入生活斗争和学习马克思主义、学习各种知识的重要性，也从老作家们那里学习到一些有关生活实践和创作实践的宝贵经验。会议是有成就的。
    毫无疑问：大批文学新军旺盛地成长，是我国社会主义文学事业繁荣和发展的重要因素之一。仅仅靠现有的一支很小的作家队伍，是不能满足人民对于文学的日益增长的要求的。因此，大力地培养青年作者、扩大作家队伍，是摆在我们面前的重要任务。而培养文学新军的工作，是社会的共同事业，需要各方面一起来做。
    许多青年作者曾经得到他们所在的厂矿、农村、部队、学校、机关的党、行政领导人和工会、青年团等组织的热情的帮助和关怀，在写作的道路上得到他们的正确的指引和支持。现在我们所看到的这些令人鼓舞的成绩，是同这些同志和组织的工作分不开的。可惜的是，目前还有不少地区、单位的领导人员和工会、青年团组织，不重视、不关心这一工作，有的片面地认为正当的业余写作也一定会分散精力、耽误工作；有的不分青红皂白，把业余写作一律看成是个人主义名利观点，因而加以排斥、歧视、讽刺和打击。要知道：文学艺术事业是整个革命事业的重要组成部分，培养文艺新军的工作也就是整个革命工作的一部分。把文学看成是个人兴趣因而对青年作者加以限制的思想和行为，是错误的。应该积极地扶植青年作者，热情地将他们引上正路，在不妨碍工作的原则下，为他们创造一些有利于写作和学习的条件。同时，应该特别加强对青年作者的思想教育，防止资产阶级思想意识对他们的侵蚀，这是每一个地区、单位的党、行政负责人和工会、青年团组织的应有的责任。
    当然，作家协会、文联、报刊（特别是青年报刊和文艺报刊）编辑部和出版社，应该成为培养青年作者的主要部门。培养青年作者是这些部门的基本任务之一，是衡量它们工作好坏的一个重要方面。要善于发现和扶植青年作者的创作积极性，满怀热情地、耐心地给以具体的、细致的帮助。必须肃清对青年作品的冷酷的、吹毛求疵的恶劣态度。应该指出：在上述这些部门中，崇拜名人、轻视无名小卒的错误思想，仍在以各种形式出现。只有彻底肃清这种错误思想，青年作者才有可能冲到上面来。同时，也应该反对拔苗助长、过分揄扬的庸俗作风和过早地把青年作者调离原工作岗位、因而使他们脱离生活的错误做法。热情的扶植应该同严格的要求相结合。
    作家们的热心帮助和指导，是促进青年作者迅速成长的重要因素，这方面过去有好的范例，这次会议上也有了好的开始。但是，在某些作家中，也仍然可以听到一些抱怨之声，认为这是“额外负担”，会妨碍自己的创作。要知道青年作者是我们社会主义文学事业的继承者，他们要撑持着这面大旗继续前进。凡是把文学事业看作革命事业的作家，都应该把帮助青年作者当作自己的义不容辞的职责。
    青年文学创作者们应该珍惜自己最初的成就，但是不要被它冲昏头脑，更不应该把它看成骄傲的资本。要知道，这一点成就不但对整个革命事业来说，是极微小的，对于自己所从事的文学事业来说，也只是一个开始。首先，青年作者应该认真地学习马克思列宁主义，不断地提高自己的阶级觉悟和共产主义道德品质，提高自己的政治思想水平和理解生活的能力；应该要求自己首先是一个先进的社会主义建设者，一个道德高尚品质优良的人，能够积极地、创造性地完成本岗位的工作，全心全意为人民服务，时时刻刻警惕着任何的虚夸和自满。对于无论什么人，骄傲都是失败的起点。青年文学创作者应该坚持业余写作，要以饱满的政治热情，投入社会主义建设的各种火热的斗争，大胆地干预生活，深入地研究生活，不要像浮萍一样飘在水面，不要轻易地脱离原有的工作岗位。青年文学创作者应该认识到文学创作是极其艰苦的劳动，它永远与好高骛远、想占小便宜的人无缘。应该努力学习掌握社会主义现实主义的创作方法，提高表现能力，锤炼艺术技巧。“青出于蓝而胜于蓝”，青年作者们一方面要虚心向前辈作家们学习，同时要立志在创作上赶上和超过前辈作家们。
    青年文学创作者们，在你们的肩上，正担负着一个重大的责任，这就是要同全国作家们一起，创造出无愧于我们的国家和人民的作品，使我们的文学创作的成绩同我们国家的其他方面的成就相称。这样才不负党和人民对于你们的培养和期望。
    文学战线上的新军们，勇敢地前进吧！
