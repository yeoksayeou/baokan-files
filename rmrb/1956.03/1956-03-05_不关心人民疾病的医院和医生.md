    Hospitals and Doctors Who Do Not Care About People's Diseases
    To the Editor:
    Article 26 of the "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft)" proposed by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China stipulates that within 7 or 12 years, the most serious diseases endangering the people should be basically eliminated in all possible places, and other diseases should also be actively prevented and treated. We were very excited when we saw this happy prospect. However, a serious incident of health authorities not caring about the people's health has recently occurred in Jingyuan Hui Autonomous County, Gansu Province.
    In Shanan Village, Yuanzi Township, Jingyuan Hui Autonomous County, measles began to spread in September 1955. However, because the county health authorities did not take necessary preventive measures, the measles spread to the entire township, and children died. When this disease was discovered, the Yuanzi Township People's Committee wrote to the County Health Center seven times and sent people to the Health Center three times to ask for a doctor, but the Health Center was slow to send a doctor. Later, although the Health Center sent three doctors one after another, these doctors only stayed in the township for a few hours and left without doing any work. Ma Jiaji, a staff member of the County Health Section, came to the countryside to inspect the work, but he did not even enter the gate of the Township People's Committee before returning. Later, the Yuanzi Township Branch of the Communist Party of China and the county committee staff assisting the branch put forward their opinions to the county health authorities twice, and the county health authorities then sent traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Li Defu and Jin Guangzhou, a nurse from the County Health Center, to stay in Shanan Village for more than 10 days. More than a month later, Dr. Zeng Yongzai from the province and Yang Jisheng from the County Health Center came again. Although these medical personnel came, they treated the masses' diseases with an irresponsible attitude. After they came to the township, a lot of work was waiting for them to do, but they were busy playing poker and singing kuaiban all day long, and did not treat the children well. For example, Ma Changjun's child was sick for more than 20 days, and the condition worsened after treatment by the doctor; however, when the child went to see the doctor for the second time, Dr. Zeng Yongzai actually said, "This child has no disease," and refused to treat him, and as a result, the child died. Ma Wanlin's child was very sick, and the doctor said he needed an injection and medicine. Ma Wanlin had little money on him, and he was short 1 jiao when paying for the medicine. The doctors closed their box and left. The irresponsible working attitude of these doctors aroused widespread dissatisfaction among the masses, and the township branch and the township people's committee protested to them, but they unreasonably shirked their responsibilities.
    The health authorities and these medical staff in Jingyuan Hui Autonomous County have adopted such an irresponsible attitude towards the people's health. How can they earnestly implement the National Agricultural Development Program? We hope that the leading organs will seriously deal with this matter and give the relevant derelict personnel the punishment they deserve.

### 不关心人民疾病的医院和医生

    不关心人民疾病的医院和医生编辑同志：
    中共中央政治局提出的“1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要”（草案）第26条规定，要在7年或者12年内，在一切可能的地方基本上消灭危害人民最严重的疾病，对于其他疾病也要积极防治。我们看到这种幸福的远景以后，都感到非常兴奋。但是，我们甘肃省泾源回族自治县最近却发生了一件卫生机关不关心人民身体健康的严重事件。
    泾源回族自治县园子乡沙南村，从1955年9月开始流行了麻疹，但是因为县卫生机关没有采取必要的预防措施，以致使麻疹蔓延到全乡，并且发生了儿童死亡的现象。在发现这种疾病的时候，园子乡人民委员会先后给县卫生院写了7次信，并且3次派人到卫生院去请大夫，可是卫生院却迟迟不派大夫来。后来卫生院虽然先后派来了三位大夫，但是这些大夫都是只在乡里住了几小时，没有做什么工作就走了。县卫生科的科员马家基下乡来检查工作，也是连乡人民委员会的门都没有进就回去了。后来，中共园子乡支部和协助支部工作的县委会工作人员两次向县卫生机关提出意见，县卫生机关才派了中医李得富和县卫生院护士金光宙来到沙南村住了10多天。过了一个多月，又来了省里的曾永再大夫和县卫生院的工作人员杨吉生。虽然来了这些医务人员，但是他们却以不负责任的态度对待群众的疾病。他们来到乡里以后，很多工作都等待着他们去做，可是他们却整天忙着打扑克、唱快板，而不好好给孩子们治病。例如，马长俊的小孩病了20多天，经大夫治疗以后病情更加严重了；但是当孩子第二次去看病的时候，曾永再大夫竟说“这孩子没有什么病”，不给治疗，结果孩子就病死了。马万林的小孩病得很严重，大夫说要打针吃药，马万林身边的钱少，付药费的时候差了1角钱，大夫们把箱子一关就走了。这些大夫的不负责任的工作态度引起了群众的普遍不满，乡支部和乡人民委员会向他们提出了抗议，他们还无理地推卸责任。
    泾源回族自治县的卫生机关和这些医务工作人员，对人民的身体健康采取了这样不负责任的态度，他们怎么能够认真执行全国农业发展纲要呢？我们希望领导机关严肃处理这件事情，并且给有关失职人员以应得的处分。
