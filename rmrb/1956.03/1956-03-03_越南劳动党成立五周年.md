    The Fifth Anniversary of the Founding of the Vietnam Workers' Party
    Today is the fifth anniversary of the founding of the Vietnam Workers' Party. The Vietnam Workers' Party and its predecessor, the Indochinese Communist Party, are the great organizers and inspirers of the Vietnamese people's struggle for independence and peace. Armed with the theory of Marxism-Leninism, the Indochinese Communist Party and the Vietnam Workers' Party correctly applied the experience of the revolutionary struggle of the colonial people, leading the Vietnamese people from victory to victory in a long and arduous struggle.
    The Indochinese Communist Party and the Vietnam Workers' Party have traveled a glorious road. The founding of the Indochinese Communist Party in 1930 greatly changed the revolutionary situation in Vietnam at that time, enabling the Vietnamese people's revolution to enter a new stage under the leadership of the working class. During World War II, it led the Vietnamese people in a heroic struggle against Japanese imperialism. In 1945, the Indochinese Communist Party led the Vietnamese people to launch an armed uprising, winning the brilliant victory of the "August Revolution," shattering the shackles of colonial rule, and establishing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. When the French colonialists re-launched an aggression against the young Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Indochinese Communist Party mobilized and led the people of the whole country in a heroic struggle to defend the independence of the motherland and the peace of Indochina.
    Under the new situation, the Vietnam Workers' Party was founded on March 3, 1951. The Vietnam Workers' Party inherited the fine traditions of the Indochinese Communist Party and the Vietnamese people's revolution, united all the people of Vietnam, persisted in eight years of heroic resistance, and frustrated the French colonialists' plan to re-dominate Vietnam. Thanks to the victorious struggle of the Vietnamese people and the efforts of peace-loving countries, peace was finally restored in Indochina.
    Since the restoration of peace, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has made remarkable achievements in restoring the national economy. At present, the Vietnam Workers' Party is leading the Vietnamese people in their efforts to realize the "1956 National Plan." The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has always adhered to a peaceful foreign policy and made its own contribution to maintaining peace and easing international tensions. The cooperation between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and other countries in the socialist camp is growing stronger, and its international status is rising. In particular, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has made unremitting efforts to maintain and implement the Geneva Accords. The South Vietnamese authorities, with the support of the United States, have refused to hold free general elections, prepared to hold unilateral elections, and conspired to drag South Vietnam into a military alliance, thereby re-igniting the war in Indochina. In this situation, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam recently advocated reconvening the Geneva Conference to ensure the implementation of the Geneva Accords and to achieve the unification of Vietnam through free general elections.
    The great achievements made by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in various aspects, both internally and externally, are inseparable from the correct leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party. The Vietnam Workers' Party follows the principles of Marxism-Leninism, unites all patriotic forces in Vietnam around itself, and enables the Vietnamese people to achieve brilliant victories in all aspects of the struggle to maintain peace and build the country.
    The people of China and Vietnam have a traditional friendship. Today, this fraternal friendship is even closer. The consolidation and development of friendly relations between the Chinese and Vietnamese people is a guarantee for strengthening the socialist camp and maintaining world peace. As the Vietnam Workers' Party celebrates its fifth anniversary, the Chinese people wholeheartedly congratulate the Vietnam Workers' Party on achieving greater victories in leading the Vietnamese people in peaceful construction and consolidating peace, achieving unification, and completing the struggle for independence and democracy.

    越南劳动党成立五周年
    今天是越南劳动党成立五周年纪念日。越南劳动党和它的前身印度支那共产党，是越南人民争取独立与和平斗争的伟大组织者和鼓舞者。以马克思列宁主义理论武装起来的印度支那共产党和越南劳动党，正确地运用了殖民地人民革命斗争的经验，领导越南人民在长期艰苦的斗争中，从胜利走向胜利。
    印度支那共产党和越南劳动党走过了光荣的道路。1930年印度支那共产党的成立，大大改变了越南当时的革命形势，使越南人民革命在工人阶级的领导下，进入了崭新的阶段。第二次世界大战期间，它领导越南人民对日本帝国主义进行了英勇的斗争。1945年，印度支那共产党领导越南人民举行武装起义，取得了“八月革命”的辉煌胜利，打碎了殖民统治的枷锁，建立了越南民主共和国。当法国殖民者对年轻的越南民主共和国重新发动侵略以后，印度支那共产党又动员并领导全国人民为捍卫祖国的独立和印度支那的和平而进行了英勇的斗争。
    在新的形势之下，越南劳动党于1951年3月3日成立。越南劳动党继承了印度支那共产党和越南人民革命的优良传统，团结越南的全体人民，坚持了八年的英勇抗战，挫败了法国殖民者妄想重新统治越南的计划。由于越南人民的胜利斗争和爱好和平国家的努力，印度支那终于恢复了和平。
    和平恢复以后，越南民主共和国在恢复国民经济方面取得了显著的成绩。目前，越南劳动党正在领导越南人民，为实现“1956年国家计划”而努力。越南民主共和国政府一向坚持和平外交政策，为维护和平、缓和国际紧张局势作出了自己的贡献。越南民主共和国同社会主义阵营其他国家的合作日益加强，它的国际地位日益提高。特别是在维护和贯彻日内瓦协议方面，越南民主共和国政府进行了不懈的努力。越南南方当局在美国支持下拒绝进行自由普选，准备举行片面选举，阴谋把南越拖入军事联盟，从而重新挑起印度支那的战争。在这种情况下，越南民主共和国政府最近主张重新召开日内瓦会议，保证日内瓦协议的实施，通过自由普选实现越南国家的统一。
    越南民主共和国在对内对外各方面所获得的巨大成就，是同越南劳动党的正确领导分不开的。越南劳动党遵循着马克思列宁主义原则，把越南一切爱国力量团结在自己的周围，使越南人民在维护和平和建设国家的各方面斗争中都获得辉煌的胜利。
    中越两国人民有着传统的友谊。今天，这种兄弟般的友谊更加亲密。中越人民友好关系的巩固和发展，是加强社会主义阵营、维护世界和平的保证。当越南劳动党庆祝自己诞生五周年的时候，中国人民衷心祝贺越南劳动党在领导越南人民进行和平建设和巩固和平、实现统一、完成独立和民主的斗争中取得更大的胜利。
