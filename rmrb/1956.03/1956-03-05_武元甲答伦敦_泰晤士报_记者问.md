    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 3rd: Vietnam News Agency reported on March 3rd: General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnam People's Army, answered questions posed to him by Jerome Caminata, a reporter from the London "Times".

    Vo Nguyen Giap first pointed out that the South Vietnamese authorities are violating the Geneva Accords regarding the consolidation of peace and the prevention of the resurgence of hostilities, retaliating against former resistance personnel, and preparing for unilateral elections. He said that the foundation of the Geneva Accords is being undermined by the South Vietnamese authorities. Peace is being threatened. All of this is due to the open intervention of the United States, and the consistently passive attitude of the French government, which, as a signatory to the agreement, should and could have done more.

    Vo Nguyen Giap said, "We believe it is urgent that the countries participating in the Geneva Conference and the member states of the International Supervisory and Control Commission should do everything possible to ensure that the Geneva Accords are respected."

    In response to a question about whether the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes it can currently reduce its armed forces, Vo Nguyen Giap said, "Now that peace has been restored, our army is currently participating in the cause of building the motherland along with the people. Part of our army has already been demobilized."

    "However, we must also consider the situation created by the South Vietnamese authorities' violation of the Geneva Accords."

    武元甲答伦敦“泰晤士报”记者问
    据新华社河内3日电  据越南通讯社3日讯：越南人民军总司令武元甲将军回答了伦敦“泰晤士报”记者杰罗姆·卡密那塔向他提出的问题。
    武元甲首先指出，越南南方当局正在违反日内瓦协定中关于巩固和平和防止敌对行动再起的条款，对前抗战人员进行报复，并且准备片面选举。他说，日内瓦协定的基础正在受到越南南方当局的破坏。和平正在受到威胁。所有这一切都是由于美国的公开干预，由于法国政府一向采取的消极态度，而法国政府作为协定签字国，本来应该并且可能多做一些事的。
    武元甲说，我们认为迫切的是，参加日内瓦会议的国家和国际监督和监察委员会的成员国应该竭尽全力以便使日内瓦协定得到尊重。
    在答复关于越南民主共和国是否认为能够在目前减少它的武装部队的问题时，武元甲说，现在和平已经恢复，我们的军队目前正在和人民一道参加建设祖国的事业。我们的军队一部分已经复员。
    但是，我们也应该考虑到南越当局违反日内瓦协定所造成的局势。
