    Soviet Expedition in Antarctica
    Soviet Doctor of Physics and Mathematics A. Gusev
    In the Frozen Wilderness
    The Soviet expedition has been on the Antarctic coast for two months now. Since January 15th, all efforts have been concentrated on unloading cargo from the ships and building "Peace" Village.
    A village is being built on the rocks. The first batch of houses has been assembled. All members of the expedition, including the scientists, have been mobilized to unload and build.
    In the limited spare time, scientists are taking advantage of the current 24 hours of daylight to continue studying the environment around the construction site. Biologists and photographers are very fortunate: not far from where the ships are docked, a group of Emperor penguins has been found on the coastal ice. This penguin is rare even in Antarctica. It is a huge bird, over one meter tall and weighing up to sixty kilograms. They live on the Antarctic coast all year round, incubating their chicks during the harsh winter. Now they are moulting and feeding chicks that look like walking fluff balls. Biologists have the opportunity to directly observe the little-known lives of these rare birds.
    Flying Over the Oasis
    On January 22nd, the leaders of the expedition took advantage of good weather conditions to send an aerial expedition to the Antarctic oasis area.
    The first oases were discovered by the German expedition in 1939. The oases within our exploration area—between 80 degrees and 105 degrees east longitude—were first discovered by the Byrd expedition in 1948. However, the data on this oasis is very scarce, and there are also different views on its origin.
    Compared with the surrounding ice sheet, the scenery of the oasis is extraordinary. Its dark brown, not-too-high (about 100 to 200 meters high) mountain tops are shrouded in a thin mist. Cumulus clouds hang above, the kind that usually appear over the Ukrainian steppes and other temperate regions at midday on clear summer days. It feels like rain will fall from the clouds immediately. The oasis lives its unique life in its special climatic conditions.
    The entire crew of the helicopter led by Inozemtsev spent considerable effort in transporting equipment and personnel to the selected campsite. But the pilots successfully completed this task. The helicopter flew confidently among the hills, landing on poorly conditioned landing sites in the small basins between them.
    The view from the helicopter was dreamlike. It immediately reminded one of the fjords of the north and the high mountain regions with snow-capped peaks and lakes, and when we flew over the hills without snow, water, and plants, it even seemed like we were seeing the imagined landscape of the moon.
    Beyond the glaciers surrounding the oasis are real rivers. They flow into lakes with bizarre shapes. Countless tributaries and bays seem to have dyed the low-lying areas of the oasis a layer of blue. The small ponds densely distributed among the hills also appear blue-green. In the north there is a larger pond, one side of which is connected to the Shackleton Glacier, and possibly also to the sea through the Shackleton Glacier. Small icebergs float on the surface of the pond. Brown rocks, white and light green patches of glaciers, blue, light blue, and green lakes—such an irreplaceable colorful picture unfolded before the eyes of the helicopter passengers.
    The oasis is a small hilly area, fifty kilometers long and about fifteen kilometers wide. The mountain peaks are composed of native rock, and the slopes are covered with stones brought by glaciers. There was a time when this place was entirely covered with ice.
    There are alkaline lakes and freshwater lakes, and the water temperature fluctuates between four and nine degrees. The bottom of the lake is up to twenty-six meters deep. Water samples for chemical analysis were taken from various depths. Some small organisms and algae were found in the water samples. Fish and seals were found in the large pond. This is solid evidence of its connection to the sea.
    The research results show that the oasis was created because the climate in these areas began to warm up at some point in the past. The terrain and the location of the glaciers helped it to escape the covering of ice and snow. After reaching a certain size, the oasis itself began to affect the surrounding glaciers. Further research will show what stage the oasis is in: is it expanding or shrinking, or maintaining the status quo.
    On January 30th, the expedition returned to the construction site of the meteorological station. The Soviet air force has opened up broad possibilities for scientists to study the inaccessible areas of Antarctica.
    Raging Wind
    The bad weather that always comes arrived this year on February 3rd. The storm shattered the firm ice around the construction site and in those places where many icebergs were frozen. Also, a road from the ship through the coastal ice cliff to the construction site was pushed into the sea. The barges, which were extremely necessary for unloading, were also carried away with the ice near the shore. Icebergs began to move and approach the ships, so the "Ob" immediately left the shore and sailed into the sea.
    When the weather improved, the "Ob" sailed towards the "Lena", which was moored between fixed icebergs, because there were more stable anchoring conditions there. The plane searched for the barges all day, and it was not until the evening that the "Ob" towed them to the unloading site. At this time, after the storm, the coastal ice around the construction site plunged straight into the water, forming a vertical ice wall as high as thirty meters, so the effort to start unloading the ship failed again. Just as the ship was about to approach the ice wall, it was blocked by an iceberg. Bad weather came again, and the ship stayed in the trap for two days and nights, until it finally broke the ice in front of it before it could sail back into the sea. The unloading work of the ship was seriously threatened.
    At this time, the No. 7 refrigerated ship sailed into the Davis Sea. It stopped near an ice floe. In order to guide this small ship, which was not suitable for sailing in ice, the "Lena" sailed out. It brought the refrigerated ship back the next day, and the work of unloading grain could no longer be delayed. At this time, planes and helicopters flew to the refrigerated ship, which was faintly visible among the distant icebergs, and they landed on the firm ice near the ship, transporting valuable food to the polar station. This situation lasted for several days.
    Construction work began to be hampered by the interruption of unloading. Somov, Kolt, P. Zhanninov, Lisitsyn and I, taking advantage of the improved weather, took a small boat along the ice wall in order to determine whether the ship could directly approach the ice wall. In another small boat, a group led by Zakopailo measured the depth of the ice wall and the path leading to it.
    The ice wall overlooked the sea like a huge cliff of wind-blown snow. Finally, a section that was not too high, only fifteen to twenty meters high, and the cliff was not too dangerous, was found. The next day, Somov, Golubev, Greku, and Gusev went to that place along the coast. In order to prevent collapse accidents, we were tied together with thin ropes and probed the ice cliff with ice picks, marking the boundaries of safe passage and the locations for installing mooring equipment in the snow pits. On February 9th, the experienced icebreaker captain Vitrov bravely sailed the "Lena" towards the ice barrier. We, tied with ropes, climbed to the edge of the cliff and held the first ship rope thrown from the bow. The increasingly strong wind stubbornly drove the ship away, hindering the mooring work. Only when the protruding part of the ice blocking the passage was blown up, could the stern be close to the ice wall. In the evening, the mooring work was completed, and we boarded the ship along the gangway used during storms.
    Unloading began that night. The unloading site was generally not bad, but it was not safe: all precautions had to be taken because the ship itself was under the cliff.
    The sailors, scientists, and builders on the "Lena" set an example of selfless labor, unloading 800 tons of cargo in one day and night under these complex conditions. The decision to greet the opening of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union with the cargo unloaded from the ship encouraged everyone.
    The National Flag is Raised
    February 13th was a commemorative day. The national flag of the first Soviet meteorological station was raised on the Antarctic coast.
    The masts of the ship moored next to the ice wall were decorated with flags of various colors. In the middle of the growing town, on the square where the rocks overlapped, stood the podium. The order was given: "Attention to the Soviet flag!" Somov raised the flag. Thus, the national flag proudly fluttered in the fields of the Antarctic continent against the background of majestic icebergs. Helicopters and planes flew over the podium. Somov spoke, talking about the determination of all members of "Peace" Village to complete the glorious task assigned by the Party and the government. The captain and the builders all made reports. The Soviet national anthem was solemnly sung. With unanimous consent, a congratulatory telegram was sent to the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. After the meeting, everyone immediately went to work. The construction of "Peace" Village continued at a high speed.

    苏联考察队在南极
    苏联物理数学博士  阿·古谢夫
    在冰天雪地中
    苏联考察队来到南极洲海岸已经是第二个月了。从一月十五日起，就集中一切力量来起卸船上的货物和建设“和平”村。
    岩石上正在建筑村镇。第一批房屋已经装配起来。考察队的全体人员，包括科学家在内，都动员起来从事卸货和建设。
    在不多的闲暇时间里，科学家们利用目前一天二十四小时都是白天的机会，继续研究建筑工地周围的环境。生物学家和摄影师非常幸运：距离船只停泊的地方不远，在沿岸的坚冰上发现了一群大帝企鹅。这种企鹅甚至在南极都是罕见的。这是一种巨大的鸟，身高一公尺以上，重达六十公斤。它们整年住在南极洲海岸上，在严酷的冬季孵育雏鸟。现在它们脱换了羽毛并哺育像能走动的绒球一样的雏鸟。生物学家有机会直接观察这些稀有的鸟的很少为人知道的生活。
    绿洲上空飞行
    考察队的领导人在一月二十二日利用良好的天气条件，派遣了一个空中考察队到南极绿洲地区去。
    第一批绿洲是德国的考察队在1939年发现的。在我们考察地区内——东经八十度到105度之间——的绿洲是别尔德考察队在1948年首先发现的。但是，关于这个绿洲的资料是很贫乏的，同时，关于它的起源的看法也有分歧。
    同四周的冰原比起来，绿洲的景色是异乎寻常的。它的暗褐色的、不太高的（约一百到二百公尺高）山巅笼罩着薄雾。上面停着积云，这种积云通常在晴朗的夏日的中午出现在乌克兰草原和温带其他地区的上空。似乎感到马上就会有雨从云层落下。绿洲生活在它的气候条件特殊的生活中。
    伊诺捷姆采夫率领的直升飞机上的全体人员，在把人们装备和仪器转运到已经选定的宿营地时，曾费去不小的力气。但是飞行员成功地完成了这项任务。直升飞机很有把握地在丘陵间曲折飞行，在它们之间的小块盆地上的条件很坏的降落场上着陆。
    从直升飞机上看到了梦幻般的景色。它马上使人想到北方的峡湾和有着雪峰和湖泊的高山地区，而当我们飞临没有雪、水和植物的丘陵上空的时候，甚至像是看到了想像中的月球的景色。
    过了绿洲四围的冰川就是真正的河流。它们流入一些具有奇异的形状的湖泊。无数的支流和港湾好像给绿洲的低洼处染上了一层蓝色。密布在丘陵之间的不大的池沼，看来也是蓝绿色的。在北面有一个较大的池沼，它的一边同沙克尔顿冰川相接，而且，通过沙克尔顿冰川可能还同大海连接起来了。一些不大的冰山漂浮在池面。褐色的山岩，冰川的白色的、淡绿色的斑点，蓝色的、淡青色的、绿色的湖泊——这样一幅不可再得的彩色画图展开在直升飞机乘客的眼前。
    绿洲是一个小丘陵区，长五十公里，宽约十五公里。山顶由本生岩构成，山坡布满了由冰川带来的石块。从前有个时候这里曾经全部被冰覆盖着。
    有硷水湖也有淡水湖，水的温度上下于四度到九度之间。湖底深达二十六公尺。从各种深度取得了化学分析水样。在水样中发现了一些小生物和藻类植物。在大池沼中发现了鱼和海豹。这是它同海相连的确切证据。
    研究结果表明，绿洲是由于这些地区的气候在以前某个时候开始变暖而产生的。地势、冰川的位置，促使它摆脱了冰雪的覆盖。绿洲本身在达到一定的范围以后，就开始影响周围的冰川。进一步的研究将会表明绿洲是处在什么时期：是在扩大还是缩小，或者维持现状。
    一月三十日，考察队回到气象台的建设地点去。苏联的飞机队为科学家们研究南极洲难以达到的地区开辟了广泛的可能性。
    狂风怒号
    照例要来的坏天气今年是二月三日开始的。暴风吹碎了建设地点周围和那些冰里冻结有许多冰山的地方的坚冰。还有一条从船上通过海岸冰崖到建设地点的道路被推到海里去了。卸货工作极端需要的驳船也同岸边坚冰一起被带走了。冰山开始移动并迫近船只，于是“鄂毕号”立即离岸驶向海中。
    当天气变好的时候，“鄂毕号”驶向停泊在固定的冰山之间的“勒拿号”，因为那里有比较安定的投锚条件。飞机整天在找寻驳船，直到晚上，“鄂毕号”才把它们拖向卸货地点。这时，在暴风以后，建设地点周围的海岸冰径直坠入水中，形成了一个高达三十公尺的垂直冰壁，因此，试图开始起卸船上货物的努力又失败了。船只刚要驶近冰壁，却被冰山挡住了去路。坏天气又来了，船在陷阱里呆了两个昼夜，直到终于击破了前面的冰以后才能再度驶进大海。船只卸货工作受到了严重的威胁。
    这时，第七号冷藏船驶进了达维斯海。它靠近一块浮冰停下来。为了引导这只不大的并且不适于在冰间驶行的船只，“勒拿号”开出去了。它在第二天带着冷藏船回来，卸运粮食的工作已不能再拖延了。这时，飞机和直升飞机飞向隐现在远处的冰山之间的冷藏船，它们落在靠近船只的岸边坚冰上，把珍贵的食品运往极地驻扎所，这种情况已有好几天了。
    建设工作因卸货中断而开始受到阻碍。索莫夫、科尔特、皮?然尼诺夫、里西岑和我，利用天气好转的机会，乘坐一只小艇沿着冰壁行驶，以便查明船只能否直接驶近冰壁。在另一只小艇上，扎科帕伊罗领导的一批人测量了冰壁的深度和通向它的路径。
    冰壁像风吹起的雪的巨大悬崖一样俯临海面，终于找到了一处不太高的地段，高仅十五到二十公尺，悬崖也不太危险。第二天，索莫夫、高鲁别夫、格列库、古谢夫沿着海岸到了那个地方。我们为了预防崩塌事故，相互用细绳缚着，并用冰锥刺探冰崖，标出安全行程的界限和在雪坑中装置系船索具的地点。二月九日，有经验的破冰船船长维特罗夫勇敢地将“勒拿号”驶向冰障。我们身上缚着绳索攀到悬崖的边缘，按住了从船头上抛来的第一条船索。越来越猛烈的风顽强地驱赶着船只，妨碍系留工作。当阻碍着通路的冰的突出部分被炸掉时，船尾才得以靠紧冰壁。傍晚，系留工作结束了，我们沿着刮暴风时用的舷梯上了船。
    当天夜里就开始卸货。卸货地点一般说来不能算坏，但是不太安全：必须采取一切预防措施，因为船本身是处在悬崖下面。
    “勒拿号”上的海员，科学工作者和建筑师作出了忘我劳动的榜样，在这些复杂的条件下，一昼夜卸货达到八百吨。用卸下船上的货物来迎接苏共第二十次代表大会开幕的决定，鼓舞了所有的人。
    国旗升起来了
    二月十三日是一个纪念日。南极洲海岸上升起了第一个苏联气象台的国旗。
    停泊在冰壁边的船上的桅杆，用各种颜色的旗帜装饰起来。在正在成长的市镇中间，在岩石重叠的广场上，耸立着主席台。传下了口令：“向苏联国旗立正！”。索莫夫升旗。于是，国旗在以庄严的冰山为背景的南极大陆的原野上骄傲地飘扬起来。直升飞机和飞机从主席台上空飞过。索莫夫讲话，谈到“和平”村全体人员完成党和政府的光荣任务的决心。船长、建设者都作了报告。庄严地唱起了苏联国歌。在全体一致同意下向苏共第二十次代表大会发出了贺电。大会以后，大家立即分头工作去了。“和平”村的建筑工程在高速度地继续进行。
