    More than 1,800 young literary authors are now in regular contact with the Chinese Writers Association and its branches, as well as the editorial departments of various literary periodicals. More than 500 of them will participate in the National Youth Literary Creation Conference to be held in March.
    According to recent statistics from the Chinese Writers Association, the editorial departments of literary periodicals across the country receive an average of four or five hundred to a thousand submissions per month, the majority of which are written by young authors. A large number of young literary authors are rapidly growing up from factories, rural areas, schools, military units, and government agencies. Among the 108 members of the Wuhan branch of the Chinese Writers Association, 59 are new forces who have grown up since 1949. Li Zhun, the author of the well-known excellent novel "Can't Take That Road," is a young man who only started practicing writing in 1953.
    Since most of these young authors are direct participants in production, work, and combat, their works have a strong sense of life and can reflect the fresh things in real life from a broad perspective. The autobiographical novel "Gao Yu Bao" by the young soldier-turned-author Gao Yubao, was published last year and has attracted attention from domestic and foreign readers and literary circles. The one-act play "Liu Lianying" by the young author Cui Dezhi, which depicts the image of an advanced worker, is quite successful in its character portrayal. Two of the three authors of the film script "Dong Cunrui," which has achieved good results in creating positive characters, are young authors.
    In recent years, many new forces have also emerged among authors of ethnic minorities. Wei Qilin, a young Zhuang author of the long poem "Hundred Bird Dress," is only 22 years old this year.

    我国青年文学作者正在不断成长
    1，800多个青年文学作者现在正同中国作家协会以及作家协会各分会、各文艺刊物编辑部保持着经常的联系。他们中间的500多人将要参加3月份召开的全国青年文学创作者会议。
    根据中国作家协会最近的统计，各地文艺期刊的编辑部每月平均收到的四、五百件到一千件的来稿中，大部分都是青年作者写作的。大量的青年文学作者正迅速地从工厂、农村、学校、部队、机关里生长起来，中国作家协会武汉分会的108个会员中，1949年以后成长起来的新生力量就有59个。众所周知的优秀小说“不能走那条路”的作者李准，是一个从1953年才开始练习写作的青年。
    由于这些青年作者绝大部分都是生产、工作、战斗的直接参加者，他们的作品有着浓厚的生活气息，并且能从广阔的角度反映实际生活中的新鲜事物。战士出身的青年高玉宝的自传体小说“高玉宝”去年出版后，引起了国内外读者和文艺界的重视。青年作者崔德志写的描写先进工人形象的独幕话剧“刘莲英”，在人物的刻划上有着相当的成功。在创造正面人物方面取得良好成就的电影剧本“董存瑞”的3个作者中，有两个是青年作者。
    在兄弟民族的作者中，近年来也出现了许多新生力量，长诗“百鸟衣”的作者僮族青年韦其麟今年只有22岁。（新华社）
