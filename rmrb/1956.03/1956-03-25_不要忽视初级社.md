    Some rural workers in Taicang County, Jiangsu Province, are neglecting the work of consolidating elementary agricultural producers' cooperatives. They are failing to promptly address policy issues left over from the expansion of elementary cooperatives, intending to resolve them all at once when the cooperatives are upgraded to advanced cooperatives in the future; they are also relaxing leadership over the production of elementary agricultural cooperatives. An inspection of more than fifty cooperatives revealed that the issue of draft cattle joining the cooperatives had not been resolved in more than forty cooperatives, the issue of land valuation had not been resolved in nineteen cooperatives, the division of cultivation areas was improper in more than twenty cooperatives, and the issue of green crops had not been addressed in twenty-three cooperatives.
    After discovering this problem, party organizations at all levels in Taicang County are leading cooperatives in various localities to carry out rectification work centered on production. Each district conducted centralized training for the backbone of more than 450 cooperatives. Many grassroots cadres have also begun to criticize the erroneous idea of ​​neglecting elementary cooperatives. Currently, the rectification work has been widely carried out throughout the county.

    不要忽视初级社
    江苏省太仓县有些农村工作人员轻视巩固初级农业生产合作社的工作：对于初级社扩社中遗留下来的政策问题不去及时处理，企图等待将来转高级社的时候一并解决；对于初级农业合作社的生产也放松了领导。据五十几个社的检查，就发现有四十多个社的耕牛入社问题没有处理，十九个社土地评产问题没有解决，二十多个社耕作区划分的不当，二十三个社的青苗问题没有处理。
    太仓县各级党组织发现这个问题以后，正在领导各地合作社围绕生产进行整社工作。各区对四百五十多个社的骨干进行了集中训练。许多基层干部也已经开始批判轻视初级社的错误思想。现在，整社工作已经在全县广泛开展。
