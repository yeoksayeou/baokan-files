    A Group's Plan and Its Encounter
    By our reporter Fan Rongkang

    The main task of the Second Workshop of Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory this year is to process the parts of the 1K36 lathe, and the quota working hours have been reduced from 678 hours to 472 hours in the past. However, the factory has issued a new target: each worker must complete an average of at least 305 hours of work per month in order for the factory to complete the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule. The actual working hours per month are generally 204 hours, which means that each worker has to complete 305 hours of work in 204 hours each month.

    Before the new target came down, the workers in the lathe group thought: it is still possible to complete 257 hours of work in 204 actual working hours per month. But now that it is required to complete 305 hours of work, they are not sure.

    The group held a meeting to discuss this target and plan to formulate individual and group plans. The secretary of the Party branch, the chairman of the trade union, and the director of the workshop all attended the meeting. No one dared to say that setting a workload of 257 hours per month was not conservative enough; similarly, no one dared to say what the basis was for increasing the monthly workload to 305 hours. The meeting was deadlocked.

    The group leader, Zhang Guobin, and others studied together, believing that it was not enough to simply call for advanced planning; without a solid basis and guarantee measures, the plan would be empty. Everyone agreed that to make advanced plans, they must grasp advanced methods. They recalled which advanced experiences were promoted on those parts last year, how much the efficiency was improved, and which parts could be further applied to; which new advanced experiences could be promoted, and how much efficiency could be improved; and which unreasonable places in the production process could be improved, and how much efficiency could be improved. After thinking and calculating in this way, they had a general idea in their minds.

    The next day, the meeting changed its approach: first find methods and basis, and then propose targets. Everyone helped the lathe operator Zhou Zexiang calculate. According to the workshop's plan, Zhou Zexiang's main task in 1956 was to process the bracket of the hexagonal turret of the 1K36 lathe, with a quota working hour of 55 minutes. Zhou Zexiang said that he could complete it in 35 minutes, based on the fact that he had seen others process this part, and improving a drill could shorten the working hours by 20 minutes. Everyone also helped him study, believing that advanced experiences such as the Soviet Union's powerful internal hole turning tool and powerful external circle turning tool could also be adopted, and it could be completed in 25 minutes. Zhang Guobin had also processed this part, and changing his 4-jaw chuck to a 3-jaw chuck and acting together could save 5 minutes of alignment time. Everyone suggested that Zhou Zexiang also learn from this experience, so it would take only 20 minutes to process this part. Zhou Zexiang considered everyone's opinions and believed that he was confident in completing the processing task of the hexagonal turret bracket in 20 minutes. On this basis, he proposed that he could complete an average of 434 hours of work per month throughout the year, which greatly exceeded the factory's target.

    This method of "one person planning, everyone helping" concentrates the wisdom of the masses and applies various advanced experiences and suggestions for improving production to the specific work of each person, so that the production plan of each person can reach advanced targets. The plans of all 13 people in the lathe group were formulated in this way. In total, the group will promote 9 advanced experiences on 110 kinds of parts, which can increase efficiency by an average of 50%; 7 rationalization proposals have been put forward, and based on the research on the processed parts, it is believed that there are still 26 places that can be improved, and 26 rationalization proposals can be put forward, which is estimated to increase efficiency by 25%. Adding these together, the conclusion is that the group can complete the Five-Year Plan 1 year and 2 months ahead of schedule; it is estimated that the current time quota will be reduced by another 30% when the quota is revised in June, and the Five-Year Plan can also be completed 1 year and 139 hours ahead of schedule.

    In the group plan and individual plans of the lathe group, special emphasis was also placed on being good and economical. In the past, their scrap rate had reached 6%, and they did not pay much attention to reducing raw material consumption. This time, everyone studied the reasons for the high scrap rate in the past and decided that in the future, they should strictly check each process and the first part, check tools, drawings, and process documents, strengthen mutual inspection, and the group should come forward to sign contracts with inspectors to closely connect workers with inspectors, and establish scrap tracing meetings to prevent further scrap. In view of the fact that the technical level of the group members is generally not high, it was decided to establish 4 technical mutual aid groups, and 3 special personnel were appointed to help the 3 youngest, least experienced, and lowest-skilled workers in the group. They formulated these measures to ensure that the scrap rate in the first quarter does not exceed 0.3% and in the fourth quarter does not exceed 0.13%. In terms of saving, in addition to reducing scrap losses, it was also proposed to use Xu Liangui's nesting knife on 3 kinds of parts to save 54 meters of raw materials, to take care of tools, save material costs of 674 yuan, and it was also suggested that the administration solve the problem of large materials for several kinds of parts to save metal.

    The group plan and individual plans of the lathe group are advanced, comprehensive, and practical, and the workers are also working hard to implement the plan. As early as January, before the plan was formulated, they improved production based on the content of the deliberation. The group participated in the factory's team competition, and every worker participated in the competition of the same type of work. The technical mutual aid group is very active, and many parts that cannot reach the quota and cannot guarantee the quality have been reached or even exceeded the quota and guaranteed the quality after research by the technical research group and the help of the workshop technical group. 9 kinds of advanced experiences have been promoted to 70 kinds of parts, 5 rationalization proposals have been realized, and the scrap rate in January was only 0.22%.

    However, the lathe group did not complete the production plan in January, falling behind by 235 hours of work. According to the plan, the production plan for February will also not be completed. What is the reason for this?

    The most important reason is waiting for materials. In January, due to waiting for materials, Zhang Guobin had more than 40 intermittent working hours, and Zhou Yuhui had more than 30 waiting-for-materials working hours. From February 1st to 5th, three machine tools in the group were shut down waiting for materials.

    The workers raised this situation when they were deliberating on the plan. However, the comrades who led the lathe group to formulate the plan at that time did not face these difficulties squarely. They criticized the difficulties raised by the workers in a down-to-earth manner as "ideological obstacles," believing that the workers "erroneously believed that management work could not be improved like in 1955," "did not understand Chairman Mao's instructions enough," and "looked at new things with old eyes," and forced the workers' thoughts to be "unified," admitting that these were "not problems."

    As a result, the objective contradictions that exist in life do not solve themselves just because someone says they are "not a problem." As soon as the plan was formulated, there was a shortage of materials, and the supply of tools could not keep up.

    Of course, it is also wrong to hesitate in the face of difficulties. The correct approach should be to actively improve management work on the one hand; and to guide the masses to give play to their initiative to overcome these difficulties on the other hand. The workers of the lathe group once proposed when deliberating on the plan that the quality of machine tool repairs was not high, and problems often occurred, and they were afraid that the specifications would not be achieved. Later, after debate, everyone realized that the frequent problems with machine tools were not only because the quality of repairs was not high, but also closely related to the poor maintenance in peacetime, and several specific measures were stipulated in the plan. As a result, the workshop improved the quality of machine tool repairs, and the workers maintained them according to their own plans, and the contradiction between the frequent problems with machine tools and the achievement of production targets was resolved.

    From the process of formulating and implementing the plan of the lathe group, two experiences can be drawn: First, the plan should not only be advanced and comprehensive, but also have practical and feasible specific measures, and should also estimate the difficulties that may occur in production and take effective measures to overcome these difficulties. It is wrong to obliterate the actually existing difficulties and build the plan on a hypothetical basis. Second, the task of the leaders is not only to help the masses formulate advanced plans, but also to improve the management work of the enterprise accordingly to ensure that the masses realize the plan. Otherwise, even the best plan will fail.

    一个小组的规划和它的遭遇
    本报记者  范荣康
    沈阳第三机床厂第二车间今年的主要任务是加工1K36车床的部件，定额工时已经由过去的678小时压缩到472小时。但是，厂里又下了新指标：每个工人每个月平均至少完成305小时的工作量，全厂才能提早一年完成五年计划。而每个月的实动工时一般都是204个，这就是说，每个工人每个月要在204小时里完成305小时的工作量。
    新的指标没下来以前，车工一组的工人们想：在每月204个实动工时里完成257个小时的工作量还是可能的。但现在要求完成305小时的工作量，就不敢保证了。
    小组里开会讨论这个指标，酝酿制定个人的和小组的规划。车间的党支部书记、工会主席和车间主任都参加了会。谁也不敢说每月订257小时的工作量就不保守了；同样，谁也不敢说把每月的工作量提高到305小时，究竟有什么根据。会议僵住了。
    组长张国斌等在一块研究，认为仅仅号召订先进的规划是不行的；没有切实的根据和保证措施，订出来也是空的。大家都同意要订先进的规划，就要抓先进的办法。他们回忆了去年在那些部件上推广过那些先进经验，效率提高了多少，还可以扩大应用到那些部件上去；还可以推广那些新的先进经验，效率还可以提高多少；生产过程中还有那些不合理的地方可以改进，效率又可以提高多少。这么一想，一算，心里大体有谱了。
    第二天开会换了个方式：先找方法、找根据，再提指标。大家帮车工周泽相算账。根据车间的计划，周泽相1956年主要加工1K36车床上六角刀台的支架，定额工时是55分钟。周泽相说他可以用35分钟的时间完成，根据是他见过别人加工这种部件，改进一个钻具，可以缩短工时20分钟。大家又帮助他研究，认为还可以采用苏联强力内孔车刀、强力外圆车刀等先进经验，有25分钟也可以完成。张国斌也曾加工过这种部件，把他4个爪的卡盘改为3个爪的卡盘，一齐动作，可以省去5分钟的找正时间。大家建议周泽相也学习这个经验，那么，加工这种部件有20分钟也就行了。周泽相考虑了大家的意见，认为用20分钟的时间来完成六角刀台支架的加工任务是有把握的。在这个基础上，他提出全年平均每月可以完成434小时的工作量，大大超过了厂里的指标。
    这种“一人规划、人人帮助”的办法，集中了群众的智慧，把各种先进经验和改进生产的建议，运用到每一个人的具体工作中去，使每一个人的生产规划都能达到先进的指标。车工一组全组13个人的规划，都是这样制定的。总计全组要在110种部件上推广9种先进经验，平均可以提高效率50％；已经提出7件合理化建议，根据对已经加工的部件的研究，认为还有26处可以改进的地方，还可以提出26件合理化建议，估计可以提高效率25％。把这些加起来，得出的结论是：全组可以提前1年零2个月完成五年计划；估计到6月份修正定额，会把现行的工时定额再压缩30％，还可以提前1年零139个小时完成五年计划。
    在车工一组的小组规划和个人规划里，还特别强调了又好、又省。过去，他们的废品率曾经到过6％，对降低原材料消耗也不大注意。这次，大家研究了过去废品率高的原因，决定今后要严格检查每一道工序和第一个活，检查工具、图纸和工艺文件，加强相互间的检查，由小组出面同检查员订立合同，密切工人同检查员的联系，并且建立废品追根会，防止再出废品。又针对小组成员的技术等级一般都不高的情况，决定成立4个技术互助组，又指定3个专人负责帮助组内3个年纪最小、工龄最短、技术等级最低的工人。他们制定了这些措施，保证第一季度废品率不超过0.3％，第四季度不超过0.13％。在节约方面，除了减少废品损失外，还提出要在3种部件上采用徐连贵套料刀，节省54公尺原料，要爱护工具，节省材料费674元，还建议行政上解决几种部件料大的问题，节约金属。
    车工一组的小组规划和个人规划都是先进的，比较全面，也切实，工人们执行规划也很努力。远在1月里，规划还没有订出来，他们就根据酝酿的内容来改进生产。小组参加了厂里的班组竞赛，每一个工人都参加了同工种竞赛。技术互助组非常活跃，许多达不到定额和不能保证质量的部件，经过技术研究组研究和车间技术组帮助，都已经达到、甚至突破了定额，保证了质量。9种先进经验已经推广到70种部件上，合理化建议已经实现了5件，1月份废品率只0.22％。
    可是，车工一组1月份没有完成生产计划，拉下了235小时的工作量。根据规划来检查，2月份的生产计划也完不成。这是什么原因呢？
    最主要的是待料。1月份，因为待料，张国斌有40多个间断工时，周毓辉有30多个待料工时。2月1日到5日，全组有三台机床停工待料。
    这个情况，工人们在酝酿规划的时候，就提出来了。可是，当时领导车工一组制定规划的同志没有正视这些困难。他们把工人实事求是地提出来的困难当着“思想阻碍”去批判，认为工人们是“错误地认为管理工作还是1955年那样不能改进，”是“对毛主席的指示领会不够”，是“用旧眼光看新事物”，硬把工人的思想“统一”起来，承认这些都“不算问题”。
    结果呢，生活中客观存在的矛盾，并不因为那一个人说它“不算问题”，就自行解决了。规划刚订出来，就待料了，工具供应也来不及了。
    当然，在困难面前踌躇不前，也是错误的。正确的办法应该是一方面积极改进管理工作；一方面引导群众发挥主动精神，来克服这些困难。车工一组的工人们在酝酿规划的时候，曾提出机床检修质量不高，老出毛病，订了规格怕实现不了。后来经过争论，大家认识到机床老出毛病不光是因为检修质量不高，同平时维护保养不好也有密切关系，在规划里就订了几条具体措施。结果，车间里提高了机床检修质量，工人们根据自己的规划维护保养，机床老出毛病同达到生产指标的矛盾就解决了。
    从车工一组制定和履行规划的过程中，可以得出两条经验：第一，规划不仅要先进、全面，也不仅要有切实可行的具体措施，而且还应该估计到生产中可能发生的困难，采取有效措施去克服这些困难。抹煞实际上存在的困难，把规划建筑在假想的基础上是错误的。第二，领导者的任务不仅在于帮助群众制定出先进的规划，而且应当同时相应地改进企业的管理工作，来保证群众实现规划。否则，任凭再好的规划也要落空。
