    A City with a Brand New Look – Nanning
    Jiang Qisheng
    Looking down on Nanning City from above, you can see rows of newly built red-roofed buildings, scattered among the old bungalows or forming entire new streets. The newly paved, wide, and smooth asphalt roads shine brightly. Everywhere here gives a lively and fresh feeling. The current Nanning can be said to be a completely new city. Before liberation, the city area was only 4.52 square kilometers; after liberation, from 1950 to 1954, the urban area expanded to 86.5 square kilometers, and if the newly administered suburbs are included, it reaches 128 square kilometers. The area of buildings in the city was only 270,000 square meters before liberation; now it is 775,873 square meters, with more than 505,000 square meters newly built. The area of newly built asphalt and cement roads after liberation reached 185,150 square meters, with a total length of 11,516 meters. The area has increased 5.7 times compared to the old area, and the length has increased about 7 times.
    The original buildings in Nanning City were basically dilapidated civilian bungalows and small shops, with no public buildings. Now, Nanning's buildings are not only mostly multi-story buildings with modern sanitary facilities, but also serve production and the working people.
    In terms of industry, before liberation, Nanning only had a grain processing factory, a hydropower station, and two small printing factories, all small and rudimentary. After liberation, thirteen newly built and expanded local state-owned factories were established, and the number of workers increased more than five times compared to 1950. In addition, two joint state-private iron factories and a match factory have also seen new development. The number of handicraft households has also increased four to five times. In terms of health and education facilities, four hospitals were expanded after liberation, and four new outpatient clinics and the Provincial Children's Health Station, the Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture Hospital, the Railway Hospital, and the Reclamation Bureau Hospital were built. New institutions of higher learning include the Guangxi Medical College, and secondary schools include Nanning Normal School, the Institute for Nationalities, the Zhuang Normal School, and the Health School, among more than ten schools. The original five secondary schools in Nanning have also been expanded. Taking the Municipal No. 1 Middle School as an example, before liberation, the school area was only 36.5 mu and could accommodate 600 students. After the expansion, the school area reached 173.5 mu, and 23 new classrooms were built, which can accommodate 2,200 students.
    Nanning's new buildings also include a workers' auditorium and a workers' club, as well as cultural and entertainment venues such as theaters and cinemas, which have increased nearly threefold compared to before liberation.
    In the spring of 1951, the working people of Nanning City used voluntary labor to build a People's Park. The location of this People's Park was originally the execution ground where Kuomintang bandits massacred revolutionary soldiers and the barracks of the Kuomintang bandit army. Now, it has become a park for the people of Nanning City. In 1953, on the hillside to the right of the park, on the former execution ground where Kuomintang bandits massacred revolutionary soldiers, the people built a huge library - "Guangxi Provincial Second Library." In 1954, an artificial lake was dug near the library.
    In December 1952, the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region (now renamed Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture) was established. The following year, dozens of new-style high-rise buildings were built on the vast ground of Baicangling in the suburbs of Nanning. The area of these new buildings is 58,700 square meters, which is equivalent to 21% of the total building area of 270,000 square meters in Nanning from the Song Dynasty expansion until the collapse of Kuomintang rule over eight hundred years. Moreover, these buildings are built for the autonomous organs of the Zhuang brothers who have suffered from the oppression of Han chauvinists for thousands of years.
    Nanning can reach Baise and Longjin by water, and Wuzhou and Guangzhou downstream. Since ancient times, it has been a distribution center for materials from the left and right rivers and downstream areas. There are also Yongliu, Yonglong, and Yongse highways connecting to various parts of the province. The transportation is convenient, and the market is active. Now, Nanning is also an important connection point for exchanges between our country (and various fraternal countries on land) and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Since August 2nd last year, every Tuesday and Friday, there have been through passenger cars from Beijing via Nanning to Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    Nanning, this ancient city, is becoming younger, more prosperous, and more beautiful year by year. (Attached picture)

    一个面貌全新的城市——南宁
    蒋齐生
    从高处望南宁市，可以看到一幢幢新盖的红色屋顶的楼房，它们或者散布在旧的平房之间，或者构成整条的新街道。新铺的宽阔平滑的柏油马路闪闪发亮。这里处处给人一种生气勃勃的清新的感觉。现在的南宁，可以说是一个全新的城市。城市面积，在解放前只有4.52平方公里；解放后从1950到1954年，市区扩大到86.5平方公里，如果包括新辖的郊区，则达128平方公里。市内建筑物的面积，解放前只有二十七万平方公尺；现在有775，873平方公尺，新建了505，000多平方公尺。解放后新修的柏油马路和水泥马路面积达185，150平方公尺，共长11，516公尺。比旧有的面积增加五点七倍，长度约增七倍。
    南宁市原有的建筑物基本上是破旧的民用平房、小商铺，没有什么公共的建筑物。现在南宁的建筑物，不仅大部是有现代卫生设备的楼房，而且是为生产、为劳动人民服务的。
    在工业方面，解放前南宁只有一个粮食加工厂、一个水电站和两个小印刷厂，都小而简陋。解放后新建扩建的地方国营工厂达十三个，工人人数比1950年增加五倍多。另外两家公私合营铁工厂和火柴厂也有了新的发展。手工业户也增加了四、五倍。在卫生教育设施方面，解放后扩建了四个医院，新建了四个门诊部和省儿童保健站、僮族自治州医院、铁路医院、垦殖局医院等。新建的高等学校有广西医学院，中等学校有南宁师范学校、民族学院、僮族师范学校、卫生学校等十多校，此外还新建了一些小学校。南宁原有的五个中等学校，也都扩建了。以市立第一中学为例，解放前学校面积只有三十六亩半，可容学生六百人，经过扩建以后，学校面积达到了173亩半，新建教室二十三间，可容学生二千二百人。
    南宁的新建筑物中，还包括工人礼堂和工人俱乐部，以及比解放前增加近三倍数目的戏院、电影院等文化娱乐场所。
    1951年春，南宁市劳动人民用义务劳动修辟了一座人民公园。这个人民公园的所在地，原来是国民党匪徒残杀革命战士的刑场和国民党匪军的兵营。现在，这里却变成了南宁市人民的公园。1953年，在公园的右边山坡下，在原来国民党匪徒们残杀革命战士的刑场上，人民建立起了一座巨大的图书馆——“广西省第二图书馆”。1954年，在图书馆的附近，又挖好了一个人工湖。
    1952年12月，桂西僮族自治区（已经改为桂西僮族自治州）成立了。第二年，在南宁的近郊白苍岭的广大地面上，砌起了数十座新式的高楼。这一带新建筑物的面积共有58，700平方公尺，相当于南宁自宋代扩建直到国民党统治崩溃时止八百多年间全部建筑物面积二十七万平方公尺的21％强。而且这些建筑物是为千百年来受尽大汉族主义者压迫的僮族兄弟的自治机关建筑的。
    南宁，从水路上可通百色、龙津，下达梧州、广州，自古以来，就是左右两江及下河各地物资集散地，又有邕柳、邕龙、邕色各公路可通省内各地，交通便利，市场活跃。现在的南宁又是我国（以及各兄弟国家在陆上）同越南民主共和国交往中一个重要的联结点。从去年八月二日起，每逢星期二、五，都有联运的客车从北京经过南宁开往越南民主共和国首都河内。
    南宁，这个古老的城市，在一年比一年变得年轻、繁荣、美丽。（附图片）
