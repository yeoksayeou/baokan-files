Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 9th. Over 600 newly established joint factories and over 830 public-private joint stores in Chongqing have basically completed the work of inventorying and appraising fixed assets and commodities.

During the asset verification and appraisal work, all industrial and commercial sectors in the city established 40 Public-Private Joint Venture Working Committees, under which many asset verification and appraisal review groups were set up, and a work schedule for asset verification and appraisal was formulated. In terms of working methods, the main approach was to mobilize capitalists to self-inventory, self-fill, self-estimate, and self-report, with the active assistance of the broad masses of workers and staff. Local organizations of various democratic parties and people's organizations also sent cadres to participate in this work. In order to ensure that the asset verification and appraisal work was realistic, fair, and reasonable, the Municipal Bureau of Industry dispatched more than 60 working groups to provide specific assistance to various factories. Many professional companies invited workers and private representatives to hold meetings to solicit their opinions on this work, and listened to their opinions from various aspects. The Municipal Bureau of Industry also selected the relatively well-equipped Zhen Dan Machinery Iron Factory as a pilot project to conduct thorough and meticulous asset verification and appraisal, and then formulated relatively reasonable asset verification and appraisal standards, and organized workers and private personnel from other factories to visit. The Municipal Bureau of Industry and the Bureau of Commerce specifically organized forces to review the asset verification and appraisal work, corrected some phenomena of capitalists underestimating the value and a few including properties belonging to means of livelihood in the inventory project, and urged cadres to handle the asset verification and appraisal issues of small factories where families and factories were indistinguishable with particular caution.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 9th. Public-private joint stores in 46 industries in Shanghai, including department stores, hardware, new medicines, and southern goods, have completed their asset appraisal work. The asset appraisal work for more than 60 other commercial industries has also been fully launched.

The asset appraisal work of these stores was carried out by capitalists who self-reported and self-estimated, and was subject to mutual evaluation among peers. Finally, it had to be submitted to the superior authorities for approval. Before the asset appraisal, the capitalists studied the relevant policies. Many capitalists also drafted detailed work plans. The workers and staff of these stores also enthusiastically assisted the capitalists in carrying out the asset appraisal work.
