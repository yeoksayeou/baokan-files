    Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to Establish a Medical College
    The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is establishing a medical college. The construction project for this institution of higher learning includes teaching buildings, affiliated hospitals, and student dormitory buildings, covering a total area of over 32,000 square meters. In late February, professors from the China Medical University came to Hohhot to help draw up construction design drawings, and the construction start date was advanced to early March, ahead of the original plan.
    The Inner Mongolia Medical College will begin enrollment this autumn. More than 50 professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants from the Beijing Medical College and China Medical University, who are coming to cultivate advanced medical talent in Inner Mongolia, have arrived one after another.

    内蒙古自治区建立一座医学院
    内蒙古自治区正在建立一座医学院。这个高等学校的兴建工程包括教学大楼、附属医院和学生宿舍大楼等，面积共三万二千多平方公尺。二月下旬，中国医科大学的教授们来到呼和浩特，帮助绘制了施工设计图，施工日期比原计划提前在三月上旬开工。
    内蒙古医学院今年秋天开始招生，前来培育内蒙古高等医学人材的北京医学院、中国医科大学的教授、讲师和助教五十多人，已先后到达。
