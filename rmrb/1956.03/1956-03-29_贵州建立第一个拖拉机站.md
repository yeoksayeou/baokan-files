    Guizhou Establishes First Tractor Station
    Guizhou Province's first tractor station, built near Guiyang City, was officially established on March 25. The station has a total cultivated area of more than 8,990 mu, and by 1957, the cultivated area will be expanded to more than 30,000 mu. On March 25, a meeting of representatives of commune members and employees was held at the tractor station, and a production contract was agreed upon by both parties. The employees of the station guaranteed that this year's yields of dry rice, corn, and flue-cured tobacco would increase by more than 80% compared with last year, and the yield of peanuts would increase by more than 90% compared with last year.
