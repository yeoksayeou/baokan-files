　　Protest Against the U.S. Government's Persecution and Detention of Chinese Students Studying in the United States
　　After this newspaper published a letter from Qian Xuesen and 68 other returned students who had studied in the United States, "Accusing the U.S. Government of Persecuting Chinese Students Studying in the United States," and letters from several groups of family members of students studying in the United States, it received many letters from readers. These letters came from all over the country, written by workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and people from all walks of life. They expressed boundless indignation at the U.S. government's shameful acts of seriously violating humanitarianism and not implementing the Sino-U.S. talks agreement, and expressed deep sympathy and condolences to the Chinese students studying in the United States who have not yet been able to return to their motherland and their families; and unanimously supported our government's position in the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks in Geneva, demanding that the U.S. government earnestly implement the agreement on the return of civilians from both sides. Now, excerpts of some of the letters are published below:
　　The entire group of convalescents at the Beijing Public Bus Company Sanatorium wrote to condemn the inhumane behavior of the U.S. government in destroying the happy families of the Chinese people. The letter stated: "Our Chinese students studying in the United States and overseas Chinese in the United States are all diligent, hardworking, and law-abiding people. They are all eager to return to their country to participate in socialist construction and reunite with their families. However, due to the obstruction of the U.S. government, some students have 'lost seven teeth' and have 'gray hair' and still cannot return to their country to reunite with their families; some children are now in elementary school, but have never seen their fathers who are studying in the United States and cannot return... Who is destroying the happiness of these families? This is all caused by the U.S. government. Is this the freedom, democracy, and humanitarianism that the U.S. government has always boasted about?" Pan Yanchang, a reader from Xinxiang, Henan, wrote: "Anyone with a sense of justice, anyone with a bit of human touch, can see that the desire and demand of Chinese students studying in the United States to return to their country is legitimate. The U.S. government is finding all sorts of excuses to persecute Chinese students studying in the United States, which can only show that the U.S. government has always been hostile to the Chinese people."
　　Many readers expressed their views on the U.S. government's deliberate sabotage of the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks. The letter from students of Class 3, Grade 2, Department of Law, Renmin University of China, stated: "Just as the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks reached an agreement on the return of civilians from both sides, and the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks were still ongoing, the U.S. government openly violated international agreements and humanitarian principles, and made things difficult for and persecuted Chinese students who wanted to return to their country. This makes it clear who is creating tensions and who is rudely infringing on basic human rights." Cao Huashan, a reader from Hankou, wrote: "This shameful act of the U.S. government in persecuting Chinese students not only violates humanitarianism, but also seriously undermines the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks that are underway in Geneva. This is a deliberate provocative action by the U.S. government, aimed at creating new tensions."
　　Many readers expressed their indignation at and sternly refuted the U.S. government's shameless lies that our country did not grant Americans in China the right to return home. Zhang Jin, a reader from Hebei, said: "American criminals who have harmed the interests of the Chinese people can be released early by our government even before their sentences are completed. Why are Chinese students in the United States still being subjected to all kinds of persecution?" Kai Ling, a reader from Hexi District, Jishou County, Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Hunan, questioned the U.S. government: "We have released American criminals serving sentences in our country early, why are our innocent Chinese students studying in the United States being persecuted and detained by you?"
　　Gu Deren, who studied in the United States and now works at Tsinghua University, described the experiences of his classmates in the United States, such as Tu Shancheng. He said: "The U.S. government claims that 'no Chinese person cannot freely return to their country.' This is a blatant lie! Behind this lie, thousands of Chinese students studying in the United States, such as Tu Shancheng, are being deprived of their right to return to their country and reunite with their families."
　　The vast number of readers firmly support the actions of family members of students studying in the United States in demanding the return of their loved ones from the U.S. government. Chen Lijun, a public security soldier from Hejiang County, Sichuan, wrote: "The U.S. government is unreasonably detaining our Chinese students studying in the United States. After reading the letters from Zhang Kun's two children, how much we hate the U.S. government's unreasonable actions, and how much we sympathize with those adorable children who have never seen their father! Our country and government protect the happiness of children, women, youth, and the elderly. We ask our government to strongly demand that the U.S. government bring back these loved ones who have been lost for many years." Ba·Duguerjaf, a Mongolian student studying at the Beijing Meteorological School, wrote: "We young people of all ethnic groups firmly oppose this inhumane behavior of the U.S. government. I protest to the U.S. government. The U.S. government must allow Chinese students to return to their country." Li Ji, a reader from Hunan, said: "We lodge a serious protest with the U.S. government. The U.S. authorities should immediately restore the freedom of Chinese students studying in the United States and allow them to return to their motherland as soon as possible. This is the unanimous demand of the Chinese people."

    抗议美国政府迫害和扣留中国留美学生
    本报发表了钱学森等68位留美归国学生“控诉美国政府迫害留美中国学生”一信和几批留美学生家属来信之后，收到了许多读者来信。这些信来自全国各地，写信的人有工人、农民、战士、学生和社会各界人士。他们对美国政府严重违反人道主义精神和不执行中美会谈协议的可耻行径表示无限的愤慨，对还没有能够回到祖国的留美学生和他们的家属寄予深切的同情和慰问；并且一致拥护我国政府在日内瓦中美大使级会谈的立场，要求美国政府切实执行关于双方平民回国问题的协议。现在把一部分来信摘要发表在下面：
    北京市公共汽车公司休养所全体休养员来信，谴责美国政府破坏中国人民幸福家庭的毫无人道的行为。来信说：“我们的留美学生和在美华侨都是勤劳、刻苦和守法的人。他们都急愿回国参加社会主义建设并和家人团聚。但是，由于美国政府的阻挠，有的留学生‘牙齿掉了7个’、‘头发花白’，还不能回国和家人团聚；有的孩子现在已经进小学念书，可是还没有见过在美国留学不能归来的爸爸……。是谁破坏了这些家庭的幸福？这都是美国政府一手造成的。难道这就是美国政府一贯吹嘘的自由、民主和人道主义吗？”河南新乡读者潘延长来信说：“只要有正义感的人，只要有一点人情味的人，都可以看得出，留美中国学生回国的愿望和要求是正当的。美国政府却寻找种种借口对留美中国学生进行迫害，这只能说明美国政府是一贯仇视中国人民的”。
    许多读者对美国政府蓄意破坏中美大使级会谈表示了意见。北京人民大学法律系二年级三班学生的信中说：“正当中美大使级会谈达成了双方平民回国协议而中美大使级会谈还在继续进行的时候，美国政府公然违背国际协议和人道原则，刁难和迫害要求回国的中国学生，这使人明白地看到谁在制造紧张局势，谁在粗暴侵犯人的基本权利。”汉口读者曹华山的来信说：“美国政府这种迫害中国留学生的可耻行径，不仅违反人道主义精神，而且也严重地破坏了正在日内瓦进行的中美大使级会谈。这是美国政府蓄意的挑衅行动，目的是引起新的紧张局势”。
    对于美国政府侮蔑我国没有给予在中国的美国人回国的权利的无耻谎言，许多读者来信都表示愤慨，并且加以严正的驳斥。河北读者张金说：“损害中国人民利益的美国罪犯刑期还没有满都能得到我国政府提前释放，为什么在美国的中国学生还受到种种迫害呢？”湖南苗族自治州吉首县河溪区读者凯灵责问美国政府说：“在我国服刑的美国罪犯，我们都提前释放了，为什么我们无罪的留美学生还遭到你们的迫害和扣留？”
    曾在美国留学、现在清华大学工作的顾德仁的来信，叙述了他现在美国的同学屠善澄等人的遭遇。他说：“美国政府声称‘没有一个中国人不可以自由回国’，这是漫天大谎言！在这谎言后面，却有成千个屠善澄等中国留美学生被剥夺了回国和他们亲人团聚的权利。”
    广大读者坚决支持留美学生家属向美国政府要回亲人的行动。四川合江县公安战士陈理均来信说：“美国政府无理扣留我国留美学生，看了张琨两个孩子的信后，我们是多么地痛恨美国政府这种无理的举动，又是多么地同情那从来就没有见过爸爸的可爱的孩子啊！我们的国家和政府是保护儿童、妇女、青年和老年人的幸福的，我们请求我们的政府，强烈地要求美国政府把这些人们失去多年的亲人要回来。”正在北京气象学校学习的蒙族学生巴·都古尔加甫来信说：“我们各族青年坚决反对美国政府这种毫无人性的行为，我向美国政府提出抗议，美国政府必须让中国学生回国。”湖南读者李吉说：“我们向美国政府提出严重抗议，美国当局应立即恢复中国留美学生的自由，并且让他们早日返回祖国，这是中国人民一致的要求。”
