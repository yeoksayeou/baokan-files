    Speech at the Second Council Meeting (Enlarged) of the Chinese Writers Association (Excerpts)
    Learning from Excellent Classical Writers
    Wu Zuxiang
    I personally haven't been engaged in creative writing for many years. Recently, due to the needs of teaching work, I read some of our ancient Chinese novels. After listening to Comrade Zhou Yang's report, I discussed in the group the issue of learning techniques from our ancient excellent classical works. Comrade Zhou Yang's report mentioned the issue of artistic techniques. He simultaneously put forward three aspects: mastering a correct worldview, delving into life, mastering knowledge, and mastering artistic techniques, that is, putting forward both understanding life and expressing life. This is a comprehensive approach.
    Learning from classic works, both Chinese and foreign, and strengthening our artistic cultivation is important for us. Especially learning from our ancient Chinese writers, which was relatively neglected in the past - among the writers since the May Fourth Movement. At that time, more emphasis was placed on foreign works. Writers made more efforts to learn from foreign works, while relatively neglecting our ancient Chinese works. Absorbing nourishment from foreign literature is, of course, necessary and indispensable. However, some works inevitably carry some foreign flavor. This foreign flavor varies in depth, and the Chinese people cannot get used to it all at once. We often say: Socialist content, national form. However, the general public did not like our works during the May Fourth period. Even now, this situation still exists. Some novels, when read to our ordinary people, they don't dislike them, but they are not very accustomed to them, like someone who rarely goes out borrowing someone else's bedding to sleep in.
    One of the characteristics of ancient Chinese novels, we feel, seems to be a particular emphasis on writing plots and stories. The content of our ancient novels can always be discussed with relish. Because the plot is wonderful and the story is interesting, it is easy to remember, easy to talk about. After discussing the plot and story, the characters' personalities also follow. The ideological theme is also introduced along with it. In this way, not only do readers have a deep impression and like to read, but listeners are also easily attracted and listen attentively. In the past, we had a wrong view that works that focus on plot and story are low-level; only those that emphasize writing about characters are high-level. In fact, our excellent works are not like that. They always use wonderful plots and interesting stories to write characters very profoundly and vividly.
    Is it necessary to learn the techniques of ancient Chinese novels in describing plots and constructing stories? Of course, it is necessary. But I think that learning only from the techniques is not only insufficient, but also impossible. Because techniques serve the theme, and techniques also follow the subject matter taken from life. Leaving the subject matter and theme to learn techniques is like learning the method of roasting Peking duck from Bianyifang or Quanjude to roast vermicelli or cabbage. The result will definitely be a mess.
    "Dream of the Red Chamber," like our other classic realist masterpieces, pays great attention to writing plots. The raid on the Grand View Garden has many refined and novel plot descriptions. One of them is that Tan Chun slapped Wang Shanbao's wife. This slap leaves us with a very deep impression. This passage is full of infectious power, has important significance, and has rich content. I think this plot reveals complex and profound real contradictions in a concentrated and powerful way, and prominently and centrally expresses the personalities of Tan Chun and Wang Shanbao's wife. The description of this plot, the writing of the hit does not take many strokes, the matter itself is simple and ordinary, but here, it seems so moving, so meaningful. Ideological and artistic qualities are both strong, isn't this the most brilliant technique? Where did this technique of writing the plot come from? Obviously, it comes from the author's familiarity with life and the observation, experience, and research of life. Without a rich life, he could not have chosen to summarize and arrange such an engaging and wonderful plot. At the same time, it also comes from the author's understanding and love for life, and a strong love for life. In that slap's description, the author clearly reveals a strong love and hate for the reality of the life he loves and hates. Therefore, that section of the description sharply reveals contradictions, expresses fierce struggles, and has a strong tendency. This is also inseparable from the author's advanced thinking or cognitive ability. Here, you can see that: techniques, life, and cognitive ability, love and hate emotions are closely related, inseparable whole.
    Some people only learn techniques. We often find this phenomenon in the students' exercises in the past in school. They have no life, but they have learned some techniques of famous works, so they only play with techniques, and it becomes showing off small intelligence. It's really hard to watch. The old folks have a saying, "You think you can somersault well, but you don't know you're not even wearing pants." Playing with techniques away from life is like doing somersaults without wearing pants. Thinking you're clever, but actually making a fool of yourself.
    We should learn from ancient writers how to love and pay attention to their lives, how to understand and love their lives, teach us some ways, give us some inspiration, and teach us how to observe, experience, and study life in life. This is to strengthen our artistic cultivation. Artistic cultivation is important and indispensable for us.
    I think that by learning in this way, we can learn some abilities and techniques for describing plots and constructing stories, and we can also learn to master the ability of language and write rich content with very few strokes. For example, playing chess: a chess player without ability, moving a chariot, is only to eat a pawn. The content contained in that move is thin, and the content is poor. If the other party's pawn runs away, it is a wasted move, and that move becomes meaningless. Moving the pieces like this all the time makes the article lengthy and full of nonsense. A chess player with ability, with one move, can defend internally and attack externally; controls the other party's chariot and also threatens the other party's general. One move has multiple meanings and rich content. That situation is different.
    The Party calls for production and construction, wanting more, faster, better, and more economical. Our literary and artistic creation seems to be unable to combine with "economical," but it is not so. "Economical" means that writers save ink and newspapers and periodicals save space. Very little space has very rich content, very high educational significance, and great artistic charm.

    Adding a Flower to the Literary Garden of the Motherland
    Na. Sayinchaoketu
    Just like after the spring breeze and drizzle, the flowers and plants all over the ground sprout and grow leaves, the new literature of the people of Inner Mongolia has been growing under the Party's close care. In recent years, under the cultivation and education of the Party, a group of young writers has emerged in Inner Mongolia. In "Inner Mongolia Literature and Art," not only have the names of many new authors appeared, but also the new works of Mao Yihan, who created "Iron Ox," and many other folk storytelling artists have been published.
    However, our literary creation, compared to the brilliant achievements created by the people of Inner Mongolia as one of the members of the new China, seems too disproportionate.
    Under the shining light of the Party and Chairman Mao's national policies, millions of people in Inner Mongolia, along with its vast and beautiful nature, are full of strong life force. However, have the many new things and new people been expressed in our literary works? How much has been expressed? On this question, we are not without guilt!
    Now, I would like to talk about a few opinions on the issue of using ethnic language literature for creation.
    The literature of all ethnic groups in our country is a literature that combines socialist content and national form. The main factor of national form is language. Therefore, if those comrades who have undergone a certain amount of political training and also have writing talent do not use their own ethnic language to write, it will be very difficult to develop the new literature of their own ethnic group. The language and writing of one's own ethnic group is the most powerful and perfect way to express the life, psychology, and character of the people of that ethnic group. However, in our Inner Mongolia, some comrades who are proficient in both Mongolian and Chinese believe that there are too few readers who write in Mongolian, and they cannot become famous throughout the country. Under the control of this thought, they do not first write in their own ethnic language, but write in Chinese. I hope they can reverse this abnormal phenomenon.
    Writing in the language and writing of other ethnic groups is not something that Mongolian people who do not understand the language and writing of other ethnic groups can feel close to. In addition, the issue of ethnic language literature is also linked to the issue of learning and inheriting the excellent literary traditions of one's own ethnic group; and this largely determines whether a writer's work can be loved by the people. Writing in one's own ethnic language can not only directly encourage the labor and struggle of the people of one's own ethnic group, but also add a unique and colorful flower to the rich and colorful literary garden of the motherland.
    The issue of ethnic writers learning the language and writing of the Han ethnic group on a voluntary basis is also a very important matter. Chinese is a language used by a large population in the world. It not only preserves an ancient and rich cultural tradition, but also spreads new and advanced culture today. It is a tool for cultural exchange between various ethnic groups in the country. Through this language, we can not only read the great works of the Han ethnic group's predecessor writers in the original text, read the works of writers of various ethnic groups; but also be able to access the treasure trove of ancient and modern democratic and progressive literature in the Soviet Union and the world. Especially articles on literary theory and literary criticism, we all have to learn from Chinese. If young writers of various ethnic groups write in their own ethnic language on the one hand, and can also write in Chinese at the same time, that would be the most ideal thing.
    Let's talk about the translation issue. In recent years, the ethnic publishing industry in Inner Mongolia has developed greatly. The Mongolian people can read many works by Han ethnic group writers in their own ethnic language. The Mongolian people are very eager to read the works of Han ethnic group predecessor writers in a timely manner. The current problem is that we must make Mongolian translation work led, organized, planned, and systematic. On the other hand, translating Mongolian works into Chinese as much as possible is also a very important matter. For a writer, it is a glorious and exciting thing for his works to be translated into Chinese and meet tens of thousands of people! Mongolian works can only become the common property of all ethnic groups in the motherland and have the possibility of being widely helped after being translated into Chinese.
    Let us invite Han ethnic group writers to go to our Inner Mongolia to write about the prosperous life of the people of Inner Mongolia! As apprentices in literary and artistic work, we treat you as role models to learn from.

    Struggling Against Vulgar Sociological Tendencies
    Tang Tao
    In recent years, due to work needs, I have also occasionally written some theoretical research articles. Since the publication of the special article on typical problems in the Soviet "Communist" magazine, looking back and examining my own articles, I feel that there is indeed a serious tendency of vulgar sociology, and this tendency is not an isolated phenomenon in the field of literary theory, but a quite common phenomenon.
    There are many reasons for the emergence of vulgar sociology, the main ones being:
    First, not enough study of Marxism, not being able to master this scientific weapon well, not making Marxism the worldview of theoretical workers - that is, the fundamental principle of observing things, but mechanically and dogmatically applying it, which will inevitably simplify and vulgarize Marxism. And the simplified and vulgarized theory has never been a Marxist theory.
    Second, because theoretical workers have been separated from life for a long time, are not familiar with the ever-changing and boiling life, and disregard the specific circumstances at a certain time and under certain conditions, they only use general laws of life to subjectively judge the rich content reflected in artistic works. The separation of theory from the reality of life will also lead to a path of simplification and vulgarization.
    Third, vulgar sociology often uses abstract concepts to give political conclusions to specific works. In addition to the above reasons, it is also because theoretical workers do not understand the characteristics of literature and art, lack artistic cultivation, and are not good at explaining the objective significance of works through artistic analysis, but simply explore the author's subjective intentions. I deeply feel that our theoretical workers (including myself) read too little, read too few Chinese and foreign classical works, and read too few modern works, so the articles written are not only simplified, but also pale and weak.
    We must fight against this tendency. Theoretical workers must make subjective and arduous efforts.
    For this reason, I hope that the literary leadership can give theoretical workers time, just like taking care of creation - time to study, time to read, time to live. Of course, no one has ever said that theoretical workers do not need to experience life, but in fact, very few theoretical workers go to life with creators. Some people think that theoretical workers do not need anything to write articles.
    This concept is also an obstacle to the prosperity of creation.
    Literary theory is a science. Our Party has proposed to march towards science and reach the world's advanced level within twelve years. In Shanghai alone, specialized research institutes such as economics and modern history will be established, but in the field of literature and art, there are not only no specialized research institutions, but also not a single professional literary theory researcher. This phenomenon should be changed. The Party requires us to have experts in Qu Yuan research, experts in Du Fu research, experts in Guan Hanqing research, experts in "Water Margin" research, and experts in "Dream of the Red Chamber" research, requires us to have experts in Shakespeare research, experts in Balzac research, experts in Tolstoy research, experts in Gorky research, and also requires us to have experts in literary history, experts in modern literature, and experts in Soviet literature. However, we have not even carried out the research work on our great flag bearer Lu Xun very well and systematically. Isn't this a serious situation?
    I am not advocating letting experts close the door and do research work. I am saying that there must be professional literary theory researchers, so that they can delve into life and study their profession. Professional literary theory workers can also take one or two apprentices at the same time. They can report their research results to young literary people regularly; they can attend discussions on young literary people's works. There must be more, and major cities must have professional literary theory workers.

### 在中国作家协会第二次理事会会议（扩大）上的发言（摘要）

    在中国作家协会第二次理事会会议（扩大）上的发言（摘要）
    向优秀的古典作家学习
    吴组缃
    我个人已有多年没有从事创作。最近两年因为教学工作的需要，读了一些我国古代的小说，听了周扬同志的报告以后，在小组里谈到向我国古代优秀古典作品学习技巧的问题。周扬同志的报告里谈到艺术技巧的问题，他是把掌握正确的世界观、深入生活、掌握知识和艺术技巧这三方面同时提出来的，就是把认识生活和表现生活同时提出来，这是全面的提法。
    向中外经典作品学习，加强我们的艺术修养，对我们是重要的。尤其向我国古代作家学习，在过去——在五四以来的作家中，是比较的忽略了。那时候，比较偏于看重外国作品，作家们向外国作品学习这方面所做努力比较多些，而对我国古代作品则比较的忽略。从外国文学中吸收营养，当然是必要的，不可少的。但是有些作品却不免带些外国气味，这种外国气味有深有浅，中国人民一时不能习惯。我们常说：社会主义的内容、民族的形式这句话，但我们五四时期的作品，人民大众心里不喜欢。就在现在，这种情形还是存在的。有些小说，要读给我们普通的人听，他们不是不喜欢，但是不十分习惯，就如不大出门的人借了别人的被窝睡觉似的。
    我们觉得中国古代小说的特点之一，好像是特别讲究写情节故事。我们的古代小说的内容总是可以津津有味地谈出来。因为情节精彩，故事有趣，就好记，就好谈、谈出了情节故事，人物的性格也就跟着谈出来。思想主题也跟着介绍了出来。这样，不只读的人，印象深，喜欢读；听的人也容易被吸引，听的聚精会神。过去我们有一种错误的看法，认为注重情节故事的作品是低级的；唯有着重写人物，才是高级的。其实我国的优秀作品并不如此。它们总是通过精彩的情节，有趣的故事，把人物非常深刻、非常生动的写出来。
    学习我国古代小说描写情节、构造故事的技巧，有没有必要呢？当然必要的。但单从技巧上学，我以为不但是不够的，而且也是不行的。因为技巧为主题服务，技巧同时又是跟着从生活中所取的题材来的。离开了题材与主题学技巧，就如学了便宜坊或全聚德挂炉烤鸭的办法来烤粉条、烤白菜。那结果一定一团糟。
    “红楼梦”像我们其他的古典现实主义名作一样，十分讲究写情节，抄检大观园，有许多精新的情节描写。其中之一，是探春打了王善保家的一个耳光。这一打，给我们印象极深，这段描写富有感染力量，有重要的意义，有丰富的内容。我以为这一情节集中地有力地揭示了复杂的深刻的现实矛盾，并且突出地集中地表现了探春的性格和王善保家的性格。这一情节的描写，写打不过几笔，事情本身也简单，也平常，但在这里，就显得这样动人，这样有意义。思想性艺术性两皆高强，难道不是顶高明的技巧吗？这种写情节的技巧那里来的呢？显然是从作者对于生活的熟悉和对于生活的观察、体验和研究而来。没有丰富的生活，他就不可能选择概括与安排出这种引人入胜的精彩的情节。同时也是作者对生活的认识和喜爱，对生活热烈的爱好而来。那一打的描写中，显然流露出作者对于他所爱憎的生活现实的强烈的爱憎。因此，那一段的描写中，尖锐地揭示了矛盾，表现了激烈的斗争，具有强烈的倾向性。这又和作者的先进思想或认识能力是不可分的。在这里就可以看出来：技巧、生活，和认识能力、爱憎感情是密切关联、不可分割的一体。
    有人单学技巧，我们过去在学校的学生的习作中常发现这种现象。他们没有生活，却学到些名作的技巧，于是单耍技巧，就成为耍小聪明，看看真叫人难受。老百姓有这样一句话，“你以为你跟斗翻得好看，你不知你连裤子都没有穿呢。”离了生活耍技巧，就是没穿裤子翻跟斗。自以为聪明，实际是丑态百出。
    我们应该学古代作家怎样的热爱与注意他们的生活，怎样认识与热爱他们的生活，教得我们一些途径，给我们一些启发，教我们怎样在生活中去观察、体验与研究生活。这就是加强我们的艺术修养。艺术修养对于我们是重要的，不可少的。
    我以为这样学，我们就能学到一些描写情节、构造故事的本领和技巧，也可以学会掌握语言的本领，用很少的笔墨写出丰富的内容。比如下象棋：没本领的棋手，走了一着车，只为去吃卒子。那一着的内容蕴藏就单薄，内容就贫乏。如果人家的卒子跑了，就白走了一着，那一着就变得毫无内容。尽是这样的动着子，文章就冗长，而废话甚多。有本领的棋手，动了一着，内可以防御，外可以进攻；管住了人家的车，还威胁了人家的将军。一着中有多方面的意义，有丰富的内容。那情形就不同了。
    党号召生产建设，要又多、又快、又好又省。我们的文艺创作上好像与“省”结合不上，其实不然。“省”就是作家省笔墨，让报刊省篇幅。很少的篇幅有很丰富的内容，很高的教育意义，很大的艺术魅力。
    为祖国文学大花园增加一枝花朵
    纳·赛音朝克图
    就像春风细雨之后，遍地的花草都萌芽生叶那样，内蒙古人民的新文学一直是在党的亲切关怀下成长起来的。近几年来，在党的培养与教育下，我们内蒙古出现了一批青年作家。在“内蒙古文艺”上，不但出现了许多新作者的名字，而且也刊登了创作“铁牤牛”的毛依罕和其它许多民间说唱的艺人们的新作品。
    但是我们的文学创作，跟作为新中国成员之一的内蒙古人民所创造出来的辉煌成就相比起来，就显得太不相称了。
    在党和毛主席的民族政策的光辉照耀下，几百万内蒙古人民连同它的辽阔而又秀美的大自然，都充满了强烈的生命力量。但是，许许多多的新事物、新人物，在我们的文学作品中表现了没有？表现了多少？在这个问题上，我们并不是问心无愧的！
    现在，我想就用民族语言文学进行创作的问题，谈几点意见。
    我国各民族文学是社会主义内容与民族形式相结合的文学。民族形式的主要因素，就是语言。因此那些经过一定政治锻炼、又有写作才能的同志们，如果不用自己民族文字写作的话，发展本民族新文学将是一件很困难的事情。本民族的语言文字，是最能有力地完善地表现本民族人民的生活、心理和性格的。但是在我们内蒙古，有些通晓蒙古文、汉文两种文字的同志们，认为用蒙古文写作读者太少，又不能在全国出名。在这种思想支配下，他们不首先用自己民族文字写作，而用汉文写作。我希望他们能够扭转这种不正常现象。
    用旁的民族的语言文字写作，对那些不懂别的民族语言文字的蒙古族人民来说，是不能感到亲切的。此外，民族语言文学的问题又是跟学习与继承本民族的优良文学传统问题联接在一起的；而这又在很大程度上决定一个作家的作品是否能为人民所喜闻乐见。用本民族语言文字写作，不但能直接鼓舞本民族人民的劳动和斗争，而且也能在祖国的丰富多采的文学大花园里，增加一枝或者更多枝独特的鲜艳花朵。
    民族作家在自愿的基础上，学习汉族语言文字的问题，也是一个很重要的事情。汉语是世界上众多的人口所使用的语言。它不但保存着古老而丰富的文化传统，而且今天，它又传播着新的先进的文化，是国内各兄弟民族文化交流的工具。通过这种语言我们不但可以从原文读到汉族前辈作家们的伟大著作，读到各兄弟民族作家的作品；而且能够接触到苏联和世界上古今民主进步的文学宝库。尤其有关文艺理论和文艺批评的文章，我们都得从汉文上学习。如果各民族青年作家们一方面用自己民族语言写作，同时又能用汉文写作的话，那将是一件最理想的事情。
    再谈翻译问题。近几年来，内蒙古民族出版事业大大发展起来了。蒙古族人民可以通过自己民族的文字，读到许多汉族作家的作品了。蒙古族人民是非常希望及时读到汉族前辈作家们的作品的。目前的问题在于：我们必须把蒙古文翻译工作做到有领导、有组织、有计划，还要有系统。从另一方面来说，尽可能地把蒙古文作品翻译成汉文，也是一件很重要的事情。对一个作家来说，他的作品被译成汉文，能多与几万万人民见面，这是一件多么光荣而令人兴奋的事情啊！蒙古文作品，只有被翻译成汉文之后，才能成为祖国各民族的共同财产，并且有可能广泛地得到帮助。
    我们邀请汉族作家们到我们内蒙古去、写写内蒙古人民欣欣向荣的生活吧！作为文艺工作的学徒，我们是把你们当作榜样来学习的。
    同庸俗社会学倾向作斗争
    唐弢
    近年来由于工作的需要，我也偶而写些理论研究文字。自从苏联“共产党人”杂志关于典型问题的专论发表后，回头检查一下自己的文章，觉得的确严重地存在着庸俗社会学的倾向，而且，这种倾向在文艺理论领域内并不是个别的，而是相当普遍的现象。
    庸俗社会学的产生有许多原因，主要的是：
    第一、对马克思主义学习得不够，还不能够很好地掌握这一科学的武器，没有使马克思主义成为理论工作者的宇宙观——也即观察事物的根本原则，而是机械地、教条主义地应用着它，这就必然会把马克思主义简单化和庸俗化，而简单化了和庸俗化了的理论，从来就是非马克思主义的。
    第二、由于理论工作者长期脱离生活，不熟悉天天在变化着、沸腾着的生活，不顾到一定时间、一定条件下的具体情况，只是根据一般的生活规律，主观地来判断艺术作品所反映的丰富的内容，理论一脱离生活的实际同样会走上简单化庸俗化的道路。
    第三、庸俗社会学常常用抽象的概念给具体的作品下政治性的结论，除了上述的原因以外，也由于理论工作者不了解文艺的特性，缺乏艺术修养，不善于通过艺术分析去阐明作品的客观意义，而是简单地去探索作者的主观意图。我深深地感到：我们的理论工作者（包括我自己在内）读书太少，对中外的古典作品读得太少，对现代作品读得太少，因而所写的文章不仅是简单化的，也是苍白无力的。
    我们必须对这种倾向作斗争。理论工作者更必须作主观的刻苦的努力。
    为此，我希望文艺领导方面能够像照顾创作一样，也给理论工作者以时间——学习的时间，读书的时间，生活的时间。当然，从来没有人说过理论工作者不需要体验生活，但事实上很少有理论工作者同创作家一起到生活里去。有些人认为理论工作者不需要什么就可以写出文章来。
    这种观念同样是繁荣创作的阻力。
    文艺理论是一门科学。我们的党已经提出要向科学进军、在十二年内达到世界的先进水平，单就上海来说，将成立经济、近代史等专门研究所，但在文艺方面，不但没有专门研究机构，连一个专业的文艺理论研究工作者也没有。这种现象是应该予以改变的。党要求我们有屈原研究专家、杜甫研究专家、关汉卿研究专家、“水浒”研究专家、“红楼梦”研究专家，要求我们有莎士比亚研究专家、巴尔札克研究专家、托尔斯泰研究专家、高尔基研究专家、也要求我们有文学史专家、现代文学专家、苏联文学专家，可是，我们连对我们伟大旗手鲁迅的研究工作，也还没有很好地、有系统地进行，难道这不是一个严重的情况吗？
    我并不主张让专家关起门来做研究工作，我是说必须有专业的文艺理论研究工作者，让他们能够深入生活，钻研业务。专业文艺理论工作者可以同时带一两个徒弟，他们可以把研究所得，定期向文学青年作报告；他们可以出席文学青年作品讨论会。必须有更多的、并且使各大城市都有专业文艺理论工作者。
