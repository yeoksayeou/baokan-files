Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 26th: Indonesia's first parliament, established on the basis of universal suffrage, was inaugurated on March 26th. At the opening ceremony of the new parliament held on the morning of this day, President Sukarno announced the formal establishment of the new parliament and the dissolution of the old parliament.

Sukarno said in his address that the inauguration of a parliament elected by the people is an ideal that the people have cherished for decades.

Sukarno said that Indonesia has already experienced two stages in its history. The first stage was the stage of armed struggle to defend the Republic of Indonesia, and the second stage was the stage of struggle for the survival of the Republic. With the formal inauguration of the new parliament, Indonesia has entered a third stage, which is a stage of planned large-scale construction. In this stage, "we must establish our true national spirit and remove from our national spirit all remnants of colonial influence."

Sukarno urged people not to be satisfied with existing achievements and called on people to work harder for greater goals in the future. Sukarno also called on the new parliament to work in a spirit of consultation.

Subsequently, in the presence of the President and Vice President, a ceremony was held in which the outgoing ministers of the Harahap cabinet handed over their credentials to the ministers of the Sastroamidjojo cabinet.
