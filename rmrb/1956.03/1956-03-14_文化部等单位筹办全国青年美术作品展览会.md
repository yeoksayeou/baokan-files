The Ministry of Culture, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the Chinese Artists Association have decided to hold a "National Youth Art Exhibition" in Beijing around National Day this year to encourage and cultivate young artists, to promote art creation, and to expand the art creation team. Recently, they jointly issued a notice soliciting exhibits. The notice stated: The content of the exhibited works should mainly reflect the current socialist construction and people's lives, especially the lives of young people, and praise the new things growing in this era, such as the heroic model figures and deeds emerging in production and class struggle, the upsurge of agricultural cooperation, and the new face of the motherland in all aspects; in addition, beautiful scenery can also be used as creative themes. The scope of the works collected is very wide, including Chinese painting, oil painting, watercolor, printmaking, cartoons, posters, New Year pictures, serial cartoons, illustrations, sketches, quick sketches, and sculptures. Professional or amateur young art workers aged 18 to 35 can apply. The notice also stated: Relevant departments in all provinces (municipalities directly under the Central Government) and autonomous regions should immediately take effective measures to mobilize and organize local professional and amateur young art workers to create works, and be responsible for the collection and preliminary selection of exhibits. Before mid-June, the selected works should be respectively concentrated in Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an, Shenyang, Hohhot, and Beijing for a re-election, and then concentrated in Beijing for a final selection to participate in the exhibition. During the exhibition, awards will also be given, and the authors of outstanding works will receive medals and bonuses awarded by the Ministry of Culture.
