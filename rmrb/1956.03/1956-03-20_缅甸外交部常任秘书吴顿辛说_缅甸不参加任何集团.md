He said that according to the Constitution of the Union of Burma, the Burmese government opposes the establishment of international relations based on war and aggression. Equality and mutual benefit, adherence to international conventions, dedication to peace, and maintaining friendly relations with all countries are the unwavering independent foreign policy of the Government of the Union of Burma.

U Tun Thin said that we believe that different political systems can coexist peacefully, and only peace can bring happiness to mankind. He pointed out that peace requires the implementation of the Five Principles. He said that allowing the existence of blocs is a threat to world peace. Burma does not approve of blocs, and Burma does not participate in any bloc.

U Tun Thin said that the joint statements on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence issued by Burma with China, Vietnam, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and other countries, the Ten Principles of Peace adopted by the Asian-African Conference, and the friendly visits made by Burmese Prime Minister U Nu to various countries have made certain contributions to easing international tensions, especially expanding the zone of peace.

U Tun Thin said that Burma has signed treaties of friendship with India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Ceylon. He said that the Burmese government is also prepared to sign treaties of friendship with some other neighboring countries at an appropriate time.

Speaking of Burma's activities in the United Nations, U Tun Thin said that Burma firmly opposes the colonial system and believes that the existence of the colonial system makes it impossible for mankind to ever have peace.
