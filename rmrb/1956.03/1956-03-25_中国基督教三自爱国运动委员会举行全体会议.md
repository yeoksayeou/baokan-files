Xinhua News Agency, March 24th. The Second Plenary (Enlarged) Meeting of the Chinese Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee was held in Beijing from the 15th to the 23rd.

    Wu Yaozong, Chairman of the Chinese Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee, delivered a report at the meeting on "The Chinese Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement." Wu Yaozong pointed out: Since the National Conference of Chinese Christianity in August 1954, under the encouragement of the spirit of patriotism and love of religion and great unity, the Chinese Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement has achieved extensive and in-depth development throughout the country. He said that the practice of the Three-Self principle by Chinese Christian churches, participation in the socialist construction of the motherland, and the movement to defend world peace are fully in line with Christian beliefs. For the advancement of world peace, Chinese Christians must work together with the people of the whole country to strive for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.
