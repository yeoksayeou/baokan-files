    Tractor Factory Engine and Stamping Workshops Under Construction
    Workers Guarantee Completion of a Large Factory Building in 38 Workdays

    The engine workshop and stamping workshop of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant commenced construction on March 1st and 5th respectively. The start of the engine workshop was more than two months ahead of the original plan, and the stamping workshop was more than half a year ahead of schedule.

    The tractor manufacturing plant currently has six workshops under construction.

    On the construction site of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant, an exciting message is spreading: the workers guarantee to build a large factory building—the engine factory workshop—which normally takes more than half a year to complete, in 38 workdays.

    From the first day of construction until now, the excavation of the foundation pit and the concrete pouring project have exceeded the quota every day. The Second Youth Engineering Team breaks the state quota every day; youth shock brigades such as Wang Yonglou and Lao Yingui exceed the state quota by more than 40%.

    This construction site once used the Soviet advanced integrated lifting method to build a similar-sized workshop in 3 months. The current construction speed was proposed by Soviet experts based on the fact that construction workers have basically mastered a set of rapid construction methods centered on integrated lifting over the past few months.

    拖拉机厂发动机和冲压工场已施工
    工人保证用38个工作日建成一座大型厂房
    第一拖拉机制造厂的发动机工场和冲压工场，分别在3月1日和5日动工兴建。发动机工场的开工比原定计划提前了两个多月，冲压工场提前了半年还多。
    这个拖拉机制造厂目前正在建设的已经有6个工场。
    在第一拖拉机制造厂的建筑工地上，传播着一个令人兴奋的消息：工人们保证用38个工作日，建成一座通常要半年以上才能建成的大型厂房——发动机工厂的厂房。
    从动工的第一天到现在，每天的基坑挖土和混凝土浇灌工程，都超额完成了。第二青年工程队天天都突破国家定额；王永楼、劳银贵等青年突击队超过国家定额40％以上。
    这个工地上曾经运用苏联先进的综合装吊法，在3个月当中建筑了一个大小相仿的工场。目前的这个施工速度，是苏联专家根据建筑工人几个月来已经基本上掌握了以综合装吊为中心的一套快速施工方法的情况提出的。　　　　　　　（据新华社讯）
