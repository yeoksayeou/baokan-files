(Dispatch from our Moscow correspondent on March 25th) The "Pravda" published today a talk by Academician Tupolev, Hero of Socialist Labor of the Soviet Union, about the TU-104 civil aviation jet aircraft, and also published a photograph of this new type of giant aircraft.

Tupolev is a famous Soviet aircraft designer and the inventor of the TU-104 aircraft. He said: The TU-104 aircraft is a fast jet aircraft. It is equipped with two powerful jet engines. The aircraft's cruising speed is 800 kilometers per hour. It participated in last year's Soviet Aviation Day review. All the materials and equipment used in the aircraft are produced in the Soviet Union itself. The aircraft can carry fifty passengers and their luggage. When it flies to an altitude of over 10,000 meters above the clouds, the air pressure inside the cabin is the same as flying at an altitude of 3,000 meters. Each passenger can use oxygen equipment if they feel it necessary. The cabin maintains a temperature of 20 degrees Celsius and constant humidity. Passengers can get hot and cold food during the flight. The aircraft can fly non-stop from Moscow to Novosibirsk (3,000-3,200 kilometers). Using this aircraft on the Moscow-Chita route will only take nine to ten hours. Passengers taking off from Chita at 6 o'clock local time will arrive in Moscow at 8 o'clock Moscow time. In other words, passengers will see the sunrise throughout the entire flight from east to west. The aircraft has swept wings and winglets, which are perfectly streamlined. This ensures high-speed flight.

The aircraft is equipped with the latest radio navigation, radio positioning, and radio communication equipment. There is also equipment for blind landings at airports and automatic navigation during flight. All of this ensures that the aircraft can complete flights in any weather conditions and can carry out regular long-distance flights at any time of the year and day or night. The aircraft can also fly with one jet engine working, and the flying altitude is above 5,000 meters. The Soviet aviation industry is now continuously producing TU-104 aircraft.

    苏联的TY—104式民航喷气飞机
    本报莫斯科25日专电　“真理报”今天发表了苏联社会主义劳动英雄图波列夫院士关于TY—104式民航喷气飞机的谈话，并且登载了这个新式巨型飞机的照片。
    图波列夫是苏联著名的飞机设计师，也是TY—104式飞机的发明人。他说：TY—104式飞机是快速喷气飞机。它装备有两部强大的喷气发动机。飞机的航行速度一小时八百公里。它参加过去年苏联航空节的检阅。飞机用的材料和设备全部都是苏联自己生产的。飞机能载五十名乘客和他们的行李。它飞到超过云层的一万公尺高空时候，舱内空气压力就像飞在三千公尺空中一样。每个乘客如果感到有必要可以使用氧气设备。舱内保持摄氏二十度温度和不变的湿度。飞机航行时候，乘客可以得到热食和冷食。飞机可以不着陆从莫斯科飞到新西伯利亚（3，000—3，200公里）。用这种飞机在莫斯科—伯力航线之间航行，只需九—十小时。乘客按照当地时间六点从伯力起飞，到莫斯科时间八点已经抵达莫斯科。换句话说，从东方飞到西方的整个航行中，乘客都见到日出。飞机有箭形的机翼和支翼，是完善的流线型的。这保证高速飞行。
    在飞机上装置着最新的用无线电指导航行的、无线电定位的和无线电通讯的设备。还有为盲目降落飞机场用的和在飞行中自动领航用的设备。这一切保证飞机能在任何气象条件下完成飞行，能在年度的任何时间和昼夜的任何时间实行经常的远程航行。在用一个喷气发动机工作时，飞机也能飞行，并且飞行的高度在五千公尺以上。现在苏联航空工业连续生产着TY—104式飞机。
