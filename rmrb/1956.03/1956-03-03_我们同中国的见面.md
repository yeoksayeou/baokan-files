Our Meeting with China
Member of the Yugoslav Journalist Delegation to China
Editor-in-Chief of "Borba", Vitorević

On December 27th last year, when the deep green twin-engine plane we were on landed at Beijing Airport from Irkutsk, it was the first meeting with China for us, the members of the Yugoslav Journalist Delegation. None of us had ever been to this great and beautiful country before.

The warm handshakes and enthusiastic greetings of "你好 (Nǐ hǎo - Hello)" from our hospitable Chinese hosts and comrades could not help but fill us with excitement. We were excited because we were setting foot for the first time on the land of a country whose internal development has had a tremendous impact on the modern world.

When we were about to embark on this long journey, when we met acquaintances on the streets of Belgrade or elsewhere (who already knew from the newspapers that a Yugoslav journalist delegation would visit China), the first thing they said was: "You are so lucky to have the opportunity to see China and understand the Chinese people."

These words not only fully expressed our feelings at the time but also expressed our long-cherished desire. Because we are not only journalists but also Communist Party members who have been severely tested by the War of Liberation. Our country has also achieved revolution through its own internal strength, creating the conditions for establishing a socialist society and socialist social relations.

Therefore, in the strict and true sense, our meeting with China at Beijing Airport was not the first meeting. We have known this huge country for many years. In fact, our understanding of Chinese culture, art, and literature—which is necessary for understanding a country's people—is insufficient and superficial. However, our understanding of the history of the Chinese people is not, especially the modern history, the history of the Chinese people's heroic revolutionary struggle.

I still clearly remember that more than 20 years ago, despite being thousands of miles apart, we watched with excitement the glorious footsteps of your 25,000-li Long March. Later, we learned how your People's Army crossed the wide Yangtze River and how your army broke through the enemy's heavy blockade and encirclement with superior equipment. Sometimes we knew the details; such as how your soldiers crossed impassable snow-capped mountains and the dangerous Lazikou Pass with superhuman perseverance (only in the years after this did our People's Liberation Army also follow the same path).

And we knew at that time that you would win this just struggle. When you inflicted a complete defeat on the defeated enemy in the final battles of the War of Liberation, we felt happy from the bottom of our hearts. We, the Yugoslav journalists, reported these news extensively. In that year, 1949, we published a huge book, a translation of Comrade Mao Zedong's most important works.

It can be seen that the meeting at Beijing Airport that afternoon was certainly not our real first meeting with China. It has long been said that in the relationship between nations, in mutual understanding, knowledge, and cooperation, geographical distance does not play an important role. Today, when the world is linked by many transportation networks, the significance of geographical distance is diminishing. Cooperation and growing closeness between peoples are an objective trend, one of the greatest characteristics of our current era. The duty of all progressive and peace-loving people is to accelerate the process of this objective trend, that is: cooperation, mutual understanding, and closer proximity between nations, because this is the best way to serve the peace we desire.

This is especially important for our two countries, which have many similarities in history and development paths and have many points of contact. Both China and Yugoslavia achieved independence through revolutionary struggle. Both countries have made great efforts to free themselves from centuries of backwardness. Today, they are both building socialism, although using different methods and forms suitable for their own specific historical conditions.

We Yugoslav journalists came to China with a frank and humble attitude. We want to see this country, which is far away but also very close to us. Understand its problems, efforts, and achievements, understand its forms and paths of development, so as to report to our readers and people who are very interested in China today. I believe your readers are equally interested in what is happening in Yugoslavia.

I should say that our Chinese colleagues and comrades have given us great help in this regard. The All-China Journalists Association excellently organized our visit to China, helping us to see a lot and understand all aspects of your country's cultural, economic, and social life in just 50 days. We traveled to many cities, from Harbin in the north to Guangzhou in the south. We visited many factories, mines, and agricultural producers' cooperatives. We met many people—from workers and peasants to the highest leaders. We were warmly received everywhere and felt the warmest sympathy for the Yugoslav people.

We will take away from China an extremely strong impression of your country's development, your construction achievements, the ardent desire of your working people to build a new life in the world, and the great labor enthusiasm of your people. I will never forget Feng Shen, a 20-year-old female worker who works at the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory. Although she is young, she uses her skillful, light, and ingenious hands to produce extremely precise and complex 0.25 mm drill bits. When I saw her working on the lathe, concentrating intently on the microscope, Feng Shen, at the age of 20, embodied the image of China today in its construction, displaying youth, upsurge, ingenuity, and tenacity.

Of course, the deepest impression on all members of the Yugoslav Journalist Delegation was the meeting with Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China. This was the greatest moment during our visit to China. We are convinced that our visit to your country, and the recent visit of Chinese journalists to Yugoslavia, will make a great contribution not only to a better and closer mutual understanding and exchange of socialist experiences between our two countries and peoples but also to strengthening the comprehensive cooperation between the two countries. This cooperation is beneficial to peace and socialism.

### 我们同中国的见面

    我们同中国的见面
    南斯拉夫新闻工作者访华代表团团员
    “战斗报”总编辑  维托罗维奇
    去年12月27日，当我们乘坐的深绿色的双引擎飞机从伊尔库茨克飞抵北京机场上着陆的时候，对于我们——南斯拉夫新闻工作者代表团团员们来说，这是第一次同中国见面。我们中的任何一个人，在这以前从来没有到过这个伟大而又美丽的国家。
    好客的中国主人和同志们对我们亲切的握手和热诚的问候“你好”，使我们不能不答以激动的心情，我们之所以激动，是因为我们第一次踏上了这样一个国家的土地，这个国家的内部发展在当代产生了巨大的影响。
    在即将动身来作这次远途旅行的时候，当我们在贝尔格莱德的街上或任何其他地方碰到熟人时（他们从报纸上已经知道南斯拉夫新闻工作者代表团将访问中国），他们头一句话就是：“你们真幸福，有机会看到中国，了解中国人民。”
    这些话语不仅是充分表达了我们当时的感觉，并且也表达了我们向往已久的愿望。因为我们不仅是新闻工作者，而且也是同样经过解放战争严峻考验的共产党员。我们的国家同样用自己内部的力量实现了革命，创造了建立社会主义社会和社会主义社会关系的条件。
    因此，按照严格的和真正的意义来说，我们在北京机场上同中国的见面，并不是第一次见面。我们在许多年以前就知道这个巨大的国家。实在说，我们对中国的文化、艺术和文学——这是了解一国人民所必须的——的了解是不够的和肤浅的，但是，我们对中国人民历史的了解却不是如此，尤其是近代的历史，中国人民英勇革命斗争的历史。
    我仍然清楚地记得，远在20余年以前，尽管相离万里，我们就曾以激动的心情注视你们二万五千里长征的光荣足迹。以后，我们又知道你们的人民军队是如何渡过了宽阔的长江，你们的军队是如何冲破在装备上占优势的敌人的重重封锁，围击。有时我们知道的还很详细；如你们的战士以超人的毅力越过了不能通过的雪山和天险腊子口（仅仅在这几年之后，我们的人民解放军队也走过了同样的道路）。
    而且我们当时也知道你们将要赢得这个正义的斗争。当你们在解放战争最后的一些战役中给已被击溃的敌人以彻底打击的时候，我们曾经从心底里感到高兴。我们南斯拉夫的新闻工作者们曾经连篇累牍地报道过这些消息。在上述事件发生的那一年，即1949年，我们出版了一本巨大的著作，即毛泽东同志最重要的作品的翻译本。
    由此可见，那天下午在北京机场上的见面，诚然不是我们同中国的真正的第一次见面。很早以前就有人说过，在各国人民相互之间的关系上，在相互认识、了解和合作上，地理上的距离并不能起重要的作用。在今天，当全世界被许多交通线路网联结在一起的时候，地理距离的意义是越来越小了。各国人民之间的合作和日益接近是一种客观趋势，这是我们生活所在的当今时代中最大特点之一。一切进步的和热爱和平的人们的职责就在于加速促进这个客观趋势的过程，这就是：各国人民间的合作，相互了解，更密切地接近，因为这样才能最好地为我们所渴望的和平服务。
    对于我们两个在历史上和在发展道路上有着许多相同之处，并有许多接触点的国家来说，这点特别重要。中国和南斯拉夫都是通过革命斗争取得独立的。两个国家都以巨大的努力把自己从几世纪的落后中摆脱出来。他们今天都正建设着社会主义，虽然用着不同的，但适合于本国具体历史条件的方法和形式。
    我们南斯拉夫的新闻工作者们是抱着坦率、虚心的态度来到中国的。我们要看看这个相距遥远，而同时对我们很亲近的国家。了解它的问题、努力和成就，了解它的发展的形式和道路，以便向对今天中国抱极大兴趣的我国读者和人民作报道。我相信你们的读者同样也对南斯拉夫正在发生的事情感到兴趣。
    我应当说，我们中国的同行和同志在这方面给了我们很大帮助。中国新闻工作者联谊会卓越地组织了我们在中国的访问，帮助我们在短短的50天中看了很多东西，了解了你们国家的文化、经济、社会生活的各方面。我们走了许多城市，从北方的哈尔滨到南方的广州。我们访问了许多厂矿和农业生产合作社。我们和许多人见了面——从工人、农民到最高领导人。在各地我们都受到了十分热诚的招待，感受了对南斯拉夫人民最热烈的同情。
    我们从中国将带走对你们国家的发展、你们建设的成就、你们劳动人民在世界上建立新生活的热望和你们人民的伟大的劳动热情的极强烈的印象。我永远不能忘记一个20岁的女工冯申，她在哈尔滨量具刃具厂工作。虽然她年青，但以灵巧，轻快，天才的双手生产出极精密复杂0.25公厘的钻头。当我看到她在车床上，聚精汇神地注视着显微镜而工作的时候，20岁的冯申在我的眼中体现了今天的中国在建设中所表现出的青春、高涨、天才和刚毅的形象。
    当然，给南斯拉夫新闻工作者代表团全体团员印象最深的是中华人民共和国主席毛泽东同志的接见。这是我们在中国访问期间最伟大的一个时刻。我们深信，我们访问你们的国家，和不久前中国记者访问了南斯拉夫，不仅对于我们两国和人民更好的和更接近的相互了解以及交流社会主义经验方面，而且在加强两国全面合作的事业方面将会作出巨大的贡献。这种合作是对和平和社会主义有利的。
