Jiangsu Province Exceeds Quota in Allocation of Improved Seed Varieties

The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry has already exceeded its quota for the allocation of improved seed varieties by 71%. The province allocated a total of 107.06 million jin of improved seeds, which has prepared conditions for the reform of cultivation systems on 25 million mu of land across the province this year. The allocation of japonica rice seeds alone can meet the needs of grain variety reform work such as "converting indica rice to japonica rice" and "converting early rice to late rice" on more than 9 million mu.

    江苏省调拨良种计划超额完成
    江苏省农林厅调拨良种计划已超额71％完成了。全省调拨的良种共10，706万斤，这些良种，为今年全省2，500万亩土地面积的改革耕作制度工作准备了条件。单调拨的粳稻种一项就可以解决900万亩以上“籼稻改粳稻”、“早稻改晚稻”的粮食品种改革工作的需要。	（本报驻南京记者）
