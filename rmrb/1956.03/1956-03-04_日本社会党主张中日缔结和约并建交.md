    日本社会党主张中日缔结和约并建交
    新华社3日讯　东京消息：日本社会党国际局和外交政策委员会3月1日举行联席会议，讨论承认中华人民共和国的问题。
    据共同社报道，会议就有关问题的基本方针大致取得一致的意见。会议认为，关于日中关系，日本要同中华人民共和国政府结束战争状态，恢复正式邦交，并且为此缔结和约。
    会议同时决定执行这样的方针：台湾应当归属于中国的合法政府，不承认台湾的独立。会议还提出了实现这个方针以前的暂时措施。在这些暂时措施中，提到了要使在台湾的美军撤退。
    会议还一致认为，应当恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的代表权，取消蒋介石集团在联合国中的代表权。
    此外，会议又决定这样一项方针：在恢复日本同中国的邦交以前，应该解决缔结贸易协定、设立通商代表团、两国侨民自由往来等问题。
