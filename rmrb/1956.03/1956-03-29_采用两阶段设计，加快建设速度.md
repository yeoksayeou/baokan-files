    Adopt a Two-Stage Design to Accelerate Construction Speed
    Li Zhi
    Design is a crucial task in capital construction. Accelerating the design speed will also accelerate the entire capital construction speed. In the past, our design work was generally divided into three stages (preliminary design, technical design, and construction drawings). The task of the preliminary design is to correctly select the factory site, understand the basis for the various main indicators of enterprise construction (investment, equipment, personnel, area, and various power consumption, etc.), and determine the technical possibility and economic rationality of enterprise construction. The task of the technical design is to conduct detailed technical calculations and discussions based on the preliminary design, and to propose detailed financial budgets, material and equipment lists, in order to carry out various preparatory work for capital construction (material preparation, appropriation of funds, arrangement of construction sites, etc.). Construction drawings are the detailed technical basis for civil engineering and installation engineering.
    In order to accelerate the speed of capital construction, some units have changed the three-stage design to a two-stage design, that is, merging part of the technical design work in the three-stage design into the preliminary design stage, and incorporating the other part into the construction drawing stage. The elimination of the technical design stage saves the same part of the work that was repeated in the preliminary design and technical design in the past. Judging only from the drawing of design drawings and the preparation of explanatory documents, the preliminary design in the two-stage design saves more than half of the workload compared to the preliminary design and technical design in the three-stage design. In the past, a lot of preparatory work for capital construction could only be carried out after the technical design was completed. If the technical design was slow, the preparation work for construction would also be delayed. After adopting the two-stage design, preparatory work can be carried out as long as there is a preliminary design, which creates conditions for accelerating the entire construction progress.
    A factory of the Second Ministry of Machine Building, which was not very large in scale, adopted a three-stage design, and the design work took a total of three years, not counting the time for selecting the factory site and collecting data; while another factory, which was larger in scale and more technically complex, used only half a year for the design work due to the adoption of a two-stage design. For the design of general machine factories, the two-stage design can shorten the time by at least half a year to one year compared to the three-stage design.
    However, there are still many designers who are unwilling to adopt the two-stage design. They believe that the more detailed and specific the design is, the better, and shortening the design stage can easily make the design rough and produce errors. It should be admitted that the adoption of a two-stage design does have difficulties for some technically complex industrial enterprises that have never been designed before. But for general industrial enterprises whose production processes are not very complicated, or that have already designed similar types of industrial enterprises, the difficulties can be overcome. When doing the preliminary design, especially the design of the process part, the designer can try to consider it as carefully and meticulously as possible, and supplementary technical designs can also be prepared separately for individual complex projects.
    In recent years, our designers have accumulated a lot of experience, and their technical level has also improved. There are also some typical new industrial enterprises for reference, and the use of standard design drawings and repeatedly used drawings and data is increasing. Therefore, the conditions for adopting a two-stage design in the construction of general industrial enterprises are already in place. In order to accelerate the speed of industrial construction in our country, the two-stage design should be adopted as much as possible for all industrial enterprises that can adopt it.

    采用两阶段设计，加快建设速度
    立之
    设计是基本建设中带有关键性的一项工作，加快设计速度也就可以加快整个基本建设的速度。过去，我们的设计工作一般都分为三个阶段（初步设计、技术设计和施工详图）。初步设计的任务是正确地选择厂址，了解企业建设的各种主要指标（投资、设备、人员、面积和各种动力消耗等）的根据，确定企业建设在技术上的可能性和经济上的合理性。技术设计的任务是根据初步设计作详细的技术上的计算和探讨，提出详细的财务预算、材料和设备清单，以便进行基本建设的各项准备工作（备料、拨款、布置施工现场等）。施工详图是土木工程和安装工程的详细技术依据。
    为了加快基本建设速度，有的单位把三阶段设计改为两阶段设计，即把三阶段设计中的技术设计的部分工作合并到初步设计阶段中去，把另一部分并入施工详图阶段中去做。取消了技术设计阶段，就省去过去在初步设计和技术设计中重复的相同部分的工作。仅就绘制设计图纸和编写说明文件来看，两阶段设计中的初步设计就比三阶段设计的初步设计和技术设计省去一半以上的工作量。过去很多基本建设的准备工作要在技术设计完成以后才能进行，技术设计进行得慢了，建设的准备工作也就迟迟不能进行。采用两阶段设计后，只要有了初步设计，就可以进行准备工作，这就给加速整个建设进度创造了条件。
    第二机械工业部有一个规模并不太大的工厂，是采用三阶段设计的，选择厂址和搜集资料的时间不算，设计工作共花了三年；而另一个规模较大、技术也复杂得多的工厂，由于采用两阶段设计，设计工作只用半年时间。一般机器工厂的设计，采用两阶段设计比采用三阶段设计的时间，至少可以缩短半年到一年。
    但是，现在仍有不少设计人员不愿采用两阶段设计。他们认为设计做得愈细致、具体愈好，缩短设计阶段就容易使设计粗糙并产生错误。应该承认，采用两阶段设计，对某些技术比较复杂的从来没设计过的工业企业来说，的确有困难。但是对一般生产过程并不十分复杂，或者已经设计过同样类型的工业企业来说，困难是可以克服的。在做初步设计，特别是工艺部分的设计的时候，设计者可以尽量考虑得周到细致些，对个别复杂的单个工程，也可以单独编制补充的技术设计。
    几年来，我国设计人员已经积累了不少经验，技术水平也有所提高，并且有了某些典型性的新工业企业可供借鉴，采用标准设计图纸和重复采用的图纸资料愈来愈多，因此，在一般工业企业建设中采用两阶段设计的条件已经具备了。为了加快我国工业建设速度，对一切可以采用两阶段设计的工业企业，应该尽量采用。
