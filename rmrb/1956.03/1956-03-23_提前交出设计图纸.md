Liaoning region design departments have successively proposed to complete the 1956 design tasks two to six months ahead of schedule.

The Shenyang Coal Mine Design Institute's task this year increased by 45% compared to last year. After mobilizing the masses to summarize 103 advanced experiences, and promoting simplification, standardization, and modularization, they handed over 95% of the construction drawings required for the second and third quarters in late February. It is expected that this year's tasks can be completed within six months.

The Third Design Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, after inspecting and criticizing conservative thinking, increased this year's first quarter's nineteen design tasks to forty. At the Anshan Iron and Steel Metallurgical Design Institute, projects using standard designs will account for 25% of the workload this year, and the construction drawings for the whole year can be basically issued in the first half of the year.

    提前交出设计图纸
    辽宁地区各设计部门纷纷提出要提前两个月到六个月完成1956年的设计任务。
    沈阳煤矿设计院今年的任务比去年增加45％，经过发动群众总结了一百零三条先进经验，推行了简化、标准化和规格化等工作，今年二、三季度需要的施工图纸，二月底就交出了95％，预计可在半年内完成今年任务。
    第一机械工业部第三设计分局，在检查和批判了保守思想以后，把今年第一季度的十九项设计任务增加到四十项。鞍山黑色冶金设计院今年采用标准设计的项目，将占工作量的25％，全年的施工图纸上半年就可以基本上发完。（本报驻沈阳记者）
