How Agricultural Production Cooperatives Should Manage Animal Husbandry
By our reporter Lin Mo

Whether farmers and herders are willing to take the path of collectivization in animal husbandry depends, most fundamentally, on whether agricultural production cooperatives can improve animal husbandry production, increase the income of members, and demonstrate the superiority of collective management. Based on the situation in the semi-agricultural, semi-pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia, agricultural production cooperatives need to do seven things well to improve animal husbandry production:

(1) Implement rotational grazing and improve grazing techniques. In the past, under decentralized management, semi-agricultural, semi-pastoral areas generally practiced fixed settlements and fixed grazing, and livestock could not regularly eat good grass. After the cooperatives implement unified management, they can increase grazing equipment and rationally divide and use pastures; in most areas with more pastures, rotational grazing can be implemented. Some agricultural cooperatives have divided pastures into four seasons, with wells dug in each pasture, and implement seasonal rotation, so that livestock can eat good grass all year round. Some classify livestock and graze them in small groups, and continuously study and improve grazing techniques for various livestock. Some have also organized special technical research groups to summarize and promote advanced experience.

(2) Select and retain high-quality, sufficient numbers of breeding stock, and do a good job in livestock mating. At present, in many places, the phenomenon of unmatched female animals is very serious due to the small number and poor quality of breeding stock. Cooperatives are fully capable of overcoming this difficulty. Where conditions permit, improved breeds of livestock can also be purchased to improve livestock breeds.

(3) Fully stock up on fodder. In areas with grasslands, mowing machines should be used as much as possible. In areas lacking grasslands, crop straws should be used to make silage feed, and pasture should be gradually planted in a planned way to establish a feed base.

(4) Build livestock sheds and pens, and keep the pens dry and warm.

(5) Do a good job in lambing and protecting young animals.

(6) Establish women's milking groups to unify milking, and continuously improve technology to increase milk production.

(7) Prevent and control livestock diseases. Agricultural and pastoral cooperatives should select young people with a certain level of education and train their own animal husbandry veterinarians as early as possible.

Agricultural and pastoral cooperatives should establish animal husbandry production teams according to production needs. Cooperatives with a large number of livestock should have a cooperative director directly manage animal husbandry. The quality of livestock raising depends on the quality of grazing work. Therefore, grazing should be entrusted to people with good skills and a certain degree of political awareness, and they should be specialized as much as possible. Some cooperatives have regarded grazing as light labor and let semi-laborers or elderly people do it; some have changed grazers several times in a season, which has caused losses to production.

Agricultural production cooperatives must also organize and uniformly allocate labor well according to the different seasons of agricultural and pastoral production. Some cooperatives initially lacked experience in this regard, and during the busy farming season, they would pull people from the animal husbandry side, and when animal husbandry was tight, they would pull people from the agricultural side, which resulted in disrupting both agricultural and pastoral production. Generally speaking, people involved in grazing and milking in animal husbandry cannot be easily transferred to help agriculture during the production season. Only the women in the milking group can spare some people to help with threshing after the milking work ends in the autumn. However, four tasks in animal husbandry, namely spring pasture preparation, lambing and livestock protection, grass cutting, and winter camp equipment, require the mobilization of people from agriculture to help. In particular, the grass cutting season in animal husbandry coincides with the weeding and ridging in agriculture; and the preparation of winter camp equipment coincides with the autumn harvest and threshing in agriculture. Some cooperatives often experience chaos at this time due to insufficient advance planning.

The leaders and general members of agricultural production cooperatives must have a correct understanding of agricultural and pastoral production. Some agricultural production cooperatives have neglected one aspect while emphasizing the other, so that the production potential of animal husbandry or agriculture cannot be realized. Initially, there was often mutual dissatisfaction between agricultural production team members and animal husbandry production team members regarding the lightness or heaviness of labor due to their lack of understanding of each other's production situation. People in the agricultural production team said: "Those who graze livestock wander around all day and are so relaxed, yet they get such high work points!" People in the animal husbandry production team said: "Plowing the land is like walking with a crutch, so comfortable!" Therefore, all members must be educated to realize that both agricultural and pastoral production require skills and involve hard work.

In animal husbandry production, it is also necessary to gradually create a set of scientific work evaluation and point recording methods to ensure that people participating in animal husbandry production can receive reasonable compensation and give play to their labor enthusiasm. Some cooperatives have already stipulated work quotas for milking, shearing, grass cutting, building sheds, raising young lambs, and tending to old and weak livestock, and have implemented piece-rate payment. For example: milking, 0.7 points per dairy cow per day (including the production of milk products); shearing, 0.5 points per sheep; catching goat cashmere, 0.2 points per two (calculated by quantity); raising calves and goat kids, 0.15 points per head per day; raising lambs, 0.1 points per head per day. (Note: Raising young animals is generally done by women, who can still handle household chores while raising twenty or thirty calves or lambs per person.) After implementing piece-rate payment, labor efficiency can generally be increased by 30% to 40% compared to simply recording time and awarding points in the past.

In grazing, work points are generally assessed based on different seasons and the lightness or heaviness of labor. For example, during the lambing, "cattle running mad" (mating season), and "between green and yellow" (transition from green grass to withered grass) periods, grazing is more laborious, generally 10 points per day. Under normal circumstances, 7 to 8 points per day. Winter grazing, 8 to 9 points per day. Night watch, grazing on snowy, rainy, and windy days, the work points should be higher. At the same time, grazing different livestock such as scattered animals, female animals, goats, and sheep, the work points are also different. This ensures that grazers receive relatively reasonable compensation; however, there are no specific requirements for the quality of livestock raising, and it cannot further stimulate the creativity of the members. A more ideal way of grazing is contracting for work and output, with fixed quality and quantity. For example: for grazing female animals, it can be stipulated that: how many heads are grazed, and under normal circumstances, what standards should the conception rate and reproduction rate reach, and how many labor days can be obtained. For grazing general scattered animals, in addition to calculating by the number of heads, the quality can specify the degree of fatness of the livestock, or the amount of weight gain per head. In this way, the enthusiasm of the members can be brought into play and the improvement of all aspects of feeding management can be promoted. Of course, it is impossible to do this well all at once, and it must be gradually improved in the process of doing it.

    农牧业生产合作社怎样经营畜牧业
    本报记者　林沫
    农牧民愿意不愿意在牧业上走合作化的道路，最中心的问题是农牧业生产合作社能不能把牧业生产搞好，使社员增加收入，显示集体经营的优越性。根据内蒙古半农半牧区的情况，农牧生产合作社要搞好牧业生产，需要作好七件事：
    （一）实行移场放牧，改进放牧技术。过去分散经营的时候，半农半牧区一般都是定居定牧，牲畜不能经常吃到好草。合作社统一经营后，就可以增加放牧设备，合理划分和使用牧场；在大部分牧场较多的地区，都可以实行移场放牧。有的农牧业合作社划分了四季牧场，每处牧场都打了水井，实行四季轮放，牲畜一年四季都可以吃到好草。有的把牲畜分类、分小群放，不断研究改进各种牲畜的放牧技术。有的还专门组织了技术研究小组，总结和推广先进经验。
    （二）选留质量好、数量充足的种畜，作好牲畜交配工作。目前很多地方因为种畜数量少、质量差，母畜失配的现象很严重。这种困难，合作社完全有力量克服。有条件的地方，还可以购买良种牲畜，改良牲畜品种。
    （三）充分储备草料。在有草场的地方，应该尽量使用马拉割草机割草。草场缺乏的地方，需要利用农作物的秸草，作青贮饲料，并且逐渐有计划地种植牧草，建立饲料基地。
    （四）搭盖牲畜棚圈，圈内要保持干燥、暖和。
    （五）做好接羔和保护幼畜的工作。
    （六）建立妇女挤奶组，统一挤奶，并且不断改进技术，提高奶的产量。
    （七）防治牲畜疫病。农牧社应该选择具有一定文化程度的青年，及早地培养自己的畜牧兽医人员。
    农牧业合作社应该根据生产需要，建立牧业生产队。牲畜多的社，应该有一个社主任直接管理牧业。牲畜饲养得好坏，决定于放牧工作做得好坏。因此，放牧要选择技术好、政治上有一定觉悟的人，并且尽量使他们专业化。有的社曾把放牧当成轻劳动，让半劳力或老年人去干；有的一季调换几次放牧人，都使生产受了损失。
    农牧业生产合作社还要根据农业牧业生产的不同季节，很好地组织和统一调配劳力。有些社最初在这方面缺乏经验，农忙的时候就拉牧业方面的人，牧业吃紧了就拉农业方面的人，结果把农业牧业生产都搞乱了。一般地说，在牧业上参加放牧和挤奶的人，在生产季节是不能随便调动去帮助农业的。只有挤奶组的妇女，在秋季结束挤奶工作以后，能抽出一部分人去帮助打场。但是牧业上的春季移场准备工作、接羔保畜、割草、冬营地的设备等四种工作，都需要调动农业上的人帮助。特别是牧业上的割草季节，同农业上的锄地、放垅挤在一起；准备冬营地的设备又正是农业上的秋收打场时期。有些社因预先计划不周，往往在这时候发生紊乱现象。
    农牧业生产合作社的领导人员和一般社员对农业牧业生产要有正确的认识。有的农牧业生产合作社，由于只重视一方面而忽视了另一方面，使牧业或农业的生产潜力得不到发挥。在农业生产队员和牧业生产队员之间，最初由于彼此对生产情况不了解，往往在劳动的轻重上互不服气。农业生产队的人说：“放牲畜的一天游游荡荡多松快，还得那么高的工分！”牧业生产队的人说：“犁地像扶着拐杖走路一样，多舒展！”因此，要教育全体社员认识到：农业牧业生产都要有技术，都要进行艰苦的劳动。
    在牧业生产上，还必须逐步创造出一套科学的评工记分办法，保证参加牧业生产的人能得到合理的报酬，发挥劳动积极性。有的社对挤奶、剪毛、割草、搭棚盖圈、饲养幼羔和老弱牲畜等活计，已经规定了工作定额，实行了按件计酬制。如：挤奶，一头乳牛每天0.7分（包括制成奶食品）；剪毛，一只绵羊0.5分；抓山羊绒，每两（按数量计算）0.2分；饲养牛犊、山羊羔，一只每天0.15分；饲养绵羊羔，一只每天0.1分。（按：饲养幼畜，一般都是妇女作，每人饲养二、三十只牛犊或羊羔，仍能照常处理家务。）实行按件计酬制以后，比过去单纯记时评分，劳动效率一般可提高30％到40％。
    在放牧方面，目前一般是根据不同季节和劳动轻重评定工分。如在接羔、牛跑疯子（交配期）、青黄不接（青草、枯草交替时期）时期，放牧比较费力，一般是每天10分。通常情况下，每天7分到8分。冬季放牧，每天8分到9分。夜间打更，下雪下雨和刮大风天放牧，工分要高一些。同一个时间，放散畜、母畜、山羊、绵羊等各种不同的牲畜，工分也各有差别。这样作，能够保证放牧人得到比较合理的报酬；但是，对牲畜饲养的好坏，缺乏具体要求，不能进一步激发社员的创造性。在放牧上比较理想的办法是包工包产、定质定量。譬如：放牧母畜，可以定出：放牧多少头，在正常情况下，保证受胎率、繁殖率达到什么标准，可得多少劳动日。放牧一般散畜，除按头数计算外，在质量上可以定出牲畜达到几成膘，或每头牲畜增加体重多少。这样，就可以发挥社员的积极性，促进饲养管理各方面的改进。当然，实行这种办法，也不可能一下子就搞得很好，要在做的中间逐步改进。
