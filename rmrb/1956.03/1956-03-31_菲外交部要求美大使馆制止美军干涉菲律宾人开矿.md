Xinhua News Agency, March 29th, Manila dispatch: The Philippine Foreign Ministry, on March 27th, requested the U.S. Embassy in the Philippines to stop the U.S. military authorities stationed in central Luzon from interfering with the mining activities of Filipinos near Clark Air Base in Tarlac Province.

The Philippine Foreign Ministry took this action based on a complaint from Santa Maria, a Filipino mining operator. On March 17th, the U.S. military confiscated a truckload of manganese ore from this person and detained him and his nine miners for two hours. The Philippine Foreign Ministry has requested the U.S. military authorities to return Santa Maria's confiscated ore and to formulate a permanent arrangement so that the U.S. military authorities no longer obstruct Filipino miners from transporting ore out of the mining area.

This incident has aroused public anger in the Philippines. Many members of Congress have demanded a review of the U.S.-Philippine military base agreement. On the 27th, Santa Maria and his partners again protested to the Foreign Ministry, demanding a prompt resolution to the incident. They said that this matter affects the welfare of thousands of miners and their families.

    菲外交部要求美大使馆制止美军干涉菲律宾人开矿
    新华社29日讯　马尼拉消息：菲律宾外交部在三月二十七日要求美国驻菲律宾大使馆制止驻在吕宋岛中部的美军当局干涉菲律宾人在丹辘省克拉克机场附近的采矿活动。
    菲律宾外交部是根据一名菲律宾采矿业经营者桑塔马里亚的申诉而采取这个行动的。美国军队曾经在三月十七日没收了这个人的一卡车锰矿砂，并且还把这个人和他的九名矿工扣留了两小时。菲律宾外交部要求美国军事当局归还被没收了的桑塔马里亚的矿砂，并且要求拟定一种永久性的安排，以便美国军事当局不再阻挠菲律宾矿工把矿砂运出采矿区。
    这个事件已经激起菲律宾公众的愤怒。许多国会议员要求重新审查美菲之间的军事基地协定。二十七日，桑塔马里亚和他的合伙人再次向外交部提出抗议，要求迅速解决这个事件。他们说，这件事影响到数以千计的矿工和家属的福利。
