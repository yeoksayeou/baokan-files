    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 5th. The joint declaration signed recently in Paris between France and Morocco regarding French recognition of Moroccan independence has provoked a widespread reaction among residents of Spanish Morocco. "Zhendan Bao" reports that on March 4th, thousands of people participated in a demonstration in Tetuan, Spanish Morocco. They shouted slogans such as "Long Live Independence!" and "Down with Colonialism!" Spanish police used tear gas and weapons in an attempt to disperse the demonstrators. 40 demonstrators were injured and 50 were arrested.
    The newspaper wrote that the situation in Tetuan is "exceptionally tense." Spanish troops have surrounded the city. The Franco authorities have banned a demonstration that Moroccan residents had planned to hold on March 5th.
    The Franco-Moroccan joint statement has caused unease among the Franco Spanish ruling group. A government cabinet meeting was held in Madrid on March 3rd, and the meeting decided to issue a note to France. Although the content of the note has not yet been published, Agence France-Presse points out that it is expected that the note will "express certain opinions regarding the new situation in Morocco."

    西属摩洛哥人民举行示威反对殖民主义要求独立
    新华社据塔斯社巴黎5日讯  最近在巴黎签订的法国和摩洛哥关于法国承认摩洛哥独立的联合声明引起西班牙属摩洛哥居民的广泛反应。“震旦报”报道，西属摩洛哥的得土安3月4日举行了由几千人参加的示威游行。他们高呼口号：“独立万岁！”、“打倒殖民主义！”西班牙警察使用了催泪弹和武器，企图驱散示威游行的人。示威者有40人受伤，50人被捕。
    报纸写道，得土安“局面异常紧张”。西班牙军队包围了这个城市。弗朗哥当局禁止摩洛哥居民原定在3月5日举行的示威游行。
    法国—摩洛哥联合声明引起弗朗哥西班牙统治集团的不安。3月3日在马德里举行了政府内阁会议，会议决定向法国提出照会。照会的内容虽然还没有发表，但是据法新社指出，预料，照会将对“摩洛哥的新情况表示某些意见。”
