Comrades! The Twentieth Congress of our great Party, founded and steeled in battle by the immortal Lenin, will be written into the heroic annals of the Soviet state as a most prominent event, marking a new stage in the creative development of Marxism-Leninism and a further powerful upsurge in the socialist economy.

In the summary report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Comrade N.S. Khrushchev defined the magnificent program of our Party's work, profoundly analyzed the issues of Soviet international and domestic life, and creatively developed, in accordance with the current era, the Marxist-Leninist principles on the peaceful coexistence of two systems, on the possibility of preventing war, and on the forms and paths of transition to socialism in different countries.

In the past five years, the Communist Party, headed by its Leninist Central Committee, has achieved tremendous successes in all fields of economic and cultural construction, consolidated the power of the Soviet state, and enhanced its international prestige.

In the report on the directives of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, Comrade N.A. Bulganin described the plan for the further development of the national economy on the basis of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, mastering new technologies, and widely applying advanced techniques.

The vast scale of the Soviet people's creative labor in the Sixth Five-Year Plan would be impossible if our Party had not guaranteed the completion of the Fifth Five-Year Plan with all its previous activities.

The summary that the Party brings to its Twentieth Congress is the result of the heroic labor of workers, peasants, and intellectuals under the wise guidance of the Party, which leads our country along the Leninist path. (Applause)

All the activities of the Communist Party since the Nineteenth Congress have unfolded under the sign of consolidating the inseparable connection with the masses and are imbued with a deep belief in the people and their boundless creative power.

For our Party, close contact with the working people is the law of building a new society, because communism is the result of the conscious creation of the masses.

The great Lenin repeatedly emphasized that "only those who believe in the people, who immerse themselves in the living springs of the people's creation, can win and seize power." (Lenin's Collected Works, Vol. 26, p. 259)

Relying on transmission belts such as the Soviets, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League, the Party inspires workers, peasants, and intellectuals to create labor feats. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet trade unions united the masses to fight for the victorious completion of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, attracted them to participate in political, economic, and cultural construction, and strove to overcome shortcomings and satisfy the growing material and cultural needs of the workers.

In his report to the Twentieth Party Congress, Comrade N.S. Khrushchev profoundly analyzed the growing role of Soviet trade unions, while also giving severe and correct criticism of the serious shortcomings that hinder the trade unions from victoriously solving the tasks put forward by the Party in the current stage of communist construction.

The All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions and the central committees of various trade unions encountered some unfavorable phenomena in the life of various enterprises and in the work of various departments and governing bodies, but the criticism of these shortcomings was timid and did not sharply raise vital issues to the economic organs. All this lowered the level of work and the role of the trade unions as militant organizers of the masses.

At every stage of the construction of a new society, trade unions are faithful transmitters of the Party's policies. There is no doubt that the trade unions will eliminate the shortcomings in their work and will spare no effort in the future to gloriously shoulder their glorious role as a Leninist school of communism. (Applause)

		Striving for Dynamic Leadership of Socialist Competition

Comrades, the grand and unprecedented scale of creative work in the Sixth Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy is astounding.

The main task of this plan is to ensure the further improvement of all industrial sectors, agriculture, the material welfare and cultural level of the people, on the basis of prioritizing the development of the production of means of production, constantly improving technology, and increasing labor productivity. The completion of the Sixth Five-Year Plan will lead our country to a higher stage of economic development.

In 1960, the production of pig iron, steel, and rolled steel in our country will increase sharply, the mining of coal and oil will increase significantly, the output of machine tools and machines will increase, the production of electricity, chemicals, and consumer goods will rise, crop yields will increase, and animal husbandry will experience an unprecedented upsurge.

The Sixth Five-Year Plan is a five-year plan for vigorous technological progress, electrification, and the peaceful use of atomic energy.

Our Communist Party has no other interests than the interests of the people. The Leninist party, which unites millions of people around itself, devotes all its boiling energy and all its wisdom to striving for the victorious realization of communism. The working class, the entire Soviet people, believe from their own experience that socialist labor is a source of building a new and happy life.

Lenin wrote: "People who for centuries have toiled for others, slaved or drudged for exploiters, have for the first time gained the possibility of working for themselves, and of employing all the latest achievements of technology and culture in their work." (Lenin's Collected Works, Vol. 26, p. 368)

The real results of labor productivity are embodied in the growth of industrial and agricultural output, in the state's increasing allocations for education, healthcare, and social security, in the unprecedented scale of construction of housing and cultural facilities, and in the continuous improvement of the cultural level and material welfare of the working people.

The Soviet trade unions consider their main and most important task to be: to educate the broad masses to adopt a communist attitude towards labor, and to guide their creative initiative to maximize labor productivity - the decisive condition for the victory of communism.

As convincingly demonstrated in Comrade N.A. Bulganin's report, the figures for the growth of labor productivity stipulated in the Sixth Five-Year Plan, namely, at least 50% in industry, at least 52% in construction, and approximately 34% in railway transportation, are urgently needed and are entirely achievable.

The draft directives of the Twentieth Congress on the Sixth Five-Year Plan define specific paths for accomplishing these tasks.

The inexhaustible creativity shown by the masses in the nationwide socialist competition is a powerful source for ensuring not only the completion but also the over-fulfillment of the Sixth Five-Year Plan's important task of sharply increasing labor productivity. The characteristic of the current stage of competition lies in the fact that, in addition to mastering advanced technologies, participants in the competition also reform outdated technological procedures, improve production, utilize existing potential, and on this basis, ensure increased output, improved quality, and reduced production costs with the least amount of working time. This has been particularly strongly confirmed in the socialist competition launched nationwide to welcome the Twentieth Party Congress, in which the workers of hundreds and thousands of enterprises, machine tractor stations, and state farms have achieved outstanding production achievements.

The workers of the Moscow Vladimir Ilyich Electrical Equipment Factory completed the 1955 production plan by December 1st. In the years of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, this factory more than doubled its output and reduced production costs by 42%.

A competition was launched between production teams and sections of the "Central-Pokrov Mine" in Voroshilovgrad Oblast. The sixth section, which adopted the cyclic chart system, won the competition to welcome the Twentieth Party Congress in this mine. In December of last year, the coal mining plan for this section was completed by 125%, and in January 1956, it was completed by 142%. In January alone, the miners in this section overfulfilled the plan by 3,500 tons of coal.

The ranks of production innovators and advanced figures are expanding daily, and they are becoming a huge driving force in the competition. To become an innovator, one must be proficient in one's own business, be good at using and mastering new technologies, and utilize advanced scientific achievements. Advanced figures in socialist production exert their abilities and talents in the competition, impart their experience to others, and drive the laggards forward.

Many innovators among the metallurgical workers can be cited as examples. The rapid steelmaking workers Pomedon, Sarosh, and Dyakonov from the Zaporozhstal Steel Plant used oxygen blowing, which increased steel production by 20% and extended the continuous operation time of large-capacity furnaces to 540 heats, while the average for the entire workshop was only about 470 heats. Steelmakers Kozlov, Kalmykov, and Strukov from the Zlatoust Metallurgical Plant extended the continuous operation time of small-capacity open-hearth furnaces to 895 heats, while the same open-hearth furnaces in other factories could only produce 400 to 450 heats of steel. The number of innovators in many enterprises in Leningrad has multiplied several times in the last six months alone. The innovators in the "Electrical Equipment Factory" have made great contributions to further improving production. According to Comrade Fedotov, a foreman, a procedure was implemented in the factory to convert die-forging work into joint operations. A new combined press for pressing electrode plates replaced the original two presses, which could increase labor productivity by 50% to 60%.

The most laborious process in the factory is milling the slots of turbine generator rotors. This process takes 500 man-hours. Miller Kosh used a circular milling cutter with hard alloy blades. This increased the labor productivity of the slot milling process by four times.

The initiative of innovators has a great impact on the completion and over-fulfillment of production plans in enterprises, workshops, and sections. However, the value and significance of the innovation movement increases as the experiences of innovators gradually become the wealth of the broad masses. It is precisely because of this that the trade unions consider one of their most important tasks to be, in addition to increasing the number of innovators, to enable all workers to master advanced working methods and increase their initiative in socialist competition.

In solving this task, trade union activists must play a leading role. Trade union activists lead the masses by setting an example, promoting advanced working methods, and raising laggards to the level of advanced workers.

For example, Comrade Sevastyanov, the trade union group leader of a section of the Novocherkassk Electric Locomotive Factory, completed 14 years' worth of quotas during the Fifth Five-Year Plan and imparted his experience to other workers, resulting in the labor productivity of this section increasing by more than two times.

The trade union group leader and forger Grigory Malyshev of the forging workshop of the Gorky Automobile Factory gets along very well with the workers in his workshop. After he promoted the experience of advanced forgers in his section, the amount of technologically qualified quotas completed by each worker exceeded 120%, while he himself regularly completed 150% to 160% of the quota.

In the spinning production of the Ivanovo Mixed Textile Combine, the experience of trade union group leader Karkova was widely promoted. She works on two spinning machines and completes 125% to 130% of the quota per shift. There are many such examples, however, the trade unions have not been able to make every trade union activist a leader in socialist competition in their own production section.

Trade union activists, especially the 1.3 million trade union group leaders, should influence the masses by setting an example, raising the level of socialist competition, and promoting the experience of production innovators.

Socialist competition between factories, between districts, between workshops, between repair shops, and between individual workers should be the object of careful organization and study by trade unions and economic organs.

Regrettably, many trade union organizations and economic organs rarely study the experience of innovators and do not strive to implement organizational and technical measures that can guarantee the creation of conditions for highly productive labor.

Many trade union organizations in enterprises still rarely discover the potential of production. For example, the drilling team of Comrade Kimadzhov, a famous technician and fast worker of the "Tatar Oil" United Enterprise, drilled 17,671 meters in a year, and most teams completed their annual plan, averaging 9,830 meters drilled, but at the same time, more than 40 teams failed to complete their production tasks, averaging only 5,500 meters drilled per year.

If the Ministry of Petroleum Industry and the Central Committee of the Trade Union were concerned about bringing all the teams up to the level of the teams that completed the plan, then the "Tatar Oil" United Enterprise alone could drill more than 187,000 meters, or enable about 80 new oil wells to produce oil.

In many enterprises, schools for learning advanced working methods have been greatly developed, and these schools are one of the effective forms for actively adopting and widely promoting the experience of production innovators. This is not the ordinary school with teachers who teach students. In these schools, the innovators themselves act as teachers, and they demonstrate at the workplace how operations should be carried out and how good work results should be achieved.

In 1955, the Leningrad Hardware Factory trained more than 400 people, and the Kuznetsk Metallurgical Combine trained more than 1,000 people in schools for advanced working methods. In the first half of 1955, more than 1.6 million workers were trained in such schools in various enterprises.

The trade unions must take all measures to ensure that this tested form of widely mastering advanced working methods and improving the skills of workers is further developed in the Sixth Five-Year Plan.

Various forms of individual and collective competition have begun to unfold between enterprises, and publicity work on the working methods of production innovators has been carried out. Various posters and pamphlets have been published, and mutual visits and exchanges between production groups of enterprises with similar characteristics have been organized. Production innovators introduce their work at production meetings. Competition between factories and workshops promotes the exchange of experience.

In the process of inter-factory competition, the Ural Machine Factory learned from the Ural Vehicle Factory's experience in increasing the strength of electric furnace roofs and using automated and semi-automated welding methods; while the Ural Vehicle Factory also learned from the Ural Machine Factory the technological procedures for manufacturing cast tools and the use of hot corundum tools.

It is necessary to encourage teams from various enterprises to visit each other by various means. This form of mass work, if well organized, can achieve good results.

When implementing the Sixth Five-Year Plan, inventors and rationalization proposers who tirelessly study and improve production, develop technology, and improve advanced technological procedures can play a significant role. In the four years of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, more than 6 million rationalization proposals were put forward in enterprises, of which 3.5 million have been applied to production.

The acceleration of the speed of technological progress largely depends on the creative initiative and enthusiasm of inventors and rationalization proposers. Trade union organizations should be more concerned about inventors and rationalization proposers, help them in their work, and resolutely fight for the application of adopted proposals and inventions in production. It is necessary to absorb engineers and technicians to lead the movement of rationalization proposals and inventions. Engineers and technicians should show greater initiative and give practical help to the movement in carrying out rationalization proposals and inventions on a large scale.

The Scientific and Technical Association, which unites about 400,000 Soviet experts and production innovators, should stand at the forefront of the struggle for technological progress. Last year, the Scientific and Technical Association held more than 20,000 scientific and technical congresses and conferences, 380 competitions, and took other mass measures. The results of these meetings and activities proved the enormous potential for further developing production that the enthusiasm and creativity of the engineering and technical community can unearth.

Management agencies have a responsibility to ensure the adoption of organizational and technical measures in order to put the proposals of rationalization proposers and inventors and the things recommended by the Scientific and Technical Association into production as soon as possible.

Production meetings that help to expose and overcome shortcomings in labor organization help to successfully complete production plans including various technical and economic indicators. It should be frankly said that many economic leaders do not consult with workers on how to improve production, and this causes a lot of loss. They forget to talk directly with the workers, who can come up with many valuable ideas for improving the regular economic leadership of enterprises and for eliminating bureaucratic obstacles that hinder the improvement of socialist production based on their rich wisdom.

Many enterprises hold production meetings on time, and they bring many benefits to improving work. At the production meeting of the Kalinin Machinery Factory in Podolsk, many suggestions were adopted, and as a result of implementing these suggestions, about 500 units of equipment were freed up, more than 11,000 square meters of production space were freed up, labor productivity was increased, product quality was improved, and product costs were reduced.

In the No. 3 open-hearth furnace workshop of the Petrov Metallurgical Factory, as a result of implementing the suggestions passed at the production meeting, the metallurgical technological procedures were improved, and steel production increased by 128 tons per month.

Although the work of production meetings is undeniably effective, many Party, economic, and trade union organizations still underestimate its significance, rarely convene meetings, and do not strive to implement the adopted suggestions, thus suppressing the production enthusiasm of workers.

The duty of Party cadres in the trade unions is to lead the growing enthusiasm of workers, engineering technicians, and staff members and guide their efforts to complete the Sixth Five-Year Plan for the further development of the national economy.

The Party has put forward to the trade unions a task of great national significance - to conduct daily leadership of the socialist competition. However, the implementation of this task still lags behind the requirements of life. Competition is a manifestation of the creative enthusiasm of the masses, which is full of a high degree of discipline of social labor. It does not tolerate any conservatism. Specifically leading the competition of enterprises, workshops, and production teams and organizing the masses to improve labor productivity are the main forms of work that determine the success of the cause.

The new technologies used in enterprises require workers to have specialized knowledge and be good at using them, and at the same time, they will accelerate the improvement of the cultural and technical level of cadres. Due to the influence of technological development, the members of the working class are also changing, and more and more workers and staff members are receiving seven-year, secondary, and higher education.

By the end of 1955, among the workers and engineering technicians under the age of 25 with seven-year, secondary, and higher education, the Ural Machine Factory accounted for 64%, the Kuznetsk United Steel Plant accounted for 55%, the Ivanovo Great Textile Factory accounted for 58%, and the "Koksivaya" Mine in Kuzbass accounted for 32%.

All of this makes it the responsibility of the trade unions to lead the competition more skillfully, to exert creative enthusiasm, to resolutely adopt advanced production experience, to ensure a wider publication of the results of the competition, and to correctly use the forms of material and spiritual rewards to encourage advanced producers - winners in the individual, production team, inter-factory, and all-Soviet socialist competition.

It is necessary to ensure a fundamental improvement in the reward system for advanced workers in the competition, to improve the system of awarding all-Soviet socialist competition with banners, certificates of honor, and bonuses to outstanding enterprises, workshops, and production teams, so as to give at least 75% of the bonuses to workers who create material wealth.

All organizational and educational work of the trade unions should be subject to mobilizing the masses of workers to victoriously complete the tasks of the Sixth Five-Year Plan.
		Strengthen the Attention of Various Trade Unions to
		Labor Quotas and Wage Quotas

Comrades! The Party and the government are constantly very concerned about the issue of labor quotas and wage quotas. Wages are a powerful lever for increasing labor productivity and improving the material welfare of workers. Trade unions and management agencies should ensure the implementation of the Leninist principle that staff members are materially concerned about the results of their labor. In the post-war years, the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions and the central committees of various trade unions did not seriously study the issues of labor and wages, and Comrade N.S. Khrushchev was completely correct in pointing this out in his report.

Various departments have implemented many labor wage systems to solve certain production tasks and eliminate weak links. However, after the goal has been achieved, the reward system has not been revised, but rather mechanically implemented. Like other departments, the wage rates in the coal industry have not changed, but the types of wage supplements have increased: excess bonuses, bonuses for mining coking coal, bonuses for completing cyclic work systems, and other types of subsidies. For example, Comrade Kolonin, the assistant to the combined machine operator of the No. 107-108 Coal Mine of the "Karaganda Coal Mining" United Enterprise, received a salary of 6,355 rubles in October 1955. In this salary, in addition to the direct wages of 2,172 rubles paid according to piecework, the excess bonus calculated from 80% of the completion quota was 1,653 rubles, the bonus for over-fulfilling the plan for mining coking coal was 1,406 rubles, the bonus for over-fulfilling the cyclic work system was 1,068 rubles, and other subsidies were 56 rubles. Thus, the proportion of wage rates in the total salary accounted for only 25%.

What are these subsidies? In essence, they are various kinds of bonuses, and the purpose is to achieve the same indicator - to complete the plan. In the coal industry, the proportion of workers' wage rates accounts for 57%, but in many cases, it only accounts for 25%.

This example illustrates that the attitude of economic agencies towards setting wage systems is incorrect.

In the enterprises of the wood processing industry, the ratio of labor productivity growth and wage increase is abnormal. In the past five years, labor productivity has increased by 26%, while the average wage of workers has increased by 30%. This is because the forestry industry has not made good use of the abundant machinery it has obtained, and also because labor is not organized satisfactorily.

In many enterprises, the achievements of technology are still not taken into consideration when determining production quotas. The leaders of enterprises do not pay attention to the formulation of technically based quotas. It is not production quotas that determine wages, but quotas adapt to the existing wage levels. Experience-statistical quotas still override advanced technical quotas.

There are also serious shortcomings in the work of setting wages for engineering technicians and staff members. The state standards for the wages of staff members implemented by the Ministry of Finance are unattended to. Staff members in the same position receive various accidentally determined salaries. The salaries of foremen, process technicians, and section chiefs are often lower than those of the workers they lead.

The All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions and the central committees of various trade unions have not shown the necessary initiative to correct shortcomings and raise the issue of rectifying wages. In this regard, the various trade unions have only formally "coordinated" the suggestions made by the various departments and governing bodies to the government during the war, when the entire wage system was fixed, and have not exposed the shortcomings of various reward systems, resulting in confusion in wage issues. Trade unions and management agencies "harmoniously and coordinately" get along with each other, regardless of the fact that the shortcomings in wage work are hindering the improvement of production.

The Party has put forward the task of increasing average actual wages by about 30% in the Sixth Five-Year Plan, so the trade unions should study the issues of wages and technical quotas more deeply. The problem is that comprehensive measures should be taken to adjust wages and determine the labor quotas of workers, engineering technicians, and staff members. To this end, it is necessary to:

Adopt new wage rate tables and stipulate unified rate tables for similar enterprises under different competent authorities;

Increase wage rates so that the remuneration obtained according to the rate becomes the main part of the workers' wages and promotes the increase in labor productivity;

Ensure that workers in heavy industry, machinery manufacturing, construction, and in the eastern and northern regions of the country receive higher levels of labor remuneration;

Taking into account new technologies and advanced production organization, revise the current methods of rating rates;

Unify the regulations for the wage levels of workers in interconnected industries and eliminate the phenomenon of excessive job classification;

Eliminate the phenomenon of too many indicators for worker bonuses, and eliminate those reward methods that are not economically needed and that cause unreasonable ratios in the remuneration of various types of workers.

The reward system should be simple, clear, understandable to every worker, and should be linked to his specific labor indicators.

It is necessary to more firmly adopt technically based production quotas, and not to revise quotas in a rush, but to revise quotas when the technological procedures, production organization, and other related working conditions for improving labor productivity change.

The conditions for labor remuneration for leading personnel and engineering technicians should be revised so that a part of their wages is also based on the main economic indicators of the work.

The Soviet Ministry of Finance must formulate wage plans on the basis of simplifying the organization of administrative management.
		Pay More Attention to Satisfying the Needs and Demands
		of Workers and Staff Members

Comrades! Never in the history of human society has the needs of people, the satisfaction of people's material and cultural needs, been the object of constant care as in the Soviet socialist state.

The following question raised by Comrade Khrushchev in the summary report of the Party Central Committee is of great political and national economic significance: shortening the working day to 7 hours, and shortening the working day to 6 hours for juveniles and workers in important industries in some industrial sectors, reducing the working day by two hours on the day before holidays and festivals, transitioning to a 5-day work week and two days of rest in some production sectors, and increasing the wages of low-income staff members.

Workers, engineering technicians, and staff members will welcome these major measures stipulated by the Party, which are a new manifestation of the Party's concern for improving the material welfare and cultural level of the working people. (Applause)

Under capitalism, more than half of the working day is used to create profits and increase wealth for capitalists. According to the very inaccurate statistics of bourgeois economists, American workers work for capitalists without compensation for about 60% of the working day. Luther, the current vice chairman of the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations, said in Detroit on November 9 last year, "In the past 9 months, the largest automobile monopoly, 'General Motors', earned $300,000 per hour, making $7.2 million a day. For every dollar a worker earns in wages, it earns $1.22."

Soviet workers work for themselves and their country. Every hour of the Soviet worker's working day is used for the cause of communist construction and improving the welfare of the people. With the active participation and help of the trade unions, workers and staff members will make every effort to not only not reduce the output of products within the greatly shortened working day, but also rapidly increase the output of products, improve quality, and further reduce product costs. (Applause)

Shortening the working day increases the free time of workers and staff members, which requires trade union organizations to improve the cultural life of workers, to raise technical learning to a higher level together with management agencies, to take measures to improve the production skills of all workers, engineers, technicians, and staff members, and to publicize advanced experience and the latest achievements in science and technology. The trade unions and all their cultural organs (more than 10,000 clubs and cultural palaces, 104,000 red corners, 9,500 film screening units, and 17,000 libraries) will use the entire mass cultural work to solve these tasks.

The trade unions will do everything possible to maximize the use of the adjusted working day system to increase the achievements of communist construction.

The improvement of labor conditions is of great significance for the improvement of productivity. In the Fifth Five-Year Plan, more than 10 billion rubles were spent on improving technical safety equipment and the hygienic equipment of production.

The measures implemented in enterprises to improve labor conditions have had a great impact on reducing morbidity and increasing labor productivity; the expenditure on allowances for temporary loss of working ability has therefore been reduced.

In capitalist countries, the morbidity rate and production injuries are constantly increasing, while enterprise owners believe that the expenses used in labor protection and technical safety equipment are superfluous luxuries. In the United Kingdom, according to the statement of the former Minister of Labor, Walter Monckton, about 20 million working days are lost each year due to production injuries and occupational diseases. In France, from 1952 to 1954, accidents in production increased by 15%. In West Germany, injuries are growing particularly sharply, and the frenzied arms expansion has contributed to this situation in no small way. In the first half of 1955 alone, 1,117,000 production injuries occurred in West Germany.

In our country, the struggle to eliminate injuries and reduce morbidity is the responsibility of management agencies and trade union organizations, and their joint efforts have achieved undeniable results. However, at the same time, many enterprise leaders, with the tolerance of trade union agencies, do not care about improving the ventilation, lighting, and heating equipment in production sites.

The promotion of new lighting tools such as fluorescent lamps is very slow. The artificial lighting systems in some textile enterprises in Ivanovo Oblast have become so outdated that the lighting at the workplace only reaches one-seventh to one-tenth of the standard. It can be confirmed from the materials of the survey conducted by the Labor Protection Research Institute of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions under production conditions that labor productivity can be increased by 5% to 10% simply by improving lighting equipment.

Economic leaders do not pay enough attention to the issue of continuously supplying workers with work clothes and work shoes. The enterprises responsible for supplying often fail to supply work clothes and work shoes. For example, in 1955, the supply agencies gave the Kuznetsk United Steel Plant 1,518 fewer pairs of felt boots, and gave the Altai Tractor Factory 2,300 fewer pairs of leather shoes, 600 fewer pairs of felt boots, 1,300 fewer cotton coats, 1,000 fewer sets of work clothes, and 25,000 fewer pairs of gloves.

The Ministry of Textile Industry turns a deaf ear to the opinions raised by workers criticizing the poor quality of work clothes. The made garments and work clothes cannot be worn after being washed in water.

The production of work clothes and work shoes should be increased, their quality should be improved, unified standards for the free distribution of work clothes should be determined, and the sales of work clothes should be expanded. The number of work clothes sold now is very small.

The Soviet Union extensively implements social insurance, and guarantees pensions and subsidies in the event of employee illness, disability, old age, pregnancy, and childbirth.

The Sixth Five-Year Plan stipulates that allocations for social and cultural undertakings will increase from 154 billion rubles in 1955 to about 210 billion rubles in 1960.

Our Party plans to increase the amount of pensions and disability allowances, for which the Soviet people express great gratitude, believing that this is a manifestation of the Communist Party's concern for people - the builders of communism.

Under the supervision of the broad masses, the Soviet trade unions are striving to improve the living conditions of employees. The Party teaches us that supervision is a management function. Only in a society where the working people themselves are in power is it possible to enable employees to exercise social supervision.

As an economic school and a management school, trade unions should preside over criticism from below, should wage an uncompromising struggle against shortcomings, and should resolutely strive to eliminate these shortcomings.

In the Sixth Five-Year Plan, it is planned to build a total residential area of 205 million square meters with government funds, which is almost twice that of the Fifth Five-Year Plan. Completing 1% of this grand residential construction plan means building nearly 40,000 homes with two or three rooms. It can be seen from this how stubbornly the trade union organizations need to fight to strive for all agencies, enterprises, and construction agencies to complete the established tasks of residential construction.

As long as we carry out construction economically with the attitude of masters, strictly follow the Party's instructions to reduce construction costs, shorten construction periods, adopt factory-based construction methods, and eliminate waste in construction, we have every possibility of over-fulfilling this task.

Supervising the improvement of public catering is particularly important. Trade union organizations should never forget the development of public catering; and the development of public catering will help improve the lives of the working people on a socialist basis.

The survey on the income and expenditure arrangements of workers and staff members conducted by the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions shows that in 1954, the average expenditure on public catering for each family was 42 rubles. Due to the small number of canteens, there are still many staff members and their families who cannot use public canteens.

For example, at the Kuibyshev Locomotive Manufacturing Plant in Kolomna, only half of the workers on the day shift can dine in the public canteen.

Many enterprise leaders are no longer concerned about organizing public canteens, and have inexcusably relaxed the work of striving to adopt a self-service system. This method can expand the supply capacity of canteens and food stalls. There are many backward people among the trade union and economic leaders, and they become obstacles to the promotion of advanced forms of service for residents.

The director of a certain machinery manufacturing factory, Kalegrazov, said in a letter, "Self-service food in the workers' canteen is an unsightly and untimely form." It seems that this director is used to the situation where workers wait for half a day in the canteen or even many of them cannot eat. It is necessary to overcome this kind of inertia.

Social supervision should be aimed at the following aspects: making the work in trade reach a high level, eradicating some shortcomings in serving the working people, improving the quality of food, reducing the pricing of food, and organizing the work of the canteen very well. Implementing social supervision, regularly leading this work, and thoroughly handling the problems found during the supervision process are the most important responsibilities of the trade unions.

Collective contracts play an important role in improving the working and living conditions of employees in enterprises. Collective contracts stipulate that both economic leaders and factory committees are responsible for completing production plans and meeting the cultural and material needs of workers. Comrade Khrushchev rightly criticized the tolerant attitude of many trade union organizations towards economic leaders who have not fulfilled the provisions of collective contracts. It is necessary to resolutely fight against this shortcoming. Workers and staff members hope that the trade unions are defenders of their interests and protect their interests from those who violate Soviet laws. For trade union workers, there is no more glorious task than to fight for the consistent implementation of the Party's resolutions and the laws of the Soviet state aimed at improving the welfare of the working people.

Comrades! The Soviet trade unions are loyal to the ideas of proletarian internationalism and perseveringly consolidate and expand international contacts with trade unions in various countries. In the past four years, about 500 trade union and worker delegations from 74 countries have visited the Soviet Union. This has greatly developed and consolidated contacts with foreign worker organizations. The local organizations of the trade unions of the United States, Japan, and the United Kingdom have recently advocated expanding contacts with the Soviet trade unions and exchanging delegations.

We sincerely welcome such remarks and believe that it is beneficial to establish friendly relations with all trade union organizations regardless of political and religious beliefs. However, not everyone holds the same view as us. For example, the heads of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions oppose taking joint actions with the World Federation of Trade Unions and all national trade unions that participate in this organization, although the tasks of the trade unions in the struggle for the vital interests of the working people should be consistent.

What they dislike is that the Soviet trade unions carry out their work under the leadership of the Communist Party, and there are no strikes in the Soviet Union.

It is true that the Soviet trade unions carry out their work under the leadership of the working class party and its vanguard, the Communist Party. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, our working class has freed itself from capitalism, defended its glory and freedom in the battles against counter-revolution and foreign intervention, built a socialist society, and is unswervingly moving towards communism along the path pointed out by Lenin. (Applause) Our Party is constantly improving the role of the trade unions in meeting the growing material needs of employees.

Is it still worth wondering whether the Party is guiding the Soviet trade unions to strive to strengthen the power of the socialist country, which is truly mastered by workers, peasants, and intellectuals?

The rock-solid unity between the Party and the Soviet people does not suit the wishes of our enemies, but it has won the praise of progressive people all over the world. What can be done, we also do not like the ardent unity of the "free" trade union leaders with the imperialists, which is achieved at the expense of the vital interests of the working people. Everyone knows that the policy of cooperation between the right-wing social democrats and the imperialists has led to a decline in the living standards of the working people, an increase in unemployment, and rising prices in capitalist countries. According to the materials published by the United Nations, from 1948 to 1954, the cost of living for workers rose by about double in Brazil, Greece, and Iceland, by half in France, Norway, and Japan, and by 20% to 32% in Denmark, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Canada, and the United Kingdom.

In the Soviet Union, all the material wealth created by human labor belongs to society - the working

    什维尔尼克在苏共代表大会上的发言
    同志们！我们伟大的、由不朽的列宁在战斗中建立和锻炼的党的第二十次代表大会，将作为一个最突出的事件写入苏维埃国家英雄的史册上，它标志着社会主义经济更进一步的强有力的高涨，标志着马克思列宁主义创造性发展的新阶段。
    在苏联共产党中央委员会的总结报告中，尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志确定了我们党工作的宏伟纲领，深刻地分析了苏联国际和国内生活方面的问题，根据目前时代的情况创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义关于两种制度和平共处、关于防止战争的可能性、关于不同国家向社会主义过渡的形式与道路等问题的原理。
    在过去五年中，以列宁式的中央委员会为首的共产党在经济和文化建设各个领域中都取得了巨大的成就，巩固了苏维埃国家的威力，提高了它的国际威望。
    在关于第六个五年计划指示的报告中，尼·亚·布尔加宁同志叙述了在优先发展重工业、掌握新技术、广泛使用先进工艺的基础上进一步提高国民经济的计划。
    假如我们党没有以自己以前的全部活动来保证第五个五年计划的完成，那么苏联人民在第六个五年计划中的创造性劳动的巨大规模就会是不可能的。
    党带到自己第二十次代表大会上来的总结，是工人、农民、知识分子在英明引导我国沿着列宁道路前进的党的领导下进行的英勇劳动取得的。（掌声）
    共产党在第十九次代表大会以后的一切活动是在巩固同群众密不可分的联系的标志下展开的，浸透着对人民及其无穷无尽的创造力量的深深的信念。
    对我们党来说，同劳动人民的紧密联系是建设新社会的规律，因为共产主义是人民群众自觉的创造的结果。
    伟大的列宁曾经多次地强调指出，“只有相信人民，深入生气勃勃的人民创造的泉源的人才能胜利，才能掌握政权。”（列宁全集第26卷第259页）
    党依靠苏维埃、工会和共青团这些传导者，鼓舞工人、农民和知识分子去创造劳动功绩。苏联工会在共产党的领导下团结了群众为胜利地完成第五个五年计划而斗争，吸引它们进行政治、经济和文化建设，努力克服缺点，满足职工日益增长的物质和文化需要。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志在向第二十次党代表大会的报告中深刻地分析了苏联工会日益增长的作用，同时对阻碍工会胜利地解决党在共产主义建设现阶段中所提出的任务的严重缺点给予严厉而正确的批评。
    全苏工会中央理事会和各工会中央委员会在各企业的生活中、在各别部和主管机关的工作中遇到一些不良的现象，但是对这些缺点的批评是胆小的，没有尖锐地对经济机关提出切身重要的问题。所有这一切降低了工作水平和工会作为群众的战斗组织者的作用。
    工会在新社会建设的各个阶段都是党的政策的忠实传导者。无庸怀疑，工会将消除自己工作中的缺点，今后将不惜自己的力量光荣地担负起自己作为列宁式的共产主义学校的光荣作用。（掌声）
    争取对社会主义竞赛实行生气勃勃的领导
    同志们，第六个发展国民经济五年计划的宏伟和创造性工作的空前规模是令人惊叹的。
    这个计划的主要任务是，在优先发展生产资料的生产、不断提高技术、提高劳动生产率的基础上，保证一切工业部门、农业、人民的物质福利和文化水平的进一步提高。第六个五年计划的完成将使我们的国家走上经济发展的更高阶段。
    1960年，我国的生铁、钢、钢材的生产将要急剧地增长，煤、石油的开采将大大地增加，机床和机器的出产量将要提高，电力、化学品、日用品的生产将要上升，农作物的产量将要增加，畜牧业将要空前高涨。
    第六个五年计划是技术蓬勃进步、电气化和和平利用原子能的五年计划。
    我们的共产党除了人民的利益以外，没有其他的利益。把千百万人民团结在自己周围的列宁的党，把它的全部沸腾的精力和所有的智慧，用来争取共产主义的胜利实现。工人阶级、全体苏联人民根据自己的经验相信社会主义的劳动是建设新的、幸福的生活源泉。
    列宁写道：“千百年来都是替别人劳动，替剥削者做奴隶或苦工的人，经过了这样的时光之后，现在才第一次有可能来为自己工作，而且是靠一切最新技术和文化的成果来工作。”（列宁全集第26卷第368页）
    劳动生产率的真实结果体现在工农业产量的增长中，体现在国家对教育、保健事业、社会赡养的日益增加的拨款中，体现在以空前的规模建筑住宅和文化生活设施、不断地提高劳动人民的文化水平和物质福利中。
    苏联工会认为自己的主要的、最重要的任务是：教育广大群众对劳动采取共产主义的态度，引导他们的创造性主动精神去尽量提高劳动生产率——共产主义胜利的决定性条件。
    在尼·亚·布尔加宁同志的报告中令人信服地说明，第六个五年计划中规定的劳动生产率的增长数字，即工业至少提高50％、建筑业至少提高52％、铁路运输约提高34％，是迫切必需的，而且是完全可以实现的。
    第二十次代表大会关于第六个五年计划的指示草案确定了完成这些任务的具体道路。
    群众在全民的社会主义竞赛中表现出来的无穷尽的创造性，是保证不仅完成、而且超额完成第六个五年计划关于急剧提高劳动生产率的重要任务的强大的泉源。现阶段竞赛的特点在于：参加竞赛的人除了掌握先进的技术外，同时还改革陈旧的工艺规程、改进生产、利用现有的潜力，并且在这一基础上保证花费最少的工作时间而增加产量、改进质量和降低生产成本。这一点在全国为迎接第二十次党代表大会而展开的社会主义竞赛中得到了特别有力的证实，在这次竞赛中，成百成千的企业、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的职工取得了卓越的生产成就。
    莫斯科弗拉基米尔·伊里奇电工器材工厂的职工到12月1日就完成了1955年的生产计划，这个工厂在第五个五年计划的年代中使产量增加了一倍多，降低了生产成本42％。
    伏罗希洛夫州“中央—波科夫矿井”各生产队和工段之间展开了竞赛。采用了循环图表制的第六工段，在这个矿井迎接第二十次党代表大会的竞赛中获得了优胜。去年12月间这个工段的采煤计划完成了125％，1956年1月间又完成了142％。仅在1月份，这个工段的矿工们就超计划多开采了3，500吨煤。
    生产革新者和先进人物的队伍日益扩大，他们成为竞赛中一个巨大的动力。要成为革新者，就要精通自己的业务，善于运用和掌握新技术，利用先进科学成就。社会主义生产的先进人物在竞赛中发挥出自己的能力和才干，把自己的经验传授给别人，带动落后者。
    可以举出冶金工人中的许多革新者作为例子。萨波罗什炼钢厂的快速炼钢工人波梅东、萨罗什和德雅科诺夫等同志运用了氧气鼓风，把炼钢量提高了20％，并且把大容量熔炉的连续操作时间延长到540炉，而整个车间平均只达到470炉左右。兹拉陶斯特冶金工厂炼钢工人科兹洛夫、卡尔梅科夫和斯特鲁科夫同志把小容量马丁炉的连续操作时间延长到895炉，当时其他工厂中同样的马丁炉只能炼出400到450炉钢。列宁格勒许多企业中的革新者的人数单是在最近6个月内就增加了好几倍。“电力电工器材工厂”中的革新者在进一步改进生产方面作出了巨大的贡献。根据领班费多托夫同志的建议在厂内实行了把模锻工作转为联合作业的工序。压制极板用的新式联合冲压机代替了原有的两部冲压机，可以提高劳动生产率50％到60％。
    工厂中最费力的工序就是铣制涡轮发电机转子的槽。这道工序要花500台时。铣工柯什同志采用了带硬质合金刀片的圆形铣刀。这就使铣槽工序的劳动生产率提高到四倍。
    革新者的主动性，在企业、车间、工段完成和超额完成生产计划方面有很大的影响。但是革新运动的价值和意义是随着革新者的经验逐渐成为广大人民群众的财富而提高的。也正是因为这样，工会认为自己最主要的任务之一，就是除了增加革新者人数以外，还要使所有的工人都掌握先进的工作方法，提高自己在社会主义竞赛中的积极性。
    在解决这一任务方面，工会积极分子要起带头作用。工会积极分子以身作则带动群众，推广先进工作方法，把落后者提高到先进者的水平。
    例如，新彻卡西电气机车工厂一个工段的工会组长塞瓦斯基扬诺夫同志，在第五个五年计划期间内完成了14年的定额，并且把自己的经验传授给别的工人，结果这个工段的劳动生产率提高到两倍多。
    高尔基城的汽车工厂锻工车间工会组长锻工格里高里·马雷舍夫在本车间工人中和人处得很好。他在本工段推广了先进锻工的经验之后，结果每个工人完成的合乎技术的定额都在120％以上，而他自己则经常完成定额150％到160％。
    在伊凡诺佛混色织物联合工厂的纺纱生产中，普遍推广了工会组长卡尔科娃同志的经验。她在两台纺纱机上工作，完成每班定额125％到130％，这种例子是不少的，然而，工会还没有能够使每个工会积极分子在自己的生产工段中都成为社会主义竞赛的带头人。
    工会积极分子，首先是人数达到130万的工会组长，应当以身作则影响群众，提高社会主义竞赛的水平，推广生产革新者的经验。
    各厂之间、各区之间、各车间之间、各修理厂之间和个别工人之间的社会主义竞赛，应该是工会和经济机关精密地组织和用心地研究的对象。
    遗憾的是，很多工会组织和经济机关很少研究革新者的经验，不努力实行可以保证为高度生产效能的劳动创造条件的组织上和技术上的措施。
    很多企业的工会组织还很少去发现生产的潜力。例如，“鞑靼石油”联合企业的著名技工、快速工作者基码卓夫同志的钻探工作队，一年钻探了17，671公尺，大多数工作队完成了自己的年度计划，平均各钻探了9，830公尺，但同时却有40多个工作队完不成生产任务，每年平均只钻探5，500公尺。
    如果石油工业部和工会中央委员会关心到把所有的工作队即使是拉到完成计划的工作队的水平，那末单是“鞑靼石油”联合企业就能多钻探187，000公尺以上，或者使约80个新油井产油。
    在许多企业中，学习先进工作方法的学校得到了很大的发展，这些学校是积极采用和广泛推行生产革新者经验的有效的形式之一。这不是有着教学生的教员的那种普通学校。在这些学校里，革新者本人就当教员，他们在工作地点表演应该怎样进行操作，怎样取得良好的工作成绩。
    在1955年，列宁格勒五金工厂训练出了400多人，库兹涅茨克冶金联合工厂在先进工作方法学校中训练出了1，000多人。1955年上半年，在各企业的这种学校中训练出了160多万工人。
    工会一定要采取一切措施，以便在第六个五年计划中，使这种广泛掌握先进工作方法和提高工人的熟练程度的、经过试验的形式，得到更广泛的发展。
    在各企业间开始展开了各种形式的个人竞赛和集体竞赛，开展了生产革新者工作方法的宣传工作。出版了各种招贴画和小册子，组织了性质相近的企业各生产小组之间的互相参观和访问。生产革新者在生产会议上介绍自己的工作情况。各个工厂和车间之间的竞赛促进了经验的交流。
    在厂际竞赛过程中，乌拉尔机器工厂吸取了乌拉尔车辆工厂的增加电炉炉顶坚固性和使用自动化和半自动化焊接法的经验；而乌拉尔车辆工厂也从乌拉尔机器工厂学会了制造铸成刀具的方法的工艺规程和热钢玉刀具的使用方法。
    必须用各种办法鼓励各企业的工作队进行互相访问。这种群众工作的形式，如果组织得好，就能够收到良好的效果。
    在执行第六个五年计划的时候，不倦地研究改进生产、发展技术和先进工艺规程的发明者和合理化建议者，是能够起重大的作用的。在第五个五年计划的四年中，各企业中共提出了600万件以上的合理化建议，其中有350万件已经应用到生产中去了。
    技术进步速度的加快，在很大程度上取决于发明者和合理化建议者的创造性的主动性和积极性。工会组织应当更加关心发明者和合理化建议者，在工作中帮助他们，坚决为在生产中应用已经被采纳的建议和发明而斗争。必须吸收工程师和技术人员来领导合理化建议和发明的运动。在大规模开展合理化建议和发明的运动中，工程师和技术员应当表现更大的主动性并且给运动以实际的帮助。
    联合了约40万苏联专家和工人生产革新者的科学技术协会，应该站在为技术进步而斗争的前列。去年科学技术协会曾经举行了两万次以上的科学技术界代表大会和会议，380次竞赛，并且采取了其他群众性的措施。这些会议和活动的结果，证明了工程技术界的积极性和创造性能够发掘出何等巨大的进一步发展生产的潜力。
    管理机关有责任保证采取组织上和技术上的措施，以便尽速地把合理化建议者和发明者的建议以及科学技术协会所推荐的东西运用到生产中去。
    帮助揭发和克服劳动组织中的缺点的生产会议，有助于胜利完成包括各项技术经济指标的生产计划。应该坦白地说，很多经济领导者不和工人商量改进生产的问题，因此而造成的损失很多。他们忘了直接和工人们交谈，要知道，工人们凭丰富的智慧能够在改进对企业的经常的经济领导方面、在消除妨碍社会主义生产改进的官僚主义障碍方面，提出很多有价值的意见。
    有许多企业按时地举行生产会议，它们给改进工作带来很多好处。在波多尔斯克的加里宁机械工厂的生产会议上曾采纳了多项建议，实行这些建议的结果，就腾出了约500个单位设备，腾出了11，000平方公尺以上的生产场地，提高了劳动生产率，改进了产品质量和降低了产品成本。
    彼得罗夫冶金工厂第三号平炉车间，由于实现了生产会议上所通过的建议，冶金的工艺规程改善了，钢产量每月增加了128吨。
    虽然生产会议的工作无可争辩地是有效果的，但是，许多党、经济和工会组织仍然对它的意义估计不足，很少召开会议，不努力实现所采纳的建议，于是就压制了工人的生产积极性。
    工会中党员干部的职责，就是要领导工人、工程技术人员和职员的日益增长的积极性，引导他们的努力来完成关于进一步发展国民经济的第六个五年计划。
    党给工会提出了有巨大国家意义的任务——对社会主义竞赛进行日常的领导。但是，这个任务的执行情况仍然还落后于生活的要求。竞赛是充满了社会劳动的高度纪律性的群众的创造性积极性的表现。它不容忍任何的墨守成规。具体领导各企业、车间、生产队的竞赛，组织群众去提高劳动生产率，这就是决定事业成功的主要工作形式。
    各企业运用的新技术，要求工人有专门知识和善于利用它们，同时也会加速提高干部的文化技术水平。由于技术发展的影响，工人阶级的成员也在发生变化，受过七年制、中等和高等教育的工人和职员越来越多。
    到1955年底，工人、工程技术人员中25岁以下受过七年制、中等和高等教育的人，乌拉尔机器工厂计有64％，库兹涅茨克联合钢铁厂有55％，伊凡诺佛大纺织工厂有58％，库兹巴斯“科克索瓦雅”矿井有32％。
    所有这些都使得工会有责任更熟练地领导竞赛，发挥创造性积极性，坚决采纳先进的生产经验，保证更广泛地公布竞赛的结果和正确地采用物质和精神奖励的形式来鼓励先进生产者——在个人、生产队、厂际和全苏社会主义竞赛中的优胜者。
    必须保证根本改善对竞赛中的先进工作者的奖励制度，改善授予全苏社会主义竞赛中的优秀企业、车间和生产队以流动旗帜、荣誉状以及授予优胜者奖金的制度，以便至少把75％的奖励金都给予创造物质财富的工人。
    工会的全部组织和教育工作都应该服从动员职工群众来胜利完成第六个五年计划的任务。
        加强各个工会对劳动定额
        和工资定额问题的注意
    同志们！党和政府经常非常关心劳动定额和工资定额的问题。工资是提高劳动生产率以及改善职工的物质福利的强有力的杠杆。工会和管理机关应该保证实行工作人员从物质利益上关心自己劳动成果的列宁原则。在战后年代里，全苏工会中央理事会和各工会中央委员会没有认真地研究劳动和工资问题，尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志在自己报告中所指出的这一点是完全正确的。
    各个部曾经实行过许多劳动工资制度来解决某些生产任务和消除薄弱的环节。但是，在目的达到以后，奖励制度却没有修订，而继续机械地加以执行。和其他部门一样，煤炭工业的工资率没有改变，而对工资的附加种类却增加了：超额奖励金、开采炼焦用煤的奖金、完成循环工作制的奖金和其他种类的补贴。例如，“卡拉干达采煤”联合企业第一○七号—一○八号煤矿联合机操使者的助手科洛宁同志，在1955年10月得了6，355卢布的工资。在这笔工资中，除了按计件工资发给的直接工资2，172卢布外，从完成定额80％起算的超额奖金是1，653卢布，超额完成开采炼焦用煤计划的奖金是1，406卢布，超额完成循环工作制的奖金是1，068卢布，其他的补贴56卢布。这样，工资率在整个工资中的比重只占25％。
    这些补贴算什么呢？按其实质来说，这是各种各样的奖金，目的是为了达到同一个指标——完成计划。在煤炭工业中，工人工资率的比重占57％，而在许多情况下甚至只占25％。
    这个例子说明了经济机关对规定工资制度的态度是不正确的。
    在木材加工工业各企业中，劳动生产率增长和工资提高的比率不正常。在近五年中劳动生产率增长了26％，而工人的平均工资增加了30％。这是由于森林工业对于它所获得的充足的机械利用得不好，也由于劳动组织得不能令人满意。
    在许多企业中，确定生产定额时仍然对技术的成就缺乏考虑。企业的领导者不注意制定技术上有根据的定额。不是生产定额决定工资，而是定额适应于已有的工资水平。经验—统计定额现在还是凌驾于先进的技术定额之上。
    在规定工程技术人员和职员的工资的工作中也有严重的缺点。财政部实行的职员工资国家标准无人过问。同一职位的工作人员得到各种偶然确定的工薪。工长、工艺技师、段长的薪金常常低于属他们领导的工作者。
    全苏工会中央理事会和各工会中央委员会没有表现出必要的主动性来纠正缺点和提出整顿工资的问题。各工会在这方面仅止于形式主义地把各部和主管机关在战时向政府提出的建议“协调一致”，那时就固定了整个工资制度，没有揭露各种奖励制度的缺陷，以致在工资问题上造成了混乱。工会和管理机关彼此“和好和协调”地相处，而不顾工资工作中的缺点在阻碍着生产的改进。
    党提出了在第六个五年计划中平均提高实际工资约30％的任务，因此，工会应该更深入地研究工资和技术定额的问题。问题在于应当采取全盘的措施来调整工资和确定工人、工程技术人员和职员的劳动定额。为此，必须：
    采用新的工资等级表，为不同主管部门所属的同类企业规定统一的等级表；
    提高工资率，以便使按定率所取得的报酬成为工人工资的主要部分并且促进劳动生产率的提高；
    保证重工业、机器制造业、建筑业以及在国家东部和北部各地区的工人得到较高水平的劳动报酬；
    考虑到新技术和先进的生产组织，修改现行的定率评定办法；
    统一相互关联的各行业的工人工资等级的规定，并且消除职业划分过细的现象；
    消除工人奖金的指标过多的现象，并且消除那些经济上没有需要的而且会使各类工人报酬造成不合理的比率的奖励办法。
    奖励制度应该简单明了、对每个工人都明白易懂，并且应该同他的具体的劳动指标联系起来。
    必须更坚决地采纳技术上有根据的生产定额，不要突击式地修改定额，要在工艺规程和生产组织以及其他有关提高劳动生产率的工作条件改变的情况下修改定额。
    应该修改领导人员和工程技术人员的劳动报酬条件，以便使他们的工资的一部分也以工作的主要经济指标为根据。
    苏联财政部必须在简化行政管理机关的编制的基础上制定工资方案。
    更加关心满足工人和职员的需要和要求
    同志们！在人类社会历史上从来还没有像苏维埃社会主义国家这样把人的需要、满足人的物质和文化的需要作为经常关怀的对象。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在党中央委员会的总结报告中提出的下面这个问题是具有重大的政治意义和国民经济意义的：把工作日缩短到7小时，而把少年和一些工业部门的重要行业的工人的工作日缩短到6小时，在休息日和节日的前一天把工作日减少两小时，在一些生产部门中转变为每周5天工作和两天休息，提高收入低的工作人员的工资。
    工人、工程技术人员和职员将欢迎党规定的这些重大的措施，这些措施是党关怀提高劳动人民的物质福利和文化水平的新的表现。（掌声）
    在资本主义下，一半以上的工作日是为资本家创造利润和增加财富的。根据资产阶级经济学家的很不准确的统计，美国工人在60％左右的工作日中无偿地替资本家工作。美国劳工联合会—产业工会联合会的工会联合会现任副主席路德去年11月9日在底特律说，“在最近9个月中最大的汽车垄断公司‘通用汽车公司’每小时获得30万美元，一天赚720万美元。工人获得一块美元的工资，而它却赚1元2角2分。”
    苏联工人是为自己和自己的国家工作的。苏联劳动者的工作日的每个小时，都是用于进行共产主义建设的事业和提高人民福利。在工会的积极参加和帮助下，工人和职员将作出一切努力，以便在大大缩短了的工作日内不但不减少、而且还急速增加产品的产量，提高质量和进一步降低产品成本。（掌声）
    缩短工作日使工人和职员的空闲时间加多，这要求工会组织改进劳动者的文化生活，同管理机关一起把技术的学习提高到更高的水平，采取措施来提高所有工人、工程师、技术人员和职员的生产熟练程度，宣传先进经验和科学技术的最新成就。工会和它们的所有文化机关（10，000多个俱乐部和文化宫、104，000个红角、9，500个放映电影的单位和17，000个图书馆）都将把整个群众文化工作用来解决这些任务。
    工会将尽一切力量最大限度地利用调整后的工作日制度来增多共产主义建设成就。
    劳动条件的改善对于生产率的提高有巨大的意义。在第五个五年计划中，在改善技术安全设备和生产的卫生设备方面花了100多亿卢布。
    企业中实行的改善劳动条件的措施，对于降低患病率和提高劳动生产率产生了很大影响；对暂时失去劳动能力的津贴开支因而减少了。
    在资本主义国家里，患病率和生产的外伤事故不断增加，而企业主却认为用在劳动保护方面的费用和技术安全设备方面的费用是多余的奢侈品。在英国，根据前劳工大臣华尔特·蒙克顿的声明，由于生产的伤害和职业病每年要损失约两千万个工作日。在法国，从1952年到1954年止，生产中的不幸事件增加了15％。在西德，外伤事故尤其剧烈地增长着，狂热的军备扩张在不小的程度上助长了这种情况。仅仅在1955年的上半年，西德就发生了1，117，000件生产的外伤事故。
    在我们的国家，为消灭外伤事故和降低患病率而斗争是管理机关和工会组织的责任，它们的共同努力已经取得了无可争辩的成绩。但是，与此同时，很多的企业领导者在工会机关的容忍之下，不关心改善生产场所的通风、照明和取暖等设备。
    像日光灯这种新的照明工具推行得很缓慢。伊凡诺佛州有些纺织企业的人工照明系统已经很不合时了，以致工作地点的照明只达到标准的七分之一到十分之一。从全苏工会中央理事会劳动保护研究所在生产条件下所进行的调查的材料中可以确认，只要改善照明设备就可以使劳动生产率提高5％到10％。
    经济领导人员对不间断地供应工人工作服和工作鞋的问题是注意得很不够的。负责供应的企业常常供应不上工作服和工作鞋。譬如，供应机关在1955年少给库兹涅茨克联合钢铁厂1，518双毡靴，少给阿尔泰拖拉机工厂2，300双皮鞋、600双毡靴、1，300件棉衣、1，000套工装和25，000双手套。
    纺织工业部对工人们提出的批评工作服质量很差的意见不闻不问。制成的服装和工作服一下水之后就不能穿了。
    应当增加工作服和工作鞋的生产，提高它们的质量，确定免费发给工作服的统一标准以及扩大工作服的销售量，现在出售的工作服的数量很少。
    苏联广泛实行社会保险，在职工生病、残废、年老、怀孕和生育的情况下，保证给予养老金和补助金。
    第六个五年计划规定，社会文化事业方面的拨款要从1955年的1，540亿卢布增加到1960年的2，100亿卢布左右。
    我们的党计划提高养老金和残废者补助金的金额，苏联人民对这表示极大的感谢，认为这是共产党对人——共产主义建设者——的关怀的表现。
    苏联工会正在在广大群众的监督下争取改进职工的居住生活条件。党教导我们说，监督是一种管理职能。只有在劳动人民自己掌握政权的社会中，才有可能使职工来实行社会监督。
    工会作为经济的学校和管理的学校，应该主持自下而上的批评，应该对缺点作不调和的斗争，应该坚决地争取消除这些缺点。
    在第六个五年计划中，计划用政府经费建造总居住面积达20，500万平方公尺的住宅，这几乎为第五个五年计划的两倍。完成这个宏大的住宅建筑计划的1％，就是建造起将近4万套有两、三个房间的住宅。由此可见，工会组织需要如何顽强地为争取使一切机关、企业、建筑机关完成住宅建设的既定任务而斗争。
    只要以主人翁的态度节约地进行建筑，严格按照党的指示降低造价，缩短施工期限，采用工厂化的建筑方法，消灭建筑上的浪费现象，我们有一切可能来超额完成这个任务。
    对改善公共饮食业进行监督，特别重要。工会组织一分钟也不应该忘记发展公共饮食业；而发展公共饮食业就有助于在社会主义的基础上改善劳动人民的生活。
    全苏工会中央理事会所进行的对工人和职员收支安排情况的调查表明，1954年平均每一个家庭花在公共饮食业上的开支是42卢布。由于食堂少，还有许多工作人员及其家属不能利用公共食堂。
    例如，科洛姆纳的古比雪夫机车制造厂，日班工人只有半数能在公共食堂用膳。
    许多企业的领导人现在已经不再关心组织公共食堂，不可容忍地放松了争取采用自己取用制的工作。而这种办法可以扩大食堂和食品小卖部的供应能力。在工会和经济领导者之中有不少是落后的人，他们成为推行先进的为居民服务的形式的障碍。
    某一机器制造厂的厂长卡列格拉佐夫在一封信里说，“在工人食堂里自取食物是一种不雅观的和不合时宜的形式”。看来，这位厂长对于工人在食堂里等半天甚至其中有很多人吃不上饭的情况习惯了。必须克服这一类的惰性。
    社会的监督应当针对着以下的几个方面：使贸易方面的工作达到高度水平，铲除在为劳动人民服务方面的一些缺点，改进食品的质量，减低食品的定价和很好地组织食堂的工作。实行社会监督，经常地领导这一工作，彻底处理监督过程中发现的问题——这是工会的最重要的职责之一。
    集体合同在改善企业中职工的劳动和生活条件方面起着重要的作用。集体合同规定经济领导人和工厂委员会双方都对完成生产计划和满足工人在文化和物质生活上的需要负有责任。赫鲁晓夫同志正当地批评了很多工会组织对经济领导人没有完成集体合同的规定所采取的容忍态度。必须坚决地同这种缺点作斗争。工人和职员希望工会是他们的利益的保卫者，使他们的利益不受破坏苏联法律的人的侵犯。对于工会工作者来说，没有比为一贯地执行旨在改善劳动人民的福利的党的各项决议和苏维埃国家的法律而斗争更光荣的任务了。
    同志们！苏联工会忠于无产阶级国际主义思想，坚持不懈地巩固和扩大同各国工会的国际联系。在最近4年中，74个国家的约500个工会和工人代表团访问了苏联。这使得同外国工人组织的联系大大发展和巩固了。美国、日本和英国工会的地方组织最近主张扩大同苏联工会的联系和互相交换代表团。
    我们真诚地欢迎这样的言论，并且认为同不分政治和宗教信仰的所有工会组织建立友好联系是有益的。但是，并非所有的人都抱着和我们相同的看法，例如，国际自由工会联合会的头子们反对同世界工会联合会和一切参加这个组织的全国性工会采取共同行动，虽然工会在争取劳动人民切身利益的斗争中的任务应当是一致的。
    他们所不喜欢的是：苏联工会是在共产党的领导下进行工作的，苏联没有罢工。
    不错，苏联工会是在工人阶级的政党和它的先锋队共产党的领导下进行工作的。在共产党的领导下，我国工人阶级摆脱了资本主义，在反对反革命和外国干涉的战斗中捍卫了自己的光荣和自由，建成了社会主义社会，并且确信不移地沿着列宁所指出的道路走向共产主义。（掌声）我们的党正在不断提高工会在满足职工日益增长的物质需求方面的作用。
    党引导苏联工会为加强由工人、农民和知识分子作真正主人的社会主义国家的威力而斗争，难道这还值得奇怪吗？
    党和苏联人民坚如磐石的团结是不合我们的敌人的心愿的，然而却赢得了全世界进步人士的赞扬。这有什么办法呢，我们也不喜欢“自由”工会领袖们同帝国主义者的热切的团结，这种团结是靠牺牲劳动人民的切身利益而实现的。大家知道，右翼社会党人同帝国主义者合作的政策在资本主义各国导致了劳动人民生活水平的下降、失业人口的增加和物价的上涨。根据联合国所公布的材料，从1948年到1954年间，工人的生活费在巴西、希腊、冰岛约上升了一倍，在法国、挪威、日本上升了半倍，丹麦、荷兰、意大利、西班牙、加拿大、英国上升了20％到32％。
    在苏联，人的劳动所创造的一切物质财富都属于社会——劳动人民自己。在我国，实际工资不是在降低，而是在一年年地提高。工业部门的实际工资1955年比1940年提高了91％。
    这些成就引起了工人阶级团结的敌人的愤怒和憎恨。他们不顾真理，继续对苏联工会散布最肮脏的诽谤，企图在苏联工会和资本主义国家工会之间制造不和。但是，凡是“自由”工会头子们所不能理解或是不愿理解的东西，工人们都是很清楚地理解的。希拉德·埃利斯是美国劳工联合会—产业工会联合会主席米尼先生的同胞，他参加了美国工人代表团访问了苏联。希拉德·埃利斯了解了苏联工人的日常生活和生活条件，并且写了一个访苏报告。他在这个在美国发表的报告中通俗地解释了为什么在苏联没有、也不可能有罢工。他写道：“可以设想一下，难道一个在建筑自己的房屋的木匠会罢工来阻碍为自己和自己的家庭建筑住宅吗？一个苏联工人就是这么一个建筑自己的房屋的木匠。”很难比这个美国工人说得再好了。
    米尼先生会希望苏联工会组织罢工、阻碍共产主义建设。而他自己却反对工人在资本主义企业中所组织的罢工。
    米尼先生不久前在全国制造商协会代表大会上发表了这么一篇演说，他说：“我在一生中从来没有罢过工，从来也没有领导过罢工，从来没有指使任何人进行罢工，从来没有同罢工纠察队发生过任何关系。”看，米尼先生是如何了解工会自由的。美国工人以及其他国家的工人不赞同这种政策，不赞同“自由”工会的政策，这是无需说明的。
    苏联工会正在为实现工人运动的团结而斗争，它敦促国际自由工会联合会共同为劳动人民的切身利益、为世界和平而努力。 （掌声）
    苏联工会曾经并且将来也要为工会的权利而斗争。全苏工会中央理事会代表所有的工会对奥地利内政部长赫麦尔采取警察“判决”来禁止团结着欧洲、亚洲、拉丁美洲、黑色非洲的8，500多万职工的世界工会联合会进行活动表示愤慨。整个进步人类都谴责这一蛮横的行动，认为它是伤害参加世界工会联合会的劳动人民的荣誉和良心的可耻行动。
    苏联工会将扩大和加深同世界各国工会的兄弟般的联系，将加强国际工人运动队伍的团结。
    同志们！关于第六个五年计划的指示草案是在工农业中的工人和专家最广泛地参与下制定的。在最近半年中举行了成千成万次工人集会来讨论各企业的五年计划。收集了大量的目的在于发展生产、改进组织、提高劳动生产率的宝贵建议。
    劳动人民的爱国主义的首倡精神和全面的生产经验，有助于更全面地确定在第六个五年计划中发展国民经济各部门的任务，有助于发掘社会主义工业、运输业、机器拖拉机站和国营农场所拥有的巨大潜力。新五年计划反映了我国各族人民的意志和愿望，向全世界显示了社会主义经济制度对资本主义制度的根本长处和巨大优越性。（掌声）这个宏伟的计划的实现将使和平、民主和社会主义的力量能够对战争、殖民压迫和资本主义奴役力量取得新的胜利。
    全体苏联人民将一致赞同第六个五年计划，并且将拿出自己的全付精力来胜利地完成这个计划。
    计划所规定的共产主义建设的宏伟远景，使苏联人民为自己的伟大祖国、为英明的共产党——劳动人民久经考验的领袖而感到自豪和深感高兴。（掌声）在我们国家中，党和人民是不可分开的。苏联人民热爱共产党、无比地信任共产党、热情地忠于党的共产主义的伟大旗帜。（掌声）
    共产党之所以强大是因为它在思想上和组织上是牢不可破地统一的，是因为它钢铁般地团结在体现着党的集体意志、组织和鼓舞苏联人民取得胜利的经验丰富的列宁式的中央委员会周围。
    党中央委员会在第十九次代表大会后所恢复起来的列宁的集体领导原则，成了我们党的全部活动的坚实基础，它曾经保证并且正在保证着创造性地运用马克思列宁主义，估计当前的局势和由此而产生的任务，保证所采取的决定的正确性和在争取实现这些决定的斗争中的高度原则性。
    苏联工会在第二十次党代表大会的决议的鼓舞下将动员职工们的创造性去完成和超额完成第六个五年计划，去争取共产主义建设的新胜利。
    请允许我向第二十次党代表大会保证：苏联工会今后仍然将是共产党的忠实助手，是争取彻底实现战无不胜的马克思列宁主义思想的积极战士。（暴风雨般的掌声）
