The Beijing Municipal Education Bureau, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the Beijing Municipal Youth Federation jointly organized remedial classes for high school students awaiting employment after suspension of school, which began on March 15th. This is to help young people in society with a high school sophomore level of education or higher to review and supplement their high school courses and actively prepare for this year's college entrance examinations.

There are more than 900 students in the remedial classes, divided into science and engineering courses and liberal arts courses for study. The teaching content mainly refers to the college entrance examination syllabus, combined with the students' academic situation. Teachers of each subject formulate study outlines to guide students in reviewing and learning the three-year high school curriculum.

The remedial classes mainly adopt the method of large lectures and regular Q&A sessions to answer difficult questions. In addition, self-study groups are organized for self-study, and a necessary system of homework checks and examinations is established. The entire period is set at 4 months, with 4 hours of lectures per day, and is expected to end in early July.
