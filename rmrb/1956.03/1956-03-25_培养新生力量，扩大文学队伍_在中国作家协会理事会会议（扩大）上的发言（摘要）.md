    Cultivate New Strengths, Expand the Literary Ranks
    — Excerpts from a Speech at the Expanded Meeting of the Council of the Chinese Writers Association
    Mao Dun
    The continuous emergence of new people and the rapid growth of the younger generation are important characteristics of our superior social system. On the literary front, as on other fronts, a large number of new forces have poured into our ranks of writers. For example, in the selected collection of literary works from the past two years, the vast majority of the selected works were written by newly emerging young authors. Another set of "Selected Works of Young Literary Creation" includes works by 188 authors, all of whom have started writing in recent years. According to statistics, the editorial departments of local literary journals receive an average of more than a thousand submissions each month, and at least four to five hundred. Among these large numbers of contributors, more than 70% are amateur writers from factories, rural areas, the military, schools, and government agencies. According to our preliminary investigation, since the founding of the People's Republic of China, there are more than a thousand young writers who have consistently published works in various journals and newspapers and have a certain level of writing skill, half of whom are relatively excellent, and many are talented.
    The potential strength of the new generation of Chinese literature is very strong. These new authors have brought new voices and injected new blood into our literature. Their common characteristic is a keen sense of new things and an abundant enthusiasm for life and struggle. They are worthy of being a vital force in our literary cause.
    However, this situation should not make us complacent. Even if we add up the old generation of writers and the young writers, our literary ranks are still too small. The Chinese Writers Association has only more than five hundred members, and even with this new batch of authors, there are only more than a thousand people. The reason why our team is so small is closely related to the weaknesses and errors in our work. Even these authors who have already shown literary talent still have shortcomings, and their works clearly show: a shallow understanding of life, a lack of originality and unique style, many works still bear traces of imitation, they are not yet proficient in using language, and their artistic expression is not strong, etc. Among them, some are still infected with a rather strong bourgeois individualism. They lack a correct understanding of the literary cause, regard creation as a means to achieve personal fame and gain, or, having just published a few articles, become conceited, arrogant, and detached from the masses. The tendency to disregard politics and despise the study of Marxism is also quite common. All these hinder the growth and development of young authors. And this just shows that they urgently need help, political and professional help.
    The basic shortcomings of the Writers Association in cultivating young writers are that the leadership lags behind the masses and understanding lags behind reality. For a long time, we have underestimated the strength of young authors, so we have not seriously carried out the work of cultivating young authors. On the contrary, in the work of the Writers Association, and in some publications led by the Writers Association, a snobbish and cold or even打击 attitude has often been adopted towards new forces. The Writers Association also has a rather serious tendency of closed-doorism in the work of developing membership. Before the recent approval of a group of new members by the Presidium, only 3.7% of the members of the Writers Association were between the ages of twenty and thirty. It can be seen that the proportion of young authors in the membership is very small.
    It should be said that the editorial departments of many literary journals have achieved success in the work of cultivating young writers, among which the "Changjiang Wenyi" editorial department is more prominent. With their help and encouragement, many excellent young authors have emerged. In addition, "Juben" and "Tianjin Daily Literary Weekly" have also done a good job in this regard. However, on the whole, this work still has great shortcomings.
    The crude literary criticism that was once quite prevalent also seriously打击 the creative enthusiasm of young authors. In recent years, this kind of crude criticism has been relatively less, but truly enthusiastic and scientific analysis of the beneficial comments of young writers' works is still rarely seen.
    The Writers Association has not done a good job in mobilizing, organizing, and urging old writers to do the work of cultivating young writers. The task of old writers is not only to create themselves, but also to strive to cultivate successors to literature. This is a social responsibility that is as important as creation. Gorky and Lu Xun are our best examples. Like loving mothers, they nourished the young generation of writers with their own milk. Some of our writers have learned the spirit of Gorky and Lu Xun very well, but many writers still lack enthusiasm for this work, and they regard helping young writers as an extra burden.
    Coexisting with the above-mentioned major shortcomings and errors, there are also other shortcomings and errors. The Writers Association ran a literary workshop, which has enrolled and graduated three classes of students. It has done some work and achieved certain results in cultivating young writers. However, due to the erroneous ideological style of certain leaders of the predecessor of the workshop, the Central Literary Research Institute, a decadent bourgeois ideology was spread among the students. They departed from the party spirit principle of literature and advocated the so-called "one-bookism," encouraging young authors to take the acquisition of personal fame and status and the attainment of personal "immortality" as the purpose of creation (one book); they openly advocated personal worship; and openly advocated pride. Under the influence of this ideology, individualism grew in many students of the literary workshop, and a tendency to break away from politics arose. The Presidium of the Writers Association also failed to check and correct this phenomenon in a timely manner.
    In addition, in the work of helping young authors, there are also undesirable tendencies of forcing growth or doing everything for them. For young people who have just published one or two works, sometimes excessive praise is given, instead of pointing out their shortcomings while affirming their achievements and making strict demands on them. This makes some young authors dizzy and complacent. Sometimes they are too impatient to hope that amateur young authors will become professional writers, so they are prematurely transferred from their original work, which makes the original vigorous seedlings gradually wither. Our certain newspaper editorial departments often use the method of doing everything for them to thoroughly rewrite the original manuscript of young authors and publish it.
    Thoroughly overcoming the shortcomings and errors in our work, fully utilizing our existing experience, actively helping young authors, and more rapidly and in greater quantities cultivating the vital forces of our literature, this is the urgent task of our Writers Association and all writers.
    The key to realizing this task is to oppose conservatism, oppose the tendency to underestimate young authors, and oppose the snobbish attitude towards new forces.
    We must provide comprehensive help to young authors, which is to care for and help them politically, ideologically, professionally, and in their lives. Young writers must first be advanced elements in society and active socialist fighters. It is necessary to prevent them from breaking away from politics and life, and to make them understand from the beginning of their writing that the literary cause is the cause of the people and that creative labor is a serious and arduous labor. Writers of our era can only work for the people. Only by constantly learning from life and striving to master Marxism-Leninism as a weapon can they keep pace with the times and life and become advanced writers of this era.
    Writers need to deeply familiarize themselves with the life they write about, and also need to have broad life knowledge. As far as young authors are concerned, they should first go deep into the life they are familiar with for a long time and understand everything in this kind of life (that is, establish a base of life). At the same time, they should enrich their life knowledge through reading books and newspapers, listening to reports, and other indirect methods.
    How to combine the work at hand and amateur writing well is a common and must-be-resolved problem. An excellent amateur young author should also be an excellent worker who actively completes work tasks. But it must also be pointed out that the attitude of the leaders of some units towards young amateur authors is incorrect; they do not distinguish between right and wrong, and regard amateur writing as not being at ease with work, and put the hat of fame and gain on it. Instead of adopting education, help, and encouragement methods to young people who do amateur writing, they ridicule, discriminate, and打击. We call on young people who aspire to amateur writing to respect the leaders of their units and actively complete their work tasks. At the same time, we also ask the leaders of various units to cherish and educate young people who do amateur writing and actively help them become both active workers and persistent amateur writers. We also solemnly tell young people who do amateur writing: Actively completing the task at hand and insisting on amateur writing are not only not contradictory, but can be well combined. The problem lies in his creative attitude. If the creative attitude of an amateur young author is based on reality and seeks truth from facts, that is to say, when he plans to write, if he draws themes from the life he is most familiar with and plans the scale of his work according to his writing experience, then he will not only not feel the contradiction between the work at hand and amateur writing, but will also realize that the more actively and deeply he engages in the work at hand, the richer the source of themes will be, and the clearer and more profound his view of problems will be, so his writing will gradually improve. Those young people who loudly complain that their work at hand "hampers" their amateur writing, or "束缚" their literary "genius," and even before they have written a work, write letters everywhere, citing constitutional provisions, and requesting to be transferred from work to specialize in writing, we think are unrealistic and have lofty ambitions.
    Many young authors do not understand that a writer needs to have a high degree of artistic and cultural accomplishment. They have incorrect views on learning literary theory and classical literature; they also do not pay much attention to various scientific and cultural knowledge. They mistakenly believe that only literary critics need theoretical knowledge, and creators do not; but they do not know that literary theory is both a weapon to guide creation, and writers need to study literary theory. The incorrect view of classical literature has produced many deviations in learning. One is to despise classical literature, thinking that there is nothing to learn, and the other is to regard classical literature as a "trick book." Learning the artistic skills of classical writers is of course necessary, but the high artistry of classical literature should not be simplified into "tricks" that can be used casually. Young authors should also have the necessary scientific and cultural knowledge, and should strive to become a person with a high degree of accomplishment.
    What methods and steps should we take to carry out the work of cultivating young authors? (1) Establish literary groups in various medium-sized and above cities so that the literary study of the vast number of young literary enthusiasts can be carried out in an organized and led manner. (2) Improve the work of literary workshops, hold short-term training courses in order to train young authors more widely, and prepare conditions for establishing a regular literary academy. When conditions permit, major and medium-sized cities can hold literary lectures. Through various methods, conduct tutoring work for young authors in a planned and focused manner. (3) Convene a young literary creation conference every one or two years to discuss the works of young authors, exchange creative experiences, and answer various questions about creation for young authors. Compile and publish an anthology of excellent works by young writers every year. (4) Organize, mobilize, and urge writers to engage in the work of specifically helping young authors. In addition to taking the form of giving reports, lectures, and participating in symposiums for young authors as needed, writers should especially establish individual contacts with young authors and provide individual assistance (that is, "apprenticeship"). (5) Strengthen the editorial departments of the Writers Association's various publications so that they can use greater efforts to cultivate young writers. (6) Strengthen the criticism of young authors' works. Local literary leading organs and journal editorial departments should enthusiastically care about the creation of young people and make the organization of criticism and discussion a regular work. (7) Cultivate new forces for theoretical criticism work. The Writers Association and its local branches should establish theoretical criticism groups and absorb young critics to participate. Each journal editorial department should regard contacting and helping young theoretical critics as its important task. (8) The Writers Association should cooperate with relevant parties to organize forces to compile a concise history of Chinese literature and a history of modern Chinese literature, as well as teaching materials for literary studies. The Writers Association should assist relevant departments in compiling and selecting literary teaching materials for primary and secondary schools.
    Finally, in order to give young people more opportunities to publish their works, it is hoped that the daily newspapers of various provinces and cities will consider adding a "literary supplement" once a week or every three days as a garden dedicated to young authors to publish their works.

    培养新生力量，扩大文学队伍
    ——在中国作家协会理事会会议（扩大）上的发言（摘要）
    茅盾
    新人的不断涌现，年青一代的迅速成长，是我们优越的社会制度的一个重要特征。在文学战线上也和其它战线上一样，大批的新生力量已经涌进我们的作家队伍里来了。例如，这次编选的两年来的文学作品选集，入选的作品绝大部分是新出现的青年作者写的。另一套“青年文学创作选集”，入选作品的作者共188人，他们全部是近年来开始从事写作的。另据统计，各地文艺期刊编辑部收到的投稿，最多的平均每月在千件以上，最少的也有四、五百件。这样大量的投稿者，70％以上是工厂、农村、部队、学校、机关的业余写作者。经我们初步调查，建国以来，持续在各种期刊和报纸上发表作品，有一定写作水平的青年写作者在千人以上，其中半数是比较优秀的，许多是有才能的。
    我国文学的新的一代的潜在力量是很雄厚的。这些新的作者，给我们的文学带来了新的声音，注入了新的血液。他们的共同的特色，是对新鲜事物具有敏锐的感觉，对生活和斗争怀着充沛的热情。他们不愧为我们文学事业中的生力军。
    可是，这种状况，并不能使我们自满自足起来。即使把老一代的作家和青年作家加起来，我们的文学队伍也还是太小。中国作家协会只有五百多个会员，加上这批新的作者，不过只有一千多个人。我们的队伍所以这样小，是跟我们工作中的弱点和错误有着密切的关系的。就是这些已经表现出文学才能的作者，也还有缺陷，他们的作品明显地表现出：对生活的理解不深，缺乏独创性和独特的风格，有许多作品留有模仿的痕迹，还不能熟练地运用语言，艺术的表现力不强等等。在他们当中，有些人还沾染着相当浓厚的资产阶级个人主义思想，他们对文学事业缺乏正确的认识，把创作看成达到个人名利的手段，或者刚发表了几篇文章，就自命不凡、骄傲自满、脱离群众；而不问政治，轻视学习马克思主义学说的倾向也是相当普遍的。所有这些，都是妨碍青年作者的成长和发展的。而这也正好说明：他们迫切地需要帮助，需要得到政治上和业务上的帮助。
    作家协会在培养青年作家这个工作中的基本缺点，是领导落后于群众、认识落后于实际。长时期间，我们对于青年作者的力量估计不足，因此没有认真地进行培养青年作者的工作。相反地，在作协的工作中，以及在作协所领导的有些刊物中，却经常对新生力量采取了贵族老爷式的冷淡或打击的态度。作家协会在发展会员这个工作上，也存在着相当严重的关门主义倾向。在最近主席团批准一批入会的会员以前，作家协会会员中，二十岁到三十岁的只占3.7％。可以看出，青年作者在会员中所占的比例是很小的。
    应该说，不少文艺刊物的编辑部在培养青年作家的工作上是有成绩的，其中比较显著的，是“长江文艺”编辑部，在他们的帮助和鼓励下，出现了不少比较优秀的青年作者。此外，“剧本”和“天津日报文艺周刊”，这方面的工作也作得较好。但是，整个说来，这个工作还是有很大缺点的。
    有一个时期曾经相当盛行的粗暴的文艺批评，也严重地打击了青年作者的创作积极性。近年来，这种粗暴的批评是比较少了，但是，真正热情地科学地分析青年作家作品的有益的评论，还是很少见到。
    作家协会一直没有很好地动员、组织、督促老作家来作培养青年作家的工作。老作家的任务，不但是自己创作，而且要努力培养文学的接班人，这是与进行创作同等重要的社会职责。高尔基和鲁迅是我们的最好的榜样，他们就像慈母一样用自己的奶汁哺育了青年一代的作家。我们中间有些作家是很好地学习了高尔基、鲁迅的这种精神的，但有不少作家还对这项工作缺乏热情，他们把帮助青年作家看成额外的负担。
    和上述主要的缺点和错误并存的，还有另一方面的缺点和错误。作家协会办了一个文学讲习所，这个讲习所曾经招收并毕业了三班学员，它在培养青年作家方面，是做了一些工作，取得了一定的成绩的。但是，由于讲习所的前身、中央文学研究所的某些领导人员的错误的思想作风，在学员中间，散播了一种腐朽的资产阶级思想，他们离开文学的党性原则，而提倡所谓“一本书主义”，鼓励青年作者以取得个人的名誉地位，取得个人的“不朽”为创作（一本书）的目的；他们公然提倡个人崇拜；公然提倡骄傲。在这种思想的影响下，文学讲习所的不少学员中滋长了个人主义的思想，产生了脱离政治的倾向。作家协会主席团对于这种现象也没有能及早地加以检查和纠正。
    此外，在帮助青年作者的工作中，还存在着拔苗助长或包办代替的不良倾向。对于刚刚发表过一两篇作品的青年，有时给了过分的揄扬，而不是在肯定他们的成就的同时指出他们的缺点，向他们提出严格的要求。使一些青年作者冲昏头脑，骄傲自满。有时又过于急躁地希望业余的青年作者成为专业作家，因而把他们过早地从原来的工作中调了出来，这样就使原来生气勃勃的新苗日渐枯萎。我们的某些报刊编辑部，常常用包办代替的方法，将青年作者的原稿彻底地加以改写发表。
    彻底克服我们工作中的缺点和错误，充分运用我们已有的经验，积极地帮助青年作者，更迅速地、更大量地培养出我们文学的生力军，这就是我们作家协会和全体作家的迫切的任务。
    实现这一任务的关键就是要反对保守主义，反对对青年作者估计不足的倾向，反对对待新生力量的贵族老爷式的态度。
    我们要对青年作者进行全面的帮助，这就是要从政治上、思想上、工作上、生活上关怀和帮助他们。青年写作者首先必须是社会上的先进分子，社会主义的积极战士。必须防止他们脱离政治、脱离生活的倾向，要使他们一开始写作就明白，文学事业是人民的事业，创作劳动是一种严肃的艰苦的劳动。我们这个时代的作家只能为人民而工作。只有经常向生活学习，努力掌握马克思列宁主义这个武器，才能与时代和生活的步调一致，才能成为这个时代的先进的作家。
    作家需要深入地熟悉他所写的生活，同时也需要有广博的生活知识。就青年作者而言，首先应当就他所熟悉的生活长期地深入下去，了解这种生活里的一切（就是建立生活根据地），同时，通过阅读书籍、报刊、听报告等等间接方法以丰富他的生活知识。
    本位工作和业余写作如何很好地结合，是一个带有普遍性而且必须解决的问题。一个优秀的业余青年作者应当同时也是积极完成工作任务的优秀的工作人员。但也不能不指出，有些单位的领导者对于青年业余作者的态度是不正确的；他们不分皂白，把业余写作一律看为不安心工作，一律扣上名利观点的帽子，对业余写作的青年不是采取教育、帮助、鼓励的方式，而是加以嘲笑、加以歧视、加以打击。我们号召有志于业余写作的青年应当尊重本单位的领导，积极完成工作任务，同时我们也要求各单位领导者对于业余写作的青年要加以爱护和教育，积极地帮助他们成为既是积极的工作者又是坚持不懈的业余写作者。我们还要郑重地告诉业余写作的青年：积极完成本位工作任务和坚持业余写作，二者之间不但没有矛盾而且可以很好地结合起来。问题在于他的创作态度是怎样的。一个业余青年作者的创作态度如果是从实际出发、实事求是的，也就是说，他在计划写作的时候，如果从自己最熟悉的生活汲取题材，并且按照自己的写作经验来筹划作品的规模的，那么，他将不但不会感到本位工作和业余写作之间的矛盾，而且将体会到，对于本位工作愈积极愈深入，则题材的来源也愈丰富，看问题也将愈明确而深刻，因而他的写作也就能够逐步提高。那些大声诉苦、抱怨他的本位工作“妨害”了他的业余写作，或者是“束缚”了他的文学“天才”的青年，甚至还未写出过一篇作品，就到处写信，引用宪法条文，要求调离工作，让他专门写作的青年，我们认为是不切实际，好高鹜远的。
    许多青年作者不了解一个作家需要有高度的文艺素养和文化素养。他们对于学习文艺理论和古典文学，存在着不正确的看法；对于各种科学文化知识，也很不注意。他们错误地以为只有文艺批评家才需要理论知识，创作家是不需要的；而不知文艺理论既是指导创作的武器，作家也就有必要学习文艺理论。对于古典文学的不正确的看法，产生了学习上的许多偏差。一种是轻视古典文学，以为没有什么可以学习，另一种是把古典文学当作“窍门书”。学习古典作家的艺术技巧，自然是应该的，但是不应当把古典文学的高度艺术性简单化为可以随便搬用的“窍门”。青年作者还应该具有必需的科学和文化知识，应该努力使自己成为一个有高度修养的人。
    我们应当采取什么方法，通过什么步骤来进行培养青年作者的工作呢？（一）在各个中等以上的城市中建立文学小组，使广大的青年文学爱好者的文学学习能够有组织地有领导地去进行。（二）改进文学讲习所的工作，举办短期训练班，以便更广泛地训练青年作者，同时准备条件，创办正规的文学院。各大、中城市有条件时可举办文学讲座。通过各种方式，有计划、有重点地进行对青年作者的辅导工作。（三）每隔一两年召开一次青年文学创作会议，讨论青年作者的作品，交流创作经验，给青年作者解答创作中的各种问题。每年将青年作家的优秀作品编成选集出版。（四）组织、动员、督促作家从事具体帮助青年作家的工作。作家除根据需要采取为青年作者做报告、讲课、参加座谈会等方式进行这方面的工作外，特别重要的是与青年作者建立个别联系与个别地进行帮助（即“带徒弟”）。（五）加强作家协会各机关刊物的编辑部，使它们有可能用更大的力量进行培养青年作家的工作。（六）加强对青年作者作品的评论工作。各地文艺领导机关和刊物编辑部应当热情地关心青年的创作，把组织批评和组织讨论做为经常性的工作。（七）培养理论批评工作的新生力量。作家协会及各地方分会应该成立理论批评组，吸收青年批评家参加。各刊物编辑部应该把联系和帮助青年理论批评工作者作为自己的重要任务。（八）作家协会应该配合有关方面组织力量，编写一部简明的汉语文学史和汉语现代文学史以及文艺学的教材。作家协会应该协助有关部门进行中、小学文学教材的编选工作。
    最后，为了使得青年的作品有更多的发表机会，希望各省市日报考虑增设每周一次或三日一次的“文学副刊”作为专供青年作者发表作品的园地。
