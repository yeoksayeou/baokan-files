    Drilling Work at Sanmenxia Dam Site Completed Ahead of Schedule

    The drilling work for the dam site of the Sanmenxia Hydraulic Hub Project was completed in mid-March, more than a month ahead of schedule. The rock cores extracted from the drilling further prove that the rock at the dam site is very suitable for building a huge high dam.

    This drilling work, which provides data for the preliminary design of the project, is an important basis for the project design. This drilling work started in May 1954, and 31 boreholes were drilled by December of the same year, initially revealing the stratum conditions. In order to more accurately grasp the water permeability, crushing situation, and thickness of the rock layer that are decisive for the safety of the dam body, 30 more boreholes were added in September 1955 at the suggestion of Soviet experts. In the drilling work lasting about fifteen months, hundreds of drilling personnel, under the slogan of striving for early construction of the project, worked day and night, endured storms, and drilled a total of 61 boreholes on steep cliffs and in the torrents of the Sanmen Gorge, and in hard rock, with a drilling depth of about 4,000 meters. Currently, technical personnel working indoors are working hard to complete the final data processing and compilation work.

    Now, most of the drilling personnel have transferred to short-term intensive training to meet the drilling tasks of providing technical design data for the project. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 三门峡坝址钻探工作提前完成

    三门峡坝址钻探工作提前完成
    三门峡水力枢纽工程的坝址钻探工作已经在三月中旬提前一个多月完成。钻探取出的岩心进一步证明，坝址的岩石很适合建筑巨大的高坝。
    这种为工程初步设计提供资料的钻探工作，是工程设计的重要依据。这项钻探工作从1954年5月开始，到同年十二月就钻了三十一个钻孔，初步探明了岩层情况。为更正确的掌握对坝身安全有决定性的岩石的透水性、破碎情况，以及岩层的厚度，经苏联专家建议，在1955年9月又增加了三十个钻孔。在先后约十五个月的钻探工作中，几百名钻探人员，在争取工程提前施工的口号下，不分白天黑夜，经受狂风暴雨，在峭壁悬崖，和三门天险的激流中，在坚硬的岩石上，共钻了六十一个钻孔，钻进深度约有四千公尺。目前，在室内作业的技术人员正在紧张地进行最后的资料整理和汇编工作。
    现在，大部分的钻探人员都转入短期的集训，以迎接为工程提供技术设计资料的钻探任务。　　　　　　　　　　　　　（新华社）
