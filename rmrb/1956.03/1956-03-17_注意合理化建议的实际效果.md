    Pay Attention to the Practical Effect of Rationalization Proposals
    Ji Yin
    In the socialist competition, the workers of the state-owned Shanghai Cigarette Factory No. 1 put forward many rationalization proposals. In the 10 days of February alone, they put forward 1,107 proposals. However, a large proportion of these proposals did not revolve around production requirements, and some had virtually nothing to do with production. The reason for this situation is that the factory adopted the method of "challenge, challenge, and challenge again" to encourage everyone to put forward more rationalization proposals. After worker Gong Changgui put forward the guarantee condition of proposing 10 rationalization proposals, another worker, Lu Zongkui, challenged him, proposing to put forward two more proposals than him. As a result, Gong Changgui revised his own guarantee conditions, guaranteeing to increase the number of rationalization proposals to 14. The third workshop of this factory said in a letter to suburban farmers: "We have now put forward 175 rationalization proposals and guarantee to complete 200 in February."
    Workers' proposals for rationalization should be encouraged, but the leadership's call for and concrete numerical plans, listing the number of rationalization proposals as a guarantee condition for competition, mutual challenges, etc., will inevitably produce or encourage formalism tendencies, causing everyone to simply pursue quantity, making rationalization proposals depart from the needs of production, losing its seriousness, and will cause difficulties for administrative leadership in handling these rationalization proposals. Some comrades are intoxicated with the straight-line increase in the number of rationalization proposals, naively thinking that this can inspire the masses' enthusiasm for competition, but in reality, because these proposals lack practical effect and cannot be realized in production, it will ultimately damage the enthusiasm of the masses and affect the development of the competition.
    Enthusiastically and actively supporting rationalization proposals, and guiding them purposefully to improve production, rather than pursuing quantity freely, is the correct attitude of the leadership of industrial and mining enterprises towards rationalization proposal work, and this can truly inspire the enthusiasm of the workers.

    注意合理化建议的实际效果
    季音
    国营上海卷烟一厂职工在社会主义竞赛中，提出了很多合理化建议，在2月份的10天中，就提出了1，107件。但是这些建议有很大部分没有围绕生产上的要求，有些跟生产简直没有什么关系。发生这种情况的原因是这个工厂采用了“挑战、挑战、再挑战”的办法，来号召大家多提合理化建议，工人龚昌贵提出要提10条合理化建议的保证条件以后，另一个工人陆宗魁就提出挑战，比他多提两条建议，于是，龚昌贵就修改自己的保证条件，保证把合理化建议的件数增加为14条。这个工厂第三车间在给郊区农民写信的时候说：“现在已经提出合理化建议175条，保证在2月份完成200条。”
    职工群众提合理化建议是应当给予鼓励的，但是领导上提出号召和具体数字计划，把提多少条合理化建议列为竞赛的保证条件，相互挑战应战等等，这种做法必然会产生或助长形式主义倾向，使大家去单纯追求数量，使合理化建议离开了生产的需要，失去了它的严肃性，并且会使行政领导上在处理这些合理化建议的时候发生困难。有些同志陶醉于合理化建议数字的直线上升，天真地以为这样可以鼓舞群众的竞赛热情，但是实际上由于这些建议缺乏实际效果，不可能在生产中实现，最终反而会损伤了群众的积极性，影响到竞赛的开展。
    热情地积极地支持合理化建议，并且把它有目的地引导到改进生产上去，而不是自流地追求数量，这才是工矿企业领导上对待合理化建议工作的正确态度，这才能真正地鼓舞起职工群众的积极性。
