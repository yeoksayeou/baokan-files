    Workers in Japan Hold a Rally to Protect Their Livelihoods
    Fifty national trade union organizations, currently engaged in struggles to demand wage increases, sponsored the "National General Mobilization Rally to Protect Livelihoods" in Tokyo on the 15th.
    Iwai Akira, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), pointed out at the rally that the second and third wage increase struggles launched by Japanese workers since February had struck a blow to the government and monopoly capitalists. Iwai then stated that coal mine capitalists had jointly announced on the 14th that they would close mines nationwide. Iwai announced that the Japan Coal Miners' Union had decided to implement an indefinite partial strike. He emphasized that the success of this national workers' spring joint struggle was directly related to the coal miners' struggle and called on workers and people across the country to fully support the coal miners' struggle and continue to carry out the fourth and fifth joint struggles.
    The rally decided to adhere to the current national policy of jointly demanding wage increases. The rally also unanimously passed nine resolutions against malicious revisions to the constitution and rearmament, and against fascist-style control of speech.
    Over 1 Million British Workers Fight for Wage Increases
    British workers continue to fight for wage increases. After negotiations between representatives of 250,000 dockworkers and employers, the employers have agreed to increase workers' wages by an average of 11 shillings per week. Representatives of 1 million construction workers and 600,000 agricultural workers also began negotiations with employers on the 7th regarding wage issues.
    Strike Movement in Italy Continues to Strengthen
    The strike movement in many provinces of Italy continues to strengthen. On March 5th, workers in 22 metallurgical factories in Milan went on strike demanding wage increases and improved working conditions. Workers at the Bonferrio machine factory in Milan finally achieved their goal of increasing wages after a 12-day strike.
    Workers at the "Litopone" chemical factory of the "Montecatini" concern in Livorno have repeatedly stopped work recently because the administration has carried out a series of illegal persecutions against the factory committee (an organization elected by the working people of the enterprise).
    General Strike in Finland
    The national general strike of Finnish workers, which began on March 1st, is still ongoing. Prior to the strike, the Central Federation of Finnish Trade Unions and the Central Association of Employers had held lengthy negotiations to discuss the issue of wage increases caused by rising prices and increased payments, but no results were achieved. On the 12th, the Central Federation of Finnish Trade Unions rejected a "compromise" proposal put forward by the Finnish government arbitration committee.
    The general strike has brought railway transportation, air transport, and maritime transport to a complete standstill in the Finnish capital and throughout the country. In some areas, employers have attempted to use strike-breakers to resume work, but these attempts have also been thwarted.
    Antti Aaltonen, Chairman of the Central Federation of Finnish Trade Unions, delivered a speech at a workers' rally attended by tens of thousands of people in Tampere on March 11th. He pointed out that the Finnish general strike has been going on, and the ranks of strike participants remain united and solid.

    资本主义国家工人争取生活权利的斗争
    日本工人举行保卫生活大会
    为了要求提高工资正在进行斗争的50个全国性工会组织15日在东京主办了“保卫生活国民总决起大会”。
    日本工会总评议会事务局长岩井章在大会上指出：从2月以来，日本工人展开的第二次和第三次要求增加工资的斗争，打击了政府和垄断资本家。岩井接着说：煤矿资本家竟在14日联合声称要在全国封闭矿井。岩井宣布，日本煤矿工会已经决定要实行无限期的部分罢工。他强调这次全国工人春季联合斗争的能否获得胜利同煤矿工人斗争有直接关系，并且号召全国工人和全国人民全力支持煤矿工人的斗争，继续开展第四次和第五次的联合斗争。
    大会决定坚持现在的全国要求提高工资联合斗争的方针。大会还一致通过反对恶劣地修改宪法和重整军备、反对法西斯式的管制言论等九项决议。
    英100多万工人争取提高工资
    英国工人继续为争取提高工资而斗争。25万船坞工人的代表同资方进行谈判后，资方已经答应使工人们的工资每星期平均增加11先令。100万建筑工人和60万农业工人的代表在7日也就工资问题同资方开始谈判。
    意大利罢工运动在继续加强
    意大利许多省的罢工运动在继续加强。3月5日，米兰有22个冶金工厂的工人罢工，要求增加工资和改善劳动条件。米兰邦费里奥机器制造厂的工人在坚持12天的罢工斗争后，终于达到了增加工资的目的。
    里窝那“蒙特卡蒂尼”康采恩的“利托波涅”化学工厂的工人，最近以来不止一次地停止了工作，因为行政当局对工厂委员会（企业劳动人民选出的机构）进行了一系列非法的迫害活动。
    芬兰工人总罢工
    从3月1日开始的芬兰全国工人的总罢工仍在继续进行。在罢工以前，芬兰工会中央联合会与企业主中央协会双方曾经举行过长时期的谈判，讨论由于物价上涨和支付增加而引起的要求提高工资的问题，但是没有获得结果。芬兰工会中央联合会在12日拒绝了芬兰政府仲裁委员会提出的一项“折衷”建议。
    这次总罢工使得芬兰首都和全国各地的铁路交通、空运和海运完全停顿。在某些地区，企业主曾经打算利用工贼来恢复工作，可是，这种企图也遭到了失败。
    芬兰工会中央联合会主席安蒂开连3月11日在坦培累举行的有好几万人参加的工人大会上发表了演说。他指出，芬兰总罢工一直在进行，罢工参加者的阵线仍然是统一而团结的。
