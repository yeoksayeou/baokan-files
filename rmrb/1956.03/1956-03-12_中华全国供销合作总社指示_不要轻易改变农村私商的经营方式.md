Xinhua News Agency, 10th. The All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives recently issued instructions on several issues that should be noted in the current socialist transformation of rural private commerce. The instructions stated that the important issues at present are how to effectively carry out the transformation of rural private commerce, improve commodity circulation, and facilitate the purchasing and sales needs of farmers.

The instructions stated that by early February, approximately 55% of rural private merchants nationwide had been incorporated into socialist transformation organizational forms such as cooperative stores, joint ventures, agency purchasing and sales, and distribution. Among these rural private merchants who have been incorporated into various forms of transformation, many have good business methods and service methods. To a certain extent, they still adapt to commodity circulation and the purchasing and sales needs of the vast rural areas, and are suitable for the habits of farmers and welcomed by farmers. Therefore, within a few months after rural private merchants are incorporated into various forms of transformation, their original management methods, including purchasing relationships, sales systems, accounting, wage systems, and flexible and thoughtful service methods, should not be easily changed. Their advantages in business services should be maintained and promoted. Those business service methods that need to be changed should be carefully studied and their details clarified before being gradually resolved with leadership and planning.

The instructions stated: In order to adapt to the characteristics of decentralized operations in rural areas, the organizational forms of transformation should be diverse. Adopting agency purchasing and sales and distribution forms for small vendors who are scattered in rural areas and frequently travel to villages to sell small commodities, and allowing them to operate some small commodities that supply and marketing cooperatives do not operate, is the best method at present. It also complies with the principle of extending retail networks downward. At present, private shops are generally not merged or relocated. The original scattered shops in rural areas can basically remain unchanged, so as not to affect commodity circulation and farmers' purchasing and sales.

The instructions pointed out: For merchants who have been approved to be transformed through joint ventures and cooperative stores (restaurants), it is necessary to quickly and conscientiously carry out the work of clearing assets and verifying capital in accordance with the principles of fairness, reasonableness, seeking truth from facts, and being lenient rather than strict. The scope of clearing assets and verifying capital should be the fixed and circulating capital originally invested in commodity circulation. At the same time, in the transformation work, it is also necessary to pay attention to maintaining the number of commercial personnel adapted to the purchasing and sales needs of residents. In areas where the number of commercial personnel is roughly balanced with social needs, the number of commercial personnel should no longer be reduced; in some areas where there are too many merchants, it should generally be resolved through reasonable adjustments to the commercial network. The practice of forcibly mobilizing private merchants to switch to agriculture regardless of market needs must be corrected.

    中华全国供销合作总社指示
    不要轻易改变农村私商的经营方式
    新华社10日讯　中华全国供销合作总社最近发出了对当前农村私营商业社会主义改造中应注意的若干问题的指示。指示说，当前重要的问题是如何切实做好农村私营商业改造工作，搞好商品流转，便利农民购销需要等问题。
    指示说，到2月上旬为止，全国农村私商已经有55％左右纳入了合作商店、合营、代购代销、经销等社会主义改造的组织形式。这些纳入各种改造形式的农村私商中，有不少经营方式和服务方式是好的，他们在一定程度上还是适应商品流转和广大农村的购销需要的，并且是适合农民的习惯和受到农民的欢迎的。因此，农村私商在纳入各种改造形式后的几个月内，对他们原有的经营管理方式，包括进货关系，销货制度，会计账务，工资制度以及灵活周到的服务方式等，都不要轻易改变，应该保持和发扬他们经营服务中的优点，对那些需要改变的经营服务方式要经过仔细研究摸清底细后，再有领导有计划的逐步加以解决。
    指示中说：为了适应农村分散经营的特点，在改造的组织形式上应该是多种多样的。对分散在农村中经营零星商品经常串乡的小商贩，采取代购代销和经销形式，并允许他们经营一些供销社不经营的零星商品，是当前最好的办法。同时也符合零售网下伸的原则。目前对于私营店铺，一般不作合并和迁移，对农村分散的原有的店铺，可基本上不动，以免影响商品流转和农民的购销。
    指示中指出：对于一经批准通过合营、合作商店（饭店）形式改造的商户，要迅速本着公平合理、实事求是，宜宽不宜严的原则作好清产核资工作。清产核资的范围，应该是原来投入商品流转的固定与流动资金。同时在改造工作中，还必需注意保持与居民购销需要相适应的商业人员的数量，凡是目前商业人员的数量与社会需要大致平衡的地区，不应再减少商业人员；在有些商人过于集中的地区，一般应通过商业网的合理调整加以解决。那种不顾市场需要，硬性动员私商转入农业的作法，必须加以纠正。
