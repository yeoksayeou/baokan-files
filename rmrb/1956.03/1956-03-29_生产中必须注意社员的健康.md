    Attention Must Be Paid to Members' Health in Production
    Jian Hong
    During the upsurge of agricultural production, some agricultural cooperatives excessively increased the labor intensity of their members and adopted too many crash work methods, which affected the health of some members, especially female members.
    The staff of the Biao Ling Township Agricultural Cooperative in Gaocheng County, Hebei Province, required members to rush to accumulate fertilizer day and night. Some agricultural cooperatives in Boye, Quyang, Xushui and other counties made their members work twenty hours a day. Some cooperatives did not properly divide labor according to the different labor conditions of their members, and assigned heavy work to the elderly or women; they even allowed pregnant women to pull carts to deliver manure in the dark.
    After the realization of agricultural cooperativization, especially the realization of complete socialist agricultural cooperativization, the enthusiasm of the members for labor is very high because the principle of distribution according to work can be fully realized. Precisely because of this, agricultural cooperatives must arrange appropriate work for all kinds of members, so that each member can give full play to their labor enthusiasm without harming their health. Now the spring ploughing has begun, and some urgent work needs to be rushed. However, we must not disregard the health of the members because of this. Strong labor is the source of increased production. Harming the health of the members will not only affect the fundamental interests of the members themselves, but also affect the collective interests of the cooperative. Therefore, agricultural cooperatives in various places must pay attention to organizing labor rationally. Women and the elderly must not be required to do the same as young and strong male members; for those particularly active members who excessively increase their labor intensity, on the one hand, their enthusiasm should be praised, and on the other hand, they should be persuaded to pay attention to proper rest. Only in this way can the members' lasting production enthusiasm be maintained.

    生产中必须注意社员的健康
    剑虹
    在农业生产高潮中，有些农业合作社过分提高社员的劳动强度和过多采取突击的办法，使一些社员特别是女社员的健康受到了影响。
    河北省藁城县表灵乡农业合作社的工作人员，要求社员不分昼夜地突击积肥。博野、曲阳、徐水等县有些农业合作社，让社员每天劳动二十个钟头。有些合作社没有按照社员不同的劳动条件适当分工，把重活也分配给老年人或妇女；竟让孕妇在黑夜拉大车送粪。
    在实现农业合作化特别是实现完全社会主义的农业合作化以后，因为能够充分实现多劳多得的分配原则，社员的劳动积极性很高。正因为这样，农业合作社必须给各种社员安排适当的工作，使每个社员既能发挥劳动积极性，又不致损害身体健康。现在春耕已经开始了，有些紧迫的工作需要进行突击。但是，也决不能因此就不顾社员的身体健康。强壮的劳动力是增加生产的源泉，损害了社员的健康，不但会影响社员个人的根本利益，同时也会影响合作社的集体利益。因此，各地农业合作社必须注意合理地组织劳动。对于妇女和老人，决不能和年轻力壮的男社员一样要求；对于那些特别积极过分加强劳动强度的社员，一方面要表扬他们的积极性，另方面也要说服他们注意适当休息。只有这样，才能保持社员持久的生产积极性。
