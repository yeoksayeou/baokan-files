    Diverting the Yongding River's Water into Beijing
    Over 20,000 in the Capital Participate in Voluntary Labor
    (Our dispatch) On the 11th, over 25,000 workers, cadres, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, young students, Young Pioneers, and others in the capital participated in voluntary labor for the Yongding River water diversion project.
    On this day, a total of over 16,000 cubic meters of earthwork was completed, saving the state more than 10,000 yuan. The amount completed by each person mostly exceeded the original quota.
    In addition, over 3,500 people from 22 middle schools collected approximately 10,000 jin of locust seeds in 15 streets and 3 parks in Beijing. In order to build a more beautiful capital, future voluntary labor will become a larger-scale mass movement.
