Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 25th: According to the German News Agency, Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, delivered a report on "The Second Five-Year Plan and the Socialist Construction of the German Democratic Republic" at the Third Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany on March 24th.

    Ulbricht first spoke about the changing balance of world power and the possibility of consolidating peace. He explained the new factors in the international situation: socialism has become a world system, and the forces of capitalism cannot stop this process.

    Ulbricht said that because the German Democratic Republic has achieved significant successes in building socialism, it has become a solid part of the socialist camp and can no longer be separated from the development of the entire socialist camp. This fact is an important guarantee for the achievements of the German Democratic Republic.

    In explaining the efforts made by the German Democratic Republic in easing European tensions and promoting the all-German people's movement for consolidating peace, Ulbricht spoke about the rapprochement between the Socialist Unity Party and the West German Social Democratic Party. He said that the German Socialist Unity Party is prepared to negotiate with the Social Democratic Party at any time and to cooperate in the struggle against re-militarization and fascism and for peace, democracy, and reunification.

    Ulbricht then pointed out that the current situation in West Germany is characterized by the simultaneous appearance of political and economic crises. He said: "In the struggle between the two systems in Germany, we not only advocate peaceful competition but also reconciliation and cooperation."

    Regarding the significant achievements made by the German Democratic Republic during the first five-year plan (1951-1955), Ulbricht said that the goal of increasing industrial output by 90% as stipulated by the 10th Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (note: held in July 1950) has been generally achieved. Ulbricht pointed out the development of the German Democratic Republic as a bastion of peace; pointed out the fact that the working class has learned to lead the state and the economy; pointed out that industry is not only able to compete in the world market but has also developed Leipzig into a trade center between East and West.

    Ulbricht then spoke about the main tasks of the second five-year plan (1956-1960).

    The total industrial output should increase by more than 55%, and the output of the raw materials industry and the machine manufacturing industry should increase by more than 60%. The output of the consumer goods industry will increase by about 40%.

    Labor productivity must be increased by at least 50%, and production costs reduced by more than 20%.

    Ulbricht pointed out that in agriculture, during the current period of transition to socialism, different forms and methods than those adopted by Poland or Romania have been used. The German Democratic Republic has not declared a struggle against large farmers and has pointed out that all farmers have a future. Large farmers who are willing to cooperate with us have the possibility of becoming members of agricultural production cooperatives.

    Regarding the issue of the middle class, Ulbricht said that the state is giving private entrepreneurs the possibility of greatly increasing production with the participation of state capital. He also said that the desire to safeguard peace and economic progress, the connection between the German Democratic Republic and socialist countries and the powerful peace camp, unites all patriotic Germans with the worker-peasant regime.

    In the second five-year plan, Ulbricht said, two nuclear research institutes will be completed by the end of this year. During the plan period, work will begin on an atomic energy plant. In the near future, the first transport aircraft manufactured in the German Democratic Republic will undergo test flights. Modern transport aircraft with turboprop and jet engines are currently being developed, with the aim of establishing rapid transportation between the German Democratic Republic and Moscow, as well as with China and other countries.

    In agriculture, total production will increase by 21.4%, and 80% of agricultural work will be mechanized.

    Ulbricht emphasized that foreign trade is expected to increase by 70%, with a focus on trade with socialist countries; trade with anti-imperialist countries such as India and Egypt will steadily increase.

    Ulbricht proposed that a seven-hour workday be implemented during the second five-year plan, and a forty-hour workweek in certain industrial sectors, without reducing wages. Working hours will first be shortened in factories where work is harmful to health and in factories where the majority of workers are women.

    在德国统一社会党第三次代表会议上
    乌布利希就五年计划等问题作报告
    据新华社柏林25日电　据德意志通讯社讯：德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希三月二十四日在德国统一社会党第三次代表会议上做了关于“第二个五年计划和德意志民主共和国社会主义的建设”的报告。
    乌布利希首先谈到了世界力量对比的改变和巩固和平的可能性问题。他阐明了国际局势中的新因素：社会主义已经成为一个世界体系，资本主义势力阻挡不了这个进程。
    乌布利希说，由于德意志民主共和国在建设社会主义方面获得了重大的成就，它已经成为社会主义阵营牢靠的一部分，并且不能够再把它和整个社会主义阵营的发展分隔开。这个事实，是德意志民主共和国取得成就的一个重要保证。
    在说明德意志民主共和国在缓和欧洲紧张局势和促进全德人民巩固和平运动方面所做的努力时，乌布利希谈到了统一社会党和西德社会民主党之间的接近问题。他说，德国统一社会党准备在任何时候同社会民主党进行谈判和在反对重新军国主义化和法西斯化、争取和平、民主和重新统一的斗争中进行合作。
    乌布利希接着指出，目前西德局势的特点是：政治危机和经济危机的征象一齐出现。他说：“在德国的两种制度之间的斗争中，我们不仅主张和平竞赛，而且还主张达成和解和进行合作。”
    关于德意志民主共和国在第一个五年计划（1951—1955年）期间所取得的重大成就，乌布利希说，德国统一社会党第十次代表大会（按：是在1950年7月间举行的），所规定的增加工业产量90％的目标，总的说来已经实现了。乌布利希指出了德意志民主共和国作为一个和平堡垒的发展；指出了工人阶级已经学会领导国家和经济这个事实；指出了工业不仅能够在世界市场上竞争，而且已经把来比锡发展成为东西方之间的一个贸易中心。
    乌布利希接着谈到了第二个五年计划（1956—1960）的主要任务。
    工业总产量应该增加55％以上，原料工业和机器制造业的产量增加60％以上。消费品工业的产量约增加40％。
    劳动生产率必须至少提高50％，生产成本降低20％以上。
    乌布利希指出：在农业方面，在现在向社会主义过渡的时期，已经运用了不同于像波兰或罗马尼亚所采取的那种形式和方法。德意志民主共和国没有宣布对大农进行斗争，而且指出了所有的农民都有前途。愿意和我们合作的大农都有可能成为农业生产合作社的社员。
    关于中产阶级问题，乌布利希说，国家给予私营企业家以在国家资本的参加下大大增加生产的可能性。他又说，保障和平和经济进步的愿望、德意志民主共和国同社会主义国家和强大的和平阵营的联系，把所有有爱国主义思想的德国人同工农政权团结起来了。
    在第二个五年计划中，乌布利希说，两个核子研究所将在今年年底建成。在计划期间，将开始原子能工厂的工作。在最近将来，德意志民主共和国制造的第一架运输机将进行试飞。现在正在发展螺旋桨涡轮和喷气引擎的现代运输机，目的是建立德意志民主共和国和莫斯科，以及和中国与其他国家之间的迅速运输。
    在农业方面，全部生产将增加21.4％，农业工作的80％将机械化。
    乌布利希强调指出，对外贸易预计可以增加70％，重点是在同社会主义国家的贸易方面；同印度、埃及这类反帝国主义的国家的贸易将稳步增加。
    乌布利希提议：在第二个五年计划期间实行每天七小时工作制，并且在某些工业部门中实行每周四十小时工作制，而不减低工资。将首先在那些工作有损健康的工厂里和大部分是女工的工厂里缩短工作时间。
