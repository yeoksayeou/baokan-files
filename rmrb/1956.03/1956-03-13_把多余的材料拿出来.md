    Take Out the Surplus Materials
    Kong Sang
    Many industrial and mining enterprises, when discussing the national plan, have broken through the state's production targets. This has created a very acute problem: a shortage of raw materials.
    In order to overcome the difficulty of insufficient raw materials, it is necessary for the departments producing raw materials to work hard to increase production, and for the user departments to strive to conserve raw materials and research and find substitutes. However, in addition to these methods, there is an even more readily available and more immediately helpful solution. This is: to search our existing inventory and dig out the accumulated materials. If one unit does not need them for the time being, they should be transferred to another unit. If one unit has a surplus, it should be transferred to this unit. In this way, everyone can get some urgently needed items in time and jointly accelerate the speed of production growth.
    However, there are now some units that hold the narrow-mindedness of old-fashioned farmers. On the one hand, they desperately ask the higher authorities for more, thinking that the more raw materials are stored, the better. On the other hand, they are unwilling to take out their current surplus and unnecessary items and transfer them to fraternal enterprises. The Dalian Locomotive Factory has more than 400 tons of surplus thin steel plates, but it is unwilling to take them out.
    The comrades in these units may think that their subjective motives are good: "I am also doing it to increase production! If I don't save more reserves, wouldn't I be passive when the output increases in the future?" These comrades always forget that they are not individual farmers running their own business, but a cell in the entire socialist economic system. The property he is responsible for keeping and managing belongs to the entire country. He should have the vision to look at his own enterprise from the perspective of the entire national economy, and should not only see the piece of land under his nose. He should think for the country: the country is short of this kind of thing, if I ask for too much, and I lay an ambush, wouldn't other enterprises have to reduce production? Wouldn't the growth rate of the entire country's industry be affected?
    If every enterprise and every individual considers this aspect when dealing with problems, many problems can be easily solved. Specifically, if everyone considers the overall situation, applies rationally, and actively obeys the transfer, the current difficulty of lacking materials can be greatly alleviated. We must oppose departmentalism and local viewpoints at all times, and of course, the same is true in material work!

    把多余的材料拿出来
    孔桑
    很多工矿企业在讨论国家计划的时候，纷纷突破了国家的生产指标。这就出现了一个非常尖锐的问题：原材料不够。
    为了克服原材料不足的困难，就需要生产原材料的部门努力增加生产，需要使用部门努力节约原材料，研究和寻找代用品。但是，除了这些办法以外，还有一个更现成、更能解救燃眉之急的办法。这就是：搜查我们现有的家底，把积压的材料翻出来，这个单位暂时用不着的，先调给那个单位，那个单位有多余的，调给这个单位，这样，大家就都可以及时得到一些急需的东西，共同加快生产增长的速度。
    但是，现在有一些单位抱着旧式农民的狭隘胸襟，一方面拼命向上级多要，想着原材料存得越多越好；一方面又不肯把自己现在多余的、用不着的东西拿出来，调给兄弟企业。大连机车厂就有400吨多余的薄钢板，不肯拿出来。
    这些单位的同志也许以为自己的主观动机是好的：“我也是为了增加生产啊！如果不多保存些后备，将来产量提高了岂不被动？”这些同志总是忘记了，他现在不是独家独业的个体农民，而是整个社会主义经济系统中的一个细胞。他负责保管和经营的财产，是整个国家的。他应该具有从整个国民经济着眼来看待自己企业的眼光，而不应该只看到鼻子尖底下的一块土地。他应该替国家设想：国家正缺少这种东西，如果我多要了，我打下了埋伏，其他企业岂不要减产？整个国家的工业增长速度岂不是要受到影响？
    如果每一个企业、每一个人处理问题的时候都从这方面着想，许多问题就都可以迎刃而解了。具体地说，如果大家都从全面考虑，合理地申请，积极地服从调拨，目前缺乏材料的困难就可以在很大程度上减轻。本位主义、局部观点，我们在任何时候都要反对，在材料工作上当然也不例外！
