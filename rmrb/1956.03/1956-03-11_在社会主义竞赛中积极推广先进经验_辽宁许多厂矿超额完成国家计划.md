Actively Promote Advanced Experience in Socialist Competition
    Liaoning Many Factories and Mines Exceed National Plans
    More than 1.6 million workers in Liaoning Province have enthusiastically participated in socialist competition. According to statistics from 10 cities including Shenyang up to the end of February, workers have put forward a total of 104,637 rationalization proposals, with over 60,000 workers exceeding various quotas, and a total of 36,448 advanced producers and 2,448 advanced production units emerging.

    The majority of workers throughout the province have learned and promoted many advanced experiences in the socialist competition. Shenyang and other 10 cities have already promoted 1,649 advanced experiences. Anshan Iron and Steel is systematically promoting 219 kinds of advanced experiences such as quick steelmaking, steel rolling, and steam blowing. In January and February, the Iron Smelting Plant created 46 new daily output records on 6 blast furnaces, increasing pig iron production by 18,000 tons. Due to the promotion of advanced experience, many factories and mines exceeded the national plans for January and February. In Shenyang, 67 factories completed an average of 104.4% of their total output value plan for February. In Fushun, state-owned and local state-owned industries comprehensively exceeded the national plans for 20 major products such as raw coal and crude oil.

    The rationalization proposals put forward by the workers have solved many key problems in production. The proposal by Huang Deliang, a technician at Fushun Heavy Machinery Plant, to comprehensively improve the labor organization in the cast iron workshop, has increased the output of this workshop to 4.26 tons, allowing the plant to comprehensively complete the national plan a quarter ahead of schedule.

    In the competition, workers have begun to establish a new trend of advanced workers leading the backward, and backward workers learning from the advanced. According to statistics from 7 factories in Jinzhou, the number of advanced producers has increased from 387 to more than 600. Workers at Benxi Coal Mine and Iron Mine have launched a wave of learning from advanced coal miner Wang Hengcheng and advanced ore miner Li Qingzhen. In Nanfen Iron Mine, 40% of the workers have mastered Li Qingzhen's advanced mining methods. In Benxi Coal Mine, 35 workers have exceeded Wang Hengcheng's production level.

    在社会主义竞赛中积极推广先进经验
    辽宁许多厂矿超额完成国家计划
    辽宁省已有160多万职工热烈参加社会主义竞赛。据沈阳等10个市到2月底的统计，职工们共提出了104，637件合理化建议，有6万多工人突破了各种定额，共涌现出36，448名先进生产者和2，448个先进生产单位。
    全省大部分职工在社会主义竞赛中学习和推广了许多先进经验。沈阳等10个城市已经推广的先进经验有1，649项。鞍钢正在有计划地推广快速炼钢、轧钢和蒸气鼓风等219种先进经验。炼铁厂在1月和2月份里，在6个高炉上创造了46项日产量新纪录，增产生铁18，000吨。由于先进经验的推广，许多厂矿超额完成了1月和2月份国家计划。沈阳有67个工厂2月份平均完成了总产值计划的104.4％。抚顺市国营和地方国营工业的原煤原油等20种主要产品全面超额完成国家计划。
    职工们提出的合理化建议，解决了许多生产上的关键问题。抚顺重型机器厂技术员黄德良提出的全面改进铸铁车间的劳动组织的建议，使这个车间的产量提高到4.26吨，可以提前一季度全面完成国家计划。
    职工们在竞赛中开始树立了先进带动落后，落后向先进看齐的新风气。据锦州市7个工厂统计，先进生产者由387人增加到600多人。本溪煤矿和铁矿职工掀起学习先进采煤工人王恒成和先进采矿工人李庆振的热潮。南芬铁矿有40％工人掌握了李庆振的先进采矿方法。本溪煤矿有35名工人超过王恒成的生产水平。　（本报驻沈阳记者）
