    Wheat Variety with Higher Yield than "Bima No. 1"
    Zhao Jimin, a technician at the Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Comprehensive Experiment Station, using Michurin's theory, has cultivated a new high-quality wheat variety called "No. 54." After identification, this wheat variety has short, thick and hard stalks, making it less prone to lodging even with heavy fertilization and sufficient water; it grows uniformly, with many flowers and grains, and is resistant to stripe rust and culm black disease. Under the same soil, climate, and other conditions, the yield of "No. 54" wheat is 13.37% higher than that of "Bima No. 1" wheat, which was previously cultivated by Zhao Hongzhang, a professor at Northwest Agricultural College.
    Currently, regional trials of "No. 54" wheat are being conducted on more than 20 mu of land in Xi'an, Chang'an, Jingyang, Dali, and other cities and counties in Shaanxi Province. According to recent inspections, this wheat is growing well and is very popular among the farmers. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    比“碧蚂一号”产量更高的麦种
    陕西省农业综合试验站技师赵济民运用米丘林的学说，培育出一种“五四号”小麦良种。经过鉴定，这种小麦的茎秆矮而粗硬，在粪大水足的情况下不易倒伏；生长整齐，多花多粒，能抵抗条锈病和秆黑病。在同样土壤、气候等条件下，“五四号”小麦的产量比过去西北农学院教授赵洪璋培育的“碧蚂一号”小麦的产量还高13.37％。
    现在陕西省西安、长安、泾阳、大荔等市、县的二十多亩地上，正在进行“五四”号小麦的区域试验。据最近检查，这种小麦生长良好，很受农民群众的欢迎。　（据新华社讯）
