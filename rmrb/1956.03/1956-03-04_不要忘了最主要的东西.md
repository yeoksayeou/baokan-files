    Don't Forget the Most Important Thing
    By Our Reporter Fang Qing
    The Harbin First Construction Company of the Ministry of Heavy Industry's Construction Engineering Bureau (hereinafter referred to as the Civil Engineering Company), the Harbin Metal Structure Company, and the Harbin Mechanical Installation Engineering Company jointly undertook the construction of a factory. Before October 1955, the project progressed very slowly due to mutual buck-passing. After October 1955, everyone examined their departmentalism and strengthened cooperation, and the project progressed rapidly.
    The course of this matter shows that in basic construction work, if the relevant units do not consider the overall interest, then even seemingly small matters will lead to endless disputes. For example, before October, one day, just as the Civil Engineering Company was busy transporting construction materials, the Harbin Mechanical Installation Company blocked a heavy machine at the throat of the transportation road, cutting off traffic. The Civil Engineering Company had long considered that the machine would move slowly, and if it were transported during the day, it would definitely block the road, so it suggested that the Mechanical Installation Company transport it at night. The Mechanical Installation Company, however, believed that night transportation would require installing electric lights, which they were unwilling to do, so they seized an opportunity to block the machinery on the main traffic road, thinking that this would allow them to transport it first. For this matter, both sides held an emergency meeting, and only after the Civil Engineering Company agreed to install electric lights did the Mechanical Installation Company clear the way.
    On another occasion, the Mechanical Installation Company placed a crane in the area where the Civil Engineering Company was about to excavate, delaying the Civil Engineering Company's project by five days.
    The Civil Engineering Company was also responsible for some other problems. For example, the Mechanical Installation Company wanted to build a temporary small railway directly to the factory building for easy transportation. This railway had to pass through the Civil Engineering Company's concrete processing plant, but the Civil Engineering Company did not consider the other party's needs and unloaded a large pile of sand on the railway.
    Continuing like this not only delayed the progress of the project but also hindered the solidarity among the workers. Sometimes, the Civil Engineering Company needed to use a crane to transport some materials, but the Mechanical Installation Company, which was responsible for managing the crane, refused to lend it no matter what. One foreman even hooked his foot on the crane's hook and said, "Just take me away if you want!"
    Similar buck-passing incidents occurred constantly, causing the foundation project of the factory building to be delayed by 54 days. The higher authorities discovered these problems and immediately took organizational measures, stipulating mutual cooperation regulations. After learning about these problems, the local Party committee also immediately sent a work team to convene a meeting of the Party committee secretaries of each company and conduct criticism and self-criticism. When true thoughts met, everyone suddenly realized that they had only been planning for their own units, afraid of suffering losses, and had neglected the most important thing – accelerating socialist construction. When the person in charge of the Mechanical Installation Company reviewed the incident of rushing to transport machinery and seizing the ground to unload the crane, he said, "These things seem to have rushed to the front, and we were 'victorious,' but from the perspective of the entire project, the progress was delayed. The foundation project of the factory building was delayed, and we should bear more responsibility." Talking about the relationship between work processes, he said, "At that time, we only cared about arguing with each other, and we forgot such a simple truth: if the factory buildings on the civil engineering side are not built, our machinery will have nowhere to be installed!"
    After examining their thoughts, they studied Soviet experience and held a meeting of the heads of each company every day to predetermine solutions to all the problems they thought would occur. This system had been established before, initially with the managers of each company attending, then sending section chiefs as proxies, and then sending clerks as proxies. The meetings could not solve the problems and slowly fizzled out. Now, they stipulate that the company heads must attend. In fact, as long as the person in charge takes action personally, there is no problem that cannot be solved. They also set up an inspection team to specifically check the implementation of the resolutions of the coordination meetings. In order to facilitate the resolution of problems that arise temporarily on the construction site, they also established a "system负责人" (system leader) and two assistants in each project unit.
    In terms of systems, a relatively detailed cooperation regulation is mainly used as a blueprint for handling mutual relations. The division of labor for some projects has also been clarified and rationalized. For example, in the past, the beams for installing cranes were made by the Metal Structure Company, while the crane tracks were the responsibility of the Mechanical Installation Company; the window frames were made by the Metal Structure Company, while the windows were the responsibility of the Mechanical Installation Company. In this way, the specifications did not match each other, and there was no way to investigate responsibility. Now, it is stipulated that such things are entirely undertaken by the Metal Structure Company.
    Since October of last year, through the above three methods of cooperation, great results have been achieved, and those disputes mentioned above have been greatly reduced. The decisive experience here is that everyone should not only make small calculations but should forget the most important thing – the overall interests of the country and accelerating the progress of the project.

    不要忘了最主要的东西
    本报记者　方青
    重工业部建筑工程局哈尔滨第一工程公司（以下简称土木建筑公司）和哈尔滨金属结构公司、哈尔滨机械安装工程公司共同承建一座工厂。1955年10月份以前，由于互相扯皮，工程进展很慢。1955年10月以后，大家检查了本位主义思想，加强了协作，工程进展就快起来了。
    这件事情的经过说明，在基本建设工作中，如果有关单位都不考虑整体利益，那末，即使遇到看来是很小的事情，也会争吵不休。例如在10月份以前，有一天，正当土木建筑公司忙于运输建筑器材的时候，哈尔滨机械安装公司却把一台笨重的机器堵在运输道路的咽喉上，把交通断绝了。土木建筑公司早就考虑到这台机器运行很慢，如果白天运输，一定会堵塞道路的，所以提议机械安装公司在夜间运输。机械安装公司则认为夜间运输还得安电灯，不愿费工费电，所以就抽了个空子把机械堵在交通要道上，以为这样就可以抢先运输。为了这件事情，双方开了紧急会议，直到土木建筑公司答应安设电灯以后，机械安装公司才让路。
    又一次，机械安装公司把一架天车放在土木建筑公司正要挖土的地方，使得土木建筑公司的工程推迟了5天。
    在另一些问题上，土木建筑公司也有责任。例如机械安装公司为了便于运输而修一条直通厂房的临时小铁道，这条铁道一定要经过土木建筑公司的混凝土加工场，土木建筑公司也不替对方想想，便把一大堆砂土卸在这条铁道上。
    这样闹下去，不仅推迟了工程进度，而且妨碍了工人之间的团结。有时土木建筑公司需要用天车搬运一些器材，负责管理天车的机械安装公司无论怎么也不肯借。有一位工长甚至把脚勾在天车的弯钩上，说：“要叼就把我叼走吧！”
    类似这些扯皮事情，不断发生，厂房基础工程因而推迟了54天。上级发现了这些问题，马上采取组织措施，规定了互相间的协作规程。地方党委了解到这些问题以后，也立刻派来工作队，召开各公司的党委书记会议，展开批评和自我批评。真正思想见了面，大家才恍然大悟，原来以前只是为本单位打算盘，怕自己吃亏，而忽略了一个主要的东西——加速社会主义建设。机械安装公司负责人检讨抢运机械、抢地盘卸天车的时候，这样说：“这些事看来是抢到前面了，是‘胜利’了，但是从整个工程看，进度却拖迟了。厂房的基础工程推迟了，我们应当多负些责任。”谈到工序关系的时候，他说：“当时只顾彼此闹意见，连这样一个很浅显的道理也忘了：土木建筑方面的厂房建立不起来，我们的机械运来也没处安装呵！”
    检查思想以后，他们就学习苏联经验，每天开一次各公司负责人碰头会，把想到将要发生的一切问题，预先拟出处理办法。这种制度以前也建立过，起先是各公司经理来，后来派科长代理，科长又派科员代理，会议不能解决问题，慢慢就流产了。现在，他们规定一定要公司负责人来。事实上，只要负责人亲自动手，就没有解决不了的问题。他们还设立了一个检查组，专门检查碰头会决议执行的情况。为了便于解决工地上临时发生的问题，又在每一个工程单位设一个“系统负责人”和两个助手。
    在制度上，主要以一个比较详尽的协作规程，作为处理互相关系的蓝本。对一些工程的分工也明确了，合理了。比方过去安设天车的梁是由金属结构公司来作，而天车的轨道则由机械安装公司负责；窗框由金属结构公司来作，而窗子又由机械安装公司负责。这样，彼此间规格不吻合，也没法追查责任。现在规定这类事完全由金属结构公司承做。
    从去年10月以来，通过以上这三种办法进行协作，收到了很大效果，像上述那些纠纷，现在是大大减少了。这里具有决定性的一条经验就是大家不要只打小算盘，忘了最主要的东西——国家整体利益，加速工程进度。
