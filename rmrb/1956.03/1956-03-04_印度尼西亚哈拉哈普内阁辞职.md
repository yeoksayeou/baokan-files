Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 3rd - The Indonesian cabinet has resigned. Prime Minister Harahap and First Deputy Prime Minister Djanu Ismadi returned the cabinet mandate to President Sukarno at the Bogor Palace at 10:00 AM on March 3rd.

After receiving Harahap and Djanu Ismadi, Sukarno told the press that he had accepted the request of the Harahap cabinet to return the mandate. He requested the Harahap cabinet to continue working as a resigned cabinet to handle unfinished matters.

Sukarno said that he would decide whether to establish a caretaker cabinet and immediately appoint a candidate to form a new cabinet after consulting with Vice President Hatta.

The Harahap cabinet held its last meeting on the evening of March 2nd, where it decided to return the mandate to the president and that the newly elected parliament would convene on March 26th. That evening, the cabinet formally notified the Provisional Parliament of its decision to resign.

The Harahap cabinet was formed on August 11th of last year. The Masyumi Party was the main party composing this cabinet. During its tenure, its policies such as appointing the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Air Force, holding negotiations with the Netherlands, and encouraging foreign capital investment were widely opposed by various Indonesian political parties and organizations. Since the preliminary results of the general election held last September were announced, opposition parties and many mass organizations have been demanding the Harahap cabinet resign quickly. Due to disagreements with the Harahap cabinet's foreign policy, the Islamic Teachers Association and the Indonesian Islamic Union Party, which participated in the government, withdrew all their ministers in January of this year. The Indonesian Nationalist Party and four other political parties also formally submitted a motion of no confidence to the parliament on February 17th.

    印度尼西亚哈拉哈普内阁辞职
    新华社雅加达3日电　印度尼西亚内阁已经辞职。总理哈拉哈普和第一副总理贾努伊斯马迪3月3日上午10时在茂物宫把内阁委任状交还苏加诺总统。
    苏加诺在接见哈拉哈普和贾努伊斯马迪之后对报界说，他已经接受了哈拉哈普内阁交还委任状的要求。他要求哈拉哈普内阁作为辞职了的内阁继续工作，处理未了的问题。
    苏加诺说，至于是否要成立看管内阁和立即指定新内阁的组阁人选，他将在同副总统哈达进行磋商之后做出决定。
    哈拉哈普内阁在3月2日晚上举行了最后一次会议，会上决定把委任状交还总统，并且决定新选出的国会将在3月26日开会。当天晚上，内阁把它辞职的决定正式通知临时国会。
    哈拉哈普内阁是在去年8月11日组成的。马斯友美党是组成这个内阁的主要政党。在它执政期间，它的任命空军副参谋长、同荷兰举行谈判以及鼓励外国资本投资等项政策曾遭到印度尼西亚各政党团体的广泛反对。自从去年9月举行的普选初步结果揭晓以后，各反对党和许多群众团体一直在要求哈拉哈普内阁迅速辞职。由于不同意哈拉哈普内阁的外交政策，参加政府的回教师联合会和印度尼西亚回教联盟党在今年1月撤回了所有部长。印度尼西亚国民党等四个政党并且曾在2月17日正式向国会提出不信任案。
