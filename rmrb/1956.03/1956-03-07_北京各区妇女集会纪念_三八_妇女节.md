Xinhua News Agency, March 6th: Various systems at the municipal level and the 14 urban and suburban districts of Beijing held conferences or symposiums today to commemorate International Women's Day.

    At the Beijing Municipal Women Workers and Employees' Family Members Commemorative Meeting for International Women's Day, attended by more than 1,500 people, Luo Shuzhen, Beijing Municipal Industrial Labor Model and female postwoman, represented Beijing's female workers in actively supporting the convocation of the World Women Workers' Conference and expressed her intention to be a locomotive in building socialism. From August 1953 to today, Luo Shuzhen has delivered 729,180 pieces of mail without a single mistake. The 99 female workers who were recognized as municipal labor models last year were commended at the meeting today.

    At the symposium of female workers and agricultural labor models held in the Eastern Suburban District, Zhao Yuqing, female director of an agricultural production cooperative with more than 1,000 households in Dongba Township, stated that she would mobilize all 1,000-plus female laborers in the cooperative to participate in production and strive to complete this year's production increase target of "1,000 jin per mu."

For example, Wang Liwei, a first-class model caregiver at the First Affiliated Kindergarten of the Beijing Early Childhood Normal School, carefully observes the characteristics of children of different ages and personalities, educates them using different methods, and maintains close contact with parents, enabling children to develop more comprehensively in terms of intelligence and character, with lively and lovable personalities.

    In the Dongsi District, more than 1,000 housewives gathered today to celebrate their holiday. Yang Shuzhen, a mother of seven children, shared her experience of overcoming difficulties and persisting in learning culture. Recently, the housewives in Wacha Hutong, where she lives, proposed to housewives throughout the city to eliminate illiteracy within two years.

    北京各区妇女集会纪念“三八”妇女节
    据新华社6日讯  北京市市级各系统和城、郊14个区今天分别召开大会或座谈会，纪念“三八”国际妇女节。
    在1，500多人参加的北京市女职工、职工家属纪念“三八”国际妇女节大会上，北京市工业劳动模范、女邮递员罗淑珍代表北京市女工积极支持世界女工会议的召开，并且表示要做建设社会主义的火车头。罗淑珍从1953年8月到今天已经投递了729，180封邮件，没有出过差错。去年被评为市级劳动模范的99名女工，今天在会上受到了表扬。
    在东郊区召开的女工农业劳动模范座谈会上，东坝乡1，000多户的农业生产合作社女社长赵玉清表示要发动全社1，000多个妇女劳动力参加生产，努力完成今年“千亩千斤”的增产指标。她所领导的农业生产合作社第一大队的妇女，今天向全社6个大队提出了开展增产竞赛的挑战。
    在北京市保育界模范、优秀工作者大会上有327个保育工作者受到了市人民委员会的奖励。这些受奖的人在保育工作方面都发挥了创造性。例如北京幼儿师范第一附属幼儿园一等模范教养员王立威，平时细心观察不同年龄、不同性格孩子的特点，用不同的方法教育他们，并且和家长取得密切联系，使孩子在智力和品质方面发展得都比较全面，性格活泼可爱。
    在东四区，今天有1，000多个家庭主妇集会庆祝自己的节日。7个孩子的妈妈杨淑珍向大家介绍了如何克服困难、坚持学习文化的经验。最近，她所在的瓦岔胡同的家庭主妇们向全市的家庭主妇提出了在两年内扫除文盲的倡议。
