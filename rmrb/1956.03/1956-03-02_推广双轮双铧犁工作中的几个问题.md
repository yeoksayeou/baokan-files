    Several Problems in Promoting the Double-Wheel Two-Share Plow
    Li Jingyu, Director of the Agricultural Machinery Administration Bureau, Ministry of Agriculture
    According to the national plan, 3.5 million double-wheel two (single)-share plows will be produced in 1956, and 2.7 million will be promoted, including 600,000 to 700,000 in the first quarter. Compared with 1955, the number of manufactured plows has increased more than five times, and the number of plows promoted will increase nearly four times. Therefore, it can be seen that the task of completing the manufacturing, supply, promotion, repair, and technical instruction (including usage and maintenance) of double-wheel two (single)-share plows in 1956 is quite arduous. In order to successfully complete and overfulfill this year's promotion plan for double-wheel two (single)-share plows, and to ensure the realization of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), which requires the promotion of 6 million double (single)-share plows within 3 to 5 years, all responsible departments must do the following:
    I. Ensure the manufacturing quality of agricultural implements. In 1955, the plan to promote double-wheel two (single)-share plows was overfulfilled. This was mainly due to the great development of agricultural cooperativization, but also because the manufacturing quality of agricultural implements was relatively good and indeed welcomed by farmers. In 1955, only more than 30 factories nationwide manufactured new-style animal-drawn agricultural implements. In the spring, the central industrial, agricultural, and supply and marketing cooperative departments jointly organized factory-by-factory inspections in rotation, which largely ensured the quality of the agricultural implements leaving the factories. This year, the planned number of double-wheel two (single)-share plows to be promoted is 2.7 million, with more than 1,000 large and small manufacturing factories and cooperative factories. These factories are distributed in almost all parts of the country (only Jiangxi and Qinghai provinces do not have agricultural implement manufacturing factories). Most of these factories are newly built or privately owned; most factories lack technical personnel and equipment, and the manufacturing quantity is large while time is pressing. Therefore, ensuring the manufacturing quality of double-wheel two (single)-share plows, strengthening the inspection of the manufacturing quality of these agricultural implements, and strictly implementing the factory responsibility system are the primary keys to ensuring the smooth development of this year's new-style animal-drawn agricultural implement promotion work. In mid-February, the relevant central departments had already dispatched more than 100 staff members, jointly forming 9 groups, to inspect manufacturing, transportation, repair, and technical instruction, etc. in various places. All provinces should also organize relevant departments to earnestly do a good job in inspecting the manufacturing quality of new-style animal-drawn agricultural implements.
    II. Do a good job in supply and allocation. At present, it is the busy season for preparing for spring plowing, and thousands of agricultural production cooperatives in various places are urgently demanding the purchase of new-style animal-drawn agricultural implements. Agricultural implement factories in various places have also put into intense manufacturing work in order to meet the needs of farmers. Before the end of March, 760,000 double-wheel two (single)-share plows and a batch of other large-scale agricultural implements will be manufactured. Supplying these agricultural implements to farmers before spring plowing is a very urgent task. Therefore, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places must formulate agricultural implement allocation plans, sign pre-sale contracts with farmers as soon as possible, and properly arrange supply work. The specific requirements for doing this work well are: 1. All plows and some other large-scale agricultural implements produced before the end of March must be fully transferred to grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives before April 15. 2. The time for agricultural production cooperatives to allocate new-style agricultural implements through supply and marketing cooperatives should generally not exceed 15 days. It is necessary to achieve direct transportation and avoid roundabout and head-on transportation. 3. Before the start of spring plowing, pre-sales of new-style agricultural implements to farmers must reach more than 90% of the planned number for the first quarter. 4. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places or factories entrusted to handle consignments should submit monthly transportation plans and 5-day consignment plans to the railway department on schedule. Due to the urgency of this task, if the consignment plan must be changed, the railway department should allow requests for wagons outside the plan and exempt fines for non-fulfillment both inside and outside the plan. In addition, highway transportation and waterway transportation departments should also give preferential treatment to the transportation of new-style agricultural implements. Only in this way can new-style agricultural implements be delivered to farmers in a timely manner, so that they can play a role in spring plowing production and achieve the goal of deep plowing and increased production.
    III. Strengthen the technical instruction, repair, and parts supply of new-style agricultural implements. After a large number of new-style animal-drawn agricultural implements are promoted to farmers, helping farmers do a good job in the repair and parts supply of new-style agricultural implements is a very arduous task. If this work does not keep up, the effectiveness of new-style agricultural implements cannot be fully utilized. At present, the number of agricultural implement repair stations in various places is insufficient, the technology is not high, and the supply of parts is not timely, which is far behind the development of promotion work. Therefore, in the future, it must be unified under the responsibility of the handicraft management department, and a large number of agricultural implement repair stations must be built. Larger agricultural production cooperatives should set up agricultural implement repair groups according to needs and possibilities, so that the repair work of new-style agricultural implements can be deepened into the cooperative. For parts supply, it is necessary to grasp the law of deficiency and damage, formulate supply plans, and have factories produce enough varieties of spare parts on a quarterly basis for timely supply.
    Educating farmers to master the use, maintenance, and simple repair techniques of new-style agricultural implements is an important step in promotion work. Agricultural departments in various places must train a group of technical cadres before spring plowing to serve as teachers, and earnestly do a good job in training farmers in agricultural implement skills. In areas where there are already agricultural implement technicians, agricultural implement technical instruction groups should be formed with the township or village as a unit, or agricultural implement technical instruction networks should be organized jointly by various townships and villages, so as to exchange technical experience with each other, and cultivate a large number of new agricultural implement operators through mutual teaching and learning among the masses.

    推广双轮双铧犁工作中的几个问题
    农业部农业机械管理总局局长　李菁玉
    根据国家计划，1956年将生产双轮双（单）铧犁350万部，推广270万部，其中第一季度推广60到70万部。1956年和1955年比较：制造数量增加了五倍多，推广数量增加将近四倍。由此可见，要完成1956年双轮双（单）铧犁的制造、供应、推广、修配一直到技术传授（包括使用和保养）等任务是相当繁重的。为了胜利地完成和超额完成今年双轮双（单）铧犁的推广计划，并且保证实现全国农业发展纲要（草案）所提出的在3年到5年内推广双（单）铧犁600万部的要求，各主管部门必须做好以下几项工作：
    一、保证农具的制造质量。1955年超额地完成了推广双轮双（单）铧犁的计划任务，这主要是由于农业合作化的大发展，但是同时也是由于农具制造质量比较好，确实受到农民欢迎。1955年全国只有30多个工厂制造新式畜力农具，春季又经过中央的工业、农业、供销合作等部门联合组织进行逐厂轮番检查，才大体保证了出厂农具的质量。今年双轮双（单）铧犁计划推广数量为270万部，大、小制造工厂和协作工厂达1，000多处。它们分布的地区差不多遍及全国各地（仅江西、青海两省没有农具制造工厂）。这些工厂大部分是新建的或者是私营的；多数厂技术人员不足，技术设备不全，制造的数量大，时间又很紧迫。因此，保证双轮双（单）铧犁的制造质量，加强对这些农具的制造质量的检查，严格出厂责任制，就是保证今年新式畜力农具推广工作顺利开展的首要关键。中央各有关部门已经在2月中旬抽调了100多工作人员，联合组成9个组，到各地检查制造、运输、修配和技术传授等项工作，各省也应该组织有关部门，认真做好新式畜力农具制造质量的检查工作。
    二、做好供应调拨工作。目前正是准备春耕的紧张季节，各地成千成万的农业生产合作社正迫切要求购置新式畜力农具；各地农具工厂为了满足农民的要求，也都投入了紧张的制造工作，3月底以前将制造出76万部双轮双（单）铧犁和一批其他大型农具。要把这批农具在春耕前供应给农民，这是一件十分紧迫的工作。因此，各地供销合作社必须做好农具调拨计划，及早地同农民签订预售合同，妥善安排供应工作。做好这件工作的具体要求是：1、凡3月底以前生产出来的犁和部分其他大型农具，必需在4月15日前全数调到基层供销合作社。2、经由供销合作社调拨到农业生产合作社的时间一般不得超过15天。切实做到直线运输，避免迂回和相向运输。3、在春耕开始前，预售给农民新式农具必须达到第一季度计划推广数的90％以上。4、各地供销合作社或委托办理托运的工厂，应该向铁路部门按期提出月度运输计划和5日托运计划。由于这一任务的紧迫性急，托运计划如果必须变更时，铁路部门应准许计划外要车，并免除计划外和计划内落空的罚款。此外，公路运输、航道运输部门对新式农具的运输工作也应给以优待。只有这样，才能把新式农具及时地送到农民手中，使它在春耕生产中发挥作用，达到深耕增产的目的。
    三、加强新式农具的技术传授、修配和零件供应工作。大量的新式畜力农具推广到农民手里以后，帮助农民做好新式农具的修配和零件供应工作是一项非常艰巨的任务。这项工作如果赶不上去，就不能充分发挥新式农具的效能。目前各地农具修配站数量不足，技术不高，零件供应不及时，远远赶不上推广工作的发展。因此，今后必须统一由手工业管理部门负责，大量增建农具修配站。较大的农业生产合作社，应该根据需要和可能设置农具修配小组，使新式农具修配工作深入到社。对零件供应要掌握缺损的规律，制定供应计划，由工厂按季生产品种足够的零件备品，及时供应。
    教育农民掌握新式农具的使用、保养和简单的修理技术，是推广工作的一个重要步骤。各地农业部门必须在春耕以前训练一批技术干部，充作师资，切实做好农民农具手的训练工作。已经有了农具技术手的地区，应以乡或村为单位，组成农具技术传授小组，或联合各乡、各村组织农具技术传授网，以互相交流技术经验，通过群众的互教互学，培养出大批新农具手。
