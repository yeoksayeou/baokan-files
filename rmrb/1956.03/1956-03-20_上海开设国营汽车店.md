    Shanghai Opens State-Owned Automobile Store
    On the 16th, a new state-owned automobile store opened in Shanghai. This store sells eight types of automobiles, including trucks, sedans, large buses, fire engines, and crane trucks, as well as five types of motorcycles and seventeen types of tires of different specifications. The store sells a light truck produced in East Germany that uses diesel fuel and has a load capacity of two tons, suitable for use in rural areas. The store stipulates that agricultural production cooperatives can purchase this type of truck on an installment plan. The store uses old sedans to refit them into light vehicles suitable for rural use, which can carry passengers and also transport goods, and the price is only about one-tenth of that of a general new sedan.

    The automobile store also handles mail-order business, providing transportation services for procurement units in other locations. (Xinhua News Agency)

    上海开设国营汽车店
    十六日，上海新开设了一个国营汽车商店。这个商店经营卡车、轿车、大客车、救火车、起重车等八种汽车、五种摩托车和十七种不同规格的轮胎。这个商店经营一种民主德国出产的轻型卡车，是用柴油作燃料，载重两吨，适合在农村使用。商店规定，农业生产合作社来购买这种卡车，可以分期付款。这个商店利用旧轿车改装成为适合农村使用的轻便车，可以乘客，也可以载货，而车价只有一般新轿车的十分之一左右。
    汽车商店还经营函购业务，为外埠采购单位代运。　（新华社）
