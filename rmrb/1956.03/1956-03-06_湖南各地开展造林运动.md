Hunan Province is enthusiastically launching an afforestation campaign. According to statistics from February 18th, more than 340,000 mu of land have already been afforested across the province. The afforestation work in various regions has been carefully prepared, with good quality and standards. Especially inspired by the 1956-1967 National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), the enthusiasm of farmers in various regions for afforestation is higher than any previous year. The youth of Caotang Township in Hengyang County, under the leadership of the Party branch, formed seven afforestation shock teams, leading the farmers of the entire township to complete the township's original three-year afforestation plan in a single day on February 8th. In the Shaoyang Special District, 12 townships have completed the task of greening the entire township. Cities such as Changsha, Xiangtan, and Shaoyang have also launched tree planting campaigns to green the towns and cities. (Our correspondent in Changsha)

    湖南各地开展造林运动
    湖南省正热烈展开植树造林运动。据2月18日统计，各地已经造林34万多亩。各地造林工作都经过周密的准备，质量和规格很好。特别是在1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）的鼓舞下，各地农民对造林的热情比那一年都高。衡阳县草塘乡的青年，在党支部领导下，组成7个造林突击队，带动全乡农民，在2月8日的一天时间内，就完成了这个乡原订三年完成的造林计划。邵阳专区有12个乡已完成绿化全乡的任务。长沙、湘潭、邵阳等城市，也开展绿化城镇的植树运动。 （本报驻长沙记者）
