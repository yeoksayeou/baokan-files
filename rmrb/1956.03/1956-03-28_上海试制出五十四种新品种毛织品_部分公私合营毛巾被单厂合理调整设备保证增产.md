Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 27th: Shanghai's wool textile factories trial-produced a total of fifty-four new varieties of woolen textiles in the first quarter, exceeding the original trial production plan by nearly one time.

Among these new woolen textiles, there are thirty-five varieties of worsted woolens and nineteen varieties of woolen woolens, with a total of ninety-six colors and patterns. The most eye-catching of the woolen woolens are the four different colors and textures of embossed overcoating produced by the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Wool Textile Factory, which are both thick and soft. Another colored plaid blanket trial-produced by this factory and the five-colored scaly cashmere produced by the joint public-private Huitong Wool Textile Factory are both new products with novel colors and low costs.

Among the thirty-five kinds of worsted woolens, there are simple and elegant striped valitin, silk-like women's woolens, and several light-colored plaid woolens, which are good materials for women's spring and autumn clothing. These new products will be put into production successively within the third and fourth quarters.

Our newspaper Shanghai, 27th: The Shanghai Towel and Bed Sheet Industry Company rationally adjusted the machinery and equipment of some joint public-private factories to ensure increased production of a large number of bed sheets and towels.

According to the material requirements plans of various places, the towels and bed sheets woven in Shanghai are not only insufficient in quantity, but also the varieties are not completely in line with the requirements. The quantity of famous brand goods required by various places exceeds the actual production capacity of each factory by 50%, and at the same time, a batch of new varieties of products are required. Before arranging the production tasks for the second quarter, the Shanghai Towel and Bed Sheet Industry Company made reasonable adjustments to the machinery and equipment of each factory. In the past, some of these factories had some looms shelved and unable to be put into production due to the limitations of the factory buildings; some factories could not give full play to the potential of some workshops due to the imbalance of machinery and equipment. Now reasonable adjustments have been made. In this way, the production potential of each factory will be further developed, and output can be increased.

    上海试制出五十四种新品种毛织品
    部分公私合营毛巾被单厂合理调整设备保证增产
    据新华社上海27日电　上海的毛纺织厂第一季度共试制出五十四种新品种毛织品，超过原订的试制计划将近一倍。
    这些新毛织品当中，有精纺毛织品三十五种、粗纺毛织品十九种，花色共九十六种。粗纺毛织品中最引人注目的，是国营上海第一毛纺织厂的四种不同颜色、不同织纹的拷花大衣呢，它又厚实又柔软。这个厂试制的另一种彩色格子毛毯和公私合营汇通毛纺厂试制的五彩鳞花驼绒，都是花色新颖、成本低廉的新产品。
    三十五种精纺毛织品中，有朴素大方的条子凡立丁，有类似丝绸的女式呢，还有几种浅色格子花呢，都是妇女做春秋服装的好材料。这些新产品将在三、四季度以内陆续投入生产。
    本报上海27日电　上海市毛巾被单工业公司合理地调整部分公私合营工厂的机器设备，保证增产大量被单、毛巾。
    根据各地的要货计划，上海织造的毛巾、被单不但数量上不够供应，品种也不完全合乎要求。各地对名牌货的需要数量，超过各厂实际生产能力50％，同时要求有一批新品种的产品。上海市毛巾被单工业公司在安排第二季度生产任务以前，对各厂的机器设备作了合理的调整。过去，这些工厂有的因为受厂房的限制，一部分织机被搁置起来，不能投入生产；有的工厂因为机器设备不平衡，有些车间的潜力不能发挥。现在都作了合理的调整。这样，各厂的生产潜力都将得到进一步的发挥，产量可以提高。
