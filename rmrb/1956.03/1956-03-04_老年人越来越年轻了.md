Older People Are Getting Younger

National People's Congress Representative Ding Guitang

Last winter, I, along with several representatives of the National People's Congress, went to the Northeast to observe the development of agricultural producers' cooperatives. We visited many villages. In these villages, we were thrilled to see young men and women joyfully and enthusiastically working on establishing, expanding, merging, and upgrading cooperatives, as well as plowing, accumulating fertilizer, hauling manure, threshing, and repairing dams. At the same time, we also saw progressive and energetic elderly people everywhere. They enthusiastically supported the cooperative movement and actively participated in cooperatives and productive labor. Their labor capacity, in some tasks, was not inferior to that of young people, and sometimes even surpassed it. Their enthusiasm further encouraged the initiative of the young people.

In the Jin Xing Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Fuli Village, Shuangcheng County, Heilongjiang Province, there was an elderly woman named Mei, who was already 72 years old but remained a good worker. When she joined the cooperative, she was afraid that people wouldn't want her to work, so she concealed 5 years of her age. When she worked, she had even more energy than young people, and no matter how others advised her to rest, she wouldn't. She often said, "Life is better now, and working is also more energetic." Her actions encouraged the labor enthusiasm of all the women in the village. We asked her how many work points she earned last year, and she naturally replied, "Not for earning points, but for producing more things for the country." Judging from the way she spoke at the time, we firmly believed that her words were completely sincere.

In the same village, in the Qianjin Agricultural Producers' Cooperative, there was an 82-year-old man named Zhang Fa (a bachelor). The leaders of the cooperative thought he was too old and didn't let him work. However, he refused to sit back and enjoy the benefits. He actively tended the cooperative's vegetable garden, never idle throughout the year, treating the cooperative as his home, and never leaving day or night. When Qianjin Cooperative transitioned to a higher-level cooperative, he was overjoyed and excitedly said, "I never thought that I would be able to catch up with socialism at such an old age!"

In Xinli Village, Shuangcheng County, there was a 73-year-old family member of a martyr named Tong Dehai. He not only worked well, but his thinking was also quite progressive. When the news came that his two sons had gloriously sacrificed for the country, he not only didn't shed tears, but also comforted his family and other martyrs' families in the village. This old man never asked the government for assistance or substitute labor. He often said, "We have our own labor force, why should we increase the burden on the country?" During the Spring Festival last year, he orally composed two "Spring Couplets" and asked his grandson to write them out: "Chairman Mao loves the people, overcomes difficulties and sacrifices himself. This great kindness is hard to repay, only to understand his heart." The other one was: "The New Spring arrives, to the New Year, the new people want to do new things; which is old, which is new, pat your chest and ask your conscience." After he read them to us, he also explained to us, saying that "overcomes difficulties and sacrifices himself" refers to Chairman Mao overcoming all kinds of hardships for the benefit of the people of the whole country; "only to understand his heart" means that to be worthy of Chairman Mao, one must respond to his various great calls. "New things" refers to socialism. "Which is old, which is new, pat your chest and ask your conscience" means: whether the old society is good or the new society is good, ask our conscience and we will naturally know.

In the Dengta Agricultural Producers' Cooperative along the Baosha River in Niuzhuang Town, Haicheng County, Liaoning Province, there was a 73-year-old member named Li Jinsheng, who had been actively working since joining the cooperative. He said to us, "Now I really realize that only cooperation can increase production, can get rid of poverty, and is the road to prosperity." In the same cooperative, there was a 72-year-old member named Bao Baiqian, whose family had 6 people. Before joining the cooperative, they lacked food and clothing; after joining the cooperative, he was responsible for herding cattle and actively accumulating fertilizer. Now they are well-fed and clothed, and he works even more actively every day, treating the oxen as his own livestock, caring for their safety and warmth day and night.

Yang Diangong, a 63-year-old member of the Rizeng No. 2 Cooperative in Zhoushi Village, Haicheng County, has been working actively since joining the cooperative, and has handed over all production materials to the cooperative as investment, treating the cooperative as his home, working in the cooperative all day long, and refusing to rest. Jia Dewen, a 63-year-old member of the Xinzongguo Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Miaogou Village, the same county, usually worked very well, and worked even more actively after joining the cooperative. After the great development of the cooperative movement, he was the first to clamor for the establishment of a higher-level cooperative. He said, "I'm so old, I'm afraid I won't catch up with socialism if I'm late!"

Everywhere we saw that the elderly people in the countryside were living younger and younger. Most of these elderly people were poor peasants and farm laborers before liberation. After liberation, they turned over and became masters of their own affairs, no longer being enslaved; they were allocated land, improved their lives, and no longer starved or froze. They recognized the superiority of the cooperative from their actual lives, and had firm confidence and boundless hope in taking the socialist road under the leadership of the Party; and they realized that now that they have joined the cooperative, not only have they solved their own livelihood problems, but the happiness of their descendants is also guaranteed. Recalling the past and looking forward to the future, their mood is naturally cheerful, and their physical strength has also increased accordingly, and their enthusiasm for work is getting greater and greater, even forgetting fatigue from work.

When we visited the countryside, we already felt unprecedented excitement when we saw the thriving and joyous phenomena everywhere; and when we saw these elderly people working with full confidence and enthusiasm, we felt even more unspeakable excitement. We ourselves also felt several years younger. Especially myself. I worked in the old Chinese Customs for more than 30 years and suffered all kinds of bullying and oppression under the rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. With the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese Customs gained autonomy, the old Chinese Customs officers turned over, and I myself became one of the leaders of the People's Customs, and was taken care of by the government. I can truly serve the Chinese people, which has eliminated the pain and depression I suffered spiritually for decades. Since the founding of our country, in just a few years, under the wise and great leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, almost everything has been revived; all measures are good, all conform to the people's wishes and will, and all have achieved great achievements. The construction of a great and strong socialist country is just around the corner. Now I am a citizen of a great country, and in the future our descendants will be able to enjoy the glory and happiness of a great and strong socialist country, which makes me feel extremely happy, my spirit is doubled, and my physical strength is also stronger than before. After visiting the countryside and seeing those energetic elderly people, I feel a little younger myself. I am willing to follow the Chinese Communist Party forever in my remaining years, and under the leadership of the Party, redouble my efforts to study Marxism-Leninism, thoroughly transform my thinking, raise my awareness, and strengthen my position, so that I can more effectively contribute all my strength to the cause of building socialism.

    老年人越来越年轻了
    全国人民代表大会代表　丁贵堂
    去年冬间，我同几位全国人民代表大会的代表到东北看了一下农业生产合作发展的情况。我们访问了许多农村。在这些农村中，我们极兴奋地看到了一般青年男女都欢天喜地兴高采烈地劳动着，在建社、扩社、并社、办高级社，也在翻地、积肥、拉粪、打谷、修坝。同时，我们也到处看见了思想进步、朝气勃勃的老年人。他们欢欣鼓舞地拥护合作化运动，主动积极地参加合作社和生产劳动。他们的劳动能力，在一些工作中并不逊于青年人，有时甚至过之。他们的热情，更鼓舞了青年人的积极性。
    黑龙江省双城县富礼村的金星农业生产合作社，有一位梅老太太，已经72岁了，仍然是一个好劳动力。当她入社的时候，怕人家不要她工作，竟瞒了5岁。她工作起来，比青年人还有劲，无论别人如何劝她休息，她也不休息。她常说：“生活好了，干活也起劲。”她的行动鼓舞了全村妇女的劳动热情。我们问她去年挣多少工分，她很自然地回答：“不为挣分，为的是给国家生产更多的东西。”照当时说话的情形来看，我们肯定地认为，她这番话完全是由衷之言。
    在同一个村子里的前进农业生产合作社，有一个82岁的张发老人（单身汉），社里的领导人员认为他年岁太大，不让他工作。可是，他不肯坐享清福。他主动地为合作社侍弄菜园子，一年到头不闲着，以社为家，日夜不离开。前进社转高级社的时候，他高兴的不得了，激动地说：“想不到我这么大岁数，还赶上了社会主义！”
    双城县的信礼村，有一位73岁的烈属佟德海。他不但劳动得好，思想也相当进步。当他的两个儿子为祖国光荣牺牲的消息传来的时候，他不但没掉泪，还安慰家里的人和同村的烈属。这个老人从来不要政府照顾，不要代耕。他常说：“咱自家有劳动力，为什么要增加国家的负担呢？”去年春节的时候，他口头编了两个“春条”，叫孙子写出来：“毛主席，爱人民，克服苦难舍己身，这大恩典难相报，仅可体贴他的心。”另一条是：“立新春，到新正，新人民要作新事情；哪为旧，哪为新，手拍胸膛问良心。”它给我们念了以后，还给我们解释说：“克服苦难舍己身”是指毛主席为全国人民的利益，战胜了千难万苦；“仅可体贴他的心”是说要对起毛主席，只有响应他的各种伟大的号召。“新事情”是指社会主义。“哪为旧，哪为新，手拍胸膛问良心”，是说：旧社会好或是新社会好，问一问我们的良心自能知道。
    在辽宁省海城县牛庄镇鲍沙河沿的灯塔农业生产合作社，有一个73岁的社员李金生，自入社以来，劳动一直很积极。他对我们说：“现在我真的体会到只有合作化，才能增产，才能摆脱贫困，才是走富裕的道路。”在同社中有一个72岁的社员鲍百千，家有6口人，入社以前缺吃少穿；入社以后，负责牧牛，并且积极积肥，现在已经丰衣足食，每天工作得更加积极，把黄牛当作自己的牲畜，日夜关怀它们的安全和饱暖。
    海城县周石村的日增二社社员杨殿公，63岁，自从加入合作社后，劳动积极，并且把所有生产资料交给合作社，作为投资，以社为家，整天地在社里工作，不肯休息。同县的庙沟村新中国农业生产合作社社员贾德文，63岁，平常劳动就很好，入社后工作更加积极。在合作化运动大发展后，他头一个嚷着要建立高级社。他说：“我这么大岁数，怕再晚就赶不上社会主义了！”
    我们到处都看见，农村里的老年人越活越年轻了。这些老年人在解放前大多数是贫雇农，解放以后翻了身，当家作主，不再受人奴役；分了土地，改善生活，不再挨饿受冻。他们从实际生活中认清了合作社的优越性，对于在党的领导下走社会主义道路有坚强的信心和无限的希望；并且认识到：现在入了社，不但解决了自己的生活问题，就是子孙后代的幸福也有了保障。他们回想以往，瞻望将来，心情自然畅快，体力也就随着增强，干活的劲头越来越大，甚至劳而忘倦了。
    我们访问农村的时候，到处见到欣欣向荣、喜气洋洋的现象，已经感觉空前的激动；又看见了这些老年人满怀信心热情地劳动，更使我们有说不出的兴奋。我们自己也觉得年轻了若干年。特别是我本人。我在旧中国海关工作30多年，受尽了帝国主义和国民党反动统治的欺凌压迫。随着中国共产党和毛主席领导中国人民革命的伟大胜利，中国海关获得了自主，旧中国海关关员翻了身，我自己做了人民海关领导人之一，备受政府照顾，真正能为中国人民服务，使我数十年在精神上所受到的痛苦和闷气，都消除了。我国开国以来，仅仅数年，在中国共产党和毛主席英明伟大的领导下，几乎百废俱兴；凡有措施，样样都好，无一不合乎人民的愿望和意志，无一不获得了伟大的成就。伟大的富强的社会主义的国家的建成，就在眼前。现在我已经是一个大国的人民，将来我们的子孙后代更都能享受着伟大富强的社会主义国家的光荣和幸福，这更使我心情万分愉快，精神倍发，体力也随之较前健壮。访问过农村以后，看见了那些朝气勃勃的老年人，更使我自己感觉又有些年轻。我愿在我有生余年，永远跟着中国共产党，并在党的领导下，加倍努力学习马克思列宁主义，彻底改造我的思想，提高觉悟，坚定立场，使我在建设社会主义的事业中，更有效地供献我所有的力量。
