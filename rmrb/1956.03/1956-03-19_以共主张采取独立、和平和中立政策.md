Xinhua News Agency, Tel Aviv, 18th (TASS dispatch) – The Political Bureau of the Israeli Communist Party has issued a statement entitled "The Majority of the People Demand a Policy of Independence, Peace, and Neutrality."

    The statement emphasizes that "an important transformation is taking place in the Middle East, liberating it from the rule of foreign imperialism," and this transformation is in line with the national interests of Israel. The statement stresses: "But the threat to the peaceful existence of the peoples of the Middle East remains enormous. Imperialist elements, seeing the failure of the Baghdad Pact… are striving to intensify the tense situation in the Middle East. In preparation for military intervention, they are sowing seeds of discord between Israel and Arab countries, and are encouraging the activities of aggressors."

    The statement points out that the United States and Britain are sending "visiting" warships to ports in the region to display a policy of force in the Middle East, and are reinforcing their armed forces stationed in the Eastern Mediterranean.

    The statement says that in Israel itself, certain elements are helping the imperialists, refusing to abandon the bankrupt policy of concluding military treaties with the United States, and openly opposing any compromise on the disputes between Israel and its Arab neighbors.

    The statement says: "However, the number of people supporting this policy is dwindling… The call to abandon the pro-imperialist policy that is leading our country to the brink of the abyss is growing louder and louder. People are demanding a fundamental change in Israel's political line, starting from the principle of satisfying our country's economic, political, and security interests, in order to save it from the danger of war and strengthen its external relations... The example of India, Burma, Egypt, Syria, and other countries that have embarked on the road of independence and opposition to imperialist military blocs... proves to the Israeli public the economic and political benefits of a policy of peace, national independence, and resistance to aggressive alliances..."

    The statement concludes: "The Political Bureau calls on all working people and all patriotic forces... to demand that the government and parliament satisfy the desire of the vast majority of the people for independence, peace, and neutrality."

    以共主张采取独立、和平和中立政策
    新华社据塔斯社特拉维夫18日讯　以色列共产党政治局发表了一项声明，题目是“大多数人民要求采取独立、和平和中立的政策”。
    声明强调指出，“中东正在发生从外国帝国主义的统治下解放出来的重要转变”，这种转变是符合以色列的民族利益的。声明强调说：“但是对中东各国人民的和平生存的威胁仍然是巨大的。帝国主义分子看到了巴格达条约的失败……正在竭力使中东的紧张局势加剧。为了给军事干涉作准备，他们正在以色列和阿拉伯国家之间散播不和的种子，并且在鼓励侵略分子的活动。”
    声明指出，美国和英国正在向这个地区的港口派遣“访问”军舰来在中东显示武力政策，并且在增援它们驻在地中海东部的武装部队。
    声明说，在以色列本国，有某些分子在帮助帝国主义者，不肯放弃同美国缔结军事条约的破产政策，并且公开反对在以色列和阿拉伯邻国的争端上实行任何妥协。
    声明说：“但是，支持这一政策的人数愈来愈少了……要求抛弃把我国引到深渊的边缘的亲帝国主义政策的呼声愈来愈高了。人们要求从满足我国在经济、政治和安全方面的利益的原则出发，根本改变以色列的政治路线，以便把它从战争危险中拯救出来，并且加强它的对外联系……印度、缅甸、埃及、叙利亚和其他走上独立和反对帝国主义军事集团的道路的国家的榜样……向以色列公众证明了和平、民族独立和抵抗侵略性联盟的政策在经济方面和政治方面的好处……”。
    声明最后说：“政治局号召全体劳动人民和一切爱国力量……要求政府和议会满足绝大多数人民争取独立、和平和中立的愿望”。
