We Will Surely Conquer Waterlogging and Drought Disasters
By our reporter Yú Míng

	Fengyang County, which has been plagued by “nine years of famine out of ten” since ancient times, has now undergone tremendous changes. In the severe cold of January, two snowfalls occurred, but the farmers’ hearts were burning with enthusiasm. After the Dongfanghong Agricultural Production Cooperative expanded into a large-scale cooperative, the members are now engaged in large-scale water conservancy construction. People opening mountains and quarrying stones are scattered all over the high and low mountain slopes, and the mountains echo with thunderous sounds. The lime kilns at the foot of the mountain are belching black smoke, producing lime in large quantities. Looking south from the mountain depression, one sees a magnificent procession: thousands of men, women, and children, driving livestock, pushing carts, and carrying loads, coming and going busily on the roads for more than ten miles, transporting soil in a hurry. Many cooperative members have built straw sheds in the mountain depressions, set up stoves, and are working diligently day and night to create a new life. They are using their own strength to build a reservoir that can irrigate 20,000 mu of land.

	The construction of this reservoir will require approximately 200,000 labor days. In the past, for scattered farmers, this was an unimaginable project. Now, the Dongfanghong Agricultural Production Cooperative can build it in three months by allocating only a portion of its members—more than 2,000 laborers.

	They are not only building this one reservoir but are also simultaneously repairing many ponds and dams that have not been repaired for many years. They also plan to build two more reservoirs to intercept the water from the other two small rivers in the area, and to intercept the year-round flowing spring water.

	The result of this agricultural production cooperative's construction of farmland water conservancy will be to increase the yield of spring tobacco from 156 jin per mu to 300-400 jin; the yield of wheat stubble tobacco from 60-70 jin per mu to 200 jin; and the 7,000-8,000 mu of paddy fields will be guaranteed a good harvest every year. This year alone, grain production will be guaranteed to increase by 50% to 70%. In the past, the average grain production per person was more than 500 jin; this year, the average person will receive 750 jin.

	In this place, the farmers who have been threatened by drought for generations will be able to get rid of the threat of ordinary drought forever this year and next year. In the past, only one-tenth of the land could be irrigated here; by next year, the vast majority of the land will be irrigated. In the past, the state had to allocate a large amount of grain every year to supply the area, and the task of delivering flue-cured tobacco to the state could not be completed every year; now, in just one or two years, it will be possible to achieve grain self-sufficiency and complete or overfulfill the task of delivering flue-cured tobacco to the state.

	This is just one of tens of thousands of agricultural production cooperatives in Anhui Province.

	In the basically collectivized rural areas of Anhui, millions of farmers are engaged in large-scale farmland water conservancy construction. From October 1955 to the end of January this year, more than 300,000 projects have been started throughout the province. The amount of work done in one winter is more than the sum of the work done in the past three winters.

	The farmland water conservancy plans of the entire province and of various special districts and counties have been repeatedly broken through by the active actions of the masses. The province's winter and spring construction plan has already been increased by two times compared with the original plan. The Fuyang Special District's plan has been increased by twelve times compared with the original plan. When Lingbi County held a People's Congress, proposals on farmland water conservancy construction accounted for two-thirds of the total proposals. The amount of earthwork done by this county this winter and spring will be equal to the sum of several years since liberation. Ponds and dams that had not been repaired for a hundred years in counties such as Shucheng, Qianshan, and Taihe have been renovated. There are more than 40 million mu of cultivated land in northern Anhui. This winter and spring, 200,000 wells will be drilled, expanding the irrigated area by 10 million mu. In the Fuyang Special District, 1 million people are mobilized every day to drill wells, open ditches, and dig ponds. This year, they are demanding that half of the cultivated land achieve the goal of "having water to conserve moisture in normal times and having water to irrigate during drought." Under the conditions of water conservancy construction, the area of dry land converted to planting paddy rice and upland rice in the whole special district this year will increase nearly two times compared with more than 500,000 mu in 1955.

	For many years, the farmers of Anhui have been tormented by waterlogging and drought, without a chance to catch their breath. Whenever the floods of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers come, tens of millions of mu of land are flooded, and the lives of tens of millions of farmers are threatened. Since liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, millions of farmers in Anhui Province have been working on the dikes and controlling the water every year; now, under normal circumstances, the floods of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers can be controlled. However, Anhui's terrain is complex. Northern Anhui and hilly areas are dry without rain; the low-lying areas of the Huai River and the dike areas of the rivers and lakes are flooded with a little rain. Even in years of bumper harvest in the whole province, there is always a part of the land suffering from waterlogging and drought. According to the climatic conditions of Anhui, it is possible to harvest two to three crops a year, and the unit yield should be relatively high; however, for many years, production has not been able to be rapidly increased due to the entanglement of waterlogging and drought. In recent years, the Anhui Provincial Party Committee has led the farmers to implement the "three reforms" method of "avoiding disasters and ensuring harvests," which has achieved remarkable results. This is also the result of the struggle against waterlogging and drought. Now, after the agricultural collectivization in the whole province, farmers not only have the strength to further avoid disasters and ensure harvests but are also actively engaged in farmland water conservancy construction, fundamentally conquering waterlogging and drought.

	Water conservancy construction especially requires collective operation and collective labor. Many farmers have actively joined agricultural production cooperatives after making water conservancy plans locally, and many small cooperatives have expanded and merged into large cooperatives in the process of making water conservancy plans. The Dongfanghong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fengyang County expanded from many small cooperatives into a large cooperative with more than 4,000 households because of unified water conservancy construction. Beiwu Village in Banjing Township, which was previously considered a "backward" village, immediately demanded that they also be "planned in" when the farmers here learned that the Dongfanghong Agricultural Production Cooperative was going to carry out unified water conservancy construction.

	After the Shuangqiao Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xuancheng County merged into a large cooperative last winter, it immediately began large-scale farmland water conservancy work. The 170,000 cubic meters of earthwork can be completed in 40 days. They also want to reclaim more than 1,000 mu of wasteland. Ordinary waterlogging and drought disasters can be eliminated on the land of the entire cooperative this year. Because there is a sufficient water source guarantee, the area of double-cropping rice will increase from more than 1,000 mu to 25,000 mu this year, and 400 mu of dry land will be converted into paddy fields. As a result of the water conservancy construction of the entire cooperative, grain production can be increased by 1.9 million jin compared with the past, and the average grain yield per mu will be increased to more than 800 jin.

	In order to solve the water conservancy problem, the farmers in Zhuxi Township, Feixi County, expanded and merged many small cooperatives into four large cooperatives. Many lands that could not be irrigated before can now be irrigated after unified planning. There are many ponds, each pond is 5 mu in size, which wastes a lot of land; now, with unified use of water conservancy, many ponds are no longer needed, and a large amount of fertile land has been increased due to abandoned ponds.

	This year, the farmland water conservancy projects built by farmers in Anhui Province are not only large in quantity and have unified planning but are also good and economical. The members of each agricultural cooperative want to make the project more solid and fundamentally overcome waterlogging and drought disasters. In previous years, there were many water conservancy loans, but not many projects were done; this year, there were fewer water conservancy loans than in previous years, but the projects exceeded two or three times those of previous years.

	Water conservancy construction can increase the yield of dry land by one time. With water sources, converting to double-cropping rice can generally increase production by 250 jin to 300 jin compared with single-cropping rice. The plans of tens of thousands of agricultural production cooperatives to increase production in large quantities have boosted the enthusiasm of farmers to build water conservancy in large quantities; the work of water conservancy construction has promoted the consolidation and development of cooperatives.

	According to the scale of farmland water conservancy construction by farmers this winter and spring, according to the estimates of the leading organs of Anhui Province, within 7 years, Anhui Province, which has been prone to disasters since ancient times, can eliminate ordinary waterlogging and drought disasters throughout the province and ensure a bumper harvest every year.

    一定能征服水旱灾害
    本报记者  于明
    自古以来就是“十年倒有九年荒”的凤阳县，现在面貌已经大大改变。严寒的1月，两场雪下过了；农民的心里，却是热腾腾的。东方红农业生产合作社扩大成了大型社以后，社员们正在大规模地兴修水利。高高低低的山坡上布满了开山打石的人群，山里响起了轰轰雷鸣一般的声音。山脚的石灰窑里，突突冒着黑烟，在大量烧制石灰。从山凹里向南望去，是一个雄伟的行列：成千个男女和小孩，赶着牲口，推着小车，挑着担子，在十几里地的道路上来来往往，匆忙地运送土。许多社员在山凹里搭起沙草棚，架起锅灶，日日夜夜为创造新生活辛勤地劳动。他们正在用自己的力量修建一个能灌溉两万亩土地的水库。
    修建这个水库，大约需要20万个劳动日。在过去，对分散经营的农民说来，这是不可能想像的工程。现在，东方红农业生产合作社只拨出一部分社员——2，000多个劳动力，在3个月之内就能够把它修筑起来。
    他们不只是在修建这一个水库，还在同时整修多少年来没有整修的许多塘坝。他们还准备再修筑两个水库，拦蓄境内的另外两条小河里的水，拦蓄终年流着的泉水。
    这个农业生产合作社兴修农田水利的结果，将使春烟每亩产量由156斤提高到三四百斤；麦茬烟每亩产量由六七十斤提高到200斤；七八千亩水稻田将能够年年保收，在今年就能保证粮食生产量提高50％到70％。过去，每人平均产粮食500多斤；今年，每人平均将可得到750斤。
    在这个地方，多少年代遭受旱灾威胁的农民，在今年和明年，就可以永远摆脱普通干旱的威胁了。这里多少年来只有十分之一的土地可以得到灌溉；到明年，绝大部分土地都可以得到灌溉。过去，这里年年要国家调拨大批粮食来供应，年年完不成向国家交售烤烟的任务；现在，只要一两年的时间，就能做到粮食自给，就能完成或超额完成向国家交售烤烟的任务了。
    这只是安徽省几万个农业生产合作社中的一个。
    在基本合作化了的安徽农村里，千百万农民正在大量兴修农田水利。从1955年10月到今年1月底，全省开工的工程有30多万处。一冬所作的工程，比过去三个冬天所作的工程总和还多。
    全省的和各专区、县的农田水利计划，一再被群众的积极行动突破。全省冬春兴修计划已经比原定计划提高了两倍。阜阳专区的计划比原计划提高了十二倍。灵壁县开人民代表大会的时候，关于兴修农田水利的提案，占总提案的三分之二。这个县去冬今春兴修的工程土方，将等于解放以来几年的总和。舒城、潜山、太和等县百年来没有修过的塘坝都修整了。淮北共有4，000多万亩耕地，去冬今春要打20万眼井，使水浇地面积扩大1，000万亩。阜阳专区每天有100万人出动打井、开沟、挖塘，今年就要求在一半的耕地达到“平时有水保墒，旱时有水灌溉”的目标。在兴修水利的条件下，今年全专区旱田改种水旱稻的面积，要比1955年的50多万亩增加将近两倍。
    多少年间，安徽农民一直遭受水旱灾害的折磨，没有喘气的机会。江淮洪水一来，就要有成千万亩土地被淹，成千万农民的生活受到威胁。解放以来，安徽省农民在共产党领导下，年年有成百万人上堤治水；现在，在一般情况下，江淮的洪水已经能够控制了。但是，安徽地势复杂，淮北和丘陵地区不下雨就干旱；淮河低洼地区和江河圩区，稍下雨就涝。即使在全省丰收的年景，也总要有一部分土地遭受着水旱灾害。按照安徽的气候条件，本来一年可收两季到三季，单位产量本来应该比较高；但是，多少年来，就在水旱灾害的纠缠下，不能把生产迅速提高起来。最近几年，安徽省委领导农民实行“避灾保收”的“三改”办法，已经收到显著成效，这也是同水旱灾害斗争的结果。现在，在全省农业合作化以后，农民不但有了进一步避灾保收的力量，而且在积极兴修农田水利，从根本上征服水旱灾害了。
    兴修水利，特别需要集体经营，集体劳动。许多农民在当地作了水利规划以后更积极地参加了农业生产合作社，许多小社在进行水利规划中扩大合并成了大社。凤阳县东方红农业生产合作社，就是因为统一兴修水利，从许多小社扩并成4，000多户的一个大社。拌井乡北五村，过去被认为是“落后”村；当这里的农民知道东方红农业生产合作社将要统一兴修水利的时候，立即要求把他们也“规划进去”。
    宣城县双桥农业生产合作社去年冬天并成大社以后，立即开始了大规模兴修农田水利的工作。17万土方的工程，40天就能完成。他们还要开垦出来1，000多亩荒地。在全社的土地上，今年就可消灭普通水旱灾害。因为有了充足的水源保证，今年双季稻将要由1，000多亩增加到25，000亩，400亩旱地将要改成水田。全社兴修水利的结果，可比以往增产190万斤粮食，粮食每亩平均产量将要提高到800斤以上。
    肥西县竹西乡农民，为了解决水利问题，把许多小社扩并成了4个大社。许多原来不能浇水的土地，经过统一规划，都能浇水了。有许多水塘，每个塘有5亩地大，浪费土地很多；现在统一使用水利，许多水塘不需要了，因为废塘而增加了大量肥沃的土地。
    今年安徽省农民兴修农田水利工程，不但数量大，有统一规划，而且又好、又省。各个农业合作社的社员都想把工程做得更坚固，从根本上克服水旱灾害。往年，水利贷款很多，工程做得不多；今年水利贷款比往年少，工程却超出往年两三倍。
    兴修水利，可以使旱地增产一倍。有了水源，改种双季稻，能比单季稻一般增产250斤到300斤。几万个农业生产合作社大量增产的计划，鼓起了农民大量兴修水利的劲头；兴修水利的工作，又促进了合作社的巩固和发展。
    按照去冬今春农民兴修农田水利的规模，据安徽省领导机关的估计，在7年以内，自古多灾的安徽省，就可以在全省消灭普通的水旱灾害，保证年年丰收了。
