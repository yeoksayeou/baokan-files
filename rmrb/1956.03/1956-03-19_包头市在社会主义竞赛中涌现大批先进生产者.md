In the socialist emulation drive, the ranks of advanced producers in Baotou City continue to grow, and inventions, technological improvements, and breakthroughs in quotas related to production continue to emerge. In February, 3 major types of work, 30 teams, 15 sub-teams, and more than 100 groups under the Baotou Engineering General Company exceeded their quotas, setting new records, and 13 advanced work teams, 77 advanced groups, and 238 advanced producers emerged. Li Zhongfang of the Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways created the "jar-style bottom-expanding blasting method," which, after being promoted throughout the bureau, increased blasting efficiency by four to five times. Employees of the sugar workshop of the state-owned Baotou Sugar Factory put forward 85 suggestions on technical organizational measures and equipment improvements to increase work efficiency, increasing the target of increasing sugar production from 10,000 tons to 21,000 tons. After 9 advanced experiences were promoted in 13 local state-owned and joint state-private factories throughout the city, the total value of output in February was 123.4% of the plan.
