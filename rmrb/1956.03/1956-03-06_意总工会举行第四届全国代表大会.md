Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 4th: Rome dispatch: The Fourth National Congress of the Italian General Confederation of Labor began on February 27th in Rome. Louis Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, and trade union representatives from the Soviet Union, China, various People's Democratic countries, and capitalist countries attended the congress. The Chinese delegation consisted of four people, including Liu Ningyi and Liu Changsheng.

The secretaries of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, Pesci and Santi, delivered reports to the congress on February 28th, respectively. The general topic of the reports was: "To raise the living standards of the working people and improve their social and spiritual conditions at home and in enterprises to meet the tasks of the constitution."

Pesci emphasized that the characteristic of the socio-economic situation in Italy since the Third Congress of the Italian General Confederation of Labor at the end of 1952 is: the domestic monopoly rule continues to strengthen, and the living conditions of the broad masses of working people and the unemployed are increasingly deteriorating. Pesci said that big monopoly capital is the most dangerous enemy of the working people and Italian society, and the struggle against monopoly capital not only meets the requirements of reviving the national economy but is also a basic condition for establishing a truly democratic country.

Pesci accused the current Italian government of not fulfilling its promises regarding implementing democratic reforms in the political and economic spheres and pointed out that Italy must achieve a fundamental transformation—replacing an economy based on exploitation with an economy based on labor.

Pesci finally called for the establishment of a broad front that could unite not only workers and peasants but also small producers and small merchants, craftsmen, clerks, and all those who have been severely damaged by monopoly capital and government economic policies.

The head of the Chinese delegation, Liu Ningyi, delivered a congratulatory message to the congress on the morning of February 29th on behalf of the Chinese delegation. The Chinese delegation also presented gifts to the Italian General Confederation of Labor. At this time, the national anthem of the People's Republic of China was played in the venue, and all the representatives stood up and applauded and cheered, fully expressing the deep friendship of the Italian people towards the Chinese people.

On March 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, the congress discussed Pesci and Santi's reports.

    意总工会举行第四届全国代表大会
    据新华社布拉格4日电  罗马消息：意大利总工会第四届全国代表大会2月27日起在罗马举行。世界工会联合会总书记赛扬和苏联、中国、各人民民主国家、各资本主义国家的工会代表都出席了大会，中国代表团由刘宁一、刘长胜等4人组成。
    意大利总工会书记培西和杉蒂在2月28日分别向大会作了报告，报告的总题目是：“在国内和在企业中提高劳动人民的生活水平和改善它的社会和精神条件使符合宪法的任务”。
    培西强调指出，在1952年年底意大利总工会第三届代表大会以后意大利社会经济情况的特征是：国内垄断统治继续加强，广大劳动人民群众和失业者的生活条件愈来愈恶化。培西说，大垄断资本是劳动人民和意大利社会最危险的敌人，反对垄断资本的斗争不仅符合于复兴国家经济的要求，而且也是建立真正民主的国家的基本条件。
    培西指责现在的意大利政府一直没有履行自己关于在政治方面和经济方面实行民主改革的诺言，并且指出意大利必须实现一个根本的转变——用以劳动为基础的经济代替以剥削为基础的经济。
    培西最后号召建立一个不仅能团结工人和农民，而且还能把小生产者和小商人，手工业者，职员及一切受到垄断资本和政府经济政策严重损害的人们都团结进来的广泛的阵线。
    中国代表团团长刘宁一在2月29日上午代表中国代表团向大会致贺词，中国代表团并且向意大利总工会赠送了礼物。这时，会场奏起中华人民共和国国歌，全体代表起立鼓掌欢呼，充分表示了意大利人民对中国人民的深厚友谊。
    3月1日，2日和3日，大会就培西和杉蒂的报告进行了讨论。
