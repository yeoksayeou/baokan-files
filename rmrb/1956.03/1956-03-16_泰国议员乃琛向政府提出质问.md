Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, March 15th: According to newspapers, Thai Congressman Nai Chern, who was arrested by the Thai government after visiting China, recently submitted an urgent interpellation to Thai Prime Minister Pibul, accusing the government of unwarranted arrest.

In his interpellation, Nai Chern wrote, "Our visit to the People's Republic of China represents the opinions of the Thai people and aims to enhance the friendship between the people of China and Thailand. Does this constitute rebellion? What is the meaning of so-called democracy?"

Nai Chern said, "During our visit to China, the American Ambassador to Thailand flew back to the United States, and former American Ambassador to Thailand, Donovan, immediately came to Thailand and contacted public security agencies. Thailand, under the secret instructions of the United States, conspired to arrest us."

    泰国议员乃琛向政府提出质问
    新华社15日讯　曼谷消息：据报纸报道，在访问中国以后被泰国政府拘捕的泰国议员乃琛最近向泰国总理銮披汶提出一项紧急质问，指责政府对他的无理拘捕。
    乃琛在质问书上写道，我们这次访问中华人民共和国是代表泰国人民的意见，目的是为了增进中泰两国人民的友谊，这是否就算是造反？所谓民主又是什么？
    乃琛说，当我们在中国访问期间，美国驻泰大使曾飞返美国，前美国驻泰大使杜诺万随即来到泰国，并且同公安机关接触，泰国就在美国的指示密谋下把我们逮捕。
