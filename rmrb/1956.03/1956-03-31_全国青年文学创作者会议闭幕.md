Xinhua News Agency, March 30th: The National Youth Literary Creators Conference concluded today. At the final plenary session held this morning, Zhou Yang, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, delivered a report.

In his report, Zhou Yang encouraged young literary creators to become new types of writers in the socialist era. He said that writers should be enthusiastic fighters using their literary weapons for the cause of socialism and communism. The task of our literature is to educate the people in the spirit of communism. Writers must have a deep understanding of life and a communist worldview. To become a true writer, one needs rich life experience, cultivation, and talent, and especially diligent study and practice. Diligent study and practice are the most important manifestations of talent. Whether a writer is a socialist realist is related to whether he has a communist worldview. When a writer grasps the ideological weapon of Marxism-Leninism, he can more easily, keenly, deeply, and accurately see the essence of life when observing it. Zhou Yang said that young literary creators should be vigilant against the erosion of bourgeois individualism, correctly treat literary work, and not regard it as a means of seeking personal fame and gain; literature should always serve the interests of the country and the people; works should reflect the people's labor, struggle, and will, and guide the people's thoughts and feelings to be connected with the noble principles and great goals of communism, freeing themselves from the residual influence of the old society. Literature should promote the role of the masses in historical creation and oppose the cult of personality.

Zhou Yang said that young literary creators should strive to follow the principles of socialist realism in their creation, and truthfully reflect the current life and struggle of the people with unique artistic techniques. Zhou Yang then talked about how to overcome the tendencies of dogmatism and naturalism in works, which violate realism. He said that writers should deeply observe and study the various complex contradictions and struggles in life, distinguish contradictions of different natures, grasp the essential things in the contradictions, and give them concentrated and prominent expression in art through vivid images of characters. Writing about characters should mainly be about their labor, and one should be good at combining the description of social life and personal life.

Zhou Yang also talked about how young literary creators should improve their literary cultivation, learn from all outstanding writers and works, both Chinese and foreign, ancient and modern, and especially learn from their own national traditions; at the same time, they should strengthen the cultivation of moral character. He emphasized that young literary creators should strictly prevent pride and complacency. He said that pride and complacency are the greatest enemies of young literary creators and a terrible trap on their road to progress.

Zhou Yang finally pointed out that the cultivation of young literary creators should be further strengthened in the future; young literary creators should be enthusiastically encouraged, and at the same time, strictly required. Zhou Yang said that the vast majority of young literary creators should adhere to the principle of amateur creation; they should not only adhere to their original work, but also strive to be models in their work, and should make time for writing. Responsible persons of various work departments, especially the Chinese Writers Association and its branches, local literary federations, and editorial departments of various publications, should give active support, help, and enthusiastic care to the amateur writing of young literary creators.

This conference started on March 15th. During the conference, many veteran writers and representatives from relevant units such as the Ministry of Culture and the Chinese New Democratic Youth League made reports and speeches, and the veteran writers also discussed issues such as promoting literary and artistic creation with the young literary creators.

    全国青年文学创作者会议闭幕
    新华社30日讯　全国青年文学创作者会议今天闭幕。在上午举行的最后一次全体会议上，中共中央宣传部副部长周扬作了报告。
    周扬在报告中勉励青年文学创作者作一个社会主义时代的新型的作家。他说，作家应当是用他的文艺武器为社会主义、共产主义事业奋斗的热情战士。我们文学的任务是以共产主义精神教育人民。作家必须有对于生活的深刻理解和共产主义的世界观。要成为一个真正的作家，需要有丰富的生活经验、修养和才能，特别需要勤学苦练。勤学苦练正是才能的一种最重要的表现。作家是不是社会主义现实主义者，是和他是否具有共产主义世界观相联系的。作家掌握了马克思列宁主义的思想武器，他观察生活的时候，就能比较容易地、锐敏地、深刻地、准确地看到生活的本质。周扬说，青年文学创作者要警惕资产阶级个人主义思想的侵蚀，正确地对待文学事业，不要把文学事业看成谋取个人名利的手段；文学应当始终为国家和人民的利益服务；作品应当反映人民的劳动、斗争和意志，引导人民的思想情感同共产主义的高尚原则和伟大目标相联系，脱离旧社会的残余影响。文学应当宣传人民群众在历史创造中的作用，反对个人崇拜。
    周扬说，青年文学创作者应当在创作上努力遵从社会主义现实主义的原则，用独特的艺术手法，真实地反映当前人民的生活和斗争。周扬接着谈到怎样克服作品中的公式主义、自然主义等违反现实主义的倾向。他说，作家应当深刻地观察和研究生活中各种错综复杂的矛盾斗争，区别不同性质的矛盾，抓住矛盾中的本质的东西，通过人物的鲜明形象，在艺术上给以集中的突出的表现。写人物主要应当写他们的劳动，要善于把描写社会生活和个人生活结合起来。
    周扬还谈到青年文学创作者应当提高文学修养，向中外古今的一切优秀作家和作品学习，特别要向自己的民族传统学习；同时应当加强道德品质的修养。他强调指出，青年文学创作者要严格地防止骄傲自满。他说，骄傲自满是青年文学创作者的最大的敌人，是他们前进道路上的可怕陷阱。
    周扬最后指出，今后应进一步加强对青年文学创作者的培养；对于青年文学创作者要热情地鼓励，同时要严格地要求。周扬说，绝大多数的青年文学创作者都应当坚持业余创作的原则；不仅要坚持自己原岗位的工作，而且应当争取做工作中的模范，应当挤时间写作。各工作部门的负责人，特别是中国作家协会及作家协会各分会和各地文联、各刊物编辑部应给青年文学创作者的业余写作以积极的支持、帮助和热情的关怀。
    这次会议是从三月十五日开始的。会议过程中，许多老作家以及文化部、中国新民主主义青年团等有关单位的代表作了报告和发言，老作家们还同青年文学创作者共同讨论了繁荣文艺创作等问题。
