Advanced producers on the industrial front in Shanxi, Anshan, Changchun, Harbin, Xi'an and other provinces and cities have recently gathered separately to exchange various advanced experiences, and have proposed to carry out the advanced producer movement more widely to ensure the early completion of the first Five-Year Plan.

At the Shanxi Provincial Congress of Activists in Socialist Industrial Construction, the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory introduced its experience in organizing the "one and a half quota" movement. In January of this year, the factory used advanced workers to drive the backward, so that more than 34% of the factory's workers became advanced producers who completed 12 hours of work in 8 hours. At the Anshan City Industrial Advanced Producers Representative Conference, 13 representatives introduced various advanced experiences. Shan Rongbi, a steelworker from the No. 7 open-hearth furnace of Ansteel, also introduced at the meeting how they learned the advanced operating methods of the No. 8 open-hearth furnace and transformed the original "old ox" furnace into an advanced furnace. At the Eighth Model Workers Congress in Changchun City, the experience of Ma Hongfen, a model worker from the State-owned No. 8 Rubber Factory, and others in organizing advanced workers to help all workers in the group increase the daily output of rubber shoes from 600 pairs to more than 800 pairs was introduced.

The meetings of advanced producers in Shanxi and other provinces and cities have proposed to widely carry out the advanced producer movement. The advanced producers in Harbin and Xi'an, in their letters to workers in the city, called on all workers in the city to join the advanced producer movement and actively carry out socialist emulation.
