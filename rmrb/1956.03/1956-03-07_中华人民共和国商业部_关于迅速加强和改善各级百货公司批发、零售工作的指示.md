The commodities operated by the China Department Store system are all daily necessities for the vast urban and rural consumers. The quality of the wholesale and retail work of department stores has a great impact on the vast consumers. Especially the work of the retail sector not only plays an extremely important role in fully meeting the needs of consumers, expanding the circulation of daily industrial products, and promoting the production of daily industrial products, but also the quantity and variety of commodities in department stores in a region, to a certain extent, represent the economic and cultural outlook of the entire country and a certain region, reflecting the superiority of socialism.

In recent years, under the leadership of party committees and governments at all levels, the work of department stores has made certain progress, but it still cannot meet the requirements of the developing situation. Especially after the upsurge of agricultural cooperativization and the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and in the context of drastic changes in the social economy, the work of department stores has lagged far behind the situation. The prominent situations at present are: In terms of wholesale work, the institutions are not deep enough, the commodities cannot meet consumers well, the varieties and types are not suitable for local needs, and the untimely supply is still quite serious. In the countryside, the combination with supply and marketing cooperatives is not close enough, many commodities cannot reach the countryside, and out-of-stock situations are also quite serious. The trial sales of new products have not been carried out in a planned manner. In terms of retail work, except for the department store retail stores in cities such as Beijing, Nanjing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Qingdao, where the varieties and types of commodities are relatively complete, but still need to be increased and improved, the department store retail stores in many cities have few varieties, incomplete types, monotonous displays, and complicated sales procedures. Some department store retail stores have not been able to fully utilize existing houses due to the small number of commodity varieties. Some rarely sell commodities from other state-owned commercial companies. The business hours of some stores cannot meet the needs of the people. Often, when employees get off work, the stores are closed, and consumers are dissatisfied. In many new industrial and mining areas, the varieties supplied by state-owned department stores are even more incomplete. For example, employees in the Yumen mining area need canned food, and the Qinghai mining area needs steel pots, but they are not easy to buy in stores, and these are all commodities with sufficient inventory in department stores. In particular, the state-owned department store retail stores in Hangzhou City not only have small locations, poor lighting, and incomplete varieties (for example, they sell pens but not ink), but also do not operate many local specialties such as Qingtian stone carvings, Zhang Xiaoquan's scissors, and Tianzhu chopsticks (because state-owned companies do not operate them, Tianzhu chopsticks are sold for two jiao per pair in the Hangzhou market, while they are sold for only one jiao and six fen in Changsha); the varieties of silk fabrics are very few, and the display position is not prominent. Hangzhou is a national scenic area, and many people from home and abroad come here to visit every year. If state-owned department store retail stores are not managed well, they will not only fail to fulfill their due responsibilities to the production of Hangzhou City and fail to establish the banner of state-owned commerce to meet the needs of the people and expand commodity circulation, but also have a bad political impact.

The shortcomings currently existing in the wholesale and retail work of the department store system are serious. The reasons why these situations have existed for a long time without being overcome in time are mainly that the leadership of the Department Store General Company does not have a sufficient understanding of the seriousness of the shortcomings and errors of the system and has emotions of fear of difficulties and pushing responsibility to objective factors; in terms of working methods, they do not grasp the key points, do not go deep, and always remain at a general leadership level. The Ministry of Commerce has not promptly inspected and put forward improvement opinions in the past, which is also a responsibility. If it is not rapidly improved in the future, it will be difficult to adapt to the new situation. Therefore, in addition to ordering the Department Store General Company to quickly correct errors in leadership thinking and working methods, specific instructions are given on several major aspects of the issue as follows:

1. Wholesale work:

(1) The current key task of first-level purchasing and supply stations and other second-level stations with purchasing tasks is to make the commodity varieties and types suitable for local needs and to implement the principle of pricing according to quality and the trial production and sales of new products. For this purpose:

A. The specific varieties, specifications, and types of commodities purchased and supplied should, as far as possible, fully meet the requirements of the requesting units. Efforts should be made to organize the varieties needed by sales units to meet the supply.

B. In terms of commodity varieties, quality, and types, purchasing and supply stations at all levels should sign specific contracts with production units when processing orders, listing the quantity, varieties, specifications, quality, types, prices, delivery dates, and responsibilities for violating the contract. There should be clear provisions in the contract and strict implementation. Purchasing and supply stations at all levels should also set up commodity inspection sections to strictly inspect according to the contract and implement the principle of pricing according to quality to prevent inferior and high-priced commodities from entering the commodity circulation channels.

C. Promoting industrial departments to continuously produce new products is an extremely important task for commercial departments in the future. General and provincial companies, first-level stations, and second-level stations with large purchasing tasks should set up organizations such as commodity research departments (sections) to specifically be responsible for investigating and studying people's needs and research and trial sales of new product creation.

(2) Second-level stations and branch companies with supply tasks, in addition to doing a good job in commodity supply in accordance with the commodity allocation method of "combining top-down allocation and bottom-up requisition," should mainly speed up warehousing procedures and reduce commodity losses. Each province should hold an advanced experience exchange meeting for warehousing procedures of second-level stations within the year. On this basis, the Department Store General Company will hold a national storage and transportation meeting to summarize advanced experiences and promote them.

(3) Basic-level sales units should mainly do a good job in expanding the supply of industrial products to the countryside and matching the types and varieties. The current focus is:

A. Rapidly extend the institutions downward, and department store institutions should go deep into key towns at and below the county level. In county towns, both wholesale and retail should be operated, while key towns below the county level should only operate wholesale. Guangxi Province decided to extend the wholesale institutions downward to three per county in December last year, which is a good measure. For the commodities of other state-owned companies whose institutions have not been extended downward, department stores should actively operate them like their own products.

B. State-owned department stores in cities and county towns should, under the leadership of the local commercial bureau, arrange the business of supply and marketing cooperatives and department store retail stores that have been jointly operated, consigned, distributed, and cooperated, or private department store businesses that have not yet been transformed, in accordance with the principle of overall planning for the entire industry. All commodities operated by department stores should be supplied to them as much as possible, and they should be urged to actively operate and expand sales to ensure the supply of urban and rural people.

C. Each county-level store should be a unit for preparing plans. All commodity circulation plans and requisition plans must be independently prepared and reported by the county and should not be prepared and reported by the superior company. And before the peak season this year, county-level stores should be used as accounting units.

D. In order to enable basic-level units to have full-time institutions and personnel responsible for organizing supply sources and improving supply work, it is necessary to implement the manager responsibility system and the purchasing manager system. Each county and city store should be equipped with a purchasing deputy manager. The tasks of this deputy manager are:

1.  Responsible for organizing different commodities needed by different consumers in the supply area in the most economical way of circulation to ensure sufficient supply.

2.  Continuously organize and introduce new products to consumers in the supply area to improve the material and cultural living standards of the people.

3.  Responsible for organizing and strengthening the investigation and research work of people's needs. In addition to regularly researching and analyzing the changing needs of the people in the supply area, they should organize forces and promote supply and marketing cooperatives to widely investigate the needs of agricultural, fishery, salt industry, and other production cooperatives and farmers in the supply area for specifications, varieties, and types before a certain sales season.

E. Maintain close contact with supply and marketing cooperatives, regularly convene supply meetings, supplementary requisition meetings, and commodity exchange meetings, sign supply contracts according to the requisition plans proposed by supply and marketing cooperatives, and supply various commodities in a timely manner. When necessary, special personnel should be sent to supply and marketing cooperatives to promote sales, so that supply and marketing cooperatives can select commodities suitable for rural sales to ensure rural supply.

F. With the growth of people's purchasing power, especially the continuous improvement of farmers' living standards, the supply task of small commodities will become increasingly important and heavy. Each province should separate small commodities from department store wholesale stations and set up a special department. Some provinces can set up a small commodity wholesale station in the provincial capital to specialize in organizing small commodity sources for wholesale to county and city stores. Hunan Province Department Store has already started to implement this method and has achieved certain results. The Department Store General Company has been ordered to summarize experience, organize discussions, and promote it at the Eighth Manager Conference.

For handicrafts, each sales unit can process or purchase some locally to supply the needs of local people. The small commodity wholesale department should also appropriately control the supply of goods to various places. However, the original self-produced and self-sold handicrafts should not adopt the method of complete sales, so as not to affect the original sales channels and affect the improvement and even the improvement of the quality of handicrafts.

G. Basic-level retail stores should be given a certain degree of freedom in purchasing maneuverability, and 10% to 20% of the store's total purchase amount can be allowed to freely purchase other commodities other than the allocated commodities. For allocated commodities, in addition to the already signed contracts, if the second-level station does not have the varieties requested by the store, the store should also be allowed to purchase them elsewhere on its own, but the original contract must still be strictly implemented. The second-level station should set up a purchasing trust department to act as an agent for county stores to purchase designated small commodities. Some stores can directly purchase goods from the place of origin and can save circulation costs, and they should be gradually allowed to directly purchase goods from the place of origin and direct transportation from the place of origin to the store.

H. In order to do a good job in wholesale promotion, especially the promotion work in rural areas, the general and provincial companies should set up promotion departments or rural supply work departments (sections), mainly responsible for leading the supply work in rural areas and continuously summarizing and promoting advanced promotion experiences. This department (section) should hold one or two meetings within the year. Before the end of this year, each province is required to produce a book or journal to promote advanced promotion methods.

2. Retail work:

(1) Department store retail stores in various cities should, on the basis of the transformation of the entire private commercial industry, give full play to the advantages of socialist department stores and fully utilize the original commercial network of department stores and their characteristics in accordance with the spirit of overall planning. Under this premise:

A. Beijing Wangfujing Department Store and Shanghai No. 1 Department Store should gradually be created into national exemplary department stores. Experiences should be continuously summarized, advanced working methods should be created, and good systems and experiences created in various places should be absorbed and first organized for implementation. All good commodities, important specialties, and new product types in the country should be organized for retail by Beijing Wangfujing Department Store and Shanghai No. 1 Department Store.

B. Department stores in cities such as Tianjin, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Xi'an should operate more than 150,000 varieties. Department stores in other provincial capitals should have about 150,000 varieties of commodities. The number of varieties that should be operated in city and county stores below the provincial capital should be determined by each province.

C. Department stores in large and medium-sized cities can gradually set up specialized stores according to market needs, such as children's products stores, women's products stores, and shoe and hat stores, but it should be combined with the full utilization of the joint state-private commercial network. Some joint state-private commercial enterprises with fixed shares and fixed interest originally have professional characteristics and have expertise, and their strengths should be fully utilized and given the same treatment as state-owned specialized stores.

(2) Department store retail stores must, as far as possible, concurrently operate the commodities of other state-owned commercial companies to facilitate consumer purchases.

(3) The selection of commodity varieties should start from fully meeting the needs of the supply area to make the operation of commodities complete. The commodities of the department stores in the provincial capitals must also reflect the political and economic outlook of the entire country and the rich material strength, and also reflect the characteristics of the province. For this reason, the famous local specialties of the province and the nationally famous local products, as well as other commodities needed by the people in the supply area, should be included as much as possible.

(4) Some department store retail stores in large cities, such as those with many social commercial networks and overcrowded department store retail stores, can consider appropriately reducing some low-end commodities and expanding and strengthening the operation of mid- and high-end commodities based on the principle of overall division of labor.

(5) Store windows and interiors should be decorated and displayed well under the principle of economy, and full attention should be paid to seasonality. Strengthen the cleanliness and hygiene of the shopping malls to achieve cleanliness, neatness, fullness, and beauty.

(6) Business hours should be suitable for the needs of local consumers, and the system of continuous shift work must be resolutely implemented. This can not only avoid employee fatigue but also ensure sufficient business hours to facilitate consumers to purchase commodities at any time. The practice of opening late, closing early, and breaking away from the masses must be resolutely improved. Sales procedures should be simplified, and the card sales method, group responsibility system, and other effective advanced methods of Guangzhou stores should be promoted. Strengthen the political work of employees, care for the lives and studies of salespersons, and prepare conditions to gradually implement the incentive wage system to improve the service quality of salespersons.

(7) Department store retail stores (or department stores) in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an, Wuhan, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Jinan, Qingdao, and Harbin that do not currently purchase goods directly from the Department Store Central Station should quickly create conditions and gradually achieve direct procurement. Department stores and county stores in other cities should also create conditions to develop direct picking of goods in a planned and step-by-step manner, and the provincial company should stipulate a numerical amount for self-procurement or self-processing to allow them to self-procure within the prescribed range.

(8) In order to implement the above methods, each retail store and retail outlet must be equipped with a deputy business manager (or director). Large department stores should be equipped with a business manager (or director) on each floor. Their main responsibilities are:

1. According to the needs of the people in the region, expand the varieties and types of operations through procurement or their own processing to meet the needs of the people.

2. Continuously improve the display of commodities and simplify the procedures for sales and payment.

3. Responsible for improving various tasks according to the opinions of consumers and handling various opinions put forward by customers in the opinion book.

4. Strictly educate employees to prevent them from having a bad attitude towards customers.

(9) The general and provincial companies should establish a retail trade management department (section) in the second quarter to be responsible for managing the retail trade work in the country (province) and continuously summarize and promote retail trade experience.

The above are the main aspects of changing the current backward situation of the department store system. It is hoped that the commercial halls (bureaus) of each province (city) will organize implementation and strengthen the leadership of department stores, regularly organize manpower to conduct inspections and supervision, and help them solve difficulties in their work in a timely manner. Other aspects are also hoped that local governments will study and arrange them according to specific circumstances.

It is hoped that the above will be studied and implemented in various places.

### 中华人民共和国商业部  关于迅速加强和改善各级百货公司批发、零售工作的指示

专栏：

    中华人民共和国商业部
    关于迅速加强和改善各级百货公司批发、零售工作的指示	一
    中国百货公司系统经营的商品，都是城乡广大消费者日常所需要的。百货公司批发、零售工作的好坏，对广大消费者有着极大的影响，尤其是零售部门的工作，不仅对充分满足消费者的需要，扩大日用工业产品的流通和促进日用工业品的生产，起着极其重大的作用，而且一个地区的百货门市部的商品多少，花色如何，还在一定程度上代表整个国家和某一地区的经济文化面貌，体现着社会主义的优越性。
    几年来，在各级党政的领导下，百货公司的工作是有一定进步的，但仍不能适应形势发展的要求，特别是在农业合作化和资本主义工商业改造进入高潮以后，在社会经济发生剧烈变化的情况下，百货公司的工作，已远远地落在形势的后面。目前突出的情况是：在批发工作方面，机构不深入，商品不能很好地同消费者见面，花色、品种不适合当地需要和供应不及时等情况，仍是相当严重；在农村里，同供销社的结合还不够密切，不少商品到不了农村，脱销的情况也是相当严重。新产品的试销工作，没有有计划地展开。在零售工作方面，除了北京、南京、上海、广州、青岛等城市的百货公司零售店，商品的品种、花色比较齐全，但仍须努力增加和改进外，很多城市的百货零售商店都是品种少、花色不全、陈列单调、售货手续繁复。有的百货零售商店由于商品品种不多而没有能够充分利用已有的房屋。有的很少出售其他国营商业公司的商品。有的商店的营业时间不能适应人民需要，往往是职工下班，商店停业，消费者不满。在不少新工矿区里，国营百货商店供应的品种更不齐全，如玉门矿区职工需要罐头，青海矿区需要钢精锅，但在商店里不易买到，而这些都是百货公司库存充足的商品。特别是杭州市国营百货零售商店，不仅地位小、光线差、品种不全（例如：卖钢笔不卖墨水），连本省的许多特产如青田石的雕刻、张小全的剪子、天竺筷子（由于国营公司不经营，天竺筷子在杭州市场售价每把二角，而在长沙售价只有一角六分）都不经营；绸缎的花色品种非常少，陈列地位也不显著。杭州是全国名胜地区，每年有不少国内外人士到这里来游览，国营百货零售商店经营得不好，不仅没有对杭州市的生产负到应有的责任，不能树立国营商业的旗帜，达到满足人民需要，扩大商品流转的要求，而且在政治上也会起着不好的影响。	二
    目前百货公司系统批发和零售工作方面存在的缺点是严重的。这些情况长期存在而没有及时克服的原因，主要是百货总公司的领导思想上对本系统的缺点和错误的严重性认识不足，存在着怕困难和推客观的情绪；在工作方法上，没有抓重点，不深入，始终停留在一般化的领导上。过去商业部没有及时检查，提出改进意见，也是有责任的；今后如果不迅速改善，就难以适应新的情况，因此，除责成百货总公司迅速改正领导思想和工作方法方面的错误外，特就几个主要方面的问题，指示如下：
    ⒈批发工作方面：
    （1）一级采购供应站及其他有采购任务的二级站，当前的工作重点是要使商品的品种花色适合当地的需要，贯彻执行按质论价和新产品的试制试销工作，为此：
    甲、商品的采购供应、其具体品种、规格、花色，应该尽可能充分满足各要货单位的要求，要尽一切力量组织销售单位所需要的品种，以满足供应。
    乙、在商品品种、质量、花色方面，各级采购供应站在加工定货时应该同生产单位订立具体合同、列举商品数量、品种、规格、质量、花色、价格、交货日期，及违反合同的责任等，在合同上均应有明确规定并严格执行，各级采购供应站并且应该设置商品验收科，按照合同，严格验收。并贯彻按质论价原则，以防止质次价高商品流入商品流通渠道。
    丙、推动工业部门不断生产新的产品，是今后商业部门极为重要的一项任务，总、省公司，一级站和采购任务较大的二级站，均应设置商品研究处（科）的组织，专门负责调查研究人民需要和对创造新产品的研究试销等工作。
    （2）有供应任务的二级站和分公司，除必须按照“自上而下的分配与自下而上的要货相结合”的商品分配办法，做好商品的供应外，主要的应该迅速加快出入库手续，减少商品损耗，各省应在年内召开一次二级站出入库手续的先进经验交流会，在这一基础上，由百货总公司召开全国的储运会议，总结先进经验，加以推广。
    （3）基层销货单位，主要应做好扩大工业品下乡，和品种花色的对路工作，目前的重点是：
    甲、迅速地下伸机构，要把百货机构深入到县和县以下的重点集镇上去。在县城，应该批零兼营，县以下的重点集镇则只经营批发。广西省已在去年12月决定批发机构下伸、每县三个、这个措施很好。对于机构未下伸的其他国营公司的商品，百货公司应该像自营商品一样的积极经营。
    乙、各城市和县城国营百货公司，在当地商业局领导下，对供销合作社和已经合营、代销、经销、合作化的百货零售商店，或者还没有改造的百货私商，都应该按照全行业统筹的原则，安排他们的营业。凡是百货公司经营的商品应该对他们尽量供给货源，并督促他们积极经营，扩大推销，保证城乡人民的供应。
    丙、各县级商店，应为编制计划的单位，一切商品流转计划及要货计划必须由县独立编报，不应由上级公司代编代报。并在今年旺季前，以县级商店为核算单位。
    丁、为了使基层单位有专职机构与人员，负责货源组织，提高供应工作，要实行经理负责制和进货经理制度，每一县、市商店，要配备一个进货副经理，这个副经理的任务是：
    一、负责以最节省流转费用的办法，组织本供应区内不同消费者所需要的不同商品，保证充分供应。
    二、不断组织介绍新的产品给本供应区的消费者，以提高人民物质、文化生活水平。
    三、负责组织和加强人民需要的调查研究工作，除经常的研究分析本供应区人民需要的变化情况外，应在一定销售季节前，组织力量并推动供销社，广泛调查本供应区内农业、渔业、盐业等生产合作社以及农民对规格、品种、花色的需要。
    戊、经常和供销合作社保持密切联系，定期召集供应会议、补充要货会议、商品交流会，按供销社所提要货计划，订立供应合同，及时供应各种商品，必要时并应派专人带货到供销社推销，使供销社能够选择适销农村的商品，以保证农村供应。
    己、随着人民购买力的增长，特别是农民生活水平的不断提高，小百货供应任务，将日趋重要和繁重，各省应从百货批发站内，把小百货分出来，专门成立一个部门，有些省则可在省会所在地专门成立一个小商品批发站，专门组织小百货货源，对县、市商店批发。这个办法湖南省百货公司已经开始实行，并且取得一定的成绩，现已责成百货总公司总结经验，在八届经理会议上组织讨论、推广。
    对手工业的产品，各销售单位可就地加工或收购一部分供应当地人民需要，小百货批发部亦应适当掌握货源供应各地。但原来自产自销的手工业产品，不应该采取全部包销的办法，以免影响原有的销路和影响手工业产品质量的改进以至提高。
    庚、对基层零售商店，应该给以一定的自由采购的机动权，可在该商店总进货额的10％到20％允许商店自由采购分配商品以外的其他商品。在分配以内的商品，在已订合同以外，商店所要品种，二级站无货供应者，亦应允许商店向别处自行采购，但原订合同，仍须严肃执行。二级站应设立采购信托部，代理县商店采购指定的小百货。有些商店能够直接向产地进货，并能节约流转费用的，应逐步的允许他们直接向产地进货，和产地对商店直达运输。
    辛、为了做好批发推销工作，特别是对农村的推销工作，总、省公司应成立推销处或农村供应工作处（科），主要负责对农村供应工作的领导，和不断总结并推广先进的推销经验。这个处 （科）应在年内召开一次到二次会议，在今年年底以前，要求每省各出一本推广先进推销方法的书刊。
    ⒉零售工作方面：
    （1）各城市百货零售商店，应该在对私营商业全行业改造的基础上，根据统筹安排的精神，充分发挥社会主义百货商店的优越性和充分利用原有百货商业的商业网和它们的特点，在此前提下：
    甲、北京王府井百货商店和上海市第一商店应逐步创造成为全国示范性的百货商店。应不断的总结经验，创造先进工作方法，并吸取各地创造的好的制度和经验，首先组织推行。全国好的商品，重要特产，新的产品花色，北京王府井百货商店和上海第一百货商店都应该组织零售。
    乙、天津、南京、杭州、武汉、广州、重庆、西安等城市百货商店经营的品种应有150，000种以上。其他省会所在地的百货商店，应有150，000种左右的商品，省会以下，市、县商店，应经营多少品种由各省自行规定。
    丙、各大、中城市的百货商店，可以根据市场需要，逐步设立专业商店，如儿童用品商店、妇女用品商店、鞋帽商店等，但应该与公私合营商业网的充分利用相结合，有些定股定息的公私合营商业，本来就有专业性质，而且有专长的，就应当充分利用和发挥他们的长处，当国营专业商店一样看待。
    （2）百货零售商店，必须尽可能兼营其他国营商业公司的商品，以便利消费者购买。
    （3）商品品种的选择，应从充分满足本供应区需要出发，使经营商品齐全。省会的百货商店的商品，还必须体现整个国家政治经济面貌和丰富的物资力量，同时也要体现本省的特点。为此，并应把本省闻名的和全国闻名的土特产，以及其他本供应区人民所需要的商品，都尽可能包括在内。
    （4）有些大城市的百货零售店，如原来社会商业网很多，而百货零售店过分拥挤，可以考虑根据统筹分工的原则，百货公司大的零售店可适当减少些低档商品扩大和加强中高档商品的经营。
    （5）商店橱窗及内部，应在节约的原则下作好装饰和陈列工作，充分注意到季节性。加强商场清洁卫生，做到清洁、整齐、饱满、美观。
    （6）营业时间要适合当地消费者的需要，要坚决实行连带上班制，这样，既可避免职工疲劳，又可保证有充分的营业时间，便利消费者随时购买商品；那种迟开门、早停业、脱离群众的做法必须坚决改进。要简化售货手续，推行广州市商店的卡片售货法、小组责任制和其他有效的先进方法。加强对职工的政治工作，关心营业员的生活、学习，并应准备条件，逐步推行奖励工资制度，提高营业员的服务质量。
    （7）北京、天津、上海、南京、杭州、重庆、西安、武汉、沈阳、广州、济南、青岛、哈尔滨等百货零售店（或百货大楼），目前还没有直接向百货中央站进货的，应迅速创造条件，逐步做到直接采购。其他城市的百货商店和县商店，亦应创造条件，有计划有步骤的开展直接取货，并应由省公司规定一个自行采购或自行加工的金额数字，允许他们在规定范围内自行采购。
    （8）为了贯彻以上办法，各个零售商店和零售门市部，都必须配备一个业务副经理（或主任），大型百货商店应该每楼配备一个业务经理（或主任）其主要职责是：
    一、按照本地区人民需要，通过采购或本身的加工，扩大经营的品种、花色，满足人民需要。
    二、不断改善商品的陈列，简化售货和付款的手续。
    三、负责按照消费者的意见，改善各项工作，处理顾客在意见簿上所提出的各项意见。
    四、严格教育职工，防止他们对顾客的态度不好。
    （9）总、省公司应在二季度内成立零售贸易管理处（科），负责管理全国（省）的零售贸易工作，不断总结和推广零售贸易经验。
    以上是改变百货系统目前落后状况的几个主要方面，希各省（市）商业厅（局）组织实施，并加强对百货公司的领导，经常地组织人力，进行检查、督促，及时帮助他们解决工作上的困难。其他方面，亦希各地根据具体情况，加以研究安排。
    以上希各地研究贯彻执行。
