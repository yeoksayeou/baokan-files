    Strive to Fulfill This Year's Enrollment Plan for Higher Education Institutions
    Our people are making efforts in all aspects to change China's backwardness in economy, science, and culture, and strive to reach the world's advanced level in a not-too-long period, and build our motherland into a highly industrialized socialist country. In order to realize this great goal, Chairman Mao instructed us: "The decisive factor is to have cadres, to have a sufficient number of excellent scientific and technological experts."
    In the 32 years from 1918 to 1950, the Soviet Union cultivated a total of 2 million higher education graduates. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan, it cultivated another 1.12 million graduates from higher education institutions and specialized schools. By 1955, there were 1.86 million students in Soviet higher education institutions, with an average of 86 college students per 10,000 residents. From this, it can be seen that to build China into a highly industrialized socialist country, at least one to two million experts must be trained.
    During the Kuomintang rule, our country was very backward in culture. Taking 1947, the most developed year for higher education, there were only three college students per 10,000 residents. Since liberation, thanks to the attention of the Party and the People's Government, China's higher education has developed rapidly. In the second half of 1955, the number of students in Chinese higher education institutions had increased to nearly twice that of 1947. In the past six years, Chinese higher education institutions have trained a total of 217,900 graduates, which is more than 7,000 more than the total number of higher education graduates in the old China in the past 50 years.
    However, the scale, speed, and quality of development of China's higher education are still far behind the actual needs of China's socialist construction. Currently, China has only five college students per 10,000 residents. On a per capita basis, the Soviet Union has sixteen times more than us, and Poland has nine times more than us.
    In order to adapt to the rapid development of China's socialist construction and catch up with the world's advanced scientific levels as soon as possible, and to cultivate a sufficient number of excellent scientific and technological experts, it is necessary to appropriately expand the scale of cadre training in higher education institutions. This year's higher education institutions plan to enroll 165,550 students, an increase of 39,140 compared to the original target of the First Five-Year Plan, which is absolutely necessary. However, we are now facing a serious difficulty of insufficient student sources. This requires expanding student sources from all aspects and doing a good job in pre-examination tutoring to ensure the quality of this year's higher education enrollment. From the perspective of the needs of the socialist cause, this is a serious political task.
    To expand student sources, in addition to mobilizing all of this year's graduating high school students and some graduates of secondary vocational schools to apply for higher education institutions, we must also mobilize some incumbent cadres in government agencies and incumbent primary school teachers to freely apply for higher education institutions. At the same time, we must also plan to transfer some professional cadres from factories, mines, enterprises, and the health system to apply for schools. However, the leaders of Party and government agencies, mass organizations, and enterprise management agencies at all levels do not all have a consistent understanding of this issue. Many leading comrades think this way: now the work tasks are becoming increasingly heavy, and the personnel need to be streamlined again, with few people and many things, how is it possible to send cadres to school? It is true that the work tasks in all aspects are now very heavy, and transferring young incumbent cadres with a high school education level, good health, and political progress to school may indeed cause some temporary difficulties for the work of the unit. However, these difficulties should be said to be overcomeable. As long as we conduct an in-depth inspection, there will be more or less a phenomenon of backlog and waste of cadres in various departments. It is not completely impossible to find ways to squeeze out some cadres to go to school for further study. The key issue is that all leading comrades must proceed from the needs of the entire country and the entire socialist cause, rather than from the needs of one region or one unit; from the perspective of continuously improving working methods, rather than from conservatism that sticks to conventions.
    To ensure the completion of the above enrollment plan, we must also, in accordance with the spirit of the Central Committee's instructions on the issue of intellectuals, pay attention to overcoming and preventing the tendency of being overly strict with the issue of enrollment for unemployed youth in society. Due to the victorious progress of the socialist cause and the rapid improvement of China's international status, many young people who were poisoned by some reactionary ideas in the past have gradually awakened and demanded to study and make progress and serve the motherland and the people. For these young intellectuals in society, we must resolutely give them the opportunity to go to school for further study and serve the country, and we should not blindly suspect and distrust them. We must absorb all the young people and intellectuals who can be absorbed into our socialist cause and cultivate them into useful talents. On this issue, any view that underestimates the progressive factors and potential of these young people is harmful.
    The socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in large and medium-sized cities in China has been basically completed. There are still a certain number of young employees with the equivalent of a high school diploma working in various industries and sectors of joint state-private ownership. After overall arrangements and reasonable adjustments in various industries and sectors, although most people will continue to stay in their original departments to work, a small number of them can also be encouraged to apply for higher education institutions for further study. The state should also encourage those progressive young intellectuals in the industrial and commercial circles who have emerged during the socialist transformation to voluntarily apply for higher education institutions.
    In order to meet the quality requirements of higher education institutions for new students, it is also necessary to earnestly do a good job in pre-examination tutoring for incumbent cadres, unemployed youth in society, employees of joint state-private enterprises, and young intellectuals in the industrial and commercial circles. To this end, all relevant parties must give those incumbent cadres (including professional and technical cadres) and employees of joint state-private enterprises who are preparing to enroll a certain amount of study time, so that they can conduct more than three months of course tutoring according to the requirements of the higher education institution examination syllabus, and help them make up for the knowledge they have not learned in the past, and review the knowledge they have learned and forgotten in the past, so as to increase their chances of being admitted. Last year, three-quarters of the incumbent cadres who applied failed the exam, and this situation must be resolutely changed this year.
    Because many people have been away from school for a long time and their studies have become rusty, and today they cannot completely leave their jobs to study, with little study time, and they have to study well, education administrative departments and universities and middle schools at all levels should also be responsible for selecting a group of teachers with more teaching experience to help do a good job in teaching tutoring courses.
    In order to do a good job in expanding student sources and pre-examination course tutoring, we hope that Party committees at all levels will urge government education departments to earnestly expand student sources, earnestly do a good job in pre-examination course tutoring and enrollment preparation, and promptly criticize and overcome various conservative ideas, departmentalism, and bureaucratic work styles that are indifferent to the course tutoring of candidates. Local newspapers, radio stations, trade unions, and youth league organizations should all cooperate with this action and assist in doing this work. Cultivating a sufficient number of excellent higher education graduates and scientific and technological experts is an important task for the entire Party and the people of the whole country at present, and we must not regard it as merely the task of government education departments.

### 努力完成今年高等学校招生计划

    努力完成今年高等学校招生计划
    我国人民正在从各方面努力来改变我国经济上和科学文化上的落后状况，要争取在不太长的时期内达到世界上的先进水平，把我们的祖国建设成为高度工业化的社会主义国家。为了实现这个伟大的目标，毛主席指示我们说：“决定一切的是要有干部，要有数量足够的、优秀的科学技术专家。”
    苏联在1918年到1950年的32年中，共计培养了200万高等学校毕业生。在第五个五年计划期间，又培养了高等学校和专科学校毕业生112万人。到1955年，苏联高等学校在校学生已有186万人，平均每一万个居民中就有86个大学生。由此可知，要把我国建设成为高度工业化的社会主义国家，至少要培养一、二百万个专家才行。
    在国民党统治时期，我们国家在文化上是十分落后的。以高等教育最发达的1947年说，也不过平均每一万个居民中有三个大学生。解放以来，由于党和人民政府的重视，我国高等教育有了迅速的发展。1955年下半年，我国高等学校在校学生数已经比1947年增加到约近二倍。六年来，我国高等学校共培养了217，900名毕业生，这个数字比旧中国50年来高等学校毕业生的总数还要多7，000余人。
    但是，我国高等教育的发展规模、速度和教育质量，现在仍然远远落后于我国社会主义建设的实际需要。我国目前平均每一万个居民中还只有五个大学生。按人口平均数来说，苏联要比我们多十六倍，波兰也要比我们多九倍。
    为适应我国社会主义建设突飞猛进的发展和迅速赶上世界先进科学的水平，培养数量足够的、优秀的科学技术专家，就需要适当地扩大高等学校培养干部的规模。今年高等学校计划招生165，550人，比第一个五年计划原定指标增加39，140人，这是完全必要的。但是现在却遇到学生来源不足的严重困难。这就要求从各方面扩大学生来源和做好考前补习工作，以保证今年高等学校招生的质量。从社会主义事业需要来看，这是一个严重的政治任务。
    要想扩大学生来源，除了动员今年应届高中毕业生全部和中等专业学校毕业生一部报考高等学校外，还必须动员一部分机关在职干部和在职小学教师自由报考高等学校。同时还要有计划地抽调部分厂矿企业和卫生系统的专业干部报考学校。但是各级党政机关、群众团体和企业管理机关的领导同志们对这一问题的认识并不都是一致的。有不少领导同志这样想：现在工作任务日益繁重，人员又要精简，人少事多，哪还有可能送干部入学？诚然，现在各方面的工作任务都很繁重，要抽调具有高中程度、身体健康、政治上进步的青年在职干部入学，的确有可能使本单位的工作暂时遭遇到一定的困难。但是，这种困难应当说是可以克服的，只要深入地检查一下，各个部门或多或少都有一些积压和浪费干部的现象。设法挤出一些干部去入学深造，并不是完全做不到的事。问题的关键是所有的领导同志都要从整个国家和整个社会主义事业的需要出发，而不是从自己一个地区、一个单位的需要出发；从不断地改进工作方法的角度出发，而不是从墨守成规的保守主义出发。
    要保证完成上述招生计划，还必须根据中央关于知识分子问题指示的精神，注意克服和防止对待社会停学待业青年入学问题上所存在着的要求过严的倾向。由于社会主义事业的胜利进展和我国国际地位的迅速提高，许多过去受了某些反动思想毒害的青年都逐渐觉醒过来，要求学习上进，为祖国和人民服务。对于这些社会上的知识青年，我们必须坚决给以入学深造和为国效力的机会，而不应该盲目地怀疑和不信任他们。我们一定要把一切可以吸收的青年和知识分子统统吸收到我们的社会主义事业中来，把他们培养成有用的人材。在这个问题上，任何对于这些青年的进步因素和潜在力估计不足的看法，都是有害的。
    我国大、中城市资本主义工商业的社会主义改造已经基本完成。在公私合营的各产业各行业中工作的还有一定数量的相当于高中毕业程度的青年职工。经过各产业各行业的统筹安排和合理调整，虽然大部分人仍要继续留在原部门工作，但也有一小部分可以鼓励报考高等学校加以培养深造。对于那些在社会主义改造过程中涌现出来的进步的工商界青年知识分子，国家也应当鼓励他们自愿报考高等学校。
    为了满足高等学校对于新生的质量要求，还必须认真做好对于在职干部、社会停学待业青年、公私合营企业的职工和工商界青年知识分子的考前补习工作。为此，各有关方面就必须给那些准备入学的在职干部（包括专业技术干部）、公私合营企业的职工以一定的学习时间，使他们根据高等学校考试大纲的要求进行三个多月的功课补习，帮助他们把过去未学的知识补学一下，把过去已学过而遗忘的知识重新复习一下，使他们增加考取的机会。去年报考的在职干部有四分之三考不取，这种情况今年必须坚决改变。
    因为有许多人离开学校较久，学业已经荒疏，今天又不能完全脱产学习，学习时间少，又要学得好，因此各级教育行政部门和大、中学校，还应当负责抽调一批教学经验较多的教师来帮助做好补习功课的教学工作。
    为着做好扩大学生来源和考前的功课补习工作，我们希望各级党委督促政府教育部门认真扩大学生来源，认真做好考前的功课补习工作和招生的准备工作，及时地批判和克服各种保守思想、本位主义以及对考生补习功课漠不关心的官僚主义作风。当地的报刊、电台、工会和青年团组织，都应当配合这一行动，协助作好这一工作。培养数量足够的优秀的高等学校毕业生、科学技术专家，是全党和全国人民当前的重要任务，我们一定不要把它看成仅仅是政府教育部门的任务。
