    Stopping the Destruction of Cultural Relics
    To the Editor:
    In October 1955, a farmer from Meidai Township, Fourth District, Tumote Banner, Pingdiquan Administrative Region, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, went up the mountain to gather firewood and discovered an ancient brick tomb in a loess gully. That evening, he and three others went to dig up the tomb and unearthed a batch of gold bottles, gold dishes, gold bowls, gold flakes, and two gold flowers about the size of chrysanthemums. They asked the Meidai Township head to write a letter of introduction and took these gold items to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Branch of the People's Bank of China in Hohhot for exchange. The personnel responsible for redemption at the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Branch did not implement the General Office of the People's Bank of China's measures for protecting cultural relics during the redemption of gold and silver ornaments. They melted down the gold items to check their purity and paid the exchangers 604 yuan.
    After this, many local farmers went to the tomb to dig. They unearthed more than 20 pottery jars, one iron sword, a batch of bronze artifacts, and one gold ring. The pottery and iron sword have been damaged by children playing with them. The bronze artifacts included two "Emperor and River Within Commander Tiger Tally," one Jiaodou (three-legged pot), two copper spoons, sheep astragalus bones, and tomb-guarding beasts. The District People's Committee had already written letters of introduction for the villagers to sell them. Fortunately, the Inner Mongolia Cultural Bureau learned of this incident, and after much effort, the relics were collected and handed over to the relics team for safekeeping.
    However, in the following 10 days or so, an average of more than 10 people still went to the tomb every day to look for things, sifting out some gold flakes and copper strips from the soil. All the tomb bricks, about 5,000 pieces, were also taken away by the farmers.
    The Inner Mongolia Cultural Bureau did not take effective measures regarding this serious incident of cultural relic destruction, but only notified the Pingdiquan Cultural and Educational Office to send someone to investigate and handle it. The person in charge of the Pingdiquan Cultural and Educational Office, in turn, used the excuse of having few people and many tasks to avoid sending anyone to investigate and handle it. This attitude is wrong. I believe that the Inner Mongolia Cultural Bureau and the Pingdiquan Party and government leading organs should immediately stop this behavior of destroying cultural relics and vigorously carry out publicity and education on protecting cultural relics through this incident.			　Wang Yuping

### 制止破坏文物的行为

    制止破坏文物的行为编辑同志：
    1955年10月，内蒙古自治区平地泉行政区土默特旗四区美岱乡一个老乡上山打柴，在黄土沟里发现了一座古代砖墓。他在当晚就同另外3个人去挖墓，结果掘出了一批金瓶、金碟、金碗、金片和两朵大小同菊花差不多的金花。他们请美岱乡乡长开了介绍信，把这些金器拿到呼和浩特市中国人民银行内蒙古自治区分行去兑换。内蒙古自治区分行负责收兑工作的人员没有执行中国人民银行总行关于在收兑金银饰品中保护文物的办法，竟把这批金器熔毁了验看成色，并给兑换人支付了价款604元。
    在这以后，当地不少农民都到墓地上去挖掘，先后共挖出陶罐20多个、铁剑一把、铜器一批和金戒一枚。陶器和铁剑已被儿童玩弄而损坏了。铜器有“皇帝与河内太守虎符”两件、鐎斗（三足锅）一件、铜勺两件和羊矩骨、镇墓兽等，区人民委员会已经开了介绍信让老乡们出卖；幸而内蒙古文化局知道了这件事情，经过不少周折，才收交文物组保存。
    但是，在以后的10多天中，每天平均仍然有10多人到墓地去找东西，从土里筛出了一些金片和铜条等。全部墓砖约5，000块，也被农民拉走了。
    对于这件破坏文物的严重事件，内蒙古文化局并没有采取有效的措施，而只是通知平地泉文教处派人调查处理；平地泉文教处负责人又借口人少事多，没有派人前往调查处理。这种态度是错误的。我认为内蒙古文化局和平地泉党政领导机关应当立即制止这种破坏文物的行为，并且通过这个事件大力进行保护文物的宣传教育工作。			　汪宇平
