Institutions of Higher Education and Scientific Research Departments in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, and other places Improve the Working and Living Conditions of Senior Intellectuals

Many institutions of higher education and scientific research departments in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, and other places are gradually improving the working and living conditions of senior intellectuals, enabling them to concentrate their time and energy on teaching and scientific research.

In order to ensure that senior intellectuals can devote six-fifths of their weekly time to teaching and scientific research, many institutions of higher education have established various systems, adjusted the time for teachers' social activities, and streamlined unnecessary meetings. The Northeast Institute of Technology also stipulates that Monday and Thursday afternoons are office hours for teachers to receive personnel from various departments, and no one is allowed to contact teachers for business at other times. Relevant administrative meetings of the Institute of Metal Research and the Institute of Forestry and Soil Science are also concentrated on Saturday afternoons.

Tsinghua University in Beijing recently established a "Reading Room Exclusively for Teachers" that can accommodate 200 people, with various technical science books and encyclopedias in Russian, English, German, French, and Japanese for teachers to prepare lessons and consult scientific literature. Peking University Library has also set up a reading room exclusively for professors, and professors can also borrow books at any time by telephone. The library of China Medical University has also added a reading room for professors and lecturers, where teachers can browse books and scientific research reference materials at any time. The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences plans to add 200 foreign journals and 3,000 foreign books this year.

The number of teaching assistants at Peking University will increase by 110, doubling the number of original teaching assistants. The departments of Fudan University have already been equipped with scientific research secretaries and are preparing to equip senior scientists with assistants and increase laboratory staff. The Institute of Forestry and Soil Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has strengthened secretarial work in various research offices to reduce some of the administrative affairs of the directors of the research offices.

Many institutions of higher education have also taken many measures to improve the living conditions of teachers. Tsinghua University in Beijing has implemented a "Preferential General Pass" system. Professors, associate professors, and others can receive priority and other appropriate care when they take the "Preferential General Pass" to the school infirmary for medical treatment, to the cafeteria for meals, and to the consumer cooperative to buy things. The Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology has also formulated many care measures for teachers' meals, as well as haircuts, medical treatment, and purchasing goods. China Medical University has increased the living space for professors and some lecturers, added necessary furniture, and is installing bathrooms. The Northeast Pharmaceutical College has set up special seats for professors and lecturers in the cafeteria. They do not have to queue up for food when eating and can order dishes according to the menu, which will be delivered by the cooks.

    北京、上海、沈阳等地高等学校和科学研究部门
    改善高级知识分子的工作和生活条件
    北京、上海、沈阳等地的许多高等学校和科学研究部门正在逐步改善高级知识分子的工作条件和生活条件，使他们能够集中时间和精力从事教学和科学研究工作。
    为了保证高级知识分子每周能有六分之五的时间用于教学和科学研究工作，许多高等学校已经订出各种制度，调整了教师们的社会活动时间，精减了不必要的会议。东北工学院还规定了每星期一、四下午是教师接待各部门人员的办公时间，其他时间不得找教师接洽事务。金属研究所和林业土壤研究所有关行政方面的会议也都集中在每星期六下午召开。
    北京清华大学最近新设了一个可容纳200人的“教师专用阅览室”，室内有各种技术科学书籍和俄、英、德、法、日文的百科全书，供教师们备课和查阅科学文献。北京大学图书馆也为教授们专辟了阅览室，教授们还可以按照电话借书办法随时借书。中国医科大学图书馆也增设了教授讲师的阅览室，教师们可随时到图书库内翻阅图书和科学研究参考资料。中国科学院上海分馆准备在今年内补订200种外文期刊和3，000种外文书籍。
    北京大学的教学辅助人员将增加110人，达到原有教学辅助人员人数的一倍。复旦大学各系已经配备了科学研究秘书，并且准备给老科学家配备助手和增加实验室人员。科学院林业土壤研究所各研究室加强了秘书工作，减轻研究室主任的一些行政事务。
    许多高等学校还采取了许多办法，改善教师们的生活条件。北京清华大学实行了“优待通用证”的办法，教授、副教授等拿着“优待通用证”到校医室看病、到食堂吃饭和到消费合作社买东西，都可以受到优先和其他适当的照顾。北京钢铁工业学院对教师们吃饭，以及理发、看病、购买东西等也订出许多项照顾的办法。中国医科大学给教授和部分讲师增加了住宅面积，增添了必要的家具，并且正在安装浴室。东北药学院在食堂里给教授讲师设立了专席，他们在吃饭时不必排队买饭菜，并可以根据菜单点菜，由炊事员送来。
