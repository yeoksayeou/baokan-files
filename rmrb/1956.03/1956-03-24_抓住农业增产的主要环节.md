Grasp the Main Links of Agricultural Production Increase
Wang Chengfang

To realize this year's agricultural production increase plan, leadership organs at all levels need to strengthen their specific leadership over agricultural production, especially grasping the main links of production increase for specific leadership. Therefore, local newspapers' propaganda on agricultural production should also tightly grasp the local main measures for increasing production, attract people's attention to these aspects, and promote leadership organs at all levels to solve these problems specifically and practically, so that the realization of the agricultural production increase plan can be reliably guaranteed.

Some newspapers are now paying attention to doing this. The Guangxi Daily is one of them. Guangxi Province plans to increase grain production by 30% this year. One of the main measures to ensure the realization of this production increase plan is to build water conservancy projects. If this work is done well, one-third of the province's frequently drought-stricken fields will be freed from the threat of drought, and the task of completing the change from one crop to two crops on four million mu of paddy fields will be guaranteed. Starting from this point, the Guangxi Daily has focused its propaganda on the construction of water conservancy projects in the recent period, especially in the period before the spring plowing. The newspaper first criticized some phenomena of neglecting water conservancy construction and the conservative thinking in leading water conservancy work. For example, in the editorial "Tap Water Conservancy Potential and Expand Water Conservancy Construction Plan," it criticized individual county party committees for being slow to arrange water conservancy work, pointing out that the reason why many leadership organs and cadres treat water conservancy work with small hands and feet is because they still view the changed situation with the eyes of a small-scale peasant economy, and cannot see that the vast number of peasants are highly enthusiastic about increasing production after joining the cooperatives and urgently demand a solution to the water conservancy problem. In this editorial and some subsequent news reports, the newspaper used many facts to illustrate that the local potential for water conservancy construction is very large. As long as the leadership organs go deep into reality and get close to the masses, they can break conservative thinking and formulate advanced and practical water conservancy construction plans. The news report "200,000 Mu - 500,000 Mu" reported that the PingLe Prefectural Party Committee originally planned to build water conservancy projects to irrigate 200,000 mu of land in the entire prefecture. However, later, the responsible cadres of the prefectural party committee went down to understand the situation and found that the peasants were very enthusiastic about building small-scale water conservancy projects, and were not only willing to contribute labor and materials, but also could solve the technical problems. In this way, they expanded the original, obviously low, plan by one and a half times, and this plan promoted the rapid development of water conservancy construction in the entire prefecture. The Guangxi Daily uses this kind of persuasive fact to help leadership organs at all levels overcome conservative thinking.

Of course, merely criticizing conservative thinking is not enough; the newspaper should also constantly discover and raise problems in practical work, and promote leadership organs at all levels and the vast number of peasants to solve these problems in a timely manner. The Guangxi Daily is doing just that. In the report "Cadres in Some Areas of Lingui Neglect Technical Guidance for Water Conservancy," the newspaper raised such a serious lesson: A total of 572 water conservancy projects were built in nine districts of Lingui County, but the quality of some projects was very poor. For example, in Bangshan Township, Yanshan District, two water conservancy projects were built, but it was only discovered that there was no water source when they were completed. In Wangjia, Damian and other townships in Dingjiang District, most of the ponds, dams and reservoirs that had been built were not up to standard due to lack of technical guidance. Why did this phenomenon occur? It turned out that many district cadres in Lingui County believed that project quality was a technical issue, and technical issues could be handled by technical personnel, without the need for supervision and guidance from the party organization. The newspaper used this fact to remind party organizations at all levels that if they do not strengthen specific leadership over water conservancy construction, and if they neglect leadership over technical work, it will cause losses to the work, waste funds, labor and materials, and time, and frustrate the enthusiasm of the masses of peasants for increasing production. Later, in response to the phenomenon in some areas of only paying attention to quantity and progress while neglecting quality and effectiveness, the Guangxi Daily published an editorial "We Must Ensure the Quality of Water Conservancy Projects." When the spring plowing season was approaching, the newspaper published an editorial "Check the Progress and Quality of Water Conservancy Construction" based on the slow progress and poor quality of water conservancy projects in some areas. These commentaries not only elaborated on the principle of achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results in water conservancy construction, but also repeatedly criticized the general leadership style of certain leadership organs that were satisfied with general political mobilization and general planning and issuing of instructions, emphasizing the importance of strengthening specific leadership and conducting in-depth inspections.

While raising problems in water conservancy construction and criticizing incorrect practices, the Guangxi Daily also paid attention to commending correct practices and introducing good work experiences to promote the backward to learn from the advanced. For example, in order to promote leadership organs at all levels to correctly arrange and organize leadership of water conservancy work, the newspaper introduced the experience of the Xincheng County Party Committee in truly grasping water conservancy work as a major production content through comprehensive planning and unified arrangements. For another example, in order to ensure project quality, the newspaper introduced the work experience of the Lantang Township Party Branch in Lingui County. This party branch used specific examples of success and failure in past water conservancy construction to conduct analysis and comparison, effectively educating cadres and the masses on ensuring project quality.

The Guangxi Daily also has shortcomings in this propaganda. The main one is that the reports on advanced experiences, especially the experiences of party organizations in mobilizing the masses and solving technical problems, are not sufficient, and even some of the existing reports are relatively simple and trivial. Despite this, their approach of paying attention to grasping the main links of production increase and carrying out specific propaganda is still worthy of reference by newspapers in various places. At present, some newspapers are only carrying out general and superficial propaganda on agricultural production increase, without attracting people's attention to the problem of first solving the main links of local production increase. Obviously, this practice should be improved quickly.

    抓住农业增产的主要环节
    王承放
    为要实现今年的农业增产计划，就需要各级领导机关加强对农业生产的具体领导，特别是抓住增产的主要环节进行具体领导。因此，各地报纸关于农业生产的宣传，也应当紧紧抓住当地的主要增产措施，把人们的注意力吸引到这方面来，推动各级领导机关具体地切实地解决这方面的问题，使农业增产计划的实现得到可靠的保证。
    现在有些报纸是注意这样做的，广西
  日报就是其中的一个。广西省今年计划增加粮食产量30％。保证这个增产计划实现的主要措施之一是兴修水利。这个工作做好了，全省三分之一经常受干旱的田地就将解除干旱的威胁，完成四百万亩稻田由一?改两?的任务也就有了保证。广西日报从这一点出发，在最近一个时期特别是春耕以前的一段时间，着重地进行了关于兴修水利的宣传。报纸首先对一些忽视兴修水利工作的现象和领导水利工作中的保守思想，提出了批评。如在“挖掘水利潜力，扩大水利兴修计划”的社论中，就批评了迟迟不去安排水利工作的个别县委，指出不少领导机关和干部对待水利工作所以小手小脚，是因为他们仍然以小农经济的眼光来看已经变化了的形势，看不到广大农民在加入合作社以后增产热情十分高涨，迫切地要求解决水利问题。报纸在这篇社论和以后的一些通讯报道中，用许多事实说明当地兴修水利的潜力很大，领导机关只要深入实际、接近群众就能打破保守思想，制定出先进的、切合实际的兴修水利的计划。“二十万亩—五十万亩”这篇通讯就报道了中共平乐地委原来计划在全专区兴建灌溉二十万亩田的水利工程，可是后来地委负责干部下去一了解情况，发现农民对兴修小型水利的情绪很高，不仅愿意出工出料，就是技术力量也可以解决，这样，他们就把原订的显然偏低的计划扩大了一倍半，这个计划推动了全专区水利建设的迅速开展。广西日报就是通过这种富有说服力的事实，来帮助各级领导机关克服保守思想。
    当然，仅仅批判保守思想还是不够的；报纸还应该不断地发现和提出实际工作中的问题，推动各级领导机关和广大农民及时地解决这些问题。广西日报正是这样做的。报纸在“临桂部分地区干部忽视水利技术指导”的报道中，提出过这样严重的教训：临桂县九个区共兴修了水利工程572处，但部分工程质量很差。如雁山区帮山乡修了两处水利工程，竣工时才发现没有水源。定江区王家、大面等乡由于缺乏技术指导，已修好的塘、坝、水库大部不合规格。为什么会发生这种现象呢？原来临桂县不少区干部认为工程质量是个技术问题，技术问题由技术人员掌握就可以了，不需要党组织的监督和指导。报纸用这个事实提醒各级党的组织：如果不加强对兴修水利的具体领导，如果忽视对技术工作的领导，就会给工作造成损失，浪费资金、工料和时间，并且锉折农民群众的增产热情。以后，广西日报又针对有些地区只顾数量和进度而忽视质量和效用的现象，发表了“一定要保证水利工程的质量”的社论。当春耕季节快要到来的时候，报纸又根据有些地区水利工程进度缓慢和质量不好的情况，发表了“检查兴修水利的进度和工程的质量”的社论。这些评论不只是阐述了兴修水利中必须坚持又多、又快、又好、又省的方针，而且一再地批判了某些领导机关满足于一般的政治鼓动和作计划、发指示的一般化领导作风，强调了加强具体领导、深入检查的重要。
    广西日报在提出兴修水利工作中的问题，批评不正确的做法的同时，也注意表扬正确的做法，介绍好的工作经验，来推动落后的向先进的看齐。例如，为了推动各级领导机关正确地安排和组织领导水利工作，报纸介绍了忻城县委经过全面规划、统一安排，把水利工作真正当作一个主要的生产内容来抓的经验。又如，为了保证工程质量，报纸介绍了临桂县兰塘乡党支部的工作经验。这个党支部用过去兴修水利中成功和失败的具体事例进行分析对比，有效地对干部和群众进行了保证工程质量的教育。
    广西日报在这个宣传中也有缺点，主要的是对先进经验特别是党组织发动群众和解决技术问题的经验报道得不够充分，就是已有的一些报道也比较简单和琐碎。尽管这样，他们这种注意抓取增产的主要环节，进行具体的宣传的做法，还是值得各地报纸参考的。目前有些报纸只是一般地、泛泛地进行农业增产的宣传，没有把人们的注意力吸引到首先解决当地增产的主要环节问题上来。显然，这种做法应当很快改进。
