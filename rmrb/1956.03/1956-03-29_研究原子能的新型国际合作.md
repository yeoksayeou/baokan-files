    New Type of International Cooperation in Atomic Energy Research
    The plenipotentiary representatives of the governments of the Soviet Union, China, Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, North Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia held a meeting in Moscow and concluded an agreement on the establishment of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. The meeting also decided that in the future, other countries willing to participate in the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, upon declaring their agreement to the terms of the signed agreement, shall become equal member states of the Joint Institute with the consent of the majority of the member states of the Institute. This marks the beginning of a new stage in international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy, following the announcement by the Soviet Council of Ministers in January of last year to provide other countries with scientific, technical, and industrial assistance in promoting research into the peaceful uses of atomic energy, and sets an example for international cooperation in the world's scientific research work. People all over the world who care about the peace and happiness of mankind are greatly delighted and encouraged by the establishment of this international organization.
    The socialist countries, headed by the Soviet Union, have not only consistently advocated that atomic energy must serve the purpose of peaceful construction and improve human welfare, but also advocated extensive international cooperation in promoting the latest development of nuclear science and technology. The Soviet Union, which is at the forefront in the theoretical research and practical application of nuclear physics, built the world's first atomic power station in 1954, and has widely applied atomic science discoveries in many fields such as steelmaking, metallurgy, agriculture, medicine, and geology, greatly developing the peaceful use of atomic energy. Recently, the Soviet Union completed the design of an atomic icebreaker and an atomic locomotive, creating new possibilities for the application of atomic energy as a power source. At the same time, from 1955 to 1956, the Soviet Union completed the design work of experimental atomic piles and elementary particle accelerators for China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Germany, providing these countries with necessary scientific and technical data on atomic piles and particle accelerators free of charge, and helping these countries train experts. Recently, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia signed an agreement on cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy. The Soviet Union has also reached an agreement with Egypt, under which the Soviet Union will help Egypt establish a nuclear physics laboratory. These selfless assistance and mutual cooperation play a great role in accelerating the development of nuclear physics science in the relevant countries and promoting the peaceful use of atomic energy.
    Research work in nuclear physics is an extremely complex and enormous task, requiring large-scale experimental and theoretical work, and requiring complex and valuable equipment, which is often beyond the technical and financial capabilities of a single country. The establishment of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research concentrates the financial and human resources of various countries, especially the Soviet government's decision to transfer all the equipment, basic buildings, and auxiliary buildings of the Institute of Nuclear Problems of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the Electrophysical Laboratory of the Soviet Academy of Sciences to the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, so that the research work of scientists from various countries can proceed smoothly from the beginning under conditions with valuable equipment. In the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, the best nuclear physicists from various countries unite and conduct joint creative research, exchange experiences, which is more conducive to the solution of theoretical and technical problems in nuclear physics. There is no doubt that the emergence of this new form of international cooperation in theoretical research and experimental research in nuclear physics will open up a brighter prospect for expanding the peaceful use of atomic energy.
    The Chinese people warmly support the establishment of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, believing that it will greatly help Chinese scientists develop the new science of atomic energy. In the overall high tide of socialist construction, the people of our country, especially scientific workers, are working hard to march towards modern science, determined to strive to bring our country's most urgently needed scientific departments close to the world's advanced level by the end of the Third Five-Year Plan period. As one of the member states of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, our government and scientists will not only assume all due obligations and contribute our strength to this international organization, but also obtain assistance from the theoretical work and experimental work of this international organization to promote our country's march towards modern science.

    研究原子能的新型国际合作
    苏联、中国、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、德意志民主共和国、朝鲜、蒙古、波兰、罗马尼亚和捷克斯洛伐克等国政府的全权代表在莫斯科举行会议，并缔结了成立联合核子研究所的协定。会议还决定，将来其他国家愿意参加联合核子研究所者，声明同意所签订的协定的条款，经研究所大多数成员国同意后即成为联合研究所的平权会员国。这是继去年一月苏联部长会议宣布在促进原子能和平用途的研究方面给予其他国家以科学、技术和工业上的帮助以后，在和平利用原子能方面进行国际合作的新阶段的开始，并为世界科学研究工作的国际合作树立了一个范例。关怀着人类的和平幸福的全世界人民，都为这个国际组织的成立感到莫大的欢欣和鼓舞。
    以苏联为首的社会主义国家，不但一贯主张原子能必须服务于和平建设、增进人类福利的目的，而且主张在促进最新的核子科学技术发展上进行广泛的国际合作。在核子物理学的理论研究和实际运用方面走在最前列的苏联，1954年就建成了全世界第一座原子能电力站，并且已经在炼钢、冶金、农业、医学和地质等许多方面广泛地应用了原子科学的发现，使原子能的和平利用有了很大发展。最近，苏联完成了原子破冰船和原子能机车的设计，又使原子能作为动力应用出现了新的可能。与此同时，从1955—1956年间，苏联为中、波、捷、罗、德等国完成实验性原子堆和基本粒子加速器的设计工作，无偿地向这些国家提供关于原子堆和粒子加速器的必要的科学技术资料，并帮助这些国家培养了专家。最近，苏联和南斯拉夫签订了关于在和平利用原子能方面进行合作的协定。苏联也和埃及达成了协议，由苏联帮助埃及建立核子物理实验所。这些无私的援助和相互合作，对于加速有关各国核子物理科学的发展和推进原子能的和平利用有极大的作用。
    核子物理学的研究工作是一个极其复杂巨大的任务，需要进行巨大规模的实验工作和理论工作，需要有复杂的贵重的设备，这往往不是某一个国家在技术和财力上力所能及的。联合核子研究所的成立集中各国的财力人力，特别是苏联政府将苏联科学院核子问题研究所和苏联科学院电气物理实验室的一切设备、基本建筑、辅助建筑等移交给联合核子研究所的决定，使各国科学家的研究工作在一开始就能够在有宝贵的设备的条件下顺利地进行。在联合核子研究所中，各国最优秀的核子物理学家团结一致地进行共同的创造性的研究，交流经验，更加有利于核子物理学理论和技术问题的解决。毫无疑问，在核子物理学的理论研究和实验研究上这种新型的国际合作形式的出现，将为扩大和平利用原子能展开更为光明的前景。
    中国人民热烈拥护联合核子研究所的成立，认为这将非常有助于中国科学家发展原子能这门新科学的工作。在社会主义建设全面高涨中，我国人民、首先是科学工作者，正在努力向现代科学进军，决心争取在第三个五年计划期末使我国最急需的科学部门能够接近世界先进水平。作为联合核子研究所的会员国之一，我国政府和科学家不仅将承担一切应有的义务，在这个国际组织中贡献我们的力量，而且还将从这个国际组织的理论工作和实验工作取得帮助，推动我国向现代科学进军。
