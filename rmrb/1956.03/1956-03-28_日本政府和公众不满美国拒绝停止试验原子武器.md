Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 25th: The Japanese and American governments simultaneously released on the 24th the U.S. note to Japan, which rejected Japan's request to cancel the U.S.'s scheduled atomic weapons test in Eniwetok Atoll in the Pacific in April.

    In its note, the U.S. emphasized that the test was "exceptionally important" to the "defense" of the U.S. and the "free world." The U.S. described its planned atomic weapons test as a general "military exercise" conducted on the high seas, and insisted that "the U.S. government should have no obligation to compensate Japan for any damages suffered as a result."

    According to Agence France-Presse, the Japanese Foreign Ministry clearly expressed its dissatisfaction with the U.S. note on the 24th. The Foreign Ministry said in its press release that the international practice of conducting military exercises on the high seas cannot be interpreted as allowing atomic tests to be conducted in areas affecting free navigation and fishing. The press release also questioned the legality of conducting the tests, as they restrict the freedom of other countries on the high seas.

    Inejiro Asanuma, Secretary-General of the Japan Socialist Party, expressed regret at the U.S. refusal of the request made by the Japanese people, who had suffered three times from atomic weapons disasters. He said that the Socialist Party will again demand a cessation of the tests.

    Isao Koide, Managing Director of the Japan Skipjack and Tuna Fisheries Association, pointed out that the U.S.'s long-term monopolization of the high seas on such a large scale is a unilateral abuse of the high seas.

    日本政府和公众不满美国拒绝停止试验原子武器
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：日本和美国两国政府在二十四日同时公布了美国给日本的照会，这个照会拒绝日本所提出的取消美国预订四月间在太平洋恩纳威托克岛举行的原子武器试验的要求。
    美国在它的照会中强调这次试验对美国和“自由世界”的“防务”“异常重要”。美国把它准备举行的原子武器试验说成是在公海上进行的一般的“军事演习”，并且硬说“美国政府应当没有赔偿日本方面由此所受损害的义务”。
    据法新社报道，日本外务省二十四日明白表示它不满意美国的照会。外务省在它的公报中说，可以在公海进行军事演习的国际惯例，不能够解释成为可以在影响到自由航行和捕鱼的区域进行原子试验。公报还怀疑进行试验是否合法，因为这种试验限制了其他国家在公海上的自由。
    日本社会党总书记浅沼稻次郎发表谈话，对美国拒绝三次遭受原子武器灾害的日本国民提出的要求，表示遗憾。他说，社会党将再次要求停止试验。
    日本鲣鲔业协会联合会常务董事小出勋男指出，美国这样长期在广大范围内独占公海是一种片面滥用公海的行为。
