A batch of senior intellectuals in Gansu, Guangdong and other provinces and Tianjin, Wuhan, Chongqing, Nanjing and other cities have been approved to join the Communist Party of China.
    On March 3, the Organization Department of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held an admission ceremony for new Party members, accepting 77 intellectuals into the Party. Among the intellectuals accepted into the Party were professors, associate professors and lecturers from universities in Lanzhou, technicians responsible for the construction of railways such as the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway and the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, as well as senior technicians and senior medical personnel leading water conservancy construction in Gansu.
    Among the 44 senior intellectuals in Guangdong who joined the Communist Party of China were Lu Yiqing, former Deputy Director of Studies at Sun Yat-sen University (currently on sick leave), and Dai Xinji, Director of the Department of Biology at Sun Yat-sen University. The Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently approved the admission of 22 intellectuals into the Party, most of whom are senior intellectuals, such as Zhang Mengshi, Director of Guangzhou Children's Hospital. Among the 47 senior intellectuals who joined the Party in Tianjin were Zhu Xianyi, President of Tianjin Medical College, and Li Jiyie, Deputy Director of the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Culture. The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Party committees of relevant systems have recently admitted 23 senior intellectuals such as professors, engineers and doctors into the Party in the past month or so. These include Hou Guangjiong, a famous soil scientist, Standing Committee Member of the Department of Biology and Earth Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and professor at Southwest Agricultural College, and Jiang Xiushang, Director of the Department of Mining at Chongqing University.
    These senior intellectuals who have been accepted into the Communist Party of China have made certain contributions and achievements in their work and possess the qualities of a Communist Party member. For example, Kong Xianwu, Director of the Department of Biology and expert in plant taxonomy at Northwest Normal College, often takes on courses that others are unwilling to take. Although he is nearly 60 years old, he volunteers to teach more than 20 hours a week. Jin Shanbao, member of the Department of Biology and Earth Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, President of Nanjing Agricultural College, and a famous wheat expert, is already 62 years old this year. In addition to carrying out scientific research, he also actively participates in various social activities, and recently often leads teachers from Nanjing Agricultural College to the suburbs of Nanjing to guide some agricultural production cooperatives in improving agricultural production technology. Hu Shidi, an engineer at the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau, led the design team to actively learn from advanced Soviet experience and successfully completed the design of the Yangtze River Bridge. Gao Shangyin, Provost of Wuhan University and a famous scientist, has been very successful in leading teachers and students in scientific research and has been successively named a model education worker and a model worker in Wuhan.

    甘肃、广东、天津、武汉等省市
    一批高级知识分子加入中国共产党
    甘肃、广东等省和天津、武汉、重庆、南京等市，分别有一批高级知识分子被批准加入中国共产党。
    3月3日，中共甘肃省委员会组织部举行了新党员入党宣誓大会，接受知识分子77人入党。被接受入党的知识分子中，有兰州市各大学的教授、副教授和讲师，有负责修建兰新路、包兰路等铁路的技术人员，还有领导甘肃水利建设的高级技术人员和高级医务人员。
    广东省参加中国共产党的44名高级知识分子中，包括中山大学前副教务长吕逸卿（现因病离职休养）、中山大学生物系主任戴辛皆等。中共广州市委员会最近也批准了22名知识分子入党，其中大部分是高级知识分子，如广州市儿童医院院长张梦石等。在天津入党的47名高级知识分子中有：天津医学院院长朱宪彝，天津市文化局副局长李霁野等。中共重庆市委员会和各有关系统的党委，在最近一个多月吸收了23名教授、工程师和医师等高级知识分子入党。其中包括著名的土壤学家、中国科学院生物学地学部常务委员、西南农学院教授侯光炯，重庆大学采矿系系主任姜修尚等。
    这些被接受参加中国共产党的高级知识分子，在自己所担负的工作中有一定的贡献和成就，具备了共产党员的条件。如西北师范学院生物系主任、植物分类学专家孔宪武，常常担任别人不愿担任的课程，自己已经是近60岁的人，但自愿每周授课20多小时。中国科学院生物学地学学部委员、南京农学院院长、著名的小麦专家金善宝，今年已经62岁。他在进行科学研究工作之外，还积极参加各种社会活动，最近又经常带领南京农学院的教师到南京市郊区指导一些农业生产合作社提高农业生产技术。武汉长江大桥工程局工程师胡世悌，曾领导设计人员积极学习苏联先进经验，出色地完成了长江大桥的设计工作。武汉大学教务长、著名的科学家高尚荫，领导全校师生进行科学研究工作很有成绩，曾先后被评选为武汉市的模范教育工作者和劳动模范。
