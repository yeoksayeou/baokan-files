    The Advancing Footprints of Children's Literature
    ——After Reading the "Selected Children's Literature" Compiled by the Chinese Writers Association——
    Liang Ruhuai
    The "Selected Children's Literature" compiled by the Chinese Writers Association is another review of our country's children's literature creation since the National Children's Literature and Art Creation Awards held at the end of 1953. It marks the advancing footprints of children's literature in the past two years.
    From this collection, we can see that the themes of juvenile and children's literature have expanded. The writers' pens take us out of the school gate, enabling us to begin to contact and understand our new generation in a broader world of life and from many different perspectives. We can not only see the children in cities and villages that we often saw before, but also come into contact with the children by the sea and in the Great Northern Wilderness that we rarely saw before; we not only see the young Liu Jixin who is already called a "small member of the cooperative," but also see the five-year-old Xiao Song who is still in the nursery; we not only come into contact with children who live happily under the sunshine, but also see children who have grown up in wind, rain and war. In these works, the authors use their colorful pens to depict the real images of vivid and lively children.
    We can see Han Meimei, who has been familiar to the majority of young children. From this pig-raising girl, the children understand how to treat life and what it means to be promising. The question raised by the novel "Han Meimei" is a question of common concern to tens of millions of children. This question is correctly answered in the writer's enthusiastic praise for labor and the profound depiction of the inner activities of the young protagonist. Therefore, this novel has the infectious power to guide young people to cross an important juncture in life and embark on the road to prosperity. Similarly, we can also see how another group of children leap and participate in the beautiful cause of building their hometowns. Their hearts are filled with excitement and pride in labor and the beautiful prospects of their hometowns. They use their own hands to ensure that their labor can also get five points; they practice rice cutting in the thatch at night, gradually shifting the excitement of catching crickets to the labor of agricultural production cooperatives. In the boundless fertile soil of the Great Northern Wilderness, Xiao Yuanzi, who came to the farm with his father, watched the novel things around him with infinite enthusiasm. He quickly fell in love with this "large prairie hundreds of miles wide" and worried, "When I grow up and can drive a tractor, maybe Lao Li and the others will have finished reclaiming the Great Northern Wilderness, what should I do then?" Here, we can hear the footsteps of the growth of socialist new people and the irrepressible beating of their hearts.
    We also deeply love Xiao Wang ("Me and Xiao Rong") and Xiao Rong, their childhood was spent in arduous and cruel struggles. In the struggle, they experienced many disasters and pains, remembered the endless "unresolved hatred," and grew up under the care and nurturing of the Party and the People's Army. The revolutionary war is a great furnace that has tempered many young warriors! We also saw the brave actions of Lin Dongxiu and the Young Pioneers on Dongshan Island, and saw how San Shaozi, Xiao Dou'er and Liu Shihai fought together with the adults against the hidden counter-revolutionaries. In these sharp struggles, the strong patriotism, courage, and resourcefulness of the new generation were fully demonstrated.
    What is lacking is that there are still very few works written specifically for children that reflect industrial construction, national defense, and transportation, etc. This collection is still blank in this area. This blank needs to be filled quickly.
    The genre of children's literature has also developed. The collection includes fairy tales and fairy tale poems that have been enthusiastically welcomed by young readers in recent years. Although the two fairy tale poems and three fairy tales each have some similarities in theme, they all open up new fields for fairy tale creation with different styles, structures, and colors. Especially in the case that fairy tales are not very developed now, this part can be regarded as a fairly good harvest.
    Compared with novels and fairy tales, there are not many good poems written for young children, poems that can truly express the surging emotions of young children and are also beautiful. Children like poetry so much, and they like poetry recitation activities so much. In every school, we will encounter not a few, but dozens or hundreds of poetry lovers. However, they recite and recite, always only those few poems (including foreign works such as "The Fisherman and the Golden Fish"). This is truly a severe and ruthless test: good poems will always be remembered by children and often hung on their lips; bad poems are like raindrops falling on the water, flashing for a moment and then leaving no trace. Although the collection also includes a few, it seems relatively thin and shabby when compared with another "Poetry Selection". Here, we cannot but make more demands on poets - including poets who write poems for adults. If you can more deeply familiarize yourself with and study the lives of young children, make close friends with some children, and explore what our successors are thinking and how they are treating the lives around them, you will find countless poetic themes and poetic emotions. Their lives themselves are full of poetry.
    This collection also demonstrates one of the biggest features of the field of children's literature in recent years: a large number of new authors have emerged. More than half of the authors in the collection are newcomers on the literary front. They are either selected for their debut works, or have only appeared in the field of children's literature in the past two years. Among them are teachers, counselors, students, and staff members of the League organizations and other state agencies. This group of energetic authors is undoubtedly the new force in the children's literature creation team.
    Naturally, what excites us is not just the discovery of some new names, but more importantly, the dazzling brilliance and exciting power emitted by these works themselves. For example, in "Me and Xiao Rong", the young author shaped the positive heroic images of two young children, Xiao Wang and Xiao Rong. They were only fifteen and twelve years old, but they went in and out of the enemy's blockade line, delivering confidential documents and intelligence. The author used infinite affection to describe the voices, appearances and smiles of these two children and their inner worlds, and carved out the typical brave, resourceful, optimistic, enthusiastic and lively character of the young children in the anti-Japanese base areas. Anyone who has read this novel, who can not be deeply attracted by this story and its many vivid characters, and follow them to rejoice and grieve together? Many young authors in this collection have shown their familiarity with the lives of young children, their heartfelt love for young children, and their fresh and simple style.
    Generally speaking, these new authors have close ties with the lives of young children. Through these works, we can also feel their deep feelings for the children. Their artistic successes, such as the strong atmosphere of life, the arrangement of tense and interesting plots, the use of refined and vivid children's language, etc., are also inseparable from these. And all of this also refutes the erroneous argument that writing children's literature does not require life or skills.
    The newcomers in the children's literature garden are exciting and encouraging, but we also have to make expectations of the writers. It should be said that in recent years, especially since last winter, under the call of the Party Central Committee, writers have begun to attach importance to writing for young children. The phenomenon that Gorky once criticized as "seeming to think that describing children and writing for children is degrading oneself" has changed a lot. However, in order to prevent a gust of wind, it still seems necessary to mention it again. A part of the authors in this collection are the names of old writers, and their highly skilled works have become a valuable harvest in the garden of juvenile and children's literature, but this is too little after all. We have every reason to expect that this year's collection will have more works by old writers!

    儿童文学前进的脚印
    ——中国作家协会编选的“儿童文学选”读后——
    梁汝怀
    中国作家协会编选的“儿童文学选”，是在1953年年底举行的全国四年来儿童文艺创作评奖以后，对于我国儿童文学创作的又一次检阅，它标志着儿童文学在近两年来前进的脚印。
    从这本选集里，我们可以看到：少年儿童文学的题材扩大了。作家们的笔带着我们走出学校的大门，使我们能够开始在比较广阔的生活世界里、从许多不同的侧面来接触和认识我们的新的一代。我们不但能看到以前所常见到的城市和农村的孩子，也接触到以前所不常见到的海边和北大荒的孩子；不但看到已经被称为“小社员”的少年刘吉新，也看到还在托儿所的五岁的小松；不但接触了在阳光拂照下幸福地生活的孩子，也看到在风雨和战火里锻炼成长的孩子。在这些作品里，作者们用他们的多彩的笔描绘了一个个生动、活泼的孩子的真实形象。
    我们可以看到那个已经被广大少年儿童所熟悉的韩梅梅，从这个养猪姑娘身上，孩子们懂得了怎样对待生活，什么才叫有出息。小说“韩梅梅”所提出的问题，是上千万的孩子共同关心的问题，这个问题在作家的对劳动的充满热情的歌颂和对少年主人公内心活动的深刻的描写里，得到正确的解答。因之这篇小说就具有引导少年们怎样跨过人生的一个重要关口、踏上康庄大道的感染力量。同样，我们也可以看到另外一批孩子们怎样地跳跃着参加建设家乡的美好的事业。在他们的心头，洋溢着对劳动、对家乡绚丽远景的兴奋和自豪感。他们用自己的双手，使自己的劳动也能得到五分；他们黑夜里在茅草地里练习割稻的手艺，把捉蟋蟀的兴奋逐渐转移到农业生产合作社的劳动上。在北大荒一望无垠的沃土上，跟着爸爸到农场来的小元子无限热情地注视着周围的新奇的事物，他很快就爱上了这块“方圆几百里宽的大草原”，并且担心“等我长大了能开拖拉机的时候，也许老李他们就把北大荒开完了，那可怎么办呀”。在这里，我们能听到社会主义新人成长的脚步声和遏制不住的内心的跳动。
    我们也深深地爱上了小王（“我和小荣”里的“我”）和小荣，他们的童年是在艰苦残酷的斗争里度过的，在斗争里，他们经历许多灾难和痛苦，记住了说不完的“没有了结的仇恨”，在党和人民军队的关怀和抚养下长大。革命战争是座大洪炉，锻炼了多少年青的勇士！我们也看见林东秀和东山岛上的少先队员们的勇敢行动，看到了三苕子、小豆儿和刘士海他们怎样跟大人们一起，同暗藏的反革命分子作斗争。在这些尖锐的斗争里，新的一代的强烈的爱国主义精神，勇敢、机智的品质，得到了充分的表现。
    不足的是专为儿童写的反映工业建设、国防和交通运输业等等方面的作品，现在还很少。在这本选集里还是一个空白。这个空白需要赶快弥补。
    儿童文学的体裁也有了发展。选集里收集了近年来为少年儿童读者所热烈欢迎的童话和童话诗。虽然，两首童话诗和三篇童话在主题上各自都有些类似之处，但它们都以不同的风格、结构和色彩为童话创作开辟些新的园地，特别是童话现在还不大发达的情况下，这一部分可算得是相当好的收获了。
    比起小说和童话来，为少年儿童写的诗，好的、真正能表达少年儿童的汹涌澎湃的感情而又优美的诗，还不多。孩子们是那么喜欢诗，那么喜欢诗朗诵活动，我们在每个学校里都会碰到不是几个而是几十、上百的诗歌爱好者。然而他们朗诵来、朗诵去，总是那么几首诗（其中还包括像“渔夫和金鱼的故事”一类的外国作品）。这真是严厉的也是无情的考验：好的诗孩子们总会记住，常常挂在嘴上；不好的诗就像雨点落在水上，闪一下就再没有痕迹。选集里虽也列入了几首，但是只要同另一本“诗选”比一下，就显得比较单薄和寒伧。在这里，我们不能不对诗人们——包括写成年人读的诗的诗人们多提些要求。如果你们能够更加深入地去熟悉和研究少年儿童的生活，多同一些孩子做个知心朋友，去探索一下我们的接班人在想些什么，怎样在对待周围的生活，你们就会发现有无数的诗的题材，诗的感情。他们的生活本身里，就是充满了诗的。
    这个选集还表现了近年来儿童文学领域里的一个最大的特色：新的作者大批地出现。选集的一半以上的作者，都是文学战线上的新人，他们或者是以自己的处女作入选，或者是近两年来才在儿童文学的园地里出现。他们之中有教师、辅导员，有学生，也有团的组织及其他国家机关的工作人员，这批朝气蓬勃的作者，无疑地是儿童文学创作队伍的生力军。
    自然，使我们感到兴奋的，还不只是在于发现一些新的名字，更重要的，是这些作品本身所发出来的耀眼的光彩和激动人心的力量。例如在“我和小荣”里，年青的作者塑造了两个少年儿童的正面英雄形象小王和小荣。他们只是十五岁和十二岁的孩子，却出入敌人封锁线，传递着机密的文件和情报。作者用无限的深情描绘这两个孩子的声容笑貌和他们的内心世界，刻划了作为抗日根据地少年儿童的典型的勇敢、机智、乐观而又热情、活泼的性格。凡是读了这篇小说的人，有谁能不被这个故事和它里面的许多活生生的人物形象所深深吸引，并且跟着他们一同欢乐、一同悲戚的呢？这本选集的许多年青的作者们都表现了他们对少年儿童生活的熟悉，对少年儿童的由衷的爱，和他们的清新、朴素的风格。
    一般地说，这些新的作者都是同少年儿童的生活有着密切的联系的，透过这些作品，我们也能感受到他们对孩子们的深厚的感情。他们的艺术上的成功，例如浓郁的生活气息、紧张有趣的情节的安排、精炼生动的儿童语言的运用等等，也都是同这些分不开的。而所有这些，也就驳斥了那种认为写儿童文学作品无需生活也无需技巧的错误论调。
    儿童文学园地的新人使人兴奋鼓舞，但是我们同时也还要对作家们提出希望。应该说，近年来，特别是去年冬季以来，在党中央的号召下，作家们已经开始重视为少年儿童写作了，像高尔基曾经批评过的“仿佛认为描写儿童和为儿童写作是降低自己身分的事情”的现象，有了不小的改变。但是，为了防止一阵风，似乎仍然有再提一下的必要。这本选集的作者里有一部分老作家的名字，他们的具有高度技巧的作品，成为少年儿童文学园地的一份宝贵的收获，但是，这毕竟太少。我们完全有理由期望今年的选集中，能有更多的老作家的作品！
