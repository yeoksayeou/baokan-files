Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch from New York: An anti-discrimination movement against black people is vigorously developing across the United States.

The central organization of the black movement, the "National Association for the Advancement of Colored People" (NAACP), will hold a National Civil Rights Conference in Washington from March 4th to 6th. According to the NAACP, more than 50 black and white national organizations have joined in initiating this conference. In some of its recent statements, the NAACP pointed out that due to the surge of the anti-discrimination movement against black people, racists have strengthened their persecution of black people. However, the NAACP is determined to meet this challenge, and the current battle cry of the black masses is: "Achieve liberation before 1963."

American black people, with the support of upright white people, are actively fighting in various places, demanding the earnest implementation of the U.S. Supreme Court's decisions in 1954 and 1955 to abolish racial segregation in schools and public places. These decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court were made under the strong pressure of the anti-discrimination movement against black people and are considered a major victory for the black movement. However, American racists, including the governors and members of Congress of many southern states, refuse to implement these decisions. Racists are also intensifying their use of lynching, assassination, and arrest to treat black organizations and black fighters who insist on opposing racial segregation.

According to a Reuters report, fighters striving for equal rights for approximately 20 million black people in the United States have now "moved from defense to offense" in their long-term struggle against racists. In many states, they are launching movements to protest the persecution of racists and demand the implementation of the Supreme Court's decisions. United Press reporter Montreal believes that black people and racists are currently engaged in a "battle over the issue of segregation with the same anger that led to the Civil War."

Black people have demonstrated tenacious fighting spirit in their struggle against racial discrimination. In Montgomery, Alabama, the struggle of approximately 60,000 black people to resist the discriminatory white bus company has persisted for three months. Reverend King, who is leading this struggle, said at a mass rally on February 27th that black people are determined to persist in this boycott struggle to the end, "We are not afraid to go to jail, we are not afraid to serve prison sentences, we are not afraid to sacrifice our lives if necessary, because we are improving the world." The struggle of black people in Montgomery has received strong support from black people everywhere. Some famous pastors in New York City have issued appeals calling on black people across the country to stop working and stop attending classes for one hour on March 28th to protest the police authorities' arrest of approximately 100 leaders of the black people's struggle in Montgomery. This call has been enthusiastically responded to by black people everywhere.

Dozens of national organizations mainly composed of white people, such as the "American Civil Liberties Union," the "American Council on Human Rights," the "Americans for Democratic Action," the "American Bar Association," and the "American Baptist Convention," have expressed their support for the anti-discrimination struggle against black people.

The American Communist Party's organ publication, "Political Affairs," recently published articles pointing out that the struggle against racial discrimination is of great significance because it is an important part of the struggle to complete the bourgeois democratic revolution in the American South, where black people are enslaved. At the same time, it is an important component of the American people's struggle for democratic freedom and to improve their lives. "Political Affairs" called on American progressive forces to actively participate in and lead this struggle, exert the greatest influence to promote the unity of black people's struggles, strive for the greatest support from the labor movement and white masses for this struggle, and deepen this struggle in political and economic aspects.

    美国人民展开反对歧视黑人的运动
    新华社2日讯　纽约消息：美国国内反对歧视黑人的运动正在全国范围内蓬勃开展。
    黑人运动的中心组织“全国有色人种协进会”将在3月4日到6日在华盛顿召开全国民权大会。据协进会宣布，已经有50多个黑人和白人全国性的组织参加发起这个大会。协进会在它最近发表的一些声明中指出，由于反对歧视黑人的运动的高涨，种族主义者加强了对黑人的迫害，但是协进会怀着坚定的决心迎接这个挑战，黑人群众目前的战斗口号是：“在1963年以前获得解放”。
    美国黑人群众目前正在正直的白人群众支持下在各地积极进行斗争，要求认真执行美国最高法院在1954年和1955年相继作出的取消学校和公共场所中的种族隔离的决定。美国最高法院的这些决定是在反对歧视黑人的运动的强大压力下作出的，被认为是黑人运动的一个重大胜利。但是美国的种族主义者，包括美国南部许多个州的州长和国会议员拒绝执行这些决定。种族主义者并且加紧用私刑、暗杀和逮捕等手段来对待坚持反对种族隔离的黑人组织和黑人战士。
    据路透社消息说，争取美国约2，000万黑人的平等权利的战士在他们反对种族主义者的长期斗争中目前已经“从防守转入了攻势”，在许多州里，他们正发动运动，抗议种族主义者的迫害和要求实现最高法院的决定。合众社记者蒙特利尔认为，黑人和种族主义者目前正在围绕着隔离问题展开一场“其忿怒情绪同导致南北战争的忿怒情绪一样的战斗”。
    黑人群众在他们反对种族歧视的斗争中表现了顽强的斗志。在亚拉巴马州的蒙哥马利市，约6万黑人抵制歧视黑人的白人公共汽车公司的斗争已经坚持了3个月。领导这个斗争的金牧师2月27日在一个群众大会上说，黑人们决心把这个抵制斗争坚持到底，“我们不怕进监狱，我们不怕服徒刑，我们不怕在必要时牺牲我们的生命，因为我们是在改善世界”。蒙哥马利市黑人的斗争得到了各地黑人的大力支援。纽约市一些著名牧师已经发出呼吁，号召全国黑人在3月28日停止工作和停止上课一小时，以抗议警察当局逮捕约100名领导蒙哥马利市黑人斗争的领袖。这个号召得到了各地黑人的热烈响应。
    几十个主要由白人组成的全国性组织，例如“美国民权保障联盟”，“美国人权委员会”，“美国人民主行动协会”，“美国律师协会”，“美国浸礼大会”等都已经表示支持反对歧视黑人的斗争。
    美国共产党机关刊物“政治评论”最近发表一些文章指出，反对种族歧视的斗争具有重大的意义，因为它是争取在奴役黑人的美国南部完成资产阶级民主革命的斗争的一个重要部分，同时又是美国人民争取民主自由、要求改善生活的斗争的一个重要组成部分。“政治评论”号召美国进步力量积极参加和领导这个斗争，发挥最大的影响来促进黑人的战斗的团结，争取工人运动和白人群众对这个斗争给予最大的支持，并且使这个斗争在政治和经济各个方面深入下去。
