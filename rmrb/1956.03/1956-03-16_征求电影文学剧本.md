    Seeking Film Literature Screenplays
    The Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association recently passed a "Resolution on Strengthening the Creation of Film Literature Screenplays" and decided to conduct a national film literature screenplay solicitation and award program in conjunction with the Ministry of Culture.
    The period for soliciting film literature screenplays is from March this year to the end of March next year.
    Submitted film literature screenplays are limited to feature films and are required to reflect the new life of the Chinese people in socialist construction, the revolutionary struggles led by the Chinese Communist Party in various historical periods, Chinese history and folk legends, and adaptations of famous Chinese classical and modern literary works. Selected screenplays will be divided into three grades, and bonuses of 3,000 to 8,000 yuan will be awarded according to the grade.
    The "Resolution on Strengthening the Creation of Film Literature Screenplays" points out that the creation of film screenplays is not yet vigorous enough, and the reason is that most writers have not truly recognized the importance of film literature, and many writers overemphasize the particularity of film art and dare not try. The resolution calls on writers across the country to study hard, work actively, and create more and better film literature screenplays to ensure the continuous development and prosperity of film art.

    征求电影文学剧本
    中国作家协会主席团最近通过了“关于加强电影文学剧本创作的决议”，并且决定会同文化部在全国范围内进行电影文学剧本征稿评奖。
    征求电影文学剧本的期限是从今年3月起到明年3月底止。
    应征的电影文学剧本只限于故事片，要求能够反映中国人民在社会主义建设中的新生活、中国共产党所领导的各个历史时期的革命斗争、中国历史和民间传说以及改编中国古典文学和现代文学名著。应征入选的剧本分为三等，将按等级分别给予3，000元到8，000元的奖金。
    “关于加强电影文学剧本创作的决议”中指出，目前电影剧本的创作还不旺盛，原因是大多数的作家还没有真正认识到电影文学的重要性，不少作家过分地强调了电影艺术的特殊性而不敢尝试。决议号召全国作家，努力钻研，积极劳动，创作出更多、更好的电影文学剧本，以保证电影艺术的不断发展和繁荣。
