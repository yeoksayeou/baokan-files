Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade Dispatch: The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia concluded in Belgrade on the 14th, after a two-day meeting.

    At the morning session on the 14th, Stanbolić, a member of the Executive Committee of the Central Committee, delivered a report on youth education work and the tasks of the League of Communists in this regard. He said that the People's Youth League is the most important political and educational organization for young people. The People's Youth League has more than 1.17 million members. It has launched extensive activities in culture, education, sports, and recreational life, and has expanded several social organizations engaged in various activities.
    Stanbolić pointed out that neglecting political and ideological work is a weakness in the work of organizations at all levels of the People's Youth League.
    Stanbolić emphasized that it is necessary to fundamentally overcome the conservatism that many communists have in absorbing young people to participate in autonomous institutions and electing young people to leadership positions in the League of Communists and other organizations. The vast majority of young people certainly accept the country's socialist path of development, because young people believe that this path is a guarantee of their future and a guarantee of the realization of their goals.
    After Stanbolić delivered his report, the plenary session held a discussion. Kardelj, the secretary of the Executive Committee of the Central Committee, also spoke during the discussion.

    南共产主义者联盟中央全会闭幕
    据新华社讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社贝尔格莱德讯：南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟中央委员会全体会议在举行两天会议后，14日在贝尔格莱德闭幕。
    在14日上午会议上，中央委员会执行委员会委员斯坦鲍利奇作了有关青年教育工作和共产主义者联盟在这方面的任务的问题的报告。他说，人民青年联盟是最重要的青年的政治和教育组织。人民青年联盟共有117万多盟员。它在文化、教育、运动和文娱生活方面展开了广泛的活动，并且扩大了若干从事各种活动的社会组织。
    斯坦鲍利奇指出，忽视政治思想工作是人民青年联盟各级组织的工作中的一个弱点。
    斯坦鲍利奇强调说，必须从根本上克服许多共产主义者在吸收青年参加自治机构和选举青年人参加共产主义者联盟和其他组织的领导机构方面所存在的保守主义。绝大多数青年肯定接受国家的社会主义发展道路，因为青年认为这条道路是他们的前途的保证和实现他们的目的的保证。
    在斯坦鲍利奇作了报告后，全体会议进行了讨论。中央委员会执行委员会书记卡德尔也在讨论中发了言。
