Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 7th Dispatch: Bonn dispatch: The West German Federal Parliament passed a law on March 6 in its second and third readings regarding the amendment of the constitution—adding military clauses to the constitution; on the same day, the so-called "Soldiers Law" was also passed in its second reading.

The law amending the constitution includes 14 amendments and supplements to the constitution, stipulating that the Federal Parliament can make decisions to declare war and declare a state of emergency, and stipulating the powers of the Minister of Defense, etc. Through the amendment of the constitution, the Adenauer government will be able to implement large-scale conscription in the future, which clears the legal obstacles for West Germany's re-militarization; and the passage of the "Soldiers Law" will allow the Adenauer government to immediately recruit 150,000 soldiers and officers as the backbone of the 12 West German regular divisions (500,000 men) stipulated in the Paris Agreement.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 9th Dispatch: Bonn dispatch: The West German Federal Parliament's passage of the constitutional amendment bill and the "Soldiers Law" bill, two military legislations that accelerate West German militarization, immediately aroused strong protests from people in various parts of West Germany.

On March 7, citizens of Düsseldorf marched through the streets holding banners and flags, shouting slogans. They called on people from all walks of life to strive for peace, for negotiations instead of shooting, and for building children's playgrounds instead of manufacturing arms. Residents of other cities also expressed their protests in various forms.

    西德各地人民强烈抗议军国主义化
    据新华社柏林7日电　波恩消息：西德联邦议院在3月6日二读和三读通过了一项关于修改宪法——在宪法中增加军事条款——的法律；同一天，又二读通过了所谓“士兵法”。
    修改宪法的法律包括14项对宪法的修改和补充，其中规定联邦议院可以作出宣战和宣布非常状态的决定并且规定了国防部长的权力等。通过对宪法的修改，阿登纳政府就有可能在以后实施大规模征兵，这就为西德的重新军国主义化扫清了法律上的障碍；而“士兵法”的通过将允许阿登纳政府立即募集士兵和军官15万人，以作为巴黎协定所规定成立的12个西德正规师（50万人）的骨干。
    据新华社柏林9日电　波恩消息：西德联邦议院通过修改宪法案和“士兵法”案这两项加速西德军国主义化的军事立法后，立即激起了西德各地人民的强烈抗议。
    3月7日，杜塞尔多夫的市民们举着标语牌和旗帜，高呼着口号，在街道上游行。他们号召各界人民为争取和平、为举行谈判而不进行射击、为建筑儿童游戏场而不制造军火而进行斗争。其他城市的居民也通过各种形式表示了抗议。
