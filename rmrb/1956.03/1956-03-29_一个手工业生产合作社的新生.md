    A New Life for a Handicraft Production Cooperative
    By Our Correspondent Gu Weijin
    The Litou (Plowshare) Cast Goods Handicraft Production Cooperative in Chengguan Town, Echeng County, Hubei Province, was established in 1953. In its early days, due to the leadership's relaxed oversight and the manipulation of the board of directors by bad elements, the cooperative members' notions of employment, as well as their selfishness, conservatism, and laxity, were not transformed. Production management was chaotic; no one cared about the quantity or quality of production, and the scrap rate frequently reached 15% to 30%.
    In April 1954, relevant leading bodies organized a work team to help the cooperative rectify. The work team educated the members on the general line, organized them to study the cooperative's charter, and exposed and criticized past mistakes and shortcomings. This enabled the members to understand that if the cooperative wanted to develop, it must earnestly implement the policy of serving agricultural production, and initially establish the idea of regarding the cooperative as their home.
    The work team helped the cooperative bring production into the orbit of the national plan. However, the cooperative's production management was very chaotic; production was not divided into groups, labor was not divided, there was no establishment of a responsibility system, and there was no mutual supervision, which could not meet the requirements of planned production. To solve this contradiction, the work team helped them divide into groups, clarify responsibilities, and promote assembly line operation and quota management. As a result, the members felt that production had a clear direction, and they were more motivated. In just two or three months, the cooperative's output increased by 72.4% compared to before, quality improved by 62.5%, costs decreased by 11.6%, and the members' wage income increased by 50%.
    To consolidate the achievements, the work team also helped the cooperative establish necessary systems such as a production responsibility system, product inspection system, and financial management system. It mobilized the members to remove the bad elements from the board of directors, democratically elect a new board of directors, and establish Party and League organizations.
    Starting from September of last year, the cooperative's board of directors, according to the instructions from higher authorities, actively mobilized the members to carry out a regular movement to increase production and practice economy. Youth League member Luo Qingfu created the "Standard Furnace Lining Method," which shortened working time by 35%, increased monthly output by more than 40%, and saved a large amount of raw materials, reducing costs by 12.8%. To improve product quality, each production group established a scrap inspection system before and after the furnace. In the movement to increase production and practice economy, the scrap rate of plowshares was reduced from 30% before rectification to 1%, the scrap rate of other products was reduced from 15% to 3%, the rate of substandard products was reduced from 40% to 6%, product costs were reduced by 28.3%, and the selling price was reduced by 21.3%. The cooperative regularly sends people out to investigate the masses' demands for products, and based on their opinions, the types of products have been increased from more than twenty to more than eighty. In order to better serve rural production and establish credit, the cooperative has formulated four measures to guarantee the quality of products sold outside the region: 1. If the other party has a large backlog of substandard or defective products and it is inconvenient to transport them back due to the long distance, the cooperative will send a special person to repair them, and the cost will be borne by the cooperative; 2. If the other party has only a small backlog of substandard or defective products and the cost of sending someone to repair them is too high, the other party will hire someone locally to repair them, and the cost will be borne by the cooperative; 3. If the other party has a very small backlog of substandard or defective products, they will be sold at a reduced price through mutual consultation; 4. For defective products from other regions, the cooperative will exchange them all and bear the transportation costs.
    With the development of the movement to increase production and practice economy and the improvement of business attitudes, the cooperative's product sales have opened up. Previously, the cooperative's products were only sold in a few counties, but now they are sold in twenty-five counties and are also sold to Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Anhui and other provinces.
    On the basis of balancing production, supply, and sales, production is constantly improving. In 1953 (before rectification), the average monthly output was 29,000 jin. In 1954 (after rectification), the average monthly output was 40,000 jin. In 1955, the average monthly output was 100,000 jin. Before rectification, the cooperative lost all its shares and bank loans, totaling more than 2,000 yuan. Now, not only has it earned back this money, but it also has a surplus of more than 10,000 yuan. The cooperative has added semi-mechanized production tools such as blowers, iron melting furnaces, molds, and lathes.

    一个手工业生产合作社的新生
    本报记者　古维进
    湖北省鄂城县城关镇犁头铸货手工业生产合作社，在1953年建立初期，由于领导机关放松领导，理监事会被坏分子操纵，社员们的雇佣观点和自私、保守、散漫等思想也没有得到改造；生产管理很混乱，生产多少，质量好坏，都没人过问，废品率经常达15％到30％。
    1954年4月，有关领导方面组织工作组帮助这个社进行整顿。工作组对社员进行了总路线的教育，组织社员学习社章，揭露和批判过去的错误和缺点，使社员懂得合作社要想发展，必须认真执行为农业生产服务的方针，初步树立了以社为家的思想。
    工作组帮助合作社把生产纳入国家计划轨道。但是，合作社的生产管理很混乱，生产不分组，干活不分工，不建立责任制，互相不监督，不能满足计划生产的要求。为了解决这个矛盾，工作组又帮助他们划分小组，明确责任，推行流水作业法和定额管理等。这样，社员们感到生产有了头绪，生产也有了劲头，仅仅两三个月，这个社的产量就比以前提高了72.4％，质量提高了62.5％，成本降低了11.6％，社员的工资收入提高了50％。
    为了巩固已得的成绩，工作组还帮助合作社建立了生产责任制、产品检验制、财务管理制等必要的制度，发动社员把理监事会的坏分子清除出去，民主选举了新的理监事会，并建立了党、团组织。
    从去年九月开始，社理监事会根据上级的指示，积极发动社员开展了经常性的增产节约运动。青年团员罗庆甫创造了“标准糊炉法”，使工作时间缩短35％，月产量提高40％多；并节约了大批原材料，成本降低了12.8％。为了提高产品质量，各生产小组建立了炉前炉后的废品检查制度。在增产节约运动中，犁头废品率由整社前的30％降低到1％，其他产品的废品率也由15％降低到3％，次品率由40％降低到6％，产品成本降低了28.3％，售价降低了21.3％。合作社经常派人出去调查群众对产品的要求，根据群众的意见，把产品种类由二十多种增加到八十多种。合作社为了更好地为农村生产服务，树立信用，订出保证外销产品质量的四项办法：一、凡对方积压次废品较多，路途遥远不便运回的，由合作社派专人前往修理，费用由合作社负担；二、对方所积压的次废品不多，合作社派人去修理费用过大，则由对方就地雇人修理，费用由合作社负担；三、对方积压的次废品极少，经双方协商减价出售；四、外地区的废品，合作社全部调换，并且负担运费。
    随着增产节约运动的开展和经营态度的改进，合作社的产品销路打开了。以前合作社的产品只销售几个县，现在已经销售二十五个县，还远销江苏、江西、安徽等省。
    在产供销平衡的基础上，生产不断提高。1953年（整社前）每月平均产量二万九千斤，1954年（整社后）每月平均产量是四万斤，1955年每月平均产量十万斤。整社以前，合作社赔掉全部股金和银行贷款共二千多元，现在不仅赚回这笔钱，还盈余一万多元。社里添制了鼓风机、化铁炉、模子、车机等半机械化的生产工具。
