Two Young Erhu Players
	Two young Erhu players—six-and-a-half-year-old Tang Shiwen and five-and-a-half-year-old Xie Yangui, recently participated in the Second Jiangxi Provincial Folk Art Performance and Exhibition Conference. Their correct bowing technique, fingering, pitch recognition ability, and performance skills have been praised by music workers in Jiangxi Province.
	Tang Shiwen and Xie Yangui are both the sons of farmers. They have only been learning to play the Erhu for a little over a year, and now they can both play about fifty tunes. Xie Yangui also frequently accompanies the amateur opera troupe in his village. He has a very strong memory, and he can play the pieces he hears at the performance and exhibition conference in a short time. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    两个幼年二胡手
    两个幼年二胡手——六岁半的唐诗文和五岁半的谢炎桂，最近参加了江西省第二届民间艺术观摩会演大会，他们正确的弓法、指法、辨音能力和演奏技巧，得到江西省的音乐工作者的赞赏。
    唐诗文和谢炎桂都是农民的儿子，学习拉二胡只有一年多时间，现在都能拉五十来支曲子。谢炎桂还经常给乡里的业余剧团伴奏。他的记忆力很强，在观摩会演大会上听到的节目，一会儿就能拉起来。（据新华社讯）
