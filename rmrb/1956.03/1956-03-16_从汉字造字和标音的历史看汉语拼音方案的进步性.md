From the Perspective of Chinese Character Creation and Phonetic Notation History: The Progressiveness of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme
Luo Changpei, Director of the Institute of Linguistics, Chinese Academy of Sciences

The publication of the Draft Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme marks a significant step in the gradual transition of Chinese characters towards a Chinese phonetic writing system.

Chinese characters have a long history of over 4,000 years and have preserved a rich cultural heritage for the Chinese people. Their great contributions throughout history are undeniable. At the same time, the difficulty in learning, writing, and pronouncing Chinese characters, making them unsuitable for improving the cultural level of the broad masses, is also undeniable. Even from the perspective of the development of Chinese character creation methods, people realized very early on that the pictographic and ideographic functions of Chinese characters are far less convenient than their phonetic function. The so-called "Six Categories of Characters" at least included three categories – "Pictophonetic Compounds," "Borrowing," and "Derivative Cognates" – that primarily used sound. In "Shuowen Jiezi," compiled by Xu Shen in 100 AD, pictophonetic characters (such as "江" [jiāng] and "河" [hé], which use 氵as a radical and 工 [gōng] and 可 [kě] as phonetic components) accounted for over 80% of the 9,353 characters. Pictophonetic characters evolved from borrowed characters. For example, there is a flower called "芙蓉" [fúróng], and a bird called "鹧鸪" [zhègū]. Initially, only characters with the same sound were borrowed to represent them. Later, because it was a flower, it was written as "芙蓉", and because it was a bird, it was written as "鹧鸪", which then became newly created pictophonetic characters. Throughout history, the vast majority of newly created characters have been pictophonetic. Characters other than pictophonetic ones, such as "伞" [sǎn] (umbrella), "瘪" [biě] (deflated), and "泵" [bèng] (pump), are rare. As for "Borrowing," the use of "general borrowing" was actually the ancients writing incorrect characters, only caring about the sound and disregarding the meaning. There are many such characters in ancient books, causing many classicists to guess and speculate. This precisely reflects the strong demand of the ancients for phonetic representation in writing. Since the ancients had long been fond of writing incorrect characters, why can't modern people write incorrect characters, or more thoroughly switch to using phonetic notation or a phonetic writing system? As for categories like "Derivative Cognates" (for example, "谋" [móu] and "谟" [mó] explaining each other), there are too many explanations from the predecessors, which simply make people dizzy. In fact, in today's terms, it is just mutual explanation of dialect words, which is also a method of phonetic representation out of necessity.

In short, from the function of pictophonetic characters, borrowing, and derivative cognates, the ancients had long had a demand and tendency for phonetic representation in Chinese characters, but were constrained by the rigid forms of Chinese characters, so that the evolution stagnated at the pictophonetic method. This phenomenon has been stagnant for thousands of years, so why should we continue to tolerate its stagnation now?

Before the publication of this draft phonetic alphabet scheme, how did the Chinese people annotate the sounds of Chinese characters? There was a long and circuitous history in between.

Before 200 AD, the annotations in ancient books and dictionaries either used imprecise terms such as "rapid breath," "slow breath," "closed mouth," or "rounded mouth" as comparisons; or used vague terms such as "similar sound," "same sound," "pronounced as," or "like" to guess. These were far from scientific. Later, the "direct pronunciation" method of using one Chinese character to annotate another Chinese character (for example, "虹" [hóng] pronounced as "洪" [hóng], "视" [shì] pronounced as "示" [shì]) was sometimes difficult to find a character with exactly the same sound, and sometimes even if a character with the same sound was found, it was obscure and difficult to recognize, making it difficult to implement. In particular, some dictionaries had examples of circular mutual annotation (for example, "遥" [yáo] pronounced as "谣" [yáo], "谣" [yáo] pronounced as "遥" [yáo]), which made people even more confused! Because these methods could not solve the problem of phonetic annotation of Chinese characters, our predecessors invented the "fanqie" method in the third century BC.

The "fanqie" method uses two Chinese characters to spell out the sound of another Chinese character. Let's take the character "耐" [nài] as an example: "耐" is "奴代切" [nú dài qiè], which, analyzed using the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, yields the following formula: "耐" nài = "奴" nū + "代" dài. With this analysis, we can see that: "耐" and "奴" have the same initial sound n, and "耐" and "代" have the same final sound ài. Only by taking the n of "奴" and combining it with the ài of "代" can the sound of "耐" be pronounced. The final sound of "奴" and the initial sound of "代" are superfluous elements mixed in the middle.

This method is certainly an improvement compared to direct pronunciation, but to learn fanqie, one must first memorize 452 initial characters and more than 1,000 final characters in the "Guangyun" rhyme dictionary. How can the average person do this? Moreover, Chinese characters themselves do not show phonetic elements. We have to borrow the modern phonetic alphabet scheme to analyze it, and go around halfway to remove the initial and final parts. If we ask the broad masses to use it as a tool for phonetic annotation, it is simply impossible. In addition, the differences between ancient and modern pronunciations and dialects make it even more difficult to explain clearly. How can it compare to the current phonetic alphabet scheme, which is simple and clear, easy for everyone to learn, and can be quickly used for phonetic annotation?

Since the "fanqie" method encountered difficulties due to the inherent defects of Chinese characters, many phonologists in past dynasties, such as Lü Kun, Yang Xuanqi, Li Guangdi, Wang Lansheng, and Liu Xizai, exhausted their efforts to improve it, but they were confined to circling within Chinese characters, and as a result, they all ran into walls! Just take Yang Xuanqi in the mid-17th century as an example. Influenced by "Xiru Ermuzi" written by the French missionary Nicolas Trigault, he created a new fanqie using Chinese characters in 1659. Although he "tried hard" and "devised methods in a roundabout way," he could not be satisfied in his heart. He always felt that "it cannot really come out of the mouth, only those who are good at understanding can grasp it silently," "cannot extract it, regrettably!" Finally, he realized that he planned to translate this new fanqie into Manchu letters or Latin letters. This story tells us that only by adopting a phoneme-based phonetic alphabet scheme can the problem of Chinese character phonetic annotation be solved, and conditions can be prepared for Chinese character reform. The National Phonetic Alphabet borrows single-component Chinese characters as symbols. The initial consonant symbol only takes the pronunciation of the initial part, and the final vowel symbol only takes the pronunciation of the final part. When spelling, there are no useless components mixed in the middle. It is also an improvement compared to the old fanqie, but it cannot completely represent phonemes (such as ㄞ [āi], ㄟ [ēi], ㄠ [āo], ㄡ [ōu], etc.), and it is not easy to change, so although there are many letters, they are not very flexible, and some spellings are mixed with superfluous sounds (for example, the actual sounds of ㄧㄣ [yīn] and ㄧㄥ [yīng] are just in and iη, but according to the writing of the National Phonetic Alphabet, they are ien and ieη). Therefore, we feel that the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme (Draft) published by the Chinese Writing Reform Committee is more progressive than all previous Chinese character phonetic annotation methods.

This phonetic alphabet scheme uses Latin letters. The application of Latin letters in China has a relatively long historical tradition. In 1605, the Italian missionary Matteo Ricci used Latin letters as symbols for Chinese character phonetic annotation. In 1625, there was a book on Chinese phonology using Latin letters by the French missionary Nicolas Trigault - "Xiru Ermuzi." Scholars at the time, such as Fang Yizhi, Yang Xuanqi, and Liu Xianting, were influenced by this and had attempted to improve fanqie and even reform Chinese characters with reference to Latin letters. From the end of the 19th century, Lu Ganczhang (1892), Zhu Wenxiong (1906), Liu Mengyang (1908), Huang Xubai (1909), Xing Dao (1913), Liu Jishan (1914), Zhong Xiong (1918), and others successively imitated Latin letters to create Chinese phonetic alphabets. Due to the promotion of this movement, the Gwoyeu Romatzyh (National Romanization) scheme was produced in 1926, and the Latinxua Sin Wenz (Northern Dialect Latinized Writing) scheme was produced in 1931. After 25 years of deliberation and development, this new Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme was produced.

This phonetic alphabet scheme is a summary of the 350-year historical development of Chinese character phoneticization. Naturally, we cannot say that it is perfect. But it provides a good foundation. After this nationwide extensive discussion, it can certainly be made more perfect.

This scheme will first be used to annotate Chinese characters and as a teaching tool for Mandarin Chinese. But everything is changing and developing. If, after this scheme is published, the broad masses find it really applicable in practice, and there is no difficulty in using it to spell Mandarin Chinese, then, after a certain preparation stage and a series of scientific research work (such as the standardization of Chinese), this phonetic alphabet scheme is likely to gradually develop into a perfect Chinese phonetic writing system.

    从汉字造字和标音的历史看汉语拼音方案的进步性
    中国科学院语言研究所所长　罗常培
    汉语拼音方案（草案）的发表，是从汉字逐渐走向汉语拼音文字的一步重要的发展。
    汉字有4，000多年的悠久历史，给我国人民保留下很丰富的文化遗产，它在历史上的伟大功绩是没人能否认的；同时，汉字的难学、难写、难念，不适于提高广大人民的文化，也是没人能否认的。就是专从汉字造字方法的发展来看，很早已经有人觉得汉字的表形、表意的作用远不及表音的作用更为方便。旧来所谓“六书”至少有三书——“形声”、“假借”、“转注”——是拿声音作主体的。许慎在公元100年所作的“说文解字”，在9，353个字里，形声字（例如拿氵作偏旁，拿工、可作声符的“江”“河”）竟占了80％以上。形声字是由假借字发展出来的，比如：有个花儿叫“夫容”，有个鸟儿叫“遮姑”，当初只是假借相同的声音来代表，后来因为是花儿就写作“芙蓉”，因为是鸟儿就写作“鹧鸪”，那就变成后起的形声字了。历代所造的字，形声字更占绝大多数，形声字以外的字，像“伞”、“瘪”、“泵”之类是很少见的。至于假借里的“通借”，实际上就是古人只管声音不顾意义的写别字。这类字在古书里非常多，害得许多经学家猜来猜去。这正可以反映古人对于文字表音的要求是很强的。古人既然早就爱写别字，为什么现代人不能写别字，或者更彻底地改用拼音或拼音文字呢？还有“转注”一类（例如“谋”、“谟”互训等），从前人的解释太多，简直把人弄得头昏。其实照现在的意义来讲，它只是方言词的互注，也是一种不得已的表音方法。
    总之，从形声、假借、转注的功用来看，古人对于汉字早就有了表音的要求和倾向，只是受呆板的汉字形体所拘束，以致于演进到形声的方法就停滞不前了。这种现象一直停滞了几千年，为什么到现在还能容忍它继续停滞下去呢？
    在这个拼音方案草案发表以前，我国人民是怎样注汉字的声音的呢？中间曾经有过一段长久迂曲的历史。
    在公元200年以前，古书注解和字典的注音，或者用“急气”、“缓气”，“笼口”、“闭口”一类不精确的词来作比方；或者用“声近”、“声同”，“读如”、“读若”一类似是而非的词来瞎揣测：这都远不够科学的。后来用一个汉字注另一个汉字的“直音”法（例如“虹”音“洪”，“视”音“示”之类），有时很难找到恰好同音的字，有时虽然找到了同音的字，却又偏僻难认，也难行得通。尤其是字典里有一些循环互注的例（例如：“遥”音“谣”，“谣”音“遥”之类），就越发叫人莫名其妙了！由于这些方法都不能解决汉字的注音问题，到了公元前三世纪，我们的老前辈才发明了“反切”的方法。
    “反切”的方法是用两个汉字来拼切另一个汉字的音。我们试举“耐”字来说明：“耐”是“奴代切”，用汉语拼音方案来分析，可以得出下列的公式：“耐”nài＝“奴”nū＋“代”dài。这样一分析，我们就可以看出：“耐”和“奴”前半的音都是n，“耐”和“代”后半的音都是ài，只采取“奴”的n跟“代”的ài相拼，就可念出“耐”的音来。“奴”的后半和“代”的前半都是夹杂在中间的赘疣。
    这种方法比起直音来当然进步了，可是要学会反切，得先记熟广韵里452个上字，1，000多个下字，这岂是一般人做得到的？何况汉字本身是看不出音素来的，我们借用现代的拼音方案来分析，还得去头去尾地绕了半天弯儿；要是叫广大人民用它作注音的工具，那简直不可能。再加上古今音和方音的不同，一时更难解说得清楚。哪里能赶得上现在这个拼音方案简单明了，人人可以学会，可以很快地用它来注音呢？
    “反切”的方法既然因为汉字的先天的缺陷发生了困难，于是历代不少的音韵学家，像吕坤、杨选?、李光地、王兰生、刘熙载等，费尽心思想去改良它，但是他们局限在汉字里边兜圈子，结果都碰壁了！单举17世纪中叶的杨选?作例子。他受了法国传教士金尼阁所作“西儒耳目资”的影响，在1659年用汉字创造了一套新反切。他虽然“勉而又勉”地“宛转设法”，可是心里总不能满意，总觉得“实不能出诸口，惟善悟者默会而得之，”“不能为之拈出，恨恨！”最后他才想通了，打算把这套新反切翻译成满洲字母或拉丁字母。这个故事告诉我们：只有采用音素化的拼音方案才能解决汉字注音问题，才能给汉字改革准备条件。注音字母借用独体汉字作符号，声符只取前半的发音，韵符只取后半的发音，拼音时没有夹在中间的没用成分。它比较旧反切也是进步的，但还不能完全代表音素（例如ㄞ、ㄟ、ㄠ、ㄡ等），不便于变化，所以字母虽多，却很不灵活，有些拼法还夹杂着赘音（比方说，ㄧㄣ、ㄧㄥ的实际声音只是in、iη，照注音字母的写法就是ien、ieη）。因此我们觉得中国文字改革委员会发表的这个汉语拼音方案（草案）比以前各种汉字注音方法都是进步的。
    这个拼音方案采用拉丁字母。拉丁字母的应用，在中国已经有相当长久的历史传统，1605年意大利传教士利玛窦就用拉丁字母作汉字注音的符号。1625年就有了法国传教士金尼阁用拉丁字母讲汉语音韵学的书——“西儒耳目资”。当时的学者，像方以智、杨选?、刘献廷等受了这种影响，曾经有过参照拉丁字母改良反切，甚至于改革汉字的企图。从19世纪末叶起，卢戆章（1892），朱文熊（1906），刘孟扬（1908），黄虚白（1909），邢岛（1913），刘继善（1914），钟雄（1918）等，纷纷仿照拉丁字母来制造汉语的拼音字母。由于这种运动的推进，1926年产生了国语罗马字方案，1931年产生了北方话拉丁化方案。经过25年的酝酿和发展，又产生了这个新的汉语拼音方案。
    这个拼音方案正是350年来中国文字拼音化历史发展的总结。自然我们还不能说它是十全十美的。但是它提供了一个很好的基础。经过这次全国广泛讨论，一定可以使它更加完善。
    这个方案将首先是用来给汉字注音，和作为普通话的教学工具。但是一切事物是在变化、发展着的。如果这个方案公布以后，广大人民在实践中觉得它确实适用，用它来拼写普通话没有什么困难，那么，经过一定的准备阶段和一系列的科学研究工作（如汉语规范化等）之后，这个拼音方案就很可能逐步发展成为完善的汉语拼音文字。
