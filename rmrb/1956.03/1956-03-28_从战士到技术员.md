    From Soldier to Technician
    Zhu Zhensheng
    Two days before the Spring Festival, at the Yingxia Railway construction site, the Shuihongxi Bridge, under the technical guidance of Nie Zhiben, a young soldier and Youth League member, was completed forty-nine days ahead of schedule. The quality of the bridge was excellent. The regimental leaders and engineers unanimously praised Nie Zhiben, saying:
    "You really are a technician!"
    Three years ago, Nie Zhiben was just a soldier in the company. How did he transform from an ordinary soldier into a technician? There's a difficult journey in between.
    In the Spring Festival of 1953, Nie Zhiben and his comrades were urgently building a railway in the rear of Korea. One night, the instructor called him in and said:
    "Nie Zhiben, you are being transferred to the surveying team."
    "Surveying team? What for?"
    "What for? To work, of course!" After a pause, the instructor said seriously, "There's an important task: to learn technology. You should know how few technical personnel we have. The Party is sending you to the surveying team so that you can master a technical skill."
    Nie Zhiben went to the surveying team with great enthusiasm. The surveying team was busily surveying the route. During the day, Nie Zhiben and his comrades climbed mountains and trudged through snow, urgently surveying the railway; at night, they studied technical books on small kang tables. For someone who had only attended school for a few years, learning algebra, trigonometry, geometry, and railway surveying was naturally difficult. Especially after Nie Zhiben climbed mountains all day, falling countless times, his legs were already sore when he returned, and he could barely keep his eyes open on the kang. But he still perked up and carefully listened to the engineer's lectures.
    Particular mention should be made of Feng Jiye, a route selection engineer from a worker background, who not only lectured but also provided specific guidance to Nie Zhiben in solving various problems. When Nie Zhiben didn't understand the theory of triangulation, Feng Jiye took him to the section where triangulation was being carried out, let him do it in the field, and guided him from the side. Under Feng Jiye's guidance, in the tense combat environment, Nie Zhiben transformed from a soldier who knew nothing about technology to an excellent surveyor in one year.
    Having approached the gate of science and technology, Nie Zhiben was attracted by the many kinds of knowledge in the scientific field. In 1954, his first thought upon returning to the motherland from Korea was to go to school and study hard for a few years. However, a new task called him, and the train carried him from the temperate zone to the subtropical zone, plunging him into the intense construction of the Lizhan Railway.
    In the Lizhan Railway project, he had a broader field for learning. The deputy regimental commander and the engineers taught him knowledge about all aspects of bridge construction, and an old engineer named Dai, who led his work, almost taught him hand in hand. On hot days, the old engineer, after surveying the centerline of the locomotive depot, would take the umbrella from Nie Zhiben and hand him the instrument, asking him to calculate it again. If it didn't work once, try again, often leaving both of them drenched in sweat. Sometimes, Nie Zhiben would say embarrassedly:
    "Engineer Dai, go back and rest! Look, your clothes are soaked with sweat!"
    "What are you saying?" The engineer glanced at him and said, "Worry less about other things, and practice yours first! If you learn it, I'll be at ease too."
    Once, Nie Zhiben made a mistake—he misplaced the centerline of a curve. Just as he was saddened by the rework, the old engineer didn't say a word, helped him correct the error, and in the evening, gave him a detailed analysis of the cause of the mistake, giving him a long lesson.
    Late at night, Nie Zhiben came out of the engineer's house, carefully recalling his past life, and became more and more excited: how warm this big family was! Everyone he encountered, who didn't tell him their knowledge unreservedly, like treating their own child or younger brother, doing their best to help him grow? Nie Zhiben once again resolved: he must not fail the Party and comrades' cultivation and help, and even if there are insurmountable difficulties, he must conquer the fortress of science and technology!
    Hard work has paid off: Nie Zhiben has made great progress in technology. When he arrived at the Yingxia Railway, he immediately led a surveying team to be responsible for surveying the bridge site on a section of highway. The highway had just been completed, and the deputy regimental commander called him again and said:
    "Nie Zhiben, there is an important task to be entrusted to you. Several bridges over the Shuihongxi River are about to start construction in two or three days, and you will be fully responsible for the technical guidance of the construction."
    Nie Zhiben was really a little scared, but he didn't say it out loud. He knew that there were few technicians in the regiment. Besides, wouldn't he have to take independent responsibility someday? He pondered for a while and bravely agreed. The deputy regimental commander gave him detailed instructions on the matters that should be paid attention to during the construction, and said before leaving:
    "This burden is not light! The construction site is very far from here. However, we will help you."
    The construction site was in the remote mountains where people rarely lived. Near the bridge, there were no fields and no villages could be seen. Nie Zhiben put down his backpack, picked up his instrument, and took a few surveyors to the river beach to survey the bridge site. At this time, many old comrades who had joined the army with him surrounded him. Seeing him skillfully operating the theodolite like an old engineer, they were both envious and worried. Someone bluntly said, "Nie Zhiben, can you be responsible for such a big bridge?"
    "If he wasn't sure, would the superiors have called him here? You're really worrying too much about this." Someone said for him before Nie Zhiben could speak.
    Faced with many expectant and friendly gazes, Nie Zhiben could only respond to his comrades' concern with serious and meticulous work. After the bridge piers were surveyed, the foundation began to be dug, but the bridge company commander pulled Nie Zhiben and asked him to resurvey it. The company commander had built several bridges and had suffered losses due to inaccurate measurements, so he was not at ease with the previous measurements. The two used a tape measure and found that it was indeed off by two millimeters. Although this was a very small error, the company commander still said seriously:
    "This can't be sloppy! Correct it quickly!"
    Nie Zhiben blushed and quickly corrected it. These "two millimeters" happened to give him a "preventive shot," and he began to understand the importance of being careful and cautious when working alone. When the project officially started, there were even more difficulties. The position of the bridge and the water flow required the bridge piers to be round. Nie Zhiben had never built round bridge piers, and the carpenters had never made round formwork. He searched through several thick "Bridge Standard Design Drawings," recalling the bridges he had built in the past, and was about to start drawing the formwork diagram when a soldier digging the foundation ran over in a panic and said:
    "Oh no! Something's wrong, the foundation has been dug into a 'bottomless pit'! We've reached the design elevation, but there's no sign of stone!"
    Nie Zhiben was taken aback and quickly jumped into the foundation pit and measured it again. It was indeed dug to the design elevation! What was the reason? Suddenly, an idea came to mind: Could the drilling have been wrong? With the consent of the supervising engineer, he quickly decided:
    "Continue digging. We must be responsible to the country and not build the bridge on the sand."
    Nie Zhiben immediately reported this decision to the deputy regimental commander. The deputy regimental commander said from the telephone that he had done the right thing: "Drilling may sometimes be wrong. In the future, work should be done like this, putting the actual situation and design documents together."
    After digging two meters, rock appeared. According to the diagram drawn by Nie Zhiben, the round formwork was made "seamless" by the skilled carpenters. Nie Zhiben was still not at ease and personally watched the installation before pouring concrete. Another bridge was also starting to dig its foundation, and he had to run over there again. The bridges were more than ten miles apart, and it was nothing to run back and forth several times a day, but he always felt like something was hanging in his heart, worrying all day long. He knew that if he was even slightly careless, the quality of the entire bridge would be in question. He would rather rest less and sleep less than let a mistake occur. Late at night, he sorted out the time, labor, and material consumption of each process recorded during the day, and based on these materials, made a monthly, semi-monthly, and daily progress plan for the construction site, so that everyone on the bridge knew their work. In the early morning, he went to the bridgehead again, never leaving, measuring each layer of concrete poured with a theodolite. The soldiers saw that he was so busy that he didn't even have time to eat and advised him:
    "Go back and rest! Are you afraid we won't pour the concrete well?"
    Nie Zhiben held the theodolite stand and said with a smile, "No, of course you're doing well! It's just that my technical skills are low! I can also learn something by taking this opportunity."
    A young soldier is responsible for the technical guidance of the construction of such a large bridge, and the burden is not light. How many doubts, worries, and concerns should there be every day... Difficulties came one after another. However, Nie Zhiben remembered a leader's words, "Work has difficulties, and it's not called work if there are no difficulties." He lives in such an environment: he doesn't have to look everywhere for heroic figures to encourage himself from books or movies. Who among the many people around him who fight and live together with him is not dealing with difficulties all day long? The bridge tray is the latest design, and just when Nie Zhiben was feeling troubled about making it, the deputy regimental commander came with a personally designed drawing. When the deputy regimental commander explained the tray making method to him in detail on the bridge, someone quietly told him: the deputy regimental commander hadn't slept well for three nights to rush this design for him. The deputy regimental commander's burden is not light. He is responsible for how many construction sites, and he often has to work until two o'clock in the morning. However, he did not show any fatigue, and he was still energetic and full of life during the day. He said to Nie Zhiben:
    "A heavy burden is the people's trust in you! Of course, you must not fail the people's trust!"
    Nie Zhiben did this and really did not fail the people's trust. His technology has made leaps and bounds as the bridge rises. He has won people's respect and love with his selfless labor and hard study. He is too busy with work to eat, and the comrades prepare it for him; the work shed is very cold, and the company commander covers him with his own quilt; at night, the comrades see that he has been busy and tired all day and don't want to disturb him even if there is something going on. However, as soon as Nie Zhiben heard that something was happening on the bridge, he ran to the construction site and worked until dawn again.
    The Shuihongxi Bridge was completed, and Nie Zhiben went to another bridge. Just as he was working hard, he was called to the regimental headquarters again. The deputy regimental commander told him that a technician had been sent to take over his work, and the car was waiting at the foot of the mountain to take him to participate in the Iron Road Corps Advanced Workers Conference.

    从战士到技术员
    朱振声
    春节前两天，鹰厦铁路工地上，由一个年轻的战士、青年团员聂治本负责指导全部施工技术的水洪溪桥，提前四十九天建成了。桥的质量非常好。团首长和工程师们一致称赞聂治本说：
    “你真的是个技术员啊！”
    三年前，聂治本还是连队的战士。他是怎样由一个普通的士兵变为技术员的呢？这中间有段艰难的历程。
    1953年春节，聂治本和同志们在朝鲜后方抢建一条铁路。一天夜里，指导员把他找去，说：
    “聂治本，调你到测量队去。”
    “测量队，去干啥呀？”
    “干啥？，干活呗！”停一会，指导员又严肃地说：“有个重要的任务：学习技术。你该知道我们技术人材多么少，党把你送到测量队，是要你去掌握一门技术。”
    聂治本兴冲冲地赶到了测量队。测量队正在紧张地抢测线路。白天，聂治本和同志们一道爬山踏雪，紧张地勘测铁路；晚上，伏在小小的炕桌上，学习技术书籍。一个只念过很少几年书的人，现在要学习代数、三角、几何和铁路测量学，自然是困难重重。特别是聂治本白天爬了一天山，摔了不知道多少跤，回来两条腿已经酸溜溜的，伏在炕上就几乎睁不开眼了。但他仍振作起精神，细心听着工程师讲课。
    特别要提到的是一位工人出身的选线工程师冯继叶，他除了讲课，还具体指导聂治本解决各种疑难。聂治本弄不懂三角测量理论，冯继叶就带他到正在进行三角测量的地段去，让他实地做一番，在旁指点他。在冯继叶的指导下，聂治本在紧张的战斗环境里，一年时间，就由一个一点不懂技术的战士成为一个优秀的测工。
    接近了科学技术的大门，聂治本被科学领域的许多知识吸引住了。1954年，他从朝鲜回到祖国的第一个念头，就是想到学校好好学它几年。但是，新的任务召唤着他，火车把他从温带载到了亚热带，投入了紧张的黎湛铁路修建工程。
    在黎湛铁路工程中，他有了更广阔的学习园地，副团长和工程师们给他讲授桥梁建筑各方面的知识，领导他工作的一位姓戴的老工程师，几乎是把着手教他。大热天，老工程师本来把机务段中心线测好了，又从聂治本手中接过伞来，把仪器交给他，叫他再测算一遍。一次不行，再来一次，常常弄得两个人都汗流夹背。有时，聂治本不好意思地说：
    “戴工程师，你回去歇歇吧！瞧衣服都汗透啦！”
    “你老说什么？”工程师瞧了他一眼，说：“别的少关心，先练你的吧！学会了我也省心。”
    一次，聂治本出了个岔子——把一个弯道中心线打错了，正当他为返工而难过的时候，老工程师没有作声，帮他纠正了这个错误，晚上，才详细地给他分析错的原因，长长地给他讲了一课。
    深夜，聂治本从工程师房子里出来，细细回忆以往的生活，愈想愈激动：这个大家庭是多么温暖啊！他碰到的每一个人，谁不是把自己的知识无保留地告诉他，就像对待自己的孩子和小弟弟一般，尽力拉他成长？聂治本再一次下定决心：不能辜负党和同志们的培养、帮助，即使有天大的困难，也要攻下科学技术堡垒！
    辛勤的努力得到了收获：聂治本技术上有了飞跃的进步。到了鹰厦铁路，立即带领一个测量小组负责测定一段公路的桥位。公路刚刚修通，副团长又把他找去说：
    “聂治本，有个重要的任务要交给你了。水洪溪那边几座桥三两天就要开工，施工技术指导就交给你全部负责。”
    聂治本真有些害怕，但是他没有说出口来。团里技术人员少，这他是知道的。再说，难道一辈子不独立负责吗？他思索了一会，勇敢地答应了。副团长又详细地给他交代了施工中应当注意的事项，临走的时候说：
    “这付担子不轻啦！工地离这里很远。不过，我们会帮助你的。”
    工地在人烟稀少的深山。桥的附近，没有田地，也看不到村庄。聂治本把背包一放，拿起仪器，带着几个测工就跑去河滩测定桥位。这时候，许多同他一同入伍的老战友都围了上来。瞧他像个老工程师般熟练地摆弄着经纬仪，真是又羡慕又耽心。有人直率地说：“聂治本，这么座大桥，你能负责得了吗？”
    “没有把握，上级还会叫他来？真是多操这份心。”聂治本还没有开口，旁边有人给他说了。
    面对着许多期待、友善的眼光，聂治本只有用认真、细致的工作来回答同志们的关怀。桥墩测好了，开始挖基础了，桥梁连长却拉着聂治本，要他复测一遍。连长修过几座桥，因为测量不准确吃过亏，对刚才的测量不放心。两个人用皮尺一量，果真差两公厘。虽说这是极小的差错，连长还是认真地说：
    “这可马虎不得呵！快改过来吧！”
    聂治本脸一红，连忙改了。这“两公厘”恰是给他打下“预防针”，他开始懂得单独工作的时候，小心谨慎的重要了。工程正式开始，困难更多。桥的位置和水流要求桥墩是圆的，聂治本没有修过圆桥墩，木工们也没有做过圆模型板，他查翻着几本厚厚的“桥梁标准设计图”，回忆过去修的桥，正要动手画模型板图，挖基础的战士却慌忙跑来说：
    “哎呀！不好了，基础挖成个‘无底洞’啦！到了设计标高，石头的影子也没有！”
    聂治本吃了一惊，连忙跳到基础坑里，重新量了一遍。是挖到了设计标高呀！什么原因呢？猛然，一个念头涌上心来：是不是钻探错了呢？征得监察工程师的同意，他迅速决定：
    “继续挖下去。我们要对国家负责，不能把桥梁建筑在沙滩上。”
    聂治本立即把这个决定报告副团长。副团长从电话里说他做得对：“钻探有时也可能出错的，今后工作应当这样，把实际情况和设计文件放在一起看。”
    基础挖了两公尺，岩石出现了。按照聂治本画的图，经过木工们的巧手，圆模型板倒是做得“天衣无缝”。聂治本还不放心，亲自看安装好，才灌混凝土。另外一座桥又开始挖基础了，他又要跑过去。几座桥相距十几里，天天来回跑几趟倒没有什么，只是心上老觉着吊了块东西，成天耽心。他知道：只要他稍一不谨慎，整个桥的质量就成问题。他宁愿自己少歇点，少睡点，也不让出点差错。深夜，他把白天记录的各个工序的时间、人工、材料消耗量等整理出来，依据这些材料，作出了工地每月、每旬、每天的进度计划，让桥上每个人都知道自己的工作。清晨，他又到了桥头，一步也不离开，每灌一层混凝土都要用经纬仪量一次。战士们瞧他忙得饭也顾不上吃，劝他说：
    “回去歇歇吧！你还怕我们灌不好混凝土？”
    聂治本握着经纬仪架笑道：“那里，你们当然干得好！只是我技术低呀！借这个机会也好学点东西。”
    一个年轻的战士负责这么大座桥的施工技术指导工作，担子是不轻的，每天该有多少疑难、烦恼、耽心……困难一个接一个。可是，聂治本记得一位首长的话，“工作就有困难，没有困难就不叫工作。”他生活在这样一个环境里：不必到处从书本上，从电影中寻找鼓舞自己的英雄形象，周围和他共同战斗、共同生活的许多人，谁不是成天同困难打交道呢？桥梁托盘是最新设计，聂治本正为制作它感到棘手的时候，副团长带着亲自设计的图样来了。当副团长在桥上详细地给他讲解托盘制作方法的时候，有人轻轻告诉他：副团长为给他赶这个设计，三个晚上没睡好了。副团长的担子是不轻的，多少个工地要由他负责，他常常要工作到深夜两点。可是，他却没有一点疲劳的神色，白天仍然是精神爽朗，生气勃勃。他对聂治本说：
    “担子重，是人民信任你啊！你当然要不愧于人民的信任！”
    聂治本这样做了，真的没有愧于人民的信任。他的技术随着桥梁上升，有飞跃的提高。他用忘我的劳动和刻苦的学习博得了人们的尊敬和爱护。他工作忙顾不得吃饭，同志们就给他准备好；工棚很冷，连长便把自己的被子给他盖上了；夜里，同志们看他忙累了一天，有点事情都不想惊动他。可是，聂治本只要一听到桥上有事，就跑到了工地，一干又到了天亮。
    水洪溪桥建成了，聂治本又到了另外一座桥上。正当他紧张工作的时候，又被叫到团部去了。副团长告诉他，已经派了一个技术员代理他的工作，汽车在山下等着送他去参加铁道兵先进工作者大会。
