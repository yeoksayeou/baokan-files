    Streamline Meetings
    The amateur time of workers at the Nanjing Machine Tool Factory is being encroached upon by meetings. Even their six hours of weekly cultural study time cannot be guaranteed, with two hours being pushed to Sunday. Among the 401 people participating in the studies, 34 have been forced to discontinue their studies due to excessive meetings. Sports and recreational activities have almost come to a standstill. Young workers even need approval from the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations to play a game of ball.
    Workers have complaints about the excessive number of meetings, deliberately taking their time tidying up tools, washing hands, urinating, and dragging out time before meetings, and remaining silent during the meetings.
    The workers' sentiment is easy to understand. Because there are no appropriate recreational and sports activities in their spare time, it will hinder their physical health; without time to study, their cultural and technical level cannot be improved. The leaders of the Nanjing Machine Tool Factory should face this issue squarely and quickly streamline meetings.

    精简会议
    南京机床厂工人的业余时间都被会议侵占了，每星期六小时的文化学习时间也保证不了，其中有两小时要排到星期天去。参加学习的四百零一人中，已经有三十四人因会议太多而被迫停学。体育和娱乐活动几乎停顿，青年工人要打一次球，也要经过党、行政、工会和青年团组织批准。
    工人对会议过多有意见，故意在会前慢慢收拾工具、洗手、小便、拖时间，开会的时候不发言。
    工人的这种情绪是不难理解的。因为业余没有适当的文娱体育活动，就会妨碍身体健康；没有时间学习，文化技术水平就不能提高。南京机床厂的领导人员应该正视这个问题，迅速精简会议。
