Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 30th. According to the Indian Information Service: Indian Prime Minister Nehru stated on March 29th, at the conclusion of the debate on the appropriations requests for the Ministry of External Affairs in the People's Assembly, that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact are "wrong practices, dangerous practices, and harmful practices. They initiated the wrong trend and hindered the development of the correct trend."

	Nehru said: "Besides fundamentally following the wrong direction, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact also directly affect us and, in a sense, tend to encircle us from two or three sides. Indeed, the Baghdad Pact has in fact created unprecedented and more serious tensions and hostility in West Asia. It has set countries against each other, and I don't know how people can say that this treaty has brought security and stability to West Asia."

	Nehru added: "Among the people here, no one would imagine that Pakistan joined this (Baghdad) Pact because it anticipates some kind of encroachment or aggression from the Soviet Union in the near or distant future. If we read Pakistani newspapers and the speeches made by responsible figures there, we will find it perfectly clear that they are doing this because of India—if not because they are very afraid of India, then because they hope to develop their strength and, as they usually say, speak with strength. Whether this is the case or not, they joined the Baghdad Pact and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization mainly because they are hostile to India. I am not hostile to them. I cannot help but feel extremely depressed at the thought of fighting with Pakistan."

	Nehru said, "I firmly believe that the other member states of the Baghdad Pact do not harbor hostility towards India. I am prepared to fully accept the assurances given to me by the leaders of the United States of America, and I firmly believe that they do not harbor malice. Their intentions are in other places in the north, or in other directions. But the effect is still the same. People are connected. Countries are connected to each other, and each country is pulling in different directions. In times of crisis, you will be pulled in directions you never thought you would go."

	Nehru spent a large part of his speech discussing the Kashmir issue. He said that the continued stationing of Pakistani troops in Jammu and Kashmir means that all talk about referendums, etc., is completely out of touch with the substance of the issue. This issue will only arise when Pakistan withdraws its troops. Nehru said that the Kashmir issue basically started in the second half of October 1947 with the aggression against Jammu and Kashmir by Pakistan and from Pakistan. He said that the second fact to remember is that Kashmir legally and constitutionally acceded to India. This is also an undeniable fact.

	Nehru welcomed the proposal for a "non-aggression declaration" between India and Pakistan. Regarding the steps of mediation and arbitration, he said he did not know of any country that would agree to such procedural steps.

	Referring to the emergence of New China, Nehru said that some major powers still do not correctly recognize the existence of a large country like China. He said, "Of course, they know, but they seem to be lacking something, otherwise their policies would be different. But this is not just about China; it is also these countries' view of all Asian and African issues. Their previous concept was that these issues should be resolved by the great powers, with little consideration for the views that Asian countries might have on these issues. There has been some slight change later, and Asian countries are sometimes asked for their views on these issues, or even allowed to sit in the corner of the meeting room. But, in the final analysis, they still hold to the basic concept that it is the responsibility and obligation of those great powers in the West to bear the heavy burden of the world. However, Asia does not want them to bear such a heavy burden."

	Regarding India's association with the Commonwealth, he said: "I think our participation in the Commonwealth is because it is beneficial to us and to the cause we hope to support, because it does not hinder our policies and is beneficial, and our participation in the Commonwealth is because we welcome any association with other countries as long as this association does not hinder our policies. We have other associations with other countries in Asia and Europe, and these associations are sometimes closer than our associations with the Commonwealth countries."

	When talking about Indochina, Nehru said that India is involved in the Indochina issue because it holds the chairmanship in the international commission there. Special difficulties have arisen again in South Vietnam, because the current government of South Vietnam refuses to accept the obligations stipulated in the Geneva Accords, on the grounds that it did not sign the Geneva Accords.

	He pointed out: "Although it did not sign, it is the successor government to France, which did sign. It has accepted all the benefits provided by this agreement, and it continues to enjoy these benefits at present, but so far, it does not accept the obligations." Nehru said: "This puts us in a very difficult position, because we went to Indochina or Vietnam because of the Geneva Accords. If the Geneva Accords are not accepted, then we have no place there."

	Nehru added: "Of course, I don't know how things will develop, but recently there have been hopeful signs indicating that the South Vietnamese government may accept the obligations arising from the Geneva Accords, which would make it easier for us to carry out our tasks."

### 尼赫鲁抨击东南亚条约和巴格达条约

    尼赫鲁抨击东南亚条约和巴格达条约
    新华社新德里30日电　据印度新闻处消息：印度总理尼赫鲁三月二十九日在人民院结束关于外交部的拨款要求的辩论时发言说：东南亚条约组织和巴格达条约是“错误的作法、危险的作法和有害的作法。它们开始了错误的趋势，阻止了正确趋势的发展。”
    尼赫鲁说：“东南亚条约组织和巴格达条约，除了根本上就遵循着错误的方向以外，还直接影响到我们，而且，在某种意义上说，有从两三方面包围我们的趋势。的确，巴格达条约事实上在西亚造成了前所未有的更加严重的紧张局势和敌对。它已经使国家互相反对，我不知道人们怎么竟然能够说这个条约使西亚获得了安全和稳定。”
    尼赫鲁又说：“在这里的人们中间，的确谁也不会设想：巴基斯坦所以参加这个（巴格达）条约，是因为它预料眼前或者遥远的将来会从苏联那方面发生某种进犯或是侵略。假如我们阅读巴基斯坦的报纸以及那里的负责人士所发表的谈话，我们就会完全清楚地发现：他们这样作是因为印度——假如不是因为他们对于印度十分感到恐惧，那末就是因为他们希望发展实力，并且像平常所说的那样用实力来说话。不管是不是这样，他们所以参加巴格达条约和东南亚条约组织，基本上是因为他们敌视印度。我并不敌视他们。我一想到同巴基斯坦作战，就不能不感到极其沮丧。”
    尼赫鲁说，“我非常相信，巴格达条约的其他成员国家对印度并不怀有敌意。我准备完全接受美利坚合众国领袖给我的保证，并且我非常相信，他们并不怀有恶意。他们的用意是在北方的其他地方，或者在其他方向。但是效果仍然是一样。人们是有关联的。国家互相是有关联的，每一个国家向不同的方向拉。在危机的时候，你会被拉上你从来没有想到要走的方向。”
    尼赫鲁在演说中用一大部分时间来谈论克什米尔问题。他谈到巴基斯坦军队继续驻扎在查谟和克什米尔说：所有关于公民投票等等的谈论完全是没有接触到问题的实质。只有当巴基斯坦撤退了军队的时候，这个问题才会产生。尼赫鲁说：克什米尔问题基本上是从1947年10月下半月通过巴基斯坦和由巴基斯坦对查谟和克什米尔邦进行侵略的时候开始的。他说：要记住的第二个事实是：克什米尔是合法地和经过宪法手续地参加到印度之中的。这一点也是没有疑问的事实。
    尼赫鲁表示欢迎印度和巴基斯坦发表“非战宣言”的建议。关于调停和仲裁的步骤，他说，他不知道有任何国家同意这样的手续步骤。
    谈到新中国的出现，尼赫鲁说，有些大国似乎仍没有正确地认识到像中国这样一个大国的存在。他说：“当然，它们是知道的，但是它们好像缺少某种东西，不然的话，它们的政策就会有所不同了。但是这并不仅仅是关于中国的问题，这也是这些国家对所有亚洲和非洲问题的看法。它们以前的观念是认为这些问题要由大国来解决，很少考虑到亚洲国家对这些问题可能有的看法。后来曾经稍微有了一些改变，亚洲国家有时候也被问到对这些问题的看法，或者甚至被允许坐在会议室的角落里。但是，归根到底还是抱着这样的基本概念：负起全世界的重任是西方那些大国的责任和义务。然而亚洲并不希望它们担负这样的重任。”
    关于印度同英联邦的联合关系，他说：“我想，我们的参加英联邦，是因为这对我们和对我们希望支持的事业是有好处的，是因为这对于我们所遵循的政策毫无妨碍，并且是有益的，我们的参加英联邦是因为我们欢迎同其他国家之间的任何联合，只要这种联合不妨碍我们的政策。我们同亚洲和欧洲的其他国家有其他的联合，而这种联合有时候比我们同英联邦国家之间的联合更密切。”
    尼赫鲁在谈到印度支那的时候说：印度牵涉在印度支那问题上，因为它在那里的国际委员会中担任主席。在南越又发生了特别困难，因为南越现政府拒绝接受日内瓦协议所规定的义务，理由是它没有在日内瓦协议上签字。
    他指出：“虽然它没有签字，但是它是曾经签字的法国的继承政府。它已经接受了这个协议所提供的一切利益，而且它目前继续享受这种利益，可是到目前为止，它却不接受义务。”尼赫鲁说：“这使我们处在十分困难的地位，因为我们是因为日内瓦协议才到印度支那或者越南去的。假如日内瓦协议不被接受，那末我们在那里就没有地位了。”
    尼赫鲁又说：“当然我不知道事情会怎样发展下去，可是最近已经有令人产生希望的迹象表明：南越政府可能接受日内瓦协议所产生的义务，从而也就会使我们更容易执行任务了。”
