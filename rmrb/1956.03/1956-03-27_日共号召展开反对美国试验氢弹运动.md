Xinhua News Agency, March 25th, Tokyo Dispatch: The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on March 15, calling on all Japanese people to launch a large-scale national movement demanding that the United States stop testing hydrogen bombs.

The statement said that the more than 30 million signatures demanding the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs, and the resolutions against atomic and hydrogen bombs passed by the Diet and the assemblies of many local autonomous bodies, clearly demonstrate the common sentiment of the Japanese people demanding the prohibition of the testing and use of atomic and hydrogen bombs.

The Japanese Communist Party believes that the inhumane behavior of the United States government, disregarding the will of the Japanese people and the resolutions of the Diet, and attempting to subject the Japanese people to the disaster of atomic and hydrogen bombs for the fourth time, cannot be tolerated under any circumstances.

The Japanese people have the right to demand that the Hatoyama Cabinet meet our demands and safeguard our interests, and, in accordance with the resolution of the Diet, strongly demand that the United States stop atomic and hydrogen bomb experiments in the future.

The announcement pointed out that opposing hydrogen bomb tests is the common aspiration of mankind. Many people in the world are resolutely opposing hydrogen bomb tests and supporting the movement of the Japanese people.
