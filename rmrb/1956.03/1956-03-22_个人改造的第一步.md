The bell for work rings. Liu Gongcheng stood at the window of the factory director's office, looking at the workers flowing into the workshop like water and the long line of trucks coming to pick up cement, and felt unspeakable joy in his heart.

The Shanghai Cement Factory, since its transformation into a joint state-private enterprise on July 1, 1954, has not undergone any particularly noticeable changes on the surface. The capitalist representative, Liu Gongcheng, still serves as the factory director, and the factory's machinery has not been significantly added to. However, the red line on the production indicator chart rises day by day. The output of the two rotary kilns initially failed to reach 90% of their design capacity, but after the joint state-private operation, it exceeded the design capacity by 40%. In the past, the kiln had to be repaired every two or three months, but now it can operate safely for 324 days at a time. In the second half of 1955, the entire factory launched a labor competition, saving 260,000 yuan in six months. In 1955, the cost of products was reduced by 5.96% compared to 1954.

A year ago, Liu Gongcheng saw some new production records after the joint state-private enterprise was established. On the one hand, he sincerely believed that the joint state-private enterprise was indeed superior. On the other hand, he also had a misconception that enterprise transformation was not that difficult, and personal transformation was probably just the same.

Just when he was feeling happy, production suddenly declined. The reason was that the weather was getting hotter, and the ventilation of the chimney was poor, reducing the amount of air entering the kiln. Seeing the production decreasing day by day, the workers became anxious and desperately fed coal into the kiln. However, production continued to decline. The chimney billowed with black smoke, the materials were not thoroughly burned, and the cement produced did not meet standards.

Liu Gongcheng was alarmed when he saw the piles of substandard cement in the warehouse. He picked up the phone and issued an order to the workshop director: "Tell the workers to stop forced production and reduce the feeding." Unexpectedly, the answer he received was: "I have already discussed it with the workers. Reducing the feeding and reducing production is not a solution. Director, you studied cement, can you use your brain and actively think of a solution?" The workshop director was an old worker and a city-level labor model. Upon hearing this, Liu Gongcheng threw down the phone.

Liu Gongcheng studied cement in the United States and Japan for seven or eight years. The books say: The slurry is thick, and more coal and air are needed. He believed that his handling was correct. Now the workers were "contradicting" him, weren't they deliberately messing with him and making him look bad? Before the joint state-private enterprise, whatever the factory director said was the law, and no one ever said it was wrong.

He felt very uncomfortable about this. At a meeting to discuss the organizational structure, he couldn't help but ask the state representative: "When there are disagreements on major issues in the factory, who should make the decision?" The state representative said: "Of course, the factory director decides, but we must also rely on the workers." This answer was not satisfactory either. He thought: "The workers only see output and don't see quality. Why are you blindly pursuing output too?" But he didn't dare to raise it directly, so he could only say indirectly: "Now the newspapers are criticizing the blind pursuit of output and neglecting quality every day. How can we hand over a large number of defective products to the state?" The state representative listened and said: "It's good to pay attention to quality, and the starting point of the workers in the workshop is also good. You should discuss it with them together. Is there no other way besides reducing the feeding?"

As he spoke, he immediately invited several veteran technical workers from the workshop. At the meeting, the old workers put forward many positive suggestions for production.

However, Liu Gongcheng could not calm down. He kept suspecting: "Maybe they look down on my technology!" His heart was in turmoil. After the joint state-private enterprise, he had always suspected that everyone looked down on him, and this further confirmed that everyone did not take the capitalists seriously.

However, when the ideological struggle calmed down a little, he couldn't help but think of other facts: Once, when the factory promoted workers to leadership positions, he was initially suspicious and refused to nominate anyone. Later, everyone repeatedly asked him to express his opinion, and only then did he put forward a few names. As a result, all the workers he nominated were promoted. How could this be said that everyone did not trust him? Thinking carefully again, after the joint state-private enterprise, none of his correct opinions raised at the factory management committee and the workers' congress were not supported by the workers!

Thinking in this direction, he thought of the factory's production. To be honest, after the joint state-private enterprise, production was not getting worse, but better. The two kilns could produce an average of more than seventeen tons of cement per hour. This was unprecedented in the factory's history. A major overhaul used to take fifteen days, but now it takes at most seven days. Where did these achievements come from? Did he make them? No, he didn't. Before the joint state-private enterprise, he was in charge of everything in the factory, but production was not good. After the joint state-private enterprise, he was always afraid of getting involved in too many things, pushing away whatever he could except for his own duties; he believed that the state was the leader and he was being led, as long as the things he was in charge of didn't have any problems; but production improved instead.

He thought of the workers. Indeed, the workers had changed greatly. Now, without administrators watching in the workshop, the workers not only worked hard, but also came up with ideas to continuously improve operations, enabling the kiln to achieve a record of safe operation for more than 300 days.

But why were they only concerned about output and not about quality? Did they want to ruin production? Of course not. It was because they had no way to solve the quality problem and were unwilling to let production stop, so they acted blindly. He understood the technology, so why couldn't he listen to their opinions more, think of ways to not only avoid reducing production, but also improve quality?

His heart was clear, and a great weight was lifted from his shoulders. He said to the state representative and the workshop director: "I was too one-sided in my thinking. Now I am willing to study measures to improve quality with the workers."

"Can we formulate a slurry that can be used at higher temperatures?" He remembered that the laboratory had experimented with lowering the lime saturation rate of the slurry last year, but failed. Why did it fail? He went to the workers, to the workshop director. They said that during the experiment last year, they also knew that the slurry composition was changing, but the changes were too fast, sometimes this way, sometimes that way, and they couldn't figure out how much had changed, so they had to operate according to the old method regardless. In this way, the problem became clear: there was no good cooperation with the workers.

From then on, the workers often saw the factory director running around in the workshop and the laboratory. He discussed with the workers in the workshop and the departments how to quickly rotate the kiln and how to change the slurry composition. Soon, the kiln firing situation stabilized, the chimney no longer emitted black smoke, and the quality of the cement returned to its previous standards. By May, the weather was getting hotter day by day, but the kiln's output still exceeded January's by 0.91%, and coal consumption was reduced by 0.66%.

Liu Gongcheng no longer believed that he had nothing to transform, and no longer felt that ideological transformation was such a simple and easy task. He said: "Although I know that I must rely on the workers in my work, and in fact I am closer to the workers, when I encounter some specific problems, sometimes I still can't shake off the arrogant director's demeanor, and my old technical ideas have not been completely changed. What's worse is that I have too many suspicions. All of these hinder my ideological transformation. The Party and the workers have helped me take a big step forward in transformation. In the future, I still need to go deep into work practice and work hard to transform myself."

    个人改造的第一步
    本报记者　傅冬
    上工的钟声响了。刘公诚站在厂长室的窗口，望着像流水一样进入车间的工人和排成一长溜来取水泥的汽车，心里真有说不出的愉快。
    上海水泥厂自从1954年7月1日公私合营以后，从表面上看并没有特出的变化。资方代表刘公诚仍旧担任厂长的职务，工厂的机器也没添什么。可是生产指示图表上的红线，却一天比一天高。两个回转窑的产量，早先还达不到设计能力的90％，公私合营后超过了设计能力40％。从前两、三个月就要修一次窑，现在一次能安全运转324天。1955年下半年全厂开展劳动竞赛，六个月功夫就节约了26万元。1955年产品的成本比1954年降低了5.96％。
    一年前，刘公诚看到公私合营后生产上的一些新纪录，一方面衷心地相信了公私合营的确优越，另一方面也产生了一种错觉，以为企业改造并不怎么困难，而个人的改造，大概也不过如此。
    正高兴得好好的，突然生产下降了。原因是天气渐热，烟囱的通风不好，进到窑里的空气少了。工人眼见生产一天比一天少，急起来，就拚命往窑里送煤。可是生产还是一个劲地往下跌。烟囱直冒黑烟，料子烧不透，烧出来的水泥不合标准。
    刘公诚看见仓库里不合格的水泥堆得像山一样，也着起慌来。他拿起电话对车间主任下了个命令：“叫工人停止强制生产，少送料。”没想到回答他的是：“我已经同工人商量过了，少送料，降低产量，不是个办法。厂长，你是学水泥的，能不能动动脑筋，积极的想个办法呢？”车间主任是个老工人，是全市的劳动模范。刘公诚一听这话，就把电话扔下了。
    刘公诚在美国、日本学过七、八年水泥，书本上是这样写的：料浆浓，煤和空气就需要得多。他认为自己的处理是正确的。工人现在“顶”他，岂不是诚心同他捣乱，给他难看吗？公私合营前，厂长说什么就是什么，从来也没人说过不对。
    为了这事，他很不舒服。在一次讨论组织机构的会议上，他实在忍不住了，他问公方代表：“厂里的一些重大问题，大伙意见不统一的时候，该由谁来决定？”公方代表说：“当然由厂长决定，但是也要依靠工人。”这话也不投意，他心里想：“工人只看到产量，看不见质量，你怎么也盲目地追求产量？”可是又不敢正面提出，只好拐弯抹角地说：“现在报上天天批评盲目追求产量，不重视质量，咱们怎能把大量的次品交给国家？”公方代表听了说：“重视质量是好的，车间工人的出发点也是好的，你应该同他们一起商量商量，是不是除了少送料就没有第二个法儿？”
    说着，当下就把车间里几位老技术工人请来。老工人在会上对生产又提了好多积极的建议。
    但是，刘公诚总是平静不下来。他不断地猜疑着：大概他们是瞧不起我的技术吧！心里就像十五个吊桶似的七上八下乱折腾。公私合营后他一直就怀疑大伙看不起他，这下更证实了大伙不把资方放在眼里。
    可是，等到思想斗争稍一平静的时候，他又不能不想起另外一些事实：一次工厂提拔工人做领导工作，自己开头也是疑心，不肯提名。后来大伙一再要自己表示意见，才提出了几个名字。结果自己提的那几个工人都被提拔了。这怎么能说大伙不相信自己呢？再仔细想一想，合营后自己在工厂管理委员会和职工大会上提的正确意见，也没有那一次工人不支持呀！
    朝这方面一想，他就想起了工厂的生产。说实在的，公私合营后，生产不是越来越坏，而是越来越好。两个窑一点钟平均能产十七吨多的水泥。这是厂里历史上还没有过的事。大检修一次以前要花十五天功夫，现在顶多七天。这成绩是从那里来的呀？是自己作的吗？不，不是。公私合营前，自己掌管厂内一切，可是生产搞得并不好。公私合营后，自己总是怕多管事，除了分内的事，能推掉的就推掉；认为公方是领导，我是被领导，只要自己管的事不出漏子就行了；而生产反倒好了。
    他想到工人。真的，工人确是大改样了。如今车间没有管理员钉着，工人不光是努力干活，还真能出主意不断改进操作，使大窑达到安全运转三百多天的纪录。
    但是，他们为什么只顾产量不顾质量呢？是想把生产搞坏吗？当然不是。这是因为他们没有办法解决质量问题，又不愿让生产停顿，就盲目干起来了。自己懂技术，为什么不能多听听他们的意见，想想办法，既能不减产，又能改进质量呢？
    心里一通，身上轻了一大截。他对公方代表和车间主任说：“我想的太片面了。现在我愿意和工人研究提高质量的措施。”
    “能不能配制一种在较高气温下用的料浆？”他想起去年化验室曾经试验过降低料浆石灰饱和率的法子，但是失败了。为什么失败了呢？他去找工人，找车间主任，他们说去年试验的时候，也知道变动料浆成分，但是变动得太快，一会儿这样，一会儿那样，弄不清变了多少，只好不管三七二十一，仍按老法子操作。这么一来，问题弄清楚了，是没和工人很好地配合。
    打这以后，工人常常看见厂长在车间和化验室里奔忙，他和车间、科室的工人一块商量怎么样快速转窑，怎么样变动料浆成分。不久，烧窑的情况稳定了下来，烟囱里不再冒黑烟了，水泥的质量恢复到先前的标准了。到五月，天气一天比一天热，但是窑的产量还超过一月份0.91％，煤耗降低了0.66％。
    刘公诚再不认为自己没什么要改造的了，也再不觉得思想改造是那么简单容易的事了。他说：“我虽然知道了在工作中要依靠工人，而且事实上也比较和工人接近了；可是碰到一些具体问题，有时候那妄自尊大的厂长架子还拿不下来，旧的技术思想也还没有彻底改变，更坏的是猜疑太多，这都有碍自己的思想改造。党和工人帮助我在改造上进了一大步，今后还需要我自己深入到工作实践中努力改造自己。”
