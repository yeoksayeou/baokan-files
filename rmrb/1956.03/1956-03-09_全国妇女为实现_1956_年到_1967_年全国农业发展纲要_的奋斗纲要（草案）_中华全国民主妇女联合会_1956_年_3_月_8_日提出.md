The "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) from 1956 to 1967" proposed to the people of the whole country by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on January 23, 1956, is a great program for completing the socialist transformation of agriculture in our country and building a new socialist countryside. Realizing this program is a fundamental prerequisite for rural women to achieve complete liberation and true equality between men and women.

This program encourages the people of the whole country to advance more actively on the socialist road, promotes the further development of the high tide of agricultural cooperation and agricultural production, and promotes the accelerated progress of socialist industrialization in our country. Its realization will enable the 500 million men and women farmers across the country to obtain a better and happier life.

In order to mobilize women across the country to play a fuller role and contribute their strength in the great struggle to realize the National Agricultural Development Program, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation held a meeting of directors of women's federations from various provinces and cities from January 26 to February 4, 1956 for discussions. It also held three symposiums with some county and district party secretaries and directors of special district branches of provincial women's federations who came to Beijing for meetings. Then, on March 6, it convened a meeting of the Standing Committee of the National Women's Federation for discussions and formulated this draft program. Now, taking advantage of the widespread commemoration of their own festival—International Women's Day on March 8—by women across the country, this draft is published, requiring women's federations at all levels and women across the country to conduct extensive and in-depth discussions, gather opinions, and submit them to the Second Session of the Third Executive Committee of the National Women's Federation to be convened after April of this year for discussion and approval.

I. All rural women in the country should realize that the socialist road is the road to the complete liberation of women, and resolutely take the road of cooperation. Rural women should actively join agricultural production cooperatives. Female members in cooperatives that have the conditions to upgrade to advanced cooperatives should transfer to advanced cooperatives together with male members, and ensure that the advanced form of agricultural cooperation is basically completed by 1958. Women among salt workers, fishermen, and boat people should voluntarily participate in salt workers', fishermen's, and boat people's cooperatives. Women among herdsmen should participate in animal husbandry cooperatives together with male herdsmen, according to the development plan of cooperatives in their respective regions.

Village women's representative meetings or agricultural, fishing, salt, boat, and animal husbandry cooperative female member representative meetings and women's federations at all levels should conduct extensive and in-depth publicity and education on socialism, women's liberation, the "Model Charter of Agricultural Production Cooperatives," the National Agricultural Development Program, and various related policies among women, improve the socialist consciousness of women, and enable the agricultural cooperation of our country to continue to develop healthily and be completed well and quickly.

II. Rural women should give full play to their socialist enthusiasm, actively participate in agricultural and sideline production labor, and improve labor productivity, and strive to ensure that every rural female full-time laborer has no less than 120 working days of production labor per year within seven years. Women who have already reached or exceeded 120 working days in production labor should strive to work more days under possible conditions. Women who have not reached 120 working days per year should strive to reach or reach ahead of schedule and exceed 120 working days within 7 years. To this end, rural women should plan their housework in order to participate in production labor with more time under possible conditions.

Village women's representative meetings or agricultural production cooperative female member representative meetings and women's federations at all levels should assist the management committee of agricultural production cooperatives to correctly calculate female labor according to the requirements of unified calculation, unified arrangement, and unified use of male and female labor, and incorporate female labor into production teams in a planned way; and according to women's specialties and physiological characteristics, effectively formulate construction plans including male and female labor to give full play to women's labor potential and improve the labor utilization rate of female labor. For women who can do light labor, they should be appropriately assigned labor within their capacity. For elderly, weak, widowed, orphaned, and women lacking labor, they should be arranged for appropriate production and work as much as possible, and those who have completely lost their ability to work and have no support should be properly settled. It is necessary to overcome unreasonable phenomena such as not arranging female labor, temporarily grabbing it, or discriminating against and excluding it. It is also necessary to assist the management committee of agricultural production cooperatives to gradually establish public flour mills, rice mills, sewing groups, and farm busy season canteens and other facilities to serve the lives of cooperative members according to needs and conditions, so as to appropriately reduce women's housework burden and enable female labor to better play a role in agricultural and sideline production.

III. In order to ensure the completion of grain, cotton, and other crop production increase targets, rural women must play an active role in realizing the ten major production increase measures. To this end, all women with labor must learn production technology, improve operational skills, and expand the scope of labor:

(1) Learn to use new technologies to cultivate and manage cotton, tobacco, tea, hemp, oil and other crops suitable for women to manage. Learn agricultural production increase technologies such as seed selection, seed soaking, seed dressing with medicine, rational close planting, thinning, seedling protection, artificial pollination, topdressing, weeding, pesticide insecticide, pruning and vine training. Learn gardening skills such as cultivating fruit trees and planting vegetables.

(2) Participate in labor suitable for women's physical strength in water conservancy, soil and water conservation, soil improvement, and expansion of cultivated land area.

(3) Use various methods to widely find fertilizer sources, accumulate large amounts of fertilizer, store human manure, urine, chicken and pig manure, firewood and grass ash, and create various appropriate methods to store various miscellaneous fertilizers. Learn fertilizer accumulation methods such as pressing green manure and high-temperature composting.

(4) Learn to use various new agricultural tools suitable for women's operation: such as double-wheel double-share plows, seeders, threshers, and grass cutters.

Village women's representative meetings or cooperative female member representative meetings and women's federations at all levels should assist relevant departments in conducting education on scientific common sense among women and popularizing advanced experience. It is necessary to mobilize and recommend women to participate in various technical schools or technical training classes. In the labor production process, it is necessary to advocate methods such as men teaching women to learn, mutual teaching and mutual learning, and teaching now and teaching now to organize women to learn technology. It is necessary to plan to train a large number of female tractor drivers and female agricultural tool operators. It is necessary to achieve that everything has a model and every industry has a skilled person.

IV. Rural women should contribute more to various sideline production and animal husbandry production suitable for women to undertake, and create more wealth. In order to improve meat supply and increase the income of farmers' families and cooperatives, and develop a large number of fertilizer sources, rural women should raise more pigs, and take raising pigs as one of the main sidelines of women (except for women who believe in Islam). Learn pig raising methods and constantly accumulate breeding experience. Find all kinds of alternative feed as much as possible, so that less grain is used and more fat pigs are fed. In raising cattle, sheep, donkeys, horses and other livestock, pay attention to protecting female animals and caring for young animals. Also raise more chickens, ducks, geese and other poultry. Learn how to prevent epidemic diseases of poultry and livestock and simple methods of treating pig and chicken diseases. Rural women should actively participate in beekeeping, silkworm raising, sugar boiling, flour making, tofu making, weaving mats, weaving baskets and other sideline production.

Village women's representative meetings or cooperative female member representative meetings and women's federations at all levels should actively publicize the benefits of pig raising and plan to promote advanced experience in pig raising. In areas where there is no habit of raising pigs, the local agricultural production cooperatives should be assisted to vigorously break conservative thinking and mobilize and guide women to raise more pigs. In addition, it should also regularly disseminate scientific feeding methods for raising pigs, sheep, chickens, ducks, geese and other livestock and poultry. It is also necessary to help and train women to work in pig farms and chicken farms run by cooperatives.

V. The principle of equal pay for equal work must be resolutely implemented within the cooperative, to this end:

(1) Female members must learn technology well, work hard in production, give play to their creative talents, and make achievements in their work.

(2) Female members should make suggestions to the cooperative at any time regarding the problems existing in the implementation of equal pay for equal work, and help the cooperative implement fair work point calculation methods and establish a reasonable work point recording system.

(3) Village women's representative meetings or cooperative female member representative meetings and women's federations at all levels should widely publicize the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women and fight against phenomena that violate equal pay for equal work for men and women. Assist the cooperative in correcting the erroneous practices that hinder women from participating in labor, suppress women's work points, or rigidly compare the physical strength of male and female members.

VI. In order to ensure that the most serious pests and diseases that endanger crops are basically eliminated in all possible places within 7 to 12 years, rural women must give play to their excellent characteristics of patience and meticulousness and become an active force in eliminating crop pests and diseases. Rural women should learn the basic common sense of plant protection and plant quarantine. Women participating in agricultural labor should generally learn to use sprayers and powder sprayers, and learn to prepare simple daily-use pesticides as much as possible, so that they can prevent pests and diseases before they occur and eliminate them in time after they occur.

Village women's representative meetings or cooperative female member representative meetings and women's federations at all levels should cooperate with agricultural production cooperatives to carry out common sense education on eliminating crop pests and diseases, and break the superstitious and backward ideas that hinder the elimination of pests and diseases.

VII. Rural women should actively participate in the work of greening the motherland, and according to women's characteristics and possibilities, actively participate in sowing on barren hills, cultivating seedlings, protecting nurseries, planting trees and afforestation, and protecting forests from fire.

Village women's representative meetings or cooperative female member representative meetings and women's federations at all levels should widely mobilize women to work together with the people of the whole country to ensure the greening of all possible barren hills and wasteland within 12 years and comprehensively complete the afforestation plan.

VIII. Women across the country should actively participate in the work of eliminating the four pests. For the work of eliminating flies, rats, mosquitoes, fleas, lice, bedbugs, etc., which is particularly suitable for women and easy for women to carry out within the family, women should become the main force.

Women's representative meetings at the grassroots level in urban and rural areas and women's federations at all levels should thoroughly publicize to women the serious harm of these pests and harmful birds to production and human health, and disseminate good methods for eliminating rats, mosquitoes, flies, lice, fleas, and bedbugs.

IX. Women across the country should maintain and carry forward the inherent fine tradition of hard work, endurance, diligence, and thrift of Chinese women, and practice thrift. All female members of agricultural production cooperatives should work together with male members to complete the task of accumulating surplus grain for one, one and a half, or two years of consumption within 12 years. When harvesting crops, all rural women must achieve careful harvesting, careful threshing, and careful storage, and try their best not to lose a cotton boll or drop a grain ear. Women across the country should be careful and meticulous in their daily lives, plan their expenses, save and save, and try their best not to waste a grain of rice or a pinch of flour to support national construction.

X. Establishing farm busy season childcare organizations in agricultural cooperatives is an indispensable task for liberating women's labor and protecting children's safety and health.

Village women's representative meetings or cooperative female member representative meetings and women's federations at all levels should actively assist agricultural production cooperatives to establish nurseries (groups), kindergartens (teams) and other organizations in a timely manner according to needs, to ensure that no mother who can work is unable to participate in production labor because her children are not taken care of; and to assist the cooperative to establish the leadership of childcare organizations (such as the childcare committee) to strengthen the specific leadership of nurseries (groups) and kindergartens (teams). Women's federations at the county, district, and township levels should assist relevant departments to train a large number of childcare workers to meet the needs of the development of childcare organizations.

Childcare workers in rural nurseries (groups) and kindergartens (teams) should love children, love their work, actively learn, be proficient in their business; they should often solicit the requirements and opinions of mothers, and constantly improve their work, and strive to become excellent childcare workers, model childcare workers and model educators.

Childcare workers, educators, and mothers should learn new methods of educating children. Cultivate children's communist virtues of loving the motherland, loving the people, loving labor, loving science, and cherishing public property, and cultivate their spirit and will of being brave, honest, lively, and strong; change the past bad attitudes and backward and wrong educational methods of treating children, such as beating, scolding, deceiving, frightening, and spoiling them.

As children's mothers, ensure that children of school age enroll on time. Organize children to participate in labor during spare time and holidays, but do not exceed their physical strength, to ensure that children grow up healthily.

XI. Women across the country should strive to improve environmental hygiene, maternal and child hygiene, and personal hygiene. Women should develop hygienic habits of washing their faces, brushing their teeth, bathing, and washing their hair. Clothes and bedding should be washed and dried frequently, and eating utensils should be washed and brushed frequently, and houses and courtyards should be kept clean. Do not do heavy labor during menstruation, pregnancy, and childbirth. Advocate new methods of raising children, and pay attention to the prevention and care of common children's diseases. Adults and children should not eat rotten things or drink raw water to reduce diseases and protect health. Develop the habit of paying attention to public health.

Women's federations at all levels should assist health departments in training midwives, actively promote new methods of delivery, actively publicize maternal and child health knowledge and parenting knowledge to the vast number of women, and break bad habits that hinder the health of women and children, and strive to reduce the morbidity rate of parturients and the mortality rate of infants.

XII. Women across the country must learn culture with a strong determination and perseverance, in order to get rid of illiteracy within 5 years or 7 years, lay a cultural foundation, and continue to improve their culture on this basis, and achieve a cultural turnaround. To this end, women must overcome all difficulties, actively participate in cultural learning, and ensure that they recognize 1,500 characters as scheduled or ahead of schedule. Women with culture should actively participate in illiteracy eradication and take the initiative to help illiterate women learn to read. Women with many children and heavy housework who cannot participate in illiteracy eradication classes should also overcome difficulties and rely on methods such as sending characters to the door, kang head groups, and individual teaching to achieve the goal of literacy.

Women's federations at all levels should help women solve various difficulties in learning and ensure that women complete illiteracy eradication tasks on time.

XIII. Female members should work together with male members to conscientiously and responsibly supervise, educate, and transform counter-revolutionary elements under control in the society, and also constantly improve revolutionary vigilance and carry out a resolute struggle against counter-revolutionary elements engaged in sabotage activities.

XIV. All female members of agricultural production cooperatives across the country should study hard, care about politics, and actively participate in the political and cultural activities called for by the Party, the League, the cooperative, and the Women's Federation; they should constantly improve their socialist consciousness and strengthen their patriotic ideology; they must recognize the consistency of personal interests, family interests, collective interests, and national interests, establish the collectivist ideology of "loving the community as a home"; they must abide by labor discipline, cherish public property, and become excellent members who work hard in production and care about collective interests.

Village women's representative meetings, cooperative female member representative meetings, and women's federations at all levels should, under the leadership of the Party, assist the cooperative in doing a good job in the political education of female members.

XV. In the high tide of the vast number of rural women actively participating in the socialist transformation of agriculture and the production increase movement, a large number of women activists and outstanding figures will inevitably emerge; therefore, women's federations at all levels must assist the cooperative and attach importance to training women backbones, so that every association has a female president or deputy president, and every team has a female captain or deputy captain, and the number of female committee members, female section chiefs, female technicians, and female accountants is increased year by year in the community management committee and supervision committee.

Cooperative women backbones, production experts, and various model figures must maintain a diligent and conscientious, humble and prudent work style. Do not be inferior, do not be proud, study hard, and constantly improve your ideological level and work ability, and make greater achievements in production and work.

XVI. Female staff members in state-owned farms, state-owned ranches, technology promotion stations, tractor stations, health centers, and health stations should love their work, work hard to study their business, improve their working ability, and better contribute to the construction of a new socialist countryside. Women's federations at all levels should pay attention to cultivating and selecting various talents and recommending them to these positions.

XVII. Women in all positions across the country should actively do a good job in production and work in their respective positions and support the socialist transformation and construction of rural areas. It is necessary to meet the needs of agricultural production development and the requirements of women and children with more and better industrial products, daily necessities, works of art, literary and artistic works, and popular reading materials.

XVIII. Leading organs of women's federations at all levels should improve their leadership methods, improve their leadership level, go deep into reality, approach the masses, cherish the creativity of the masses, and discover and promote advanced experiences in a timely manner. In accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao on "more, better, faster, and more economical," carry out work and unite the vast number of women to strive to implement and realize the National Agricultural Development Program.

    全国妇女为实现“1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要”的奋斗纲要（草案）
    中华全国民主妇女联合会1956年3月8日提出
    中国共产党中央政治局在1956年1月23日向全国人民提出的1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案），是完成我国农业社会主义改造、建设社会主义的新农村的伟大纲领。实现这个纲领是农村妇女走向彻底解放，达到真正的男女平等的根本前提。
    这个纲要鼓舞着全国人民更加积极地在社会主义道路上奋勇前进，促使着农业合作化的高潮和农业生产的高潮进一步地向前发展，推动着我国社会主义工业化加速进行。它的实现，将使全国5亿男女农民都能获得美好幸福的生活。
    为了动员全国妇女在实现全国农业发展纲要的伟大斗争中，更充分地发挥作用，贡献力量。中华全国民主妇女联合会于1956年1月26日到2月4日，召开了各省市妇联主任会议进行了讨论，又分别同河北省来北京开会的一部分县、区委书记、省妇联专区分会主任举行了三次座谈会，然后于3月6日召开了全国妇联常务委员会进行了讨论，制定了这个纲要草案。现在乘全国妇女正在普遍纪念自己的节日——三八国际妇女节的时候，将这一草案公布，要求各级妇女联合会和全国妇女进行广泛深入的讨论，汇集意见，提交全国妇联本年4月以后召开的二届三次全体执行委员会讨论通过。
    一、全国农村妇女都应该认识社会主义道路就是妇女彻底解放的道路，坚决地走合作化的道路。农村妇女积极地加入农业生产合作社，具备了升高级社条件的合作社中的女社员要和男社员一道转入高级社，保证在1958年基本上完成高级形式的农业合作化。盐民、渔民、船民中的妇女要自愿地参加盐民、渔民、船民的合作社，牧民中的妇女要根据本地区合作社的发展计划，和男牧民一道参加畜牧业的合作社。
    乡村妇女代表会议或农业、渔、盐、船、牧合作社女社员代表会议和各级妇联组织应当在妇女群众中广泛深入地进行社会主义、妇女解放、“农业生产合作社示范章程”、全国农业发展纲要以及有关的各种政策的宣传教育，提高妇女群众的社会主义觉悟，使我国农业合作化继续健康地发展，又好又快地完成。
    二、农村妇女要高度地发挥社会主义的积极性，积极参加农业和副业的生产劳动，提高劳动生产率，为达到七年内每一个农村妇女全劳动力每年生产劳动的时间不少于120个工作日而努力。目前在生产劳动中已达到或超过120个工作日的妇女，要在可能条件下为作更多的工作日而努力。没有达到每年作120个工作日的妇女，要争取在7年内达到或提前达到并超过120个工作日。为此，农村妇女要有计划地安排家务，以便在可能条件下以更多的时间参加生产劳动。
    乡村妇女代表会议或农业生产合作社女社员代表会议和各级妇联组织，要协助农业生产合作社的管理委员会，根据男女劳力统一计算、统一安排、统一使用的要求，正确地计算女劳力，将女劳力有计划地编入生产队；并根据妇女的特长和生理特点，切实制定包括男女劳力在内的施工计划，充分发挥妇女的劳动潜力，提高女劳力的劳动利用率。对于能作轻微劳动的妇女，要适当地分配她们力所能及的劳动。对老弱孤寡和缺乏劳力的妇女，要尽可能给她们安排适当的生产和工作，对其中完全丧失劳动能力而又无依靠的，要妥善安置她们的生活。要克服对女劳力不作安排，临时抓用或者是歧视、排斥等不合理的现象。还要协助农业生产合作社的管理委员会根据需要和条件，逐步建立公共磨面坊、碾米坊、缝纫组和农忙食堂等为社员生活服务的设备，以便适当地减轻妇女的家务负担，使女劳力在农业和副业的生产上更好地发挥作用。
    三、为保证完成粮、棉及其他各项农作物增产指标，农村妇女要为实现十大增产措施发挥积极的作用。为此，凡有劳动力的妇女必须学习生产技术，提高操作能力，扩大劳动范围：
