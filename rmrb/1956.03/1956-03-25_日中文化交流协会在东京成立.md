Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 24th: The "Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association" held its inaugural meeting in Tokyo on March 23rd. Approximately 120 prominent figures from Japanese political and cultural circles attended the meeting.

    Tetsu Katayama, chairman of the "National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution," delivered a speech on behalf of the initiators at the meeting. He said, "In international relations, the most important thing between countries is to promote understanding and friendship between the peoples; only in this way can war be avoided. Japan and China have close relations geographically and historically, and there is a long history of cultural and economic exchange." He hoped that this newly formed organization could become a window for promoting cultural exchange between Japan and China.

    The meeting decided on several key tasks for the immediate future, including inviting the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe to perform in Japan, holding Chinese painting and sculpture exhibitions in Tokyo and Osaka, holding a commemorative meeting for the 20th anniversary of Lu Xun's death, holding a Japanese film viewing and art exhibition in China, exchanging representatives from cultural circles in both countries, and establishing a Japan-China Cultural Center in Japan. The meeting concluded with the election of Tetsu Katayama as the association's president, Kenzo Nakajima as the chairman of the board, Koichi Ohno as the director of the secretariat, and 110 people as directors of the association.
