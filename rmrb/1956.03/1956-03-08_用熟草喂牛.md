Feeding Cattle with Cooked Grass
    Recently, Kuandian County, Liaoning Province, has promoted a method of raising cattle: "Feeding cooked grass and drinking warm water." More than 100 agricultural cooperatives in the county are trying this method of feeding cattle. Experiments have confirmed that cooked grass is softer than raw grass, cattle like to eat it, and it is easier to digest. Giving cattle warm water to drink keeps them from getting cold. Using this method to feed cattle can enhance their physical strength. In the past month, the Dengta Agricultural Cooperative in Xialu District of this county has used this method to feed cattle. More than 300 calves are eating heartily and looking robust, and more than 30 weak cattle that could not stand up are now able to stand up and eat grass. This method of feeding cattle can also save a lot of feed. According to calculations, if Kuandian County fully adopts this method of feeding cattle, it can solve the problem of insufficient livestock feed that has plagued the area for years.

    用熟草喂牛
    辽宁省宽甸县最近推广了一种“熟草喂、温水饮”的饲养耕牛的方法。全县100多个农业合作社都在试用这种方法喂牛。经过试验，证实煮熟的草比生草软，牛爱吃，并且好消化。用温水饮牛，牛喝了不冷。用这种方法喂牛，可以增强耕牛体力。这个县的下露区灯塔农业合作社最近一个月采用了这种方法喂牛，300多头小牛吃得龙头虎眼，30多头瘦弱的站不起来的牛，也能站起来吃草了。用这种方法喂牛还可以节省很多饲草。据计算，宽甸县如果全部采用这种方法喂牛，就可以解决历年牲畜草料不足的问题。
