The Hongxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Lushan County, Henan Province, has 80% of its pigs not kept in pens; there are very few public toilets; and individual fertilizer accumulation is also not good. Zhang Tianyu, a member of the cooperative, used to accumulate at least 28 cartloads of fertilizer per year when he was working individually, but now his whole family only accumulates half a cartload per month. Many agricultural production cooperatives in Hebei Province also have similar situations in their fertilizer accumulation work. In some areas, cooperatives and teams are scrambling for fertilizer sources. Some fertilizers that can be used locally are being transported to other cultivated areas. The work quotas and remuneration standards for fertilizer accumulation are also not reasonable enough; in order to get more remuneration, cooperative members only care about the size of the fertilizer pile and not about the quality of the fertilizer.

In order to meet the needs of increased production this year, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the agricultural cooperatives' fertilizer accumulation work; to transform unplanned and short-term crash programs of fertilizer accumulation into planned and regular fertilizer accumulation. Attention should be paid to solving the problem of remuneration for fertilizer accumulation. Only by stipulating reasonable fertilizer accumulation work quotas and remuneration standards can we maintain and improve the enthusiasm of cooperative members for accumulating fertilizer.

    领导农民经常积肥
    河南鲁山县红星农业生产合作社，80％的猪没有圈；公共厕所很少；个人积肥的情况也不好。社员张天玉家，在单干的时候，每年最少要积28车肥，现在全家每个月只积半车肥。河北省不少农业生产合作社，在积肥工作中，也有类似情况。有的地区社和社，队和队乱争肥源。有些可以就地使用的肥料，被运到了另外的耕作区。积肥的工作定额和报酬标准也不够合理；社员为了多得报酬，只顾肥料堆大，不顾肥料好坏。
    为了适应今年增产的需要，必须加强对农业合作社积肥工作的领导；使无计划的和短期突击的积肥，转变为有计划的和经常的积肥。应当注意解决积肥的报酬问题。只有规定了合理的积肥工作定额和报酬标准，才能保持和提高社员积肥的积极性。
