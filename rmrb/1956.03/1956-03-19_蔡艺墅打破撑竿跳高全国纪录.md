Cai Yishu Breaks National Pole Vault Record

The national pole vault record, which had stood for 20 years, was broken on the 17th by 19-year-old athlete Cai Yishu at the Beijing Institute of Physical Education track and field meet held in Shanghai. Cai Yishu's result was 4 meters 3.5 centimeters, 2 centimeters higher than the record held by Fu Baolu.

At the track and field meet held that day, three other people broke the national records for women's long jump, women's discus throw, and men's long jump, respectively. Shi Baozhu, the national record holder for women's discus, threw the discus a distance of 46 meters 89 centimeters, 97 centimeters further than her own record. This result is also 60 centimeters further than the third-place result at the 15th Olympic Games in 1952.
