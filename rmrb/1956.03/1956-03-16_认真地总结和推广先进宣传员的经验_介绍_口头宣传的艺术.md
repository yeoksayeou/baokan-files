    Seriously Summarize and Promote the Experiences of Advanced Propagandists
    —Introducing “The Art of Oral Propaganda”—
    Li Weiguang
    "The Art of Oral Propaganda" (published by Liaoning People's Publishing House) is a booklet worth recommending to propaganda workers. The book is quite lively. It interestingly introduces, like a story, the experiences of Bai Xiyan, a propagandist from the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory, in conducting oral propaganda. Such vivid and visualized summaries of propaganda work experience have been rare in the past year or two.
    This booklet presents us with some basic principles and methods for doing a good job in oral propaganda. One of the main experiences of Bai Xiyan's propaganda work is that he is good at explaining principles and making analyses based on the life experiences of the masses. To achieve this, it is necessary to find the most prominent and appropriate examples from the masses for specific and detailed propaganda, rather than adopting a crude attitude and simple methods. Before talking with worker Sun Shuting, Bai Xiyan conducted a lot of investigation and analysis, such as the central issue of the conversation, the other person's political consciousness, personality, and work performance, what specific examples could move him, what difficult questions the other person might raise in the conversation, and so on. With such mental preparation, he was able to convince Sun Shuting with reason when he talked to him. Bai Xiyan, unlike some comrades who are not good at propaganda, did not just want to subdue the masses with big labels, but used the truth familiar to the workers to carry out patient persuasion and education.
    Another important experience of Bai Xiyan in doing oral propaganda is that his methods are flexible and his language is vivid. He can tell stories, calculate detailed accounts, and also tell fables and use metaphors. He also uses cartoons as his assistant. His propaganda language is very rich. It not only makes people understand as soon as they hear it, but also can be fascinating. His propaganda has no Party jargon, it's not the same old stuff, so people will never get a headache listening to it. Here is an excerpt from his conversation with Sun Shuting as an example.
    Bai: "I think there are still people eating cold rice in our factory now."
    Sun: "If he wants to eat it himself, who can control him!"
    Bai: "It's not that he wants to eat it himself, but he is forced to."
    Sun: "Who is forcing whom? Tell me!"
    Bai: "Today, some of us only care about our own happiness, but let the machines suffer. We don't know that without them, there would be no our happiness; of course, I am not saying that anyone has forced the steam hammer to eat cold rice. I mean that some people often force the steam hammer to eat cold iron. I think if it could speak and walk, it would have gone to the people's court to sue us."
    Sun: "So you are still talking about 'striking cold iron'!"
    Look! How skillfully Bai Xiyan said this last paragraph! How close his feelings of being the master of state property are revealed! If a propagandist does not have this kind of vivid language, how can he move people's hearts? Kalinin said: "Language is everything to an agitator!" This is a problem that deserves our attention.
    In addition, from the booklet "The Art of Oral Propaganda", we can also learn an important method of leading propaganda work. That is, we should go deep into the masses, carefully summarize the experiences of several advanced propagandists, and promote them. Specifically introducing the experiences of advanced propagandists is the most powerful way to prove whether propagandists can play a role. This is more convincing than talking about the importance of the propaganda network in a general way. Those who say, "With Party and League members doing propaganda, what else do we need propagandists for?" and those who say, "The masses don't like to listen to cadres' speeches, let alone propagandists' speeches" should change these arguments after reading Bai Xiyan's propaganda experience. These comrades only saw the negative and backward side of the propagandists' work, but did not discover and grasp the advanced and positive factors in it, to strengthen the leadership of the propagandists and give play to the role of the propagandists; even when the propagandists had a profound impact on the masses and created and accumulated a lot of rich propaganda experience, they still glanced over it, or did not know it at all. The Propaganda Department of the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee and the Party organization of the Pneumatic Tool Factory first paid attention to breaking this conservative ideology of obliterating the advanced and tolerating the backward. They deeply summarized and promoted the experience of the propagandist Bai Xiyan, and then continued to discover and summarize some advanced propaganda models in factories and enterprises throughout the city. In this way, they launched a wave of learning from advanced models and eliminating backward air in propaganda work, thereby guiding propaganda work onto a normal path of progress.
    At present, the booklet "The Art of Oral Propaganda" has attracted the attention of some places. Many comrades who lead propaganda work feel that they must trust the masses, not ignore new forces, and the work of the propaganda network must be strengthened. Many propagandists have increased their confidence in doing propaganda work after reading this book. We hope that every province and city in the country can, like the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee, specifically help the Party committees of factories discover advanced elements in local propaganda work, summarize their advanced experiences, and promote them universally. This is of great significance for further improving the ideological and political level of propaganda work and improving the leadership methods of propaganda work.

    认真地总结和推广先进宣传员的经验
    ——介绍“口头宣传的艺术”——
    李维光
    “口头宣传的艺术”（辽宁人民出版社出版）是值得向宣传工作者普遍推荐的一本小册子。这本书写得相当生动，它像讲故事一样有趣地介绍了沈阳市风动工具厂宣传员白锡彦进行口头宣传的经验。像这样生动的、形象化的宣传工作经验总结，近一、两年来是并不多见的。
    这个小册子给我们提出了做好口头宣传的一些基本原则和方法。白锡彦宣传工作中的主要经验之一，就是善于根据群众的生活经验，讲道理，作分析。要作到这一点，就需要从群众中找出最显著、最恰当的例子，来进行具体的细致的宣传，而不是采用粗暴的态度和简单的方法。白锡彦和工人孙书亭谈话以前，曾作了许多调查和分析，比如谈话的中心问题，对方的政治觉悟、个性和工作表现，用什么具体事例才能打动他的心，在谈话中对方可能提出哪些疑难的问题，等等。有了这样的思想准备，他和孙书亭谈起话来，才能够以理服人。白锡彦不像有些不善于做宣传的同志那样，只是想拿大帽子压服群众，而是拿工人所熟悉的真理，去进行耐心的说服教育。
    白锡彦做口头宣传的另一条重要经验，就是方法灵活，语言生动。他会讲故事、算细账，也会说寓言、打比方，还会利用漫画来做他的助手。他的宣传语言是十分丰富的。不但使人一听就懂，而且能够引人入胜。他的宣传，没有党八股气，不是老一套，使人听起来绝不会头痛。这里举出他和孙书亭的一段对话来做例子。
    白：“我看现在我们厂子里还有吃冷饭的。”
    孙：“如果他自己愿意吃，那谁还管得了！”
    白：“不是自己愿意吃，是被迫的。”
    孙：“谁强迫谁？你说！”
    白：“今天我们有一些人只关心自己的幸福，却叫机器去受罪，不知道没有它们就没有我们的幸福；当然我并不是说谁强迫过汽锤吃冷饭，我是说有些人常常去强迫汽锤吃冷铁。我看它若是会说话、会走路，早就到人民法院去控告我们了。”
    孙：“原来你还是说‘打冷铁’呀！”
    看！白锡彦最后这一段谈话，说得多么巧妙！他对国家财产的主人翁感情，流露得多么亲切啊！宣传员如果没有这种生动的语言，又怎么能够打动人心呢？加里宁说过：“语言对鼓动员来说就是一切！”这是很值得我们注意的一个问题。
    此外，从“口头宣传的艺术”这个小册子中，我们还可以学到一种领导宣传工作的重要方法。这就是应该深入群众，认真总结几个先进的宣传员的经验，并加以推广。具体地介绍先进宣传员的经验，是证明宣传员能不能起作用的最有力的方法，这比空泛地谈论宣传网的重要性是更能信服人的。那些说“有了党、团员做宣传，还要宣传员干什么”的人，说“干部讲话群众都不爱听，宣传员讲话群众就更不爱听了”的人，看了白锡彦的宣传经验，应该改变这些论调了吧。这些同志只看到了宣传员工作中的消极落后的一面，而没有发现和抓住其中先进的、积极的因素，去加强对宣传员的领导，发挥宣传员的作用；甚至当宣传员在群众中发生了深远的影响，创造和积累了许多丰富的宣传经验的时候，他们还是一掠而过，或者根本不知道。沈阳市委宣传部和风动工具厂的党组织首先注意打破了这种抹煞先进、容忍落后的保守思想，他们深入地总结和推广了宣传员白锡彦的经验，接着又在全市工厂企业中继续发现和总结了一些先进的宣传范例，这样就在宣传工作中掀起了学习先进的榜样，消除落后的空气，从而把宣传工作引向了正常的前进的道路。
    目前“口头宣传的艺术”这个小册子，已经引起了有些地方的注意。许多领导宣传工作的同志，都感到必须相信群众，不能忽视新生力量，宣传网的工作是必须加强的。许多宣传员看了这本书，增加了做宣传工作的信心。我们希望全国每个省、市都能像沈阳市委那样，具体帮助工厂党委发现当地宣传工作中的先进分子，总结他们的先进经验，普遍推广。这对进一步提高宣传工作的思想政治水平，改善宣传工作的领导方法，都是有重大意义的。
