The Liangzhuang Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shunyi County, Hebei Province, originally planned to build more than 40 rooms for offices, warehouses, livestock sheds, etc. It also planned to buy many tables, benches, saddles, rope sets, and other utensils. The total expenditure was estimated to be over 12,500 yuan. Converted into grain, each of the more than 700 households in the cooperative would have had an income reduction of 200 jin of grain.

Recently, after the cooperative director attended the meeting of cooperative directors convened by the county party committee, he checked the cooperative's expenditure plan with all the cooperative members and called on the members to save expenses and do a good job in production. The members came up with many ways to save expenses. Liu Caisheng, a member of the Fourth Production Team, built eight livestock sheds by using sorghum stalks on his courtyard wall and plastering them with mud. The Fifth Production Team rented three rooms from a member for 25 yuan to use as a livestock shed. The Second Production Team borrowed a house from member Xiao Fubi to use as an office. The teams generally checked the rope sets and adopted the method of "use if possible, modify if possible, match if possible," saving money on buying rope sets. The members also went up the mountain to quarry stones for well-drilling stone. Some things that were not needed for production were decided not to be bought for the time being. In this way, the cooperative only needs to spend 1,190 yuan. Judging from the situation of the Liangzhuang Township Cooperative, as long as everyone thinks of ways, it is possible to get things done well with less money.

    少花钱也能把事办好
    河北省顺义县梁庄乡农业生产合作社，原来计划盖办公室、仓库、牲口棚等共四十多间房子。还计划买很多桌子、凳子、鞍子、绳套等用具。总计要开支一万二千五百多元，折成粮食，全社七百多户社员每户就要少收入二百斤粮食。
    最近社主任参加了县委召开的社主任会议以后，同全体社员检查了社的开支计划，号召社员们节约开支，搞好生产。社员们想了很多办法来节约开支。第四生产队社员刘才生把自己的院墙搭上秫秸，抹上泥，搭成了八间牲口棚；第五生产队用二十五元租用了社员三间房作了牲口棚；第二生产队借用社员肖福毕的房子做了办公室；各队普遍检查了绳套，采用“能使就使，能改就改，能配就配”的办法，节省了买绳套的钱。社员们还上山开采石头，作打井用的石料。一些生产不需要的东西，决定暂时不买。这样，全社只开支1，190元就够了。从梁庄乡合作社的情况看来，只要大家想办法，少花钱也能把事办好。
