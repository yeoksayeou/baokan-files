Newly Built Rural Roads in Minority Areas
By our reporter Liu Xi

Standing on Dog Head Mountain and looking east, one sees a vast expanse of fields. In the middle of the fields, white, slender ribbons stretch out, connecting many villages. These are the rural roads newly built by the farmers of Sandu District, Huishui Buyi and Miao Autonomous County, Guizhou Province.

Sandu District achieved agricultural cooperativization in January, and the farmers' enthusiasm for socialist construction is unprecedentedly high. In one month, the Buyi, Miao, and Han farmers here built 156 li of rural roads. There are roads leading to the mountains for chopping firewood, grazing cattle, and cutting grass, and roads to the fields for working. Out of the eleven townships in the district, nine have roads connecting the villages. Trees have also been planted on both sides of the roads.

Guizhou is said to have "no three li of flat land." In the past, the farmers of Sandu District, like farmers elsewhere, walked on field ridges and winding mountain paths. On these field ridges and mountain cliffs, cattle legs were injured, grain was overturned, and quarrels and fights occurred over right-of-way. Now, farmers walk side by side on the roads, chatting and laughing as they go to meetings, markets, or fields. The Sanhe Agricultural Production Cooperative, newly expanded to more than 400 households, can use carts and livestock to transport the fertilizer accumulated in the "10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu" campaign to the fields, saving a lot of labor compared to carrying it by people in the past. Last year, this district had two double-wheeled double-furrow plows, which required four people to carry them down to the fields when plowing. This year, 130 double-wheeled double-furrow plows and many other new-style farm tools have been ordered. The farmers said: With rural roads, we no longer need four people to carry new-style farm tools.

    少数民族地区新修的乡村马路
    本报记者　刘希
    站在狗头山上，向东望去，是一片广阔的田野。在田野中间，伸展出一条条白色的细长的飘带，把许多村庄连接起来。这是贵州省惠水布依、苗族自治县三都区农民自己新修的乡村马路。
    三都区在一月份实现了农业合作化，农民们的社会主义建设热情空前高涨。在一个月的时间内，这里的布依、苗、汉族农民就兴修了156华里的乡村马路。有通往山上砍柴、放牛、割草的路，有下田做活的路。全区共十一个乡，已经有九个乡村村通了马路。马路两边还都种了树。
    贵州有“地无三里平”的说法。过去三都区的农民也和其他地方的农民一样，走的是田坎和弯弯曲曲的山道。在这些田坎上、山崖上曾经跌伤过牛腿，磕翻过粮食，也发生过互不让路争吵打架的事情。现在，农民们开会、赶场、下田，有说有笑地肩并肩在马路上走着。新扩大的四百多户人家的三合农业生产合作社，在“每亩田万斤肥”的运动中积的肥料，可以用马车和牲口向田地里运送，比过去用人挑节约了大量的劳动力。去年这个区有两部双轮双铧犁，犁田的时候，需要四个人抬着下田；今年订购了一百三十架双轮双铧犁和许多其他的新式农具，农民们说：有了乡村马路，使用新式农具再也不用四个人抬了。
