    In recent days, spring rain has fallen widely in most parts of our country. On the 15th and 16th, the total precipitation in Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, northern Fujian, and northern Jiangsu generally ranged from 15 to 25 millimeters. In some individual areas, such as the Changwei Special District on both sides of the Shandong Peninsula and the Jiaoji Railway, Yueyang in Hunan, Luoyang in Henan, and Ganzhou in Jiangxi, the total precipitation has exceeded 35 millimeters. In addition, the total precipitation in southern Shanxi and southern Hebei is also around 10 to 15 millimeters.
    This precipitation is beneficial to the lower reaches of the Yellow River and the Huai River Basin, which had been experiencing drought due to lack of rain. At the same time, it is also very beneficial to spring plowing and sowing and to promoting the growth of winter wheat.

    大部地区普降春雨
    近几天以来，我国大部地区先后普降春雨。在15、16两天中，山东、河南、湖北、湖南、安徽、浙江、江西、福建北部和江苏北部等地降水总量一般都在15到25公厘左右，其中个别地区，如山东半岛和胶济铁路两侧的昌潍专区、湖南岳阳、河南洛阳、江西赣州等地，降水总量已超过35公厘。另外，山西、河北南部，降水总量也在10公厘到15公厘左右。
    这次降水对过去因缺雨而呈现旱象的黄河下游、淮河流域带来好处。同时对春耕播种和促使冬麦成长也非常有利。　　　　　（新华社）
