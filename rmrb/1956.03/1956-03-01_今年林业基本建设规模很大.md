    This Year's Forestry Capital Construction Scale is Very Large
    This year, the national forestry capital construction building and installation engineering volume will increase by 44.7% compared to last year. 13 logging enterprises, including Changbai Mountain, Greater Khingan Range, and Lesser Khingan Range, will build 888 kilometers of forest railways and 208 kilometers of flatcar tracks this year. Various forest industry departments will also build 582 kilometers of highways this year. The forest railway engineering volume alone will increase by 92.6% compared to last year.
    In order to expand timber production, the Ministry of Forestry will also build 2 new forest industry logging enterprises this year, adding 103 main logging workshops and hundreds of tractors and winches. This will enable the 7 forest industry bureaus to achieve mechanized operations from logging, timber gathering, and timber transportation to timber storage yards. (Mei Fengxiang)

    今年林业基本建设规模很大
    今年全国林业基本建设建筑安装工程量将比去年增加44.7％。长白山、大兴安岭、小兴安岭等13个采伐企业，今年将新建888公里森林铁路，208公里平车道。各森林工业部门今年还将修建582公里公路。其中仅森林铁路的工程量，就比去年增大92.6％。
    为了扩大木材的生产量，林业部今年还将新建2个森林工业采伐企业，增加103个主伐车间和数百台拖拉机、绞盘机。这样将使7个森林工业局从采伐、集材、运材到贮木场全部实现机械化作业。（梅凤祥）
