Jiangsu Province has organized an agricultural scientific and technical team of 5,590 people, divided into areas and set up points to strengthen the technical guidance work for the province's 25 million mu of land reform cultivation system and large-scale high-yield production.

The Jiangsu Provincial People's Committee established the Agricultural Science and Technology Guidance Committee on March 4. Five central groups were also established for double-cropping rice, indica rice to japonica rice conversion, miscellaneous grains, cotton, and mountain afforestation. According to the agricultural season, they will go deep into practice to provide technical guidance.

The province has transferred a total of 590 staff members from the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, various agricultural experiment stations, the East China Agricultural Science Research Institute, and students from various secondary agricultural schools who have advanced their internships and graduations. They will depart in mid-March to the base counties and general areas under the control of the five central groups to cooperate with cadres in charge of special zones, counties, and districts, and more than 5,000 cadres from technical guidance stations above the district level to inspect and promote the current field management of summer-ripe crops and spring plowing preparations. They will also systematically summarize mass experiences, strengthen scientific research, and combine agricultural science and technology with mass experience to ensure large-scale high yields.
