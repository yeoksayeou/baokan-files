Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 20th: The Indonesian "People's Daily" published on March 19th a statement by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia regarding the formation of the new cabinet.

    The statement said that after the collapse of the reactionary Harahap cabinet, President Sukarno, in accordance with the wishes of the people, appointed Sastroamidjojo, one of the leaders of the Indonesian National Party, as the organizer of the new cabinet. The people had hoped that Sastroamidjojo would be able to form a progressive government in accordance with the wishes they expressed in the general election, a government that could improve the political situation and the lives of the people. They had demanded that a progressive and democratic program should be formulated first, and that this program should be the basis for the establishment of a progressive cabinet. When formulating the program, Sastroamidjojo satisfied the wishes and demands of the majority of the people at the present stage. This program is almost close to the kind of program that a progressive government should have. This is why the Communist Party of Indonesia was able to agree to the program drafted by the cabinet organizer.

    The statement said that, however, after starting consultations on the composition and personnel of the cabinet, the cabinet organizer, Sastroamidjojo, clearly failed to meet the wishes and demands of the people. On the contrary, the people were greatly disappointed. In order to ensure the smooth implementation of the program, the Communist Party of Indonesia requested that the Masyumi Party not be allowed to participate in the cabinet. Otherwise, if the Masyumi Party eventually joined the government, it would be reasonable for the Communist Party to participate in the cabinet. The statement pointed out, however, that the fact is that the Masyumi Party and some of its figures who are not sincere in implementing the above-mentioned program, or who may even undermine it, have been included in this cabinet.

    The statement said that the Masyumi Party leaders' agreement to the program drafted by Sastroamidjojo was not sincere. This is evidenced by the fact that the Masyumi Party unreasonably refused to allow the Communist Party and other non-party members to participate in the cabinet. These people could do their best to implement the program and gain the support of the broad masses who voted for the Communist Party of Indonesia in the general election. The Masyumi Party's attitude is yet another proof of its anti-democratic and anti-unity nature.

    The statement said that the people hoped that the Indonesian National Party and the Nahdlatul Ulama would adopt a firm attitude. These two parties had taken a firm and clear stand on the Masyumi Party during the Ali-Arifin cabinet period, and especially in the process of overthrowing the Harahap cabinet. However, when organizing the new cabinet, it turned out that they did not take such an attitude. Therefore, the Indonesian National Party and the Nahdlatul Ulama have directly or indirectly condoned the reactionaries to lead our democratic life away from the direction of normal development.

    The statement said that the attitude of the Communist Party of Indonesia towards the new cabinet will depend entirely on what steps the cabinet will take to implement its program. However, it can already be determined that as long as there are leaders of the Masyumi Party in the cabinet, it will inevitably encounter serious obstacles in implementing its program.

    The statement concluded by saying that the Communist Party of Indonesia calls on all Indonesian people, regardless of party affiliation, group, or religious belief, to cooperate more closely, to constantly demand the improvement of the composition of the cabinet and demand better cabinet personnel, and to constantly pay attention to the cabinet's implementation of its program. The Communist Party of Indonesia demands that the new parliament exercise the most appropriate and strict supervision over the cabinet.

    印度尼西亚共产党关于新阁的声明
    新华社雅加达20日电　印度尼西亚“人民日报”三月十九日刊载了印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会关于成立新内阁问题的声明。
    声明说，苏加诺总统在反动的哈拉哈普内阁垮台以后依照了人民的愿望任命印度尼西亚国民党的领袖之一沙斯特罗阿米佐约为新内阁的组织人。人民曾经希望，沙斯特罗阿米佐约将能够按照他们在普选中所表现出来的意愿组成进步的政府，这个政府能改善政治形势和人民的生活。他们曾要求首先应该拟订出进步的和民主的政纲，并且把这个政纲当做成立进步的内阁的基础。沙斯特罗阿米佐约在拟订政纲的时候满足了大多数人民在目前阶段的愿望和要求。这个政纲差不多接近了一个进步政府应该有的那种政纲。这就是印度尼西亚共产党为什么能够同意组阁人所拟订的这种政纲的原因。
    声明说，但是，在开始协商内阁成份和人员以后，组阁人沙斯特罗阿米佐约显然没有满足人民的愿望和要求，相反地，人民感到大失所望。为了保证顺利地履行政纲，印度尼西亚共产党曾要求不要让马斯友美党参加内阁。不然的话，如果马斯友美党终于参加政府，让共产党参加内阁才是合理的。声明指出，但是事实却是马斯友美党和这个党的一些没有诚意执行上述政纲的、甚至会破坏这一个政纲的人物都被包括在这个内阁中。
   声明说，马斯友美党领袖们的同意沙斯特罗阿米佐约拟订的政纲并不是出于真心诚意的。这一点由下述事实得到了证明：马斯友美党毫无理由地拒绝让共产党和其他无党派人士参加内阁，他们是能够尽最大的力量来实施政纲并且使内阁得到在普选中投印度尼西亚共产党的票的广大群众的支持。马斯友美党的这种态度是它的反民主反团结的性质的又一个证据。
    声明说，人民希望印度尼西亚国民党和印度尼西亚回教师联合会会采取坚决的态度，这两个党在阿里—阿里芬内阁时期以及特别在推翻哈拉哈普内阁的过程中，曾经在对待马斯友美党方面采取了坚定而明确的立场。但是，在组织新内阁的时候，事实证明它们并没有采取这样的态度。因此，印度尼西亚国民党和印度尼西亚回教师联合会已经直接或间接地纵容了反动派把我们的民主生活带到脱离正常发展的方向。
    声明说，印度尼西亚共产党对新内阁的态度，将完全取决于内阁将采取什么步骤来实行它的政纲。但是，已经可以断定，只要在内阁中有马斯友美党的领袖，在实现它的政纲的时候就不可能不遇到严重的障碍。
    声明最后说，因此，印度尼西亚共产党号召全体印度尼西亚人民，不分党派团体或宗教信仰，更加紧密地合作，不断要求改善内阁的成份和要求有较好的内阁人员，并且不断注意内阁执行政纲的情况。印度尼西亚共产党要求新国会对内阁实行最适当的和严密的监督。
