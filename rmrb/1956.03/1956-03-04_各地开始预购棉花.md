Cotton pre-purchasing work in major cotton-producing areas such as Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Henan provinces has been assigned to the county level, and most areas have completed pre-purchase pilot programs. Regions with faster progress have already signed pre-purchase contracts with agricultural production cooperatives.

In arranging pre-purchasing work, various localities generally ensure close integration with current agricultural planning and production. For example, in Dezhou Prefecture, Shandong Province, some counties distributed the work through three-level meetings of county, district, and township cadres, while others did so at district head or district committee meetings. Huimin Prefecture disseminated the information through meetings of county purchasing bureau chiefs, district secretaries, district supply and marketing cooperative directors, purchasing stations, township heads, and agricultural production cooperative chairpersons. In areas where pre-purchase contracts have been signed, meetings of key township and village cadres and agricultural cooperative chairpersons are generally held first, and cotton pre-purchasing is implemented through current agricultural production. Agricultural cooperatives hold committee meetings, inviting individual farmers to participate, to study measures for increasing production and to rationally allocate deposits and goods in kind. Mass meetings are held to explain the pre-purchase policy and educate farmers to conserve cotton and sell surplus cotton to the state. Many purchasing stations closely integrate pre-purchase publicity with the organization of mobile purchasing teams to acquire cotton in villages. Supply and marketing cooperatives combine deposit issuance with the organization of material supply, which is welcomed by farmers.

    各地开始预购棉花
    本报讯　全国各主要产棉区河北、山东、江苏、浙江、河南等省的棉花预购工作均已布置到县，并大部分结束了预购试点工作，进展较快的地区已和农业生产合作社签订了预购合同。
    各地在布置预购工作的方法上，一般都作到了同当前的农业规划和农业生产密切结合。如山东省德州专区各县，有的是通过县、区、乡三级干部会议向下布置的，有的是在区长或区委会上布置的。惠民专区是通过县采购局长会议、区书、区供销合作社主任、采购站、乡长及农业生产合作社社长等会议传达布置的。在已签订预购合同的地区，一般都是首先召开乡、村主要干部和农业合作社社长会议，通过当前农业生产贯彻棉花预购工作；以农业合作社为单位召开社务委员会并吸收单干农民参加，研究增产措施和定金、实物的合理分配；召开群众大会讲解预购政策，并教育农民节约用棉，把余棉卖给国家。不少收购站密切结合预购工作的宣传，组织了流动收购小组到村收购棉花；供销合作社则结合定金的发放组织了物资供应，受到了农民的欢迎。
