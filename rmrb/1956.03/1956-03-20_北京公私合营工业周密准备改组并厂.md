Xinhua News Agency, March 17th -- Some of the joint state-private enterprises in Beijing, which have been approved for production reorganization, have all formulated specific action plans to ensure that the production reorganization work is carried out in an orderly manner.

The relevant industrial professional companies, based on the principles of benefiting production and facilitating employees, have re-examined and revised the selection of workshops and factory buildings, the layout of machines, the allocation of labor, the arrangement of canteens, dormitories, and female workers' nursing rooms for the factories to be relocated and merged, and have created charts and instructions. In order not to disrupt the relationship between production and sales, each factory must make arrangements with the original supply and sales units before the relocation and merger. Units that continue to produce at the original address but are managed uniformly by the core factory will temporarily have sales personnel to handle orders.

The action plans of various industries include specific relocation and merger times for each factory. Before relocation and merger in weaving, ribbon, and other industries, installation and production conditions are prepared in the factory buildings in order to achieve simultaneous relocation, installation, and production. Some employees in the electrical appliance and medical equipment industries are preparing to use holidays to relocate and merge factories, ensuring that production and factory mergers are not delayed.

Weaving, knitting, ribbon, and other industries have specifically established factory merger committees composed of representatives from the state, private sector, and workers to uniformly manage the reorganization work. Provisions have also been made in the plan for the arrangement of personnel.

Since the beginning of this year, the Beijing Municipal People's Committee has successively approved the production reorganization plans for thirteen industries such as dyeing and finishing, and seventeen types of joint state-private industries such as woodwork and furniture.

    北京公私合营工业周密准备改组并厂
    新华社17日讯　北京市一些已经被批准进行生产改组的公私合营企业，都订出了具体行动计划，使生产改组工作有秩序地进行。
    各有关工业专业公司对要迁并的工厂，根据有利于生产、便利职工的原则，把车间厂房的选定、机器地位的布置、劳动力的配备、食堂宿舍和女工哺乳室的安排等，都重新作了审订，并且作出图表和说明。为了不打乱产销关系，各厂在迁并以前，都要向原来的供销单位作好交代。仍在原来地址生产、而经营统一于核心厂的单位，暂时都设有供销人员接办订货。
    各行业行动计划中，都安排了各厂的具体迁并时间，织布、绦带等行业迁并前，在厂房里都准备好安装和生产的条件，以便做到边迁移、边安装、边生产。电器、医疗器械等行业有的职工准备利用休假日迁厂并厂等办法，保证生产并厂两不误。
    织布、针织、绦带等行业专门成立了由公方、私方和工人代表组成的并厂委员会，统一管理改组工作。对人员的安排，计划中也作了规定。
    从今年以来，北京市人民委员会已先后批准了织染等十三个行业和木器、家具等十七个类型公私合营工业的生产改组规划。
