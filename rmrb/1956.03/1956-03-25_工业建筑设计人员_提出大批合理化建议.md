Industrial building design institutes affiliated with the Ministry of Construction are enthusiastically launching socialist emulation campaigns. In the past two months or so, design personnel have put forward a large number of rationalization proposals, which have played a significant role in accelerating the design progress and improving the design quality. The Beijing Industrial Building Design Institute proposed more than 400 rationalization proposals in February alone. For example, the adoption of prefabricated drawing methods can increase drawing efficiency by three to five times. Design institutes generally attach importance to promoting advanced experience in the competition, and many design institutes have also held exhibitions to introduce advanced experience. In the first quarter, the Southwest Industrial Building Design Institute used standard drawings and repeated use of drawings for approximately 80% of the total construction area.

Due to the in-depth development of the socialist emulation campaign, the design tasks of various design institutes in January and February have been completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the quota. The Northwest Industrial Building Design Institute completed 128.58% of its monthly plan in February, and it is expected that the drawing output rate in the first quarter can be increased by 206% compared with the original plan.

    工业建筑设计人员
    提出大批合理化建议
    建筑工程部所属各工业建筑设计院热烈地展开了社会主义竞赛。近两个多月来，设计人员提出大量合理化建议，对加快设计进度、提高设计质量起很大作用。北京工业建筑设计院在二月份内共提出合理化建议四百多条。如装配式绘图方法被采用后，可以提高绘图效率三倍到五倍。各设计院在竞赛中普遍重视推广先进经验，许多设计院还举行了介绍先进经验的展览会。西南工业建筑设计院第一季度利用标准图和重复使用图纸的建筑面积约占全部任务的80％。
    由于社会主义竞赛的深入展开，各设计院一、二月份的设计任务都已提前和超额完成。西北工业建筑设计院二月份完成了月计划128.58％，预计第一季度的出图率可以比原计划提高206％。
