Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, March 1st (TASS) - The "Flag" newspaper reported that the Lebanese authorities have received notifications from the United States, Britain, and France: the United States and Britain's fleets in the Mediterranean have been ordered to blockade the coastlines of Arab countries and Israel. The land borders of countries in the region will be supervised by the United Nations Palestine Conciliation Commission, which will be strengthened. The motivation for implementing this blockade, which violates the sovereignty of Middle Eastern countries, is said to be out of a desire to prevent the security of the region from being undermined and is based on the declaration issued by the Western Three Powers in 1950.

It is remembered that the declaration issued by the United States, Britain, and France on May 25, 1950, was an attempt to interfere in the affairs of Near and Middle Eastern countries and was resolutely opposed at the time. Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Iraq, and Jordan stated in a joint reply to the Three-Power Declaration on June 21, 1950: "They will prevent any actions that infringe upon their sovereignty and independence."

    美英两国海军奉命采取
    侵犯中东国家主权的行动
    新华社2日讯　塔斯社贝鲁特1日讯：“旗帜报”报道，黎巴嫩当局已经接到美国、英国和法国的通知：美国和英国在地中海的舰队已经奉命封锁阿拉伯国家和以色列的海岸线。这一地区各国的陆上边界将由联合国巴勒斯坦调解委员会负责监督，这个委员会将予以加强。实行这种侵犯中东国家主权的封锁的动机，据说是出于防止这个地区的安全遭到破坏的愿望，并且是根据西方三国在1950年发表的宣言。
    大家记得，美、英、法三国在1950年5月25日发表的宣言是干涉近东和中东国家事务的一种企图，在当时曾经遭到坚决的反对。埃及、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、沙特阿拉伯、也门、伊拉克和约旦在1950年6月21日发表的对三国宣言的联合答复中声明：“它们将制止侵犯它们的主权和独立的任何行动”。
