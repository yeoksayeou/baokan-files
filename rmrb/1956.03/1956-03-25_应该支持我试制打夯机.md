    Should Support My Rammer Trial Production
    Shi Jiewu, Technician, Bengbu Municipal Construction Engineering Company
    I am a technician who often sees more than ten workers pulling stone rollers or wooden tampers to tamp ground troughs on construction sites. Using such outdated tools is not only labor-intensive and inefficient, but also prone to personal injury. Seeing this situation, I was determined to create a new tool to replace it. In the spring of 1952, based on the principle of the pile driver, I designed a "rammer." This rammer only requires one or two people to operate, and it can move forward by relying on the rotation of gears, while simultaneously tamping the ground troughs up and down. This can greatly save manpower and improve working conditions.
    I once solemnly submitted this suggestion to the company leadership. However, four years later, the rammer has not yet been produced. What is the reason for this? First, the leadership did not pay attention to my suggestion and did not fully support me. Second, over the years, with the support and encouragement of many workers, I have created and improved seven tools, including stone washing machines, sand screening machines, cement paving machines, and asphalt felt paving machines. Their working efficiency is one and a half to three times higher than that of old tools. After appraisal by the Anhui Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau, it was decided to promote five of them in the province's construction departments. Later, they were also exhibited in Bengbu and were welcomed by the construction departments. But unfortunately, these new tools are not used by our company, and they are locked in the "detention room" to rust. I felt really heartbroken when I saw this, and I thought: Don't make the rammer! Even if it takes a lot of effort to make it, it will suffer the same fate. In the spring of 1954, most of the parts were made, but seeing this situation, I put the rammer manufacturing work on hold.
    Recently, I attended the Bengbu Municipal Socialist Construction Activists Congress and was greatly encouraged by the report of the responsible comrade of the Municipal Party Committee, which aroused my idea of making a rammer again. The originally designed rammer could only go straight, and manual movement was required when turning. I now plan to further modify the original drawing so that it can turn automatically, and I plan to install a motor to replace manual operation. I request the company leadership to pay attention to my suggestion, find ways to support me, and transfer two workers to assist me, so that a scientific rammer can be manufactured successfully as soon as possible.

### 应该支持我试制打夯机

    应该支持我试制打夯机
    蚌埠市建筑工程公司技术员　施戒五
    我是一个技术员，时常在工地上看到十多个工人用绳子牵引着石硪或木夯在夯地槽。用这种落后的工具，不但劳动强度高，工作效率低，而且容易发生人身事故。看到这种情形，我就决心创造一种新工具来代替它。1952年春天，我依据打桩机的原理，设计出一部“打夯机”。这种打夯机只需要一个到两个人操作，它可以依靠齿轮的转动而向前移动，同时一上一下地夯地槽。这就可以大大节省人力，改善劳动条件。
    我曾经郑重地把这个建议提给公司领导方面。但是四年后的今天，打夯机还没有问世。这究竟是什么缘故呢？第一是领导方面不重视我的建议，没有充分支持我。第二是几年来，我在许多工人的支持和鼓励下，曾经先后创造和改进了淘石子机、筛砂机、水泥铺地器、铺油毛毡器等七种工具。它们的工作效率都比旧工具提高一倍半到三倍以上。安徽省建筑工程局鉴定以后，决定将其中的五种在全省建筑部门加以推广。后来，在蚌埠也曾展览过，受到建筑部门的欢迎。但是不幸得很，这些新工具本公司却不用，它们被关在“禁闭室”里锈坏了。我看了真痛心极了，心里想：打夯机也别做了吧！即使花费了很大精力把它做出来，也要遭到同样的命运。1954年春天，大部分零件都做好了，由于看到这种情况，我便把打夯机的制造工作搁置下来了。
    最近，我出席了蚌埠市社会主义建设积极分子大会，听了市委负责同志的报告，受到了很大的鼓舞，又引起了我做打夯机的念头。原来设计的打夯机只能直走，转弯的时候需要用人工移动。我现在计划进一步修改原图样，使它能够自动转弯，并且计划安装马达，代替人工操作。我请求公司领导方面重视我的建议，设法支持我，调两个工人协助我，以便把一部科学的打夯机早日制造成功。
