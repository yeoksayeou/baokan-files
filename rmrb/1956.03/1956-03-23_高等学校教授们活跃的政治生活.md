    Active Political Life of University Professors
    In the auditorium of Tsinghua University, on the 21st, more than 700 teachers were intently listening to the first Party lesson - how to strive to be a Communist Party member. Many elderly professors with already gray hair, along with young teaching assistants, participated in such a study meeting.
    Many senior professors at Beijing Normal University and other universities are actively studying the Party Constitution, the Party Program, and books on the cultivation of Party members. They strictly demand of themselves and earnestly do their work well. Wang Kunren, the head of the Biology Department of Beijing Normal University, specifically arranges further study time for young teachers and patiently helps them. Teachers care about each other's progress in political thought. Zhang Ren, the head of the Hydraulic Engineering Department of Tsinghua University, and Zhang Guangdou, the head of the Hydraulic Structure Teaching and Research Group, knowing that lecturer Ding Zeyi had a desire to join the Party, encouraged him with their own determination and confidence in actively striving to join the Party. Now, Ding Zeyi has also formally applied to join the Party. Many teachers at Beijing Agricultural University and other universities are invited to attend Party branch meetings as observers. They sincerely offer opinions and requests to the Party at the meetings.
    The progress of teachers' political thought has made their lives particularly fulfilling and open. Guo Yicen, an old professor of the Psychology Teaching and Research Group of Beijing Normal University, recently participated in a conference on joining the Party held by the student Communist Youth League branch. He happily spoke of his determination to join the Party at the meeting. Professor Zhao Fangxiong, the head of the Mathematics Teaching and Research Group of Tsinghua University, said: The distance between us and the Party should be expressed in mathematical language - reduced to zero.
    Currently, in Beijing's universities, more than 200 associate professors and above have applied to join the Party, and there are 350 lecturers. (Xinhua News Agency)

    高等学校教授们活跃的政治生活
    在清华大学的礼堂里，二十一日有七百多个教师在专心地静听第一讲党课——怎样争取做一个共产党员。很多头发已经花白的老教授，和年轻的助教一起参加了这样的学习会。
    北京师范大学等校很多老教授都在积极地学习党章、党纲和党员修养等书籍。他们都严格地要求自己，认真地做好工作。北京师范大学生物系主任汪坤仁具体地为年轻教师安排进修时间，耐心地帮助他们。教师们彼此关心政治思想的进步。清华大学水利工程系主任张任和水工结构教研组主任张光斗知道讲师丁则裕有入党要求，就用自己积极争取入党的决心和信心鼓励他，现在丁则裕也已正式申请入党，北京农业大学等校的很多教师被邀请列席党的支部大会。他们在会上诚恳地向党提出意见和要求。
    教师们政治思想的进步，使生活也特别充实和开朗。北京师范大学心理学教研组老教授郭一岑最近参加了学生青年团支部召开的漫谈入党问题的大会，他在会上高兴地谈了自己入党的决心。清华大学数学教研组主任赵访熊教授说：我们和党的距离应该用数学的语言来说——化为零。
    现在，北京全市高等学校副教授以上申请入党的有二百多人，讲师有三百五十人。　（新华社）
