The situation of Communist and Workers' Parties of Various Countries Conveying the Spirit of the CPSU Congress

    Korean Workers' Party Central Committee
    The Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party held a plenary session on the 20th. Choi Yong-kun, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party, delivered a report at the meeting on the delegation of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party's participation in the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and discussions were held at the meeting. Kim Il-sung, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party, made an important speech at the meeting.
    The meeting adopted a decision on the study of the documents of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union by party organizations and members at all levels of the Korean Workers' Party, and on further strengthening and developing the party's cause.

    French Communist Party Central Committee
    The Central Committee of the French Communist Party held a plenary session on March 22nd. Duclos delivered a report at the meeting entitled "Current Political Issues as Seen from the Summary of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union."
    After discussing Duclos's report, the meeting passed a resolution. The resolution pointed out that the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union are of extraordinarily great significance to the communist parties of all countries, the international workers' movement, and the people of all countries in the world. The plenary session emphasized that the argument adopted by the Congress on implementing leadership within the party according to Lenin's principles is of great significance to the communist parties of all countries.
    The resolution particularly emphasized the argument regarding the current possibility of avoiding war. The resolution said that this argument is of great significance to the development of the struggle to strengthen peace, and the plenary session refuted the opportunists' view that the premise for peaceful coexistence among countries must be the abandonment of the struggle to win the interests of the working class, to win socialism, and to win peace. The resolution said that if all the peace forces in the world do not step up their activities, it will be impossible to avoid war and consolidate peace.
    The plenary session pointed out that the French people's struggle for peace has already brought about certain positive results, and the French communists are now paying particular attention to the seriousness of the situation in Algeria.
    When the plenary session talked about the path of various countries to socialism, it emphasized that it is impossible to transition to socialism through parliament without constantly and actively engaging in activities to defend democratic freedoms.
    The resolution said, "The French communists cannot underestimate the efforts of the bourgeoisie to block this path. In the past, when the communists participated in the government, the bourgeoisie obstructed the assignment of certain ministerial positions to them; in 1947, the bourgeoisie squeezed the communists out of the government; after the elections on January 2 (1956 - editor), it obstructed the establishment of a solid alliance between the Communist Party and other left-wing parties; it is now proposing to restore the electoral system in small districts, attempting to reduce the number of seats in parliament for the working-class parties. From this, it can be seen that the transition to socialism through parliamentary means is not equal to a fantastical transition without struggle and without the leadership of the communist vanguard of the working class over the working class; the two cannot be confused."
    The plenary session paid particular attention to the necessity of unified action by the French working class. It emphasized that the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU encourage all communist party members to struggle to overcome the various obstacles that still hinder unified action, "France needs a united front of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party in order to implement, maintain, and develop policies that conform to the will and wishes expressed by the majority of the French people on January 2."
    The resolution then pointed out that the Communist Party's parliamentary group's vote in favor of the Mollet government on the Algerian issue has created favorable conditions for expanding the united front and for moving towards the establishment of a new people's front in order to prevent the restoration of the reactionaries. The plenary session called on all French communist party members to use these favorable conditions to expand their contacts with socialists in order to seek a negotiated solution to the Algerian issue.
    The final part of the resolution pointed out that French communist party members will be able to learn many useful things from the documents of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, and the plenary session resolution called on French communist party members to study the documents of this congress in depth.
    The resolution pointed out: "The struggle of the 20th Congress of the CPSU against the cult of personality and against all acts that undermine the principles of collective leadership should also prompt us to strengthen the spirit of collective leadership in the Party Central Committee, provincial committees, branch committees, and every group, to conduct broad, free, and in-depth discussions on the issues on the agenda, and to encourage beneficial criticism of errors and shortcomings, but we must not confuse the freedom of criticism with the freedom of bourgeois ideas to erode the ranks of the Party and the working class."

    German Communist Party Central Committee
    The Central Committee of the German Communist Party held its 23rd plenary session in Düsseldorf on March 17th and 18th. Remann, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, delivered a report at the meeting on the 20th Congress of the CPSU and explained the current situation in West Germany and the tasks of the German Communist Party.
    After detailed discussions, the Central Committee of the German Communist Party decided to issue a statement explaining the German Communist Party's policy on restoring the unified action of the working class, working-class organizations, and their political parties, in order to struggle, together with all the forces of the people, against West German militarism and to strive for peace, democracy, national independence, and a good life.
    The Central Committee of the German Communist Party also issued a letter to party members, calling on them to strengthen their activities among the masses according to the principles stipulated in the Party Central Committee's statement, and to strive, together with the working class and all democrats, to protect the legal existence of the German Communist Party, and thus also to strive for the freedom of the people.

    各国共产党和工人党传达苏共代表大会的情况
    朝鲜劳动党中央委员会
    朝鲜劳动党中央委员会在二十日举行了全体会议。劳动党中央委员会副委员长崔庸健在会上作了关于朝鲜劳动党中央委员会代表团参加苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的报告，并且在会上进行了讨论。劳动党中央委员会委员长金日成在会上作了重要发言。
    会议通过了关于朝鲜劳动党各级党组织和党员学习苏联共产党第二十次代表大会文件、进一步加强和发展党的事业的有关决定。
    法国共产党中央委员会
    法国共产党中央委员会在三月二十二日举行了全体会议。杜克洛在会上作了“从苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的总结看当前的政治问题”的报告。
    会议在讨论了杜克洛的报告后通过一项决议。决议指出，苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的决议对各国共产党、国际工人运动和全世界各国人民有异常重大的意义。全体会议着重指出，大会所通过的关于党内按照列宁的原则实行领导的论点，对各国共产党具有重大的意义。
    决议特别着重指出关于现时避免战争可能性这一论点。决议说，这一论点对发展加强和平的斗争有重大的意义，全体会议驳斥机会主义者的这种看法：各国的和平共处的前提必须是放弃争取工人阶级的利益、争取社会主义和和平的斗争。决议说，如果不是全世界一切和平力量加紧活动，避免战争和巩固和平就不可能实现。
    全体会议指出，法国人民的和平斗争已经带来了一定的积极结果，法国共产党人现在特别注意阿尔及利亚的局势的严重性。
    全体会议谈到各国向社会主义过渡的途径这一问题的时候着重指出，如果不经常积极进行保卫民主自由的活动，就不可能通过议会过渡到社会主义。
    决议说，“法国共产党人不能低估资产阶级企图堵塞这条途径的努力。过去当共产党人参加政府的时候，资产阶级就阻挠把某些部长职位交给他们；1947年资产阶级把共产党人排挤出政府；在一月二日（1956年——编者）的选举以后，它阻挠了共产党和其他左翼政党之间建立巩固的同盟；它现在提出恢复小区的选举制，企图减少工人阶级政党在议会中的代表席位。由此可见，通过议会方式过渡到社会主义，并不等于没有斗争和没有工人阶级的共产主义先锋队对工人阶级的领导的空想的过渡，这两者是不能混淆起来的。”
    全体会议特别重视法国工人阶级统一行动的必要性。它强调指出，苏共第二十次代表大会的决议鼓励着全体共产党员为战胜现在还妨碍着统一行动的种种障碍而斗争，“法国需要一个共产党和社会党的统一阵线以便执行、维护和发展符合大多数法国人在一月二日所表示的意志和愿望的政策。”
    决议接着指出，共产党议会党团在阿尔及利亚问题上投票赞成摩勒政府，从而为扩大统一阵线、为向建立新的人民阵线前进以便阻止反动派复辟创造了有利的条件。全体会议号召法国全体共产党员利用这些有利的条件扩大同社会党人士的事务接触，以争取通过谈判解决阿尔及利亚问题。
    决议的最后一部分指出，法国共产党员将能从苏共第二十次代表大会的文件中学习到许多有益的东西，全体会议决议号召法国共产党员深入研究这次大会的文件。
    决议指出：“苏共第二十次代表大会反对个人崇拜、反对各种破坏集体领导原则的行为的斗争应该也促使我们在党中央委员会、省委员会、支部委员会以及每个小组内加强集体领导的精神，对日程上的问题广泛进行自由而深入的讨论，鼓励对错误和缺点进行有益的批评，但是不要把批评的自由同资产阶级思想侵蚀党和工人阶级的队伍的自由混淆起来。”
    德国共产党中央委员会
    德国共产党中央委员会三月十七日、十八日两天在杜塞尔多夫举行了第二十三次中央全会，德国共产党中央委员会第一书记雷曼在会上就苏共第二十次代表大会作了报告，并且说明了西德的现状和德国共产党的任务。
    经过详细讨论后，德国共产党中央委员会决定发表一项声明，说明德国共产党关于恢复工人阶级、工人阶级组织及其政党的统一行动的政策，以便和一切人民的力量一起，为反对西德军国主义、争取和平、民主、民族独立和美好生活而斗争。
    德国共产党中央委员会还发表了告党员书，号召他们根据党中央声明中规定的原则，加强他们在群众中的活动，并且争取工人阶级和一切民主人士，为保护德国共产党的合法存在，从而也就是争取人民的自由而努力。
