    Restaurants Now Available Near Construction Sites
    After the Wuhan City catering industry fully transitioned to joint public-private ownership, the business network was initially adjusted under the leadership of the City Catering Company. Now, restaurants and food shops have also begun to appear near some basic construction sites and places far from the urban area. In addition to the Mianyang Restaurant, Hanxiangju Deli, and Shiyun Chun Vegetable Restaurant already moved to Qingshan, and Yixin Chun Restaurant already moved to Hongshan, recently Qiwanshun Restaurant moved to Hanyang West Avenue, Ai Yating moved to the Hanyang bridgehead of the Jianghan Bridge, and Huangpi Heji and Yunzhen restaurants moved near the construction site of the Soviet Exhibition Hall. The employees of these shops consider it an honor to have the opportunity to serve the basic construction workers; the workers at various construction sites also feel it is convenient.
    Without affecting the normal supply in the urban area, appropriately moving some of the overly concentrated restaurants to places farther from the urban area and to basic construction sites to better serve the basic construction workers is a correct approach.

    工地旁边有了餐馆
    武汉市饮食业全行业公私合营以后，在市饮食公司的领导下，初步调整了商业网。现在，在某些基本建设工地和离市区较远的地方，也开始有了餐馆和饮食店。除了沔阳饭店、汉香居熟食店和时运春菜馆已经搬往青山，一心春餐馆已经搬往洪山以外，最近又有祁万顺餐馆搬到汉阳西大街，爱雅亭搬到江汉桥汉阳桥头，黄陂合记和云珍等餐馆搬到苏联展览馆工地附近。这些店的职工都把有机会为基本建设工人服务引为光荣；各工地工人也感到方便。
    在不影响市区正常供应的情况下，适当地把过分集中的饮食店迁一部分到离市区较远的地方和基本建设工地去，更好地为基本建设工人服务，这种做法是正确的。
