    Strive to Fulfill the Five-Year Plan Ahead of Schedule
    Harbin Electric Brush Factory Starts Construction
    The Harbin Electric Brush Factory, designed with Soviet assistance, started construction ahead of schedule on March 8th. The main factory buildings, auxiliary factory buildings, woodworking factory buildings, boiler rooms, and other major factory buildings, originally scheduled to begin construction on April 15th, have all commenced construction.
    Construction workers are working intensely in the icy and snowy conditions, braving the post-snow cold. 19 advanced producers and 3 advanced groups on the construction site have launched a socialist emulation campaign. The construction department has proposed to complete all civil engineering tasks 45 days ahead of the construction department's proposed plan of completing the factory construction in one and a half years.

    National Coal Mines' January and February Output
    Increases by 20% Compared to the Same Period Last Year
    National coal mines produced more than 40,000 tons of raw coal in excess of the state plan in February. The output of raw coal in January and February of this year increased by more than 20% compared to the same period last year. Several large mines, such as Kailuan, Fushun, Fuxin, and Huainan, have all overfulfilled their plans. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
    Cement Plants Affiliated with the Ministry of Heavy Industry
    Produce 30,000 Tons More Cement in February
    State-owned and joint state-private cement plants affiliated with the Ministry of Heavy Industry produced 30,929 tons of cement in excess of the state plan in February, an increase of 8.26% compared to the actual output in February of last year. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
    Kaiyuan Thermal Power Plant Begins Generating Electricity
    Yunnan Province's first automated thermal power plant, the Kaiyuan Power Plant, completed the first phase of its project three months ahead of schedule at the end of February and has begun generating electricity. (Our correspondent in Kunming)
    Intense Construction on the Qingshui to Jiayuguan Section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway
    Xinjiang Departments Prepare Sleepers and Coal for the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway
    Many projects on the Qingshui to Jiayuguan section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway have commenced construction successively in January and February. Thousands of railway workers are working intensely on the long Gobi Desert, braving the severe cold, to extend the railway to Yumen as soon as possible.
    Currently, the main structure of the Fenglechuan Bridge is under construction, striving for completion by the 20th. The foundation excavation and concrete pouring for the three key bridge projects near Jiayuguan—Hongshui River, Beida River, and Wenshu Gully—have already begun. Mechanical road construction teams and laborers are constructing the roadbed in sections.
    Since the commencement of construction, workers in various trades have continuously exceeded quotas. The efficiency of the Fenglechuan Bridge foundation excavation work has exceeded the quota by an average of 20%. The efficiency of the Hongshui River Bridge concrete pouring work exceeded the quota by 5% on the first day. Many construction sites have also launched a "no tool requisition month" campaign, using refurbished old materials and modified tools to save wealth for the country. (Our correspondent in Lanzhou)
    The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is actively preparing railway sleepers and coal for the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway. The spruce and red pine abundant in the Tianshan Mountains of Hami are excellent materials for making railway sleepers. The Autonomous Region's Forestry Department has coordinated with the Hami Forestry Management Station, Hami Logging Company, and other units to dispatch a group of technicians to the Hami forest area in mid-February to conduct key logging surveys. The Xinjiang Geological Bureau's exploration team has also recently departed to conduct a general survey of coalfields in Hami, Turpan, and Yili. (Our correspondent in Urumqi)
    Guangdong Province Conducts In-depth Inspections of Spring Plowing Preparation
    Guangdong Province has launched a major inspection of spring plowing preparation work. According to the findings of the inspection, Guangdong Province has achieved great success in preparatory work before the Spring Festival, but there are also many problems. For example, the development of preparatory work is uneven; some areas have overfulfilled the preparatory plan, while others have completed it very poorly; many agricultural cooperatives have not yet formulated this year's production plan; some have only an empty plan without action; and some have poor quality due to blindly pursuing quantity, and even have false reports and false reports. This is mainly the result of generalized leadership. Therefore, through inspection, the leading departments at all levels have further strengthened the specific leadership of the preparatory work. For example, after inspecting, the Jieyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China found that some places were promoting sparse and dry sowing, but due to a lack of technical guidance, 20% of the seeds sown did not germinate; some townships only completed 30% of their fertilizer accumulation work. After discovering these problems, the county party committee not only solved them on the spot, but also used telephones to convene a meeting of district party secretaries to criticize the generalized style of leadership, further deploy the preparatory work, and instruct cadres in districts and townships to immediately organize technicians and experienced old farmers to go deep into the fields to comprehensively inspect the preparation for cultivation and promptly help the masses solve various difficulties.

    Zhejiang and Xi'an Workers Participate in Competition
    A surge of socialist emulation has swept through 545 local state-owned factories and mines in Zhejiang Province. According to incomplete statistics on March 6, more than 68,000 workers participated in inter-factory and inter-trade competitions.
    In the upsurge of competition, workers have created many new records. After 56 grain processing factories across the province launched competitions, merely improving the rice yield has increased rice production for the country by 1,947,800 catties. In Lanxi County, 88 weaving workers from 4 cloth factories exchanged experiences, enabling the four factories to achieve a first-class product rate of 99.9%. (Our correspondent in Hangzhou)

    Nine construction engineering companies and 49 larger factories in the Xi'an area have already participated in socialist emulation. In the socialist emulation, the masses of workers have put forward many rationalization proposals. According to incomplete statistics, basic construction units put forward 653 rationalization proposals in February. Many workers have created new records and improved product quality in the competition. The general assembly team of the Xi'an Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing Factory assembled a maximum of 213 double-wheeled double-furrow plows per day in January, which increased to 243 in February. The product quality of the Northwest State-Owned Fourth Cotton Textile Factory improved significantly in February. The first-class cloth rate of plain cloth reached 98.73%, and the first-class cloth rate of twill reached 98.42%. (Our correspondent in Xi'an)
    More than 100,000 Double-Wheel Plows Transported to the Countryside
    According to statistics from the Agricultural Implements Department of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, as of mid-February, 146,000 double-wheel plows had been transferred to rural areas by supply and marketing cooperatives in 20 provinces and cities, including Shandong, Shanxi, Guangdong, Sichuan, Zhejiang, Guangxi, Yunnan, Jiangsu, Guizhou, Jilin, Liaoning, Hubei, Anhui, Henan, Shaanxi, and Heilongjiang.

    为提早完成五年计划而奋斗
    哈尔滨电刷厂开工兴建
    苏联帮助我国设计的哈尔滨电刷厂，已经提前在3月8日开工兴建。原来计划在4月15日开工的主厂房、辅助厂房、木工厂房、锅炉房等主要厂房，都已经开工。
    建筑工人们冒着雪后严寒在冰天雪地里紧张施工。工地上的19个先进生产者和3个先进小组发起了社会主义竞赛。施工部门提出，要在建设部门提出的一年半完成建厂计划的基础上，再提前45天完成全部土木建筑任务。（黑龙江日报编辑部）
    全国煤矿一、二月份
    比去年同期增产煤20％
    全国煤矿2月份比国家计划多生产4万多吨原煤。今年1、2月份的原煤产量比去年同期增长20％以上。开滦、抚顺、阜新、淮南等几个大矿都超额完成计划。（据新华社讯）
    重工业部所属水泥厂
    2月份多产3万吨水泥
    重工业部所属国营和公私合营水泥厂，2月份比国家计划多生产了30，929吨水泥，比去年2月份实际产量提高8.26％。（据新华社讯）
    开远火电站开始发电
    云南省第一座自动化火力发电站——开远发电站，提前3个月在2月底完成了第一期工程，并已开始发电。（本报驻昆明记者）
    兰新路清水到嘉峪关段紧张施工
    新疆各有关部门为兰新路准备枕木和用煤
    兰新铁路清水到嘉峪关之间的许多工程，已经在一、二月间相继开工。几千铁路职工为了提早把铁路修到玉门，冒着严寒在漫长的戈壁滩上紧张地劳动着。
    现在，丰乐川大桥主体工程的建设正在进行，争取在20日完工。接近嘉峪关的洪水河、北大河、文殊沟3个重点桥梁工程，已经开始挖桥基和灌注混凝土。机械筑路队和民工们，正在分段修建路基。
    开工以来，各个工种的职工不断突破定额。丰乐川大桥挖基工作效率平均超过定额20％。洪水河大桥灌注混凝土的工作效率，在第一天就超过定额5％。许多工地还展开“不领工具月”，用旧料翻新、改制工具等办法为国家节约财富。（本报驻兰州记者）
    新疆维吾尔自治区正在积极为兰新铁路准备铁路枕木和火车用煤。哈密天山一带盛产的云杉和红松，是做枕木的良好材料，自治区林业厅已经协同哈密林业管理站、哈密伐木公司等单位抽调一批技术人员，在2月中旬进入哈密林区进行重点采伐调查工作。新疆地质分局探勘队最近也出发到哈密、吐鲁番和伊犁等地普查煤田。（本报驻乌鲁木齐记者）
    广东省深入检查春耕准备工作
    广东省展开春耕准备工作的大检查。从检查出来的情况看，在春节以前，广东省各地备耕工作已获得很大的成绩，但存在的问题也不少。比如备耕工作发展不平衡，有的已经超额完成了备耕计划；有的完成的很差；不少的农业合作社还没有订出今年的生产计划；有的只有一个空计划，没有行动；有的由于盲目追求数量，质量很差，甚至有虚报成绩，做假报告等现象。这主要是一般化领导的结果。因此各级领导部门通过检查，都进一步加强了备耕工作的具体领导。比如中共揭阳县委会，通过检查发现有些地方在推行疏播旱播中，由于缺乏技术指导，播下的种籽有20％不出芽；有些乡积肥工作只完成计划30％。县委发现这些问题后，除就地进行解决外，并利用电话召开区委书记会议，批判了一般化的领导作风，进一步布置备耕工作，指示各区乡干部立即组织技术员和有经验的老农民深入田间，全面检查备耕工作情况，及时帮助群众解决各种困难。（本报驻广州记者）
    浙江西安职工参加竞赛
    浙江省545个地方国营厂矿企业掀起了社会主义竞赛热潮。据3月6日的不完全统计，参加厂际竞赛、同工种竞赛的职工有68，000多人。
    在竞赛热潮中，职工们创造了许多新纪录。全省56个粮食加工厂开展竞赛以后，仅提高出米率一项，就为国家增产大米1，947，800斤。兰溪县4个布厂88个挡车工人，互相交流经验，使4个厂的正品率达到了99.9％。
          （本报驻杭州记者）
    西安地区已经有9个建筑工程公司和49个较大的工厂参加了社会主义竞赛。在社会主义竞赛中，职工群众提出了很多合理化建议。据不完全的统计，基本建设单位在2月份就提出合理化建议653条。许多工人在竞赛中创造了新纪录，提高了产品质量。西安农业机械制造厂总装小组1月份每天最多装213部双轮双铧犁，2月份提高到243部。西北国营第四棉纺织厂2月份来产品质量显著提高。平布的正布率达到98.73％，斜布的正布率达到98.42％。（本报驻西安记者）
    十几万部双轮带铧犁运到农村
    据中华全国供销合作总社农具处统计，到2月中旬为止，已有146，000部双轮带铧犁由山东、山西、广东、四川、浙江、广西、云南、江苏、贵州、吉林、辽宁、湖北、安徽、河南、陕西、黑龙江等20个省市的供销合作社调运到农村。（据新华社讯）
