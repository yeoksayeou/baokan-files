In the socialist transformation of private industry, commerce, and handicrafts in Jingyang County, Shaanxi Province, a tendency toward blindly merging shops occurred. In Chengguan Town, the 62 restaurants and 57 food stalls were reorganized into just 12 supply points. Originally, there were people on the streets carrying baskets and shoulder poles selling steamed buns, fried dough sticks, and soy milk; now they have all become stationary vendors. People now have to pay and buy tickets before they can buy fried dough sticks and soy milk. Originally, there were shoe repairers in the east and west gates and the main street of the county seat, but now they are merged into one place, and people have to travel a long way to get a pair of shoes repaired. In Yunyang Town, because the original operating methods of small vendors were disrupted, people also have to queue up to buy tickets to buy *heluo* noodles, which the masses are not used to.

This practice of blindly merging small vendors and handicraft households reflects that these comrades have forgotten that the starting point for our Party in doing all work and handling all matters, large and small, is whether it is beneficial to the masses. Forgetting the convenience of the masses naturally leads to a path that violates the Party's policies.

    “于民不利”
    陕西省泾阳县在对私营工商业和手工业进行社会主义改造中，发生了盲目并店的偏向。城关镇共有62户饮食店和57户饮食摊贩，一下子就被改组成12个供应点。原来街上提篮子、挑担子卖包子和卖油条、豆浆的，也都成了座商。群众买油条、豆浆也得先交钱买票。原来，县城东、西关和正街都有上鞋的，现在合并在一个地方，群众要补一双鞋得跑许多路。在云阳镇，由于打乱了小商贩原来的经营方法，买餄餎也要先排队买票，群众很不习惯。
    这种盲目合并小商贩和手工业户的做法，反映这些同志忘记了我们党做一切工作、处理一切大小问题，都是以对群众是否有利作出发点的。忘记了群众的便利，自然就走上了违反党的政策的道路。
