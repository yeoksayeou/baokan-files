    Ministry of Commerce Holds National Conference of Provincial and Municipal Department Directors
    The fourth National Conference of Provincial and Municipal Department Directors of the Ministry of Commerce concluded on the 13th. Minister of Commerce, Zeng Shan, delivered a concluding report at the conference.
    Zeng Shan pointed out in his report: In addition to completing the procurement tasks according to plan, the most important task for commercial work in 1956 is to do a good job in commodity supply. The most important issue in supply work is how to improve the supply to rural areas.
    Zeng Shan said that in order to guarantee the completion of this year's state-owned commercial plan, four tasks must be done well: First, commercial institutions must be rapidly established in counties and important market towns below the county level, so that various commodities can meet the broad masses of people, and it will be convenient for rural supply and marketing cooperatives and small vendors to purchase goods nearby. Second, it is necessary to combine well with the supply and marketing cooperatives, and the commodity circulation plans of each other must be coordinated. All possible ways should be considered to help and promote the supply and marketing cooperatives and small vendors to purchase goods. Third, improve the allocation of commodities, and further eliminate unreasonable phenomena such as commodities not meeting the needs of the people, untimely supply, and roundabout transportation. Fourth, all commercial departments must constantly understand the needs of the people, especially the peasants. And organize commodity supply according to the needs of the people, and at the same time should guide people's consumption.
    Regarding doing a good job in the socialist transformation of urban private commerce, Zeng Shan pointed out that new specialized companies must be established rapidly, so that specialized institutions are responsible for leading all walks of life in society. He said that under the principle of both facilitating consumers' purchases and enabling small shops to maintain their livelihoods and maintain their enthusiasm for operation, state-owned commercial departments must make overall arrangements for small shops in large, medium, and small counties and cities, so that they can play an active role in the commodity circulation process in order to expand commodity circulation, facilitate purchases by urban and rural people, and ensure urban and rural supply.

    商业部召开全国各省市厅局长会议
    商业部第四届全国各省市厅局长会议13日结束，商业部部长曾山在会议上作了总结报告。
    曾山在报告中指出：1956年的商业工作，除了按计划完成收购任务以外，更重要的是做好商品供应工作。在供应工作中最主要的问题，是如何做好对农村的供应工作。
    曾山说，为了保证完成今年国营商业的计划，必须做好四件工作：一、迅速地把商业机构设置到县和县以下的重要集镇，以便使各种商品和广大群众见面，并且便利乡村供销合作社和小商小贩就近进货。二、要和供销合作社结合好，彼此的商品流通计划要衔接好，应该想一切办法帮助和推动供销合作社和小商小贩进货。三、改进商品的调拨工作，进一步消除商品不符合人民需要、供应不及时和迂回运输等不合理的现象。四、所有商业部门要经常不断地了解人民，特别是农民的需要。并且根据人民的需要来组织商品供应，同时应该指导人民消费。
    对于做好城市私营商业的社会主义改造工作，曾山指出，必须迅速成立新的专业公司，使社会上各行各业都有专门机构负责领导。他说，在既能便利消费者购买，又能使小商店维持生活、保持经营积极性的原则下，国营商业部门对大中小县城的小商店必须统筹安排，使他们能够在商品流通过程中发挥积极作用，以扩大商品流通，便利城乡人民购买，保证城乡供应。　（据新华社讯）
