The All-China Science and Technology Popularization Association has hired experts from various fields and responsible persons from relevant government departments to form a number of specialized academic groups. The main tasks of the specialized academic groups are to determine the publicity guidelines, main content, and topic selection for their respective scientific fields, based on the association's overall publicity policy; to organize academic group members to discuss and review lecture drafts and publication drafts; to study audience feedback; and to guide and assist local science popularization associations in conducting publicity work, in order to improve the quality and ideological level of scientific publicity work through collective work methods.

So far, 16 specialized academic groups have been established, including those for chemistry, textiles, forestry, water conservancy, agronomy, machinery, mining and metallurgy fuels, and medical prevention. Among the leaders of the academic groups are Zhang Hanying, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Water Conservancy; Chen Weiji, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Textile Industry; Li Lianjie and Shen Qizhen, members of the Biology and Earth Sciences Department of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Wang Zhizhi and Hou Xianglin, members of the Technical Sciences Department; and Professor Cai Xu, a famous agronomist, and others.

The National Science Popularization Association will also establish academic groups for physics, earth sciences, electricity, telecommunications, civil engineering, and construction this year. (Xinhua News Agency)
