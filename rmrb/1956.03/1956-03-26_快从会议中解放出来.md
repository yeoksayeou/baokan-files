Quickly Liberate Yourself from Meetings
　　Lü Jianzhong

Recently, Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang Province, was criticized by the Provincial Party Committee for its poor spring plowing preparation work. According to the inspection by the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee's working group in the countryside, the important reason for the lagging spring plowing preparation work in Zhaodong County was that the Zhaodong County Party Committee held a series of meetings from the Spring Festival to the beginning of March, and no one had gone to the countryside, resulting in a lack of leadership in the spring plowing preparation work.

Of course, some meetings urgently needed to be convened by the county party committee leaders, but some were not. Some of these meetings could be postponed, some could be merged with other meetings, and some could be convened by professional departments, without necessarily requiring the county party committee to personally lead them. However, the Zhaodong County Party Committee did not arrange the meetings this way, which not only made it impossible for the leading comrades of the county party committee to go down, but also added a heavy burden to the cadres of the districts, townships, and cooperatives. For example, the district chief of the Seventh District has not returned to the district since attending the county cooperative representative meeting.

During this period, batches of village, cooperative, and backbone cadres were drawn to the county leading organs for meetings, which made the leadership work of the cooperatives very unsound, so that the production of some cooperatives fell into a state of drift. The county cooperative representative meeting arranged well-drilling tasks, but due to a lack of specific leadership, insufficient material preparation, and some technical problems that could not be solved, the well-drilling work in most areas did not start. Filling sand and replacing soil to transform alkaline land is a decisive measure in the county's increase production plan, but this work has not been carried out. The planned fertilization area in the county reaches 80%, but now it is less than 50%. The National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) has become a powerful weapon for promoting production and consolidating cooperatives in many areas, but in Zhaodong County, many people have not even heard of it. Many cadres and masses in the county lack confidence in completing this year's production increase tasks. The production targets in some areas are too high, and cadres dare not propose to revise them. In addition, phenomena such as chaotic cooperative accounts, large numbers of livestock deaths, disunity among cooperative backbones, and members arguing over grabbing work are also quite common.

What is worse is that these serious situations have not attracted enough attention from the Zhaodong County Party Committee. The increasingly urgent spring plowing production requires the Zhaodong County Party Committee to quickly liberate itself and many county, district, and grassroots cadres from countless meetings, and effectively do a good job in various preparations for spring plowing production.

    快从会议中解放出来
    吕建中
    最近，黑龙江省肇东县因春耕准备工作不好受到了省委的批评。根据中共黑龙江省委下乡工作组的检查，肇东县春耕准备工作落后的重要原因，是肇东县委从春节到三月上旬召开了一连串的会议，没有一个人下过乡，以致春耕准备工作缺乏领导。
    当然有些会议是急需要由县委领导召开的，但是有些也并不是这样。这些会议有的可以推迟，有的可以和别的会议合并，有的可以由专业部门召开，不一定都要县委亲自领导。但是肇东县委并没有这样来安排会议，这就不仅使县委会的领导同志抽不开身下去，而且给区、乡、社的干部增加了沉重的负担。比如第七区的区长从到县开合作社代表会议开始，就一直没有回过区。
    在这个期间，村、社干部和骨干分子一批接一批抽到县领导机关开会，使得合作社的领导工作很不健全，以致有些社的生产陷于自流状态。县合作社代表会议上布置了打井任务，但是由于缺乏具体领导，物资准备不足，有些技术问题也得不到解决，大部分地区的打井工作没有动手。填沙换土、改造碱地，是全县增产措施中的具有决定意义的一项，可是这项工作一直没有开展起来。全县计划施肥面积达80％，现在连50％还不到。全国农业发展纲要（草案）在许多地区已经成为推动生产和巩固合作社的有力武器，但是在肇东县，很多群众连听说还没有听说。全县不少干部和群众对完成今年的增产任务缺乏信心，有些地区的生产指标偏高，干部也不敢提出来加以修订。此外像合作社账目混乱，牲畜大批死亡，社内骨干互不团结，社员为抢活干吵架等现象也是相当普遍的。
    糟糕的是：这些严重情况并没有引起肇东县委的足够重视。日益迫切的春耕生产要求肇东县委迅速把自己和许多县、区干部以及基层干部从数不尽的会议中解放出来，切实地把春耕生产的各项准备工作做好。
