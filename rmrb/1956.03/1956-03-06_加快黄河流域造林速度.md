To accelerate afforestation in the Yellow River Basin

Liu Jiasheng, Engineer of Afforestation Bureau, Ministry of Forestry

The forest area in the Yellow River Basin accounts for only 1.8% of the entire basin area, which has led to serious soil erosion for a long time. Water and drought disasters occur year after year, bringing endless suffering to the people. Now, the long-awaited task of fundamentally harnessing the Yellow River is about to begin. The task of controlling the Yellow River flood requires extensive soil and water conservation work on the Loess Plateau. Afforestation is the most economical and effective way to conserve water and soil. The National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) for 1956-1967 stipulates that, starting this year, all barren mountains and wastelands that can be afforested nationwide should be greened within 12 years. Therefore, accelerating the speed of afforestation in the Yellow River Basin and greening the Loess Plateau as soon as possible is not only of great significance for controlling the Yellow River, but also urgently needed for further development of agricultural production.

At present, all provinces in the Yellow River Basin have basically achieved semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization. This new situation provides extremely favorable conditions for accelerating the greening of the Yellow River Basin. When thousands of farmers know that afforestation will bring them a happy life, they will enthusiastically make great efforts for the greening cause and create amazing miracles. The 40-li long bank protection forest on both sides of the Yellow River in Helan County, Gansu Province, was originally planned to be completed in three years; however, after cooperativization, millions of farmers completed it in one day.

Farmers in the Yellow River Basin have accumulated rich experience in their struggle against nature for many years. In the past, Tianjiazhuang in Tianshui City, Dengjiabao in Wushan County, Gansu Province, Daquanshan in Yanggao County, Shanxi Province, and Dujiashigou in Mizhi County, Shaanxi Province, were all places where "crops did not grow in drought, and floods caused disasters in rain." After liberation, the Party organizations and governments in these areas led the masses to plant trees and afforest, and carried out field projects and gully management, which basically stopped the serious soil erosion. The barren mountains and bare ridges of the past have become lush green and full of flowers and fruits, and agricultural production and farmers' lives have improved significantly. The experiences of these areas prove that as long as we resolutely rely on the masses, give full play to the farmers' production enthusiasm, and actively promote the rich experiences of the masses, we will be able to accelerate the speed of afforestation in the Yellow River Basin and green the Loess Plateau as soon as possible.

The preliminary outline of afforestation in the Yellow River Basin is: within 7 to 12 years, 12,208,900 hectares of forest will be planted and 8,880,700 hectares of mountain will be closed for afforestation on the Loess Plateau. This shows how huge the scale of our afforestation project is.

According to the topographic structure and soil erosion characteristics, the areas with severe soil erosion in the Yellow River are roughly divided into four types. According to this distinction, different requirements should be put forward for the forest coverage rate (that is, the percentage of forest to the total land area): (1) Hilly gully area: The area is about 232,440 square kilometers, with the most serious soil erosion. The amount of sediment washed away per square kilometer per year is 5,000-10,000 metric tons. In northern Shaanxi and western Shanxi, where soil erosion is the most serious, the forest coverage rate should reach about 40%; the forest coverage rate in the upper reaches of the Yan River, Jing River, North Luo River, Wuding River, and northeastern Gansu, Shanxi River, and Zuli River Basin should reach about 30%; the forest coverage rate in the Wei River and Fen River Basin, southern Shanxi, western Henan, and Yi Luo River Basin should reach about 28%. (2) Plateau gully area: The area is 26,900 square kilometers, and the amount of sediment washed away per square kilometer per year is 4,000-9,000 metric tons. The forest coverage rate in this area should reach about 28%. (3) Rocky mountain area: Including the mountainous area in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, which also includes residual forest areas with slight soil erosion. The area is 85,400 square kilometers, and the amount of sediment washed away per square kilometer per year is 1,000-5,000 metric tons. This area has many barren mountains and wastelands, and less arable land. The forest coverage rate should reach more than 40%. (4) Sandy area: Including the sandy area on the edge of the Ikezhao League in the northern part of the Yellow River Basin in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The area is 28,410 square kilometers. Although the amount of sediment flowing into the Yellow River every year is relatively small, the wind and sand disasters are serious. The forest coverage rate should reach about 40%.

The fundamental issue of soil and water conservation in the Loess Plateau is the transformation and utilization of gullies. Therefore, the main purpose of afforestation in the Yellow River Basin is to use forests to consolidate gullies, protect slopes, and protect "ridges and mounds." In order to achieve this requirement, it is necessary to build slope protection forests, gully bottom anti-erosion forests, gully head protection forests, water source regulation forests, terraced field protection forests, reservoir protection forests and bank protection forests, windbreak and sand-fixation forests, and farmland protection forests in the Loess Plateau.

In addition to adopting measures such as mixed planting of trees and shrubs and dense planting, when building soil and water conservation forests, priority should be given to selecting tree species with fast growth, early benefits, and great water storage and soil conservation effects; at the same time, the quality of tree species should be taken into account to meet the needs of the country and the masses for timber. Therefore, in the Yellow River Basin, tree species such as black locust, elm, apricot, walnut, oil pine, poplar, willow, oak, locust, mulberry, persimmon, jujube, apple, and pear can be planted, as well as shrubs such as tamarisk, Caragana korshinskii, Ziziphus spinosa, Lespedeza bicolor, Amorpha fruticosa, and sand willow (this is the main sand-fixing shrub suitable for sandy areas).

It must be noted that the factors of soil erosion are complex. Forestry measures must be carried out under the guidance of a unified plan for agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and animal husbandry, in order to exert the comprehensive soil and water conservation effect of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and water conservancy, more effectively reduce water and drought disasters, and ensure the increase in agricultural production and the safety of water conservancy and industrial construction.

The great development of the afforestation cause requires a sufficient supply of seedlings. In the past, the survey of mother trees in various provinces in the Yellow River Basin was very rough. In order to adapt to the speed of afforestation development, all localities must seize the investigation and observation of mother trees, find out the source of seeds, master the law of tree fruiting (such as bumper years, maturity period), and organize tree planting work in a planned way. Only in this way can the supply of excellent seeds be guaranteed.

Seedling cultivation must also be greatly strengthened. In addition to state-owned nurseries improving their operation and management, giving full play to existing production potential, and increasing the number of seedlings cultivated, agricultural production cooperatives are also required to establish nurseries to cultivate seedlings.

Before afforestation, a detailed investigation should be conducted on local specific conditions (including soil, climate, topography, forest type, tree species, seedling supply, etc.), and a careful calculation should be made of the manpower and material resources required for each process, and a practical design plan should be formulated as the basis for the construction and afforestation project. In particular, during the two years of 1956-1957, we must do a good job in investigation and design to lay a favorable foundation for large-scale afforestation in the future.

Since the climate in the Loess Plateau is dry and there is insufficient moisture, in order to green the barren mountains, in some places, soil improvement work should be carried out first, using methods such as planting pasture, cultivating shrubs, or digging horizontal ditches and large pits on the slopes to store water and conserve soil, so as to create good conditions for afforestation and seedling growth.

In order to improve the survival rate of afforestation, we must afforest in accordance with the correct work procedures. Investigation and design, seed collection and seedling cultivation, land preparation, planting, and tending are indispensable work procedures in the general afforestation process. However, in recent years, many areas have not completely followed the procedures. Some afforestation does not prepare the land; some afforestation does not tend; some afforestation blindly without investigation and design; and some violate the technical operation requirements of seed collection, seedling cultivation, and planting, so the survival rate and preservation rate of afforestation are very low, resulting in the phenomenon of "afforestation without seeing forests." In the future, afforestation must ensure both quantity and quality. Therefore, special attention should be paid to land preparation before afforestation and soil loosening and weeding after afforestation. In a certain period after afforestation, the survival rate should also be checked, necessary replanting should be carried out according to the survival of young forests, and the protection of young forests should be strengthened.

    加快黄河流域造林速度
    林业部造林局工程师  刘家声
    黄河流域的森林面积仅占整个流域面积的1.8％，长期以来形成了严重的水土流失，水旱灾害连年不断，给人民带来了无穷的灾难。现在，全国人民瞩望的根治黄河工作就要开始了。根治黄河水害的任务，要求在黄土高原广泛地开展水土保持工作。造林就是保水保土的最经济、最有效的一个办法。1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）规定，从今年起，12年内绿化全国一切可以绿化的荒山荒地。因此加快黄河流域的造林速度，尽快地绿化黄土高原，不但对于治理黄河有重要意义，而且也为进一步发展农业生产所迫切需要。
    现在，黄河流域各省，已经基本上实现了半社会主义的农业合作化，这一新的形势为加速黄河流域的绿化提供了极其有利的条件。当千千万万农民知道造林将给他们带来幸福的生活的时候，他们就会踊跃地为绿化事业作出伟大的努力，创造出惊人的奇迹。甘肃省贺兰县黄河两岸40里长的护岸林，原计划在三年完成；但是在合作化以后，千百万的农民用一天的时间就完成了。
    黄河流域的农民多年来在同自然作斗争中，积累了丰富的经验。甘肃省天水市田家庄、武山县邓家堡、山西省阳高县大泉山、陕西省米脂县杜家石沟，过去都是“天旱庄稼不长，雨涝又要成灾”的地方，解放后，这些地区的党的组织和政府领导群众植树造林，再加进行了田间工程和沟壑治理工作，结果就基本上制止了水土的严重流失。过去的荒山秃岭已经成为绿树葱笼、花果满山的地方，农业生产和农民生活显著提高。这些地区的经验证明，只要坚决依靠群众，发挥农民的生产热情，积极推广群众中的丰富经验，就一定能够加快黄河流域造林的速度，使黄土高原早日绿化。
    黄河流域造林的初步轮廓是：在7年到12年的时间内，在黄土高原造林12，208，900公顷，封山育林8，880，700公顷。这说明我们的造林工程的规模是多么巨大。
    黄河水土流失严重地区，根据地形构造和土壤侵蚀性质，大体上分为4种地区。按照这个区分，就要对于森林复被率（即森林占土地总面积的百分比）提出不同的要求：（一）丘陵沟壑区：面积约为232，440平方公里，水土流失最严重，每平方公里每年泥沙冲刷量为5，000—10，000公吨。在水土流失最严重的陕北、晋西，森林复被率应该达到40％左右；延水、泾河、北洛河、无定河上游及甘肃东北部、山水河、祖厉河流域，森林复被率应该达到30％左右；渭河和汾河流域、晋南、豫西及伊洛河流域，森林复被率应该达到28％左右。（二）高原沟壑区：面积26，900平方公里，每平方公里每年泥沙冲刷量为4，000—9，000公吨。这个地区的森林复被率应该达到28％左右。（三）土石山区：包括黄河中游的山区，其中还有水土流失轻微的残林区，面积85，400平方公里，每平方公里每年泥沙冲刷量为1，000—5，000公吨。这个地区荒山荒地多，可开垦的农田较少，森林复被率应该达到40％以上。（四）风沙区：包括黄河流域北部的内蒙古自治区，伊克昭盟边缘一带的风沙区，面积为28，410平方公里，每年流入黄河的泥沙虽然较少，但是风沙灾害严重，森林复被率应该达到40％左右。
    黄土区水土保持的根本问题，是对于沟壑的改造和利用，因此在黄河流域造林的主要目的是利用森林去固沟、护坡、保“梁峁”。为了实现这个要求，必须在黄土区分别营造护坡林、沟底防冲林、沟头防护林、水源调节林、梯田和阶地防护林、水库防护林和护岸林、防风固沙林、护田林。
    营造水土保持林除应该采取乔灌木混交、密植的措施外，在树种上首先应该选择生长快、收益早、蓄水保土作用大的树种；同时要兼顾到树种的材质，以便满足国家和群众用材的需要。因此，在黄河流域，可以栽植洋槐、榆、杏、胡桃、油松、杨、柳、橡、栎、桑、柿、枣、苹果、梨等乔木和柽柳、柠条、酸刺、狼牙刺、胡枝子、紫穗槐、沙柳（这是适于风沙区的主要固沙灌木）等灌木。
    必须注意，水土流失的因素是复杂的，林业方面的措施必须在农业、林业、水利和畜牧的统一规划的指导下进行，以便发挥农、林、牧、水利综合性的水土保持作用，更有效地减免水旱等灾害，保证农业的增产和水利、工业建设的安全。
    造林事业的大发展，要求种苗的充分供应。过去，黄河流域各省的母树调查工作做得很粗糙。为了适应造林发展的速度，各地要抓紧进行母树的调查、观测，摸清种源，掌握树木结实的规律（如丰歉年，成熟期），有计划地组织种树工作。这样才能保证优良种子的供应。
    育苗工作也必须大大加强。除国营苗圃要改善经营管理，发挥现有生产潜力，增加育苗数量外，还要求农业生产合作社建立苗圃，培育树苗。
    造林之前，要对当地具体条件（包括土壤、气候、地形、林种、树种、种苗供应等）进行细致的调查，并且对每一个工序所需用的人力、物力进行周密的计算，定出切实可行的设计方案，作为施工造林工程的依据。特别是1956—1957两年中，一定要做好调查设计工作，为今后大规模造林奠定有利的基础。
    由于黄土高原地区气候干旱，水分不足，要绿化荒山，有些地方，应该先进行土壤改良工作，利用种植牧草、栽培灌木，或者在山坡上先挖水平沟、挖大坑蓄水保土等办法，给造林和幼苗的生长创造良好条件。
    为了提高造林的成活率，一定要按照正确的工作程序造林。调查设计、采种育苗、整地、栽植、抚育，这是一般造林过程中不可缺少的工作程序。但是几年来，许多地区没有完全按照工序办事，有的造林不整地；有的造林不抚育；有的不经过调查设计，盲目造林，有的违反采种、育苗和栽植等技术操作要求，所以造林成活率和保存率很低，造成“造林不见林”的现象。今后，造林既要保证数量又要保证质量。因此特别要注意造林前的整地和造林后松土除草工作。在造林后的一定时期，还要检查成活率，按照幼林的成活情况，进行必要的补植，同时加强对幼林的保护。
