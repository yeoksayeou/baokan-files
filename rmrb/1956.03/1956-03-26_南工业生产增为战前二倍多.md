Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: According to a report by the Yugoslav News Agency, Yugoslavia's current industrial production has reached 242% of its pre-war level. This statement was made by the Secretary-General of the Yugoslav Industrial Association, Moric, at a meeting in Zagreb on March 22nd.

Moric pointed out that industry currently accounts for 42% of Yugoslavia's total national income, compared to only 19% before the war.

Moric also said that the growth of Yugoslavia's industrial production is mainly due to the commissioning of new factories and improved supply of raw materials. Industrial labor productivity has not increased accordingly, and labor productivity has remained almost at the same level for the past four years.

    南工业生产增为战前二倍多
    新华社23日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社报道：南斯拉夫目前的工业生产已经达到了战前水平的242％。这番话是南斯拉夫工业联合会秘书长莫里奇三月二十二日在萨格勒布的一次会议上说的。
    莫里奇指出，南斯拉夫工业目前在整个国民收入中所占的比重已经达到42％，而战前只占19％。
    莫里奇还说，南斯拉夫工业生产的增长主要是由于新工厂投入生产和原料供应情况改善而取得的。工业劳动生产率没有得到相应的提高，过去四年劳动生产率几乎处于同一水平。
