Farmers in Shidong Township, Neijiang County, Sichuan Province, have used their surplus labor to transform more than 750 mu of thin and poor land into thick and fertile land. It is estimated that the improved land will increase grain production by more than 100,000 jin this year. Under the slogan of "transforming bad fields into good fields, and turning barren mountains into cultivated land," farmers have been working hard for the past two months, day and night, rain or shine, with hundreds of them carrying river sand and fertile mud to the thin soil. Many bad lands that were once known as "a knife in sunny weather, a bag of mess in rainy weather" have now become fertile fields. (Shen Jie)

    史东乡农民努力改良土壤
    四川省内江县史东乡农民利用剩余劳动力改变了750多亩薄田薄土为厚田厚土，据估计经过改良的土地今年约可增产粮食十多万斤。农民在改坏田为好田、变荒山为熟地的行动口号下，近两个月来，不分白天、黑夜、天晴、落雨，都有几百个农民把河沙、肥泥挑到瘦薄的土中。许多过去被人称为天晴一把刀，落雨一包糟的坏土地，现在都变成了良田。（沈杰）
