Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 13th: French Foreign Minister Christian Pineau delivered a radio address on All India Radio on the evening of March 12th.

    In his speech, Pineau explained the French government's recently adopted attitude towards some issues of international policy that he announced. Pineau said, "France is not trying to abandon its traditional friendships or betray its allies, but in our world, things happen very quickly, and political leaders certainly have a responsibility to adjust their methods when necessary."

    Pineau believes that peace cannot be achieved solely through political or military security. Pineau said that in recent years, and perhaps especially in the past few weeks, international relations have begun to ease, and there has been the beginning of the possibility of building trust. "We must seize the few opportunities we in France may have in this regard," and France must "strive to be at the forefront of the struggle for world peacebuilding."

    Pineau said that it is for this reason that the current French government has repeatedly emphasized in the past few weeks that new efforts must be made, and if universal disarmament cannot be achieved immediately, at least arms reduction must begin, whether in conventional or nuclear armaments. Pineau stated that France will present a new disarmament plan at the upcoming United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee, which will consider the proposals already put forward by Eisenhower and Bulganin while proposing new steps towards disarmament.

    Pineau said that we have followed the proceedings of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union with great interest. Pineau said, "It is completely futile to endlessly discuss whether the statements (of the Congress) are sincere or not," "We must move forward on the basis of what has already been said. We intend to deal with all issues arising between Western countries and the Soviet Union in the future with a sincere hope and genuine desire for a peaceful solution."

    When talking about the French government's policy on North Africa, Pineau said that France allowed Morocco to gain independence and is about to resolve the Tunisian issue. Pineau said that in Algeria, a solution must be sought that allows Algerians of Muslim descent and people of European descent to live together peacefully, and France hopes to freely discuss this solution with relevant parties. Pineau said, "The colonial era is over, and a new type of cooperation between peoples can only be established on the basis of equal rights and responsibilities."

    比诺在印度发表广播演说
    据新华社新德里13日电　法国外交部长比诺12日晚在全印广播电台发表演说。
    比诺在演说中解释了他所宣布的关于法国政府最近对于国际政策一些问题所采取的态度的问题。比诺说：“法国并不是要设法背弃它的传统的友谊关系或者对它的盟友背信，但是在我们这个世界上，事情的发生非常迅速，政治领袖们当然有责任在某些必要的情况下调整他们的方法。”
    比诺认为，不能单靠政治上或军事上保障安全就可以获得和平。比诺说，最近几年以来，也许是特别过去几个星期间，国际关系开始有了缓和，已经有了可能建立信任的开端。“我们必须抓住我们在法国可能有的这方面的不多的机会”，法国要“努力站在争取世界和平建设的斗争的最前列”。
    比诺说，就是由于这个原因，现在执政的法国政府过去几个星期不断强调必须进行新的努力，如果不能立即达成普遍裁军，无论如何也必需开始裁减军备，不论是常规军备还是核子军备。比诺表示，法国要在即将举行的联合国裁军小组委员会上提出新的裁军计划，这种计划在提出走向裁军的新步骤的同时，也将考虑艾森豪威尔和布尔加宁已经提出的建议。
    比诺说，我们怀着很大的兴趣密切地注意了苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的进行情况。比诺说，“无休止地讨论（大会）这些发言是不是真心诚意是完全徒劳无益的”，“我们必须在这些发言已有的基础上前进。我们今后就打算这样来怀着争取和平解决的衷心希望和真诚愿望处理西方国家和苏联之间产生的一切问题”。
    比诺在谈到法国政府在北非问题上的政策时说，法国让摩洛哥获得了独立，并且就要解决突尼斯问题。比诺说，在阿尔及利亚，必须寻求能使回教血统的阿尔及利亚人和欧洲血统的人和平相处的解决办法，法国希望同有关方面自由地讨论这种解决办法。比诺说，“殖民时代已经过去，只有在权利和责任平等的基础上才能建立各国人民之间新式的合作”。
