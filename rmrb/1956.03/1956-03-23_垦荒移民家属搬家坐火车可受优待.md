Homesteading Immigrant Families Can Receive Preferential Treatment When Moving by Train

    Starting April 1st, homesteading immigrant families can enjoy preferential treatment when moving by train. Those with certificates from people's committees at the county level or above and household migration certificates will receive a 50% reduction on the original ticket price when purchasing hard-seat passenger tickets and express train tickets for adults or children; a 50% reduction on the hard-seat ticket price will also be applied when taking special-price trains, simple passenger trains, boxcar-converted passenger trains, and suburban trains. This is stipulated in the recently formulated "Preferential Measures for Homesteading Immigrant Families Taking Trains for Relocation" by the Ministry of Railways. The measures also stipulate that homesteading immigrant families are not subject to weight restrictions when consigning household goods and will be charged according to baggage rates.

    垦荒移民家属搬家坐火车可受优待
    从四月一日起，垦荒移民家属搬家时乘坐火车，可以享受优待。凡是有县级以上人民委员会的证明文件和户口迁移证，购买大人或小孩的硬席客票和快车票的时候，都按原票价减低50％；乘坐特价列车、简易客车、棚车代用客车和市郊列车的时候，也按硬席票价减低50％。这是最近铁道部制定的垦荒移民家属迁移乘车优待办法中规定的。办法中还规定垦荒移民家属托运搬家物品的时候，不受重量限制，并且按行李运价收费。
