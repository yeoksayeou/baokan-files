    The Fifth National Insurance Work Conference, recently held in Beijing, determined that the focus of insurance work will shift to rural areas in the future. This year and next year, rural insurance business will be gradually expanded. At the same time, property insurance and personal insurance in cities will be actively developed, laying the foundation for great development during the Second Five-Year Plan. In 1956, in terms of rural insurance business, livestock insurance will be expanded nationwide, with a focus on pig insurance and rural property insurance, and active preparations will be made to pilot crop insurance next year.

    最近在北京举行的第五次全国保险工作会议确定，今后保险工作重点要转向农村。今年和明年要逐步扩大农村保险业务，同时积极开展城市的财产保险和人身保险，为第二个五年计划期间的大发展打下基础。1956年在农村保险业务方面，要在全国范围内扩大办理牲畜保险，重点办理猪只保险和农村财产保险，并且积极准备在明年试办农作物保险。
