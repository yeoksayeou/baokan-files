A mass movement for spring farmland water conservancy construction has unfolded in various locations with the arrival of the spring plowing season. According to incomplete statistics, across the country in the first half of February, the irrigated area was expanded by approximately 10.69 million mu. Many of the newly built farmland water conservancy projects this spring have already begun to demonstrate their irrigation benefits. In the eight provinces of Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Hunan, and Guangxi alone, more than 200,000 wells were dug and over 20,000 ponds, dams, canals, and small reservoirs were constructed in just over half a month.

Organized farmers have demonstrated unparalleled enthusiasm for various farmland water conservancy projects such as well digging, canal opening, pond excavation, and dam construction. Members of the Toudaoweizi Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ji'an County, Jilin Province, engaged in enthusiastic red flag competitions in well digging and reservoir construction projects, with more than 50 members rising at the first crow of the rooster every day to repair the reservoir. Members of the Xuzhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fuchun Township, Tongcheng County, Anhui Province, carried shovels and baskets to repair ponds on the second day after the Spring Festival. In the Xilingol League of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, many mutual aid group herdsmen organized youth commando teams who dug through several feet of frozen soil in the severe cold of minus twenty or thirty degrees Celsius and dug 500 water wells in more than a month.

Various localities have also paid attention to solving the difficulty of insufficient technical personnel when constructing farmland water conservancy projects. Gaotang, Boping and other counties in Shandong Province have trained more than 5,700 technical workers in well drilling and spring installation. Yilan County, Heilongjiang Province, decided to adopt the method of mutual teaching and learning to train 1,000 various paddy field technicians in the county. The Wuxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Nanfengchang Township, Wu'an County, Hebei Province, invited well-digging technicians from neighboring villages and adopted the method of masters leading apprentices, learning while doing, to build 120 brick wells.

Some places have also made comprehensive and long-term plans to eliminate ordinary waterlogging and drought disasters. Gansu Province plans to basically eliminate ordinary waterlogging and drought disasters in the province within four years (1956 to 1959). By 1959, the province's irrigated area will increase from the existing 9.6 million mu to more than 28.6 million mu, which is estimated to increase grain production by 3.8 billion jin. Guizhou Province has initially planned to eliminate ordinary waterlogging and drought disasters within three years, expanding the irrigated area by 6.47 million mu and improving the irrigated area by 1.6 million mu.

    群众性的兴修农田水利运动
    随着春耕季节的来到，各地展开了群众性的春修农田水利运动。据不完全的统计，全国在2月上、中旬约共扩大灌溉面积1，069万亩，不少地区今春新修的农田水利工程，已开始发挥灌溉效益。仅在河南、河北、山东、山西、陕西、四川、湖南、广西8省，半个多月内就打井20多万眼，兴修塘、坝、渠道、小水库等2万多处。
    组织起来的农民对打井、开渠、挖塘、筑坝等各项农田水利工程表现了无比的热情。吉林省辑安县头道隈子村农业生产合作社社员在打井、修水库工程中，展开了热烈的红旗竞赛，每天鸡叫头遍就有50多名社员起来修水库。安徽省桐城县福春乡徐庄农业生产合作社的社员刚过春节，第二天便扛着铁锹、筐子进行修塘。内蒙古自治区锡林郭勒盟不少互助组的牧民，组织了青年突击队，在零下二、三十度的严寒中，挖开了几尺厚的冻土层，一个多月中，打了500眼水井。
    各地在兴修农田水利工程时，还注意了解决技术力量不足的困难。山东省高唐、博平等县训练了打井、下泉等技术工人5，700多名。黑龙江省依兰县决定采用互教互学的办法，在全县训练各种水田技术手1，000人。河北省武安县南冯昌乡五星农业生产合作社向外村请来了打井技术工人，用师傅带徒弟，边打边学的办法，打成了120眼砖井。
    有些地方还对消灭普通水旱灾害作了全面和长期的规划。甘肃省计划在4年内（1956到1959年）基本上消灭全省普通水旱灾害。到1959年，全省水地面积将从现有的960万亩增加到2，860多万亩，估计可以增产粮食38亿斤。贵州省初步规划了在3年内消灭普通水旱灾害，将扩大灌溉面积647万亩，改善灌溉面积160万亩。
