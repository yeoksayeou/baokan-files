Doing a Good Job in Production is Key to Consolidating Cooperatives
Ma Chaojun, Ouyang Mo

After the Lujiayechang Township Advanced Cooperative in Xin County, Shanxi Province, was formally established on January 17, the Party branch, in order to quickly and orderly lead the members to turn to large-scale production, immediately reorganized the production organization and announced this year's production plan. According to this plan, the average yield per mu of land this year will be increased to 426 jin, an increase of 151 jin compared to the average yield per mu last year. Among them, 500 mu of "Golden Queen" corn will reach a yield of 1,000 jin per mu. The total of 6,318 mu of land in the entire cooperative can increase grain production by more than 944,000 jin. Calculated on the basis of 95,000 workdays for the whole year, each workday can be divided into 1.8 yuan, which is 6 jiao more than last year.

This plan was a great encouragement to most members, but some new members held a skeptical attitude. For example, they believed that new member Du Fuheng was one of the best at growing crops in the village in the past, averaging only about 320 jin per mu. How could the average yield of the entire cooperative suddenly increase to 426 jin? As for having 500 mu of corn reach a yield of 1,000 jin per mu, it was even more unimaginable. Therefore, some new members said: "The plan is good, but I'm afraid it won't be achieved." The Party branch, in response to this ideological concern, adopted the form of individual interviews and discussion meetings to conduct in-depth publicity. The Party branch first publicized the example of increased production in the Yongfeng Cooperative. In 1954, this cooperative had 2 mu of corn that created a record of 1,000 jin per mu. Although there was a severe drought in 1955, there were still several mu of corn that reached a yield of over 900 jin per mu. As for yields of four to five hundred jin per mu, there were even more. Since primary cooperatives can do it, why can't advanced cooperatives do it? Secondly, they also publicized the superiority of advanced cooperatives to everyone, explaining that this superiority is concentrated in further increasing production and increasing the income of members. To achieve this goal, it is not enough to just have a plan. Measures must be taken to implement the plan, which is to dig more wells, apply more fertilizer, and plant more high-yield crops. As long as we can do this, the current production increase plan can certainly be completed, and we can also strive to exceed it. After such publicity, some new members dispelled their doubts about increasing production.

However, when the branch proposed that the entire cooperative should dig 60 water wells this year and expand the irrigated area by 1,800 mu, some members became concerned again. Although they knew that digging wells was the most effective way to prevent drought and ensure increased production, they were intimidated by the difficulties. Some members said: "We need wood, but there is no wood; we need stone, but there is no stone; it costs a lot of money, but we get little benefit." In order to dispel these members' concerns, the Party branch again carried out in-depth publicity and explanation work. The Party branch used the example of last year's prolonged drought, which caused a large number of seedlings to wither, to explain to everyone that in order to fight the drought and save the seedlings at that time, everyone was mobilized to carry water to irrigate the land, which cost a lot of labor. Not only did it not completely avoid a large reduction in production, but it also delayed the middle tillage and processing. If this labor were used to dig wells during the slack season, it would not only avoid delaying farming due to carrying water to irrigate the land during a drought, but it could also ensure a bumper harvest of crops. This is a win-win situation. How can you say "it costs a lot of money, but we get little benefit"? The Party branch also calculated an account for everyone. One well can irrigate 30 mu of land and increase grain production by 3,000 jin. The entire cost of digging the well can be recovered in less than three years. If you are only afraid of spending more money and effort in the short term, where will you get more grain and a happier life? As for the problem of no stone, the branch decided to adopt the following two methods to solve it: one method is to open a stone mountain, and veteran soldier Lu Quanxi and others introduced their experience in opening stone mountains on the Korean battlefield. The other method is to dig up the bunkers built by the enemy in the past and pick up broken stones.

After dispelling the members' ideological concerns and launching the well-digging campaign, the Party branch immediately carried out ideological mobilization for fertilizer accumulation in order to achieve the plan of applying 32 dan of fertilizer per mu. At that time, there was a major obstacle to carrying out fertilizer accumulation, which was the lack of a large amount of fertilizer sources. When the Party branch, based on the experience of other places, proposed using corn stalks to make compost, it was again opposed by some members. There were two reasons for these members' opposition: first, they were afraid that if the corn stalks were composted into fertilizer, there would be no firewood to burn; second, they did not believe that corn stalks could be composted into fertilizer. The Party branch decided that the cooperative would exchange coal for the members' corn stalks to ensure that the members would not have difficulty burning firewood; and it also made a practical experiment of composting corn stalks into fertilizer, and organized members to visit, to dispel the members' ideological concerns that they did not believe that corn stalks could be composted into fertilizer. After doing this, all the members were convinced. Everyone agreed that as long as there is water and fertilizer, there is no problem with increasing production.

In order to further unleash the production enthusiasm of the members, the Party branch believed that it was necessary to implement the principle of distribution according to work. Therefore, the Party branch classified, ranked, analyzed, and studied the various tasks of well digging and fertilizer accumulation, and determined different work-point rewards according to the lightness, heaviness, difficulty, and ease of the work. For example, a workday in the well was recorded as 20 points, a workday on the well was recorded as 7 to 9 points, 1,000 jin of broken stones was recorded as 10 work points, and picking up fertilizer in the city initially recorded 10 points for 60 dan, and later, according to the gradual reduction of fertilizer sources, it was changed to recording 10 points for 50 dan and then 40 dan. In this way, a piece-rate contracting system was implemented for many tasks. This consolidated everyone's production enthusiasm on the basis of distribution according to work. Because this Party branch promptly put forward a production plan, promptly dispelled the members' various ideological concerns, and promptly launched a production increase campaign, it enabled this advanced cooperative to be quickly consolidated through production, ensuring the reliable realization of the production increase plan.

    搞好生产是巩固合作社的关键
    马超骏　欧阳默
    山西忻县芦家野场乡高级社在1月17日正式成立以后，党支部为了迅速地、有秩序地领导社员转向大生产运动，立即整顿了生产组织，宣布了今年的生产计划。按照这个计划，今年每亩土地平均产量要提高到426斤，比去年每亩平均产量增加151斤。其中有500亩金皇后玉米每亩产量要达到1，000斤。全社6，318亩土地，共可增产粮食944，000多斤。全年按做95，000个劳动日计算，每个劳动日可分到1.8元，比去年多分6角多。
    这一计划对大部分社员是一个很大的鼓舞，但也有一部分新社员抱着怀疑的态度。比如他们认为新社员杜富恒过去在村上种庄稼是数一数二的好手，平均每亩也只能收到320斤左右，全社的平均产量怎么能一下就提高到426斤呢？至于要500亩玉米达到亩产1，000斤，就更不可想像了。因此，有的新社员说：“计划好是好，就怕达不到”。党支部就针对这种思想顾虑，采取个别访问谈话和召开座谈会的形式做了深入的宣传。党支部首先向他们宣传了永丰社增产的事例。这个社在1954年就有2亩玉米创造了每亩产量1，000斤的纪录。1955年虽然有严重的旱灾，也有几亩玉米每亩产量达到900斤以上。至于每亩产量四、五百斤的就更多了。既然初级社可以办到的事为什么高级社还不能办到呢？其次，还向大家宣传了高级社的优越性，说明这种优越性集中地表现在要进一步增加生产，增加社员的收入。为了达到这个目的，仅仅有计划是不够的，必须采取实现计划的措施，这就是要多打井，多施肥，多种高产作物。只要能够这样办，现在的增产计划一定可以完成，而且还可以争取超过。经过这样一番宣传以后，部分新社员对增产的疑虑打消了。
    可是，当支部提出全社今年要打水井60眼，扩大灌溉面积1，800亩的时候，部分社员又产生了顾虑，他们虽然知道打井是防止旱灾保证增产的最有效的办法，可是他们被困难吓住了。有些社员说：“要木料，没木料，要石料，没石料，花钱多，得利少。”党支部为了解除这些社员的顾虑，又做了深入的宣传解释工作。党支部以去年久旱不雨，青苗大批枯死为例向大家说明，当时为了抗旱抢苗，发动大家挑水浇地，花了多少劳力，不但没有完全避免大量减产，还耽误了中耕加工。如果把这些劳力在农闲时候用来打井，既不会在天旱时由于挑水浇地误了农时，又可以保证庄稼丰收，这是一举两得的事，怎么能说“花钱多，得利少”呢？党支部还向大家算了一笔帐，一眼井能浇30亩土地，可增产3，000斤粮，不上三年，即可收回打井的全部资金。如果只怕眼前多花一些钱，多费一些工，哪里会有更多的粮食，更幸福的生活呢？至于没石料的问题，支部决定采取以下两种办法解决：一种办法是开石山，并由转业军人卢全喜等介绍了他们在朝鲜战场上开石山的经验。另外一种办法是挖敌人过去修筑的碉堡和拣碎石。
    在解除了社员的思想顾虑，展开打井运动以后，党支部又立即进行积肥的思想发动工作，以便达到每亩施肥32担的计划。当时，开展积肥有一个主要障碍就是没有大量的肥源。当党支部根据别的地方的经验提出用玉米秆沤肥的时候，又遭到了部分社员的反对。这些社员反对的理由有二，一是害怕玉米秆沤了肥料没柴烧；二是不相信玉米秆能沤成肥料。党支部就决定社里要用煤炭兑换社员的玉米秆，保证社员烧火不会发生困难；又特地作了玉米秆沤肥料的实际试验，组织社员参观，解除社员不相信玉米秆能沤肥料的思想顾虑。这样做了以后，所有社员都信服了。大家一致认为只要有水又有肥料，增产没问题。
    为了进一步发挥社员的生产积极性，党支部认为必须贯彻按劳取酬的原则。于是，党支部就对打井和积肥的各种活作了分类排队，分析研究，按照活的轻、重、难、易确定了不同的工分报酬。比如井下的工一个记20分，井上的工一个记7分到9分，拣碎石1000斤记10分工，进城拾肥料，开始是60担记十分，以后根据肥料来源逐渐减少的情况，改为拾50担拾40担记10分。这样，就对很多活路实行了计件包工制。这就使大家的生产积极性在按劳取酬的基础上巩固起来了。由于这个党支部及时提出了生产计划，及时解除了社员各种思想顾虑，及时开展了增产运动，就使这个高级社通过生产迅速地巩固起来，使增产计划的实现有了可靠的保证。
