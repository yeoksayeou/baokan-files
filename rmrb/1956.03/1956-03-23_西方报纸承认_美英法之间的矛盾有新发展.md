Xinhua News Agency dispatch:
Western newspapers acknowledge that anxieties over the repeated failures of the "policy of strength," along with complaints and attacks among allied nations, are currently major focuses of commentary in the American, British, and French press.
Western observers concede that the emergence of new circumstances within the Western camp is inseparable from the powerful influence of the Soviet Union's peaceful diplomatic policies in the international situation and the upsurge of colonial people's liberation struggles. An Associated Press dispatch from Washington not long ago stated that, for the West, the situation in various regions of the world has become "increasingly uncontrollable," and because of this situation, "tensions among the three allies," with their differing interests and considerations, "may increase." It is becoming "more difficult" for the US, Britain, and France "to formulate, discuss, and agree on some fundamentally different, bold, and significant new policies to resist the Soviet (peaceful) offensive."
Western newspapers are paying particular attention to the attitude expressed by Pineau in his speech on March 2. Pineau's remarks were regarded by Robert of the "New York Times" Washington bureau as "frankly questioning Washington's leadership in the current stage of the economic and psychological competition between East and West." Regarding Britain's attitude, according to the Associated Press, Washington's diplomatic experts, in assessing Britain's attitude towards Pineau's speech, believe that "compared to Dulles' opinions, it (referring to the British government) would be more inclined to support Pineau's opinions. British public opinion often strongly opposes Dulles' 'brink of war' rhetoric."
Western newspaper reports also reflect that the differences between the US, Britain, and France are becoming more apparent on some important issues. According to Western news agencies, the French government attaches great importance to the issue of disarmament. Following the Mollet-Eden talks, Britain and France, based on the French plan, drafted a joint Anglo-French disarmament plan. However, according to Reuters, this plan was met with "denunciation" from the US side.
On the issue of East-West trade, the governments of some Western European countries, led by Britain and under great pressure from their own business communities, have recently been striving to get the US to agree to relax the trade "embargo" against China. But according to Reuters, "the United States is resisting British pressure (in this regard)" and is deliberately dragging its feet on the issue.
New developments in the Middle East situation have also further deepened the discord among the major partners of the Western alliance. Britain, which has suffered setbacks in the Middle East due to the failure of the Baghdad Pact military treaty policy, is complaining that the United States has not provided sufficient support for its Middle East policy. Associated Press news analyst Roberts said that the British criticized the United States for initiating the Baghdad Pact but refusing to join it themselves. Britain's "Daily Mail" warned that if Britain is driven out of the Middle East, the United States will sooner or later be driven out as well. Commentaries in newspapers on both sides of the Atlantic make no secret of the fact that the conflict between the two countries' oil interests in the Middle East is deepening the Anglo-American discord.
The conflict between the US and Britain has recently erupted sharply over the Cyprus issue. The "sympathy" shown by the United States to Greece after the colonial authorities in Cyprus exiled Archbishop Makarios has aroused the censure of British newspapers reflecting the interests of the colonial group. The "Daily Mail" said that the British were "shocked, angry, and resentful" at the attitude of the United States. An editorial in "The Times" stated: "Cyprus is a British interest, more so than it is an interest of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization."
The Spanish newspaper "Última Hora" commented on the contradictions between the US and Britain on the Cyprus issue, pointing out that the United States supports Greece against Britain because Britain is trying to bring France together to prevent the United States from intervening in the Mediterranean region.

### 西方报纸承认  美英法之间的矛盾有新发展

    西方报纸承认
    美英法之间的矛盾有新发展
    据新华社讯　对于“实力政策”不断失败的焦虑，对同盟国的埋怨和攻讦：这是美、英、法报界目前评论的主要中心之一。
    西方观察家承认，西方阵营出现的新情况是同国际局势中苏联和平外交政策的强有力的影响以及殖民地人民解放斗争的高涨分不开的。美联社不久以前从华盛顿发出的一条电讯说，对于西方来说，世界各个地区的局势已经“越来越无法控制”，由于这种情况，利害不同和各有考虑的“三个盟国之间的紧张局势可能日益增长”。美英法三国“要制定、讨论和同意一些根本不同的、大胆的和重大的新政策来抵制苏联的（和平）攻势”是“更为困难了”。
    西方报纸特别注意比诺在三月二日的演说中所表明的态度。比诺的谈话被“纽约时报”驻华盛顿记者阿伯尔认为是“坦率地对华盛顿在东西方之间的经济竞赛和心理竞赛的现阶段中的领导权提出了问题”。至于英国的态度，据美联社报道，华盛顿的外交专家们在就比诺的演说估计英国的态度时认为，“同杜勒斯的意见比较起来，它（指英国政府）大约将更倾向于支持比诺的意见。英国舆论界经常强烈反对杜勒斯‘战争边缘’之类的言论。”
    西方报纸消息同时反映出：美英法三国的分歧在一些重要的问题上表现得更加明显。据西方通讯社报道，法国政府非常重视裁军问题。在摩勒—艾登会谈以后，英法两国在法国计划的基础上，拟订了一个英法联合裁军计划。但是，据路透社说，这个计划遭到了美国方面的“非难”。
    在东西方贸易问题上，以英国为首的受到它们本国的企业界人士很大压力的一些西欧国家的政府，最近竭力要求美国同意放宽对中国的贸易“禁运”。但是据路透社说，“美国正在抗拒英国（在这方面）的压力”，并且故意在这个问题上拖延不决。
    中东局势的新发展也使得西方联盟主要伙伴间的不和进一步加深。因为巴格达军事条约政策失败而在中东重重栽了筋斗的英国，正在埋怨美国对它的中东政策支持不力。美联社新闻分析员罗伯茨说，英国人批评美国发起缔结巴格达条约，可是自己却不愿意参加。英国的“每日邮报”警告说，如果英国被赶出中东，美国迟早也要被赶出。大西洋两岸的报纸在评论中毫不讳言加深英美不和的是两国在中东的石油利益的冲突。
    美英之间的冲突最近在塞浦路斯问题上也尖锐地爆发了出来。美国在塞浦路斯殖民当局放逐马卡里奥斯大主教后向希腊表示的“同情”，引起了反映殖民集团利益的英国报纸的责难。“每日邮报”说，英国人对美国的态度感到“吃惊、愤怒和怨恨”。“泰晤士报”社论说：“塞浦路斯是英国的利益，甚于它是北大西洋公约组织的利益。”
    西班牙报纸“终极报”在评论美、英在塞浦路斯问题上的矛盾的时候指出，美国支持希腊反对英国，是因为英国竭力把法国拉在一起来防止美国插足地中海地区。
