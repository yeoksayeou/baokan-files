Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 9th: The Governor of Kashmir State, Yuvraj Karan Singh, said in the State Assembly on March 7 that large and small countries are now increasingly aware of the "indestructible" connection that exists between the people of Kashmir and India.

He said he was pleased with the prospects opened up by the merger of Kashmir and India. He said that as an inseparable part of India, Kashmir is proud of the prestige that India enjoys under the leadership of Prime Minister Nehru.

Singh also said that he highly valued the remarks made by the Soviet leaders during their visit to India last December regarding the future of Kashmir.

At that time, Khrushchev pointed out that the issue of Kashmir as a state of the Republic of India had already been resolved by the people of Kashmir themselves.

    克什米尔邦邦长在邦议会上谈克什米尔和印度的联系
    新华社新德里9日电　克什米尔邦邦长尤弗拉格·卡兰·辛格3月7日在邦议会上说，大小国家现在愈来愈认识到存在于克什米尔人民同印度之间的“不可摧毁”的联系。
    他说，他对于克什米尔和印度合并所打开的远景感到高兴。他说，作为印度的不可分的一部分，克什米尔对于印度在尼赫鲁总理领导下所享有的威望感到自豪。
    辛格还说，他非常重视苏联领导人去年12月访问印度的时候所发表的关于克什米尔前途的说法。
    当时，赫鲁晓夫指出，作为印度共和国的一个邦的克什米尔的问题已经由克什米尔人民自己解决了。
