    Oppose the Ugly Farce of South Vietnam's "Separate Election"
    Today, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is conducting a so-called "election" in South Vietnam. According to the Geneva Accords, Vietnam should hold free nationwide elections in July of this year, and the two sides of Vietnam should have begun consultations on this issue since July of last year. However, under the instigation and support of the United States, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique has, on the one hand, openly opposed holding free all-Vietnam elections as scheduled, and has so far refused to begin consultations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on this election; on the other hand, it has staged this ugly farce of a separate "election" in South Vietnam, preparing to establish a separate "Constituent Assembly" of South Vietnam and formulate a separate "Constitution" of South Vietnam. This practice by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique seriously violates the provisions of the Geneva Accords regarding the peaceful reunification of Vietnam and has aroused strong opposition from all strata of the Vietnamese people and international public opinion.
    In order to ensure its victory in the separate election, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique has intensified its reign of terror in South Vietnam during this period. They further suppressed former resistance members and all other democratic forces in South Vietnam. According to incomplete statistics, from the ceasefire in Vietnam to the end of last year, approximately 40,000 former resistance members and other democratic forces in South Vietnam have been arrested and killed. With the separate "election" approaching, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique issued another decree on January 11 this year, openly establishing concentration camps throughout the country to imprison those they call "endangering national defense and public security." In the past month or two, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique has also dispatched military police to occupy the headquarters of opposition parties in South Vietnam and arrested opposition party leaders. They have also formulated an "election law" that all opposition parties in South Vietnam believe "does not guarantee the basic democratic rights for opposition parties to operate" and have unanimously and resolutely opposed. The Ngo Dinh Diem clique also continues to close down newspapers and stipulates that all newspapers are uniformly distributed by the South Vietnamese police bureau. Leaders of South Vietnamese opposition parties recently pointed out that there is currently no democracy or freedom in South Vietnam. Political leaders are not allowed to organize political parties or freely express their views. Strict press censorship has been forcibly implemented. Under these circumstances, the March 4 election can only be a trick and a fraud. All opposition parties in South Vietnam have decided to "boycott" this separate "election."
    As the Indian "Free Press" recently commented on the separate "election" in South Vietnam, all the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's actions to undermine the Geneva Accords have been carried out with the active support of the United States. Not long ago, the Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Radford, who visited South Vietnam, clearly stated: "In addition to providing Ngo Dinh Diem with military assistance to establish an army like that of South Korea, the United States should also help Ngo Dinh Diem establish a provisional parliament and formulate a constitution for South Vietnam as soon as possible." In order to provide South Vietnam with the latter kind of "help," the United States specially sent a group of "legal experts." This approach by the United States is part of its conspiracy to permanently divide Vietnam and continue to maintain South Vietnam as its military base and colony. The Vietnamese people, who care about the fate of their motherland's independence and unification, both in North Vietnam and in the increasingly terror-stricken South Vietnam, are waging a resolute struggle to oppose this conspiracy of the United States. All countries and people who care about maintaining peace in Indochina and Asia must not allow this conspiracy of the United States to continue to develop.
    The implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam is currently being seriously undermined. According to the provisions of the Geneva Accords, when the implementation of the agreement is threatened, the participating countries of the Geneva Conference should consult with each other in order to study the measures necessary to ensure that the agreement is respected. The Chinese government has proposed reconvening the Geneva Conference and believes that this conference should invite the three member states of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam to participate in jointly discussing the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Polish government have also written to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, making the same suggestion. The Chinese people fully support this proposal. They demand that the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference conduct consultations without delay and make the necessary arrangements to reconvene the Geneva Conference. All participating countries of the Geneva Conference have a responsibility and obligation to seek and determine the specific steps necessary to ensure the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam.

### 反对南越“单独选举”的丑剧

    反对南越“单独选举”的丑剧
    今天，吴庭艳集团在南越进行所谓“选举”。按照日内瓦协议的规定，越南应该在今年7月举行全国性的自由选举，而越南双方应该从去年7月起就此问题进行协商。但是，吴庭艳集团在美国指使和支持之下，一面公开反对如期举行全越南自由选举，至今还拒绝同越南民主共和国方面开始有关这一选举的协商；另一面却在南越演出了这一出单独“选举”的丑剧，准备成立南越单独的“制宪议会”，制定南越单独的“宪法”。吴庭艳集团这种做法，严重违反了日内瓦协议关于实现越南和平统一的条款，引起了越南各阶层人民和国际舆论的强烈反对。
    为了保证自己在单独选举中的胜利，吴庭艳集团这一段时期来加紧了对南越的恐怖统治。他们进一步镇压南越前抗战人员和其他一切民主力量。据不完全的统计，从越南停战到去年年底，南越前抗战人员和其他民主力量被捕被杀的，已达4万人左右。随着单独“选举”的逼近，吴庭艳集团在今年1月11日又颁布了一项法令，公开在全国各地建立集中营，把他们称之为“危害国防和公共安宁”的人关进去。近一两个月来，吴庭艳集团并在南越派遣军警占领了反对党的总部，逮捕了反对党的领袖。他们还制定了所有南越的反对党都认为“没有保证反对党进行活动的基本民主权利”而一致坚决予以反对的“选举法”。吴庭艳集团还继续封闭报馆，规定所有报纸都由南越的警察局统一发行。南越反对党的领袖最近曾指出，目前在南越，民主自由是不存在的。不允许政治领袖们组织政党或者自由地表达自己的主张。强制施行了严格的新闻检查。在这种情况下，3月4日的选举只能是一种诡计和骗局。南越所有的反对党都已经决定“抵制”这次单独“选举”。
    正如印度“自由新闻”最近评论南越单独“选举”时所指出，吴庭艳集团所有破坏日内瓦协议的行为，都是在美国的积极支持下进行的。不久前访问南越的美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福就曾经明白地说：“除了给予吴庭艳以军事援助来建立南朝鲜式的军队外，美国还应该帮助吴庭艳尽快地建立临时议会并制定南越宪法。”为了给予南越后一种“帮助”，美国曾特地派来了一批“法律专家”。美国的这种做法，是它企图长期分裂越南、继续保持南越作为自己的军事基地和殖民地的阴谋的一部分。关心祖国独立和统一的命运的越南人民，不论是在北越或是在恐怖气氛日益增加的南越，都正为反对美国这一阴谋而展开坚决的斗争。关心维护印度支那和亚洲和平的一切国家和人民，也决不能容许美国这一阴谋继续发展下去。
    日内瓦协议在越南的实施目前正遭到严重的破坏。按照日内瓦协议的规定，在协议实施遭到威胁时，日内瓦会议的与会各国应该彼此进行协商，以便研究为保证协议被尊重所必需的措施。中国政府已经建议重新召开日内瓦会议，并且认为这一会议应该邀请越南国际委员会的三个委员国参加，来共同讨论日内瓦协议在越南的实施问题。越南民主共和国政府和波兰政府也已经写信给日内瓦会议两位主席，提出了同样的建议。中国人民完全支持这种建议。他们要求日内瓦会议两位主席将不迟延地进行协商，并作出必要的安排来重新召开日内瓦会议。所有日内瓦会议的与会各国，都有责任和义务来寻求并确定为保证日内瓦协议在越南的实施所必需采取的具体步骤。
