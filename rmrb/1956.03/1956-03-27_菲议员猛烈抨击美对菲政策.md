Xinhua News Agency, Manila, March 26th: Philippine legislators and political figures vehemently criticized American policy towards the Philippines on March 25th.

    House Speaker Jose Laurel Jr., speaking to the graduating class of Lyceum of Luzon in Laoag, said that the Philippines is not yet a truly sovereign nation because it is under "a new yoke of oppression, more subtle and therefore more despicable."

    He said that today's "new oppression" is imposed on a loyal and honest people in the name of the democracy and freedom traditionally upheld by the United States.

    He said, "Filipinos are treated as intruders in their own territory, not as masters, as people of a dependency and not as an autonomous nation."

    He said, "I am sure that in saying this, I am reflecting the sentiments of the Filipino people: the United States that we recognize and acknowledge is not the United States that only knows vested interests and practices racial discrimination, not the United States that practices political bossism and political patronage."

    House Majority Leader Arturo Tolentino also accused the United States of being responsible for the Philippines' "economic chaos." He said that there is no balanced trade between the two countries and that the purpose of importing American culture into the Philippines is to cultivate Filipinos into potential consumers of American-made luxury goods.

    Senator Lorenzo Sumulong, in another speech, accused the United States' so-called free trade with the Philippines of causing the Philippines' economic difficulties.

    Jose Laurel Jr.'s speech has received particular attention throughout the Philippines. The "Manila Chronicle" said: he "strongly demonstrated the nationalist sentiment prevalent in Congress."

    菲议员猛烈抨击美对菲政策
    据新华社26日讯　马尼拉消息：菲律宾议员和政界人士在三月二十五日猛烈抨击美国对菲律宾的政策。
    众议院议长小何赛·劳雷尔在捞牛坂对吕宋大学的毕业班学生讲话的时候说：菲律宾目前还不是真正有主权的国家，因为它处于“一种更加巧妙因而也就更加卑鄙的新的压迫的铁蹄”之下。
    他说：今天的“新的压迫”是在受美国的传统维护的那种民主和自由的名义下强加在一个忠厚信实的人民身上的。
    他说：“菲律宾人在自己的领土上被当作侵夺者，而不是被当作主人翁看待，被当作附属国人民而不是被当作自主民族看待。”
    他说：“我确信，我在说这样的话的时候是反映了菲律宾人民的情绪的：我们所认识并且承认的美国，不是只知既得利益和施行种族歧视的美国，不是施行政治把头主义和在政治上笼络人心的美国。”
    众议院多数派领袖阿图罗·托伦蒂诺也指责美国应对菲律宾的“经济混乱现象”负责。他说，两国之间没有进行平衡的贸易和把美国文化输入菲律宾的目的是要把菲律宾人培育成美制奢侈品的潜在消费者。
    参议员罗伦佐·苏木朗在另外一次谈话中指责美国对菲律宾的所谓自由贸易造成了菲律宾的经济困难。
    小何赛·劳雷尔的演说特别受到菲律宾全国的注意。“马尼拉纪事报”说：他“强烈地表明了国会中流行的民族主义情绪”。
