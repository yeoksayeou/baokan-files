The Magnificent Epic of the Vietnamese People's Heroic Struggle
——Introducing the Color Documentary Film "Vietnam"——

Directed by: Kalman Produced by the Central Documentary Film Studio of the Soviet Union

The Vietnamese people have achieved a great victory in their struggle for independence, freedom, and peace. With their heroic deeds, they have written a magnificent epic in the history of colonial peoples' liberation movements! Vietnam is a country of struggle, a country of heroes, and also a country rich in resources and beautiful scenery. However, for more than 80 years, this rich land has been ravaged and invaded by foreign colonialists. Suffering has not worn down the will of the heroic Vietnamese people. Under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and its predecessor, the Indochinese Communist Party, the Vietnamese people stood up and launched a desperate struggle against the invaders, finally defeating them and achieving victory. "Vietnam" is an excellent color documentary film that comprehensively reflects the Vietnamese people's fighting life and their immortal struggle.

"Vietnam" was produced through the close cooperation of filmmakers from both the Soviet Union and Vietnam. The film begins with a grand festive parade: warm sunshine illuminates the earth, free red flags flutter in the blue sky, and the great square of Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, is surging with waves of people, their faces beaming with happy smiles. These are days of peace, days of happiness! But happiness does not come easily; it is obtained through long and arduous struggle, and exchanged for the blood of countless heroes. The film then takes us into the years of the Vietnamese people's arduous struggle.

At the end of 1946, the French invaders broke the armistice agreement, occupied Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, by surprise attack, and attempted to destroy Vietnam with a "quick victory." But the imperialists' wishful thinking was wrong. Not only did the Vietnamese people not succumb, but they also inflicted serious blows on them.

The scene of the Vietnamese people persisting in combat is very moving. The film vividly expresses the Vietnamese people's staunch and unyielding will. Workers risked their lives to move all the factory equipment into the jungle, and manufactured weapons to strike the enemy in the jungle and caves; farmers organized militia teams to fight alongside the People's Army; the People's Army used clever tactics to strike the enemy unpredictably, and grew and strengthened in the struggle, developing from a resistance force of 38 people into a strong and modern national defense force. Vietnam's nationwide resistance war penetrated every corner. From Friendship Pass to Cape Ca Mau, every Vietnamese person contributed their greatest strength to this struggle.

In the face of the people's powerful forces, the invaders succumbed. From the film, we see the heroic Vietnamese People's Army entering liberated Hanoi amidst the cheers of the people. Then a historically significant shot appears on the screen: French soldiers at the gate of the Hanoi puppet "Governor's Mansion" anxiously endure the last minute of their duty here. When the Vietnamese People's Army marches onto this post with majestic steps, the film uses facts to declare to the people: more than 80 years of colonial rule have come to an end, and the soldiers of the Vietnamese People's Army have rightfully taken their glorious post.

The film finally depicts the great achievements made by the Vietnamese people during the recovery and construction period. Workers are working diligently, farmers are harvesting crops, and people are building their motherland and a happy new life with selfless labor.

The film "Vietnam" is a great epic that vividly recreates the Vietnamese people's struggle against aggression on the screen. The Chinese people will draw encouragement and strength from the film, and at the same time will surely enhance their understanding of Vietnam and strengthen the fraternal friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam through the film.

    越南人民英勇斗争的壮丽诗篇
    ——介绍彩色纪录影片“越南”——
    陈安京
    编导：卡尔曼　苏联中央纪录电影制片厂出品
    越南人民在争取独立、自由与和平的斗争中取得了伟大的胜利，越南人民用英勇的斗争事迹在殖民地人民解放运动史上写下了壮丽的诗篇！越南，是一个战斗的国家，英雄的国家，也是一个物产丰富、景色幽美的国家。但是80多年来，这块富饶的土地，却一直受着外国殖民者的蹂躏和侵略。苦难并没有磨损英雄的越南人民的意志，在越南劳动党及其前身印度支那共产党的领导下，越南人民站了起来，跟侵略者展开了殊死的斗争，最后终于打败了侵略者，取得了胜利。“越南”就是一部反映越南人民的全面的战斗生活和他们不朽的斗争事迹的优秀的彩色纪录影片。
    “越南”是在苏联和越南两国电影工作者亲密合作下摄制成的。影片从盛大的节日游行开始：温暖的阳光照耀着大地，自由的红旗在蓝空中迎风飘扬，越南民主共和国的首都——河内的大广场上汹涌着人的浪潮，人们的脸上都洋溢着幸福的微笑。这是和平的日子，幸福的日子！但是幸福不是轻易得来的；幸福是经过长期艰苦斗争，是用无数英雄的鲜血换来的。影片接着把我们带进了越南人民艰苦斗争的年代里。
    1946年底，法国侵略者破坏了停战协定，用突然袭击的方法侵占了越南民主共和国的首都河内，并且企图用“速战速决”的办法，灭亡越南。但是帝国主义者的如意算盘打错了，越南人民不但没有屈服，反而给予他们严重的打击。
    越南人民坚持战斗的情景，是非常动人的。影片把越南人民的坚贞不屈的意志形象地表现了出来。工人们冒着生命危险把工厂的全部设备搬进了丛林，在丛林和山洞中制造出打击敌人的武器；农民组织了民兵队伍，和人民军队并肩作战；人民军队更以巧妙的战术神出鬼没地打击敌人，并且在斗争中成长、壮大起来，从38人的抗战队伍发展成为一支坚强的现代化的国防军。越南的全民抗战，深入到每一个角落，从睦南关到金瓯角，每一个越南人民都在这场斗争中付出他们最大的力量。
    在人民强大的力量面前，侵略者屈服了。从影片里面，我们看到英雄的越南人民军在人民的欢呼声中进入解放了的河内。接着一个具有历史意义的镜头出现在银幕上：河内伪“总督府”门口的法国兵，愁眉苦脸地熬过他在这里的最后一分钟的值班。当越南人民军迈着雄伟的步子走上这个岗位的时候，影片用事实向人们宣告：80多年的殖民统治从此结束，越南人民军战士理所当然地站上了自己的光荣的岗位。
    影片最后描叙了越南人民在恢复建设期中取得的巨大成就。工人在勤恳地工作，农民在收庄稼，人们正以忘我的劳动来建设祖国，建设幸福的新生活。
    影片“越南”是一部伟大的史诗，它将越南人民反抗侵略的斗争生动地再现在银幕上。中国人民将从影片中得到鼓舞和力量，同时必将通过影片增进对越南的了解，加强中越两国人民兄弟般的友谊。
