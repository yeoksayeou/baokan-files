The young volunteer reclamation team members of the Luobei Youth Reclamation Area on the Heilongjiang border have successfully weathered their first harsh winter and are now greeting their first spring in building the frontier of the motherland with full confidence.

Half a year ago, the first batch of young volunteer reclamation team members from Beijing arrived in the reclamation area. Subsequently, youth reclamation teams from Tianjin, Hebei, Harbin and other places also arrived. More than 700 young people built the first batch of houses on this vast wilderness and began the battle to advance into the wasteland. The first difficulty they encountered was a lack of skilled production techniques. When Li Shuxiang, a female team member from the suburbs of the capital, started to use a double-bladed plow to cultivate the virgin wasteland, she couldn't exert any strength in her arms. When she encountered soil resistance, the horse would pull hard, and the plow would shake violently, throwing her far away, but she would immediately get up and continue to guide the plow forward. Through careful study and hard work, she soon became a skilled plow operator. The team members who went up the mountain to log had never seen such a dense virgin forest as the Lesser Khingan Mountains, let alone knew the skills of logging. As a result, the trees they sawed down were supported by the unfelled trees next to them and could not fall. However, the team members humbly learned from local farmers with logging experience and promptly summarized the experience they gained in their work, quickly changing the situation. Each group quickly increased its average daily felling from twelve trees to eighty trees. Later, one group felled a maximum of 240 trees in one day. During this winter, a total of 130 team members learned to log, 53 learned how to raise horses, and 72 mastered skilled driving techniques.

The harsh winter on the wasteland was a test for all the team members. In November, the vast grassland was covered with snow. In order to prepare timber for the construction of the farm, the reclamation team's logging team entered the forests of the Lesser Khingan Mountains with the approval of the local government. More than 90 people lived in canvas tents erected on the snow and temporary sheds built of grass. Although several large stoves were lit, the temperature in the tents remained below zero. When they woke up in the morning, their quilts were covered with a layer of frost. But no one was willing to back down. When they swung their axes and pulled the saws to fell trees, they completely forgot about the cold. Many people took off their cotton coats and were still sweating. In this harsh environment of deep mountains and dense forests, the young men still arranged an interesting life order for themselves. The campsite regularly published wall newspapers, praising outstanding team members and encouraging partners with poorer performance. A ball field was built next to the tent, and they played ball after running every morning. In the evening, they gathered around the stove in the tent, sang songs they had composed themselves, or held meetings to exchange production experiences. They overfulfilled the logging task within the prescribed time. The transport team also set out in the wind and snow without fail. On December 16 last year, eight large carts and seventeen team members of the transport team encountered a cold wave on their way to Luobei Town to transport supplies. The temperature dropped to minus 39 degrees Celsius, and the northwest wind stung people's faces like needles, but no one retreated. They encouraged each other and sang a song they had improvised aloud: "The Great Northern Wilderness, a good place, thousands of years of wasteland will build farms... We don't think about the current cold, but only about the beautiful scene in the future..." They safely reached their destination at around eight o'clock.

In this heroic cause of building the frontier of the motherland, these reclamation team members from all sides are lovingly united. The idea of loving the collective has become richer and richer among the team members day by day. Seventeen-year-old Li Laohu was still a primary school student a few months ago. During the sixty days of logging on the mountain, not only did he not take a single day off, but he also automatically carried a section of wood back from the mountain every day, split it and burned it to keep the team members warm. Deng Guiying, the female administrator of the Fourth Brigade, often cared for others, and even many older team members called her Sister Deng.

In the past six months, the team members have deeply fallen in love with this vast and fertile land. The team members have also created dozens of poems to praise the "Great Northern Wilderness". The local residents all said: "The reclamation team members have many happy things, and they must sing whenever they work."

Now, the reclamation team members are preparing to welcome more than 1,700 new team members who will be coming soon from Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei and other places. The No. 12 farm site, three li away from the "Youth Village" established by the reclamation team members, is one of the eighteen collective farms to be established in the Youth Reclamation Area this year. Now, male and female team members are busy building temporary grass sheds for themselves and the large number of new partners who will be coming soon to live in. As soon as spring arrives, they will sow seeds together on more than 5,000 hectares of newly cultivated virgin land, and carry out the construction project of 1,300 houses in eighteen new villages. Next year, the number of reclamation team members will increase to 6,000, the reclaimed wasteland will be more than 20,000 hectares, and the grain produced will be tens of millions of kilograms. The reclamation team members proudly stated: They must build the Youth Reclamation Area into a rice-rich agricultural area in a short period of time, and at the same time establish their own happy families.

    建设青年垦区的人们
    新华社记者　于长钦　马新仁
    黑龙江边萝北青年垦区的青年志愿垦荒队员们，已经胜利地度过了第一个严酷的冬天，正在满怀信心地迎接着建设祖国边疆的第一个春天。
    半年以前，来自北京的第一批青年志愿垦荒队员们来到了垦区，接着，天津、河北、哈尔滨等地的青年垦荒队也相继到来了。七百多名青年在这广阔的荒原上盖起了第一批房舍，开始了向荒地进军的战斗。他们首先遇到的困难是缺乏熟练的生产技术。来自首都郊区的女队员李淑香，开始扶双铧犁开垦原始荒地的时候，两臂使不上力，遇到土壤阻力大的地方，马猛用劲拉，犁身猛一震动，就把她甩出去好远，但她立刻爬起来再扶犁前进。由于她细心钻研和刻苦锻炼，不久就成了熟练的扶犁手。上山伐木的队员们从来没见过小兴安岭那样茂密的原始森林，更不懂伐木的技巧，结果锯下来的树就被旁边没伐的树撑住放不倒。但是队员们虚心地向当地有伐木经验的农民学习，并且及时总结了自己在劳动中摸索到的经验，很快就改变了这种情况。每个小组很快就由平均一天伐十二棵树提高到八十棵，后来有一个小组一天最多伐了二百四十棵树。在这一冬中，共有一百三十个队员学会了伐木，五十三个队员学会了饲养马的方法，七十二个队员掌握了熟练的赶车技术。
    荒地上严酷的寒冬对所有的队员都是一个考验。十一月间，大雪就掩盖住了广阔的草原。为了准备建设农庄用的木料，垦荒队的采伐队经当地政府批准走进了小兴安岭的森林。九十多人住在雪地上支起的帆布帐篷和临时搭成的草棚里，虽然升了几个大火炉，帐篷里的温度始终在零度以下。早晨起床的时候，被头上都结了一层白霜。可是谁也不肯退缩，当他们抡着斧头拉着大锯伐树的时候，就完全忘掉了寒冷，许多人脱掉了棉衣，身上还冒汗。在深山密林这种艰苦的环境里，小伙子们仍然为自己安排有趣的生活秩序。宿营地经常出版墙报，表扬优秀的队员，鼓励表现较差的伙伴。帐篷旁边修建了一个球场，每天早晨跑完步就打球。晚间在帐篷里围着火炉，唱自己编的歌或是开会交流生产经验。他们在规定的时间里超额完成了采伐任务。运输队同样是风雪不误地出动。去年十二月十六日，运输队八辆大车十七个队员在到萝北镇运物资的途中突然遇到寒流，气温降到零下三十九度，西北风像针似的扎着人的脸，但是他们没有一个人退缩，一面互相鼓励着，一面高声唱着顺口编出来的歌：“北大荒，好地方，几千年的荒野将要建起农庄……我们不想现在的寒冷，只想将来的美好景象……”在八点钟左右平安地到达了目的地。
    在建设祖国边疆这一豪迈的事业中，这些来自各方的垦荒队员们友爱地团结在一起。热爱集体的思想，在队员们中间已经一天比一天浓厚起来。十七岁的李老虎几个月前还是一个小学生。在山上六十天采伐期间，他不但没有歇过一次工，而且每天自动从山上背回一节木头，劈开烧火让队员们取暖。第四大队的女管理员邓桂英，因为经常关心别人，连许多岁数大的队员也叫她邓大姐。
    半年来，队员们已经深深地爱上了这里广阔肥美的土地。队员们还创作了几十首诗歌来歌颂“北大荒”。当地的居民们都说：“垦荒队员的乐事多，每逢劳动必唱歌。”
    现在，垦荒队员们正在筹备欢迎最近就要由北京、天津、河北等地来的一千七百多名新队员。在垦荒队员们建立的“青年屯”三里远的第十二号庄址，是今年青年垦区准备建立的十八个集体农庄之一，现在男女队员们正在紧张地搭盖供他们和很快就要来到的大批新伙伴们临时居住的草窝棚。春天一到，他们就要一起在五千多公顷新开垦的处女地上播种，并且进行十八个新村一千三百间房屋的建筑工程。明年，垦荒队员将要增加到六千人，开垦的荒地有两万多公顷，生产的粮食有几千万斤。垦荒队员们自豪地表示：他们一定要在不长的时间里，把青年垦区建设成一个稻谷丰盛的农业区，同时建立起自己幸福的家庭。
