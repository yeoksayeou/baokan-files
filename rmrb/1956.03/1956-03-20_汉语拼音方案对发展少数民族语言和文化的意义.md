    The Chinese Written Language Reform Committee has published the "Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme (Draft)," which is of great significance for strengthening the unity and development of our country in politics, economy, national defense, and culture. Such a phonetic alphabet scheme can not only be used to spell Mandarin Chinese, assist in teaching and promoting Mandarin Chinese, but also be used for various experiments in phonetic writing, so that Chinese phonetic writing can become a tool for communication among the people as soon as possible. It is of great significance not only for the Han nationality, which accounts for more than 90% of China's population, but also for the development of minority languages and cultures in our country.

    First, it can serve as the basis for minority nationalities to formulate phonetic alphabets. Many minority nationalities in our country do not yet have writing systems to represent their languages. They cannot find literate accountants in the current agricultural cooperativization movement. Some areas have already met the conditions for establishing production cooperatives in other respects, but due to the lack of literate people, they cannot be quickly organized, or if they are organized, they have to use some primitive methods to record events and accounts, which greatly affects work efficiency. Although ethnic schools have been gradually and widely established, there is a lack of textbooks written in their own languages. Some ethnic primary schools still have to teach through translation, which naturally affects the teaching effectiveness. Therefore, the need to create writing systems for minority nationalities is very urgent. The letter forms used by minority nationalities to create writing systems should be determined according to the wishes of the nationalities themselves. Now, many nationalities hope that their letter forms can be consistent with the Chinese phonetic alphabet. Because doing so has several advantages: first, it is convenient for minority nationalities and the Han nationality to learn each other's languages; second, it is convenient for minority languages and Chinese to enrich each other; third, if many minority nationalities adopt the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme as the basis for their alphabets, it will make the alphabet forms of many nationalities in our country the same, and each minority nationality will benefit from learning each other's languages and enriching each other's languages. At the ethnic language science discussion meeting held in Beijing last December, the representative of the Yi nationality in Sichuan said: "When will the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme be released? Although we are already eager to determine the new Yi language scheme, we also very much hope that the phonetic writing of our Yi nationality can be consistent with the letter forms of the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme. If the Chinese phonetic alphabet can be made within a few months, we can wait a little longer." The newly formulated Zhuang language scheme has been published in the Guangxi Daily and is widely soliciting opinions. In this scheme, p, t, and k are used to represent unaspirated voiceless stops, and b, d (Zhuang language does not have "g") are used to represent unaspirated voiced stops. When the Zhuang Language Research Guidance Committee of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture learned that the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme used b, d, and g to represent unaspirated voiceless stops, and P, t, and k to represent aspirated voiceless stops, they then changed the original scheme to be consistent with the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme. These examples fully illustrate how eagerly minority nationalities in the process of creating writing systems hope that their writing systems can be consistent with the letter forms of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme. We believe that unless there are special reasons for adopting other letter forms, minority nationalities should adopt the Chinese phonetic alphabet as the basis for creating writing systems, and then adapt it according to the characteristics of their own languages. This is in line with the interests of all nationalities and the overall interests of the motherland.

    Second, it can more effectively help minority nationalities learn Chinese and help the Han nationality learn minority languages. According to the reflections of comrades of various fraternal nationalities, whether they originally had writing systems or not, they all hope to learn Chinese well so as to learn advanced scientific knowledge faster and more widely. However, minority nationalities currently have great difficulties in learning Chinese because they lack tools for learning Chinese, and Chinese characters themselves are difficult to learn, so learning Chinese through them naturally takes a long time. Fraternal nationalities even complain that Han language workers have not actively come up with more effective ways to help them learn Chinese. Now that there is the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, there is a good way. We can use the phonetic alphabet scheme to write Mandarin textbooks and compile many Chinese textbooks, reference books, and dictionaries that are convenient for minority nationalities to use. At the same time, we should also use the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme to translate policy documents and compile and print newspapers, periodicals, and general reading materials. In this way, even if they cannot learn complicated Chinese characters for a while, they can quickly understand books and newspapers written in Chinese. In the near future, Mandarin Chinese will not only play a unifying role for different dialects in the Han areas but can also play the role of a lingua franca among all nationalities in our country. As mentioned earlier, the creation of alphabets by minority nationalities on the basis of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is conducive to the mutual learning of languages. Han cadres and troops working in various minority areas are already working hard to learn the local languages. In the future, it will naturally be much easier to learn the minority languages ​​whose alphabet forms are consistent with the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme. The Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme spells out a "phoneme-based" writing system. When the Han nationality masters the alphabet for spelling with "phonemes," even in areas where the writing system is not consistent with the letter forms of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, they can improve the efficiency of learning the local minority languages. In this way, they can help minority nationalities develop cultural education and other construction undertakings faster and more deeply. The development of minority languages ​​and the mutual learning of languages ​​among nationalities are not contradictory but complementary. Doing so can not only promote the development of languages ​​of all nationalities but also gradually eliminate the language barriers among nationalities. We believe that in the near future, there will be unprecedented rapid development and prosperity of languages, writing systems, cultural education of all nationalities in our country, making it more convenient for people of all nationalities to jointly build a socialist society.

    From the above, the publication of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is a great joy for the Han nationality and also a great joy for the fraternal nationalities. When formulating this phonetic alphabet scheme, the situation of fraternal nationalities' languages ​​was also taken into consideration. It is hoped that all fraternal nationalities will actively participate in the discussion and put forward their opinions, so as to promote the promulgation and use of this scheme as soon as possible after making necessary modifications. Under a unified new plan, language workers of all minority nationalities in the country are about to fully launch the work of helping minority nationalities create writing systems. The early determination of this phonetic alphabet scheme is of decisive significance for accelerating the progress and completion of the work of creating writing systems for many nationalities.

    汉语拼音方案对发展少数民族语言和文化的意义
    中国科学院语言研究所研究员  傅懋勣
    中国文字改革委员会发表了“汉语拼音方案（草案），这对于加强我国在政治、经济、国防、文化各方面的统一和发展，是具有重大意义的。这样一个拼音方案不只可以用来拼写汉语普通话，帮助教学和推广普通话，也可以用来进行拼音文字的各项试验，使汉语拼音文字早日成为人民群众交际的工具。它不只对于占我国人口90％以上的汉族，而且对于我国少数民族语言和文化的发展，也有很重大的意义。
    第一，它可以作为少数民族制定拼音字母的基础。我国现在有许多少数民族还没有代表自己语言的文字。他们目前在农业合作化运动中找不到懂文字的会计员，有些地区在其他方面已经具奋了建立生产合作社的条件，但是由于没有懂文字的人，还不能迅速地组织起来，或组织起来了不得不使用一些原始的办法记事记账，工作效率受到很大的影响。虽然民族学校已经在逐渐广泛地建立起来，但是缺乏用自己语言文字编写的课本，有些民族小学还要通过翻译上课，自然不能不影响教学效果。因此，为少数民族创立文字的需要非常迫切。少数民族创立文字使用的字母形式应该依照民族自愿来决定。现在许多民族都盼望他们的字母形式能和汉语拼音字母一致。因为这样做有几种便利：第一，便于少数民族和汉族互相学习语文；第二，便于少数民族语言和汉语互相丰富；第三，许多少数民族都采用汉语拼音方案作字母基础，就会使我国许多民族的字母形式相同，各少数民族中间也就得到互相学习语文、互相丰富语言的好处。去年十二月在北京举行民族语文科学讨论会的时候，四川彝族代表说：“汉语拼音方案究竟什么时候做出来？我们对新彝文方案的确定，虽然已经是迫不及待了，但是我们也非常希望我们彝族的拼音文字能和汉语拼音方案的字母形式一致。如果汉语拼音字母能在几个月以内做出，我们还可以等一下。”新制定的僮文方案已经在广西日报上发表，并广泛征求意见。在这个方案中是用p、t、k代表不送气的清塞音，用b、d（僮语没有「g」）代表不送气的浊塞音。当桂西僮族自治州僮族文字研究指导委员会知道了汉语拼音方案是用b、d、g代表不送气的清塞音，用P、t、k代表送气的清塞音以后，接着就把原方案改得和汉语拼音方案一致了。这些事例，可以充分说明在创立文字中的少数民族，是怎样热切地盼望着自己的文字能和汉语拼音方案的字母形式取得一致。我们认为：除非有采用别的字母形式的特殊原因，少数民族创立文字应该采用汉语拼音字母作基础，再根据自己语言的特点加以适应，这样，既符合各民族的利益，也符合祖国整体的利益。
    第二，它可以更有效地帮助少数民族学习汉语。帮助汉族学习少数民族语文。根据各兄弟民族同志的反映，不论原来有文字或没有文字的民族都很盼望学好汉语，以便更快、更广泛地学习先进的科学知识。但是少数民族目前学习汉语的困难很大；因为缺少学习汉语的工具，汉字本身难学，通过它学习汉语自然需要很长的时间。兄弟民族甚至埋怨汉族语文工作者没积极想出更有效的办法来帮助他们学习汉语。现在有了汉语拼音方案，就有好办法了。我们可以用拼音方案写成普通话课本并且编写许多便利少数民族使用的汉语课本、参考书和词典。同时，还应该用汉语拼音方案翻译政策文件，编印报纸刊物和一般读物。这样，他们即使一时学不会繁难的汉文，也能很快地看懂用汉语写的书报。在不久的将来，汉语普通话不只对汉族地区的不同方言可起统一的作用，并且可以在我国各民族中间发挥交际语的作用。前面已经说过，少数民族在汉语拼音方案的基础上创立字母有利于语文的互相学习。在各少数民族地区工作的汉族干部和部队已经在努力学习着当地民族的语言。将来学习和汉语拼音方案字母形式一致的少数民族文字，自然就容易多了。汉语拼音方案所拼写出来的是“音素化”的文字，当汉族掌握了使用“音素”拼音的字母以后，即使在使用不和汉语拼音方案字母形式一致的文字的地区，也能够提高学习当地民族语文的效率，这样他们就能更快更深入地帮助少数民族发展文化教育及其他各项建设事业。发展少数民族语文和各民族语文的互相学习不但没有矛盾，而且是相辅而行的。这样做既可以促进各民族语言的发展，又可以逐渐消除各民族中间在语言上的隔阂。我们相信，不久就会造成我国各民族语言文字和文化教育空前的迅速的发展和繁荣，使全国各族人民更便利地共同建设社会主义社会。
    由上看来，汉语拼音方案的发表，是汉族的一件大喜事，也是兄弟民族的一件大喜事。在制定这个拼音方案的时候，也曾经考虑到兄弟民族语言的情况。希望各兄弟民族热烈地参加讨论并提出意见，促使这个方案在做了必要的修改以后，最近就公布使用。全国少数民族语文工作者在统一的新规划下，即将全面展开帮助少数民族创立文字的工作。这个拼音方案的早日确定，对于许多民族创立文字工作的加速进行和完成是有决定意义的。
