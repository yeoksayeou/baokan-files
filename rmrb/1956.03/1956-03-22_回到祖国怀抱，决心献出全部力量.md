    Returning to the Embrace of the Motherland, Determined to Dedicate All My Strength
    Liu Erxiong, Engineer of the First Tractor Factory
    Not long ago, I returned to the motherland from the United States. In the past, due to the unreasonable detention by the U.S. government, I was unable to return for a long time. Since the start of the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks, after our government conducted resolute diplomatic struggles, and under the pressure of international public opinion, the U.S. government had no choice but to release a group of Chinese students studying in the U.S., giving me the opportunity to return to the motherland. I sincerely thank the government and the Party for their concern for Chinese students studying in the U.S.
    From 1951 onwards, the U.S. government adopted various unreasonable means of persecution against Chinese students, announcing the prohibition of departure and the dissolution of legitimate Chinese student organizations. The U.S. Immigration Bureau even warned Chinese students that if they attempted to leave the country, they would be subject to a fine of five thousand U.S. dollars and a five-year prison “sentence.” At the same time, the U.S. government treated Chinese students like criminals. We were all summoned to the Immigration Bureau for three to four hours of questioning, demanding that we express our personal thoughts and attitudes, forcing us to fingerprint, and stipulating that we must report our situation to the Immigration Bureau every month thereafter. Agents of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation also secretly monitored our daily actions, and we were subject to being called in for questioning at any time. As for communicating with the motherland, it was even more strictly censored. We often did not receive a letter from the motherland for two or three years, severing our connection with the motherland and our families. Therefore, our mental suffering was indescribable.
    In the early stages of the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks in Geneva in 1955, the U.S. government adopted new despicable means to persecute Chinese students. The Immigration Bureau arrested a group of Chinese students under the pretext of "expired passports," forcing them to pay a deposit of five hundred to one thousand U.S. dollars, and stipulating that their range of activities should not exceed a circle of fifty miles from the city center. They were also made to swear that they would not associate with anyone related to any Communist Party members. If they did not comply with these unreasonable regulations of the Immigration Bureau, they would be arrested and detained. At the same time, the Immigration Bureau tried every possible means to threaten and lure Chinese students to apply for U.S. citizenship under the so-called "Refugee Act," or forced them to obtain Taiwan entry permits, intending to permanently prevent Chinese students from returning to the motherland. After an agreement was reached in the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks on the issue of civilians returning to their respective countries, the U.S. government adopted delaying tactics, delaying the issuance of departure permits, and rigidly stipulating departure deadlines, or claiming that we owed income tax, deliberately creating various difficulties to obstruct Chinese students from returning to their country. As for myself, it took more than three months from applying for departure to getting approval. During this time, the U.S. Immigration Bureau repeatedly interrogated me.
    In the short two months since returning to the motherland, I have personally witnessed the rapid progress of the motherland's socialist construction, the improvement of the lives of the broad masses of the people, and everyone is filled with infinite hope and confidence in the future of the motherland. All this has made me deeply feel how glorious and happy it is to be a people of the new China.
    The government and the Party have shown me meticulous care, helping me understand the various aspects of the motherland's situation in recent years, and assigning me the glorious and important task of participating in the construction of factories. In the future, I am determined to constantly improve myself politically and professionally, and dedicate all my strength to serve the motherland and the people.

    回到祖国怀抱，决心献出全部力量
    第一拖拉机厂工程师　刘尔雄
    不久以前，我从美国回到了祖国。过去由于美国政府的无理扣留，使我长期不能回来。自中美大使级会谈开始后，经过我国政府进行坚决的外交斗争，并且在国际舆论压力下，美国政府才不得不放回一批中国留美学生，使我获得了回返祖国的机会。我衷心感谢政府和党对我国留美学生的关怀。
    从1951年起，美国政府对中国留学生就采取了种种无理的迫害手段，宣布禁止离境和解散合法的中国留学生组织。美国移民局并且警告中国留学生说：如果企图离境，便要受到罚款五千美元及坐监五年的“处分”。同时，美国政府对待中国留学生如同罪犯，我们都曾被召到移民局受三、四小时的盘问，要我们表明个人的思想及态度，强迫我们打手印，并且还规定以后每个月必须向移民局报告情况。美国联邦调查局的特务还暗中监视我们日常的行动，我们随时有被叫去盘问的可能。至于和祖国通信，更是受到严格检查，我们往往二、三年内收不到祖国的一封书信，使我们和祖国及家人断绝了联系，因此我们精神上的痛苦是难以形容的。
    1955年日内瓦中美大使级会谈初期，美国政府又采用新的卑鄙手段来迫害中国留学生。移民局以“护照过期”为名逮捕了一批中国留学生，强迫他们交保证金五百至一千美元，并规定行动范围不准离开市中心五十英里的圈子，还叫宣誓不得与任何共产党员有关系的人接近。如果不遵守移民局这些无理的规定，便要被逮捕和拘禁。同时，移民局又千方百计地威胁和引诱中国留学生根据所谓“难民法”申请美国籍，或者强迫领取台湾入境证，打算永久阻止中国留学生返回祖国。在中美大使级会谈关于双方平民回国问题达成协议后，美国政府又采取拖延态度，迟迟不发给离境证，并且硬性规定离境期限，或者说我们欠所得税，故意制造种种困难来阻挠中国留学生回国。以我自己来说，从申请出境到批准，共费了三个多月的时间，在这时间内，美国移民局还屡次对我进行盘问。
    回到祖国短短的两个月内，我亲眼看到了祖国社会主义建设一日千里地前进，广大人民的生活都提高了，人人对祖国前途充满了无限美好的希望和信心，这一切都使我深深的感到作一个新中国的人民是多么光荣、幸福。
    政府和党对我的关怀真是无微不至的，帮助我了解祖国近几年来各方面的情况，并且分配我参加建设工厂这一光荣而重大的任务，今后我决心在政治上和业务上不断提高自己，并且献出自己全部的力量，为祖国和为人民服务。
