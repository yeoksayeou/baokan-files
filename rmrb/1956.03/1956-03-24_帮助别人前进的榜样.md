    A Role Model for Helping Others Advance
    Dai Yue
    Since 1953, the Meng Zhaoming team at the Harbin Flax Textile Factory has been recognized as an advanced collective in the factory. In 1954 and 1955, it was consecutively awarded the title of Model Team of Harbin City. Meng Zhaoming has also continuously received the honorary title of Labor Model of the city.
    However, within this team, there was a worker named Ma Wanhe, who used to work in a private textile factory and possessed a set of skilled techniques. He was very satisfied when he came to the modern Harbin Flax Factory, but he was reluctant to abandon his old operating techniques. While working, as the machines ran, he leisurely wandered around, resulting in the highest yarn breakage rate on his machine, failure to meet production targets, and exceeding the raw yarn usage quota by 100%.
    To help Ma Wanhe improve his skills, Meng Zhaoming, at a team production meeting, asked everyone to learn and master the experience of Zhao Jiaxiang and Niu Wanhe, who were the best at using advanced Soviet operating methods. Ma Wanhe was also willing to learn, but he became discouraged before he became proficient and saw significant results. He said, "Everyone says I don't study, but now I'm studying, and I haven't improved!" He always thought the old methods were better. Meng Zhaoming then asked him to compete with Niu Wanhe, a fast weaver, and Niu Wanhe won. After Meng Zhaoming and Niu Wanhe patiently explained the superiority of advanced Soviet operating methods, Ma Wanhe was convinced. Soon, he mastered the advanced operating methods and gradually achieved comprehensive overfulfillment of various planned targets. He also became the top expert in removing second-class cloth in the entire workshop, with a work efficiency more than double that of others. His experience has been widely promoted throughout the weaving workshop, and he himself has been recognized as an advanced producer.
    Meng Zhaoming also helped others improve their ideological awareness. Worker Ji Xingbang was one of the more skilled workers in the team, but he always thought that working was just for earning money to eat, and he didn't care about anything else. He worked on a roving frame, where the roving breakage rate was relatively low and the work was easy. His technical skills were also high, so he effortlessly completed his tasks every month. Worker Zang Yancong worked on a spinning frame, where his technical skills were relatively low, the work was difficult, and the breakage rate was very high, so he failed to complete his tasks every month. In order to enable all workers in the team to reach an advanced level, Meng Zhaoming decided at a team meeting to switch Ji Xingbang and Zang Yancong's machines. Ji Xingbang disagreed, but he had to comply with the team's decision. From then on, he quarreled with the team leader. If there was a minor problem with the machine, he would call the team leader to fix it. Once, when the team leader was busy and couldn't come to fix it immediately, he threw down his tools, abandoned the machine, and left. Meng Zhaoming did not criticize him at the time, but repaired the machine himself and started it. He waited until Ji Xingbang was no longer angry before reasoning with him. At the team meeting, everyone helped him, and he finally changed. Last year, when he got married, the team workers helped him a lot, which moved him deeply. After his work attitude changed, he quickly became active. Now, he has also been recognized as an advanced producer in the entire factory.
    The story of the Meng Zhaoming team helping Ji Xingbang change greatly moved Wang Zhenmao, the leader of the neighboring team. Wang Zhenmao's technical skills were relatively high, but he believed that the team leader was just a flag-waver, and he didn't care about the fixed machines. He would go wherever there was a problem. If no one needed him, he would sit in the smoking room and smoke. Because he was not proactive in his work, workers had to stop their machines and look for him everywhere when there was a problem. Sometimes, when second-class cloth was produced, the workers couldn't distinguish whether it met the quality requirements, so they carelessly submitted it as finished products. When the inspectors found out, Wang Zhenmao would blame the workers. The workers did not accept his blame and did not listen to his instructions. This forced Wang Zhenmao to consider changing his work style. At this time, he noticed that Ji Xingbang of the Meng Zhaoming team was working very enthusiastically, so he went to Meng Zhaoming and asked how Ji Xingbang had changed. Meng Zhaoming took this opportunity to help Wang Zhenmao improve his team's work. From then on, Wang Zhenmao would ask Meng Zhaoming for help whenever he had a problem. Meng Zhaoming patiently provided assistance, which greatly moved Wang Zhenmao. From then on, he could no longer be found in the smoking room, and he no longer angrily blamed the workers. He quickly learned the advanced experience of the Meng Zhaoming team. One hour before work every day, he would arrange the work for every moment of the eight hours. Once he started working, he would constantly patrol the team, checking quality, repairing machines, and helping workers operate. The team leader's change in work style moved the workers. Team members who used to quarrel with Wang Zhenmao often now consulted with the team leader to solve problems. At the end of February this year, when advanced producers for 1955 were selected, this team was also recognized as one of the fourteen advanced teams in the entire factory.
    The Meng Zhaoming and Wang Zhenmao teams frequently exchange experiences and improve their work. The Wang Zhenmao team used shuttle belts more economically than the Meng Zhaoming team, so the Meng Zhaoming team workers actively learned from them. The Wang Zhenmao team also actively learned from the Meng Zhaoming team's experience in reducing waste yarn. These two teams are role models for mutual help and common progress throughout the factory.

    帮助别人前进的榜样

    哈尔滨亚麻纺织厂孟昭明小组从1953年就被评为厂的先进集体，1954年和1955年连续被评为哈尔滨市模范小组。孟昭明也连续获得了全市劳动模范的光荣称号。
    但是，在这个小组里，有一位工人马万和，过去在私人纺织厂作工，掌握了一套熟练的技术。他来到现代化的哈尔滨亚麻厂，很满意，可是舍不得丢掉旧的一套操作技术。在工作的时候，机器一转动，他就悠闲地到处观望，结果他的机台断头率最高，产量计划完不成，原纱用量也超过指标一倍。
    为了帮助马万和提高技术，孟昭明在一次小组生产会上，要求大家学习掌握苏联先进操作法最好的赵家祥、牛万和的经验。马万和也愿意学，但是，还没有熟练，看不出显著成绩就灰心了。他说：“都说我不学习，现在我学习了，也没提高哇！”他总认为老方法好。孟昭明又请他跟织布快手牛万和比赛，结果牛万和胜利了。经过孟昭明、牛万和耐心地介绍苏联先进操作法的优越性，马万和服气了。不久，他就掌握先进操作法，并逐渐做到全面地超额完成各项计划指标。他还是全车间拆次布的第一能手，工作效率比别人高了一倍多。他的经验已在全织布车间普遍推广，他自己也被评为先进生产者。
    孟昭明也帮助别人提高思想觉悟。工人姬兴邦，是小组里技术水平比较高的一个，可是他总以为干活是为了挣钱吃饭，别的事都不管。他在织粗纱的机台上干活，纱粗断头率比较低，活容易干，他的技术水平又高，因此每月不费劲地就完成了任务。工人臧延从在细纱机台上干活，技术水平比较低，活又不好干，断头率很高，每月都完不成任务。孟昭明为了使全组工人都能达到先进的水平，在小组会议上便决定姬兴邦和臧延从调换机台。姬兴邦不同意，但又不能不执行小组的决定。从此他就跟小组长闹别扭，机器出一点毛病，他就叫小组长来修。有一次小组长有事不能马上来修，他就把工具一摔，扔下机器走了。孟昭明当时没有批评他，把机器修理好，自己开起来，等他不生气的时候，才跟他讲道理。在小组会议上，大家都来帮助他，使他终于有了转变。在去年他结婚的时候，小组工人又给他帮了很大的忙，使他很受感动。他的工作态度转变后，很快积极起来。现在也被评为全厂的先进生产者。
    孟昭明小组帮助姬兴邦转变的事，大大感动了邻组组长王振茂。王振茂的技术水平比较高，但他认为组长是打小旗的，自己不管固定的机器，哪里有事到哪里，没人找，就坐在吸烟室里吸烟。由于他工作不主动，工人们有事要停下机器到处找他。有时候出了次布，工人辨别不出合不合乎质量要求，就马马虎虎地当作成品交，被检验员查出来了，王振茂就责备工人。工人们不接受他的责备，也不听他的指挥。逼得王振茂不得不考虑转变作风。正在这个时候，他发现孟昭明小组的姬兴邦干活挺起劲，于是他去找孟昭明，问姬兴邦是怎样转变的。孟昭明就趁这个机会帮助王振茂改进小组工作。从此，王振茂一有难题就找孟昭明。孟昭明都耐心的给予帮助，使王振茂很受感动。从此，在吸烟室里再也找不到他了，他也不气冲冲地乱责备工人了。他很快就学会了孟昭明小组的先进经验，每天上班前一小时，就把八小时的每时每刻的工作安排好，一上班就不停地在小组里巡回，检查质量、修理机器、帮助工人操作。小组长工作的转变，感动了工人们，过去经常跟王振茂吵嘴的组员，现在有问题也跟小组长商量着解决了。这个小组在今年二月末评选1955年先进生产者的时候，也被评为全厂十四个先进小组中的一个了。
    孟昭明和王振茂两个小组经常互相交流经验，改进工作。王振茂小组使用打梭带比孟昭明小组节省，孟昭明小组工人就积极向他们学习。王振茂小组也积极学习孟昭明小组的减少废纱的经验。这两个小组是全厂互相帮助，共同前进的榜样。
