The Lesson of 130,000 Bolts of Substandard Cloth
By Our Correspondent Qin Junguang

From the beginning of 1954 to the second half of 1955, the Yunnan Provincial State-Owned Yunnan Dyeing and Weaving Factory dyed more than 452,000 bolts of various colored cloths, completing its production plan every month. But what kind of colored cloths were they producing? The cloth was thin, the color was light, the red cloth was not red, the blue cloth was not blue, the black cloth was not black, the color of the cloth was uneven, the sizes were inconsistent, and the width was not uniform. According to their own standards (which were lower than the standards set by the Ministry of Textile Industry and were implemented privately without the approval of the Provincial Department of Industry), more than 137,000 bolts out of the 450,000 bolts of colored cloth were substandard, accounting for more than 30% of the total product.

How did so many substandard cloths come about? This was mainly because the leaders of the Yunnan Dyeing and Weaving Factory were infected with serious capitalist management ideas. In order to obtain the glorious title of "over-fulfilling the production plan" and to obtain more odd-length cloth and over-fulfill the profit remittance, they stretched, widened, and further stretched the cloth. They gained more than 150,000 yuan worth of odd-length cloth by this means. Because of this 150,000 yuan, the state suffered a total economic loss of more than 822,000 yuan, and suffered irreparable losses politically.

The workers of the Yunnan Dyeing and Weaving Factory were very dissatisfied with the leadership's practice of falsification and deception of consumers. They had made many correct suggestions for improving the quality of printing and dyeing. But none of them were adopted. The Party organization of the Dyeing and Weaving Factory also failed to adhere to principles and actively lead the broad masses of workers in a struggle against the capitalist management ideas that ignored product quality and falsified information. When some Party members or the masses reported the leadership's fraudulent behavior to the Party organization, the Party organization not only did not support them, but instead questioned whether those who made suggestions had worked in accordance with the operating procedures.

The Yunnan Provincial Department of Industry, which directly led the factory, also failed to fulfill its responsibilities. The Yunnan Dyeing and Weaving Factory did not implement the "Draft Standards for Finished Cotton Fabric Printing and Dyeing" promulgated by the Ministry of Textile Industry, but instead set its own standards that were lower than the inspection standards stipulated in the draft. The Department of Industry did not investigate or correct this. The Department of Industry also lacked inspection of the factory's production situation and was satisfied with the factory's report of "completing the plan every month."

The Yunnan Dyeing and Weaving Factory has always been processing for the Yunnan Provincial Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company. However, the Yunnan Provincial Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company never signed a processing contract with the factory and accepted the products without inspection. In particular, the Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company actually agreed that the Yunnan Dyeing and Weaving Factory could stretch the cloth by 5.5%, with the extra odd-length cloth belonging to the factory. When the low-quality colored cloth was criticized by consumers and could not be sold, they did not raise any objections until the substandard cloth accumulated more and more in the warehouse, causing them to fail to complete their sales plan, before they requested the relevant leading organs to correct the errors of the Yunnan Dyeing and Weaving Factory.

Now, the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the relevant leading organs have successively sent people to the Yunnan Dyeing and Weaving Factory to conduct inspections, and will give appropriate treatment to the relevant derelict personnel. We should learn a lesson from this incident: Leading organs must regularly check the production of their subordinate enterprises, discover their good experiences in a timely manner, summarize and promote them; and their errors and shortcomings should be corrected quickly. If one is satisfied with the reports and statements of enterprises, it is impossible to lead the enterprises well.

    13万匹次布的教训
    本报记者　秦军光
    云南省地方国营云南漂染厂，从1954年初到1955年下半年，共染出各种色布452，000多匹，逐月完成了产量计划。可是他们生产的是一些什么样的色布呢？布薄、色浅，红布不红，蓝布不蓝，黑布不黑，布色不匀，尺码不一，幅宽不齐；根据他们自己所订的低于纺织工业部所订的指标（未经省工业厅批准，私自执行），在45万多匹色布中，次品就达137，000多匹，占产品总量的30％以上。
    这么多的次布是怎样来的呢？主要是由于云南漂染厂的领导人员沾染了严重的资本主义经营思想。他们为了获得“超额完成生产计划”的光荣称号，为了获得更多的零码布和超额完成上缴利润，竟把布拉长、拉宽，再拉长。他们用这种手段多得的零码布，价值达15万多元。就因为这15万多元，使国家在经济上共损失822，000多元，并且在政治上遭受了无法挽回的损失。
    云南漂染厂的职工们，对于领导上这种弄虚作假，欺骗消费者的做法是非常不满意的。他们曾提过很多有关改进印染质量的正确建议。但是都没有被采纳。漂染厂的党组织也没有坚持原则，积极领导广大职工同忽视产品质量、弄虚作假的资本主义经营思想展开斗争。有的党员或群众向党组织揭发领导上弄虚作假的行为的时候，党组织不但不予支持，反而质问提意见的人是否按照操作规程工作了？
    直接领导这个厂的云南省工业厅也没有尽到自己的责任。云南漂染厂不执行纺织工业部颁发的“棉织品印染成品标准草案”，而自己订了标准低于这个草案规定的检验标准，工业厅不追查，也不纠正。工业厅对这个厂的生产情况，也缺乏检查，满足于这个厂“逐月完成计划”的报告。
    云南漂染厂一向都是替云南省花纱布公司加工。但是，云南省花纱布公司从来没有同这个厂订立加工合同，产品不经检验就接收。尤其错误的是，花纱布公司竟同意云南漂染厂把布拉长5.5％，多出来的零码布归工厂所有；质量低劣的色布已经受到消费者批评，卖不出去的时候，他们还不提出意见，直到仓库里积压的次布越积越多，使他们完不成销售计划的时候，才请求有关领导机关纠正云南漂染厂的错误。
    现在，中共云南省委会和有关的领导机关已经先后派人到云南漂染厂去检查，将给有关的失职人员以适当的处理。我们应该从这一件事中吸取教训：领导机关必须经常检查所属企业的生产情况，及时发现它们的好经验，加以总结和推广；对它们的错误和缺点，则应该迅速纠正。如果满足于企业的报告、报表，是不会把企业领导好的。
