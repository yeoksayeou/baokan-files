    State-Run Huayanghe Farm Commences Production
    The lakeside area of Susong and Wangjiang counties in the Huayanghe River basin of Anhui Province has recently established a large-scale mechanized farm—the State-Run Huayanghe Farm. Preparations for the establishment of this farm began in November 1955. At present, the basic construction projects such as the machinery depot, offices, and staff dormitories have been largely completed. Agricultural machinery such as tractors, seeders, cultivators, and five-furrow plows have also been mostly delivered. This spring, the farm plans to reclaim 14,000 mu of wasteland and sow crops such as corn, rice, soybeans, sorghum, and cotton. By the end of this year, the farm will have reclaimed 80,000 mu, of which 40,000 mu will be sown with winter wheat. (Zhou Xuezheng)

    国营华阳河农场投入生产
    安徽省华阳河流域的宿松、望江两县的滨湖地区，最近建立了一所大型的机械农场——国营华阳河农场。这个农场是在1955年11月开始筹备建立的。目前，机具库、办公室和职工宿舍等基本建设工程已经基本完成。拖拉机、播种机、中耕机和五铧犁等农业机械也已大部运到。今年春季，农场计划开荒14，000亩，播种玉米、水稻、大豆、高粱和棉花等作物。到今年年底以前，农场将开荒8万亩，其中4万亩将播种冬小麦。（周学铮）
