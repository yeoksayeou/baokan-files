    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 26th. The officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army continue to support the socialist construction of the motherland with various practical actions.
    After studying the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) for 1956 to 1967, the officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army formulated specific action plans for their units or individuals. Some decided to write at least one letter a month to their family members and relatives to encourage them to contribute more to socialist construction. Some units proposed that each person donate three books to send to agricultural producers' cooperatives in the motherland, so that the members could improve their cultural level. Encouraged by the high tide of socialist construction in the motherland, the officers and soldiers of an engineering company of a certain unit studied even more actively. One squad achieved 100% of the predetermined requirements in a recent shooting test, and half of the squad members were rewarded for their excellent performance.

    中国人民志愿军官兵支援祖国社会主义建设
    据新华社平壤26日电　中国人民志愿军官兵继续以各种实际行动支援祖国社会主义建设。
    志愿军某部官兵在学习了1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）以后，纷纷订出了本单位或个人的具体行动计划。有的人订出每月至少给自己的家属、亲友写一封信鼓励他们更好地在社会主义建设中贡献力量。有的单位倡议每人捐献三本书，寄给祖国的农业生产合作社，让社员们提高文化。某部工兵连的官兵在祖国社会主义建设高潮的鼓舞下，更加积极地学习，有一班在最近一次射击测验中，百分之百地达到了预定要求，全班有一半人因为成绩优秀得到奖励。
