Xinhua News Agency, London: On March 7th, the British House of Commons held a noisy debate on the government's Middle East policy. According to foreign news agencies, the debate took place amidst the "tense anticipation" of members of Parliament for Eden to deliver an "important policy statement." A group of far-right conservatives were agitating for "using a show of military force against Jordan and Egypt to salvage British prestige in the Middle East." Other members, mainly from the opposition party, demanded that the government re-examine its Middle East policy.

Eden spoke during the debate. His speech received what Reuters called "stormy" criticism, and was "met with heckling from the opposition" from the start. This was because Eden could not actually propose any feasible solutions. Besides reiterating that he would adhere to the Baghdad Pact, he had to admit that he could not yet "announce an immediately adoptable policy or an inevitable course of action" regarding Jordan. Eden had to force a vote of confidence in the House of Commons to demonstrate support for his policy.

On March 8th, Eden convened an emergency cabinet meeting, attempting to find new ways to cope with the Middle East situation. This was the fourth emergency cabinet meeting held by the British cabinet since the Glubb affair. In addition, news reports stated that representatives from the United States, Britain, and France discussed the Middle East situation in Washington on March 6th, and the possibility of taking joint action under the pretext of "guaranteeing" "peace" in the region.

A United Press International dispatch stated that the British government had already raised a request with the United States during consultations for the United States to "immediately" join the Baghdad Pact. The British government wanted to rely on the power of the United States to help maintain British rule in the Middle East. According to British newspaper reports in recent days, the U.S. and British Mediterranean fleets have been ordered to strengthen patrols along the eastern Mediterranean coast. There are also reports that the United States and Britain intend to send more troops to the region.

### 英国下院和内阁连续对中东政策进行紧张的讨论

    英国下院和内阁连续对中东政策进行紧张的讨论
    据新华社讯　伦敦消息：3月7日，英国下院在吵吵闹闹之中对政府的中东政策进行了辩论。据外国通讯社的消息说，这次辩论是在议员们“紧张地等待”艾登发表“重要政策声明”的心情下举行的。有一批保守党的极右翼分子正在鼓动用“对约旦和埃及显示军事力量的办法来挽救英国在中东的威望”。另外有些议员，主要是反对党的议员则要求政府重新审查它的中东政策。
    艾登在辩论中发了言。他的讲话受到了路透社称之为“暴风雨般的”批评，而且从一开始就“受到反对党的吵闹的对待”。这是因为艾登实际上提不出什么可行的办法。他除了重申他将坚持巴格达条约外，不能不承认他还不能对约旦“宣布一个立即采行的政策或者不可避免地将要遵循的政策路线”。艾登只好迫使下院举行了一次信任投票，来表示对他的政策的支持。
    3月8日艾登召开了内阁紧急会议，企图寻找应付中东局势的新办法。这已经是格拉布事件发生以后英国内阁举行的第四次紧急会议了。另外有消息说，美、英、法三国的代表3月6日在华盛顿讨论了中东局势和在“保证”这个地区的“和平”的借口下采取共同行动的问题。
    合众社的一条消息说，英国政府已经在同美国会商中提出了请美国“立即”加入巴格达条约的要求。英国政府想依靠美国的力量来帮助维持英国在中东的统治。据最近几天的英国报纸报道，美国和英国的地中海舰队已经奉命加强地中海东岸的巡逻。还有消息说，美国和英国打算向这个地区增派军队。
