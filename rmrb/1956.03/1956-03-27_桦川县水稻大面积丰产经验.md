Experiences of Large-Scale High Yields of Rice in Huachuan County
Shen Changchun, Deputy Secretary of the Huachuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

The rice in Huachuan County, Heilongjiang Province, has achieved high yields year after year in recent years. In 1953, the average rice yield per hectare in the county's more than 2,500 hectares of paddy fields was 8,000 jin. In 1954, the average rice yield per hectare in the county's 3,000 hectares of paddy fields was 9,300 jin. Last year, the county's paddy fields increased to 4,600 hectares, with an average rice yield of 8,000 jin per hectare. The reason for the decrease in yield last year compared to the previous year was mainly that the technological reform work did not keep up, in addition to the impact of natural disasters.

Huachuan County is located on the south bank of the Songhua River and is rich in water resources. There are 38 rivers of various sizes in the county, which can irrigate 50,000 hectares of paddy fields. The soil in the paddy field area is fertile and the terrain is flat. The farmers call this area the "rich granary." However, before liberation, the average rice yield per hectare on this fertile land was less than 3,500 jin. In recent years, a large number of agricultural production cooperatives have been developed, and scientific agricultural technologies have been adopted, resulting in large-scale high yields. The main technical experiences for high yields are:

I. Deep plowing, fine harrowing, and leveling the land. In the past, the depth of plowing was generally 7 cm, and at most 10 cm. The quality of harrowing was rough, and the ground was uneven, resulting in uneven irrigation depth, serious lack of seedlings and broken rows, and uneven density of seedlings. In 1953, the cultivation method of "deep plowing, fine harrowing, and leveling the ground" was adopted. The specific operation process is: after deep plowing with a double-wheel single-blade plow or tractor (the depth is generally 18 cm to 20 cm, increasing by 1 cm to 1.5 cm each year compared to the previous year), harrow three to four times with a disc harrow, and then harrow once with a tine harrow. In 1953, the Xinghuo Agricultural Production Cooperative promoted this advanced experience on 210 hectares of paddy fields in the whole cooperative, generally achieving reasonable irrigation, with a water level difference of less than 5 cm, and the rice seedlings grew well.

II. Using mechanical dry sowing and reasonable close planting. In the past, farmers used to flood the fields first and then sow seeds manually. This method has many disadvantages: (1) Because the ground cannot be seen when working in the water, the quality of sowing cannot be guaranteed. (2) Timely sowing cannot be achieved. Because the irrigation time for the upper and lower sections of the land is different, the sowing time is also different. The agricultural cooperative led by Qiu Shaoyun had a difference of half a month to twenty days in the sowing time between the upper and lower sections of its 300 hectares of paddy fields. Rice sown late has a short maturity period and is often damaged by frost, resulting in a yield reduction of 20% to 30%. Especially in years of spring drought, due to the small amount of water, farmers cultivating the upper and lower sections of the land often have water disputes in order to be the first to sow. (3) The weather in Heilongjiang is cold, and farmers are prone to illness when working in cold water in the spring. After the mechanical dry sowing method was promoted in 1953, the above problems were solved, and reasonable close planting was also implemented. In areas where dry direct seeding is used, the amount of seeds sown per hectare is generally increased by about 200 jin to 250 jin compared to the past; the number of rice seedlings reaches 5.5 million to 6 million, an increase of more than 2 million compared to the past; and a large number of female laborers are absorbed to participate in production. In the past, only a few women participated in labor in the spring operations of Hongguang and other cooperatives, but now 90% of the women go to the fields and work the same as men.

III. Reasonable fertilization. After adopting flat sowing and close planting, if the fertilizer is insufficient, not only will the yield not increase, but it will also decrease. Therefore, it is necessary to implement reasonable fertilization to increase the quantity and quality of manure. In 1954, the Liaoyuan Cooperative planted more than 200 hectares of rice, applying an average of 120,000 jin of base fertilizer per hectare, of which more than 80 hectares of land used granular fertilizer. As a result, the closely planted rice seedlings grew more than five inches taller than in the past, and the rice ears were also larger, with an average increase of 1,500 jin of rice per hectare.

IV. Promoting improved varieties according to local conditions. In the past, many villages did not pay attention to promoting improved varieties of rice. Many cooperatives simply did not have seed collection fields, and only left some of the better rice during the autumn harvest as seeds, making it difficult to ensure the purity of the seeds. In 1953, efforts were made to promote the establishment of seed collection fields, and specialized technicians were assigned to manage the seed collection fields. Some agricultural cooperatives also established seed experimental fields to cultivate improved varieties. The Xinghuo Cooperative used its own seed experimental field to test and research six improved varieties, including "Shishou Baimao," which are suitable for the local climate conditions. This variety was widely promoted in the county's more than 3,000 hectares of paddy fields, resulting in an average yield increase of 15% per hectare compared to ordinary varieties.

The above are the main technical experiences for obtaining large-scale high yields of rice. In 1955, many cooperatives in Huachuan County did not adopt the mechanical dry direct seeding method and still used the manual broadcasting method; in some places where it was adopted, some cooperatives did not do a good job of harrowing and leveling the land, and the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken rows was still serious; in particular, cooperatives throughout the county generally neglected seed storage work, resulting in a decrease in yield compared to 1954.

Although Huachuan County's paddy fields have achieved high yields over the years, there is still great potential. This year, the county's more than 7,500 hectares of paddy fields will universally promote the above-mentioned yield-increasing experiences, so that the yield per hectare of paddy fields may exceed 10,000 jin. In order to achieve this task, in addition to summarizing the rice yield-increasing experience and issuing it to various advanced cooperatives for study, the Huachuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has also held training classes for paddy field technical cadres in district units, and has also helped various advanced cooperatives formulate rice cultivation methods. At the same time, the Huachuan County Committee has decided to designate March as the agricultural technology publicity month, organize a large army of technical propaganda, and launch a large-scale technical reform propaganda movement to the vast number of members, handing over advanced yield-increasing experiences to the masses.

    桦川县水稻大面积丰产经验
    中共桦川县委副书记　申昌淳
    黑龙江省桦川县的水稻，几年来年年获得高额产量。1953年全县二千五百多公顷水田每公顷平均产稻八千斤。1954年全县三千公顷水田，每公顷平均产稻九千三百斤。去年全县水田发展到四千六百公顷，每公顷平均产稻八千斤，去年的产量比前一年下降的原因，除了自然灾害的影响以外，主要是技术改革工作没有赶上去。
    桦川县位于松花江南岸，水利资源很丰富。县内共有大小河流三十八条，能灌溉五万公顷水田。水田地区土质肥沃，地势平坦，农民把这个地区叫做“富饶的粮仓”。可是解放前在这个肥沃的土地上，每公顷水稻产量平均还不到三千五百斤。最近几年来大量发展了农业生产合作社，采用了科学的农业技术，才获得了大面积丰产。丰产的主要技术经验是：
    一、深耕细耙、整平土地。过去翻地深度一般是七公分，最多至十公分。整地耙地质量粗糙，地面高低不平，灌水深度也高低不平，缺苗断条、苗稀稠不匀的现象很严重。 1953年开始采用“深耕细耙、整平地面”的耕作法，具体操作过程是：用双轮一铧犁或拖拉机深翻之后（深度一般的十八公分至二十公分。每年比上一年加深一公分至一公分半），用圆盘耙耙三遍到四遍，然后再用钉齿耙耙一遍。星火农业生产合作社1953年在全社210公顷水田上推广了这个先进经验，一般的都作到合理灌溉，水位深浅差度不到五公分，稻苗生长良好。
    二、采用机械干播、合理密植。过去农民都是先放水，后用人工播种。这个办法有很多缺点：（1）因为在水里作业看不到地面，不能保证播种质量。（2）不能作到适时播种。因为上段地和下段地灌水时间不一样，播种时间也就不一样。丘少云领导的农业合作社三百公顷水田，上段地和下段地播种时间相差半个月到二十天。晚播的稻子成熟期短，常常遭受霜灾，减产20％到30％。特别是在春旱的年份，由于水量少，耕种上、下段地的农民为了抢先播种，常常发生争水矛盾。（3）黑龙江天气冷，农民春天在冷水里作业，容易得病。1953年开始推广了机械干播方法以后，解决了上述问题，同时还实行了合理密植。采用干直播的地方，每公顷播种量一般的比过去增加了二百斤到二百五十斤左右；稻苗棵数达到五百五十万棵到六百万棵，比过去增加了二百万棵以上；并且吸收大量妇女劳动力参加了生产。红光等社过去在春季作业中，只有少数妇女参加劳动，现在已有90％的妇女下地和男人同样作活。
    三、合理施肥。采用平播密植以后，如果肥料不足，不但不能增产，而且还要减产。因此必须实行合理施肥，提高粪肥数量和质量。燎原社1954年种二百多公顷水稻，每公顷平均上了基肥十二万斤，其中八十多公顷土地使用了颗粒肥料，因此密植的稻苗比过去多长了五寸以上，稻穗也大，每公顷平均增产稻谷一千五百斤。
    四、因地制宜地推广优良品种。过去很多村都没有注意推广水稻优良品种。有很多社根本就没有采种田，只是在秋收的时候留出一部分较好的稻子作为种籽，这样就很难保证种籽纯净。1953年大力提倡设立采种田，并且配备了专门技术人员管理采种田。有些农业合作社还建立了种籽试验地培植优良品种。星火社用本社种籽试验地，试验研究出“石守白毛”等六种适合本地区气候条件的优良品种。全县三千多公顷水田里普遍推广了这个品种，结果比一般的品种每公顷平均增产15％的产量。
    上述几点就是获得水稻大面积丰产的主要技术经验。1955年桦川县有不少的合作社由于没有采用机械干直播法，仍然采用人工撒播法；已经采用的地方有些社耙地整地不好，缺苗断条现象仍然严重；特别是全县合作社较普遍地忽视了种籽保管工作，因而产量比1954年减少。
    桦川县水田历年虽然获得了高额产量，但是还有很大的潜力。今年全县七千五百多公顷水田将普遍推广上述增产经验，这样每公顷水田产量可能超过一万斤。为了实现这个任务，目前中共桦川县委除了把水稻增产经验总结出来，印发到各个高级社学习以外，并且以区为单位召开了水田技术干部训练班，还帮助各高级社制定了水稻栽培办法。同时，桦川县委已经决定把三月份作为农业技术宣传月，组织技术宣传大军，向广大社员开展一个规模巨大的技术改革宣传运动，把先进增产经验交给广大群众。
