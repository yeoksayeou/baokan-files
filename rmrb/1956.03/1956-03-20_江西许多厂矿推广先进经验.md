Many factories and mines in Jiangxi Province are widely promoting advanced experiences in the socialist competition. After the Pingxiang Coal Mine's Wangjiayuan Mine promoted more than ten advanced experiences this year, such as the one-team coal mining system and the multi-machine operation of electric chutes, production efficiency increased by 10% to 40% respectively. The Ganzhou Power Plant promoted the advanced experience of using furnace tube heat recovery to increase air temperature, which can save more than 25,000 yuan per year.

The promotion of advanced experience has greatly helped workers break through the current quotas. The new quotas announced in January this year by Gaokeng Mine and Wangjiayuan Mine of Pingxiang Mining Bureau were 17% higher than last year's quotas on average, but were still quickly broken through by more than 60% of the workers. More than 90% of the groups in Jiangxi Electric Machine Factory broke the quotas. The ranks of advanced producers are also constantly expanding. According to incomplete statistics from Nanchang, Jingdezhen, Jiujiang, Shangrao and four other cities, as well as the Gannan Administrative Region and Jiujiang Prefecture: a total of 5,236 labor models and advanced producers, and 220 advanced collectives have emerged.

    江西许多厂矿推广先进经验
    江西省许多厂矿在社会主义竞赛中广泛推广了先进经验。萍乡煤矿王家源矿今年推广一班采煤制、电溜子多台操纵等十多种先进经验后，生产效率分别提高10％到40％。赣州电厂推广利用炉管回热、提高气温的先进经验，每年可节约25，000多元。
    先进经验的推广大大地帮助了工人突破现行定额。萍乡矿务局高坑矿和王家源矿，今年一月份公布的新定额比去年定额平均提高17％，但仍旧很快地被60％以上的工人突破了。江西电机厂的90％以上的小组突破了定额。先进生产者的队伍也随着不断扩大。据南昌、景德镇、九江、上饶等四个市和赣南行政区以及九江专区的不完全统计：共涌现出劳动模范和先进生产者5，236人，先进集体220个。
