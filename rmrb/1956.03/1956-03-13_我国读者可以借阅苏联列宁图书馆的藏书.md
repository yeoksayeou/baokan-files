    Chinese Readers Can Borrow Books from the Soviet Lenin Library
    Beijing Library received a letter on the 8th from Mr. Bogachev, Director of the Soviet National Lenin Library, agreeing that Chinese readers can borrow their books through the Beijing Library. For rare editions of books and periodicals that cannot be borrowed, microfilm copies can be borrowed according to the needs of Chinese academic research. The borrowing period is 40 days, excluding mailing time.
    The Soviet National Lenin Library has more than 17 million volumes, making it the world's largest public library. Since establishing book exchange relations with it in 1949, Beijing Library has received newly published Soviet books and periodicals from Moscow every month. From January 1955 to February 1956 alone, more than 10,500 copies were sent. During the same period, Beijing Library also sent 11,000 copies of books and periodicals. (Xinhua News Agency)

    我国读者可以借阅苏联列宁图书馆的藏书
    北京图书馆8日接到苏联国立列宁图书馆馆长鲍加乔夫的来信，同意我国读者通过北京图书馆借阅他们的藏书，对于不能外借的珍贵版本书刊，也可以按我国学术研究的需要借用照下来的显微影片。每次借阅时间邮寄时间除外是40天。
    苏联国立列宁图书馆有1，700万册以上的藏书，是世界最大的公共图书馆。北京图书馆从1949年和它建立了图书交换关系以来，每月都收到从莫斯科寄来的苏联新出版的书刊。仅从1955年1月到1956年2月就寄来了10，500多册。在同一期间内，北京图书馆也寄去11，000多册书刊。　　　　　　　（新华社）
