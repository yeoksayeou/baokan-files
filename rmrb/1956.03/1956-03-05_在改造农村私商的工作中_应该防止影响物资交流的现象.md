    In the Work of Remolding Rural Private Merchants
    We Should Prevent Phenomena That Affect the Exchange of Goods
To the Editors:

    The socialist transformation of rural private merchants in Lukou Town (district-level town), Liling County, Hunan Province, has achieved great success: out of 210 private merchants in the town, 160 have transitioned to supply and marketing cooperative businesses, and 41 have organized cooperative groups and service agencies (including barber shops); only 9 have not yet been transformed. However, this town has handled some issues improperly in the socialist transformation of private merchants, thereby hindering the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. This situation deserves attention.

    Lukou Town merged the original 137 shopkeepers and 5 peddlers into 48 outlets of supply and marketing cooperatives and state-owned commercial departments. Many shops have moved, which has affected business to some extent. For example, Liu Bingfeng's shop's betel nuts were famous throughout the town, with a daily turnover of 40 to 50 yuan in the past. Since the shop moved, the turnover has dropped to 10 to 20 yuan per day. At the same time, the southern goods outlets and barber shops are very crowded, and farmers have to waste some time buying goods and getting haircuts.

    After the original private merchants merged into the supply and marketing cooperative's general merchandise outlets, the variety of goods has decreased; however, the cadres in charge of the transformation of private merchants are unaware of this situation. Originally, 20% to 30% of the goods sold by the small vendors in this town were not purchased from the supply and marketing cooperative, but were directly purchased from farmers and small handicraftsmen or purchased from other places. After these small vendors merged into the supply and marketing cooperative, they suddenly became salespersons with fixed wages, specializing in selling goods; the work of organizing sources of goods was entirely taken over by the supply and marketing cooperative's purchasing agents. As a result, the fire paper and other small local products that private merchants used to buy directly from producers in Hengshan and other places can no longer be purchased by the purchasing agents sent by the supply and marketing cooperative. Currently, there are still some stocks available, but they will be out of stock after they are sold out. In particular, the red yeast rice, ginger, yellow peppers, rice tofu, sweet potato vermicelli, white field paper, and "xiangbang" paper, which the local people urgently need for the Spring Festival, were all purchased directly from other places by private merchants in the past. Now the supply and marketing cooperative cannot purchase them in time, and they have already been out of stock before the Spring Festival. Some farmers complained: "Why are these goods no longer available after the transformation?"

    After private merchants become employees of the supply and marketing cooperative, they receive fixed wages like the cadres of the supply and marketing cooperative, and implement a system of responsibility for goods in kind, serving in various outlets. Because they are very unaccustomed to this system, and the leaders of the supply and marketing cooperative lack sufficient education and assistance for them, these salespersons are uneasy, fearing losses and punishment, and their enthusiasm and initiative to serve customers have been weakened. For this reason, the January turnover of the southern goods outlet decreased by 30% compared to December last year, and by 48% compared to the same period last year; the January turnover of the general merchandise department decreased by 35% compared to December last year; the turnover of state-owned pharmaceutical and catering industries also decreased.

    The socialist transformation of rural private merchants should achieve the goals of expanding commodity circulation, ensuring the needs of the masses, and further supporting industrial and agricultural production. These phenomena in Lukou Town are entirely caused by improper handling of the original private merchants' wage system, blindly adjusting the commercial network, and eagerly changing the original business system of private merchants. Now, the leading organs in Lukou Town have paid attention to solving these problems in accordance with the instructions of the State Council. In order to prevent this kind of chaotic phenomenon from recurring in the work of transforming rural private merchants in various places, I am reporting this situation to you in order to arouse widespread attention.

### 在改造农村私商的工作中  应该防止影响物资交流的现象

    在改造农村私商的工作中
    应该防止影响物资交流的现象编辑同志：
    湖南省醴陵县渌口镇（区级镇）对农村私商的社会主义改造工作已经取得了很大的成绩：全镇210户私商，已经有160户过渡为供销社商业，有41户组织了合作小组和服务社（理发业在内）；还没有改造的只有9户。但是，这个镇在对私商的社会主义改造工作中还有一些问题处理得不恰当，因而阻碍了城乡物资交流。这种情况是值得引起注意的。
    渌口镇把原来的137户座商和5户摊贩并为供销社和国营商业部门的48个门市部，许多铺子都搬动了，因而对营业有了一些影响。如小商贩刘炳峰铺子里的槟榔是全镇有名的，过去每天营业额有40元到50元；自从铺面搬动以后，营业额就下降到每天10多元到20元。同时，南货门市和理发门市都很拥挤，农民买货、理发都要耽误一些时间。
    在原来的私商并入供销合作社的杂货门市部以后，商品品种已经减少了；而负责私商改造工作的干部却不知道这个情况。原来这个镇的小商贩有20％到30％的商品不是从供销合作社进货的，而是直接向农民、小手工业者收购或者到外地去采买的。这些小商贩合并到供销合作社以后，他们一下变成了拿固定工资、专管卖货的营业员；组织货源的工作全由供销社的采购员包起来。结果，过去私商从衡山等地向生产者直接买回的火纸等小土产，现在供销社所派的采购员买不到了；目前还有一些存货可以供应，等卖完后就会脱销。特别是当地群众过春节迫切需要的红曲、生姜、黄辣椒、糜豆腐，红薯粉丝、白田纸、相帮纸等商品，过去都由私商直接向外地采购，现在供销社一时无法采购到，春节前都已经脱销了。有的农民就埋怨说：“为什么改造以后反而没有这些货了呢？”
    私商成为供销合作社的工作人员以后，同供销社干部一样都拿固定工资，实行实物负责制，在各个门市部服务。由于他们对于这一套制度很不习惯，供销合作社的领导方面对他们也缺乏足够的教育和帮助，因此这些营业员惶惶不安，怕赔钱受处分，为顾客服务的积极性和主动性就削弱了。由于这个原因，南货门市部1月份营业额比去年12月份下降了30％，比去年同期下降了48％；杂货部1月份营业额比去年12月份下降35％；国药饮食等业的营业额也有下降现象。
    对农村私商进行社会主义改造，应该达到扩大商品流转、保证群众需要和进一步支援工农业生产的目的。渌口镇出现的这些现象，完全是因为对原来私商工资制度处理不够妥当、盲目调整商业网和急于改变原有私商的经营制度而造成的。现在，渌口镇的领导机关已经根据国务院的指示注意解决这些问题。为了使各地在改造农村私商的工作中不再出现这种混乱现象，我把这个情况向你们反映，以便引起普遍的注意。
