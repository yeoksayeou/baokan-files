    A Party Branch That Paves the Way for New Things
    By Our Correspondent Zhang Shihong
    The growth of new things is achieved through various struggles. If the Party organizations in factories and mines want their leadership to keep pace with reality, they should be good at seizing the new things that are happening every day and every moment, supporting them, and paving the way for their growth. The coal mining method of 160-meter professional team assembly line operation proposed by Pang Guanxiang, a worker, and Zhou Guangduan, a technician, in the No. 6 mining area of the Fushun Tiger Platform Mining Area, can increase the coal mining rate by more than 100%. The realization and rapid promotion of this initiative are inseparable from the efforts of the Party branch of the No. 6 mining area.
    After Pang Guanxiang and Zhou Guangduan's proposal was put forward, the Party Committee attached great importance to it. From the branch to the Party Committee, several symposiums were held with technicians and veteran workers to discuss the proposal. After affirming that the proposal could be realized, the Party branch immediately shifted its Party work to this aspect, paving the way for new things from two aspects: on the one hand, fighting against the right-leaning conservative thinking of the cadres in the area, so that every cadre would attach importance to this initiative; on the other hand, fully mobilizing the masses to support this initiative.
    At that time, there were only three or four days left until the end of 1955, but the Party Committee instructed the branch to make preparations immediately so that it could be tried out in the first coal mining team after New Year's Day. According to the instructions of the Party Committee, the branch immediately convened an enlarged meeting of the branch committee to discuss how to carry out the preparatory work. At this meeting, some administrative cadres and technicians, led by the district chief (a Party member), put forward opposing opinions. They believed that it was somewhat "risky" to reform the coal mining method immediately, and the reasons were three: First, there was a lot of gangue in the current working face. According to the general saying, one cubic meter of gangue would result in four tons less of coal. Therefore, there was no certainty that the trial reform would increase production. If it did not increase production, they would be ridiculed, so it was better to wait until the situation of the working face improved before trying the reform; second, it would take a long time for workers to master advanced coal mining methods, and they were afraid that they would not be able to learn it in a short period of time; third, they were afraid that it would not be easy to get workers to accept new things in three or four days. Adopting advanced coal mining methods did have difficulties, but the question was how to overcome the difficulties, while they advocated retreating in the face of difficulties. However, most of the Party members, led by the branch secretary, supported the decision of the Party Committee. The branch secretary refuted the above three reasons. He pointed out that the enthusiasm of the workers was unprecedentedly high, which was the most favorable condition for overcoming difficulties. Moreover, the first coal mining team had a glorious combat tradition and had won production awards twice. As early as July, when the coal mining method had not been improved, they had increased production in the case of a lot of gangue. If we believed that reforming the coal mining method could increase the coal mining rate, then we should not worry about the problem of increasing production; moreover, only by trying it under difficult conditions can we see whether this reform is better than not reforming; secondly, workers should learn from practice, learning and doing at the same time, and cannot wait until they have fully learned it before doing it. In three or four days, technicians can first teach them three basic methods: drilling deep holes, building sheds, and operating sequences, which can be done; as for the ideological mobilization of workers, that should be done by all Party members, which was originally the task of the Party organization. In this way, the three reasons were untenable, and those who were afraid of difficulties were persuaded for the first time. As a result, the Party immediately carried out the division of labor. The next day, the branch held another general meeting of Party members and made a resolution, and each Party member set out guarantee conditions. Thanks to the efforts of all Party members to mobilize the masses, by the end of the year, various preparatory work had been basically completed.
    On January 5, problems occurred when the new method was put into trial operation. Due to the increase in production, there were not enough coal cars, and the downtime of each professional team was relatively long; and the electric chute for transporting coal suddenly broke down again, and could not work for 3.5 hours, resulting in the second shift's shoveling team working overtime for 4 hours. At this time, some administrative cadres, technicians and workers began to doubt whether this coal mining method was good, and some said: "If you work like this, I'm afraid you won't be able to complete the task in half a lifetime." Some said: "The old method is more stable." In the face of difficulties, the branch took a firm and calm attitude. On the one hand, the branch checked the cause of the accident. It was found that the damage to the electric chute was caused by the poor quality of the wire, which had nothing to do with the improved coal mining method. The shortage of coal cars was because the transportation capacity could not keep up after the increase in production, which must be solved, which precisely showed that the improved coal mining method could increase production. On the other hand, the branch immediately counted the output after the improved coal mining method on the first day, and found that although the accident occurred, the output was still nearly 20% higher than usual. Therefore, the branch convened a meeting of all cadres and workers of the first coal mining team, and the branch secretary explained the cause of the accident at the meeting, and announced the output on the first day of the improved coal mining method, so those who doubted also believed in the superiority of the advanced coal mining method.
    But conservative thinking is not so easy to overcome. Although the coal mining method reform experiment was successful, the district chief and deputy district chief of this district did not seriously summarize it. On the contrary, they believed that the coal mining method reform had nothing new except for the deep hole drilling. Therefore, they did not actively support it during the trial operation and adopted a dilatory attitude towards the allocation of cadre backbone forces. This became the main obstacle to the promotion of advanced coal mining methods. Therefore, after the branch initially summarized the experience of the trial implementation of advanced coal mining methods, it held an enlarged meeting of the branch to discuss the understanding of advanced coal mining methods. At this meeting, the branch secretary analyzed the content of the advanced coal mining method in detail, systematically explaining the innovative significance of this coal mining method from 11 aspects, such as the depth of drilling, the amount of explosives, the distance of the empty roof, the drilling tools, the division of labor and the organization of labor. And pointed out that in order to fully realize this initiative, the Party and administrative leadership must actively support it from all aspects. After the education of this meeting, the ideological understanding of the two district chiefs changed. They began to support this initiative with positive actions. After the Party and the leaders had a unified understanding, the branch used the propaganda network to further publicize the role of advanced coal mining methods to technicians and workers.
    During the trial operation, in addition to adjusting the strength of Party members and activists in the first coal mining team and repeatedly conducting ideological mobilization for the workers, the branch secretary and branch committee members also went to the site to understand the operation situation. As soon as a problem was found, they would solve it. For example, on the third day of the trial operation, there was a phenomenon of non-cooperation in the operation of various professional teams. A drilling team led by Zhu Qingchun in the first shift left after blasting. They did not care even if some eyes had not exploded, which brought difficulties to the work of the shoveling team. The shoveling workers raised their opinions, and the workers of the drilling team said: "Isn't it professional? What does the drilling team care about the shoveling team?" After the branch discovered this situation, it immediately educated the workers of this drilling team, and at the same time publicized the advanced deeds of the drilling team led by Chen Guisuo (a Party member) in helping the shoveling team after completing the task ahead of schedule, so that the workers of this drilling team admitted their mistakes and improved their work. Due to the implementation of sectional assembly line operation, the working face was widened, the manpower was dispersed, and the two squad leaders were emotional. They said: "In the past, it was easy to lead, but now it is not easy to be a squad leader." On the one hand, the branch educated them not to look at new things with old eyes, and pointed out the various benefits of improving the coal mining method; on the other hand, it began to solve their specific difficulties and studied the division of labor of the squad leaders at the squad leader meeting with the administration, and decided that each squad leader would be responsible for a professional team. After the division of labor was clear, the ideological problems of the two squad leaders were solved.
    While overcoming one difficulty after another, production results were rising steadily. By the 9th day of the trial operation, the daily output increased from 620 tons to 987 tons, and by the beginning of March, it had reached 1,048 tons, and the phenomenon of frequent downtime and overtime work had been basically eliminated. Now, the advanced coal mining method of the first coal mining team has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and the new production order has been consolidated. The entire Tiger Platform mining area and other brother mining areas are rapidly promoting this advanced coal mining method and learning their spirit of boldly breaking through old rules and bravely overcoming difficulties.

    一个为新事物开辟道路的党支部
    本报记者　章世鸿
    新事物的成长是要通过各种各样的斗争来实现的。厂矿党组织如果要使自己的领导不落后于实际，应该善于抓住每日每时在发生着的新事物，扶植它，为它的成长开辟道路。抚顺老虎台矿区六采区工人庞观祥和技术员周广端提出160米专业队流水作业的采煤法，可使采煤率提高100％以上，这个创举所以能够实现并且迅速推广，是和六采区党支部的努力分不开的。
    庞观祥和周广端的建议提出后，党委会十分重视。从支部到党委会分别邀请技术人员和老工人开了几次座谈会，专门讨论了这个建议。在肯定这个建议可以实现之后，党支部立即把党的工作转到这方面来，从两方面来为新事物开辟道路：一方面是和区内干部的右倾保守思想作斗争，使每个干部都来重视这个创举；另一方面是充分发动群众来支持这个创举。
    当时离1955年年底只有三、四天，但党委会责成支部立即做好准备工作，以便元旦后先在第一采煤队试行。根据党委的指示，支部当即召开了支委扩大会议，讨论如何进行准备工作。就在这个会上，以区长（党员）为首的一部分行政干部和技术员提出了相反的意见，他们认为立即改革采煤方法有些“冒险”，理由有三：第一，目前掌子面夹石多，按照一般的说法，出一立方米夹石就要少出四吨煤，因此试行改革能否增产毫无把握，如果不能增产，反被人耻笑，不如等掌子面情况好转后再来试行；第二，工人掌握先进采煤方法需要较长的时间，短期内怕学不会；第三，工人接受新事物的思想怕也不容易在三、四天内打通。采用先进采煤方法，的确有困难，问题在于如何来克服困难，而他们主张在困难面前退却。但以支部书记为首的大部分党员都支持党委会的决定。支部书记反驳了上面三条理由。他指出，目前工人群众生产热情空前高涨，这是克服困难最有利的条件。何况第一采煤队有光荣的战斗传统，两次得过生产优胜奖状，早在7月份，当时采煤法没有改进，他们就在夹石多的情况下提高了产量，如果我们相信改革采煤方法是能够提高采煤率的，那就不应该担心增产问题；而且只有在困难的条件下试行，才能看出这种改革是否比不改革好；其次，工人应该从实践中去学习，边学边干，不能等完全学会了再干。在三、四天内，可以使技术员先教会他们打深眼、搭棚子、操作次序等3个基本方法，这是可以做到的；至于工人的思想动员工作，那应由全体党员来做，这原来就是党组织的任务。这样，三条理由都站不住脚，害怕困难的人第一次被说服了。于是党内立即进行了分工。第二天，支部又召开了党员大会，做出了决议，每个党员都订出了保证条件。由于全体党员动员群众一起努力，到年底，各项准备工作基本上完成了。
    1月5日，开始试行新方法，就发生了问题。由于产量增加，装煤的车皮不够用，各专业队停工时间较多；而运煤的电溜子突然又出了毛病，3个半小时不能工作，结果使第二班攉锹队加班4小时。这时候，一部分行政干部、技术人员和工人对这种采煤法是不是好发生了怀疑，有的说：“这样干，怕半辈子不能完成任务。”有的说：“还不如老办法稳当。”在困难面前，支部采取了坚定的冷静的态度。一方面支部检查了事故发生的原因。发现电溜子损坏是电线质量不好所致，和改进采煤法无关。车皮不够用是因为产量提高后运输力量跟不上，必须着手解决，这正说明改进采煤法可以提高产量。另一方面，支部立即统计了第一天改进采煤法后的产量，发现尽管发生了事故，但产量仍然比平时提高了将近20％。于是支部召集了第一采煤队全体干部和工人会议，支部书记在会上说明了事故发生的原因，并且宣布了改进采煤法第一天的产量，于是那些怀疑的人也相信先进采煤法的优越性了。
    但保守思想不是那样容易克服的。虽然采煤法改革的试验成功了，这个区的区长和副区长却没有认真加以总结，反认为采煤法的改革除了深打眼一点外，再没有新的东西，因此，在试行过程中积极支持不够，对干部骨干力量的配备采取了拖延的态度。这就成了推广先进采煤法的主要阻力。于是支部在初步总结试行先进采煤法的经验后，召开了一次支部扩大会议，讨论对先进采煤法的认识问题。在这个会议上，支部书记详细分析了先进采煤法的内容，从打眼深度、火药量、空顶距离到打眼工具、工种分工和劳动组织等11个方面来系统地说明这种采煤法的革新意义。并且指出，要使这个创举能够全部实现，必须党和行政领导上从各个方面积极支持。经过这次会议的教育以后，两个区长的思想认识有了转变。他们开始用积极的行动支持这个创举了。当党内和领导干部的认识统一后，支部就通过宣传网，向技术人员和工人群众进一步宣传先进采煤法的作用。
    在试行过程中，党支部除调整第一采煤队的党员和积极分子力量，反复对工人群众进行思想动员外，支部书记和支部委员都分头深入现场了解操作情况，一发现问题就去解决。如试行第三天，各专业队操作中发生了互不合作的现象。一班祝庆春领导的一个打眼队放完炮就走了，有的眼火药还没有炸，他们也不管，给攉锹队的工作带来困难，攉锹工提出了意见，打眼队的工人说：“不是专业吗？打眼的那管攉锹的事。”支部发现了这种情况，立即对这个打眼队的工人进行教育，同时宣传了陈桂所（党员）领导的打眼队在提前完成任务后帮助攉锹队工作的先进事迹，使这个打眼队工人承认了错误，改进了工作。由于实行分段流水作业，工作面加宽，人力分散，两个班长闹情绪了，他们说：“过去领导起来多顺手，现在班长可不好当。”支部一方面教育他们不要用旧眼光去看新事物，指出改进采煤法的种种好处；另一方面，着手解决他们的具体困难，和行政一起在班长会议上研究了班长的分工问题，决定每个班长负责一个专业队，分工明确后，两个班长的思想问题就解决了。
    在克服一个接着一个的困难的同时，生产成绩蒸蒸日上。试行到第9天，日产量就从620吨提高到987吨，到3月初，已达到1，048吨，并且基本上消灭了停工多和加班加点的现象。现在，第一采煤队的先进采煤法已经深入人心，新的生产秩序已巩固地建立起来了。老虎台全矿区和其他兄弟矿区正在迅速推广这种先进采煤法，并且学习他们大胆突破陈规和勇敢地克服困难的精神。
