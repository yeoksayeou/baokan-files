Universally Rectify Cooperatives and Launch Spring Ploughing Production

    In recent months, tremendous changes have taken place in China's cities and villages. Socialism has gained an absolute dominant position in the countryside. By mid-February this year, more than 100 million peasant households had joined agricultural production cooperatives, accounting for 85% of the total number of peasant households in the country; among them, peasant households belonging to advanced cooperatives accounted for 48% of the total number of peasant households in the country. Some provinces and regions have already achieved complete socialist cooperation. The development of the cooperative movement is very rapid, vigorous, healthy, and normal. After being organized, the jubilant peasants, regardless of the severe cold of the "dog days," have launched a vigorous production upsurge. They are opening canals, digging wells, accumulating fertilizer, preparing land, and purchasing production materials in preparation for this year's large-scale agricultural production. In many counties in Henan, Shandong, and other provinces, the number of water wells increased in a few months exceeded the total number of water wells that have existed for thousands of years. We say that the development of the movement is very normal and healthy, and this is the most powerful proof.
    However, we must also see that in a fierce and large-scale mass movement, a certain degree of roughness is inevitable. At the same time, due to the very rapid progress of the movement, after the establishment of cooperatives, issues such as the entry of means of production into the cooperatives, labor organization, and production plans have not had time to be systematically and properly resolved and handled. The methods and steps of agricultural cooperation and the transformation of private industry and commerce are different. Under the encouragement of the masses' socialist enthusiasm, the transformation of private industry and commerce can first approve joint ventures, and then gradually carry out asset inventory work and gradually change various unreasonable systems within a few months, half a year, or even longer. After a factory or store announces a joint venture, it can and should continue to operate as usual without any changes to the original setup. The situation of agricultural cooperation is different. Individual peasants form cooperatives, small cooperatives merge into large cooperatives, and elementary cooperatives are upgraded to advanced cooperatives. The original production organization is disrupted and changed, and a new production organization must be established in a timely manner to carry out organized production. Otherwise, production will be temporarily stalled and chaotic due to uncertainty in the overall situation. That is to say, the handling of various economic issues within the cooperative, the establishment of labor organization and production management systems, must keep up closely, and these issues cannot be temporarily left unattended, otherwise it will be detrimental to the development of production. "Rain Water" has passed, and the season for busy farming is approaching. Carrying out preparatory work for farming and welcoming this year's spring ploughing have become urgent tasks. The matter is very clear: after the great development of cooperatives, striving for another bumper harvest year will make the vast number of peasants even more jubilant and supportive of the path of cooperation, which will have a huge impact on the consolidation and improvement of cooperatives and the continued development of the cooperative movement. If we relax leadership over production at this time, if the production order within the cooperative cannot be established for a long time, and the agricultural season is delayed, reducing output, it will greatly frustrate the enthusiasm of the peasants. Therefore, the current urgent task in rural areas is to quickly rectify and consolidate cooperatives, carry out preparatory work for farming, organize the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants into a production upsurge, and welcome the large-scale spring ploughing production movement. Therefore, societies that are being expanded and upgraded should complete these tasks as soon as possible and quickly shift to production. Societies that have not yet been merged or upgraded should not continue to change before spring ploughing. Under the circumstances that the production season is approaching, too many changes and the inability to settle down in terms of production order will have a very unfavorable impact on striving to complete this year's agricultural production increase task.
    Is placing spring ploughing production in the main position of leadership work a conservative approach to the cooperative movement? No, it is not. Experience in the development of the movement has proven that once peasants embark on the socialist road, they must indeed carry out the revolution to the end, which is the foundation and inevitable trend for the universal upgrading of elementary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives in some areas. However, it must also be recognized that not all regions already possess these conditions. Many regions that were liberated later, have a weaker cooperative foundation, and do not have much experience in running advanced cooperatives cannot advance at the same speed as regions that were liberated earlier, have a better cooperative foundation, and have gained more experience in piloting advanced cooperatives. And from the perspective of the leadership's work steps, according to different work foundations and conditions, in accordance with the spirit of the "National Agricultural Development Program," basically achieving cooperation in advanced forms in 1956 or 1957, or even in 1958 for a small number, is not considered slow. We should formulate realistic plans for developing advanced cooperatives based on local conditions, and not unrealistically chase "advanced" models, and not continue to unilaterally pursue the quantity of cooperation without regard to the task of organizing production when production is already very urgent. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in the preface to "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside": "No one can engage in unfounded fantasies, plan their actions beyond the conditions permitted by objective circumstances, and do not force themselves to do things that are really impossible." Therefore, we say that after effectively overcoming right-leaning thoughts and conservatism, after giving a correct assessment of the socialist enthusiasm and actions of the masses, it is completely correct to put the leadership center on the production side in the current situation where spring ploughing is approaching, and it is by no means conservatism.
    Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us in the report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation": "We must emphasize paying attention to the quality of cooperatives and oppose the tendency to disregard quality and only pursue the number of cooperatives and peasant households. Therefore, we must pay attention to the work of rectifying societies." Comrade Mao Zedong's instruction is of great significance for the actual situation of the current cooperative movement. Since the second half of last year, the development of the cooperative movement has been very rapid, and the movement has continued to advance for a long time. Some regions, in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, paid attention to improving quality during the process of building societies and successively carried out rectification and consolidation work, which is completely correct. However, there are also some places that have not sufficiently valued the quality of cooperatives and have not carried out effective rectification work. Therefore, the cooperatives in these places have not yet formed an organized production unit. The situation of "walking in a long line, working in a large area," "noisy and chaotic, like a hornet's nest" cannot but arouse the serious attention of the leadership.
    Rectifying cooperatives should be carried out around production. Rectifying cooperatives is precisely to promote current production. The cooperative earnestly does a good job in production, precisely to strive for those peasants who have not yet participated in the cooperative to participate, and to further prepare the conditions for raising elementary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives. Production performance is the barometer of the degree of consolidation of the cooperative. If the production enthusiasm of the members is very high, it means that the policy of voluntary mutual benefit in the cooperative is being implemented very well. If the production of the cooperative is very orderly, it means that the labor organization has been well established. If the opposite situation occurs in the cooperative, it means that the rectification work of the cooperative has not been done well, and more work needs to be done. The experience of many regions has proven that wherever the central link of production is grasped in the rectification of societies, many hidden problems will be discovered, and there will be a possibility of timely resolution. In this way, the cooperative is further consolidated, and production is also developed on a more solid foundation. In the work of rectifying cooperatives, in addition to correctly resolving issues related to the entry of means of production into the cooperatives and raising share funds in terms of policy, it is also necessary to pay attention to improving the management of cooperatives and gradually improve the labor organization, labor remuneration, and production plans of cooperatives, to benefit the development of production.
    Some people neither seize the leadership of spring ploughing production nor actively rectify cooperatives. They only talk vaguely about the superiority of cooperatives, as if increased production will naturally come once cooperatives are established. In fact, the day when agricultural production cooperatives are built is the time when many new tasks begin. Now that the cooperative is rectified, it will play a role in moving mountains and overturning seas in spring ploughing production, and better demonstrate the superiority of collective production. However, if the cooperative cannot be rectified in a timely manner, it will also experience temporary delays, chaos, and a phenomenon of no one being responsible, which is very detrimental to production. Stop the empty talk, take the necessary measures, guide the socialist enthusiasm of the masses towards production actions step by step, and complete and overfulfill the 1956 agricultural production plan. This is the most important task of the current rural work. All rural cadres, all party and league members, act and lead the farmers of all cooperatives with their exemplary actions and actively fight for the launch of an unprecedented, lively and hot large-scale production movement!

### 普遍整顿合作社，开展春耕生产

    普遍整顿合作社，开展春耕生产
    最近几个月，我国的城市和乡村发生了翻天覆地的大变化。社会主义在农村中取得了绝对优势的地位。到今年2月中旬已有1万万以上的农户加入农业生产合作社，占全国总农户数85％；其中属于高级社的农户占全国总农户的48％。有些省、区已经实现了完全社会主义的合作化。合作化运动的发展很迅速、很猛烈、很健康、很正常。欢欣鼓舞的农民在组织起来以后，不顾“数九”天的严寒，掀起轰轰烈烈的生产高潮。开渠、凿井、积肥、整地和购置生产资料，准备今年的农业大生产。河南、山东等省的许多县份，在几个月中增加的水井，超过了几千年来已有的水井的总数。我们说运动的发展很正常，很健康，这就是最有力的证明。
    但是，我们也必须看到，在猛烈的、大规模的群众运动中，不可避免地会发生某种程度的粗糙现象。同时，由于运动进展十分迅速，合作社建立起来以后，像生产资料入社、劳动组织、生产计划等问题，还没有来得及有系统地和妥善地解决和处理。农业合作化和私营工商业改造的作法和步骤，是不相同的。私营工商业的改造，在群众的社会主义热情鼓舞下，可以先批准合营，而后在几个月、半年甚至更长的时间内，逐步进行清产核资工作，逐步改变各种不合理的制度。一厂一店宣布合营以后，在原摊子没有变动以前，完全可以和应该照常营业。农业合作化的情形却不相同。个体农民组成合作社，小社并成大社，初级社升为高级社，原来的生产组织就打乱了、变化了，必须及时建立起新的生产组织，才能够进行有组织的生产。不然，就会因为大局不定，使生产暂时陷于停顿和混乱。这就是说，合作社内部各种经济问题的处理，劳动组织和生产管理制度的建立，都必须紧紧跟上去，不能把这些问题暂时放下不管，否则是不利于生产的发展的。“雨水”已过，农事大忙的季节已经迫近，开展备耕工作，迎接今年春耕，已经成为迫不及待的任务了。事情摆得很明显，在合作社大发展以后，再争取一个丰收年，广大农民将更加欢欣鼓舞，更加拥护合作化的道路，这对合作社的巩固和提高以及合作运动的继续发展，都会发生巨大作用。目前如果放松了对于生产的领导，如果合作社内的生产秩序迟迟不能建立起来，以致贻误了农时，减少了产量，那就会大大挫折农民的热情。因此，当前农村的迫切任务，是迅速整顿巩固合作社，开展备耕工作，把广大农民群众的社会主义热情组织到生产高潮中来，迎接大规模的春耕生产运动。因此，正在扩并和正在升级的社，要尽快完成这些工作，迅速转向生产。还没有进行合并或升级的社，在春耕以前就不要继续变动。在生产季节已经迫近的情况下，变动过多，不能在生产秩序方面安定下来，对争取完成今年的农业增产任务，将会发生十分不利的影响。
    把春耕生产放在领导工作的主要地位，对合作化运动来说，是否又保守了呢？不是的。运动发展经验已经证明：农民一旦走上社会主义道路，确实非把革命进行到底不可，这就是若干地区的初级社普遍升为高级社的基础和必然趋势。但是，同样必须认识，并不是一切地区都已经具备了这种条件的。许多解放较晚、合作化基础较弱，办高级社的经验还不很多的地区，就不能和解放较早、合作化基础较好、在试办高级社中已经取得较多经验的地区，采取一样的速度前进。而从领导方面的工作步骤来说，根据不同的工作基础和条件，按照“全国农业发展纲要”的精神，分别在1956年内或者1957年内，少数的甚至在1958年内基本上实现高级形式的合作化，这样的速度是不算慢的。我们应该根据当地的具体条件，定出切合实际的发展高级社的规划，而不要脱离实际地追赶“先进”，不要在生产已经十分紧迫的时候，不顾组织生产的任务，片面地继续追求合作化的数量。毛泽东同志在“中国农村的社会主义高潮”序言中指出：“任何人不可以无根据地胡思乱想，不可以超越客观情况所许可的条件去计划自己的行动，不要勉强地去做那些实在做不到的事情。”因此，我们说，当着有效地克服了右倾思想和保守主义以后，对于群众的社会主义热情和行动给以正确的估价以后，在目前春耕迫近的情况下，把领导中心摆到生产方面来，这是完全正确的，决不是什么保守主义。
    毛泽东同志在“关于农业合作化问题”的报告中指示我们：“必须强调注重合作社的质量，反对不顾质量、专门追求合作社和农户的数目字的那一种偏向。因此，必须注重整社的工作”。毛泽东同志的这个指示，对于目前的合作化运动的实际情况来说，更有重大的意义。从去年下半年开始，合作化运动的发展是十分迅速的，运动已经持续前进了很长时间，若干地区遵照毛泽东同志的指示，在建社过程中注意了提高质量的问题，陆续进行了整顿巩固工作，这是完全正确的。但是，也还有一些地方，一直没有足够地重视合作社的质量，没有进行有效的整顿工作。因此，这些地方的合作社就还没有形成一个有组织的生产单位。所谓“走起来一长串，做起活来一大片”，“乱吵吵，一窝蜂”的情况，不能不引起领导方面的严重注意。
    整顿合作社应该围绕生产进行。整顿合作社正是为了推动当前的生产。合作社认真把生产搞好，正是为了争取那些还没有参加合作社的农民参加进来，为了进一步准备把初级社提高为高级社的条件。生产成绩是合作社巩固程度的寒暑表。如果社员的生产积极性很高，那就表示合作社中自愿互利的政策贯彻执行的很好。如果合作社的生产很有秩序，那就表示劳动组织已经很好地建立起来了。如果合作社发生了相反的情况，那就表示合作社的整顿工作还没有做好，就要进行更多的工作。许多地区的经验证明，凡是在整社中抓住了生产这个中心环节，许多隐蔽着的问题就会被发现，就有了及时加以解决的可能。这样，合作社进一步巩固了，生产也在更加坚实的基础上发展了。在整顿合作社的工作中，除了必须在政策方面正确地解决有关生产资料入社和筹集股份基金等问题以外，还必须注意改进合作社的管理工作，逐步地搞好合作社的劳动组织，劳动报酬和生产计划，以利于生产的发展。
    有些人既不抓紧领导春耕生产，又不积极整顿合作社。只是空泛地谈论合作社的优越性，好像合作社一旦建立起来，增产自然就会到来似的。其实，农业生产合作社建成之日，正是许多新的工作开始之时。现在把合作社整顿好，它会在春耕生产上起着移山倒海的作用，更好地显示集体生产的优越性。但是，如果不能把合作社及时整顿好，它也会发生暂时的窝工、混乱、无人负责的现象，对生产是很不利的。停止空洞的谈论，采取必要的措施，把群众的社会主义的积极性，有步骤地引导向生产行动中去，完成和超额完成1956年农业生产计划，这就是当前农村工作最重要的任务。全体农村工作干部，全体党、团员行动起来，以自己的模范行动，带领全体合作社的农民，为开展一个史无前例的热火朝天的大生产运动而积极战斗！
