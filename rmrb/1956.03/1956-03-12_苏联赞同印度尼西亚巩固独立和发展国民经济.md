Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th dispatch: TASS Moscow, 10th dispatch: The Indonesian Chargé d'Affaires ad interim to the Soviet Union, Mr. Damanto, delivered two notes to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs on February 16 and 22.

    The note of February 16 stated that Mr. Damanto, upon instruction from the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia, notified the Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs that the Dutch-Indonesian negotiations held in Geneva from December 10, 1955, to normalize relations between the Republic of Indonesia and the Kingdom of the Netherlands, had ended without result on February 11, 1956.

    The note stated that in view of the Soviet government's consistent support, through its representative to the United Nations, for Indonesia's efforts to resolve the dispute peacefully, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia deemed it necessary to notify the Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs of the regrettable outcome mentioned above, despite all the efforts made by the Indonesian delegation to reach an agreement.

    In a note to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on February 22, Mr. Damanto stated that the government of the Republic of Indonesia, in the interest of the entire nation and particularly for the benefit of economic development, severed its federal relations with the Kingdom of the Netherlands on February 15 and 21, 1956, meaning that it was no longer bound by the financial and economic agreements mentioned in the federal regulations.

    On March 6 this year, the First Deputy Minister of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, V.V. Kuznetsov, received Mr. Damanto and handed him a reply note from Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov.

    In this reply note, Molotov assured the Indonesian Chargé d'Affaires that the Soviet government agreed with the feelings and desires of the Indonesian people in consolidating their national independence and further developing its national economy.

    苏联赞同印度尼西亚巩固独立和发展国民经济
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科10日讯：印度尼西亚驻苏联临时代办达曼托在2月16日和22日交给了苏联外交部两个照会。
    2月16日的一个照会说，达曼托奉印度尼西亚共和国外交部长的指示通知苏联外交部长，为使印度尼西亚共和国和荷兰王国之间的关系正常化而从1955年12月10日开始在日内瓦举行的荷兰一印度尼西亚谈判，已经在1956年2月11日无结果而结束。
    照会说，鉴于苏联政府通过自己的驻联合国代表在这一问题上一直支持印度尼西亚为了和平解决争执问题所作的努力，印度尼西亚共和国外交部长认为必须通知苏联外交部长上述令人遗憾的结局，虽然印度尼西亚代表团为了争取达成协议曾经作了种种努力。
    达曼托在2月22日致苏联外交部长莫洛托夫的照会说，印度尼西亚共和国政府为了本国的整个民族利益、特别是为了经济发展的利益，在1956年2月15日和21日断绝了自己同荷兰王国的联邦关系，这就是说它不再受联邦法规中所提到的财政和经济协定的约束。
    今年3月6日苏联外交部第一副部长瓦·瓦·库兹涅佐夫接见了达曼托，并且把苏联外交部长莫洛托夫的复照交给他。
    莫洛托夫在这个复照中向印度尼西亚代办保证，苏联政府赞同印度尼西亚人民在巩固他们国家的民族独立和进一步发展它的国民经济方面的感情和愿望。
