    Strict Personnel Organization Work System

    Preventing hidden class enemies from infiltrating our ranks is an extremely complex, acute, and long-term class struggle. In this struggle, the quality of our personnel organization work plays a significant role. Because the personnel organization department is an agency specifically in charge of people, anyone wanting to enter or leave our organs, enterprises, and other revolutionary organizations must pass through this checkpoint. As long as the comrades guarding this checkpoint possess a high degree of revolutionary vigilance, are good at relying on the masses, and can distinguish between good and bad people, then no matter how cleverly the hidden enemies disguise themselves or what insidious and cunning two-faced tactics they adopt, it will be difficult for them to infiltrate our ranks. Even if they do, they will be quickly exposed.

    Judging from the materials revealed in the struggle to eliminate hidden counter-revolutionaries, the level of our personnel organization work is still very backward. Many counter-revolutionaries and bad elements have infiltrated our organs, enterprises, and other revolutionary organizations, even our Party. The fact that counter-revolutionary rogue and swindler Li Wanming infiltrated our state organs and the Communist Party for as long as four years before being discovered vividly exposes the extreme lack of enemy awareness among many personnel organization workers and some responsible persons of local and central organs; their political indifference has reached a state of numbness. This also prominently exposes the serious and intolerable shortcomings and errors in the personnel work of certain organizational links of ours.

    Employing people must be done through the introduction of a certain organization; this is an important principle of our personnel work. New personnel must have a formal organizational introduction letter and other supporting documents, and they can only be accepted and employed after passing the examination of the personnel department. The reason why we must adhere to this principle is that only through formal organizational introduction and a clear understanding of the background of new personnel can we prevent counter-revolutionaries and bad elements from infiltrating our ranks by using methods such as changing their names and forging documents. Many state organs and enterprises have rudely violated this principle, often receiving and employing a large number of personnel through private introductions. As long as it is said that someone was introduced by a certain cadre, especially a certain responsible cadre, even if this person does not have any supporting documents and no one can definitively prove his past experience, the personnel department can accept him as a staff member and even place him in important and critical positions. Isn't it true that counter-revolutionaries and bad elements like Li Wanming infiltrated precisely by exploiting this major loophole in personnel work?

    Personnel working in our organs, enterprises, and other revolutionary organizations should not only possess a certain degree of working ability, but also be politically loyal and reliable, and faithful to the cause of the state and the people. To determine whether a staff member is politically loyal and reliable, his history must be carefully and responsibly examined when he is received and employed. His supporting documents should be carefully inspected, and his archival materials should be reviewed. When necessary, people should also be sent to the masses to investigate and verify his history. As long as this approach is consistently adhered to, then even if hidden enemies attempt to infiltrate our ranks by forging work introduction letters and other supporting documents, we will never be deceived by them and will easily strip off their masks. However, there are precisely many organs, enterprises, and other revolutionary organizations that are unwilling to earnestly implement this policy, often failing to conduct a detailed review of the history of new personnel, or even not reviewing it at all, thus absorbing some people with unclear backgrounds. Whether in the Northwest, Central-South, or Beijing, if an organ, upon receiving Li Wanming's forged demobilization introduction letter and archival materials, especially upon receiving his forged and ridiculously laughable "military transfer order" and "military urgent telegram," had contacted the "organ" or relevant departments that issued these "documents," then his not-so-clever fraud would have been exposed long ago.

    To prevent hidden class enemies from infiltrating our Party, in addition to Party organizations at all levels absorbing Party members according to the standards for Party members and strictly fulfilling the procedures for joining the Party, there must be a strict system of supporting documents when Party members and cadres are transferred to other jobs or need to transfer their organizational affiliation for other reasons. In the years since the nationwide liberation, the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee and the organization departments of some central organs have formulated some measures separately or jointly regarding the transfer of Party members' organizational affiliation, making unified provisions for the procedures that must be fulfilled for the transfer of Party members' organizational affiliation and the matters that should be paid attention to, as well as for the issuance, mailing procedures, and formats of the introduction letters for transferring affiliation. However, because the responsible persons of the organization departments of many Party committees failed to recognize the political significance of strictly implementing these regulations, mistakenly regarding them as purely technical work, they often assigned this work to people lacking political experience, thus allowing counter-revolutionaries like Li Wanming and elements with ulterior motives to seize the opportunity to infiltrate our Party.

    Why did the above phenomena occur? The most fundamental reason is that many of our people have developed a serious sense of complacency and paralysis. One of the main manifestations of this sense of complacency and paralysis is that many organs, enterprises, and other revolutionary organizations do not strictly follow the system when receiving and employing personnel, often treating this work with an extremely irresponsible bureaucratic attitude, and there is also a blindly trusting idealist style of thinking. An important reason why Li Wanming, this counter-revolutionary rogue and swindler, was able to transform himself into a state worker and a Communist Party member is that he consistently portrayed himself as a "revolutionary disabled soldier" who had rendered meritorious service to the people. In particular, the reason why his scams from the Northwest to the Central-South and then from the Central-South to Beijing achieved even greater "success" was mainly because he portrayed himself as an "old Red Army soldier," "combat hero," and "model Communist Party member" who had joined the revolution early on, and the Party introducers and historical witnesses he fabricated were all responsible Party and government officials in the central organs. This led some responsible comrades in the former Central-South Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Central Ministry of Forestry not only to not suspect his history but also to trust his words and deeds very much. Even when someone formally reported him, it did not awaken these responsible comrades.

    In order to earnestly learn lessons from such incidents that have already occurred, it is necessary to widely conduct education among Communist Party members and state workers, resolutely eliminate the bad work style of carelessness and bureaucracy, especially to resolutely overcome the blindly trusting idealist style of thinking; it is necessary to carefully inspect and improve the work system of state organs, especially the personnel organization work system, and cultivate a good work style of strictly following the system.

    严密人事组织工作制度
    防止暗藏的阶级敌人混进我们内部，是极为复杂的尖锐的和长期的阶级斗争。在这个斗争中，我们的人事组织工作的好坏，起着重大的作用。因为人事组织部门是一个专管人的机构，任何人要想进出我们的机关、企业和其他革命组织，都必须经过这道关口。只要把守这个关口的同志有着高度的革命警惕，善于依靠群众，识别好人和坏人，那末，不管暗藏的敌人伪装得多么巧妙，采取了多么阴险狡诈的两面派手法，都很难混进我们内部；即使混进来了，也会很快被清查出来。
    从肃清暗藏的反革命分子的斗争中所揭出的材料来看，我们的人事组织工作的水平仍然很落后。不少反革命分子和坏分子还混进了我们的机关、企业和其他革命组织，甚至混进了我们的党内。反革命流氓骗子李万铭混入我们的国家机关和共产党内达四年之久才被发现，就突出地暴露了许多人事组织工作人员和一些地方和中央机关的负责人十分缺乏敌情观念，他们政治上的漫不经心已经达到了麻木不仁的地步；这也突出地暴露了我们某些组织环节上的人事工作的缺点和错误是严重的，不能容忍的。
    用人必须经过一定组织的介绍，这是我们的人事工作的一项重要原则。新来人员必须有正式的组织介绍信和其他证明文件，经过人事部门审查合格以后，才能接收和任用他们。我们所以要坚持这个原则，是因为只有经过正式的组织介绍，确实知道新来人员的来历，才能防止反革命分子和坏分子用隐姓埋名和伪造文件的方法混进我们内部。不少国家机关、企业部门粗暴地违反了这个原则，往往通过私人介绍大量地接收和任用人员。只要说是某某干部、特别是某某负责干部介绍的，纵使这个人没有任何证明文件，也没有人确实证明他过去的经历，人事部门也可以把他接收为工作人员，甚至把他摆在重要的和要害的工作岗位上。李万铭等反革命分子和坏分子不就是利用人事工作上的这个重大漏洞而混进来的吗？
    在我们的机关、企业以及其他革命组织中工作的人员，不仅应该具有一定的工作能力，而且要在政治上忠诚可靠，忠实于国家和人民的事业。而要辨明一个工作人员是否在政治上忠诚可靠，就必须在接收和任用他的时候，对他的历史作认真负责的审查。要仔细地检验他的证明文件，审查他的档案材料；在必要的时候，还应派人到群众中去调查和对证他的历史。只要一贯地坚持这种作法，那末，纵使暗藏的敌人企图用伪造工作介绍信和其他证明文件的办法混进我们内部，我们也就决不会受他们的欺骗，就会很容易地剥去他们的假面具。但是，恰恰有不少机关、企业和其他革命组织不愿认真地执行这一方针，往往对新来人员的历史不作详细的审查，甚至根本不审查，因而把一些来历不明的人也吸收了进来。不论在西北、中南或者在北京，如果有一个机关在接到李万铭伪造的转业介绍信和档案材料，特别是在接到他伪造的荒唐可笑的“军事调令”和“军急电报”的时候，能够同发出这些“文件”的“机关”或有关部门联系一下，那末，他的并不高明的骗局一定早就被揭穿了。
    要防止暗藏的阶级敌人混进我们党内，除了各级党组织必须按照党员标准吸收党员，必须严格履行入党手续以外，在党员、干部调动工作或因其他原故需要转移组织关系的时候，必须有一套严密的证明文件制度。全国解放几年以来，中共中央组织部和中央有些机关的组织部门曾经单独地或者联合地制定了一些关于党员转移组织关系的办法，对于党员转移组织关系必须履行的手续和应注意的事项，对于转移关系的介绍信的填发、寄送手续和格式，都作了统一的规定。但是，由于不少党委机关组织部门的负责人没有认识到严格执行这些规定的政治意义，错误地把它们看成了单纯的技术工作，常常把这个工作交给缺乏政治经验的人去做，因而使得像李万铭这样的反革命分子和别有用心的分子能够乘机混进了我们党内。
    为什么会发生上述种种现象呢？最根本的原因是我们的许多人滋长了一种严重的太平麻痹思想。这种太平麻痹思想的主要表现形式之一，就是许多机关、企业和其他革命组织在接收和任用人员的时候，不严格按照制度办事，往往以极不负责的官僚主义态度对待这一工作，而且有一种盲目信任的唯心主义的思想作风。李万铭这个反革命的流氓骗子，所以能够摇身一变成了我们的国家工作人员和共产党员，重要的原因之一，是他一贯把自己装扮成了对人民有功的“革命残废军人”。特别是他由西北到中南、又由中南到北京的诈骗所以获得了更大的“成功”，主要是因为他把自己装扮成了早年就参加革命的“老红军”、“战斗英雄”和“模范共产党员”，他捏造的入党介绍人和历史证明人又都是中央机关的党政负责人。这就使得前中南农林部和中央林业部的一些负责同志不但没有怀疑过他的历史，而且对他的一言一行都非常信任，甚至有人正式检举了他，也没有惊醒这些负责同志。
    为着切实地从已经发生过的这类事件中吸取教训，必须广泛地在共产党员和国家工作人员中开展教育，坚决肃清麻痹大意和官僚主义的恶劣作风，特别是要坚决克服盲目信任的唯心主义的思想作风；必须认真地检查和改进国家机关工作制度、特别是人事组织工作制度，并且养成严格按照制度办事的良好作风。
