Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 27th. According to the Vietnam News Agency, Major General Phan Trong Tue, Chief Representative of the Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army to the Vietnam Central Joint Armistice Commission, handed a memorandum to the Delegation of the High Command of the French Union Forces on March 24th, strongly protesting the increasingly serious violations of many important provisions of the Geneva Accords by the South Vietnamese authorities.

    The memorandum uses concrete evidence to illustrate that the South Vietnamese administrative authorities, with the connivance of the High Command of the French Union Forces, have been increasing their armed forces, illegally transporting new military personnel and supplies into South Vietnam, actually forming a military alliance with the United States, and desperately preparing for a new war. In addition, the South Vietnamese authorities also held sham "referendums" and unilateral elections, undermining the political provisions of the Geneva Accords, attempting to turn South Vietnam into a separate state completely opposed to North Vietnam, and turning the temporary military demarcation line into a political and territorial border, in order to permanently divide Vietnam.

    The memorandum points out that in order to realize these illegal conspiracies, the South Vietnamese administrative authorities have been implementing a policy of terror and retaliation against former resistance personnel, and inhumanely suppressing all people in South Vietnam who love peace and unification. In addition, it has also been openly obstructing the activities of the International Commission.

    The memorandum also particularly emphasizes the responsibility of the High Command of the French Union Forces—a signatory to the Geneva Accords. The memorandum states that recently, the Delegation of the High Command of the French Union Forces has been trying to reduce the power and tasks of the Central Joint Armistice Commission. At the same time, it has repeatedly refused to attend the regular meetings of the commission. The purpose of doing so is to reduce the role of the joint body responsible for ensuring the implementation of the provisions of the Geneva Accords.

    The memorandum concludes by saying that the High Command of the French Union Forces must be responsible for the above situation and all its consequences.

    越方致函法方抗议南越当局严重破坏日内瓦协定
    新华社河内27日电　据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军总司令部驻越南中央联合停战委员会代表团首席代表潘重慧少将在三月二十四日交给法兰西联邦部队总司令部代表团的备忘录中，对南越当局越来越严重地破坏日内瓦协定的许多重要条款的行为提出了强烈抗议。
    备忘录以具体证据说明，南越行政当局在法兰西联邦部队总司令部的纵容下一直在增加它的武装部队、非法地把新的军事人员和军用物资运入南越，实际上同美团结成军事联盟，并且在拚命地准备新的战争。此外，南越当局还举行了冒牌的“公民投票”和片面选举，破坏了日内瓦协定的政治条款，企图把南越变成一个同北越完全对立的单独的国家，并且把临时性的军事分界线变成一条政治的和领土的边界，以便使越南永远分裂下去。
    备忘录指出，为了实现这些非法的阴谋，南越行政当局一直在对以前的抗战人员实行恐怖和报复的政策，并且毫无人道地镇压南越所有爱好和平和统一的人们。此外，它还一直公开地阻挠国际委员会的活动。
    备忘录还特别强调指出法兰西联邦部队总司令部——日内瓦协定的签字者——的责任。备忘录说，最近，法兰西联邦部队总司令部代表团一直试图缩小中央联合停战委员会的权力和任务。同时，它还数次拒绝参加委员会的常会。这样做的目的在于降低负有保证实施日内瓦协定的各项条款的责任的联合机构的作用。
    备忘录最后说，法兰西联邦部队总司令部必须对上述情况和它的一切后果负责。
