Jiangsu: 3 Million Peasants Working on Water Conservancy Projects

The spring water conservancy project in Jiangsu Province has been fully launched, with 3 million peasants working on it across the province. This year, various regions have made full preparations for the spring repair projects in general, with an early start and rapid progress. Various regions have completed more than 55 million cubic meters of earthwork, more than doubling the speed of the same period last year. Jiangpu County has completed 75% of the spring repair task, and Tangshi District of Changshu County has completed 95%. The Xuzhou area's plan to dig 134,000 wells is being accelerated, and more than 1.37 million mu of wheat can be irrigated in March. Tangshan District of Jiangning County has designated March as a "Water Conservancy Blitz Month", implementing fixed personnel, fixed time, fixed tasks, and fixed work quotas to ensure the completion of 700,000 cubic meters of earthwork in 40 days for the spring repair task. This year's spring repair task is more than twice the total of the six years after liberation.
