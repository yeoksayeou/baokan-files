    纳赛尔向美国记者谈苏美对中东各国的不同的态度
    新华社17日讯　开罗消息：埃及总理纳赛尔在3月15日对一批到开罗访问的美国编辑发表谈话时，指责美国支持殖民主义。纳赛尔在谈到阿拉伯人对美国的态度的时候说，美国在联合国中反对一切自由的原则。
    纳赛尔在谈到苏联对中东的政策的时候说，“我们了解俄国是在帮助我们。每一次有什么涉及我们的自由的问题提交联合国，它总是支持我们的。因此，你绝不能忽视在这里占支配地位的舆论。”
    纳赛尔还对美国编辑们说，“你可以说任何反对俄国或者共产主义的话，同时也可以说俄国是我们的敌人。但是，这里的人民抱着怀疑的态度，他们喜欢提出他们自己的意见，作出他们自己的决定。”
