Singapore People's Struggle for Independence
Mass Meeting to Fight for Independence
More than 50,000 residents of Singapore held a massive mass meeting at Kallang Airport in Singapore on March 18, demanding an end to Malayan colonial rule and immediate independence for Singapore.

The meeting was initiated by the Singapore "Movement Committee of All Political Parties for Singapore Independence" and was supported by various trade unions and mass organizations in Singapore. The masses participating in this meeting were in high spirits, chanting "We demand immediate independence!" and "End colonialism!"

Singapore's Chief Minister, Marshall, representative of the Labor Front, representatives of the Liberal Socialist, the Singapore branch of the United Malays National Organisation, the People's Action Party, the Malayan Chinese Association, and representatives of other political parties and organizations, delivered speeches at the meeting demanding independence.

According to Singapore newspapers, the mass meeting was disrupted, and the speaker's platform was destroyed. On the same evening, the Singapore "Movement Committee of All Political Parties for Singapore Independence" issued a statement saying that the bloodshed at the mass meeting "was caused by a small number of hooligans, and we strongly condemn this attempt to deliberately sabotage the independence movement."

The day before, the Singapore Labor Front, the People's Action Party, and the Singapore branch of the United Malays National Organisation held separate mass meetings to fight for independence. Each of these mass meetings was attended by two to three thousand people. The political parties also sent representatives to attend these mass meetings. Party leaders who spoke at the meetings expressed their determination to fight for independence and support the Singapore delegation to the UK for negotiations.

Trade Unions Unite
The All-Singapore Trade Union Independence Movement Congress was held on March 17. This was an action by Singapore trade unions to unite and carry out the struggle for Singapore's independence. More than 400 representatives from 102 trade unions with 150,000 members participated in this congress.

The congress unanimously resolved to actively participate in the movement for Singapore's independence and to support the delegation that will go to London in April to negotiate with the United Kingdom on Singapore's political status.

Demand to End the Malayan War
According to a report in the Singapore newspaper on March 20, the Chairman of the Malayan People's Party, Boestamam, recently told newspaper reporters that the best way to end the Malayan War is for the Federation of Malaya government and the Malayan Communist Party to hold negotiations with mutual concessions. Recognizing the Malayan Communist Party as a legitimate political party would bring peace to Malaya.

Boestamam also believes that a country's independence should include political, economic, military, and cultural aspects.

Tsang Ngi Chin, the leader of the Malacca local organization of the Malayan Labour Party, told the press on March 18 that whether the Malayan War can be ended completely depends on whether the Malayan government is sincere in accepting the demands of the Malayan Communist Party. He said: If the Malayan government does not recognize the Malayan Communist Party as a legal political party in time, it will fall into the trap of colonialism and narrow nationalism.

Tsang Ngi Chin also expressed his support for the idea of establishing friendly relations between Malaya and New China.

Signature Campaign in Full Swing
The Singapore "Movement Committee of All Political Parties for Singapore Independence" issued a statement on March 19 saying: "Since the launch of Independence Movement Week, the strength of the independence movement has been growing stronger day by day due to the enthusiastic support of the people of Singapore. With the support of the people, the signature campaign will be carried out more actively and will not end until the end of March."

    新加坡人民争取独立的斗争
    争取独立的群众大会
    新加坡居民五万多人三月十八日在新加坡加冷机场举行了规模巨大的群众大会，要求结束马来亚的殖民统治和马上给予新加坡独立。
    大会是由新加坡“各政党争取新加坡独立运动委员会”发起的，并且得到新加坡各工会和群众团体的支持。参加这个大会的群众情绪非常热烈，他们高呼“我们要求马上独立！”、“结束殖民主义！”
    新加坡首席部长、劳工阵线代表马歇尔，自由社会党、马来民族联合机构新加坡分部、人民行动党和马华公会的代表，以及另外一些政党和团体的代表，都在大会上发表了要求独立的演说。
    据新加坡报纸报道，群众大会遭到了破坏，大会的演讲台被捣毁。当天晚上，新加坡“各政党争取新加坡独立运动委员会”发表声明说，群众大会上发生的流血事件，“是由少数流氓所造成的，我们对这种故意破坏独立运动的企图，严加谴责”。
    前一天，新加坡劳工阵线、人民行动党和马来亚民族联合机构新加坡分部分别举行了争取独立的群众大会。这些群众大会每一个都有二、三千人参加。各政党还互相派遣代表出席这些群众大会。在会上发言的政党领袖们都表示坚决争取独立和支持新加坡赴英国谈判代表团。
    工会团结起来了
    三月十七日举行了全新加坡工会独立运动代表大会。这是新加坡工会团结起来进行争取新加坡独立的斗争的一个行动。参加这个大会的有102个工会十五万会员的四百多个代表。
    代表大会一致决议积极参加争取新加坡独立的运动、支持四月间到伦敦同英国进行关于新加坡政治地位谈判的代表团。
    要求结束马来亚战争
    据新加坡报纸三月二十日报道，马来亚人民党主席波伊斯塔曼最近对报纸记者发表谈话说，结束马来亚战争的最好办法是马来亚联合邦政府和马来亚共产党在互让的态度下举行谈判。承认马来亚共产党为合法的政党，就可以为马来亚带来和平。
    波伊斯塔曼还认为，一个国家的独立应该包括政治、经济、军事、文化等方面。
    马来亚劳工党马六甲地方组织领导人曾汝钦三月十八日对报界发表谈话说，马来亚战争之能否结束，完全要看马来亚政府是否有诚意接受马来亚共产党的要求而定。他说：马来亚政府目前若不及时承认马来亚共产党为合法政党，就将会陷入殖民主义和狭隘民族主义的圈套中。
    曾汝钦还表示支持关于马来亚同新中国建立友好关系的意见。
    签名运动在积极进行
    新加坡“各政党争取新加坡独立运动委员会”在三月十九日发表声明说：“自从独立运动周开展以来，因为得到新加坡人民的热烈拥护，独立运动的力量已经日益强大。在人民的支持下，签名运动将更积极地进行，直到三月底才结束”。
