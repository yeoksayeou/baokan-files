Happy Marriage and Family in the New Society
Yà Nán

In our lives, the old and decaying things are dying and have been dying; new things are constantly appearing and growing. This is also reflected in people's marriage and family life. The arranged and mercenary marriages and feudal families, with the elimination of the feudal social system, have been destroyed and are being destroyed; the new type of families with equality between men and women, mutual respect and love, care for the old and young, and unity in production, with the development of socialist undertakings, are increasing in large numbers and constantly growing.

Whether you go to the countryside or factories, when you ask young men and women what kind of partner they would like to find, they always say to you: "Labor comes first!" Then they talk about the conditions of seeking progress and studying hard. These conditions reflect the fundamental change in the marriage views of young people. Today, young men and women have the right to choose the person they love. They help and encourage each other in production, labor, and learning, and establish true love with each other.

Take a remote mountain village—Qiaomai Chuan Village in Hunyuan County, Shanxi Province—as an example. For many years, people called Qiaomai Chuan the "Beggar's Village" and the people of Qiaomai Chuan the "Poor Mountain Men." The girls of this village want to go down the mountain, and the girls from the bottom of the river don't want to go up the mountain. There are more than 70 bachelors in the whole village of 90 households. Since the collectivization of the whole village in 1954, the "Beggar's Village" has become a rich mountain village. The girls of this village love their home. 社员Lei Zuo Han's family was very poor, and he was not good-looking. Everyone was worried that he would not be able to find a partner. But he worked hard, so he was loved by Liu Yuying, a beautiful and capable member of the Communist Youth League. Liu Yuying firmly rejected the in-laws her father found for her who had cars, horses, and houses, and married Lei Zuo Han. She said: "First, I love Lei Zuo Han for his good work, and second, I love Qiaomai Chuan for its future."

Before liberation, Shengdong Township in Wujin County, Jiangsu Province, like other places, had widespread family discord among farmers. Women were often beaten and scolded. Of the 20 households in Huangdun Village, 19 beat their wives, and only one did not, because the husband was a fool. Wives had no status in the family, eating leftovers and cold dishes, and it was rare to add a new piece of clothing in 10 or 8 years. But now everything is different. In the 9 teams of the Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative in this township, 96 of the 97 women participated in labor. Some women also served as deputy directors of the cooperative, members of the cooperative affairs committee, and deputy captains of production teams. Due to the change of the economic system, due to the participation of women in labor, they gradually got rid of their subordinate status and were generally respected in society and at home. Wives eat the same food as their parents-in-law and husbands, making clothes is planned by the family as a whole, and daily pocket money is also provided by the family. Women have the right to participate in giving opinions on handling family affairs and production issues. They can freely participate in social activities. Li Yueqi, the deputy director of this cooperative, has a family of 11: an old couple, 4 sons, 3 daughters-in-law, and two grandchildren. The old father is the leader of the whole family, the old mother is in charge of money spending, the 3 daughters-in-law are responsible for bookkeeping, and a family meeting is held every spring and autumn to discuss life and production matters. After the autumn harvest last year, all 3 daughters-in-law made new clothes. The third daughter-in-law is a women's committee member and often goes out to meetings, so she specially made a Lenin-style suit for her. Family members can also use criticism and self-criticism to resolve any disputes.

This new family relationship has gradually become common in rural areas. The more advanced agricultural production cooperatives there are, the more harmonious and happier the family life of the farmers will be.

The change in family relations is also reflected in the families of handicraftsmen who have been organized. For example, in Weifang City, Shandong Province, many women used to participate in auxiliary labor at home, but men always thought that their wives were "supported by me." After participating in the handicraft cooperative, women can earn about 30 yuan a month, and men and parents-in-law have changed their attitude towards them. The husband discusses things with his wife, and the mother-in-law actively helps the daughter-in-law to take care of the children and do housework. Everyone divides the work and cooperates, participates in labor as an equal member, and the enthusiasm for production is getting higher and higher.

Some urban housewives, although they do not directly participate in social labor, under the education of socialist ideology, they carry out housework with new views and new attitudes, and help and encourage their husbands and children to better exert their labor enthusiasm. There are also many housewives who actively participate in various social activities and have done many beneficial things for the masses. Therefore, their status in society and family is also constantly improving. Shen Lao Han, a representative of the People's Congress of Putuo District, Shanghai, enthusiastically participated in neighborhood work after liberation. At first, her husband ridiculed her and said, "You are so busy every day, your salary should be more than mine!" Shen Lao Han carefully and thoughtfully took care of the housework, so that her husband could work with peace of mind, and insisted on participating in various social activities. Because of her hard work and dedication to serving the masses, she was later honorably elected as a representative of the People's Congress of the district. Her husband saw with his own eyes the respect and love of the masses for her, and gradually changed his attitude. Now the couple often study current affairs and discuss work together. Whenever there is a meeting, the husband urges her to go early.

Jiaofang Street in Ganjingzi District, Dalian is a workers' residential area. When people recall the past, it is difficult to count how many families on this street are not noisy. Disputes often occur between workers' families over children, water, electricity, and gas problems, which leads to disunity among employees. Family discord and neighborhood disharmony seriously affect workers' production. Han Zhenyun, the wife of Wang Qingnian, a worker at the Dalian Steel Plant, often beat and scolded her children, and the couple often quarreled about this. Once, Wang Qingnian went to work in a rage, and his attention was not focused at work, which almost caused an accident. Later, in the marriage law movement, the election movement, and the study of the general line, employees and their families understood the significance of improving family relations for production and socialist construction, and many families signed amicable agreements. Employees promised to actively produce, complete and overfulfill production plans; workers' families promised to take good care of their children, cook well, and maintain hygiene, so that workers could eat well, sleep well, attend well, and produce well. Jin Xiumei, who had always been unreasonable to her husband, completely changed her appearance. She cooks on time every day, and the room is cleaned spotlessly; on the days when her husband works the night shift, she takes the children out to play so that he can sleep well during the day. In the past, she always complained that there was not enough money to spend, but last Spring Festival she bought her husband a thick woolen sweater and a leather hat, and also saved money in the bank. Han Zhenyun, who often beat and scolded her children, also changed her attitude towards her children, and assisted Zhao Zinan, the leader of the workers' family mutual aid group, in organizing more than 20 children in the group to play together collectively. Wang Qingnian no longer worried about family affairs, and worked hard in his work, becoming an advanced worker in the factory workshop. The workers' families in Jiaofang Street not only care about their husbands and children, but also care about the factory and all the workers, and care about national affairs. More than 260 women in the whole street participated in cultural and political studies, and more than 240 women became grassroots cadres in the street. Every New Year's Day and holiday, the workers' families help the factory to make flowers and colorful signs, help single workers wash clothes, and take care of their lives.

As we stride towards a socialist society, new marriages, new families, and new moral customs are also growing day by day. This new happy life will also inspire people to engage in the great and heroic socialist construction cause with energetic pleasure!

    新社会幸福的婚姻和家庭
    亚南
    在我们的生活里，旧的和腐朽的东西已经和正在死亡；新的事物在不断出现，不断成长。这表现在人们的婚姻家庭生活中，也是如此。包办买卖婚姻和封建家庭，随着封建社会制度的消灭而被摧毁和正在被摧毁；男女平等、互敬互爱、爱护老幼，团结生产的新型家庭，随着社会主义事业的发展，正在大量地增加和不断地成长。
    不论到农村和工厂，当你问到年青小伙子和姑娘们愿意找个什么样的对象的时候，他们总是对你说：“劳动第一呀！”然后谈到要求进步和努力学习的条件。这些条件，反映了青年人婚姻观点的根本变化。在今天，青年男女都有权选择自己心爱的人。他们在生产劳动和学习中，相互帮助和鼓励，彼此建立真正的爱情。
    就拿一个偏僻的山村——山西省浑源县荞麦川村做例子吧。多少年来，人们把荞麦川叫做“讨吃鬼村”，把荞麦川的人叫做“穷山汉”。本村的姑娘要下山，川下的姑娘不上山，全村90户就有70多个光棍汉。自从1954年全村合作化以后，“讨吃鬼村”变成了富山庄。本村的姑娘爱上自己的家了。社员雷作汉，原先家里很穷，长得又不好看，大家担心他不好找对象。可是他劳动好，于是就被一个又漂亮又能干的青年团员刘玉英爱上了。刘玉英坚决拒绝了父亲给她找的有车有马有房的婆家，和雷作汉结了婚。她说：“我一爱雷作汉劳动好，二爱荞麦川有前途。”
    江苏省武进县胜东乡在解放以前，正如别的地方一样，农民的家庭普遍不和。妇女经常挨打受骂。荒墩村20户人家，19户打老婆，只有一户不打，因为丈夫是个呆子。媳妇在家庭里没有地位，吃的是剩饭冷菜，10年8年难得添一件新衣服。但是现在一切都不同了。这个乡的前进农业生产合作社9个小队中，97个妇女，96人都参加了劳动。有的妇女还担任了副社长、社务委员和生产队的副队长。由于经济制度的改变，由于妇女参加了劳动，她们逐渐摆脱了从属地位，在社会上和家庭里普遍地受到了尊重。媳妇和公婆、丈夫吃一样的饭菜，做衣服由家庭统一筹划，日常零用也是家庭供给。在处理家务和生产问题上，妇女有参加意见的权利。她们可以自由地参加社会活动。这个社的副社长李月七全家大小11口：一对老夫妻、4个儿子、3房儿媳、两个孙子。老父亲是全家的领导人，老母亲管银钱开支，3媳妇负责记账，每逢春秋二季开全家会议，商量生活和生产大事。去年秋收以后，3个媳妇都做了新衣。三媳妇是妇女委员，常出去开会，因此还特地为她做了一件列宁服上装。家庭成员之间碰到有什么纠纷，也能运用批评和自我批评方式来解决。
    这种新的家庭关系，在农村已经逐渐普遍起来。高级农业生产合作社愈多的地区，农民的家庭生活也愈加和睦，愈加幸福。
    家庭关系的改变，同样地表现在已经组织起来的手工业者的家庭里。如山东省潍坊市，许多妇女过去在家庭里也参加辅助劳动，但是男人们却总认为老婆是“靠我养活的”。及至参加了手工业合作社以后，妇女每月可以挣到30元左右的工资，男人和公婆便改变了对待她们的态度。丈夫遇事和老婆商量，婆婆主动地帮助媳妇带孩子，做家务。大家分工合作，以平等的一员共同参加劳动，生产积极性也愈来愈高了。
    一些城市中的家庭妇女，虽然没有直接参加社会劳动，但是在社会主义思想的教育下，她们以新的观点、新的态度进行家务劳动，帮助和鼓励了丈夫和儿女们更好地发挥劳动积极性。还有很多家庭妇女，积极地参加了各种社会活动，为群众做了不少有益的事情。因而她们在社会上和家庭中的地位也不断提高。上海市普陀区区人民代表沈老汉，解放后她热情地参加了里弄工作。开始丈夫还讽刺她说：“你天天这样忙，工钱该比我的多吧！”沈老汉一面细心周到地料理家务，使丈夫安心生产，一面坚持地参加各项社会活动。由于她任劳任怨地为群众服务，后来光荣地被选为区人民代表。她的丈夫亲眼看到群众对她的尊重和爱戴，也逐渐改变了态度。现在夫妇俩常常一块儿学习时事，讨论工作。每当开会的时候，丈夫还催着她早点去。
    大连甘井子区椒房街是工人住宅区，当人们回忆过去的情况的时候，很难数得出这条街上有几家是不吵不闹的。工属之间，为了孩子和用水用电和瓦斯问题也经常发生纠纷，以致职工之间也不团结。家庭不和，邻里不睦，严重地影响了工人生产。大连钢厂工人王清年的老婆韩贞云，经常打骂孩子，夫妻俩为此经常吵架。有一次，王清年生着气去上班，工作中注意力不集中，险些造成事故。后来在贯彻婚姻法运动、普选运动，以及在总路线的学习中，职工和家属们懂得了搞好家庭关系对于生产和社会主义建设的意义，许多家庭都订了和睦公约。职工们保证积极生产，完成和超额完成生产计划；工属们保证带好孩子，做好饭，搞好卫生，使工人吃得好、睡得好、出勤好、生产好。一向和丈夫无理取闹的金秀梅，也完全变了样。她每天按时做好饭，房里收拾得干干净净；丈夫作夜班的日子，她就把孩子抱出去玩，让他白天好好睡眠。过去她老闹着钱不够花，去年春节竟给丈夫买了一套厚厚的绒衣裤和一顶皮帽子，而且还在银行里存了钱。经常打骂孩子的韩贞云，也改变了对待孩子的态度，并且协助工属互助组组长赵子南，把全组20几个孩子都组织起来，在一起集体游玩。王清年不耽心家务了，在工作中努力钻研，成了工厂车间的先进工作者。椒房街的工属们，不但关心自己的丈夫和孩子，而且关心着工厂和全体工人，关心着国家大事。全街260多个妇女参加了文化和政治学习，240多个妇女成了街道的基层干部。每逢过年、过节，工属们便帮助工厂扎花、扎彩牌，帮助单身工人洗衣服，照管他们的生活。
    当我们大踏步地走向社会主义社会的时候，新的婚姻、新的家庭、新的道德风尚，也正在一天天成长起来。这种新的幸福的生活，又将鼓舞着人们精力充沛地愉快地去从事伟大而豪迈的社会主义建设事业！
