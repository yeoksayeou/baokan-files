The Children's Toy Exhibition Hall opened in Beijing on the 20th. Approximately two thousand domestic and foreign children's toys are on display here.

Domestic toys are exhibited in five units. In the folk toy section, you can see a variety of toys with simple styles and beautiful images, including shadow puppets, clay and straw woven toys, entertainment and sports toys such as kaleidoscopes and diablos, as well as wooden spinning wheels from Wenzhou, Zhejiang. Their characteristics are that they are made from local materials and are inexpensive.

Toys made from waste materials by early childhood educators are on display here. These include "The Story of the Three Bears," "Pulling the Radish," and "The Story of the Golden Rooster and the Fox." These toys reflect the creativity of the early childhood educators and their love for children.

Commonly available commercial toys are displayed in three sections according to the age characteristics of children: infancy and pre-school period (newborn to three years old) toys, pre-school age (three to seven years old) toys, and school age (seven to fifteen years old) toys. A few bad toys are also placed here for the audience to criticize.

In the foreign toy section, toys from the Soviet Union and many People's Democratic countries are on display, as well as toys from India, Japan, the United Kingdom, West Germany, Sweden, Norway, Belgium, Canada, Brazil, and other countries.

    儿童玩具陈列馆在京开幕
    儿童玩具陈列馆二十日在京开幕，这里共陈列了国内外儿童玩具约两千件。
    国内玩具共分五个单元展出。在民间玩具部分，可以看到各种各样风格纯朴、形象优美的玩具，皮影戏的，泥制、草编的，望花筒、空竹一类娱乐体育性的，还有浙江温州的木雕纺车等等。它们的特点是就地取材、价格低廉。
    幼教工作者们利用废物制做的玩具在这里陈列着。里面有“三只熊的故事”、“拔萝卜”、“金冠鸡和狐狸的故事”等，这些玩具反映了幼教工作者们的创造性和她们热爱孩子的心情。
    市场上常见的商品玩具，根据儿童年龄的特点分作婴儿期及先学前期（初生到三岁）玩具、学龄前期（三到七岁）玩具和学龄期（七到十五岁）玩具三部分陈列着。少数坏的玩具也摆在这里让观众批判。
    外国玩具部分，陈列着来自苏联和许多人民民主国家的，还陈列着来自印度、日本、英国、西德、瑞典、挪威、比利时、加拿大、巴西等国的。
