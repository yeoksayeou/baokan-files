    The Urgent Task of Enterprise Leaders

    Following the high tide of agricultural cooperativization and the socialist transformation of private industry, commerce, and handicrafts, a mass-based production upsurge is also taking shape on the industrial and transportation fronts. Since January of this year, in many enterprises in many cities, the broad masses of workers, in a spirit of criticism and self-criticism, have proactively planned work, improved production, and learned and applied advanced experiences. They have put forward thousands of criticisms and suggestions for improving the work of enterprise leaders and various aspects of the enterprise. In many enterprises, the rationalization proposals put forward by the workers in a few days far exceeded the rationalization proposals put forward in the past year. In these enterprises, production efficiency has increased many times over, and quotas have been broken one after another. Those who were originally backward are actively learning from advanced producers, and the advanced are becoming even more advanced. After mass discussions, the state plan exceeded the original control figures in all its indicators. Inter-factory competitions among similar factories and competitions among workers of the same type have been widely launched. Thousands of enterprises and tens of thousands of workers, technicians, and managers have actively participated in the competitions.

    The Party, administrative, Communist Youth League, and trade union organizations in enterprises should welcome this production upsurge, which is taking shape on the industrial and transportation fronts, and the socialist enthusiasm shown by the broad masses of workers to complete the 1956 plan and the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, with the greatest enthusiasm and the most positive attitude.

    However, when millions of people act with revolutionary spirit, many new problems also arise for the leaders. For example, the balance between various production units and processes within the enterprise is broken; the supply of raw materials and cooperative products is out of sync; the usual procedures for preparing plans and the procedures and methods for approving and handling rationalization proposals can no longer fully meet the requirements of the objective situation; the old, unreasonable wage and reward systems have also fallen behind the development of production and cannot meet the current needs. These problems are forcing enterprise leaders to solve them quickly, thus bringing many difficulties to enterprise leaders. However, it should also be recognized that these difficulties are difficulties under normal circumstances, difficulties brought about by the leap forward in productivity, and overcoming these difficulties is necessary to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and accelerate the pace of industrialization. Therefore, enterprise leaders should actively and happily overcome these difficulties; they must stand in front of the masses and correctly guide the masses of workers forward.

    Of course, leading the masses in production movements is not an easy task. We know that the transformation of production relations, after the conditions are met, can be basically resolved quickly in the high tide of the mass movement. The great victory we achieved not long ago in the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce was like that. The increase in productivity must go through a series of meticulous and complex tasks, constantly improving business management, and constantly improving labor productivity. This basic situation determines that enterprise leaders must lead the high production enthusiasm of the masses in the industrial and transportation sectors in this way: to make it develop steadily and lastingly, rather than sweeping past like a gust of wind.

    In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to seek appropriate forms to organize the enthusiasm of the masses. If it is allowed to drift, it will not last. Now, this form has already appeared in practical work. This is to widely carry out the advanced producer movement and the inter-factory competition of similar enterprises and the competition of the same type of work based on intra-factory competition. Through this form, the masses can always maintain a high and full spirit, constantly put forward new and higher goals of struggle, and constantly and proactively learn and apply advanced experience, and constantly put forward opinions and rationalization proposals for reforming production. If this form is used well, the industrial and transportation sectors will always boil with a surging and vibrant production upsurge.

    After organizing the enthusiasm of the masses, it is also necessary to constantly point out the direction for them so that they can move in unison and achieve great results. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao instructed us to carry out socialist construction in a way that is more, faster, better, and more economical. This is the general direction. But at present, when the attention of the masses of workers is focused on breaking quotas, improving efficiency, and increasing output, enterprise leaders should pay more attention to guiding the high enthusiasm of the masses to "better" and "more economical" in a timely manner, especially to improving product quality. Because poor product quality is one of the fundamental problems in China's industry at present. The product quality of some heavy industries is not up to standard, which affects the progress of the national construction cause and the improvement of the industrial level; the product quality of some light industries is not good, which not only cannot meet the needs of the people, but also accumulates national funds, or shortens the service life, causing social waste. This shows that if the quality is not guaranteed, it is meaningless to speed up and increase output; poor quality will even directly affect the growth of output and speed. Therefore, improving product quality should become the main task of the industrial and transportation sectors at present. Enterprise leaders should guide the enthusiasm of the masses to this aspect, mobilize them to put forward rationalization proposals for improving quality, organize them to learn and apply advanced experience in improving quality, focus on rewarding advanced individuals and advanced units that have achieved results in improving quality, and first specify quality indicators in the evaluation conditions of the competition. It is necessary to organize technicians and workers to use collective wisdom to study and solve the key issues of improving quality. It is necessary to strengthen the work of design, technology, inspection and other departments that are important to ensuring and improving product quality, and pay special attention to giving play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the staff in these departments.

    Increasing variety, ensuring the completion and striving to complete the state's new product trial production plan ahead of schedule is also an extremely important task. Whether it is light industrial products or heavy industrial products, only by constantly increasing new varieties can we meet the needs of social production development and people's lives. The speed of variety increase largely determines the speed of industrial production growth. In particular, heavy industrial products, if they cannot complete the trial production and production plan of new products in accordance with national requirements, will directly affect the development of the national economy. Therefore, enterprise leaders must also pay close attention to guiding the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses to the task of trial production and production of new products.

    Reducing costs, saving raw materials, and striving to accumulate more funds are also fundamental tasks in China's industrial construction. At present, some enterprises have already experienced the tendency to blindly hoard too much raw materials for the sake of "more" and "faster"; some machinery factories, in order to pursue output value, invest materials without regard to the number of sets, and invest in whatever parts have more materials, resulting in incomplete sets of parts and increased reserves of semi-finished products. These practices are harmful to the comprehensive completion of the plan. Enterprise leaders must prevent and correct this incorrect practice of not paying attention to conservation and one-sidedly pursuing output value and quantity, and deviating from the track of the national plan.

    Eliminating backward links, making backward links catch up with advanced levels, and promoting the advanced to move forward is the constant and basic responsibility of leaders. The mass-based industrial production upsurge that is taking shape has created particularly favorable conditions for doing this. The backwardness in China's enterprises is manifested in two aspects: technology and management. And now the masses have never had such a high degree of initiative in breaking through old quotas and changing backward technological rules; the enthusiasm for learning and applying advanced experience, and the demand for reforming unreasonable management systems in enterprises that restrict the development of productive forces have never been so urgent as they are now. This is a very huge driving force. Enterprise leaders should seize these favorable conditions, give full play to the enthusiasm and initiative of the masses, encourage and support the advanced, give specific help to the backward, and lead all employees to learn from the experience of advanced enterprises, use the revolutionary spirit of the masses to improve various technical and economic quotas, revise technological rules, systematically and comprehensively improve the management of enterprises and improve the technical level of enterprises, and constantly make the backward links catch up quickly, and make the advanced links break through the old balance and move forward.

    To actively and correctly lead the industrial production upsurge that is taking shape, to keep the enthusiasm of the masses constant and lasting, to significantly improve the output and quality of industrial products during this upsurge, to make the backward universally catch up with the level of the advanced, and to combine the improvement of production and the safety of production operation with the improvement of the living and welfare of employees, this is the urgent task of enterprise leaders at present.

    企业领导者的迫切任务
    继农业合作化的高潮和私营工商业、手工业社会主义改造的高潮之后，工业运输战线上群众性的生产高潮也正在形成中。从今年1月份以来，许多城市的许多企业中，广大职工以批评和自我批评的精神，主动地规划工作，改进生产，学习和运用先进经验。他们对企业领导和企业中各方面的工作，提出了千百条的批评和改进工作的意见。许多企业的职工在几天之中提出的合理化建议，大大超过了过去一年提出的合理化建议。在这些企业中，生产效率成倍地提高，定额纷纷被突破；原来落后的人积极地向先进生产者看齐，先进的变得更加先进。国家计划经过群众讨论，各项指标都超过了原来的控制数字。同类工厂的厂际竞赛和同工种竞赛广泛展开了，上千个企业，成千成万个工人、技术人员和管理人员，都积极地参加了竞赛。
    对于这个正在形成中的工业运输战线上的生产高潮，对职工群众为提前完成1956年计划和第一个五年计划所表现的这种社会主义积极性，企业中的党、行政、青年团、工会组织，应当以最大的热情、最积极的态度来欢迎它。
    但是，当千百万群众以革命的精神行动起来的时候，在领导者面前，也出现许多新的问题。例如，企业内部各个生产单位和各工序之间的平衡关系被打破了；原材料和协作产品的供应出现了脱节现象；通常编制计划的程序和对合理化建议的审批手续和处理方法，已不能完全适应客观形势的要求了；旧的不合理的工资制度和奖励制度，也落在生产发展的后面，不能适应当前的需要。这些问题都迫使着企业领导者必须迅速地加以解决，从而给企业的领导者带来了许多困难。但是，也应当认识到：这种困难是正常情况下的困难，是生产力的跃进所带来的困难，克服这些困难，是提前完成五年计划和加快工业化速度所必需的。因此，企业的领导者应当积极地、愉快地去克服这些困难；必须站在群众的前面，正确地引导职工群众前进。
    当然，领导群众的生产运动，并不是一件轻而易举的事。我们知道，生产关系的变革，在条件具备以后，可以在群众运动的高潮中迅速求得基本解决。不久以前，我们在农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造中所取得的伟大胜利，就是那样。而生产力的提高，就必须经过一系列细致复杂的工作，不断改进经营管理，不断提高劳动生产率。这个基本情况就决定了企业的领导者必须这样来领导工业运输部门中群众高涨的生产积极性：使它巩固地、持久地向前发展，而不是像一阵风似地刮过去。
    为了达到这个目的，需要寻求恰当的形式把群众的积极性组织起来。如果听其自流，就不能持久。现在，这种形式在实际工作当中已经出现了。这就是广泛开展先进生产者运动和以厂内竞赛为基础的同类企业的厂际竞赛和同工种竞赛。通过这种形式，可以使群众一直保持高涨的饱满的情绪，不断提出新的更高的奋斗目标，并且经常不断地主动地学习和运用先进经验，经常不断地提出改革生产的意见和合理化建议。很好地运用这种形式，就会在工业运输部门当中经常沸腾着澎湃的、充满着生命力的生产高潮。
    把群众的积极性组织起来以后，还必须不断给他们指出方向，这样才能步调齐一，收效宏大。党中央和毛主席指示我们，要又多、又快、又好、又省地进行社会主义建设。这就是总的方向。但是在目前职工群众的注意力集中在突破定额、提高效率、增加产量的时候，企业领导者更应当注意适时地把群众高涨的积极性引导到“好”和“省”，特别是提高产品质量方面来。因为产品质量不好，是目前我国工业中的根本问题之一。有些重工业的产品质量不够标准，影响着国家建设事业的进行和工业水平的提高；有些轻工业的产品质量不好，既不能满足人民需要，又积压了国家资金，或者使用寿命缩短，造成了社会性的浪费。这说明如果质量没有保证，尽管加快速度和增加产量，都是没有什么意义的；质量不好，甚而会直接影响产量和速度的增长。因此，提高产品质量，应当成为目前工业运输部门的主要任务。企业的领导者应当把群众的积极性引导到这方面来，发动他们提出改善质量的合理化建议，组织他们学习和运用提高质量的先进经验，着重奖励提高质量有成绩的先进人物和先进单位，竞赛的评比条件中首先要规定质量指标。要组织技术人员和工人用集体的智慧来研究解决提高质量的关键问题。要加强对保证和提高产品质量关系重大的设计、工艺、检验等部门的工作，特别注意发挥这些部门中工作人员的积极性和创造性。
    增加品种，保证完成和争取提前完成国家的新产品试制计划，也是一项极为重要的任务。无论轻工业产品或重工业产品，只有不断增加新品种，才能适应社会生产发展和人民生活的需要。品种增加得快慢，在很大程度上决定工业生产增长的快慢。特别是重工业产品，如果不能按照国家要求完成新产品试制和生产计划，将直接影响国民经济的发展。因此，企业的领导者也必须十分注意把群众的积极性和创造性引导到试制和生产新产品的任务上来。
    降低成本，节约原材料，努力积累更多的资金，同样是我国工业建设中的根本性任务。现在有些企业已经发生了为了“多”和“快”而盲目地过多地储备原材料的偏向；有的机械工厂为了追求产值，投料不按台份，那种零件的材料多就投那种，结果零件不成套，增加了半成品的储备量。这些做法对全面完成计划都是有害的。企业领导者必须防止和纠正这种不注意节约和片面地追求产值、追求数量，脱离国家计划轨道的不正确做法。
    消除落后环节，使落后环节赶上先进水平，推动先进的更向前进，这是领导者经常的基本职责。正在形成中的群众性的工业生产高潮，给做到这一点创造了特别有利的条件。我国企业中的落后，不外表现在技术和管理两方面。而现在群众对突破旧定额、改变落后的工艺规程，从来没有过这样高度的主动精神；学习和运用先进经验的积极性，要求改革企业中限制生产力发挥的不合理的管理制度，也从来没有现在这样迫切。这是一个十分巨大的推动力量。企业的领导者正应当紧紧抓住这些有利条件，充分发挥群众的积极性和主动性，鼓励和支持先进者，给落后者以具体的帮助，带动全体职工，学习先进企业的经验，利用群众的革命精神，来提高各种技术经济定额，修订工艺规程，系统地、全面地改善企业的管理工作和提高企业的技术水平，不断地使落后环节迅速赶上去，使先进环节突破旧有的平衡，更向前进。
    对正在形成中的工业生产高潮进行积极的、正确的领导，使群众的热烈情绪保持经常和持久，使工业品的产量和质量在这个高潮当中都得到显著的提高，使落后者普遍赶上先进者的水平，使生产的提高和生产运转的安全，同职工生活福利的改善结合起来，这就是企业领导者当前的迫切任务。
