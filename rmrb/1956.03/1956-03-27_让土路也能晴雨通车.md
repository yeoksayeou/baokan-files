Make Dirt Roads Passable in All Weather
Wang Liang, Deputy Director of the Shandong Provincial Department of Transportation

Of the 8,459 kilometers of roads open to traffic in Shandong Province, 94.7% are natural dirt roads without any pavement. The loose soil on these natural dirt roads is 20 centimeters thick. On sunny days, dust flies everywhere, and the road surface is uneven, so vehicles can only travel at a speed of about 15 kilometers per hour. Gasoline consumption is very high, and the wear and tear on machinery and tires is also alarming. On rainy days, the roads turn into mud, and vehicles have difficulty passing. Sometimes, passengers spend all their travel money waiting for a bus, and the weather still doesn't clear up. Due to poor road conditions, vehicle operating efficiency is low, and materials are often backlogged. The situation becomes even more serious during the rainy season.

In the past, the leaders of the Shandong Provincial Department of Transportation and the staff of the highway departments believed that only large-scale investment by the state could fundamentally change the road transportation situation. After studying the Party's general line for the transition period, we realized that it is impossible and undesirable to ask the state to make large-scale investments in local transportation at present. The rapid increase in transport volume also forced us to find solutions ourselves. From then on, we began to look not only upward but mainly downward.

During our inspection, we found that a section of the Yan (tai) - Wei (fang) Road in Doyang Village, Shahe, had a very solid road surface of several tens of meters. Vehicles could travel on it in rainy weather, and mules and horses did not leave hoof marks. We studied the soil composition of this section of the road and found that it was a mixture of sand and clay. Therefore, we summoned the road maintenance teams in this area to visit and asked them to find the same kind of soil to experiment with, and the results were very good. Then, we arranged for road maintenance teams in Jiaozhou and Changyi to conduct the same experiment, and the results were also very good. In order to promote this experience, we held a provincial road maintenance conference. At the conference, we commended the pilot work of Shahe, Jiaozhou, and Changyi, and gave a report on the improvements made to the road surface. However, some staff members still did not believe in these experiences, thinking that a dirt road is always a dirt road and cannot be transformed. After the meeting, we sent people to Luxi, Lunan, and Ludong to inspect and assist the road maintenance teams in summarizing their experiences and improving their work. We found that a small section of road surface improved with weathered stone by Huang Zhaorui of the Feixian Road Maintenance Team in Lunan was very solid and smooth, and could be used in all weather; a section improved with clay by the Tancheng Station was not bad either; and a section improved with sandy shale by the Zhucheng Station could also be used in all weather. After summarizing the experiences created by the masses, we organized a road surface improvement observation group in the spring of 1954, composed of responsible persons from various sections and stations, to promote advanced experiences through observation, research, and practice. After returning, the observers came up with many methods based on the principle of relying on the masses and using local materials. For example, because Yangjiaogou is close to the sea, the workers used clay mixed with seawater to improve the road surface, with good results. The workers in the Sunjiatan section of the Yan (tai) - Wei (haiwei) Road also used seawater sand and gravel to improve the road surface, and it could also be used in rainy weather. Farmers in Heze County used waste soil discarded from saltpeter production to improve the road surface, and Penglai County used shells mixed with clay to improve the road surface, all with good results.

Large-scale work to improve dirt roads began. From the beginning of the pilot program in 1953 to the third quarter of 1955, a total of 1,058 kilometers of dirt roads were improved throughout the province. The general standard for improvement is a width of 3.5 meters and a compacted thickness of 6-15 centimeters. The cost of improving the road surface with clay or saline soil is generally 600 yuan per kilometer, while the cost of improving it with a mixture of sand, gravel, and clay, or with gravel and weathered stone, is about 900 yuan per kilometer. All improved road sections generally have a smooth and solid surface, are durable, and have increased load-bearing capacity. The average driving speed has generally increased to 40-50 kilometers per hour. Road surfaces made of cohesive soil or saline soil can be opened to traffic one day after heavy rain or five hours after light rain; road surfaces made of coarse sand, gravel, or weathered stone can be opened to traffic as soon as the rain stops, and some sections can be used in all weather. Gasoline consumption has been reduced by 11.8% compared to before the improvement, steel plate damage has been reduced by 90% compared to before the improvement, the rate of wear and tear on machinery and tires has also been greatly reduced, labor productivity has increased by 6 times, costs have been reduced by 50%, vehicle tonnage per month has increased by one time, and accidents are also rare.

In order to support agricultural production and industrial construction, we will guarantee to redouble our efforts in the future. From 1956 to 1957, we will improve another 1,500 kilometers of dirt roads through maintenance methods. By 1962, we can have 10,000 kilometers of roads that can be used in all weather.

    让土路也能晴雨通车
    山东省交通厅副厅长　王亮
    山东省境内原有通车公路8，459公里，其中没有路面的天然土路占94.7％。这些天然土路路面的浮土有二十公分厚，晴天尘土飞扬，加之路面坑洼不平，车速每小时只有十五公里左右，汽油消耗很大，机件、轮胎的消耗也非常惊人。雨天，公路变成一片泥塘，车子很难通行。有的时候，旅客为了等车，把路费吃光了，天还不放晴。由于路坏，车辆运转效率低，物资经常被积压。一到雨季，情况就更为严重。
    山东省交通厅领导上和公路部门的工作人员，过去认为除非国家大量投资才能根本改变公路运输情况。学习了党在过渡时期的总路线以后，我们知道要求国家目前在地方交通上作大量投资是不可能的，也是不应该的。而运输量的急剧增加，也逼得自己要设法解决。从此，我们的目光就不只朝上面看，而主要转向了下面。
    我们在检查工作中，发现烟（台）潍（坊）路沙河段大杨村地方有几十公尺的路面非常坚实，雨天可以行车，骡马走过不留蹄痕。我们就研究了这一段路面的土壤成分，发现里面是沙和粘土。于是，我们就召集这一地段的道班来参观，要他们找同样的土壤来作试验，效果很好。接着，我们又布置胶州、昌邑地段的道班作同样试验，效果也很好。为了推广这一经验，我们召开了全省养路会议，在会上表扬了沙河、胶州和昌邑的试点工作，并且在大会上做了改善路面经过的报告。但是，有些工作人员还不相信这些经验，认为土路总是土路，变不出什么来。会后，我们又派人到鲁西、鲁南、鲁东等地去检查和协助各道班总结经验，改进工作。我们发现鲁南费县道班黄兆瑞用风化石改善的一小段路面非常坚实平整，可以晴雨通车；郯城车站用粘土改善的一段路也不坏；诸城车站用砂羌石改善的一段路也可以晴雨通车。我们把群众创造的经验加以总结以后，于1954年春调各段站负责人组成改善土路观摩团，用边看边研究边实习的办法推广先进经验。观摩的人回去后，根据依靠群众就地取材的原则，又想出许多办法。如羊角沟因靠近海边，工人们便用粘土混合海水改善路面，效果很好。烟（台）威（海卫）路孙家滩段的工人们也用海水砂石改善路面，雨天也能通车。菏泽县农民用煎硝盐弃置的废土改善路面，蓬莱县用贝壳混合粘土改善路面，效果都很好。
    大规模的改善土路工作开始了。自1953年开始试点至1955年第三季度止，全省共计改善了土路1，058公里。改善的标准，一般为宽3.5公尺，压实厚度六—十五公分不等。用粘土或盐渍土改善的路面成本，一般每公里六百元，用砂砾、粘土混合料及砾石风化石改善的，每公里约合九百元。所有改善的路段，一般是路面平整坚实，经久耐用，提高了承载力，行车时速普遍提高到四十—五十公里。用粘性土或盐渍土的路面，大雨后一天，小雨后五小时即可通车；用粗砂、砾石、风化石的路面，雨停即可通车，有些路段并且能晴雨通车。汽油消耗量较改善前降低了11.8％，钢版的损坏比改善前减少90％，机件和轮胎的损耗率也大大降低了，劳动生产率提高6倍，成本降低50％，车吨月产量提高了一倍，事故也不多见了。
    为了支援农业生产和工业建设，今后我们保证加倍努力，从1956年到1957年两年内，通过养护办法，再改善一千五百公里的土路，到1962年，可以有一万公里的公路能晴雨通车。
