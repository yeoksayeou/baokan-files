Yunnan province has begun sowing two seasons of flue-cured tobacco. The province will plant 800,000 mu of flue-cured tobacco. Yuxi Prefecture, the main producing area of flue-cured tobacco, will plant 388,000 mu of flue-cured tobacco this year, an increase of 170% over the sown area last year.

In order not to occupy grain planting area and affect grain production increase, Yuxi Prefecture plans to reclaim 345,000 mu of wasteland, of which 80% of the reclaimed land will be used for planting flue-cured tobacco; and 80,000 mu of double-season flue-cured tobacco will be planted in Chengjiang, Jinning and other counties. In Jiangchuan County, one of the main producing areas of Yuxi Prefecture, more than 44,000 mu were planted last year, with an average yield of 249 jin per mu. This year, the sown area will be doubled, of which 20,000 mu will be planted with double-season flue-cured tobacco. Now the county's tobacco fields have been tidied up; some townships have already sown seeds.

    云南今年将种烤烟80万亩
    云南省两季烤烟已经开始播种。全省将种植烤烟80万亩。烤烟的主要产地玉溪专区今年种植烤烟388，000亩，比去年播种面积增加170％。
    为了不占粮食种植面积、影响粮食增产，玉溪全区计划开荒345，000亩，其中所开荒地的80％的土地用作种植烤烟；并在澄江、晋宁等县种植双季烤烟8万亩。在玉溪专区主要产区之一的江川县，去年种了44，000余亩，每亩平均收了249市斤。今年将播种面积扩大了一倍，其中有2万亩种植双季烤烟，现在全县烟田已经整理完毕；有的乡已经撒下了种籽。
