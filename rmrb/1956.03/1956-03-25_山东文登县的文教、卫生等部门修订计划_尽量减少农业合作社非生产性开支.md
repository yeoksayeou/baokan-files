Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 24th – The Wenjiao (Culture and Education), Health, Post and Telecommunications and other departments of Wendeng County, Shandong Province, have recently corrected the phenomenon of demanding too much and too highly from agricultural production cooperatives in running cultural and welfare undertakings, resulting in increased non-productive expenditures.

These departments, in their work, disregarded the actual capabilities of the agricultural production cooperatives and put forward many excessive demands. For example, the County Culture and Education Section demanded that 150 primary schools be transferred to be run by agricultural production cooperatives in the first half of this year; when the Xinhua Bookstore promoted books and periodicals to the cooperatives, it demanded that they buy as many as possible; the health department required each production team to buy a health care kit this spring, each kit equipped with more than 16 yuan worth of medicines; the post and telecommunications bureau planned to set up postmen in each township by the end of April, with wages borne by the agricultural production cooperatives, and also required each cooperative to prepay 10 yuan to purchase stamps.

As a result, the agricultural production cooperatives increased many non-productive expenditures. The Dengta Agricultural Production Cooperative planned to spend more than 11,600 yuan on culture, health and other welfare undertakings this year. The Qinjian Agricultural Production Cooperative purchased more than 110 yuan worth of books at one time. Some members of the cooperatives said: "These things are all good, but the cooperative is just starting, and the foundation is empty, and we can't bear it for the time being."

After discovering these situations, the Wendeng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party invited the responsible persons of some agricultural production cooperatives and relevant departments to hold a forum in early March. At the meeting, some of the responsible persons of the agricultural production cooperatives criticized these practices, and the relevant departments also conducted inspections, and initially determined that 30 junior primary schools out of the county's 585 primary schools would be transferred to be run by the cooperatives this year, and another 100 primary schools would be transferred to be jointly run by the cooperatives and the government, with the cooperatives bearing 30% to 50% of the expenses according to their actual capabilities, and the rest would be transferred to be run by the cooperatives in batches in the next few years according to the development of the cooperatives. In terms of health undertakings, each production team of large agricultural production cooperatives is required to set up a health care kit, and each smaller cooperative is required to set up one kit, and purchase medicines in stages according to actual needs. Other departments are also revising their plans according to the actual needs and affordability of the agricultural production cooperatives, in order to minimize the non-productive expenditures of the agricultural production cooperatives.

### 山东文登县的文教、卫生等部门修订计划  尽量减少农业合作社非生产性开支

    山东文登县的文教、卫生等部门修订计划
    尽量减少农业合作社非生产性开支
    新华社济南24日电　山东省文登县的文教、卫生、邮电等部门最近纠正了过多过高地要求农业生产合作社举办文化福利事业，以致增加非生产性开支的现象。
    这几个部门在工作中曾经不顾目前农业生产合作社的实际能力，提出许多过高的要求。例如，县文教科要求在今年上半年就把一百五十所小学转为由农业生产合作社办；新华书店在向合作社推销书刊时，要求买得越多越好；卫生部门要求每个生产队在今年春季买一个保健箱，每个箱一次配备价值十六元多的药品；邮电局计划到四月底就在每个乡设邮递员，工资由农业生产合作社负担，还要每个合作社预支十元购买邮票。
    由于这样就使农业生产合作社增加了许多非生产性的开支。灯塔农业生产合作社今年计划用在文化和卫生等福利事业上的开支达一万一千六百多元。勤俭农业生产合作社一次就购买了一百一十多元书籍。有些合作社的社员说：“这些事都是好事，就是社初办，底子空，暂时受不了。”
    中共文登县委员会发现这些情况以后，曾在三月上旬邀请一些农业生产合作社和有关部门的负责人举行座谈会。会上，有些农业生产合作社的负责人对这些做法提出了批评，有关部门也都进行了检查，并且初步确定：全县585所小学中今年有三十所初级小学转为社办，另外有一百所小学转为社办公助，根据社的实际能力分别由社负担30％到50％的费用，其余根据社的发展情况在今后几年中再分批转为社办。在卫生事业方面，要求大的农业生产合作社的每个生产队设一个保健箱，较小的社每社设一个箱，按照实际需要分期购买药品。其他各部门，也都正在根据农业生产合作社的实际需要和负担能力修订计划，以尽量减少农业生产合作社的非生产性开支。
