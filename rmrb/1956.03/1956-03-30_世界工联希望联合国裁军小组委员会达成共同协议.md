    Xinhua News Agency, London, March 28th, via TASS: The World Federation of Trade Unions has written a letter to the Soviet representative of the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee, Gromyko, expressing hope that the work of the Disarmament Subcommittee will soon lead to a common agreement on gradual and supervised disarmament.
    The letter states: Disarmament is a necessary condition for further improving international relations and peaceful cooperation between countries. Disarmament can save a large amount of money, which can be used to improve people's living standards and advance economic and social progress. Therefore, more and more trade union organizations with various tendencies and political beliefs now advocate disarmament.
    The letter further states: The progress already made in disarmament negotiations and the various proposals submitted to the Subcommittee mean that it is now possible and realistic to reach an agreement on universal, gradual, and supervised disarmament, reducing the number of armed forces, and banning nuclear weapons, which is in the interests of the majority of working men and women.
    The letter was signed by Louis Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

    世界工联希望联合国裁军小组委员会达成共同协议
    新华社29日讯　据塔斯社伦敦二十八日讯：世界工会联合会给联合国裁军委员会小组委员会苏联代表葛罗米柯写了一封信，希望裁军小组委员会的工作将能很快达成逐步的和有监督的裁军的共同协议。
    信里说：裁军是进一步改进国际关系和各国和平合作的必要条件。裁军可以把大量款项节省下来，用来提高人民的生活水平，向经济和社会进步迈进。因此，越来越多的各种倾向和政治信仰的工会组织现在主张裁军。
    这封信又说：在裁军问题谈判中所已经取得的进展以及向小组委员会提出的各种建议，意味着现在就普遍逐步有监督的裁军、缩减武装部队数量和禁止核子武器达成协议是可能的、现实的，这符合大多数男女劳动人民的利益。
    这封信是由世界工联总书记路易·赛扬签署的。
