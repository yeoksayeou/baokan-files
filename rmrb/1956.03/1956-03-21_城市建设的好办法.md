    The Lüda City Urban Construction Bureau, learning from Soviet experience, has implemented unified management of civil buildings throughout the city: After the plans of various construction units are approved by the Municipal People's Committee, the Urban Construction Bureau is responsible for unified planning, investment, design, and construction; after the houses are built, they are handed over to the Real Estate Management Bureau for unified management and distribution.

    This approach has many benefits: First, it facilitates unified urban planning. Second, the contracting units can comprehensively consider construction costs, material usage, and manpower allocation, maximizing the effectiveness of investment. In terms of housing management, it is also easier to make unified adjustments, making the allocation and use of housing more reasonable. Third, construction units no longer need to set up dedicated personnel and specialized institutions to carry out this work, which saves both manpower and materials, and simplifies procedures, shortening the construction preparation period. Fourth, construction and design units can design and prepare for construction earlier; it also facilitates the promotion of standard designs, the use of prefabricated components, and the organization of year-round production.

    All construction units in the country engaged in civil building construction should actively support this advanced measure and assist the urban construction departments in quickly promoting this advanced management system in various cities.

    城市建设的好办法
    旅大市城市建设局学习苏联经验，对全市的民用建筑实行统一管理：各个建设单位的计划经市人民委员会批准后，由城市建设局负责统一规划、投资、设计、施工；房屋建成后，交由房地产管理局统一管理、分配。
    这样做，好处很多：第一、便利统一进行城市规划。第二、承建单位能统盘考虑建筑造价、材料使用和力量的配备等，可以充分发挥投资效果。在房屋管理方面也便于统一调整，使房屋的分配和使用更加合理。第三、建设单位不需再设专人和专门机构进行这一工作，既节省人力和物力；又能简化手续，缩短施工准备日期。第四、建筑和设计单位可以及早设计和准备施工；又便于推行标准设计，采用预制构件，组织常年生产。
    全国所有进行民用建筑的建设单位，应该积极地支持这个先进的措施，协助城市建设部门迅速地把这个先进的管理制度，在各城市中推行开来。
