    Request for Increased Supply of Tractor Parts
    To the Editor:
    We, the staff of the Beijing Municipal Agricultural Machine and Tractor Station, urgently request a solution to the insufficient supply of tractor parts and agricultural machinery accessories.
    Our station has a very heavy cultivation task. In order to rush-plow the land for farmers and ensure increased agricultural production, we feel extremely happy and excited despite our very tense work. However, during last year's autumn and winter plowing, it often happened that tractors had to be stopped because parts or accessories were damaged and could not be replaced. This seriously affected our work and made our farmer brothers very unhappy. In addition, many tractor parts that should have been replaced could not be, and plowshares, plow bottoms, and moldboards were worn out beyond recognition but were still being used makeshift.
    During last year's winter repairs, this problem remained unresolved. Now that spring plowing is about to begin, the farmers are in high spirits and are enthusiastically requesting the agricultural machine and tractor station to cultivate more land for them. However, the staff of our station frequently goes to the Supply Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Shuangqiao Materials Supply Station to appeal for a solution to the problem of tractor parts and accessories, but still cannot obtain the parts and accessories that we should have.
    Of course, the new-style agricultural implements such as double-wheeled double-furrow plows should be vigorously promoted to farmers at present, and tractors cannot yet be universally used in agricultural production. However, effectively leveraging the role of existing tractors can not only allow farmers to see the prospects of agricultural mechanization but also prepare conditions for the large-scale use of tractors in the future. Allowing currently used tractors to be idle for a long time or not being fully utilized due to a shortage of one or two parts is not only a waste but will also create a bad political influence among the masses of farmers. In fact, accessories and certain parts for tractors such as plows and seeders can be produced domestically. The relevant departments of the Ministry of Agriculture should contact the industrial leading departments to solve this problem. As for those that still need to be ordered from abroad, plans should be put forward as soon as possible to avoid the occurrence of insufficient supply.

### 要求多多供应拖拉机的零件

    要求多多供应拖拉机的零件编辑同志：
    我们北京市农业机器拖拉机站的工作人员，迫切要求解决拖拉机零件和农业机械配件供应不足的问题。
    我们站的耕种任务很重。为了替农民抢耕土地，保证农业增产，我们虽然工作十分紧张，却感到无比的愉快和兴奋。但是，在去年秋耕和冬耕的时候，经常发生零件或配件损坏后无法换配而使拖拉机不得不停车的事情。这就严重影响了我们的工作，并且使农民弟兄很有意见。此外，有很多拖拉机零件该换了也不能换、犁尖、犁床、翻土板都磨损得不成样子，仍然在凑合着使用。
    到去年冬修期间，这个问题仍然得不到解决。现在春耕即将开始了，农民们生产情绪很高，他们热烈地要求农业机器拖拉机站为他们耕种更多的土地。但是，我们站的工作人员，为了解决拖拉机零件和配件的问题，经常到农业部供应局和双桥物资供应站去奔走呼吁，却仍然不能得到应有的零件和配件。
    当然，目前向农民大量推广的应该是双轮双铧犁等新式农具，拖拉机在农业生产中还不可能普遍使用。但是，有效地发挥现有拖拉机的作用，不但可以使农民看到农业机械化的远景，而且也是为将来大量使用拖拉机准备条件。让现用的拖拉机因为短少一两个零件就长期闲置或不能充分利用，不但是一种浪费，而且也会在农民群众中造成不好的政治影响。实际上，像拖拉机使用的犁、播种机等配件和某些零件在国内是有条件生产的，农业部有关部门应该同工业领导部门联系解决这个问题。至于目前还需要向国外订货的，也应该及早提出计划，以避免发生供应不上的情况。
