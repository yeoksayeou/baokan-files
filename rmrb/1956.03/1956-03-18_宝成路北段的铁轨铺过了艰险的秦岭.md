Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 17th - The rail-laying project on the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway passed through the last major tunnel in the Qinling Mountains area – the Qinling Tunnel – this afternoon. Only over 100 kilometers of track laying remains for the entire line.

The terrain and geological conditions in the Qinling area are extremely complex, with natural slopes reaching over 40 per thousand. After crossing the Wei River, the line heads south along the Qingjiang River, winding around the waist and peaks of the Qinling Mountains at an elevation of over 1,000 meters, passing through dozens of tunnels and many large and medium-sized bridges, and finally crossing the treacherous Qinling Mountains through the Qinling Grand Tunnel. The line has steep gradients, many curves, and densely packed construction sites, which interfere with each other, and the line interferes with roads and rivers. The arduousness and complexity of the project are rare in the history of world railway construction. However, the workers overcame these arduous difficulties one by one with courageous labor and creativity. They once created a simple rail-laying machine using a tractor to tow a rail-lifting frame according to the characteristics of the site, overcoming the difficulties of using locomotives and manual rail-laying due to the dense tunnels and steep slopes, accelerating the progress of the project and ensuring the quality of the project.

    宝成路北段的铁轨铺过了艰险的秦岭
    据新华社西安17日电　宝成铁路北段铺轨工程已经在今天下午穿过秦岭地带的最后一座大隧道——秦岭隧道。全线铺轨工程只剩下100多公里。
    秦岭一带的地形和地质情况，极为复杂，自然坡度达千分之四十以上。线路跨过渭河以后，沿清江河南下，迂回在拔海1，000多公尺的秦岭山腰和山峰之间，通过几十座隧道和许多座大中桥梁，最后以秦岭大隧道穿过艰险的秦岭。线路上坡道陡、曲线多、工点密集，工点和工点相干扰，线路和公路、河流相干扰，工程的艰巨性和复杂性是世界筑路史上所少见的。但是职工们用勇敢的劳动和创造性，把这些艰巨的困难一个一个地克服了。他们曾经根据现场的特点，创造了利用拖拉机牵引吊轨架的简易铺轨机械，克服了因为隧道密、坡度陡而难于使用机车铺轨和人工铺轨的困难，加快了工程进度，同时也保证了工程的质量。
