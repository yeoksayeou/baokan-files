Strive for the Prosperity of Literary Creation
——Report at the Second (Enlarged) Meeting of the Council of the Chinese Writers Association (Abstract)——
Liu Baiyu
The main responsibility or key to the prosperity of literary creation lies in the leadership of the Writers Association. The Writers Association has done a lot of positive and beneficial work since the Second Congress of Literary and Art Workers, which has enabled the literary cause to make progress. From 1954 to 1955, under the leadership of the Party, we launched a series of struggles on the literary front, namely: the struggle to criticize Yu Pingbo's bourgeois idealist thought in the study of "Dream of the Red Chamber"; the criticism of Hu Feng's bourgeois reactionary literary thought, and the transition to the movement to eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and other hidden counter-revolutionaries; and the prevention of the activities of individualist sectarian groups in the literary and art ranks. At the same time, in 1955, a struggle against moral degradation among writers was carried out, starting with the exposure of Kong Jue's corrupt moral behavior.

As a result of these struggles, especially the opposition to conservatism in which leadership lagged behind reality and lagged behind the masses, the Writers Association had a new and realistic understanding of the creative forces, that is, the literary creative forces are growing rapidly, and the question is whether our leadership is truly a leadership that promotes the advancement of creative forces.

In order to prosper creation, the Writers Association should:

(1) Organize writers to go deep into life, and help writers improve their ideological level and artistic skills. When it comes to the prosperity of creation, people naturally place their primary hope on those skilled writers with rich life experience and creative experience. They have made various contributions to China's literary cause. If, in the great twelve years to come, we are marching towards the peak of advanced world literature, then they should be the backbone force driving us forward. However, among these comrades, going deep into life and improving ideological level and artistic skills is still a problem that needs to be seriously solved. At present, the lack of deep understanding of the life of the working people is still the most important obstacle to improving the level of creation. Many comrades used to be familiar with the past struggle life, but they are not familiar with today's construction life. There are still a considerable number of writers who are floating on the surface of life, and a more serious phenomenon is that some have reduced or even lost their enthusiasm for life, and have begun to feel that going to life is a difficult thing. Now that social life is developing by leaps and bounds, and new things and new people are being born and growing every day, writers will only fall far behind life if they do not thoroughly solve the problem of going deep into life. Therefore, the Writers Association should use all its strength to help writers go deep into life, determine and establish their own life base, and establish a regular and close connection with social life.

Now our writers, along with all state cadres, will systematically and organizedly study Marxist-Leninist theory. For our literary workers, we should also pay special attention to studying Marxist-Leninist literary theory and improve our aesthetic cultivation.

(2) Mobilize creative forces on a broader scale. The creative potential in the posts of national construction work is quite strong. The vast majority of them have rich experience in struggle, and have closer contact with the current construction life, and their creative enthusiasm is also very high. One of the major tasks of the Writers Association is to discover geniuses among the people. For comrades in the posts of national construction work who are confident of carrying out creation, we hope to solve their writing problems by means of creative vacations. If we discover truly talented writers, we should also give them greater help, training, and creative conditions, so that their talents can be fully utilized. For the creative problems of writers in literary organization and editorial work posts, we hope to establish such a system to solve them. By means of rotation, ensure that a writer participating in the work has an average of 2 to 3 months a year to go to the working people to contact life. At the same time, under the premise of completing his business work that he should bear, he can have two fixed creation days every week. For writers and literary workers, no matter in any situation, they should be encouraged and promoted by various methods to contact life, and the method of rotation should be used so that most working comrades can go to our factories and rural areas to see the boiling socialist upsurge.

(3) Actively cultivate young writers. The most important and most effective work in cultivating young writers is, in any case, to be done by old writers. The traditions of Gorky and Lu Xun show how a truly great writer helps young people. Their work not only affects that generation, but also affects the literary prosperity of the next generation. However, here, a complaining voice, a voice that dislikes trouble, has been issued from the mouths of some writers. Let this voice completely disappear from our ranks!

The editorial departments of literary newspapers and periodicals have a special responsibility in cultivating young literary talents. In this regard, the Writers Association should take specific measures. This year, a national conference of editors of literary publications is planned to be held, which will clearly stipulate the specific tasks of literary publications in cultivating young people. We are very much in need of, and will give the greatest respect to, those editors who are willing to cultivate young people with lofty and selfless enthusiasm.

(4) Expand the themes and styles of writing. This time, when formulating the work plan for 1956-1967, the sub-associations have paid attention to the issue of enriching creative themes. Just look, how many inexhaustible themes have the Chinese people's heroic struggle and diligent construction created for us to write about! This is simply an undeveloped and infinite treasure mountain. We have historical themes that we have not yet or rarely touched upon, such as the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom peasant uprising, the Sanyuanli peasant resistance against the British movement, the February 7th Great Strike, the Hunan peasant movement in the Great Revolution era, the Hailufeng peasant movement, the Jinggangshan base area, the Party's underground struggle life, and the heroic and unparalleled 25,000-li Long March; we have modern themes that have not yet been well expressed, such as Anshan Iron and Steel, the Yangtze River Bridge, the Sanmenxia Hydropower Station on the Yellow River, automobile factories, tractor factories, railways, exploration, forests, minority ethnic group life, fishermen's life, young student life, shop assistant life, and the struggle of coastal defense and border defense. What I am talking about here are all listed in the sub-association's long-term plan. When we organize creation according to such a plan, will anyone think that this is again giving topics for writing articles? No, it is entirely voluntary for writers to choose what themes, but raising this issue here reflects the demands and wishes of the people, and sincere writers have always valued the demands and wishes of the people.

If the styles and genres of literature can be compared to various weapons in struggle, then the weapons we have in our hands are also very scarce, which makes literature unable to adapt to the needs of life and struggle, and makes the content of our literary publications monotonous and lacking in diversity. I would especially like to talk about short stories and feature articles here. Strictly speaking, our entire literary team has not yet mastered, or even valued, the fighting literary genre of feature articles. Newspapers have left us a broad area where we can gallop, where writers can talk to hundreds of thousands or millions of people most quickly; where writers can influence and promote the socialist construction life with enthusiastic praise and severe criticism. However, in this regard, we are particularly unlikely to see the names of our many famous writers. We have every reason to hope that our writers will write truly good feature articles, not just descriptions, but feature articles that are both combative and artistic.

(5) Carry out creation competitions, free discussions, and enliven the activities of creation groups. The content and form of the creation group should be rich and lively, and should not make participants feel burdened or stereotyped. Of course, we do not need non-comradely, unhelpful polite compliments or cold silence.

Finally, we must pay attention to running the publications well, because literary publications are not only literary positions at any time, but also organizers. Publications have a major impact on literary creation. Now that we are talking about developing creation and prospering creation, literary publications have special tasks. To do a good job in editing, we must first love our work, respect our work, and be like Lu Xun, who supported countless progressive literary publications throughout his life, making those publications a garden for literary prosperity.

We should use our greatest love to do a good job in all aspects of our literary work to promote the real development and prosperity of literature.

    为繁荣文学创作而奋斗
    ——在中国作家协会第二次理事会会议（扩大）上的报告（摘要）——
    刘白羽
    繁荣文学创作的主要责任或关键，是在于作家协会的领导。作家协会在第二次文代会到现在这一段时间内，作了许多积极有益的工作，使文学事业得到了进展。1954年到1955年，在党的领导下，我们在文学战线上展开了一系列的斗争，这就是：批判俞平伯在“红楼梦”研究中的资产阶级唯心主义思想的斗争；批判了胡风的资产阶级反动文艺思想，并转入肃清胡风反革命集团及其他暗藏的反革命分子的运动；制止了文艺队伍中的个人主义宗派集团的活动。同时，在1955年内，还曾经从揭露孔厥的败坏道德的行为开始，进行了反对作家中道德堕落现象的斗争。
    由于经过了这些斗争，特别是由于反对了领导落后于实际、落后于群众的保守主义，作家协会对于创作力量的估计有了新的合乎实际的认识，那就是文学创作力量正在迅速地成长，问题在于我们的领导是不是真正促进创作力量前进的领导。
    为了繁荣创作，作家协会应当：
    （一）组织作家深入生活，帮助作家提高思想水平和艺术技巧。谈到繁荣创作，人们自然把首要的希望，寄托在我们那些熟练的、有着丰富的生活经验与创作经验的作家身上。他们曾经给中国的文学事业作出过各种贡献。如果说，在今后伟大的十二年间，我们是在向世界先进文学的高峰进军，那末，他们应当是带动我们前进的骨干力量。可是就在这些同志中间，深入生活与提高思想水平和艺术技巧也还是一个需要认真解决的问题。目前，对于劳动人民生活认识、理解的不够深刻，还是提高创作水平最主要的障碍。不少同志曾经熟悉过过去的斗争生活，但是不熟悉今天的建设生活了。还有相当一部分作家，现在还是飘浮在生活的表面，更严重的现象是，有的已经减少了、甚至消失了对生活的热情，而开始感到到生活中去是困苦的事了。现在社会生活飞跃地发展着，新的事、新的人每天在诞生、成长，作家如果不彻底地解决深入生活问题，就只有远远地落在生活的后面。因此作家协会应当用一切力量帮助作家深入到生活中去，确定和建立自己的生活根据地，与社会生活取得经常的、密切的联系。
    现在我们的作家和所有国家干部一起，都将有计划、有组织地进行马克思列宁主义理论学习。对于我们文学工作者，还应当特别地注意学习马克思列宁主义文艺理论，提高我们的美学修养。
    （二）在更广阔的范围内发动创作力量。在国家建设工作岗位上的创作潜力是相当强大的，他们绝大多数有着丰富的斗争经验，而且与当前建设生活有较密切的联系，创作积极性也是很高的。作家协会的重大任务之一，就是在人民中发现天才，对于在国家建设工作岗位上的，已经有把握进行创作的同志，希望能用创作假期的办法解决他们的写作问题。如果发现了真正有天才的作家，我们还应当给以更大的帮助、培养、创作的条件，使他的才能得到充分的发挥。对于在文学组织工作编辑工作岗位上的作家的创作问题，我们希望建立这样一种制度来解决，用轮流的办法，保证一个参加工作的作家每年平均有2至3个月的时间到劳动人民中间去接触生活，同时，在完成他应该担负的业务工作的情况下，每周可以有两个固定的创作日。对于作家、文学工作者，不论在任何情况下，应该用各种方法鼓励他们、推动他们去接触生活，应当用轮流的办法，使得大多数工作同志，都能到我们的工厂、农村中去看看正在沸腾着的社会主义高潮。
    （三）积极地培养青年作家。培养青年作家最主要的、最有成效的工作，无论如何是要老作家来作的。高尔基和鲁迅的传统说明，一个真正伟大的作家，是如何帮助青年的，他们的工作不仅仅影响那一代，而且影响着下一代的文学繁荣。可是，在我们这里，却从某些作家口中发出了一种抱怨的声音，嫌麻烦的声音，让这种声音从我们队伍中完全消失吧！
    文学报纸、刊物的编辑部，在培养文学青年的工作上，有着特殊的责任。在这方面，作家协会应当采取具体措施。今年准备召开全国文学刊物编辑会议，就要明确规定文学刊物培养青年的具体任务。我们非常需要，也将以最大的尊重给予那种肯以崇高、忘我的热情，作培养青年工作的编辑人员。
    （四）扩大写作的题材和体裁。这一次制定1956—1967年的工作规划时，各分会已经注意到丰富创作题材这个问题了。请看一看，中国人民的英勇斗争和勤劳建设，给我们创造了多少可以写之不尽的题材吧！这简直是未开发的无穷的宝山，我们有太平天国农民起义、三元里农民抗英运动、二七大罢工、大革命时代的湖南农民运动、海陆丰农民运动、井岗山根据地、党的地下斗争生活、英勇绝伦的二万五千里长征种种到今天我们还没有或很少接触过的历史题材；我们有鞍钢、长江大桥、黄河三门峡发电站、汽车厂、拖拉机厂、铁路、勘探、森林、少数民族生活、渔民生活、青年学生生活、店员生活及海防与边防的斗争种种到现在还没很好表现的现代题材。我在这儿谈的都是分会远景规划上所列举的。当我们根据这样的规划去组织创作时，会不会有人认为这又是出题目作文章了呢？不，作家选择什么题材，这是完全自愿的事情，但是，在这里提出这问题，是反映了人民的要求和愿望，真诚的作家从来是重视人民的要求和愿望的。
    如果把文学的样式和体裁可以譬喻作斗争中的各种武器的话，我们现在手里掌握的武器也是十分贫乏的，这就使文学不能适应生活、斗争的需要，就使我们的文学刊物的内容枯燥而缺乏多样性。我在这儿特别想谈谈短篇小说和特写。严格地说，我们整个文学队伍到现在还没有掌握、甚至还没有重视特写这种战斗的文学体裁。报纸给我们留下广阔的可以驰骋的地盘，在那儿，作家可以最迅速地和几十万、几百万人谈话；在那儿作家可以用热情的歌颂与严峻的批判来影响、推动社会主义建设生活。可是，在这一方面，我们特别不容易看到我们许多有名的作家的名字。我们完全有理由希望我们的作家写出真正好的特写，不是仅仅地描摹一下，而是有战斗性又有艺术性的特写。
    （五）开展创作竞赛，自由讨论，活跃创作组的活动。创作组的内容、方式应该丰富、活泼，而不要使参加的人只感到负担，刻板化。当然，我们也不需要非同志式的、毫无帮助的客气恭维或冷淡的沉默。
    最后，我们必须注意到的是把刊物办好，因为文学刊物在任何时候，它不仅仅是文学阵地，同时也是组织者，刊物对于文学的创作是起着重大的影响的。我们现在讲发展创作、繁荣创作，文学刊物就有着特殊的任务，作好编辑工作，首先必须要热爱自己的工作，尊重自己的工作，要像鲁迅那样，他一生支持过无数进步的文学刊物，使那些刊物成为繁荣文学的园地。
    我们应当用我们最大的热爱，作好我们一切方面的文学工作，来推动文学真正的发展与繁荣。
