    Since the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau issued the call to complete the bridge ahead of schedule in November of last year, the number of rationalization proposals from employees has increased month by month: 34 in October last year, 76 in November, 79 in December, and 107 in January of this year. Among them, the suggestions made by worker Wu Faxing and technician Su Wenpu respectively regarding the merging of cables saved more than 40,000 yuan. However, how did the leadership treat the enthusiasm of the masses? The Second Bridge Team had 22 rationalization proposals in December of last year, but only one was adopted, and even that one was not implemented. The Engineering Bureau once helped various units implement the rationalization proposal topic method, which achieved good results, but this method was not consistently implemented in various units. The Second Bridge Team and the Economic Rental Station have not proposed any topics recently.
    For a long time, the various units of the Bridge Engineering Bureau have not attached importance to the rationalization proposals of the employees and masses, and have not attached importance to the promotion of advanced experience. Workers of the Second Bridge Team created the whole concrete model form installation method at the Jianghan Bridge. This method moves the assembly work of the model form from high altitude to the ground, which can ensure personal safety, improve the quality of the model form assembly, and can perform parallel operations with pouring concrete, shortening the construction period. However, when this method was first proposed, it was suppressed by some leaders. Later, with the support of Soviet experts, it was successfully tested. Each pier of the Yangtze River Bridge requires the assembly of about 10 sections of model form, and the workload is very large. If the whole model form installation method is used, its benefits are very obvious. However, after this advanced working method was used on the Jianghan Bridge, it was shelved and not used on the Yangtze River Bridge. Recently, Soviet experts made suggestions on this issue, and the Engineering Bureau included the implementation of this advanced method on the bridge in this year's technical organization measures plan. Worker Guan Yeliang of the First Bridge Team implemented the double welding rod method from March of last year, shortening the time to weld one section of pipe column from the initial 14 hours to 3 hours, overcoming the weak link in the manufacturing of pipe columns. This working method was also suppressed during its implementation and caused trouble for several months; Soviet experts supported this working method, saying "not only can two welding rods be used, but six can also be used," before it was officially approved for use on September 15th of last year. However, from the time of approval until late February of this year, the Engineering Bureau did not systematically promote it among the welding workers of its three main units, especially not in the welding workshop of the Economic Rental Station—the key unit for bridge welding work. Engineer Gong Shishen of the Technical Inspection Office of the Economic Rental Station and welder Jiang Jikang were inspired by Guan Yeliang and conducted multi-welding rod working method experiments at the end of February, but they did not receive the support of the station director of the Economic Rental Station.
    Since the Bridge Engineering Bureau began criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking and proposing the goal of completing the bridge ahead of schedule in November of last year, it has held many meetings and arranged this year's work, but it has not comprehensively planned which advanced experiences should be promoted this year around the central task of implementing the "pipe column drilling method" proposed by the Soviet expert team.
    Does the existence of the "pipe column drilling method" mean that there is no need to develop the wisdom of the masses and no need to promote advanced experience? No. The new "pipe column drilling method" is of great significance for accelerating the construction of the Yangtze River Bridge; however, its successful trial and smooth application to construction are inseparable from the creative labor of the employees and masses. The more than 300 advanced producers and more than 30 advanced units of the Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau have made their own contributions in different positions around the central task of implementing the "pipe column drilling method." Recently, Sirin, the leader of the Soviet expert team, pointed out some specific problems in the construction, such as the rock drilling speed and the problem of preventing quicksand when pouring concrete inside the pipe, which need to be further solved by everyone. This shows how much the Soviet experts hope that the employees and masses will carry out creative labor to enrich and develop this new technology and to complete the Yangtze River Bridge ahead of schedule. Moreover, there are various types of work in the Yangtze River Bridge project, and these works also need to be improved and upgraded.
    Some leaders of the Bridge Engineering Bureau often only emphasize grasping the key points and measures from top to bottom (which is correct); however, they do not have a fundamental understanding of the importance of developing the wisdom of the masses from bottom to top as a way to enrich leadership experience and improve work. Therefore, they stop this aspect of work at general calls and lack planned, specific, and effective ideological and organizational work. This leaves room for various forms of conservative thinking, such as emphasizing the shortcomings of mass suggestions without providing technical assistance, emphasizing the busyness of production without providing the necessary improved production tools, and emphasizing the uniqueness of one's own situation without learning from advanced experience.
    Rewarding and commending advanced producers is not only to encourage them, but also to promote their advanced experience and help everyone reach an advanced level. At the Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau, there are rationalization proposal awards for proposing rationalization proposals; there are new record awards for creating new production records; and there are "victory" awards for winning red flags in labor competitions. However, there are no rewards for the masses' efforts to learn from and catch up with the advanced, or for advanced producers to help everyone improve together. This incomplete reward system actually encourages those who only want to be "winners" and cannot work well together, who only want to bury themselves in "creation" and are unwilling to learn from other people's advanced experience, and who are unwilling to take the initiative to introduce their own advanced experience to others. Only a few advanced producers with a high degree of socialist consciousness, like the Shi Xiaobao work team, are not affected by these systems and actively helped other teams create new records for sinking pipe columns.
    The lack of a hard-working style is also a reason. In October of last year, the staff of the Bridge Trade Union and the engineer in charge of rationalization proposals discovered that in the work of manufacturing screws, a blacksmith in the First Bridge Team improved the tools and increased the production of rough forgings from 150 per shift to more than 600, but the lathe operators could not keep up, and the screw production could not be increased; a lathe operator in the Second Bridge Team improved the tools and increased the work of threading screws from more than 100 per shift to more than 700, but the blacksmiths could not keep up, and the screw production could not be increased. If the advanced experiences of these two units were combined, the screw production could be significantly increased. They urged many times before they were able to organize the relevant blacksmiths and lathe operators from these two units to visit and exchange experiences with each other. However, after the visit, everyone thought that it had been "promoted" and no one cared about it anymore. As a result, the lathe operators in the First Bridge Team believed that their lathe structure was not exactly the same and that it was difficult to improve, so they did not move, and their production has remained at about the same level as before.
    In short, all of these illustrate one problem: In the face of the unprecedentedly high enthusiasm of the employees and masses for construction, the leaders of enterprises must thoroughly correct right-leaning conservative thinking, improve management work in all aspects, improve work style, and create conditions for advanced producers and the promotion of advanced experience. Only in this way can the role of advanced producers and advanced experience be fully brought into play, and can the effect of completing the national plan ahead of schedule be truly achieved.

### 为推广先进经验创造条件

    为推广先进经验创造条件
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    武汉长江大桥工程局自从去年11月提出提前建成大桥的号召以来，职工的合理化建议逐月增加：去年10月34件，11月76件，12月79件，今年1月107件。其中由工人武发兴和技术员苏文溥分别提出的关于合并电缆的建议，就节约4万多元。但是，领导上是怎样对待群众热情的呢？二桥队去年12月有22件合理化建议，只采纳了一件，而且就连这一件也没有实现。工程局曾经帮助各单位实行合理化建议课题的办法，获得了较好的效果，但是这个办法并没有在各单位坚持执行，二桥队和经租站最近就没有提出课题来。
    大桥工程局各单位长期就不重视职工群众的合理化建议，不重视推广先进经验。二桥队的工人，在江汉桥创造了混凝土模型板整体安装法。这个方法把模型板的拼装工作从高空移到平地上来作，能保障人身安全，提高模型板拼装的质量，并且可以和浇灌混凝土平行作业，缩短工期。但是当这个方法刚被提出来的时候，就受到某些领导人员的压制，后来由于苏联专家的支持，才得以试验成功。长江大桥每个桥墩都要拼装10节左右的模型板，工作量很大，如果使用模型板整体安装法，它的好处是十分显明的。但是，这个先进工作法在江汉桥运用以后，就被搁置起来了，没有在长江大桥上运用。最近，苏联专家对这个问题提出了意见，工程局才把在大桥实行这个先进方法列入了今年的技术组织措施计划。一桥队的工人管业良，从去年3月起实行双焊条工作法，把最初14小时焊一节管柱缩短到3小时焊一节，克服了制造管柱的薄弱环节。这个工作法在实行中也受到压制，一直闹了几个月；苏联专家支持这个工作法，专家说“不仅能用两根焊条，就是六根也行”，才在去年9月15日被正式批准使用。但是在批准使用以来到今年2月下旬，工程局并没有有计划地在所属三个主要单位的电焊工人中推广，特别是没有在经租站的电焊车间——大桥电焊工作的重点单位推广。经租站技术检查室的工程师龚世身和电焊工江济康受到管业良的启发，在2月底进行多焊条工作法试验，也没得到经租站站长的支持。
    大桥工程局从去年11月开始批判右倾保守思想和提出提前建成大桥的目标以来，已经开了许多会议，布置了今年工作，但是他们并没有围绕贯彻执行苏联专家工作组创议的“管柱钻孔法”这一中心，全面规划出今年要推广哪些先进经验。
    是不是有了“管柱钻孔法”，就不需要发挥群众的智慧，不需要推广先进经验呢？不。“管柱钻孔法”这个新技术对加速建设长江大桥有重大意义；但是，它所以试验成功并且顺利用于施工，是同职工群众进行创造性的劳动分不开的。长江大桥工程局的300多个先进生产者和30多个先进单位，都围绕贯彻执行“管柱钻孔法”这一中心，在不同岗位上作出了自己的贡献。最近，苏联专家组长西林指出了施工中的一些具体问题，如钻岩速度问题和打管内混凝土防止流砂问题等，都需要大家进一步加以解决。这说明苏联专家是多么希望职工群众为丰富和发展这个新的技术，为提前建成长江大桥而进行创造性的劳动。何况长江大桥的工程中还有各种各样的工作，这些工作也需要改进和提高。
    大桥工程局有的领导人员往往只强调从上而下抓关键，抓措施（这是正确的）；而对自下而上地发挥群众智慧是丰富领导经验和改善工作的根本认识不够，因此把这方面的工作停止在一般的号召上，缺乏有计划地进行具体的有效的思想工作和组织工作。这就给形形色色的保守思想，例如强调群众建议有缺点而又不在技术上加以帮助，强调生产忙而不给制造必要改进的生产工具，强调自己情况特殊而不学习先进经验等等，留下了活动余地。
    奖励和表扬先进生产者，绝不仅是为了鼓励他们，而是要把他们的先进经验加以推广，帮助大家达到先进的水平。在长江大桥工程局，提出了合理化建议，有合理化建议奖；创造了生产新纪录，有新纪录奖；在劳动竞赛中获得了红旗，有“优胜”奖。但是，对群众努力学习先进，赶上先进，以及先进生产者帮助大家共同提高，没有奖励。这样不全面的奖励制度实际上就鼓励了只愿当“优胜者”而不能很好团结互助，只愿自己埋头搞“创造”而不愿学习别人的先进经验，自己有了先进经验也不肯主动向别人介绍。只有少数像史小保工班这样具有高度社会主义觉悟的先进生产者，才不受这些制度的影响，主动帮助别班创造了下沉管柱的新纪录。
    缺乏艰苦的工作作风也是一个原因。去年10月，大桥工会组织的工作人员和主管合理化建议的工程师就发现在制造螺丝的工作中，一桥队有个锻工改进了工具，把锻毛胚的工作由每班生产150个提高到600多个，但是车工赶不上，螺丝生产提不高；二桥队有个车工改进了工具，把车螺丝的工作由每班车100多个提高到700多个，而锻工赶不上，螺丝生产也提不高。如果把这两个单位的先进经验加以综合，螺丝生产就可以显著提高了。他们催促了多少次，才使这两个单位把有关的锻工、车工组织起来互相参观和交流经验。但是参观以后，大家就以为“推广”了，都不管这件事了。结果一桥队的车工认为他们的车床结构不完全一样，改进有困难，没有动，他们的生产至今仍然停留在和原来相差不多的水平上。
    总之，这些都说明一个问题：在职工群众的建设热情空前高涨的情况下，企业的领导人员必须彻底纠正右倾保守思想，从各个方面改进管理工作，改进工作作风，为先进生产者和推广先进经验创造条件。只有这样，才能把先进生产者和先进经验的作用充分发挥出来，真正在提前完成国家计划上收到效果。
