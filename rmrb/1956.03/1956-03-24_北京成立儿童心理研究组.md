    The Children's Psychology Research Group, jointly formed by the Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Psychology Teaching and Research Section of Beijing Normal University, has recently begun its research work.
    The task of this research group is to first conduct research on the age characteristics of pre-school children, and then move on to the study of the characteristics of first-grade (seven-year-old) and children of all age groups, so as to provide educators with scientific arguments from a psychological perspective.
    Currently, they are temporarily using the Affiliated Kindergarten of Beijing Normal University as an experimental base to study issues such as sensation and perception, memory, language and thinking, and personality.
    There are many practical problems in children's education, such as how many classes should first-grade students have each day, how many minutes each class should last, and how kindergarten education should be linked with primary school education. These important issues all require psychology as a scientific basis.

    北京成立儿童心理研究组
    由中国科学院心理研究室、北京师范大学心理教研室共同组成的儿童心理研究组最近开始了研究工作。
    这个研究组的任务是先从学龄前的儿童年龄特征进行研究，然后转入小学一年级（七岁）以及各年龄阶段儿童特征的研究，从心理学方面为教育学家提供科学论据。
    现在他们暂以北京师范大学附属幼儿园作为实验基地，研究感觉与知觉，记忆，语言与思维，个性等问题。
    儿童教育上有许多实际问题，例如小学一年级学生每天该上几节课，每节课上几十分钟，幼儿园教育如何与小学教育相衔接等等重要问题，都需要以心理学作为科学根据。
