Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 27th: Liu Jie, the Chinese representative to the international conference on the establishment of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research and Vice Minister of the Ministry of Geology of the People's Republic of China, gave a statement to a TASS reporter regarding the agreement of this international conference.

Liu Jie said that the international conference on the establishment of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research is of historical significance. At this conference, a new type of international cooperation in the field of atomic energy research was established. It must be pointed out that the newly established institute is named the Joint Institute not only because it unites scientists from certain countries; but also other countries, as long as they recognize the agreement adopted by the conference, can also participate in this organization.

Liu Jie continued, the Soviet government's decision a year ago has already played a huge role in establishing scientific experimental bases for developing nuclear physics research in the People's Republic of China and other countries. The establishment of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research is the second major step on this path. This institute will be a tremendous driving force for new achievements in nuclear physics on an international scale, and for using atomic energy to benefit all mankind.

Liu Jie concluded that the Chinese people and Chinese scientists welcome the news of the establishment of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research with great satisfaction. This will help Chinese scientists to rapidly develop research in the field of atomic nuclei.

    刘杰谈成立联合核子研究所的意义
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科二十七日讯：参加关于成立联合核子研究所问题的国际会议的中国代表、中华人民共和国地质部副部长刘杰，就这个国际会议的协定对塔斯社记者发表了谈话。
    刘杰说，关于成立联合核子研究所问题的国际会议有着历史意义。在这个会议上，建立了研究原子能方面的新型国际合作。必须指出，新成立的研究所之所以命名为联合研究所，不仅是因为它团结了某些国家的科学家；而且其他国家，只要承认会议所通过的协定，也可以参加这个组织。
    刘杰接着说，一年前苏联政府的决定，已经在中华人民共和国和其他国家建立发展核子物理研究工作的科学试验基地方面，起了巨大的作用。成立联合核子研究所，就是在这条道路上迈进第二大步。这个研究所对于在国际规模上的核子物理学的新成就、对利用原子能来为全人类谋福利方面，都将是一个十分巨大的动力。
    刘杰最后说，中国人民和中国科学家怀着十分满意的心情欢迎联合核子研究所成立的消息。这将有助于中国科学家迅速发展在原子核方面的研究工作。
