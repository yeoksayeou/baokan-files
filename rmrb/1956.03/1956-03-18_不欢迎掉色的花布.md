    Unwelcome Fading Floral Fabric
    To the Editor:
    I am a young woman working in an office in Nanning City, Guangxi. Recently, the women in our office have taken off their blue uniforms and put on floral dresses. However, one problem is causing us great distress: many floral fabrics currently available, especially floral twill, fade very badly. For example, I made a red-background, black-flower dress, and it changed color after only wearing it for a short time. After washing it once, the red turned pale red; after washing it again, the background color became almost white. As a result, I had to dye the dress black to wear it again. Other comrades who bought floral twill fabric have experienced the same problem. I believe that even if the floral patterns and clothing styles are designed beautifully, if the quality of the floral fabric is poor and it fades after washing, wearing faded clothes is simply not attractive. I suggest that the textile departments pay attention to this problem and improve the dyeing quality of floral fabrics.

### 不欢迎掉色的花布

    不欢迎掉色的花布编辑同志：
    我是一个女青年，现在在广西南宁市某机关工作。我们机关的女同志最近都脱下了蓝制服，换上了花衣裳。但是，有一个问题使我们感到很苦恼：目前有不少花布，特别是花斜纹布，掉色太厉害了。像我做了一件红底黑花的衣服，没有穿多久就变了色；下水一洗红色变成了淡红色；再洗一次，底色几乎变成白的了。这样，我只好把衣服染黑了再穿。其他同志买的花斜纹布也都是这样。我认为，即使花布花样和服装式样设计得很好看，如果花布质量不好，一洗就要掉色，穿上掉色的衣服总是不好看的。建议纺织部门注意这个问题，提高花布的印染质量。　杨代群
