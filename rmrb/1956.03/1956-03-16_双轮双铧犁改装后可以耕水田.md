Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, March 13th: The experiment of modifying the double-wheel two-share plow for paddy field cultivation has been successful. This is the conclusion reached at the National Paddy Field Agricultural Implement Symposium held in Hangzhou.

    During the conference, agricultural machinery experts, professors, engineers, and representatives from the agricultural and industrial departments of various provinces participating in the symposium conducted comparative experiments in paddy fields with different soil textures in Jinhua, Wenzhou, Jiaxing, and Hangxian counties of Zhejiang Province. They compared nine types of double-wheel two-share plows modified by various provinces and more than ten types of improved paddy field plows. After repeated field trials and discussions, the symposium concluded that new-style agricultural implements such as the double-wheel two-share plow can be widely used in paddy fields after reasonable modifications. The main horse-drawn new-style agricultural implements originally suitable for dry land in the North can also be modified into ox-drawn new-style agricultural implements suitable for paddy fields in the South.

    The successful modification of the double-wheel two-share plow for paddy field cultivation is a gratifying event directly related to increased grain production in the southern provinces in the future, and it creates conditions for the transition from the use of new-style animal-powered agricultural implements to the use of tractors in paddy field areas of the South.

    双轮双铧犁改装后可以耕水田
    据新华社杭州13日电　双轮双铧犁经过改装耕水田的试验已经成功。这是在杭州举行的全国水田农具座谈会座谈研究的结果。
    会议期间，出席座谈会的农业机械专家、教授、工程师和各省农业厅、工业厅的代表，先后在浙江省金华、温州、嘉兴、杭县等不同土质的水田中，进行了各省改装的9种双轮双铧犁和十多种改良水田犁耕水田的比较试验。经过反复的实地试验和座谈讨论，座谈会得出结论：双轮双铧犁等新式农具经过合理的改装，能够在水田中普遍使用，原来适合北方旱地使用的主要马拉新式农具也都可以改装成适合南方水田使用的牛拉新式农具。
    双轮双铧犁改装耕水田成功，是南方各省直接关系到今后粮食增产的一件可喜的大事，并为南方水田地区由使用新式畜力农具到使用拖拉机创造了条件。
