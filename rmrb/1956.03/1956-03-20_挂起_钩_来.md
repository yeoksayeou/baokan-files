    Hanging Up the "Hook"
    Chang Yun
    The supply and marketing cooperative in Liling County, Hunan Province, has adopted the method of "linking up" with agricultural production cooperatives and handicraft production cooperatives to conduct supply and marketing business in a planned manner. This method benefits all three types of cooperatives. Not long ago, the supply and marketing cooperatives in various districts of Liling County held joint meetings of supply and marketing cooperatives, handicraft cooperatives, and agricultural cooperatives. At these meetings, the supply and marketing cooperatives signed cooperation contracts with 863 agricultural cooperatives, with a transaction volume of more than 1.94 million yuan. Agricultural cooperatives signed contracts with handicraft cooperatives to purchase small farm tools and repair farm tools. Supply and marketing cooperatives signed processing and ordering contracts with handicraft cooperatives.
    This kind of joint meeting not only promoted the planned production and operation of supply and marketing cooperatives, agricultural cooperatives, and handicraft cooperatives, but also enabled them to understand each other's production and operation status, which helped to overcome their own blindness. For example, the Wangsha First Cooperative in Wangxian District originally planned to buy 14,000 jin of chemical fertilizer. The staff of the supply and marketing cooperative explained the operating conditions of chemical fertilizer at the meeting and agreed to allocate 2,300 jin to them. Seeing that they could not rely solely on commercial fertilizer, the director of Wangsha Cooperative mobilized the members to accumulate a large amount of fertilizer. In just a few days, they collected 70,000 dan of pond mud. With the promotion of the use of double-shared plows, many agricultural cooperatives increased their plans to add new farm tools. The Shiwaxiang Agricultural Production Cooperative originally only planned to buy two, but after the director saw the efficiency of the double-shared plow, they planned to buy sixteen. For example, the production materials section of the Wangxian District Supply and Marketing Cooperative was originally afraid of not being able to sell all the goods if they ordered too much, so they did not dare to ask the higher authorities for more goods. For example, they originally planned to supply only 600 rain capes, which farmers needed very much. At the joint meeting, the agricultural cooperatives in the whole district gathered together the number of rain capes they needed, totaling 1,880, which powerfully broke the conservative thinking of the supply and marketing cooperative cadres.
    In 1955, the Liling County Supply and Marketing Cooperative also signed combination contracts with agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid groups. At that time, there were few cooperatives and many mutual aid groups, and 3,006 units signed contracts, which took two time periods to complete. After the contracts were signed, most of the mutual aid groups could not implement the contracts because the heads of the mutual aid groups could not make decisions for the members. This year, the contracts were signed quickly (more than 800 copies were signed in five days), and many agricultural cooperatives even sent the money to the supply and marketing cooperative in advance to pre-purchase production materials from the supply and marketing cooperative. The current problem is no longer whether the agricultural cooperative can implement the contract, but whether the supply and marketing cooperative can actively organize the supply of goods and strive to meet the needs of the agricultural cooperative.
    The great development of agricultural cooperation has prompted the supply and marketing cooperative to make necessary changes to its operating methods. The method of Liling County Supply and Marketing Cooperative signing combination contracts with agricultural cooperatives on such a large scale should be promoted.

    挂起“钩”来
    长运
    湖南省醴陵县的供销合作社采取同农业生产合作社、手工业生产合作社“挂钩”的方法，有计划地经营供销业务。这种方法，对三种合作社都有好处。不久以前，醴陵县各区供销合作社都召开了供销合作社、手工业合作社、农业合作社的联席会议，在这些会议上，供销合作社和八百六十三个农业合作社签订了结合合同，双方交易额达194万多元；农业合作社和手工业合作社签订了购买小农具和修理农具的合同；供销合作社和手工业合作社签订了加工订货的合同。
    这种联席会议不仅促进了供销合作社、农业合作社、手工业合作社有计划的生产和经营，而且使它们互相了解了对方生产、经营的状况，有助于克服自己的盲目性。例如，王仙区王沙第一合作社原来计划要买一万四千斤化学肥料，供销合作社的工作人员在会上说明化学肥料的经营状况，同时议定分配给他们二千三百斤。王沙社的主任看到不能仅仅指靠商品肥料，就发动社员大量积肥，只有几天的工夫，就挑了七万担塘泥。推广使用双铧犁的技术，许多农业合作社就增加了添置新农具的计划。石湾乡农业生产合作社原来只计划买两部，社主任看到双铧犁的效率后他们就计划购买十六部。又如，王仙区供销合作社生产资料股原来害怕进货多了卖不完，不敢多向上级要货。像农民很需要的蓑衣，原来只计划供应六百件。在联席会上，全区农业合作社把需要数集中起来，共计1，880件，有力地打破供销合作社干部的保守思想。
    醴陵县供销合作社在1955年也同农业合作社、互助组签订过结合合月的同。当时合作社少，互助组多，签订合同的单位有三千零六个，用了两个时间才订完。订了合同以后，多数互助组不能执行合同，原因是互助组长做不了组员的主。今年，合同订的很快（五天订了八百多份），许多农业合作社并且提前把款送到供销合作社，向供销合作社预购生产资料。现在的问题已经不是农业合作社能不能执行合同，而是供销合作社能不能积极组织货源，努力满足农业合作社的需要了。
    农业合作化的大发展，促使供销合作社把经营方式加以必要的改变。醴陵县供销合作社这样大规模和农业合作社签订结合合同的方法，是应该推广的。
