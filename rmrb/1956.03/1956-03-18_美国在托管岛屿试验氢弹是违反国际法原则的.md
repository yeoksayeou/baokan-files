The recent announcement by the U.S. authorities that they will conduct a series of large-scale hydrogen bomb tests in the Pacific Trust Territory – the Marshall Islands – is not only a provocative act that intensifies the "Cold War" and maintains international tension, but also a blatant violation of internationally recognized principles of international law and a serious violation of the United Nations Charter regarding the trust system. The people of the world must stop this illegal crime.

As everyone knows, the principle of freedom of the high seas is a fundamental principle of modern international law. Since the advocacy of the famous international jurist Grotius, this principle has been recognized by various countries by the eighteenth century. This principle was also recognized in the so-called Atlantic Charter announced by the United Kingdom and the United States on August 14, 1941.

According to the principle of freedom of the high seas, the high seas are the "public highway of all nations" and are not allowed to be controlled by any individual country. On the high seas, not only can ships and citizens of all countries navigate freely, but they can also freely fish and engage in other maritime undertakings.

Recently, the U.S. government, in order to test many types of hydrogen bombs and different methods of launching them, declared a dangerous area in the Marshall Islands area of the South Pacific, which is a rectangle with an area of ​​375,000 square nautical miles.

Declaring a vast area of ​​375,000 square nautical miles (approximately 3.5 million square li) of the high seas as a dangerous area, obstructing the navigation, fishing, and other normal activities of ships and citizens of various countries is a blatant violation of the principle of freedom of the high seas.

Some say that in past international practice, there have been precedents of a country exclusively occupying a piece of the high seas for live ammunition target practice. Regardless of the legality of such precedents, they were only limited to a very short period and a very small area, which is different from the U.S.'s setting up dangerous areas in a large area of the high seas and using them for serious and dangerous atomic bomb and hydrogen bomb tests continuously for many years.

Moreover, the so-called setting up of dangerous areas is completely deceptive in hydrogen bomb tests, because it is impossible to predict and limit the direction and range of infection of the radiation particles produced by the hydrogen bomb explosion. The Indian representative to the United Nations said: "India does not believe that any precautions can be taken to prevent radiation." Everyone remembers: In the spring of 1954, the U.S. hydrogen bomb test on Bikini Island caused huge damage to the Japanese people. According to incomplete statistics, the direct property loss caused by the U.S. hydrogen bomb test to the Japanese people was more than 2 billion yen, not to mention the indirect property loss and the loss of mental health and life.

No wonder the Japanese people, who have suffered three times from U.S. atomic bombs, condemn the U.S. for treating them as "guinea pigs" in the laboratory. It is completely understandable that 33 million people have signed the appeal to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs in Japan, and that the Japanese Diet has unanimously passed a resolution requesting a ban on thermonuclear weapons and restricting hydrogen bomb tests, regardless of party affiliation. The author lived in Japan for more than three years after the war, and personally inspected Hiroshima, the first city to be bombed by an atomic bomb, and deeply sympathizes with the Japanese people's desire to avoid atomic disasters.

However, the U.S. government disregards the wishes and demands of the Japanese people, ignores the safety of life of the people in Japan and the Pacific region, and once again declares a vast area of ​​the high seas as a dangerous area for testing large-scale destructive weapons that are cursed by people all over the world - hydrogen bombs. In this way, it not only violates an indisputable principle of international law that has been recognized by countries for 200 years - the principle of freedom of the high seas, but also seriously commits a crime against humanity.

The seriousness of this crime by the U.S. government has another aspect, that is: it thoroughly violates the letter and spirit of the provisions of the United Nations Charter regarding the trusteeship system. As an administering country, the United States has absolutely no right to conduct hydrogen bomb tests on its trust territories.

Article 76 of the United Nations Charter stipulates that "The basic objectives of the trusteeship system, in accordance with the Purposes of the United Nations laid down in Article 1 of the present Charter, shall be: (a) to further international peace and security; (b) to promote the political, economic, social, and educational advancement of the inhabitants of the trust territories, and their progressive development towards self-government or independence as may be appropriate to the particular circumstances of each territory and its peoples and the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned, and as may be provided by the terms of each trusteeship agreement..." From the provisions of the Charter, the administering authority has certain obligations to the trust territory.

However, has the U.S. government fulfilled these obligations to the islands in the South Pacific under its trusteeship? Answer: No, absolutely not! It has not done anything to "promote international peace and security"; on the contrary, it has only turned those territories into its military bases, which seriously endangers international peace and security. It has not done anything to "promote the political, economic, social, and educational advancement of the inhabitants of the trust territories" or "promote their progressive development towards self-government or independence"; on the contrary, it has only turned those territories into a place where it frequently tests atomic bomb and hydrogen bomb explosions, causing the residents to move east and west, become displaced, and suffer from the threat of death and injury year after year. In a petition to the United Nations Trusteeship Council requesting a ban on hydrogen bomb tests, the residents of the Marshall Islands appealed: "Atomic and hydrogen bomb tests have brought great suffering to the residents of the islands. Many residents are in fact permanently disabled. The United States is driving more and more Marshallese out of their land."

What a tragic sight! This is completely contrary to the obligations of the administering authority to the trust territory as stipulated in the United Nations Charter.

Not only that, the U.S. hydrogen bomb tests in the trust territories not only cause the residents' livelihoods and lives to feel pain and threat frequently, but also completely destroy a large piece of trust territory or the entire island. This is an extremely serious crime that is absolutely not allowed by the United Nations Charter. The U.S. government has no right to do this. But such a thing happened in the last U.S. hydrogen bomb test. Indian Prime Minister Nehru said in a public rally in Allahabad when referring to the petition of the residents of the Marshall Islands requesting a ban on hydrogen bomb tests: "The Marshall Islands were handed over to the Americans after the last World War. ... The Americans conducted hydrogen bomb tests on these islands. As a result: one of the islands in the Marshall Islands completely disappeared from the earth. Although the residents of this island were evacuated before the explosion, it still caused great damage to the residents of other islands near the island."

Prime Minister Nehru's conclusion is: "It is very inappropriate and extremely wrong to conduct hydrogen bomb tests on these islands that have been handed over to the United States for trusteeship. These islands are trust territories, and therefore cannot be destroyed by conducting hydrogen bomb tests." Prime Minister Nehru's remarks can undoubtedly represent the protest and condemnation of the atrocities of the United States by upright people all over the world.

Some say that according to Article 82 of the United Nations Charter and Articles 1, 5, and 13 of the trusteeship agreement signed between the United States and the United Nations on April 2, 1947, since these territories are considered "strategic areas," the U.S. government has the right to establish military bases and declare certain areas as closed areas in these territories. However, establishing military bases and closing areas are completely different from testing hydrogen bombs. Moreover, the military facilities taken by the administering authority in the strategic areas are only for the needs of security or defense, and must also be subject to the basic objectives of the trusteeship system - that is, promoting international peace and security, promoting the political, economic, social, and educational progress of the trust residents, and promoting their development towards autonomy or independence. Therefore, the U.S. government's attempt to use the strategic area as an excuse to evade its responsibility for the crimes committed in these territories or reduce its obligations to the residents of these territories is absolutely impossible. The U.S. government should bear full responsibility for the destruction of the territory and all the disasters and pains caused to the residents due to hydrogen bomb tests.

Indian Chief Representative to the United Nations Menon said in support of a Soviet draft resolution requesting the Trusteeship Council to stop the U.S. hydrogen bomb tests: "The explosion of these weapons has no benefit other than undermining the credibility of the United Nations, the cause of peace, and the well-being of the residents of these islands."

People of all countries demand that the major powers quickly reach an agreement on general disarmament and the prohibition of atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, and all weapons of mass destruction. However, the U.S. authorities completely disregard the wishes of the people of the world and insist on continuing to conduct a series of unbridled hydrogen bomb tests on the high seas and in trust territories. This crime by the United States, which violates the basic principle of freedom of the high seas in international law and violates the provisions of the United Nations Charter regarding the trusteeship system, will be justly condemned by the people of the world.

### 美国在托管岛屿试验氢弹是违反国际法原则的

    美国在托管岛屿试验氢弹是违反国际法原则的
    前远东国际军事法庭法官中国政治法律学会理事  梅汝璈
    美国当局最近宣布，将在太平洋托管岛屿——马绍尔群岛举行一系列大规模的氢弹试验。这不仅是加强“冷战”和保持国际局势紧张的挑衅行为，而且是粗暴地破坏着国际法上所公认的原则、严重地违反联合国宪章关于托管制度的违法罪行。对于这种违法罪行，世界人民必须加以制止。
    正如大家所知道，公海自由的原则是现代国际法的一个基本原则。自著名的国际法学家格罗秀士倡议以来，到了十八世纪这个原则便已被各国所公认。就在1941年8月14日英美两国所宣布的所谓大西洋宪章里，也承认了这个原则。
    根据公海自由的原则，公海是“所有国家的公共大道”，不容许受任何个别国家的控制。在公海上，不但各国的船舶和公民可以自由航行，而且他们都可以自由捕鱼和经营其他的海上事业。
    最近美国政府因为要试验许多种类的氢弹和不同投掷的方法，它在南太平洋马绍尔群岛一带所宣布的危险区域为长方形，面积达375，000平方海里。
    把375，000平方海里（约合350多万平方华里）的广大公海宣布为危险区域，阻碍各国船舶和公民的航行、捕鱼，以及其他的正常活动。这是粗暴地破坏了公海自由的原则。
    有人说，在过去的国际实践中，也有过一国独占一片公海作为实弹打靶练习的先例。姑不论这种先例的合法性怎样，但是那也只是限于很短的时期、很小的范围，它和美国这种在公海很大面积上设置危险地区、长年累月连续地用来作严重危险的原子弹和氢弹试验，是不同的。
    况且，所谓设置危险区域，在氢弹试验中，根本是骗人的，因为要预计和限制氢弹爆炸时所产生幅射能微粒飘流的方向和感染的范围是不可能的。印度驻联合国的代表说过：“印度不相信能够采取任何预防措施来防止放射作用。”大家还记得：1954年春天美国在比基尼岛试验氢弹爆炸对日本人民造成巨大的损害。据不完全的统计，美国那次氢弹试验对日本人民所产生的直接财产损失已是20亿日元以上，间接的财产损失以及精神健康和生命的损失尚不计算在内。
    无怪乎三次遭受美国原子弹灾害的日本人民谴责美国正在把他们当做实验室的“豚鼠”看待。日本人民目前已在禁止原子弹氢弹的呼吁书上签名的所以有3，300万人之多，日本国会所以能不分党派全体一致通过一项要求禁止热核子武器和限制氢弹试验的决议案，那是完全可以理解的。作者战后在日本住了三年多，并且亲自视察过第一个遭受原子弹轰炸的城市广岛，对于日本人民要求避免原子灾祸的愿望是深具同情的。
    但是美国政府却不顾日本人民的这种愿望和要求，无视日本和太平洋地区人民的生命安全，又一次地把一片广大的公海宣布为危险地区，做它试验那种为全世界人民所诅咒的大规模毁灭性武器——氢弹之用。这样，它就不仅是破坏了国际法上一项200年来各国所公认的不可争辩的原则——公海自由的原则，而且严重地犯了违反人道的罪行。
    美国政府这个罪行的严重性还有其他的一面，那便是：它彻头彻尾地违反着联合国宪章中关于托管制度的规定的文字和精神。作为一个管理国家，美国是完全没有权利在它的托管领土上进行氢弹试验的。
    联合国宪章第76条规定“托管制度之基本目的应为：（子）促进国际和平及安全。（丑）增进托管领土居民之政治、经济、社会及教育之进展；并以适合各领土及其人民之特殊情形及关系人民自由表示望愿为原则，且按照各托管协定之条款，增进其趋向自治或独立之逐渐发展。……”由宪章的条文看来，管理当局对于托管领土是负有一定的义务的。
    但是，美国政府对南太平洋的在它托管之下岛屿履行了这些义务没有？答：没有，完全没有！它没有作任何事情去“促进国际和平及安全”；相反地，它只把那些领土变成了它的军事基地，这就严重地危害着国际和平及安全。它没有作任何事情去“增进托管领土居民之政治、经济、社会及教育之进展”或“增进其趋向自治或独立之逐渐发展”；相反地，它只是把那些领土变成它经常试验原子弹和氢弹爆炸的场所，使居民们东迁西奔、流离失所，长年累月地受着死伤的威胁。在一份致联合国托管理事会的要求制止氢弹试验的请愿书上，马绍尔群岛居民呼吁：“原子弹和氢弹试验给岛上居民带来了巨大的痛苦。许多居民事实上终生成为残废。美国已在把越来越多的马绍尔群岛居民赶出他们的土地。”
    这是多么悲惨的景象！这与联合国宪章所规定管理当局对托管领土所负的义务是完全背道而驰的。
    不仅如此，美国在托管地区的氢弹试验不但使居民的生计和生命经常感受痛苦和威胁，而且它正在把一大块托管领土或整个的岛完全毁灭掉。这是极端严重的罪行，是联合国宪章所绝对不容许的。美国政府没有任何权利这样做。但是在上次美国氢弹试验中这种事情竟发生过。印度总理尼赫鲁在阿拉哈巴德公众集会演说里提到马绍尔群岛居民要求制止氢弹试验的请愿书时说过：“马绍尔群岛在上次世界大战之后交给了美国人。……美国人就是在这些群岛上进行氢弹试验的。其结果是：马绍尔群岛中有一个岛整个从地球上消失了。虽然这个岛上的居民在爆炸以前都撤离了该岛，但是它对住在该岛附近的其他各岛上的居民仍然造成了巨大的伤害”。
    尼赫鲁总理的结论是：“在这些被交给美国托管的群岛上进行氢弹试验是非常不适当并且是极端错误的事情。这些岛屿都是托管地区，因此不能因进行氢弹试验而遭到破坏。”尼赫鲁总理的这番话无疑地是可以代表全世界正直人民对美国暴行的抗议和谴责。
    有人说，根据联合国宪章第82条和美国同联合国在1947年4月2日所签订的托管协定第1条、第5条及第13条的规定，这些领土既被认为“战略防区”，美国政府便有权在这些领土上建立军事基地和宣布某些地区为封闭地区。但是建立军事基地和封闭地区同试验氢弹完全是两回事。况且托管当局在战略防区内采取军事设施也只有是为了安全或防御的需要，而且要服从于托管制度的基本目的——即促进国际和平与安全，增进托管居民的政治、经济、社会及教育之进展，增进其趋向自治或独立之发展。因此，美国政府企图以战略防区为借口而想逃避它在这些领土上所犯罪行的责任或减轻它对这些领土居民的义务，那是绝对办不到的。对由于氢弹试验而造成的领土毁灭和给居民带来的一切灾难和痛苦，美国政府是应该负完全责任的。
    印度驻联合国首席代表梅农在支持苏联代表要求托管理事会制止美国氢弹试验的一项议案时说：“这些武器的爆炸除了破坏联合国的威信、和平事业和这些岛上居民的福利以外，没有一点好处。”
    各国人民要求各大国间迅速对普遍裁减军备和禁止原子弹、氢弹及一切大规模毁灭性的武器达成协议。但是美国当局却完全无视世界人民的这种愿望，一意孤行地要继续在公海上、在托管领土上肆无忌惮地进行一系列的氢弹试验。美国这一破坏国际法上公海自由的基本原则、违反联合国宪章关于托管制度的规定的罪行，将遭受到全世界人民的正义谴责。
