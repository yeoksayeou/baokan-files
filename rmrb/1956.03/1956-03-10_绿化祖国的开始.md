    The Beginning of Greening the Motherland
    By Our Correspondent Zhu Bo
    March 7th was a day worth remembering. At 7 a.m., the representatives attending the Five Provinces (Regions) Youth Afforestation Conference, along with more than 15,000 young people and residents of Yan'an City, had prepared their afforestation tools. They held high red flags, beat drums and gongs, and gathered in the South Gate District and Yangjialing and other places, waiting for the afforestation headquarters to issue the order to green Yan'an.
    The youth representatives and the youth from various organizations and schools in Yan'an crossed the turbulent Yan River at 9 a.m. and gathered next to the former Party Central Auditorium. At this time, every youth representative was in high spirits. Because they all thought that Chairman Mao had nurtured them to grow up here, today, they were determined to use their own hands to green Yangjialing. They proposed to quickly grow lush green forests, fragrant flowers, and sweet fruits in the place where the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao lived, making Yan'an a world-famous scenic spot.
    The order to march towards the barren mountains sounded, this was the call to green the motherland. The afforestation army of more than 15,000 people, holding high red flags, raced to the Pagoda Mountain, the Qingliang Mountain, the Phoenix Mountain, and the mountain tops above the cave dwellings where Chairman Mao lived. On the various mountain tops, youth representatives from all over the country took off their coats and began their intense labor with hoes and iron shovels.
    The youth representatives of Gansu and Shaanxi Provinces issued a challenge to the youth of other provinces and Yan'an, proposing to plant more and plant well, ensuring that every tree could survive... As soon as this news was transmitted to various mountain tops through the microphone, the letters of response from the youth representatives of other provinces and the youth of Yan'an came. The youth representatives of Shanxi Province even compiled the conditions of the response into a clapper talk: "Planting trees and making forests requires technology, managing planting, managing survival, managing protection..." The horizontal ditches opened by the youth representatives of Gansu Province were very neat, each tree was planted upright, and they ensured that pedestrians on the ditch bank would not loosen the soil. Good news came from the youth representatives of Henan, they completed the task of planting seven trees per person in one and a half hours, and then went to help the younger brothers and sisters of Yan'an No. 1 Elementary School. When the youth representatives of Gansu Province were about to complete the tree planting task, they organized a support afforestation commando team to support the youth representatives of other provinces. The slogan "Turn barren mountains into green mountains, turn muddy water into clear water" was shouted all over the mountains and plains. After the youth's labor, rows of young locusts and pines and cypresses appeared on the various mountain slopes.
    "One tree planted, one heart planted, plant it in Yangjialing." This is the "Xintianyou" folk song composed by the youth representatives during tree planting. Youth representatives from all over the country dedicated their most precious flowers, trees and tree species to Yan'an. Here are 1,000 plants of 17 kinds of flowers and trees donated by the youth of Zhejiang to the conference, including sweet-scented osmanthus, wintersweet, peach blossom, snow pine, peacock cypress, and ginkgo; there are poplars donated to Yan'an by the youth of Inner Mongolia, and more than 6,000 privet, Chinese cedar and small-leaf willow donated to Yan'an by the youth of Jiangxi, as well as dozens of tree species donated to Yan'an by the youth of all provinces. These flowers and trees were planted by the youth of Yan'an Middle School and the children of Yan'an Nursery Primary School, under the guidance of the youth technicians of the Yan'an Prefectural Forestry Bureau and the Hangzhou Nursery of Zhejiang Province, in the courtyard of the former Party Central Auditorium and the Party Central Office Building. The children of the Nursery Primary School also planted a row of ginkgo and poplar trees in front of the cave dwellings where Chairman Mao lived. They proposed to guarantee that these flowers and trees from all over the country would sprout, grow, and remain evergreen forever in the revolutionary holy land - Yan'an.
    The tree planting and afforestation activities of the youth representatives and the youth of Yan'an are only the beginning of greening the motherland. Soon, a larger-scale movement to green the motherland will be launched throughout the country.

    绿化祖国的开始
    本报记者　朱波
    3月7日，这是值得记忆的一天。早晨7时，出席五省（区）青年造林大会的代表，和延安市的青年、群众共15，000多人，就把造林的工具准备好了，他们高举着红旗，打着锣鼓，分别集中在南关区和杨家岭等地，等待着造林指挥部发出绿化延安的命令。
    青年代表们和延安各机关学校的青年，都在上午9时渡过湍急的延河，集中在过去党中央大礼堂的旁边。这时候，每个青年代表的情绪都非常高涨。因为他们都想到毛主席就在这里培养他们长大成人，今天，他们决心用自己的双手，把杨家岭绿化起来。他们提出，让党中央和毛主席住过的地方，很快地生长起绿油油的树林，开出香喷喷的鲜花，结出甜蜜蜜的果子，使延安成为世界闻名的风景区。
    向荒山进军的号令响了，这是绿化祖国的号声，15，000多人组成的造林大军，高举红旗，争先恐后地向宝塔山，向清凉山，向凤凰山，向毛主席住过的窑洞上边的各山头跑去。在各个山头上，来自各地的青年代表们，把外衣都脱掉了，他们抡起镢头和铁锨，开始了紧张的劳动。
    甘肃、陕西省青年代表向其它各省和延安青年提出了挑战书，他们提出要栽的多，栽的好，保证每棵树都能成活……这个消息刚刚通过麦克风传到各山头，其它各省的青年代表和延安青年的应战书就传来了。山西省青年代表，还把应战条件编成快板，“植树造林讲技术，管栽管活管保护……”甘肃省的青年代表们开的水平沟非常整齐，每棵树都栽的端正，并且做到沟畔行人不松土。河南青年代表的捷报传来了，他们用了一个半小时的时间，完成了每人植七棵树的任务后，又去帮助延安第一完小的小弟弟和小妹妹们。甘肃省青年代表快要完成植树任务的时候，又组织了支援造林突击队，去支援其它省的青年代表。满山遍野喊出“让秃山变绿山，让浑水变清水”的口号。经过青年们的劳动之后，各个山坡上，出现了一行行幼小的洋槐和松柏。
    “一棵棵树种一棵棵心，把它种在杨家岭。”这是青年代表在植树的时候编出来的“信天游”。来自全国各地的青年代表，把他们最名贵的花木和树种献给延安。这里有浙江青年献给大会的四季桂花、腊梅、碧桃、雪松、孔雀柏、银杏等共17种1.000株花木；有内蒙古青年献给延安的白杨，还有江西青年献给延安的6，000多株女贞、柳杉和小叶柳，以及全国各省青年献给延安的几十种树种。这些花木由延安中学的青年和延安保育小学的少年们，在延安专署林业局和浙江省杭州苗圃的青年技术员指导之下，栽种在过去党中央大礼堂、党中央办公大楼的院内。保育小学的少年们，还在毛主席住过的窑洞前边，种上了一排银杏和白杨。他们提出保证这些来自各地的花木，在革命圣地——延安，发芽成长，万年常青。
    青年代表和延安青年植树造林的活动，只是绿化祖国的开始，不久，全国各地就要开展更大规模的绿化祖国的运动。
