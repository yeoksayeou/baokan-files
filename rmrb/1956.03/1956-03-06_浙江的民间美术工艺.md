    Zhejiang's Folk Art Crafts
    Liu Fan, Zheng Feng
    The "Zhejiang Province Folk Art Crafts Exhibition" which opened at the Zhejiang Museum in Hangzhou during the Spring Festival, displayed more than 600 representative works of folk art crafts from all over Zhejiang, including: stone carvings from Qingtian, wood carvings from Dongyang, turned bamboo carvings from Huangyan and Fenghua, oil clay sculptures and inlays from Wenzhou, bamboo weaving from Dongyang and Shaoxing, golden silk grass hats from Yuyao, porcelain from Longquan and Wenzhou, silk and brocade from Hangzhou, embroidery from Wenzhou, block-printed calico from Jinhua, Jiaxing, and Ningbo, paper-cuts and wheat stalk collages from Yongkang and Pujiang, as well as clothing and ornaments of ethnic minorities in the Zhejiang area, and so on.
    These folk art crafts are all beautiful and delicate. The Qingtian shallow-carved landscape pattern book clip is a book clip with a three-dimensional landscape scene carved on a stone surface less than one point (of a Chinese inch) thick. The "Havoc in Heaven" wood carving wall hanging created by the old Dongyang artist Li Shouming depicts clouds, figures, palace buildings, and other images carved in many layers on a wooden board. Pan A'ming, a Wenzhou carpenter's posthumous work, "Flower and Bird Bamboo Filament Inlay" hanging screen, is the origin of Wenzhou carving and inlay. It is made of meticulously patterned strips of bamboo filaments, half a point wide and two points thick, joined together, and inlaid with boxwood carvings of flowers and birds. Dongyang artist Ma Zhengxing used exquisite techniques to weave nearly ten thousand bamboo filaments as thin as hair into a "Yuanbao Basket." These works, which demonstrate the high artistic skills of Chinese folk artists, enjoy a high reputation both domestically and abroad.
    Zhejiang folk art crafts have a long history. Zhejiang silk fabrics were already famous in the Tang Dynasty, Qingtian stone carvings were very popular in the Southern Song Dynasty, and Longquan porcelain had also become one of the five famous kilns in China in the Southern Song Dynasty. Over the generations, hardworking and intelligent folk artists have been good at using local materials and utilizing the characteristics of various materials to create all kinds of exquisite crafts. Zhejiang's special products, such as stone, bamboo, and wood, are also diverse. For example, the Qingtian stone produced in Qingtian includes dozens of varieties such as gelatin stone, chicken blood stone, and fengmen stone. Qingtian stone carvings use the natural colors and patterns of these stone materials to design and carve various artistic appreciation pieces and daily necessities such as vases, flower pots, lamp stands, cigarette cases, and ashtrays. There are many items and styles, about 300 varieties. The bamboo and wood produced in the mountainous areas of Zhejiang, such as mao bamboo, dan bamboo, boxwood, camphor wood, etc., are all good materials for carving.
    In the old society, most of China's folk art crafts were for the enjoyment of the ruling class, and folk artists lived impoverished lives under exploitation. In particular, during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, folk art crafts were severely devastated, and many artists were forced to become unemployed or change careers. Zhejiang was no exception. After liberation, under the care and cultivation of the Party and the People's Government, folk art crafts in various places rapidly recovered and developed. In Dongyang, Qingtian, Wenzhou, Huangyan, Fenghua and other seven counties in Zhejiang, 12 art craft production cooperatives were successively organized, and old folk artists were systematically organized to study in the Folk Art Research Class of the East China Branch of the Central Academy of Fine Arts. Professional art workers were also organized to learn from folk art and conduct research and sorting out work. The enthusiasm of folk artists for artistic creation has been greatly improved. Last year, Lin Yanfu, an old artist from the Wenzhou Carving Production Cooperative, creatively completed a new work on historical themes, "King Wu-Yue Shooting the Tide" (Qingtian stone carving), by trying to combine landscape carving and figure carving. Nan Shireen and Chen Heting, who used to specialize in clay sculptures of Bodhisattvas, also created sculptures such as "Wu Song Fighting the Tiger," "Old Woman Interpreting Poems," and "Reading to Grandpa."
    Zhejiang's folk art crafts are rich, and the achievements in recent years have been very significant. The province-wide folk art crafts exhibition held on this basis is a comprehensive review. It will summarize experience and promote the continued rapid development of future work.

    浙江的民间美术工艺
    刘凡  正峰
    春节在杭州浙江博物馆开幕的 “浙江省民间美术工艺品展览会”，展出了浙江各地民间美术工艺的代表作品600多种，其中有：青田的石刻、东阳的木雕，黄岩、奉化的翻簧竹刻，温州的油泥塑和镶嵌，东阳、绍兴等地的竹编，余姚的金丝草帽，龙泉、温州的瓷器，杭州的丝绸、织锦，温州的刺绣，金华、嘉兴、宁波的纸板、木板套色印花布，永康、浦江一带的剪纸和麦秆剪贴，以及浙江地区少数民族的服装、装饰品等等。
    这些民间美术工艺品都很优美、细致。青田浅刻山水图案书夹，是在不到一分厚的石面上雕出立体的山水风景图的书夹。东阳老艺人厉守铭创作的“大闹天宫”木雕壁挂，在木板上以很多层次雕刻出云霞、人物和宫殿建筑等等形象。温州木工潘阿明的遗作“花鸟竹丝镶嵌”挂屏，是温州雕嵌的起源，它是由半分宽，二分厚的篾丝接榫成精密的图案，再镶嵌上黄杨木雕的花鸟而成的。东阳的艺人马正兴以精巧的手法把近万根细如发丝的竹丝编织成“元宝篮”。这些表现了我国民间艺人高度艺术技巧的作品，在国内和国外都享有很高的声誉。
    浙江民间美术工艺有着悠久的历史。浙江丝织品在唐代便已著名，青田石刻在南宋已很盛行，龙泉的瓷器也在南宋便已成为我国五大名窑之一。历代勤劳智慧的民间艺人们，善于就地取材，利用各种不同材料的特点制造各种精美的工艺品。浙江特产的石头、竹、木等种类也多，例如青田所产的青田石就有冻石、鸡血石和疯门石等数十种，青田的石刻就是利用这些石料的自然彩色和花纹来设计雕琢成各种美术欣赏品和花瓶、花盆、灯台、烟盒、烟缸等日用品，名目、式样很多，约有300多种。浙江山区盛产的竹、木如毛竹、淡竹、黄杨木、樟木等等，都是雕刻的好材料。
    我国民间美术工艺品在旧社会大多是供统治阶级享受用的，民间艺人们过着被剥削的贫困生活。特别是抗日战争时期和国民党反动派统治时期，民间美术工艺遭到了极大的摧残，许多艺人被迫失业或改行，浙江当然也不例外。解放后，在党和人民政府的关怀培植下，各地民间美术工艺迅速恢复和发展起来。在浙江东阳、青田、温州、黄岩、奉化等七县先后组织了12个美术工艺生产合作社，并且有计划地组织民间老艺人进中央美术学院华东分院民间美术研究班学习，还组织专业美术工作者向民间美术学习和进行研究整理工作。民间艺人们艺术创造的积极性大大提高，温州雕刻生产合作社老艺人林岩福去年尝试把山水雕刻和人物雕刻相结合起来创造性地完成了一件表现历史题材的新作品“吴越王射潮图”（青田石刻），过去专做泥塑菩萨的艺人南式仁和陈鹤亭，也创作了“武松打虎”、“老妇解诗”和“读给爷爷听”等雕刻作品。
    浙江的民间美术工艺是丰富的，近几年来的成就更是十分显著。在这样的基础上举行的全省规模的民间美术工艺品展览，是一次全面的检阅，它将要总结经验，推动今后的工作继续迅速地向前发展。
