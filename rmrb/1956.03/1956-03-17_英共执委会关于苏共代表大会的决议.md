Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 13th: According to today's London "Daily Worker," the Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain adopted a resolution on the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in London on the 10th.

The resolution said: Khrushchev's report reiterated the Soviet Union's policy of peace. It shows that Soviet leaders and the Soviet people hope to maintain peaceful and friendly relations with the people of all countries, especially with the people of Great Britain. By showing that the strength of the people and the peace movement is strong enough to prevent a third world war, the Congress has increased the new confidence of all peace-loving people and strengthened the worldwide movement for peace.

The resolution said: The Sixth Five-Year Plan adopted by the 20th Congress of the CPSU provides the Soviet people with a prospect completely different from that of Great Britain. The resolution pointed out that the Congress has made a great contribution to the workers of all countries who are fighting to end capitalism and establish socialism in terms of the peaceful transition of revolution.

The resolution also said that the Congress has contributed to ending the division and discord in the working-class movement, which only helps the capitalists and harms the cause of socialism.

The resolution concluded: The 20th Congress has greatly strengthened the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This meeting is a challenge and inspiration to the working people of the world to redouble their efforts for peace and socialism.

    英共执委会关于苏共代表大会的决议
    据新华社柏林13日电　据今天伦敦“工人日报”消息，英国共产党执行委员会10日在伦敦通过了一项关于苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的决议。
    决议说：赫鲁晓夫在报告中重申了苏联的和平政策。它表明：苏联领袖们和苏联人民希望同所有各国人民、特别是同英国人民保持和平与友好的关系。由于表明了人民与和平运动的力量强大得足以防止第三次世界大战，代表大会使所有爱好和平的人们增加了新的信心并且加强了全世界争取和平的运动。
    决议说：苏共第二十次代表大会通过的第六个五年计划为苏联人民提供了一幅和英国完全不同的前景。决议指出：代表大会在关于革命和平转变方面已经给为结束资本主义和建立社会主义而斗争的各国工人作出了伟大的贡献。
    决议还说：代表大会对结束工人阶级运动中的分裂和不和现象作了贡献，这种分裂和不和现象目前只会帮助资本家和损害社会主义的事业。
    决议最后说：第二十次代表大会已经大大地加强了苏联共产党。这次会议是对全世界的劳动人民为和平和社会主义而加倍努力的挑战和鼓舞。
