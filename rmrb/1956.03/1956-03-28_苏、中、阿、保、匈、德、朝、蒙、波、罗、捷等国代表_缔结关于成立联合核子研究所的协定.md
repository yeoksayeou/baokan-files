Xinhua News Agency, March 27th dispatch from Moscow: The international conference on the establishment of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research concluded on the 26th and issued a final communiqué.

The conference was attended by representatives from the Soviet Union, China, Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, North Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia.

The communiqué stated that the plenipotentiary representatives of the governments attending the conference believed in the great significance of the peaceful utilization of atomic energy and the necessity for scientists from various countries to cooperate in theoretical and experimental research in nuclear physics to expand the possibilities for the peaceful utilization of atomic energy. The representatives of the countries concluded an agreement on the establishment of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. The agreement stipulates that an international scientific research organization be established, named the "Joint Institute for Nuclear Research," and located in the Soviet Union.

The Joint Institute for Nuclear Research will operate in accordance with its charter, which will be drafted by the Directorate of the Institute and approved by the governments of the member states of the Joint Institute. Each signatory country is an equal member state of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. In the future, other countries willing to join the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, after declaring their agreement to the terms of the signed agreement, shall become equal member states of the Joint Institute upon the approval of a majority of the member states of the Institute.

In accordance with the signed agreement, the Government of the Soviet Socialist Republics transfers the following assets to the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research: the Nuclear Problems Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, equipped with a synchrocyclotron capable of accelerating protons to an energy of 680 million electron volts; the Electrophysical Laboratory of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, equipped with a synchrophasotron expected to accelerate protons to an energy of 10 billion electron volts, as well as all equipment, basic buildings, auxiliary buildings, administrative buildings, and housing.

The government delegations of the countries participating in the conference very gladly accepted the proposal made by the Soviet Union to transfer the Nuclear Problems Institute and the Electrophysical Laboratory of the Soviet Academy of Sciences to the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. In this way, scientists from the countries participating in the conference will be able to conduct research in nuclear physics using the most modern and advanced equipment in the near future.

To enable the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research to further expand research in nuclear physics, the agreement stipulates the addition of the following construction projects:

	I. A theoretical physics laboratory, including a computing department and electronic computers;

	II. A neutron physics laboratory equipped with an experimental nuclear reactor capable of emitting a very dense neutron flux;

	III. A cyclotron for accelerating multicharged ions of various elements and conducting ion experiments;

as well as other experimental equipment and laboratories.

The agreement stipulates that the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research shall have one director and two deputy directors, elected from among the scientists of the member states by a majority vote. The director shall serve a term of three years, and the deputy directors shall serve terms of two years.

To discuss and approve plans for scientific research work, the results of the implementation of the plans, and other issues related to the scientific work of the institute, an academic council of the institute shall be established. Members of the council shall be appointed by the member states of the institute.

The agreement stipulates that each member state of the Nuclear Institute shall pay annual dues as the institute's funds and for the construction of new scientific research projects at the institute, and shall provide material guarantees to the institute.

The agreement determines the corresponding proportions of these expenses to be borne by each country. At the same time, the amount of these expenses borne by the member states of the institute shall not affect the degree of participation of the member states of the institute in scientific research work and in the management of the institute.

To discuss and approve the institute's budget and to supervise the institute's financial activities, a financial committee composed of representatives from each member state of the institute shall be established.

The conference unanimously elected Professor Dmitry Ivanovich Blokhintsev, Corresponding Academician of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian Republic, as the Director of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, and unanimously elected Polish scientist Professor Marian Danysz and Professor Václav Votruba, Corresponding Academician of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, as Deputy Directors.

The conference sent a telegram inviting the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to participate in the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research and instructed the institute's leadership to discuss the issue of inviting other countries to participate in the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research and to make recommendations to the governments of the member states of the institute on this issue.

Xinhua News Agency, March 27th dispatch from Moscow: The agreement on the establishment of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research was signed on March 26, 1956, in the building of the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in Moscow.

The heads of the government delegations of the countries participating in the conference on the establishment of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research signed the agreement.

The signing ceremony was attended by members of the government delegations of the participating countries, as well as the ambassadors of Bulgaria, Hungary, China, North Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia to the Soviet Union, and the Chargés d'Affaires ad interim of Albania and the German Democratic Republic to the Soviet Union.

Also present at the signing ceremony were Professor Blokhintsev, Director of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, and responsible personnel from the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

After the signing of the agreement, Academician Topchiev delivered a brief speech.

    苏、中、阿、保、匈、德、朝、蒙、波、罗、捷等国代表
    缔结关于成立联合核子研究所的协定
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：关于成立联合核子研究所问题的国际会议已经在二十六日结束，并且发表了最后公报。
    参加这次会议的有苏联、中国、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、德意志民主共和国、朝鲜、蒙古、波兰、罗马尼亚和捷克斯洛伐克等国的代表。
    公报说，出席会议的各国政府的全权代表认为和平利用原子能有重大的意义，认为各国科学家有必要在核子物理学的理论研究和实验研究工作中进行合作，以便扩大和平利用原子能的可能性。各国代表缔结了一项关于成立联合核子研究所的协定。协定规定：成立一个国际性的科学研究组织，定名为“联合核子研究所”，设在苏联。
    联合核子研究所将根据章程进行工作，章程草案由研究所所长室起草，经联合研究所成员国政府批准。各缔约国是联合核子研究所的平权会员国。将来其他国家愿意参加联合核子研究所者，声明同意所签订的协定的条款，经研究所大多数成员国同意后即成为联合研究所的平权会员国。
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府根据所签订的协定把下列资财移交给联合核子研究所：苏联科学院核子问题研究所，其中装备有能把质子加速到能量达六亿八千万电子伏特的同步回旋加速器；苏联科学院电气物理实验室，其中装备有预计能把质子加速到能量达一百亿电子伏特的同步稳相加速器以及一切设备、基本建筑、辅助建筑、行政管理建筑和房屋。
    参加会议的各国政府代表团非常满意地接受了苏联提出的关于把苏联科学院的核子问题研究所和电气物理实验室移交给联合核子研究所的建议。这样，参加会议的各国科学家就有可能在最近就利用最现代化的和完善的设备来进行核子物理学的研究工作。
    为了使联合核子研究所进一步展开核子物理学方面的研究工作，协定规定增加下列建设：
    一、包括设有计算部和电子计算机的理论物理学实验室；
    二、安装有能够放射密度很大的中子流的实验核子反应堆的中子物理学实验室；
    三、加速各种元素的多电荷的离子和进行离子试验工作用的回旋加速器；
    以及其他试验设备和实验室。
    协定规定，联合核子研究所设所长一人，副所长两人，由成员国以多数票在它们的科学家中选出，所长任期三年，副所长任期两年。
    为了讨论和批准科学研究工作的计划、计划执行的结果和有关研究所科学工作的其他问题，成立一个研究所的学术委员会。委员会委员由研究所成员国任命。
    协定规定，核子研究所每一个成员国每年应缴纳会费作为研究所的经费和研究所建设新的科学研究项目的用款，并且对研究所提供物质保证。
    协定确定了各国担负这些开支的相应的比重。同时，研究所成员国负担这些开支的多少，并不影响研究所各成员国参加科学研究工作和对研究所的管理方面的程度。
    为了讨论和批准研究所的预算以及为了对研究所财政活动进行监督，成立一个由研究所各成员国代表组成的财政委员会。
    会议一致选出乌克兰共和国科学院通讯院士、教授德米特里·伊凡诺维奇·布洛欣泽夫博士为联合核子研究所所长，并且一致选出波兰科学家、教授马里安·丹?什博士和捷克斯洛伐克科学院通讯院士、教授瓦茨拉夫·沃特鲁巴博士为副所长。
    会议致电邀请越南民主共和国政府参加联合核子研究所，并责成研究所领导机构讨论邀请其他国家参加联合核子研究所的问题，并且对研究所成员国政府提出有关这个问题的建议。
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：关于成立联合核子研究所的协定于1956年3月26日在莫斯科苏联科学院主席团大楼签字。
    参加研究成立联合核子研究所问题的会议的各国政府代表团团长都在协定上签了字。
    出席签字仪式的有：会议参加国的政府代表团人员以及保加利亚、匈牙利、中国、朝鲜、蒙古、波兰、罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克等国驻苏联大使以及阿尔巴尼亚和德意志民主共和国驻苏联临时代办。
