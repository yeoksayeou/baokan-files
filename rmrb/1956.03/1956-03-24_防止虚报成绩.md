To Prevent Falsifying Achievements
    Nan Cun
    In mid-February, the XinHui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Guangdong Province organized cadres to go to the countryside to inspect spring plowing preparations and discovered that some districts and townships had the phenomenon of falsely reporting production achievements. For example, regarding the work of digging rice roots in the Third and Seventh Districts, district staff reported to the county that 90% had been completed, but in reality, many townships had not completed that much, with some only completing 20% to 30%, and some not having started at all. Similar phenomena were also found in some areas of Fujian Province. For example, the ChiYuan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Minqing County recently received a report from the ChiYuan Township work team stating that the amount of fertilizer accumulated in the township had exceeded the amount of fertilizer needed for spring plowing by 25%, reaching 65% of the annual fertilizer requirement. The District Committee sent people to inspect three agricultural cooperatives in ChiYuan Township, and the cooperative with the most accumulated fertilizer only reached 36% of the annual fertilizer requirement, while the worst only reached 27%. All three cooperatives were still far short of the fertilizer needed for spring plowing.
    How does this phenomenon of falsely reporting achievements occur? The main reason is that some rural staff members, believing that after the high tide of cooperativization, the masses' enthusiasm for production is very high, and that no work is a problem, have floated away from practical work and no longer conduct investigations and research, let alone carry out in-depth and meticulous leadership work. Hearing that the production achievements of one or two cooperatives or one or two townships are great, they infer that the production achievements of the entire township and the entire district are also great. When superiors want reports, they use the situation of one or two cooperatives or one or two townships to extrapolate, substituting the part for the whole. Obviously, this approach by these comrades is extremely harmful. They blind themselves, and they also blind their superiors. As a result, everyone is "worry-free," but the masses lose leadership.
    Following the high tide of cooperativization, the masses' enthusiasm for production is very high, and the achievements in preparing for spring plowing are great. This is certainly the main situation in the countryside at present, but it must not be assumed that there are no problems with production. In fact, because most agricultural cooperatives are newly established and are large in scale, their experience in operation and management is still insufficient, and new problems are constantly arising. Many cooperatives have already experienced low labor efficiency or rough work quality due to the unsound organization of labor. If we do not help them solve problems in time, the completion of production increase plans will be in danger of falling through. Although this phenomenon of falsely reporting achievements has only been discovered in a few areas, given the new situation of a nationwide rural production upsurge, there are undoubtedly people in other regions who are blindly optimistic and exaggerate achievements and conceal shortcomings. Rural leaders in various localities should pay attention to maintaining a clear head, frequently go deep into the countryside to inspect work, understand the situation, solve problems, help cadres overcome the work style of not going deep into reality, and prevent the occurrence of falsely reporting achievements.

    防止虚报成绩
    南存
    中共广东省新会县委会在二月中旬组织干部下乡检查春耕准备工作，发现有些区乡有虚报生产成绩的现象。如三、七两区挖稻根的工作，区工作人员向县里汇报说已完成了90％，实际上许多乡没有完成这么多，部分乡只完成了20％到30％，有的乡还根本没有开始。福建省有的地区也发现类似现象。如闽清县中共池园区委会最近接到池园乡工作组的汇报说，全乡积肥量已超过春耕用肥量25％，达到全年需肥量的65％。区委会派人到池园乡检查了三个农业合作社，积肥最多的只达全年需肥量的36％，差的只达到27％。三个社春耕用肥都还差得很多。
    这种虚报成绩的现象是怎样发生的呢？主要原因是一些农村工作人员，以为在合作化高潮以后，群众生产情绪很高，什么工作都不成问题了，于是他们从实际工作中飘浮上来，不再进行调查研究，更不去作深入细致的领导工作。听到一两个合作社、一两个乡的生产成绩很大，便以此推断全乡全区的生产成绩也很大。上级要汇报，他们就凭一两个社、一两个乡的情况去推算，以部分代替全体。很显然，这些同志的这种作法是极其有害的。他们把自己的眼睛蒙蔽起来，同时也蒙蔽了上级。结果大家都“高枕无忧”，群众却失去了领导。
    继合作化高潮以后，群众生产情绪很高，备耕工作成绩很大，这固然是当前农村的主要情况，但决不能因此就认为生产没有问题了。事实上，因为大部分农业合作社都是新建的，而且规模都比较大，经营管理经验都还不足，新的问题不断发生。许多合作社因为劳力组织还不够健全，已经发生了劳动效率不高或做活质量粗糙的现象。如果不及时帮助它们解决问题，增产计划的完成就有落空的危险。目前这种虚报成绩的现象，虽然还只是在少数地区发现，但是由于全国农村正处在生产高潮的新形势面前，盲目乐观而夸大成绩、掩饰缺点的人，在其他地区并不是没有的。各地农村领导人员，应该注意保持清醒的头脑，经常深入农村，检查工作，了解情况，解决问题，帮助干部克服不深入实际的工作作风，防止发生虚报成绩的现象。
