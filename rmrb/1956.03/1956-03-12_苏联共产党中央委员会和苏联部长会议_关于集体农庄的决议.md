The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union studied the issues of the agricultural labor cooperative charter and further promoting the initiative of collective farmers in organizing collective farm production and managing collective farm affairs, as well as the issue of monthly cash advances to collective farmers and supplementary labor remuneration for collective farms, and adopted the following resolutions on these two issues.

On the Agricultural Labor Cooperative Charter and Further Promoting
the Initiative of Collective Farmers in Organizing Collective
Farm Production and Managing Collective Farm Affairs

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union believe that striving to develop and consolidate the collective ownership economy of collective farms, and rapidly improving all agricultural production sectors on the basis of further increasing labor productivity, increasing state organizational and technical assistance to collective farms, and enabling collective farms and collective farmers to exercise initiative in organizing and managing the collective economy according to local conditions, is a matter of paramount importance.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the Soviet government, our country implemented overall collectivization on the basis of industrialization. A new socialist system has been established in the countryside, fundamentally changing the production and life foundations of tens of millions of farmers.

In our country, large-scale collective agricultural production has replaced scattered and primitive peasant economies, making it possible to widely apply new technologies, utilize all achievements of advanced science, and produce more commodity products. The collective farm system has created new socialist labor organizations and higher labor productivity, opening up a broad path to a prosperous life for all workers in the Soviet countryside. When organizing collective farms, the Communist Party and the Soviet state have always believed that the highest labor productivity and further consolidation of new social discipline in collective farms can only be achieved on the basis of genuine initiative on the part of male and female collective farmers and their active participation in the management and administration of labor cooperatives.

The Model Charter of the Agricultural Labor Cooperative adopted by the Second Congress of Collective Farm Members has great significance for consolidating the collective farm system. This charter summarizes the experience accumulated in collective management during this period. More than 20 years have passed since the charter was adopted. During this period, tremendous changes have taken place in the rural life of collective farms, and new and rich experience has been accumulated in building a multi-sectoral public economy. The political consciousness of collective farmers has been raised, their understanding of the interests of the whole people has deepened, and the alliance between the working class and the peasantry under the leading role of the working class has been further consolidated. A new material and technical foundation for collective farm production has been established.

Now, almost all field work on collective farms has been completely mechanized, and the mechanization of animal husbandry and other production sectors of collective farms is constantly improving. The mutual relationship between collective farms and machine tractor stations—now the decisive force in improving the collective ownership economy of collective farms—has expanded and consolidated. Work has been carried out in the country to merge collective farms. Machine tractor stations and collective farms have been strengthened by the addition of leading cadres and expert cadres. Now, the leaders of machine tractor stations and collective farms are generally experienced staff members who are capable of practically solving problems in organizing large-scale multi-sectoral economies. The state is implementing significant measures to increase the material interests of collective farms and collective farm members in developing agricultural production. A new system has been implemented in agricultural planning, enabling collective farms to plan the development of the entire public economy themselves based on local conditions, on the basis of fulfilling state-prescribed commodity output tasks, in order to obtain the maximum amount of agricultural products with the least expenditure of labor and funds per hundred hectares of agricultural land.

Now, collective farm construction has risen to a new stage in its development process. Collective farms must solve new tasks in further increasing agricultural production. In this situation, the Model Charter of the Agricultural Labor Cooperative can no longer include all aspects of the diverse life and activities of collective farms, and often limits their initiative, limiting their initiative in establishing new systems for managing the public economy that best suit the specific conditions of collective farm work.

In many letters written to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union by collective farms and collective farm members, suggestions have been made to revise certain articles of the Model Charter of the Agricultural Labor Cooperative, especially suggestions on the rules and scale for the allocation of private plots, the number of livestock owned privately by collective farm households, the rules for using collective farm pastures, determining the minimum number of labor days, expelling collective farm members from collective farms, distributing income, expanding the powers of the collective farm management committee, etc. Collective farm members correctly point out that the provisions in the Model Charter of the Agricultural Labor Cooperative for distributing private plots to collective farm households contradict the task of consolidating collective farms organizationally and economically, because this provision does not ask how much the members of the collective farm who have labor power participate in the public economy. Often, lazy farmers with very few labor days, and sometimes even people who have in fact severed all labor ties with the collective farm, own large private plots, use the collective farm's pastures, and enjoy other preferential treatments stipulated for collective farm members, but they do not fulfill the basic obligations of collective farm members.

As a result, the consequences of operating the collective economy and all responsibilities for fulfilling the obligations undertaken by the collective farm to the state fall on those hard-working members, while those lazy members who do not participate in the labor of the farm's public economy enjoy all the preferential treatments of collective farm members, developing their private economy to the detriment of the public economy, which is to the detriment of the common interests of all collective farm members.

The entire experience of collective farm construction convincingly shows that only by striving to develop the collective farm's public production can the personal needs of collective farm members be most fully satisfied. The private plots of members should be of a supplementary nature and are necessary until the collective farm's public economy has not yet developed sufficiently to fully satisfy both the public needs of the collective farm and the personal requirements of the members. Each collective farm should strive to continuously develop the public economy, produce more various agricultural products, and, on this basis, increasingly fully meet the needs of the state, the collective farm, and the collective farm members for these products. We already have many collective farms whose agricultural product production has reached such a level that the in-kind and cash income that members receive from the public economy per labor day has increased to the point that members do not need to worry about needing a certain amount of private supplementary economy as stipulated by the charter.

Therefore, it is necessary to strive to continuously increase the role of the public economy in the income of all collective farm members, with all the needs of members being basically met by the public economy. The income earned from participating in collective farm production should become the main part of the members' total income, while the members' private plots and the income obtained from them can in fact only play a supplementary role, mainly to meet the members' personal needs for fresh vegetables, fruits, berries, etc. Therefore, these private plots can only be opened up as gardens and berry orchards, as a decoration for the lives of collective farm members.

Many collective farm members have written letters requesting that collective farms themselves have the right to decide the number of private plots for collective farm members, as well as to solve other internal problems of the collective farm, in order to facilitate the rapid rise of the public economy and increase collective farm members' material well-being.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union pointed out that in many regions, local Party, Soviet, and agricultural organs have facts of destroying collective farm democracy, and they force collective farms to accept general organizational forms and economic standards that do not conform to the specific conditions of production and the level of development of the farm. Sometimes many problems in the internal life of the collective farm, such as the organization of production teams and production groups, the labor quotas and remuneration of collective farm members, the appointment of production team leaders and other personnel of the collective farm, etc., are stipulated from above, and such matters must be decided with very careful consideration of the conditions of each farm. Instead of skillfully helping collective farm members to correctly organize labor according to the specific conditions of each farm, they force collective farms to accept immutable work quotas and piece-rate methods, uniform standards, and organizational systems of management agencies, etc., despite the great differences in the working conditions of each collective farm.

Many staff members have forgotten that the agricultural labor cooperative is a collective economy voluntarily formed by farmers, and the members of the labor cooperative manage the products and property of the labor cooperative themselves, working in accordance with the laws of the Soviet regime, the resolutions of the Party and the government, and in accordance with the interests of the state, the collective farm, and the collective farm members. Because they forget this, these staff members do not promptly suggest and advise collective farms on how to correctly organize and manage the economy, but instead do not deeply study the situation in collective farms, do not pay attention to the characteristics of each individual farm, and rarely provide specific assistance to collective farms.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union have decided:

Taking into account the following major changes that have taken place in collective farm villages since the adoption of the Model Charter of the Agricultural Labor Cooperative: a new material and technical foundation has been established, rich experience in organizing and managing the collective economy has been accumulated, the political consciousness of collective farmers has been raised, and the 30,000 experienced cadres dispatched from the cities and the experienced cadres who have grown up from collective farmers and are able to manage large-scale multi-sectoral economies and correctly solve problems in managing the collective economy in practice have consolidated the collective farms. In this situation, collective farms themselves are now able to solve problems in collective farm life more independently than before, in accordance with the overall interests of the state, the public interests of the collective farm, and the individual interests of the collective farm members.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and The Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union consider it necessary to suggest and advise collective farms to supplement and revise individual clauses of the Agricultural Labor Cooperative Charter on their own, based on the main task of ensuring the rapid development of agriculture and animal husbandry, and taking into account the local and specific conditions of the collective farm.

When revising and supplementing the Agricultural Labor Cooperative Charter, attention should be paid to the following points:

Guarantee the most rational use of land, which is the main wealth of the collective farm, on the basis of the new agricultural planning methods, fully utilize the means of production and labor force of the collective farm and the machine tractor station, reduce non-productive expenditures of currency, in-kind, and labor, as well as administrative expenses. On this basis, greatly increase the labor productivity of members and increase the production of agricultural products, which is the main source of increasing the income of the collective farm's public economy and improving the material income of members.

Consider the participation of members of the member's family who have labor power in the labor of the collective farm's public economy to determine the amount of private plots. When determining the area of private plots, the principle should be based on the principle that those members of the member's family who have labor power but do not participate in farm work or participate in little work in the farm's public economy should be given less private plots than those members who work sincerely in the farm. At the same time, collective farm public land should not be used to increase private plots. On the contrary, the area of private plots should be reduced as much as possible, because under the conditions of machine tractor stations having a large amount of technical equipment and a high level of mechanization, the benefits obtained from using land for the public economy will be incomparably greater, and in the final analysis, the income of members will also be much greater.

According to local conditions, stipulate the number of livestock that collective farm members' families retain for private use, given that in many areas that were previously listed as developed animal husbandry agricultural areas by the Model Charter of the Agricultural Labor Cooperative and in the past semi-nomadic and nomadic areas, there have been significant changes in the direction of operation recently, and it may not be necessary to preserve the number of livestock previously stipulated to be owned by collective farm members' families.

According to the needs of labor expenditure in the collective farm's public economy, stipulate the minimum number of labor days that must be done, and formulate work quotas and methods of converting to labor days based on the level of mechanization and the actual workload achieved by diligent members, as well as the need to save labor day expenditures.

Comprehensively utilize the principle of collective farm members' material interests in developing collective farm public production, encourage the best working members of the collective farm, and implement monthly remuneration advances to collective farm members as an important stimulus to improving the labor productivity of the collective farm, and establish the necessary circulating in-kind funds and cash for this purpose.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union suggest that collective farms retain the personal private plots within the scope stipulated by the collective farm for tractor drivers and other workers in tractor teams who work permanently at the machine tractor station and live in the collective farm. If the able-bodied family members of machine tractor station tractor drivers and fixed staff members do not complete the minimum labor days stipulated by the collective farm, the area of their private plots can be reduced according to the decision of the collective farm members' meeting.

The Agricultural Labor Cooperative Charter passed by the collective farm members' meeting and filed with the district executive committee, as well as revised, changed, and supplemented, is the fundamental law of agricultural labor cooperative activities, and it is the obligation of all members of the collective farm to abide by this charter.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union believe that it is incorrect for the district executive committee to cancel the decisions of the collective farm members' meeting on expelling members, reducing the area of private plots, and some other issues without notifying the collective farm members. This gives lazy members an excuse not to consider the opinions and interests of the collective, which devalues the role of the collective farm members' meeting and reduces the collective farm members' sense of responsibility for the resolutions they have passed. Therefore, it is more reasonable for the district executive committee to refer the complaints of collective farm members on the expulsion of members, the reduction of the area of private plots, and other issues to the collective farm members' meeting for reconsideration, and the decision after reconsideration should be the final decision.

Given that in many collective farms, especially in suburban collective farms, some lazy members and individual people living in collective farm villages do not engage in social and production labor, that is, they consistently do not engage in work in collective farms, state enterprises and institutions, or cooperative societies and social organizations, but they are treated equally with those members who work sincerely. It would be correct for the collective farm itself to decide whether or not to allow these people to use private plots, pastures, and hayfields.

Given that it is difficult to convene a meeting of all members regularly in some large collective farms that include many residential points, it is best for the collective farm itself to determine the meeting system according to the situation, and determine where various problems in the life of the collective farm should be discussed and resolved, whether at a meeting of all members, at a meeting of plenipotentiary representatives and trustees elected by members, or at a work team meeting.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union call the attention of district committees, state committees, border region committees, the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of the Union Republics, district Soviet executive committees, state Soviet executive committees, border region Soviet executive committees, and the Councils of Ministers of autonomous republics and Union Republics to the fact that further promoting the initiative of collective farm members in organizing collective farm production and managing collective farm affairs does not reduce, but increases the sense of responsibility of Party organizations, Soviet organs, and agricultural organs for collective farm affairs. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union require that the level of political and organizational work in rural areas be raised, the creative initiative of collective farm members be increased, the role of all manpower and material resources in socialist agriculture be brought into play, and the sense of responsibility of our cadres for the affairs of each collective farm be raised.

On Monthly Advances to Collective Farm Members'
Remuneration and Supplementary Remuneration for Labor

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union pointed out that the cash income of collective farms has increased in recent years, and the cash remuneration for labor days of collective farm members has also increased. However, the current system of collective farms, that is, the basic part of the income that should be distributed according to labor days, is only issued to collective farm members at the end of the economic year, which is not enough to promote the growth of agricultural product production, nor does it conform to the task of further increasing the material interests of collective farm members in developing the public economy.

Many collective farms have adopted a more advanced system of distributing income, which is to pay collective farm members monthly remuneration for all labor days done for the public economy. In order to advance the remuneration of collective farm members, many collective farms have established circulating funds and grain reserves.

Monthly advances to collective farm members' remuneration are the most important stimulus to improving the labor productivity of collective farms, which can improve the role of labor days and increase the interest of collective farm members in developing the public economy.

The necessity of revising the current system of supplementary labor remuneration for collective farm members has matured. Now, when collective farms themselves are able to plan the development of their own economy according to the interests of the whole country and the entire collective farm, the current supplementary remuneration system, that is, paying remuneration for exceeding the plan in all farms in each state, border region, and republic according to the same standard, regardless of the level of production and the characteristics of each collective farm, limits the initiative of collective farms and cannot encourage the conscientious collective farm members who exceed the planned tasks in various departments.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union believe that at present, when the necessary conditions have been created for the rapid development of various departments of collective farms, when collective farms have been consolidated organizationally, and when sufficient experience has been accumulated for managing the collective economy, the previously proposed set of methods and standards for paying supplementary remuneration are not necessary. Due to the increase in agricultural product production and the increase in the income of collective farms and the inestimable increase in the basic labor remuneration of collective farm members, the supplementary remuneration should be an encouraging way to reward outstanding workers.

When implementing the new planning system, collective farms themselves can plan the production of collective farms considering the full utilization of all existing conditions, and stipulate the tasks of work teams (production groups) and collective farm members working in animal husbandry and other agricultural departments according to the adopted plan. In this situation, supplementary remuneration should be given to those collective farm members, experts, and machine tractor station work team workers who improve their knowledge level, show creative initiative, and promote all advanced and progressive work methods in collective farm production, thereby exceeding the planned tasks set by the collective farm, and produce more agricultural products with their excellent work.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union believe that the more correct approach is for the collective farm members' meeting to determine and approve the supplementary labor remuneration for collective farm members, work teams (groups), staff members of machine tractor station tractor teams, collective farm experts, and leaders for exceeding the planned output per unit area of crops and the output of animal husbandry. When determining the amount of supplementary remuneration to be given, it is necessary to consider the production level achieved by the work team (group) in field operations, animal husbandry, and other agricultural departments. Here, the principle of encouraging collective farm members working in various departments of collective farm production should be observed approximately equally.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union resolved:

In order to further increase the material interests of collective farm members in developing the public economy, it is recommended that collective farms advance the remuneration of collective farm members' labor days monthly each year according to the decision of the collective farm members' meeting, the amount of which is at least 25% of the actual cash in various departments of the public economy, and 50% of the cash prepaid according to purchase contracts, acquisitions, and requisitions.

The National Bank is instructed to credit 25% of the various incomes of the collective farm and 50% of the cash prepaid according to purchase contracts, acquisitions, and requisitions to a special current account according to the requirements of the collective farm. The collective farm management committee can only withdraw money from this account for the purpose of prepaying the remuneration of collective farm members and distributing the remuneration of labor days.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union instruct the Soviet Ministry of Procurement, the Soviet Ministry of Meat and Dairy Products Industry, the Soviet Ministry of Food Industry, and the Central Union of All-Soviet Consumer Cooperatives to prepay 50% of the cash from 1956 onwards according to the requirements of collective farm members, according to the amount of grain, sunflower and other oil crops, potatoes, vegetables, and meat that the state should requisition.

The Soviet National Bank should provide the procurement agencies with appropriate loans as prepayment funds.

The Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and the Soviet National Bank are instructed to formulate instructions on the system of prepaying cash to collective farms for the requisition of the above-mentioned products to collective farms with the participation of the relevant ministries and competent authorities, and to approve this instruction within one month.

The resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union stipulates that collective farms should first withdraw money from the total cash income to repay long-term loans used for investment, and the part of the money withdrawn from the total cash income to repay loans should be accounted for in the public accumulation fund.

It is recommended that collective farms, according to the resolution of the meeting of all members of the collective farm, account for the expenditure of labor day remuneration used in building livestock sheds, other houses and buildings, and planting and cultivating perennial trees in the public accumulation fund account in accordance with the approved budget of receipts and expenditures.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union recommend that collective farms stipulate the system and standards for paying supplementary in-kind and cash remuneration themselves, which is paid to work teams (work groups), collective farm members engaged in animal husbandry, staff members of machine tractor station tractor teams, experts, and leaders of collective farms who exceed the planned output per unit area of crops and the output of animal products formulated and approved by the collective farm based on the full utilization of all existing potential.

    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议
    关于集体农庄的决议
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议研究了关于农业劳动组合章程和进一步发挥集体农民在组织集体农庄生产和管理集体农庄事务中的主动精神的问题，以及关于每月预付给集体农民现金和集体农庄的补加劳动报酬的问题，并且就这两个问题通过了下列决议。
    关于农业劳动组合章程和进一步发挥
    集体农民在组织集体农庄生产和管理
    集体农庄事务中的主动精神
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议认为，尽力发展和巩固集体农庄的公有经济，在劳动生产率进一步提高、国家对集体农庄的组织和技术上的帮助日益增加和使集体农庄和集体农民根据当地的条件在组织和经营集体经济中发挥主动精神的基础上急速提高各个农业生产部门，是具有头等重要意义的事情。
    我们国家在共产党和苏联政府的领导下，在工业化的基础上实行了全盘集体化。在农村中建立了新的社会主义制度，这种制度根本改变了几千万农民的生产和生活的基础。
    在我国，大的集体农业生产已经代替分散的和原始的农民经济，这种生产有可能广泛地运用新的技术、利用先进科学的一切成就和出产更多商品产品。集体农庄制度创造了新的社会主义劳动组织和更高的劳动生产率，为苏联农村的全体劳动者打开了一条走向富裕生活的广阔的道路。共产党和苏维埃国家在组织集体农庄的时候一向认为，只有在男女集体农民具有真正的主动精神并且积极参加劳动组合的经营管理的基础上才有可能达到最高的劳动生产率，进一步在集体农庄中巩固新的社会纪律。
    集体农庄庄员第二次代表大会所通过的农业劳动组合示范章程对巩固集体农庄制度有着巨大的意义，这个章程归纳了这一时期在实行集体经营方面所积累的经验。这个章程通过以来，已经有20多年了。在这个时期中，集体农庄的农村生活发生了巨大的变化，在建设多部门的公有经济方面积累了新的、丰富的经验。集体农民的政治觉悟提高了，他们对全民利益的理解加深了，在工人阶级起领导作用下的工人阶级和农民的联盟更加巩固了。集体农庄生产的新的物质技术基础建立起来了。
    现在，集体农庄的全部田间工作差不多已经完全机械化，畜牧业和集体农庄其他生产部门工作的机械化在不断提高。集体农庄和机器拖拉机站——现在是提高集体农庄公有经济的决定力量——的相互关系扩大和巩固了。国内进行了集体农庄合并的工作。由于补充了领导干部和专家干部，机器拖拉机站和集体农庄加强了。现在，机器拖拉机站和集体农庄的领导人一般都是有经验的工作人员，他们有能力实际解决组织庞大的多部门经济方面的问题。国家正在实行重大的措施来提高集体农庄和集体农庄庄员在发展农业生产中的物质利益。在农业计划方面实行了新的制度，集体农庄得以在执行国家规定的商品产量任务的基础上，自己根据当地条件计划整个公有经济的发展，以便在每百公顷的农业用地上，对单位产品花费最少的劳动和资金而获得最大数量的农产品。
    现在集体农庄建设已上升到自己的发展过程中的新阶段，集体农庄必须要去解决进一步提高农业生产方面的新任务，在这种情况下，农业劳动组合示范章程已经不能包括集体农庄多种多样的生活和活动的一切方面，往往还限制了集体农庄的主动性，限制了它们在建立最符合集体农庄工作具体条件的、经营公有经济的新制度方面的主动性。
    在集体农庄和集体农庄庄员写给苏共中央和苏联部长会议的许多封信里，都提出了建议，要求修改农业劳动组合示范章程中某些条文，特别是提出了关于宅旁园地的分配规则和规模，属于集体农户个人私有的牲畜数量，使用集体农庄的牧场的规则，确定劳动日的最低限度，把集体农庄庄员开除出集体农庄，分配收入，扩大集体农庄管理委员会的权力等等问题的建议。集体农庄庄员们正确地指出，农业劳动组合示范章程对分给集体农户宅旁园地的规定是同在组织上和经济上巩固集体农庄这一任务相矛盾的，因为，这个规定不问集体农庄中有劳动力的成员在劳动上参加公有经济的程度如何。常常有一些劳动日很少的懒惰农民，有时甚至有一些事实上同集体农庄已经断绝了一切劳动联系的人们却拥有大片的宅旁园地，使用着集体农庄的牧场，享受规定是给予集体农庄庄员的其它一些优待，可是他们并不履行集体农庄庄员的基本义务。
    结果就造成这样的情形，对集体经济经营的后果以及对履行集体农庄向国家承担的义务的一切责任都落在那些勤勤恳恳工作的庄员身上，而那些不参加农庄公有经济的劳动的懒惰的庄员却享有集体农庄庄员的一切优待，发展他们私人的经济而损害公有经济，也就是损害所有集体农庄庄员的共同利益。
    集体农庄建设的全部经验令人信服地说明，只有努力发展集体农庄的公有生产，才能够最充分地满足集体农庄庄员们的个人需要。庄员私人的宅旁园地应该是补助性质的，在集体农庄的公有经济还没有充分地发展到既能充分满足集体农庄的公共需要，又能满足庄员的个人要求以前，这种宅旁园地是必要的。每个集体农庄都应该做到使公有经济不断发展。生产更多的各种农产品，在这个基础上日益充分地满足国家、集体农庄和集体农庄庄员对这些产品的需求。我们已经有不少集体农庄的农产品生产达到了这种水平，以致庄员们按劳动日从公有经济所得的实物收入和现金收入已经增长到使庄员不必关心需要有章程所规定的一定的私人补助经济了。
    因此，必需努力使公有经济在一切集体农庄庄员收入方面所起的作用不断地增加，庄员的一切需要基本上靠公有经济得到满足，参加集体农庄生产而获得的收入应当成为庄员总收入中的主要部分，而庄员宅旁园地和从它所获得的收入实际上只能起补助的作用，这主要是满足庄员对新鲜蔬菜、水果、浆果等的私人需要，因此这些宅旁园地只能开辟为花园和浆果园，作为集体农庄庄员生活上的装饰。
    很多集体农庄庄员来信要求让集体农庄自己有权决定集体农庄庄员宅旁园地的数量，以及解决其他集体农庄内部的问题，以利于公有经济迅速高涨和增进集体农庄庄员物质福利。
    苏共中央和苏联部长会议指出，在许多地区，地方的党、苏维埃和农业机关有破坏集体农庄民主的事实，他们强迫集体农庄接受不符合生产的具体条件和农庄发展水平的一般的组织形式和经济标准。有时候集体农庄内部生活的许多问题，例如生产队和生产小组的组织、集体农庄庄员的劳动定额和报酬、生产队长和集体农庄其他任职人员的任命等都由上面规定下来，而这样一些事情是必需非常仔细地考虑到每一个农庄的条件才能作出决定的。他们并不是老练地帮助集体农庄庄员依据每一个农庄的具体条件正确地组织劳动，而是强迫集体农庄接受一成不变的工作定额和计工法，划一的标准和管理机构的组织制度等等，尽管各个集体农庄的工作条件有着极大的差别。
    许多工作人员忘记了，农业劳动组合是农民自愿结合的集体经济，劳动组合的成员自己管理劳动组合的产品和财产，按照苏维埃政权的法律、党和政府的决议以及根据国家、集体农庄和集体农庄庄员的利益进行工作。由于忘记这一点，这些工作人员就不是及时地提示和建议集体农庄应该怎样正确地组织和管理经济，而是不深刻地研究集体农庄中的情况，不注意各个个别农庄的特点和很少具体地帮助集体农庄。
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议决定：
    估计到自从通过农业劳动组合示范章程以来，在集体农庄村庄中发生了下列一些重大的变化：建立了新的物质技术基础，积累了组织和管理集体经济的丰富经验，集体农民的政治觉悟提高了，城市派遣的3万名有经验的干部和从集体农民中成长起来的能够管理大规模的多部门经济和在实践中能正确解决管理集体经济问题的有经验的干部巩固了集体农庄。在这种情况下，集体农庄自己已经能够比从前更为独立地、按照国家的全民利益、集体农庄的公共利益和集体农庄庄员的个人利益来解决集体农庄生活中的问题。
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议认为有必要建议和劝告集体农庄，要它们根据保证迅速发展农业和畜牧业这一主要任务，在考虑到集体农庄的当地的和具体的条件的情况下，自行补充和修改农业劳动组合章程的个别条款。
    在修改和补充农业劳动组合章程的时候，应该注意下列各点：
    保证在新的农业计划方法的基础上，最合理地利用作为集体农庄主要财富的土地，充分利用集体农庄和机器拖拉机站的生产资料和劳动力，减少非生产的货币、实物和劳动的消耗以及行政开支。在这个基础上大大地提高庄员的劳动生产率和增加农产品的生产，这是提高集体农庄公有经济的收入和改善庄员物质收入的主要源泉。
    考虑庄员家庭中有劳动力的成员参加集体农庄公有经济劳动的情况来决定宅旁园地的多少。在确定宅旁园地面积的时候，应当依据这样的原则：对于那些庄员家庭中有劳动力而不参加农庄工作或者参加农庄公有经济工作不多的人，分给的宅旁园地就要少于那些在农庄里诚心诚意工作的庄员。同时不应当用集体农庄公有土地来增加宅旁园地，相反地应尽量减少宅旁园地的面积，因为在机器拖拉机站有大量技术设备和高度机械化水平的条件下，将土地利用于公有经济所得到的利益将多得无可比拟，归根到底，庄员的收入也会多得多。
    根据当地条件来规定集体农庄庄员家庭留归私人使用的牲畜的数量，鉴于在许多过去被农业劳动组合示范章程列为发达的畜牧业农业地区和在过去的半游牧区和游牧区中，最近以来经营方向已有重大改变，未必有必要保存从前所规定的集体农庄庄员家庭所有的牲畜的数目。
    根据集体农庄公有经济的劳动开支的需要来规定必须做的劳动日的最低限度，并且根据机械化的水平和勤恳劳动的庄员所达到的实际工作量以及节省劳动日开支的必要性，来制定工作定额和折算为劳动日的办法。
    全面利用集体农庄庄员对发展集体农庄公有生产的物质利益的原则，鼓励集体农庄最优秀的工作成员，实行作为对提高集体农庄劳动生产率的重要刺激因素的对集体农庄庄员每月的报酬预付和为了这个目的而建立必要的流动实物基金和现金。
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议建议集体农庄保留在机器拖拉机站固定工作的和在集体农庄中生活的拖拉机手和拖拉机工作队的其他工人在集体农庄所规定范围之内的个人宅旁园地。如果机器拖拉机站拖拉机手和固定的工作人员的具有劳动能力的家属没有完成集体农庄所规定的最低劳动日，那么根据集体农庄庄员大会的决定，可以减少他们宅旁园地的面积。
    集体农庄庄员大会所通过的并且在区执行委员会备案的以及经过修正、更改和补充的农业劳动组合章程，是农业劳动组合活动的根本法，遵守这个章程是集体农庄全体庄员的义务。
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议认为，区执行委员会在没有通知集体农庄庄员的情况下而取消集体农庄庄员大会关于开除庄员、减少宅旁园地面积和一些其他问题的决定是不正确的。这样就使懒惰的庄员有不考虑集体的意见和利益的借口，这样就会贬低集体农庄庄员大会的作用和降低集体农庄庄员对他们所通过的决议的责任感。因此，区执行委员会所接到的集体农庄庄员对开除庄员、减少宅旁园地的面积和对其他问题的控诉，再交由集体农庄庄员大会重新考虑，在考虑之后的决议作为最后的决定，这样做是比较合理的。
    鉴于在许多集体农庄中、特别是在城郊的集体农庄中，有些懒惰的庄员和住在集体农庄村庄上的个别人，不从事社会和生产劳动，也就是一贯地不在集体农庄、国家企业和机关或是合作社和社会组织中从事工作，但是他们却同那些诚恳工作的庄员一样，受到同等的对待。对这一类人是否能让他们使用宅旁园地、牧场和割草场，这由集体农庄自己作出决定，将是正确的。
    鉴于一些包括有好多个居民点的大集体农庄中很难定期召开全体庄员大会，最好是由集体农庄本身根据情况来确定开会制度，确定集体农庄生活中的种种问题应当在哪里讨论和解决，是在全体庄员大会上、是在庄员选出的全权代表和受委托的人的会议上，还是在工作队会议上。
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议提请区委员会、州委员会、边疆区委员会、加盟共和国共产党中央委员会，区苏维埃执行委员会、州苏维埃执行委员会、边疆区苏维埃执行委员会、自治共和国和加盟共和国部长会议注意：进一步发挥集体农庄庄员在组织集体农庄生产和管理集体农庄事务上的主动精神并不是减少了，而是增加了党组织、苏维埃机关和农业机关对集体农庄事务所负的责任心。苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议要求提高农村中的政治和组织工作的水平、提高集体农庄庄员的创造积极性、发挥社会主义农业中的一切人力和物力的作用，提高我们干部对每一个集体农庄的事务的责任心。
  关于集体农庄每月预付集体农庄
    庄员的报酬和劳动的补加报酬
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议指出，最近几年来集体农庄的现金收入增加了，对集体农庄庄员劳动日的现金报酬也增加了。可是，集体农庄现行的制度，即应当按照劳动日进行分配的收入的基本部分，只是在经济年度结束的时候才发给集体农庄庄员，这既不足以促进农产品生产的增长，又不符合进一步提高集体农庄庄员在发展公有经济中的物质利益的任务。
    许多集体农庄采用了比较先进的分配收入的制度，这种制度是按月预付集体农庄庄员为公有经济所做的全部劳动日的报酬。为了预付集体农庄庄员的报酬，许多集体农庄建立了流动基金和粮食储备。
    按月预付集体农庄庄员的报酬是提高集体农庄劳动生产率的最重要的刺激因素，它可以提高劳动日的作用，提高集体农庄庄员对发展公有经济的兴趣。
    重新修订对集体农庄庄员补加劳动报酬的现行制度的必要性，已经成熟了。现在，当集体农庄本身已经能够根据全国和整个集体农庄利益来计划自己经济发展的时候，现行的补加报酬制度，即不顾生产水平和每一个集体农庄的特点，在各个州、边疆区和共和国的一切农庄中，按照同一的标准，付给超额完成计划的报酬的制度，限制了集体农庄的主动性，并且不能鼓励在各个部门中超额完成计划任务的诚诚恳恳工作的集体农庄庄员。
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议认为，在目前，当已经为集体农庄各部门的迅速发展创造了必要的条件，当集体农庄在组织上巩固了，并且为管理集体经济积累了足够的经验的时候，以前所提出的一套支付补加报酬的制度和标准的办法就没有必要了。由于农产品生产的提高和集体农庄收入的提高和集体农庄庄员的基本劳动报酬不可估量的增加，因此，补加的报酬应当是奖励优秀工作者的一种鼓励方式。
    在实行新计划制度的时候，集体农庄自己可以考虑到充分利用一切现有的条件来计划集体农庄的生产，根据通过的计划来规定在畜牧业和其他农业部门工作的工作队（生产小组）和集体农庄庄员的任务，在这种情况下，补加报酬应当给这样一些集体农庄庄员、专家和机器拖拉机站工作队的工人，这些人提高自己的知识水平，表现创造性的主动精神，并且在集体农庄生产中推广一切先进和进步的工作方法，从而超额完成集体农庄所订的计划任务，以及用自己的优异工作生产更多的农产品。
    苏共中央和苏联部长会议认为比较正确的做法是集体农庄庄员、工作队（小组）、机器拖拉机站拖拉机工作队工作人员、集体农庄专家和领导人员因超额完成农作物单位面积产量和畜牧业产量计划而补加的劳动报酬由集体农庄庄员大会确定和批准。在确定给予补加报酬数量时，必须考虑到工作队（小组）在田间作业、畜牧业和其他农业部门中所达到的生产水平，这里应该大约在同等程度上遵守鼓励在集体农庄生产各部门中工作的集体农庄庄员的原则。
    苏共中央和苏联部长会议决议：
    为了进一步提高集体农庄庄员在发展公有经济中的物质利益，建议集体农庄根据集体农庄庄员大会的决定每年按月预付集体农庄庄员的劳动日报酬，其数量至少为公有经济各部门的实际现金的25％，以及根据定购合同、收购和征购而预收的现金的50％。
    责成国家银行根据集体农庄的要求将集体农庄各种收入的25％和根据定购合同、收购和征购而预收的现金的50％记入特别的往来帐上，集体农庄管理委员会只能从这个帐目上把钱取来用于预付集体农庄庄员的报酬和分配劳动日的报酬。
    苏共中央和苏联部长会议责成苏联采购部、苏联肉乳制品工业部、苏联食品工业部和全苏消费合作社中央联合会从1956年开始按照集体农庄庄员的要求、按照国家应当征购的粮食、向日葵和其他油料作物、马铃薯、蔬菜和肉类的数量预付50％的现金。
    苏联国家银行应当贷给采购机构适当的贷款作为预付的用款。
    责成苏联农业部和苏联国家银行在有关的部和主管机关的参加下制定关于为向集体农庄征购上述产品而预付给集体农庄现款的制度的指示，并且要在一个月期内批准这个指令。
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议的决议规定，集体农庄首先从总的现金收入中抽出钱来偿还用作投资的长期贷款，而从总现金收入中抽出来偿付贷款的这部分钱算在公积金帐内。
    建议集体农庄根据集体农庄全体庄员大会的决议，在符合已经批准的收支预算的情况下把用在建筑畜舍、其他的房屋和建筑物以及栽种和培育多年生树木这些方面的劳动日报酬的开支算在公积金账上。
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议建议集体农庄自行规定支付补加实物和现金报酬的制度和标准，这种报酬付给超额完成集体农庄根据充分利用一切现有的潜力所制定的和批准的农作物单位面积产量和畜产品产量计划的工作队（工作组）、从事畜牧工作的集体农庄庄员、机器拖拉机站拖拉机工作队的工作人员、专家和集体农庄的领导人员。
