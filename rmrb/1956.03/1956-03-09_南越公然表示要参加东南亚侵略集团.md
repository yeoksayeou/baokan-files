    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 8th: Ngo Dinh Diem's Foreign Minister, Vu Van Mau, openly opposed the provisions of the Geneva Accords, saying that South Vietnam hopes to participate in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization as an active partner. According to an Associated Press report, Vu Van Mau made these remarks at a press conference in Saigon on March 7.

    Vu Van Mau refused to answer the question of whether South Vietnam had already requested to be accepted as a member or whether it would formally submit this request after US Secretary of State Dulles visits Saigon next week. He said, "This is a diplomatic secret."

    Vu Van Mau's remarks indicate that the South Vietnamese authorities, under the instigation of the United States, are preparing to further undermine the Geneva Armistice Agreements after holding unilateral elections, directly participate in the Manila Treaty Organization, this military aggression bloc, and incorporate South Vietnam into the US base network. This is bound to create a new dangerous situation in Indochina. The aforementioned actions of the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities have received open encouragement. For example, according to a United Press International report from Karachi, one of the "top representatives" attending the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council meeting said on March 5 that "South Vietnam would be welcome to join the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization if it applies for membership."

    南越公然表示要参加东南亚侵略集团
    新华社河内8日电　吴庭艳的外交部长武文牡，公然反对日内瓦协定的规定说，南越希望作为一个积极的伙伴参加东南亚条约组织。据美联社的消息说，武文牡是
  3月7日在西贡的一个记者招待会上说这番话的。
    武文牡拒绝回答这样的问题，即南越是否已经要求被接受加入，还是就在下星期美国国务卿杜勒斯到西贡访问之后再正式提出这项请求。他说“这是一个外交秘密”。
    武文牡谈话表明，受美国指使的南越当局在举行了片面选举以后，正在准备进一步破坏日内瓦停战协定，直接参加马尼拉条约组织这个军事侵略集团，把南越纳入美国的基地网，这势必会在印度支那造成新的危险局势。吴庭艳当局的上述行动得到公开的鼓励。例如，据合众社从喀喇蚩报道，有一位参加东南亚条约组织理事会会议的“最高代表之一”在3月5日说，“南越将被欢迎加入东南亚条约组织，如果它申请成员国身份的话。”
