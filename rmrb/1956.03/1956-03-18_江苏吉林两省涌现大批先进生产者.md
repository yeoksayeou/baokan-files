A large number of advanced producers emerge in Jiangsu and Jilin provinces

    In Jiangsu Province, industrial and mining enterprises are actively carrying out the advanced producer movement, and the ranks of advanced producers are constantly expanding. At present, there are 21,128 advanced producers in factories across the province.
    Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory has selected 218 advanced producers and 48 advanced groups this year, including Zhuang Minggeng, Chen Haigen and others who have completed five years of work ahead of schedule. Under the influence of advanced producers, workers at Nanjing Machine Tool Factory have generally exceeded the new quotas set in January this year.

    More than 300,000 employees in industrial and mining enterprises in Jilin Province have participated in the socialist competition. According to statistics in early March, more than 23,000 rationalization proposals have been put forward in 40 factories and mines. More than 9,000 employees in more than 30 units in Changchun, Jilin and other places have exceeded this year's new quotas. Bian Zhen, a fitter at Changchun Railway Vehicle Depot, took the initiative to propose revisions to 12 types of quotas, and motivated other employees to propose quota revisions. In 121 units, more than 8,000 advanced producers and more than 840 advanced collectives have emerged. Driven by these advanced figures, state-owned industrial and mining enterprises across the province have overfulfilled their output value plans for January and February.
