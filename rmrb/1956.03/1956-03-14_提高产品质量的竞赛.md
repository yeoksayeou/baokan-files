A socialist competition focusing on improving product quality is gradually deepening in various state-owned cotton textile factories in Qingdao. In the past month, it has reversed the downward trend in the quality of cotton yarn and cotton cloth that occurred in January. In February, the cotton yarn produced by the eight cotton textile factories under the Qingdao Textile Management Bureau, with the exception of individual yarn counts from a few factories that did not meet the quality plan, the vast majority of factories met the national quality standards for each count. The quality of various yarn counts at the No. 6 State-owned Cotton Factory met the national standards daily; 32-count yarn also achieved first-class superior yarn and first-class grade one yarn, and the overall product quality improved by 4.5% compared to the national standards.

At the beginning of the competition, some factories and workshops conducted detailed investigations around the key issues affecting product quality, and put forward different specific requirements for different types of work. For example, the weaving branch of the No. 8 State-owned Cotton Factory focused on the most significant problems affecting the appearance defects of cotton cloth, emphasizing reducing weft breaks, thin weft, skipped stitches, and eliminating oil stains, flying lint, and hairy yarn as directions for improving product quality, which was very popular among the masses.

During the competition, workers enthusiastically put forward various militant slogans such as "One Hundred Days Without Defective Cloth," "One Hundred Machines Without Thread Breaks," and "No Missed Inspection Week" among different types of work, and their enthusiasm for learning from advanced units and advanced producers was unprecedentedly high. After the No. 3 State-owned Cotton Factory heard about the new experience of "One Hundred Machines Without Thread Breaks" at the No. 6 State-owned Cotton Factory, they immediately organized workshop technicians to visit and learn from them. After the thread-winding workers in the cone-winding workshop of the No. 5 State-owned Cotton Factory heard that Xin Xiumei, a thread-winding worker in Team C and a representative of advanced producers in Qingdao, had created a new record for fewer oily yarns (the administrative target was no more than 3.257 oily yarns per person per day, while Xin Xiumei only produced 0.7), they all proactively gathered around her machine to patiently observe her operating methods.

Engineering and technical personnel from various factories also actively participated in the competition to improve product quality. The technical personnel of the No. 6 State-owned Cotton Factory, based on the eight key quality-related issues currently existing in the factory, such as excessive impurities in cotton laps and uneven yarn counts, established eight research groups respectively and specifically formulated plans for carrying out the work. In the preparation workshop of the No. 3 State-owned Cotton Factory, technical assistant Zhang Ronglin proactively approached veteran machine repair worker Jiang Zhengbao to jointly study the phenomenon of long and short yardage defective cloth caused by inaccurate markings on the warping machine. As a result, they came up with a solution: installing a "thousand-yard stop" device on the warping machine, completely eliminating this type of problem.

    提高产品质量的竞赛
    一个以提高产品质量为重点的社会主义竞赛，正在青岛市各国营棉纺织厂中逐步深入开展起来。一个月来，已经扭转了棉纱、棉布质量在1月份下降的趋势。2月份，青岛纺管局所属8个棉纺织厂的棉纱，除个别厂的个别纱支没完成质量计划外，绝大部分厂都按支数达到了国家质量标准。国棉六厂各种纱支的质量，做到按日完成国家指标；32支纱还出现了一等优级纱和上等一级纱，全部产品质量比国家指标提高了4.5％。
    竞赛一开始，有的厂和车间就围绕产品质量的关键问题进行细致的调查，分别不同工种提出了不同的具体要求。例如国棉八厂织布分厂紧紧抓住影响棉布外观疵点最主要的毛病，重点提出了减少脱纬、稀纬、跳花和消灭油污、飞花、毛纱等改进产品质量的方向，很受群众欢迎。
    在竞赛中，工人们在不同工种间响亮地提出了“百日无次布”、“百台不断头”、“不漏验周”等各种战斗口号，向先进单位、先进生产者学习的积极性空前高涨。国棉三厂听到国棉六厂出现“百台不断头”的新经验以后，立即组织车间技术工人登门学习。国棉五厂筒摇成车间的拈线工人，听到丙班拈线工、青岛市先进生产者代表辛秀美又创造了少出油纱的新纪录（行政指标每人每天出的油纱不超过3.257个，辛秀美只出0.7个）以后，都主动围在她的车头上，耐心地观摩她的操作方法。
    各厂工程技术人员也积极投入了提高产品质量的竞赛。国棉六厂的技术人员，根据厂内当前存在的棉卷杂质多、纱支不均匀等8个有关质量的关键问题，分别成立了8个研究小组，并且具体拟定出进行工作的计划。国棉三厂准备车间，因为整经机标记不准确而造成长、短码次布的现象，技术助理员张荣麟主动找老修机工人姜正宝共同研究，结果想出了解决办法：在整经车上装上“千码停车”的装置，完全根绝了这类毛病。
