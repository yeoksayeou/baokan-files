The Lin Ruiting Carpentry Team of the Second Engineering Company of the Sichuan Provincial Urban Construction Bureau has, in the past six months, helped 8 brother teams with a total of 104 people reach an advanced level.

Every time the Lin Ruiting team is transferred to a new construction site, they inquire about the work situation and problems of other carpentry teams, and then invite the trade union to host experience exchange meetings to explain and demonstrate various advanced tools and methods. The Lin Ruiting team also twice jointly organized joint teams with other carpentry teams, using and manufacturing advanced tools together with workers from other teams, enabling them to quickly master advanced tools and advanced experience. Before participating in the joint team, the Zhuo Bingliang team could only make 70 window sashes a day with 4 people; after participating in the joint team, 3 people could make 120 window sashes a day.

The Lin Ruiting team also adopted the method of exchanging workers for study to drive other teams to reach an advanced level. For example, after the Lin Ruiting team and the Lin Degui team each sent 3 people to exchange workers for study, the Lin Degui team's sample-making work improved from not meeting the quota to exceeding the quota by 75%. The Lin Ruiting Carpentry Team also sent advanced tools and blueprints to carpentry teams as far away as Ya'an.

Last year, the Lin Ruiting team promoted 37 kinds of advanced tools and advanced experience, and this year the average quota exceeded 70% or more. In January of this year, the team proposed to guarantee that they would complete two years' worth of work within this year. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    林瑞廷木工组帮兄弟组达到先进水平
    四川省城市建设局第二工程公司林瑞廷木工小组，半年来帮助8个兄弟小组共104人达到了先进水平。
    林瑞廷小组每逢调到一个新工地，便去了解其他木工组的工作情况和问题，然后请工会主持召开经验交流会，讲解、表演各种先进工具和先进方法。林瑞廷小组还两次和其他木工小组共同组织联合队，和其他小组的工人共同使用和制造先进工具，使他们很快地掌握了先进工具和先进经验。卓炳良小组在参加联合队以前，4个人一天只能做70个窗扇；参加联合队以后，3个人一天便做120个窗扇。
    林瑞廷小组还采取换工留学的办法来带动其他小组达到先进的水平。例如林瑞廷小组和林德贵小组各派3人换工留学以后，林德贵小组的制样工作，由原来达不到定额提高到突破定额75％。林瑞廷木工小组还为远在雅安的木工组寄去先进工具和蓝图。
    林瑞廷小组去年推广了37种先进工具和先进经验，今年平均突破定额70％以上。今年1月份，这个小组又提出保证要在今年内完成两年的工作量。（据新华社讯）
