Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, March 28th: According to a report in the Sydney "Tribune" weekly on March 21st, Cyril Chambers, former Minister for the Army in the Labor government, recently delivered a speech in the House of Representatives advocating for the recognition of China. Chambers said that the People's Republic of China has 600 million people. Can we really say that not recognizing its government means that it is not the Chinese government?

Chambers, while solemnly warning against atomic war, recounted the horrors he witnessed in Hiroshima in 1946. Chambers said, "If I could take everyone in the world to see what happened in Hiroshima, then a third world war would never happen."

In his speech, he also pointed out that Australia's sending troops to Malaya was a mistake.

Webb, the Labor Member of Parliament for Stirling in Western Australia, praised the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. He believes that these principles should be the guiding principles for all countries. He said: "These principles are very good principles. If countries adopt these principles, there will be no danger of war."

    澳工党人士要求承认中国并赞成和平共处五项原则
    新华社28日讯　悉尼消息：据三月二十一日的悉尼“论坛”周报报道，前工党政府的陆军部长西里尔·钱伯斯最近在众议院发表演说，主张承认中国。钱伯斯说，中华人民共和国有六亿人民。难道我们能够说不承认它的政府就是中国政府吗？
    钱伯斯在郑重警告不要进行原子战争的时候，追述了他在1946年在广岛看到的惨象。钱伯斯说：“如果我能带全世界的人去看看在广岛发生了什么事情，那么第三次世界大战就永远不会发生”。
    他在发言中还指出澳大利亚派军队到马来亚去是犯了一个错误。
    澳大利亚西部斯特林的工党议员韦伯称赞和平共处的五项原则。他认为这些原则应当成为各国的指导原则。他说：“这些原则是非常好的原则。如果各国采取了这些原则，就不会有战争的危险。”
