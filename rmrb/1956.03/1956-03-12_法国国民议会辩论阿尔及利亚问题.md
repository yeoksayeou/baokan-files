Xinhua News Agency, Paris: The French National Assembly debated the issue of the Algerian situation on March 8th and 9th, regarding the Mollet government's request for special powers to handle the matter.

The two days of debate revealed that there are many supporters of the colonial groups within the French parliament who advocate for harsh military measures to suppress the Algerian national liberation movement. Members of parliament holding this view demanded "more decisive measures" be taken in Algeria, and called for the suppression of the French Communist Party and democratic newspapers.

The French Governor-General of Algeria, Lacoste, delivered a lengthy speech at the evening session on March 8th. He emphasized that the situation in Algeria was becoming increasingly complex, and the riots had spread to vast areas. The "rebel" elements had established their own regimes and enacted their own laws in the territories they occupied. Lacoste also pointed out that certain allies of France were carrying out conspiracies against France in Algeria. Lacoste believed that it was necessary to "restore security" and simultaneously implement reform measures in Algeria. Lacoste favored confiscating some of the large colonial estates in Algeria and distributing them to Algerian farmers.

Mollet spoke at the meeting on March 9th, requesting that the parliament grant the government full powers to deal with the Algerian issue. He said, "Only if we do not adopt a conservative attitude can we retain Algeria." Mollet expressed his intention to defend the interests of the French in Algeria, while also saying that French large property owners must relinquish a portion of their interests.

Mollet called on the local Algerian armed forces to cease fighting, saying that if his call was accepted, elections could be held and a constitution drafted in Algeria. At the same time, he also said that France would not abandon its interests in Algeria and that France would send more troops to Algeria.

Mollet raised the issue of a vote of confidence in the government on the issues debated at the meeting on March 9th. Mollet's motion brought the National Assembly's debate on the Algerian issue to a close. The debate on the vote of confidence will be held on March 11th.

    法国国民议会辩论阿尔及利亚问题
    据新华社讯　巴黎消息：法国国民议会在3月8日和9日就摩勒政府要求议会给予特别权力以处理阿尔及利亚局势问题进行了辩论。
    两天辩论的情况表明，在法国议会中有殖民集团的许多支持者，他们主张以严厉的军事措施来镇压阿尔及利亚的民族解放运动。抱这种观点的议员们要求在阿尔及利亚采取“更果断的措施”，并且对法国共产党和民主报纸进行镇压。
    法国驻阿尔及利亚总督拉戈斯特在3月8日晚间会议上发表了长篇演说。他强调说，阿尔及利亚的局势变得越来越复杂了，暴动已经蔓延到广大的地区。“反叛”分子在他们占据的领土上已经建立了他们自己的政权并且制定了他们自己的法律。拉戈斯特还指出，法国的某些盟国正在阿尔及利亚进行反对法国的阴谋活动。拉戈斯特认为必须“恢复安全”，并且同时在阿尔及利亚实行改革措施。拉戈斯特赞成在阿尔及利亚没收某些大的殖民地产，把它们分给阿尔及利亚农民。
    摩勒在3月9日的会议上发言，要求议会授予政府处理阿尔及利亚问题的充分权力。他说，“只有我们不采取保守态度，我们才能保住阿尔及利亚。”摩勒表示要保卫法国人在阿尔及利亚的利益，同时，他说法国大财产所有者必须放弃他们一部分利益。
    摩勒呼吁阿尔及利亚当地的人民武装停止战斗，他说，如果他的呼吁被接受，在阿尔及利亚就可以举行选举和草拟宪法。同时，他又说，法国不会放弃在阿尔及利亚的利益，法国将增派军队到阿尔及利亚去。
    摩勒在3月9日的会议上提出了就辩论中的问题对政府进行信任投票的问题。摩勒的动议使国民议会结束了对阿尔及利亚问题的辩论。讨论信任投票问题的辩论将在3月11日举行。
