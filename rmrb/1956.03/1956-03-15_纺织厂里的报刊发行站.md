    Newspaper and Magazine Distribution Station in a Textile Factory
    In the past, the subscription situation for newspapers and magazines in the Liaoyang Textile Factory was very abnormal. In one workshop, an average of one newspaper or magazine was subscribed for every three people. In two workshops, no one subscribed to any newspapers or magazines. In another workshop, an average of one newspaper was subscribed for every 100 people. The phenomenon of newspaper and magazine backlogs was also very serious.
    Recently, under the guidance of the Liaoyang Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, the Liaoyang Textile Factory established a newspaper and magazine distribution station, with the head of the Youth League's Propaganda Department concurrently serving as the stationmaster. In addition, a chief distributor was selected, and 54 employees were selected from various workshops and departments to serve as distributors.
    After the establishment of the station, the first task was to break the seasonal and monthly collection and subscription for the first quarter of newspapers and magazines. Within three days, the number of newspaper subscriptions in the factory increased from 849 to 1,493. The phenomenon of no one being responsible for newspaper and magazine distribution, as well as loss and backlogs, also disappeared.
    In order to meet the needs of employees in learning politics, culture, and technology, factories and mines in various places can learn from the experience of the Soviet Union in establishing factory and mine newspaper and magazine distribution stations, like the Liaoyang Textile Factory, and rely on the masses to do a good job in newspaper and magazine distribution.

    纺织厂里的报刊发行站
    过去，辽阳纺织厂订阅报刊的情况很不正常，有一个车间平均3个人订一份报刊，有两个车间一个订报的人也没有，另一个车间平均100人才订一份。报刊积压现象也很严重。
    最近，辽阳纺织厂在辽阳邮电局指导下，建立了报刊发行站，由青年团宣传部长兼任站长，另外选择一名总发行员，又从各车间、科室选择了54名职工当发行员。
    建站以后，第一项工作就是破季、破月收订第一季度报刊，3天之内，全厂订报份数由849份提高到了1，493份；报刊发行工作中无人负责和丢失、积压现象也没有了。
    为了满足职工学习政治、文化和技术的需要，各地厂矿可以像辽阳纺织厂这样，学习苏联建立厂矿报刊发行站的经验，依靠群众做好报刊发行工作。
