Xinhua News Agency, Rome, March 27th -- According to TASS, Rome, March 26th: Italian Communist Party members who serve as mayors, chairmen and members of provincial councils, and members of municipal councils held a meeting in Bologna. The purpose of this meeting was to summarize the work of the Communist Party members working in local autonomous organs and to determine the tasks in the upcoming elections of city and provincial councils in May.

Italian Communist Party leader Tracini gave a report at the meeting. He pointed out that at present, Communists, together with Socialists and other democratic groups, lead the autonomous organs of 2,200 towns (the total number of towns in Italy is 8,000) and 23 provinces (out of a total of 79). Thirty-five thousand Communist Party members are members of city and provincial councils, and they stand at these posts to wage a resolute struggle to raise the living standards of the broad masses of the people. In this election, the Communist Party has put forward 66,000 outstanding party members as candidates, and their future task will be to fight for the democratization of local autonomous organs.

Xinhua News Agency, Rome -- According to TASS, the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Youth League held a plenary meeting on March 24. Perali, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Youth League, gave a report on the topic: "The tasks of young communists in the upcoming election campaign."

In his report, Perali emphasized that Italian young communists should strive to attract an increasingly broad mass of the people to the side of the democratic movement. He pointed out that a broad front uniting young men and women with different political views would effectively strive to solve the extremely important problems of Italian youth: the democratization of the school system, the reduction of youth unemployment, the guarantee of Italy's national independence, and the solution of the disarmament issue.

Bai Yeta, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Italian Communist Party, pointed out in his speech that the two basic tasks of the Italian democratic movement in the upcoming elections are: First, to strive to win a majority in local political organs; Second, to launch a broad political struggle to revitalize the country by strengthening the unity of democratic forces and realizing the Constitution of the Italian Republic.

The meeting unanimously adopted a resolution instructing the leading bodies of the Italian Communist Youth League to contact the leading bodies of the Socialist Youth Organization in order to convene a joint meeting to discuss the future of developing the Italian democratic youth movement.

    意共讨论争取地方自治机关民主化的问题
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社罗马26日讯：意大利全国担任市长、省政委员会主席和委员、市政委员会委员的共产党员在波伦亚举行了会议。召开这次会议的目的是总结在地方自治机关工作的共产党员的工作和确定在将在五月举行的市和省政委员会选举中的任务。
    意大利共产党领导人特拉齐尼在会上作了报告。他指出，在目前，共产党人同社会党人及其他民主团体一起领导着二千二百个市镇（意大利市镇总数为八千个）和二十三个省（总数为七十九个）的自治机关。有三万五千个共产党员是市和省政委员会的委员，他们站在这些岗位上为争取提高广大人民群众的生活水平进行着坚决的斗争。在这次选举中，共产党提出了六万六千个优秀的党员作为候选人，他们今后的任务将是为争取地方自治机关的民主化而斗争。
    新华社据塔斯社罗马讯　意大利共产主义青年团中央委员会在三月二十四日举行全体会议。青年团书记处书记佩拉利在会上作了报告：题目是：“青年共产主义者在即将举行的选举运动中的任务”。
    佩拉利在报告中着重指出，意大利青年共产主义者应当努力把越来越广泛的人民群众吸引到民主运动这一方面来。他指出，把政治看法不同的男女青年团结在一起的广泛阵线会有效地争取解决意大利青年的极其重要的问题：学校制度的民主化，减少青年的失业人数，保障意大利的国家独立和解决裁军问题。
    意大利共产党书记处书记巴叶塔在讲话时指出了意大利民主运动在即将到来的选举中的两项基本任务是：第一、争取在地方政权机关中赢得多数；第二、用加强民主力量的团结和实现意大利共和国宪法的办法展开争取国家复兴的广泛政治斗争。
    会议最后一致通过一项决议，责成意大利共产主义青年团的领导机构同社会党青年组织的领导机构进行接触，以便召开联合会议来讨论展开意大利民主青年运动的前途的问题。
