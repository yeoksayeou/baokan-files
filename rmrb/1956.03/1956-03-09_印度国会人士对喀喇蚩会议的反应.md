Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, 8th dispatch from TASS: The speeches of some heads of delegations attending the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council meeting that opened in Karachi on March 6, and Pakistan's demand for the United States, Britain, and France to support its position on the Kashmir issue, have aroused a stormy reaction among Indian Congressmen. This situation was evident on March 6, when the Indian Council of States, the Rajya Sabha, debated the budget proposal. Members of both the Indian National Congress and the opposition parties demanded that measures be taken to develop India's defense industry, as India is increasingly threatened by military treaties.

    印度国会人士对喀喇蚩会议的反应
    新华社8日讯　塔斯社德里8日讯：出席3月6日在喀喇蚩开幕的东南亚条约组织理事会会议的某些代表团团长的发言和巴基斯坦要求美国、英国和法国支持它在克什米尔问题上的立场一事已经在印度国会人士中间引起暴风雨般的反应。3月6日，印度国会上院联邦院在辩论预算案时表现了这种情况。印度国大党和反对党的议员都要求采取措施来发展印度的国防工业，因为印度愈来愈受到军事条约的威胁。
