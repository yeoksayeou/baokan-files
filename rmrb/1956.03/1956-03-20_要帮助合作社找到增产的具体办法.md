    Helping Cooperatives Find Concrete Ways to Increase Production
    Li Lin, Secretary of the Ping順 County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Shanxi Province
    In January 1956, Ping順 County, Shanxi Province, completed the full socialist cooperativization. As the masses' enthusiasm for labor was further enhanced and the potential for increased production was further tapped, the county committee's original target of increasing grain production by 8.4% this year compared to last year seemed significantly behind. In order to set a relatively advanced target that could inspire the masses' enthusiasm for production and promote the county's cooperatives to revise their production plans for this year, the county committee selected nine cooperatives in the county to pilot the formulation of this year's production plans. The pilot results showed that the Chengguan Cooperative, with the smallest increase in production, planned to increase production by 30% compared to last year, while the Liujia Township Cooperative, with the largest increase in production, planned to increase production by 49.4% compared to last year. After studying and analyzing the situation in the county, the county committee revised the county's agricultural production target to an increase of 36.7% compared to last year.
    After this relatively advanced production increase target was put forward, the county committee instructed all cooperatives in the county to formulate their production plans for this year in light of their specific circumstances. In order to discover and solve problems in the formulation of production plans and guide the movement of formulating production plans to proceed healthily, the county committee conducted a key inspection of the work of revising plans in the cooperatives of six villages. Two abnormal situations were discovered during the inspection. One situation was blind optimism, with only enthusiasm for increasing production and a lack of methods for increasing production, which resulted in some cooperatives formulating production plans that were "high in targets but low in methods." For example, the Hei虎 Cooperative formulated a production plan for this year that would increase production by an average of 140 jin per mu. How would this target be achieved? There were only three methods: increasing fertilizer by 31 dan per mu, expanding Golden Queen corn by fifty mu, and building fifty mu of滩地. According to these three methods, at most, production could only be increased by an average of seventy jin per mu, which means that only half of the target could be achieved. The other situation was endless worries. In particular, cadres in the relatively barren mountainous areas lacked confidence in achieving the production increase plan proposed by the county committee. They emphasized that the mountainous areas were "thin in soil and thick in stone, with no way to increase production," "plans are easy to make but difficult to implement," and "the plains are easy but the mountains are difficult." Therefore, they were pessimistic, negative, and at a loss.
    Based on this situation, the county committee believed that solving the problem of increasing production in the barren mountainous areas was the key to promoting the correct formulation of production increase plans in the county. Therefore, it immediately organized a work team consisting of five responsible cadres and more than twenty staff members of the county committee to go deep into the barren mountainous areas to carry out work. In just eleven days, it helped 36 townships and 43 cooperatives in the barren mountainous areas formulate production plans. More importantly, it summarized the masses' years of experience in increasing production and determined five major measures for increasing production in the barren mountainous areas. Before the full socialist cooperativization, it was difficult to implement these measures on a large scale because the private ownership of land had not been abolished and the enthusiasm for labor could not be fully utilized. But now the situation is very different. However, most cadres, on the one hand, did not see the changes in the situation after full socialist cooperativization, and on the other hand, did not pay attention to summarizing the advanced experiences created by the masses in increasing production. Therefore, they were only pessimistic, negative, and at a loss, with no way to formulate production increase plans that were both advanced and practical. After in-depth investigation by the county committee work team, after discussions with old farmers, after summarizing the existing experience in increasing production in the mountainous areas, and after analyzing the possibility of large-scale promotion of production increase experience after full socialist cooperativization, it was affirmed that barren mountainous areas can also reach and strive to exceed the production increase target proposed by the county committee. The key lies in whether the five major production increase measures can be universally implemented. These five production increase measures are: repairing terraced fields, land processing, promoting improved varieties, expanding paddy fields, and increasing the amount of fertilizer applied and improving the quality of fertilizer. According to the preliminary research results of the county committee work team and the cadres and masses in the mountainous areas, all cooperatives in the 36 townships can repair 8,000 mu of terraced fields, process 26,900 mu of land, promote 12,200 mu of improved varieties, and increase fertilizer application by 45 dan per mu this year. As long as these plans can be realized, it is fully guaranteed to reach the production increase target proposed by the county committee. In this way, those who were originally pessimistic about the large-scale increase in production in the mountainous areas now have confidence, those who originally thought that "there is no way to increase production" also believe that the mountainous areas have great potential for increasing production, and the production increase plans that were originally high in targets and low in methods now have practical content and can be guaranteed to be completed.
    After summarizing the experience of the work team in the barren mountainous areas in helping cooperatives formulate production plans, the county committee, in order to spread these experiences, sent seven county committee members and more than thirty cadres to the countryside in separate groups to help the remaining 74 townships' cooperatives formulate and revise production plans, so as to ensure that their plans are both advanced and practical.
    Facts tell us that in the process of leading agricultural production increase, party organizations must always maintain a clear mind, oppose complacency and criticize conservative ideas, and provide cadres with specific and timely help, teaching them work methods. To achieve this specific and timely help, the only way is to go deep into reality to check in a timely manner, discover problems, and solve problems. Only in this way can there be advanced production plans and guarantees for the realization of advanced plans.

    要帮助合作社找到增产的具体办法
    中共山西省平顺县委书记　李琳
    1956年1月，山西省平顺县完成了全社会主义的合作化。由于群众的劳动积极性进一步提高，由于增产的潜力进一步得到发掘，县委原来提出的今年比去年增产粮食8.4％的指标就显得大大落后了。为了定出一个能够启发群众生产积极性的比较先进的指标，推动全县合作社修订今年的生产计划，县委就在全县选择了九个合作社，作了制定今年生产计划的试点。试点结果，增产计划最少的城关合作社要比去年提高30％，增产计划最多的刘家乡合作社就要比去年提高49.4％。县委经过对全县情况的研究和分析，把全县的农业生产指标修订为比去年提高36.7％。
    这个比较先进的增产指标提出以后，县委就指示全县合作社结合自己的具体情况制定今年的生产计划。为了发现和解决制定生产计划中的问题，指导制定生产计划的运动健康地进行，县委曾对六个村子的合作社修订计划的工作作了重点检查。从检查中发现了两种不正常的情况。一种情况是盲目乐观，光有增产的热情，缺乏增产的办法，以致使得部分合作社制定的生产计划是“指标很高，办法很少”。比如黑虎合作社制定今年的生产计划是平均每亩要增产140斤，如何达到这个指标呢？办法只有三条：每亩增肥31担，扩大金皇后玉米五十亩，兴修滩地五十亩。根据这三条办法充其量平均每亩只能增产七十多斤，就是说，只能达到指标的一半。另一种情况是无穷忧虑。特别是比较贫瘠的山区的干部对实现县委提出的增产规划信心不足，他们强调山区是“土薄石头厚，增产无门路”“计划容易实现难”“平地容易山地难”，因而消极悲观，束手无策。
    根据这种情况，县委认为解决贫瘠山区的增产问题是推动全县正确地制定增产计划的关键，因此，立即以县委的五个负责干部和二十多个工作人员组织了一个工作队，深入贫瘠山区进行工作。在短短十一天的时间内，帮助贫瘠山区的36个乡43个合作社制定了生产计划，更重要的是总结了群众多年来的增产经验，确定了贫瘠山区实行增产的五项主要措施。在全社会主义合作化以前，由于土地私有制度尚未取消，由于劳动积极性不能充分发挥，要大规模的实现这些措施是困难的。而现在的情况却大大不同了。但是，多数干部一方面是没有看到全社会主义合作化以后情况的变化，另一方面也没有注意总结群众创造的这些增产的先进经验，因此他们就只有消极悲观，束手无策，没有办法制定既先进又切实的增产计划。县委工作队经过深入的调查，经过和老农的座谈，经过对山区已有的增产经验的总结，以及分析了全社会主义合作化以后大规模推广增产经验的可能，肯定了贫瘠山区同样可以达到而且可以争取超过县委提出的增产指标，关键在于能不能普遍实现五项增产措施。这五项增产措施是：整修梯田，土地加工，推广良种，扩大水地，增加施肥数量并提高肥料质量。根据县委工作队和山区的干部、群众初步研究的结果，36个乡的所有合作社今年可修梯田八千亩，可加工土地26，900亩，可推广良种12，200亩，可使每亩地增施肥料45担。只要能够实现这些规划，达到县委提出的增产指标是完全有保证的。这样，原来对山区大量增产抱着消极悲观态度的人有了信心了，原来认为“增产无门路”的人也相信山区有很大增产潜力了，原来制定的指标高、办法少的增产计划，现在也有了切实的内容并且可以保证完成了。
    县委在总结了贫瘠山区工作队帮助合作社制定生产计划的经验以后，为了传播这些经验，又由七个县委委员带领三十多个干部分头下乡帮助其余74个乡的合作社制定和修改生产计划，以便保证他们的计划既是先进的，又是切实可行的。
    事实告诉我们，在领导农业增产的过程中，党组织必须经常保持清醒的头脑，既要反对安于现状，批判保守思想，又要给干部以具体的及时的帮助，教给他们工作方法，而要实现这种具体的及时的帮助，唯一的办法就是深入实际及时检查，发现问题，解决问题。只有这样，才能有先进的生产计划，和实现先进计划的保证。
