    Commend the Advanced, Promote the Backward
    Liu Zuwu
    Commending the advanced and criticizing the backward is an important method to raise the masses' awareness and inspire their socialist enthusiasm. It is also the most practical and effective way to conduct political and ideological education among the masses. The Party branch of the Chaoyang Village People's Agricultural Production Cooperative in Taigu County, Shanxi Province, has greatly benefited in raising the consciousness of its members and consolidating the cooperative by gradually learning to use this method.
    So, how did this work begin? What experiences and insights did this Party branch have in applying this method of educating the masses?
    Before July of last year, the Party branch of this cooperative did not fully understand the importance of commending the advanced and criticizing the backward, let alone correctly apply this method. At that time, there were relatively many problems in the cooperative, and the situation was quite chaotic. Members did not cherish public property, and production tools were not repaired when broken. Violations of labor discipline went unaddressed, and some cadres were not held accountable for their irresponsible work. In the spring fertilizer accumulation campaign, although a red flag competition was launched, the leading personnel had serious departmentalism during the final summary and evaluation, and the teams argued and quarreled, failing to reach a result. In the end, it was abandoned.
    Despite the many opinions of the masses, they were unwilling to voice them because the Party branch and cooperative leadership did not fully promote democracy. In July, after the county Party committee issued instructions to rectify the cooperative, the branch, together with the cooperative management committee, studied the rectification issue and determined the policy of rectifying the cooperative by promoting democracy. In order to encourage members to boldly offer opinions, the Party branch not only educated the masses on the need to rely on them to rectify the cooperative but also adopted the following measures to dispel their concerns. On the one hand, cooperative cadres with relatively serious shortcomings in their ideological awareness and work style were required to make self-criticisms to the members. On the other hand, a rule was announced: no one should retaliate against those who made criticisms. This eliminated the members' concerns, and in a few days, 125 suggestions were made regarding improving cooperative leadership, improving business management, improving production technology, and observing labor discipline, cherishing public property, and strengthening unity. The vast majority of these suggestions were about which advanced individuals should be commended and which backward phenomena should be criticized.
    The branch, together with the cooperative management committee, studied these suggestions and accepted most of them, commending the advanced individuals and criticizing the backward phenomena. This was the beginning of the correct application of the method of commending the advanced and criticizing the backward in the cooperative, and it was also the beginning of the gradual consolidation of the cooperative through the full promotion of democracy.
    However, experience has shown that commending the advanced and criticizing the backward is a major undertaking that must be carried out with leadership and planning, and cannot be done carelessly. Otherwise, it will not achieve the real effect of educating the masses. The Party branch of the Minli Agricultural Cooperative was not clear about this issue from the beginning and took a detour. There was a time when this work was carried out with great blindness. Whether it was commendation or criticism, the branch neither studied it in advance nor went through deliberation and discussion among the members. Instead, the leaders of the cooperative decided and announced it at the members' meeting. This could not fully guarantee the correctness and authenticity of the commendation and criticism. Therefore, it not only failed to achieve the purpose of educating the members but also aroused their dissatisfaction. For example, the criticism of member Kong Dingchou was done in this way, and the result did not match the facts, which not only made Kong Dingchou extremely dissatisfied but also aroused the injustice of the masses. Another time, the selection of models was not preceded by good research and discussion, nor were clear model standards stipulated. It was thought that having more model units was good, so eight of the cooperative's nine production teams were rated as "model teams," which lost the meaning of selecting models. Later, the branch learned from these lessons and clarified that only by carrying out mass commendation and criticism in a planned and led manner could practical results be achieved. After that, the branch adopted the following methods and steps to ensure the correct implementation of commendation and criticism. First, based on the production activities and work tasks of each quarter, specific goals (including the quantity and quality of work and the deadlines for completing tasks, etc.) were determined, first by leading cadres and Party and Youth League members for deliberation and discussion, and then by the members for discussion and approval before implementation. After a period of work, members in production teams inspected each other and submitted lists of commendations and criticisms and specific facts to the cooperative management committee. The cooperative management committee conducted a comprehensive review and ranking of the lists and facts submitted by each team and group, and drafted a preliminary plan, which was submitted to the members' meeting for discussion and approval before the commendation and criticism were formally carried out.
    In commending the advanced and criticizing the backward, special attention must be paid to being realistic and grasping the measure. It is necessary to prevent the tendency to portray model figures as perfect and to criticize those who have made mistakes as worthless. This tendency will not only encourage model figures to be arrogant and complacent, and undermine the confidence of those who have made mistakes in correcting them, but also weaken the educational effect on the masses. After realizing this, the branch pointed out the shortcomings and directions for improvement of the advanced figures while commending them. When criticizing the backward, it also paid attention to not negating everything. For example, when commending model member Ji Heyi, on the one hand, his exemplary deeds of obeying leadership, cherishing public property, and enduring hardship were announced in public. On the other hand, his shortcomings of having a bad attitude towards the members were pointed out. When criticizing member Ji Erniu for not listening to the instructions of the team leader and often arguing with everyone, his advantage of working relatively well was also pointed out. In this way, he happily admitted his mistakes.
    In order to make commending the advanced and criticizing the backward a system, the Minli Agricultural Cooperative also adopted some effective methods. In addition to stipulating and implementing a system of small inspections every half month and large inspections every month, a large-scale evaluation campaign was also conducted every quarter. Usually, commendations and criticisms were carried out in production teams or groups in conjunction with inspections and the deployment of production. When typical good people and good deeds, as well as bad people and bad deeds, were discovered, the branch immediately organized propagandists to write allegros and publicize them everywhere. Secondly, "merit books" and "demerit books" were established. From July of last year to now, the exemplary deeds of 31 advanced figures have been written in the "merit book," and 22 people have been added to the "demerit book." "Be sure to get into the 'merit book,' and never get into the 'demerit book,'" has become the members' slogan. An atmosphere of "it is glorious to be advanced, and it is shameful to be backward" has been created throughout the cooperative. The number of advanced individuals is increasing, and the backward phenomena are gradually decreasing. Of the 15 members who were punished in July of last year, 10 have already changed and had their punishments revoked. For example, Wang Yuxi, the production team leader who was warned for being selfish and self-interested, used to be dictatorial in leading production, giving himself more points and others less. Since being punished, his work style has changed. Whether arranging work or assessing work points, he now consults with the team members, and everyone thinks that his work style is democratic and fair. In last year's spring plowing production, the third team was often behind the second team, especially the production team led by Shi Wunian, which was the most backward. The team members only wanted to earn more points and did not want to do heavy work, so they often failed to complete the production tasks. When other teams sent people to help them, they rested at ease. Since the launch of the mass movement of commending the advanced and criticizing the backward, the third team has gradually eliminated its backward state and entered the ranks of the advanced, becoming one of the cooperative's model production teams. The production team led by Shi Wunian is no longer a backward team. The entire team actively works, and the production plan can now be completed ahead of schedule, and three model figures who have been commended have emerged.

    表扬先进，推动落后
    刘祖武
    表扬先进，批评落后，是提高群众觉悟，启发群众社会主义积极性的重要方法，也是对群众进行政治思想教育的最实际最有效的方法。山西省太谷县朝阳村民利农业生产合作社党支部，由于逐步学会了运用这一方法，对社员觉悟的提高和社的巩固都有很大作用。
    那末，这一工作是怎样开展起来的呢？这个党支部在运用这种教育群众的方法中有些什么经验和体会呢？
    在去年7月以前，这个社的党支部还不大懂得表扬先进，批评落后的重要性，更不会正确运用表扬先进批评落后这一方法。当时，社里的问题
  比较多，情况也比较混乱。社员对公共财产不爱护，生产工具坏了不修理。对违反劳动纪律的行为无人过问，有的干部对工作不负责任也得不到纠正。在春季积肥运动中，虽然也开展了红旗竞赛，但到总结评比的时候，由于领导人员有严重的本位主义思想，队与队之间争来吵去评不出个结果。最后也就作罢了。
    尽管群众有很多意见，可是由于党支部和社的领导上没有充分发扬民主，群众也就不愿把自己的意见提出来。7月间，当县委发出整顿合作社的指示以后，支部才协同社务委员会研究了整社问题，确定了发扬民主整顿合作社的方针。为了启发社员大胆地提意见，党支部除向群众作了依靠群众整顿合作社的教育外，还采取了以下办法来解除群众提意见的顾虑。一方面要思想意识和工作作风上有比较严重缺点的社干部向社员作自我批评，另一方面宣布了一条纪律：任何人对批评者不能打击报复。这样便消除了社员的顾虑，几天的工夫，就提出有关改进社务领导、改善经营管理、改进生产技术，以及遵守劳动纪律、爱护公共财物、增强团结等方面的意见125件，其中绝大部分是关于哪些先进人物应该表扬，哪些落后现象应该批评的建议。
    支部就协同社务委员会研究了这些建议，并接受了其中大部分意见，对先进的人物作了表扬，对落后的现象作了批评。这是社里正确运用表扬先进批评落后这一方法的开始，也是这个社充分发扬民主逐步得到巩固的开始。
    但是，经验证明，表扬先进和批评落后是一件大事，必须有领导有计划地进行，不能草率从事。否则，就不能收到真正教育群众的效果。民利农业合作社党支部对这一问题并不是一开始就明确的，而是走过一段弯路的。曾经有一个时期，在进行这一工作中带着很大的盲目性，无论表扬或批评，事先支部既不作研究，又不经过社员群众的酝酿讨论，而是由社的领导人员决定以后，在社员大会上宣布。这样就不能完全保证表扬和批评的正确性和真实性，因此，不但达不到教育社员的目的，反而引起社员的不满。如一次对社员孔顶臭的批评就是这样作的，结果与事实不符，不但使孔顶臭极为不满，也引起群众的不平。还有一次评选模范，事先没有经过很好的研究和讨论，也没有规定明确的模范标准，以为模范单位多了好，结果全社的9个生产组就有8个组被评为“模范组”，这就失去了评选模范的意义。后来支部记取了这些教训，明确了只有有计划有领导地开展群众性的表扬和批评，才能收到实际效果。以后，支部就采取了以下的方法和步骤，保证表扬和批评的正确进行。首先，根据每季的生产活动和工作任务，确定具体的奋斗目标（包括工作数量、质量和完成任务的期限等），先由领导骨干和党、团员进行酝酿讨论，再由社员群众讨论通过，然后贯彻执行。工作任务告一段落以后，以生产小组为单位，社员之间互相进行检查，并且提出表扬和批评的名单和具体事实，交给社务委员会。社务委员会对各队、各组提出的名单和事实进行全面的审查、排队，并且拟出初步的方案，提交社员大会讨论通过，然后才正式进行表扬和批评。
    在表扬先进和批评落后的时候，必须特别注意实事求是和掌握分寸，必须防止把模范人物说的十全十美，把犯错误的人批评的一钱不值的偏向。这种偏向不但会助长模范人物骄傲自满、打击犯错误的人改正错误的信心，而且也会减弱对群众的教育作用。支部在体会到这一点以后，在表扬先进的同时，给先进人物指出他的缺点和努力的方向。在批评落后时，也注意不抹煞一切。如表扬模范社员籍合义的时候，一方面当众宣布了他服从领导、爱护公共财物、吃苦耐劳的模范事迹，另一方面又指出他对社员态度不好的缺点。在批评社员籍二牛不听组长的指挥，常和大家吵嘴的时候，也指出了他劳动较好的优点，这样他就愉快地承认了错误。
    为了使表扬先进和批评落后成为一种制度，民利农业合作社还采取了一些有效的方法。除规定并执行了半月一次小检查、一月一次大检查的制度外，每季还要进行一次规模较大的评比运动，平时则结合检查和布置生产等工作，以生产队或组为单位进行表扬和批评。发现典型的好人好事和坏人坏事，支部就马上组织宣传员编写快板，到处宣传。其次，建立了“记功簿”和“记过簿”，从去年7月到现在，已经有31个先进人物的模范事迹写在“记功簿”上，并有22个人上了“记过簿”。“一定要上‘记功簿’，千万不要上‘记过簿’”，已成为社员的行动口号。全社已经造成先进光荣、落后可耻的空气，先进的人物越来越多，落后的现象逐渐减少。去年7月间受处分的15个社员，已经有10个人有了转变而取消了处分。如曾因自私自利受到警告处分的生产组长王玉喜，过去领导生产总是独断专行，记分时给自己多记，给别人少记。自从受处分以后，作风有了转变，不论安排活计和评定工分，都要和组员商议，大家认为他的作风民主了，办事公道了。第三队在去年春耕生产中，经常落在第二队的后面，特别是该队石午年领导的生产小组最落后；组员们光想多记分，不想作重活，常常完不成生产任务。别的组派人帮助他们，他们却自在地歇晌去了。自从群众性的表扬先进批评落后的运动展开以后，第三队逐步消灭了自己的落后状态，进入了先进的行列，成为全社模范生产队之一。石午年领导的生产小组也再不是一个落后小组了，全组积极劳动，生产计划已能够提前完成，还出现了3个受到表扬的模范人物。
