Xinhua News Agency, March 4th, from the Antarctic "Peace" Village via TASS: Autumn has arrived in Antarctica. The sun is not as bright as it was last week, the days are significantly shorter, and the weather is gradually getting colder. Strong southeasterly winds blow from the interior of the Antarctic continent to the Pravda Coast, where the Soviet expedition's "Peace" Village is located. At night, the temperature drops to minus 11 to 12 degrees Celsius.

　　March 1st, according to the calendar, is the first day of autumn in Antarctica. From that morning on, the skies above the Antarctic Circle were covered with a gray layer of clouds. The dazzling ice peaks of the previous two days have become dim. Fat penguins lazily waddle back and forth on overlapping ice floes.

　　Under particularly severe navigation conditions, the diesel-electric ship "Ob" began its 32,000-kilometer long-distance voyage at the end of February. Carrying a portion of the expedition members, it will sail from the east coast of Antarctica through the Indian Ocean, Australia, and the North Atlantic back to Leningrad for a three-month research voyage. The remaining research vessel "Lena" has to constantly maneuver between frequently shifting icebergs. Anchoring is impossible due to the great depth of the water, and drifting is difficult due to the rapid currents and numerous reefs.

　　Communication between the "Lena" and "Peace" Village relies entirely on helicopters landing thirty to forty times each day. From the plane, one can see from afar the construction scene unfolding on the snow-covered Antarctic coast. The Soviet red flag flies high over the two-kilometer-long "Peace" Village. The first building, a dining hall and club, has been erected in the center of the village. Prefabricated houses, offices, fuel depots, an airport, a radio station, and a meteorological station are all under construction. Life in "Peace" Village proceeds in an orderly fashion. The people establishing a scientific city on the sixth continent have become accustomed to quickly adapting to changes in the weather. When there are no blizzards, everyone works outdoors—carrying out the final construction projects of "Peace" Village. And when a major storm arrives, they work indoors on repairs.

　　In late February, the expedition's aircraft also completed the first reconnaissance flight deep into the Antarctic continent, examining the conditions for establishing the Soviet Union's second Antarctic scientific station in the polar region.

    来自南极“和平”村的信息
    新华社4日讯  据塔斯社南极“和平”村讯：南极的秋天已经来到，太阳已不像上星期那么光亮，白天显著地缩短，天气逐渐冷起来。强烈的东南风从南极大陆内地吹到苏联考察队“和平”村所在的真理岸。夜里温度下降到零下11度至12度。
    3月1日，按照日历是南极秋季的头一天，从这天早晨起，南极圈的上空都笼罩着一片灰暗的云层。前两天还闪烁耀眼的冰峰已经昏暗起来。肥胖的企鹅在重叠的冰块上懒洋洋地滚来滚去。
    在航行的条件特别恶化的情况下，“鄂毕号”柴油电动船2月尾已开始了32，000公里的远程航行。它载着一部分考察人员由南极东岸将驶经印度洋、澳大利亚、北大西洋回到列宁格勒，作3个月的考察航行。留在这里的“勒拿号”考察船只好在经常乱动的冰山之间不停地移动。由于海水太深，抛锚停泊是不可能的，由于水急礁多，漂流也是困难的。
    “勒拿号”和“和平”村的来往交通全靠每天着陆三、四十次的直升飞机。在飞机上老远就可以看到展现在白雪皑皑的南极海岸边的建设景象。在绵延两公里的“和平”村上，苏联的红旗高高飘扬着。村中心盖起了第一幢食堂、俱乐部大楼。活动房屋、办公室、燃料仓库、飞机场、无线电台、气象站等都在陆续建筑起来。“和平”村的生活是按部就班地进行的。在第六大洲上建立科学城市的人们已经习惯迅速地适应天气的转变。在没有暴风雪的时候，大家都进行室外的工作——进行“和平”村的最后建设工程。而在大暴风来临的时候，他们就在室内从事整修工作。
    2月下旬，考察队的飞机还完成了第一次深入南极大陆的侦察飞行，检查了在极区建立苏联第二个南极科学站的条件。
