    Oppose Generalized Leadership

    The spring plowing preparation work in Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, is developing very unevenly. The differences between districts are very large. Some districts are doing a good job in preparing for spring plowing, while others are doing poorly; some cooperatives are doing well, while others are doing poorly. In terms of farmland irrigation and water conservancy construction, Tangshi and other districts that started earlier have basically finished, but some districts have not even started yet. Regarding the preparation of base fertilizer for autumn fields, some cooperatives have done a very poor job in accumulating fertilizer. For example, a senior cooperative in Lupu Township, Gusu District, has only accumulated 30% of the base fertilizer needed for autumn fields.

    The main reason for the above phenomenon is the generalized leadership in this county. Some leaders in this county do not see the problems in the work, especially the lack of strengthened leadership in areas with lagging work.

    Judging from the example of Changshu County, strengthening the leadership of areas with weak work, so that the spring plowing preparation work in these areas can catch up with the advanced areas, is an important key to doing a good job in spring plowing preparation work across the board.

    反对一般化的领导
    江苏省常熟县的春耕准备工作发展很不平衡。区和区之间的差别很大。有的区的春耕准备工作做得好，有的区做得差；有的社做得好，有的社做得差。在兴修农田水利方面，唐市等动工较早的区，已经基本结束，但有的区至今还没有动工。在秋田基肥准备工作方面，有些社的积肥工作做得很差，例如古苏区陆浦乡的一个高级社秋田基肥只积了30％。
    产生以上现象的主要原因，是这个县的领导工作一般化。这个县有些领导人看不到工作中的问题，特别是对工作落后的地区没有加强领导。
    从常熟县的例子看来，加强对工作薄弱地区的领导，使这些地区的春耕准备工作赶上先进地区，是普遍做好春耕准备工作的一个重要关键。
