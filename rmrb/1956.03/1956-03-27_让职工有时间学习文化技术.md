Ensuring workers have sufficient spare time to study, enabling them to adapt to the needs of production development, and rapidly improve their cultural and technical levels is an important task for Party organizations in factories and mines.

According to the teaching plan, literacy classes and spare-time primary schools should have six hours of classes per week, spare-time junior high schools eight hours per week, and spare-time senior high schools, spare-time secondary specialized schools, and spare-time universities require even more time for study. However, the amount of leisure time workers have each week should not be excessive, generally controlled to around twelve hours. However, in many factories and mines, workers' spare time is mainly used by Party organizations, trade union organizations, and Communist Youth League organizations for various meetings and activities, leaving very little time for workers to study culture and technology. For example, the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant stipulates that every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday, from 4:15 PM to 5:45 PM, is trade union activity time, and every worker must participate. Every Tuesday and Thursday, there are also two hours of Party member and Youth League member activity time. Party organizations, trade union organizations, and Youth League organizations occupy eight hours of spare time, and the actual number of meetings is even more than stipulated. Individual factories and mines even use tactics such as delaying the departure of shuttle buses or locking the factory gates to force the masses of workers to attend meetings in their spare time. Therefore, for many years, cultural learning in many factories and mines has been planned but without time. The problem of not having time to study is more serious among grassroots cadres, activists, Party members, and Youth League members than among ordinary workers. Although the number of meetings that branch secretaries of the Datong Coal Mine must attend each month has been streamlined, there are still twenty-seven or eight types. Naturally, it is difficult for them to find time to participate in learning. Li Yinling, the branch secretary of the first spinning workshop of the Shanghai State-owned No. 2 Cotton Mill, started reading junior high school textbooks in 1951, and by the winter of 1955, she was still only reading the textbooks for the second grade of junior high school.

If this situation cannot be changed quickly, not only will regular vocational education for workers not be guaranteed, but it will also affect the completion of the national plan. It should be recognized that, as a whole, the cultural and technical level of workers is gradually improving, but in some factories and mines, the technical level of workers is relatively declining because a large number of skilled workers are being transferred to support new factories. Taking the Shijingshan Power Plant as an example, the technical level of the plant's workers was originally not fully adapted to the needs of production development. In recent years, due to the large-scale transfer of old skilled workers to various newly built factories and the large-scale influx of new workers with lower technical levels, the average technical grade of the entire plant has continued to decline: 4.46 in 1951, 4.22 in 1953, and 3.88 in 1955. This situation is obviously in sharp contradiction with the requirements of industrial production development. If this situation cannot be changed quickly, there will not be sufficient guarantee for completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota. The main way to resolve this contradiction is to give workers sufficient spare time to study and to organize workers to carry out cultural and technical studies in a guided and planned manner.

Reducing meeting activities in factories and mines during spare time needs to be approached from two aspects. First, the way leading organs at all levels assign tasks to factories and mines must be improved. Not only the responsible economic leading organs and local Party committees assign work to factories and mines, but also the superior trade unions, Communist Youth League, and government departments of culture, education, health, public security, and supervision. These organs each have their own work focus, each wants its own materials, and each emphasizes the importance of its own work, which should be done first. Since every task must be done, the leaders of factories and mines have no choice but to encroach on the spare time of workers and hold meetings one after another to assign work. This is one of the main reasons for the excessive number of meetings in enterprises. When the central departments issue instructions, they should pay attention to this point, and the provincial and municipal Party committees bear the main responsibility for reversing this chaotic situation. The provincial and municipal Party committees should, in accordance with the principle of "overall planning, strengthening leadership," make overall arrangements for the main tasks to be done by enterprises within a year, that is, the work assigned by various departments and the work needed by enterprises. When arranging the work of factories and mines, it is necessary to consider ensuring that workers have sufficient time for spare-time learning. The departments and mass organizations of the provincial and municipal Party committees and the provincial and municipal People's Committees should also put forward work requirements according to the characteristics of factories and mines. Social activities that do not need to be carried out in factories and mines should not be proposed to factories and mines; activities that need to be carried out in factories and mines should also be specifically arranged according to the nature of the tasks and the characteristics of factories and mines. Things that do not necessarily need to be known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people should generally not be rigidly stipulated to be reported in meetings among the masses. Even for things that must be known to every household, it should be considered what should be done by the factory and what should be handled by the competent authorities in a unified manner within the city or district. Matters should be handled according to the following principle: hold fewer meetings if possible, and do not hold meetings if possible. After sufficient investigation and research and putting forward measures, all departments should also report their requirements to the Party committee for approval before issuing them. The industrial work department of the provincial and municipal Party committees should strengthen its work in this regard and promptly put forward specific opinions to the Party committee on the unified arrangement of political work in enterprises, so as to overcome the phenomenon of multiple leadership in enterprises. The Party organizations in enterprises have the responsibility to weigh the priorities of various tasks and arrange them separately. Therefore, for work that has not been uniformly deployed by the local Party committee and is indeed not necessary to carry out immediately in the enterprise, it should be postponed.

To reduce meeting activities, it is also necessary to improve the work of Party organizations in factories and mines. Party organizations in factories and mines should regard improving the cultural and technical level of workers and rapidly cultivating intellectuals from the working class as their major and urgent tasks. It was precisely after analyzing the decline in the technical level of the plant's workers and foreseeing the seriousness of this problem that the Party General Branch of the Shijingshan Power Plant was determined to streamline meetings once again, improve leadership methods, and ensure that all workers in the plant had sufficient spare time to study. However, some Party organizations in factories and mines only see some trivial matters in front of their noses, have insufficient understanding of major issues such as improving the cultural and technical level of workers, and turn a blind eye to the sharp contradiction between low technical levels and industrial development. Therefore, they cannot be determined to effectively solve this problem. These Party organizations should quickly change this situation; otherwise, they will soon be in a passive position because this problem cannot be solved.

Will reducing meetings weaken political work in enterprises? Some comrades have such doubts. This is because they only rely on holding meetings to carry out political work and have not analyzed the actual situation of various meetings. Therefore, while streamlining meetings, the Party organization should conduct a specific investigation and analysis of the meeting activities of the enterprise, so that everyone knows that many of the past meetings were repetitive in content, some were dispensable or even unnecessary, and some were unnecessarily long or did not solve many problems due to a lack of sufficient preparation in advance. In this way, everyone will understand that what needs to be reduced are only some meetings that are repetitive in content, dispensable, and unnecessary; at the same time, for meetings that must be held, full preparation should be made before the meeting to make the meeting successful, and the time of the meeting should be short and solve problems. Party organizations and trade union and Communist Youth League organizations should not only use spare time for meeting activities, but also make full use of clubs, libraries, sports activities, and other forms to contact and educate the masses; they should go deep into workshops and workers' dormitories, and their staff, Party members, Youth League members, and activists should often go deep into the masses to conduct individual contact and various forms of lively and small-scale meetings such as forums and chats to understand the situation and solve problems. Since the Tangshan Municipal Party Committee strictly controlled spare time and reduced many unnecessary meetings, some leading cadres in some factories and mines have reflected: "Now we can free up time to go deep into the workshops and get close to the masses," and some workshop cadres have also said: "I have solved more problems for the workers in the classes and groups, I feel more proactive in my work, and there are fewer loopholes in production." Of course, if the Party organization simply stipulates some methods to reduce meetings without simultaneously assisting everyone in improving their work style and work methods, the result will not only be that meetings cannot be reduced and the regular spare-time learning of workers cannot be guaranteed, but also that political work will be affected. This point should be fully noted by enterprise Party organizations.

### 让职工有时间学习文化技术

    让职工有时间学习文化技术
    保证职工有足够的业余学习时间，使职工能够适应生产发展的需要，迅速地提高文化技术水平，这是厂矿党组织的一项重要任务。
    按照教学计划，扫除文盲班和业余小学每周要上课六小时，业余初中每周上课八小时，业余高中、业余中等专业学校和业余高等学校的学习就需要更多的时间。而职工每周的业余活动时间又不能过多，一般应控制在十二小时左右。但是，在很多厂矿里，职工的业余时间主要被党组织、工会组织和青年团组织用来进行各种会议活动，职工的文化技术学习时间很少很少。例如，上海机床厂规定每星期一、二、三、五，四点一刻至五点三刻为工会活动时间，每个职工必须参加。每星期二、四还有两小时党员团员活动时间。党组织、工会组织、团组织把业余时间占去了八小时，实际上的会议比规定的还要多。个别厂矿甚至用晚开交通车或不开工厂大门的办法强迫工人群众在业余时间开会。因此很多厂矿的文化学习几年来都是有计划没时间。没有时间学习的问题在基层干部、积极分子、党员、团员中比一般工人更为严重。大同煤矿的支部书记们每月要参加的会议虽然经过精简，但是仍有二十七、八种。这样，他们当然很难有时间去参加学习。上海国棉二厂第一纺厂前纺车间支部书记李银铃从1951年就读初中文化课本，到1955年冬，还只是读初中二年级的文化课本。
    这种情况如果不能很快地改变，不仅正规的职工业余教育没有保证，而且会影响到国家计划的完成。应该看到这样一种情况：从整体来看，职工的文化技术水平是在逐渐提高，但是从某些厂矿来看，因为大批地抽调技术工人支援新厂，职工的技术水平又在相对地下降。以石景山发电厂为例，这个工厂的职工的技术水平本来就不能完全适应生产发展的需要，近几年来，由于老的技术工人大批输送到各个新建工厂去，新的技术水平不高的工人大批补充进厂，以致全厂技术平均等级不断下降：1951年为4.46级，1953年为4.22级，1955年为 3.88级。这种情况显然和工业生产发展的要求是有着尖锐矛盾的。这种情况如果不能迅速地改变，提前和超额完成五年计划就没有充分的保证。而解决这个矛盾的主要的方法就是给予职工以足够的业余学习时间，有领导地、有计划地组织职工进行文化、技术学习。
    减少厂矿业余时间的会议活动需要从两方面着手。首先必须改善各个系统领导机关对厂矿布置任务的方法。向厂矿布置工作的不仅有主管的经济领导机关、地方党委，还有上级工会、青年团、政府的文教、卫生、公安、监察等部门。这些机关各有各的工作中心、各要各的材料，而且谁都强调自己的工作重要，应该先做。既然每一项任务都是不办不行的，厂矿企业领导者只好侵占职工的业余学习时间，一个接一个地开会布置工作。这是企业中会议过多的主要原因之一。中央各部门在下达指示的时候，应该注意到这一点，而省、市委对于扭转这种混乱情况则负有主要责任。省、市委应该根据“全面规划、加强领导”的方针，对于企业一年内要做的主要工作即各部门所布置的和企业所需要的工作进行总的安排。在安排厂矿的工作时，一定要考虑到保证职工的业余学习有充分时间。省、市委和省、市人民委员会的各部门、各群众团体，还都应该根据厂矿的特点提出工作要求，一般不需要在厂矿进行的社会活动就不要向厂矿提出；需要在厂矿进行的活动也要根据任务的性质和厂矿的特点来具体安排。不是必须家喻户晓深入人心的事情，一般不要硬性规定一定要在群众中开会报告。就是必须家喻户晓的事，也应该考虑那些应该由厂里做，那些应该由主管机关在全市、全区范围内统筹办理。应该根据这样的原则办事：能少开会的就少开会，能不开会的就不开会。在经过充分的调查研究并提出措施后，各部门还应该把自己的要求报请党委批准，而后下达。省、市委的工业工作部在这方面应该加强自己的工作，及时地向党委提出有关统筹安排企业中政治工作的具体意见，克服企业领导的多头现象。企业中的党组织有责任对于各种工作权衡轻重缓急分别进行安排，因此，对于没有经过地方党委统一部署、而且确实没有必要立即在企业中进行的工作，应该缓予执行。
    要减少会议活动，还必须改进厂矿党组织的工作。厂矿党组织应该把提高工人的文化技术水平，迅速地培养工人阶级知识分子当做自己的重大任务和迫切任务。石景山发电厂党总支也就是在分析了本厂职工技术水平下降情况，预见到这个问题的严重性，才有决心再一次地精简会议，改进领导方法，保证全厂职工有充足的业余时间进行学习。但是有些厂矿党组织却只看见自己鼻子前面的一些琐碎事情，对于提高工人文化技术水平这样的重大问题认识不足，对于技术水平低下和工业发展的尖锐矛盾熟视无睹。因此，他们也就不能下决心切实解决这个问题。这些厂矿党组织应该迅速改变这种情况，否则，很快地就会因为这个问题不得解决而陷于被动。
    减少会议是否会削弱企业中的政治工作呢？一部分同志有这样的疑问。这是因为他们只依靠开会来进行政治工作，对于各种会议的实际情况又没有进行分析的原故。因此，在精简会议的同时，党组织应该对企业的会议活动进行具体的调查分析，使大家都知道过去的会议有许多是内容重复的，有些是可开可不开甚至根本不需要开的，有些是因为事前缺乏充分的准备而使会议时间拖得过长或者解决问题不多的。这样，大家就会明白，要减少的只是一些内容重复的、可开可不开的和根本不需要开的会议；同时，对于必须召开的会议，在会前要进行充分的准备来把会议开好，会议的时间要既短又解决问题。党组织和工会、青年团组织不只是要利用业余时间进行会议活动，而且应该充分利用俱乐部、图书馆、体育活动等等形式去联系群众、教育群众；应该深入车间、深入职工宿舍，并使自己的工作人员、党员、团员、积极分子经常深入群众进行个别接触和各种形式的座谈、漫谈等生动活泼的小型会议，去了解情况和解决问题。唐山市的一些厂矿自从市委严格控制业余时间，减少了许多不必要的会议后，有些领导干部反映：“现在可以腾出空来深入车间接近群众了”，车间干部中也有人说：“我给班、组工人解决的问题多了，工作上觉得主动多了，生产上的漏洞也少了。”当然，如果党组织只是简单地规定一些办法去削减会议，而不同时协助大家改进工作作风和工作方法，那么其结果不但是会议不能减少，职工的正规业余学习不能得到保证，还会使政治工作受到影响。这一点，应该引起企业党组织的充分注意。
