    New Gains in Poetry Creation
    ——Reading the “Selected Poems” Edited by the Chinese Writers Association——
    Shao Yanxiang
    The "Selected Poems" edited by the Chinese Writers Association, compiles 120 short poems from September 1953 to December 1955. These relatively outstanding works prove that China's socialist realist poetry creation has been developing healthily in the past two or three years in the struggle against bad tendencies. Although the achievements already made are not enough to satisfy us, they are sufficient to shatter the counter-revolutionary elements' slander that "lyric poetry has been suppressed;" it is also a resounding answer to those who view literary and artistic creation, especially poetry creation, with a nihilistic eye.
    The authors in this anthology include singers of various nationalities, poets growing up among workers, peasants, and the military, senior poets and young authors; they bring a strong breath of life from all parts of the motherland and various posts, and they talk, appeal, recite, and sing to the people in their own different tones. Under the common socialist ideals, it is possible and necessary to develop a "hundred flowers blooming" style. We need diverse good poems, as long as they are good poems. It is necessary to break the narrow sectarianism that exists consciously or unconsciously; do not "draw a circle on the ground" and think that poetry can only have one or two genres, actually excluding some folk poetry forms that the people love to see and hear, such as storytelling and fast clapper talk, etc., that would lead our poetry onto the narrow path of "literati poetry." This anthology pays attention to including poems of various genres and styles, which will broaden the horizons of readers and authors. The authors of the anthology are relatively broad, which indicates that the poetry creation team will grow stronger day by day.
    From the anthology, the scope of themes and subject matter has expanded unprecedentedly in the history of Chinese poetry creation. This is due to the large number of new authors from the depths of life supplementing the ranks of poets, and also the result of many poets expanding their horizons of life. Kalinin said, "To love a socialist country cannot be abstract, but must be concrete, that is to say, one must simultaneously love its nature, fields, forests, factories, collective farms, state farms, etc., as well as its male and female Stakhanovite workers, male and female Communist Youth League members. When we love our motherland, we should simultaneously love everything new that exists in the Soviet Union, and express it in a beautiful way, not like my speech to you, but in a truly vivid and artistically beautiful way." ("Kalinin on Literature," p. 77) Most of the authors in the anthology have managed not to explain ideas, but to express ideas, so that through the eyes and voices of poets who love the motherland and love socialism, we feel and recognize the vivid scenes of our country's factories, mines, construction sites, rural areas, border defenses, and Gobi grasslands, the mainstream of life, and the new people and new things emerging from the wind and rain of mass struggles.
    From the anthology, the poets have striven to express the thoughts, feelings, ideals, and aspirations of the people, thus giving their works great social significance. Today's literature is no longer a matter for a few thousand or tens of thousands of people, it should talk about things that concern hundreds of millions of people. The year marked by the anthology was precisely when the Party put forward the general task of the transition period. This general task was also incorporated into the Constitution, inspiring the people of the whole country to fight for the construction of socialism and for the realization of the first Five-Year Plan. Building socialism is "the order of the pioneers of the revolution" and also the common aspiration of 600 million people. The poets breathe and share the destiny of the people in the practice of mass construction of socialism, and to varying degrees reflect the budding socialist thoughts and feelings of the people, and therefore also reflect the spirit of the times to some extent.
    From the anthology, many poets have brought into play the characteristics of poetry as a fighting form, reflecting major events in real life in a timely manner, and participating in our struggles in international relations and domestic life with the language of poetry. Not only political satire poems can intervene in life, all social lyric poems are weapons to participate in actual struggle and promote the progress of life. The problem is that poets must stand at the forefront of the times, represent advanced ideas, and write relatively distinct images. The Party's ideology, Marxism-Leninism, is forever the pointer for the creation of all poets who serve the revolution. With it, when using rich life experience, it is possible to make generalizations of relatively important significance, and even a poem written to cooperate with a major event may have "images and ideas that survive longer than the event that caused the poem to be written" (Isakovsky: "On the Technique of Poetry" p. 121). Some works in the anthology can also prove that poems that actively intervene in life often gain a longer life due to bearing a deeper imprint of the times.
    It should be especially pointed out that the selfless labor of socialist builders has become a source of creation for many poets. A batch of beautiful images of new working-class people have appeared in poetry. The theme of the creative labor of the liberated working class is still a completely new theme in Chinese poetry. This collection of poems in the anthology cannot but be regarded as a good start. When poets express this theme, they reveal the true beauty of labor creation: whether it is the Tieshan Mountain where "the exploration team has not yet left, and the construction team has already set up tents," or the oil mine that "roars during the day and flashes at night," are changing their appearance day by day in the hands of our builders; when poets express the theme of labor, they show people's understanding and confidence in the future of society: the words left on the monument by a team of loggers to the communist builders a hundred years later in "Farewell to the Forest Farm" (Fu Chou), the argument between two young female welders in "Two Girls on the Construction Site" (Chong Shan), truly show the inner world of socialist new people; when poets express the theme of labor, what we see is not wind and warmth, everything is satisfactory, they do not avoid difficulties and tests: Liang Shangquan wrote about the will of the builders of the Kangzang Highway: "The severe cold of more than a thousand days is concentrated in one hour, and we can withstand the test! ... The dangers of more than two thousand kilometers of road are concentrated in one construction site, and we will fight it to the death!" Yan Yi's poem "Life" writes about the heroic behavior of a bridge builder who, in a critical situation, believes that "life can be terminated, but the work of building the bridge cannot be interrupted," conveying a true optimism, not a cheap optimism. Writing about labor in poetry, expressing the life, thoughts, and feelings of the working class, should be given full attention and continued development. There are still too few works in this area.
    Some typical images of socialist new people have already appeared in our poetry, they are workers, peasants, soldiers, working intellectuals, communist party members and youth league members, whether using the first person or the third person, they all express themselves as an active, advanced force with advanced thoughts, feelings and the resulting actions, playing a role in inspiring and educating the reader. However, when it comes to creating typical images in poetry, it is more appropriate to treat it as an urgent goal to strive for, rather than as something that has already been achieved.
    Poetry, like other works, should influence readers and listeners with a spirit of heroic struggle, full of confidence, vigorous, unafraid of difficulties and overcoming difficulties. Poets should capture the thoughts, feelings, experiences and various expressions of will and character of advanced figures from the contradictions and struggles of life, and make concentrated and profound depictions. Only in this way can they create vivid images of new people as examples to learn from and emulate, and complete the task of poetry intervening in life. All successful works, such as Wei Yang's "Give Me the Gun," etc., show that poets must stand at the center of the vortex of struggle and raise their ideological level to the level of the advanced figures they depict, or close to this level, in order to establish typical images on a reliable foundation. The difficulties faced by this new type of person are real difficulties, and his spiritual strength to overcome difficulties has deep and broad sources, so that the process of overcoming difficulties is not easy; in this way, whether the poet writes narrative poems or lyric poems, uses the first person or the third person, the typical image he shapes will be flesh and blood and exciting.
    The technique of poetry creation must not be understood as the technique of writing poetry; it is first of all the ability to understand life and express it in a generalized way. In complex life and struggle, what is the essence and the mainstream? What are the most socially significant, acute and urgent questions? What is advanced that should be supported and promoted, and what is backward and hostile that should be attacked and eliminated? The solution of these problems is consistent with the creative process and is a prerequisite for the creation of truly highly ideological works.
    In addition, in terms of technique, it should be pointed out that many works in the anthology have plots that are directly or indirectly displayed, which is the basis of the work's conception and also an important means of expressing the conception. The vast majority of works can be recited or sung, spoken and sung, with rhythm or rhyme, thus providing a bridge to combine with the broad masses. Some poems have refined content of great significance in short passages, enriching the expressive techniques of poetry; this will serve as a demonstration for many authors, especially young authors.
    Due to space limitations, it is impossible to list them all here. I believe that when you read this anthology, you will, like me, be delighted by the gains in poetry creation in the past two or three years; at the same time, you will see that, in terms of ideology and technique, in terms of the creation of typical figures and the degree of intervention in life, poetry creation still lags far behind the requirements of the country, the people and the times. For example, we have some better poems reflecting socialist construction, but there are still few works that profoundly reveal the contradictions in social reform; sharp and spicy satirical poems that criticize bad phenomena in life are also still underdeveloped. Poets should use the revolutionary spirit of never being satisfied and not being content with existing achievements to inspire the people, and first of all use this spirit to demand of themselves. Let this collective of poets composed of our senior poets, young authors and folk singers, in the high tide of the motherland's socialist revolution, always maintain and improve their sensitivity to new things, sing tens of thousands of powerful new songs with full political enthusiasm, clear love and hate, and the continuous pursuit of technique!

    诗歌创作上的新收获
    ——读中国作家协会编的“诗选”——
    邵燕祥
    中国作家协会编的“诗选”，选辑了1953年9月到1955年12月的短篇诗歌作品120首。这些比较优秀的作品证明，我国的社会主义现实主义诗歌创作，两三年来在同坏倾向的斗争中健康地发展着。已有的成绩虽然还不能使我们满足，但是已经足够粉碎反革命分子的“抒情诗被压死了”的诬蔑；对于以虚无主义的眼光看待文艺创作特别是诗歌创作的人，也是一个响亮的回答。
    这本选集的作者，包括各民族的歌手，工人、农民、部队中成长的诗人，年长的诗人和青年作者；他们从祖国的各个地方、各种岗位带来浓厚的生活气息，他们用各自不同的声调向人民倾谈、号召、说唱、歌咏着。在共同的社会主义理想下可能而且必须发展“百花齐放”的风格。我们需要多种多样的好诗，只要是好诗。要打破有意识或无意识地存在的狭隘的门户之见；不要“画地为牢”地认为诗歌只能有一种两种体裁，实际上排斥了人民群众喜见乐闻的若干民间诗歌形式，例如说唱、快板等等，那就会使我们的诗歌走上“文人诗”的狭路。这本选集注意了包罗各种体裁和风格的诗歌，将会打开读者和作者的眼界。选集的作者是比较广泛的，这预示着诗歌创作的队伍将要一天比一天壮大。
    从选集中看，主题和题材的范围，在我国诗歌创作历史上是空前地扩大了。由于众多的来自生活深处的新作者补充了诗人队伍，也是许多诗人扩展了生活视野的结果。加里宁说过，“爱社会主义国家不能只是抽象地，而必须是具体地，也就是说，必须同时爱它的自然、田野、森林、工厂、集体农庄、国营农场，等等，还有它的男女斯达汉诺夫工作者，男女共青团员。我们爱祖国，应当同时爱存在于苏联的一切新事物，并且用美丽的样子来表现它，不要像我对你们演说那样，而要用真正鲜明的、富有艺术美的样子来表现。”（“加里宁论文学”，第77页）选集的大部分作者做到了不是说明思想，而是表现思想，这样我们就通过热爱祖国、热爱社会主义的诗人的眼睛和声音，感觉到和认识到我国工厂、矿井、工地、农村、边防线上和戈壁草原各方面的生动景象，生活的主流和群众斗争的风雨中涌现的新人物、新事物。
    从选集中看，诗人们努力表现了人民群众的思想、感情、理想和愿望，因而使作品有了重大的社会意义。今天的文学已经不是几千人、几万人的事情，它应该讲千百万人关心的东西。选集标志的年月，正是党提出了过渡时期的总任务。这一总任务又列入了宪法，鼓舞着全国人民为建设社会主义、为实现第一个五年计划而奋斗的时期。建设社会主义，这是“革命的前驱者的命令”，也是六亿人民的共同愿望。诗人们在群众建设社会主义的实践中和人民同呼吸共命运，在不同程度上反映了人民群众萌芽的社会主义的思想感情，也就多少反映了时代的精神。
    从选集中看，许多诗人发挥了诗歌这种战斗性的形式的特点，及时地反映了现实生活中的重大事件，以诗的语言参加了我们在国际关系和国内生活中的斗争。不止政治讽刺诗可以干预生活，一切社会抒情诗都是参加实际斗争、推动生活前进的武器。问题在于诗人要站在时代的前列，要代表着先进的思想，要写出比较鲜明的形象。党的思想，马克思列宁主义思想永远是一切为革命服务的诗人的创作的指针。有了它，在利用丰富的生活经验的时候，就可以作出比较有重要意义的概括，即使为配合某一个重大事件所写的诗，也可能具有“比引起写这篇诗的事件生存得更长久的形象与思想”（伊萨可夫斯基：“谈诗的技巧”第121页）。选集中的一些作品也可以证明：积极干预生活的诗由于带着更深的时代的烙印，往往会获得更长久的生命。
    应该特别提出来的是，社会主义建设者的忘我劳动，成了许多诗人的创作源泉。在诗歌里出现了一批工人阶级新人的优美的形象。工人阶级解放了的创造性劳动的主题，在我国诗歌中还是个完全新的主题。选集中的这一辑诗，不能不看作一个良好的开端。诗人们在表现这个主题的时候，揭示了劳动创造的真正的美：无论“勘探队还没有离开，工程队已经扎下篷帐”的铁山，还是“白天发着巨响黑夜闪着光”的油矿，都在我们建设者手中日新月异地改变着面貌；诗人们在表现劳动主题的时候，表现出人们对社会前途的了解和信心：“告别林场”（傅仇）中一队伐木者给一百年以后的共产主义建设者在树碑上留下的话，“工地两姑娘”（重山）中两个年青的电焊女工的争论，真实地展现了社会主义新人的内心世界；诗人们在表现劳动主题的时候，使我们看到的不是风和日暖，万事如意，他们没有回避困难和考验：梁上泉这样写到康藏公路建设者的意志：“一千多个日子的严寒，都集中在一个时辰，我们也经得住考验！……两千多公里路的艰险，都集中在一个工地，我们也要与它决战！”雁翼的诗“生命”写到一个架桥工人在危急的情况下认定“生命可终止，架桥的工作不可中断”的英雄行为，传达出一种真正的乐观主义，而不是廉价的乐观主义。在诗歌中抒写劳动，表现工人阶级的生活、思想、感情，是应该充分注意，并且继续发展的。这方面的作品还是太少了。
    我们的诗歌中已经出现了一些社会主义新人的典型形象，他们是工人、农民、战士、劳动知识分子、共产党员和青年团员，无论是使用第一人称或是第三人称，他们都以先进的思想、感情和从而产生的行为，表现为一种积极的、先进的力量，对读者发生鼓舞和教育的作用。但是，说到在诗歌中创造典型形象，与其当做已经做到的事，不如当作迫切需要努力的目标更加合适。
    诗歌和其他作品一样，应该以英勇奋斗、满怀信心、生气勃勃、不怕困难并且克服困难的精神影响读者和听众。诗人要从生活的矛盾和斗争中，去把捉先进人物的思想、感情的体验和意志与性格的种种表现，作集中的深刻的刻划，只有这样才能创造出新人的鲜明的形象，作为学习仿效的榜样，完成诗歌干预生活的任务。所有成功的作品，例如未央的“枪给我吧”等，都说明诗人要站在斗争的漩涡的中心，并且使自己的思想水平提高到所描绘的先进人物的水平，或接近这个水平，才可能把典型形象树立在可靠的基础上，这个新人的典型所面对的困难是实实在在的困难，他克服困难的精神力量有深广的源泉，以至他克服困难的过程也不是轻而易举的；这样，不管诗人写叙事诗还是写抒情诗，用第一人称还是用第三人称，他所塑造的典型形象就会是有血有肉、激动人心的了。
    诗歌创作的技巧，决不能理解作写诗的技术；它首先是认识生活，概括地表现生活的能力。在复杂的生活和斗争中，什么是本质和主流？什么是最有社会意义的尖锐的迫切的问题？什么是先进的应该支持和发扬的，什么是落后的敌对的应该打击和消灭的？这些问题的解决是同创作过程相一致的，并且是创作真正具有高度思想性的作品的前提。
    另外，在技巧方面应该指出：选集中的许多作品都有直接或间接显示的情节，这是作品构思的依托，也是表现构思的重要手段。绝大部分作品可以朗诵或歌咏、说唱，有节奏或韵律，因而有了同广大群众结合的桥梁。有些诗在短小的篇幅里提炼了具有重大意义的内容，丰富了诗歌的表现手法；这对于许多作者特别是青年作者将起示范的作用。
    因为篇幅关系，这里不可能一一举例。我相信大家在读这本选集的时候，会像我一样为两三年来诗歌创作的收获感到欢欣；同时看到，就思想性和技巧，就典型的创造和干预生活的程度看来，诗歌创作还远远落后于国家、人民和时代的要求，例如我们有了一些较好的反映社会主义建设的诗，但是深刻地揭示社会改革中的矛盾的作品还很少；抨击生活中坏现象的犀利火辣的讽刺诗也还是不发达的。诗人要用永不满足、不安于现有成就的革命精神鼓舞人民，首先要用这种精神要求自己。让我们的长辈诗人、青年作者和民间歌手们组成的这个诗人集体，在祖国社会主义革命的高潮中，永远保有和提高对新事物的敏感，以饱满的政治热情，明确的爱憎，对技巧的不断追求，唱出千万首强有力的新歌！
