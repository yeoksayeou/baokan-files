    The National Wool Textile Technology Conference held in Shanghai decided to vigorously promote eighty-eight advanced technical experiences this year to improve the quality of wool textiles and increase forty new varieties. These new varieties are planned to be put into production in 1957. The conference also planned fifty-three national wool textile science and technology research projects for the next two years.

    The eighty-eight advanced technical experiences that the conference decided to promote are all effective experiences promoted by wool textile factories in various regions. The representatives repeatedly discussed the experiences of the Beijing Qinghe Woolen Mill and wool textile factories in Shanghai and other regions in reducing yarn breakage and improving the quality and output of wool combing machines. The state-owned Shanghai No. 1 and No. 3 Wool Textile Factories learned from Poland's fulling and washing techniques, which made the nap tight and beautiful, and increased the first-class product rate to over 99%. The state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Wool Textile Factory successfully trial-produced papermaking blankets woven with a blend of 20% synthetic fiber and wool, which only increased the cost by 7% and could nearly double the service life of the blankets. The above advanced experiences were all specially introduced this time.

    Twenty-nine state-owned and joint state-private wool textile factories across the country signed an inter-factory socialist competition contract in Shanghai on the 27th. The central content of the competition is to improve product quality, increase variety and colors, and ensure the early and over-fulfillment of the country's first five-year plan. Representatives from wool textile factories in Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Shanghai and other places who participated in the inter-factory competition all expressed at the meeting that they had the confidence and determination to complete the tasks assigned by the state. The specific method is to conscientiously promote eighty-eight advanced technical experiences. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    全国毛纺织业决定推广八十八项先进技术经验
    在上海举行的全国毛纺织技术专业会议，决定在今年大力推广八十八项先进技术经验，提高毛纺织品的质量，还要增加四十种新品种，这些新品种准备在1957年投入生产。会议同时规划了今明两年全国毛纺织科学技术研究项目共五十三项。
    这次会议决定推广的八十八项先进技术经验，都是各地区毛纺织厂推行有效的经验。代表们对北京清河制呢厂和上海等地区毛纺织厂减少细纱断头、提高梳毛机的质量和产量等经验，作了反复讨论。国营上海第一和第三毛纺织厂学习波兰缩绒洗呢的经验，使绒面紧密、漂亮，成品一等品提高到99％以上；国营上海第一毛纺织厂试制成功用20％合成纤维和羊毛混纺织的造纸毛毯，成本只增加7％，可以提高毛毯使用寿命将近一倍。以上的先进经验这次都作了专门介绍。
    全国二十九个国营和公私合营毛纺织厂，二十七日在上海签订厂际社会主义竞赛合同。竞赛的中心内容是要提高产品质量，增加花色品种，保证提前和超额完成国家第一个五年计划。参加厂际竞赛的北京、天津、沈阳、上海等地毛纺织厂的代表，都在会上表示有信心、有决心完成国家交给的任务。具体办法是认真推广八十八项先进技术经验。　（据新华社讯）
