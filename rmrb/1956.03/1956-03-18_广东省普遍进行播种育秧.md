Guangdong Province is universally carrying out sowing and nursery raising. In Hainan Island, where the season is earlier, rice transplanting has been basically completed. This year, spring plowing in various regions generally started 10 days to half a month earlier than in previous years. The state has supplied farmers with more than 40 million jin of improved seeds. The seeds sown have all been selected using salt water or yellow mud water, and strong seedlings are being cultivated by using the method of sparse sowing on standardized seedling fields.

In the past three months, all counties in the province have launched mass movements for manure accumulation and water conservancy construction. Up to now, more than 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu has been accumulated in 20 counties including Chao'an, Chenghai, and Dianbai. The province's largest Lubao Sluice project has been completed, and more than 60% of the small-scale farmland water conservancy projects in various regions have also been completed. The Zhanjiang Special Zone, which has been most seriously threatened by drought in past years, is no longer threatened by ordinary droughts in 640 townships of 10 counties this year due to the farmers' active efforts to dig wells and ponds.

    广东省普遍进行播种育秧
    广东省的农民正在普遍进行播种育秧，季节较早的海南岛已基本完成了插秧。今年各地春耕一般都比往年提早了10天到半个月。国家供应给农民的良种在4，000万斤以上。播下的种子都经过盐水或黄泥水选种，并采用在合式秧田上疏播的方法培育壮秧。
    全省各县近三个月来开展了群众性的积肥和兴修水利运动。到目前止，潮安、澄海、电白等20个县每亩积肥已经超过10，000斤。全省最大的芦苞水闸工程已经完成，各地的小型农田水利工程也已经完成了60％以上。历年来受旱灾威胁最严重的湛江专区，今年由于农民积极展开了打井、挖塘运动，10个县的640个乡已从此不再受普通旱灾的威胁。
