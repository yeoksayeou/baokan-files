Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, March 22nd: Spring has arrived in Sichuan Province, the "Land of Abundance." This is the first spring after the basic realization of agricultural cooperation in the province, and the countryside is full of extraordinary busyness and joy. March 20th was the vernal equinox on the lunar calendar. This agency's rural reporter in Sichuan Province reported on their observations in various locations that day.

That morning, in the Dujiangyan area, a group of migrant workers from Pi County, Chongning, Chengdu and other four counties and cities were braving the rain to rush to repair the final part of the Neijiang Zouma River annual maintenance project. Soon, the newly built diversion gate on the Zouma River will be opened, and the water outside the gate will flow through the spider web-like ditches to the boundless western Sichuan Plain. The other two rivers of Dujiangyan, Pujiang River and Baitiao River, had already started releasing water at the end of January, more than a month earlier than in previous years.

Farmers in the western Sichuan Plain also started spring ploughing and production earlier this year than in previous years, by one or two solar terms. Double-cropping rice has not been planted here in the past, but this year it is planned to plant 200,000 mu. On the vernal equinox, early rice sowing generally began. The Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative of Hexing Township, Pi County, organized six inspection teams on this day to conduct a surprise inspection of the cooperative's spring ploughing preparations. In the evening, 28 production teams held "Patriotic Day" activities, and the members said that they would win the battle in spring ploughing and increase grain production to support national construction. The cooperative affairs committee specially issued a notice in the bulletin to commend the member Cai Chongde, who had done an outstanding job in preparing for cultivation, and called on everyone to learn from him.

In the terraced fields along the Yangtze River, farmers could be seen everywhere shouting at their cattle, with the cattle pulling new-style walking plows, turning the fields. The early rice sown in this area has already shown new green seedlings, which will soon be transplanted. The Shuguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shizhong Township, Fuling County, dispatched more than fifty head of cattle to rush to plow dry fields. The cooperative's old feeder, Feng Shaowu, carried grass to the fields to feed the cattle, so that the cattle would not have to run back and forth and have more time to rest. While feeding them, he said: "Work harder, it won't be hard for many years, and 'iron cattle' will replace you." The mild climate and long frost-free period along the Yangtze River will be more fully utilized this year. Last year, only 50,000 mu of double-cropping rice were planted in the three districts of Yibin, Luzhou, and Jiangjin, but this year it is planned to plant more than 3.8 million mu. Some agricultural production cooperatives have also begun to try planting three crops of rice.

In Duwei Township, a suburb of Nanchong City, near the Jialing River, the competition to increase planting and accumulate fertilizer, which lasted for more than 40 days, reached a climax on the vernal equinox. All of the more than 9,000 laborers in the six agricultural production cooperatives in the township, except for the old, weak, and disabled, were mobilized. On this day, the township accumulated a total of 500,000 jin of fertilizer, which was a higher record in the movement. This year, the township is preparing to increase the planting of one season or two seasons of crops. In addition to double-cropping rice, there are also various melons, fruits, and vegetables. Cornfields that used to be planted for one season a year will now be planted for two or three seasons. The Huohua Agricultural Production Cooperative is preparing to sow the first crop of three-season corn, and the seedlings are already more than an inch tall.

In the Tuojiang River basin, an economic crop area, the vernal equinox was a good day, and farmers were planting the last batch of sugarcane in the fields. By this time, the Neijiang Special District of this basin had planted 350,000 mu of sugarcane, an increase of more than 70,000 mu over last year, and more than half a month ahead of schedule. When the reporter visited the Shunjiang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shidong Township, Neijiang County, the members said: In previous years, they had not started planting at this time, but this year there are sufficient funds, and there are many people with new technologies, so sugarcane planting is going very smoothly.

### 四川农村春耕中的一天

    四川农村春耕中的一天
    新华社成都22日电　春天来到了“天府之国”的四川省。这是全省基本上实现农业合作化以后的第一个春天，农村中到处呈现特别繁忙和欢欣的景象。三月二十日是农历春分的日子，本社驻四川省农村记者报道了这一天他们在各地的见闻。
    这一天清晨，在都江堰地区有一批来自郫县、崇宁、成都等四个县、市的民工，正在冒雨赶修内江走马河岁修工程的最后部分。不久，走马河上新修的节制闸就要开放，闸门外的水将通过蜘蛛网般的沟渠，流向一望无际的川西平原。都江堰的另外两条河蒲阳河和柏条河，已经在一月底比往年提前一个多月就放水了。
    川西平原农民今年动手进行春耕生产，也比往年早了一、两个节令。过去这里没有种过双季稻，今年计划种二十万亩。春分这一天，早稻播种普遍开始。郫县合兴乡红光农业生产合作社在这一天组织六个检查组，突击检查全社春耕准备工作的情况。入夜，28个生产队分别举行“爱国日”活动，社员们表示，要在春耕中打胜仗，以增产粮食来支援国家建设。社务委员会在快报上特别通报表扬了备耕工作做得出色的社员蔡崇德，号召大家向他学习。
    在沿长江两岸层层叠叠的梯田里，这一天到处可以看到农民吆喝着耕牛，耕牛曳引着新式步犁，在翻犁田地。这一带播种的早稻已经露出新绿的秧针，不久就要栽插。涪陵县世忠乡曙光农业生产合作社出动五十多条耕牛在赶犁干田。社里的老饲养员冯绍武为了让耕牛不来回跑路，有更多的时间休息，把草料背到田边去喂牛。他一边喂，一边说：“加劲干吧，再辛苦不到好多年，就有‘铁牛’来替换你了。”沿长江一带气候温和，无霜期长，这样优越的自然条件今年将被较充分地利用。去年宜宾、泸州、江津三个专区只种植双季稻五万多亩，今年计划种380多万亩。有些农业生产合作社还开始试种三季水稻。
    靠近嘉陵江畔的南充市郊区都尉乡，持续了四十多天的增种、积肥竞赛运动，在春分这一天进入高潮。全乡六个农业生产合作社九千多个劳动力，除老弱残废外，全部出动了。这一天全乡共积堆肥五十万斤，是运动中较高的纪录。这个乡今年准备增种一季或增种两季的农作物品种很多，除了双季稻以外，还有各种瓜果蔬菜。过去一年种一季的玉米地，今年要种两季或三季。火花农业生产合作社准备播种三季的第一季玉米，苗儿出土已经有一寸多高了。
    在经济作物地区的沱江流域，春分这一天是个好天气，农民正在地里种最后一批甘蔗。至此，这个流域的内江专区已经种甘蔗35万亩，比去年扩大了七万多亩，并且提前了半个多月。当记者访问内江县史东乡顺江农业生产合作社的时候，社员们说：往年这个时间还没有动手种地呢，今年资金充分，会新技术的人又多，种甘蔗进行得很顺利。
