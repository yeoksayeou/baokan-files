    Steel Wire Concrete Successfully Trial-Produced
    Pre-stressed steel wire concrete was successfully tested on the 24th at the Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company, and two steel wire concrete beams have already been produced.
    Engineer Hu Rulin, who was in charge of the trial work, explained the significance of the successful trial of steel wire concrete, saying: Components made of steel wire concrete have the properties of not cracking or bending and deforming. It can replace steel structures in general industrial buildings, and can also be used to manufacture water pipes capable of withstanding ten atmospheres of pressure, as well as railway bridge structures. Therefore, it provides important technical conditions for improving the quality of industrial buildings and replacing steel structures more widely. Steel wire concrete can also save a lot of steel and cement.

    钢弦混凝土试制成功
    预应力的钢弦混凝土二十四日在鞍山钢铁建设公司试验成功，并且已经生产了两根钢弦混凝土梁。
    负责试验工作的工程师胡汝林讲述钢弦混凝土试验成功的意义说：钢弦混凝土制造的构件，有着不发生裂纹，不弯曲变形的性能，它可以在一般工业建筑上代替钢结构，也可以制造能耐十个大气压的输水管以及铁路桥梁结构等。因此，它对提高工业建筑的质量，更广泛地代替钢结构，提供了重要的技术条件。钢弦混凝土还可以大量节约钢材和水泥。
