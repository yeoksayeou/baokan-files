    Kingdom of Laos Forms New Cabinet

    The cabinet crisis in the Kingdom of Laos, which lasted for more than a month, was resolved on March 21. The National Assembly of Laos passed the new cabinet of the Kingdom of Laos with Souvanna Phouma as Prime Minister.

    Before the National Assembly voted on the vote of confidence, Prime Minister Phouma once again introduced the policies of his government to the National Assembly. He said that his government would implement five principles, oppose foreign interference in Laos, and establish diplomatic relations with all countries, especially with neighboring countries.

    The reason why the cabinet crisis in the Kingdom of Laos was not resolved for a long time was that the various parties in the National Assembly had differences of opinion on some basic issues of national policy. Since the resignation of the Katay Don Sasorith cabinet on February 14, former Prime Minister Katay had been commissioned to form a cabinet twice, and Phouma and Sananikone had also been commissioned to form a cabinet separately, but none of them obtained the statutory majority in the National Assembly. After many repeated compromises, the National Assembly finally voted in favor of Prime Minister Phouma, who proposed implementing the five principles, which was by no means accidental.

    After the Indochina ceasefire in 1954, the people of Laos obtained peace. They sincerely hoped that Laos would embark on the road of independent development and build their own country. However, the wishes of the people of Laos have not been realized in the past two years. The Geneva Accords have not been fully implemented in Laos. The United States is trying every possible means to drag Laos into the Southeast Asia military bloc, in an attempt to turn Laos into its military base and threaten Laos' independence and sovereignty. It is conceivable that the Lao people are eager to change this situation. This universal desire of the Lao people cannot but be reflected to a certain extent in the Lao National Assembly. The declaration issued by the "Lao People's Salvation League" organized by some parties in the Lao National Assembly on March 10 advocated consolidating the country's peace and independence through a neutral line, and resolving domestic political issues through negotiation and consultation. The fact that Prime Minister Phouma proposed to use the five principles and the principle of opposing foreign interference as his governing policy and was approved by the National Assembly is enough to illustrate the trend of the situation in Laos.

    Facts have fully proved that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are only beneficial and not harmful to all countries that adhere to them. These principles have become the common policy of many Asian and African countries. As a result, these countries have grasped their own destiny, made contributions to peace, improved their international status, and gained more friends; their national economies have also had the opportunity for independent development. Now, even the most powerful colonialist country, the United States, does not dare to use the old methods to oppress these countries in Asia and Africa completely. Recently, Cambodian Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia, announced that he would pursue the Five Principles and a neutral policy, which immediately received widespread support in the country and caused a major response in various countries around the world, enhancing the international reputation of the Kingdom of Cambodia. This is the most obvious example. If the new cabinet of the Kingdom of Laos can implement the policies supported by the Lao National Assembly in action, and resolutely resolve domestic political issues through negotiation and consultation, and fully implement the Geneva Accords, then there is no reason to say that Laos cannot obtain the benefits that Cambodia has already obtained. Doing so will also contribute to peace in Indochina and Asia.

    We welcome the establishment of the new cabinet of the Kingdom of Laos and its announced foreign policy. The Chinese people have always resolutely adhered to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and are willing to develop friendly relations with the people of all countries, especially with the people of their neighboring countries. We will never underestimate the goodwill of any neighboring country.

### 老挝王国组成新内阁

    老挝王国组成新内阁
    延续了一个多月的老挝王国内阁危机，在三月二十一日得到了解决。老挝国民议会通过了以梭发那·富马为首相的老挝王国新内阁。
    在国民议会投信任票以前，富马首相曾向国民议会再一次介绍了他的政府的政策。他说，他的政府将实行五项原则，反对外国对老挝的干涉，并且同各国、特别是同各邻国建立外交关系。
    这次老挝王国内阁危机之所以很久不得解决，是因为国民议会中各党派在国家的政策的一些基本问题上存在着意见分歧。从二月十四日老挝克特内阁辞职以后，前首相克特曾经两次受命组阁，富马和萨纳尼空也曾分别受命组阁，但是在国民议会中都没有得到法定的多数而失败。经过多次反复折冲，国民议会终于对提出实行五项原则的富马首相投了信任票，这绝不是偶然的事。
    1954年印度支那停战以后，老挝人民获得了和平。他们满心希望老挝从此走上独立发展的道路，建设自己的国家。可是两年来老挝人民的这种愿望并没有达到。日内瓦协议在老挝还没有全部实施。美国正在千方百计地企图把老挝拖进东南亚军事集团，想借此把老挝变成它的军事基地，威胁老挝的独立和主权。老挝人民迫切要求改变这种状况，是可想而知的。老挝人民这种普遍的愿望，不能不在老挝国民议会中得到一定程度的反映。老挝国民议会中一些党派所组织的“老挝民众救国联盟”三月十日发表的声明，就主张以中立路线来巩固国家的和平和独立，以谈判协商的方式来解决国内政治问题。这次富马首相提出以五项原则和反对外国干涉等原则作为施政方针而得到国民议会的赞同足以说明老挝局势的趋向。
    事实已经完全证明，和平共处五项原则对所有奉行它的国家只有好处，没有坏处。这些原则已经成了许多亚非国家的共同政策。这些国家由此就掌握了自己的命运，作出了对和平的贡献，提高了自己的国际地位，得到了更多的朋友；它们的民族经济也有了独立发展的机会。现在，就是最强大的殖民主义国家美国，对亚非地区的这些国家也不敢完全用老一套的办法来进行欺压。最近柬埔寨王国首相西哈努克亲王宣布奉行五项原则和中立政策，立即在国内得到广泛的支持，在世界各国引起了重大的反响，提高了柬埔寨王国的国际声望。这是最明显的例证。如果老挝王国新内阁能够在行动中贯彻执行老挝国民议会投票支持的政策，并且坚决以谈判协商的方式解决国内政治问题，完全实施日内瓦协议，那么，就没有理由说柬埔寨已经得到的利益老挝不能得到。这样做，也将对印度支那和亚洲的和平作出贡献。
    我们欢迎老挝王国新内阁的成立和它所宣布的对外政策。中国人民一向坚决奉行和平共处的五项原则，愿意同一切国家人民、特别是同自己的邻国人民发展友好关系。我们对于任何邻国的善意是决不会加以轻视的。
