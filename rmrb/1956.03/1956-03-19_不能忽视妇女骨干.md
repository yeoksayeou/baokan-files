    Women Backbone Must Not Be Ignored

    Since last winter, in the process of small agricultural production cooperatives merging into large ones and elementary cooperatives upgrading to advanced ones in various parts of Hebei Province, most of the original women leaders in the cooperatives have been squeezed out. Currently, many counties in Hebei Province do not even have a single female cooperative director. In the Baoding Special District, the number of female cooperative directors has dropped from the original 173 to only 3; the proportion of women on the cooperative management committee has also been greatly reduced. According to statistics from Mancheng County in this special district, female members of the cooperative management committee account for only slightly more than 7% of the total.

    Why has this phenomenon occurred? The main reason is that some rural cadres still have the idea of ​​underestimating women. They believe that the female leaders in the cooperatives have poor working abilities and cannot handle affairs. In fact, many of the women backbone who have been squeezed out are capable, and even if some are less capable, they can be cultivated. It should be understood that half of the cooperative members are women. To lead these female members to carry out production well, it is necessary to cultivate and equip a certain number of women backbone. Because some special problems of women participating in collective production are not easily noticed by male cadres.

    不能忽视妇女骨干
    从去年冬天以来，河北省各地的农业生产合作社在小社并大社、初级社升高级社的过程中，把原来社里的妇女领导骨干大都挤掉了。目前，河北省许多县的农业合作社连一个女社长也没有了。保定专区原来有173个女社长，现在只剩下了3人；社务委员中，妇女所占的比例也较前大大减少了。根据这个专区满城县的统计：女社务委员仅占社务委员总数的7％稍多一点。
    为什么会发生这样一种现象呢？主要是还有一些农村干部有轻视妇女的思想。他们认为社里的妇女领导骨干工作能力差，不会办事。事实上，许多被挤掉的妇女骨干是有能力的，即便有些能力差一些，但是也是可以培养的。应该了解，合作社里有一半是女社员。要领导这些女社员很好地进行生产，就必须培养和配备一定数量的妇女骨干。因为妇女在参加集体生产中的一些特殊问题，是男干部不容易注意到的。
