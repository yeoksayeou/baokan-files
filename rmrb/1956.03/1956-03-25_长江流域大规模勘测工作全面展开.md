    A large-scale surveying and mapping work is fully underway in the Yangtze River Basin.

    The desolate mountains and dangerous rapids, rarely visited by people for a long time, are now teeming with survey personnel. In the larger water conservancy hub areas of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, more than a thousand surveyors have gathered and, after more than three months of intensive work, have completed the topographic and geological surveys of the dam areas in these regions. They are now beginning surveying and drilling work in the dam site and reservoir areas.

    Preliminary geological exploration and topographic surveys of the famous Three Gorges area of the Yangtze River were completed in November of last year. Now, the exploration personnel are concentrated in several possible dam construction areas, conducting drilling and supplementary surveys.

    After the completion of the planning stage survey and mapping work in the Han River Basin, a tributary of the Yangtze River, a large number of survey personnel are collecting various data required for the preliminary design of the Danjiangkou Reservoir, the first phase of the Han River development project. Along the Yuan River, Zi River, and other rivers in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, survey personnel often wade through icy mountain streams and walk along steep and narrow paths winding around the mountainsides, collecting hydrological, geological, topographic, and socio-economic data for the management of these rivers.

    This intense surveying and mapping work in the Yangtze River Basin mainly aims to further understand the geological, topographic, and other conditions of several areas on the Yangtze River and its main tributaries that may become larger water conservancy and hydropower hubs, in order to facilitate the compilation of the "Outline Report on the Yangtze River Basin Plan" and the research and comparison during the planning of the Yuan River and Zi River basins.

### 长江流域大规模勘测工作全面展开

    长江流域大规模勘测工作全面展开
    一个规模巨大的勘测工作，正在长江流域全面展开。
    许久以来，很少有人到过的荒山峻岭，急流险滩，目前都有一批批的勘测人员在活跃着。长江上游较大的水利枢纽地区，聚结了一千多名勘测人员，经过三个多月紧张的劳动，已经结束了这些地区的坝区的地形测量和地质测量，现在正开始坝址和水库区的测量和钻探工作。
    著名的长江三峡地区的初步地质勘探和地形测量，已在去年十一月间结束。现在，勘探人员正集中在几个可能筑坝的地区，进行钻探和补测。
    长江的支流——汉水流域规划阶段的勘测工作结束后，大批的勘测人员正在为开发汉水的第一期工程丹江口水库，搜集初步设计所需的各种资料。长江中游沅水、资水及其他河流两岸，勘测人员常常趟过冰冷的山溪，走过蜿蜒在山腰中又陡又窄的小道，搜集治理这些河流的水文、地质、地形和社会经济等资料。
    这个紧张进行着的长江流域勘测工作，主要是对长江及其主要支流上的几个可能成为较大的水利、水力枢纽的地区，进一步了解它们的地质、地形等条件，以便于编写“长江流域规划要点报告”和规划沅水、资水流域时的研究比较。（据新华社讯）
