    Three Outstanding Engineers Elected as Model Workers
    Li Dechun, a coal mining engineer, Zhang Tianbao, a coal mining engineer, and Meng Xianzhang, an electromechanical engineer, from the Pingxiang Coal Mine, were awarded the title of Model Worker at the mine's advanced producer representative conference on the 7th.
    All three of them were admitted to the Chinese Communist Party in 1954. Li Dechun is the chief engineer of the Qingshan Mine. He put forward three major rationalization proposals for the district layout of the newly built Qingshan Mine's "May 1st" adit, the location of the No. 2 ventilation shaft, and the tunnel development project. After their implementation, not only was the construction speed accelerated and the transportation system simplified, but also 200,000 tons of coal were added to the state's production, saving 100,000 yuan in investment.
    Electromechanical engineer Meng Xianzhang, over the past year, has successfully trial-produced six automated electric chutes with workers, which have been successfully tested underground at the Gaokeng Mine. Meng Xianzhang also actively helps workers improve their technical skills.
    Zhang Tianbao, chief engineer of the Wangjiayuan Mine, has successfully worked with the workers to study the use of bamboo instead of wood to make the canopies for underground tunneling supports and the roofs of the mining faces over the past year. Now, the Pingxiang Mining Bureau has decided to promote this experience universally.

    三名优秀工程师当选劳动模范
    萍乡煤矿采煤工程师李德纯、张天保和机电工程师孟宪章，7日在全矿先进生产者代表大会上获得劳动模范的称号。
    他们3人都是在1954年被陆续吸收参加中国共产党的。李德纯是青山矿的总工程师。他对新建青山矿“五一”平洞的采区布置、二号风井位置和巷道开拓等工程，提出的3项修改原设计的重大合理化建议实现以后，不仅加快了建设速度，简化了运输系统，还为国家增产20万吨煤炭，节约10万元投资。
    机电工程师孟宪章，一年来和职工们共同试制的6台自动化电溜子，已经在高坑矿井下试验成功。孟宪章还主动地帮助工人提高技术水平。
    王家源矿总工程师张天保，一年来和工人们一起研究用竹子代替木料，做井下掘进壋头的棚子和回采工作面的顶子获得成功。现在，萍乡矿务局已经决定普遍推广这一经验。
