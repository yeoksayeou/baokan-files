Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 12th. A route for diverting the Han River into the Yellow River and the Huai River has been found by a group of surveyors dispatched by the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission.

    This route starts from the Danjiangkou Reservoir on the Han River, which is planned to be built, and diverts water northeastward, flowing through Nanyang, Fangcheng, Jia County, Yu County, and Xinzheng in Henan Province. It crosses 8 undulating hills and cuts across dozens of rivers, then flows into the Yellow River at Taohuayu near Zhengzhou, with a total length of about 466 kilometers. Due to this discovery, the Yangtze (Changjiang), Huai (Huai River), Yellow (Huang He), and Han (Han River) rivers may be connected in the future. Tens of millions of mu of land lacking water on both sides of the Yellow River and the Huai River will receive sufficient water, and a large amount of grain can be produced every year. At the same time, this route can also serve as the basis for improving the North-South Grand Canal. Ships can travel freely from Tianjin in the north to Guangzhou in the south.

    After preliminary water conservancy planning, the water volume of the Yellow River and the Huai River is far from sufficient. Surveyors from the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission began searching for water diversion routes in 1953. They found three routes successively. The other two routes require crossing the Qinling Mountains or the Funiu Mountains, which involves arduous engineering and complex technology. Only the current route is convenient for construction and has great economic value. According to the surveyors, there is a gap in the watershed between the Han River and the Huai River near Fangcheng, which is 148 meters high. The water level of the Yellow River in Zhengzhou is generally 95 meters, while the normal water level of the Danjiangkou Reservoir on the Han River after completion will be maintained above 150 meters. Therefore, the Han River can flow smoothly into the Yellow River and the Huai River along the future artificial channel.

### 汉水将被引入黄河和淮河

    汉水将被引入黄河和淮河
    新华社武汉12日电　把汉水引到黄河和淮河的路线，已经被长江水利委员会派出的一批查勘人员找到了。
    这条路线是从准备修建的汉水丹江口水库引水向东北，流经河南省的南阳、方城、郏县、禹县、新郑等地，穿过8处起伏的丘陵，横切数十条河流，然后在郑州附近的桃花峪流入黄河，全长约466公里。由于这一发现，江（长江）、淮（淮河）、河（黄河）、汉（汉水）将来有可能贯通起来。黄河和淮河两岸缺水的几千万亩土地，将得到充足的水量，每年可以增产大量的粮食。同时，这条路线还可以作为改进南北大运河的基础。北起天津，南到广州，轮船可以自由往来。
    黄河和淮河经过初步水利规划，水量大感不足。长江水利委员会的查勘人员从1953年起就开始寻找引水路线。他们先后找到了3条路线。其他两条路线要穿过秦岭或伏牛山，工程艰巨，技术复杂。只有现在的这条路线施工方便，经济价值又大。据查勘人员谈：方城附近汉水和淮河的分水岭恰巧有一个缺口，高148公尺。郑州黄河水位一般是95公尺，而汉水丹江口水库建成以后的经常水位将维持在150公尺以上，因此汉水可以沿着未来的人工渠道顺畅地流到黄河和淮河。
