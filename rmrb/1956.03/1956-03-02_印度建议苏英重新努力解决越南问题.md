Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 29th – According to a report from the Indian Press Trust: Indian Prime Minister Nehru said on February 29th in the People's House, in response to a question, that India has suggested to Britain and the Soviet Union that they make further efforts to resolve the difficult problems in Vietnam.

When a member of parliament asked about the implementation of the Geneva Accords, Nehru said that the main problem is that Ngo Dinh Diem has not accepted the Geneva Accords at all, therefore he does not consider himself bound by the provisions of the accords. Nehru also said that although the South Vietnamese government has benefited greatly from the Geneva Accords, Ngo Dinh Diem still does not fulfill the responsibilities and obligations stipulated by the accords. Nehru said that, therefore, the first thing that needs to be resolved now is that people have an obligation to respect the Geneva Accords and implement them.

    印度建议苏英重新努力解决越南问题
    新华社新德里29日电　据印度报业托辣斯消息：印度总理尼赫鲁2月29日在人民院答复问题时说，印度已经向英国和苏联提出建议，请它们再作努力来解决越南的困难问题。
    当有议员问到日内瓦协定的执行情况时，尼赫鲁说，主要问题是吴庭艳根本没有接受日内瓦协定，因此他不认为他自己是受协定的规定所约束的。尼赫鲁还说，虽然南越政府由于日内瓦协定而得到许多好处，但是，吴庭艳还是不履行协定所规定的责任和义务。尼赫鲁说，因此，现在首先需要解决的事就是，人们有义务尊重日内瓦协定，并且实现这个协定。
