Xinhua News Agency, March 30th, New York Dispatch: U.S. Communist Party General Secretary Dennis announced on the 28th that the U.S. Communist Party will ask the court to revoke the measures taken by U.S. government officials to seal up the headquarters and offices of the U.S. Communist Party and the "Daily Worker" newspaper office in New York. He pointed out that the real motive for this measure is to intimidate the opposition on the eve of the presidential election and to create an atmosphere of terror at home.

    Despite the U.S. government's sealing of the newspaper office, the "Daily Worker" continued to be published on the 28th and 29th. The newspaper published an editorial on the 28th entitled "A Dark Day for Free Press," saying: "McCarthyism has been abandoned by the American people, but the Eisenhower administration yesterday (27th) took an action that only a McCarthyite who despises the Bill of Rights could do, brazenly disregarding the freedom of speech and publication guaranteed by this sacred document." The newspaper published a three-column summary of the Bill of Rights under the title: "Bill of Rights – Don't Let Them Throw It Aside."

    The U.S. Communist Party's lawyers have been in contact with U.S. government officials to request the return of the U.S. Communist Party headquarters and offices and the "Daily Worker" newspaper office, which were sealed up on the 27th. However, a representative of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service stated on the 29th that he refused.

    On the 28th, the U.S. Communist Party had already organized a "News Freedom Emergency Committee" dedicated to working to regain the "Daily Worker" newspaper office.

    Pollitt Issues Statement
    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 30th: London's "Daily Worker" published a statement by British Communist Party General Secretary Pollitt on the 29th, protesting the U.S. government's search and seizure of the New York "Daily Worker" newspaper office and the national headquarters and local offices of the U.S. Communist Party.

    The statement said that despite seven years of continuous political persecution and imprisonment of the leaders of the Communist Party, the U.S. Communist Party has shown that it cannot be destroyed, and its ideas cannot be imprisoned. In fact, the very ideas that have led to the persecution of the Communist Party have now become the ideas of millions of Americans.

    The statement said that the latest attack, launched under the weak and transparent pretext of taxation, is clearly to mask a new McCarthyist attack on freedom of the press. We believe that the voice of the American "Daily Worker" cannot be stifled, and these new attacks will be defeated by the growing democratic forces in the United States.

    The statement called on the U.S. government to end this Gestapo-style search and restore the freedom of the American "Daily Worker" and the American Communist Party.

    抗议美国当局新的麦卡锡式的进攻
    美国共产党坚持斗争
    新华社30日讯　纽约消息：美国共产党总书记丹尼斯在二十八日宣布，美国共产党将要求法院撤销美国政府官员查封美国共产党总部及办事处和纽约“工人日报”报社的措施。他指出，这种措施的真正动机是在总统竞选的前夕恫吓反对派，并且在国内制造恐怖气氛。
    尽管美国政府查封了报社，“工人日报”二十八日和二十九日继续出版。报纸在二十八日以“自由新闻的黑暗的一天”为题发表社论说：“麦卡锡主义已经被美国人民抛弃了，但是艾森豪威尔政府昨天（二十七日）却采取了只有一个藐视权利法案的麦卡锡分子才能做出来的行动，悍然不顾这个神圣的文件所保证的言论出版自由。”报纸以三栏的篇幅摘要刊载了权利法案，标题是：“权利法案——不要让他们把它抛到一边去”。
    美国共产党的律师已经同美国政府官员进行交涉，要求交还二十七日被查封的美国共产党总部及办事处和“工人日报”报社。但是，美国国内税务局代表在二十九日表示拒绝。
    二十八日，美国共产党已经组织了“新闻自由非常委员会”，专门为争取收回“工人日报”报社而努力。
    波立特发表声明
    新华社柏林30日电　伦敦“工人日报”二十九日刊载了英国共产党总书记波立特的声明，抗议美国政府搜查并查封纽约“工人日报”报社以及美国共产党全国总部和地方的办公处。
    声明说，尽管对共产党的领袖们进行了七年继续不断的政治迫害和监禁，美国共产党已经表明它是摧毁不了的，它的思想是监禁不住的。实际上，使得共产党受到迫害的这种思想现在已经成为千百万美国人民的思想。
    声明说，在软弱无力和显而易见的收税的借口下发动的最新的进攻，显然是为了掩饰对新闻自由的新的麦卡锡式的进攻。我们相信，美国“工人日报”的声音是窒息不了的，这些新的进攻将被日益增长的美国民主力量所击败。
    声明要求美国政府结束这种盖世太保式的搜查，并且恢复美国“工人日报”和美国共产党的自由。
