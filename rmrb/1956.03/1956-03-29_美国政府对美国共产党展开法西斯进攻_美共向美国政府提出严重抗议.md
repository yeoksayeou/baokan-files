Xinhua News Agency, March 28th, New York Dispatch: The United States government launched a full-scale fascist attack on the American Communist Party on March 27th.

    On this day, the US government mobilized a large number of personnel to simultaneously take large-scale actions from the West Coast to the East Coast, sealing off the national headquarters of the American Communist Party in New York and the district offices in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Chicago, Detroit, and Newark. It also sealed off the offices of the New York "Daily Worker," edited by the American Communist Party for thirty-two years, and its offices in Chicago and Detroit. Illegal searches were conducted before the sealing.

    To conceal the fascist nature of this action, the American authorities fabricated extremely ridiculous excuses, insisting that the American Communist Party and the "Daily Worker" owed government taxes as the reason for the seizure. Agence France-Presse revealed the true conspiracy of the American authorities in a telegram from New York on the 27th. It said: Government officials often talk about declaring the Communist Party illegal, and "today's seizure is the first concrete action in this regard."

    According to news from the US news agency, on the 27th, US Treasury Department tax personnel were ordered to carry out the seizure order at the same time. These personnel rudely locked the doors of the American Communist Party headquarters in New York, confiscated many archives and books preserved by the American Communist Party, and also confiscated the American Communist Party's bank deposit books, real estate, and all other assets of the American Communist Party from New York to San Francisco, and threatened to auction off all these assets. Before the American officials enforcing the seizure order forcibly closed the newspaper office, the staff of the "Daily Worker" refused to leave their offices and held a four-hour sit-down strike, finally leaving the office only under the threat of police violence. Alan Max, editor-in-chief of the "Daily Worker," said that despite the US government's brutal persecution, the "Daily Worker" will persist in continuing publication.

    The American Communist Party lodged a serious protest against this fascist persecution by the US government. On the 27th, Dennis, the General Secretary of the American Communist Party, sent a protest telegram to US President Eisenhower, which stated that the American Communist Party "strongly protests the Gestapo-style attack by Treasury Department personnel on the Communist Party headquarters and the 'Daily Worker'. The act of closing newspapers and political headquarters on the despicable pretext of paying taxes is nothing but a thorough McCarthy-style political persecution." The telegram pointed out that this is "a violation of all American principles such as freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of assembly and association," and is "an illegal attempt to use police force to silence political opposition." The telegram demanded the revocation of the seizure order and the removal of the officials responsible for this illegal action.

    On the evening of the 27th, the New York "Daily Worker" was published as usual. The newspaper announced the incident of the Treasury Department's seizure of the "Daily Worker" and the American Communist Party's offices with a full-page headline. The newspaper published a lengthy editorial and Dennis's protest telegram to Eisenhower. It also published a photograph of a portion of the Bill of Rights.

Xinhua News Agency, March 28th, New York Dispatch: The US authorities are stepping up the persecution of American Communist Party leaders. On March 26, the Federal Court in Foley Square, New York, sentenced Green and Winston, members of the National Committee of the American Communist Party, to an additional three years in prison because Green and Winston did not serve the five-year prison sentence imposed by the US court under the infamous Smith Act in 1951. Green and Winston are currently imprisoned.

    The US court recently also declared Bloom Bloom-berg, the National Legislative Issues Committee of the American Communist Party, "guilty" for violating the Smith Act, and interrogated Leifert, an alternate member of the National Committee of the American Communist Party, Scals, chairman of the Communist Party Committee of North and South Carolina, and fourteen local leaders of the Communist Party in California.

    美国政府对美国共产党展开法西斯进攻
    美共向美国政府提出严重抗议
    新华社28日讯　纽约消息：美国政府在三月二十七日对美国共产党展开了全面的法西斯进攻。
    在这一天，美国政府出动大批人员，从西海岸直到东海岸同时采取大规模行动，查封了在纽约的美国共产党全国总部和在旧金山、洛杉矶、费城、芝加哥、底特律和纽瓦克的分区办公处，同时也查封了已经有三十二年历史的美国共产党主编的纽约“工人日报”的报社和它在芝加哥、底特律的办事处。在查封以前并且进行了非法的搜查。
    美国当局为了掩饰这次行动的法西斯性质，制造了极其可笑的借口，硬说美国共产党和“工人日报”拖欠了政府税款，作为查封的理由。法新社在二十七日从纽约发出的电讯中透露了美国当局的真正阴谋。它说：政府人士常常谈到宣布共产党非法，“今天的查封行动是在这方面的第一个具体的行动”。
    据美国通讯社消息，二十七日，美国财政部税务人员奉命在同一时间内出动执行查封的命令。这些人员粗暴地锁上了在纽约的美国共产党总部的大门，没收了美国共产党所保存的许多档案、书籍，另外还没收了美国共产党的银行存款折、不动产和美国共产党从纽约到旧金山的所有其他资产，并且扬言要把这些资产全部拍卖。在执行查封命令的美国官员强行封闭报社以前，“工人日报”的工作人员拒绝离开他们的办公室，他们举行了四小时的静坐罢工，最后只是在警察的暴力威胁下才撤离办公室。“工人日报”编辑主任阿兰·马克斯表示，尽管有美国政府的横暴迫害，“工人日报”仍然将坚持继续出版。
    美国共产党对美国政府这种法西斯迫害行为，提出了严重的抗议。美国共产党总书记丹尼斯二十七日拍给美国总统艾森豪威尔一封抗议电报，这封电报说：美国共产党“强硬抗议财政部人员对共产党各总部和‘工人日报’进行盖世太保式的袭击。以付税的卑鄙借口来封闭报馆和各政治总部的行为不是别的，而是彻头彻尾的麦卡锡式的政治迫害。”电报指出，这是对“言论自由、出版自由和集会结社自由等所有美国原则的侵犯”，是“用警察力量堵住政治上的反对派的嘴巴的非法企图”。电报要求撤销查封的命令，并且把应对这次非法行动负责的官员撤职。
    二十七日晚间，纽约“工人日报”照常出版。报纸以横贯全页的头号大标题宣布财政部人员查封“工人日报”和美国共产党办公处的事件。报纸发表了长篇的社论和丹尼斯给艾森豪威尔的抗议电报。同时还刊登了宪法权利法案一部分的照片。
    新华社28日讯　纽约消息：美国当局正在加紧迫害美国共产党领袖。三月二十六日，纽约福莱广场联邦法院加判了美国共产党全国委员会委员格林和温斯顿三年徒刑，因为1951年格林和温斯顿没有去服美国法院根据臭名昭彰的史密斯法判处的五年徒刑。格林和温斯顿目前已经被关进了监狱。
    美国法院最近还以违反史密斯法为理由宣判美国共产党全国立法问题委员布鲁姆贝格“有罪”，并且审讯了美国共产党全国委员会候补委员莱弗特、南、北卡罗来纳州共产党委员会主席斯卡尔斯以及加利福尼亚州十四名共产党的地方领袖。
