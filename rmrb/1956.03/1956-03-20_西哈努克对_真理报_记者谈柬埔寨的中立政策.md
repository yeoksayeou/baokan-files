Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th (TASS): "Pravda's" Phnom Penh correspondent, Grishchenko, reported on his conversation with Cambodian Prime Minister Sihanouk. In the conversation, Sihanouk said: We are taking our own path, and we hope to consolidate peace and seek happiness for all the people of our country. In 1953, the French granted us independence, but it was far from complete. We continued to fight and achieved liberation. France understood that it was no longer possible to maintain the colonial system. Now, we have established a friendly and equal relationship with the French, and we harbor no animosity towards France.

Sihanouk analyzed the foreign policy currently pursued by the Cambodian government and said: We adhere to a strict and absolute policy of neutrality. We advocate establishing friendly relations with the people of all countries. We are unwilling to participate in any bloc. For example, Cambodia resolutely refuses to join the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. The Americans had to agree to this, but they insisted that we are still under the "protection" of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. But we do not want such "protection" because we are not threatened by anyone. We hope to live a peaceful life. Sihanouk pointed out, while introducing the policies of the Royal Government of Cambodia, that the Royal Government hopes to adjust relations with all neighboring countries, especially with South Vietnam and Thailand. Prime Minister Sihanouk spoke with great excitement about his recent visit to the People's Republic of China.

He said that China fully understands our position. Throughout the visit to China, we have always felt the sincere friendship and sympathy of the government and all the Chinese people towards our delegation and all the Cambodian people. We will strive to strengthen the friendly relations between our two countries. For example, we intend to arrange normal trade relations with China.

As the conversation was coming to an end, Sihanouk talked about the prospects of Cambodia's relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. Sihanouk emphasized that we advocate establishing normal diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, and then we can start arranging trade relations based on equality and mutual benefit, as well as cultural exchanges.

    西哈努克对“真理报”记者谈柬埔寨的中立政策
    新华社据塔斯社莫斯科19日讯　“真理报”驻金边特派记者格里希钦科报道了他同柬埔寨首相西哈努克进行的谈话。西哈努克在谈话中说：我们走自己的路，我们希望巩固和平和为我国全体人民谋求幸福。在一九五三年，法国人给予了我们独立，但是远非完全的独立。我们继续进行斗争，并且取得了解放。法国了解到，保持殖民制度是再也不可能了。现在，我们和法国人之间建立了友好平等的关系，我们对法国并没有抱任何敌意。
    西哈努克分析了柬埔寨政府现在奉行的外交政策，并且说：我们遵守严格和绝对中立的政策。我们主张同一切国家的人民建立友好的关系。我们不愿意参加任何集团。例如，柬埔寨坚决拒绝加入东南亚条约组织。美国人不得不同意这一点，但是他们又硬说，我们还是受东南亚条约组织的“保护”。但是我们不希望受这种“保护”，因为我们没有受到任何人的威胁。我们希望过和平的生活。西哈努克在接着介绍柬埔寨王国政府的政策的时候指出，王国政府希望调整同所有邻国、特别是同南越和泰国的关系。西哈努克首相极其兴奋地谈了不久前访问中华人民共和国的情况。
    他说，中国完全了解我们的立场。在访问中国的整个期间，我们一直感觉到政府和全体中国人民对我国代表团和全体柬埔寨人民的真挚友谊和同情。我们将努力加强我们两国的友好关系。譬如，我们打算同中国安排正常的贸易关系。
    在谈话快要结束的时候，西哈努克谈到了柬埔寨同苏联以及人民民主国家之间的关系的前景问题。西哈努克着重指出，我们主张同苏联和人民民主国家建立正常的外交关系，然后就可以着手安排以平等互利为基础的贸易关系以及文化交流。
