    The First Automobile Works already has sixteen units of engineering and technical personnel who are employing the "chain method" of talent cultivation, proposed by engineer Cao Cunchang, to train apprentices. In the gearbox workshop, 80% of the engineering and technical personnel are organized to study and research technology. Young technicians and adjusters have a very high enthusiasm for learning and are determined to quickly master new technologies under the guidance of experienced masters to ensure the early production of automobiles. Engineer Cao Cunchang recently formed a gear research group consisting of young people engaged in gear manufacturing and design throughout the factory, to study gear manufacturing technology.

    Some engineers at the Fengman Power Plant in Jilin Province, the Changchun Pharmaceutical Factory, and the Changchun Metrology Factory have also begun to use the chain method to cultivate technical talent. (Our correspondent in Changchun)

    用连锁法培养技术人材
    第一汽车制造厂已经有十六个单位的工程技术人员，采用工程师曹存昌提出的用连锁法培养人材的方法，培养徒弟。变速箱车间有80％的工程技术人员组织起来，学习和研究技术。年轻的技术员和调整工学习情绪很高，都决心要在老师傅的教导下，赶快掌握新技术，保证提前出产汽车。曹存昌工程师最近已把全厂从事齿轮制造和设计工作的年轻人，组成齿轮研究小组，钻研齿轮制造技术。
    吉林省丰满发电厂、长春化学制药厂和长春度量衡工厂的一些工程师也已经开始采用连锁法培养技术人材。　（本报驻长春记者）
