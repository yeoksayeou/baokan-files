Not Only Quantity, But Also Quality
    In the advanced producer movement, the Harbin Linen Textile Factory seized the key to increasing production by overseeing more machines, and rapidly increased labor productivity. However, the product quality declined. Last December, the first-class product rate of the wet spinning workshop was 68%, which dropped to 62% in January this year, and 66.4% in February. The product quality of the weaving workshop in January and February this year was also inferior to that of last December.
    The purpose of carrying out the advanced producer movement is to attract more activists from the masses to lead everyone to complete the country's production and construction tasks faster, more, better, and more economically. However, the leaders of the Harbin Linen Textile Factory used one-sided thinking to guide this movement, which can only lead the masses astray and cannot bring benefits to the country.
    Not only should the quantity be large, but especially the quality should be good. This is a problem that all enterprises should pay urgent attention to.

    不仅要多而且要好
    哈尔滨亚麻纺织工厂在开展先进生产者运动中，抓住了多看机台的增产关键，迅速提高了劳动生产率。但是，产品质量下降了。去年十二月，湿纺车间的一等品是68％，今年一月降到62％，二月份是66.4％。织布场今年一、二月份的产品质量也不如去年十二月。
    开展先进生产者运动，就是为了从群众中吸引更多的积极分子来带领大家更快更多更好更省地完成国家的生产和建设任务。但是，哈尔滨亚麻纺织工厂的领导者用片面的思想来指导这个运动，这只能把群众引到歧路上去，而不能给国家带来利益。
    不仅数量上要多特别是质量上要好，这是所有企业都应当迫切注意的问题。
