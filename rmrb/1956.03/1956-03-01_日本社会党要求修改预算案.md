Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 29th. The Japanese House of Representatives discussed the government's proposed budget for the 1956 fiscal year on February 28th. The Socialist Party demanded that the Japanese government revise this budget and put forward specific revision proposals.

    Socialist Party member Teiji Ikeda pointed out in the discussion that a large portion of the increased budget expenditure was allocated to rearmament, making the people's lives extremely unstable. He condemned the Japanese government and the Liberal Democratic Party for disregarding Japan's economic situation in terms of rearmament and completely listening to the opinions of the United States. Ikeda also accused the Japanese government of increasing the tax burden on the working people in the budget. He said that in the tax system, "it is very generous to the upper-class citizens and very harsh to the lower-class citizens."

    According to the budget revision plan proposed by the Socialist Party, direct military expenditure would be reduced by more than 70 billion yen compared to the Japanese government's original plan, and income tax would be reduced by more than 35 billion yen. The Socialist Party's plan also stipulates raising the salaries of public officials and increasing the prices at which the government purchases rice from farmers.

    However, the Liberal Democratic Party, relying on its majority in the House of Representatives, passed the government's budget案 intact. Currently, the Japanese government's budget案 has been submitted to the House of Councillors for deliberation.

    日本社会党要求修改预算案
    新华社29日讯　东京消息：日本国会众议院在2月28日讨论政府制定的1956年度预算案。社会党要求日本政府修改这个预算案，并且提出了具体的修改方案。
    社会党议员池田祯治在讨论中指出，日本政府的预算支出中的增加部分，有一大半拨到重整军备方面，使国民生活极不安定。他谴责日本政府和自由民主党在重整军备方面不顾日本经济情况，而完全听从美国的意见。池田祯治还指责日本政府在预算中增加劳动人民的捐税负担。他说，在税制中“对上层国民很宽厚，对下层国民很刻薄。”
    根据社会党提出的预算修改方案，直接军费比日本政府的原案减少700多亿日元；所得税减少350多亿日元。社会党的方案还规定提高公务人员的工资；并且提高政府征购农民的大米的价格。
    但是，自由民主党凭恃它在众议院中的多数，使众议院原封不动地通过了政府的预算案。目前，日本政府的预算案已经提交参议院审议。
