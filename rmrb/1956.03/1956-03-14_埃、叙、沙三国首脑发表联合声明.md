Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 13th: Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser, Syrian President al-Quwatli, and Saudi Arabian King Saud bin Abdulaziz concluded their six-day meeting in Cairo on March 11 and issued a joint statement on March 12.

The joint statement said: "We reviewed all aspects of the Middle East situation. We unanimously agreed to work for peace. The realization and maintenance of peace can only be built on the basis of sincere cooperation among countries in accordance with the United Nations Charter." The joint statement also stated that the three heads of state "are determined to protect the Arab world from the poison of the Cold War, but rather to keep the Arab world out of the various currents of the Cold War and adopt an impartial policy towards international conflicts."

The three heads of state announced that "the defense of the Arab world should be based on the security needs of the Arab world itself, out of the wishes of the Arab countries, and should not be related to any foreign treaties. These treaties serve the interests of the great powers by sacrificing the interests and wishes of the Arab countries and undermining the unity of the Arab countries."

The joint statement reiterated the three countries' support for the principles proclaimed by the Bandung Asian-African Conference and stated that these principles are a milestone guiding the three countries' policies in international affairs.

The joint statement said that Zionist aggression and foreign rule have caused tension and are a threat to the Middle East. The joint statement said that an agreement has been reached on coordinating Arab national defense plans.

The joint statement said, "A comprehensive plan has been drawn up to counter attempts to endanger Arab security and divide the Arab common front by putting pressure on Arab countries through the Baghdad Pact." The three heads of state agreed that should Jordan be subjected to foreign pressure, Jordan should be given all possible support and assistance.

The joint statement said that the meeting stipulated a solution to the problems caused by the British occupation of the Buraimi Oasis. The meeting also believed that France's policy of persisting in violating the rights of the people of North Africa greatly threatens peace in that region. France must recognize the right to independence of the people of North Africa in accordance with the United Nations Charter and the principle that the people of all countries have the right to national self-determination.

The joint statement said: "Our will and our spirit have been strengthened by what we have seen with satisfaction, that is, the growth of national consciousness in the Arab countries."

    埃、叙、沙三国首脑发表联合声明
    新华社13日讯　开罗消息：埃及总理纳赛尔、叙利亚总统库阿特利和沙特阿拉伯国王沙特·阿卜杜勒·阿齐兹已经在3月11日结束了他们在开罗举行的历时6天的会议，并且在12日发表了一项联合声明。
    联合声明说：“我们审查了中东形势的各个方面。我们一致认为要为和平而努力。和平的实现和维持只能建立在各国根据联合国宪章进行的真诚合作的基础上。”联合声明又说：三国首脑“决心保障阿拉伯世界不受冷战的毒害，而是使阿拉伯世界置身于冷战的各种潮流之外，并且对国际冲突采取一种不偏不倚的政策。”
    三国首脑宣布，“阿拉伯世界的防御应该按照阿拉伯世界自己的安全需要，出于阿拉伯国家的愿望，同一切外国条约不发生关系。这些条约是为牺牲阿拉伯国家利益和愿望并且破坏阿拉伯国家团结的大国自己的利益服务的。”
    联合声明重申三国对万隆亚非会议所宣布的原则的支持，并且说，这些原则是指导三国在国际方面的政策的里程碑。
    联合声明说，犹太复国主义侵略和外国统治已经引起紧张状态，并且是对中东的威胁。联合声明说，会议已经达成了关于协调阿拉伯国家防御计划的协议。
    联合声明说，“已经拟定了一个包括各方面的计划，来反击想通过巴格达条约对阿拉伯国家施加压力从而危及阿拉伯安全和分裂阿拉伯共同阵线的企图。”三国首脑同意，万一约旦受到外国的压力，应该给约旦以一切可能的支持和各种帮助。
    联合声明说，会议规定了解决由于英国占领布赖米绿洲而引起的问题的办法。会议还认为，坚持侵犯北非人民权利的法国政策大大地威胁了那个地区的和平。法国必须遵照联合国宪章和一切国家的人民有民族自决权的原则承认北非人民的独立权利。
    联合声明说：“我们的意志和我们的精神已经随着我们所满意地看到的东西而加强，这就是阿拉伯国家民族意识的增长。”
