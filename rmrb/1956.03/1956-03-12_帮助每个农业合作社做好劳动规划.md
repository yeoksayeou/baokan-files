Editor's Note: Not long ago, the first district committee secretary meeting of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China was held in Beijing to discuss how to rectify and consolidate agricultural production cooperatives after the realization of complete socialist agricultural cooperation in the province. The meeting widely exchanged experiences in the management and operation of agricultural production cooperatives. Of particular note at present are the experiences in formulating labor plans, stipulating work quotas, and leading production teams. What is published here is a portion of the speeches introducing these experiences at the meeting.

Help Each Agricultural Cooperative Make a Good Labor Plan
Cui Tao, Secretary of the Hejian County Committee of the Communist Party of China

The number of farm households in Hejian County, Hebei Province, who have joined the fully socialist agricultural production cooperatives accounts for 99.3% of the total number of farm households in the county. There are 98 cooperatives, with an average of 938 households per cooperative. More than 100,000 small plots of land scattered throughout the county have been connected into more than 1,000 large plots; each cooperative has a labor force of thousands of people. The productive forces have been further liberated. The conservative thinking and piecemeal leadership methods brought about by the small-peasant economy are no longer adapted to the new situation. After the establishment of advanced cooperatives, there are still many urgent problems to be solved in terms of organization and production. The concrete realization of the principle of production and distribution of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work" is an extremely meticulous and complex task. How to properly handle the relationship between the cooperative and its members, how to rationally allocate and use labor, how to improve labor utilization and labor productivity, etc., must still be solved with great effort. In the recent period, the Hejian County Committee has focused on leading the production planning and labor planning work of each cooperative, and has taken this as the first important measure to consolidate and improve agricultural cooperatives and ensure the realization of increased production tasks.

In the past few months, through discussions between the county committee and the cooperatives, a preliminary production plan has been determined. The production increase requirements for 1956 are: to ensure that the yield of grain crops reaches 400 jin per mu, and to strive to reach 650 jin; to ensure that the yield of cotton (lint) reaches 60 jin per mu, and to strive to reach 80 jin; to ensure that the yield of peanuts reaches 350 jin per mu, and to strive to reach 450 jin. In order to achieve the production increase targets, crops must be carefully cultivated, with an average labor input of about 20 per mu, which is twice as much as last year. In order to basically alleviate the threat of waterlogging in more than 600,000 mu of low-lying land this year, more than 700,000 mu of soil embankments and ridges will be built, requiring more than 900,000 labor days. Coupled with soil improvement, increased fertilization, well digging, etc., a total of 40 million labor days will be used in agriculture. Including sideline labor and obligatory labor for building dikes, repairing roads, and flood prevention, the total estimated labor requirement for the year is about 50 million labor days. Correct labor planning based on production needs and the possibility of farmers' work attendance is an extremely important issue to ensure the realization of the production plan.

In what aspects should labor planning be carried out?

First, improve labor utilization. According to surveys, there are large differences in the production attendance rates of different farmers. The general attendance of individual farmers throughout the year is: 110-120 days for male able-bodied laborers and 30 days for female able-bodied laborers. Last year, in primary cooperatives, the attendance of most members was: 170-180 days for male able-bodied laborers, 70-80 days for female able-bodied laborers, and the vast majority of auxiliary laborers were not used. In the same year, the Red Star Cooperative in Dongshijing Village was very different: male able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers averaged 270 days of attendance, with 10% attending 300-324 days, female able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers averaged 230 days of attendance, with 10% attending 280-320 days, and 80% of auxiliary laborers attended 100 days, with some attending more than 200 days. According to these three different situations, a large number of laborers can be added to production throughout the county. At present, the county has 107,176 male laborers (converted to full labor) joining cooperatives, 108,817 female laborers (converted to full labor), and 15,000 auxiliary laborers (converted to full labor). According to the situation of the Red Star Cooperative, it is possible for male able-bodied laborers to work an average of 300 days, female able-bodied laborers to work 200 days, and 80% of auxiliary laborers to work 100 days. In this way, a total of more than 57.11 million labor days can be worked, and even after deducting 5% for contingencies, more than 54.12 million labor days can still be worked. This is more than double the general level of attendance of primary cooperatives last year (more than 24 million labor days).

How to expand attendance?

1.  Conduct education on the glory of labor and carefully calculate accounts to mobilize members to voluntarily report their planned labor input; then, make reasonable adjustments based on the cooperative's labor use plan. In the past, restricted by the backward level of production, there was a false appearance of "labor surplus." Most of those who were absent were women with children, heads of middle-peasant households, and a very small number of lazy people. After the transition to advanced cooperatives, people understood the principle of more work, more gain. After political education and calculating income accounts, the labor enthusiasm of the members can be greatly improved.

After the members voluntarily report their planned labor input, the leaders of the cooperative should also make appropriate arrangements to make the amount of work done by each household reasonable and to make the production tasks and labor force of each team compatible in terms of quantity and strength. Attention should be paid to appropriately arranging work for auxiliary laborers according to their skills and physical strength, allowing them to do fruit tree pruning, livestock breeding, childcare, seed selection, and other work.

2.  Liberating female labor and putting it into production is a remarkable force. The key to mobilizing women is to fight against the feudal remnants of thought that despise women, solve the problem of women taking care of children, and solve the problem of equal pay for equal work between men and women. Last year, the Red Star Cooperative had 586 female laborers, of whom 279 were young and middle-aged laborers with children. Before the spring planting last year, children occupied 123 female able-bodied laborers, 87 semi-able-bodied laborers, and auxiliary laborers, a total of 210 people who could not participate in production. Simple childcare assistance was organized, and small-scale individual custody and rational mutual assistance methods were widely adopted. Some problems of discord between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law and elderly people not taking care of children in some families were also solved, freeing up 101 female laborers to participate in production. Women's participation in production almost took over all 400 mu of pear orchards and 1,000 mu of cotton fields.

Second, improve labor efficiency. After the establishment of advanced cooperatives, the production enthusiasm of the members has indeed greatly improved. However, the general labor efficiency is still not high. The production tasks are huge in the future, and the problem cannot be solved solely by increasing labor intensity. Labor efficiency must be improved in all aspects.

1.  Promoting advanced experience and improving technical level can increase labor efficiency by one to several times. Taking agricultural operations as an example, improving technology on the existing basis is very important before mechanization. The existing agricultural operation techniques are advanced and backward, and the efficiency varies greatly. In general cooperatives, only 20% of male members are proficient in all agricultural work and do it quickly and well; this is even less true among female members. Those who are good at using the new-style walking plow to cultivate land can cultivate six or seven mu a day; those with poor skills can only cultivate three or four mu, and it is also rough. If the backward majority is raised to the advanced level, production efficiency will change significantly. The main methods to improve the technical level are: when reorganizing production teams and groups, appropriately match people according to their technical level to ensure teaching and learning; establish technical schools within the cooperative to impart technology according to seasonal agricultural work.

Summarizing and promoting the advanced experience of the masses is also an effective method to improve labor efficiency. We plan to dig 50,000 brick wells. In addition to using the existing bricks, we also need to burn 130 million bricks. If we build 200 new kilns and burn bricks according to the old method, it will take more than 8 months to complete. The method of 'burning string kilns' was discovered among the masses. If we build 200 new kilns, we can burn them in more than 1 month, which can save more than 100,000 labor days.

2.  Reasonably determining work quotas and doing a good job in contracting work and output are also important measures to improve labor efficiency and ensure work quality. We first came up with a work quota plan and contracting plan in the Red Star Cooperative, and then widely promoted it throughout the county.

Third, strengthen planning. Agricultural production is very time-sensitive, and a mistake in one thing can cause great losses. Last year, after the Grain Rain Festival, the Red Star Cooperative in Shijing Village grasped the secondary agricultural work and planted cotton one day late. As a result, 1,900 mu of cotton reduced the production of 100,000 jin of seed cotton. When formulating labor plans, cooperatives must calculate tasks, labor, and time, find out the base figures, and appropriately match and adjust them according to the tasks and labor situation. The Red Star Cooperative calculated this year and found that there was a shortage of more than 50,000 labor days in agricultural construction, so it reduced 4 kinds of sideline production and reduced the number of collectively raised pigs (each household raised more), freeing up more than 50,000 labor days and allocating them to basic water conservancy construction.

### 帮助每个农业合作社做好劳动规划

    编者按：不久以前在北京召开的中共河北省第一次区委书记会议，讨论了全省实现完全社会主义的农业合作化以后怎样整顿和巩固农业生产合作社的问题。会上广泛地交流了农业生产合作社的经营管理经验。其中特别值得当前注意的是关于制定劳动规划、规定工作定额和领导生产队的经验。这里发表的，就是这次会议上介绍这些经验的一部分发言。
    帮助每个农业合作社做好劳动规划
    中共河间县委书记　崔涛
    河北省河间县加入全社会主义的农业生产合作社的农户已经占全县总农户的99.3％。共有98个社，平均每社938户。全县分散的10多万块小片土地，连成1，000多个大片；每个社都有成千上万的劳动大军。生产力进一步解放了。在小农经济的基础上带来的保守思想和零打碎敲的领导方法已经不能适应新的情况。高级社建成以后，在组织上和生产上还有许多急待解决的问题。具体实现“各尽所能，按劳取酬”的生产和分配原则，是极为细致复杂的工作。如何妥善处理社与社员之间的关系，如何合理支配和使用劳力，如何提高劳动力利用率和劳动生产率等等问题，还必须用极大的努力去解决。河间县委在最近一个时期着重领导了各个社的生产规划和劳动规划工作，把这作为巩固提高农业社和保证实现增产任务的第一个重要措施。
    几个月来，经过县委同各社讨论，初步确定了生产规划。1956年的增产要求是：粮食作物每亩产量保证达到400斤，争取达到650斤；棉花（皮棉）每亩产量保证达到60斤，争取达到80斤；花生每亩产量保证达到350斤，争取达到450斤。为了实现增产指标，对农作物要加工细作，每亩平均用工20个左右，比去年多用一倍。为了今年基本解除60多万亩低洼地的沥涝威胁，搞土埂畦田70多万亩，用工90多万个。加上改良土壤，增施肥料，打井等，共计在农业方面用工4，000万个。再加副业用工及打堤、修路、防汛等义务工在内，全年预计共需用5，000万个工左右。根据生产的需要和农民出工的可能，正确地进行劳动规划，是保证实现生产规划的一个极为重要的问题。
    从哪些方面进行劳动规划呢？
    第一，提高劳动力利用率。据调查，不同农民的生产出勤率差别很大。单干农民全年的一般的出勤情况是：男整劳动力110—120天，女整劳动力30天。去年，在初级社里，大部分社的社员出勤情况是：男整劳动力170—180天，女整劳动力70—80天，附带劳动力极大部分没有使用起来。同年，东诗经村的红星社就大不相同：男整半劳动力平均出勤270天，其中有10％出勤300—324天，女整半劳动力平均出勤230天，其中有10％出勤280—320天，附带劳动力有80％出勤100天，其中一部分出勤200天以上。按照这三种不同的情况来计算，全县还可以增加大批的劳动力投入生产。现在，全县入社男劳动力（折整）107，176个，女劳动力（折整）108，817个，附带劳动力（折整）15，000个。按红星社情况看，男整劳动力平均出工300天，女整劳动力出工200天，附带劳动力80％出勤100天，是可能的。这样，共能出工5，711万多个，再减去5％的机动数，还可以出工5，412万多个。这样可以比去年一般初级社的出工水平（2，400多万个）提高一倍多。
    怎样扩大出勤率呢？
    一、进行劳动光荣教育和仔细算账，发动社员自报投工计划；然后，根据社内的劳动力使用计划，进行合理的调整。过去，受落后的生产水平的限制，出现了“劳动力剩余”的假象。缺勤多的，大部分是带孩子的妇女，中农的当家人，极少数的懒婆懒汉。转成高级社以后，人们明白了多劳多得的道理，再经过政治教育和算收入账，社员的劳动积极性可以大大提高。
    社员自报投工计划后，社内领导人员还要加以适当的安排，使各户社员出工的多少合理，使各队生产任务和劳动力的多少、强弱相适应。要注意根据技术和体力情况，给附带劳动力恰当地安排工作，可以让他们做果树整枝，饲养牲畜，看孩子，选种等工作。
    二、把妇女劳动力解放出来投入生产，这是了不起的一支力量。发动妇女的关键，是向轻视妇女的封建残余思想作斗争，解决妇女带孩子的问题和男女同工同酬问题。红星社去年有女劳动力586个，其中有带孩子的青壮年劳动力279个。去年春播前，孩子占着123个女整劳动力、87个半劳动力和附带劳动力，共210人不能参加生产。组织了简单的托儿互助，普遍采用了小型的个别寄托、合理互助的方法，并且解决了一些家庭婆媳不和、老年不管孩子的问题，腾出了101个女劳力投入生产。妇女参加生产，几乎把400多亩梨林、1，000多亩棉花全部包了起来。
    第二，提高劳动效率。建成高级社以后，社员的生产积极性确实大大提高了。但是，一般劳动效率还不高。今后生产任务巨大，不能单靠增加劳动强度来解决问题，必须从各方面提高劳动效率。
    一、推广先进经验，提高技术水平，可以使劳动效率提高一倍到几倍。拿农业操作来说，在没有机械化以前，在现有基础上改进技术是十分重要的。现有的农业操作技术有先进的，有落后的，效率相差很大。一般的合作社，男社员会全套农活、做得又快又好的，仅占20％；在女社员中，就更少了。用新式步犁耕地技术好的，一天能耕六、七亩；技术差的只耕三、四亩，而且粗糙。如果把落后的大部分提高到先进的水平，生产效率就会有显著的变化。提高技术水平的主要办法是：在整编生产队、组的时候，根据技术高低，适当搭配，保教保学；在社内建立技术学校，按照季节农活传授技术。
    总结和推广群众中的先进经验，也是提高劳动效率的有效方法。我们计划打砖井5万眼，除利用现有的砖以外，还需要烧砖13，000万个。如果打200个新窑，按旧法烧砖，需要8个多月才能完成。在群众中发现了‘烧串窑’的方法，同样打200个新窑，1个多月就可以烧完，可以节省人工10万多个。
    二、合理确定工作定额，搞好包工包产，也是提高劳动效率和保证工作质量的重要措施。我们先在红星社搞出了工作定额方案和包工计划，然后在全县普遍推行。
    第三，加强计划性。农业生产时间性很强，一事之误就会造成很大的损失。去年诗经村红星社到谷雨节后，抓住了次要农活，而把棉花晚种了一天，结果，1，900亩棉花减产籽棉10万斤。合作社在制定劳动规划的时候，要算任务，算劳力，算时间，摸清底数，根据任务和劳力情况适当搭配和调整。红星社今年这样计算的结果，发现农业建设方面缺工5万多个，就减去4种副业生产，减少集体养猪数目（各户多养），腾出了5万多个工，拨到水利基本建设方面。
