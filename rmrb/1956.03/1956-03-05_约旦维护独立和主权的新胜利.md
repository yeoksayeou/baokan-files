    New Victory for Jordan in Maintaining Independence and Sovereignty
    Cui Qi
    On March 2nd, Jordanian officials announced that King Hussein of Jordan had relieved British officer Glubb Pasha of his duties as Chief of General Staff of the Jordanian Army and Commander of the "Arab Legion," and also relieved some other British officers from the "Arab Legion." These positions will be filled by Jordanian officers. Hussein pointed out that Jordan took this action to "restore our stolen rights." Obviously, this action is in line with Jordan's national sovereignty and interests, and therefore has been warmly welcomed and supported by the Jordanian people.
    The so-called "Arab Legion" was established by the British in Jordan in 1923. It is Jordan's main military force. This legion has always been trained and commanded by British officers, and most of its military expenses are provided by the British, making it an important tool for Britain to control Jordan militarily and financially. British officer Glubb Pasha had been the commander of this legion since 1939, enjoying the privileged status in Jordan that Western newspapers called the "uncrowned king of Jordan." British colonialists had continuously interfered in Jordan's internal affairs through Glubb Pasha and the "Arab Legion" under his control. Not long ago, British Imperial Chief of General Staff Templer arrived in Amman and, together with Glubb Pasha, carried out activities to coerce Jordan into joining the Baghdad Pact. When the Jordanian people rose up to resist this conspiracy, Glubb Pasha used the "Arab Legion" to suppress the Jordanian people. These situations show that the removal of Glubb Pasha is completely necessary for safeguarding Jordan's national sovereignty, getting rid of foreign control, and ensuring national security.
    In recent years, due to the increasing awakening of the Jordanian people and the rising tide of national independence movements, changes have also taken place within this "Arab Legion," which has long been controlled by the British. Many patriotic Arab soldiers with national self-esteem demanded the protection of their national interests, opposed British control, and opposed joining the Baghdad Pact. The development of this situation was obviously unfavorable to the colonialists. Therefore, according to Western news agencies, when Templer went to Amman to carry out activities, he "participated in the reorganization of the Arab Legion headquarters," attempting to use "power" to stop the growth of anti-British sentiment within the legion. He also demanded that the Jordanian government agree to place the "Arab Legion" headquarters under the jurisdiction of a British military advisory group to further strengthen British direct control over the legion. The British colonialists' calculation was that grasping the "Arab Legion" was equivalent to grasping the hilt of a knife, so they could arbitrarily manipulate Jordan, drag it into the Baghdad Pact, and further turn it into a spearhead threatening countries such as Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia. However, the colonialists' calculations failed. The Jordanian people responded to the Anglo-American plan to expand military blocs in the Middle East with a fervent patriotic struggle against military blocs and colonialism. The Anglo-American conspiracy to drag Jordan into the Baghdad Pact and turn it into a spearhead of colonialism and aggression in the Arab region suffered a shameful defeat. Not only that, Jordan has instead become an outpost against the Baghdad Pact. The British attempt to strengthen its control over the "Arab Legion" has now met with the same result, and the Jordanian people are now rising up to demand the complete recovery of their sovereignty. The removal of Glubb Pasha is a new development and a new victory in the Jordanian people's struggle against the Baghdad Pact, and a new development and a new victory in the Jordanian people's movement against colonialism and in defense of national sovereignty. This victory reflects one of the most prominent characteristics of the Middle East situation today, which is that the people of the Middle Eastern countries have determined to completely get rid of the colonialists who have been riding on them for a long time and strive for the independent development of their nations and countries. Damascus Radio in Syria put it well: "The fall of Glubb Pasha symbolizes the collapse of the imperialist structure in the Arab world."
    The decision to remove Glubb Pasha not only conforms to the national interests of Jordan, but also conforms to the national interests of all Arab countries and the interests of peace in the entire Middle East region. Therefore, this decision has generally aroused enthusiastic reactions in Arab countries, and political leaders of Arab countries have sent many congratulatory telegrams to Jordan. Arab public opinion pointed out that Jordan's action will help Arab countries better cooperate with each other. As everyone knows, not long ago, Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia announced their agreement to provide Jordan with financial assistance to replace British financial subsidies to Jordan. On March 3rd, Syrian Prime Minister Ghazi announced in parliament that the three countries were prepared to take immediate action in this regard. The three countries also authorized Ghazi to announce that they would regard any aggression against Jordan as aggression against them. Ghazi also expressed his hope to see Jordan get rid of all foreign shackles soon. When Britain threatened with "possible consequences," these things demonstrated the spirit of unity and mutual assistance among Arab countries, which is of great significance to the common struggle of Arab countries to maintain national independence and national security.
    Of course, Western colonialists will not be reconciled to Jordan's actions. The news of the removal of Glubb Pasha has caused "shock" in London and Washington. The British government held an "emergency meeting" on March 2nd for this purpose. There are also reports that Britain is discussing countermeasures with the United States and France. However, no matter what new means of interference and oppression the Western colonialists will take, one thing is certain, that is, they cannot stop the forward development of the anti-colonialist movement of Jordan and the Middle Eastern people. The struggle of the people of the Middle Eastern countries to unite and resist imperialist aggression and safeguard national independence and sovereignty will surely be victorious.

    约旦维护独立和主权的新胜利
    崔奇
    3月2日，约旦官方宣布，约旦国王侯赛尼已经解除了英国军官格拉布所担任的约旦陆军总参谋长和“阿拉伯军团”司令的职务，同时也解除了“阿拉伯军团”中一些其他英国军官的职务。这些职务都将由约旦军官来担任。侯赛尼指出，约旦采取这个行动是为了“恢复我们的被偷窃的权利”。非常明显，这个行动是符合约旦的国家主权和利益的，因此受到了约旦人民的热烈欢迎和支持。
    所谓“阿拉伯军团”，是1923年由英国在约旦建立的。它是约旦的主要军事力量。这个军团一直由英国军官训练和指挥，并由英国供给大部分军费，成为英国从军事上和财政上控制约旦的重要工具。英国军官格拉布从1939年起就担任这个军团的司令，在约旦据有被西方报刊称为“约旦的无冕王”的特权地位。英国殖民者曾经不断地通过格拉布和他所控制的“阿拉伯军团”来干涉约旦内政。不久以前，英帝国总参谋长田普勒到达安曼，就是同格拉布一起进行了压迫约旦加入巴格达条约的活动。当约旦人民起来反抗这种阴谋的时候，格拉布又曾利用“阿拉伯军团”来镇压约旦人民。这些情况说明，撤换格拉布，对于维护约旦的国家主权，摆脱外国的控制，保障国家的安全，是完全必要的。
    近年来，由于约旦人民日益觉醒，民族独立运动日益高涨，在这个长期由英国所控制的“阿拉伯军团”内部也发生了变化。不少爱国的和具有民族自尊心的阿拉伯军人都要求维护自己的民族利益，反对英国的控制，并反对参加巴格达条约。这种情况的发展显然是对殖民者不利的。因此，据西方通讯社报道，当田普勒到安曼进行活动时，曾“参与了阿拉伯军团司令部的改组工作”，企图使用“威力”来制止军团内部的反英情绪的增长。他并且要求约旦政府答应把“阿拉伯军团”司令部放在一个英国军事顾问派遣团的管辖之下，以进一步加强英国对这个军团的直接控制。英国殖民者的算盘是，抓住了“阿拉伯军团”就等于抓住了刀柄，就可以任意摆布约旦，把它拖入巴格达条约，并进而把它变为威胁叙利亚、黎巴嫩、埃及和沙特阿拉伯等国的矛头。但是，殖民者的算盘落空了。约旦人民以如火如荼的反对军事集团和殖民主义的爱国斗争来回答英美在中近东扩大军事集团的计划。英美要把约旦拖进巴格达条约，把它变为在阿拉伯地区的殖民主义和侵略的矛头的阴谋遭到了可耻的失败，不仅如此，约旦反而变成了反对巴格达条约的一个前哨。英国想加强它对“阿拉伯军团”的控制的企图现在也遭到了同样的结果，约旦人民现在起来要求完全收回他们的主权。撤换格拉布是约旦人民反对巴格达条约斗争的新发展和新胜利，是约旦人民反对殖民主义和维护民族主权的运动的新发展和新胜利。这个胜利反映了今天中近东局势的一个最突出的特点，这就是中近东各国人民已经决心彻底摆脱长期骑在他们身上的殖民主义者，争取自己民族和国家的独立发展。叙利亚大马士革电台说得好：“格拉布的垮台象征着在阿拉伯世界的帝国主义结构的垮台。”
    撤换格拉布的决定不仅符合于约旦的民族利益，而且符合于所有阿拉伯国家的民族利益和整个中近东地区的和平的利益。因此这个决定在阿拉伯国家普遍引起热烈的反应，阿拉伯各国的政治领袖向约旦拍去了许多祝贺电报。阿拉伯国家舆论指出，约旦这个行动将有助于阿拉伯各国更好地进行合作。大家知道，不久以前埃及、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯三国曾宣布同意给予约旦财政援助，来代替英国对约旦的财政补助。3月3日，叙利亚总理加齐在议会宣布三国准备在这方面立即采取行动。三国并且授权加齐宣布，它们将把对约旦的任何侵略看作是对它们的侵略。加齐还表示希望看到约旦不久摆脱一切外国束缚。当英国以“可能产生的后果”相威胁的时候，这些事情表现了阿拉伯各国的团结互助精神，这种精神对于阿拉伯各国维护民族独立和国家安全的共同斗争，是有重要意义的。
    当然，西方殖民主义者对于约旦的这个行动是不会甘心的。撤换格拉布的消息已经引起伦敦和华盛顿的“震惊”。英国政府在3月2日为此召开了“紧急会议”。还有消息说，英国正在同美法两国商量对策。但是，不管西方殖民主义者将要采取什么新的干涉和压迫手段，有一点是肯定的，就是他们无法阻止约旦和中近东人民反殖民主义运动的向前发展。中近东各国人民团结一致反抗帝国主义侵略，维护民族独立和主权的斗争是一定会胜利的。
