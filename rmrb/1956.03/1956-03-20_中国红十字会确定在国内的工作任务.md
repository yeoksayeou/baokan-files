    The Chinese Red Cross Society recently determined that its domestic work tasks in the future will mainly be to mobilize and organize the broad masses to participate in amateur health activities, popularize health knowledge, improve people's health, strengthen health defense, and implement self-rescue and mutual assistance during military actions and natural disasters.

    In order to undertake the new tasks, in addition to consolidating the existing one provincial office, 44 municipal branches, and 36 county branches, the Chinese Red Cross Society will establish provincial Red Cross Societies in 19 provinces including Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Liaoning, Sichuan, and Shaanxi. It will also establish 91 municipal Red Cross Societies and 10 county Red Cross Societies in provincial capitals, industrial areas, coastal areas, and transportation hubs, develop members, and establish grassroots organizations.

    Each municipal and county Red Cross Society will conduct 24 hours of "health and national defense" training for its members, and form non-full-time health stations and health teams according to grassroots production units and street communities. It is estimated that more than 9,900 health stations can be organized, and more than 290 health teams will be built in coastal areas as key pilot projects.

    Local Red Cross Societies will assist health authorities in conducting regular health supervision and health and epidemic prevention work, and carry out health publicity and education for members and the people, and actively promote the regularization of the Patriotic Health Campaign.

    Local Red Cross Societies will also mobilize members and the masses to actively participate in the elimination of the "four pests" and the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis and other most harmful diseases through grassroots membership organizations.

    为了承担新任务，中国红十字会除了整顿原有的一个省办事处、44个市分会和36个县分会的组织以外，将在河北、山东、河南、辽宁、四川、陕西等十九个省成立省红十字会，并将在各省省会、工业地区、沿海地区和交通要地，共成立91个市红十字会和10个县红十字会，发展会员，建立基层组织。
    各市、县红十字会将对会员进行24小时的“卫生卫国”训练，并按基层生产单位和街道组成不脱产的卫生站和卫生队，约计可以组织9，900多个卫生站，在沿海地区重点试建290多个卫生队。
    各地红十字会将协助卫生机关进行经常性卫生监督和保健防疫工作，并对会员和人民群众进行卫生宣传教育，积极推动爱国卫生运动经常化。
    各地红十字会还将通过会员基层组织，发动会员和群众积极参加除“四害”和防治血吸虫病等为害最大的疾病。
