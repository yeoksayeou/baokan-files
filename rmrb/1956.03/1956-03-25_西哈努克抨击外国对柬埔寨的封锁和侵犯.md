Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 24th: A Phnom Penh dispatch: Cambodian Prime Minister Norodom Sihanouk delivered a speech on Phnom Penh radio on the evening of March 23rd, addressing the current situation in Cambodia. He stated that since Cambodia implemented its neutral policy and sent a delegation to visit China, Cambodia's neighbors have been creating difficulties for Cambodia in various aspects. These include invading Cambodian islands at sea, sending police and troops to occupy Cambodian land, and dispatching aircraft to violate Cambodian airspace, which are violations of international law. Cambodia has lodged protests. However, not only have they failed to respond, but they have also blockaded Cambodia's borders.

Sihanouk said that this situation has arisen because Cambodia's political line is causing dissatisfaction to others. This situation has led to rising prices in Cambodia, and foreign goods cannot be imported.

Sihanouk said that in order to follow the will of the people, Cambodia will not invade Thailand, South Vietnam, or any major power, but it will never surrender to anyone. Cambodia would rather endure temporary difficulties in order to find a way to get rid of that control; although Cambodia is encountering these difficulties because of its neutrality, the people have declared that they must maintain neutrality.

Sihanouk also mentioned that in order to overcome difficulties, the Cambodian government will send delegations to friendly countries to discuss trade issues and halt unnecessary imports of goods.

    西哈努克抨击外国对柬埔寨的封锁和侵犯
    新华社河内24日电　金边消息：柬埔寨王国政府首相西哈努克三月二十三日晚上在金边电台就目前柬埔寨的情况发表了谈话。他说，自从柬埔寨执行中立政策和派遣代表团访问中国以后，柬埔寨的邻国就在各方面给柬埔寨制造困难。如侵犯柬埔寨海上的岛屿，派警察和军队占领柬埔寨的土地，派飞机侵犯柬埔寨的领空，这是违犯国际公法的。柬埔寨已经提出了抗议。但是他们不但不答复，他们还封锁柬埔寨的边境。
    西哈努克说，这是由于柬埔寨的政治路线使别人不满意而产生的情况。这种情况已使得柬埔寨物价上涨，而外国的货物又不能入口。
    西哈努克说，为了遵循人民的意志，柬埔寨不侵犯泰国，南越或者某一个强国，但是，也绝不向谁投降。柬埔寨宁愿遭受一时的困难，以设法摆脱那种控制；虽然柬埔寨由于中立而碰到这些困难，但是人民宣布一定要保持中立。
    西哈努克还谈到为了克服困难，柬埔寨王国政府将派遣代表团到各友好国家以商谈贸易问题和停止不必要的货物进口。
