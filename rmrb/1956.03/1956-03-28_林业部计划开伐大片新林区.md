Ministry of Forestry Plans to Exploit Large New Forest Areas

The Ministry of Forestry will systematically and methodically exploit large new forest areas such as the Greater Khingan Mountains, the Lesser Khingan Mountains, Changbai Mountain, and Heihe, and has decided to complete the overall design work for fifteen newly built and expanded logging enterprises, including Fenglin, Hongqi, Heihe, and Genhe, ahead of schedule, in order to meet the country's industrialization and agricultural collectivization needs for timber.

The forest areas to be exploited this year are all primitive economic forests, containing valuable timber such as Korean pine, Sakhalin fir, Dahurian larch, Masson's pine, Chinese fir, Amur cork tree, and Manchurian ash. The newly built Fenglin Forestry Bureau in the Lesser Khingan Mountains alone has a forest area of more than 81,000 hectares. The Heihe Forestry Bureau is being established this year in the Qionglai Mountains, a tributary of the Minjiang River. In this forest area, precious fir and spruce account for more than 80% of the total forest stock, and the forest area is approximately 70,000 hectares.

Among the fifteen newly built and expanded logging enterprises, eight will be put into production in 1957. After all of these new logging enterprises are put into production, the maximum annual logging volume is estimated to increase by about 25% compared to the current national timber production volume.

In order to ensure that the timber from the newly exploited forest areas is continuously supplied to meet the needs of national construction, the Ministry of Forestry plans to install a large number of tractors, winches, power stations, electric saws, newly built forest railways, timber transport roads, timber processing plants, and lumber yards in these newly built logging enterprises.

In order to complete the above tasks, the Ministry of Forestry has gathered 1,250 engineering and technical personnel and established five specialized design institutions, which are currently actively engaged in surveying and design work.

    林业部计划开伐大片新林区
    林业部将有计划有步骤地开伐大兴安岭、小兴安岭、长白山、黑水等大片新林区，并且决定提前完成丰林、红旗、黑水、根河等十五个新建和扩建采伐企业总体设计工作，以满足国家工业化和农业集体化对木材的需要。
    今年决定开伐的林区都是原始经济林。有红松、鱼鳞松、落叶松、马尾松、杉木、黄波罗、水曲柳等珍贵木材。仅在小兴安岭上新建的丰林森林工业局，林地面积就有八万一千多公顷。在岷江支流邛来山脉，今年建立黑水森林工业局，该林区珍贵的冷杉、云杉占全林蓄积量80％以上，林区面积约七万多公顷。
    新建和扩建的十五个采伐企业中，有八个采伐企业将于1957年投入生产。这些新建采伐企业全部投入生产后，以最高年伐量计算，约比现在全国木材生产量增加25％。
    为了保证开伐新林区的木材源源供应祖国建设需要，林业部计划在这些新建采伐企业中，将设置大批拖拉机、绞盘机、电站、电锯、新建森林铁路、运材公路、木材加工厂、贮木场等。
    林业部为了完成上述任务，集中了1，250名工程技术人员，成立了五个专业设计机构，现正积极进行勘测设计中。
