    Concretely Lead Mountain Area Construction
    Zhou Zhenhua, Secretary of the Tangshan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Hebei Province
    The northern part of Tangshan Prefecture in Hebei Province, with its 12,000 square kilometers of land, was originally a poor mountainous area. Before liberation, after the long period of devastation by the Japanese invaders and the destruction once inflicted by the Kuomintang army, the mountain forests suffered damage, soil and water loss was severe, grain yield was extremely low, and the lives of the broad masses were even more miserable. After liberation, although the peasants were allocated land and received large amounts of relief grain and funds from the state, and the Party and the People's Government led the masses to carry out a production self-rescue movement; due to the deep wounds, the weak foundation, and the decentralized management of the small-scale peasant economy, it was difficult to change the situation of "living among wild grass and barren mountains, suffering from constant shortage of food and clothing" and "eating bran and vegetables for half the year, and wearing one outfit for three years." The masses also lacked confidence in building the mountainous areas, and many peasants blindly flowed to cities and plains, and even many cadres were not willing to work in the mountainous areas.

    In light of this situation, the Tangshan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to strengthen the specific leadership of the construction of the mountainous areas and gradually and thoroughly change the face of the mountainous areas. Therefore, in 1952, the first conference of peasant representatives from the mountainous areas was convened to convey the care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao for the construction of the mountainous areas, to implement Chairman Mao's great call to "carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory," and to conduct socialist long-term education. After that, such a conference was held every year to plan the construction of the mountainous areas and exchange production experiences. It gradually corrected the pessimistic sentiment among the masses that the mountainous areas could not build socialism, gradually established the confidence in building the mountainous areas by "relying on the mountains for food and nurturing the mountains," and proposed a comprehensive slogan for building the mountainous areas: "Transform barren mountains into green forests, transform terraced fields into orchards, transform grasslands into pastures, and transform dry land into paddy fields."

    In leading the construction of the mountainous areas, in addition to grasping the central link of gradually developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement and giving full play to the fortress role of the grassroots Party organizations, the Prefectural Committee particularly emphasized the leadership method of "cultivating typical examples, commending models, focusing on key points, and promoting the overall situation." It focused on cultivating Yuan Shizhen, a national model for afforestation in Junzikou Village, Zunhua County, as a typical example for building mountainous areas.

    As early as before liberation, Yuan Shizhen overcame various difficulties and first built a small pine forest on a barren mountain and cultivated two mu of orchard. This broke the conservative idea that barren mountains could not be afforested and greatly increased Yuan Shizhen's income. However, at that time, he was simply trying to get rid of poverty and get rich, and he did not understand the significance of his actions for the construction of mountainous areas. In 1938, Yuan Shizhen joined the Communist Party of China. After being elected as the secretary of the village's branch in 1940, the Party encouraged and helped Yuan Shizhen to promote the transformation of the mountain village by the masses. Yuan Shizhen also regarded transforming the mountain village to make everyone prosperous together as his task. Under Yuan Shizhen's propaganda, help and influence, afforestation and fruit tree cultivation activities gradually unfolded among the masses. Thus, Yuan Shizhen was elected as the afforestation model of the entire special zone in 1948, the afforestation model of the entire province in 1949, and the national afforestation model in 1950. In order to spread his advanced experience and promote the construction of the entire mountainous area, the Prefectural Committee further cultivated Yuan Shizhen. Not only did the responsible cadres of the County Committee and the District Committee often come to this village to help and guide the work, but also the responsible comrades of the Prefectural Committee had to come here several times a year to understand the situation and solve problems. For example, the issue of fruit tree dividend, the issue of diverting water to the mountains, the issue of promoting new technologies, and the issue of afforestation seedlings were gradually resolved under the guidance and assistance of Party organizations at all levels and relevant departments. This had a decisive effect on the consolidation of cooperatives and the development of production.

    While cultivating typical examples, the advanced experience of this typical example was continuously publicized to promote the construction of the entire mountainous area. At the annual conference of peasant representatives from the mountainous areas, the advanced experience of Junzikou in building the mountainous areas was introduced, and the Party organizations at all levels were asked to lead the peasants to launch a movement to learn from Yuan Shizhen in building the mountainous areas, and to organize the peasants to conduct on-the-spot visits to Junzikou. This learning movement played a great role in enhancing the confidence of cadres and the masses in building the mountainous areas and creating richer experience in building the mountainous areas. After Zunhua County organized the peasants of various villages to visit Junzikou, many masses changed their past negative sentiment that "poor mountains and bad waters cannot build socialism" and began to actively build the mountainous areas. After learning from Yuan Shizhen's experience in building the mountainous areas, the masses of Baita Village in Qianxi County put forward the slogan of "catching up with Junzikou." In 1954 alone, the whole village cultivated 44 mu of fruit tree seedlings, jointly afforested 500 mu, planted 2,740 fruit trees, and formulated a three-year mountainous area construction plan. Cao Yu, a Communist Party member in Shashiå³ª Village, Zunhua County, created a method of diverting water over bridges based on Yuan Shizhen's principle of diverting water to the mountains, turning 200 mu of mountain land into paddy fields, planting 200 mu of wheat for the first time, and achieving a bumper harvest. Gao Yong, the secretary of the Party branch of Baimayu Village in Zunhua County, also led the masses to create the miracle of diverting water around the mountains, so that the trees and terraced fields on the mountainside could be irrigated. In the past few years, a large number of model figures have emerged in the mountainous area construction movement. In 1955 alone, 574 models of various types emerged.

    In leading the construction of the mountainous areas, Party organizations at all levels also paid special attention to studying and promoting new technologies. In agriculture, based on the characteristics of thin soil layers, small land fertility, many diseases and insect pests, and susceptibility to drought in the mountainous areas, key yield-increasing measures such as deep plowing to preserve moisture, appropriate close planting, rational fertilization, pest and disease control, and strengthening late-stage management were vigorously promoted, which significantly increased the unit area yield of food crops. The average yield per mu in 1952 was more than 120 jin, and in 1955 it reached 254 jin. In forestry, local afforestation technologies such as close planting, close sowing, deep digging and shallow planting, fine land preparation, and appropriate soil covering were summarized and promoted. Yuan Shizhen's small-scale block seedling raising method in mountainous areas and Tian Kui's clump planting method were also promoted. At the same time, a series of technical reforms such as pest control, pruning, bark scraping, whitewashing, fertilization, and fruit thinning were vigorously carried out. This greatly increased the amount of forest trees in the entire mountainous area, and the fruit yield also greatly increased. In the past few years, more than 430,000 mu of barren mountains have been afforested, an increase of 15% compared to the original forest area. The number of fruit trees in 1955 increased by 61% compared to 1952. The fruit yield in 1955 increased by 80% compared to 1952.

    With the development of agriculture and forestry, people's lives have been significantly improved, and the appearance of the mountainous areas has begun to change. The vast majority of districts and townships in the entire special zone, except for some districts and townships in Qianxi and Funing counties, have changed the situation of food shortage, and some districts and townships have a large surplus of grain. For example, Jiming Village District in Zunhua County needed the state to supply 1.63 million jin of grain in 1953, but by 1955 the situation had undergone a fundamental change. The entire district was self-sufficient in grain and had a surplus of 630,000 jin.

    In the past few years, the remarkable achievements in building mountainous areas through mutual aid and cooperation have made the broad masses realize that organizing is the only way to change from poverty to wealth. Therefore, after Comrade Mao Zedong's report on the issue of agricultural cooperation and the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party were widely publicized among the masses, the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses was further stimulated. By mid-February of this year, 99.2% of all peasant households in the mountainous areas had joined advanced cooperatives. In order to lead the construction of the mountainous areas more actively and with better planning, the Prefectural Committee has formulated a comprehensive plan for the construction of the mountainous areas. By 1962, the yield per mu of grain will be increased from 264 jin in 1955 to 1,000 jin. The yield per mu of peanuts will be increased from 227 jin in 1955 to 475 jin. On the basis of the 3.24 million mu area in 1955, afforestation will be carried out to green all 8 million mu of barren mountains in the entire region. On the basis of the 5.2 million trees of various fruit trees in 1955, the number will be increased to 24.7 million trees. The total output of fruits and dried fruits will be increased from 7.54 million jin in 1955 to 200 million jin. Animal husbandry will also have great development. At that time, all mountainous areas will be covered with terraced fields covered with fruit trees, and everywhere will be a green ocean. All mountainous areas will be transformed into a land of flowers and fruits.
