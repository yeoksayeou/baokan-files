    Concretely Lead Mountain Area Construction
    Zhou Zhenhua, Secretary of the Tangshan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Hebei Province
    The northern part of Tangshan Prefecture in Hebei Province, with its 12,000 square kilometers of land, was originally a poor mountainous area. Before liberation, after the long period of devastation by the Japanese invaders and the destruction once inflicted by the Kuomintang army, the mountain forests suffered damage, soil and water loss was severe, grain yield was extremely low, and the lives of the broad masses were even more miserable. After liberation, although the peasants were allocated land and received large amounts of relief grain and funds from the state, and the Party and the People's Government led the masses to carry out a production self-rescue movement; due to the deep wounds, the weak foundation, and the decentralized management of the small-scale peasant economy, it was difficult to change the situation of "living among wild grass and barren mountains, suffering from constant shortage of food and clothing" and "eating bran and vegetables for half the year, and wearing one outfit for three years." The masses also lacked confidence in building the mountainous areas, and many peasants blindly flowed to cities and plains, and even many cadres were not willing to work in the mountainous areas.

    In light of this situation, the Tangshan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to strengthen the specific leadership of the construction of the mountainous areas and gradually and thoroughly change the face of the mountainous areas. Therefore, in 1952, the first conference of peasant representatives from the mountainous areas was convened to convey the care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao for the construction of the mountainous areas, to implement Chairman Mao's great call to "carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory," and to conduct socialist long-term education. After that, such a conference was held every year to plan the construction of the mountainous areas and exchange production experiences. It gradually corrected the pessimistic sentiment among the masses that the mountainous areas could not build socialism, gradually established the confidence in building the mountainous areas by "relying on the mountains for food and nurturing the mountains," and proposed a comprehensive slogan for building the mountainous areas: "Transform barren mountains into green forests, transform terraced fields into orchards, transform grasslands into pastures, and transform dry land into paddy fields."

    In leading the construction of the mountainous areas, in addition to grasping the central link of gradually developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement and giving full play to the fortress role of the grassroots Party organizations, the Prefectural Committee particularly emphasized the leadership method of "cultivating typical examples, commending models, focusing on key points, and promoting the overall situation." It focused on cultivating Yuan Shizhen, a national model for afforestation in Junzikou Village, Zunhua County, as a typical example for building mountainous areas.

    As early as before liberation, Yuan Shizhen overcame various difficulties and first built a small pine forest on a barren mountain and cultivated two mu of orchard. This broke the conservative idea that barren mountains could not be afforested and greatly increased Yuan Shizhen's income. However, at that time, he was simply trying to get rid of poverty and get rich, and he did not understand the significance of his actions for the construction of mountainous areas. In 1938, Yuan Shizhen joined the Communist Party of China. After being elected as the secretary of the village's branch in 1940, the Party encouraged and helped Yuan Shizhen to promote the transformation of the mountain village by the masses. Yuan Shizhen also regarded transforming the mountain village to make everyone prosperous together as his task. Under Yuan Shizhen's propaganda, help and influence, afforestation and fruit tree cultivation activities gradually unfolded among the masses. Thus, Yuan Shizhen was elected as the afforestation model of the entire special zone in 1948, the afforestation model of the entire province in 1949, and the national afforestation model in 1950. In order to spread his advanced experience and promote the construction of the entire mountainous area, the Prefectural Committee further cultivated Yuan Shizhen. Not only did the responsible cadres of the County Committee and the District Committee often come to this village to help and guide the work, but also the responsible comrades of the Prefectural Committee had to come here several times a year to understand the situation and solve problems. For example, the issue of fruit tree dividend, the issue of diverting water to the mountains, the issue of promoting new technologies, and the issue of afforestation seedlings were gradually resolved under the guidance and assistance of Party organizations at all levels and relevant departments. This had a decisive effect on the consolidation of cooperatives and the development of production.

    While cultivating typical examples, the advanced experience of this typical example was continuously publicized to promote the construction of the entire mountainous area. At the annual conference of peasant representatives from the mountainous areas, the advanced experience of Junzikou in building the mountainous areas was introduced, and the Party organizations at all levels were asked to lead the peasants to launch a movement to learn from Yuan Shizhen in building the mountainous areas, and to organize the peasants to conduct on-the-spot visits to Junzikou. This learning movement played a great role in enhancing the confidence of cadres and the masses in building the mountainous areas and creating richer experience in building the mountainous areas. After Zunhua County organized the peasants of various villages to visit Junzikou, many masses changed their past negative sentiment that "poor mountains and bad waters cannot build socialism" and began to actively build the mountainous areas. After learning from Yuan Shizhen's experience in building the mountainous areas, the masses of Baita Village in Qianxi County put forward the slogan of "catching up with Junzikou." In 1954 alone, the whole village cultivated 44 mu of fruit tree seedlings, jointly afforested 500 mu, planted 2,740 fruit trees, and formulated a three-year mountainous area construction plan. Cao Yu, a Communist Party member in Shashi峪 Village, Zunhua County, created a method of diverting water over bridges based on Yuan Shizhen's principle of diverting water to the mountains, turning 200 mu of mountain land into paddy fields, planting 200 mu of wheat for the first time, and achieving a bumper harvest. Gao Yong, the secretary of the Party branch of Baimayu Village in Zunhua County, also led the masses to create the miracle of diverting water around the mountains, so that the trees and terraced fields on the mountainside could be irrigated. In the past few years, a large number of model figures have emerged in the mountainous area construction movement. In 1955 alone, 574 models of various types emerged.

    In leading the construction of the mountainous areas, Party organizations at all levels also paid special attention to studying and promoting new technologies. In agriculture, based on the characteristics of thin soil layers, small land fertility, many diseases and insect pests, and susceptibility to drought in the mountainous areas, key yield-increasing measures such as deep plowing to preserve moisture, appropriate close planting, rational fertilization, pest and disease control, and strengthening late-stage management were vigorously promoted, which significantly increased the unit area yield of food crops. The average yield per mu in 1952 was more than 120 jin, and in 1955 it reached 254 jin. In forestry, local afforestation technologies such as close planting, close sowing, deep digging and shallow planting, fine land preparation, and appropriate soil covering were summarized and promoted. Yuan Shizhen's small-scale block seedling raising method in mountainous areas and Tian Kui's clump planting method were also promoted. At the same time, a series of technical reforms such as pest control, pruning, bark scraping, whitewashing, fertilization, and fruit thinning were vigorously carried out. This greatly increased the amount of forest trees in the entire mountainous area, and the fruit yield also greatly increased. In the past few years, more than 430,000 mu of barren mountains have been afforested, an increase of 15% compared to the original forest area. The number of fruit trees in 1955 increased by 61% compared to 1952. The fruit yield in 1955 increased by 80% compared to 1952.

    With the development of agriculture and forestry, people's lives have been significantly improved, and the appearance of the mountainous areas has begun to change. The vast majority of districts and townships in the entire special zone, except for some districts and townships in Qianxi and Funing counties, have changed the situation of food shortage, and some districts and townships have a large surplus of grain. For example, Jiming Village District in Zunhua County needed the state to supply 1.63 million jin of grain in 1953, but by 1955 the situation had undergone a fundamental change. The entire district was self-sufficient in grain and had a surplus of 630,000 jin.

    In the past few years, the remarkable achievements in building mountainous areas through mutual aid and cooperation have made the broad masses realize that organizing is the only way to change from poverty to wealth. Therefore, after Comrade Mao Zedong's report on the issue of agricultural cooperation and the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party were widely publicized among the masses, the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses was further stimulated. By mid-February of this year, 99.2% of all peasant households in the mountainous areas had joined advanced cooperatives. In order to lead the construction of the mountainous areas more actively and with better planning, the Prefectural Committee has formulated a comprehensive plan for the construction of the mountainous areas. By 1962, the yield per mu of grain will be increased from 264 jin in 1955 to 1,000 jin. The yield per mu of peanuts will be increased from 227 jin in 1955 to 475 jin. On the basis of the 3.24 million mu area in 1955, afforestation will be carried out to green all 8 million mu of barren mountains in the entire region. On the basis of the 5.2 million trees of various fruit trees in 1955, the number will be increased to 24.7 million trees. The total output of fruits and dried fruits will be increased from 7.54 million jin in 1955 to 200 million jin. Animal husbandry will also have great development. At that time, all mountainous areas will be covered with terraced fields covered with fruit trees, and everywhere will be a green ocean. All mountainous areas will be transformed into a land of flowers and fruits.

    具体地领导山区建设
    中共河北省唐山地委书记　周振华
    河北省唐山专区的北半部，有12，000平方公里的土地，本来就是贫困的山区。解放前，经过日寇长期的蹂躏和国民党军队一度的摧残，山林遭受破坏，水土严重流失，粮食产量极低，广大群众的生活更加困苦不堪。解放以后，农民虽然分到了土地，得到国家大批的救济粮款，党和人民政府又领导群众开展了生产自救运动；但是由于创伤深重，家底虚薄，又处在小农经济分散经营的条件下，因此“落在野草荒山，辈辈少吃缺穿”和“糠菜半年粮，三载着一装”的境况还很难改变。群众对建设山区的信心也不大，不少农民都盲目地向城市和平原流动，甚至不少干部也不安心山区工作。
    根据这种情况，中共唐山地委决定加强对山区建设的具体领导，逐步地彻底地改变山区的面貌。于是在1952年召开了第一次山区农民代表会议，传达了党中央和毛主席对山区建设的关怀，贯彻了毛主席的“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的伟大号召，同时进行了社会主义的远景教育。以后每年都召开一次这样的会议，规划山区建设，交流生产经验。逐步纠正了群众认为山区不能建设社会主义的悲观情绪，逐步树立了“靠山吃山，吃山养山”的建设山区的信心，并且提出“荒山变绿林，梯田变果园，草原变牧场，旱地变水田”的全面建设山区的口号。
    地委在领导山区建设中，除抓紧逐步发展互助合作运动这一中心环节，充分发挥基层党组织的堡垒作用以外，特别强调了“培养典型，表彰模范，通过重点，推动全盘”的领导方法。并重点培养了遵化县君子口村全国造林模范袁世珍建设山区这一典型。
    远在解放以前，袁世珍就克服了种种困难，在荒山上第一次营造了一小块松林，培植了二亩果园，这就打破了荒山不能造林的保守思想，也使得袁世珍大大增加了收入。但是，当时他只是单纯为了摆脱贫困发家致富，并不懂得他这样作对建设山区的意义。1938年袁世珍加入了中国共产党，1940年当选为这个村子的支部书记以后，党就鼓励和帮助袁世珍推动群众改造山村，袁世珍也就把改造山村使大家共同富裕看成是自己的任务。就在袁世珍的宣传帮助和影响之下，群众中也逐步展开了造林和培植果树的活动。这样，袁世珍就在1948年当选为全专区的造林模范，1949年当选为全省的造林模范，1950年又当选为全国的造林模范。地委为了传播他的先进经验，推动整个山区的建设，就对袁世珍作进一步的培养。不仅县委和区委的负责干部经常到这个村子帮助和指导工作，地委的负责同志每年也有几次要到这里了解情况，解决问题。比如果树分红的问题，引水上山的问题，推广新技术的问题以及造林秧苗的问题都是在各级党组织和有关部门的指导和帮助之下逐步解决的。而对合作社的巩固和生产的发展都有决定性的作用。
    在培养典型的同时，不断宣传了这一典型的先进经验，以推动整个山区的建设。在每年召开的山区农民代表会上，都介绍了君子口建设山区的先进经验，并要各级党组织领导农民展开学习袁世珍建设山区的运动，组织农民到君子口进行实地的参观和访问。这一学习运动对提高干部和群众建设山区的信心，创造更丰富的建设山区的经验有很大作用。遵化县组织各村农民到君子口参观访问以后，很多群众改变了过去认为“穷山恶水建设不成社会主义”的消极情绪，开始积极建设山区了。迁西县白塔寨村群众在学习袁世珍建设山区的经验以后，提出了“追赶君子口”的口号，全村仅在1954年就育果树苗44亩，合作造林500亩，栽果树2，740棵，并且订出了三年的山区建设计划。遵化县沙石峪村的共产党员曹玉根据袁世珍引水上山的原理，创造了引水过桥的办法，使200亩山地变成了水田，破天荒地种了200亩麦子，并且得到了丰收。遵化县白马峪村党支部书记高永，也领导群众创造了引水盘山的奇迹，使山腰上下的树木和梯田都能得到水的灌溉。几年来，在山区建设运动中，涌现了大批的模范人物，仅仅1955年一年当中，就出现了各种模范574人。
    在领导山区建设中，各级党组织还特别注意研究和推广新技术。在农业方面，根据山区土层薄、地力小、病虫多，易受旱等特点，大力推广了深耕保墒、适当密植、合理施肥、除治病虫害以及加强后期管理等关键性的增产措施，使粮食作物单位面积产量有了显著的提高。1952年平均每亩产量120多斤，到了1955年就达到254斤了。在林业方面，总结并推广了当地的密植密播、深刨浅种，精细整地，适当复土等造林技术，还推广了袁世珍创造的山地小型块状育苗法，田奎创造的丛起丛植法。同时，大力进行了除虫、修剪、刮皮、涂白、施肥、疏果等一系列技术改革。这就使整个山区的林木有了很大的增加，果产量也有了很大的提高。几年来荒山造林43万多亩，较原有林木面积增加了15％。1955年的果树较1952年增加了61％。1955年的果产量较1952年增加了80％。
    随着农业和林业的发展，人民的生活得到了显著的改善，山区面貌也开始发生了变化。全专区除了迁西、抚宁等县的部分区乡，绝大部分区乡已改变了缺粮的状况，有的区乡并有了大量的余粮。如遵化县鸡鸣村区，1953年还要国家供应粮食163万斤，到1955年情况就有了根本变化，全区粮食自给而外，还有余粮63万斤。
    几年来通过互助合作建设山区的显著成就，使广大群众认识到组织起来是由穷变富的唯一道路。因此，当毛泽东同志的关于农业合作化问题的报告和党的七届六中全会的决议在群众中作了广泛宣传以后，更加激发了广大群众的社会主义积极性。今年2月中旬，全部山区已有99.2％的农户加入了高级合作社。为了更主动更有计划地领导山区建设，地委已经制定了山区建设的全面规划。到1962年，粮食的亩产量要从1955年264斤提高到1，000斤。花生的亩产量要从1955年的227斤提高到475斤。造林要在1955年324万亩面积的基础上将全区800万亩荒山全部绿化。各种果树要在1955年520万株的基础上增加到2，470万株。水果和干果的总产量要从1955年的754万斤的基础上增加到两亿斤。畜牧业也要有很大发展。那时所有山区，漫山将是果树复盖的梯田，到处将是绿色的海洋，全部山区将变成花果之乡。
