Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 21st. Construction workers at the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge have begun their annual race against the flood season. The wide sandy beaches of just a few days ago are now submerged under surging waves. The intense construction season, a yearly challenge against the floods, has begun again.

On the eight bridge pier construction sites spanning the Yangtze River, the sinking of caissons, rock drilling, and concrete work are in full swing. The long arms of cranes are constantly busy, and workboats are densely packed, making the Yangtze River, which is known for its width, seem narrow.

Before this year's flood season, the construction of the first, second, fifth, seventh, and eighth bridge piers must be completed. The first pier is already rising above the water surface. The vanguard of industrialized and mechanized construction is constantly growing. A few days ago, new floating concrete factories, concrete workboats, and tower cranes successively joined the water-based construction. Soon, more efficient rotary drilling rigs and new floating repair ships will also be put into operation. Engineering personnel are also, based on the suggestions of the Soviet expert team, carrying out the design and testing of technically complex heightened flood control equipment, so that even under a high water level of 22 meters in the future, various projects can still be carried out as usual.

While underwater construction is proceeding intensely, progress on the projects on both banks of the bridge is also rapid. Half of the six overpass bridges have been completed, and the other half are under intense construction.

    武汉长江大桥建桥职工开始同洪水竞赛
    据新华社武汉21日电　桃汛开始来到了武汉长江大桥工地。几天以前的宽阔的沙滩，现在都涌上了滚滚波浪。建桥工人们一年一度和洪水竞赛的紧张施工季节又开始了。
    在横跨长江的八个桥墩工地上，下沉管柱、钻岩和混凝土工程正在全面施工，起重机的长臂忙个不停，工作船成群密布，使这条一向以宽阔著称的长江显得狭窄了。
    在今年洪水期以前，第一、二、五、七、八号五个桥墩工程都要完成。现在第一号桥墩已经耸出水面。工厂化和机械化施工的生力军不断在增添。几天以前，新的水上混凝土工厂、混凝土工作船和塔式吊车已经陆续参加水上施工；不久，效率更高的旋转式钻机和新的水上修配船也将投入生产。工程人员们还在根据苏联专家组的建议，进行一个技术复杂的加高防水设备的设计和试验工作，以便在将来22公尺的高水位下，各项工程仍可照常施工。
    和水下工程紧张施工的同时，大桥两岸的工程进展也很快。六座跨线桥一半已完工，一半正在加紧施工。
