    Reduce "The Five Excesses" in Enterprises
    In order to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, in addition to the active and diligent work of comrades in the enterprises, leading organizations should also create some conditions for the enterprises to help them reduce some avoidable difficulties. The phenomenon of "The Five Excesses" in enterprises is one of these difficulties that should and can be reduced. The director of the Qiqihar Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant recently issued this call. He pointed out that in 1955, the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry and the Locomotive Industry Administration issued a total of 7,293 documents and the various enterprises sent more than 5,000 letters. In 1955, there were 734 business trips, totaling 13,739 days, with an average of 38 people from the factory away each day. There were so many meetings that it was impossible to estimate. Taking December as an example, enterprise leaders such as the factory director, Party committee secretary, trade union chairman, and Communist Youth League secretary were effectively not working in the factory, but were all attending meetings everywhere. Adding the time spent returning to convey and discuss matters, the vast majority of their time was spent in meetings. He requested that all parties cherish time in the future to improve work efficiency and ensure the smooth achievement of completing tasks "more, faster, better, and more economically."
    This factory director's call is entirely justified, and all leading organizations should support it and effectively reduce "The Five Excesses" in enterprises.

    减少企业中的“五多”
    为了提前完成五年计划，除了企业中的同志们要积极努力工作外，领导机关也应该给企业创造一些条件，帮助他们减少一些可以避免的困难。企业中的“五多”现象，就是这种应当减少的和可以减少的困难之一。齐齐哈尔机车车辆制造厂的厂长最近就发出了这个呼吁。他指出，1955年第一机械工业部和机车工业管理局下达的文件以及各企业来的文件共计7，293件，各种信5，000多件。1955年出差人员有734人，合计13，739天，平均工厂每天有38人在外。会议多得无法估计，以12月份为例：厂长、党委书记、工会主席、团委书记等企业领导人员，等于没有在厂工作，全是在到处开会，加上回来传达讨论等，绝大部分时间都花在会议中了。他要求今后各方面要爱惜时间，以提高工作效率，保证顺利地做到“又多、又快、又好、又省”地完成任务。
    这位厂长的呼吁完全是正当的，各个领导机关要给以支持，切实减少企业中的“五多”。
