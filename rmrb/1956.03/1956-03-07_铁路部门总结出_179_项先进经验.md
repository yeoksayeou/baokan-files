Xinhua News Agency, March 6th—After dispatching 45 work groups to grassroots units of operating railways and new line projects in January and February to help summarize advanced experiences, the Ministry of Railways has recently preliminarily summarized 179 advanced experiences after technical appraisal and systematic sorting.

These advanced experiences are of great significance for completing the railway transportation tasks and new line project tasks of the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and exceeding quotas. The large-scale blasting experience of the Sixth Engineering Bureau of New Railways, when applied to the Qing Shi Yan large-scale blasting project of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, saved more than 670,000 yuan in construction funds at one time and advanced the construction period by 4 months. The chemical defoamer successfully tested by Song Changji and others, associate researchers of the Railway Science Research Institute, was technically appraised as capable of eliminating foaming in locomotive steam and improving steam quality. With the chemical defoamer, each locomotive can pull an additional 150 tons, reduce water consumption by 10%, save fuel by 5%, and increase technical speed by 1.5 kilometers per hour. According to the preliminary promotion plan of the Locomotive Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, 5.28 million yuan can be saved throughout the year.

In the summary work, the Ministry of Railways also paid special attention to adopting the Soviet Kovalev work method, and integrating the advanced experiences of advanced workers in the same type of work, each with its own strengths, into a more complete set of advanced experiences. For example, the "Experience in Saving Fuel" of the locomotive contracting team is a summary of the experiences of seven excellent contracting teams, including Li Shaoqiang and Sun Shigui.

    铁路部门总结出179项先进经验
    据新华社6日讯  铁道部在今年一、二月间派出了45个工作组，到营业铁路和新线工程的基层单位帮助总结先进经验以后，最近，经过铁道部进行技术鉴定和系统整理，已经初步总结出179项先进经验。
    这些先进经验，对提早和超额完成第一个五年计划的铁路运输任务和新线工程任务，都有重大作用。新建铁路第六工程局的大爆破经验，运用在宝成铁路青石岩大爆破工程中，一次节省工程资金67万多元，并且提前工期4个月。铁道科学研究院副研究员宋昌几等试验成功的化学消沫剂，经过技术鉴定认为能消除机车汽水共腾，提高蒸汽品质。用了化学消沫剂，每台机车可以多拉150吨，减少用水量10％，节省燃料5％，每小时能提高技术速度1.5公里。据铁道部机务局初步推行计划，全年可节约528万元。
    铁道部在总结工作中还特别注意采用苏联郭瓦廖夫工作法，把同一工种的先进工作者的各有所长的先进经验综合成更为完整的一套先进经验。如机车包车组的“节约燃料的经验”，是综合了李绍强、孙士贵等7个优秀包车组的经验总结成的。
