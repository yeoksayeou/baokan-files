Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:

    Many advanced producers in industrial and transportation enterprises in Chongqing are actively helping other workers improve their technical skills.
    Chongqing's Special-Class Labor Model Huang Rongchang and the workers in his carpentry workshop are working with workers at the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's quarry to develop a new type of stone-cutting machine. Using this machine to cut large stones into strips of specified sizes can greatly improve efficiency compared to manual operation. The large rolling mill workshop and the refractory materials workshop of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company have established advanced producer schools. Advanced producers from the workshops serve as teachers in the schools, explaining and demonstrating their technical experience to everyone.
    Yang Changbin, an advanced bricklaying worker from the Third Construction Engineering Company of Chongqing, helped bricklaying worker Deng Jixing create a mortar spreader in February. Using this mortar spreader to build one-and-three-brick walls exceeds the national unified quota by more than two times. Chongqing Labor Model and Nantong Coal Mine advanced coal mining worker Lu Changhua has been universally teaching his operating methods to windlass workers in the mining area since the beginning of this year, enabling many workers who originally advanced only a dozen meters per day to now advance thirty or forty meters.

    重庆市许多先进生产者帮助其他工人提高技术
    重庆市工业和交通运输企业的许多先进生产者积极帮助其他工人提高技术水平。
    重庆市特等劳动模范黄荣昌和他所在的木工房的工人，正在和重庆钢铁公司采石场的工人一起研究一种新型锯石机。使用这种机器可以把大石头锯成一定规格的条石，比手工操作的效率要提高许多倍。重庆钢铁公司大型轧钢车间和耐火材料车间举办了先进生产者学校。车间的先进生产者在学校里担任教员，向大家讲解和表演他们的技术经验。
    重庆市第三建筑工程公司先进砌砖工人杨长彬，二月份帮助砌砖工人邓吉星创造了一种铺灰器。用这种铺灰器砌一三墙的效率超过全国统一定额两倍以上。重庆市劳动模范、南桐煤矿先进采煤工人陆昌华今年以来向矿区风镐工人普遍传授了他的操作方法，使许多原来每天掘进十几公尺的工人，现在能够掘进三、四十公尺。
