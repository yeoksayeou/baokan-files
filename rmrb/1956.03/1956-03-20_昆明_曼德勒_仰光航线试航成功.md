Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, March 19th. A trial flight passenger plane of the Civil Aviation Administration of China safely returned to Kunming from Yangon this afternoon. The Kunming-Mandalay-Yangon air route, opened according to the Sino-Burmese Air Transport Agreement, has successfully completed its trial flight.

    The plane flew from Kunming to Yangon on the 15th. Due to good weather along the route and complete navigation equipment, the flight was smooth in both directions. The trial flight also practiced descending through clouds at airports in Mandalay, Lashio, and other places along the route, so as to ensure safe landing even in bad weather.

    The Chinese aviation personnel participating in the trial flight were warmly received by U Kyaw Tun, Director of the Civil Aviation Administration of Burma, Deputy Director U Din Tun, and U Toe, Manager of Burma Airways, and with the close cooperation and assistance of the Burmese aviation personnel, they became familiar with the flight routes, climate characteristics, flight regulations, contact methods, and other flight-related information within Burma.

    The Kunming-Mandalay-Yangon air route is more than 1,000 kilometers long, and the flight time is only four and a half hours. The opening of this air route greatly shortens the spatial distance between China and Burma, providing convenient conditions for further developing the economic and cultural ties between China and Burma and promoting the friendly cooperation between the two peoples. At present, the Civil Aviation Administration of China is making various preparations for the official opening of the route based on the trial flight situation, and is preparing to officially open it to traffic in April.

    昆明——曼德勒——仰光航线试航成功
    新华社昆明19日电　中国民用航空局的一架试航客机今天下午由仰光安全返抵昆明。根据中缅两国航空运输协定开辟的昆明—曼德勒—仰光航线已经试航成功。
    这架飞机是十五日由昆明飞往仰光的。由于沿线天气良好和有完善的导航设备，飞机在往返途中都很顺利。试航机还在航线上的曼德勒、腊戍等地机场试行了穿云下降，以备遇到恶劣天气也能安全降落。
    参加试航的中国航务人员在缅甸受到了缅甸联邦民用航空局局长吴叫吞、副局长吴丁吞和缅甸联邦航空公司经理吴铎的热烈接待，并且在缅甸航务人员的密切合作和帮助下，熟悉了在缅甸境内的飞行路线、气候特征、飞行制度、联系方法和有关飞行的其它资料。
    昆明—曼德勒—仰光航线全长一千多公里，空中飞行时间只需四小时半。这一航线的开辟，大大缩短了中国和缅甸的空间距离，为进一步发展中缅两国的经济和文化连系、促进两国人民的友好合作提供了便利条件。现在，中国民用航空局正在根据试航情况进行正式通航的各种准备工作，预备在四月份正式通航。
