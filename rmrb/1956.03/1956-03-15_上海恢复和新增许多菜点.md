Following joint state-private ownership, many food shops in Shanghai have restored and added dozens of famous dishes. For example, Beijing Wei Restaurant – Nanhua Yan Yun Lou, in addition to restoring the "Yan Yun Chicken," a famous northern dish that had not been served for many years, has also added "Beijing Jarred Meat," famous "Sauce-Fried Diced Lamb" and "Kung Pao Diced Lamb," and a dessert with excellent color, aroma, and taste – "Vegetarian Sweet and Sour Pork." Su Cuisine's Ronghua Restaurant has newly added rare dishes such as "Three-Delicacy Fish Lips," "Braised Four Treasures," and "Phoenix Wing Sea Cucumber." Hangzhou Cuisine's Zhiweiguan also continues to serve famous Hangzhou dishes such as "West Lake Vinegar Fish" and "Dongpo Pork," and will soon add famous dishes such as "Ten Scenes of West Lake." Customers have expressed great satisfaction with the restoration and addition of these local-flavored famous dishes and desserts by these food shops.

    上海恢复和新增许多菜点
    上海市许多饮食商店在公私合营以后，恢复和新增了几十种著名的菜点。如北京味饮食店——南华燕云楼除恢复了多年不供应的北方名菜“燕云鸡”外，还新增了“北京罐子肉”，名“酱炮羊肉丁”和“宫炮羊肉丁”等数种菜和一种色、香、味甚好的点心——“素樱桃肉”。苏馆荣华楼新增加了“三鲜鱼唇”、“味烩四宝”、“凤翼排参”等稀有名菜。杭味知味馆也继续供应杭州名菜“西湖醋鱼”、“东坡肉”，不久还将新增“西湖十景”等名菜。顾客们对于这些饮食商店恢复和新增具有地方风味的名菜和点心，都表示很满意。
