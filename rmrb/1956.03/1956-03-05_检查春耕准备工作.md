    Inspect Spring Plowing Preparations

    The spring plowing season is approaching. Party and government leading organs and agricultural producers' cooperatives in various regions should seize the opportunity to conduct a thorough inspection of the spring plowing preparations, promptly resolve various problems discovered during the inspection, and ensure that each cooperative enters spring plowing production with full preparation.

    The current winter production being carried out throughout the country is better than any previous year. Great achievements have been made in farmland water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, preparation of improved seeds, and other tasks. However, if we conduct a thorough inspection, we will immediately find that in some regions and some units, there are still many problems in the preparations for spring plowing.

    Some regions have done a better job in preparing for cultivation than in previous years, and some local cadres have become proud because of this. They seem to have forgotten that this year's agricultural production targets are set higher than in previous years, by percentages ranging from a dozen to several dozen to more than double. If we do not carry out much more and much better preparatory work than in previous years, such high production increase targets cannot be achieved. There are some regions that have set production increase targets and have also done preparatory work for cultivation, and have done better than in previous years. However, compared with this year's actual needs, the gap is still very large. As of February 15, Baise Prefecture in Guangxi had built water conservancy projects capable of irrigating 119,950 mu of farmland, which is clearly more than in previous years; however, this figure accounts for only slightly more than 16% of the planned irrigation projects to be completed before this year's spring plowing. Lian Sha Township in Pingguo County prepared 13,000 dan of fertilizer for this year's spring plowing production and winter crops, which is not a small figure; however, to complete this year's production plan, it is still necessary to increase it by 60,600 dan. Such examples can be found in other regions. It can be seen that all regions should use this year's higher requirements as a standard, and should not stubbornly adhere to the old yardsticks of the past.

    There are also some regions where the preparation for cultivation is not done well, and even only a hollow production increase target is set, without carrying out any practical and specific work. Dapingpu Township in Xinheng District, Jieyang County, Guangdong Province, plans to produce 1,190 jin of grain per mu this year, which is not a low target. However, the township's wheat fields have suffered from insect pests, and the cadres and farmers have sat idly by and done nothing to save them; more than 90% of the 500 mu of sweet potatoes have been damaged by frost, and no remedial measures have been taken; the fertilizer accumulation work has basically not been started. This is a most dangerous phenomenon and must be thoroughly corrected; otherwise, the so-called production increase target will become empty talk.

    Why does this phenomenon occur in the vigorous winter production campaign? The main reason is that some rural cadres lack a clear understanding and assessment of the current situation of rural work. They think that the vast number of peasants have joined the agricultural producers' cooperatives, and their production enthusiasm is unprecedentedly high, so there is no need to carry out arduous and practical work, and the masses will do everything well. This idea is of course wrong. The agricultural cooperation movement has indeed created extremely favorable conditions for this year's agricultural production. This is the basis for various regions to formulate and achieve higher production increase targets. However, whoever thinks that once the peasants form cooperatives, very high production increase targets will be achieved naturally, this idea is wrong. A large number of cooperatives in most regions were established last winter. The cadres and members of these cooperatives still lack experience in large-scale production. Some policy issues within some cooperatives have not yet been completely resolved. If these cooperatives are rectified and relied upon to carry out spring plowing preparations, it is indeed possible to create amazing results. However, if various problems in the cooperatives are not resolved in a timely manner, it is possible to have phenomena of work stoppages, waste, and no one being responsible, causing losses to the spring plowing preparation work. Therefore, the increase in agricultural cooperatives shows that the responsibilities of cadres at all levels have increased, and have definitely not decreased. They must now take action immediately to rectify the cooperatives well, lead them well, and rely on the cooperatives to carry out the preparatory work for cultivation, and should not have any laissez-faire ideas.

    Production targets are completed by the masses, and they are most concerned about how to achieve production targets and how to carry out the current preparatory work for cultivation. As long as the broad masses are mobilized, various problems will be easily exposed. How to mobilize the masses to inspect the preparatory work for cultivation? The most effective way is to lead them to make careful calculations, and according to the needs of production, check whether the farmland water conservancy is built enough and well, whether the fertilizer is enough and the quality is high, whether the draft cattle have lost weight during the winter, how the training of agricultural technical backbones and the technical teaching work is done, and whether the production plan and labor use plan for the spring plowing stage have been formulated, etc. By comparing the requirements of the preparatory work for cultivation with the requirements of the production targets, problems and loopholes in the preparatory work for cultivation will be immediately discovered. Wu Township in Tuokzake District, Shufu County, Xinjiang, inspected the preparations for improved seeds, fertilizers, and agricultural tools item by item, and found that more than 10,000 jin of improved cotton seeds were needed, but 35% were lacking. And there was a shortage of plows, carts and other agricultural tools. This inspection sobered the minds of the cadres and effectively promoted the current preparatory work for cultivation.

    The spring plowing season is approaching, and time does not allow us to inspect all the problems, and then summarize and solve them. Therefore, we should adopt the method of solving problems as we inspect them, in order to gain time and do more and better preparatory work for cultivation. Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative in Yancheng County, Jiangsu Province, inspected the preparatory work for cultivation and found that more than 2,000 mu of paddy fields were lacking fertilizer, so it organized more than 140 boats to dig mud in Xidang, more than 20 li away; it found that many agricultural tools had not been repaired, so it organized more than 20 people to repair agricultural tools; it found that more than 3,000 jin of Nantet No. 1 improved rice seeds were mixed with local seeds, so it mobilized more than 100 female cooperative members to select the improved seeds. Agricultural technology extension stations in various regions should actively help agricultural cooperatives solve the problems encountered in the preparation for cultivation, and vigorously promote agricultural production increase experience in conjunction with the preparation for cultivation.

    Youth shock brigades are an important force for deeply discovering problems and accelerating the preparation for cultivation. All regions should fully utilize the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of youth on the basis of agricultural cooperation in the preparatory work for cultivation. The youth shock brigade of Sanli Agricultural Cooperative in Chenliu County, Henan Province, improved the well-digging method, and the well-digging efficiency was accelerated from one well every three days to one well every day. The youth shock brigade of Pingxi Township in Laibin County, Guangxi Province, is determined to build the Gutang Reservoir, which was originally planned to be built in 20 days, in 7 days. Without the enthusiasm and vigorous energy of the youth, this speed cannot be achieved.

    Leading cadres at all levels and the broad masses of peasants are full of enthusiasm and confidence in this year's agricultural production, which is a good phenomenon. The current urgent task is to combine enthusiasm with action and carry out the preparatory work for spring plowing in a down-to-earth manner. The more preparations we make, the more guarantee we have for increasing production. Prepare more, prepare well, this is our slogan.

### 检查春耕准备工作

    检查春耕准备工作
    春耕季节就要到来。各个地区的党政领导机关和农业生产合作社，应该抓紧时机，把春耕准备工作进行一次彻底的检查，及时解决检查出来的各种问题，使每个合作社都在有充分准备的情况下进入春耕生产。
    现在全国各地正在进行的冬季生产，比那一年作得都要好。兴修农田水利、积肥、准备优良种子等等工作，都取得了极大的成绩。但是，如果深入地检查，立刻就会发现，在某些地区和某些单位，春耕准备工作中的问题还是很不少的。
    有些地区的备耕工作比往年做得要好，当地一些干部因此骄傲起来了。他们似乎忘记了今年的农业生产指标定的比往年高百分之十几、几十到一倍以上。如果不进行比往年多得多、好得多的备耕工作，这样高的增产指标，当然是不能实现的。有这么一些地区，订出了增产指标，也作了备耕工作，而且作的比往年好。但是，同今年的实际需要比较起来，那就差得很远了。广西百色专区至2月15日兴修了能灌溉119，950亩农田的水利工程，比往年作的显然要多；但是，这个数字同今年春耕前计划要完成的灌溉工程数字相比，却仅占16％强。平果县炼沙乡全乡给今年春耕生产和冬种作物准备了13，000担肥料，这个数字也不算少，但是，要完成今年的生产计划还得增加60，600担。这样的例子，在其他地区也能找到。由此可见，各地都应该用今年较高的要求作标准，而不应该固执地坚持着过去的陈旧的尺子。
    还有某些地区，备耕工作做得很不好，甚至仅仅定出一个空洞的增产指标，根本没有进行切实、具体的工作。广东揭阳县新亨区大坪埔乡计划今年每亩产粮1，190斤，这个指标很不算低。但是，这个乡的麦田遭受虫害，干部和农民坐视不救；500亩番薯被冻伤九成以上，没有采取任何补救办法；积肥工作基本上没有动起来。这是一种最危险的现象，必须把它彻底纠正，否则，所谓增产指标就会成为一句空话。
    在轰轰烈烈的冬季生产运动中，为什么会发生这种现象呢？最主要的原因，在于某些农村干部对于当前的农村工作状况，缺乏清醒的认识和估计。他们以为，广大农民已经参加了农业生产合作社，生产热情空前高涨，不必进行艰苦切实的工作，群众也会把一切事情作的很好。这种想法当然是错误的。农业合作化运动确实给今年的农业生产创造了极为有利的条件。这是各个地区制定和实现较高的增产指标的根据。但是，谁要认为农民一经组成合作社，很高的增产指标自然而然就会实现，这种想法就不对了。多数地区的大量的合作社是在去年冬季建立的。这些合作社的干部和社员还缺乏进行大规模生产的经验。有些合作社内部的若干政策问题还没有彻底地解决。如果把这些合作社都整顿好了，并且紧紧地依靠它进行春耕准备工作，的确可以创造惊人的成绩。但是，如果对合作社中的各种问题不及时加以解决，就有可能发生窝工、浪费、无人负责的现象，给春耕准备工作造成损失。因此，农业合作社增多了，正说明各级干部的责任加重了，绝对不是减轻了。他们现在必须立刻行动起来，把合作社整顿得好好的，领导得好好的，依靠合作社开展备耕工作，而不应该产生任何放任自流的思想。
    生产指标是由群众完成的，他们对如何实现生产指标，怎样进行当前的备耕工作是最关心的。只要把广大群众发动起来，各种问题就容易揭发出来了。怎样发动群众检查备耕工作呢？最有效的办法是领导他们算细帐，根据生产的需要，检查农田水利修的够不够和好不好，肥料够不够和质量高不高，耕牛过冬瘦了没有，训练农业技术骨干和技术传授工作做得怎样，春耕阶段的生产计划和劳动力使用计划制定了没有等等。把备耕工作和生产指标的要求加以对比，立刻就会发现备耕工作中的问题和漏洞。新疆疏附县托克札克区五乡对良种、肥料、农具等准备的情形，逐项进行检查，发现棉花良种需要一万多斤，却缺少35％。并且缺少犁、大车等农具。这次检查清醒了干部的头脑，有力地推动了当前的备耕工作。
    目前已经迫近春耕季节，时间不允许把一切问题检查完了，然后汇总加以解决。因此，应该采取随检查随解决的办法，以便争取时间，把备耕工作做的多些好些。江苏盐城县东方红农业合作社检查备耕工作，发现2，000多亩水田没有肥料，就组织了140多条船到20里以外的西荡挖泥；发现不少农具没有修理，就组织了20多个人修理农具；发现有3，000多斤南特号水稻良种和土种混杂了，就发动100多个女社员把良种挑选出来。各地的农业技术推广站应该积极地帮助农业合作社解决备耕中所遇到的问题，并且结合备耕工作大力推广农业增产经验。
    青年突击队是深入发现问题、加速备耕工作的重要力量。各个地区都应该把广大青年在农业合作化基础上的生产积极性，充分地用到备耕工作中来。河南陈留县三利农业合作社的青年突击队改进了打井方法，打井效率由三天一眼加速到一天一眼。广西来宾县平西乡青年突击队决心在7天里建成原来计划20天建成的沽塘水库。如果没有青年的热情和旺盛的精力，这种速度是不能达到的。
    各级领导干部和广大农民对今年的农业生产充满了热情和信心，这是很好的现象。当前的紧迫任务是把热情和行动结合起来，切切实实地进行春耕准备工作。多作一分准备，就增加一分增产的保证。多多地准备，好好地准备，这就是我们的口号。
