    Resolution of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on Organizing Political and Theoretical Study for Democratic Personages and Industrialists and Businessmen from All Walks of Life
    (Adopted at the 20th Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on March 27, 1956)
    In order to meet the needs of the new political situation in our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation, and to meet the requirements of democratic personages (democratic parties, people's organizations, state organs, democratic personages in the CPPCC committees at all levels, and other patriotic democratic personages) and industrialists and businessmen from all walks of life for political and theoretical study, this conference and local committees at all levels should, according to different objects and local conditions, adopt various methods to organize political and theoretical study for democratic personages and industrialists and businessmen from all walks of life on a voluntary basis.
    (1) The following methods can be adopted for the political and theoretical study of democratic personages from all walks of life:
    (1) Study seminars (study meetings) will continue to be held by this conference and local committees at all levels to organize democratic personages from all walks of life to participate in the study. The content of the study mainly includes current affairs and policy issues.
    (2) Amateur political schools (such as night universities) will be established by this conference and the municipalities directly under the central government, cities where provincial capitals are located, and other municipal CPPCC committees with the conditions to do so, or entrusted to appropriate local universities and cadre schools to establish. Cadres from democratic personages and CPPCC, democratic parties, federations of industry and commerce and other organs are organized to participate in the study. Amateur political schools can successively offer courses in the history of the Chinese revolution, political economy, and philosophy. If conditions permit, two or three courses can be offered at the same time for students to choose from.
    (3) Short-term political schools will be established by the CPPCC provincial committees, or jointly with other organs, or entrusted to appropriate universities and cadre schools, each lasting about half a year, concentrating on absorbing democratic personages from counties and cities to participate, studying basic knowledge of political theory and basic issues of current affairs and policies.
    (4) Socialist academies will be established in Beijing by the CPPCC entrusting the Renmin University of China, absorbing democratic personages (including those in the central and local governments) whose positions or levels are roughly equivalent to those of senior Party school students in batches. Each session is set for one year. The curriculum for the first session is tentatively set as "Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism", "Political Economy" and "History of the Chinese Revolution" as required courses, and other appropriate elective courses can be added. In addition, some important current affairs and policy studies will be organized.
    For democratic personages who meet the conditions for studying at the Socialist Academy but cannot leave their jobs for a long time, a method of leaving their jobs for short-term study (about two months) every year is implemented in a planned way, and courses at the Socialist Academy are selected for self-study according to each person's voluntary choice. Self-study can be organized into groups, and those who do not want to form groups do not have to. When necessary, appropriate guidance should be given to their self-study.
    (5) Democratic personages who hold positions in state organs, schools, and enterprises can choose whether they want to participate in the study organized by this conference and local committees at all levels, or participate in the study organized by their respective organs.
    (6) Family members of democratic personages can participate in the studies listed in items (1), (2), and (3) above, based on possibility and voluntariness.
    (II) The following methods can be adopted for the political and theoretical study of industrialists and businessmen:
    (1) Running short-term training courses as the main way to organize capitalists and their agents to study within two or three years, ensuring that capitalists and their agents who can concentrate on study (including some small business owners who request to participate in the study without hindering the production and operation of the enterprise, some family members of capitalists and family members of capitalist agents who request to participate in the study) can take turns to study once in batches. The training courses offer three courses: 1. Basic knowledge of the laws of social development in the current stage; 2. Basic knowledge of enterprise reform; 3. Important current affairs and policies. Large and medium-sized cities should run such training courses as much as possible. Other cities and counties that need to run such training courses can run them locally, or they can be uniformly run by the cities where the special commissioner's office is located, absorbing capitalists and industrialists and businessmen from the counties and cities under the jurisdiction of the special commissioner's office to participate in the study. The training courses should be jointly or separately organized by the professional bureaus, professional companies, federations of industry and commerce, China Democratic National Construction Association, women's federations, youth federations, etc., under the unified planning and guidance of the CPPCC. For the training courses mainly run by professional bureaus and professional companies, people's organizations such as the China Democratic National Construction Association and the Federation of Industry and Commerce should participate as much as possible; for the training courses mainly run by the Federation of Industry and Commerce, the China Democratic National Construction Association, etc., the professional bureaus or professional companies should participate as much as possible. The training courses can be divided into two or three levels according to the different political and cultural levels of the participants, or they can be ungraded. The study time is set at two to four months per session. The number of classes in each session is determined by each locality according to needs and possibilities.
    (2) Before participating in such short-term training courses, capitalists and their agents can participate in the study of current affairs and policies organized by the Federation of Industry and Commerce or joint ventures, or participate in other appropriate forms of study, which will be handled by the local relevant parties in consideration of the situation. After they have participated in the short-term training courses, further organizing their study can be handled with reference to the following methods: 1. Study current affairs and policies together with the cadres and workers of their enterprises. If the courses in the theoretical study of cadres and workers are suitable for their situation, they should also be absorbed to study together as much as possible. 2. Participate in the amateur political schools held by the local CPPCC to study courses that are suitable for them. 3. Participate in the study classes held for them by the Federation of Industry and Commerce, China Democratic National Construction Association, women's federations, youth federations, etc., to study appropriate subjects. Such study classes can be jointly or separately held.
    (3) For the vast number of small industrialists and businessmen (mainly referring to small industrialists and businessmen engaged in self-production and self-sale, processing and ordering, distribution and consignment, and self-operated small industrialists and businessmen), the Federation of Industry and Commerce will continue to organize them to study in various appropriate ways (including study classes, study groups, report meetings, lecture meetings, etc.). In addition to current affairs and policies, the content of the study can also appropriately increase political common sense courses and business courses. Family members of capitalists and industrialists and businessmen, small business owners, and a small number of capitalists and industrialists and businessmen who cannot participate in short-term training courses can also participate in this type of study.
    (III) For middle and upper-level people scattered in society and some of their family members, the local committees of the CPPCC will, in conjunction with the local organizations of various democratic parties and relevant people's organizations, organize them to study. The content of the study focuses on current affairs and policies, and they can also be organized to participate in political theory study. The study methods can be report meetings, lecture meetings, symposiums, and study group meetings.
    (IV) In the study, focus on adopting the method of free debate to explain the truth. Organize various visits at any time in combination with needs.
    (V) The funds needed to organize the study of democratic personages and middle and upper-level people scattered in society should be included in the budget of this conference and local committees at all levels. The funds needed for the short-term training courses for capitalists and industrialists and businessmen shall be uniformly borne by the professional companies; the funds needed to organize industrialists and businessmen to conduct regular study shall be borne by the Federation of Industry and Commerce.
    Salaries during the period of leaving the job for study shall be paid as usual by the original unit, and the original living conditions shall not be changed.
   (VI) This conference and local committees at all levels shall establish study committees; under the study committees, offices can be established, and in places with more industrialists and businessmen, two offices can be established to handle the study affairs of democratic personages and industrialists and businessmen separately. The study committee shall organize the forces of all relevant parties so that they can properly divide the work and cooperate closely under a unified study plan.
    (VII) The methods for organizing the study of upper-level ethnic minorities should be formulated with reference to the above methods based on their voluntariness and full attention to various different situations and characteristics. In ethnic minority areas, the local leading organs are responsible for formulating them; in general areas, the departments in charge of ethnic affairs shall formulate them in consultation with relevant parties.
