    Pay Attention to Protecting Cultural Relics
    In the process of basic farmland construction, agricultural producers' cooperatives in various parts of Shandong Province have generally been digging up ancient tombs and using the bricks and stones from the tombs to build wells, resulting in the destruction of some important cultural relics. Among the known instances: the famous Han Dynasty tomb of Heng Fang in Qufu County was damaged; the Mingxing Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Zhoujiacun, Yenaan County, dug up eleven ancient tombs in a row, two of which contained murals; Zouping County has destroyed more than a thousand ancient tombs since it began mobilizing for well-digging.
    The relevant departments in Shandong Province have already taken a series of measures to stop this phenomenon, but this issue must still attract everyone's attention. This is because other provinces also have the same problem of damaging cultural relics as Shandong, or the situation is even more serious.

    注意保护文物
    山东省各地农业生产合作社在进行农田基本建设中，普遍发生挖掘古墓并利用古墓中的砖石砌井的行为，结果使一些重要的文物被破坏了。据已经知道的有：曲阜县汉代有名的衡方墓遭到了破坏；掖南县周家村明星农业生产合作社一连扒了十一座古墓，其中两座有壁画；邹平县从发动打井以来，已经扒掉了一千多座古墓。
    山东省有关部门已经采取了一系列措施来制止这种现象，但是这个问题还必须引起大家的注意。因为其它各省也都发生有和山东同样的破坏文物的问题，或者情况更为严重。
