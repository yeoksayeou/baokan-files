To the Editor:

There is a remote mountain village in the northern mountainous region of Fujian. The village is surrounded by high mountains and steep peaks, and the transportation is extremely inconvenient. The villagers have to spend most of the day trekking over mountains to the county seat to buy even a needle and thread. People nearby don't even know the name of this village; everyone just calls it "Rat Hole."

Since the construction of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway began, the face of this village has quickly changed. A newly opened highway connects the village to the county seat, which is 60 li away; trucks loaded with materials come and go on the highway. Soon, a supply and marketing cooperative was established in the village, and workers building the railway and local people flocked here to buy things. Theater troupes and film projection teams also frequently came to the village to perform and show movies. The secluded mountain village has become lively!

In the past, the farmers in this village had no other means of production besides farming. There was a large forest behind the village, but in the past, because of inconvenient transportation, not even half a root was ever sold. After the railway construction began, the farmers here transported large quantities of cut timber, firewood, and long-accumulated shiitake mushrooms, dried bamboo shoots, and other local specialties to the construction site for sale. Poor peasant Huang Shiji earned nearly 100 yuan just from selling firewood and logging wages. Last winter, he and his wife each made a cotton coat and a set of new clothes, and also added a new quilt. Over the past year, many houses have been built in this village, and every household has also added some new furniture.

These facts have made the farmers in the village deeply realize the benefits that railway construction has brought them, and have also made them see more clearly the bright future of socialism. Last winter, an agricultural producers' cooperative was established in the village, and 19 out of 20 peasant households became members of the agricultural cooperative. In order to continue to support railway construction, in addition to actively responding to this year's grain production increase movement of 40%, the cooperative members also raised 21 pigs and expanded the planting of vegetables by more than 4 mu.

The five households that moved away from the village a year ago have recently moved back one after another. Farmer He Xishui said happily: Since the railway construction began, our "Rat Hole" has changed; in the future, when the railway is completed and the train comes, life will be even better!

### 一个偏僻山村的变化

    一个偏僻山村的变化编辑同志：
    福建北部山区有个偏僻的山村，村子的四周都是高山峻岭，交通十分闭塞。村里的人要买一针一线，也要化上大半天工夫，翻山越岭到县城去。附近的人们都不知道这个村子的名字，大家就把它叫做“老鼠洞”。
    鹰厦铁路动工以后，这个村子的面貌很快起了变化。一条新开辟的公路，把这个村子同相隔60里的县城连接起来了；满载着物资的汽车在公路上来来往往。不久，村子里建立了供销合作社，修筑铁路的工人和当地群众川流不息地到这里来买东西。剧团和电影队也经常到村里演出和放映。僻静的山村热闹起来了！
    以前，这个村子的农民除了耕田以外，没有其他生产门路。村子后面有一大片林木，过去因为交通不便，半根也没有出卖过。铁路动工以后，这里的农民把砍伐下来的木料、木柴，以及长年积压下来的香菇、笋干等土、特产，大量地运到工地出售。贫农黄仕吉，单是卖木柴和伐木的工钱，就收入将近100元。去年冬天，他夫妻俩每人做了一件棉衣、一套新衣裳，还添了一床新被子。一年来，这个村子里修盖了不少房子，每家每户还都添置了一些新家具。
    这些事实，使村里的农民深刻地体会到修铁路给他们带来的好处，也使他们更加看清了社会主义的美好前途。去年冬天，村子里建立了一个农业生产合作社，20户农民中，有19户成为农业社的社员。社员们为了继续支援铁路建设，除了积极响应今年增产四成的粮食增产运动以外，还养了21头猪，扩种了4亩多蔬菜。
    一年前从村里搬走的5户人家，最近也陆续搬回来了。农民何细水高兴地说：铁路动工修建以后，我们这个“老鼠洞”已经变了样；将来铁路修好了，火车开来，日子就更好过啦！
