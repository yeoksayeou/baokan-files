    Don't Casually Merge "Lianjiapu" Shops
    When Hengyang City, Hunan Province, was adjusting its commercial network, it merged some "lianjiapu" shops. The tea industry even stipulated that family members of husband-and-wife stores should move out of the stores by the end of January. The original owners had to find other houses to live in and pay moving expenses. Therefore, many husband-and-wife stores were dissatisfied with the store mergers.
    This practice is clearly wrong. Husband-and-wife stores are a form of small shop with a wide distribution and close proximity to residents, selling a variety of goods. They can do business at any time and even deliver goods, playing a certain role in facilitating the needs of the masses. Many husband-and-wife stores rely on the auxiliary labor of family members: the husband goes out to purchase goods, and the wife takes care of the store at home; children also help with the business when they come home from school. If they are all merged and centralized inappropriately, it will not only deprive them of the auxiliary labor of their families, but also increase the difficulty of finding houses and the expenses of moving, bringing difficulties to the lives of the husband-and-wife store families. More importantly, it will lose the inherent advantage of conveniently meeting the needs of the masses. Therefore, all localities should prevent this phenomenon from happening.

    不要随便合并连家铺
    湖南省衡阳市在调整商业网的时候，合并了一些连家铺，茶叶业还规定夫妻店的家属要在1月底搬离商店。原来的业主要搬家就得另外找房子住，还需要搬家费。因此，很多夫妻店对并店都不满。
    这种做法显然是错误的。夫妻店是小商店中的一种形式，它的分布面很宽，和居民很接近，出售的商品很零星；随时可以做生意，还可以送货，对便利群众需要起一定的作用。很多夫妻店都依靠家属的辅助劳动，丈夫出去进货，妻子在家照料店务；孩子放学回家也帮助做买卖。如果不适当地把他们一律合并、集中，不但会使他们失去家属的辅助劳动、还要增加找房子的困难和搬家费用的支出，给夫妻店家属生活带来了困难。更重要的是会失去他们固有的便利群众需要的好处。因此，各地应该防止这种现象的发生。
