Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 8th: The Afghan Embassy in India issued a press release on March 8th stating: "Any decision that does not consider the rights and goals of the people of Pakhtunistan, regardless of its nature, will be of no value to them."

The press release was issued in light of the Manila Treaty Organization Council's discussion of the "Pakhtunistan" issue, which is in dispute between Afghanistan and Pakistan.

The communiqué said: "We find it necessary to state again that no assembly and no political alliance is qualified to violate the will and aspirations of the people themselves, to decide their fate, or to discuss matters concerning them against their will."

The communiqué stated: "Afghanistan supports the rights and demands of the people of Pakhtunistan, and it will consider such decisions to be of no value and will not change its position because of these decisions."

    阿富汗驻印大使馆就巴克同尼斯坦问题发表公报
    新华社新德里8日电　阿富汗驻印度大使馆3月8日发表新闻公报说：“任何不考虑维护巴克同尼斯坦人民的权利和目标的决定，不管性质如何，对他们说来都将是没有任何价值的。”
    这项新闻公报是鉴于马尼拉条约组织理事会讨论阿富汗同巴基斯坦有争端的“巴克同尼斯坦”问题而发表的。
    公报说：“我们认为有必要再次声明，任何集会和任何政治联盟都没有资格违反人民自己的意愿和愿望，决定他们的命运，或者是违反他们的意愿，讨论有关他们的问题。”
    公报表示：“阿富汗支持巴克同尼斯坦人民的权利和要求，它将认为这种决定是毫无价值的，并且不会由于这些决定而改变它的立场。”
