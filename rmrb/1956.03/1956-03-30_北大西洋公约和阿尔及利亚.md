    The North Atlantic Treaty and Algeria
    Just as progressive public opinion around the world is unanimously urging the French government to seek a solution to the Algerian question through peaceful means, in accordance with the principles of respecting national self-determination and recognizing the actual existence of the Algerian state, a solution that conforms to both the national aspirations of the Algerian people and the national interests of the French people, the North Atlantic Council issued a communiqué on March 27, claiming that Algeria is part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization area and emphasizing Algeria's importance to the North Atlantic Group. The ill-intentioned move by the North Atlantic Council has once again made the colonial nature of this group evident to people.
    Whether it is historical fact or the current situation, it fully proves that Algeria is not a province of France. The resolution of the Bandung Conference solemnly declared that the peoples of Asia and Africa recognize that the Algerian people should enjoy the right to self-determination and independence. French Prime Minister Mollet also admitted earlier this month: "Considering the fact that eight million Muslims live in Algeria, that country cannot be regarded as a province of France like, for example, Normandy or Artois." Therefore, just as Morocco and Tunisia cannot be part of the North Atlantic Group area, Algeria can by no means be included in the scope of this military group.
    The intention of the North Atlantic Council in issuing such a statement at such a time is very clear. It wants to support the absurd claim that "Algeria is France," thereby denying the Algerian people's right to national self-determination, affirming colonial rule in Algeria, and facilitating further attacks on the Algerian national independence movement. Now people see more clearly that the purpose of this military group, which is mainly organized by colonial countries, is actually to prop up the collapsing colonial system.
    However, the decision-makers of the North Atlantic Group do not necessarily think solely for the colonial interests of France. They simply believe that places with important strategic significance like Algeria must be kept under the control of the North Atlantic Group's war and colonial forces, so that they can use Algeria's bases, manpower, and strategic resources to serve their strategic plans. That is why they agreed some time ago to France's withdrawal of tens of thousands of troops from West Germany to reinforce the colonial army in Algeria. This is also why the United States has been supplying weapons to the French colonial army to massacre the people of Algeria who are demanding independence. If one pays attention to the remarks made by the U.S. Ambassador to France, Dillon, a few days ago, it is not difficult to understand whose intentions the recent communiqué issued by the North Atlantic Council was acting upon. According to American newspapers, some people in Washington are planning to pull Morocco and Tunisia, which have just embarked on the road to independence, into the North Atlantic Group. This shows how strong the interest of the aggressive forces across the ocean is in North Africa.
    Therefore, for France, the true value of this kind of "support" from the North Atlantic Group is also highly doubtful. This is not only because this kind of "support" is not conducive to seeking a solution to the Algerian question through negotiations that conforms to the interests of the people of both countries, but also because it contains a cunning intention to make France play the foolish role of "pulling chestnuts out of the fire" for others. There is a precedent for this. France received a lot of enthusiastic support from the United States in Indochina, but as a result, even French Foreign Minister Pineau said that the situation in South Vietnam is now that "the United States is trying its best to squeeze France out and benefit itself."
    In any case, Algeria is Algeria, and the Algerian people's right to national self-determination cannot be obliterated.

    北大西洋公约和阿尔及利亚
    正当全世界进步舆论一致敦促法国政府按照尊重民族自决权利和承认阿尔及利亚国家实际存在的原则，用和平方法对阿尔及利亚问题求得既符合阿尔及利亚人民的民族愿望，也符合于法国人民的民族利益的解决的时候，北大西洋集团理事会三月二十七日发表了一项公报，声称阿尔及利亚是北大西洋公约组织地区的一部分，并且大谈其阿尔及利亚对北大西洋集团的重要性。北大西洋集团理事会这种居心不良的举动，使人们又一次明显地看到这个集团的殖民主义性质。
    不管是历史事实或者现实情况都充分证明了阿尔及利亚不是法国的省份。万隆会议的决议曾经庄严地宣布，亚洲和非洲的人民认定阿尔及利亚人民应享有自决和独立权利。法国总理摩勒本月初也曾承认：“按照有八百万伊斯兰教徒居住在阿尔及利亚的事实，那个国家不能像例如诺曼底或阿多瓦之类被认为是法国的一省。”因此，正如摩洛哥和突尼斯不能是北大西洋集团地区的一部分一样，阿尔及利亚也决不能被划入这个军事集团范围之中。
    北大西洋集团理事会在这样的时候发表这样的声明，其用意是十分明显的。它是想这样来支持那种所谓“阿尔及利亚就是法国”的荒谬说法，从而否定阿尔及利亚人民的民族自决权利，肯定在阿尔及利亚的殖民统治，便于进一步打击阿尔及利亚的民族独立运动。现在人们看得更加明白，这一个以殖民国家为主体组织的军事集团的目的实际上是支撑瓦解中的殖民制度。
    不过，北大西洋集团的决策者倒不见得是单纯为着法国的殖民利益着想。他们只是认为像阿尔及利亚这样具有重要战略意义的地方必须保持在北大西洋集团的战争和殖民势力的掌握之中，以便于他们利用阿尔及利亚的基地、人力和战略资源为他们的战略计划服务。这就是为什么他们前些时候同意法国从西德抽调了好几万驻军去增援阿尔及利亚的殖民军队。这也就是为什么美国一直在以武器供给法国的殖民军队，用来对阿尔及利亚要求独立的人民进行屠杀。人们如果注意到几天之前美国驻法国大使狄龙曾经发表过的谈话，就更不难明白，北大西洋集团理事会最近发表的公报是遵照什么人的意旨行事的了。据美国报纸报道，华盛顿有人正打算把刚刚走上独立道路的摩洛哥和突尼斯拉进北大西洋集团。这说明大洋彼岸的侵略势力对于北非怀有着多么浓厚的兴趣。
    因此对于法国来说，北大西洋集团的这种“支持”的真正价值也是大可怀疑的。这不仅因为这种“支持”不利于通过谈判来对阿尔及利亚问题求得符合于两国人民的利益的解决，而且因为它还包含着一种使法国扮演替别人“从火中取栗”的愚笨角色的狡猾意图。这是有前车可鉴的。法国在印度支那曾经从美国得到过不少热情的支持，但是结果，连法国外交部长比诺也说，现在在南越的情况是“美国竭力排挤法国而利于自己”。
    不论怎样，阿尔及利亚就是阿尔及利亚，阿尔及利亚人民的民族自决权利是不容抹煞的。
