Reactions to Jordan's Dismissal of Glubb
    People in the Jordanian Capital Continue to Demonstrate

    Amman Dispatch: About 15,000 people in Amman, the capital of Jordan, continued to demonstrate on March 4, expressing their welcome for the Jordanian King's measure to dismiss the British officer Glubb.
    This was the largest of the marches held for three consecutive days since the announcement of the measure on March 2. Soldiers of the Arab Legion and government staff also participated in the demonstration. Demonstrators sang and danced in the streets, chanting slogans such as "Down with Imperialism!" "Long Live Arab Unity!" and slogans against Glubb.
    Jordanian newspapers have published commentaries criticizing Glubb. "Al Jihad" accused Glubb of causing division in Jordan, saying, "He interfered in the affairs of the people, regardless of whether these affairs were within his authority."

    Arab Countries Generally Express Welcome

    People in Cairo, Egypt, and other Arab countries expressed satisfaction with the news of Glubb's dismissal. The Deputy Secretary-General of the Arab League, Bellama, said on March 2 that this action "liberates the Arab Legion from foreign influence," so that "the Arab Legion can better cooperate fully with other Arab armies."
    Syrian Defense Minister Bourmeda said that the removal of Glubb was "pleasing news." Meanwhile, people from all walks of life in Damascus believe that Glubb's removal is a "huge national event" that will have a far-reaching impact on Arab countries.

    British Newspapers Admit it is a Failure of Britain in the Middle East

    The reaction of the British newspapers has made it undoubtedly clear that the Jordanian King's and Jordanian government's decision to dismiss Glubb is considered another huge failure of British policy in the Middle East. The "Times" regarded the dismissal of General Glubb as an "ominous event" because, according to the "Times," Glubb "was the embodiment of Britain's former hegemony in the Middle East." The "Manchester Guardian" worried that the dismissal of General Glubb would make the Baghdad Pact even more precarious.
    The political commentator of "The Observer" wrote that General Glubb was "a symbol of the past imperialist era in the relationship between Britain and the Arab world." The newspaper linked the Jordan incident to the breakdown of the Cyprus negotiations, and wrote, "These two events are manifestations of a broader crisis in the West's entire policy in the Middle East. They once again show that Western countries, especially Britain, should thoroughly revise their policy direction towards the Middle East so as not to keep up with the rapidly changing political situation in the region." The newspaper went on to point out that it is becoming increasingly clear that policies based on "military deterrence" are no longer viable.
    The "Sunday Times" also believes that Glubb's dismissal is a sign of the failure of British diplomacy in the Middle East.
    "The World News" pointed out, "Obviously, the past era in the Middle East is over." The newspaper advocated that Western countries carefully revise their policies.
    Some bourgeois newspapers also published threatening remarks about Jordan. The "Daily Telegraph and Morning Post" demanded "action" to maintain Britain's position in the Middle East. The "Manchester Guardian" called for joint "British-American action" in the Middle East. London and Washington are holding emergency consultations to study how to prevent the "complete bankruptcy" of the Anglo-American plan in the Middle East, which is to use certain Arab countries as military bridgeheads. The "Daily Mail" pointed out when talking about this matter that London is considering sending new reinforcements to reinforce the British armed forces stationed in the Middle East.

    Burmese Newspapers Welcome Jordan's Decision

    The English-language newspaper "The Guardian," which was recently founded in Yangon, published an editorial on March 4, saying: The Jordanian King's dismissal of Glubb, commander of the Arab Legion, is a natural result of major powers forcing small countries to accept their policies and exerting pressure.
    After criticizing the British and American policy of piecing together military blocs in the Middle East, the editorial praised the Soviet Union's foreign policy in the Middle East. The editorial said that the Soviet Union did not require any country to participate in military blocs. "Its economic assistance is mainly provided on the basis of barter trade."

    关于约旦解除格拉布职务的反应
    约旦首都人民继续游行示威
    安曼消息：约旦首都安曼约15，000人在3月4日继续举行游行示威，表示欢迎约旦国王解除英籍军官格拉布的职务的措施。
    这是从3月2日宣布这个措施以来连续第三天举行的游行中规模最大的一次。阿拉伯军团的士兵和政府工作人员也参加了游行示威。示威的人在街上歌唱和舞蹈，他们高呼“打倒帝国主义！”“阿拉伯团结万岁！”以及反对格拉布的口号。
    约旦报纸纷纷发表评论抨击格拉布。“吉哈德报”指责格拉布使约旦陷于分裂，“他干涉人民的事务，不管这些事务是不是在他的权限之下。”
    阿拉伯国家普遍表示欢迎
    开罗的埃及和其它阿拉伯国家的人士对格拉布被解职的消息表示满意。阿拉伯联盟副秘书长贝拉马在3月2日说，这个行动“把阿拉伯军团从外国影响下解放出来”，这样，“阿拉伯军团可以更好地同其他阿拉伯军队进行充分的合作”。
    叙利亚国防部长伯尔迈达说，撤除格拉布的职务是一件“令人高兴的消息”。同时，大马士革各界人士认为，格拉布被撤职是一个会对阿拉伯国家发生深远影响的“巨大的全民事件”。
    英报承认是英国在中东的失败
    英国报纸的反应已经使人可以毫无疑问地看出，约旦国王和约旦政府把格拉布免职的决定被认为是英国政策在中东的又一次巨大的失败。“泰晤士报”把格拉布将军被解职一事看成是“不祥的事件”，因为，照“泰晤士报”说，格拉布“就是英国在中东昔日的霸权的化身”。“曼彻斯特卫报”担心，格拉布将军的免职将使巴格达条约更为摇摇欲坠。
    “观察家报”的政治评论员写道，格拉布将军曾经是“在英国同阿拉伯世界的关系中过去的帝国主义时代的象征”。这家报纸把约旦事件同塞浦路斯谈判破产联系起来，它写道，“这两件事是西方在中东的整个政策遭到更广泛的危机的表现。它们再度表明，西方国家，特别是英国，应当彻底修改自己对中东的政策方针，以免跟不上这个地区迅速变化的政治情况。”报纸接着指出，事情越来越明显，“以军事威慑”为基础的政策不再行得通了。
    “星期日泰晤士报”也认为格拉布的被免职是英国外交在中东失败的标志。
    “世界新闻报”指出，“显然，以往的时代在中东结束了。”这家报纸主张西方国家慎重地修改政策。
    一些资产阶级报纸同时还发表了威胁约旦的议论。“每日电讯与晨邮报”要求采取“行动”以保持英国在中东的地位。“曼彻斯特卫报”要求在中东采取联合的“英美行动”。伦敦和华盛顿正在举行紧急磋商，研究如何防止英美在中东的计划的“完全破产”，这一计划就是利用某些阿拉伯国家作为军事桥头堡的计划。“每日邮报”在谈到这件事时指出，伦敦正在考虑派遣新的增援部队去增援驻在中东的英国武装部队。
    缅甸报纸欢迎约旦的决定
    最近在仰光创刊的英文报纸“卫报”在3月4日发表社论说：约旦国王解除阿拉伯军团司令格拉布的职务，这是大国硬要小国接受它们的政策而施加压力的一种自然结果。
    社论在批评了英美在中东拼凑军事集团的政策以后，赞扬苏联在中东的外交政策。社论说，苏联没有要求任何一个国家参加军事集团。“它的经济援助主要是在易货贸易的基础上给予的。” （据新华社讯）
