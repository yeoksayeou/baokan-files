    Educate Peasants Not to Let Their Children Drop Out of School

    Editor's Note: The following two letters reflect the situation of a large number of peasant children dropping out of school in some areas. This is a serious problem and should attract the attention of relevant leading organs. The cause of socialist construction needs a large number of people with high cultural and scientific knowledge. To improve agricultural production and build a new socialist countryside, on the one hand, we should change the relations of production by developing cooperatives; on the other hand, we must also carry out a series of technical reforms in agricultural production, such as promoting new agricultural tools, using chemical fertilizers, improving soil, eliminating pests and diseases, and building water conservancy projects. In the future, we will also implement the mechanization of agriculture. To do these tasks well, it is impossible without people with certain cultural and scientific knowledge, and such talents will mainly be cultivated from peasant children. Therefore, some peasants allowing their children to drop out of school midway not only affects the state's education plan, but is also detrimental to the long-term interests of the peasants themselves. It is hoped that local and township leading organs and educational administrative departments will patiently explain these principles to the peasants, educate them to let their children persist in learning, master more knowledge, and prepare to work better after completing their studies; those who are truly economically difficult should also be properly resolved according to the specific circumstances. In addition, the Ministry of Education should quickly study this issue and formulate a unified solution.

(I) To the Editor:

    At the end of last semester, 232 students from 19 secondary schools in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, suspended or dropped out of school. After the start of this semester, students continued to request to drop out. As of February 24, according to statistics from 5 secondary schools, a total of 295 students had not reported. Similar situations also exist in various primary schools.

    The vast majority of these students requesting to drop out are children of peasants. Because some districts and townships did not clearly explain in the publicity of the agricultural cooperativization movement that the countryside needs people with higher cultural knowledge and scientific technology in the process of socialist construction, some peasants let their children drop out of school and return home to participate in agricultural production in order to earn more work points. Some rural cadres and cooperative cadres also did not consider the long-term interests well. Some cooperatives sent travel expenses to allow students to return to the community as accountants, and some township cadres personally went to the school to request the school to allow them to drop out. In addition, some agricultural cooperatives did not help individual farmers solve their economic difficulties, and some factories and basic construction departments casually recruited workers in rural areas, which are also reasons why some students requested to drop out.

    The above situation has attracted the attention of the Zhengzhou Municipal People's Committee. On March 2, the Zhengzhou Municipal People's Committee issued instructions requiring the education department and district and township governments to immediately solve this problem. However, judging from the current situation, the trend of students suspending and dropping out of school has not stopped. It is understood that similar phenomena also exist in many parts of the country. Therefore, I hope that relevant departments will immediately take effective measures to solve this problem.

(II) To the Editor:

    At the end of last semester, a total of 74 students from 11 primary schools in Nanyuan District, Beijing, requested to drop out of school. The age of these students is generally around thirteen or fourteen years old, the oldest is only 18 years old, and some are only seven or eight years old. After the district, township people's committees, and school leaders educated the parents of the students, the situation improved somewhat; however, to date, there are still 30 students who have not returned to school.

    Why does this phenomenon occur? The main reason is that some peasants, after joining advanced agricultural production cooperatives, believe that land is no longer divided, and only by investing more labor can they earn more wage points. Therefore, they let their children drop out of school and return home, the older children directly participate in agricultural production, and the younger children stay at home to cook and take care of the babies, allowing their mothers to work more in the community. Their reason is: the family has financial difficulties, and the children cannot afford to study; but the actual situation is not like this at all. For example, Wang Guiying, a fourth-grade student at Shilihe Primary School, is only 13 years old this year, and her family has asked her to drop out of school. Her family has a total of 5 people. Her father is estimated to earn at least 1,800 points a year, and her mother can earn at least 600 points a year in addition to managing household chores. Life is very good. Of course, there are also individual students who drop out of school because their families have fewer laborers and have more difficult lives; however, the community should give appropriate care to these poor members, and it is not good to adopt the method of letting children drop out of school.

    The situation of students dropping out of school midway is contrary to the requirements of our country's socialist construction. As far as I know, there are such situations in other parts of the country. Therefore, I suggest that the Ministry of Education quickly take concrete measures to solve this problem.

### 教育农民不要让子弟中途退学

    教育农民不要让子弟中途退学
    编者按：下面发表的两封来信，反映了某些地区农民子弟大量退学的情况。这是一个严重的问题，应该引起有关领导机关的重视。社会主义建设事业，需要大量有高度文化水平和科学知识的人。要提高农业生产，建设社会主义的新农村，一方面应该通过发展合作社改变生产关系；另一方面还必须进行一系列的农业生产的技术改革，像推广新式农具、使用化学肥料、改良土壤、消灭病虫害、兴修水利等等，而在将来还要实行农业的机械化。要做好这些工作，没有具有一定文化科学知识的人是不行的，而这样的人才，主要的将从农民子弟中来培养。因此，某些农民让他们的子弟中途退学，不但对国家教育计划有影响，而且对农民自己的长远利益也是不利的。希望各地区、乡领导机关和教育行政部门耐心地向农民说清楚这些道理，教育他们让子女坚持学习，掌握更多的知识，准备学习结束以后更好地工作；对那些经济上真正比较困难的，也应该分别情况予以妥善解决。此外，教育部应该迅速研究这个问题，制定统一的解决办法。		（一）编辑同志：
    上学期末，河南省郑州市19个中等学校中有232个学生休学和退学了。这个学期开学以后，学生要求退学的情况仍继续发生。到2月24日为止，根据5个中等学校的统计，还没有报到的学生共295人。在各个小学也有类似的情况。
    这些要求退学的学生，绝大部分是农民的子弟。由于有些区、乡在农业合作化运动的宣传中，没有讲清农村在社会主义建设的过程中需要有较高的文化知识和科学技术的人，因而一部分农民为了多得工分，就让孩子退学回家去参加农业生产。有些农村干部和合作社干部也没有很好考虑长远的利益，有的合作社就寄路费来让学生回去当社里的会计，有的乡干部亲自到学校去要求校方允许退学。此外，有些农业社没有帮助个别农民解决经济上的困难，有些工厂和基本建设部门随便到农村去招收工人，也是某些学生要求退学的原因。
    上述情况，已经引起郑州市人民委员会的重视。3月2日，郑州市人民委员会发出指示，要求教育部门和区、乡政府立即解决这个问题。但是，从目前的情况看，学生休学和退学的趋势仍然没有停止。据了解全国很多地区也有类似的现象。因此，我希望有关部门立即采取有效措施，来解决这个问题。

            （二）编辑同志：
    上学期末，北京市南苑区11个小学共有74个学生要求退学。这些学生的年龄一般在十三、四岁左右，最大的才18岁，个别的还有七、八岁的。经过区、乡人民委员会和学校领导对学生家长进行了教育，情况有所好转；但是，到目前为止，仍然有30个学生没有回到学校里来。
    为什么会发生这样的现象呢？主要原因是某些农民加入了高级农业生产合作社以后，认为土地不分红了，只有多投入劳动力，才可以多得工资分。因此，他们就让孩子退学回家，大孩子直接参加农业生产，小孩子留在家里做饭、带娃娃，让妈妈多在社里干活。他们的理由是：家庭生活困难，孩子念不起书了；但是实际情况根本不是这样。像十里河小学四年级学生王桂英，今年才13岁，家里就让她退学了。他家共5口人，父亲估计一年最少能挣1，800分，母亲除了操作家务以外，每年最低也能挣600分，生活是过得很好的。当然，也有个别退学的学生家里劳动力少，生活比较困难；但是社里对这些贫困的社员应该给予适当照顾，采用让孩子退学这种办法也是不好的。
    学生中途退学的情况，是和我们国家的社会主义建设的要求相违背的。据我所知，全国其他各地也有这样的情况。因此，我建议教育部迅速采取具体措施，来解决这一问题。
