To the Editorial Board:

Last year, the Construction Department of the Qu County Government in Zhangtan Township, Zhejiang Province, lent 2,700 jin of cotton seeds, which were planted on 2,700 mu of land. However, only 20% of the seeds sprouted, wasting a lot of manpower and animal power. Later, most of these fields were replanted with millet and sesame, but because the time was delayed, one crop of "June beans" was missed. Calculating at 90 jin per mu, the township lost more than 24,000 jin of "June beans." In March of this year, the Quzhou Prefectural Seed Management Station lent 3,690 jin of millet seeds to the township. As a result, only 50% to 60% of the seeds sprouted after planting. According to the farmers, the reason for the uneven sprouting of these two seed loans was that most of the seeds had deteriorated and rotted, losing their ability to grow. This shows that the Construction Department of the Qu County Government and the Quzhou Prefectural Seed Management Station still have problems in the work of lending seeds. I suggest that in the future, relevant agencies in various places should first carefully and meticulously conduct scientific inspections when purchasing seeds; strictly prevent water and insect erosion during storage and transportation; and when lending, they should also explain the characteristics and planting methods of various seeds to the masses in detail. Only in this way can we prevent the loss of state property and the people in production.

### 浙江衢县人民政府建设科等  应重视保管和贷放种籽工作

    浙江衢县人民政府建设科等
    应重视保管和贷放种籽工作
    编辑同志：去年浙江衢县漳潭乡由县政府建设科贷给棉种二千七百斤，种植了二千七百亩地，结果只有百分之二十出了苗，浪费了很多人力、畜力。后来这些地又大部分改种谷子和芝麻，但因为时间迟了，中间就少种了一熟“六月豆”，以每亩产九十斤计算，全乡共损失“六月豆”二万四千多斤。今年三月，该乡由衢州专署种籽管理站贷给谷种三千六百九十斤，结果种了以后，只有百分之五、六十出了苗。这二次贷种出苗不齐的原因，据农民反映是这些种籽大部已经败坏霉烂，失去了生长能力。这说明衢县县政府建设科和衢州专区种籽管理站在贷放种籽工作中还是存在着问题的。我建议今后各地有关机关在贷放种籽工作中，首先在选购时必须认真细心地加以科学的检验；保管和运输时必须严密防止水、虫的侵蚀；贷放时，还应向群众详细解释各种种籽的特性与种植法。这样才不致使国家资财和群众在生产中受到损失。徐日芳
