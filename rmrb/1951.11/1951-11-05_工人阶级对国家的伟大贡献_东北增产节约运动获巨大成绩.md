    The Working Class's Great Contribution to the Nation
    The Northeast's Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement Achieves Great Results
    The increase production and practice economy movement in state-owned factories and mines in the Northeast region has now achieved great results. The total number of increase production and practice economy plans in various factories and mines has increased to 11.36 million tons of grain. As of the end of August, the factories and mines under the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government had increased production and practiced economy, creating wealth equivalent to more than 4.267 million tons of grain for the country. The plan of various state-owned factories in Shenyang to increase production and practice economy by 2 million tons of grain had completed 1.4 million tons by the end of September, of which 14 factories exceeded the state's assigned tasks by an average of 10 percent. Shenyang Smelting Plant, Electrical Engineering No. 8 Factory, Machine No. 2 Factory, Factory 53, Machine No. 4 Factory, and Electrical Engineering No. 6 Factory have all completed their annual increase production and practice economy tasks. The employees of each factory have also proposed new goals, determined to create more wealth for the country before the end of the year.
    These achievements were obtained after enterprise leading cadres relied on the broad masses of employees, through vigorous publicity, tapping potential, finding shortcuts, formulating plans, signing contracts, and organizing competitions. In May of this year, Chairman Gao Gang called on the working class in the Northeast to accelerate capital turnover, reduce costs, and increase equipment utilization rates, to increase production and practice economy by 5 million tons of grain for the country in addition to completing the state's original production plan. Initially, this policy was not grasped by the leading cadres of all departments, resulting in deviations such as simply accelerating capital turnover and handling stagnant materials in some enterprises. In September, the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held a symposium, which criticized this phenomenon and deepened the movement. All factories and mines organized employees to conduct in-depth study, mobilized employees to launch movements to tap potential, promote advanced working methods, and find shortcuts. After these movements, the increase production and practice economy plans of general factories and mines exceeded the tasks assigned by the higher authorities. A certain factory in Shenyang received a task of 30,000 tons from the higher authorities. The factory department thought it could complete 35,000 tons during the discussion, but after discussion by the masses, it took the initiative to propose to complete 43,930 tons. After the No. 8 Factory of the Northeast Clothing Bureau launched a potential tapping movement, it exceeded the original plan to increase production by 500 tons by 34 times.
    After formulating plans, the employees of each factory launched a labor competition movement in conjunction with the patriotic convention. In Shenyang alone, as of September 17, more than 120 units in the machinery, light industry, chemical, textile, and electrical engineering industries had participated in the competition. Many factories and mines also signed collective contracts, workshop liaison contracts, and group conventions to ensure the completion of the increase production and practice economy plans. Jiao Qingxiang, a worker at the No. 5 Paper Mill, did not leave the kiln for seven days and seven nights in order to install the roasting furnace. Li Jingkun, a technician at a certain mining machinery factory, transformed the milling cutter and increased work efficiency by 24 times. After promoting this advanced operation method, the output of each milling machine can increase production and practice economy by 466 tons of grain for the country in the last four months of this year. After the workers of the Shenyang Smelting Plant formulated a collective contract, they put forward more than 1,000 rationalization proposals, and continuously created 24 new records in August and September. The factory has completed its annual increase production plan three months ahead of schedule, and decided to increase production and practice economy by more than 32,000 tons of grain for the country in the fourth quarter.

    工人阶级对国家的伟大贡献
    东北增产节约运动获巨大成绩
    东北区国营厂矿企业的增产节约运动，现已获得巨大成绩。各厂矿增产节约计划总数，已增至一千一百三十六万吨粮食。到八月底为止，东北人民政府工业部所属厂矿，已给国家增产节约了价值四百二十六万七千余吨粮食的财富。沈阳市各国营工厂增产节约二百万吨粮食的计划，到九月底已完成一百四十万吨，其中十四个工厂，平均超过了国家分配任务的百分之十。沈阳冶炼厂、电工八厂、机器二厂、五三工厂、机器四厂、电工六厂等，均已先后完成了全年增产节约任务。各厂职工并纷纷提出新的奋斗目标，决在年底以前再为国家创造更多的财富。
    这些成绩，是企业领导干部依靠广大职工，经过了大力宣传，发掘潜力，找窍门，订出计划，订合同，组织竞赛等措施之后获得的。今年五月，高岗主席号召东北工人阶级以加速资金周转、降低成本、提高设备利用率等办法，在完成国家原订生产计划之外，再为国家增产节约五百万吨粮食的财富。起初，这一方针并未为所有部门的领导干部所掌握，因而在某些企业中，产生了单纯加速资金周转和处理呆滞材料等偏向。九月间，中共中央东北局召开的座谈会上，对此现象提出了批评，使运动深入了一步。各厂矿都组织职工进行了深入的学习，发动职工展开了挖潜力、推广先进工作方法及找窍门等运动。经过这些运动，一般厂矿的增产节约计划都超过了上级分配的任务。沈阳某工厂从上级接受的任务为三万吨，厂部讨论时认为可以完成三万五千吨，但经群众讨论后，主动提出要完成四万三千九百三十吨。东北被服局第八厂在经过挖掘潜在力运动后，超过了原来增产五百吨计划的三十四倍。
    各厂职工在制订计划之后，又纷纷结合爱国公约展开了劳动竞赛运动。仅沈阳一地，至九月十七日，参加竞赛的已有机械、轻工、化学、纺织、电工等行业的一百二十多个单位。不少厂矿又分别签订了集体合同、车间联系合同和小组公约，以保证增产节约计划的完成。造纸五厂工人焦庆祥，为了安好焙烧炉，七天七夜都没离开炉边。某矿山机械厂技术员李静昆，改造了铣刀，提高了工作效率二十四倍，推行这种先进操作法后，每台铣床产量在今年最后四个月中，即可给国家增产节约四百六十六吨粮食的财富。沈阳冶炼厂工人自订了集体合同后，即提出了约一千余件的合理化建议，八、九月份并连续创造了二十四次新纪录。该厂已提前三个月完成了全年增产计划，并决定在第四季度，再给国家增产节约三万二千多吨粮食的财富。（本报综合）
