　　Conscientiously Strengthen Preferential Treatment Work
　　(Report by Xie Juezai, Minister of the Interior of the Central People's Government, at the First County Governor Conference in North China on September 20, 1951)
　　(Approved by the 110th Political Affairs Council Meeting of the Central People's Government on November 9, 1951)

　　I. Preferential Treatment Work is a Long-Term Political Task

　　Since the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, the People's Army, together with the people of North China, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, established anti-Japanese democratic base areas and persisted in a long-term revolutionary war, thereby achieving the liberation of the entire North China region and supporting the victory of the national revolutionary war. During the long revolutionary war, a large number of outstanding sons and daughters of the people of North China joined the People's Liberation Army. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 1.6 million households of family members of revolutionary martyrs, family members of revolutionary soldiers, and family members of revolutionary workers (hereinafter referred to as families of martyrs, families of soldiers, and families of workers) and disabled revolutionary soldiers in the North China region, totaling more than 6.55 million people, accounting for about 9 percent of the total population of the region; of which 90 percent live in rural areas, owning about 10 percent or more of the land in the region, and about 5 percent of the land in the region needs to be cultivated on their behalf due to financial difficulties and lack of labor. Today, the Chinese People's Liberation Army is standing at the forefront of national defense; the Chinese People's Volunteers are engaged in the great and heroic battle of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, demonstrating the Chinese people's high degree of patriotism and internationalism. Without the heroic struggle of the People's Liberation Army, the victory of the Chinese revolution would have been impossible; even after the victory, without the continued heroic struggle of the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, it would be impossible to safeguard the security of the motherland and the people's peaceful and happy lives. As Chairman Mao pointed out: "Without a people's army, the people would have nothing." Therefore, in order to further consolidate the People's Liberation Army and the People's Volunteers, and strengthen national defense construction, governments at all levels must regard preferential treatment work as a major and long-term political task, put it on the regular agenda, educate the masses to love their own army, and conscientiously do a good job in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of martyrs, families of soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers. This is "a fundamental task" instructed by Chairman Mao to consolidate the people's army.

　　II. Main Experiences and Problems of Preferential Treatment Work

　　In the long revolutionary struggle, the preferential treatment work in the North China region, like other work, has good traditions and experiences. Although the number of families of martyrs and soldiers in the North China region is very large, and the lives of the masses were extremely difficult in the past and are still difficult today, due to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, the hard work of cadres at all levels and the active efforts of all the people, especially due to the inseparable flesh-and-blood relationship of "the army loves the people, and the people support the army" formed between the army and the people in the long revolutionary war, the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families has still achieved great success: it has educated the broad masses, recognized the importance of armed work, encouraged and increased the enthusiasm of the masses to join the army, thereby enabling the People's Army to be continuously strengthened and consolidated, and supported the long revolutionary war. It has cultivated the habit of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families among the masses and improved the political status of families of martyrs, families of soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers; it has settled and cared for families of martyrs, families of soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers from the aspects of organizing production, introducing work, and vocational skills; for families of martyrs, families of soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers who lack labor, the masses have been organized on a large scale to carry out cultivation on their behalf; in addition, with the active production and hard work of families of martyrs, families of soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers, their lives are mostly close to the living standards of the general masses, some have reached the living standards of the general masses, and some have even exceeded them.

　　The main experiences in achieving the above results are: leaders must attach importance to it, all departments of the government and people's organizations must cooperate closely, formulate plans, and conduct regular inspections. This is the key to doing a good job in preferential treatment work; it must be closely combined with other central tasks and patriotic education to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, mobilizing the power of all the people to form a regular and mass-based preferential treatment movement; mass education must be strengthened to inspire the enthusiasm of families of martyrs, families of soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers to participate in production and work; and various practical problems in the production and life of families of martyrs and soldiers must be firmly grasped, cultivation on their behalf must be done effectively in rural areas, and work of introducing jobs and organizing production must be done conscientiously in urban areas.

　　But upon strict inspection, there are still the following main problems in the preferential treatment work:

　　(1) Due to the peaceful environment after the victory of the revolutionary war, some leading organs and some cadres have developed paralyzing thoughts of neglecting politics and slackening their fighting spirit, and therefore do not pay enough attention to national defense construction and supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families.

　　(2) The leadership of preferential treatment work in some places is not the responsibility of the leaders to promote it in an all-round way, but simply pushed down or simply handed over to the civil affairs departments, and is not frequently supervised and inspected, resulting in "sometimes tight and sometimes loose" and "sometimes hot and sometimes cold" tendencies.

　　(3) Regarding the preferential treatment and priority rights that families of martyrs and soldiers should enjoy as stipulated in the preferential treatment regulations, since relevant departments such as banks, schools, health institutions, state-owned enterprises, and cooperatives have not formulated appropriate measures separately, most areas have not seriously implemented them to this day.

　　(4) Some places still have tendencies of "inverting families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers" and "relationships matter" and "giving preference to those nearby rather than those far away"; some places also have tendencies of giving equal preferential treatment regardless of the target.

　　Due to the existence of the above problems, the political status of families of martyrs, families of soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers in some areas has not been raised as it should be; and the difficulties in production and life of some families of martyrs and soldiers have not been properly resolved. This is an important problem in the current preferential treatment work, which must be carefully examined and effectively resolved.

　　III. Comprehensively Implement the Preferential Treatment Regulations and Do a Good Job in Preferential Treatment Work

　　Based on the above situation and experience, in order to further improve the preferential treatment work, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the preferential treatment regulations, implement the system, and do the following main tasks:

　　(1) Improve the social and political status of families of martyrs, families of soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers. Educate the people to love the people's army and respect families of martyrs, families of soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers, making it a social fashion and social morality. The methods are:

　　A. Absorb representatives of families of martyrs, families of soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers to participate in various political activities; they should also be given preferential treatment in various social activities.

　　B. In order to commend and commemorate heroes, a general survey should be conducted on the names of martyrs, and relics and anecdotes of martyrs should be collected, and biographies of martyrs should be compiled where possible. Currently, first, with the administrative village or district as the unit, existing public houses should be used to establish martyr memorial rooms to display the deeds of martyrs (the names of the masses killed by the enemy should also be registered and displayed), and memorial ceremonies such as regular tomb sweeping can be held to educate the masses to learn from their heroic revolutionary spirit.

　　C. Organs, schools, state-owned enterprises, and cooperatives should give care and preferential treatment to families of martyrs and families of soldiers. For example, public-funded students and scholarship quotas in schools should give priority to the children of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers; production loans issued by banks should first pay attention to supporting the production of families of martyrs and families of soldiers, etc.

　　D. Educate families of martyrs, families of soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers to cherish honor, carry forward revolutionary traditions, and strive for greater glory, and play an active leading role in various work and patriotic production increase movements; in particular, educate military families to encourage their children and husbands to work in the army with peace of mind and always be a glorious model revolutionary soldier.

　　(2) In rural areas, actively organize the production of families of martyrs, families of soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers, and help them establish their families. The methods are: A. Organize them to participate in labor mutual aid, and mobilize women among them to participate in production; B. Mobilize them to accumulate fertilizer, and mobilize the masses to help them conscientiously. This is an important way to increase the yield of their land and should be given attention; C. Organize sideline production, and give priority to them in terms of loaning grain, loans, and promoting the sale of local products; D. Mobilize the masses to help them solve difficulties such as water and firewood.

　　Organizing the masses to cultivate on behalf of families of martyrs and soldiers who lack labor is the most practical way to solve their production and life problems and must be done conscientiously. The masses should be educated to recognize that cultivation on their behalf is a glorious task. Martyrs and soldiers have made the greatest contribution to the people, and cultivating on behalf of their families is an obligation that the people should fulfill and should be carried out consciously. Advocate and reward model behaviors that are conscientious and responsible in doing a good job in cultivation on their behalf; correct the tendency of not paying attention to cultivation on their behalf, making the yield of land of families of martyrs and soldiers lower than the level of the general masses. Regarding who should enjoy cultivation on their behalf, and how much land should be cultivated on behalf of each household, the provisions of the preferential treatment regulations and the cultivation on their behalf measures of each province must be strictly implemented, using the methods of self-reporting and public discussion, mutual evaluation and comparison, and full democratic discussion, and approved by the village people's representative conference, and reported to the district people's government for review and approval. For those who should not enjoy cultivation on their behalf, such as salaried workers, cadres who do not separate from production, and families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers who have labor and can cultivate on their own, they should not be cultivated on their behalf, so that the masses can concentrate their efforts to solve the difficulties of families of martyrs and soldiers who are truly lacking or without labor. The method of cultivation on their behalf should be constantly studied and improved. Strictly cancel the practice of temporarily assigning errands and "randomly assigning troops," and universally promote the fixed cultivation on their behalf system. The advantages of the fixed cultivation on their behalf system: A. It can strengthen the sense of responsibility of the cultivators on their behalf; B. It ensures a certain guarantee for the yield of land of families of martyrs and soldiers; C. It is easy for cultivators on their behalf to allocate time to organize the use of labor and avoid wasting manpower and animal power and delaying the farming season. In some places, families of martyrs and soldiers and cultivators on their behalf have signed contracts, which is conducive to both parties' implementation and facilitates government inspection. This experience is worthy of attention and promotion. On the basis of fixed cultivation on their behalf, combined with the work-point system and the method of finding rice for work, the labor burden can be fairly balanced, and the enthusiasm of cultivators on their behalf and families of martyrs and soldiers for production can be encouraged. There are also methods such as contracting production and renting out for sharecropping, which can be adopted separately depending on local conditions.

　　The burden of cultivation on their behalf in old areas is relatively heavy, forming an imbalance in the burden of cultivation on their behalf between new and old areas. This is a practical problem that the masses demand to be solved and should be solved. In cases where it is indeed necessary, the coordination and adjustment or key adjustment can be appropriately carried out within the scope of the district or county to achieve general fairness and reasonableness in order to consolidate the masses' lasting enthusiasm for cultivation on their behalf. However, the implementation of this measure should pay attention to improving the enthusiasm of the masses for cultivation on their behalf, and grasp the accurate figures of the number of households enjoying cultivation on their behalf and the manpower and animal power that should be contributed for cultivation on their behalf in each village, so as to avoid expanding the scope of cultivation on their behalf or promoting the development of village-basedism. The main guarantee for doing a good job in cultivation on their behalf lies in carrying out sufficient political work and organizational work. In addition to regular political education, competitions and evaluations should be launched, models of cultivation on their behalf should be commended and rewarded, and a regular inspection system should be established.

　　(3) The method of solving the difficulties of families of martyrs, families of soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers in cities should be mainly based on introducing jobs and organizing production. The civil affairs departments should take the initiative to contact all parties. All organs and enterprises should adopt a welcoming attitude and should give them priority opportunities under the same conditions as the masses; and mobilize all walks of life to find ways to settle them. Organizing production should adopt a variety of methods according to the actual situation. When conditions permit, production cooperatives or small factories can be organized to engage in handicrafts or processing production, etc. The advantage is that the capital is small, the number of people employed is large, and the technical limitations are not large; there are still many difficulties in opening large factories at present, so it should not be advocated.

　　In addition, regardless of rural or urban areas, appropriate material subsidies should be given to families of martyrs and soldiers who are particularly difficult in life; but simple relief is not a way to solve the problem. Material subsidies should be combined with the organization of production and should be used in a focused manner to support them in establishing their families. According to the experience of various cities in North China, wherever the production is well organized, the need for material subsidies is greatly reduced.

　　IV. Strengthen Leadership and Conduct Strict Inspections

　　(1) Leaders of governments at all levels must attach importance to preferential treatment work. Government committees and administrative meetings should include it on the agenda, discuss it regularly, and submit it to the people's representative conference for discussion, formulate resolutions, mobilize the masses to conscientiously implement them, conduct regular inspections, summarize experiences, and report on time to form a system.

　　(2) The organizational form of the existing preferential treatment committees in counties, districts, and villages is good. In the future, the people's governments of counties, districts, and villages should assign special personnel to be responsible for it and absorb relevant departments and mass organizations to form preferential treatment committees to assist the government in promoting and inspecting preferential treatment work.

　　(3) Timely convene representative meetings of families of martyrs, families of soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers with the district or county as the unit, and absorb models of preferential treatment work to participate. Commend and reward families of martyrs and soldiers who are doing well in production, and strengthen the connection between the government and them; and methods such as holding symposiums, consolation visits, etc. can be adopted to improve their political status and political awareness.

　　(4) Lead the masses to earnestly include the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families in the patriotic pact and regularly check its implementation.

　　认真加强优抚工作
    （中央人民政府内务部部长谢觉哉一九五一年九月二十日在华北第一次县长会议上的报告）
    （一九五一年十一月九日中央人民政府政务院第一百一十次政务会议批准）
     一、优抚工作是一个长期的政治任务
    从抗日战争开始，人民军队就和华北的人民一起，在中国共产党领导下，创立抗日民主根据地，坚持长期的革命战争，从而取得了华北全区的解放，并支援全国革命战争取得了胜利。在长期的革命战争中，华北人民的优秀子弟大量地参加了人民解放军。根据不完全统计，华北区有革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命工作人员家属（以下简称烈属、军属、工属）和革命残废军人共一百六十余万户，六百五十五万余人，约占全区总人口数百分之九；其中百分之九十居住农村，所有土地约占全区土地百分之十以上，因生活困难、缺乏劳力而需要代耕的土地约占全区土地百分之五左右。今天，中国人民解放军正站在国防的最前线；中国人民志愿军正在从事伟大的抗美援朝的英勇战斗，他们表现了中国人民的高度的爱国主义和国际主义的精神。没有人民解放军的英勇奋斗，中国革命的胜利是不可能的；胜利了，没有人民解放军和中国人民志愿军继续英勇奋斗，要保卫祖国的安全和人民的安居乐业的生活，也是不可能的。正如毛主席所指示：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”因此，为了进一步巩固人民解放军和人民志愿军，加强国防建设，各级人民政府必须把优抚工作当作一项重大的长期的政治任务，列为经常的议事日程，教育群众热爱人民自己的军队，认真做好拥军和优待烈属、军属和革命残废军人的工作。这是毛主席指示的巩固人民军队的“一个根本工作”。
    二、优抚工作的主要经验和问题
    在长期的革命斗争中，华北地区的优抚工作如同其他工作一样，有着良好的传统与经验。华北地区的烈属、军属数量虽然很大，群众生活虽然在过去曾极为艰苦，今天也仍有困难，但是，由于中国共产党和人民政府的正确领导，各级干部的艰苦工作和全体人民的积极努力，特别由于军队与人民在长期革命战争中所形成的“军爱民、民拥军”的不可分离的血肉关系，仍然使拥军优属工作获得了很大的成绩：教育了广大群众，认识武装工作的重要性，鼓舞和增长了群众的参军热潮，从而使人民军队得到不断的壮大和巩固，支持了长期革命战争。在群众中培养了拥军优属的习惯，提高了烈属、军属和革命残废军人的政治地位；从组织生产、介绍工作和职业等方面，安置和照顾了烈属、军属和革命残废军人；对于缺乏劳动力的烈属、军属和革命残废军人，则大规模地组织群众进行了代耕工作；加以烈属、军属和革命残废军人的积极生产，努力劳动，他们的生活大部分接近于一般群众生活水平，部分达到了一般群众生活水平，个别还有超过的。
    获得以上成绩的主要经验是：必须领导重视，政府各部门与人民团体密切配合，订出计划，经常检查，这是做好优抚工作的关键；必须与其他中心任务和抗美援朝爱国教育密切结合，发动全体人民的力量，形成经常的、群众性的优抚运动；必须加强群众教育，启发烈属、军属和革命残废军人参加生产和工作的积极性；必须抓紧解决烈属、军属生产和生活中的各种实际问题，在农村切实做好代耕工作，在城市认真做好介绍职业和组织生产的工作。
    但严格检查起来，优抚工作中，仍然存在着以下一些主要问题：
    （一）由于革命战争胜利后的和平环境，在某些领导机关和部分干部中间，产生了忽视政治、斗志松懈的麻痹思想，因而对国防建设和拥军优属工作不够重视。
    （二）有些地方对优抚工作的领导，不是首长负责，全面推动，而是单纯向下推或单纯交给民政部门去办，又不经常地加以督促和检查，因而产生了“时紧时松”“忽冷忽热”等偏向。
    （三）对优抚条例中所规定的烈属、军属应享受的优待和优先权，由于各有关部门如银行、学校、卫生机关、公营企业、合作社等，尚未分别制定适当办法，大部地区至今还没有认真执行。
    （四）有些地方还存在着“烈、军、工属倒置”和“人在人情在”“优近不优远”的偏向；也有些地方不看对象，存在着平均优待的偏向。
    由于上述问题的存在，致有些地区烈属、军属和革命残废军人的政治地位还没有得到应有的提高；有些烈属、军属生产和生活上的困难还没有得到适当的解决。这是目前优抚工作中的重要问题，必须认真检查，切实解决。
    三、全面贯彻执行优抚条例，做好优抚工作
    根据以上情况和经验，进一步做好优抚工作，必须认真执行优抚条例，贯彻制度，做好下列主要工作：
    （一）提高烈属、军属和革命残废军人的社会政治地位。教育人民群众热爱人民军队和尊敬烈属、军属和革命残废军人，使之形成社会风尚和社会道德。其办法：
    甲、在各种政治活动中吸收烈属、军属和革命残废军人代表参加；在各种社会活动中也应优待他们。
    乙、为褒扬与纪念英烈，应普遍调查烈士姓名，搜集烈士遗事遗物，在可能条件下编写烈士传记。目前首先以行政村或区为单位，利用现有公共房舍，建立烈士纪念室，陈列烈士事迹（被敌杀害群众姓名，亦应登记陈列），并可定期举行扫墓等纪念仪式，以教育群众学习他们的英勇的革命精神。
    丙、机关、学校、公营企业、合作社应给烈属、军属以照顾和优待。如学校公费生和助学金名额，应尽先照顾革命烈士和革命军人的子女；银行发放的生产贷款应首先注意扶持烈属、军属的生产等。
    丁、教育烈属、军属和革命残废军人，珍贵荣誉，发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣，在各种工作和爱国增产运动中起积极带头作用；尤要教育军属鼓励其子弟和丈夫安心部队工作，永远做一个光荣的模范革命军人。
    （二）在农村，应积极组织烈属、军属和革命残废军人的生产，帮助他们建立家务。其办法：甲、组织他们参加劳动互助，发动他们中的妇女参加生产；乙、动员他们积肥，并发动群众认真帮助，这是增加他们土地产量的重要办法，应予以重视；丙、组织副业生产，在贷粮、贷款、推销土产等方面，尽先予以照顾；丁、发动群众帮助他们解决用水、打柴等项困难。
    组织群众为缺乏劳力的烈属、军属进行代耕，是解决他们生产、生活问题的最实际的办法，必须认真做好。应教育群众认识代耕是一种光荣的任务，烈士和军人为人民做了最大的贡献，为他们的家属代耕，是人民应尽的义务，应自觉地进行。提倡和奖励认真负责做好代耕的模范行为；纠正不重视代耕工作，使烈属、军属土地的产量低于一般群众水平的偏向。对于谁应该享受代耕，以及每户代耕土地多少，必须严格执行优抚条例和各省代耕办法的规定，采用自报公议、相互评比、充分进行民主讨论的办法，经村人民代表会议审查通过，报区人民政府审查批准。对于不应享受代耕的人，如薪金制工作人员，不脱离生产的干部，有劳力可以自耕的烈属、军属、工属等，应一律不予代耕，这样使群众可以集中全力解决真正缺乏或没有劳力的烈属、军属的困难。代耕方式应经常研究改进。严格取消临时派差“乱点兵”的作法，普遍推行固定代耕制度。固定代耕制度的优点：甲、可以加强代耕人的责任心；乙、使烈属、军属土地的产量获得一定的保障；丙、代耕人易于调配时间组织劳力的使用，不致浪费人力、畜力，耽误耕作季节。有些地方烈属、军属与代耕人订立合同，既利于双方实行，又便于政府检查，这种经验值得重视与推广。在固定代耕的基础上，结合着工票制度、齐工找米办法，既使劳力负担得到相当平衡，又可以鼓励代耕人和烈属、军属生产的积极性。还有包产和出租分收等办法，都可视当地情况，分别加以采用。
    老区代耕负担较重，形成新区老区之间代耕负担的不平衡状态。这是群众要求解决也是应该解决的一个实际问题。在确实需要的情况下，目前可在区或县的范围内，适当地统筹调剂或重点调剂，做到大体上公平合理，以巩固群众持久的代耕情绪。但此项办法的推行，应注意提高群众代耕的积极性，掌握各村享受代耕户代耕亩数和应出代耕工的人力、畜力的确实数字，以免扩大代耕面或助长村本位主义的发展。做好代耕工作的主要保证，在于进行充分的政治工作和组织工作。除了经常进行政治教育外，应该发动竞赛和评比，表扬和奖励代耕模范，并建立经常的检查制度。
    （三）城市解决烈属、军属和革命残废军人困难的办法，应以介绍职业和组织生产为主。民政部门应主动与各方面联系。各机关与企业部门应采取欢迎态度，在与群众同等条件下，应使他们获得优先机会；并发动各行各业大家想办法安置。组织生产应根据实际情况采用多种多样的办法。条件允许时可组织生产合作社或小型工厂，从事手工业或加工生产等，其好处是资金小，用人多，技术限制不大；开办大型工厂目前尚有许多困难，故不应提倡。
    此外，不论乡村和城市，对生活特别困难的烈属、军属应进行适当的实物补助；但单纯救济不是解决问题的办法。实物补助应结合组织生产进行，并应重点使用，以扶植其建立家务。华北各城市的经验，凡生产组织得好的地方，实物补助的需要就大大减少了。
        四、加强领导、严格检查
    （一）各级政府领导者必须重视优抚工作，政府委员会和行政会议要列为议事日程，定期讨论，并提请人民代表会议加以讨论，制成决议，发动群众认真贯彻，经常检查，总结经验，按期报告，形成制度。
    （二）目前县、区、村已有的优抚委员会的组织形式是好的，今后县、区、村人民政府应责成专人负责，并吸收有关部门和群众团体组成优抚委员会，协助政府推动检查优抚工作。
    （三）以区或县为单位适时地召集烈属、军属和革命残废军人代表会，吸收优抚工作模范参加，对生产好的烈属、军属加以表扬与奖励，密切政府与他们的联系；并可采用开座谈会、慰劳访问等办法，以提高他们的政治地位和政治觉悟。
    （四）领导群众将拥军优属工作切实订入爱国公约，并经常检查其执行情形。
