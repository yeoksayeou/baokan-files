    To Mr. Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, and to the distinguished members of the Second Session of the Council:

    The Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is pleased to learn that your meeting is being held today in Vienna, and extends heartfelt congratulations and sincere respect.

    World peace is currently facing a serious threat. The United States government and the governments of its vassal states are now making every effort to expand armaments, expand the network of military bases, and prepare for a new world war. Under this policy, the United States government continues to occupy our country's Taiwan in the East, persists in its war of aggression against Korea, and adopts shameful tactics of obstruction and blackmail in the Korean armistice negotiations. The United States government signed the illegal separate "peace treaty" with Japan in order to facilitate their indefinite occupation of Japan, revive Japanese militarism, and use Japanese bases, materials, and manpower to carry out wars of aggression, and is using so-called bilateral and multilateral security treaties to organize an aggressive bloc in the Far East. The massacres and suppression of the people of colonial and dependent countries, fully supported by the United States government, are unfolding in Vietnam, Malaya, the Philippines, and Morocco in North Africa. In the Middle East, the ruling groups of the United States, Britain, and France are infringing upon the sovereignty of Iran, Egypt, and Iraq, attempting to force the entire Middle East into the net of their war plans. These facts show that the warmongers who are enemies of world peace are attempting to push Asia and North Africa into the abyss of war, just like Europe and the Americas.

    However, while this war crisis exists seriously, the forces defending world peace have also been strengthened unprecedentedly on the side of the world's people. The great Soviet Union is growing stronger day by day, the People's Republic of China is becoming more consolidated and stronger, the people's democratic countries are developing vigorously, a new high tide of anti-aggression is rising in Asia and North Africa, and the world people's peace movement has made war makers encounter resolute resistance everywhere. Under these circumstances, as long as the peace-loving people of the world can unite all possible forces and take on the cause of maintaining peace, they will surely be able to shatter the conspiracies of the warmongers and prevent the outbreak of a new world war!

    The Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference fully supports the important propositions adopted by the First Session of the World Peace Council in February this year, aimed at the peaceful settlement of international disputes, and today passed a resolution expressing its full support for the movement to conclude a Five-Power Peace Pact. For the sake of world peace, the Chinese people will resolutely fight for a fair and reasonable Korean armistice agreement, and will resolutely oppose the "peace treaty" with Japan signed in San Francisco, oppose the revival of Japanese militarism and German fascism by the United States, and oppose the aggressive actions of the American and British aggressors in Asia and North Africa. The Chinese people firmly guarantee to always stand with the peace-loving people of the world and fight to the end to defend world peace and win the victory of the peace pact movement!

    Wishing your meeting success!

    The Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference

    致世界和平理事会电世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里先生并转理事会第二次会议诸位先生：
    中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议欣悉你们的会议今天在维也纳举行，谨致衷心的祝贺和诚挚的敬意。
    世界的和平现正面临着严重的威胁。美国政府及其仆从国家的政府现正竭力扩大军备，扩张军事基地网，准备新的世界战争。在这个政策之下，美国政府在东方继续侵占我国的台湾，坚持对朝鲜的侵略战争，并对朝鲜停战谈判采取可耻的阻挠和讹诈的战术。美国政府签订非法的单独对日“和约”，以便于他们无限期地占领日本，复活日本军国主义，利用日本基地、物资和人力来进行侵略战争，并正在利用所谓双边的和多边的安全条约进行组织远东的侵略集团。美国政府所全力支持的对殖民地附属国人民的屠杀和镇压正在越南、马来亚、菲律宾和北非的摩洛哥等地展开。在中东地区美英法的统治集团侵犯伊朗、埃及和伊拉克的主权，企图迫使整个中东陷入他们的战争计划的罗网里面。这些事实表明与世界和平为敌的战争贩子们正在企图把亚洲和北非与欧洲美洲一样地推向战争的深渊。
    但是，在这战争危机严重地存在着的同时，在世界人民方面，保卫世界和平的力量也已空前地壮大起来了。伟大的苏联日益增强，中华人民共和国日益巩固和壮大，各人民民主国家正在蓬勃发展，亚洲和北非正掀起反侵略的新高潮，世界人民的和平运动已使战争制造者到处碰到坚决的反抗。在这种情形之下，只要世界上爱好和平的人民能够团结一切可能团结的力量，把维护和平的事业担当起来，那就一定能粉碎战争贩子的阴谋，制止新的世界大战的发生。
    中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议完全拥护今年二月间世界和平理事会第一次会议所通过的旨在和平解决国际纠纷的各项重要主张，并且在今天通过了一项决议，表示对于缔结五大国和平公约运动的完全支持。为了世界和平的利益，中国人民将为公平合理的朝鲜停战协议而坚决斗争，并将坚决反对在旧金山签订的对日“和约”，反对美国复活日本的军国主义和德国的法西斯主义，反对美英侵略者在亚洲及北非各地肆行侵略的行动。中国人民坚决保证永远与世界爱好和平的人民在一起，为保卫世界和平及争取和平公约运动的胜利而奋斗到底！
    祝你们的会议成功！
    中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议
    一九五一年十一月一日
