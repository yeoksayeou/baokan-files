    US Memorandum to Our Side
    Admits US Aircraft Intruded into Vietnam Conference Area
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th] Our correspondent reports: Our Chief Liaison Officer, Colonel Zhang, received a memorandum from the US Chief Liaison Officer, Kenney, at 10:55 AM on the 16th. The memorandum was the US response to the investigation into the intrusion of a US fighter plane into the Panmunjom conference area in Vietnam on the 10th of this month. The investigation proved that at approximately 8:05 AM on November 10th, three US aircraft flew over the conference area after conducting a strafing mission approximately five miles northwest of the area. Kenney admitted that one of the aircraft "entered the airspace above the conference site and immediately departed." Despite the clear weather at the time and the presence of marker balloons above the conference area, Kenney explained that the aircraft's intrusion was "due to a navigational error." Kenney concluded the memorandum by saying, "We regret this infringement due to technical error and are taking every possible step to prevent its recurrence."

    美方致我方备忘录一件
    承认美机侵越会场区
    【新华社开城十九日电】本社记者报道：我方首席联络官张上校在十六日上午十时五十五分收到美方首席联络官肯尼的备忘录一件。备忘录是美方对本月十日美方战斗机一架侵越板门店会场区上空一事调查结果的答复。调查结果证明，十一月十日上午八时零五分左右，美机三架在会场区西北约五哩处执行扫射任务后飞过会场区。肯尼承认其中一架“进入会址区上空后立即飞离”。尽管当时天气晴朗，会场区上空有标志气球，但肯尼仍解释该机侵越会场区上空是“由于航行上的错误”。肯尼在备忘录最后称：“我们对这一由于技术错误的侵犯表示遗憾，正采取每一可能的步骤以防止其再度发生。”
