Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 5th, via TASS: President Pieck of the German Democratic Republic wrote a letter on November 2nd to President Heuss of the West German Federal Republic, suggesting that they hold a joint meeting to discuss the convening of an all-German conference to discuss the peaceful reunification of Germany and the acceleration of the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.

President Pieck pointed out in his letter that the decisions made by the Adenauer government in recent days and weeks will have disastrous effects on the German nation, and these decisions will further divide Germany. Washington's decision to involve West Germany in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and re-militarize it will turn Germany into a bridgehead for a war of unprecedented devastation. In this war, all the German people will become victims. He pointed out that it is based on this consideration that the government of the German Democratic Republic and the People's Chamber have proposed to the West German Federal Parliament the convening of an all-German conference to discuss the holding of free all-German elections and the acceleration of the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. The rejection of these proposals by the Adenauer government and the majority of members of the Federal Parliament demonstrates their determination to obstruct any understanding between eastern and western Germany.

President Pieck pointed out that the presidents of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic, in accordance with the high responsibility they bear to the people, should be able to ensure that foreigners do not solve Germany's fate, but first reach an agreement among the Germans themselves.

Regarding the issue raised by the Adenauer government concerning the preconditions for investigating the holding of free elections, President Pieck stated that the government of the German Democratic Republic agrees to conduct investigations throughout Germany. However, such investigations are best conducted by the Germans themselves through a committee composed of representatives from eastern and western Germany under the control of the representatives of the four major powers, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France.

President Pieck suggested that the joint presidential meeting be held in the capital of Germany - Berlin, and requested that President Heuss notify him of the meeting date as soon as possible.

    皮克总统致函西德总统休斯
    建议举行联席会议讨论召开全德会议问题
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社柏林五日讯：德意志民主共和国总统皮克在十一月二日写信给西德联邦共和国总统休斯，建议和他举行一次联席会议，商量关于召开全德会议，以便讨论和平统一德国及加速缔结对德和约的问题。
    皮克总统在信中首先指出：阿登纳政府在最近几天和几星期中所作出的各项决定，对于德意志民族将有招致灾难的影响，这些决定会进一步分化德国。华盛顿关于使西德参加北大西洋侵略公约和重新军国主义化的决定，将使德国变为一场空前浩劫的战争的桥头堡。在这个战争中，德国全体人民都将成为受害者。他指出：正是基于这种考虑，德意志民主共和国政府和人民议会向西德联邦议会建议召开全德会议，以讨论举行全德自由选举和加速缔结对德和约的问题。阿登纳政府和联邦议会大多数议员对于这些建议的拒绝，说明了他们决心阻挠德国东部和西部之间取得任何谅解。
    皮克总统指出：德意志民主共和国和联邦共和国的总统，按照他们对人民所负有的高度责任，应该能做到不让外国人来解决德国的命运，而首先在德国人自己之间取得协议。
    关于阿登纳政府所提出的应调查举行自由选举的先决条件的问题，皮克总统表示：德意志民主共和国政府同意在德国各地举行调查，但是，这种调查最好通过在苏、美、英、法四大国代表管制下的德国东部和西部代表组成的委员会，由德国人自己来进行。
    皮克总统建议总统联席会议在德国的首都——柏林举行，并请休斯总统尽速把会议日期通知他。
