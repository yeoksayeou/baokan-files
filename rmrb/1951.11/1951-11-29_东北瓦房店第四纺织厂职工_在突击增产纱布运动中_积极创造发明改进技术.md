    Workers of the No. 4 Textile Factory in Wafangdian, Northeast China,
    Actively Create Inventions and Improve Technology in the Spurt to Increase Production of Gauze

    Editor: After seeing the instructions issued by the Ministry of Textile Industry and the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China on the spurt to increase the production of gauze, the workers of the No. 4 Textile Factory in Wafangdian, Northeast China, immediately took action, using their brains to find shortcuts and tap potential. From November 1st to November 15th, many inventions, creations, and technological improvements emerged within fifteen days. The finishing workshop in the weaving mill improved the packaging method, which can save the country about one ton of grain wealth every day. The packaged cloth bales are very neat, and each train car can hold 5,200 bales (the Northeast Textile Administration Bureau standard is 4,500 bales), setting a national packaging record. With the active efforts of engineers and technicians, the operation method of the first roving frame in the roving workshop has been improved, doubling the output and greatly improving the quality. Thanks to the efforts of all the workers in the factory, as of November 20th, the output of yarn (converted to 20 counts) has completed 84.83% of the monthly target; the output of cloth (converted to People's Municipal Cloth) has completed 80.3% of the monthly target. I believe that in the movement to increase production and practice economy, the creativity of workers must be brought into play in order to achieve good results. The examples cited here are proof of this.　Lü Xiwen

    东北瓦房店第四纺织厂职工
    在突击增产纱布运动中
    积极创造发明改进技术
    编辑同志：东北瓦房店第四纺织厂职工，在报纸上看到中央纺织工业部和中国纺织工会全国委员会发出突击增产纱布的指示以后，立即行动起来，开动脑筋，找窍门，挖潜力。从十一月一日到十五日十五天中，即出现了许多发明创造和改进技术的办法。织布场整理车间改进了打包方法，每天可给国家节省约一吨粮食的财富。打出的布包非常整齐，每一火车皮可装五千二百包（东北纺织管理局标定四千五百包），创造全国包装最高纪录。在工程师与技术人员的积极努力下，改进了粗纱车间头道机的操作方法，提高产量一倍，质量也大大提高。由于全厂职工的努力，截至十一月二十日，纱（折合二十支）的产量已完成全月百分之八十四点八三；布（折合人民市布）的产量已完成全月百分之八十点三。我觉得在增产节约运动中，必须发挥工人的创造性，才能做出好的成绩，这里所举的例子就是一个明证。　吕希文
