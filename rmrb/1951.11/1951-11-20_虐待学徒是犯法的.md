Brief Commentary on Economic Life

　　Abusing Apprentices is Illegal
    The incidents of unscrupulous capitalists abusing apprentices in various regions should arouse serious attention from Party organizations at all levels, government organs, the broad masses of workers, and capitalists.
    The news published in today's newspaper points out that some unscrupulous capitalists in various regions, who do not understand righteousness, are still implementing feudal rule over apprentices. They infringe upon apprentices' rights to participate in political activities; indefinitely extend apprentices' working hours; arbitrarily beat and abuse apprentices, even to the point of driving them to their deaths. This is criminal behavior and is not permitted by national laws. In addition to continuing persuasive education for these unscrupulous capitalists, it is more important to give them the legal punishment they deserve, according to the severity of their crimes, as a warning to those who openly infringe upon the people's rights.
    It is worth noting that some trade union cadres, government workers, and even some Communist Party members, turn a blind eye to the incidents of unscrupulous capitalists abusing apprentices. They either ignore these shocking events or offer unprincipled "lenient treatment." This has fueled the arrogance of some unscrupulous capitalists. Some unscrupulous capitalists in Beijing even said, "It doesn't matter if we go to court." These comrades must be reminded: you shout "Serve the people" all day long, but why don't you serve these oppressed and humiliated apprentices? What thinking makes you watch unscrupulous capitalists run rampant without taking any action? We believe that the relevant authorities should seriously handle these incidents of abusing apprentices and not allow any illegal capitalists to continue to do evil.

### 虐待学徒是犯法的

　　虐待学徒是犯法的
    各地不法资方虐待学徒的事件，应该引起各级党的组织、政府机关、广大工人和资方的严重注意。
    今日本报登载的消息指出：各地若干不明大义的不法资方，对于学徒仍然实行着封建的统治。他们侵害学徒参加政治活动的权利；无限制地延长学徒的工作时间；随意殴打、虐待学徒，甚至逼死人命。这是一种犯罪的行为，是国家法令所不允许的。对于这些不法资方，除了应该向他们继续进行说服教育以外，更重要的，是按其犯罪情节的轻重，给予应得的法律处分，以为公开侵犯人民权利者戒。
    值得注意的是，有若干工会干部、政府工作人员，甚至某些共产党员，对于不法资方虐待学徒的事件，竟然熟视无睹。他们对于这些使人触目惊心的事件，或者是不闻不问，或者是无原则的“从宽处理”。这就助长了某些不法资方的气焰。北京有些不法资方就说：“到法院看看也没有关系”。必须提醒这些同志：你们成天喊着“为人民服务”，但为什么不为这些被压迫、被侮辱的学徒服务呢？是什么思想使你们眼看着不法资方随意横行，而竟无动于中呢？我们认为：有关机关应该严重处理这些虐待学徒的事件，不许任何非法资方继续为非作恶。
