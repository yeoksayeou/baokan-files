    Anhui North Liu'an Prefecture Staff Member Xia Yu
    Illegally Procured Timber; Should Be Dealt With

    Editor: Xia Yu, an accountant in the general affairs section of the Anhui North Liu'an Prefecture General Affairs Office, went to Huoshan County to cut fir trees from August 25th to September 12th this year without requesting approval from the Anhui North Administrative Office as required. After the Huoshan County People's Government discovered this, it immediately notified Xia Yu on September 12th to stop the procurement and reported it to the Liu'an Prefecture for handling. However, after Xia Yu returned to Liu'an, he obtained a letter of introduction from the Prefecture Office and a purchase permit issued by the Prefecture Office's Industry and Commerce Section, and still came to Huoshan to cut a large amount of timber. On October 3rd, in accordance with the instructions of the Liu'an Prefecture, the Huoshan County People's Government impounded all the timber waiting to be transported in Huoshan from all sectors, handing it over to the Coal Construction Company for requisition and reception for unified distribution, and informed Xia Yu of this situation, asking him to stop the procurement. However, Xia Yu ignored this, not only continuing to cut a large amount of timber, but also entrusting merchants to purchase it along the way.

    I believe that Comrade Xia Yu's act of cutting a large amount of timber without legal procedures violates the "Instructions on Saving Timber" promulgated by the Central People's Government Government Administration Council on August 13th. The instructions stipulate that "No state-owned enterprise, organization, military unit, group, or school shall cut timber or engage in buying and selling timber business for any reason or in any name." There is also a point of doubt worth raising: Xia Yu's September 17th letter of introduction from the Prefecture Office stated: "Purchasing 5,000 telephone poles and 300 square planks on behalf of the Shandong Jiaozhou Prefecture Office, please assist Huoshan County in the purchase." The purchase permit issued by the Prefecture Office's Industry and Commerce Section on September 16th stated: "Jiaozhou Native Produce and General Merchandise Company is carrying cash to Huoshan to purchase 5,000 fir trees and 300 square planks in August for the construction of houses; this is a supplementary certificate. Right to be held by Jiaozhou Native Produce and General Merchandise Company." Obviously, the two descriptions differ not only in the date of purchase, but also in the purpose and the organization of purchase. I hope the Liu'an Prefecture will handle this matter quickly.
    Staff Member of the Anhui North Administrative Office Agricultural and Forestry Department, You Dezhong

### 皖北六安专署工作人员夏煜  违法采购木材应予处理

    皖北六安专署工作人员夏煜
    违法采购木材应予处理
    编辑同志：皖北六安专署总务科机关生产部会计夏煜，今年八月二十五日到九月十二日，未按规定请求皖北行署批准，即在霍山县采伐杉木。霍山县人民政府发觉后，即于九月十二日通知夏煜停止采购，并报请六安专署处理。但夏煜返回六安，取得专署介绍信及专署工商科签发的准购证后，仍来霍山大量采伐。十月三日，霍山县人民政府遵照六安专署指示，将各界在霍山待运的木材一律扣留，移交煤建公司征购接收，以便统筹分配，并将此情形面告夏煜，请他停止采购。但夏煜置之不理，不仅继续大量采伐，还委托商人沿途收购。
    我认为夏煜同志这种未经合法手续大量采伐木材的行为，是违反了中央人民政府政务院八月十三日公布的“关于节约木材的指示”。该指示规定：“任何公营企业、机关、部队、团体和学校，不得以任何理由用任何名义采伐木材和经营买卖木材生意”。还有一点疑问值得提出：夏煜所拿的专署九月十七日的介绍信中略称：“代山东胶州专署购买电线杆五千根，方板三百根，请霍山县予以协助进行购买。”专署工商科九月十六日的准购证上则称：“兹有胶州土产百货公司为建筑房屋，携带现金赴霍山，已于八月份购买杉木五千根、方板三百根，特此补发证明。右给胶州土产百货公司收执。”很明显，两者所述不仅收购日期不同，而且收购用途和收购机关也不同。我希望六安专署迅速处理此事。皖北行署农林处工作人员　游德中
