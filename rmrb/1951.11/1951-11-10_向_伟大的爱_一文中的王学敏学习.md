    Learning from Wang Xuemin in the Article "Great Love"
    Editor: After reading the article "Great Love" published in the People's Daily on October 21st, I was deeply moved. I understand more clearly how the broad masses of people are loving their motherland with concrete actions. Like the automobile driver's assistant, Comrade Wang Xuemin, in order to save money to donate airplanes and cannons and eliminate more American devils, he is not afraid of the hot sun and does not rest during his breaks, but goes to wipe the car to extend its life. This concrete manifestation of loving the motherland made me think of myself. I am a typist, and I am really ashamed compared to Comrade Wang Xuemin. I have not cherished my typewriter like he cherished his car. I rarely carefully wipe it and treat it as my beloved thing. After reading this article, I am determined to learn from Comrade Wang Xuemin, to wipe, wash, and oil the machine more frequently, so that it will have fewer problems and last for more years, and I will donate the saved repair costs to airplanes and cannons.

    向“伟大的爱”一文中的王学敏学习
    编辑同志：当我读了人民日报十月二十一日所载“伟大的爱”一文后，我深深地被感动了。我更加清楚知道了广大人民是怎样用具体行动热爱着自己的祖国。像汽车司机助手王学敏同志，他为了节约捐献飞机大炮，多消灭美国鬼子，不怕火热的太阳晒，休息时不休息，去擦汽车，以延长汽车的寿命。这种热爱祖国的具体表现，使我联想到我自己。我是一个打字员，我比起王学敏同志来实在惭愧。我没有像他那样去爱护自己的打字机，我很少小心翼翼地去擦它，把它当成我心爱的东西去爱它。我读了这篇文章后，下定决心要向王学敏同志学习，对机器多擦、多洗、勤上油，这样可以少出毛病，多用几年，将节省的修理费捐献飞机大炮。
