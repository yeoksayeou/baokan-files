　　Tangshan Power Plant
    Sets New National Record for Reducing Coal Consumption
    The Tangshan Power Plant is the unit with the lowest coal consumption among power plants in the country using chain grate furnaces. According to the calculation method of the General Administration of Power Industry, the plant's coal consumption in the first half of this year has been reduced to a standard of 0.592 kilograms per kilowatt-hour. At the special coal-saving production conference held by the National Committee of the China Electrical Workers' Union, the plant's employee representatives stated that they have full confidence in reducing coal consumption to 0.585 kilograms per kilowatt-hour by the end of this year.
    Reducing coal consumption depends on the efforts of all employees of the power plant and cannot be achieved solely by a few engineering and technical personnel or a small number of skilled veteran workers. Under the education of the Party, the technical personnel of the Tangshan Power Plant gradually understood how to cooperate with workers and give play to the great strength of the workers. Due to the improvement of their political status, the workers established a sense of responsibility as masters and eagerly demanded to learn theoretical knowledge in order to improve production. Technical personnel and workers jointly found a path that closely combines theory with practice. For example, the boiler workers of the plant initially did not believe that the amount of carbon dioxide content was related to reducing coal consumption. Therefore, when technical personnel were present, they would reduce the wind and lengthen the fire bed, but after the technical personnel left, they would still operate as before. Later, after the workers understood the importance of carbon dioxide content, they improved the old operating methods, learned to analyze carbon dioxide content themselves, and used carbon dioxide content to calculate heat loss.
    In the early stage of the coal-saving campaign in the plant, the three shift teams in the boiler workshop had a tendency toward departmentalism, vying for credit and taking shortcuts. For example, steam must be used for soot blowing, and hot water must be discharged during water drainage. These would affect coal consumption performance. Therefore, some people did not blow soot or drain water according to the prescribed time. Even when handing over shifts, they would leave smoke and a thin coal layer for the next shift. Shortly after taking over, the next shift had to add a coal layer, add coal, and run at high speed to supplement power because the steam pressure dropped. As a result, the coal consumption of the three shifts was particularly high for about an hour after taking over, which greatly affected the unity between the three shifts and the continued reduction of coal consumption performance of the entire plant. Later, after the continuous education of the Party, the Party members took the lead in making guarantees, and the trade union suggested that the administration formulate coal layer standards for shift handover, which overcame this tendency. At present, the plant is compiling economic coal combustion and economic dispatch regulations, and plans to add high-pressure heaters and desuperheaters to consolidate and develop existing achievements and accumulate more funds for the country.

### 唐山发电厂创全国降低煤耗新纪录

　　唐山发电厂
    创全国降低煤耗新纪录
    唐山发电厂是全国使用炼条炉的发电厂中煤耗最低的单位。该厂今年上半年的煤耗，按照电业管理总局的计算办法，已降低到每度电○·五九二公斤的标准。在中国电业工会全国委员会召开省煤专题生产会议时，该厂职工代表表示有充分信心，在今年年底使煤耗降低到每度电○·五八五公斤。
    降低煤耗，是依靠发电厂全体职工的努力，不是单凭几个工程技术人员或是少数技术熟练的老工人就能搞好的。唐山发电厂的技术人员，在党的教育下，逐渐懂得了怎样和工人合作，发挥工人的伟大力量；工人由于政治地位的提高，树立了主人翁的责任感，迫切地要求学习理论知识，以便把生产搞得更好些。技术人员和工人，共同找到了理论与实际密切结合的道路。如该厂锅炉工人，起初不相信二氧化炭含量多少，对降低煤耗有关系；因此，当着技术人员在场时，便把风使小，把火铺长；而在技术人员走了以后，仍是照旧操作。后来，工人懂得了二氧化炭含量的重要性以后，就改善了旧操作法，自己也学习化验二氧化炭含量，并利用二氧化炭含量，计算热的损失。
    该厂开展省煤运动初期，锅炉车间的三个运转班曾发生过争功取巧的本位主义偏向。例如，吹灰时必须用汽，放水时要把热水放走。这都会影响煤耗成绩，因此，便有人不按照规定时间吹灰、放水。甚至在临交班时，给下一班留下烟火和薄煤层。下一班接班后不久，因为汽压下降，必须加煤层、加煤、开快车，补充电力。结果，三班在接班后一小时左右，煤耗都特别高，大大地影响了三班间的团结和全厂的煤耗成绩继续降低。后来经过党的不断教育，党员带头提出保证，工会建议行政制定了交接班时煤层标准，才克服了这一偏向。目前该厂正进行编制经济燃煤与经济调度规程，并计划增加高压加热器及减温器等设备，以便巩固和发展现有的成绩，给国家积累更多的资金。（陈今桂、石锐）
