　　Most Cooperatives in Shijiazhuang Prefecture
    are Slow to Recover Prepaid Cotton

    The work of recovering prepaid cotton by most cooperatives in Shijiazhuang Prefecture, Hebei Province, is very slow. The planned recovery of prepaid seed cotton in the counties of the prefecture for September was over 9,520,000 catties, but only 7,560,000 catties were actually recovered, accounting for less than 80% of the recovery task for that month. Among them, only Gaoyi County exceeded its target, while all other counties failed to meet their targets. Zanhuang County was originally assigned to recover 10,000 catties of ginned cotton, but not a single catty was recovered. Lingshou County was assigned 100,000 catties of ginned cotton, but only 6,000 catties of seed cotton were recovered. The main reasons for this situation are: (1) Leading cadres in the counties did not pay enough attention to this important political task, and preparations were insufficient beforehand; some counties made arrangements very late. (2) Many grassroots cooperative cadres do not understand that the country urgently needs cotton, and are blindly optimistic, thinking that there is no need to worry about recovering this small amount of cotton. (3) Some counties have relaxed market management and have not supplied enough ripe cotton in a timely manner, resulting in market prices being higher than listed prices, which has affected the work of recovering prepaid cotton.

　　Severe Waste of Manpower and Resources in Cotton Purchasing Work in Shijiazhuang and Other Prefectures

    Due to the lack of organization and leadership, cooperatives in Shijiazhuang and other prefectures of Hebei Province have experienced waste of manpower and resources in the purchase of new cotton. With the development of cotton purchasing operations, the manpower and resources invested in this work by cooperatives in various cotton-producing areas are very large. Taking Shijiazhuang, Handan, Xingtai, and Hengshui prefectures in Hebei Province as an example, there are a total of 885 cotton purchasing units (grassroots cooperatives), 9,587 cotton purchasing cadres, and 21,097 organized manual cotton gins (approximately 50% of all cotton gins, and the organization is continuing), and 1,093 powered cotton gins. In addition, the total number of people required for picking, sifting, baling, and transporting cotton is over 40,000. However, due to the unreasonable use of manpower, the due role has not been brought into play.

    Grassroots cooperatives do not have work quotas and lack comprehensive plans, so they cannot reasonably use cotton purchasing staff, resulting in waste of manpower. Some grassroots cooperatives have too many staff and not enough cotton to purchase, and some staff work half a day and rest half a day, or are busy on market days and idle on weekdays. Under normal circumstances, each cotton purchasing cadre at the grassroots level can collect an average of 1,700 to 2,000 catties of seed cotton per day, but currently, some grassroots staff only collect 200 catties per person per day.

    Some cotton purchasing units have not rationally used cotton ginning equipment and brought into play the enthusiasm of cotton ginning workers. The cooperatives have not signed contracts with the cotton ginning teams to determine the quantity and time of ginning. Some cotton is loaded onto trucks but cannot be ginning starts, and some cotton gins gin for half a day and then rest for half a day. Baling rooms sometimes accumulate ginned cotton that cannot be baled in time, and sometimes they are idle because ginned cotton has not been transported. There are also phenomena in the processing plants such as picking without sifting, and sifting without ginning. This fully exposes the shortcomings of each work department acting independently and not being connected to each other. (Wang Yueyi)

### 石家庄专区多数合作社  收回预购棉工作进展缓慢

　　石家庄专区多数合作社
    收回预购棉工作进展缓慢
    河北省石家庄专区多数合作社，收回预购棉的工作十分迟缓。该专区各县九月份计划收回预购籽棉九百五十二万余斤，结果仅收回籽棉七百五十六万余斤，占该月份收回任务的百分之八十弱。其中除高邑超额完成任务外，其他各县均未完成。赞皇县原分配收回一万斤皮棉，但是一斤都未收回。灵寿县分配十万斤皮棉，只收回籽棉六千斤。造成这种情况的主要原因是：（一）各县领导干部不重视这
    一重大的政治任务，事先准备不足，有的县布置得很迟。（二）许多基层合作社干部，不了解当前国家急需棉花，盲目乐观，认为这点棉花不愁收回。
    （三）有些县放松市场管理工作，又没有及时供应熟花，因而发生市价高于牌价的现象，影响了收回预购棉花工作。

    浪费人力物力现象很严重
    河北省石家庄等专区合作社在收购新棉工作中，由于缺乏组织领导，发生浪费人力、物力现象。随着购棉业务的开展，各棉区合作社投入这一工作中的人力、物力是很庞大的。以河北省石家庄、邯郸、邢台、衡水四个专区来说，共有收棉单位（基层社）八百八十五处，收棉干部九千五百八十七人，组织人力轧花车二万一千零九十七部（约占全部轧花车的百分之五十，正在继续组织），动力轧花车一千零九十三部；加上拣花、筛花、扎包、运送等工作所需人员，总数在四万以上。但是由于人力使用不合理，所以未能发挥应有的作用。
    基层社没有工作定额，缺少全面计划，因而不能合理使用收棉工作人员，形成人力浪费。有的基层社人员配备过多，而收棉不多，有些工作人员工作半天休息半天，或集日忙平日闲。基层社每个收花干部，按正常情况计算，每天平均可收一千七百斤至二千斤籽棉，但目前有部分基层社的工作人员，每日每人只收二百斤。
    有些收棉单位没有合理地使用轧花设备，和发挥轧花工人的积极性。合作社没有和轧花小组订立确定轧花的数量和时间的合同，有些棉花装上车不能开工，有些轧花车轧半天歇半天。扎包房有时积存皮棉不能及时扎包，有时因为没有运到皮棉而闲下来。各加工厂中还有拣出筛不出，筛出轧不完等现象。充分暴露出各工作部门之间各自为政，互不衔接的缺点。（王越毅）
