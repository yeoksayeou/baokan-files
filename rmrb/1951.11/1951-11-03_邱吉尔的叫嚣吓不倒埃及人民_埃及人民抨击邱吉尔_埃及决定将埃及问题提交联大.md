Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch:

    Cairo dispatch: Egyptian public opinion unanimously despises the rise to power of Winston Churchill, leader of the British Conservative Party, who once threatened to deal with Egypt with even harsher measures. During the election campaign, Churchill criticized the Labor government for taking too "cowardly" repressive measures in Egypt and repeatedly clamored to "unite" the United States and adopt a more resolute policy towards the Middle East. However, his bluster did not intimidate the Egyptian people.

    Egyptian newspapers, in commenting on the results of the British election, unanimously attacked Churchill, calling him the "number one imperialist," but at the same time emphasized that the Egyptian people would never be intimidated by Churchill. An editorial in the Egyptian "Akhbar El Yom" on October 27 said: "Now Churchill is the British Prime Minister, but if he believes he is the dictator of the world, then he is fooling himself." The newspaper added: "If he fantasizes that he can subdue the Egyptian people by using pressure, then he will have made a more serious mistake." If he uses force against Egypt, "he will dig his own grave." The newspaper said: "What will Churchill do? Any stupid thing he does will only strengthen the unity of the Egyptian people and Egypt's confidence and determination to gain freedom."

    The Egyptian "Al-Ahram" commented on Churchill's rise to power, saying: "The Egyptian people have nothing to fear, because their cause is just and reasonable, and their strength is much greater than the combined strength of the Conservatives and the Labor Party." "We feel no regret for the Labor Party's downfall, nor are we surprised by the Conservative Party's rise to power."

    Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch: According to a TASS dispatch on October 31 quoting the Egyptian "Gomhouria" newspaper: The Egyptian Council of Ministers has decided to submit the Egyptian question to the United Nations General Assembly, and will also submit to the United Nations General Assembly documents on the crimes committed by British troops in the Suez Canal Zone against women, children, and unarmed civilians. The newspaper pointed out that the Egyptian Council of Ministers has decided to request the United Nations General Assembly to adopt a resolution requiring British troops to withdraw from Egypt and Sudan.

    邱吉尔的叫嚣吓不倒埃及人民
    埃及人民抨击邱吉尔
    埃及决定将埃及问题提交联大
    【新华社二日讯】开罗讯：埃及舆论界对于曾经威胁要以更强硬手段对付埃及的英国保守党党魁邱吉尔的登台，一致予以藐视。邱吉尔在竞选时曾批评工党政府在埃及所采取的镇压措施太“懦弱”，并一再叫嚣要“团结”美国，对中东采取更坚决的政策。但是，他的叫嚣并没有吓倒埃及人民。
    埃及报纸在评论英国大选结果时，一致攻击邱吉尔，说他是“头号的帝国主义者”，但同时强调：埃及人民决不会被邱吉尔所吓倒。埃及“今日消息报”十月二十七日的社论说：“现在邱吉尔是英国的首相了，但是如果他相信他是世界上的独裁者，那么他就是愚弄自己。”该报又说：“如果他幻想使用压力就可以镇服埃及人民，那么他就犯了一次更严重的错误。”如果他对埃及使用武力，“他就会自掘坟墓”。该报说：“邱吉尔将有些什么作为呢？他所做的任何笨事，只会加强埃及全国人民的团结，以及埃及获得自由的信心与决心。”
    埃及“金字塔报”在评论邱吉尔登台时说：“埃及人民无所畏惧，因为他们的事业是正义的，有道理的，他们的力量比保守党分子和工党分子合起来的力量还强大得多。”“我们对工党的下台没有感到遗憾，也没有对保守党的上台感到任何惊奇。”
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社十月三十一日电引埃及“久米尔·米斯里报”消息：埃及大臣会议已决定将埃及问题提交联合国大会，同时将向联合国大会提出关于英国军队在苏彝士运河区对妇女、儿童和手无寸铁的平民所犯的罪行的文件。该报指出，埃及大臣会议已决定请求联合国大会通过决议，要求英国军队自埃及和苏丹撤退。
