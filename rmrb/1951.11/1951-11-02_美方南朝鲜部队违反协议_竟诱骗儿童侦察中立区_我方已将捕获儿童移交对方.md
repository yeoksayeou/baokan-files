    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 1st. At the joint meeting of liaison officers from both sides held on the afternoon of October 31st, our liaison officer, Senior Colonel Zhang Chunshan, handed over Kim Won-gi, a Korean child captured by our side for espionage activities, to the other side. Kim Won-gi was captured by the neutral zone military police at around 10:30 AM on October 12th while conducting reconnaissance near Panmunjom Bridge in the Kaesong neutral zone. After our side detained Kim Won-gi, the other side's liaison officer claimed at the October 21st liaison officer meeting that Kim Won-gi had entered the Kaesong neutral zone on October 12th following the other side's liaison officer's vehicle, and therefore requested the return of the child. When Senior Colonel Zhang Chunshan handed over Kim Won-gi to the other side's liaison officer, Colonel Kenny, on the 31st, he pointed out that the US side's South Korean troops' behavior of inducing Kim Won-gi to come to the neutral zone for reconnaissance work clearly violated the spirit of the neutral zone agreement. However, since the other side expressed willingness to take responsibility for Kim Won-gi's entry into the neutral zone, our side is willing to have the other side take back this induced child and return him to his parents. Senior Colonel Zhang Chunshan also pointed out that this is not the first time that South Korean troops have induced children to conduct reconnaissance work in the neutral zone, and he hoped that the other side would pay close attention to this and strictly restrain their South Korean troops from engaging in such behavior that violates the agreement and violates humanitarian principles.

    美方南朝鲜部队违反协议
    竟诱骗儿童侦察中立区
    我方已将捕获儿童移交对方
    【新华社开城一日电】在十月三十一日下午举行的双方联络官联合办事处的会议上，我方联络官张春山上校将我方捕获的一名从事间谍活动的朝鲜儿童金元基移交对方。金元基是在十月十二日上午十时三十分向开城中立区内板门桥附近进行侦察时，被中立区军事警察所捕获的。我方扣留金元基后，对方联络官曾在十月二十一日联络官会议上声称：金元基是在十月十二日追随着对方联络官的车辆进入开城中立区的，因此要求领回该孩童。张春山上校在三十一日把金元基移交对方联络官肯尼上校时指出：美方南朝鲜部队诱骗金元基前来中立区进行侦察工作的行为，显然是违反中立区协议的精神的。但是，既然对方表示愿对金元基之进入中立区负责，我方愿将这一被诱骗的孩童由对方领回交还他的父母。张春山上校并指出：南朝鲜部队诱骗儿童到中立区进行侦察工作已不仅这一次，希望对方对此切实予以注意，并严格约束对方南朝鲜部队不再做这种违反协议、违反人道的行为。
