Soldier Ruffian Fu Jiacheng Inhumanely Gouges Out Wife's Eyes
Fu Sentenced to Death by Leqing County People's Court

　　Fu Jiacheng, a soldier ruffian from Hebei Village, Panshi Town, Leqing County, Zhejiang Province, openly violated the Marriage Law and cruelly abused his wife, gouging out both of his wife Zhu Jinmei's eyes. The People's Government has sentenced the criminal Fu to death.
　　Fu Jiacheng had served as a soldier in the Kuomintang reactionary army and only returned to his hometown three months before the liberation of Leqing County in 1949. Last December, he married his cousin Zhu Jinmei. Zhu Jinmei's marriage to Fu Jiacheng was entirely arranged by her parents. After the marriage, Fu completely disregarded women's rights, forbidding Zhu Jinmei from going out freely or talking to neighboring women, and he tried every possible means to prevent her from joining the Women's Federation. He often threatened her, saying, "If you don't listen to me, I'll gouge out your eyes." Once, women from the village came to ask Zhu Jinmei to attend a meeting, and Fu Jiacheng even tore up the flag of the Women's Federation on the spot. When the Women's Federation mobilized Zhu Jinmei to eliminate pests, Fu Jiacheng sabotaged the effort, saying, "The insects fall from the sky, why eliminate them!" and cursed the women who were eliminating pests, dispersing them.
　　On August 15th this year, Zhu Jinmei asked to go home to visit her grandmother, who was seriously ill. Fu Jiacheng not only refused to allow her to go, but also used an iron hammer to hit Zhu Jinmei, causing her nose to bleed. After Fu Jiacheng scolded away the neighbors who came to dissuade him, he broke into the room, bolted the door, threw Zhu Jinmei to the ground, and tried to gouge out her eyes. Zhu Jinmei was so frightened that she covered her eyes with both hands and pleaded bitterly. The brutal Fu Jiacheng actually stepped on her hands with both feet and forcibly gouged out her left eye. At this critical moment of life and death, Zhu Jinmei mustered all her strength, struggled, and hid under the bed. Fu Jiacheng then dragged her out ferociously, intending to gouge out her right eye. Zhu Jinmei cried and pleaded, "Dear cousin, don't gouge out this eye, leave it for me to see, I would rather let you gouge out some pieces of my flesh." Fu Jiacheng refused and heartlessly gouged out her right eye. At this moment, the neighbors heard Zhu Jinmei's loud screams and could no longer bear it. They broke down the doors and windows to rescue her, only to see Zhu Jinmei had already fainted, her left eye hanging on her face like a snail meat, her right eye turned out of the eye socket, the eyeball already broken. When the neighbors wanted to try to give emergency treatment, the murderer Fu Jiacheng glared and stopped them, saying, "What are you afraid of? People won't die from gouging out their eyes." The Hebei Village militia immediately reported to the Panshi Town Public Security Sub-bureau and arrested and detained the murderer Fu Jiacheng, and urgently sent Zhu Jinmei to Wenzhou Hospital for treatment.
　　After this shocking tragedy occurred, it aroused public outrage among the local peasants. The Panshi Town Women's Federation held a special meeting of women representatives for this matter. The women representatives unanimously demanded that the People's Government severely punish the murderer Fu Jiacheng according to the law, in order to uphold justice and protect women's rights. The victim Zhu Jinmei and her father, as well as the peasants and women of Hebei Village, jointly accused Fu Jiacheng of his crimes to the Leqing County People's Court, demanding that the murderer be severely punished. After accepting this case, the county People's Court immediately cooperated with the Panshi Town Public Security Sub-bureau, the Panshi Town People's Government, and the Leqing County Democratic Women's Federation to conduct on-the-spot investigations of the truth of the incident three times. At the same time, they sent personnel to Wenzhou Bai Leid Hospital to express their condolences to the victim Zhu Jinmei and listen to Zhu Jinmei's accusations. After the investigation was verified, the county People's Court sentenced Fu Jiacheng to death on September 19th in accordance with the law. The local masses all expressed their support for this just judgment of the People's Government.

　  兵痞傅家成毫无人性地挖掉妻子眼睛
　  傅犯已被乐清县人民法院判处死刑
    浙江省乐清县磐石镇河北村兵痞傅家成，公然破坏婚姻法，残酷地虐待妻子，挖掉妻子诸金妹两只眼睛，人民政府已把傅犯判处死刑。
    傅家成曾在国民党反动军队当过兵，在一九四九年乐清县解放前三月才回乡，去年十二月跟他的表妹诸金妹结婚。诸金妹和傅家成婚事完全是她的父母包办的。婚后傅完全无视妇女权利，不准诸金妹自由外出，也不准同邻家妇女讲话，并百般阻止她参加妇女联合会。他常常威吓她说：“如果你不听我的话，挖掉你的眼睛。”有一次，村里的妇女来叫诸金妹去开会，傅家成竟当场把妇女联合会的旗子撕掉。妇女会来动员诸金妹去除虫，傅家成破坏说：“虫是天上掉下来的，除什么虫！”把除虫的妇女骂散了。
    今年八月十五日，诸金妹因祖母病重，请求回家探望，傅家成不但不允许她去，反而用铁锤打得诸金妹鼻血直流。傅家成把来劝解的邻人骂走后，又闯进房里把门闩起，把诸金妹摔倒地上，要挖她的眼睛。诸金妹吓得两手遮眼，苦苦哀求，残暴的傅家成竟用两脚踏住她的手，硬把她的左眼挖出来。在这生死关头，诸金妹拚出全身力气，挣扎着躲到床下，傅家成又凶狠的把她拖出来，要挖她的右眼。诸金妹哭着哀求说：“亲表哥，这只眼睛不要挖，剩给我看看吧，我宁愿给你挖几块肉去。”傅家成不肯，又狠心地把她的右眼挖破，这时邻人听见诸金妹高声惨叫，忍耐不住，大家打破门窗去救时，只见诸金妹已经晕去，左眼像田螺肉一样挂在脸上，右眼翻出在眼眶边，眼球已破。邻人要想法急救，凶手傅家成反而瞪眼阻止说：“怕什么，眼睛挖了人不会死的。”河北村民兵立即报告磐石镇公安分局将凶手傅家成逮捕扣押，另将诸金妹急送到温州医院去诊治。
    这桩骇人听闻的惨案发生以后，引起当地农民的公愤。磐石镇妇女联合会为这件事情专门开了妇女代表会，妇女代表们一致要求人民政府要依法严惩凶手傅家成，以伸张正气，保护妇女权利。被害人诸金妹和她的父亲以及河北村的农民、妇女们共同向乐清县人民法院控告傅家成的罪行，要求严办凶手。该县人民法院接受这一案件以后，立即协同磐石镇公安分局、磐石镇人民政府和乐清县民主妇联进行就地调查肇事真象三次，同时又派员到温州白累德医院慰问被害人诸金妹，并听取诸金妹的控诉。调查属实后，该县人民法院就在九月十九日依法判处傅家成以死刑。当地群众对人民政府这一正义的裁判，无不表示拥护。
