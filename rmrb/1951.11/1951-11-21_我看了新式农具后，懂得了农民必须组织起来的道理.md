    After Seeing New Farm Tools, I Understand the Reason Why Farmers Must Organize
    This time, I went to Tianjin to visit the North China Urban and Rural Material Exchange Exhibition. I truly saw the great creative power of the working class and felt the importance of urban-rural mutual assistance. There were so many industrial products in the exhibition that I couldn't name them all, many of which I had never seen before. For example, there is a machine that takes cotton in one end and produces cloth at the other; there is a tractor connected to a machine that reaps and threshes grain, producing rice directly. These are all made by our worker elders! I understand why the working class is the leading class. The exhibition also featured various agricultural products, such as cotton, walnuts, Sichuan pepper, hemp, and codonopsis, all of which are industrial raw materials. Even the flax stalks, which we in the countryside thought were useless for firewood, are valuable in Tianjin and are also industrial raw materials. During the visit, I also paid special attention to various new farm tools, such as weeding hoes and seven-inch and nine-inch walking plows. I examined them carefully and found them very suitable for use in our mountainous areas. This made me understand why we need urban-rural exchange and what to exchange. In the future, our farmers must organize to increase production and exchange for good farm tools and machines to produce more, and industrial and agricultural production will develop even further. Some farmers are unwilling to organize, which is a mistake. How can we buy tractors and various new farm tools for production without organizing? I saw a tractor plowing the land, and a hundred of our farmers couldn't match it. This is the road to agricultural collectivization and industrialization. This trip to Tianjin made me feel a great responsibility: I must tell these truths to all the farmers in our county and organize my village to do a good job in production, so that all the farmers in the county will move in this direction. As long as everyone puts in a little effort, realizing socialism in our country will be quick.

    我看了新式农具后，懂得了农民必须组织起来的道理
    今次我到天津参观华北区城乡物资交流展览会，真正看到了工人阶级的伟大创造力量，同时感到城乡互助真是重要。展览会中各种工业品多得说不完，很多是我从来没有见过的，例如有种机器，这头放进棉花，那头就出来布；有种拖拉机连着一架机器，收谷时连收带打，出来就是米；这些都是工人老大哥制造的哩！我明白了工人阶级为什么是领导阶级。展览会里还有各种农业品，如棉花、核桃、花椒、麻、党参等等，这都是工业原料。连那胡麻杆，咱们在乡下认为没用处，当烧柴，不料在天津也值钱，也是工业原料。参观时，我还特别注意各种新式农具，如耘锄和七吋、九吋的步犁等，我仔细端详了，觉得都很适合咱山地使用。这一来，我明白了为什么要城乡交流和交流什么。以后咱农民必须组织起来，才能增加产量，换回好农具、好机器生产，增产就更多，工农业生产也就更发展。有些农民不愿组织起来，真是想错了，不组织起来那能购买拖拉机和各种新式农具生产呢？我看到一架拖拉机犁地，咱一百个农民也顶不上，这就是农业集体化工业化的道路。我今次到天津跑了一趟，感到自己的责任很大，就是我要把这些道理告诉咱全县农民，并且要把我这村组织起来搞好生产，叫全县农民都朝这方向走。只要大家加一把力，在咱国家实现社会主义也很快。
