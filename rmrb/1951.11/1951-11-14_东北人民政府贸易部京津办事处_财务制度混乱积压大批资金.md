　　Northeast People's Government Trade Department Beijing-Tianjin Office
    Chaotic Financial System Accumulates Large Amounts of Funds
    The financial management system of the Northeast People's Government Trade Department's Beijing-Tianjin Office is chaotic, resulting in the long-term accumulation of circulating funds. This situation is manifested in the following aspects: First, the phenomenon of "man-made fund travel" occurs frequently. The Panshi County Company, affiliated with the China Native Produce Company of Jilin Province, sent one train car of flax and one train car of hemp seeds to the office in May; these two batches of goods have not yet been fully processed. The office sold a batch of flax to the Gongzhuling Native Produce Company and remitted the proceeds to the Jilin Province Native Produce Company on August 13, but did not specify what the payment was for. The Jilin Province Native Produce Company inquired three times before the office replied in early September. This payment was thus held up for a month. On June 22, the office remitted an "unnamed payment" of over 89 million yuan to the Jilin Province Native Produce Company. It was not until late July that the Jilin Province Native Produce Company clarified the source of this payment, but it had already been held up for nearly a month. Second, the accounts are unclear and the procedures are too chaotic, often leading to erroneous remittances. In June, the office sent a balance reconciliation statement to the Gongzhuling Native Produce Company, stating 10,231,305 yuan. The Gongzhuling Native Produce Company found discrepancies upon verification and immediately wrote to inquire, only to find that the office had overstated the amount by 1,421,750 yuan. The office once mistakenly remitted the sales proceeds of the Nong'an County Company to the Changchun County Company, and vice versa. Third, internal work order is chaotic, and there is often a lack of coordination. In June, the Shuangyang Native Produce Store sent 98 packages of hemp seeds and 320 packages of small hemp seeds to the office. The Storage and Transportation Section received them, but they had not been fully processed by the end of July. The Shuangyang Native Produce Store sent a letter to inquire, and the office initially denied the matter, but later discovered it after checking the accounts.
    Due to the above reasons, the office has caused serious losses to the state. This lesson should be remembered.

　　东北人民政府贸易部京津办事处
    财务制度混乱积压大批资金
    东北人民政府贸易部京津办事处财务管理制度混乱，长期积压流动资金。这种情况表现在下列几个方面：一、经常发生“人为的资金旅行”的现象。中国土产公司吉林省公司所属磐石县公司，五月份发给该处一车皮线麻、一车皮大麻籽；这两批货物，至今尚未处理完。该处给公主岭土产公司卖了一批线麻，于八月十三日将卖款解往吉林省土产公司，但未说明这是什么款项。吉林省土产公司询问三次，该处始于九月上旬答复。这笔款就这样积压了一个月。六月二十二日，该处汇给吉林省土产公司“无名款”一笔，计八千九百余万元。直到七月下旬，吉林省土产公司才查清这笔款的来由，但已积压将近一月。二、账目不清，手续太乱，常发生解错款的现象。六月份该处发给公主岭土产公司一张余额对账单，写着一○、二三一、三○五元。公主岭土产公司查对不符，即写信询问，原来是该处多写了一、四二一、七五○元。该处曾将农安县公司的销货款错解到长春县公司，而将长春县公司的销货款错解到农安县公司。三、内部工作秩序混乱，常发生互不衔接的现象。双阳土产商店六月份给该处发去大麻籽九十八包，小麻籽三百二十包，该处储运科接收了，但直至七月末仍未处理完。双阳土产商店致函询问，该处起初说并无此事，后经查账，才发现了。
    由于上述原因，该处给国家造成了严重的损失。这种教训，是应该记取的。
