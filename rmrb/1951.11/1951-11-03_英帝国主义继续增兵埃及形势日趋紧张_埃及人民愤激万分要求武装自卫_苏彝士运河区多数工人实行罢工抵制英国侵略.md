Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. The Egyptian people are continuing to wage a resolute struggle against the atrocities of the British occupation army and for the withdrawal of British troops.

As the British government continues to massively reinforce its troops, the situation in Egypt is becoming increasingly tense. In addition to the 100,000 British troops already stationed in the Suez Canal Zone, the British government has recently transferred the 16th Independent Parachute Brigade, originally stationed in Cyprus, and the "South Lancashire Regiment," originally stationed in Trieste, to Egypt. On October 26, the British 19th Infantry Brigade began round-the-clock airlift from Longham Airport in Wiltshire, England, to Libya in preparation for deployment to Egypt. On October 30, the British War Office also announced that the British 3rd Infantry Division "has been ordered to the Middle East." The British government's massive troop increase in Egypt indicates that it is actively preparing to suppress the Egyptian people's just struggle by force. According to a report in the Egyptian "Mukattem" newspaper on October 29, Britain is planning to "occupy all of Egypt by force with the help of the United States."

At the same time, incidents of British occupation forces stationed in the Suez Canal Zone arbitrarily provoking incidents and shooting Egyptian people continue to occur. According to an announcement by the Egyptian government on October 30, since October 16, nineteen Egyptians have been killed by British troops and one hundred and twenty-five have been wounded by British troops.

However, the Egyptian people, supported by the people of the Middle East and the people of the world, are resolutely opposing Britain's military provocations and intimidation. In various parts of the Suez Canal Zone, an average of 72 percent of workers have gone on strike. On the 29th, Egyptian lighthouse keepers went on strike, bringing night traffic on the Suez Canal to a standstill. In the Tell al-Kebir area, about 80 percent of the Egyptian workers working for the British army have left the British army camps. Sailors of tugboats and barges in Port Said and dockworkers in Suez are continuing to strike. Not only that, the indignant Egyptian people have demanded to respond to Britain's prepared armed attack with armed resistance. 10,000 university students in Cairo have requested the organization of a "National Guard." According to a report from the Telegraph Agency: 5,000 Egyptians have volunteered to join the "Liberation Army Corps" commanded by former Egyptian Chief of Staff General Maschali. The Egyptian government has also begun to take precautionary measures regarding the current serious situation. The Egyptian Council of State passed a manpower mobilization bill on October 28, stipulating that all Egyptian men between the ages of 18 and 50 shall be drafted into the army in "cases of war or threat of war." The Council of State also decided to establish a Supreme Military Committee headed by Prime Minister Nahas.

    英帝国主义继续增兵埃及形势日趋紧张
    埃及人民愤激万分要求武装自卫
    苏彝士运河区多数工人实行罢工抵制英国侵略
    【新华社二日讯】埃及人民正继续为反对英国占领军的暴行，为要求英军的撤退，进行坚决的斗争。
    由于英国政府仍在不断地大量增兵，埃及的形势正日趋紧张。除了原来驻在苏彝士运河区的十万英军外，英国政府最近已把原来驻在塞浦路斯的第十六伞兵独立旅和原来驻在的里雅斯特的“南兰开夏团”，调到了埃及。十月二十六日，英国第十九步兵旅开始从英国尉尔特郡的龙汉机场夜以继日地空运到利比亚，准备前往埃及。十月三十日，英国陆军部又宣布，英国步兵第三师，“已奉命调往中东”。英国政府的大量增兵埃及，表明它正在积极准备武力镇压埃及人民的正义斗争。据埃及“穆干特姆”报十月二十九日报道，英国正计划“在美国的帮助下武力占领全埃及”。
    与此同时，驻在苏彝士运河区的英国占领军部队，任意寻衅枪杀埃及人民的事件，仍在继续发生。据埃及政府十月三十日宣布：自十月十六日以来，已有十九个埃及人被英军击毙，一百二十五人被英军击伤。
    但是，受到中东各国人民及全世界人民支持的埃及人民，正坚决地反对英国的武力挑衅和恫吓。在苏彝士运河区各地，平均有百分之七十二的工人已实行罢工。二十九日，埃及灯塔看守人举行罢工，使苏彝士运河的夜间交通陷于停顿。在特勒·厄尔·凯比尔地区，约有百分之八十为英军工作的埃及工人已离开英军军营。塞得港拖船和驳船的水手以及苏彝士港的码头工人，都在继续举行罢工。不仅如此，愤激的埃及人民已要求以武装抵抗来回答英国正在准备的武装进攻。开罗的一万大学生，已要求组织“国民警卫队”。另据电通社消息：已有五千埃及人自愿参加埃及前参谋长马歇里将军指挥下的“解放军团”。埃及政府对于目前严重的局势，亦开始采取准备的措施。埃及国务会议在十月二十八日通过人力总动员法案，规定在“战争或战争威胁的情况下”征召所有的十八岁至五十岁的埃及男子入伍。国务会议并决定成立以纳哈斯首相为首的最高军事委员会。
