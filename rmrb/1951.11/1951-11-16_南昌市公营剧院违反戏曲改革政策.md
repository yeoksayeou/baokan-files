　　Nanchang City Public Theaters Violate Opera Reform Policies
    The Jiangxi Workers' Theater, run by the Jiangxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions in Nanchang City, and the Victory Troupe of the Jiangxi Military Region, on the pretext that performing new plays was not profitable, went to various places to hire famous actors and actresses to perform plays such as "The Great Coffin Splitting," "Zhong Kui," and "Si Lang Visits His Mother," and raised ticket prices. The Jiangxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions simply removed the word "Worker" from the Jiangxi Workers' Theater and performed old plays on a large scale. They also used vulgar phrases such as "Grand scenes, amazing scenery, lingering affection, fragrant and gentle"; "Turtles move house all over the stage, real fire burns down Jinshan Temple," "Giant turtles, extra-large rats," and "Little Aunt's Amorous Feelings" to promote the performances widely. The Yangtze River Daily criticized this phenomenon on May 6, but they ignored it. The newspaper again criticized the leadership policy of the Jiangxi Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles on September 26. The Jiangxi Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles made a review in the Jiangxi Daily on October 18, believing that the public theaters' failure to carry out opera reform work well was closely related to the thinking of the cadres managing the theaters. Because the responsible comrades of the theaters did not have a sufficient understanding of the purpose of opera propaganda and lacked confidence in opera reform work, they proceeded purely from business profits and losses; and the leading organs adopted an attitude of accommodation and indulgence towards these errors, which caused the above errors. The Jiangxi Daily also published a short commentary on the same day.
    The public Jiangxi Theater and the Victory Troupe's performance of superstitious and erotic plays from a purely economic point of view has already created a very bad effect among the audience. After being criticized by the Yangtze River Daily, they adopted an attitude of ignoring it, and the local competent authorities and the Jiangxi Federation of Literary and Art Circles turned a blind eye to this serious phenomenon. They did not take a positive attitude after the Yangtze River Daily's criticism and quickly correct the erroneous policy of the theater and troupe. This is obviously a kind of political paralysis and must be thoroughly corrected.

　　南昌市公营剧院违反戏曲改革政策
    南昌市江西省总工会经营的江西工人剧院和江西军区的胜利剧团，藉口排演新戏不卖座，到各地争聘名角，演出“大劈棺”、“钟馗”、“四郎探母”等戏，并抬高票价。江西省总工会索性将江西工人剧院的“工人”二字取消，大演旧戏。并且用“场面伟大，布景惊奇，情丝绵绵，香艳温软”；“乌龟满台大搬家，真火漫烧金山寺”、“斗大乌龟、特大老鼠”及“小姨多情”等下流词句广事宣传。长江日报曾于五月六日针对此种现象提出批评，但他们竟置之不理。该报又于九月二十六日批评江西省文学艺术界联合会的领导方针。江西省文学艺术界联合会十月十八日在江西日报上作了检讨，认为公营剧院不能很好地进行戏曲改革工作，是与经营剧院的干部思想密切关联的。由于剧院负责同志对戏曲的宣传目的认识不足，对戏曲改革工作缺乏信心，单纯地从营业盈亏出发；而领导机关对这些错误采取了迁就、姑息的态度，这就造成了以上错误。江西日报并于同日发表短评。
    公营江西剧院及胜利剧团从单纯经济观点出发演出迷信色情的剧目，已在观众中造成很坏的效果，经长江日报批评后竟采取置之不理的态度，以及当地主管机关及江西文学艺术界联合会对此种严重现象竟熟视无睹，没有在长江日报批评后采取积极的态度，迅速纠正该剧院及剧团的错误方针，这显然是一种政治上的麻痹现象，必须彻底纠正。
