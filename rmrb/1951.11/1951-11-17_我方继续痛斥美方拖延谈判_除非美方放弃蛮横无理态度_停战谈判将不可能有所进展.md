Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th -- At the Korean armistice negotiation subcommittee meeting on the 16th, our representative denounced the other side's sophistry, claiming that the other side's November 11th proposal had already determined when and how to determine the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone. Our representative pointed out that the determination of the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone, as well as the two different times for the implementation of this clause, are not allowed to be confused. Although the cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of both sides from the demilitarized zone will begin after the signing of the armistice agreement, according to the order of the agenda and its content, the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone must be specifically determined in the discussion of the second item on the agenda; and after the entire armistice agreement is agreed upon, the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone must be revised according to the changes in the line of contact. However, the other side's proposal attempts to postpone the determination of the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone to the time of signing the armistice agreement, fully proving that the other side is intentionally attempting to overturn the provisions of the agenda and delay the progress of the armistice negotiations. Our representative pointed out that abiding by the agenda already agreed upon by both sides is the most basic expression of sincerity in the armistice negotiations. However, the other side's representative blatantly stated again at the subcommittee meeting on November 16 that since our side does not accept the other side's so-called adjustment plan attempting to occupy our Kaesong area, the other side cannot agree to immediately determine the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone. Our representative sternly pointed out that the other side's arrogant and unreasonable attitude of "If you don't give me Kaesong, I will refuse to determine the military demarcation line" can only be interpreted as intentionally delaying or even undermining the armistice negotiations, and there can be no other explanation. Unless the other side abandons this arrogant and unreasonable attitude, the armistice negotiations cannot make any progress.

　　我方继续痛斥美方拖延谈判
    除非美方放弃蛮横无理态度
    停战谈判将不可能有所进展
    【新华社开城十六日电】十六日的朝鲜停战谈判小组委员会上，我方代表痛斥对方的诡辩所谓对方的十一月十一日建议已经决定了何时以及如何确定军事分界线和非军事区。我方代表指出：军事分界线和非军事区的确定，以及这一条款付之实施的两个不同的时间，是不容许混淆的。虽然敌对行动的停止和双方自非军事区的撤出，将在停战协议签字后开始，但根据议程的次序及其内容，军事分界线和非军事区必须在第二项议程的讨论中具体确定；而在停战协议全部商定后，军事分界线和非军事区必须按照接触线所发生的变化加以修正。但对方的建议中，却企图将军事分界线和非军事区的确定推延到停战协议签字之时，充分证明对方是有意的企图推翻议程的规定，并拖延停战谈判的进行。我方代表指出：遵守双方已经协议的议程，是对停战谈判的诚意的最起码的表现。但对方代表却在十一月十六日的小组会上再度公然表示，既然我方不接受对方企图占有我方开城地区的所谓调整方案，则对方即不能同意即行确定军事分界线和非军事区。我方代表严词指出：对方这种“你不给我开城，我就拒绝确定军事分界线”的横蛮无理态度，除了是有意拖延，乃至不惜破坏停战谈判外，不可能有任何其他的解释。除非对方放弃这种横蛮无理态度，停战谈判是不可能有所进展的。
