    Readjustments Made to Departments and Faculties in East China's Universities and Colleges
    To meet the needs of national construction and improve teaching effectiveness, appropriate adjustments have been made to relevant departments and faculties in East China's universities and colleges.
    According to the instructions of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, the East China Military and Political Committee's Department of Education established East China Normal University based on Guanghua University and Great China University. It also incorporated the Department of Education of Fudan University, the Department of Zoology and Botany of Tongji University, the Department of Music of Shanghai University, and the East Asia Physical Education College into the university to concentrate efforts on training teachers for secondary schools.
    Key departments and disciplines in the engineering colleges of various universities have also been adjusted. Jiaotong University originally had three colleges: Science, Engineering, and Management. In this adjustment, the departments of the Management College were merged into Northern Jiaotong University and Shanghai College of Finance and Economics, respectively. The Department of Industrial Management Engineering of the Engineering College of the university was merged into the Department of Mechanical Engineering, and the Department of Marine Engineering was merged into the Department of Naval Architecture. The Department of Aeronautical Engineering of Xiamen University was merged into the Department of Aeronautical Engineering of Tsinghua University. The Departments of Civil Engineering of Guanghua University and Great China University were merged into Tongji University, and the Departments of Finance and Economics, Politics, and Law were merged into Fudan University and Shanghai College of Finance and Economics, respectively. The Department of Civil Engineering of the College of Science of Fudan University was merged into the Department of Civil Engineering of the Engineering College of Jiaotong University. The Department of Textile Engineering of Jiaotong University, Shanghai Textile Engineering College, and the Department of Textile Engineering of Shanghai Industrial College were merged to form East China Textile Engineering College, which is led by the East China Textile Bureau and specializes in training textile engineering talents. Nanjing Industrial College was renamed East China Transportation College and is led by the Transportation Department of the East China Military and Political Committee. Zhejiang University Medical College and Zhejiang Provincial Medical College were merged to form Zhejiang Medical College. The private Shanghai College of Politics and Law, Chengming College of Arts and Sciences, New China College of Commerce and Law, New China College, the Department of Law of Shanghai Law College, and Guangxia Commercial College were merged to form the private Shanghai College. Higher education institutions that previously received foreign subsidies: Nanjing University and Ginling Women's College were merged to form the public Nanjing University. Hwa Nan Women's College of Arts and Sciences of Fuzhou and Fukien Christian University were merged to form the public Fuzhou University. Shanghai Aurora University and Aurora Women's College of Arts and Sciences were merged into the private Aurora University. Qilu University abolished the College of Arts and Sciences, and the Departments of Literature and History of the university were merged into Shandong University. Shandong University also added the Department of Mining and Metallurgy. Some other private higher education institutions, because they did not meet the conditions for higher education institutions, were changed to secondary technical schools; a few schools were decided to be closed down due to poor teaching conditions.
    The original departments and faculties of higher education institutions in East China were duplicated and extremely unreasonable. Before this adjustment, there were 75 public and private higher education institutions in the region, with 548 departments and disciplines. The same department or discipline was offered in several schools, so that under the existing equipment and teachers, it was impossible to concentrate efforts to improve the teaching effect. These schools also lacked a clear mission and focus due to the complexity of the departments and disciplines. The conditions of teachers and equipment in many schools were very poor. Some schools had no full-time teachers at all, or courses were set up without professors; some schools had only two or three rooms and lacked the necessary equipment. This resulted in a serious waste of manpower and material resources. In order to change this unreasonable situation, strengthen the leadership of public and private higher education institutions, and concentrate efforts to run well-conditioned departments and disciplines, the East China Military and Political Committee convened the East China Higher Education Engineering College Departments Adjustment Conference in April this year, first adjusting the departments of public schools such as Jiaotong University, Fudan University, Shandong University, and Shanghai College of Finance and Economics. The adjustment of these school departments proceeded relatively smoothly and played a certain role in promoting other public and private schools. Secondly, before the opening of school in the spring and during the enrollment work in the summer vacation this year, the department successively stopped enrollment in seven schools and thirty-two departments with very poor conditions. Schools with smaller scales and poor teaching conditions were either merged, reorganized, or closed down. After this adjustment, the number of public and private higher education institutions in the region was reduced to 59, and the number of departments and disciplines was reduced to 404. The tasks and priorities of each school were clarified, and they were equipped with the conditions to concentrate efforts to improve teaching.
    In this adjustment of departments and faculties in East China's higher education institutions, the spirit of "taking care of the overall situation, uniting as one, and running schools well" was implemented. At the same time, practical difficulties faced by staff were taken care of; therefore, the work generally proceeded smoothly. In the process of adjustment, some personnel and treatment issues arising from the merger of schools were also properly resolved due to the increased political awareness of teachers over the past two years.

    华东区高等学校院系已作适当调整
    为了适应国家建设需要和提高教学效果，华东区高等学校有关院系已作了适当的调整。
    根据中央人民政府教育部的指示，华东军政委员会教育部以光华大学、大夏大学两校为基础，成立了华东师范大学，并将复旦大学教育系、同济大学动物系和植物系、沪江大学音乐系和东亚体育专科学校并入该校，以集中力量，培养中等学校师资。
    各高等学校工学院的重点系、科也进行了调整。交通大学原有理、工、管理三个学院，这次调整中将管理学院各系分别并入北方交通大学和上海财政经济学院。该校工学院的工业管理工程系并入机械系，轮机工程系并入造船系。厦门大学航空工程系并入清华大学航空工程学院。光华大学、大夏大学的土木工程系、科并入同济大学，财经、政治、法律等系分别并入复旦大学和上海财经学院。复旦大学理学院的土木工程系并入交通大学工学院土木工程系。交通大学纺织工程系和上海纺织工学院、上海工业专科学校纺织科合并成立华东纺织工学院，由华东区纺织管理局领导，专门培养纺织工程人才。南京工业专科学校改为华东交通专科学校，由华东军政委员会交通部领导。浙江大学医学院和浙江省立医学院合并改为浙江医学院。私立的上海法政学院、诚明文学院、新中国法商学院、新中国学院、上海法学院法律系、光夏商业专科学校等合并成立私立上海学院。过去接受外国津贴的高等学校：金陵大学和金陵女子文理学院合并改为公立金陵大学。福州华南女子文理学院与协和大学合并改为公立福州大学。上海震旦大学与震旦女子文理学院合并为私立震旦大学。齐鲁大学将文学院取销，将该校文学系、历史学系并入山东大学。山东大学还增设了采矿冶金系。其他私立高等学校，有的因不合高等学校条件，改为中等技术学校；有少数学校因教学条件太差，决定停办。
    华东区原有的高等学校院系重复，极不合理。这次调整以前共有公私立高等学校七十五所，其中有系、科达五百四十八个。同一个系、科在好几个学校开设，以致在现有设备和教师的条件下，不能集中力量，提高教学效果。这些学校也由于系、科庞杂，以致任务和重点很不明确。有许多学校的师资、设备等条件很差，有的学校甚至完全没有专任教师，或虚设了课程，无人教授；有的学校只有两三个房间，缺乏必要的设备。这样就造成人力物力上严重的浪费。华东军政委员会为了改变这种不合理的情况，加强对公私立高等学校的领导，集中力量办好条件较好的系、科，在今年四月间召开了华东区高等学校工学院院系调整会议，首先将交通大学、复旦大学、山东大学、上海财经学院等公立学校的系科，加以调整。这些学校系科的调整，进行得比较顺利，对其他公、私立学校起了一定的推动作用。其次，该部在今年春季开学以前和今年暑假的招生工作中，先后停止条件很差的七个学校和三十二个系科招生。对规模较小，师资条件较差的学校，分别予以合并、改组或停办。经过这次调整，全区公私立高等学校减为五十九所，系、科减为四百零四个，各校的任务和重点明确，并具备了集中力量，改进教学的条件。
    华东区在这次高等学校院系调整中，贯彻了“照顾整体，团结一致，办好学校”的精神，同时对有实际困难的工作人员予以切实照顾；因此，工作进行一般是顺利的。在调整过程中，因并校而发生的一些人事、待遇等问题，也由于两年来教师们的政治觉悟的提高，得到了适当的解决。（新华社）
