    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 24th. The "Democratic Korea" newspaper published an editorial on the 23rd, warmly endorsing the Soviet peace proposals submitted to the United Nations General Assembly, and vehemently denouncing the deceptive "disarmament" proposals of the imperialists. The editorial stated: The Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly sharply and clearly reflects two different political lines: one is the political line of maintaining peace, headed by the Soviet Union, and the other is the political line of instigating a new war, headed by US imperialism. The proposals put forward by the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, at the UN General Assembly on November 8th and the supplementary proposals on the 16th, are the most effective and reasonable proposals to eliminate the threat of another world war and ensure world peace and security. They will undoubtedly be welcomed and supported by the Korean people and the people of the world. The suggestions of Truman, Acheson, and the like, and the suggestions of the United States, Britain, and France, are merely empty talk about "disarmament," and their purpose is to cover up their conspiracy to intensify war preparations.
    The editorial concluded: Facts speak louder than words. Any deception by the aggressive bloc headed by US imperialism will not work among the Korean people and the people of the world. The Korean people believe that the political line of instigating a new war is a line that threatens the peace and security of mankind, and only the political line of maintaining peace under the leadership of the Soviet Union can guarantee the freedom, independence, and honor of the Korean people. The just proposals of the Soviet delegation, especially the reasonable proposal for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, have inspired the Korean people's confidence in victory. We are deeply convinced that the path of peace will surely defeat the path of war of the aggressors.

    “民主朝鲜”报发表社论
    拥护苏联和平建议
    【新华社平壤二十四日电】“民主朝鲜”报二十三日发表社论，热烈拥护苏联在联合国大会上提出的和平建议，痛斥帝国主义者所谓“裁减军备”的欺骗性建议。社论说：联合国第六届大会尖锐而明确地反映了两条不同的政治路线，一条是以苏联为首的维护和平的政治路线，另一条是以美帝国主义为首的挑拨新战争的政治路线。苏联代表团团长维辛斯基十一月八日在联合国大会上提出的建议和十六日提出的补充建议，是消除另一次世界大战的威胁和保障世界和平与安全的最有效、最合理的提案，它无疑要受到朝鲜人民和全世界人民的欢迎和支持。杜鲁门、艾奇逊之流及美英法三国建议侈谈“裁减军备”，其目的在于掩盖他们加紧战争准备的阴谋。
    社论最后说：事实胜于空谈，以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团的任何欺骗在朝鲜人民和全世界人民中是不能生效的。朝鲜人民认为，挑拨新战争的政治路线是威胁人类的和平与安全的路线，只有在苏联领导下的维护和平的政治路线才能保障朝鲜人民的自由、独立和荣誉。苏联代表团的公正建议，特别是和平解决朝鲜问题的合理主张，已鼓舞了朝鲜人民的胜利信心。我们深信和平的路线一定能够打败侵略者的战争路线。
