　　After Chairman Mao issued the call for increasing production, practicing economy, and continuing to strengthen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea at the Third Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Party organizations and people from all walks of life across the country responded enthusiastically. The Northeast Bureau, Southwest Bureau, East China Bureau, North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and the Shanghai Municipal Committee, successively held meetings of Party member cadres, where responsible comrades of the Party made reports on the increase production and practice economy campaign. Under the leadership and promotion of Party organizations at all levels, many factories, enterprises, and government organizations have already begun practical actions to increase production and practice economy. This movement has only just begun; promoting this movement so that it truly has a national scale, penetrates every region and every unit, and has a huge impact, is the primary task of various regions for a considerable period in the future. In order to promote the smooth progress of this work, the methods proposed by the Shanghai Municipal Committee are worth advocating. (See today's first page of this newspaper for the article). That is: the responsible cadres of the Party Committee should personally take action, organize mass democratic inspections; educate every Party member to lead the broad masses with their own exemplary actions; industrial and mining enterprises, as well as government agencies and organizations, should formulate practical and feasible specific conservation plans and implement them.

　　党委要加强增产节约运动的思想领导
    毛主席在人民政协全国委员会第三次会议上发出增加生产、厉行节约、继续加强抗美援朝运动的号召以后，全国各地党的组织和各界人民热烈响应。中共中央东北局、西南局、华东局、华北局和上海市委员会等，先后都召开了党员干部大会，由党的负责同志作了关于增产节约运动的报告。在各级党的组织领导和推动下，不少工厂企业和机关已经开始了增产节约的实际行动。这个运动还刚刚开始；推进这个运动使它真正具有全国规模、深入每个地区每一单位并发生巨大作用，是各地今后一个相当长时期内的首要任务。为了推动这一工作的顺利进行，上海市委所提出的办法是值得提倡的。（该文见今日本报一版）这就是：党委的负责干部亲自动手，组织群众性的民主检查；教育每一个党员以自己的模范行动来带动广大群众；工矿企业以及机关团体，应制订切实可行的具体节约方案，贯彻执行。
