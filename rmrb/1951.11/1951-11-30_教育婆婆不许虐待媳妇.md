    Educating Mothers-in-Law to Forbid the Abuse of Daughters-in-Law

    The abuse of daughters-in-law by mothers-in-law is a self-inflicted torment among oppressed women. In the old society, this phenomenon of self-inflicted torment was widespread and developed to a very cruel extent. Some mothers-in-law even beat their daughters-in-law to death or killed them. For many years, many women have not escaped this tragic fate. Today, the people's revolution has triumphed, and a new democratic political and economic system has been established, women can break away from this tragic fate. However, many mothers-in-law have not yet realized this, and they still use the methods that mothers-in-law used to treat themselves in the past to treat their daughters-in-law. As a result, unfortunate events continue to occur, and the suffering of many women cannot be relieved. If this situation is not changed, a truly civilized and happy family cannot appear. Even social order and national construction will be affected.
    The Yongxingchang Township in Songzi County, Hubei Province, held a mothers-in-law meeting to promote the Marriage Law, the benefits of harmony and cooperation between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, and the harms of mothers-in-law abusing daughters-in-law. Facts have proved that this is one of the effective methods to change the feudal minds of mothers-in-law and overcome the phenomenon of abusing daughters-in-law. When cadres guided the mothers-in-law to think about the suffering they had suffered from abuse in the past and the harms of family discord, their thinking gradually became clear, and some have already put it into action. Of course, we cannot hope to solve all problems with education methods. Some unfortunate events caused by mothers-in-law abusing daughters-in-law must be dealt with according to the law; some women who firmly demand a divorce because they are abused by their mothers-in-law, we must support them. However, if we can educate the general mothers-in-law about the Marriage Law in the propaganda and implementation of the Marriage Law, many problems in the relationship between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law can be solved. It is hoped that all localities will learn from the experience of Yongxingchang Township and educate mothers-in-law well according to the specific circumstances.

### 教育婆婆不许虐待媳妇

    教育婆婆不许虐待媳妇
    婆婆虐待媳妇，是受压迫的妇女的自相煎迫。在旧社会里，这种自相煎迫的现象是普遍的，而且发展到十分残忍的程度。有的婆婆甚至打死或杀死媳妇。许多年代，许多妇女都没有摆脱了这种悲惨的命运。今天，人民革命胜利了，新民主主义的政治经济制度建立了，妇女们可以摆脱这种悲惨的命运了。但是，有许多婆婆还没有觉悟到这一点，她们仍然沿用着从前婆婆对待自己的方法去对待自己的媳妇。于是不幸的事件继续发生着，许多妇女的痛苦仍然不能解除。这种情况如不改变，就不可能出现真正文明幸福的家庭。甚至社会秩序和国家建设，都会受到影响。
    湖北省松滋县永兴场乡召开婆婆会，宣传婚姻法，宣传婆媳和睦合作的好处和婆婆虐待媳妇的害处，事实证明这是改变婆婆封建脑筋和克服虐待媳妇的现象的有效方法之一。当着干部引导婆婆们想到自己从前受虐待的苦处和家庭不睦的害处时，她们的思想就渐渐想通了，有的并已见之于行动。当然，我们不能希望以教育方法解决所有的问题。有些因婆婆虐待媳妇而造成的不幸事件，必须依法处理；有些妇女因受婆婆虐待而坚决要求离婚的，我们必须予以支持。但是，如果在宣传与执行婚姻法中对一般婆婆都能进行关于婚姻法的教育，有许多婆媳关系问题是可以得到解决的。希望各地根据具体情况，吸取永兴场乡的经验，好好教育婆婆。
