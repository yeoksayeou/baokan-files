    Tianjin Factory Nursery Workers and Maternal and Child Health Workers
    Ensure Mothers Complete Production Tasks
    In order to alleviate the specific difficulties faced by female workers in the production competition movement and enable them to achieve victories on the production front like their male counterparts, Tianjin's factory nursery workers and maternal and child health personnel launched a patriotic work competition movement starting in April this year.
    The primary tasks of factory nursery work and maternal and child health work are to care for children, ensure their health, and enable female workers to complete or exceed their production targets. Everyone has completed this task. For example, during the competition, 82 children at the Tianjin State-Owned No. 1 Cotton Mill contracted measles. The nursery not only concentrated the children with measles for care, with the caregivers working day and night in shifts, but also mobilized doctors in the city to treat the children. All 82 children eventually recovered. Not a single mother took leave during the three weeks. The Tianjin State-Owned No. 3 Cotton Mill strengthened the system of division of labor and responsibility through the competition. Caregivers and mothers formed competition groups, competing to see which group's caregivers took better care of the children and which mothers earned more red flags in production. As a result, 43 out of 134 mothers in the factory won award flags during the competition. When model workers were elected throughout the city this year, the factory's nursery was selected as a model nursery. Because the nursery's work closely cooperated with the production movement, the nursery itself also greatly improved; therefore, the mothers were very happy. Many mothers said, "The children are getting so fat now! The caregivers not only care about our children but also care about the mothers' work and study. We must produce well!"
    The main reasons why nursery work in Tianjin factories has achieved success are:
    Everyone recognizes that the factory nursery is part of the factory and that the nursery work competition is a link in the factory's production competition; therefore, the factory administration, Party branch, and Communist Youth League must strengthen their leadership over the nursery to ensure that the competition work is done even better. For example, the directors, Party branch secretaries, and trade union chairmen of the Tianjin State-Owned Nos. 2 and 3 Cotton Mills personally directed the work of the nurseries.
    After each nursery formulated a specific and clear competition plan, the Women's Federation cooperated with the trade union to send cadres to the factories with a focus on providing specific assistance. During the competition, the Tianjin State-Owned No. 3 Cotton Mill first united all forces, strengthened ideological education for the caregivers, established a dedicated responsibility system, and adopted a meticulous division of labor method. At the same time, when students from the Nursery Department of Beijing Normal University came to Tianjin for internships, short-term study classes for nursery directors and class leaders were held, promoting new childcare experiences and methods and introducing new childcare systems, which played a role in promoting the competition work of various nurseries. In order to ensure the implementation of the competition plans of various nurseries, inspection work is necessary. During the competition, the Women's Federation and the Women Workers' Department of the Trade Union organized mutual inspections among the nurseries and organized visits. After the inspections, they also convened symposiums for the heads of the nurseries to improve future work.
    The Women's Federation, in coordination with the trade union, united medical workers to carry out maternal and child health work in various factories. For example, they held lectures on hygiene knowledge, mobilized primary schools and reformed midwives to perform hygiene plays in the factories, established a dormitory hygiene duty system and workshop hygiene groups, and established a reward system, as well as setting up health canteens for pregnant women. In factories with shower facilities, they universally promoted the benefits of showering, reducing the possibility of spreading diseases when bathing in a single pool. In the garment factory, the workers' class friendship was promoted, and mutual aid groups for pregnant women were established, reducing miscarriages. Through the health stations, menstrual paper was disinfected and then sold to female workers, so that female workers paid attention to daily hygiene. In addition, many pregnant women went to the hospital in time for examinations, preventing prenatal accidents.
    The experience of various factories in Tianjin shows that factory nursery work and maternal and child health work are part of the factory's work and must occupy a certain position in the factory's overall work. Nursery work and health work should serve production, preventing simple welfare views or simple business views; and it is necessary to mobilize the masses, strengthen organization, and unite all forces in order to do these two aspects of work effectively. In fact, in factories that value nursery work and health work, not only are these two aspects of work successful, but they also play a certain role in improving production.

    天津市工厂保育工作者与妇幼卫生工作者
    保证母亲们完成了生产任务
    天津市工厂保育工作者及妇幼卫生工作人员，为了解除女工在生产竞赛运动中的具体困难，使她们能够与男工同样在生产战线上取得胜利，从今年四月开始展开了爱国主义的工作竞赛运动。
    工厂保育工作和妇幼卫生工作的主要任务是带好孩子，保证孩子的健康，使女工能完成或超额完成生产任务。这一任务大家是完成了。如在竞赛中，天津国营第一棉纺织厂有八十二个儿童出麻疹，托儿所一方面把出麻疹的孩子集中护理，由保育员日夜分工看护；另一方面动员了市内的医生给孩子们治疗，八十二个儿童终于全部恢复健康。三个星期中没有一个母亲请假。天津国营第三棉纺织厂，通过竞赛加强了分工负责制。保育员和母亲们组成竞赛小组，进行比赛：看那一组的保育员把孩子带的好，母亲在生产中得的红旗多。结果该厂一百三十四个母亲在竞赛中有四十三个母亲得了奖旗。今年全市选举模范时，该厂托儿所当选为模范托儿所。由于托儿所的工作紧密配合了生产运动，托儿所本身也有了很大的改进；因此，母亲们很高兴。很多母亲说：“现在孩子长得多胖！保育员不但关心我们的孩子，还关心到母亲的工作和学习。我们一定要好好的生产！”
    天津各工厂的保育工作之所以获得成绩，主要原因是：
    大家认识了工厂托儿所是工厂的一部分，保育工作竞赛也是工厂生产竞赛的一环；因此工厂行政、党支部、青年团对托儿所的领导必须加强，使竞赛工作做得更好。如天津国营第二、第三棉纺织厂的厂长、党支部书记、工会主席都曾亲自指导托儿所的工作。
    各托儿所订出了内容具体、明确的竞赛计划之后，妇联就配合工会有重点地派干部到工厂给予具体的帮助。在竞赛中，天津国营第三棉纺织厂首先团结了各方面的力量，加强了对保育员的思想教育，树立了专责制，并采取了细密分工的方法；同时在北京师范大学保育系同学来天津实习时，举办了托儿所所长、班长短期学习班，推广了新的保育经验和方法，介绍了新的保育制度，对各托儿所的竞赛工作起了推进的作用。为了保证各托儿所竞赛计划的执行，检查工作是必要的。在竞赛中，妇联、工会女工部曾组织各托儿所互相进行检查，并组织参观，检查后又召集各托儿所负责人举行座谈会，以改进今后的工作。
    妇联配合工会，团结医务工作者，在各厂开展了妇幼卫生工作。如举办卫生常识讲座，发动各小学及改造过的接生员到厂演出卫生剧，建立宿舍卫生值日制及工房卫生小组，又订立了奖励制，并为孕妇们设立了保健食堂。凡有淋浴设备的工厂，普遍进行宣传淋浴的好处，减少了在一个水池中洗澡时传染疾病的可能性。在被服厂发扬了工人的阶级友爱，建立了孕妇互助小组，减少了流产。并通过保健站将月经用纸经过消毒手续再卖给女工用，使女工都注意了日常的卫生，此外，很多孕妇及时地到医院里进行了检查，防止了产前的事故。
    天津各工厂的经验说明，工厂的保育工作与妇幼卫生工作乃是工厂工作的一部分，它必须在工厂总的工作中占有一定的地位。保育工作与卫生工作应为生产服务，防止单纯的福利观点或单纯的业务观点；并要发动群众，加强组织，团结各方面的力量，这样才能将这两方面的工作切实做好。事实上，凡是重视保育工作和卫生工作的工厂，不但这两方面的工作有成绩，同时对提高生产是起了一定的作用的。
