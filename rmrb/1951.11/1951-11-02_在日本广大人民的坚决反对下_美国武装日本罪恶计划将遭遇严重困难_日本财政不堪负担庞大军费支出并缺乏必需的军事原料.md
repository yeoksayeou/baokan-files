Xinhua News Agency, 30th. After the separate peace treaty with Japan was signed, the US government formulated a plan to accelerate the rearmament of Japan. However, due to the opposition of the Japanese people and the extreme weakness of the Japanese economy, even the Japanese reactionary government has no confidence in whether the American plan can be realized.

According to a report by the Dentsu News Agency from Washington on October 24, US Air Force Vice Chief of Staff Rawlings told the House Appropriations Committee that according to the US Department of Defense's "Japan Military Expansion Two-Year Plan," by the end of 1953, Japan will have an army of 300,000 men, a navy of 50,000 men, and an air force of 100,000 men. The plan stipulates that in the first year, Japan will establish an army with half of the projected number of personnel; in the following year, the army will be fully manned. Rawlings said that the US Department of Defense believes that the equipment and supplies for each Japanese soldier will cost one million yen per year (360 yen equals one US dollar). According to the Department of Defense's plan, in 1952, Japan will use 165.5 billion yen for military construction and 144.8 billion yen for expanding and re-equipping the "Police Reserve Force." The two combined amount to more than 310 billion yen, which is about 10 percent of Japan's total national income last year. In 1953, the first figure will increase to 224.9 billion yen, and the second figure will increase to 289.6 billion yen, totaling more than 510 billion yen.

However, the sinister American plan to rearm Japan will not only encounter the firm political opposition of the Japanese people, but also the huge military expenditures caused by this plan will be economically difficult for Japan to bear. According to the "Asahi Shimbun" on September 11, the expenses increased in Japan's fiscal expenditure for the next year due to the conclusion of the separate peace treaty (mainly for the so-called "self-defense expenses" for rearmament), even if it is calculated as little as one to two hundred billion yen, will deepen the Japanese economic crisis. The newspaper said: Japan's "fiscal trend after next year contains a serious inflationary crisis."

The lack of raw materials in Japan is also a serious difficulty for the United States to arm Japan. Japan is extremely short of steel raw materials alone, which are necessary for military construction. According to an AFP report from Tokyo on October 22, the Yoshida government stipulates that steel production in 1952 and 1953 should be 5 million tons per year. However, "how to obtain raw materials, funds, and electricity for the idle (steelmaking) equipment is still a difficult problem. If Japan wants to produce 5 million tons of steel, it will need 250 million US dollars to import 5.76 million tons of iron ore and 3.5 million tons of coking coal." AFP said, but Japan can no longer obtain these raw materials from China as before, "it can only rely mostly on the United States and on the development of mines in Southeast Asia, such as Portuguese Goa, Malaya, and the Philippines. But developing Southeast Asia requires a huge sum of money, and Japan's impoverished economy may not be able to bear this huge sum." AFP concluded: "Therefore, wanting Japan to produce 5 million tons of steel is by no means an easy task."

Faced with numerous difficulties, even Yoshida himself had to admit in his policy address to the Diet on October 12: "Japan now lacks the basic resources necessary for modern military equipment. The tax increase for rearmament is not something the (Japanese) people can bear."

### 在日本广大人民的坚决反对下  美国武装日本罪恶计划将遭遇严重困难  日本财政不堪负担庞大军费支出并缺乏必需的军事原料

　　在日本广大人民的坚决反对下
　  美国武装日本罪恶计划将遭遇严重困难
　  日本财政不堪负担庞大军费支出并缺乏必需的军事原料
    【新华社三十日讯】在单独对日和约签订之后，美国政府制订出加紧重新武装日本的计划。但是，由于日本人民的反对和日本经济的极度衰弱，美国的计划能否实现，连日本反动政府也没有信心。
    据电通社华盛顿十月二十四日电揭露，美国空军副参谋长罗林斯告众院拨款委员会说，根据美国国防部制订的“日本扩军两年计划”，到一九五三年年底，日本将有一支三十万人的陆军、一支五万人的海军和一支十万人的空军。该计划规定，在第一年中日本将建立一支为预计人数一半的军队；在下一年，军队将可满员。罗林斯说，美国国防部认为，日本军队中每人一年的装备和给养费需要一百万日本（三百六十日元合一美元）。根据国防部的计划，在一九五二年，日本将以一千六百五十五亿日元用于建军，一千四百四十八亿日元用于扩充并重新装备“警察后备队”。两者合计达三千一百多亿日元，约为去年度日本全部国民收入的百分之十。在一九五三年，第一个数字将增加到二千二百四十九亿日元，第二个数字将增加到二千八百九十六亿日元，总计达五千一百多亿日元。
    但是，美国重新武装日本的罪恶计划，不但将在政治上遭到日本人民的坚决反对，而且这个计划所引起的庞大军费支出，在经济上也将是日本所难于负担的。据九月十一日的《朝日新闻》表示，日本明年度的财政开支中，因单独和约的缔结而增加的费用（以用于重新武装的所谓“自卫费”为主），即使以少到一千数百亿日元计算，就要加深日本经济的危机。该报说：日本“明年度以后的财政趋势，含有严重的通货膨胀危机。”
    日本原料缺乏也是美国武装日本的严重困难问题。仅建军所必需的钢铁原料一项，日本就极端缺乏。据法新社东京十月二十二日讯，吉田政府规定，一九五二年和一九五三年的钢的生产，每年应为五百万吨。但是，“如何为空闲下来的（制钢）装备获得原料、资金和电力却仍然是一个困难的问题。如果日本要生产五百万吨钢，就需要二亿五千万美元来输入五百七十六万吨铁矿砂和三百五十万吨焦煤。”法新社说，但是，日本已经不能够再像从前那样从中国取得这些原料，“它只有大部分仰赖美国，并仰赖东南亚各地如葡属果阿、马来亚和菲律宾等地矿山的开发。但是开发东南亚需要一笔庞大的款项，恐怕日本的贫瘠的经济不可能负担这笔巨款”。法新社的结论是：“因此，想要日本生产五百万吨钢远不是一件轻而易举的事。”
    面对着重重的困难，甚至吉田本人十月十二日在国会发表施政演说时，也不得不承认：“日本现在缺乏近代军备所必要的基本资源。为了重整军备的增税，不是（日本）国民所能承担的。”
