　　Handan Railway Station Improves Cotton Loading Method
　　Saving Ten Railcars in Five Days
　　Editor: Workers at Handan Railway Station, including Zhang You Tian, recently improved the cotton loading method, enabling each railcar to load a maximum of 147 bales of cotton and at least 120 bales. Previously, a railcar could generally only load 110 to 118 bales of cotton. Since implementing the new loading method, our company's cotton, in just five days from October 18th to 22nd, has loaded 1,016 bales more than before, saving the nation ten railcars and transportation costs of 59.16 million yuan. This method at Handan Railway Station provides a strong guarantee for completing the task of transporting cotton out of the Handan area. We believe this achievement is the result of the close cooperation between our company and Handan Railway Station. Therefore, we hope that cotton yarn and fabric companies in various regions can cooperate closely with transportation units to improve cotton transportation work.
                            Handan Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company
    Editor's Note: Please ask the Handan City Federation of Trade Unions to introduce the loading method of Comrade Zhang You Tian and others.

### 邯郸车站改进棉花装车方法  五天节省十个车皮

　　邯郸车站改进棉花装车方法
    五天节省十个车皮
    编辑同志：邯郸车站工人张有田等最近改进了棉花装车方法，使一个车皮，最多能装一百四十七包棉花，至少亦能装一百二十包。过去，一个车皮一般只能装一百一十包至一百一十八包棉花。自实行新的装车方法后，我公司棉花只在十月十八日至二十二日的五天当中，已较前多装一千零十六包，为国家节省了十个车皮和运费五千九百一十六万元。邯郸车站这一个方法，给邯郸地区完成棉花外运的任务提供了有力的保证。我们认为，这一点成就是我公司与邯郸车站经常保持密切配合的结果。因此，我们希望各地花纱布公司能与运输单位密切地配合起来，把棉花运输工作提高一步。
                            邯郸花纱布公司
    编者按：请邯郸市工会负责将张有田同志等的装车方法加以介绍。
