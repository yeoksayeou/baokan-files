Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 14th: Many Indian newspapers have published editorials welcoming the visit of the Chinese cultural delegation to India. These newspapers unanimously believe that the unity and friendship between the people of India and China is not only beneficial to mutual cooperation and progress but also beneficial to the cause of maintaining world peace. Columnists from various newspapers across India have referred to the period of the Chinese cultural delegation's stay in New Delhi as "China Week" in the Indian capital. Many newspapers have published detailed reports about the delegation, photos of the delegation and its members, and published letters from readers inquiring about the delegation.

　　The "Liberty" published in Calcutta on October 29th published an article welcoming the delegation, saying: The cultural delegation from India's great neighbor, China, will be infinitely loved by the Indian people. The newspaper traced the history of the long-term friendship between the Chinese and Indian people and wished "Long Live Sino-Indian Friendship."

　　The "World Friend News" published in New Delhi wrote on November 5th: "The Chinese government has extended a hand of friendship to us by sending a cultural delegation, which has strengthened the traditional friendship between our two countries that has existed since ancient times."

　　The "Hindustan Times" published in New Delhi wrote on November 1st: "The visit of the Chinese cultural delegation to India and the public welcome they received in New Delhi demonstrate respect for the outstanding representatives themselves, and also demonstrate India's emphasis on the new China." The newspaper described the various problems encountered by the Chinese People's Government and its achievements. The newspaper said: "China's example is very sufficient to promote progress, and the cultural delegation informing India about how China has progressed in various aspects will definitely make significant contributions to consolidating existing friendly ties."

　　The "Inspiration Daily" published in Kanpur, United Provinces, published an editorial on November 2nd saying that the visit of the Chinese cultural delegation to India will further consolidate the cultural and fraternal relations between the people of the two countries. The newspaper pointed out: "Imperialists are likely to want to restore their power on the Asian continent by relying on their barbaric military force. Therefore, Asian countries should be vigilant and should consolidate their cultural and other relations with each other."

　　The "Leader News" in Allahabad emphasized on November 3rd the contribution of the Chinese and Indian people to peace.

　　The "Amrita Bazar Patrika" published in Calcutta wrote on November 3rd: "The warm reception the Chinese cultural delegation received in India fully proves India's desire, and the Chinese people's sincere welcome to the Indian Goodwill Mission also expresses the same desire on their side. We hope that this renewed bond of unity between the people of the two countries will become increasingly consolidated due to more cultural contacts."

　　In addition, the "Assam Tribune," the New Delhi "Vitality News," and the "Hindustan Flag News," which are published simultaneously in Calcutta and New Delhi, have all published editorials or articles welcoming the Chinese cultural delegation.

　　印度许多报纸发表社论热烈欢迎我文化代表团
    【新华社新德里十四日电】印度许多报纸都发表社论，欢迎中国文化代表团访问印度。这些报纸一致认为：印、中两国人民的团结和友谊不仅有益于彼此的合作和进步，而且有益于维护世界和平的事业。印度全国各报的专栏作家，都把中国文化代表团在新德里勾留的期间，称为印度首都的“中国周”。很多报纸都刊载了关于代表团的详细报道、代表团的和团员的照片，并发表了读者询问代表团的来信。
    加尔各答出版的“自由报”十月二十九日著文欢迎代表团说：从印度的伟大邻邦中国来的文化代表团，将受到印度人民的无限爱戴。该报追述了中、印两国人民之间的长期友谊关系的历史，并祝“中印友谊万岁”。
    新德里出版的“世界之友报”在十一月五日写道：“中国政府向我们伸出友谊之手，派遣文化代表团前来，已经加强了从古代以来即已存在的我们两国之间的传统友谊。”
