Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 15th dispatch: Strike movements are vigorously unfolding in various parts of Italy, indicating that the struggle to defend the right to life, launched on a national scale by Italian workers in response to the call of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, has begun.

Recently, tens of thousands of Italian workers have gone on strike, demanding wage increases and opposing mass layoffs. At the "Breda" machine factory in Sesto San Giovanni, near Milan, the industrial center of northern Italy, all 11,000 workers, led by the trade union, went on strike starting from the 3rd, protesting against the government and the factory management for implementing the American policy of destroying Italy's heavy industry, which resulted in the layoff of 3,000 workers in this factory. Workers from other factories in Sesto San Giovanni have stopped work for rallies and demonstrations to show their support.

The 15,000 employees of the "Pirelli" Trust's rubber factory in Milan went on strike for 24 hours on the 9th to fight for wage increases and improved working conditions. The 40,000 employees of the various factories of the Turin "Fiat" Concern, Italy's largest monopoly enterprise, went on strike for three hours on October 22 to protest against the factory management's large-scale wage cuts by shortening the work week; on November 8, the workers of the "Fiat" automobile factory stopped work again and held protest meetings in the workshops.

The 10,000 miners in the Carbonia coal area of Sardinia and the 10,000 miners in the sulfur mines of Sicily have also gone on strike successively, demanding wage increases and improved working conditions.

This series of strikes is a prelude to larger-scale strikes in Italy. In Italy, as a result of the Gasperi government's pursuit of the American war policy, the cost of living has risen by 13 percent from January last year to September this year, and the income of three-quarters of the families in the country is insufficient to maintain the minimum living standard. After Gasperi's visit to the United States in September this year, he assumed an even heavier burden of war preparation, and the situation of the working people will undoubtedly deteriorate further. Therefore, the Italian General Confederation of Labor, in accordance with the urgent demands of all working people, decided on October 18 to launch a nationwide struggle to demand a general wage increase of 15 percent. Under the call of the General Confederation of Labor, workers in various factories are prepared to go on strike at any time. The Soviet "Labor News" commented on this matter, pointing out: The Italian labor movement is flourishing. There is no doubt that the Italian working people will be able to safeguard their legitimate demands in the arduous class struggle.

### 响应总工会要求增加工资的号召  意罢工运动蓬勃展开

　　响应总工会要求增加工资的号召
    意罢工运动蓬勃展开
    【新华社十五日讯】罗马消息：意大利各地的罢工运动正在蓬勃地展开，这表明意大利工人响应意大利总工会的号召而在全国范围内发动的保卫生活权利的斗争已经开始。
    最近以来，已有数万意大利工人举行了罢工，要求增加工资，并反对大批解雇。意大利北部工业中心米兰附近塞斯托·圣佐凡尼的“布雷达”机器厂全体一万一千工人在工会领导下从三日起开始罢工，抗议政府和厂方因执行美国摧毁意大利重工业的政策而解雇这个工厂的三千名工人。塞斯托·圣佐凡尼其他各工厂的工人都曾停工集会，并举行示威游行，表示声援。
    米兰“皮列利”托拉斯所属橡胶工厂的一万五千个职工，为争取增加工资和改善劳动条件，在九日罢工二十四小时。意大利最大的垄断企业都灵“菲亚特”康采恩各工厂的四万职工，为抗议厂方用缩短工作周的方法大量削减工资，曾在十月二十二日罢工三小时；十一月八日，“菲亚特”汽车工厂的工人又停了工，在车间内举行抗议大会。
    撒丁岛卡波尼亚煤区的一万矿工与西西里岛各硫磺矿的一万矿工也先后罢工，要求增加工资和改善劳动条件。
    这一系列的罢工是意大利更大规模的罢工的先声。在意大利，由于加斯贝利政府奉行美国的战争政策的结果，生活费用从去年一月到今年九月就上涨了百分之十三，全国有四分之三的家庭收入不足维持最低生活水平。加斯贝利今年九月访问美国后又承担了更沉重的备战负担，劳动人民的处境无疑会更加恶化。因此，意大利总工会已根据全体劳动人民的迫切要求，在十月十八日决定在全国范围内发动要求普遍提高工资百分之十五的斗争。在总工会的号召下，各工厂的工人已准备随时举行罢工。苏联“劳动报”在评论这件事时指出：意大利劳工运动正在蓬勃高涨。毫无疑问，意大利劳动人民是能够在艰苦的阶级斗争中维护他们的正当要求的。
