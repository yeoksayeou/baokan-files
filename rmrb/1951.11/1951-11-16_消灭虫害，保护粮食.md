　　Eliminate Pests, Protect Grain
    Eliminating insect pests in stored grain is an urgent and constant task. The insect infestation in the grain stored by branches of the China Grain Company is quite serious. For example, the Linhuaiguan, Huainan, and Suxian sub-companies affiliated with the Anhui North Grain Company have five to six million jin of sorghum in storage, with losses of 20% due to insect infestation. According to incomplete statistics from the China Grain Company, approximately 730 million jin of grain were infested with insects in various locations in July, resulting in a loss of 36.5 million jin, equivalent to 36.5 billion yuan in Renminbi.

    Individual leading cadres and storage personnel of some grain companies have not yet paid attention to the serious insect infestations. They are ideologically paralyzed, watching the state property suffer losses, which is not permissible. When insect infestation occurred in the grain stored in the Wenzhou branch of the Zhejiang Grain Company, the leading cadres said: "Small insects cannot eat much grain, and it is impossible for tens of thousands of jin to be eaten." When the wheat stored by the Nanjing Grain Company was infested with insects, the processing personnel said: "Insects appear every year. If we spray powder and turn the piles, I am afraid that the cost will be higher than the grain eaten by the insects." The grain stored by the Longchang branch of the Sichuan South Grain Company was generally infested with insects, and the storage personnel actually believed: "Grain infestation is a natural occurrence." Therefore, they allowed it to develop without prevention and control.

    Every responsible grain worker should actively fight against pests with all their strength. For the insect pests that have been discovered, immediate measures should be taken to eliminate them and prevent them from spreading. For empty warehouses in various places, disinfection should be carried out as much as possible to eliminate residual insects and eggs. At the same time, attention should be paid to maintaining a clean environment and isolating the breeding medium. In short, as long as everyone pays attention to this issue, difficulties can be overcome, and insect pests can be eliminated or reduced.

　　消灭虫害，保护粮食
    消灭仓库存粮的虫害，是一个紧急而经常的任务。中国粮食公司所属分支公司仓库存粮中，虫害相当严重。例如皖北粮食公司所属临淮关、淮南、宿县等支公司，存有红粮五、六百万斤，因受虫害，损失百分之二十。据中国粮食公司不完整的统计，七月份各地生虫粮食约七亿三千万斤，损失达三千六百五十万斤，折合人民币三百六十五亿元。
    个别粮食公司的领导干部和保管人员，对于严重的虫害，至今尚未注意起来。他们思想麻痹，坐视国家财产遭受损失，这是不能允许的。浙江省粮食公司温州分公司的仓库存粮发生虫害，领导干部说：“小小虫子吃不了多少谷子，不会有几十万斤被吃光的。”南京市粮食公司所存小麦生虫，加工人员说：“虫子是年年生，如果喷粉、翻堆，恐怕比虫吃的代价还要大。”川南粮食公司隆昌支公司所存粮食普遍生虫，保管人员竟认为：“粮食生虫是自然的事。”因而任其发展，不加防治。
    每一个有责任心的粮食工作人员，都应该积极起来，全力和害虫作斗争。对已发现的虫害，应立即设法除治，不使蔓延；对各地空仓，要尽可能进行消毒，扑灭遗虫遗卵；同时，应注意保持环境清洁，隔绝生虫媒介。总之，只要大家都注意这个问题，困难是可以克服，虫害是可以消灭或减少的。
