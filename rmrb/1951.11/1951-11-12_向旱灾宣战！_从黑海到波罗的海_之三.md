　　Declaring War on Drought!
    "From the Black Sea to the Baltic Sea" Part 3
    Xinhua News Agency Correspondent in Prague, Wu Wentao
    In Bulgaria, a great battle is being waged. That is: the battle against drought. Although Bulgaria is close to the Black Sea and the Aegean Sea, the Balkan and Rhodope Mountains run across the central and southwestern parts of the country, so the climate is generally continental, and rainfall is often uneven. Many streams rush out of the Balkan Mountains and pour into the Danube River, which borders Romania to the north. One might think that the crops there would not suffer from drought, right? But that is not the case. In the spring, when the snow melts, the Danube River overflows its banks and floods villages; when the water recedes, hot winds blow up yellow sand, and even the grass withers from the drought.
    "Relying on the heavens for food" - this was the helpless situation of Bulgarian farmers before liberation. After liberation, the Bulgarian government immediately regarded the irrigation problem as an important task, determined to conquer nature with manpower and science and technology.
    The Five-Year Plan, which began in 1949, stipulated that by 1953, 3.37 million decares (approximately 1.1 acres) of land throughout Bulgaria would be irrigated with electric pumping; in the bourgeois era, the total area of land irrigated by farmers themselves using primitive methods was only 50,000 decares.
    After visiting the "Kagyarovo" Village Agricultural Cooperative, I went to visit the newly completed Maritsa River Pumping Station, which is located seven or eight kilometers away from Kagyarovo Village.
    From the outside, the pumping station is just a small house by the river. Inside, there are three brand-new electric water pumps, which can be easily operated by one worker. Each pumping turbine pumps water from the Maritsa River at a rate of 33,000 liters per minute to a ground level more than ten feet high, and converges into a large water reservoir built of cement. Then, a main canal, seven or eight feet wide and five or six feet deep, leads the water from this reservoir to the farms. About half a kilometer away from the pumping station, the main canal is divided into three branches. At the branches, there are cement gates; when a canal is not in use, it is closed. I stood on a carriage and looked around. The flowing ditches passed straight through the flat fertile fields; in the dry heat of the Balkan May, there was a refreshing breeze from time to time, with the fishy smell of aquatic plants.
    Engineer Antonov, who accompanied us on the tour, said: A total of 68 kilometers of channels have been completed. When all the canals are completed, they can irrigate 48,000 decares of land. Antonov also said: In the past, the construction of such projects was extremely difficult. First of all, it is difficult to systematically design and build a canal in the small plots of land in the complex individual economy. But today, under the conditions that large areas of land are collectively operated by cooperatives, it not only facilitates the design, but also the organized labor of the cooperative members greatly accelerates the digging of canals. Last winter, the Kagyarovo Village Cooperative organized its members to dig canals on the fields belonging to the cooperative, totaling more than 10,000 "labor days." Because the canal projects are all funded by the government, they receive wages from the government, and the cooperative will pay rent to the government when it uses water in the future.
    The operation of the pumping station water pumps requires electricity. During the fifty years of bourgeois rule in Bulgaria, only 784 villages had access to electricity, while the People's Government has provided electricity to 2,300 villages in the seven years since the war. Some places, such as the Danube River lowlands, will not have enough electricity to power the water pumps until 1952, according to the Five-Year Plan. However, since last year (1950), hundreds of kilometers of canals along the Danube River from Nikopol to Svetov City have been irrigating tens of thousands of decares of land.
    This is indeed a miracle. Antonov and his assistants unanimously said: This miracle is mainly due to Comrade Stalin. Under the guidance of Comrade Stalin, Soviet technicians came here in early 1949 to study how to quickly irrigate the vast Danube River lowlands without a power source. During the construction of the canals, the Soviet Union not only supplied pumping equipment, but also sent temporary mobile power plants - power trains - to supply electricity. Tens of thousands of Bulgarian farmers participated in this project with all the tools and transportation they had. On December 21, 1949, when the working people of the world celebrated Comrade Stalin's 70th birthday, the entire project was completed. The farmers were grateful to Comrade Stalin. They wrote to Comrade Stalin, telling him how enthusiastically they participated in the construction of the canals, saying, "This is the best gift we can give you!"
    I asked Antonov about the government's investment in pumping stations and canal networks. He said: The Maritsa River canals have not been fully completed, so it is not yet clear; but he cited the example of the completed project on the Danube River: There, the government's investment in irrigating each decare of land is about 6,600 leva (equivalent to 13 US dollars), and the increased yield of crops per decare of land in the area each year exceeds this amount. After the planned irrigation of more than 3 million decares of land in the future, the increase in national income will be imaginable. Because I still wanted to visit the Dimitrov Water Gate, which is being built near Kazanlak City, more than 100 kilometers to the north, my conversation with Antonov ended here.
    The Dimitrov Water Gate is built on the Tundzha River near Kazanlak City. Engineer Dimov, who participated in the national armed uprising led by the Bulgarian Communist Party in 1923, later went to the Soviet Union to study engineering, and had been to Northeast China, took us to the construction site and introduced the situation of the project in detail.
    The torrential Tundzha River, like a snake, meanders through the hills at the southern foot of the Balkan Mountains, and there is no irrigation to speak of. However, more than 20 kilometers outside Kazanlak, across the mountain, there is the Stara Zagora Valley, the most fertile soil in the country; only ten kilometers away, there is a small valley known to the world for its roses. In the past, farmers in these two regions also relied on the heavens for food. Two years ago, the government decided to make the useless Tundzha River serve the people of these two regions. First of all, a dam 800 meters long and 40 meters high and wide was built between the mountains facing each other on both banks, cutting off the river in the middle to form a huge reservoir. The water first passes through a cement gate in the center, drives a generator to generate electricity; then it is divided into two streams, the first stream is the main stream, flowing along the mountainside through a 26-kilometer-long artificial riverbed to a small mountain that blocks the way. People then cut a tunnel several kilometers long in this mountain to let the water out. On the other side of the mountain, the Stara Zagora Valley is 150 meters lower than this side, so the water artificially forms a waterfall, generates electricity again, and then goes through the ditches to irrigate the land. The second stream of water is introduced into the artificial riverbed to irrigate the "Rose Valley." In this way, the Tundzha River is used to generate electricity twice and irrigate 350,000 decares of land. In addition to supplying the necessary pumping equipment, the electricity generated by these two hydroelectric power stations can also greatly subsidize the industrial electricity consumption of nearby cities.
    Engineer Dimov told me that the entire project will take five years to complete. Needless to say, the difficulties in construction can be imagined. But Dimov showed perseverance and confidence in every sentence. He said, "With the leadership of the Communist Party and the superior technology of the Soviet Union, we can conquer everything. We can go to socialism!" He seemed to be very clear about the unlimited capacity of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and other large rivers in our country. He said that he was eager to come to our country to serve after the water conservancy project in Bulgaria came to an end. But first of all, he asked me to visit Kazanlak again in 1954, because at that time, the battle against drought would be victoriously concluded.

### 向旱灾宣战！  “从黑海到波罗的海”之三

　　向旱灾宣战！
    “从黑海到波罗的海”之三
    新华社驻布拉格记者　吴文焘
    在保加利亚，一个伟大的战斗正在进行着。这就是：和旱灾的战斗。虽然保加利亚靠近黑海和爱琴海，可是由于巴尔干山脉和罗多彼山脉横列在中部和西南部，气候一般带有大陆性，雨水常常是不调的。多少条从巴尔干山脉冲出来的溪流灌注到北面和罗马尼亚分界的多瑙河，人们会想：那里的庄稼，总该不致受旱吧？可是事实不然。春天，当雪融化了的时候，多瑙河的河水会夺岸而出，淹没村庄；当水退了，热风吹起黄沙，草都要旱得枯黄。
    “靠天吃饭”——这是解放前保加利亚农民无可奈何的景况。解放后，保加利亚政府立刻把灌溉问题当作一桩重要的工作，决心用人力和科学技术来征服自然。
    一九四九年开始的五年计划规定：到一九五三年，全保加利亚将有三百三十七万狄卡尔（每狄卡尔约合一市亩强）土地得到电力汲水灌溉；而在资产阶级时代，农民自己结合起来用原始方法灌溉的土地面积，一共不过五万狄卡尔。
    我在参观了“卡加洛沃”村农业合作社后，便到离卡加洛沃村七、八公里外刚刚完成的马里乍河抽水站去观光。
    从外面看，抽水站不过是河边的一所小平房。里面，是三部崭新的电动抽水机，一个工人就可以操纵裕如。每个抽水涡轮，以一分钟抽水三万三千立升的速度，把马里乍河河水抽到一丈多高的地平面上来，汇到一个水泥筑成的大水库。接着，一条七八尺宽、五六尺深的主渠，就把水从这个水库导向田庄去。在离抽水站约半公里的地方，主渠分成三支，分支的地方，都有水泥作的闸口，那一条渠不用水时，就把它关起来。我站在一个马车上瞭望，流水盈盈的沟渠，笔直地穿过坦平的沃野；五月巴尔干的燥热里，不时透出爽人的、带着水草腥味的清风。
    陪我们参观的安托诺夫工程师说：现在已完成的渠道共有六十八公里。水渠全部修成时，可以灌溉四万八千狄卡尔的土地。安托诺夫又说：在过去，这类工程的兴建是极端困难的。首先，错综复杂的个体经济的小块土地，很难有系统地设计和修筑一条水渠。但在今天大块土地由合作社集体经营的条件下，不但便利了设计，而且合作社员们的有组织的帮工，更大大地加速了水渠的开掘。卡加洛沃村的合作社，就在去冬组织了社员们在属于该社的田地上挖渠，共计工作了一万多个“劳动日”。因为水渠工程都是政府出资兴办的，他们向政府领工资，将来合作社用水时，再向政府缴租钱。
    抽水站抽水机的转动需要电力。在资产阶级统治保加利亚的五十年中，只有七百八十四个村庄可以使用到电力，而人民政府在战后七年中，就已使二千三百个村庄得到电力供应。有些地方，例如多瑙河低地，按照五年计划也得到一九五二年才有足够的推动抽水机的电力。可是，从去年（一九五○年）起，多瑙河沿岸从尼科波尔到斯维托夫城间长达数百公里的渠道，已在灌溉着成万狄卡尔的土地了。
    这的确是奇迹。安托诺夫和他的助理员们一致说：这个奇迹主要归功于斯大林同志。在斯大林同志的指示下，从一九四九年初，苏联的技师就到这里来，研究如何在没有电源的情况下，迅速使广大的多瑙河低地得到灌溉。在兴建水渠的过程中，苏联不仅供给了抽水设备，还送来了临时的活动发电厂——发电列车，供给电流。成千成万的保加利亚农民，利用他们所有的一切工具和运输力，参加了这个工程。一九四九年十二月二十一日，当全世界劳动人民庆祝斯大林同志七十寿辰时，全部工程已告完成。农民们感念斯大林同志，他们把自己怎样热烈地参加修渠的情况，写信告诉斯大林同志说：“这就是我们报答你的最好的礼物！”
    我问安托诺夫关于政府对抽水站和水渠网的投资情况。他说：马里乍河的渠道还没有全部完成，所以还不清楚；但他举了多瑙河已完成的工程的例子：在那里，政府对灌溉每一狄卡尔土地的投资，约为六千六百利瓦（合十三美元），而该区每年每一狄卡尔土地的农作物的增产量，其价值就超过了这个数目。在今后计划中的三百余万狄卡尔土地全部实行灌溉后，它对国家收入的增加，就可想而知了。因为我还要观光正北一百多公里以外的卡桑勒克城附近正在兴修的季米特洛夫水闸，我和安托诺夫的谈话，就此结束。
    季米特洛夫水闸，是筑在卡桑勒克城附近的通济河上。一个参加过一九二三年保共所领导的全国武装起义，后来转赴苏联学习工程，并到过我国东北的工程师邸莫夫，把我们带到施工的地方去，详细地介绍了这个工程的情况。
    水流湍急的通济河，像一条蛇样地穿行在巴尔干山脉南麓的丘陵地带，本来谈不上什么灌溉的。但是，在卡桑勒克以外二十多公里处，隔着山有一个全国土质最富饶的斯塔拉·萨哥拉谷地；只在十余公里外，还有一个以玫瑰花闻名世界的小谷地。从前这两个地区的农民也是靠天吃饭的。前年，政府决定使无用的通济河为这两个地区的人民服务，首先，就在两岸遥遥相对的山头之间修筑一条长八百米、高宽各四十米的大坝，将河拦腰斩断，形成一个巨大的水库。水先从正中一个水泥制的水门通过，推动发电机发了电；然后就被导为两股，第一股是主流，沿山坡经二十六公里长的人造河床，流到迎头挡住的一座小山，人们再把这座山凿开一条几公里长的隧道，让水渲泻出去。在山那边的斯塔拉·萨哥拉谷地，比这边要低一百五十米，因之，水就人为地形成一个瀑布，再生产一次电力，才经过沟渠去浇地。第二股水被导入人造河床去灌溉“玫瑰谷”。这样通济河就被利用来发电两次，和灌溉三十五万狄卡尔的土地。这两个水力发电站所生产的电力，除了供给必要的抽水设备外，还能大量补助附近城市的工业用电。
    邸莫夫工程师告诉我：全部工程需要五年才能完工。用不着说，在施工上的困难，是可以想像的。但邸莫夫每句话都表现着毅力和信心，他说：“有着共产党的领导，有着苏联的超等技术，我们就可以征服一切。我们就可以走到社会主义去！”他似乎很清楚我国长江、黄河等大川所蕴藏的无限能力。他说他亟愿在保加利亚的水利工程告一段落后到我国来服务。但他首先要求我在一九五四年再到卡桑勒克去参观，因为，那时一场和旱灾的战斗就胜利结束了。
