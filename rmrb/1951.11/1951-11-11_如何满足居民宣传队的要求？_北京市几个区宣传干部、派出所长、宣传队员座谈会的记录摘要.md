Editor's Note:  What is published here is a summary of a symposium jointly convened by the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and this publication.  Like many other cities, the work of Beijing's resident propaganda teams has been fruitful, but there are still some shortcomings that need to be quickly overcome. This article summarizes some of the problems existing in the work of the resident propaganda teams, which are of reference value to cities across the country.

　　Seventh District Propaganda Team Member Wang Lihua (female): Based on the situation in our street, no matter what we do, as long as the masses understand it, things will naturally be easy to handle. In our street, the Cultural Center has set up a cultural station, providing us with books and newspapers and regularly leading everyone in learning. The awareness of the masses has been raised, and the work of donation and promotion of the Patriotic Public Pledge has been done very well, and the work of preferential treatment has also been very successful. Some military family members are sick, and everyone automatically raises money to help them with treatment. For poor military family members, landlords reduce their rent. For lonely, widowed, and elderly military family members, everyone carries water for them, sweeps their yards, and often asks them about their well-being. If the masses did not truly understand loving the people's army and loving military family members, it would be difficult to achieve this.

　　Fourth District Party Committee Propaganda Minister Jin Jian: We have more than 980 resident propaganda team members in our district. Their propaganda activities have penetrated into every household and played a significant role in various tasks. Now the propaganda team members urgently need learning and regular assistance. The Party's propaganda workers in district-level agencies are too busy to go down to the grassroots. It was originally stipulated that they should give reports to the mass propaganda team members once every half month, but sometimes it is difficult to do so. The regular leadership and assistance to the propaganda teams is best done by the comrades of the Public Security Bureau police stations, because they often have direct work contacts with the backbone members of the propaganda teams. But now some public security cadres in our district are unwilling to do this work, and they feel that this is not their own business.

　　Eighth District Party Committee Propaganda Minister Gao Sen: As far as I know, it is still possible for the Party's propaganda workers in the agencies to take two hours each week to go to the propaganda team once. Why can't they go down? The large number of crash tasks and the relative busyness of the cadres are one reason; but the main reason is the issue of ideological understanding. First of all, the leading cadres do not pay attention to it, and they do not mobilize and urge the propaganda workers in the agencies to go down regularly. Some even feel that this is a burden on the agency cadres, which is not right.

　　Eighth District Propaganda Team Member Zhang Wenyong: We have more than 500 propaganda team members in our district, and everyone has a high enthusiasm for learning. We have three ways of learning: (1) hold a district-wide propaganda team member meeting once a month, where comrades from the district give reports; (2) participate in the study class organized by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, once a week; (3) recently, the district's Support-Korea-Resist-America branch has also organized a short-term study class, specializing in the Patriotic Public Pledge. Our participation in learning is voluntary. Forty-six of our team's seventy-five members participate in learning. After listening to the lectures, we also organize discussions. Some people who do not attend the lectures are also willing to participate in the discussions. The district is very concerned about our propaganda team and often helps and encourages us in our work.

　　Seventh District Party Committee Propaganda Department Staff Member Xu Kang: Our District Party Committee Propaganda Department did not pay attention to the activities of the agency propaganda workers in the past, nor did it effectively obtain the help of the comrades from the police station for the propaganda teams. When carrying out mass propaganda work, it was very enthusiastic in April and May of this year, and many district-level agency cadres went down to help with the work, but after the propaganda enthusiasm passed, everyone returned to their original work posts, and they also broke contact with the masses. At that time, two or three cadres were left to give large lectures specifically to the mass propaganda team members. However, the comrades who lectured knew very little about how the propaganda team members would conduct propaganda after learning, or what problems existed within the propaganda teams, and therefore they could not be resolved in a timely manner. Due to the lack of leadership of the propaganda teams, the enthusiasm of most of the members is getting lower and lower, and the number of people listening to large lectures is also decreasing day by day.

　　Second District Party Committee Propaganda Department Staff Member Li Tianshou: In April of this year, some street residents in our district spontaneously established some propaganda teams, but the district did not provide assistance or leadership, and most of them were left to fend for themselves. Only in the area managed by the Ninth Police Station, because of the enthusiastic help of the police chief, the propaganda team and other mass propaganda organizations are becoming more and more consolidated and expanded, and they have created a method of holding "Resist America and Aid Korea Day" once a week, which has played a great role in educating the masses in patriotism. The District Committee made a resolution in August to strengthen the leadership of the propaganda team in that section and send a cadre to go down to help regularly, but to this day, the resolution has not been implemented.

　　Fourth District Public Security Bureau Twenty-First Police Station Chief Xie Fang: After these months of mass Resist-America-Aid-Korea propaganda activities, the residents' political consciousness has been greatly improved. The masses have shown great enthusiasm for reporting and supervising bad people, fire prevention, and theft prevention. Rumors have been largely extinguished, and the relationship between the police station and the masses has become closer. This has created favorable conditions for public security work. I believe that the police station can and must do mass propaganda work.

    如何满足居民宣传队的要求？
    ——北京市几个区宣传干部、派出所长、宣传队员座谈会的记录摘要
    编者按：这里发表的是中共北京市委宣传部和本刊共同召集的座谈会的记录摘要。和其他许多城市一样，北京市居民宣传队的工作是有成绩的，但还有着一些缺点，需要迅速加以克服。这里摘要发表关于居民宣传队工作中存在的一些问题，对于全国各城市都有参考价值。
    七区宣传队员王立华（女）：根据我们街上的情形，不论办什么事，只要让群众懂得了，自然就好办。我们街上，有文化馆在那里设立了一个文化站，供给我们书报，经常领导大家学习。群众的觉悟提高了，对捐献、推行爱国公约的工作都作得很好，优抚工作也有很大成绩。有的军属病了，大家自动凑钱帮助他治病。对贫苦的军属，房东减低他们的房租。对孤寡年老的军属，大家给他担水、扫院子，经常去问寒问暖。如果不是群众真正懂得了爱人民的军队、爱军属，要作到这样是难的。
    四区区委宣传部长金健：我们区共有居民宣传队员九百八十多人。他们的宣传活动深入到各家各户，对各项工作起了很大作用。现在宣传队员迫切要求学习和经常的帮助。区级机关内党的宣传员因为工作忙，下不去，原来规定每半个月给群众宣传队员作一次报告，有时就难以作到。对宣传队的经常领导和帮助，最好由公安局派出所的同志作，因为他们经常直接和宣传队中的骨干分子发生工作上的联系。但是现在我们区还有一部分公安干部不大愿作这个工作，他们感到这不是自己的本身业务。
    八区区委宣传部长高森：据我了解，机关内党的宣传员每人每星期抽出两点钟的时间，到宣传队去一次，还是可以作到的。为什么下不去呢？突击工作多，干部比较忙，这是一方面的原因；但主要的还是思想认识问题。首先是领导干部不重视，不动员和督促机关宣传员经常下去，有的反觉得这事背在机关干部身上是个麻烦，这是不对的。
    八区宣传队员张文永：我们区宣传队员共有五百多人，大家的学习情绪很高。我们学习的方式有三种：（一）每月开一次全区宣传员大会，由区上的同志给作报告；（二）参加中苏友好协会办的学习班，每周一次；（三）最近区抗美援朝支会又办了短期学习班，专门讲爱国公约问题。我们参加学习都是自愿的，我们队七十五个人有四十六个参加学习。我们听了课回来还要组织讨论，有些不听讲的人也愿来参加讨论。区上对我们宣传队很关心，经常在工作上帮助鼓励我们。
    七区区委宣传部干事徐康：我们区委宣传部过去不重视机关宣传员的活动，也未很好取得派出所的同志们对宣传队的帮助。在开展群众宣传工作时，今年四、五两月搞得很热烈，曾有很多区级机关干部下去帮助工作，但宣传热潮过后，大家回到原工作岗位上，也就和群众断绝了联系。当时曾留下两三个干部，专门给群众宣传员上大课。但对于宣传员学习以后怎样进行宣传，宣传队内存在些什么问题，讲课的同志很少了解，因而也就不能及时得到解决。由于对宣传队缺乏领导，现在大部分队员的情绪愈来愈低，听大课的人也一天天减少了。
    二区区委宣传部干事李天授：我们区在今年四月有些街道居民曾自发地建立了一些宣传队，但区上未加帮助和领导，大多自生自灭了。只有在第九派出所管段，因为有派出所长的热心帮助，宣传队和其他群众宣传组织一天天巩固和扩大，并创造了每星期一次“抗美援朝日”的办法，对群众进行爱国主义教育，起了很大作用。区委在八月份作了决议，要加强对该段宣传队的领导，派一个干部经常下去帮助，但直到今天，决议还未执行。
    四区公安分局二十一派出所所长谢昉：经过这几个月群众性的抗美援朝宣传活动，居民的政治觉悟大大提高了。群众对检举和监督坏人、防火、防盗表现了很大的积极性。谣言大体上被扑灭了，派出所和群众的关系更加密切了。这就给公安工作创造了有利条件。我以为派出所是可以而且必须作群众宣传工作的。
