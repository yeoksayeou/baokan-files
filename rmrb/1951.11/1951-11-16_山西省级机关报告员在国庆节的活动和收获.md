Activities and Gains of Report Representatives from Shanxi Provincial Organs during the National Day Holiday
	中共山西省委宣传部 (Propaganda Department of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China)
    Following the instructions of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, 345 report representatives from various organs of Shanxi Province went to Yangqu, Xugou, Taigu, Jinyuan (now the Sixth District of Taiyuan City), and other places to deliver reports around National Day. More than 40,000 people attended the report meetings in various locations, reaching 33% of the total local population.
    During this reporting activity, the report representatives from Shanxi provincial organs consciously experimented with the method of fixed reporting areas. When the report representatives from the Party Committee of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government went to Jinyuan to deliver reports, they tried this method. The experiment proved that it has the following advantages: It strengthened the report representatives' sense of responsibility. Before reporting, the report representatives went to understand the work situation and the masses' ideological situation in their reporting area, so that their reports would fully meet the requirements of the local masses. At the same time, it urged the report representatives to consider what methods to use for propaganda in order to better suit the habits of the masses in their reporting areas and achieve greater propaganda results. The report representatives from the Party Committee of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government created the form of a symposium this time. This form was welcomed by the masses, who said, "This solves problems better than holding a general meeting." After reporting to the people, the report representatives paid attention to collecting the masses' reactions to the reports in order to improve the content and form of the reports. After the report representatives gave their reports, they assigned propaganda work to the branches so that the content of their reports would be implemented among the peasant masses. The report representatives responsibly resolved the problems raised by the masses. Therefore, the masses said with satisfaction, "We are familiar with you now, and we dare to say anything with confidence." The village cadres were also very happy and believed that this method could promote the work in the village.
    During this trip to various places to report, the report representatives used various opportunities and organized all forces to carry out propaganda. When the report representatives from the Party Committee of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government went to Yangqu, they selected 14 people on the train to conduct propaganda. After arriving in the village, many report representative groups held meetings with village propagandists, first explaining the main points of the report to them and mobilizing them to cooperate with the propaganda. In addition, they also paid attention to cooperating with the district cadres who went to the countryside to do propaganda. They also held some small-scale picture exhibitions.
    Due to the adoption of the above-mentioned methods, this report yielded great results. After listening to the report on the great achievements of New China in the two years since its founding, the masses more deeply recognized the loveliness of the motherland, thus enhancing their confidence in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and building the motherland. After listening to the report on the "Lancun Incident" (an incident in which special agents killed 49 people), the masses realized that they could not be paralyzed and that they should be vigilant against the sabotage and assassinations of special agents. Everyone said, "The country was not easily won. With the leadership of Chairman Mao, life is getting better day by day; we cannot allow anyone to come and destroy our good times!" When the report representatives reported in Daquangou, Yangqu, five young people immediately signed up to join the volunteer army. After listening to the report, the masses in many villages re-established patriotic covenants.
    Through the reports, the relationship between the masses and the Party and the government became closer. They actively put forward opinions on the work of the People's Government. The main ones included: The masses requested that the government issue more loans; requested that the government assist in building water conservancy projects; requested that the government help purchase more new-style farm tools and fertilizers, and strengthen agricultural technology guidance; requested that the government promptly handle certain captured counter-revolutionaries and promptly arrest and bring to justice counter-revolutionaries who had escaped. They made severe criticisms of illegal acts such as corruption and dereliction of duty by some cadres and demanded that the government deal with them. The above-mentioned opinions have been forwarded by the report representatives to the relevant departments for handling.

　　山西省级机关报告员在国庆节的活动和收获
            中共山西省委宣传部
    遵照中共山西省委的指示，山西省级各机关的三百四十五名报告员，在国庆节前后，分别到阳曲、徐沟、太谷、晋源（现太原市第六区）等地作了报告。在各地报告会上，共到听众四万多人，达到当地人口总数的百分之三十三。
    山西省级机关报告员在这次作报告时，有意识地试验了固定报告地区的办法。山西省人民政府党委会的报告员到晋源作报告时，就试用了这个办法。试验结果，证明有以下好处：加强了报告员的责任心，报告前，报告员就去了解自己作报告的地区的工作情况和群众思想情况，以便使自己的报告完全符合当地群众的要求。同时也督促报告员考虑用什么方式来进行宣传，才能更适合自己作报告的地区的群众的习惯，收到更大的宣传效果。山西省人民政府党委会的报告员，这次创造了座谈会的形式。这种形式受到群众的欢迎，大家说：“这比开大会解决问题。”报告员在向人民群众作报告后，要注意到搜集群众对报告的反应，以改进报告的内容和形式。报告员作过报告后，即给支部布置宣传工作，使自己所报告的内容，贯彻到农民群众中去。对群众提出的问题，报告员均作了负责的解决。因此群众满意地说：“人熟了，啥话也敢放心说了。”村干部也很高兴，认为这种办法能推动村里的工作。
    在这次到各地作报告时，报告员曾利用各种机会和组织一切力量进行了宣传。山西省人民政府党委会报告员去阳曲时，途中就抽了十四个人在列车上作了宣传。到村子后，有不少报告员小组又召开村宣传员会议，先给他们讲解报告要点，动员他们配合宣传。另外还注意了和下乡的区干部协同做宣传。并举办了一些小型图片展览。
    由于采取了上述种种办法，这次报告收获很大。群众在听了关于新中国成立两年以来的伟大成就的报告以后，更深刻地认识到祖国的可爱，因而增强了抗美援朝和建设祖国的信心。在听了关于“兰村事件”（特务杀害群众四十九人的事件）的报告以后，群众认识到不能麻痹，要警惕特务分子的破坏和暗杀。大家说：“江山不是容易得来的，有了毛主席的领导，光景才一天天的好过起来；谁要再来破坏我们的好时光，我们就不能答应他！”报告员在阳曲大泉沟作报告时，当场就有五个青年要报名参加志愿军。许多村子的群众在听了报告后，重订了爱国公约。
    经过报告，群众同党和政府的关系更加密切了。他们对于人民政府工作积极提出意见。其中主要的有：群众要求政府多发些贷款；要求政府协助兴修水利；要求政府帮助多购买些新式农具和肥料，加强农业技术的指导工作；要求政府对某些已捕获的反革命分子迅速处理，对漏网逃跑的反革命分子迅速缉拿归案等。对某些干部的贪污渎职等非法行为，提出了严厉的批评，并要求政府处理。上述的意见，已由报告员转交有关方面处理。
