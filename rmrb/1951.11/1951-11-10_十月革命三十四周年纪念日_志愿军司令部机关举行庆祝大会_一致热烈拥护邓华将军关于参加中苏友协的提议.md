Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, November 9th: The headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army held a gathering on November 7th to grandly celebrate the 34th anniversary of the Soviet October Socialist Revolution. At the meeting, General Deng Hua, Deputy Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, proposed that all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army join the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association as group members.

    General Deng Hua said at the meeting: "Today, as we joyfully celebrate the 34th anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution, we must further consolidate the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and further strengthen the friendly unity between China and the Soviet Union. The close unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union is an invincible force. Because China and the Soviet Union have 700 million people; the armies of China and the Soviet Union are the most powerful armies that win every battle; the unity of the people of China and the Soviet Union will not only inevitably promote the prosperity of China and the Soviet Union, but will also inevitably affect the future of mankind and the victory of world peace and justice. Therefore, the unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union is the hope of the people of the world and one of the greatest interests of the people of the world."

    General Deng Hua said: "The Chinese People's Volunteer Army is an army armed with patriotism and internationalism. In order to further strengthen the deep friendship between our commanders and fighters and the Soviet people and the Soviet army, I specifically propose that all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army join the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association as a group member. In the future, we should widely carry out propaganda and education on Sino-Soviet friendship and the Soviet social system in the troops, and we must make all commanders and fighters realize that the liberated New China and the socialist Soviet Union are flesh and blood related and can never be separated. Our Chinese revolution and construction are all 'learning from Russia', and the Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow. All our commanders and fighters must earnestly and actively learn from the Soviet Union, learn their advanced military science and military experience, improve our combat technical level, and step up the construction of a modern people's army." Finally, General Deng Hua pointed out: "All commanders and fighters of our Volunteer Army must resolutely complete our glorious task of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, defending our motherland and defending world peace, and always stand at the forefront of the struggle, with unparalleled courage and perseverance, resolutely annihilating the enemies who dare to attack!"

    All attendees unanimously and enthusiastically endorsed General Deng Hua's proposal that all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army join the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association as group members. The meeting also passed a telegram from all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to the General Association of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.
