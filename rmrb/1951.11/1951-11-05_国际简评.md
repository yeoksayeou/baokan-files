International Brief Commentary

    The Peace Plan Urgently Needed by the American People
    The American Communist Party published an open letter to U.S. Secretary of State Acheson on October 17, proposing a six-point peace plan demanding that the U.S. government immediately stop the Korean War. This just demand of the American Communist Party represents the widespread and urgent call of the American people, and it will surely be enthusiastically supported by the vast number of peace-loving American people.
    In the year and a half since the United States launched its war of aggression against Korea, it has suffered serious setbacks and casualties. Especially since the Chinese People's Volunteers joined the anti-aggression war in Korea, the number of casualties of the United States and its vassal states' armies has been increasing day by day, recently reaching an unprecedented record of more than 5,600 casualties per day. According to statistics, in the eleven and a half months from October 25 last year to October 10 this year, the number of casualties and prisoners of war of the United States and its vassal states' armies on the Korean battlefield has reached more than 387,000, of which the number of casualties and prisoners of war of the U.S. military has reached more than 176,000. That is to say, because American soldiers were forced to participate in the unjust war of aggression against Korea, 176,000 of them have already made meaningless sacrifices in eleven and a half months. Furthermore, it can be asserted that if the United States continues to adhere to its policy of waging a war of aggression in Korea, it will not only suffer even more serious defeats, but also the number of casualties on the Korean battlefield will increase to an even more serious degree. This means that the American people and American soldiers will have to pay a greater meaningless sacrifice for this unjust war. This is something that the American people cannot but resolutely oppose.
    At the same time, due to the war policy implemented by the United States government, it has frantically exploited the people domestically and strengthened fascist rule politically, depriving the people of their democratic rights. As a result, the political and economic life of the American people has further fallen into despairing pain. U.S. military expenditure will exceed 90 billion U.S. dollars in the 1952 fiscal year (July 1951 – June 1952), making the average annual burden of government expenditure per person in the United States 657 U.S. dollars, which is about one-quarter of the annual salary of a minimum wage earner. Coupled with the scourge of rising prices and unstoppable inflation, the vast number of American working people cannot even maintain a semi-starved life. As for politics, the reactionary U.S. government is constantly persecuting the American Communist Party and other progressive people, and threatening to throw all Americans who advocate democracy and peace into prison. This dark and hopeless tragic life of the American people cannot continue. Their desire for peace and an end to the Korean War is extremely urgent.
    The six-point peace plan proposed by the American Communist Party to the U.S. government is obviously entirely in line with the interests of the American people. If the American people want to end the meaningless sacrifices they have made in the Korean War and their dark and hopeless tragic life, they must resolutely support the peace proposals of the American Communist Party and launch a broad peace movement to force the U.S. government to accept this proposal. Only in this way can they save themselves from greater disasters.
    The American people's call for and struggle to stop the Korean War will inevitably receive the widespread sympathy and support of peace-loving people all over the world.

    国际简评
    美国人民迫切需要的和平方案
    美国共产党于十月十七日发表了致美国国务卿艾奇逊的一封公开信，提出六点和平方案，要求美国政府立即停止朝鲜战争。美国共产党的这一正义主张，代表了美国人民普遍的、急迫的呼声，它必定得到爱好和平的广大美国人民的热烈拥护。
    美国在发动侵略朝鲜战争的一年半以来，已经遭受到严重的挫折与伤亡，尤其是在中国人民志愿军参加朝鲜的反侵略战争以来，美国及其附庸国家军队的伤亡数字更是日益增高，最近已达到每日伤亡五千六百余名的空前纪录。据统计，由去年十月二十五日至今年十月十日的十一个半月中，美国及其附庸国家军队在朝鲜战场上的伤亡及被俘的数字，已达三十八万七千余人，其中美军的伤亡与被俘人数达十七万六千余人。这就是说，美国士兵由于被迫参加了非正义的侵朝战争，在十一个半月中，就已经有十七万六千余人作了无谓的牺牲。并且，可以断言，如果美国继续坚持其在朝鲜进行侵略战争政策的话，它不但要遭受到更为严重的失败，而且它在朝鲜战场上的伤亡数字也要增加到更为严重的程度。这也就是说，美国人民和美国士兵要为这个非正义的战争付出更大的毫无意义的牺牲。这是美国人民不能不加以坚决反对的。
    同时，由于美国政府执行了战争政策，它在国内疯狂地压榨人民，并在政治上加强了法西斯的统治，将人民的民主权利剥夺殆尽。因而，使美国人民的政治和经济生活更进一步陷入于绝望的痛苦之中。美国的军费开支，在一九五二年度（一九五一年七月——一九五二年六月）将超出九百亿美元，使美国人民的每人每年对政府支出的平均负担将达六五七美元，约合最低工资收入者全年工资的四分之一。再加以物价的高涨和不可遏止的通货膨胀的灾祸，使广大的美国劳动人民甚至连半饥饿的生活也不能维持了。至于在政治上，美国反动政府对美国共产党及其他进步人士不断加以迫害，对所有主张民主与和平的美国人都威胁着要投入监狱。美国人民的这种暗无天日的悲惨生活是不能再继续下去的，他们要求和平、要求停止朝鲜战争的心情是极为迫切的。
    美国共产党向美国政府所提出的六点和平方案，显然是完全符合于美国人民的利益的。美国人民如果要终止他们在朝鲜战争中所作的无谓牺牲和他们的暗无天日的悲惨生活，就必须坚决拥护美国共产党的和平主张，并展开广泛的和平运动，来迫使美国政府接受这个主张，也只有这样才能使自己免于更大的灾祸。
    美国人民要求停止朝鲜战争的呼声和斗争，必然会得到世界爱好和平人民的广泛同情和支持。
