　　Preparatory Committee of the Chinese News Publication and Printing Workers' Union
    Protests the Malan Government's Persecution of Progressive Newspapers
    [Our Newspaper's News] The Preparatory Committee of the Chinese News Publication and Printing Workers' Union recently sent a telegram to Malan, the Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa, protesting the reactionary measures taken by the government of the Union of South Africa to fabricate excuses in an attempt to close the progressive South African newspaper "The Vanguard" Weekly. The telegram is as follows:
    To Prime Minister Malan of the Government of the Union of South Africa:
    The workers of the Chinese news publication and printing industry express their infinite anger at your recent reactionary measures attempting to close the progressive South African newspaper "The Vanguard" Weekly, and lodge a serious protest with you. "The Vanguard" Weekly is a progressive newspaper that conveys the just voice of the South African people demanding peace and democracy and opposing racial oppression, and is entirely in line with the interests of the South African people. Therefore, your persecution and destruction of "The Vanguard" Weekly is further persecution and destruction of the South African people. History proves that no reactionary force can stifle the voice of the peace-loving people; on the contrary, the more frantic the reactionary forces become, the sooner they will suffer the consequences of their evil deeds. We believe that if you dare to close "The Vanguard" Weekly, you will certainly meet with a shameful defeat in the face of the South African people!

　　我新闻出版印刷工会筹备委员会
    抗议马兰政府迫害进步报刊
    【本报讯】中国新闻出版印刷工会筹备委员会，顷致电南非联邦政府总理马兰，抗议南非联邦政府制造藉口企图封闭南非联邦进步报纸“前卫”周刊的反动措施。电文如下：南非联邦政府马兰总理：
    中国新闻出版印刷业工人对于最近你们企图封闭南非进步报纸“前卫”周刊这一反动措施，表示无限愤怒，并向你们提出严重抗议。“前卫”周刊是传达南非人民要求和平民主与反对种族压迫的正义声音的进步报纸，是完全符合南非人民的利益的。因此，你们对于“前卫”周刊进行迫害和摧残，也就是对于南非人民的进一步的迫害和摧残。历史证明，任何反动势力决不能窒息和平人民的声音，相反，反动势力愈加疯狂，它也将愈速地自食其恶果。我们相信，如果你们敢于封闭“前卫”周刊，你们一定会在南非人民的面前，遭到可耻的失败！
