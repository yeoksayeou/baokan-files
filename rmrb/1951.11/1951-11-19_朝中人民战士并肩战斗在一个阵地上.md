　　Korean and Chinese People's Fighters Fight Side-by-Side on One Position
　　Wen Qun

　　One evening amidst the flames of war.

　　The Korean People's Army, defending the forward position of a certain high ground, awaited the arrival of the Chinese People's Volunteers, who were to take over the defense that night, with excitement and concern.

　　The hands on the clock pointed to ten o'clock, and the Second Company of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army arrived on time. The position immediately erupted in enthusiastic cheers, and the People's Army soldiers rushed forward to greet them, while the Volunteer Army soldiers also warmly surged forward. They clasped hands tightly, offering each other caring greetings:

　　"Comrades, you've worked hard!"

　　The People's Army soldiers busily carried over boiled water that had been heated seven or eight li away, while the Volunteer Army soldiers took out cigarettes sent by the people of the motherland. Everyone smoked, drank water, and discussed combat experience with each other. At this time, Kim, the battalion commander of the People's Army, was leading Liang, the company commander of the Volunteer Army, to inspect the fortifications and terrain, and to study methods of fighting the enemy. When introducing the situation, Battalion Commander Kim said, "We are under orders from our superiors to remain here for two days and one night with the Volunteer Army before moving out." Company Commander Liang expressed his heartfelt gratitude for the People's Army's spirit of proactively assisting in combat.

　　On the first morning after the arrival of the Volunteer Army, the enemy launched an attack on the position jointly defended by these two fraternal forces. The People's Army and Volunteer Army soldiers fired at the enemy with a dense hail of gunfire and shells. During the battle, several People's Army soldiers were wounded, and Volunteer Army soldiers immediately bandaged their wounds, after which the People's Army soldiers continued to fight bravely. When the Volunteer Army soldiers ran low on ammunition, the People's Army soldiers sent them machine gun bullets and hand grenades. On that day, they repelled three enemy assaults in succession, and over a hundred enemy corpses lay in front of the position.

　　The next day, the enemy concentrated a battalion of troops and launched another fierce attack on our position. Company Commander Liang and Battalion Commander Kim wrote letters to each other in their respective fortifications, encouraging each other: no matter how frantically the enemy attacks, we must inflict even more casualties on them. The Korean and Chinese warriors were all extremely excited and fired fiercely at the swarming enemy. Bao Jinyu, the deputy squad leader of the Volunteer Army's Second Squad, killed several enemies and then, carrying a submachine gun in his left hand and a hand grenade in his right, jumped out of the fortifications and threw the hand grenade forcefully, while the submachine gun rattled. He alone killed or wounded more than seventy enemies. The Volunteer Army's warriors fought so fiercely that the enemy was thrown into chaos. The People's Army's artillery immediately coordinated with the Volunteer Army's infantry, continuously bombarding the enemy's densely packed and disorganized formation. Enemy soldiers fell in batches. Company Commander Liang repeatedly praised, "The People's Army artillery is really firing fiercely and accurately!" Battalion Commander Kim also praised, "The Volunteer Army comrades are so brave! We must learn from the Volunteer Army comrades."

　　After a while, the enemy launched another assault, and the battle became even more intense. Battalion Commander Kim and Company Commander Liang both jumped out of the fortifications and led the Korean and Chinese soldiers in a charge towards the enemy. They shouted in different languages: "Mao Zedong's soldiers, charge bravely!" "Win glory for General Kim Il Sung!" After a burst of shouts and a fierce bayonet fight, they finally repelled the enemy's last assault. More than three hundred enemy corpses lay in front of the position.

　　After fighting side-by-side for two days and one night, the two fraternal forces moved to another position. Before parting, the Korean and Chinese People's fighters shook hands warmly, vowing to each other: no matter which position we are on, we must coordinate and cooperate even better, annihilate more enemies, and severely strike the American aggressors.

    朝中人民战士并肩战斗在一个阵地上
    文群
    在一个战火纷飞的晚上。
    守卫在某高地前沿阵地上的朝鲜人民军，都以兴奋而关切的心情，等待着今晚要来接防的中国人民志愿军。
    表上的时针正指在十点上，志愿军某部第二连按时到达了。阵地上立即响起一片热烈的欢呼声，人民军的战士们纷纷迎上去，志愿军的战士们也亲热地涌过来。他们紧密地握着手，互相关切地慰问：
    “同志，辛苦啦！”
    人民军的战士们忙把在七、八里路外烧的开水抬来，志愿军的战士们也拿出了祖国人民送来的香烟，大家抽着烟，喝着水，互相谈论着作战的经验。这时，人民军金大队长正领着志愿军梁连长巡视着工事和地形，研究着对敌作战的办法。在介绍情况的时候，金大队长说：“我们奉上级的命令，在移防前，还要和志愿军一道在这里守备两天一夜。”梁连长对人民军这种主动协助作战的精神，表示衷心的感谢。
    志愿军来到后的第一个早晨，敌人就向这两支兄弟部队共同坚守着的阵地发起攻击。人民军和志愿军战士们一起用密集的枪火和炮弹向敌人射击。在战斗中，有几个人民军的战士负伤了，志愿军战士马上给他们绑扎伤口，人民军战士又继续英勇战斗。志愿军战士的弹药快打完了，人民军战士就给志愿军送来了机关枪子弹和手雷。这一天，他们接连打退了敌人三次冲锋，阵地前摆着一百多具敌人的死尸。
    第二天，敌人集中了一个营的兵力又向我阵地猛攻。梁连长和金大队长各自在工事里互相写信鼓励：不管敌人怎样疯狂，我们一定要给敌人更多的杀伤。朝中勇士们都万分激奋地向着蜂涌而来的敌人猛烈射击。志愿军二班副班长包金玉打死了几个敌人后，便左手提着冲锋枪，右手拿着手雷，跳出工事，猛力地把手雷扔出去，冲锋枪就哗哗地响起来。他这样一个人就毙伤了七十多个敌人。志愿军的勇士们打得敌人混乱不堪。人民军的炮兵马上配合志愿军步兵，向着敌人密集杂乱的队形连连轰击。敌人一批批地倒下去。梁连长连声赞扬说：“人民军炮兵真打得猛，打得准！”金大队长也夸赞说：“志愿军同志好勇敢啊！向志愿军同志学习。”
    一会，敌人又发起冲锋，战斗更激烈了。金大队长和梁连长都跳出工事，带领着朝中战士，一齐向敌人冲去。他们用不同的语言喊着：“毛泽东的战士，勇猛地冲啊！”“为金日成将军争光！”在一阵杀声和一阵激烈的白刃战之后，终于打退了敌人最后一次冲锋。在阵地前摆了三百多具敌人的尸体。
    这两支兄弟部队并肩作战了两天一夜后，人民军就转移到别处阵地去了。临别前，朝中人民战士们都亲热地握着手，互相保证：不论在那一块阵地上，都一定要更好地协同配合，更多地歼灭敌人，狠狠打击美国侵略者。（新华社）
