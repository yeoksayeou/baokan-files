Conservative Hesitancy to Sell Leads to Capital Accumulation:
China Department Store Fails to Meet October Sales Targets

The conservative hesitancy to sell on the part of leading cadres has resulted in most branch companies under the China Department Store failing to meet their October sales targets. These branch companies had, prior to September of this year, vigorously carried out tasks such as processing, ordering, exclusive sales, and market procurement of industrial goods, preparing sufficient materials to meet the needs of the peak sales season after autumn. However, due to the conservative hesitancy to sell among some leading cadres in the branch companies under the China Department Store, most October sales targets were not met. Many cadres only recognized the inadequacy of industrial goods to meet the needs of the people, but failed to recognize that only by releasing goods could industrial goods prices be stabilized and goods be purchased continuously. Therefore, instead of actively organizing sales, they imposed various restrictions on prices and quantities. For example, the Hebei Department Store stipulated that bicycles would not be discounted during the National Day discount period this year; the Shandong Jiawang sales team limited the amount of cloth sold, stipulating three bolts for large gatherings, two bolts for small gatherings, and one bolt for weekdays. If the number of cloth buyers increased, they would reduce the number of salespersons. According to statistics from the China Department Store, the company's October sales volume only reached 78.5 percent of the monthly plan. The Shanxi Department Store only completed 72.43 percent; the Hebei Department Store only completed 71.5 percent; the Central and Southern District Department Store completed 64.02 percent of the plan; and the Southwestern District Department Store completed 68.36 percent. However, the inventory of each branch of the China Department Store is very large. At the end of the third quarter, the inventory of the Shanxi Department Store was equivalent to 70 percent of the fourth quarter's sales volume; the inventory of the Hebei Department Store at the end of the third quarter was equivalent to 82.58 percent of the fourth quarter's sales volume; the inventory of the Central and Southern District Department Store at the end of the third quarter was equivalent to 109.53 percent of the fourth quarter's sales volume; and the inventory of the Southwestern District Department Store at the end of the third quarter was equivalent to 77.58 percent of the fourth quarter's sales volume.

Because the sales plans of each company cannot be completed on schedule, procurement has been put in a passive state. Some people complain that the higher authorities allocate too little funds, but do not understand that only by completing the sales plan can there be sufficient funds for procurement; and they do not understand that during this peak season, failing to sell goods not only fails to meet the needs of the people but also ties up capital.

This conservative hesitancy to sell manifests itself in the relationship between superiors and subordinates, forming departmentalism. Some companies clearly know that they have a lot of inventory but deliberately say that they have very little, or that the samples are incomplete, or that there are many unsalable goods. Some companies, seeing what goods are lacking, ask the higher authorities for what goods they need, and use the lack of individual commodities as an excuse for failing to complete the sales task. For example, before inspecting the warehouse, the Beijing Department Store insisted that there were many unsalable goods, believing that they would not be able to complete the task; after inspection, it was found that only 0.35 percent of the inventory was unsalable goods. The company often shouts about a shortage of enamelware and thermos bottles, but in reality, the company has a large inventory. In September, the East China Department Store increased procurement funds by 190 billion, and the higher-level company decided that the company should transfer out 100 billion worth of inventory, but the company only transferred out 36 billion. The Central and Southern District Department Store emphasized that most of the inventory was difficult to sell, and the higher-level company planned to transfer out the difficult-to-sell goods, but the company refused to transfer them out.

Some companies do not know or do not fully know the inventory amount and commodity types. For example, the Beijing Department Store initially estimated that the inventory was very small, but after inspection, it was found that the actual inventory was 37 billion yuan greater than the initial estimate. The Hebei Department Store estimated that the inventory at the end of the third quarter was insufficient, but the actual inventory was more than 110 billion yuan more than the estimated inventory. Some companies only know the total value of the goods but do not know the types and quantities of the goods. For example, the Central and Southern District Company shouted about a shortage of sugar everywhere, but the Hunan Province Company in the district had 3.3 million catties of sugar in stock, which could not be sold for a while, which seriously affected the completion of the sales task.

　　保守惜售思想造成资金积压现象
    中国百货公司十月份推销任务未完成
    领导干部的保守惜售思想，使中国百货公司所属分支公司十月份的推销计划多未完成。这些分支公司曾在今年九月份以前，大力进行工业品的加工、订货、包销及市场收购等工作，准备了充分的物资，以迎接秋后旺销季节的需要。但因中国百货公司所属分支公司若干领导干部存在着保守惜售思想，致使十月份的推销任务多未完成。许多干部只认识到工业品不足人民需要，而不认识只有抛出物资，才能稳定工业品价格，并继续购入物资。因此，他们不是积极组织推销，而是在价格与数量上，加以种种限制。如河北省百货公司在今年国庆节减价期间，规定自行车不减价；山东省贾汪百货推销小组限制出售布量，规定大集售三匹，小集售二匹，平日售一匹。如果买布者增多，即减少销货员。据中国百货公司统计，该公司十月份销货额仅完成了月计划的百分之七十八点五。山西省百货公司仅完成百分之七十二点四三；河北省百货公司仅完成百分之七十一点五；中南区百货公司完成计划百分之六十四点零二；西南区百货公司完成百分之六十八点三六。但是，中国百货公司各分支公司的库存量却是很大的。山西省百货公司三季末库存量相当于四季销货额的百分之七十；河北省百货公司三季末库存量相当于四季销货额的百分之八十二点五八；中南区百货公司三季末库存量相当于第四季销货额的百分之一百零九点五三；西南区百货公司三季末库存量相当于第四季销货额的百分之七十七点五八。
    由于各公司销货计划不能按期完成，因而使进货陷于被动。有的人埋怨上级拨款太少，却不了解只有完成销货计划，才有充足款项采购；更不了解在此旺季，不把商品推销出去，既不能供应人民需要，又会积压资金。
    这种保守惜售思想，表现在上下级关系上，形成本位主义。有的公司明知库存商品很多，却故意说库存很少、或者货样不全、残背货多。有些公司，看见什么货缺，就向上级要什么货，并以缺少个别商品作为完不成销货任务的藉口。例如：北京市百货公司检查仓库前，硬说冷货背货很多，认为完不成任务；经过检查，发现库存商品中，只有百分之零点三五是冷货背货。该公司经常喊着缺搪瓷品和暖水壶，实际上该公司库存很多。华东区百货公司九月份增加采购资金一千九百亿，上级公司决定由该公司调出价值一千亿元的库存商品，但该公司仅调出三百六十亿。中南区百货公司强调库存商品大多不好销，上级公司拟将不好销的商品调出，该公司又不肯调出。
    有些公司不知道或不完全知道库存金额和商品种类。例如：北京市百货公司最初估计库存量很小，经过检查，发现实有库存数大于最初估计数三百七十亿元。河北省百货公司估计三季末库存商品不足，结果实际库存比估计库存数多出一千余亿元。有的公司只知道商品的总值金额，不知道商品的种类与数量。如中南区公司到处嚷糖缺，但该区湖南省公司存糖三百三十万斤，一时销不出去，这就严重地影响推销任务的完成。（中国百货公司）
