　　State-Run Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Mill Workers
    Respond to Call for a Crash Program to Increase Yarn and Cloth Production
    To the Editor: All the workers of the state-run Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Mill enthusiastically responded to the call for a crash program to increase production issued by the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government and the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China. Workers in each workshop have put forward guaranteed plans for a crash program to increase production, triggering a surge of challenges between workshops and groups. The spinning workers stated that they would actively learn the Hao Jianxiu fine yarn method to improve the quality and quantity of products; the weaving workers also stated that they would reduce waste yarn and eliminate substandard cloth to increase productivity and reduce costs. Tianjin First-Class Labor Models Wang Bao'an and Liu Yishu said: "In order to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and to meet the urgent need for yarn and cloth for our farmer brothers, we will step up production, conserve materials, and strive to complete the tasks assigned to us by our superiors." The yarn yard packaging workshop put forward several plans to challenge other textile factories in Tianjin: (1) Guarantee to improve output quality and save mechanical materials; (2) Guarantee to implement various systems and conduct regular inspections of the Patriotic Pact; (3) Guarantee an attendance rate of 99% or more; (4) Guarantee no accidents occur, and prevent spies and secret agents anytime, anywhere.

　　国营天津第一棉纺织厂职工
    响应突击增产纱布号召
    编辑同志：国营天津第一棉纺织厂全体职工，热烈响应中央人民政府纺织工业部和中国纺织工会全国委员会发出的突击增产的号召。该厂各车间工人纷纷提出突击增产的保证计划，掀起了车间与小组互相挑战的热潮。纺纱工人们表示了一定积极学习郝建秀细纱工作法，来提高产品的质量、数量；织布工人们也表示要减少回丝，消灭次布，来提高生产率与降低成本。天津市一等劳动模范王宝安、刘以树说：“我们为了支持中国人民志愿军，以及供应农民兄弟们的纱布的迫切需要，一定加紧生产、节约物料，努力完成上级给我们的任务。”纱场成包车间提出几项计划向天津市各纺织厂挑战：（一）保证提高产量质量，节约机物料；（二）保证执行各项制度以及定期检查爱国公约；（三）保证出勤率达到百分之九十九以上；（四）保证不发生一切事故，随时随地防奸细防特务。
