　　Continue to Advance on the Road to Enduring World Peace
    The Second Session of the World Peace Council closed on the 7th of this month, after adopting a series of important resolutions on continuing the struggle for lasting world peace. The very next day, on the 8th of this month, Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation to the Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, delivered a speech at the UN General Assembly, putting forward four proposals on measures to eliminate the threat of another world war and consolidate international peace and friendship. In the current international situation, where the forces of war and peace are engaged in an unprecedentedly fierce struggle, the resolutions of the Second Session of the World Peace Council and the Soviet government's four proposals to the United Nations are undoubtedly of extreme importance.
    The reason why world peace is currently facing an unprecedentedly serious threat and the international situation is exceptionally dangerous is precisely because the imperialist countries, first and foremost the United States, disregarding the peace aspirations of the people of the world and all the sincere efforts made by the Soviet Union to eliminate the new war crisis and consolidate international peace and friendship, have adopted a brutal and barbaric policy of aggression. In the past year, because the United States has hijacked the United Nations and forced other countries to further accept and implement its policy of aggressive war, stepping up the deployment of aggressive war, it has aroused even stronger resentment and resolute resistance among the peace-loving people of the world against American and British imperialism. In the past year, the strength of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union has greatly strengthened, the movement to defend world peace has greatly developed, and the people of the entire Asia and North Africa have vigorously risen to fight for independence and liberation. All this powerfully demonstrates that: on the one hand, imperialist aggression is increasingly threatening peaceful humanity; on the other hand, the struggle of the people of the world to defend peace is increasingly strengthening. Peace and war are in struggle.
    The imperialist aggressive war bloc headed by the United States is barbarously slaughtering peaceful people and destroying peaceful construction in Korea; they are stepping up arms expansion and war preparations, openly arming Japan and West Germany; they are expanding war bases, plundering the wealth of people of all countries, especially the resources of colonial and semi-colonial countries, and armed intervention and suppressing the revolutionary movements of people of all countries; they are continuing to form the North Atlantic, Pacific and Middle East aggressive blocs to serve their planned new war adventures. Therefore, the peace-loving people of the world must continue to fight to strengthen the defense of world peace in order to completely defeat the arrogant and barbaric plan of imperialism to conquer the world by force.
    Achieving a ceasefire in Korea and the conclusion of an armistice agreement by the warring parties in Korea is the primary step in striving for peace and stopping the disaster of war. This is because peace in this region has been severely damaged due to the barbaric aggression of the United States. Since July this year, although the United States, under the pressure of its military failure and the pressure of world people and progressive public opinion, has accepted the just proposal of Malik, the Soviet representative to the United Nations Security Council, and has begun to conduct armistice negotiations with the representatives of the Korean and Chinese people, the United States has continuously obstructed and sabotaged the negotiations, so that no agreement has been reached on any issue so far. U.S. President Truman's radio speech on the 7th of this month and U.S. Secretary of State Acheson's speech to the United Nations General Assembly on the 8th of this month nakedly and openly confessed their ambition to use the Korean armistice negotiations to step up arms expansion and force other countries to follow the United States in expanding aggression. In his speech, which he called a "disarmament" proposal, Truman shamelessly stated: as long as the Korean War
    "is continuing" and "the major political problems that divide the world cannot be resolved, it is impossible to make real progress in reducing armaments"; while Acheson openly demanded that its vassal states continue to make "the greatest contribution in troops and other needs" to the war of aggression against Korea. This is enough to explain why, in the Korean negotiations, despite the extremely patient and actively striving for agreement attitude shown by the representatives of the Korean and Chinese people, the two sides still cannot reach an agreement on any issue. As Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation to the Sixth Session of the United Nations, said: "The best way to ensure a good outcome to the Korean negotiations is for the U.S. government to order its General Ridgway not to obstruct the negotiations with various incidents, and not to create artificial obstacles to prevent the Kaesong negotiations from achieving good results. Is there any doubt about this?" Therefore, the U.S. government and its negotiators must abandon their policy of obstructing and sabotaging the Korean armistice negotiations, and must retract their fraudulent and unreasonable attitude and show genuine sincerity in the negotiations, otherwise, the negotiations will not have any results, and what the American generals can get from their delaying policy will only be greater casualties and failures.
    The threat of war formed by the U.S. policy of aggressive war is also manifested in the expansion of the arms race being carried out in the United States and other capitalist countries. This race towards war and destruction has now reached an extremely insane level. The well-known fact is that the U.S. military expenditure budget for 1952 has reached 81.8 billion U.S. dollars. If we add the secretly announced "special expenditure" for the Korean War, the U.S. military expenditure for 1952 will exceed the astronomical figure of more than 90 billion U.S. dollars. In Western Europe, the United States is stepping up the arming of West Germany and attempting to establish an aggressive force of 20 divisions for Eisenhower's European aggressive army this year; in Asia, it is openly arming Japan and continuing the war of aggression against Korea; and in other parts of the world, it is building airports and establishing aggressive military bases. The U.S. policy of arms expansion and war preparations has obviously brought the entire capitalist world economy into an unprecedented disaster, producing serious consequences of economic bankruptcy. Britain, France and other capitalist countries in Western Europe are now feeling the profound crisis of economic bankruptcy. In his first speech in the British House of Commons after taking office, Churchill had to admit that the continued development of the war economy "will eventually lead to national bankruptcy." The credit of the franc, like the pound, is declining, causing the capitalist world to repeatedly spread the news that the pound and the franc will be devalued again. There is no doubt that the increasingly heavy military burden is the only reason for inflation, rising prices, and economic chaos in these countries (including the United States). Even Truman himself had to admit that the "military burden" "now weighs so heavily on the world's shoulders." This is the root cause of the increasingly impoverished lives of the people of the United States and other capitalist countries. In 1950, the taxes of the major capitalist countries had increased five to ten times compared to before the war, and in 1951, many capitalist countries continued to increase new taxes. This is in stark contrast to the increasingly prosperous economy and the increasingly affluent lives of the people in the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries in peaceful construction. Therefore, the World Peace Council and the Soviet delegation to the United Nations demanded and suggested that countries implement large-scale reductions in troops and armaments, and prohibit atomic weapons and all other weapons of mass slaughter, and, according to the Soviet government's proposal, hold a world conference before June 1, 1952 to study implementation methods. This is not only absolutely necessary to ensure world peace, but also extremely helpful to improve the lives of the people of various capitalist countries.
    Under the pressure of their own people and the peace-loving people of the world, the U.S. government and the British and French governments that follow it have had to say that their arms expansion movement is a last resort, and even "willing to take measures to reduce all armed forces and all armaments, including atomic armaments" (note! they only propose "reduction" for atomic armaments), and also submitted the so-called "three-nation arms control proposal" to the Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly. In order to carry out arms expansion and war preparations, the United States, Britain, and other countries have resorted to slander and fabrication of the excuse of a "communist country's threat of aggression." But in fact, no country has ever had any intention of attacking the United States, Britain, or France. They fabricated this excuse only to deceive and force the people to make meaningless sacrifices for their war plans. As for what kind of proposal their "arms control proposal" is, it is not, as they say, a "proposal to reduce all armed forces and all armaments, including atomic armaments." On the contrary, it is a "proposal" to continue to expand armaments and delay the demands of the people of all countries for a reduction in troops and armaments. U.S. President Truman, in his speech on this "disarmament" proposal, shamelessly continued to clamor for arms expansion, and said: "The strengthening of the free world's defense (referring to the imperialist countries' aggressive war preparations) is a way to seek security and peace. As things stand now, this is the only way before us." Therefore, the plan in their proposal puts the step of "verifying" the troops and armaments of various countries above all else, and if, after
    "verification", the Korean War "is still continuing" and "the main political problems that divide the world cannot be resolved," then "this overall plan cannot be implemented." Obviously, this is in no way similar to the genuine demands and proposals for reducing troops and armaments put forward by the World Peace Council and the Soviet Union in order to eliminate the threat of war and improve the international tense situation. It is only a cover for the United States, Britain, and other countries to deceive the people of the world and continue to strengthen arms expansion and war preparations. But this ostrich-like farce cannot deceive the eyes and ears of the people of the world. If they are truly sincere in reducing troops and armaments to eliminate the crisis of war, they should sincerely accept the suggestions of the World Peace Council and the Soviet Union. Otherwise, it can only make the peace-loving people of the world more clearly recognize their determination to be enemies of the peaceful aspirations of the people of the world. There will be no other result besides this.
    The suggestion and request of the World Peace Council and the Soviet Union to repeatedly propose the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers has been warmly embraced and widely supported by the people of countries around the world. Five hundred and sixty-two million people in sixty-four countries around the world have signed in support of the conclusion of a peace pact. China and the Soviet Union have expressed their warm welcome and complete willingness to conclude a peace pact more than once, but the governments of the United States, Britain, and France have repeatedly stubbornly and unreasonably rejected this peace proposal. This makes it easy to draw the conclusion that the main obstacle to the conclusion of a peace pact is the attitude of the governments of the United States, Britain, and France. Because of this, the World Peace Council has once again proposed to the people of all countries in the world to continue to strengthen the movement to demand the conclusion of a peace pact, and the Soviet government has once again proposed this proposal to the United Nations in order to force the warmongering governments of the United States, Britain, and France to accept the peaceful aspirations of the people of the world.
    The World Peace Council's resolution on the separate peace treaty with Japan and the denunciation of the U.S. separate peace treaty with Japan in the speech by Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, prove that this treaty, signed under the direction of the United States to enslave Japan and prepare for war in Asia, is nothing more than a scrap of paper for the people of Asian countries (including the people of Japan). It cannot have any effect and can only arouse the anger and resistance of the people of Asia and the people of Japan. In its resolution condemning the separate peace treaty with Japan, the World Peace Council urged the peace-loving people of the Asian and Pacific regions to hold a regional conference to defend peace at the earliest appropriate date. This is undoubtedly what the people of these countries in the Asian and Pacific regions are eagerly expecting. The holding of this conference will inevitably enable the people of these countries to further strengthen their unity and fight to the end to smash the U.S. plan to enslave Japan and prepare for war in Asia.
    The various important resolutions of the Second Session of the World Peace Council and the Soviet government's unwavering policy of peace and its consistent and steadfast efforts to consolidate world peace will continue to inspire the peace-loving people of the world to strive to defend the cause of world peace to the end. The forces of world peace and democracy have greatly exceeded the forces of imperialism. People of all countries who love peace, as well as patriotic people in colonial and semi-colonial countries who are fighting for independence and liberation, should more courageously persevere in their struggles! The era of imperialism's domination of the world has long been declared over; the peace-loving people of the world will surely be able to defeat the imperialist conspiracy of aggressive war!
    The Chinese people, who are fighting to defend world peace will firmly support the resolutions of the Second Session of the World Peace Council and the four proposals made by the Soviet government to the United Nations General Assembly and will wage an unyielding struggle to achieve the goals stipulated in these resolutions and proposals.

### 在争取世界持久和平的道路上继续前进

　　在争取世界持久和平的道路上继续前进
    世界和平理事会第二届会议在通过了继续争取世界持久和平的各项重大决议后，已在本月七日闭幕。紧接着的第二天，本月八日，出席第六届联合国大会的苏联代表团团长维辛斯基，在联合国全体会议上发表演说，提出了关于消除另一次世界大战的威胁和巩固国际和平与友好的措施的四项建议。在战争与和平势力正进行着空前激烈斗争的国际形势下，世界和平理事会第二届会议的各项决议和苏联政府对联合国所提出的四项建议，无疑有极重要的意义。
    目前世界和平之所以遭受空前严重的威胁，国际形势之所以分外险恶，正是因为帝国主义国家，首先是美国，不顾世界人民的和平愿望，不顾苏联为消除新的战争危机和巩固国际和平与友好所作的一切真诚的努力，而采取了横暴野蛮的侵略政策的结果。过去一年来，由于美国挟持联合国，并迫使其他国家进一步接受与执行它的侵略战争政策，加紧侵略战争的部署，因而激起了世界爱好和平人民对美英帝国主义更加强烈的愤恨和坚决的反抗。过去一年来，以苏联为首的和平民主阵营国家的力量大大地加强了，保卫世界和平运动大大地发展了，整个亚洲和北部非洲各国人民争取独立解放运动蓬蓬勃勃地起来了。这一切都有力地说明着：一方面是帝国主义的侵略日益威胁着和平的人类；另一方面是世界人民保卫和平的斗争日益加强。和平与战争正在搏斗中。
    以美国为首的帝国主义侵略战争集团正在朝鲜野蛮地屠杀和平人民、毁灭和平建设；它们正在加紧扩军备战，公开地武装日本和西德；它们正在扩张战争基地，掠夺各国人民的财富，尤其是殖民地半殖民地国家的资源，武装干涉和镇压各国人民的革命运动；它们正在继续组成北大西洋的、太平洋的和中东的侵略集团，来为它们所策划的新的战争冒险计划服务。因此，世界爱好和平的人民必须继续为加强保卫世界和平而斗争，以彻底击败帝国主义企图以武力征服世界的狂妄的和野蛮的计划。
    实现朝鲜停火，由在朝鲜的交战双方缔结停战协定，是争取和平、制止战争灾害的首要步骤。这是因为这个地区的和平，由于美国的野蛮侵略，已经遭受到了严重的破坏。今年七月以来，美国虽然迫于它的军事失败和世界人民与进步舆论的压力，接受了苏联驻联合国安全理事会代表马立克的公正建议，与朝中人民代表开始进行停战谈判，然而在谈判的过程中，美国却不断地阻挠和破坏谈判的进行，以致在任何问题上至今还没有得到协议。美国总统杜鲁门于本月七日发表的广播演说和美国国务卿艾奇逊于本月八日在联合国大会上所发表的演说，便赤裸裸地、公开地供认了它们企图利用朝鲜停战谈判，以加紧进行扩军并迫使其他国家追随美国实行扩大侵略的野心。杜鲁门在他的号称为“裁军”建议的演说中，竟无耻地表示：只要朝鲜战争
    “尚在继续”，“分裂世界的主要政治问题还不能获得解决，要想在裁减军备方面取得真正进展，是不可能的”；而艾奇逊则公然要求其附庸国家，继续对侵略朝鲜的战争“在军队及其他需要方面作最大的贡献”。这足以说明为什么在朝鲜谈判中，尽管朝中人民代表表现了极为忍耐的和积极争取协议的态度，而双方依然不能在任何问题上取得协议的真正原因了。正如苏联出席联合国第六届大会代表团团长维辛斯基所说的：“保证朝鲜谈判得到良好结局的最好的办法，就是由美国政府命令它的李奇微将军不要用各种事件来妨碍谈判，不要制造人为的障碍来不让开城谈判得到良好的成就，这难道还能有怀疑的余地吗？”因此，美国政府和它的谈判代表必须抛弃它们阻挠和破坏朝鲜停战谈判的政策，必须收回它欺诈无理的态度而表现出真正的谈判诚意来，否则，谈判是不会有结果的，而美国将军们从自己的拖延政策所能得到的，就只会是更大的死伤和失败。
    由于美国的侵略战争政策而形成的战争威胁，同时还表现在它所推动的、在美国及其他资本主义国家所进行的扩张军备竞赛。这种走向战争和毁灭的竞赛，在目前已达到了极端疯狂的程度。人所周知的事实是：美国一九五二年度的军事支出预算，已达八百十八亿美元，如果再加上秘而不宣的朝鲜战争的“特别开支”，一九五二年度美国的军事开支将要超出九百亿美元以上的天文数字了。美国在西欧正在加紧武装西德并企图为艾森豪威尔的欧洲侵略军在今年建立二十个师的侵略部队；在亚洲正在公开武装日本，并继续进行侵略朝鲜的战争；在世界其他各处则正在修筑飞机场，建立侵略军事基地。美国的扩军备战政策，显然已将整个资本主义世界经济带入了前所未有的灾难中去，产生着严重的经济破产的后果。英法及西欧其他资本主义国家现在正感受到经济破产的深刻危机。邱吉尔上台后第一次在英国下院的发言中，即不得不承认备战经济的继续发展，“到时候一定会造成国家的破产”。法郎的信用和英镑一样，正在日益低落中，使资本主义世界一再传出英镑和法郎将再度贬值的消息。无庸置疑，越来越重的军费负担是这些国家（包括美国在内）通货膨胀、物价高涨、经济陷于混乱的唯一原因。甚至连杜鲁门自己也不得不承认“军备负担”“现在如此沉重地压在世界肩上”。这就是美国和其他资本主义国家人民生活越来越贫困的根源。在一九五○年，各主要资本主义国家的捐税，比起战前就已增加了五倍至十倍，而在一九五一年，许多资本主义国家还继续增加了新税。这和苏联与人民民主国家在和平建设中经济日益繁荣，人民生活日益富裕的情形，恰恰成了一个鲜明的对照。因此，世界和平理事会和苏联出席联合国代表团要求和建议各国实行大量裁减军队和军备，以及禁止原子武器及其他一切大规模屠杀的武器，并按照苏联政府的建议，于一九五二年六月一日以前举行世界会议，以研究实施办法。这不但对于保障世界和平是完全必要的，而且对于改善各资本主义国家人民的生活也是极有帮助的。
    美国政府及追随它的英、法两国政府，在它们本国人民和世界爱好和平人民的压力下，不得不把它们的扩军运动说成是不得已的，甚至“愿意采取办法裁减一切武装部队和包括原子军备在内的一切军备”（注意！它们对于原子军备也只提出“裁减”），并且还向第六届联合国大会提出了所谓“三国军备管制建议”。美英等国为了进行扩军备战，不惜血口喷人，制造藉口——“共产党国家的侵略威胁”。但是事实上并没有任何国家有过进攻美国、英国或法国的任何打算，它们虚构这种藉口，只是为了要欺骗和强迫人民为它们的战争计划作无谓的牺牲。至于它们的“军备管制建议”是什么样的建议呢？那不但不是如它们所说的“裁减一切武装部队和包括原子军备在内的一切军备的建议”，反之是要继续扩张军备和拖延各国人民要求裁减军队和军备的“建议”。美国总统杜鲁门在他为这个“裁军”建议所发表的演说中，就曾恬不知耻地继续叫嚣扩张军备，并且说：“自由世界防务（按系指帝国主义国家的侵略备战部署）的增强是谋求安全与和平的一个办法。照现在情形来看，这是我们面前的唯一办法。”因而，它们建议中的方案便把“查验”各国的军队和军备的步骤放在一切之上，而如果在
    “查验”之后，朝鲜战争“尚在继续”，“分裂世界的主要政治问题还不能获得解决”时，则“这个总方案是不能执行的”。显然的，这与世界和平理事会和苏联为消除战争威胁、改善国际紧张局势而提出的真正的裁减军队与军备的要求和建议，是毫无相似之处的。它只是美英等国欺骗世界人民和继续加强扩军备战的掩饰而已。但是这种掩耳盗铃的丑剧，是欺瞒不了世界人民的耳目的。它们如果真有裁减军队和军备以消除战争危机的诚意，就应当真心地接受世界和平理事会和苏联的建议，否则就只能使全世界爱好和平的人民，更加认清它们与世界人民和平愿望为敌的决心。除此而外，是不会有其他的结果的。
    世界和平理事会和苏联所一再提出的五大国缔结和平公约的建议和要求，已得到了世界各国人民的热烈拥护和普遍支持。全世界已有六十四个国家的五亿六千二百万人签名拥护缔结和平公约。中苏两国已不止一次表示过热烈欢迎而且完全愿意缔结和平公约，而美、英、法三国政府却一再蛮横无理地对这一和平建议加以拒绝。这就不难使人得出一个结论：缔结和平公约的主要障碍，是美、英、法三国政府的态度。正因为如此，世界和平理事会才再度向世界各国人民提出继续加强要求缔结和平公约的运动，苏联政府又一次向联合国提出这个建议，以迫使好战的美、英、法三国政府接受世界人民的和平愿望。
    世界和平理事会关于单独对日和约的决议，和苏联代表团团长维辛斯基在联合国大会的演说中对美国单独对日和约的指斥，证明了这个在美国导演下所签订的奴役日本和在亚洲准备战争的条约，对于亚洲各国人民（包括日本人民在内）不过是一张废纸。它不能发生任何效力，只能激起亚洲人民和日本人民的愤怒和反抗。世界和平理事会在谴责单独对日和约的决议中，并敦促亚洲和太平洋区域的和平人民在最早的适当日期，举行保卫和平的区域会议。这无疑是亚洲和太平洋区域各国人民所热烈期望的。这个会议的举行，必然会使这些国家的人民进一步加强团结，为粉碎美国奴役日本和在亚洲准备战争的计划而斗争到底。
    世界和平理事会第二届会议的各项重大决议，和苏联政府坚定不移的和平政策及其为巩固世界和平所作的一贯的坚贞努力，将继续鼓舞着世界爱好和平的人民为着将世界和平事业保卫到底而努力奋斗。世界和平民主的力量已经大大地超过了帝国主义的力量，各国爱好和平的人民以及殖民地半殖民地国家为争取独立解放而斗争的爱国人民，更加英勇地坚持斗争吧！帝国主义称霸世界的时代早已宣告结束了；世界爱好和平的人民是一定能够战胜帝国主义的侵略战争阴谋的！
    为保卫世界和平而斗争的中国人民，将坚决拥护世界和平理事会第二届会议的各项决议和苏联政府向联合国大会所提的四项建议，并为实现这些决议和建议所规定的目标而进行不屈不挠的斗争。
