Letter Summary

    Leting's Ma Yangzhuang Village Does a Good Job in Sideline Production to Support the Volunteer Army
    After the autumn harvest was basically over, village cadres and production activists in Ma Yangzhuang Village, Leting County, Hebei Province, put forward the slogan "Do a good job in sideline production and support the Volunteer Army." Under their leadership, 122 men and women, young and old, from 45 of the village's 60 households actively participated in the work of weaving baskets and weaving "xuezi" (grain storage containers). From September 20 to the end of October, the village's weaving income reached 20 million yuan. Zhang Zhihong, a military family member, earned 7.8 million yuan alone. After doing a good job in sideline production and increasing income, the village donated 2.8 million yuan to support the Volunteer Army. The remainder was mostly used to buy production tools such as new sickles, hoes, and fertilizers, preparing for increasing the yield per unit area next year.

    Jin County's Zhoujiazhuang Achieves Results in Organizing Joint Cotton Sales for Cotton Farmers
    Zhoujiazhuang Village, Jin County, Hebei Province, planted more than 5,000 mu of cotton this year (the village has 7,000 mu of cultivated land) and won the title of "Cotton Planting Model Village." Recently, the village cadres also came up with a method of organizing joint cotton sales for cotton farmers: the cotton farmers collectively send the cotton to the cotton collection station. After grading and weighing, an accountant is left behind to keep accounts and bring the money back to the village, where the accountant distributes it to the cotton farmers, saving them the time of selling cotton and collecting money. This method has been supported by the cotton farmers. As of October 28, the village had sold 230,000 jin of seed cotton. Many cotton farmers, not urgently needing the money, store their cotton in cooperatives or deposit the money from selling cotton in the National Bank.

    Yi County Farmer Representatives Determine to Improve Agricultural Production Technology After Visiting the North China Urban and Rural Material Exchange Exhibition
    Twenty-eight farmer representatives (including seven women) from Yi County, Hebei Province, returned to the county on October 13 after visiting the North China Urban and Rural Material Exchange Exhibition. They talked about their feelings at a symposium. Zhang Zhengang, the representative of Liaoshui Village in the Fifth District, said that before visiting the exhibition, he had always been unable to understand the saying "workers leading farmers, cities leading the countryside." After visiting the exhibition, he truly realized the power of the workers and that only when workers lead farmers and cities lead the countryside can the country be built well. Some representatives said that they wanted to buy new-style agricultural tools together through mutual aid. Some representatives also said that they would return to the village to promote the Soviet experience of raising 600-jin-weight pigs. Finally, everyone unanimously guaranteed to carefully convey what they had learned from the visit to everyone in the village.

    All Staff and Workers of Datong Coal Mine Donate Winter Clothing to Relieve Disaster-Stricken Farmer Brothers in Chahar Province
    The staff and workers of various mines and factories of Datong Coal Mine and their families enthusiastically donated winter clothing to relieve the disaster-stricken farmer brothers in Chahar Province. The workers said: The farmer brothers are good helpers of the working class. They made great efforts in the revolutionary struggle. Now that the farmer brothers are in trouble, we must help them. Zhang Yonghua, a clerk in the mine, donated his cotton overcoat. Li Shanqing, a worker at the Majiliang Mine, donated 70,000 yuan at the beginning. According to statistics, the various mines and factories donated a total of 63.051 million yuan for winter clothing, as well as 44 single, lined cotton velvet coats. These achievements fully demonstrate the spirit of mutual assistance of the working class.

    Feng Letai, Head of the Militia of Sipu Village in Shanyin County, and Others Mobilize the Masses to Hand Over Railway Materials
    After Huang Youdao, a railway protection militia member of Sipu Village, Shanyin County, Chahar Province, heard the news of Hao Shengxiu and other farmers in Anliangpu Village handing over railway materials at a mass meeting at the end of October conveyed by Feng Letai and Liang Changlong, the militia captains of the village, he immediately went home and dug out a small steel rail buried underground for many years and handed it over to the state. At the same time, as a result of the in-depth mobilization by Feng and Liang, the farmers in the village automatically handed over more than 70 kilograms of railway materials. On November 1, Feng and Liang pushed the railway materials to the Daiyue Station Public Security Substation with a small handcart and asked them to transfer them to the Daiyue Engineering Section Material Factory. The above situation fully demonstrates the improvement of the awareness of the New China's farmers.

    The Wendeng Prefectural Committee of the CPC Instructs County Committees to Pay Attention to Letters and Visits from the Masses
    In the past, the counties in the Wendeng Special District of Shandong Province did not handle letters from the masses seriously enough, and there were backlogs and no one to manage them. To this end, the Wendeng Prefectural Committee specially studied this work at a recent meeting of county secretaries, and all localities have begun to establish systems for forwarding, assigning, conducting on-site investigations, having responsible comrades review and handle, keeping copies, archiving, and reporting. However, some units have not seriously carried out this work. To this end, the Wendeng Prefectural Committee has instructed all counties to carefully check and summarize the recent work on letters and visits from the masses and report to the Prefectural Committee. It also pointed out: No matter how busy the work is, the work of letters and visits from the masses and answering questions from the masses cannot be squeezed out. I think that the Wendeng Prefectural Committee's style of attaching importance to mass work is worth promoting.

    More Slide and Movie Teams Should Be Organized to Go to the Countryside
    The Shandong Provincial Department of Culture and Education's movie team has been warmly welcomed by the masses when touring and screening movies in the countryside.
    One night, the movie team was showing a movie in Zhanglizhuang, Jishan District, Juyue County. As soon as the machine was turned on, the entire audience listened and watched attentively. When they saw Chairman Mao's image, everyone applauded and shouted, "Please, Chairman Mao, walk slowly, let us recognize you again!" After the film was over, everyone stayed for a long time, surrounding the comrades of the film team, asking questions. Many people said gratefully, "If it weren't for the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the People's Government caring about us, the people in this mountain gully would not be able to see movies for dozens of generations."
    I think more slide and movie teams should be organized to go to the countryside for propaganda.

    Guards Escorting Prisoners on Trains Should Be More Vigilant to Prevent Jumping Train Accidents
    Since the People's Daily published our team's letter requesting a ban on passengers jumping off trains on January 15 this year, it has indeed achieved significant results. Taking the trains guarded by our team as an example, there were 63 jumping train incidents from January to August, and the death and injury rate decreased by more than 88% compared with last year. However, there are still guards escorting prisoners who do not contact the train police and are negligent. For example, on the Beijing-Changchun line No. 106 train on August 18, Ji Jingbo and two others from the Public Security Team of the Shanxi Provincial Mining Area were escorting two prisoners. Because they were dozing off, one prisoner jumped off the train and escaped when the train was outside the signal at Daying Station (the fugitive has now been captured). Another time, when the prisoner wanted to defecate, they unlocked his handcuffs. These facts prove that their negligence has reached an extreme level. Of the 63 incidents, 15 were due to such irresponsible situations. I think this matter should be brought up to draw everyone's attention.
    Wang Hui, Captain of the Guard Team, Beijing Branch, Tianjin Railway Bureau Public Security Department

    乐亭马杨庄村搞好副业生产支援志愿军
    河北乐亭县马杨庄村在秋收基本结束后，村干部和生产积极分子即提出“搞好副业生产，支援志愿军”的口号。在他们带头下，全村六十户人家有四十五户的男女老小一百二十二人，积极参加了编篓子、编穴子（装粮食的囤子）的工作，从九月二十日到十月底，全村编织收入共达二千万元，军属张志洪一人即赚了七十八万元。搞好了副业生产，增加了收入后，全村即捐献了二百八十万元，支援志愿军；其余大部买了生产工具，如新镰刀、锄头、肥料等，给明年提高单位面积产量作好了准备。

    晋县周家庄组织棉农联售的办法有成绩
    河北晋县周家庄今年种了五千多亩棉花，（该村有耕地七千亩）获得了“植棉模范村”的称号。最近，该村干部还想出了组织棉农联售的办法：棉农集体将棉花送到收棉站，经分级过秤后，留一个会计算账，把款带回本村，由会计发给棉农，节省了棉农卖棉取款的时间。这一办法受到了棉农的拥护。截至十月二十八日止，该村已售出籽棉二十三万斤。不少棉农因不急用钱，将棉花存在合作社里，或把卖棉花的钱存到国家银行。

    河北易县二十八个农民代表（内妇女七人），参观华北区城乡物资交流展览会后，已于十月十三日返县。他们在一次座谈会上，谈了自己的感想。五区潦水村的代表张振纲说，他在参观以前，一直对
    “工人领导农民、城市领导乡村”的说法想不通。这次参观展览会后，他才真正认识到工人的力量，只有工人领导农民，城市领导农村，国家才能建设好。有的代表表示要互助伙买新式农具。还有的代表说要回村宣传推广苏联养成六百斤重猪的经验。最后大家一致保证把参观所得回村仔细传达给大伙儿知道。　贾书堂　贾尚仁
    大同煤矿全体职工捐献寒衣救济察省受灾农民兄弟
    大同煤矿各矿、厂的职工以及家属们，热烈捐献寒衣，救济察哈尔省受灾的农民兄弟。工友们说：农民兄弟们，是工人阶级的好帮手。他们在革命斗争中，出了很大力气，现在农民兄弟有了困难，我们一定要帮助他们。该矿职员张永华，把自己的一件棉大衣献了出来。马脊梁矿工人李善清一开始就捐了七万元。据统计，这次各矿厂单位共捐募寒衣费六千三百零五万一千元，单夹棉绒衣四十四件，这些成绩，充分表现了工人阶级的互助精神。

    山阴县四铺村民兵队长冯乐台等发动群众献交铁路器材
    察哈尔省山阴县四铺村护路民兵黄有道，自该村民兵队长冯乐台、梁长龙于十月底在群众大会上传达安良铺村农民郝生秀等献交铁路器材的消息后，立即回家将埋在地下好几年的一根小型钢轨刨出来献给国家。同时，由于冯、梁两人深入动员的结果，该村农民们又自动地献出了铁路器材共七十多公斤。十一月一日，该项铁路器材由冯、梁两人用小手车推着送到岱岳车站公安分所，然后请他们转交岱岳工务段材料厂。以上这种情形，充分说明新中国农民觉悟的提高。

    中共文登地委指示各县委重视群众来信和来访
    山东文登专区各县过去对群众来信的处理是不够严肃认真的，有积压和无人管理的现象。为此，文登地委于最近召开的各县秘书会议上专门研究了这一工作，各地都开始建立了转办、交办、实地调查、负责同志批办、留底、存档、报告等制度。但是仍有些单位对这一工作未认真进行。为此文登地委又指示各县必须认真地检查、总结最近的群众来信、来访工作，报告地委。并指出：工作无论怎样忙，都不能把群众来信、来访和解答群众问题的工作挤掉。我觉得，文登地委这样重视群众工作的作风，是值得提倡的。

    应多组织幻灯和电影队下乡
    山东省文教厅电影队在农村巡回放映，受到群众热烈欢迎。
    有一晚，电影队在莒沂县箕山区张李庄放映，机子一开，全场观众都聚精会神地静静地听着、看着。当他们看到毛主席的镜头时，大家都鼓掌欢迎，并高声招呼：“请毛主席慢点走，我们再认一下！”影片放完，很长时间大家都不散，围着电影队的同志们问长问短。有许多人感激地说：“要不是共产党、毛主席和人民政府对咱们关心，咱这山沟子的人几十辈子也看不着电影。”
    我觉得应多组织幻灯、电影队下乡进行宣传。

    在火车上押解犯人的警卫人员应该提高警惕防止跳车事故
    自人民日报在今年一月十五日刊登了我队要求禁止旅客跳车的来信后，确有显著成效。以我队所护车次来说，一月至八月共发生跳车六十三起，死伤率比去年降低百分之八十八强。但押解犯人的警卫人员仍有不与乘警联系以及麻痹大意的现象。如八月十八日京长线一○六次车，有山西省省矿区公安队纪景波等二人押送犯人两名，因打盹，致火车行至大营站信号外时，一犯跳车逃逸（现逃犯已捕获）。又一次，当犯人要大便时，他们将其手铐解开。这些事实，证明他们的麻痹程度已至极点。类此不负责任的情况，在六十三件中即有十五件之多。我认为，应该把这件事提出来，以引起大家注意。
