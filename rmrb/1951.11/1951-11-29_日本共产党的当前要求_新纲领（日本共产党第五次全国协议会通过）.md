    I. How Does the American Occupation Cause
        Suffering for the Japanese People?

    The impoverished state of the Japanese people today is unprecedented in Japanese history. War and defeat have bankrupted the nation. After the war, Japan became a slave of American imperialism, losing its freedom and independence, and losing basic human rights. Now, our entire lives—industry, agriculture, commerce, culture, etc.—are controlled by the American occupation authorities.

    Moreover, American imperialists not only bring us oppression and enslavement, they also exploit the Japanese people through the occupation system, extracting profits from our country. To this end, they have seized all rights to control and plan our industry, agriculture, commerce, and entire lives to suit their own interests.

    In order to destroy Japanese industry, they prevent the development of peaceful Japanese industries, bankrupt Japanese entrepreneurs, and increase unemployment.

    In order to highly exploit the Japanese people, they implement forced labor for war purposes, forcibly requisition agricultural products at the lowest prices, burden the people with heavy taxes, and force Japan to buy American goods at high prices, while they buy Japanese goods at only half the international market price.

    In order to deprive Japan of its last chance to sustain itself through foreign trade, they prohibit trade between Japan and China, and they seize Japan's trade, finance, and industry.

    In Japan, there are more than ten million unemployed or underemployed. Workers' wages are slave wages, insufficient to maintain a minimum standard of living. In factories, an exhausting and unbearable labor system dominates.

    In rural areas, almost all of the farmers' rice, including some of their own rations, has been forcibly requisitioned. Farmers are under the pressure of heavy taxes, and in order to pay these heavy taxes, they are forced to sell their land, even their children.

    Intellectuals are deprived of the freedom to conduct scientific work, and intellectual laborers are turned into "lackeys" of American capitalists.

    Women and girls are forced into prostitution.

    Not only that, but American imperialists are also trying to lure Japan into new wars of aggression in order to completely destroy our country. The main goal of American imperialists in the Far East is to establish their rule in Asia. But American imperialists cannot establish their rule in Asia by relying solely on their own strength. The fact that the United States cannot solve a relatively small country like Korea with its own strength demonstrates this. In order to rule Asia, American imperialism needs a country as a base, a country with military cadres, developed industry, and a population sufficient to send troops. American imperialists believe that Japan is such a country. Therefore, they are trying to drag Japan into a new war of aggression to act as their accomplice.

    That is why they are promoting a separate peace treaty between Japan and the United States, knowing full well that such a separate peace treaty could lead to war against China and the Soviet Union. That is why they are promoting the theory of territorial aggression by German fascists, a theory that has been overturned by history. They say that Japan has a large agricultural population, insufficient land, and a lack of resources, so it must expand its territory. For this expansion, it must wage war and must ally itself with the United States to oppose China and the Soviet Union.

    But these gentlemen are deceiving the farmers. The reason why Japanese farmers lack land now is that the best land is in the hands of landlords and other large landowners. In order for farmers to have enough land, there is no need to wage a new war that is dangerous to Japan. As long as the land of landlords and other large landowners is confiscated and distributed to the farmers without compensation, the farmers will have enough land. Not only that, but there will be spare land left over.

    From this, it can be seen that American imperialists want to drag Japan into a new war of aggression and use Japanese hands and blood to establish their rule in Asia.

    But Japan has already tried this path, the path of aggressive wars to invade other countries' territories. The past war was conducted in alliance with Nazi Germany, and the result of that war was defeat. Our country went bankrupt. Moreover, China was weak at that time, but China is strong now, and the Soviet Union is even stronger than before. What guarantee is there that an alliance with American imperialists will lead to victory? Are Americans better soldiers than Germans?

    Furthermore, who doesn't know that Americans do not treat their allies as equals, but as hired servants. American imperialists control and plunder allies like Britain, leaving them in a state of suspended animation. Let's not even talk about Italy, an ally of the United States, which Americans consider to be an inferior race. What guarantee is there that Japan, acting as an ally of the United States, will not be in an even worse situation?

    What Japan needs is not a new path of war, but a path of peace, a path of cooperation with peace-loving countries, especially China and the Soviet Union. The path of war is the path to Japan's demise, the path to the destruction of Japan's freedom and independence. Only on the path of peace and cooperation with other countries, on the path of free development of industry and agriculture, and free development of domestic and foreign trade, can Japan achieve freedom and independence, economic prosperity, and cultural flourishing. After the occupation system is abolished and Japan cooperates with other countries, Japan will be able to obtain everything it needs for economic prosperity, markets for selling its goods, industrial raw materials, food, etc.

    II. The Yoshida Government is the Spiritual and Political Pillar of the American Occupation System

    However, as long as the Yoshida government exists in Japan, Japan cannot be liberated from American occupation, from enslavement and oppression. Because all the oppressive and plundering orders of the occupation authorities are implemented through the decrees of the Japanese government and the laws of the Japanese Diet. Because the Yoshida government and the Diet are elected, seemingly representing the will of the Japanese people, the illusion is created that the occupation authorities are implementing their oppressive and plundering orders with the consent and approval of the Japanese people.

    The Yoshida government is a curtain concealing the oppressive and exploitative face of the occupation authorities.

    The occupation authorities need such a curtain, because without it, it is difficult to rule Japan. If the occupation authorities acted directly and openly, without hiding behind the scenes, then their orders regarding heavy taxes and forced grain requisitioning would certainly arouse the anger of the Japanese people, and the occupation authorities would be forced to alleviate them or forced to cancel these orders. But because the orders of the occupation authorities are expressed through the decrees and laws of the Yoshida government, the spiritual and political responsibility for issuing these orders is removed from the American authorities, and this responsibility falls on the Japanese government, the Japanese Diet, and ultimately on the Japanese people who elect the government and the Diet. It is clear that this situation greatly facilitates the position of the occupation authorities, allowing them to "rest assured" in continuing their rule in our country.

    The Yoshida government is the spiritual and political pillar of the American occupation authorities in Japan.

    Of course, if another government, a national liberation democratic government unwilling to act as a curtain and pillar for foreign oppressors, were in power in Japan, then the occupation authorities would be in difficulty and would be forced to shorten their occupation time in Japan. But in Japan, there is an anti-national, reactionary Yoshida government willing to act as a curtain and pillar for foreign oppressors, so the occupation authorities still feel good in Japan and are prepared to extend their occupation indefinitely.

    When we say the Yoshida government, we are not referring to Yoshida personally, of course the problem is not with the individual. Today, the reactionary Liberal Party elected Yoshida as Prime Minister, and tomorrow they can select another person from the same reactionary Liberal Party camp. In this way, the situation does not change. We say the Yoshida government refers to the anti-national reactionary forces in Japan that support the reactionary "Liberal" Party and the Yoshida government. These forces are the Japanese Emperor, the old reactionary military clique, privileged bureaucrats, landlords, and monopoly capitalists, those who exploit and encourage the exploitation of the Japanese people. The Yoshida government is the representative of the interests of these reactionary forces.

    The characteristic of the current situation in Japan is that the interests of these reactionary forces in Japan not only do not contradict the interests of the American occupiers, but on the contrary, coincide with them. It is precisely because their interests coincide with the interests of the American occupiers that the Yoshida government agrees to act as a curtain and pillar for the American occupiers.

    Not only is it beneficial for the American occupiers to extend the occupation time, but the Japanese reactionary forces and the Yoshida government are equally willing to do so. Because these reactionary forces believe that the occupation system is the best tool for ruling the Japanese people. Therefore, the Yoshida government is a government of American imperialist oppression of Japan, a government of national enslavement.

    Not only is it beneficial for the American occupiers to lure Japan into a new war, but the Japanese reactionary forces leading the Yoshida government are equally willing to do so. Because they believe that war is the best way for landlords, monopoly capitalists, and privileged bureaucrats to get rich. Therefore, the Yoshida government is a government of war, a government that destroys Japan.

    Therefore, it is a great mistake to think that allowing the "Liberal" Party's reactionary Yoshida government to exist will enable Japan to abolish the occupation system and achieve national liberation. In order to abolish the occupation system, it is necessary to first abolish its spiritual and political pillar, to abolish the Yoshida government. This is the first decisive step on the road to Japan's liberation from the occupation system.

    In order to achieve Japan's national liberation, it is necessary to first overthrow the reactionary "Liberal" Party's Yoshida government and replace it with a new national government.

    This will be a government of Japanese national liberation.

    This will be a government of Japanese democratic reform.

    This will be a government of peace, a government that maintains peaceful relations with the people of other countries.

    This will be a coalition government, representing the interests of all progressive and liberating forces in Japan.

    III. National Liberation Democratic Revolution is Inevitable

    From this, it can be seen that the Japanese people cannot live a human life and breathe freely under the existing reactionary system. This means that the existing reactionary system must be abolished and replaced by a new national democratic system.

    Therefore, Japan needs serious revolutionary reforms.

    The Japanese Communist Party demands that the new national liberation democratic government, which replaces the current reactionary "Liberal" Party government, implement the following changes and reforms in Japan's foreign and domestic policies, and fix them through legislative procedures.

        Foreign Policy

    I. Implement a comprehensive peace treaty based on the Potsdam Proclamation to ensure Japan's national independence and sovereignty.

    II. Abolish the occupation system in Japan and promptly withdraw all occupation forces from Japan.

    III. Establish peaceful relations and free cooperation in economic and trade with all other countries, especially those that advocate peace.

    IV. Uphold peace and prohibit war propaganda.

        National System

    V. Abolish the Emperor system and establish a democratic republic.

    The Emperor system dragged Japan into World War II, resulting in Japan's defeat. The Emperor system is now attempting to lure Japan into a new war that would be even more destructive than the last war. The Japanese people will only benefit from being liberated from the Emperor system.

    The President should be the head of the Japanese state, freely elected by the Japanese people, with elections held every four years.

    VI. Implement a unicameral Diet, with voters having the right to recall members of parliament.

    VII. All male and female citizens over the age of eighteen, regardless of residence, property, or ethnicity, shall enjoy the right to vote and stand for election. Implement a proportional representation system with the entire country as one constituency.

    VIII. Establish a truly democratic local system.

    IX. Guarantee freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, strikes, demonstrations, and belief.

    X. Guarantee the free development of peaceful industries, freedom of enterprise, and exemption from unfair taxation for entrepreneurs and merchants.

    XI. Implement progressive income tax.

    XII. Abolish racial and ethnic discrimination.

    XIII. Implement compulsory education up to the age of sixteen, with all educational expenses borne by the state.

    XIV. The state shall provide assistance to war victims, demobilized soldiers, returning personnel, war veterans, orphans, and families of those who died in the war.

        Farmer Problems

    XV. Confiscate all land from landlords, the Imperial Family, and other large landowners, and distribute it to farmers without compensation.

    The "land reform" announced by the occupation authorities is a land reform that benefits the wealthy, because it does not distribute land to farmers without compensation, but requires farmers to pay for the purchase of land. This "land reform" will certainly not give anything to the majority of farmers who do not have the money to buy land. The mistake of the "Socialist Party" is that they conceal this serious defect of the "land reform" and continue to praise it. What the farmers demand is not a false "land reform," but a real revolutionary land reform, giving all landlord land to the farmers without compensation, including not only cultivated land, but also all mountain forests, pastures, and wasteland. Only such a land reform can satisfy the farmers and enable them to stand up.

    XVI. Provide farmers with water conservancy and the right to use water conservancy facilities without compensation.

    XVII. Establish new water conservancy facilities on a scientific basis to meet the needs of farmers.

    XVIII. The government shall assist farmers in reclaiming wasteland.

    XIX. Provide farmers with low-interest, long-term loans to purchase agricultural implements and build agricultural facilities.

    XX. Reduce taxes for poor farmers and cancel their tax arrears.

    XXI. Cancel the debts owed by poor farmers and fishermen who cannot repay high-interest lenders, banks, and the state.

    XXII. Abolish forced cultivation and forced grain requisitioning. Abolish the prices in the grain requisitioning that bankrupt agriculture, stipulate reasonable prices that allow farmers to continue production, and establish independent agricultural cooperative organizations.

    XXIII. Abolish semi-feudal fishing rights and transfer fishing rights to independent fishermen's groups.

    XXIV. Provide fishermen with fishing tools, materials, and low-interest loans. Abolish the commission system that exploits fishermen.

    XXV. Implement all laws concerning workers among agricultural workers and fishery workers.

        Worker Problems

    XXVI. Stipulate the minimum wage for workers and staff. Equal pay for equal work, without distinction of gender or ethnicity.

    XXVII. Implement an eight-hour workday for all workers. A six-hour workday for underground labor.

    XXVIII. Stipulate a four-shift system for seamen.

    XXIX. Workers shall have no less than two weeks of vacation per year, with full pay.

    XXX. Implement social insurance for loss of labor power and unemployment, with expenses borne by the state and capitalists.

    XXXI. Abolish semi-feudal exploitation systems (prison barrack system, forced boarding system, contracting system, apprenticeship system, recruiting agent system). Prohibit women and adolescents from engaging in heavy labor and harmful or dangerous labor.

    XXXII. Guarantee the free development of trade unions and guarantee the right of trade unions to sign collective contracts with business owners.

    These are the current demands advocated by the Japanese Communist Party. Implementing these demands will liberate the Japanese people from enslavement and poverty.

    IV. The Revolutionary Force – National Liberation
        Democratic United Front

    It would be a serious mistake to assume that the new national liberation democratic government will arise naturally, peacefully, and without obstacles, or that the reactionary Yoshida government will voluntarily step down and hand over its position to the new democratic government without struggle. Such an assumption is fundamentally wrong. On the contrary, the Yoshida government will fight with all its strength to maintain power in its own hands, to maintain the occupation system, and to keep the people in a state of eternal slavery. To this end, it has the police, the army, the help of the occupation authorities, the help of the landlord large monopoly capitalists, and finally the help of the Emperor and his court. Everyone knows that the Yoshida government is already fighting against the Japanese people, driving the Japanese Communist Party underground, arresting labor and peasant leaders, and undermining labor and peasant organizations from within.

    Even if the Yoshida government does not win a majority in the Diet elections, the situation will not improve. Even if the Yoshida government is replaced by another reactionary government that implements Yoshida's policies, everything will remain the same.

    It is wrong to think that Japan's liberation and democratic reforms can be achieved by peaceful means.

    In order to fundamentally improve the lives of workers and peasants, in order to liberate Japan from enslavement, and to relieve the poverty of the Japanese people, it is necessary to organize the serious revolutionary struggle of the people against the reactionary forces in Japan, against the reactionary Yoshida government. Therefore, it is necessary to overthrow the reactionary Yoshida government, clear the road for the new national liberation democratic government, and prepare the conditions for abolishing the occupation system.

    There is no other way.

    The main forces in this liberation struggle are the workers and peasants, who are the vast majority of the Japanese people, and the alliance of workers and peasants. This alliance is an invincible national force. Workers will help their allies, the peasants, to carry out the struggle for land. Peasants will help their allies, the workers, to carry out the struggle for fundamentally improving the living conditions of the working class. This will be the union of the main forces in the city and the countryside, and the union of these forces in common struggle will determine the fate of the Yoshida government and the occupation system.

    The classes that need to unite against the reactionary forces are not only the workers and peasants. Artisans and small merchants, who are oppressed by the occupation system and the reactionary laws of the Yoshida government, will join the worker-peasant alliance. Moreover, small and medium-sized business owners and many entrepreneurs, even large merchants, who are also harmed by the occupation system and the reactionary laws of the Yoshida government, will also join this alliance. All progressive forces in Japan, regardless of their social status, all more or less progressive political parties, and all progressive intellectuals, will join the worker-peasant alliance, because they want to see a free and independent Japan, a Japan with an independent economy, politics, and cultural life.

    This will be the national liberation democratic united front of all progressive forces fighting for the freedom and prosperity of a democratic Japan.

    The Japanese Communist Party considers it an urgent task to strengthen and develop such a united front.

    The Japanese Communist Party calls on all progressive forces in Japan, especially the workers and peasants, to immediately strengthen and develop the national liberation democratic united front.

    日本共产党的当前要求——新纲领
    （日本共产党第五次全国协议会通过）
    一、美国的占领怎样使日本人
        遭受痛苦？
    日本国民现在所处的贫苦地位，是日本历史上从来没有过的。战争与失败使国民破产了。在战后，日本变成美帝国主义者的奴隶，丧失了自由和独立，丧失了基本的人权。现在，我们整个生活——工业、农业、商业、文化等，都为美国占领当局所控制。
    而且，美帝国主义者不仅带给我们以压迫和奴役，他们还利用占领制度剥削日本国民，从我国榨取利润。为此目的，他们夺取了一切控制和策划我们的工业、农业、商业、和整个生活的权利，以便适合他们自己的利益。
    为了摧毁日本的工业，他们阻止日本和平工业的发展，使日本的企业家破产，失业者增加。
    为了高度地剥削日本国民，他们实行以战争为目的的强迫劳动，用最低价格强征农产品，使国民负担重税，并强迫日本用高价购买美国商品，而他们购买日本商品的价格，则仅值国际市场价格的一半。
    为了剥夺日本从对外贸易维持其本身生存的最后机会，他们禁止日本和中国贸易，他们夺取了日本的贸易、金融和工业。
    在日本，失业与半失业者达一千万人以上。工人的工资，是奴隶的工资，不够维持最低限度的生活水平。在工厂里，使人精疲力竭的不堪忍受的劳动制度占着统治地位。
    在农村中，经过强迫征购，强夺了农民的几乎全部大米，包括一部分农民自己的口粮。农民处在重税的压迫之下，为了缴纳繁重的捐税，不得不被迫出卖自己的土地，甚至自己的儿女。
    知识分子被剥夺了进行科学工作的自由，使智力劳动者变为美国财主的“走卒”。
    妇女和少女被迫卖淫。
    不仅如此，美帝国主义者还企图吸引日本参加新的侵略战争，以便完全摧毁我们的国家。美帝国主义者在远东的主要目的，是要建立其在亚洲的统治。但是美帝国主义者仅仅依靠自己的力量，是不能确立其在亚洲的统治的。美国不能用自己的力量，来解决像朝鲜这样一个比较不大的国家这一事实，就表明了这点。美帝国主义为了统治亚洲，需要一个国家作为基地，这个国家要有军事干部、发达的工业、和足够出兵的人口。美帝国主义者认为日本就是这样的国家。因此他们企图把日本拖入新的侵略战争，来充当自己的帮手。
    正因为如此，他们宣传日本与美国单独媾和，他们清楚知道这种单独媾和可以引向对中、苏的战争。正因为如此，他们宣传已经被历史推翻了的德国法西斯侵略他国领土的理论。他们说，日本农业人口很多，土地不足，资源缺乏，因此必须扩张版图，为了这个扩张，必须进行战争，必须和美国联盟，来反对中国和苏联。
    但是这些先生们是在欺骗农民。现在日本的农民缺少土地，是由于最好的土地都在地主和其他大土地所有主的手中。为了使农民有足够的土地，根本不需要进行对日本危险的流血的新的战争，只要没收地主与其他大土地所有主的土地，无代价地分给农民，这样农民就有足够的土地了。不仅如此，还会剩出预备的土地来。
    由此可见，美帝国主义者想把日本拖入新的侵略战争，用日本人的手和血来建立其在亚洲的统治。
    但是这条道路，即侵略他国领土的侵略战争的道路，日本是试用过了的。过去的战争是在与纳粹德国的同盟下进行的，这个战争的结果是失败了。我们国家破产了。何况当时中国是弱的，现在中国是强的，而苏联现在比过去更强。有什么保证，和美帝国主义者的同盟会取得胜利呢？难道美国人比德国人是更好的战士吗？
    此外，谁不知道，美国人不是以平等的态度对待同盟者，而是以对待被雇佣者的态度对待它的。美帝国主义者对待英国这样的同盟者，是挟制它，掠夺它，使它不生不死。我们不再去说美国同盟者的意大利，美国人认为意大利是低等民族。有什么保证日本充当美国同盟者不处于更坏的境遇呢？
    日本需要的不是新的战争道路，而是和平的道路，与爱好和平的国家，首先是和中国、苏联合作的道路。战争的道路对于日本是灭亡，是毁灭日本自由和独立的道路。只有在和其他国家和平、合作的道路上，在自由发展工业、农业，自由发展对内、对外贸易的道路上，日本才能取得自由和独立，经济繁荣和文化昌盛。取消占领制度，和其他国家合作后，日本能够获得为了经济繁荣所需要的一切东西，为销售自己商品的市场、工业原料、食粮等等。
    二、吉田政府是美国占领制度
        的精神的、政治的支柱
    但是，只要在日本存在着吉田政府，日本便不可能从美国占领下解放出来，从奴役和压迫下解放出来。因为占领当局的一切压迫的、掠夺的命令，都是经过日本政府的法令和日本国会的法律形式来实现的。因为吉田政府和国会是选举出来的，好像是代表日本国民的意志，因此就产生了这样的假象，好像占领当局实行其压迫和掠夺的命令时，是取得了日本国民的同意和批准的。
    吉田政府是掩盖占领当局的压迫、剥削面目的幕布。
    占领当局需要这样的幕布，因为没有它是难于统治日本的。假如占领当局直接地、公开地行动，而不藏在幕后，那么它关于重税和强征粮食等等的命令，一定会引起日本国民的忿怒，占领当局会被迫来减轻它们，或被迫来取消这些命令。但是，因为占领当局的命令是经过吉田政府的法令和法律形式表现出来的，因此便把颁布这些命令的精神的、政治的责任，从美国当局的身上解除出来，而这个责任便落到日本政府、日本国会身上，最后会落到选举政府和国会的日本国民身上。由此可见，这种情况根本便利了占领当局的处境，而使它能够“安心”地继续在我国的统治。
    吉田政府是美国占领当局在日本的精神上、政治上的支柱。
    当然，假如在日本掌握政权的是另一个政府，是一个不愿充当外国压迫者幕布和支柱的民族解放民主政府，那么，占领当局就会陷于困难，会被迫缩短其在日本的占领时间。但在日本是一个反民族的、反动的、愿意充当外国压迫者的幕布和支柱的吉田政府，因此占领当局在日本还感觉得不坏，并准备无限期地延长自己的占领。
    当我们说吉田政府时，并不是指吉田个人，当然问题不在于个人。今天反动的自由党推选了吉田当首相，明天他们可以从同一反动的自由党营垒提选出另外一个人。这样，情况并没有改变。我们说吉田政府是指拥护反动的“自由”党和吉田政府的日本反民族的反动势力。这些势力是日本天皇、旧的反动军阀、特权官僚、地主和垄断资本家，是那些剥削和鼓励剥削日本国民的那些人，吉田政府是这些反动势力的利益的代表者。
    日本现在形势的特点是：日本这些反动势力的利益，和美国占领者的利益不但不矛盾，相反的是相吻合的。正因为他们的利益和美国占领者的利益相符合，所以吉田政府同意充当美国占领者的幕布和支柱。
    不仅延长占领时间有利于美国占领者，日本反动势力，吉田政府也同样愿意如此。因为这些反动势力认为，占领制度是统治日本国民的最好工具。因此吉田政府是美帝国主义者压迫日本的、民族奴役的政府。
    不仅吸引日本加入新的战争有利于美国占领者，同样的，领导吉田政府的日本反动势力也同样愿意如此。因为他们认为，战争是使地主、垄断资本家、特权官僚发财的最好的办法。因此吉田政府是战争的政府，使日本毁灭的政府。
    因此，假如认为让“自由”党的、反动吉田政府存在，而能使日本取消占领制度，取得民族解放，那是绝大错误。为要取消占领制度，必须首先取消其精神上、政治上的支柱，取消吉田政府。这就是日本从占领制度下解放出来的道路上的第一个决定性的步骤。
    为要达到日本民族的解放，必须首先打倒反动的“自由”党的吉田政府，代之以新的国民政府。
    这将是日本民族解放的政府。
    这将是日本民主改革的政府。
    这将是和平的政府，和其他各国人民维持和平关系的政府。
    这将是联合政府，代表日本一切进步解放势力的利益的政府。
    三、民族解放民主革命不可避免
    由此可见，日本国民在现存的反动制度下，不能过人的生活和自由呼吸。这就是说，必须废除现存的反动制度，代之以新的民族民主制度。
    因此，日本需要严重的革命改革。
    日本共产党要求，代替现在反动的“自由”党政府的新的民族解放民主政府，实行关于日本对外对内政策中下列改变和改革，并以立法程序固定之。
        对外政策
    一、根据波茨坦公告实行全面媾和，以保证日本的民族独立和主权。
    二、取消在日本的占领制度，从速由日本撤退一切占领军。
    三、和一切其他国家，首先是赞成和平的国家建立和平关系和经济的、贸易的自由合作。
    四、拥护和平和禁止战争宣传。
        国家制度
    五、取消天皇制，建立民主共和国。
    天皇制度使日本卷入第二次世界战争，结果日本被打败。天皇制现在又企图吸引日本加入比上次战争更要毁灭日本的新战争。日本国民从天皇制度下解放出来只会得到利益。
    以总统为日本国家元首，由日本国民自由选举，每四年改选一次。
    六、实行一院制国会，选举人有权罢免议员。
    七、凡十八岁以上的男女公民，不受居住、财产及民族的限制，一律享有选举权和被选举权。实施以全国为一个选区的比例代表制。
    八、建立真正民主主义的地方制度。
    九、保证言论、出版、集会、结社、罢工、示威游行、信仰的自由。
    十、保证和平工业的自由发展，企业的自由，免除对企业家和商人的不公平的课税。
    十一、实行累进所得税。
    十二、取消种族及民族歧视。
    十三、实行至十六岁的义务教育，由国家负担全部教育费。
    十四、由国家出资帮助战争受难者、复员军人、归国人员、战争中的残废者、孤儿和战争中死难者的家属。
        农民问题
    十五、没收一切地主、皇室和其他大土地所有主的土地，无代价地分给农民。
    占领当局所宣布的“土地改革”是有利于富裕的人的土地改革，因为它不是无代价地分土地给农民，而是要农民出钱购买。这种“土地改革”当然不能给大多数没有钱来购买土地的农民以什么东西。“社会党”的错误是在他们隐蔽“土地改革”的这个严重缺点，并且继续歌颂它。农民所要求的，不是虚伪的“土地改革”，而是需要真正的革命的土地改革，无代价地给农民以全部地主土地，不仅包括耕地，而且包括全部山林地、牧地、荒地。只有这样的土地改革可以满足农民，而使农民能够站立起来。
    十六、无代价供给农民以水利，及使用水利设备的权利。
    十七、在科学的基础上建立新的水利设备，以满足农民的需要。
    十八、由政府帮助农民开垦荒地。
    十九、给农民以低利的长期贷款，以便购买农具和建筑农业上的设备。
    二十、减轻贫苦农民的捐税，取消他们的捐税尾欠。
    二十一、取消还不起债的贫农及渔民所欠高利贷者、银行及国家的债务。
    二十二、取消强迫耕种及强迫征粮。取消征购粮食中的使农业破产的价格，规定使农民能继续生产的合理价格，建立独立的农业合作组织。
    二十三、取消半封建的渔业权，把渔权交给独立的渔民团体。
    二十四、供给渔民以渔业工具，材料及低利贷款。取消剥削渔民的佣金制度。
    二十五、把全部关于工人的法律在农业工人、渔业工人中实行。
        工人问题
    二十六、规定工人和职员的最低工资。同工同酬，无性别、民族的区别。
    二十七、实行一切工人八小时工作制。坑内劳动六小时制。
    二十八、规定海员四班制。
    二十九、工人每年应有不少于二星期的休假，工资照给。
    三十、实行丧失劳动力与失业的社会保险，其经费由国家及资本家负担。
    三十一、取消半封建的剥削制度（监狱号房制度，强制寄宿制度，包工制度，徒弟制度，招募人制度）。禁止妇女及青少年参加重劳动，及有害的、危险的劳动。
    三十二、保证工会的自由发展，保证工会与企业主签订集体合同的权利。
    这些就是日本共产党所主张的当前要求，实行这些要求，会把日本国民从奴役和贫困下解放出来。
    四、革命的力量——民族解放
        民主统一战线
    假如设想新的民族解放民主政府会自然产生，会没有阻碍地和平地产生，或者反动吉田政府会自愿地离职，不经过斗争会把自己的位置让给新的民主政府，那是严重的错误。这样设想是根本错误的。相反的，吉田政府会以一切力量来斗争以保持政权在自己手中，以保持占领制度，使国民永远处于奴隶状态。为此目的，它有警察，军队，占领当局的帮助，地主大垄断资本家的帮助，最后还有天皇及其宫廷的帮助。大家知道，吉田政府已经在进行斗争反对日本国民，把日本共产党赶入地下，逮捕工农的领袖，从内部破坏工农的组织。
    即使在国会的选举中吉田政府得不到多数，情况也不会变好。甚至即使以另一个执行吉田政策的反动政府来代替吉田政府，一切也还是照旧。
    认为用和平的手段能够求得日本的解放与民主改革是错误的。
    为要根本改善工农生活，为要从奴役下解放日本，解除日本国民的贫困，必须组织国民的严重的革命斗争来反对日本的反动势力，来反对反动的吉田政府。因此，必须打倒反动的吉田政府，为新的民族解放民主政府肃清道路，为取消占领制度准备条件。
    别的道路是没有的。
    这个解放斗争中的主要力量是工人、农民，他们是日本国民的绝大多数，是工人和农民的联盟。这个联盟是不可战胜的国民的力量。工人将帮助自己的同盟者——农民来进行要求土地的斗争。农民将帮助自己的同盟者——工人来进行为根本改善工人阶级的生活条件的斗争。这将是城市与农村主要力量的联合，这些力量在共同斗争中联合起来将决定吉田政府和占领制度的命运。
    需要联合起来反对反动势力的阶级不仅是工人与农民。受占领制度及吉田政府反动法律压迫的手工业者和小商人，会参加工农联盟。而且，参加这个联盟的还有中小企业主和很多企业主，甚至大商人，他们同样受到占领制度和吉田政府反动法律的害处。参加工农联盟的会有日本的一切进步力量，不管其社会地位如何，一切多少进步的政党和全部进步知识分子，因为他们想见到自由的独立的日本，见到有独立的经济、政治、文化生活的日本。
    这将是为民主日本的自由和繁荣而斗争的、一切进步力量的民族解放民主统一战线。
    日本共产党认为加强和发展这样的一个统一战线是紧急的任务。
    日本共产党号召日本一切进步势力，首先是工人、农民，立即加强和发展民族解放民主统一战线。
