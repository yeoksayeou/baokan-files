    Wu'an County and Zhengding County
    Enemy Characters Still Appear in Some Yangko Teams; Should Be Corrected Immediately
    To the Editor: On October 8th, I saw the Yangko team of the 14th Street in Dongguan, Wu'an County, Hebei Province, doing costumed propaganda. Among them, one Yangko member was wearing a tall hat and dressed as an American devil, and another Yangko member was wearing a steel helmet and dressed as a Japanese devil, but both were wearing the uniforms of the People's Liberation Army. They walked at the front of the Yangko team, twisting in the same rhythm as workers, peasants, students, and women. At that time, the audience was discussing this, believing that this phenomenon of not distinguishing between the enemy and us was wrong. I think it should be corrected immediately.
    Hao Zhinan, *Huabei Jiefangjun Bao She* (North China People's Liberation Army Newspaper)
    To the Editor: When people from all walks of life in Zhengding County, Hebei Province, held a National Day celebration, figures like Truman and MacArthur even appeared in the Yangko team of the Construction Institute. Although they were dressed very ugly, how can we allow the evil enemies to be in the ranks, dancing and singing with the people, when celebrating National Day? I hope that the comrades leading the Yangko team should pay attention to the ideological nature of propaganda work and not let this phenomenon happen again.
    Zhang Zengshou, Zhengding Normal School, Hebei

    Editor's Note: Regarding the opinion that there should be no enemy characters in the Yangko team, a reader of this newspaper had already criticized it on February 18th (see the "People's Literature and Art" special issue of this newspaper that day). On April 22nd, this newspaper pointed out in more detail in response to another reader's letter on the same issue: Yangko plays can express more complex life plots, so there can be enemy characters. Yangko dance and Yangko teams express the collective emotions of the masses. If there are enemy characters, it is easy to create the impression among the audience that the enemy is indistinguishable from us and that we are enjoying ourselves with the enemy. Therefore, it is not appropriate to play enemy characters in Yangko dances and Yangko teams. However, these criticisms and opinions have not yet attracted widespread attention. The letters from readers Hao Zhinan and Zhang Zengshou, published here, raise this opinion again, which should attract the attention of the Yangko team of the 14th Street in Wu'an County, the Yangko team of Zhengding Construction Institute, and other Yangko teams with similar situations.

### 武安县和正定县  某些秧歌队中还有敌人角色出现，应迅速纠正

    武安县和正定县
    某些秧歌队中还有敌人角色出现，应迅速纠正
    编辑同志：十月八日，我在河北武安县东关看见该县第十四街的秧歌队作化装宣传。其中有一个秧歌队员戴着高帽子，化装成美国鬼子，一个秧歌队员戴着钢盔，化装成日本鬼子，两人穿的却都是人民解放军的服装。他们走在秧歌队的最前面，与工人、农民、学生、妇女等扭着同一的步法。当时观众都议论纷纷，认为这种敌我不分的现象是不对的，我以为应该迅速纠正。
    华北解放军报社    郝指南
    编辑同志：河北正定县各界人民举行庆祝国庆大会时，在建设学院的秧歌队里，竟出现了杜鲁门、麦克阿瑟之流的人物。他们虽然装扮得十分丑恶，但在庆祝国庆的时候，怎么能让万恶的敌人夹在队伍里，与人民一起歌舞呢？我希望领导秧歌队的同志应注意宣传工作的思想性，不要再发生这种现象。
    河北正定师范    张增寿
    编者按：关于秧歌队中不应有敌人角色的意见，本报读者早在二月十八日就已提出批评（见该日本报“人民文艺”专刊），四月二十二日本报在答复另一读者对于同一问题的来信中更详细地指出：秧歌剧可以表现较复杂的生活情节，因此，可以有敌人角色。秧歌舞和秧歌队是表现群众集体的情绪，如有敌人角色，容易在观众中产生敌我不分与敌我同乐的印象，因此，在秧歌舞和秧歌队中不宜扮演敌人的角色。但这些批评和意见还未引起普遍的注意。这里发表的读者郝指南、张增寿的来信，再度提出了这个意见，应引起武安县第十四街秧歌队、正定建设学院秧歌队和其他有类似情形的秧歌队的注意。
