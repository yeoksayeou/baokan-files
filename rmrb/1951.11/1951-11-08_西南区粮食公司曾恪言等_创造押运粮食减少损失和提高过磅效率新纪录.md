To the Editor:
Comrades Zeng Keyan and He Wancan, grain escorts of the Southwest District Grain Company, and Comrade Chen Juyi and others, weighers of the Dongjiaxi Central Warehouse in Chongqing, have created new records in reducing losses and improving weighing efficiency in grain escort in the patriotic labor emulation drive. In the first half of this year, Zeng Keyan escorted four batches of grain ships (a total of 7,530,000 catties) from Hejiang and Hechuan to Chongqing, with the highest amount of grain escorted in one trip reaching 2,350,000 catties. He Wancan escorted three batches of grain ships (a total of 5,420,000 catties) from Hechuan to Chongqing, with the highest amount of grain escorted in one trip reaching 2,920,000 catties. Together, the two of them escorted a total of 12,950,000 catties of grain. Although they passed through ten famous dangerous shoals during the escort, due to their high enthusiasm for protecting national property and scientific organization of labor, the grain suffered neither transportation accidents nor natural losses. If calculated according to the accident loss rate of 0.15% in 1950, a loss of 19,425 catties was reduced. If the natural loss is calculated according to the stipulated 0.22% in 1951, a loss of 28,490 catties was reduced. The two items combined reduced a loss of 47,915 catties. They created national records for the amount of grain escorted and the reduction of losses.
In terms of weighing, Chen Juyi only weighed 300,000 to 400,000 catties per day in January this year, which gradually increased to 500,000 catties. Since the launch of the work competition in June, due to his continuous research and new improvements in organization of labor and cooperation, the daily weighing efficiency has increased from 600,000 catties to 700,000 catties. On average, one bag of grain can be weighed every five seconds, which is twice the efficiency of ordinary weighing. Now, this weighing team has won the glorious title of "Chen Juyi Team", and they have also launched a challenge competition to weighers of grain companies across the country.

    西南区粮食公司曾恪言等
    创造押运粮食减少损失和提高过磅效率新纪录
    编辑同志：西南区粮食公司押运员曾恪言、何万灿，和重庆董家溪中心仓库过磅员陈巨义等同志，在爱国主义劳动竞赛中，创造了押运粮食减少损耗和提高过磅效率的新纪录。在今年上半年曾恪言由合江、合川押粮船四批（计共七百五十三万斤）到重庆，其中一次押运粮食最高达二百三十五万斤。何万灿由合川押粮船三批（计共粮食五百四十二万斤）到重庆，其中一次押运粮食最高达二百九十二万斤。两人合起来，共押运粮食一千二百九十五万斤。在押运途中，虽经过十个有名的险滩，但由于他们有着高度的爱护国家财产的热忱，和科学的组织分工，使粮食既无运输事故的损失，又无自然损耗。如按一九五○年因事故的损失率百分之○·一五计算，则减少了一万九千四百二十五斤的损失。自然损耗如按一九五一年规定百分之○·二二计算，则减少了二万八千四百九十斤的损失。两项计共减少损失四万七千九百十五斤。创造了押运数量和减少损失的全国纪录。
    过磅方面，在今年一月，陈巨义每日过磅仅三、四十万斤，后逐渐增至五十万斤。从六月份开展工作竞赛后，由于他不断地钻研，在组织分工和配合方面都有了新的改进，因此，每日过磅效率又由六十万斤增至七十万斤。平均每五秒钟可过粮食一包，较一般的过磅效率增加一倍。现在，这个过磅小组已获得了“陈巨义小组”的光荣称号，他们并已向全国粮食公司过磅员提出了挑战竞赛。
