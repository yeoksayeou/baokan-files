Abuses of Apprentices by Capitalists Occur in Various Places; Relevant Authorities Should Seriously Address Them Immediately

In various locations, incidents of illegal abuse of apprentices by capitalists in privately-owned medium and small factories and shops are continuously occurring. The situation is relatively serious in East China, Southwest China, Northwest China, and North China; fewer cases occur in Northeast China and Central South China; there are fewer cases in large cities than in medium and small cities; there are fewer cases in industry than in commerce, and among commercial sectors, barber shops, shoe stores, and cloth shops have more cases than other industries (of the eight capitalists in Beijing recently sentenced for abusing apprentices, all were from barber shops). The methods of abuse used by illegal capitalists are as follows:

First, brutally beating and scolding workers and apprentices. For example, the small boss of Tiandetang Pharmacy in Hangzhou beat apprentice Zhu Zhengsheng to death; workers Yang Jin弟 of Xinhua Silk Factory in Suzhou and apprentice Wang Dechuan of Qiulin Clothing Store in Chongqing committed suicide by drowning because they could not bear the abuse; incidents of forcing apprentices to death also occurred in Zhixiang Silk Factory in Shanghai, Hengsheng Rice Store in Yidu, Hubei, Chunyuyong Pharmacy in Pengjia Town, Mianyang, and Liu Zhengxing Scale Store in Wuhu.臧平玉, a fifteen-year-old apprentice at Limin Blacksmith Shop in Yinchuan, Ningxia, was beaten forty-six times by the boss within half a year.

Second, illegally restricting the political activities of workers and apprentices. Among the 134 apprentices in the 27th branch of the Suzhou Shop Employees' Union's Food Industry, 80% had not participated in political activities, and 60% had not joined the union. In the manual construction industry of the city, 70% of the apprentices were unable to join the union due to illegal restrictions by capitalists.

Third, extending the working hours of workers and apprentices and illegally engaging in economic exploitation. In medium and small enterprises throughout the country, the working hours of apprentices are generally between ten and fifteen hours. In some stores in Liuzhou, Guangxi, and Kunming, Yunnan, the working hours even reached seventeen or nineteen hours. Economic exploitation of workers and apprentices by capitalists in medium and small enterprises across the country is also very serious. Shi Yongcun, an apprentice at Yongzhai Shoe Store in Tangshan, only received 20,000 yuan in wages and two and a half sets of old cotton-padded and unlined clothes after working for two years. Ding Ruixiang, an employee of Huaxingyong Dye Shop in Xinpu City, Shandong, worked for four years, and Li Peixin worked for seven years. Combined, they only received 2.25 million yuan in wages in eleven years.

The phenomenon of capitalists arbitrarily extending the apprenticeship period and arbitrarily dismissing workers is also very common. In some small shops and enterprises, apprentices have to take care of the boss's children, pour tea, and serve meals in addition to their work, so that apprentices cannot really learn anything.

The reasons for the above events are mainly due to the fact that the various feudal systems existing in medium and small enterprises have not yet been thoroughly reformed. In the past, some localities adopted inappropriately lenient attitudes towards capitalists when dealing with such problems, which further fueled the illegal behavior of some capitalists. For example, some illegal capitalists in Beijing said: "What if we beat them? At most, we will issue a public apology in the newspaper." Some, after being summoned by the court and released on bail, even said: "It doesn't matter to take a look at the court."

Seriously and responsibly handling these incidents and protecting the legitimate rights and interests of workers and apprentices is one of the serious political tasks of local people's governments and mass organizations. (Compiled by this newspaper)

　　各地发生资方虐待学徒事件
    有关机关应即认真加以处理
    各地不断发生私营中、小工厂商店的资方非法虐待学徒的事件。华东、西南、西北、华北等地比较严重，东北、中南较少；大城市比中、小城市少；工业比商业少，而在商业中，理发业、鞋业、布店又较其他行业为多（北京最近判决的八个虐待学徒的资方都是理发业）。不法资方虐待学徒的方式有下列几种：
    第一、残暴的打骂工人、学徒。例如杭州天德堂药店小老板打死了学徒朱正生；苏州新华丝厂工人杨金弟、重庆秋林被服店学徒王德传等因不堪虐待投河自杀；上海志祥绸厂、湖北宜都恒升米店、沔阳彭家镇春育永药店、芜湖刘正兴秤店等亦发生逼死学徒事件。宁夏银川市利民铁匠炉的十五岁学徒臧平玉，半年内即被老板打了四十六次。
    第二、非法限制工人、学徒政治活动。苏州市店员工会食品业第二十七分会一百三十四个学徒中，百分之八十没有参加过政治活动，百分之六十没有参加工会。该市手工建筑业中亦有百分之七十的学徒因受资方非法限制不能参加工会。
    第三、延长工人、学徒工作时间，非法进行经济剥削。各地中、小企业学徒工作时间一般均在十小时至十五小时之间。广西柳州、云南昆明等地个别商店甚至达到十七小时或十九小时。各地中、小企业资方对工人、学徒经济剥削也非常严重。唐山永斋鞋店学徒史永存工作了两年，仅得到了两万元的工资和旧棉衣、夹衣两套半。山东新浦市华兴涌染料店店员丁瑞祥工作了四年，李佩信工作了七年，两人合计，十一年中仅得到了二百二十五万元的工资。
    资方随便延长学徒学习期限随便开除工人等现象也很多。有些小商店、企业中，学徒除了工作外，还得给老板抱孩子、倒茶、端饭，致使学徒也不能真正学到什么东西。
    产生上述事件的原因，主要是由于中、小企业中存在着的各种封建制度还未能彻底改革，过去在处理这类问题时有的地方对资方采取了不适当的宽容态度，更助长了某些资方的不法行为，如北京某些不法资方说：“打了又怎么样，至多来个登报道歉。”有的被法院传讯取保释放后还说：“到法院看看也没关系。”
    认真负责地处理这些事件，保障工人、学徒的合法权利，是各地人民政府和群众团体严重的政治任务之一。（本报综合）
