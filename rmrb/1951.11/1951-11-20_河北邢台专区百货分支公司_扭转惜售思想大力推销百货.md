    Reverses Reluctance to Sell, Vigorously Promotes Department Store Goods
    The Xingtai Special District Department Store Branch Company in Hebei Province has reversed its conservative reluctance to sell and is vigorously promoting department store goods in coordination with the task of purchasing new cotton, achieving great results.

    Xingtai Special District is a cotton-producing area. The Xingtai Department Store Branch Company, in coordination with the task of purchasing new cotton, expanded its business organization and sales scope. As of the end of October, it had established fifteen grassroots teams (including ten mobile teams) in key areas such as Xingtai, Nangong, Wei County, and Ningjin. Employees of each branch company simultaneously launched a business competition. During the competition, salespeople at the Nangong Branch Company's retail department changed their past "official" style and warmly welcomed customers. Cadres at the Ningjin Branch Company overcame the conservative reluctance to sell, fearing that the goods would be sold out, and vigorously promoted goods. Each branch company has begun to pay attention to publicity work. After each branch company received Soviet floral fabric, it posted advertisements on the streets, in theaters, and in rural areas. Some used radio broadcasts from cinemas and cultural centers for extensive publicity. Meng Xian'gao, the business section chief of the Wei County Branch Company, personally participated in experimental sales and quickly sold thirty barrels of the new "Hongyan Vulcanized Green" paint. The Chuiyang team actively contacted vendors and sold fifty bolts of Soviet floral fabric in one day. The Xingtai retail department sent people to the countryside and cooperated with cooperatives and peddlers at temple fairs and market towns to sell goods directly to the masses.

    The Xingtai Branch Company signed key sales contracts and agreements with the Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative and established business relationships with the Shahe and Lincheng Cooperatives. These new agreements and contracts played a significant role in promoting sales.

    In order to change the phenomenon of insufficient supply of industrial products, the Xingtai Branch Company signed processing contracts with public and private factories in the Xingtai Special District in a targeted manner. The Nangong, Xingtai, and Wei County branches organized two hundred and twenty towel-weaving machines for processing and production. The Xingtai Branch Company, through the Industry and Commerce Federation's trade association, organized thirty-six sock-knitting factories for processing and production. This method of directly signing processing contracts not only reduced transportation costs and met the needs of the masses, but also solved the problem of capital turnover difficulties for various factories.

　　河北邢台专区百货分支公司
    扭转惜售思想大力推销百货
    河北省邢台专区百货分支公司，扭转保守惜售思想，配合收购新棉任务全力推销百货，获得很大成绩。
    邢台专区是棉产区。邢台百货分公司配合收购新棉任务，扩大了经营机构和销货范围。截至十月底，已经有重点地在邢台、南宫、威县、宁晋等地建立了十五个基层小组（包括十个流动组）。各分支公司职工，同时展开业务竞赛。在竞赛运动中，南宫支公司门市部售货员转变了过去的“官字号”作风，热情招待顾客。宁晋支公司干部克服了“怕货卖光”的保守惜售思想，大力推销货物。各支公司已开始重视宣传工作。各支公司运到苏联花布后，就在街头、戏院、农村张贴广告，有的利用电影院和文化馆的广播广泛宣传。威县支公司业务股长孟宪高亲自参加试验售货，很快销出新牌“鸿燕硫化青”三十桶。垂阳小组主动联系商贩，一天销出五十匹苏联花布。邢台门市部派人下乡，在庙会与集镇上，和合作社、小贩合作，直接卖货给群众。
    邢台分公司与专区社订立了重点销货合同和协议，并与沙河、临城合作社建立了业务关系。这些新的协议与合同，在推销业务上，发挥了重大的作用。
    为了改变工业品供不应求的现象，邢台分公司有重点的和邢台专区各公私营工厂订立了加工合同。南宫、邢台、威县各支公司，组织了二百二十架织毛巾的机器，进行加工生产。邢台分公司通过工商业联合会行业公会，组织三十六户织袜工厂，进行加工生产。这种直接订立加工合同的办法，不但减低了运费开支，满足了群众的需要，也解决了各厂资金周转不灵的困难。（本报综合）
