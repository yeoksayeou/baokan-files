    To Eliminate All Pretexts for Delaying Negotiations by the US Side and Quickly Establish Basic Armistice Conditions
    I Propose Using the Existing Line of Contact as the Military Demarcation Line
    The US Side Can Offer No Reasons for Opposition; However, They Unreasonably Demanded Control of Part of the Kaesong Area During the Adjustment of the Existing Line of Contact. Our Side Immediately Refused Sternly.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 7th] In order to eliminate all pretexts for delaying the armistice negotiations by the US side, to quickly establish the basic conditions for a Korean armistice, and to seek an early restoration of peace in Korea, our side's representatives formally proposed the following at the subcommittee meeting on November 7th:
    (1) The principle of determining the existing actual line of contact as the military demarcation line, and withdrawing two kilometers from this line on each side to establish a demilitarized zone.
    (2) According to the above principle, the subcommittee should immediately begin to adjust the existing actual line of contact on a 1:250,000 scale map to specifically determine the existing actual line of contact agreed upon by both sides as the military demarcation line, and thereby specifically determine the lines two kilometers from each side of the military demarcation line as the northern and southern edges of the demilitarized zone, demarcating the demilitarized zone; and it is recommended that the following understandings be reached:
    A. When specifically determining the existing actual line of contact as the military demarcation line to establish the demilitarized zone, if one party proposes an adjustment but the other party does not agree, the party proposing the adjustment should immediately abandon its proposed adjustment.
    B. Once the subcommittee has generally determined the location of the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone on the 1:250,000 scale map, the subcommittee will submit the specific plan for the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone agreed upon by both sides to the plenary meeting, and recommend that the plenary meeting immediately enter into discussions of other agenda items, and that the work of specifically demarcating the location of the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone on a 1:50,000 scale map be handled by a committee composed of staff officers from both sides.
    C. In view of the fact that changing the specific location of the military demarcation line according to the minor changes in the actual line of contact each day is clearly impractical, if the armistice negotiations progress rapidly and the actual line of contact does not undergo significant changes before the signing of the armistice agreement, then the military demarcation line and demilitarized zone that have been preliminarily determined by both sides need not be modified further; otherwise, both sides reserve the right to propose corresponding modifications to the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone according to the changes in the actual line of contact before the signing of the armistice agreement.
    Since the resumption of the delegation meetings on October 25th, although the US side has abandoned the arrogant and absurd proposals it made before the resumption of the meetings, it has put forward the unreasonable demand of occupying our Kaesong area, and insisted on opposing our side's specific plan of strictly adhering to the existing actual line of contact for fair and reasonable necessary adjustments. When our side, in order to eliminate all pretexts for delaying negotiations by the other side, proposed a strict cease-fire in place without making any adjustments, the US side put forward the so-called vague and abstract principle of making appropriate adjustments according to the line of contact at the time of the signing of the armistice agreement to determine the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone, attempting to reserve the right to re-propose the unreasonable demand of forcibly occupying our Kaesong area at any time. In order to prevent the resolution of the second agenda item from being perpetually entangled in the unreasonable so-called appropriate adjustments put forward by the US side, our side's representatives specifically suggested at the subcommittee meeting on November 7th to formally determine the existing actual line of contact as the military demarcation line, with both sides withdrawing two kilometers to establish a demilitarized zone, and suggested reaching the first understanding: one party must not insist on any adjustment to which the other party does not agree, so that the armistice negotiations will not be delayed indefinitely due to the other party's insistence on unreasonable demands. At the same time, in order to reach a clear and specific agreement on the second agenda item on the one hand, and to enable the armistice negotiations to proceed rapidly on the other, our side's representatives suggested reaching the second understanding: after the subcommittee has determined the general location of the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone, the delegation plenary meeting will immediately enter into discussions of other agenda items, and a committee composed of staff officers from both sides will demarcate the detailed location of the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone. Regarding the absurd argument put forward by the other side that the agreement on the second agenda item could only be tentative and not final, our side's representatives pointed out that according to the other side's argument, any item on the agenda could be overturned at any time after an agreement is reached, and the negotiations would be delayed endlessly. Therefore, our side's representatives suggested reaching the third understanding: if the armistice negotiations progress rapidly and the actual line of contact does not undergo significant changes before the signing of the armistice agreement, then the military demarcation line and demilitarized zone plan that has been preliminarily determined by both sides need not be modified further. However, in order to eliminate all pretexts for the other side to continue adopting a delaying policy, our side's representatives also agreed that in the opposite case, both sides reserve the right to propose corresponding revisions to the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone. If the US side mistakes our side's sincerity for peace as a sign of weakness, and vainly attempts to use military force to realize its unreasonable demands before the signing of the armistice agreement, history will prove what the fate of warmongers will be. Our side's new proposal is fair and just and cannot be opposed. Whether the US side is sincere in making the Korean armistice negotiations successful, enabling the preliminary wishes of peace-loving people around the world to be realized, and enabling millions of soldiers on the Korean battlefield to return home to live a peaceful life, will be severely tested here.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 8th] At the subcommittee meeting on November 8th, our side's representatives continued to point out: The principle formally proposed by our side on the 7th of strictly determining the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone by withdrawing two kilometers from each side of the existing actual line of contact, as well as the understanding that one party must not insist on any adjustments to which the other party does not agree, is not only completely in line with the principle of fairness and reciprocity, but also avoids entangling the armistice negotiations forever in unreasonable adjustments proposed by one party. The proposal put forward by our side that the subcommittee should first determine the general and specific location of the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone, and leave the detailed location of the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone to be specifically demarcated by the staff officers of both sides, so that the delegation meeting can enter into the discussion of other agenda items, is also completely in line with the provisions of the agenda, so that the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone have clear and specific provisions before the discussion of other agenda items, and at the same time enables the armistice negotiations to proceed rapidly. The understanding put forward by our side that once the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone are preliminarily determined, there is no need to modify them according to every minute change in the contact line, but when there are significant changes in the actual contact line, both parties can still propose corresponding modifications before the signing of the armistice agreement, which further prevents the armistice negotiations from being delayed endlessly, and at the same time eliminates all excuses for the other party to continue delaying the armistice negotiations. At the meeting on November 8th, the other party could not offer any reasons to oppose our side's completely fair and reasonable proposals and understandings. The two sides preliminarily entered into the correction of the existing actual line of contact. However, in correcting the existing actual line of contact, the other party finally attached a suggestion to adjust a part of the Kaesong area to be under the control of the other party. Our representative immediately rejected it sternly. Our representatives pointed out that this unacceptable demand for so-called adjustment is precisely the reason that hinders the progress of the armistice negotiations, and it is also what our side has repeatedly tried to avoid getting entangled in. If the other party insists on this requirement that our side cannot accept, then the other party will not be able to escape the responsibility for the stagnation of the armistice negotiations.

    为解除美方一切拖延谈判藉口，迅速建立停战基本条件
    我建议以现有接触线为军事分界线
    美方提不出任何理由反对；但在校正现有接触线时，又无理要求控制开城部分地区。我方当即严词拒绝。
    【新华社开城七日电】为了解除美方一切拖延停战谈判的藉口，迅速建立朝鲜停战的基本条件，以求早日恢复朝鲜的和平，我方代表在十一月七日的小组委员会上正式提议：
    （一）确定以现有实际接触线为军事分界线，并由此线各退二公里以建立非军事地区的原则。
    （二）根据上项原则，小组委员会立即着手在二十五万分之一的图上，校正现有实际接触线以具体确定双方同意的现有实际接触线为军事分界线，并由此具体确定军事分界线两侧各二公里之线为非军事区的南北缘，划出非军事地区；并建议达成以下谅解：
    甲、在具体确定现有实际接触线为军事分界线以建立非军事地区时，如一方提出调整建议，而另一方不同意时，则提议调整之一方，即应放弃其调整的建议。
    乙、小组委员会一旦在二十五万分之一的图上大体上确定了军事分界线及非军事地区的位置，小组委员会即将双方同意的军事分界线及非军事地区具体方案提交大会，并建议大会立即进入其他各项议程的讨论，而将军事分界线及非军事地区的位置在五万分之一的图上具体划定的工作，交由双方参谋所组成的委员会处理。
    丙、有鉴于按照每日实际接触线之微小变化而更改军事分界线的具体位置，显然是不实际的，如停战谈判进展迅速而实际接触线在停战协议签字前并未发生重大变化，则已经双方初步确定的军事分界线及非军事区即无须再作修改，否则双方保留在停战协议签字前提出按照实际接触线所起的变化而对军事分界线与非军事区作相应修改的建议的权利。
    自从十月二十五日双方代表团复会以来，美方虽然放弃了复会前的狂妄荒谬的提案，却又提出了占领我方开城地区的无理要求，而坚持反对我方所提出的严格遵照现有实际接触线作公平合理的必要调整的具体方案。当我方为了解除对方一切拖延谈判的藉口，提出了严格的就地停战不作任何调整的建议后，美方又提出了所谓按照停战协议签字时的接触线作适当调整以确定军事分界线和非军事区的含糊的抽象的原则，企图保留随时重行提出强占我方开城地区的无理要求的权利。为了使第二项议程的解决不致于永远纠缠在美方所提出的无理的所谓适当调整上，我方代表特在十一月七日的小组委员会上正式建议确定现有实际接触线为军事分界线，双方各撤二公里以建立非军事区的原则，并建议达成第一项谅解：一方不得坚持另一方所不同意的任何调整，以使停战谈判不致由于对方坚持无理要求而拖延不决。同时为了一方面使双方在第二项议程上达成明确具体的协议，另一方面又使停战谈判得以迅速进行起见，我方代表建议达成第二项谅解：在小组委员会确定了军事分界线与非军事地区的大体位置以后，代表团大会立即进入其他各项议程的讨论，而由双方参谋人员所组成的委员会来划定军事分界线和非军事区的详细位置。对于对方所提出的第二项议程的协议，只可能是试探性的而不可能是最后的协议的荒谬论点，我方代表指出根据对方的论点，议程中的任何一项在达成协议后随时都可以推翻而谈判将无结束地拖延下去，因此我方代表建议达成第三项谅解：如果停战谈判进展迅速而实际接触线在停战协议签字前并未发生重大变化，则已经双方初步确定的军事分界线及非军事区方案即无须再加以修改。但为了解除对方继续采取拖延政策的一切藉口，我方代表也同意在相反的情况下，双方都保留提出对军事分界线和非军事区作相应修正的权利。如果美方以我方的和平诚意为示弱，妄图使用军事力量在停战协议签字以前实现其无理要求，历史将证明好战者的命运是什么。我方新的建议是天公地道无从加以反对的。美方究竟有无诚意使朝鲜的停战谈判成功，使全世界酷爱和平的人民的初步愿望得以实现，使千百万朝鲜战场上的士兵得以回家过和平的生活，在这里将受到严重的考验。
    【新华社开城八日电】十一月八日的小组委员会上我方代表继续指出：我方在七日所正式提出的严格按照现有实际接触线双方各撤二公里以确定军事分界线和非军事区的原则，以及一方不得坚持对方所不同意的任何调整的谅解，不但是完全合乎公平对等的原则，同时也避免使停战谈判永远纠缠在一方所提出的不合理的调整上。我方所提出的小组委员会先行确定军事分界线和非军事区大体的具体位置，而将军事分界线和非军事区的详细位置留交双方参谋具体划定，以便代表团大会得以进入其他各项议程的讨论，也是完全合乎议程的规定，使军事分界线和非军事区在讨论其他各项议程前有明确具体的规定，同时也使停战谈判得以迅速进展。我方所提出的军事分界线和非军事区一旦初步确定后，即无需按照接触线的每一微小变化而加以修正，但在实际接触线确有重大变化时，双方仍可在停战协议签字前提出相应的修正的谅解，更使停战谈判免于永无休止地拖延下去，同时也解除了对方一切继续拖延停战谈判的藉口。对方在十一月八日的会上，对于我方的完全公平合理的提议和谅解，也提不出任何理由加以反对。双方初步地进入了现有实际接触线的校正。但对方在校正现有实际接触线中，最后又附带地提出了将开城地区的一部分调整到对方控制之下的建议。我方代表当即予以严词拒绝。我方代表指出：这种不能接受的所谓调整的要求，正是阻碍了停战谈判进展的原因，也是我方所一再努力避免纠缠的。如果对方坚持这种我方所不能接受的要求，则对方将无法逃脱停战谈判拖延不决的责任。
