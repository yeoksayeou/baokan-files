Editor's note: These two articles accusing the U.S. military of killing our captured personnel were written by Korean People's Army soldiers who escaped from the U.S. military's Busan and Daejeon "prisoner of war camps." The original articles were published in the Korean "Rodong Sinmun" on October 19 and November 12, 1951. They use bloody facts they witnessed to expose the U.S. military's criminal acts of killing prisoners. The following are translations of these two articles.

The Countless Blood Debts of American Murderers

朝鲜人民军战士　金泉一 (Korean People's Army Soldier Jin Quan'yi)

The American aggressors not only have countless blood debts in the war, but also arbitrarily abuse and kill captured People's Army personnel in the war. Their crimes are innumerable.

I was surrounded by the enemy while withdrawing from Chungcheongbuk-do on October 14th of last year. While trying to break out, I was unfortunately captured by the enemy. Since then, I suffered insults and abuse from American murderers amidst severe torture and icy snow, and nearly died.

Before I was押进(escorted to) the so-called "United Nations Busan Prisoner of War Camp" by the American aggressor army, I was imprisoned in Daejeon for two weeks. In Daejeon Prison, I saw American murderers kill hundreds of compatriots, including children only a few weeks old and elderly people over seventy years old. Before these innocent compatriots were murdered, they were stripped naked by American murderers, their arms were tied, and they were driven barefoot onto the snow, their faces covered in blood, a truly tragic sight!

From Daejeon to Busan, I walked for a full twenty days due to the severe pain of shrapnel wounds, eating only fifteen pieces of bread crusts left over by the executioners. My uniform turned blood-colored, and my trousers were torn to shreds. On the way, I fainted three times due to the piercing cold wind and the severe pain of the wounds, but the murderers beat me and told me to hurry up.

On the day I arrived in Busan, one of my unfortunate comrades who was captured with me finally succumbed to the cruel abuse of the American murderers and was tortured to death. Before this comrade breathed his last, he said intermittently: "Avenge... avenge me... Long... Long live General Kim Il-sung!"

But the American murderers kicked him aside, cursed for a while, and then opened their bloody mouths and cracked their dog teeth, laughing wildly.

This killing field of the "United Nations Busan Prisoner of War Camp" was surrounded by three or four layers of electric wire. From afar, one could hear the miserable cries of those being tortured in the torture chamber and the constant sounds of whips. Nine out of ten people who went in were dragged out dead. In one day, I saw American murderers drag out more than forty People's Army comrades who had been beaten to death from one torture chamber.

In addition to those beaten to death by the murderers, I also saw many comrades who died of hunger and disease being dragged out of the bloodstained prison gates by the murderers.

One day, an American murderer gave me a handful of salt to eat, then gave me nothing to eat for three days. And when I couldn't stand the hunger, they dragged me outside, tied me to a pillar, and let the bitter wind and snow blow and freeze me until I fainted, then dragged me back to the cell.

The American murderers were even more cruel to our comrades who tried to escape. Once, a comrade managed to get over the electric wire, but was discovered and caught by the American murderers. They chopped off this comrade's limbs and drove the forty or so comrades who were going to escape with him onto the snow and shot them dead with machine guns.

In addition, the murderers also妄想(deluded themselves) to get "secrets" from me. They dragged me into the gloomy torture chamber more than once, whipped me with a leather whip, and then stabbed my lower body with an awl, telling me to tell them the "secrets." Seeing that I didn't speak, they beat me again, stabbed me again after beating me, until I passed out.

Although the American murderers abused us in this way, we endured it. Except for cursing them loudly when we were in extreme pain, we never spoke. Our hearts were filled with hatred for the American murderers, and we will always love our dear motherland and people. Therefore, in the torture chambers and on the killing fields, there were constant shouts of "Long live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!" "Long live the Korean People's Army!" and "Long live General Kim Il-sung!"

One night in late November of last year, the comrades in each cell spontaneously began singing the "People's Army March." The murderers panicked and hurriedly dragged us out, wanting to execute us, but we sang even more vigorously, each of us standing tall with our chests out and glaring angrily. The murderers opened fire on us with machine guns. Some comrades fell, but those who didn't fall kept singing, and the passionate singing shook the killing field.

In this way, the American murderers, who call themselves "a civilized country of the twentieth century" and "the first-class race," are slaughtering and abusing our captured personnel every day. I want to accuse these American murderers, these American beasts, and seek justice and revenge for the tragically dead comrades!

Avenge the Comrades Who Died!

朝鲜人民军战士　洪基万 (Korean People's Army Soldier Hong Jiwan)

I was wounded in a certain battle on the eastern front and unfortunately captured by the American beasts. I suffered tortures unprecedented in the world and narrowly escaped with my life. Now I want to tell you about the abuse I suffered and the atrocities of the American beasts I saw in the "prisoner of war camp":

I and five other comrades were escorted by two American executioners to the "U.S. Military Daejeon Prisoner of War Camp." On the way to Daejeon, we suffered insults and abuse from the executioners. The "Daejeon Prisoner of War Camp" was located three kilometers from Daejeon City, surrounded by high, steep cliffs and four-meter-thick stone walls built by forced labor from the common people, with several layers of electric wire inside.

The second day we arrived, we were taken to the "interrogation room." The executioners beat us and told us to kneel in front of the "interrogating officer." Because I was severely injured in both legs and couldn't kneel down at all, the executioner cursed me for "making trouble" and shouted that he would beat me to death. I was dragged into the "torture room," where I saw executioners torturing an old man in his fifties. The old man's mouth was bleeding bright red blood, and he was constantly letting out miserable cries.

Seeing this old man subjected to such inhuman torture, my face turned green with anger. But at this moment, the executioner holding the leather whip saw my expression and laughed wildly like a beast, pointing at me: "For you, you bastard, I'm going to dig out your brains and heart and eat them!" After being beaten to within an inch of my life, I was dragged back to the cell by the beasts.

Not only that, but this killing field also held many "refugees." The executioners dragged some compatriots out of the refugee prison every day and beat them to death or killed them. They were even more cruel to women. Rape was considered light; at least several women a day had their breasts cut off and their hands and feet chopped off. Whenever these female compatriots were tortured, their cries for help were unbearable to hear.

One night when the moonlight was very bright, the beasts dragged out five more female comrades. After subjecting them to humiliation in a place where the bloodstains had turned black, they dragged us there and told us to watch the "entertainment evening for lower animals." The executioners completely pulled out their fingernails, cut off their breasts, and raped and violated them. When the beasts thought they were "satisfied," they poured gasoline on them, set them on fire, and burned them completely to death. When the fire was first lit, the five female comrades struggled and ran towards the executioners, but the executioners used their rifle butts to beat them back.

I was only in this "camp" for a week, but I saw more than half of the prisoners killed by the executioners.

On a certain day a week later, the executioners押着(escorted) us thirty or so comrades to a certain highland on the front line. They buried landmines around us and forced us to call for help to the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers,妄图(attempting) to blow up the People's Army and Volunteers who came to rescue us, along with us. But we shouted: "Comrades, don't come here, there are landmines here!" The executioners were furious and shot fifteen of our comrades. In addition, the executioners also ambushed a company of soldiers behind the mountain,企图(attempting) to capture alive those who came to rescue us, but they miscalculated, and this trick failed.

On the way back, escorted by the executioners, suddenly gunfire rang out from all sides. The ambush troops of the People's Army rushed up, rescued fifteen of us, and completely annihilated the company of beasts escorting us there.

We are now recuperating in a rear hospital. Whenever we think of the beastly atrocities of the executioners, our chests are filled with raging fire.

The Korean people cannot live a happy life until the American executioners are completely eliminated. I want to heal my wounds as soon as possible so that I can return to the front and kill a few more executioners to avenge the tragically dead comrades!

专栏：

    控诉美军杀害俘虏的滔天罪行
    编者按：这两篇控诉美军杀害我方被俘人员的文章，是从美军釜山和大田“俘虏收容所”逃出来的朝鲜人民军战士写的。原文载于一九五一年十月十九日和十一月十二日的朝鲜“劳动新闻”。他们用亲眼看到的血腥事实，揭露了美军杀害俘虏的罪恶行为。下面是这两篇文章的译文。
    美国杀人犯的血债数不完
            朝鲜人民军战士　金泉一
    美国侵略者不但在战争中血债累累，而且对在战争中被俘的人民军人员任意虐待和杀害的罪行，也是数不完的。
    我在去年十月十四日从忠清北道撤退时被敌人包围，在突围时，不幸为敌人俘虏。此后，我就在严刑拷打和水雪中受尽美国杀人犯的侮辱和虐待，险些死去。
    我被美国侵略军押进所谓“联合国军釜山俘虏收容所”之前，在大田被囚禁了两个星期。在大田监狱，我看到了美国杀人犯杀死了几百个同胞，其中有不过几周岁的幼儿，也有年逾七十的老人。这些无辜的同胞在被残害前，都被美国杀人犯剥光衣服，臂膊被捆绑着，赤着脚被赶到雪地上，满脸血迹，惨不可言！
    从大田到釜山，我因弹伤剧痛，足足走了二十天，只吃了十五块刽子手吃剩的面包皮。我的军服变成了血色，裤子也被撕碎，在中途由于刺骨的寒风和伤口的剧痛，我曾昏过去三次，但是杀人犯们却打着我，叫我快走。
    在到釜山的那一天，和我同行的一位不幸被俘的同志，终因美国杀人犯的残忍虐待，被折磨死了。这位同志在临断气之前，还断断续续地喊着：“替……替我……报……报仇啊！金日成将军万岁！”
    但是，美国杀人犯们却一脚把他踢开，骂了一阵之后，又张着血口、裂着狗牙狂笑起来。
    这个“联合国军釜山俘虏收容所”的杀人场，四周围着三、四层电网，老远就听见刑房里被拷打的人的凄惨叫声和阵阵的皮鞭声。进去的人，十个有九个是死了被拖出来。我在一天当中，看到美国杀人犯从一个刑房里拖出了四十多个被打死的人民军同志。
    除了被杀人犯打死的以外，我还看到很多饿死和病死的同志，也被杀人犯们从血迹斑斑的狱门里拖了出来。
    有一天，美国杀人犯给了我一把盐吃，接着三天没给我任何吃的东西，并且又在我饿得受不住的时候，把我拖到外面，绑在柱子上，叫严寒的风雪吹着、冻着，直到昏过去之后，再拖回牢房。
    美国杀人犯们对企图逃跑的我们的同志更是残忍。有一次，一位同志好容易越过电网，却被美国杀人犯们发觉捉了回去，他们把这位同志的四肢剁了下来，并把要和这位同志一起逃跑的四十多个同志赶到雪地上，用机枪射死。
    另外，杀人犯们还妄想从我口中得到“秘密”，曾不止一次地把我拖进阴森森的刑房，用皮鞭抽打了一顿之后，又用锥子扎我的下身，叫我说出“秘密”来，见我不开口，就又打，打了又扎，直到我晕了过去。
    美国杀人犯虽然这样虐待我们，但是我们忍受着，除了在痛极了的时候大骂他们一阵外，绝不开口。我们的心中都在痛恨着美国杀人犯，我们永远爱着自己亲爱的祖国和人民。所以在刑房里和屠杀场上不时有“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国万岁！”
    “朝鲜人民军万岁！”和“金日成将军万岁！”的呼声。
    去年十一月下旬的一个夜里，我们在各个牢房里的同志们，不约而同地唱起了“人民军进行曲”。杀人犯们慌了，连忙把我们拖了出去，要枪毙我们，但是我们唱得更加起劲，一个个都是挺着胸脯、怒目横视着。杀人犯们向我们开起机枪，有的同志倒下去了，但没倒下的还在唱，激昂的歌声震动着屠杀场。
    就这样，自称为“二十世纪文明国度”和“第一等人种”的美国杀人犯们，天天在屠杀、虐待着不幸被俘的我军人员。我要控告这些美国杀人犯、美国野兽，替惨死的同志伸冤、报仇！
                            （冰蔚译）
    要为死难的同志报仇！
            朝鲜人民军战士　洪基万
    我在东部战线某次战役中负伤后，不幸被美国野兽俘去，受尽了世上从未有过的酷刑，虎口余生，侥幸逃了出来。现在我要把我在“俘虏收容所”里所受到的虐待和看到的美国野兽的暴行说出来：
    我和另外五位同志被两个美国刽子手押着送进了“美军大田俘虏收容所”。在去大田的途中，我们受尽了刽子手的侮辱和虐待。“大田俘虏收容所”是在离大田市三公里的一个地方，周围都是很高的险峻的山崖，和强迫老百姓为他们砌成的四公尺厚的石墙，里面圈着好几层电网。
    到这里的第二天，我们就被带到“审讯室”去，刽子手打着我们叫我们跪在“审讯官”前面。我因为两腿受了重伤根本不能跪下去，于是刽子手就骂我“捣蛋”，喊嚷着要打死我。我被拖进了“拷打室”，在那里我看到刽子手们正在拷打一位五十多岁的老人，这位老人的嘴里流出鲜红的血，不断发出凄惨的叫声。
    看到这位老人受到这样惨无人道的严刑拷打，我的脸都气青了，但是这时提着皮鞭的刽子手看见我的脸色，就狂笑着像一匹野兽似地指着我：“对你，你这个家伙，我要挖出你的脑子和心来吃掉！”我被打得死去活来之后，又被野兽拖回牢房。
    不但这样，这屠杀场里还关着很多“难民”，刽子手们天天从难民牢中把一些同胞拖出来打死或杀死。对妇女则更残忍，强奸还算是轻的，割掉乳房和剁掉手、脚的至少一天有好几个，每当这些女同胞受刑的时候，她们求救的叫声惨不忍闻。
    在一个月光很亮的晚上，野兽们又拖出去五位女同志，在一个血迹已变成黑色的场子上施以凌辱之后，又把我们拖到那里，叫我们看“下等动物娱乐晚会”。刽子手们把她们的指甲完全拔掉后，又把她们的乳房割下，进行强奸蹂躏。等野兽们认为“满足”了的时候，就在她们身上浇上汽油，点起火来，把她们完全烧死。在刚一点火的时候，五位女同志挣扎起来跑向刽子手，但是刽子手们用枪托又把她们打回去。
    我在这个“收容所”里仅仅一个星期，但是却看到俘虏们被刽子手杀死了一半还多。
    在一星期之后的某日，刽子手们又把我们三十多个同志押到前线的某一高地上，在我们的四周埋上地雷，强迫我们向人民军和中国人民志愿军呼救，妄图把来救我们的人民军和志愿军连我们一起炸死。但是我们却喊：“同志们不要来啊，这里有地雷！”刽子手们气极了，就把我们中间的十五个同志枪毙了。另外，刽子手们还在山后埋伏了一个连的兵力，企图在这里活捉来救我们的人，可是他们打算错了，这一诡计未能得逞。
    在刽子手们押着我们向回走的路上，忽然四面响起了机枪声，人民军的埋伏部队冲上来了，解救了我们十五个人，并把押我们的一连野兽完全消灭在那里。
    我们现在正在后方医院养伤，每当我们想起刽子手们的野兽暴行，我们的胸中就充满了愤怒的烈火。
    在美国刽子手没有被完全消灭之前，朝鲜人民是不能过幸福的生活的。我要早日将伤养好，好回到前方去多杀死几个刽子手，为惨死的同志们报仇！
