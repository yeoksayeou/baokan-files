Premier Zhou:

The First North China County Heads Conference opened on September 19th and concluded on September 30th. A total of 723 people participated in the meeting, including 466 from provinces, cities, special districts (leagues), and counties (banners) in North China, 228 from central and North China-level organs and organizations, and 29 from major administrative regions.

During the three months of preparation for the conference, we adopted methods such as collecting materials, sending people to inspect, and dispatching people to report, conducting multifaceted investigations and research; organized government cadres above the county level to study important documents on the construction of people's democratic power, combined with inspection work, summarized experience, carried out propaganda, and conducted a typical experiment of the People's Representative Conference exercising the functions of the People's Congress in Tong County. On the basis of the above, the draft reports of the conference were drafted. In addition to repeated discussions and revisions by the preparatory committee, opinions were solicited from cadres of various provinces and some special districts and counties. All these preparatory work not only obtained the full cooperation of the relevant departments of the Central People's Government and the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, but also promoted the active participation of the people's governments at all levels in the five provinces, making the preparation process of the conference an actual process of improving cadres' thinking and effectively promoting work, that is, preparing the necessary conditions for holding the conference well.

During the conference, in addition to inviting central leaders to attend the meeting to speak and give instructions, Vice Premier Dong Biwu, Secretary-General Li Weihan, and Comrade Bo Yibo gave special reports on political power construction, united front work, and the development of agricultural production in North China, respectively; Minister Xie Juezai gave a report on "Conscientiously Strengthening the Work of Providing Special Care to Servicemen and Their Families," and I gave a report on "Further Strengthening the Work of the County People's Representative Conference." The conference focused on the two tasks of political power construction and preferential treatment, and conducted repeated discussions in groups and at the general meeting,展开开展criticism and self-criticism, and exchanged work experience from various places. All participants further clarified in their thinking that the People's Representative Conference is the basic system of our country, and that the work of preferential treatment is a long-term political task in our various places. Finally, in addition to adopting the two reports "Further Strengthening the Work of the County People's Representative Conference" and "Conscientiously Strengthening the Work of Providing Special Care to Servicemen and Their Families" as two special resolutions of the conference, and in accordance with the central government's instructions on national tasks and the current main requirements of the people of North China, the "Resolution on the Ten Current Tasks of the County People's Government" was adopted as the basis for the work of the people's governments of all counties (banners) in the North China region this winter and next year. The above three resolutions are attached to the report for review and approval.

In addition, during the conference, this department, in conjunction with the relevant departments of the Central People's Government, made timely measures on the disaster situation and disaster relief work in various provinces of North China; and also studied the special problems in the minority areas of Suiyuan.

After the meeting, we also organized the participants to participate in the National Day ceremony and visit the North China Urban and Rural Material Exchange Exhibition in Tianjin and the Tianjin factories, which were all beneficial to broaden the horizons of comrades who have been working in rural areas for a long time and enhance their confidence and strength in the construction of the new China. The county heads and commissioners who participated in the meeting were satisfied with this conference. The general reflection is that this conference "explained the principles thoroughly and solved the problems." It is hoped that such a meeting can be held once a year. As for some specific issues raised by various places related to strengthening the construction of political power and improving administrative efficiency (such as funding, staffing, and regionalization), no special discussions were held at the meeting, and therefore no specific solutions were obtained. We are prepared to study them with the specialized management agencies and then submit specific opinions for verification.

Liu Lantao, October 30th

　　中央人民政府华北事务部关于华北第一次县长会议的报告
        （一九五一年十一月九日刘澜涛部长在政务院第一百一十次政务会议上的报告，并经同次会议批准）周总理：
    华北第一次县长会议于九月十九日开幕，三十日结束。参加会议的计有：华北各省、市、专（盟）、县（旗）四六六人，中央和华北级各机关、团体二二八人，各大行政区二九人，共七二三人。
    会议经三个月的筹备，我们采取了搜集资料、派人视察、调人汇报等方法，多方面地调查研究；组织了县以上的政府干部进行对人民民主政权建设重要文件的学习，结合检查工作，总结经验，展开宣传，并在通县作了人民代表会议代行人民代表大会职权的典型试验。在上述基础上，起草会议的各项报告草案，除筹备委员会反复讨论修改外，并征求了各省和有些专、县干部的意见。所有这些准备工作，不仅取得了中央人民政府有关部门和中共中央华北局的通力合作，而且推动了五省各级人民政府的积极参加，使会议的筹备过程，实际成为提高干部思想与有效地推动工作的过程，亦即是为开好这次会议准备了必要的条件。
    会议期间，除邀请中央各首长莅会讲话和指示外，董必武副总理、李维汉秘书长、薄一波同志分别向会议作了关于政权建设、统一战线和发展华北农业生产等专题报告；谢觉哉部长作了“认真加强优抚工作”的报告，我作了“进一步加强县人民代表会议的工作”的报告。会议以政权建设和优抚工作两项为中心，进行了小组和大会的反复讨论，展开批评与自我批评，交流了各地工作经验。全体与会人员在思想上进一步明确认识了人民代表会议是我们国家的基本制度，而优抚工作是我们各地的一个长期的政治任务。最后，除通过“进一步加强县人民代表会议的工作”和“认真加强优抚工作”两报告作为会议的两项专门决议外，并根据中央对全国任务的指示和华北人民的当前主要要求，通过了“关于县人民政府当前十项工作的决议”，作为华北全区各县（旗）人民政府今冬和明年的工作依据。上述三项决议，随报告附上，请审核批示。
    此外，在会议期间，本部会同中央人民政府有关部门对华北各省灾情和救灾工作，作了及时的措施；对绥远少数民族地区的特殊问题也作了研究。
    会后，我们又组织与会人员参加了国庆典礼，并参观了天津的华北城乡物资交流展览会及天津市工厂，对开阔长期在农村工作同志的眼界，增进他们对新中国建设事业的信心和力量，均有良好收获。与会的县长、专员对此次会议感到满意。一般反映此次会议“道理说得透，解决问题”。希望这样的会议每年能开一次。至于各地提出有关加强政权建设和提高行政效率的若干具体问题（如经费、编制、区划等），会议上未作专门讨论，因而未得到具体解决，我们准备和专管机关研究后提出具体意见，再请核示。
                    刘澜涛  十月三十日
