During the symposium, Wang Ziye, Deputy Director of the People's Publishing House, introduced the People's Publishing House's inspection work and the experience of organizing the "Error Inspection Exhibition," and pointed out that this exhibition not only educated all the working comrades of the People's Publishing House, but also aroused the serious attention of other news and publishing units.

Their error rate in October was 0.0058% in the first week and decreased to 0.001% in the last week.
