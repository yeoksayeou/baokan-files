　　Supporting Vyshinsky's Peace Proposals
    Editor: Soviet representative Vyshinsky's speech at the Sixth UN General Assembly on November 8th made me deeply realize once again the greatness of the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy and its efforts for world peace. Although I have had a lot of experience with this in the two years since liberation, it has never been as profound as it is today.
    We know that in the United Nations, which is manipulated by US imperialism, only the representatives of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries can represent the will of the people of the world and work for world peace, engaging in open struggle against the imperialist bloc at the meeting.
    Vyshinsky said: The task of the Soviet delegation is still to guide the General Assembly to work hard to remove those obstacles that hinder the consolidation of peace and international cooperation, and to eliminate the threat of another world war. This is completely in line with the wishes of our peace-loving people. Vyshinsky's loud and powerful voice will make the warmongers tremble!
    We support Vyshinsky's speech and will do our best to support the four peace proposals he put forward.

　　拥护维辛斯基的和平建议
    编辑同志：苏联代表维辛斯基在第六届联合国大会十一月八日会议上发表的演说，使我又一次深深地体会到苏联和平外交政策的伟大和为世界和平所作的努力。虽然解放以后两年来我对此已经有了不少的体会，但是总没有今天这样的深刻。
    我们知道，在联合国被美帝国主义操纵的情形下，只有苏联和人民民主国家的代表，才能代表全世界人民的意志为世界和平而努力，在会上向帝国主义集团作公开的斗争。
    维辛斯基说：苏联代表团的任务，仍是引导大会努力扫除那些妨碍和平与国际合作的巩固的种种障碍，消除另一次世界大战的威胁。这是完全符合我们爱好和平的人民的愿望的。维辛斯基的响亮有力的声音，将使战争贩子们发抖！
    我们拥护维辛斯基的演说，并且要尽力支持他所提出的四项和平建议。
