Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd dispatch: Cairo News: British troops illegally stationed in the Egyptian Suez Canal Zone carried out another barbaric bloody suppression of the Egyptian people in the city of Ismailia in the area on the 18th of this month. British troops bombarded Ismailia with warships and sent jet planes to circle low over the city; at the same time, they directly attacked the Egyptian people with tanks, field guns, and machine guns, and cruelly shot women, children, and the elderly. British residents living in Ismailia also fired at Egyptians passing by on the street from balconies or windows. The British army also occupied the medical facilities of the "Red Crescent Society" and refused to provide first aid to injured Egyptians.

　　People throughout Egypt expressed great indignation at the British army's atrocities. Students in Cairo held strikes and large-scale demonstrations on the 19th and 20th, shouting slogans against British, American, and French imperialism. They shouted, "Give us weapons to avenge our brothers!" The people of Tanta in the Nile Delta also launched a general strike to protest the British army's atrocities.

    【新华社二十二日讯】开罗消息：非法驻扎在埃及苏彝士运河区的英国军队，本月十八日又对该地区伊士美利亚城的埃及人民进行野蛮的血腥镇压。英军一面用军舰轰击伊士美利亚城，并派喷气飞机在该城上空低飞盘旋；一面以坦克、野战炮、机关枪直接攻击埃及人民，残忍地枪击妇女、儿童和老人。住在伊士美利亚城的英国侨民也从阳台上或窗口向街上过路的埃及人开枪射击。英军并占领了“红月牙协会”的医务机构，拒绝急救受伤的埃及人。
    伊士美利亚的埃及人民在遭受攻击时，曾奋起用石子和从英国侵略者那里夺来的枪支，进行英勇的自卫。第二天，伊士美利亚城有二万五千埃及居民抬着被杀害者的棺材举行示威游行。
    埃及各地人民对英军的暴行表示极大愤恨。开罗学生在十九日、二十日举行罢课和大规模的示威游行，他们高喊反对英、美、法帝国主义的口号。他们高呼：“给我们武器，为我们的兄弟复仇！”在尼罗河三角洲的坦塔城的人民为抗议英军的暴行，也发动了普遍罢工。
    开罗《埃及人报》发表社论，抗议英军的野蛮暴行说：“埃及人一定要为烈士们复仇，……埃及人在把英国人驱逐出去之前，决不停止战斗。”
    【新华社二十二日讯】电通社布拉格十九日讯：国际学生联合会最近代表七十一个国家的五百五十万学生致电埃及和苏丹的学生，声援埃及人民反抗英帝国主义的英勇斗争。电文说：“全世界学生正以关切和同情的心情注视着你们近来的斗争。国际学生联合会曾接到许多国家的学生拍来的电报，声援你们的斗争。你们争取国家独立、反对外国军队驻扎、反对你们国家加入侵略集团的斗争，对于世界和平事业是有重要贡献的。维持世界和平与获得国家独立，是争取真正民族的、民主的教育制度和美好将来的必要条件。国际学生联合会代表七十一个国家的五百五十万学生向你们表示：他们愿充分支持和声援你们的斗争。”
    国际学生联合会并号召全世界各国学生积极支持埃及人民的正义斗争。
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社喀喇蚩讯：巴基斯坦首都喀喇蚩附近的考柏拉工厂工人以及其他企业的工人、职员和学生共约一万人，于十八日举行盛大集会，支持埃及人民的斗争。大会上的发言者一致严厉指责英帝国主义在近东所执行的侵略政策。巴基斯坦制宪议会议员米安·伊夫提卡鲁丁在会上发表演讲说：美英帝国主义者是“亚洲各国人民的主要敌人，它们想剥夺各国人民的独立权利”。他敦促巴基斯坦人民一致行动，与全世界爱好和平和自由的人民一道，为消灭亚洲和非洲许多国家中的殖民秩序而斗争。大会最后通过决议，表示声援埃及人民反对英帝国主义的斗争。
    同时，巴基斯坦海得拉巴区丹度佳马举行的农民代表会议也通过决议，声援埃及人民反对英帝国主义的民族解放运动以及亚洲和中东各国人民的民族解放运动。
