　　Beijing Citizens and All Government Units Should Pay Serious Attention to Winter Fire Prevention
    To the Editor: Winter is here, and all government units, organizations, factories, schools, and citizens will be using stoves for heating. Coupled with the dry weather, this makes it very easy for fires to occur. Therefore, we believe that all units and the general public in the capital, especially construction sites where houses are being built, should be more vigilant, constantly check fire-fighting equipment, and prevent fires.
    Since July, Beijing has had 115 fire alarms, five of which became disasters, resulting in two deaths, twenty-three injuries, and property losses exceeding 720,000 jin of millet. This is a situation that deserves serious attention.
    Most of these fire alarms and fires were caused by chimney and stove fires, electrical shorts, careless smoking, and children playing with fire. Some government units do not pay enough attention to fire prevention on weekdays and are complacent, even ignoring the fire prevention suggestions of the Public Security Bureau's fire brigade, which led to fires. For example, a construction site of the Twelfth Work Area of a certain construction office outside Fuxingmen had a fire on the 9th of this month, burning down two large sheds and all the building materials stored inside. Before this fire, the Beijing Public Security Bureau's fire brigade had twice inspected the construction site for fire prevention, making many fire prevention suggestions. Later, the Municipal Public Security Bureau sent a letter to a construction office, urging them to pay attention to the fire prevention issue at the construction site. However, these did not attract the attention of the person in charge of the construction site and their superiors. Eventually, a fire was caused by an electrician's carelessness when repairing an electric light. Another example is the Xinxinren Wood Shop in Nanwei Road, Ninth District, under the leadership of the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China. Before the fire on the 9th of this month, the Municipal Public Security Bureau's fire brigade had made specific fire prevention suggestions to the shop seven times. However, due to the serious complacency of the shop's leadership, except for the installation of some fire-fighting equipment, not all of the fire brigade's suggestions were adopted, and a fire finally occurred. In addition to property losses worth about 27 million yuan, it also burned to death two workers, Li Shuming and Zhang Fu. We believe that such a phenomenon of not paying attention to fire prevention on weekdays, not adopting the fire brigade's suggestions, and seriously neglecting the safety of workers' lives is intolerable. The person in charge of the relevant unit should make a profound self-criticism and publish it in the newspaper. Everyone should accept these painful lessons and quickly pay attention to fire prevention to ensure the safety of people's lives and property. Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau Propaganda Section

    Editor's note: This letter from the Propaganda Section of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau tells us two things: First, any negligence will cause huge losses. With the arrival of winter, all government organizations and citizens must be careful with fire and overcome complacency to avoid causing undue losses to state and people's property. Second, the bureaucratic style of some leading cadres and administrative cadres in government organizations is the main cause of fires. The fire at the construction site of the Twelfth Work Area of a certain construction office and the fire at the Xinxinren Wood Shop in Nanwei Road, Ninth District, under the leadership of the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China, cited in this letter, are two obvious examples. This bureaucratic style must be resolutely examined and corrected.

### 北京市市民和各机关单位应严重注意冬季防火问题

　　北京市市民和各机关单位应严重注意冬季防火问题
    编辑同志：目前冬季已到，各机关、团体、工厂、学校和市民都要生炉火，再加上天气干燥，最容易发生火灾。因此，我们认为，首都各单位和广大市民、特别是正在修建房屋的施工地点更应提高警惕，随时检查防火设备，防止火灾。
    首都自七月份以来，已连续发生火警一一五起。其中有五起成灾，共烧死两人，烧伤二十三人，财产的损失在七十二万斤小米以上。这是一个值得严重注意的情况。
    这些火警和火灾，大多数是因烟筒、炉灶滋火，电线走电，以及吸烟不慎和小孩玩火等酿成。有些机关单位平日对防火注意不够，思想麻痹，甚至不接受公安局消防队防火的建议，所以发生了火灾。如复兴门外某修建办事处第十二工区施工地点本月九日发生火灾，烧毁大工棚两座和存放其中的全部建筑器材。在这次火灾发生前，北京市公安局消防队曾两次到该施工地点进行防火检查，提出许多防火建议。后来市公安局又曾致函某修建办事处，促请注意该施工地点的防火问题。但是这些均未引起该施工地点的负责人和其上级的重视。终因电灯工人修理电灯不慎而酿成火灾。再如人民银行北京分行领导的第九区南纬路新新人记木器行在本月九日发生火灾以前，市公安局消防队曾先后七次向该行提出防火的具体建议，但因该行领导方面存在着严重的麻痹思想，除设置了一些消防器材以外，并未全部采纳消防队的建议，终于发生了火灾。除财产损失约值二千七百万元以外，还烧死了李书明和张福有两个工人。我们认为像这种平日不注意防火问题，又不采纳消防队的建议，严重忽视工人生命安全的现象，是不能容忍的。有关单位的负责人应作出深刻检讨在报上公布。大家应接受这些沉痛的教训，迅速注意防火问题，以保障人民生命财产的安全。北京市公安局宣传科
    编者按：北京市公安局宣传科的这封来信告诉我们两件事情：一、任何麻痹大意，都会造成巨大损失。在冬季到来的时候，所有机关团体和市民都必须小心烟火，克服麻痹思想，以免再使国家、人民财产遭受不应有的损失。二、在机关团体中，某些领导干部和行政干部的官僚主义作风是造成火灾的主要原因。这封信里所举的某修建办事处第十二工区施工地点的火灾，和人民银行北京分行领导的第九区南纬路新新人记木器行的火灾，就是两个明显的例子。对于这种官僚主义作风，必须坚决地予以检查和纠正。
