Xinhua News Agency, November 19th: British "Daily Worker" reporter Alan Winnington reported from Panmunjom on the 18th: The short subcommittee meeting on the 18th involved discussing the U.S.'s new proposal and reviewing some unclear points in their draft proposal. The U.S. presented this new proposal after more than three weeks of obstruction, during which they frantically engaged in public deception, the main purpose of which was to seize Kaesong. However, due to the Korean and Chinese side's continuous exposure of the truth inside the conference tent and the U.S.'s propaganda outside the tent, the U.S. faced a global public demand that they resolve the critical issue of the demarcation line. U.S. press officer Nokes had to fly to Tokyo to try to silence the British, French, and American news agencies, as these agencies had been trying to bypass the Korean censorship and learn the truth via Tokyo. But Nokes failed. Reporters who heard it said, "Nokes's words are not credible." The growing public pressure and increasing battlefield losses arising from the U.S. obstruction of negotiations have forced the U.S. to put forward a new proposal. The recklessness of everything the U.S. has done can be seen from the sudden, brazen, and self-contradictory lies about the POW issue last week, which are clearly a pretext used by some senior U.S. personnel to sabotage the negotiations. Although American reporters today denied any such intention, they also said that the figures given by Hanley could not withstand even the slightest scrutiny. This fabricated POW killing incident cannot help but remind people of the bombing incident on August 22nd, which almost caused the negotiations to collapse when the two sides were close to reaching an agreement. In addition, the fabricated killing of prisoners may have two other purposes: one is to cover up the U.S.'s undeclared losses—the U.S. may have to announce these losses if the negotiations succeed; the other is to leave a final trump card in order to obstruct the meeting on the fourth agenda item—the POW issue—about which they have been predicting terrible "difficulties." The enormous pressure of public opinion has forced the U.S. to put forward a new proposal, which is progress. But having seen all kinds of rogue and gangster tactics they are playing here with my own eyes, I must say that people should not be satisfied with this and should recognize that only by strengthening this pressure can we force the U.S. to truly seek peace talks.

    美方关于战俘问题的谎言
    显系用来破坏谈判的藉口
    【新华社十九日讯】英国工人日报记者阿兰·魏宁顿十八日自板门店报道：十八日的短时间的小组委员会会议的内容，是讨论美方的新建议和审查他们的建议草案中的一些不清楚的地方。美方在进行了三个多星期的阻挠以后提出这个新建议；在这三个多星期中，他们拼命进行欺骗公众的活动，其主要目的是夺取开城。但是由于朝中方面不断揭露会议帐篷以内的真实情况和美方在帐篷以外的造谣宣传，美方遇到了全世界公众要求他们解决极关紧要的分界线问题的这样一种危机。美方新闻发布官纳科斯不得不飞往东京，设法堵塞英国、法国和美国通讯社的嘴，因为这些通讯社一直在设法绕过朝鲜的新闻检查经过东京了解真实情况。但纳科斯失败了。记者们听了以后说：“纳科斯的话不能使人相信。”在美方阻挠谈判的过程中出现的愈来愈大的舆论压力和战场上的愈来愈大的损失，迫使美方提出新建议。美方所干的一切勾当都是十分轻率的，这可以从上星期突如其来的关于战俘问题的无耻的自相矛盾的谎言中看出来，这种谎言显然是美方某些高级人员用来破坏谈判的藉口而已。美国记者今天虽然否认有这种意图，却又说汉莱说出的数字是经不起稍加检查的。这个捏造的杀害战俘事件使人们不禁竦然想起八月二十二日的轰炸事件，这个事件几乎使谈判在双方快要达成协议的时候陷于破裂。除此以外，捏造的杀害俘虏事件可能还有两个目的：一个目的是掩饰美方没有宣布的损失——万一谈判成功，美方也许不得不公布这种损失；另一个目的是留下最后一张王牌，以便在第四项议程——战俘问题——上阻挠会议的进行；关于这项议程，他们一直就在预测可怕的“困难”。舆论的巨大压力迫使美方提出新建议，这是一种进展。但是我亲眼看到他们在这里耍各种流氓无赖手腕，我要说，人们不应当因此感到满足，应当认识，只有加强这种压力，才能迫使美方真正来设法谈和。
