　　Protest the South African Reactionary Government's Persecution of South African Progressive Public Opinion

　　The Malan government of the Union of South Africa, which has consistently followed the US and British imperialism in implementing anti-communist and anti-democratic policies, is now creating pretexts to close down the "Vanguard" weekly, a South African progressive newspaper that resolutely fights for the interests of the South African people, in order to further stifle the just voices of the South African people demanding peace and democracy and opposing racial oppression. The Chinese people express serious protest against the Malan government's reactionary measures to undermine progressive public opinion, and extend sincere concern and support to the "Vanguard" weekly and all progressive forces of the South African people who are fighting for freedom and democracy.

　　Since taking power more than three years ago, the South African Malan Nationalist Party has consistently suppressed the people's political rights and brutally suppressed the South African Communist Party, the true defender of the interests of all ethnic groups in South Africa. The Malan government has also implemented policies of racial segregation and other forms of national oppression. These reactionary measures by the South African reactionary authorities are an attempt to further transform South Africa into a police state and serve the aggressive interests of US and British imperialism in Africa.

　　The struggle of the South African "Vanguard" weekly and other progressive forces against the Malan government, against racial discrimination, and for democratic freedom is entirely in line with the interests of the South African people. The South African government's persecution of such a democratic newspaper and its attempt to further destroy it can only demonstrate its fear of the tremendous influence that the "Vanguard" weekly has among the broad masses of the South African people.

　　We believe that no reactionary force can suppress the people's desire for freedom, nor can it stop social progress. The reactionary schemes of the South African Malan government will inevitably meet with final failure in the face of the increasingly powerful forces of the South African people.

    抗议南非反动政府迫害南非
    进步舆论
    一贯追随美英帝国主义执行反共反民主政策的南非联邦的马兰政府，为了进一步窒息南非人民要求和平民主与反对种族压迫的正义声音，最近正在制造藉口，企图封闭为南非人民利益而坚决奋斗的南非进步报纸“前卫”周刊。中国人民对于马兰政府这一摧残进步舆论的反动措施表示严重的抗议，并以真诚的关怀与支持寄予为自由与民主而奋斗的“前卫”周刊和南非人民的一切进步力量。
    南非马兰国民党自执政的三年余来，一贯地摧残人民的政治权利，并对南非各族人民利益的真正捍卫者南非共产党横加镇压。马兰政府并且还实施种族分居等民族压迫的政策。南非反动当局这种反动措施，是企图进一步变南非为一个警察国家，而为美英帝国主义在非洲的侵略利益服务。
    南非“前卫”周刊与其他进步力量反对马兰政府、反对种族歧视与要求民主自由的斗争，是完全符合南非人民的利益的。南非政府对于这样一个民主报纸的迫害与企图进一步加以摧残，不能说明别的，只能说明它对于“前卫”周刊在南非广大人民中所具有的巨大影响的恐惧。
    我们相信，任何反动的势力决不能抑制人民爱好自由的愿望，也决不能阻止社会的进步。南非马兰政府的反动阴谋，在日益强大的南非人民力量面前，一定会遭到最后的失败。
