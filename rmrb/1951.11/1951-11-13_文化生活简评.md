    Strengthen Leadership of the Winter School Movement

    According to the current central tasks of the country, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government instructed all localities to strengthen political and current affairs education in winter schools, popularize and deepen patriotic education against U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and promote the patriotic production increase and patriotic pact movement. This is a timely and important instruction as winter schools are about to begin in various regions.

    This year's winter schools should serve the central tasks of strengthening the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and promoting the movement to increase production and practice economy. Leading organs at all levels must pay enough attention to the work of winter schools and regard winter schools as an important tool for realizing the central tasks. It is necessary to formulate specific tasks and specific plans for the region according to the specific circumstances and needs of the masses, and based on the experience of previous winter school movements. It is necessary to vigorously strengthen political and current affairs education in winter schools, so that the peasant masses are universally educated in patriotic anti-Americanism and aid-Korea ideology, and promote the movement to increase production, practice economy, and implement patriotic pacts; at the same time, we must also take care of the cultural needs of the liberated peasants, and in areas with conditions and a foundation, not relax cultural literacy education, so that political education and cultural education are appropriately combined.

    In terms of guiding ideology, we should overcome the erroneous views and practices of isolating or opposing the central work, political education, and cultural learning from each other. We should prevent and correct the tendency to simply emphasize cultural learning while neglecting political and current affairs education; at the same time, we should overcome the tendency to only carry out verbal propaganda and mobilization and abandon cultural literacy education. When arranging and inspecting winter school work, the leading organs in various regions must emphasize explaining and implementing this policy.

    Because the land reform throughout the country, except for minority areas, will be fully completed next year, with the recovery of agricultural production and the improvement of the lives of peasants, the learning requirements of the broad masses of peasants are becoming increasingly urgent. The number of students enrolled in winter schools last year reached 25 million. By August and September this year, the number of people who had transferred to regular people's schools had exceeded 11 million. Now, according to various conditions, the Central Ministry of Education has put forward the goals for this year's winter schools and people's schools: the number of winter school students should reach 35 million, and the number of people transferring to regular people's schools next year should reach 18 million. Leading organs at all levels should strengthen the leadership of this movement and strive to complete this task; and strive to make this year's winter school achieve even greater achievements than last year in continuing to carry out the anti-American and aid-Korea work, expanding the patriotic production increase movement, and improving the cultural level of peasants.

    Implement the Education Policy of "Opening the Door to Workers and Peasants"

    New democratic education must first serve the workers and peasants. Educational institutions should not only give the broad masses of workers' and peasants' children every opportunity and convenience to enroll, but also should systematically and step by step cultivate a large number of high-level construction talents from among them as the backbone of our national construction. The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government clearly pointed this out in the "Decision on the Reform of the School System." In the two years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, we have achieved certain results in this regard, but on a national scale, the education policy of "opening the door to workers and peasants" has not been well implemented; some schools in some areas even refuse workers' and peasants' children to enroll and restrict their enrollment. This is an unacceptable phenomenon. For example, the Second Complete Primary School in Chengguan District, Jixian County, Pingyuan Province, has repeatedly refused workers' and peasants' children to enroll. Their reasons are: "Workers' and peasants' children wear coarse cloth clothes and coarse cloth shoes, which are very clumsy; it is not good to dance the Yangko. After enrolling, the learning progress is slow, which affects the average performance of the school. The school also needs to help them establish a food group in the school, which is very troublesome." Therefore, some workers' and peasants' children who applied to the school were rejected under the pretext that "the school cannot start a fire." In Shanghai, some schools "in 'principle' do not object to absorbing workers' and peasants' children," but they always dislike them for being "dirty" and fear that it will affect the "cleanliness and hygiene" of the school. This is simply an insult to the working people! Some areas do not pay enough attention to the enrollment of workers' and peasants' children. For example, some peasants in Fuping area, Hebei Province, cannot let their children go to school all day because of lack of labor, and some schools have collapsed. However, the local leaders did not actively try to solve this problem, and even let the children drop out of school without asking. Some areas emphasize regularization and do not take care of the specific circumstances of the rural environment; and some areas simply restrict the enrollment of peasant children in terms of age. These facts all show that some educators are very vague in their understanding of the policies and tasks of new democratic education. This situation must be brought to the attention of the cultural and educational leading organs in various regions, and appropriate inspections should be carried out to correct this erroneous tendency.

　　文化生活简评
    加强对冬学运动的领导
    中央人民政府教育部根据当前国家的中心任务，指示各地冬学应加强政治时事教育，普及与深入抗美援朝爱国主义教育及推进爱国增产和爱国公约运动。这在各地冬学即将开始的今天，是切合时宜的重要指示。
    今年的冬学，应该为加强抗美援朝运动，推行增产节约运动的中心任务而服务。各地领导机关必须足够地重视冬学工作，把冬学看作实现中心任务的重要工具。要依据当地的具体情况与群众需要，吸收历年冬学运动的经验，明确规定本地区的具体任务与具体计划。要在冬学中大力加强政治时事教育，使农民群众普遍受到抗美援朝爱国主义教育，并推进增产节约与爱国公约运动；同时又要照顾翻身农民的文化要求，在有条件有基础的地区，不放松进行文化识字教育，使政治教育与文化教育适当地结合着进行。
    在领导思想上应克服中心工作、政治教育和文化学习彼此孤立的或对立的错误看法和做法。应该防止和纠正因单纯强调文化学习而轻视政治时事教育的偏向；同时又应该克服只进行口头宣传鼓动而放弃文化识字教育的偏向。各地领导机关，在布置与检查冬学工作时，必须着重地说明和贯彻这一方针。
    由于全国各地的土地改革，除少数民族地区外，即将在明年全部完成，随着农业生产的恢复与农民生活的改善，广大农民群众的学习要求是越来越迫切了。去年冬学的入学人数已达二千五百万人。到今年八、九月间，转入常年民校学习的人数，已有一千一百万人以上。现在中央教育部根据各种条件，提出了今年冬学和民校的奋斗目标：冬学人数要达到三千五百万人，明年转入常年民校的人数要达到一千八百万人。各级领导机关应加强这一运动的领导，争取完成这一任务；务使今年的冬学，在广大农民继续开展抗美援朝工作、扩大爱国增产运动与提高农民文化水平等等方面，获得比去年更加巨大的成就。
    贯彻“向工农开门”的教育方针
    新民主主义的教育必须首先为工农服务。教育机关不仅应该给广大的工农子弟以一切入学的机会与方便，还应该有计划、有步骤地从他们中间培养大批的高级建设人才，做为我们国家建设的骨干。中央人民政府政务院在《关于改革学制的决定》中，就明确地指出了这一点。中华人民共和国成立两年来，我们在这方面已收到了一定的成效，但就全国范围来讲，“向工农开门”的教育方针，还没有很好的贯彻；某些地区的某些学校，甚至拒绝工农子弟入学，对于工农子弟的入学加以限制。这是不应该有的现象。如平原省汲县城关区第二完全小学，就曾发生过多次拒绝工农子弟入学的事件。他们的理由是：“工农子弟穿的是粗布衣，粗布鞋，很笨；扭起秧歌来很不好看。入学后学习进度慢，影响学校的平均成绩。还要学校方面帮助他们在校内建立伙食团，很麻烦。”因此，有些到该校投考的工农子弟，均在“学校不能起火”的借口下被拒绝了。在上海有的学校在“‘原则’上不反对吸收工农子弟”，但总嫌他们“脏”，怕影响学校的“清洁卫生”。这简直是污辱工农群众！有些地区对工农子弟的入学问题，很不重视。如河北省阜平地区的有些农民，因缺乏劳动力，不能让子弟整天上学，有的学校就垮了下来。但当地领导方面没有积极设法解决这一问题，竟听任孩子们失学，而不加过问。有的地区强调正规化，不照顾农村环境的具体情况；也有的地区竟单纯地从年龄方面限制农民子弟入学。这些事实，都说明了部分教育工作者，在对于新民主主义教育的方针、任务的认识上，是十分模糊的。这种情况，必须引起各地区文教领导机关应有的注意，并进行适当地检查，以期纠正这种错误倾向。
