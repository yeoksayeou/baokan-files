Striving to promote the Hao Jianxiu Work Method nationwide

By summarizing and promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method

Qingdao Municipal Textile Union's work is further oriented towards production

The Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Chinese Textile Union has made great strides in its work by summarizing and promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method.

In the past, the Qingdao Municipal Textile Union's implementation of the policy of being oriented towards production was not thorough enough, mainly because it did not know how to summarize and promote advanced experience. Whenever advanced figures and advanced experiences emerged among the masses, they often only sent one or two union cadres to learn about the situation or talk to the advanced figures, considering it as summarizing advanced experience. For example, the Liu Tonggao group of the state-owned Qingdao Textile Machinery Factory had created 174 new records in the past year; however, when the cadres of the Municipal Textile Union summarized the experience of this group, they only summarized a few points such as "good unity, good democratic style, and establishment of a lunch system." Many workers felt that this experience was empty and unacceptable. Thus, the advanced experience of this group was actually buried.

The situation of summarizing and promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method this time was different from the past. This time, the Municipal Textile Union's summary and promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method received strong support from the National Committee of the Chinese Textile Union, the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Qingdao Branch of the East China Textile Administration Bureau, so they attached great importance to Hao Jianxiu's creation in their thinking. In order to carefully summarize Hao Jianxiu's work method, they organized the Hao Jianxiu Work Method Research Committee (including union cadres, technicians, and outstanding spinning workers), conducted multiple measurements, observations, and analyses, and studied the advanced experience of the Soviet Union before finally succeeding in the summary. Then, they organized promotion groups and inspection groups to go to various factories for promotion and in-depth inspection, promoting the continuous development of the movement. During this period, the Municipal Textile Union also instructed union cadres in various textile factories to seriously study the experience of summarizing the Hao Jianxiu Work Method and further summarize the various creations of textile workers. Accepting this instruction, the union cadres in various factories successively summarized the specific experiences of applying the Hao Jianxiu Work Method in various cotton textile production sequences such as cleaning, carding, drawing, roving, and packaging, making the Hao Jianxiu Work Method more widely promoted. In late August, the Weaving Work Method Research Committee, mainly composed of the Municipal Textile Union, summarized the weaving work methods of seven outstanding workers, including Jiang Aizhi, Wei Xiuying, and Sun Xiuzhen, in the weaving workshops of seven state-owned cotton textile factories; then, using the Guo Walyov method of synthesizing advanced experience, they analyzed and studied the advantages of the weaving work methods of these seven workers and synthesized a relatively scientific "Advanced Work Method for Automatic Looms." This work method made a great contribution to the "1951 Weaving Work Method" summarized by the recent National Weaving Work Method Conference.

Through the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, the Qingdao Municipal Textile Union and the union in various factories have gradually learned how to discover, summarize, and promote advanced experience. The work of grassroots trade unions is unprecedentedly active. Ding Wen, the Minister of the Production Department of the Municipal Textile Union, also participated in the Automatic Loom Work Method Research Committee, observing and measuring in the workshop every day, and studying the progress of the trial work method with everyone in the evening. He said: "In the past, we didn't understand how to be oriented towards production, and our work was busy and chaotic, with no beginning or end; now we can discover problems, summarize and promote advanced experience, and our work has a beginning and an end, gradually deepening and improving, and we are more and more interested in it!"

The promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method has also promoted the progress of technicians in various factories. When Wang Erxiang, a technician at the state-owned Qingdao No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory, first participated in the Hao Jianxiu Work Method Summary Committee, he still believed that Hao Jianxiu only produced five or six liang less of leather roller waste every day, which was worth at most 10,000 or 8,000 yuan, and felt that this was "making a mountain out of a molehill." However, the good results obtained by promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method proved that his previous view was wrong. He later studied and promoted the Hao Jianxiu Work Method very actively and became a very patient teacher. The phenomenon of some technicians going to the workshop to take a quick look and deal with official business in the past no longer exists in various factories.

### 通过总结和推广郝建秀工作法  青岛市纺织工会工作进一步面向生产

    为在全国范围内推行郝建秀工作法而斗争
    通过总结和推广郝建秀工作法
    青岛市纺织工会工作进一步面向生产
    中国纺织工会青岛市委员会通过总结和推广郝建秀工作法，使工会工作大大前进了一步。
    过去青岛市纺织工会在执行面向生产的方针时，工作不够深入，主要是因为不会总结和推广先进经验。每逢群众中出现先进人物和先进经验时，他们往往只派一两个工会干部去了解一下情况，或者找先进人物谈谈话，就算总结先进经验了。譬如国营青岛纺织机械厂刘同诰小组一年来曾创造了一百七十四次新纪录；但市纺织工会干部在总结这一小组的经验时，却只总结出“团结好、民主作风好、建立午饭制度”等几条经验。很多工人都感到这个经验空洞，没法接受。这样，这个小组的先进经验实际上就被埋没了。
    这次总结和推广郝建秀工作法的情形就和过去不同。这次市纺织工会总结和推广郝建秀工作法，曾得到中国纺织工会全国委员会、中共青岛市委员会的领导和华东纺织管理局青岛分局的大力支持，因此他们思想上非常重视郝建秀的创造。为了认真总结郝建秀的工作法，他们组织了郝建秀工作法研究委员会（包括工会干部、技术人员、优秀细纱工人），经过多次的测定、观察、分析研究，并学习了苏联的先进经验，最后才总结成功。接着又组织了推广组和检查组，到各厂进行推广和深入检查，推动运动不断地向前发展。这一期间，市纺织工会并指示各纺织厂的工会干部认真学习总结郝建秀工作法的经验，进一步去总结纺织工人的各种创造。各厂工会干部接受这个指示，先后在清花、梳棉、并条、粗纱、成包等各个棉纺织生产序列中总结出了具体运用郝建秀工作法的经验，使郝建秀工作法更广泛地推行起来。八月下旬，以市纺织工会为主组成的织布工作法研究委员会，又在七个国营棉纺织厂的织布场中，总结了江爱芝、魏秀英、孙秀贞等七个优秀工人的织布工作法；再用郭瓦廖夫综合先进经验的方法，把这七个工人织布工作法的优点，加以分析研究，综合成了一套比较科学的“自动织布机先进工作法”。这一工作法，对于最近全国织布工作法会议总结出来的“一九五一织布工作法”，极有贡献。
    通过对郝建秀工作法的推广，青岛市纺织工会和各厂工会已逐渐学会了发现、总结和推广先进经验。基层工会的工作空前活跃。市纺织工会生产部部长丁文自己也参加了自动织布机工作法研究委员会，每天在车间里观察、测定，晚上还和大家一起研究试行工作法的进展情况。他说：“过去我们不懂得如何面向生产，工作忙忙乱乱，有头无尾；现在能发现问题，总结和推广先进经验，工作有始有终，逐步深入提高，越干越有兴趣！”
    郝建秀工作法的推广，也推动了各厂的技术人员的进步。国营青岛第六棉纺织厂技师王尔骧在开始参加郝建秀工作法总结委员会时，还认为郝建秀每天仅少出五、六两皮辊花，至多也不过值一万、八千元吧，觉得这是“小题大作”。可是推广郝建秀工作法得到的良好效果，证明他以前的看法是错了。他后来学习和推广郝建秀工作法非常积极，并且成了一个很耐心的教师。过去有些技师到车间去走马观花、应付公事的现象，现在各厂也没有了。
