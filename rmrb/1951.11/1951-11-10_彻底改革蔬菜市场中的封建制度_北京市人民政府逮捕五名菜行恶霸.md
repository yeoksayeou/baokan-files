    Thoroughly Reform the Feudal System in the Vegetable Market
    Beijing Municipal People's Government Arrests Five Vegetable Market Bullies
    In order to thoroughly reform the feudal system in the vegetable market and eliminate the feudal bullies in the vegetable trade, the Beijing Municipal People's Government arrested five vegetable market bullies who were hated by the masses on the 5th of this month: Huang Lantian, Zhong Zihua, Zhang Heting, Shan Ruiguang, and Hu Dianfang.
    In the vegetable market, the "cai hang" (vegetable firms) and "tie zhu" (license holders) obtained "long tie" (dragon licenses) and "ya tie" (broker licenses) during the Qing Dynasty through tax farming or other means, monopolizing the vegetable business. After that, only "tie zhu" were allowed to open vegetable firms. In addition to obtaining high commissions when acting as agents for customers, vegetable firms often used illegal means such as manipulating small scales and arbitrarily setting prices to defraud and extort vegetable farmers, vegetable merchants, and vegetable vendors. Some vegetable firms even owed farmers money for extended periods. Vegetable firms manipulated vegetable prices, causing them to fluctuate frequently; hence the saying "A fast horse can't catch up with the vegetable market price." Before liberation, workers in the vegetable firms generally did not have fixed wages. The boss would give them some when he was happy, and nothing when he was not. This kind of wage was called "Sui Ye Shang" (the master's reward). At that time, workers were constantly in danger of being fired or beaten, and they had to swallow their anger. In order to oppress and exploit vegetable farmers, buyers, and general vegetable workers, the bullies in the vegetable firms also kept a group of hooligan thugs, such as "Iron Buddha," "Powerful Liu," "Seventh Emperor," "Southern Tyrant," and "Four Great Kongs." Zhang Dequan and Lin Wenhua, the special agent bullies of Tianqiao who have been executed, were famous vegetable bullies in the Tianqiao vegetable market.
    After the liberation of Beijing, the Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau carried out some reforms of the bad customs and practices in the various vegetable markets. These bullies tried in many ways to undermine these reasonable reforms. The broad masses have demanded that the government punish these feudal bullies who oppress the people.
    The big bully, Huang Lantian, was a hereditary "tie zhu," and served as the president of the Vegetable Industry Association from 1926 to June 1950. The three brothers, nicknamed "The Three Emperors Rule the World," ruled the vegetable market outside Fuchengmen for more than 20 years. During the Japanese puppet regime, he colluded with the Japanese Kenpeitai (military police); during the Kuomintang rule, he colluded with the 19th Regiment of Bandit Military Police and the puppet police station. Every day, he would write notes ordering each vegetable firm to deliver vegetables to those reactionary guys, and although everyone knew that the vegetables were given away for free, no one dared not to go. He controlled the vegetable market, manipulated vegetable prices, extorted commissions, and exploited both buyers and sellers. He also often extorted money from various vegetable firms in the name of the president. After liberation, he continued to act like a tyrant in the vegetable market, repeatedly undermining the government's policies and decrees, obstructing the Industry and Commerce Bureau's efforts to rectify the vegetable market and reduce commissions, and even organizing thugs to attack Wang Songshu and other workers who supported the reform of the feudal system. He also hid Kuomintang reactionary officers Zhang Chengyou, Liu Zhiqing, and others.
    The bully Zhong Zihua served as a puppet Baozhang (local security chief) during the Kuomintang rule, colluding with Kuomintang secret service agents and committing all kinds of evil deeds. He set up private courts, interrogated farmers, and seized farmers' property. He often carried a pistol and led puppet police to conscript soldiers and laborers for the Kuomintang. In the vegetable market, farmers had to give him water money and scale money to sell vegetables. He also used big scales to buy and small scales to sell. When he bought vegetables from farmers, he didn't rely on the scales, saying that however many pounds he said it was, that's what it was. So, a saying spread outside Zuo'anmen: "Not afraid of heaven, not afraid of earth, just afraid of one sentence from Zhong Zihua." After liberation, Zhong Zihua wooed village cadres, treating them to banquets and giving them money. Village cadres such as Lu Jingyuan were wavering in their stance and actually shielded this big bully. Zhong Zihua's arrogance was therefore very high, and he arbitrarily deducted money from vegetable farmers.
    Zhang Heting was a big bully who infiltrated the ranks of vegetable workers in the Guang'an market. In 1949, he fraudulently obtained the position of chairman of the Municipal Vegetable Industry Union, colluded with the feudal bully Huang Lantian, and opposed the government's decision to reform the vegetable market and reduce commissions. He used the name of the union chairman to extort money. During the Dragon Boat Festival, he forced each vegetable firm to give 50,000 yuan, which he and Huang Lantian split equally. He also abused the authority of the union chairman to undermine the union, forbidding genuine working-class vegetable workers from joining the union, but instead absorbing some capitalists into the union.
    The two bullies, Shan Ruiguang and Hu Dianfang, were two of the "Four Great Kongs" in the Guang'anmen market. They bullied vegetable workers and farmers, raped women, and seized property. Workers and farmers reflected: "We really hate them to the bone!" (Wang Jing, Shi Geng)

    彻底改革蔬菜市场中的封建制度
    北京市人民政府逮捕五名菜行恶霸
    北京市人民政府为彻底改革蔬菜市场中的封建制度，清除菜行中的封建恶霸，在本月五日，逮捕了为群众所痛恨的菜行大恶霸黄兰田、钟子华、张鹤亭、闪瑞光、胡殿芳等五人。
    菜市中的菜行、帖主，在满清时代，即用包税或其他办法，取得“龙帖”、“牙帖”，垄断把持菜业。此后，非“帖主”即不得开设菜行。菜行在代客成交时，除了取得较高的佣金外，还常常利用使小秤、任意作价等非法手段，欺诈勒索菜农、菜商、菜贩；有的菜行甚至欠了农民的账长期不还。菜行操纵菜价，蔬菜价格因而经常波动，所谓“快马赶不上菜行市”，就是这个道理。解放前，菜行中的工人一般的都没有固定的工资。掌柜的高兴时给一些，不高兴时就不给。这种工资叫做“随爷赏”。当时工人随时有被开除或遭殴打的危险，只得忍气吞声。菜行里的恶霸为了欺压盘剥菜农、买主和一般菜业工人，还豢养了一批流氓打手，如“铁佛爷”、“大力刘”、“七皇上”、“南霸天”、“四大金刚”等。已被枪决了的天桥特务恶霸张德泉和林文华，就是天桥菜市上著名的大菜霸。
    北京解放后，市人民政府工商局对各菜市的陋规恶习，进行了一些改革。这批恶霸多方破坏这种合理的改革。广大群众纷纷要求政府惩处这些欺压人民的封建恶霸。
    大恶霸黄兰田，是个世袭“帖主”，从一九二六年到一九五○年六月，一直充当菜业公会会长。他们兄弟三人，绰号“三皇治世”，统治阜城门外菜市场二十多年。日伪统治时，他勾结日本宪兵队；国民党统治时，他勾结匪宪兵十九团、伪警察局；他每天开条子叫各菜行给那些反动家伙送菜，虽然谁都知道菜送去是分文不给，但谁也不敢不去。他把持菜市，操纵菜价，勒索佣金，剥削买卖双方。他还常以会长名义，向各菜行勒索钱财。解放以后，他仍然在菜市里称王称霸，一再破坏政府的政策法令，阻挠工商局整顿菜市、减低佣金，还要组织打手，打击拥护改革封建制度的工人王松树等。他还隐藏了国民党反动军官张成佑、刘志清等。
    恶霸钟子华，在国民党统治时当伪保长，勾结军统特务，无恶不作。他私设公堂，审讯农民，霸占农民房产。他常常带着手枪，率领伪警察，给国民党抓兵拉夫。在菜市上，农民卖菜必得给他水钱、秤钱。他还用大秤入、小秤出。他买农民菜时，不凭秤，说多少斤就是多少斤。于是左安门外流传着一句话：“天不怕，地不怕，就怕钟子华一句话”。解放以后，钟子华拉拢村干部，请客、送钱，村干部卢景元等立场不稳，竟包庇了这个大恶霸。钟子华因此气焰很高，任意克扣菜农。
    张鹤亭是混进广安市场菜业工人队伍里的大恶霸。一九四九年，他骗取了市菜业工会主席的地位，和封建恶霸黄兰田勾结起来，反对政府改革菜市、减低佣金的决定。他利用工会主席的名义，敲诈钱财。在端午节，强迫各菜行每家拿五万元，他和黄兰田平分了。他还滥用工会主席的职权，破坏工会，不准菜业中的真正劳动工人参加工会，却吸收了一些资方入会。
    闪瑞光、胡殿芳两恶霸，是广安门市场“四大金刚”中的两大“金刚”。他们欺压菜业工人和菜农，强奸妇女，霸占财产。工人和菜农们反映说：“我们真恨透他们了！”    （王敬、石更）
