The Beijing Municipal People's Supervisory Committee, after the cases of Yang Deqing beating his wife Chen Shuying and Yu Wen et al. illegally detaining Ma Jingcheng et al., proposed handling opinions on the perpetrators and relevant personnel, and these were approved and implemented by the Beijing Municipal People's Government. The Beijing Municipal People's Supervisory Committee believes that Yang Deqing, as the head of a police station, brutally beat his wife, infringed on human rights, violated laws and regulations, and should be immediately dismissed and handed over to the People's Court for punishment according to law. Liu Hanchen, Director of the Public Security Bureau's Western Suburban Bureau, and Deputy Directors Wang Chishan and Li Quming failed to grasp the education of Yang Deqing's consistent beating of his wife and urge him to correct it, and should conduct a review. Yu Wen (female), a personnel section cadre of the Eastern Suburban Health Center of the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau, under the control of serious feudal ideas, abused her power, illegally detained Ma Jingcheng and Wang Lizhi, infringed on personal freedom, and deprived Ma Jingcheng of his political rights, which is a violation of laws and regulations, and should be immediately dismissed and sent to the People's Court for handling according to law. Li Wendou, chairman of the Eastern Suburban Health Center's trade union, participated in illegal activities and should be sent to the court for handling according to law. Lu Jingdai, director of the Eastern Suburban Health Center, as the leader of the center, neither stopped Yu Wen's illegal detention of Ma Jingcheng and Wang Lizhi nor reported it to the higher authorities, and should be given a demerit and conduct a review at the center's cadre meeting. In early October, Yu Wen had twice reported the situation of Ma Jingcheng and Li Huajie to the Personnel Section of the Public Health Bureau, and requested that Li Huajie be transferred to the Eastern Suburban Health Center for a struggle session. Bai Yan, the head of the Personnel Section of the Bureau, only pointed out that a struggle session could not be adopted, and did not immediately conduct an in-depth understanding of the situation. He was also unaware that Ma Jingcheng and Wang Lizhi had been illegally detained by Yu Wen. This is a concrete manifestation of bureaucratic work style and should be deeply reviewed.

The leading cadres of the Beijing Municipal People's Government fully agree with the handling opinions of the above-mentioned personnel and instructed the relevant departments to follow them.

    北京市人民政府
    批准市监察委员会意见
    予杨德庆等以撤职处分
  北京市人民监察委员会于杨德庆殴伤妻子陈淑英，郁文等非法拘禁马静承等二案发生后，对案犯及有关人员提出处理意见，并经北京市人民政府批准执行。北京市人民监察委员会认为，杨德庆身为派出所所长，野蛮地毒打妻子，侵犯人权，违法乱纪，应即撤职送交人民法院依法惩处。公安局西郊局长刘汉臣，副局长王赤山、李趣明对杨德庆一贯殴打妻子的错误行为未能抓紧教育，促其纠正，应进行检讨。北京市公共卫生局东郊卫生所人事科干事郁文（女）在严重的封建思想支配下，滥用职权，非法拘禁马静承、王立志，侵犯人身自由，并剥夺马静承的政治权利，实属违法乱纪，应即撤职送人民法院依法处理。东郊卫生所工会主席李文斗参与犯法行为，应送法院依法处理。东郊卫生所所长鲁景岱，身为该所领导人，对郁文非法拘禁马静承、王立志的行为，既不加以制止，也不向上级报告，应记过一次，并在该所干部大会上检讨。十月上旬郁文曾先后两次向公共卫生局人事科反映马静承与李华杰的情况，并要求把李华杰调到东郊卫生所开会斗争。该局人事科长白岩仅指出不能采取斗争方式，未即深入了解情况，及至马静承、王立志被郁文非法拘禁后，亦不知道。这是官僚主义作风的具体表现，应做深刻检讨。
    北京市人民政府领导干部完全同意对上述人员的处理意见，并指示有关部门遵照办理。
