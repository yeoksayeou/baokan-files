State-Owned Trading Companies in Northwest China Actively Improve Business Management; Over 9.6 Billion Yuan Saved in Commodity Circulation Costs in Second Quarter

State-owned trading companies in Northwest China are actively improving their business management, and commodity circulation costs are decreasing daily. According to incomplete statistics from the Northwest China Grain, Cotton Yarn and Cloth, General Merchandise, Native Produce, Tea, and Coal and Building Materials Companies, over 9.67 billion yuan was saved in commodity circulation costs in the second quarter of this year.

Due to the inconvenient transportation in Northwest China and high freight costs, saving transportation expenses has become one of the main items in reducing commodity circulation costs. In this regard, the state-owned trading companies in Northwest China have gained a lot of experience. For example, in the coal procurement work of the Northwest China Coal and Building Materials Company in the Tongchuan Mining Area, Shaanxi, the original purchasing station (which required horse-drawn carriage transportation from the mining area) located twenty miles away from the mining area was relocated to two market towns five and eleven miles away from the mining area. This shortened the horse-drawn carriage transportation route and increased the railway transportation mileage, thereby reducing coal transportation costs. As a result, the company saved more than 500 million yuan in transportation costs in the second quarter.

When the Northwest China Cotton Yarn and Cloth, General Merchandise, and Tea Companies ship goods from Xi'an to Lanzhou by truck, commodities that are not urgently needed are generally transported by horse-drawn carriage, reducing transportation costs by one-third. After adopting this method, the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company alone saved more than 900 million yuan in transportation costs in the second quarter.

The Lanzhou branch of the Northwest China Grain Company originally transported wheat from Jingning County to Lanzhou for processing into flour. Later, it was changed to process the wheat locally in Jingning and then transport the flour to Lanzhou. In May and June, the company processed 600,000 jin of wheat in Jingning, saving a total of 130 million yuan in transportation costs.

Some companies also tried to reduce the number of cargo loading and unloading operations and shorten unnecessary transshipment processes, thereby reducing cargo losses and saving a lot of loading and unloading costs. The Northwest China Coal and Building Materials Company adopted the "selling at the station" method, that is, when goods arrive at the sales location, they are sold or transferred to customers directly at the station, reducing the procedure of unloading and warehousing. By adopting this method, the company saved more than 140 million yuan in loading and unloading costs in the second quarter from the sale of timber alone.

    西北区各国营贸易公司积极改善经营管理
    第二季度节约商品流转费逾九十六亿元
    西北区各国营贸易公司积极改善经营管理，商品流转费用日渐减低。据西北区粮食、花纱布、百货、土产、茶叶、煤业建筑器材等六个公司不完整的统计，今年第二季度共节约商品流动费用九十六亿七千多万元。
    西北地区交通不便，货运费用很高，因此，节省运费就成了降低商品流转费用中的主要项目之一。在这方面，西北区各国营贸易公司曾取得不少经验。例如，西北区煤业建筑器材公司在陕西铜川矿区收购煤炭工作中，曾将原来设在离矿区二十里的收购站（自矿区到该站需用马车运输）改设到离矿区五里和十一里的两个集镇上，缩短了马车运输路线，增加了火车运输里程，煤炭运费因而减低，该公司第二季度因此共节省运费五亿多元。
    西北区花纱布、百货、茶叶三公司用汽车由西安往兰州发货时，一般不急需的商品都改由马车运输，运费减低三分之一；采用这个办法以后，仅花纱布公司第二季度就节省运费九亿多元。
    西北区粮食公司兰州分公司供应的面粉，原来都由静宁县运小麦往兰州加工，后来，改为在静宁就地加工后把面粉运到兰州。该公司五、六两月在静宁加工小麦六十万斤，共节省运费一亿三千万元。
    有些公司还设法减少货物装卸次数，缩短不必要的转运过程，因而减少了货物损耗，节省了不少装卸费用。西北区煤业建筑器材公司采用了“就站出售”的办法，即：货物到达销地时，就在车站出售或拨交顾主，减少了起卸入库这一道手续。由于采用这个办法，该公司在第二季度仅出售木材一项，就节省了一亿四千多万元的装卸费。
