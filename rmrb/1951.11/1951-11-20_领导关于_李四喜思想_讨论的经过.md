　　The discussion on "Li Sixi Thought" has been going on in Hunan for more than three months, and has gradually developed into a province-wide ideological criticism movement. In addition to Xin Hunan Bao, Dazhong Bao, Hunan Youth Daily, and the construction newspapers, Xiangzhong Bao, Binhu Daily, Zijiang Farmer's Daily, Yuenan People's Daily, Hengyang News, and Chenzhou Mass Daily of various special districts have successively launched discussions on "Li Sixi Thought". The Changsha Prefectural Committee and Changde Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, as well as many county committees, have issued instructions arranging for discussions on "Li Sixi Thought". The Changde, Chenzhou, and Lingling prefectural committees have focused on checking the ideological situation of rural cadres. Hanshou, Yiyang and more than a dozen other counties, when deploying the autumn grain collection, set aside time in cadre meetings to criticize "Li Sixi Thought" in order to correct the lax mood among cadres. The majority of farmers and the vast majority of rural cadres in the province believe that this issue is very important and raised appropriately, and they have expressed their opinions one after another. Therefore, Xin Hunan Bao alone has received more than 2,000 manuscripts and letters from all over the province. The discussion is most heated in areas where land reform has been completed.

　　Now, many farmers have begun to understand that "Li Sixi Thought" is wrong. Some farmers warn rural cadres who are not working hard in this way: "You are about to become Li Sixi!" Zhu Zhongli, deputy township chief of the Fifteenth Agricultural Yuxiang Township in Changsha County, resolutely resigned from his post in May and June of this year; later, in the movement to resist the US and aid Korea, after the persuasion and education of many people, he continued to work. After participating in this discussion and studying the history of the Party, his thinking changed. At the cadre meetings held by the district and county, he made a self-criticism, expressing that he would work hard. Liu Fubao, the township chief of Baoshi Township in Xiangyin County, had already packed his bedding and gone home in June of this year, but after participating in the discussion on "Li Sixi Thought" in his village, he carried his luggage back to the township government to work, expressing his determination to carry the revolution through to the end and never "make trouble". Fang Cuilou, the township chief of Public Security Township in Pingjiang County, originally did not want to continue working, but after participating in this discussion, he has settled down to work and improved his working methods, making his work very successful, making the township one of the best-performing townships in the whole district. These are just a few of the more prominent examples. In addition, many other rural cadres have also reversed their lax mood to varying degrees, expressing their willingness to continue working. Some have included overcoming "Li Sixi Thought" in their patriotic pacts, or written letters to Wang Shoudao, chairman of the Provincial People's Government, and the newspaper, expressing their determination to carry the revolution through to the end.

　　How was the discussion on "Li Sixi Thought" put forward?

　　After studying the current rural situation, we found that in areas where land reform has been completed, some farmers' associations are tending to disintegrate; rural cadres are in a relaxed mood, many people are "taking long vacations" to go home, and some are even privately handing over their work to others before going home; many militiamen have handed over their weapons to the farmers' association, saying, "The landlords have fallen, there is nothing to do!" This proves that the farmers' paralysis is quite serious. As a result, landlords and their lackeys took the opportunity to usurp rural power. In late April of this year, an armed riot by lawless landlords occurred in the Fifth District of Hanshou County. In May, the counter-revolutionaries lurking in the countryside were quite rampant, spreading rumors, poisoning, arson, and doing all kinds of evil. This situation has aroused the attention of all parties, and the newspapers have also been constantly sounding the alarm.

　　The People's Daily criticized the idea of "getting rich and planting cotton" in its June 1 editorial, "Respond to the State's Call to Launch a Cotton Selling and Storage Campaign." This made us begin to feel that Xin Hunan Bao had not fulfilled its due responsibility for the ideological education of farmers. Later, according to the instructions of higher authorities and the articles by Comrade Bo Yibo on "Strengthening the Party's Political Work in Rural Areas" and the People's Daily on "Strengthening the Ideological Nature of Newspaper Work," we conducted a review of our propaganda work, which made us pay more attention to the ideological education of farmers. Therefore, it was decided to organize a discussion on "Li Sixi Thought".

　　Initially, the discussion outline we sent to readers focused on exposing and criticizing "Li Sixi Thought," and did not make how to overcome "Li Sixi Thought" the focus of discussion. This approach was not comprehensive. Therefore, in the first ten days of the discussion, we were confused by certain trivial issues. After a period of exploration, we clearly realized that we should further discuss how to overcome "Li Sixi Thought" through the exposure and criticism of the essence of this thought, and clarify that the key to overcoming "Li Sixi Thought" lies in strengthening ideological leadership. Now, this discussion is being carried out according to the following requirements: 1. The main goal is to overcome the paralysis and lax thinking of rural cadres after the completion of land reform, strengthen their will to serve the people, and make them continue to work hard; 2. Promote local leading organs to attach importance to the political education of rural cadres and farmers, and check past leadership thinking and leadership methods; 3. Enable ordinary farmers to initially recognize the error of "Li Sixi Thought" and isolate "Li Sixi Thought" among the masses.

　　In the process of organizing this discussion, we encountered some ideological obstacles. For example, some people believe that Hunan has not been liberated for a long time, and the "decline" thought of rural cadres is an isolated phenomenon, not as serious as in the old areas. Some people believe that it is inevitable for rural cadres to have a relaxed and paralyzed mood, and there will always be this phenomenon after each central task is carried out. Some people believe that discussion is necessary, but it is impossible to carry out because the work is too busy at present. Another view is that the emergence of this thought is mainly due to the difficult lives of rural cadres. In summary, they are not very much in favor of this discussion, or at least it is not necessary to discuss it at present, but to wait and see. Some people also believe that discussion is necessary, but there is no need to discuss it for too long. At that time, due to the limitations of ideological level, we could not criticize these opinions, but were influenced by them, which showed hesitation. It was not until the second half of August—after the second month of the discussion—that the importance of criticizing and overcoming this wrong thought was emphasized at the first provincial propaganda conference when the issue of "Li Sixi Thought" was raised; after the meeting, Comrade Wang Shoudao wrote a paper on "Criticizing 'Li Sixi Thought' and Strengthening Cadre Ideological Education"; The People's Daily, Xinhua News Agency, Study Magazine, and Changjiang Daily also published and broadcast articles on the discussion of "Li Sixi Thought", which corrected the above-mentioned incorrect opinions and aroused the attention of various places to this discussion.

　　In the process of discussion, we have adopted the following methods: (1) Educating the masses with their own experiences. For example, citing many facts of counterattacks and settlements by illegal landlords to show that the completion of land reform is not "all right"; citing the facts of illegal landlords and counter-revolutionaries usurping rural power and undermining production to show that it is not possible to only care about production and not politics. (2) Publishing self-criticisms by cadres with "decline" thoughts or articles on the process of overcoming such wrong thoughts. (3) Commending cadres who serve the people wholeheartedly. (4) Discovering new problems and raising them for discussion in a timely manner, so as to deepen the discussion gradually. For example, we found that some rural cadres believe that "it is reasonable to take turns being a cadre." They said: "The ? guo (frog) jumps three times, it also has to take a breath!" "It should be like the Jia-leader in the Kuomintang era, rotating every six months, so as not to have one person suffer." We raised this idea for discussion, which deepened the discussion on "Li Sixi Thought". We also found that some leading cadres believe that the slack mood of rural cadres can be solved by "pressing tasks." We also raised this erroneous idea for discussion and gave it a severe criticism. (5) Organizing and publishing investigation materials on "Li Sixi Thought" from various parts of the province to promote the Party committees in various parts of the province to lead this discussion. A county's responsible cadre initially believed that the problem was not serious, saying that the rural cadres with "Li Sixi Thought" in the county accounted for at most 20% of the county's cadres. After investigation, it was found that cadres with "Li Sixi Thought" accounted for 70% of all cadres. As a result, the county paid attention to the discussion of this issue. In addition, the newspaper also made monthly summaries of the discussion.

　　However, as the editor's note of the "Party Life" column of the People's Daily on October 29 pointed out: "This discussion is not yet deep enough, because some cadres in some places do not have enough understanding of the long-term and arduous nature of educating farmers, and they think that 'there is no problem' after holding one or two discussion meetings. In some places, although the leading organs have made arrangements, they have not supervised and inspected, so this discussion has not been well developed. The Party organizations in these places should pay attention to overcoming certain shortcomings of formalism and deepen the discussion." We fully agree with this view and strive to change this situation through our propaganda work.

　　领导关于“李四喜思想”讨论的经过
    新湖南报编辑部
    关于“李四喜思想”的讨论，在湖南已进行了三个多月，现已逐渐形成为全省规模的思想批判运动。除新湖南报外，大众报、湖南青年报及各专区的建设报、湘中报、滨湖日报、资江农民报、岳南人民报、衡阳新闻、郴州群众报，都先后展开了关于“李四喜思想”的讨论。中共长沙地委、常德地委和许多县委都发出指示，布置了关于“李四喜思想”的讨论。常德、郴州、零陵等地委，有重点地检查了乡村干部的思想情况。汉寿、益阳等十余县在布置秋征的时候，都在干部会上抽出一定时间批判“李四喜思想”，以纠正干部中的松懈情绪。全省农民群众和绝大多数的农村干部都认为这个问题很重要，提得很恰当，纷纷表示意见。因此仅新湖南报就收到来自全省各地的稿件和信件有两千余件。全省以完成土地改革的地区讨论得最热烈。
    现在，许多农民已开始懂得“李四喜思想”是错误的。有的农民就这样来警告工作不力的乡村干部：“你快要当李四喜了！”长沙县十五农裕乡副乡长朱中立，今年五、六月间，坚决辞职不干；后来在抗美援朝运动中，经过许多人的说服教育，才继续工作下去。在参加了这个讨论，并学习了党史以后，他的思想转变了，在区、县召开的干部会上，作了自我检讨，表示要努力工作。湘阴县包市乡乡长刘福保，在今年六月已卷起铺盖回家，但在参加本村的关于“李四喜思想”的讨论后，又背起行李回到乡政府工作，表示坚决革命到底，再不“闹情绪”。平江县公安乡乡长方崔楼，本来不想继续工作的，而在参加这一讨论后，已经安心工作，并且改善了自己的工作方法，工作作得很有成绩，使该乡成为全区工作最好的一个乡。这不过是几个比较突出的例子。此外还有不少乡村干部也在不同程度上扭转了松懈情绪，表示要继续工作下去。有的把克服“李四喜思想”订在自己的爱国公约里，或写信给省人民政府王首道主席和报社，表示决心革命到底。
    关于“李四喜思想”的讨论是怎样提出来的呢？
    我们在研究了目前农村情况以后，发现在土地改革已经完成的地区，有部分农会组织趋于涣散；乡村干部情绪松弛，许多人“请长假”回家，有的甚至私自将工作交给别人就回家了；不少民兵则把武器交给农会，说“地主垮了，没有事啦！”足证农民的麻痹思想是相当严重的。因而地主及其狗腿子就趁机篡夺乡村政权。今年四月底，汉寿县五区曾发生不法地主武装暴乱的事件。五月间，潜伏在农村中的反革命分子相当猖狂，造谣、放毒、纵火，无恶不作。这种情况引起了各方面的重视，报上也不断发出警号。
    人民日报在六月一日“响应国家号召，开展售棉储棉运动”的社论中，批评了“要发家、种棉花”的思想。这使我们开始感到：新湖南报对农民的思想教育没有负起应有的责任。后来又根据上级的指示和薄一波同志“加强党在农村中的政治工作”和人民日报“加强报纸工作的思想性”等文章，对我们的宣传工作进行了检查，使我们进一步注意了对农民的思想教育。于是决定组织关于“李四喜思想”的讨论。
    最初，我们向读者发出的讨论提纲，偏重揭发批判“李四喜思想”，还没有把如何克服“李四喜思想”作为讨论的重点。这种提法是不全面的。因而在开始讨论的十几天中，我们曾被某些枝节问题所迷惑。经过一个时期的摸索，才明确认识应通过对这种思想实质的揭发与批判，进一步讨论如何克服“李四喜思想”，并弄清了克服“李四喜思想”的关键在于加强思想领导。现在，这个讨论是按照下列要求进行的：一、主要是克服乡村干部在土地改革以后产生的麻痹松懈思想，坚定他们为人民服务的意志，使他们继续努力工作；二、促使各地领导机关重视对乡村干部以及农民的政治教育，检查过去的领导思想和领导方法；三、使一般农民初步认识“李四喜思想”的错误，使“李四喜思想”在群众中孤立起来。
    我们在组织这一讨论的过程中，曾遇到一些思想障碍。例如：有些人认为湖南解放不久，乡村干部的“退坡”思想是个别现象，不如老区的严重。有些人认为乡村干部产生松懈麻痹情绪是必然的，每进行一项中心工作以后，总会有这种现象。有些人认为讨论固有必要，但目前工作太忙，无法进行。还有一种意见，认为这种思想的产生，主要是因为乡村干部生活困难。归结起来，都是不大赞成这个讨论，至少是目前不必讨论，等一等再说。也有人认为讨论是必要的，但不必讨论太久。当时由于思想水平的限制，我们还不能对这些意见进行批判，反受了它们的影响，以致表现了犹豫。直至八月下半月——讨论的第二个月以后，由于在全省第一次宣传会议上提出了关于“李四喜思想”的问题，中共湖南省委负责同志强调指出批判与克服这种错误思想的重要性；会后，王首道同志又写了“批判‘李四喜思想’，加强干部思想教育”的论文；人民日报、新华社、学习杂志、长江日报又都发表和广播了关于“李四喜思想”的讨论的文章，才纠正了上述不正确的意见，引起各地对这一讨论的重视。
    在讨论过程中，我们曾采用了以下方法：（一）以群众自己的经验教育群众。例如：举出许多不法地主反攻倒算的事实，以说明土地改革的完成，并没有“万事大吉”；举出不法地主及反革命分子篡夺乡村政权破坏生产的事实，以说明只顾生产、不问政治是不行的。（二）发表有“退坡”思想的干部的自我检讨或克服这种错误思想的经过的文章。（三）表扬全心全意为人民服务的干部。（四）发现新问题，及时提出讨论，以使讨论逐步深入。例如：我们曾发现有些乡村干部认为“轮流当干部是合理的”。他们说：“?蝈（青蛙）跳三跳，也要歇下气！”“应该像国民党时代的甲长一样，六个月轮一次，免得一个人吃亏。”我们就把这种思想提出来讨论，这就使关于“李四喜思想”的讨论深入了一步。我们又发现有些领导干部认为：乡村干部的松懈情绪用“压任务”的方法可以解决。对于这种错误思想，我们也提出来讨论，并给了它以严厉的批判。（五）组织与发表本省各地关于“李四喜思想”的调查材料，推动全省各地党委领导这个讨论。有一位县的负责干部最初认为问题不严重，说该县有“李四喜思想”的乡村干部，最多占全县干部百分之二十。经调查后，发现有“李四喜思想”的干部竟占全体干部的百分之七十。这一来，该县也就注意了对这个问题的讨论。此外，报上还每月作讨论小结。
    但是，正如人民日报十月二十九日“党的生活”栏编者按语所指出的：“这一讨论目前还不够深入，这是因为有些地方的干部对教育农民的长期性和艰苦性认识不足，开过一两次讨论会就以为‘没有问题了’。有的地方，领导机关虽作了布置，但未督促检查，因此，这一讨论也未能很好地展开。这些地方的党组织应注意克服某些形式主义的缺点，把讨论深入一步。”我们完全同意这一意见，并努力经过我们的宣传工作来改变这种状况。
