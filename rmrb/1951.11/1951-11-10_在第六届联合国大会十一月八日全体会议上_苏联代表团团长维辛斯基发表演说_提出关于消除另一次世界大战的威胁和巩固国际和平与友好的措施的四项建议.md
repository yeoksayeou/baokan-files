Xinhua News Agency, Paris, November 9th: The Sixth UN General Assembly held a plenary session on the morning of November 8th to begin general discussions. Representatives from Brazil, the Netherlands, and the United States delivered speeches.

The morning session adjourned after the speech by the head of the American delegation, Acheson.

At the afternoon session, the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, delivered a lengthy speech.

The delegates attending the meeting, journalists, and many guests were extremely concerned and awaited Vyshinsky's speech. Long before the start of the meeting, the meeting hall was full. When Vyshinsky appeared on the podium, the applause was prolonged. The Soviet representative's speech received focused attention from the entire audience and was repeatedly interrupted by applause.

Vyshinsky said: The Soviet delegation, now as in previous sessions, believes that its task remains to guide the General Assembly to eliminate the obstacles that hinder the consolidation of peace and international cooperation, and to eliminate the threat of another world war. At present, this is the most important and primary task that requires the United Nations to take immediate decisions.

Vyshinsky analyzed in detail the activities of the United Nations in the past period and convincingly proved that, due to the policies of the aggressive core group of the United Kingdom and the United States within the United Nations, the United Nations organization is becoming an organization that satisfies the needs of American aggressors.

Vyshinsky pointed out that the Soviet Union's foreign policy—a policy of peace—is the exact opposite of the United States' aggressive foreign policy. He said: The goal of the Soviet Union's efforts is to practically eliminate the danger of another world war and to consolidate peace.

Vyshinsky said: The sinister conspiracies of the instigators of another world war are plunging the world into a dangerous situation. At present, active efforts are especially needed to extricate the world from this dangerous situation. Vyshinsky pointed out that the three-nation (US, UK, and France) proposal announced by Acheson in his speech, as well as Truman's radio address on November 7th, were attempts to replace the need to eliminate the threat of another world war with empty talk of so-called disarmament. Vyshinsky pointed out that this proposal "makes a lot of noise but produces little rain."

Finally, Vyshinsky announced: On behalf of the Soviet government, in order to consolidate international peace and security and eliminate the threat of war, the following recommendations are submitted to the General Assembly for consideration:

"On measures to eliminate the threat of another world war and consolidate international peace and friendship.

(1) The General Assembly declares that participation in the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization is incompatible with membership in the United Nations; the establishment of land, sea, and air bases in foreign territories by certain countries, mainly the United States, is also incompatible with membership in the United Nations.

(2) The General Assembly considers it necessary:

	A. That all parties participating in the hostilities in Korea immediately cease fire, conclude an armistice agreement, and withdraw their troops from the 38th parallel within ten days.

	B. That all foreign troops and foreign volunteer forces withdraw from Korea within three months.

(3) The General Assembly requests all countries, whether members of the United Nations or governments not yet participating in the United Nations, to hold a world conference to study the issues of massive reductions in armies and armaments, as well as the prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of international control to supervise the implementation of this prohibition.

The General Assembly also recommends that the aforementioned world conference should be convened as soon as possible, in any case no later than June 1, 1952.

(4) The General Assembly requests the United States, the United Kingdom, France, China, and the Soviet Union to conclude a peace pact and work together to achieve this lofty goal.

The General Assembly also requests all other peace-loving countries to participate in the peace pact."

When presenting these recommendations, Vyshinsky expressed the hope that they would receive the support of all countries committed to peace and all peace-loving people.

After Vyshinsky finished his speech, the meeting adjourned.

    在第六届联合国大会十一月八日全体会议上
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基发表演说
    提出关于消除另一次世界大战的威胁和巩固国际和平与友好的措施的四项建议
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社巴黎九日讯：第六届联合国大会于十一月八日上午举行全体会议，开始进行一般讨论。巴西、荷兰、与美国的代表发表演说。
    上午会议在美国代表团团长艾奇逊演说完毕后休会。
    在下午会议上，苏联代表团团长维辛斯基发表长篇演说。
    参加会议的代表、新闻记者、许多来宾都极为关心地等待维辛斯基发表演说。在开会以前很久，会议厅中便已满座。维辛斯基在讲坛上出现时，掌声经久不息。这位苏联代表的演说得到全场的专注倾听，并且一再被掌声所打断。
    维辛斯基说：苏联代表团现在和在前几届会议上一样，认为它的任务仍是引导大会去消灭那些妨碍巩固和平与国际合作的种种障碍，消除另一次世界大战的威胁。在目前，这是最重大的、首要的工作，须要联合国方面立即采取决定。
    维辛斯基详尽分析联合国在过去这一时期的活动，并且令人信服地证明：由于联合国内的侵略核心英美集团的政策，联合国组织正在变成满足美国侵略者的需要的组织。
    维辛斯基指出，苏联的外交政策——和平政策和美国的侵略性外交政策恰恰相反。他说：苏联的努力目标在实际消除另一次大战的危险与巩固和平。
    维辛斯基说：另一次世界大战的煽动者的罪恶阴谋正使世界陷入危险的局势。目前，特别需要积极的努力，使世界脱离这种危险局势。维辛斯基指出，艾奇逊在其演说中公布的三国（美、英、法）建议以及杜鲁门十一月七日的广播演说都是企图以所谓裁减军备的空谈来代替以行动消除另一次大战的威胁的需要。维辛斯基指出，这个建议“雷声大雨点小”。
    最后，维辛斯基宣布：奉苏联政府之命，为了巩固国际和平与安全并消除战争的威胁，提出下列建议供大会考虑：
    “关于消除另一次世界大战的威胁和巩固国际和平与友好的措施。
    （一）大会宣告：参加侵略性的北大西洋集团是和联合国会员国的资格不相容的；某些国家，主要是美国，在外国领土上建立陆、海、空军基地的行为，也是和联合国会员国的资格不相容的。
    （二）大会认为必须：
    甲、朝鲜境内敌对行动的参与各方立即停火，缔结停战协定，并在十天以内把他们的军队撤离三十八度线。
    乙、一切外国军队以及外国志愿部队在三个月内撤出朝鲜。
    （三）大会要求一切国家，不论是联合国会员国或是目前尚未参加联合国的国家的政府，举行世界会议，研究大量裁减军队和军备的问题，以及禁止原子武器和建立国际管制以监督这一禁令的执行的实际措施。
    大会并建议上述世界会议应尽早召开，无论如何不迟于一九五二年六月一日。
    （四）大会要求美国、英国、法国、中国和苏联缔结和平公约，共同努力，以求达到这个崇高的目标。
    大会并要求其他一切爱好和平的国家参加和平公约。”
    维辛斯基提出这些建议时，表示希望这些建议获得一切致力于和平的国家以及所有爱好和平的人民的支持。
    维辛斯基发言完毕之后，会议即告休会。
