Xinhua News Agency, December 12th Dispatch from Tokyo: The so-called "Matsukawa Incident," fabricated by American and Japanese reactionaries to persecute patriotic Japanese workers, began its second trial on October 23rd at the Sendai High Court in Japan. Prior to this, Tatsuji Fuse, Chairman of the Japan Labor-Farmer Relief Society, issued an appeal to peace-loving people around the world, calling on them to support the Japanese people's just struggle against the persecution of innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident." The appeal stated: In the first trial of the "Matsukawa Incident," the entire court proceedings completely proved that all the defendants were innocent. However, the Japanese judges completely lost their national self-esteem and conscience, and became irrational butchers. In order to please the masters they served in Japan, they followed the latter's instructions and sentenced five of the innocent defendants to death. The appeal pointed out: In view of Japan's re-militarization, we believe that the death sentences of innocent defendants are not only a humanitarian issue, but also involve a more significant issue of world peace. The appeal concluded: Therefore, we sincerely hope that people all over the world will help us bring the truth of the "Matsukawa Incident" to light and clarify the responsibility for this frame-up, so that the authorities can no longer use this incident as an excuse to further strengthen domestic repression and plunge Japan into the adventure of war again.

    呼吁全世界和平人民
    支援“松川事件”被告
    【新华社十二日讯】东京迟到消息：美、日反动派为了迫害日本爱国工人而制造的所谓“松川事件”，已自十月二十三日开始在日本仙台高等裁判所举行第二审。在此以前，日本劳农救援会主席布施辰治曾发表致世界爱好和平人民的呼吁书，向世界人民呼吁支援日本人民反对迫害“松川事件”无辜被告的正义斗争。呼吁书说：在“松川事件”的第一审中，整个开庭的过程完全证明所有被告都是无罪的。但是，日本法官完全丧失了民族自尊心和良心，变成了没有理智的屠夫。他们为了讨好他们所侍奉的日本的主宰者，便遵照后者的指示，对无辜被告中的五人宣判死刑。呼吁书指出：鉴于日本的重新军国主义化，我们认为，对无辜被告的死刑判决，不仅是一个人道问题，而且也涉及了更重大的世界和平问题。呼吁书最后说：因此，我们诚恳地希望全世界人民帮助我们将“松川事件”的真相公诸光天化日之下，并弄清楚这一诬陷事件的责任，使当局不能再利用这个事件为藉口，进一步加强国内的镇压措施，并把日本再度投入战争的冒险中。
