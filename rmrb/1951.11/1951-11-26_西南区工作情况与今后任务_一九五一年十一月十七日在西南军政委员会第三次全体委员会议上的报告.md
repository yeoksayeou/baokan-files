In the past nine months and more, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, we have followed the work tasks and various resolutions decided by the Second Plenary Session of this committee, and have carried out various tasks, all of which have achieved new accomplishments and victories.

    Tibet has been peacefully liberated, and the entire Chinese mainland has achieved a unity unprecedented in history. The People's Liberation Army's troops entering Tibet, with the support of the people of the Northwest and Southwest and the Tibetan compatriots, have victoriously reached Lhasa, and have been warmly welcomed and supported by the Tibetan local government headed by the Dalai Lama and people from all walks of life, demonstrating the victory of the great unity of all ethnic groups in China. This not only shattered the imperialist aggression plot, but also laid the foundation for consolidating the western border defense.

    The movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend Our Homes and Country has been widely developed in various parts of the Southwest. The vast majority of people in the region, including all ethnic groups, democratic parties, democratic classes, and people of all religious beliefs, accounting for about 80 percent of the urban population and 60 percent of the rural population, have participated in this great patriotic movement and received patriotic education in resisting America and aiding Korea. More than 26.4 million people participated in demonstrations to resist America, aid Korea, oppose the arming of Japan, and defend world peace. The number of people who voted against the United States arming Japan exceeded 42.5 million, and the number of people who signed petitions requesting the conclusion of a five-power peace pact was over 45.5 million. In response to the call of the China People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, people from all walks of life, based on patriotic production increases, have pledged to donate 209 airplanes, 19 artillery pieces, and 12 anti-aircraft guns. Most areas have already completed and exceeded their payment tasks. In the large and medium-sized cities of the region, 80 to 90 percent of the people, and in the rural areas, about 70 percent of the people, have signed patriotic covenants. The great movement to resist America and aid Korea has greatly promoted all kinds of work, and people of all strata have become more widely united, raised their political awareness, basically destroyed the erroneous ideas of admiring, worshiping, and fearing the United States, and enhanced national self-confidence and national self-esteem, feeling the glory of being Chinese people. However, judging from the situation of the movement, there are still many blank spots where patriotic education in resisting America and aiding Korea has not been received, and patriotic covenants are more of a formality. This is worth noting.

    Land reform has been completed in two phases. Areas where land distribution has been completed include 172 counties (including 71 whole counties), 8 cities, a total of 4,412 townships, with a total population of more than 37 million. Because the land reform movement was launched on the basis of a series of struggles such as clearing bandits, opposing local bullies, reducing rent and returning deposits, and punishing illegal landlords, and because the correct line of relying on poor peasants and farm laborers, uniting middle peasants, neutralizing rich peasants, and eliminating feudalism was implemented in the movement, the movement was led, step-by-step, and orderly. The development was normal, and with the continuous accumulation of experience, the work was done more solidly and carefully in each phase, and the mobilization of the masses was more thorough and in-depth. According to current estimates, in about 20 percent of the land reform areas, the work is not thorough enough, and the mobilization of poor peasants and farm laborers is not sufficient. In the places where land reform has been completed, among some cadres and peasant activists, a kind of "change of shift" and "relaxation" mentality is beginning to sprout, so that unlawful landlords can take the opportunity to counterattack and plot sabotage. These phenomena must be remedied and corrected in future work.

    Since last winter, the Southwest region, relying on the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people, has launched a vigorous movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, forming a mass movement upsurge with leadership and order that is unprecedented in history. Because the movement was carried out on the basis of the increased political awareness of the masses, because all democratic parties, people's organizations, and people from all walks of life enthusiastically supported and participated in the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries, and because of the efforts of people's governments at all levels and public security, procuratorate, court, and judicial organs, the counter-revolutionary forces have been severely hit in most parts of the region. The masses applauded and shouted, "The People's Government has law and heaven," which greatly improved the political enthusiasm of the people, social order was unprecedentedly stable, and the people's power was more consolidated. However, the scope of the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries and the degree of mass mobilization are still unbalanced. Some areas have not been suppressed thoroughly enough, and the masses have not been mobilized, or the mobilization is not sufficient. There are still a few areas and certain aspects where counter-revolutionaries have not yet begun to be suppressed, and the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries needs to be thoroughly implemented in the future.

    Prices continue to remain stable, and industry and commerce and agriculture have seen significant recovery and partial development. Public and private industries have also undergone preliminary democratic reforms. Under the policy of "relying on workers, uniting employees, and doing a good job in production," workers' labor enthusiasm and sense of ownership have greatly increased, and production has gradually increased. Because we vigorously organized and led the sale of local products, organized urban and rural exchanges, and planned processing and ordering, coupled with the increase in people's purchasing power after land reform, urban industry and commerce have now shown a good trend of "the off-season is not weak, and the peak season is even stronger." With the efforts of all employees and the enthusiastic support of the people of the Southwest, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway will be laid to Neijiang by the end of this year, and the Chongqing-Rongchang section has been opened to traffic. In terms of agricultural production, this year's harvest is better, and the farmers' production enthusiasm is extremely high after turning over. This year's grain output has increased by nearly 2 percent compared with last year. The output of industrial raw material crops has mostly exceeded last year, and cotton has exceeded the pre-war level. In terms of water conservancy, the paddy fields increased by 2 million mu due to the restoration and construction of ponds, weirs and small-scale water conservancy, which is more than double the original plan. These are some of our achievements in industry and agriculture. However, in the context of the development of industry and agriculture, a series of new problems and new difficulties have emerged, such as the difficulty of market expansion and insufficient products; the difficulty that democratic reforms in industrial and mining enterprises are not enough to meet the great patriotic production increase task; the difficulty of fertilizer in agriculture and the lack of means of production and means of livelihood that still exist among poor peasants and farm laborers after land reform, etc., all of which require us to carry out a series of work to properly resolve them.

    In terms of cultural and educational work, combined with the development of the three major movements of resisting America and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, people's political awareness has been significantly improved. Also, due to the efforts of cultural and educational workers, a wide range of organized anti-imperialist and anti-feudal ideological education and ideological struggle has been launched among the people, and the movement to criticize various erroneous ideas has begun, promoting the patriotic movement and anti-imperialist and anti-feudal ideological struggle of people from all walks of life. In terms of school education, some unnecessary chaotic situations have been ended, and the enthusiasm of teachers and students has been greatly improved. But it is undeniable that in the fundamental work of ideological remolding, we are far behind other parts of the country, and the education in schools is progressing even slower than other aspects of cultural and educational work. Overcoming this situation depends on future efforts.

    Work on ethnic minorities has taken another step forward. More than 150 ethnic autonomous regions and ethnic joint regimes have been established throughout the region. Tens of thousands of ethnic minority cadres have participated in the work, and they are still being trained in large numbers. In addition, in terms of economy and trade, we have adopted a policy of supporting development, vigorously purchasing local products and supplying daily necessities, thus gradually improving the lives of ethnic minority compatriots. Much work has also been done in culture, education, medicine and health. This has greatly improved ethnic relations and strengthened unity. Compatriots in various ethnic minority areas have enthusiastically responded to various calls from the People's Government. Tibetan compatriots in Xikang actively supported the troops entering Tibet, and Yi compatriots in Liangshan voluntarily captured nearly a thousand bandits and secret agents. These are the best proofs.

    The achievement of these results has enabled our work in the region to take another step forward and put our work on the right track. In order to further promote achievements and enable the work in the Southwest to catch up with other parts of the country, so as to meet the arduous tasks of striving for the final victory in the struggle to resist America and aid Korea and national construction, we should follow Chairman Mao's instructions and the spirit of the Third Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, combined with the current actual situation in the Southwest, and focus on doing the following main tasks well:

    (1) Launch a patriotic movement to increase production and practice economy. The great struggle to resist America and aid Korea is still going on. In order to continue to adhere to this just and victorious struggle, we need to continue to strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, and we need to "increase production, practice strict economy, in order to support the Chinese People's Volunteers" (Chairman Mao). Launching a broad mass movement to increase production and practice economy is a powerful guarantee for winning the struggle to resist America and aid Korea, and it is a fundamental policy for accelerating national construction. It can not only ensure the continued stability of the market and the stability of the people's lives, but also establish and promote the traditional atmosphere of diligence, thrift, hard work and struggle of our people. It should be pointed out that at present, we have many shortcomings in production, and the phenomenon of waste and extravagance is serious. We must conduct inspections in all aspects, formulate plans to increase production and practice economy, and vigorously implement them.

    In industrial and mining enterprises, we should educate and unite all workers, technicians and employees, further improve the utilization rate of equipment, strengthen the inspection, maintenance and safety work of machinery, strengthen technical management and capital management, save funds, save raw materials, reduce waste materials, reduce costs, improve product quality, and overcome the phenomenon of using large materials for small purposes and using good materials for inferior purposes. When carrying out basic construction work, we must strictly conduct surveys, designs, and construction in accordance with the basic construction procedures, strengthen the inspection of the construction site, and correct the serious waste and corruption in basic construction by strictly controlling and restricting the construction plan. All leading cadres of industrial and mining enterprises must conscientiously implement democratic management in the enterprise, fully mobilize the enthusiasm of workers, technicians and employees, and turn the plans of the departments, bureaus, factories, and mines into mass actions of workshops and groups. Each workshop or group should formulate a plan to increase production and practice economy based on the results of detailed inspection. All workers, technicians and employees should raise their political vigilance, prevent hidden special agents and reactionaries from carrying out technical sabotage, and at the same time establish a strict responsibility system to reduce responsibility accidents to a minimum.

    In agriculture, it is required to increase production by 5 percent in 1952 according to normal yields, at least not lower than this year's level. To this end, it is necessary to: vigorously promote the construction of ponds and weirs and develop small-scale water conservancy; promote afforestation and strictly pay attention to preventing drought; promote the raising of livestock (especially pigs) to increase fertilizer, prohibit the slaughter of cattle, improve feeding methods to reduce livestock deaths; in rural areas that have undergone land reform, establish cooperatives with emphasis and planning, and promote peasants to establish and develop temporary or permanent mutual aid groups of various kinds on the basis of the inherent mutual aid and cooperation organizations in rural areas, in order to achieve the practical results of organizing, overcoming difficulties, and increasing production. In view of the situation that food is still insufficient, the area of various economic crops should not be blindly expanded, but should achieve the purpose of increasing production by improving varieties and paying attention to cultivation techniques to increase the yield per mu. In addition, in rural areas, we should also promote thrift and prepare for famine, and the phenomenon of eating and drinking that has occurred in individual places should be corrected.

    In forestry, we must strictly correct the serious waste of materials in logging work, combine the logging plan with the task of afforestation and forest protection, and prevent landlords from stealing and selling trees.

    In terms of finance, grain and trade, we should strengthen business learning, improve and improve operating capabilities, accelerate capital turnover, reduce commodity circulation costs, overcome waste in institutions, settings, transportation, and storage, and better serve the country's industrial and agricultural construction. All tax collectors and industrialists and businessmen should further promote patriotic enthusiasm to a higher degree and ensure the completion of tax revenue tasks.

    All workers in the organs should implement the task of increasing production and practicing economy into every small event, oppose the work style of extravagance, wastefulness, and impracticality, overcome red tape and bureaucracy in the work, tighten and merge overlapping institutions, reduce unnecessary personnel, and strive to save national expenditures and improve work efficiency.

    The patriotic movement to increase production and practice economy is the central task of the people of the whole country, and it is also the central task of our people in the Southwest. All the people in the Southwest must be mobilized and take it as the main content of the patriotic covenants to be formulated and revised by all factories, mines, enterprises, all organs, and all people from all walks of life, and conscientiously implement it into action.

    (2) Accelerate the completion of land reform. The third phase of land reform in the entire region has already begun. Based on our subjective ability, we should strive to complete the task of land reform throughout the region by the end of 1952, except for ethnic minority areas where land reform should not be carried out. Sichuan and Xikang provinces should all strive to basically complete this task before the spring plowing next year. The work of distributing and handling mountains and forests should also be completed at the same time before the end of next year. All areas that have completed land reform should, without exception, implement a "review" movement. The content of the review movement includes the following:

    (1) Handle outstanding issues, further mobilize the masses, and make up lessons for about 20 percent of the villages where the work is not good; (2) Evaluate good yields and lay a solid foundation for agricultural tax; (3) Issue land certificates. After these review work, farmers can greatly improve their enthusiasm for production on the basis of determining land rights and evaluating good yields. In areas where land reform was completed before this autumn, in addition to distributing and handling mountains and forests and carrying out review work, we should also actively lead winter production, open a large number of training classes for rural activists, further improve their political awareness, overcome the "change of shift" and "relaxation" thinking, to prevent the landlord's counterattack, and through this group of activists, organize all farmers to carry out the three basic tasks of production, education and democratic governance for a long time.

    (3) Conscientiously carry out democratic reforms in industrial and mining enterprises and industries. The prerequisite for changing the old enterprises serving imperialism, feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism left over from the old society into new enterprises suitable for the needs of the new democratic economy of the people lies in the implementation of democratic reforms in industrial and mining enterprises and even industries. The basic policy of democratic reform is "relying on workers, uniting employees, and doing a good job in production", and its main content is the democratization of management and the rationalization of production. Through democratic reform, on the one hand, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses, inspire the sense of ownership of workers, technicians and employees, eliminate all hidden special agents and sabotage elements and feudal bosses in industrial and mining enterprises and industries, and implement democratic management on the basis of mass awareness, changing the face of industrial and mining enterprises. On the other hand, on the basis of the democratic movement, establish various production management systems to achieve the purpose of increasing production and practicing economy. In this regard, we have carried out preliminary work and have begun to achieve some results. Experience has proved that no matter public or private enterprises, as long as this policy is implemented, the workers' production enthusiasm will be greatly improved, all unreasonable phenomena can be corrected, and hidden saboteurs will be gradually exposed, thereby improving organizational leadership, reducing accidents, and increasing production. But it must be pointed out that the democratic reforms of our state-owned industrial and mining enterprises are only just beginning, and most of those that have begun are also extremely incomplete. In private enterprises, except for individual factories and mines, they generally have not yet recognized the importance of democratic reforms and have not yet made up their minds to conscientiously implement democratic reforms. Especially in important industries such as construction, transportation, docks, and wooden boats, except for a few, no reform has been carried out, which has greatly affected the national economy and the people's livelihood and hindered the development of the public and private economies. In these public and private enterprises that have not been reformed or have not been thoroughly reformed, the workers have not been mobilized or have not been mobilized enough, and the feudal bosses and the old unreasonable management system are still pressing on the workers' heads, the organs are bloated, redundant personnel are filled, and the phenomena of corruption and waste are serious, and the activities of counter-revolutionaries cannot be exposed, resulting in accidents one after another. For example, many state-owned factories have continuously experienced political accidents of technical sabotage, the boiler explosion of the Minjiang Power Plant in southern Sichuan, and the warehouse fire of the Shashi Yarn Factory in Chongqing, all of which have caused huge losses to the property of the state and the people. Therefore, in the future, we must focus on state-owned industrial and mining enterprises and important industries, and conscientiously carry out democratic reforms. At the same time, persuade and encourage the capitalists to consciously carry out reforms on the basis of labor-capital consultation. So that the existing public and private equipment capacity of the country can be fully utilized to overcome the current weakness of insufficient production, and fulfill its responsibilities in the glorious political task of increasing production patriotically and supporting the People's Volunteers.

    (4) Continue to deepen the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries. Since last winter, the entire Southwest region has carried out a large-scale mass movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, achieved great victories, and given the counter-revolutionaries a serious blow. However, in past movements, only those enemies who have been exposed or are relatively easy to find have been hit more thoroughly, while those hidden counter-revolutionaries hidden inside the people, especially the secret and behind-the-scenes organizers, have not been hit hard enough. At the same time, there are still areas, parts and aspects that have not been thoroughly hit or have not been moved at all. Among our general cadres and people, we often hate those exposed counter-revolutionaries or those who have suffered direct harm from them, but we are often easily lose vigilance against those hidden counter-revolutionaries who are actually more harmful and dangerous. Therefore, we cannot be satisfied with the existing achievements, nor can we be arrogant because of victory, so that we lose our revolutionary vigilance. Since we understand that the enemy will not relax their counter-revolutionary sabotage activities for a minute, we must continue to deepen the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries under the policy of consolidating existing victories and developing victories. All areas, parts or aspects that have not been thoroughly suppressed or have not been moved at all should be thoroughly suppressed on the basis of widespread and in-depth mobilization of the masses in coordination with the central work. In places where the suppression has been relatively thorough in the past, we should continue to discover those more deeply hidden secret agent sabotage elements, and always be vigilant against them using more clever methods to carry out various kinds of sabotage activities. For secret agent reactionary elements mixed into organs, schools, industrial and mining enterprises, we should especially mobilize the masses and, through meticulous investigation work, discover and punish them. For existing prisoners, we should implement the policy of "labor reform", which is an important means to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements by forced labor, and is also a basic policy to thoroughly transform prisoners into new people. For general counter-revolutionary elements who are distributed to the masses for control, we should implement a policy of combining administrative control with mass supervision, combining ideological education with labor reform, and, depending on the degree of repentance, deal with them according to the circumstances after a certain period of time, or increase their punishment, or cancel their control, to encourage the majority to be brave in reforming and becoming new people. For the families of counter-revolutionary elements, we should carry out the work of striving for and educating them, and not treat them as counter-revolutionary elements, and make them understand the crimes of the counter-revolutionary elements and support the correct measures of the People's Government to severely suppress counter-revolutionaries.

    (5) Cultural and educational aspects. Chairman Mao instructed us in his opening remarks at the recent CPPCC meeting: "Ideological remolding, especially the ideological remolding of intellectuals, is one of the important conditions for our country to thoroughly realize democratic reforms and gradually implement industrialization in all aspects." At the same time, this CPPCC meeting also stipulated in the resolution that "a widespread ideological remolding movement should be launched, and a systematic learning movement of Mao Zedong Thought, which combines Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution, should be organized." In this regard, although we have carried out some work in combination with the three major movements of resisting America and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and have achieved certain results, we should not overestimate these results, but should think that this is still our weakest link. For example, recently some schools, after correcting the tendency of only engaging in sports and neglecting studies, have grown another tendency of only engaging in studies and despising politics. Some people think that as long as they "learn mathematics, physics and chemistry, they are not afraid to go anywhere in the world", and even individual teachers persuade students not to go to state-owned factories for internships, and individual students think that participating in the National Day parade also hinders learning and are unwilling to participate in various political activities. The discussion about "The Life of Wu Xun" and "The Tale of Rebirth" has not been widely carried out in cultural and educational circles and among various intellectuals. Especially in some middle schools, the ideology is even more confused, and there are even those who are still advocating the "Spirit of Wu Xun" and spreading reactionary ideas. Although these phenomena are individual and relatively prominent examples, their seriousness lies in the fact that they have not aroused the due attention of the intellectual community, and have not even been criticized as they should be, and have been allowed to spread, which is very dangerous. This shows that the old school education cause is to separate theory from practice. If it is not reformed under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, it is difficult to adapt to the needs of the current national defense construction and economic construction. Therefore, we must resolutely respond to the call of Chairman Mao and the National Committee of the CPPCC, widely launch an ideological remolding movement in educational circles, cultural circles and among various intellectuals in the Southwest, systematically study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, which combines with the practice of the Chinese revolution, use the method of criticism and self-criticism, eliminate the influence of the reactionary ideas of imperialism and feudalism, criticize various erroneous ideas that violate the interests of the people, and establish the new democratic "theory and practice unity" teaching policy to adapt to the needs of national construction. Primary school teachers in various places should establish primary school teachers' federations, participate in this movement, work hard to transform and improve themselves, and establish the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly. Schools at all levels must continue to deepen the patriotic education of resisting America and aiding Korea. In rural areas after land reform, the winter school movement must be widely carried out. Strengthen the patriotic education of current affairs politics and increasing production and practicing economy among the broad masses of workers and peasants.

    (6) Work on ethnic minorities. We must adhere to the policy of prudence and stability to advance the work of ethnic unity. According to past experience, through the people's representative conferences of all ethnic groups, the establishment of ethnic democratic regional autonomous governments in ethnic minority areas and the establishment of ethnic democratic joint governments in mixed areas not only conform to the ethnic policies in the Common Program, but also an important key to promoting democracy and uniting all ethnic groups. At the same time, it is necessary to provide assistance to various fraternal ethnic groups in terms of economy, trade, culture, education, and health. We have already done a lot of work in this regard, and in the future, we should take more and more effective methods to make more achievements. To adapt to the development of the above tasks, we must also pay attention to the training of ethnic minority cadres, strengthen the work of ethnic minority colleges, and open short-term or temporary training classes with varying numbers of people to train a large number of cadres from various ethnic groups to meet urgent needs.

    The above six items are our main tasks in the future. There are many difficulties in doing these heavy tasks well. However, as in the past, we believe that under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, under the call of the resolutions of the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, relying on the solid and united unity of our fraternal ethnic groups, democratic parties, and people from all walks of life in the Southwest, we will surely be able to achieve new achievements and new victories in all aspects of work.

    西南区工作情况与今后任务
    ——一九五一年十一月十七日在西南军政委员会第三次全体委员会议上的报告
    邓小平
    九个多月来，我们在毛主席和中央人民政府的领导下，遵循着本会第二次全体委员会议决定的工作任务和各种决议，进行了各项工作，都获得了新的成就和胜利。
    西藏已和平解放，整个中国大陆出现了历史上从未有过的统一。人民解放军进藏部队在西北与西南人民和藏族同胞的支援下，已经胜利地进抵拉萨，并受到以达赖喇嘛为首的西藏地方政府和僧俗各界人民的热烈欢迎和拥戴，表现了中国各民族大团结的胜利。这不但粉碎了帝国主义的侵略阴谋，而且打下了巩固西陲国防的基础。
    抗美援朝保家卫国运动，已在西南各地普遍发展。全区广大人民包括各民族、各民主党派、各民主阶级和各种宗教信仰者，占城市百分之八十和乡村百分之六十左右的人口，都参加了这个伟大的爱国运动，受到了抗美援朝的爱国主义教育。有二千六百四十余万人参加抗美援朝、反对武装日本、保卫世界和平的示威游行。投票反对美国武装日本的人数在四千二百五十余万人以上，签名要求缔结五大国和平公约的人数有四千五百五十余万人。为响应中国人民抗美援朝总会的号召，各界人民在爱国增产基础上，已认捐飞机二百零九架、大炮十九门、高射炮十二门，多数地区业已完成而且超过了缴款的任务。全区大、中城市百分之八十至九十的人和乡村百分之七十左右的人都订立了爱国公约。伟大的抗美援朝运动对各项工作起了极大的推动作用，各阶层人民更加广泛地团结起来，提高了政治觉悟，基本上摧毁了媚美、崇美、恐美的错误思想，提高了民族自信心和民族自尊心，感觉到了作中国人民的光荣。但就运动的情况看来，没有受到抗美援朝爱国主义教育的空白地方，仍然不少，爱国公约更多流于形式，这是值得注意的。
    土地改革工作已经完成两期。业经完成分配土地的地区，包括一百七十二个县（其中七十一个整县）、八个市，共计四千四百一十二个乡，共计人口三千七百余万人。由于土地改革运动是在清匪、反恶霸、减租、退押、惩治违法地主等一系列斗争基础上展开的，又由于运动中执行了依靠贫雇农、团结中农、中立富农、消灭封建的正确路线，所以运动是有领导、有步骤、有秩序的，发展是正常的，加上不断地积累了经验，工作一期比一期做得更加踏实仔细，群众发动也更加充分深入。据现在估计约有百分之二十左右的土地改革地区，工作尚不够彻底，贫雇农的发动还不够充分，而在土地改革完成的地方，在一部分干部和农民积极分子中，正开始萌芽着一种“换班”、“松劲”的思想，从而不法地主得以乘机反攻和阴谋破坏。这些现象，是要在今后工作中加以补救和纠正的。
    镇压反革命工作自去冬起，西南全区依靠着广大人民的革命积极性，展开了大张旗鼓的镇压反革命运动，形成历史上从未有过的有领导有秩序的群众运动高潮。由于运动的开展是在群众的政治觉悟已
    有了提高的基础上，由于各民主党派、人民团体和各界人士的热烈拥护并参加了镇压反革命的斗争，以及各级人民政府和公安、检察、法院、司法等机关的努力，目前在全区大部分地区，反革命势力受到了沉重的打击。群众拍手称快，高呼：“人民政府有法有天”，从而大大提高了人民群众的政治积极性，社会秩序空前安定，人民政权也更加巩固了。但是镇压反革命运动的范围和群众发动的程度还不平衡，还有一部分地区镇压得不够彻底，群众没有发动起来，或发动得不充分，还有少数地区和某些方面的反革命分子至今还未开始镇压，还有待于今后继续彻底地贯彻镇压反革命的方针。
    物价保持继续稳定，工商业和农业有了显著的恢复和部分的发展。公私营工业也部分的进行了初步的民主改革，在“依靠工人、团结职员、搞好生产”的方针下，工人劳动热情和主人翁的感觉大为提高，生产逐步上升。由于我们大力组织与领导土产推销，组织城乡交流，有计划地加工订货，加上土地改革后人民购买力的提高，目前城市工商业已呈现“淡季不淡、旺季更旺”的好转现象。成渝铁路在全体员工的努力和西南人民的热烈支持下，今年年底可铺轨至内江，渝隆段已经通车营业。农业生产方面今年年成较好，加上农民翻身后生产情绪极为高涨，今年粮食产量较去年增加约近百分之二。工业原料作物的产量大都超过去年，棉花已超过战前水平。水利方面，因恢复与修建塘、堰和小型水利而增加的水田达二百万亩，超过原计划一倍。这些都是我们在工农业方面的若干成就。但在工农业发展的情况下，出现了一系列新的问题和新的困难，诸如市场扩大与产品不足的困难；工矿企业中的民主改革不够因而难以迎接伟大的爱国增产任务的困难；农业方面的肥料困难和贫雇农在土地改革后仍存在着的生产资料与生活资料不足的困难等等，都需要我们进行一系列的工作，加以妥善地解决。
    文化教育工作方面，结合着抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大运动的开展，人民的政治觉悟有了显著的提高。又由于文教工作者的努力，在人民群众中展开了广泛的有组织的反帝国主义和反封建主义思想教育与思想斗争，开始了对各种错误思想的批判运动，推动了各界人民的爱国运动和反帝反封建的思想斗争。在学校教育方面，结束了一些不应有的混乱状况，大大提高了教师学生的积极性。但是不可否认的，在思想改造运动这项根本工作方面，我们是远远落后于全国各地的，而学校的教育，则较文教工作的其他方面进步更慢。这种现状的克服，有待于今后的努力。
    少数民族工作又前进了一步，全区已先后成立民族自治区及民族联合政权一百五十个以上。参加工作的少数民族干部已有数万人，并还在大量培养中。此外在经济、贸易等方面，我们采取了扶助发展的方针，大力收购土产，供应日用品，因而逐渐改善了少数民族同胞的生活。在文化教育医药卫生等方面，也做了不少的工作。这样就大大改善了民族关系，加强了团结，各少数民族地区的同胞，热烈地响应了人民政府的各种号召，西康藏胞积极支援入藏部队，凉山彝族同胞自动捉拿土匪、特务近千人，都是最好的证明。
    以上这些成绩的获得，使我们全区工作又前进了一步，使我们的工作开始走上了轨道。为了进一步地发扬成绩，使西南工作赶上全国其他各地，以便迎接争取抗美援朝斗争的最后胜利和国家建设的艰巨任务，我们应遵照毛主席的指示和中国人民政治协商会议第三次会议的精神，结合着西南当前的实际情况，着重做好下列各项主要工作：
        （一）开展爱国增产节约运动。抗美援朝的伟大斗争还在进行，为了继续坚持这个正义的胜利的斗争，我们就需要继续加强抗美援朝工作，就需要 “增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”（毛主席）。开展广泛的群众性的增加生产厉行节约运动，就是争取抗美援朝斗争胜利的有力保证，就是加速国家建设的根本方针。它不仅可以保证市场的继续平稳和人民生活的安定，并可以树立与发扬我国人民勤俭朴素艰苦奋斗的传统风气。应该指出，目前我们在生产方面的缺点是很多的，浪费铺张的现象是严重的，必须从各个方面进行检查，订出增产节约计划，大力贯彻执行。
    在工矿企业方面，应教育与团结全体工人、技术人员和职员，进一步地提高设备利用率，加强机械的检修、保养及保安工作，加强技术管理和资金管理，节约资金，节约原料，减少废料，降低成本，提高产品质量，克服大材小用、优材劣用的现象。在进行基本建设工作时，要严格地根据基本建设程序进行勘察、设计和施工，加强工程现场的检查，从严格的控制和节制建设计划中去纠正基本建设上的严重浪费现象和贪污行为。一切工矿企业的领导干部，必须认真实行企业中的民主管理，充分发挥工人、技术人员与职员的积极性，把部、局、厂、矿的计划变成车间、小组的群众行动。每个车间或小组都应根据详细检查的结果，订出增产节约的计划。所有工人、技术人员和职员都应提高政治警惕性，防止暗藏的特务反动分子进行技术破坏，同时要建立严格的责任制度，减少责任事故到最低限度。
    在农业方面，要求在一九五二年按常年产量增产百分之五，至少不低于今年的水平。为此必须：大力提倡修筑塘堰，发展小型水利；提倡植树造林，严密注意防止旱灾，提倡饲养家畜（特别是养猪）以增加肥料，禁止宰杀耕牛，改善饲养方法，以减少牲畜死亡；在已土地改革的农村中，有重点有计划地建立合作社，宣传农民在农村固有互助合作组织的基础上，在自愿的原则下，建立与发展临时的或常年的各种互助组，以收组织起来、克服困难、增加生产的实效。鉴于食粮仍感不足的情况，各种经济作物的面积不宜盲目地扩大，而应从改良品种，讲求耕作技术，以提高每亩产量的方法达到增产的目的。此外，在农村中，还应提倡节约备荒，曾经在个别地方发生的大吃大喝的现象应加纠正。
    在林业方面，要严格纠正伐木工作中严重的浪费材料的现象，要把伐木计划和植林护林的任务结合起来，要防止地主盗卖树木。
    在财粮贸易方面，应加强业务学习，改善与提高经营能力，加速资金周转，减低商品流转费用，克服机构、设置、运输、保管等方面的浪费现象，更好地为国家工农业建设服务。一切税收人员和工商业者，应更高度地发扬爱国热忱，保证税收任务的完成。
    一切机关工作者，应把增产节约的任务贯彻到每个细小的事件中去，反对铺张浪费华而不实的作风，克服工作中的文牍主义和官僚主义，紧缩与合并重叠的机构，减少不必要的人员，为节省国家开支，提高工作效率而努力。
    爱国增产节约运动是全国人民的中心任务，也是我西南人民的中心任务，全西南人民必须动员起来，把它作为各厂矿企业、各机关、各界人民订立与修正爱国公约的主要内容，认真贯彻地行动起来。
    （二）加速完成土地改革。全区第三期土地改革业已开始，依据我们主观的能力，应争取于一九五二年底前，全区除不应进行土地改革的少数民族地区外，全部完成土地改革的任务。四川、西康两省全部应争取于明年春耕前基本完成此项任务。分配和处理山林的工作，亦应于明年年底前同时完成。凡属完成了土地改革的地区，应无例外地实行一次“复查”运动。复查运动内容包括下列各项，即：
    （1）处理遗留问题，进一步地发动群众，对于大约百分之二十工作不好的乡村实行补课；（2）评好产量，打下农业税的巩固基础；（3）颁发土地证。经过这些复查的工作，就可使农民在确定了地权和评好了产量的基础上，大大提高生产的积极性。在今年秋前完成土地改革的地区，除应进行分配和处理山林与进行复查工作之外，还应积极领导冬季生产，大量开办农村积极分子训练班，进一步地提高他们的政治觉悟，克服“换班”、“松劲”思想，以防止地主的反攻，并经过这批积极分子，组织全体农民，进行长期的贯彻始终的生产、教育和民主建政这三项基本工作。
    （三）认真进行工矿企业和行业的民主改革。把旧社会遗留下来的服务于帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的旧企业，改变为为人民的适应于新民主主义经济需要的新企业，其先决条件即在于实行工矿企业以至行业的民主改革。民主改革的基本方针，就是“依靠工人、团结职员、搞好生产”，其主要内容则是管理的民主化和生产的合理化。经过民主改革，一方面要做到充分发动群众，启发工人、技术人员和职员的主人翁感觉，清除一切暗藏在工矿企业和行业中的特务破坏分子和封建把头分子，并在群众觉悟的基础上实行民主管理，一改工矿企业的面貌。另一方面，则在民主运动的基础上，建立各种生产管理制度，以达到增产节约的目的。在这方面，我们已进行了初步工作，并开始获得了一些成绩。经验证明不论公私企业，凡执行了这一方针的，工人群众的生产热情就大大提高，一切不合理的现象就有可能得到纠正，暗藏的破坏分子就逐渐被检举出来，从而改进了组织领导，减少了事故，增加了生产。但必须指出，我们国营的工矿企业的民主改革，还仅仅是开始，其已开始了的，大都也极不彻底。而在私营企业方面，除个别厂矿外，一般地还未能认识民主改革的重要性，仍未下定决心认真实行民主改革。特别是在建筑、搬运、码头、木船等等重要行业中，除个别者外，都还没有进行任何的改革，以致大大影响了国计民生，阻碍公私经济的发展。在这些没有进行改革或改革得极不彻底的公私企业中，工人没有发动或者发动很不够，封建把头与旧的不合理的管理制度，仍旧压在工人头上，机关臃肿，冗员充斥，以及贪污浪费的现象严重存在，反革命分子活动无从检举，以致事故层出。如不少国营工厂不断发生技术破坏的政治事故，川南岷江电厂锅炉爆炸，重庆沙市纱厂仓库失火，均造成国家人民财产的巨大损失。因此，今后必须以国营工矿企业和重要行业为重点，认真进行民主改革。同时说服和鼓励资方在劳资协商的基础上，自觉地进行改革。使国家现有的公私设备能力得以充分发挥，以克服目前生产不足的弱点，并在爱国增产和支援人民志愿军的光荣的政治任务上，尽到自己的责任。
    （四）继续深入镇压反革命的斗争。经过去冬以来，全西南区进行了大规模的群众性的镇压反革命运动，获得了伟大胜利，给予了反革命分子以严重的打击。但在已往的运动中，只是对于那些已经暴露或比较容易发现的敌人打击得比较彻底，而对于那些隐蔽的暗藏在人民内部的反革命分子，特别是暗中的与背后的组织者，则打击得很不够。同时，也还存在着打击不彻底或根本未动的地区、部分和方面。在我们一般干部和人民中，常是痛恨那些显露的或蒙受其直接危害的反革命分子，而对于那些隐蔽的实际上为害更重危险性更大的反革命分子，却往往易于丧失警惕。因此，我们不能以既有成绩为满足，不能因胜而骄，以致丧失了我们的革命警惕性。我们既然懂得敌人一分钟也不会放松他们反革命的阴谋破坏活动，我们就必须在巩固已有胜利和发展胜利的方针下，继续深入地开展镇压反革命的斗争，凡一切镇压得不彻底或根本未动的地区、部分或方面，应配合中心工作，在普遍深入发动群众的基础上，彻底加以镇压。凡过去镇压得比较彻底的地方，也应继续发现那些隐蔽得更深的特务破坏分子，随时警惕他们采用更巧妙的方式来进行各种各色的破坏活动。对于混入机关、学校、工矿、企业部门的特务反动分子，尤应发动群众，经过缜密的侦察工作，加以发现和惩处。对于现有的人犯，应贯彻“劳动改造”政策，这是以强迫劳动消灭反革命分子的重要手段，也是彻底改造犯人成为新人的一项基本政策。对于分散交给群众实行管制的一般反革命分子，应实行行政管制与群众监督相结合、思想教育与劳动改造相结合的政策，并视其改悔程度，在一定时期之后，分别情形加以处理，或加重其处分，或取消其管制，以鼓励多数勇于改过，成为新人。对于反革命分子的家属，则应进行争取和教育工作，不能把他们当作反革命分子对待，并使他们明了反革命分子的罪恶，拥护人民政府严厉镇压反革命的正确措施。
    （五）文化教育方面。毛主席在最近政协会议的开会词中指示我们说：“思想改造，首先是各种知识分子的思想改造，是我国在各方面彻底实现民主改革和逐步实行工业化的重要条件之一。”同时这次政协会议更在决议中规定要“广泛展开思想改造运动，有系统地组织对于马克思、列宁主义与中国革命实践相结合的毛泽东思想的学习运动。”在这方面，虽然我们曾结合着抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大运动进行了一些工作，获得了一定的成绩，但不应过高地估计这种成绩，而应认为这仍是我们最弱的环节。例如最近有些学校在纠正了只搞运动忽视学业的倾向之后，又滋长着另一种只搞学业轻视政治的倾向。有人认为只要“学会数理化，走遍天下也不怕”，甚至个别教师劝说学生不要到国营工厂去实习，个别学生认为参加国庆游行也是妨害学习，不愿参加各种政治活动。关于“武训传”与“再生记”的讨论，也未能广泛地在文教界与各种知识分子中展开。特别是某些中等学校，思想更为混乱，甚至有仍在宣扬“武训精神”与宣传反动思想的。这些现象虽然是个别的比较突出的例子，但它的严重性是在于并未引起知识界应有的注意，甚至未受到应有的批判而让其流传，这是十分危险的。这说明了旧有学校教育事业是使理论与实践脱节的，如不在毛泽东思想的指导下加以改革，是很难适应目前祖国的国防建设与经济建设的需要的。因此，我们必须坚决响应毛主席和政协全国委员会的号召，在西南教育界、文化界和各种知识分子中，广泛开展思想改造运动，系统地学习马列主义与中国革命实践相结合的毛泽东思想，用批评与自我批评的方法，肃清帝国主义与封建主义的反动思想的影响，批判各种违反人民利益的错误思想，确立新民主主义的“理论与实践一致”的教学方针，以适应国家建设的需要。各地小学教师则应成立小学教师联合会，参加这一运动，努力改造和提高自己，确立全心全意为人民服务的思想。各级学校必须继续加深抗美援朝的爱国主义教育。在土地改革后的农村中，必须普遍开展冬学运动。在广大工农劳动群众中加强时事政治与增产节约的爱国教育。
    （六）少数民族工作。我们要坚持谨慎稳重的方针，使民族团结工作前进一步。根据以往的经验，通过各民族各界人民代表会议，在少数民族聚居区建立民族民主的区域自治政府，杂居区建立民族民主的联合政府，不但符合共同纲领中的民族政策，也是发扬民主、团结各民族的重要关键。同时，必须从经济、贸易、文教、卫生等方面予各兄弟民族以扶助，在这方面我们已经做了不少的工作，今后则应采取更多更有效的方法，做出更多的成绩。适应以上各项工作的开展，还必须注意民族干部的培养，加强各民族学院的工作，开办短期的或临时性的人数多少不等的训练班，以大量培养各民族人民的干部，以应急需。
    以上六项，就是我们今后主要的工作任务。做好这些繁重的工作，困难是很多的。但是，一如过去一样，我们相信：在毛主席和中央人民政府的正确领导下，在人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议决议的号召下，依靠我们西南各兄弟民族、各民主党派、各界人民坚固一致的团结，必能使各方面的工作获得新的成绩和新的胜利。
