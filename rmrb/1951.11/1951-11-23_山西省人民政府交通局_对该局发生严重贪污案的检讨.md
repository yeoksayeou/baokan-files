    Shanxi Provincial People's Government Transportation Bureau
    Self-Criticism Regarding a Serious Embezzlement Case in the Bureau

    To the Editor: We sincerely accept the criticism of the serious embezzlement case in our bureau published in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on September 12th. During the takeover in 1949, we discovered discrepancies between the materials in the East Garden warehouse and the accounting records. However, because it was difficult to determine whether these materials were missing after liberation, we postponed handling the matter. In the second half of 1950, while clearing the warehouse, we again found discrepancies between the materials and the figures in the accounts. Therefore, we began an in-depth investigation in November. After four months of investigation, the truth of this embezzlement case was finally revealed (as reported in the newspaper). In May of this year, we held an anti-corruption conference for all employees and an anti-corruption exhibition. The main reasons for such serious errors are as follows:

    (1) We did not conduct an in-depth understanding of retained personnel such as Zhao Yiru. We simply thought they were proficient in their business and retained them in their original positions with their original salaries. Furthermore, we lacked ideological and organizational leadership over them, resulting in significant losses to state property.

    (2) Work was not thorough, and there was serious bureaucratism: For example, after our first inspection of the warehouse managed by Zhao Yiru, we found that fifteen new and old tires and one hundred and thirty-five inner tubes were missing. At the time, we only thought there was no conclusive evidence and were afraid of handling the matter incorrectly, so we carelessly let it go, which emboldened the lawbreakers to act recklessly.

        (3) Lack of systems in the work, resulting in chaotic phenomena: We lacked scientific work systems. For example, when selling materials, we allowed the responsible personnel to set the price, and the leading cadres did not review it, which gave corrupt elements the opportunity to steal and embezzle.

    We feel very distressed that we did not handle the tasks entrusted to us by the government well. We have submitted two self-criticism reports to the Shanxi Provincial People's Government, requesting punishment.

                        Huo Qinglin, Director of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government Transportation Bureau

### 山西省人民政府交通局  对该局发生严重贪污案的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    山西省人民政府交通局
    对该局发生严重贪污案的检讨
    编辑同志：人民日报九月十二日“读者来信专页”栏发表的对我局发生严重贪污案的批评，我们诚恳地接受。我们于一九四九年接管时，曾检查出东花园仓库的物资与账目有所不符，但当时因很难确定这些物资是否在解放后没有的，所以便把此事留后处理。一九五○年下半年清理仓库时，我们又发现仓库材料与账上数字不符。于是，我们在十一月后开始进行了深入的检查。先后经过四个月的调查，终于使这件贪污案的真相大白（如报上所载）。今年五月份，我们召开了全体职工反贪污大会，以及举行了反贪污展览会。我们所以发生了这样严重的错误，其主要原因如下：
    （一）我们对留用人员赵以儒等没有进行深入的了解，单纯以为他们对业务熟练，就原职原薪地留用起来。并且，平时对他们又缺乏思想领导和组织领导，因而使国家财产遭受了很大损失。
    （二）工作不深入，有严重的官僚主义：如赵以儒保管的仓库，经过我们第一次检查，发现少了新旧轮胎十五条和内胎一百三十五条。当时我们只认为没有确实的材料，怕处理错了，遂把此事马虎放过，致使不法分子大胆妄为。
        （三）工作中缺乏制度，形成混乱现象：我们缺乏科学的工作制度，比如变卖材料，听任承办人员作价，领导干部并不审查，这给予腐化分子以偷盗贪污的机会。
    我们没有把政府交付的事情办好，觉得非常痛心。我们已先后向山西省人民政府写过两次检讨报告，请求处分。
                        山西省人民政府交通局局长　霍清林
