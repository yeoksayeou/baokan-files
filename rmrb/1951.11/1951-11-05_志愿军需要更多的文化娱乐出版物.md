    The Chinese People's Volunteer Army Needs More Cultural and Entertainment Publications

    Editor's Note: Wang Zhaolong and 19 other comrades from a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army sent a letter from the Korean front on October 11th to the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station. The letter mentioned that the Korean front needed more cultural and entertainment publications and included RMB 2,000 yuan, entrusting the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station to pre-order two copies of "The People's Songs." After reading the letter, all comrades of the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station's second, third, and fourth stations were deeply moved and immediately donated RMB 375,000 yuan to purchase 350 copies of "The People's Songs," entrusting this newspaper to forward them to the Korean front. In addition to delivering "The People's Songs" in full to the General Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea for forwarding to the Korean front, this newspaper hereby publishes the letter from Comrade Wang Zhaolong and others as follows:

    To the responsible comrades of the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station: We are cultural and entertainment workers from a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Here, many combatants, staff members, and service personnel like to sing songs of the motherland in their spare time. However, the few songs we currently have are outdated, and the soldiers unanimously reflect that "the songs are out of date." From May to now, we only saw the song "People of the World are of One Heart" in the People's Daily on September 15th, which was loved by all comrades in our unit. On September 22nd, we saw the news in the People's Daily advertisement column that the pocket edition of "The People's Songs" Volume 6 was published, and everyone jumped for joy. We immediately collected RMB 2,000 yuan to buy "The People's Songs." We are sending it now and ask you to pre-order two copies of "The People's Songs" for us. We will send the remaining amount in early October.

    Chinese People's Volunteer Army Unit
    Wang Zhaolong and 19 others

    志愿军需要更多的文化娱乐出版物
    编者按：中国人民志愿军某部王兆龙等二十人，于十月十一日由朝鲜前线寄给北京市人民广播电台一封信，信中提到朝鲜前线需要更多的文化娱乐的出版物，附寄了人民币两千元，委托北京市人民广播电台预购“人民歌声”两册。北京市人民广播电台第二、三、四台全体同志看了信深为感动，立即捐献人民币三十七万五千元，购买“人民歌声”三百五十册，托本报代转朝鲜前线。本报除已将“人民歌声”如数送交抗美援朝总会转寄朝鲜前线外，特将王兆龙等同志的来信发表如下：
    北京市人民广播电台负责同志：我们是志愿军某部文娱工作者。在我们这里，很多的战斗员、工作人员和勤杂人员，于工作余暇，都喜欢唱唱祖国的歌子。但是，我们现有几个歌子都陈旧了，战士们一致反映“歌子过时了”。从五月到现在，我们仅在九月十五日人民日报上看到了“全世界人民心一条”的歌曲，这首歌曲获得了我部全体同志的热爱。九月二十二日，我们又从人民日报广告栏内，看到“人民歌声”袖珍本第六集出版的消息，大家都高兴得跳起来，立即凑集人民币两千元买“人民歌声”，今特寄去，请代为预购“人民歌声”两册，余款当于十月初寄上。
    志愿军某部    王兆龙等二十人
