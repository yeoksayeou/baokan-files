The Second Police Station Chief and Others in Beijing's Sixteenth District Disregard Women's Safety
Causing the Tragic Incident of Meng Qingkun Killing His Wife and Committing Suicide

    On September 3rd, a case of Meng Qingkun killing his wife and then committing suicide occurred in Mentougou Town, Sixteenth District, Beijing. The occurrence of this case is inseparable from the bureaucratic work style of certain government workers in the district who disregard women's safety.

    The perpetrator, Meng Qingkun, was from Ba County, Hebei Province, and was forty-four years old this year. In 1946, he married祁桂兰(Qi Guilan), a widow (from Yanqing County, Chahar Province, thirty-three years old) in Xuanhua. In 1948, he came to Mentougou to make a living. In 1949, he brought his wife Qi Guilan, his mother-in-law, and two daughters left by Qi Guilan's ex-husband to live in Mentougou. At that time, the couple often quarreled and fought due to difficult living conditions. In 1950, Meng worked at the Xinhua Brickyard outside Guang'anmen in Beijing, where he spent his wages recklessly and constantly frequented prostitutes, rarely sending money to Qi Guilan. Because the family had no means of living, and Meng had contracted venereal disease (his genitals had begun to ulcerate), Qi Guilan became involved with another coal mine worker, Liu Decai, and the family's living expenses were entirely supplied by Liu Decai.

    On August 26th of this year, after Meng Qingkun returned home, he forced Qi Guilan to sleep with him. Qi, fearing contracting venereal disease, firmly refused and proposed a divorce. Meng firmly refused to agree. On the 28th, Qi Guilan discovered that Meng had hidden scissors and a knife under the mat. Afraid, she immediately reported to the local police station, saying, "Meng Qingkun has prepared a knife and scissors, and I don't know if he wants to kill me or commit suicide." At the time, she also proposed to the police station chief, Mu Changqing, that because of her poor relationship with Meng and Meng's serious venereal disease, she requested a divorce. Mu Changqing sent someone to check and found a small knife and scissors under Meng's sleeping mat. At that time, seeing that the scissors were rusty and the knife was also blunt, he subjectively estimated that nothing would happen. When asked, Meng firmly denied any intention of suicide or murder. Mu Changqing, because he usually knew Meng, believed Meng's lies and did not take the matter seriously. That afternoon, Qi Guilan came to the police station again, crying incessantly, and firmly requested a divorce, still stating that Meng was preparing to kill her. However, Director Mu only believed Meng's words, believing that "Qi Guilan was committing adultery" and that "the knife and scissors were deliberately placed under the mat by Qi to create an excuse for divorce." Therefore, he did not listen to Qi Guilan's crying and said impatiently, "If you want a divorce, go to court!" Until one o'clock at night, Qi Guilan was still crying and afraid to go home. Later, Director Mu brought Meng and Qi's cousin to take Qi Guilan away. Qi insisted on not leaving and was finally pushed out.

    On the 29th, Qi Guilan went to the Beijing Suburban People's Court's Sixteenth District Trial Tribunal to request a divorce and told the above-mentioned process to the assistant judge Zhang Benzhong. Zhang did not notice the seriousness of the issue either, only saying that he did not have enough understanding of the specific situation, and Qi had not brought a letter of introduction from the street, town government, or public security police station, so he would have to wait for an investigation before handling it. He told Qi to go home first and come to the trial tribunal again on September 4th. At that time, Qi was unwilling to go home and cried in the court for two hours. Finally, Qi proposed to stay in a shop outside, and Zhang Benzhong discussed it with Meng before saying that she could stay in a shop temporarily. On September 3rd, Qi Guilan had no choice but to return home. Meng deceived her to go to the Sixteenth District Trial Tribunal of the Suburban People's Court. When they walked to the edge of the sorghum field in front of Gate No. 6 in Mentougou, Meng took out a knife he had prepared in advance and stabbed Qi seven times in the waist and head. Qi died on the spot. Meng, fearing punishment, also committed suicide. (Zhu Bo)

　　北京十六区第二派出所长等漠视妇女生命安全
    造成孟庆坤杀妻自杀的惨痛事件
    北京市第十六区门头沟镇于九月三日发生了孟庆坤杀死妻子而后自杀的案件。这一案件的发生，是和该区某些政府工作人员的漠视妇女生命安全的官僚主义作风分不开的。
    凶犯孟庆坤是河北省霸县人，今年四十四岁。一九四六年在宣化和寡妇祁桂兰（察哈尔省延庆县人，三十三岁）结婚，一九四八年来门头沟谋生。一九四九年将其妻祁桂兰、岳母及祁桂兰前夫留下的二女接至门头沟居住。当时夫妇因生活困难，经常吵嘴打架。一九五○年孟犯在北京市广安门外新华砖窑厂作工，所得工资，胡乱花掉，还不断嫖女人，很少给祁桂兰捎钱。祁桂兰因为一家人生活无着，又加上孟犯染了花柳病（生殖器已开始溃烂），便和另一煤矿工人刘德才好起来，全家生活费完全靠刘德才供给。
    今年八月二十六日孟庆坤回家后，强迫祁桂兰和他同睡。祁怕染上花柳病，坚决拒绝；并提出离婚。孟犯坚不答应。二十八日，祁桂兰发现孟犯在席底下藏有剪子和刀子各一把，心里害怕，便马上到当地派出所报告说：“孟庆坤准备了刀子和剪子，不知道要杀我还是要自杀。”当时并向派出所所长穆长清提出，因与孟犯感情不好，孟又有严重的花柳病，要求离婚。穆长清曾派人前往检查，在孟犯睡席底下找出小刀和剪子。当时看见剪子已生锈，刀子也是钝的，便主观地估计不会发生什么问题。问孟时，孟又坚决否认有自杀或杀人的意图。穆长清因为平时就和孟犯认识，就轻信了孟的谎话，没有把这件事情重视起来。当天下午祁桂兰又到派出所来，一直痛哭不止，坚决要求离婚，仍然提出孟犯有准备杀人的意思。而穆所长只相信孟犯的话，认为“祁桂兰与人通奸”，“小刀和剪子是祁故意放在席底下制造离婚藉口的”；因此就不听祁桂兰的哭诉，很不耐烦地说：“离婚就上法院去！”直到夜里下一点钟，祁桂兰仍然痛哭着不敢回家。后来穆所长把孟犯和祁的表弟找来，要他们将祁桂兰领走。祁坚持不走，最后被推出来了。
    二十九日，祁桂兰到北京市郊区人民法院驻十六区审判庭去请求离婚，又把上述经过告诉了该庭助审员张本忠。张也没有注意到这一问题的严重性，只说对具体情况不够了解，祁又没有带来街、镇政府或公安派出所的介绍信，要等调查后再处理。要祁先回家去，到九月四日再来审判庭。当时祁不愿回家，并在法院痛哭了两小时之久。最后，祁提出要住在外边店里，张本忠又和孟犯商量后才说可以暂时住店。九月三日，祁桂兰无奈回家，孟犯欺骗她到郊区人民法院驻第十六区审判庭去。当走至门头沟六号门前高粱地边时，孟犯即拿出预先准备好的刀子，对准祁的腰部和脑部连刺七刀。祁当场死去。孟犯畏罪，也自杀身死。（朱波）
