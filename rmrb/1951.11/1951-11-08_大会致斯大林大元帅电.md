To Respected Marshal Stalin:

    We extend our utmost enthusiasm and joy to celebrate the thirty-fourth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, which opened a new era in human history, and to express our sincere and warm respect to you and all the Soviet people under your leadership!

    The Soviet Union, the world's first socialist country born in the flames of the October Revolution, is a strong fortress of world peace, democracy, and socialism, and the hope of all mankind. Under the banner of Lenin and under your leadership, the great Soviet people have built socialism and are now advancing victoriously towards communism. They inspire the people of the world to move towards peace and happiness, towards socialism and communism.

    The victory of the great Chinese People's Revolution is inseparable from the great October Socialist Revolution. The October Revolution pointed out the road to liberation for oppressed nations and taught them the theory and methods of revolution. Thus, we Chinese people were able to achieve today's great victory under the leadership of the great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party and its leader, Chairman Mao Zedong. However, this victory would not have been possible without the consistent support of the Soviet Union. Therefore, as we celebrate the thirty-fourth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, we want to thank you for providing us, the Chinese people, with the path to liberation, and thank you and the Soviet people for your valuable assistance and friendship.

    As the people of the world warmly celebrate the thirty-fourth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, the U.S. imperialism and its servants, regardless of their historical defeats in Asia and around the world, are still frantically preparing for war, attempting to destroy the achievements of the October Revolution and save their increasingly doomed fate. Therefore, we must further consolidate the world peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union, and first of all, strengthen the friendly unity between China and the Soviet Union, in order to completely crush the aggressive war schemes of the imperialist bloc.

    All imperialists in the world are destined to die, and the path of the October Revolution is bound to triumph!

    Long live the great October Socialist Revolution!

    Long live the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics!

    Long live Marshal Stalin, the leader and teacher of the working people of the world!

    Long live the unbreakable friendship and cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union!

    The Commemorative Meeting of All Circles in the Capital Celebrating the Thirty-Fourth Anniversary of the Soviet October Socialist Revolution
    November 7, 1951, Beijing

    大会致斯大林大元帅电敬爱的斯大林大元帅：
    我们谨以无比的热情和无限的喜悦，来庆祝为人类历史开辟了新纪元的伟大十月社会主义革命的三十四周年，并向您和在您领导下的全体苏联人民致真诚热烈的敬意！
    在十月革命火焰中诞生的世界上第一个社会主义国家苏联，是世界和平、民主与社会主义的坚强堡垒，是全人类的希望。伟大的苏联人民，在列宁的旗帜下，在您的领导下，业已建成了社会主义，如今则正向共产主义胜利前进。他们鼓舞着世界人民走向和平和幸福、走向社会主义和共产主义。
    中国人民大革命的胜利是和伟大的十月社会主义革命分不开的。十月革命指出了被压迫民族争取解放的道路，教给了被压迫民族革命的理论和方法。于是我们中国人民就能在伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东主席的领导下争取了今天的伟大胜利。但是这个胜利，如果没有苏联一贯的支援，也是不可能得到的。所以，庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十四周年，我们要感谢您给我们中国人民争取解放的道路，感谢您和苏联人民给予我们中国人民可贵的援助和友谊。
    当世界人民热烈庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十四周年之际，美帝国主义及其仆从们竟不顾它们在亚洲及全世界的历史挫败，还在疯狂地进行战争准备，妄图摧毁十月革命的成果，挽救它们日趋灭亡的命运。因此，我们必须更进一步巩固以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营，首先是加强中苏两大国的友好团结，以期彻底粉碎帝国主义集团的侵略战争阴谋。
    世界上一切帝国主义注定要死亡，十月革命的道路必定要胜利！
    伟大的十月社会主义革命万岁！
    伟大的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟万岁！
    全世界劳动人民的领袖和导师斯大林大元帅万岁！
    中苏两国人民的牢不可破的友谊与合作万岁！
    首都各界庆祝苏联十月社会主义革命三十四周年纪念大会
    一九五一年十一月七日北京
