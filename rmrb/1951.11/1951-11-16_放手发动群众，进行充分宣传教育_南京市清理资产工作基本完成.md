Letting Go and Mobilizing the Masses, Conducting Thorough Propaganda and Education
    Nanjing City Basically Completes Asset Inventory Work

    The asset inventory and capital verification work of state-owned enterprises in Nanjing City has basically been completed. Through this inventory work, most units have discovered serious phenomena of stockpiling and wasting state property. The Telecommunications Bureau cleared out more than 1,700 kinds of stockpiled equipment, totaling more than 20,000 pieces, including stockpiled cathode tubes that could last for a hundred years. The minimum estimate of stockpiled state funds is over 10 billion yuan. The Wired Electrical Factory cleared out stockpiled equipment worth 1.3 billion yuan and also cleared out 23 tons of steel from waste products. The Water Plant cleared out a diesel generator that had never been used, which could supply a city of 100,000 people. The plant's stockpiled trunk pipes could build half a water plant of the same scale. The Nanjing Machinery Factory cleared out more than 400 kinds of off-the-books assets, and in more than 1,000 kilograms of scrap iron, they cleared out several hundred kilograms of valuable steel materials. In the waste materials, they cleared out a set of machines worth 20 million yuan. The area of waste material accumulated at the Radio Factory reached 800 square meters.

    This inventory work is a good education for the employees of state-owned enterprises in Nanjing City. The inventory work exposed the serious situation of waste and loss caused by erroneous thinking such as "only valuing production and not valuing management," "departmentalism," and "generous budgeting and tight use." After seeing this situation, the employees were all shocked and felt that thorough improvement was necessary. Through this inventory work, enterprise leaders began to understand the "family assets" of their production units. Many units have formulated several new systems based on the problems discovered in the inventory to consolidate the achievements of the inventory work. Now, on this basis, each unit is starting the work of machine appraisal and valuation.

    The inventory work in the asset inventory and capital verification work in Nanjing City proceeded relatively smoothly and achieved greater results. This is primarily because the main responsible cadres took personal charge, the leading cadres of various enterprises worked together, and thorough preparations were made for various tasks. The inventory work was personally overseen by the director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Nanjing Municipal People's Government and the secretary of the Enterprise Party Committee of the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. Within each factory, the factory director was primarily responsible for the inventory work. In the preparatory work, leading cadres fought against various erroneous ideas. The first meeting of the Nanjing City Asset Inventory and Capital Verification Committee repeatedly studied and read the People's Daily editorial "Capital Verification Requires Unfolding Ideological Struggle." Subsequently, a large-scale propaganda and education campaign was launched throughout the city. The city successively held two mobilization meetings of enterprise cadres and activists with more than a thousand people each, and organized two city-wide employee broadcast mobilization meetings. All employees in the city generally studied asset inventory and capital verification. After such ideological education, various concerns and erroneous ideas in the inventory work were basically overcome. For example, impatience, lack of attention to inventory work, and thoughts of "unwillingness" and "fear of embarrassment" when clearing small warehouses. At the same time, the Nanjing City Asset Inventory and Capital Verification Committee and the asset inventory and capital verification committees of various enterprises established specialized organizations at each level to complete various technical preparations (such as drafting inventory registration forms and collecting price standards). Due to thorough preparation, the inventory work formed a wave of enthusiasm throughout the city.

    Another characteristic of the Nanjing City inventory work is the conscientious implementation of the policy of letting go and mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses. In the inventory work, each factory educated and mobilized the masses with actual examples. This education method was the most effective. Water plants, wired electrical factories, telecommunications bureaus, hydraulic instrument factories, etc., all held anti-waste exhibitions, displaying the waste and loss caused by stockpiled funds with physical objects, and organizing all factory employees to visit and discuss. The Radio Factory organized workers and technicians to visit the warehouse. In the mountains of waste and old materials piled up in the warehouse, many valuable tools and materials were cleared out. Some of these tools and materials were already rusty, but the users did not know and often had to find ways to buy them at high prices. Master Ma Rengen had long wanted to use a 0.8 mm milling cutter blade, but had not been able to buy it. Now, he found that there were more than 200 pieces in the warehouse. These vivid facts powerfully educated the broad masses of employees. After the supply section chief of the Telecommunications Bureau finished watching the exhibition, the receptionist asked him to give his opinion. He said painfully: "I have no opinion to offer. I want to go back and write a profound self-criticism." Worker Wang Qingling of the Water Plant said: "It's really heartbreaking to see these. This is the people's blood and sweat!" Everyone deeply realized the importance of asset inventory and capital verification. After the workers of the Radio Factory visited the warehouse, more than 200 workers immediately signed up to participate in the inventory work as voluntary labor on Sundays. Due to the enthusiastic participation of more than 120 young workers from the Jiangnan Automobile Company in voluntary labor, they quickly completed the clearing of a large amount of waste materials. Many difficulties also arose in the inventory work, but they were all solved smoothly by relying on the workers. For example, the Water Plant was unable to inventory the underground water pipes because the blueprints and data were incomplete and scattered. Later, several symposiums were held with old workers. The old workers recalled and corrected 208 errors, completed the inventory work, and found 19 off-the-books water stations. The machine appraisal and registration were also organized by old workers in most factories. Because the old workers were familiar with the machines, they discovered hidden accidents in the machines during the appraisal. When solving technical problems, the Nanjing City Asset Inventory and Capital Verification Committee transferred experienced old workers and engineers from various factories to conduct centralized research, so that various difficult problems were solved smoothly.

### 放手发动群众，进行充分宣传教育  南京市清理资产工作基本完成

　　放手发动群众，进行充分宣传教育
    南京市清理资产工作基本完成
    南京市国营企业清理资产核定资金工作已基本完成。经过这次清点工作，大多数单位都发现了严重的积压和浪费国家资财的现象。电信局清出积压器材一千七百余种，共二万余件，其中积压的阴极管可用一百年，最低估计积压国家资金在一百亿元以上。有线电厂清点出被积压的器材价值十三亿元，并在废品中清出二十三吨钢。自来水厂清出一部从未用过的柴油发电机，可供十万人口城市之用。该厂积压的干管可以办半个与该厂同等规模的水厂。南京机器厂清出账外资产四百多种，在一千多公斤的废铁中，清出了几百斤贵重钢料，在废料中清出了一套价值二千万元的机器。无线电厂废料堆积面积达八百平方公尺。
    这次清点工作，对于南京市国营企业的职工是个很好的教育。清点工作暴露了“只重生产不重经营”、“本位主义”、“宽打窄用”等错误思想所造成的浪费和损失的严重情况。职工们看到了这种情况后都大吃一惊，觉得非彻底改进不可。经过这次清点工作，企业领导干部开始摸清了本生产单位的“家底子”。有许多单位根据清点中发现的问题，订出了若干新制度，以巩固清点工作的成绩。现各单位正在这一基础上，开始机器的鉴定和估价工作。
    南京市清理资产核定资金工作中的清点工作，进行得比较顺利，并获得较大成绩。这首先是由于主要负责干部亲自负责，各企业的领导干部共同动手，充分进行了各项准备工作。清点工作是由南京市人民政府财政经济委员会主任与中共南京市委企业党委书记亲自掌握的。在各厂内，绝大部分都由厂长负清点工作的主要责任。在准备工作中，领导干部和各种错误思想进行了斗争。南京市清理资产核定资金委员会第一次会议曾反复研究阅读人民日报“核定资金要展开思想斗争”的社论，接着，在全市展开了大规模的宣传教育工作。全市先后举行了两次千人以上的企业干部和积极分子的动员大会，组织了两次全市职工广播动员大会。全市职工并普遍进行了清理资产核定资金的学习。经过了这样的思想教育，基本上克服了清点工作中的各种顾虑和错误思想。比如急躁病，对清点工作不重视以及清理小仓库时的“舍不得”、“怕难为情”等思想。与此同时，南京市清理资产核定资金委员会和各企业清理资产核定资金委员会都按级成立了专门组织，完成各种技术准备（如拟订清点登记表格，搜集物价标准等）。由于准备工作充分，清点工作在全市形成了热潮。
    南京市清点工作的另一特点是认真贯彻了放手发动群众，依靠群众的方针。各厂在清点工作中都以实际事例，教育和发动群众。这种教育方法收效最大。自来水厂、有线电厂、电信局、水工仪器厂等，都举行了反浪费展览会，把积压资金造成的浪费损失，以实物陈列出来，组织全厂职工参观和讨论。无线电厂组织了工人、技术人员参观仓库，在库内堆积如山的废旧料中，清出了许多贵重工具和材料。这些工具和材料有的已经生锈，但是使用的人不知道，往往还须设法以高价购买。马仁根老师傅早就要零点八米厘铣刀片用，一直未买到，现在发现仓库里还有二百多片。这些活生生的事实，有力地教育了广大职工。电信局供应科长看完展览，招待员要他提意见，他沉痛地说：“我没有意见可提，我要回去写篇深刻的检讨”。自来水厂工人王庆龄说：“看了这些真叫人痛心，这是人民的血汗呀！”大家深深体会到了清理资产核定资金的重要。无线电厂工人参观了仓库后，立即有二百多工人报名，以星期义务劳动参加清点工作。江南汽车公司由于一百二十余青年工人热烈参加义务劳动，很快地完成了大量废料的清理工作。在清点工作中也曾发生不少困难，但都依靠工人顺利地解决了。如自来水厂因蓝图资料散失不全，无法清点埋在地下的水管。后来召开了几次老工人座谈会，由老工人进行回忆，纠正了二百零八件差错，完成了清点工作，并查出了账外水站十九处。机器的鉴定登记大多数工厂也都是组织老工人解决的。由于老工人熟悉机器，在鉴定中发现了机器的隐藏事故。在解决技术问题时，南京市清理资产核定资金委员会抽调各厂有经验的老工人、工程师集中研究，使得各种困难问题顺利解决。（本报特约记者　艾煊、季音）
