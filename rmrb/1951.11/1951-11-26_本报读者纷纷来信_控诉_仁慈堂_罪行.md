Readers of This Newspaper Write Letters One After Another
Accusing "Ren Ci Tang" of Crimes

Editor's Note: After this newspaper published letters from readers Bai Xiaoquan and Yang Yuhua yesterday accusing the Xishiku "Ren Ci Tang" in Beijing of trafficking in people and of Zhang Xiaosi dying in "Ren Ci Tang", we received a letter of accusation from all 64 employees of the church and many letters from readers accusing "Ren Ci Tang" of crimes yesterday alone. They unanimously demanded that the People's Government handle the matter promptly. The following is a part of the readers' letters.

Employees of Xishiku "Ren Ci Tang"
Accuse Imperialist Elements of Murdering Children
Demand That the People's Government Take Over "Ren Ci Tang" Quickly

Comrade Editor: We are the employees of the Xishiku "Ren Ci Tang" in Beijing. The so-called "Ren Ci Tang" is actually a tool for imperialist elements to carry out aggression and murder of the Chinese people under the guise of "charity". In the past ten years, imperialist elements have used this aggressive organization to kill more than 2,000 of our children. The cruel way they persecuted children is unimaginable. We have personally witnessed such tragic scenes, and we still feel terrified when we think about them. For example, the orphan Xu Lancai was tortured until she became ill, and before she had even breathed her last breath, she was stripped naked and put into a coffin. In the coffin, she shouted hoarsely, "Mom, Mom, I..." hoping to live. But the cruel imperialist elements said, "She's not going to live anyway. She didn't listen when she was alive, and she will go to hell when she dies." Xu Lancai was buried alive like this. In the past ten years, I don’t know how many children have died tragically like this!

Some of us have been working here for ten years. In these ten years, we have been like their cattle, suffering from exploitation, oppression and bullying. We usually have to work ten hours a day, without enough to eat or wear, but the monthly reward is not enough to buy a foot of cloth.

They not only use exploitation and persecution to destroy our bodies, but they also use imperialist ideas to paralyze our minds. Here, everything has to be said to be "good" about imperialism. They often insult us, saying that we Chinese are a "backward" nation. They are doing their best to instill pro-foreign ideas in the children. Due to their long-term enslavement education, the children have lost their patriotism. After liberation, they instigated children to hate the People's Government and the Communist Party, saying that the People's Liberation Army specializes in "killing and arson". What a despicable and vicious method!

When we ask for a raise, if they are happy, they will deceive us with nonsense such as "we are all believers" and "'Ren Ci Tang' is for serving God and for serving orphans." If they are unhappy, they will say something like "'Ren Ci Tang' is open, no one asked you to come in the first place, you can leave if you don't want to do it." Not only that, but our freedom is also restricted. We cannot go to the inner courtyard for no reason, and we are not allowed to go out of the gate. Whenever they call us, we have to be there. But the imperialist elements eat well and dress warmly, eat bread and butter, drink coffee and milk, use beautiful and noble electric refrigerators, go out in cars, and live a luxurious life.

"Ren Ci Tang" is nominally to help children, but the children here, like the workers, have to work from morning to night every day: weaving, sewing socks, and embroidery. They ship the good work done by the children abroad to sell, and the ordinary ones are sold on the market. But the children don't have enough to eat or wear every day, they are beaten and scolded, and live an inhuman life, being exploited by them without compensation.

The above is a general description of the imperialist elements of "Ren Ci Tang" harming children and oppressing and exploiting us. We can't write well, and even if we can, their crimes can't be written completely.

After several months of study, our awareness has been raised, and we have further realized the sinister faces of imperialist elements. We hope that the government will take over "Ren Ci Tang" as soon as possible, rescue us from the clutches of imperialist elements, and severely punish imperialist elements. This is our only request!

Accusation of Children of Xishiku "Ren Ci Tang" Orphanage

Comrade Editor: I am a child of the Xishiku "Ren Ci Tang" Orphanage in Beijing. My name is Hou Anding, and I am thirteen years old this year. I have been in "Ren Ci Tang" for more than five years. When I first came here, the imperialist elements asked me to recite scriptures and memorize scriptures. If I couldn't memorize them, they would put me in a dark room and beat me with a board. After beating me, they would ask me to kneel down and recite; if I couldn't recite, they would slap my face. When I was eleven years old, they started asking me to make socks. If I made them badly, they would hit my hands until they were bruised. That winter, because I couldn't recite the Bible, the imperialist elements drove me to the toilet to make socks, and my hands were frozen and bleeding. I rubbed my hands to warm them, and they said I stole the thread and didn't give me any coarse cornbread for a day. In winter, they asked me to pick coal cinders. Because it was cold, I rubbed my hands, and when they saw it, they punished me by kneeling on the cold tile floor to recite scriptures. The next day, I was punished to take care of the toilet. The toilet water pipe was broken, and they asked me to pay for it. I couldn't afford to pay, so they beat my hands with a board until they bled. Comrade Editor: I and my other sisters have suffered so much, I can't finish telling you. I ask the government to punish the imperialist elements, and I hope that the government will take over "Ren Ci Tang" quickly.

Comrade Editor: I am a child of the Xishiku "Ren Ci Tang" Orphanage in Beijing. I want to tell you about the suffering I have endured here. I remember that when I first came here, the imperialist elements asked me to sew socks. I didn't know how to sew, and when I sewed them badly, they dragged me into the room and beat me with a rattan. Once when I was eating, I broke a bowl, and after that, they never gave me a bowl to use again. I begged many times before they gave me a rusty iron can to use. Sometimes when we eat, they ask us to drink some messy soup, which is as unpalatable as the soup for feeding livestock. We can't drink it, but they stand by and watch with willow sticks in their hands, and we have to drink it, or they will beat us. I am responsible for sweeping the yard in "Ren Ci Tang". Once it rained heavily, and I couldn't go to sweep. The imperialist elements beat me into the water with a broom and made me sweep in the water. When doing needlework, you can't get it dirty at all. If you get it dirty, you will be kicked. If you are kicked and it hurts, you don't dare to cry. We have suffered too much, and we can't finish talking about it in a few days. I hope the government will take over "Ren Ci Tang" quickly, and I hope my letter will be published.

"Ren Ci Tang" Tortured My Cousin Wang Yuqin to Death

My cousin Wang Yuqin has been dead for five years. Whenever I think of Yuqin's death, I particularly hate the barbarity and cruelty of the imperialists.

As early as before the Anti-Japanese War, my aunt sent her thirteen-year-old daughter Yuqin to the "Ren Ci Tang" in Xishiku, Beijing. The following year, my aunt died of illness. After that, I went to see Yuqin once a week and brought her some food, utensils, and clothes. Every time I went to see her, I always found her unhappy. She would only say a word when asked, and her body was very weak. Not only did she not grow taller, but she also shrank. When she was fifteen or sixteen years old, she looked like she was seven or eight years old. At that time, I wanted to take her out, but because my family was poor, I couldn't afford it. Later, during a summer vacation, I took her out to live for more than a month. There were only my sister, her, and me at home. My sister was the same age as her, but she looked half bigger than her. She was always depressed and taciturn. At first, I thought she was because her mother had died, but later I learned that she had been tortured like this in "Ren Ci Tang".

Yuqin and other children fostered in the Xishiku "Ren Ci Tang" had to work every day (including wiping the floor - kneeling on the floor and wiping with a rag, sweeping the yard, washing clothes, etc.), and doing work (knitting socks, sewing pockets, etc.). These hard jobs are really not light for children of a few years old and teenagers. But what do they eat? Every day, it's either cornbread or thin porridge, and sometimes there isn't even cornbread. The flour used to make cornbread was full of meat worms more than an inch long, and the cornbread was steamed half-cooked, with worms lying on it one by one. When it's good, there are vegetables, which are some boiled rotten cabbage and rotten radish. The poor children of "Ren Ci Tang" don't want to eat, but they have to eat, because the "grandma" (nun) is watching. As a result, the children eat with tears in their eyes, and they don't dare to cry (if they cry, they will be beaten by the "grandma") and they don't dare to speak loudly.

"Ren Ci Tang" has a very good courtyard, but the children are not allowed to play there. When the "grandma" is nearby, they can only crack a bitter smile. After the "grandma" leaves, they close their mouths and stand like wooden chickens. At that time, I saw that Yuqin had two thick patches of skin as big as steamed buns on her knees, so I asked her how they grew. She told me timidly with tears in her eyes that they were worn out from kneeling and wiping the floor every day.

When Yuqin was living at home, I often said that she was not lively and unhappy. She always stumbled when walking, but this was actually a morbid condition. Because my family was poor, I couldn't raise her, so I finally sent her back to the fire pit (I really regret it now). The second week after sending her back to "Ren Ci Tang", I went to see her, and she could barely struggle to come out. I saw that she had difficulty walking, and when I asked her carefully, I learned that her legs hurt. So, I sent her cotton pants and medicine to treat her leg pain. On the third Sunday, I went to see her again, and she couldn't walk anymore. "Ren Ci Tang" refused to treat her, and I couldn't afford to take her out for medical treatment, so she was sick like this for two years, and finally died in that evil "Ren Ci Tang" that sells dog meat under the guise of a sheep's head when she was nineteen years old.

When Yuqin was alive, on a Sunday in the summer, I went to see her. In the reception room, I always smelled a strange stench. When I asked her, she secretly told me in a low voice: there were dead children in the next room. I also asked why the hall didn't tell the child's parents to collect and bury them. She said that the dead child was from the "inner study room" ("outer study room" children have families and are taken care of a little; "inner study room" children have no families and are much more miserable than "outer study room"), no one cares, and they are left there when they die. Because the hall has dead children every day, it takes three or four days to accumulate enough to fill a box before burying them together.

I want to accuse, accuse the imperialist "charitable organizations" of harming our country's children. I will never forget how Yuqin died. I want to accuse for Yuqin, and accuse for countless victims of children. Today, in Beijing, we do not allow any imperialist "charitable organizations" that sell dog meat under the guise of a sheep's head and kill people without knives to continue to kill our country's children. I hope that the People's Government will strictly deal with the criminals of the Xishiku "Ren Ci Tang" and avenge the victimized children of the motherland. Wang Yulin

### 本报读者纷纷来信  控诉“仁慈堂”罪行

专栏：读者来信

    本报读者纷纷来信
    控诉“仁慈堂”罪行
    编者按：本报昨日发表了白小泉和杨育化两位读者控诉北京西什库“仁慈堂”贩卖人口和张小四死在“仁慈堂”的来信以后，昨日一天即收到了该堂全体职工六十四人的控诉信和许多读者控诉“仁慈堂”罪行的信件。他们一致要求人民政府迅速处理。下面发表的是读者来信的一部分。
    西什库“仁慈堂”职工
    控诉帝国主义分子杀害儿童罪行
    要求人民政府迅速接办“仁慈堂”
    编辑同志：我们是北京西什库“仁慈堂”的职工。所谓“仁慈堂”，实际上就是帝国主义分子假借“慈善”之名，进行侵略和杀害中国人民的工具。近十年来，帝国主义分子利用这个侵略机关，害死了我们两千多名儿童。他们迫害儿童的惨酷情形，是令人不可想像的。我们曾亲眼看到那种惨绝人寰的情景，现在想起来，还觉得毛骨悚然。例如孤儿徐兰彩被他们折磨得病了，在还没断气的时候，就被脱光衣服，装进了棺材。她在棺材里还声嘶力竭地喊着：“妈妈，妈妈，我不……”希望能得到活命。但狠心的帝国主义分子反说：“反正她活不成了，她生的时候不听话，死了也要下地狱。”徐兰彩就这样被活埋了。十年来像这样惨死的儿童，不知有多少！
    我们之中，有的在这里服务已经十年了。在这十年中，我们像他们的牛马一样，受尽了剥削、压迫和欺凌。平时每天要工作十小时，吃不饱，穿不暖，每月的报酬却买不到一尺布。
    他们不只是用剥削和迫害的方法在摧残着我们的肉体，同时他们还用帝国主义的思想来麻醉我们的精神。在这里，什么都得说帝国主义的“好”。他们经常侮辱我们，说我们中国人是“落后”民族。他们极力在向孩子们灌输崇外思想。由于受了他们长期的奴化教育，孩子们失去了爱国心。解放后，他们唆使儿童仇恨人民政府，仇恨共产党，说解放军专门“杀人放火”。这是多么卑鄙和恶毒的手段！
    当我们要求增加工资时，如果碰到他们高兴，就以什么“我们同是教徒”啦，“‘仁慈堂’是为天主服务的、是为孤儿服务的”等鬼话来欺骗我们。如果碰到他们不高兴时，就说什么“‘仁慈堂’的门是开着的，当初也没人请你们来，不干你们可以随便走”。不仅如此，我们的自由也受到了限制。无事不能到里院去，不准出大门。他们什么时候叫，我们什么时候就得到。但帝国主义分子则饱食暖衣，吃的是面包黄油，喝的是咖啡、牛奶，用的是漂亮高贵的电气冰箱，出门就坐车，过着奢侈的生活。
    “仁慈堂”名义上是救济儿童的，但在这里的儿童和工人们一样，每天要从早工作到晚：织布、缝袜子、挑花。他们把儿童们作成的活计，好的运到外国出卖，普通的就在市场出卖。可是孩子们每天却吃不饱，穿不暖，挨打受骂，过着非人的生活，被他们无代价地剥削着。
    以上是“仁慈堂”帝国主义分子残害儿童和压迫、剥削我们的大概情形。我们不会写，就是会写，他们的罪恶也是写不完的。
    经过数月来的学习，我们的觉悟提高了，我们进一步认识了帝国主义分子的凶恶面目。我们盼望政府早日接办“仁慈堂”，把我们从帝国主义分子的魔掌里拯救出来，并严惩帝国主义分子。这是我们唯一的要求！

    西什库“仁慈堂”孤儿院儿童的控诉
    编辑同志：我是北京西什库“仁慈堂”孤儿院的一个孩子。我叫侯安定，今年十三岁。我来“仁慈堂”已有五年多了。我刚来的时候，帝国主义分子就叫我念经、背经，背不上来就把我放在黑屋子里用板子打。打完了再叫我跪着念；念不上来就打嘴巴。我十一岁的时候，开始叫我做袜子。做坏了就打我的手，把手都打青了。那年冬天因为我念圣经念不上来，帝国主义分子就把我赶到厕所里去做袜子，把我的手都冻得流血了。我把手搓一下取暖，他们就说我偷了线，一天不给我黑窝窝头吃。冬天让我挑煤球核，因为天冷，我搓了一下手，被他们看见了，就罚我跪在冰冷的花砖地上念经。第二天罚我管厕所，厕所水管子坏了，叫我赔。我赔不起就用板子把我的手打得直流血。编辑同志：我和其他姐妹受的苦，实在说不完。我要求政府惩办帝国主义分子，并盼望政府快快来接办“仁慈堂”。
        北京西什库“仁慈堂”孤儿院儿童侯安定
    编辑同志：我是北京西什库“仁慈堂”孤儿院的儿童。我要告诉你我在这里受的苦。我记得，我刚来这里，帝国主义分子就叫我缝袜子。我不会缝，缝坏了，他们把我拉到屋里，用藤条打了我一顿。有一次吃饭我砸了一个碗，以后他们就再也不给我碗用了。求了多少次，才给了我一个生锈的铁罐用。有时吃饭时叫我们喝些乱七八糟的汤，跟喂家畜的汤一样，难喝极啦。我们喝不下去，可是他们拿着柳木棍子站在一边看着，非喝不行，不喝就打。我在“仁慈堂”担任扫院子的工作。有一次天下大雨，我不能去扫。帝国主义分子用扫帚把我打下水去，在水里扫。作针线活时可不敢弄脏一点，弄脏一点就要挨踢，踢痛了还不敢哭。我们受的苦太多了，说几天也说不完。我希望政府赶快接办“仁慈堂”，并希望将我的信登出来。

   “仁慈堂”折磨死了我的堂妹王毓琴
    我的堂妹王毓琴死去已经五年了。我每每想起毓琴的死，就特别痛恨帝国主义者的野蛮残忍。
    远在抗日战争以前，我的伯母就把十三岁的女儿毓琴送进了北京西什库的“仁慈堂”。第二年，伯母病故了。以后，我每星期去看毓琴一趟，给她送些吃的、用的和穿的。每次我去看她时，总是见她不高兴，问一句才说一句，身体也瘦弱不堪。她个子不但不长，反倒缩小了。她长到十五、六岁的时候，看去却像七、八岁的样子。当时我想接她出来，但因为家境穷困，无能为力。后来在一个暑假中，我把她接出来住了一个多月。家里只有妹妹、她和我。妹妹和她同岁，看去却比她大一半。她总是抑郁不乐，沉默寡言。最初，我以为她是因为死了母亲的缘故，后来才知道她是在“仁慈堂”受尽了折磨弄成这样的。
    毓琴和其他寄养在西什库“仁慈堂”的孩子们，每天都要操作（包括擦地板——是跪在地板上用手拿抹布擦，扫院子，洗衣服等等），作工（织袜子，缝口袋等）。这些苦活，加在几岁和十几岁的儿童身上，可真不轻啊。但是，她们吃什么呢？每天除了窝窝头就是稀粥，有时连窝窝头也没有。那做窝窝头的面都生了一寸多长的肉虫子，窝窝头蒸得半生不熟，虫子一根一根地躺在上面。好的时候有菜，是些白水煮的烂白菜、烂萝卜。“仁慈堂”的苦孩子们不想吃，可是不吃不行，有“姑奶奶”（修女）看着。结果，孩子们吃饭时含着眼泪，又不敢哭（哭了就要挨“姑奶奶”的打）也不敢大声说话。
    “仁慈堂”有很好的庭院，可是不准孩子们在那里玩。当“姑奶奶”在一旁的时候，她们只能裂开嘴苦笑。“姑奶奶”走后，她们就闭上嘴呆若木鸡。当时，我看到毓琴的膝盖上有两块馒头大的很厚很厚的皮，就问她怎样长的。她含着眼泪胆怯地告诉我，那是每天跪着擦地板磨出来的。
    毓琴在家里住的时候，我常说她不活泼，不痛快。她走路总摔跤，其实这是病态。我因为家里穷，不能抚养她，终于又把她送回了火坑（现在真后悔），送她回“仁慈堂”的第二个星期，我去看她，她还能勉强地挣扎着走出来。我看她走路困难，仔细问她，才知道她腿痛。于是，我给她送去了棉裤，医药，给她治腿痛。第三个星期日，我又去看她，她已经不能走路了。“仁慈堂”不肯替她医治，我又无力接她出来就医，就这样病了两年，终于在她十九岁的那年，死在那万恶的挂羊头卖狗肉的“仁慈堂”中。
    毓琴活着的时候，在一个暑天的星期日，我去看她。在接见的小屋里，我总嗅到一种奇臭。我问她时，她偷偷地低声告诉我：旁边小屋里放有死孩子。我又问为什么堂里不告诉孩子的家长来收埋。她说死的这个孩子是“里书房”的（“外书房”住的孩子是有家的，还有点照顾；“里书房”住的孩子是没家的，比“外书房”更苦得多），没人管，死了就放在那里。因为堂里每天都有死孩子，所以要积三、四天，等到够装一个匣子时，再一起埋掉。
    我要控诉，控诉帝国主义的“慈善机关”残害我国的儿童。我永远忘不了毓琴是怎样死的，我要为毓琴控诉，为无数的被害的孩子控诉。在今天，在北京，我们不容许任何挂羊头卖狗肉、杀人不用刀的帝国主义的“慈善机关”继续残杀我国的儿童。我希望人民政府严正处理西什库“仁慈堂”的罪犯们，为受害的祖国的孩子们报仇。　王毓林
