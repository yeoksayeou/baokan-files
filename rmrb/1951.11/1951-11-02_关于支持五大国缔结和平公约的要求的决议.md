    Resolution on Supporting the Demand for the Five Great Powers to Conclude a Peace Pact
    The Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, based on the solemn will of the people of the whole country, as expressed by the signatures of over 344 million people to the "Declaration for the Conclusion of a Peace Pact," and in order to defend world peace and enhance friendly relations between countries, decides to express its firm support for the World Peace Council's proposal for the five great powers to conclude a peace pact.
    This conference notes that the World Peace Council's proposal has developed into a broad movement of all mankind. More than 560 million people worldwide have signed the "Declaration for the Conclusion of a Peace Pact." The Soviet government has twice proposed that the five great powers conclude a peace pact, and recently reiterated this proposal in the resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet on August 6, 1951, which demonstrates the lofty aspirations and unremitting efforts of the Soviet government and people to defend world peace. Therefore, as long as the United States, Britain, and France can also make the same decision, then the peace pact of the five great powers of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France can be concluded.
    This conference believes that the five-power peace pact should confirm that all disputes between countries in the world, including the Korean issue, the Japanese issue, the German issue, and the independence of colonies and dependent countries, should be resolved through peaceful negotiations. The five-power peace pact should determine the prohibition of atomic weapons and the universal reduction of armaments worldwide. Solving these urgent problems will save humanity from another catastrophe. This kind of pact should welcome the participation of all countries in the world.
    This conference calls on the people of China to continue to strive unremittingly for the conclusion of a five-power peace pact and calls on the governments and peoples of all countries in the world to work with us on this issue. November 1, 1951

    关于支持五大国缔结和平公约的要求的决议
    中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议，根据全国有三亿四千四百余万人签名于“缔结和平公约宣言”一事所表现的全国人民的庄严意志，为了保卫世界和平，增进各国间的友好关系，决定对于世界和平理事会关于五大国缔结和平公约的主张，表示坚决的支持。
    本会议注意到世界和平理事会的这个主张已发展为全人类的广泛运动。全世界已有五亿六千余万人民在“缔结和平公约宣言”上签名。苏联政府曾两度建议五大国缔结和平公约，最近复于最高苏维埃主席团一九五一年八月六日的决议中提出这个建议，这表示了苏联政府和人民对于保卫世界和平的崇高愿望和不断努力。因此，只要美国、英国和法国也能作同样的决定，那么，中华人民共和国、苏联、美国、英国和法国五大国的和平公约就有可能缔结。
    本会议认为：五大国和平公约应该确认世界各国间的一切争端，包括朝鲜问题、日本问题、德国问题、殖民地和附属国的独立问题，都应该用和平谈判的方式来求得解决。五大国和平公约应该确定原子武器的禁用和全世界军备的普遍缩减。解决这些迫切的问题，将使人类避免另一次浩劫。这种公约，应该欢迎世界所有国家参加。
    本会议要求全中国人民继续为缔结五大国和平公约而奋斗不懈，并呼吁世界各国政府和人民在这一个问题上与我们共同努力。一九五一年十一月一日
