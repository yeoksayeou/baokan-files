Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 9th: "Labor News" published on the 5th an essay by General Kim Il-sung commemorating the thirty-fourth anniversary of the October Revolution, entitled "The October Revolution and the Korean People's Struggle for National Liberation."

General Kim Il-sung wrote first: The victory of the great October Revolution, whether in the struggle against the Japanese plunderers or in today's struggle against the aggression of US imperialism and for unified independence, has had a tremendous and decisive impact on the development of the Korean national liberation movement. The victory of the October Revolution promoted and encouraged the Korean people and pointed the way to liberation for the Korean people. Under the influence of the October Revolution, the first uprising against the Japanese plunderers and for national independence took place in Korea in March 1919. The establishment of the Korean Communist Party in 1925 promoted the rapid development of the national liberation movement. In August 1945, the powerful Soviet army liberated our Korea after defeating the Japanese Kwantung Army.

The essay continued: Because the Soviet army liberated our Korea, a broad path to establishing an independent and democratic country was opened before our people. However, the United States established plans to enslave our country. General Kim Il-sung then recounted how the United States abandoned the resolution on the Korean issue of the Moscow Conference of the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, and finally launched the war.

General Kim Il-sung said: Our Korean people have been victoriously waging the Fatherland Liberation War against the armed aggressors of the imperialist plunderers—the United States and its satellite countries—for seventeen months. With the help of the Chinese People's Volunteers, we have broken the plans of the armed aggressors. The military strength of the United States has been severely hit. The political failure of the United States is even more disastrous. What are the basic reasons for our victory? First, the Korean people have been unprecedentedly united in the course of the war and have displayed a high degree of patriotism. Hatred of the plunderers and lofty patriotism have inspired the officers and soldiers of the People's Army to establish heroic feats on the front lines, and have inspired the working people in cities and rural areas to devote themselves to labor in the rear. The unity of the front and the rear is an important basis for our achievements. Second, we are not isolated in our just struggle. On our side, we have the assistance and active political support of the democratic camp headed by the great Soviet Union. Good people all over the world have expressed their sympathy for us. The most obvious manifestation of the help from the democratic camp is the assistance given to Korea by the Chinese People's Volunteers. The immortal achievements of the people of our great neighbor will always be remembered by the kind Korean people. The joint combat of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers is the guarantee of our confidence in victory. Third, an important reason for our victory lies in the growth and strengthening of our armed forces. In the seventeen months of the war, the Korean People's Army has developed and improved both in its numbers, its armed strength, and the combat quality of its officers and soldiers.

General Kim Il-sung concluded: The worldwide movement demanding that the United States stop its armed aggression against Korea is constantly expanding. In this environment, the US government had to agree to the armistice negotiation proposal put forward by Soviet Representative to the United Nations Malik. However, the US side has not shown a sincere desire to resolve the issue by peaceful means during the armistice negotiations. We have always advocated a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The attitude adopted by our delegation is the best proof. However, armistice negotiations can only succeed when the US side shows sincerity. Armed aggressors cannot intimidate us. If they break the armistice negotiations, we will fight to the end to defend the freedom and independence of our motherland. The continuation of the Korean War can only lead to the complete failure of the armed aggressors.

    十月革命与朝鲜人民的民族解放斗争
    ——金日成将军为纪念十月革命三十四周年而写的论文摘要
    【新华社平壤九日电】“劳动新闻”在五日发表金日成将军为纪念十月革命三十四周年而著的论文，题为“十月革命与朝鲜人民的民族解放斗争”。
    金日成将军首先写道：伟大的十月革命的胜利，对我国说来，不论在反对日本掠夺者的斗争时期，或在今天反对美帝国主义者的侵略、争取统一独立的斗争时期，都给了朝鲜民族解放运动的发展以巨大的决定性的影响。十月革命的胜利推动和鼓舞了朝鲜人民，给朝鲜人民指引了解放的道路。在十月革命的影响下，朝鲜在一九一九年三月发生了反对日本掠夺者、争取民族独立的第一次暴动。一九二五年朝鲜共产党的成立，推动了民族解放运动迅速发展。一九四五年八月，强有力的苏联军队在击败了日本关东军之后，解放了我们朝鲜。
    论文继续写道：由于苏联军队解放了我们朝鲜，在我们人民面前出现了建立独立的民主国家的广阔道路。但是，美国又建立了奴役我国的计划。金日成将军接着叙述了美国背弃苏、美、英三国外长莫斯科会议关于朝鲜问题的决议，并终于发动了战争的经过。
    金日成将军说：我们朝鲜人民已经在十七个月中，胜利地进行了反对帝国主义掠夺者——美国及其仆从国家武装侵略者的祖国解放战争。在中国人民志愿军的帮助下，我们打破了武装侵略者的计划。美国的军事力量遭到了沉重的打击。美国在政治上的失败更为惨重。我们胜利的基本原因在那里呢？一、朝鲜人民在战争过程中空前地团结起来，并发挥了高度的爱国主义精神。对掠夺者的敌忾和崇高的爱国主义精神，鼓舞了人民军官兵在前线建立英雄的功勋，鼓舞了城市和农村的劳动人民在后方献身地参加劳动。前线和后方的统一，是我们所获得的成就的重要基础。二、在我们的正义斗争中，我们不是孤立的。在我们的方面，有着以伟大的苏联为首的民主阵营的援助和积极的政治支持。全世界善良的人民对我们都表示了同情。来自民主阵营的帮助的最明显的表现，是中国人民志愿军给予朝鲜的援助。我们伟大邻邦人民的千秋不灭的业绩，将永远被善良的朝鲜人民记忆着。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的并肩作战，是我们的胜利信心的保证。三、我们胜利的重要原因在于我们的武装力量的增长和加强。在十七个月的战争中，朝鲜人民军不论在自己的数量上、武装力量上以及官兵的战斗质量上，都向前发展和提高了。
    金日成将军最后写道：全世界要求美国停止对朝鲜的武装侵略的运动不断地扩大着。在这种环境中，美国政府不得不对苏联驻联合国代表马立克所提的停战谈判建议表示同意。但是美国方面在停战谈判的过程中，没有表现出以和平方法来解决问题的真诚愿望。我们一贯主张和平解决朝鲜问题。我们代表团所采取的态度，就是最好的证明。但是，只有当美方表示出诚意时，停战谈判才有可能成功。武装侵略者是恐吓不了我们的。如果它们破坏停战谈判的话，我们将为保卫我们祖国的自由独立而斗争到底。朝鲜战争的继续，只能使武装侵略者遭到彻底的失败。
