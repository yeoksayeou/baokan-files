    Several Good Propaganda Methods in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement
    Propaganda Department of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    The Party branch of the coal washing plant of the Chemical Department of Anshan in Northeast China created many lively propaganda forms in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, which were warmly welcomed by the workers and promoted the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement. One of these propaganda forms is the "Challenge Dialogue Board." The propagandist first draws a piece of coal into a person, yelling: "I am a big coal lump from the mine. It took so many years to grow so big. Now my master has sent me here for you to process and support the Resistance Against America and Aid Korea. Can you guarantee it?" The workers of the coal washing machine and the coal crushing machine immediately drew the machine into a person to answer: "Our master has already contacted your master. We guarantee to process you well and give full play to your strength in Resistance Against America and Aid Korea! We dare to guarantee it!" This has a great motivating effect on the workers. The workers said after reading it: "We must process it well and match the coal well." Worker Qu Lianqing dozed off at work, and the machine scratched the belt. The propagandist immediately drew a cartoon of "The Belt Accusing the Master." "Broken Belt" said: "My master dozes off at work and doesn't take care of me, which caused me to be seriously injured, shortened my life, and affected production. Do you think he should be criticized?" This deeply criticized and educated Qu Lianqing. Another propaganda method of detailed accounting is also very good. In the past, coal trucks were often not cleaned thoroughly, resulting in great losses. The propagandist calculated for everyone: "Each truck always leaves 25 kilograms of coal each time. The remaining coal on 100 trucks every day is equal to the wages of 55 workers for one day." The employees were shocked and said: "We must keep detailed accounts in the future. Managing a factory is like a family living a life. We must be careful and meticulous." After the "detailed accounting," the coal trucks were cleaned. At the same time, after "detailed accounting," the ash content of coal washing also decreased from 7.2% to 6.25%, which fully met the standard required for coking. The workers also created propaganda methods such as the honor roll. These propaganda methods encouraged the workers' enthusiasm for production, so that everyone has been maintaining full enthusiasm for production. Therefore, it was guaranteed that 160% of the task of increasing production and practicing economy was completed in August, and 300% was completed in September. This made all employees full of confidence in completing the task of "increasing production and practicing economy by 118 tons of grain by the end of 1951." We believe that this propaganda and mobilization method is worth promoting.

    增产节约运动中的几种好的宣传方式
    中共鞍山市委宣传部
    东北鞍山化工部洗煤厂党支部在增产节约运动中，创造了很多生动活泼的宣传形式，受到工人群众的热烈欢迎，推进了增产节约运动。这些宣传形式中，有一种是“挑战对话板”。宣传员先把煤块画成一个人，张嘴大叫道：“我是矿山大煤块，经过多少年代才长这样大，现在主人把我送到你们这里来加工，支援抗美援朝，你们能保证吗？”洗煤机和破煤机的工人马上把机器画成一个人来回答道：“我们的主人早跟你的主人联系好了，保证把你加工好，发挥你的抗美援朝的力量，敢向你保证！”这对工人群众的鼓动作用很大。工人群众看了说：“一定要好好加工，好好配煤。”工人曲连庆在工作中打盹，机器划破了皮带，宣传员马上画了一张“皮带控诉主人”的漫画。“破皮带”说：“我主人在工作时光打盹，不看管我，以致我受了重伤，缩短了我的寿命，影响了生产，大家说他应该不应该受到批评？”这就很深刻地批评和教育了曲连庆。还有一种算细账的宣传方式也很好。过去煤车常常打扫不净，损失很大。宣传员就给大家算账说：“每辆车上每次总剩二十五公斤煤，每天一百辆车上的剩煤，就等于五十五个工人一天的工资。”职工们听了大吃一惊说：“以后可要算细账。咱们管理工厂，就跟一家人过日子一样，非细打细算不行。”经过“算细账”以后，煤车打扫干净了。同时经过“算细账”，洗煤灰分亦由百分之七·二降低到百分之六·二五，完全达到了炼焦要求的标准。工人们还创造了光荣榜等宣传方式。这些宣传方式鼓舞了工人群众的生产热情，使大家一直保持着饱满的生产热情。因而保证了八月份完成增产节约百分之一百六十的任务，九月份则完成了百分之三百。这样使全体职工对完成“在一九五一年年底增产节约一百一十八吨粮食”的任务充满了信心。我们认为这种宣传鼓动方式是值得推广的。
