    I Urgently Need to Study and Transform
    Hu Weibai, Professor, North China University of Technology
    (I) Climbing Upward and Expert Ideology
    At the beginning of the study movement for teachers in Beijing and Tianjin universities, I only felt that Premier Zhou's report was very kind and moving. However, when it came to criticizing my own thoughts, I always felt that I had only been reading, researching, and teaching, and it seemed difficult to raise any issues.
    After a period of self-study, enlightenment, and discussion, I gradually extracted some clues from the tangled thoughts that I used to consider "taken for granted." I realized my past mistakes and became alert to the danger of allowing these errors to develop if I did not study and transform myself as soon as possible.
    I was born into a petty-bourgeois family, and my father was a middle school teacher. Because the family's finances were always insufficient to make ends meet, and I personally experienced and witnessed the suffering of farmers, I was determined from a young age to "revitalize the family business and make a name for myself"; to escape farming or being an apprentice, and to climb upward; and I even had the "ambition" to "sympathize" and "help" them after I had climbed above them.
    My father often talked about Zeng Guofan and Liang Qichao. I loved reading "The Family Letters of Zeng Wenzheng" and "Essays from the Ice-Drinker's Studio," and I often pondered their "secrets to success" in my heart. Therefore, I studied diligently and often participated in student activities.
    My participation in student activities, in addition to wanting to show off and vent my frustrations, was often inspired by the stories of Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao's "petition to the emperor in a public carriage" and Luo Jialun, Fu Sinian, and others climbing upward by taking advantage of the "May Fourth" movement. I was sometimes quite impassioned in front of the masses, but I became gentle and refined at critical moments. So, I got to show off, but the school wouldn't expel me. I was in junior high school in the North when the "December 9th" Movement took place; I was in high school in Zhejiang when the New Fourth Army was developing rapidly in southern Anhui. Some classmates resolutely went to revolution, while I attended enthusiastic discussions and sent them off with tears, but declined to follow. Because I wanted personal "sufficiency in food and clothing, and to glorify my ancestors." I felt that the path of "excelling in learning to become an official" was much more stable than participating in the revolution.
    The path of "excelling in learning to become an official" gradually became clear when I entered university under Chen Lifu's loan policy of buying off and paralyzing young people. That was that I wanted to become a "metallurgical expert"! Having specialized technology could not only provide sufficiency in food and clothing but also allow me to wait for an opportunity to act and gain fame and fortune. Under the "expert" ideology, I reversed my past opportunistic approach of actively participating in student activities and focused on studying. I looked down on all left and right parties, groups, and societies, feeling that "saving the country through technology" and "saving the country through industry" were the fundamental solutions, and everything else was abandoning the essential for the trivial.
    After graduating from university and entering a research institution, my goal was to become "more of an expert," with the secondary goal of being ready to apply for studying abroad at any time.
    In short, I took personal fame and fortune as my starting point and used studying and research as a means. The ideas of "saving the country through industry" and being an "expert" had sprouted and taken root.

    (II) From Reformism to a Middle Ground
    After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, I went to Beijing, and life forced me to realize that being an "expert" could very well lead to starvation. Thus, starting from my personal future, I became concerned about the social effects of science and even politics.
    On the one hand, I borrowed and read the Xinhua Daily and progressive books; on the other hand, I also read newspapers run by the Kuomintang reactionaries, thinking that I was analyzing the situation very "scientifically" and "objectively."
    What I found more agreeable was the "Ta Kung Pao" and "Observer" magazine, which praised and criticized the Kuomintang at the same time, criticizing lightly and praising heavily. Before the pseudo-National Assembly was convened, my idea was: the Kuomintang is bad, but wouldn't overthrowing it be too much effort and easily cause great chaos? It would be better to reform it.
    How to reform it? "Good people's government," "rural construction," "saving the country through education," "saving the country through industry"... all made sense and were better than armed struggle.
    At that time, I felt that the fundamental problems were "scientific construction and industrialization." Why? To be rich and strong and stable, the people must first have sufficient food and clothing; to have sufficient food and clothing, there must be industrialization; to have industrialization, there must be technicians; to have technicians, I must be invited to come out. This was my logic for saving the country.
    At that time, Hu Shi gave a speech at Yenching University, telling young people to dream; Yan Yangchu was shouting "rural revitalization." Among the professors in Beijing, some talked about complete Westernization, some talked about visiting the United States, visiting England, and "rebuilding the countryside," and some wrote letters to Wedemeyer. I was very confused at the time. I also hoped that many industrial technicians would organize to jointly discuss the great plan of national construction, and based on my knowledge of the damage caused by the war to industry, I "objectively" wrote articles and submitted them to the "Ta Kung Pao" and "Observer," which I admired at the time, advocating against the civil war. At that time, some people thought that I had a progressive side, but in reality, I was just a muddled and reactionary reformist. I was only against the civil war, but I did not point out the significance of the people's liberation struggle; I did not deeply hate the reactionary government, I was completely irresponsible, writing articles for稿费and fame. I hate myself for this kind of behavior.
    Later, the civil war expanded, and by the end of 1947, the more I looked at the Kuomintang, the more it seemed to be crumbling, rotten wood that could not be carved. I felt that it was not easy to reform on this foundation, and I was very pessimistic. In addition to pessimism, I placed my hopes on the following at that time:
    (1) Relying on some "scholars" centered on Americans such as John Leighton Stuart to implement democracy.
    (2) Like the British Labour Party line advocated by certain professors, pushing China towards "socialism" without effort or bloodshed.
    At that time, a certain philosophy professor published the theory that "capitalism has no economic freedom, and communism has no freedom of will." I thought it was a real philosophy. I felt that only by taking the middle road could I retreat and protect myself wisely, and advance to muddle through and climb upward.
    In the past, I always thought that although the middle road of reformism was a failure, it also had a progressive side. After the discussion and study of the "Wu Xun Biography" issue two years after liberation, I clearly realized the reactionary nature of these ideas and the petty-bourgeois vacillation and compromise in me.
    I incidentally requested the professors who I admired and promoted these views at the time to make self-criticisms, because they had a responsibility to dispel the confused ideas in the minds of many who had been misled.

    (III) Worshiping America and "Patriotism"
    I obtained the qualification for studying abroad from the pseudo-Ministry of Education and went to the United States in 1948. At a time when people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas were in chaos and worried about rice and firewood, the sight of the surface of the United States gave rise to a sense of worshiping America. Studying in the United States, the objective conditions for my "expert" ideology matured, so I began to study with peace of mind, ignoring everything else. The goal was to get a "master's" degree first, then a "doctorate," and then return to China in glory.
    Although I admired American civilization in my heart, because I was very poor when I first arrived in the United States and could not adapt to that luxurious life, I developed a sense of dissatisfaction and resentment, saying that the United States was not good in this way and that I did not appreciate it in that way... At the same time, I said that China was good at any time and in any place. At that time, I thought I was being patriotic and taking a national stance, but now, analyzing it, it is actually not much different from the "Ah Q mentality" described by Lu Xun.
    At that time, I also paid attention to the ways to save the country studied by Chinese and foreign "scholars" in the United States: such as "China's population is too large and should control fertility," "Chinese people have poor morals and should strengthen the promotion of Christianity and build more YMCAs," "Chinese people are poor, sick, and ignorant, and should promote rural construction," "China lacks the same democracy and science as the United States, so more students should be sent to study abroad so that the students can lead reforms after returning"... Of course, there were also progressive elements among the students studying in the United States who pointed out the main path of "anti-feudalism, anti-imperialism, and liberation struggle."
    When I first arrived in the United States, I focused on studying. When progressive classmates came to talk, I used a set of theories from reactionary "scholars" to argue; when reactionary "scholars" came to talk, I used the theories of progressive classmates to argue. The conclusion was: it's still best to study diligently.
    After the Liaoshen and Huaihai campaigns, the Kuomintang reactionary government stopped paying the expenses of students studying abroad. During the summer vacation, I had to wash dishes in restaurants and pick fruit on farms to earn some money to maintain my life and tuition. I had no hope for the reactionaries, and the dawn of victory was clear. The petty bourgeoisie had no room to waver. I myself did not have much "vested interest," and I personally saw apples rotting on the trees and potatoes being sprayed with poison, while the unemployed on the streets were starving. I also lost my nostalgia for the United States. I felt that I had to lean towards progressive forces, so I asked for books and newspapers from home and discussed with progressive classmates. I have made some changes, and I have made some progress; I feel warm in my heart, and I feel that China has a turning point and the Communist Party has a way. However, on the one hand, I want to be actively progressive, and on the other hand, I am afraid of being accused of being opportunistic, which will damage my integrity. This mentality is still manifested in my contradiction of whether to participate in a democratic party and whether I should lean towards the organization, fully demonstrating my petty-bourgeois state of anxiety.
    Due to the victory of the motherland's revolution, I subjectively had the idea of ​​wanting to return to the country to serve, and I called on other students to return to the country. However, when the University of California gave me a scholarship and a small position, I accepted the "gift" with no position under the guise of "the country is still very chaotic, I can't help now, my family has to bear the burden, I can earn some dollars here, and learn more technology," until the Korean War broke out, fearing that the situation would be unfavorable to me, and then I packed up and returned to the country.
    The gains from the "study in the United States" period, in addition to learning some "theories" that were not very suitable for China's reality and obtaining the qualifications for me to ask the people for more millet, were to make my "expert" ideology more deeply rooted and to have a strong pro-American viewpoint.

    (IV) This Past Year
    In the year or so since returning to the country, with the help of many progressive friends, although I have made some progress, I still have many serious defects in my thinking. For example:
    (1) I say that I want to sacrifice everything to serve the people in words, but in reality, I am calculating fame and fortune, calculating the good or bad of job positions, not working with peace of mind, and I also have the view of "bestowing" technology on the motherland. For example, when I visited various ore dressing plants in the Northeast, people politely called me "professor" and "expert," and I became arrogant and regarded myself as an "expert," not knowing how to learn humbly. At school, I am also self-important to colleagues and peers.
    (2) I criticize the United States in words, but in reality, I often think about the "treatment" and laboratories that the United States gave me, and I am unwilling to learn the advanced experience of the Soviet Union humbly.
    (3) I say that I want to do a good job in business with humility in words, but in reality, I have a sense of superiority and feel that I have a new set of things. My teaching content and methods are divorced from reality, but I also emphasize that "I don't know how to connect."
    (4) I say that I want to study politics in words, but in reality, I always feel that political study hinders my business and seriously opposes politics and business.

    (V) Review and Outlook
    The more I examine myself carefully, the more I feel chilling.
    Because I am in a relatively high position in the petty bourgeoisie, if my selfish and self-interested thinking of climbing upward continues to develop, I will replace the national and people's position with a personal position whenever there is an opportunity.
    Because I am already a so-called "senior intellectual," if my sense of superiority and purely technical views continue to develop, I will become an accomplice or helper of the reactionaries, regardless of whether they are enemies or friends, whenever there is an opportunity.
    Because I am a student who studied in the United States, if my pro-American thinking is not eradicated, I will unconsciously become a comprador class or a running dog of imperialism whenever there is an opportunity.
    What's more, I am now standing in an educational position, responsible for training construction cadres for the people's motherland!
    Although I have not climbed on the heads of the people in the past, I have also ridden on the necks of the people. Now I want to climb down and stand on equal footing with the people and serve them wholeheartedly.
    The way to transform myself is to study, that is, criticism and self-criticism. I want to study patriotism and internationalism, to combine theory with practice, business with politics, and to learn to use the position, viewpoints, and methods of Marxism-Leninism as a guide for future work.
    The specific work in front of me, such as resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, increasing production and practicing economy, reforming the school system, reforming curriculum content and teaching methods, will all give me a test.
    The glorious achievements of the motherland's construction in the past two years and the call of the heroic volunteers have made me experience the superiority of the New Democracy and eliminated the pessimism and sentimentality peculiar to old intellectuals. I want to transform myself and move forward with the Communist Party with confidence.

专栏：

    我迫切需要学习和改造
    华北大学工学院教授  胡为柏
    （一）向上爬与专家思想
    在这次北京天津高等学校教师学习运动刚开始时，我只觉得周总理的报告很亲切动人，但要联系批判自己思想时，总觉得过去只是读书、研究、教书，好像提不出问题。
    经过一段时期的自学、启发、讨论，我才逐渐将千丝万缕过去认为“想当然”的思想意识抽出点头绪，认识了过去的错误，警觉到如不及早学习改造，让错误发展下去是很危险的。
    我出身于小资产阶级，父亲是个中学教员。因为家庭经济总是入不敷出，又亲历和目睹农民的痛苦，从小就决心要“振兴家业、显亲扬名”；要逃脱种田或做小学徒的生活，往上爬；并且还有等自己爬到他们头上去之后再去“同情”“帮助”他们的“雄心”。
    我的父亲常常谈什么曾国藩，也谈梁启超，我爱读“曾文正公家书”，也爱读“饮冰室文集”等书，心中常常在忖度他们的“成功之道”。所以我勤心苦读，而也时常参加学生活动。
    我之参加学生活动，除了想出风头及出出自己穷气之外，心中常想起康有为、梁启超的“公车上书”以及罗家伦、傅斯年等利用“五四”运动往上爬的故事的。我在群众面前有时也颇慷慨激昂，但到紧要关头就温文尔雅；所以出风头有我，但学校不会开除我。在北方念初中，当时正值“一二九”运动；在浙江念高中，当时新四军正在皖南大发展；有的同学坚决地走向革命，而我是热烈座谈，含泪送行，恕不追随。因为我要个人“丰衣足食，光宗耀祖”。我觉得“学而优则仕”的路比参加革命稳当得多。
    “学而优则仕”的路，到我在陈立夫收买麻痹青年的贷金政策下进了大学时，逐渐明确了，那就是我要做“冶金专家”！有专门技术不仅可丰衣足食，还可待机而动，得到名利。在“专家”思想下，我一反过去积极参加学生活动的投机办法，而专心读书，对于什么左右党团会社，一概看不起，只觉得“技术救国”“工业救国”才是根本之图，其他都是舍本逐末。
    大学毕业后进了研究机关，我的努力目标就是要自己“更专家”些，附带的目标就是随时准备投考留学。
    总之，我是以个人名利为出发点，以求学研究作为手段而已。“工业救国”和“专家”思想已发芽生根了。
    （二）由改良主义到中间立场
    抗战胜利后，我到北京，生活逼得我惊觉到当“专家”很有被饿死的可能，于是由个人前途出发，关心起科学的社会效果以至政治来。
    我一面借阅新华日报及进步书籍，一面又看国民党反动派办的报纸，自己以为很“科学”、很“客观”地在分析时局。
    觉得比较合意的就是当时对国民党又捧又骂、小骂大捧的“大公报”和“观察”杂志。在伪国大未召开前，我的想法是：国民党是不好，但要推翻它不是太费力而易引起大乱吗，还是加以改良来得好。
    怎么改良呢？“好人政府”“乡村建设”“教育救国”“工业救国”……都有道理，都比武装斗争好。
    我当时觉得根本问题是“科学建设和工业化”，为什么呢？要富强安定就先要老百姓丰衣足食，要丰衣足食就要工业化，要工业化就要技术人员，要技术人员就要请我出来，这就是我的救国逻辑。
    当时胡适在燕京大学讲演，叫青年做梦；晏阳初在喊“农村复兴”。北京教授中有谈全般欧化的，有谈访美、访英、“乡土重建”的，有向魏德迈写信的。我当时很受迷惑，我还希望许多工业技术人员组织起来共同讨论建国大计，并且就我所知战争对于工业的损坏情形，“客观地”写成文章投向当时我所钦仰的“大公报”和“观察”，鼓吹反内战。当时有人以为我有进步的一面，实际上我只是糊涂而反动的改良主义者。我仅是反内战，但并未指出人民解放斗争的意义；对反动政府也未深恶痛绝，我完全毫不负责，为稿费为出名而写文章，我痛恨自己这种作法。
    后来内战扩大了，到一九四七年末，愈看国民党愈是摇摇欲坠，朽木不可雕了；我觉得在这基础上改良不容易，很悲观；悲观之余，当时寄希望如下：
    （一）依靠以美国人司徒雷登等为中心的一些“学者”出来实行民主。
    （二）如某些教授所宣传的英国工党路线那样，不费力不流血地将中国推向“社会主义”。
    当时某哲学教授发表“资本主义无经济自由，共产主义无意志自由”的理论，我认为是真正的哲理。觉得只有走中间路线，退可明哲保身，进可混水摸鱼往上爬。
    过去我总以为改良主义中间路线虽是失败，但也有其进步的一面。解放两年后经过“武训传”问题的讨论和学习，我才明确认识这些思想的反动本质和我的小资产阶级的动摇性妥协性。
    我附带要求当时为我所钦佩、宣扬这些观点的教授们作检讨，因为他们有责任来解除许多受迷惑者的思想上的糊涂观念。
    （三）崇美与“爱国”
    我考得伪教育部留学资格，一九四八年就出国赴美。在国民党统治区人民乱纷纷愁米愁柴之际，一见美国的表面，崇美之念油然而起。留美，我那“专家”思想的客观条件成熟了，于是我又万事不管心安理得地读起书来，目标是先“硕士”后“博士”再荣返中国。
    虽然我心底羡慕美国的文明，但因为我初抵美国时经济很窘迫，不能适应那种豪华生活，就由苦闷而起反感，说美国这样不好，那样我不欣赏……同时随时随地说中国好。当时自己以为是爱国，是民族立场，现在分析起来，实际上与鲁迅描写的“阿Q心理”差得不多。
    当时我也注意在美国的中外“学者”所研究的救国之道：如“中国人口过剩要节制生育”，“中国人道德心差，要加强宣传基督教和多办青年会”，“中国老百姓贫、病、愚，要提倡乡村建设”，“中国缺乏美国一样的民主和科学，所以要多派留学生，使留学生回去后领导改革”……等等。当然留美同学中亦有进步分子指出“反封建反帝解放斗争”的大路的。
    初到美国，我专心读书，有进步同学来谈，我用反动“学者”的一套理论去辩驳；有反动“学者”来谈，我又用进步同学的理论去辩驳，结论是：还是切切实实念书好。
    经过了辽沈淮海战役，国民党反动政府对留学生的费用停发了，在暑假期内就不得不去餐馆洗碗，到农场摘水果，赚点钱来维持生活和学费。对于反动派既没有希望，胜利的曙光又已明朗，小资产阶级没有摇摆余地了。我自己没有多大的“既得利益”，又亲眼看到苹果在树上腐烂，马铃薯被喷上毒药，而街上失业者在挨饿的情景，对美国也失去留恋，自己觉得非向进步力量靠拢不可，于是向国内要书报看，与进步同学讨论。是有些转变了，是进步了一些；心里热烘烘地，觉得中国有转机，共产党有办法。然而一方面是想积极进步，另一方面又怕人家骂投机，有损我的清高。这种心理到现在还表现在我是否参加民主党派和是否应靠拢组织的矛盾上，充分显示我小资产阶级的惶遽状态。
    由于祖国革命的胜利，我在主观上有了要求回国服务的思想，并呼吁其他同学回国，然而当美国加省大学给我一笔奖学金和小职位时，我就在“国内还很乱，现在回去帮不上忙，我家庭要负担，我在此赚点美金，再多学点技术”的伪装下，毫无立场地接受了“恩赐”，直至朝鲜战事发生，怕形势对我不利，才束装归国。
    “留美”一段的收获，除了学得一些不甚切合中国实际的“理论”，和求得我向人民要更多小米的资格之外，就是使我的“专家”思想更根深蒂固，并有了浓厚的崇美观点。
    （四）这一年来
    回国一年多，在许多进步朋友的帮助下，我虽然有了某些进步，但在思想上还有不少严重的缺陷。例如：
    （一）口头说要牺牲一切为人民服务；但实际上计较着名利，计较工作岗位的好坏，不安心工作，并且还有将技术“恩赐”给祖国的观点。例如我到东北各选矿厂参观，人家客气地称我“教授”“专家”，我也就自高自大以“专家”自居、不知虚心学习。在学校对同事对同行亦是自命不凡。
    （二）口头上批判美国，但实际上时常想着美国对我的“待遇”、实验室等等，对苏联先进经验不肯虚心服气地去学习。
    （三）口头上说要虚心搞好业务，但实际上我有着一种优越感，觉得我自己有一套新东西。我在教学内容和方法上是脱离实际的，可是还强调“不晓得怎样联系法”。
    （四）口头上说要学习政治，但实际上我总觉得政治学习妨碍我的业务，将政治和业务严重地对立起来。
    （五）回顾和瞻望
    我愈仔细检查，愈感不寒而栗。
    因为我是小资产阶级中较有地位的，我的自私自利向上爬的思想要是继续发展，一有机会，就会以个人立场去代替民族及人民立场。
    因为我已是所谓“高级知识分子”，我的优越感和纯技术观点如果继续发展，一有机会，就会不分敌我地做反动派的帮凶或帮闲。
    因为我是留美学生，我的崇美思想要是不根除，一有机会，就会不自觉地做了买办阶级或帝国主义的走狗。
    何况我现在是站在教育岗位上，负有为人民祖国训练建设干部的任务！
    我过去虽未爬到人民头上，但也已骑在人民颈上了。现在要爬下来同人民站平，并全心全意为他们服务。
    自我改造的方法就是学习，就是批评和自我批评。我要学习爱国主义和国际主义，要使理论结合实际，业务结合政治，要学习运用马克思列宁主义的立场观点和方法作为今后工作的指南。
    摆在我面前的抗美援朝，增产节约工作；改革学制，改革课程内容和教学方法等具体工作都将给我以考验。
    两年来祖国建设的辉煌成就，英勇的志愿军的感召，使我体验到新民主主义的优越性，使我消除了旧知识分子所特有的悲观和伤感。我要改造自己，充满信心地随着共产党前进。
