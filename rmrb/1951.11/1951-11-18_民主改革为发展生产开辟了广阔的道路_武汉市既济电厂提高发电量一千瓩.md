　　Democratic Reform Opens Up Broad Prospects for Production Development
    Wuhan Jiji Power Plant Increases Power Generation by 1,000 Kilowatts
    Through the joint efforts of the employees of the Wuhan Jiji Hydroelectric Power Company's power plant, the potential capacity of the machines has been tapped, increasing power generation by 1,000 kilowatts, equivalent to adding a generator worth 5 billion yuan.

    The Jiji Power Plant has a history of 45 years from its construction to the present. During the rule of warlords, bureaucrats, Japanese imperialism, and Kuomintang reactionaries, workers suffered all kinds of cruel exploitation and oppression, and there was no way to talk about developing the potential capacity of machinery and equipment. According to the design and manufacturing standards of the original manufacturers, two generators could continuously operate with overload of several kilowatts, each generator capable of increasing its nominal load (the nameplate indicates the machine's performance specifications) by 750 kilowatts. However, during the period when British imperialist engineers installed the machines and managed production, Chinese workers were never allowed to know the internal conditions of the machines. When Japanese invaders occupied Wuhan, they sent Japanese engineers who reduced the output of these two machines by 20% of their nominal load. In addition, feudal bosses each dominated their own areas, creating various factions among the workers. The workers were disunited, and the production process was fragmented. The steam pressure in the boiler room was supposed to be burned to 175 pounds according to regulations, but it was actually only burned to 150 pounds. After the Japanese surrendered, the company was taken over by the bureaucratic capital system of Song Ziwen, who even burned the original charts on the machines, and some valuable machines were stolen for private use.

    After liberation, the consciousness of the workers and staff gradually increased, and the coal consumption rate gradually decreased from 2.13 kilograms before liberation to 1.126 kilograms in the first quarter of this year. However, because the hidden counter-revolutionary elements and feudal bosses in the factory still oppressed the masses, and the management system of the bureaucratic enterprise had not been fundamentally changed, the various potential capacities in the factory were still not well developed.

    In the democratic struggle against feudal remnants, the factory's workers and staff fully exposed and criticized the corruption of the bureaucratic enterprise, initially reformed the production management organization, and established a production command and dispatch responsibility system. When overhauling a certain vehicle, the task was completed three days ahead of schedule in accordance with the specifications set by the Central Government, and the test run before National Day was good. The coal consumption rate in September also dropped to 0.971 kg. At the accident recollection forum of the safety inspection, veteran worker Wu Aqing used factual comparisons to analyze the differences between the old and new societies, and came to the conclusion: "In the old society, workers were treated like grass, while in the new society, workers are treated like treasures. Brothers, we must take good care of the machines." All the workers and staff unanimously expressed their determination to strictly abide by the safety regulations and special responsibility system, to ensure that the power is never cut off for even one second, to strive for bonuses, and to donate aircraft and artillery to support the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    In the democratic reform, the workers and staff increasingly felt the need to learn technology; the technical personnel increasingly felt the need to learn practical experience from the workers. Before the major overhaul this time, in accordance with the regulations of the Central Government, everyone held a meeting to study; the operations personnel told everyone in detail about the operating conditions of these two old machines for decades, so that the repair personnel could find the source of the disease, overcoming the past problems of mutual disconnection between the repair personnel and the operations personnel, and also overcoming the phenomenon of disconnection between the engineering personnel and the workers. As a result, the quality of the major overhaul was improved and the task was completed ahead of schedule.

    After the leading cadres called for tapping potential capacity, the engineering personnel and the workers responded to this call, worked together with one heart and one mind, and repaired the dilapidated machines. During the test run, the workers in the boiler room guaranteed to burn the air pressure up to 175 pounds, the workers in the electrical field closely watched the changes of various meters, the workers in the steam field closely grasped the operation of the steam turbine, the repair masters guarded and adjusted the valve, and the shift foreman paid attention to the load distribution. Everyone had precise division of labor, echoed each other, and worked together. On the evening of October 6, the output of the machine increased by 1,000 kilowatts compared with the nameplate. These two machines have been operating completely normally from October 14 to the present, and the coal consumption rate has further dropped to 0.934 kg.

    On November 5, the factory held a celebration meeting at the same time as celebrating the October Revolution. The workers and staff who participated in the work donated all the 100 million yuan of bonuses they received to purchase weapons. The meeting unanimously responded to Chairman Mao's call at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to "increase production and practice economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers," and decided to continue to implement the democratic reform movement and put forward the slogan "continue to tap potential capacity and ensure safe operation" on the basis of the existing production. The Central and Southern China Electric Power Industry Union has notified the Central and Southern China power plants to learn from the Jiji Power Plant's example of tapping the potential capacity of machines.

### 民主改革为发展生产开辟了广阔的道路  武汉市既济电厂提高发电量一千瓩

　　民主改革为发展生产开辟了广阔的道路
    武汉市既济电厂提高发电量一千瓩
    武汉既济水电公司发电厂职工共同努力，发挥机器潜在能力，提高发电量一千瓩，等于增加了一部价值五十亿元的发电机。
    既济电厂自建厂到现在已有四十五年的历史。在军阀、官僚、日本帝国主义和国民党反动派统治时代，工人受尽各式各样的残酷剥削与压迫，根本谈不到发挥机器设备的潜在能力。有两个发电机按原制造厂设计制造标准，可以连续超负荷运行若干瓩，每部发电机可比名牌（名牌是说明机器性能规格的牌子）负荷量提高七百五十瓩。但过去英帝国主义工程师安装机器和管理生产时期，根本不让中国工人知道机器内部情况。日寇侵占武汉，派来日籍工程师，又将这两部机器的出力，按名牌负荷量打了八折。加以封建把头各霸一方，在工人中间制造各种帮派，工人不团结，生产过程弄得四分五裂。锅炉房的汽压，按规定应烧到一百七十五磅，但实际只烧到一百五十磅。日寇投降后，该公司为宋子文系统的官僚资本接收，竟把机器上原有的图表都烧毁了，一些贵重机器也被盗为私有。
    解放以后，职工的觉悟逐步提高，煤耗率由解放前的二点一三公斤逐步降到今年第一季的一点一二六公斤。但因厂内潜伏的反革命分子和封建把头仍然压在群众头上，官僚企业的管理制度仍未从根本上改变过来，所以厂内各种潜在能力，还是没有很好的发挥出来。
    在反封建残余的民主斗争中，该厂职工充分地暴露和批判了官僚企业的腐败，初步改革了生产管理机构，建立了生产指挥调度责任制。大检修某号车时，按照中央制定规格，提前三天完成任务，国庆节前夕试车良好。九月份的燃煤率也降到了零点九七一公斤。在保安大检查的事故回忆座谈会上，老工人邬阿青用事实对比，分析了新旧社会之不同，得出一个结论：“旧社会把工人当成草，新社会把工人当成宝，兄弟们：我们要把机器爱护好。”全体职工一致表示坚决遵守安全规程和专责制度，作到一秒钟也不停电，争取超额奖金，捐献飞机大炮，支持中国人民志愿军。
    工人在民主改革中，越来越感到需要学习技术；技术人员越来越感到需要向工人学习实际经验。这次按照中央规定，进行大检修前，大家先开会研究；运行人员把几十年来这两部老机器的运行情况详细告诉大家，使修理人员摸到病源，克服了过去修理人员与运行人员互不相干的毛病，也克服了工程人员与工人脱节的现象，因而大检修质量提高，并提前完成任务。
    领导干部号召发挥潜在能力后，工程人员与工人响应这一号召，同心协力，修理破旧机器。试车时，锅炉房的工人保证把气压烧高到一百七十五磅，电气场工人密切注意各种表计的变化，汽机场的工人紧紧掌握汽机运转情况，修理师傅守着调整气门，值班班长注意负荷调配，大家精确分工，互相呼应，协同动作，在十月六日晚上该机出力比名牌提高了一千瓩。这两部机器从十月十四日到现在，运转完全正常，燃煤率更下降到零点九三四公斤。
    十一月五日，该厂与庆祝十月革命节同时，举行庆功大会。参加工作的职工们把领到的一亿元人民币奖金，全部捐献出来，购买武器。会上一致响应毛主席在人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议上提出的“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的号召，决定继续贯彻民主改革运动，并在现有生产基础上，提出“继续发挥潜在能力，保证安全运转”的口号。中南电业工会已通报中南各电厂，向既济电厂学习发挥机器的潜在能力的榜样。
