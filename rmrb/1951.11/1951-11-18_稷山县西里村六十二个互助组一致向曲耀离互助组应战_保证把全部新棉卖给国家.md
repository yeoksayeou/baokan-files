Sixty-two mutual aid teams in Xili Village, Jishan County, unanimously accept the challenge from the Qu Yaoli mutual aid team
Guaranteeing to sell all new cotton to the state

Comrades of the Qu Yaoli mutual aid team: After reading your letter of challenge regarding patriotic cotton sales, we enthusiastically discussed it. All sixty-two mutual aid teams in the village unanimously agreed to accept your challenge. We have had a bumper cotton harvest this year, with an average yield per mu reaching the level before the War of Resistance, and in some cases exceeding the pre-war level. This is entirely due to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao leading us to organize and improve farming techniques, as well as the help of our elder brother workers. Now that the country needs cotton, we are determined to sell all our new cotton to the state to support industry and build the motherland. Our terms of acceptance are as follows: (1) All the new cotton picked, except for the necessary cotton for quilts, will be sold to the state, guaranteeing the quality to be dry, clean, and white. (2) We guarantee to pick, dry, pick out impurities, gin, and sell quickly, and to sell cotton collectively (by village or team), delivering cotton to the cooperative every five days, ensuring that all picking and selling is completed by the end of December. (3) To prepare conditions for a bumper cotton harvest next year, we guarantee to carry out field selection universally, selecting plants and seeds, and retaining "S" cotton seeds, guaranteeing that all "S" cotton seeds will be used next year. Regarding the above terms of acceptance, our mutual aid teams not only guarantee to do it ourselves but also lead the twenty-seven individual farmers in the village to do the same.

All members of the sixty-two mutual aid teams in Xili Village, Jishan County, Shanxi

　　稷山县西里村六十二个互助组一致向曲耀离互助组应战
    保证把全部新棉卖给国家
    曲耀离互助组全体同志们：我们看到你们提出的爱国售棉的挑战书后，热烈地作了讨论，全村六十二个互助组一致愿向你们应战。我们今年棉花丰收，每亩平均产量已达到抗战前的水平，部分且已超过战前水平。这完全是由于共产党毛主席领导我们组织起来、提高耕作技术，和工人老大哥的帮助所致。现在国家需要棉花，我们决心把全部新棉卖给国家，支援工业，建设祖国。我们的应战条件如下：（一）所摘新棉除留下必需用的絮棉外，全部卖给国家，保证质量达到干、净、白。（二）保证快摘、快晒、快拣、快轧、快卖，并做到集体（以村或组为单位）卖花，每五天向合作社送花一次，保证于十二月底全部摘完卖完。（三）为了给明年棉花丰产准备条件，我们保证普遍进行田间选种，做到棵选、粒选，保留斯字棉种，保证明年全部用斯字棉种。对以上应战条件，我们互助组不只自己保证作到，并要带领全村二十七个单干户同样作到。
    山西稷山县西里村六十二个互助组全体组员
