Factories and mines under the Northeast People's Government's Department of Industry
    Increase Production and Practice Economy, Creating Value Equivalent to More Than Five Million Tons of Grain
    The factories and mines under the Northeast People's Government's Department of Industry have now increased production and practiced economy, creating wealth equivalent to more than five million tons of grain. This figure accounts for half of the total value of the increase production and practice economy plan of all state-owned enterprises in Northeast China, and more than 60% of the increase production and practice economy plan of the Department of Industry.
    Among the increase production and practice economy campaigns, the achievements of state-owned enterprises in Shenyang are the most significant. Sixteen factories in the city have completed their increase production and practice economy tasks two months ahead of schedule with an average overfulfillment of more than 10%, creating wealth worth more than 750,000 tons of grain. Currently, these factories have re-formulated their increase production and practice economy plans.
    The large-scale increase production and practice economy campaign launched by the factories and mines under the Northeast Department of Industry began in August this year. In the campaign, the production outlook of all the factories and mines that truly relied on the working class and fully utilized the potential capabilities of the enterprises has been completely renewed. The most significant manifestations of this are: (1) The political awareness of the broad masses of workers and staff has been greatly enhanced. Because workers and staff in many factories and mines have recognized the great significance of this increase production and practice economy campaign for strengthening the country's national defense and economic strength, as well as for the future happiness of the working class, their enthusiasm and consciousness in participating in the campaign are higher than at any time in the past. For example, the workers and staff of the forging workshop of the Fushun Machinery Repair Factory said in their letter to Chairman Gao Gang: "Now, every time we strike with a hammer and every time we burn a piece of iron, we must think about being responsible to the country." A factory in Dalian had previously been afraid that the administrative side would raise production quotas in past labor competitions, so production enthusiasm could not be fully exerted; but after this campaign started, everyone automatically requested to revise various unreasonable quota standards and completed the production tasks every month. The content stipulated in the master-apprentice contracts of a machine factory could not be fully realized in the past because the old workers had a conservative technical mindset; after this campaign was launched, the old workers broke with their conservative technical ideas, and the new and old workers were united as never before. The apprentices said: "The technology learned in one month now is more than what was learned in the past year." Due to the unprecedented increase in the level of awareness of workers and staff, a high tide of rationalization proposals of "using brains," "finding tricks," and "tapping potential" appeared in many factories and mines after the campaign started, ensuring the smooth completion of the increase production and practice economy plan.
    (2) Leading cadres of the CCP enterprise committees, administrations, trade unions, and Communist Youth Leagues, as well as technical personnel and staff in various factories and mines, have all gone deep into the workshops in this campaign to study and solve key problems in production. This style of going deep into the masses and combining with reality is rarely seen in past labor competition campaigns. In this way, leading cadres have become more deeply familiar with the production process and the ideological situation of workers and staff, and have timely overcome and prevented complacency among workers and staff and bureaucratic styles among some leading personnel, and solved many important problems in production. For example, because the technical personnel and financial management personnel of the Shenyang Smelting Plant cooperated well with the workers, the plant put forward more than a thousand rationalization proposals in the third quarter; eleven new personal records appeared in August; and twelve new group records were created in September. Now, the plant has completed its increase production and practice economy task of 115,976 tons ahead of schedule by more than two months. In this campaign, the Chemical Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company also solved the problem of improving the quality of asphalt, which the factory had not been able to solve since the puppet Manchuria period.
    (3) With the deepening development of the increase production and practice economy campaign, the business management of enterprises has been further improved. Anshan Iron and Steel Company did not establish a system for the reserve and ordering of raw materials in the past, but these systems have been gradually established in this campaign. They also disposed of stagnant and excess reserves of materials worth 65 billion yuan, and improved the phenomenon that the material department's preparation of supply plans and ordering of raw materials was disconnected from the workshops in the past. The workers and staff of the machining workshop of Machine Factory No. 1 improved the unreasonable production organization in this campaign and created the "joint team" working method, which greatly improved labor productivity as a result.

### 东北人民政府工业部所属厂矿  增产节约价值已达五百多万吨粮食

　　东北人民政府工业部所属厂矿
    增产节约价值已达五百多万吨粮食
    东北人民政府工业部所属各厂矿，现已增产节约了价值等于五百多万吨粮食的财富。这一数字占全东北公营企业增产节约计划总值的一半，占工业部增产节约计划的百分之六十以上。
    在增产节约运动中，沈阳市国营企业的成绩最为显著。全市已有十六个工厂提前两个月并平均超额百分之十以上完成增产节约任务，共增产节约价值七十五万余吨粮食的财富。目前，这些工厂又新订了增产节约计划。
    东北工业部所属厂、矿大规模地开展增产节约运动，是从今年八月间开始的。在运动中，凡是真正依靠工人阶级，充分发挥了企业潜在能力的厂矿，生产面貌都焕然一新。这方面最显著的表现是：（一）广大职工政治觉悟大大提高。许多厂矿的职工因为认识了这次增产节约运动对于加强国家国防力量和经济力量以及对工人阶级未来幸福前途的重大意义，所以参加运动的积极性和自觉性都比任何时期要高。如抚顺机械修理厂锻造车间职工在给高岗主席的信中说：“现在每打一鎯头，每烧一块铁，都要想到对国家负责。”旅大某工厂在以往的劳动竞赛中曾怕行政方面提高生产定额，因而生产热情未能充分发挥；但在这次运动开始后，大家都自动要求修正各种不合理的定额标准，并且每月都完成了生产任务。某机器厂师徒合同中规定的内容，过去因老工人存在着技术保守观点，经常不能完全实现；这次运动开展后，老工人已打破技术保守观念，新老职工空前团结。徒工们说：“现在一个月所学到的技术，比过去一年还多。”由于职工觉悟程度空前提高，许多厂、矿在运动开始后就出现了一个“动脑筋”、“找窍门”、“挖潜力”的合理化建议的高潮，保证了增产节约计划的顺利完成。
    （二）各厂矿的中共企业党委、行政、工会、青年团的领导干部以及技术人员和职员，在这次运动中都普遍深入车间，研究和解决了生产中的关键问题。这种深入群众结合实际的作风，是过去历次劳动竞赛运动中所少见的。这样，就使得领导干部更加深入地熟悉了生产过程和职工思想情况，及时地克服和防止了职工中的自满情绪和某些领导人员中的官僚主义作风，解决了生产中的许多重要问题。如沈阳冶炼厂因为技术人员、财务管理人员与工人合作得好，在第三季度中全厂共提出了千余条合理化建议；八月份出现了十一项个人新纪录；九月份更创造了十二次全体新纪录。现在，全厂已提前两个多月完成了今年增产节约十一万五千九百七十六吨的任务。鞍山钢铁公司化工部在这次运动中，也解决了该厂从伪满以来一直没有办法改进的柏油质量问题。
    （三）随着增产节约运动的深入发展，更加提高了企业的经营管理工作。鞍山钢铁公司过去对于原材料的储备和订购，都没有建立制度，在这次运动中这些制度已逐步建立。他们还处理了价值六百五十亿元的呆滞和超额储备材料，改进了过去材料部门编制供应计划和订购原材料跟车间脱节的现象。机器一厂加工车间职工，在这次运动中改善了不合理的生产组织，创造了“联合小组”的工作方法，结果大大地提高了劳动生产率。　（新华社）
