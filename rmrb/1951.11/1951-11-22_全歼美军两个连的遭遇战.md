    Annihilation of Two U.S. Army Companies in an Encounter Battle
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Yan Wu

    On October 12th, two companies of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army engaged in an encounter battle with the enemy in the Shangpufang area west of Lianchuan, on the left bank of the Imjin River. Under conditions where neither side had artillery support, our army completely annihilated two companies, the Second and Third Companies, of the First Battalion of the Seventh Regiment of the U.S. Cavalry Division, totaling three hundred and eight men.

    On the night of the 11th, a company of our army was ordered to deploy defenses on the south mountain of Shangpufang. When the company arrived at its destination at dawn, the enemy had already occupied the hilltop. At this time, Platoon Leader Zhang Huawu led his entire platoon of comrades in a brave attack against the enemy, and immediately captured the hilltop position. The American soldiers guarding the hilltop, caught in this sudden attack, turned and fled. Subsequently, the American forces in the depth of the position hastily spread out in a fan formation and engaged in battle. Thus, an annihilation battle between forces of approximately equal strength began.

    From the beginning, the battle was a face-to-face charge and kill. The explosions and gunfire of hand grenades and submachine guns rang out in unison, and smoke and dust filled the entire hilltop. In the repeated struggle for control, after warrior Zhou Shoulin used his submachine gun to kill more than ten enemy soldiers in one go, his own bullets ran out. At this moment, an enemy soldier charged at him, and he bravely ran up and fought the enemy hand-to-hand. The brave warriors fought fiercely with the enemy for an entire day. Finally, another company of the enemy reinforced them; the brave warriors were ordered to retreat to another hillock, preparing to cooperate with brother units to annihilate this enemy force in the evening.

    At night, the brave warriors, carrying hand grenades with the covers removed and submachine guns loaded with bullets, charged up the mountain with irresistible courage. The soldiers of the assault team quietly crept up to the enemy sentry and suddenly blew a whistle; then the machine guns responsible for covering the assault swept towards the breakthrough from various firing positions. At this time, all the charging warriors, shouting battle slogans of killing the enemy and achieving meritorious service, fought and charged, all the way through. Soldiers Chen Tonghuang and Luo Kaiming, with one hand operating their submachine guns and the other throwing hand grenades at the fleeing enemy, fought all the way into the enemy's deep positions, eliminating the enemy huddled in the bunkers.

    Another assault team of warriors silently and swiftly inserted themselves into the enemy's formation. The first warrior, He Xianyan, was approaching the enemy when an enemy sentry on patrol happened to step on his hand. He silently allowed him to pass, and then shot him dead. The soldiers behind him then launched the charge. Feng Xiuyuan picked up his light machine gun and quickly broke into the enemy's communication trench, bringing up the follow-up troops. Then there was another fierce battle. One of our machine gunners was killed, and rifleman Zhang Zongsheng went up to replace him. He fired more than a dozen bursts of bullets, finally driving the last group of enemy soldiers who counterattacked back in a panic. Communist Party member Shi Chongji, after repelling four enemy counterattacks, suffered a severe injury to his right arm, but he did not tell anyone, enduring the pain and using his left hand to throw hand grenades, holding a breakthrough point.

    At dawn, three hundred and eight enemies from two companies of the U.S. Cavalry Division had been completely annihilated. Cheers erupted on the hilltop, and the brave warriors of the two companies of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army victoriously joined forces.

    全歼美军两个连的遭遇战
    新华社记者　阎吾
    志愿军某部两个连十月十二日在临津江左岸涟川以西上浦防地区与敌发生遭遇战，在双方都无炮火支援的条件下，我军全歼美军骑兵第一师第七团第一营的第二、三连两个连三百零八名。
    十一日夜，我军某连奉命到上浦防南山布防。该连在天明到达目的地时，敌人已经占领了这个山头。这时排长张化武带领全排战友奋勇地向敌发起攻击，一下就攻占了山头阵地。守在山头上的美国兵受到这突然的袭击，掉头就逃，接着在纵深的美军仓皇地撒开扇形队伍投入战斗。一场敌我兵力相均的歼灭战就此打响了。
    战斗一开始便是面对面的冲杀，手榴弹、冲锋枪的爆炸声和发射声响成一片，硝烟和尘土弥漫着整个山头。在反复争夺中，战士周寿林用冲锋枪一口气打死了十多个鬼子后，自己的子弹已经打光。这时，一个敌人冲过来了，他便奋勇地跑上去徒手和敌人搏斗。勇士们就这样英勇地同敌人激战了整整一天。最后敌人的另一个连又增援上来；勇士们奉命转移到另一座山包上，准备在晚间配合兄弟连队歼灭这股敌人。
    入夜，勇士们提着掀开盖的手榴弹，挟着装满子弹的冲锋枪，以锐不可当的勇气杀上山去。突击队的战士悄悄摸到敌人哨兵跟前，突然吹响了哨音；于是担任掩护冲锋的机枪便从各个火力阵地上向突破口扫射过去。这时所有冲锋的勇士们边打边冲，高呼着杀敌立功的战斗口号。战士陈通煌和罗开明两人一手扳动着冲锋枪，一手向逃敌扔手榴弹，一直打进敌人纵深阵地，消灭了蜷伏在地堡中的敌人。
    另一路突击队战士们肃静而敏捷地插入敌阵。第一名勇士何岘延爬近敌人时，一个巡逻的敌军哨兵正好一脚踏在他的手上。他一声不响的让他走过去，然后一枪将他打死。后面的战士就发起了冲锋。冯秀元抱起他的轻机枪迅速打进了敌人的交通壕，把后续部队接了上来。接着又是一场激烈的厮杀，我们的一个机枪射手牺牲了，步兵枪手张宗胜就上去代替。他一口气打出了十几梭子的子弹，终于将最后反扑过来的一群敌人打得狼狈逃窜。共产党员石重吉在打退敌人四次反扑后，右臂受了重伤，可是他没有告诉别人，忍着痛用左手扔手榴弹，守住了一个突破口。
    黎明时分，美军骑兵第一师两个连的三百零八名敌人已被全部歼灭。山顶阵地上欢声雷动，志愿军两个连的勇士们胜利地会师了。
