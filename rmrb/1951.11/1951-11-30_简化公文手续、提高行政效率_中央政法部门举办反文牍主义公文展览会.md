Xinhua News Agency, 29th: To promote the simplification of official documents and improve administrative efficiency, the Political and Legal Committee of the Central People's Government's State Council convened a secretarial work conference of central political and legal departments at the end of October. The meeting reviewed the handling of official documents in various departments and began an anti-red tape document exhibition on November 22nd. In the spirit of self-criticism and self-education, the exhibition displayed various types of documents exemplifying red tape, accompanied by concise, eye-catching, and educational explanations and charts.

Red tape is a manifestation of bureaucracy and a bad habit left over from the old yamen (feudal government offices). Although the various organs of the People's Government have avoided the old tones of "owing to" and "ordered accordingly" in form, various forms of red tape still widely exist. For example, a judicial organ once received a letter requesting clarification of adoption relationships. From receiving the document to replying, it went through a total of twenty-eight procedures, taking five months and three days. The exhibition created a journey map for this document, which at first glance looked like a city with many streets. Another department, when dealing with a draft sent by the People's Bank of China for comments, also took thirty-six days and went through thirty-six receipt and dispatch procedures because the document was circulating within the agency. As a result, twelve responsible individuals from eleven units (general office, bureau, division, section) (one director each from the general office and bureau, four division chiefs, and six section chiefs) wasted a lot of energy and time. A suggestion chart designed by the exhibition pointed out that if the competent unit convened relevant personnel for consultation and processing instead of simply transferring the document back and forth, it would be faster and more efficient.

The result of the development of red tape is "processing documents for the sake of processing documents." For example, formal documents were processed for sending a receipt or borrowing a telephone. Another example is that an agency issued a formal document, which actually only served as a receipt, and it also went through layers of verification and signing procedures. An agency received a document that was not within the scope of its business and copied the document and sent it to the competent authority with another formal document. The exhibition believes that this type of document only needs to be approved and forwarded on the original.

The exhibition listed many examples of irresponsibility, delays, and backlogs in handling documents. For example, someone wrote a letter asking about the political treatment of disabled revolutionary veterans and their families after their transfer to civilian work. The letter was backlogged for six months and five days because "the person in charge forgot." The exhibition also listed some examples of carelessness in processing documents, missing important instructions, and causing trouble.

In order to simplify documents and improve work efficiency, the "Simplified Document Convention" jointly signed by the central political and legal departments was also exhibited, providing a lot of help to visitors from various agencies. The convention has eight articles:

I. If a document can be sent or not sent, do not send it. Make full use of telephones, face-to-face consultations, and forwarding on the original document.
II. Strive for simplicity, speed, and neatness in documents, with simple and clear language. Advocate for informal letters and use official seals less.
III. Document signing and issuance should be the responsibility of internal levels, and relevant personnel should be informed.
IV. Establish a collective office system to handle important documents, avoiding level-by-level circulation and layer-by-layer signing and verification.
V. Documents should be classified as urgent or routine. Urgent matters should be handled urgently. If matters are to be handled slowly or cannot be handled, there should be an explanation.
VI. Strengthen inspections, conduct weekly summaries, and conclude matters monthly.
VII. Pay attention to confidentiality.
VIII. Save manpower and cherish paper. (Attached picture)

### 简化公文手续、提高行政效率  中央政法部门举办反文牍主义公文展览会

    简化公文手续、提高行政效率
    中央政法部门举办反文牍主义公文展览会
    【新华社二十九日讯】中央人民政府政务院政治法律委员会为号召简化公文，提高行政效率，在十月底召开了中央政法各部门秘书工作会议，检查了各部门公文处理的情况，并在十一月二十二日开始举办了一个反文牍主义公文的展览会。展览会以自我批评和自我教育的精神，陈列了各种类型的属于文牍主义的公文，并附有扼要醒目和富有教育意义的说明和图表。
    文牍主义是官僚主义的一种表现，是旧衙门遗留下来的坏风气。人民政府的各机关虽然在形式上避免了“等因”“奉此”的旧腔调，但仍普遍存在着各种各样的文牍主义。譬如，一个司法机关曾收到一件请求解答收养关系的信。从收文到复文，由于公文往来旅行，共经过二十八道手续，费时五个月零三天。展览会为这件公文制的旅程图，乍看起来很像一座包括不少街道的城市。另一个部门在处理人民银行送请提意见的一件草案时，也因为公文在机关内兜圈子，结果费时三十六天，经过了三十六次收发手续，以致十一个单位（办公厅、局、处、科）的十二个负责人（办公厅主任和局长各一人、处长四人、科长六人）浪费了很多精力和时间。展览会设计的一幅建议图指出：这件事如果由主管单位约集各有关人员协商处理，而不单纯地把公文转来转去，就迅速而省事了。
    文牍主义发展的结果，便成为“为办公文而办公文”。如送一纸收据或借用电话机，都办了正式公文。又如一个机关发出一件正式公文、实际只有收据作用，也经过了层层核签的手续。这个机关收到一件不是本单位业务范围内的公文，竟把这件公文重抄一份并另备正式公文一起送到主管机关去。展览会认为这类公文的处理，只须就原件批转便可以了。
    展览会列举了许多在处理公文中对人民不负责任的拖延积压的例子。比如有人写信问革命残废军人转业后，本人和他的家属的政治待遇问题。这封信被积压了六个月零五天，原因是“承办人忘记了”。展览会还列举了一些在办公文时粗枝大叶，漏了重要交代，以致招来麻烦的例子。
    为了简化公文，提高工作效率，中央政法各部门把最近联合签订的“简化公文公约”也展览出来，给予各机关参观者很多帮助。公约共有八条：
    一、可行文可不行文者，不行文。充分利用电话、面商及就原件批送等办法处理。
    二、行文力求简便、迅速、整齐，文字简单明了，提倡便函，少用大印。
    三、公文签发，内部分级负责，告知相关人员。
    四、建立集体办公制度，处理重要公文，避免逐级周转，层层签核。
    五、公文分别缓急，急事急办，缓办或不能办者，应有交代。
    六、加强检查，每周小结，每月结办。
    七、注意保密。
    八、节省人力，爱惜纸张。（附图片）
