A Brief International Commentary

    The North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting, under the pressure of the United States, began on the 24th of this month in Rome, the capital of Italy.

    After boasting about "peace" and "disarmament proposals" at the United Nations General Assembly in Paris, the representatives of the United States and its Western European puppet states, such as Britain and France, hurriedly ran to Rome to participate in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting to discuss expanding armaments and preparing for war. From this, people can see how hypocritical the warmongers of the United States, Britain, France, and other countries participating in the North Atlantic aggressive bloc are, and how false and worthless their so-called disarmament proposals at the United Nations General Assembly are! From this, people can see even more clearly that their so-called disarmament proposals are merely to cover up their plans for expanding armaments and preparing for war.

    In the past year, U.S. imperialism's forced expansion of armaments and war preparations in Western European countries has plunged it and its puppet states into inextricable economic and political crises. As a result of the passage of huge military budgets and the large-scale expansion of armies and military production, the financial and economic situation of these countries is deteriorating alarmingly. The U.S. fiscal deficit for this year will reach $8.5 billion, and Britain's deficit in foreign payments in the last six months has reached £700 million annually. This situation has led to a continuous decline in the living standards of the working people. In the United States, the cost of living has risen by at least 14 percent in the year since the start of the Korean War; in France, the cost of living has risen by 17 percent in the first half of this year alone; and Britain, due to low coal reserves and poor food supplies, faces a cold and hungry winter. The deterioration of the living conditions of the people in the United States and Western European countries has triggered a widespread surge in strike movements, peace movements, and struggles against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Therefore, what lies before the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting is not a beautiful sight, but heavy difficulties.

    The United States is not only trying to force its puppet states to further expand armaments and prepare for war at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting, but is also coercing Middle Eastern countries to participate in the so-called "Middle East Command." As Vyshinsky said in his proposal to the United Nations General Assembly on the 8th of this month: "Participation in the aggressive North Atlantic group is incompatible with the status of a member of the United Nations." Peace-loving people around the world are stepping up the movement to demand that the five major powers conclude a peace pact to stop the new war preparations of the United States and other countries belonging to the North Atlantic aggressive bloc.

    With so many difficulties and such a bleak outlook facing the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, the Rome Convention Council meeting cannot bring any magic tricks or a bright future to the aggressive bloc. On the contrary, its various agenda items for expanding armaments and preparing for war will further expose the aggressive nature of this bloc to the people of the world, and will be met with more intense opposition from the people of various countries, further increasing their difficulties in expanding armaments and preparing for war.

### 困难重重的罗马会议

    困难重重的罗马会议
    北大西洋公约理事会会议，已在美国的压力下，于本月二十四日在意大利首都罗马开始举行了。
    美国和它的西欧仆从国家英、法等国的代表们，在巴黎联合国大会上吹嘘过“和平”和“裁军建议”之后，现在又匆匆地跑到罗马去参加讨论扩军备战的北大西洋公约理事会会议。人们可以从这里看出：参加北大西洋侵略集团的美英法等国的战争贩子们是如何的口是心非，他们在联合国大会上所提出的所谓裁军的建议是何等的虚伪和一钱不值！从这里人们更可以看清，他们的所谓裁军建议，只是为了掩饰其扩军备战的计划。
    在过去一年中，美帝国主义逼迫西欧各国大规模地扩军备战，已使它和各仆从国家陷入了无法解脱的经济和政治的危机中。由于通过了庞大的军事预算和大规模扩充军队及军事生产的结果，这些国家的财政和经济情况正在惊人地日益恶化。美国本年度的财政赤字将达八十五亿美元，英国在最近半年中的对外支付赤字也已达到每年七亿英镑的数额。这种情况造成了劳动人民生活水平的不断下降。在美国，生活费用在朝鲜战争开始后一年来至少上涨了百分之十四；在法国，仅在今年上半年生活费用就上涨了百分之十七；英国由于煤炭储存量甚少与粮食供应情况恶劣，已使英国人民面临一个寒冷和饥饿的冬天。美国和西欧各国人民生活情况的恶化，已引起罢工运动、和平运动与反对北大西洋公约的斗争的普遍高涨。因此，摆在北大西洋公约理事会会议面前的，并不是什么美妙的景象，而是重重的困难。
    美国不仅企图在北大西洋公约理事会会议上迫使它的仆从国家进一步扩军备战，而且正在胁迫中东国家参加所谓“中东司令部”。正如维辛斯基本月八日在联合国大会上提出的建议中所说的：“参加侵略性的北大西洋集团是和联合国会员国的资格不相容的”。全世界爱好和平的人民正在加紧推进要求五大国缔结和平公约运动，来制止美国和其他属于北大西洋侵略集团的国家的新战争的准备。
    摆在北大西洋侵略集团面前的困难如此之多，景象如此阴暗，罗马的公约理事会议是不可能为侵略集团带来什么锦囊妙计和美妙前程的。相反的，它的各项扩军备战的议程，必将进一步在世界人民面前暴露出这个集团的侵略性质，而遭受到各国人民更为激烈的反对，使它们扩军备战的困难更为增加。
