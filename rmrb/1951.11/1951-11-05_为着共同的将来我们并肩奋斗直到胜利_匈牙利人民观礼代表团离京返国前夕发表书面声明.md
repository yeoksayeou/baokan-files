Xinhua News Agency, November 1st: The Hungarian People's Observation Delegation issued the following written statement on the eve of its departure from Beijing:

    We have stayed in China for thirty-three days. At the invitation of various people's organizations of the People's Republic of China, we were able to participate in the second National Day of the People's Republic of China, get to know the great Chinese people, and see the enormous leap-forward development of China, which are the characteristics of this revived country under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party. Our joy is beyond words.
    Our first word is to express our gratitude. Comrades and brothers, we deeply thank you for the unforgettable things we have experienced in your beautiful country. We thank you for your concern for us, thank you for the thoughtful arrangements for our trip, and the love we encountered everywhere. We will never forget those beautiful days when we visited Chinese cultural monuments in Beijing. We also saw huge construction projects, where brilliant prospects unfolded before our eyes. We have been to Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing, and Tianjin, and everywhere we see strength, optimism, and love for peace. We visited factories. Here, the great Chinese working class is working for the prosperity of the motherland. We met model workers who have achieved brilliant achievements in improving production. We have talked to ordinary workers who have sworn to dedicate themselves to the cause of peace in their patriotic covenants, and they have told us about the major changes in their lives. We met volunteer soldiers who were marching to the front singing songs, and they assured us that they would resolutely fight the aggressors to the final victory. We have been to very small villages, where the farmers told us about the changes in their lives since the land reform, and they spoke of Mao Zedong with gratitude. One village, when we arrived, had just caught up with celebrating the completion of the land reform and solemnly burning the old contracts. This was an indescribably joyful celebration, with people rejoicing and gongs and drums resounding everywhere, which showed their great joy. It is impossible to list all the large and small experiences that constitute the most beautiful part of our life. What moved us most was the love, joy, and enthusiasm we encountered everywhere. We know that the Chinese people have suffered a lot from foreigners, so we are glad that they can see the difference between us from people's democratic countries and those foreigners. In recent days, we have visited Tianjin by bus. A pedicab driver walking alongside us smiled and gave us a thumbs up, so we knew he was welcoming us. How did he know who we were? We can give many examples like this.
    This wonderful trip is simply a source of strength for us. We will bring this conviction, trust, determination, and strength back to our country and tell our people, making them stronger, so that they know, respect, and love the Chinese people we have come to admire. Now that parting is imminent, we cannot help but feel melancholy.
    However, we will never be separated. From now on, our eyes will be looking more at your country. Our goals, plans, difficulties, and struggles are common. Our future is also common: a humane, peaceful, and socialist world, for which we are fighting together until final victory!
    We wish the great Chinese people many victories!

    为着共同的将来我们并肩奋斗直到胜利
    匈牙利人民观礼代表团离京返国前夕发表书面声明
    【新华社一日讯】匈牙利人民观礼代表团在离京返国前夕发表书面声明如下：
    我们在中国逗留了三十三天。由于中华人民共和国各人民团体的邀请，我们得以参加了中华人民共和国的第二届国庆节，认识了伟大的中国人民，看到了中国的巨大的飞跃的发展，这些就是在毛泽东同志与中国共产党领导下的这个复兴了的国家的特点。我们的愉快，是言语不能表达的。
    我们的第一句话就是要表示感谢。同志们和兄弟们，为着我们在你们的美丽的祖国所经历的那些难以遗忘的事情，我们深深地感谢你们。我们谢谢你们对我们的关心，谢谢你们为我们的旅行所作的周到的安排以及我们到处所遇到的热爱。我们永远不能忘记我们在北京参观中国文化古迹时那些美丽的日子。我们也看到了巨大的建筑工程，在这里，我们眼前展开了光辉灿烂的远景。我们到过上海、杭州、南京、天津，到处所看到的都是力量、乐观与对和平的热爱。我们参观过工厂。在这里，伟大的中国工人阶级在为祖国的繁荣而劳动着。我们会见了在提高生产方面获得光辉成就的模范工人。我们曾与普通的工人谈话，他们在他们的爱国公约中宣誓致力于和平事业，他们告诉了我们他们生活上的重大变化。我们会晤了志愿军战士，他们高唱着歌子奔赴前方，并向我们保证坚决与侵略者战斗到最后胜利。我们曾到过很小的村庄，在那里，农民告诉我们自从土地改革后他们的生活所起的变化，他们并满怀感谢地谈着毛泽东。有一个村庄，在我们到达的时候，刚好赶上庆祝土地改革完成并庄严地焚毁旧契约的大会。这是一个难以描述的愉快的庆典，人们都欢欣若狂，到处锣鼓喧天，这说明了他们的巨大愉快。要列举那些构成我们一生中最美丽的一部分的大大小小的经历是不可能的。最使我们感动的是我们到处所遇到的那种热爱、喜悦和热情。我们知道，中国人民曾经受过外国人的许多苦头，因此，我们感到高兴，即他们能看到来自人民民主国家的我们和那些外国人之间的不同。最近几天，我们曾乘公共汽车在天津参观。一个和我们并排行走的三轮车夫笑着向我们翘起了大拇指，这样，我们就知道他是在向我们表示欢迎。他怎么知道我们是谁呢？这样的例子，我们可以举出很多。
    这一次美好的旅行简直是我们的一个力量的源泉。我们将把这种确信、信赖、决心与力量带回国去，把这告诉我国人民，使他们变得更坚强，使他们知道、尊敬并热爱我们已经对之发生了敬爱的中国人民。现在别离在即，我们不禁感觉怅然。
    但是，我们是永远都不分开的。从今以后，我们的眼睛将更多望着你们的国家。我们的目标、计划、困难与斗争都是共同的。我们的将来也是共同的：一个合乎人性的和平与社会主义的世界，为了这个将来，我们正在共同奋斗着，直到取得最后胜利！
    谨祝伟大的中国人民取得很多胜利！
