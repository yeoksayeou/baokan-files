    The bankruptcy of American rumors
    The shameless rumor fabricated by Hanley, the head of the Military Law Department of the Eighth Army of the American invading army, about the "killing of prisoners" by the Chinese and Korean People's forces has been completely bankrupted in the face of the ironclad facts of the lenient treatment of prisoners by the Chinese and Korean People's forces.

    The letters between American and British prisoners of war and their families, and the recorded broadcasts of American and British prisoners of war to their relatives in their home countries, describing the humane treatment received by the prisoners and their real living conditions, are ironclad proof of the Chinese and Korean People's forces' implementation of the revolutionary humanitarian policy towards prisoners of war. The fact that the Chinese and Korean People's forces treated prisoners leniently in accordance with this correct policy made American and British prisoners feel "surprised," led them to conclude that "the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army do not regard prisoners as enemies," and thereby made them realize that the war being waged by the United States and Britain "in Korea is an unjust war"; for the families of American and British prisoners, it made them realize the fact and truth that "the Chinese people are forever friends of the American (and British and other countries') people." Precisely because of this, the despicable lies fabricated by the American liars about the "killing of prisoners" by the Chinese and Korean People's forces appear particularly absurd and unfounded in the eyes of American and British prisoners and their families, and the people of the world, and the American and British people.

    Facts are the most eloquent and cannot be shaken or changed in the slightest by any rumors. The American and British prisoners apparently expected that the heads of the invading army would definitely spread rumors, so they told their families: "...You must have heard that the Korean People's Army and the Chinese Volunteers are going to kill the prisoners. Don't believe these words..."

    This is the testimony of the American and British prisoners themselves, and it is the most powerful answer to the absurd rumor of the "killing of prisoners" by the Chinese and Korean People's forces. What evidence can the shameless American liar Hanley, and the American officials and generals who instructed him to fabricate the rumors behind him, present to refute this ironclad fact? Obviously, they cannot find and cannot possibly find any factual basis.

    This makes it easy to understand why the American generals in Washington and the Ridgway headquarters in Tokyo, as well as Hanley, behaved so flustered and contradictory in the face of the rumors they fabricated themselves. Hanley himself once said that his rumors were "published with the approval of senior officials," and then said that they were published "not on the instructions of anyone." The head of the U.S. Department of Defense's press office, Fritchie, publicly admitted that "there is no information yet that can confirm this statement (referring to Hanley's rumors)"; Hanley himself had to admit that his "evidence" "may have unreliable sources."

    The rumors fabricated by the American liars have been quickly and thoroughly bankrupted because they have been exposed by ironclad facts. They cannot achieve the ulterior motives they expect from this despicable trick; on the contrary, they have once again exposed their shameful plots and despicable and dirty faces in the face of peace-loving people all over the world. This will inevitably make the people of the world despise and hate these liars even more!

### 美国谣言的破产

    美国谣言的破产
    美国侵略军第八军军法处处长汉莱所捏造的中朝人民部队“杀害俘虏”的无耻谣言，在中朝人民部队宽待俘虏的铁的事实的面前，已经彻底破产了。
    美英俘虏与其家属互相往来的书信和美英俘虏对其国内亲人的录音广播中，所描述的俘虏们受到的人道待遇和他们的生活实况，便是中朝人民部队执行革命人道主义俘虏政策的铁证。中朝人民部队根据这种正确的俘虏政策而宽待俘虏的事实，使美英俘虏们感到“惊奇”，使他们得出了“中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军不把俘虏看成敌人”的结论，并从而使他们认识了美英“在朝鲜进行的战争是一场不正义的战争”；对于美英俘虏的家属，则使他们认识了“中国人民永远是美国（和英国以及其他国家）人民的朋友”这一事实和真理。正因为如此，美国骗子们所捏造的中朝人民部队“杀害俘虏”的卑鄙谰言，在美英俘虏及其家属和世界人民、美英人民的面前就显得格外的荒诞无稽。
    事实是最雄辩的，是任何谣言所不能使其动摇和丝毫有所改变的。美英俘虏们显然是早已料到侵略军的头目必定会造谣的，因此他们才会告诉他们的家属：“……你一定听到朝鲜人民军与中国志愿军要把俘虏杀掉。不要相信这些话……”。
    这就是美英俘虏自己的证言，也就是对中朝人民部队“杀害俘虏”的荒谬谣言的最有力的答复。无耻的美国骗子汉莱以及在他的背后指使他捏造谣言的美国的官员和将军们，能提出什么样的证据来驳倒这种铁的事实呢？显然他们是找不到也不可能找到任何事实根据的。
    这就不难使人了解，华盛顿的美国将军们和东京的李奇微总部以及汉莱为什么会在他们自己所捏造的谣言面前表现得那样慌乱和矛盾百出。汉莱自己就曾一会儿说他的谣言是“奉到高级官员的批准方发表”的，一会儿又说“并不是奉任何人的训令”而发表的。美国国防部的新闻处长佛利契就曾公开供认“还没有得到什么情报，可以证实此说（指汉莱的谣言）”；汉莱自己也不得不承认，他的“证据”“来源可能是不可靠的”。
    美国骗子们所制造的谣言，因为被铁的事实所揭破而迅速彻底地破产了。他们不可能从他们这一卑鄙伎俩中达到他们所期待的不可告人的目的，相反的是在全世界爱好和平人民的面前再度暴露了他们的可耻的图谋和卑鄙龌龊的面目。这就必然要使得全世界的人民更加卑视和憎恶这些骗子们！
