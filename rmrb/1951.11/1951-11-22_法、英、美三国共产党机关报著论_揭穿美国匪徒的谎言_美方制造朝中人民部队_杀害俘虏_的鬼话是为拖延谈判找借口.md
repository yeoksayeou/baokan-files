Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 21st. Communist Party newspapers in France, England, and the United States, namely "L'Humanité" in Paris, "The Daily Worker" in London, and "The Daily Worker" in New York, have successively published commentaries denouncing the American aggressors for fabricating the lie about the so-called "killing of prisoners" by the Korean and Chinese People's Armies.

    "L'Humanité" in Paris published a commentary on the 17th, stating: "Just when the American people and the American soldiers fighting in Korea could no longer tolerate the unreasonable attitude of the American representatives at the Panmunjom conference, the lies about atrocities emerged. The higher-ups fabricated lies about American soldiers suffering 'atrocities' in the hope of continuing to delay the negotiations and to find an excuse for the unreasonable attitude consistently adopted by the American representatives so far." "L'Humanité" pointed out: "There have been many atrocities in Korea, and the US military command is the sole perpetrator of these atrocities. The International Democratic Women's Federation investigation team has reported hundreds of examples of atrocities committed by the US and Rhee forces. These examples are all well-documented."

    The London "Daily Worker" published an editorial on the 17th entitled "The Lies of the Atomic Bandits," stating: "Nothing has ever demonstrated the danger of the American political bandits more clearly than the lie of 'massacring prisoners.'" The newspaper said: "To get votes, American politicians will tell any lie and do any evil." "Next year is an election year in the United States, and politicians are beginning to clamor that the Koreans and Chinese should be taught a lesson. ...Therefore, they have used every means that a conscienceless person can think of to obstruct a ceasefire agreement." The newspaper concluded by calling on the British people to join the movement demanding an end to the Korean War.

    The New York "Daily Worker" pointed out on the 18th that the lie of "massacring prisoners of war" has sinister purposes. The newspaper said: "The International Democratic Women's Federation has submitted a shocking report to the United Nations detailing the atrocities committed by the US and Rhee forces. Before Acheson accuses others of 'barbarism,' he should agree to a public hearing of this report and investigate the atrocities mentioned in the report."

    法、英、美三国共产党机关报著论
    揭穿美国匪徒的谎言
    美方制造朝中人民部队“杀害俘虏”的鬼话是为拖延谈判找借口 【新华社布拉格二十一日电】法国巴黎“人道报”、英国伦敦“工人日报”、美国纽约“工人日报”先后发表评论，斥责美国侵略者制造所谓朝中人民军队“杀害俘虏”的谎话。
    巴黎“人道报”在十七日发表评论说：“正当美国人民和在朝鲜作战的美国士兵再也不能容忍美国代表在板门店会议上采取的无理态度的时候，出现了关于暴行的谎话。高级方面制造美国士兵遭受‘暴行’的谎话，是希望借此继续拖延谈判，并为美方代表到现在为止一贯采取的无理态度找借口。”“人道报”指出：“在朝鲜是有过很多暴行的，美军司令部正是这些暴行的唯一制造者。国际民主妇女联合会调查团已报道了美、李军暴行的好几百个例子。这些例子都是证据确凿的。”
    伦敦“工人日报”十七日以“原子匪徒的谎话”为题，发表社论说：“从来没有任何东西比‘屠杀俘虏’的谎话能够更清楚地表现出美国政治匪徒的危险了。”该报说：“为了得到选票，美国政客们什么谎话都说得出，什么坏事都做得出。”“明年是美国的选举年，政客们开始大事叫嚣说：应当给朝鲜人和中国人一个教训。……因此，他们运用了昧良心的人所能想起的每一种手段来阻挠停战协议。”该报最后号召英国人民起来参加要求结束朝鲜战争的运动。
    纽约“工人日报”在十八日指出：“屠杀战俘”的谎话有着阴险的目的。该报说：“国际民主妇女联合会已向联合国提出了关于美、李军暴行详情的骇人听闻的报告。艾奇逊在指责别人‘野蛮’以前，应当赞成公开听取这个报告，并调查报告中所说的暴行。”
