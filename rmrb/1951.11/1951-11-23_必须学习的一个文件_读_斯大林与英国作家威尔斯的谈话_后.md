    A Must-Read Document
    ——After Reading “Stalin’s Conversation with British Writer H.G. Wells”
    To the Editor: After reading “Stalin’s Conversation with British Writer H.G. Wells” (see page three of the November 14th issue of this newspaper), I thought that at present, the vast majority of intellectuals in our country have recognized the consistency of their interests with those of the working class and are willing to serve the construction of the new China, and many have made outstanding achievements. However, there are still some people who have, to varying degrees, some erroneous ideas.
    Among the people we encounter daily, we can often see: some intellectuals only one-sidedly estimate their good aspects, giving themselves supreme evaluations. In their hearts, they privately believe that the revolution is led by "intellectuals"; that social evolution can be promoted by the wishes of certain intellectuals - "great outstanding figures"; as for construction work, that is even more "the business of intellectuals." These people are always arrogant, look down on the masses, and therefore cannot rely on the masses in their work. For example, from the errors in capital construction continuously exposed by the People's Daily, we can see how much loss people with this kind of thinking have caused to the country! If such people are teachers, they encourage students to simply study "knowledge", not to ask about politics, and to spread decadent individualism, completely violating the principles of New Democratic education.
    Some people deny the necessity of revolution, mistakenly confusing revolution with reactionary reformism. Not long ago, many people glorified the reactionary Wu Xun, using this to promote "education to save the country," thus obscuring the broad masses' understanding of revolution and class struggle. Similarly, when land reform began last year in East China, Central South and other places, many "intellectuals" produced the idea of ​​"peaceful land reform" and became the echo of the landlord class. They mistakenly believed that the reactionary ruling class of history would automatically give way. However, the facts finally criticized this idea as wrong.
    Therefore, as various ideological remolding movements for intellectuals are unfolding today, I suggest that the vast number of intellectuals earnestly study this document, criticize and eliminate their remaining erroneous thoughts, so that they can better serve the construction of the motherland.

    必须学习的一个文件
    ——读“斯大林与英国作家威尔斯的谈话”后
    编辑同志：读了“斯大林与英国作家威尔斯的谈话”（见十一月十四日本报三版）后，我想到在目前，我国的绝大多数知识分子都已认识到自己和工人阶级利益的一致性，愿意为新中国的建设事业而服务，并有不少人做出了优异的成绩。但是，也还有一部分人或多或少地存在着一些错误的思想。
    在我们日常接触的人当中，就常常可以看到：某些知识分子只片面地估计自己好的方面，给自己以至高无上的评价。他们心里私下认为革命是“知识分子”领导的；社会的进化是可以凭着某些知识分子——“伟大的优秀的人物”的愿望来推动的；至于建设工作，那更是“知识分子的事”了。这些人总是自高自大，看不起群众，因而在工作中就不可能依靠群众。譬如，从人民日报连续揭发的基本建设中的错误，我们就可以看到，有着这种思想的人，给了国家以多大的损失！这种人在作教师，他们就鼓励学生单纯地学习“知识”，不问政治，传播腐朽的个人主义思想，完全违反了新民主主义教育的原则。
    某些人否认革命的必要，他们错误地把革命与反动的改良主义混淆起来。像不久以前，就有不少人美化了反动的武训，借以宣传“教育救国”，而模糊了广大人民对革命、对阶级斗争的认识。又如去年华东、中南等地开始土地改革时，也有不少“知识分子”产生了“和平土改”思想，做了地主阶级的应声虫。他们错误地认为历史的反动统治阶级是会自动地让位的。但是，事实终于批判了这种思想是错误的。
    因此，当各种知识分子思想改造运动正在展开的今天，我建议广大的知识分子都认真地学习这一文件，批判并清除自己残存的错误思想，使自己能更好地为祖国的建设事业而服务。
