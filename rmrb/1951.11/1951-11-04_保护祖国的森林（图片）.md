    Protecting the Forests of the Motherland
    Liu Jiyou
    (14) Although Wang Qingheng is not in the fire prevention season, he is always concerned about the forest work. For example, when the county farm arbitrarily pulled timber in the forest area, he immediately reported it to the government for prohibition.
    (15) Wang Qingheng's conscientious and responsible spirit has also had a great impact on forest rangers throughout the county. At a county-wide forest ranger meeting, he issued a challenge to everyone:
    1. Guarantee that there will be no fire in his fire prevention area;
    2. If a fire breaks out in a neighboring area, he guarantees to lead a team to fight the fire and do a good job in joint fire prevention work.
    All the forest rangers actively responded to the challenge and expressed that they would learn from Wang Qingheng's responsible spirit and work hard to protect the forests of the motherland. (The End)

    保护祖国的森林

    （十四）王清恒虽然不在防火季节也时刻关心着山林工作。例如县农场随便在林区拉木材，被他看见了就马上报告政府加以制止。
    （十五）王清恒认真负责的精神，对全县护林员也发生了很大影响。在一次全县护林员会议上，他向大家提出挑战条件：
    一、保证他的防火区不起一次火灾；
    二、如果邻区起火，他保证带队前往扑救，做好联合防火工作。
    全体护林员都积极应战，并表示要学习王清恒的负责精神，为保护祖国森林而努力。（完）
