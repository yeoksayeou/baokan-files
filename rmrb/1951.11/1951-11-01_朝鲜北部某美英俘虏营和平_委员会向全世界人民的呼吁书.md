[Report from this newspaper] The American invading army bombed the location of a prisoner of war camp in a certain area of ​​northern Korea on the night of October 13th, killing and wounding 21 local residents and American and British prisoners of war. 1,362 American and British prisoners of war in the prisoner of war camp issued a joint appeal to the people of the world through their peace committee, demanding that the recurrence of such crimes by the American military be stopped immediately. The following is the full text of their appeal. To the American people, the British people, and the democratic newspapers of the world:

    We are the responsible personnel of the Peace Committee elected by American and British prisoners of war in prisoner of war camps in North Korea. On behalf of 1,362 American and British prisoners of war, we issue this appeal to the people of all countries in the world for peace and justice.

    We want to protest the crimes committed by American aircraft: At 10:00 p.m. on Saturday, October 13, 1951, an American aircraft circled over the location of our prisoner of war camp, and then dropped 60 fragmentation bombs and at least one high-explosive bomb. This shameful act of violence by the American aircraft caused considerable death, injury, and great destruction. According to our subsequent investigation, there were a total of 5 deaths and 16 injuries, two of whom died from their injuries, and one is in critical condition. The casualties are as follows: 8 American and British prisoners of war were injured (one of whom died from his injuries). One cook from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army died and two were injured (one of whom died from his injuries). Four Korean residents died and four were injured. Two overseas Chinese living in Korea were injured.

    The list of injured American and British prisoners of war is as follows: Air Force Second Lieutenant Robert German (Military ID AO-925833), from New Jersey, USA (died from his injuries). Captain Joseph Eligo (Military ID AO-1040377), from Washington State, USA. Major E.D. Harding, from Shropshire, England. Second Lieutenant C.T. Costello, from Mopshire, England. Sergeant Major F.G. Strong, from Essex, England. Corporal Marian Von Hauser (Military ID RA-17204045), from Iowa, USA. Private First Class Robert Pace (Military ID RA-13365416), from Pennsylvania, USA. Private First Class Charles Dick (Military ID RA-15379078), from Kentucky, USA.

    Due to the American aircraft bombing, the property losses in the prisoner of war camp and the residential area where it was located are as follows: Eight houses were partially damaged, and another one was completely destroyed.

    We want to point out that this city is in a safe area of North Korea, and like many other areas with prisoner of war camps, it has absolutely no military targets. Apart from the personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who manage the prisoners of war and the residents of the city, there are only us prisoners of war. This city has no factories and no railways. The supplies for this city are all for us prisoners of war or residents.

    This shameful indiscriminate bombing of the prisoner of war camp by American aircraft is by no means an isolated incident. We know that many prisoner of war camps have been bombed and strafed by American aircraft more than once. We have also witnessed American aircraft wantonly bombing and strafing the people of peaceful cities and towns in Korea many times. Many towns and villages were bombed, and innocent people, including many children, died as a result. On the way from near the 38th parallel where we were captured to here in the rear of North Korea, we witnessed these tragic scenes with our own eyes.

    Since we were captured, we have been treated favorably by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. After arriving at this prisoner of war camp, we received many daily necessities, including clean clothes and washing utensils. We have enough food, the same as what the Chinese People's Volunteer Army gets. We are in good health and can receive medical care in our own hospital. The local Korean people provide us with warm housing. We are all safe and healthy, wholeheartedly waiting for the day when we can return home and reunite with our families. In fact, our only danger is that we will be bombed again by American aircraft, thus depriving us of the opportunity to live to return to our country as free men. We hope that the people of the world will pay attention to our current situation. What we are worried about is not the suffering of being prisoners of war in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, but that the selfish warmongers who sent us here will come and bomb us to death again.

    We now appeal to all peace-loving people of the world to unite, for humanity and justice, and to ensure the lives and safety of thousands of prisoners of war, as well as the lives and safety of tens of thousands of innocent Korean men, women, and children. Send strong protests to the governments concerned, demanding an immediate stop to this shameful act of violence.

    People who read our letter will understand what war and indiscriminate bombing mean. We especially appeal to the people of Rotterdam, Coventry, London, Warsaw, and other places in the world that suffered barbaric bombings in World War II. Ask you to support us.

    This "war," which some call a "police action," is, in our view, a completely unjust war that should not have been initiated by the American and British reactionary groups; but now, all peace-loving people in the world must step up the struggle to stop this conflict and establish a genuine and lasting peace as soon as possible.

    We wholeheartedly sign this appeal and hope that the democratic newspapers of the world will publish it.

### 朝鲜北部某美英俘虏营和平  委员会向全世界人民的呼吁书

    朝鲜北部某美英俘虏营和平
    委员会向全世界人民的呼吁书
    【本报讯】美国侵略军飞机于十月十三日夜间轰炸朝鲜北部某地某俘虏营驻地，炸死炸伤当地居民及美英俘虏二十一名。该俘虏营一千三百六十二名美英俘虏通过他们的和平委员会联名向全世界人民发出呼吁，要求立即制止美军这种罪行的重演。下面是他们的呼吁书的全文。美国人民、英国人民和全世界民主报刊：
    我们是在北朝鲜俘虏营中美英俘虏们所选出的和平委员会负责人员，我们代表一千三百六十二名美、英俘虏，为了和平与正义，向全世界各国人民发出这份呼吁书。
    我们要抗议美国飞机制造的罪行：一九五一年十月十三日（星期六）下午十点的时候，一架美国飞机在我们俘虏营所在地的上空飞旋，后来即投下六十个杀伤炸弹，和至少一个有高度爆炸力的炸弹。美国飞机这一可耻的暴行造成了相当的死伤和很大的破坏。根据我们事后调查，计死亡五人，负伤十六人，其中两人已因伤致死，一人在垂危中。死伤的情况如下：美英俘虏受伤者八人（其中一人已因伤致死）。中国人民志愿军炊事员一人死亡，两人受伤（其中一人已因伤致死）。朝鲜居民四人死亡，四人受伤。旅居朝鲜的华侨两人受伤。
    美、英俘虏受伤名单如下：空军少尉罗贝特·格曼（军号AO——925833），美国新泽西州人（因伤致死）。上尉约瑟夫·艾里哥（军号AO——1040377），美国华盛顿州人。少校依·迪·哈丁，英国塞罗普厦人。少尉西·提·科斯特罗，英国漠普夏人。军曹长福·吉·史特朗，英国艾塞斯人。伍长马利安·冯豪塞（军号RA——17204045），美国依阿华州人。上等兵罗贝特·佩斯（军号RA——13365416），美国宾夕法尼亚州人。上等兵查理斯·狄克（军号RA—15379078），美国肯达基州人。
    由于美机轰炸，俘虏营和所在地居民区财产的损失如下：八幢房屋部分损坏，另外一幢全部被炸毁。
    我们要指出，这个城市是在北朝鲜的安全区域，它和其他许多有俘虏营的地区一样，绝未有任何军事目标。除了中国人民志愿军管理俘虏的人员和城市居民以外，就只有我们俘虏们。这个城市既没有工厂，也没有铁路。这个城市的供应也均为我们俘虏或居民而设。
    这次美机对俘虏营的可耻的不加区别的轰炸，决不是孤立的事件。我们知道，许多俘虏营曾不止一次地遭到美机的轰炸和扫射。我们也曾多次目睹美机对朝鲜和平城乡的人民滥肆轰炸和扫射。许许多多城镇乡村被炸毁，无辜的人民，包括许多儿童在内，因而死亡。我们从我们被俘的三八线附近走到北朝鲜后方的这里，一路上，我们亲眼看到了这些惨不忍睹的现象。
    自我们被俘迄今，我们受到中国人民志愿军的优待。到这个俘虏营以后，我们得到了许多生活上日用必需品，包括干净的衣服和洗刷用具。我们有足够的食物，和中国人民志愿军所得到的一样。我们健康情况良好，且可在我们自己的医院中得到医药照顾。朝鲜当地人民则供给我们以温暖的房舍。我们每人都平安、健康，一心一意等待着能够回家和亲人团聚的日子。事实上，我们仅有的危险就是我们还会遭受美机的轰炸因而夺去我们能活到作为自由人重回到我们祖国的机会。我们希望全世界人民重视我们目前的处境。我们担忧的并不是在中国人民志愿军里作俘虏会有什么痛苦而是把我们送到这里来的那一帮子自私自利的战争贩子们会再来炸死我们。
    我们现在呼吁全世界爱好和平的人民团结起来，为了人道和公理，为了保障我们千百个俘虏同时也为了保障成千成万的朝鲜无辜的男女和儿童的生命和安全，向有关政府发出强硬抗议，要求立即停止这种可耻暴行。
    读到我们这封信的人们就会明白战争和滥肆轰炸的意义是什么，我们要特别向鹿特丹、考文特里、伦敦、华沙以及世界上其他地方曾在第二次世界大战中遭受过野蛮轰炸的人们呼吁，要求你们来支援我们。
    这个被某些人称为“警察行动”的“战争”，在我们看来是完全非正义的战争，美、英反动集团是不应该把它首先挑起的；但是，现在，所有世界上爱好和平的人民必须加紧斗争，以争取停止这个冲突并尽速建立真正的持久的和平。
    我们全心全意签署这个呼吁书，并希望全世界的民主报刊将它公布。
