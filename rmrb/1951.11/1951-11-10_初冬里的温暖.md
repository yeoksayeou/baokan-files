    Warmth in Early Winter
    Zhang Tao
    The scorched yellow leaves are falling to the ground; winter has arrived in Korea.
    I went to interview a artillery unit on the Western Front. The soldiers led me into their sturdy dugout, which is both their fighting fortress and their warm home. Thick dry grass is spread on the two stone slab "kangs" (heated brick beds). On the kang, there is a long table made of wooden planks, on which are placed newspapers, pictorials, and various booklets donated by the people of the motherland. Three windows are opened in the sunny direction of the dugout to allow plenty of light to enter. The soldiers are very fond of this battlefield home built by their own labor. During breaks in the fighting, they happily study here. In the vehicle shelter, all the winter preparations have also been arranged. The drivers are all chatting and laughing happily. Driver Sun Xilin told me that they have not only prepared the winter heating stoves, water tank cotton covers, and chains for climbing snowy mountains, but have also come up with many ways to drive in winter. They each guarantee that they will continuously transport grain and ammunition to the front lines in winter to ensure an adequate supply.
    The food in each company has been greatly improved. Deputy Company Commander Li Yongxiang said, "Now the soldiers can eat 70 percent refined grains, two dishes for each meal, two or three taels of meat per person per day, homemade soy milk in the morning, and they often eat more than a dozen kinds of non-staple foods such as canned goods, egg powder, sausage, peanuts, and beef jerky." Among all the non-staple foods, the most popular among the soldiers is egg powder, because it is easy to carry and has many uses. It can be used as dumpling filling, can be made into egg custard, or can be eaten with boiling water. If there is not enough time, it can also be eaten dry. Every time they eat, they think of the motherland. They say, "Remember that these rice and side dishes are all sent to us by the people of the motherland." Correspondent Chen Dexin, touching his red face, said, "I've gained a lot of weight and am full of energy. I'm not bragging, but I can carry a box of shells weighing 140 pounds for half a li." Recently, the unit's leadership decided to increase each soldier's daily ration by five qian of animal oil and one jin of vegetables in order to enhance the soldiers' physical strength to resist the cold. In addition, they are also preparing to purchase a large amount of ginger, pepper, and firewood for heating the kangs.
    The soldiers have all put on new cotton-padded clothes. This year's cotton-padded clothes are not only loose-fitting, sturdy, but also very beautiful. In the four pockets of the cotton-padded clothes are respectively packed patches, needles and thread, first-aid kits, etc. There are also windproof attachments on the chest of the cotton-padded clothes. When the soldiers put on these carefully made cotton-padded clothes, they wrote letters to Chairman Mao, the people of the motherland, and the comrades in the clothing factory, thanking them for their meticulous care for the volunteers. The letters said: "We feel warm in the early winter. This is given to us by the people of the motherland. We must kill more enemies and make more contributions, fight bravely, and strive for a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue." (Xinhua News Agency)

    初冬里的温暖
    张涛
    焦黄的树叶飘落在地上，朝鲜的冬季来到了。
    我到西线的一支炮兵部队去采访，战士们带着我走进坚固的掩蔽部，这里是他们作战的堡垒，也是他们的温暖之家。在两条石板搭成的炕上铺着厚厚的干草。炕中有一张用木板做的长案，上面放着祖国人民捐赠的报纸、画刊和各种小册子。在掩蔽部向阳的方向开了三个窗户，使掩蔽部内获得充分的光线。战士们很喜欢这种以自己劳动建造起来的战地家屋。每逢战斗间隙，他们就在这里愉快地学习。在汽车掩蔽部里，一切过冬的设备也都安排好了。司机们都在愉快地谈笑着。司机孙喜林告诉我：他们不但已准备好冬天用的烤车炉、水箱棉套和爬雪山用的链条，并且想出了许多冬天行车的办法。他们每个人都保证：在冬天要不断地把粮食和弹药运到前线，使前线得到充分的供应。
    各连队的伙食已经大大地改善。副连长李永祥说：“现在战士们能够吃到百分之七十的细粮，每顿饭两个菜，每人一天二、三两肉，早晨还有自制的豆浆，并且常吃到各种罐头食品、鸡蛋粉、香肠、花生米、牛肉干等十余种副食品。”在所有的副食品中，最使战士欢迎的是鸡蛋粉，因为这东西便于携带，用处也多，能当饺子馅，能做鸡蛋糕，也能用开水冲着吃，如果时间来不及也可以吃干的。他们每到吃饭时就想起祖国，他们说：“记住这些大米和小菜都是祖国人民给咱送来的。”通讯员陈德新摸着他红通通的脸孔说：“我胖得多了，混身是劲，不是说大话，一百四十斤重的一箱炮弹我能扛它半里地。”最近该部领导机关为了增强战士体力抵御寒冷，决定给每个战士每天增加五钱动物油、一斤菜，此外还准备购办大量的生姜、胡椒和烧炕用的干柴。
    战士们都已穿了新棉衣。今年的棉衣既宽大、结实，又很漂亮，在棉衣的四个口袋里分别装着补布、针线、救急包等物，在棉衣的胸襟上还有挡风的装备。战士们穿上这精心制做的棉衣时，纷纷写信给毛主席、祖国人民和被服厂的同志，感谢他们对志愿军无微不至的关怀，信上说：“在初冬里我们感到温暖，这是祖国人民给我们的，我们一定要多杀敌人多立功，奋勇战斗，争取和平解决朝鲜问题。”（新华社）
