    Xinhua News Agency, 1st—Notice from the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League Regarding the Celebration of the Soviet October Revolution Anniversary.
    The 34th Anniversary of the Soviet October Socialist Revolution is approaching. Local Communist Youth League committees should hold various gatherings around November 7th (or jointly with local organizations of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and other people's organizations) and use newspapers, magazines, slides, pictures, radio, and other tools to conduct extensive propaganda. The content of the propaganda should include the essence of the Soviet socialist state, the communist construction of the Soviet Union, the great role of the Soviet Union in the movement to defend world peace, and the great significance of Sino-Soviet friendship. To make the propaganda lively and vivid, these gatherings should, as far as possible, invite people who have been to the Soviet Union or have been in contact with Soviet experts working in China (adults, youths, and children are all welcome) to talk about their understanding and experience of the Soviet Union. With various specific facts, it should be emphasized that the sincere assistance of the Soviet Union to our country is an extremely important condition for the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the development of construction work.
