    Local Party Committees Respond to Chairman Mao's Call
    Actively Leading the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign
    CPC Hubei Provincial Committee Issues Instructions
    To Launch the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign
    The CPC Hubei Provincial Committee recently issued a notice on launching the increase production and practice economy campaign, calling on cadres throughout the province to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instruction on "continuing to strengthen the Resist America, Aid Korea work, increase production, and practice economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers." The Hubei Provincial Committee pointed out in the notice: The increase production and practice economy campaign should be carried out in conjunction with rectification and Party consolidation, to overcome corruption, waste, and bureaucratic work styles among cadres; further improve the political level of cadres, increase work efficiency, and prevent the emergence of degenerate thinking among some cadres; and improve the relationship between the Party and the masses. The corrupt behavior of a small number of cadres must be investigated and dealt with, and the extravagant and wasteful practices must be stopped immediately.
    The notice emphasized: Responsible comrades of all departments should take the lead in practicing economy, refrain from entertaining guests, giving gifts, or presenting banners, strictly implement financial systems, and maintain the fine tradition of hard work and simplicity. Party committees at all levels should select appropriate personnel to organize anti-corruption and anti-waste inspection teams, select key areas, conduct in-depth inspections, and immediately deal with any corruption and waste incidents found. Party committees at all levels should use various cadre meetings to mobilize the increase production and practice economy, mobilize cadres of organs and employees and workers of various enterprises to launch the increase production and practice economy campaign; and conduct a review of the patriotic pact, adding economy as a content.
    The notice concluded: All localities should combine the Resist America, Aid Korea and land reform work to launch the increase production and practice economy campaign under the leadership of the Party committee, and pay attention to mobilizing the peasants to carry out patriotic increase production and practice economy for famine preparedness.
    CPC Jinan Municipal Committee
        Arranges Increase Production and Practice Economy Work
    The CPC Jinan Municipal Committee convened a meeting of Party member cadres on the 13th of this month, at which Municipal Committee Secretary Gu Mu delivered a mobilization report on increasing production and practicing economy. Gu Mu first pointed out that all Party member cadres should resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instruction on "increasing production and practicing economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers." In his report, Gu Mu stated that although state-owned factories and enterprises in Jinan City had launched an increase production and practice economy campaign on the basis of democratic reform and wage adjustments, the results of this campaign were not significant because many cadres did not sufficiently recognize the significance of this movement. In government organs and groups, especially in some leading organs of the city, there was a serious phenomenon of extravagance and waste. Many units must hang lanterns and colored streamers, watch movies, see plays, make commemorative albums, and make commemorative badges for meetings, and individual units even use meetings to launch congratulatory gift-giving. Wasteful thinking seriously exists among cadres. Some people have even developed to the point of corruption, breaking laws and discipline. Some people ridicule comrades who maintain a style of hard work and simplicity as having a "rural perspective" or call them "country bumpkins." These erroneous ideas and bad tendencies must be quickly and resolutely corrected. Gu Mu pointed out: In order to implement Chairman Mao's instructions, all Party members in Jinan City should immediately mobilize, unite the people from all walks of life, resolutely implement the resolutions of the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, especially to rapidly and widely launch a mass movement focusing on increasing production and practicing economy in factories and rural suburbs, and a movement focusing on streamlining and economizing in government organs and groups. The following tasks should be carried out immediately: (1) All organs, enterprise Party committees, district committees, and all cadres in enterprise organs should immediately study the documents of the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and convey the resolutions of the Third Jinan Municipal People's Representative Conference on increasing production and practicing economy, so that staff members clearly recognize the great significance of increasing production and practicing economy, to ensure the smooth development of the increase production and practice economy campaign, and lay the foundation for the rectification movement in the city's organs in December, which focuses on streamlining and economizing and opposing extravagance and waste. At the same time, in the process of studying the documents, each unit should deliberate and formulate a plan to reduce levels, rationally use forces, improve work systems, and improve work efficiency, start to clear assets, and formulate a savings plan to quickly enter into action. (2) Establish the Jinan Municipal Organ Streamlining and Economy Committee, and immediately take effective measures to eliminate all extravagant and wasteful phenomena. (3) Strengthen the leadership of the increase production and practice economy campaign, hold working meetings for state-owned and private enterprises respectively, to specifically study the issue of increasing production and practicing economy, introduce advanced experiences, and promote the advancement of the movement.

    各地党委响应毛主席号召
    积极领导增产节约运动
    中共湖北省委指示
    开展增产节约运动
    中共湖北省委会于最近发出关于开展增加生产、厉行节约运动的通知，号召全省干部坚决贯彻毛主席关于“继续加强抗美援朝工作，增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的指示。湖北省委在通知中指出：开展增产节约运动，应与整风、整党结合进行，克服干部中的贪污浪费现象和官僚主义作风；进一步提高干部的政治水平，提高工作效率，防止某些干部蜕化思想的产生；改善党与群众的关系。对于少数干部的贪污腐化行为，必须追究处理；铺张浪费作风亦必须立即加以制止。
    通知着重指出：各部门负责同志应以身作则地厉行节约，不请客、不送礼、不送锦旗，严格执行财务制度，保持艰苦朴素的优良传统。各级党委应抽调适当人选组织反贪污浪费检查小组，选择重点，深入检查，发现贪污浪费事件，必须立即加以处理。各级党委应利用各种干部会议进行增产节约的动员，发动机关干部及各企业职员、工人开展增产节约运动；并把爱国公约作一次检查，把节约作为一项内容补充进去。
    通知最后指出：各地都应结合抗美援朝、土地改革等工作在党委领导下来开展增产节约运动，并注意在农民群众中进行爱国增产节约备荒的动员。
    中共济南市委
        布置增产节约工作
    中共济南市委会于本月十三日召开全市党员干部会议，由市委书记谷牧作关于增产节约的动员报告。谷牧首先指出，全体党员干部应坚决贯彻毛主席的“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的指示。谷牧在报告中谈到，济南市各国营工厂企业，虽曾在民主改革及调整工资的基础上开展过增产节约运动，但由于许多干部对这一运动的意义认识不足，因而这一运动的收获是不大的。而在机关团体、特别是市的某些领导机关中，还严重地存在着铺张浪费的现象。有许多单位开会必须悬灯结彩、看电影、看戏、制纪念册、制纪念章，甚至还有个别单位利用会议发动祝贺献礼。在干部中，严重地存在着浪费思想。有些人甚至发展到贪污腐化，违法乱纪的严重地步。对于保持艰苦朴素作风的同志，有些人则讥笑他们是“农村观点”，或称之为“土包子”。这些错误思想和不良倾向是必须迅速坚决纠正的。谷牧指出：为了贯彻毛主席的指示，济南市全体党员应立即动员起来，团结各界人民，坚决执行人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议的各项决议，特别要迅速、广泛地在工厂、郊区农村开展以增产节约为主、在机关团体中开展以整编节约为主的群众性的运动。目前应即进行下述工作：（一）全市各机关、企业党委，区委，企业机关中的全体干部立即学习人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议的各项文件，并传达济南市第三届各界人民代表会议有关增产节约的决议，使工作人员明确认识增产节约的重大意义，以保证增产节约运动的顺利开展，并打下十二月份全市机关以整编节约反铺张浪费为主要内容的整风运动的基础。同时，在学习文件过程中，各单位应酝酿拟订减少层次、合理使用力量、改进工作制度、提高工作效率的方案，着手清理资财，制定节约计划以便迅速地进入行动。（二）成立济南市机关整编节约委员会，立即采取有效方法，消灭一切铺张浪费现象。（三）加强对增产节约运动的领导，分别召开国营、私营企业工作会议，专门研究增产节约问题，介绍先进经验，推动运动前进。
