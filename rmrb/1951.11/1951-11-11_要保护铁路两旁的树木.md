    To Protect the Trees Along the Railway
    Comrade Editor: On October 8th, I traveled from Xuzhou, Shandong to Suxian County in northern Anhui on official business by train. Along the way, looking out the train window, I saw that many of the small trees planted along both sides of the railway subgrade had been cut down. It is said that this was mostly done by people gathering firewood. I think that planting trees along the subgrade not only utilizes empty land to produce wealth for the country, but mainly it can protect the subgrade. Now is the late autumn and early winter season, and there are especially many people gathering firewood in the wild. Therefore, I suggest that the railway engineering departments pay attention to inspection and contact the local village governments to jointly take responsibility for protecting the trees and educating the people who gather firewood.

    要保护铁路两旁的树木
    编辑同志：我在十月八日因公由山东徐州乘火车到皖北宿县去，一路上从车窗口向外眺望，看到沿铁路路基两旁栽植的小树很多都被砍伐掉。据说这大都是拾柴的人干的。我想，路基两旁植树不仅是利用空地为国家生产财富，主要是可以保护路基。现在正是秋末冬初的时候，在野外拾柴的人特别多。因此我建议铁路工务部门要注意检查，并和当地村政府联系，共同负责保护树木，对拾柴的人进行教育。　杨　晨
