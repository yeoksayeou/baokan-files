    Thoroughly Correct Actions Restricting People's Lawsuits

    In handling marriage cases, the following situation often occurs in various places: if the parties do not have a letter of introduction from the village government, the matter cannot be dealt with by the people's judicial organs in a timely and reasonable manner; even without a letter of introduction from the village or town, the district people's government or people's judicial organs will push the matter back to the village. It is as if the people must first obtain permission from the village government to file a lawsuit. This practice has no legal basis, but it seems to have become an unwritten litigation law. As a result, many internal disputes among the people cannot be resolved reasonably and in a timely manner; that is, the people's right to sue is restricted or even deprived for no reason. This practice must be corrected immediately so that the people can fully exercise their right to sue and their rights and interests are protected by law.

    During the Anti-Japanese War, the people's lawsuits in various anti-Japanese base areas faced many difficulties due to the enemy's blockade and division. Therefore, many internal disputes among the people inevitably had to be resolved in the villages, and the village mediation work was quickly established and improved. However, this also led to abuses later on. In some places, village government mediation was regarded as a mandatory procedure. If a matter was not mediated, the district and county people's governments refused to accept it. As a result, a case was often pushed back and forth, delayed for a long time without resolution. Many parties complained about this, complaining that there were too many "levels of review." Under such circumstances, the phenomenon of certain village cadres manipulating litigation arose, so that some parties said, "Anyway, we can't escape their (village cadres') grasp." It was also under these circumstances that it became easier for certain people to interfere with others' freedom of marriage. While shouting the slogan "Good girls don't leave the village," they abused their power to first prevent the women involved from leaving the village in terms of litigation. Therefore, the former North China People's Government's instructions on village mediation work specifically pointed out that village mediation is not a mandatory procedure.

    Now is the time to vigorously publicize the Marriage Law and vigorously implement the Marriage Law, and some areas are also promoting village mediation work and establishing village mediation committees; we should actively correct and prevent the abuses of restricting people's lawsuits that are occurring or have already existed.

    彻底纠正限制人民诉讼的行为
    各地在处理婚姻事件时，常常有这样的情形：如果当事人没有村政权的介绍信，事情就得不到人民司法机关的及时、合理的处理；甚至没有村或镇的介绍信，区人民政府或人民司法机关，就再往村里推。好像人民要打官司就必须先经过村政权的允许似的。这种作法，是毫无法令依据的，但无形中又好似成为一种不成文的诉讼法。这样，就使得好多人民内部的纠纷，不能及时地得到合理解决；也就是人民的诉讼权利，凭空地遭受了限制甚至被剥夺。这种作法，必须立即纠正，使人民充分行使诉讼权利，使他们的权益得到法律的保护。
    在抗日时期，各个抗日根据地由于敌人的封锁分割，人民的诉讼是有很多困难的，因而好多人民内部的纠纷，势必依靠在村中解决，因而村调解工作便很快地建立与健全起来。但这以后也曾发生了流弊，就是某些地方，把村政权调解当作了必经程序，遇事不经调解，区、县人民政府便拒不受理。这一来，常常把一个案件，推上推下，拖延很久而不能解决。不少当事人曾为此叫苦，抱怨“审级”太多。就在这种情形之下，产生了某些村干部操纵诉讼的现象，以致有的当事人说“反正跑不出他们（村干部）的手心儿去”。也就在这种情形下，更便利了某些人干涉人家的婚姻自由。他们一面喊出了“好女不出村”的口号，一面更滥用职权，首先使当事的妇女在诉讼上就不能出村。因此，前华北人民政府对于村调解工作的指示中，曾特别指出，村调解不是必经的程序。
    目前正是大张旗鼓宣传婚姻法、大力贯彻婚姻法的时候，有些地区又正是提倡村调解工作和建立村调解委员会的时候；我们应针对正在发生或早已存在的限制人民诉讼的流弊，积极加以纠正和防止。
