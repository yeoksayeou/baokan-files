　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 22nd: TASS reports that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko delivered a note to U.S. Acting Chargé d'Affaires to Moscow, Coemin, on November 21st, protesting the U.S. government's explicit legislation to fund subversive and destructive activities against the Soviet Union.

　　The Soviet government pointed out that U.S. President Truman signed the "Mutual Security Act of 1951" on October 10th, which allocates 100 million U.S. dollars to finance anti-revolutionary elements within the Soviet Union and people's democracies to engage in subversive and destructive activities, as well as traitors and war criminals who have fled these countries to engage in armed and other activities against their homelands.

　　The Soviet government pointed out that by passing this law, the U.S. government is grossly interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and committing an unprecedented violation of the norms of international law. This action is incompatible with normal relations between countries and the spirit of respecting national sovereignty. It can only be regarded as an aggressive action aimed at further complicating U.S.-Soviet relations and worsening the international situation. At the same time, this action by the U.S. government also seriously violates the obligations assumed by the United States when the Soviet Union and the United States resumed diplomatic relations in 1933. In the agreement on the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two countries, both sides guaranteed to develop diplomatic relations on the basis of mutual respect for each other's sovereignty and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, and guaranteed not to take any action that tends to incite or encourage armed intervention against the other party. The U.S. government has no right to establish sabotage groups and armed detachments to carry out subversive activities against the Soviet Union. This move by the U.S. government exposes it as an enemy of peace, violating its own obligations and brazenly trampling on the basic norms of international law and international relations.

　　The Soviet government solemnly declares that, in view of the U.S. government's new aggressive actions against the Soviet Union and the U.S.'s serious violation of the obligations it assumed in the 1933 agreement, the Soviet government lodges a strong protest with the U.S. government. The Soviet government believes that all responsibility for this action should be borne by the U.S. government; the Soviet government expects the U.S. government to take appropriate measures to abolish the aforementioned law.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris: Vyshinsky, the head of the Soviet delegation to the Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, wrote to the President of the United Nations General Assembly, Nafv, on the 22nd, suggesting that the following important and urgent issue be included in the agenda of the Sixth Session of the General Assembly: "The aggressive actions of the United States of America and interference in the internal affairs of other countries - manifested in the appropriation of 100 million U.S. dollars as funds to recruit personnel within and outside the territories of the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, and some other democratic countries, and to organize armed groups."

　　The memorandum on this issue states that on October 10, 1951, U.S. President Truman signed the "Mutual Security Act of 1951," which stipulates the allocation of 100 million U.S. dollars to be used - as the law indicates - to supply any specially selected personnel residing in the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania... or personnel who have escaped from these countries, or to organize them into armed forces to support the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The memorandum further emphasizes that, therefore, this law stipulates the organization of subversive and destructive activities in the aforementioned countries, and the funding of traitors and war criminals who have fled their countries and taken refuge in the United States and several other countries, which is an act of aggression against the Soviet Union and the people's democracies.

　　The memorandum states that such direct interference in the internal affairs of other countries by the United States of America violates universally recognized principles of international law and the basic principles of the United Nations Charter.

　　The memorandum states that by passing this law, the United States is also in complete violation of the Soviet-American agreement concluded on November 16, 1933, when the Soviet Union and the United States established diplomatic relations, according to which both parties mutually guaranteed not to financially support and support military organizations or other organizations aimed at changing the political or social system of the contracting parties by force.

　　美政府竟无耻制定资助反苏分子的法律       
    苏联向美国政府提出坚决抗议       
    维辛斯基建议联大讨论美国这侵略行动
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十二日讯：苏联外交部副部长葛罗米柯在十一月二十一日以照会一件递交美国驻莫斯科代理代办柯明，抗议美国政府明文规定资助对苏联实行颠覆和破坏活动的法律。
    苏联政府指出：美国杜鲁门总统曾在十月十日签署了一项“一九五一年共同安全法”，规定拨出一亿美元，作为在苏联及各人民民主国家境内的反革命分子从事颠覆和破坏活动以及这些国家逃亡国外的卖国贼和战争罪犯从事反对祖国的武装活动和其他活动的经费。
    苏联政府指出，美国政府通过这个法律，是对其他国家内政的粗暴干涉，也是对国际法准则的史无前例的破坏；这种行动是与各国家的正常关系和尊重各国主权的精神不相容的。它只能被认为是一种侵略性的行动，目的在使美苏关系更趋复杂，使国际局势更加恶化。同时，美国政府这一行动也严重地违反了一九三三年苏美复交时美国所承担的义务。在两国复交的协定中，双方曾保证在互相尊重对方主权和互不干涉对方内政的基础上发展外交关系，保证绝对不采取任何有唆使或鼓励武装干涉对方之倾向的行动。美国政府决没有权利成立破坏集团和武装的派遣队来进行反对苏联的颠覆活动。美国政府这种举动暴露了它是和平的敌人，它破坏自己所承担的义务和蛮横地蹂躏国际法和国际关系的基本准则。
    苏联政府郑重声明：鉴于美国政府对苏联的新的侵略性行动和美国严重地违反了它在一九三三年协定中所承担的义务，苏联政府特向美国政府提出坚决抗议。苏联政府认为这种行动的一切责任应由美国政府担负；苏联政府期望美国政府采取适当措施废除上项法律。
    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社巴黎讯：出席联合国第六届大会的苏联代表团团长维辛斯基，在二十二日写信给联合国大会主席纳孚，建议把下列重要而迫切的问题列入第六届大会的议程：“美利坚合众国的侵略行动及对其他国家内政的干涉——表现为拨款一亿美元作为经费，在苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚和其他的某些民主国家及这些国家领土之外招募人员，并组织武装集团。”
    关于这个问题的备忘录说：一九五一年十月十日，美国总统杜鲁门签署了“一九五一年共同安全法”，这项法案规定拨款一亿元，用来——正如这个法律所指出的——供给住在苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚……的任何特选的人员，或是从这些国家逃出的人员，或用来把他们组成支持北大西洋公约组织的武装部队的队伍。备忘录进一步着重指出：因此，这项法律是规定在上述国家内组织颠覆活动和破坏活动，资助那些从他们国家逃出而在美国和若干其他国家避难的卖国贼和战争罪犯，这是对苏联及各人民民主国家的侵略行动。
    备忘录说：美利坚合众国这种直接干涉他国内政的行为，违反了普遍承认的国际法原则和联合国宪章的基本原则。
    备忘录说：美国通过这项法律，也是完全违反了一九三三年十一月十六日苏联和美国建立外交关系时所缔结的苏美协定，根据这项协定，双方相互保证不以金钱资助和支持目的在于以武力改变缔约国的政治或社会制度的军事组织或其他组织。
