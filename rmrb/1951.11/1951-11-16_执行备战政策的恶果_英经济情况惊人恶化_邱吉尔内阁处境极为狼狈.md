Xinhua News Agency, London, 14th: The British economic situation is deteriorating alarmingly. Churchill and the members of his new cabinet, who have just taken office, have therefore fallen into an extremely embarrassing situation. In recent days, they have had to admit to the new parliament that the British economic crisis has developed to a far more serious extent than the British public generally imagines.

The King's Speech, read at the opening ceremony of the current parliament on the 6th, emphasized that the crisis in the British economy "is more important than all other domestic issues." The King said: "My government is very concerned about the economic situation of the United Kingdom, and this situation must be explained to the country in detail."

On the same day, Churchill delivered his first speech to Parliament after taking office as Prime Minister. He began by saying: "Arduous work lies ahead for the government, and serious responsibilities fall on the shoulders of the new parliament." He believed that the current "financial and economic situation" of Britain is "the most serious issue that must be brought before the House." The House continued its meeting on the 7th, and the new Chancellor of the Exchequer, Butler, made what he called a "painful statement" on the same issue, explaining that as a result of pursuing a policy of arms expansion and war preparation, Britain has suffered a crisis of "bankruptcy and starvation."

Among the crises penetrating all aspects of British economic life, the first is the soaring rise in the foreign exchange deficit due to trade deficits. According to Churchill himself: "In terms of foreign payments, Britain is in a crisis of overspending, which is even more severe than in 1949, and in many ways even more serious than in 1947. In the most recent six months, Britain's foreign payments deficit has reached an annual rate of 700 million pounds, while in the same period last year there was a surplus of 350 million pounds at an annual rate." Churchill then stated that, compared with the past, "this means a loss in payments at an annual rate of over 1 billion pounds. If the current trends and policies continue, and not counting any conceivable further losses, next year Britain's total foreign payments deficit will reach a figure of 500 million to 600 million pounds." Moreover, for the entire sterling area, "the loss of centrally stored gold and dollar reserves may be much greater." "Simply put, we are now buying far more than we can afford to pay for with our own earnings, and this situation can only lead to national bankruptcy sooner or later." Chancellor of the Exchequer Butler's statement further "shocked" the House. He announced that in October alone, Britain's dollar deficit was as high as 320 million dollars, which reduced Britain's gold and dollar reserves sharply to 2.949 billion dollars in one month. Consuming at this rate, Britain's gold and dollar reserves will be completely depleted within a year. Butler also said: If the current situation continues, "we will not be able to buy what we need. ... In fact, we will go bankrupt, without work and without food."

The severe coal shortage looming this winter is another issue that is causing the Churchill government anxious concern. In his speech on the 6th, Churchill said that household coal reserves are only half of what they were last year, which is lower than at any time since the war. He made it clear that he could not guarantee that there would be no difficulties before the end of winter.

The food supply situation is also very bad. Food Minister Lloyd George announced at the House of Commons meeting on the 9th: "Due to Britain's financial situation, Britain's food supply is in an extremely dangerous situation similar to that of 1941"
(Note: 1941 was the year in which Britain suffered the most severe food shortage during World War II, when British food imports were drastically reduced due to German submarine attacks.) "Our reserves of wheat, flour, margarine, cooking oil, sugar and butter, etc., are all far below the levels of 1941." According to Churchill himself, the meat supply is also worse than during the war.

Given the extreme seriousness of the situation, the Churchill government hurriedly took a number of so-called "severe" measures, attempting to reduce the economic crisis caused by the expansion of military needs by cutting back on the needs of the people. When Chancellor of the Exchequer Butler reported on the economic situation in the House on the 7th, he announced a plan that the United Press called a "super-economy" plan, which stipulates that imports from non-sterling areas will be reduced by 350 million pounds per year, of which food imports will be the first to be cut. According to Reuters, Butler openly admitted that "this huge cut means a reduction in some food rations." Not only that, but the quantity of non-rationed food will also be reduced. Butler also announced that he would raise the Bank of England's lending rate and stop "building houses", although not long ago, "the Conservative Party had guaranteed in its election campaign that it would build 300,000 houses a year".

In this way, the Churchill government has exposed from the start its true face of preparing for war at the expense of sacrificing the British people to an even greater extent. As the United Press said, "The British people cannot expect to avoid the financial drain of arms expansion and war preparation, and they must prepare to tighten their belts." But Churchill's "severe" measures are obviously not tolerable to the British people. It is precisely for this reason that Churchill himself has guiltily talked about the government not being afraid to do some things that it considers "necessary" but "unpopular". Butler also said helplessly when announcing his plan: "This is an action that the government is very disgusted with but has to take."

### 执行备战政策的恶果  英经济情况惊人恶化  邱吉尔内阁处境极为狼狈

　　执行备战政策的恶果
    英经济情况惊人恶化
    邱吉尔内阁处境极为狼狈
    【新华社十四日讯】伦敦消息：英国经济状况正在惊人地恶化。刚刚上台的邱吉尔及其新内阁的阁员已因此而陷入极其狼狈的处境中。连日以来，他们在新议会中不得不承认一个事实：英国的经济危机已发展到远比英国一般人想像的情况更为严重的程度。
    在六日举行的本届议会开幕式上宣读的英王的开幕词，就着重指出英国经济的危机“比其他一切国内问题都更为重要”。英王说：“我的政府对于联合王国的经济情况很担心，这种情况必须向全国作详尽的说明。”
    同一天，邱吉尔在议会中发表他就任首相后的第一次演说。他一开头就表示：“艰苦的工作展开在政府的面前，严重的责任落在新议会的肩头。”他认为：英国当前的“财政和经济情况”是“必须向下院提出的最严重的问题”。七日下院继续开会，新任财政大臣巴特勒在会上就同一问题发表了他自称为“沉痛的声明”，说明由于奉行扩军备战政策的结果，英国已遭到“破产和饥饿”的危机。
    在深入英国经济生活各方面的危机中，首先是由于贸易入超而来的外汇赤字的飞跃上升。据邱吉尔自己说：“在对外支付方面，英国正处于入不敷出的危机下，这种危机比一九四九年还要厉害，在许多方面，甚至比一九四七年的情况还要严重。在最近的半年中，英国的对外支付赤字已达到每年七亿英镑的数额，而去年同时期还有年率三亿五千万英镑的盈余”。邱吉尔接着表明：前后相比，“意味着支付方面的亏损年率超过十亿英镑。如果按照目前的趋势和政策、并且不把可以设想的进一步的损失计算在内的话，明年英国对外支付的总赤字就要达到五亿英镑到六亿英镑的数额。”不仅如此，就整个英镑区说来，“中央储存的黄金美元储备的损失可能还要大得多”。“简单地说，我们现在买进来的东西远远超过我们自己赚来的钱所能够偿付的数量，而这种情况迟早只会造成国家的破产。”财政大臣巴特勒的声明进一步使下院“震惊”。他宣布，仅仅在十月份中，英国的美元赤字就高达三亿二千万美元，一个月之间，使英国的黄金美元储备锐减至二十九亿四千九百万美元。按这样的速率消耗，英国的黄金美元储备不出一年就要全部耗光。巴特勒还说：目前的情况如果继续下去，“我们将不能购买我们所需要的东西。……事实上，我们将要破产，无工可作，也无饭可吃”。
    今冬迫在眉睫的严重煤荒是又一个使邱吉尔政府焦急不安的问题。邱吉尔在六日的发言中说，家用煤炭的储存量只有去年的一半，这个数量低于战后以来的任何时期。他明白表示，不能保证在冬季结束以前没有困难。
    粮食供应情况同样是非常恶劣的。粮食大臣劳合—乔治在九日下院的会议上宣布：“由于英国的财政状况，英国的粮食供应已处于和一九四一年
    （按：一九四一年是英国在第二次世界大战中粮荒最严重的一年，当时的英国食物进口由于德国潜艇的袭击而剧烈减少。）情况相同的极端危险的境地中。”“我们储存的小麦、面粉、人造牛油、烹调油脂、食糖与牛油等等都大大低于一九四一年的水平。”根据邱吉尔本人透露，肉类供应也比战争期间的情况恶劣。
    鉴于局势的极度严重，邱吉尔政府慌忙采取了若干所谓“严厉”的措施，企图以削减人民生活的需要，来减轻由于军事需要膨胀而引起的经济危机。财政大臣巴特勒七日在下院报告经济情况时，就宣布了一项被合众社称为“超级节约”的计划，规定每年削减从非英镑区来的进口货三亿五千万英镑，其中首先遭到削减的是食物进口。据路透社消息，巴特勒公开承认，“此次巨额的削减意味着对若干食物配给的削减”。不仅如此，非配给的食品数量也要遭到削减。巴特勒同时还宣布，将提高英格兰银行放款利率并停止“建筑房屋”，虽然不久以前，“保守党在竞选运动中曾保证它每年建筑房屋三十万栋”。
    这样，邱吉尔政府一开始就暴露了它的为了准备战争不惜变本加厉牺牲英国人民的真面目。正如合众社所说，“英国人民不能期望避免扩军备战的财政消耗，他们必须准备勒紧裤腰带。”但是邱吉尔的“严厉”措施，显然不能为英国人民所容忍。正是因为这个缘故，邱吉尔自己就曾经作贼心虚地谈到，政府并不害怕作一些它认为“必要的”但是“不受欢迎的事情”。巴特勒在宣布他的计划时也无可奈何地说：“这是政府非常厌恶但又不得不采取的行动。”
