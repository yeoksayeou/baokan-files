    Central-South China State-Owned Trade Departments Set Production Increase and Savings Goals
    9.3 Trillion Yuan in Planned Production Increase and Savings for Next Year
    The state-owned trade departments in Central-South China have preliminarily set a goal of 9.3 trillion yuan for production increases and savings in the coming year. Among them, the twelve specialized company systems in the region can reduce expenditures on commodity circulation costs by 8 trillion yuan. Local trade companies, trust companies, retail companies, etc., throughout the region can save about 300 billion yuan compared to this year's expense levels. The processing plants attached to the various specialized companies throughout the region can increase production and savings by 1 trillion yuan through improving efficiency, management, and reducing costs. The focus of the savings campaign in the Central-South China trade departments next year will be on reducing commodity circulation costs, with improving storage and transportation work as the central link for savings. According to statistics, expenditures in this area in Central-South China account for about 58% of the total commodity circulation costs. Based on this year's standards, it is estimated that 25% can be saved from the planned figure next year. Currently, the Third Trade Planning Conference of Central-South China is being held. This conference will discuss in detail the steps and methods for the production increase and savings plan and specific implementation plans.
    Due to their efforts to improve business management, the state-owned trade departments in various parts of Central-South China have achieved great success in saving expenses this year. Last year, commodity circulation costs accounted for 16% of the commodity circulation volume, and it is expected to be reduced to 13.5% this year. Under the patriotic education of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, many employees are actively seeking ways to reduce the loss of state assets and save expenses. The most significant of these is the savings in storage and transportation costs. According to incomplete statistics for the past nine months, the entire region has saved more than 61 billion yuan. In the past, various departments often had round-trip transfers and cargo "travel" phenomena when allocating materials. Now, direct transportation methods are used to reduce transportation costs. For example, the Salt Industry Company adopted a direct transportation method to transport salt to Ji'an, Ganzhou, and Fuzhou, which will save 1.5 billion yuan in transportation and miscellaneous expenses this year. The Jiangxi Provincial Grain Company paid attention to selecting inexpensive transportation tools. After changing the transportation of grain from Xingguo County to Taihe County from trucks to rafts, statistics from the first half of this year alone show that 1.3 billion yuan was saved. Secondly, the method of delivering goods directly from the original vehicles and ships without entering the warehouse saved a lot of loading and unloading costs. The Henan Provincial Grain Company, in close contact with the Provincial Grain Administration and local government departments, implemented a one-time warehousing method for trade grain, saving more than 6.2 billion yuan in expenses alone. The Salt Industry Companies in Ganzhou, Jiangxi, and Yiyang, Hunan, often discussed arrangements with customers before the salt arrived, and delivered the salt directly from the original vehicles when it arrived, saving huge labor and material resources and losses in and out of warehouses. In terms of storage, many departments have improved storage methods, increased storage space, eliminated accidents, reduced losses, and employees have automatically cleared warehouses, dried, moved, weighed, etc., which has also saved a lot of expenses. The achievements made by the staff of the state-owned trade departments in Central-South China over the past year have laid a favorable foundation for carrying out the production increase and savings movement in the future.

    中南区国营贸易部门确定增产节约奋斗目标
    明年计划增产节约九千三百亿元
    中南区国营贸易部门初步确定了明年度增产节约的奋斗目标为九千三百亿元。其中全区十二个专业公司系统在商品流转费用上可减少开支八千亿元，全区地方贸易公司、信托公司、零售公司等在今年费用支出水平上可节约三百亿元左右，全区各专业公司附设的加工厂，从提高效率、改善管理、降低成本等各方面可增产节约一千亿元。中南贸易部门明年的节约运动以节省商品流转费用为主，其中又以改善储存和运输工作为节约的中心环节。据统计，中南区这一方面的支出约占全部商品流转费用的百分之五十八，根据今年标准计算，估计明年可在拟定数字中节省百分之二十五。现在中南区第三届贸易计划会议正在举行。这次会议将详细讨论增产节约计划和具体执行计划的步骤和方法。
    中南区各地国营贸易部门由于努力改善经营管理，今年在节省开支方面已取得很大的成绩。去年商品流转费占商品流转额的百分之十六，预计今年可减低到百分之十三点五。在抗美援朝爱国主义思想教育下，许多员工都积极设法减少国家资财的损失和节省开支。其中最显著的是储存和运输费用的节省。据九个月来不完全的统计，全区共节省开支六百一十亿余元。过去各部门调拨物资，常常有往返周转，货物旅行的现象，现在采用了直接运输的办法，减低了运费的开支。如盐业公司采取了直接运输办法运盐到吉安、赣州、抚州三地，今年即可节省运费、杂费十五亿元。江西省粮食公司注意选用了廉价的运输工具，把原来用汽车从兴国县运到泰和县的粮食改用木筏运输后，仅据今年上半年的统计，就节省十三亿元。其次是采用货不进仓就原车、原船交货的办法，节省了大量的装卸搬运费。河南省粮食公司和该省粮食管理局及地方政府部门取得密切联系，实行贸易粮一次入库办法，仅开支方面就节省了六十二亿余元。江西赣州和湖南益阳等地盐业公司经常在盐未到前就和顾主商量好，在食盐运到时就原车拨交，节省了巨额进出仓库力资及损耗。在保管方面，由于许多部门改进储存方法，增加仓位，消灭事故，减少损失以及职工自动清仓、翻晒、搬运、过磅等，也节省了不少开支。中南区国营贸易部门的职工，一年以来所获得的这些成绩，给今后开展增产节约运动奠定了有利基础。（新华社）
