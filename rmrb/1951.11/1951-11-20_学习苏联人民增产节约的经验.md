Learning from the Soviet People's Experience in Increasing Production and Practicing Economy
	Qin Benli

Comrade Stalin said: "Economy is one of the important laws of capital accumulation in a socialist society."

Historically, there have been several different methods of industrialization. Comrade Stalin pointed out that methods like Britain's, which relied on plundering colonies to absorb foreign capital, and Germany's, which relied on obtaining reparations from defeated countries, were "dirty ways of absorbing industrialization funds." There was also a method like that of old Russia, which involved obtaining enslaving loans from imperialism. "This is a path of enslavement or semi-enslavement." Stalin stated unequivocally that these methods violated the nature of the Soviet regime and were not viable for the Soviet people. Naturally, they are also not viable for the victorious Chinese people.

There is only one method, Comrade Stalin said: "The path of saving for industry ourselves, the path of socialist accumulation, this path, as Comrade Lenin repeatedly pointed out, is the only path for our industrialization." (See "Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction," Volume 2, page 58). This path is also the only path for our New China. Thanks to the establishment of a state economy of a socialist nature, we now also have this condition.

The only path to industrialization for our New China is to follow the path pointed out by Lenin and Stalin. The path that the Soviet people have taken to victoriously build socialism is the path of moving towards industrialization through internal accumulation of funds. This is our only path.

At every stage of socialist construction, increasing production and practicing economy is a most important method. Not long after the October Revolution, the wounds of war had not yet healed, and imperialism shamefully carried out armed intervention and economic blockade. At this time, the task facing the Soviet people was arduous. At this time, Lenin put forward a general slogan for the struggle, which included the content of increasing production and practicing economy:

"Accurately and honestly calculating money, saving economically, not being lazy, not stealing from the public to enrich oneself, observing the strictest discipline in labor,... has already become the urgent and main slogan at present."

Lenin also incisively explained the great significance of this slogan. He said:

"On the one hand, the practical implementation of these slogans by the working masses is the only condition for saving the country, which has been brought to the brink of death by the imperialist war and the imperialist bandits (led by Kerensky); on the other hand, the practical implementation of these slogans by the Soviet regime, in its own way and according to its own laws, is a necessary and sufficient condition for the complete victory of socialism." (See Lenin, "The Current Tasks of the Soviet Government")

The Soviet people went through the "New Economic Policy period" and began the construction of socialist industrialization. At this time, Stalin brilliantly pointed out that it was necessary to rely on the path of socialist accumulation and confidently pointed out the reliable sources of socialist accumulation. Even so, Stalin still believed that:

"However, things are not limited to and cannot be limited to accumulation alone. We must also be good at spending the accumulated reserves reasonably and calculatingly, not wasting a penny of the people's wealth, and ensuring that the accumulation is mainly used to meet the important needs of our industrialization."

If "these conditions are not met, we will be in danger of wasting the accumulated wealth, of dispersing this wealth into various large and small expenditures that have nothing to do with the development of industry or the promotion of the entire national economy."

This issue was a new test for the Soviet people. The situation at that time was, as Stalin said: "Being good at spending wealth reasonably and calculatingly is a most important art, and this art cannot be achieved all at once. It cannot be said that our Soviet and cooperative organs are very proficient in this regard. On the contrary, all materials show that we are still far from it." On the other hand, Lenin pointed out: "We must eliminate all traces of waste in state organs, and there are still many such traces left in our state organs by Tsarist Russia and its bureaucratic capitalist organs." At the same time, as Lenin repeatedly pointed out, the non-proletarian, boastful, lazy, extravagant, selfish, and conservative remnants of consciousness were still seriously reflected in the ranks of the proletariat. All these kinds of consciousness and behaviors that violated the principle of socialist accumulation and the principle of economy were still playing a corrosive role at that time. Therefore, Stalin called on the Soviet people:

"Comrades, admit that this is painful, but it is a fact that cannot be covered up by any resolution."

Therefore, Stalin pointed out: "It is necessary to take various measures to protect our accumulation, avoid waste, avoid dispersal, avoid squandering it on unnecessary uses, and prevent it from deviating from the basic line of our industrial construction." This is a necessary condition for pushing towards a great future.

Therefore, Stalin deeply hated wasteful behavior that did not cherish the people's wealth.

For example, Stalin said: "People sometimes forget that without some minimum amount of wealth, without certain minimum reserves, it is impossible to make any industrial plan, nor can we build such or such 'large' and 'all-encompassing' enterprises. They forget these things and run ahead." What does this mean? This is called "not acting according to one's ability." Stalin pointed out: "We do not need to lag behind the process of industrial development, nor do we need to run ahead. We need to move forward at the same level as the development of industry, and we need to promote industry without disconnecting it from its foundations." That is, industrial plans should not be formulated in a bureaucratic and fictitious way. Otherwise, it is incompatible with the principle of thriftily and rationally utilizing accumulation.

For example: State institutions have excessive "redundant staff" and "lavish eating and drinking" phenomena. Lenin and Stalin said: "Workers and peasants cannot bear our large and expensive state organs, and no matter how necessary it is, we must use all means and methods to streamline them." "Finally, we must seriously start doing this in a Bolshevik spirit and implement a strict system of economy." Stalin gave a vivid example, that is, the grain procurement organs spent more money to procure grain. They believed that before procuring grain, they must expand their staff... "This created a large amount of non-productive expenditure, and when the final account was settled, it was found that our exports were not cost-effective." Therefore, Stalin pointed out: "If we do not take extremely strict measures to stop the lavish eating and drinking of our state organs, the wealth we have accumulated will continue to be spent in this way."

For example: Various wastes exist in life. Stalin said: "We now have prevalent banquets, various festivals, grand meetings, commemorative ceremonies, and monument openings. These 'things' cost tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of rubles. There are many initiators of various celebrations and lovers of grand ceremonies among us. Half-year, anniversary, two-year anniversary, and other celebrations are really astounding in number, and it would take tens of millions of rubles to meet this need." Stalin believed that this was not the extravagant behavior that Communists should have. Regarding this extravagance and waste, Stalin pointed out: "If we are willing to effectively economize on our accumulation to meet the needs of our industry, then we should launch a resolute struggle against extravagance and waste in our management organs and our lives."

"It is time to end this extravagant behavior that Communists should not have."

For example: Regarding theft, Stalin strictly exposed a situation that existed at that time. "What is more noteworthy here is not the thief himself, but the fact that the surrounding masses, knowing the thief clearly, not only do not fight him, but on the contrary, pat him on the shoulder and praise his cleverness. As a result, the thief becomes a hero in people's eyes." "This is noteworthy, and it is also the most dangerous." Why is this a noteworthy and most dangerous situation? Stalin explained: "When a spy or traitor is caught, the anger of the masses is boundless, and everyone demands that they be shot. But when a thief is active in everyone's eyes, stealing state property, the surrounding masses are limited to benevolent smiles and pats on the shoulder." In response to this dangerous situation, Stalin specifically pointed out: "It is very clear that thieves who steal the people's property and harm the interests of the national economy are also spies and traitors, if not worse." Although such thieves are arrested by state organs, Stalin believed that "here we need other, more effective, and more serious methods. This method is to create an atmosphere of general moral resistance and hatred among the surrounding masses around these thieves." Make these thieves unable to live and exist in this atmosphere. "Eliminating theft is one of the means of protecting our accumulation and avoiding waste." Stalin pointed out that a systematic struggle must be waged against theft.

In addition, Stalin also exposed a waste, that is, "If we do not stop absenteeism, if labor productivity remains stagnant and does not increase, we will not be able to advance our industry, nor will we be able to raise wages." Therefore, we must make it clear to the workers: "Absenteeism and failure to advance labor productivity are harmful to the common cause, harmful to the entire working class, and harmful to our industry." (The above quotes are from Stalin's "On the Soviet Economic Situation and the Party's Policy").

Under the earnest teachings of Lenin and Stalin, under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, and under the resolute struggle of the Soviet proletariat against the remnants of non-proletarian ideology, the many serious phenomena of waste mentioned above were quickly overcome, and the attitude of cherishing and consolidating public wealth and the communist conscious attitude towards labor have become the noble qualities of which the Soviet people are proud of the world. It is precisely because the Soviet people have these qualities that they dedicate themselves to the construction of the socialist country and the construction of communism with vigor.

It is precisely because of this that after the Second World War, although the material losses brought to the Soviet people by the enemy amounted to 679 billion rubles, as a result of the Soviet people's efforts to increase production and practice economy, in 1948, they exceeded the cost reduction plan stipulated for that year. The value of the surplus plan obtained due to the reduction of industrial product costs was more than 8 billion rubles. The production level in this year exceeded the pre-war level of 1940 by 18 percent. By 1950, industrial output had exceeded the pre-war level of 1940 by 73 percent. This greatly exceeded the requirement of Stalin's first post-war five-year plan to exceed the pre-war 1940 level by 48 percent. The total agricultural output in 1950 also far exceeded the pre-war level. As a result of the four price reductions, the Soviet people benefited by as much as 301.5 billion rubles. The material and cultural life of the Soviet people has also improved compared to the pre-war period. They also selflessly and promptly gave valuable assistance to the people's democratic countries. Now, the Soviet people are victoriously marching towards communism.

The victorious completion of the post-war five-year plan is a brilliant example of the Soviet people, under the leadership and education of Stalin and the Soviet Communist Party, giving full play to their high degree of initiative and creativity, working hard, increasing production and practicing economy, and working diligently to achieve.

The present of the Soviet Union is our future. The spirit of nation-building of the Soviet people is the example we should learn from. Chairman Mao has called on us: "Increase production, practice strict economy, to support the Chinese People's Volunteers." The working class in Northeast China has created a good example of increasing production and saving 10.04 million tons of grain. Let us, under the victorious banner of Mao Zedong, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet people in nation-building and strive for greater victories.

　　学习苏联人民增产节约的经验
    钦本立
    斯大林同志说：“节约是社会主义社会资金积累重要法则之一。”
    历史上曾有几种不同的工业化方法。斯大林同志指出：像英国靠劫掠殖民地以吸收外来资金的方法、像德国靠从战败国取得赔款的方法，这是用“龌龊办法来吸收工业化资金的。”还有一种方法，像旧的俄国，向帝国主义取得奴役性借款的方法。“这是一种奴役或半奴役的道路。”斯大林斩钉截铁地说，这些方法违反苏维埃政权的本性，对苏联人民都是走不通的。自然，对于胜利了的中国人民，也都是走不通的。
    只有一种方法，斯大林同志说：“为了工业而自己节约的道路，社会主义积累的道路，这条道路，列宁同志曾多次地指出过，乃是我国工业化的唯一道路。”（见列宁斯大林论社会主义经济建设下册第五八页）。这条道路，也正是我们新中国唯一的道路。由于社会主义性质的国家经济的建立，我们今天也已具备了这个条件。
    我们新中国工业化的唯一道路，只有走列宁、斯大林所指出的道路。苏联人民胜利地建设社会主义所经历的道路，这就是从本国内部积累资金走向工业化的道路。这是我们唯一的道路。
    社会主义建设的每个阶段，增产节约都是一个最重要的方法。十月革命不久，战争的创伤还未恢复，帝国主义又可耻地进行了武装干涉和经济封锁，这时，摆在苏联人民面前的任务是艰苦的。这时，列宁提出了斗争总口号，这个总口号就包括了增产节约的内容：
    “精确而诚实地计算金钱，节省经济，不懒惰，不盗公肥私，在劳动中遵守最严格的纪律，……却已变成目前迫切的主要口号了。”
    列宁还精辟地解释了这个口号的重大意义。他说：
    “一方面，劳动群众切实执行这些口号，便是挽救被帝国主义战争和帝国主义强盗们（以克伦斯基为首）弄得半死半活的国家的唯一条件；另一方面，由苏维埃政权，用自己的方法，根据自己的法令来切实执行这些口号，又是社会主义彻底胜利所必要的和足够的条件。”（见列宁著：苏维埃政权底当前任务）
    苏联人民经过了“新经济政策时期”，着手社会主义工业化的建设。这时，斯大林就天才地指出了只有依靠社会主义积累的道路，并充满信心地指出了社会主义积累的可靠的来源。虽然如此，但斯大林仍认为：
    “不过事情不限于也不能限于积累而已。还要善于合理地、有计算地支出积累起来的后备金，不要白白花掉人民财力的任何一文，要使积累基本上用于满足我国工业化的重要需要。”
    如果“没有这些条件，我们就要遭受浪费所积累的财力之危险，遭受把这些财力分散于既与发展工业又与推进整个国民经济毫无关系的各种大大小小支出的危险。”
    这个问题，对于苏联人民是一个新的考验。当时的情形，正如斯大林所说：“善于合理地、有计算地支出财力——这是一件最重要的艺术，这种艺术是不能一下子成功的。不能说，我们苏维埃的及合作社的机关，在这一点上，是十分精通的了。相反的，所有材料都说明，我们在这方面还差得很远。”另方面，列宁曾指出：“我们必须把国家机关中所有一切浪费现象的遗迹铲除干净，而沙皇俄罗斯及其官僚资本主义机关所遗留在我们国家机关中的这种遗迹，尚是很多的。”同时，又正如列宁所屡次指出的，在无产阶级队伍里，还严重地反映出非无产阶级的浮夸的、懒惰的、奢侈的、自私的、保守的各种残余的意识。所有这些违反社会主义的积累原则、违反节约原则的各种意识和行为，在当时还在起着腐蚀的作用的。所以，斯大林向苏联人民号召说：
    “同志们，承认这是痛苦的，但这是一件不能用任何决议案掩盖的事实。”
    所以，斯大林指出：“必须采取多种办法，以保护我们的积累，避免浪费，避免分散，避免把它蹧蹋于不需要的用途，避免使它离开了我们工业建设底基本路线，乃是必要的。”这正是推向远大前程的必要条件。
    所以斯大林对于不爱惜人民财力的浪费行为，是深恶痛绝的。
    例如：斯大林说：“人们有时忘记了，没有一些最低限度的财力，没有某些最低限度的后备金，既不可能制作任何工业计划，也不能建设这样或那样
    ‘广大的’和‘包罗一切的’企业。他们忘记了这些，而跑在前面去了。”这是什么意思呢？这叫做“不量力而行”。斯大林指出：“我们既不需要落后于工业发展的进程，也不需要跑在前面。我们需要和工业的发展在同一水平上前进，我们需要推进工业，不使它和它的基础脱节。”这就是，工业计划不应当按官僚主义虚构的办法制定。不然，对俭省地合理利用积累的原则是不相容的。
    例如：国家机构有过多的“冗员”及“大吃大喝”现象。列宁斯大林说：“工人和农民不堪忍受我们的庞大而昂贵的国家机关，不论如何需要用一切办法和手段，精简它们。”“最后，必须认真地以布尔什维克精神着手作这件事，要实行严格的节约制度。”斯大林举出了一个活的例子，就是粮食采办机关花掉了更多的钱去采办粮食。认为采办粮食之前，必须扩充自己的职员名额……“造成了一大笔非生产的支出，最后一结帐，发现我们的出口是不合算的”了。所以，斯大林指出：“如果我们不采取极严格的办法，来制止我们国家机关底大吃大喝，我们所积累起来的资财，就继续这样花掉了。”
    例如：存在于生活中的各种浪费，斯大林说：“我们现在盛行宴会、各种节日、盛大会议、纪念典礼、纪念碑开幕等。这些‘事情’花了几万几十万的卢布。各种庆祝大会的发起人和盛大仪式的爱好者，在我们之间是很多的。半年、周年、二周年等等庆祝典礼，实在是惊人之多，要满足这种需要，真得有几千万卢布才行。”斯大林认为，这不是共产党人应有的铺张行为。对于这种铺张浪费，斯大林指出：“如果我们愿意切实节用我们的积累，以应我们工业之需要，那就应该展开坚决的斗争，以反对我们管理机关及我们生活中的铺张浪费。”
    “应该结束这种共产党人不应有的铺张行为”了。
    例如：对于盗窃行为，斯大林严格地揭露了当时存在的一种情况。“在这里更值得注意的，不是贼本人，而是这种事实，即周围的群众，明明知道贼，不仅不和他斗争，相反的，拍拍他的肩头，称赞他的巧妙，因之，贼在人们眼里成了一种英雄。”“这是值得注意的，这也是最危险的。”为什么这是值得注意和最危险的情形呢？斯大林解释说：“当捉住了一个敌探或叛徒的时候，群众的愤怒是没有界限的，都要求枪毙。而当贼在大家眼中活动，盗窃国家财物的时候，周围的群众却限于慈祥的微笑和拍肩称赞。”针对这种危险的情况，斯大林特别指出：“很明白的，盗窃人民财物，损害国民经济利益的贼，也是敌探及叛徒，要是不更坏的话。”像这样的贼，虽有国家机关加以逮捕，但斯大林认为，“这里需要另外的、更有效更严肃的办法。这种办法，就是在这些贼周围造成一般道德抵制及周围群众憎恨的气氛。”要使这些贼，在这种气氛里不能生活与存在。“消灭盗窃，乃是防护我们的积累，避免耗费的手段之一。”斯大林指出，必须和盗窃行为进行有系统的斗争。
    此外，斯大林还揭露了一种浪费，这就是，“如果不停止旷工，如果劳动生产率仍滞留在一点上而不提高，我们便不能向前推进我们的工业，便不能提高工资。”所以，必须向工人们讲清楚：“旷工和不向前推进劳动生产率，便是有害于共同的事业，有害于整个工人阶级，有害于我们的工业。”（以上所引均见斯大林著论苏联经济形势与党底政策）。
    以上许多严重的浪费现象，在列宁斯大林谆谆地教导下，在布尔什维克党的领导下，在苏联无产阶级坚决地对非无产阶级残余思想展开不懈的斗争下，迅速地被克服了，那种爱护和巩固公共财富，以及共产主义自觉的劳动态度，已成了苏联人民足以夸耀世界的高贵品质了。正因为苏联人民具有了这样的品质，他们便生气勃勃地献身于社会主义国家的建设，共产主义的建设。
    也正因为这样，在第二次世界大战后，敌人带给苏联人民的物质损失，虽达六千七百九十亿卢布之多，但苏联人民展开增产节约斗争的结果，一九四八年，就超过了这一年所规定的降低成本计划。由于工业品成本降低而获得超计划的价值，就有八十多亿卢布。这一年的生产水平，就超过战前一九四○年的百分之十八。到一九五○年，工业产量已超过战前一九四○年的百分之七十三。大大地超过了斯大林战后第一个五年计划超过战前一九四○年水平百分之四十八的要求了。一九五○年的农业总产量，也远超过战前的水平。由于物价四次减低的结果，苏联人民就得益达三千零十五亿卢布之多。苏联人民物质和文化的生活，也比战前提高。还大公无私地及时地给予人民民主国家珍贵的帮助。现在，苏联人民正在胜利地向共产主义迈进。
    战后五年计划的胜利完成，正是苏联人民在斯大林和苏联共产党领导和教育下，发挥了高度的积极性与创造性，艰苦奋斗，增产节约，辛勤劳动争取得来的一个辉煌的例证。
    苏联的现在，正是我们的未来。苏联人民的建国精神，正是我们学习的榜样。毛主席已在号召我们：“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军。”东北工人阶级已创立了增产节约粮食一千零四十万吨的良好先例，让我们在毛泽东的胜利旗帜下，学习苏联人民建国的先进经验，争取更大的胜利罢。（原载十一月十一日上海“解放日报”）
