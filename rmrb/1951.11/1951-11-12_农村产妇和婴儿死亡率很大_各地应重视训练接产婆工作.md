　　High Mortality Rates Among Rural Mothers and Infants: All Regions Should Emphasize Training Midwives

　　Editor: Recently, a tragic incident occurred in Yongxing Township, Huian District, Qidong County, Northern Jiangsu, where an old midwife caused the death of both a mother and her child. The incident unfolded as follows:

　　Fan Tianying, a 27-year-old resident of the township and wife of Chen Xilai, was pregnant and near her due date. On October 26th, she sought the services of Gao Yaxian, an old midwife in the township, for the delivery. Gao Yaxian began by using old methods like prescribing soil remedies to induce labor. After a long time, only one hand of the fetus emerged from the birth canal. Gao Yaxian declared, "This is a difficult birth; we can save the adult but not the child." She then proceeded to cut off the fetus's hand with a knife. The mother resisted, but Gao Yaxian still severed the hand. The fetus, in pain, retreated back inside. Gao Yaxian then reached into the mother's abdomen and pulled out all the child's heart and lungs. The mother immediately fainted. Someone was sent to the health clinic to fetch an obstetrician for emergency treatment, but it was ineffective. The mother, due to abdominal injuries and excessive blood loss, died the next day at noon.

　　After this case occurred, the Qidong County People's Court sent people to investigate. They determined that had the midwife not killed the fetus and instead sent the mother to the hospital's obstetrics department promptly, the mother would not have died under any circumstances. The court has accepted the public's opinion and will give the midwife Gao Yaxian the punishment she deserves.

　　This type of incident is not isolated in rural areas. According to incomplete statistics from Qidong County, between January and March 1950, 27 mothers and 106 infants died due to childbirth. What an alarming number this is! In order to protect the lives of mothers and infants, I believe that democratic women's federations, health departments, and children's welfare organizations at all levels should pay attention to this issue and find ways to gradually solve it. In areas where conditions permit, obstetrical hospitals should be established, more obstetrical schools should be opened, and obstetrical talent should be cultivated. Furthermore, old midwifery personnel in rural areas should be reformed, provided with scientific midwifery training, and those midwives who do not meet the requirements should be dissuaded from practicing.

　　农村产妇和婴儿死亡率很大
    各地应重视训练接产婆工作
    编辑同志：苏北启东县惠安区永兴乡最近发生了一件旧接产婆害死产妇母子的残酷事件。事件的经过是这样的：
    该乡居民陈锡来的妻子樊天英，年二十七岁，怀孕足月，于十月二十六日将近分娩时，便请该乡的旧接产婆高亚贤接生。高亚贤先用开土方等老一套办法催生。过了很久，胎儿从产门先出来一只手。高亚贤便说：“这是难产，保了大人，勿保小孩。”便要用刀割胎儿的手，产妇表示不愿，但高亚贤还是将胎儿的手割下。胎儿受痛，即回升上去。高亚贤又动手伸入产妇肚中将小孩心肺全部拉出。产妇当即晕厥。后来派人到卫生院请来产科医生急救无效，产妇因腹部受伤，流血过多，在第二天中午便死去了。
    此案发生后启东县人民法院派人前往检验，认为如接产婆不把胎儿弄死，及早送医院产科，则产妇无论如何也不会死亡。法院已接受群众的意见，将予接产婆高亚贤以应得的惩处。
    这种事件的发生，在农村中不是个别的现象。据启东县不完全的统计：在一九五○年一月至三月间因生育而死亡的产妇达二十七人，死亡的婴儿一百零六名。这是一个多么惊人的数字！为了保护母亲和婴儿的生命安全，我认为各级民主妇联、卫生部门和儿童福利组织应重视这个问题，并设法逐步解决这一问题。在有条件的地区应设立产科医院，多办产科学校，培养产科人材；并应改造农村中的旧接产人员，给予科学的接生训练，对不合条件的接产婆应劝止其接生。
