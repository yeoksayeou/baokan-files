    Transforming the People's Education Undertaking with Revolutionary Spirit and Revolutionary Methods
    Ma Dayou, Dean of the Engineering College of Peking University
    The 1952 Higher Industrial Education Departmental Adjustment Plan has been unanimously adopted at the National Conference of Deans of Engineering Colleges and has immediately received enthusiastic support from teachers at various schools. This is a major event in the history of education in our country. In this plan, the comprehensive adjustment of Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Yenching University is one of the key points. I feel especially honored and excited because of my close relationship with Peking University and Tsinghua University. We should make our greatest efforts to implement this plan well.
    The current Chinese higher industrial education is disconnected from the needs of national construction. This is primarily reflected in quantity. Vice Premier Guo Moruo of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council stated in his "Report on Cultural and Educational Work" at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "In five to six years, national economic construction will require approximately 150,000 senior technical and management cadres." This number is undoubtedly small compared to the situation in the Soviet Union, where this year alone, 250,000 people will graduate from higher industrial schools and be immediately qualified to serve as engineers. However, it far exceeds the current capacity of engineering colleges nationwide. Currently, there are over 33,000 students in engineering colleges across the country, and it takes four years to fully graduate. If we continue with the current methods, we probably won't even be able to supply 50,000 people in five years. In terms of quality, graduates from engineering colleges now cannot immediately assume the duties of engineers (because the school's training is seriously disconnected from the actual needs of national construction). Even the work of assistant engineers requires a considerable period of practical training before they can handle it. Therefore, the reform of higher industrial education is urgently needed; otherwise, national construction will be seriously affected.
    Education in old China was completely unplanned, with a state of anarchy prevailing everywhere. The establishment of schools was blind. Taking the Engineering College of Peking University as an example, in the past, some faculty members were dissatisfied with general engineering colleges, feeling that the management of engineering colleges needed reconsideration. However, Peking University's decision to add an engineering college in 1946 was mainly to follow the trend, without careful planning, and it was not developed after its establishment. Situations like this were not uncommon. Setting up departments, groups, and courses based on individuals was even more common, leading to extreme disarray. Small stalls were set up everywhere, most of which were not sound. Engineering colleges generally felt a shortage of teachers and equipment. Schools with weaker foundations could not offer many courses, and experiments could not be conducted. Even schools with good foundations felt that teachers were overburdened, had no time to improve their skills, and experimental equipment was inadequate. It was rare to find an engineering college in the country that could maintain its courses without difficulty, and almost none could conduct research work. Therefore, higher industrial education has always been limited to the transmission of engineering knowledge (more or less influenced by imperialist culture), unable to meet the requirements of industrial construction, and making almost no contribution to the improvement of industrial technology.
    There is a general feeling of insufficient teachers and equipment, but at the same time, there is a large amount of waste. Regardless of the size of the department, it must have a department head and an administrative organization. For example, many departments or groups have only ten or twenty students, so many teachers are practically lecturing to empty benches. I myself have a class with only ten students. If there were eighty or a hundred students, I could teach the same way. In fact, in a well-designed classroom, a class of one hundred students is not too many. The waste of equipment is even more alarming. Taking the Engineering College of Peking University as an example, the five sections of the mechanical workshop (lathe work, fitter work, woodworking, forging, and casting) can each accommodate forty students for practice simultaneously. If combined, they can accommodate two hundred students simultaneously. If used five days a week, with one day for repairs and preparation, ten classes can be opened in the morning and afternoon, providing practice for two thousand students. With the addition of some miscellaneous tools, this number could be greatly increased. But in fact, only sixty-one students are currently engaged in practice. This is just a striking example. We can say that almost none of the laboratories and workshops in engineering colleges across the country are fully utilized, with an average of no more than two or three afternoons per week. There is also a lot of experimental equipment that has not been used at all. For example, a school's high-voltage equipment, worth tens of millions of yuan, has not been used for several years because there is no time for research work. We don't know how much waste like this there is. This is the result of decentralization. Once teachers and equipment are dispersed, each place must have a set, so there is a feeling of insufficiency everywhere, and waste everywhere. The loss of work is even incalculable.
    Such unreasonable situations seriously affect the progress of higher industrial education and further restrict the progress of national construction. But why couldn't adjustments be made earlier? At the higher education conference last summer vacation and in the discussions on the key development of engineering colleges this spring, some people mentioned the necessity of adjusting the departments, but ideological concerns prevented us from realistically considering this issue. Some teachers felt that their schools were perfect, while others were full of shortcomings, and that mixing them would affect the gold-lettered signboard of their own school. Therefore, when discussing whether it would be beneficial to merge departments, one department head said: "Our houses there are already too full." The implication was that they would never welcome others to adjust in, and as for adjusting his department to another school, he had not even considered it. This was a more prominent case. The general opinion was that adjusting in could be considered, but adjusting out was firmly opposed. Therefore, someone suggested that the government should generously raise funds to build a perfect new university so that everyone could move in together and everyone would be happy. Personal considerations were even more numerous: After the adjustment, will I still be able to be the dean or department head? Will the courses I am good at still be taught by me? Is another professor who is more accomplished in this area going to steal my "rice bowl"? My skills are a bit lacking, and I can barely cope now, but will it become a problem after the adjustment? Some people suspect that the other party has sectarian tendencies: Will I be adjusted to Tsinghua University this year and then to Shanxi next year? Moving is too troublesome, who will take care of the expenses? What if it's inconvenient? Can I be assigned to a good house? What about the work and study of my spouse and children? This series of questions were kept bottled up in their hearts, but what they said was about funding issues, housing issues, international impact issues (will the Americans use the adjustment as an excuse to attack us for not having academic freedom?) and the ideological problems of "others."
    The fact that this adjustment plan has received unanimous support from all parties proves that the understanding of teachers in engineering colleges across the country has generally improved, and they can indeed put the interests of the country and the people first. This is a very gratifying new phenomenon. Under the strong leadership of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, and through the efforts of all teachers, the successful completion of the adjustment work is inevitable. When carrying out the work, we must also be vigilant. Although teachers in higher education institutions have greatly improved their understanding after more than two years of study, especially the ongoing ideological remolding movement, have the sectarianism, departmentalism, and individualism mentioned above been completely overcome? I dare say they have not. I heard that before the meeting of deans, one dean was instructed by an old professor in the college: "You must fight for us at the meeting, this is a matter of our life and death!" The problem is whether this dean, who did not "fight" at the meeting, will be able to explain himself well upon returning. In a sense, this adjustment is indeed a matter of our life and death – both for higher education itself and for national construction. Therefore, we must strive to overcome bad ideological consciousness and strive for the success of the adjustment. Only with the successful completion of the adjustment can we concentrate manpower and material resources and greatly develop them to complete the task of cultivating a large number of industrial cadres. In addition, earnestly implementing the educational policy of combining long-term training with short-term training, greatly increasing specialized courses, and changing teaching content and methods to closely integrate with the actual needs of national construction are all still important tasks in reforming higher industrial education. We must work harder to complete them. Therefore, the tasks before us are still very arduous. Only when the political understanding of all teachers in engineering colleges is further improved, the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly is truly established, and all ideological shortcomings are overcome, can the task of reforming higher industrial education be successfully completed. We must strive for the future of the people's education undertaking.

    用革命的精神、革命的办法改造人民教育事业
    北京大学工学院院长  马大猷
    一九五二年高等工业教育院系调整方案已在全国工学院院长会议上一致通过，并且立刻得到各校教员的热烈拥护。这在我国教育史上是一件大事。在这个方案里，北京大学、清华大学和燕京大学三校的全面调整是重点之一，我因为和北京大学及清华大学都有密切关系，尤其觉得荣幸和兴奋。我们应该用最大努力，使这个方案很好地实施。
    目前的中国高等工业教育是与祖国建设的需要脱节的，这一点首先表现在数量上。中央人民政府政务院郭沫若副总理在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议上“关于文化教育工作的报告”中说：“在五六年内，全国经济建设约需高级技术干部和管理干部十五万人左右。”这个数目，如果和苏联仅是今年就有二十五万人自高等工业学校毕业并且可以立刻担任工程师职务的情况相比当然是太小了，但是却远超过全国工学院在目前情况下的能力所及。现在全国工学院的学生共为三万三千多人，四年才能完全毕业，如果按现在的方法办下去，五年中恐怕连五万人都供应不出。在质量上，现在工学院毕业的学生不但不能立刻担任工程师的职务（因为学校的训练与祖国建设的实际严重地脱节的缘故），就是助理工程师的工作也必须经过相当时间的实习后才能够担负起来。因此高等工业教育的改革是刻不容缓的，否则国家建设就要受到严重的影响。
    旧中国的教育是完全无计划的，处处存在无政府状态。学校的设置是盲目的。以北京大学工学院为例，过去有一部分教员对一般工学院不满意，觉得工学院的办理有重新考虑的必要；但是一九四六年北京大学决定加设工学院，主要是为了趋时髦，并没有周密的计划，开办后也没有加以发展。像这样情形的并不在少数，因人设系，因人设组，因人设课的更多，因此情形非常紊乱，一个一个小摊子，大部分都不够健全。各工学院普遍地感觉师资和设备的不足。基础差一点的学校有很多课程开不出，实验不能作；基础好的学校也感觉教师负担重，没有时间进修以提高业务，实验设备也不凑手。在全国工学院中能维持课程而不发生困难的是很难得的，能进行研究工作的几乎没有。因此高等工业教育一直是停留在工程知识（或多或少地受帝国主义文化影响的）的传授，既不能满足工业建设的要求，对工业技术的改进也几乎是毫无贡献。
    师资和设备普遍地感觉不够，但同时又大量地浪费着。系不管大小要设一个系主任和一套行政组织。例如很多系或组只有十个二十个学生，因此不少教师几乎是对着空板凳讲书的。我自己就有一班课只有十个同学，如果有八十个或一百个同学我还是可以一样的教，事实上，在设计优良的教室里一百个同学一班也不算多。设备的浪费更是惊人了。以北京大学工学院而论，机械实习工厂的五个部分（车工、钳工、木工、锻工、铸工）都可以同时容四十人实习，如加起来同时就可以有二百人实习，如果每周使用五天，留一天作修理准备工作，上下午就可以开十班，供二千同学实习。再补充一些零星工具，这个数目还可以大大增加。但事实上，现在进行实习的同学只有六十一人。这不过是一个显著的例子罢了。我们可以说，全国工学院的实验室和实习工厂几乎没有一个是充分利用着的，平均每周最多用两三个下午。实验设备根本未加动用的也不少，例如某校价值几万万元的高压设备，因为没有时间作研究工作，几年都没有用过。像这样的浪费还不知道有多少。这就是分散的结果。师资和设备一分散，每处都要有一套，因此就处处感觉不够，而又处处浪费。工作的损失，更无法计算了。
    像这样不合理的情况，严重地影响着高等工业教育的进步，更限制了国家建设的进行。但是为什么不能早一点进行调整呢？在去年暑假中的高等教育会议上和今年春天工学院重点发展的讨论里，都有人提到院系有加以调整的必要，但是思想上的顾虑使我们无法实事求是地对这个问题加以考虑。有些教师觉得自己的学校是尽善尽美的，别人处处是缺点，混起来就要影响自己学校的金字招牌。因此有一位系主任在讨论系的合并有没有好处时，就说：“我们那里的房子已经太满了。”意思是说，决不欢迎别人调整进来，至于把他的系调整到别校，就根本没有想过。这是比较突出的，一般的意见还是调整进来是可以考虑的，调整出去就坚决反对。因此就有人建议，请政府宽筹经费，建一个尽善尽美的新大学，以便大家一起搬进去，皆大欢喜。个人的考虑就更多了：调整后，我的院长、系主任还做得成不？我拿手的课程是不是还由我教？另外一位在这方面比我更有成就的教授是不是要把我的“饭碗”抢去？我的业务差一点，现在可以勉强对付，调整后是不是就要成问题？有的人怀疑对方有宗派主义的倾向：是不是今年把我调整到清华大学，明年就要把我调整到山西了？搬家太麻烦，费用谁管？不便利了怎么办？是不是可以分派到一所好房子？爱人、儿女的工作和学习怎么办？这一连串的问题都闷在肚子里，口里说的却是经费问题，房舍问题，国际影响问题（美国人是不是要用调整作借口，攻击我们没有学术自由？）以及“别人的”思想问题。
    这次的调整方案能得到各方面的一致拥护，证明全国工学院教师的认识已普遍地有了进步，确能把国家的利益和人民的利益放在前面，这是一个非常可喜的新气象。在中央人民政府教育部的大力领导下，通过全体教师们的努力，调整工作的胜利成功是必然的。在进行工作时，我们也必须警惕，虽然高等学校教师们经过两年多的学习，尤其是最近正在进行中的改造思想学习运动，认识都已大大地提高了，但是上面所说的一些宗派主义、本位主义和个人主义的想法是不是完全克服了呢？我敢说是没有的。听说院长会议开会前有一位院长就受到院中老教授的嘱托：“你要在会上替我们争一争，这是我们的生死存亡关头！”这位院长没有在会上“争”，回去是不是好交代还是问题。这次调整在某种意义上的确是我们的生死存亡关头——就高等教育本身、就国家建设来说都是如此。所以，我们必须努力克服不良思想意识，争取调整的成功。只有调整的胜利成功，我们才有可能集中人力、物力并且大大地加以发挥，完成培养大量工业干部的任务。此外，切实执行长期培养与短期训练相结合的教育政策，大量举办专修科以及改变教学内容、方法与祖国建设实际密切地结合起来，都还是改革高等工业教育中的重要工作。必须更加努力地完成。因此我们面前的任务还是非常艰巨的，只有在工学院全体教师的政治认识进一步提高，确实地建立起全心全意为人民服务的观点并克服思想上的一切缺点时，改革高等工业教育的任务才有可能顺利地完成。我们要为人民教育事业的前途而奋斗。
