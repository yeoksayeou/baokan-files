    China National Committee for the Defense of Children
    Telegram to the Women's International Democratic Federation

    Dear Mrs. Gordon of the Women's International Democratic Federation:

    In order to implement the resolution of the Berlin meeting of the Council of the Women's International Democratic Federation on strengthening and expanding the movement to defend children, we have established the China National Committee for the Defense of Children today. We want to unite the mothers, youth, educators, scientists, writers, medical and health workers, child workers, relief and welfare workers, religious figures, and all people and organizations who care for children across the country to jointly oppose imperialist wars of aggression, defend world peace, and promote children's welfare; and join hands with all peace-loving and democratic people around the world to fight for the defense of world peace and the rights of children.

    We are pleased to hear that the Berlin Executive Committee will discuss the preparation work for the International Conference for the Defense of Children, and we wish the conference success!

        Song Qingling, Chairman of the China National Committee for the Defense of Children
                    November 26, 1951
