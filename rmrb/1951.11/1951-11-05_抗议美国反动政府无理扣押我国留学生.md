    Protest Against the Unreasonable Detention of Our Students by the Reactionary American Government
    To the Editor: After reading the news in the People's Daily on October 23rd about our students in the United States being unreasonably detained by the American government on their way back to China, I felt boundless indignation. What crime is it for our students to want to return to the embrace of their motherland? The reactionary American government is utterly shameless!
    Recalling my own experience of returning to China from the United States last year, I also encountered various unreasonable obstructions and interferences from the reactionary American government and the British Consulate in New York. The imperialist reactionaries invariably try every possible means to obstruct Chinese students who want to return to their motherland, and create all kinds of rumors, saying that students will be hanged and trained after returning to China, and so on. The yellow newspapers of American capitalists are constantly touting their "freedom" and the foul so-called "American way of life." It turns out that fabricating rumors is their "freedom," and detaining students from other countries is their "way of life"!
    As a scientist, I want to lodge a firm protest against the barbaric and unreasonable despicable tactics of American imperialism!

    抗议美国反动政府无理扣押我国留学生
    编辑同志：我看了十月二十三日人民日报登载的我国留美学生在返国途中被美国政府无理扣押的消息后，感到无限的愤慨。我国的留学生要投向祖国的怀抱，这有什么罪过？美国反动政府竟横蛮无耻到这等地步！
    回想我去年由美国动身回国的时候，也曾遭到美国反动政府与英国驻纽约领事馆的种种无理留难与干涉。帝国主义反动派对于要回祖国的我国留学生，无不千方百计地加以留难，并且制造种种谣言，说什么留学生回国后要受绞刑和训练等等。美国资本家的黄色报纸天天在吹嘘它们的“自由”和腐臭不堪的所谓“美国生活方式”，原来造谣诽谤就是它们的“自由”，扣押别国留学生就是它们的
    “生活方式”！
    我是一个科学工作者，对于美帝国主义这种横蛮无理的卑劣手段，我要提出坚决的抗议！
