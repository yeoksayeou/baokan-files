Patriotic Artist Chang Xiangyu

In the patriotic donation movement, Chang Xiangyu, a famous Henan Opera actress, and her Xiangyu Opera Troupe, decided to conduct a six-month tour of charity performances in major cities across the country, donating the performance income to purchase a fighter plane.

Donating a fighter plane is a glorious and arduous task. Some artists said to Chang Xiangyu: "Why bother? If you sacrifice like this now, who will care if you go hungry in the future?" Her answer was firm: "In the new China, you don't have to worry about going hungry anymore. It is precisely for the new China that I am determined to donate more." So, she sold her children's gold locks and jewelry, sold her car, and first personally donated 40 million yuan. She also used the remaining money as the troupe's fund to supplement what the troupe needed for the charity performances. For the convenience of the journey, she entrusted her three children to the Xi'an Nursery, and would meet them again after completing the mission. Her patriotic enthusiasm greatly encouraged all the actors in the troupe. When she told all the comrades in the troupe about the charity performance proposal, the actors said: "Who wouldn't be happy to be patriotic?" Now the Xiangyu Opera Troupe is touring charity performances in various places and has been warmly welcomed by the people. In Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, and Xinxiang alone, the performances have completed a donation of more than 500 million yuan.

Why is the patriotic enthusiasm of Chang Xiangyu and all the actors of the Xiangyu Opera Troupe so high? Chang Xiangyu's own history answers this question. In old China, Chang Xiangyu, like many artists, suffered all kinds of oppression and insults from warlords and bureaucrats. When Chang Xiangyu was fourteen years old, she was performing in Kaifeng. Her father "offended" a "high official" of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and this guy sent people to smash the theater. Therefore, Chang Xiangyu dared not stay in Kaifeng and fled to Weishi County in tears. Who knew that when she arrived there, she encountered a Kuomintang bandit army's Huang Division Commander, who already had three concubines. Seeing that Chang Xiangyu sang well, he sent someone to tell her that he wanted her to be his concubine. Chang Xiangyu scolded him. At night, while she was performing, the robbers threw two grenades at her, resulting in the injury of several audience members. Chang Xiangyu was forced to leave Weishi County again. Later, in Zhengzhou, in Xi'an, and in Lanzhou, Chang Xiangyu was unable to live a single day in peace. Old China was grinding down our artists like this, grinding down Chang Xiangyu.

However, in the new China, Chang Xiangyu is living a new life. After the liberation of Lanzhou in 1949, she returned to Lanzhou to perform. Her theater was filled with a prosperous and joyful scene. With the help of comrades engaged in drama reform and comrades from the Art Institute, she rehearsed new plays. She began to feel that society had really changed. After some time, she became a representative of the Northwest District Literary and Art Workers Congress and was honorably elected as a member of the Northwest Federation of Literary and Art Circles. When she first went to Xi'an to attend the conference, she was a little scared in her heart, wondering what would happen when she went, so she asked her husband to accompany her. At the meeting, the comrades treated Chang Xiangyu like brothers and sisters. She was illiterate, so the comrades read to her, wrote for her, and also encouraged her to study culture, which deeply moved Chang Xiangyu. With the help of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Chang Xiangyu immediately rehearsed new plays such as "Ruji Stealing the Talisman," "New Hua Mulan," and "Shao Qiaoyun" after returning to Lanzhou. She melted the excellent tunes of Qinqiang, ZhuiZi, Daggu, and even Yue Opera into her own lyrics, making the emotions of Henan Opera richer. Chang Xiangyu herself said: "When I go on stage to sing, because I am happy in my heart, I can bring out all my strengths." Her active efforts in the work of opera reform have won the warm welcome of the broad masses of the audience. She was later successively elected as a representative of the Northwest District Women's Congress and a representative of the People's Congress of all circles in Gansu Province.

In April and May of this year, various places vigorously suppressed counter-revolutionaries. Ye Xinfu, the big secret agent leader in Xi'an, had insulted many actresses in the past, and was arrested this time. On the day of the public trial, Chang Xiangyu also took the stage to accuse him. In June, after listening to the report of the returning representatives of the Volunteer Army in Xi'an, she heard that they were fighting in the freezing cold, and some soldiers' feet were frozen, but they still insisted on chasing and killing the enemy. Soon, the Xiangyu Opera Troupe went to a hospital to perform a consolation performance. In the days after returning home, Chang Xiangyu kept thinking about the wounded comrades, thinking about the Volunteer Army on the Korean front, and thinking about the happy days now. The more she thought about it, the more she felt that the Volunteer Army was great. She immediately discussed with her husband how to contribute more to the country. Chang Xiangyu and her husband Xian Zhang discussed it and decided to lead the troupe to perform charity performances and donate a fighter plane to support the most beloved people.

    爱国艺人常香玉
    在爱国捐献运动中，河南梆子戏著名演员常香玉和她领导的香玉剧社，决定在全国各大城市巡回义演六个月，拿演出收入捐献战斗机一架。
    捐献战斗机一架，是一件光荣的、艰巨的事。有个别艺人对常香玉说：“何苦呢？现在你这样牺牲，将来饿饭谁管呢？”她的回答是坚定的：“在新中国你再也不必耽心饿饭，正是为了新中国，我决心要多多捐献。”于是，她变卖了孩子们的金锁和首饰，变卖了自己的汽车，首先个人捐献了四千万元，还把余下的钱作为剧社的基金，补充了社内义演时所需要的东西。为了旅途上的方便，她又把三个孩子寄托给西安市保育院，等完成任务回来后，再和孩子们见面。她的爱国热情，大大鼓舞了剧社全体演员。当她把义演的提议告诉剧社内全体同志时，演员们说：“爱国，谁还不乐意。”现在香玉剧社正在各地巡回义演，受到了各地人民的热烈欢迎。仅在开封、郑州、新乡三地演出，就完成了捐献数字五亿余元。
    常香玉和香玉剧社的全体演员们的爱国热情为什么这样高呢？常香玉自己的历史回答了这个问题。在旧中国，常香玉和许多艺人一样，受尽了军阀官僚们的种种压迫和侮辱。常香玉十四岁那一年在开封演出，她父亲“得罪”了国民党反动派的一个“官长”，这个家伙就派人去砸戏园子，于是，常香玉不敢在开封停留了，饮泣吞声逃到尉氏县。谁知到了那里，又碰上一个国民党匪军的黄师长，他已经有了三个小老婆，见常香玉戏唱得好，打发人来传话，要常香玉做他的小老婆，常香玉骂了他一顿。晚上，正在演戏时，强盗们向着她连扔两个手榴弹，结果炸伤了几个观众，常香玉又被迫离开尉氏县。后来，在郑州，在西安，在兰州，常香玉没有能过一天安静日子。旧中国就是这样磨折着我们的艺人，磨折着常香玉。
    但是，在新中国，常香玉过着一种崭新的生活。一九四九年兰州解放后，她回到兰州演戏。他的戏园充满了一片兴盛和快乐的景象。她在从事戏剧改革工作的同志和艺术学院的同志们帮助之下排了新戏。她开始感觉到，社会是真变了。过了些日子，她当了西北区文学艺术工作者代表会议的代表，并光荣地当选为西北文联委员。当她第一次赴西安参加大会的时候，心里还有点害怕，不知去了会怎么样，就让她的丈夫陪她去。到了会上，同志们待常香玉像兄弟姊妹一样。她不认识字，同志们念给她听，代她写，还劝她学文化，这使常香玉深为感动。常香玉在文联的帮助之下，回兰州后马上排了“如姬窃符”、“新花木兰”、“邵巧云”等新戏。她把秦腔、坠子、大鼓以至越剧的优良曲调，融化在自己的唱词里，使河南梆子戏的感情更加丰富起来。常香玉自己这样说：“当我上台演唱时，因为心眼里高兴，便什么优点都发挥出来了。”她对戏曲改革工作的积极努力，获得了广大观众的热烈欢迎。她后来又先后当选为西北区妇女代表会议代表、甘肃省各界人民代表会议代表。
    今年四五月间，各地大张旗鼓镇压反革命。西安大特务头子叶新甫，过去污辱过很多女演员，这次被逮捕了。开公审大会的那天，常香玉也走上主席台控诉。六月间，在西安听了志愿军归国代表的报告，听说他们在冰天雪地里作战，有些战士脚冻坏了，还坚持追杀敌人。不久，香玉剧社到某地医院作慰问演出。回家后的几天里，常香玉不断想起伤员同志，想起朝鲜前线的志愿军，又想到现在的幸福的日子，越想越觉得志愿军伟大。她当下就和她的丈夫商量，怎样才能为国家多贡献出一分力量。常香玉和她的丈夫宪章合计了一下，决心带领剧社去义演，捐献战斗机一架，支援最可爱的人。（鹤）（附图片）
