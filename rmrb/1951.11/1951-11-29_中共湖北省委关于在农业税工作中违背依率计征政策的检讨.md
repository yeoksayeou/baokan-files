To the People's Daily:

The criticism you made in the Economic Work Review on page two of the People's Daily on November 6th, "In Agricultural Tax Work, We Must Adhere to the Policy of Tax Calculation Based on Fixed Rates," is entirely correct. We are now submitting the following self-criticism regarding the reasons why we made this error and our errors in understanding:

Regarding this year's agricultural tax work, the Provincial People's Government of Hubei held a special discussion at the joint meeting of finance section chiefs and commissioners and county heads in early August, based on the instructions of the Government Administration Council. It was decided that in areas where land reform had been carried out, land surveys and output assessments would be conducted at the county or district level, and taxes would be calculated based on fixed rates, without assigning tasks to the townships. In areas with a weak work foundation, a combination of land surveys and output assessments, task assignments, and tax calculation based on fixed rates would be adopted. A plan was formulated to ensure that land acreage would be verified in most areas throughout the province next year (in conjunction with land reform review and issuance of land certificates), output would be assessed, and tax calculation based on fixed rates would be implemented to fix the burden, so as to encourage the enthusiasm of the people in production. However, only half of our province had undergone land reform and had not been reviewed; the other half had only undergone rent reduction and anti-hegemony campaigns. At this time, landlord counter-attacks and sabotage incidents occurred relatively commonly throughout the province, and cadres and the masses developed complacency and a desire to "retreat." We were deeply concerned that the movement would be interrupted and the work would "relapse." Therefore, we proposed conducting a review in areas where land reform had been carried out and carrying out land reform pilot projects and anti-hegemony campaigns in areas where land reform had not been carried out, in order to defeat landlord counter-attacks. However, we were also concerned that land surveys and output assessments would take too long, delaying the autumn tax collection and hindering the land reform work after the autumn harvest. Therefore, we attempted to adopt a simpler method to complete the autumn tax collection task in a shorter period. Consequently, on August 28th, we hastily issued instructions on agricultural tax collection work, emphasizing the completion of assigned tasks, without complying with the central government's unified policy of tax calculation based on fixed rates.

We also noted that in previous years, when assigning autumn tax collection tasks, many counties, districts, and even townships, under the pretext of fearing failure to complete the task, deliberately increased the normal yield per mu and added public grain quotas at each level. In order to prevent lower levels from increasing the burden on farmers, we indiscriminately and erroneously equated "tax calculation based on fixed rates" with "seizing farmers' excessive burden," leading various circles to misunderstand that we were resisting the central government's policy of tax calculation based on fixed rates.

We fully support the correct policy of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government regarding tax calculation based on fixed rates. The demand of farmers after the land reform review is to verify land acreage and fix the burden. Only by meeting this demand of the farmers can we stabilize the production sentiments of all classes and improve their enthusiasm for production. However, we neither fully reflected the situation below nor hastily issued instructions that violated the central policy. This is our disorganized and undisciplined erroneous behavior. The ideological source of this error is that we did not sufficiently recognize the importance of agricultural tax work. Therefore, the People's Daily's severe criticism of our province is entirely correct, and it has given us a serious education.

The Hubei Daily editorial was written based on the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, so we are responsible for its errors.

We have made a self-criticism to the Central China Bureau Committee of the CCP regarding the above errors and have requested punishment.

The conditions for implementing land surveys and output assessments and implementing the policy of tax calculation based on fixed rates are gradually being met in our province, and we will resolutely implement them in the future.

### 中共湖北省委关于在农业税工作中违背依率计征政策的检讨

    中共湖北省委关于在农业税工作中违背依率计征政策的检讨人民日报社：
    人民日报十一月六日二版经济工作简评“在农业税工作中必须坚持依率计征的方针”一文中对我们提出的批评是完全正确的。特将我们所以产生此种错误的原因和我们认识上的错误作如下检讨：
    关于今年农业税工作，本省人民政府在八月初先后在财政科长与专员县长联席会议上根据政务院的指示作了专门讨论，确定在已进行土地改革的地区以县或区为单位进行查田定产，实行依率计征，不往乡分派任务；工作基础薄弱之区则采取查田评产、分配任务与依率计征相结合的作法。并制定计划，确定全省于明年内在大部地区查实田亩（结合土地改革复查、发土地证工作进行），进行评定产量，实现依率计征，固定负担，以便鼓励人民群众生产的积极性；但我省只有一半地区进行了土地改革，尚未复查；一半地区只是减租反霸。此时全省又较普遍地发生了地主反攻破坏事件，干部及群众又滋长着自满“退坡”情绪，我们深恐运动中断，工作“回生”；所以提出在土地改革地区进行复查，未进行土地改革的地区则进行土地改革的试点工作，并进行反霸，以打退地主反攻。但又顾虑查田定产费时过久，秋征拖延时日，耽误了秋后的土地改革工作；因而企图采取比较简易的办法，争取于较短时间之内完成秋征任务。遂于八月二十八日草率发出关于农业税征收工作的指示，强调完成分派任务，未遵照中央依率计征的统一政策。
    我们又鉴于历年分派秋征任务时，有不少县、区以至于乡藉口怕完不成任务，而发生故意提高田亩常年产量，层层加派公粮数目的现象；为防止下边加重农民负担，竟不加区别，错误地把“依率计征”与“夺取农民超额负担”相提并论，致使各界误解我们抵抗中央人民政府依率计征的方针。
    我们完全拥护中央人民政府政务院关于依率计征的正确方针。土地改革复查以后的农民的要求是查实田亩，固定负担，也只有满足农民的这种要求，才能稳定各阶层的生产情绪，提高其生产的积极性。然而我们既没有详细反映下面情况，又轻易草率发出违背中央政策的指示，这是我们无组织无纪律的错误行为。这种错误的思想来源，是我们对农业税工作的重要性认识不足。为此，人民日报提出对我省的严厉批评，这是完全正确的，这给了我们以严正的教育。
    湖北日报社论系根据省委指示写的，因而其错误由我们负责。
    上述错误已向中共中央中南局委员会作过检讨，并请求给予处分。
    实行查田定产贯彻依率计征的方针，本省条件已逐渐具备，今后必坚决贯彻之。
   中共湖北省委员会
