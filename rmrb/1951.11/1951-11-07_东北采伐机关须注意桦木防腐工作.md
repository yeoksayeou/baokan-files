    Northeast Logging Agencies Must Pay Attention to Birch Wood Preservation

    Birch wood has a fine texture, suitable for making farm tools and furniture, and is also a suitable material for manufacturing yarn tubes for textiles. This kind of wood is produced in large quantities in Northeast China, and in small quantities in some areas within the customs (关内, i.e., the area inside the Great Wall). Tianjin is closer to the birch wood production area in Northeast China than other cities within the customs, and the transportation is convenient. However, most of the materials we use to manufacture yarn tubes are transported from Zhejiang, Fujian, and Jiangxi, and a small portion from Shanxi and Chahar. This unreasonable situation undoubtedly wastes manpower and material resources. The reason for this situation is that the birch trunks produced in Northeast China are large, and there are no roads in the forest area, so they cannot be transported. After being felled, they must wait for heavy rains in the rainy season to wash them out. If there is no heavy rain, they will be piled up in the production area and cannot be dehydrated and dried. After the high temperature and humidity of summer, they will rot. Even if they can be transported out immediately after being felled, they cannot be sawn open one by one due to the lack of drying equipment. Thus, the wet wood with bark will rot if it is not used in the same year. Birch wood is also produced in the Qinling Mountains of Shaanxi. The developers fell it, saw it into boards, and transport it out in the same year, so there is no decay phenomenon. However, the birch wood in Northeast China is only decayed because it cannot be dried in time after being felled. This is a great loss of national resources. I suggest that the relevant logging agencies in Northeast China pay attention to this matter and transport and dry the birch wood felled in the current year in the same year, or inject preservatives such as creosote oil (produced in Fushun in large quantities), copper sulfate, zinc chloride, etc., immediately after felling. Only in this way can birch wood be durable.

    东北采伐机关须注意桦木防腐工作
    桦木木质细致，适宜于制造农具、家具，也是制造纺织用的纱管的合适材料。这种木料东北出产很多，关内部分地区也有出产，但为数少。天津距离东北桦木产区较关内其他城市近，交通也方便，然而我们制造纱管的材料大部依靠浙江、福建、江西运来，小部分依靠山西、察哈尔运来。这个不合理的现象无疑地是浪费人力物力的。所以有这样的情形，是因为东北出产的桦木躯干大，林区无路，不能运输，伐倒后须待雨季下大雨冲出，若无大雨，就堆积在产区，不能脱水干燥，经过夏天高温高湿即行腐朽。即使伐倒后能马上运出，但因缺乏干燥设备，又不能一一锯开，这样带皮湿木，当年不使用也要腐朽。陕西秦岭亦产桦木，开采者都是把它伐倒锯板，于当年运出，所以没有腐朽现象。而东北的桦木，却仅因伐倒后不能及时使之干燥而腐朽，这是国家资材的莫大损失。我建议东北有关采伐机关注意这件事，将当年伐倒的桦木，在当年运出当年干燥，或在伐倒后即行注射防腐药品如防腐油（抚顺出产很多），硫酸铜、氯化锌等，这样才能使桦木持久耐用。
