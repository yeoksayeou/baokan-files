    All Employees of Tangshan Electric Power Bureau and Tangshan Power Plant
    November 7, 1951
    [Xinhua News Agency, 17th] In order to respond to Chairman Mao's call at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference for increasing production and practicing thrift, all employees of the Tangshan Electric Power Bureau and Tangshan Power Plant wrote a letter to Chairman Mao on the 7th of this month, reporting their plan to launch a production increase and thrift movement, guaranteeing to increase production and save 500 tons of millet for the country in the fourth quarter of this year; and are willing to launch a patriotic production increase and thrift competition with employees across the country.
    In the patriotic safety and coal-saving competition between factories of the North China and East China Electric Power Bureaus, which began in November last year, the Tangshan Electric Power Bureau and Tangshan Power Plant have won three consecutive victories. On October 24 this year, after hearing Chairman Mao's opening remarks at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the employees of the Tangshan Electric Power Bureau and Power Plant immediately launched a discussion. At that time, some employees believed that the electric power industry could only focus on safety and coal saving, and that increasing production would be futile if the extra electricity could not be used. The CPC Committee of the Tangshan Electric Power Bureau and Power Plant, in response to this idea, convened a meeting of party member cadres, raised specific production issues such as whether the power outage time during maintenance was too long, and whether employees could be mobilized to turn waste materials into useful things, and asked everyone to discuss them. After discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that the power outage time during maintenance was indeed too long due to simply paying attention to safety, and also unanimously agreed that as long as the masses of workers were mobilized, there would be a way to turn waste materials into useful things. This eliminated the idea of some party member cadres that production could not be increased. Subsequently, the CPC party organizations, trade unions, and Communist Youth League organizations mobilized party members, league members, and all trade union members respectively. The Electric Power Bureau also convened an enlarged meeting of bureau affairs cadres for discussion. At these meetings, everyone reviewed that the reason why they thought there was no way to increase production in the past was mainly due to conservative thinking and complacency; at the same time, they researched many specific ways to increase production and save money. For example, coal-saving model Li Xiujun proposed that coal consumption could be reduced from 0.58 kg per kilowatt-hour to 0.577 kg. Engineer Zhao Weizhou of the power plant and others proposed that the small maintenance time in December could be shortened by one day, increasing millet production for the country by 10,000 kg. Cao Hongquan, an overhead linesman, and technician Wang Weide of the Electric Power Bureau, proposed that the use of transformers was wasteful and that 200 to 300 kVA of capacity could be withdrawn. When various workshops and groups were discussing and formulating specific plans for increasing production and saving money, they held multiple workshop and group meetings. The workers further came up with many ideas, such as the coal consumption standard being further reduced from the original savings plan of 0.577 kg to 0.568 kg after specific discussions by the workers, so that 401 tons of coal could be saved for the country in two months. The use of transformers has also increased from the original plan to withdraw 200 to 300 kVA of capacity to 600 kVA of capacity. By October 27, the planned increase in production value by all employees of the Electric Power Bureau and Power Plant had reached more than 1 billion yuan, and the savings value had reached more than 96 million yuan. On the 7th of this month, a general meeting of all employees was convened, and it was unanimously guaranteed that in the fourth quarter, wealth worth 500 tons of millet would be increased and saved for the country. The meeting passed a letter to Chairman Mao, guaranteeing to complete this task and prepare for the 1952 production increase and thrift plan. All employees also expressed their willingness to launch a patriotic production increase and thrift competition with employees across the country. The production increase and thrift movement of the Tangshan Electric Power Bureau and Tangshan Power Plant has now been enthusiastically launched.

    给毛主席写信响应增产节约号召
    保证第四季度增产节约五百吨粮食
    并愿和全国职工进行增产节约竞赛
    【新华社十七日讯】唐山电业局和唐山发电厂全体职工写信给毛主席，保证今年第四季度开展增产节约运动，为国家增产节约五百吨粮食。该信全文如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    为了响应您在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议上“需要继续加强抗美援朝的工作，需要增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的号召，建设伟大祖国，保卫世界和平，我们唐山电业局和唐山发电厂全体职工，已经认真地学习了您的指示，并决定在过去安全、省煤的爱国主义厂际竞赛已获得多次优胜的基础上，大规模地开展爱国增产、巩固安全、厉行节约的运动，来实现您的号召。我们保证作到：
    一、第四季度除完成国家任务外，在缩短检修时间增加发电量、节约原材料降低消耗定额（每度电的煤耗达到○·五六八公斤，厂用电率达到百分之三点八）、发挥设备潜在能力等方面，保证给国家增加财富五百吨小米。
    二、继续巩固安全发电送电，坚决遵守操作规程和生产制度，认真学习苏联先进经验，提高技术水平；在发电系统方面彻底消灭重要事故。
    三、加强经营管理。在今年年底前作好清理资产核定资金的工作；设备利用率由定额百分之四十二提高到百分之四十八。
    四、继续加强抗美援朝的爱国主义教育，认真学习毛泽东思想，提高政治思想水平，保证每周有四小时政治时事学习；努力培养学徒，争取在今后一年内将现有学徒、教育场的学员共一百名培养为技工。
    五、加强整体观点，在共产党、政府、工会的领导下，做好调整负荷合理用电的工作；并主动帮助私营自备电厂，以充分发挥人民电业的潜在能力。
    敬爱的毛主席：我们一定做好以上各项工作，并且还要做好一九五二年进一步增产节约的准备工作，为国家增产节约更多的财富，支援人民志愿军，巩固国防。我们相信电业职工和全国职工们，一定会和我们一起，热烈展开爱国主义的增产节约竞赛，使全国迅速出现一个普遍高涨的爱国增产节约运动。
    敬祝您身体健康唐山电业局唐山发电厂全体职工一九五一年十一月七日
    【新华社十七日讯】唐山电业局和唐山发电厂全体职工，为响应毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议上提出的关于增产节约的号召，于本月七日写信给毛主席，报告他们开展增产节约运动的计划，保证要在今年第四季度内为国家增产节约五百吨小米；并愿和全国职工一道展开爱国主义的增产节约竞赛。
    在去年十一月开始的华北、华东电业局厂际爱国主义的安全、省煤竞赛中，唐山电业局和唐山发电厂曾连续得到三次优胜。今年十月二十四日，唐山电业局和电厂职工听到毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议上的开会词后，立即展开讨论。当时部分职工曾认为电业中只能搞安全、省煤，无法增产，认为发的电多外面用不了也是枉然。唐山电业局和电厂的中共党委员会针对这种思想，召开了党员干部会议，提出了检修中停电时间是否过长，能否发动职工把废料变成有用的东西等等生产中的具体问题，让大家讨论。经过讨论后，大家一致认为检修中由于单纯注意安全，检修停电的时间确是太长，也一致认为只要发动工人群众，就有办法把废料变成有用的东西。这样就消除了某些党员干部认为不能增产的思想。接着中共党的组织、工会、和青年团组织就分别向党员、团员和全体工会会员进行动员。电业局又召开了局务干部扩大会议进行讨论。在这些会上，大家检讨出过去认为没有办法增产主要是保守思想和自满情绪作怪；同时研究出许多增产节约的具体办法。如省煤模范李秀俊提出了煤耗还可由每度电用零点五八公斤降低到零点五七七公斤。发电厂的工程师赵维周等提出了十二月份的小检修时间可以缩短一天，给国家增产小米一万斤。电业局外线工人曹鸿泉和技术员王维德提出变压器的使用有浪费，还可以撤回二百至三百的瓩容量。各个车间和小组在讨论制订增产节约具体计划时，曾反复开多次车间和小组会议，工人们又进一步想出了许多办法，如煤耗标准经过工人具体讨论后又由原节约计划规定的零点五七七公斤降到零点五六八公斤，这样两个月就可给国家省煤四百零一吨。变压器的使用也由原计划撤回二百至三百的瓩容量增加到六百的瓩容量。至十月二十七日，电业局和电厂全体职工计划的增产价值已达到十亿多元，节约价值达九千六百多万元。本月七日，就召开了全体职工大会，一致保证在第四季度内给国家增产节约价值五百吨小米的财富。大会通过写信给毛主席，保证完成这个任务和做好一九五二年增产节约计划的准备工作。全体职工并表示愿和全国职工一起开展爱国主义的增产节约竞赛。现在唐山电业局和唐山发电厂的增产节约运动已经热烈展开。
