　　State-Owned Economy Grows, Market Management Strengthened
    National Prices Basically Stable Since Winter
    [Xinhua News Agency, 15th] Since the beginning of winter, national prices have been basically stable. Prices of some major essential consumer goods that had once risen have gradually and rationally fallen since the end of September, and have now returned to the level of August.

    Looking at the month-on-month index of 32 major commodities in the six major cities of Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, Xi'an, and Chongqing, October decreased by 0.2 percent compared to September. Last autumn and winter, prices were also generally stable, but last October increased by 5 percent compared to September.

    In the first half of this year, the national market experienced an unprecedented off-season boom, indicating that people's purchasing power is rapidly increasing. Therefore, people were once worried that after the autumn harvest, materials might not be sufficient to meet demand, and prices might fluctuate. This concern was not without reason. The price index of the aforementioned 32 commodities in the six major cities showed a slight increase in September. Taking the end of last year as the base period, it was 114.2 at the end of August this year, and reached 115.9 on September 24, forming the peak of this year's prices.

    However, prices gradually fell back afterwards, reaching 114.3 at the end of October and 114.1 on the 10th of this month.

    People's purchasing power did indeed increase significantly after autumn. In the above-mentioned six major cities plus Shenyang and Qingdao, the transaction volume of grain in October this year increased by nearly one-third (28.1 percent) compared to the same period last year, and cloth increased by one time (104.6 percent).

    The main reasons for maintaining price stability are the growth of the state-owned economy and the strengthening of market management. State-owned banks have effectively controlled finance. State-owned trade began to expand supply from late September, thus gradually eliminating the psychology of waiting for higher prices in the market.

    Due to the large arrival of goods from the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, state-owned trade has successively reduced the prices of industrial equipment and petroleum three times from August to October. Due to the reduction of production and circulation costs, state-owned trade has also reduced the price of bituminous coal twice. Oil and salt prices were therefore reduced once in late September. At the same time, cotton farmers actively sold new cotton to the state, and cotton and cloth from fraternal countries also arrived in time, which provided strong support for the rapid increase in production and expansion of supply of yarn and cloth.

    During the National Day celebration period, state-owned trade offered a 5 percent discount on retail prices for two weeks. From October, state-owned trade also universally supplied cotton wadding and soda ash, causing the prices of these two essential commodities, which had been rising daily in September, to fall sharply. For example, the market price of cotton wadding in Beijing fell by nearly half in half a month, reaching a reasonable level.

    In total, the sales amount of state-owned trade in October increased by nearly one-third compared to September, and more than doubled compared to the same period last year. Among them, the sales volume of grain increased by one and a half times compared to the same period last year, and cloth increased by nearly one time.

    With the improvement and strengthening of state-owned economy in its work, coupled with the support of fraternal countries, price stability has been increasingly guaranteed.

### 国营经济壮大、市场管理加强  全国物价入冬以来基本稳定

　　国营经济壮大、市场管理加强
    全国物价入冬以来基本稳定
    【新华社十五日讯】入冬以来全国物价基本稳定，若干一度上升的主要的生活必需品价格从九月尾逐步合理下跌，现在已回复到八月的水平。
    从上海、天津、汉口、广州、西安和重庆这六大城市三十二种主要商品的环比指数看，十月比九月下跌了百分之零点二。去年秋冬物价也是大体上稳定的，但是去年十月比九月上升了百分之五。
    今年上半年全国市场空前地出现了淡季旺销的景象，表明人民购买力正在迅速提高。因此人们曾经耽心：到了秋收以后，物资可能不足以供应需要，物价可能发生波动，这种耽心不是没有理由的。上述六大城市三十二种商品的价格指数在九月间是呈微升状态的，以去年年底为基期，今年八月底为一一四点二，九月二十四日竟达到一一五点九，形成了本年物价的最高峰。
    但是以后物价就逐步回跌，到十月底为一一四点三，本月十日为一一四点一。
    人民购买力在秋后确实显著提高了。上述六大城市加上沈阳和青岛，今年十月粮食的成交量比去年同期增加了将近三分之一（百分之二十八点一），布匹增加了一倍（百分之一○四点六）。
    物价所以保持稳定的主要原因是国营经济的壮大和市场管理的加强。国营银行有力地掌握了金融。国营贸易从九月下旬开始扩大供应，因而逐渐扫除了市场上待价惜售的心理。
    由于苏联和其他兄弟国家的来货大量到达，国营贸易从八月到十月曾连续三次降低了工业器材和石油的价格。由于生产和流通费用的减低，国营贸易又连续两次降低了烟煤的价格。油盐牌价，因此在九月下旬降低一次。同时，棉农踊跃把新花出卖给国家，兄弟国家的棉花和布匹也及时而来，这就使纱布的突击增产和扩大供应得到了有力的支持。
    庆祝国庆节期间，国营贸易在零售方面九五折减价两星期。十月起，国营贸易又普遍供应絮棉和纯碱，使这两种在九月间逐日高涨的必需品价格急剧回跌，比如北京的絮棉市价就因此在半个月内回跌了将近一半，达到了合理的水平。
    总计国营贸易在十月份出售的金额比九月增加了将近三分之一，比去年同期增加了一倍以上。其中粮食类的出售量比去年同期增加了一倍半，布匹增加了将近一倍。
    随着国营经济在工作上的改进和力量的加强，再加上兄弟国家的支持，物价的稳定就得到了日益有力的保证。
