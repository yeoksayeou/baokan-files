    The unity between the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean people is like that of a family. The top picture shows the Volunteer soldiers using their free time after battle to help the Korean people thresh rice. The bottom picture shows Volunteer medical personnel treating Korean children in the area where they are stationed.
