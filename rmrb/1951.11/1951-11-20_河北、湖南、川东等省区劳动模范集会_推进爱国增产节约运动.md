    Hebei, Hunan, Eastern Sichuan, and Other Provinces and Regions Labor Model Gatherings
    Promote the Patriotic Production Increase and Thrift Movement
    [Our Newspaper] To respond to and implement Chairman Mao's call at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to "increase production and practice thrift to support the Chinese People's Volunteers," Hebei, Hunan, Eastern Sichuan, and other provinces and regions respectively convened representative conferences of industrial and agricultural labor models to exchange advanced production experiences, strengthen the ideology of the worker-peasant alliance, and encourage labor models to play a backbone role, a leading role, and a bridge role in various production tasks, driving the masses to universally carry out the production increase and thrift movement.
    The Hebei Province Industrial and Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference, held from November 5th to 14th, discussed intensively and enthusiastically how to realize Chairman Mao's call, carry out a mass production increase and thrift movement, and complete and exceed the 1952 industrial and agricultural production tasks. Industrial and agricultural labor model representatives unanimously stated that they would actively lead workers and peasants to carry out the patriotic production increase and thrift movement. In industrial production, they would actively unleash the potential of existing equipment and create new production records. In agricultural production, they would vigorously increase yields per unit area to strengthen the power to resist America and aid Korea. Industrial labor model representatives Li Xiujun and Liu Baozhong, agricultural labor model representatives Geng Changsuo, Zhang Xishun, Rong Guanxiu, Gao Guandou, and Liu Changwen, among others, formulated and reported their production increase and thrift plans and plans to lead the masses in production increase and thrift during the conference. Industrial labor model representatives, some representing individuals, some representing a workshop, a group, and some representing the entire factory, made guarantees to the conference. They all proposed to increase production on the basis of the original output, with some proposing to increase the original output by 10% to 30%. In terms of reducing costs, some proposed to reduce them by 5% or 10% to 20%. Zhao Naibin, a labor model representative from Tangshan Steel Plant, proposed on behalf of the entire plant to increase steel production rate by 60%. Liu Qingsheng, a labor model representative from Baoding Power Plant, proposed to save 33.3% of coal per month. Agricultural labor model representatives also proposed guarantee conditions when reporting their plans. Agricultural labor model representatives Geng Changsuo, Zhang Xishun, Zou Yubin, and Song Luoxue, among others, also initiated a "Ten Thousand Household, Thousand Village Model High-Yield Movement" throughout the province, requiring each mu of cotton to produce more than 400 jin, wheat to produce more than 400 jin, millet to produce more than 600 jin, corn to produce more than 500 jin, and yam to produce more than 6,000 jin, with the number of model high-yield households reaching 10,000, and the number of model high-yield households producing more than 1,000 jin of rice per mu reaching 1,000. At the same time, they strive to develop 10,000 model high-yield groups, requiring an increase in production of 30% on the basis of this year's output; develop 1,000 model high-yield villages, requiring an increase in production of 20% to 25%. Each county should have a model high-yield area, requiring an increase in production of 15% to 20%. Each special district should have a model high-yield county, requiring an increase in production of 10% to 15%. This proposal was warmly responded to by all agricultural labor model representatives, and more than 500 agricultural labor model representatives immediately signed up to participate in this movement.
    Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, at the meeting, commended the model actions of industrial and agricultural labor models in unanimously responding to Chairman Mao's call for production increase and thrift, and emphasized: In 1952, the patriotic actions of a small number of labor models should be developed into the patriotic actions of the majority, and a large-scale mass movement of industrial and agricultural patriotic production increase and thrift should be launched throughout Hebei Province. In industrial production, the patriotic production increase and thrift movement should be carried out on the basis of democratic reform, and the economic accounting system should be implemented throughout the year. Under this spirit, increase production and reduce costs. In agricultural production, on the basis of 1951, concentrate efforts to increase yields per unit area, vigorously implement the policy of organizing, first of all, develop a large number of small temporary mutual aid teams, and secondly, improve the existing mutual aid teams in a step-by-step manner. He called on labor models not to be arrogant and complacent, not to be divorced from the masses, to strive to learn advanced experience and current affairs policies, actively improve production technology, and promote experience, so that the banner of labor models can fly everywhere.
    The First Hunan Province Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference lasted for seven days from November 1st to the 7th. A total of 753 representatives attended the conference, including labor model representatives from five ethnic minority groups: Miao, Hui, Yao, Yi, and Zhuang, in addition to the Han nationality. During the conference, patriotic ideological education was carried out from beginning to end. The representatives listened to various typical reports and conducted group discussions, exchanged production experiences, and further realized the correct direction of organizing to develop production. At the same time, after visiting the factory, the representatives more clearly recognized the leading role of the working class and the importance of consolidating the worker-peasant alliance and strengthening urban-rural mutual assistance. Therefore, the representatives' production enthusiasm was greatly boosted, and their confidence in increasing yields per unit area and striving for a greater harvest next year was enhanced. In order to respond to Chairman Mao's call for production increase and thrift, the representatives specifically formulated nine patriotic production increase and thrift covenants, guaranteeing resolute implementation, and suggested that all farmers in the province accept this covenant as a program of action for the patriotic actions of all farmers. At the same time, they wrote a letter to Chairman Mao making two guarantees: 1. Take the lead in striving to complete Hunan's 1952 agricultural production plan. Each representative attending the conference guarantees to increase rice production by 100 to 200 jin per mu. 2. Be sure to guard against arrogance and impetuosity, closely connect with the masses, strengthen learning, continuously improve political and cultural levels, always maintain the glorious title of labor model, and always follow Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, playing a model, leading, and bridge role in the patriotic production increase and thrift movement. Jin Ming, Deputy Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, congratulated the labor model representatives on behalf of the Provincial Committee and requested the representatives to convey the spirit of the conference to the masses after returning, and to lead the masses to universally carry out the production increase and thrift movement, and continue to strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea.
    The First Eastern Sichuan District Industrial Labor Model Representative Conference opened on the 10th. This conference was convened based on the resolution of the administrative conference of the Eastern Sichuan District People's Administrative Office. The purpose is to encourage the working enthusiasm of the working class in the district on the production front, give play to the initiative and creativity of the working class, establish a glorious banner on the production front, and lay the foundation for carrying out the production increase and thrift movement in the future.
    One hundred and fourteen representatives reported for attendance, and eighty-three representatives attended as observers. Among them, there are 166 worker model representatives, 14 staff model representatives, 6 technical personnel model representatives, and 11 administrative management personnel model representatives.
