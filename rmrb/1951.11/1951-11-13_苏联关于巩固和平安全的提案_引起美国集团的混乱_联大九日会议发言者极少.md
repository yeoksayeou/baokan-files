　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 12th dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary session on the 9th to continue the general debate. Extremely few representatives requested to speak at the meeting. Only representatives from five countries, including New Zealand, Cuba, Honduras, Australia, and Haiti, spoke during the two sessions, morning and afternoon. Because no one requested to speak, the President of the General Assembly, Nasrollah Entezam, announced that the general debate would be suspended and continued on the 12th.

　　Journalists believe that the phenomenon of no one wanting to speak on the UN podium is due to the clear and concrete proposals on consolidating peace and security put forward by the Soviet representative on the 8th, which have struck a blow to the slanderous propaganda of the United States, causing confusion among the majority of countries in the American bloc. Representatives of these countries are in a state of disarray and are trying to buy time in order to obtain instructions from the US delegation on their speeches.

　　苏联关于巩固和平安全的提案
    引起美国集团的混乱
    联大九日会议发言者极少
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：联合国大会九日举行全体会议，继续进行一般辩论。要求在会上发言的代表极为稀少，上下午两次会议仅有新西兰、古巴、洪都拉斯、澳大利亚、海地等五国代表发言。因为没有人要求发言，大会主席纳孚宣布一般辩论暂停，至十二日再继续进行。
    新闻界人士认为：这种没有人要到联合国讲坛上发言的现象，是由于苏联代表在八日所提出的明确而具体的关于巩固和平和安全的提案，打击了美国的诽谤性宣传，已在美国集团多数国家中引起混乱，使得这些国家的代表狼狈不堪，他们正试图争取时间，以便取得美国代表团对他们发言的指示。
