Xinhua News Agency, 23rd. Under the heavy pressure of the Truman government's war economy policy, the strike movement of the American working class is developing day by day, and strikes have seriously hit the US government's war preparations. Not long ago, New York dockworkers, defying the opposition of reactionary union leaders and the suppression of the government, held a 26-day strike. Although the strike has now been temporarily suspended on the 10th pending investigation, the workers demonstrated strong unity and fighting spirit in this strike, which greatly surprised the American reactionaries. The strike paralyzed the docks of New York and Boston, hitting important military transportation supplying the US military invading Korea. According to American newspapers, the strike cost the largest port and commercial city in the United States as much as one billion US dollars.

At the same time as the New York dockworkers' strike, or shortly before, strikes were also held by workers in many industrial sectors such as copper mines, airplanes, electrical, steelmaking, lead mines, construction, automobiles, atomic energy, machinery, and transportation, as well as many independent industries. The characteristic of these strikes is that most of them occurred precisely in the so-called "defense" industrial sectors that the US government and monopoly capitalists are most concerned about, and seriously affected US military production. The strike of 58,000 copper miners at the end of August caused 90 percent of the production of copper, which is listed as a so-called "rare" material in US military production, to come to a standstill.

According to American newspapers, the strikes by workers in several large aircraft factories and aircraft engine factories in the United States in August and September reduced the production of this so-called number one "defense" order by half. Regarding the "seriousness" of the strikes in the aircraft manufacturing industry, the magazine *U.S. News & World Report* revealed on October 26: "Investigations show that at a time when the production of military aircraft has already failed to meet the plan... officials say: The losses from this strike are irreparable."

The recent large-scale strikes in the atomic energy industry, which the US government considers to be the most important military industrial sector, have also greatly hindered the production of atomic weapons and the expansion plans of atomic factories.

The continuous rise of the American strike movement is a direct result of the US ruling group's implementation of a war economy policy and lowering the living standards of workers. According to the official greatly reduced index in the United States, the cost of living in the United States has risen by more than 10 percent since the beginning of the war of aggression against Korea. At the same time, the Truman government's two tax increases have made the workers' tax burden 20 percent heavier since the end of last year than before the Korean War. The third new tax levied on November 1 will increase the taxes paid by workers by another 12 percent.

Due to the high cost of living and the continuous increase in taxes, workers' wage income has generally declined. *U.S. News & World Report*, even based entirely on official statistics, had to admit that the real wages of American workers are now generally lower than before the Korean War. On October 12, the publication listed 22 important industrial sectors where workers' incomes have decreased, including automobile workers whose wages have decreased by 11.5 percent, hard coal miners whose wages have decreased by 5.3 percent, textile workers whose wages have decreased by 4.7 percent, and in the oil industry, where capitalists obtained particularly high profits, workers' wages decreased by 1.2 percent. Under this intensified exploitation, workers are increasingly aware that they must take action to defend their right to live.

At present, more and larger-scale strikes to fight for higher wages are brewing in the United States. Electrical workers, railway workers, steel workers, oil workers, and coal miners with strong trade union organizations have either already proposed demands for wage increases or are discussing proposing demands for wage increases.

The increasingly developing strike movement has made the US monopoly capitalist government deeply uneasy, and Truman has increasingly anxiously come forward to interfere in the strikes. However, even *U.S. News & World Report*, the mouthpiece of Wall Street, had to admit: "It is becoming increasingly difficult to stop or prevent strikes with government orders." The chairman of the US Wage Stabilization Board, Van Zandt, also said that it would be a "miracle" to maintain the current wage level this winter.

### 美国罢工运动打击了美政府备战计划  反动报刊承认美国政府镇压罢工已愈来愈困难

　　美国罢工运动打击了美政府备战计划       
    反动报刊承认美国政府镇压罢工已愈来愈困难
    【新华社二十三日讯】在杜鲁门政府战争经济政策的重压下，美国工人阶级的罢工运动日益发展，罢工已严重打击了美国政府的备战计划。不久以前，纽约码头工人不愿工会反动领袖的反对和政府的镇压，举行了历时二十六天的大罢工。罢工现在虽然因等候调查而于十日暂告结束，但是，在这次罢工中，工人们表现了坚强的团结和战斗的精神，使美国反动派大为吃惊。这次罢工瘫痪了纽约和波斯顿的码头，打击了重要的、供应侵朝美军的军事运输。据美国报纸消息，罢工使美国这个最大的港埠和商业城市损失达十亿美元。
    与纽约码头工人大罢工同时或在这以前不久举行罢工的，还有铜矿、飞机、电气、炼钢、铅矿、建筑、汽车、原子能、机器等许多工业部门和运输业以及许多独立行业的工人。这些罢工的特点，是大部分都恰恰发生在美国政府和垄断资本家最为关切的所谓“国防”工业部门，并使美国的军事生产受到严重影响。八月底五万八千名铜矿工人的罢工曾使美国军事生产中列为所谓“稀有”物资的铜的生产百分之九十陷于停顿。
    据美国报纸透露，今年八、九月间美国几家大飞机工厂和飞机引擎工厂工人的罢工，曾使美国政府这项所谓头号“国防”定货的生产减少了一半。关于飞机制造业中罢工的“严重性”，十月二十六日《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志曾透露：“调查表明，在这军用飞机生产已经未能完成计划的时候，……官员们说：这种罢工的损失是无法弥补的。”
    美国政府认为最关紧要的军事工业部门——原子能工业中新近发生的规模不小的罢工，也使原子武器生产和原子工厂的扩充计划受到重大阻碍。
    美国罢工运动的不断高涨是美国统治集团推行战争经济政策、降低工人生活水平的直接结果。据美国官方大大压低了的指数，美国生活费用从侵朝战争开始以来上升已超过百分之十。同时，杜鲁门政府的两次增税已使工人的捐税负担自去年年底以来比朝鲜战争前加重了百分之二十。而十一月一日起开征的第三次新增税，将使工人所纳的税再增加百分之十二。
    由于生活费用高涨和捐税的不断增加，工人们的工资收入普遍下降。《美国新闻与世界报道》甚至是完全根据官方的统计，也不得不承认现在美国工人实际工资已较朝鲜战争前普遍降低。十月十二日该刊列举了二十二种工人收入减少的重要工业部门，其中汽车工人工资降低了百分之十一·五，硬煤开采工人降低了百分之五·三，纺织工人降低了百分之四·七，在资本家获得特别高额利润的石油工业中，工人的工资降低了百分之一·二。在这种加紧的压榨下，工人们日益认识到必须以行动来保卫他们的生活权利。
    现在，美国国内正酝酿着更多的、规模更大的争取提高工资的罢工。有着强大工会组织的电气工人、铁路工人、钢铁工人、石油工人和煤矿工人或者已经提出增加工资的要求，或者正在讨论提出增加工资的要求。
    日益发展的罢工运动使美国垄断资本家的政府深感不安，杜鲁门已愈来愈焦躁地出面干涉罢工。但是，连华尔街的喉舌《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志也不得不承认：“用政府命令来停止或阻止罢工是愈来愈困难了。”美国工资稳定委员会主席范辛格尔也说：能够在今冬保持目前的工资水平，将是“天大的奇迹”。
