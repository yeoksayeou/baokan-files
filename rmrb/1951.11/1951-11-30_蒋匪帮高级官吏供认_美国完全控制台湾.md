    News from Xinhua News Agency, 29th: Hong Kong news: The fact that American imperialists have invaded our country's territory of Taiwan is something even the Chiang Kai-shek clique cannot deny. A journalist who returned to Hong Kong from Taiwan declared that Liu Chien-chun, the former president of the Legislative Yuan of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet government in Taiwan, said that American imperialism has now completely controlled the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime, and the U.S. military advisory group in Taiwan directly monitors the activities of the Kuomintang's various "yuan" and "government" departments. Liu Chien-chun said that in the past year, all "government" resolutions have been approved by Chase, the head of the U.S. military advisory group in Taiwan, before they are "passed." Liu also said that senior Kuomintang officials believe that the position of "President" of the "National Government" is actually held by an American advisor. The aforementioned journalist pointed out that even Chen Cheng, the "Premier of the Executive Yuan" of the Chiang Kai-shek "government," himself admitted that Chase enjoys absolute influence in Taiwan. Chen Cheng said that Kuomintang officials are completely controlled by the Americans in every respect.

    蒋匪帮高级官吏供认
    美国完全控制台湾
    【新华社二十九日讯】香港消息：美国帝国主义者侵占我国领土台湾的事实，甚至连蒋匪帮也不能不承认。从台湾回到香港的新闻记者宣称：台湾蒋匪帮傀儡政府前立法院长刘匪健群说，目前美国帝国主义已完全控制住蒋匪帮伪政权，美国驻台湾军事代表团直接监视着国民党各“院”和“政府”的活动。刘匪健群说，最近一年以来，“政府”所有决议案，都是先经美国驻台湾军事代表团团长蔡斯批准，然后才“通过”的。刘匪又说，国民党高级官吏认为：“国府”“总统”的职位实际上已由美国顾问担任。上述新闻记者指出，就是蒋匪“政府”“行政院长”陈匪诚本人也承认蔡斯在台湾享有绝对的影响。陈诚说，国民党官吏处处完全受美国人支配。
