Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 28th: According to TASS Berlin, at its closing meeting on the 21st, the Berlin Conference of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council adopted a resolution on item 2 of the agenda concerning "The solidarity of working people in the struggle to improve living conditions and oppose the economic and social consequences of war preparation policies." The resolution stated that due to the imperialists' war preparations, the living standards and purchasing power of working people in capitalist and colonial countries are declining daily, thereby worsening the overall economic situation in these countries and impoverishing the middle class day by day. Therefore, the struggle of the working class to defend and demand improved living standards also represents the interests of the middle class. We should encourage the middle class to actively support the working people to expand the battle lines in the struggle for bread, freedom, and peace.

The resolution then pointed out the deteriorating living standards of working people in capitalist and colonial countries, stating: In the United States, actual wages have decreased by one-third in the years since the war. In the year since the launch of the aggressive war in Korea, the cost of living in the United States has risen by 14 percent. According to greatly reduced official statistics, there are also millions of unemployed and semi-unemployed people in the United States. In Britain, the prices of basic necessities are now double what they were before the war; in the year since the Korean War, the cost of living has risen by 25 percent. In France, the actual hourly wages of workers and employees are half what they were before the war, but taxes have more than doubled. In Italy, according to official statistics, the income of three-quarters of families is not enough to meet the minimum living needs, and the income of 49 percent of families is not even enough to buy food; there are more than five million unemployed and semi-unemployed people in the country. In colonies and dependent countries, millions of people also live like beggars. Due to inhumane working and living conditions, and due to hunger and infectious diseases, the mortality rate of working people is constantly rising. But on the other hand, monopoly capitalists have obtained huge profits due to the cruel exploitation of working people. For example, from 1946 to 1951, the profits of major American monopoly capitalists increased two-fold, and the profits of major British monopoly capitalists increased one-fold.

The resolution stated that only countries pursuing a policy of peace can continuously raise the living standards of working people. The resolution then pointed out the vigorous development of the national economies and the continuous improvement of people's welfare in the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the People's Democratic countries, and the German Democratic Republic, and emphasized that these achievements consolidate the cause of world peace and become a source of strength and confidence for working people in capitalist and colonial countries.

The resolution also stated that the working people of capitalist and colonial countries, despite the brutal oppression and police terror of monopoly capitalists, are strengthening their struggle against the policies of war, hunger, and poverty. The many strikes and struggles launched by millions of working people in these countries prove this point. Working people have become more aware of the importance of united action in the struggle. For example, this year in France, workers belonging to the General Confederation of Labour, the Catholic Confederation of Labour, and "Workers' Force" all participated in the struggle to raise wages, and these struggles mostly achieved victory. Other examples, such as the strikes of Italian metalworkers, agricultural workers, and civil servants, the strikes of German metalworkers in Hesse and dockworkers in Hamburg, and the strikes of American miners and dockworkers, also show the prominent characteristics of united action.

The resolution stated that the working people have recognized in the struggle the conspiracy of right-wing trade union leaders and the heads of the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" to undermine the trade union movement. They support the monopoly capitalists' policies of preparing for war, freezing wages, and intensifying the exploitation of working people, and attempt to sabotage the working people's strike movement and split the African and Asian trade union movements in order to obstruct the people of colonial countries from carrying out national liberation struggles.

Therefore, the World Federation of Trade Unions Council put forward a concrete program to the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions, national trade unions of various countries, the World Federation of Trade Unions' trade union internationals, and all trade union organizations to strengthen trade union activities, fight for improved living conditions, oppose war preparations, oppose the policies of reactionaries and their agents in trade unions, oppose sectarianism, and strive for united action. Trade union organizations must fight to achieve the following demands: guarantee full employment and wages that guarantee a minimum standard of living, implement an index-linked wage system, abolish the "speed-up" system, implement social insurance and social security systems funded by the government and employers, abolish racial discrimination, abolish all forms of forced labor, establish equal pay for equal work for female, child, and male workers, and sign collective contracts.

The resolution called on trade union organizations to widely publicize the importance of the International Economic Conference to be held in Moscow next April, and to strive for the success of this conference. The resolution also called on all working people to strengthen their ranks, and emphasized: "Gaining victory in the struggle for unity of action is the guarantee for working people to obtain a better life, freedom, and peace."

    世界工联理事会关于议程第二项的决议
    指出资本主义和殖民地国家劳动人民生活日益恶化
    必须加强工会活动争取改善生活反对帝国主义备战 【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：世界工会联合会理事会柏林会议在二十一日的闭幕会议上，就议程第二项关于“劳动人民在争取改善生活条件、反对备战政策的经济和社会后果的斗争中的团结”通过了一项决议。决议说：由于帝国主义者的战争准备，资本主义国家和殖民地国家劳动人民的生活水准和购买力日渐降低，从而使这些国家总的经济情况更加恶化，中等阶层人民一天天贫困。因此，工人阶级保卫和要求改善生活水准的斗争，也代表了中等阶层人民的利益。我们应当使中等阶层的人民积极支持劳动人民，以扩大争取面包、自由与和平的斗争的战线。
    决议接着指出资本主义国家和殖民地国家劳动人民生活水准日益恶化的情况说：在美国，战后几年来，实际工资已下降了三分之一。在发动侵略朝鲜战争以来的一年中，美国生活费用上升了百分之十四。根据大为缩小了的官方统计，美国失业和半失业人数也有几百万人。在英国，现在基本必需品的价格比战前上涨了一倍；在朝鲜战争以来的一年中，生活费用上涨了百分之二十五。在法国，工人和职员每小时的实际工资比战前减少了一半，但赋税却增加了二倍多。在意大利，据官方统计，有四分之三的家庭的收入赶不上最低生活的需要，百分之四十九的家庭的收入甚至不够购买食物；全国失业和半失业的人数有五百万以上。在殖民地和附属国，千百万人民也过着乞丐般的生活。由于非人的工作条件和居住条件，由于饥饿和传染病，劳动人民的死亡率在不断上升。但在另一方面，垄断资本家由于对劳动人民进行残酷的掠夺获得了巨大的利润。例如，从一九四六年到一九五一年，美国大垄断资本家的利润就增加了二倍，英国大垄断资本家的利润增加了一倍。
    决议说：只有奉行和平政策的国家，劳动人民的生活水准才能不断上升。决议接着指出苏联、中华人民共和国、人民民主国家和德意志民主共和国的国民经济蓬勃发展和人民福利不断增进的情形，并强调说：这些成就巩固了世界和平的事业，并且成为资本主义国家和殖民地国家劳动人民的力量和信心的泉源。
    决议又说：资本主义国家和殖民地国家的劳动人民，不顾垄断资本家的残暴压迫和警察恐怖，正在加强斗争，反对战争、饥饿和贫困的政策。这些国家的千百万劳动人民所发动的许多次罢工和斗争就证明了这一点。劳动人民已在斗争中更加明白一致行动的重要性。例如，今年法国不论隶属于法国总工会、天主教劳工联盟、“工人力量”的工人都参加了争取提高工资的斗争，而且这些斗争大都取得了胜利。其他如意大利五金工人、农业工人和公务员的罢工，德国黑森州五金工人和汉堡码头工人的罢工，美国矿工和码头工人的罢工等，也表现有一致行动的显著特色。
    决议说：劳动人民已在斗争中认识了右翼工会头子和“国际自由工会联合会”头子破坏工会运动的阴谋。他们支持垄断资本家的准备战争、冻结工资、加紧剥削劳动人民的政策，并妄图破坏劳动人民的罢工运动，分裂非洲和亚洲工会运动，以阻挠殖民地国家的人民进行民族解放斗争。
    因此，世界工联理事会向世界工联执行局、各国全国性工会、世界工联各工会国际和一切工会组织提出具体纲领，加强工会活动，争取改善生活，反对准备战争，反对反动派的政策及其在工会中的代理人，反对宗派主义，争取一致行动。工会组织必须为实现下列要求而斗争：保障充分就业和保障最低生活水准的工资，实行指数工资制度，废除“赶快”制度，由政府和雇主出钱实行社会保险和社会安全制度，废除种族歧视，废除各种形式的强迫劳动，建立女工童工和男工同工同酬制，签订集体合同。
    决议号召各工会组织广泛宣传将在明年四月在莫斯科举行的国际经济会议的重要性，并努力促使这次会议成功。决议并号召全体劳动人民加强他们的队伍，并强调说：“在争取行动一致的斗争中获得胜利，就是劳动人民获得较好的生活、自由与和平的保证。”
