Xinhua News Agency, 18th Dispatch: The Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and the Ministry of Justice of the Central People's Government jointly issued a notice on the 16th, requiring the branch courts of the Supreme People's Court, the branch procuratorates of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and the Ministry of Justice in the four major administrative regions of Southwest, Central South, East China, and Northwest, as well as the People's Courts and People's Procuratorates of each province (city) and county, and the People's Courts and People's Procuratorates of Suiyuan and Hebei provinces, to actively participate in the work of the People's Courts. The notice pointed out: The experience of the people's judicial organs in land reform areas over the past year or so has proven that those who actively participate in and support the work of the People's Courts have not only supported the peasants and cracked down on illegal landlords and other counter-revolutionaries, serving the land reform, but have also established prestige among the masses and developed their own business. All people's judicial organs in land reform areas must regard the work of the People's Courts as their primary task, and are not allowed to remain aloof. The aforementioned People's Courts, People's Procuratorates, and judicial departments in various places should vigorously and actively participate in and support the work of the local People's Courts, become the backbone force in the work of the People's Courts, learn from the experience of the People's Courts, select cadres from the People's Courts to supplement themselves, and train the original judicial cadres, and build and develop our people's judicial work on this working basis. The notice also requires all localities to study the People's Daily editorial "Do a Good Job in the People's Court Work" and the previously issued "Instructions on the Work of the People's Courts," and, based on the specific conditions of each locality, consult with the local authorities to determine specific methods for participating in the People's Courts.
