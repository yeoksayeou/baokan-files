Wang Yizhi Writes to Mayor Peng Zhen
Expressing Satisfaction with the Court's Judgment

Mayor Peng:

My name is Wang Yizhi, and I was formerly the wife of Zeng Yi, the vice president of the North China Institute of Technology. We divorced in 1941; later, Zeng Yi took back the house I received from the government and refused to be responsible for my daughter's medical treatment. I could no longer endure it, so I requested the government and the court to resolve the matter.

On November 17th, the Beijing People's Court held a trial, and as a result, my problem was reasonably resolved: the family property that Zeng Yi should have received was awarded to me; Zeng Yi was ordered to be responsible for treating my daughter's illness; Zeng Yi was also criticized by comrades for hitting me in the past, and he made a self-criticism. I am grateful to the court for this fair and reasonable resolution, and I am grateful to Mayor Peng, the People's Government, and the comrades of the Women's Federation for their care and support.

Today, I deeply realize that the status of women has truly improved! I deeply realize the greatness of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao! Mayor Peng! I assure you that I will do a good job in my educational work, strive for the cultural construction of the new China! Strive for a better life in the future—the realization of socialist and communist society!

    王益智上书彭真市长
    对法院的判决表示满意彭市长：
    我叫王益智，从前是华北工学院副院长曾毅的妻子。一九四一年，我们离了婚；后来，曾毅把我在政府领的房子夺回去，也不负责给我女儿治病了。我实在忍受不下去了，才请求政府和法院给解决。
    十一月十七日，北京市人民法院开庭审判，结果，我的问题得到了合理的解决：曾毅应得的家庭财产判决给我了；我女儿的病，判决由曾毅负责治疗；曾毅以前打了我，也受了同志们的批评，他自己也作了检讨。我感激法院这种公平合理的解决，感激彭市长、人民政府和妇联同志们对我的关怀和支持。
  今天，我深深地体会到妇女地位是真的提高了！我深深地体会到共产党和毛主席的伟大！彭市长！我向您保证：我一定要搞好我的教育工作，为新中国的文化建设而奋斗！为将来更美好的生活——社会主义和共产主义社会的实现而努力！
