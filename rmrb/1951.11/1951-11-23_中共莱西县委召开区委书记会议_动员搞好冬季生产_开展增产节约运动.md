    The CPC Laixi County Committee in Shandong convened a meeting of all county district committee secretaries on the 14th of this month to inspect winter production and mobilize the launch of an increase production and practice economy campaign. Currently, approximately 170,000 mu of land has been winter-plowed in Laixi County, accounting for 34% of the county's land that should be winter-plowed. There has also been some progress in winter digging, sand pressing, and soil turning. However, based on the current situation, some problems still exist: the campaign has not been carried out deeply and forcefully enough, and many cadres and the masses have the mentality of "winter production can be done or not done" and "doing whatever can be done." Furthermore, some village cadres and the masses believe that "winter is a time for leisure, and we must rest no matter what," and "winter plowing and digging should be done when there is time, and if there is no time, forget about it." The main reason for these ideas is that cadres and the masses lack sufficient understanding of the significance of increasing production and practicing economy. In response to the above situation, the responsible comrade of the Laixi County Committee analyzed the relationship between winter production and resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and patriotic increase production, so that everyone recognized the importance of doing a good job in winter production. At the meeting, everyone calculated that if Laixi County could carry out winter production according to the original plan, the increase in production next year would be enormous. Taking winter-plowed land alone, if 400,000 mu of land are winter-plowed according to the plan, grain production can be increased by 4 million catties next year. It is estimated that the county's increase production and practice economy figures can reach more than 10% of the total annual agricultural production. After such a detailed discussion and calculation, Jiang Shuyun, Secretary of the Sixth District Committee, said: "Before the specific analysis, I showed complacency and slackness in leading winter production, and I lacked energy. Now I realize the significance of Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy." Lü Hongmei, Secretary of the Fifth District Committee, said: "This analysis makes it very clear that doing a good job in winter production is a concrete action to love the motherland and care for the lives of the masses. We must be determined to do a good job in winter production." Based on the current work situation, everyone researched the following methods to deeply lead the increase production and practice economy campaign: 1. Continue to deeply carry out ideological education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and patriotic increase production. Hold various meetings, and through inspecting winter production work, widely publicize the role of increase production and practice economy in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, building the country, and improving people's lives, so as to mobilize the masses ideologically and invest in the winter production campaign. 2. In conjunction with revising patriotic covenants, make doing a good job in winter production one of the contents of the patriotic covenants, so as to ensure the in-depth development of the increase production and practice economy campaign. 3. More broadly organize Party members, League members, representatives, models, cadres, militia, etc., to take the lead in action, so as to promote the comprehensive development of the winter production campaign. 4. Pay attention to leveraging the role of organization, and combine it with the work of consolidating mutual aid teams and strengthening the leadership of cooperatives.

    中共莱西县委召开区委书记会议
    动员搞好冬季生产
    开展增产节约运动
    中共山东莱西县委于本月十四日召开全县区委书记会议，检查冬季生产，动员开展增产节约运动。目前莱西全县已冬耕土地约十七万亩，占全县应冬耕土地的百分之三十四。冬刨、压沙、翻土亦有一定成绩。但照目前的情况看来还存在着一些问题：运动开展尚不够深入有力，不少的干部群众存在着“冬季生产做也可，不做也可”与“能做到什么样算什么样”的思想；更有些乡村干部和群众认为“冬天是闲散时候，不管怎么的也要歇歇”，“冬耕冬刨，有空就耕点刨点，没有空就算啦”。所以产生这些思想，主要是干部群众对增产节约的意义认识不足。针对以上情况，莱西县委负责同志分析了冬季生产工作与抗美援朝、爱国增产的关系，使大家认识到作好冬季生产工作的重要性。会上，大家计算了一下，莱西全县如能按照原计划进行冬季生产，则明年的增产数字是巨大的。单以冬耕土地来说，按计划冬耕土地四十万亩，明年即可增产粮食四百万斤。估计全县增产节约数字可以达到全年农业生产总产量的百分之十强。经过这样详细的讨论和计算，六区区委书记姜树云说：“在具体分析之前，我对领导冬季生产表现了麻痹自满，劲头不大，现在才认识到毛主席提出的增产节约号召的意义。”五区区委书记吕洪美说：“这样一分析，很明白，做好冬季生产工作是热爱祖国和关心群众生活的具体行动，一定要下决心，把冬季生产工作作好。”大家根据当前的工作情况，对深入领导增产节约运动，研究出如下办法：一、继续深入进行抗美援朝，爱国增产的思想教育。召开各种会议，通过检查冬季生产工作，广泛宣传增产节约对抗美援朝、建设国家和改善人民生活的作用，使群众从思想上动员起来，投入冬季生产运动。二、结合修订爱国公约，把作好冬季生产工作作为爱国公约的内容之一，以保证增产节约运动的深入开展。三、更广泛地组织党员、团员、代表、模范、干部、民兵等带头行动，以推动冬季生产运动的全面展开。四、注意发挥组织起来的作用，并结合进行整理互助组与加强合作社的领导等工作。
