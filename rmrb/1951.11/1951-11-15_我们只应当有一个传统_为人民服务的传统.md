　　We Should Only Have One Tradition – The Tradition of Serving the People
　　Hua Luogeng, Professor of Mathematics Department, Tsinghua University

　　In the severe winter, no one would seek seedlings, buds, flowers, or fruits in the fields. If one occasionally sees one or two verdant pines and cypresses, one would be very pleased, because in the face of cruel ice and snow, they still stand proud and cold-resistant. But when spring arrives, the mood is greatly different. Everyone wants to see prosperity, and impatient people can't wait for a spring breeze to blow across the land, covering it with flowers and lush leaves. If, after several heavy rains, there are still some dead branches, it will immediately cause disappointment and raise questions: Is this tree aging? Is the soil not fertile enough? In short, when spring arrives, we always eagerly await the arrival of new life.

　　This is the mood I have when writing this article. Under the brutal and reactionary Chiang regime, Tsinghua, although not a completely satisfactory institution, was acceptable because, like the severe winter, lush forests were not expected. What was generally sought from Tsinghua were pines and cypresses standing proudly against the cold. In this regard, it did not disappoint. It made some contributions. But today – in the new democratic era, it feels somewhat inadequate! Especially under the leadership of the Communist Party, the spring rain has deeply penetrated the soil, but we have yet to see a patch of greenery. Sometimes, among the seedlings and buds, there are still many weeds, and even some fields have not been cultivated. Have the cultivators exerted their greatest strength? We feel there is a need to examine this!

　　Last year, shortly after I embraced the motherland, I only had a heart devoted to the light. I was a complete fantasist, an impractical person who "imagined flowers and fruits from a single spring breeze." Before the Higher Education Conference, a reporter from Guangming Daily came to solicit my opinion. At that time, I raised one of the shortcomings of Tsinghua that I had understood for more than a decade, in principle, the gist of which was: "The so-called traditions of various schools should now be abandoned! The only tradition we should establish is the tradition of wholeheartedly serving the people. All forms of mountain-stronghold mentality, cliques, and factions should no longer play any role." But on the third day after my speech was published, on the way to the city to attend the Higher Education Conference, a friend patted me on the shoulder and warned me: "Old brother, be careful when firing cannons, don't hit your own people." I was dumbfounded. A fantasist cannot withstand the test, especially since I was unfamiliar with new things at that time. Therefore, throughout the conference, I could only "listen" and dare not "speak"! This made me deeply realize that although the times have changed, the influence of the old society's factionalism still lingers.

　　"Tsinghua family," "Tsinghua spirit" – these slogans were originally products of the old society. In the old society, in order to climb up and make a living, one had to have "gangs" and pull "connections." These slogans were just "terms" within the gangs. But these terms sometimes led to opposition. For example, if "Tsinghua" is placed in opposition to the "Ministry of Education," it will lead to disobedience to leadership, lack of organization and discipline, and sometimes it will also stand in opposition to the interests of the people, resulting in work that is not in line with the interests of the people. The semi-colonial research I will mention below falls into this category.

　　Although everyone often mentions the "Tsinghua spirit," my understanding of the meaning of this term is not very clear. It may include many bright sides, but it is undeniable that it also includes the following dark sides. It at least contains some comprador ideology: A recent example is that a Tsinghua teacher went to a factory in Tianjin to visit and saw that the workers were concentrating on research because the finished products they cast contained air bubbles. After seeing this, the teacher immediately offered the opinion: This problem is easy to solve, you just need to use a certain type of sand produced in the United States! The workers glared at him, saw his badge, and said: "Oh, so you are from Tsinghua!" This fully reflects the "Tsinghua spirit," which once sent salesmen of American goods into Chinese society.

　　Another example is when Comrade Shen Yuan mentioned that "Of the ten of us who studied aviation, except for one who died, three of the other nine are in Taiwan, four are in the United States, and only he and Comrade Tu Shou'e serve in the motherland." These are very painful words. It raises the question of who Tsinghua is training talents for. A consistent pro-American education style has unconsciously poisoned some people, making them forget their motherland, and even more forget the people of their motherland.

　　Sometimes, people in Tsinghua even treat those who have some connection with the United States with a completely obedient attitude. The most concrete example is the respect that many people had for Chen Futian before liberation. He was an unlearned overseas Chinese from Honolulu, but unlike other overseas Chinese, he placed the interests of the United States above the interests of the motherland. During the discussion of his past in the Department of Foreign Languages, everyone unanimously hated his arrogance and domineering. After the meeting, a newly arrived comrade who joined Tsinghua asked me, if he was so arrogant and domineering, why didn't you fight him before liberation. This is a pointed question. Before liberation, who dared to fight this adopted son of American imperialism!

　　In short, in my opinion, the "Tsinghua spirit" contains quite a bit of unclean dross. It lacks combativeness and, even more so, lacks a burning enthusiasm for loving the motherland. To be more frank: the tradition of the "Tsinghua spirit" is not at all a tradition of serving the people! If we preserve it unchanged, it will affect the advancement of the revolutionary cause.

　　The past Tsinghua served a minority of people, and the objects it cultivated were only the so-called excellent "elect." One of the manifestations of this idea is the so-called "genius education." In Tsinghua's past education, many departments followed the "genius education" route, only paying attention to a few "geniuses" and not paying attention to the cultivation of general talents. Taking the Department of Mathematics, which I am familiar with, as an example: the department has been established for almost twenty years, but since its establishment, it has only graduated sixty-one undergraduates and seven graduate students. Among these graduates, only a minority are given special attention. In terms of equipment, can we only cultivate these few? No, absolutely not! In terms of need, is the society not in urgent need? That's not true either. But due to the erroneous view of traditional "genius education," we have failed to exert all our strength. Under the Chiang regime, we won't worry about it. But today, when the country is in dire need of talent, we cannot ignore it! If we still adhere to the erroneous "genius education" policy, then we can only create fewer people's cadres, which violates the principle of wholeheartedly serving the people.

　　This "genius education," "elect education" policy has led to the erroneous idea of ​​being arrogant and self-important. A friend put it well, at the moment of being admitted to Tsinghua, when seeing their name on the list, arrogance arises spontaneously. Because applying to Tsinghua is difficult, only one out of ten, one out of a hundred is selected, so being admitted makes one feel superior! And in the old society, going abroad was a ladder to promotion and wealth, and graduating from Tsinghua meant going abroad, so at the moment of being admitted, one was already intoxicated by the future dream of studying abroad, and unconsciously embarked on the path of "Tsinghua first, arrogance and self-importance." The tall buildings of "Shui Mu Tsinghua" are unparalleled in the country, and the glass libraries and cork floors are also worth boasting about! The teachers are rarely not foreign doctors – and therefore are so-called masters and great scholars. Returning from studying abroad goes without saying! High above the people, soaring into the sky!

　　Applying this spirit to the workplace, one feels that Tsinghua graduates are the best. Therefore, when employing and administering, one unconsciously supplements "Tsinghua people." And reflected in Tsinghua itself is the difficulty in broadly absorbing talent, and even those talents who are occasionally absorbed, although they have worked at Tsinghua for many years, still sometimes feel like guests!

　　Today, this arrogant and self-important spirit hinders progress and appears very serious: Some people are afraid of lowering quality by opening the door to workers and peasants, some people are afraid of not being able to hire "qualified" teachers by enrolling students in large numbers. Still others oppose running short-term training classes, believing that this will damage Tsinghua's gold-lettered signboard, and so on. In short, today Tsinghua's arrogant and self-important spirit is contrary to the tradition of serving the people, and therefore it is completely absurd! If we do not repent, we will never see the masses, let alone go to the masses and learn from the masses!

　　Now let's examine how we teach our graduate students and teaching assistants. It can be said that what we teach them is completely semi-colonial research. For example, the problems we work on are taken from foreign magazines, the methods are also copied from foreigners, and after the work is completed, it is also sent to foreign magazines. If it can be published, we are complacent. Under the influence of this style, we forget the motherland and also forget the people's demand for establishing a self-reliant science. No wonder after the enemy blockaded us, there were the following strange arguments: "If American magazines don't come, we can't write anything." "Without foreign magazines, how can we do special research?" In short, our so-called "research" that we boast about is a flower on a foreigner's head. It has no roots and is a decoration for others (perhaps too flattering).

　　These are inherent ailments, but they have not been eradicated to this day. In this upsurge of resisting America and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and land reform, we have also exposed many ideological problems. For example, at an important meeting, when discussing the signing of a patriotic pact, someone proposed to report a reactionary landlord hiding in Tsinghua, but the result was rejected! Where has our political study – the study of the three major movements – gone! We are unwilling to accept this basic test, can we still be considered revolutionary cadres, teachers of the people?

　　At the same time, there are many problems in leadership: there is a lack of clear ideological leadership, and the specific policies and guidelines for school work are never reported to the masses; on the contrary, sometimes immature plans are brought to the masses, stirring up the emotions of the masses, wasting the time of the masses, to discuss empty talk on paper. The most concrete example is the so-called "Tsinghua Department Adjustment Plan" this spring – a plan that lacks a mass base and lacks enthusiastic support from the leadership. Many meetings were held, confusing the masses, but the result was abandoned without a trace. Instead, it delayed the preparatory work for improving the teaching and research groups! This kind of ambitious but incompetent plan, this kind of plan starting from Tsinghua's own perspective, once again showed that the wish to "sincerely and completely dedicate Tsinghua to the people" is not sincere enough.

　　Of course, Tsinghua is not without glory. But if we still念念不忘 the past glory during the transformation period, then progress will undoubtedly be slower. In the current stage – the stage where we are all learning and transforming – let's put aside the boasting of past glory for the time being! We should try our best to discover our shortcomings and correct our shortcomings with the right medicine. Only in this way can our transformation be thorough, and can we better serve the people.

　　In recent weeks, the entire Tsinghua campus has been swept up in a wave of learning, and all the staff are eagerly seeking progress. This atmosphere has permeated our daily life; recently, our discussions have also focused on the question of "how can we make Tsinghua's existing strength serve the people more effectively?" This is undoubtedly a phenomenon worth congratulating ourselves on, and it is of epoch-making significance for Tsinghua. And it is generally recognized that the progress of our school is far behind various constructions. We realize that we cannot use our current education method – the wheels of an ox cart – to match the rapid economic construction – a galloping train. This recognition will undoubtedly promote the government's rational adjustment of departments. No wonder that after the government announced the Peking University and Tsinghua Department Adjustment Plan this time, it was unanimously and enthusiastically supported by us. But in the future, when actually implementing this plan, the shortcomings mentioned above may affect the perfect completion of our plan. In order to make our work more guaranteed – in fact, all future work is included – I boldly put forward some of our shortcomings to correct them before the advanced.

　　Thank the Communist Party for not only leading us to翻身, but also introducing us to the Bolshevik weapons – criticism and self-criticism. Although I am still an elementary school student, using this weapon to write for the first time here, my determination to learn to use this weapon is firm. Because it is the first time using it, mistakes are inevitable, because there is determination, so I hope comrades will use the same weapon to criticize me. I sincerely await criticism!

　　我们只应当有一个传统——为人民服务的传统
    清华大学数学系教授  华罗庚
    在严寒的冬季里，谁也不会在田野里寻求苗芽花果，偶尔看到了一两株翠柏苍松，就十分欣然，因为在残酷的冰雪里，它还是那样地傲霜耐寒。但在春天到来的时候，心情就大大地不同了，谁都想欣欣向荣，心急的人更恨不得一阵春风便把大地吹拂得花开遍野绿叶满枝。如在几阵透雨之后依然有些枯枝，那就立刻会使人失望而发生疑问：这株树难道是衰老了吗？地肥不够吗？总之，到春天的时候，我们总是那样地渴望着新生命的来临。
    这是我写这一篇文章时候的心情。在残暴反动的蒋政权之下，清华虽然不是完全可以满意的机构，但由于那时正如严冬的天气，郁郁的茂林本非所望。而一般所求于清华的是有苍松翠柏在那里傲寒挺立。关于这一点，它并没有使人失望，它是有过一些贡献的。但到了今天——新民主主义时代的今天，却有些不足之感了！特别是在共产党领导之下，春雨已经深深地浸透了土壤，但我们还未能见到一片青葱。有时在幼苗嫩芽之间，还夹杂了不少衰草，甚且还有些田园没有耕耘。耕耘者是否发挥出最大的力量？我们觉得有检查一下的必要！
    在去年我刚投入祖国怀抱之后不久，我那时仅有一颗投向光明的心。我是一个彻头彻尾的幻想者，“从一次春风就想到花果”的不切合实际的人。在开高等教育会议之前，光明日报的记者来征求意见。那时我便把十余年来所了解的清华缺点之一，原则性地提出来了，大意是：“所谓各学校的传统等等现在都应当放弃了！而我们所应当建立的传统只应当有一个，就是全心全意为人民服务的传统。一切山头主义，小圈子，小宗派都应当不再起任何作用。”但我这谈话发表后第三天，进城参加高等教育会议的车上，就有一位朋友拍了我的肩膀警告我说：“老兄放炮得小心，不要打了自己人。”我为之瞠目结舌。幻想者是经不起考验的，何况我那时对新事物是有生疏之感的。因之，在整个的会议中我就只能“听”而不敢“说”了！这使我深深地体会到时代虽然变了，但旧社会所带来的小宗派影响依然有些留存。
    “清华一家”，“清华精神”，这些口号原都是旧社会里的产物。在旧社会里为了向上爬，为了混饭碗，都必须有“帮口”，拉“关系”。而这些口号不过是帮口中的“术语”而已。但这术语却有时引起了对立。例如，如果把“清华”和“教育部”对立起来，就会产生不服从领导，无组织无纪律的现象，有时也会和人民的利益对立起来，搞出与人民利益不相符合的一些工作，我将在下面提到的半殖民地式的研究就属于此类。
    虽然大家都常提到“清华精神”，但我对于这一名词含义的了解还不十分明确。其中也许有很多的光明面，但无可讳言的它也包括了以下几个黑暗面。它至少有些买办思想在内：较近的例子，有一位清华教师去天津参观工厂，在工厂中看见工人们正在聚精会神地研究，因为那时他们翻砂出来的成品中夹有气泡。这位先生看了之后立刻就提了意见说：这问题是容易解决的，你只要用美国所出的某一号砂就行了！工人们瞪了他一眼，见了他的徽章，就说：“喔，原来你是清华的！”这充分地反映了“清华精神”，它曾经把美国货物的推销员送到了中国社会里。
    又如沈元同志有一次提起，他说：“我们那一班学航空的十人，除掉死亡了一位外，其他九位中三个在台湾，四个在美国，而在祖国服务的仅仅是他和屠守锷同志而已。”这是十分沉痛的话。使人发生清华究竟在为谁造就人才的疑问。一贯的崇美的教育作风使若干人不自觉地中上了毒素，忘掉了祖国，更忘掉了祖国的人民。
    有时甚至清华有人以百依百顺的态度对待和美国有些沾染的人。最具体的例证，就是解放以前很多人对于陈福田的尊敬。他是一个不学无术的火奴鲁鲁华侨，但他和其他侨胞不一样，他把美国的利益看在祖国的利益之上。这次在外国语文系里曾经讨论过他的过去，大家一致地痛恨他的横凶霸道。会后有一位新来参加清华工作的同志对我说，他既然如此横凶霸道，为什么在解放前不和他斗争。这是一针见血的话。在解放前对这美帝国主义的干儿子，谁敢和他斗争！
    总之，在我看来“清华精神”中颇有些不干不净的糟粕，它缺乏斗争性，更缺乏火一般的热爱祖国的热忱。更坦白地说：“清华精神”的传统根本不是为人民服务的传统！如果原封不动地保存它，这会影响到革命事业的推进的。
    过去的清华是为少数人服务的，而所培育的对象仅是些所谓优秀的“选民”。而反映这种思想的表现之一，就是所谓“天才教育”。在清华过去的教育里，很多系是走了“天才教育”的路线；只注意少数“天才”，而不注意一般人才的培养。就以我所熟知的数学系来做例证：系是成立了快二十年了，但从有系以来仅仅毕业了六十一个大学生和七个研究生。而这些毕业生中，受到特别关心的，更是少数中的少数。就设备说，难道我们只能培育这些吗？不，完全不！就需要说，难道社会上需要得并不殷切吗？也不然。但是由于传统的“天才教育”的错误看法，使自己未能发挥所有的力量。在蒋政权之下，我们且不去管它。但在今天，国家需要人才十分殷切的今天，我们就不能坦然置之不顾了！如果我们还是拘守着错误的“天才教育”政策，那我们就只能造就较少的人民干部，这就违背了全心全意为人民服务的原则了。
    这种“天才教育”、“选民教育”的方针，就引起了自高自大的错误想法。有一位朋友谈得好，在刚考上清华的一刹那，看见榜上有名的时候，自高自大之心便油然而生。因为投考清华是困难的，十中取一，百中选一，因之考取了就觉得高人一等了！并且在旧社会里，出洋是一切升官发财的阶梯，而清华毕业，便是出洋，所以在考取了的一刹那，就早已为未来的留洋梦所陶醉了，也就不自觉地走上了“清华第一，自高自大”的途径。“水木清华”的高楼大厦是举国无双的，玻璃书库，软木地板也是值得骄人的！老师们很少不是洋博士——因之也就是所谓的大师、大学问家。留洋回来那更不消说了！高高地在人民头上，青云得路！
    这种精神运用在工作岗位上，就觉得清华的毕业生是最好的。因之在用人行政的当儿，也就不自觉地补充了“清华人”。而反映在清华本身的就是不易广泛地吸收人才，并且偶被吸收进来的人才，虽然在清华工作多年，也时有作客之感！
    在今天这种自高自大的精神，妨碍了进步，显得十分严重：有些人怕为工农开门而降低素质，有些人怕大批招生而请不到“合格”的教员。更有些人反对办短期训练班，认为这将损害清华的金字招牌等等。总之，在今天清华自高自大的精神，已经和为人民服务的传统相违背，因而它完全是悖谬的了！如果我们不痛自悔改，就永远不会看到群众，更不必说到群众中去向群众学习了！
    现在再检查一下我们是如何教给我们的研究生及助教的。那可以说教给他们的完全是半殖民地式的研究。例如，我们所做的问题是取材于外国杂志的，方法也是因袭外人的，工作完成之后也寄往外国杂志，如能发表便沾沾自喜。这种作风影响之下，忘掉祖国，也忘掉人民建立自生自长的科学底要求。无怪乎在敌人封锁我们以后，有以下的这些怪论：“美国杂志不来，不能写东西了。”“没有外国杂志，如何做专题研究呢？”总之，我们所夸耀的所谓的“研究”是洋人头上的一朵花，它是既无根，又是旁人的装饰品（也许太推崇了）。
    以上这些是固有的病症，但到了今天，还未断根。在这次抗美援朝、镇压反革命、土地改革的热潮里，我们又暴露了不少思想问题，例如，在某重要会议席上，讨论签订爱国公约的时候，曾经有人提出检举藏在清华的反动地主一条，但结果竟被反对掉了！我们的政治学习——三大运动的学习，学到那儿去了！这一点起码的考验都不愿意接受，我们还能算做革命的干部，人民的教师吗？
    同时领导方面也有不少问题存在着：缺乏明确的思想领导，从来不对群众报告学校工作的具体方针路线；相反地，有时反而把没有成熟的计划，提到群众中来，搅动群众的情绪，浪费群众的时间，来讨论些纸上空谈。最具体的例证，就是今春所谓的“清华院系调整方案”——一个缺乏群众基础的方案，缺乏领导上热烈支持的方案。竟开了很多次会，把群众搅得天昏地暗，但结果是揠旗息鼓，无影无踪而逝。反而把搞好教研组的准备工作耽误下来了！这种志大才疏的计划，这类从清华本位出发的计划，又一度表现了“诚心诚意地，把清华完全地献给人民”的愿望是不够真诚的。
    当然清华并不是没有过光荣的。但是如果在改造期间仍念念不忘过去的光荣，那进步无疑地是较缓慢的。在现阶段——我们大家学习改造的阶段，还是先把过去的光荣的夸耀暂且收起吧！我们应当尽可能地发现自己的短处，而对症下药地校正自己的缺点。唯有如此，我们的改造才能彻底，我们才能更好地为人民服务。
    近几周来整个的清华园已经卷入了学习高潮，所有的工作人员都是如饥如渴地要求进步，这种气氛已经渗透到我们日常生活之中；近来我们的谈论中心也都集中到“怎样才可以把清华现有的力量，更有效地为人民服务”的问题上来。这无疑地是我们值得自慰的现象，对清华说是有划时代的意义的。并且一般都认识了，我们学校的进步，远远地落在各种建设之后。认识到我们不能以我们现在的教育方式——牛车的轮子，去配上飞速的经济建设——奔驰的列车。这种认识无疑地会促成政府合理化调整院系的。无怪乎在政府这一次宣布了北大清华院系调整方案之后，获得了我们一致的热烈拥护。但在将来实际执行这一计划的时候，以上所提的缺点，可能会影响到我们的计划的完善地完成。为了使我们的工作更有保证——实则将来的一切工作都在内，所以我大胆地提出了一些我们所具有的缺点，来就正于诸先进之前。
    感谢共产党，不但领导我们翻了身，而且介绍给我们布尔什维克的武器——批评及自我批评。虽然我还是小学生，在这儿第一次运用这武器来写作，但我学习运用这武器的决心是坚定的。因为初用，所以错误是不可免的，因为有决心，所以希望同志们用同样的武器来批评我。我真心诚意地等待着批评！
