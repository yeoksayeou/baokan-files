Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Tokyo Dispatch: Due to the increasing losses of the U.S. Air Force in the Korean battlefield, the U.S. aggressors are extremely alarmed and are now intensifying their search for former Japanese Air Force personnel to supplement their air force. U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Vandenberg, who arrived in Japan on November 9th, has ordered U.S. Far East Air Force Commander Weyland to quickly select 800 former Japanese Air Force pilots and mechanics to be incorporated into the active U.S. Air Force in Korea. Not long ago, Son Won-il, the naval chief of staff of the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, also scoured for many former Japanese Air Force pilots to go to South Korea.

At the same time, due to the serious losses of American aircraft on the Korean battlefield, the United States is also actively expanding aircraft production in Japan in an attempt to make up for the insufficient supply of American aircraft. According to a special report by Japan Truth on October 6th, Japan's aircraft industry is developing rapidly, "its main purpose being to compensate for the unexpectedly large consumption of American aircraft on the Korean battlefield." A survey team from the American Douglas Aircraft Company, led by former U.S. Air Force Undersecretary Stuart, came to Japan as early as September to investigate Japan's aircraft production capacity. In October, based on the results of the survey, they designated five companies, including Kawasaki Machinery Industry Co., Fuji Industries Co., and Central Japan Heavy Industries Co., to manufacture aircraft fuselages; four companies, including Central Japan Heavy Industries Co. and Fuji Industries Co., to manufacture aircraft engines; three companies, including Tokyo Shibaura Electric Co., to manufacture radio wave weapons; and thirteen companies, including Nippon Kogaku K.K., Hokushin Electric Works, and Yokogawa Electric Corporation, to manufacture aiming devices and other aircraft instruments.

    侵朝美国空军损失日益增加
    竟搜罗日本前空军人员补充
    并积极扩大日本的飞机生产
    【新华社十九日讯】东京消息：美国侵略者因美国空军在朝鲜战场上的损失日益增加，极感恐慌，现正加紧搜罗日本前空军人员补充其空军。十一月九日来日本的美国空军参谋长范顿伯，已命令美国远东空军司令威兰，尽速挑选前日本空军驾驶员及机械士八百名，以备编入在朝鲜的美国现役空军中。不久前，李承晚匪帮的伪海军参谋长孙元一，亦曾搜罗很多前日本空军的驾驶员到南朝鲜。
    同时，由于美国飞机在朝鲜战场上遭到严重损失，美国又在积极扩大日本的飞机生产，以图补充美机供应之不足。据十月六日日本真相特别通信称：日本飞机工业正急速发展，“其主要目的是弥补美国飞机在朝鲜战场上出乎意料之外的大量消耗。”由美国前空军次长司徒亚率领的美国道格拉斯飞机公司调查团，早在九月间即到日本调查日本的飞机生产能力，并在十月间就调查结果指定川崎机械工业公司、富士产业公司、中日本重工业公司等五家制造飞机机身，中日本重工业公司、富士产业公司等四家制造飞机引擎，东京芝浦电气公司等三家制造电波兵器，尚有日本光学工业公司、北辰精密工业公司、横河电机制造所等十三家制造瞄准器及其他飞机用仪器等。
