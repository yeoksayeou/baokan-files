Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch from Vienna: The World Peace Council Vienna Conference adopted the following "Letter to the United Nations and People of All Countries" on the 7th:

To the President of the United Nations General Assembly in Paris:

The World Peace Council, currently meeting in Vienna, hereby addresses the United Nations General Assembly, the media, and the people of the entire world:

The deterioration of the international situation in recent months has caused unease and anxiety among men and women of all countries. Everyone hopes that the five major powers will hold negotiations and conclude agreements, because, according to the terms of the United Nations Charter and according to their own strength, the five major powers bear the responsibility for maintaining world peace.

Therefore, the movement to conclude a Five-Power Peace Pact, requested by the World Peace Council, has been endorsed by world public opinion, which considers this movement correct in light of the development of events and the ineffectiveness of other current methods.

The World Peace Council requests the United Nations General Assembly to pay particular attention to the following:

(1) Peace and international cooperation cannot be achieved by forcing the entire world to accept decisions passed by a majority of member states, especially since most of these member states represent only a minority of mankind. Only through negotiation and reconciliation can agreements be established that are necessary for the development of world peace.

Since such agreements must be expanded, particularly to Asia, therefore, from the perspective of justice and the realities of international politics, the government of the People's Republic of China must be allowed to join the United Nations.

(2) The failure of the four-power foreign ministers' deputies meeting and the agreements reached at the seventh meeting of the Atlantic Treaty Council in Washington and Ottawa have made any disarmament action difficult, prevented the German people from deciding on the restoration of their unification, and increased the danger of war in Europe. Negotiations between the major powers can more quickly establish a unified, democratic, and de-militarized Germany. This solution is in line with the wishes of the majority of the German people, as well as the interests of Germany's neighbors, and the interests of peace.

Therefore, the World Peace Council calls on the United Nations to use its influence to ensure that international agreements on German disarmament are respected, and to facilitate the conclusion of a peace treaty that will enable the withdrawal of occupying forces and the reconstruction of a unified and de-militarized Germany.

(3) The restoration of peace in Asia is of concern to all mankind. The San Francisco Treaty with Japan seriously endangers the restoration of peace in Asia. To restore peace in Asia, it is not only necessary to end all ongoing hostilities, primarily the hostilities in Korea, by concluding an armistice agreement, but also to ensure the right of the peoples of Asian countries to independence and territorial integrity without foreign interference.

(4) Ensuring peace in the Middle East and North Africa cannot be satisfactorily achieved by continuing to maintain measures and situations that violate the people's right to self-determination. The right of the people of Egypt, Iran, Morocco, and all other countries in the Near East, Middle East, and North Africa to conduct and manage their own affairs without pressure from foreign interference or open or covert military occupation must be effectively recognized.

(5) The arms race will give the people nothing but the threat of war, which will cause destruction and harm to mankind. Therefore, the path of simultaneous, gradual, and effectively supervised disarmament must be followed. This disarmament must explicitly include the prohibition of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, the use of which is intolerable by universal moral standards.

The World Peace Council requests the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the disarmament proposal adopted in Vienna today (November 7, 1951). This proposal will not, in any way, create a situation of bias that is advantageous or disadvantageous to any one country. This proposal provides for a strict supervision system that can guarantee the security of all countries at every stage of disarmament.

The World Peace Council's disarmament proposal is attached to this document.

The World Peace Council is convinced that war is not inevitable, that peaceful coexistence of different political and social systems is possible, and that its proposals are in the interest of all mankind.

Mr. President, please accept our heartfelt respect.

### 世界和平理事会维也纳会议通过  告联合国与世界各国人民书

    世界和平理事会维也纳会议通过
    告联合国与世界各国人民书
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社维也纳讯：世界和平理事会维也纳会议七日通过告联合国与世界各国人民书如下：巴黎联合国大会主席：
    世界和平理事会正在维也纳开会，特致书联合国大会、舆论界和全世界的人民：
    最近几个月来，国际局势的恶化使得一切国家的男男女女都感到不安与焦虑。每一个人都希望五大国举行谈判并缔结协定，因为根据联合国宪章的条款和根据它们本身的力量，五大国负有维持世界和平的责任。
    因此，世界和平理事会要求缔结五大国和平公约的运动，受到了世界舆论的赞同，认为从事态的发展和目前其他方法没有效用的情形看来，这个运动是正确的。
    世界和平理事会要求联合国大会特别注意以下几项：
    （一）和平与国际合作，不是强使全世界接受多数会员国所通过的决定所能造成的，何况这些会员国大多数都只代表人类的少数。只有谈判与和解的办法才能成立世界和平发展所必须的协议。
    既然这种协议必须扩大，特别是扩大到亚洲，因此，从正义和国际政策的现实的观点看来，必须允许中华人民共和国政府加入联合国。
    （二）四国外长助理会议的失败以及大西洋公约理事会第七次会议在华盛顿与渥太华所获得的协议，使得一切裁减军备的行动发生困难，使得德国人民无法自行决定恢复他们的统一，并且增加欧洲的战争危险。大国之间举行谈判可以更迅速地建立统一、民主与肃清军国主义的德国。这种解决办法既符合德国大多数人民的愿望，同时又符合德国的邻国的利益，也符合和平的利益。
    因此，世界和平理事会要求联合国运用它的影响，使关于德国解除武装的各项国际协定受到尊重，并促成和约的缔结，这一和约必须能使占领军撤退，统一和肃清军国主义的德国得以重建。
    （三）恢复亚洲的和平，与全人类都有关系。旧金山对日和约严重危害了亚洲和平的恢复。恢复亚洲的和平，这不仅是说，一切正在进行的敌对行动，首先是在朝鲜的敌对行动，应以缔结停战协定而结束，而且也是说，亚洲各国人民不受外国的干涉而独立和领土完整的权利应得到保证。
    （四）要确保中东与北非的和平，不是继续保持违反人民自决权的措施与局势所能够圆满实现的。埃及、伊朗、摩洛哥以及近东、中东和北非所有其他国家的人民不受外国干涉的压力、不受公开的或隐秘的军事占领而进行与管理他们自己的事务的权利，必须以有效的方法予以承认。
    （五）军备竞赛不会给人民别的东西，它只会造成毁灭和祸害人类的战争威胁。因此，必须遵循同时、逐渐、并在有效监督之下裁减军备的道路。这种裁减军备必须明确地包括禁止原子武器和其他大规模毁灭的武器，这些武器的使用是普遍的道德标准所不容许的。世界和平理事会要求联合国大会把今天（一九五一年十一月七日）在维也纳通过的裁减军备建议加以讨论。这个建议，无论如何都不会造成对某一个国家有利或不利的偏畸的情况。这个建议规定有严格的监督制度，可以保证一切国家在裁减军备的每一阶段的安全。
    兹将世界和平理事会的裁减军备建议随同本文件附上。
    世界和平理事会深信，战争不是不可避免的，不同的政治与社会制度的和平共存是可能的，而且深信它的建议是符合全人类的利益的。
    主席先生，请接受我们衷心的敬意。
