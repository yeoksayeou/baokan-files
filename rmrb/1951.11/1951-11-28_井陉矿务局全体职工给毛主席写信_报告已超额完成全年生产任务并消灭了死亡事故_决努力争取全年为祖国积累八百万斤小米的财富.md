　　Respected Chairman Mao: Under the inspiration of your great spirit and your wise and correct leadership, all the staff of our Jingxing Mining Bureau have, on October 21st, victoriously completed the production task you assigned to us for the entire bureau in 1951, by overproducing 298.73 tons of coal. In the early shift of the 3rd of this month, we victoriously completed the production task set by the National Coal Mine Conference in August, exceeding the target by 470.80 tons. This is 21.51 percent higher than the production task of the same period in 1950. In terms of production efficiency, it also exceeded the original plan by 1.26 percent, an increase of 24 percent compared to 1950. In terms of safety, from January to October this year, we have achieved the elimination of fatal accidents. Minor and major work-related injuries have decreased by 86.55 percent compared to the same period in 1950, and the injury rate per 10,000 tons has decreased by 90.05 percent. In terms of cost, the cost per ton of coal was reduced by 12 percent compared to the plan, saving the state 7.66 million jin of millet. In terms of increased production and donations, we each donated an average of 20 workdays, and by the end of last month, we had fully paid the donation for a "Jingxing Mining Area" fighter plane. Now, all of our employees, in response to your call to continue strengthening the work of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, increasing production, and practicing strict economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers, are continuously creating new production achievements with a high degree of patriotic and internationalist production enthusiasm. For example, Group 206 in the second mine's underground created a new record of 27.2 meters of maximum tunneling on the 1st of this month. Since this month, the production situation in the second mine has gradually improved, with the highest output exceeding the original plan by 67.91 percent and efficiency increasing by 82.61 percent. The Jia Maishou group in the third mine has created a new record of safe production for 47 months and 15 days since November 1947. We are determined to consolidate and promote these achievements already made, and on the basis of continuing to implement the economic accounting system and saving costs, strive to accumulate wealth equivalent to eight million jin of millet for the motherland throughout the year, and strive to enhance the strength of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and national defense economic construction!
