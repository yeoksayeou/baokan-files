Beijing Municipal People's Government Construction Bureau's Inspection Report on Basic Construction Projects

Due to the correct leadership of higher authorities and the efforts of the vast number of cadres, Beijing's road and garden projects have achieved remarkable results. However, serious shortcomings have also occurred in our work. After the Government Administration Council's Financial and Economic Committee issued the "Notice on Strictly Inspecting Basic Construction Projects" on June 19, this bureau successively received instructions on project inspection from the leaders of the municipal government and the municipal government's Financial and Economic Committee. Starting from July 21, cadres of this bureau began to study the documents, formulate inspection plans, and were organized into four groups – roads, bridges and culverts, gardens, and production construction – to conduct key inspections separately, which yielded great results. The inspection situation is reported as follows.

	I. Planning Aspects

	(1) Individual project plans failed to fully implement the spirit of "first popularizing then improving" and "serving the working people," leading to serious waste when correcting deviations. For example, in the Yongdingmen Outer Bridge project, we initially wanted to build a permanent bridge. Due to the urgency of the construction period, the design was not fully completed before excavation began. However, the special funds for improving transportation projects had not been approved by higher authorities, and the hydrological data was not accurate. Therefore, building a permanent bridge encountered major difficulties. At this time, it was decided to use the above-mentioned funds to open a gap and build upper and lower stone ballast roads and two temporary wooden bridges to solve the actual problems of the masses. Although the policy error was corrected, it disrupted the construction steps and affected the construction period. Due to the change in the bridge position, more than 400 cubic meters of earthwork that had already been excavated for the foundation needed to be backfilled, wasting more than 300 workdays.

	(2) Lack of thorough planning, failure to estimate subjective forces, and failure to proceed steadily. For example, the quarry invested 2 million catties of millet, but there was no good plan beforehand, and as a result, some excavators were purchased but could not be used for a while. The plan was originally approved at the end of 1950, preparing to use wind drills to open the mountain at the site, and the equipment was purchased early, but limited by manpower, it was not officially put into production until now. This has resulted in the accumulation of funds and serious waste. Another example is the brick kiln factory, which originally planned to expand production. When ordering brick-making machines and building rotary kilns, there was no overall plan, and additions were made as work progressed. The original budget was 500 million yuan, but when the construction was completed, the expenditure reached 2.2 billion yuan. Although profits were made and the achievements were great, this approach was risky and caused some difficulties and losses to the work.

	(3) Lack of initiative in work. The annual engineering plan was decided too late, so there was no way to prepare special projects, which is a fact. However, we lacked initiative in our work and did not work hard enough. As a result, the design was not grasped tightly, materials were not prepared in advance, and the construction plan was not deployed early. The result was that the design could not keep up with the construction, the supply of materials was not timely, and the construction program was changed repeatedly, resulting in a chaotic state of construction in the first half of the year.

	II. Design Aspects

	(1) Lack of investigation and research, impractical design, blind construction, and repeated changes to the plan, resulting in waste. For example, the road project in Zhongnanhai was originally designed according to a soft subgrade. After construction, the plan was temporarily changed only after a lot of solid gray soil foundation was excavated. The Yuji Road and Yixiang Convenient Road bridges and culverts were not drilled beforehand, and it was only during construction that it was discovered that the actual situation was completely opposite to what was thought during design. We originally thought that the Yuji Road bridges and culverts needed to increase foundation piles, but we encountered quicksand.

	(2) Careless and sloppy work, lack of a serious sense of responsibility to the people. For example, the Yongdingmen West Wooden Bridge copied the old design drawings without verification, so after it was completed, it vibrated greatly and could not be used, so it had to be reinforced again. In the design of the South Xinhua Street project, the original road surface was raised, but the sidewalks were neglected, so that the drainage problems of some residents could not be solved. In the budget of the South Shuncheng Street project, the earthwork was underestimated and the transportation cost was omitted. The budget for the Qihe Lou project did not include roadbed work. These designs, although reviewed several times, did not find any errors. Most of the garden projects lacked explanations in their designs. Therefore, the foundation for planting trees and laying turf near Chongwenmen was treated the same, with 50 centimeters of soil being replaced, wasting about 1.5 million yuan. When the machinery factory undertook the production of iron splints, it lost the original drawings and redrew new drawings based on remembered dimensions. As a result, the drilling position was wrong, and it was only discovered after it was completed, forcing rework, wasting about 2 million yuan in electricity and labor.

	III. Construction Aspects

	(1) This year, there were very few cases of construction without design in new projects. However, there have been cases of construction without design in some maintenance and improvement projects. For example, the reinforcement project of the inspection section wooden bridge was considered to be just maintenance, so there was no design, and it was not known how much the piles should bear or how long they should be. When replacing rotten wooden piles and driving new piles, some piles were not good and broke as soon as they were driven; some could still be driven down, but because they were afraid of not being long enough, they were unwilling to drive them further. Some cadres thought that since the public lumberyard supplied the materials anyway, they thought the more solid the better. But is this project safe? Is it wasteful? They had no idea. In addition, there were individual projects that started construction before all the designs were sent to the construction department for fear of idling, resulting in losses. For example, the South Shuncheng Street project should have had 3,800 cubic meters of abandoned soil, but because they did not understand the design situation, they mistakenly thought that there was a shortage of soil and rashly transported 200 cubic meters of slag soil from Chongnei, losing 6 million yuan in transportation costs.

	(2) There is a simple task-oriented viewpoint in construction, emphasizing quantity over quality, neglecting inspection, and thus causing losses. In 1950, from the leading cadres to the construction site cadres of this bureau, they all attached importance to oil roads and cement roads, and did not care much about medium and low-grade road surfaces. The most typical example is the Huashi Street stone ballast road project. When this road was under construction, the leading cadres thought there was no problem, so they did not inspect it; the construction site cadres were busy rushing to work before the New Year and were perfunctory; the leading cadres also thought that this saved on rolling work. As a result, within a month, most of the road surface was loose, and part of the roadbed sank. Subsequent repairs resulted in a loss of 42 million yuan in labor and material costs. Another example is when planting trees on the eastern section of the Lin Yin Avenue, 323 poplar seedlings were purchased from other places and rushed to be planted, neglecting to check the quality, and 83 died, resulting in a loss of 2 million yuan. These facts of neglecting project quality in order to catch up with tasks not only waste the state and people's financial resources, but also damage the political influence of the People's Government.

	(3) The connection and cooperation between units are not enough, and there is still the ideology and style of departmentalism, which causes losses in construction. For example, the designer of the Yuji Road bridge foundation project stated in the instructions: "After excavating the foundation, if necessary, foundation piles can be added according to the prescribed method." They thought this was clearly explained. The builders followed the drawings and saw that there were piles on the drawings, so they naturally drove them, and no one took the initiative to find anyone to study. The designer originally had no grasp of the foundation situation, but did not go to check; the builder found that the foundation was good enough, but did not stop driving the piles. In addition, some projects were not completely carried out according to the original design by the builders, and they did not study with the original designer beforehand. When constructing the Shuncheng Street Road, the layered compaction of the road surface and the amount of oil used did not meet the original design. The South Shuncheng Street asphalt road was completed by two construction units in cooperation. These two units had a phenomenon of robbing materials. The Chongwenmen Garden Project and the Wengcheng Road Project were not closely coordinated. The area that should have been replaced with soil for planting trees was first filled with slag soil from the demolition of the city, resulting in the need to dig and fill again, wasting more than 50 workdays.

The reasons for these shortcomings and errors, we believe that there are indeed objective difficulties, such as insufficient mastery of design data, lack of cadres and technicians, and insufficient experience, too few mechanical equipment, and too large and urgent temporary tasks, but it should be pointed out that insufficient subjective efforts are the main reason.

	I. The bureaucracy and preoccupation with routine of leading cadres seriously hinder the work. We are often busy completing tasks, making more arrangements and less inspections; solving the difficulties below is not timely or helpful enough; we do not deeply understand the policies and guidelines stipulated by the higher authorities; we cannot well implement ideological education among cadres; we have not been able to help and correct the simple task-oriented viewpoint, simple technical viewpoint, masterpiece thinking, departmentalism and other deviations in the work of some cadres in a timely manner.

	II. We have not clearly realized that errors and shortcomings in basic construction will seriously waste state wealth. We have not highly developed the spirit of being responsible to the people, and have not paid attention to saving every bit of wealth for the people in the project. Therefore, some comrades do not conduct serious investigations and research when designing projects, and are not patient with careful calculations; some comrades neglect inspections during construction, and do not calculate enough how to use funds to maximize the engineering effect.

	III. We do not demand enough of our work, are satisfied with completing huge engineering figures, are satisfied with local achievements, and relax our careful study of our work. Therefore, we have not yet well established the necessary specifications, standards and sound systems in construction specifications, material standards, and planning, design, construction, equipment, and financial management. Some systems have been established, but due to insufficient ideological attention, they cannot be well implemented.

	IV. Our thinking methods and working methods also have problems. We do not consider issues comprehensively, and we do not analyze clearly the main factors controlling the design during design. In our work, there is a style of empiricism, ignoring the necessary planning. Some have a simple technical viewpoint, denying or ignoring the truth that the engineering effect should effectively meet the most urgent needs of the masses. Some have a phenomenon of disconnection between theory and practice, and have not well combined science and technology with the actual experience of the workers.

After this inspection, we believe that in addition to deeply reviewing the errors, shortcomings and their roots in past work, criticizing and correcting the so-called "Chen Yougong's thinking" that emphasized objective difficulties in the past, we also plan to continue discussions among cadres, launch criticism and self-criticism, seriously summarize work experience, and formulate practical and feasible methods to improve work. At the same time, we must work hard to study and improve our political and professional levels, so as to better build the people's capital and serve the working people of the capital.

    北京市人民政府建设局关于基本建设工程的检查报告
    北京市的道路和园林工程，由于上级的正确领导和广大干部的努力，已经获得很显著的成绩。但是，在我们的工作中，也曾发生过严重的缺点。政务院财政经济委员会六月十九日关于严格检查基本建设工程的通知发布后，本局先后奉到市府首长和市府财政经济委员会关于工程检查的指示。从七月二十一日起，本局所属干部，即开始学习文件，拟定检查计划，并编为道路、桥涵、园林和生产建设四个小组，分别进行重点检查，收获很大。兹将检查情况报告如次。
        一、计划方面
    （一）个别工程计划，未能完全贯彻“先普及后提高”“为劳动人民服务”的精神，致在纠正偏差时，发生严重浪费。例如，永定门外桥梁工程，我们最初一心想做永久式的。因工期急迫，设计尚未全部完成，即行刨槽；但改善交通工程专款，并未经上级核准，水文资料又欠确实，因此，修建永久式桥梁，发生重大困难。这时才决定以上项工款，开辟豁口，修筑上下行石碴路，和两座临时性木桥，以解决群众的实际问题。这样，政策的错误虽然得到纠正，但是打乱了工程步骤，影响了工期。由于桥位变动，已经挖好的基础四百多土方，需要回填，浪费了三百多个工力。
    （二）缺乏周密计划，未估计主观力量，没有稳步前进。例如，采石厂投资二百万斤小米，事先没有很好计划，结果买了一些挖土机，一时使用不上。该计划原在一九五○年年底批准，准备在山场利用风钻开山，设备早经购齐，但限于人力，直到现在才正式生产。这样便积压了资金，造成严重浪费。又如砖窑厂原计划扩大生产，订购制砖机和修建转盘窑时，没有全盘计划，随作随添。原预算五亿元，待建设完成时，开支到二十二亿元。虽然取得了利润，成绩也很大，但这种作法是冒险的，并且曾给工作带来了一些困难与损失。
    （三）工作缺乏主动性。年度工程计划决定太晚，专款工程就无从准备，这是事实；但我们在工作中缺乏主动性，也不够努力，因而设计抓得不紧，器材没有预为准备，施工计划未能及早部署，结果设计赶不上施工，器材供应也不及时，施工程序一再变动，致上半年工程陷于忙乱状态。
        二、设计方面
    （一）缺乏调查研究，设计不切实际，盲目施工，一再变动计划，造成浪费。例如，中南海内道路工程，原是按照软路基设计的。施工以后，直到挖出很多坚实灰土基础时，才临时改变计划。玉机路和颐香便道桥涵，事先没有经过钻探，到施工时，才发现实际情况和设计时的想法完全相反。我们原认为玉机路桥涵需要增加基桩，但却遇见了流沙。
    （二）工作粗枝大叶，马虎草率，缺乏严肃的对人民负责的责任心。例如，永定门西木桥，照抄了旧时的设计图样，也没有核算，以致修竣之后，颠动很大，无法通行，乃不得不再行加固。南新华街工程设计中，加高了原路面，忽略了步道，致使部分住户的排水问题不能解决。南顺城街工程预算中，少估了土方，漏列了运费。骑河楼工程预算未列路床工等。这些设计，虽经过几次复核，都没有发觉其中有错。园林工程的设计，多数缺乏说明，因此，把崇文门附近的植树和铺草皮的基础一律看待，换土都在五十公分，浪费约一百五十万元。机械厂在承制铁夹板时，丢了原来的图样，凭着记忆的尺寸重画新图，结果钻孔位置错了，做完了才发觉，被迫返工，浪费电力人工约二百万元。
        三、施工方面
    （一）今年在新工方面，没有设计就施工的情形是很少的。但是若干保养改善工程，则发生过没有设计就施工的现象。例如，检车段木桥加固工程，认为仅仅是保养，就没有设计，不知道桩子应该承重多少，应该有多长。在抽换腐朽木桩，加打新桩时，有的桩子不好，一打就断；有的还可以打下去，但因为怕不够长，就不愿再打。有些干部认为反正是公家木厂供给材料，因此就存在着越坚固越好的想法。但这工程是否安全呢？是否浪费呢？却是心中无数的。此外，还有个别工程，没等全部设计送达施工部门，因为怕窝工，就先行开工，造成损失。例如，南顺城街工程，本应有弃土三千八百方，但因不了解设计情况，以为缺土，冒然从崇内运来二百方碴土，损失运费六百万元。
    （二）施工中存在着单纯任务观点，重量不重质，疏于检查，因而造成损失。一九五零年，本局从领导干部到工地干部，都重视油路、洋灰路，对中低级路面是不很关心的。最典型的例子是花市大街石碴路工程。该路施工时，领导干部认为没有什么问题，就不去检查；工地干部忙着赶工过年，草率了事；领导干部还认为这是节省了碾工。结果，不到一个月，大部路面松散，部分路基下沉，事后补修，损失工料费四千二百万元。又如林荫大道东段植树时，由外地购来毛白杨苗木三二三株，赶着栽种，疏于检查品质，死亡八十三株，损失达二百万元。这些为赶任务而忽略工程质量的事实，不但浪费国家人民的财力，而且损害了人民政府的政治影响。
    （三）各单位连系配合不够，还存在着本位主义的思想和作风，因而在施工中造成损失。例如，玉机路桥基工程的设计者，在说明书里注明：“刨开基础后，必要时可照规定办法，加打基桩”。他们认为这就交代清楚了。施工者照图施工，看明图上有桩，当然照打，谁也不主动找谁去研究。设计者对基础情况原无把握，但不去查看；施工者发现基础够好，但没有停止打桩。此外，有些工程，施工者没有完全照原设计去做，事先也没有和原设计者研究。在顺城街路施工时，路面的分层碾压和用油数量，都不合原设计。南顺城街沥青路，是由两个施工单位配合完成的。这两个单位曾发生抢料现象。崇文门园林工程和瓮城道路工程，没有密切配合，本来应该换土种树的地方，却先填上了拆城的碴土，结果需要再挖再填，浪费五十余工。
    产生以上这些缺点和错误的原因，我们认为客观上确有困难，如设计资料掌握不够，干部和技工缺乏，而且经验不足，机械设备太少，临时任务太大太急等，但应该指出，主观努力不够还是主要的。
    一、领导干部的官僚主义和事务主义作风，严重地妨害了工作。我们经常忙于完成任务，布置多，检查少；对下面的困难解决得不及时或帮助不够；对上级规定的政策方针体会不深；在干部中不能很好贯彻思想教育；对某些干部存在的单纯任务观点、单纯技术观点、杰作思想、本位主义和工作上其他的偏向，未能在工作中及时帮助，予以纠正。
    二、我们还没有明确地认识在基本建设上发生错误和缺点，会严重地浪费国家财富。我们还没有高度发挥对人民负责的精神，还没有注意到应在工程中，为人民节约一点一滴的财富。因此，有些同志在设计工程时，不认真进行调查研究，不耐烦精打细算；有些同志在施工时，疏于检查，对如何使用工款才能发挥最大的工程效果，也核算不够。
    三、我们对自己的工作要求还不够高，满足于完成庞大的工程数字，满足于局部成绩，放松了对工作的细心钻研，因此，在施工规范上，在工料标准上，在计划、设计、施工、器材和财务管理方面，都还没有很好地树立必要的规格、标准和健全的制度。有些制度虽已建立，也由于思想上不够重视，不能很好地贯彻执行。
    四、我们的思想方法和工作方法也有毛病，考虑问题不全面，设计时没有把控制设计的主要因素分析清楚。我们在工作中，存在着经验主义的作风，忽视了必要的计划性。有的存在着单纯技术观点，否认了或忽视了工程效果应该有效地满足群众最迫切的需要的道理。有的存在着理论与实践脱节的现象，没有很好地把科学技术与工人群众的实际经验结合起来。
    经过这次检查，我们认为，除了应该深刻检讨过去工作中的错误、缺点及其根源，批判与纠正过去强调客观困难的所谓“陈有功思想”外，并拟在干部中继续进行讨论，展开批评与自我批评，认真总结工作经验，拟定切实可行的改进工作的办法。同时要努力学习，提高政治水平和业务水平，以便更好地建设人民的首都，为首都的劳动人民服务。
