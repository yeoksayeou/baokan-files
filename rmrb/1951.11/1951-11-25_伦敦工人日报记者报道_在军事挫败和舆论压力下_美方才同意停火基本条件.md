London "Workers' Daily" Reporter Reports
Under Military Defeats and Public Opinion Pressure
U.S. Side Finally Agreed to Basic Ceasefire Conditions

[Xinhua News Agency, 25th] Alan Winnington, a reporter for the London "Workers' Daily," reported from Panmunjom on the 23rd: If the staff officers here can quickly reach an agreement on the line of contact, allowing the subcommittee to resolve it on the 24th, then the second item on the agenda can probably be resolved at the plenary session of delegates on the 25th. This is the situation after the two sides' subcommittee reached an agreement today on the principle of determining the ceasefire line. Today, the U.S. side accepted the Korean-Chinese side's revision of the third point in their draft agreement, and the two sides' subcommittee reached an agreement on the principle of determining the ceasefire line. In this way, after an unusually rare four months of negotiations in history, the most crucial item on the agenda has actually been resolved. During these four months, the U.S. side was unable to achieve its goals by force, but used the method of creating incidents to drag out the negotiations for two months. In other respects, they put forward a series of unacceptable demands to delay reaching an agreement, but the things demanded could not but become less and less. Initially, they demanded more than 12,000 square kilometers of North Korean territory north of the front line, then they demanded 1,000 square kilometers of territory including Kaesong, and later they demanded that the front line be used as the dividing line, occupying Kaesong for nothing. Frustrated in this regard, they tried to undermine the agenda and delay dealing with the whole issue until the end of the negotiations. Their last trick played yesterday (22nd) was to delay resolving this agenda item for another thirty days. Today (23rd) they accepted the revised proposal. U.S. press officer Nokes tried to deceive people by saying that this was the goal that the U.S. side had been hoping to achieve since July. The fact is that they finally agreed to something they had previously pretended to approve of but never actually wanted to accept. The reason why they are now willing to determine this basic ceasefire condition is due to their military defeats on the front lines, the pressure of public opinion, and the firmness and ingenuity of the Korean-Chinese negotiators - the Korean-Chinese representatives calmly did not fall for the U.S. side's provocations and tricks, and insisted on the principles of the agenda that the U.S. side was trying to undermine. Regardless of what happens on the front lines, the line of contact drawn on the map in this cold and windy village at this moment is valid within thirty days. The Korean-Chinese side has made it clear that as long as the United States is sincere, negotiations can be completed within thirty days. In this way, British troops, even if they cannot go home for Christmas, can spend a peaceful Christmas, and their relatives and friends in Britain can also spend the holidays in peace. When the two delegations move on to discuss the next few items on the agenda, it will soon become clear whether the United States is finally determined to bring about peace here quickly.

    在军事挫败和舆论压力下
    美方才同意停火基本条件
     【新华社二十五日讯】伦敦工人日报记者阿兰·魏宁顿二十三日自板门店报道说：如果此间参谋人员能够很快在接触线方面取得协议，让小组委员会在二十四日加以解决，那末第二项议程大概可以在二十五日的全体代表团会议上得到解决。这就是今天双方小组委员会对确定停火线的原则取得协议以后的情况。今天美方接受朝中方面对他们的协议草案中的第三点的修正，双方小组委员会就在确定停火线的原则方面取得协议。这样一来，经过历史上异常少有的历时四个月的谈判以后，最关重要的一项议程实际上已解决了。在这四个月当中，美方没有能够用武力达到他们的目的，但却用制造事件的办法把谈判拖了两个月的时间。在其他方面，他们提出一连串不能使人接受的要求，以拖延达成协议的时间，不过，所要求的东西却不能不愈来愈少。最初，他们要求取得战线以北的北朝鲜的一万二千多方公里土地，接着，要求取得包括开城在内的一千方公里土地，后来，他们要求以战线作为分界线，白白占领开城。由于在这方面受到挫折，他们又想破坏议程，把整个这个问题拖到谈判结束时处理。他们在昨天（二十二日）耍的最后一着是把这项议程拖到三十天以后再解决。今天（二十三日）他们接受修正的建议。美方新闻发布官纳科斯企图骗人说这是美方从七月以来一直希望达到的目标。事实是他们最后方同意他们以前假装赞成而实际上从来不愿意接受的东西。他们现在之所以愿意确定这个基本的停火条件，是由于他们在前线上的军事挫败、舆论的压力和朝中谈判代表的坚定和机智——朝中代表冷静地不因美方的挑衅和诡计而上当，坚持美方企图破坏的议程原则。不管前线上发生什么情况，此刻在这个冷风飕飕的村庄里画在地图上的接触线在三十天以内是有效的。朝中方面已经明白表示，只要美国有诚意，谈判是可以在三十天以内完成的。这样一来，英国军队即使不能回家过圣诞节，也可以过一个和平的圣诞节，同时他们在英国的亲友也可以安心过节了。当双方代表团进而讨论下几项议程时，不久就可以看出美国是否终于决心很快促成这里的和平。
