The new medical education system has been widely implemented across the country. This new system was determined at the First National Health Conference in August of last year. The new system divides the training of health workers into three levels: higher, intermediate, and primary. The teaching method employs a discipline-focused system combined with practical teaching methods that integrate listening, observing, and doing. After a year of widespread implementation nationwide, it has proven to be very suitable for China's current practical needs.

The old medical system in China, directly and indirectly influenced by several imperialist countries, lacked uniformity in curriculum, duration of studies, and teaching methods, and was far from meeting practical needs. In terms of quantity, from the time Li Hongzhang established the Beiyang Medical College in Tianjin in 1881 to 1949, only 38 higher medical colleges and schools were established nationwide, producing just over 16,000 doctors. Calculating on the basis of one doctor needed for every thousand people, the country required more than 475,000 doctors. In terms of quantity alone, the doctors trained by the old medical system were far from meeting the needs of the people.

The significant characteristic of the new medical education system is that it abandons the pre-graduation undifferentiated approach in higher medical education and adopts a discipline-focused system, shortening the duration of studies. Internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology are all changed to a five-year system (including the final year of internship); public health, stomatology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, and pharmacy are changed to a four-year system (including internship). The discipline-focused system provides appropriate specialized education based on a systematic scientific knowledge. The curriculum is divided into principal and auxiliary subjects. The content of basic courses and clinical teaching is subject to practical needs. In this way, each student is able to independently undertake various specialized health care work after graduation. The discipline-focused system was first implemented in medical colleges and schools in the Northeast, and is currently being adopted by Zhejiang University, Northwest University, Hebei University, Shanxi University, and Shandong Medical College. Over the past year, 95 percent of the 41 medical colleges and schools nationwide have shortened the duration of studies, increased faculty and equipment, and expanded enrollment. This year, the number of medical college and school students nationwide is 19,770 (not including the military system), exceeding the total number of doctors trained in the past 69 years. Compared with the total number of students enrolled in 1945 (more than 8,600) during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, this represents an increase of 129 percent.

The current primary task of medical education is to develop intermediate medical education, with the aim of training a large number of intermediate-level health cadres who can independently handle general healthcare, epidemic prevention, medical treatment, and pharmaceutical preparation, and can also serve as good assistants to specialized technical personnel in various departments. Intermediate medical education is mainly focused on medical assistant education, enrolling junior high school graduates with a study period of two years in principle. If the number of junior high school graduates is insufficient, elementary school graduates are also enrolled, extending the study period with a consistent system. The content of the curriculum focuses on health care and epidemic prevention, supplemented by treatment. Medical assistant schools in areas with severe endemic diseases focus their curriculum on the prevention and treatment of prevalent diseases in those areas. According to statistics from the end of last year, there were 23 medical assistant schools and medical assistant departments of health schools nationwide (with more than 2,600 students), but by the first half of this year, this had increased to more than 90, with more than 8,400 students. In the past year, various regions have created some good experiences in medical assistant education, such as the Northeast's improvements in educational organization and methods, the Central South's rapid and solid development of medical assistant education, and East China's creation of teaching materials. The old and newly added midwifery schools and nursing schools have also been shortened from three years to two years, the qualification for admission has been changed to junior high school graduation, high school students are no longer recruited, and enrollment quotas are expanded as much as possible. Other intermediate-level technical personnel schools for pharmacists, inspectors, vital statisticians, and environmental sanitation workers have also stipulated study periods of six months to two years, depending on the nature of the discipline. The Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government also convened a National Intermediate Health Education Conference in September of this year, making unified and specific decisions on the academic system, curriculum, teaching materials, staffing, equipment, student further studies, and teacher training for intermediate education.

Primary health education has also made considerable progress in the past year. After short-term training, maternal and child health workers (training period of six months) and village health workers (training period of three months) have become an important force in popularizing health work in the vast rural areas. The training of primary health personnel is generally the responsibility of county health centers; the training of nurse assistants (training period of six months) is jointly undertaken by nursing schools or hospitals. According to statistics from the first half of this year, more than 26,000 maternal and child health workers have been trained (including continuing education for some midwives), and more than 10,000 nurse assistants have been trained. More than 70,000 old midwives have been trained and reformed in the past year.

    全国推行新医学教育制度获得成绩
    今年全国医学校就学者超过已往六十九年所训练的医生总数
    新医学教育制度已在全国普遍推行。新医学教育制度是去年八月第一届全国卫生会议确定的。新医学教育制度把培养卫生工作人员分为高、中、初三级；教学方法是采用分科重点制和听、看、做合一的实际教学法。经过一年来在全国普遍推行的结果，证明了这种制度很切合中国目前的实际需要。
    旧中国的医学制度因为直接和间接受着好几个帝国主义国家的影响，在课程、年限和教学方法上都不统一，更不切合实际的需要。就数量上来说自一八八一年李鸿章在天津开办北洋医学院起到一九四九年止的六十九年间，全国先后成立的高等医学院、校只有三十八所，造就的医生，不过一万六千多人。如以一千人需要一个医生计算，全国需要四十七万五千多医生。仅就数量来说，旧医学制度所造就的医生远不能满足人民的需要。
    新医学教育制度的显著特点，是在高级医学教育中废弃毕业前不分科的办法，而采取分科重点制，并缩短学习年限。内科、外科、小儿科、妇产科等均改为五年制（包括最后一年的实习）；公共卫生、口腔、眼、耳鼻喉和药学等科改为四年制（包括实习）。分科重点制是在有系统的科学知识基础上予以适当的专门教育。课程分为主科与辅科。基础课程和临床教学的内容，都服从实际的需要。这样，就使每个学生在毕业后，都能独立担任各种专门性的卫生医疗工作。分科重点制首先在东北各医学院、校推行，目前浙江大学、西北大学、河北大学、山西大学等校和山东医学院等都已采用。一年来，全国四十一所医学院、校中有百分之九十五缩短了学习年限，增加师资、设备，扩大了招生人数。今年全国在校的医学院、校学生数为一万九千七百七十人（军队系统的不在内），超过了过去六十九年来所训练出来的医生总数，比较国民党反动统治时期一九四五年在校学生总额（八千六百多人），则增加了百分之一百二十九。
    医学教育目前以发展中级医学教育为主要任务，目的在于训练大批中级卫生干部，使他们既能独立地处理一般保健、防疫、医疗和药剂配备的问题，又可以成为各科专门技术人员的良好助手。中级医学教育以医士教育为主，招收初中毕业生，修业期以两年为原则。如因初中毕业生人数不足，也招收小学毕业生，用一贯制延长修业年限。课程内容，以保健防疫为主，治疗为辅。有严重地方病流行地区的医士学校，其课程即着重该地区的流行疾病的防治。截至去年年底的统计，全国医士学校和卫生学校的医士科，共有二十三所（学生两千六百多人），但到今年上半年已增加到九十余所，现有学生八千四百余人。各地在一年来的医士教育工作中，已创造了一些良好的经验，如东北对教育组织与教育方法的改进，中南迅速踏实的开展医士教育，华东的教材创造等。旧有的和新增的助产学校和护士学校，也都从三年缩为二年，投考资格改为初中毕业，不再招收高中生，并尽量扩大招生名额。其他药剂员、检验员、生命统计员、环境卫生员等中级技术人员学校，也都根据学科性质，分别规定学习期限为六个月至二年。中央人民政府卫生部并于今年九月召开了全国中级卫生教育会议，对中级教育的学制、课程、教材、编制、设备、学生进修、师资培养等作了统一和具体的决定。
    初级卫生教育，一年来也有相当的发展。经过短期训练的妇幼保健员（训练期间六个月）、村卫生员（训练期间三个月）已成为广大农村普及卫生工作的重要力量。初级卫生人员的训练工作，一般由县卫生院负责；护士助理员（训练期间六个月）的训练，由护士学校或医院兼办。据今年上半年的统计，已训练的妇幼保健员有二万六千多人（包括了一部分接生员的继续进修）、护士助理员一万余人。一年来已训练改造旧接生婆七万多名。
