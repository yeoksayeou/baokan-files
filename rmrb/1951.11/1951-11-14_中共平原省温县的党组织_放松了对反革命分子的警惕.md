The Party Organization of Wen County, Pingyuan Province
    Relaxed its Vigilance Against Counter-Revolutionaries
    Due to the bureaucratic work style of the leading cadres of the Party in Wen County, Pingyuan Province, class alien element Li Dongtang took the opportunity to infiltrate the Party and carry out various acts of sabotage, seriously damaging the Party's prestige among the masses. Li Dongtang was from Xiaojinxiang Village. During the land reform, he concealed his counter-revolutionary history, feigned progress, infiltrated our Party, and was elected as the Secretary of the Xiaojinxiang Village Branch of the Chinese Communist Party. For two years, Li Dongtang embezzled from the fruits of struggle, public land rent, government cotton loans, loans, and wages for the masses repairing rivers, totaling more than 6,200 catties of grain. In addition, he embezzled three public waterwheels, three horse-drawn carts, and seized farmer Wu Zhongren's mule. Li Dongtang also raped women and beat and scolded the masses. Fifteen people in the village were beaten. For example, Zhao Shengquan, the chairman of the village people's representative conference, was allocated two mu of landlord's land during the land reform. Li Dongtang asked Zhao Shengquan to return the land to the landlord. When Zhao refused, Li beat him on the pretext of being late for a meeting. Later, he ordered militiaman Fa Wang to beat him, but Fa Wang refused and was also beaten by Li. When Wu Jucai from the village got married, Li Dongtang took off the bride's shoes as soon as she got off the sedan chair and made many extremely lewd gestures. An old lady nearby couldn't stand it and said, "What are young people doing!" Li beat the old lady on the spot. The masses and cadres in the village were extremely dissatisfied with Li Dongtang's behavior, but they were afraid to speak out. Recently, after the masses reported to the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Wen County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, class alien element Li Dongtang was expelled from the Party and sent to the People's Government for punishment according to the law. I suggest that the responsible comrades of the Party in various places should frequently go deep into the masses and listen to their opinions so that such bad elements cannot exist within the Party.

　　中共平原省温县的党组织
    放松了对反革命分子的警惕
    由于平原省温县党的领导干部存在着官僚主义作风，致使阶级异己分子李东堂乘机混入党内，进行各种破坏，严重地损害了党在群众中的威信。李东堂是小金香村人，在土地改革中隐瞒了自己的反革命历史，伪装进步，混入我党，并被选为中共小金香村支部书记。两年来李东堂从斗争果实、公地地租、政府贷棉、贷款、群众修河工资等方面进行贪污，共折合粮食六千二百余斤。此外他还贪污了公家三辆水车、三辆马车，霸占了农民武中仁的骡子。李东堂还强奸妇女、打骂群众，全村遭过毒打的就有十五人。如村人民代表会议主席赵生全在土地改革时分到地主土地二亩，李东堂让赵生全退地给地主，赵不答应，即被李藉口开会迟到而毒打一顿。后又令民兵发旺去打，发旺不肯亦被李毒打了一顿。该村吴聚才结婚时，新娘刚一下轿，李东堂就把她的鞋子脱了，并作出很多极下流的动作。旁边一个老太太看不过去说了一句：“年青人作些什么！”李当场将老太太毒打一顿。村中群众与干部对于李东堂的这种行为极为不满，但都敢怒而不敢言。最近群众向中共温县县委纪律检查委员会告发后，才把阶级异己分子李东堂开除出党，并送人民政府依法惩办。我建议各地党的负责同志，应经常深入群众，听取群众的意见，以使这样的坏分子不能在党内存身。　王金波　尚瑞南
