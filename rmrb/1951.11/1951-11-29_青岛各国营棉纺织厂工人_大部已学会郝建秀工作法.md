Qingdao's state-owned cotton textile factories' spinning workers, over the past three months, have diligently studied Hao Jianxiu's spinning method, reducing roller licker waste and increasing production, saving the country wealth worth 1.3 billion yuan. After the city's spinning workers' representative meeting in August, the city's spinning workers immediately plunged into a movement to learn Hao Jianxiu's work method. To date, approximately 95% of the city's spinning workers have become relatively proficient, and many workers have approached or even surpassed Hao Jianxiu's average roller licker waste rate of 0.25% over seven months. The average roller licker waste rate of state-owned cotton textile factories throughout the city has decreased to 0.816%, a 50.8% reduction compared to before the promotion. In September and October, 36 workers from the State-owned Qingdao No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory continuously produced less roller licker waste, breaking Hao Jianxiu's record. After learning Hao Jianxiu's work method, the workers in the spinning rooms of each factory greatly reduced the amount of coarse warp, coarse weft, and feathered yarn, thus lowering the rate of substandard cloth caused by poor yarn quality. In August, the rate of substandard cloth caused by poor yarn quality in the State-owned Qingdao No. 8 Cotton Textile Factory accounted for 2.408% of the total rate of substandard cloth, but it decreased to 1.853% in September. At the same time, due to the improved yarn quality, the work in the bobbin, reeling, and bale packaging workshops is not only easier than before, but also reduces the amount of waste cotton produced.

    青岛各国营棉纺织厂工人
    大部已学会郝建秀工作法
    青岛各国营棉纺织厂的细纱工友，三个月来努力学习郝建秀细纱工作法，减少了皮辊花，为国家增产节约了价值十三亿元的财富。八月间该市召开细纱职工代表会后，全市细纱工人，即投入了学习郝建秀工作法的运动中。至目前止，学习得比较熟练的工友已达全市细纱工人的百分之九十五左右，不少工友并且接近甚至超过了郝建秀七个月平均皮辊花率百分之零点二五的水平。全市各国营棉纺织厂的皮辊花率平均已降低至百分之零点八一六，较推广前降低了百分之五十点八。国营青岛第六棉纺织厂九、十两月份持续少出皮辊花打破郝建秀纪录者共三十六人。各厂细纱间工人学习了郝建秀工作法之后，粗经、粗纬、羽毛纱等坏纱大为减少，因而降低了因纱不好所造成的次布率。国营青岛第八棉纺织厂八月份因纱的质量过低造成的次布占总次布率的百分之二点四零八，九月份则减少至百分之一点八五三。同时，由于纱的品质提高，筒子、摇纱、成包车间的工作不仅比以前好做，而且也减少了回丝出数。　（本报综合）
