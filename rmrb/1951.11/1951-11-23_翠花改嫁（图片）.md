    Cuihua Remarries
    Fang Zengxian
    (4) After Cuihua heard about "freedom of marriage" in the women's association last year, she met the director of the women's association on the road one day and told her about her situation. The director of the women's association decided to inquire about Old Man Wang's opinion first.
    (5) Who knew the old man was very stubborn, saying, "Cuihua works hard; it's just that... she's a widow." He also said that there were many such things in the village, and it would cause trouble.
    (6) The director of the women's association couldn't get through his old brain, so she had to bring the matter to the farmers' association, but the farmers' association couldn't solve it at the time, so the matter was put on hold.

    翠花改嫁
    方增先
    （四）翠花去年在妇女会里听人家讲了“婚姻自由”以后，一天在路上碰到妇女会主任，便把自己的事情告诉了她。妇女会主任决定替她先探问一下王老头的意见。
    （五）谁知老头子很固执，说：“翠花劳动倒起劲；就是……是个寡妇。”并说，村里这样的事多了，会出乱子。
    （六）妇女会主任打不通他的老脑筋，只得把事情提到农会里去，但农会当时也没法解决，就把这事搁下来了。
