Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, November 24th: The Fourth Plenary Session of the Central South Military and Political Committee was held from the 12th to the 22nd. In accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, this meeting determined that increasing production, practicing strict economy, and continuing to carry out the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea; completing land reform; implementing democratic reforms; and carrying out ideological remolding movements should be the central tasks of the Central South region in the future. After careful discussions and research, the meeting formulated specific plans to advance these central tasks and made resolutions.

    Regarding increasing production and practicing economy, the meeting pointed out: Streamlining and economizing, opposing corruption and waste must be universally and deeply integrated with the production increase movement among the masses to form a comprehensive mass movement. This is the only way to more effectively enrich the material strength of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, accumulate national wealth, and create conditions for economic construction. The meeting determined: In order to carry out this movement, it is necessary to start simultaneously in industrial and mining enterprises, trade, finance, grain departments, and government agencies and troops, paying attention to improving labor efficiency, reducing costs, clearing assets, accelerating capital turnover, improving warehouse management, reducing public grain losses, unifying construction projects in capital construction, rationally allocating materials, and strictly supervising construction. Within government agencies, it is necessary to streamline organizations, reduce redundant personnel, and reduce expenditures. At the same time, a movement to combat corruption and waste and rectify financial and economic discipline should be universally launched to eliminate various wasteful and corrupt phenomena and cultivate a new atmosphere and new morality of hard work and simplicity. Regarding land reform, the meeting decided to complete land reform in areas with 50 million agricultural population before April 1952. In areas with a population of 60 million where land reform has been completed, land reform review work should be carried out.

    Regarding democratic reform, the meeting determined that the scope of democratic reform should be limited to production systems (factories, mines), transportation systems (railways, shipping), and various industries closely related to production and urban-rural material exchanges but with serious feudal monopolistic systems (construction, docks, porterage, private boats, fish markets, vegetable markets, manure, etc.).

    In addition, the meeting passed a resolution on carrying out ideological remolding studies for various intellectuals. The meeting criticized Vice Minister of Culture Xu Lingqing for the erroneous thinking exposed in his book "New Logic" (an article criticizing the book was published in the "Cultural Life" column of the Beijing People's Daily on October 28 of this year), and initially reached a consensus in understanding. Xu Lingqing also made a preliminary self-criticism in a speech at the meeting. Deng Zihui, Vice Chairman of the Central South Military and Political Committee, pointed out in his concluding report that the purpose of ideological remolding is to eliminate the ideological remnants of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and to use proletarian ideology to transform various incorrect thoughts. Deng Zihui said: The meeting's criticism of Xu Lingqing's erroneous thinking is a good phenomenon, and Xu Lingqing's preliminary self-criticism is welcome, but a thorough self-criticism requires further efforts to explore. Deng Zihui called on all parts of Central South to be good at organizing discussions with typical examples to deepen the ideological remolding movement.

    The meeting heard reports from Deng Zihui, Vice Chairman of the Central South Military and Political Committee, on the work of the Central South Military and Political Committee in the past six months and its future work tasks; Li Yiqing, Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central South Military and Political Committee, on financial and economic work; Zhao Yimin, Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee, on cultural and educational work; Du Runsheng, Deputy Director of the Land Reform Committee, on land reform; and Li Xuefeng, member of the Central South Military and Political Committee, on democratic reform. The meeting discussed and approved these reports.

    中南军政委员会第四次会议决议
    增产节约继续开展抗美援朝运动
        【新华社汉口二十四日电】中南军政委员会第四次全体会议在十二日到二十二日举行。这次会议遵照毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议上的指示，确定以增加生产、厉行节约、继续开展抗美援朝运动；完成土地改革；贯彻民主改革；开展思想改造运动等项，为中南区今后的中心工作任务。会议经过缜密的讨论和研究，制定了推进这些中心工作的具体方案，并且作出了决议。
    在增产节约方面，会议指出：精简节约、反贪污浪费必须和增产运动同时普遍深入到群众中去，形成一个全面的群众性的运动，才能更有效地充实抗美援朝的物质力量，积累国家财富，创造经济建设的条件。会议确定：为了开展这一运动，须要在工矿企业、贸易、金融、财粮部门和机关、部队等方面同时着手，注意提高劳动效率，减低成本，清理资产，加速资金周转，改善仓库管理，减少公粮耗损，在基本建设上统一建筑事业，合理调配材料，严格监督施工；在机关内部要紧缩机构，精简冗员，减少开支。同时，要普遍展开一个反贪污浪费、整饬财经纪律的运动，来消除各种浪费贪污现象，培养艰苦朴素的新风气和新道德。在土地改革工作方面，会议确定要在一九五二年四月以前在五千万农业人口地区完成土地改革。在已完成土地改革的六千万人口的地区中，要进行土地改革的复查工作。
    在民主改革方面，会议确定民主改革的范围限于生产系统（工厂、矿山）、交通系统（铁路、航运）、与生产事业和城乡物资交流密切相关而又存在着严重的封建把持制度的各种行业（建筑、码头、搬运、民船、鱼栏、菜市、粪便等）。
    此外，会议通过了开展各种知识分子思想改造学习的决议，会议曾经对文化部副部长许凌青在他所著的“新逻辑学”（本年十月二十八日北京人民日报文化生活栏曾刊载批评该书的文章）一书中暴露出来的错误思想进行了批判，并初步达到了认识上的一致。许凌青在大会发言中也作了初步检讨。中南军政委员会副主席邓子恢在会议总结报告中指出：思想改造的目的，是要肃清帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的思想残余，以无产阶级的思想改造各种不正确的思想。邓子恢说：会议对许凌青的错误思想的批判是个好现象，许凌青的初步检讨是值得欢迎的，但是深入的检讨还有待于进一步的努力发掘。邓子恢号召中南各地要善于以典型事例组织讨论，使思想改造运动深入展开。
    这次会议听取了中南军政委员会副主席邓子恢关于中南军政委员会半年来工作和今后工作任务的报告、中南军政委员会财政经济委员会副主任李一清关于财经工作的报告、文化教育委员会主任赵毅敏关于文教工作的报告、土地改革委员会副主任杜润生关于土地改革的报告、中南军政委员会委员李雪峰关于民主改革的报告。会议讨论和通过了这些报告。
