　　Opposing Subjectivism and Formalism in Opera Reform
    He Qifang

    Many of the papers and plays written by Comrade Yang Shaoxuan contain a bad tendency. This time, his "New Celestial River Romance" has been criticized, but instead of examining himself, he arrogantly demanded that the People's Daily, which published the criticism, make a "thorough self-criticism" and write articles to defend his bad tendencies. This is an extremely inappropriate and erroneous attitude. In his letter to the People's Daily, he said: "I believe that Comrade Ai Qing's article reveals an erroneous ideology. It is not simply a matter of one article or a few plays," and "in essence, it violates the opera and literature policy." These words can be used to criticize himself perfectly. From Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's papers and plays, it can be seen that he has a strong sense of subjectivism in his way of thinking, which manifests itself as formalism in his creative methods. This subjectivism and formalism have led him to write some plays with anti-historical tendencies and even to openly praise many old operas that promoted feudal slave morality. All of these directly violate the instructions of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on opera reform work issued on May 5 this year.

    In terms of creative methods, Comrade Yang Shaoxuan first has the following characteristic: instead of studying history and legends with the attitude of seeking truth from facts advocated by Comrade Mao Zedong, and finding their inherent rather than fabricated meanings, he simply and even far-fetchedly interprets them with a few concepts in his mind. Relying on this method of starting from concepts, it is impossible to write works with profound ideological content, and it will inevitably lead to poor artistic quality as well. Therefore, many of Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's plays have another characteristic: they are often written quite dryly, lacking very personal characters and rich and vivid life content, and are merely illustrations of his concepts.

    There is an old opera about Lu Junyi's story called "Daming Prefecture." Comrade Yang Shaoxuan adapted it and called it "New Daming Prefecture." What is "new" about it? The "new" thing is that he rigidly added the concept of "national war" to this story. He said, "The story of Daming Prefecture in 'Water Margin' originally had a relationship with the national war between the Jin and Song dynasties, but the old version did not mention it at all." [1] In fact, there is only one sentence in "Water Margin": "There are more than 3,000 households in this Zengtou City, one of which is called Zeng Family Mansion. This old man is originally from the Kingdom of Jin, named Zeng the Elder." In Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's writing, Zengtou City has become "occupied by Jin soldiers," and Zeng the Elder has become "an official of Zeng who surrendered to the Jin Dynasty." Shi Wengong and Lu Junyi are also called "two generals." Shi Wengong represents the Jin people to discuss "jointly attacking Liangshan" with Daming Prefecture, and advises Lu Junyi to go to Zengtou City, but Lu Junyi is written as a "wise and virtuous gentleman" with nationalistic ideas. However, according to history or legend, the peasant war waged by Liangshanpo did not have the nature of a national war against the Jin people. The Liangshanpo uprising failed in the third year of Xuanhe of the Song Huizong era, while the Jin people invaded in the seventh year of Xuanhe. Another "new" thing about this opera is that the adultery between Lu Junyi's wife and his housekeeper is written as "not a licentious act, but a kind of romanticism," and later this Song Dynasty landlord's wife actually "repents of her romantic enjoyment" and changes her marital relationship with Lu Junyi to be "established on the principle of justice." This change is even less reasonable than the original story. However, after adding these not-so-clever fabrications, Comrade Yang Shaoxuan himself boasted that "New Daming Prefecture" is "a practical example of reforming old operas," while the old version of "Daming Prefecture" is "feudal content" and "should be completely stopped from being performed" [2].

    Comrade Yang Shaoxuan also adapted a "New White Rabbit Story" about Liu Zhiyuan's story, also adding the content of "national war" to the original story. There were facts of the Qidan invasion and the people rising up to resist during Liu Zhiyuan's time. But this opera also has problems. It writes Liu Zhiyuan as if he were a national hero, or, in Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's own words, he "is indeed an important figure in the national war" [3]. In past legends, Liu Zhiyuan was nothing more than a rascal [4]. The "Old History of the Five Dynasties" and "New History of the Five Dynasties" written by feudal landlord-class historians both said that Liu Zhiyuan, like Sang Weihan, fully approved of Shi Jingtang's secret plan to collude with the Qidan. Only "Zizhi Tongjian" recorded that he did not approve of Shi Jingtang ceding the Sixteen Prefectures of Yanyun to the Qidan, but his words were: "It is acceptable to call him a subject, but it is too much to treat him as a father. It is enough to bribe him heavily with gold and silk to get his troops. There is no need to promise him land." This was only a dispute between them on the specific method of colluding with the Qidan. As for colluding with the Qidan and calling themselves subjects, the two had no disagreement. After Shi Jingtang's death, the Qidan invaded and captured Bianjing, the capital of Jin. Liu Zhiyuan also submitted a memorial to congratulate them. Yelu Deguang bestowed a decree of praise, calling him his son, as he did to Shi Jingtang. When the Qidan ravaged the people, Liu Zhiyuan did not fight the Qidan, but preserved his strength in Taiyuan. It was not until the people rose up in revolt and the Qidan retreated that he led his troops into Bianjing. After he arrived in Bianjing, he recognized all the civil and military officials appointed by the Qidan without changing them, and burned all the complaints against them. Even feudal landlord-class historians have always used derogatory terms for such a person. Xue Juzheng, the author of the "Old History of the Five Dynasties," said that he "used to be in charge of the frontier and lost the hope of the people; since he ascended the throne, he has not satisfied the hearts of the people," and "although he has the name of responding to the times, he has not seen the virtue of being a ruler." Ouyang Xiu, the author of the "New History of the Five Dynasties," said that he "was fortunate to take advantage of disaster." Sima Guang, the author of "Zizhi Tongjian," said that he was "unrighteous" and "untrustworthy." How can such a person be said to be "indeed an important figure in the national war"!

    Why did Comrade Yang Shaoxuan, a Communist Party member author, blindly praise such a feudal ruler even feudal landlord-class historians were dissatisfied with? This is because the subjectivism in his mind is at work. He insisted on adding the content of national war to the stories of "Daming Prefecture" and "White Rabbit Story," and insisted on writing Lu Junyi and Liu Zhiyuan as having nationalistic ideas. Therefore, when he read the materials of the History of the Five Dynasties or "Water Margin," he paid special attention to any place that could be exaggerated and far-fetched, and turned a blind eye to or deliberately obliterated anything that was not conducive to his subjective ideas. He did not know that although there have been many national wars in Chinese history, there is absolutely no national war at any time; although some national heroes have appeared in Chinese history, Liu Zhiyuan is definitely not such a person. "National war" is one of the concepts that Comrade Yang Shaoxuan likes to apply everywhere. He and other comrades collectively created a "Driven to Join the Liangshan Rebels." This opera presents the people who create history as the protagonists on the stage, which is correct. Comrade Mao Zedong gave it great encouragement, saying that it opened up "a new face for old operas." But the success of this opera became a burden for Comrade Yang Shaoxuan. Therefore, it must be pointed out that although the opera is good as a whole, and because it has been revised by other comrades, the published "Driven to Join the Liangshan Rebels" now has fewer shortcomings than Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's original manuscript, there are still some relatively far-fetched places in this opera. Writing Gao Qiu as advocating uniting with the Jin people, Lin Chong as advocating resisting the Jin people, and even drilling "peasant tactics" - trench warfare - in the Forbidden Army, is also his application of the concept of "national war." It is also not very appropriate to write the Forbidden Army, the most reliable armed force of the feudal emperor, as being so good, not only having nationalistic ideas, but also sympathizing with the poor people. In "On the Old 'Wild Boar Forest' and 'Driven to Join the Liangshan Rebels' in the Revolution of Old Operas" [5], Comrade Yang Shaoxuan said that the opera "Driven to Join the Liangshan Rebels" "basically writes about the problem of class struggle and national war, and it ultimately writes about the revolutionary theory with workers, peasants, and soldiers as the backbone." He was not satisfied that other comrades "weakened the workers, peasants, and soldiers components of the original manuscript" during the revision. It seems that he does not even know that the soldiers among the workers, peasants, and soldiers mentioned by Comrade Mao Zedong can only be a revolutionary army, not any army of the reactionary ruling class. Many of Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's plays and papers are organized using concepts such as "national war," "class struggle," "historicity," "class nature," and "mass character," and sometimes it becomes a conceptual game [6]. In "On Water Margin and Water Margin Operas," he talked about the "class struggle" written in "Water Margin" in this way: he believes that the general saying that "Water Margin" writes about officials forcing the people to rebel is a "superficial view"; according to his unique view, the class struggle written in "Water Margin" is the "tenant" movement and the "landlord" wavering. His evidence is to copy many places in Water Margin where the words "tenant" appear: "Tenant came out," "Tenant answered," "Call the tenant to arrange the meal," "Tenant brought out a barrel of plate, four kinds of vegetables," "Four or five tenants are sitting there, all enjoying the cool," "Only see the tenant bring out a plate of meat, a plate of cakes, warm a pot of wine," "Chao Gai called the tenant to set fire everywhere,"

    "Song Jiang Song Qing but told the big and small tenants to serve the old master diligently in the morning and evening" [7]... What kind of way of studying problems is this! I am afraid that even the childish formalistic method cannot be mentioned!

    Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's subjectivism has not only developed to a ridiculous degree, but has also become so serious that he enthusiastically praises many old operas that promote feudal slave morality in more than one paper. In "Developing Opera and Literary Criticism," he said, "The most prominent thing in Chinese opera is that it writes about slaves well. Liu Zhong in 'Battle of Puguan,' Zhang En in 'Spring and Autumn Brush,' Cao Fu in 'Walking the Snow Mountain,' Fu Nu in 'Nine Lotus Lanterns,' and Mo Cheng in 'A Pinch of Snow,' etc., all sacrificed themselves to support the struggle for justice. This should not be simply regarded as 'slave morality,' but should be regarded as reflecting the pillars of the slave class in Chinese history, the pillars of the struggle for justice. There is also such a factor in 'A Pinch of Snow,' that is, the slave class represented by Mo Cheng holds a hope, that is, to sacrifice themselves to seek the liberation of the descendants of slaves. Generally speaking, playwrights have also done it in this direction, and it has become a representative work in the history of opera." [8] In "New Culture Movement and Dramatic Revolution," he repeated this meaning. In addition to the above-mentioned people, he also cited Xue Bao of "Double Official Edicts." He said, "No matter what deviations the original playwright's point of view has, it is very obvious that the old opera stage reflects that the slave class is the basic pillar of society." [9] What kind of people are these slaves? They are all "righteous servants" advocated by the feudal ruling class. Liu Zhong of "Battle of Puguan" committed suicide and died, allowing his master to cook his body and give it to the soldiers and civilians in the besieged city to eat in order to "buy people's hearts" [10]. Zhang En of "Spring and Autumn Brush" lost his master's son. The master's wife let him escape. Later, in order to "repay his gratitude," he died for his master [11]. In the Qinqiang script "Killing the Courier Station," Zhang En is called Wu Cheng'en. Before dying in place of his master, he said:

        Thinking back to that year, the white horse escaped its reins to save its master, and the yellow dog crawled through the grass to repay its kindness. Even animals know how to repay their master's kindness, let alone me, Wu Cheng'en, who is a person?
        I think that a person in this world is not afraid of dying early, but afraid of dying without a name. I, Wu Cheng'en, will die today. I am dying for my master, and I am dying righteously. I am dying worthily!

    Cao Fu of "Walking the Snow Mountain" rescued his master's daughter and fled together after the master and mistress were killed by treacherous officials. When passing by Guanghua Mountain, they encountered a heavy snow. Cao Fu took off his clothes and gave them to his master's daughter to wear, and died of freezing. The Beijing opera script wrote that he laughed three times before he froze to death, because the Queen Mother of the West led the Eight Immortals to welcome him to heaven and appointed him as the Land God of the South Heaven Gate [12]. Fu Nu of "Nine Lotus Lanterns" was not afraid of death in order to save his master, and broke into the "underworld" to ask for the Nine Lotus Lanterns that "can solve difficult disasters" [13]. Mo Cheng of "A Pinch of Snow" also died in place of his master. His master, Mo Huaigu, was unwilling to give an jade cup called "A Pinch of Snow" to Yan Shifan and abandoned his official position to escape. Yan Shifan sent people to chase after him. After catching Mo Huaigu, he wanted to execute him on the spot. At this time, Mo Cheng automatically requested to die in his place. The Beijing opera script wrote that he also attempted to "leave a lasting reputation" and compared himself to a dog. After Mo Huaigu accepted his request, he pitifully said:

        This humble servant has a son named Wenlu, who serves the Grand Chancellor in Qiantang. The Grand Chancellor has a bad temper. He scolds when he opens his mouth and punches when he raises his fist.
        My poor child Wenlu lost his mother when he was three years old. I, this humble servant, will die for my master today. Counting the years, he is just seven years old. He can be counted as having lost his father at the age of seven. I hope that the master will treat my child Wenlu differently. Even if I die in the depths of hell, I will be grateful beyond measure.

    This is probably the hope of "seeking the liberation of the descendants of slaves" that Comrade Yang Shaoxuan said (but what kind of "liberation" is this). Mo Cheng also laughed three times before he died, because he believed that "being a slave in this life, dying for my master today, is a happy event" [14]. Xue Bao of "Double Official Edicts" helped his master's second concubine to maintain her chastity and educate her son after the false rumor that the master had died of illness. Later, the master returned home and he and that concubine both received official edicts from the emperor [15]. Comrade Yang Shaoxuan actually said that such people fabricated by the feudal landlord class, who regard themselves as dogs and horses and willingly serve the landlord class until death, are "the pillars of Chinese history" or "the basic pillars of society." Isn't this like talking in his sleep? Comrade Yang Shaoxuan said that people like Mo Huaigu belong to the righteous faction, and people like Yan Shifan belong to the anti-faction. "This opposition between the righteous faction and the anti-faction cannot only be regarded as an internal dispute or sectarian dispute within the feudal aristocratic class, but should be regarded as a reflection of class struggle, because the struggle of the social class must be reflected in the court of the feudal society, thus generating a just and unjust struggle in the court" [16]. This is his theoretical basis for praising those "righteous servants" as historical pillars or social pillars. But Mo Huaigu and Yan Shifan in "A Pinch of Snow" are clearly competing for an jade cup, an antique. What kind of "righteous struggle" is this? Here, Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's magic weapon of far-fetchedness is used again. He said that it can be modified and Mo Cheng's sacrifice can be changed to "support the movement to resist Yan Song's dictatorship." In fact, the struggles within the feudal ruling class are not necessarily all reflections of the class struggle of the entire society. Even if the struggles between some so-called loyal ministers and treacherous ministers have a certain degree of justice, why don't people of his own class die for him, but servants must make sacrifices? This is clearly a very blatant propaganda promoting feudal slave morality, a vicious propaganda that does not hesitate to use posthumous reputation, imperial edicts, and even superstition to deceive and numb the people, which the instructions of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on opera reform work have clearly pointed out must be opposed.

    Even the boundaries between the thoughts of the feudal landlord class and the thoughts of the proletariat are not clear. This is the "class viewpoint" that Comrade Yang Shaoxuan often flaunts.

    In many articles, Comrade Yang Shaoxuan flaunts proletarian ideology and historical materialism. In "A Brief History of the Development of Chinese Opera and the Direction of the Old Opera Revolution," he said, "Without Marxist historical materialism and dialectical materialism, you can't even talk lightly about old opera." [17] The last slogan of his recently written article answering Comrade Ai Qing's criticism, "On the Harm of 'Literature for Literature, Art for Art'," is: "Strive for the victory of proletarian literature and art." But, unfortunately, the proletarian thought he understands, the historical materialism he understands, is nothing more than a few abstract concepts. He thinks that relying on these few simple concepts can solve all problems, can talk about history, can talk about literature and art, can write papers, and can write plays. His practice is really like thinking that "applying theory to any historical era" is "easier than solving a simple equation" [18]. He does not know that Engels once said, "Even the development of a materialist point of view in a separate historical instance requires years of quiet study of scientific work, because it is obvious that it is not enough to rely on words, only a large amount of critically selected and very familiar historical materials can complete this task." [19] As for writing a truly good historical drama, it must not only conform to historical science in its fundamentals, but also make it a moving work of art. In this way, there must be typical characters with very distinct personalities, life content that can attract people, and beautiful structure and language. Otherwise, even if the basic political content of this opera is correct, it is still the kind of "Schillerism that regards individuals as simple trumpets of the spirit of the times" criticized by Marx, which violates his emphasis on "must be Shakespearean." Chinese Beijing opera is very stereotyped in many ways, and even the dialogue has a batch of commonly used clichés. Without the necessary ideological and artistic cultivation, we can easily take the road of formalism when adapting or creating Beijing opera scripts. Comrades who are engaged in opera reform work must not only be good at preserving and developing the original advantages of Chinese opera, but also have the courage to introduce some new things into them. But this new thing should really be good ideological content and artistic components, not Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's subjectivism and formalism.

    Judging from Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's "On the Harm of 'Literature for Literature, Art for Art'" and his three letters to the People's Daily, he still does not recognize the error of his tendency at all. He said that Comrade Mao Zedong once said that we want to move away the mountains of feudalism and imperialism. This is also "using mythology to allude to reality." This can only prove that he cannot even distinguish between "metaphor" and "innuendo." He also cut off a passage from "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte" to defend his misuse of new-style language in "New Celestial River Romance." This is even more irrelevant. That passage of Marx is also a metaphorical statement. He is talking about the problem of historical political struggles using old traditions, which has nothing to do with the language of literary works. He also cited Lu Xun's "Old Tales Retold." The "Old Tales Retold" did use the technique of "innuendo." This only shows that under certain circumstances, such as under the oppression of the reactionary ruling class, the technique of "innuendo" is not absolutely unusable. But Comrade Yang Shaoxuan should further study Lu Xun's own explanation of "Old Tales Retold." Lu Xun said that in "Old Tales Retold," "most of the works are playful," "except for 'Casting the Sword,' they are all inevitably slick," and "slickness is the great enemy of creation." He also said, "For historical novels, it is believed that those who extensively examine the literature and speak with evidence, even if some people ridicule them as 'professor novels,' are actually difficult to organize, as for those who only take a little cause and casually embellish them into an article, they do not need any skills." [20] Comrade Yang Shaoxuan often makes this mistake: only taking a little cause, or even without any cause, and casually embellishing it. Lu Xun once criticized an article in the Shanghai newspapers at that time, "Teaching people that when eating watermelon, they should also think that our land is being cut into pieces, like this watermelon." [21] It is as incongruous to insist on adding some pigeons and owls to the story of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl, thinking that this is "reflecting the anti-American aggression and aiding Korea and defending world peace," as it is to teach people that they must think of the land that was cut into pieces at that time when eating watermelon. We need serious works. To seriously write works with considerable ideological and artistic qualities, whether reflecting the current reality or using ancient history or mythology as the subject matter, is not easy, and it is much more difficult than casually adding some pigeons and owls. Comrade Yang Shaoxuan said that to reform old stories and old scripts, they will inevitably become "another thing." He used this to defend his "New Celestial River Romance," which casually added some pigeons and owls. But the problem is not to argue abstractly whether adapting old operas can become "another thing," but to focus on whether the advantages of the original legend or script are properly preserved, and whether the "another thing" that is changed is really good. Comrade Yang Shaoxuan also said that for the literary and artistic works of workers and peasants, even if they are very naive and simple, we should adopt an attitude of love and respect, because

    "Without naivety, there is no so-called growth, and without simplicity, it is difficult to imagine perfection." This is of course correct. However, this cannot be used to cover up the shortcomings of his own works, especially the tendency shortcomings. Continuing to take the road of subjective formalism will never grow up or be perfect.

    It should be stated that subjective formalism is a fairly common tendency in opera reform, and it is not only in Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's works. Comrade Yang Shaoxuan himself has criticized this tendency: "There is a situation in dealing with old scripts now, that is, some people, when they look at an old script, are aroused by a certain feeling at a certain point, so their ideological waves flood up, and they make a big change and a special change, pulling things from the east and the west, and as a result, it becomes another thing, and after the performance, the audience feels that the new is not as good as the old... There is this situation on the stage now, that is, several scripts with different plots in the past are coincidentally changed into an old set with one face, which makes the audience tired." [22] These words are also suitable for criticizing himself. But the problem lies here, these words can only be used to criticize others, not to criticize him. Whoever criticizes him is "expressing dissatisfaction with the development of the anti-American aggression and aiding Korea movement," is "helping the American imperialism Truman," and even the Party newspaper that publishes this criticism should make a "thorough self-criticism." Stalin said, "The strength of Bolshevism also lies in that they are not afraid to admit their mistakes." He also said, "I think we need self-criticism as much as we need air and water." Comrade Mao Zedong also earnestly warned us: "We should restrain complacency, and constantly criticize our shortcomings, just as we need to wash our faces and sweep the floor every day in order to clean and remove dust." Last April, our Party Central Committee also made a decision on launching criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals. However, Comrade Yang Shaoxuan, who likes to flaunt proletarian thought, is very lacking in the proletarian style in this regard. Therefore, in addition to opposing his tendency of subjective formalism, we must also oppose his attitude of persisting in mistakes and refusing criticism!

　　反对戏曲改革中的主观主义公式主义
    何其芳
    杨绍萱同志所写的有关戏曲改革的论文和剧本，其中有许多都包含着一种不好的倾向。这次，他的“新天河配”受到批评，他不检讨自己，反而狂妄地要求发表这种批评的人民日报“彻底检讨”，并写文章来为自己的不好倾向辩护。这是极不应有的错误态度。他在致人民日报的信上说：“我认为艾青这篇文章是一种错误思想的透露，不是单纯一篇文章问题，也不是为了什么个把剧本的问题。”“在本质上则是违反了戏曲文艺政策。”这些话刚好可以用来批评他自己。从杨绍萱同志的论文和剧本可以看出，他在思想方法上存在着浓厚的主观主义，表现在创作方法上则成为公式主义。这种主观主义公式主义使他写出某些带有反历史主义色彩的剧本，并且严重到公然赞扬许多鼓吹封建奴隶道德的旧戏。这都是和今年五月五日中央人民政府政务院关于戏曲改革工作的指示直接相违反的。
    在创作方法上，杨绍萱同志首先有这样一个特点：他不是用毛泽东同志所提倡的实事求是的态度去研究历史和传说，从它们里面找出其固有的而不是臆造的意义来，而是用他脑子里面的几个为数甚少的概念来简单地以至牵强附会地解释它们。依靠这种从概念出发的方法绝不可能写出有深刻的思想性的作品，而且必然会招致艺术性也贫弱的结果。所以杨绍萱同志的许多剧本又有另外一个特点，它们常常是写得相当枯燥的，缺少很有个性的人物，缺少丰富的生动的生活内容，而只是他的一些概念的说明。
    旧戏里面有一个写卢俊义故事的“大名府”。杨绍萱同志把它改编了，号称“新大名府”。到底有什么“新”的地方呢？“新”的地方就在于他生硬地把“民族战争”这一概念加在这个故事上。他说，“水浒传中所写大名府的故事，本来有着金宋两个民族战争的关系，而旧本却一字不曾提到。”〔一〕其实“水浒传”上不过有这样一句话，“这个曾头市上共有三千余家，内有一家唤做曾家府，这老子原是大金国人，名为曾长者。”到了杨绍萱同志的笔下，曾头市却成为已“被金兵占据”，曾长者成为“降顺金邦”的“曾长官”，史文恭和卢俊义也被称为“二位将军”，史文恭代表金人来和大名府商量“联合夹击梁山”，并劝卢俊义到曾头市去，而卢俊义却被写为一个富有民族思想的“贤明士绅”。然而无论根据历史，还是根据传说，梁山泊所进行的农民战争并没有反抗金人的民族战争的性质。在宋徽宗宣和三年，梁山泊的起义就失败了，而金人入寇却在宣和七年。这个戏还有一点“新”的地方，就是把卢俊义的妻子和他的总管家的通奸写为“不是一个淫荡行为，而只是一种浪漫主义”，并且后来这个宋代的地主婆姨居然“悔悟到自己浪漫享乐的错误”，改变得和卢俊义的夫妻关系“建立在正义原则之上”。这也改得反而不如原来的故事合理。但是，加上了这样一些并不高明的臆造，杨绍萱同志就自己鼓吹“新大名府”是“改革旧剧的一个实际范例”，而旧本“大名府”却是“封建主义的内容”，“应完全停演”〔二〕。
    杨绍萱同志还改编有一本写刘知远故事的“新白兔记”，也是给原来的故事加上了“民族战争”的内容。刘知远的时代是有契丹入侵，人民起而反抗的事实的。但这个戏也有问题。它把刘知远写得好像是一个民族英雄，或者用杨绍萱同志自己的话说，他“确系民族战争中的重要人物”〔三〕。在过去的传说里面，刘知远不过是一个无赖〔四〕。封建地主阶级的历史家所写的“旧五代史”和“新五代史”，都说石敬塘勾结契丹的密计，刘知远是和桑维翰一样，完全赞成的。“资治通鉴”上才记载了他不赞成石敬塘割燕云十六州给契丹，但他的话是这样：“称臣可矣，以父事之太过。厚以金帛赂之，自足致其兵，不必许以土田。”这也只是在勾结契丹的具体方法上他们有些争论，至于勾结契丹并向之称臣，两人却并无什么分歧。石敬塘死后，契丹入寇，打下了晋的都城开封，刘知远还上表称贺。耶律德光赐诏褒美，和对石敬塘一样称他为儿。契丹蹂躏人民时，刘知远并没有打契丹，却在太原保存实力。等到人民群起反抗，契丹退走以后，他才带兵进入开封。他到开封后，对契丹委任的文官武官一律承认，不加变更，并把告他们的状子都烧了。对这样一个人物，连封建地主阶级的历史家向来都是有贬词的。“旧五代史”的作者薛居正说他“昔莅戎藩，素亏物望；洎登宸极，未厌人心”，“虽有应运之名，而未睹为君之德”。“新五代史”的作者欧阳修说他“幸祸以为利”。“资治通鉴”的作者司马光说他“不仁”、“不信”。这样的人怎么能够说“确系民族战争中的重要人物”！
    为什么共产党员作者的杨绍萱同志，竟会对这样一个连封建地主阶级的历史家也不满意的封建统治者盲目歌颂呢？这就是他头脑里面的主观主义在作怪。他硬要把“大名府”和“白兔记”的故事加上民族战争的内容，硬要把卢俊义和刘知远写成富有民族思想，于是他看五代史材料或“水浒传”的时候，凡是可以供他夸大附会的地方他就特别注意，而不利于他的主观想法的地方他就视而不见，或者有意抹杀。他不知道虽然中国历史上有过多次的民族战争，但绝不是任何时候都有民族战争；虽然中国历史上出现过一些民族英雄，但刘知远绝不是这样的人。“民族战争”，这就是杨绍萱同志最喜欢到处应用的概念之一。他和其他同志集体创作过一个“逼上梁山”。这个戏把创造历史的人民表现为舞台上的主角，这是正确的。毛泽东同志曾因此给以很大的鼓励，说它使“旧剧开了新生面”。但这个戏的演出的成功却成了杨绍萱同志的包袱。因此，必须指出，虽然整个地说来，这个戏是好的，而且由于经过了其他同志的修改，现在出版的“逼上梁山”已比杨绍萱同志的原稿缺点少，但在这个戏里面也还是可以找到比较勉强的地方。把高俅写成主张联合金人，林冲写成主张反抗金人，以至在禁军里面也要操演“农民战术”——穿沟战法，这也是他的“民族战争”概念的应用。把禁军这种封建皇帝最可靠的武装写得那样好，不但富有民族思想，而且很同情穷苦人民，也不大恰当。杨绍萱同志在“论旧剧革命中的旧‘野猪林’与‘逼上梁山’”〔五〕中说，“逼上梁山”这个戏“基本上是写阶级斗争和民族战争的问题，它终是写了工农兵为骨干的革命理论”。他不满意别的同志修改时“把原稿工农兵的成份削弱了”。他好像竟不知道毛泽东同志所说的工农兵，其中的兵只能是革命的军队，而不是任何反动统治阶级的军队。杨绍萱同志的许多剧本和论文就是用“民族战争”、“阶级斗争”、“历史性”、“阶级性”、“群众性”等这样一些概念组织起来的，有些时候简直成了概念游戏〔六〕。在“论水浒传与水浒戏”中，他对于“水浒传”所写的“阶级斗争”是这样讲的：他认为一般人说“水浒传”是写官逼民反，那是“浅白之见”；据他的独特之见，“水浒传所写的阶级斗争是‘庄客’运动和‘庄主’动摇”。他的证据就是把水浒传上有“庄客”二字的地方抄上许多：“庄客出来”，“庄客答道”，“叫庄客安排饭来”，“庄客托出一桶盘，四样菜蔬”，“坐着四五个庄客，都在那里乘凉”，“只见庄客托出一盘肉，一盘饼，温一壶酒”，“晁盖叫庄客四下里只顾放火”，
    “宋江宋清却分咐大小庄客，早晚殷勤服侍太公”〔七〕……这叫什么样的研究问题的方法呵！恐怕连幼稚的形式主义的方法都说不上吧！
    杨绍萱同志的主观主义不仅发展到可笑的程度，而且严重到不止在一篇论文里热烈地赞扬许多鼓吹封建奴隶道德的旧戏。他在“开展戏曲文艺评论”中说，“中国戏曲里最突出的是写奴隶写得好，战蒲关的刘忠、春秋笔的张恩、走雪山的曹福、九莲灯的富奴、以至一捧雪的莫成等等，都是在支持正义斗争上，牺牲了自己，这不宜简单看做‘奴隶道德’，而应看做是反映了奴隶阶级在中国历史上的支柱，正义斗争的支柱。一捧雪里也存在了这样一个因素，就是以莫成为代表的奴隶阶级抱着一个希望，就是牺牲自己以求解放奴隶的后代儿孙，大体上剧作家也都向这个方向做的，以至成为戏曲史上的代表作。”〔八〕在“新文化运动与戏剧革命”中，他把这样的意思又讲了一遍。除了以上那些人，他还举出了“双官诰”的薛宝。他说，“无论原剧作者观点上有何偏差，而旧剧舞台上反映着奴隶阶级是社会的基本支柱，那是很明显的。”〔九〕这些奴隶到底是些什么样的人物呢？都是封建统治阶级所提倡的“义仆”。“战蒲关”的刘忠，是自刎而死，让主人把他的尸首烹来给围城中的军民吃，以便“买服人心”〔十〕。“春秋笔”的张恩，是失落了主人的儿子，主母放他逃走，后来他为了“报恩”，代主人受死刑〔一一〕。在秦腔剧本“杀驿”里面，张恩叫吴承恩。他在代替主人死以前这样说：
        想当年白马脱缰救主，黄犬钻草报恩，畜牲
    尚知报主之恩，何况我吴承恩是个人乎？
        我想为人在世，不怕早死，但怕死后无名，
    我吴承恩今日一死，我是替主死的，我也死的
    该，我也死的值，我死的该！“走雪山”的曹福，在主人主母都被奸臣害死后，救出主人的女儿一起逃难。路过广华山时遇到一场大雪，曹福把衣服脱给主人的女儿穿，因而冻死。京戏脚本写他冻死前还大笑三声，因为王母娘娘带领八仙来迎接他升天，并封他为南天门都土地〔一二〕。“九莲灯”的富奴，为了救主人，死也不怕，闯入“阴界”去求那“能解难度厄”的九莲灯〔一三〕。“一捧雪”的莫成也是代替主人受死刑。他的主人莫怀古不愿把一只叫做一捧雪的玉杯送给严世藩，弃官逃走。严世蕃派人追赶，捉住莫怀古以后要就地正法。这时莫成自动要求替死。京戏脚本写他也是企图“落个万古流芳”，并自比为犬。等到莫怀古接受了他的这种要求后，他又可怜地说：
        小人有一子，名唤文禄，在钱塘服侍大相
    公。大相公性情不好，开口就骂，举拳就打。
    可怜我那文禄孩儿，他三岁亡母。小人今日替
    老爷一死，算算刚刚七岁，可算七岁亡父。望
    求老爷另眼看待我那文禄孩儿。小人纵死九
    泉，也是感恩非浅。这大概就是杨绍萱同志所说的“求解放奴隶的后代儿孙”的希望（但是，这算什么“解放”呵）。莫成死以前也是大笑三声，因为他认为“一世为奴，今日替我老爷一死，乃是一桩喜事”〔一四〕。“双官诰”的薛宝，是在讹传主人病死以后，帮助主人的第二个小老婆守节教子，后来主人回家他和那个小老婆都受到皇帝的封诰〔一五〕。像这样一些封建地主阶级捏造出来的以犬马自居，甘心替地主阶级服务到死的人，杨绍萱同志居然说他们是“中国历史上的支柱”或“社会的基本支柱”，岂不是像在说梦话吗？杨绍萱同志说，莫怀古这样一些人属于正派，严世蕃那样一些人属于反派，“这种正派和反派的对立，不能只看做是封建贵族阶级的内部纠纷或宗派纠纷，而应看做是也是阶级斗争的反映，因为社会阶级的斗争一定要反映到封建社会的朝廷内部去，从而在朝廷上发生了正义的和反正义的斗争”〔一六〕。这是他歌颂那些“义仆”为历史支柱或社会支柱的理论根据。但是，“一捧雪”里所写的莫怀古和严世蕃明明是争夺一个玉杯，一个古玩，又算得什么“正义斗争”呢？在这里，杨绍萱同志的牵强附会的法宝又拿出来了。他说，可以修改一下，可以把莫成的牺牲改为“是为了支持反抗严嵩专政的运动”。其实封建统治阶级内部的斗争并不一定都是整个社会的阶级斗争的反映。即使某些所谓忠臣和奸臣的斗争带有一定的正义性，为什么他本阶级的人不去替他死，而一定要仆人来作牺牲呢？这明明是非常露骨的提倡封建奴隶道德的宣传，不惜用死后的名誉、皇帝的封诰以至迷信来欺骗麻醉人民的恶毒宣传，正是中央人民政府政务院关于戏曲改革工作的指示中曾经明确地指了出来，必须加以反对的。
    连封建地主阶级的思想和无产阶级的思想的界限都分不清楚，这就是杨绍萱同志常常标榜着的“阶级观点”。
    在许多文章里面，杨绍萱同志都标榜着无产阶级的思想，标榜着历史唯物论。他在“中国戏曲发展史略与旧剧革命的方向”中说，“没有马克思主义的历史唯物论和辩证唯物论，连旧剧都不好让你轻谈。”〔一七〕他最近写的回答艾青同志的批评的文章，“论‘为文学而文学、为艺术而艺术’的危害性”，最后的口号是：“为无产阶级文艺胜利而努力”。但是，不幸得很，他所了解的无产阶级思想，他所了解的历史唯物论，不过是很少几个抽象的概念。他以为依靠这样几个简单的概念就可以解决一切问题，既可以谈历史，又可以谈文艺，既可以写论文，又可以写剧本。他这种作法，真是好像以为“把理论应用到任何一个历史时代”，“比解决简单的一次方程式还更容易”〔一八〕。他不知道恩格斯曾经说过，“即令是唯物论的观点在一个单独的历史实例的发展，也是需要数年静心研究的科学工作，因为这很明显，仅仅依靠词句是不行的，只有大量经过批判的选择并十分熟悉的历史材料才能完成这一任务。”〔一九〕至于要写出一个真正好的历史剧，更不仅要在根本之处符合历史科学，而且还要使它成为一个动人的艺术品。这样，就必须有个性很鲜明的典型人物，能够吸引人的生活内容，优美的结构和语言。不然，即使这个戏的基本政治内容是正确的，也仍然是马克思所批评过的那种“把个人作为时代精神的单纯号筒的席勒主义”，违反了他所强调的“必须莎士比亚化”。中国的京剧，在许多方面都很定型化，连说白都有一批惯用的套语。如果没有必要的思想修养和艺术修养，我们改编或创作京剧脚本的时候很容易走公式主义的道路。做戏曲改革工作的同志既要善于保存和发扬中国戏曲原有的优点，又必须有勇气引进一些新的东西到它们里面去。但这种新的东西应该真正是好的思想内容和艺术成分，而不是杨绍萱同志那样的主观主义公式主义。
    从杨绍萱同志的“论‘为文学而文学、为艺术而艺术’的危害性”和他给人民日报的三封信看来，他还完全不认识他的倾向的错误。他说，毛泽东同志曾经讲过，我们要移掉封建主义之山，帝国主义之山，这也是“借神话影射现实”。这只能证明他连“比喻”和“影射”都分不清楚。他又割裂“拿破仑第三政变记”里面的一段话来为他在“新天河配”中乱用新式语言辩护。这更是牛头不对马嘴。马克思那段话也是一种比喻的说法。他讲的是历史上的政治斗争利用旧传统的问题，根本和文艺作品的语言问题没有关系。他又还举出了鲁迅的“故事新编”。“故事新编”里面是用过“影射”的手法的。这也不过说明了在一定的情况之下，比如说在反动统治阶级的压迫之下，“影射”的手法并非绝对不能用。但杨绍萱同志却应该更进一步来研究一下鲁迅自己对于“故事新编”的说明。鲁迅说，“故事新编”里面，“游戏之作居多”，“除‘铸剑’外，都不免油滑”，而“油滑是创作的大敌”。他又说，“对于历史小说，则以为博考文献，言必有据者，纵使有人讥为‘教授小说’，其实是很难组织之作，至于只取一点因由，随意点染，铺成一篇，倒无需怎样的手腕。”〔二○〕杨绍萱同志就正是常常犯了这种毛病：只取一点因由，或者甚至毫无因由，随意点染。鲁迅对于当时上海报纸上的一篇文章“教人当吃西瓜时，也该想我们土地的被割碎，像这西瓜一样”，曾给以批评〔二一〕。硬要在牛郎织女的故事中加上一些鸽子和?枭之类，以为这样就算“反映抗美援朝，保卫世界和平”，正是和教人吃西瓜也必须想到当时被割碎的土地一样不伦不类。我们需要严肃的作品。要认真地写出思想性和艺术性都相当高的作品来，无论是反映当前的现实，或者是以古代的历史或神话为题材，都是并不容易的，都要比随意加上一些鸽子和?枭之类困难得多。杨绍萱同志说，要对旧故事旧剧本加以改革，就必然会成为“另外一个东西”。他用这来为他的随意加上一些鸽子和?枭之类的“新天河配”辩护。但问题不在于抽象地争论改编旧剧可不可以成为“另外一个东西”，而在于第一，是否适当地保存了原来的传说或剧本的优点；第二，改成的“另外一个东西”是否真正好。杨绍萱同志又说，对于工人农民的文艺作品，尽管它很幼稚很简陋，我们也应该采取爱护和尊重的态度，因为
    “没有幼稚就无所谓壮大，没有简陋也难以想像完美”。这当然是对的。但是，这并不能用来掩饰他自己的作品的缺点，尤其是带倾向性的缺点。继续走主观主义公式主义的道路，那是永远也壮大不起来，完美不起来的。
    应当说明，主观主义公式主义是戏曲改革中相当普遍存在的倾向，并不只是杨绍萱同志的作品中才有。杨绍萱同志自己就曾经批评过这种倾向：“现在处理旧剧本有这样一种情况，就是有的人一看某一个旧剧本，在某一点上引起他某一种感想，于是他的思想浪潮就泛滥起来，就此大改特改，东扯西拉，结果乃变成了另一个东西，演出后却使观众发生新不如旧之感……现时舞台上就有这种情况，把已往若干情节不同的剧本，乃不谋而合地改成了一个面貌的老一套，而使观众生厌了。”〔二二〕这些话用来批评他自己，也是适合的。但问题却在这里，这些话只能用来批评别人，不能用来批评他。谁要是批评了他，就是“对于抗美援朝运动的发展表示了不满”，就是“帮助的是美帝国主义杜鲁门”，而且连发表这种批评的党报也要“彻底检讨”。斯大林说，“布尔什维主义的力量也正在于：他们不怕承认自己的错误。”他又说，“我认为我们需要自我批评，就像需要空气和水一样。”毛泽东同志也谆谆告诫我们：“我们应该抑制自满，时时批评自己的缺点，好像我们为了清洁，为了去掉灰尘，天天要洗脸，天天要扫地一样。”去年四月，我们党中央又还作了关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定。然而，喜欢标榜无产阶级思想的杨绍萱同志，却在这一点上非常缺乏无产阶级的作风。因此，除了反对他的主观主义公式主义的倾向而外，还必须反对他的这种坚持错误，拒绝批评的态度！十一月六日晨〔一〕“‘新大名府’里所反映的阶级斗争和统一战线”
