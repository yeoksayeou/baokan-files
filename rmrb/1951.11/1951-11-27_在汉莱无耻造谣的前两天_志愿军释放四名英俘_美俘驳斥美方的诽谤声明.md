Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, November 26th: Our frontline reporter reports: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army recently released four British prisoners of war on the right bank of the Imjin River front. One of them was James Lawlinson (number 2975651), Sergeant Deputy Platoon Leader of the 11th Platoon, 4th Company, Scottish Borderers Regiment, 28th Brigade of the British Army. He was captured on November 4th during the battle of Maryang-san. Two days before Hanley, Chief of the Military Law Department of the Eighth Army of the American invading forces, issued the shameless lie of slandering the Korean-Chinese People's Army for killing prisoners of war, he was released back to his original unit with more than thirty letters written by the twenty-five British soldiers who were captured with him. Before leaving, he expressed his gratitude for the Volunteers' kind treatment.

In the letters that James Lawlinson took back, the prisoners of war reported the truth about their pleasant life after being captured to their relatives and friends.

Xinhua News Agency, November 26th: TASS, Pyongyang, November 26th: On November 25th, "Rodong Sinmun" published a telegram from an American prisoner of war camp in North Korea. Sergeant Dobbs of the 11th Company, 3rd Battalion, 9th Regiment, 2nd Division of the US Army, told the newspaper's reporter: When we were captured, my comrades and I expected to be killed, because our commanders often told us that the People's Army kills prisoners. However, now we are not only still alive, but also receiving very good treatment. We get good food on time. We can read newspapers and magazines at will. I am becoming more and more clear that I participated in the Wall Street imperialists' evil war against the Korean people.

Sergeant Anker of the 5th Company, 2nd Battalion, 38th Regiment, 2nd Division of the US Army, also said the same thing. Marine Markes of the 1st Division of the US Marine Corps and Corporal Hannano of the 5th Company, 2nd Battalion, 38th Regiment, 2nd Division of the US Army refuted the slanderous statement by the United Nations Command that captured soldiers of the "United Nations Armed Forces" were killed. The prisoners of war expressed their indignation at these claims and emphasized that the People's Army treats prisoners of war very humanely.

    在汉莱无耻造谣的前两天
    志愿军释放四名英俘
    美俘驳斥美方的诽谤声明
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十六日电】本社前线记者报道：中国人民志愿军最近在临津江右岸前线释放了四名英军俘虏。其中一名是英军第二十八旅苏格兰边防团第四连第十一排上士副排长詹姆士·劳利逊（编号二九七五六五一）。他是十一月四日在马良山作战中被俘的。在美国侵略军第八军军法处处长汉莱发出诬蔑朝中人民军队杀害战俘的无耻谎言的两天前，他带着和他同时被俘的二十五名英军士兵写的三十多封信件，被释放回原部队去。临行前，他十分感谢志愿军的宽待。
    在詹姆士·劳利逊带回去的信件中，俘虏们向他们的亲友们报告了他们被俘后愉快生活的实情。
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社平壤二十六日讯：十一月二十五日，“劳动新闻”发表了来自北朝鲜美国战俘营的电讯。美军第二师第九团第三营第十一连的中士道勃对该报记者说：当我们被俘的时候，我和我的同伴本来预料会遭到杀害，因为我们的指挥官们常常告诉我们，人民军杀害俘虏。然而，现在我们不仅还活着，而且还得到很好的待遇。我们按时得到很好的饮食。我们可以随意阅读报纸和杂志。我越来越清楚地明白了，我参加了华尔街帝国主义者对朝鲜人民进行的罪恶战争。
    美军第二师第三十八团第二营第五连中士安刻尔也说了这样的话。美国海军陆战队第一师士兵马刻斯与美军第二师第三十八团第二营第五连下士汉那诺驳斥了联合国军司令部所谓“联合国武装部队”被俘士兵遭到杀害的诽谤声明。战俘们对这些说法表示愤慨，他们并强调指出，人民军对待战俘非常人道。
