After exposing the crimes of the American imperialists and their running dogs in deliberately persecuting the broad masses of the Japanese people, despising humanitarianism, and their ambitions and conspiracies to undermine peace, the statement said: "We believe that, under the heroic and unyielding struggle of the Japanese people, and under the support and heavy blows of the people of the world, the imperialists will surely fail before us. Based on a humanitarian standpoint and the desire to maintain world peace, this society hereby issues a statement in support of the struggle of the twenty innocent Japanese patriotic workers arrested in the 'Matsukawa Incident'."
