    Strong People
    ——A Record of Visiting Volunteer Army Wounded and Sick
    Han Feng, Gao Kedong, Zhang Sikai
    We visited the recuperating members of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in a certain hospital.

    Every time we went to the wards, we saw the recuperating comrades writing, reading, and looking at picture books on small square tables beside their beds. Some comrades couldn't sit up and read while lying on their sides. Some could only lie on their backs, so they hung a "bookshelf" made of wire from the top of the bed and inserted books into it to read while lying down.

    We visited Ward 27 of the Second Team of a certain hospital. Li Heqing, the ward leader, told us that all the recuperating members in their ward were divided into three groups according to their educational level and participated in learning. Each group selected a "little teacher." They had classes three times a week and reviewed on their own at other times.

    "Recuperate early and return to the front." This is the common wish of the recuperating members. Usually, they talked most about their experiences in fighting the American aggressors and the heroic deeds of their comrades. Some comrades stroked their wounds anxiously and said, "Get well soon! I'm waiting to return to the front!"

    When they talked about "returning to the front," they always avoided the disabled comrades.

    However, the disabled comrades also had their own plans.

    Communist Party member Sun Jinmin was blinded in both eyes due to injuries; the toes of both feet and the fingers of his right hand were disabled due to frostbite. But this strong man was still full of optimism. After arriving at the hospital, he practiced writing with his left hand by touch. We saw his study notebook. The lines of characters were written neatly. He asked comrades in the ward to read newspapers and books to him every day. He was wholeheartedly yearning for the Paul Korchagin in the Soviet masterpiece "How the Steel Was Tempered."

    When we went to visit him with great respect, he smiled and said to us, "Comrades, I don't think my eyes are blind, and my body is not disabled. I can still study now. After I recover from my injuries, I can still work for the people and the Party."

    The Volunteer Army wounded and sick lived very happily. They often spontaneously organized evening parties. One afternoon, we went to a sanatorium team. As soon as we entered the door, we happened to see Comrade Zhang Heliang sitting by the bed singing a 快板 [clapper talk]. All the comrades in the ward were smiling, nodding, and clapping their hands rhythmically. Chen Xueshan, with his arm in a sling decorated with flowers, and a young nurse were dancing to the beat. The ward was immersed in a joyful atmosphere.

    Where does their firm will and high degree of optimism come from? A wounded comrade's words answered this question. He said, "Having shed blood for the motherland makes one more aware of the loveliness of the motherland. But is it enough to just say you love it? To love the motherland, you must take out everything you can contribute." Gu Ge, whose left eye was injured by a bomb and whose hands were also disabled, said, "My eyes are injured, and my hands are disabled, but we have protected the eyes and hands of thousands upon thousands of people in our motherland. I think this is the greatest glory of my life."

    The wounded and sick comrades' love for the motherland is even more concentrated in their love and care for their leader, Chairman Mao. As soon as the Volunteer Army wounded arrived at a certain hospital, they first wrote a letter to Chairman Mao. The letter reported the victories at the front and the welcome and condolences they received from the people of the motherland. They also expressed their determination to rest assured and recuperate, and strive to return to the front and their jobs as soon as possible. Finally, they asked Chairman Mao to send them a recent photo so that everyone could take a closer look at their beloved leader.

    Soon, Chairman Mao's reply arrived, along with a recent photo. This caused a sensation throughout the hospital. Everyone was extremely excited and passed the letter and photo around the beds in turn. Everyone looked at them again and again, discussing them with concern. Some people said happily, "Chairman Mao has gained weight!" But others said, "He hasn't gained weight, I'm afraid he's too busy with work—Chairman Mao, don't be too tired!" But others also said, "Our country is so big, how many things must happen every day, Chairman Mao is unwilling to rest!"…

    In short, the Volunteer Army heroes, while recuperating from their injuries, are also concerned about the country and their leader.

    坚强的人们
    ——志愿军伤病员慰问记
    韩枫、高克冬、张思恺
    我们曾在某地医院里慰问过中国人民志愿军的休养员。
    每次到病房去，我们都看到休养员同志们在床畔的小方桌上写字、读书、看画报。有的同志还不能坐起，就侧卧着阅读。有的只能仰卧，就从床顶上吊下一个用铁丝做的“书架”，把书插在里面躺着看。
    我们访问某院二队二十七号病房。病房班长李和清同志告诉我们，他们全病房的休养员按文化程度分编三个小组，都参加了学习。每组选出了“小先生”。每星期上课三次，平常自己温习。
    “早点休养好，回前方去。”这是休养员们共同的愿望。平时，他们谈论得最多的就是同美国侵略军作战的经验，战友们的英雄事迹等。有的同志这时抚摸着伤口焦急地说：“快点好吧！我等着回前方哪！”
    他们谈起“回前方”，总是避开残废了的同志。
    可是，残废了的同志也都有自己的打算。
    共产党员孙晋民，两眼负伤失明；两脚的脚趾和右手的手指都因冻伤而残废了。但这个坚强的人，还是充满了乐观情绪。到医院后，他用左手摸索着练习写字。我们曾看到他的学习本子。一行一行的字，写得很齐整。他每天请病房的同志读报、读书给他听。他一心向往着苏联名著“钢铁是怎样炼成的”里面的保尔·柯察金。
    我们怀着万分敬意去慰问他时，他满面笑容，对我们说：“同志，我以为我的眼睛没有瞎，身体也没有残废。我现在一样能学习。伤养好以后，也一样能为人民、为党工作。”
    志愿军伤病员们生活得非常愉快。他们经常自动地组织晚会。一天下午，我们到一个疗养队去。一进门，正碰上伤员张和良同志坐在床边唱着快板。全病房的同志们一个个在笑着，点着头，有节奏地拍着手。手臂带花吊在胸前的陈雪山和一个小看护员，随着拍子在跳舞。病房沉浸在愉悦的气氛里。
    他们这种坚定的意志和高度的乐观主义精神从那儿来的呢？一位伤员同志的话解答了这个问题。他说：“为祖国流过血，就更加知道祖国的可爱。可是光说爱行吗？爱祖国，就要把自己能够贡献的一切都拿出来。”左眼被炸伤，双手也残废了的顾革同志这样说：“我的眼睛受了伤，我的手残废了，可是我们保卫了祖国人民千千万万双眼睛，千千万万双手。我觉得这是我一生中最大的光荣。”
    伤病员同志对祖国人民的热爱，更集中地表现在他们对自己领袖毛主席的热爱与关怀。某院的志愿军伤员一入院，首先就写信给毛主席。信里报告了前方的胜利，报告了祖国人民欢迎和慰问他们的情况。并且表示决心：一定安心休养，争取早日回到前方和工作岗位去。最后要毛主席寄一张最近的照片给他们，让大家仔细看看自己敬爱的领袖。
    不久，毛主席的回信来了，并且寄来了最近的照片。这一下，哄动了整个医院。大家兴奋极了，把信和照片按床轮流传着看。大家看了又看，关心地议论着。有的人高兴地说：“毛主席胖了！”有的人却说：“没有胖，恐怕是工作太忙了——毛主席可别要太累了啊！”但另外也有人说：“咱们这么大个国家，每天该有多少事情啊，毛主席怎么也不肯休息的！”……
    总之，志愿军英雄们在负伤休养中，也在关心着国家，关心着自己的领袖。
