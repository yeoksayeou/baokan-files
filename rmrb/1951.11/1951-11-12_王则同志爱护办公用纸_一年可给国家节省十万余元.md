　　Comrade Wang Ze Cherishes Office Paper
    Saving the Country More Than 100,000 Yuan a Year
    I am a clerk in the Third Section of the Public Security Branch of the Shijiazhuang Railway Bureau. I have always not paid enough attention to office paper. When writing official documents or drawing forms, I would throw them away and replace them if they were bad, sometimes ruining three or four sheets in a row. Especially when printing things and making charts, I often carelessly ruined several large sheets of high-quality paper. This time, after seeing Chairman Mao's instruction in the newspaper at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which said that the central task of the Chinese people today is to increase production and practice strict economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers, I was deeply moved. I have always loved and respected the great leader Chairman Mao, and I will unconditionally obey his wise instructions and listen to him. So I made a self-criticism and made a statistic of my waste in the self-criticism. According to the past calculations of writing badly, drawing badly, and printing badly an average of one-fifth of a sheet of office paper every day in my work, then I would waste six sheets of paper a month, and seventy-two sheets of paper a year. A good sheet of high-quality paper costs 1,500 yuan on the market, and seventy-two sheets are worth 100,800 yuan. If there are 500,000 staff members across the country who waste as much as I do, then 5.4 billion yuan RMB, or even more, would be wasted a year. If this amount of money were used to resist the US and aid Korea and buy fighter planes, it would be enough to buy more than three planes. This number of waste is so shocking, but in the past I regarded it as "just a sheet of high-quality paper." Therefore, I am willing to take myself as a typical example to alert staff members across the country that they must cherish state property and be responsible for even a single sheet of paper.

　　王则同志爱护办公用纸
    一年可给国家节省十万余元
    我是石家庄铁路局公安分处第三科的办事员，一向对办公用纸不够重视，写公文，划表格，坏了就扔掉重换，有时一连搞坏三、四张。尤其是印东西和制图表，往往一不注意就将大张的粉莲纸印坏好几张。这次在报纸上看到毛主席在人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议上指示说，中国人民今天的中心任务，就是增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军。我深深地受了感动。我一向对伟大的领袖毛主席是热爱的、尊敬的，他的英明指示我要无条件地遵从，听他的话。于是我就作了一次检讨，在检讨中自己又作了一个浪费的统计。根据过去在工作中每天平均写坏、划坏、印坏五分之一张办公纸计算，那么一个月就要浪费六张纸，一年就要浪费七十二张纸；一张好粉莲纸市价一千五百元，七十二张就值十万零八千元。如以全国像我一样浪费的工作人员有五十万人，那么一年就会浪费五十四亿元人民币，或者比这个数字还高。以这笔款项去抗美援朝，买战斗机，足能买到三架多。这个浪费数字是如何的惊人，但在过去却被我看成“仅不过是一张粉莲纸”。所以我愿意拿自己作典型，提出来警惕全国工作人员，对国家财产一定要爱护，就是一张纸也要对它负责。
