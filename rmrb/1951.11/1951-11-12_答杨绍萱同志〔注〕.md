Reply to Comrade Yang Shaoxuan [Note]
  　Ai Qing
        We Are Not Discussing Mass Creation
    In our opera reform work, there is a serious tendency that violates historical materialism. This tendency, usually called "anti-historicism," involves, when dealing with historical themes and ancient folk tales, dragging characters and events that could only arise under certain historical conditions into the present, making far-fetched analogies, or forcibly placing concepts and emotions that could only arise today onto ancient characters. Therefore, a confusing phenomenon of being neither ancient nor modern has appeared on our opera stage. During the Ghost Festival (夏历七月节) this year, many such mythological dramas emerged across the country. Some depicted the Cowherd and Weaver Girl as being demoted to the mortal world and, after undergoing labor reform, becoming labor heroes and returning to heaven; some were because the Cowherd and Weaver Girl had strong labor viewpoints, and the two made a vow to meet once a year voluntarily; in some plays, the Cowherd wore worker's clothes, and the Weaver Girl wore student clothes; some thought that the theme of the original myth was not positive enough, so they fabricated many new plots in the play to insinuate the current domestic and international situation. In my
    "Talking About 'The Cowherd and Weaver Girl'" article, I pointed out these chaotic phenomena on the one hand, and on the other hand, I also put forward some suggestions for dealing with mythological dramas. Because if this chaotic phenomenon is not overcome, it will be very difficult to produce good mythological dramas.
    Comrade Yang Shaoxuan believes that I want to "uproot the people's opera and art movement." This accusation is too serious.
    Comrade Yang Shaoxuan pointed out that since the Chinese workers and peasants gained political liberation, "they truly have had art and opera reform movements. Therefore, land reform and resistance against America and aid to Korea have been processed into songs, novels, and even scripts and performed on the stage using all kinds of stories. These works, whether in terms of literary rhetoric or artistic form, are undoubtedly somewhat naive and crude. In the eyes of feudal scholar-bureaucrats or bourgeois writers, they would find them very vulgar and ridiculous, thinking they are 'difficult to be placed in high society.' The more this movement develops, the more dissatisfied they become."
    The meaning of this passage is nothing more than two points: opera reform is a mass movement, and their creations should be cherished and respected; and the current opera reform movement should not be judged from the perspective of feudal scholar-bureaucrats or bourgeois writers.
    However, today we are not discussing the issue of mass creation. We are discussing the attitude of Comrade Yang Shaoxuan, a person who holds an administrative position responsible for Chinese opera reform work, towards national heritage, creative methods, and literary criticism. We are not commenting on the programs of a certain primary school's parents' meeting or the performances of a certain worker's amateur troupe, we are commenting on the works of experts like Comrade Yang Shaoxuan. If Comrade Yang Shaoxuan regards those who offer opinions on his works as enemies, and considers all those who are dissatisfied with his works as feudal scholar-bureaucrats or bourgeois writers, what else is there besides blocking his own path forward? There is nothing else.
        "Changing the Appearance"
    Comrade Yang Shaoxuan said: "If you want to move, you have to change the appearance and become 'something else.' History and revolution are so ruthless, they don't care whether you are 'literature for literature's sake, mythology for mythology's sake' writers are willing or not, it's just a surge of energy changing..."
    We are not national essence advocates, nor are we conservatives. We advocate that a critical attitude must be adopted towards the national cultural heritage, and we also advocate that all folk tales should be sorted out and adapted. But we also advocate that a cautious and serious attitude must be adopted towards the national cultural heritage and folk tales, whether it is sorting out or adapting them. What we oppose is that kind of extremely reckless and arbitrary style of disposal.
    Comrade Yang Shaoxuan advocates "changing the appearance," and we completely agree; but we must study what Comrade Yang Shaoxuan has transformed the "Cowherd and Weaver Girl" myth into.
    Comrade Yang Shaoxuan has "created" many things in his "New Heavenly River Marriage." He uses this myth to promote "defending world peace." In the seventeenth scene of his script, ten scenes are about the struggle between the owl and the peace dove. He said: "The owl only implicitly contains general destructive elements, destroying people's happy marriages, destroying production relations, that is, destroying production, is an accomplice of feudalism, and naturally there may also be imperialism 'Truman' inside."
    Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's theory is: "In the great era of people's revolution, why is it not allowed to 'use mythology to insinuate reality' and create?" He also said: "You say that mythology cannot insinuate reality? I say it can. You say that it cannot reflect resistance against America and aid to Korea, defending world peace, etc.? I still say it can. This insignificant 'New Heavenly River Marriage' is his ironclad proof."
    Comrade Yang Shaoxuan is obviously saying that what he has done is right. This is too immodest.
    Let's not talk about the fact that there was no land reform like today in ancient times, and there was no such extremely vicious imperialism like today; let's also not talk about whether it is appropriate to use mythology to promote resistance against America and aid to Korea and defend world peace. Let's take a look at how Comrade Yang Shaoxuan promotes "defending world peace."
    Comrade Yang Shaoxuan uses the struggle between the owl and the peace dove to insinuate the struggle between the imperialist camp and the peace camp. Here, neither the owl nor the Queen Mother of the West has any of the fierce aggression and oppression that can express the nature of imperialism. The owl is only going to the Cowherd's house to cause trouble because of the condition of being enshrined by the elder, making "the family uneasy" (which is not specifically expressed on the stage), and the Queen Mother of the West only wants the Weaver Girl not to go down to marry the Cowherd, that's all. And this struggle is caused by the elder not being invited to drink wedding wine. Isn't this struggle like a child's play? Is imperialism like this? In Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's view, this struggle related to the fate of all mankind can be solved with just one "treasure arrow" and one "treasure shuttle" from the Weaver Girl. Isn't this making fun of politics? Comrade Yang Shaoxuan raised such a solemn question, but the answer to this question is so ridiculous!
    Comrade Yang Shaoxuan has "changed the appearance" of the theme and plot of the original myth in this way. And the original tragedy of opposing the feudal marriage system has been changed into a comedy. As everyone knows, the original myth was constructed by combining the changes in celestial phenomena. The Altair and Vega stars can only meet once a year. Now that the Cowherd and Weaver Girl are reunited, the myth has completely lost its basis.
    What I said "completely became something else" refers to things like Comrade Yang Shaoxuan kicking aside the original myth with one foot, the so-called "a surge of energy changing." Such things not only destroy the national cultural heritage but also distort and vulgarize our current political struggles.
    Art? Magic?
    Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's creative method violates realism. In his creation, the characters have neither a certain character nor a certain thought. Everything revolves around his own naive ideas and assumptions.
    In his "New Heavenly River Marriage," Comrade Yang Shaoxuan promotes the idea of opposing superstition. When the Cowherd's brother says "always choose a good day," the Cowherd's sister-in-law says: "You are still a bit superstitious, no day is better than today." When the uncle kicks the elder out, he says: "You old superstition, now you have to be overthrown..." This idea of opposing superstition is also held by the elder who relies on superstition for a living. When he prays to the Queen Mother, he says: "How can the Queen Mother speak, I am using the Queen Mother to deceive people, but I can't deceive myself..."
    But in the play, the Queen Mother appears. Since the Queen Mother is the idol worshiped by superstitious people, how can she really descend to the mortal world? How can she take the Weaver Girl from the mortal world back to heaven? Comrade Yang Shaoxuan first promotes to the masses that they should oppose superstition, and then promotes to the masses that
    "Gods do exist." Isn't that so?
    Under the magic pen of Comrade Yang Shaoxuan, this Queen Mother is once all-powerful and once helpless. When she wants to descend to the mortal world to capture the Weaver Girl, she can personally tie the Weaver Girl back without a single soldier; but when the old ox tells the Cowherd "when you get to the Clear Water Pond, if you see a white silk shirt on the shore, grab it, and the Weaver Girl will not be able to go to heaven, and the Queen Mother will be helpless," isn't she helpless? The ending of this play is that the owl is caught, and the Cowherd and Weaver Girl are reunited, isn't this Queen Mother also helpless?
    As for the Weaver Girl, when the Cowherd wants to save the dove, she says: "There are bows and arrows here, this arrow is made with divine needles, and it is sure to hit"; but after the Cowherd shoots the owl, she immediately says: "This is not good," "That owl is raised by the Queen Mother, this time it is hit by an arrow, it will definitely go to the Queen Mother to complain, if that Queen Mother descends from heaven, I am afraid that you and I will be separated." And when she is imprisoned by the Queen Mother, she has a "treasure shuttle" on her body, and she asks the dove to bring it to her sisters to weave a net to catch the owl.
    Comrade Yang Shaoxuan fabricated a story about the marriage of "old ox and broken cart" to symbolize the combination of "means of production and labor tools." He used the elder's mouth to praise his own "creation": "This is new."
    Although this matter is "new," it is also very difficult. Although the relationship between the old ox and the broken cart is very close, there may not necessarily be any feelings, because the broken cart is only a burden to the old ox no matter what. On the day of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl's wedding, the Cowherd's sister-in-law suddenly said: "Really, you always think about that old ox and broken cart, just do it like that, today let the old ox and the broken cart also get married, you two change clothes in the back."
    It is the same sister-in-law who, when her husband proposed to marry a wife for the Cowherd, said: "The brother's lifelong event can't be careless, we have to discuss it with him and ask his opinion." Now, in front of this old ox and broken cart who can recite Lu Xun's "fierce-browed, I coolly defy a thousand pointing fingers, head-bowed, like a willing ox I serve the children," she doesn't even talk about a little democracy, and simply issues an order to marry them. Of course, the old ox and the broken cart will not protest, because all of this is just a naive joke.
    Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's so-called "creation" is like this. Because his creative style is pieced together, there are many contradictions in it. He
    "created" such characters, like the faces reflected in a funhouse mirror, sometimes elongated, sometimes flattened, sometimes omnipotent, sometimes helpless, sometimes advocating democracy, sometimes advocating arranged marriages. We can imagine that Comrade Yang Shaoxuan had many conflicting thoughts when creating: he wanted to write a myth, but he was afraid of promoting superstition; he wrote about anti-superstition, but the plot could not move forward, and he still had to ask the Bodhisattva to come down; he wanted to write about love, but he was afraid of being ridiculed as "love between children," so he advocated production and placed the history of the development of production tools, the combination of means of production and labor tools; this was not enough, he was afraid of not being able to combine with the current realistic struggle, so he thought that he should write about resistance against America and aid to Korea, defending world peace... and so on. So art became magic, it seemed like there was everything inside, but in the end, there was nothing.
     "New Connotation," "New Language"
    Comrade Yang Shaoxuan casually quoted a passage from Marx to prove the theoretical basis for his "using new language and new connotation in dealing with mythological and historical plays." I have read it several times, but I have not seen any common points between Marx's words and his creation.
    The language used by Comrade Yang Shaoxuan when writing is the most chaotic language. In his script, there are mixed in clumsy old poems, vulgar and unbearable clichés, unnecessary dialects, and many grammatically incorrect so-called "new languages." Here are a few examples:
    I, Niu Dalang, work in farming, my parents have passed away, leaving me two brothers, married to Tian, also virtuous (probably a mistake for the word "wise"),
    Only my brother is not yet married, which makes me very worried...
    The front says "leaving me two brothers, married to Tian," people will think that the two brothers married one wife together, and the back says "brother is not yet married," which becomes a contradiction. Of course, Comrade Yang Shaoxuan means that the younger brother has not yet married, but the two brothers here really confuse people.
    Swallows fly in pairs in the shade of willows, the scenery is picturesque
    In the fields, there are all millet and sorghum mixed together. What a good "millet and sorghum mixed together"!
    The gentleman relies on the old ox and broken cart, working hard all year round, supporting this life... What does "supporting this life" mean? Other such as: "Specially causing trouble for others," "The woman calls her mother and tears fall like rain," "Affection is like the flower of spring," "A good marriage made in heaven is so happy"... it is really unbearable to read.
    Expel this kind of language from our literary works!
    What is the "new connotation" that Comrade Yang Shaoxuan is talking about?
    Comrade Yang Shaoxuan inserts many stiff preachings into the script. At the beginning of the script, it says: "Men cultivate and women weave, farming and mulberry, spring planting and autumn harvest, busy in all seasons, warmth and fullness all depend on labor, defending the country and building a family must be self-reliant." When the Cowherd comes on stage, he says: "The rooster knows how to crow, the old ox can pull the plow, men must have ambition, don't waste your youth." When the Cowherd proposes to the Weaver Girl, he says: "Just you have to start a family and establish a career with me." The Cowherd's brother returns from the field and says: "We can't finish eating this year's grain, our country is rich and our people are strong, ranking first." When the Weaver Girl praises the dove, she says: "...it is making contributions in the world...its ambition is bright and reaches the clouds..." Reading Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's preachings makes people feel like returning to the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China—it is too outdated. We don't know what era Comrade Yang Shaoxuan is praising?
    Comrade Yang Shaoxuan is so rudely dealing with the folk tale of "The Cowherd and Weaver Girl."
    "Crows" and "Magpies"
    Comrade Yang Shaoxuan said: "It is not others, but precisely Ai Qing himself who has truly blurred the clues of the original myth, especially blurred the meaning." To be honest, I don't have as much courage and "creative" talent as Comrade Yang Shaoxuan. Although I haven't read much to study this myth, I have also read the materials mentioned in Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's article. The stories I quoted were also copied from other people's works. This is not because I want to shirk the "crime" of "blurring the clues of the original myth," but I dare not take the beauty of others.
    Comrade Yang Shaoxuan said that I "wrote the crime of the Heavenly Emperor depriving the working people of their freedom of marriage on the account of the crow, that is, he personally transferred the crime of the reactionary rulers onto the heads of the people," "let the enemy go and blamed the people." I have committed a heinous crime! But I think the crows in the original story do not refer to the people. It is Comrade Yang Shaoxuan who takes crows as the people or takes the people as crows. In the traditional Chinese concept, crows are compared to disasters. The crow conveys the order of the Heavenly Emperor to notify the Cowherd and Weaver Girl, which is the role of a running dog.
    Comrade Yang Shaoxuan said that "magpies building a bridge so that the Cowherd and Weaver Girl can meet" is "ordained by the Queen Mother of the West." He also said: "If we say that magpies or all birds symbolize the masses, then these masses are suffering from the enslavement of the Queen Mother's feudalism. Isn't this myth clearly stamped with the brand of the feudal class? From this, it can be seen that the myth that Ai Qing likes, the so-called 'beautiful' 'extremely beautiful' that he appreciates, etc., are full of the suffering of the people." The meaning of Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's words is that I am appreciating the suffering of the people. Comrade Yang Shaoxuan just regarded crows as the people, and now he also regards magpies as the people. It is good to think of the people everywhere. But the Queen Mother ordained that magpies build a bridge, which is only Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's interpretation. My view is that magpies sympathize with the tragic fate of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl and build a bridge with the spirit of self-sacrifice so that the Cowherd and Weaver Girl can meet. Therefore, some legends say that magpies lose their hair on their heads after the Qixi Festival. But Comrade Yang Shaoxuan changed the magpies into peace doves, and since then
    "Magpie Bridge Meeting" has become "Dove Bridge Meeting."
    Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's Logic
    Comrade Yang Shaoxuan repeatedly mentioned historical materialism and dialectical materialism, meaning that he has already mastered the weapons of Marxism-Leninism. The fact is not so. Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's view on dealing with mythological dramas violates historical materialism. His non-realistic creative method, his theory, and the way of thinking he uses all run counter to Marxism-Leninism. Marxism-Leninism advocates seeking truth from facts, but Comrade Yang Shaoxuan seems dishonest everywhere.
    Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's attitude towards literary criticism is completely wrong. He thinks that he wrote about resistance against America and aid to Korea, and whoever criticizes him is against resistance against America and aid to Korea; he wrote about defending world peace, and whoever criticizes him is undermining world peace. Because I slightly mentioned Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's creation in my "Talking About 'The Cowherd and Weaver Girl'" article, Comrade Yang Shaoxuan gave me so many titles: "literature for literature's sake," "art for art's sake," "mythology for mythology's sake," "feudal scholar-bureaucrat," "bourgeois writer," even "serving Truman," "aiding the enemy," it is really a crime worthy of ten thousand deaths. This is of course only Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's logic, and this kind of logic is not popular in the revolutionary camp. In the revolutionary camp, any work needs to make progress through criticism and self-criticism. Even if the person who criticizes is so "incompetent and ignorant," it is okay to "listen" for a while. "A foolish person may have a good idea in a thousand considerations," this is a good tradition of our nation. I was originally a layman in opera, but when I saw some strange "creations" and could not control myself, I boldly put forward some opinions. What is wrong with this? I hope Comrade Yang Shaoxuan can learn a broad-minded style of "the speaker is not guilty, and the listener should take it as a warning." This will be beneficial to your work. In combat, we are against wasting bullets, so we can offer opinions on shooting that has not aimed at the enemy; we cherish the national heritage, so if someone paints some slogans on the Dunhuang murals, we will also oppose it. We rely on criticism and self-criticism to educate ourselves and make ourselves stronger and stronger. Like Comrade Yang Shaoxuan, for someone to mention the errors and shortcomings of his works, he immediately jumps up, even developing into an uncontrollable appearance, showing unparalleled confusion, irritability, and anger, which has actually begun to lose the most basic qualities of a revolutionary. I hope Comrade Yang Shaoxuan can be vigilant in time. [Note] The author's article was written in response to Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's attempt to defend his anti-historical tendencies in opera reform work. Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's original article "On the Harm of Literature for Literature's Sake and Art for Art's Sake" was published in this newspaper on November 3.

专栏：

    答杨绍萱同志〔注〕
  　艾青
        我们不是谈群众创作
    在我们的戏曲改革工作中，存在着一种严重地违反历史唯物主义的倾向。这种倾向，通常叫做“反历史主义”，就是当处理历史题材和古代民间传说的时候，把许多只能产生于一定的历史条件中的人物和事件，拉扯到现代来，加以牵强附会的比拟，或是把只能产生于今天的观念和感情，勉强安放到古代人物的身上去。因此，在我们的戏曲舞台上就出现了似古非古、似今非今的混乱现象。今年夏历七月节在全国各地涌现了许多这样的神话剧，有的把牛郎织女写成被贬下凡尘后，经过了劳动改造，成了劳动英雄回到天上去；有的是因为牛郎织女劳动观点强，二人订下盟誓，自愿一年见一次面；有的戏里牛郎穿工人服，织女穿学生服；有的以为原有的神话故事的主题不够积极，就在剧本里编造了许多新的情节，用以影射当前国内外的形势。我在
    “谈‘牛郎织女’”一文中，一方面指出这些混乱的现象，另一方面也提出了一些对处理神话剧的建议。因为这种混乱现象假如不加以克服，要产生好的神话剧是很困难的。
    杨绍萱同志认为我是想把“人民戏曲文艺运动连根子都拔了”。这罪名也太大了。
    杨绍萱同志指出，中国工农群众自从政治上获得解放后，“他们才真正有了文艺运动和戏曲改革运动。从而土地改革也好，抗美援朝也好，便就着各式各样的故事，处理成歌曲、小说、以至剧本而演出于舞台。这些作品，不管是文艺修辞或艺术形式，不消说有若干是很幼稚的和很简陋的。这在封建士大夫或资产阶级文学家们看来，会觉得是很粗俗的、很可笑的，以为‘难登大雅之堂’的。这个运动越发展，他们就越不满意。”
    这段话的意思不外是两种：戏曲改革是群众性的运动，对于他们的创作应该爱护和尊重；对目前的戏曲改革运动，不要用封建士大夫或资产阶级文学家的眼光来评判。
    但是，今天我们并不是谈群众创作的问题。我们谈的是像杨绍萱同志这样一个对中国戏曲改革工作负有行政职务的人对待民族遗产、创作方法以及文艺批评的态度的问题。我们并不是对某个小学的恳亲会的节目或是某个工人业余剧团的表演发表意见，我们是对像杨绍萱同志这样的专家的作品发表意见。假如杨绍萱同志把对自己作品提意见的人都看做是敌人，凡是对自己的作品有所不满的都是封建士大夫或是资产阶级文学家，这除了堵塞自己前进的道路之外还有什么呢？什么也没有了。
        “变样儿”
    杨绍萱同志说：“要动就要变样儿，成为‘另外一个东西’。历史与革命就是这样无情，它是不管你是什么‘为文学而文学、为神话而神话’文学家们愿意不愿意，它是一股劲儿在那里变……”
    我们不是国粹主义者，也不是保守主义者，我们主张对待民族文化遗产必须采取批判的态度，也主张对所有的民间传说加以整理和改编，但我们也主张对待民族文化遗产、民间传说无论是整理和改编都必须采取慎重的、严肃的态度。我们所反对的是那种极端轻率的、任意宰割的作风。
    杨绍萱同志主张“变样儿”，我们完全赞成；但我们却要研究一下杨绍萱同志把“牛郎织女”这个神话变成了什么样儿。
    杨绍萱同志在他的“新天河配”里“创造”了许多东西。他借这个神话宣传“保卫世界和平”。在他的剧本的十七场中，有十场是关于鸱枭与和平鸽之间的斗争。他说：“鸱枭只是涵蓄一般性的破坏分子，破坏人家的美满婚姻，破坏生产关系，亦即破坏生产，是封建主义的帮凶，自然里边也可能有帝国主义‘杜鲁门’。”
    杨绍萱同志的理论是：“在伟大的人民革命时代为什么就不许‘借神话影射现实’而加以创造呢？”他又说：“你说神话不能影射现实吗？我说能的。你说不能借神话反映抗美援朝、保卫世界和平等等吗？我还是说能的。这个微不足道的‘新天河配’就是他的铁证。”
    杨绍萱同志显然是说他做了的就是对的。这未免太不谦虚了。
    我们暂且不说古代既没有像今天这样的土地改革，没有像今天这样的穷凶极恶的帝国主义；我们也暂且不说借神话来宣传抗美援朝、保卫世界和平是否合适。我们不妨看看杨绍萱同志是怎样宣传“保卫世界和平”的。
    杨绍萱同志借鸱枭与和平鸽之间的斗争，来影射帝国主义阵营与和平阵营之间的斗争。这里，无论鸱枭也好，王母娘娘也好，都没有任何可以表现帝国主义性质的凶恶的侵略和压迫，鸱枭不过是受长老的供以神位的条件，到牛郎家去扰乱，使“家宅不安”（这在舞台上也没有什么具体表现），王母娘娘不过是要织女不下凡嫁给牛郎，如此而已。而这场斗争，是由于长老没有被邀请去喝喜酒所引起的。这斗争不等于是儿戏么？难道帝国主义是这样的么？这个关系全人类命运的斗争，在杨绍萱同志看来，只要织女的一支“宝箭”，一只“宝梭”，也就解决了问题。这不是拿政治开玩笑么？杨绍萱同志提出了何等庄严的问题，但这个问题的回答却又是何等滑稽！
    杨绍萱同志就是这样地，把原有神话的主题和情节都“变样儿”了。并且把原来的反对封建婚姻制度的悲剧，改成了喜剧。大家都知道，原来的神话故事是结合了天上星象的变化而构成的，牵牛星与织女星只能一年相会一次，现在牛郎织女既然团圆了，这个神话故事就完全丧失了根据。
    我所说的“完全成了另外的东西”，就是指像杨绍萱同志这样的把原有神话一脚踢开的，所谓“一股劲儿在变”的东西。这样的东西，不但是破坏了民族文化的遗产，也是把我们当前的政治斗争加以歪曲和庸俗化了。
    艺术呢？魔术呢？
    杨绍萱同志的创作方法，是违反现实主义的。在他的创作里，人物既没有一定的性格，也没有一定的思想。一切都跟着他自己的天真的构思和设想而打转。
    杨绍萱同志在他的“新天河配”里，宣传反对迷信的思想，当牛郎哥哥说“总要选一个好日子”的时候，牛郎的嫂嫂说：“你还是有点迷信，那天也不如今天好。”当舅爷把长老赶出来的时候他说：“你这老迷信，现在要打倒……”这种反对迷信的思想，就连靠迷信吃饭的长老也有，当他向王母娘祷告的时候，他说：“王母娘娘那儿会说话呀，我拿着王母娘娘骗人，我可不能骗我自己……”
    但在剧本里，王母娘娘出现了，王母娘娘既然是迷信者所供奉的偶像，她怎么又真的能下凡呢？她怎么又能把织女从人间捉回到天上去呢？杨绍萱同志是先向群众宣传应该反对迷信，再又向群众宣传
    “神是的确存在的”。难道不是这样么？
    在杨绍萱同志玩弄魔术的笔下，这个王母娘娘一下神通广大，一下又会变成毫无办法。当她要下凡捉织女的时候她可以不带一兵一卒亲身把织女捆绑回去；但当老黄牛告诉牛郎“你到了清水池边，看见岸上白罗衫儿，抢到手中，织女便不能上天，王母赶来，也就无济于事了”的时候，她不是毫无办法么？这个剧本的结尾是说鸱枭被捉住，牛郎织女团圆，这个王母娘娘不也是毫无办法么？
    至于织女，当牛郎要救鸽子的时候，她说：“这里现有弓箭，此箭乃用神针造成，百发百中”；但当牛郎射了鸱枭之后，她马上又说：“此事不好，”“那鸱枭乃王母所养，此番中箭，必去哀告王母，倘那王母下得天来，只怕你我夫妻就要被她拆散了哇。”而当她被王母囚禁的时候，身上又有了“宝梭”，托鸽子带给众姐妹为她织天罗地网，把鸱枭捕捉起来。
    杨绍萱同志编造了一个“老黄牛和破车”结婚的故事，用以象征“生产手段和劳动工具”的结合，他借长老的嘴，赞美自己的“创造”：“这倒新鲜。”
    这件事虽然“新鲜”，但却也很困难。老黄牛和破车的关系虽然很密切，却不一定会有什么感情，因为破车对老黄牛无论如何只是一种莫奈何的负累。当牛郎织女结婚那天，牛郎嫂嫂突然说：“真是的，你总惦着那老牛破车，就那么办，今天叫老牛和破车也结婚，你们后边换换衣裳。”
    就是这同一个嫂嫂，在他丈夫提出要给牛郎娶媳妇的时候，她曾说：“兄弟的终身大事，可不能麻胡，那得向他商量商量，问问他的意思才行。”现在她在这个能念鲁迅的“横眉冷对千夫指，俯首甘为孺子牛”的老黄牛和破车面前，却连一点民主也不讲了，索性下一道命令叫它们结婚。当然老黄牛和破车是不会有什么抗议的，因为这一切原不过是一些天真的笑话而已。
    杨绍萱同志的所谓“创造”就是这样。因为他的创作作风是七拼八凑的，所以里面矛盾百出。他
    “创造”了这样的一些人物，像哈哈镜里所照的脸形，一下拉长了，一下又成了扁的，一下万能，一下束手无策，一下讲民主，一下又主张包办婚姻。我们可以想像得到，杨绍萱同志在创作时，存在着许多矛盾心理：他想写神话故事，却又怕宣传了迷信；写了反迷信，情节不能向前发展了，还是要请菩萨下来；他想写爱情，却又怕被讥为“儿女之情”，于是提倡生产，把生产工具发展史、生产手段和劳动工具的结合都安放进去；这还不够，怕不能结合当前的现实斗争，于是想到应该写抗美援朝、保卫世界和平……等等。于是艺术成了魔术，里面好像什么都有，结果是什么也没有。
     “新涵义”、“新语言”
    杨绍萱同志随便地引了一段马克思的话，来证明自己在处理“神话剧历史剧运用新语言和新涵义”的理论根据，我是看了几次也没有看出马克思的话和他的创作之间有什么共同之点的。
    杨绍萱同志在写作时所采用的语言，是最混乱的语言。在他的剧本中，掺杂了拙劣的旧诗词，庸俗不堪的陈词烂调，不必要的土话，以及许多文法不通的所谓“新语言”。这里顺便举几个例子：
    我，牛大郎，务农为业，父母下世，剩我兄弟
    二人，娶妻田氏，倒也贤惠（恐系慧字之误），
    只有兄弟尚未婚配，叫我十分挂心……
    前面说“剩我兄弟二人，娶妻田氏”，人们会以为两兄弟合娶一妻，后面说“兄弟尚未婚配”，成了矛盾。当然杨绍萱同志的意思是指弟弟还没有娶妻，但这里的两个兄弟实在把人给搞糊涂了。
    柳阴中燕双飞风光如画
    田园内俱都是禾黍交加好一个“禾黍交加”！
    郎君靠着老牛破车，一年四季，辛苦劳作，支
    持了这个过活…… “支持了这个过活”不知是什么意思？其他如：“专向人家闹糟糕”、“女呼娘来泪如梭”、“恩爱好比春之花”、“天配良缘好快哉”……实在叫人看不下去。
    把这种语言从我们的文学作品中驱逐出去吧！
    杨绍萱同志所说的“新涵义”又是什么呢？
    杨绍萱同志在剧本中夹进了许多生硬的说教。剧本一开始就说：“男耕女织务农桑，春种秋收四季忙，饱暖全凭劳力取，卫国兴家得自强。”牛郎上场时说：“雄鸡知报晓，老牛能拖犁，男儿须立志，莫负少年时。”牛郎向织女求爱时说：“只是你要同我兴家立业。”牛郎哥哥从地里回来说：“今年粮食吃不了，我们国富民强属第一。”织女赞美鸽子时说：“……他在人间立功劳……志量光明达云霄……”读杨绍萱同志的这些说教，真使人产生回复到清末民初的感觉——太过时了。我们不知道杨绍萱同志所歌颂的究竟是什么时代？
    杨绍萱同志就是这样粗暴地处理“牛郎织女”这个民间传说的。
    “乌鸦”和“喜鹊”
    杨绍萱同志说：“真正模糊了原来神话的线索，特别是模糊了意义，不是别人，而恰恰是艾青自己。”老实说，我没有像杨绍萱同志那样大的胆量和“创造”的才能。为了研究这个神话传说，我看的东西虽然不多，但像杨绍萱同志文章中所提到的材料也都看过。我所引的故事，也是从别人的著作中抄下来的。这并不是我想卸什么“模糊了原来神话的线索”之“罪”，只是我不敢掠他人之美。
    杨绍萱同志说我“把天帝剥夺劳动人民婚姻自由的罪行写在了乌鸦的账上，即把反动统治者的罪行他亲笔转写在人民的头上”，“放走了敌人，加罪于人民”。我竟犯了弥天大罪！但是我想原来故事里的乌鸦，指的并不是人民。拿乌鸦当人民或是拿人民当乌鸦的是杨绍萱同志。在中国的传统观念里，乌鸦是比拟灾祸的。乌鸦衔天帝之命，通知牛郎织女，是一种狗腿子的作用。
    杨绍萱同志说：“喜鹊搭桥使牛郎织女能见面”是“王母娘娘圣旨钦定的”。又说：“如果说喜鹊或百鸟象征群众的话，那么这种群众是在受着王母封建主义的奴役呀。这个神话不明明是烙着封建阶级的烙印吗？由此可见，艾青所喜爱的神话，所欣赏的所谓‘优美’‘极美’等等，那里边是充满着人民的痛苦呀。”杨绍萱同志这段话的意思就是说我在欣赏着人民的痛苦。杨绍萱同志刚才把乌鸦当做人民，现在又把喜鹊也当做人民。能处处想到人民是好的。但喜鹊搭桥是由王母圣旨钦定，这也只是杨绍萱同志的解释。我的看法倒以为喜鹊同情牛郎织女的悲剧命运，以自我牺牲的精神来搭桥使牛郎织女相会的。所以有的传说中说喜鹊在七夕后头上脱毛。而杨绍萱同志却把喜鹊改成了和平鸽，从此
    “鹊桥相会”成了“鸽桥相会”了。
    杨绍萱同志的逻辑
    杨绍萱同志三番四复地提到历史唯物论和辩证唯物论，意思就是说他是已经掌握了马克思、列宁主义的武器的。事实却并不如此。杨绍萱同志对处理神话剧的观点是违反历史唯物论的。他的非现实主义的创作方法，他的理论和他所运用的思想方法，都是与马克思、列宁主义背道而驰的。马克思、列宁主义提倡实事求是，而杨绍萱同志却处处显得不老实。
    杨绍萱同志对待文艺批评的态度是完全错误的。他以为自己写了抗美援朝，谁批评，谁就是反对抗美援朝；写了保卫世界和平，谁批评，谁就是破坏世界和平。因为我在“谈‘牛郎织女’”一文中，轻微地提到了杨绍萱同志的创作，杨绍萱同志封给我多少的称号啊：“为文学而文学”、“为艺术而艺术”、“为神话而神话”、“封建士大夫”、“资产阶级文学家”、甚至“为杜鲁门服务”、“资敌”，真是罪该万死了。这当然只是杨绍萱同志的逻辑，这种逻辑，在革命阵营里是不流行的。在革命阵营里，任何工作都一样需要以批评和自我批评来取得进步。即使批评的人再多么“低能无知”，也不妨“倾听”一下。“愚者千虑，必有一得”这是我们民族的好传统。我对戏曲本来是外行，但当我看了一些奇特的“创造”而不能自己的时候，也就大胆提出一些意见。这有什么不可以呢？希望杨绍萱同志能学习一种“言之者无罪，闻之者足诫”的宽大风度。这对你的工作是会有好处的。在作战时，我们是反对浪费子弹的，因此我们对没有瞄准敌人的射击可以提意见；我们是爱护民族遗产的，因此假如有人在敦煌壁画上涂上一些标语，我们也要反对。我们就是依靠批评与自我批评教育自己并使自己日益坚强、日益壮大的。像杨绍萱同志那样，为了有人提到了他的作品的错误和缺点，马上暴跳起来，甚至发展到不可收拾的样子，显出了无比的混乱、烦躁、愤怒，实际上已经开始丧失一个革命者最起码的品质了。希望杨绍萱同志能及时警惕一下。〔注〕作者的这篇文章是为答复杨绍萱同志企图辩护他在戏曲改革工作中的反历史主义倾向而作。杨绍萱同志原文“论为文学而文学，为艺术而艺术的危害性”载十一月三日本报。
