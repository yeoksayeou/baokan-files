Grammar and Rhetoric Talks (Lecture 6)

            Section 5 Question Marks, Exclamation Points
    The Function of Question Marks. The main use of a question mark is to indicate that a sentence is a question. For example:
    (1) How could I have a relative like you? Is your surname Zhao? (Lu)
    (2) Have you seen it? Is this it? These are four question sentences, all marked with question marks. In example (1), the first sentence contains the interrogative pronoun "how," and the second sentence ends with the interrogative particle "么 (me)." In example (2), the second sentence has the interrogative structure "是不是 (shì bù shì - is/are not)." However, the first sentence of example (2) has neither an interrogative pronoun, nor an interrogative particle, nor an interrogative structure; if there were no question mark, it would not be possible to indicate that this is a question sentence. (In the era before punctuation, this sentence would have to use the word "吗 (ma).")
    When to Use Question Marks? There are several types of sentences where it's worth considering whether or not to use question marks. The first type is a question sentence used as the object of a verb, for example:
    (3) And I didn't know what Ah Q's surname was. (Lu)
    (4) Let me go and see if he has come. These are clearly not asking for an answer. Although the second half is in the form of a question sentence, the entire sentence is not a question sentence and can only use a period, not a question mark. However, some sentences, although taking the same form, actually require the other party to answer, then a question mark should be used. For example:
    (5) I would like to ask, how exactly should this character be written?
    (6) I haven't read this book, I wonder if you have?
    The second type is a question sentence used as the subject of a sentence, for example:
    (7) Whether this approach is correct is worth studying. Although the first half of this sentence is a question sentence, it is only part of the whole sentence, so "是否对 (shì fǒu duì - whether correct)" does not need a question mark at the end. But if the tone is relaxed, and it is said in two sentences, then the first sentence can use a question mark at the end. Such as:
    (8) Is this approach correct or not? We should study it further.
    The third type are some "formal" question sentences, which actually do not require an answer, so there is no need to use a question mark. For example:
    (9) Who knows he has already left. If it carries a sense of exclamation or disappointment, an exclamation point can be used. If it is said plainly, a period can be used. But definitely not a question mark, because it is not asking "who" knows.
    The fourth type is alternative questions. Although these sentences have a particle and a pause in the middle, they must be combined with the second half to become a complete question sentence: then, a question mark should not be used in the middle. For example:
    (10) Are we going today, or tomorrow? But if they are treated as two parallel question sentences, then two question marks can still be used. For example:
    (11) Are we going today? Are we going tomorrow? I'm a little undecided.
    The Position of the Question Mark. We often call someone's name first, then ask them a question, like "Wang Jiajun, are you going to the movies?" But sometimes, we ask the question first, then call the name, and the question mark should still be placed at the end. The punctuation in (12) below is correct, and (13) is wrong:
    (12) "What's up, old man?" Captain Xiao asked. (Book)
    (13) Who are you talking about? Little Fuzi! (Work)
    Question Marks Indicate "Doubt" and "Unknown." In addition to being used at the end of a sentence, a question mark can also be placed after a word or phrase to indicate doubt about it; or it can be placed in the position of a word or phrase to indicate that it is unknown. For example:
    (14) Only the Terrace City, hangs the setting sun, the water far (circling?) the mountain surrounds. (Book)
    (15) Sparse forest evening crows, gather to watch (? ) distant shores, falling geese cold sands. (Book)
    (16) Wei Yingwu (736-790?)
    (17) Luo Nie (825-?) (14) means "the word '远 (yuǎn - far)' is suspected to be a mistake for the word '绕 (rào - circle)'." (15) means "the word '看 (kàn - watch)' is suspected to be a mistake," but it is impossible to guess which word is the mistake. (16) says that there is doubt about the statement that Wei Yingwu died in 790. (17) says that Luo Nie's "year of death is unknown."
    The Function of Exclamation Points. Exclamation points are used to indicate strong emotions when speaking, used at the end of a sentence or after incomplete phrases. For example:
    (18) Long live the great People's Republic of China! Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people!
    (19) Ah, how abundant these gifts are! (Lu)
    (20) "Ah Q, you little rascal!..." (Lu)
    (21) "Alas, alas!..." he said. (Lu) (18) is a slogan. (19) is a genuine exclamatory sentence (all those using adverbs such as "多么 (duōme - how)" and "何等 (héděng - what)"). (20) is an incomplete exclamatory phrase. (21) are two interjections.
    When to Use Exclamation Points? Unlike question marks, the use or non-use of exclamation points, using them more or less, has a lot of flexibility. Let's look at a few situations. First, if there is an interjection at the beginning, and an exclamatory sentence underneath, should an exclamation point be used in both places? Or only at the end? Similarly, when using two interjections in a row, are two exclamation points used, or just one? According to the examples of (19) and (21), only one is used, placed at the end. But there are also cases where they are used in both places.
    Secondly, we know that in addition to genuine exclamatory sentences, declarative sentences, imperative sentences, and interrogative sentences can all be used as exclamatory sentences. For example:
    (22) "Wow, Ah Q, you're back!"
    "Back."
    "Prosperity, prosperity, you are--at..."
    "Gone to town!" (Lu)
    (23) "It's still early, sleep a little longer!" she said in alarm.
    ……………………………
    "It's still early, sleep a little longer," she said, while raising her eyes, looking at the sky above the dilapidated roof with an unspeakable expression. (Lu)
    (24) "Amitabha, Ah Q, why did you jump into the garden to steal radishes!..."
    "When did I jump into your garden to steal radishes?" Ah Q said as he watched and walked. (Lu) (22) has two declarative sentences, "回来了 (huílái le - back)" and "上城去了 (shàng chéng qù le - gone to town)," both are Ah Q's answers to the shopkeeper, one with an exclamation point, one without. This indicates that one sentence was said calmly, and the other was said triumphantly. (23) is excerpted from "The Trembling of the Decaying Line," the same imperative sentence separated by four lines, used an exclamation point the first time, and not the second time. Just paying attention to the additional explanations of "said in alarm" and "looking...at the sky with an unspeakable expression," it can be seen that the presence or absence of this exclamation point is not necessarily accidental. Some people misunderstand that all imperative sentences must use exclamation points, which is not necessarily the case. (24) is a question and a rhetorical question, one with an exclamation point, one with a question mark. The old nun's question does not necessarily not require Ah Q to answer, but the emotion is strong, so an exclamation point is used. Ah Q's answer also does not necessarily require the old nun to answer, it is actually just a kind of "evasion," but he is not confident and his voice is not strong, "said as he watched and walked," so only a question mark is used.
    Thirdly, we often greet the other person first, then speak. This "vocative" noun can be followed by an exclamation point, or not. For example:
    (25) Uncle! When are we coming back? (Lu)
    (26) Sister Xianglin, let it be! I'll take it. (Lu) Generally speaking, exclamation points are not used often. (Compare examples 20, 22, 24.)
    "!?" "!!" "!!!" Question sentences are often used as exclamatory sentences, and sometimes it's hard to decide whether it's more question or more exclamation, so some people use the "!?" sign. This still doesn't solve the problem, because in this way, almost all question sentences used as exclamatory sentences can use this symbol. It's still better to choose one of these two symbols.
    Some people also use two or three exclamation points to express particularly strong emotions. Mostly in stacked sentences, for example: "Arise! Arise!! Arise!!!" A single use of two exclamation points can be said to be nonexistent, a single use of three exclamation points is occasionally seen, such as:
    (27) "Dao Weng!!!" Si Ming shouted indignantly. Dao Tong stopped smiling after being shouted at. (Lu) Whether stacked or used alone, it is best to use them sparingly, using them excessively will have no effect.
    Critical Exclamation Points. Sometimes in the middle of quoting someone else's words, an exclamation point enclosed in parentheses is inserted to indicate disagreement or dissatisfaction. This is similar to using a question mark to indicate doubt. For example:
    (28) Why does the old form only "adopt"—but Mr. Er Ye pointed out that it was "cheering for the entire (! ) old art"—it is for the exploration of the new form. (Lu)

　　语法、修辞讲话（第六讲）
    吕叔湘、朱德熙
            第五段  问号、叹号
    问号的作用。  问号的主要用处是表示一句话是问话。例如：
    （一）我怎么会有你这样的本家？你姓赵么？（鲁）
    （二）你看见过？这个是不是？这里有四个问句，都用问号标明。例（一）的第一句中间有疑问代词“怎么”，第二句末了有疑问语气词“么”，例（二）的第二句有疑问格式“是不是”。但是例（二）的第一句就是既没有疑问代词，也没有疑问语气词，也没有疑问格式；倘若没有问号，就不能表示这是个问句。（在没有标点符号的时代，这一句就非用个“吗”字不可了。）
    用不用问号？  有几类句子，是否该用问号，值得考虑。第一类是用一个问句做某一动词的宾语，例如：
    （三）而我并不知道阿Ｑ姓什么。（鲁）
    （四）让我去看看，他来了没有。这些都是明明不要求回答的。虽然底下的一半是问句的形式，整个句子并不是问句，只能用句号，不能用问号。但是有些句子，虽然也采取同样形式，实际上是要求对方回答的，那就应该用问号。例如：
    （五）我倒要请教，这个字到底应该怎么写？
    （六）这本书我可没有看过，不知道你看过没有？
    第二类是用一个问句做一个句子的主语，例如：
    （七）这样做法是否对，是值得研究的。这一句的上半句虽然是个问句，可是它只是整个句子的一部分，所以“是否对”底下不用问号。可是如果语气舒缓，说成两句，第一句末了就又可以用问号了。如：
    （八）这样做法对不对呢？我们应该再研究一下。
    第三类是一些“形式”问句，实际是不要求回答的，那也就不必用问号。例如：
    （九）谁知道他已经走了。如果带惊叹或失望的情绪，可以用叹号。如果平平地说，可以用句号。但决不能用问号，因为不是问“谁”知道。
    第四类是抉择式问句。这种句子的中间虽然有语气词，有停顿，可是一定要合下半句才成为一个完整的问句：那末，中间不应该用问号。例如：
    （十）今天去呢，还是明天去？可是如果作为两个并列的问句，那还是可以用两个问号。例如：
    （十一）今天去呢？明天去呢？我倒有点决断不下。
    问号的位置。  我们常常先叫一个人的名字，然后问他一句话，象“王家骏，看电影不看？”可也有时候，先问话，后叫名字，问号还是应该放在末了。下面（十二）的标点是对的，（十三）是错的：
    （十二）“怎么的，你老人家？”萧队长问。（书）
    （十三）你说的是谁啊？小福子！（作）
    问号表示“有疑问”与“不明”。  除了用在一句的末了，问号还可以放在某一词语的后面，表示对它有疑问；或是放在某一个词语的地位上，表示不知道。例如：
    （十四）惟有台城，挂残阳水远（绕？）山围。（书）
    （十五）疏林暮鸦，聚看（？）远浦，落雁寒沙。（书）
    （十六）韦应物（七三六——七九○？）
    （十七）罗邺（八二五——？）（十四）的意思是“远字疑是绕字之误”。（十五）的意思是“看字疑有误”，但不能拟测是何字之误。（十六）是说韦应物死在七九○这个说法有疑问。（十七）是说罗邺“卒年不详”。
    叹号的作用。  叹号用来表示说话时带强烈的情感，用在一句之末或不成句的词语之后。例如：
    （十八）伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！中国共产党万岁！中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
    （十九）阿，这赠品是多么丰饶啊！（鲁）
    （二十）“阿Ｑ，你这浑小子！……”（鲁）
    （二十一）“唉，唉！……”他说。（鲁）（十八）是口号。（十九）是本来的感叹句（凡用“多么”“何等”等副词的都属于这一类）。（二十）是不成句子的感叹语。（二一）是两个叹词。
    用不用叹号？  叹号和问号不同，用与不用，多用少用，大有伸缩。我们拿几种情形来看看。第一，头上有个叹词，底下是个感叹句，是不是两处都要用叹号？还是只用在末了？同样，连用两个叹词的时候，是用两个叹号，还是只用一个？照（十九）和（二一）的用例，是只用一个，放在末了。但是也有两处都用的。
    其次，我们知道，除本来的感叹句外，直陈句、命令句、问句，全都能用来做感叹句。例如：
    （二二）“嚄，阿Ｑ，你回来了！”
    “回来了。”
    “发财发财，你是——在……”
    “上城去了！”（鲁）
    （二三）“还早哩，再睡一会罢！”她惊惶地说。
    ……………………………
    “还早哩，再睡一会罢。”她说着，同时抬起眼睛，无可告诉地一看破旧的屋顶以上的天空。（鲁）
    （二四）“阿弥陀佛，阿Ｑ，你怎么跳进园里来偷萝卜！……”
    “我什么时候跳进你的园里来偷萝卜？”阿Ｑ且看且走的说。（鲁）（二二）有两个直陈句，“回来了”和“上城去了！”，都是阿Ｑ回答酒店掌柜的话，一个加叹号，一个不加。这表示这两句话一句是平平和和地说的，一句是得意洋洋地说的。（二三）是“颓败线的颤动”里摘录下来的，相隔四行的同一命令句，第一回用叹号，第二回不用。只要留心一下“惊惶地说”和“无可告诉地一看……天空”这两处附加说明，就可以知道这叹号的有无不见得是偶然。有人误会，凡是命令句都要用叹号，实在并不一定。（二四）一问一反问，一用叹号，一用问号。老尼姑的问，不一定不要求阿Ｑ回答，但是情感强烈，所以用了叹号。阿Ｑ的回答，也不一定要求老尼姑回答，其实只是一种“遁词”，不过理不直，气不壮，“且看且走的说”，所以只用了个问号。
    其次，我们常常先向对方招呼一声，然后说话。这个“呼格”名词，可以加叹号，也可以不加。例如：
    （二五）大伯！我们什么时候回来？（鲁）
    （二六）祥林嫂，你放着罢！我来拿。（鲁）一般地说，不加叹号的多。（比较二十、二二、二四诸例。）
    “！？”“！！”“！！！”  问句常常用做感叹句，有时候决断不下到底是问多于感，还是感多于问，有人就用上个“！？”号。这也还是不解决问题，因为这样一来，几乎所有用做感叹句的问句都可以用这个符号。还是应该在这两种符号里选择一种。
    又有人为了表示感情的特别强烈，用两个叹号和三个叹号。多半是在叠句的时候，例如：“起来！起来！！起来！！！”单独用两个叹号的可说没有，单独用三个叹号的间或还有，如：
    （二七）“道翁！！！”四铭愤愤的叫。道统给这一喝，不笑了。（鲁）无论叠用或单用，都以少用为宜，用滥了反而没有作用了。
    批评性的叹号。  有时候在引用别人的话中间，插进一个用括号括起的叹号，表示不同意或不满。这是跟用问号表示有疑问相类似的用法。例如：
    （二八）旧形式为什么只是“采用”——但耳耶先生却指为“为整个（！）旧艺术捧场”——就是为了新形式的探求。（鲁）
                                              （本段完，全文未完）
