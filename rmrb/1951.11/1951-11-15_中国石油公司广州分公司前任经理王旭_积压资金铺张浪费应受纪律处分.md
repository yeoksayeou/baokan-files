Wang Xu, former manager of the Guangzhou Branch of China Petroleum Corporation, violated cash management and foreign exchange usage regulations, causing losses to state assets.

In November of last year, Wang Xu, relying solely on the verbal agreement of Zhou Jiada, Director of the Guangzhou Foreign Trade Administration, and without applying for approval from the South China Financial and Economic Committee, under the pretext of a certain company purchasing gasoline and empty oil drums on his behalf, instructed staff to dress in plain clothes and withdraw 1 billion yuan (RMB) in cash from the Guangzhou Branch of the People's Bank of China. This amount was then deposited into the Guangzhou Foreign Trade Administration's vault (910 million yuan) and the company's vault (90 million yuan), where it was held for over two months before being deposited into the bank in January of this year. This action seriously violated the cash management system.

In May of last year, the Guangzhou Foreign Trade Administration, in order to stabilize petroleum prices, prepared to purchase a batch of petroleum. Wang Xu allocated 2 billion yuan, entrusting a certain company to purchase oil. The company quoted prices several times, but Wang Xu considered them higher than the market price and was unwilling to buy. Within three months, the company did not purchase a single barrel of oil, resulting in the 2 billion yuan being tied up for three months.

On July 19th of last year, the Central and Southern Region Company of China Petroleum Corporation allocated 830,000 yuan in foreign exchange to the Guangzhou Branch. Wang Xu had the funds transferred from the People's Bank to the Petroleum Company's account, but did not begin to use them until September 9th, holding them for 50 days. This coincided with a rate adjustment, resulting in a difference loss of 5 billion yuan. It is true that it was difficult to purchase oil at the time and the foreign exchange could not be used immediately. However, Wang Xu underestimated the situation at the time and his own purchasing capacity. Since he could not purchase a large amount of oil, he should have returned part or all of the foreign exchange, rather than transferring it all to the Petroleum Company's account, bearing interest in vain. This violated the foreign exchange management and usage regulations stipulated by the Central Trade Department, resulting in the accumulation of foreign exchange and a loss due to the rate decline.

From December of last year to January of this year, China Petroleum Corporation telegraphed the branch nine times to stop purchasing petroleum and complete the sales plan. After receiving the first telegram, Wang Xu delayed notifying them for eight days. Li Mu, the director of the Huizhou Office under the branch, continued to purchase oil after the higher-level stop-purchase instruction was issued. The prices on the invoices exceeded the market price by a significant margin, and the petroleum, with a capacity of 50 gallons per barrel, was calculated at 60 gallons, exceeding the listed price by 510,000 yuan per barrel, causing the branch to lose 535.5 million yuan. Wang Xu did not promptly inspect or stop this malicious behavior of over-reporting oil quantities and taking profits from it.

Wang Xu lived an extravagant and wasteful life and engaged in corrupt practices such as falsely reporting, over-reporting, and double-reporting expenses. In October of last year, he went to Beijing for a meeting and received 20 million yuan in travel expenses. After returning 15 million yuan in cash and transfer slips, he used the remaining 5 million yuan to report travel expenses, purchase expenses, and entertainment expenses, and falsely reported over 2 million yuan in the so-called purchase and entertainment expenses. In addition, Wang Xu also illegally accepted gifts, such as pens, watches, and cameras given by the Huizhou Office.

Zhou Jiada, Director of the Guangzhou Foreign Trade Administration, lacked timely inspection and correction of Wang Xu's errors. After Wang Xu's mistakes were discovered, Zhou Jiada removed him from his position as manager of the Guangzhou Petroleum Branch, but then transferred him to the Guangzhou Foreign Trade Administration as the director of the office. This unprincipled accommodation and use of cadres objectively contributed to Wang Xu's mistakes. After a thorough investigation by the Central and Southern People's Supervision Committee, the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in the Central and Southern Region, and other departments, Wang Xu and others will be given disciplinary actions.

### 中国石油公司广州分公司前任经理王旭  积压资金铺张浪费应受纪律处分

　　中国石油公司广州分公司前任经理王旭
    积压资金铺张浪费应受纪律处分
    中国石油公司广州分公司前任经理王旭，违反现金管理和外汇使用办法，使国家财富遭受损失。
    去年十一月，王旭仅凭广州对外贸易管理局局长周嘉达口头同意，没有申请华南财政经济委员会批准，即假借某公司代购汽油和空油桶名义，指派职员，换上便衣，向人民银行广州分行提取现金十亿元（人民币），分别存入广州市对外贸易管理局金库（计九亿一千万元）及该公司金库（计九千万元），积压两个多月，于今年一月存入银行。这种行为，严重地违反了现金管理制度。
    去年五月，广州对外贸易管理局为了平稳石油价格，准备收购一批石油。王旭拨款二十亿元，委托某公司代购油料。该公司数次报价，王旭都认为比市价高，不愿购买，三个月内，该公司未买到一桶油，结果将二十亿元资金积压了三个月。
    去年七月十九日，中国石油公司中南区公司拨给广州分公司外汇八十三万元。王旭将该款由人民银行转入石油公司账下，到九月九日才开始动支，积压达五十天。那时正遇到牌价调整，致低差五十亿元。当时购油困难，一时不能将外汇使用出去，确系事实。但王旭对当时情况及本身收购能力估计不足，既无法购入大批油料，就应将外汇缴回一部或全部，不应将其悉数转入石油公司户下，空负利息。这就违背了中央贸易部规定的外汇管理及使用办法，积压了外汇，并因牌价下调，造成低差损失。
    去年十二月到今年一月，中国石油公司曾九次电告该分公司停购石油，完成销售计划。王旭接到第一次电报后，压了八天，才通知下去。该分公司所属惠州办事处主任李木在上级停购指示发出后，仍继续收购，所开发票价格超过市价很远，并将每桶五十加仑容量的石油，按六十加仑计算，每桶超过牌价五十一万元，使分公司损失五亿三千五百万元。这种多报油量，从中取利的恶劣行为，王旭没有及时检查制止。
    王旭生活上铺张浪费，且有虚报、多报、重报账目的贪污行为。去年十月，他到北京开会，领旅费二千万元，除缴回现金与转账单据一千五百万元外，其余五百万元，分为旅费、购置费和交际费报销，并在所谓购置和交际费中，虚报、假报二百多万元。此外，王旭并曾非法接受馈赠，例如，接受惠州办事处馈送的钢笔、手表、照像机等。
    广州对外贸易管理局局长周嘉达对王旭的错误行为，缺乏及时检查与纠正。当王旭所犯错误被发现后，周嘉达虽撤去他广州石油分公司经理的职务，却又调他到广州对外贸易管理局当办公室主任。这种无原则的迁就和使用干部的行为，客观上助长了王旭的错误。此案经中南人民监察委员会、中共中央中南局纪律检查委员会等部门彻查后，将分别予王旭等以纪律处分。（武汉记者站）
