Soviet Experts Help China in Agricultural Construction

For the past two years, Soviet experts have made great contributions to the recovery and development of agricultural production in our country. Soviet agricultural experts have provided a great deal of assistance to our country in planning agricultural construction, formulating agricultural production plans, and improving cultivation systems and techniques.

Soviet experts have introduced many Soviet experiences to help us plan agricultural construction, thereby promoting the rapid recovery and development of agricultural production in our country. In terms of agricultural science and technology, the advanced experiences of deep plowing, close planting, crop rotation, rational irrigation and fertilization introduced by Soviet experts have made great contributions to improving agricultural technology in our country. For example, the cotton close planting method and the rice close planting method introduced by Soviet experts have achieved excellent results in increasing yield per unit area. Qu Yaoli, a Shanxi agricultural labor model, had a bumper cotton harvest this year by using the close planting method. The Shuangqiao State Farm in Beijing, under the direct guidance of Soviet expert Lysenko, implemented cotton close planting, planting more than 4,000 plants per mu, resulting in a doubling of yield per mu. Agricultural cadres from all over the country who came to Beijing to attend meetings, after visiting the Shuangqiao Farm, all believed that close planting is an effective method to increase cotton yield per unit area in the future. The implementation of the rice close planting method in the Bohai rice area of North China has resulted in a new record of more than 1,000 catties of rice per mu in the Bohai area. The pasture rotation system introduced by Soviet experts, after trials in state farms, has proved that the implementation of pasture and grain crop rotation can not only increase soil fertility, but also eliminate weeds in the fields. More importantly, the yields of various Soviet crops introduced by Soviet experts, such as a maximum cotton yield of 1,889 catties per mu, a maximum wheat yield of 1,350 catties per mu, and a maximum rice yield of 1,975 catties per mu, have provided a direction for increasing production in the future for Chinese agriculture, and have enhanced the confidence of the Chinese people in striving to increase yield per unit area.

In terms of animal disease prevention, Soviet expert Bandarenko helped China eliminate the foot-and-mouth disease of livestock, which had almost spread throughout the country, this spring; and introduced methods of cattle hide disinfection and vaccination with "Korofong" foot-and-mouth disease vaccine, and helped China formulate various veterinary disease prevention regulations and implementation measures for rinderpest prevention. On the issue of preventing animal diseases, Soviet experts helped China reverse the past view of simply relying on injections for prevention, and thus adopted measures such as strict disinfection and isolation in epidemic areas, and earnest disposal of diseased animal carcasses to directly eliminate germs and prevent transmission.

In terms of animal husbandry: Last year, China imported a large number of high-quality breeding animals from the Soviet Union, and Soviet expert Troitsky personally helped China establish breeding animal farms and guided the feeding and management of breeding animals. The Soviet method of artificial insemination to breed high-quality livestock has been effectively implemented in our country. The Keshan County Breeding Animal Farm in Heilongjiang, Northeast China, used artificial insemination technology this year to increase the mating ability of stallions by three times, and the conception rate of mares reached 85 percent, more than double that of the enemy and puppet period.

Soviet experts Marakhtanov and Churnikov, Petrov, also systematically introduced to China the experience of operation and management and organizational operation methods of Soviet state farms. This is of great help to China in operating state farms and future agricultural mechanization. Last winter, Soviet experts personally lectured at the winter training class for staff of state farms of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, correcting the past incorrect idea that state farm personnel only valued mechanical technology and ignored agricultural technology, and clarified the view that agricultural machinery must be subordinate to agricultural technology. Soviet experts have also provided great assistance to China in the manufacture of agricultural machinery. The animal-powered four-row seeder manufactured by the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory was designed with the help of Soviet expert Kuzletsov.

Soviet agricultural experts have demonstrated a high degree of internationalism in assisting China's agricultural construction. They care about China's construction as much as they care about the construction of their own motherland. This year, China used airplanes to spray pesticide powder to control locusts for the first time. Soviet expert Lysenko not only helped design and install the aircraft spraying device, but also went to Huanghua, Hebei Province, and other places several times to participate in locust control. When he heard that cotton aphids had occurred at the Shuangqiao Farm, he hurried to the site to study and guide aphid control. Soviet expert Troitsky insisted on teaching and compiling teaching materials when he was ill while giving courses at the animal husbandry and veterinary work training class in Chabei.

    苏联专家帮助我国进行农业建设
    两年来，苏联专家对我国农业生产的恢复和发展有很大的贡献。在规划我国的农业建设、制订农业生产计划，以及改进耕作制度和提高耕作技术等方面，苏联的农业专家们，都给了我国很多帮助。
    苏联专家介绍了很多苏联的经验，帮助我们规划农业建设；从而促进了我国农业生产的迅速恢复和发展。在农业科学技术方面，苏联专家们介绍的深耕、密植、轮作、合理灌溉和施肥等先进经验，对于提高我国的农作技术贡献很大。例如：苏联专家介绍的棉花密植法和水稻密植法，在提高单位面积的产量上，已经有了优异的成效。山西农业劳动模范曲耀离今年棉花丰产，就是采用的密植法。北京双桥国营农场在苏联专家卢森科的直接指导下实行棉花密植，每亩种四千多株，结果每亩产量提高了一倍。全国各地到北京开会的农业干部，参观双桥农场后，都认为密植法是今后提高棉花单位面积产量的有效方法。水稻密植法在华北渤海水稻区实施的结果，已使渤海区出现了每亩产一千多斤稻子的新纪录。苏联专家介绍的牧草轮作制，经国营农场试验，证明实行牧草和粮食作物轮作，不仅可以增进土壤肥力，而且能够消灭田间杂草。更重要的是苏联专家介绍的苏联各种农作物的产量，如棉花每亩最高产一八八九斤，小麦每亩最高产一三五○斤，水稻每亩产一九七五斤等，给我国农业提示了一个今后增产的方针，增强了我国人民努力提高单位面积产量的信心。
    在兽疫防治方面，苏联专家班达林柯，今春帮助我国消灭了几乎蔓延全国的牲畜口蹄疫；并介绍了牛皮消毒和接种“可罗封”口蹄疫苗等防疫的办法，帮助我国拟订了各种兽疫防治法规和牛瘟防治的实施办法。在防治兽疫的问题上，苏联专家帮助我国扭转了过去单纯依靠注射预防针的观点，从而采取了在发病地区执行严格的消毒、隔离，和认真处理病畜尸体等直接消灭病菌，杜绝传播的措施。
    在畜牧方面：去年我国从苏联输入了大批优良种畜，苏联专家特罗依茨基又亲自帮助我国建立种畜场，指导种畜的饲养管理工作。苏联的人工授精繁殖优良牲畜的方法，已在我国施行有效。东北黑龙江克山县种畜场，今年运用人工授精技术，使种马的交配能力提高了三倍，母马的受孕率达到了百分之八十五。较敌伪时期超过一倍。
    苏联专家马拉贺他诺夫和邱尔尼克夫、彼罗夫，还给我国有系统地介绍了苏联国营农场的经营管理经验和机构作业的方法。这对我国经营国营农场和将来农业机械化的帮助极大。去年冬天，苏联专家亲自给中央人民政府农业部国营农场职工冬季训练班讲课，纠正了过去国营农场人员只重视机械技术、忽视农业技术的不正确思想，明确了农业机械必须服从农业技术的观点。在农业机械制造上，苏联专家给我国的帮助也很大。华北农业机械总厂制造的畜力四行播种机，就是在苏联专家库兹列卓夫帮助下设计造成的。
    苏联农业专家在协助我国的农业建设上，表现了高度的国际主义的热忱。他们关心我国的建设像关心自己的祖国的建设一样。今年我国首次运用飞机喷撒药粉治蝗。苏联专家卢森科不仅帮助设计按装飞机喷粉器，而且几次到河北省黄骅等地参加治蝗。当他听到双桥农场发生棉蚜的时候，就赶忙跑去实地研究和指导治蚜。苏联专家特罗依茨基在察北担任畜牧兽医工作讲习会的课程时，生了病还坚持上课和编讲义。（新华社）
