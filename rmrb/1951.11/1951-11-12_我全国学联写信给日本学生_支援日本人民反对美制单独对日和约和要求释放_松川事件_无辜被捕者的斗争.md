　　All-China Student Federation Writes to Japanese Students
    Supporting the Japanese People's Struggle Against the US-Imposed Separate Peace Treaty with Japan and to Demand the Release of Innocent Arrestees in the "Matsukawa Incident"

     [By Our Correspondent] The All-China Student Federation wrote to Japanese students on the 11th of this month, supporting the Japanese people and students in their struggle against the US-imposed separate peace treaty with Japan and demanding the release of innocent arrestees in the "Matsukawa Incident." The original letter is as follows:
    To the All-Japan Student Self-Government Association Federation,
    Dear Japanese students:
    Recently, we have been continuously reading in the People's Daily the letters from comrades Saito Sen, Kobayashi Genzaburo, and others, the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident," to the people of our country. The heroic and unyielding fighting spirit of the Japanese people deeply moves us. On behalf of Chinese students, we extend our cordial greetings and highest respect to the twenty Japanese patriotic workers who were innocently arrested in the "Matsukawa Incident," and to the Japanese people and students who are fighting against the US-imposed separate peace treaty with Japan and demanding the release of innocent arrestees in the "Matsukawa Incident!"
    The shameless verdict of the Fukushima District Court on the "Matsukawa Incident" fully exposes the crimes of US imperialism and the Yoshida reactionary government in persecuting the Japanese people. However, we believe that the brutal suppression by the US-Japanese reactionaries can never subdue the heroic Japanese people. The Chinese people and students stand with you in your struggle for democracy and independence and against the rearmament of Japan by US imperialism. We will further strengthen the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to support your struggle.
    We firmly believe that, encouraged by the powerful world peace movement, and under the victorious situation in which the Chinese and Korean people are heavily striking the American aggressors, the Japanese people and students will unite more widely to fight against the US-imposed separate peace treaty with Japan, for Japan's independence and democracy, and will achieve final victory in the struggle.
    People and students of China and Japan unite!
    Fight for the release of the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident!"
    Oppose the US-imposed separate peace treaty with Japan! Oppose the rearmament of Japan!

                    All-China Student Federation

　　我全国学联写信给日本学生
    支援日本人民反对美制单独对日和约和要求释放“松川事件”无辜被捕者的斗争
     【本报讯】中华全国学生联合会于本月十一日写信给日本学生，支援日本人民和日本学生反对美制单独对日和约和要求释放“松川事件”无辜被捕者的斗争。原信如下：全日本学生自治会联合总会转亲爱的日本同学们：
    最近我们在人民日报上连续读到“松川事件”无辜被告斋藤千、小林源三郎等同志给我国人民的来信，日本人民英勇不屈的斗争精神，使我们深深感动。我们谨代表中国学生，向“松川事件”无辜被捕的二十名日本爱国工人，向正在为反对美制单独对日和约和要求释放“松川事件”无辜被捕者而斗争的日本人民和日本学生致以亲切的慰问和崇高的敬意！
    福岛地方裁判所对“松川事件”的无耻判决，充分暴露了美帝国主义和吉田反动政府迫害日本人民的罪行。但是，我们相信：美日反动派的残酷镇压，是决不能够使英勇的日本人民屈服的。中国人民和学生在你们争取民主独立、反对美帝国主义重新武装日本的斗争中，是和你们站在一起的。我们将进一步加强抗美援朝运动来支援你们的斗争。
    我们深信：在世界人民强大的和平运动的鼓舞下，在中朝人民沉重地打击着美国侵略者的胜利形势下，日本人民和日本学生将更加广泛地团结起来，为反对美制单独对日和约，为争取日本的独立和民主而斗争，并将在斗争中得到最后的胜利。
    中日两国人民和学生团结起来！
    为“松川事件”无辜被告的释放而斗争！
    反对美制单独对日和约！反对重新武装日本！
                    中华全国学生联合会
                    一九五一年十一月十一日
