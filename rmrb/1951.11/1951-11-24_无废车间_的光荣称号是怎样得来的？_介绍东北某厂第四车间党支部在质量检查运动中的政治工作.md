　　How the Glorious Title of "Waste-Free Workshop" Was Obtained?
　　-- Introducing the Political Work of the Fourth Workshop Party Branch of a Factory in Northeast China in the Quality Inspection Campaign
Editor's Note: The experience of the Fourth Workshop Party Branch of a factory in Northeast China in leading the quality inspection campaign shows that the key to making a production campaign a mass movement lies in doing a good job of the Party's political work. This experience is worth noting in various localities.
　　In carrying out the quality inspection campaign, the Fourth Workshop of a factory in Northeast China, due to the attention paid by the workshop Party branch to the political work of the workers, ensured the smooth development of the campaign, completely eliminated defective products, and won the glorious title of "Waste-Free Workshop." On this basis, the campaign for increased production and thrift was smoothly launched.
　　At the beginning of the quality inspection campaign, the Party branch of the Fourth Workshop determined that strengthening the ideological education of all workers was the key to doing a good job of the quality inspection campaign. Therefore, the branch first convened an enlarged meeting of the branch committee to unify the leading ideology of the Party, the administration, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League, and to establish a common concept of responsibility for product quality inspection. At that time, the thinking of the workers in the entire workshop was relatively chaotic. Generally, difficulties such as "few technicians, many apprentices, imprecise machines, and unqualified materials" were emphasized; some showed satisfaction with the existing achievements, believing that "the quality is just like this, there is no way to improve it further." Or they would say: "If you want quality, don't talk about quantity; if you want quantity, don't restrict quality. There is no such thing as having both." Or they thought that quality inspection was just about finding faults and not solving problems. Or there was a "getting through" mentality towards quality inspection, trying to avoid it. These ideas seriously hindered the development of the quality inspection campaign. After the branch discovered these ideological situations, it first analyzed and criticized them at the branch committee meeting, unified understanding, and then convened a meeting of Party members, League members, and worker activists to mobilize everyone to conduct propaganda and explanation to the workers, and correct these erroneous ideas. At the same time, branch committee members were assigned to go deep into the site, assist Party members, League members, and worker activists to investigate the causes of defective products, and discuss improvement methods with everyone. When defective products occurred in the first shift, the branch committee immediately mobilized everyone to investigate and study, and finally found that the defective products appeared because the cutting tools that should have been replaced were not replaced. The branch then used this concrete example to explain to the workers that a moment of negligence would damage the interests of the country. It called on everyone to regard the factory as a battlefield and production as fighting a war; carelessness was not allowed, otherwise they would fail. Through vivid and powerful example education, the erroneous thinking of the workers who excessively emphasized objective difficulties without thinking of solutions was overcome. Everyone was made to believe that as long as they made subjective efforts, the quality of products could be improved. As a result, many people responded: Many defective products like this had been produced in the past, but the reasons were not found; in the future, they must think of solutions subjectively.
　　In order to consolidate the workers' production enthusiasm and lay a solid political foundation for the quality inspection campaign, the branch led all employees to revise the patriotic pact. Improving product quality was included as one of the contents of the patriotic pact. Before revising the patriotic pact, ideological mobilization was first carried out, focusing on the fact that eliminating defective products and ensuring quality was a practical action to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. In the revision of the patriotic pact, the branch paid attention to the specific division of labor with cadres from the administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League systems, and went deep into the groups to provide specific assistance. Party members and League members led all employees to propose individual plans, which were finally adopted after several discussions and revisions. The branch adopted this mass line leadership method, which not only enabled all employees to consciously and voluntarily implement the patriotic pact, but also further improved the workers' political consciousness.
　　During the campaign, the branch committee members went deep into each shift to summarize typical experiences and promote them comprehensively. When it was discovered that the defect rate of a certain product in a certain shift was reduced from 1% to 0.2%, and finally defective products were eliminated; when a new record of doubling the output of a certain product after completely eliminating defective products was achieved, the branch committee members immediately summarized their experience and promoted it, so that the entire workshop found a way to eliminate defective products.
　　The branch also used wall newspapers, blackboards, defective product platforms, exhibitions, honor rolls, cartoons, etc., to carry out propaganda and mobilization work. After defective products were discovered, the quantity of losses, the causes of the losses, and the damage to national construction were publicized using various propaganda tools and various propaganda forms to educate everyone. In this way, the political sense of responsibility and enthusiasm of the workers in the entire workshop were improved, and the quality of products was guaranteed.
　　Under the promotion of the branch, all the workers in the Fourth Workshop finally achieved the complete elimination of defective products in production and created a "waste-free workshop." The campaign for increased production and thrift was launched on this basis.

　　“无废车间”的光荣称号是怎样得来的？        
     ——介绍东北某厂第四车间党支部在质量检查运动中的政治工作
    编者按：东北某工厂第四车间党支部领导质量检查运动的经验说明，要使生产运动形成群众性的运动，关键在于作好党的政治工作。这一经验值得各地注意。
    东北某工厂第四车间在开展质量检查运动中，由于车间党支部注意了对职工的政治工作，保证了运动的顺利开展，彻底消灭了废品，获得了“无废车间”的光荣称号。并在这一基础上顺利地展开了增产节约运动。
    第四车间的党支部在质量检查运动开始时，便认定加强全体工人的思想教育工作，是搞好质量检查运动的关键。因此支部首先召开支部委员扩大会议，统一党和行政、工会、青年团的领导思想，树立共同对产品质量检查的负责的观念。当时全车间工人的思想是比较混乱的。一般是强调“技工少，徒工多，机器不精密，材料不合规格”等困难；有的则表现了满足于已有的成绩，认为“质量就是这样啦，没法再提高”。或者说：“要质量就别讲数量，要数量就别限制质量，那有两全其美的事。”或者认为质量检查是专找毛病，不解决问题。或者对质量检查存在着“过关”思想，设法躲过这一关。这些思想严重地阻碍着质量检查运动的开展。支部发现这些思想情况后，首先在支委会上进行分析批判，统一了认识，然后召开党员、团员及工人积极分子会议，动员大家向工人群众进行宣传解释，纠正这些错误思想。同时支部委员分工深入现场，协助党员、团员和工人积极分子，调查产生废品的原因，和大家商定改进的方法。当第一班发生废品后，支部委员即发动大家调查研究，终于发现了因为该换的刀具没有换，以致出现了废品。支部便通过这一具体事例，向工友们说明，一时疏忽，就会损害国家利益。号召大家要把工厂当战场，生产比作打仗；决不能粗心大意，否则就要失败。通过生动有力的实例教育，克服了工人群众中过分强调客观困难，而不多想办法的错误思想。使大家相信了只要主观上努力，产品质量是可以提高一步的。这一来，很多人反应：象这样的废活，过去产生过很多，就是没有找出原因来；今后一定要从主观上去想办法。
    支部为巩固工人的生产热情，给质量检查运动打下稳固的政治基础，便领导全体职工修订爱国公约。将提高产品质量当作爱国公约内容之一。在修订爱国公约之前，首先进行了思想动员，着重说明了消灭废品、保证质量就是抗美援朝的实际行动。在修订爱国公约中，支部注意了与行政、工会、青年团各系统的干部实行具体分工，深入小组进行具体帮助。由党员、团员带动全体职工提出个人计划，经过几次讨论修改最后通过。支部采用了这种群众路线的领导方法，不但使全体职工能够自觉自愿地执行爱国公约，同时也进一步提高了工人政治觉悟。
    支部委员在运动中，又深入到各班去总结典型经验，全面推广。当发现某班某种产品的废品率，由百分之一降低到百分之零点二，最后消灭了废品；某种产品，完全消灭了废品后，又增加了一倍产量的新纪录时，支部委员即总结他们的经验，加以推广，使全车间找到了消灭废品的方法。
    支部又利用壁报、黑板报、废品台、展览会、光荣榜、漫画等，进行宣传鼓动工作。在发现废品后，便将损失的数量和造成损失的原因，以及对国家建设的损害，使用各种宣传工具，采用各种宣传形式进行宣传，以教育大家。这样，就提高了全车间工人的政治责任心与积极性，保证了产品质量。
    在支部的推动下，第四车间全体工人，终于作到了在生产中全部消灭废品，创造了“无废车间”。增产节约运动就在这一基础上展开了。
