    Local Newspapers Should Systematically Publicize the Huai River Project
    The Huai River Project is one of the great constructions since the establishment of New China two years ago. It has fundamentally changed the situation of "major floods after heavy rain, minor floods after light rain" suffered by the people on both sides of the Huai River during the old Chinese ruling period, and thereby achieved this year's bumper harvest. The People's Daily's reports on this great project are relatively systematic and complete. However, some local newspapers still lack systematic and in-depth publicity of this great project, so that many people do not yet understand its greatness. I suggest that local newspapers and magazines should publish more photos and diagrams related to the Huai River Project
    (with detailed explanations in plain language), and systematically publish reports on the Huai River Project, so that the people of the whole country can more universally recognize the greatness of the Huai River Project and the loveliness of the motherland.

    各地报刊应系统地宣传治淮工程
    治淮工程是新中国建立二年来的伟大建设之一。它已从根本上改变了淮河两岸人民在旧中国统治时期所遭受的“大雨大灾、小雨小灾”的状况，并从而获得今年的丰收。人民日报对于这个伟大工程的报道，是比较系统完整的。但有些地方报纸对这一伟大的工程，还缺乏系统的深入的宣传，致使不少人还不了解它的伟大之处。我建议各地报纸杂志，应多多刊登一些有关治淮工程的照片和示意图
    （用通俗文字加以详细说明），并系统地刊载有关治淮工程的报道，使全国人民更能普遍地认识治淮工程的伟大和祖国的可爱。
