Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 23rd—Inspired by patriotic enthusiasm, the people of the East China region have exceeded their six-month donation plan for airplanes and cannons ahead of schedule. As of now, the actual donations paid by the people of the entire region have reached 1,402.7 billion yuan, exceeding the original donation plan of 897 fighter planes, 33 cannons, 17 anti-aircraft guns, and 3 tanks. Among them, the donations from the people of Zhejiang Province, Northern Jiangsu Region, Northern Anhui Region, Nanjing City, and Shanghai City have all exceeded the original donation plan. The people of Shandong Province, Fujian Province, Southern Jiangsu Region, and Southern Anhui Region, who have not yet completed the original donation plan, are striving to complete the six-month donation plan in early December.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 23rd—The people of Shanxi Province have completed the original six-month plan to increase production and donate 30 fighter planes. As of November 19, the people of the province had paid more than 46.99 billion yuan in donations, exceeding the original plan by more than 4%.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 23rd—The people of Chahar Province completed the revised six-month plan to donate 10 fighter planes ahead of schedule. As of November 15, the total amount of donations paid reached more than 18 billion yuan, exceeding the revised plan by 20%.

The original plan of the people of Chahar Province was to increase production and donate 16 fighter planes and 3 cannons in six months. Since August, they have suffered consecutive severe droughts, insect plagues, wind, and frost disasters. The Chahar Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Chahar Provincial People's Government immediately proposed to the people of the province, based on the specific situation, that in addition to the unchanged donation tasks in the cities, the rural areas would no longer emphasize completing the donation plan. In mid-September, the Chahar Provincial Anti-American and Aid-Korea Sub-Committee revised the donation plan based on the disaster situation, determining that Zhangjiakou, Datong, and Xuanhua cities would be the main focus, and the province would strive to complete the plan to donate 10 fighter planes. However, the farmers of Chahar Province, filled with high patriotic enthusiasm, still actively donated, and the Chahar South Special Region was the first to complete the plan for the "Dong Cunrui" aircraft.

    华东全区人民提前超额完成捐献计划
    山西捐献计划超额完成、察哈尔完成修订的捐献计划
    【新华社上海二十三日电】华东区人民在爱国热情的鼓舞下，提前超额完成了半年捐献飞机大炮的计划。截至目前止，全区人民实缴献款达一万四千零二十七亿多元，超过原订认捐战斗机八百九十七架、大炮三十三门、高射炮十七门、坦克三辆的捐献计划。其中浙江省、苏北区、皖北区、南京市、上海市人民的献款都已超过原订捐献计划。未完成原订捐献计划的山东省、福建省、苏南区和皖南区人民争取在十二月初旬，完成半年捐献计划。
    【新华社太原二十三日电】山西省人民已完成半年增产捐献战斗机三十架的原订计划。截至十一月十九日止，该省人民已缴纳献款四百六十九亿九千余万元，超过原计划百分之四强。
    【新华社张家口二十三日电】察哈尔省人民提前完成半年捐献十架战斗机的修订计划，至十一月十五日止，缴款总数达一百八十亿余元，超过修订计划百分之二十。
    察哈尔省人民原计划在半年中增产捐献战斗机十六架，大炮三门。自八月以后，接连遭受严重的旱、虫、风、冻灾害。中国共产党察哈尔省委员会和察哈尔省人民政府当即根据具体情况，向全省人民提出除城市捐献任务不变外，农村不再强调完成捐献计划的建议。九月中旬，察哈尔省抗美援朝分会根据灾情修改了捐献计划，确定以张家口、大同、宣化三市为主，全省争取完成捐献十架战斗机的计划。但充满着高度爱国热情的察哈尔省农民，仍积极捐献，察南专区并首先完成了“董存瑞”号飞机一架的计划。
