    Workers of the Second Branch of the Beijing Machine Factory
    Improve Technology and Launch a Production Increase and Thrift Campaign
    Editor: In response to Chairman Mao's call, our factory has launched a production increase and thrift campaign.

    The iron casting department of our factory, which makes mine car wheels, has increased production from over 110 per day to over 200. They proposed that producing one more wheel is equivalent to adding one more contribution to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. The workers who make molds and the workers who soak iron hoops in this department also started a competition. The workers who soak iron hoops could not originally supply enough iron hoops for making molds. They devised a method to make a small pool under the soaking pool, which ensured the supply of iron hoops. In this way, the number of molds made per person per day increased from seven to eleven. The workers who make stove pieces did not want to fall behind, and also increased production from 48 pieces per day by 20 people to 60 pieces. Originally, the scrap rate for stove pieces was very high. After research by workers such as Huang Xiushan, the quality of the stove pieces was improved. The yield rate increased from 22 percent to 85 percent.

    Due to the enthusiasm of the workers in our factory, the production increase and thrift campaign has been enthusiastically launched in our factory. This campaign has received strong support and encouragement from the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League, and the workers' morale is very high.

    北京机器厂第二分厂职工
    改进技术展开增产节约运动
    编辑同志：我厂为了响应毛主席的号召，已展开了增产节约运动。
    我厂铸铁部做矿车轮，由每天一百一十多个，增加到二百多个，并提出多生产一个活，就多增加一份抗美援朝的力量。该部做模子的工人和浸铁圈的工人也挑起了竞赛。浸铁圈的工友原来供不上做模子的铁圈，他们想办法在浸水池下边做了一个小池子，就保证了铁圈的供应。这样，由每人每天做七个模子增到十一个。做炉片的工友也不愿落后，也从每二十人每天铸造四十八片，增加到六十片。原来生产炉片的废品率很高，经过工友黄秀山等的研究，炉片质量提高了。成品率从百分之二十二提高到百分之八十五。
    由于我厂职工发挥了积极性，增产节约运动在我厂已热烈展开。这个运动得到了党、行政、工会、青年团的大力支持与鼓励，工友们的情绪很高涨。
