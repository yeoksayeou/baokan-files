　　Circular from the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and the All-China Students' Federation
    on Commemorating the Sixteenth Anniversary of the "December 9th" Movement

    The sixteenth anniversary of the "December 9th" Movement is approaching. The youth of the entire country, especially young intellectuals, students, and Communist Youth League members in schools, should enthusiastically commemorate this glorious festival.

    Sixteen years ago, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the "December 9th" Movement set off a high tide of the Chinese people's resistance to Japan and national salvation, becoming the prelude to the great War of Resistance Against Japan. It also mobilized and educated a vast number of young people to participate in the armed struggle against Japan and the creation and construction of anti-Japanese democratic base areas, pointing out the correct path for students to combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers in the Chinese revolution. Today, as we commemorate this festival, we must inherit the patriotic tradition of the "December 9th" Movement, carry forward the spirit of the youth and students of the "December 9th" era in combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers, follow the resolutions of the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, actively participate in the ideological remolding movement, and strive for resisting America, aiding Korea, increasing production, practicing economy, and for defending and building our great motherland.

    The local Communist Youth League committees and student federations and student union organizations should, around December 9th, use gatherings and other appropriate forms to conduct publicity among the broad masses of youth and students on the significance of commemorating the "December 9th" Movement. They may also invite intellectuals who participated in the "December 9th" Movement and the revolutionary student movement after the "December 9th" Movement to talk about their own experiences in combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers and their own ideological remolding process. The student federations at all levels, the student unions of various schools, and the Communist Youth League organizations in schools should also pay attention to commemorating the "December 9th" Movement by implementing the spirit of the resolution of the 15th National Student Congress to further strengthen patriotic and internationalist self-education.

                      November 14th

    十六年前的“一二·九”运动，在中国共产党的领导下，掀起中国人民抗日救国的高潮，成为伟大的抗日战争的序幕，并且发动和教育了广大青年参加抗日的武装斗争，和抗日民主根据地的创造与建设工作，指出了中国革命的学生和工农兵结合的正确道路。今天我们纪念这个节日，就是要继承“一二·九”运动的爱国主义传统，发扬“一二·九”时代青年学生和工农兵结合的精神，遵行中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议的决议，学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，积极参加思想改造运动；为抗美援朝、增产节约，为保卫与建设我们伟大的祖国而奋斗。
    各地青年团团委和学生联合会、学生会的组织，应在十二月九日前后，以集会和其他适当的形式，向广大青年和学生进行纪念“一二·九”运动意义的宣传，并可邀请曾参加“一二·九”运动和“一二·九”运动以后的革命学生运动的知识分子，讲述他们自己和工农兵结合的经过与自己思想改造的过程。各地学联、各校学生会和学校中青年团的组织，并要注意以贯彻全国学生第十五届代表大会决议的精神，来纪念“一二·九”运动，进一步加强爱国主义与国际主义的自我教育。
