    Belgian Association for the Defense of Peace Chairman Max Cosyns
    Writes to Chairman Mao Expressing the Belgian People's Desire for Peace
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Belgian Association for the Defense of Peace wrote to Chairman Mao, expressing the Belgian people's desire for the conclusion of a peace pact among the five major powers and the prohibition of atomic weapons. The letter is as follows: To His Excellency Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China, Beijing:

    Recent events concerning the atomic bomb have once again made the issue of banning atomic weapons a paramount and urgent matter.

    Our association is leading our country's movement to strive for the conclusion of a peace pact among the five major powers. Our association firmly believes that if the conclusion of a peace pact can be realized, then the atomic bomb issue, which so seriously threatens humanity, can also be resolved accordingly.

    Therefore, we are enclosing our association's resolution, hoping that through the efforts of peace fighters worldwide, a peace pact can be concluded.

    Please accept our highest respects.
                   Max Cosyns, Chairman of the Belgian Association for the Defense of Peace
                           Brussels, October 10, 1951
