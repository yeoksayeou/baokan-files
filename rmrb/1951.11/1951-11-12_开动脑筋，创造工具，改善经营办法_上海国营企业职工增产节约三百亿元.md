Use Your Brains, Create Tools, Improve Management Methods
Shanghai State-Owned Enterprise Workers Increase Production and Practice Economy by 30 Billion Yuan

Shanghai's state-owned trading enterprises' workers, through movements such as Resisting America and Aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, have unprecedentedly raised their class consciousness and actively improved management and increased production and practiced economy, achieving remarkable results. According to preliminary statistics, in the past year, the workers of various state-owned trading enterprises in Shanghai have saved more than 30 billion yuan in wealth for the country.

　　Pang Binglian, a technical cadre of the East China Grain Company, with the help of workers from the Victory Electric Refrigerator Factory, created a "centrifugal insecticide machine." This insecticide machine can eliminate insect infestation and caking during flour storage. Ding Dade, director of the No. 10 warehouse of the Shanghai Grain Company, created the "open-air granary" and "electric rice sieving machine." The "open-air granary" overcomes the difficulty of having more grain than storage; the "electric rice sieving machine" is twice as efficient as the previously improved foot-operated rice sieving machine. Bai Daxi of the East China Coal Industry Construction Company invented a "coal thermometer" to measure the temperature of coal and prevent it from heating up and deteriorating. Xie Zhongxian created a "theoretical price coefficient table" to simplify accounting procedures. Accounts that previously required specialists can now be calculated by everyone; calculating theoretical prices, which used to take sixteen minutes, now takes half a minute.

　　The Customs Declaration and Transportation Section team of the Shanghai Import and Export Company adopted the "original car crossing the rails" method to transfer imported materials, saving more than 120 million yuan in handling and wharfage fees. The insurance section team of the company suggested determining insurance conditions according to the nature of the materials, saving 3.1 billion yuan in insurance premiums on two imports alone. The Wang Xiangcheng team of the East China Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company improved the loading technology, changing the past flat loading method to a roof-shaped loading method, saving vehicles and 180 million yuan in freight in five months. The storage and transportation room team of the East China Salt Industry Company suggested adopting the "direct loading" method for all salt transshipped to Shanghai, saving more than 74 million yuan in half a year.

　　When the Shanghai Trade Trust Company's rubber organization's commissioned agent placed orders with manufacturers, it carefully calculated costs and cooperated with relevant parties to repeatedly conduct on-site tests, saving 7,128,322,250 yuan in material usage. The transportation section team of the East China Petroleum Company carefully calculated when transporting equipment and oil, trying to make the loading capacity close to the railway bureau's regulations, and directly transported the equipment from the ship to the car at one time, saving more than 40 million yuan. The Yangshupu transportation team of the Shanghai Petroleum Company improved technical equipment and carefully calculated, saving more than 3,000 liters of gasoline in four months.
