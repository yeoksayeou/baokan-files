In Nanjing, a few students in secondary schools and above hold incorrect attitudes toward learning. They think: "Learning is a personal matter. My dad told me to come to school. The purpose of learning is to become a 'specialist' so I can earn more money." Therefore, some cram books, don't care about politics, and are even arrogant and unable to unite with their classmates. Others say: "Learning is a necessary path in life. I don't seek fame or fortune, I just need to pass with sixty points." Therefore, they don't care about anything and are sloppy in their studies. Among progressive students, some also hold this view: "Work is for the revolution, learning is for oneself," therefore "work comes first, learning comes second." They are enthusiastic about work, but their studies are terrible.

The above ideas have hindered the progress of many students. Since the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, this situation has changed through patriotic ideological education. In particular, since the promotion of the Patriotic Pledge movement in April and May this year, some schools have shown a new face.

As of September, 70% of secondary schools and above in Nanjing have established school-wide Patriotic Pledges, and the vast majority have also established Patriotic Pledges by department, grade, and class. Many students have also made personal plans. Some units, such as Nanjing University Affiliated High School, East China Pharmaceutical College, Municipal No. 1 High School, Nanjing University's Department of Chemical Engineering, and Department of Political Science, have done a relatively good job in formulating and implementing Patriotic Pledges, and the Patriotic Pledges have played a significant role in promoting learning. These units conducted full deliberation and discussion in the process of formulating and inspecting the Patriotic Pledges. First, they made everyone clearly understand the relationship between the individual and the motherland, criticized various incorrect learning attitudes, and recognized that learning is a glorious task assigned to students by the motherland, and studying hard is the practice of patriotism, thus greatly increasing the enthusiasm for learning. They studied the main shortcomings in learning in each class and for each person, proposed improvement methods, and included them in the Patriotic Pledges and personal plans. For example, after formulating the Patriotic Pledge, the first-year students of the Higher Vocational Department of East China Pharmaceutical College corrected the class's lax and undisciplined phenomenon; students with good grades sincerely helped students with poor grades; and it was no longer considered "shameful" for some students to ask others for help when they had difficulties. As a result, the class's academic performance improved significantly. Before formulating the Patriotic Pledge, many students in the Department of Political Science at Nanjing University were unwilling to study politics, so they were not at ease in their studies and wanted to transfer to other departments. In the process of formulating the Patriotic Pledge, everyone discussed the connection between studying politics and the needs of the country and realized the importance of studying politics. On the one hand, they actively made suggestions to professors to improve teaching; on the other hand, they organized various research groups to strengthen extracurricular learning activities, and now they can generally study with peace of mind. After formulating Patriotic Pledges and personal plans, many students have strengthened the planning of their studies and overcome the past chaos. Zhu Jiazhen, the study minister of the Student Union of Nanjing University Affiliated High School, arranged her study and work time well after formulating the Patriotic Pledge, and her exam score last semester reached more than 91 points (in the past it was always in the 80s).

Since the establishment of the Patriotic Pledges, the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic education in many units has become regularized. They stipulated a system of current affairs learning in the Patriotic Pledges, and some also established reading and research groups to overcome the tendency of "not caring about national affairs." The senior first class of East China Pharmaceutical College proposed in the Patriotic Pledge that each person should write a letter of慰问慰问 (consolation and appreciation) to the Volunteers every month. When writing letters, they all combined it with checking their own learning, work, and ideological situation in the past month and reported it to the Volunteers. In this way, each letter made them receive a good patriotic education.

The Patriotic Pledges have also promoted students to regularly participate in sports and cultural and recreational activities, thereby improving students' health. In the past, many people in Nanjing University Affiliated High School did not participate in sports and recreational activities, and the responsible students of the Student Union's recreation and sports department were very troubled by this. Since "strengthening physical exercise, paying attention to hygiene, and carrying out recreational and sports activities" was stipulated in the Patriotic Pledge, every time there were sports activities and cultural and recreational activities, 100% of the students in the school participated. Tang Xiao, a student at the school, used to be afraid of being laughed at because he was not good at participating in sports activities, so he always made excuses not to participate. After formulating the Patriotic Pledge, he mustered up the courage to participate in activities with his classmates, and now he has learned several sports skills, and his body is healthier than before.

The unity and mutual assistance between teachers and students and between students have also improved with the formulation of the Patriotic Pledges. The Patriotic Pledges have also enriched the work content of the school's Communist Youth League and the Student Union. Facts have proved that, like for people from all walks of life, the Patriotic Pledges are also a good form for the vast number of students and teachers to conduct self-education. However, the leadership of many schools has not yet fully recognized the importance of this work, and therefore has not led this work well. The Patriotic Pledges in many units have not played their due role, which must be strived to improve in the future.

### 爱国公约引导同学们前进

    爱国公约引导同学们前进
    南京市的中等以上学校里，有少数同学抱有一种不正确的学习态度。他们认为：“学习是个人的事情。进学校是爸爸叫我来的。学习的目的是为了当‘专家’，可以多拿钱。”因此，他们有的啃死书，不关心政治，甚至自高自大，和同学闹不团结。有的却说：“学习是人生必经的途径。我不求名，不求利，只要啃它六十分就行了。”因此，他们对什么事情都是满不在乎，学习功课也是马马虎虎。在进步同学中间，也有人抱着这种看法：“工作是为革命，学习是为个人”，因此“工作第一，学习第二”。他们干工作很热情，而学习却很糟糕。
    上述这些思想，阻碍了很多同学的进步。自从抗美援朝运动开展以后，经过爱国主义的思想教育，这种情形有了改变。特别是今年四、五月起推行爱国公约运动以来，一部分学校出现了新面貌。
    到九月份为止，南京各中等以上学校，百分之七十已经订立了全校性的爱国公约，绝大部分并以系、级、班为单位订立了爱国公约，许多同学还订立了个人计划。一部分单位，如南京大学附属中学、华东药专、市立第一中学、南京大学化工系、政治系等，订立和执行爱国公约都比较好，爱国公约对于推动学习起了显著的作用。这些单位在订立和检查爱国公约的过程中，进行了充分的酝酿和讨论。首先使大家明确认识了个人与祖国的关系，批判了各种不正确的学习态度，认识到学习是祖国交给学生的光荣任务，好好学习就是爱国主义的实践，因而大大提高了学习情绪。他们研究了每个班、每个人在学习上的主要缺点，提出改进办法，订到爱国公约和个人计划里。例如华东药专高职科一年级，自订立爱国公约以后，纠正了班上的自由散漫现象；功课好的同学诚恳地帮助功课较差的同学；某些同学有疑难问别人时也不再被认为是“丢脸”的事了。这样，就显著地提高了全班的学习成绩。南京大学政治系在订立爱国公约以前，许多同学不愿学政治，因而不安心学习，想转系。在订立爱国公约的过程中，大家把学习政治与国家的需要联系起来进行了讨论，认识到了学习政治的重要。他们一方面积极向教授提意见改进教学；一方面组织各种研究小组加强课外的学习活动，目前一般都能安心学习了。许多同学在订立爱国公约和个人计划之后，加强了学习的计划性，克服了过去的忙乱现象。南京大学附属中学学生会学习部长朱家珍，订立爱国公约后很好地安排了自己学习和工作的时间，上学期的期考成绩达到了九十一分多（过去总是八十几分）。
    自从订立爱国公约以后，不少单位的抗美援朝爱国主义教育经常化起来了。他们在爱国公约中规定了时事学习的制度，有的还成立了读报研究小组，克服了“不问国事”的倾向。华东药专高一班，在爱国公约中提出每人每月给志愿军写一封慰问信。他们在写信时都结合检查这一个月来自己的学习、工作和思想情况，报告给志愿军。这样，每写一封信，就使自己受到了一次很好的爱国主义教育。
    爱国公约也推动了同学们经常参加体育和文化娱乐活动，因而增进了同学们的健康。南京大学附属中学，过去很多人不参加体育、娱乐活动，学生会文娱、体育部的负责同学为之大伤脑筋。自从在爱国公约中订上“加强体格锻炼，注意卫生，搞好娱乐体育活动”以后，每到体育活动和文化、娱乐活动的时间，全校同学百分之百地去参加。该校的同学汤啸，过去因为不善参加体育活动，怕搞不好被人笑话，因此每次都借故不参加。订立爱国公约以后，他鼓起勇气和同学们一道参加活动，现在已经学会了几项体育活动的本领，身体也比以前健康了。
    师生之间、同学之间的团结互助，也随着爱国公约的订立而有改进。爱国公约也丰富了学校青年团和学生会的工作内容。事实证明，和对其他各界人民一样，爱国公约也是广大学生、教师进行自我教育的良好形式。但许多学校的领导方面目前还没有充分认识这一工作的重要意义，因而没有很好地领导这一工作。许多单位的爱国公约还没有发挥应有的作用，这是今后必须努力改进的。（摘自青年团南京市工作委员会学生部的来稿）
