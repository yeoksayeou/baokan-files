　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 11th: At the subcommittee meeting of the Korean armistice negotiations on the 11th, our representative continued to refute the proposal put forward by the other side on November 10th. In this proposal, although the other side had to admit the correctness of the principle of on-the-spot ceasefire proposed by our side, it opposed the specific determination of the military demarcation line and demilitarized zone based on this correct principle, attempting to overturn the clear provisions of the agenda. Our representative pointed out: When the other side put forward the absurd and arrogant military demarcation line proposal in July, which would have penetrated deep into our positions, and when the other side put forward the so-called adjustment plan to occupy our Kaesong area on October 25th, the other side never opposed specifically stipulating the military demarcation line and demilitarized zone. However, after our side put forward a fair and reasonable on-the-spot ceasefire plan, the other side began to firmly oppose the specific determination of the military demarcation line and demilitarized zone. This is enough to prove that the other side is only willing to abide by the agenda's provisions to determine the military demarcation line and demilitarized zone when it is unilaterally advantageous, and when the other side cannot obtain unilaterally advantageous demands through deception, it does not hesitate to tear up the agenda that both parties have already agreed upon. Our representative pointed out that if, during the armistice negotiations, the other side can arbitrarily overturn the already agreed-upon agenda, then there is no way to guarantee the observance of the agreements determined afterward. We firmly oppose the other side's proposal of November 10th and believe that the military demarcation line and demilitarized zone must be specifically determined in strict accordance with the provisions of the second item of the agenda and revised according to changes in the line of contact before the signing of the armistice agreement. Our proposal and method put forward on November 10th is the only reasonable solution to quickly resolve the second item of the agenda.

　　我方代表继续驳斥美方无理建议
    坚持公平合理的就地停战方案
    【新华社开城十一日电】十一日的朝鲜停战谈判小组委员会上，我方代表继续驳斥对方在十一月十日所提出的建议。对方在这一建议中，虽然不得不承认我方提出的就地停战原则的正确性，但却反对根据这一正确原则即行具体确定军事分界线与非军事区，企图推翻议程中的明确规定。我方代表指出：当对方在七月提出深入我方阵地的荒谬狂妄的军事分界线方案时，以及当对方在十月二十五日提出占领我方开城地区的所谓调整方案时，对方从未反对具体规定军事分界线与非军事区，但当我方提出了公平合理的就地停战方案以后，对方即开始坚决反对具体确定军事分界线与非军事区，这正足以证明对方只是在片面有利的情况下才愿意遵守议程的规定确定军事分界线与非军事区，而当对方无从诈取片面有利的要求时，就不惜撕毁双方已经协议的议程。我方代表指出：如果在停战谈判过程中，对方可以任意推翻已经协议的议程，则更无从保证确定后协议之遵守。我们坚决反对对方十一月十日的建议，认为军事分界线及非军事区必须严格按照第二项议程的规定即行具体确定，而在停战协议签字前按照接触线的变化予以修正。我方十一月十日提出的建议及办法是迅速解决第二项议程唯一合理的方案。
