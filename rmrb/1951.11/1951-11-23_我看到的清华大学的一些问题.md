Some Problems I See at Tsinghua University
Zhang Wei, Professor of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University

Tsinghua University was founded by American imperialism using the blood and sweat of the Chinese people (Boxer Indemnity), with the aim of creating a group of lackeys to serve it. The intention was extremely malicious. Initially, it was a preparatory school for studying in the United States. Although it was later transformed into a university, its essence never changed. Many teachers went through the preparatory program and then studied in the United States before returning to Tsinghua University to work as professors. The students were the same. Before the "July 7th" Incident, teachers taught entirely in English (then generally referred to as "original text"); conversations were always mixed with English. Students also took pride in being able to understand English. Until recently, most of the textbooks we used were still in English. For example, although Chinese industry has adopted the metric system, and the government has clearly stipulated that the metric system should be the standard for Chinese weights and measures, many teachers in our engineering college, citing the excuse of not being able to find materials on the metric system, continue to use the English system.

Tsinghua University has cultivated some talent in the past. Many professors have therefore become arrogant, believing that everyone else is inferior to them, that every other department is inferior to their own, and that every other university is inferior to Tsinghua University. But who do our students serve after leaving school? The vast majority of students work for the Kuomintang reactionaries after graduation. The particularly "outstanding" ones go abroad to study one after another, and those who are appreciated by the Americans stay in the United States as professors. What are some of the students who have made contributions in fluid mechanics doing in the United States? They are not solving theoretical problems in aircraft design for the Chinese people, but are studying supersonic aircraft for American imperialism, allowing American air pirates to bomb the peaceful residents of Korea and our volunteers. For these Chinese "scientists" who serve American imperialism, we (including myself, Mr. Qian Weichang, and other teachers) not only do not publicly criticize them in school, but sometimes in lectures or conversations, we even portray their achievements as the achievements of the Chinese people in mechanics. This shows that our national consciousness is very vague.

Considering problems from the perspective of personal interests is the most common mistake for intellectuals. This is no exception among the current colleagues at Tsinghua University. A professor in the metal testing laboratory of the mechanical engineering department, fearing that imparting knowledge to teaching assistants would affect his own position in the past, actually put away new reference books and did not let the teaching assistants see them; he was also unwilling to let the teaching assistants use the testing equipment. As a result, two teaching assistants resigned one after another; another teaching assistant also developed a prejudice against him, and they did not speak to each other when they met. Not only that, he also adopted an uncooperative attitude with professors teaching similar courses. If this phenomenon continues, it will be impossible for us to complete the tasks assigned to us by the people.

There is a phenomenon of each college and department acting on its own. Tsinghua University used American imperialism's "dollars" – the blood and sweat of the Chinese people – to build many buildings in the past. Almost every department in the engineering college has a building, called something like a hall. In each hall, the department head has the right to control everything, and he believes that other departments cannot "invade" his territory. Therefore, the newly established mining department does not have enough housing and has to temporarily place the models sent by the Ministry of Fuel Industry in the garage. Is it absolutely impossible to solve the housing problem for the mining department? The fact is not so. Some departments would rather give the building to their own students for rest and gatherings than temporarily "lend" it to the mining department.

Our school has quite a few metalworking equipment, most of which are in the metalworking factory, and a small part is scattered in various departments. In addition to being used for student internships, the equipment in the metalworking factory also provides repair and maintenance work for on and off campus. In order to expand the equipment, the leading comrades of the metalworking factory developed a purely profit-oriented view, charging very high fees, which aroused dissatisfaction among the working comrades in various departments with the factory. The lathes in various departments have not been well utilized. I think the best way to solve this problem is to use these equipments in a planned way under unified leadership to serve the whole school's internship and repair work. However, because the leading comrades of various units and the metalworking factory only see the interests of their own units, this problem has not been well resolved.

At the beginning of this year, under the leadership of the Academic Affairs Office, Tsinghua University drafted a school-wide plan for the adjustment of colleges and departments, expanding the original four colleges and twenty-one departments to fourteen colleges and forty-two departments. Although many meetings were held and everyone debated for a long time, the problem was not resolved because the leading comrades of all parties did not consider the problem from the needs of the country. What everyone kept in mind was: whether their department would be expanded into a college, whether there would be a "portion" to be transferred out, etc. Two departments, which could have been merged into one college in terms of their nature, were instead both "merged" into colleges because they feared that one of the department heads would be unwilling to be subordinate to the other.

The administrative leadership of Tsinghua University does not pay enough attention to ideological leadership. The school committee or the school affairs working meeting rarely proactively plans and arranges work based on the cultural and educational policies of the People's Government. Take this teacher's study as an example. For more than a month, the work of the sub-study committees has been very intense, but the administrative leaders of the school have rarely participated in the actual leadership work themselves. The school and trade union leaders are probably not very clear about the ideological situation of the teachers, what problems currently exist, and how to proceed next. Leading comrades must take the lead in learning and conduct in-depth examinations of their own thoughts and work; otherwise, future work will be difficult to do well.

    我看到的清华大学的一些问题
    清华大学机械系教授  张　维
    清华大学是由美帝国主义用中国人民的血汗（庚子赔款）创办起来的，目的是要制造一批为它服务的洋奴。其用意十分毒恶。最初办留美预备班。后来虽改为大学，但其实质始终没有改变。很多先生经留美预备班再到美国留学，然后回清华大学，担任教授的工作。学生也是如此。在“七七”抗战前，教师们全用英文（那时一般的称之为“原文”）讲课；谈话时总是夹杂着英语。学生也以能听懂英文为荣。一直到最近，我们所用的课本大部分还是英文的。又如中国工业上采用公制，政府也明白规定以公制为中国的度量衡标准；但是我们工学院的不少先生借口找不到关于公制的资料，而继续使用英制。
    清华大学在过去曾培养出一些人材。很多教授因而自高自大起来，认为别人全不如他，别的系全不如他那一系，别的学校全不如清华大学。但是我们的学生离校后究竟给什么人服务呢？绝大多数学生离校后是为国民党反动派工作的。其中特别“优秀”的则先后出洋留学，得到美国人赏识的就留在美国作教授。像在流体力学方面有贡献的几位同学，他们在美国干什么呢？他们不是在为中国人民解决飞机设计的理论问题，而是在为美帝国主义研究超音速飞机，让美国的空中强盗去轰炸朝鲜的和平居民和我们的志愿军。对于这些为美帝国主义服务的中国“科学家”们，我们（其中包括我自己、钱伟长先生及其他的先生）在学校里不但不加以公开批评，而且有时在讲课或谈话中还把他们的成就说成是中国人民在力学方面的成就。这说明了我们的民族意识是很模糊的。
    从个人利益出发去考虑问题是知识分子最容易犯的毛病。这在目前的清华大学同人中也不能例外。机械系金属试验室的一位教授在过去由于害怕把学问传授给助教以后会影响自己的地位，竟将新的参考书收起来，不给助教看；试验设备也不愿让助教使用。结果气得两位助教先后辞职他去；另一位助教也对他有了成见，见面时彼此不说话。不但如此，他与其他教类似课程的教授也采取不合作的态度。如果让这种现象继续下去，我们是不可能完成人民所交给我们的任务的。
    在院与院、系与系之间，存在着各自为政的现象。清华大学过去用美帝国主义的“美元”——中国人民的血汗盖了很多房子。几乎理工学院的每个系都有一所楼，叫做什么馆。在每一个馆里，系主任有着支配一切的权利，他认为别的系不能“侵入”他的范围内，因此，新成立的采矿系没有足够的房子，只好把燃料工业部送来的模型暂时放在汽车房内。采矿系的房子问题是绝对不可能解决的吗？事实并不是如此，有的系宁可将房子给本系的学生作休息聚会用，却不愿暂时“借”给采矿系用。
    我们学校里的金工设备不算太少，大部分在金工厂，小部分散在各系。金工厂的设备除了给学生作实习之用外，还为校内外作修配工作。为了扩充设备，金工厂领导同志产生了单纯的营利观点，收费很高，引起各系工作同志对工厂的不满。对于各系的车床则没有很好地加以利用。我认为，解决这个问题的最好的办法，是在统一领导下，将这些设备有计划地加以使用，为全校的实习及修配工作服务。但是因为各单位及金工厂的领导同志只看到本单位的利益，这个问题始终没有很好地解决。
    今年年初清华大学在教务处的领导下拟出了一个全校的院系调整方案，将原有的四院二十一系扩充到十四院四十二系。虽然开了多少次会，大家争辩了许久，但由于各方面的领导同志没有从国家的需要出发去考虑问题，这个问题终于没有解决。大家念念不忘的是：自己这一系是不是扩充为院，有无调出的“部分”等等。有两个系从性质上说本可以合并成一个院，但是怕其中的一位系主任不愿意居他人之下，结果两系全“并”为院。
    清华大学行政领导方面对思想领导是不够重视的。校委会或校务工作会议很少主动地根据人民政府的文教政策去计划及布置工作。就以这次教师学习来说吧，一个多月以来，分学委会的工作是十分紧张的，但是学校行政负责同志却很少亲自参加实际的领导工作。关于教师们的思想情况，目前存在着那些问题，下一步应当如何去作，学校和工会的负责同志恐怕都是不大清楚的。领导同志必须在学习中起带头作用，对自己的思想和工作进行深入的检查，否则将来的工作还是难于做好的。
