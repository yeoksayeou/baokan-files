A Brief Review of Political and Legal Work

　　Must Examine Attitudes Towards Women from the Depths of Our Thoughts

    The Secretary of the Cangshan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shandong Province, along with the Deputy County Heads, have reviewed their handling of the Pan Shi murder case, recognizing their errors in bureaucratic work style and ineffective implementation of the Marriage Law. They have formulated plans to improve their work, particularly through vigorous promotion of the Marriage Law using this case as a typical example. These are all good steps.

    However, these reviews are still not thorough enough. This is mainly reflected in the failure to address the attitude towards women, which is the root cause of the ineffective implementation of the Marriage Law and the most fundamental issue.

    In the old society, women were in a position of slavery, and abuse and beatings were considered the rights of husbands and mothers-in-law, with no interference from others. Even killing or forcing women to death was often overlooked by the law. At that time, people had a fundamental view of women: "A wife is like a horse you buy," equating women with horses. Although few people openly say this today, this view still lingers in the minds of people, including some cadres. This is evident in the handling of cases of abused women and marriage problems in Cangshan County and its First District. Village cadres not only fail to intervene and stop the beating of women, but even establish their own "private courts" to "hang and beat" women seeking divorce. To what extent does this show contempt for the laws of the people's country! Why could the county court "let them off lightly," "only offering criticism" and "ordering them to return to the village for reflection"? Here, every comrade in Cangshan County can examine whether they are treating women with complete equality and democracy. The fact that Cangshan County has handled many cases of oppressed and persecuted women in a perfunctory and unserious manner, resulting in "more than fifty deaths of women due to lack of freedom in marriage in the past year," should attract the profound attention and self-criticism of the responsible comrades of the county. They should not stop at general reviews such as "bureaucratic work style" and "insufficient study."

    Only by establishing a correct view and attitude towards women, and deeply understanding why this attitude should be adopted, can we be effective in educating the masses. Only then can we consciously adhere to correct principles when handling cases in the future, truly implement the Marriage Law, and prevent such heartbreaking incidents from happening again. We hope that comrades in Cangshan County and other regions can conduct a thorough examination and discussion of their fundamental attitude towards women and publish their findings.

    政法工作简评
　　必须从思想深处检查对待妇女的态度
    中共山东省苍山县委书记及正副县长等对潘氏被杀事件做了检讨，认识了官僚主义作风与对婚姻法执行不力的错误，订出了改进工作的计划，特别是通过这一典型案件，大张旗鼓地宣传婚姻法，这些都是好的。
    但是，这些检讨还是不深刻的。这主要表现在没有接触到对待妇女的态度问题、看法问题，而这却正是对婚姻法执行不力的根源，是最根本的问题。
    在旧社会里，妇女处于奴隶地位，虐待和打骂妇女被认为是丈夫和婆婆的权利，别人不能干涉。甚至杀死或逼死妇女，法律也是不大过问的。那时候人们对妇女有一种根本看法，那就是“娶到的媳妇买到的马”，妇女等于马。今天虽然不大有人公开这样说了，但这种看法却残存在人们以至若干干部的脑子里。这从苍山县和该县一区对若干妇女受虐待的问题和婚姻问题的处理中看得很明显。村干部不仅对打骂妇女的现象不加干涉、制止，甚至自己“私立法庭”“吊打”要求离婚的妇女，这对人民国家的法律蔑视到了什么程度！为什么县法院可以“轻轻放过”，“只予批评”，“令其回村反省了事”？这里，苍山县的每个同志都可以检查一下自己是不是以完全平等、民主的态度看待妇女。苍山县对许多妇女受压迫、受迫害的事件，处理得不认真，不严肃，以致一年来发生“妇女因婚姻不能自由而致死的事件有五十余起之多”，应该引起该县负责同志们深刻注意，深刻检讨，不要停止在“官僚主义作风”，“学习不够”等一般的检讨上。
    只有自己树立了对待妇女的正确看法与态度，深刻地认识了为什么应该采取这种态度，在教育群众时才能有力量；在今后处理事件时才能自觉地坚持正确的原则，使婚姻法真正贯彻执行下去，使痛心的事件再不发生。我们希望苍山县以至其他地区的同志们，都能在对待妇女的根本态度上进行彻底的检查，讨论，并公开发表。
