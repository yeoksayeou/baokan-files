Three Thousand People in Deshengmen Guanxiang, Beijing, Gather to Accuse Mule and Horse Industry Overlords; Military Control Commission Military Law Office to Punish According to Their Crimes

More than three thousand people in Deshengmen Guanxiang, Beijing, held a rally at the Shuijiaokou Square outside Deshengmen on the 5th to accuse six feudal overlords in the mule and horse industry, Wei Yongshun, Xu Changhai, Ma Xiangpu, Wang Chunyi, Wang Guoxiang, and Liu Chunfu, of their heinous crimes. At the meeting, representatives of the Military Law Office of the Beijing Military Control Commission stated that the Military Law Office would severely punish these feudal overlords according to their crimes in accordance with the law. The Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce also announced the abolition of the feudal monopoly system in the mule and horse industry and the establishment of a new mule and horse trading market.

Participants in the accusation rally included mule and horse industry merchants, citizens of Deshengmen Guanxiang, and farmer representatives from villages in the northern suburbs. Victims of the overlords pointed to these overlords and angrily accused them of colluding with Japanese invaders, Kuomintang bandit troops, and secret agents to kill people and manipulate mule and horse trading.

The overlord Wei Yongshun was a Central Statistics Bureau (Zhongtong) secret agent, served as a puppet Bao head, and was one of the "Five Tigers of the Wei Family." Li Xiang accused Wei Yongshun of leading the puppet self-defense force to arrest five patriotic students from Tsinghua University before liberation, and of being commended by the Kuomintang reactionaries. Wei Yongshun also conscripted soldiers for the Kuomintang bandit army and extorted money. Ma Ziyi accused: "Wei Yongshun forced me to have nowhere to hide, not daring to go home, and he also extorted a lot of money from me." The overlord Ma Xiangpu collected information about the Eighth Route Army for the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandits, and forced the masses to give money to the Japanese invaders and traitors to present flags and plaques. He also bought and sold guns, trafficked in opium, and raped many women. Ma Xiangpu's first wife accused: "After I married Ma Xiangpu, I was hungry and suffered abuse all day long, and was beaten badly all over." She took off her top on the spot to show everyone her scars. She continued: "Once, I was so hungry that I had no choice but to steal horse feed, and my mouth was swollen and festering. When the overlord Ma Xiangpu saw it, he slapped out one of my teeth, and my mouth was bleeding. In the end, I was driven out of the house and wandered for twenty years." After pouring out her bitterness, she shouted: "Chairman Mao is like the sun. Under the shining sun, we will always be in the light!" Ma Xiangpu's second wife also came to accuse him. She tearfully recounted the suffering of being abused for seven years. Both wives had miscarriages under Ma Xiangpu's beatings, and one two-year-old child was frightened to death. Both of them unanimously demanded blood for blood. At this time, the crowd under the stage kept shouting: "Severely punish the feudal overlords!" The overlord Xu Changhai, who called himself "Emperor Xu the Third," nicknamed "Northern Overlord," beat and scolded the masses, and committed all kinds of evil. Liu Wenqing pointed to Xu Changhai and accused: "I was beaten by him so badly that I still don't dare to pass by his door after liberation." Wang Ming accused him of buying mules without paying, forcing a horse trader from Yanqing County, Chahar Province, to death. Ma Xun accused the overlord Wang Chunyi of controlling mule and horse trading, using "needle pricking and drug灌药" methods to cover up mule and horse injuries, deceive farmers, hinder production, and undermine urban-rural trade. When the People's Government organized a mule and horse trading market last year, Wang Chunyi threatened to overturn the trading market. He still spoke in code in the market, not allowing the buying and selling parties to meet, taking advantage of the situation, and undermining the People's Government's reform of the trading market.

At the meeting, representatives of the Military Law Office of the Beijing Military Control Commission announced: The Military Law Office accepts everyone's request and, based on the accusations of the masses, will definitely punish these feudal overlords according to the law. Ma Yuhuai, Deputy Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, said: The government will severely punish the overlords and "loubao" who have committed heinous crimes. Representatives of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce said: We must completely destroy the feudal monopoly system in the mule and horse industry. Now the Bureau of Industry and Commerce has formulated temporary regulations for the management of the mule and horse trading market and established a new trading market. All mule and horse shops in the city must operate according to the new system. Wang Jingming, Chairman of the People's Representative Conference of the Fourteenth District, and Guo Peiran, District Chief of the Fourteenth District, also spoke at the meeting, explaining in detail the government's policy of reforming the mule and horse trading system, and unanimously supported the people's just demand to severely punish the feudal overlords.

After the accusation rally, the presidium continued to receive many written accusations from the masses. (Wang Duanji)

    北京市德胜门关厢
    三千群众集会控诉骡马业恶霸
    军事管制委员会军法处将按其罪行予以严惩
    北京市德胜门关厢群众三千多人，五日在德胜门外水窖口广场举行大会，控诉骡马业罪大恶极的六名封建恶霸魏永顺、徐长海、马祥普、王春义、王国祥、刘春甫的罪行。会上，北京市军事管制委员会军法处代表表示：军法处对这些封建恶霸将根据他们的罪行依法严惩。市工商局同时宣布废除骡马业中的封建把持制度，成立新的骡马交易市场。
    参加控诉大会的有骡马业商人、德胜门关厢市民和北郊各村农民代表。被残害过的苦主，指着这些恶霸愤怒控诉他们勾结日寇、国民党匪军、特务，杀害人民，操纵骡马交易的罪行。
    恶霸魏永顺是中统特务，做过伪保长，是“魏家五虎”之一。李祥控诉魏永顺解放前曾经带领伪自卫队逮捕清华大学五名爱国学生，并受到国民党反动派的表扬。魏永顺还给国民党匪军抓兵，勒索钱财。麻自义控诉说：“魏永顺逼得我无处藏躲，不敢回家，他还敲诈我很多钱。”恶霸马祥普给日寇、国民党匪帮搜集八路军的情报，强迫群众拿钱给日寇、汉奸送旗挂匾。他还买卖枪枝，贩运烟毒，强奸过很多妇女。马祥普第一个妻子控诉说：“我跟马祥普结婚后，整天挨饿受气，遭受毒打，混身都是伤。”她当场脱掉上衣给大家看伤疤。她接着说：“有一次，我饿得没办法，偷吃马料后，嘴巴烂肿，被恶霸马祥普看见，一巴掌打掉了我一个槽牙，满嘴流血。最后还被撵出门外，流浪了二十年。”她吐出苦水后高呼：“毛主席像太阳，在太阳照着下，我们永远是光明的。”马祥普的第二个妻子也到场控诉。她流着眼泪诉说受了七年虐待的苦楚。两个妻子在马祥普的毒打下，都曾小产过，还吓死过一个两岁的幼儿。她们两个一致要求血债血还。这时，台下群众不断高呼：“严惩封建恶霸！”恶霸徐长海，自称“徐三皇上”，绰号“北霸天”，打骂群众，无恶不作。刘文庆指着徐长海控诉说：“我被他打得解放后还都不敢从他门口过。”王明控诉他买骡子不给钱，把察哈尔省延庆县一个马贩子活活逼死。马勋控诉恶霸王春义把持骡马交易，用“扎针灌药”办法，掩饰骡马病伤，欺骗农民，妨害生产，破坏城乡贸易。人民政府去年组织骡马交易市场，王春义扬言要踢翻交易市场，他在市场上照旧说黑话，不叫买卖双方见面，从中取利，破坏人民政府对交易市场的改革。
    会上，北京市军事管制委员会军法处代表宣布：军法处接受大家要求，并根据群众控诉，一定依法惩办这些封建恶霸。民政局副局长马玉槐说：政府对罪大恶极的恶霸、搂包，一定严厉惩办。工商局代表说：我们一定要彻底摧毁骡马业中的封建把持制度，现在工商局制定了骡马交易市场管理暂行规则，成立了新的交易市场，全市骡马店必须按着新制度办事。第十四区各界人民代表会议主席王景明、第十四区区长郭裴然也在会上讲了话，详细说明政府改革骡马交易制度的政策后，并一致支持人民严惩封建恶霸的正义要求。
    控诉大会结束后，主席台上还陆续收到群众控诉书多件。（王段吉）
