    Central People's Government Ministry of Heavy Industry's Managerial Department
    Sells Good Iron Pipes as Scrap Iron to Private Merchants
    Readers of This Newspaper Suggest Relevant Authorities Conduct Prompt Inspection and Handling
    The Central People's Government Ministry of Heavy Industry is selling over 800 tons of one-meter and 800-centimeter large iron pipes stored at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant to private merchants as scrap iron, at a price of 1.8 million yuan per ton. After selling these iron pipes to private merchants, the ministry is using the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant's machinery to smash the iron pipes into scrap iron for the merchants to load and transport. This smashing has been going on for nine days, and it is estimated that one-tenth has already been smashed. According to Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant technician Lu Shiren, although these iron pipes are not currently needed, they will be of great use in two years' time. At that time, it would probably be impossible to buy a ton for 4.4 million yuan. Li Lianzhi, the material management clerk at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, said: This is a decision of the higher authorities, for the sake of capital turnover. The workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant are very distressed and surprised to see this situation. Some workers said: We are always talking about increasing production and saving raw materials, how can we smash finished products into scrap iron and sell them off? Labor model Ma Yinhe said: Although these iron pipes are not currently needed, if the current equipment breaks down, there is nowhere to buy replacements. There is no factory in North China that manufactures such large iron pipes, it is a pity to sell them. Worker Hu Zengtian said: I get so angry when I see them smashing the iron pipes. How much are these big iron pipes worth! The workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant all say that selling good iron pipes as scrap iron is clearly a waste of the people's property. We hope that the leading authorities will consider this carefully, study it thoroughly, come up with a proper solution, and quickly stop this phenomenon, so as to avoid more losses to the people's property.

    中央人民政府重工业部经理司
    把好铁管当作废铁卖给私商
    本报读者建议有关机关迅速检查处理
    中央人民政府重工业部，把存在石景山钢铁厂的八百多吨一米和八百糎的大铁管，当作废铁卖给私商；每吨卖价一百八十万元。该部把这些铁管卖给私商之后，并用石景山钢铁厂的机器，替私商把铁管砸成碎铁，装车运走。这些铁管已经砸了九天，估计已砸了十分之一。据石景山钢铁厂技术人员鲁世仁谈：这些铁管现在虽然用不着，但如放到两年以后，就有很大用处。那时候用四百四十万元买一吨，恐怕也买不回来。石景山钢铁厂管材料的职员李连枝说：这是上级机关的决定，是为了资金的周转。石景山钢铁厂的工人们看见了这种情况，非常痛惜和奇怪。有的工人说：整天说要提高生产，节约原材料，怎么能把成品砸成废铁卖出去呢？劳动模范马印和说：虽然这些铁管目前用不着，但是现在的设备万一坏了，买都没有地方买去。在华北没有制造这样大铁管的工厂，把这些铁管卖出去，太可惜了。工人胡增田说：我看见砸铁管，把眼都气蓝了。像这样的大铁管，要值多少钱呀！石景山钢铁厂的工人们都说，把好铁管当废铁卖，显然是浪费了人民的财产。我们希望领导机关慎重考虑，仔细研究，想一妥善办法，赶快制止这种现象，以免使更多的人民财产遭受损失。（薛鹏起）
