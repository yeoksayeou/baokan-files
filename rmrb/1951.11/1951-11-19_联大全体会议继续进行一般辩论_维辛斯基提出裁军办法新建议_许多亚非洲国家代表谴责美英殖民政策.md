Xinhua News Agency, Eighteenth Dispatch from Paris: The United Nations General Assembly plenary sessions on November 14th, 15th, and 16th continued the general debate.

Representatives of many Asian and African countries spoke at the meeting. They demanded that the major powers peacefully resolve international disputes and criticized the imperialist colonial policies. Their speeches more or less reflected the people's desire for peace and the rising tide of the colonial and semi-colonial peoples' movement against imperialist enslavement and for national liberation.

Indian representative Rau stressed the necessity for the major powers to reach complete agreement on the most important issues related to maintaining universal peace. He reiterated his proposal from last year that the foreign ministers of the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France hold direct negotiations during the General Assembly meeting in order to issue a joint declaration that they would never resort to war. Rau, talking about the work of the United Nations, emphasized that one of the most serious shortcomings of the UN's activities was the absence of a legitimate Chinese representative. He said: It is enough to cite just one example: We will soon be discussing plans for the reduction of armaments and armed forces, but the government that possesses the most important army in the world, namely the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, has no representative present.

The Iranian representative, in talking about the causes of the existing international tensions, pointed out: Certain major powers do not always respect the political and economic independence of other countries, but violate the principles of the United Nations Charter and interfere in their internal affairs.

Pakistani representative Zafrulla Khan condemned the imperialist and colonialist system of rule, the exploitation of small countries, and the attempts by certain races to conquer other races. He emphasized that imperialism and colonial rule were part of the main obstacle to maintaining world peace. The peoples of Asia and Africa abhor the colonial countries' conspiracy to prevent them from gaining full independence. The Indonesian representative expressed regret over the world's division into two major camps, and he demanded the speedy resolution of issues that threaten peace and the security of nations, and that major powers coexist peacefully. The Burmese representative lamented the inability of the major powers to reach an agreement. He believed that this situation was fraught with the danger of a new war. He pointed out that one of the reasons for discord among the major powers was that some of them were striving to achieve hegemony. These countries maintain systems of racial prejudice and racial discrimination that should have been eliminated worldwide long ago.

Egyptian representative Salahuddin said: Dangerous situations have been caused in the Near East because the colonial countries, in their relations with the countries of the Near East, still want to use those illegal and shameless means that they used when they established their rule in the region by force in the last century. He said: Britain claims to be an ally of Egypt, but is carrying out predatory and devastating aggression against the Egyptian people, completely violating the principles of the United Nations Charter. He said: The United Nations Charter stipulates the right of all countries to independence, and Egypt is determined to fight to the end for its right to independence. Salahuddin also condemned the Near East Pact plan, which is being promoted by the US-British bloc, as an imperialist plan.

The Syrian representative said that discord among the major powers has caused anxiety among the small countries, and he urged the representatives of the major powers to meet and seek peaceful solutions to various problems. He denounced the U.S.'s Near East Pact plan, saying that this pact was imposed on the Near East countries by the United States, Britain, and France, while the three countries themselves are not Near East countries.

The Liberian representative spoke about the need to give the people of Africa the right to self-government, and the need to end the system that keeps the people of Africa in a state of ignorance and treats them merely as a source of cheap labor.

During the three days of meetings, representatives of many countries of the U.S.-British majority bloc also spoke. They repeated words like "peace" and "freedom," but at the same time greatly praised the American war policy that contributed to the international tension.

Ukrainian representative Baranov, Belarusian representative Kiselev, and Czechoslovak representative Sekaninova successively spoke at the meeting. They exposed the deceptive nature of the disarmament proposals of the United States, Britain, and France, and enthusiastically supported the Soviet delegation's proposal on "measures to eliminate the threat of another world war and consolidate international peace and friendship."

At the afternoon meeting on the 16th, Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation, delivered a second lengthy speech in the general debate, refuting the hypocritical declarations of the United States, Britain, and France regarding disarmament and proposing new Soviet suggestions that specifically stipulated the methods for reducing armaments. Finally, Lai Yi spoke, very vaguely suggesting that the foreign ministers and other leaders of countries where differences exist should hold direct negotiations in Paris during the Sixth General Assembly.

The General Assembly's general debate concluded here.

　　联大全体会议继续进行一般辩论
    维辛斯基提出裁军办法新建议
    许多亚非洲国家代表谴责美英殖民政策
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社巴黎消息：联合国大会十一月十四、十五、十六日全体会议继续进行一般辩论。
    许多亚洲和非洲国家的代表在会上发了言。他们要求大国和平解决国际争执，并抨击帝国主义的殖民政策。他们的发言或多或少地反映出人民的和平愿望和殖民地与半殖民地人民反对帝国主义奴役制度、争取民族解放的运动的高涨。
    印度代表劳氏着重指出大国就有关保持普遍和平的最重要问题获致完全协议的必要。他再度提出他去年提出的提案由美苏英法四国外长在大会开会时直接进行谈判，以便发表它们决不诉诸战争的联合宣言。劳氏谈到联合国的工作，强调联合国活动的最严重缺点之一，是没有合法的中国代表出席。他说：只要举这样一个例子就够了：我们不久就要讨论裁减军备和军队的计划，可是握有世界上最重要的军队的政府，即中华人民共和国中央人民政府，却没有代表出席。
    伊朗代表在谈到现存的国际紧张局势的原因时指出：某些大国并不永远尊重其他国家的政治和经济的独立，却违反着联合国宪章，干涉它们的内政。
    巴基斯坦代表查弗鲁拉·汗抨击帝国主义和殖民主义统治制度、剥削小国以及某些种族企图征服另外一些种族的行为。他强调指出：帝国主义和殖民主义统治是维持世界和平的主要障碍的一部分。亚洲和非洲人民痛恨殖民国家阻止他们获得完全独立的阴谋。印尼代表对世界分裂为两大阵营表示遗憾，他要求赶快解决威胁和平与各国安全的问题，大国和平相处。缅甸代表惋惜各大国不能够求得协议。他认为，这种局势充满着新战争的危险。他指出大国之间不和的原因之一是它们有些国家力谋取得霸权。这些国家维护早就该在全世界消灭的种族偏见与种族歧视的制度。
    埃及代表赛拉哈丁说：由于殖民国家在它们与近东国家的关系当中，仍然要像上一个世纪它们以武力在该地区建立统治的时候一样，使用那种非法和无耻的手段，因此而在近东地区引起了危险局势。他说：英国自称它是埃及的盟友，却在对埃及人民进行掠夺性的和蹂躏性的侵略，完全违反联合国宪章的原则。他说：联合国宪章规定了各国有独立的权利，埃及决心为它自己的独立权利奋斗到底。赛拉哈丁还谴责美英集团正在推行中的近东公约计划是帝国主义的计划。
    叙利亚代表说，大国间的不和造成了小国的不安，他力促各大国的代表开会谋求和平解决各种问题。他斥责美国的近东公约计划说，这个公约是美、英、法三国强加在近东各国的，而三国自己却并不是近东国家。
    利比里亚代表谈到必须给非洲的人民以自治的权利，必须结束那种使非洲人民处于愚昧无知的状态以及仅仅把他们当作廉价劳动力的来源的制度。
    在三天会议中，许多美英多数集团的国家的代表也发了言。他们重复“和平”与“自由”之类的字眼，但同时又对促成国际紧张局面的美国战争政策大加捧场。
    乌克兰代表巴拉诺夫斯基、白俄罗斯代表基塞列夫、捷克斯洛伐克代表塞卡尼诺娃先后在会上发言，他们揭露美英法三国所谓裁减军备的提案的欺骗性质，并热烈拥护苏联代表团所提出的“关于消除另一次世界大战的威胁和巩固国际和平与友好的措施”的提案。
    在十六日下午会议上，苏联代表团团长维辛斯基发表一般辩论中的第二次长篇演说，驳斥美英法三国关于裁军的虚伪宣言。并提出苏联的具体规定裁减军备办法的新建议。最后是赖伊的发言，他非常含糊地建议有分歧存在的各国的外长及其他领袖应在第六届大会期间在巴黎直接举行谈判。
    大会的一般辩论至此结束。
