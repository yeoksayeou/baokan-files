Xinhua News Agency, Paris, November 17th (TASS):

Mr. Chairman, esteemed delegates!

In the general debate of the General Assembly, which is now drawing to a close, many representatives have addressed all the extremely important issues. These issues are mainly related to the speeches and proposals of the delegations of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, as well as the speeches and proposals of the Soviet delegation. Although these proposals have received considerable attention, not all issues have been adequately explained, and it cannot be said that the discussion is over.

We have pointed out that the Three-Power proposal is being touted as a plan to reduce armies and armaments, including atomic weapons, and as being aimed at reducing the danger of war and strengthening the security of all countries, but in essence, the Three-Power proposal is completely different from this propaganda. It is not difficult to recognize this if one carefully analyzes the "Three-Power Declaration" containing these proposals. Naturally, I did not have the opportunity to make a sufficiently complete analysis of this declaration in my first speech. I only mentioned a few words in passing. I do not wish to conceal that I also told the General Assembly that the words in this declaration truly made me laugh.

The US, British, and French plan for controlling atomic energy is just a mockery of control

If we look at the extremely important issue of banning atomic weapons, we can see that the "Three-Power Declaration" does not stipulate the banning of atomic weapons at all, which is absolutely unacceptable. Therefore, it is by no means accidental that point 5 in the "Three-Power Declaration" is limited to saying that the so-called United Nations plan for controlling atomic energy and banning atomic weapons should still be the basis of the part of the overall plan for controlling, limiting, and proportionally reducing all armaments and armed forces that is related to atomic energy. This so-called plan for controlling atomic energy and banning atomic weapons, which the United States has imposed on most members of the United Nations in the past, although it speaks of international control of atomic energy and guaranteeing the banning of atomic weapons with the help of this control, actually neither stipulates the banning of atomic weapons nor stipulates international supervision of the implementation of this ban. Gentlemen, is there anyone who does not know this?

The United States Atomic Energy Commission, which was chaired by the current Secretary of State, Mr. Acheson – I am glad that Mr. Acheson is here – and assisted by an advisory board headed by Lilienthal – one of the drafters of the "Baruch Plan" – and including famous atomic weapon manufacturing experts such as Barnard, Oppenheimer, and Thomas, pointed out as early as 1946, when speaking of this so-called international control plan now mentioned in the "Three-Power Declaration," that this plan does not even require the United States to stop manufacturing atomic weapons after it comes into effect. Has this been forgotten? Is this a fact, or is it not a fact? I have not received any answer regarding this question.

The United States delegation – whose representatives, such as Mr. Austin, who are skilled in sophistry, are famous for always speaking and objecting to any issue – has not yet answered. This time, they may at least invoke Article 74 (referring to the rules of procedure) to answer. I am happy to give up my position here to them.

Perhaps they will answer what Secretary Acheson's memorandum to then Secretary of State Byrnes five years ago meant; that memorandum stated that even after the so-called international control plan is implemented, the United States is not necessarily stopping the manufacture of atomic weapons, and that everything will depend on the approval situation and political conditions and the international situation, and that the Senate cannot but take these into account when finally deciding on this issue together with the House of Representatives.

Therefore, the plan now mentioned in the "Three-Power Declaration" not only does not stipulate the banning of the manufacture of atomic weapons but also reserves the opportunity for the United States to continue manufacturing atomic weapons even after the international control plan is implemented.

As everyone knows, this is the characteristic of the "Baruch Plan." Another characteristic of this plan is that it stipulates the establishment of such an international atomic energy control organization, which will inevitably give unlimited power to the American monopoly capitalists who are gradually manipulating the entire world economy – including atomic energy resources; therefore, this plan is not an international control plan, but an American control plan, which has nothing in common with the tasks of a true international control organization, and in the words of the head of the Soviet government, J.V. Stalin, it is a mockery of control.

It is appropriate here to recall the following incident: this plan not only does not stipulate the banning of atomic weapons, but even stipulates – which is very strange – that the so-called international control organization, which is responsible for supervising the correct, sincere, and meticulous implementation of the decision to ban atomic weapons, this international control organization, which is established solely for this purpose, should have its own scientific research institution to study problems, and in the words of many American documents, is dedicated to researching the development of atomic weapons and the use of atomic weapons. It is truly a great absurdity to establish an international control organization responsible for supervising to ensure that no one dares to manufacture atomic weapons, and yet stipulate that this control organization should have a special research institute to further study the possibility of continuing to develop atomic weapons.

However, according to the "Three-Power Declaration," this plan will serve as the basis for the part of the overall plan to reduce armaments that concerns atomic weapons. The purpose of this plan is not to ban atomic weapons, but to legalize the manufacture and use of this barbaric weapon of mass slaughter of humanity. Needless to say, the Soviet Union could not agree in the past, and still cannot agree to such a plan now. However, what Mr. Acheson and Mr. Eden have presented here is precisely such a completely unsatisfactory plan that no one with common sense can accept. They boast that among their proposals, there is also a proposal to include atomic weapons and conventional armaments in the so-called "reporting and verification system," hoping to lure others with this. Mr. Eden called this progress on the issue of atomic weapons, saying that even if the three powers only put forward this proposal, their proposals would be worth studying by the General Assembly.

However, the issue is not about studying this or that proposal, but about the content of these proposals, their value, and about finding truly necessary and serious solutions to this major and serious issue.

However, the issue of atomic weapons cannot be seriously resolved if the unconditional banning of atomic weapons is not stipulated. The United States, Britain, and France stubbornly evade such a stipulation in the "Three-Power Declaration."

The Three-Power proposal to provide armaments information in stages is putting the cart before the horse

The three powers propose in their declaration to adopt a decision on the issue of providing armaments information, and they hope that this information will be submitted in stages, or as the declaration says, sequentially in stages.

Some people – including the previous speaker, General Romulo – are very enthusiastic about this declaration. But I am not as enthusiastic as he is. I know that he is a truly enthusiastic person, and it is not very difficult to make him enthusiastic: as long as the proposal is put forward by the United States, he praises it.

Regarding this proposal, Mr. Acheson said that this system of reporting and verification must be a phased development method that proceeds to another phase after one phase is completed. Acheson continued, starting by reporting the least important information, and then moving on to more critical aspects.

Mr. Eden also confirmed this in his speech on November 12. He said: "We propose that we should start with the less important types of troops and armaments, and then move on to those more important and secret types, and therefore more difficult to handle."

But the "more important and secret types" that Eden speaks of, or the more sensitive aspects that Acheson speaks of, are precisely those thorny issues that the three powers put in the final stage to handle in order to virtually completely evade providing information on atomic weapons. As everyone knows, atomic weapons belong to the most secret category, which, in Mr. Eden's words, are more difficult to handle. The true meaning of the phased approach invented by the three powers lies here, and its characteristics can be seen from the explanations of Mr. Acheson and Mr. Eden: the transition "from one stage to another" is to be arbitrarily decided by those who wield the power of so-called international control.

Mr. Acheson emphasized that in a world like ours, full of danger and suspicion, the people of all countries want to be assured, and that the reporting and verification system can provide this assurance. He also said that as we move from one stage to another, there will be more and more evidence of goodwill and sincerity. Mr. Acheson said that without this proof, there will be no progress. To talk about the issue in this way is nothing more than saying that, in terms of providing armaments information in accordance with the Three-Power plan, the transition from one stage to another must directly depend on whether the countries that possess more dangerous and powerful weapons believe that the results of the work of providing the information required in the first stage have been satisfactory. And the information about their own more dangerous and powerful weapons must be provided in a later stage. This is nothing more than saying that the fate of the entire plan for collecting armaments information, verifying this information, and implementing disarmament measures is in the hands of those countries that possess more powerful and dangerous weapons. Finally, it should also be said that to talk about the issue in this way indicates that the issue of transitioning from one stage to another will also be completely resolved by these countries, and therefore these countries will have ample opportunities not to allow one stage to suddenly transition to another stage if this transition proves to be contrary to their interests. It must be explained here that since atomic weapons or other weapons of mass slaughter of humanity are the most powerful and dangerous weapons, the countries that possess these weapons can unilaterally postpone providing information about these weapons and all related measures until the final stage, and ultimately, it may not reach this stage at all.

Naturally, no one can agree to this way of framing the issue. The plan to reduce conventional armaments drafted on this basis, like the phased approach that forms the basis of the "Baruch Plan" for controlling atomic weapons, is unacceptable.

This "phased approach," held in the hands of the United States, which boasts that it can "dominate the world situation," will become a convenient tool that can avoid implementing the restrictive control measures that they do not like for an indefinite period of time, but can unilaterally implement control measures on others.

The purpose of the phased approach of the "Baruch Plan" for carrying out so-called international control is to only implement international control over the first stage of atomic energy production, that is, to only control the production of raw materials, and not to implement international control over the subsequent stages of manufacturing atomic weapons. Under the circumstances that the United States monopolizes atomic weapons, this phased approach to dealing with atomic issues is very suitable for the United States, this approach will only control countries that produce atomic raw materials but have not yet manufactured atomic weapons, but will not implement any control over countries that are producing atomic weapons. Now the United States wants to adopt this set of methods here again, although it has lost its previous status as a monopolist in the manufacture of atomic weapons, it still hopes to use this set of methods to avoid implementing any control over the manufacture of the most important weapons – that is, the manufacture of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass slaughter of humanity.

We have said that all these proposals of the three powers, in the final analysis, are actually proposals to investigate armaments. And this proposal to investigate armaments must be implemented before a preliminary decision on reducing armaments and banning atomic weapons is made, therefore, its purpose is to drown the main issue – passing a decision on reducing armaments and banning atomic weapons – in the discussion of investigating armaments.

Once a decision is made on reducing armaments and banning atomic weapons, it goes without saying that all countries must submit information on armaments as soon as possible.

As early as December 1946, the Soviet delegation proposed at the first session of the United Nations General Assembly that all countries – members of the United Nations – must provide information on all their armed forces and armaments.

The United States' large-scale establishment of military bases abroad is an important measure for preparing for war

Although the issue of reducing armaments is closely related to the issue of military bases on foreign territories, the Three-Power proposal does not mention at all the issue of military bases of certain countries that the organizers of the aggressive North Atlantic bloc are establishing on foreign territories. However, when discussing armaments and armed forces, these military bases cannot be ignored, because when these military bases are located on foreign territories, military bases are a way of utilizing armaments and armed forces, a way that is most dangerous to peace. Because the United States' establishment of land, sea, and air force bases on foreign territories is one of the important measures in the plan to prepare for another world war, this is an important issue.

According to figures published in American newspapers (which are of course very incomplete and obviously reduced), the United States has more than 400 military bases on foreign territories, mainly air force bases.

It is necessary to specifically mention an indisputable fact: the American bases form a chain, aiming to surround the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries – with the help of Scandinavian countries in the north, with the help of Turkey and Greece in the south, with the help of Western European countries in the west, and with the help of Japan in the east, and Japan has now become the bridgehead, arsenal, and fortress for the North Atlantic bloc to attack the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. Various maps widely circulated by war-mongers also prove this point. Those maps show the locations of the bases, especially the locations of the air force bases, and indicate the direction of attacks from these bases on established targets.

The purpose and role of the American bases can also be seen from Churchill's statement on November 9. Churchill said in the statement that Britain has become the main American atomic base. From Churchill's statement, it can be seen that this main American atomic base has been established in accordance with the plan of the aggressive North Atlantic bloc, and its purpose is to be hostile to the Soviet Union.

Despite the very important position of various military bases in the military system of the aggressive North Atlantic bloc, the Three-Power proposal does not mention this point at all.

The United States maliciously creates international tension to find an excuse for not disarming

In Truman's statement, as well as in the statements of Mr. Acheson and Mr. Eden, and in the "Three-Power Declaration," the proposals for disarmament measures are attached with many reservations, the purpose of which is to obstruct the implementation of practical measures for disarmament and banning atomic weapons. All these reservations can only be interpreted in this way.

For example, Mr. Truman put forward the proposal for disarmament in his speech on November 7. Correctly speaking, this proposal is ultimately just a proposal to investigate armaments and armed forces. When he put forward this proposal, he attached a reservation, that is: the path to disarmament that he proposed can only be realized after an appropriate international system is established; he said: in disarmament, there must first be reliable and impartial procedures. Mr. Truman did not specify exactly what procedures he considered reliable and impartial in order to realize his proposal (I wonder if this hint refers to the veto power, which, according to them, has made our organization and procedures unreliable. I think it refers to this point). But it is already very clear: as long as this procedure, which is convenient and beneficial to American monopoly capitalists, has not been drafted, the United States has no intention of disarming. We have seen that Mr. Acheson also believes that the transition from one stage to another depends on whether certain countries increasingly prove that they have goodwill. Truman, Acheson, and Eden have all put forward the requirement of eliminating the current international tension as a prerequisite for disarmament. This condition was also widely used by the leaders of the notorious League of Nations in all discussions of disarmament. People can remember that it was precisely this condition that was put forward in the 1930s, especially at the fourth meeting of the Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference of the League of Nations, and the famous Peng Gu used it to sabotage the specific disarmament proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation at that time. His formula is very famous, that is: first security, then disarmament. At the previous sessions of the General Assembly, those who opposed disarmament only repeated this formula. Now, this formula has been more or less modernized by Mr. Truman, Mr. Acheson, and Mr. Eden, they put forward the requirement of eliminating the current "international tension" as a prerequisite for disarmament.

The purpose of the entire policy of the United States is not to ease tense international relations, but to make this tension even more severe. From this fact, it can already be seen how hypocritical the United States is in raising the issue in that way. Indeed, are not the attacks by the Tito bandits, who filed provocative slanderous accusations against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, also mainly for this purpose? Everyone can see clearly that if it were not for the instigation and encouragement – I want to say it clearly – on the part of the United States, these attacks would not have happened. If Mr. Acheson's shadow did not appear clearly behind Chiang Kai-shek, could the representative of the bankrupt Kuomintang regime reappear at the General Assembly, and even appear on the podium? Speaking of this representative's speech, we can very well quote a clever French proverb: "The ghost is possessing the body."

These facts are not isolated facts. What is the matter with the United States' continuous attempts to undermine the armistice negotiations, first in Kaesong and then in Panmunjom? What is the matter with the peace treaty with Japan? What is the matter with the division of Germany? What is the matter with the United States' attempts to establish strongholds next to the four borders of the Soviet Union in the east, west, north, and south, or to expand the strongholds that have already been established?

What is the matter with the United States' eagerness for the so-called "Near East Defense," which does not ask whether the countries of the Near East need it?

Although Mr. El-Ghouri tried his best to restrain himself, he could not help but point out that this seems a bit like the United States is preparing to interfere in the Near East.

What is the matter with the war that the countries that call themselves Egypt's allies are currently waging against Egypt, as said by the Egyptian Foreign Minister Salahuddin?

The Iranian representative, Mr. Andijan, has said that this year's events in Iran prove what the current policy of the United States and Britain is towards countries that are economically and militarily weaker. What is the matter with these events?

The rearmament and expansion of armaments in Europe is still continuing, and now it has suffocated all these countries so that they cannot breathe, including Britain (one of the main initiators of this armaments expansion plan) and France (one of the main echoers of these initiators). What is the matter with this pointless commotion of rearmament and armaments expansion? What is the significance of the North Atlantic Group's American headquarters' frenzied activities, and the gathering of the North Atlantic Group leaders in Paris this time, with the active participation of the US Secretary of Defense Lovett, General Bradley, Harriman – not to mention Acheson, Perkins, Adenauer, and the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Forces, General Eisenhower, and others who are preparing for the North Atlantic Group Council meeting to be held in Rome on November 24? The true meaning and importance of all these facts cannot be concealed even by the Paris newspaper Le Monde. Referring to what has been said above, the article published by Le Monde on November 14, entitled "American Troops Everywhere from the Atlantic to the Rhine," is very interesting. I want to quote a few paragraphs from this article. The first paragraph is: "Currently, more than 10,000 American soldiers and officers are stationed in France. This time they have come to France not to pay tribute to Lafayette. Their purpose is: first, the US military is storing war supplies and food necessary in the event of a conflict in the rear of the American troops stationed in Germany. This is a new supply line from the Atlantic ports to the Rhine."

The second paragraph is: "The kind of English that could be heard on the banks of the Potomac River or Lake Michigan on the eve of the weekend can also be heard in the aisles of first-class carriages on the train from Limoges to Paris. In Chateauroux, in Orleans, the train is filled with more and more American passengers every week. Many of them have changed out of their army khaki uniforms or blue air force uniforms for weekend fun. But they all carry military documents... On the highways of France, what travelers see is not Packard and Chevrolet cars, but canvas-covered dark green cars and trucks. On these cars, people can always see the same few words ECCZ – European Command Transportation Zone. Yes, these vehicles belong to the vehicle brigade that the Americans are gradually establishing in the rear of the occupying forces stationed in Germany."

Le Monde later said unhappily that all these activities completely ignore French sovereignty.

If we have the most straightforward attitude towards these facts, do we not have the right to boldly, affirmatively, and firmly say that the so-called elimination of international tension as a prerequisite for disarmament is a complete falsehood?

This statement is irreconcilable with the above statements, and this statement contradicts the actual behavior that constitutes the entire US foreign policy.

In any case, people must never create more and more entanglements that can cause international tension all the time, while hypocritically demanding the elimination of this entanglement.

Actual behavior is more powerful than words. Words must be judged by actual behavior. And unless words can be confirmed by actual behavior, words are not believed.

The hypocritical disarmament proposals of the US, Britain, and France are just attempts to conceal the expansion of armaments

We see that the deceptive words of the American leaders who are actively participating in the aggressive North Atlantic bloc are very different from their actual behavior. This situation fully shows that the proposals of the United States, Britain, and France regarding disarmament are false and hypocritical, indicating that they put forward this proposal in order to conceal their true intentions and the further armaments expansion movement and preparations for another major war related to this intention.

This reservation, as well as the speeches of Mr. Truman, Mr. Acheson, and Mr. Eden, and the other numerous reservations put forward in the recent "Three-Power Declaration," can only be seen as wanting to prevent the adoption of practical measures for disarmament and banning atomic weapons.

This situation is particularly evident in the way Mr. Truman, Mr. Acheson, and Mr. Eden raised the issue of the Korean War. They believe that stopping the Korean War is a necessary prerequisite, and that disarmament is impossible without stopping the Korean War. They all openly said that as long as the Korean War continues for one day, the overall plan for reducing armaments and armed forces cannot be implemented for one day.

But the United States should make this demand to itself. The United States' putting forward this condition is just a hypocritical act.

The hypocritical attitude of the US government, as well as the British and French governments, on the issue of disarmament is very obvious, because the entire responsibility for waging the barbaric war against the Korean people should be borne by the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and other member states of the North Atlantic bloc. Some government representatives attending this meeting, who have spoken on this podium, have not recognized this point. It was the United States that launched the Korean War, and it is the United States that must end this war of aggression against the Korean people. The fact that the US, British, and French governments are now demanding that the end of the Korean War be a condition or a necessary prerequisite for the so-called disarmament measures can only be seen as a clear insult to the concept of peace, and can only be seen as a clear insult to the efforts of hundreds of millions of people in all countries to strive for peace.

The attitude adopted by the United States can more powerfully prove than any words that the United States actually does not want to disarm at all.

As for the Soviet delegation's attitude towards disarmament, it has been stated very clearly. The Soviet delegation firmly believes that it is necessary to immediately start reducing armaments, regardless of whether the Korean War continues or not. (Applause)

We cannot agree in any way with the formula put forward by Truman and later repeated by Acheson and Eden, who insisted that if the Korean War does not end, if the main political issues that divide countries – as Mr. Truman said – have not been resolved, then real progress in disarmament is impossible.

If the end of the Korean War is indeed a prerequisite for disarmament and banning atomic weapons, then why not take measures to truly end this war immediately? If this is the case, then why are Mr. Ridgway, who is slaughtering peaceful residents, and his allies on the Korean front delaying the armistice negotiations with the most incredible sophistry – which can still be seen even in today's newspapers? Why?

Obviously, because it is necessary to delay the end of the Korean War. In order not to disarm and ban atomic weapons, the end of the Korean War must be delayed.

From all the facts mentioned above, the matter is very clear: the Three-Power proposal is nothing more than a propaganda conspiracy, the purpose of which is to use the rhetoric of disarmament as a smokescreen to cover up the armaments expansion movement that the organizers of the North Atlantic bloc are continuing to carry out. Even American newspapers have had to admit that the purpose of the three powers' so-called "disarmament" plan is only for propaganda purposes. This is not accidental.

In the New York Times's essay discussing this issue, such a confession can also be found: one of the main reasons why the US government put forward the "disarmament" plan is that the US allies took a stubbornly resistant attitude – in the words of the New York Times – towards the US rearmament plan at the recent meeting of the North Atlantic Group Council in Ottawa, and that the recent bellicose statements by US representatives have alarmed Western Europe. The New York Times wrote that for this reason, the United States must emphasize its "peaceful intentions." The newspaper said that the US plan is good enough for propaganda purposes alone, but it is unsuitable as a means of ending the Cold War.

An editorial in the Washington Post also admitted that Mr. Acheson's "disarmament" proposal is merely a propaganda gesture.

An essay published in the New York Herald Tribune on November 9 said that the Soviet Union's rejection of the Western countries' plan will be used by the Western countries for propaganda to shift the blame for the current armaments expansion to the Soviet Union. The newspaper also said that US officials had this purpose in mind when they began drafting their plan many weeks ago.

The New York Wall Street Journal said that the American "disarmament" plan is a pipe dream. It said: The United States' choice of the "disarmament" issue as a means of competing with the Soviet Union for the initiative is in fact extremely unreliable, because this plan ignores reality in order to suit propaganda.

It is worth noting that while the New York Times emphasized that the first task facing the United Nations is to quickly draft the Western countries' plan so that this plan can be announced to the world, it also said that the second task of the Western countries is to go full steam ahead with the rearmament plan.

One cannot fail to mention the words of American newspapers and a large number of European newspapers, which say that the reason why the three powers put forward the proposal for disarmament is that the peaceful ideas put forward by the Soviet Union and the role of the Soviet Union – in contrast to the war-mongering US government – as a fighter for peace have already been effective. The New York Herald Tribune said: Western countries put forward their own disarmament plan without consideration, with the aim of at least achieving a propaganda victory at the United Nations General Assembly.

That is the factual truth of the so-called Three-Power peace proposals. We have seen that these proposals evade the main issues that urgently need to be decided, namely the banning of atomic weapons and the reduction of armaments. These proposals want to elevate secondary issues to the status of primary issues, so that the General Assembly will not resolve the above-mentioned primary issues.

Only the Soviet Union's proposals are the true path to consolidating peace

The Soviet delegation has already presented to the General Assembly a clear plan of measures to eliminate the threat of another world war and consolidate international peace and friendship. At the beginning of our general debate, we put forward proposals on this issue, these proposals are: participation in the aggressive North Atlantic bloc is incompatible with the qualifications of a member state of the United Nations; the act of certain countries, primarily the United States, establishing military bases on foreign territories is also incompatible with the qualifications of a member state of the United Nations;

Immediately cease hostilities in Korea, conclude an armistice agreement, withdraw troops from the 38th parallel within ten days, and withdraw all foreign troops from Korea within three months;

Convene a world conference to discuss the issues of reducing armaments and armed forces, banning atomic weapons, and establishing international control to supervise the implementation of this ban;

Conclude a Five-Power – the United States, Britain, France, China, and the Soviet Union – Peace Pact.

Now, in order to further improve the above-mentioned proposals put forward on November 8, the Soviet delegation, based on the above considerations, believes that it is necessary to put forward the following supplementary proposals:

First, the General Assembly believes that the use of atomic weapons as weapons of aggression and weapons of mass slaughter of humanity is a violation of the conscience and honor of all peoples, and is incompatible with the qualifications of a member state of the United Nations, therefore, it declares an unconditional ban on atomic weapons and establishes strict international control to supervise the implementation of this ban. (Applause)

The General Assembly instructs the Atomic Energy Commission and the Conventional Armaments Commission to draft a draft convention and submit it to the Security Council for consideration before February 1, 1952. This convention shall stipulate measures to ensure that the General Assembly's decisions on banning atomic weapons, stopping the production of atomic weapons, using atomic bombs that have already been manufactured only for civilian purposes, and establishing strict international control to supervise the implementation of the above-mentioned convention can be implemented.

Second, the General Assembly recommends that the permanent members of the Security Council – the United States, Britain, France, China, and the Soviet Union – reduce their armaments and armed forces by one-third of what they possessed at the time of the adoption of this resolution within one year of the adoption of this resolution.

The representative of the Philippines said that all countries except the Soviet Union have reduced their armed forces; this is of course an absolutely incorrect and distorted statement of facts. He may have forgotten or may not have seen certain official documents. I do not want to talk too much about this issue, I am prepared to discuss it in detail later when the First Committee meets, I am willing to talk about only one point now: after the end of the war, we have demobilized thirty-three age groups of servicemen. Mr. Romulo seems to be a general: he should understand what thirty-three age groups of servicemen means. If he understands this point, if he knows this point, then he has no right to say what he has said here.

Third, the General Assembly recommends that, after the General Assembly adopts the resolution on banning atomic weapons and reducing the armaments and armed forces of the five countries by one-third, all countries should immediately – in any case, within one month – submit complete official materials on their armaments and armed forces, including materials on atomic weapons and military bases on foreign territories. These materials should be the materials at the time when the General Assembly adopted the above-mentioned resolution. (Applause)

Fourth, the General Assembly recommends the establishment of an international control organization under the Security Council, whose authority is to supervise the implementation of the resolution on banning atomic weapons and reducing armaments and armed forces and to review the information submitted by countries on their armaments and armed forces.

The importance of the above-mentioned proposals is very obvious and does not require special explanation. I think it is only necessary to talk about the supplementary proposal on the Security Council permanent members reducing their armaments and armed forces by one-third based on our proposal put forward on November 8 to convene a world conference to discuss the issue of reducing armaments and armed forces. We believe that a convenient and necessary method is: the General Assembly should put forward proposals on reducing armaments and banning atomic weapons in principle, while the world conference, which has a wider composition and is attended by all countries in the world, should consider the specific issues caused by this proposal that are related to all participants.

I want to remind you: in order to sabotage our proposal to convene a world disarmament conference, several representatives, including Mr. Pearson, the head of the Canadian delegation (everyone knows that he is also the chairman of the main council of the aggressive North Atlantic bloc), raised the question: why wait until June? Is not the General Assembly itself a disarmament conference?

Now, we are not postponing the disarmament issue to the time of the world conference, but in addition to the proposal on the world disarmament conference, we have put forward a proposal advocating that the current General Assembly consider the issue of the five countries reducing armaments by one-third and banning atomic weapons. These representatives can probably be completely satisfied now.

We firmly believe that if the proposals to resolve international outstanding issues, strive to end the United States' war in Korea, reduce armaments, etc., are not empty talk, but truly represent the efforts of the US, British, and French governments (these three countries are in a leading position in the North Atlantic bloc, and their actions can determine the political atmosphere among the government officials of several other countries), then a road – a road to making serious and responsible decisions – will truly unfold before the General Assembly. We firmly believe that the Soviet Union's proposals enable the General Assembly to resolutely and firmly embark on this road. (Prolonged applause)

　　关于消除另一次世界大战的威胁和巩固国际和平与友好的措施
    ——苏联代表团团长维辛斯基于十一月十六日在联合国大会全体会议上的演说
    主席先生，各位代表先生！
  在现在快要结束的大会一般辩论中，所有极其重要的问题，许多代表都已谈到了。这些问题主要是和美国、英国和法国代表团的发言和建议以及苏联代表团的发言和建议有关的。虽然这些建议已受到相当大的注意，但是并不是所有问题都已加以充分的解释，更不能认为话已说完了。
  我们已经指出过，三国建议被大吹大擂地说成是要裁减军队和包括原子武器在内的军备，并说成了是以减少战争危险和加强一切国家的安全为目的的，但是实质上，三国建议和这种宣传完全是两回事。人们如果仔细分析一下包含有这些建议的“三国宣言”，就不难认识这一点。我在第一次发言时自然没有机会对这个宣言作应有的比较完全的分析。我只是顺便谈到了几句。我不愿隐瞒我也曾对大会说这个宣言中的话真是使我发笑。
  美英法管制原子能计划只是对管制的嘲笑
  如果我们从像禁止原子武器这种极其重要的问题来看，就可以发现，“三国宣言”完全没有规定禁止原子武器，这是绝对不能容许的。因此，“三国宣言”中在第五点里面只限于说：所谓联合国关于管制原子能和禁止原子武器的计划仍应是节制、限制和按比例裁减一切军备和军队的总计划中与原子能有关的那一部分的基础，就决不是偶然的了。美国在过去强加于联合国大多数会员国的这个所谓管制原子能和禁止原子武器的计划，虽然说到国际管制原子能和保证在这种管制的帮助下禁止原子武器，但是实际上既没有规定禁止原子武器，也没有规定国际监督这种禁令的执行。诸位先生，这一点难道还有人不知道吗？
  美国原子能委员会，这个曾由现任国务卿艾奇逊先生主持——我很高兴，艾奇逊先生就在这里——，并得到以李连塞尔——“巴鲁区计划”的起草人之一——为首的、并有巴纳德、奥本海迈、汤姆斯等有名的原子武器制造专家参加的顾问局的帮助的委员会，早在一九四六年在说到现在“三国宣言”提到的这个所谓国际管制计划时就已指出：这个计划甚至在生效以后都不要求美国停止制造原子武器。这一点难道已被人忘记了吗？这是事实呢，还是不是事实呢？关于这个问题，我还没有得到任何答复。
  美国代表团——它那些长于诡辩的代表中像奥斯汀先生这样的人，是以对任何问题总要发言并提出反对而出名的——到现在还没有作答复。这次，他们也许至少要援引第七十四条（按指议事规则）来回答吧。我乐意把我在这儿的位置让给他们。
  他们也许会回答艾奇逊先生五年前签署的致当时国务卿贝尔纳斯先生的备忘录究竟是什么意思的问题吧；那份备忘录说：即使在所谓国际管制计划实施以后，美国也不一定停止原子武器的制造，一切事情还要看批准情况以及政治条件和国际形势而定，而参议院在与众议院一起最后决定这个问题时是不能不考虑到这些的。
  所以，“三国宣言”现在提到的计划不仅没有规定禁止制造原子武器，而且给美国保留着机会，使它甚至在国际管制计划实施后还能继续制造原子武器。
  大家知道，这就是“巴鲁区计划”的特点。这个计划的另一特点是，它规定设立这样一个原子能国际管制机构，这个机构必然会使日渐操纵整个世界经济——包括原子能资源——的美国垄断资本家拥有无限的权力；因此，这个计划不是一个国际管制计划，而是美国管制计划，这种美国管制与真正国际管制机构的任务毫无共同之处，用苏联政府元首约·维·斯大林的话来说，那是对管制的嘲笑。
  这里来追述一下下面这件事是得当的：这个计划不仅没有规定禁止原子武器，而且竟然规定——这是很奇怪的事——这个负责监督禁止原子武器的决定得以正确地、真诚地和一丝不苟地执行的所谓国际管制机构，这个仅仅为了这个目的设立的国际管制机构应该有它自己的科学研究机构来研究问题，用美国许多文件所说的话来讲，是致力于研究发展原子武器和使用原子武器。设立一个负责进行监督以使任何人不敢制造原子武器的国际管制机构，又规定这个管制机构应有特别的研究所来进一步研究继续发展原子武器的可能性，这真是天大的怪事。
  可是，根据“三国宣言”，这个计划将作为裁减军备的总计划中关于原子武器那一部分的基础。这个计划的目的不是禁止原子武器，而是使这种大批屠杀人类的野蛮武器的制造与使用合法化。不用多说，苏联过去不能同意，现在仍然不能同意这样的计划。但是，艾奇逊先生和艾登先生在这里提出的正是这样一个任何具有常识的人都不能接受的、完全不能令人满意的计划。他们向人炫耀：在他们的建议中间，也有一个建议是规定把原子武器和常规军备一道列入所谓“报告与审查制度”，想以此来诱惑别人。艾登先生把这说成是原子武器问题上的进展，他说：即使三国只提出这个建议，他们的建议也值得大会研究。
  但是，问题不在于研究这一个或其他的建议，问题在于这些建议的内容，在于它们的价值，问题在于为这个重大的严重的问题找到真正必要的、认真的解决办法。
  然而，如果不规定无条件禁止原子武器，原子武器问题就不能得到认真的解决。美国、英国、法国在“三国宣言”中却顽固地规避这样的规定。
  三国建议分阶段提供军备情报是本末倒置
  三国在它们的宣言中建议对提供军备情报问题采取决定，他们希望这种情报将分期提出，或如宣言所说，顺次分阶段地提出。
  某些人——包括前一位发言者罗慕洛将军在内——对这个宣言甚为热心。但是我并不像他那样热心。我知道他是真正的热心的人，要使他热心并不十分困难：只要建议是美国提出的，他就颂扬。
  关于这个建议，艾奇逊先生说，这个报告与审定的制度必须是待一个阶段结束后再进行另一个阶段的逐阶段发展的办法。艾奇逊继续说，首先报告最不重要的情报，然后转入比较紧要的方面。
  艾登先生在其十一月十二日的演说中也证实了这一点。他说：“我们建议，应该先从较不重要的各类军队和军备着手，然后再轮到那些比较重要的和秘密的、因而也是比较难于处理的各类军队和军备。”
  但是艾登所说的“比较重要的和秘密的各类”或者艾奇逊所说的比较易受影响的方面，正是三国为了实际上完全规避提供原子武器情报而把它放在最后阶段处理的那些棘手问题。大家都知道，原子武器属于最秘密的一类，用艾登先生的话来说，这是比较难于处理的。三国所发明的分阶段办法的真正意义便在这里，它的特点可以从艾奇逊先生与艾登先生的解释中看出：“从一个阶段到另一个阶段”的过渡要由那些掌握所谓国际管制的大权的人们任意决定。
  艾奇逊先生强调说，像在我们这样的充满了危险和猜忌的世界上，各国人民都希望得到保证，而报告与审查制度是能够提供这种保证的。他并且说，当着我们从一个阶段过渡到另一个阶段的时候，就会有愈来愈多的事实证明这种善意和诚意。艾奇逊先生说，没有这种证明，就不会有什么进展。这样来谈问题，无非是说，在依照三国计划提供军备情报方面，一个阶段之转入另一阶段必须直接取决于那些拥有更危险和更厉害的武器的国家是否认为提供第一个阶段所要求的情报的工作结果已能满意。而关于它们自己的那些更危险和更厉害的武器的情报则必须在以后的阶段中才来提供。这也无非是说，搜集军备情报，审定这种情报并实行裁减军备措施的全部计划的命运，都操在那些拥有更厉害的和更危险的武器的国家的手里。最后还应该说，这样来谈问题是表示：关于从一个阶段过渡到另一个阶段的问题也要完全靠这些国家来解决，因此这些国家会有充分的机会不让一个阶段遽然转入另一个阶段，如果这种转变证明是违反了它们的利益的话。在这里必须说明，既然原子武器或其他大批屠杀人类的武器是最厉害、最危险的武器，拥有这些武器的国家是可以独断地将关于这些武器以及一切有关措施的情报推到最后阶段才来提供，而归根结蒂说来，可能根本不会达到这个阶段。
  自然，没有人能同意问题的这种提法。在这样的基础上拟订的裁减常规军备的计划，正像作为管制原子武器的“巴鲁区计划”的基础的分阶段的办法一样，是不能为人接受的。
  这种“分阶段的办法”掌握在自夸能“左右世界大局”的美国的手中，就会成为一种便利的工具，它能够在期限不定的长时间内避免自己实施那些他们所不喜欢的限制性的管制措施，却可以单方面地对别人实行管制措施。
  进行所谓国际管制的“巴鲁区计划”的分阶段的办法，其目的是仅对原子能生产的第一阶段实行国际管制，就是说，单单管制原料的生产，对于以后制造原子武器的各阶段却不实行国际管制。在美国垄断原子武器的情况下，这种处理原子问题的分阶段的办法对美国倒是非常合适的，这种办法会单单管制那些生产原子原料然而还没有制造原子武器的国家，但是对那些正在生产原子武器的国家却不实行任何管制。现在美国又想在这里采用这一套办法，虽然它已丧失了以前在原子武器制造方面的垄断者的地位，它仍然希望用这一套办法来避免对最重要的武器的制造——就是原子武器及其他各种大批屠杀人类的武器的制造——实行任何管制。
  我们已经说过三国的所有这些建议，归根结蒂说起来，实际就是调查军备的建议。而这个调查军备的建议必须在对裁减军备和禁止原子武器未作初步决定前就执行，因此，它的目的是要把主要问题——通过关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器的决定——淹没在调查军备的谈论里。
  一俟作出关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器的决定后，所有国家就必须在尽可能短的时间内提出关于军备方面的情报，这是不言自明的。
  早在一九四六年十二月，苏联代表团在联合国大会第一届会议上就提出建议：所有国家——联合国会员国——必须把它们全部军队和军备方面的情报提供出来。
  美国大批建立国外军事基地是备战的重要措施
  虽然裁减军备问题是和外国领土上的军事基地问题密切相联系的，三国建议却根本没有谈到侵略性的北大西洋集团的组织者正在外国领土上建立的某些国家的军事基地问题。可是，在讨论军备和军队的时候，是不能把这些军事基地忽略过去的，因为当这些军事基地座落在外国领土上的时候，军事基地是利用军备和军队的一种方式，一种对于和平最具有危险性的方式。因为美国在外国领土上建立陆、海、空军基地是准备另一次世界战争的计划中的重要措施之一，所以这是一个重要的问题。
  根据美国报纸所发表的数字（这个数字当然是很不完全并显然缩小了的），美国在外国领土上有四百多个军事基地，主要是空军基地。
  有必要特别提起一个无可争辩的事实，就是：美国基地形成一条锁链，目的在包围苏联和人民民主国家——在北面靠斯堪的纳维亚国家的帮助，在南面靠土耳其和希腊的帮助，在西面靠西欧国家的帮助，在东面靠日本的帮助，而日本现在已变为北大西洋集团进攻苏联和中华人民共和国的桥头堡、兵工厂及堡垒了。战争贩子们普遍发行的各种地图也证明了这一点。那些地图表明了基地的位置，特别是空军基地的位置，并表明了从这些基地向既定的目标进行攻击的方向。
  美国基地的目的和作用还可以从邱吉尔在十一月九日发表的声明里看出来。邱吉尔在声明里曾说：英国已成为美国的主要原子基地。从邱吉尔的这个声明里可以看出：这个主要的美国原子基地已经按照侵略性的北大西洋集团的计划建立起来了，其目的就是与苏联为敌。
  尽管各种各样的军事基地在北大西洋侵略集团军队系统中占有很重要的地位，三国建议对于这一点却只字不提。
    美国恶意制造国际紧张局势为不裁军找藉口
  在杜鲁门声明中，以及在艾奇逊先生和艾登先生的声明中和“三国宣言”中，关于裁减军备的措施的建议都附有很多保留条件，其目的是阻挠关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器的实际措施的实行。所有这些保留条件只能这样解释。
  例如，杜鲁门先生在十一月七日的演说中提出裁减军备的建议。正确地说，这个建议归根结蒂只是调查军备和军队的建议，他提出这个建议时曾附带提出一个保留条件，就是：他所建议的裁减军备的途径，只有在适当的国际制度成立以后才能实现；他说：在裁减军备上，首先需要有可靠的公正的程序。杜鲁门先生并没有确切地说明，为了实现他的建议，他认为什么程序是可靠的和公正的（我想这个暗示是不是指否决权，据他们说否决权已使我们这个组织和程序变为不可靠的了。我想是指这点的）。但是这已经很清楚：只要这种对美国垄断资本家便利和有利的程序没有拟定，美国是决不打算裁减军备的。我们已经看到：艾奇逊先生也认为从一个阶段过渡到另一个阶段，要取决于某些国家是否愈来愈证明它们是具有善意的。杜鲁门、艾奇逊和艾登都提出了关于消除目前国际紧张局势的要求，作为裁减军备的先决条件。这个条件也曾经被声名狼藉的国际联盟的领袖们在讨论裁减军备的一切场合中广泛地使用过。人们都能够记忆起：在三十年代中提出来的正是这个条件，特别是在国际联盟裁军预备委员会第四次会议上，有名的彭古就是用它来破坏当时苏联代表团所提出的具体的裁军建议的。他的公式是很有名的，那就是：首先安全，然后裁军。在前几届大会上，反对裁减军备的人们只是重复了这个公式。现在，这个公式已经被杜鲁门、艾奇逊、艾登三位先生或多或少地加以时髦化了，他们提出了消除目前“国际紧张局势”的要求，作为裁减军备的先决条件。
  美国的全部政策的目的，不是缓和紧张的国际关系，而是使这种紧张局势更趋严重。从这个事实就已经可以看出，美国用那种方式提问题是多么虚伪。的确，对苏联和人民民主国家提出挑衅性的诽谤控诉案的铁托匪徒们的攻击，不也正是主要为了这个目的吗？大家都看得清楚，如果没有——我要明白地说——美国方面的主使和怂恿，这种攻击就不会发生。如果不是艾奇逊先生的影子清晰地出现在蒋某的背后，已告破产的国民党政权的代表出现在大会会场上，并且还甚至出现在讲台上，这种事情能够在本届大会上重演吗？谈到这位代表的演说，我们倒很可以引用法国的一句聪明的谚语：“鬼魂附身”。
  这些事实并不是彼此孤立的事实。美国不断地企图破坏先在开城后在板门店停战谈判，是怎么一回事呢？对日和约是怎么一回事呢？德国的分裂是怎么一回事呢？美国企图在苏联东西南北四面边界旁建立据点或扩充已经建立的据点，又是怎么一回事呢？
  美国不问近东国家是否需要即热心“防御”的所谓“近东防务”是怎么一回事呢？
  虽然埃尔—古里先生竭力抑制自己，可是他却还是不能不指出，这有点像是美国准备干涉近东。
  埃及外交大臣赛拉哈丁先生所说的自称为埃及的盟友的国家目前正在埃及进行的对埃及的战争，是怎么一回事呢？
  伊朗代表安迪让先生已经说过，伊朗今年的事件证明了美国与英国对于经济上和军事上比较弱的国家的现行政策是什么。这些事件是怎么一回事呢？
  欧洲的重新武装与扩张军备仍在继续进行中，而且现在已经使这些国家全都窒息得喘不过气来，英国（这个扩张军备计划的主要发起国之一）和法国
  （这些发起国的主要应声虫之一）也不例外。这种重新武装与扩张军备的无谓纷扰是怎么一回事呢？北大西洋集团的美国司令部的这种疯狂活动，美国国防部长罗维特、布莱德雷将军、哈里曼——更不用提艾奇逊、波金斯、阿登纳、还有北大西洋军队总司令艾森豪威尔将军及从事筹备十一月二十四日在罗马召开的北大西洋集团理事会会议的其他人了——积极参加下的北大西洋集团领袖们这次在巴黎举行的集会，其意义又是什么呢？这一切事实的真正意义与重要性，即使巴黎世界报也掩饰不了。参照上面所说的事情来看，世界报在十一月十四日发表的题为“从大西洋到莱因河全有美军”那篇文章，是很使人感到兴趣的。我要引用这篇文章中的几段。第一段是：“目前有一万余名美军士兵与军官驻在法国。这次他们到法国来不是为了向拉斐德致敬的。他们的目的是：第一，美军正在驻德美军的后方储存一旦发生冲突时所必需的战争供应品与粮食。这是从大西洋各港口到莱因河的一条新的供应线。
  第二段是：“周末前夕能够在波达麦克河或密执安湖的岸边听到的那种英语，在里摩日到巴黎的火车中头等车厢的过道上，也可以听到。在沙托卢，在奥尔良，火车每星期都载满了愈来愈多的美国乘客。他们中间有许多人为了周末的欢乐而换掉了他们的陆军卡叽布制服或蓝色的空军制服。但是他们全都携有军事证件……在法国的公路上，旅客们触目的不是派克牌和雪佛莱牌的汽车，而是布篷的暗绿色汽车和卡车。在这些车子上面，人们总可以看到同样的几个字ECCZ——欧洲司令部交通区。不错，这些车辆是属于美国人正在驻德占领军的后方逐渐建立起来的车辆大队的。”
  世界报后来怏怏不乐地说，所有这些活动，都完全忽视了法国的主权。
  如果我们对这些事实抱着最直言无隐的态度，难道我们没有权利大胆地、肯定地、坚决地说所谓消除国际紧张局势是裁减军备的先决条件这种话是彻头彻尾虚假的吗？
  这种话与上面的话是不调和的，这种话与构成整个美国外交政策的实际行为是矛盾的。
  不管怎样，人们决不可时时刻刻制造愈来愈多的足以引起国际紧张局势的纠葛，同时却又伪善地要求消除这种纠葛。
  实际行为是比言语更有力量的。言语是要用实际行为来判断的。而且除非言语能够得到实际行为的证实，否则言语是不为人相信的。
  美英法裁军的伪善建议只是企图掩饰扩军
  我们看到，积极参加侵略性的北大西洋集团的美国领袖的骗人言语和他们的实际行为大不相同。这种情况充分表明美国、英国和法国关于裁减军备的建议是虚假的、伪善的，表明他们提出这个建议是为了掩饰他们的真正意图以及与这种意图有关的进一步的扩张军备运动和另一次大战的准备工作。
  这种保留条件以及杜鲁门先生、艾奇逊先生和艾登先生的演说和最近的“三国宣言”中提出的其他许许多多保留条件，只能看做是想使裁减军备和禁止原子武器的实际措施不被采纳。
  这种情况在杜鲁门、艾奇逊和艾登三位先生对朝鲜战争问题的提法中表现得特别明显。他们认为停止朝鲜战争是必要的先决条件，不停止朝鲜战争就不可能裁减军备。他们都公开说，只要朝鲜战争继续进行一天，裁减军备和军队的总计划就一天不能实行。
  但是美国应当向它自己提出这种要求。美国提出这种条件只是一种伪君子的做法罢了。
  美国政府以及英国和法国政府在裁减军备问题上的这种伪善态度是非常明显的，因为对朝鲜人民进行野蛮战争的全部责任正应当由美国、英国、法国以及其他若干北大西洋集团会员国政府担负。出席这个会议、曾在这个讲坛上发言的某些政府代表没有认识到这一点。发动朝鲜战争的是美国，必须结束这场对朝鲜人民的侵略战争的正是美国。美国、英国和法国政府现在竟然要求以结束朝鲜战争，作为所谓裁减军备措施的条件或必要的先决条件，这只能看做是对和平这个概念的明显侮辱，只能看做是对一切国家亿万人民争取和平的努力的明显侮辱。
  美国采取的这种态度比任何言语都更能够有力地证明美国实际上完全不希望裁减军备。
  至于苏联代表团关于裁减军备的态度，那已经说得十分清楚了。苏联代表团坚决认为需要立即开始裁减军备，不管朝鲜战争是否继续下去。（掌声）
  我们无论如何不能同意杜鲁门所提出的、后来经艾奇逊与艾登复述的公式，他们硬说如果朝鲜战争不结束，如果分裂各国的主要政治问题——像杜鲁门先生所说的——仍未解决，裁减军备不可能有真正进展。
  如果朝鲜战争的结束的确是裁减军备和禁止原子武器的先决条件，那末为什么不采取措施立刻真正结束这个战争呢？如果是这样，正在屠杀和平居民的李奇微先生及其在朝鲜前线的盟友先生们为什么用最令人难以相信的诡辩——即使在今天的报纸上也可以看到——来拖延停战谈判呢？为什么？
  明显地，因为这是为了延迟结束朝鲜战争所必需的。为了不裁减军备和禁止原子武器，朝鲜战争的结束必须延迟。
  从上面所说的一切事实来看，事情是非常清楚的：三国建议不过是宣传上的阴谋而已，目的是要用裁减军备的言论来作为掩饰北大西洋集团组织者正在继续进行的扩张军备运动的烟幕。甚至美国报纸也不得不承认，三国的所谓“裁减军备”计划的目的只是为了进行宣传。这不是偶然的。
  在纽约时报论述这个问题的论文中，也能够找到这样的招供：美国政府提出“裁减军备”计划的主要原因之一是北大西洋集团理事会最近在渥太华举行会议时，美国的盟国对于美国的重整军备计划采取了——用纽约时报的话——顽强反抗的态度，并且，美国代表们最近的好战声明使西欧感到惊慌。纽约时报写道，由于这个缘故，美国必须强调它的“和平意图”。该报说，仅仅为了宣传目的，美国的计划是够好的，但是作为结束冷战的手段，这是不相宜的。
  华盛顿邮报的社论也承认，艾奇逊先生的“裁减军备”建议仅仅是宣传姿态。
  纽约先驱论坛报在十一月九日发表的论文中说，苏联拒绝西方国家的计划，将被西方国家利用来进行宣传，把目前扩张军备的罪过转嫁给苏联。该报并说，美国官员们在许多星期之前开始草拟他们的计划时就是抱着这个目的。
  纽约华尔街日报说美国的“裁减军备”计划是异想天开。它说：美国选择
  “裁减军备”问题作为向苏联争夺主动权的手段，事实上是极不可靠的，因为这个计划为了适合宣传而忽略了现实。
  值得注意的是：纽约时报一方面着重地说联合国面临的第一个任务就是赶紧拟订西方国家的计划以便把这个计划向全世界公布，另一方面又说西方国家的第二个任务是开足马力进行重整军备计划。
  人们不能不提到美国报纸和很大一部分的欧洲报纸的话，它们说，三国提出裁减军备的建议，是由于苏联所提出的和平思想和苏联——恰和战争贩子美国政府相反——所起的和平斗士的作用已经有了成效。纽约先驱论坛报说：西方国家不加考虑地提出了他们自己的裁减军备计划，目的是要在联合国大会上至少取得宣传战的胜利。
  所谓三国和平建议的事实真相就是这样。我们已经看到，这些建议规避了急需立即决定的主要问题，就是禁止原子武器和裁减军备的问题。这些建议要把次要的问题提到主要地位上来，从而使大会不去解决上述的主要问题。
    只有苏联的建议才是巩固和平的真正道路
  苏联代表团已经向大会提出了消除另一次世界大战的威胁和巩固国际和平与友好的措施的明确计划。在我们的一般辩论一开始的时候，我们就提出了关于这一问题的建议，这些建议就是：参加侵略性的北大西洋集团是和联合国会员国的资格不相容的；某些国家，首先是美国，在外国领土上建立军事基地的行为，也是和联合国会员国的资格不相容的；
  立即停止朝鲜境内的敌对行动，缔结停战协定，在十天以内把军队撤离三十八度线，一切外国军队在三个月内撤出朝鲜；
  召开世界会议讨论裁减军备与军队以及禁止原子武器和建立国际管制以监督这一禁令的执行的问题；
  缔结五大国——美国、英国、法国、中国、苏联——和平公约。
  现在，苏联代表团为了使十一月八日提出的上述建议更加完善起见，基于上述考虑，认为有必要提出下列补充建议：
  第一，大会认为把原子武器当作侵略的武器和大批屠杀人类的武器来使用，是违反各国人民的良知和荣誉的，是与联合国会员国的资格不相容的，因此宣布无条件禁止原子武器并建立严格的国际管制以监督这一禁令的执行。（掌声）
  大会责成原子能委员会和常规军备委员会草拟公约草案，于一九五二年二月一日前提交安全理事会审议。这个公约中要规定一些措施，确保大会关于禁止原子武器、停止原子武器的生产、把已经制成的原子弹只用于民用目的以及建立严格的国际管制以监督上述公约的执行情形的各项决定能够得到执行。
  第二，大会建议安全理事会常任理事国——美国、英国、法国、中国与苏联——在本决议通过后一年的时间中，将它们在本决议通过时所拥有的军备与军队裁减三分之一。
  菲律宾代表说，除了苏联以外，所有国家都已裁减了它们的军队；这当然是绝对不正确的、歪曲事实的说法。他也许已经忘记、也许没有看过某些官方文件。我不愿多谈这方面的问题，我准备以后在第一委员会开会时再详细讨论，我现在愿意只谈一点：在战争结束以后，我们已使三十三役龄级的服役人员复员。罗慕洛先生似乎是一个将军：他应当懂得三十三役龄级的服役人员是什么意义。如果他懂得这一点，如果他知道这一点，那末他就毫没有权利说出他在这里说过的话。
  第三，大会建议，在大会通过关于禁止原子武器和裁减五国军备和军队三分之一的决议以后，所有国家应当立即——无论如何要在一个月以内——提出关于它们的军备和军队的完全的官方材料，包括关于原子武器和在外国领土上的军事基地的材料。这些材料应为大会通过上述决议时的材料。（掌声）
  第四，大会建议成立一个隶属于安全理事会的国际管制机构，其职权为监督关于禁止原子武器和裁减军备与军队的决议的执行并审查各国提出的关于它们的军备和军队的情报。
  上述各项建议的重要性是很明显的，不需要特别解释。我认为只需要根据我们十一月八日提出的召开世界会议讨论裁减军备与军队问题的建议来谈谈关于安全理事会常任理事国裁减军备与军队三分之一的补充建议。我们认为方便而且必要的方法是：由大会在原则上提出裁减军备和禁止原子武器的建议，而由成分更为广泛、世界所有国家都参加的世界会议来考虑这种建议所引起的、有关全体与会者的具体问题。
  我要提醒你们：为了破坏我们所提出的召开世界裁军会议的建议，有几个代表，其中包括加拿大代表团团长皮尔逊先生（大家知道他还是侵略性北大西洋集团主要理事会的主席），提出问题说：为什么要等到六月呢？大会本身不就是一个裁军会议吗？
  我们现在不把裁军问题推迟到世界会议的时候，而在关于世界裁军会议的建议之外，又提出了建议，主张由现在的大会审议五国裁减军备三分之一与禁止原子武器的问题，这几位代表现在大概可以完全满意了吧。
  我们深信：如果解决国际悬案、努力结束美国在朝鲜的战争、裁减军备等项建议不是空谈，而是真正表示了美英法三国（这三国在北大西洋集团中居于领导地位，它们的行为可以决定其他若干国家政府人士中间的政治气氛）的努力的话，那末在大会的面前就会真正展开一条道路——作出认真负责的决定的道路。我们深信：苏联的建议使大会能够果断而坚决地走上这条道路。（经久不息的掌声）（新华社据塔斯社巴黎十七日电）
