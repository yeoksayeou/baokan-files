　　Improving Production Tools to Increase Yield Per Unit Area
    Farmers in Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province, Enthusiastically Welcome New Farm Tools
    Many farmers in Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province, have greatly increased their yield per unit area by using new-style farm tools. The prefecture's farm tool station promoted 2,300 new-style farm tools this year. According to experiments by Gao Guishan, a labor model in Tunliu County, last autumn, sowing wheat on one mu of land with the same variety, soil quality, and fertilizer, half was plowed with a new plow and half with an old plow. The result was that the land plowed with the new plow yielded an average of 310 jin of wheat per mu, while the land plowed with the old plow yielded an average of 252 jin per mu, a difference of 58 jin less per mu compared to the new plow. The Weishuanghai Mutual Aid Team in Baduling Village, Fifth District, Lingchuan County, used new-style plows to cultivate 67 mu of land this year. The labor and fertilizer used were the same as last year, but the average yield per mu increased by 2 to 3 dou of grain compared to last year. Because the improvement of production tools has increased the yield per unit area, farmers are even more eager to purchase new-style plows. Nearly one hundred mutual aid teams in Lingchuan County have requested to purchase new-style plows. In September, the county government purchased 140 new-style plows and 120 small corn threshers from the prefecture's farm tool station for the sixth time, and by the end of the month, it had sold 138 new plows and more than 40 corn threshers. Farmers in Jincheng and Pingshun counties also hope to purchase new-style farm tools. The widespread adoption of new-style farm tools has consolidated and expanded mutual aid teams. The Pangjiachuan mutual aid organization in Lingchuan, due to the use of new-style farm tools, increased production, and the number of mutual aid teams in the whole village has increased from one this spring to nineteen, and they have purchased eight new-style plows and one chaff cutter.

　　改进生产工具提高单位面积产量
    山西长治专区农民热烈欢迎新农具
    山西省长治专区不少农民，由于使用了新式农具，大大提高了单位面积产量。该专区农具站今年推广了两千三百部新式农具，据屯留县劳动模范高贵山试验，去秋以同样品种、土质、肥料播种一亩麦子，一半用新犁耕，一半用旧犁耕，结果用新犁耕的土地每亩平均收三百一十斤麦子，用旧犁耕的土地每亩平均收二百五十二斤，较新犁耕的每亩少收五十八斤麦。陵川县五区八犊岭村魏双孩互助组今年用新式犁耕的六十七亩地，所用人工和肥料都和去年一样，但平均每亩比去年多收二至三斗粮。由于生产工具的改进提高了单位面积产量，因而农民对购买新式犁的要求也就更加迫切。陵川县有将近一百个互助组要求购买新式犁。九月份该县人民政府从专区农具站第六次购回新式犁一百四十部，小型玉米脱粒机一百二十部，到月底即售出新犁一百三十八部，玉米脱粒机四十余部。晋城、平顺等县的农民也希望能购买到新式农具。新式农具的广泛被采用，巩固和扩大了互助组。陵川庞家川互助组织由于使用了新式农具，提高了产量，全村互助组已由今春的一个组增至十九个组，并购进了八部新式犁和一部铡草机。
