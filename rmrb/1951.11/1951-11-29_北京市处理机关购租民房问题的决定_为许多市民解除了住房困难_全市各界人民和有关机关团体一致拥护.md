Beijing's Decision on Handling the Issue of Government Agencies Purchasing and Renting Private Housing
Resolves Housing Difficulties for Many Citizens
People from All Walks of Life and Relevant Organizations Throughout the City Unanimously Support It

[This newspaper report] Since the Beijing Municipal People's Government announced its decision on November 1 concerning the handling of the purchase and rental of private housing by government agencies, organizations, and state-owned enterprises, it has been warmly supported by people from all walks of life. In particular, those who are eager to move but cannot find houses feel very grateful for the care shown by the People's Government. At present, relevant agencies and state-owned enterprises in Beijing have been making various efforts to overcome their own difficulties and have begun to return the private houses they purchased or rented after September 1, returning them to their original residents or renting them to other citizens who cannot find housing.

The main content of this decision of the Beijing Municipal People's Government is that private houses purchased, rented, mortgaged, or borrowed by government agencies, organizations, and state-owned enterprises after September 1, will be returned in all cases, except for a few types of houses that do not compete with the people, as stipulated by the Municipal People's Government. The original residents will continue to live in them or move back in; if the original residents have moved out and do not want to move back, the houses will be taken over by the Municipal Public and Counter-revolutionary Property Management Bureau, and the Municipal Land Administration Bureau will be responsible for introducing them to citizens who urgently need housing. According to incomplete statistics from the Municipal Land Administration Bureau, from September 1 to October 16, government agencies, organizations, and state-owned enterprises purchased and rented a total of 124 private houses, totaling 3,180 and a half rooms. Among them, 30 houses and 891 rooms are in accordance with the decision of the Municipal People's Government and should not be returned. The remaining houses generally need to be returned to the citizens. In this way, many original residents will no longer have to pay high prices to rent houses, or live in doorways, shacks, or inns, or crowd in with relatives and friends. The difficulties in life, work, and children's education caused by moving will also be readily solved.

The shortage of housing in Beijing is fundamentally due to the rapid development of various construction projects in the capital and the rapid increase in population. Although the Municipal People's Government has made many efforts, such as encouraging and leading citizens to repair old houses and build new houses, it still cannot keep up with the current needs. Many government agencies, organizations, and state-owned enterprises also have narrow and crowded housing, so purchasing and renting private housing has relatively increased the housing difficulties of citizens. Under these circumstances, the Municipal People's Government made a timely decision to first take care of the housing problem of the masses, preferring to let government agencies, organizations, and state-owned enterprises live a little more crowded for the time being. People from all walks of life are deeply moved by this spirit of completely prioritizing the interests of the people and solving the difficulties of the masses, and they all say that only the People's Government led by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party can do this. In particular, the working people who are about to move and cannot find houses, or have already moved, unanimously thank the People's Government for solving difficulties for the people. Meng Haiquan, Zhao Yulin, Zhu Xi, and others, residents of No. 41 Liuxue Road, immediately took their household registration books to the real estate exchange to register upon hearing the news. After the house at No. 18 Shuangzhalan, Xidan, was sold to the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the original resident, rickshaw worker Liu Peirun, although realizing that the cooperative bought this house to seek welfare for the people, could not afford the high rent due to his large family and had not been able to rent a new house. While he was worrying, comrades from the Public and Counter-revolutionary Property Management Bureau suddenly came to tell him that he could continue to live there. He excitedly said: "The People's Government is really thinking for the people!" The house at No. 52 Qianfu Hutong, Xipi City, was sold to the head office of the Bank of China. A family surnamed Chang had to temporarily live in their family's house because they could not find a house. However, the population of his family was also very large, so it was inconvenient to even turn around. There were also two families in the house who were very worried because the rent of the newly found house was very high and far from their workplaces. They were very moved when they saw the news in the newspaper, and they said to everyone they met: "Chairman Mao's eyes are so sharp, he saw our difficulties." There is also a house in the same hutong that was sold to the head office of the Bank of China. Yang Jinjun, a small businessman who makes a living by shaking coal balls, has a family of twelve. He had registered to find a house at eight real estate exchanges, and only recently found three small rooms, with a monthly rent of 130 catties of millet, and a deposit of 15 bolts of cloth. These three small rooms are not only not enough for twelve people, but they are also very dilapidated. The wall behind has collapsed. In order to pay the deposit and repair the house, he has no capital to do business. Yang's wife said: Our whole family is living off our savings and we are very worried. Now the People's Government has saved us and we don't have to move anymore. The Yuchun Yuan Oil, Salt, and Grain Store in Hepingmen also stopped operating for more than 20 days because the landlord sold the house to the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China. The store manager Li Xiufeng said: I really didn't expect the People's Government to take this measure so that we can continue to operate.

In order to solve the housing difficulties of citizens, the Municipal Land Administration Bureau has recently conducted a special survey on the situation of citizens who have registered to find housing at the real estate exchange. After consultation and research, the relevant central and municipal agencies decided to return the first batch of 68 private houses, totaling 1,705 and a half rooms. A few days ago, 20 private houses, totaling 405 and a half rooms, have been returned by 13 municipal agencies and state-owned enterprises, including the Municipal Public Health Bureau, and have been taken over by the Municipal Public and Counter-revolutionary Property Management Bureau. On the 12th of this month, the Municipal Land Administration Bureau notified the original residents of these houses: those who originally wanted to move out but have not moved out can no longer move out, and those who have moved out and have not found a house to live in can register at the real estate transaction branch in their respective jurisdictions within a week and can rent them as soon as possible.

The broad masses of citizens, especially the working people whose lives are difficult due to moving, are eagerly hoping to solve their housing problems. Therefore, relevant agencies, organizations, and state-owned enterprises should resolutely support the Municipal People's Government's decision on returning houses and take practical actions quickly. Use these actions to prove to the masses that the People's Government's agencies, the people's organizations, and the people's enterprises are able to implement the basic idea of serving the people.

    北京市处理机关购租民房问题的决定
    为许多市民解除了住房困难
    全市各界人民和有关机关团体一致拥护
    【本报讯】北京市人民政府关于处理机关、团体和公营企业等购租民房问题的决定于十一月一日公布以后，各界人民一致热烈拥护。特别是急于搬家而又找不到房子的人，更对人民政府给他们的关怀，感到十分亲切。现北京市有关机关和公营企业等已用各种努力克服自己的困难，开始退出九月一日以后所购租的民房，交由原住户居住，或租给其他找不到房屋的市民居住。
    北京市人民政府这一决定的主要内容，是机关、团体和公营企业在九月一日以后所购、租、典、借的民房，除合于市人民政府所规定的几种与民无争的房屋外，一律退出，由原住户继续居住或迁回居住；原住户已迁出而不愿迁回者，则由市公逆产清管局接管，由市地政局负责介绍给迫切需要房屋的市民租住。根据市地政局的不完全统计，机关、团体和公营企业等从九月一日到十月十六日共购租民房一百二十四所，三千一百八十间半，其中有三十所、八百九十一间合于市人民政府的决定，不应退出。其余的房屋一般需要退给市民居住。这样一来，许多原住户即可不必再去出高价租房子，或者住在门道、窝棚和旅馆客栈里，或者挤住在亲戚朋友家里。他们因搬家而引起的生活、工作和子女求学等困难，也迎刃而解。
    北京市的房屋本来很短缺，根本原因是首都各项建设事业迅速发展，人口迅速增加。虽经市人民政府多方努力，如鼓励和领导市民修缮旧房，增建新房等，但仍赶不上目前的需要。许多机关、团体和公营企业等的住房也很窄狭拥挤，因此购租民房，相对地增加了市民住房的困难。在这种情况下，市人民政府及时作出决定，首先照顾群众的住房问题，宁肯让机关、团体和公营企业等暂时住得拥挤一些。这种完全以人民的利益为利益、以解决群众困难为第一的精神，各界人民深受感动，都说只有毛主席共产党所领导的人民政府才能这样作。特别是要搬家而又找不到房子、或已搬家的劳动人民，更异口同声感谢人民政府为人民解决困难。原住留学路四十一号的居民孟海泉、赵玉林、朱锡等，一听到消息，马上拿着户口簿到房地产交易所去登记。西单双栅栏十八号的房屋卖给市供销合作总社以后，原住户三轮车工人刘佩润虽然认识到合作总社买了这所房子，也是用来给人民谋福利的；可是他家人口多，出不起过高的租钱，一直没有租妥新房。他正在发愁，公逆产清管局的同志忽然来告诉他可以继续住下去。他兴奋地说：“人民政府真是为人民打算！”西皮市前府胡同五十二号的房子卖给中国银行总管理处，该房有一家姓常的因找不到房子，只好暂住在本家的房里。而他本家的人口也很多，因此连转一个身都很不方便。该房内还有两家因新找到的房子租金很高，和自己的工作地点离得又远，非常发愁。他们看到报上的消息，十分感动，逢人便说：“毛主席的眼睛真亮，看到了咱们的困难。”在同一胡同里还有一所房子卖给了中国银行总管理处。该院靠摇煤球为生的小商人杨劲君，一家十二口人。他在八个房地产交易所都登记找过房，直到最近才找到三间小房，每月租金一百三十斤小米，还要交十五匹布的押金。这三间小房不但住不下十二口人，而且非常破烂，后面的墙倒塌了，他为了交押金和修理房子，现已没有本钱作生意。杨的老婆说：我们全家人坐吃山空，都很发愁。现在人民政府算是救了我们，可以不再搬家了。和平门里的裕春源油盐粮店，也因房主将房卖给中国人民银行北京分行，已经停业二十多天。该店的掌柜李秀峰说：我真没有想到人民政府会采取这一措施，使我们得以继续营业。
    市地政局为了解决市民的住房困难，已于日前专门调查了在房地产交易所登记找房的市民的情况。中央和市级有关机关经商量研究后决定，第一批退出民房六十八所，一千七百零五间半。日前市公共卫生局等十三个市级机关和公营企业已退出民房二十所，共四百零五间半，交由市公逆产清管局接管。本月十二日，市地政局曾通知这些房屋的原住户：原先要搬家而未搬出的，可以不再搬出，已搬出而没有找到房屋住的，在一星期之内到各该管区的房地产交易分所登记，可尽先租用。
    广大市民，特别是因搬家而引起生活困难的劳动人民，都迫切地希望解决自己的住房问题。因此有关机关、团体和公营企业等应坚决拥护市人民政府关于退房的决定，迅速采取实际行动。用这些行动向群众证明：人民政府的机关，人民的团体和人民的企业是能够贯彻为人民服务的基本思想的。
