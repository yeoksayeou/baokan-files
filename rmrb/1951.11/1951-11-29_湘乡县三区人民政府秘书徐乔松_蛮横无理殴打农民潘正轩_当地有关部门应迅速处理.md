    Xu Qiaosong, Secretary of the Third District People's Government of Xiangxiang County
    Barbarically and Unreasonably Beat Farmer Pan Zhengxuan
    Local Departments Concerned Should Handle This Swiftly
    Editor: Xu Qiaosong, the secretary of the Third District People's Government of Xiangxiang County, Hunan Province, unreasonably beat the farmer Pan Zhengxuan, severely damaging the prestige of the People's Government among the people. On November 2nd, Xu Qiaosong went to the Xiwan Township People's Government in the Third District to hold a cadre meeting. When resting at night, he saw the farmer Pan Zhengxuan resting on the bed of the township government chairman. Xu Qiaosong asked the township government correspondent Pan Yulin (Pan Zhengxuan's cousin), "Who is sleeping on the bed?" Pan Yulin said, "He is hired by the township government to work." Xu then said, "I think this person must be a bad guy, don't let him rest here, wake him up and kick him out." When Pan Zhengxuan heard that he was going to be kicked out, he wanted to walk outside, but was stopped by Xu Qiaosong. Xu interrogated Pan Zhengxuan, saying, "Why are you resting here? Do you know this is a government office? Judging by your looks, you are not a good person. If you behave well, then fine, if not, I will give you a beating!" Pan Zhengxuan said, "The People's Government is not allowed to beat people." When Xu heard this, he jumped up and said, "Oh! Not allowed to beat people? I'll beat you!" Saying that, he slapped Pan Zhengxuan several times, pushed Pan out the door, slapped him several more times, and said, "Tie him up with a rope!" The correspondent Pan Yulin explained to Xu, "This is my cousin, I can vouch for him." Xu not only didn't listen but retorted, "You are also a bad guy, get out with him!" Finally, Pan Zhengxuan was kicked out. The issue of Xu Qiaosong beating people was reported to the Xiangxiang Third District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, but they did not handle it.
    Xu Qiaosong is a staff member of the People's Government. His barbaric and unreasonable behavior of beating people has left a very bad impression among the masses. We hope that the local leaders will deal with this issue seriously.

    湘乡县三区人民政府秘书徐乔松
    蛮横无理殴打农民潘正轩
    当地有关部门应迅速处理
    编辑同志：湖南省湘乡县第三区人民政府秘书徐乔松无理殴打农民潘正轩，严重地破坏了人民政府在人民群众中的威信。十一月二日，徐乔松到三区下湾乡人民政府开干部会，在夜晚休息时，看见农民潘正轩在乡政府主席的床上休息。徐乔松问乡政府通信员潘玉林（潘正轩的堂弟）说：“床上睡的是谁？”潘玉林说：“是乡政府请来做工的。”徐又说：“我看这个人一定是个坏家伙，不要叫他在这里歇，给我喊起来赶出去。”潘正轩听说要赶他，就想向外走，却被徐乔松截住了。徐审问潘正轩说：“你怎么在这里歇？你晓不晓得这是政府机关？看你就不是个好东西，搞得好就好，搞得不好就给你一顿打！”潘正轩说了一句“人民政府是不许打人的”，徐听了就跳起来说：“吓！不打人，我就打你！”说着就打了潘正轩几个耳光，把潘推出门外，又打了几个耳光，还说：“拿绳子把他吊起来！”通信员潘玉林给徐解释说：“这是我的堂兄，我可以担保。”徐不但不听，反说：“你也是个坏家伙，给我一起滚出去！”最后，把潘正轩赶了出去。徐乔松打人的问题反映到中共湘乡三区区委员会，他们也没有进行处理。
    徐乔松是人民政府的工作人员，他这种无理打人的恶劣作风，在群众中留下了很坏的影响，我们希望当地领导方面对这一问题作严正的处理。
