　　America's War Policy
　　Jing Bo
　　World War II caused an increase in American industrial production and an expansion of industrial productivity. The manufacturing industrial production index reached its peak in 1943, at 228 (with 1937 as 100).

　　After the war, due to the detachment of China and many countries in Eastern Europe from the international capitalist system, the rise of national liberation movements in colonies and semi-colonies around the world, and the enormous war wounds suffered by Western European countries, the American foreign market greatly shrank. At the same time, in the short term after the war, the wartime savings on which the purchasing power of the American people depended were rapidly consumed due to the soaring prices caused by the continuous expansion of monopoly capital profits, so that the American domestic market also gradually shrank. Therefore, by the end of 1946, the American manufacturing industrial production index had fallen to 157, a decrease of 31 percent compared to 1943. During the same period, the production of processing industries fell by 23 percent, and the production of durable goods production sectors fell by 47 percent.

　　By 1947, due to the U.S. government's implementation of the "Truman Doctrine" "Cold War" policy, strengthening domestic military production and foreign military "aid," the American manufacturing industrial production index slightly increased this year, to 172. In 1948, the American manufacturing industrial production index continued to rise to 175 under the stimulus of the "Marshall Plan." But by 1949, various economic indexes had been declining continuously, production was reduced, prices fell, unemployment increased, and the storm of economic crisis showed signs of approaching.

　　This situation determined the policy direction of the American ruling group at home and abroad. This direction is to use military production to replace civilian production, use arms exports to replace capital and commodity exports, and use war investment to replace ordinary investment under the general direction of opposing the Soviet Union, China and other people's democratic countries, opposing the world's people's forces, and attempting to dominate the world - this is the foundation for the American ruling group to implement a fascist policy domestically and an expansionist policy of preparing for new wars and even finally launching armed aggression against Korea. From an economic point of view, this is the American policy of "exporting unemployment" and "exporting crisis."

　　The American armed aggression against Korea in June 1950 was the actual war action taken by the United States after the failure of the "Cold War" policy, with the aim of trying to curb the sharp decline in the domestic production level in the United States, alleviate the crisis, extract new high profits, and thereby prepare to launch a third world war.

　　The total amount of military appropriations passed in the first year (1951) after the start of the American invasion of Korea reached 61 billion US dollars, an increase of two times compared to the previous year, accounting for 30 percent of the actual national income in 1951. According to American official figures, American military spending in the 1952 fiscal budget reached 81.8 billion US dollars, accounting for more than 36 percent of the estimated actual national income for that year. Closely related to the sharp increase in military spending is the expansion of military-related industries. In the year since the outbreak of the Korean War, the production indexes of industries related to military supplies, such as machinery, gasoline, coal, rubber, and chemical manufacturing, have increased by 20 to 30 percent.

　　The intensification of the militarization of the American economy can also be seen from its foreign trade in the past year. The increase in American exports mainly relies on the export of weapons; and the increase in imports relies on the import of military strategic raw materials used for war production and strategic storage. Exports in the first half of 1951 increased by 40 percent compared to the same period last year, and all of the increase was in the export of weapons. The figures in the foreign military aid bill passed by the U.S. Congress in the 1951 fiscal year show that U.S. weapons exports this year, including all forms, exceeded 5 billion U.S. dollars.

　　In the first half of 1951, American imports increased by 33 percent compared to the same period last year, and the increase in imports was mainly due to the increase in imports of natural rubber, wool, non-ferrous metals, etc. The military nature of import trade has created a phenomenon of American gold outflow. In order to pay for the import of strategic raw materials, the United States exported 178.8 million US dollars in gold in the first half of 1951 (only 7 million US dollars in the same period last year).

　　The sharp increase in military expenditures has brought unprecedentedly huge profits to the American monopoly capital groups. In 1950, the total profits of American companies reached 41 billion US dollars, an increase of more than 40 percent compared to 1949. According to the figures for the first quarter of this year (calculated at an annual rate), the total profit in 1951 will reach 51 billion US dollars.

　　While the militarization of the American economy has fattened monopoly capitalists, it has also drained the blood and sweat of the American working people.

　　Large-scale production of munitions and weapons has caused a lack of raw materials and machine tools, and some civilian industries have been forced to suspend production and reduce production on a large scale. According to the New York Times, the output of light vehicles in the third quarter of this year decreased by 30 percent compared to the second quarter of last year, household electrical equipment also decreased by 30 percent, and washing machines decreased by 50 percent. The reduction in consumer goods is not only due to the lack of raw materials and machine tools, but also because the expansion of the military has squeezed the working people dry and greatly reduced their consumption power. It can be seen that even if civilian productivity is reduced, it cannot reduce the seriousness of the sluggish sales of civilian industrial products. According to the Wall Street Journal on July 11, quoting figures from the U.S. Department of Commerce, at the end of May 1951, the total value of all industrial and commercial inventories reached 69.7 billion US dollars, while it was 53.3 billion US dollars in the same period in 1950.

　　The expansion of the military has brought about soaring prices. In the second quarter of this year, the American wholesale price index rose by 18 percent compared to the same period last year, and retail prices also rose sharply. Prices and the cost of living have risen, but the wage increases of ordinary workers have not kept up with the price increases. In individual civilian industrial sectors, such as the printing industry, the leather industry, and the clothing industry, the wage increases of workers have far lagged behind the rate of price increases.

　　At the same time as prices are soaring and real wages are falling, the U.S. Senate recently passed a $5.5 billion tax increase bill. According to the U.S. government budget for the 1951 fiscal year, the additional military appropriations figures after the outbreak of the war against Korea, and the U.S. population in 1950, the American people bear $554 per capita in government expenditures for the 1951 fiscal year, which is estimated to reach $657 in the 1952 fiscal year, which is equivalent to about one-quarter of the annual salary of the lowest wage earners. This is how the American monopoly capital groups are frantically attacking the living standards of the working people.

　　As a result of the U.S. government's implementation of the policy of expanding the army and preparing for war, the number of unemployed in American non-military industries is constantly increasing. Many shoe companies, automobile companies, furniture companies, and some other industries that produce non-military supplies have begun to switch from full-time to part-time, or simply close their factories, and a large number of workers have been laid off. Even General Motors, the largest monopoly capital enterprise in the United States, will lay off a large number of workers who manufacture civilian cars.

　　For a year, under the heavy burden of the U.S. government's plan to expand the army and prepare for war, the lives of the American working class have become increasingly difficult. The strike movement has been booming in different industries across the United States, and large-scale strikes have occurred in steel, automobile, and railway transportation companies.

　　At the same time, despite the U.S. government's frantic persecution of the American Communist Party and progressive forces, the peace movement is still booming throughout the United States. The All-American Peace Congress was held in Chicago at the end of June this year, with representatives of 5,000 American people participating.

　　The above is the face of America today.

　　The U.S. government's policy of preparing for a new war has severely hit the civilian economy, so it not only cannot resolve the economic crisis, but also causes the American economic structure to develop abnormally; at the same time, the result of this policy's attack on the people's living standards has aroused widespread opposition from the people at home.

　　However, the American ruling group still has to and must adhere to its war policy; therefore, as the source of the economic crisis, the United States, through this policy, exports its crisis to other countries in the capitalist world, causing a mess within the capitalist world, and at the same time further prepares the material conditions for the realization of the desire of the people of capitalist countries and the people of the world to have peace and oppose war.

    美国的战争政策
  　静波
    第二次世界大战引起了美国工业生产量的增加，并造成了工业生产力的扩张。制造工业生产指数在一九四三年到达最高峰，即二二八（以一九三七年为一○○）。
    战后，由于中国和东欧许多国家脱离了国际资本主义的体系，由于全世界殖民地、半殖民地民族解放运动的高涨，由于西欧各国遭受了巨大的战争创伤，美国的国外市场大为萎缩。同时，在战后短期内，美国国内人民购买力所赖以维持的战时储蓄，由于垄断资本利润的不断膨大所引起的物价高涨而迅速地消耗，以致美国国内市场也日渐萎缩。所以到一九四六年底，美国的制造工业生产指数下降为一五七，较之一九四三年缩小了百分之三十一。同时期，加工工业的生产则跌落了百分之二十三，耐用商品各生产部门的生产跌落了百分之四十七。
    到了一九四七年，由于美国政府执行所谓“杜鲁门主义”的“冷战”政策，强化了国内的军事生产和对外的军事“援助”，这一年美国制造工业生产指数略有上升，即为一七二。一九四八年，美国制造工业生产指数又在“马歇尔计划”的刺激之下，继续上升为一七五。但到一九四九年，各种经济指数都连续下降，生产减缩，物价下跌，失业人数增加，经济危机的风暴已有来临的征兆。
    这种形势决定了美国统治集团的内外政策方针。这个方针便是在反对苏联、中国及其他人民民主国家，反对世界人民力量，并企图独霸世界的总方向之下，用军事生产来代替民用生产，用军火输出来代替资本和商品的输出，用战争投资来代替普通的投资——这就是美国统治集团对国内实行法西斯化政策，对外实行准备新战争以至最后发动对朝鲜的武装侵略的扩张政策的基础。从经济意义上来看，这就是美国的“失业输出”和“危机输出”的政策。
    一九五○年六月美国武装侵略朝鲜的事件，就是美国在“冷战”政策失败之后所采取的实际战争的行动，其目的在企图遏制美国国内的生产水平的急剧下降，缓和危机，榨取新的高额利润，并从而准备发动第三次世界大战。
    美国侵朝战争开始后的第一个年度（一九五一年度）内通过的军事拨款总数已达六百十亿美元，较上一年增加了两倍，占一九五一年度实际国民收入的百分之三十。根据美国的官方数字，一九五二年度财政预算中美国的军事支出达八百十八亿美元，占该年度估计的实际国民收入的百分之三十六以上。与军事费用激增密切关连的是与军事有关的工业的扩张。朝鲜战争爆发一年来，有关军需工业部门，各机器、汽油、煤、橡胶、化学制造品等工业的生产指数都增加了百分之二十至三十。
    美国经济的加紧军事化，从最近一年来它的对外贸易中也看得出来。美国出口的增加主要是靠输出武器；而入口的增加是靠用作战争生产和战略储藏的军事战略原料的输入。一九五一年上半年的出口，较去年同期增加了百分之四十，全部的增加都是武器的输出。一九五一年财政年度美国国会所通过的对外军事援助法案数字表明，本年美国的武器输出，包括一切方式在内，超过五十亿美元。
    一九五一年前半年美国进口较去年同期增加百分之三十三，进口的增加主要是在于天然橡胶、羊毛、有色金属等进口的增加。进口贸易的这种军事性质，造成了美国的黄金外流现象。为了偿付战略原料的入口，一九五一年上半年美国输出的黄金已达一亿七千八百万美元（去年同期仅七百万元）。
    军事费用的激增，给美国垄断资本集团带来了空前庞大的巨额利润。一九五○年美国公司的总利润达四百十亿美元，比一九四九年增加了百分之四十以上。根据本年第一季的数字（以年率计算），一九五一年的利润总额将达五百十亿美元。
                            ×　×　×
    美国经济军事化一方面养肥了垄断资本家，另一方面却榨干了美国劳动人民的血汗。
    大规模军火武器生产造成了原料及工作母机的缺乏，若干民用工业被迫大规模停工减产。据纽约时报估计，本年第三季轻型汽车的产量较去年第二季减少百分之三十，家用电气设备也减少百分之三十，洗衣机减少百分之五十。消费物品的减少，不仅是由于原料和工作母机的缺乏，同时也因为扩军运动把劳动人民压榨干了，消费力大为降落之故。可见即使民用生产力降低了，也不能减少民用工业制造品滞销的严重性。据七月十一日“华尔街日报”引美商务部数字称，一九五一年五月底，一切工商业存货总值已达六百九十七亿美元，而一九五○年同时期则为五百三十三亿美元。
    扩军运动带来了物价的高涨。今年第二季美国批发价格指数比去年同期上涨了百分之十八，零售价格也猛烈上涨。物价和最低生活费都上涨了，但一般工人的工资增加都赶不上物价的上涨，在个别民用工业部门，如印刷业、皮革工业、衣着工业工人工资的增加远落在物价上涨的幅度之后。
    在物价高涨和实际工资降低的同时，美国参议院最近又通过了五十五亿美元的增税案。根据一九五一年财政年度美国政府预算、侵朝战争爆发后追加军事拨款数字和一九五○年美国人口计算，美国人民每人负担政府一九五一年度支出的五五四美元，估计在一九五二年度将达六五七美元，约合最低工资收入者全年工资的四分之一。美国垄断资本集团就是这样向劳动人民的生活水平疯狂进攻的。
    由于美国政府执行扩军备战政策的结果，美国非军需工业的失业人数正不断增加。许多靴鞋公司、汽车公司、家具公司以及若干其他生产非军需品的工业，已开始将开全工改为开半工，或干脆把工厂关闭，大批工人被解雇。连美国最大的独占资本企业通用汽车公司，也将解雇大批制造民用汽车的工人。
    一年以来，在美国政府扩军备战计划的沉重负担下，美国工人阶级的生活已日益困苦。罢工运动已在全美各地区不同的工业中蓬勃展开，在制钢、汽车、铁路运输等企业中都发生过大规模的罢工。
    同时，尽管美国政府疯狂地迫害美国共产党和进步势力，和平运动依然在全美各地蓬勃展开。全美和平大会于本年六月底在芝加哥开会，有五千名美国人民的代表参加。
    以上就是美国今日的面貌。
    美国政府准备新战争的政策沉重地打击了民用经济，因此它不但不能解除经济危机，反而使美国经济结构走向畸形的发展；同时，这种政策向人民生活水准进攻的结果，又引起了国内人民的广泛的反对。
    但是，美国统治集团仍然而且也不得不坚持它的战争政策；因而，作为经济危机策源地的美国，通过它的这种政策，便将它的危机输出到资本主义世界的其他各国，在资本主义世界内部引起一片紊乱，同时也为资本主义各国人民和世界人民要和平反战争的意愿之实现进一步准备了物质条件。
