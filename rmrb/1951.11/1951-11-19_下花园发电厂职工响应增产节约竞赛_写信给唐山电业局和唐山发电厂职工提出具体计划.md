Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 18th: All employees of the Xiahuayuan Power Plant wrote to all employees of the Tangshan Electric Power Bureau and Tangshan Power Plant, expressing their enthusiastic response to the production increase and thrift competition they proposed. The full text of the letter is as follows:

Dear fellow workers of the Tangshan Electric Power Bureau and Tangshan Power Plant:

Today, with infinite excitement and joy, we read your letter to Chairman Mao. In this letter, you fully represent us, all electrical workers, and our fellow workers across the country, expressing to our great leader our determination and confidence to "go all out to increase production and practice thrift, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers." At the same time, the vows you made to Chairman Mao have brought us infinite encouragement and strength. Dear brothers, in order to realize Chairman Mao's great call, we must advance together with you and our fellow workers across the country, and ensure that we achieve the following in the fourth quarter of this year:

1.  Complete the safe power generation task and ensure that there are no accidents of any responsibility.

2.  On the basis of safe production, shorten maintenance time as much as possible to increase power generation and save the consumption of various raw materials. Ensure that the coal consumption per kilowatt-hour is reduced by 3% compared to the quota, and the plant electricity consumption is reduced by 8%, saving the country 150,000 catties of millet. This will ensure the completion of the Chahar Electric Power Bureau's task of increasing production and practicing thrift by 1.5 million catties of millet in the fourth quarter.

3.  Complete the work of clearing assets and verifying funds at the end of this year to lay the foundation for the comprehensive implementation of economic accounting next year. A production increase and thrift plan for next year should be prepared in December, to accumulate greater wealth for the country.

4.  Continue to strengthen patriotic education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, revise the patriotic pledge every month, and inspect it at least once a week. All employees in the plant should have at least five hours of political and current affairs study every week.

5.  In order to ensure the completion of the task of increasing production and practicing thrift, we must continue to strengthen the in-plant group competition and ensure that 25% of the groups in the plant become model groups by the end of this year, in accordance with the model group award criteria promulgated by the Chahar Provincial Federation of Trade Unions.

Dear brothers, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, let us continuously struggle forward in order to fully support our "most beloved people" – the Chinese People's Volunteers, and to defend our motherland!

With brotherly greetings!

        All Employees of the State-Run Xiahuayuan Power Plant
                            November 18th
