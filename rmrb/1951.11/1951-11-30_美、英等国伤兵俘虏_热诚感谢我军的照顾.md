Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 28th: This reporter reports: American, British, and other captured soldiers in the hospitals of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have expressed their gratitude to our army for its generous treatment and care.

    A captured American sergeant said, "On April 15th of this year, I was suffering from pneumonia. I was immediately sent to the hospital and treated with penicillin and other medicines. Soon, I recovered." He said, "During my hospitalization, I saw that all patients (referring to prisoners of war) received new clothes, blankets, and shoes, as well as daily necessities such as soap, towels, toothpaste, and toothbrushes. Every patient received regularly issued tobacco. The patients' food included pork, beef, chicken, potatoes, carrots, onions, and spices, as well as apples, pears, and candy. All meals were cooked according to our usual way."
    He also praised our doctors and nurses, saying, "Their work is never done; although they work day and night, they still often have smiles on their faces. The only reward the doctors expect is to see the patients recover and leave here healthy." He said, "During this time, I saw many sick companions come here and leave in good health."
    Another American prisoner said, "We drink sweet milk in the morning. Seriously ill people eat six meals a day. After I came to the hospital, I gained more than twenty pounds. The doctors and nurses here saved the lives of many of our friends."
    A private first class who was saved by a Volunteer Army doctor said, "I am very grateful to the Chinese for all the good food and treatment they have given me. My life was once in danger. I thought I was going to die. But the Chinese saved my life." He happily said, "My health is getting better day by day and is almost completely recovered."
    Many prisoners of war also wrote letters to the Volunteer Army expressing their gratitude. A British prisoner of war with an injured ankle wrote, "I had heard before that if I went to the north (referring to the Korean-Chinese side), I would receive good care, but I didn't believe it at the time. But now I deeply feel that it is true, that it is all true. I sincerely thank you for all your care for me. I hope this war can end soon."

    美、英等国伤兵俘虏
    热诚感谢我军的照顾 【新华社平壤二十八日电】本社记者报道：在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军医院中的美、英等国俘虏们，纷纷表示感谢我军对他们的宽待与治疗。
    被俘的一位美国中士说：“今年四月十五日，我患着肺炎。我立即被送进医院，得到盘尼西林等药品的诊治。不久，我便痊愈了。”他说：“在我住院期间，我看到所有病人（指俘虏）都得到新衣服、毯子和鞋子，以及肥皂、毛巾、牙膏、牙刷等日用品。每个病人都得到定期发给的烟草。病人们的食品有猪肉、牛肉、鸡、马铃薯、萝卜、洋葱和香料等，此外还有苹果、梨和糖果。所有膳食都是按照我们习惯的方式烹调的。”
    他又称赞我们的医师和护士说：“他们和她们的工作是做不完的；虽然日夜工作，仍经常带着微笑。医生们所期望的唯一报酬，就是看到病人们病愈后健康地离开这里。”他说：“这期间，我看到许多害病的同伴们来到这里，走时都恢复健康了。”
    另一个美国俘虏说：“我们早上喝甜牛奶。重病的人，每天吃六顿。我到医院之后，胖了二十多磅。此地的医生和护士救了我们许多朋友的性命。”
    被志愿军医师救活的一位上等兵说：“我非常感谢中国人给我的一切良好食物和治疗。我的生命曾经一度发生危险。我以为必定会死去了。但是中国人救了我的性命。”他快乐地说：“我的健康已经一天比一天好起来，快要完全复原了。”
    很多俘虏并写信给志愿军表示谢忱。一个脚踝受伤的英国俘虏写道：“我以前听说过到了北边（指朝中人民方面）将得到好的照料，当时还不相信。但是，现在我已深深感到是真的，那都是事实。我忠诚地感谢你们对我的一切照顾。我希望这个战争能很快结束。”
