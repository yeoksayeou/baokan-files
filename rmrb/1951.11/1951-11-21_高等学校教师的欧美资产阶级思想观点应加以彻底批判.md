    Strive to transform your thinking and become a teacher of the New China!
    Thoroughly Criticize the Bourgeois Ideological Views of European and American Assets Held by University Teachers
    To the Editor: Professors Hua Luogeng of Tsinghua University and Jin Kemu of Peking University have offered criticisms regarding the shortcomings in the work of the two universities. I believe this attitude is correct. Only by unreservedly exposing the various unreasonable phenomena in universities and conducting profound criticisms can university reform be possible.
    Professor Hua Luogeng said: "The consistent pro-American educational style has unconsciously poisoned some people, making them forget their motherland and, even more so, the people of their motherland." This phenomenon not only exists at Tsinghua University, but also in other universities. For example, some professors at the Engineering College of Peking University are unwilling to use Chinese textbooks; a professor in the Architecture Department designed a building plan for the post office: a large circle, with staff desks along the circle, and a small circle inside the large circle, which is the director's office. According to him, this way the director can look around from the office to monitor whether all employees are diligently working. This design fully reflects the teacher's European and American bourgeois thinking. Do our employees have to work under the supervision of the director to do a good job? Furthermore, the specifications and on-site management of the Civil Engineering Department, the textbooks are mostly taken from the textbooks of the United States, Britain and other countries, and there are many anti-scientific and idealistic views in the content. Students raised opinions on this, but the professor said: "This is the accumulation of experience in capitalist countries and the integration of socialism!"
    We believe that teachers should thoroughly criticize the ideological viewpoints of European and American bourgeoisie in their studies, so as to continuously improve themselves and undertake the task of cultivating talents for the construction of New China. Deng Weiqi

    努力改造思想，做新中国的人民教师！
    高等学校教师的欧美资产阶级思想观点应加以彻底批判
    编辑同志：清华大学华罗庚教授和北京大学金克木教授，针对两校工作中的缺点，提出了批评。我认为这种态度是正确的，只有毫无保留地揭发高等学校中的各种不合理现象，并加以深刻的批判，高等学校才有改革的可能。
    华罗庚教授说：“一贯的崇美的教育作风使若干人不自觉地中上了毒素，忘掉了祖国，更忘掉了祖国的人民。”这种现象不仅存在于清华大学，在别的大学里也同样是有的。例如，北京大学工学院有些教授不愿意采用中文教材；建筑系有一位教授为邮局设计了这样一座建筑物的图样：一个大圆圈，沿着圆圈是职员的办公桌，大圆圈内有一个小圆圈，这是局长的办公室。据他说，这样局长便能从办公室外望四周，以监视所有的职员是否勤于工作。这样的设计，充分地反映了这位教师的欧美资产阶级的思想。难道我们的职工必须在局长的监视下才能做好工作吗？又如土木系的规范及现场管理，教材大多取之于美、英等国的教本，在内容上有着许多反科学的唯心观点，同学对此提出了意见，教授却说：“这是资本主义国家累积的经验和社会主义综合的大成！”
    我们认为，教师们应该在学习中对欧美资产阶级的思想观点，加以彻底的批判，这样才能使自己不断地进步，才能担负起培养新中国建设人材的任务。　邓为祁
