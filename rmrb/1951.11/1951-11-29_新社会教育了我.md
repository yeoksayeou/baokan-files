    The New Society Educated Me
  　Hou Baolin
    In the old society, I was an oppressed and despised performer. I started learning opera at the age of thirteen, and continued until I was sixteen. I didn't have money to buy costumes, so I could only use simple stage clothes to sing small operas in Tianqiao, temple fairs, and markets in Beijing, which was difficult to make a living. Therefore, at the age of eighteen, I switched to learning xiangsheng (comedic crosstalk). The grievances I suffered in the years before the liberation of Beijing are endless to recount.
    After the liberation of Beijing, it was the first time I heard people call us literary and art workers, and I was very happy. After studying, I understood that in a new democratic society, everyone should actively serve the people. Like us who sing dagu (storytelling with drum accompaniment) and perform xiangsheng, we must transform our thinking and improve our art in order to serve the people. After we raised our ideological awareness, we automatically stopped performing the old programs that were randomly sarcastic and lacked correct stances and viewpoints. We also tried our best to delete the impure and unhealthy parts of the xiangsheng scripts. The literary and art circles and the audience pointed out the errors and shortcomings in our programs at any time, which educated us and improved our work.
    As the Resist America, Aid Korea movement began, quyi (folk art) and xiangsheng workers actively participated in propaganda work, publicizing the significance of this great movement to the people at gatherings and on the streets. Writers created some new works for us, coupled with what we wrote ourselves, which enabled us to perform new xiangsheng. This March, when I learned that a comfort group was going to Korea, I thought, Resist America, Aid Korea is a great patriotic movement, and everyone should participate. So I signed up. Chairman Mao instructed us literary and art workers to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Now that I have the opportunity to perform for the glorious volunteers, why shouldn't I go? This is my greatest honor.
    After arriving in the Northeast, I encountered bombing for the first time in my life. Not only did I not feel scared, but it deepened my hatred for American imperialism.
    When we arrived in Korea, our quyi service brigade was divided into many small teams. We carried our instruments and props on our backs and performed everywhere. Whether it was on a hillside, in a cave, under a tree, whether it was a large meeting of thousands or hundreds of people, or a small meeting of dozens of people, we performed seriously.
    I personally saw that our volunteer soldiers were very steadfast and hardworking. They said to me: "What does hardship matter! Last winter, we fought in the severe cold of minus forty degrees. The food we sent up was frozen into ice. Sometimes we mixed fried flour with snow water to eat. In the most difficult times, we had to chase the enemy on an empty stomach." Once, the soldiers wrote such a poem: "People's heroes, three days without eating; tighten the belt, capture the American son of a bitch alive."
    Our volunteer soldiers showed their optimistic spirit anytime and anywhere. The caves they lived in were well arranged and orderly. The entrances of the caves were also plastered with couplets that encouraged fighting spirit.
    After watching our performance, the soldiers said to us: "Go back to tell the people of the motherland, thank them for caring about us so much, we will more resolutely strike the enemy." I asked an old Korean woman what she thought of our volunteers. She said: The volunteers are very good, they lived in our house and cleaned it up before leaving, they filled the water tank after using the water, they are good in every way, except for one thing that makes us unhappy: they don't want anything we give them.
    After seeing and hearing these things in Korea, I loved the volunteers even more and urged myself more strictly to learn from the volunteers. During this time, I created the kuaiban (clapper talk) "Flying Tiger Mountain" to praise the heroic deeds of the volunteers and praise their patriotism and internationalism. Comrade Sun Yukui and I collaborated on "Prisoner of War Camp," "Portrait of Truman," and "A Doctor's Story," whose contents are all about exposing the enemy's conspiracies and ugliness. But these creations are not good enough.
    After returning to China, I volunteered to follow the Northwest Sub-Group of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea to Comfort to the Northwest for propaganda, and personally saw how the vast people of the motherland cared for the Chinese and Korean People's Forces. In Lanzhou, there was a blind man who twisted hemp rope, responding to the call of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association, and donated one million yuan—this was the money he had saved for two or thirty years, and he had never been willing to spend it. Now he took it out to donate airplanes and cannons. In Xinjiang, there was an old woman from Henan who lived by weaving mats. After listening to our report, she said that she would weave one more mat and sell it to buy airplanes and cannons. In a few days, the old woman indeed donated 35 yuan of Xinjiang currency.
    Everywhere we went, the local people welcomed us in groups, with gongs and drums. When our plane arrived in Lanzhou, we saw representatives from all walks of life welcoming us as soon as we opened the cabin door. After getting off the plane, we were draped with red silk and put on glory flowers. I asked a welcoming representative: Why are you welcoming us like this? He quickly replied: Because you have been to Korea and comforted the volunteers. I was very touched to hear this. I stayed in the Northwest for a total of three months, and I made more than thirty reports and more than one hundred performances.
    After returning from the Northwest, I was honored to be invited to attend the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Recalling my experience, I felt that: in the old society, no matter how famous you were, you were always an oppressed performer, and you didn't know what you could do, and you didn't know what the significance of your work was; but in the new society, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's correct literary and art policy, we quyi workers have understood the truth of serving the people, and we have become the people's literary and art workers. We have made a little achievement, and the people welcome us so much, what a glorious thing!
    From now on, I will respond to the call of the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on continuing to Resist America, Aid Korea, increase production, and practice strict economy, and I will write new materials in time to perform on stage, publicize Resist America, Aid Korea, criticize those phenomena that waste manpower and resources, I will better unite all quyi and xiangsheng performers, and strive to learn Mao Zedong Thought. I hope that comrades in the quyi circle will work together and move forward in unison!

    新社会教育了我
  　侯宝林
    在旧社会里，我是一个受压迫、受轻视的艺人。十三岁时，开始学戏，学到十六岁。没有钱买行头，只能用一些简单的戏装在北京的天桥、庙会、市场唱小戏，生活很难维持。因此，到了十八岁，改学了相声。北京解放前那些年受的气，说也说不完。
    北京解放以后，我头一回听人家称我们为文艺工作者，我心里非常高兴。经过学习，才懂得了在新民主主义社会里人人都要积极地为人民服务。像我们唱大鼓的、说相声的，就必须改造自己的思想，改进自己的艺术，才能够为人民服务。当我们提高了自己的思想觉悟以后就自动地停止演唱以前那些胡乱讽刺、缺乏正确立场、观点的旧节目了。凡是相声词句里不纯洁、不健康的部分，也尽量加以删除。文艺界和观众随时指出我们的节目中的错误和缺点，使我们受到了教育，工作也得到了改进。
    抗美援朝运动开始了，曲艺、相声工作者积极参加了宣传工作，在集会上、街道上向人民群众宣传这一伟大运动的意义。作家为我们创作了一些新作品，加上我们自己所写的，使我们能够演出新相声。今年三月间，当我知道有一个慰问团要到朝鲜去的时候，我心里想，抗美援朝，是伟大的爱国运动，人人都应参加，因此我就报了名。毛主席指示我们文艺工作者要为工农兵服务，现在能够有机会去为光荣的志愿军表演，我为什么不去呢？这是我最大的光荣。
    到东北后，我生平头一次遇到轰炸，我不但没有害怕的心理，反倒加深了对美帝国主义的仇恨。
    到了朝鲜，我们曲艺服务大队分成好多小队，自己背着乐器道具，到各处去表演。不管是在山坡上、山洞里、树底下，也不管是千八百人的大会，还是几十个人的小会，我们都认真地表演。
    我亲眼看到我们志愿军战士是非常坚定刻苦的，他们对我说：“苦又算得了什么！去年冬天我们在零下四十度的严寒里作战，饭送上来都冻成冰块；有时候用雪水合炒面吃。再艰苦的时候，我们饿着肚子也要追击敌人。”有一回，战士们作了这样的一首诗：“人民英雄汉，三天不吃饭；紧紧裤腰带，活捉美国王八旦。”
    我们的志愿军战士随时随地表现出他们乐观主义的精神。他们住的山洞都布置得很好，很有秩序。洞口还贴着鼓舞斗志的对联。
    看过我们的表演以后，战士对我们说：“回国去告诉祖国人民，谢谢他们这样关心我们，我们要更坚决地打击敌人。”我问一位朝鲜老大娘，对我们志愿军有什么意见，她说：志愿军真好，住了我们的房子，临走时给打扫得干干净净，吃了水临走给挑满缸，他们什么都好，就是一样使我们不高兴：送给他们什么，他们都不要。
    在朝鲜看到和听到这些事情以后，我更加热爱志愿军，更加严格地督促着自己向志愿军学习。在这些时间里，我创作了快板“飞虎山”，歌颂志愿军的英勇事迹，歌颂他们的爱国主义精神和国际主义精神。我和孙玉奎同志合作了“俘虏营”“杜鲁门画像”和“一个医生的故事”，它们的内容都是揭露敌人阴谋和丑态的。但是这些创作都还不够好。
    回国以后，我自愿跟随中国人民赴朝慰问团西北分团到西北去宣传，亲眼看到祖国广大的人民怎样关怀中朝人民部队。在兰州，有个搓麻绳的瞎子，响应抗美援朝总会号召，捐献一百万元——这是他二三十年积攒下来的钱，一直没舍得花，现在拿出来捐献飞机大炮了。在新疆，有一位河南老太太，她靠编席子生活，听了我们的报告，她说要多编一张席子，卖了钱买飞机大炮，没过几天，老太太果然捐了三十五元新疆币。
    我们每到一个地方，当地人民都成群结队、锣鼓喧天地来欢迎我们。我们的飞机到兰州时，一打开机门就看见各界代表来欢迎我们，下了飞机就给我们披上红绸子，戴上光荣花。我问一个欢迎代表：你们干吗这样欢迎我们哪？他很快地回答说：因为你们到过朝鲜，慰问了志愿军。我听了很受感动。在西北一共呆了三个月，我作了三十多次报告，作了一百多次表演。
    从西北回来，我光荣地被邀列席人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议。回想我的经历，我感觉到：过去在旧社会里，不管你怎样出名，始终是一个受压迫的作艺的，自己也不知道能作些什么，不知道自己的工作有什么意义；但是在新社会，在毛主席正确的文艺方针指导下，我们曲艺工作者已经懂得为人民服务的道理，我们已经成为人民的文艺工作者。我们作出一点成绩来，人民就那么欢迎我们，这是多么光荣的事！
    从今以后，我要响应人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议关于继续抗美援朝、增加生产、厉行节约的号召，及时地编写新材料上台表演，宣传抗美援朝，批评那些浪费人力、物力的现象，我要更好地团结所有曲艺相声艺人，努力学习毛泽东思想。希望曲艺界同志们共同努力，齐步前进！
