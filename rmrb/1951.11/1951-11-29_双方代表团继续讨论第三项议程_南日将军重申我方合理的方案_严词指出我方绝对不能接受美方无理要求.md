Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 28th: At the meeting of the delegations of both sides of the Korean armistice negotiations on the 28th, our chief representative, General Nam Il, pointed out that our five-point principle proposal for the third agenda item is a completely sufficient and reasonable solution to the third agenda item. General Nam Il sternly pointed out that the American side's demand, made under the guise of maintaining the balance of military forces between the two sides at the time of signing the armistice agreement, that the Armistice Commission be able to freely enter and exit all parts of Korea, is something that our side absolutely cannot accept. In order to ensure that hostile acts do not recur after the Korean armistice, the fundamental method is not to maintain a balanced state of war, but to fundamentally eliminate this state of war, first by withdrawing all foreign troops, and further starting to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. If all foreign troops are withdrawn from Korea, then there will actually be no question of the balance of military forces between the two sides at the time of the armistice agreement. Therefore, we advocate that once a military armistice is achieved, the governments of the countries concerned should immediately consult on the issue of withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea and other ways to further and thoroughly peacefully resolve the Korean issue.

    双方代表团继续讨论第三项议程
    南日将军重申我方合理的方案
    严词指出我方绝对不能接受美方无理要求
    【新华社开城二十八日电】二十八日的朝鲜停战谈判的双方代表团会议上，我方首席代表南日将军指出：我方对于第三项议程的五项原则建议，是解决第三项议程的完全充分的合理的方案。南日将军严词指出：美方假借维持停战协议签字时双方军事力量平衡之名而提出的停战委员会得以自由出入朝鲜的一切部分的要求，是我方所绝对不能接受的。为了保证朝鲜停战后敌对行为不再复发，根本的方法不是保持平衡的战争状态，而是根本消除这种战争状态，首先是撤退一切外国军队，并进一步着手和平解决朝鲜问题。如果一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，则实际上就不会有双方军事力量停战协议时的平衡的问题。因此我方主张军事停战一旦实现，应即由有关国家政府协商从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队的问题及其他进一步彻底和平解决朝鲜问题的方法。
