　　A Blacksmith Becomes a Valiant Warrior of the Volunteer Army
　　By Our Correspondents Chao Qi and Li Wen
　　On the evening of June 23rd, on the left front of Western Hill, south of Pingkang, a machine gun suppressed enemy fire, providing cover for a unit counterattacking. "Good shooting! Good shooting!" the soldiers praised, as they quickly charged towards the enemy's position.
　　The machine gun was operated by a new soldier - the assistant gunner Li Zongji. Li Zongji, along with the main gunner Zhang Xinquan, killed or wounded more than 40 American soldiers during the day, and effectively covered the unit's counterattack in the evening, earning a first-class merit.
　　This first-class meritorious hero on the Korean battlefield was, just six months ago, an ordinary rural blacksmith.
　　He is from Gaomi County, Shandong Province. His parents died early, and at thirty-two years old, he is still unmarried, living with a blacksmith friend. He makes a living by blacksmithing together with his friend. He works hard and lives with his friend like family, never arguing or quarreling. His friend's younger brother joined the Volunteer Army and went to the front lines, so his family is respected by the villagers and neighbors, and the district head has personally visited to express his condolences. His brother also wrote letters saying how the American bandits were destroying Korea, how much they hated the American army, how they fought several beautiful battles, and how they earned merits. Li Zongji secretly envied them. He thought, "I am young and strong, I should contribute more to the country!"
　　In January of this year, many patriotic youths in Gaomi County volunteered to go to Korea to fight in the war. The Anti-American and Aid-Korea Support Associations in various districts held registration. Li Zongji was very happy to hear this news. Four days before the Lunar New Year, he specially shaved his face, put on new clothes, and enthusiastically went to the district to register. Fearing that he was too old to be accepted, he reported his age as four years younger.
　　The county's grand rally to send off the new soldiers left a deep impression on him. Wearing a big red flower on his chest, he was surrounded by crowds and escorted from his home to the county. There were even more people sending them off in the county, it was even more lively. The county head and the secretary of the CCP County Committee both came and personally poured him wine to congratulate him. He carefully remembered the many encouraging words spoken by the county head, the secretary of the County Party Committee, and representatives from all walks of life. Especially when his sparkling eyes of happiness met the respectful eyes in the crowd, he wanted to stand on the stage and tell everyone: "Folks, rest assured, I will always remember your kindness, I will definitely kill more American devils!" He didn't say it, just stared at the crowd sending them off, his face flushed, smiling excitedly.
　　They traveled by train to the Yalu River. Crossing the Yalu River and stepping into Korean territory, he saw that it was completely different from the motherland that was being built. The further south he went, the more traces of the American bandits' crimes he saw. The villages and towns along the roads were bombed and burned. The disasters of the Korean people stung his heart again and again. More than once he roared angrily: "The American devils are too cruel, even more vicious than the Japanese devils!" He also thought more than once: when the train passed through the vast North China Plain and the banks of the Liao River, he saw the vast, hundreds of miles wide, endless fertile land, the tall buildings of Jinan, Tianjin, Shenyang and other cities, and the large factories with chimneys belching smoke... "The beautiful rivers and mountains of the motherland must not be trampled by American bandits!" He hoped to rush to the front lines as soon as possible to punish those evil American bandits.
　　After arriving at the front lines, Li Zongji was assigned to the machine gun squad of the 5th Platoon of the 6th Company of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army. The squad leader was Zhang Xinquan, an experienced machine gun shooter. The comrades in the company treated him like a relative. The political instructor introduced him in detail to the glorious history of the company and the heroic achievements that the comrades in the company had already created for the motherland; the veteran soldiers told him all kinds of stories about fighting the American soldiers. During meals, the veteran comrades were busy helping him clean up his bowls and chopsticks, telling him to drink more boiled water, and when he slept, they tried their best to keep him warm. Squad leader Zhang Xinquan patiently explained to him the names and functions of the machine gun parts, taught him shooting techniques, and the method of disassembling and repairing the machine gun, even when playing games, he would specially be with him to compete in "pressing the shuttle," a game where you load bullets into the magazine, a competition which aroused his interest in learning. At first, the squad leader always pressed the shuttle faster than him, he was not convinced, and once he finally pressed two more bullets than the squad leader, and they both laughed happily. He gradually fell in love with that machine gun, and whenever he had time, he would take it out to examine it, not letting it get a speck of dust. He skillfully pulled back the bolt, squinted his eyes to look into the muzzle, and then carefully put it back in its original position. Sometimes when he fell asleep late at night, he would still mutter the names of the machine gun parts.
　　The company began to build fortifications, and Li Zongji became a famous tree-felling expert in the whole company. Before others had felled one tree, he had already felled two. The comrades praised him, and he happily stretched out his arms and said, "The Americans won't let me work at the blacksmith's forge in peace, this arm of mine that swings the hammer all day long is now being used for the War to Resist America and Aid Korea." The company was working hard to build fortifications every day, going up the mountain at dawn and down the mountain at dusk, digging all day long. Someone asked him: "Li Zongji, can you handle it?" He replied nonchalantly: "Building fortifications is for fighting well, besides, when I'm busy at home, I'm busy from dawn to midnight, are we working people afraid of labor?"
　　Li Zongji lived happily in the revolutionary big family. He felt that these people, who came from different regions and were united by a great common purpose, loved and cared for each other, and were as close as his blacksmithing partners, as close as brothers.
　　On June 23rd, the company entered the position. After the enemy fired a fierce barrage of artillery, they began a infantry charge.
　　More than a dozen American devils charged towards their 5th Platoon position like a flock of sheep. Li Zongji shouted: "The devils are coming, squad leader, shoot quickly!" Zhang Xinquan stared at the front and said in a low voice: "Old Li, be calm." The American soldiers continued to advance, less than thirty meters from the fortifications. At this time, Zhang Xinquan's machine gun roared, and four devils fell in response. The others crawled and rolled, rolling down the hillside like rabbits. The platoon leader, from the main position, shouted the slogan loudly: "Zhang Xinquan is shooting well, learn from Comrade Zhang Xinquan!" The slogan of commendation quickly spread throughout the platoon. Li Zongji, fearing that Zhang Xinquan would not hear it, told him loudly: "Squad leader, the platoon leader is commending you!" Zhang Xinquan turned around and saw Li Zongji looking at him with envy. He understood the feelings of this soldier and said to Li Zongji: "Do you want to shoot? You can try it." How happy Li Zongji was, the day he had been waiting for so long had arrived. He took the machine gun and swept towards the fleeing enemy. He didn't know what was going on, but the muzzle was shaking violently. Zhang Xinquan said: "Don't panic, Old Li, press the butt tightly against your shoulder, and press down on the gun body." Li Zongji fired a second burst of bullets, the bullets flew close to the ground towards the fleeing enemy.
　　The battle was going fiercely. Zhang Xinquan was wounded and went down. The ammunition handler was killed in action. Li Zongji loaded bullets and fired steadily. The platoon leader came to comfort him, and he said to the platoon leader: "Platoon leader, don't worry, with me, Li Zongji, here, I guarantee that the machine gun will play its role." The enemy's heavy machine gun on the opposite hilltop, due to Li Zongji's temporary interruption of fire (the machine gun malfunctioned), went crazy. The enemy's machine gun shooter, half of his body exposed from the fortifications, was holding a gun and shooting. The enemy shooter's frenzy made Li Zongji feel angry. At this time, the political instructor came, and the political instructor said to him: "Li Zongji, is the machine gun easy to use? I'll help you out." "Political instructor, look!" He picked up the machine gun that had just been repaired, first fired single shots, and then skillfully fired bursts. The bullets ejected from the machine gun quickly pounced on the enemy's fortifications, and the devils shrank into the fortifications in panic, and the heavy machine gun on the opposite hilltop became a dummy.
　　At midnight, the whole company launched a counterattack against the enemy. Li Zongji's task was to suppress the firepower of the machine gun on the opposite hilltop and cover his platoon to occupy the opposite hilltop. When the infantry charged up the hilltop, he held the machine gun and followed closely up the hilltop. He shouted happily: "Comrades, the enemy has been defeated by us, hurry up and capture them alive!" He swept fiercely at the fleeing enemy.
　　When we visited the 6th Company, Li Zongji had already been promoted to the squad leader of the 5th Platoon's machine gun squad. From the outside, he is still dark-skinned, with broad shoulders, and speaks slowly, like a simple farmer; however, he has changed from an ordinary person - an ordinary rural blacksmith, into a heroic fighter with high morale and skilled military techniques.

### 一个铁匠变成了志愿军的勇士

　　一个铁匠变成了志愿军的勇士
    本报记者超祺、力文
    六月二十三日的晚上，平康以南的西方山左前方，有一挺机枪掩护部队反击，紧紧地压制住敌人火力。“打得好！打得好！”战士们一面称赞着，一面飞快地向着敌军阵地冲去。
    使用这挺机枪的是新战士——副射手李宗基。由于李宗基在白天作战中（和正射手张信泉一起）毙伤美军四十余名，晚上，又有力地掩护部队反击，立了一等战功。
    这个朝鲜战场上的一等功臣，六个月前还只是一个普通的农村铁匠。
    他是山东省高密县人，爹妈死得早，今年三十二岁了，仍无家小，寄居在一个铁匠朋友家里，靠着和朋友合伙打铁，来维持生活。他干起活来肯卖力气，和朋友在一起，生活得像一家人一样，从来没闹过气、吵过架。朋友的弟弟参加志愿军到前方去了，因而家中得到乡亲邻居们的尊敬，区长还亲自来慰问过。弟弟也来信说：美国强盗怎样蹧蹋朝鲜，他们怎样愤恨美军，怎样打了几个漂亮仗，怎样立了战功。李宗基暗自羡慕他们，他想：“我正是年轻力壮的时候，应该多为国家出份力！”
    今年一月间，高密县有许多爱国青年志愿赴朝参战，各区抗美援朝支会举办登记。李宗基听到这消息，十分高兴。旧历年节的前四天，他特意刮了脸，穿上新衣服，兴致勃勃地到区上报名。怕年岁太大不被录取，他少报了四岁年龄。
    全县欢送新战士入伍的大会，留给他深刻的印象。他胸前挂着大红花，被人群拥簇着，从家里一直送到县上。县里欢送的人更多，更热闹，县长、中共县委书记都来了，还亲自给他斟酒道贺。他用心地记着县长、县委书记和各界人民代表所讲的许多勉励的话，尤其是当他那闪烁着幸福的眼光，与人群中一个个含着敬意的眼光相接触的时候，他很想站在讲台上告诉大家：“乡亲们，你们放心吧，我永远记着你们的情意，我一定多杀美国鬼子！”他并没有讲出口，只是凝视着欢送的人群，涨红着脸，兴奋地微笑着。
    他们是坐火车到鸭绿江边的。跨过鸭绿江，踏进朝鲜国土，看到那里和正在建设着的祖国完全是两副景象。越往南走，美国强盗的罪迹越多，公路两旁的村庄、城镇，被炸的炸，烧的烧。朝鲜人民的灾难，一次又一次地刺痛了他的心。他不止一次地怒叫着：“美国鬼子太狠心了，比日本鬼子还毒啊！”他也不止一次地想起：当火车穿过冀鲁大平原、辽河两岸时，他看到的那广阔数百里、一望无边的肥沃土地，济南、天津、沈阳等城市的高大楼房，烟囱冒着浓烟的大工厂，……“祖国的锦绣河山，决不能让美国强盗蹧蹋啊！”他盼望着早日赶到前方，惩罚那些万恶的美国强盗。
    李宗基到前方后，被分配在志愿军某部六连五班机枪组，组长叫张信泉，是个有丰富战斗经验的机枪射手。连里同志像接待亲人似地接待着他。指导员向他详细介绍连队的光荣历史，和本连同志已为祖国创造下的英雄业绩；老战士向他讲述着和美国兵作战的各式各样的故事。吃饭的时候，老同志忙着帮他收拾碗筷，嘱咐他多喝开水，睡觉的时候，尽量让他睡得暖一点。组长张信泉耐心地向他讲解机枪的零件名称与性能，教给他射击动作，以及拆卸修理机枪的办法，甚至在游戏的时候，还特意和他在一起，进行“压梭子”比赛，引起他对学习的兴趣。开始组长总比他压得快，他不服气，有一次他终于比组长快压了两粒，两个人都高兴得大笑起来。他渐渐爱上那挺机枪了，有空便拿过它来端详端详，不让它沾上一丝灰尘，他熟练地拉开枪拴，迷缝着眼窥视一下枪口，然后小心地放在原来的位置。有时在深夜睡着的时候，他还叨念着机枪的零件名称。
    连里开始修构工事，李宗基成了全连出名的砍树能手。别人一棵还没砍倒，他已经砍倒两棵了。同志们都称赞他，他高兴地伸着胳膊说：“美国人不让我安心打铁，我这条整天轮铁锤的胳膊，对抗美援朝用上劲了。”连队每天都在艰苦地修构工事，拂晓上山，黄昏下山，一挖一整天。有人问他：“李宗基，你吃得消吗？”他满不以为然地回答：“修构工事是为了打好仗，再说，我在家活忙的时候，也是从天明忙到半夜，咱劳动人民还怕劳动吗？”
    李宗基欢快地生活在革命大家庭里。他感到这些来自不同地区的、以伟大的共同目的而连在一起的人们，相互爱护着、亲近着，像他的铁匠伙伴，像亲兄弟一样。
    六月二十三日，连队进入阵地。敌人发射一阵激烈的排炮后，开始了步兵冲锋。
    十几个美国鬼子，羊群似的向着他们五班阵地冲来。李宗基喊道：“鬼子上来了，组长快打啊！”张信泉两眼注视着前方，低声说：“老李，要沉着气。”美国兵继续前进，离工事不足三十公尺了，这时张信泉的机枪吼叫了，四个鬼子应声栽倒，其余的爬着、滚着，像兔子一样滚下山坡。排长在主阵地上，大声喊口号：“张信泉打得好，向张信泉同志学习！”表扬的口号迅速传遍全排，李宗基唯恐张信泉听不到，高声告诉他：“组长，排长表扬你哩！”张信泉回头看见李宗基正在羡慕地望着他，他理解这个战士的心情，就对李宗基说：“想打枪吗？你来试试看。”李宗基多么高兴啊，好久期待着的一天来到了。他接过机枪，向着溃逃的敌人扫射。不知怎么搞的，枪口在激烈地跳动。张信泉说：“不要慌，老李，用肩膀顶紧枪托，把枪身压住。”李宗基又射出第二梭子弹，子弹贴着地面飞向逃跑的敌人。
    战斗激烈地进行着。张信泉负伤下去了。弹药手牺牲了。李宗基一面压子弹，一面沉着射击。排长来慰问他，他对排长说：“排长放心吧，有我李宗基在，保证机枪发挥作用。”对面山头上敌人的重机枪，由于李宗基一时的中断射击（机枪发生了故障），而疯狂起来，敌人的机枪射手，半身露出工事，端着枪射击。敌人射手的疯狂，使李宗基感到气愤。这时，指导员来了，指导员对他说：“李宗基，使用机枪顺手吗？我来帮你一下。”“指导员你看！”他端起刚修好的机枪，先是单发射击，接着又熟练地连发射击。机枪喷出的子弹，迅速地扑向敌人工事，鬼子惊慌地缩进工事里，对面山头上的重机枪变成哑叭了。
    午夜十二时，全连向敌人进行反击。李宗基的任务是压倒对面山头机枪的火力，掩护本班占领对面山头。当步兵冲上山头的时候，他端着机枪，紧跟着跑上山顶，他高兴地喊着：“同志们，敌人被我们打败了，赶快捉活的啊！”他向着溃逃的敌人猛扫。
    当我们访问六连的时候，李宗基已升任五班机枪组组长了。从外表上看，他依然是黑黝黝脸膛，宽肩膀，说起话来慢腾腾的，像一个质朴的农民；可是，他已从一个平常人——普通的农村铁匠，变成一个斗志高昂、握有熟练军事技术的英勇战士了。
