    (I) The total agricultural output value of the province has exceeded the pre-war level.

    This year's agricultural production in Shanxi Province, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, and after overcoming droughts, hailstorms, frosts and other disasters in some areas, has finally recovered and exceeded the pre-war production level. The total agricultural output value has exceeded the pre-war level by 10%. Among them, the yield per unit area of ​​grain reached 97.9% of the pre-war level, and the total output reached 99% of the pre-war level. The yield per unit area of ​​cotton exceeded the pre-war level by 27.2%, and the total output exceeded the pre-war level by 78.3%. In this year's patriotic production increase movement, a number of high-yield households, high-yield mutual aid teams, and high-yield villages have emerged, and the output of various crops in some counties has greatly increased.
    According to our preliminary incomplete investigation, there are high-yield households for various crops: Wen Guoen of Zhaocheng County produced 715 jin of wheat per mu on watered land; Zhang Kai of Hongdong County produced 529 jin of wheat per mu on dry land; Li Yuncheng of Licheng County produced 1,200 jin of corn per mu on dry land; Shao Shuanghe of Xie County produced 860 jin of stubble millet (i.e. planted after wheat harvest) per mu on watered land; Cheng Yuanding of Qi County produced 840 jin of sorghum per mu; Zhao Zengrong of Jiexiu County produced 1,075 jin of rice per mu; Qu Yaoli of Xie County produced 920 jin of seed cotton per mu on watered land; Shen Kuizi of Zhaocheng County produced 600 jin of seed cotton per mu on dry land; Niu Sihong of Changzhi County produced 204 jin of flax per mu; Li Dayuan of Qingyuan County produced 5,200 jin of grapes per mu. High-yield mutual aid teams include: The average yield per mu of Li Shunda mutual aid team in Pingshun County exceeded 107% of the pre-war level; Qu Yaoli mutual aid team in Xie County had 48 mu of cotton, which reached an average of 549 jin of seed cotton per mu this year on the basis of an average of 258 jin of seed cotton per mu last year; Shao Shuanghe mutual aid team in Yanjia Village, Xie County, had 27.7 mu of watered cotton land, with an average output of 456 jin of seed cotton per mu, more than double the pre-war level; 29.4 mu of dry land cotton, with an average output of 237 jin of seed cotton per mu, more than 244% of the pre-war level; 6.6 mu of wheat, with an average output of 410.5 jin per mu, more than 102% of the pre-war level. On a larger area with high yield: Nanyinbi Village, Hongdong County, a total of 22 households, 120.04 mu of dry land cotton, with an average output of 279 jin of seed cotton per mu, more than double the local general output. In addition, Yuncheng Farm had 672.46 mu of dry land cotton fields, with an average output of 253 jin of seed cotton per mu, and its watered cotton fields had a yield of 1,000 jin per mu; Linfen Special District Farm planted 440 mu of cotton, with an average yield of 452 jin per mu, and its high-yield land reached 716 jin; Yangqu County Farm achieved high yields for various crops: 14 mu of corn, 11 mu of which averaged 997 jin per mu, and the remaining 3 mu averaged 1,353 jin per mu; 8 mu of sorghum, averaging 825 jin per mu; 15 mu of millet, averaging 765 jin per mu; 60 mu of kenaf, except for 30 mu reserved for seeds, 28 mu averaged 150 jin per mu, and the remaining 2 mu averaged 200 jin. The county as a whole achieved higher yields: Licheng County's millet averaged 211 jin per mu, exceeding the pre-war level by 78%; wheat averaged 134 jin per mu, exceeding the pre-war level by 36%; corn averaged 255 jin per mu, exceeding the pre-war level by 75%. Pingshun County's millet averaged 201 jin per mu, exceeding the pre-war level by 48%; wheat averaged 156 jin per mu, exceeding the pre-war level by 30%; corn averaged 287 jin per mu, exceeding the pre-war level by 117%.
    Although these high-yield achievements are still a minority in the province, they provide a goal for continuing the patriotic production increase movement. This spring, many cadres and the masses did not understand the significance of the patriotic production increase movement, and many people were satisfied with the pre-war level. Some said: "People have been old for several generations, and they have only harvested so much grain"; some even believed that "Without the mechanization of agriculture, where else can the output be increased!" Therefore, they do not pay attention to improving technology and tapping the potential of the land. Now these high-yield examples have shattered the conservative views of the empiricists. Some farmers couldn't help but praise when walking by the high-yield land: "Chairman Mao is so good, the people are liberated, and the land is also liberated." Many cadres also concretely recognized from the investigation and summary of high-yield experience that the patriotic production increase movement is the basic driving force for increasing agricultural production.

    (II) Land reform has liberated rural productive forces and the wisdom of farmers.

    High-yield models in various places have not only worked hard to invest in production in the patriotic production increase movement, but also created a series of high-yield experiences in cultivation techniques:

        (1) Autumn plowing and summer plowing are important links to increase yield. High-yield models in various places carry out autumn plowing after the autumn harvest and summer plowing after the summer harvest. The purpose is to make the soil fallow, weathered, increase nutrients, increase temperature, and reduce pests. All high-yield households plow one to two inches deeper than ordinary farmers. Before plowing, generally, they harrow once or several times, or some harrow twice or shallow plow once before deep plowing due to the lack of manpower and animal power for a while. In order to preserve moisture, most of them harrow the land flat after plowing, but some watered land and dry land with a high groundwater level can promote weathering more effectively if they are not harrowed. Not harrowing the wheat stubble land after summer plowing is also to achieve the purpose of weathering and water storage. In short, high-yield models in various places can reasonably carry out autumn plowing and summer plowing according to their own specific conditions such as manpower, animal power, soil, water level, and season. Fan Jun, a high-yield wheat model in Xia County, said: "Plowing the wheat land well is half the harvest," indicating that summer plowing and autumn plowing are very important.

        (2) Spring plowing preserves moisture and ensures full seedlings, which is the main factor in obtaining high yields. Shanxi Province has drought in nine out of ten years, and ensuring full seedlings is a major issue in agricultural production. All high-yield models can grasp the laws of moisture preservation and seedling emergence according to the climate and soil. For example, Li Yuncheng of Licheng harrowed the land twice when the Insects Awaken just thawed, plowed once during the Grain Rain, and harrowed it flat after plowing before sowing. Then he harrowed it twice, so his corn got full seedlings. Gong Manyou of Guo County adopted the method of plowing and harrowing for five days to allow sunlight to shine on the land, increase the ground temperature, and promote seed germination, so his corn emerged early and grew quickly.

        (3) In terms of mid-cultivation (weeding), each high-yield household has a set of reasonable methods. They can determine how much to weed, how deep to weed, how many seedlings to keep, and how to manage according to the different crops and soil differences. They generally pick seedlings two to three times, and their principle for picking seedlings is: "Keep dense seedlings, pick sparse seedlings, and determine seedlings later." Qu Yaoli picked the first time when the cotton seedlings grew two true leaves, the second time when there were four or five true leaves, and determined the seedlings when there were seven or eight true leaves. Their weeding methods are: shallow weeding for seedlings, deep weeding for mature seedlings, and no weeding after flowering. In addition, weeding should be done after drought and rain. Some weeded up to eleven or twelve times, achieving the purpose of loosening the soil to preserve water and fully developing plant roots. Each high-yield household also manages the crops very carefully. For example, cotton is managed using the five-hit method: one is to hit the wood branches (commonly called wandering branches) when the cotton seedlings are set and the flower buds first appear. The second is to hit the top of the main stem to limit growth when the fruit branches are long enough during the summer heat season. The third is to peel off all the strong buds (commonly known as thief teeth) under the leaves of the standing stems and fruit branches to avoid consuming the nutrients of the fruit branches and cotton bolls. The fourth is to hit the tip of the fruit branch before the End of Heat. The fifth is to hit the large leaves from bottom to top during the White Dew season to absorb sunlight and promote peach ripening (but those that can ripen before frost are not hit). In addition, they pay special attention to the spacing between plants and rows of various crops. Cotton is generally around 3,000 plants per mu, Golden Queen corn is generally around 1,200 seedlings, millet is around 30,000 plants... But these numbers are not fixed and should be determined according to the variety and soil fertility.

        (4) Large and reasonable fertilization is the key to obtaining high yields. High-yield households have developed the proverb "If you want good crops, you must be diligent and well-fed." The method of applying fertilizer in stages and centrally is implemented, giving fertilizer according to the soil properties and the needs of crops at various stages. All high-yield households generally apply a certain amount (roughly 2,000 jin to 7,000 or 8,000 jin per mu depending on the fertilizer quality) of base fertilizer before sowing. Cotton seedlings are then top-dressed with manure once before flowering. Some also apply two top-dressings, one after setting the seedlings to promote growth, and one before flowering and setting seeds or when they contain buds to promote fruiting. The top-dressing manure is generally fermented (commonly known as cooked fertilizer). In addition, improving the technology of accumulating and preserving fertilizer is also an important measure to obtain high yields.

        (5) Timely and reasonable watering ensures that crops are neither droughty nor waterlogged. Many high-yield households not only actively transform dry land into paddy fields, but also created some reasonable water application methods. They said: "One person drinks too much water and the stomach swells, and the land grows poorly when too much water is poured." Qu Yaoli's cotton planting method is to not water the seedlings in order to prevent alkali (because the water in the area contains alkali) and squat the seedlings (so that the cotton roots develop downward to seek moisture). Watering starts when there are flower buds and stops when the cotton is spitting fluff. He also adopts the method of frequent and light watering according to the needs of the cotton plants (such as when the leaves turn yellow and droop and the soil surface turns red and white) to give the cotton plants a good growing environment. He said: "Watering depends on the weather, the land, and the cotton." Zhang Qirong of Yuxiang's cotton planting method is to lightly water between the rows when the seedlings are about to emerge from the soil, so that the water seeps into the cotton ridges in order to emerge seedlings neatly (his water does not contain alkali). Zhao Chengwen Guoen's wheat watering is: watering once when the seedlings are about three inches long during the Qingming Festival, watering once when the wheat is pregnant with ears during the Beginning of Summer, and watering once when the ears emerge during the Grain Full. He said: "Watering cannot miss the opportunity. With these three waterings, the wheat grains are big and round." But "it also depends on the weather. Water more when it rains less, and it will be bad if there is too much." In addition, irrigation, top-dressing, and weeding must be carried out in coordination. They generally fertilize and then water, and then weed after watering, which is very reasonable.

        (6) Selecting and breeding fine varieties is the minimum condition for each high-yield household and high-yield group to improve production technology. For example, Li Shunda's Golden Queen corn can harvest 800 to 980 jin per mu in such barren mountainous areas. In addition to improving cultivation techniques, selecting superior varieties is an important condition. All high-yield models attach importance to selecting and breeding fine varieties. For example, Qu Yaoli's S-character four-bi cotton is a foreign superior variety. After ten years of continuous selection and breeding, it has become a superior variety suitable for the local natural environment. According to him, there were very few cotton bolls with five chambers when it first came, but now five-chamber and six-chamber bolls account for 70% to 80%, and seven-chamber and eight-chamber bolls have also appeared. Yangqu County Farm has also produced corn with 1,000 grains per ear. Their method of selecting seeds is generally field selection during harvest and grain selection before sowing. The general standards for selecting seeds are neat plant shape, strong seedlings and large ears (peaches), early maturity, no diseases and insect pests, high yield, high quality, and strong wind resistance.

    (7) Improving the soil is the fundamental way to increase yield. All high-yield households mainly adopted two methods: one is to change sloping land into terraced fields, cutting inside and padding outside to adjust the soil. For example, Guo Yuen's one mu of land in Pingshun County increased its output from 1.2 dou to 2.4 dou after cutting, padding, and adding edges; his mutual aid group improved 57 mu of land by raising high and padding low, achieving high yield for the whole group. The second is to improve alkaline land. Some wash with water; some dig ditches to drain water; some lay sand to cover the alkali and prevent the alkali from rising. Shao Shuanghe, a high-yield model in Xie County, uses sheep manure plus gypsum (6 jin per mu) as fertilizer, and autumn plowing and spring harrowing (no plowing) to limit the rise of alkali gas and obtain high yields. Some also plant alkali-resistant crops.

        (8) Plant diseases and insect pests are major enemies in agricultural production, but they have been defeated by high-yield models. Their methods mainly include three points: one is to prevent them early, such as digging and burning roots, stubble, and weeds, selecting disease- and insect-resistant varieties, and disinfecting seeds; the second is to prepare medicines and equipment early and start removing and treating them early. For example, Zhang Qirong of Yuxiang and Wang Shijie of Hongdong bought sprayers and tobacco and other medicines early and killed aphids as soon as they appeared, so the seedlings were not harmed. Li Shunda's group's corn and millet used copper sulfate to mix seeds, which greatly reduced smut disease. They also used the method of "finding and removing" to ensure a bumper harvest for the whole group; the third is to organize everyone to work together to prevent the spread of diseases and insect pests.

    The above experiences are all interconnected. Especially the more outstanding labor models such as Li Shunda and Qu Yaoli, the reasons for their high yields are all the combination of the above conditions.

    (III) Several issues that should be paid attention to in the 1952 production increase movement.

    Since the province's agricultural production has recovered and exceeded the pre-war level, high-yield models in various places have created a set of high-yield experiences, and cadres and farmers have a specific goal of increasing agricultural production, which has created favorable conditions for the province's production increase movement. In carrying out the 1952 production increase movement, the following issues should also be paid attention to:

        (1) Continue to strengthen the patriotic ideological education of cadres and farmers. Many farmers have learned from their own personal experience that "only in today's society can production be developed well." After two years of efforts, the cotton and wheat yields in Qiujiazhuang Village, Ronghe County, have generally increased, exceeding the pre-war level by 50% and doubling the enemy-puppet era. They said: "The new society has five advantages: first, land reform, farmers have land to cultivate; second, organizing can enable intensive cultivation; third, bandits have disappeared (the village is close to the Yellow River beach, and the bandits in the beach have never stopped for more than ten years before liberation), and vagrants and lazy people have been transformed into good workers; fourth, the counter-revolutionaries have been suppressed, the society is stable, and everyone can concentrate on production; fifth, the government has implemented production incentive policies, everyone is motivated to produce, and labor is glorious." Farmers recognize the loveliness of our great motherland from the improvement of their own lives, and they also look forward to a bright and fulfilling future. Therefore, their enthusiasm for production is constantly improving. However, many farmers do not handle the relationship between individual production and the country well, and some cadres put political struggle and economic construction tasks in opposition to each other. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen their patriotic ideological education so that they can respond to Chairman Mao's call to increase production and practice thrift to support the Chinese People's Volunteers with practical actions in the patriotic production increase movement.

        (2) Further carry out the technical improvement movement. Encourage various crops and various operation reforms, and even small creations or improvements should be rewarded or commended. To this end, the province is prepared to focus on the following three tasks: first, this winter and next spring, we must vigorously complete the technical training tasks of 40,000 village cadres, labor models, and active elements, and conduct professional training as much as possible according to crop categories. In terms of methods, we should attach importance to organizing high-yield models or experienced old farmers to make special reports, focusing on solving the main problems in local production technology. Second, village technology committees must be universally established and improved this winter and next spring. Among the members, we should divide the work according to each person's expertise and the crops in the village (such as cotton, wheat, millet, corn, sorghum, etc.) or operations (such as diseases and insect pests, animal husbandry, forestry, water conservancy, etc.). When convening meetings or conducting training in districts and counties, we should also pay attention to this division of labor in order to cultivate their specialized skills. Within each mutual aid group, we should also pay attention to the division of labor and give play to their strengths. In this way, we can quickly improve technology and also solve the problem of too much work delay due to learning technology. Third, strengthen the work of county farms. In addition to actively helping the farms in each special district to improve their technology, the county people's government should strengthen the leadership of the farms and try to squeeze out some money from the local grain to help construction, so that the farms can play the role of technical departments.

        (3) Leaders at all levels should attach importance to cultivating high-yield banners for various crops in order to create high-yield experience and drive the masses to participate in the production increase movement. According to the experience of many high-yield models, if you want to increase yield, you must implement many conditions related to high yield at the same time. This requires a certain amount of technical knowledge and investment. Therefore, you should first concentrate a certain amount of power and start from the key points. For example, Wang Shijie in Hongdong County obtained high yields for 10 mu of cotton because he had three conditions: "having a seven-inch walking plow, applying 20 jin of fertilized field powder for top-dressing per mu, and selecting the superior variety of S-character cotton." Therefore, in addition to attaching importance to cultivating high-yield banners, in order to widely carry out mass production increase movements, all localities should grasp the key issues in their regions and solve them. For example, the Yuncheng Special District should focus on solving the problems of fertilizer and water conservancy; especially fertilizer, if it can be achieved in two or three years to apply a certain amount of fertilizer to each mu of land every year, it is estimated that the yield can be increased by more than 50% (of course, it is not to say that other conditions are not necessary). Another example is that if Xingxian Special District wants to obtain high yields, the focus should be on changing sloping land into terraced fields. Xigou Village, led by Li Shunda, obtained high yields because it converted 80% of the sloping land into good land. Therefore, each county, village, mutual aid group, and even each farmer should focus on and organize to solve the most important problems in their own production to achieve high yields. Farms at all levels should actively help farmers technically, especially helping high-yield households and high-yield mutual aid groups to formulate specific high-yield plans.

        (4) Organizing village cadres, labor models, and farmers to conduct on-site observation and grasping the evaluation work of the competition is an important experience in leading production in 1951. It should be continued and promoted next year to promote the production increase movement more widely and deeply.

    山西省爱国丰产运动的情况和明年农业生产中的几个问题
    山西省人民政府农业厅副厅长  张　涛
        （一）全省农业生产总值已
    超过战前水平。
    山西省今年的农业生产，在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，在战胜了部分地区的旱、雹、霜等灾害之后，终于恢复和超过了战前生产水平，农业生产总值已超过战前生产水平百分之十。其中粮食单位面积产量达到战前百分之九十七点九，总产量达到战前百分之九十九。棉花单位面积产量超过战前百分之二十七点二，总产量超过战前百分之七十八点三。在今年的爱国丰产运动中，涌现出了一批丰产户、丰产互助组、丰产村，有些县的各种作物的产量都大大地提高了一步。
    根据我们初步调查的不完全的材料，各种作物方面出现的丰产户有：赵城县温国恩的水地小麦每亩产量达七百一十五斤；洪洞县张凯的旱地小麦每亩达五百二十九斤；黎城县李运城的旱地玉米每亩达一千二百斤；解县邵双合的水地回茬谷子（即收麦后种的）每亩达八百六十斤；祁县程元丁的高粱每亩达八百四十斤；介休县赵增荣的水稻每亩达一千零七十五斤；解县曲耀离的水地棉花每亩产籽棉达九百二十斤；赵城县申奎子的旱地棉花每亩达六百斤；长治县牛四红的线麻每亩达二百零四斤；清源县李大元的葡萄每亩达五千二百斤。丰产互助组有：平顺县李顺达互助组每亩平均产量超过战前百分之一百零七；解县曲耀离互助组四十八亩棉花，在去年每亩平均产籽棉二百五十八斤的基础上，今年达到每亩平均五百四十九斤；解县阎家村邵双合互助组水地棉花二十七亩七分，每亩平均产籽棉四百五十六斤，超过战前的一倍；旱地棉花二十九亩四分，每亩平均产籽棉二百三十七斤，超过战前百分之二百四十四；小麦六亩六分，每亩平均产四百一十斤半，超过战前百分之一百零二。在较大面积上丰产的：洪洞县南尹壁村，共二十二户，一百二十亩零四分旱地棉花，每亩平均产籽棉二百七十九斤，超过当地一般产量一倍以上。此外运城农场旱地棉田六百七十二亩四分六厘，每亩平均产籽棉二百五十三斤，他的水地棉田，每亩产量达一千斤；临汾专区农场植棉四百四十亩，每亩平均产量达四百五十二斤，其丰产地达七百一十六斤；阳曲县农场各种作物均获丰产：玉米十四亩，有十一亩，每亩平均产九百九十七斤，其余三亩，每亩平均产一千三百五十三斤；高粱八亩，每亩平均产八百二十五斤；谷子十五亩，每亩平均产七百六十五斤；洋麻六十亩，除三十亩留种外，有二十八亩，每亩平均产一百五十斤，其余二亩平均达二百斤。全县获得较高产量的：黎城县谷子每亩平均达二百一十一斤，超过战前百分之七十八；麦子每亩平均一百三十四斤，超过战前百分之三十六；玉米每亩平均二百五十五斤，超过战前百分之七十五。平顺县谷子每亩平均二百零一斤，超过战前百分之四十八；麦子每亩平均一百五十六斤，超过战前百分之三十；玉米每亩平均二百八十七斤，超过战前百分之一百一十七。
    这些丰产事迹，在全省范围虽然还是少数，但它对继续开展爱国主义丰产运动提供了奋斗目标。今年春天有不少的干部和群众还不了解爱国丰产运动的意义，许多人满足于战前的水平，有的说：“人老几辈啦，也不过打这么多的粮食”；有的甚至认为“没有农业的机械化，产量还能提高到那里去！”因而他们不重视改良技术，发挥土地的潜在能力。现在这些丰产实例已打破了经验主义者的保守观点。有些农民走过丰产地边时，情不自禁地赞美道：“毛主席真好，人解放了，地也解放了。”不少干部也从调查和总结丰产经验中，具体地认识了爱国丰产运动是把农业生产提高一步的基本动力。
        （二）土地改革解放了农村
    生产力，也解放了农民的智慧。
    各地丰产模范，在爱国主义丰产运动中，不仅努力投资于生产，也在耕作技术上创造了一系列的丰产经验：
        （1）秋耕和伏耕是提高产量的重要环节。各地丰产模范秋收后进行秋耕，夏收后进行伏耕，目的是使土壤休闲、风化、增加养份、增高温度、减少虫害。所有的丰产户，均较一般农民深耕一至二寸。在耕翻之前，一般的都是先耙一次或数次，也有因人畜力一时来不及，先耙两次或浅耕一次而后深耕的。为了保墒，多数都在耕后将地耙平，但有些水地和地下水位较高的旱地，不耙更能促进风化。麦茬地伏耕后不耙，也是为了达到风化和蓄水的目的。总之，各地丰产模范都能根据自己人力、畜力、土壤、水位及节令等具体条件，合理地进行了秋耕和伏耕。夏县小麦丰产模范樊浚说：“耕好麦地一半收”，说明伏耕、秋耕十分重要。
        （2）春耕保墒，保证全苗，是获得丰产的主要因素。山西省十年九旱，要求保证全苗是农业生产上的大问题。所有的丰产模范都能根据气候、土壤掌握了保墒捉苗的规律。如黎城李运城在惊蛰节刚解冻时耙地两次，谷雨节犁一次，犁后耙平下种。再耱二次，因此他的玉米获得全苗。崞县弓满有则采取早耕耙五天的办法，让阳光照射土地，增加地温，促进种籽发芽，所以他的玉米出的早，长的快。
        （3）中耕（锄苗）管理方面，每个丰产户均有一套合理办法。他们都能根据作物的不同和土壤的差异而决定锄多锄少、锄深锄浅、留多少苗，以及如何管理。他们在拣苗时一般的都是拣二次至三次，他们拣苗的原则是：“稠留苗，稀拣苗，后定苗”。曲耀离在棉苗长出两个真叶时拣头次，四、五个真叶时拣二次，七、八个真叶时定苗。他们锄苗的办法是：幼苗浅锄，成苗深锄，开花后不锄。此外天旱、雨后都要锄。有锄至十一、二次的，达到了因松土保水，植物根部发育完全的目的。各丰产户对禾苗的管理也很周到，如对棉花是采用五打的办法：一是在棉苗已定，花蕾初现的时候打去木枝（俗叫游条）。二是在中暑节令待果枝长够时打去正顶，限制生长。三是把立秆和果枝的叶子下面生虫的强芽（俗名贼牙）全部剥去，以免消耗果枝和棉铃的养分。四是在处暑前把果枝的尖打去。五是白露节时，由下而上的把大叶打去，以便吸收日光，促桃成熟（但霜前能成熟的不打）。此外他们对各种作物的株、行距特别重视，棉花每亩一般在三千株左右，金皇后玉米一般在一千二百苗左右，谷子在三万株左右……但这些数目也不是固定的，要根据品种和地力来决定。
        （4）大量而合理的施肥，是获得丰产的关键，各丰产户发展了“庄稼要好，手勤肥饱”的农谚。实行了分期集中施肥的办法，按土壤性质和作物各个时期的需要给肥。所有的丰产户一般的都在下种前施了一定数量（按肥质不同大体每亩施二千斤至七八千斤不等）的底肥。棉苗在开花前再施追粪一次。也有施二次追肥的，一次在定苗后促其生长，一次在开花结籽前或含蕾时促其结果。追粪一般的均经发酵（俗称熟肥）。此外他们改进了对积肥和保存肥料技术的改进，也是获得丰产的重要措施。
        （5）及时而合理地浇水，保证作物不旱不涝。许多丰产户不仅积极的变旱地为水田，也创造了一些合理的使水办法。他们说：一人喝水太多肚涨，地浇水太多不长”。曲耀离的植棉办法，是幼苗不浇，便于防碱（因该地水中含碱）和蹲苗（使棉根自己向下发展寻求水份），等到有了花蕾时开始浇水，至吐絮时停止。他又根据棉株的需要（如叶子发黄下垂和地皮发红白时），采取勤浇轻浇的办法，使棉株得到良好的生长环境，他说：“浇水要看天，看地，看棉花”。虞乡张齐荣的植棉办法，则是在幼苗将出土时从行距间轻浇，使水渗到棉垅，以便出苗整齐（他的水中不含碱）。赵城温国恩的小麦浇水是：清明苗长三寸左右时浇一次，立夏麦已孕穗时浇一次，小满出穗时浇一次，他说：“浇水不能错过时机，有了这三水，麦粒又大又圆。”但是“还要看天气，雨多少浇，多了还坏事”。此外，灌溉、施追肥、锄苗等必须配合进行。他们一般的都是施肥后就浇水，浇后就锄，这是十分合理的。
        （6）选育良种是每个丰产户、丰产组改进生产技术的起码条件。如李顺达的金皇后玉米在那样贫瘠的山地，每亩能收到八百斤以至九百八十斤，除了改进耕作技术外，选用优种是一个重要条件。所有的丰产模范都重视选育良种。如曲耀离的斯字四比棉是外来的优种，经过他十年来的连续选育，就使它成为适合当地自然环境的优种。据他说：初来时棉桃五室的很少，现在五室六室的占百分之七、八十，七室八室的也出现了。阳曲县农场也出现了每穗一千粒的玉米。他们选种的办法一般的都是收获时田选，下种前粒选。选种的一般标准都是株形整齐、苗壮穗（桃）大、成熟期早、无病虫害、产量大、质量高、抗风力强等。
    （7）改良土壤是提高产量的根本办法。所有丰产户主要是采取了两种办法：一是改变坡地为梯田，里切外垫以调剂土壤。如平顺县郭玉恩的一亩地经过切、垫、加边后，由一石二斗的产量提高到二石四斗；他的互助组用起高垫低的方法改良了五十七亩地，达到全组丰产。二是改良碱地。有用水洗的；有挖沟壕排水的；有的铺砂盖碱，不让碱上升；解县丰产模范邵双合用羊粪加石膏（每亩六斤）的办法施肥，及秋耕、春耙（不耕）的办法，限制碱气上升，获得了丰产。也有种植耐碱性作物的。
        （8）植物病虫害是农业生产上的大敌，但是被丰产模范战胜了。他们的办法主要有三点：一是及早预防，如刨烧根茬杂草，选用无病虫害或抗病虫害品种及进行种籽消毒等；二是早准备药械和早动手除治，如虞乡张齐荣、洪洞王世杰等，就是早买了喷雾器和烟叶等药剂，在蚜虫刚出现时就把他治死，因而苗未受害。李顺达组的玉米和谷子由于用王铜拌种，黑穗病大为减少，他们又用了“发现就拔除”的办法，保证了全组的丰收年成；三是组织起来齐动手，不使病虫蔓延。
    上述经验，都是彼此互助联系着的。特别是比较突出的劳动模范如李顺达、曲耀离等，他们获得丰产的原因，都是把上述各种条件结合进行的。
        （三）一九五二年的丰产运
    动应注意的几个问题。
    由于全省农业生产已恢复并超过战前水平，各地丰产模范创造了一套丰产经验，干部和农民有了把农业生产提高一步的具体目标，这就给全省丰产运动创造了有利条件。在开展一九五二年的丰产运动中，还应注意以下问题：
        （1）继续加强干部和农民的爱国主义思想教育。许多农民从其亲身体验中，懂得了“只有在今天这个社会里，才能很好发展生产”。荣河县邱家庄村的棉麦产量经过二年的努力普遍提高，超过战前水平百分之五十，超过敌伪时代的一倍，他们说：“新社会有五好：一是土地改革了，农民有地种；二是组织起来，能精耕细作；三是土匪绝迹了
    （该村靠近黄河滩，解放前十余年来滩中的土匪没有断过），二流子、懒汉改造成了好劳动；四是镇压了反革命，社会安定，人人安心生产；五是政府实行了生产奖励政策，人人生产劲头大，劳动光荣”。农民从其本身生活改善中，认识到我们伟大祖国的可爱，也想望着远大的美满前途，因此，生产积极性不断提高。但也有不少农民把个人生产和国家的关系处理得不好，也有一些干部把政治斗争和经济建设任务对立起来。因之必须加强对他们的爱国主义思想教育，使他们能够用爱国主义丰产运动的实际行动，来响应毛主席的增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军的号召。
    （2）进一步开展技术改良运动。提倡各种作物和各种作业上的改革，那怕是很小一点的创造或改进，都应给予奖励或表扬。为此，本省准备抓紧下列三项工作：一是今冬明春要大力完成四万个村干部、劳动模范、积极分子的技术训练任务，并尽可能的按作物分类进行专业训练。在方法上应重视组织丰产模范或有经验的老农作专题报告，着重解决当地生产技术上主要的问题。二是今冬明春必须普遍的建立和健全村技术委员会。在委员中应按每个人的特长和本村的作物（如棉、麦、谷、玉茭、高粱等）或作业（如病虫害、畜牧、林业、水利等）进行分工。在区、县召集会议或进行训练时也应注意这种分工以便培养其专门技术。各互助组内也应注意技术分工，发挥特长。如此既能很快地提高技术，也可解决因学习技术致误工太多的问题。三是加强县农场的工作。除对各专区的农场积极帮助其提高技术外，县人民政府应该加强对农场的领导，应尽量从地方粮内挤出一点钱来帮助建设，使农场能发挥技术部门的作用。
    （3）各级领导应重视培养各种作物的丰产旗帜，以便创造丰产经验带动群众参加丰产运动。根据许多丰产模范的经验，要想提高产量，必须把有关丰产的许多条件同时实施才有可能。这就需要有一定的技术知识和投资，因此，应该先集中一定的力量，从重点做起。如洪洞县王世杰就是因为具备了“有一张七吋步犁，每亩施二十斤肥田粉追肥，选种斯字棉良种”三个条件，十亩棉花均获丰产。因此除重视培养丰产旗帜外，为了广泛开展群众性的丰产运动，各地应抓住本地区的关键问题加以解决。如运城专区应突出地解决肥料和水利问题；特别是肥料，如能在二、三年内做到每亩土地年年施入一定的肥料，估计可提高产量百分之五十以上
    （当然不是说不要其他条件）。又如兴县专区要获得丰产，重点应是改变坡地为梯田。李顺达领导的西沟村，就是由于把百分之八十的坡地改成良田，才获得了丰产的。所以各县、村、互助组至每个农民都应有重点有组织地解决自己生产上最主要的问题，达到丰产。各级农场应该积极的从技术上帮助农民，特别是帮助丰产户、丰产互助组订出具体的丰产计划。
    （4）组织村干部、劳动模范及农民进行实地观摩，抓紧竞赛的评比工作，是一九五一年领导生产的一条重要经验，明年还要继续推广，使之更广泛、更深入地推进丰产运动。
