    Correcting Bureaucratic Work Styles in Production Leadership
    —Starting with the Case of Yang Chunxi, a Fake Model Worker from Jia County
    Yao Zhe

    The name of Yang Chunxi once caused a sensation in Jia County, Henan Province last year, spread throughout the Xuchang Special District, and was repeatedly published in Henan Daily with large-character headlines. He was even listed as a representative to the National Congress of Model Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers last year.

    And now? He has disappeared without a trace! The reason is simple—he was not a model worker recognized by the broad masses, but a fake model appointed by bureaucrats.

    Yang Chunxi is from Houdian Village, Houdian Township, First District of Jia County. His family consists of seven people and owns twenty-two mu of land. He himself was a small merchant who ran a restaurant, with a silver tongue, "able to make one sound like ten," but "good at talking but not at doing" when it came to production. After liberation, he was actively involved in mass movements such as opposing local bullies and land reform, and was once elected as the vice chairman of the township peasants' association. After land reform, Li Fang, the district committee secretary of the district, went to the township to lead production work. Seeing that he was eloquent, he wholeheartedly cultivated him as a model worker. From then on, he bragged about Yang Chunxi everywhere, consciously fabricating and exaggerating his production achievements. Once, at a joint meeting of district committee secretaries convened by the county committee, Li Fang described Yang Chunxi's production achievements in glowing terms, so Yang Chunxi's name left a deep impression in the minds of the county committee.

    In August of last year, the prefectural committee wanted Jia County to send a model worker to attend the National Congress of Model Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers. The county committee immediately decided that Yang Chunxi should attend. Then, it sent Secretary Sun Jingtang, Propaganda Department member Zhang Pu, and Lu Zhoulin of the county committee to Houdian Township to collect and organize Yang Chunxi's production achievements. After Sun Jingtang and others arrived at the township, they found that Yang Chunxi's actions were too far removed from the requirements of a model worker, and they immediately returned to the county to discuss the matter. However, the county committee stubbornly decided that Yang Chunxi had to go. Therefore, Sun Jingtang and others took photographers to Houdian Township for a second time. First, they convened a meeting of township cadres. At the meeting, Yang Chunxi boasted about his production achievements, saying that he had dug a fifteen-foot-deep irrigation well in one night, dug manure pits next to the road, had a new method of collecting fertilizer, planted more than three hundred trees, and picked forty-eight loads of manure with a lantern in one night, etc. The township branch secretary and township head added fuel to the fire and supplemented some of his claims. The next day, Sun Jingtang and others went to his field to look at the crops. They saw that in the low-lying land west of the village, sorghum was planted with millet, called "two-story building," and sesame and corn were planted in the mung bean field, called "three-story building." These crops were growing sparsely and poorly, especially the corn (in addition to other reasons, nothing can grow well if so many crops are planted in one field). When the photographers were taking pictures, the surrounding villagers were sarcastically shouting, "My crops are better than his! Come to my field to take pictures!" But the comrades conducting the field investigation said, "The crops may not be good, but they have a ‘reputation’."

    Yang Chunxi, this "model worker," was thus hyped up from the district to the county, and from the county to the special district! The masses said, "He was blown all the way up to the National Congress of Model Workers!"

    This spring, the county committee designated the township as the county's key production area. The county committee working group made an in-depth investigation in the township and discovered that Yang Chunxi was a fake model worker. His mutual aid team had a total of four households, two of which were bandits and one was a loafer. Yang Chunxi himself was a small merchant who didn't understand production. Since becoming a township cadre, he no longer engaged in production. Most of his twenty-two mu of land was cultivated, weeded, harvested, and reaped by hired labor. The villagers sarcastically said with dissatisfaction, "Yang, the model worker, is cultivated by our whole township!" Indeed, that was the case: Yang Chunxi said he dug a well alone in one night, but it was actually dug with the help of laborers; he dug two manure pits, one of which originally belonged to someone else, and he falsely claimed it; he boasted of planting more than three hundred trees, but he only planted one hundred and thirty-five, and none of them survived. This year, the production increase plan that Yang Chunxi set for challenging labor models such as Li Shunda of Shanxi Province, including the claims of "plowing two and having one remaining," "planting three mu of tobacco," "planting three mu of melon," etc., were all empty promises. And the plan of Yang Chunxi's mutual aid team was originally copied by District Committee Secretary Li Fang from another mutual aid team. The people of the township said with dissatisfaction, "Is this what a labor model is like?" "The newspapers are full of hot air every day, there's no truth!"

    This serious bureaucratic work style of the CCP Jia County Committee has greatly damaged the prestige of the Party and the People's Government. At the prefectural committee's rectification meeting, the county committee made a profound self-criticism on this matter, and District Committee Secretary Li Fang's extremely bad style of "bragging, exaggerating, and being dishonest" was severely criticized. At the same time, more than 30 county and district leading cadres participating in the rectification meeting, through this typical event, universally linked themselves and conducted a review of various work over the past year, especially a review of the bureaucratic tendencies in production leadership, and made analyses and criticisms separately. After this review, all comrades unanimously recognized the harm of the bureaucratic work style and believed that it must be thoroughly corrected, and a realistic and pragmatic work style must be established.

    纠正生产领导中的官僚主义作风
    ——从郏县假劳动模范杨春喜谈起
    姚哲
    杨春喜的名字去年曾一度轰动了河南郏县，传遍了许昌专区，还接二连三地用大字标题登在了河南日报上，更列在去年全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的代表名单上了。
    现在呢？无声无息啦！原因很简单——他不是广大群众公认的模范，而是官僚主义者指派的假模范。
    杨春喜是郏县一区侯店乡侯店村人，全家七口，有地二十二亩。本人是开饭铺的小商人出身，一张好嘴，“一可以说成十”，对生产却是“会说不会做”。解放后在反对恶霸、土地改革等群众运动中，他因为斗争积极，曾一度被选为乡农协会副主席。土地改革后，该区区委书记李芳去该乡领导生产工作，见他会说会道，就一心培养他作劳动模范。从此到处给杨春喜吹嘘，有意识地捏造与夸大他的生产成绩。有一次，李芳在县委召开的区委书记联席会上把杨春喜的生产成绩说得“天花乱坠”，因而杨春喜的名字在县委的头脑中留下了深刻的印象。
    去年八月间，地委要郏县选派一个劳动模范出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议，县委当即决定由杨春喜去出席。接着就派秘书孙景堂、宣传部张朴及县委卢周林到侯店乡搜集与整理杨春喜的生产成绩。孙景堂等到该乡后，发现杨春喜的作为与劳动模范的条件距离太远，当即回县商讨，但县委仍主观地决定非要杨春喜去不可。因此，孙景堂等又带着摄影人员二次到侯店乡去，首先召开了乡干部会。会上，杨春喜把自己的生产成绩吹了一顿，说什么在一个晚上打了一丈五尺深的浇地井，大路旁挖了粪坑，有新的集肥法，栽树三百多株，打着灯笼一晚上拾粪四十八挑子，等等，乡支部书记、乡长又添油加醋地给他补充了一些。次日，孙景堂等又到他地里看庄稼，一看：村西谷地里带高粱，名叫“二棚楼”，绿豆地里带芝麻、玉米，名叫“三棚楼”，这些庄稼长得稀松平常，玉米长得更坏（除去其他种种原因外，一块地里种那样多的庄稼是什么也长不好的）。当摄影时，周围地里的老百姓都在讽刺地喊叫：“我的庄稼比他好呀！到我地里来照吧！”但进行实地调查的同志却说：“庄稼不好可是有个‘名堂’。”
    杨春喜这个“劳动模范”就这样由区到县，由县到专区地吹起来啦！群众说：“一直吹上全国劳模大会了。”
    今春县委确定该乡为县的生产重点。县委工作组到该乡做了一次深入调查，才发现杨春喜是个假模范。他的互助组共四户，两户是土匪，一户是二流子，杨春喜本人是个不懂生产的小商人，自当上了乡干部，便不再从事生产，二十二亩地多是派差代耕、代锄、代收、代割的。全村群众不满地讽刺说：“杨劳模是咱全乡培养的呀！”的确是这样的：杨春喜说他一人一晚上打个井，实际上是民工帮打的；挖粪坑两个，其中有一个原是别人的，他冒名顶替了；他吹嘘栽树三百多株，原来仅栽了一百三十五株，而且一株也没有活。今年杨春喜为向山西李顺达等劳动模范挑战所订的增产计划，其中说的“耕二余一”“种三亩烟”“种三亩瓜”等等都是空头支票。而杨春喜互助组的计划，原是区委书记李芳从别的互助组里搬去的。该乡群众不满意地说：“劳动模范就是这个样呀！”“报纸天天吹，没实话！”
    中共郏县县委的这种严重的官僚主义作风，给党与人民政府的威信以极大的损害。在地委整风会议上，县委对此作了深刻检讨，区委书记李芳的“吹嘘夸大不老实”的极端恶劣的作风也受到严厉的批判。同时，该县参加整风会议的三十余名县、区主要干部，通过这一典型事件，普遍地联系自己，进行了一年来各种工作的检查，特别是生产领导中的官僚主义倾向的检查，分别作了分析和批判。经过这次检讨，全体同志一致认识到官僚主义作风的危害，认为必须予以彻底纠正，并树立起实事求是的工作作风。
