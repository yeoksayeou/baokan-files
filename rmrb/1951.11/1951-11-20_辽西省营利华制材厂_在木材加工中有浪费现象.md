    Liaoxi Province Yinglihua Lumber Mill
    Experiences Waste in Timber Processing

    Editor: I have discovered wastage of timber at the Yinglihua Lumber Mill in Liaoxi Province: (1) Using long timber for short purposes. A certain unit of the Northeast Military Region entrusted the mill with processing small wooden strips of one or two meters in length, which were made by cutting first and second grade Korean pine logs of four and six meters in length. I believe this violates the principle stipulated in the Government Administration Council's "Instructions on Conserving Timber" which "prohibits using large timber for small purposes and using long timber for short purposes." According to the person in charge of the mill, they have already cut 165 cubic meters of four-meter long logs and more than 30 cubic meters of six-meter long logs into such small wooden strips for a certain unit. This disregard for the problem of timber selection and material usage in timber processing is a great waste of timber.

    (2) The mill's timber processing for the Northeast Military Region stipulates an average yield rate of 69%, but only 150 jin of bark can be left per cubic meter of log. This is unreasonable. Because if we carefully weigh the amount of timber and the sawdust lost from sawing, the bark left over from processing each cubic meter of log can reach about 300 jin. We processed 127 cubic meters of the same logs at the mill, reported and sold them based on actual amounts, and the yield rate reached 75%, with more than 150 jin of bark left per cubic meter. In order to prevent excessive losses in the national timber processing yield rate, we have researched and discussed this with the mill, but the mill repeatedly insisted that the yield rate is just this low. Therefore, I suggest that the relevant departments of the Liaoxi Provincial People's Government conduct an inspection of this matter to help the mill improve its ideological understanding and determine a reasonable processing yield rate.

### 辽西省营利华制材厂  在木材加工中有浪费现象

    辽西省营利华制材厂
    在木材加工中有浪费现象
    编辑同志：我在辽西省营利华制材厂发现有浪费木材的情况：（一）长材短用。东北军区某部委托该厂加工一两公尺长短的小木条，是用四公尺和六公尺长的一、二等红松原木截断制成的，我认为这是违反政务院“关于节约木材的指示”中规定的“禁止大材小用、长材短用”的原则的。据该厂负责人谈，他们已为某部截断了四公尺长的原木一百六十五立方公尺和六公尺长的原木三十多立方公尺，加工成这样的小木条。这种不考虑木材加工的取材用料问题，对木材使用是一种很大的浪费。
    （二）该厂给东北军区制材加工，规定平均出材率为百分之六十九，而每立方公尺原木的板皮却只能剩到一百五十市斤。这是不合理的。因为我们把材数和重量再加上锯口锯掉的锯末细秤，每立方公尺原木加工剩下的板皮足可以达到三百市斤左右。我们以同样的原木，在该厂加工一百二十七立方公尺，实报实销，出材率达百分之七十五，每立方公尺剩下的板皮还不止一百五十市斤。为了不使国家木材加工在出材率上损失过大，我们曾和该厂研究商讨，但该厂一再认定出材率就是这样低。因此，我建议辽西省人民政府有关部门对此进行检查，帮助该厂提高思想认识，确定合理的加工出材率。
