　　We Remold Our Thinking
    In Order to Serve the People Well
    Comrade Editor: In the ideological remolding study movement for teachers in universities, I think we must first thoroughly clarify one question: For whom are we studying? Of course, no one is shouting the old tune of "studying for the sake of studying" anymore, but we still often hear things like: "If we don't study hard this time, we will fall behind," "If we don't study, we will be eliminated," and so on. It is true that if we do not earnestly remold ourselves, we will fall behind and be eliminated, which is inevitable. However, we must not use these kinds of words as the basic starting point for our participation in this study. Because this kind of view is one-sided, it will lead us to this answer to the question of "studying for whom": only to avoid falling behind, to avoid being eliminated, for myself! We must not only seek progress in our thinking, so as to gain a foothold in the new society, but also, through this study, closely link our technology, knowledge, and Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, to further and fully develop our strengths and abilities. Our ideological remolding study movement for teachers, like the professional and political studies of the students, is to serve the people and the motherland well, and to gradually realize the highest ideal of mankind—communism! Only by recognizing this can our study this time not fall through, and can we talk about reforming higher education.

　　我们改造思想
    是为了要好好为人民服务
    编辑同志：在高等学校教师的思想改造学习运动中，我认为必须首先彻底弄清楚一个问题：为谁学习？现在固然没有人再喊“为学习而学习”的陈调了，可是我们还常听到：“如果这次不好好学习就要落伍了”“再不学习就要被淘汰了”……一类的话。不错，不认真改造自己就要落伍，就要受到淘汰，这是必然的。但是我们决不能用这类话做我们参加这次学习的基本出发点。因为这样的看法是片面的，它会引导我们对“为谁学习”的问题得出这样一个解答：仅仅为了不落伍，为了不受淘汰，为了我自己！我们不仅要在思想上求进步，从而在新社会里求得立脚之地，我们还要通过这一次学习，把我们的技术、知识和马克思、列宁主义和毛泽东思想密切地联系起来，进一步充分地将我们的所长、所能加以发挥。我们教师的思想改造学习运动，和同学们的业务、政治学习一样，是为了好好为人民，为祖国服务，为了逐步实现人类的最高理想——共产主义！只有认清了这一点，我们这次学习才不会落空，我们才能谈到改革高等教育。
