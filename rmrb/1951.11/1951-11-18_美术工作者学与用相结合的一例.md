An Example of Integrating Learning and Application for Art Workers

Over two hundred teachers and students from the Central Academy of Fine Arts participated in the art work of decorating the venue for the "North China Urban and Rural Material Exchange Exhibition" during the summer vacation and completed the task.

In this work, in order to ensure the quality and efficiency of the work, they all signed patriotic covenants. In order to clearly express the meaning of the exhibition, each piece of material was repeatedly studied and discussed before creation. In two months, they completed 2,055 pieces of work, including comic strips, propaganda posters, sculptures, charts, etc. (some of which were produced by more than 20 teachers and students from the Fine Arts Department of Hebei Normal College), ensuring the timely opening of the conference. Moreover, they donated all the approximately 100 million yuan in royalties from this conference to purchase airplanes and cannons, fully demonstrating the teachers' and students' high patriotic enthusiasm.

Another feature of this work was that teaching was conducted simultaneously with the work, which not only enriched the teaching content but also integrated teaching with practice. In the past, some teachers in schools only taught technical issues such as lines and colors. In this work, both teachers and students have a deeper understanding of the inseparable relationship between artistic creation and politics, policies, and life, which improved their ideological and technical levels of creation. They also specifically learned about the country's rich resources and the people's great creative power from the exhibition. This also led to a deeper understanding of the superiority of the New Democratic system and strengthened patriotic ideas.

The Central Academy of Fine Arts should carefully summarize the experience and gains of this work and implement them into future teaching work. Furthermore, they should frequently participate in social activities in a planned way and participate in the actual life struggles of workers, peasants, and soldiers. This will be of great help to the close integration of art education and politics and to the ideological transformation of teachers and students.

    美术工作者学与用相结合的一例
    中央美术学院师生二百余人在暑假中参加了布置“华北城乡物资交流展览会”会场的美术工作，完成了任务。
    他们在这次工作中，为了保证工作的质量和效率，都订立了爱国公约。为了明确地表达展览会的意义，每个材料都经过反复研究讨论，然后创作。在两个月中完成连环画、宣传画、雕塑、图表等作品二千零五十五件（其中有一部分由河北师范学院美术系师生二十余人参加制作），保证了大会按期开幕。而且将这次大会所给稿费约一亿元全部捐献购买飞机大炮，充分表现了师生们高度爱国热情。
    这次工作中的另一特点是在工作中同时进行教学，既丰富了教学内容；而且也使教学和实际相结合。过去在学校时有些教员只从线条、色彩等技术问题上来教课，在这次工作中教员和学生们都比较深刻地认识到艺术创作和政治、政策、生活不可分离的关系，提高了创作思想水平和技术水平，并且从展览会中具体了解了祖国丰饶的资源和人民的伟大的创造力量；由此也更深刻地认识新民主主义制度的优越性，加强了爱国主义的思想。
    中央美术学院应当很好地总结这次工作的经验和收获，贯彻到今后教学工作当中去。并且经常有计划地参加社会活动，参加工农兵的实际生活斗争中去，对于艺术教育和政治的紧密结合，对于师生进行思想的改造是会有很大帮助的。
