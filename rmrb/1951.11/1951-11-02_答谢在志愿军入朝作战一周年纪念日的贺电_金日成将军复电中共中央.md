To the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Beijing:

I sincerely thank the heroic Chinese Communist Party for the warm congratulations and militant encouragement given to the Korean People's Army and the Korean people on the first anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers entering Korea to fight.

The militant unity of the people of Korea and China has been further consolidated in the course of the fierce struggle against the common enemy of the people of Korea and China – the armed aggressors of American imperialism and their running dogs – and will be further strengthened in the future.

This militant unity between the people of Korea and China, forged with blood, has achieved great success. Undoubtedly, no matter how desperately the American and British imperialists struggle, the final victory of the people of Korea and China is guaranteed.

I wish your Party even more brilliant achievements and victories in the struggle for the prosperity of the People's Republic of China and the happiness of the Chinese people.

Kim Il-sung
Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army
October 30, 1951, Pyongyang, Korea
