Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 27th – At the meeting of the delegations of both sides of the Korean armistice talks held at 11:00 AM (Korean time) on the 27th, the agreement of the sub-committee on the second agenda item was first adopted, as well as the military demarcation line determined by the sub-committee at 10:00 AM on the same day, according to the existing line of contact. According to the agreement adopted by both sides, if the military armistice agreement is signed within thirty days, the already determined military demarcation line will no longer be changed.

Our chief representative, General Nam Il, pointed out: Rapidly reaching an armistice agreement is the goal that our side has consistently strived to achieve. As long as both sides work together, a military armistice agreement can be fully completed within thirty days.

The general location of the military demarcation line agreed upon by both parties is as follows:

Starting from approximately five kilometers south of Goseong on the east coast, passing through Lake Gyeongpo and heading southwest along the Nam River, turning southwest east of Janghang-dong to the south of Mundeung-ri, heading west to Byeonam-dong, north to one kilometer south of Songjeong, heading west across the Bukhan River to Geumseong, south along the Xiahe River to the southwest to Gahyeon-ri, heading west to two kilometers north of Gimhwa, heading west to half a kilometer south of Mokgwan-dong, approximately seven kilometers north of Cheorwon, via Eojeoksan-ri, Gigok-ri, Nabu-ri, Pyeongchon, southwest to Panmun Bridge, heading south along the Sachon River to the mouth of the Imjin River.

After the delegations formally reached an agreement on the second agenda item, they immediately entered into a discussion of the third agenda item, "Specific arrangements for achieving a ceasefire and armistice in Korea, including the composition, powers, and duties of the organization supervising the implementation of the ceasefire and armistice terms."

Our representatives put forward five principles. However, the opposing representatives claimed that, apart from the specific arrangements for a ceasefire, the main issue in the third agenda item was the establishment of a supervisory body, and suggested that neither side should increase military supplies, equipment, or personnel in Korea during the armistice. Therefore, they suggested that the supervisory body and its observer groups should have the right to freely enter and exit all of Korea. Our representatives pointed out that the powers of the supervisory body should be limited to the extent necessary to supervise the implementation of the military armistice terms. The opposing side's proposal to restrict the increase of military forces should be discussed at a higher-level meeting together with issues such as the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea after a military armistice is reached, and it is impossible to find a solution in a meeting aimed at achieving a military armistice.

Both sides agreed to study each other's proposals, and the meeting ended at 3:10 PM, scheduled to continue at 11:00 AM on the 28th.

The principles proposed by our side for the third agenda item are as follows:

(1) All armed forces of both sides, including regular and irregular troops and armed personnel of the army, navy, and air force, should cease all hostile acts from the date of signing the armistice agreement.

(2) All armed forces of both sides should withdraw from the demilitarized zone within three days of signing the armistice agreement.

(3) All armed forces of both sides should withdraw from the other side's rear and coastal islands and sea areas, with the military demarcation line as the boundary, within five days of signing the armistice agreement. If they fail to withdraw after the deadline and have no reason for delaying the withdrawal, the other side has the right to take all necessary actions against such armed personnel in order to maintain order.

(4) All armed forces of both sides shall not enter the demilitarized zone, nor shall they conduct any armed actions in the area.

(5) Both sides shall each appoint an equal number of commissioners to form an armistice commission, jointly responsible for the specific arrangements and supervision of the implementation of the armistice agreement.

    双方代表团会议对第二项议程正式达成协议
    我方对第三项议程提出五项原则建议
    指出监督机构权力应限于监督军事停战条款实施的必需范围内
    【新华社开城二十七日电】二十七日上午十一时（朝鲜时间）举行的朝鲜停战谈判的双方代表团会议，首先通过了小组委员会对于第二项议程的协议，以及小组委员会在同日上午十时按照现有接触线所确定的军事分界线。根据双方所通过的协议，如果在三十天内军事停战协议签字，则已经确定的军事分界线将不再予以变更。
    我方首席代表南日将军指出：迅速达成停战协议是我方一贯努力争取的目标，只要双方共同努力，军事停战协议是完全可以在三十天内完成的。
    双方协议的军事分界线的大体位置如下：
    自东海岸高城以南约五公里处起，穿过鉴湖向西南沿南江而下，在獐项东折向西南达文登里以南处，向西至边岩洞向北至松亭以南一公里处，向西过北汉江至金城南沿小河向西南至佳岘里，向西至金化以北二公里处，向西至牧馆洞南半公里、铁原以北约七公里处，经鱼积山里、基谷里、罗浮里、坪村向西南至板门桥，沿砂川河南下至临津江口。
    代表团会议对于第二项议程正式达成协议后，立即进入了第三项议程“在朝鲜境内实现停火与休战的具体安排，包括监督停火休战条款实施机构的组成、权力与职司”的讨论。
    我方代表提出了五项原则建议。但对方代表声称第三项议程中除了停火的具体安排以外，主要的问题是监督机构的设立，建议双方在停战期间都不得在朝鲜增强军事供应、装备与人员，因而建议监督机构及其观察小组应有权自由出入于全部朝鲜。我方代表指出：监督机构的权力，应该限于为了监督军事停战条款的实施所必需的范围之内。对方所提出的限制增加军事力量的建议，应该在军事停战达成以后在高一级会议中与自朝鲜撤出一切外国军队等问题一并加以讨论，而不可能在一个以达到军事停战为目的的会议中求得解决。
    双方同意各自研究对方提案后，会议于下午三时十分结束，定于二十八日上午十一时继续举行。
    我方提出的第三项议程的原则建议如下：
    （一）双方一切武装力量，包括陆、海、空军的正规与非正规部队武装人员，应自停战协议签字之日起，停止一切敌对行为。
    （二）双方一切武装力量，应于停战协议签字后三天内，自非军事地区撤出。
    （三）双方一切武装力量，应于停战协议签字后五天内，以军事分界线为界自对方的后方和沿海岛屿及海面撤走。如逾期不撤，又无任何延期撤走的理由，则对方为维持治安，对于此类武装人员有权采取一切必要的行动。
    （四）双方一切武装力量均不得进入非军事地区，亦不得对该地区进行任何武装行动。
    （五）双方各指定同等数目的委员，组成停战委员会，共同负责具体安排和监督停战协议的实施。
