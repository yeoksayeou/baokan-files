The statement listed the achievements of the new China in various fields over the past two years, saying that China has "restored and even greatly expanded its collapsed industry, revived the entire economy; eliminated all forms of corruption of officials, who only two years ago were considered to be the most corrupt in the world, and raised the moral standards of the entire people; almost completely eliminated beggars and prostitutes in such a large country; enabled landless peasants to obtain land through the great land reform movement, improved the living standards of the masses, and greatly increased agricultural production." The statement particularly pointed out that China had to import millions of tons of grain from other countries before liberation, but now it has surplus grain for export. The statement praised the improvement of the status of Chinese women and the gradual elimination of unemployment.

The statement described the reform and progress of the new China's judicial system, and also mentioned that the people of the new China have freedom of religious belief.

The statement emphasized that the Chinese people love peace. The statement said: "The new China and its leaders hope to live in peace with any other country in the world."
