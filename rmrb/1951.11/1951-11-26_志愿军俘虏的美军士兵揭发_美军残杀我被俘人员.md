Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 25th -- Otto Bell, an American Second Division soldier captured by the Chinese People's Volunteers, has exposed the American military's crimes of massively slaughtering captured personnel of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies. In a letter written in his own hand and a recorded radio broadcast in which he spoke personally, he said, "Our (referring to the American) soldiers are ordered not to take live prisoners in small numbers, but to kill them." Bell said, "On November 31st, 1950, between Sunchon and Kunuri, I saw 200 Chinese and Korean prisoners brutally killed by South Korean troops. Before I was captured, Chinese and Korean prisoners were kept in barbed wire cages outdoors, during very cold winter weather." Bell also said, "Before I was captured, I saw many inhumane things done by our own soldiers. For example, in one village, our soldiers killed more than 200 innocent people with machine guns and other automatic weapons. This happened on September 29th, 1950."

Bell was a soldier of HS Company, 2nd Battalion, 2nd Division of the U.S. Army. His letter and broadcast recording were written and recorded in a POW camp of the Chinese People's Volunteers in northern Korea before Hanley, Chief of the Military Law Office of the U.S. Eighth Army, made despicable lies. The above letter and recording are for his wife in Olympia, Washington. Bell praised the care provided to them by the Chinese and Korean People's forces in terms of living and medical treatment.

    志愿军俘虏的美军士兵揭发
    美军残杀我被俘人员
   【新华社平壤二十五日电】中国人民志愿军俘虏的美军第二师士兵奥托·贝尔揭发了美军大量残杀朝中人民军队被俘人员的罪行，他在亲笔写的信和亲口讲述的录音广播中说：“我们的（指美军）士兵奉命不要零星收容活的俘虏，而是要把他们杀死。”贝尔说：“一九五○年十一月三十一日，我在顺川和军隅里之间，看到有二百个中国和朝鲜俘虏被南朝鲜军队残酷地杀死。在我被俘之前，中国和朝鲜俘虏都被关在有刺铁丝网的笼子里，放在户外，那时正是天气很冷的冬天。”贝尔还说：“在我被俘之前，我看到我们自己的士兵所作的许多不人道的事情。例如在有一个村庄里，我们的士兵用机关枪和其他的自动火器杀死无辜人民二百多人。这件事发生在一九五○年九月二十九日。”
    贝尔是美军第二师第二战斗营HS连的士兵，他的信和广播录音是在美军第八军军法处处长汉莱发表卑鄙的谎言之前，在朝鲜北部志愿军俘虏营里写出并录音的。上述信件和录音是给他在华盛顿州奥林比亚城的妻子的。贝尔赞誉中朝人民部队在生活上和医药上对他们的照顾。
