How the Anti-Overseer Struggle at the Wanshou Road Construction Site Was Victorious
    Zhang Rongguang
    Cadres of the Beijing Construction Engineering Company's Western Suburb Wanshou Road Works Area resolutely relied on the worker masses to abolish the feudal overseer system. The workers' production enthusiasm was heightened, and the construction project progressed very smoothly.
    The projects in the Wanshou Road Works Area of Beijing are all steel-reinforced concrete structures. There are often more than two thousand workers on site. These workers, in addition to those originally from Beijing, came from Shanghai and from the countryside. Under the control and instigation of feudal overseers, strong regional prejudices existed among the workers. Among the forty-two groups of workers from Shanghai (997 people), thirty-seven groups were recruited by foremen; in these groups, the foremen themselves served as group leaders. The group leaders did not participate in labor but often incited workers to cause trouble for the administration. The earthworkers in Beijing were also ruled by overseers. Some of the workers from the countryside, under the rule of overseers, were exploited and oppressed and dared not speak. Most workers adopted an attitude of working to eat and saying little; workers loafed on the job, and no one cared; the waste of materials was very serious. Although there were thirty-six administrative cadres, two chief technicians, seven formwork carpenters, and eight detailers on site, these technical personnel lacked confidence in doing a good job in construction because the workers' production enthusiasm was not high.

        Without mobilizing the masses, the first anti-overseer attempt failed
    When the construction site began to fight against the overseers, the leading cadres did not grasp the correct approach. Instead of patiently educating the masses, enlightening their consciousness, and letting go to mobilize the masses to carry out a revolutionary struggle to overthrow the feudal overseer system, they first convened a meeting of group leaders and so-called activists. They attempted to announce the anti-overseer policy at this meeting and scare the overseers with a single command. In fact, most of those who attended this meeting were small-time overseers and elements who were exploited by overseers; the few activists, because they were isolated, did not dare to speak out. When the overseers heard that they were going to be opposed, they took the initiative, wooed some of the masses, created incidents, and diverted the masses' hatred away from them. When the administrative side took inventory of the furniture, the overseers seized the opportunity to spread rumors, saying, "The administration has lost a lot of tools, and now they have decided to make the workers pay for them, and they will deduct money immediately," and incited the workers to surround the administration, demanding that they agree not to pay for the lost furniture, making the administration very embarrassed. The arrogance of the overseers became even more fierce. At the same time, the overseers openly threatened the workers, saying, "Whoever dares to report to the trade union, I will fire them first." Some workers who were determined to fight against the overseers did not dare to oppose them under such circumstances. The first anti-overseer struggle failed in this way because the masses were not mobilized.
    After the first anti-overseer attempt failed, some technical and administrative personnel who had not originally supported the anti-overseer struggle said, "Let's not oppose them, it will only be more chaotic, and the project will collapse." However, the administrative leaders and trade union cadres accepted the instructions from higher authorities to "abolish the feudal overseer system and fully mobilize the masses," corrected the mistakes of the past, reorganized their forces, and launched a second struggle against feudal overseers.

        Carrying out propaganda extensively, enlightening the workers' class consciousness
    First, extensive propaganda and education were carried out. The leaders convened group meetings, symposiums, and representative meetings, and used various methods such as cartoons, blackboard newspapers, and big-character posters to expose the crimes of the overseers in light of the workers' actual life experiences. This enlightened the masses' hatred of the overseers and their determination to struggle. The leading cadres also explained the anti-overseer policy to the masses in detail, dispelling the masses' ideological concerns about being unable to overcome personal feelings, being afraid of offending people, being afraid of failing to overthrow the overseers, and being afraid of not finding work if they opposed the overseers. At this time, some activists emerged, boldly reporting the situation to the trade union, and the leading cadres, through these activists, united the broad masses of the middle ground and obtained a lot of material about the activities of the overseers.
    Secondly, the leading cadres cared about the masses' lives, and the administrative leaders solved many practical problems for the workers, such as gradually repairing the workers' quarters to make them not damp and leaky; establishing supply and marketing cooperatives to solve the problem of workers buying things too expensively; and establishing medical clinics to solve the workers' medical and health problems. The workers personally felt that the leading cadres cared about their lives and realized that the trade union was really doing things for the workers, so they gradually united around the trade union and actively participated in the anti-overseer movement.
    When the time was ripe, the most hated overseers, Ai Yufa and Wang Deshui, were first struggled against, suppressing the arrogance of the feudal overseers. Smaller overseers, such as Zhang Tangxin and Chen Jinfang, automatically made self-criticisms in their groups, admitting their past mistakes, expressing their determination to correct them in the future, and guaranteeing to work hard. Chen Jinfang also voluntarily confessed to the trade union that he had made the mistake of inciting workers to surround the trade union cadres.

        Absorbing activists in the anti-overseer movement to establish a trade union
    While publicizing the opposition to feudal overseers, the importance of establishing a trade union was also publicized. In order to expand the mass base, the trade union preparatory committee absorbed activists in the anti-overseer movement. When reviewing and approving trade union members, the overseers were not approved. However, the small and medium-sized overseers were openly told that if they performed well in the anti-overseer struggle, their participation in the trade union could be considered. This gave the overseers another blow, and they dared not talk or act recklessly. At this time, the masses' awareness was raised, further distinguishing between friend and foe; on this basis, trade union committee members were elected, and a formal trade union was established. The activists in the anti-overseer movement were mostly elected as committee members. The new trade union had high prestige among the masses.
    In order to consolidate the achievements of the struggle, a new democratic management system was established. First, construction teams were established, divided into five teams according to the type of work: bricklayers, carpenters, rebar workers, cement workers, and laborers. Group leaders were elected. More than twenty worker cadres were promoted to serve as team leaders, timekeepers, and welfare officers.
    At this time, a workers' representative meeting was convened to discuss production and livelihood issues. The worker representatives put forward more than seventy suggestions at the meeting, most of which were positive suggestions on improving production, saving materials, and strengthening labor protection and safety. This representative meeting concentrated the wisdom of the worker masses and solved many production problems. Many administrative and technical personnel changed their views that construction workers were not highly conscious, only talked about welfare, and did not care about production. In the movement, they clarified the idea of relying on workers to do a good job in production. Because the administrative side adopted the workers' opinions, the workers really felt that they were masters of their own affairs when they saw that making suggestions worked. After the representative meeting, the site democratic management committee was established, and the workers seriously discussed and elected worker representatives, initially implementing democratic management.

        After the victory of the anti-overseer struggle, a new atmosphere appeared in the work area
    After overthrowing the feudal overseers and implementing democratic management, a new atmosphere immediately appeared in the work area. The workers' political consciousness was unprecedentedly raised, and patriotic pledges were universally made or revised. Around National Day, the workers voluntarily participated in security work, constantly patrolling the construction site at night. One night, it was raining heavily, and the workers automatically got up and braved the rain to repair the drainage ditches, so that the newly built walls were not washed away by the water. The warehouse workers shook out the empty cement bags and found 4,500 kilograms of cement. The laborer Liu Maozong discovered a tomb hole under a cement column while carrying earth and reported it to the administrative personnel, avoiding the danger of the house collapsing.
    After the victory of the anti-overseer struggle, the workers' production enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high, and production efficiency was significantly improved. In the past, when tamping lime soil, it was considered finished when it was flattened, and the rammer was only thrown halfway; when carrying earth, only half a basket was carried; now, the lime soil is not considered finished if it is not tamped firmly, the rammer is thrown over the top, and the basket is filled to the brim when carrying earth. The workers said, "Now that there are no overseers, we have truly turned over, and we will never eat raw steamed buns again. Why not work harder?" Rebar workers used to only tie nine columns a day, but now they can tie twenty-four a day. During the National Day celebration, work area director Zhang Zhaofang made a political report and announced the engineering plans for October and November, calling on everyone to do a good job in production to celebrate National Day. The workers responded to this call and launched a production competition. Every day, two hundred people automatically worked overtime in the evening and donated their overtime pay to the volunteers to buy planes and artillery. The nine steel-reinforced concrete buildings were originally scheduled to pour the second layer of cement on October 24, but most of them were completed five days ahead of schedule, and some were completed a week ahead of schedule.

    万寿路工地反把头斗争是怎样胜利的
    张荣光
    北京市建筑工程公司西郊万寿路工区干部，坚决依靠工人群众，废除了封建把头制，工人生产情绪提高，建筑工程进行十分顺利。
    北京市万寿路工区的工程，都是钢骨水泥工程。现场工人经常有两千多。这些工人，除原在北京者外，有从上海来的，有从农村来的。在封建把头统治和挑拨下，工人存在着浓厚的地域观念。上海来的四十二组工人（九百九十七人）中，有三十七组是工头招来的；在这些组中，工头自己当组长。组长不参加劳动，却常常鼓动工人和行政闹麻烦。北京的土工也被把头统治着。农村来的一部分工人，在把头统治下，受剥削，受压迫，不敢说话。大部分工人抱着干活吃饭少说话的态度；工人磨洋工，没有人管；浪费材料的现象非常严重。现场虽有行政干部三十六人，主任技师二人，关砌七人，翻样八人，但因工人生产情绪不高，这些技术人员对搞好建筑工作，也缺乏信心。
        没有发动群众，第一次反
    把头失败了
    该工地开始进行反把头时，领导干部没有掌握正确的方针。他们不是耐心地对群众进行教育，启发群众觉悟，放手发动群众，进行革命斗争，来推翻封建把头制度，而是首先召开小组长和所谓积极分子会议。企图在这个会议上，宣布反把头的方针，一声号令就把把头吓倒。实际上参加这个会议的，大部分是小把头和被把头利用的分子；少数几个积极分子，因为势孤，也不敢出面讲话，把头听说要反他们了，就争取主动，拉拢一部分群众，制造事端，转移群众对他们的仇恨。行政方面清点家具，把头乘机造谣钻空子说：“行政上丢了很多工具，现在决定要工人赔，马上就要扣钱”，并鼓动工人包围行政，要求答应丢了家具不赔钱，弄得行政很作难。把头的气焰却更凶了。同时，把头又公开威胁工人说：“谁敢上工会去报告，我就先开除谁。”一部分决心反把头的工人，在这种情况下，也不敢反了。第一次反把头斗争，因为没有发动群众，就这样失败了。
    第一次反把头失败后，一部分本来不赞成反把头的技术人员和行政人员说：“不要反了吧，一反就更乱，工程也会垮了。”但是，行政领导干部和工会干部接受了上级“废除封建把头制度，必须充分发动群众”的指示，纠正了过去的错误，重新组织了力量，第二次开展了反对封建把头的斗争。
        大张旗鼓地进行宣传，启
    发工人的阶级觉悟
    首先，进行了大张旗鼓的宣传教育。领导方面召开了小组会、座谈会、代表会，并利用漫画、黑板报、大字报等各种方式，结合工人的实际生活经历，揭露了把头的罪恶。这样就启发了群众对把头的仇恨和斗争的决心。领导干部又详细地给群众讲明反把头的政策，解除了群众的打不开情面、怕得罪人、怕反不掉、怕反了把头自己找不到工作等思想顾虑。这时就出现了一些积极分子，大胆地向工会反映情况，领导干部通过这些积极分子，团结了广大的中间群众，并获得许多关于把头的活动材料。
    其次，领导干部关心群众生活，行政领导方面解决了工人群众许多切身利益的问题，如逐步修整工棚，使其不潮不漏；建立供销社，解决了职工买东西太贵的问题；成立了医务所，解决了工人的医药卫生等问题。工人亲身感到领导干部关心他们的生活，认识了工会真是给工人办事，于是逐渐团结到工会的周围，积极地参加了反把头运动。
    在时机成熟之后，首先斗争了工人最痛恨的把头艾育发及王德水，把封建把头的气焰打下去，较小的把头张堂新、陈进发等，自动在小组内作了检讨，承认过去的错误，表示今后一定改正，并保证好好做工。陈进发又自动到工会承认了过去鼓动工人包围工会干部的错误。
        吸收反把头运动中的积极
    分子成立工会
    在宣传反对封建把头的时候，同时也宣传了成立工会的重要。为了扩大群众基础，工会筹备委员会吸收了反把头运动中的积极分子。在吸收审查工会会员时，把头都没有被通过。但公开告诉中小把头，他们在反把头斗争中如果表现得好，可考虑他们参加工会的问题。这又给了把头一个打击，他们更不敢乱说乱动了。这时群众的觉悟提高了，进一步分清了敌我界线；在这个基础上，选举了工会委员，成立了正式工会，反把头运动中的积极分子，大部被选为委员。新的工会，在群众中有很高的威信。
    为了巩固斗争的成绩，建立了新的民主管理制度。首先成立了工程队，按照工种的区别，分为瓦工、木工、铁筋工、洋灰工、杂工等五个中队，选举了小组长。提拔了二十多个工人干部担任中队长、点工员和生活干事等职务。
    这时召开了工人代表会，讨论生产和生活等问题。工人代表在会上提出七十多条意见，绝大部分是关于改进生产、节省材料、加强劳保安全等积极性的建议。这次代表会集中了工人群众的智慧，解决了许多生产问题。很多行政人员技术人员认为建筑工人觉悟程度不高，只讲福利，不管生产的看法都改变了。他们在运动中明确了依靠工人搞好生产的思想。由于行政方面采纳了工人的意见，工人看到提意见顶事，就真正感到自己当家作主了。代表会结束后，紧接着成立了工地民主管理委员会，工人认真地讨论和选举了工人代表，初步实行了民主管理。
        反把头胜利后，工区出现了
        一片新气象
    打垮了封建把头，实行了民主管理以后，工区立即出现了一片新气象，工人政治觉悟空前提高，普遍地订立或修订了爱国公约。国庆节前后，工人自动参加了保卫工作，晚上不断地到工地去巡查。有一天晚上，下着大雨，工人自动起来，冒雨抢修排水沟，使新砌的墙没有被水冲坏。仓库工人把空洋灰袋抖了一遍，就抖出了四千五百公斤洋灰。小工刘茂宗挑土时，发现洋灰柱下有坟洞，报告了行政人员，避免了房屋塌陷的危险。
    反把头斗争胜利后，工人的生产热情空前高涨，生产效率显著提高。过去打灰土，打平了就算，打硪只抛到半腰，挑土只挑半筐；现在灰土不打坚实不算，打硪抛过了顶，挑土时把筐装得满满的。工人说：“现在没有把头了，我们真正翻身了，再也不吃生馒头，为什么不加劲干呢？”铁筋工以前一天只扎九个柱子，现在一天能扎二十四个。庆祝国庆时，工区主任张兆芳作了政治报告，并宣布了十月和十一月的工程计划，号召大家搞好生产，庆祝国庆。工人响应了这个号召，展开了生产竞赛。每天都有二百人自动在晚上加班，将加班费捐献给志愿军购买飞机大炮。九座钢骨水泥结构的楼房，原计划在十月二十四日打好第二层的洋灰，结果大部提前五天完成，有的提前了一个星期。
