Firmly Implement the Marriage Law, Safeguard Women's Rights!
Learn Lessons and Improve Work from the Liang Anshi Murder Case

Editor's Note: The news of the case of Liang Yongshi and his mother murdering Liang Anshi in Sui County, Henan Province, was published on page three of this newspaper on October 7th. The case was delayed for two years due to the irresponsible attitude taken by Zhang Ze, Deputy President of the Shangqiu Branch of the Henan Provincial People's Court, Guo Huanmin, Head of the Judicial Section of Sui County, and Xuan Yuanzunyan, Deputy District Chief of the Fourth District of Sui County (who has now left his post), until a fair judgment was made by the Central-South Branch of the Supreme People's Court in September of this year. Zhang Ze and others have now made self-criticisms. Their self-criticism reports are published below:

Self-Criticism by Zhang Ze, Deputy President of the Shangqiu Branch of the Henan Provincial People's Court

The case of Liang Yongshi and Liang Wangshi abusing and murdering Liang Anshi in Sui County, Henan Province, occurred in August 1949. In September 1951, the Central-South Branch of the Supreme People's Court conducted a trial and exhumed the body to clarify the facts of the case. Finally, a public trial was held locally, and the two criminals, Liang Yongshi and Liang Wangshi, were sentenced to death. I should bear the primary responsibility for the lengthy delay in this case.

I started working at the Shangqiu Branch of the Henan Provincial People's Court at the end of March 1950. In April of the same year, I listened to Comrade Chen Liquan, the former deputy president, describe how Liang Yongshi and his mother had appealed the case. At that time, I believed that the confessions of Liang Yongshi and his mother in the county that they had killed Liang Anshi, as well as their confessions to the masses in the village, were likely coerced. Later, I personally interrogated them and reviewed the case files, and after seeing the record of the injury examination, I became even more convinced that Liang Anshi was likely hanged. Since the Shangqiu Special Commissioner's Office had already submitted the case to a higher level for approval, I put it aside and did not inquire about it. When comrades from the Democratic Women's Federation and other organizations talked about the case, my reply was that the deceased Liang Anshi was not necessarily strangled and stabbed, and I emphasized that the Sui County Judicial Section was "inducing confessions" and "coercing confessions"; I emphasized that An Chongshan was a "litigation trickster" in the past and good at fabricating accusations; I emphasized that Liang Yongshi was an honest farmer, and so on. When I received the approval from higher authorities in July 1950 to sentence Liang Yongshi to death, my thoughts were conflicted. I thought that if Liang Yongshi were a counter-revolutionary, it would be fine to kill him; but since he was a farmer, we should be more cautious, as it would be a loss if we killed the wrong person. Due to my subjective thinking and lack of organization and discipline, I did not discuss it with the leaders of our special district at that time. Instead, I wrote a letter and sent a special person to the Henan Provincial People's Court to present opposing arguments, requesting a reinvestigation. Although I was granted permission by the Henan Provincial People's Court, I did not take a proactive and responsible attitude, organize forces, and quickly clarify the facts of the case. Instead, I treated it as a general case, only allowing the Sui County Judicial Section and several comrades from the Special District Court to conduct two local investigations. The result was still that Liang Anshi was likely hanged. Although I felt at the time that the case was complex and opinions were divided, I always believed that my opinion was correct. At the end of October 1950, I held a meeting at the Henan Provincial People's Court with comrades from the Democratic Women's Federation at all levels and the county and special district courts, but we still did not reach a conclusion. The meeting made a resolution to reinvestigate and then adjourned. During this period, I argued with Vice President Liu of the Henan Provincial People's Court three times, and my attitude was always tough. Vice President Liu advocated sentencing (sentencing Liang Yongshi to death and Liang Wangshi to fifteen years in prison), but I resisted Vice President Liu's opinion on the grounds that "the meeting decided to reinvestigate." After returning to the court, I used rectification as an excuse and still did not reorganize forces to conduct an investigation, delaying it for another month. It was not until December, when higher authorities wrote letters urging sentencing twice in a row, that a formal sentence was pronounced. At this point, the case came to an end. Later, the defendant appealed, and the case was brought to the Henan Provincial People's Court for retrial. Later, it was transferred to the Central-South Branch of the Supreme People's Court for handling.

The two-year delay in the Liang Anshi murder case was mainly due to my low political level and one-sided and subjective thinking. My analysis and understanding of these errors are:

First, a serious bureaucratic style of work. Although I thought the details of the case were suspicious at the time, I did not humbly listen to the opinions of other comrades, nor did I actively organize forces to conduct investigations and research among the masses to clarify the facts of the case, so that the case could be resolved at an early date. Such a major case of abuse and murder was treated as a general criminal case, resulting in a delay of two years. This approach actually stood on the feudal position, supported the feudal forces, and the evil consequence was to encourage the arrogance of the feudal forces and hinder the women's liberation movement, leading to an endless stream of cases of abuse and murder of women.

Second, failure to implement the instructions of higher authorities. After receiving instructions and letters urging sentencing from higher authorities, I did not resolutely implement them. Moreover, during this period, I argued with Vice President Liu three times, insisting on incorrect reasons, such as saying that Comrade Zhang Jianqiu of the Provincial Democratic Women's Federation did not implement the resolutions of the meeting, which led to errors in violating organizational principles.

Third, subjectivism, unwillingness to conduct serious research, and dogmatic belief that it was impossible to have both strangulation and stabbing. Therefore, I became complacent and did not analyze the opinions of others with a humble and calm attitude, but instead acted emotionally and rejected them casually, thinking that Comrade Zhang Jianqiu of the Provincial Democratic Women's Federation and Vice President Liu of the Provincial People's Court were subjective, and I held prejudices against them and had a tough attitude. As a result, unorganized and undisciplined erroneous actions occurred.

The ideological roots of the above errors are:

First, I came from a feudal wealthy peasant family and was influenced by feudal society, so I did not pay enough attention to women being murdered or committing suicide.

Second, arrogance and complacency. I believed that since I started working, I had never made any major mistakes, so I had some complacency and did not take a cautious attitude towards this case.

Third, a rough and careless work style and narrow empiricism. Believing that there was an injury examination report as proof, and that Liang Anshi had certain signs of hanging, I did not consider and analyze in detail the possibility of strangulation and stabbing. I had never heard of strangulation and stabbing before. In particular, the few recanted cases I had dealt with in the past ultimately proved to have some problems, so I believed that Comrade Zhang Jianqiu's publishing of the plaintiff's statement in the newspaper might have helped the plaintiff fabricate false information. I mistakenly believed that Comrade Zhang Jianqiu's spirit of upholding principles was to find reasons for the plaintiff. This is also a concrete manifestation of narrow empiricism.

Fourth, not following the mass line was also one of the reasons for the errors in handling this case. After this case occurred, I only listened to the one-sided opinions of judicial cadres, but did not listen to the opinions and calls of the broad masses, relying on the masses to understand the case, which also proves that my bureaucratic work style is serious.

Based on the above situation, the two-year delay in handling the Liang Anshi murder case was caused by my subjectivism and the one-sidedness of my thinking methods, which supported the feudal forces and hindered the liberation of women. I should bear the primary responsibility for this irreparable loss. I now regret it too late. This incident sounded an alarm for me. In the future, in addition to being determined to liquidate my non-proletarian ideas that harm the revolution, I have sincerely told the Party and higher authorities about the serious errors I have committed this time, and have already requested punishment. I am also publishing the details and errors of my handling of the case in the newspaper as a typical example to educate the masses and educate cadres.

    坚决贯彻婚姻法，保障妇女权利！
    从梁安氏被杀案件中吸取教训改进工作
    编者按：河南省睢县梁永诗母子谋杀梁安氏一案的消息，发表于十月七日本报三版。该案因河南省人民法院商邱分院副院长张泽、睢县司法科科长郭唤民及睢县第四区副区长轩辕尊言（现已离职）采取了不负责任的态度，以致拖了两年之久，直到今年九月才经最高人民法院中南分院作出公正判决。现在张泽等已作了检讨。兹将他们的检讨报告刊登如下：
    河南省人民法院商邱分院副院长张泽的检讨
    河南省睢县梁永诗、梁王氏虐杀梁安氏一案，是在一九四九年八月发生的。一九五一年九月，经最高人民法院中南分院就地审判，开棺验骨，始将该案案情弄清。最后在当地召开公审大会，将梁永诗、梁王氏二犯判处死刑。该案拖延时间如此之长，检查起来，我应负主要责任。
    我在一九五○年三月底到河南省人民法院商邱分院工作。同年四月间，我听取了前副院长陈丽泉同志对梁永诗母子翻案情形的叙述，当时就认为梁永诗母子在县供称杀死梁安氏及在本村向群众坦白都可能是被逼出来的。以后又亲自审讯、阅卷，看了验伤单的记载，印象又深了一层，认为梁安氏吊死的可能性很大。由于商邱专署以前已将此案呈请上级核批，我即搁置不问。民主妇女联合会及其他机关的同志谈及此案时，我的答复是该案死者梁安氏不一定是被勒死和扎死的，并强调说睢县司法科是“诱供”、“逼供”的；强调安崇山过去是“官司油子”，善于捏词控告；强调梁永诗是老实农民，等等。一九五○年七月接到上级批示判处梁永诗死刑时，我的思想发生抵触。认为梁永诗如果是反革命分子，杀了没啥；他既是农民，应再慎重些，杀错了也是损失。由于我有这种主观主义的想法和无组织无纪律的思想，当时未与本专区首长研究，即写信派专人到省人民法院提出反面理由，要求重新调查。后虽得到省人民法院的准许，但我不是以积极负责的态度，组织力量，迅速将此案案情弄清，而是当作一般案件去处理，只让睢县司法科、专区法院的几个同志就地调查了两次。结果仍认为梁安氏吊死的可能性很大。当时虽觉得此案案情复杂，各方意见分歧，但总认为自己的意见是对的。一九五○年十月底在省人民法院开会时，又与各级民主妇女联合会及县、专区法院的同志研究，仍未得出结论，会议作出重新调查的决议后散会。在此期间，我与省人民法院刘副院长前后争执了三次，我的态度均表现强硬。刘副院长主张宣判（判梁永诗以死刑，判梁王氏以十五年徒刑），我以“会议决定重新调查”为理由，抵抗刘副院长的意见。我回法院后，又以整风为藉口，仍未重新组织力量，进行调查，又拖了一个多月。直到十二月间，上级一连二次写信催促宣判，始正式宣判。至此，该案告一段落。后经被告提起上诉，又将此案提至省人民法院重新处理。后又转至最高人民法院中南分院处理。
    梁安氏被杀案拖延二年，主要是由于我的政治水平低，思想方法片面、主观。我对这些错误的分析与认识是：
    一、严重的官僚主义作风。当时对该案的情节既认为可疑，却又不虚心听取其他同志的意见，不积极地组织力量深入群众中进行调查研究，将案情弄清，使案件早日获得解决。对于这样重大的虐杀案件，竟按一般刑事案件处理，以致拖延二年。这种作法实际上是站在封建立场上，支持了封建势力，其恶果是助长了封建势力的气焰，阻止了妇女解放运动，使虐杀妇女的事件层出不穷。
    二、不执行上级指示。在接到上级指令和催促宣判的信件后，均未坚决执行。且在此期间又与刘副院长争执三次，坚持不正确的理由，如说省民主妇女联合会的张剑秋同志不执行会议决议等，以致发生违犯组织原则的错误。
    三、主观主义，不肯认真研究，武断地认为不可能有勒死又扎死的情事。因此故步自封，对别人的意见不是以虚心冷静的态度来分析，而是感情用事，随便拒绝，认为省民主妇女联合会的张剑秋同志和省人民法院刘副院长主观，对他们抱成见，态度强硬。结果发生无组织无纪律的错误行动。
    产生上述错误的思想根源是：
    一、出身于封建的富农家庭，又受了封建社会的薰染，因此对妇女被杀自杀事件重视不够。
    二、骄傲自满。自认为参加工作以来，大的错误从未犯过，因而有些自满情绪，对这一案件未采取谨慎的态度。
    三、粗枝大叶作风和狭隘的经验主义。认为既有验伤单证明，梁安氏又有吊死的某些征象，即不详细考虑与分析勒死又扎死的可能。过去我也从未听说过勒死又扎死的事情。特别是以前处理过的少数翻口供案犯，最后证明多少都有问题，因此就认为张剑秋同志替原告登报，可能助使原告制造假情况。把张剑秋同志坚持原则的精神，错认为是替原告找理。这也是狭隘的经验主义的具体表现。
    四、不走群众路线，也是处理此案中发生错误的原因之一。此案发生后，我只听信司法干部的片面意见，而未听取广大群众的意见与呼声，依靠群众来了解案情，这也证明自己官僚主义的作风是严重的。
    根据以上情况，梁安氏被杀一案拖延二年未作处理，是我的主观主义和思想方法的片面性所造成的，这样就扶持了封建势力，阻止了妇女的解放。这个不可弥补的损失，我应负主要责任。我现在痛悔不及。这件事给我敲了一下警钟。今后我除抱定决心清算自己的非无产阶级的危害革命的思想以外，对此次所犯的严重错误，我已忠诚地告诉了党和上级，并已自请处分。特再将我处理该案的原委和错误，作为典型，登在报上，借以教育群众，教育干部。
