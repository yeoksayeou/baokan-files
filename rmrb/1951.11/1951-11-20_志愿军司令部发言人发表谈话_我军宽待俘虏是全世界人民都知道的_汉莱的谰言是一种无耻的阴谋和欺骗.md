Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 19th: Our front-line reporter recently interviewed the spokesman of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Headquarters regarding Hanley, the Judge Advocate of the Eighth Army of the American Aggressor Forces, fabricating the murder of prisoners by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. He made the following statement:

    Hanley, the Judge Advocate of the Eighth Army of the American Aggressor Forces, issued a statement on November 14th, alleging that the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army murdered prisoners. This is an absurd and utter fabrication.

    As everyone knows, since the Chinese People's Volunteer Army entered Korea to fight, it has consistently and strictly implemented the correct policy regarding prisoners of war, just like the Korean People's Army. Our army's lenient treatment of prisoners has become a model of revolutionary humanitarianism in international warfare. We do not kill or insult enemy officers and soldiers who lay down their weapons and cease resistance, regardless of their nationality or race, nor do we confiscate their personal belongings. We provide treatment to wounded enemy prisoners. In our prisoner camps, enemy prisoners live a comfortable life. In order to cater to the living habits of enemy prisoners, in addition to providing them with the same food as our Volunteer Army soldiers, we also give them extra preferential food such as meat and sugar. Last winter, despite our difficult transportation conditions, we still distributed winter clothing to the prisoners. This summer, the prisoners received excellent summer clothing. At the end of September, when Van Fleet drove his soldiers to carry out the so-called "Autumn Offensive," the enemy soldiers were still wearing summer clothes, while the prisoners in the Volunteer Army prisoner camps were already wearing winter clothes. The prisoners also enjoy a good cultural life. They read, perform plays, play ball, and engage in other legitimate entertainment. In one prisoner camp, the prisoners even held several large-scale ball games.

    Some prisoners were very weak before being captured, and some had already contracted diseases. American prisoners are even more likely to be sick. This is entirely the responsibility of the American aggressors and their accomplice countries' governments. First, the aggressors drove their soldiers to fight in Korea, far from their home countries, which seriously weakened their soldiers' physical strength in the protracted war of aggression, affecting their health. Second, the aggressors, in order to maintain their low morale, encouraged their officers and soldiers to engage in prostitution and debauchery, which seriously damaged the bodies of the aggressor officers and soldiers, causing them to contract incurable diseases. Our army does its best to treat these sick prisoners. However, some of the prisoners could not be saved because their bodies were too damaged and their conditions were too severe. This is entirely the responsibility of the American aggressors and their vassal countries' governments.

    This revolutionary humanitarian prisoner policy and lenient treatment of prisoners by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are known to people all over the world. The American people and the soldiers of the American and accomplice armies on the Korean battlefield also know this. The shameless lies of Hanley, the Judge Advocate of the Eighth Army of the American Aggressor Forces, who slandered the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army for killing the prisoners, are not worth refuting. He said that the head of the 23rd Regiment of the 81st Division of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army ordered the execution of captured U.S. Marine Corps personnel, but our Volunteer Army does not have this unit designation at all. The enemy's issuance of these shameless lies is closely related to the U.S.'s deliberate delays and obstruction of the armistice negotiations. The enemy also wants to use this to deceive increasingly war-weary aggressor soldiers, so that they continue to die for the Wall Street war profiteers.

    Our army treats enemy prisoners with revolutionary humanitarianism, while the American aggressors themselves are the ones who truly kill American prisoners. From February to the present, American aircraft have repeatedly bombed and strafed our prisoner camps located in the rear of northern Korea, which have no military targets. The first time was at 2:30 pm on February 19th, the second time was on March 17th, the third time was on April 2nd, the fourth time was at 1:00 pm on April 22nd, and the most recent time was at 10:00 pm on October 13th. In these five air raids, American aircraft bombed and wounded many American and accomplice army prisoners. This inhumane behavior of the American aggressors has aroused extreme indignation among all prisoners in the prisoner camps.

    Contrary to the lies fabricated by the U.S., it is the bloodthirsty American war profiteers who are slaughtering and abusing the other side's prisoners. The captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and our Chinese People's Volunteer Army have been repeatedly subjected to brutal slaughter and barbaric abuse by the U.S. military. This August, American and British aggressors used a British ship to transport 1,000 prisoners of war from Korea, Vietnam, and other countries to the West for atomic explosion experiments. The American and British aggressors should bear full responsibility for this inhumane crime. (Attached picture)

### 志愿军司令部发言人发表谈话  我军宽待俘虏是全世界人民都知道的  汉莱的谰言是一种无耻的阴谋和欺骗

    志愿军司令部发言人发表谈话
    我军宽待俘虏是全世界人民都知道的
    汉莱的谰言是一种无耻的阴谋和欺骗
    【新华社朝鲜前线十九日电】本社前线记者顷就美国侵略军第八军军法处处长汉莱捏造朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军杀害俘虏一事，走访中国人民志愿军司令部发言人，承其发表谈话如下：
    十一月十四日，美国侵略军第八军军法处处长汉莱发表的所谓朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军杀害俘虏的声明，是荒谬的彻头彻尾的造谣。
    众所周知，我国人民志愿军自入朝作战以来，与朝鲜人民军一样，一贯严格地执行正确的俘虏政策。我军宽待俘虏的行动，已成为国际战争中以革命人道主义对待敌方俘虏的典范。我军对放下武器、停止抵抗的敌军官兵，不分国籍、人种，都不杀不辱，不没收其私人财物；对受伤的敌军俘虏，都予以治疗。在我俘虏营中，敌军俘虏都过着安乐的生活。我军为了照顾敌军俘虏的生活习惯，除给他们与我志愿军战士同样的食物供给外，还给他们肉类、糖类等额外优待的食品。去年冬季在我们运输条件困难的情况下，我们仍然发给俘虏冬衣。今年夏天，俘虏又都领到了很好的夏衣。在九月底，当范佛里特驱使其士兵进行所谓“秋季攻势”时，敌人的士兵还穿着夏衣，而在志愿军俘虏营里的俘虏们，却已经穿上了冬衣。俘虏们并且过着良好的文化生活。他们读书、演剧、打球和作其它各种正当的娱乐，在某一个俘虏营中，俘虏们还举行了几次大规模的球赛。
    有一部分俘虏的身体，在被俘之前是十分衰弱的，有的已经染上疾病。美军俘虏患病的更多。这完全要由美国侵略者及其帮凶国的政府负责。因为第一，侵略者驱使其士兵到远离本国的朝鲜作战，使他们士兵在旷日持久的侵略战争中，严重地削弱了体力，以致影响了健康。第二、侵略者为了维持其低落的士气、怂恿其官兵嫖妓、纵欲，这也严重地摧残了侵略军官兵们的身体，使他们染上了难以医治的痼疾。我军对这些染病的俘虏，都尽力予以医治。但其中有的俘虏因为其身体损伤过甚，病情严重，而不能挽救，这完全应由美国侵略者及其仆从国的政府负责。
    中国人民志愿军的这种革命人道主义的俘虏政策和宽待俘虏的实际行动，是全世界人民都知道的。美国人民和在朝鲜战场上的美军及其帮凶军的士兵们也都知道。美军第八军军法处处长汉莱诽谤朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军杀害俘虏的无耻谰言，本是不值一驳的。他说中国人民志愿军第八十一师第二十三团团长曾下令处决美军海军陆战队被俘人员，其实我志愿军根本就无此部队番号。敌人发出这些无耻谰言，与美方蓄意拖延和阻挠停战谈判的行动有密切联系。敌人并想以此欺骗日益厌战的侵略军士兵，使他们继续为华尔街的战争贩子们送命。
    我军处处以革命人道主义的精神，宽待敌军俘虏，而真正杀害美军俘虏的，倒是美国侵略者自己。从今年二月间到现在，美国飞机曾迭次轰炸扫射处在朝鲜北部后方的毫无军事目标的我军俘虏营。第一次在二月十九日下午二时三十分，第二次在三月十七日，第三次在四月二日，第四次在四月二十二日下午一时，最近一次是在十月十三日晚十时。在这五次空袭中，美国飞机炸死炸伤了许多美军和帮凶军的俘虏。美国侵略者这种惨无人道的行为，曾引起俘虏营里所有俘虏的极度愤慨。
    与美方捏造的谎言相反，屠杀、虐待对方俘虏的正是嗜血成性的美国战争贩子们。朝鲜人民军和我国人民志愿军的被俘人员，曾屡次遭到美军残酷的屠杀和野蛮的虐待。今年八月间，美、英侵略者用一艘英国轮船运送了一千名朝鲜、越南等国的战俘，到西方去作原子爆炸的试验。美、英侵略者应对这种灭绝人性的罪行负完全的责任。（附图片）
