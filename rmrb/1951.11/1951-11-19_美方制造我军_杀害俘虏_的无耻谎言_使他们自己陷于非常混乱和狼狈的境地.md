Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The American aggressors are placing themselves in a very chaotic and embarrassing situation by fabricating the shameless lie about the Chinese and Korean People's Army "killing prisoners of war."

Originally, the reason why the American aggressors lied this time contained ulterior and despicable motives. According to a France-Presse dispatch from Paris on the 15th: Korean armistice negotiations "seem to only need to formally draft an armistice treaty. At this moment,... news of the communist massacre of UN prisoner of wars suddenly leaked out.” An Associated Press dispatch from Busan on the 14th said: "This statement was issued in a strange way, precisely when the entire prisoner of war issue, which is prone to excitement, was attracting attention at the Panmunjom truce talks." An Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 15th more bluntly stated that the US side did this because it "believes that it will positively support Ridgway and his representatives sent to Panmunjom." Agence France-Presse also said that observers in Paris believed that the "moderate public opinion" of countries following the United States in opposing the delaying policy might be "washed aside" by the "wave of anger" that the United States attempted to create this time. Hanley, the head of the US Eighth Army's Judge Advocate's Office who directly spread this lie, also openly admitted that one of the purposes of doing so was to prevent American soldiers from believing in the Chinese and Korean People's Army's policy of treating prisoners of war leniently, and not to believe the fact that "if captured, they will enjoy preferential treatment," in order to drive them to continue fighting.

However, even British officials did not believe the lies fabricated by the American aggressors. An Associated Press dispatch from London on the 16th said: A British "Foreign Office spokesman told reporters today that Britain has not received formal information about the alleged atrocities, and Defense Ministry officials said that the British government has not received any information from intelligence sources." Moreover, "some government officials say they can be quite sure that if the Communists had been carrying out a continuous massacre plan, the world would have known about it before. ... Other officials are also somewhat skeptical about the news of this massacre."

The American liars who orchestrated this lying conspiracy were guilty and evasive from the beginning. After Hanley was ordered to spread that despicable and shameless lie on the 14th, Ridgway pretended to be "unaware" while sending people to "investigate" the matter. Ridgway also issued a statement on the 17th, expressing "great regret" over Hanley's "hasty publication" of this statement. The U.S. Department of Defense also hastily shirked responsibility. It issued a communique on the evening of the 14th, stating that "the report was not consulted with officials here before its publication." Frederick, the head of the U.S. Department of Defense's news office, also hurriedly said on the 17th: The U.S. Department of Defense "has not received any information that can confirm this claim (referring to Hanley's lie)."

The big American liars attempted to make Hanley a scapegoat, but Hanley confessed to the actual situation. According to United Press International and Associated Press reports, Hanley admitted: "Of course, I received the approval of senior officials before publishing this news." Hanley said that the instructions to publish fabricated lies "were issued by the headquarters staff through normal channels, and he himself followed these instructions." He also said: "I published the figures after obtaining permission from the headquarters news office."

Now, the American liars seem to feel that things have developed very unfavorably for them. According to a dispatch from International News Service in Tokyo on the 18th, the U.S. "Army today does not allow Hanley to meet with reporters. Hanley may still be in Tokyo, but reporters tried hard to meet him today, but were unable to do so due to the Army's obstruction." The American liars probably thought that this would prevent their conspiracy from being revealed. However, the magic trick was not prevented from being exposed because of this. In fact, everyone sees that Hanley is just a mouthpiece, and behind him are the big American liars in Tokyo and Washington. The so-called Chinese and Korean People's Army "massacring prisoners of war" is completely a shameless lie of the American aggressors.

    美方制造我军“杀害俘虏”的无耻谎言
    使他们自己陷于非常混乱和狼狈的境地
    【新华社十八日讯】美国侵略者在制造所谓中朝人民军队“杀害俘虏”的无耻谎言中，正使自己陷于非常混乱和狼狈的境地。
    本来，这次美国侵略者之所以撒谎，包含着不可告人的卑鄙阴谋。据法新社巴黎十五日电说：朝鲜停战谈判“看来只须正式草拟停战条约就可以了。就在这个时候，……共产党屠杀联合国军战俘的消息突然透露出来了”。美联社釜山十四日电说：“这个声明，是正当那个容易引起激动的整个战俘问题在板门店休战谈判中受人注意的时候，以奇怪的方式发表的。”美联社东京十五日电更露骨地说，美方这样做，“相信是会使得舆论界正面支持李奇微和他派到板门店的代表们的”。法新社并且说，巴黎的观察家认为：追随美国的国家反对拖延政策的“和缓舆论”，可能被美国这次所企图制造的“愤怒的浪潮”“冲到旁边去”。直接散布这个谎言的美国第八军军法处处长汉莱也公开承认：这样做的目的之一，是要叫美国士兵不要相信中朝人民军队宽待俘虏的政策，不要相信“如果被俘，就会享受优待”的事实，以便驱使他们继续作战。
    但是美国侵略者所捏造的谎言，连英国官方都不相信。美联社伦敦十六日电说：英国“外交部发言人今天告记者说，关于所说的暴行，英国还没有得到正式的情报，又据国防部官员说，英国政府也没有从谍报方面得到任何消息”。而且，“一部分政府官员说，他们可以十分肯定，假若共军曾经不断进行屠杀的计划，全世界在这以前就会已经知道了。……其他官员也有点怀疑这种屠杀的消息”。
    布置这次撒谎阴谋的美国骗子们，做贼心虚，一开始就躲躲闪闪。当汉莱在十四日奉命散布了那个卑鄙无耻的谎言以后，李奇微假装“毫无所知”，同时又派人对此事进行“调查”。李奇微并在十七日发表声明，对汉莱“遽尔发表”这个声明，表示
    “非常遗憾”。美国国防部也慌忙推卸责任。它在十四日晚发表公报，说明“该报告在发表前并未与此间官员咨商”。美国国防部新闻处长佛利契在十七日又慌忙地说：美国国防部“还没有得到什么情报可以证实这种说法（指汉莱的谎言）”。
    美国的大骗子企图使汉莱充当替罪羊，但汉莱却招供了实际情况。据合众社、美联社消息，汉莱承认：“我当然是奉到高级官员的批准才发表这个消息的。”汉莱说，叫他发表捏造谎言的指示，“是总部参谋处经过正常的途径发下来的，他本人遵奉了这项指示”。他并且说：“我从总部新闻处得到许可以后才发表了数字。”
    现在，美国骗子们似乎已感到事情已发展到对他们十分不好。据国际新闻社东京十八日电，美国“陆军方面今天不许汉莱和记者见面。汉莱可能仍在东京，可是记者们今天虽力图和他见面，都因陆军方面的阻止而达不到目的”。美国骗子们大概以为这样就可以不致泄露他们的阴谋了。但是，西洋镜并不因此就没有被拆穿。事实上，人人都看到，汉莱只不过是一具传声筒，站在他背后的是东京和华盛顿的美国大骗子。所谓朝中人民军队“屠杀俘虏”云云，完全是美国侵略者无耻透顶的大撒谎。
