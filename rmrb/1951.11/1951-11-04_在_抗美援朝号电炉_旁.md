Beside the "Resist America, Aid Korea Electric Furnace"
Tangshan Industrial Labor Model Feng Zhentang

We have been working and studying beside the "Resist America, Aid Korea Electric Furnace" for ten months now. Our output has been increasing month by month, exceeding the task every month.

Our steelmaking furnace was built last August. At first, the three shifts of fifty-seven people each had their own ideas. When the Resist America, Aid Korea movement started, everyone held meetings, discussions, and recalled past sufferings. The fifty-seven people shared one heart, saying, "When we think of Resist America, Aid Korea, what knots can't we untie?" From then on, the group became like a line; when one end is pulled, the other end moves. In December, Engineer Sun put forward a rationalization proposal to expand the furnace cavity. Everyone put forward the competition slogan: "Produce one more steel ingot, kill one more American devil." Production efficiency improved, and the January task was completed in fourteen days. The higher authorities gave us a glorious title: "Resist America, Aid Korea Electric Furnace."

We are determined not to let down this glorious title. In the past eight months, we have created four major new records, twenty-three ordinary new records, improved technology eighteen times, and put forward twelve rationalization proposals; we completed the first half of the year's production task one month and eight days ahead of schedule. In August, we also performed hot repairs on the steelmaking furnace. Previously, repairing the furnace took one hundred and twenty hours; this time, it only took twenty hours. Comrades rushed into the furnace with a temperature of over eight hundred degrees.

Beside the "Resist America, Aid Korea Electric Furnace," we have established a patriotic pact. We read newspapers for half an hour every day. We love to read Korean dispatches the most, and we are most concerned about the news of the Volunteer Army in Korea. We look at our fiery red molten steel, hoping that this steel can be delivered to the Volunteer Army as soon as possible and severely strike the American devils.

Beside the "Resist America, Aid Korea Electric Furnace," we hold a meeting every week to check the patriotic pact. Facing this furnace of fiery red steel, we seem to be facing the Volunteer Army on the Korean front. Comrades who have not worked well enough have made self-criticisms, promising to resolutely complete the country's tasks.

Beside the "Resist America, Aid Korea Electric Furnace," we study technology diligently. Originally, there were no steelmaking technicians among us, but now four people have become formal technicians and three are semi-finished workers. The number of technicians for building furnace bases has increased from one to nine, and the number of casting technicians has increased from one to three. (Attached picture)

    在“抗美援朝号电炉”旁
    唐山工业劳动模范  冯振唐
    我们工作、学习在“抗美援朝号电炉”旁，已经有十个月了。我们的产量月月上升，月月超过任务。
    我们这个炼钢炉是去年八月建立的。乍一上来，三班五十七个人，一人一个心思。抗美援朝运动一起来，大伙开会、座谈、回忆、诉苦，五十七个人抱一颗心，都说：“一想到抗美援朝，还有什么解不开的疙瘩。”从此小组像一条线，这边牵一下，那头就动起来。十二月份，孙工程师提出合理化建议，把炉腔容量扩大。大伙提出竞赛口号：“多出一根钢，多打死一个美国鬼子。”生产效率提高，一月份的任务在十四天就完成了。上级送给一个光荣称号：“抗美援朝号电炉”。
    我们决心不辜负这个光荣称号。八个月来，我们创造了四次大的新纪录，二十三次普通新纪录，改进技术十八次，提出了十二件合理化建议；提前一个月零八天完成上半年的生产任务。八月份我们又热修炼钢炉。以前修炉要一百二十小时，这次只花了二十小时。同志们都抢先闯进八百多度高温的炉子去。
    在“抗美援朝号电炉”旁，我们订立了爱国公约。我们每天读报半小时。我们最爱读朝鲜通讯，最关心志愿军在朝鲜的消息，我们看看我们火红的钢水，盼望这些钢能够早点送到志愿军手中，狠狠打击美国鬼子。
    在“抗美援朝号电炉”旁，我们每星期开一次会检查爱国公约。面对着这一炉火红的钢，我们好像面对着朝鲜前线的志愿军。工作得不够好的同志都进行了自我批评，保证要坚决完成国家的任务。
    在“抗美援朝号电炉”旁，我们用功地学习技术。我们中间原来没有炼钢技工，现在有四个人成为正式技工、三个人是半成工了。造炉底座技工由一人培养到九人，浇注技工由一人培养到了三人。（附图片）
