    Beijing Municipal People's Court
    Sentences Criminals Wang Wenzhi and Bai Xiuchen to Death for Abusing and Killing Their Wife and Daughter
    [Our Newspaper] (Beijing News Agency): According to the Beijing News Agency, on November 26th, the Beijing Municipal People's Court publicly tried Wang Wenzhi for abusing and injuring his wives Wang Liu and Gu Guangzhen, resulting in their deaths, and Bai Xiuchen for killing his adopted daughter Bai Cuiling and injuring Guan Bai, Shao Li, and Liu Zhang. Wang Wenzhi and Bai Xiuchen were sentenced to death.
    The public trial began at 1 p.m., presided over by Wang Feiran, President of the Beijing Municipal People's Court and Chief Judge. Pan Shouqian, a prosecutor from the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate, performed his duties. Zhang Xiaomei, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Women's Federation, and Vice Chairman Liu Qingyang were assessors. The audience included urban residents and suburban farmers, representatives from central and municipal government agencies, people's organizations, democratic parties, and some factories and schools, totaling over 1,300 people.
    The first defendant on trial was Wang Wenzhi. After He Zhanjun, Chief of the Criminal Tribunal of the Beijing Municipal People's Court, announced the case details, the victims and their families made accusations. Wang Yonglan, who was raped, occupied, and cruelly abused by Wang Wenzhi, Gu Li, the mother of victim Gu Guangzhen, and Liu Wanku, the nephew of Wang Liu, who was kicked to death by Wang Wenzhi while pregnant, all accused Wang Wenzhi of his crimes in court. Many of those who spoke from the audience were neighbors of Wang, who supplemented Wang's criminal facts and believed that Wang Wenzhi's acts of playing with and oppressing women, abusing and killing his wives, and killing infants were heinous crimes. They unanimously demanded that the People's Government execute Wang by shooting.
    During the trial of the murderer Bai Xiuchen, Zhou Liu and Zhou Fengxiang, the biological mother and father of the victim Bai Cuiling, traveled from Xincheng despite their illness to make accusations. They said, "After Bai Xiuchen asked someone to take my daughter as his adopted daughter, he constantly beat and scolded her. When we went to see her, we were not allowed to meet; once we met, we were not allowed to talk while eating at the same table, and we were driven away at night. He was a puppet Baozhang [local leader under the KMT] at that time, and we couldn't afford to offend him. After liberation, he cut my daughter to death." At this point, Zhou Fengxiang and his wife, due to old age and illness, became too angry and grief-stricken to continue speaking, and Jia Runtin, the uncle of the victim Bai Cuiling, continued the accusation. Guan Bai, Shao Li, and Liu Zhang, who were injured, raised their arms and fingers, which had been maimed by the cutting, and painfully recounted the circumstances of being injured by Bai. Citizens who attended the hearing spoke one after another, unanimously demanding that the People's Government execute Bai Xiuchen. Many residents and marriage law propagandists pointed out in their speeches that the incident of Bai Xiuchen murdering his adopted daughter, occurring more than two years after the liberation of Beijing, although an isolated and special phenomenon, was an absolutely intolerable act of extreme barbaric feudalism. Everyone believed that the propaganda work of the Marriage Law should be carried out regularly, universally, and deeply in the future.
    The procuratorial and assessment benches successively expressed their opinions on the two cases. Liu Qingyang, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Women's Federation, pointed out: "In order to ensure the safety of women and children's lives and protect the legitimate rights of women and children, I, on behalf of all women and children in Beijing, file an accusation, demanding that the government impose the death penalty on the two criminals to uphold the national law."
    Finally, Judge Wang Feiran separately announced the verdicts:
    (1) The defendant Wang Wenzhi has consistently raped women and abused his wives Wang Liu and Gu Guangzhen: kicking Wang Liu and her fetus to death; abandoning Gu Guangzhen, resulting in her death and the death of her infant after childbirth; and after raping Wang Yonglan, subjecting her to abuse, etc. He is sentenced to death.
    Wang Yonglan is permitted to terminate her cohabitation relationship with Wang Wenzhi; their son Wang Changsuo (three years old) and daughter Wang Xiaonv (one year old) shall be raised by Wang Yonglan.
    All of Wang Wenzhi's due family property shall belong to Wang Yonglan as living expenses and child support.
    (2) The defendant Bai Xiuchen is sentenced to death for killing his adopted daughter Bai Cuiling and injuring Guan Bai, Shao Li, and Liu Zhang.
    In addition to bearing the medical expenses of 1,668,000 yuan for Guan Bai, Shao Li, and Liu Zhang, the defendant Bai Xiuchen shall further pay Guan Bai, Shao Li, and Liu Zhang consolation money of 2,000,000 yuan each.
    The defendant Bai Xiuchen shall pay Zhou Fengxiang and Zhou Liu 5,000,000 yuan in consolation money.
    The murder weapons, one kitchen knife, one axe, one razor, and one pair of scissors, as well as the three bloody clothes of the deceased Bai Cuiling, are all confiscated.

    北京市人民法院
    判决虐杀妻女的罪犯王文治白秀宸死刑
    【本报讯】据北京市新闻处讯：北京市人民法院在十一月二十六日，公开审判王文治虐待、伤害其妻王刘氏、顾广珍致死，和白秀宸杀死养女白翠玲、杀伤关白氏、邵李氏、刘张氏两案，并判决王文治、白秀宸死刑。
    公开审判在下午一时开始，由北京市人民法院院长兼审判长王斐然主审，北京市人民检察署由检察员潘守谦履行职务，北京市民主妇女联合会主席张晓梅、副主席刘清扬陪审。参加旁听的有城区市民和郊区农民，中央和市级机关、人民团体、民主党派和一部分工厂、学校的代表，共一千三百余人。
    第一个受审的是罪犯王文治，在北京市人民法院刑事审判庭庭长贺战军宣布案情后，就由被害人和被害人家属进行控诉。被王文治强奸、霸占、残酷虐待的王永兰、被害人顾广珍的母亲顾李氏、被王文治在临产时踢死的王刘氏的外甥刘万库，都在法庭上控诉了王文治的罪行。旁听发言的多是王犯所在地的邻居，他们补充了王犯的犯罪事实，并认为王文治玩弄欺压妇女，虐待杀害妻子，掏杀婴儿，罪恶重大。他们一致要求人民政府将王犯枪毙。
    审判杀人犯白秀宸时，被害人白翠玲的生母周刘氏和生父周凤祥从新城带着病赶来控诉。他们说：“白秀宸托人要我女儿作他养女后，不是打就是骂。我们去看她，也不许见面；有一次见面了，同在一桌上吃饭，也不许谈话，夜里就撵我们走。他那时当伪保长，惹不起他。解放后，又把我女儿砍死了。”这时周凤祥夫妇因年老带病，气愤悲痛，不能继续说下去，由被害人白翠玲的姨夫贾润庭继续控诉。被砍伤的关白氏、邵李氏、刘张氏举起被砍伤成残废的手膀、手指，痛诉她们受白犯杀伤的情形。参加旁听的市民纷纷发言，一致要求人民政府枪毙白秀宸。不少居民和婚姻法宣传员在发言时指出，白秀宸凶杀养女的事件，发生在北京解放后两年多的今天，虽是个别特殊的现象，但这种极端野蛮残酷的封建行为，是绝对不能容许的。大家都认为，婚姻法的宣传工作，应该在今后经常、普遍、深入地进行。
    检察席陪审席先后就两案发表意见。北京市民主妇女联合会副主席刘清扬指出：“为了保障妇女和儿童的生命安全，保护妇女和儿童的合法权利，我代表北京市全市妇女儿童，提出控诉，要求政府对两犯，处以极刑，以彰国法。”
    最后由审判长王斐然分别宣示判决：
    （一）被告王文治一贯奸污妇女，并虐待其妻王刘氏和顾广珍：将王刘氏及其胎儿踢伤致死；遗弃顾广珍，致于分娩后与婴儿相继死亡；霸奸王永兰后，更施以虐待等罪行，处死刑。
    准王永兰与王文治终止同居关系；所生之子王长锁（三岁）女王小女（一岁）均归王永兰抚养。
    王文治应得的家庭财产，全归王永兰作为生活费和子女抚育费。
    （二）被告白秀宸杀死养女白翠玲，杀伤关白氏、邵李氏、刘张氏，处死刑。
    被告白秀宸除负担关白氏、邵李氏、刘张氏医疗费一百六十六万八千元外，应再给付关白氏、邵李氏、刘张氏抚慰费各二百万元。
    被告白秀宸应给付周凤祥周刘氏抚慰费五百万元。
    凶器菜刀一把、斧子一把、剃头刀一把、剪子一把，死者白翠玲血衣三件均予没收。
