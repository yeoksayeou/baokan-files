    Beijing Eighth District Marriage Law Enforcement Inspection Committee's inspection team focused on inspecting the implementation of the Marriage Law in the 12th Precinct area on November 15th. After widespread publicity, meetings were held at the block and courtyard levels, and separate meetings were convened for mothers-in-law, husbands, and daughters-in-law. At the mothers-in-law and husbands' symposiums, those who had abused their daughters-in-law and wives made self-criticisms in public or were criticized, and admitted their mistakes. At the mothers-in-law's meeting, An Li said: "I used to scold my daughter-in-law often, and even beat her. Now I know that it was wrong (not only wrong, but also illegal! - Editor). I guarantee that I won't scold or beat my daughter-in-law again in the future. We'll discuss everything as a family." Ying Ma did not admit her mistake of beating and scolding her daughter-in-law. The mothers-in-law at the meeting criticized her, saying: "Everyone on the street knows what you did. It's wrong for you to beat and scold your daughter-in-law, you should admit your mistake and correct it in the future." Finally, she also admitted her mistake. Some mothers-in-law said: "When we were daughters-in-law in the past, we suffered from our mothers-in-law. Now that we are mothers-in-law, we should no longer abuse our daughters-in-law." She stated on the spot that she would no longer interfere with her daughter's freedom of marriage. After the meeting, many mothers-in-law immediately changed their attitude towards their daughters-in-law. After returning home, An Li admitted her past mistakes to her daughter-in-law that same day. Ma Li used to forbid her daughter-in-law from attending night school. After returning from the meeting, she immediately told her daughter-in-law to sign up for night school. At the husbands' symposium, everyone criticized Ma Yuqi's behavior of beating and scolding his wife. Ma Yuqi initially did not admit that beating and scolding his wife was wrong, saying that he "beat his wife because she burned the quilt." The group then held a discussion on the topic of "Should one be beaten for burning the quilt?" Ma Qiming said: "Burning the quilt was a temporary carelessness, and one should not be beaten." Someone said: "No matter what, it's wrong to hit someone." "The act of beating and scolding his wife shows that he still has very strong feudal ideas." Finally, Ma Yuqi admitted his mistake and made a self-criticism, saying: "This behavior is wrong, and I guarantee that I will never do it again in the future." At the meeting, another seven or eight husbands also reviewed their past mistakes of beating and scolding their wives. At the daughters-in-law's symposium, many people complained about the suffering they had endured in the past and asked the government to educate their mothers-in-law and husbands. They also felt that with the Marriage Law, women's rights were guaranteed.

    北京八区婚姻法执行情况检查组
    召集婆婆丈夫举行座谈会
    虐待媳妇、妻子的都承认了错误
    十一月十五日，北京市第八区婚姻法执行情况检查委员会检查组重点检查第十二派出所辖区关于婚姻法执行情况。经过普遍宣传，开片会、院会，又分别召开了婆婆会、丈夫会与媳妇会。在婆婆、丈夫座谈会上，凡是虐待过媳妇、妻子的，都当众进行了自我批评或受到批评，并承认了错误。在婆婆会上，安李氏说：“我过去经常骂儿媳妇，也打过。现在知道是错了（不仅是错，而且是犯法的！——编者）。我以后保证不打骂媳妇了，有什么事全家商量着办。”应马氏不承认打骂媳妇的错误，到会的婆婆们批评她说：“你的事，咱街上谁不知道？你打骂媳妇是不对的，应当承认错误，今后改过。”最后她也承认了自己的错误。有的婆婆说：“过去咱们做媳妇的时候，受婆婆的气。现在咱们做了婆婆，就不应当再虐待媳妇。”当场她表示以后不再干涉女儿的婚姻自由了。会后，很多婆婆马上改变了对媳妇的态度。安李氏回去之后，当天就向媳妇承认了过去的错误。马李氏过去不许媳妇上夜校，开会回去之后，立即叫媳妇去夜校报名。在丈夫座谈会上，大家对马玉琦打骂妻子的行为展开批评。马玉琦最初不承认打骂妻子是不对的，他说他“打老婆是因为她把棉被烧了。”大伙就以“烧了棉被是否应当打”为题展开讨论。马启明说：“烧了被子是一时粗心大意，不应该打。”有人说：“不管什么事，打人就不对。”“打骂妻子的行为，说明了他还有很浓厚的封建意识。”最后马玉琦承认了错误，并作自我批评说：“这种行为是错误的，我保证今后不再犯了。”会上还有另外七、八个丈夫检讨了过去打骂妻子的错误行为。在媳妇座谈会上，很多人都申诉自己过去所遭受的痛苦，要求政府对婆婆、丈夫进行教育。她们并感到，有了婚姻法，妇女的权益才有了保障。
