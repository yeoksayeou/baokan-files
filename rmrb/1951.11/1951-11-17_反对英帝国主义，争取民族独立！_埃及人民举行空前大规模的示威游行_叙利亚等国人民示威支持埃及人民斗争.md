Xinhua News Agency, 16th. The Egyptian people's movement against British imperialism and for national independence is rising higher and higher. To commemorate the 33rd anniversary of the founding of the Wafd Party, when Zaghloul first called on the Egyptian people to resist British aggression, about 500,000 people in various cities across Egypt held anti-British imperialist demonstrations on the 13th. In Alexandria alone, 250,000 people participated in the demonstrations. On the 14th, more than one million Egyptians in Cairo held demonstrations, demanding the immediate withdrawal of British troops from Egypt. This included more than 5,000 women who, disregarding the Islamic religious rules that dictate they stay at home, also participated in the march. The scale of these consecutive large-scale demonstrations held by the Egyptian people over these two days is unprecedented in the history of the Egyptian people's anti-imperialist struggle.

During the marches on the 13th and 14th, the Egyptian people held many placards and banners with slogans such as "Get out, robbers!", "Down with Churchill!", and "No cooperation with British murderers who kill women and children!"

Xinhua News Agency, 16th. According to TASS, Beirut: On the 14th, 200,000 people in Damascus, the capital of Syria, held a large-scale demonstration in support of the Egyptian people who are fighting to defend their national independence. Almost all the residents of the city went to the streets to express their support for the Egyptian people.

The demonstrators sent telegrams to Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas Pasha, the Speaker of the Egyptian Lower House, the Egyptian Upper House, "Al-Ahram" and "Al-Mokattam," stating: "Egypt has abolished the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty signed in 1936 and rejected the proposal to establish a four-power joint defense system. Syria reiterates its full support for Egypt's actions. Syria believes that the cause of Egypt is the cause of all Arab countries. The Syrian Republic calls on all parties in other Arab countries to join the struggle to get rid of foreign enslavement and strive for the liberation of Arab countries."

The demonstrators also sent a telegram to the United Nations Secretariat, stating: "While the Egyptian people are shedding blood and sacrificing due to the rampaging British occupation forces in the country, all parties in Syria express their full support for Egypt's policy of abolishing the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, which violates the principles of the United Nations Charter stipulating that all member states are equal, sovereign and independent, and prohibiting aggression. Britain's act of aggression in Egypt endangers the cause of peace in the Middle East and the world." Other cities in Syria also held similar demonstrations.

The people of Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, went on strike and boycotted schools and shops on the 14th to support the struggle of the Egyptian people.

The people of Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, also held a general strike and demonstrations on the 14th to support the struggle of the Egyptian people. All factories, educational institutions, and shops in the city were closed that day.

In Gaza and its suburbs in Palestine, more than 20,000 people participated in the demonstrations.

General strikes and demonstrations were also held in the Arab area of ​​Jerusalem, as well as in Ramallah, Tulkarm, Silin, and Galilee, in support of Egypt's position and its opposition to the so-called "joint defense" plan of the imperialists.

In Transjordan, Amman, Irbid, Al-Salt, and other cities held Transjordan's first grand demonstration in support of Arab countries. The people participating in the demonstrations sent many telegrams expressing their support for the Egyptian people.

    反对英帝国主义，争取民族独立！
　　埃及人民举行空前大规模的示威游行
    叙利亚等国人民示威支持埃及人民斗争
    【新华社十六日讯】埃及人民反对英帝国主义、争取民族独立的运动，正愈来愈高涨。为了纪念华夫脱党创始人查格鲁尔首次号召埃及人民反抗英国侵略的三十三周年，埃及全国各城市约有五十万人在十三日举行了反对英帝国主义示威游行，其中亚历山大港一地参加示威游行的就有二十五万人。十四日，开罗市又有一百多万埃及人举行了示威游行，要求英军立即撤出埃及，其中包括五千多名妇女，她们不顾回教的教规规定她们留在家里，也参加了游行。埃及人民这两天连续举行的大示威，它的规模的广大，在埃及人民反帝斗争历史上是空前的。
    埃及人民在十三、十四日游行时举着许多标语牌和旗帜，上面写着“强盗们滚出去”，“打倒邱吉尔”，“不要和杀害妇女儿童的英国凶手合作”等口号。
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社贝鲁特讯：叙利亚首都大马士革十四日有二十万人举行大规模的示威游行，声援正为保卫民族独立而斗争的埃及人民。该城的全体居民几乎都到街上去表示支持埃及人民。
    示威游行者致电埃及首相纳哈斯帕夏、埃及下议院议长、埃及上议院、“埃及人报”及“金字塔报”说：“埃及已废除一九三六年签订的英埃条约，并拒绝成立四国联防体系的建议。叙利亚再度表示全力支持埃及的这种行动。叙利亚认为埃及的事业就是所有阿拉伯国家的事业。叙利亚共和国号召阿拉伯其他国家的各党派一道参加摆脱外国奴役、争取阿拉伯国家解放的斗争。”
    示威游行者并致电联合国秘书处，电文说：“在埃及人民正由于英占领军在该国横行而流血牺牲的时候，叙利亚所有各党派表示全力支持埃及废除一九三六年英埃条约的政策，这个条约违反了规定所有会员国一律平等和主权独立以及禁止侵略的联合国宪章的原则。英国在埃及的侵略行动危害了中东和全世界的和平事业。”叙利亚的其他城市同时也举行了这种示威游行。
    黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特的人民在十四日实行罢工、罢课和罢市，声援埃及人民的斗争。
    伊拉克首都巴格达的人民十四日也举行总罢工和示威游行，声援埃及人民的斗争。该城所有的工厂、教育机关和商店那天都关了门。
    在巴勒斯坦的加萨及其近郊，参加示威游行的有两万余人。
    耶路撒冷的阿拉伯区以及拉姆阿拉、图尔卡姆、西林和加利利等地也曾举行总罢工和示威游行，支持埃及及其反对帝国主义者的所谓“联防”计划的立场。
    在外约旦，首都安曼、伊尔比德艾沙尔特及其他各城举行了外约旦第一次的支持阿拉伯国家的盛大示威游行。参加示威游行的人们发出许多通电表示支持埃及人民。
