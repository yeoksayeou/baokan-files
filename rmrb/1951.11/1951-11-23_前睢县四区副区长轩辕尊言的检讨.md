Self-Criticism of Xuan Yuanzunyan, Former Deputy District Chief of the Fourth District of Suixian County

On the morning of August 28, 1948, I went to Shaopen Li Village to examine the body of Liang Anshi. At that time, Shaopen Li Village was a village where the masses had not been mobilized and the masses' awareness was low. Therefore, when I arrived at the village, I only sought to understand the situation from the village cadres and summoned the person who had taken down the body to ask about the circumstances of the removal, and then, together with Liang Anshi's uncle, aunt, and elderly aunt, I examined the body. We started with the deceased's head and gradually examined downwards. When examining the genitals, a woman from Liang Anshi's family, due to feudal ideas, said, "It's nothing, don't examine it." I also had this feudal thinking and did not insist. No examination procedures were carried out after the examination. Although a large number of people were present during the inspection, the masses had no new reactions because Liang's family members were also present. After I returned to the district to discuss this matter, I considered Liang Anshi to have died by hanging. Now I examine my own thoughts: First, I have a serious, crude, and careless bureaucratic work style regarding the protection of people's lives and safety. Second, because I have residual feudal thoughts, I did not examine the deceased's genitals in detail. Third, I hold a seriously irresponsible attitude toward guaranteeing human rights. From the time the case occurred until I left office more than 40 days later, I only paid attention to bandit suppression and anti-local tyrant work, and did not investigate the details of this case. To sum up, my work was "one-man show" and my work style was bureaucratic.

The above thoughts and work style are the most harmful and deepest to the people. In addition to sincerely accepting your newspaper's criticism, I must be vigilant in my future work, investigate all work in detail, follow the mass line, and overcome my previous bad work style.

    前睢县四区副区长轩辕尊言的检讨
    一九四八年八月二十八日早晨，我到烧盆李村检验梁安氏的尸体。当时烧盆李村是一个群众未经发动的村庄，群众觉悟低。因此我到了该村，只找着村干部了解了一下情况，又叫出卸吊人，问了问卸吊情况，即会同梁安氏的叔父及其婶子大娘检验尸体。先由死者头部验起，逐步下验。验阴部时，梁安氏娘家的一个妇女因为有封建思想，说：“不怎么样，不要验了。”我也有这种封建思想，就没有坚持意见。验尸后也没有办理检验手续。检验时虽有广大群众在场，但因梁家的人也在，群众没有新的反应。我回区研究后，即认为梁安氏是吊死的。现在检查自己的思想：一是对保障人民生命安全上有一种严重的粗枝大叶的官僚主义作风。二是因为有残余的封建思想，没有详细地检验死者的阴部。三是对保障人权抱有严重的不负责任态度。自该案发生到我离职的四十多天中，我只注意了剿匪和反恶霸工作，而没有详细调查此案情况。总起来说，在工作上是“单打一”，作风上是官僚主义。
    以上这种思想和作风，是对人民危害最大最深的。我除诚恳接受贵报批评外，今后在工作中一定要警惕起来，一切工作都要详细调查，走群众路线，克服以前的不良作风。
