Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 25th: Our front-line reporter reports: The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have continued to achieve victories in eliminating enemy forces during the blocking and counter-attack operations from the 16th to the 20th of this month. On the western front, a unit of our army counter-attacked enemy positions on Dongshan, east of Fengshudong, west of Tieyuan, on the 17th, wiping out a platoon of the 3rd Company of the 8th Regiment of the US Cavalry First Division. Enemy troops constantly attempting to intrude into the vicinity of the Panmunjom neutral zone have been repelled by our forces.

On the 19th, a portion of the enemy troops in the Jinshua northeast area paid a heavy price in casualties to occupy a position that our army had voluntarily evacuated. However, at dusk on the same day, this position was retaken by a unit of our army in a counter-attack, killing or wounding more than 200 enemy soldiers. On the 16th, more than 100 enemy soldiers invaded an advanced position held by a squad of a unit of our army northwest of Jincheon. Several charges were repelled, resulting in the enemy suffering more than 30 casualties before retreating in defeat. On the evening of the 20th, a unit of our army, with artillery support, counter-attacked the enemy on Xishan, west of Kōkōri, east of Jincheon. The battle lasted only half an hour, annihilating the entire 5th Company of the 2nd Regiment of the 6th Division of the Rhee puppet army and a portion of the 7th Company, killing or wounding more than 150 enemy soldiers.

On the eastern front, our army has been engaged in heroic battles in heavy snow for days and has achieved significant victories. On the 17th, two enemy regiments, under the cover of aircraft and artillery fire, launched a fierce attack on a strip of land approximately several kilometers wide from Tongsonggok to Garojae, north of Yanggu. After being struck by our forces, the enemy reinforced with four regiments on the 18th and continued the attack, dispatching more than 80 sorties of aircraft to alternately bomb our positions. However, when enemy infantry, coerced by officers, launched an attack on our positions, our artillery fiercely bombarded the enemy infantry and used dense machine-gun fire to shoot down the few enemies who rushed to the front of our positions. After two days of intense fighting, the enemy suffered more than 2,000 casualties, gaining only a few hilltops that our army had voluntarily evacuated. This severely battered enemy force regrouped on the 19th and continued to attack on the 20th; however, the result was that more than 900 more of their troops were killed or wounded by a unit of our army.

On the east coast, after our army recovered Goseong on the evening of the 16th, it took advantage of the victory to cross the Nam River and on the 18th recovered the Yuefeishan and Guseonbong line of positions five kilometers south of Goseong, repelling several enemy counterattacks.

    朝中人民部队继续进行阻击和反击战
  　各线大量歼敌有生力量
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十五日电】本社前线记者报道：朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在本月十六日至二十日的阻击战和反击战中，继续取得歼敌有生力量的胜利。西线我军某部在十七日反击铁原以西枫树洞东山的敌军阵地，歼灭美军骑兵第一师第八团第三连的一个排。不断向板门店中立区附近窜犯的敌军，都被我军击退。
    十九日，中线金化东北地区敌军一部，付出重大的伤亡占领了我军主动撤出的一个阵地。但在同日黄昏，这个阵地就被我军某部在反击中夺回，并杀伤敌军二百多名。十六日，敌军百余名进犯金城西北上里我军某部一个班据守的前沿阵地，数次冲锋都被击退，结果敌人遭受三十多名伤亡后败退。二十日晚，我军一部在炮火支援下向金城以东科湖里西山的敌人反击，战斗仅半小时，歼灭李伪军第六师第二团第五连全部，第七连的一部，杀伤敌人一百五十多名。
    在东线，我军连日在大雪纷飞中进行英勇的战斗，并获得重大胜利。十七日，敌军两个团在飞机炮火掩护下，向杨口以北通先谷至加罗峙约数公里宽的地带猛犯；遭受我军打击后，敌人又在十八日增兵至四个团，继续进犯，并出动飞机八十余架次，轮番轰炸我军阵地。但当敌军步兵在军官胁迫下向我发起冲锋时，我军炮火就对准敌步兵猛烈轰击，并用密集的机枪火力射击少数冲到我阵地前沿的敌人。激战两天，敌军伤亡二千多名，而所得的仅是我军主动撤出的几个山头。这股遭到严重打击的敌军，在十九日又重新调集部队，在二十日继续进犯；但结果又被我军某部杀伤九百多人。
    在东海岸，我军某部在十六日晚收复高城后，就乘胜渡过南江，于十八日又收复高城以南五公里的月飞山及九仙峰一线阵地，并打退敌军数度反扑。
