    Conscientiously Learn and Promote Qu Yaoli's Experience in Achieving High Yields
    The new national record for cotton yield per unit area created by Qu Yaoli, a cotton farmer in Jie County, Shanxi Province, has attracted the attention of people across the country.
    The reason Qu Yaoli was able to create a new national record for cotton yield per unit area is that he responded to the call of the Party and the government, realized organization to develop production, and created rich technical experience. His technical experience, such as paying attention to the overall improvement of comprehensive techniques, reasonably controlling and adjusting the coordinated implementation of various yield-increasing factors, flexibly carrying out precise field management according to specific conditions, implementing diligent and light irrigation techniques, and appropriately increasing planting density, completely conforms to scientific principles and is fully in line with the advanced Soviet cotton planting technology and experience. These advanced experiences should be well promoted.
    Some people say, is Qu Yaoli's outstanding high-yield achievement due to his particularly superior production conditions? According to investigations and understanding, Qu Yaoli's family has a total of fourteen people, farming more than sixty mu of land. In addition to two main laborers, the others are women and children; his high-yield cotton field is medium-fertility, alkaline loam; the well water he irrigates his cotton field with is bitter water; it can be seen that his labor force and production conditions are not more superior than others. Therefore, we can believe that the main reason why Qu Yaoli was able to create such excellent high-yield achievements is because of his good labor and because he created superior technical experience. As long as everyone appropriately learns from his experience based on local conditions, the new record of cotton yield per unit area that he has created can be gradually achieved in various places.

    认真学习和推广曲耀离的丰产经验
    山西省解县棉农曲耀离创造的全国棉田单位面积产量新纪录，已引起全国人民的注意。
    曲耀离所以能创造全国棉田单位面积产量新纪录，是由于他响应党与政府的号召，实现了组织起来，发展生产，并且创造了丰富的技术经验。他所创造的技术经验中，例如：注意整体技术的全面改进，合理控制和调节各项增产因子的配合实施，根据具体情况，灵活地进行精密的田间管理，实行勤浇轻浇的灌溉技术，适当地增加植棉密度等等，完全符合于科学的原理，是和苏联先进的植棉技术经验完全吻合的。这些先进经验，应该很好地加以发扬。
    有人说，曲耀离创造了突出的丰产成绩，是不是由于他具有特殊优越的生产条件呢？根据调查了解，曲耀离家中共有十四口人，种了六十多亩地。除了两个主要劳动力外，其他都是妇女小孩；他的丰产的棉田，是中等肥度带碱性的壤土；他的棉田所浇的井水是苦水；可见他的劳动力和生产条件，是并不比别人优越的。因此，我们可以相信，曲耀离所以能创造出这样优异的丰产成绩，主要是由于他的劳动好，是由于他创造了优越的技术经验。大家只要根据当地具体情况，恰当地学习他的经验，那么，他所创造的棉田单位面积产量的新纪录，各地都是可能逐步达到的。
