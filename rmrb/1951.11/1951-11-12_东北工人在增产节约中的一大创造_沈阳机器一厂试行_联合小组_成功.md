　　A Major Creation of Northeast Workers in Increasing Production and Practicing Economy
　　Successful Trial of "Joint Groups" in Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant
　　By our reporter Lin Li
　　In the movement to increase production and practice economy, the working class of Northeast China has created various new methods for increasing production and practicing economy. The "joint group" of Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, under the Mechanical Bureau of the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government, is one of the most valuable among many creations. This "joint group" adopts a new method of semi-assembly line operation under the condition of insufficient machinery and equipment, and has found a new way to tap the potential of machines and improve workshop work. The implementation of this new method of work means a comprehensive reform from machine arrangement to labor organization, from work system to management methods.
　　The No. 1 Machine Tool Plant is a large factory manufacturing machine tools, specializing in the manufacture of shapers and six-foot lathes. The second workshop of the plant is the core of the whole plant. The second workshop processes 854 parts of different shapes for a machine, including more than 6,000 processes. The large number of parts and the complexity of the processes require scientific division of labor and management. Before the movement to increase production and practice economy, the plant's machinery and equipment were unbalanced, and the machine arrangement followed the old "machine cluster" pattern, which made it impossible to implement scientific operations. The so-called "machine cluster" is composed of machines such as lathes, planers, milling machines, and turning machines. Lathes are arranged together and planers are arranged on one side, which looks very neat, but it is not practical. Because it does not take into account the processing sequence of product parts at all. Thousands of parts of different shapes do not proceed according to the arrangement sequence of the machines. For example, some parts are planed first and then turned, some are turned first and then planed, some are turned and then planed, or planed and then milled, some are processed back and forth seventeen times, and some only need to be processed once. These complex parts, especially their operators, are controlled by fixed machines, which increases the round-trip time and makes it impossible to implement advanced assembly line operations.
　　The labor organization adapted to the "machine cluster" machine arrangement is five shifts and sixteen groups of turning, planing, milling, and turning workers. There is no horizontal connection between groups and between members. Everyone is processing parts, but no one knows where the parts come from or where they are sent to, and therefore does not know the importance of the parts in the entire production process. The result of blind processing is that what is easy to do is done; what is skilled is done, without considering the needs of the upper and lower processes or the assembly site. Therefore, easy-to-make parts are blocked and accumulated, and difficult-to-make parts cannot keep up with assembly. However, the most difficult parts are often the most important parts. This is the reason why the plant often affects the entire machine assembly and even the work of the entire assembly workshop due to the failure to supply a part in time.
　　The work system adapted to the above-mentioned machinery and equipment and organizational structure is also unreasonable. Each shift and group and each member are only responsible for processing, but not responsible for the finished parts. Thousands of machine parts must pass through the hands of the workshop director or several managers each time they are processed. However, a small number of managers cannot distribute the extremely complex processes so reasonably. As a result, the operators of parts with less processing often wait for materials to stop work, and the operators of parts with more processing must work overtime. According to the survey, more than 20,000 hours were wasted due to waiting for materials to stop work in the first half of the year, and the overtime hours were no less than this. These more than 20,000 hours are enough to manufacture ten lathes. Due to the massive waste of man-hours, the plant is often unable to complete its tasks, especially in the third quarter, only 31.6% of the planned tasks were completed.
　　The leaders of the plant have long felt that this serious unreasonable situation cannot continue. But they don't know where to start to change this situation. After researching with the workers, Zhao Changling and Wang Wenshan, the directors of the second workshop, put forward the suggestion of establishing a mixed-type, production-specialized
　　"joint group".
　　The so-called "joint group" is to dismantle the "machine cluster" machine arrangement and the resulting labor organization, and then re-equip machines and manpower according to the product processing sequence. That is, according to the complexity, difficulty, weight, and size of the parts, separate sections and groups are formed. Each section or group operates a variety of machines and is independently responsible for completing one or several processed parts. This group is equipped with a variety of machines, so it is called a mixed type of work. But each worker's work object is fixed, and the machine is also fixed. Unlike in the past, when you do this job today and that job tomorrow, or do this job for a while and that job for a while. Therefore, it is specialized. In the "joint group", the group leader and the group leader, the members and the members are no longer unrelated, only responsible to the workshop director, but the turning worker directly transfers to the planing worker after finishing the turning, and the planing worker directly transfers to the milling worker after finishing the planing. Everyone works together for the finished parts. A natural restraint is added between people and between the upper and lower processes. Therefore, it is also joint. This method of arranging and equipping machines according to the parts processing sequence prepares the conditions for advanced assembly line operations. Production specialization opens the way to improve technical proficiency. The direct relationship between members is a good way to encourage each other, supervise each other, and manage production together.
　　According to this principle, the machine arrangement, labor allocation, work sequence, and management system of the entire workshop must be completely changed. Such a huge and comprehensive production reform has no precedent in China's machinery industry production. Therefore, the plant took very cautious steps when implementing this reform. They studied the management experience of the Soviet mechanical industry, consulted with veteran workers, and asked Soviet experts for specific guidance. Soviet engineer Ponomarev asserted: "The composition of this working group will definitely produce good results." In the Soviet Union, this work organization is called "integrated working group", which is one of the advanced organizational management methods. The broad masses of workers all agreed with the Soviet expert's opinion. In early September, the plant selected several parts that often failed to complete their tasks, transferred 82 skilled workers and some machines, and formed two key pilot groups. The experimental results showed that the machine efficiency was unprecedentedly improved, the output increased, the quality improved, and the man-hours reduced. For example, the large frame of the shaper produced six in August, with two qualified, and after the joint group was formed in September, eight were produced, all of which were qualified. The processing time was reduced from 138 hours to 115 hours. The cost was reduced by 14% compared with before. The machine utilization rate increased from 45.37% to more than 95%. The unreasonable phenomena such as the accumulation of parts that have never been solved, waiting for materials to stop work, and production imbalance have been solved. More importantly, the sense of responsibility of the employees has been enhanced. Every worker not only knows what he is doing, but also knows the impact on the upper and lower processes. If a part cannot complete the task on time, it is not the workshop director who blames him, but the workers of the upper and lower processes first. In addition, production specialization facilitates the improvement of technical proficiency, so the enthusiasm and creativity of workers in their work have been unprecedentedly improved, and technical improvement has become an unprecedented upsurge. The planer that used to cut with one tool is now added with two, or even three or four tools, and the output is also increased three or four times accordingly. Planing the large frame of the shaper has always been one at a time, but now it is six at a time. The workers said, "In the past, it was the workshop director's responsibility if the task was not completed, but now it is our own shame if the task is not completed." The workshop managers said in unison, "This change has liberated the machines and liberated the labor force."
　　With the success of the key pilot in September, the plant completely changed the second workshop into a joint group in early October. That is, according to the parts processing sequence, the original five shifts and sixteen groups of turning, planing, milling, and turning workers were changed into four major sections, namely, main, standard, precision, and general, which were divided into 18 groups. Direct relationships have also been established between groups. A major reform of semi-assembly line operation under the existing machinery and equipment has been completed. The arrangement and adjustment of the entire machine will be carried out after the workers are skilled in operation. However, the original planing workers no longer belong to the planing shift, and the turning workers no longer belong to the turning shift, but belong to a certain section.
　　The victorious completion of the production reform has laid the foundation for completing the national tasks and running the people's enterprises well. The Northeast People's Government Industrial Department Mechanical Bureau originally gave the plant the task of increasing production and practicing economy of 39,000 tons of grain. After discussion and research by the employees, it was automatically increased to 43,000 tons.

　　东北工人在增产节约中的一大创造
    沈阳机器一厂试行“联合小组”成功
    本报记者　林　里
    在增产节约运动中，东北工人阶级创造了各种增产节约的新办法。东北人民政府工业部机械局所属沈阳第一机器厂的“联合小组”，就是许多创造中最有价值的一个。这种“联合小组”，在机械设备不足的情况下，采用半流水作业的新方法，为发挥机器潜在能力、改善车间工作，找到了新的门径。实行这种新工作法，意味着从机器安排到劳动组织，从工作制度到管理方法，进行全面改革。
    第一机器厂是制造工作母机的大工厂，专门制造牛头刨床和六呎车床。该厂第二车间是全厂的核心。第二车间为一台机器的八百五十四种不同形状的部件加工，包括六千多道工序。部件繁多，工序复杂，需要科学的分工与管理。在增产节约运动之前，该厂机器设备不平衡，机器安排又沿袭着“机群式”的陈规，这是不能实行科学操作的。所谓“机群式”，就是以车、刨、铣、镟等机器分别组成。车床和车床排在一起，刨床和刨床排在一边，看来很整齐，但是不合用。因为它丝毫没有顾及产品部件的加工顺序。千百种不同形状的部件，并不按着机器的排列顺序行进。比如，有的部件先刨后车，有的先车后刨、有的车后再刨、或刨后再铣，有的往返加工十七次，有的只需加工一次。这些复杂的部件，特别是它的操作者，均为固定的机器所支配，既增加了往返时间，又不能实行先进的流水作业法。
    适应“机群式”机器安排的劳动组织，是车、刨、铣、镟等五班十六组，组与组之间，成员与成员之间，没有横的联系。大家都对部件加工，但谁也不知道该种部件来自何处，送交何处，因而也就不知道部件在整个生产过程中的重要性。盲目加工的结果，是什么好做，就做什么；什么熟练做什么，毫不考虑上下工序或装配场的需要。因此，容易做的部件淤塞积压，不好做的部件赶不上装配。但是，最难做的部件，常常是最重要的部件。这就是该厂常因一个部件不能及时供应，而影响整个机器装配乃至整个装配车间工作的原因。
    适应上述机器设备和组织机构的工作制度，也是不合理的。各班组与各成员只管加工，但不对部件成品负责。成千上万的机器部件，每次加工都要经过车间主任或几个管理人员之手。但是，少数管理人员，不可能把十分繁复的工序分配得那样合理。于是，加工少的部件操作者常常待料停工，加工多的部件操作者必须加班加点。据调查，上半年因停工待料所浪费的时间达两万多小时，加班加点的时间也不少于此。这两万多小时，足可制造十台车床。由于工时大量浪费，影响该厂经常不能完成任务，特别是第三季度，只完成预定任务的百分之三十一点六。
    这种严重的不合理状况，该厂领导同志早就感到再不能继续下去。但苦于不知从何处着手改变这一情况。第二车间主任赵长龄、王文山等和工人研究的结果，提出了成立混合工种的、生产专业化的
    “联合小组”的建议。
    所谓“联合小组”，就是拆散“机群式”的机器安排与由此而来的劳动组织，然后按着产品加工顺序，重新配备机器和人力。即依照部件产品的繁简难易和轻重大小，分别组成工段和小组。各个工段或小组，操作多种机器，独立负责完成某种或某几种加工部件。这种小组备有多种多样的机器，所以叫作混合工种。但每个工人的工作对象是固定的，机器也是固定的。不像过去那样，今天干这种活，明天干那种活，或者一会干这种活，一会干那种活。因而它是专业化的。在“联合小组”里，组长与组长，成员与成员之间，不再是互不相关，只对车间主任负责的关系，而是车工车完，直接转刨工，刨工刨完，直接转铣工，大家共同为部件成品而加工。人与人之间，上下工序之间，增加了一种自然的制约力。因而它又是联合的。这种按着部件加工顺序排列和配备机器的方法，为先进的流水作业准备了条件。生产专业化为提高技术熟练程度开辟了道路。成员与成员之间的直接关系，是互相鼓励、互相监督、大家管理生产的好办法。
    根据这一原则，整个车间的机器安排、劳力配备，工作顺序与管理制度均须彻底改变。这样巨大的全面的生产改革，在我国机械工业生产上尚无先例。因此，该厂实行这种改革时，采取了十分慎重的步骤。他们研究苏联机械工业的管理经验，和老工人商量，请苏联专家具体指导。苏联工程师波诺马略夫同志断言：“这种工组的组成绝对地能发挥出良好的结果。”在苏联，这种工作组织称为“综合工组”，是先进的组织管理方法之一。广大工人群众都赞成苏联专家的意见。该厂于九月初选择了几种经常不能完成任务的部件，抽调了八十二名技术工人，并一部分机器，组成两个重点试验小组。试验结果是机械效率空前提高，产量增多，质量提高，工时减少。如牛头刨大架子，八月份生产六个，合格两个，九月份组成联合小组后，生产八个，全部合格。加工时间由一百三十八小时，降为一百一十五小时。成本比以前降低百分之十四。机器开动率由百分之四十五点三七，提高到百分之九十五以上。解决了历来不能解决的部件积压，停工待料，生产不平衡等等不合理现象。更重要的是职工责任感增强了。每个工人不仅知道自己做什么，而且知道对上下工序的影响。如果某一部件不能按时完成任务，责备他的不是车间主任，而首先是上下工序的工人。加以生产专业化，便于提高技术熟练程度，因此，工人工作的积极性与创造性就空前提高，改进技术成了前所未有的高潮。从前用一把刀切削的刨床，现在加用二把，甚至三把、四把刀，产量也随之提高三倍或四倍。刨牛头刨大架子，历来都是一次刨一个，现在一次刨六个。工人说：“过去完不成任务是车间主任的责任，现在完不成任务就是自己丢人”。车间管理人员异口同声地说：“这一改，解放了机器，也解放了劳动力。”
    有了九月份重点试验的成效，该厂遂于十月初旬将第二车间全部改为联合小组。即根据部件加工顺序，将原来的车工、刨工、铣工、镟工等五班十六组，改为主要、标准、精密与一般等四大工段，下分十八组。组与组之间也建立了直接关系。完成了在现有机械设备下的半流水作业的重大改革。整个机器的安排与调整，拟在工人操作熟练后进行。但原有的刨工已不再属于刨工班、车工也不属于车工班，而属于某一工段了。
    生产改革的胜利完成，为完成国家任务办好人民企业奠定了基础，东北人民政府工业部机械局原来给予该厂的增产节约任务为三万九千吨粮食，经职工讨论研究后，自动增至四万三千吨。
