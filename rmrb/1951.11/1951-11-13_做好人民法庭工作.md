　　Doing a Good Job in People's Tribunal Work
　　Since last winter, while land reform was being carried out in areas with a population of 154 million agricultural people, the people's governments in these areas, in accordance with the "General Rules for the Organization of People's Tribunals" promulgated by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on July 20, 1950, have successively established county (city) people's tribunals and their branch tribunals. According to incomplete statistics from the Central South, East China, and Southwest Administrative Regions, there are a total of 977 county (city) people's tribunals and 3,693 branch tribunals. The people's tribunals in various places are working under the unified leadership of the local people's governments, and they are guided by the people's courts in their business and by the people's public security bureaus in handling counter-revolutionary cases. The main role of the people's tribunals in land reform is reflected in: 1. In the period before and after land reform and throughout the entire process of land reform, in the struggles against bandits and local bullies, rent reduction and deposit refunds, class division, distribution of fruits, and prevention of landlord counterattacks, they cracked down on counter-revolutionary elements such as local bullies, bandits, and special agents who have long harmed the interests of the people and the state in rural areas, as well as other criminals who violated the land reform laws, clearing or reducing obstacles to land reform. 2. Assisting in mobilizing the masses, supporting the peasants, and encouraging the masses' courage in the anti-feudal struggle. 3. Educating peasants to participate in and master the people's democratic dictatorship, and consolidating the revolutionary order in rural areas. Therefore, it has also created some new experiences in people's judicial construction.
　　This winter and next spring, nearly 100 million agricultural people in our country will carry out land reform again. These areas must do a good job in the people's tribunal work to adapt to the development of the land reform movement. All areas that have completed land reform must continue to summarize the experience of the people's tribunals and deal with the problems left over from land reform, so as to promote the ideological construction of the people's judiciary and strengthen the people's judicial work. Areas where land reform has been completed but needs to be reviewed must further enrich the work of the people's tribunals. We must strive to improve the work of the people's tribunals, so that the people's tribunals in the land reform areas become one of the sharp weapons for directly consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship in the countryside, so that the broad masses of peasants in the countryside can grasp it to defeat the reactionary arrogance of all hostile elements and give play to the power of the peasant masses' struggle. With this weapon, the peasants themselves can prevent unnecessary chaos, prevent unintentional attacks on people who should not be attacked in the fiery anti-feudal struggle, and ensure the smooth completion of land reform. Some people say: "The old revolutionary base areas did not have people's tribunals in the past when land reform was carried out, and the task was still completed?" Some people think that people's tribunals are "dispensable." These opinions are obviously wrong. Facts have proved that the role of the people's tribunals in land reform is very important. Therefore, the people's governments at all levels in the land reform areas should earnestly and responsibly lead the work of the people's tribunals; the people's courts at all levels in the land reform areas must use their main strength to support and participate in the work of the people's tribunals.
　　The people's tribunal is produced to meet the needs of the masses' land reform movement, and it is a powerful tool to support and promote the mass movement. Therefore, the work of the people's tribunal must be closely integrated with the land reform movement, and its establishment time should not fall after the land reform, otherwise it will not be able to play the role of mobilizing the masses in a timely manner. At the same time, the people's tribunal should adapt to the law of development of the land reform movement, and carry out its own work in response to the characteristics of the activities of the reactionary forces and the urgent demands of the peasants in various stages of the movement, so as to promote the land reform movement and carry out the work of the court. In the land reform movement, the people's tribunals in various places have seized the opportunity to punish landlords and local bullies who resisted and sabotaged the land reform and were hated by the peasant masses in various periods of the land reform, in order to crack down on the enemy's arrogance and encourage the masses' fighting spirit, and promote the development of the movement. The party and the people's governments at all levels should attach importance to this experience, and be good at using the people's tribunals as a tool to mobilize the masses, promote the movement, and consolidate the victory. The workers of the people's tribunal should more clearly recognize the role they should play and better serve the mass movement of land reform.
　　Because the people's tribunal is a people's judicial organ with a broader mass character, it is directly connected with the people, relies on the people, and is directly participated by the people. Therefore, it must emphasize the implementation of the mass line in its work. The judges of the people's tribunal must be a combination of appointment and popular election, so that they can be familiar with the local situation and more fully reflect the opinions of the masses. It is very necessary to select a group of popularly elected judges and jurors who represent the peasants (not representing the groups or units that nominated them) from the outstanding elements of the peasant masses and from the activists who have been tempered by the masses' revolutionary struggle to participate in the work of the people's tribunal. This not only opens up a rich source of cadres for the people's tribunal, but also enables the peasant masses to directly participate in the activities of the people's tribunal. The trial method of the people's tribunal should be a combination of court trial and circuit trial. For major and educational cases, public trial can and should be carried out if conditions permit. During the public trial, in addition to mobilizing the masses to participate, landlords can also be ordered to attend. The pronouncements of the people's tribunals should be able to fully reflect the policies of our people's government, so as to play the role of suppressing the enemy and educating the masses. The trial procedures of the people's tribunals should be simplified as much as possible, but judicial procedures cannot be dispensed with, otherwise the trial of the people's tribunals may be confused with the mass struggle meetings. We must oppose the people's tribunals handling cases in isolation and pure court hearings. In the trial work, the people's tribunals must adopt a serious and cautious attitude, and must strictly prevent perfunctoriness and oppose subjective arbitrariness; must strictly prohibit the erroneous practices of not paying attention to evidence, believing confessions easily, and using torture to extract confessions; must comprehensively study the materials obtained from systematic investigation, interrogation, calling for confession, and mass investigation, and then draw conclusions and make judgments based on policies, laws and correct demands of the masses. Contacting the masses, relying on the masses, seeking truth from facts, and conducting investigation and research are the main guarantees for the correct conduct of the people's tribunal's work.
　　In order to develop and strengthen the work of the people's tribunals, it is best to set up a branch tribunal in each district, and the branch tribunal should be the center for trying cases. At the same time, necessary cadres should be allocated to the people's tribunals. The source of cadres should be in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of the "General Rules for the Organization of People's Tribunals" and the experience of various places, that is, the principle of maintaining half of the appointed judges and half of the popularly elected judges in the people's tribunals. Appointed judges can be drawn from the people's courts, people's public security bureaus, land reform work teams, and other departments. Each court must have at least two or three full-time cadres, otherwise, if they are all part-time cadres, the people's tribunal will become an empty sign. Popularly elected judges should be used extensively and conscientiously to overcome the difficulty of insufficient cadres. When allocating cadres to the people's tribunals, it is necessary to select cadres with firm positions and strictly prevent class dissidents from infiltrating. Before the allocated cadres participate in the work, they must be given appropriate training to make them understand the tasks of the people's tribunals, understand how to grasp policies, and learn the mass line in the work of the people's tribunals. This training can be conducted separately by provinces, special districts, and counties. After allocating and training the cadres, the work of the people's tribunals must be given constant leadership, supervision, and inspection, so that the work of the people's tribunals can be carried out smoothly. And lay a better foundation for the future construction of people's judicial work in various places.

### 做好人民法庭工作

　　做好人民法庭工作
    去年冬季以来在一亿五千余万农业人口地区进行土地改革的同时，这些地区的人民政府，依照中央人民政府政务院一九五○年七月二十日公布施行的“人民法庭组织通则”，先后建立了县
    （市）人民法庭及其分庭。据中南、华东、西南三大行政区不完全的统计，共有县（市）人民法庭九七七个，分庭三六九三个。各地人民法庭是在当地人民政府统一领导之下进行工作的，它在业务上受人民法院指导，在处理反革命案件时并受人民公安局指导。人民法庭在土地改革中的主要作用表现在：一、在土地改革的前后及土地改革的全部过程中，在剿匪反霸、减租退押、划分阶级、分配果实、防止地主反攻倒算等斗争中，打击了在农村中长期危害人民与国家利益的恶霸、土匪、特务等反革命分子及违抗土地改革法令的其他罪犯，为土地改革扫清了或减少了障碍。二、协助发动群众，为农民撑腰，鼓舞了群众反封建斗争的勇气。三、教育农民参与并掌握人民民主专政的政权，巩固了农村的革命秩序。因而它也就创造了人民司法建设的一些新的经验。
    今冬明春我国又将有近一亿农业人口的地区进行土地改革，这些地区必须做好人民法庭工作，以适应土地改革运动的发展。所有已经完成土地改革的地区，也必须继续总结人民法庭的经验，并处理土地改革中遗留下来的问题，借以推进人民司法的思想建设并加强人民司法工作。土地改革工作虽然已经完成但需要复查的地区，还必须进一步充实人民法庭的工作。我们必须努力改进人民法庭的工作，使人民法庭在实行土地改革地区成为直接巩固乡村人民民主专政的锐利武器之一，使乡村中广大的农民群众掌握它去打垮一切敌对分子的反动气焰，发挥农民群众斗争的威力。农民自己有了这个武器，也就可以防止不必要的紊乱，就可以防止在热火朝天的反封建斗争中无意地打击了不应该被打击的人，就可以保证顺利地完成土地改革。有的人说：“过去某些老区土地改革时没有人民法庭，还不是一样完成了任务？”有的人以为人民法庭是“可有可无”的。这些意见显然都是错误的。事实证明，人民法庭在土地改革中所起的作用是十分重要的。因此，凡进行土地改革地区的各级人民政府都应认真负责地领导人民法庭的工作；凡进行土地改革地区的各级人民法院更必须以其主要力量来支持与参予人民法庭的工作。
    人民法庭是适应群众土地改革运动的需要而产生的，是支持与推动群众运动的有力工具。因此，人民法庭的工作就必须与土地改革运动密切结合，其建立时间就不宜落在土地改革之后，否则就不能及时地起着发动群众的作用。同时，人民法庭应适应土地改革运动发展的规律，针对着运动发展的各个阶段中反动势力活动的特点和农民的迫切要求，来进行自己的工作，这样才能推动土地改革运动，才能开展法庭的工作。各地人民法庭在土地改革运动中，曾抓住在土地改革的各个时期进行反抗、破坏并为农民群众所痛恨的地主恶霸予以惩处，用以打击敌人气焰和鼓舞群众的斗争情绪，推动了运动向前发展。各级党与人民政府应重视这一经验，要善于使用人民法庭为发动群众、推动运动和巩固胜利的工具。人民法庭工作者更应明确认识自己所应起的作用，更好地为土地改革的群众运动而服务。
    因为人民法庭是带有更广泛的群众性的人民司法机关，是直接联系人民、依靠人民并由人民直接参予的。因此，它在工作中必须强调执行群众路线。人民法庭的审判员，必须是委派与民选相结合的，才能熟悉当地情况，更充分反映群众的意见。从农民群众的优秀分子中，从经过群众革命斗争锻炼的积极分子中选拔一批代表农民的（不是代表其被推选的团体单位）民选审判员和陪审员来参加人民法庭的工作，是十分必要的。这不仅是开辟了人民法庭干部的丰富来源，而且更能发动农民群众直接参予人民法庭的活动。人民法庭的审判方式应是庭审与巡回就审二者相结合的方式。对于重大的有教育意义的案件，在条件具备的情况下，可以实行也应该实行公审。公审时，除动员群众参加外，还可令地主旁听。人民法庭的宣判要能全面体现我人民政府的政策，以发挥镇压敌人与教育群众的作用。人民法庭在审讯手续上应力求简化，但不能不要司法手续，否则，人民法庭的审判就可能与群众斗争会相混淆。我们要反对人民法庭孤立办案和单纯的庭讯。人民法庭在审讯工作中，必须采取严肃谨慎的态度，必须严防草率从事，反对主观武断；必须严禁不重证据、轻信口供和刑讯、逼供等错误作风；必须把系统的侦察、审讯、号召坦白和群众调查等各方面所得的材料加以综合研究，然后作出结论，根据政策法令与群众的正确要求，予以判决。联系群众、依靠群众、实事求是、调查研究是人民法庭工作能正确进行的主要保证。
    为了开展与加强人民法庭工作，每区最好设一个分庭，并应以分庭为审判案件的中心。同时应给人民法庭调配必要的干部。干部的来源应依照“人民法庭组织通则”第四条的规定及各地的经验，即在人民法庭中保持委派审判员和民选审判员各半的原则。委任审判员可从人民法院、人民公安局、土地改革工作队以及其他部门中抽调。其中每个法庭至少要有两三个专职干部，否则，完全是兼职干部，人民法庭将会成为一个空招牌。要广泛地认真使用民选审判员，以克服干部不足的困难。在调配人民法庭干部时，必须选择立场坚定的干部，并严防阶级异己分子混入。在调配的干部参加工作之前，必须加以适当训练，使他们明了人民法庭的任务，懂得掌握政策，并学会人民法庭工作中的群众路线。这种训练可由省、专区和县分别进行。在调配并训练了干部之后，对人民法庭的工作又必须予以经常的领导、督促、检查，使人民法庭工作能够顺利开展。并为今后建设各地人民司法工作打下更好的基础。
