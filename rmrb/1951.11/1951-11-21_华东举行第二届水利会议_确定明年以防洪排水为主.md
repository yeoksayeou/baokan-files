Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 20th: The East China Military and Administrative Committee's Water Conservancy Department held the Second East China Water Conservancy Conference earlier this month. The conference decided that the guiding principle for water conservancy work in East China in 1952 would be to prioritize flood control and drainage, broadly mobilize the masses to build small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, continue to consolidate seawall projects and manage the Yi and Shu Rivers, focus on irrigation projects, selectively dredge waterways, and experimentally establish small-scale hydropower projects.

The conference summarized the water conservancy work in East China in 1951, deeming the achievements significant. Over the past year, in addition to completing the magnificent first-stage project for fundamentally controlling the Huai River, completing the management projects of the Yellow River and Yangtze River in the East China section, the people of East China also managed the Yi and Shu Rivers, reinforced seawalls, and built some small irrigation projects. The total earthwork completed throughout the year amounted to over 170 million cubic meters, over 1.3 million cubic meters of stonework, and over 79,100 various engineering structures. Among them, there were more than 360,000 small-scale farmland water conservancy projects undertaken by the masses themselves, totaling over 114.4 million cubic meters of earthwork and over 292,000 cubic meters of stonework. The completion of the above projects enabled more than 70 million mu of farmland in East China to benefit from irrigation or be spared from waterlogging this year. Southern Shandong Province and the Huaiyin area of northern Jiangsu Province, which were plagued by floods every year, experienced the first bumper harvest in six or seven years on 9.5 million mu of farmland this year. Over the past year, the main shortcomings of water conservancy work in East China were twofold: First, some water conservancy cadres in some areas lacked long-term construction thinking and a holistic perspective, and the engineering plans formulated were not thorough enough, resulting in waste of state funds in the construction of some projects. Second, the tendency to neglect the maintenance of water conservancy projects was relatively common in various places. The conference urged all localities to pay serious attention and correct these shortcomings.

The main water conservancy work in East China next year will be to complete the management of the Yi and Shu Rivers, dredge the navigation channel of the Grand Canal from Tai'erzhuang in Shandong to Hangzhou, and reinforce seawalls. The projects for the three major rivers, the Huai River, the Yellow River, and the Yangtze River, are the responsibility of specialized agencies. The Yi and Shu River management project is planned to be completed before the flood season next year, striving to ensure that the Yi River does not pose a risk at a flood flow of 6,000 cubic meters per second, and the Shu River does not pose a risk at a flood flow of 4,500 cubic meters per second.

In addition, the conference also decided that each province and region should undertake more medium-sized water conservancy projects on their own and encourage the people to undertake more mass-based small-scale farmland water conservancy projects. The People's Government should provide focused assistance to the mass-based water conservancy projects.

### 华东举行第二届水利会议  确定明年以防洪排水为主

    华东举行第二届水利会议
    确定明年以防洪排水为主
    【新华社上海二十日电】华东军政委员会水利部在本月上旬召开了华东区第二届水利会议。会议决定：华东区一九五二年的水利工作方针以防洪排水为主，普遍发动群众兴修小型农田水利工程，继续整理海塘工程和导治沂河、沭河，重点举办灌溉工程，择要整理航道和试办小型水力发电工程。
    会议总结了华东区一九五一年的水利工作，认为工作的成绩很大。一年来，华东人民除完成了规模宏伟的根治淮河的第一期工程，完成了黄河、长江在华东地段的整治工程，并曾导治沂河、沭河，培修海塘和修建了一些小型的灌溉工程。全年完成的工程，土方共一亿七千多万公方、石方共一百三十多万公方，各种工程建筑物共七万九千一百多处。其中群众自办的小型农田水利工程有三十六万多处，合计土方一亿一千四百多万公方，石方二十九万二千多公方。上述工程的完成，使华东区今年有七千多万亩农田得到了灌溉的便利或免除了水涝的灾害。年年遭水灾的山东南部地区和苏北的淮阴专区，今年有九百五十万亩农田得到六、七年来的第一次丰收。一年来，华东区水利工作的主要缺点有两个：一、部分地区的水利工作干部缺乏长期建设的思想和全局观点，制定的工程计划欠周密，因而在有些工程修建中浪费了国家的资财。二、各地忽视水利工程养护工作的偏向比较普遍。会议要求各地严重注意，加以纠正。
    下年度华东区的主要水利工作是完成导治沂河、沭河，整理南运河山东台儿庄到杭州间的航道和培修海塘，淮河、黄河、长江三大河流的工程另有专门机构负责。导治沂河、沭河工程计划在明年汛期前全部完成，争取做到沂河在六千秒公方洪水时，和沭河在四千五百秒公方洪水时不出险。
    此外，会议又决定：各省区应多自办中型的水利工程，并鼓励人民多多举办群众性的小型农田水利工程。对群众自办的水利工程，人民政府应有重点地予以帮助。
