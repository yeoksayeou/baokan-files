    Beijing Film Studio Cadre Chen Zhining
    Forces Tenants to Move, Arousing Public Dissatisfaction
    Tenants Demand the Studio Return Purchased Private Housing
    On the 13th of this month, this newspaper received letters from Ma Baohua, a Beijing tram worker, and Tu Shiliang, a vendor, reflecting that the Beijing Film Studio (hereinafter referred to as Beiying) violated government decisions by forcing tenants to move. The letter stated: “We live at No. 48, Beida Street, Xinjiekou. The landlord’s surname is E. The landlord sold the house to Beiying on September 26th. Beiying cadre Chen Zhining gave us forty days to move. But after a few days, without even notifying us, they started construction, and bricks and soil fell all over the house. We couldn't even cook, and they also removed the electricity meter. A week later, Chen Zhining came again and asked if we had found a house. We replied that we had not. He said angrily: "If you don't move in forty days, I have ways to deal with it." After the People's Government prohibited all organs and groups from purchasing civilian housing, Beiying also threatened us in our daily lives. On November 8th, they even removed the faucet from the water pump, and the next day, they demolished the men's and women's toilets. Lights, water, and toilets are indispensable to our daily lives. Beiying’s actions have made our situation very difficult. We hope you can help resolve this issue quickly.” After receiving the letters from Ma Baohua and Tu Shiliang, this newspaper also received a letter from "A Reader" pointing out that when Beiying bought Ma Huadong's house in Yangquan Hutong, there were housing brokers involved. After the factory learned of the government's decision, instead of implementing it, it used various methods to force residents to move urgently, which is a violation of the government's decision. Based on readers' letters, this newspaper sent people to investigate and contacted Beiying and the Fourth Branch of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Real Estate Exchange (hereinafter referred to as the Fourth Branch), proving that the situation reflected by the readers is true. The facts are reported as follows:

    No. 48, Beida Street, Xinjiekou, Beijing, has a total of seven rooms. The landlord, E Yinghai, lives in four rooms, and the remaining three rooms are rented to tram worker Ma Baohua and vendor Tu Shiliang. This house is adjacent to the Beijing Film Studio canteen. The factory urgently needed to purchase this house because the original canteen was not large enough. On August 21st, the factory obtained approval. On September 26th, both parties signed a contract at the Fourth Branch. On the same day, using the landlord E Yinghai's name, they officially signed a contract to buy thirteen rooms of Ma Huadong's house at No. 6, Yangquan Hutong (with Beiying paying the price of 225 bolts of cloth) as an exchange condition.

    After the house sale contract was signed, Beiying began construction and limited the tenants to move within forty days. However, neither the new nor the old owners made responsible or reasonable arrangements for the tenants, which aroused public dissatisfaction. In order to force the tenants to move out as soon as possible, Chen Zhining, the general affairs clerk in charge of the housing negotiations at Beiying, resorted to unscrupulous means to treat the masses. First, Chen Zhining promised to give 150 kilograms of millet and 50,000 yuan in moving expenses per room, but the tenants did not accept. Chen Zhining then talked to Tu Shiliang, asking him to move to No. 1, Bantoutiao, and promised to give him two beds, two quilts, and 50,000 yuan for cotton. Tu Shiliang refused to move because he knew that the dispute over this house had not yet been resolved (the original owner wanted to mortgage this house to Beiying, but the tenant did not agree, resulting in a dispute, and the case is still pending in the Municipal Court). On November 8th, Chen Zhining led workers and forcibly loaded Tu's furniture and sundries onto rickshaws, causing the Tu family to argue and the children to cry, creating a chaotic scene. At that time, Deputy Director Jia of the Fourth Branch arrived and temporarily settled the situation, preventing the move. Chen Zhining even removed the faucet of the water pump, cutting off the people's water supply; he also removed the electricity meter and demolished the toilets, arousing public dissatisfaction.

    Now the tenants concerned unanimously demand that Beiying strictly implement the government's decision and return the private housing purchased on September 26th to protect their housing issues.

    Editor's Note: The Beijing Film Studio purchased private housing, resulting in an incident where the factory cadre Chen Zhining forced tenants to move. This incident is intolerable.

    The Beijing Municipal People's Government decided at its 84th administrative meeting on October 19th: "No organs, groups, or state-owned enterprises shall purchase, rent, pawn, or borrow civilian housing from citizens; those who purchased, rented, pawned, or borrowed after September 1st shall all withdraw, and the original residents shall continue to live or move back to live..." This is an important measure by the People's Government to solve the urban housing problem.

    Under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the people's city is rapidly recovering and developing in various undertakings, and the population is also increasing rapidly. Therefore, housing construction cannot keep up with actual needs, forming housing difficulties. Various organs, groups, state-owned enterprises, etc., also have various difficulties, but in order to care for the people, abide by laws and discipline, and carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, it is better to live simply and squeeze together, so as not to squeeze out the original residents by purchasing or renting civilian housing. This is the due quality and noble manifestation of serving the people. However, Chen Zhining, a cadre of the Beijing Film Studio, disregarded the decision of the People's Government, ignored the interests of the masses, and forced tenants to move, seriously damaging the prestige of the Party and the People's Government among the masses. This is a reflection of the privileged thinking of the reactionary ruling class in individual cadres and must be resolutely corrected.

    Now, the tenants of the private housing purchased by the Beijing Film Studio unanimously demand that the factory strictly implement the government's decision and withdraw from the private housing purchased on September 26th to protect their residence. This demand is reasonable. The Beijing Film Studio should quickly, in accordance with the decision of the People's Government, immediately withdraw from the purchased private housing. A profound review of this event should be conducted. The factory cadre Chen Zhining should be appropriately punished.

### 北京电影制片厂干部陈治宁  强迫房客搬家引起群众不满  房客要求该厂退回所购民房

    北京电影制片厂干部陈治宁
    强迫房客搬家引起群众不满
    房客要求该厂退回所购民房
    本月十三日，本报收到北京市电车工人马宝华、小贩屠世良反映北京电影制片厂（以下简称北影）违反政府决定强迫房客搬家的来信。该信略称：我们住在新街口北大街四十八号，房主姓鄂。房主于九月二十六日把房屋卖与北影。北影干部陈治宁限我们四十天搬家。但过了几天，也未通知我们就动工修建，拆墙时砖土落了一屋子，我们连饭都不能作，并且把电表也拆走了。再过了一星期，陈治宁又来问我们找着房子没有，我们回答说没有找着，他即生气地说：“如果四十天不搬家，我有相当办法。”在人民政府禁止各机关团体购买市民房屋以后，北影方面，又在日常生活方面威胁我们，于十一月八日竟把压水机的龙头卸走，次日，又把男女厕所拆除。灯、水、厕所都是我们日常生活上不可缺少的东西，北影这样一来，使我们的处境非常困难。我们希望你们能够帮助迅速解决这个问题才好。在马宝华和屠世良来信以后，本报又接到“一读者”的来信，指出北影在买阳泉胡同马化东的房子时，并有房纤从中拉拢。该厂在知道政府决定后，不但不执行政府决定，反用各种办法，让住户急搬，这是违反政府决定的行为。根据读者来信，本报即派人亲往调查，并与北影及北京市人民政府房地产交易所第四分所（下简称第四分所）取得联系，证明读者所反映的情况是真实的。现将事实报道如下：
    北京市新街口北大街四十八号，共有房七间，房主鄂英海住四间，其余三间分租给电车工人马宝华和小贩屠世良。此房与北京电影制片厂食堂相邻，该厂因原有食堂不够用，急需购买此房。八月二十一日，该厂获得批准，九月二十六日，双方遂于第四分所订立契约。同日，并以房主鄂英海出名，正式立约买得阳泉胡同六号马化东的房子十三间（由北影付房价二百二十五匹布），作为交换条件。
    房屋买卖契约订立后，北影即开始了修建工程，并限定房客在四十天内搬家。但新旧业主对房客均未作负责的合理的安置，因而引起群众的不满。为迫使房客早日搬出，北影负责交涉房屋的总务科员陈治宁，竟不择手段地对待群众。首先是陈治宁答应按每间房给一百五十斤小米和五万元的搬家费，房客没有接受。陈治宁又找屠世良谈话，要他搬到板桥头条一号，并答应给他两付床、两条被和五万元棉花钱。屠世良因知此房纠纷尚未解决（原业主欲将此房典给北影，房客不同意，因而发生纠纷，现此案市法院尚未判决），不愿意搬。十一月八日，陈治宁便带领工人，强把屠家的家具、杂物往排子车上装，以致屠家大人吵、小孩哭，闹成一团。当时第四分所贾副所长赶到，才暂时安顿下来，没有搬动。陈治宁竟将该屋的压水机的龙头拆走，断绝群众的水源；还将电表摘下，厕所拆掉，引起群众的不满。
    现在有关房客一致要求北影严格执行政府决定，退回九月二十六日购买的民房，以保障他们的住房问题。
    编者按：北京电影制片厂因购买民房，发生该厂干部陈治宁强迫房客搬家事件。这一事件是令人不能容忍的。
    北京市人民政府于十月十九日第八十四次行政会议上决定：“任何机关、团体、公营企业都不得再向市民购、租、典、借民房；九月一日以后购、租、典、借者一律退出，由原住户继续居住或迁回居住，……”这是人民政府解决城市房屋问题的重要措施。
    人民城市在党和人民政府领导下，各项事业迅速恢复和发展，人口亦随之迅速增加，因而房屋建筑赶不上实际需要，形成了房屋困难。各机关、团体、公营企业等同样也有种种困难，但为了爱护人民，遵守法纪，发扬艰苦奋斗的作风，宁可因陋就简，自己挤一些，免得因购、租民房而挤出原住户，这是为人民服务的应有的品质和崇高的表现。而北京电影制片厂干部陈治宁，竟漠视人民政府的决定，不顾群众利益，强迫房客搬家，严重地损害了党和人民政府在群众中的威信，这是反动统治阶级的特权思想在个别干部中的反映，必须坚决纠正。
    现在，北京电影制片厂所购民房的房客，一致要求该厂严格执行政府的决定，退出九月二十六日所购的民房，以保障他们的居住，这一要求是合理的。北京电影制片厂应迅速按照人民政府的决定，立即退出所购民房。并应对此事件进行深刻检讨。该厂干部陈治宁应受到适当的处分。
