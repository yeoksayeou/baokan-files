    Investigation Report on Qu Yaoli's Cotton High-Yield Achievements and Technical Experience
    Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture
    After the news of Qu Yaoli's high cotton yield in Jie County, Shanxi Province, was published, people across the country were greatly encouraged, but some expressed doubts. In order to thoroughly understand Qu Yaoli's cotton harvest and summarize his high-yield experience, so as to promote these experiences to the broad masses of cotton farmers, and to dispel various doubts, our ministry specially dispatched Deputy Director Zhang Guangju of the Industrial Raw Materials Department in early October, along with the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture's high-yield investigation team, comrades from Pingyuan Province who went to visit, and cadres from units such as the Shanxi Provincial Cotton Improvement Institute, Yuncheng Special Prefecture Agricultural Section, and Yuncheng Farm, to conduct on-the-spot inspections of Qu Yaoli's cotton field harvest and cultivation. They also used methods such as investigation visits and symposiums to summarize his high-yield experiences. The investigation report is published as follows:
        I. Estimation of Actual Harvest Yield
    Qu Yaoli planted 20 mu of cotton this year, and the yields were very high, with the yields of 2 mu being particularly high. We estimated the yields of these 2 mu of high-yield land and the other 18 mu of cotton fields separately.
    First, we checked the number of plants. The method of checking was to adopt the large-area measurement method. In the 2 mu of high-yield land, we counted the number of plants in half a mu (60 feet long and 50 feet wide). The result of the calculation was that there were 3,160 cotton plants per mu. This number is very close to the 3,141 plants per mu calculated by the Hebei Provincial Investigation Team using the random sampling method, and the 3,000 plants per mu measured on the spot by the Yuncheng Farm. We adopted the large-area measurement method, which is more reliable, so we determined that the standard for high-yield cotton fields is 3,160 plants. For the remaining 18 mu of cotton fields, we determined the standard to be 2,944 plants per mu, as measured by Yuncheng Farm and Qu Yaoli.
    Second, we checked the number of bolls per plant. Local cotton farmers are mostly afraid of autumn rain soaking and mildewing the cotton wadding, so they have the habit of picking cotton bolls. When we investigated, most cotton plants had already opened 70 percent of their bolls. There had been cloudy and rainy days several days before the investigation, and many cotton bolls had been picked off, so the number of bolls could not be accurately checked. Although we used a magnifying glass to distinguish the traces of picking and falling bolls, we still felt it was not very reliable. According to the boll counting records of the Yuncheng Special Prefecture Agricultural Section, farm comrades, and Xinhua News Agency reporters on August 25, the average number of bolls per plant in high-yield land was 22.3. The Hebei Provincial Investigation Team calculated the average number of bolls per plant to be 19.9 on September 21 using the random sampling method. For the sake of caution, the calculation standard for high-yield land is an average of 19.9 bolls per plant. As for general cotton fields, after repeated investigation, the calculation standard is 20 bolls per plant.
    Third, we determined the boll weight. We used the random sampling method to collect 40 representative large, medium, and small cotton bolls from cotton fields that had opened 70 percent of their bolls. The first time we used a balance to weigh them, the average was that more than 60 bolls could yield one jin of seed cotton. However, fearing that the water content of the cotton bolls was too high and the calculation was not accurate enough, we placed them on the stove to bake overnight, and then exposed them to the sun for two days. We weighed them again in Taiyuan with a balance, and then re-weighed them again in Beijing with a balance. The results determined that the average weight of each boll in high-yield land was 7.32 fen (500 fen equals 1市斤), and the average weight of each boll in general cotton fields was 6.6 fen (high-yield land received two more top-dressings than general cotton fields, and management was also particularly thorough, so the cotton bolls were relatively large).
    According to the above investigation results, the average number of plants per mu in high-yield land is 3,160, and the average number of cotton bolls per plant is 19.9, so there are a total of 62,884 cotton bolls. The average boll weight is 7.32 fen, and the yield per mu should be 920 jin. The average number of plants per mu in general cotton fields is 2,944, and the average number of bolls per plant is 20, so there are a total of 58,880 cotton bolls. The average boll weight is 6.6 fen, and the yield per mu should be 777 jin.
    (Editor's Note: The above figures are the results of field measurements and may be slightly different from the actual yield. Recently, Qu Yaoli's cotton fields have been completely harvested, and the Shanxi Provincial People's Government Department of Agriculture and Forestry has sent people to weigh and calculate the actual harvest figures. This number will be announced soon.)
    II. Qu Yaoli's Main Technical Experiences
        First, he has mastered a series of farming techniques that conform to scientific principles.
    Preserving moisture and preventing drought to ensure full seedling emergence. His 20 mu of cotton fields are all loamy soil with slight alkalinity and are all irrigated land. The surface layer of the soil often has many hard blocks, and well water contains alkali, so the land cannot be irrigated when cotton is sown. Therefore, he pays great attention to moisture-preserving cultivation techniques. After the cotton harvest, he first harrows the ground to break it up, then deep plows it once, and uses a rake to level it, making the soil loose and containing abundant moisture. In the early spring, as soon as the ground thaws, he spreads a large amount of sheep manure and stable manure, plowing it into the ground once as spring plowing to turn the base fertilizer into the ground. He then harrows the soil blocks to break them up and levels them again, again making the soil ventilated and permeable to light, restoring its vitality. If there is spring rain before sowing, he then cultivates the land (replacing the plow blade with a soil-separating blade, shallowly plowing without turning the soil) one to two times, each time closely followed by harrowing and breaking up the soil to preserve moisture. If the weather is dry, he does not cultivate much, only harrowing before sowing. His land is continuously irrigated in the summer, and there is rain in the autumn. After winter plowing and multiple harrowings, the soil can maintain sufficient humidity. Moreover, because alkaline soil is relatively moist, plowing twice in the spring is very beneficial for improving the soil and does not hinder moisture preservation. He pays close attention to the rational storage of seeds. The seeds selected and retained from the previous year are carefully stored in a ventilated, dry place away from smoke, maintaining the full vitality of the seeds themselves. Before sowing, they are soaked in warm water, and then mixed with human urine and plant ash to promote germination. He always sows at the right time before Grain Rain. His sowing method is very particular. He first uses a plow without a blade to open a ditch about three fingers deep, sows the seeds, and compacts them with his feet so that they are in close contact with the moist soil. Then, he uses a plow with a blade to open a deeper virtual ditch next to the seed ditch, covering the seeds with the moist, fine soil turned over by the plow, and then harrows twice along the ditch to make the soil covering the seed ditch tight and fine, pushing the soil blocks on the ground into the virtual ditch between the rows. In this way, on the one hand, it has the effect of sowing with moisture, and at the same time, the seed ditch is well covered, which can inhibit the rise of alkali in the soil. Even if it rains after sowing, the rainwater can flow into the virtual ditch, avoiding the return of alkali in the seed ditch and affecting seedling emergence. His moisture-preserving and sowing techniques are very good, so he has full confidence in the emergence of cotton seedlings. When the seedlings grow two true leaves, they begin to be thinned, adopting the methods of early thinning, dense seedling retention, and late seedling setting, paying attention to seedling protection, so his cotton fields have very few missing plants.
    Rational irrigation. His irrigation technology is outstanding. Local water wells are only a little more than one zhang deep, and the water source is abundant, but the water contains a considerable amount of alkali. He does not water the cotton before or after sowing until before budding. From the time of budding to the beginning of boll opening, he continuously waters, but the amount of water is not much. Last year, it was dry, and he watered nine times, stopping only after picking the flowers once. This year, there was more rain than last year, so he only watered seven times. The first watering is after Mangzhong, when the cotton seedlings have already budded but are growing slowly and the leaves are drooping. The first watering must not be too much. After the first watering, it is necessary to continuously water frequently, every four or five days, when the color of the ground appears yellowish-white mottled, without waiting for the surface layer to completely dry out, immediately water. After the peaches have formed, water once every eight or nine days. He implements the small furrow flood irrigation method, each time watering only about two cun of water, watering even less when the seedlings are small, and watering slightly more after the peaches have grown large. However, he generally adheres to the principle of controlled light watering (if it rains during the continuous frequent watering period, an appropriate period can be spaced before watering again). This continuous watering continues until all the cotton peaches have set firmly, or when the local rainy season begins.
    His irrigation method is very reasonable: First, not watering during the seedling stage has a "dwarfing seedling" effect, which can promote the full development of the roots and deepen them downward, to ensure that nutrients can be fully supplied during the flowering and boll-setting period, avoiding the phenomenon of boll abscission and prolonged maturity caused by excessive early growth of cotton plants and loose development of branches and stems due to insufficient nutrient supply in the later stage. He pays close attention to the harrowing of cultivated land before sowing and the early and frequent hoeing of seedlings to maintain an appropriate amount of moisture in the soil to maintain the nutrition of the seedlings. His land is alkaline, and the well water also contains alkali, so it is not advisable to water early to prevent alkali from harming the seeds and seedlings. Second, he practices frequent and light watering during the vigorous growth period of cotton. This is in complete agreement with the irrigation principle of cotton planting. Continuous frequent watering with small amounts of water can always maintain appropriate humidity and temperature in the soil, promote the continuous decomposition of nutrients, and make this decomposition even and controlled. Cotton is accustomed to avoiding excessive growth of branches and stems at any time to control the balanced development of the plant and cotton bolls. Too much water will easily cause rampant growth. If the amount of watering is too uneven before and after, causing sudden increases and decreases in nutrient supply, boll abscission is most likely to occur. To adapt to the cultivation habits of cotton, it is necessary to continuously and timely water frequently, but the amount of water each time must be appropriately limited. Alkaline soil is a sandy loam with poor water retention. If a lot of water is irrigated at one time, not only will the cotton plants easily grow rampantly, but it will also cause the groundwater level to rise, increasing the alkalinity of the soil. At the same time, the local summer is dry, hot, and windy, and evaporation is great. The water that is watered is bitter water containing alkali. As the sunlight evaporates, the amount of water in the soil decreases, and the concentration of the soil solution relatively increases. When it increases to a certain degree, it will hinder the absorption of nutrients by plants and affect the growth of cotton. Therefore, it is necessary to water frequently, timely replenish water, dilute the concentration of the soil solution, and wash down the rising alkali to facilitate the normal development of cotton.
    Rational fertilization. This year, he applied six large carts of base fertilizer per mu, totaling about 12,000 jin. The fertilizer he applied was sheep manure and mule and horse manure, which contained relatively complete nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium elements. According to his experience, this kind of fertilizer is "stable and not violent," which can enable cotton plants to develop in a balanced manner without growing rampantly. His land is relatively cold (due to alkalinity and many waterings), so applying "hot" fertilizers (containing more organic matter and undergoing greater fermentation) such as sheep manure and mule and horse manure is beneficial to this kind of soil. He also grasped the timing of fertilization well. He applied a large amount of stable manure as soon as the ground thawed in early spring. This allows the fertilizer to fully decompose and maximize its effectiveness. Moreover, in the process of decomposition, it can increase soil temperature, improve the soil's aggregate structure, increase water retention capacity, and prevent the rise of underground alkali. His high-yield land received an additional 16 jin of ammonium sulfate per mu as top dressing, which was applied in two applications around Mangzhong and Summer Solstice. In the past, because he was afraid of rampant cotton growth, he did not dare to apply fast-acting top dressing during the growing period. This year's experience has proved that applying appropriate amounts of top dressing in stages is essential for high cotton yields.
    Continuous seed selection. Qu Yaoli has been continuously selecting and retaining seeds since he obtained Si Zi No. 4 cotton seeds in 1942. He has a strong ability to distinguish between good and bad seeds. Every year, he selects cotton plants in the field that are not crazy, not weak, free from diseases and pests, and growing normally, and harvests the seeds on the third to fifth fruit branches in the middle, and especially selects cotton bolls with more than five locules (i.e., five petals). After 1950, the People's Government advocated seed selection by particle, and he meticulously carried out seed selection by particle. After nearly ten years of continuous seed selection, he not only maintained the original excellent traits of Si Zi No. 4 cotton, but also improved it to a further level, becoming an excellent variety that is fully adapted to the local natural conditions. Now his cotton seeds have the following three excellent traits: First, the plant shapes are generally neat and strong, without diseased plants. Second, cotton bolls with five locules account for 80%, and those with four locules account for only 20%; the bolls are large, with the average boll weight in high-yield land being over 7 fen, and the larger cotton bolls weighing up to 9.375 fen each. Third, the maturity period is early. In years when the frost period is normal and there is no particularly early frost, there are no frost flowers, and the cotton stalks can generally be removed a few days after Frost's Descent for autumn plowing. His seed selection achievements are not only one of the important factors for his high yield, but also prove an important theory: due to the natural hybridization of cotton and the influence of the growth environment, natural variations are bound to occur. If seed selection can be carried out correctly and continuously, it can not only maintain the excellent qualities of the original variety, but also gradually improve it, so as to create even better new varieties.
    Pay attention to dense planting and meticulous pruning. This year, his cotton seedlings were retained more densely, with an average row spacing of two chi and a plant spacing of one chi, about 3,000 plants per mu (local general cotton fields are only about 2,000 plants), which is one of the important factors for his high yield. This also confirms that the Soviet advanced theory of dense planting can increase production is completely correct. Some local high-yield cotton fields retain 1,800 to 2,000 plants. At first glance, their neatness and the number of bolls per plant are above those of Qu Yaoli's cotton fields, but in total, they are far less than Qu Yaoli's cotton. This proves that under reasonable cultivation management, increasing the number of plants to increase the total number of bolls per mu is an important way to achieve high yields. Because if there are fewer plants, it is very difficult for each plant to maintain 30 bolls if watering and fertilization are slightly improper, or if the climate is slightly out of balance, resulting in slightly more boll abscission. But if two cotton plants are planted on the same area, it is easier for each plant to form more than 15 bolls. His densely planted cotton fields have very compact fruit branches, which also proves that dense planting can also make the plant shape reasonably domesticated. Of course, it cannot be said that his 3,000 plants are the most suitable plant row spacing. Depending on the specific circumstances of the variety, land fertility, and technical conditions, the density can still be increased.
    In the case of abundant manure and frequent watering, he flexibly used meticulous cotton trimming techniques to allow the cotton plants to grow fully while controlling rampant growth and boll abscission. When the first fruit branch at the base sees buds, he begins to roll up his trousers (removing the lower elongated branches and leaves), and then removes the superfluous buds on the stems and fruit branches from bottom to top, protecting the development of young bolls. He believes that the superfluous buds on the stems, especially the basal leaf branches, also have the effect of releasing excess nutrients when the soil is fertile and the cotton plants are growing too vigorously. The superfluous buds on the fruit branches are removed as soon as they are seen. Tipping is generally done before the Beginning of Autumn, leaving 12 to 13 fruit branches and removing the terminal buds as early as possible. Around the Autumn Equinox, when half of the cotton bolls have red spots, if the leaves are too lush, some of the large leaves at the bottom of the main stem are removed (but leaf removal should not be too early to avoid affecting the full development of the cotton bolls and lint). He has mastered the characteristics of pruning technology and can give different treatments to different objects according to specific environments, conditions, and cotton plant development, often just right. This is also the main reason why he can achieve high yields.
    Timely prevention and control of insect pests. His cotton seeds were treated with ceresan, and the cotton fields were winter-plowed, so weeds were often not found in the ground, which is very good for disease and pest prevention. This year, during the cotton growing period, a total of three insect treatments were carried out. The first time, tobacco water was sprayed, the second time, 6% wettable "666" was sprayed, and the third time, cotton oil soap solution was sprayed. The main purpose is to prevent and control cotton aphids, and to eliminate them immediately when they are found. Because the second and third "666" and cotton oil soap can also treat other insect pests, not only were aphids treated, but other insect pests also did not occur. Although cotton bollworms were found in the later stage, the damage was minimal. Timely avoidance of disease and pest damage ensured the achievement of high yields.
    Second, he paid attention to comprehensive improvement of technology, thus giving play to the role of "joint cause mutual complement" (the simultaneous implementation of various yield-increasing factors, complementing each other) and achieving the effect of progressive yield increase.
    The basic reason for Qu Yaoli's high cotton yield is that he paid attention to comprehensive improvement of production. He comprehensively implemented various factors that have a decisive effect on cotton yield increase. He is very familiar with the habits of his cotton land and the laws of cotton growth. He paid attention to grasping all the main yield-increasing links. Because the comprehensive implementation and comprehensive improvement of these yield-increasing technologies achieved the effect of "joint cause mutual complement" progressive yield increase, he was able to break through the general level of current agricultural production and achieve the most outstanding high-yield results. We know that individually improving a certain technology, such as seed selection, fertilization, or irrigation, has its certain yield-increasing effect. However, how much yield-increasing effect can be exerted depends on whether other related factors can play a complementary role. For example, if the selection of excellent varieties is well combined with cultivation management technology, the excellent properties of the cotton seeds can be fully exerted, and the yield-increasing effect will be great. Conversely, even if good cotton seeds are selected, if an unsuitable growing environment is given in terms of cultivation management, not only will production not increase, but it will decrease. Similarly, increasing the application of appropriate fertilizer can increase production, but if irrigation is not added and there is insufficient water, the fertilizer cannot be fully decomposed and the fertilizer effect will not be apparent. Or, if too much water is watered, the supply of nutrients will exceed the normal nutritional needs of the cotton plants, which will cause rampant growth of branches and leaves, resulting in reduced production. Irrigation is also the same. Even if the irrigation is very good, if enough fertilizer is not applied to the soil, then the effect of irrigation will be greatly reduced. If a yield-increasing factor is appropriately combined with other related factors and implemented simultaneously, so that each factor complements each other, then each factor can exert a greater effect than it can produce when implemented alone. In this way, a progressive yield-increasing effect can be obtained.
        Third, he can correctly grasp the inherent connections and contradictions of various yield-increasing factors, so as to achieve rational control and regulation.
    As mentioned above, the realization of high yield is by no means achieved solely by relying on one or several technologies, but must be the result of comprehensive improvement of overall technology. However, the comprehensive implementation of various yield-increasing factors has certain connections and certain contradictions with each other. It is necessary to correctly grasp these inherent connections and contradictions, and to make reasonable adjustments and controls, in order to achieve "joint cause mutual complement" and achieve progressive yield-increasing effects. Qu Yaoli has grasped this aspect very well. For example, the specific conditions in the local area are drought in spring and summer, and the soil contains alkali. If there is a lack of water, it is difficult for the cotton seedlings to grow well. If irrigation is carried out, the well water contains alkali, which is not conducive to seedling emergence and the early development of cotton seedlings. He adopted the method of deep plowing in autumn, frequent harrowing and frequent leveling, and frequent hoeing during the seedling stage to maintain soil moisture and suppress the rise of alkali, achieving the requirements of seedling protection and "dwarfing seedlings." On the other hand, the soil structure of his cotton land is poor, the water retention capacity is weak, and the soil temperature is low. Therefore, he applied a large amount of stable manure and sheep manure as base fertilizer in early spring. These fertilizers contain a lot of organic matter and have great heat, which can improve soil properties, and the fertilizer effect is slow to be released and not easy to lose. However, once a large amount of base fertilizer is applied, if there is sufficient water during the cotton growing period, the decomposition and supply of nutrients will be excessive, which will promote rampant growth of cotton plants. If there is a lack of water, it will be unfavorable to the decomposition and exertion of nutrients, which will also affect the growth of cotton plants. He correctly grasped the irrigation method of frequent watering and light watering, and used timely irrigation and limited water volume to control the rational supply of nutrients, unifying the contradiction between fertilization and irrigation and achieving the normal development of cotton plants.
    According to the soil fertility situation, he implemented topping and pruning. When the soil force seems too strong, or in places where the seedlings are sparsely retained, in order to control the rampant growth of the upper part of the cotton plants, he specially retained a few wood branches (i.e., cotton branches that do not grow cotton peaches) to restrain the development of the top. However, in areas where the soil fertility is appropriate and the cotton seedlings are relatively dense, he does not retain wood branches at all. The work of topping is not mechanically carried out within the same period, but is implemented in conjunction with specific conditions such as fertility, cotton plant density, and development status. He paid attention to individual care in pruning and fertilization, and the watering was also divided into very small plots for irrigation, striving for even and appropriate amounts, so his cotton plants developed very evenly. He carried out all the management work of the cotton fields in accordance with the requirements of high yield and early maturity, and adjusted and controlled the main conditions for the growth of cotton plants at any time, avoiding boll abscission and controlling most of the cotton bolls so that they could all be opened before the frost.
    In short, he paid great attention to grasping the interrelationships and contradictions between the various yield-increasing factors, and strived for appropriate adjustment. His saying is that the implementation of all cultivation techniques must "look at the sky, look at the land, and look at the cotton." Therefore, he was able to adapt to local conditions and reasonably use various yield-increasing technologies, so that the cotton could develop and grow relatively normally throughout the entire growing period, thereby achieving the goal of high yields.
    III. Several Opinions
    Can Qu Yaoli's high-yield technical experience be promoted? How to promote it? We believe that Qu Yaoli's successful experience has universal promotion value and possibility. According to our research and analysis, the most important part of Qu Yaoli's high-yield technology is that he can reasonably and comprehensively implement various major yield-increasing factors and comprehensively improve technology; it is that he has found the basic laws of high cotton yield in the specific practice of planting cotton for many years. When we learn and promote Qu Yaoli's high-yield experience, we believe that: In some areas with the same conditions, some of his specific technologies can be imitated, but the most important thing is to understand the scientific principles of his high yields and find the correct way to strive for high cotton yields in combination with local conditions. This is the basic attitude that should be adopted when learning Qu Yaoli's experience in planting cotton for high yields.
    In order to consolidate and continue to improve high-yield results, we believe that there are still many areas for improvement in Qu Yaoli's cotton planting work. (1) In terms of basic construction: Qu Yaoli's cotton fields are alkaline soil, and the existing water wells are bitter water, containing a considerable amount of alkali. Long-term irrigation will gradually harden and deteriorate the soil quality. If a way can be found to drill wells to find underground springs, deepen the water wells, and use sweet water for irrigation, it will be conducive to soil improvement and can adapt to the necessary irrigation before sowing and during the seedling stage. Also, cotton is a crop that requires deep plowing and multiple hoeings. The existing soil plow can only plow to a depth of four or five cun at most. Hand hoeing for intertillage and weeding is labor-intensive and time-consuming. New-style walking plows should be used to gradually increase the depth of autumn plowing, and horse-drawn intertillers should be used to improve intertillage efficiency. (2) In terms of improving technology: His cotton generally takes eight to ten days from sowing to emergence, and emergence is quite slow, which is very unfavorable for seedling protection in alkaline land. We should further pay attention to rational moisture preservation, moisture maintenance, and seed soaking and germination promotion technology, or try vernalization treatment to speed up the emergence period. The density of seedling retention, the plant spacing can also be reduced to about seven or eight cun, so that the number of plants per mu can be increased to more than 3,500. After increasing the density, we should pay more attention to the combination of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium elements in the fertilizer, increase the application of phosphorus fertilizer, and apply appropriate amounts of fast-acting top dressing in stages during the flowering and boll-setting period. The pruning work should also be carried out more strictly, with no more than 12 fruit branches per plant. We should remove the terminal buds early after retaining enough fruit branches, promote the normal development of the lower fruit branches, and set more cotton bolls, so that the whole plant forms a pagoda shape and can develop compactly. His seed selection work has achieved significant results in terms of high yield and early maturity, but the quality is not uniform enough, which is a shortcoming. In future seed selection standards, in addition to continuing to pay attention to large bolls, early maturity, and high yield, we should also pay attention to excellent traits such as long lint and uniformity. In addition, he is not very vigilant about diseases and pests, has little experience in pest control, and his preparation of medicines and equipment is very poor. In the future, we must strengthen our mental and material preparation to avoid irreparable losses when diseases and pests cause serious damage. (3) In terms of mutual aid groups: The mutual aid group he leads was established not long ago and must continue to be supported and guided to consolidate its organization and further exert the effectiveness of the organization. This is of great importance for continuing to improve his and the group's cotton yield.
    Although the highest cotton field yield created by Qu Yaoli this year has exceeded the average yield of general cotton fields by eight or nine times, this does not mean that the cotton yield has approached the maximum limit. If his cotton planting experience can be scientifically summarized and further improved, the yield per unit area of cotton can still be greatly increased. (Attached pictures)

    曲耀离棉花丰产成绩和技术经验的考察报告
    中央人民政府农业部
    山西省解县曲耀离的棉花获得高额产量的消息发表后，全国人民为之振奋，也有一些人表示怀疑。为彻底了解曲耀离的棉花收获情况，总结他的丰产经验，以便向广大棉农推广这些经验，并豁清各种怀疑，我部特于十月上旬派工业原料司张广居副司长等，协同山西省农业厅丰产调查团、平原省前往参观的同志及山西省棉业改进所、运城专署农业科、运城农场等单位的干部，对曲耀离棉田收获情况及耕作情况，作了实地测察，并以调查访问、开会座谈等方法，总结了他的丰产经验。兹将考察报告发表如下：
        一、实收获量估计
    曲耀离今年种了二十亩棉花，产量都很高，其中有二亩的产量特别高。我们将这二亩丰产地和其他十八亩棉田，分别估计产量。
    首先是清查株数。清查的方法是采取大面积测量法。我们在二亩丰产地中，数了半亩株数（长六十尺，宽五十尺），推算结果，每亩棉株为三、一六○株。这个数字与河北省考察团用随机取样法计算每亩株数为三、一四一株，运城农场的实地测量每亩株数为三、○○○株，都很相近。我们采取的是大面积测量法，可靠性较大，所以确定丰产棉田以三、一六○株为标准。其余十八亩棉田，则确定以运城农场和曲耀离测量的每亩二、九四四株为标准。
    其次是清查每株铃数。当地棉农多怕秋雨浸渍，霉坏棉絮，有摘棉铃习惯。我们考查时，多数棉株已吐絮百分之七十。考察前数日曾有阴雨，许多棉铃已被摘掉，铃数已无法查清；虽用放大镜区别摘铃与落铃的痕迹，但仍觉不很可靠。根据运城专区农业科及农场同志、新华社记者八月二十五日的数铃记载，丰产地每株平均二二·三个铃。河北省考察团九月二十一日用随机取样法计算的结果，每株平均为一九·九个铃。为慎重计，丰产地以每株平均一九·九个铃为计算标准。至于一般棉田，亦经过反复考察，每株以二十个铃为计算标准。
    第三是查清铃重。我们用随机取样法在已吐絮百分之七十的棉田里，采取有代表性的大、中、小三种棉铃共四十个。第一次用天秤称的结果，平均每六○多个铃可摘一斤籽棉。但恐棉铃含水量大，计算不够准确，乃放在灶台上烘烤一夜，又经阳光爆晒两日，到太原用天秤称了一次，回北京后再用天秤复称一次，结果确定丰产地每铃平均重为七·三二公分（五百公分等于一市斤），一般棉田每铃重量为六·六公分（丰产地比一般棉田多施了两次追肥，管理也格外周到，因此棉铃比较大）。
    根据上述考查结果，丰产地每亩按平均三、一六○株，每株平均一九·九个棉铃计算，共有棉铃六二、八八四个；铃重平均为七·三二公分，每亩产量应为九二○斤。一般棉田每亩按平均株数二、九四四株，每株平均二○铃计算，共有棉铃五八、八八○个；铃重平均为六·六公分，每亩产量应为七七七斤。
    （编者按：上述数字，系田间测算结果，可能与实际产量稍有出入。最近曲耀离的棉田已全部收获完毕，山西省人民政府农林厅已派人前往秤量计算实际收获数字，这个数字不久即可公布。）
    二、曲耀离的主要技术经验
        第一、他掌握了一系列合乎科
    学原理的耕作技术。
    保墒防旱，保证全苗。他的二○亩棉田都是带轻碱性的壤土，都是水浇地。土地表层常多硬块；井水含碱，棉花播种时不能浇地。因此，他很讲究保墒的耕作技术。他在棉田收获后，先将地面耙碎，随即深耕一次，用耢耱平，使土壤松软，含蓄丰富的水分。来春刚开冻，即散施大量羊粪、厩肥，春耕一次，把基肥翻入地下，随将土块耙碎耱平，再次使土壤通气透光，恢复活力。如播种前遇有春雨，再耩地（把犁镜换成分土镜，浅耕不翻土）一至二次，每次紧跟着耙耱碎土，保蓄水分；如果天气干旱，则不多耩，仅在临播种前耙耱。他的地在夏季连续浇灌，秋季有雨，经过冬耕多耙，土壤可保持足够的湿度；且因碱土性质比较阴湿，所以春季翻二犁，对改善土壤很有好处，对保墒并无妨碍。他十分注意种籽的合理保存，头年选留的种籽，仔细贮藏在通风、干燥、避免烟熏的地方，保持了种籽本身饱满的生活力。播种前经过温汤浸种，再用人尿、草木灰拌种催芽。他总是在谷雨前适时下种。他的播种方法很讲究，先用不带犁镜的犁开沟约三指多深，播入种籽，用脚踏实，使与湿土紧密接触；再在沟旁用带犁镜的犁另开一较深的虚沟，将犁翻的湿润细土盖在种籽上，然后顺沟耱盖二次，使种籽沟上的覆土紧密细碎，将地面的土块推落在行间的虚沟里。这样，一方面有借墒播种的作用，同时种籽沟覆盖得好，可抑制土内碱分上升；即使播种后遇雨，雨水也可流入虚沟里，避免种沟里返碱，影响出苗。他的保墒、播种技术很好，因此，对于棉田出苗有充分把握。苗长两片真叶时即开始间苗，采用早间苗、密留苗、晚定苗的方法，注意保苗，因而他的棉田缺株很少。
    合理灌溉。他的灌溉技术十分出色。当地水井只有一丈多深，水源充足，但水含碱相当多。他在棉花播种前后，直到见蕾之前，都不浇水。从结蕾以后到开始吐絮期间，连续浇水，但水量不多。去年天旱，浇水九次，到摘过一次花时才停止浇水。今年雨水较去年多，只浇了七次。头水是在芒种以后、棉苗已经结蕾、但生长迟缓、叶有下垂趋向时浇的。头水决不能浇多。浇过头水以后，就要连续勤浇，每隔四、五天看地皮颜色呈黄白花斑状时，不等表层完全干结，就马上浇水，结桃后间隔八、九天浇一次。他实行小畦漫浇法，每次约只浇二寸左右水，苗小时浇的更少些，到桃子结大以后，浇的稍多些；但一般都掌握着有节制的轻浇的原则（如果连续勤浇期间遇着雨，可间隔一适当时期再浇）。这样连续的浇水，直到全部棉桃结牢，或接上当地雨季开始时才停止。
    他的灌溉方法是很合理的：第一、苗期不浇水，有“蹲苗”作用，可促使根部充分发育，向下深扎，以保证开花结铃期能充分供应养料，避免棉株因早期生长过旺，枝干发育松散，后期养料供应不足，而发生落蕾、落铃并延长成熟期的现象。他十分注意播种前对耕地的耙耱和幼苗期的早锄勤锄，保持土壤的适量的水分，以维持幼苗的营养。他的地带碱性，井水中又含碱分，为了防止碱分侵害种芽及幼苗，更不宜早浇水。第二、他在棉花发育盛期，实行勤浇、轻浇，这是完全合于植棉的灌溉原理的。连续勤浇小水，能经常保持土壤中适当的湿度和温度。促进养分的源源分解，并使这种分解均匀而有节制。棉花习性，须随时避免枝干的过分生长，以控制株体和棉铃的均衡发育。如遇过多的水分，养料供应太猛，便易狂长。如浇水量先后太不均匀，使养料供应骤多骤少，最易落蕾落铃。为了适应棉花的栽培习性，必须连续及时地勤浇，但每次水量一定要有适当限制。碱性土壤是保蓄力不强的砂质壤土，如果一次灌水很多，不但棉株容易狂长，且会引起地下水上升，增加土壤的碱性，同时，当地夏季干旱，炎热多风，蒸发作用很大，所浇的水又是含碱的苦水，随着日光的蒸发，土壤里水分减少，土壤溶液浓度便相对增大，增至一定程度，就会阻碍植物吸收营养，影响棉花生长，因此，更需勤浇水，及时补充水分，冲淡土壤溶液的浓度，并将上升的碱分洗压下去，以利棉花的正常发育。
    合理施肥。他今年每亩施基肥六大车，计一二、○○○斤左右。他施的肥料是含氮、磷、钾三要素比较完全的羊粪与骡马粪。据他的体会，这种肥料“性稳不暴”，可使棉株得到均衡的发育，不致狂长。他的地比较阴冷（因含碱和浇水次数多），施用羊粪、骡马粪这类“热性”的肥料（含有机质多，发酵作用大），对此种土壤是有利的。他对施肥时期也掌握得好。早春一开冻立即施下大量厩肥。这样可使肥料充分腐熟，尽量发挥肥效。而且在腐熟分解过程中，可增加土壤温度，改进土壤的团粒结构，增加保水能力，防止地下碱分上升。他的丰产地每亩加施了十六斤硫酸錏作追肥，是在芒种和夏至左近分两次施下的。他过去因为怕棉花狂长，不大敢在生长期间施用速效的追肥，今年的经验已证明，分期施用适量的追肥，对棉花丰产是十分必要的。
    连续选种。曲耀离自一九四二年得到斯字四比棉种后，即连续选种、留种。他对良种、劣种的鉴别能力很强。每年他在田间选择不疯、不弱、无病虫害、生长正常的棉株，单收其中部第三到第五个果枝上的腰花，且特别选收五室（即五个瓣）以上的棉铃。一九五○年后，人民政府提倡粒选棉籽，他又精细地进行了粒选。经过近十年的连续选种，不仅保持了斯字四比棉原有的优良性状，而且使之提高了一步，成为完全适应当地自然条件的一种优良品种。现在他的棉种具备了下述三种优良性状：第一、株形普遍整齐健壮，没有病株。第二、棉铃五室者占百分之八十，四室者仅占百分之二十；铃大，丰产地平均铃重七公分以上，较大的棉铃每个重达九·三七五公分。第三、成熟期早，凡霜期正常，不特别早霜的年头，都没有霜花，一般在霜降后几天即可拔去棉秸进行秋耕。他的选种成绩，不仅是他获得丰产的重要因素之一，而且证明了一个重要的理论：由于棉花的自然杂交以及生长环境的影响，必然发生自然变异，如果能正确地连续不断地选种，不仅能保持原种的优良品性，而且能逐步提高，以至创造出更优良的新种。
    注意密植，精细整枝。今年他的棉花留苗较稠，大约平均行距二尺、株距一尺，每亩三千株左右（当地一般棉田都只是两千株左右），这是他获得丰产的重要因素之一。这同时证实了苏联先进的密植可以增产的理论是完全正确的。当地有些丰产棉田留苗一千八百至两千株，粗看起来，其整齐程度，每株结铃之多，都在曲耀离的棉田之上，但总算起来，远比不上曲耀离的棉花。这就证明在合理的栽培管理下，株数加多，以增加每亩的总铃数，是达成丰产的重要途径。因为株数少了，浇水施肥稍有不当，或气候稍有不调，落蕾、落铃稍多一点，每株就很不容易保持三十个铃。但如果在同样的面积上种两株棉花，每株结成十五个以上的铃就比较容易。他的密植棉田棉株果枝都长的很紧凑，这也证明密植还可使株形合理地驯化。当然不能说他的三千株就是最合适的株行距，视品种、地力以及技术条件的具体情形，密度还是可以增加的。
    在粪大水勤的情况下，他灵活地运用了精细的修棉技术，使棉株得到充分生长，同时又控制了疯长和落铃。当基部第一果枝见蕾时，他就开始捋裤腿
    （把下部的徒长枝及叶去掉），再由下而上去掉茎与果枝上的赘芽，保护幼铃的发育。他认为茎上的赘芽特别是基部的叶枝，在地肥充足棉株生长劲头过大时，留一部分也有宣泄多余养分的作用。果枝上的赘芽是随见随去。打尖一般是在立秋以前，留下十二、三个果枝，及早除去顶芽。秋分前后，棉铃有一半红斑时，如叶片过于茂盛，便摘去一部分主干下部的大叶（但摘叶不可太早，以免影响棉桃和棉绒的充分发育）。他掌握了整枝技术的特点，能依据具体环境、条件和棉棵发育情况，按不同对象给以不同处理，往往恰到好处。这也是他所以能获得丰产的主要原因。
    及时防治虫害。他的棉种曾用赛力散拌种，棉田经过冬耕，地里经常找不到一根杂草，这对病虫的预防工作是做得很好的。今年在棉花生长期间，共治了三次虫，第一次用烟草水喷射，第二次用百分之六的可湿性“六六六”喷射，第三次用棉油皂溶液喷射。主要目的是防治棉蚜，随时发现立即扑灭。由于第二次第三次的“六六六”、棉油皂可兼治其他虫害，因而不仅治了蚜害，其他虫害亦未发生。后期虽发现造桥虫，但为害极微。及时避免了病虫的损害，也就使丰产的成果获得了保证。
    第二、他注意全面改进技术，因而发挥了“联因互补”（各项增产因子同时实施，彼此间相辅相成）的作用，获得累进增产的效果。
    曲耀离获得棉花丰产的基本原因，是他注意了全面改进生产。他把对于棉花增产有决定作用的各项因子，都综合实施了。他十分熟悉他的棉地习性和棉花生育的规律。他注意掌握了所有主要增产环节。因为这些增产技术的综合实施与全面提高，达到了“联因互补”累进增产的效果，所以他能突破当前农业生产的一般水平，获得最突出的丰产成绩。我们知道，单独改进某一项技术，如选种、施肥、或灌溉，都有它一定的增产作用。但其增产成效到底能发挥多少，则要依据其他有关因子能否发挥相辅相成之效而定。例如选种优良品种，如能和栽培管理技术结合的好，棉种的优性便能充分发挥，增产效果也就大；反之，即使选了好的棉种，如在栽培管理方面给予不适宜的生长环境，则非但不能增产，还要减产。又如增施适当肥料可以增产，但如不加灌溉，水分不够，则肥料不能完全分解，肥效便显不出来；或则浇水太多，养分的供给超过棉株正常营养的需要，反会造成枝叶狂长以致减产。灌溉也是一样，尽管灌溉得很好，但如土壤里没有施用足够的肥料，那末灌溉的效用也就大大减少。一个增产因子，如适当地结合了其他有关因子，同时实施，使各个因子彼此相辅相成，则每一个因子都能发挥出比其单独实施时所能产生的更大成效，这样，便能得到累进增产的效果。
        第三、他能正确掌握各种增产
    因子的内在联系和矛盾，做到合
    理的控制和调节。
    上面说过，高度丰产的实现，决不是单纯依靠某一种或某几种技术所能达到的，必然是整体技术全面改进的结果。但各项增产因子的综合实施，其相互间有一定的联系，也有一定的矛盾，必须正确掌握住这些内在的联系和矛盾，加以合理的调剂和控制，才能达到“联因互补”，收到累进增产的成效。曲耀离在这方面是掌握得很好的。例如，当地的具体条件是春夏干旱，土壤含碱，若水分缺少，棉苗很难长好，如果灌溉，则井水含碱，对出苗和棉苗的初期发育都不利。他采用秋天深耕，勤耙、勤耱，苗期勤锄的办法，保持了土壤的湿度，压制碱分上升，达到保苗和“蹲苗”的要求。另一方面，他的棉地土壤组织较差，保蓄力弱，地温较低，因此他早春施用大量的厩肥和羊粪做基肥。这些肥料因有机质多、热力大，能改善土性，肥效发出较慢，不易流失。但一次施下大量基肥，到了棉花生育期间，如果水分充分，养分分解供应便会过盛，将促使棉株狂长；如果水分欠缺，则不利养分的分解发挥，也将影响棉株的生育。他正确地掌握了勤浇、轻浇的灌溉方法，用及时灌溉和限制水量来控制养分的合理供应，统一了施肥和灌溉之间的矛盾，达到棉株的正常发育。
    他根据地肥情况，实行摘心、整枝，在地劲显得太猛时，或在留苗较稀处，为了控制棉株上部狂长，他特地保留少数木枝（即不长棉桃的棉枝）牵制顶部的发展；但在地力适当和棉苗较稠的地段上，他就根本不留木枝。打顶心的工作也不是机械地在同一时期内实行，而是配合肥力、棉株密度和发育状况等具体条件来实施。他在整枝、施肥上都注意个别照顾，浇水也是划成很小的田畦，分片灌溉，力求均匀适量，所以他的棉株发育都很平衡。他对棉田的一切管理工作，都按照丰产早熟的要求进行，随时调节支配棉棵生育的各项主要条件，避免落蕾落铃，并控制大部棉铃，都能在霜前开完。
    总之，他十分注意掌握各个增产因子间的相互联系和矛盾，力求适当调节。他的说法是，一切耕作技术的实施都要“看天、看地、看棉花”，因此，他能够因时因地制宜，合理运用各项增产技术，使棉花在全部生长期都能比较正常地发育成长，从而达到了丰产的目的。
    三、几点意见
    曲耀离的丰产技术经验能不能推广？怎样推广？我们认为：曲耀离的成功经验，有普遍推广的价值和可能。根据我们的研究分析，曲耀离丰产技术的最主要部分，是他能合理地综合实施各种主要的增产因子，全面改进技术；是他在多年植棉的具体实践中，找到了棉花丰产的基本规律。当我们学习和推广曲耀离的丰产经验时，我们认为：在某些条件相同的地区，可以仿效他的某些具体技术，但最主要的是要领会他获得丰产的科学道理，结合当地的具体情况，找出争取棉花丰产的正确途径。这是学习曲耀离植棉丰产经验应具备的基本态度。
    为了巩固和继续提高丰产成绩，我们认为：曲耀离的植棉工作还有许多需要改进的地方。（一）在基本建设方面：曲耀离的棉田是碱性土壤，现有水井是苦水，含碱质相当重，长期灌溉下去，将会使土质逐渐硬结和劣化，若能设法凿井下泉，加深水井，利用甜水灌溉，则既利于土质改良，并能适应播种前和幼苗期必要的灌溉。又，棉花是需要深耕和多锄的作物，现有土犁最深只能耕到四、五寸，用手锄中耕除草则费工费时，应该改用新式步犁，逐步增加秋耕深度，并采用马拉中耕器，增进中耕效能。（二）在改进技术方面：他的棉花从播种到出苗，一般要经过八天到十天时间，出苗相当慢，这对于碱地保苗很不利，应进一步注意合理保墒、养墒和浸种催芽技术，或试行春化处理，加快出苗期。留苗的密度，株距还可缩小到七、八寸左右，使每亩株数增加到三千五百株以上。增加密度以后，更要注意肥料里面氮、磷、钾三要素的配合，增施磷质肥料，并应在开花结铃期，分期加施适量的速效追肥，整枝工作也要更加严密地进行，每株果枝不要超过十二个，留够果枝便早去顶芽，促使下部果枝正常发育，多结棉铃，使全株形成宝塔形，能紧凑发展。他的选种工作在丰产早熟方面，已有显著成效，但品质不够整齐，是一缺点；以后选种标准，除继续注意铃大、早熟、丰产外，还应注意绒长，整齐等优良性状。此外，他对病虫害的警惕性不高，治虫经验不多，药械的准备也很差，今后必须加强精神上和物质上的准备，以免病虫严重为害时，遭到无可挽救的损失。（三）在互助组方面：他领导的互助组成立不久，须继续加以扶植和指导，巩固其组织，更进一步发挥组织起来的效能，这对于继续提高他和全组的棉花产量，是有着重大关系的。
    曲耀离今年创造的最高棉田产量，虽然已经超过一般棉田平均产量八、九倍，但这并没有表示棉花的产量已接近最高限度，如能将他的植棉经验加以科学总结，再求改进，棉花的单位面积产量，还是可以大量增加的。（附图片）
