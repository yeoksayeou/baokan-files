Grammar and Rhetoric Talk (Lecture 6)
    Lü Shuxiang, Zhu Dexi
           Fourth Section: The Colon

    The function of the colon. The colon also indicates a relatively large pause within a sentence, mainly used to introduce what follows or summarize what precedes. For example:
    (1) I mentioned three aspects above: not emphasizing the study of the current situation, not emphasizing the study of history, and not emphasizing the application of Marxism-Leninism. (Mao)
    (2) Our comrades must understand a truth: The proportion of Communist Party members to non-Party members is always a minority, no matter when. (Mao)
    (3) The first crime of Party jargon is: full of empty talk, devoid of substance. (Mao)
    (4) The fourth article of the Goods Tax rate is as follows:
            I. Tobacco:
        (I) Cigarettes: (A) Machine-made or semi-machine-made cigarettes: Ad valorem tax of 100%.
                         (B) Hand-made cigarettes: Ad valorem tax of 80%.
                         (C) Cigars: Ad valorem tax of 100%. (Piece)
    (5) Dropping beetles from airplanes, throwing tangerines from trucks, and asking questions at press conferences not directly but in a distorted way: this represents the consistent style of imperialists at this stage. (Feng Zhi)
    (6) He left immediately: he was going to a refugee relief meeting. (Zhang Tianyi)
    (7) The shopkeeper also stuck his head out, saying, "Kong Yiji?
      You still owe nineteen coppers!" (Lu)
    (8) Our practice proves: we cannot immediately understand what we have sensed; only what we have understood can we sense more profoundly. (Mao)
    (9) Comrade So-and-so: (Letter)
    (1) is a general introduction of three items, with subsequent elaboration. (2) is a single item introduction, with further explanation. (3) is the same, but with an extra "is" word. (4) The colons after "as follows," "tobacco," and "cigarettes" all introduce general categories followed by specific items, functioning the same as (1). The colons under items (A), (B), and (C), from the perspective of each line's internal relationship, are single-item introductions followed by single-item elaborations, like (2); however, this is because the three items are parallel, hence the use of colons for each. If there were only one item, it wouldn't necessarily require a colon (any symbol could be omitted), so it's not entirely the same as (2). (5) is a specific introduction followed by a summary, the opposite of (1).

    (6) The second half of the sentence explains the first half, but not explaining a specific word in the preceding text (such as "situation," "truth," or "crime"). These two clauses are not only structurally independent, but also relatively complete in meaning, differing from the previous examples. It is somewhat similar to examples (4) and (5) of the semicolon. In fact, writers have different preferences; some would use a colon there, while others would use a semicolon. However, upon closer examination, the current form is better, as the first half of the sentence relies more on the second half for explanation.
       (7) and (8) the colon calls the reader’s attention to what is being said, and what is being proven. In this kind of place people often also use a comma. Generally speaking, when the following text is rather long (especially when starting a new line after the word "say"), it is appropriate to use a colon. When the following text is short, a comma can be used. Words like "prove", "show", "point out", "admit" and so on often have no symbol after them; words like "say" and "ask" (especially where there are no quotation marks below) can also have no symbol. For example:
    (10) This once again proves that the US side has no sincerity in resuming negotiations. (Newspaper)
    (11) I asked him if he knew, and he said he didn't know.
    (9) The colon is used at the beginning of the letter to attract attention. When speaking, the greeting "Chairman, Comrades" is recorded using a colon, but an exclamation mark is also used.

    In summary, the colon's main purpose is to introduce what follows, which can be divided into two categories: 1. Presenting a term for further explanation; 2. Drawing the reader's attention to what follows. Only (5) and (6) do not fall into this range. It is called a "colon" because of its primary use.

    Can the colon be used? The colon is often used inappropriately. The most common is after the word "say." There is a misconception that a colon must be added after the word "say." For example:
    (12) Hmph, dare I shamelessly say: "My thinking has been straightened out?" (Newspaper)
    (13) Old Wang didn't have time to explain to him, but only said: "Look!" and ran away. (Work)
    (14) When the factory launched a patriotic labor competition, they threatened the workers, saying: "Our machines are too old, be careful of accidents!" in order to obstruct the development of the competition. (Newspaper) In these three sentences, the colon is correctly used after the word "say"; however, when there are words closely related to the above in the quoted words, a colon cannot be used because a colon represents a greater pause, separating the context. As in (12), the word "吗 (ma)?" cannot correspond to the word "敢 (dare)", almost becoming "My thinking has been straightened out?"
    In (13), the word "就 (jiu)" corresponds to the word "只 (only)," so a colon cannot be used to separate them. In (14), the word "以 (in order to)" also needs to connect with the previous text. In (12) and (13), the colon should be removed: (14) can be changed to "Threaten workers with words like 'Our machines are too old...' to obstruct the development of the competition."
    (15) Meng Xiangying went door to door to persuade them, saying, "You won't die if you eat it," saying, "There won't be wild vegetables to pick after autumn," saying, "Wild vegetables and chaff are better than eating pure chaff," ... (Education) If only one "say" is used in this sentence, a colon can be used; now several "say" are used to introduce several sentences, only commas are used in the middle to separate them, while colons are used inside each part, which is inappropriate. It should be changed to commas.
    (16) The collapse of the bloody plan to provoke a new war, which is to say: the peaceful end of the Korean incident, is seen as a threat by the US interventionists and their obedient slaves. (Newspaper)
    (17) At eleven, he herded pigs for the landlord Lao Zhang's family in Baichengzi; at thirteen, in his own words: "He was promoted," to herding horses for Lao Zhang's family. (Book) "Which is to say" and "In his own words" are inserted phrases, and the structure above and below it is continuous, so there is no reason to interrupt it with a colon after the word "say." It should be a comma.
    (18) Therefore, the patriotic feelings in "Mother"... are still as Belinsky said: "Because we love our motherland, we hate our dark system even more, and long for the light of our motherland." This kind of feeling. (Newspaper) The quotation in this sentence is an appositive, not a paragraph in itself. There is no reason to use a colon before it, and it is even more unreasonable to use a period at the end. Both should be removed.

    (19) But the instructor's words: "How did the Red Army's 25,000-mile Long March go? Could it be said that we are more bitter and difficult today than they were? Chairman Mao said: They got up from the ground, wiped the blood off their bodies, buried the bodies of their companions, and they continued to fight!" educated him, Yuan platoon leader's glorious death educated him, and the comrades' friendship encouraged him. (Newspaper) A colon is acceptable after the word "words" (compare example 2's "truth"); however, since there is "educated him" after the quotation, a colon cannot be used. This sentence should remove the colon and change the pair of quotation marks to a pair of dashes.
    There are also inappropriately used colons after verbs similar to "say." For example:
    (20) At the time, no one thought: Guo Fu was a girl. (Periodical)
    (21) Thus showing the good side of intellectuals, illustrating: they are generally able to make progress. (Newspaper)
    (22) This year's National Health Conference in July clearly established: the general health policy of prevention first, treatment second. (Periodical)
    (23) According to statistics at the end of April, the number of signatories: Bulgaria has reached more than 5.4 million; Hungary has reached 6.8 million; Romania has reached 6.64 million. (Newspaper) (20) and (21) do not require special prompts. (22) If there is only "prevention first, treatment second," a colon can be used; but with "the general health policy" below, it cannot be used. (23) "According to statistics at the end of April" is also an inserted phrase here, inserted between the subject and the verb. Only a comma can be used after "statistics." (Both semicolons can also be changed to commas.)

    Here are more examples of misunderstanding the colon's prompting function and not taking the specific situation into account:
    (24) In Warsaw, I watched two dramas: "Doctor", "Hero" and a song and dance drama "Karakasan People". (Periodical)
    (25) A group of high-ranking commanders of the North Atlantic invading forces were appointed on March 20. Including the Supreme Commander "Chief Assistant": British Field Marshal Montgomery, "Air Force Assistant": British Air Force Chief General Sanders. (Newspaper)
    (26) The places visited in the five provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai and Xinjiang: including Chang'an, Gaolan, Jiuquan, Hami, Dihua... (omitted)... Pingliang and other more than 30 places, the journey is about 30,000 miles. (Newspaper)
    (27) Liaison officers themselves should also help glorious families as much as possible, for example: accompany them to see movies, visit parks, chat, and try to relieve their spiritual loneliness as much as possible. (Periodical)
        (28) (1) The formation process of this group:
    In order to convey the central people's government and Chairman Mao's deep concern for ethnic minority compatriots across the country, to publicize the national policies in the Common Program passed by the People's Political Consultative Conference... (Newspaper) If (24) were just "I watched two dramas: 'Doctor', 'Hero'", (25) were just "Supreme Commander 'Chief Assistant': British Field Marshal Montgomery" and "'Air Force Assistant': British Air Force Chief General Sanders", (26) were just "Visiting places in the five provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai and Xinjiang: Chang'an, Gaolan, Jiuquan...", then these colons would all be used correctly. But now, involving the context "and a song and dance drama", "including", "including", "journey about 30,000 miles", the colon is no longer usable. (24) should be changed to "two dramas," "Doctor" and "Hero"; a song and dance drama, "Karakasan People". (25) and (26) should remove the colon. (27) A colon is often used after "for example," but generally when listing items more formally (especially when listing in separate rows); now there are three "ya" characters indicating a very relaxed tone, followed by "try to achieve...", this clause is beyond the power of "for example," so the colon must be removed. (28) According to general practice, punctuation marks are not added at the end of a title on a separate line (except for question marks and exclamation points).

    The colons in the following three sentences are used inexplicably:
     (29) In the early spring season: the ground has just thawed, and the troops are actively developing the water diversion river. (Newspaper)
     (30) Also: in the old society, everyone was forced to tell lies. (Newspaper)
      (31) Therefore: I think it is wrong to vulgarize the military emblem as a trademark. (Letter) Judging from the above examples, the general tendency is to use colons where they cannot be used. Is there a opposite situation? very few. Here is an example:
    (32) This means that the Labour government's policy of forcing actual wages to fall further and further despite the devaluation of the pound by a third last September and the subsequent rise in prices has gone bankrupt. (Newspaper) A colon should be added after "means" in this sentence. Originally, it could be omitted, but since there is an indispensable comma below, it must be used. Otherwise, readers will definitely think that the object of "means" is "...the policy" when reading it for the first time, and will not know that it is "...the policy has gone bankrupt."

    In addition, many people are not familiar with the two colon usages represented by examples (5) and (6) (perhaps misled by the name "colon"), so using commas or semicolons in these types of sentences is not as appropriate as using colons. (End of this section, the full text is not finished)

    语法、修辞讲话（第六讲）
    吕叔湘、朱德熙
            第四段  冒号
    冒号的作用。冒号也是表示句子内部的比较大的停顿的，主要是用来提起下文或总结上文。例如：
    （一）上面我说了三方面的情形：不注重研究现状，不注重研究历史，不注重马列主义的应用。（毛）
    （二）我们的同志必须懂得一条真理：共产党员和党外人员的比例，无论何时都是占少数。（毛）
    （三）党八股的第一条罪状是：空话连篇，言之无物。（毛）
    （四）第四条货物税税率如左：
            一、烟类：
     （一）卷烟：（甲）机制半机制纸烟：从价征收百分之一百。
                        （乙）手工制纸烟：从价征收百分之八十。
                        （丙）雪茄烟：从价征收百分之一百。（件）
    （五）从飞机里投掷甲虫，从卡车里抛出蜜橘，在记者招待会上不从正面而只是歪曲地提问题：这代表着帝国主义者在现阶段上一贯的作风。（冯至）
    （六）他立刻就走：他要到难民救济会去开会。（张天翼）
    （七）掌柜也伸出头去，一面说：“孔乙己么？
      你还欠十九个钱呢！”（鲁）（八）我们的实践证明：感觉到了的东西，我们不能立刻理解它，只有理解了的东西才更深刻地感觉它。（毛）
    （九）某某同志：（信）
    （一）是总提三项，以下分承。（二）是单提一项，下加说明。（三）同，多一“是”字。（四）“如左”“烟类”“卷烟”下面的冒号都是总提分承，作用跟（一）相同。（甲）（乙）（丙）三项底下的冒号，从每一行的内部关系说，是单提单承，跟（二）相同；但这是因为三项并列才各用冒号的，如果只一项，不一定非用冒号不可（可以不用任何符号），所以又跟（二）不完全相同。（五）是分提总结，跟（一）刚相反。
    （六）下半句说明上半句，但不是说明上文的某一个词（如“情形”“真理”“罪状”）。这两个分句不但结构上各自独立，意义上也各自相当完整，跟前面几个例子不同，倒是跟分号的（四）（五）两例有点相似。实际上，作家们各有所好，有人会在那里用冒号，也有人会在这里用分号。不过细细辨别起来，是现在的样子较好，这里的上半句倚赖下半句说明的程度较高。
        （七）和（八）的冒号提起读者的注意，要他留神“说”的是什么，“证明”的是什么。这种地方，也有人常常用逗号。一般地说，下文相当常的（尤其是“说”字之后另起一行的），宜于用冒号，下文短的可以用逗号。“证明”“表示”“指出”“承认”等等之后还常常不用符号；“说”和“问”之类（尤其是下面没有引号的），底下也可以不用符号。例如：
    （十）这又一次证明美方对于恢复谈判毫无诚意。　（报）
    （十一）我问他知道不知道，他说不知道。（九）的冒号用在书信的开头，用来提起注意。说话的时候，先招呼“主席，各位同志”，记录下来也用冒号，可是也有用感叹号的。
    总起来说，冒号的主要用处是提起下文，又可以分做两类：一，提出一个词语来供下文说明；二，提起读者对于下文的注意。只有（五）和（六）不属于这个范围。所以称为“冒号”，就是它的主要用途而言。
    能不能用冒号？冒号也常常有用得不妥的。最常见的是“说”字的底下。有这么一种误解：用到“说”字就必须在底下加个冒号。例如：
    （十二）哼，我敢大言不惭地说：“我的思想已经搞通了”吗？（报）
    （十三）老王来不及给他解释，只说了一声：“你看吧！”拔脚就跑走了。（作）
    （十四）当该厂展开爱国主义劳动竞赛时，他们就恐吓工人说：“咱们的机器可太老，当心出事故！”以阻挠竞赛的开展。（报）这三句在“说”字后面用冒号，本来是对的；但是在所引的话底下又有跟上面密切关联的词语，就不能用冒号，因为冒号代表较大的停顿，把上下文隔断了。如（十二），“吗”字就不能跟“敢”字呼应，几乎变成“我的思想已经搞通了吗？”了。
    （十三）的“就”字是跟“只”字呼应的，也不能用冒号隔断。（十四）的“以”字也需要跟上文衔接。（十二）（十三）应该去掉冒号：（十四）可以改做“就拿‘咱们的……’这种话来恐吓工人，以阻挠竞赛的开展”。
    （十五）孟祥英挨门挨户劝她们，说：“死不了还得吃，”说：“过了秋天想采野菜也没有了，”说：“野菜和糠总比吃纯糠好，”……（教）这一句如果单用一个“说”字，是可以用冒号的；现在连用几个“说”字引进几句话，当中只用逗号隔开，而每个部分的内部倒用冒号，又就不合适了。应该改做逗号。
    （十六）挑拨新战争的血腥计划的崩溃，从而也就是说：朝鲜事件的和平结束，在美国干涉者及其顺从的奴隶看来，是一种威胁。（报）
    （十七）赶十一岁，他给白城子一家地主老张家放猪；十三岁，用他自己的话来说：“官升了一级”，给老张家放马了。（书）“也就是说”和“用他自己的话来说”都是插进去的短语，它的上面和下面的结构是连贯的，没有理由在“说”字底下用冒号把它打断。应该用逗号。
    （十八）所以“母亲”里的爱国主义的感情……还是如柏林斯基所说的：“因为我们爱祖国，我们就更憎恨我们的黑暗制度，渴望祖国的光明。”的这种感情。（报）这一句的引文是附加语，本身不成段落，前面用冒号毫无道理，底下用句号尤其不通。都应该取消。
    （十九）但是指导员的话：“红军二万五千里长征是怎么走的呢？难道说我们今天比他们更苦更艰难吗？毛主席说：他们从地上爬起来，擦干净身上的血迹，掩埋好同伴的尸首，他们又继续战斗了！”教育了他，袁排长光荣的死教育了他，同志们的友爱鼓舞了他。（报）在“话”字后面用冒号是可以的（比较例二的“真理”）；可是引文之后有“教育了他”，就不能用冒号了。这句应该取消冒号，同时把一对引号改做一对破折号。
    类似“说”字的动词之后也有同样的用得不妥的冒号。例如：
    （二十）当时谁也没想到：郭富是个女孩子。（期）
    （二一）从而表现了知识分子的好的一面，说明了：他们一般地是能够进步的。（报）
    （二二）今年七月全国卫生会议，就明确的订出：以预防为主，治疗为辅的总卫生方针。（期）
    （二三）签名人数，据四月底的统计：保加利亚已达五百四十余万人；匈牙利已达六百八十万人；罗马尼亚已达六百六十四万人。（报）（二十）和（二一）都是没有特别提示的必要的。（二二）如果只有“以预防为主，治疗为辅”，可以用冒号；下面有了“的总卫生方针”，就不能了。（二三）“据四月底的统计”在这里也只是一个插语，插在主语和动词中间，“统计”的后面只能用逗号。（两个分号也都可以改用逗号。）
    误解冒号的提示作用而不照顾具体情况的例子还有：
    （二四）在华沙，我看过两个话剧：“医生”、“英雄”及一个歌舞剧“卡拉卡山人”。（期）
    （二五）在三月二十日任命了一批北大西洋侵略军的高级指挥官。其中包括最高统帅“主要助理”：英国陆军元帅蒙哥马利，“空军助理”：英国空军总监桑德斯上将。（报）
    （二六）在陕、甘、宁、青、新五省中访问的地点：计有长安、皋兰、酒泉、哈密、迪化……（中略）……平凉等三十余处，行程约三万余里。（报）
    （二七）联络员本身也尽可能的对光荣家属进行帮助，例如：陪她们去看电影呀，游公园呀，谈天呀，尽量的做到能解除她们精神上的寂寞。（期）
        （二八）（一）本团组成经过：
    为了传达中央人民政府、毛主席对全国少数民族同胞的深切关怀，宣传人民政治协商会议通过的共同纲领中的民族政策……（报）假如（二四）只是“我看过两个话剧：‘医生’、‘英雄’”，（二五）只是“最高统帅‘主要助理’：英国陆军元帅蒙哥马利”和“‘空军助理’：英国空军总监桑德斯上将”，（二六）只是“在陕、甘、宁、青、新五省中访问地点：长安、皋兰、酒泉……”，那末，这些冒号都用得很对。但是现在牵连着上下文“及一个歌舞剧”“其中包括”“计有”“行程约三万余里”，冒号就用不上了。（二四）应改为“两个话剧，”“医生”和“英雄”；一个歌舞剧，“卡拉卡山人”。（二五）和（二六）应取消冒号。（二七）“例如”之后本来常用冒号，但一般是在较正式地列举项目的时候（尤其是分行列举的时候）；现在有三个“呀”字表示很轻松的口气，接下去又有“尽量的做到……”，这个分句是“例如”的力量所不及的，就非把冒号取消不可了。（二八）按一般的习惯，单独一行的标题之末是不加标点符号的（除问号和感叹号）。
    下面三句的冒号用得莫明其妙：
     （二九）在初春的时节：地皮刚刚解冻，部队就积极的开发引水河。（报）
     （三十）还有：在旧社会里，人人都被迫要说假话。（报）
      （三一）因此：我认为把军徽作为商标的庸俗作法是不对的。（信）照以上这些例句看来，一般的偏向是在不能用冒号的地方用冒号。有没有相反的情形呢？很少。下面是一个例子：
    （三二）这就意味着工党政府不顾去年九月英镑贬值三分之一和继之而来的物价不断上涨而强使实际工资日益降低的政策，已经沦于破产。（报）这一句应该在“意味着”底下加个冒号。本来是可以不用的，底下有了个必不可少的逗号，就非用不可了。否则读者第一遍读下去，一定以为“意味着”的宾语就是“……的政策”，不知道是“……的政策已经沦于破产”。
    此外，（五）（六）两例所代表的两种冒号用法许多人还不熟习（也许误于“冒号”这个名称），因此有在这类句子里用逗号或分号的，都不如冒号恰当。　（本段完，全文未完）
