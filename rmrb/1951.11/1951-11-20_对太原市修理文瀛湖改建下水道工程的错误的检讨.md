    Examination of Errors in the Taiyuan City Repair of Wenying Lake and Reconstruction of Sewer Project

    Editor: The People's Daily published Comrade Chunxun's letter "Failure of the Taiyuan Wenying Lake Renovation Project" in the readers' letters column on September 21st. We believe that the repair of Wenying Lake and the reconstruction of the sewer project in our city had problems in both design and construction. We have already had the Construction Bureau conduct a review at the Taiyuan City People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee meeting and the third second session of the All Circles People's Representative Conference. We are sending a copy of the Construction Bureau's review, please publish it. Taiyuan Municipal People's Government

    Review by the Construction Bureau of the Taiyuan Municipal People's Government

    Our bureau had problems in both design and construction in the repair of Wenying Lake and the reconstruction of the sewer project. As a result, it was not completed as planned, and rainwater also flooded the Sansheng Temple.

    The design flaws are: (1) The digging of sludge and the calculation of sludge transportation were not based on thorough investigation and research, so the project cost exceeded the budget, and additional budget had to be added midway, which resulted in the project not being fully completed as expected. (2) Because the planned construction of sewers in the eastern half of the city has not been fully realized, and the original sewer of Wenying Lake was blocked this time, all the rainwater in the eastern half of the city can only flow out of the city through the Sansheng Temple sewer; thus, the sewer will inevitably be unable to accommodate it. In this case, we did not actively come up with temporary remedies, which caused Sansheng Temple to suffer from flooding.

    In addition, there were also errors in the construction procedure, which prevented other projects from being completed earlier and increased the burden on the Sansheng Temple sewer.

    These errors and problems caused losses in the project and flooding in Sansheng Temple. This was caused by the carelessness of the leading cadres of the Construction Bureau and the empiricism of the engineering and technical personnel in their work. We must be determined to correct them in the future and strengthen our learning.

    In addition, we believe that the environmental sanitation of the People's Park has been basically improved. Because not only was the stinky water drained and the sludge was dug out (a total of 17,276 cubic meters of sludge was dug out, leaving only about 500 cubic meters), and replaced with clear water; the most important thing is that the usual underground stinky water in the eastern half of the city can no longer flow into the lake, fundamentally blocking the source of sludge and stinky water.

### 对太原市修理文瀛湖改建下水道工程的错误的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    对太原市修理文瀛湖改建下水道工程的错误的检讨
    编辑同志：人民日报九月二十一日读者来信栏发表了春旬同志“太原文瀛湖整修工程失败”的来信。我们认为我市修理文瀛湖改建下水道的工程，在设计与施工上都是有毛病的。我们已着建设局在太原市各界人民代表会议协商委员会会议上及第三届第二次各界人民代表会议上作了检讨。兹将建设局的检讨寄上一份，请发表。　太原市人民政府
    太原市人民政府建设局的检讨
    我局在修理文瀛湖改建下水道的工程中，设计与施工上都是有毛病的。因之，没有按计划全部完成，并且雨水还淹了三圣庵。
    在设计上的毛病是：（一）掏挖污泥和计算拉运污泥时，没有经过周密的调查研究，所以工程费超过，中途不得不追加预算；使预计要作的工程，没有全部完成。（二）由于东半城计划兴建之下水道，尚未全部实现，再加这次又堵塞了文瀛湖的原有下水道，这就使得东半城的全部雨水，只有经过三圣庵一条下水道才能流出城外；如此，该下水道必然不能容纳。在这种情况下，我们又没有积极想出临时补救办法，致使三圣庵遭受水患。
    此外，在施工程序上也有错误，致使其他工程未能早日完成，加重了三圣庵下水道的负担。
    这些错误与毛病，使工程上遭到了损失，三圣庵遭受了水患。这是建设局领导干部在工作中的粗枝大叶和工程技术人员的经验主义所造成的。我们今后必须下决心予以纠正，加强我们的学习。
    另外，人民公园的环境卫生，我们认为基本上还是改善了的。因为不仅抽出臭水，挖了污泥（共挖了污泥一七、二七六立方公尺，约仅剩下五百立方公尺），换成清水；最主要的是东半城平时的地下臭水，再不能流入湖内了，根本上堵塞了污泥、臭水来源。
