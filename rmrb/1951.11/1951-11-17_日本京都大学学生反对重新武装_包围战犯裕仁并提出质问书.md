　　Kyoto University Students in Japan Oppose Rearmament
    Surround War Criminal Hirohito and Present Letter of Inquiry
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] News: Approximately one thousand students from Kyoto University in Japan, on the 12th, when the Emperor Hirohito "inspected" the university, they broke the militarist taboo of the so-called "inviolability of the Emperor," held up placards with slogans opposing the separate peace treaty with Japan and the US-Japan "Security Treaty," surrounded Hirohito's car, and presented him with a public letter of inquiry opposing the rearmament of Japan. School authorities summoned two hundred policemen to forcibly disperse the students. Hirohito took advantage of this opportunity and left Kyoto University in a disgraceful manner. Afterwards, the students held a gathering, condemning the reactionary measures of the school authorities in using the police to suppress the students.

　　日本京都大学学生反对重新武装
    包围战犯裕仁并提出质问书
    【新华社十六日讯】东京消息：日本京都大学学生约一千人，于十二日当日皇裕仁到该校“巡视”时，他们打破了所谓“天皇神圣不可侵犯”的军国主义禁律，高举写着反对单独对日和约和美日“安全条约”字样的标语牌，包围了裕仁的座车，并向他提出反对日本重新武装的公开质问书。学校当局召来了二百名警察，强行驱散学生。裕仁趁着这个机会，狼狈地离开了京都大学。事后，学生举行集会，谴责学校当局利用警察镇压学生的反动措施。
