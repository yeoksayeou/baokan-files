    "Ren Ci Tang" Imperialist Elements Cruelly Abuse Workers

    Editor: My name is Song Guifen, and I am from Xushui County, Hebei Province. I have been at "Ren Ci Tang" for nine years. My job is to cook for the children in the main kitchen. Our lives are extremely bitter. We have three meals a day. Breakfast is a bowl of thin gruel, so thin you can't even see a grain of rice. Lunch is a bowl of millet rice and two half-cooked steamed buns. Dinner is again thin gruel. The vegetables are foul-smelling soup. My monthly salary is 4,000 yuan, which is only enough to buy a pair of bad socks. We don’t have enough clothes to wear. In the winter, there are no cotton-padded clothes, and they don't provide any heat. When we ask them for cotton-padded clothes, they refuse. We are never full, so sometimes we secretly buy 500 yuan worth of mixed noodles outside. They make us clean the rooms, and we even have to pay for the brooms ourselves. I used to wash clothes for the imperialist elements in the laundry room. The clothes were all white. Each time, I had to wash forty or fifty pieces of clothing. They only gave us one bar (two small pieces) of soap to wash all these clothes. If they were not washed clean enough, we would be scolded. They treat us workers worse than dogs. Their dogs eat bread, stewed meat, and white rice every day. Of course, they eat even better themselves. Because I couldn't earn enough money to support my family, I brought my child here. My child has really suffered here. No one asks about us when my child and I are sick. We have to greet them with smiles every day, but they are arrogant and indifferent. During the New Year, we even have to kneel on the ground and kowtow to them. In the past, under Kuomintang rule, no one dared to expose the dark secrets of this tool of the imperialist elements for oppressing the Chinese people—"Ren Ci Tang." The workers and children who were tormented here could not get any protection from anyone.

    After liberation, we learned about the changes in the outside world, learned how great and lovable our motherland is, and learned how the People's Government and Chairman Mao cherish the people. Now my family has been allocated land. I have also joined the trade union and was elected as its chairman. I have also become the head of the Catholic Reform Group here. Thinking back to the past, I feel immense hatred. I ask the government to severely punish these evil imperialist elements and hope that the People's Government will quickly take over "Ren Ci Tang."

    “仁慈堂”的帝国主义分子残酷虐待工人
    编辑同志：我叫宋桂芬，河北省徐水县人。我来“仁慈堂”已经九年了。我的工作是在大厨房给儿童作饭。我们的生活苦极了。一日三餐，早饭是一碗稀粥，喝完也看不到一粒米。中午是一碗小米饭和两个半生的馒头。晚饭又是稀粥。菜是臭菜汤。每月薪金四千元，只够买一双坏袜子。衣服不够穿，冬天没有棉衣，也不给生火，向她们要棉衣也不给。肚子吃不饱，有时就偷着到外边买回五百元的杂面条吃。她们要我们打扫屋子，扫帚还要我们自己掏钱买。我曾在洗衣房给帝国主义分子洗过衣服。衣服都是白的。每次要分到四、五十件衣服洗。洗这些衣服只给一条（两小块）肥皂，稍洗不净还要挨骂。她们把我们工友看得连狗都不如。她们的狗每天吃面包、烹肉、白米饭。她们自己吃的当然更好。因为我挣不了钱，养不了家，我把孩子也接到这里。孩子在这里可真受了苦。我和孩子病了也没有人问。每天见了她们还要迎笑请安，她们却神气十足，带理不理。过年的时候，还得爬在地上给她们磕头。从前，在国民党统治的时候，对这个帝国主义分子欺侮咱们中国人民的工具——“仁慈堂”，谁也不敢揭它的黑幕。在这里受折磨的工友、儿童，也得不到任何人的保护。
    解放后，我们知道了外面事物的变化，知道了祖国的伟大可爱，知道了人民政府和毛主席是如何爱护人民。现在我家里分到了土地。我又参加了工会，并被选为正主席。我又当了这里天主教革新组的正组长。回想到过去，我真痛恨万分，我要求政府严办这些万恶的帝国主义分子，并盼望人民政府赶快接办“仁慈堂”。
