    Workers at Baichengzi Station in Northeast China Pledge to Increase Production and Practice Economy by Over 800 Million Yuan by Year's End

    Comrade Editor: After discussion, all the staff and workers of our Baichengzi Station unanimously responded to Chairman Mao's great call to launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy, striving to complete the task of loading 100,000 more freight cars for the entire Northeast Railway this year and handing over profits of 1 trillion yuan. The workers proposed: use our brains, find tricks, calculate carefully, strengthen our study of the economic accounting system, shorten loading and unloading time by 48 percent, and ensure that we load 300 more freight cars in the fourth quarter. In addition, we also organized the study of Li Xikui's shunting method to shorten each shunting time by 4 percent and transfer time by 6 percent, resolutely eliminate all accidents, large and small, and ensure the safe and punctual operation of trains, striving to complete the fourth quarter transportation task ten days ahead of schedule. In terms of practicing strict economy, we have adopted the method of "focusing on the big picture and starting with the small things," striving to avoid wasting a single piece of paper or a bit of public property, and saving 20 percent of materials. We guarantee to increase production and practice economy for the country by 829 million yuan by the end of this year. In addition, the workers are also donating weapons with great enthusiasm. Everyone proposed: donate 30 to 50 percent of the bonus, strive to complete the donation plan one month ahead of schedule, and exceed the target by 5 million yuan, to increase the strength of resistance against America and aid to Korea and support the Chinese People's Volunteers.
