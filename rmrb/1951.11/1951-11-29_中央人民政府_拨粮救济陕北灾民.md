    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 28th -- This year, Yulin and Suide Prefectures in Shaanxi Province suffered crop failure due to drought. Recently, the Central People's Government specially allocated 142,000 shi of millet to relieve the affected farmers and support them in production for self-salvation.
    Northern Shaanxi suffered from drought this year, and more than 70% of the autumn fields in Yulin and Suide Prefectures were almost completely lost. After the disaster occurred, the Northwest Military and Political Committee and the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government instructed the people's governments at all levels in the aforementioned areas to focus all their work on production for disaster relief, and dispatched working groups to Yulin and Suide to guide and assist in production and disaster relief efforts. The Shaanxi Provincial People's Government also distributed 26,000 shi of millet as relief grain. The state-owned economic organizations in the Northwest also purchased local products from farmers and provided loans in the aforementioned areas to help farmers overcome the famine. Currently, the disaster situation in the aforementioned areas has stopped developing, and under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the broad masses of farmers have universally launched a production for self-salvation movement.

    拨粮救济陕北灾民
    【新华社西安二十八日电】陕西省榆林专区和绥德专区今年因旱歉收，最近中央人民政府特拨发小米一十四万二千市石赈济歉收的农民，并扶助农民生产自救。
    陕北今年天旱，榆林、绥德两专区的百分之七十以上的秋田几乎完全失收。灾害发生后，西北军政委员会和陕西省人民政府就指示上述地区的各级人民政府以生产救灾为一切工作的中心任务，派遣工作组前往榆林、绥德一带指导和帮助生产救灾工作。陕西省人民政府并发放了二万六千市石小米的救济粮。西北各国营经济机关也在上述地区收购农民的土产和发放贷款，帮助农民度荒。现在，上述地区的灾情已停止发展，广大农民在共产党和人民政府领导下，普遍展开了生产自救运动。
