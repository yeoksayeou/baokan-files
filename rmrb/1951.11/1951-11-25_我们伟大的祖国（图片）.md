    Our Great Motherland
    Wang Xian, a 71-year-old emancipated farmer in Shangqi Village, Yantai City, Shandong Province, spent 18 years reclaiming ten mu of orchards before liberation, but they were all seized by the landlords. After liberation, the People's Government helped him recover these ten mu of orchards, and the cooperative also gave him great assistance. Wang Xian's enthusiasm for production has been unprecedentedly increased, and he has achieved a bumper harvest of more than 7,000 jin of apples this year. Look how happy he is picking the red and big apples!
