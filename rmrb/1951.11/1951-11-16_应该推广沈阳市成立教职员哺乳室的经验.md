    Experience of Establishing Nurseries for Faculty and Staff in Shenyang Should Be Promoted

    Editor: After liberation, due to the increased political status and political awareness of women, many people are requesting to participate in social work. However, they are all burdened with children. If they participate in work, they cannot take care of their children; if they leave the children at home, they are afraid that something unexpected will happen to the children. They are really in a dilemma. The solution to this problem is to establish nurseries or breastfeeding rooms. Therefore, I hope that all schools and institutions can learn from the experience of the Shenyang Municipal Faculty and Staff Nursery and establish a large number of simply equipped nurseries or breastfeeding rooms to solve the problem of female comrades bringing children.

　　应该推广沈阳市成立教职员哺乳室的经验
    编辑同志：解放以后，由于妇女的政治地位和政治觉悟的提高，有许多人要求参加社会工作。但是，她们都有孩子的牵累，要参加工作，就没法照顾孩子；把孩子留在家里，则又怕孩子发生意外。她们真是左右为难。解决这个问题的办法，只有成立托儿所或哺乳室。因此，我希望各学校、机关，能吸取沈阳市教职员哺乳室的经验，大量创办设备简单的托儿所或哺乳室，以解决妇女同志们带孩子的问题。
