　　Beijing Private Wuxiang Clothing Factory
    Steals Raw Materials for Cotton Clothes and Hats Entrusted by Various Agencies
    To the Editor: The Beijing private Wuxiang Clothing Factory undertook to make 16,500 sets of cotton uniforms for the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region, 8,200 sets of cotton uniforms for the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, and 5,000 cotton overcoats for the People's Government of Rehe Province in November of last year. In order to seek exorbitant profits, the factory stole a large amount of cotton sent by the entrusting units. According to the investigation, the factory stole more than 20 bales of cotton, totaling more than 2,000 catties. In July of last year, the Beijing Clothing General Factory subcontracted the work of 14,000 cotton hats entrusted by the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region to the factory. At that time, the Beijing Clothing General Factory issued 3.5 liang of cotton per hat to the factory, but when the factory subcontracted 4,800 cotton hats to other clothing factories, it only issued 3.3 liang of cotton per hat, which was tens of catties less. In other cases, such as the 30,000 pairs of cotton gloves made by the factory from the Beijing Clothing General Factory, not only was there two qian less cotton in each pair of gloves, but also half of them were replaced with bad cotton. In addition to the above, when the factory made leather gloves and leather hats for the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region in July of last year, it even privately engraved the seal of the inspector and stamped it on the gloves and hats that had been made but had not been inspected. In short, the factory's illegal profit-making behavior is extremely serious. The factory's repeated illegal profit-seeking behavior has been exposed because the political consciousness of the factory's workers has now been raised. I hope that the relevant departments will quickly deal with this matter and impose legal sanctions on the factory.

### 北京市私营戊襄被服厂竟偷窃各机关委托所做的棉衣棉帽原料

　　北京市私营戊襄被服厂
    竟偷窃各机关委托所做的棉衣棉帽原料
    编辑同志：北京市私营戊襄被服厂于去年十一月承做华北后勤军需部的棉制服一万六千五百套、中央人民政府铁道部的棉制服八千二百套，以及热河省人民政府的棉大衣五千件。该厂为了贪图暴利，竟大量偷窃各委托单位送来的棉花。据调查结果，该厂共偷了棉花二十多包，计二千多斤。去年七月，北京被服总厂将华北后勤军需部所委托的一万四千顶棉帽子的活转给该厂做。当时被服总厂发给该厂每顶帽子棉花三两五钱，但该厂把四千八百顶棉帽转包给其他被服厂时，每顶仅发棉花三两三钱，少发了数十斤。其他如该厂由北京被服总厂领做的三万双棉手套，非但每双手套少放二钱棉花，而且有一半都换用了坏棉花。除上述情况外，该厂在去年七月为华北后勤军需部做皮手套与皮帽子时，竟私刻检验员的图章，自行盖在已做好而未曾检验过的手套与帽子上。总之，该厂非法取利的现象是极其严重的。该厂这种一再非法图利的行为，因为现在该厂工人的政治觉悟提高了，所以都被揭发出来了。我希望有关部门迅速处理此事，给该厂以法纪的制裁。
