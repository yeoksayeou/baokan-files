The Central Trade Ministry Directs Department Stores in All Regions
Conscientiously Inspect Prices and Correct Conservative Reluctance to Sell

The Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government has instructed state-run department stores in all regions to conscientiously inspect the sale prices of the various goods they handle, correct the mindset of conservative reluctance to sell, establish bargain departments, vigorously promote the sale of slow-moving, unpopular, and defective goods, and fully meet the needs of the people, so as to stabilize commodity prices at the current levels. The directive initially points out that it is currently the peak trading season, with agricultural products being successively launched on the market in large quantities and procurement work being carried out in various regions, and industrial products have also begun to sell well. Although state-run department stores in various regions have vigorously prepared materials for timely supply, some trade cadres have a conservative reluctance to sell in their operations and are often affected by the market, raising prices groundlessly. Therefore, the directive requires trade administrative departments in various regions to conscientiously inspect whether the commodity sale prices and wholesale and retail price differences of department stores at all levels are reasonable, and strictly correct the tendency of excessively high prices and blindly following market prices.

The directive also instructs state-run trade departments to, as far as possible, control the finished products of public and private production units that are supplied with raw materials by state-run specialized companies through the specialized companies that handle the finished products or through the relationship of supplying raw materials, so as to control the selling prices of their commodities. State-run specialized companies should, under the leadership of the local trade administrative departments, conscientiously conclude and implement triangular contracts. Trade administrative departments and state-run department stores in various producing areas should carefully consider and investigate the production costs and various circumstances of factories that raise factory prices; before thoroughly clarifying the situation, they should not raise factory prices, let alone raise purchase prices.

The directive requires state-run department stores in various regions to vigorously promote the quality, uses, usage, and effects of non-branded goods, and to make the operation of non-branded department stores the focus of future department store operations and the main direction for expanding the source of industrial products.

The directive finally requires state-run department stores in various regions to seize the peak trading season, increase the number of bargain departments, and actively dispose of slow-moving, unpopular, and defective goods. For timely and seasonal commodities, various regions are also required to sell them all during the peak sales season to accelerate capital turnover.

　　中央贸易部指示各地百货公司
    切实检查各货牌价纠正保守惜售思想
    中央人民政府贸易部指示各地国营百货公司切实检查所经营的各种货品的出售牌价，纠正保守惜售的思想，并设廉价部，大力推销冷、背、残货和充分供应人民需要，使百货价格稳定于现在的价格水平。指示首先指出：目前正值贸易旺季，农产品相继大量上市，各地收购工作已相继展开，工业品亦已开始畅销。各地国营百货公司虽已大力准备物资及时供应，但有些贸易干部在经营上存在着保守惜售思想，常受市场影响，无根据地调高牌价，因此指示要求各地贸易行政部门切实检查各级百货公司的商品出售牌价和批发零售差价是否合理，严格纠正牌价偏高和盲目跟随市价提高牌价的偏向。
    指示并责成各地国营贸易部门对于由国营专业公司供给原料的公营和私营的生产单位，应尽可能通过经营该项成品的专业公司掌握其成品，或通过供给原料的关系，掌握其出售商品价格。国营各专业公司间，在当地贸易行政部门领导下，应切实订立和执行三角合同。各产地贸易行政部门及国营百货公司，对工厂调高厂价要慎重考虑，详查其生产成本及各方情况；在未彻底弄清情况前，不应调高厂价，更不应提价收购。
    指示要求各地国营百货公司大力宣传非名牌货的质量、用途、用法及效果，并把经营非名牌百货作为今后百货经营的重点和扩大工业品来源的主要方向。
    指示最后要求各地国营百货公司抓紧贸易旺季，增设廉价部，积极处理冷、背、残货。对于适时的有季节性的商品，也要求各地在畅销季节内全部卖光，以加速资金周转。
