Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 6th:

Mr. Chairman, esteemed Council members, friends:

History tells us that using force for conquest has never been successful. Even if some achieve temporary success, the ending is inevitably met with extremely cruel failure.

I come from Asia, and I will use the facts of recent years in Asia to prove this.

Japanese imperialism was the most powerful war-mongering and aggressive country in Asia a few years ago. Especially in the seven or eight years after launching a large-scale war of aggression against China in 1937, many countries in the Far East were conquered by it, and the territories of many countries were occupied by it. For a time, it became the overlord of Asia. However, it suffered resistance from the people of Asian countries, and in 1945, it was finally forced to surrender.

After Japan's surrender, Chiang Kai-shek, the traitor of China, once received strong support from the American government and had absolutely superior military strength. Therefore, in 1946, he dared to launch a large-scale anti-people civil war, but the result was a complete defeat. Now he has fled to Taiwan Island, relying on the cover of the American army to eke out a meager existence there.

After the American government's support for Chiang Kai-shek's failure, it followed the old trick of Japanese imperialism. In June 1950, while invading and occupying Taiwan, it launched a war of intervention in Korea. The so-called United Nations forces held by the United States are, of course, absolutely superior in terms of weapons. Except for the atomic bomb, any weapon has already been used in Korea. Many cities in Korea have been reduced to rubble, and hundreds of thousands of peaceful residents have been massacred. However, was Korea conquered? No. Not only was it not, but the United Nations forces were driven back from the Yalu River to the vicinity of the "38th parallel," where the war was originally launched.

These facts clearly tell us: no matter how superior your military force is in quality, no matter whether the method of conquest you adopt is direct or indirect, trying to conquer people by force is only a futile dream.

However, people with a strong desire for conquest still refuse to accept the lessons of history and believe in military force.

Now, let's take the Korean War as an example again.

The United States and the governments of some countries that follow the United States have clearly lost their gamble in the Korean War. From October 25, 1950, to October 10 this year, in these eleven and a half months, according to incomplete statistics, a total of more than 387,000 soldiers of the United Nations forces were killed, wounded, or captured, of which more than 176,000 were American soldiers. This is exactly three times the number of American casualties in the first year of the Pacific War, which was 58,000. The loss of weapons, taking only aircraft as an example, is already considerable. A total of 2,310 aircraft were shot down, damaged, or captured.

But despite this, the just actions taken by the Chinese and Korean people are aimed at peacefully resolving the Korean issue. Therefore, when Mr. Malik, the representative of the Soviet Union to the United Nations, proposed on June 23 this year that negotiations between the warring parties for an armistice and the withdrawal of troops from both sides from the 38th parallel should be the first step in achieving a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the Chinese and Korean people were the first to respond to this proposal and expressed their willingness to reach an armistice agreement quickly on a fair and reasonable basis in order to further enable the Korean issue and other issues in the Far East to be resolved peacefully.

Although the American government was forced to accept the armistice negotiations due to the difficulties it suffered in the war and the pressure of world public opinion, more than 110 days have passed since the negotiations began on July 10. However, for the purpose of diplomacy and internal affairs, the United States has spared no effort in creating various provocative incidents to delay the progress of the negotiations. We can see how insincere the American side is towards the negotiations simply by citing a series of actions taken by American aircraft to sabotage the Kaesong Neutral Zone since the beginning of the negotiations. From August 17 to August 30, American aircraft intruded into the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone to conduct patrol reconnaissance and other hostile actions as many as 16 times, using a total of 31 aircraft.

On the night of August 22, an American aircraft intruded into the Kaesong Neutral Zone and carried out a murderous bombing and strafing of the residence of the Chinese and Korean delegation.

At 2:40 a.m. on August 29, an American aircraft intruded into the Kaesong Neutral Zone and dropped flares.

At 0:30 a.m. on September 1, an American aircraft intruded into the Kaesong Neutral Zone and dropped two bombs about 600 meters away from the residence of General Nam Il, the chief representative of the Chinese and Korean delegation. From September 1 to September 8, American aircraft intruded into the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone to conduct patrol reconnaissance and other hostile actions a total of 139 sorties.

At 1:35 a.m. on September 10, an American aircraft intruded into the Kaesong Neutral Zone and strafed the meeting place.

These are the fundamental attitudes that the American government has adopted towards the Korean armistice negotiations, and they are also the fundamental attitudes of the American government towards the Chinese and Korean people.

Since defeating Chiang Kai-shek, the Chinese people have been increasingly hated by the American government. Its desire to conquer Korea is, in fact, a preparation for conquering China. In addition to this, the American government's hostile actions against the Chinese people are countless. It hinders the People's Republic of China from obtaining the legitimate status it should enjoy in the United Nations. It tore up the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation at the United Nations meetings and refused to withdraw its armed forces from Taiwan. It held the United Nations hostage and passed a resolution on February 1 this year that slandered China as the "aggressor" in Korea, and on May 18, it passed a resolution on an embargo against China. The American government was confident that this would deal a heavy blow to China and isolate China. However, it is not China that has been isolated, but the United States itself. The various tricks played by the American government only expose the American government's trampling on the United Nations Charter, turning the United Nations organization, which allows the people of the world to seek peace together, into a tool controlled by the American government to cover up aggression.

The American government should have become smarter in the face of these facts, right? However, it is not. It has failed in the Korean War but is unwilling to fail. It has failed in its policy of blockading China but still wants to strengthen the blockade. It has gone down the wrong road and does not want to turn back, but instead accelerates its pace, thinking that it can finish the wrong road. Look, the American government, using the tense situation created by the Korean War, has passed a military budget as large as an astronomical figure. Look, from September 4 to 8, the American government held a conference in San Francisco, holding a group of vassal states hostage, and concluded a separate "peace treaty" with Japan with the remnants of Japanese imperialism, which is most hated by all the people of Asia (including the Japanese people). At the same time, there is also the signing of the so-called "U.S.-Japan Bilateral Security Treaty" in order to extend the American military occupation of Japan indefinitely, blatantly rearming Japan, and restoring and utilizing Japan's aggressive forces. In addition, there is the so-called "U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty" and the so-called "U.S.-Australia-New Zealand Tripartite Security Treaty." What those treaties mean to us Chinese people and Asian people, I think there is no need to say more here.

Mr. Truman and Mr. Acheson are constantly playing with the word "peace." It is said that they are massacring the Korean people on a large scale for "peace," helping the French army massacre the Vietnamese people for "peace," helping the Philippine government massacre the Philippine people for "peace," and colluding with the remnants of Japanese militarists to rearm Japan is also for "peace." However, unfortunately, all the facts written in blood cannot be concealed by sweet lies. The crimes of the Japanese militarists have left a fresh impression in the hearts of the Asian people. The American government has openly become friends with the Japanese militarists today, very good, very good, we welcome it very much. Because this does not strengthen the power of the United States, but guides the people of Asian countries to be even more resentful of the American government, thereby strengthening the power of the unity of the Asian people. Mr. Truman, Mr. Acheson, you have nakedly exposed your ambitions and also nakedly exposed the unrepentant faces of the Japanese militarists. Who have you helped in the end?

All clumsy tricks can be stopped. It is time to seriously consider the problem. The anger of the people has spread throughout the Far East and the Middle East, and has spread to North Africa. If the American government and the governments of other countries that follow the United States are sincere in pursuing peace, the problem is very simple: do not add fuel to the fire, but draw firewood from under the pot.

Restoring peace is actually a very simple matter. As long as the people of all countries in the world reach out to each other, make friends, and reason with each other, the world will have peace. But to conquer everything by force, or to maintain a balance of power by means of an arms race, we can assert that it is completely wishful thinking based on historical experience. On the contrary, whoever runs faster in the arms race will fail faster.

If you go down the wrong road, you have to turn back, don't keep going forward at a faster pace.

Therefore, we completely agree with Vice-Chairman Nenni's report. We Chinese people do not feel any difficulty in the matter of disarmament. We do not need to invade any country. What we need is peaceful construction. If we can save military spending and use it as production and construction funds, none of our 475 million people in China will oppose it.

In peacetime, our army is, in fact, the people who have not left production. They are harnessing the Huai River, building railways, reclaiming wasteland, and engaged in all national construction undertakings. It is very easy for them to take off their military uniforms and put on civilian clothes.

Moreover, we know very well that if there is to be a war, winning the war is also winning peace. The deciding factor is not the number of troops or the superiority of military weapons, but whether the nature of the war can win the support of the people. If it is an anti-people war of aggression, no matter how many troops you have or how good your weapons are, you will not fail. If it is a just war against aggression, the final victory will inevitably belong to the people. The people are invincible. Even if they are at a military disadvantage, they can overcome the superior enemy. Isn't the Korean War a perfect example of this? Therefore, we do not feel afraid of reducing armaments at all. Because we fundamentally do not want to invade others, but we are also fundamentally not afraid of others invading us.

Let me return to the Korean issue. If the American government does not interfere in Korea, does not invade our Taiwan, and does not keep firing the rockets of war at our doorstep, we Chinese people would not fight the American army. Our purpose in helping the Korean people fight is to strive for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. The armistice negotiations in Kaesong have been going on for more than three months. Although the American side has done its best to delay and obstruct them, the negotiating delegations of the Korean and Chinese sides have always strived to establish an agreement on a fair and reasonable basis with a patient, sincere, and responsible attitude. The question today is whether the American government is also willing to do so. If they are willing, we believe that the goal of peacefully resolving the Korean issue can be achieved.

We only recognize one simple truth: the affairs of all countries in the world must be managed by the people of each country themselves. If this can be done, the crisis of war will be immediately eliminated. All existing disputes in the Pacific region, Asia, and North Africa can be resolved through peaceful negotiations on the basis of this principle. Therefore, a fair and reasonable Korean armistice agreement must first be reached as the first step towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. And the resolution of the Korean issue will create conditions for the resolution of the Far East and other issues in the world.

We Chinese people love peace very much. This is clearly reflected in our four or five thousand years of history, and it is even more clearly reflected in our enthusiastic participation in the signing of peace covenants and the voting on the Japanese issue in these current facts. From April to July this year, a total of 344,053,057 people in our country signed the Declaration of the Peace Covenant, and a total of 339,900,392 people voted against arming Japan and demanding the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan. Last year, the number of people in our country who signed the Stockholm Declaration was 223,739,545, and the numbers for the two items this year exceeded this number by more than 100 million, which can prove that our Chinese people have a constantly growing sincerity in supporting the cause of peace.

We Chinese people are confident that we can maintain intellectual clarity. We have developed a kind of wisdom in the long-term disasters of being oppressed for more than 100 years, which is to be able to sharply distinguish between enemies and friends. For example, atomic bombs, some countries use them as weapons of mass murder and often use them for intimidation and blackmail, while some countries resolutely advocate banning them as weapons of murder and have in fact used them to transform nature and engage in peaceful construction. Which side deserves our admiration and which side deserves our contempt?

We can appreciate Whitman's "Leaves of Grass," but we cannot help but extremely despise Acheson's "White Paper."

We can sincerely welcome friends like Robertson and Fast to China, but they cannot get visas from the American government.

We have many scholars and students who want to return from the United States to serve their motherland, but they are being detained by the American government.

These facts enable us to truly understand American-style "freedom" and American-style "democracy."

We welcome all sincere friends from all over the world. We respect the labor products of the people of all countries, and we respect the cultures of all countries with excellent traditions.

The road to peace is the road of the people, the road of fraternal love, the road of economic mutual assistance and cultural exchange. This road is unobstructed, and anyone who is selfless and truly serves the happiness of mankind can walk it.

The policy of blackmail and the policy of war are only policies of digging one's own grave, and of course, they can never repel the huge waves of peace.

We firmly believe: peace will surely triumph over war!

### 我们坚决地相信：和平一定战胜战争！——我国代表团团长郭沫若在世界和平理事会五日上午会议上的发言

    我们坚决地相信：和平一定战胜战争！
    ——我国代表团团长郭沫若在世界和平理事会五日上午会议上的发言主席、各位理事、各位朋友们：
    历史告诉我们，用武力从事征服从来没有过成功的例子。即使有的获得一时的成功，结局必然遭受到极残酷的失败。
    我是从亚洲来的人，我要把亚洲近年的事实拿来证明。
    日本帝国主义在几年前是亚洲最强大的好战的侵略国家；特别是在一九三七年发动了大规模的侵华战争之后的七八年间，远东的好些国家被它征服了，好些国家的领土被它侵占了，在一个时期之内它成了亚洲的霸王。然而它遭受了亚洲各国人民的反抗，在一九四五年终于被迫投降了。
    日本投降以后，中国的卖国贼蒋介石曾经受到美国政府的大力支持，有着绝对优势的武力，故在一九四六年敢于发动大规模的反人民的内战，但结果是一败涂地，现在已跑到台湾岛上靠着美国军队的掩护，在那儿苟延残喘了。
    美国政府在支持蒋介石失败之后，又蹈袭着日本帝国主义的故技，在一九五零年六月侵占台湾的同时，发动了干涉朝鲜的战争。美国所挟持的所谓联合国军队，在武器方面当然是绝对优越的。除掉原子弹之外，任何武器都已经在朝鲜使用了。朝鲜的好些城市化为了平地，成千成万的和平居民遭受了屠杀。然而朝鲜被征服了吗？没有。不仅没有，而联合国军队反而从鸭绿江边早就被赶回到原来发动战争的“三八”线附近。
    这些事实明显地告诉我们：无论你的武力在质量上多么优越，无论你所采用的征服方式是直接的或间接的，想以武力来征服人都只是徒劳的梦想。
    然而，征服欲旺盛的人，却始终不肯接受历史的教训而迷信着武力。
    现在还是再以朝鲜战争为例吧。
    美国和追随美国的一些国家的政府，在朝鲜战争中的赌博明明地是输了。单从一九五零年十月二十五日到今年十月十日这十一个半月中，据不完全的统计，联合国的军队被击毙被击伤被俘掳的一共有三十八万七千多名，其中美军占十七万六千人以上。这是太平洋战争第一年美军伤亡人数五万八千的整整三倍。武器的损失，单拿飞机一项来说已很可观。飞机被击落被击伤被缴获的一共有二千三百一十架。
    但尽管这样，中朝人民所采取的正义行动，目的就是要和平解决朝鲜问题。因此，当苏联出席联合国的代表马立克先生于今年六月二十三日提出以交战双方谈判停战、双方军队撤离三八线作为实现和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步的建议时，中朝人民首先响应了这个建议，并表示愿意在公平合理的基础上，迅速达成停战协议，以便进一步使朝鲜问题以及远东其他问题得到和平解决。
    美国政府虽然由于在战争中所遭受的困难和全世界舆论的压力而被迫接受了停战谈判，但自七月十日开始谈判以来，已经过去了一百一十多天了，而美国却又为了外交和内政的目的，不惜制造种种的挑衅事件，来拖延谈判的进行。我们单举自谈判开始以来美方飞机所采取的破坏开城中立区的一系列的行动，便可以看出美方对于谈判是怎样毫无诚意。自八月十七日至八月三十日止，美方飞机侵入开城中立区上空进行巡逻侦察等敌对行动达十六次，所用飞机共三十一架。
    八月二十二日夜，美方飞机一架侵入开城中立区，向中朝代表团住所施行谋杀性的轰炸和扫射。
    八月二十九日晨二时四十分，美方飞机一架侵入开城中立区投下照明弹。
    九月一日零时三十分，美方飞机一架侵入开城中立区，向中朝代表团首席代表南日将军住所附近距离约六百公尺处，投下炸弹两枚。从九月一日至九月八日止，美方飞机侵入开城中立区上空进行巡逻侦察等敌对行动共达一百三十九架次。
    九月十日一时三十五分，美方飞机一架侵入开城中立区，向会场地区施行扫射。
    这些就是美国政府对于朝鲜停战谈判所采取的根本态度，也是美国政府对中国人民和朝鲜人民的根本态度。
    中国人民自从打败了蒋介石以后，一直被美国政府加紧仇视着。它的想征服朝鲜，其实也就是作为征服中国的准备。在这之外，美国对中国人民的敌对行动是数不清的。它阻挠中华人民共和国取得在联合国中应该享有的合法地位。它在联合国会议上撕毁开罗宣言和波茨坦公告，拒绝把它的武装力量撤出台湾。它挟持着联合国，在今年二月一日通过了诬蔑中国为在朝鲜的“侵略者”的决议案，在五月十八日又通过了对中国禁运的决议案。美国政府满以为这样就会给中国以沉重的打击，会把中国孤立起来。然而被孤立了的不是中国，而是美国自己。美国政府所玩弄的种种手法，只是暴露了美国政府蹂躏联合国宪章，使世界人民共谋和平的联合国机构化成为美国政府所操纵的掩饰侵略的御用工具而已。
    美国政府在这些事实面前，应该变得更聪明一些了吧？然而却是不然，它在朝鲜战争中失败了但不甘于失败。它在封锁中国的政策中失败了却还想加强封锁。它走错了路不想回头，反而加快速度地走，以为可以把错路走完。请看吧，美国政府利用朝鲜战争所造成的紧张局势，已经通过了天文数字一样庞大的军事预算。请看吧，九月四日至八日，美国政府又挟持着一群仆从国家，举行了旧金山会议，与全亚洲人民（包括日本人民在内）所最痛恨的日本帝国主义的残余分子，缔结了单独的对日“和约”。与这同时，更有所谓“美日双边安全条约”的签订，以便无期限地延长美军对日本的占领，明目张胆地来重新武装日本，恢复并利用日本的侵略势力。此外，还有所谓“美菲联防条约”，所谓
    “美澳纽三边安全条约”。那些条约对于我们中国人民和亚洲人民究竟是意味着什么，我想用不着在这儿多说了。
    杜鲁门艾奇逊先生们都经常在玩弄着“和平”的字样。据说他们大量屠杀朝鲜人民是为了“和平”，帮助法国军队屠杀越南人民是为了“和平”，帮助菲律宾政府屠杀菲律宾人民是为了“和平”，与日本的军国主义者的残余相勾结，重新武装日本也是为了“和平”。然而可惜得很，一切血写出来的事实，不是甜蜜的诳言所能掩盖得了的。日本军国主义者的罪行，在亚洲人民心中所留下来的印象还新鲜得很。美国政府今天和日本军国主义者公开地做起朋友来了，很好，很好，我们欢迎之至。因为这不是加强了美国的力量，而是导引了亚洲国家人民对美国政府更加愤恨，从而加强了亚洲人民团结的力量。杜鲁门先生，艾奇逊先生，你们把自己的野心赤裸裸地暴露了出来，把日本军国主义者不知悔祸的面目也赤裸裸地暴露了出来，你们到底帮助了谁呢？
    一切不高明的戏法可以收手了，是应该严肃地考虑问题的时候了。人民的怒火已经燃遍了远东和中东，并且蔓延到了非洲北部。假如美国政府和其他追随美国的国家政府有诚意追求和平的话，问题很简单，便是不要在火上加油，而是要从釜底抽薪。
    恢复和平认真说是很简单的事。只要世界各国的人民伸出手来互相把握，做朋友讲道理，世界也就有和平了。但要用武力来征服一切，或用武力竞赛来保持均势，我们根据历史的经验，可以断言那完全是妄想。恰恰相反，谁要在武力竞赛上跑得愈快，谁就失败得愈快。
    走错了道路只好走回头，不要再加快地往前走。
    因此，我们听了南尼副主席的报告完全表示同意。我们中国人民在裁军问题上丝毫不感觉困难，我们不需要侵略任何国家，我们所需要的是和平建设，如果能够把军费节省下来作为生产建设费，我们全中国四亿七千五百万人谁也不会反对的。
    我们的军队在平时事实上是没有脱离生产的人民，他们在治淮河、修铁路、垦辟荒地，从事一切国家建设事业。要他们脱下军装换上平民服装，那是再容易也没有的事。
    而且，我们知道得很清楚，假使要有战争的话，赢得战争也就是赢得和平。决定的因素并不在军队数目的多寡与军火的优劣，而是在战争的性质能不能得到人民的拥护。假使是反人民的侵略战争，尽管你军队多武器好，但没有不失败的。假如是反侵略的正义战争，最后的胜利必然属于人民。人民是不可战胜的，它在军事上纵属劣势，也能够克服优势的敌人。朝鲜战争不就是当前绝好的一个证明吗？因此，我们对于裁减军备丝毫也不感觉恐慌。因为我们根本不想侵略别人，但也根本不怕别人侵略。
    还是让我回到朝鲜问题来吧。如果美国政府不干涉朝鲜，不侵占我们的台湾，不把战争的火箭一直投进我们的大门，我们中国人民是不会和美国军队打仗的。我们帮助朝鲜人民打仗的目的，也就是为了争取朝鲜问题的和平解决。开城的停战谈判已经三个多月了，尽管美方尽力拖延阻挠，但朝中两国的谈判代表团，始终是以耐心诚恳负责的态度，来争取在公平合理的基础上成立协议。今天的问题，就只看美国政府也愿不愿意这样做。假使愿意，我们认为和平解决朝鲜问题的目的是可以达到的。
    我们只认识一个简单的真理：世界各国的事务，必须由各国人民自己来管。能够做到这样，战争的危机就会立即消除。所有现存的太平洋区域、亚洲和北非的争端，都可以在这个原则的基础上，以和平谈判的方式来解决。因此，一个公平合理的朝鲜停战协议必须首先达成，以此作为和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步。而朝鲜问题的解决，将为远东和世界其他问题的解决创造条件。
    我们中国人民是酷爱和平的，这清楚地表现在我们四五千年的历史里面，更清楚地表现在我们热烈地参加了和平公约签名和对日问题投票这些当前的事实里面。今年四月到七月，我国人民在和平公约宣言上签名的共有三亿四千四百零五万三千零五十七人，投票反对武装日本要求缔结全面对日和约的人数共有三亿三千九百九十万零三千零九十二人。去年我国人民在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的人数是二亿二千三百七十三万九千五百四十五人，今年的两项数目都超过了这个数目一亿以上，这就可以证明我们中国人民对于和平事业的拥护，是有着不断增长的诚意的。
    我们中国人民自信是能够保持理智的清醒的。我们在经受了一百多年来的长期被压迫的灾难中，养成了一种智慧，就是能够锐敏地分清敌友。例如原子弹，有的国家作为大量杀人的武器，而经常用来进行恐吓讹诈，有的国家则坚决主张禁止作为杀人武器，而已在事实上用以改造自然，从事和平建设，到底那一边值得我们钦佩，那一边值得我们鄙视呢？
    我们能够欣赏惠特曼的“草叶集”，但不能不极端鄙视艾奇逊的“白皮书”。
    我们能够诚心诚意欢迎罗伯逊、法斯特这些朋友到中国，而他们得不到美国政府的签证。
    我们有不少的学者和学生要从美国回来为祖国服务，但他们却被美国政府扣留了。
    这些事实，使我们能够真正地了解美国式的“自由”和美国式的“民主”。
    我们欢迎全世界一切真诚的朋友，我们尊重各国人民的劳动成品，我们尊重各国人民有优良传统的文化。
    和平的道路是人民的道路，是兄弟友爱的道路，是经济互助、文化交流的道路。这条道路是畅通着的，一切大公无私真正为人类幸福服务的人都可以走。
    讹诈政策、战争政策只是自掘坟墓的政策，当然它也决不能把和平的巨浪喝退。
    我们坚决地相信：和平一定战胜战争！
