How Xingtai County's In-Service Cadre Spare-Time Cultural School Was Run Well
　　Li Zhigan
　　The Xingtai County In-Service Cadre Spare-Time Cultural School was formally established in early 1950. It currently has two primary lower classes, five primary higher classes, and five junior high classes, with six full-time teachers and nine part-time teachers. Over the past year, two primary lower classes have advanced to primary higher, and two classes will graduate from primary higher next summer, advancing to junior high. At that time, illiteracy among county-level cadres will be basically eliminated. It is expected that primary higher classes can be cancelled by the winter vacation of the year after next, with all students transferring to junior high. One class in the middle school will be able to graduate by the end of next year, and all current students will be able to graduate from junior high in 1956.
　　After the establishment of the cadre spare-time cultural school, all cadres at the county level in Xingtai County and the urban area below the junior high level have enrolled. Students generally strictly abide by the learning system, and absenteeism has been virtually eliminated. According to statistics, the regular attendance rate from October of last year to the present is 80 percent. From March of last year to the present, except for two and a half months of suspension due to rectification and one and a half months of suspension for studying the "July 1st" document, political classes have been regularly held once a week, and cultural classes five times a week, each lasting one hundred minutes. To take care of the students' health, a ten-minute break exercise is held each time. After a year of study, those who were originally illiterate have learned more than 500 characters, and those who did well have learned 700 to 800 characters and can write short essays. In arithmetic, they have learned addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. In the past, they could not write summaries, fill out forms, or calculate percentages, but now they can write concise summary reports, fill out forms, and calculate percentages. As a result, work efficiency has been greatly improved. Many comrades, in summarizing their learning achievements, mentioned that their work ability has improved significantly, which has greatly increased everyone's work confidence and made learning more active. Now the school has become a school loved by everyone. What is the main reason why the school can be run well?
　　The Care and Leading Role of Leading Cadres
　　At the beginning of the school's establishment, the party organizations and administrative leaders realized that improving the cultural level of cadres also meant improving their work ability, which is an important political task of cultivating construction backbones for the country at present. Therefore, they used great effort to do this work. First, they formulated a relatively long-term study plan, hired more excellent full-time teachers, and solved the necessary funding problems, as well as teaching reference books, teaching aids, and even the school site, classrooms, desks, and chairs. Secondly, leading cadres were very concerned about the spare-time school. For example, Wang Weiqi, secretary of the Xingtai Town Party Committee, regularly understood the working conditions of teachers and the learning situation of students, and provided timely guidance. This greatly stimulated the work and learning enthusiasm of teachers and students. Many comrades said: "In the old society, the children of workers and peasants wanted to go to school but could not enter the school gate. Now the state spends money to run schools for us, how can we not study hard?" Some teachers said: "When I came to the spare-time school, I still had the idea of underestimating this work, but I saw the all-round care of the leading comrades, and this idea was dispelled." Third, leading cadres also set an example by participating in learning. For example, Wang Mingyuan, former deputy secretary of the Town Party Committee, chose to study algebra, He Wanren, deputy county head and town head, participated in the middle school class, Ma Linzhang, chairman of the trade union, entered the primary higher class, and Cui Zishe, manager of the fur company, who was nearly fifty years old, attended classes and handed in homework on time, and urged other cadres to study. County head Hu Xide and deputy county head He Wanren not only persisted in learning, but also achieved the best results, and were called learning models. Under their influence, the wrong idea among cadres that "learning culture reduces political status and is unsightly" was quickly cleared up. Everyone believed that learning was glorious and competed to "learn from the models."
　　Enlightening Students' Consciousness from the Ideological Level
　　Cadre cultural learning is a long-term and arduous struggle. To do this learning well, it is necessary to rely on the cadres' consciousness. Generally speaking, cadres have an urgent need for cultural learning; however, there are still ideological obstacles in specific issues, so attention must be paid to enlightenment and guidance. At the beginning of the school's establishment, there were many wrong ideas among cadres, thinking that: "Learning culture reduces political status." "If you want to learn, you have to leave your job. How can a school be run in the office, isn't it just a fad!" Some had no confidence in learning, saying: "I'm old, my memory is bad, I can't learn it!" Some had complacency, saying: "I have also gone to school for a few years, and I have worked for so many years, isn't that enough for junior high school!" Some even said: "You can still work without culture." After going to school, there was also a general idea of being eager for quick success and lacking patience. Leading comrades analyzed and studied these problems and explained them to everyone. The party branches of various organs also listed the inspection of learning as one of the contents of organizational life, inspecting at least twice a month, praising the good and criticizing the bad. When classing, they fought against the idea of "rather high than low." When they found that students had a phenomenon of underestimating teachers, the leading comrades patiently persuaded the cadres to be elementary school students, learn the teachers' strengths, and not only see their shortcomings. When it was found that cadres were passively because the teachers' teaching was not effective, they explained to the cadres: "The spare-time cultural education work is only just beginning, and the teachers have no experience. Everyone should patiently and actively put forward suggestions for improvement." At the end of May this year, when the semester ended, a top-down general inspection of cadre cultural learning was conducted, inspecting the leadership of the organ party branches and administration on cultural learning, and inspecting the cadres' learning motives, attitudes, and learning achievements. Through this inspection, everyone had a further understanding of cultural learning in thought. Especially after last year's rectification and study, the general comrades realized that learning is for the needs of national construction and for the needs of social development. Because cadres have a correct understanding of the purpose of learning, the learning mood is more vigorous, and the "acute illness" has also been overcome. On the other hand, because they saw their learning achievements in the inspection, their confidence was also improved. After the inspection, the relationship between teachers and students became closer, they put forward opinions to each other and improved teaching methods; the branch and administrative aspects also paid more attention to learning and were more concerned.
　　Sound Organization and Leadership
　　To run a cadre spare-time school well, there must be a sound organization and leadership. The spare-time cultural learning and political learning of cadres in Xingtai County are uniformly led by the Learning Committee. The principles and plans of cultural learning are all decided by the Learning Committee. In order to strengthen the leadership of the spare-time school, a school affairs management committee was established under the Learning Committee. The division of labor of the members is: the head of the County Culture and Education Section is responsible for the regular leadership of the spare-time school, designating a special person to conduct research with teachers and staff on a regular basis, and put forward suggestions for improvement; first solicit the consent of the county head, county party secretary, and propaganda minister, then convene the school affairs management committee to discuss and decide, and then implement them separately. The County Party Committee Propaganda Department pays attention to checking the implementation of the policy and plan, ensuring the implementation and execution of the policy and plan. There are class and group organizations among the students, which play a role in helping and supervising each other. In addition, attention is also paid to the cooperation of the organ administration and the party branch, and the close connection between the organ administration and the school headquarters, guaranteeing the regularity of learning from the organizational level.

    邢台县在职干部业余文化学校是怎样办好的
  　李之乾
    邢台县在职干部业余文化学校，是在一九五○年初正式建立起来的。现有初小两班、高小五班、初中五班，专任教员六人，兼任教员九人。一年多来，已有两个初级班升入高小，明年暑假就可有两班从高小毕业，升入初中班。那时县级机关干部中的文盲就可基本上消灭，预计后年寒假即可取消高小，使全部学员转入初中。中学班明年年底可有一个班毕业，一九五六年现有学员将可全部初中毕业。
    在干部业余文化学校成立以后，邢台县县级机关和城关区初中程度以下的干部，已全部入学。学员一般都能严格遵守学习制度，旷课现象几已消灭。据统计，去年十月到现在经常到课的达百分之八十。去年三月到现在，中间除因整风停课两月半和学习“七一”文件停课一月半外，经常坚持每周上政治课一次，文化课五次，每次都上满一百分钟。为照顾学员的健康起见，每次上十分钟的课间操。经过一年来的学习，原来是文盲的，已认识到五百多字，成绩好的认识到七、八百字，并能写短文，算术学会了加减乘除法；过去不会写总结、不会填报、不会计算百分比的，现在可以写简扼的总结报告了，能填表了，百分比也会计算了，工作效率因此大大提高。不少同志在总结自己的学习成绩时，都提到自己的工作能力有了显著的进步，因而大家的工作信心倍增，学习更加积极。现在该校已成为一所为大家所爱好的学校。该校所以能够办好，最主要原因是什么呢？
    领导干部的关心和带头作用
    开始建校时，党的组织和行政领导同志就认识到提高干部的文化水平，也就是提高干部的工作能力，这在当前是一个为国家培养建设骨干的重要政治任务，因此，用了很大的力量来作这件工作。首先拟定了比较长期的学习计划，又聘请了比较优秀的专任教员，并解决了必要的经费问题，以及教学参考用书、教具，以至校址、教室、桌凳等问题。其次领导干部对业余学校十分关心，例如中共邢台镇委书记王维奇，经常了解教师的工作状况，学员的学习情况，及时给予指导。这样就大大地激发了教员和学员的工作和学习情绪，很多同志说：“在旧社会，工人农民的子女想上学，进不了学校门口。现在国家花钱给咱们办了学，还能不好好学习。”有的教员说：“来业余学校时，还有轻视这件工作的思想，看到了领导同志的多方面关心，这种思想就打消了。”第三，领导干部也都以身作则，参加学习。如前镇委副书记汪明远选修代数，副县长兼镇长禾万仞参加中学班，工会主席麻林章入高小班，年近五十岁的皮毛公司经理崔子畲按时上课，交作业，并督促其他干部学习。县长胡希德、副县长禾万仞不仅能够坚持学习，而且学习成绩最好，被称为学习模范。在他们的影响下，干部中间“学文化是降低政治地位，面子不好看”的错误思想，很快就清除了。大家都认为学习是光荣的，争着要“向模范看齐”。
    从思想上启发学员自觉
    干部文化学习是一件长期的艰苦斗争，要搞好这个学习，必须依靠干部的自觉。一般地说，干部对文化学习的要求是迫切的；但在具体问题上，仍有思想障碍，因此须注意启发诱导。该校开办之初，干部中间存在着好些错误思想，认为：“学文化降低了政治地位。”“要学习就得离开工作岗位，机关里那里能办成个学校，还不是一阵热！”有的对学习没有信心，说：“年岁大，记性坏了，学也学不成了！”有的则有自满情绪，说：“我也上过几年学，又工作了这么多年，难道还不够初中程度吗！”有的甚至说：“没文化照样可以工作。”上学后，又普遍地产生了急于求成的思想，缺乏耐性。领导同志就对这些问题，加以分析研究，向大家进行解释。各机关党支部并把检查学习列为组织生活内容之一，每月至少检查两次，好的加以表扬，坏的给以批评。在编班时向“宁高勿低”的思想作了斗争。当发现学员有轻视教师的现象时，领导同志就耐心地说服干部，要当小学生，学习教员的长处，不要只看到他们的缺点。当发现干部因教师教学不得法，而表现消极时，即向干部说明：“业余文化教育工作还只是开始，教员没有经验，大家要耐心地、积极地提出改进意见。”今年五月底学期终了时，又进行了一次自上而下的干部文化学习大检查，检查机关党支部和行政对文化学习的领导，检查干部的学习动机、态度、学习成绩等。通过这次检查，大家在思想上对文化学习又有了进一步的认识。特别是经过了去年整风学习后，一般同志都认识到学习是为着国家建设的需要，为着社会发展的需要。由于干部对学习目的有了正确的认识，学习情绪更加旺盛了，“急性病”也克服了。另一方面由于他们在检查中看到了自己的学习成绩，信心也提高了。经过检查以后，师生关系更加密切，他们互相提了意见，改进了教学方法；支部与行政方面对学习也更加重视，更加关心了。
    健全组织领导
    要办好干部业余学校，一定要有健全的组织领导。邢台县干部的业余文化学习与政治学习均统一由学习委员会领导。文化学习的方针、计划等原则问题，均由学委会决定。为加强对业余学校的领导，在学委会之下又成立了一个校务管理委员会。委员的分工是：县文教科长负责业余学校的经常领导工作，指定专人经常和教职员进行研究，提出改进意见；先征求县长、县委书记、宣传部长同意，然后再召集校务管理委员会讨论决定，而后分头执行。县委宣传部注意检查方针和计划的贯彻情形，保证了方针、计划的贯彻和执行。在学员中有班和小组的组织，它们起着互相帮助，互相督促的作用。此外，还注意了机关行政和党支部的配合，机关行政和校部的密切连系，从组织上保证了学习的经常性。
