Xinhua News Agency, November 28th: The foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France, along with Adenauer, the puppet Prime Minister of West Germany, held a meeting in Paris on November 22nd to discuss the issue of dragging West Germany into the North Atlantic aggressive bloc to accelerate the rearmament of West Germany. A communique issued after the meeting revealed that the meeting discussed the "progress" of the plan to conclude a "peace agreement" with West Germany. The communique clearly declared that the purpose of concluding this agreement is to "incorporate West Germany into the European group on an equal basis, while the European group itself is included in the developing Atlantic group." After the agreement is concluded, the current occupation regulations will be abolished, but the United States, Britain, and France will still retain "privileges" in West Germany, including the right to continue stationing troops. The communique also stipulated that this agreement should "take effect simultaneously with the agreement to establish the European Defense Community." The core content of the so-called "establishment of the European Defense Community" is to organize a European army with the participation of West German troops as a component of the North Atlantic aggressor army. In this way, the meeting communique once again exposed that the so-called "peace agreement" is actually a war agreement for large-scale arming of West Germany. It uses the abolition of the occupation regulations as a guise, while continuing to maintain the occupation status of West Germany, deepening the division between East and West Germany, and further imposing the shackles of rearmament on the West German people.

This American plan was determined as early as mid-September at the Washington meeting of the U.S., British, and French foreign ministers. The reason why the United States summoned Adenauer to Paris for a meeting this time is that it has encountered great difficulties in promoting this plan. The United States originally intended to complete the negotiation of the "peace agreement" as soon as possible after the Washington meeting, so that the North Atlantic Treaty Council could adopt a resolution at its meeting in November to enable West Germany to participate in the North Atlantic bloc's war preparations. However, the negotiations between the U.S., British, and French High Commissioners in Germany and Adenauer on the conclusion of the "peace agreement," which began in Bonn on September 24, have repeatedly reached a deadlock due to the opposition of the broad masses of the German people, and no final agreement has been reached. Therefore, the United States had to convene this meeting before the North Atlantic Treaty Council meeting held in Rome on November 24th to "remove obstacles."

According to the communique issued after the meeting, the foreign ministers of the U.S., Britain, and France, and Adenauer, passed the draft agreement drawn up by the three countries' High Commissioners in Germany and Adenauer in Bonn. It is said that some problems that could not be solved in the Bonn negotiations were also resolved. However, the United States still failed to reach a comprehensive agreement at the meeting. Supplementary agreements related to this agreement remain to be "completed." And these so-called supplementary agreements actually involve the most important steps in arming West Germany. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Paris on November 23rd, "one of them concerns Germany's (referring to West Germany) contribution to the proposed army under the command of General Eisenhower." Therefore, the Associated Press said: "Nine months of negotiations with the Germans on their contribution to the army have not reached an agreement."

The fact that the foreign ministers of the U.S., Britain, and France openly held a meeting with Adenauer, the remnant of German Nazism, in Paris has aroused the angry opposition of the people of Western Europe. On November 21st, the French people, regardless of the police's brutal interference, held demonstrations and parades on the main streets of Paris to protest Adenauer's arrival in Paris. The demonstrators sang the Marseillaise and shouted "Adenauer get out!" "Ban the rearmament of West Germany!"

The Soviet "Izvestia" published an article by Polyanov on November 24th commenting on the meeting between the foreign ministers of the U.S., Britain, and France, and Adenauer, pointing out that the main task of American diplomats and generals is to incorporate the West German Hitler troops into Eisenhower's army as soon as possible. The conspiracy of the imperialist aggressors seriously violates the international obligations undertaken by the Western powers during the war and after the collapse of Hitler's Germany. This conspiracy once again shows that the imperialist camp continues to intensify preparations for another war. In response to this conspiracy, peace-loving people are becoming more vigilant and are increasingly determined to support the German people's struggle for a unified, independent, peace-loving, and democratic Germany.

    美英法外长和阿登纳在巴黎集会
    阴谋加速武装西德
    法国人民示威高呼：阿登纳滚出去
    【新华社二十八日讯】美英法三国外长和西德傀儡政府总理阿登纳十一月二十二日在巴黎举行会议，讨论把西德拖入北大西洋侵略集团以加速重新武装西德的问题。会后发表的公报透露，会议讨论了和西德缔结“和平协定”计划的“进展”情况。公报明白宣称：缔结这项协定的目的是要把西德“在平等基础上并入欧洲集团之中，而欧洲集团本身又包括在正在发展着的大西洋集团之内”。协定缔结后，目前占领法规将废除，但美英法三国仍将在西德保有“特权”，其中包括继续驻军的权利。公报并规定，这项协定要和“建立欧洲防御集团的协定同时生效”，而所谓“建立欧洲防御集团”的中心内容，就是组织有西德军队参加的欧洲军，作为北大西洋侵略军的组成部分。这样，会议公报又一次暴露了：所谓“和平协定”实际上是大规模武装西德的战争协定，它以废除占领法规为幌子，而继续维持对西德的占领状态，加深德国东西部的分裂，进一步把重新武装的枷锁强加在西德人民身上。
    美国这项计划早在九月中旬美英法三国外长华盛顿会议中就已确定。美国这次所以又召唤阿登纳来巴黎举行会议，是因为在推行这项计划中已遇到很大困难。美国原来打算在华盛顿会议后尽速完成“和平协定”的谈判，以便北大西洋公约理事会在十一月间再度开会时能通过使西德参加北大西洋集团备战活动的决议。但是，美英法三国驻德高级专员与阿登纳间关于缔结“和平协定”的谈判，自从九月二十四日在波恩开始以来，由于遭到德国广大人民的反对，一再陷入僵局，一直没有获得最后协议。于是美国不得不在十一月二十四日起在罗马举行北大西洋公约理事会会议以前，召开这次会议来“排除障碍”。
    据会后公报透露，美英法三国外长和阿登纳在会中通过了三国驻德高级专员与阿登纳在波恩谈判中拟就的协议草案，据说还解决了波恩谈判中所没有能解决的某些问题。但是，美国仍然不能在会议中取得全面协议。和这项协定有关的补充协定尚待“完成”。而这些所谓补充协定实际上牵涉到最主要的武装西德的步骤问题。据美联社巴黎二十三日电透露：其中“有一个关系到德国（指西德）对拟议中的在艾森豪威尔司令部指挥下的军队的贡献”问题。因此，美联社说：“九个月来和德国人进行的关于他们贡献军队的谈判没有获得协议。”
    美英法三国外长这次公然在巴黎和德国纳粹余孽阿登纳举行会议，遭到西欧人民的愤怒反对。十一月二十一日，法国人民不顾警察的蛮横干涉，在巴黎各大马路上举行抗议阿登纳来到巴黎的示威游行，示威者高唱马赛曲，并高喊“阿登纳滚出去！”“禁止重新武装西德！”
    苏联“消息报”十一月二十四日刊载波利扬诺夫评论美英法三国外长和阿登纳这次会议的文章指出：美国外交家和将领们的主要任务，是要把西德希特勒军队尽速编入艾森豪威尔的军队中去。帝国主义侵略者的阴谋严重地违反了西方三国在战时和希特勒德国崩溃后所承担的国际义务。这个阴谋再一次表明帝国主义阵营继续加紧准备另一次战争。为了答复这个阴谋，爱好和平的人民正在提高警惕，同时并日益坚决地表示支持德国人民争取统一、独立、爱好和平和民主的德国的斗争。
