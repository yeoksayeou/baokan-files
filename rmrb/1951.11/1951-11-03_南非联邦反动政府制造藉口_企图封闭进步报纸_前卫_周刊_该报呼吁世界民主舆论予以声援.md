    South African Federal Reactionary Government Fabricates Excuses to Attempt to Close Progressive Newspaper "Advance" Weekly.
    The Newspaper Calls on World Democratic Public Opinion for Support.
    [Our Newspaper News] The reactionary Malan government of the South African Federation is recently fabricating excuses in an attempt to close the progressive newspaper "Advance" Weekly, published in Cape Town, South Africa, in order to stifle the voice of the South African people demanding peace, democracy, and opposing national oppression. Naomi Eplow, the executive editor of "Advance" newspaper, sent a letter to democratic newspapers in various countries around the world on October 17, calling on them to protest the South African government's reactionary measures and support the newspaper's just struggle.
    The appeal from "Advance" Weekly first stated: The Malan Nationalist Party government, which implements dictatorial politics to destroy freedom of the press, is threatening to close the democratic newspaper "Advance" Weekly in South Africa. Since its founding fourteen and a half years ago, "Advance" Weekly has been the most resolute opponent of the Nationalist Party, racial discrimination, and all national oppression legislation in the South African Federation. In particular, since the Nationalist Party came to power in May 1948, "Advance" Weekly has resolutely and courageously opposed their heinous policies of racial discrimination and national segregation.
    The appeal from "Advance" Weekly finally called on all those who uphold freedom of the press and human rights, and those who oppose fascist racial superiority, to protest to the Malan government.

    该报呼吁世界民主舆论予以声援
    【本报讯】南非联邦的马兰反动政府，最近正在制造藉口，企图封闭南非好望角市出版的进步报纸“前卫”周刊，以便窒息南非人民要求和平民主与反对民族压迫的声音。“前卫”报的执行编辑瑙米·爱比罗为此于十月十七日致函世界各国的民主报刊，呼吁各报抗议南非政府的反动措施，支持该报的正义斗争。
    “前卫”周刊的呼吁书首先说：实行独裁政治以摧残新闻自由的马兰国民党政府，威胁着要封闭南非民主的报纸“前卫”周刊。“前卫”周刊自它创办十四年半以来，一直就是南非联邦国民党、种族歧视与一切民族压迫立法的最坚决的反对者，特别是从一九四八年五月国民党执政以来，“前卫”周刊就坚决勇敢地反对它们的种族歧视和民族分居的罪恶政策。
    “前卫”周刊的呼吁书最后要求一切拥护新闻自由与人权的人们，反对法西斯种族优秀论的人们，向马兰政府提出抗议。
