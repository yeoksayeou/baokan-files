    Cuihua Remarries
    Fang Zengxian
    (1) Cuihua is a very capable working woman in Wangjiaying Village, good at needlework and farm work. Unfortunately, her husband died last year. She wanted to remarry, but didn't dare to say it. From then on, she was listless all day long, and her production was not as vigorous as before.
      (2) A'da, the son of Old Wang in the east of the village, used to be a long-term laborer. After the land reform, he was allocated land. Cuihua's house and his house were neighbors, and they often met while working. During the busy farming season, Cuihua couldn't finish the work in her field, and A'da often helped her.
    (3) Over time, they developed feelings for each other from acquaintance. But Old Wang couldn't stand it. He thought it was disgraceful for his son to be involved with a widow. He thought: Now that A'da has land, he should marry a maiden!

    翠花改嫁
    方增先
    （一）翠花是王家营村很能干的劳动妇女，不管针线活、庄稼活样样都行。不幸在去年死了丈夫。她想要嫁人，又不敢说出口。从此整天价无精打采的，生产也不如过去起劲了。
      （二）村东王老头的儿子阿大，往年给人当长工，土地改革后分得了土地。翠花家和他家是地邻，做活常常碰见。在农忙时，翠花的地里的活干不过来，阿大时常帮助她。
    （三）时间长了，他们由熟识而产生了感情。但偏是王老头看不过。他以为儿子跟人家寡妇搞在一道，真不体面。他想：有了土地，阿大该娶个闺女呀！
