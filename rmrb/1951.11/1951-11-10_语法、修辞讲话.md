Grammar and Rhetoric Talks
Lü Shuxiang, Zhu Dexi
Lecture Six: Punctuation

    The "Usage of Punctuation Marks" formulated by the Central People's Government Publishing Administration has been published in the People's Daily on September 26th of this year. It already includes examples illustrating the usage of various punctuation marks. In this lecture, we will not dwell on the basic rules of using these symbols but will instead discuss some situations where problems easily arise.

    Regarding punctuation marks, there is a very popular but erroneous view, specifically expressed in the phrase "add punctuation." In fact, some people even write a paragraph or an entire article and then add some symbols afterward. Doing this means failing to fully utilize punctuation marks.

    We must first have the understanding that punctuation marks are an organic part of the text, not something added externally. They are different from the old-style sentence division marks, which merely pointed out places where the reader might have trouble pausing. Each punctuation mark has a unique function; it would not be an exaggeration to say they are another form of function word. We should treat them like "and," "of," "ne," "ma"—considering whether to use them, and where to use them. When creating an outline, we should think of punctuation at the same time as words and phrases; when writing, we should write both words and punctuation on the paper. It is especially important to have a concept of the sentence. One should determine the end of the sentence before writing the first word, and use a period to mark the end after finishing writing.

    It can even be said that since the advent of punctuation marks, the style of writing has been affected. Most notably, with the question mark, "ma" and "ne" can be used much less; with quotation marks, "so-and-so said" can be used much less; with the ellipsis, the "half-finished sentences" that previously had to be annotated or even admired as strokes of genius (such as Daiyu's "Baoyu! Baoyu! You are..." in chapter 98 of Dream of the Red Chamber) are no longer surprising. From these examples, one can realize that the function of punctuation marks is not just "sentence division," and therefore, they should be fully utilized.

    Punctuation marks are extremely easy to misplace, and proofreaders are also very likely to overlook them. The following examples of inappropriate punctuation in books and periodicals may not match the author's original manuscript. For example, on February 4th of this year, the Guangming Daily had the following passage:

    Comrade Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee of the CPC, instructed: Municipal construction in the capital should have a mass perspective and a mass line. The Dongcheng and Xicheng areas have always been the focus of attention for municipal construction, and the places where the masses live and frequent, were never taken into consideration by the reactionary government. Therefore, our people's municipal construction plan must first consider the producers and working people, clearly distinguishing it from the urban construction policy of the reactionary regime. Let us first eliminate the dirty and smelly ditch—Longxugou—that the ruling class in Beijing has never gone to and never cared about. This sentence is obviously too long and should be divided into several sentences. On the same day, the People's Daily had the same passage, but after "line," after "consideration," and after "policy," it used a period instead of a comma. If we use the Guangming Daily's version as an example, we would be wronging the author. But where can we find proofreading materials for every sentence? We can only speak based on the appearance in books and periodicals. Some writers often make punctuation marks lightly and indistinctly, which also increases the chance of errors. Because punctuation marks are small, they should be written clearly; they should be as clear as the text, or even clearer.

First Section: Periods and Commas

    The form of the period. The form of the period is a small circle. The period in Western punctuation is a small dot, and many people follow suit in Chinese. Although the typesetting shop will change it to a circle, the chance of misplacement increases because the dot is easily confused with the enumeration comma and the comma. Therefore, it is best to use a circle instead of a dot in the original manuscript.

    When a Western word or number is at the end of a sentence, some people advocate using a dot instead of a circle, fearing that the circle will be mistaken for the letter "O" or the number "zero." If the punctuation marks are all skewed to the right, this misunderstanding can be avoided.

    The difference between periods and commas. The period indicates a pause after the end of a sentence, and the comma indicates a pause in the middle of a sentence. (There are several other symbols for indicating pauses in the middle of a sentence, but they have more specialized functions, and only the comma is general.) This distinction seems obvious, but it is not as simple in practice as one might imagine. If you say a sentence is complete, but I think it is not, it becomes a problem whether to use a period or a comma: that is to say, there is inevitably a subjective component here. However, if one can consider both structure and meaning, in most cases, it can be decided whether to use a period or a comma, and the remaining ambiguous cases are not too many. The inappropriate use of periods and commas that is often seen now is probably only a small minority of cases where a wrong decision was made after consideration; most are simply the result of carelessness and randomly placing the marks.

    The general tendency now is to use too few periods and too many commas; in many places, sentences should or could be broken up, but the author only uses commas to separate them. The following three sentences should each be divided into three sentences:

    (1) When I was injured, I really didn't want to live anymore. I thought I only had one leg, and I wouldn't be able to catch up to the gate when begging for food. Who knew that the country would be so good to us, providing food and clothing appropriate for the time and season, truly better than home. (Newspaper)

    (2) To this end, cadres of women's federations at all levels must first study and become familiar with the Marriage Law, and conduct publicity and explanation of the Marriage Law among the masses in a planned way. The women's federations have the responsibility to put forward their own suggestions and amendments to deviations and incorrect ideas in the implementation of the Marriage Law. In areas where land reform has not yet been carried out and the masses have not yet been mobilized, the awareness of the masses must be taken into account when implementing the Marriage Law, and it should not be rushed. At present, the important thing is to publicize and explain the Marriage Law and prepare for the conditions for gradual implementation. (Newspaper)

    (3) At present, in the process of restoring and developing the economy in North China, the development of trade is a central link. The most urgent issue today is to sell the large quantities of grain, cotton, peanuts, vegetable oil, and agricultural and sideline products such as furs, bristles, eggs, pork, casings, straw braid, bamboo ware, ironware, and ceramics, as well as large quantities of mountain products, produced by farmers, and exchange them for the daily necessities they need, such as kerosene, cloth, waterwheels, agricultural tools, chemical fertilizers, and other necessities of life. If this cannot be done, rural production will be hindered, and the purchasing power of farmers will be greatly reduced, which will lead to the decline and stagnation of urban industry and commerce. (Newspaper)

    (1) The second and fourth commas should be changed to periods. (A comma should be added after "thought.") (2) The fourth and sixth commas should be changed to periods. (The tenth comma can be changed to a semicolon.) (3) The second and fifth commas should be changed to periods. These three sentences can represent the general situation. To talk about extreme examples, we once saw a typewritten and mimeographed document with a paragraph of more than 950 words, with 95 commas in the middle and only one period at the end. According to our analysis, it can be divided into 18 sentences, or at least 11 sentences.

    In the following two examples, one comma should be changed to a period, and one period should be changed to a comma. This proves what was said above, that most writers are casual about using periods or commas and do not give it much thought.

    (4) We do not deny that due to the backwardness of China's industrial development, some domestic products are not as good as foreign products in terms of quality, this is a fact. But this is precisely the result of long-term economic aggression by imperialism. (Newspaper)

    (5) How is this proven? First of all, it is reflected in the trademarks. Obviously, the goods are manufactured by Chinese manufacturers themselves, and the target customers are the Chinese masses, but they prefer to imitate the trademarks of foreign merchants and pretend to be foreign goods. Or they use Western text on trademarks, instructions, packaging paper, and brochures, without even a single Chinese character. (Newspaper)

    (4) Putting "this is a fact" in the previous sentence is structurally and meaningfully redundant; it would be much better at the beginning of the next sentence. A period should be used before it, and a comma after it. (5) A period should not be used after "foreign goods"; a comma is enough. Instead, a period should be used after "reflected in the trademarks."

    Using a comma where a period should be used can sometimes affect the correct understanding of the meaning. For example:

    (6) The completion of [this film] is attributed to the collective strength, the artistic leadership of the Film Bureau, the assistance of the original author of the stage play, and the wholehearted devotion of all the cast and crew to their work, all of which are new experiences for me. (Journal) The comma after "collective strength" naturally leads the reader to regard the following "leadership," "assistance," etc., as the object of "attributed to," but the author uses the latter as the subject of "all of which are." A period should be used after "strength." Another example is the provision of Article 16 of the Labor Insurance Regulations (as published in the People's Daily):

    (7) A. Female workers and female staff members who give birth are granted a total of 56 days of leave before and after childbirth. During the maternity leave, wages are paid as usual. B. Female workers and female staff members who have a miscarriage are granted 15 days of leave if the pregnancy is within three months; and 30 days of leave if the pregnancy is more than three months but less than seven months. During the maternity leave, wages are paid as usual. (Newspaper)

    A period should be used before "During the maternity leave." Using a comma in item A here does not cause any problems. In item B, because a semicolon has already been used in the preceding text, using a comma here can lead to the misunderstanding that "During the maternity leave, wages are paid as usual" refers specifically to those who are granted 30 days of leave, whereas according to the spirit of the entire article, it should include those who are granted 15 days of leave.

    Is there a reverse deviation, i.e., dividing what should be a single sentence into several sentences? Of course, there may be, but we have not encountered such examples. Sometimes one encounters a series of short sentences, such as:

    (8) In fact, everything has changed. Cheng the Madman is no longer mad. Ding Si, who did not work hard, has become a good worker. The running dog has mended his ways. The Longxugou, which was originally as stagnant as a pool of dead water, has become boiling. (Newspaper) These five sentences could be combined into one sentence (using a colon and three commas). However, the author punctuated it this way probably after consideration, because he wants to use short sentences to give a strong impression. We cannot say he is wrong, although another person might use different punctuation.

    Even if the latter sentence is structurally part of the former sentence, if the author has a reason to separate them, it cannot be considered wrong. For example:

    (9) His report this time was very short. But it was very important. (Work)

    (10) The people's regime attached great importance to translation work from the very beginning. Especially Russian translation work. (Journal) Breaking the sentence this way indicates a longer pause when speaking. Separating "But it was very important" into another sentence indeed makes it seem more important than combining it with the previous sentence; similarly, the power of "especially" is increased by the pause. However, this kind of punctuation should never be used indiscriminately.

    Whether to use commas. Using commas to divide paragraphs within a sentence on the one hand reflects pauses in speech, and on the other hand must meet structural needs. In most cases, these two are unified, but there are also times when they contradict each other. Sometimes, if commas are only used where structure requires them, the number of words included in between may be too many, making it a bit difficult to read in one breath; but if pauses in speech, no matter how small, are all marked with commas, it can make the sentence seem fragmented, which can make it difficult to understand the structural relationship of the sentence. Like this sentence:

    (11) At present, our country's financial and economic situation has just begun to improve, various difficulties have not been completely overcome, and the People's Liberation War has not yet completely ended, yet we are holding labor insurance, which proves that only our own country can care for and cherish our workers in this way. (Newspaper) A total of seven commas are used. Structurally speaking, only four (the second, third, fifth, and sixth) are enough. Now that three more are used, it feels a bit fragmented, and it is also not very clear how many paragraphs the meaning of this sentence is divided into. But if the last comma is removed, the clause starting with "which proves" becomes a bit difficult to read. If a comma is used within this clause, structurally speaking, it should be used after "proves," but the author uses it after "country," because he did not pause after "proves," but had to pause after "country." Another sentence:

    (12) These facts have been fully exposed in the Chinese people's movement to resist the United States and aid Korea, and in the movement of all faculty, students, and staff in colleges and universities that accepted US subsidies to oppose Austin's slander. (Journal) This sentence has a total of 51 words, with no commas in between. Structurally, there is indeed no place to put a comma. But it is indeed a bit difficult to read 51 words in one breath. In practice, one would pause two or three times after "facts," after the first "movement," after "colleges" or "staff," and after "in the movement." But adding commas in these places does not seem very appropriate.

    It is sometimes not easy to balance both sides, so it is difficult to define some uniform and unambiguous rules for the use of commas. Our idea is that although writing represents speech, since it is written on paper, it is mainly for reading, and taking care of structural relationships may be more helpful for understanding. (Someone has done a test: when reading aloud, a pause is needed every 11 or 12 words; when reading silently, one pause can handle more than 20 words. In other words, the paragraphs used when thinking are twice as long as the paragraphs used when breathing.) Therefore, in places where it is optional to use a comma or not, it is better to use one or two fewer commas. The following are some specific situations for discussion.

    Between clauses. Between clauses, if it is not yet to the point of needing a semicolon or colon, a comma is generally used to separate them. This is too common to need an example. What should be noted is that between two very short clauses, a comma is often not used, for example:

    (13) You reap what you sow.

    (14) Too much fire will cause burning, too much salt will cause bitterness. In (13), no comma is added after the first "melon" and the first "bean." In (14), no comma is added after the two "too much."

    Between subject and predicate. Structurally, the subject and predicate cannot be separated. But when the subject is very long, a comma is generally added. For example:

    (15) Wang Yongtai, the foreman of the shoemaking group in the shoe-making department of a certain leather factory and a special agent, not only frequently attacked advanced elements among the workers and undermined worker unity, but also... (Newspaper) In the following three sentences, (16) is optional, while (17) and (18) are absolutely unnecessary:

    (16) In popularizing and deepening the movement to resist the United States and aid Korea, people's radio stations and their radio networks throughout the country have played a huge role in propaganda and education. (Newspaper)

    (17) Philosophical thought is also a branch of ideological struggle. (Book)

    (18) Yongxing Electric Factory also made its own acid-based storage mine lamps. (Journal) The commas in the following two sentences make the structural relationship unclear, hindering the understanding of meaning:

    (19) I realized that my past understanding of the Communist Party was completely wrong.

    (20) All newly published works, after investigation by the "Book Selection Committee," are purchased if they are progressive books needed by readers. (Journal) (19) Causes the reader to have a preliminary misunderstanding: "I realized that my past understanding of the Communist Party". Only after finishing reading does one realize that this is not what the author meant. (20) The initial meaning is a bit ambiguous. "All newly published works" and "progressive books needed by readers" both seem like the subject of "are purchased." Removing the first comma makes it clear. (Here, the word "are" can be added. The comma under "books" is optional.) The subjects of the following two sentences, although very short, have some reason to be broken up:

    (21) This is not something that can be done in a day or two. (Work)

    (22) All of this has paved the way for the smooth implementation of this unprecedented Huai River harnessing spring project. (Newspaper) (21) Is equivalent to saying: "Speaking of this matter, that is not something that can be done in a day or two." To express this tone, it is right to add a comma after "this." (22) Without a comma, "all of this" may be misunderstood as an adjunct.

    Between verb and object. The structural relationship between verb and object is also very close. Only when the object is a rather long sentence form do we add a comma after the verb. If the object is a phrase, no matter how long, we still do not separate it with a comma. The following three sentences use a comma after "admit," "know," and "respond," which is inappropriate:

    (23) We must admit these bad trends and phenomena, and we must immediately think of ways to correct them. (Journal)

    (24) We already know that the British war economy has caused the prices of consumer goods to soar and the people's lives to deteriorate, while at the same time, the profits of British capitalists are increasing. (Newspaper)

    (25) Now, under the call of the Shanghai General Labor Union, the employed workers in Shanghai have responded one after another, donating one day's wages to relieve unemployed workers. (Newspaper) Adding a comma after the verb of the object gives us a psychological preparation to treat the following noun as the beginning of another sentence. When we see "and" and "while at the same time," we realize that this is not the case. (25) Is especially bad. It is easy to make people misunderstand that "movement" is the object of "relieve." By the time they realize that this doesn't make sense and go back to find "respond," they have already racked their brains. (In example 24, instead of removing the comma after "know," it would be better to delete the useless three words "the fact.")

    After "ba," "bei," "shi," etc. These verbs are necessarily followed by a noun (or pronoun) plus another verb. Although these constructions cannot be treated uniformly when analyzing sentences (see section "Complex Predicates" in section 4 of Lecture 1), there is no question that their following two components are done in one breath. It is now common to see a comma used between the noun and the second verb after these verbs, for example:

    (26) It makes me want to tell all the things to my country's friends. (Newspaper)

    (27) These things have been revered as priceless treasures by those who are obsessed with bones. (Work)

    (28) But it was these six people who made the sixteen American soldiers who rushed to the front prisoners. (Newspaper) The commas in these three sentences should be removed.

    Adjuncts and conjunctions at the beginning of sentences. Adjuncts at the beginning of sentences, such as "secondly," "finally," "on the other hand," "October 19th," "in Korea," etc., are paused when speaking, and it is correct to use commas to indicate this. But words like "today," "now," "recently," "here," etc., may not have a pause when speaking, so it should be considered when writing, and it is not necessary to add commas to all of them. The first comma in the following example can be omitted:

    (29) Now, the amount of currency is not too much. If compared with before the War of Resistance, it can still be increased by more than ten times. (Journal)

    (30) Just now, I saw him in the dormitory. (Work) Conjunctions at the beginning of sentences or clauses, such as "so," "therefore," "but," "however," may or may not have a pause when speaking. When writing, it is best to follow the principle of not adding a comma unless necessary (for example, when the following is also a conjunction, such as "but if," "so even if"). In the following examples, the commas after these conjunctions can largely be omitted:

    (31) Everyone looks down on the American aggressor troops, but everyone advises each other not to underestimate the enemy. (Newspaper)

    (32) But we must also take into account the purchasing power of consumers and the profits of merchants, otherwise, things will not be sold. (Journal)

    (33) At that time, the Shaanxi section of the Longhai Railway was still open to traffic, but the coal from Henan could not come, so the coal mining industry also developed. (Journal) There is even less reason to add a comma after "because" and "although," as there is no pause when speaking.

    (34) And the most important thing is because these three agreements are all aimed at developing China's economic construction. (Newspaper)

    (35) Although I know this is a problem, "keeping my head down and not saying anything" has become a habit. (Newspaper) It is especially wrong to use a comma after "although," because the reader may misunderstand it as a literary usage, equivalent to "although so," which is completely different from the original meaning. Lack of commas.

    As mentioned above, the general tendency is to use too many commas. But it is not that there are no examples of not using a comma when it should be used, it's just that there are fewer of them. Such as:

    (36) The parade has workers, farmers, the People's Liberation Army, students, etc., converging on Tiananmen Square from all directions. (Work)

    (37) We must and will be able to implement the resolutions of this meeting one by one based on the needs of the people and the actual conditions. (Newspaper)

    (36) A comma must be added after "etc." (37) A comma should also be added after "conditions" to give this longer sentence a pause. ("Ba" should be changed to "shi", otherwise "jian" should be changed to "fu".)

    Do commas affect the meaning. Sometimes, having or not having a comma can cause the meaning of a sentence to change more or less. For example:

    (38) Those classmates, even I look down on.

    (39) Those classmates even look down on me. The meaning of these two sentences is far apart. Another example:

    (40) I know you haven't been there.

    (41) I know you haven't been there.

    The main meaning of (40) is "I know," and the main meaning of (41) is "You haven't been there." Compare these two sentences again:

    (42) "I'm leaving," she suddenly stood up and said. (Newspaper)

    (43) "How is it, are you angry?" Zhang Xiuying asked with a smile. (Newspaper)

    (42) Is correct, because here are two actions that are narrated one after another, not a description of the posture of speaking. In contrast, (43) obviously uses "smiling" to describe the expression of asking a question, and the author is wrong to separate it with a comma.

    The following four sentences all use one too many commas, thus producing a meaning that does not match the author's original intention:

    (44) The Palestinian High Commissioner will change the death sentences of several Jews to imprisonment. (Newspaper)

    (45) After folk painters participate in slideshow work, they should understand their work process, which is their transformation process. (Newspaper)

    (46) Later, they found the entrance to the tunnel, so they asked the puppet army to go down first to block the attack. (Book)

    (44) Those sentenced to death were the Jews. Adding a comma makes people suspect that several non-Jews were sentenced to death, while all Jews had their sentences changed to imprisonment. (45) What "should understand" is "their work process is their transformation process." Separating it with a comma is as if one only needs to understand "their work process," and "their transformation process" becomes a commentary. (46) The author's intention is: later, every time the Japanese army found a tunnel, they would ask the puppet army to go down first. Having a comma turns it into a one-time event and cannot express a habitual behavior.

    The following two sentences are the opposite, missing a comma:

    (47) Chairman Mao once said that Lu Xun was a "modern Chinese sage." (Journal)

    (48) Before leaving, they gave them many gifts and asked them to say, "Be sure to come again next year." (Newspaper)

    (47) Needs a comma, because the main meaning of this sentence is "Lu Xun is...a sage" (compare example 41 above). (48) The original intention was "asked them, said...", but missing a comma means that it was not the host saying this, but asking the guests to say it. (A better way to revise this sentence is to remove the word "say.")

    语法、修辞讲话
    吕叔湘、朱德熙
    第六讲    标点
    中央人民政府出版总署制订的“标点符号用法”，已经刊布在今年九月二十六日的人民日报上。这里面对于各种标点符号的用法都已经举例说明，我们这一讲就不再在使用这些符号的基本规律上多说话，只挑出一些容易发生问题的情形来谈谈。
    关于标点符号，有一个很流行但是很错误的看法，这个看法具体表现在“加标点”这句话上。事实上，也很有些人把一段甚至一篇文章写完了，然后在旁边加上一些符号。这样办，就是没有能充分利用标点符号。
    我们必须首先有一个认识：标点符号是文字里面的有机的部分，不是外面加上去的。它跟旧式的句读号不同，不仅是怕读者读不断，给它指点指点的。每一个标点符号有一个独特的作用，说它们是另一形式的虚字，也不为过分。应该把它们和“和”“的”“呢”“吗”同样看待，用与不用，用在哪里，都值得斟酌一番。起腹稿的时候，应该想到词语就同时想到标点；动笔写的时候，也是连文字带标点往纸上写。特别重要的是要有句子的观念。要想好这个句子到哪个字为止，然后动笔写第一个字，写完了用句号打住。
    甚至可以说，自从有了标点符号，文章的风格也受到了影响。最显著的，有了问号，“吗”和“呢”可以少用许多；有了引号，“某某说”可以少用许多；有了省略号，从前必须加以注解甚至叹为神妙之笔的“半句头话”（如红楼梦九十八回黛玉临死时的“宝玉！宝玉！你好……”）也了不足奇了。从这些地方，可以悟出标点符号的作用不仅仅是“断句”，因而也就应该充分加以利用。
    标点符号极容易排错，校对的时候也极容易放过，下文所举的书刊中标点不妥的例句，难免有跟作者原稿不符的。举一个例，在今年二月四日的光明日报上有这么一段文字：
    中共市委书记彭真同志指示：首都市政建设，应该有群众观点，群众路线，东西城一带历来为市政建设注意中心，而群众居住甚多所常来常往的地方，过去反动政府倒是从来不放在眼里，因而我们人民的市政建设计划，首先要替生产者劳动人民着想，明显的区别于反动政权的都市建设方针，让我们首先消灭掉北京历来统治阶级从来不去从来不管的肮脏臭沟——龙须沟。这一句显然太长，应该分成几句。在同一天的人民日报上也有这一段文字，就在“路线”之后，“眼里”之后，“方针”之后，不用逗号而用句号。如果我们把光明日报的引来做例，就是冤枉了作者。可是哪里能每句都找得着校勘的材料呢？就只能凭书刊上的样子说话了。有些写文章的人写标点符号常常随笔轻轻一带，不容易辨别，这也是增加错误的原因。唯其标点符号的个儿小，更应该写得清楚；要跟文字一样清楚，甚至比文字还要清楚才好。
    第一段    句号、逗号
    句号的形式。句号的形式是个小圈儿。西文标点符号里的句号是个小圆点，许多人在中文里也就仿效办理。虽然排字房里会把它改成圈儿，可是因为圆点和顿号、逗号都极容易混淆，排错的机会就增加了。所以原稿上最好还是用圈不用点。
    在一句之末是一个西文字或是数目字的时候，有人主张用点不用圈，怕那个圈让人误会是字母“O”或数目字“零”。假如标点符号一律偏右，这个误会是可以避免的。
    句和逗的分别。句号表示一句话完了之后的停顿，逗号表示一句话中间的停顿。（表示句子中间的停顿的还有几种符号，不过它们都有比较专门的职司，只有逗号是一般性的。）这个分别好像很明显，可是实际应用起来并不如想像的简单。一句话，你说是完了，我看是没有完，究竟该用句号还是该用逗号就成问题：这就是说，这里免不了有主观的成分。不过如果能从结构和意义两方面去考虑，大多数情形是可以决定该用句号还是该用逗号，剩下的两可的情形是不太多的。现在常看见的句号和逗号用得不妥，恐怕只有少数是经过考虑而作了错误的决定，大多数只是无所用心，随随便便地点下去的结果。
    现在的一般倾向是句号用得太少，逗号用得太多；很多地方都应该或可以断句而作者只用逗号隔开的。像下面这三句，都是每句应该分作三句的：
    （一）受伤的时候，真不想活了，我寻思只有一条腿，要饭吃也赶不上大门，谁知国家对我们这样好，到什么时候吃什么饭，到什么季节换什么衣裳，真是比家还强。（报）
    （二）为此，各地妇联干部首先要深入学习，熟习婚姻法，有计划地在群众中进行婚姻法的宣传解释工作，对执行婚姻法中之偏差和不正确思想，妇联有责任提出自己的建议和修正意见，在土地改革尚未进行，群众尚未发动的地区，执行婚姻法时更要估计到群众的觉悟，不可操之过急，目前重要的还是宣传解释婚姻法，准备逐渐实行的条件。（报）
    （三）目前华北在恢复和发展经济过程中，贸易工作的开展是一个中心环节，今天最迫切的问题，就是把农民为数很大的粮食、棉花、花生、植物油和农副产品如皮毛、猪鬃、鸡蛋、猪肉、肠衣、草帽辫、竹器、铁器、陶瓷器等和大批山货推销出去，并给农民换回他们所需要的日用必需品如煤油、布匹、水车、农具、化学肥料及其他生活资料，如果这一点办不到，农村生产就会被阻滞，农民购买力就会大大降低，因而城市工商业也就会消沉迟滞起来。（报）
    （一）应该把第二个和第四个逗号改做句号。（“寻思”底下应加逗号。）（二）应该把第四个和第六个逗号改做句号。（第十个逗号可改用分号。）（三）应该把第二个和第五个逗号改做句号。这三句可以代表一般的情况。要讲极端的例子，我们曾经看到过一本打字油印的文件，有一段有九百五十多个字，中间用了九十五个逗号，最后才有一个句号。照我们分析，可以分成十八句，至少也该分成十一句。
    下面两个例子里各有一个逗号该改做句号，同时也有一个句号该改做逗号。这可以证明上面所说，多数写作者对于用句号还是用逗号是随随便便，不去多考虑的。
    （四）我们并不否认由于中国产业发展的落后，某些国货在品质上不及外货优良，这是事实。但这正是帝国主义长期经济侵略的结果。（报）
    （五）这从哪些方面得到证明呢？首先，就表现在商标上，明明是中国厂商自己制造的商品，顾客对象亦是中国人民大众，但他们却偏喜欢仿造一个外商的商标，冒充洋货。或者在商标上、说明上、包装纸以及仿单上使用西文，甚至连一个中国字也没有。（报）
    （四）把“这是事实”放在上一句，在结构上和意思上都是赘余；放在下一句头上就好得多。应该在它前面用句号，在它后面用逗号。（五）“洋货”之后不该断句，一个逗号尽够了。倒是“表现在商标上”之后该用句号。
    该用句号的地方用逗号，有时候要影响意义的正确了解。例如：
    （六）〔这个影片〕所以能够完成都归功于集体的力量，电影局艺术的领导，舞台剧原作者的协助，全体演职员全心全意投入工作，都是我从未经过的新经验。（期）“集体的力量”后面用逗号，读者自然把底下的“领导”“协助”等等都当作“归功于”的宾语，但作者是把后者用做“都是”的主语的。应该在“力量”之后断句。又如劳动保险条例第十六条的规定（照人民日报所载）：
    （七）甲、女工人与女职员生育，产前产后共给假五十六日，产假期间，工资照发。乙、女工人与女职员小产，怀孕在三个月以内者，给假十五日；在三个月以上不满七个月者，给假三十日，产假期间，工资照发。（报）
    “产假期间”之前应该用句号。甲项在这里用逗号还不发生问题。乙项因为上文已经有过分号，这里用逗号，叫人误会“产假期间，工资照发”是专指给假三十日者，而按整个条文的精神，应该包括给假十五日者。
    有没有相反的偏差，就是该合成一句而分成几句的呢？当然也会有的，不过我们还没有遇到这样的例子。有时候会遇到一连串的短句子，如：
    （八）事实上是一切都变化了。程疯子不疯了。不好好干活的丁四变成一个好的工人了。狗腿子改邪归正了。原来像死水一样停滞的龙须沟变得沸腾起来了。（报）这里的五个句子未尝不可以合成一句（用一个冒号和三个逗号）。可是作者这样标点大约是经过考虑的，他要使用短句子，予人以强劲的印象。我们就不能说他错，虽然在另外一个人的笔底下会有不同的标点法。
    甚至后一句在结构上明明是前一句的一部分，如果作者有理由把它分开，也不能算他错。例如：
    （九）他这一次的报告很短。但是很重要。（作）
    （十）人民政权从一开始就很重视翻译工作。尤其是俄文翻译工作。（期）这样断句，表示说的时候有一较大的停顿。“但是很重要”另作一句，的确比合在上句显得更重要；同样，“尤其”的力量也因停顿而增加。但是这种标点法决不可乱用。
    逗号要不要？用逗来划分句子内部的段落，一方面是反映说话的停顿，一方面也要符合结构的需要。以大多数情形而论，这两样是合一的，可也不是没有矛盾的时候。有时候，如果只在结构需要的地方用逗号，可能中间包括的字数太多，一口气念下去有点吃力；可是如果把说话时候的停顿，不论大小，一一用逗号标明，又会使人觉得支离破碎，反而闹不清楚这句话的结构关系。像这一句：
    （十一）目前我们国家的财政经济状况，刚刚开始好转，各种困难还未完全克服，人民解放战争，尚未完全结束，就来举办劳动保险了，这就证明只有我们自己的国家，才能这样的关心和爱护我们工人。（报）一共用了七个逗点。单讲结构，只要有四个（第二个，第三个，第五个，第六个）就够了。现在多用了三个，就觉得有点零碎，而且这一句的意思到底分几个段落也不很显明。可是如果把最后一个逗号取消，从“这就证明”起这一个分句念起来就有点吃力。要是在这个分句里面用一个逗号，按结构说应该用在“证明”之后，但是作者用在“国家”之后，那是因为他在“证明”之后没有打个停，到了“国家”之后就非停不可了。另外一句：
    （十二）这些事实已经在中国人民抗美援朝运动及接受美国津贴的高等学校全体师生员工反对奥斯汀谰言的运动中揭露无遗了。（期）这一句一共五十一个字，中间没有一个逗号。论结构，确是没有地方安得下一个逗号。但是一口气念五十一个字也的确有点为难，实际上会在“事实”之后，第一个“运动”之后，“学校”或“员工”之后，“运动中”之后，停顿两次或三次。可是如果在这些地方加上逗号，看起来又不很合式。
    双方兼顾有时候是不容易的，所以关于逗号的用法也就难于定出一些划一不二的条文来。我们的想法，文章虽然代表说话，可是既已写在纸上，就以看为主，照顾结构关系也许更有助于了解。（有人做过测验：读出声音来，十一二个字就需要停顿；默读，一个停顿可以管二十多个字。换句话说，用脑的段落比呼吸的段落有加倍的长。）因此，在可用可不用的地方，还是少用一两个逗号为宜。下面提出几种具体的情况来讨论一下。
    分句和分句之间。    分句和分句之间，如果还不到需要用分号或冒号的程度，一般用逗号隔开。这太普通了，不用举例。要注意的是两个很短的分句之间往往连逗号也不用，例如：
    （十三）种瓜得瓜，种豆得豆。
    （十四）火大了要焦，盐多了发苦。（十三）的第一个“瓜”字和第一个“豆”字底下都不加逗号。（十四）的两个“了”字底下也不加逗号。
    主语和谓语之间。    在结构上，主语和谓语是不能划断的。可是在主语很长的时候，一般加个逗号。例如：
    （十五）某制革厂制鞋部作面组工长特务分子王永泰，不仅经常打击工人中的先进分子，破坏工人团结，而且……（报）下面这三句里面，（十六）是可用可不用的，（十七）和（十八）就绝对用不着：
    （十六）在普及和深入抗美援朝运动中，全国各地人民广播电台及其收音网，发挥了极大的宣传教育作用。（报）
    （十七）哲学思想，也是思想斗争的一个部门。（书）
    （十八）永兴电工厂，还自制了酸性蓄电矿灯。（期）下面这两句里的逗号使结构关系不清楚，妨害意义的了解：
    （十九）体会到过去对于共产党的认识，是完全错误的。
    （二十）所有新出版作品，经过“图书选购委员会”的调查，凡是读者需要的进步书籍，都在购买之列。（期）（十九）使读者先有一个错误的了解：“体会到过去对于共产党的认识”。等到看完了，才知道作者不是这个意思。（二十）初读意思有点含胡，“所有新出版作品”和“凡是读者需要的进步书籍”都像是“都在购买之列”的主语。把第一个逗号取消就清楚了。（这里可以加个“都”字。“书籍”底下的逗号可用可不用。）下面这两句的主语，虽然很短，有点断的理由：
    （二一）这，也不是一天两天就能做好的事。（作）
    （二二）所有这一切，为顺利进行这一空前规模的治淮春季工程铺平了道路。（报）（二一）等于说：“要讲这件事，那也不是一天两天就能做好的。”为了表示这种语气，“这”字后面加逗号是对的。（二二）如果没有逗号，“所有这一切”有被人误解为附加语的可能。
    动词和宾语之间。
    动词和宾语之间的结构关系也是很密切的。只有宾语是个相当长的句子形式的时候，我们才在动词之后加一个逗号。如果宾语是个短语，尽管相当长，还是不用逗号把它隔开。下面这三句在“承认”“知道”“响应”之后用逗号是不妥的：
    （二三）我们必须承认，这些不好的趋势和现象，而且必须马上想法子加以纠正。（期）
    （二四）我们已经知道，英国备战经济使消费品的价格飞涨、人民生活日益恶化的事实，而在同时，英国大资本家们的利润却在增加着。（报）
    （二五）现在上海全市的在业工人，在上海总工会的号召下，已纷纷响应，捐助一天工资来救济失业工人的运动。（报）在宾语的动词后面加逗号，我们心理上就有了一种准备，把底下的名词当作另一句话的起头。等到看见“而且”和“而在同时”，才知道不是这回事。（二五）尤其不好，很容易使人误会“运动”是“救济”的宾语，等到悟过来这是讲不通的，再回上去找着“响应”，已经伤了脑筋了。（二四例与其取消“知道”后面的逗号，毋宁删去无用的“的事实”三字。）
    “把”“被”“使”等字之后。这些动词的后面必然跟一个名词（或代词）加上另一个动词。尽管在分析句子的时候这些构造不能一律看待（见第一讲第四段“复杂的谓语”节），它们的后随的两个成分是一气呵成，这是没有问题的。现在常看见在这些动词后面的名词和第二动词之间加用逗号，例如：
    （二六）它使我想把一切东西，都告诉给我祖国的朋友们。（报）
    （二七）这些东西都曾经被那些迷恋骸骨的人们，崇奉为无价的珍宝。（作）
    （二八）但正是这六个人还使冲到面前的十六个美国兵，做了俘虏。（报）这三句的逗号都应该取消。
    句子头上的附加语和连接词。    句子头上的附加语，像“其次”“最后”“另一方面”“十月十九日”“在朝鲜”等等，说话的时候是停一停的，用逗号来表示是对的。可是像“今天”“现在”“最近”“这里”等等，说的时候不一定有停顿，写起来也就应该斟酌，不一定都要加上逗号。下面例句里的第一个逗号可以不用：
    （二九）现在，通货数量并不算多，如果和抗战前比较，还可以增加十多倍。（期）
    （三十）刚才，我还看见他在宿舍里。（作）句子或分句头上的连接词，像“所以”“因此”“可是”“但是”这些，说的时候或停或不停，写的时候不妨以不加逗号为原则，有需要的时候才加上（例如底下又是一个连接词，像“但是如果”“所以即使”）。下面例句里，这些连接词后面的逗号是大可以不用的：
    （三一）大家都看不起美国侵略军，但是，大家又相诫不要轻敌。（报）
    （三二）但是还必须兼顾消费者的购买力和商人的利润，否则，东西一定卖不出去。（期）
    （三三）那时陇海路陕西一段还通车，而河南煤不能来，所以，采煤业也发展了。（期）“因为”和“虽然”说的时候并无停顿，更没有加逗号的道理。
    （三四）而最重要的，就是因为，这三个协定都以发展中国经济建设为目的。（报）
    （三五）虽然，知道这是一种毛病，可是“闷头儿不响”已经成了习惯。（报）“虽然”之后尤其不应该用逗号，因为读者可能误会是文言里的用法，等于“虽然如此”，跟原来的意思就完全两样了。缺少逗号。
    上面说过，一般的倾向是逗号用得太多。可也不是没有该用不用的例子，只是比较少罢了。如：
    （三六）游行队伍有工人、农民、解放军、学生等从四面八方向天安门汇合。（作）
    （三七）我们一定要也一定能够根据人民的需要和实际条件把这次会议的议决一件一件地见诸实现。（报）
    （三六）“等”字后面非加逗号不可。（三七）“条件”后也应该加个逗号，使这个较长的句子有个停顿。（“把”应改为“使”，否则“见”应改为“付”。）
    逗号有无影响意义。有时候，有一个逗号或是没有一个逗号，会使一句话的意义发生或多或少的变化。例如：
    （三八）那些同学们，连我都看不起。
    （三九）那些同学们连我都看不起。这两句的意思差远了。又如：
    （四十）我知道你没有去过。
    （四一）我知道，你没有去过。
    （四十）的主要意思是“我知道”，（四一）的主要意思就是“你没有去过”。再比较这两句：
    （四二）“我走了，”她突然站起来，说。（报）
    （四三）“怎样，生气啦？”张秀英笑着，问。（报）
    （四二）是对的，因为这里是叙述一先一后的两个动作，不是描写说话的姿势。和这相反，（四三）显然是用“笑着”来描写问话的神情的，作者用逗号隔开就不对了。
    下面这四句都多用了一个逗号，因此产生与作者原意不符的意义：
    （四四）巴勒斯坦高级委员将若干判死刑，犹太人改处徒刑。（报）
    （四五）在民间画匠参加幻灯工作后，应该了解他们的工作过程，就是他们的改造过程。（报）
    （四六）后来，他们发现了地道口，就叫伪军先下去挡头阵。（书）
    （四四）判死刑的就是犹太人。多了一个逗号，使人疑心是有若干非犹太人判了死刑，而所有犹太人都改处徒刑。（四五）“应该了解”的是“他们的工作过程就是他们的改造过程”。用逗号隔断，就好像只要了解“他们的工作过程”，“他们的改造过程”变了注解了。（四六）作者的意思是：后来日军每次发现地道就叫伪军先下去。有了一个逗号就变成只有一次的事实，不能表示是习惯性的行为了。
    下面这两句恰好相反，少了一个逗号：
    （四七）毛主席曾经说过鲁迅是一个“现代中国的圣人”。（期）
    （四八）临走送了他们许多礼物，还要求他们说：“明年一定再来。”（报）
    （四七）需要逗号，因为这一句的主要意思是“鲁迅是……圣人”（比较上面四一例）。（四八）原意是“要求他们，说………”，少了个逗号就不是主人自己这样说，而是要求客人这样说了。（这一句更好的改法是把“说”字去掉。）
