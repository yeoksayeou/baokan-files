    Liu Zhongxi, Militia Captain of Shahe County, Hebei
    Used Pretexts for Revenge, Forcing Worker Liu Xiaodong to Death
    He Has Been Arrested and Dealt with According to Law by the County People's Government
    The cadres of Nan Shigang Village in our county's Fourth District, Liu Zhongxi's style of forced commands and using pretexts for revenge is extremely bad and must be punished according to law.
    Nan Shigang Village held a mass meeting on the evening of July 11th. Workers who go down the kiln, Liu Xiaodong and Liu Kuiming, did not attend. Militia Captain Liu Zhongxi, in the past, wanted to marry the widow Bai Zhuling, but Bai Zhuling married Liu Xiaodong's second brother, Liu Erzheng. He was very dissatisfied with Liu Erzheng, so he used this opportunity to abuse his power for personal revenge, sending two militiamen to call Liu Xiaodong and Liu Kuiming to the meeting (calling Liu Kuiming was to cover up other people's eyes, mainly to strike at Liu Xiaodong), illegally conducting a "struggle session."
    The village's Communist Party Branch Secretary, Liu Shuan, was present and not only did not stop this act of revenge, but also helped Liu Zhongxi criticize Liu Xiaodong, causing Liu Xiaodong to be extremely frightened.
    After this, a letter came from the kiln asking Liu Xiaodong to go to the kiln, but the village's Public Security Officer, Liu Xiquan, used the excuse that the problem had not been resolved and refused to issue an introduction letter (at that time, kiln workers in the area needed to have a certificate from the village). Liu Shuan was present at the time and did not help resolve this issue. Liu Xiaodong thought the matter had become serious and was extremely panicked. After returning home, he hanged himself.
    After this serious incident occurred, the Shahe County People's Procuratorate immediately sent people to investigate and confirmed that Liu Xiaodong's suicide due to fear was true. The county has now arrested and dealt with Militia Captain Liu Zhongxi according to law. The County Procuratorate has suggested that the CCP Shahe County Committee give Liu Shuan appropriate punishment and suggested that the County Public Security Bureau give Liu Xiquan appropriate administrative punishment.

    河北沙河县民兵队长刘中喜
    借故报复逼死工人刘小东
    已被该县人民政府逮捕法办
    我县四区南石岗村干部刘中喜强迫命令和借故报复的作风十分恶劣，必须依法惩办。
    南石岗村在七月十一日晚召开群众大会，下窑工人刘小东、刘魁明没有参加。民兵队长刘中喜，过去因想和寡妇白柱灵结婚，而白柱灵却和刘小东的二哥刘二正结了婚。他很不满意刘二正，便利用这一机会，滥用职权进行私人报复，派了两个民兵将刘小东、刘魁明叫到会场上（叫刘魁明是为了遮盖别人眼目，主要是为了打击刘小东），非法地进行“斗争”。
    该村共产党支部书记刘拴在场，不但没有制止这种报复行为，反而帮着刘中喜批评刘小东，使刘小东恐惧万分。
    此后，窑上来信要刘小东上窑去，但该村公安员刘喜全却借口问题没有解决，不给开介绍信（那时期当地窑上工人都要开村上证明信），当时刘拴在场，也没有帮助解决这一问题。刘小东认为事情闹大了，恐慌到极点，回家后就上吊自杀了。
    这一严重事件发生后，沙河县人民检察署立即派人进行检查，证明刘小东因恐惧自杀属实。该县现已将民兵队长刘中喜逮捕法办。县检察署已建议中共沙河县委会予刘拴以适当处分，并建议县公安局予刘喜全以适当的行政处分。
