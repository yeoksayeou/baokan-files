Everyone Should Do Radio Calisthenics
中华全国体育总会筹备委员会广播体操研究小组 (Radio Calisthenics Research Group of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Athletic Federation)

    The radio calisthenics that the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Athletic Federation and the Broadcasting Administration jointly decided to promote this time is a relatively simple and continuous set of freehand exercises. It possesses the general basic functions of freehand exercises for physical training.

    Freehand exercise is a kind of activity that maintains and promotes physical health and is the most basic part of physical exercise. Freehand exercises not only have the function of training physical strength and enhancing physical fitness, but also can cultivate people's foundation for other sports (such as track and field, ball sports, apparatus gymnastics, swimming, skating, etc.) as basic exercises and supplementary exercises for other sports. Because of its relatively gentle movements, it can also be used as a warm-up and cool-down exercise for other sports. Therefore, promoting freehand exercises will not only enable the broad masses of the people to maintain and improve their physical health, but also lay a good foundation for further extensive and in-depth development of national sports.

    Another characteristic of freehand exercise is its mass nature. Unlike some other sports that require specific venues, equipment, and apparatus, it can be practiced alone or by thousands of people simultaneously. In the past, because the reactionary rulers did not pay attention to the health of the people and turned sports into their exclusive pastime, this characteristic of freehand exercises has never been given its due play. Now, sports have become an effective tool for the people to exercise their bodies, and it will and must be able to better serve the health of the people. The Broadcasting Administration's decision to host radio calisthenics programs and use broadcasting to guide and promote calisthenics will enable this sport to gain a wider mass base.

    In order to enable the broad masses of people from all walks of life to participate in the exercise as much as possible, the physical and developmental conditions of people of different ages and genders and the actual situation that they generally lack physical training today have been taken into consideration as much as possible when compiling this set of radio calisthenics. Therefore, the movements of this set of exercises are generally specified to be relatively simple and easy to do. Despite this, this set of exercises still possesses the basic functions of freehand exercises. That is to say, as long as people do practice this exercise regularly, on time, and seriously, they will definitely be able to maintain and improve their physical health, and further strengthen their physical strength and fitness.

        This set of radio calisthenics is divided into ten sections, including lower limb and upper limb exercises, chest exercises, lateral exercises, abdominal and back exercises, average exercises, jumping exercises, and breathing exercises. According to the general laws of physical exercise and the requirements for rational exercise of various parts of the body in freehand exercises, the order of various exercises is arranged, and warm-up exercises and cool-down exercises are appropriately inserted. The first and second sections are warm-up exercises; the third to eighth sections are main exercises; and the ninth and tenth sections are cool-down exercises.

    The so-called warm-up exercise is the induction stage in the process of each physical exercise. It is to make the human body gradually enter an excited state from the original static state through fast, slow, strong, and weak movements, so that the muscles, joints, internal organs, breathing, and blood circulation, and other physiological organs and functions are prepared for the main exercise. The main exercise is generally the part of each physical exercise that contains relatively strong and intense movements. If you directly engage in more intense and strenuous movements without going through warm-up exercises, the body will be injured due to a lack of adaptability. This kind of warm-up exercise is even more important for strenuous sports such as track and field competitions, ball games, running, jumping, and throwing. The warm-up exercises for general freehand exercises are lower limb exercises, upper limb exercises, or limb exercises. The warm-up exercise of this set of radio calisthenics consists of a lower limb exercise and a limb exercise. The movements of these two sections, on the one hand, play the role of warm-up exercises for the main exercise, and on the other hand, as lower limb exercises and limb exercises, they can develop the muscles and bones of the upper and lower limbs, enhance the tenacity and flexibility of the joints, so as to cultivate people's ability to lift, bend, stretch, stand, walk, squat, and other upper and lower limb abilities that are indispensable in daily life.

    The main exercise of this set of calisthenics includes chest exercise, lateral exercise, abdominal and back exercise, average exercise, and jumping exercise. These exercises mostly involve all parts of the body; the intensity and amount of exercise are also relatively large. The main purpose of chest exercise is to increase the range of motion of the joints of the spine and ribs, promote the flexibility and elasticity of the chest wall, stimulate the function of the internal organs of the chest, especially the heart and lungs, and is of great benefit to the health of the blood circulation and respiratory systems. Chest exercise can also make the thoracic spine and thorax tend to normal development and correct the maldevelopment of deformities such as round back and narrow chest. This exercise is of great significance to the health of the chest and internal organs of young people who are developing and mental workers who often work at their desks. The fourth and fifth sections of the exercise are both lateral exercises. Lateral exercise is to promote the development of the muscles on the side of the chest and abdomen by means of lateral bending and twisting movements of the trunk, increase the resistance and mobility of the spine, prevent and correct deformities and pathological conditions of the spine, and also generate internal pressure in the abdomen, thereby stimulating the stomach, intestines, and other internal organs, and promoting the function of digestion, excretion, and blood circulation. Abdominal and back exercises can develop the muscles of the back and the front and sides of the abdominal wall, enliven the function of the internal organs of the digestive, respiratory, circulatory, and excretory systems, and can strengthen the abdominal muscles and balance the back muscles, which is conducive to maintaining the normal posture of the body and increasing the ability to support the body weight, which strengthens people's persistence in sitting, standing, walking, and running in work and life. Average exercise is to use slow and gentle whole-body exercise to enhance whole-body control and balance, develop the ability to change body position and muscle reaction ability, so that the body can tend to unified and coordinated development, and train the nervous system to a considerable extent. Jumping exercise is a whole-body exercise, which can not only make the muscles of the lower limbs developed, strong, and elastic, but also promote the function of internal organs and metabolism. The above are the basic functions of each section of the main exercise of this set of calisthenics.

    The purpose of cool-down exercises is to use lighter limb exercises and breathing exercises to gradually relax the whole body from an extremely excited state and gradually return to the static state at the beginning of the exercise after people have engaged in more intense and strenuous exercises, in order to maintain the health of the body. The ninth and tenth sections of this set of calisthenics are such cool-down exercises, in which the breathing exercise section can gradually strengthen the lungs and improve the respiratory organs due to deep breathing.

    From what has been said above, it can be seen that this set of calisthenics has the basic functions of calisthenics. It not only adapts to the needs of ordinary people in life and work for physical fitness, physical strength, and physical ability, and makes up for and corrects their deficiencies and deformities, but also is simple and easy to do. If we can practice regularly and seriously in accordance with the "Movement Instructions" and "Precautions" for this calisthenics, our health will definitely improve day by day.

    大家都来做广播体操
    中华全国体育总会筹备委员会广播体操研究小组
    这次中华全国体育总会筹备委员会和广播事业局联合决定推行的广播体操，是一部比较简易的、连续性的徒手体操。它具备了徒手体操的锻炼身体的一般基本性能。
    徒手体操是一种保持和促进身体健康的运动，是体育锻炼中最基本的部分。徒手体操不但具有锻炼体力，增进体能的功能，还能够培养人们进行其他各项体育运动（如田径运动、球类运动、器械体操、游泳、滑冰等）的基础，作为进行其他运动的基本练习和补助运动，并且又因为它的动作比较和缓还可以作为进行其他运动的准备运动和整理运动。所以提倡徒手体操实际上不仅将使广大人民的身体健康得以保持和增进，并且还将为进一步广泛和深入地开展国民体育运动打下良好的基础。
    徒手体操的另一个特点，在于它的群众性。它不像其他一些体育运动那样需要特定的场地设备和器械的限制；它既可单独练习，也可以千百人同时一起进行操练。过去，由于反动统治者根本不重视人民群众的健康，把体育运动变成了他们专有的消遣品，所以徒手体操的这个性能从来没有得到应有的发挥。现在体育运动已经成为人民群众自己的锻炼身体的有效工具，它将会也一定能够更好地为人民的健康服务。广播事业局决定举办广播体操的节目，利用广播来领导和推广体操运动，将使这个运动获得更广泛的群众性。
    为了使各阶层广大人民群众尽量参加操练，在编制这部广播体操的时候，尽可能地照顾了不同年龄、性别的人们的身体和发育的条件和他们今天一般还缺乏体育训练的实际情况。所以，这部体操的动作一般规定得比较简单易行。尽管这样，这部体操依然是具备了徒手体操的基本功能。这就是说，人们只要确实认真地按时并经常地实行这个体操的锻炼，那就一定能够保持和增进身体的健康，并进而加强体力和体能。
        这部广播体操共分十节，包括了下肢和上肢运动、胸运动、体侧运动、腹背运动、平均运动、跳跃运动和呼吸运动等。它按照一般体育锻炼进行的规律和徒手体操练习中身体各部位合理锻炼的要求，排定了各种运动的顺序，并且适当地插入了准备运动和整理运动。它的第一、第二两节是准备运动；第三节至第八节是主运动；第九、第十两节是整理运动。
    所谓准备运动，是每一次体育锻炼进行过程中的诱导阶段，是要使人体从原来的静止状态经过快、慢、强、弱适度的动作，将人体的肌肉、关节、内脏、呼吸和血液循环等生理器官和机能导入兴奋状态，以为进行主运动的准备。主运动一般是每一次体育锻炼过程中包含比较强烈和紧张的动作的部分。如果不经过准备运动而径行进行较强烈和紧张的动作，则将会因身体缺乏适应能力而使身体遭受损伤。这种准备运动对于进行田径赛、球类的跑、跳、投等剧烈的运动更为重要。一般徒手体操的准备运动是下肢运动或上肢运动或四肢运动。这部广播体操的准备运动是由一节下肢运动和一节四肢运动所组成。这两节的动作，一方面起着对于主运动的准备运动的作用，另一方面，作为下肢运动和四肢运动，又能够发达上下肢的肌肉和骨骼，增强各关节的坚韧性和柔软性，从而养成人们日常生活中不可缺少的举、屈、伸、立、走、蹲等上下肢的能力。
    这部体操的主运动包括了胸运动、体侧运动、腹背运动、平均运动和跳跃运动。这些运动大都牵涉全身各部位；动作的强度和运动量也比较大。胸运动的主要目的是增加脊椎、肋骨各关节的活动范围，促进胸壁的柔软性及弹性，刺激胸部内脏，尤其是心脏和肺脏发挥机能，对血液循环和呼吸系统的健康有很大的裨益。胸运动还能使胸椎和胸廓趋向正常发展，矫正圆背、狭胸等畸形的不良发育状况。这个运动对于正在发育中的青年和经常伏案工作的脑力劳动者的胸部及内脏的健康有很重要的意义。体操的第四、第五节都是体侧运动。体侧运动是借躯干的侧屈、侧转动作，促使胸侧、腹侧的肌肉发达，增加脊柱的抵抗力和能动性，预防及矫正脊柱的畸形病态，还能产生腹部的内压力，从而刺激胃肠等内脏，促进消化、排泄及血液循环的机能。腹背运动能发达背部和腹壁前面及侧面的肌肉，活泼消化、呼吸、循环及排泄系统的内脏器官的机能，并能使腹肌强健，背肌平衡，因而利于保持身体的正常姿势，增进支持身重的能力，这就加强了人们在工作和生活中的坐、立、走、跑的持久性。平均运动是利用徐缓的全身运动，以增进全身支配力和平衡力，发达身体位置变换能力和肌肉反应能力，使身体能趋于统一调和的发展，并相当地训练神经系统。跳跃运动是全身运动，它不但可使下肢的肌肉发达强韧和富有弹力，并能促进内脏的机能和新陈代谢作用。以上是这部体操的主运动各节的基本功能。
    整理运动的目的是当人们进行了较激烈紧张的运动之后用较轻松的四肢运动和呼吸运动，使全身由极兴奋的状态逐渐松弛，逐渐恢复运动开始时的静止状态，以维护身体的健康。这部体操的第九、第十两节就是这样的整理运动，其中呼吸运动一节由于是进行深呼吸，还能逐渐加强肺脏、健全呼吸器官。
    从前面所说到的可以看出：这部体操具备了体操运动的基本功能。它不仅适应了一般人在生活和工作上对体格、体力、体能的需要并对其缺欠和畸形状态加以补足和矫正，而且简单易行。如果我们能够确切地按照关于这个体操的“动作说明”和“注意事项”经常地、认真地进行练习，我们的健康状况必将日益改善。
