　　Han Xingguo and Others from the State-Owned Wenzhou Joint Transportation Company Punished for Embezzling State Property
    Editor: The Discipline Inspection Committee of the Wenzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Finance and Economics Committee of the Wenzhou Municipal People's Government have investigated and verified the facts of embezzlement and waste by Han Xingguo, Deputy Manager of the State-Owned Wenzhou Joint Transportation Company and a Communist Party member, and Mei Chongshan, Deputy Chief of the Business Section and a Communist Party member. Administratively, Han Xingguo and others have been given the punishment of dismissal from their posts, and the Party has also decided to give them appropriate punishment. Han Xingguo embezzled a total of 6.6 million yuan in five separate incidents during his year or so working at the State-Owned Wenzhou Joint Transportation Company. He also shielded Jiang Guoping, the head of the business section, who embezzled 17 million yuan of public funds, and wasted state property in business dealings. Mei Chongshan embezzled 1.08 million yuan and wasted 630,000 yuan on business trips and other expenses. This shows that Han and Mei still possess the consciousness of the exploiting classes. I believe that Party organizations in various places should particularly strengthen Party education to thoroughly overcome the exploiting class consciousness of certain Party members.

　　国营温州联运公司韩兴国等贪污国家财产受到处分
    编辑同志：中共温州市委纪律检查委员会及温州市人民政府财政经济委员会检查出国营温州联运公司副经理、共产党员韩兴国、业务股副股长、共产党员梅崇山贪污浪费的事实。现行政上已给予韩兴国等以撤销职务的处分，党亦决定给以适当的处分。韩兴国在国营温州联运公司工作一年多，先后贪污五次，计六十六万元。并包庇业务科长江果苹贪污公款一千七百万元，以及在业务上浪费国家财产。梅崇山先后贪污一百零八万元，出差等浪费六十三万元。这说明了韩、梅二人还存在着剥削阶级的意识。我认为各地党组织应特别加强党的教育，以彻底克服某些党员的剥削阶级意识。
