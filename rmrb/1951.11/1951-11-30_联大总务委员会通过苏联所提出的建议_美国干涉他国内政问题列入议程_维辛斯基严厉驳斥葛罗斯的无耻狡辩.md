Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 28th – TASS reports: The General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly convened on the 27th to discuss and pass the Soviet proposal to include the issue of US interference in the internal affairs of other countries on the agenda of the General Assembly.

On the 22nd, the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, wrote to the President of the United Nations General Assembly, Naff, suggesting that the following important and urgent issue be included on the agenda of the current General Assembly: "Aggressive actions of the United States of America and interference in the internal affairs of other countries – manifested as the appropriation of one hundred million US dollars as funds to recruit personnel in and outside the territories of the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, and certain other democratic countries, and to organize armed groups." In the memorandum, Vyshinsky pointed out that the "Mutual Security Act of 1951," signed by US President Truman on October 10, stipulated the above-mentioned unprecedented actions of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.

During the General Committee's discussion of the Soviet proposal, US representative Gross clumsily attempted to portray the issue as legislation rather than action, and therefore not within the purview of the United Nations organization. However, this ridiculous argument could not conceal the new aggressive actions of the United States, a fact of which even the US delegation was keenly aware. Therefore, Gross had to state in his speech that he did not object to including the issue on the agenda.

Polish representative Lachs pointed out in his speech that this unscrupulous interference by the United States in the internal affairs of other countries completely violated the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter, and such interference was akin to aggression.

Subsequently, Vyshinsky spoke, refuting Gross's unfounded claims, stating that everyone knows that laws are the basis for actions. He cited irrefutable facts to prove that there were ample reasons to accuse the United States of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.

The General Committee then unanimously decided to recommend that the General Assembly include the issue raised by the Soviet Union on the agenda of the Sixth General Assembly.

    联大总务委员会通过苏联所提出的建议
    美国干涉他国内政问题列入议程
    维辛斯基严厉驳斥葛罗斯的无耻狡辩
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社巴黎二十八日讯：联合国大会总务委员会二十七日开会讨论并通过了苏联提出的把关于美国干涉他国内政问题列入大会议程的建议。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基曾在二十二日写信给联合国大会主席纳孚，建议把下述重要而迫切的问题列入本届大会议程：“美利坚合众国的侵略行动及对其他国家内政的干涉，——表现为拨款一亿美元作为经费，在苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚和其他的某些民主国家及这些国家领土之外招募人员，并组织武装集团。”维辛斯基在备忘录中指出，美国总统杜鲁门十月十日所签署的“一九五一年共同安全法”规定了上述的史无前例的干涉他国内政的行动。
    在总务委员会讨论苏联建议的时候，美国代表葛罗斯非常笨拙地企图把这个问题说成是立法而不是行动，因此这个问题就不在联合国组织的权限以内。但是这种可笑的论据丝毫也不能掩饰美国的这种新的侵略行动，对于这一点甚至美国代表团也颇有自知之明。因此，葛罗斯在发言中不得不声明他并不反对把这个问题列入议程。
    波兰代表拉奇斯在发言中指出，美国这种对其他国家内政的肆无忌惮的干涉，完全违反了联合国宪章的基本原则，这种干涉就和侵略一样。
    接着，维辛斯基发言，他驳斥了葛罗斯的毫无根据的说法，他说，任何人都知道，法律是行动的根据。他列举出了无可辩驳的事实，证明完全有理由控诉美国干涉其他国家内政。
    总务委员会随即一致决议，建议大会把苏联提出的这个问题列入六届大会的议程。
