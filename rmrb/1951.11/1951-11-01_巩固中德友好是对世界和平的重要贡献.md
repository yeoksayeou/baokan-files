    Consolidating Sino-German Friendship is an Important Contribution to World Peace
    By Dí tè, Head of the People's Delegation from the German Democratic Republic
    Editor's Note: Dí tè, Head of the People's Delegation from the German Democratic Republic, representative of the Free German Trade Union Federation, and Chairman of the Free German Trade Union in Greater Berlin, who was invited to attend our National Day celebrations, gave a speech on the Central People's Broadcasting Station before leaving Beijing for East China on October 10th for a tour. The station broadcast a recording of his speech on October 26th. The following is a translation of his speech.
    Dear friends:
    First, please allow me to state that I am entrusted by millions of members of democratic people's organizations and all peace-loving German people in the German Democratic Republic to convey the most sincere and friendly respects to the heroic and victorious Chinese people, the Chinese government, and Chairman Mao Zedong, and to wish you even greater achievements.
    Our delegation accepted the invitation of Chinese democratic people's organizations and came here, receiving a warm welcome and hospitality, for which we are deeply grateful. We have been in China for more than two weeks. Thanks to the excellent organization and arrangements of our Chinese comrades, we have seen many things and visited the lives of residents.
    The Chinese government and people's organizations have very enthusiastically and frankly told us about the growth of the People's Republic, its work, and its goals. We have had many opportunities to talk with workers, farmers, women, youth, scientists, students, artists, and writers. In addition, we have learned about the many heroic deeds of the People's Liberation Army led by the glorious Communist Party and its beloved leader Mao Zedong, as well as the tremendous changes of the past two years.
    Another unforgettable experience was the reception given by the Central People's Government on the eve of October 1st. At that time, we saw Chairman Mao Zedong and were able to personally offer him our congratulations.
    The military parade and the grand march of the working people on National Day gave us a deep impression. This demonstrated the Chinese people's fervent desire for peace. At the same time, we also realized the Chinese people's unanimous determination to resist American imperialist aggression with all their strength and to vigorously support Korea. Yes, dear listeners, it is American imperialism that threatens world peace. The flames of war in Korea have already aroused hatred for the instigators of imperialist war throughout Europe and have strengthened the peace movement. Part of the peace camp led by the Soviet Union and the great Stalin: China in the East and Germany in the West, are about to become the focus of struggle according to the plans of American imperialism. In Korea, American imperialism has already launched a brutal war. Japan is to be rearmed and turned into an American mercenary army.
    In our homeland, West Germany, preparations are being made for a new war, a new Korean incident, through rearmament. This is being promoted by Anglo-American imperialism and carried out by the Adenauer regime, which is hated by the people. Both the German people and the Chinese people unanimously do not need war. They hope to heal the wounds left by the last war and are willing to build peacefully, making the motherland and the future better and brighter.
    Therefore, we German people especially feel the need to unite with the Chinese people. Our common enemy, American imperialism, is threatening us, so consolidating Sino-German friendship is an important contribution to defending world peace. Strive for peace in Asia, strive for peace in Europe, strive for world peace!
    Since liberation, the Chinese people have embarked on a path leading to a new and better life. They need peace to achieve even more fruits. Two years is not a long time for a nation. However, in such a short time, China has made many achievements. The residents of Xiaohongmen in the suburbs of Beijing told us how land reform aroused great joy among the peasants and how rural life has changed. The peasants spoke of their government and Chairman Mao Zedong with great love and respect. Every word of Comrade Peng Zhen, the Mayor of Beijing, in his speech to us on land reform, was confirmed by the peasants themselves. The same is true of the implementation of the Trade Union Law under the leadership of Comrade Li Lisan, Vice Chairman of the Trade Union.
    Workers in enterprises have indeed gained the right to participate in management, thus opening the way for social and cultural upsurge. This has never happened in Chinese history. I am an old trade union worker who understands the German and international trade union movement, and I must admit that I was deeply moved by the new status that workers, especially railway, hardware, textile, and electrical workers, have gained in the people's enterprises today.
    This revolutionary and patriotic enthusiasm is manifested in many facts: the movement of model workers and labor heroes; the completion of individual and collective patriotic covenants; the use of rationalization proposals and the working methods and experiences of socialist Soviet workers; the actions to aid Korea, etc. This enthusiasm guarantees that the working class in alliance with the peasants can achieve leapfrog progress. More importantly, it is because there are such battle-tested leaders, under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, working in responsible democratic people's organizations.
    We Germans are proud and happy to be friends of the People's Republic of China. We, the German People's Delegation, have seen a lot in China, but have learned even more. When we return home, we will report to the German people about China's construction, the Chinese people's desire for peace, and the heroic battles of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea, who have defended China and also defended world peace.
    Every progress and every achievement that China has made is a blow to American imperialism. Therefore, this is beneficial to the German people and beneficial to the world peace camp.
    Dear friends and listeners, the same thoughts and courage unite us. We will be like this forever. Our happiness is built on the foundation of peace. Let me end my speech with the most sincere wishes to the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and Chairman Mao Zedong—our friends. Long live the eternal friendship between China and Germany!

### 巩固中德友好是对世界和平的重要贡献

    巩固中德友好是对世界和平的重要贡献
    德意志民主共和国人民观礼代表团团长  狄特
    编者按：应邀参加我国国庆节的德意志民主共和国人民观礼代表团团长、自由德国工会联合会代表、大柏林市自由德国工会主席狄特，于十月十日离北京赴华东各地参观访问之前，应邀在中央人民广播电台演说。该台于十月二十六日播送了他演说的录音，下面是他的演说词的译文。亲爱的朋友们：
    首先请允许我说明：我受了德意志民主共和国民主人民团体的几百万会员和全体爱好和平的德国人民的委托，将最诚恳友好的敬意转达给英勇的、胜利的中国人民、中国政府和毛泽东主席，并祝你们获得更多的成果。
    我们代表团接受中国民主人民团体的邀请来到此地，受了热情的欢迎和招待，我们深深地感激。我们已经在中国逗留了两个多星期。感谢中国同志的很好的组织安排，我们看到了很多事物，并且参观了一次居民的生活。
    中国政府和各人民团体很热心而且坦白地把人民共和国的成长经过、她的工作和目标讲给我们听。我们曾经有很多机会和工人、农民、妇女、青年、科学家、学生、艺术家和作家们谈话。此外，我们还学习了光荣的共产党及其亲爱的领袖毛泽东所领导的人民解放军的许多英雄战斗事迹，以及近两年来的巨大的变革。
    还有一段使人难以忘怀的经历，那就是十月一日前一天晚上中央人民政府所设的招待会。当时我们看见了毛泽东主席，并且能够亲身把我们的祝贺献给他。
    国庆节的阅兵典礼和劳动人民的盛大游行给予我们一个深刻的印象。这表现了中国人民的热烈的和平愿望。同时我们也体会到中国人民以全力反抗美帝国主义侵略和大力支援朝鲜的一致的战斗决心。是的，亲爱的听众们，威胁了全世界和平的就是美国帝国主义。朝鲜的战火，已经在全欧洲引起了对帝国主义战争发动者的憎恨，并且使和平运动增强了。苏联和伟大斯大林领导的和平阵营的一部分：东方的中国和西方的德国，按照美帝国主义的计划即将成为斗争的焦点。在朝鲜，美国帝国主义则已经发动了残酷的战争。日本将要被重新武装而变成美国的雇佣军队。
    在我们的家乡西德那边，正以重整军备的方式来筹备一次新的战争，就是新的朝鲜事件。这是由英美帝国主义所推动，而由人民所仇恨的阿登纳政权来执行的。德国人民和中国人民都一致不需要战争。他们希望医好上次战争留下的创伤，愿意和平建设，使祖国和未来变得更美好光明。
    所以我们德国人民特别感觉要和中国人民团结。我们的共同敌人美帝国主义正在威胁我们，因此巩固中德友好，也就是对于保卫世界和平的一项重要的贡献。争取亚洲的和平，争取欧洲的和平，争取世界的和平！
    解放以后，中国人民已经走上了导向新的和美好的生活的道路。他们需要和平以获得更多的果实。两年的时间对于一个民族来说是不长的。可是，在这样短的时间里面，中国却做出了很多成绩。北京郊区小红门的居民告诉我们：土地改革如何在农民中间引起巨大的欢欣鼓舞，农村生活起了怎样的变化。农民们以非常的热爱和尊敬来谈论他们的政府和毛泽东主席。北京市长彭真同志对我们作的关于土地改革的讲话的每一个字，都为农民们自己所证实。在工会副主席李立三同志领导下，工会法的实施情况也是同样的。
    企业中的工人确实已经获得了参与管理的权利，因此就给社会和文化的高涨打开了道路。这是中国历史上从来不曾有过的。我是一个了解德国和国际工会运动的老工会工作者，我应该承认：工人们，特别是铁路、五金、纺织和电气工人能在人民所有的企业中获得今天的新的地位，使我受了深深的感动。
    这种革命的和爱国的热情是在下述的许多事实中表现出来了：劳动模范和劳动英雄的运动；个人和集体爱国公约的完成；合理化建议和社会主义苏联工人的工作法和经验的使用；援助朝鲜的行动等。这种热情保证了和农民联盟的工人阶级能得到飞跃的进步。更重要的，还是因为有如此久经战斗考验的领袖们，在光荣的共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，在负责民主人民团体的工作。
    我们德国人能够成为中华人民共和国的朋友感到骄傲和愉快。我们德国人民代表团在中国看到了很多东西，但是学习到了更多的东西。等我们回到家乡以后，我们将把中国的建设，中国人民的和平愿望，保卫了中国也保卫了世界和平的中国人民志愿军在朝鲜的英勇战斗，报告给德国人民听。
    中国得到的每一点进步，每一项成果，都是对美帝国主义的一个打击。所以这就对德国人民有利，也对世界和平阵营有利。
    亲爱的朋友和听众们，相同的思想和勇气把我们团结在一起。我们将永久这样。我们的幸福是建筑在和平的基础上。让我以向中国人民、中国政府和毛泽东主席——我们的友人——致最诚恳的祝福来结束我的讲话吧。中德永久友好万岁！
