　　【Our Newspaper's Dispatch】On the afternoon of November 15th, at 2:00 PM, over one thousand agricultural labor model representatives from Liaoxi and Rehe provinces, and the Lüda city, who were visiting the Northeast Materials Exchange Exhibition in Shenyang, gathered together. Chairman Gao Gang of the Northeast People's Government attended and delivered a speech. Chairman Gao Gang briefly elaborated on the tremendous achievements in economics and politics made by the laboring people of Northeast China in recent years under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, through everyone's hard work. He encouraged the agricultural labor models present to continue their efforts alongside the local farmers and strive for even greater achievements. He requested the agricultural labor models present to not only be models in improving agricultural production, but also to become active members in consolidating the people's regime and breaking down superstition.
　　In his speech, Chairman Gao Gang, addressing the situation in areas that were liberated later and where the masses had not been fully mobilized, requested the labor models residing in those areas to actively participate in mobilizing the masses, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and reforming village administrations, in order to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and protect the land and happy lives of the laboring people. He also pointed out that feudal superstitions still exist to varying degrees in the countryside, and counter-revolutionaries often use the masses' superstitious ideas to spread rumors, sabotage, and harm the people. After analyzing the necessity of breaking down superstition, he requested that everyone, after returning to the countryside, widely and regularly promote the principles of breaking down superstition to the masses of farmers, raising their awareness and not giving counter-revolutionaries a chance to exploit loopholes. Finally, he called on all the agricultural labor models present to work hard to develop agricultural production, carefully select good seeds, accumulate and apply more manure and fertilizer, learn methods to increase yields, improve technology, and strive to increase the yield of each mu by five sheng of grain and each mu of cotton field by five jin of cotton in 1952. They should raise more livestock and grow more vegetables. At the same time, they should further improve labor organization, try to establish agricultural production cooperatives, rationally use labor, and improve production efficiency, so as to strengthen national defense, improve farmers' lives, and strive for a gradual transition to agricultural collectivization and a socialist society.
　　Chairman Gao Gang's call received enthusiastic support from all the labor models present. Everyone firmly expressed their determination to strive to realize Chairman Gao Gang's call. Guo Shuzhen, a female agricultural labor model from Liaoxi Province, said, "We fully support Chairman Gao Gang's call. After we return, we will definitely unite with the local farmers, resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and, with the help of our elder brother workers, improve farming methods, increase agricultural production, supply industrial production, and build our country into a more prosperous and beautiful one!"

    在沈阳参观物资交流展览会的东北农业劳动模范集会
    高岗主席号召努力爱国增产
    争取明年每亩地多产五升粮或五斤棉花
  【本报讯】十一月十五日下午二时，来沈阳参观东北物资交流展览大会的辽西、热河两省和旅大市的农业劳动模范代表一千余人集会，东北人民政府高岗主席出席讲话。高岗主席简要地阐述了几年来东北劳动人民在共产党和人民政府领导下，经过大家的辛勤劳动，在经济上和政治上所获得的巨大成就，勖勉与会的农业劳动模范们，要和当地全体农民继续努力前进，争取更大的成绩。他要求与会的农业劳动模范们，不仅要在提高农业生产上当模范，也要成为巩固人民政权、破除迷信等工作中的积极分子。
    高岗主席在讲话中，针对解放较晚、群众发动得还不充分的地区的情况，要求居住在那些地区的劳动模范们，积极参加发动群众、镇压反革命分子、改造村政权的工作，以便巩固人民民主专政，保护劳动人民的土地和幸福生活。他同时指出：在农村中，还存在着不同程度的封建迷信思想，反革命分子往往利用群众的迷信思想进行造谣、破坏、使人民遭到损害。他在分析了破除迷信的必要性之后，要求大家回到农村之后，把破除迷信的道理广泛地、经常地向农民群众进行宣传，提高群众觉悟，不给反革命分子有钻空子的机会。最后，他号召与会的全体农业劳动模范们，要努力发展农业生产，要精选优良种子，多积粪施肥，学习增加产量的办法，提高技术，争取一九五二年每亩地多打五升粮；每亩棉田多产五斤棉花。要多养牲畜、多种菜。同时，要进一步改进劳动组织，试办农业生产合作社，合理使用劳动力，提高生产效率，以增强国防力量，改善农民生活，为逐步走向农业集体化与社会主义社会而奋斗。
    高岗主席的号召，获得了与会全体劳动模范的热烈拥护。大家坚决表示了为实现高岗主席的号召而奋斗的决心。辽西省妇女农业劳动模范郭淑贞说：“我们完全拥护高岗主席的号召，我们回去之后，一定和当地农民团结一致，坚决镇压反革命分子，巩固人民民主专政，并在工人老大哥的帮助下，改进耕作方法，提高农业生产量，供应工业生产，把我们的国家建设得更加富强，更加美好！”
