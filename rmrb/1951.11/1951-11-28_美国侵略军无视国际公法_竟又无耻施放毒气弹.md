Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, November 27th: The despicable and shameless American aggressor troops have once again used poison gas on the front lines. At 2:30 PM on the 17th, the American aggressor troops shelled position 472.4 northwest of Kimhwa, held by our troops on the forward lines. They first launched two smoke bombs, then continuously fired seventeen shells, and finally shamelessly launched two poison gas bombs. After the poison gas bombs exploded, there was thick yellow smoke. Those poisoned experienced stomach pain, vomiting, and dizziness. The commanders and combatants of the Korean and Chinese People's Army are extremely indignant at the shameless actions of the American aggressor troops in disregarding international law and repeatedly using poison gas, and vow to strike the invading enemy with even more heroic fighting.

    美国侵略军无视国际公法
    竟又无耻施放毒气弹
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十七日电】卑鄙无耻的美国侵略军又在前线施放毒气弹。十七日下午二时半，美国侵略军炮击金化西北我军前沿阵地四七二点四高地，首先发射烟幕弹两枚，以后连续发射炮弹十七枚，最后竟发射毒气弹两枚。该毒气弹爆炸后，有黄色浓烟。中毒者发生肚痛、呕吐和头晕。朝中人民军队指挥员、战斗员对美国侵略军无视国际公法、屡次施放毒气弹的无耻行为，极为愤激，并誓以更英勇的战斗打击进犯的敌军。
