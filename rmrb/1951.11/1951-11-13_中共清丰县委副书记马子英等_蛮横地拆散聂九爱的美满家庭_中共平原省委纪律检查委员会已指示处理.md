The CCP Qingfeng County Deputy Secretary Ma Ziying and Others
　　Rudely Break Up Nie Jiu'ai's Happy Family
　　CCP Pingyuan Provincial Committee for Discipline Inspection Has Instructed Handling
　　CCP Qingfeng County Committee Deputy Secretary Ma Ziying and others harbor strong feudal ideas and rudely broke up a freely married couple.
　　The female in this couple is Nie Jiu'ai, from Baolu Village, Fifth District, Qingfeng County; the male, Yue Xitang, is from Hansibin (one li from Baolu Village), a Communist Party member, a disabled revolutionary soldier, and works at the Anyang Industrial Company's match factory. Nie Jiu'ai has known Yue Xitang since childhood. At that time, Yue Xitang was the head of the children's corps in Hansibin, and Nie Jiu'ai was a member of the sisters' corps. They often met together, and since Yue Xitang's sister was married in Baolu Village, they had more opportunities to be close and developed feelings. Later, Yue Xitang and Nie Jiu'ai were formally introduced by Yue Qiaozhen and Zhang Ximei of Baolu Village, and Nie Jiu'ai also invited her fourth sister, Jiu Yun, to be the wedding officiant. They were married on June 15th of last year.
　　Although Nie Jiu'ai's father, Nie Meitang, is a Communist Party member, he retains feudal ideas. When he learned that his daughter Jiu'ai had freely married Yue Xitang, he was very angry and falsely accused Yue Xitang of abducting his daughter to the Fifth District People's Government. Deputy District Chief Ma Huaijing summoned Nie Jiu'ai, Yue Xitang, and the two matchmakers to the district for questioning. On the spot, Nie Jiu'ai and Yue Xitang stated that the marriage was voluntary on both sides, explained that they had found the matchmakers themselves, and requested the government's approval. Ma Huaijing was unable to make a decision at the time and consulted with Huang Chaoqun, Deputy Secretary of the CCP District Committee of the district. Huang Chaoqun believed that Nie Jiu'ai and Yue Xitang's free marriage was in line with the spirit of the Marriage Law and suggested that the District People's Government should approve their marriage and provide legal protection. Ma Huaijing accepted this suggestion, but he also felt that such a free marriage had a "bad influence on the masses." In order to restore the so-called "influence" among the masses, he detained the two matchmakers for three days without any reason. He also gave Nie Meitang some education.
　　Nie Meitang was extremely dissatisfied with this handling and tried to frame Yue Qiaozhen, one of the matchmakers. Nie Meitang first wooed Zhang Ximei, even kowtowing to Zhang Ximei, asking Zhang Ximei not to admit that she was the matchmaker for Nie Jiu'ai's marriage, and falsely accused Yue Qiaozhen of being an abductor who had profited from two shi of wheat. Zhang Ximei immediately objected, saying, "I will say what I have to say. I can't turn black into white. I can't betray my conscience." Nie Meitang insisted on destroying his daughter's happy marriage, saying, "If I can't win the case in the district, I'll sue to the county. If I still can't win, I'll sue to the provincial government."
　　Nie Meitang had a nephew named Nie Fengde, who was a public security assistant员 in the district government and also a Communist Party member. He was also dissatisfied with Ma Huaijing's handling, so he helped Nie Meitang go to CCP Qingfeng County Deputy Secretary Ma Ziying to "complain." After listening to Nie Fengde's "complaint," Ma Ziying not only did not stand on the Party's position and criticize Nie Fengde's and others' erroneous ideas, but instead supported Nie Fengde and Nie Meitang's erroneous behavior and discussed with the Qingfeng County People's Government and the People's Court about punishing Yue Xitang. Therefore, he sent Liu Jingzhao, an officer from the CCP Qingfeng County Committee for Discipline Inspection, to Baolu Village to investigate. Liu Jingzhao only listened to the opinions of a few village cadres and some backward masses in Baolu Village, and then returned to report, saying, "Nie Jiu'ai and Yue Xitang's marriage was not a free marriage. They left in the middle of the night. It was 'abduction'. The matchmaker profited from it, using a piece of cloth, which is a sale of marriage." Ma Ziying and Li Yugong, Director of the Qingfeng County People's Government Supervisory Committee and a Communist Party member, and Nie Shaomin, Secretary of the CCP Qingfeng County Committee for Discipline Inspection, then believed this false report and mistakenly concluded that Nie Jiu'ai and Yue Xitang's marriage was a marriage of sale. On August 4th of last year, the Qingfeng County People's Court tried this case, with Wang Fujun (Communist Party member) as the judge. Nie Jiu'ai and Yue Xitang fought against the county People's Court's illegal actions of infringing on freedom of marriage. The following is the Q&A at the time:
　　Judge Wang asked: What procedures did you go through for your marriage? Did you pull a cart? Did you carry a sedan chair? How many people accompanied you?
　　Yue replied: The new society opposes pulling carts and carrying sedan chairs. I didn't pull a cart, and I didn't carry a sedan chair. She was willing to go herself.
　　Judge Wang asked: She was willing to go to you?
　　Yue replied: Can't you ask her?
　　Judge Wang asked (to Nie): How did Yue Xitang abduct you?
　　Nie replied: I am not a two- or three-year-old child who can be easily abducted. I found the matchmaker myself. I am willing to marry Yue Xitang.
　　Judge Wang asked: Why didn't you tell your parents when you got married?
　　Nie replied: He is stubborn. He sold my sister. I don't want to be bullied anymore. Is it not okay to have my sister as the wedding officiant!
　　This Wang Fujun, who was full of feudal ideas, seeing that he could not get the confession he needed, illegally wrote a divorce certificate and asked Yue Xitang and Nie Jiu'ai to put their fingerprints on it. At that time, Yue Xitang knew it was a divorce certificate, and he wanted to use it as evidence to appeal to the higher-level government to sue Wang Fujun, so he put his fingerprint on it. Nie Jiu'ai mistakenly thought it was a marriage certificate, so she also put her fingerprint on it. When Jiu'ai knew it was a divorce certificate, she immediately expressed her firm opposition to Wang Fujun's illegal behavior. She said, "You are a government cadre, don't you know freedom of marriage? I have learned about the Marriage Law in school. Freedom of marriage is not allowed to be interfered with by a third party. You don't allow us to marry, you are breaking the law!" This case was questioned in the county People's Court for three days, but Wang Fujun never got the confession he needed. Nie Jiu'ai always said, "Freedom of marriage, no one can make decisions for me. Even if my father disagrees, I will break away from him and never go back to his home."
　　Seeing that his daughter's will was firm, Nie Meitang designed to lure Jiu'ai. He said to Jiu'ai, "Come home once and then leave!" Nie Jiu'ai initially refused to return, but Wang Fujun helped Nie Meitang deceive Nie Jiu'ai, saying, "As long as you go home, I will send the marriage certificate the next day." This is how Nie Jiu'ai was deceived into returning home. On the way home, Nie Meitang and Nie Fengde threatened Nie Jiu'ai, saying, "In the county, you can do whatever you want, but here, I am in charge. When you get home, I will break your legs!" "If you are not honest, I will kill you. Even if I kill you, I still have four daughters!" Nie Meitang tried to hit Nie Jiu'ai several times, but the militiamen stopped him. After arriving home, that night, Nie Fengde and the village militiamen, carrying guns, sent Nie Jiu'ai to her sister's house in Xiyangshao.
　　After Yue Xitang learned about Nie Jiu'ai's return home, he ran to the Qingfeng County People's Court the next day to ask Wang Fujun for her. Wang Fujun said, "I didn't ask for her from you. I asked for her from the matchmaker. Why are you so concerned? I am more concerned than you!" Yue Xitang insisted on appealing, and Wang Fujun had no way to deal with it, so he had to agree to retry the case in Baolu Village. At this time, due to Nie Meitang's various threats, Nie Jiu'ai was no longer dare to resist. Therefore, during the trial, Nie Jiu'ai was forced to say what her father had taught her: "I don't want to marry Yue Xitang anymore!" Wang Fujun then made a ruling, denying the legal marriage relationship between Nie Jiu'ai and Yue Xitang.
　　After that, Nie Meitang, seeing that his feudal ideas had been supported by Ma Ziying, Wang Fujun, and others, became even more rude to Nie Jiu'ai and forcibly married Nie Jiu'ai off twice. The first time, he married Jiu'ai to a Liu family in Tianjiao Village, Fifth District, Weixian County, Hebei Province. The Qingfeng County People's Court also issued a marriage certificate. After the marriage, Nie Jiu'ai could not bear the abuse and asked the local government for a divorce, which was approved. The second time, Nie Meitang forcibly married Nie Jiu'ai to Shen Zifang of Xingwang Village in the district. Nie Meitang also said to Shen Zifang, "Even if you beat her to death, I won't care." Since then, Nie Jiu'ai has fallen into a life of hardship.
　　The CCP Qingfeng County Committee discovered this incident during the Party rectification at the beginning of this year, but its understanding of it was insufficient. Moreover, because Ma Ziying, Li Keshu (Ma Ziying's wife), Chairman of the Qingfeng County Democratic Women's Federation and a Communist Party member, and Nie Shaomin and others insisted on the mistake, believing that "Nie Jiu'ai and Yue Xitang's marriage was not a free marriage, but 'abduction', a 'sale of marriage'; the family is not satisfied, and the masses do not agree, so it does not comply with the Marriage Law." At the same time, the County Committee Secretary Cao Shijing reported this incident to the CCP Puyang Prefectural Committee, but it did not attract the attention of the Puyang Prefectural Committee. Therefore, this case has been shelved until now.
　　On October 27, 1951, the Pingyuan Daily announced this case. On October 28th, the CCP Pingyuan Provincial Committee for Discipline Inspection instructed the CCP Puyang Prefectural Committee for Discipline Inspection to immediately instruct these party member cadres who interfered with Nie Jiu'ai's marriage to conduct profound self-criticism and reflection. Those who should be punished must be given the disciplinary action they deserve and announced in the newspaper. The Pingyuan Provincial Democratic Women's Federation instructed the main responsible comrades of the Qingfeng County Democratic Women's Federation and the Puyang Special District Democratic Women's Federation to, together with the Qingfeng County People's Government, earnestly and responsibly help Nie Jiu'ai to get rid of her suffering, so that Nie Jiu'ai's marriage can truly be free.

　　中共清丰县委副书记马子英等
    蛮横地拆散聂九爱的美满家庭
    中共平原省委纪律检查委员会已指示处理
    中共平原清丰县县委副书记马子英等存在着浓厚的封建思想，蛮横地拆散了一对自由结婚的夫妇。
    这对夫妇的女方是聂九爱，清丰县五区报禄村人；男方岳喜堂是寒泗滨（距报禄村一里地）人，共产党员，革命残废军人，在安阳实业公司火柴厂作工。聂九爱从小就和岳喜堂认识。那时岳喜堂是寒泗滨的儿童团长，聂九爱是姊妹团团员，他俩常在一块开会，加上岳喜堂的姐姐又嫁在报禄村，因此两人接近的机会更多，就有了感情。后来，岳喜堂和聂九爱经过报禄村岳巧珍、张喜梅正式介绍，聂九爱又请了自己的四姐九云来当主婚人，去年六月十五日就结婚了。
    聂九爱的父亲聂梅堂虽然是个共产党员，但残存着封建思想。当他知道女儿九爱与岳喜堂自由结婚时，非常生气，便向五区人民政府诬告岳喜堂拐走自己的女儿。副区长马怀警就把轰九爱、岳喜堂和两个介绍人传到区里审问。当场聂九爱、岳喜堂表示：结婚是双方自愿，并说明介绍人是自己找的，要求政府批准。马怀警一时无法作决定，就和该区中共区委副书记黄超群商量。黄超群认为聂九爱与岳喜堂是自由结婚，符合婚姻法的精神，建议区人民政府应批准他们的结婚，给以法律保护。马怀警接受了这个建议，但他又觉得这样的自由结婚，“在群众中的影响不好”，为了挽回在群众中的所谓“影响”，就把两个介绍人毫无道理地扣押了三天。对聂梅堂也进行了一些教育。
    聂梅堂对此处理，极为不满，即设法陷害婚事介绍人之一的岳巧珍。聂梅堂首先拉拢张喜梅，甚至给张喜梅叩头，要求张喜梅不要承认是聂九爱婚事的介绍人，并诬蔑岳巧珍是拐子，从中得了两石麦子。张喜梅当即反对说：“我有啥说啥，是黑我不能说成白，我不能亏良心。”聂梅堂却执意要破坏女儿的美满婚姻，便说：“区里告不赢告到县，再不赢我告到省政府。”
    聂梅堂有个侄子叫聂逢德，是区政府公安助理员，也是共产党员。他也不满意马怀警的处理办法，因此便帮助聂梅堂，到中共清破县委副书记马子英那里去“诉苦”。马子英听了轰逢德的“诉苦”后，不但没有站在党的立场，对聂逢德等错误思想进行批判，反而支持聂逢德、聂梅堂的错误行为，与清丰县人民政府、人民法院商量着要惩办岳喜堂。于是派中共清丰县委纪律检查委员会干事刘景兆到报禄村去调查。刘景兆到报禄村仅听取了少数村干部和部分落后群众的意见，就回来汇报说：“聂九爱与岳喜堂不是自由结婚，是半夜走的，是‘拐带’。媒人从中取利，使了一个布，是买卖婚姻。”马子英和清丰县人民政府监察委员会主任、共产党员李玉功，中共清丰县委纪律检查委员会秘书聂绍民便听信了这篇假报告，错误地作出这样的结论：聂九爱和岳喜堂的结婚是买卖婚姻。去年八月四日，清丰县人民法院审判这一案子，由审判员王福均（共产党员）审问。聂九爱、岳喜堂当场对县人民法院侵犯婚姻自由的违法行为进行了斗争。以下是当时的问答：
    王问：你结婚通过什么手续？拉车了吗？抬轿了吗？跟几个送亲的？
    岳答：新社会反对拉车、抬轿。俺也没拉车，也没抬轿，是她自己愿意去的。
    王问：她自己愿意上你那去？
    岳答：你不能问问她吗？
    王问：（向聂）你怎么叫岳喜堂拐走的？
    聂答：我不是两三岁的小孩，就能随便叫人家拐走啦，我自己找的介绍人，我情愿和岳喜堂结婚。
    王问：你结婚为啥不跟你大人说一声呢？
    聂答：他顽固，把俺姐姐卖啦，我不愿意再受气。找俺姐姐当的主婚人还不行！
    这个满脑子封建思想的王福均，见问不出他所需要的口供，竟违法乱纪地写了一个离婚证书，要岳喜堂、聂九爱按手印。当时岳喜堂知道是离婚证书，他想以此为证向上级政府控告王福均，便按上了自己的手印；聂九爱误以为是结婚证书，也就按上了手印。当九爱知道是离婚证书时，当场就表示坚决反对王福均的非法行为，她说：“你是政府干部，结婚自由你不知道吗？俺在学校里都学过婚姻法，结婚自由不准第三人干涉，你不准俺结婚，你犯法！”这个案件在该县人民法院一直问了三天，总是得不到王福均需要的口供。聂九爱总是说：“婚姻自由，谁也当不了我的家，俺爹不同意，我和他脱离关系，永不回他家去。”
    聂梅堂见女儿意志坚定，便设计诱骗九爱。对九爱说：“回家一次再走！”聂九爱起初不回，王福均就帮助聂梅堂欺骗聂九爱说：“只要你回家，第二天就送结婚证。”这样才把聂九爱骗回家去。在回家的路上，聂梅堂、聂逢德威胁聂九爱说：“在县里由你，在这里由我，到家里，出门砸断你的腿！”“再不老老实实，就打死你，打死你我还有四个闺女哩！”聂梅堂几次要打聂九爱，被民兵拦住。到家后，当天晚上，聂逢德和该村民兵带着枪，把聂九爱送到西杨邵她姐姐家去了。
    岳喜堂知道聂九爱回家的情形后，第二天，就跑到清丰县人民法院向王福均要人。王福均却说：“我没从你手要人，我是从介绍人手里要的，你关那心干啥，俺比你还关心哩！”岳喜堂坚决要上告，王福均无法对付，只得答应到报禄村重新审判。这时，由于聂梅堂的种种威吓，聂九爱已经不敢反抗。因此在审判时，聂九爱被迫按照她父亲教给的话说：“我不愿和岳喜堂结婚啦！”王福均随即定案，否定了聂九爱与岳喜堂的合法婚姻关系。
    此后，聂梅堂因见自己的封建思想，得到了马子英、王福均等人的支持，对聂九爱更加蛮横，两次强制聂九爱出嫁。第一次把九爱嫁给河北省魏县五区田教村姓刘的。清丰县人民法院还特别发给了结婚证。结婚后，聂九爱不堪虐待，到当地区政府要求离婚，被批准了。第二次聂梅堂又强制聂九爱与本区兴旺庄申自芳结婚，聂梅堂并对申自芳说：“你打死她，俺也不管。”从此以后，聂九爱落到了苦难的日子里。
    中共清丰县委在今年初整党中发现了这一事件，但对此认识不足；又因马子英、清丰县民主妇联主席、共产党员李可淑（马子英的爱人）、聂绍民等坚持错误，认为：“聂九爱与岳喜堂不是自由结婚，是‘拐带’，是‘买卖婚姻’；家庭不满意，群众不同意，这就不合婚姻法”；同时，该县县委书记曹士敬虽向中共濮阳地委反映了这一事件，但未引起濮阳地委重视；所以，此案也就一直搁到现在。
    一九五一年十月二十七日，平原日报公布了这个案子，十月二十八日中共平原省委纪律检查委员会，又指示中共濮阳地委纪律检查委员会，要他们立即指示这些干涉聂九爱婚姻的党员干部，深刻检讨反省，应受处分者，必须给以应得的纪律处分，并在报纸上公布。平原省民主妇女联合会指示清丰县民主妇联与濮阳专区民主妇联主要负责同志，应协同清丰县人民政府，认真负责帮助聂九爱解除痛苦，使聂九爱的婚姻，真正得到自由。（根据平原日报材料改编）
