Cultural Life Brief Comments

    Resolutely Oppose the Argument of Eliminating the Party's Tendency in Literature and Art

    The Party's literary and artistic work is an integral part of the Party's cause. It must have a high degree of political and class nature, that is, the Party's tendency, in order to become a powerful weapon for uniting and educating the people, and for attacking and eliminating the enemy. Because the Party not only represents the interests of the proletariat, but also represents the interests of the entire nation and all the people, affirming the Party spirit of literature and art also affirms the responsibility of literature and art to serve the people. In a society with classes and parties, it is unimaginable to have art for art's sake, art that is above classes and parties, or the existence of art that is parallel to or independent of politics. This is already common sense. However, in the "Pen Talk" of Fan Qixin in "Yunnan Literature and Art", "Kunming Federation of Literary and Art Circles Anniversary Special Issue", and "Me and the Federation of Literary and Art Circles," he said, "There should be no Party tendency in literature and art," which is obviously very wrong. As is well known, the main problem in current literary and artistic work is that the "Party tendency" is far from enough. This statement of eliminating the Party's tendency in literature and art is actually a rehash of the old tune of bourgeois literature and art being "above class" and "above politics," which has long been criticized. However, today such harmful words appear in "Yunnan Literature and Art" again, which cannot but show the vagueness of the political and artistic thought of the editors of this journal.

    Attention Should Be Paid to Correcting the Anti-Historical Tendency in Opera Reform

    A good people's opera worker must inherit our excellent national artistic heritage with a serious and correct attitude, and should carry out opera reform work with the scientific viewpoint of historical materialism and the principle of realism. Now, some old operas, which perform ancient people and ancient events, often intersperse some modern new terms in the plays, sing currently popular songs, or arrange modern things on the stage as scenery, making it impossible to distinguish between ancient and modern, which not only violates history but also distorts reality. This anti-historical tendency must be corrected. Some old operas performed by the Wenyi Theater of Jimo County, Shandong Province, have this phenomenon. For example, when the theater performed "Revenge of the Fisherman," when the teacher came on stage, he wore his hat crookedly, draped his robe askew, and hummed the song: "The sky in the liberated area is a bright sky..." which was nondescript. When performing "Yu Tang Chun," when Su San was escorted, the old man who watched over her said to Su San: "Child, you were born in the past. If you were born now, you could also join the revolution." When performing "The Cat for Crown Prince," a large red five-pointed star was hung on the curtain in the middle of the stage, and two paper-made airplanes were hung in the air above the stage. These phenomena of ancient people singing modern songs, speaking modern words, and old operas using things from modern life to decorate the scenery are not only found in some programs performed by the Wenyi Theater of Jimo County, Shandong Province, but also in operas performed in other places. It is hoped that opera workers can pay attention to this and correct it.

    文化生活简评
    坚决反对取消文艺上党的倾向性的论调
    党的文学艺术工作是党的事业中的一个组成部分，它必须具有高度的政治性、阶级性，也就是党的倾向性，才可能成为团结人民，教育人民，打击敌人消灭敌人的有力武器。因为党不但代表无产阶级的利益，而且代表全民族和全体人民的利益，肯定了文学艺术的党性也就肯定了文学艺术必须为人民服务的责任。在有阶级有党的社会里，不能想像为艺术而艺术，超阶级、超党性的艺术，不能想像有与政治并行或互相独立的艺术的存在。这已经是常识。但“云南文艺”“昆明文联周年纪念特辑”“我与文联”的“笔谈”里，范启新却说“不要存在着文艺上的党的倾向”，这显然是十分错误的。如众所知，目前文学艺术工作中的主要问题，是“党的倾向”十分不够。这种取消文艺上的党的倾向性的说法，实际上是资产阶级的文艺“超阶级”、“超政治”的老调重弹，这是早经批判过的了，但今天这种有害的言词又出现在“云南文艺”上，不能不说明该刊编辑政治思想与文艺思想的模糊。
    应注意纠正戏曲改革中的反历史主义倾向
    一个好的人民戏曲工作者，必须以严肃、正确的态度继承我们优秀的民族艺术遗产，并应以历史唯物主义的科学观点和现实主义的原则进行戏曲改革工作。现在有些旧戏，演的古人古事，但却常常在戏中穿插一些现代的新名词，唱现在流行的歌曲，或在舞台上布置现代的东西作为布景，弄得古今不分，既违反了历史，也歪曲了现实，这种反历史主义的倾向，必须注意纠正。山东即墨县文艺剧院演出的一些旧戏中，就有这种现象。如该剧院演“渔家仇”时，教师爷一出场，歪戴着帽子，斜披着袍，嘴里哼着：“解放区的天，是明朗的天……”的歌子，不伦不类；演“玉堂春”，苏三起解时，看差的老头对苏三说：“孩子，你这是生在过去，要是生在现在，也可以参加革命去了。”演“狸猫换太子”时，舞台中间的幕布上却挂着一个很大的红五角星，舞台上空挂着两个纸糊的大飞机。这些古人唱现代歌，说现代话，旧戏用现代生活中的事物装饰布景的现象，不只山东即墨县文艺剧院演出的一些节目中有，其他地方演出的戏曲中也有类似情形，希望戏曲工作者能够引起注意，以加纠正。
