    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 25th: According to TASS, Hai Ali, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Algerian Communist Party, published an article in "Pravda" on the 23rd, discussing the national liberation movement of the people of North Africa.

    Hai Ali first pointed out that the existence and achievements of the Soviet Union, the victory of the great Chinese people, the heroic resistance of the Korean people against the barbaric American aggressors and their "allies," and the struggles of the people of Vietnam, Iran, and Egypt have greatly strengthened the will of the patriotic people of Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia to fight for liberation. Now, under the leadership of the Communist Party and under the banner of the united front, the scale of the North African national liberation struggle is growing ever larger. For twenty-eight months, Algerian dockworkers have consistently refused to load ships carrying war materials to Vietnam and refused to unload war materials transported from other places; workers at the American military base in Nouaceur, Morocco, and farmworkers in the Daiga de Guesh region of Algeria and the Anfida village of Tunisia have held large-scale strikes, dealing a powerful blow to the colonialists. The establishment of the All-Algeria Front for the Defense of Freedom and the submission of the Moroccan question to the United Nations are clear evidence that this struggle has reached a new high tide.

    Hai Ali said that imperialism wants to establish a base for an anti-Soviet war in North Africa, so on the one hand, it uses bloody suppression, intimidation, and bribery and other barbaric and despicable means to "appease" North Africa, and on the other hand, it is stepping up preparations for war in North Africa. At present, there are 50,000 American soldiers in Morocco, and the construction of bases is being accelerated; Algeria has also been forcibly dragged into the North Atlantic aggressive system. Therefore, the national liberation struggle of the North African people is inseparable from the struggle for peace. At present, North African patriots are actively preparing for the Conference of People of Near, Middle East and North African Countries for Peace and National Independence, scheduled to be held in Cairo in January 1952.

    Hai Ali finally emphasized that the people of North Africa have full confidence and are convinced that they will win victory, freedom, and independence.

### 阿尔及利亚共产党书记  论北非民族解放运动

    阿尔及利亚共产党书记
    论北非民族解放运动
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：阿尔及利亚共产党中央委员会书记哈伊·阿里二十三日在“真理报”发表文章，论北非人民的民族解放运动。
    哈伊·阿里首先指出：苏联的存在和它的成就，伟大的中国人民的胜利，朝鲜人民对野蛮的美国侵略者及其“盟国”的英勇抵抗，越南、伊朗、埃及人民的斗争：在在都使阿尔及利亚、摩洛哥和突尼斯爱国人民争取解放的意志大大加强。现在，在共产党的领导下，在统一战线的旗帜下，北非民族解放斗争的规模已经越来越宏大了。阿尔及利亚码头工人在二十八个月来始终拒绝为载运战争物资到越南去的船只装货，并拒绝起卸外地运来的战争物资；摩洛哥努瓦塞尔美国军事基地的工人、阿尔及利亚戴加代什地方和突尼斯安非达村的农场工人，都举行了大罢工，使殖民主义者受到有力的打击。而全阿尔及利亚保卫自由战线的成立和摩洛哥问题的提交联合国，更是这个斗争达到新高潮的明证。
    哈伊·阿里说：帝国主义要在北非建立反苏战争的根据地，就一边用血腥镇压、恫吓和收买等种种野蛮的、卑鄙的手段来“安抚”北非，一边在北非加紧备战。现在，摩洛哥已有五万美国兵，建筑基地的工程正在加紧进行；而阿尔及利亚也被硬拖进了北大西洋侵略体系。因此，北非人民的民族解放斗争，是和争取和平的斗争分不开的。现在，北非的爱国分子正在为定于一九五二年一月在开罗举行的近、中东和北非各国人民争取和平、争取民族独立大会积极作准备。
    哈伊·阿里最后强调说：北非人民有充分的信心，确信他们一定会赢得胜利、自由和独立。
