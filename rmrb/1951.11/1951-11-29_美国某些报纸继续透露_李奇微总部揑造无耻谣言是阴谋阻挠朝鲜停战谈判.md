Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 28th: TASS, New York, November 28th: Some editorials and letters to the editor published in American newspapers continue to show that the so-called "atrocity report" of the US military POWs being murdered, which was recently issued by the American Command in Korea, is a propaganda tactic used to obstruct the Korean peace negotiations. The "Cleveland Plain Dealer," an influential conservative newspaper in the American Midwest, demanded in its editorial last week that Congress investigate why Colonel Hanley released this report when everyone knew that the "atrocity" report would have a negative impact on the armistice negotiations. The "Cleveland Plain Dealer" pointed out that Ridgway's subsequent statement did not answer the inexplicable questions raised in people's minds by the Hanley report. The newspaper said that people want to know why officials say the number of people who died from "atrocities" is one number at one time, and another number at another time, like this in one newspaper and like that in another newspaper.

The newspaper also published a letter from a reader, which read: "Speaking of barbaric actions, we must remind Mr. Acheson and some of our newspapers that the Chinese have not used napalm bombs like us to destroy village after village of men, women, and children in Korea with fire. Allied forces estimate that at least two million civilian deaths have been caused by our intervention by the US-UN forces. In addition, the leveled cities, our 'scorched earth' policy, and at least four million refugees, and at least 100,000 orphans - these are not even included. Isn't the war itself and our participation in this war an indefensible and heinous atrocity!"

Black troops in Korea refused to believe rumors of "atrocities." Their indignation is reflected in the communication of Mathews, the only black reporter stationed in Korea. The Washington black newspaper "American African" published Mathews' communication under the title "The Alleged Massacre of Six Thousand Soldiers is Unfounded." The communication began by saying: "There is currently no conclusive evidence to prove that American soldiers captured by enemy forces have been massacred."

Mathews quoted some reactions from black soldiers. Mathews wrote: "One black soldier said that he was more angry when he heard about the Florida police chief killing prisoners than when he heard about the Korean atrocities." Another soldier suggested not blaming others, but rather ending the war and exchanging prisoners.

    美国某些报纸继续透露
    李奇微总部揑造无耻谣言是阴谋阻挠朝鲜停战谈判
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社纽约二十八日讯：美国报纸上发表的一些社评和读者来信继续表明：朝鲜美国司令部不久前发表的纯属捏造的所谓美军战俘被杀害的“暴行报告”是用来阻挠朝鲜和平谈判的宣传策略。美国中西部有影响的保守报纸“克利夫兰实话报”上周的社论要求国会调查汉莱上校为什么在大家都知道“暴行”报告会对停战谈判有不利影响的时候发表这种报告。“克利夫兰实话报”指出，李奇微后来的声明并没有回答汉莱报告在人们脑海中引起的莫名其妙的问题，该报说，人们希望知道，为什么官员们一会说死于“暴行”之下的人数是这样，一会又说是那样，在这个报纸上说是这样，在那个报纸上又说是那样。
    该报也发表了一位读者的来信，信中写道：“谈到野蛮行动，我们必须提醒艾奇逊先生和我们的某些报纸，中国人还没有像我们一样，使用凝固汽油弹，用火来毁灭朝鲜一村一村的男女和小孩。联军人士估计，由于美国——联合国军的干涉，至少有两百万平民的死亡是我们造成的。此外，夷为平地的城市，我们的“焦土”政策，和至少四百万难民，至少十万孤儿——这些还没有计算在内。战争本身和我们参加这个战争，不就是一个无法辩护的令人发指的暴行吗！”
    在朝鲜的黑人部队拒绝听信“暴行”这类的谣言，它们的愤慨的情绪反映在驻朝鲜的唯一的黑人记者马休斯的通讯里。华盛顿的黑人报纸“美国非洲人报”在“所说六千个军人被屠杀是莫须有的事”的标题之下刊载了马休斯的通讯。通讯开头就说：“现在没有任何肯定的证据可以证明为敌军所俘掳的美国军人曾被屠杀。”
    马休斯引述了黑人兵士的一些反应。马休斯写道：“一个黑人兵士说，他听到佛罗里达警察局长杀害囚徒的消息比听到朝鲜暴行的消息更为愤怒。”另一个兵士建议不要责难人家，最好还是结束战争，并交换俘虏。
