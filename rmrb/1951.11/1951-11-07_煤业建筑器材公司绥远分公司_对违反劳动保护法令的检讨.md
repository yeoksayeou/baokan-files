    Suiyuan Branch of China Coal Industry Construction Materials Company
    Self-Criticism for Violating Labor Protection Laws
    Editor: The criticism made by reader Liang Yaoxing in the People's Daily on October 4th regarding our company's violation of labor protection laws is entirely correct. We not only accept this criticism but also make a public self-criticism:
    The incident of the mover Zhang Zhongdu being injured twice while unloading timber was not discovered by our company until the Guihua City Federation of Trade Unions sent someone to the trade union to understand the situation. At that time, we ideologically believed that since Zhang Zhongdu was a piece-rate worker, we should not be responsible for his medical treatment; at the same time, we also felt that these expenses could not be covered. Only after the relevant provincial and municipal authorities put forward their opinions on how to handle the matter did we seriously address it and conduct a self-criticism. This incident shows, on the one hand, that we did not pay enough attention to the safety of workers and did not realize that relying on workers is the key to running the enterprise well; on the other hand, it shows that we have not studied the labor protection laws sufficiently. In the future, we must strengthen our study, improve our policy understanding, and clarify our ideology of relying on the working class to run the people's enterprise well.
    China Coal Industry Construction Materials Company, Suiyuan Branch

    对违反劳动保护法令的检讨
    编辑同志：人民日报十月四日刊载的读者梁耀兴对我公司违反劳动保护法令的批评，完全是正确的。我们除表示接受外，并作公开检讨：
    搬运工人张仲度因卸木材两度受伤的事情，我公司直至归绥市总工会派人来工会了解情况时才发觉。当时，我们在思想上认为张仲度既然是包件工人，我们就不应负治疗的责任；同时，也认为这笔经费无法开支。经过省、市有关机关提出处理意见后，我们才认真处理，并作了检讨。从这件事情上，一方面说明我们对工人的安全是不够重视的，没有认识到依靠工人是搞好企业的关键；另一方面说明我们对劳动保护法令学习得也是不够的。今后，我们必须加强学习，提高政策水平，明确依靠工人阶级的思想，来搞好人民的企业。
