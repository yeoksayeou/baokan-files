The patriotic production increase movement of farmers in the suburbs of Beijing has achieved remarkable results. According to incomplete statistics, the income of suburban farmers in agricultural production this year has increased by 13.6% compared to last year, exceeding Mayor Peng Zhen's requirement to strive for an increase of 5% to 10% compared to last year. The income from sideline production has also doubled compared to last year. In total, before autumn this year, the total value of increased production in agriculture and sideline occupations by farmers in the suburbs of Beijing was 59.6577 billion yuan, equivalent to the value of forty fighter planes.

Currently, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Suburban Work Committee has formulated a plan for the winter production increase and frugality campaign in the suburbs this year. In this plan, the Suburban Work Committee calls on all farmers to consolidate their achieved production results, prevent waste, and expand reproduction. The specific requirements for increasing production and practicing frugality are: (1) Strive for every farmer's household in the suburbs to establish a winter production increase and frugality plan; (2) Launch a winter plowing campaign, requiring 95% of arable land to be plowed before the ground freezes (last year it was 90%), and launch a manure accumulation campaign, striving for three cartloads of manure per mu (each cartload is 1500 catties) in the near suburbs next year, one cartload of manure per mu in the far suburbs, and two cartloads of manure per mu in general areas; (3) According to different conditions in different regions, organize farmers to carry out winter sideline production in many ways, striving to increase income from sideline production by 36.3 billion yuan this winter, in order to prepare better conditions for the large-scale patriotic production increase movement next year.

In order to ensure the completion of this winter's production increase and frugality plan, the Municipal Suburban Work Committee has specially instructed leading cadres at all levels, requiring them to do three things well: (1) Starting from convening district and village representative meetings, reviewing patriotic pacts, and formulating district, village, and household production increase and frugality plans, overcome the incorrect thinking of some people who "are unwilling to do small profits and cannot find big profits," mobilize the masses, and launch a mass production increase and frugality competition; (2) Through the election of labor models and frugality models, establish banners and drive the masses; (3) Strengthen and expand the existing production guidance committees (to be renamed production increase and frugality committees) in districts and villages, so that they effectively become powerful organizations leading the regular work of the rural production increase and frugality movement.

    北京郊区农业生产
    较去年提高一成多
    北京市郊区农民的爱国主义增产运动，成绩显著。据不完全的统计，郊区农民今年在农业生产方面的收入，较去年增加百分之一三点六，超过了彭真市长争取比去年提高半成到一成的要求；在副业生产方面的收入，也较去年增加了一倍。总计今年秋前，北京郊区农民在农、副业上增加生产的总值是五百九十六亿五千七百万元，相当于四十架战斗机的价值。
    现在，北京市人民政府郊区工作委员会已制订了今年冬季郊区增产节约运动的计划。在这个计划里，郊区工作委员会号召全体农民巩固已得的生产成绩，防止浪费，扩大再生产。增产节约的具体要求是：（一）争取郊区农民家家订立冬季增产节约计划；（二）开展冬耕运动，要求在地冻以前耕完可耕地的百分之九十五（去年是百分之九十），并开展积肥运动，争取明年近郊每亩地上三车粪（每车一五○○斤），远郊每亩地上一车粪，一般地区每亩地上两车粪；（三）根据不同地区不同情况，从多方面组织农民开展冬季副业生产，争取今年冬天在副业生产上增加收入三百六十三亿元，为来年大规模的爱国增产运动准备更好的条件。
    为了保证今冬增产节约计划的完成，市郊区工作委员会特别指示各级领导干部，要求他们必须做好三件事：（一）从召开区村代表会，检查爱国公约，制订区村户增产节约计划着手，克服某些人的 “小利不愿干，大利找不见”的不正确思想，发动群众，开展群众性的增产节约竞赛；（二）通过选举劳动模范和节约模范的工作，树立旗帜，带动群众；（三）加强和扩大现有区村的生产指导委员会（改称增产节约委员会），使它切实地成为领导农村增产节约运动经常工作的强有力的机构。
