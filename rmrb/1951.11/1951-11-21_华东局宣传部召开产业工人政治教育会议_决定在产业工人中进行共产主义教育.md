    East China Bureau Propaganda Department Convenes Political Education Meeting for Industrial Workers
    Decides to Conduct Communist Education Among Industrial Workers
    The Propaganda Department of the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened the East China Industrial Workers Political Education Meeting from October 25th to November 1st, deciding to conduct education on Communism and the Communist Party among all industrial workers. In addition to the heads of education sections and responsible comrades of the cultural and educational departments of trade unions from each province, district, Shanghai, Nanjing, and cities with more than 10,000 industrial workers, representatives from relevant East China-level departments also attended the meeting. The Propaganda Department of the East China Bureau attached great importance to this meeting. At the meeting, twelve typical work reports were organized, and the past situation of political education for workers was reviewed. Comrade Rao Shushi gave a report on current affairs, and Comrades Liu Changsheng and Wu Liangping gave reports on urban work and worker political education. Finally, Comrade Shu Tong gave a comprehensive speech, which enabled the comrades present to deeply recognize the importance of this meeting. The meeting was very fruitful.
  The meeting affirmed that the East China region's worker political education work over the past two years has been successful. This is mainly reflected in the initial education on the situation, tasks, and policies during the takeover period, as well as the preliminary class enlightenment education on historical materialism; the extensive and in-depth patriotic education to resist America and aid Korea carried out in recent years; the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the publicity and education on the Labor Insurance Regulations that began this summer; and the education on the democratic reform movement currently underway. This has initially stimulated the workers' class consciousness, enabled them to begin to recognize the flesh-and-blood relationship between the Communist Party and the working class, and to begin to establish the idea of the working class leading the revolution and managing state power as masters. This year on "July 1st", many workers in Shanghai and Nantong textile factories ate noodles with their families to celebrate the birthday of the Communist Party. After the democratic reform movement in Jinan factories, many activist workers inquired about the requirements for becoming a Party member and asked to join the Communist Party. According to statistics from June this year, 330,000 workers in the East China region participated in the patriotic production movement. In addition, in the work of developing Party members, training trade union cadres, and Communist Youth League members over the past two years, according to incomplete statistics, more than 144,000 worker activists have undergone more specialized and systematic political training on or off the job, cultivating a group of worker backbones. However, it cannot be denied that there are still some shortcomings in past worker political education. For example, there was more education on current political tasks of a crash nature, and less systematic education on Communism and the Communist Party. Moreover, the cultural and educational departments of trade unions in some places once unilaterally emphasized the principle of focusing on cultural education, stopping political education for workers; or only focusing on vocational education and not on political education; or due to the idea of some enterprise administrative leaders who belittled political work and their "single-handed" style, they hindered the systematic political education of workers. This is mainly because the Party committees at all levels lacked a complete plan and unified leadership for worker political education; many Party committee propaganda departments have not seriously managed worker education, nor have they promptly solved specific problems such as teaching materials and teachers, nor have they promptly corrected various deviations and improved worker political education.
  The meeting decided that before the end of 1953, a general education on Communism and the Communist Party should be conducted among all industrial workers in the region, and in conjunction with the work of Party building and various cadre training programs, relatively systematic training should be conducted for about one-third of the activists (including Communist Youth League members and grassroots trade union cadres) who make up the total industrial workers. This training is to be carried out using the following methods: (1) Party schools and cadre schools will recruit backbones from among the workers for training; (2) City factory and mining Party committees will hold a large number of off-the-job and amateur short-term training courses; (3) Workers will be invited to attend Party lectures; (4) All worker training courses lasting more than one month (including trade union cadre schools and other technical and business training courses) shall include a lecture on Communism and the Communist Party; (5) Political education for ordinary industrial workers will mainly be conducted in workers' spare-time schools.
  The implementation steps of the above political education are: in factories and mines where democratic reform is being carried out, initial education on class and the Party should first be carried out in conjunction with the movement; in factories and mines where the democratic reform movement has ended, systematic education on Communism and the Communist Party should be launched in a step-by-step manner; in factories and mines where democratic reform has not been carried out, education should first be carried out among Party members and activists. At present, all localities should immediately prepare for typical experiments, compile teaching materials, and train teachers. The problem of teaching materials will be solved temporarily by adopting the following methods: Party members' reading materials can be used for industrial worker activists; separate, concise teaching materials should be compiled for ordinary industrial workers. According to the experience of some factories in Qingdao and Shanghai, education on the history of workers' struggles is extremely helpful in stimulating workers' consciousness and their understanding of the Party. Therefore, all localities can collect historical materials on the workers' movement to compile supplementary teaching materials.

    华东局宣传部召开产业工人政治教育会议
    决定在产业工人中进行共产主义教育
    中共中央华东局宣传部于十月二十五日至十一月一日召开了华东产业工人政治教育会议，决定在全体产业工人中进行共产主义与共产党的教育。出席这次会议的除各省、区、上海、南京及有一万产业工人以上城市的党委宣传部教育处处长和工会文教部负责同志等外，尚有华东级有关部门的代表。华东局宣传部对这次会议非常重视。会上，组织了十二个典型性的工作汇报，对过去工人政治教育状况作了检讨；并请饶漱石同志作了时事报告，刘长胜、吴亮平同志作了关于城市工作与工人政治教育的报告，最后由舒同同志作了综合发言。使到会同志深刻地认识了这次会议的重要性。会议收获很大。
  会议肯定了华东过去两年多来的工人政治教育工作是有成绩的。这主要表现在接管初期进行了形势、任务与政策的教育，以及初步的唯物史观的阶级启蒙教育；年来进行了广泛深入的抗美援朝爱国主义教育；由今夏开始的镇压反革命、劳动保险条例宣传教育；以及目前正在开展的民主改革运动的教育。这样就初步启发了工人的阶级觉悟，使他们开始认识到共产党与工人阶级的血肉关系和开始树立工人阶级领导革命及管理国家政权的主人翁思想。今年“七一”，上海及南通纱厂许多工人全家吃面，庆贺共产党的生日。济南工厂经过民主改革运动之后，许多工人积极分子打听党员条件，要求参加共产党。据今年六月统计，华东全区有三十三万工人参加了爱国主义生产运动。此外，两年多来，在发展党员，训练工会干部与青年团员等工作中，据不完全统计，又对十四万四千多工人积极分子进行了离职或业余的较专门较系统的政治训练，培养了一批工人骨干。但是不能否认过去工人政治教育还存在一些缺点，例如带突击性的时事政治任务的教育多，系统的关于共产主义和共产党的教育少。而且某些地方的工会文教部门一度片面强调以文化教育为主的方针，停止了对工人的政治教育；或者只注重业务教育，不注重政治教育；或者由于某些企业行政领导干部轻视政治工作的思想以及
  “单打一”的作风，妨碍了系统地在工人中进行政治教育。这主要因为各级党委对工人政治教育缺乏完整的计划与统一的领导；许多党委宣传部门还没有认真去管理工人教育，也没有及时解决教材、师资等具体问题，没有及时纠正各种偏向，改进工人政治教育工作。
  会议确定在一九五三年底以前，对全区产业工人普遍进行一次共产主义与共产党的教育，并结合建党与各种训练干部的工作，对约占全体产业工人三分之一的积极分子（包括青年团员、工会基层干部）进行较有系统的训练。这种训练，准备采用以下几种方法进行：（一）党校、干部学校吸收工人中的骨干加以训练；（二）城市厂矿党委会大量举办离职的业余的短期训练班；（三）在上党课时吸收工人参加听课；（四）一个月以上的工人训练班（包括工会干部学校及其他技术业务训练班在内）一律讲解一次共产主义与共产党；（五）对普通产业工人的政治教育，主要在职工业余学校中进行。
  上述政治教育的实施步骤是：在正进行民主改革的厂矿，首先结合运动进行关于阶级与党的初步教育；在民主改革运动已经结束的厂矿就有步骤地展开系统的共产主义与共产党的教育；未进行民主改革的厂矿，则首先在党员与积极分子中进行教育。目前各地应即准备进行典型试验，编写教材，训练教员。教材问题，暂时采取以下办法解决：对产业工人积极分子，可用党员读本；对普通产业工人，另编简要教材。另据青岛、上海一些工厂的经验，工人斗争史的教育，极有助于启发工人觉悟与对党的认识，因此各地可搜集工人运动史料编写辅助教材。
