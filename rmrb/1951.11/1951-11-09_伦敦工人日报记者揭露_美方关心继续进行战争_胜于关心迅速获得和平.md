Xinhua News Agency, Eighth Dispatch: London "Daily Worker" reporter Alan Winnington reported from Panmunjom on the 7th: The formal proposal put forward by the Korean and Chinese side on the afternoon of the 7th has taken into account every U.S. objection. Unless the U.S. side raises new objections, or groundlessly insists on demanding Kaesong or other areas on the contact line. U.S. press officer Nokes told United Nations reporters that if a ceasefire line agreement stops the war before a truce agreement is signed, then some terrible tragedy may occur. At the same time, he repeated the old lies and emphasized that the Korean and Chinese side agreed that the war should continue until the end of the meeting. He thereby revealed the fact that the U.S. cares more about continuing the war than about resolving differences and quickly achieving peace. In fact, the Korean and Chinese side merely accepted Joy's constantly published statement—that there is no agreement to stop the war yet. But the Korean and Chinese side never agreed that the war should continue. The U.S. has launched several offensives while negotiations are continuing, so the attitude of the Korean and Chinese side is very clear. If the U.S. now insists on rejecting this proposal from the Korean and Chinese side—a proposal that takes into account all their stated objections, allowing them to freely choose whether to continue the war or seek peace—this proposal also appropriately resolves the second item on the agenda, allowing the delegation to avoid wasting time on technical issues and proceed to discuss other issues. This proposal also stipulates adjustments to be made in the future and clearly defines the principles of the ceasefire line, without any potentially dangerous ambiguities that could undermine the negotiations in the future. If the U.S. insists on rejecting this proposal, the public will know who should bear the responsibility for all the consequences. The initial reaction of the U.S. reporters on the afternoon of the 7th to this proposal was: "We can go home before Christmas. It looks like it takes all our objections into account. This proposal looks very good. This may finally be a real way to break the deadlock."

    伦敦工人日报记者揭露
    美方关心继续进行战争
    胜于关心迅速获得和平
    【新华社八日讯】伦敦工人日报记者阿兰·魏宁顿七日自板门店报道：七日下午朝中方面提出的正式建议，对美方每一个反对意见都已予以照顾了，除非美方又提出新的反对意见，或毫无理由地坚持要求取得开城或接触线这边的其他地区。美方新闻发布官纳科斯告诉联合国记者说，假如停火线协议使战争在停战协定签定前停止，那么就可能发生什么可怖的悲剧。同时，他又把老一套的谎言重述一遍并且加以强调，说什么朝中方面同意战事应继续进行到会议结束时为止。他因此泄露了这样的事实：美方关心继续进行战争，胜于关心解决分歧及迅速获得和平。实际上朝中方面不过是接受了乔埃不断发表的声明——尚没有停止战争的协议——而已。但朝中方面从未同意战事应继续打下去。美方已发动数次攻势，而谈判在继续进行中，因此，朝中方面的态度怎样是很清楚的。假如美方现在坚持拒绝朝中方面这次建议——这个建议把他们表示的一切反对意见都考虑在内，使他们可以随意自由选择究竟是进行战争还是谋求和平。这个建议也适当地解决了议程的第二项，使代表团可以不在技术问题上浪费时间进而讨论其他问题。这个建议又规定了在以后进行调整并清楚地确定了停火线原则，一点没有会在以后破坏谈判的具有潜在危险的含糊的地方。假如美方坚持拒绝这一建议的话，公众将知道一切后果的责任应由谁来负。美方记者七日下午对这个建议的初步反应是：“在圣诞节前可以回家了。看起来它把我们的反对意见全都考虑在内了。这个建议看起来很好。这可能终于是真正的打破僵局的办法。”
