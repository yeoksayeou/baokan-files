　　Oppose Anti-Historical Tendencies in Opera Reform

    Editor's Note: Since this newspaper published Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's article "On the Harmfulness of 'Art for Art's Sake and Literature for Literature's Sake'" on the 3rd of this month, we have received more than 140 letters from readers by the 14th, all pointing out that Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's artistic ideas and attitude towards criticism are wrong. Due to space limitations, we cannot publish all the letters. What is published here is a part of the letters.

    Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's Artistic Thought Violates Historical Materialism

    Editor: I think Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's artistic thought expressed in the opera reform work is wrong. I have seen "New Daming Prefecture" which he wrote, and it is like modern people wearing ancient costumes acting in a play. This kind of hard-headed addition of modern people's thoughts to historical figures cannot achieve the effect of educating the audience, but instead makes the audience greatly doubt the authenticity of the content of the play. At that time, I and several comrades felt very awkward after watching this play. I have seen "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai" performed by the East China Yue Opera Troupe, and Peking Opera "Havoc in Heaven by Monkey King." These mythological plays and local operas have also been adapted, but these modifications are in line with the historical truth at the time and did not destroy the beauty of the original folk tales and myths. The content of these plays expresses the people's strong resistance to feudal rulers and the people's infinite power. For example, Monkey King defeated the heavenly soldiers and generals' net and went straight to the Hall of Supreme Harmony, drove away the Jade Emperor, and smashed the sacred idols of the feudal rulers, making the audience feel very happy and gaining education from it. The Soviet folk tale films "The Stone Flower," "The Magic Horse," and "The Magic Treasure Box" have all played a good educational role for the broad masses of the audience. This method of dealing with mythological dramas is correct. As for Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's method of dealing with mythological dramas, I think it violates the principles of historical materialism. A soldier of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Jiang Ping

    Should Respect the Nation's Beautiful Artistic Heritage

    Editor: I am a worker and I love literature and art, but I don't know much about literary theory. After repeatedly reading Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's article, I feel that this is not a literary criticism, but a retaliatory piece of writing.

    I agree with Comrade Ai Qing's opinion that our excellent national heritage and beautiful myths should not be arbitrarily ruined. In Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's "New Celestial Marriage," the old cow sings Lu Xun's poem "Fierce-browed, I coolly face a thousand pointing fingers, Head-bowed, I willingly serve as an ox for the children," and uses owls to insinuate imperialists, thus confusing myths and legends with the current reality. I think that today the people have already grasped political power, and drama workers can fully praise the motherland, praise the people, expose the enemy, and strike at the enemy through appropriate drama forms. It is not necessary or possible to use myths to reflect the current reality and the Resist America, Aid Korea movement.

    Comrade Yang Shaoxuan quoted the fable of "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" used by Chairman Mao in an attempt to defend his erroneous views, which is incorrect. Chairman Mao's words are a vivid and powerful metaphor to encourage the people to overthrow feudalism and imperialism. This has nothing in common with Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's use of myths to insinuate reality.

    Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's attitude towards criticism is extremely wrong. Not only does he not humbly consider the opinions others have given him and accept correct criticism from others, but he also slanders the critics and even asks the party newspaper editor to conduct a thorough review. I think it is not others who should conduct a thorough review, but Comrade Yang Shaoxuan himself. Hu Shouyi, Telegraph Office, Beijing Telecommunications Bureau

    Seriously Treat the Work of Adapting Mythological Dramas

    Editor: I am a medical worker. I think Ai Qing's opinion in the article "Talking About 'The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl'" is correct. Yang Shaoxuan's article is malicious and unprincipled abuse and cannot be regarded as literary criticism.

    We must seriously treat our national artistic heritage. From those beautiful folk tales, we can see our ancestors' comprehensive views on natural phenomena, labor, love, and struggle. Literary and art workers can only make it more perfect, but they have no right to ruin it casually. Current political slogans cannot be stiffly added in like sticking posters, completely regardless of the basic spirit of that myth. Using myths to insinuate reality is very far-fetched. It is not only easy to ruin beautiful myths, but also easy to distort reality. In the vigorous Resist America, Aid Korea movement, countless touching real stories and heroic figures have emerged. Wouldn't it be better to write these people and things positively to educate the people? Qian Shaozhen, Medical Worker, Shanghai

    Mythological Dramas Cannot Reflect the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement

    Editor: The method of "borrowing the past to satirize the present" in opera reform had a certain progressive significance during the Kuomintang reactionary rule. Because the people did not have freedom of speech and publication at that time, writers used this method to expose the crimes of the reactionary rulers and fight against the Kuomintang's censorship system. However, it should be said that this method is anti-historical. Today, it is no longer necessary to adopt this method. Today, the people's publication and speech have full freedom, and the people's struggle life is so vivid and rich that writers can fully exert their talents and use appropriate artistic forms to reflect real life. How can adding modern people's thoughts, feelings, words, and actions to mythological dramas that reflect the ancient people's lives make the audience believe in the plot and thus be moved and educated? Comrade Yang Shaoxuan believes that using mythological dramas to insinuate reality and using mythological dramas to reflect the Resist America, Aid Korea movement is the real historical materialism. This understanding is wrong.
        Yu Chuanfu, No. 44, Fangjia Hutong, Andingmen Street, Beijing

    Oppose Turning Myths into Tools for Insinuating Reality

    Editor: I oppose Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's opinion. I believe that if myths are used to insinuate reality, it will inevitably destroy the original beauty of the myths and weaken the educational significance of real life. This is a "lose-lose" method, which destroys the myths and reduces the seriousness of real problems. This approach shows that the author lacks a mass viewpoint and also shows that the author has not started from the spirit of patriotism to respect his nation's mythological creation, but lightly ruins the myths. He Feng, Beijing Normal University

    Labor Production and Class Struggle Are the Source of Artistic Creation

    Editor: Comrade Yang Shaoxuan advocates using myths to insinuate reality and adapting modern characters and their ideologies into mythological dramas. I think this is a thought that despises the artistic talents of the working people. He believes that in the old society, workers and peasants "mostly lost (should be changed to were deprived of) the opportunity for cultural education," "so it is even more impossible to talk about how high their literary and artistic level" is. Comrade Yang seems not to understand a very simple common sense, that is, the source of artistic creation is the labor production and class struggle of the people. Although the working people in the old society were deprived of the right to receive cultural education, their artistic creative talents still existed. Although they could not write or write books, they could dance, speak, and sing, so a large number of beautiful dances, myths, legends, stories, folk songs, and ballads were produced. Cherishing the nation's beautiful artistic heritage and respecting the artistic creative ability of the ancient working people is a concrete manifestation of patriotism.
                Liu Haoran, Industrial School Attached to Tianjin University

    Oppose the Rude and Unreasonable Attitude Towards Criticism

    Editor: I think Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's attitude towards criticism is very wrong. He lacks the most basic spirit of self-criticism. He regards Comrade Ai Qing's criticism of his works as a "blow" to him personally and regards the correct opinions of his comrades as "helping the enemy." And he said that Comrade Ai Qing "pointed the gun internally, helped the enemy," and "attacked the revolution and benefited the enemy." This kind of attitude of not distinguishing between ourselves and the enemy and being rude and unreasonable is something that a revolutionary literary and art worker should not have. Shouldn't we carry out literary and art criticism? Why does one show this kind of arrogant attitude when others have raised some criticisms of one's own works? I completely agree with Comrade Ma Shaobo's opinion: "Facts have proved that it is not others who are wrong, but Comrade Yang Shaoxuan himself" (see "Seriously Treat the Work of Sorting Out Mythological Dramas" in the People's Daily on November 4). Therefore, it is not others who should conduct a thorough review, but Comrade Yang Shaoxuan!
            Shi Ming, Office of the Fourteenth District of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions

    It Is Wrong to Reject Comrades' Well-Intentioned Criticism

    Editor: I think Comrade Yang Shaoxuan not only does not sincerely accept comrades' well-intentioned criticism, but also shows a very bad attitude. He tries to stop criticism arbitrarily. He said in his letter to the People's Daily: "After Ai Qing's article was published, it immediately produced a bad result... In short, it caused ideological confusion among cadres." Is this the true situation? Isn't it good to carry out serious criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals? Will it produce any "bad results" or cause any "confusion"? Even if the criticism is incorrect, the criticized person can propose correct opinions to correct it, how can it cause "bad results" and "confusion"? If the criticism is correct, it should be accepted honestly and corrected actively, and it will not cause "bad results" and "confusion." Attacking and trying to stop criticism is of no benefit to discussing problems and correcting one's own mistakes.
                Xu Qiwen, China Coal Industry Building Materials Company

    Who Are the "People with a Sense of Justice" That Comrade Yang Shaoxuan Refers To?

    Editor: I think Comrade Ai Qing's opinion is basically correct, and Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's position and views are problematic. Comrade Yang Shaoxuan attacked Comrade Ai Qing with vicious abuse and adopted a rude and arrogant attitude towards criticism and self-criticism. He even said in his third letter to the People's Daily: "People with a sense of justice know it but dare not say it. Those who watch the wind and sail the boat will naturally tout it." This is even more extremely absurd and wrong! May I ask Comrade Yang Shaoxuan, who are the people with a sense of justice that you are referring to? Who are those who watch the wind and sail the boat? In a new democratic society, only counter-revolutionaries have no freedom and no right to speak, while the people have full freedom of speech and publication. Does Comrade Yang Shaoxuan think that there is anyone or anything today that suppresses people with a sense of justice, so that they "dare not speak"? Does he mean that adhering to the truth and agreeing with others' correct opinions is watching the wind and sailing the boat and touting for others? I think Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's statement is an unreasonable resistance to correct criticism and also a slander against serious literary and artistic ideological struggle.

专栏：读者来信

    读者来信
　　反对戏曲改革中的反历史主义倾向
    编者按：本报自本月三日发表杨绍萱同志的 “论‘为文学而文学、为艺术而艺术’的危害性”一文后，截至十四日止，收到读者来信一百四十多封，一致指出，杨绍萱同志的艺术思想和对待批评的态度都是错误的。本报因篇幅限制，不能将来信全部发表，在这里所发表的是来信中的一部分。
    杨绍萱同志的艺术思想是违反历史唯物主义的
    编辑同志：我认为杨绍萱同志在戏曲改革工作中所表现的艺术思想是错误的。我看过他编的“新大名府”，像是现代的人物穿着古装在演戏。这种硬将现代人的思想加到历史人物身上去，并不能够收到教育观众的效果，反而使观众对戏的内容的真实性发生极大怀疑。当时我和几位同志看了这戏后感到很蹩扭。我曾经看过华东越剧团演的“梁山伯与祝英台”，以及京剧“孙悟空大闹天宫”，这些神话戏和地方戏也是经过了改编的，但这些修改是符合当时的历史真实的，并没有破坏原来民间传说和神话的美丽。这些戏的内容表现了人民对封建统治者的强烈反抗，以及人民的无穷的力量。如孙悟空击败了天兵天将的天罗地网，一直打到灵霄宝殿，把玉皇大帝赶跑，把封建统治者的神圣的偶像打垮，使观众感到很大的痛快，并从这里获得了教育。苏联的民间传说影片“宝石花”、“千里驹”、“宝盒仙笛”等，对广大观众都起了良好的教育作用。这种处理神话剧的方法是正确的。至于杨绍萱同志处理神话剧的方法，我认为是违反历史唯物主义的原则的。中国人民解放军某部　江萍
    应该尊重民族的优美的艺术遗产
    编辑同志：我是一个工人，我喜爱文艺，但对于文艺理论知道的不多。我反复地看了杨绍萱同志的文章后，我觉得这不像一篇文艺批评，而是一篇报复性质的文字。
    我同意艾青同志的意见，我们的优秀的民族遗产、美丽的神话是不容许任意糟塌的。在杨绍萱同志的“新天河配”里，出现了老牛唱鲁迅的“横眉冷对千夫指，俯首甘为孺子牛”的诗句，用?枭影射帝国主义者，这样就把神话传说和当前现实混淆起来了。我以为在今天人民已经掌握了政权，戏剧工作者可以通过适当的戏剧形式来尽情地歌颂祖国，歌颂人民，揭露敌人，打击敌人。不必要也不可能用神话来反映当前现实和抗美援朝运动。
    杨绍萱同志引证毛主席所运用的“愚公移山”的寓言，来企图为自己的错误观点辩护，这是不对的。毛主席的话是一个生动有力的比喻，用以鼓舞人民推翻封建主义和帝国主义，这和杨绍萱同志的以神话影射现实绝无相同之处。
    杨绍萱同志对待批评的态度是极错误的。他不但不虚心考虑别人给他提出的意见，接受别人的正确批评，反而对批评者横加诬蔑，甚至要求党报编辑彻底检讨。我看，应该彻底检讨的不是别人，正是杨绍萱同志自己。　北京电信局电报处　胡守义
    严肃地对待改编神话剧的工作
    编辑同志：我是一个医务工作者。我觉得艾青的
    “谈‘牛郎织女’”一文的意见是正确的，杨绍萱的文章，是恶意的毫无原则的谩骂，算不得文艺批评。
    我们必须严肃地对待我们的民族艺术遗产。从那些美丽的民间传说中，我们可以看到我们的祖先对自然现象、劳动、爱情、斗争的一些观念的综合。文艺工作者只有使它更完美，而没有权力随便糟塌它。不能把当前的政治口号像贴标语似地生硬地加进去，完全不管那个神话的基本精神。用神话影射现实，是很牵强的，不但容易糟塌了美丽的神话，而且也容易歪曲了现实。在轰轰烈烈抗美援朝运动中，产生了无数可歌可泣的现实故事和英雄人物，把这些人和事正面写出来去教育人民，不是更好吗？　上海市医务工作者　钱绍祯
    神话剧不能反映抗美援朝
    编辑同志：戏曲改革中的“借古喻今”的方法，在国民党反动统治时期是有一定的进步意义的。由于那时人民没有言论出版自由，作家就采用这种方法揭露反动统治者的罪恶，与国民党的检查制度进行斗争。但是应该说，这种方法是反历史主义的。在今天，已经不需要采取这种方法了。在今天，人民的出版言论已有了充分的自由，人民的斗争生活又是这样生动丰富，作家可以充分地发挥他们的才能，用适当的艺术形式来反映现实生活。在反映古代人民生活的神话剧里加进现代人的思想感情和语言行动，怎么能使观众相信剧情，因而受到感动、获得教育呢？杨绍萱同志认为用神话剧影射现实，用神话剧反映抗美援朝运动，才是真正的历史唯物主义。这种认识是错误的。
        北京安定门大街方家胡同四十四号　余传绂
    反对把神话变成影射现实的工具
    编辑同志：我反对杨绍萱同志的意见。我认为，如果用神话影射现实，势必破坏神话原来的美丽，同时也削弱了对现实生活的教育意义。这是一个
    “两败俱伤”的办法，既毁坏了神话，也降低了现实问题的严肃性。这样的做法，一方面表示作者缺少群众观点，一方面也表示了作者没有从爱国主义精神出发来尊重自己民族的神话创作，而轻轻地把神话糟塌了。北京师范大学　何逢
    劳动生产和阶级斗争才是艺术创造的源泉
    编辑同志：杨绍萱同志主张用神话影射现实，把现代人物和现代人物的思想意识改编到神话剧中去，我认为这是一种轻视劳动人民艺术才能的思想。他认为，在旧社会里，工人和农民“大都失掉了（应改为被剥夺了）文化教育的机会”，“自然就更谈不到多么高的文学艺术水平”。杨同志似乎并不明白一个极粗浅的常识，即艺术创造的源泉，是人民的劳动生产和阶级斗争。旧社会里的劳动人民虽然被剥夺了受文化教育的权利，可是他们的艺术创造的才能还是存在的。他们虽然不会写字、著书，但他们会舞蹈，会讲，会唱，因此产生了大量的优美的舞蹈、神话、传说、故事、民歌和民谣。爱惜民族的优美的艺术遗产，尊重古代劳动人民的艺术创造能力，是爱国主义的一种具体表现。
                天津大学附设工业学校　柳浩然
    反对对待批评的粗暴无理的态度
    编辑同志：我认为杨绍萱同志对待批评的态度是非常错误的，他缺少起码的自我批评精神。他把艾青同志对他的作品的批评看成是对他个人的“打击”，把自己的同志的正确意见，认为是“资敌”。并且说艾青同志“枪口对内，帮助敌人”，“打击了革命而便宜了敌人”。这种敌我不分、粗暴无理的态度，是一个革命文艺工作者所不应该有的。难道我们不应该开展文艺批评吗？为什么别人对自己的作品提出了一些批评，就表现出这种蛮横的态度呢？我完全同意马少波同志的意见：“事实证明：错误的不是别人，而恰恰是杨绍萱同志自己”
    （见人民日报十一月四日“严肃对待整理神话剧的工作”一文）。因此，应该彻底检讨的不是别人，而是杨绍萱同志！
            北京市总工会第十四区办事处　石明
    拒绝同志们的善意的批评是错误的
    编辑同志：我认为杨绍萱同志对待同志们善意的批评不仅不诚恳地接受，而且表现了很恶劣的态度，他专断地企图阻止批评。他在致人民日报的信上说：“艾青那篇文章发表之后，立时产生了一种恶果……总之，造成了干部中思想混乱。”这是真实的情况吗？难道在报刊上展开严肃的批评和自我批评是不好的吗？难道会产生什么“恶果”，造成什么“混乱”吗？即使批评的不正确，被批评者尽可以提出正确的意见来纠正它，怎么会造成“恶果”与“混乱”呢？如果批评是正确的，就应该老老实实地接受，积极地改正，更不会造成“恶果”与“混乱”。打击和企图阻止批评，对讨论问题和改正自己的错误，是没有丝毫好处的。
                中国煤业建筑器材公司　徐启文
    杨绍萱同志所谓“有正义感的人”是谁？
    编辑同志：我认为艾青同志的意见基本上是正确的，杨绍萱同志的立场、观点是有毛病的。杨绍萱同志用恶毒的谩骂攻击艾青同志，对批评和自我批评采取了粗暴、蛮横的态度。他甚至在给人民日报的第三封信上说：“有正义感的人虽知之而不敢说。看风行船的人那自然为它吹嘘。”这更是极端荒谬错误！请问杨绍萱同志，你所指的有正义感的人，是些什么人呢？看风行船的又是些什么人呢？在新民主主义的社会里，只有反革命分子才没有自由，没有发言权，而人民群众是有充分的言论出版自由的。难道杨绍萱同志认为今天还有什么人、什么东西压制着有正义感的人，以致“不敢说”吗？难道说坚持真理，同意别人正确的意见，就是看风行船、替人吹嘘吗？我认为杨绍萱同志的这种说法是对正确批评的一种无理的抗拒，也是对严肃的文艺思想斗争的诬蔑。
