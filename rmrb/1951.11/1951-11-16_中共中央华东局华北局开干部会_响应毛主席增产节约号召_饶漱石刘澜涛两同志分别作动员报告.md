Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 15th. The CPC Central Committee's East China Bureau, in response to Chairman Mao's call for increased production and practicing economy, convened a meeting of party member cadres from all directly affiliated organs on the 13th. At the meeting, Rao Shushi, Secretary of the CPC Central Committee's East China Bureau, delivered a report, calling on all party members and the People's Liberation Army in the East China region to respond to Chairman Mao's call with practical actions. He said that in order to implement increased production and practicing economy, we must oppose corruption and waste, and oppose bureaucracy. Rao Shushi pointed out that on the principle of not hindering work and affecting the health of staff, all organs must strictly implement the standards set by the central government and practice strict economy. The warehouses and materials of the organs should be thoroughly cleaned up and registered, and the production of the organs should be thoroughly inspected. In terms of the use of cars and housing, responsible cadres should, except for those who need to use special cars and special residences due to work needs and organizational decisions, implement the public car system and collective dormitory system. The overlapping and bloated institutions of various organs should be effectively reduced. All expenses must be in accordance with regulations, and all possible savings should be made.
Regarding the increase in production and practicing economy in various state-owned industrial and mining sectors, Rao Shushi said that each sector should give full play to the potential capacity of existing equipment, improve business management, improve product quality, eliminate waste, reduce costs, and increase national wealth.
Rao Shushi pointed out that this movement for increased production and practicing economy should be launched universally and deeply from top to bottom and from inside to outside. Not only should we make significant achievements in finance and economy, but also create a movement to change customs and habits in political and ideological style. Leading cadres at all levels should take leading organs at all levels (which is the focus of implementing political leadership) and the economic departments of various state-owned industrial and mining enterprises (which is the focus of implementing increased production and practicing economy) as the center of carrying out the movement; at the same time, they should carry out this movement to all aspects in a planned and step-by-step manner, making it a long-term mass movement. He said that our party is great, glorious, and correct, and the work of the party organizations in our East China region in all aspects is also successful under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. The vast majority of party members and cadres are hardworking, simple, and wholeheartedly fighting for the cause of the people. However, it is undeniable that there are still intolerable waste phenomena in some departments, extravagance and waste phenomena in some organs and individuals, and a small number of party members with bad qualities have been infected with the corrupt and degenerate style of landlords, bureaucrats, and compradors, resulting in serious corruption and even degeneration. He said that in order to implement Chairman Mao's instructions, all organs should be responsible by the heads, personally lead, and launch a mass movement against corruption, extravagance and waste, and bureaucracy in a prepared and guided manner without exception. This movement should be regarded as one of the main contents of this year's rectification campaign, and as one of the criteria for reviewing party members during party consolidation. Those who are found to be corrupt with conclusive evidence should be dealt with seriously; at the same time, those heroes, models, model Communist Party members, New Democratic Youth League members, and working cadres who are honest and devoted to their duties, safeguard the interests of the country and the people, and actively create wealth for the country and the people should be commended. Rao Shushi finally called on all organs, units, and industrial and mining sectors to propose goals for struggle based on different situations and possible conditions, and create a mass movement of streamlining, economizing, increasing production, and practicing economy.

This newspaper reports: The directly affiliated organs of the CPC Central Committee's North China Bureau held a general meeting of all staff on November 15th to respond to Chairman Mao's call for increased production and practicing economy. At the meeting, Liu Lantao, the Third Secretary of the CPC Central Committee's North China Bureau, called on all party member cadres and all staff to continue to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, fully support the Chinese People's Volunteers, implement streamlining and economy, and oppose extravagance and waste. He pointed out that streamlining and economy is a long-term political task of our party and the broad masses of the people, and all units should promote this movement based on specific circumstances. He further pointed out that serious waste phenomena have occurred in basic construction projects in various places. In the future, it must be handled in accordance with the regulations of the central government, repeated surveys must be carried out before construction begins, and strict inspection and supervision should be carried out after construction begins to prevent waste. All enterprises and institutions must immediately carry out the work of clearing up materials and verifying funds. Starting next year, the economic accounting system will be gradually implemented and strengthened. All levels of organs must conscientiously adhere to the system and practice strict economy. All working cadres must carry forward the glorious tradition of honesty, devotion to public service, and cherishing public property, oppose extravagance and waste phenomena, and severely punish corrupt elements. This winter's cadre rectification campaign in the entire region will focus on strengthening work and practicing economy. Encourage those cadres who wholeheartedly serve the people, cherish public property, and are honest and devoted to their duties; expose, criticize, and correct those extravagant and wasteful phenomena that are irresponsible to the country and the people; and punish and severely punish those corrupt and degenerate elements. In order to implement the spirit of streamlining and economy, Ping Jiesan, Secretary-General of the CPC Central Committee's North China Bureau, has already made a mobilization report at the general meeting of all staff. The streamlining and economy committee of the entire organ will be formally established soon. Party members and cadres of the entire organ are widely discussing and studying how to implement streamlining and economy in connection with their personal and work situations.

    响应毛主席增产节约号召
    饶漱石刘澜涛两同志分别作动员报告
    【新华社上海十五日电】中共中央华东局响应毛主席增产节约的号召，在十三日召开了各直属机关的党员干部大会。会上，中共中央华东局书记饶漱石作了报告，他号召华东区全体党员和人民解放军以实际行动来响应毛主席的号召。他说为了贯彻实行增产节约，我们要反对贪污浪费，反对官僚主义。饶漱石指出：在不妨害工作和影响工作人员健康的原则下，各机关必须严格执行中央规定的标准，厉行节约。机关的仓库物资，应该彻底清理和登记，机关的生产应该彻底进行检查。在使用汽车和房屋方面，负责干部除因工作需要和经组织决定得使用专车和专用住宅外，一律实行公车制和集体宿舍制。各机关重叠臃肿的机构应切实削减。一切开支，必须遵照规定，可省的全部节省。
    关于各国营工矿部门的增产节约，饶漱石说：各部门应充分发挥现有设备的潜在能力，改善经营管理，提高产品质量，消除浪费现象，降低成本，增加国家财富。
    饶漱石指出：这次增产节约运动，应从上而下，从内到外，普遍展开，深入进行。不但要在财政经济方面做出显著成绩，而且要在政治思想作风上成为移风易俗的运动。各级领导干部要把各级领导机关（这是贯彻政治领导的重点）和各国营工矿企业经济部门（这是贯彻增产节约的重点）作为开展运动的中心；同时要有计划有步骤地把这一运动贯彻到各方面去，使它成为长期的群众运动。他说：我们的党是伟大的、光荣的、正确的，我们华东地区党的组织在毛主席和党中央领导下，各方面的工作也是有成绩的。绝大多数的党员和干部都是艰苦朴素、全心全意为人民事业而奋斗的。但不可否认：在若干部门里还存在着不能容忍的浪费现象，若干机关和个人有铺张浪费现象，还有少数品质恶劣的党员，沾染了地主、官僚、买办的腐化堕落的作风，发生了严重的贪污行为甚至走向蜕化。他说：为了贯彻执行毛主席的指示，各机关都应无例外地由首长负责，亲自领导，有准备有领导地展开群众性的反贪污、反铺张浪费、反官僚主义的运动。这一运动应作为今年整风的主要内容之一，作为整党中审查党员的标准之一。对证据确凿的贪污腐化分子，应加以严肃处理；同时，对廉洁奉公、保卫国家人民利益及积极为国家和人民创造财富的英雄模范和模范的共产党员、新民主主义青年团员及工作干部应加以表扬。饶漱石最后号召各机关、各单位、各工矿部门根据不同的情况和可能的条件，提出奋斗的目标，造成群众性的精简节约和增产节约运动。
    【本报讯】中共中央华北局直属机关，为响应毛主席增产节约的号召，于十一月十五日举行全体工作人员大会。会上中共中央华北局第三书记刘澜涛，号召全体党员干部和一切工作人员，继续加强抗美援朝工作，全力支援中国人民志愿军，实行精简节约，反对铺张浪费。他指出精简节约是我们党和广大人民长期的政治任务，各单位应根据具体情况推行这一运动。他并进一步指出：各地基本建设工程曾产生严重浪费现象。今后必须按中央规定办理，动工前要反复勘察，动工后应严格检查监督，严防浪费。各企业单位，必须立即进行清理资材、核定资金的工作。明年起逐渐实行和加强经济核算制。各级机关要认真坚持制度，厉行节约。一切工作干部要发扬廉洁奉公、爱护公共财产的光荣传统，反对铺张浪费现象，严惩贪污分子。今年冬季全区干部整风，即以加强工作，厉行节约为中心内容。鼓励那些全心全意为人民服务、爱护公共财产、廉洁奉公的干部；揭发、批评和纠正那些对国家对人民不负责任的铺张浪费现象；处分和严惩那些贪污腐化分子。为了贯彻精简节约的精神，日前中共中央华北局平杰三秘书长，已在全机关人员大会上作了动员报告。全机关精简节约委员会即将正式成立。全机关党员干部正联系个人和工作，广泛讨论研究如何执行精简节约。
