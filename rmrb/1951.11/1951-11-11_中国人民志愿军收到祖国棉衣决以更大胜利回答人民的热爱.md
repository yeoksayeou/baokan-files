Dear people of the motherland, fellow clothing workers: In October, we received the cotton-padded clothing you made with your own hands, and everyone jumped for joy. The scientific and beautiful style of the clothing, the exquisite and delicate production techniques, and the excellent and durable quality of the materials left the comrades full of praise. When the soldiers put on the clothes, they found precious items such as needles, thread, cloth for repairing clothes, lice powder, triangular bandages, and letters of appreciation in the pockets, and were so moved that they couldn't speak for a moment. After a few seconds of silence, the soldiers all showed happy smiles and said in unison, "The people of the motherland treat us even better than our own parents," "Needles, thread... they are the heart of the people of the motherland!" Wearing the cotton-padded clothes, we seemed to see the people of the motherland carefully designing the style of the clothing, working beside the sewing machines, and writing letters of appreciation with full enthusiasm.

Compatriots, your love gives us great encouragement. The soldiers who are bravely fighting on the front lines are asking their superiors to give them more arduous tasks, "to repay the love of the people of the motherland with new victories." The comrades digging fortifications said, "We must build the fortifications well and strictly prevent all enemy sneak attacks and offensives!" The comrades who are participating in military training proposed: "We guarantee to learn our skills well and protect the happiness and safety of the people of the motherland."

Dear people of the motherland: In early October, we received the cotton-padded clothing sent by the motherland. The clothes are all very big, with a slim waist, and fit comfortably when worn; there are two ropes attached to the bottom of the trouser legs, which prevent wind from entering and make it convenient to run, ensuring that the American devils can't escape when we chase them. In addition, the pockets are all filled with first-aid kits, triangular bandages, lice powder, sewing kits, and cloth for repairing clothes. Dear people of the motherland, your hearts are truly reflecting our hearts! From the cotton-padded clothes you sent, I have once again received the love of the people of the motherland. I have made up my mind and am confident to repay the love of the people of the motherland with more and greater victories.

    中国人民志愿军收到祖国棉衣决以更大胜利回答人民的热爱
   亲爱的祖国人民、被服工人同志们：十月份，我们收到了你们亲手制作的棉衣，大家都高兴得跳起来。服装式样的科学美观、制作技术的精致细巧和材料质量的优美坚固，使得同志们赞不绝口。战士们把衣服穿在身上，发现袋子里装着针、线、补衣服的布、灭虱粉、三角巾、慰问信等珍贵的物品，感动得一时说不出话来。静静地过了几秒钟，战士们都露出了愉快的笑容。齐说：“祖国人民对待我们真比父母还亲”、“针、线……就是祖国人民的心啊！”我们穿上了棉衣，仿佛看见了祖国人民正在细心地设计着服装的式样，在缝纫机旁劳动着，在满怀热情地写着慰问信。
   同胞们，你们的热爱给予我们极大的鼓舞。正在火线上英勇作战的战士们，要求上级给予更艰巨的任务，“用新的胜利来回答祖国人民的热爱”。挖工事的同志们表示：“一定要把工事挖好，严防敌人的一切偷袭和进攻！”正在参加练兵的同志们提出：“保证学好本领，保卫祖国人民的幸福和安全。”　中国人民志愿军某部全体指战员
   亲爱的祖国人民：十月初，我们领到了由祖国送来的棉衣。棉衣都很大，腰里瘦瘦的，穿上又合身又舒适；裤腿下面附有两条绳子，吹不进风，跑起路来又便利，保证追击美国鬼子时让他跑不掉。另外，袋子里都装有救急包、三角巾、灭虱粉、针线包和补衣服的布。亲爱的祖国人民，你们的心正印着我们的心啊！从你们送来的棉衣上，我又一次领受了祖国人民的爱。我已经下定决心，而且也有信心用更多更大的胜利来回答祖国人民的热爱。
