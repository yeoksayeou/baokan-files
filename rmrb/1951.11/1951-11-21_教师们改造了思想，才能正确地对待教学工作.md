Teachers in Beijing and Tianjin's institutions of higher education are currently engaged in a study movement to transform their thinking through criticism and self-criticism. We are very willing to help teachers do a good job in this study.

We believe that many incorrect ideologies exist among our teachers: some teachers still hold purely professional viewpoints, and therefore often fail to conduct ideological education for students in their teaching. In our schools, one teacher uses lowering students' scores to elevate his own status. He often deliberately fails more than one-third of the students in the class to show how profound his knowledge is. Some teachers teach simply to complete tasks. Some teachers have too many part-time jobs outside of school, and regard teaching as their "side job." They do not take the people's education cause seriously in their minds at all. They do not prepare adequately before class, and when they teach, they either read directly from the textbook or list phenomena. After class, they also have no time to understand the students' learning situation. This "side job viewpoint" is an irresponsible performance towards the people.

In response to the above phenomena, I would like to offer the following suggestions to teachers:

First, teachers in institutions of higher education should not teach for personal reputation, status, or interests, but should first think of the needs of the motherland, the needs of the people, and teach for the purpose of cultivating useful construction talents for the motherland.

Second, correctly grasp the thought of Marxism-Leninism, that is, grasp the proletariat's position, viewpoint, and method, and apply historical materialism and dialectical materialism to teaching work.

Third, establish an honest and solid teaching attitude. Do not teach simply to complete tasks, and do not mystify teaching. You should do everything possible to teach students to understand.

    教师们改造了思想，才能正确地对待教学工作
    北京、天津两地的高等学校教师正在运用批评与自我批评的方式，展开改造思想的学习运动。我们很愿意帮助教师们把这一学习工作搞好。
    我们觉得，我们的教师中所存在的不正确的思想意识很多：部分的教师还有着纯业务的观点，因此在教学中往往不能对学生进行思想上的教育。在我们学校中，有一位先生用压低同学的分数来自抬身价。他常常有意地使全班三分之一以上的同学不及格，以表示自己学问的高深。有些教师用单纯完成任务的方法来进行教学。有些教师在学校外面兼职太多，把教课看做自己的“副业”，根本没有从思想上重视人民的教育事业，课前不作充分准备，上课时不是照本宣读，就是罗列现象，下课后也无暇去了解同学们的学习情况。这种“副业观点”是对人民不负责任的表现。
    针对上述的种种现象，我愿向教师们提供几点意见：
    第一、高等学校的教师不应为个人的名誉、地位、利益而教学，应该首先想到祖国的需要，人民的需要，为培养祖国有用的建设人材而教学。
    第二、正确地掌握马克思列宁主义的思想，即掌握无产阶级的立场、观点、方法，把历史唯物主义和辩证唯物主义运用到教学工作中去。
    第三、建立老老实实的教学态度，不要单纯为完成任务而教学，也不要在教学上故弄玄虚，应尽一切力量把学生教懂。　魏翀
