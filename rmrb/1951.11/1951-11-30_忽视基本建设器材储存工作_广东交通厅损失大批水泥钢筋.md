Ignoring Basic Construction Material Storage Work
Guangdong Transportation Department Loses Large Quantities of Cement and Steel Reinforcement

Leading cadres of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government Transportation Department did not value the storage of basic construction materials, resulting in the loss of large quantities of cement and steel reinforcement. According to an investigation by the Guangdong Provincial People's Government Supervisory Committee and other relevant departments, the department purchased a large quantity of cement in December of last year due to project needs. Due to improper storage, 1,285 tons of cement were damaged by rain and hardened. Among them, 400 tons hardened into small grains and could still be used, but the remaining 885 tons hardened into large blocks and could not be used, resulting in a loss of approximately 1.23 billion RMB. In addition, some of the steel reinforcement purchased by the department did not meet specifications and could not be used; most of the steel reinforcement was stored outdoors and had oxidized and rusted, reducing its performance.

After the department purchased the cement last year, it was stored in Dakengkou in Beijiang, Guangzhou, and Conghua. Before the cement was transported to Dakengkou, Lin Ping, director of the Guangdong Provincial Highway Construction Committee, instructed: "Prepare warehouses and transportation workers in advance." The Beijiang Branch of the Guangdong Provincial Highway Construction Committee also suggested to the department that the houses near Dakengkou should be repaired before cement could be stored. On January 4th of this year, the Beijiang Branch telegraphed the department, reporting that there was too much cement and storage was difficult, requesting funds to build sheds. However, Li Mu, director of the Management Office of the department, neither implemented the instructions of his superiors nor studied the opinions put forward by his subordinates, and blindly transported the cement to Dakengkou. Ren Zhonglin, chief of the Management Section of the department, was specifically responsible for the handling of cement and steel reinforcement. When the Beijiang Branch requested a delay in transportation because there was no place to store the cement, Ren Zhonglin agreed not to transport it, but did not report it to his superiors and continued to transport it. As a result, more than one-third of the cement transported to Dakengkou had to be stored outdoors, was exposed to rain, and suffered serious losses. Ma Da, the county magistrate of Conghua County and director of the Conghua Branch of the Guangdong Provincial Construction Committee, did not pay attention to storage. The technical instructions for storing cement, forwarded by the Beijiang Branch for the cement transported to Conghua, were set aside by Ma Da and not distributed, so that the storage personnel did not understand the storage methods and watched the cement being rained on. The department also failed to inspect and supervise this situation. The derelict personnel will be punished according to the severity of their circumstances.

### 忽视基本建设器材储存工作  广东交通厅损失大批水泥钢筋

    忽视基本建设器材储存工作
    广东交通厅损失大批水泥钢筋
    广东省人民政府交通厅领导干部不重视基本建设器材的储存工作，使大量水泥钢筋遭受损失。据广东省人民政府人民监察委员会与其他有关部门的调查，该厅去年十二月因工程需要，购进大批水泥，由于保管不善，以致有一千二百八十五吨水泥遭雨淋硬化。其中除四百吨硬化成小粒尚能使用外，其余八百八十五吨均硬化成大块，已不能使用，损失约值人民币十二亿三千多万元。另外，该厅购进的钢筋有一部分不合规格，无法使用；大部钢筋因露天存放，已氧化生锈，性能减低。
    去年该厅购进水泥后，即分存于广州北江大坑口和从化两地。水泥尚未运往大坑口以前，广东省公路修筑委员会主任林平就曾指示：“要事前准备好仓库和运工。”广东省公路修筑委员会北江分会亦曾向该厅建议，将大坑口附近房屋修缮后，始能存放水泥。今年一月四日北江分会又电该厅，报告水泥过多，贮存困难，要求拨款搭盖席棚。但该厅经理处处长李牧，既没有执行上级指示，也没有研究下级提出的意见，就盲目地将水泥运至大坑口。该厅经理科科长任仲林，具体负责水泥、钢筋的处理工作，当北江分会因水泥无处存放请求缓运时，任仲林答应不运，但未报告上级，继续运去。结果运到大坑口的水泥有三分之一以上不得不露天存放，遭雨淋湿，造成严重损失。从化县县长兼广东省修筑委员会从化支会主任马达，不注意保管。运到从化的水泥，北江分会转发下的保管水泥技术指示，被马达搁置起来未发下去，以致保管人员不懂保管方法，坐视水泥被雨淋湿。该厅对此种情况也没有检查督促。失职人员将按情节轻重分别受到处分。
