	Inspecting the Implementation of the Marriage Law by Basic-Level Organizations of the Communist Youth League

	Should Communist Youth League members be models for resisting the feudal marriage system, or should they be "models" for obeying the feudal marriage system? The question raised by Dong Guiying, a female Communist Youth League member in the suburbs of Beijing, deserves the attention of leadership organs at all levels, especially the Communist Youth League committees at all levels. This is not because the question itself still needs discussion, but because the Communist Youth League branch in Dong Guiying's village is actually protecting the feudal marriage system, and is wrongly guiding or even forcing its members to obey this system, to the point of compelling Dong Guiying to loudly appeal and raise such a question.

	Dong Guiying's parents forced Dong Guiying to marry Du Wenqing, a stranger, which is an act of infringing on human rights. Dong Guiying's experience is so unfortunate that the entire sympathy of the Communist Youth League branch should obviously be concentrated on Dong Guiying's side. However, under the leadership of branch secretary Yu Dejiang, the village's Communist Youth League branch took the opposite stance and suppressed Dong Guiying (the branch called this suppression "education"). Their reasons were: first, Du Wenqing's family "has food and drink and doesn't beat or scold." Second, if Communist Youth League members divorce, it will have a "bad influence" on the masses. According to the former reason, it seems that marriage should not be conditional on "complete willingness of both parties" (Article 3 of the Marriage Law), but should be conditional on the man's family "having food and drink" or simply "not beating or scolding." According to the latter reason, it seems that Communist Youth League members should obediently obey their parents' arranged marriages, obey the opinions of some backward masses, and should not strive for freedom of marriage.

	This kind of thinking and behavior that violates the Marriage Law not only exists in the Communist Youth League branch in that village, but also exists in many other Communist Youth League branches. They do not actively support and lead the struggle of young men and women (especially women) to fight for freedom of marriage, but instead use completely wrong measures such as "expulsion from the League," "holding criticism and struggle meetings" to attack and suppress them. This situation must be changed. Communist Youth League organizations at all levels must firmly implement the relevant provisions in the Communist Youth League's "Work Program," and warmly provide various forms of support to all young men and women who are struggling for freedom of marriage. If they encounter difficulties, they should help them overcome them; if they are persecuted, they should take concrete and effective measures to conscientiously protect their safety, and through the judicial organs of the People's Government, give legal sanctions to those who interfere with the youth's freedom of marriage. Communist Youth League organizations at all levels should work together to protect the youth's freedom of marriage and to implement the Marriage Law!

    检查青年团基层组织对婚姻法的执行状况
    青年团员应该成为反抗封建婚姻制度的模范，还是应该成为服从封建婚姻制度的“模范”呢？北京市郊区女青年团员董桂英提出的这一问题，值得各地领导机关尤其是各地青年团团委的注意。这并不是因为这一问题本身还需要讨论，而是因为董桂英所在村的青年团的支部实际上在保护着封建的婚姻制度，并且在错误地引导甚至强制自己的团员服从这种制度，以至迫使董桂英不得不大声疾呼，提出这样的问题。
    董桂英的父母强制董桂英和一个陌生的男子杜文清结婚，这是一种侵犯人权的行为。董桂英的遭遇是如此不幸，青年团支部的全部同情，显然应该集中在董桂英这一边。但是，村的青年团支部却在支部书记于德江领导下站到了相反的立场上，对董桂英实行压制（支部把这种压制称为“教育”）。他们的理由，一是杜文清家“有吃有喝，不打不骂”。二是青年团员要离婚就会对群众“影响不好”。根据前一理由，似乎婚姻就不应该以“本人完全自愿”（婚姻法第三条）为条件，而应该以男家“有吃有喝”或仅仅“不打不骂”为条件了。根据后一理由，似乎青年团员就应该俯首贴耳地服从父母包办的婚姻，服从某些落后群众的意见，而不应该去争取婚姻自由了。
    这种违反婚姻法的思想与言行，不但在该村青年团支部存在着，而且在其他许多青年团支部存在着。它们对于青年男女（尤其是妇女）争取婚姻自由的斗争，不是积极地予以支持和领导，而是以“开除团籍”、“开会批评、斗争”等完全错误的措施加以打击和压制。这种情形是必须改变的。各地青年团的组织，必须坚定地执行青年团“工作纲领”中的有关规定，对于一切为争取婚姻自由而斗争的青年男女，热情地给以各种形式的支援。如果他们遭遇了困难，就应该帮助他们加以排除；如果他们受到了迫害，就应该采取具体有效的措施，切实负责地保护他们的安全，并经过人民政府的司法机关，给干涉青年婚姻自由的分子以法律制裁。各地青年团的组织，应一致努力为保护青年的婚姻自由，为贯彻执行婚姻法而斗争！
