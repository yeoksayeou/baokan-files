Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 23rd: TASS reported from Moscow on November 23rd: On November 21st, the Soviet government, regarding the proposal made by the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and Turkey to establish the so-called Joint Middle East Command, formally sent a note to the Egyptian government concerning the joint "defense" of the Middle East and the Near East. On the same day, the Soviet government sent similar notes to the governments of Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Israel.

The Soviet government's note to the Egyptian government stated: On October 14th, the press published the proposal formally submitted to the Egyptian government by the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and Turkey concerning the establishment of the so-called Joint Middle East Command for the purpose of jointly "defending" the Middle East and the Near East. This proposal was also sent to the governments of Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Israel, and Transjordan. On November 10th, the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and Turkey issued another statement to the governments of the aforementioned countries on the same issue. The above-mentioned proposals stipulate the establishment of a "Joint Middle East Command," with foreign armed forces stationed in Egypt and other countries in the Near East and the Middle East. The headquarters of this command will be located in Egyptian territory, and Egypt and other countries in the region will hand over their armed forces, military bases, transportation, ports, and other facilities for the use of the command. The proposal also stipulates that the so-called Middle East Command will be linked to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

The note continued: It can be seen from these proposals and the four-nation statement that the establishment of the so-called joint command is to allow countries in the Near East and the Middle East to participate in the war measures implemented by the North Atlantic bloc under the pretext of organizing "defense." The various measures that the organizers of the North Atlantic bloc, led by the United States, are implementing in Europe and other regions show that this bloc is an instrument of imperialist aggression policies. This alone already illustrates that the four-nation proposal to establish the Middle East Joint Command has nothing to do with maintaining peace and security in the Near East and the Middle East, and is also completely unrelated to the national interests of the countries in the region. The establishment of such a military command is related to a series of broad plans to establish new bases in Egypt, Iraq, and other countries in the Near East and the Middle East, expand existing bases, extend the period of foreign troops' stay in these countries, and send additional foreign troops to their territories. If this plan is realized, it will lead to the actual occupation of the Near East and the Middle East by the troops of the North Atlantic bloc countries, led by the United States and Britain. These countries will therefore lose their independence and sovereignty and be enslaved by certain major powers that attempt to use the territories and resources of the Near East and the Middle East to achieve their aggressive aims.

The note exposed that the Western countries' often-mentioned "defense interests" of the Near East and Middle East countries are merely used to cover up their anti-Soviet and anti-people's democracy aggression war preparation measures in the region, and solemnly pointed out: Since its establishment, the Soviet Union has paid attention to the national aspirations of the people of the East and their struggle for national independence and sovereignty with understanding and sympathy. Contrary to the situation in which some countries treat the Near East and the Middle East as their colonies, the consistent policy of the Soviet government is to support the just national demands of the people of all nations, regardless of their size. This Soviet policy not only conforms to the fundamental national interests of the people of the Near East and the Middle East, but also contributes to the maintenance of world peace. The Soviet government has consistently pursued a policy of peace, and it has constantly put forward concrete proposals in the United Nations to consolidate peace and security in the past and present. All this shows how absurd is the claim that the Near East and the Middle East countries are threatened in some way.

The note concluded: The Soviet government fully agrees with the attitude currently adopted by the Egyptian government towards the above-mentioned four-nation proposal, and believes that it is necessary to draw the Egyptian government's attention to the fact that if the Near East and Middle East countries participate in the so-called Middle East Joint Command, it will seriously damage the current relations between the Soviet Union and these countries, and will seriously undermine the cause of maintaining peace and security in the Near East and Middle East region.

The Soviet government's note was also sent on November 22nd by the Soviet Minister to Egypt to the envoys of Saudi Arabia and Yemen stationed in Egypt, for them to forward to their respective governments.

    关于美、英、法、土建立“中东司令部”问题
    苏联照会埃及叙利亚等国家政府
    揭露美英侵略集团奴役中近东各国企图
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十三日讯：十一月二十一日，苏联政府就美、英、法、土耳其四国政府提出的建立所谓中东联合司令部的建议，照会埃及政府。苏联政府同一天并以同样的照会送交叙利亚、黎巴嫩、伊拉克、以色列四国政府。
    苏联政府给埃及政府的照会说：十月十四日，报上发表了美、英、法、土四国政府就建立所谓中东联合司令部以进行中东和近东的共同“防务”问题正式向埃及政府提出的建议。这个建议还送交叙利亚、黎巴嫩、伊拉克、沙特阿拉伯、也门、以色列和外约旦各国政府。十一月十日、美、英，法、土四国政府又发表了给上述各国政府的关于同一问题的声明。上述建议规定：成立“中东联合司令部”，外国武装部队驻扎在埃及和近东、中东的其他国家的领土上，这个司令部设在埃及领土上，埃及和这个区域的其他各国把它们的武装部队、军事基地、交通工具、港口及其他设备交给该司令部使用。建议并规定：所谓中东司令部将和北大西洋公约组织联系。
    照会接着说：从这些建议和四国声明中可以看出：设立所谓联合司令部，是为了让近东和中东地区各国参与北大西洋集团在组织“防务”的借口下所实施的战争措施。以美国为首的北大西洋集团的组织者在欧洲和其他地区正在实行的各项措施，表明这个集团是帝国主义侵略政策的工具。单是这一点，就已经说明四国建议的建立中东联合司令部的计划是和维持近东和中东的和平与安全毫不相干的，与该地区各国的民族利益也是毫不相干的。这种军事司令部的成立和一些广泛的计划有关，这些计划是要在埃及、伊拉克和近东、中东其他国家建立新的基地，扩充现有基地，延长外国军队在这些国家驻扎的时期，并增派外国军队到它们的领土上去。如果实现了这个计划，就会使近东和中东各国实际上被以美英为首的北大西洋集团国家的军队所占领。这些国家将因此而丧失独立和主权，并遭受某些大国的奴役，这些大国企图利用近东和中东国家的领土和资源来达到它们的侵略目的。
    照会揭露西方国家常提的关于什么近东和中东国家的“防务利益”的说法只是用来掩饰它们在该地区的反苏、反人民民主国家的侵略战争准备措施，并郑重指出：苏联自立国以来就怀着了解和同情注意东方各族人民的民族愿望和他们争取民族独立和主权的斗争。和某些国家把近东和中东国家当作自己的殖民地的情况相反，苏联政府一贯的政策是支持不论大小民族的人民的正义的民族要求。苏联这种政策不仅符合近东和中东各族人民的基本民族利益，而且也有利于维持世界和平。苏联政府一贯奉行和平政策，它过去和现在都曾不断地在联合国中提出巩固和平与安全的具体建议。这一切表明，所谓近东和中东国家遭到某种威胁的说法是多么荒谬。
    照会最后说：苏联政府完全赞同埃及政府目前对上述四国建议所采取的态度，并认为必须提请埃及政府注意：如果近东和中东各国参加了所谓中东联合司令部，那就会严重地损害苏联和这些国家间目前的关系，而且会严重地损害维持近东和中东地区和平与安全的事业。
    苏联政府的这个照会，并在十一月二十二日由苏联驻埃及公使分别致送沙特阿拉伯和也门的驻埃及使节，由他们转交两国政府。
