    Beijing Municipal People's Government Bureau of Public Health Engineering and Construction Bureau
    General Inspection of Subordinate Capital Construction Work
    In order to overcome the phenomenon of waste in municipal construction, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Bureau of Public Health Engineering and the Construction Bureau conducted inspections of all municipal construction projects undertaken by their respective bureaus from July to September this year, thoroughly uncovering shortcomings in their work. The staff of both bureaus strengthened their thinking of "serving the people wholeheartedly" and "cherishing state property" through this inspection, laying a good foundation for increasing production and practicing economy, and improving work in the future.
    Since the liberation of Beijing, under the leadership of the Municipal People's Government, the Bureau of Public Health Engineering and the Construction Bureau have correctly implemented the municipal construction policy of "serving the capital, serving production, and serving the working people," and vigorously carried out capital construction projects such as repairing and building new sewers and roads. All twenty-two systems of old sewers in the city (with a total length of 210 kilometers) have been unblocked after repairs last year and this year. In the past two years, a total of 54 kilometers of new sewers have been built and 24 kilometers of open ditches have been dredged in areas where working people live. The forty-eight areas in the city that used to be most severely flooded no longer flooded after rain this year, and the places with the slowest drainage were passable for pedestrians and vehicles within twenty minutes after the rain stopped. In terms of road construction: from January to September this year alone, the area of newly built roads was more than twice the total area of roads built by the Kuomintang reactionary government in the three years before liberation. Most of these roads were built in the outer city where working people live and in areas that are essential for the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. In addition, the Bureau of Public Health Engineering has also made great achievements in dredging rivers and lakes, repairing public toilets and sewage pools; the Construction Bureau has also carried out some construction work in bridges, culverts, gardens, and other areas.
    These achievements are the result of the hard work of all staff members of the two bureaus under the correct leadership of the Municipal People's Government and with the active assistance of the broad masses of citizens. This year, the Municipal People's Government allocated 58 percent of the total budget for undertakings to municipal construction. Most of the budget twice added by the Municipal Government was also used for municipal construction. Mayor Peng Zhen often educated and urged all staff members to implement the policy of "spending less money and doing more things" and "popularizing first and then improving"; solving many practical problems in the lives of the broad masses of citizens, and deepening the love and support of the citizens for the government.
    However, there are still many shortcomings that must be overcome in the various construction projects undertaken by these two bureaus. Some projects were not sufficiently investigated and studied during the design stage, resulting in impracticality; during construction, due to a purely task-oriented perspective, emphasis was placed on quantity rather than quality; some projects were designed and constructed simultaneously; some staff members were perfunctory, only caring about appearances, being careless, and lacking a responsible attitude towards the people; these shortcomings caused serious losses of state property. From this inspection, the majority of staff members recognized their shortcomings and criticized the erroneous thinking of emphasizing objective difficulties in the past. Now, both bureaus have formulated specific plans to improve their work, and are preparing to continue to carry out the study of "construction is impossible without correct engineering design" among all staff members, to further understand the far-reaching political significance of capital construction, and to better build the people's capital.

    北京市人民政府卫生工程局和建设局
    普遍检查所属基本建设工作
    北京市人民政府卫生工程局和建设局，为了克服市政建设中的浪费现象，在今年七月到九月，分别检查了各该局主办的全部市政建设工程，深入发掘了工作中的缺点。两个局的工作人员都从这次检查中加强了“全心全意为人民服务”和“爱护国家财物”的思想，为今后增产节约，改进工作，打下了良好的基础。
    北京解放以来，卫生工程局和建设局在市人民政府领导下，正确执行了“为首都，为生产，为劳动人民服务”的市政建设方针，大力进行整修、新建下水道和道路等基本建设工程。全市二十二个系统的旧下水道（共长二百一十公里），经过去年和今年的整修，已全部畅通。两年来，在劳动人民聚居的地区，共修建了新下水道五十四公里，疏浚明沟二十四公里。过去全城四十八处积水最严重的地区，今年雨后已不再积水，排水最慢的地方，也在雨停后二十分钟内就可行人通车。道路工程方面：仅仅今年一月到九月，新修道路的面积，比解放前三年内国民党反动政府所修道路的总面积多两倍余。这些道路大部分修在劳动人民聚居的外城和城乡物资交流必经的地区。此外，卫生工程局在疏浚河湖、整修公厕和秽水池方面，也有很大的成绩；建设局在桥涵、园林等方面也进行了一些建设工作。
    这些成绩，是两局全体工作人员，在市人民政府正确领导，和广大市民积极协助下，努力工作的结果。今年，市人民政府拨了全部事业费预算的百分之五十八，进行市政建设。市政府两次追加的预算，大部也用在市政建设方面。彭真市长并经常教育、督促全体工作人员，贯彻执行“少花钱、多办事”“先普及、后提高”的方针；替广大市民解决了实际生活中的很多问题，加深了市民对政府的热爱和拥护。
    但是，这两个局主办的各项建设工作，还有很多必须克服的缺点。有些工程在设计时没有充分调查研究，以致不切实际；施工时又由于单纯任务观点，重量不重质；有些工程，一面设计，一面施工；有些工作人员敷衍塞责，只图表面，粗枝大叶，缺乏对人民负责的工作态度；这些缺点，造成了浪费国家财物的严重损失。从这次检查中，大多数工作人员认识了自己的缺点，批判了过去强调客观困难的错误思想。现在，这两个局都制订了改进工作的具体计划，并准备在全体工作人员中，继续展开“没有正确的工程设计就不可能施工”的学习，进一步认识基本建设的远大政治意义，更好地建设人民的首都。
