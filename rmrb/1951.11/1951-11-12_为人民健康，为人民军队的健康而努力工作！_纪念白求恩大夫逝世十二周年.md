Editor's Note: This year, November 12th, marks the twelfth anniversary of the death of international friend Comrade Bethune. Comrade Bethune, dispatched by the Canadian and American Communist Parties, arrived in Yan'an in April 1938 and went to the anti-Japanese front in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region in June of the same year. In the extremely difficult environment of rural guerrilla warfare with limited medical equipment and technical conditions, he personally founded the Model International Peace Hospital (now the Bethune International Peace Hospital) and the Bethune Medical School (later the North China Medical University). With absolutely no selfish motives, he regarded the cause of the Chinese people's liberation as his own, personally going to the front lines to treat a large number of wounded soldiers. Under the influence of his education and exemplary actions, he trained a large number of medical workers. In the eighteen months of his work, he made indelible contributions to the Chinese people. After Dr. Bethune's death, a fervent movement to learn from Dr. Bethune was launched in the People's Liberation Army and various liberated areas, achieving great success.

Today, as our people's great revolution has achieved glorious victory and our people's movement to resist America and aid Korea is vigorously developing, it is of extremely significant importance for us to commemorate Dr. Bethune and learn from and promote his spirit of internationalism.

In order to commemorate this great international friend, we are now publishing an article by Comrade Ye Qingshan. Comrade Ye Qingshan was formerly the Minister of Health of the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region and is currently the Deputy Minister of Health of the North China Military Region. He worked with Dr. Bethune for eighteen months.

November 12th this year marks the twelfth anniversary of the death of our beloved international friend—the great Dr. Bethune.

I worked with Dr. Bethune for eighteen months. After those eighteen months, he sacrificed himself for the cause of the Chinese people's liberation on the front lines of the War of Resistance Against Japan—the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region. He demonstrated a high degree of responsibility and a pragmatic approach in his work. No matter the time, no matter how big or small the matter, as long as the wounded and sick needed it, as long as it was beneficial to the wounded and sick, he would complete it without any hardship; and he patiently educated us with his superb skills and rich experience, improving our health and medical work, so that our health and medical work at that time was rapidly improved and elevated. This noble spirit of internationalism and revolutionary humanitarianism is a great example for our Chinese medical and health workers, and it is worthy of our eternal commemoration and study.

Since our entire nation launched the great and vigorous movement to resist America, aid Korea, defend our country's security, and protect world peace, medical and health workers across the country have also actively joined the patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea. They have responded to the call of the General Association to Resist America and Aid Korea, organizing volunteer surgical teams and epidemic prevention teams, leaving their homes and comfortable hospitals and schools, donning the uniforms of the volunteers, and rushing to the Korean battlefield. On the Korean front lines, they are not afraid of difficulties or sacrifices, and they are actively supporting the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. This is a concrete manifestation of the patriotism and internationalism of medical and health workers across the country, and it is the implementation by our national medical and health workers of what Chairman Mao taught us: learn the internationalist spirit of Dr. Bethune. Chairman Mao said: "What kind of spirit is it for a foreigner, with absolutely no selfish motives, to regard the cause of the Chinese people's liberation as his own? This is the spirit of internationalism, the spirit of communism. Every Chinese Communist Party member must learn this spirit from him." Therefore, we must regard the cause of the Korean people's liberation as our own. This is the supreme glory of the medical and health workers of the People's China. We must cherish it and promote it. Therefore, we must not be arrogant or complacent, we must not be scattered or slack, but we must more universally and deeply receive practical education in the spirit of internationalism in the movement to resist America and aid Korea.

Comrades on the front lines of resisting America and aiding Korea must better temper themselves in the war, obey all the demands of the war, and obey all the needs of the wounded and sick. Dr. Bethune said: "Even if you don't go to the front line to rescue, you should at least meet the wounded on the way." This means understanding that on the front lines, you must strive to perform surgery one minute earlier, and strive to rescue every wounded soldier—this increases the active forces of resisting America and aiding Korea. Comrades working in the rear must actively participate in the movement to increase production, practice economy, and donate weapons, earnestly establish patriotic covenants, and redouble their work efficiency. For the needs of the motherland, continue to prepare to organize more volunteer surgical teams and epidemic prevention teams to support the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and strive for the victory of the anti-aggression war of the Chinese and Korean people, and vow not to rest until the goal is achieved. In this way, with the front and the rear having one heart, one direction, and one goal, and uniting together, our strength will be infinite, and any difficulty can be overcome.

With the development of the movement to resist America and aid Korea, a considerable number of medical and health workers have enthusiastically responded to the government's call and actively participated in the health construction of the national defense army. Serving the health of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the defenders of the motherland. Because they know that in the People's China, it is most glorious to serve the health of one's own army. Therefore, after they go to work in the army, they do not think that the army's life is hard and the working conditions are poor, which will lower their status as "formal university graduates" or "highly skilled" individuals, and they do not haggle over personal gains and losses; on the contrary, they earnestly carry out self-education and self-transformation, and therefore, they work with peace of mind and actively dedicate their knowledge and skills to relieve the suffering of the wounded and sick and improve the technical level of the troops. Because of this, their own technical and political awareness has also been rapidly improved. They quickly live and work together with the wounded and sick and the comrades in the army, learning from and respecting each other. Precisely because of this, on the one hand, the comrades working in the army have been helped by them and have improved their skills, and on the other hand, they have become accustomed to the life in the army and the pragmatic style, and they feel even more glorious to serve the people wholeheartedly, and they demand to be the same as the comrades in the army. As one expert doctor said: "During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, I would not go even if they invited me by plane. Today, I feel the most glorious to wear the uniform of the People's Army." This is the actual manifestation of the people loving their own army and loving their own motherland. This is what Dr. Bethune said: "We must use technology for the happiness and prosperity of millions and millions of people, not to enrich a few people." If some people have technology but only care about personal gains and losses, and do not use it to serve the people's health and serve the health of their own army, then they are failing the people's education and hope for them. We should patiently educate and help them in all aspects. Only in this way can we align our steps, ensure that the health construction of the national defense army continues to receive support from the national medical community, and more rapidly carry out the health construction of the national defense army, so that the health of the commanders and fighters of the People's Army is fully guaranteed.

Medical and health workers! Our motherland's most dangerous enemy—the American imperialists—are not reconciled to their failure on the Korean battlefield and are intensifying the rearmament of Japan, constantly threatening the security of our motherland, as well as threatening peace in the Far East and the world. Chairman Mao clearly instructed us in the opening speech of the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "In order to continue to persist in this necessary and just struggle, we need to continue to strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, and we need to increase production and practice strict economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers. This is the central task of the Chinese people today." Therefore, we must better promote and learn the internationalist spirit of Dr. Bethune; we must earnestly study and apply in our practical work the most advanced Soviet medical experience and military medical experience; only in this way can we make better and greater achievements in the struggle to resist America and aid Korea and on the Korean battlefield. This is the practical significance of our commemoration of the twelfth anniversary of Dr. Bethune's death. Let us unite more closely together, under the banner of Mao Zedong, and strive forward for the health of the people of the motherland and for the health of the People's Army! (Attached picture)

    为人民健康，为人民军队的健康而努力工作！
    ——纪念白求恩大夫逝世十二周年
  　叶青山
    编者按：今年十一月十二日为国际友人白求恩同志逝世十二周年纪念日，白求恩同志，受加拿大与美国共产党的派遣，于一九三八年四月到达延安，同年六月赴晋察冀边区抗日前线，在医疗设备与技术条件极度困难的农村游击战争环境中，手创模范国际和平医院（即现在的白求恩国际和平医院）与白求恩医科学校（即后来的华北医科大学）。他以毫无利己的动机，把中国人民解放事业，当作他自己的事业，亲临前线救治了大批伤员。在他的教育和模范行动影响下，培养了大批的医疗工作者。在十八个月的工作中，为中国人民树立了不可磨灭的功绩。白求恩大夫逝世以后，在人民解放军和各个解放区，都曾掀起了热烈地学习白求恩大夫的运动，获得了很大的成绩。
    当我国人民大革命已获得了光辉的胜利、我国人民抗美援朝爱国运动蓬勃开展的今天，我们来纪念白求恩大夫、学习与发扬他这种国际主义的精神，更有极其重大的意义。
    为了纪念这位伟大的国际友人，我们现在发表叶青山同志的一篇文章。叶青山同志原为晋察冀军区卫生部部长，现任华北军区卫生部副部长，曾和白求恩大夫共同工作了十八个月。
    今年十一月十二日，是我们亲爱的国际友人——伟大的白求恩大夫逝世十二周年纪念日。
    我同白求恩大夫一起工作了十八个月。十八个月后，他就为了中国人民的解放事业而牺牲在当时的抗日战争最前线——晋察冀边区。他在工作中表现了高度负责精神和实事求是的作风。他不管什么时候，不管大小事情，只要伤病员需要，只要对伤病员有利，他就不辞一切辛苦去完成它；并耐心地把自己的高明技术和丰富经验教育我们，改进我们的卫生医疗工作，使我们当时卫生医疗工作迅速地得到改进和提高。这样崇高的国际主义和革命人道主义的精神，是我们中国人民的医药卫生工作者的伟大榜样，值得我们永远纪念和学习的。
    自从我们全国人民为反对美国侵略、保卫祖国安全和世界和平而发起了伟大的轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝保家卫国运动以来，全国医药卫生工作者也积极地投入抗美援朝的爱国运动中。纷纷响应抗美援朝总会的号召，组织志愿手术队、防疫队，离开家乡，走出安适的医院、学校，穿上志愿军的戎装，奔赴朝鲜战场。他们在朝鲜前线，不怕困难，不怕牺牲，积极地支援着朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军。这是全国医药卫生工作者爱国主义和国际主义精神的具体表现，也就是我全国人民医药卫生工作者执行了毛主席所教导我们的：学习白求恩大夫国际主义精神。毛主席说：“一个外国人，毫无利己的动机，把中国人民的解放事业，当作他自己的事业，这是什么精神？这是国际主义的精神，这是共产主义的精神，中国共产党员每个都要学习他这种精神。”所以，我们要把朝鲜人民的解放事业当作我们自己的事业。这是人民中国的医药卫生工作者无上的光荣。我们要珍惜它，发扬它。因此，我们丝毫不能骄傲自满，不能散漫松懈，而要更普遍地更深入地在抗美援朝运动中得到国际主义精神的实际教育。
    在抗美援朝最前线的同志们，要在战争中更好地锻炼自己，一切服从战争的要求，一切服从伤病员的需要。白求恩大夫说：“纵然不到前线救护，至少应在途中迎接伤员。”这就是说要懂得：在前方要争取早一分钟施行手术，要争取抢救每一个伤员——就是增加了抗美援朝的有生力量。在后方工作的同志们，要积极参加增产节约捐献武器的运动，认真订立爱国公约，加倍提高自己的工作效率。为了祖国的需要，随时继续准备组织更多的志愿手术队、防疫队去支援朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，为争取中朝人民反侵略战争胜利而努力，不达目的，誓不休止。这样，我们前方后方一条心，一个方向，一个目的，团结起来，我们的力量就无穷无尽，任何困难都能够克服。
    随着抗美援朝运动的开展，为数不少的医药卫生工作者热烈地响应政府的号召，踊跃地参加国防军的卫生建设。为祖国保卫者——中国人民解放军军队健康而服务。因为他们知道：在人民的中国，为自己的军队健康而服务是最光荣的。因此，他们到部队里去工作以后，并不认为部队生活艰苦、工作条件差，会降低自己的“正式大学毕业生”或“技术高明”的身份，并不斤斤计较个人的得失；相反的，他们认真地进行了自我教育与自我改造，因而，他们安心而积极地工作着，献出自己的知识和技术，来解除伤病员的疾苦，提高部队的技术水平。因为这样，也迅速地提高了他们自己的技术和政治觉悟。他们很快地就跟伤病员、跟部队同志一起生活，一起工作，互相学习，互相尊重。正因为这样，一方面部队工作同志得到他们的帮助，提高了自己的技术，另方面他们习惯了部队的生活和实事求是的作风，更感到全心全意为人民服务的光荣，要求和部队同志一样。如一位专家大夫说：“国民党反动派统治时期，用飞机请我也不去，今天穿上了人民军队的军装，我感觉到最光荣。”这就是人民热爱自己的军队，热爱自己的祖国的实际表现。这就是白求恩大夫所说的：“我们必须为了千千万万人的幸福与昌盛而运用技术，而不是为少数人去致富。”如果，有的人有了技术只计较个人的得失，而不用来为人民健康服务，为自己的军队健康服务，那是辜负人民对他的教育和希望的。我们应该从各方面对他进行耐心教育和帮助。这样，才能整齐我们的步伐，才能保证国防军卫生建设不断地得到全国医药界的支援，才会更迅速地开展国防军卫生建设，使人民军队指战员的健康获得充分的保证。
    医药卫生工作者们！我们祖国最危险的敌人——美帝国主义者不甘心朝鲜战场上的失败，正在加紧重新武装日本，时时刻刻都在威胁着我们的祖国的安全，也威胁着远东和世界的和平。毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议开会词中明确指示我们：“为了继续坚持这个必要的正义的斗争，我们就需要继续加强抗美援朝的工作，需要增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军。这是中国人民今天的中心任务。”因此，我们必须更好地发扬和学习白求恩大夫的国际主义精神；我们必须认真学习并在实际工作中运用苏联最先进的医学经验、军事医学经验；才会在抗美援朝的斗争中，在朝鲜战场上作出更好更大的成绩。这才是我们纪念白求恩大夫逝世十二周年的实际意义。让我们更紧密地团结一起，在毛泽东的旗帜下，为祖国人民健康，为人民军队健康而努力前进！（附图片）
