    Tianjin's Thirty-Two State-Owned Enterprises Increase Production and Practice Economy, Creating a Large Amount of Wealth; This Year's Profit Creation May Exceed the Planned 750 Billion Yuan

        [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The vast number of workers in Tianjin's state-owned factories and enterprises, in this year's patriotic labor emulation drive, have increased production and economized on a large amount of wealth for the country. From January to August this year, according to rough statistics from twenty-two units (including industrial and transportation factories and enterprises), the excess profit has already exceeded the planned profit by more than 414 billion yuan. According to the recent two months' situation, it is estimated by thirty-two units that by the end of the year, the total profit created throughout the year may exceed the planned 750 billion yuan.
    The main reason for achieving this result is that, encouraged by the spirit of patriotism in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, the vast number of workers have displayed a high degree of initiative and creativity in production, improved production efficiency, improved product quality, and reduced costs. For example, the Tianjin Paper Mill has completed its annual production plan 40 days ahead of schedule. The Tianjin Railway Bureau, due to the implementation of the economic accounting system, has saved funds and reduced transportation costs. At the same time, the "soft water method" was implemented when burning locomotive boilers, which doubled the maintenance mileage of each locomotive. The material costs for regular locomotive maintenance alone can save more than 70 million yuan per vehicle per year. In April, when welcoming "May Day," the workers of the Tianjin Steel Plant continuously created twenty-six new records. The output of steel ingots in the first three quarters of the plant was equivalent to 1.99 times the total output of the previous year. In the third quarter of this year, the total cost of the plant has been reduced by more than 12% compared to the first quarter. The state-owned cotton textile mills under the North China Textile Administration Bureau have reduced the raw material cost of yarn by 3.8% in the first half of this year compared to the past.

    天津三十二个国营企业增产节约大量财富
    今年创造利润可超过计划七千五百亿元
        【本报讯】天津市国营工厂企业的广大职工，在今年的爱国主义劳动竞赛中，为国家增产和节约了大量财富。从今年一月至八月，据二十二个单位（包括工业与交通事业的工厂企业）的约略统计，超额利润已超过计划利润四千一百四十余亿元。根据最近两个月的情况，到年底止，据三十二个单位的估计，全年创造的利润，可超过计划七千五百余亿元。
    取得这一成绩的主要原因，是广大职工在抗美援朝的爱国主义精神鼓舞下，在生产上发挥了高度的积极性与创造性，提高了生产效率，改进了产品质量，降低了成本。如天津造纸总厂已提前四十天完成了全年生产计划。天津铁路分局由于推行了经济核算制，节省了资金，降低了运输成本；同时，在烧机车锅炉时实行了“软水法”，使每台机车的检修公里延长了一倍，仅定期检修机车的材料费一项，每台车每年即可节省七千余万元。天津钢厂职工在迎接“五一”的四月份一个月中，连续创造了二十六件新纪录；该厂前三季钢锭的产量，已相当于去年全年产量的一点九九倍；今年第三季该厂总成本已较第一季降低了百分之十二以上。华北纺织管理局所属国营各棉纺织厂，今年上半年纱的原料费用较前降低了百分之三点八。　（天津日报）
