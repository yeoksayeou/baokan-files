　　Churchill's Promises Broken
　　Churchill recently delivered his first speech since taking office in the British House of Commons. This speech revealed the dire state of Britain's finances and economy due to its following of US imperialism in its frenzied arms race.
　　Churchill said that Britain's crisis of payment imbalance was more serious than in 1949, and in many ways even worse than in 1947; the rate at which its foreign payment deficit has increased in the past six months will cause Britain's finances to lose 700 million pounds annually.
　　The day after Churchill's speech, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Butler also delivered a "painful statement" in the House of Commons, announcing a series of measures to "save the country from bankruptcy and starvation," including cutting imports by 350 million pounds, eliminating decisions to build houses, increasing taxes, etc. The items with reduced imports mainly included meat, sugar, fruits, and vegetables, which are essential foods for people's livelihood.
　　Although Churchill and Butler both remained silent on the real reasons for today's British economic crisis, people are still very clear that this is because Britain's economy has been tightly bound to the chariot of US imperialism and has been dragged to the point of exhaustion.
　　The Conservative Party, like the Labour Party, follows the US war policy. Therefore, not only have the 300,000 houses that the Conservative Party promised to build annually for the British people before taking office vanished, but also the meager bread and butter on the tables of the British people have been taken away by the Conservative government and turned into bullets in the guns of British soldiers in Korea and Egypt! Churchill has once again used his actions to declare the shameful bankruptcy of his promises to the British people.

### 邱吉尔的诺言破产了

　　邱吉尔的诺言破产了
    邱吉尔最近在英国下院发表他上台后的第一次演说，这个演说透露出英国的财政经济由于追随美帝国主义疯狂备战而面临的恶劣情形。
    邱吉尔说，英国在支付方面入不敷出的危机比一九四九年，甚至在许多方面比一九四七年的情形还要严重；半年来对外支付赤字增加的速度，将使英国财政每年亏空七亿镑。
    在邱吉尔演说的第二天，英国财政大臣巴特勒也在下院发表了一个“沉痛的声明”，宣布了一系列的所谓“挽救国家免陷于破产和饥饿”的措施，包括削减入口货三亿五千万镑、剔除建造房屋的决定、增加税额等等，削减输入的项目中主要是肉类、食糖、水果与蔬菜等民生必需食物。
    虽然邱吉尔与巴特勒两人对于造成今天英国经济危机的真正原因都闭口不提，但是人们却仍然很清楚地知道，这是因为英国的经济已被紧紧地缚上了美帝国主义的战车，而被拖得精疲力尽了。
    保守党和工党一样追随美国的战争政策，因此不仅保守党在上台以前向英国人民允诺每年建造的三十万栋房屋，已经化为乌有了；就是英国人民桌上已经少得可怜的面包和牛油，也被保守党政府夺去变成了在朝鲜和埃及的英国士兵枪膛里的子弹！邱吉尔再一次在英国人民面前用他的行动宣告了他的诺言的可耻破产。
