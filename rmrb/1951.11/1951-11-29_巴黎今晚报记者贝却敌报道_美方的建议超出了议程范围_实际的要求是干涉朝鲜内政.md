    The US proposal exceeded the scope of the agenda
    The actual requirement is to interfere in North Korean internal affairs.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 28th] Paris Evening News reporter Bertrand reported from Panmunjom on the 28th: While staff officers from both sides of the Korean armistice negotiations began drawing the precise boundaries of the demilitarized zone on the map this morning, official representatives from both sides were discussing the merits and demerits of the proposals put forward by both sides yesterday to resolve the third agenda item. It can be seen at a glance that there is a great divergence between the two proposals. General Nam Il's proposal is a detailed draft based on the military demarcation line agreement. This proposal contains all the clauses necessary for the effective and rapid implementation of the armistice agreement. As General Nam Il said at the meeting yesterday, "As long as both sides make efforts, it is entirely possible to reach an armistice agreement within thirty days." General Joy's proposal is difficult to accept; its purpose is less to meet the needs of the third agenda item than to create eye-catching propaganda headlines. Under the heading of "concrete measures to eliminate possible resumption of hostilities," the US side hopes to establish a specific agency to ensure that military personnel, supplies and equipment are not increased during the armistice period and to ensure that observation teams can move freely throughout northern Korea. To naive people, at first glance, this seems like a harmless approach. However, the experience of Korea and the United States' prohibition of trade in "war materials" illustrates what this proposal actually is. The US Air Force refers to every Korean farmhouse as a hidden barracks of the Communist army. This has always been their excuse for barbarically destroying Korean villages. According to the US definition, repairing or rebuilding farmhouses and importing building materials can be regarded as increasing "equipment". Any measures to rebuild northern Korea and heal the wounds of war may be indefinitely delayed by the US definition of "supplies, equipment and gear". What the US side is actually demanding in their proposal is to exercise the same strict control over the economy of northern Korea as they do in southern Korea. Accepting this approach would lead to unwarranted interference in North Korean internal affairs. If the US side is truly willing to eliminate the possibility of future outbreaks of hostilities, then they can seek an agreement on the complete withdrawal of foreign troops as originally suggested by the Korean-Chinese side. This approach is much simpler than investigating which side is bringing in new troops, but the US side refuses to do so. This proposal is included in the fifth agenda item as a recommendation to the governments of the countries concerned. If the US side is willing, this point can still be discussed by the high-level personnel meeting. General Nam Il pointed out yesterday that the US proposal exceeded the scope of the third agenda item. There is no doubt that the US side's insistence on this point will seriously affect the possibility of an early ceasefire; on the other hand, it is believed here that if the US side hopes to seek a quick solution, as they did in the later stage of the discussion on the second agenda item after abandoning their unreasonable demands for Kaesong and sabotaging the agenda, then peace can still be achieved before Christmas - two days before the expiration of the thirty-day deadline for the current demarcation line to become a permanent ceasefire line.

    美方的建议超出了议程范围
    实际的要求是干涉朝鲜内政
    【新华社二十八日讯】巴黎今晚报记者贝却敌二十八日自板门店报道：当朝鲜停战谈判双方参谋人员在今天上午开始在地图上画非军事区的确实边界时，双方正式代表已在讨论双方在昨天提出的解决第三项议程的建议的优缺点。一眼就可以看出这两个建议之间有很大的分歧。南日将军提出的建议是根据军事分界线协议拟订的细致的草案。这个建议包含有效而迅速地执行停战协议所必需的一切条款。正如南日将军昨天在会议中所说的，“只要双方努力，在三十天以内取得停战协议是完全可能的。”乔埃将军提出的建议是很难接受的，这个建议的目的与其说是适应第三项议程的需要，倒不如说是制造引人注意的宣传的标题。美方在“消除可能恢复的敌对行动的具体措施”的题目下希望建立一个具体的机构，以保证不在停战期间增加军事人员、供应品和设备，并保证观察小组能够在朝鲜北部各地自由活动。对于天真的人们来说，乍看起来，这似乎是一点害处也没有的办法。但是，朝鲜的经验和美国禁止“战争物资”贸易的经验说明了这个建议实际上是怎样一回事。美国空军把每一个朝鲜农家都称为共产党军队的隐蔽的营房。这一直是他们野蛮地破坏朝鲜村庄的藉口。按照美方的定义，修理或重建农家的房屋和输入营造材料都可以被当作是增加“设备”。重建朝鲜北部和医治战争创伤的任何措施也许会被美方的“供应品、设备和装备”的定义无限期拖延下去。美方在他们的建议中实际要求的是对朝鲜北部的经济进行与他们在朝鲜南部所进行的一样严格的控制。接受这种办法将会引起对朝鲜内政的无理干涉。如果美方真正愿意消除未来的敌对行动爆发的可能性，那末他们可以像朝中方面原来建议的那样寻求关于外国军队完全撤退的协议，这种办法比调查哪一方开入新的军队要简单多了，但是美方不肯这样做，这个建议被列入第五项议程，作为对有关国家的政府的建议。如果美方愿意，这一点仍然可以由高级人员会议加以讨论。南日将军昨天指出，美方的建议超出了第三项议程的范围。毫无疑问，美方在这一点上固执己见将会严重地影响早日停火的可能性；另一方面，此间认为，如果美方像他们在关于第二项议程的后一阶段的讨论中放弃索取开城和破坏议程的无理要求以后那样希望迅速求得解决，那末，在圣诞节——目前分界线成为永久停火线的三十天时限满期以前两天——以前得到和平仍然是可能的。
