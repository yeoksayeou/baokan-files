Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 21st. On November 21st, our side's representative on the Korean armistice negotiation subcommittee stated that we agree in principle to the other side's proposal of November 17th, but the form of the other side's proposal is not in accordance with the form of a formal agreement. Our representative suggested that the complete and formal agreement on the second agenda item must include three components: determining the principle of the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone, immediately determining the location of the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone, and possible modifications of the determined military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone before the final signing of the armistice agreement. At the same time, our representative pointed out: the second agenda item must be resolved once and for all when discussing the second agenda item, without, as suggested in the other side's proposal, discussing the conditions related to the second agenda item thirty days after both sides have reached an agreement on the second agenda item. Therefore, our representative formally proposed that the subcommittee adopt the following agreement:

	"The subcommittee of the delegation of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers and the delegation of the United Nations Command hereby reach the following agreement regarding the second agenda item 'as a basic condition for the cessation of hostilities in Korea, determining the military demarcation line between the two sides to establish a demilitarized zone':

	(1) The principle of determining the military demarcation line based on the actual line of contact between the two sides, and each side withdrawing two kilometers from this line to establish a demilitarized zone.

	(2) The subcommittees of both sides should immediately, based on the principle of the preceding article, correct the existing line of contact to determine the actual line of contact agreed upon by both sides as the military demarcation line. The lines two kilometers on each side of the military demarcation line shall become the northern and southern boundaries of the demilitarized zone.

	(3) In view of the fact that hostilities will continue until the signing of the armistice agreement, if the plenary meeting of the delegations approves this agreement and the specific locations of the aforementioned military demarcation line and demilitarized zone, and all agenda items have been agreed upon within thirty days, then regardless of any changes in the actual line of contact between the two sides, the determined military demarcation line and demilitarized zone shall no longer be changed. If more than thirty days have passed and all agenda items have not been agreed upon, then it should be modified according to the changes in the actual line of contact between the two sides before the signing of the armistice agreement."

    我方声明原则上同意美方的新方案
    提出第二项议程的正式协议
    并指出这项议程必须在讨论时一次解决
    【新华社开城二十一日电】二十一日我方代表在朝鲜停战谈判小组委员会上声明在原则上同意对方十一月十七日的提案，但对方提案的形式与正式协议的形式不合。我方代表建议在第二项议程的完整的和正式的协议中必须包括三个组成部分，确定军事分界线与非军事地区的原则，即行确定军事分界线与非军事地区的位置以及已经确定的军事分界线与非军事地区在停战协议最后签字前可能的修正。同时我方代表指出：第二项议程必须在讨论第二项议程时一次获得解决，而无需像对方提案中所建议的一样，在双方对于第二项议程已经达成协议的三十天以后再行讨论有关第二项议程的条件。因此，我方代表正式提议小组委员会通过以下协议：
    “朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团及联合国军代表团双方小组委员会对于第二项议程‘作为在朝鲜停止敌对行为的基本条件，确定双方军事分界线，以建立非军事地区’，兹达成以下协议：
    （一）确定以双方实际接触线为军事分界线，并由此线双方各退二公里，以建立非军事地区的原则。
    （二）双方小组委员会应立即根据前条原则，校正现有接触线，以确定双方同意的实际接触线为军事分界线。而军事分界线两侧各二公里之线，即成为非军事地区的南北缘。
    （三）鉴于敌对行动将继续进行至停战协议签字时为止，如果代表团大会批准本协议及上述军事分界线与非军事地区的具体位置后的三十日内，全部议程已经达成协议，则不论双方实际接触线有何变化，已经确定的军事分界线及非军事地区应不再予变更。如超过三十天，而全部议程尚未达成协议，则应按照停战协议签字前的双方实际接触线所发生的变化加以修正。”
