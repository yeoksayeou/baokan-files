    Ignoring Political Education Work Among Industrial Workers Is Wrong
    Recently, Party leadership organs in North China and East China have begun to study and plan for conducting communist education among industrial workers. This is an extremely important link in the Party's work with workers. In the past two years, workers across the country have generally received political education once. A large portion of these workers have undergone tempering through the "Speak Bitterness" movement, the study of social development history, the democratic reform movement, and the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Movements, and their class consciousness has been greatly enhanced. The old methods of current affairs and political education can no longer meet their needs. However, some Party organizations and trade union cultural and educational departments have ignored this new situation. They have not earnestly studied the current political demands of the working class to further strengthen political education work for workers. Some have even one-sidedly proposed: "Political education has come to an end, and in the future, cultural education should be the focus." Others have proposed: "In the future, vocational education should be the focus." This is actually a viewpoint that cancels political education and a manifestation of ignoring political work among workers. This viewpoint is wrong and harmful. It should be affirmed that the Party's political education work for the working class should not only not be weakened in the future, but should also continue to be improved and strengthened. To this end, it is necessary to earnestly summarize experiences, correct the shortcomings of generalized content in past political education, unfixed teaching schedules, and lack of unified leadership, and conduct systematic communist and communist party education among the working class seriously and conscientiously. Recently, the propaganda departments of the East China Regional Party Committee specifically convened a political education meeting for industrial workers, formulating educational plans, steps, and implementation measures. The East China Region has determined to conduct a universal communist and communist party education for all industrial workers in the region before 1953. This comprehensive education plan is absolutely necessary.
    Various methods can be adopted to conduct communist and communist party education for workers. Many places have adopted forms such as party classes for party members and non-party members, night party schools, worker political schools, and worker activist training courses. These forms can be flexibly adopted by various localities, and the teaching content should also vary depending on the level of workers' awareness, but the basic link is that this work must be carried out under the unified leadership of the Party organization. The Party organization must plan and comprehensively assume the leadership responsibility of the vanguard in the political education work of workers.

### 忽视在产业工人中进行政治教育工作是错误的

    忽视在产业工人中进行政治教育工作是错误的
    最近华北、华东等地党的领导机关开始研究和计划在产业工人中进行共产主义教育。这是党在工人工作中极其重要的一环。两年来全国各地工人一般地都已经受到了一次政治教育，其中有很大一部分工人经过诉苦运动、社会发展史学习、民主改革运动和三大运动的锻炼，阶级觉悟已经大大提高，过去那一套时事政治教育办法已不能满足他们的需要。但是，有些党的组织和工会文教部门忽视了这种新的情况，他们没有认真研究工人阶级当前政治上的要求，进一步加强对工人的政治教育工作，有的竟片面提出：“政治教育告一段落，今后要以文化教育为主。”也有的提出：“今后要以业务教育为主。”这实际上是取消政治教育的观点，也是忽视在工人中进行政治工作的一种表现，这种观点是错误的和有害的。应当肯定：党对工人阶级的政治教育工作今后不但不应减弱，而且应当继续提高和加强。为此，必须认真总结经验，纠正过去政治教育中内容一般化，教学不固定，缺乏统一领导等缺点，严肃认真地在工人阶级中进行系统的共产主义和共产党的教育。最近华东等地党委宣传部门专门召开了产业工人政治教育会议，制订了教育计划、步骤和实施办法。华东区确定在一九五三年以前对全区产业工人普遍进行一次共产主义和共产党的教育。这种全面的教育计划是完全必要的。
    对工人进行共产主义和共产党的教育可以采取多种方法来进行。有不少地方采取了党员与非党员上党课、夜间党校、工人政治学校、工人积极分子训练班等形式，这些形式各地可以灵活采用，教学内容也应依据工人觉悟程度的高低而有所不同，但基本的一环是这一工作必须在党组织的统一领导下进行。党组织对工人政治教育工作要有计划地全面地负起先锋队的领导责任。
