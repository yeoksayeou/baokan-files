The Financial and Economic Work Committee of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee sent a letter to the provincial committees of North China and the Inner Mongolia Branch Bureau on the 12th of this month, which was also forwarded to the financial and economic committees of the respective provinces and regions, suggesting that various methods be used to widely disseminate experiences in agricultural bumper harvests. Prior to this, the Financial and Economic Work Committee of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee convened a symposium of twelve agricultural production experts from Hebei, Shanxi, and Pingyuan provinces to summarize their experiences in achieving bumper harvests.

The following is a summary of the original letter:

The twelve production experts from Hebei, Shanxi, and Pingyuan provinces all achieved very high yields per unit area this year. Cotton (including both irrigated and dry land) yielded 450 to 751 jin of seed cotton per mu, wheat yielded 544 to 715 jin per mu, corn yielded 680 to 1,000 jin per mu, and millet yielded 800 to 1,220 jin per mu, all exceeding the local average yield by more than double. In addition to organizing labor mutual aid, expanding investment, and overcoming disasters, the improvement and advancement of agricultural technology was also an important reason for their ability to achieve such high yields per unit area. The following are the common experiences and methods created by these bumper harvest experts.

	I. Implementing universal plowing, early plowing, deep plowing, and appropriately more plowing, and ensuring plowing followed by harrowing, multiple harrowing, and fine harrowing are the primary conditions for striving for bumper harvests.
	(1) Plowing universally two to three times and harrowing the land more than ten times, striving to make it even and flat.
	(2) Achieving autumn plowing, early plowing, and plowing immediately after harvest. In cotton-producing areas, cotton stalks should be removed around the time of frost and the stubble plowed early to allow the land to rest.
	(3) Plowing one to two cun deeper than ordinary farmers. In addition to using new-style walking plows, some use tandem plows, others turn the soil with shovels, and some use old-style plows to plow more than five cun deep. According to their experiments, deep plowing by two cun has the effect of two to three thousand jin of coarse fertilizer and can increase production by 15 percent. However, deep plowing should not turn out too much raw soil; it is best to deepen it gradually year by year.
	The plowing season should be flexibly controlled according to different natural conditions. In areas with two crops a year, emphasis should be placed on plowing after the summer harvest, "scratching the skin in the summer is better than plowing once in the autumn." In arid areas, plowing should aim to conserve moisture, emphasizing autumn plowing and autumn harrowing; spring may not require plowing but should involve multiple harrowing. In irrigated or areas with sufficient moisture, only plow in the autumn but do not harrow, which can kill insects and enhance weathering. In sandy land, in order to protect the soil and avoid wind erosion, and in alkaline land, in order to allow alkali to rise to the surface as much as possible (scraping the alkali from the surface before spring plowing), to facilitate spring sowing and seedling protection, autumn plowing is generally not carried out.

	In addition to ensuring more and earlier weeding, intertillage (hoeing seedlings) should also stipulate the time and depth of weeding according to the soil quality, moisture, and crop growth. For example, the method of hoeing cotton is mostly from shallow to deep and then from deep to shallow. Start with shallow hoeing, combined with thinning seedlings; hoe deeply in the middle to loosen the soil and facilitate the crop's roots to grow downwards; finally, hoe shallowly to avoid damaging the roots of the grown seedlings.

	II. Adopt different methods to cultivate and manage crops according to different natural conditions.
	(1) Appropriately adjusting the spacing between cotton plants is also an important method to increase production. Zhang Qirong, a labor model from Yuxiang County, Shanxi, planted cotton in 1949, leaving 1,300 seedlings per mu, producing 120 jin; in 1950, leaving 1,700 to 1,800 seedlings, producing 140 jin; this year, leaving 2,500 seedlings, producing 750 jin. From this, it can be seen that cotton should gradually achieve appropriate dense planting. Other crops should all widen the row spacing and shorten the plant spacing. In fertile soil with sufficient moisture and heavy fertilization, crops should generally be densely planted.
	(2) Cotton should be watered shallowly and frequently to maintain adequate moisture; water should also be applied in stages according to the needs of each period; generally, watering is not done during the seedling stage to allow the roots to grow downwards; from flowering to boll opening, watering should be done more than ten times, no more than two cun deep. Hoe after watering. Drain water during heavy rain.
	(3) Cotton should be pruned, topped, and have its "hairy legs" removed to limit excessive growth and allow more fruit to be produced. Topping should not be done too early or too late, and pruning should not be done too much or too little, depending on the soil fertility, fertilizer, and moisture conditions. The topping time is generally before the beginning of autumn. Regarding the number of branches to be left, according to Soviet experience, in general, more fertile paddy fields should leave ten to twelve branches, while dry land should leave seven to eight branches.

	III. Increase the amount of fertilizer and apply fertilizer rationally.

	The amount of fertilizer applied to the bumper harvest fields of each production expert is several times that of ordinary land, and they can apply it rationally to maximize fertilizer efficiency. On the one hand, they apply fertilizer in stages according to the needs of crop growth, such as applying a base fertilizer once before sowing, and then applying top dressing once or twice after the seedlings are established and before flowering. Cotton is mostly fertilized three or four times, with additional top dressing applied during the flowering, bud setting, and fruiting stages. On the other hand, different fertilizers are applied separately according to the different conditions of soil quality and crops. Slow-release fertilizers are used as base fertilizers, and quick-acting fertilizers are used as top dressing; in the early stages of crop growth, more nitrogenous fertilizers are applied, and in the middle stages, more phosphate and potash fertilizers are applied. To avoid these different fertilizers being used together and causing unfavorable chemical changes that offset each other's effects, they can be applied separately. They are also good at accumulating and managing fertilizer, generally sealing grass manure tightly to avoid wind, sun, and rain, which can reduce fertilizer efficiency; fertilizers of different properties are never mixed casually. Fertilizers are generally applied after being fully fermented.

	IV. Improving sandy, alkaline, and clay soils is also a good way to increase production.

	Improving sandy, alkaline, and clay soils is also a good way to increase production. The main methods are to exchange soil, adding black soil to sandy land and sandy soil to clay land, combined with fertilization year by year. When transforming sloping land into terraces in mountainous areas, the method of cutting inside and padding outside is often used to adjust the soil. Alkaline land can be treated with water washing, ditch drainage, and improved cultivation techniques to limit the rise of alkali. In addition, planting alfalfa can also change the soil of sandy and alkaline land.

    中共中央华北局财经工作委员会致函华北各省委
    建议广泛传播农业丰产的先进经验
    中共中央华北局财经工作委员会，于本月十二日致函华北各省委及内蒙分局，并转致各该省、区财政经济委员会，建议各地利用各种方式，广泛传播农业丰产经验。在此以前，中共中央华北局财经工作委员会曾召开了河北、山西、平原十二位农业生产能手的丰产座谈会，总结了他们的丰产经验。
    原函摘要如下：
    河北、山西、平原三省的十二位生产能手，今年都获得了很高的单位面积产量。计棉花（包括水地、旱地）每亩收到籽棉四百五十斤至七百五十一斤，小麦每亩收到五百四十四斤至七百一十五斤，玉茭为六百八十斤至一千斤，谷子为八百至一千二百二十斤，都超过当地平均产量一倍以上。他们所以能够获得这样高的单位面积产量，除了因为组织劳动互助，扩大投资，战胜灾害以外，农业技术的提高与改进，也是一个重要原因。以下是这些丰产能手创造的共同经验与办法。
    一、贯彻普耕、早耕、深耕、适当多耕，做到随耕随耙、多耙、细耙，这是争取丰产的首要条件。
    （1）普耕二遍至三遍，耙地十遍以上，尽量做到均匀平整。
    （2）做到秋耕、早耕、随收随耕。棉产区于霜降前后拔掉棉株，腾茬早耕，让地力休息。
    （3）比一般农民深耕一寸至二寸以上。除使用新式步犁外，有的采用套犁，有的以锨翻地，也有使用旧式犁耕到五寸多深的。据他们试验：深耕二寸，有相当于二、三千斤粗肥的功效，能增产百分之十五。但深耕不要翻出过多的生土，最好是逐年加深。
    耕作季节应根据不同的自然条件灵活掌握。在两季作物地区，应强调夏收之后进行伏耕，“伏里划破皮，胜似秋后犁一犁”。在干旱的地区，耕作以保墒为目的，强调秋耕、秋耙；春季可不耕，但要多耙。在水地或水分较充足的地区，秋季只耕不耙，可以杀虫和增强风化作用。沙地为了保护土壤，避免风刮，碱地为使碱分尽量上升到地面（春耕前将地面碱分刮去），便于春播保苗，一般的不进行秋耕。
    中耕（锄苗）除应做到多锄、早锄外，还应根据土质、水分及作物生长情况，规定锄苗的时间和深度。例如锄棉办法多是由浅而深，再由深到浅。开始浅锄，结合间苗；中间深锄，疏松土壤，便于作物向下扎根；最后浅锄，不伤成苗的根。
    二、根据不同的自然条件，采
    取不同方法，栽培和管理农
        作物。
    （1）适当调整棉花株行距，也是重要增产方法。山西虞乡县劳动模范张齐荣所种棉花，一九四九年每亩留苗一千三百株，产一百二十斤；一九五○年留一千七、八百株，产一百四十斤；今年留二千五百株，产七百五十斤。由此可知，棉花应逐渐做到适当密植。其他作物都应加宽行距，缩短株距。在地质肥沃，水分充足，施肥多的土地上，农作物一般应密植。
    （2）对棉花要浅浇、勤浇，经常保持适当水分；并根据各时期的需要分期施水；幼苗期一般不浇，让它向下扎好根；从开花到吐絮要浇十余次，深不过二寸。浇后要锄。雨大要排水。
    （3）棉花要整枝、打顶、去毛腿，限制棉株的过度生长，以便多结果实。打顶不宜过早、过晚，整枝不宜过多、过少，应根据地力、肥料、水分的情况决定。打顶的时间一般在立秋以前。关于留枝数量，根据苏联经验，在一般较肥沃的水田，以留十至十二枝为宜，旱地以留七、八枝为宜。
    三、增加肥量，合理施肥。
    各生产能手的丰产地的施肥量，多为一般土地施肥量的数倍，并能合理施用，发挥肥效。他们一方面根据作物生长的需要，分期施肥，如下种前普上一次底肥，定苗以后，开花以前，再施一、二次追肥。棉花多施至三、四次，在其开花、坐蕾、结实三个时期，加施追肥。另一方面，根据土质、作物的不同情况，分别施用不同的肥料。慢性肥料用作底肥，速性肥料用作追肥；在作物生长的早期，多施氮质肥料，中期多施磷肥、钾肥。为了避免这些不同的肥料用在一起，发生不利的化学变化，互相抵消功效，可分开应用。他们积肥和管理肥料的技术也很好，一般是严密封存草粪，避免风吹、日晒、雨打，丧失肥效；不同性质的肥料，绝不随意掺混。肥料一般都是经过充分发酵后才应用的。
    四、改良沙、碱地及黏土地，
        也是增产的好办法。
    改良沙、碱地及黏土地，也是增产的好办法。其主要方法是换土，沙地添黑土、黏地添沙土，结合施肥逐年进行。在山区变坡地为梯田时，多采用里切外垫的办法，以调剂土壤。对碱地则可采用水洗、挖沟排水及改进耕作技术，限制碱分上升的办法。此外，种植苜蓿也能改变沙、碱地的土壤。
