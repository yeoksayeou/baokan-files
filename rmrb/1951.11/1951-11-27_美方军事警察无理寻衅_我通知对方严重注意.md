Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 26th: Our correspondent reports: On November 22nd, a U.S. military policeman in the Panmunjom meeting area unreasonably made trouble, verbally abused our military police, and even threatened them with a pistol. Fortunately, our military police exercised great restraint and handled the situation properly, preventing an unfortunate incident. This matter was verified by a joint investigation by the military police officers of both sides, and the other side's military police officer expressed his apology. Our liaison officer has notified the other side's liaison officer to pay serious attention to this incident and prevent similar incidents from happening again.

    This incident occurred between two military police officers on duty from both sides in the joint security office tent in the Panmunjom meeting area. After 11:00 a.m. on the 22nd, a U.S. military policeman named Lang suddenly pointed a pistol at our Korean military policeman Pei Yingrong and made trouble unreasonably. Pei waved his hand to stop him and said, "Not good." The other side's military policeman then cursed Pei, "Beggar!" Pei did not reply. Afterwards, the other side's military policeman suddenly threw a book at Pei to provoke him. After Pei placed the book on the table, he criticized him, saying, "Not good." The other side angrily cursed Pei, "You bastard!" Then he loaded a bullet and threatened Pei with a pistol, again cursing, "You bastard!" Pei remained silent, only gesturing to stop him, and the other side's military policeman then put the pistol back into its holster.

    After our military police officer received the above report from Pei Yingrong, he immediately notified Lieutenant Herpos, the other side's military police officer, to come to the office at around 1:00 p.m. on the same day for a joint investigation. After both sides questioned the parties involved in person, and after the other side's officer questioned the other side's military policeman, Herpos admitted that the above incident was true and believed that it was harmful to the order of the meeting area. Therefore, he expressed his apology. Herpos also stated that he had removed the military policeman from his post and transferred him to his superiors for handling. In the afternoon of the 23rd, our chief liaison officer, Colonel Zhang, notified the other side's liaison officer, Colonel Murray, of the details of the above incident, pointing out that if our military police had not been good at handling the situation and exercised great restraint, a serious and unfortunate incident would have occurred. Colonel Zhang hoped that the other side would pay serious attention to this incident and prevent similar incidents from happening again. Murray promised to continue the investigation and asked our side to provide the investigation report on the incident to the other side, which Colonel Zhang immediately agreed to do.

    美方军事警察无理寻衅
    我通知对方严重注意
    【新华社开城二十六日电】本社记者报道：十一月二十二日，板门店会场区内美方军事警察一人，无理取闹，辱骂我方军事警察，甚至以手枪相威胁，幸我方军事警察百般忍耐，妥善处理，未演成不幸事件。此事经双方军事警察军官共同调查属实，对方军事警察军官当表示道歉。我方联络官已通知对方联络官严重注意这一事件，防止再有类似事件发生。
    这次事件发生在板门店会场区联合安全办事处帐篷内双方值班的两名军事警察之间。二十二日上午十一时以后，美方一个名叫郎的值班军事警察突然用手枪指向我方朝鲜军事警察裴英容，无理取闹。裴当向他摇手阻止说：“不好。”对方军事警察又骂裴：“叫化子！”裴未置答。其后，对方军事警察忽以书本向裴投掷寻衅。裴将书本放在桌上后，批评他说：“不好。”对方竟怒骂裴：“你这混蛋！”接着把子弹上膛后，用手枪指着裴施行威胁，又骂：“你这混蛋！”裴终未答话，仅摆手示意制止，对方军事警察才把手枪装进枪套中。
    我方军事警察军官接到裴英容上述报告之后，即在当天下午一时许，通知对方军事警察军官赫波斯中尉前来办事处共同调查。经双方向当事人当面查询，及对方军官向对方军事警察查询之后，赫波斯承认上述事件属实，且认为这是危害会场区秩序的，因此表示道歉。赫波斯并称已将该军事警察解除工作，转送上级处理。二十三日午后，我方首席联络官张上校将上述事件的经过通知对方联络官穆莱上校，指出：这次事件若非我方军事警察善于处理与百般忍耐，势将发生严重不幸事件。张上校希望对方严重注意这一事件，并防止再有类似的事件发生。穆莱答应继续调查，并请我方将事件经过的调查报告交给对方，张上校当即应允。
