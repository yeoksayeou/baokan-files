Propaganda Officer's Speech

    I. Increasing Production and Practicing Economy is the Fundamental Way to Strengthen
    Resistance to America, Aid Korea, and National Construction

    In mid-November, the employees of factories and mines under the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government sent a good news report to the people of the whole country: From January to September of this year, they increased production and practiced economy for the country, creating wealth equivalent to 6.8 million tons of grain. Calculated at 630,000 yuan per ton of grain, this wealth amounts to 4,284 billion yuan, which is more than the total amount pledged by the people of the whole country in the donation for aircraft and cannons movement (4,113.9 billion yuan as of November 17th) by more than 100 billion yuan.

    The Northeast working class has only over one million people. The total value of increased production and practicing economy this year can reach more than 11 million tons of grain. If the people of the whole country can learn from the experience of the Northeast working class, even though everyone's situation is different and the amount of increased production and practicing economy varies, the sum will definitely be a very large number. This will allow our country to increase countless wealth. Moreover, in this movement, there will be many inventions and creations, a large number of talents will be cultivated, and a lot of experience will be accumulated. These are all necessary conditions for strengthening our country's national defense construction and economic construction.

    The tasks of resisting America, aiding Korea, and national construction are very arduous. In terms of finance and economy alone, we have to support the volunteers and build a modern national defense force. One fighter plane costs 1.5 billion yuan, and one cannon costs 900 million yuan. This expenditure is very large. But this expenditure is necessary, and if this money is used, the American imperialist aggression can be defeated more quickly. Similarly, water conservancy projects, factories, mines, and schools all require money. This money should also be used. Our country spent a lot of money last winter and this spring, mobilizing more than two million people, and completed the first phase of the Huai River harnessing project. This year, tens of millions of people in our Huai River basin have received a harvest that they have not had in more than ten years. In the future, our people's motherland will need more and more money for economic construction and cultural and educational undertakings year by year.

    Resisting America and aiding Korea requires a lot of money, and building our country for a long time requires even more money. Where does this money come from? Of course, we cannot increase the state's income by increasing taxes or issuing banknotes indiscriminately, because this will increase the burden on the people and disrupt the stability of prices, which is detrimental to the people. We also cannot mainly rely solely on borrowing money from foreign countries and borrowing money from the people at home to solve the problem. Our friend the Soviet Union has already lent us a sum of money; the Victory Real Value Public Bond issued in January 1950 has greatly helped our country. But we cannot rely on borrowing money to live. Besides these methods, are there any other methods? Yes, that is to increase production and practice economy: On the one hand, use sparingly. One yuan should be used as two, or even ten, or a hundred yuan, and one yuan should be used to do the work of two, ten, or a hundred yuan. And the use of money should be based on the state's plan, and the money should be used in the most urgent and most needed places. On the other hand, increase income. That is, everyone should use existing equipment and existing labor to create more products and do more work. This method is the best way to solve the state's financial and economic difficulties, increase social wealth, and accumulate construction funds. The Soviet people adopted the method of increasing production and practicing economy in the economy and built their country into the most powerful country in the world. In the past, the old liberated areas implemented this method in the economy. Not only did they win the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, but they also improved the people's lives. Now, the mainland of the whole country has been liberated, and the conditions are much better than in the past. The results of implementing increased production and practicing economy will naturally be greater. Therefore, increasing production and practicing economy is not a temporary task for us at present, but the fundamental method for us to build a people's country.

    II. Increasing Production and Practicing Economy is Everyone's
        Sacred Responsibility
    Increasing production and practicing economy is something that everyone in the country can do. As long as you use your brain and learn from advanced experience, everyone can make achievements in the patriotic increase production and practice economy movement. For example, in industrial and mining enterprises, everyone can find ways to save funds, save raw materials, increase output, improve quality, reduce costs, and improve technology. After Shenyang Smelter launched the increase production and practice economy movement, the employees put forward more than 1,000 rationalization proposals in three months. By the end of September, the plant had overfulfilled the task of increasing production and practicing economy of more than 115,900 tons of grain. If all the employees in the country do this, how much wealth will they add to the country in a year! In rural areas, everyone can strive to produce more grain per mu. This year, Qu Yaoli, a cotton planting expert in Shanxi Province, produced 920 catties of cotton per mu. Zhang Xishun, a labor model in Hebei Province, produced 1,250 catties of millet (millet valley) per mu. The 200 mu of rice planted by the Zou Yubin mutual aid group, a labor model, produced an average of 1,030 catties per mu, and Zou Yubin's produced 1,288 catties per mu. The cultivated land area in our country is about 1.44 billion mu. If the peasant brothers all over the country can increase the yield on the existing land, as long as they can produce more than ten catties of grain per mu, the whole country can produce 15 billion catties more grain, which is equal to the value of nearly 10,000 fighter planes. In the industrial and commercial circles, we should accumulate funds, expand production, expand investment, improve management, and reduce waste. These are beneficial to the country and to the industrialists and merchants themselves. In our state administrative organs and educational organs, although we cannot directly increase production, we can strive to improve work efficiency, practice strict economy, and oppose waste, so as to reduce the state's expenditures. After some organs in Beijing recently formulated a savings plan, public expenses for next year can be saved by a quarter. It can be seen that if all the organs in the country do this, they can save a lot of wealth for the country.

    III. Everyone Should Rise Up and Wage a Resolute Struggle Against Waste of State Wealth
    Contrary to the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, some people are still intentionally or unintentionally wasting the state's manpower and resources, and even embezzling and stealing state property. Everyone should rise up and wage a resolute struggle against this phenomenon that harms the interests of the motherland. This year, in the anti-corruption movement in Shenyang City, it was discovered that the four major corruption cases discovered in the Shenyang Branch of China Coal Industry Construction Company alone caused the state to lose more than 4 billion yuan. Recently, some illegal industrialists and merchants in Chongqing, Hankou, Nanjing, Shanghai and other places have been found to be speculating and raising prices, cutting corners, and even dragging and deceiving in the processing and ordering work for the state, stealing a large amount of wealth from the people. This year, the People's Daily has continuously published many wasteful events in basic construction projects. Due to incorrect design and construction, each of these projects has brought losses of several billion or even tens or hundreds of billions of yuan to the country. Some people do not cherish public property. For example, in the past two years, Shanghai Jiao Tong University has lost more than 160 million yuan in damaged wooden beds alone. In the areas where land reform was implemented last year in Central South, East China, and Southwest China, some places experienced events of eating, drinking, and wasting the fruits of land reform. These phenomena must rely on everyone's consciousness and mass supervision to be stopped. We should create a social atmosphere in which everyone is proud to cherish state property and add wealth to the state. Everyone has the responsibility to report and accuse those who embezzle and waste state wealth. When increased production and practicing economy are carried out, and corruption and waste are reduced or eliminated, we will be more powerful in attacking the American aggressors and build our motherland faster.

### 为什么要开展增产节约运动？

专栏：宣传员讲话

    为什么要开展增产节约运动？
    一、增产节约是加强
    抗美援朝和国家建
    设的根本办法十一月中旬，东北人民政府工业部各厂矿的职工，给全国人民发出了一个捷报：他们在今年一月到九月，为国家增产节约了价值六百八十万吨粮食的财富。这笔财富，按每吨粮食折合人民币六十三万元计算，就有四万二千八百四十亿元，比全国人民在捐献飞机大炮运动中的认捐总数（十一月十七日止为四万一千一百三十九亿元）还多一千多亿元。
    东北工人阶级人数只有一百多万，他们今年增产节约的全部价值就可以达到一千一百多万吨粮食。全国人民如果都能学习东北工人阶级的经验，尽管各人的情况不同，增产节约的数目有大有小，但加起来一定是一个非常大的数目，这将使我们的国家增加数不清的财富。而且在这一运动中，还会出现许多发明创造，培养出大批人材，积累很多经验。这些都是加强我们祖国的国防建设和经济建设的必要条件。
    抗美援朝和国家建设的任务是十分艰巨的。单就财政经济方面说，我们要支援志愿军和建设现代化国防部队，一架战斗机就要十五亿元，一门大炮就要九亿元。这笔开支是很大的。但这笔开支是必要的，如果用了这些钱，就能更快地打败美帝国主义的侵略。同样，兴修水利、办工厂、开矿、设学校，样样都得要钱。这些钱也是应该用的。我们的国家去年冬天和今年春天，用了很多钱，动员了两百多万人，完成了修治淮河的第一期工程，今年我们淮河流域几千万人就得到了十多年来从没有过的丰收。今后我们人民祖国在经济建设和文化教育事业上需要的钱，会一年比一年多。
    抗美援朝要用很多的钱，为了长期建设我们的国家要用更多的钱。这些钱从那儿来呢？我们当然不能用增加税收、滥发钞票的办法来增加国家的收入，因为这会加重人民负担，破坏物价的平稳，这是对人民不利的。我们主要地也不能只依靠向外国借钱和向国内人民借钱来解决问题。我们的朋友苏联已经借了一笔钱给我们；国内一九五○年一月份发行的胜利折实公债，对我们的国家有很大的帮助。但我们不能依赖借钱来过日子。除了这些办法之外，还有没有别的办法呢？有的，就是增产节约：一方面，节省着用。一个钱要做两个钱甚至十个钱、一百个钱用，用一个钱要办两个钱、十个钱、一百个钱办的事。并且用钱要根据国家的计划，把钱用在最迫切、最需要的地方。另一方面，要增加收入。就是要大家用现有的设备和现有的劳动力，创造出更多的生产品，做更多的工作。这个办法，是解决国家财政经济困难，增加社会财富，积累建设资金的最好方法。苏联人民在经济上采用了增产节约的办法，把自己的国家建设成为世界上最强大的国家。过去老解放区在经济上实行了这个办法，不独取得了抗日战争和解放战争的胜利，还改善了人民的生活。现在，全国大陆都解放了，条件比过去好多了，实行增产节约的成绩自然会更大。所以，增产节约不是我们目前的一个临时任务，而是我们建设人民国家的根本方法。
    二、增产节约是全国每一个人
        的神圣责任
    增产节约是全国每一个人都可以作到的。只要动脑筋，学习先进经验，每个人都可以在爱国增产节约运动中做出成绩。比如，在工矿企业里，大家都可以想办法节约资金、节约原料材料、提高产量、质量，降低成本，改进技术。沈阳冶炼厂在开展增产节约运动以后，在三个月内职工们就提出了一千多条合理化建议，全厂到九月底就超额完成了增产节约十一万五千九百多吨粮食的任务。全国职工都这样做，一年能为国家增添多少财富啊！在农村里，大家都可以努力使每亩地多打一些粮食。今年山西省的植棉能手曲耀离，每亩地产棉九百二十斤。河北省劳动模范张希顺种的谷子（小米谷）每亩地产一千二百五十斤。劳动模范邹玉彬互助组种的二百亩水稻，每亩平均产一千零三十斤，邹玉彬的每亩产了一千二百八十八斤。我国耕地面积大约有十四亿四千多万亩。全国农民兄弟如果都能在现有的土地上提高产量，每亩地只要能多产十斤多粮食，全国就能多生产一百五十亿斤粮食，就等于近万架战斗机的价值。在工商界，应该积累资金、扩大生产、扩大投资，改善经营，减少浪费。这些，对于国家，对于工商业者自己，都是有好处的。在我们的国家行政机关和教育机关里，虽然不能直接增加生产，但是可以努力提高工作效率，并且厉行节约，反对浪费，来减少国家的开支。北京有些机关，最近订出节约计划之后，明年的公共费用可以节省四分之一。可见，全国所有的机关都这样作，就能为国家节约许多财富。
    三、大家起来和浪费国家财富
            的行为作坚决的斗争
    和增产节约的精神相反，现在有一些人还在有意无意地浪费着国家的人力物力，甚至贪污、窃盗国家的财产，大家都应该起来和这种损害祖国利益的现象进行坚决的斗争。今年沈阳市在反贪污运动中发现，仅中国煤业建筑公司沈阳分公司等处发现的四个较大贪污案件，就使国家损失了四十多亿元。最近重庆、汉口、南京、上海等地发现某些不法工商业者在给国家的加工订货工作中，投机抬价，偷工减料，甚至拖骗欺诈，窃盗了人民的大量财富。今年人民日报上连续发表过许多基本建设工程中的浪费的事件。这些事件，由于设计、施工不正确，每一件工程都给国家带来了几亿甚至几十、百亿元的损失。还有些人不爱惜公物，如上海交通大学两年来，仅损坏木床一项就损失了一亿六千多万元。在中南、华东、西南等地去年实行土地改革的地区，有些地方发生了大吃大喝、浪费土地改革果实的事件。这些现象，都是要依靠大家的自觉和群众的监督，来加以制止的。我们应该造成一种社会风气，人人以爱护国家财产，给国家增添财富为光荣。对于贪污、浪费国家财富的人，人人有检举和控告的责任。增产节约开展了，贪污浪费减少了或者消灭了，我们就能更有力量地打击美国侵略者，就能更快地建设我们的祖国。
