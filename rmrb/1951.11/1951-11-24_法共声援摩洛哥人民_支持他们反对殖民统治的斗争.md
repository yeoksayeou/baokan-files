　　French Communist Party Voices Support for the Moroccan People
	Supports Their Struggle Against Colonial Rule
    [Xinhua News Agency, November 21st] According to a TASS report from Paris on the 18th: In view of the fact that the French government, in collaboration with the Anglo-American bloc, is now trying to obstruct the United Nations from discussing the Moroccan issue, the French Communist Party issued a statement supporting the Moroccan people's struggle for freedom and national independence and against French colonial rule.
    The French Communist Party first pointed out: The so-called Protectorate Treaty imposed colonial oppression, condemned by the French people, on the Moroccan people. The vast majority of the Moroccan people are trapped in terrible poverty. Among the nine million residents of Morocco, there are fewer than six hundred doctors, but there are fourteen thousand policemen. Of the 1.8 million school-age children, only 115,000 are enrolled in school. This is a tragic portrayal of the hypocrisy of the so-called "civilizing mission" of the French colonialists. The most basic freedoms of Moroccan workers, especially trade union rights, are also deprived. These things prove that the French rulers are constantly undermining human rights and the constitutional principles of the French Republic.
    The French Communist Party then pointed out: "Morocco has become an important base for the Atlantic aggressive organization, and many war bases and strategic raw material producing areas have been ceded to American imperialism. The brutal suppression intensified by the French rulers in Morocco is ordered to maintain order and security for the benefit of their American masters."
    In its statement, the French Communist Party expressed its support for the Moroccan people's struggle for freedom and national independence, and paid tribute to the powerful Moroccan national movement, and to the thousands of patriots who have been imprisoned, exiled, and deported.
    The French Communist Party's statement concluded: The French Communist Party is determined to do everything in its power to abolish the despicable Protectorate Treaty and to win recognition for the Moroccan people's right to freely determine their own destiny.

　　法共声援摩洛哥人民        
    支持他们反对殖民统治的斗争
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十八日讯：鉴于法国政府现在正在美英集团协同之下竭力阻挠联合国讨论摩洛哥问题，法国共产党特发表声明，支持摩洛哥人民争取自由和民族独立、反对法国殖民统治的斗争。
    法国共产党首先指出：所谓保护权条约把那受法国人民谴责的殖民压迫强加在摩洛哥人民身上。绝大多数摩洛哥人民都陷于可怕的贫穷中。在摩洛哥九百万居民中，医生还不到六百人，而警察倒有一万四千人。在一百八十万学龄儿童中，入学的只有十一万五千人。这就是法国殖民者所谓“文明使命”的虚伪性的悲惨写照。摩洛哥劳动者的最基本自由，特别是工会权利也被剥夺。这些事情证明法国统治者不断破坏人权和法兰西共和国宪法原则。
    法国共产党然后指出：“摩洛哥已经变为大西洋侵略机构的重要基地，许多战争基地和战略原料产地已割让给美帝国主义。法国统治者在摩洛哥加紧进行的残酷镇压，是奉命为美国主子的利益来保障秩序和安全。”
    法国共产党在声明中表示支持摩洛哥人民为自由和民族独立而进行的斗争，并向强大的摩洛哥民族运动，向数千个被下狱、被流放、被驱逐出境的爱国者致敬。
    法国共产党的声明最后说：法国共产党决心以一切力量去争取废除卑鄙的保护权条约，争取承认摩洛哥人民有权自由决定自己的命运。
