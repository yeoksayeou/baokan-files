Most National State-Owned Enterprises Actively Promote Asset Inventory and Capital Verification; A Few Enterprises Still Do Not Pay Attention to This Work, and Should Take Immediate Action

At present, most state-owned enterprises across the country are actively carrying out the work of asset inventory and capital verification. A few leading cadres of state-owned enterprises have not paid attention to this work, or pay lip service to it but do not actually take it seriously, resulting in delays in the progress of this work. This phenomenon should be corrected immediately.

Currently, twelve units of the central-level financial and economic system have successively established capital verification committees and assigned full-time cadres; seven ministries have convened meetings of their affiliated professional institutions on asset inventory and capital verification; some units have held training classes to study the policies of asset inventory and capital verification; some units have completed inventory and started valuation; most departments have formulated specific implementation plans and supplementary measures for each unit, and have demarcated the scope of fixed assets and working capital. Individual enterprises have preliminarily verified their capital, and will soon enter the capital verification stage completely. The Central Ministry of Fuel Industry has compiled and distributed a price list of machines and major equipment, and organized five working groups to go to the affiliated enterprises in East China, Northwest China, Tianjin, and Datong on the 5th of this month to assist and inspect the work, in order to create models, summarize experience, and promote the overall situation.

State-owned enterprises in the Northeast region cleared their assets in 1950, implemented independent accounting, and determined their capital, which prepared sufficient conditions for accelerating capital turnover. For example, the Northeast Industrial Department increased the turnover rate of working capital of its affiliated enterprises to 25%, striving to exceed the task of saving 2.4 million tons of grain. In North China, the state-owned enterprises in Hebei, Shanxi, Suiyuan, Chahar, and Tianjin have largely completed asset inventory and are now carrying out valuation and preparing to verify capital. The East China region has issued the decisions and instructions on national asset inventory and capital verification to the enterprise departments of its provinces and cities. Under the leadership of the Capital Verification Committee of the Nanjing Municipal Financial and Economic Committee, enterprises in Nanjing corrected the deviation of the preparatory stage work remaining with a few cadres, and carried out universal and in-depth mobilization of cadres and the masses to implement the education of capital verification. For example, using radio to open up the thinking of cadres, and publishing publications on capital verification to exchange experience. The director and deputy directors of the Nanjing Municipal Financial and Economic Committee and responsible cadres went deep into enterprises to conduct inspections and provide specific guidance at any time, which improved the morale of employees and promoted the work. The Central South region convened a regional asset inventory and capital verification meeting on the 5th of this month, attended by more than 300 representatives from relevant departments, and conveyed and deployed the central government's decisions and instructions on asset inventory and capital verification in a serious manner. As of August, 165 units in the Southwest region had inventoried and verified capital in the asset inventory and capital verification work. The region strives to complete the asset inventory and capital verification work by the end of November this year. In the process of the work, some units combined this work with production, maintenance, security inspections and other tasks, deeply mobilized the masses, and made the workers realize the importance of asset inventory and capital verification. The workers then actively participated as masters, not only clearing out a large number of materials, but also improved their political understanding. Some units did not pay enough attention to this work, did not mobilize deeply, and could not combine it with other tasks, so the progress of the work was very slow. A factory in eastern Sichuan district, due to insufficient mobilization work, dared not expose extra materials cleared out by the workshop, and threw them into the waste pile; some workers also believed that capital verification was "wage verification." The asset inventory and capital verification meeting in the Northwest region closed on September 27. This meeting was held at the same time as the Northwest region's democratic reform meeting for industry and mining. At this meeting, the central government's decisions and instructions on asset inventory and capital verification were conveyed; the steps of asset inventory and capital verification in the Northwest were determined; the supply system thinking that only asked about production but not management was criticized; the serious phenomenon of accumulated funds and the inability to fully exert industrial potential were exposed; this meeting has laid the foundation for the asset inventory and capital verification work in the Northwest region.

On a national scale, asset inventory and capital verification, preparing to implement economic accounting system and planned management, this serious political task has attracted the attention of cadres in most enterprise departments. However, there are also a few enterprise leaders who do not care much about this issue, and have not put this central task in an important position; or pay lip service to it, but have not carried out in-depth publicity and mobilization, and have not deeply mobilized the masses, which is very wrong. Clearing assets, verifying capital, implementing economic accounting system, implementing planned management, improving enterprise management, accelerating capital turnover, mobilizing the masses to increase labor enthusiasm, and fully exerting the inherent strength of enterprises to achieve a truly socialist state-owned economy, this is the current direction of state-owned enterprises. State-owned enterprise departments should act quickly with a fighting attitude!

    全国大多数国营企业积极推行清理资产核定资金工作
    少数企业还不重视这一工作，应立即行动起来
    全国各地大多数国营企业，正积极进行清理资产核定资金工作。少数国营企业的领导干部还没有重视这一工作，或者口头上重视，实际上不重视，致使这一工作的进度延缓下来。这种现象应即纠正。
    目前，中央一级财政经济系统已有十二个单位先后建立了核定资金委员会，并配备了专职干部；有七个部曾经召开了所属专业机构的清理资产核定资金会议；有的单位举办了训练班，学习清理资产核定资金的政策；有的单位已经完成了清点，开始了估价；大多数部门已制定了各单位的具体实施方案和补充办法，划分出固定资产和流动资金范围。个别企业已初步核定了资金，不久将全部进入核定资金的阶段。中央燃料工业部已编发了机器和主要器材价格目录，并组织了五个工作组，于本月五日分赴华东、西北、天津、大同所属企业单位协助与检查工作，准备创造典型，总结经验，推动全盘。
    东北区国营企业已于一九五○年清理了资产，实行了独立会计，确定了资金，为加速资金周转准备了充分条件。如东北工业部，把所属企业流动资金周转率提高至百分之二十五，争取超过节约粮食二百四十万吨的任务。华北的河北、山西、绥远、察哈尔及天津的国营企业，清理资产已大致告一段落，现正进行估价，并准备核定资金。华东区对全国清理资产核定资金的决定与指示，已下达于该区所属各省市的企业部门。南京市各企业在市财政经济委员会核定资金委员会领导下，纠正了准备阶段工作停留在少数干部身上的偏向，对干部和群众进行了普遍的深入动员，以贯彻核定资金的教育。如利用广播以打通干部思想，出版有关核定资金的刊物以交流经验。南京市财政经济委员会正副主任及负责干部深入企业进行检查，随时给以具体指导，提高了职工情绪，推进了工作。中南区已于本月五日召开了全区的清理资产核定资金会议，出席有关部门代表三百余人，对中央有关清理资产核定资金的决定和指示，认真地进行了传达与布置。西南区的清理资产核定资金工作，至八月份，已有一百六十五个单位，清点核定了资金。全区清理资产核定资金工作，争取在本年十一月底全部完成。在工作进行中，某些单位与生产、检修、保安大检查和其他任务相结合，深入发动群众，使职工们认识到清理资产核定资金的重要，职工就积极地以主人翁身份来参加，不仅清理出大批物资，而且也提高了职工的政治认识。有些单位对这一工作重视不够，动员不深入，不能与其他任务相结合，工作的进行就很迟缓。川东区某厂因动员工作不够，车间清出额外物资不敢暴露，就向废品堆里乱丢；有的工人还认为核定资金是“核定工资”。西北区的清理资产核定资金会议，已于九月二十七日闭幕。这个会议是与西北区工矿民主改革会议同时举行的。在这个会议上，传达了中央关于清理资产核定资金的决定与指示；确定了西北清理资产核定资金的步骤；对于只问生产不问经营的供给制思想，进行了批判；对于积压资金的严重现象和不能充分发挥工业潜力的情形，予以揭发；这个会议，已为西北区清理资产核定资金的工作奠定了基础。
    在全国范围来说，清理资产核定资金，准备实行经济核算制与计划管理，这一严重的政治任务，已引起多数企业部门干部的注意。但是也有少数的企业领导干部，还不大关心这一问题，还没有把这个中心任务，放在重要地位；或者是口头上注意，实际上没有进行深入的宣传动员，没有深入地发动群众，这是很不对的。清理资产，核定资金，实行经济核算制，实行计划管理，改善企业经营，加速资金周转，发动群众提高劳动热情，充分地发挥企业内部的  在力量，达到名符其实的社会主义性质的国营经济，这是国营企业目前的努力方向。国营企业部门应以战斗的姿态，迅速地行动起来！
