    The People of the Whole Country are Working Hard to Increase Production and Practice Economy; No Embezzlers are Allowed to Steal State Property
    Editor: After reading the news in the People's Daily on October 22 about the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government severely punishing the embezzler Liu Shaojie, I felt that this measure by the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government was absolutely necessary.
    As everyone knows, corruption is an ugly behavior left over by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The four major families, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, made their fortunes by embezzling state assets and exploiting the blood and sweat of the broad masses of the people. The criminal Liu Shaojie brought the shameless behavior of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang into the revolutionary ranks, and instead of repenting, he continued to embezzle the assets of the state and the people. This is absolutely intolerable to the broad masses of the people.
    Now, the people of the whole country are highly patriotic and are trying every means to increase production and practice economy, increase the wealth of the motherland, and defeat the aggression of American imperialism and build a better life for the people's motherland as soon as possible. For this reason, I wholeheartedly support the measures taken by the People's Government against the embezzler Liu Shaojie, and hope to use this incident to educate all the people.

    Everyone Should Fight Against Those Guilty of Malfeasance and Embezzlement Editor: I warmly support the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government's severe punishment of criminals guilty of malfeasance and embezzlement.
    Embezzlement is the most shameful act and is not allowed by the laws and disciplines of the country. It seriously endangers the interests of the country and the people. I believe that in the future, every staff member should work hard to study the country's policies and laws, raise awareness, and actively wage a relentless struggle against those guilty of malfeasance and embezzlement. Only in this way can we safeguard the interests of the country and the people and build our great motherland faster.

    Embezzlers are Enemies of National Construction Editor: The incident of the Director of the Industry and Commerce Department of the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government, etc., supporting subordinates in illegally selling gold, and the Deputy County Chief of Sa County in the province, Liu Shaojie, embezzling state property, makes people feel very indignant. I fully support the People's Government's sentencing them to imprisonment and death respectively.
    Zhang Qingzhong, Zhang Guolin and others, as leading cadres of the government, actually undermined the state's financial policies for the narrow interests of their own units; Liu Shaojie even embezzled a large amount of state property. These are enemies on the road to national production and construction. Only by giving such people the punishment they deserve can we maintain the prestige of our People's Government.
    For the victory of our resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, and for the construction of our country, everyone should rise up and report embezzlers in institutions and organizations.

    全国人民都在努力增产节约
    不许贪污分子盗窃国家财产
    编辑同志：我看到十月二十二日人民日报刊载的绥远省人民政府严惩贪污分子刘绍杰的新闻后，觉得绥远省人民政府的这项措施是完全必要的。
    大家都知道，贪污是蒋介石匪帮遗留下的丑恶行为，以蒋介石为首的四大家族就是靠贪污国家资产和剥削广大人民的血汗而发家的，而罪犯刘绍杰带着蒋介石匪帮的无耻的行为走进革命队伍，非但不痛改前非，却继续贪污国家人民的资产，这是广大人民绝对不能容忍的。
    现在，全国人民都高度热爱自己的祖国，都在想尽办法增产节约，增加祖国的财富，以早日打败美帝国主义的侵略军和建设人民祖国的美好生活。为此，我衷心地拥护人民政府对贪污犯刘绍杰所采取的措施，并希望以此事件教育全体人民。

    每个人都应该向渎职贪污分子进行斗争编辑同志：绥远省人民政府严惩渎职贪污罪犯，我表示热烈拥护。
    贪污是最可耻的，是国家法纪所不能允许的行为，它严重地危害了国家人民的利益。我认为，今后每个工作人员都应努力学习国家政策法令，提高觉悟，积极地向那些渎职贪污分子进行无情的斗争。只有如此，才能保卫国家人民的利益，使我们伟大的祖国更快地建设起来。

    贪污分子是国家建设的敌人编辑同志：绥远省人民政府工商厅厅长等支持所属违法出售黄金和该省萨县副县长刘绍杰贪污国家财产的事件，使人感到非常激愤。人民政府对他们分别处以徒刑和死刑，我完全拥护。
    张庆中、张国林等身为政府领导干部，竟为了本单位的狭小利益而破坏国家金融政策；刘绍杰更大量贪污国家资财，这是国家生产建设前进路上的敌人。只有使这种人受到应有的惩处，才能保持我们人民政府的威信。
    为了我们抗美援朝的胜利，为了建设我们的国家，人人都应该起来检举机关、团体中的贪污分子。
