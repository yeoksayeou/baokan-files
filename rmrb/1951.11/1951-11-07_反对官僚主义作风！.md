Editor's Note: The letters published here illustrate how the bureaucratic work style of certain state organs and leading cadres is a major cause of waste of state property and the greatest enemy of increasing production and practicing thrift. Therefore, while carrying out the movement to increase production and practice thrift, we must resolutely fight against bureaucratic work styles. The following five letters, except for the first and fifth, are from the Correspondence Group of the Central People's Supervision Committee. According to the Correspondence Group, the local people's governments have already disciplined the parties involved in these incidents.

    The East China Construction Company Doesn't Bother About
    the Private Jiankang Construction Company's Profiteering

Editor: The state-owned East China Construction Company, after accepting the task of a culvert project in Yizheng, northern Jiangsu, entrusted by the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission in March of this year, handed it over to the private Jiankang Construction Company in Nanjing to handle. However, Jiankang Construction Company stole 61 million yuan of state property simply by submitting false accounts. In addition, it requested subsidies of 16 million yuan for management fees and more than 20 million yuan for formwork costs used on the construction site from the East China Construction Company, totaling more than 97 million yuan. Because of shoddy work and the use of substandard materials, serious cracks have now been found in this project.

The cement, drainage pipe and other projects of a certain bureau in Hankou and the Huainan Mine project in northern Anhui were also subcontracted by the East China Construction Company to the Jiankang Construction Company. The total value of these projects was more than 1.76 billion yuan, and the Jiankang Construction Company obtained a huge profit of more than 870 million yuan beyond its costs. The Jiankang Construction Company exploited workers to a great extent in the process of subcontracting. For example, the wage for subcontracting each 36-inch reinforced concrete drainage pipe was 90,000 yuan, but the wage subcontracted to foreman Shen Yuanji and others was only 11,700 yuan per pipe; the wage for subcontracting each double-hole floor hollow brick was 2,448 yuan, but the wage subcontracted out was 400 yuan; the wage for subcontracting each cement square tile was 800 yuan, but the wage subcontracted out was 187 yuan.

The state-owned East China Construction Company's indifferent attitude towards the illegal profiteering of the private Jiankang Construction Company is a manifestation of bureaucratic work style. The state property suffered huge losses on these projects, and I believe the state-owned East China Construction Company should bear the main responsibility. I hope the company will quickly investigate and deal with this matter.
                                                                                                Dong Guangcheng

    Responsible Cadres of Baoxing Coal Mine
    Disregard Fire Threats
    Causing Huge Losses of State Property

The fire threat in the No. 2 pit of the Baoxing Coal Mine in Xiayuan, Chahar Province, was already very serious, but the responsible cadres turned a blind eye, neither paying attention to safety equipment nor conducting strict inspections. At 9:00 p.m. on December 17, 1950, a fire was discovered somewhere, but the deputy manager and others still did not go down into the pit to rescue, nor did they contact the manager (who lived elsewhere). Some cadres went down into the pit, but only briefly "arranged things" and then went back up to sleep as usual. It was not until 8:00 a.m. on the 18th that the manager arrived at the mine and established a fire command headquarters, but the fire was raging and could not be saved. This fire caused a loss of 3.3 billion yuan.

    Leading Cadres of Chongqing Public Transport Company
    Neglect Safety Equipment, Causing Serious Incident
    Resulting in More Than Thirty Casualties

The Chongqing Public Transport Company paid no attention to the safety problems of using "natural gas" to power buses, only issuing "Natural Gas Precautions" and printing booklets of "Natural Gas Instructions." However, most of those who released natural gas were newly recruited young workers of seventeen or eighteen years old. Most employees believed that "releasing gas is very simple, a novice only needs to study for two or three days." Sometimes even station staff who had not studied it replaced people to release the gas. The leading cadres of the company did not correct the above situation. The trade union preparatory committee raised the issue of safety equipment, but the leading cadres turned a deaf ear. Therefore, in March 1951, the No. 603 "natural gas" bus managed by a young worker caught fire, causing a serious incident in which 39 people were killed or injured (13 dead, 26 injured).

    Leading Cadres of the Southern Sichuan Agricultural and Forestry Department
    Lightly Believe False Reports on Logging Plans, Causing Great Waste

The Southern Sichuan Agricultural and Forestry Department's logging plan was inaccurate, causing great waste. Lan Tingxi (former employee), the leader of the survey team of the department, did not go to the survey site in person after accepting the survey task, but falsely reported that there were 3,362,483 trees that could be felled in Huangshan and Shangzhou, with a timber volume of 234,428 cubic meters. The deputy section chief (former employee) of the forestry section of the department responsible for planning did not review or study the figures, and then drafted a logging plan. The leading cadres of the department had heard in the past that there were no trees in Huangshan, but they did not carefully consider the figures of the forestry section, and organized thousands of laborers to go to the logging site in two large teams. When the first team arrived at the designated location, it found that there were less than one percent of the trees that could be felled compared to the original plan. The second team searched for three days in the designated location, but did not find a single tree that could be felled. Although they later changed the location to fell trees, it had been delayed for half a month, and some laborers were dismissed, resulting in a great waste of labor. In terms of financial resources, according to preliminary statistics, the loss was about 12 million yuan.

    Staff of the Changzhi Branch of Xinhua Bookstore
    Have a Serious Bureaucratic Work Style

Editor: We are medical students studying at Changzhi Provincial Hospital. Our main difficulty in studying is the lack of books. Once, we mailed an order for a batch of books to the Shandong General Branch of Xinhua Bookstore. After receiving the letter, the store sent all the books on May 23. When the books arrived at Changzhi Post Office, the post office mistakenly sent them to the Changzhi Branch of Xinhua Bookstore. The Changzhi Branch of Xinhua Bookstore accepted the books muddle-headedly, and opened them and sold them. We longed for the books for a long time, but they never came, and there was no news after inquiring. At that time, some students happened to find some books in the Changzhi Xinhua Bookstore that were the same as the books we wanted to buy, and they became suspicious. The first time (July 8) we went to the store to inquire, we saw a female comrade, and she said she would check for us, her tone as if she knew something. Two days later, we went to ask again, and she replied: "We checked, these books are ours, and have nothing to do with you." A few days later, we asked Comrade Wang, who was in the bookstore and receiving treatment in the hospital, and two of our students to go and ask together. After arriving at the store, we could not see a responsible person, and Comrade Wang relayed the information back and forth, saying that they were very busy and could not take care of it now. Later, a comrade wearing a white undershirt came out and said: "We are a state-owned bookstore. If the books are yours, we will definitely give them to you. It may be a mistake. We will check it when we have time." His attitude seemed to be bothered. We had to return disappointed. Later, after the post office inquired the store, the store finally admitted it officially. However, the store delayed for more than 20 days and still did not return the books to us. We were very anxious, so we had to go to the Changzhi Xinhua Bookstore again. After running twice, we finally saw the person in charge. At this time, he said a few polite words, and finally said: "The missing books are still not there; let me give you money!" We really couldn't wait any longer, so we had to agree to take the money. As for the remittance fee and postage, we still had to bear it all. This has been delayed for nearly three months, delaying our study for more than two months. The comrades who did not get the books also had to pay the postage for nothing, which is really annoying.

Now we are telling you about this matter, hoping that you will publish it. We believe that the Changzhi Xinhua Bookstore should make a public self-criticism of this matter.
                                                                                       Shanxi Changzhi Medical Training Class

Editor's Note: We have forwarded this letter to the General Branch of Xinhua Bookstore. The General Branch of Xinhua Bookstore has replied, stating: "These criticisms reflect that the bureaucratic work style and irresponsible attitude of our Changzhi branch have reached an intolerable level. We have decided to instruct the manager of our Shanxi branch to inspect the work of the Changzhi branch. After clarifying the situation and distinguishing responsibilities, the parties involved and the responsible persons will be given due criticism or punishment, and a public self-criticism will be conducted in the newspaper."

    反对官僚主义作风！
    编者按：这里发表的几件来信，说明某些国家机关和领导干部的官僚主义作风，是造成国家财产浪费的重大原因，是增加生产，厉行节约的最大敌人。因此，我们在开展增产节约运动的同时，必须坚决对官僚主义作风作斗争。以下五封信，除第一、五两封信外，均为中央人民监察委员会通讯组的来信，据该通讯组称，各地人民政府对这些事件的当事人已经分别予以处分。
    华东建筑公司对私营建康
    营造厂获取暴利竟不闻不问编辑同志：公营华东建筑公司于今年三月接受长江水利委员会委托的苏北仪征某涵闸工程后，即交南京市私营建康营造厂代办。但建康营造厂仅虚报假账，就窃取国家财产六千一百万元；另外向华东建筑公司请求补贴管理费一千六百万元和工地所用壳子板费二千余万元，共达九千七百余万元。该项工程因为偷工减料，现已发现严重的裂缝现象。
    汉口某局某处的水泥、沟管等工程及皖北淮南某矿工程，亦由华东建筑公司转包给建康营造厂承做。该几项工程总值计十七亿六千多万元，除其成本外，建康营造厂获暴利达八亿七千多万元。其中工资部分，建康营造厂在包进包出之间，剥削甚巨。比如包进三十六吋钢筋混凝土沟管每只工资为九万元，转包给工头沈元计等每只只一万一千七百元；双孔楼板空心砖包进每只工资为二千四百四十八元，包出则为四百元；水泥方洋瓦包进每片工资为八百元，包出则为一百八十七元。
    公营华东建筑公司对于私营建康营造厂非法获取暴利，采取不管不问的态度，是一种官僚主义作风的表现。在这些工程上，使国家财产蒙受巨大损失，我认为公营华东建筑公司应负主要责任。希望该公司迅速检查并处理这件事情。    董光珵
    宝兴煤矿负责干部
    对火灾威胁熟视无睹
    造成国家财产巨大损失
    察哈尔省下花园宝兴煤矿，二坑火灾威胁已很严重，负责干部竟熟视无睹，既不注意安全设备，也不进行严格检查。一九五○年十二月十七日下午九时发现某处着火，副经理等仍不下坑抢救，也不与经理联系（经理另住一地）。有的干部虽然下坑，但只简单地“布置一下”，即照常上坑睡觉。直到十八日上午八时，经理到矿，才成立救火指挥部，但火势熊熊，已不能救了，此次火灾计损失人民币三十三亿元。重庆市公共汽车公司领导干部
    忽视安全设备造成伤亡三十
    余人的严重事件
    重庆市公共汽车公司，对使用“天然气”发动汽车的安全问题，毫不注意，只颁布了“天然气注意事项”和印制了“天然气须知”的小册子。但放天然气的，大都是新招的十七、八岁的青年工人。一般职工都认为“放气很简单，一个生手只要学习，两三天就行”。甚至有时未经学习的站员也代替放气。该公司领导干部对于上述情况竟不加纠正。工会筹备委员会曾提出安全设备问题，领导干部又置若罔闻。因此，一九五一年三月，一青年工人管理的六○三号“天然气”汽车发生燃烧事件，造成死伤三十九人（死十三人、伤二十六人）的严重事件。川南农林厅领导干部
    轻信谎报采伐计划浪费很大
    川南区农林厅采伐计划不确实，造成很大浪费。该厅勘查小组长蓝廷熹（旧职员）接受勘查任务后，不亲往勘查，竟谎报黄山、商州二地可伐林木三、三六二、四八三株，材积为二三四、四二八立方公尺。该厅负责计划的林木科副科长（旧职员），对该项数字也不加审查研究，就拟伐木计划。该厅领导干部过去听说过黄山无树，但对林木科的数字也未慎重考虑，便组织民夫千人，分两个大队前往采伐。第一大队到达被指定地点，发觉当地可伐树木尚不足原计划的百分之一。第二大队在指定地点寻找三日，未见一株可伐之树。后虽转地采伐，但已延迟时间半月之久，并资遣民夫一部，使人力造成很大浪费。在财力方面，据初步统计，约损失一千二百余万元。
    新华书店长治支店人员
    有严重的官僚主义作风编辑同志：我们是医务学员，在长治省立医院学习。我们在学习中的主要困难是没有书。有一次我们向新华书店山东总分店邮购一批书籍，该店接信后，将书在五月二十三日全部发出。书到了长治邮局，该局将书误送到新华书店长治支店。新华书店长治支店竟糊里糊涂把书收下，而且打开就卖。我们渴望许久，书籍老不来，查询也没有着落。当时有的同学偶然在长治新华书店发现有些书籍与我们要买的书一样，发生怀疑。我们第一次（七月八日）去该店询问，见到一位女同志，她说代我们查查看，口气好像有些知道。过了两天，我们第二次去问，她答：“我们查了，这些书是我们的，与你们无关。”又隔了几天，我们托在医院养病的一位书店里的王同志，和我们的两个学员一道去问。到该店后，也见不到一位负责人，全由这位王同志里外来回传达，说他们忙的很，现在顾不上。后来出来一位穿白汗褂的同志，说：“我们是国营书店。书如果是你们的，一定会给你们，可能是错了。我们有时间查查再说吧。”态度好像嫌麻烦。我们只得废然而返。后经邮局向该店查问，该店才算正式承认了。但该店拖延了二十多天，还没有把书偿还我们。我们焦急得很，只好再去找长治新华书店。跑了两次，才见到负责人。他这时才算说了几句客气话，最后说：“短少的书，仍是没有；给你们钱吧！”我们真是不能继续等了，只好答应要钱。至于汇费和邮费还全部由我们负担。这样拖延了将近三个月，耽误了我们两个多月的学习，没得到书的同志，还得白出邮资，真是恼极了。
    现在我们把这件事告诉你们，希望你们予以刊载。我们认为长治新华书店对此事应作公开检讨。
    山西长治医学进修班
    编者按：这封来信我们曾转给新华书店总店。新华书店总店已有复函，略称：“这些批评，反映了我店长治支店的官僚主义作风及不负责的态度已到了不能容忍的地步。我们决定，责成我店山西分店经理去检查长治支店的工作。查明情况，分清责任后，将分别给予当事人和负责人以应得的批评或处分，并在报纸上进行公开的检讨。”
