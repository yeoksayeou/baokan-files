    Chongqing Lijiatuo Shashi Yarn Factory Negligence
    Cotton Warehouse Set on Fire by Special Agents
    Comrade Editor: The cotton warehouse of the Shashi Yarn Factory in Lijiatuo, Chongqing, was set on fire by special agents, causing significant damage to the cotton stored in the warehouse by the factory and the Southwest China Company of the China National Cotton Yarn & Piece Goods Corporation. On July 17th, the anniversary of the founding of the factory's trade union, the workers gathered in the back playground to celebrate, and the guard company stationed at the factory also left the factory to attend a meeting at the camp headquarters. The special agent Yin Guangsheng (leader of the factory's police squad), who was lurking in the factory, took the opportunity to set the fire. Before liberation, Yin was a loyal lackey of a major special agent. After liberation, he remained unrepentant, colluding with special agents Ran Zhiping, Zhu Qingping, and Peng Tianquan (all hidden in the factory) to continue sabotage activities. Special agent Yin Guangsheng originally planned to destroy the water tower of the nearby China Wool Textile Factory (the only water source nearby) and the rare cotton steel wire in the Shashi Yarn Factory's ginning room, but both were unsuccessful due to tight security. This time, Yin Guangsheng seized the gap when all the workers were holding a celebration meeting, instructed Peng Tianquan to guard the gate, and ordered Ran Zhiping to take advantage of the cotton being moved from the warehouse, using clothing to conceal a barrel of gasoline and carry it into the warehouse, where it was sprinkled on the raw cotton. Around 11:00 AM, when the cotton handling workers were all resting, Yin instructed Zhu Qingping to borrow the warehouse key from warehouse manager Xu Xuezhu under a pretext. The two criminals personally carried gasoline bottles and two timed incendiary devices and inserted them into the cotton piles. Around 1:00 PM, the warehouse was completely on fire. All the workers of the factory, the stationed troops, and personnel from nearby factories and fire brigades bravely fought the fire, and it was not until 4:00 PM that the fire was completely extinguished. Currently, Yin Guangsheng and the other four arsonist special agents have been arrested by the Ba County Public Security Bureau.
    The fire destroyed more than 600 dan of lint cotton, and more than 900 dan were soaked and charred, resulting in a total loss of more than 973 million yuan in Renminbi.　Zhou Shusheng

    Editor's Note: The arson incident by special agents at the Shashi Yarn Factory in Lijiatuo, Chongqing, once again clearly tells us that lurking enemies are always watching for opportunities to plot sabotage, and any complacency and satisfaction with existing achievements is extremely dangerous. All regions should learn from this incident, increase vigilance, and resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries.

    重庆李家沱沙市纱厂麻痹大意
    棉花仓库被特务放火
    编辑同志：重庆市李家沱沙市纱厂的棉花仓库被特务放火，致使该厂和中国花纱布公司西南区公司存放在库房的棉花受到很大损失。七月十七日是该厂工会成立一周年纪念日，职工们在后操场集会庆祝，驻该厂的警卫连也离厂赴营部开会。潜伏该厂的特务尹光胜（该厂厂警队班长）即乘机放火。尹犯在解放前就是大特务的忠实走狗。解放后仍执迷不悟，勾结特务冉治平、朱清萍、彭天铨（均隐藏于该厂）继续进行破坏活动。特务尹光胜原拟破坏附近的中国毛纺织厂水塔（附近的唯一水源）和沙市纱厂清花间稀贵的棉钢丝，但均因防备严密，未能得逞。这次尹光胜又抓住全体职工开庆祝会的空隙，指使彭天铨看守大门，叫冉治平趁开仓库搬运棉花时，用衣服掩蔽汽油一桶带进仓库，洒在原棉上。上午十一时左右，搬运棉花的工人都已休息，尹便指使朱清萍借故从仓库管理员徐学祖手里取得仓库钥匙，两犯亲自携带汽油瓶子及两块定时燃烧品塞入棉堆中。下午一时左右，仓库即全部起火。该厂全体职工、驻军和附近工厂及消防队等人员奋勇抢救，至下午四时，才将火全部扑灭。现尹光胜等四个纵火特务，已被巴县公安局逮捕。
    此次火灾，共烧毁皮棉六百余担，被水渍及焦烂的有九百担，合计损失人民币九亿七千三百多万元。　周树声
    编者按：重庆市李家沱沙市纱厂特务放火事件，又一次清楚地告诉我们：潜伏的敌人随时都在伺机阴谋破坏，任何麻痹大意和满足于既得成绩的想法，都是极端危险的。各地都应从这一事件中取得教训，提高警惕，并坚决镇压反革命。
