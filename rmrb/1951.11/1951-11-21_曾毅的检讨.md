    Zeng Yi's Self-Criticism
    (I) Errors Committed in Handling the House Issue
    When I divorced Wang Yizhi in 1941, the court ruled that all the property I was entitled to should be given to Wang Yizhi. However, I had always been indifferent to this issue. At the time of the divorce, I only thought about the legal rights I had obtained, and I did not keep in mind the responsibilities I should have had towards Wang Yizhi. When Wang Yizhi wanted the house, I initially adopted an attitude of indifference and did not actively help. But when my mother wanted the house, I thought: If I make my mother unhappy, there will be a lot of trouble that I cannot afford. I did not consider how Wang Yizhi would live after losing the property she was entitled to, and I thought Wang Yizhi could be bullied. So, I took the house back from Wang Yizhi and gave it to my mother. Although my mother said she would divide the house again after taking it back, I did not urge my mother to do so. When Wang Yizhi came to me twice, I irresponsibly told her to go to the court herself to file a claim. I did not think that I should take the initiative to file a claim. This was a contemptuous and indifferent, even arrogant attitude towards Wang Yizhi's legitimate rights. I adopted an indifferent attitude towards Wang Yizhi's rights and the mental and physical suffering she endured after the divorce. This stems from feudal ethical concepts and male chauvinistic ideas that disregard women's rights. Examining my position, firstly, I did not actively and resolutely enforce the law, and I violated the spirit of the Marriage Law; secondly, I only saw the beneficial aspects of the law for myself, and I did not actively enforce the unfavorable aspects.
  I had no awareness of this issue before, and I used "being busy with work" and emotional resistance as cover. In fact, these were only superficial phenomena, not the essence of the problem. It was only after the help of many comrades that I gained a preliminary understanding.
    (II) The Issue of Hitting Someone
    It was right for Wang Yizhi to seek me out for help after losing the house in Gaoyang. I did not patiently discuss solutions with her, but rudely said, "If you have any demands, make them directly. I will resolve what I can resolve, and it's useless to make demands that I cannot resolve." I did not adopt a serious and responsible attitude. When it was time to go to work, I chased her out, which was already wrong. After an argument, she splashed water all over me, and I started hitting her, which was even more wrong. After hitting her, I forced the workers to drag her out. When the workers did not comply, I hit one of the workers. This development of a contemptuous attitude towards women into crude and arrogant actions is an extremely serious mistake. I am a Communist Party member of many years and a responsible cadre of the school, and it is a betrayal of the hopes the Party and the people have placed in me to do such a thing.
    Before, I had not recognized these problems and still felt that I had not made any mistakes. I found some facts and "reasons" to explain that I was justified, and I was unwilling to face up to and deeply consider the parts where I was wrong. Regarding the handling of the property, I emphasized that subjectively I did not want to withhold it from Wang Yizhi. Regarding hitting Wang Yizhi, I emphasized that it was caused by Wang, and I emphasized that I did not hit her hard.
    The ideological source of these erroneous actions is my class background and past experiences. My family was a landlord family, and I could be willful and do whatever I wanted in family life. Studying abroad for a long time went smoothly, which did not overcome this erroneous consciousness but rather allowed it to develop. Although I have made some corrections under the education of the Party after joining the revolution, there are still many remnants.
    Recently, after the criticism and help of comrades, especially after the criticism and education of the higher-level Party committee, I have realized the seriousness of the mistakes.
    In the future, I plan to publicly review this issue in the school. Under the education of the Party and the supervision of comrades, I will humbly accept the opinions of comrades, strictly demand myself, and strive to correct my mistakes.
    Today's self-criticism is still far from adequate. I hope comrades will offer more criticism and help, and I hope the court will give me the punishment I deserve.

### 曾毅的检讨

    曾毅的检讨
    （一）处理房子问题所犯的
            错误
    一九四一年离婚时，法院判决将我所有应得的财产，分给王益智，但是我对这个问题一向是漠视的。在离婚时只想到自己得到的合法权利，而自己对王益智应负的责任没有放在心里。当王益智要房子时，最初我采取漠不关心的态度，不积极帮助。但当我母亲要房子时，我却想：把母亲惹得不高兴了会有很多麻烦，惹不起。至于王益智丢掉她应得的财产后，如何生活，根本没考虑，并且认为王益智可以欺侮。我就从王益智手里把房子要回来，给了母亲。母亲虽然说要回房子后再分，而我并未督促母亲这样作。王益智两次来找时，我只是不负责任地叫王益智自己到法院去提出，并未想到我应该主动地去提出，这是对王益智的正当权利的轻视和不理睬的蛮横态度。对王益智的权利和她在离婚后在精神上和生活上所受的痛苦，采取漠视态度，这是封建的伦理观念和轻视妇女权利的男权统治思想。检查起立场来，首先是，未主动坚决地执行法律，而且违背婚姻法的精神；其次是，只看到法令对自己的有利部分，无利部分就不主动去执行。
  以前对这个问题完全没有认识，而以“工作忙”作掩护，以感情对抗作掩护，其实这些只是表面的现象，不是问题的实质，经过很多同志帮助才使我有了初步认识。
    （二）打人问题
    王益智失掉高阳的房子后，很不满意，她找我来替她想办法是应该的。我没有很耐心地和她研究办法，只是粗暴地讲：“你有什么要求直接提出来，我能解决的就解决，不能解决的你再提也没用。”没有采取严肃负责的态度去作。到上班的时候了，就撵她出去，这样作法已经不对；争吵起来后，她泼了我一身水，就动手打起她来，这更不对；在打了她以后，又逼着工友把她拉出去，工友没有照作时，又打了工友一下。这种轻视妇女的心理发展到粗暴蛮横的行动，是极端严重的错误。我是一个多年的共产党员，又是学校负责的干部，做出这种事来，有负党和人民对我的希望。
    以前对这些问题我还没有认识到，还觉得自己没有什么错误，找些事实和“理由”说明自己有道理，对自己无理的部分就不愿正视和深入考虑。对财产的处理强调主观上不是不愿给王益智；对于打王益智强调是由王引起的，而且强调打得不厉害。
    这种错误行动的思想根源，是我的阶级出身和过去的经历所造成的。我的家庭是地主家庭，在家庭生活中可以任性地为所欲为。长期在国外读书时一切都很顺利，使这个错误的意识没有克服，反而得到发展。参加革命后虽然在党的教育下有所改正，但残存的还很多。
    最近经过同志们的批评和帮助，特别是经过上级党委的批评和教育，使我认识到错误的严重性。
    今后想把这问题在学校中公开进行检讨，在党的教育和同志们的监督下，虚心接受同志们的意见，严格地要求自己，努力改正错误。
    今天的检讨还很不够，希望同志们多多批评帮助，希望法院给我应得的处分。
            曾毅　一九五一年十一月十七日
