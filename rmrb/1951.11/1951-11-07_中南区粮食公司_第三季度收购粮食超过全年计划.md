The Central South Region State-Owned Grain Company's grain purchase volume in the third quarter has exceeded the annual purchase plan for this year by 34.81%. Compared with the same period last year, the purchase volume of wheat increased by 23.5 times, and rice increased by 3.8 times. After the new grain was put on the market, the Central South Region State-Owned Grain Company adopted the policy of "large-scale purchase and large-scale sale," increasing the number of institutions, sending mobile purchase teams, or entrusting public and private businesses and cooperatives to go deep into medium and small markets and primary markets for large-scale purchases. On the other hand, it vigorously transported and sold grain to major cities and grain-deficient areas within the region, thus balancing grain prices in grain-producing areas, major cities, and grain-deficient areas within the region, and ensuring the over-fulfillment of the state's purchase tasks. The State-Owned Grain Company of Shangrao Prefecture, Jiangxi Province, also paid attention to the investigation of the grain production and sales situation in the area and the flexible allocation of purchasing power, thereby mastering the main grain markets and their changes. For example, after the amount of grain on the market in Shangrao City decreased, the State-Owned Grain Company of the area transferred some cadres from the Shangrao City Grain Company to major markets such as Guixi and Yingtan.

Strengthening the management of the grain market is also a guarantee for the smooth development of the purchase work. In late August, in some markets in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, the price difference with other regions was not reasonable enough. In addition, the local people's government industrial and commercial departments initially did not strictly manage the grain market. As a result, private merchants and a few public business units rushed to purchase grain, forming a disconnection between the listed price and the market price. The purchase volume of the State-Owned Grain Company once shrank, sometimes even less than 20% of the market volume. After the local people's government industrial and commercial departments discovered the above situation, they immediately strengthened the management of the grain market, unified the purchase plans and grain prices of various units, and strictly stipulated transaction methods, so that grain transactions gradually entered the right track, and the proportion of grain purchases by State-Owned Grain Companies in various places increased to more than 80% of the market volume on average. In late August, the Industrial and Commercial Bureau of the Hengyang Municipal People's Government in Hunan Province converted the original six markets in the city into grain trading markets, and convened a meeting of public and private purchasing units and exchange representatives to announce various measures for managing the grain market, thereby normalizing the amount of grain on the market in the city in September, making the listed price and market price consistent, and increasing the state purchase volume from 3% of the market volume to 66%.

### 中南区粮食公司  第三季度收购粮食超过全年计划

    第三季度收购粮食超过全年计划
    中南区国营粮食公司第三季度收购粮食的数量已超过今年全年收购计划的百分之三十四点八一，和去年同期比较，小麦的收购量增加了二十三倍半，稻谷增加了三点八倍。中南区国营粮食公司在新粮上市后，采取了大买大卖的方针，一面增设机构，派出流动收购组，或委托公、私商业和合作社深入中、小市场和初级市场大量收购，另一方面大力向区内各大城市和缺粮地区运销粮食，因而平衡了区内产粮地区和大城市、缺粮地区的粮价，保证了国家收购任务的超额完成。江西省上饶专区国营粮食公司在收购中还注意了对该区粮食产销状况的调查和机动地配备收购力量，因而能掌握主要的粮食市场和它们的变化情况。如上饶市粮食上市量减少后，该区国营粮食公司就从该市粮食公司抽调了部分干部到贵溪、鹰潭等主要市场上去。
    加强对粮食市场的管理也是顺利开展收购工作的保证。八月下旬，湖南、江西两省部分市场因与其他地区之间的差价不够合理，加以当地人民政府工商行政部门起初对粮食市场管理不严，因而私商和少数公营企业单位纷纷抢购粮食，形成粮食牌价和市价的脱节现象，国营粮食公司收购量一度缩小，有时还不到上市量的百分之二十。当地人民政府工商行政部门发现上述情况后，立即加强管理粮食市场，统一各单位收购计划和粮食价格，并严格规定交易办法，才使粮食交易逐步纳入正轨，各地国营粮食公司购粮比重平均上升到上市量的百分之八十以上。湖南省衡阳市人民政府工商局在八月下旬将该市原有的六处市场改辟为粮食交易市场，并召集了公私收购单位及交易所代表开会，宣布管理粮食市场的各项办法，因而使该市九月份粮食上市量趋于正常，牌市价趋于一致，国家收购量由占上市量的百分之三提高到百分之六十六。（新华社）
