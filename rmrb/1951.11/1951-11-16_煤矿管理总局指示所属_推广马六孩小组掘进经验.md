　　Coal Mine Management Bureau Directs Subordinates to Promote Ma Liu Hai Group's Tunneling Experience
　　The Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government issued a directive on October 27 to the North China and East China bureaus and mines to promote the multi-hole rapid tunneling experience of the Ma Liu Hai group of Datong Coal Mine. The directive pointed out: Since the implementation of the new mining method in various bureaus and mines, the old tunneling method has been unable to meet the needs of the new mining method. In order to greatly improve the efficiency of tunneling work, various bureaus and mines should, in accordance with the specific conditions of each mine, organize employees to implement multi-hole rapid tunneling, conscientiously learn from Ma Liu Hai's advanced experience. Each mine and bureau should establish a dedicated cadre to lead the promotion of this advanced experience, frequently understand the situation of the tunneling teams, solve the difficulties they encounter in the promotion, help them improve their technology, create experience from the promotion, and summarize these experiences in a timely manner to disseminate to various locations.

    推广马六孩小组掘进经验
    中央人民政府燃料工业部煤矿管理总局在十月二十七日指示华北、华东各局、矿推广大同煤矿马六孩小组多孔道快速掘进的经验。指示指出：新采煤法在各局、矿先后实行以来，旧掘进法已不能适应新法采煤的需要。为了大大提高掘进工作的效率，各局、矿应按照各矿的具体情况，组织职工实行多孔道快速掘进，认真学习马六孩的先进经验。各矿、局应设专责干部领导推广这一先进经验，经常了解掘进小组的情况，解决他们在推广中所遇到的困难，帮助他们改进技术，从推广中创造经验，并把这些经验及时总结出来传播各地。（新华社）
