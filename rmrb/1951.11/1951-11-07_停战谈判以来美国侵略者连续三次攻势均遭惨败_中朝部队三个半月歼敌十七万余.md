Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, November 6th: Our front-line correspondent reports: In the nearly four months since the start of the ceasefire talks on July 10th, American aggressors have continuously launched frantic offensives. Among them, the larger-scale offensives were three: the first was the offensive in the eastern sector north of Yangkou-Linje-Ganseong; the second was the offensive in the western sector from northwest of Tieyuan to Gaolangpuli; and the third was the offensive in the central sector east of Jinhua to "Heartbreak Ridge." In these three offensives, the American aggressors used nearly 300,000 troops from nineteen divisions, and almost all of their artillery and tanks.

As is well known, the purpose of the American aggressors in launching the war of aggression against Korea was primarily to destroy the whole of Korea. However, from the summer of last year to the summer of this year, the invading army suffered serious losses; at the same time, the desire of the people of the world to peacefully resolve the Korean question has become increasingly strong, and therefore the American aggressors were forced to accept the proposal for ceasefire talks in July. Even so, the American aggressors have not changed their extremely vicious policy of aggression to plunder foreign lands, and therefore two situations of the same nature have emerged during the ceasefire talks: one is that at the negotiating table, the U.S. side constantly uses despicable tactics of deception, attempting to plunder the land it demands without paying a price; the other is that on the battlefield, the American aggressors, regardless of heavy losses, constantly launch frantic offensives, coupled with the air force indiscriminately bombing and strafing towns and villages in northern Korea, attempting to force the Korean people to submit to their insane slaughter. Therefore, Ridgway hastily announced at the start of the ceasefire talks that a ceasefire would not take effect until the negotiation agreement was formally signed.

The American aggressors are using the opportunity of the ceasefire talks to prepare and launch larger-scale offensives. At the beginning of the talks, Ridgway and Van Fleet successively went to the front to personally deploy, and then the aggressors not only launched frequent reconnaissance attacks along the entire front but also actively prepared for large-scale offensives.

After replenishing and adjusting their forces, the invading army launched frantic offensives in the eastern sector with eight divisions from August 18th, focusing on the area north of Yangkou-Linje. This offensive lasted until late September, and failed due to heavy losses. Afterwards, the invading army shifted the focus of its offensive to the western sector, launching a frantic offensive in the area from northwest of Tieyuan to Gaolangpuli on September 29th. In order to save the disastrous defeat in the eastern sector, the invading army invested more than five divisions in this offensive, and cooperated with a large number of tanks, aircraft, and dozens of artillery groups. Therefore, Van Fleet dared to clamor in a statement issued on September 30th that "the United Nations forces have begun their autumn offensive." However, the first round of this offensive suffered a disastrous defeat after two weeks of intense fighting. Subsequently, the invading army launched the second round of the "autumn offensive" in the eastern part of the central sector on October 13th. In this offensive, Van Fleet invested four divisions and used more tanks, aircraft, and artillery groups. Even so, this offensive also declared a disastrous defeat in just over a week.

Since the invading army does not have the strength to launch a full-line offensive, the three offensives launched in August and September were all focused offensives. The American aggressors attempted to break through the strong positions of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies in one area with a large number of troops and firepower, and push the front line to the Pyongyang-Wonsan line. However, under the resolute blows of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies, who were waiting in battle, this military adventure of the American aggressors was inevitably defeated.

Under the guidance of the military policy of "annihilating the enemy's effective strength," the Chinese and Korean People's Armies conducted heroic and intelligent operations against the invading aggressors, smashing the enemy's offensives time and time again, and launching fierce counterattacks against the enemy, causing the enemy to suffer unusually heavy losses. According to incomplete statistics from July 10th to October 25th, a period of three and a half months, the Chinese and Korean People's Armies annihilated more than 170,000 enemy soldiers.

However, the American aggressors have not abandoned their military adventure aimed at occupying more land in northern Korea. The invading army is still conducting frantic offensives every day. However, the difficulties of the American aggressor army have greatly increased due to the huge losses in the past period. Based on the experience of the past three months, it can be predicted that the result of all offensives by the American aggressors will be the same disastrous defeat as in the past.

### 停战谈判以来美国侵略者连续三次攻势均遭惨败  中朝部队三个半月歼敌十七万余

    停战谈判以来美国侵略者连续三次攻势均遭惨败
    中朝部队三个半月歼敌十七万余
    【新华社朝鲜前线六日电】本社前线记者报道：从七月十日停战谈判开始以来将近四个月时期中，美国侵略者不断发动疯狂进攻。其中规模较大者有三次，即：第一次在东线杨口麟蹄杆城以北地区的进攻，第二次在西线铁原西北迄高浪浦里地区的进攻，第三次在中线金化以东迄“伤心岭”地区的进攻。美国侵略者在这三次进攻中先后动用了十九个师近三十万的兵力，并且几乎全部使用了他们的炮兵和战车。
    众所周知，美国侵略者发动侵朝战争的目的，首先是灭亡全朝鲜。但从去年夏季到今年夏季的战争过程中，侵略军遭受了严重的损失；同时，世界人民要求和平解决朝鲜问题的愿望愈来愈强烈，因而美国侵略者不得不被迫于七月间接受了停战谈判的建议。虽然这样，但美国侵略者并未改变其穷凶极恶的掠夺异国土地的侵略政策，因而停战谈判期间出现了同一性质的两种情形：一是在停战谈判的会议桌上，美方不断的施行卑劣的欺诈战术，妄图不花代价地掠夺到他所要求的土地；一是在战场上，美国侵略者不顾惨重损失，不断地发动疯狂进攻，与此相配合的就是以空军滥施轰炸和扫射朝鲜北部的城镇和乡村，妄图迫使朝鲜人民在疯狂的残杀下向其屈服。所以，李奇微在停战谈判开始时就急急忙忙地宣布：在谈判协议正式签字之前，停火是不生效的。
    美国侵略者是利用停战谈判的时机来准备和发动较大规模的进攻的。在谈判开始的时候，李奇微和范佛里特相继赴前线亲自部署，尔后侵略者便一面在全线连续发动频繁地侦察性的攻击，一面就积极准备大规模的进攻。
    侵略军经过补充和调整兵力后，于八月十八日起以八个师兵力先后在东线发动疯狂进攻，其重点为杨口麟蹄以北地区。这次攻势延续到九月下旬，因遭受严重损失而宣告失败。之后，侵略军将进攻的重点移向西线，于九月二十九日在铁原西北迄高浪浦里地区发动疯狂进攻。侵略军为挽救在东线的惨败，在这次攻势中投入了五个多师的兵力，并以大量的战车飞机和几十个炮群配合作战。所以范佛里特胆敢在九月三十日发表的声明中叫嚣“联军开始秋季攻势了”。但这个攻势的第一回合经过两个星期的猛烈战斗后遭到了惨败。接着，侵略军于十月十三日又在中线东部地区发动“秋季攻势”的第二回合。在这次进攻中，范佛里特投入了四个师的兵力，并使用了更多战车飞机和炮群。即使这样，这次进攻也仅仅在一个多星期内，又宣告惨败了。
    由于侵略军没有发动全线进攻的力量，因而在八、九月间所发动的三次进攻都只是重点进攻。美国侵略者企图以众多的兵力和火器在一个地区突破中朝人民军队的坚强阵地，将战线推向平壤到元山一线。但在严阵以待的中朝人民军队的坚决打击下，美国侵略者的这个军事冒险是无可避免地失败了。
    中朝人民军队在“歼灭敌军有生力量”的军事方针的指导下，向进犯的侵略军进行英勇机智的作战，一次又一次地粉碎了敌军的进攻，并向敌军进行猛烈的反击，使敌军遭受了异乎寻常的巨大损失。据七月十日到十月二十五日三个半月不完整的统计，中朝人民军队歼敌达十七万余人。
    但是，美国侵略者并未放弃其目的在于更多地侵占朝鲜北部土地的军事冒险。侵略军仍然是每天在进行疯狂的进攻。但是，美国侵略军的困难已因过去一个时期中的巨大损失而大大增加。根据过去三个多月的经验，可以预料美国侵略者一切进攻的结果，遭到与过去同样的惨败。
