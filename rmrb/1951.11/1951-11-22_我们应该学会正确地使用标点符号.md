    We Should Learn to Use Punctuation Correctly
    Xiao Jialin
    Currently, the use of punctuation in general manuscripts and publications is quite chaotic. Some use a period only at the end of a large paragraph. Some use a question mark as long as there is an interrogative word in the sentence, regardless of whether a response is required. Some sentences don't have an exclamatory meaning but are punctuated with an exclamation mark, so when sentences with real exclamatory meaning are encountered, double (!!) or even triple exclamation marks (!!!) have to be used to express it. There are also instances of question marks and exclamation marks being used together (!?), clearly showing that the author themselves can't distinguish clearly and doesn't have a definite opinion. In terms of typesetting, symbols that should not be separated from the statement are often placed at the top of a line. Some authors also do this in their handwritten manuscripts.
    Punctuation is an organic component of an article. We are now required to correctly use the language of the motherland to write articles, and such chaotic phenomena cannot be tolerated. Therefore, the publication of the "Usage of Punctuation Marks" by the General Administration of Publications in the "People's Daily" on September 26th is of great significance.
    The "Usage of Punctuation Marks" published by the General Administration of Publications has three characteristics:
    First, it divides punctuation marks into two categories: one is derived from language, and the other is entirely a written convention. It points out that seven symbols, including the period, comma, and enumeration comma, are not just written conventions but are derived from language. Combining the use of punctuation marks with the rules of language is a first. In the past, discussions of punctuation marks generally started from the written form, making people feel that punctuation marks were merely an adjunct to the article, and since they were adjuncts, what harm was there in being careless? Many people don't pay attention to punctuation marks because they have this mentality. The chaotic use of punctuation marks stems from this. The "Usage of Punctuation Marks" points out that seven symbols, including the period, comma, and enumeration comma, are derived from language and are originally organic components of the language, not adjuncts to the article. Only when everyone recognizes this point and corrects past misconceptions will they pay attention to punctuation marks and use them conscientiously.
    Second, it points out that seven symbols, including the period, comma, and enumeration comma, represent various pauses in language. A pause is a temporary cessation of speaking, but it is closely related to the spoken part. The meaning, organization, and mood of the language become clear through pauses. Language that continues uninterrupted is impossible for people to understand. Therefore, when writing articles, it is necessary to correctly use seven symbols, including the period, comma, and enumeration comma, to represent the various pauses in the language, so that readers can understand the author's original intention without any distortion. At the same time, this realizes the principle of consistency between writing and speaking.
    Third, it stipulates the format for punctuation marks in typesetting and writing. In the past, discussions of punctuation marks generally never paid attention to this point.
    The "Usage of Punctuation Marks" has the above three characteristics, so it is of great help to authors, readers, and publishers. Authors can use the seven symbols based on the various pauses in the language, which is not only convenient but also reduces errors. After becoming proficient, they can also use the punctuation marks to check whether their sentences are tight enough. Loose sentences are loose language. When using punctuation marks and feeling a little hesitant, repeating it verbally will reveal the loose parts. The initial hesitation is due to not saying the language correctly. For readers, relying on knowledge of punctuation mark usage allows for a deeper understanding of the article, and for the author, it's as if they hear their voice and see their heart—that, of course, refers to articles that correctly use punctuation marks. For publishers, having a standard to follow for punctuation marks in typesetting will not only make their publications neat and beautiful but also provide practical benefits to the reading public.
    In order to respond to the call of the "People's Daily" editorial on June 6th, "Correctly Use the Language of the Motherland, and Fight for the Purity and Health of the Language," various sectors are launching language learning movements. A part of punctuation marks is derived from language, and even the other part is an organic component of the article. Therefore, we should include the "Usage of Punctuation Marks" in the directory of language learning materials, and we should learn to use punctuation correctly.

    我们应该学会正确地使用标点符号
    萧家霖
    目前一般文稿和书刊上的标点符号用得相当混乱。有只在一大段文章的末了用个句号的。有不管要不要人家回答，只要句子里有个疑问词就用上问号的。有的句子并没有感叹的意味，却用上了感叹号，待遇到真有感叹意味的句子，只好用双料的
    （！！）甚至三重的感叹号（！！！）来表示。还有问号和感叹号并用的（！？），显见作者自己也辨别不清，没有一定的主张。在排版方面，常把不该和语句分开的符号放在一行的顶上。有些作者的手写稿也那么办。
    标点符号是文章的有机成分。我们正要求正确地运用祖国的语言来写文章，那样的混乱现象是决不容许存在的。因此，九月二十六日“人民日报”刊载了出版总署公布的“标点符号用法”，有很重要的意义。
    出版总署公布的“标点符号用法”有三个特点：
    第一、它把标点符号分成两类，一类是根据语言而来的，一类是完全属于书面的东西。它指出句号、逗号、顿号等七种符号并非只是书面的东西，而是根据语言而来的。把标点符号的用法和语言的规律结合起来，这还是头一回。过去一般讲标点符号的都只从书面出发，让人觉得标点符号不过是文章的附加品，既然是附加品，何妨马虎一点。许多人不重视标点符号，就因为存着这样的心理。标点符号用得相当混乱，原因也就在此。“标点符号用法”指出了句号、逗号、顿号等七种符号是根据语言而来的，原是语言的有机成分，并非文章的附加品。大家认清了这一点，纠正了过去的错误想法，才会重视标点符号，认真地使用标点符号。
    第二、它指出句号、逗号、顿号等七种符号表示语言的种种停顿。停顿就是暂时不说下去，却和说的部分密切相关。语言的意义、组织、情态，靠了停顿才见得显明。一连串说下去、绝不停顿的语言是没法叫人领会的。所以，写文章的时候，必须正确地使用句号、逗号、顿号等七种符号来表示语言的种种停顿，才可以让读者一点不走样地了解作者的原意。同时，这才实现了写文章和说话一致的原则。
    第三、它规定了标点符号在排版、书写方面的格式。对于这一点，过去一般讲标点符号的从来没有注意过。
    “标点符号用法”有上述三个特点，所以对于作者、读者、出版者都有很大的帮助。作者根据语言的种种停顿来使用那七种符号，非但方便，并且可以减少错误。用得熟练之后，还可以凭使用标点符号来检查自己的文句够不够严密。不严密的文句就是不严密的语言。在使用标点符号的时候，觉得有点踌躇，再在嘴上说一遍，就把不严密的地方检查出来了。当初的踌躇就由于语言没有说对。就读者说，依靠标点符号用法的知识，对于文章可以理解得更深切，对于作者，如闻其声，如见其心——那当然指正确地使用标点符号的文章而言。就出版家说，标点符号在排版方面有了可以依据的规格，他们的出版物不但整齐美观，而且使读者群众受到实际的好处。
    为了响应六月六日“人民日报”社论“正确地使用祖国的语言，为语言的纯洁和健康而斗争”的号召，各方面正在展开语文学习的运动。标点符号的
    一部分是根据语言而来的，就是另外一部分也是文章的有机成分。因此，我们应该把“标点符号用法”列入语文学习资料的目录，我们应该学会正确地使用标点符号。
