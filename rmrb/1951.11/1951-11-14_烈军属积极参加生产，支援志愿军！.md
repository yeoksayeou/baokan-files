    Dependents of Revolutionary Martyrs Actively Participate in Production to Support the Volunteer Army!
    Volunteer Army Comrades, We are Working Hard to Increase Production in the Rear to Support You

    Heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army Comrades: On the anniversary of your departure to fight abroad, we respectfully report to you on the production work of military dependents in our district.
    In order to implement the principle of "focusing on production" and solve the living problems of the families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, and disabled revolutionary soldiers, we have established ten military dependents' factories under the leadership of the district government. Nearly six hundred military dependents in the district have become regular workers in the military dependents' factories, which not only solves the family's living difficulties but also adds a lot of wealth to the motherland.
    In the great patriotic movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, your heroic victories in annihilating the enemy have been frequently reported from the front, which has greatly encouraged our production enthusiasm. A warm production competition movement has been launched in the whole factory, production management has been improved, and the working system has been improved, and production efficiency and product quality have been improved accordingly. This year, our original plan was to achieve a production value of 600,000 catties of millet, and by the end of September, we had overfulfilled it by 902,470 catties. New achievements are constantly emerging. Recently, the sputum boxes for tuberculosis patients entrusted by the Daoji Tuberculosis Sanatorium of Beijing have been successfully trial-produced thanks to the research and design of technician Liu Jingquan and the tailoring of the female workers. After being put into water, it can be leakproof for ten hours. At present, we are planning to produce them in large quantities for other tuberculosis hospitals.
    In addition, many military dependents are actively learning technology, preparing to join the military dependents' factory in the future. Ten students in the clothing factory's technical training class learned relatively complex techniques such as overlocking in less than a month. When each worker in the weaving factory goes to work, they adopt the method of "mentoring apprentices" to facilitate their quick mastery of technology and take up jobs.
    Heroic Volunteer Army Comrades! Your families are working, studying, and living happily in the rear. Continue to annihilate the enemy in large numbers! If American imperialism sabotages the armistice negotiations and launches a new war of aggression, eliminate it! We are determined to support you with practical actions.

    My Mother-in-Law and I Made a Production Increase Plan to Support Our Nephew and Son-in-Law on the Korean Front

    After the liberation of Hunan, my two nephews joined the army and left. My daughter went to military supplies school and wrote to say that they were living well. We are also living well at home.
    This year, in the land reform, I was given land and a house, and I also built a new cowshed and painted the lintel, and my home looks like something. The evil landlords who used to ride on our heads and do all kinds of evil deeds have been overthrown by us; I personally participated in such struggles, how can I not be happy!
    After the land reform was completed, we held a turn-over celebration. That day, cadres and more than 100 neighbors came to my house, they performed Yangko dances and gave us honorary flowers, and they kept saying that we were glorious military dependents. My mother-in-law smiled so hard that she couldn't close her mouth. Later, gifts and letters of condolence were sent to us during every festival. Life is good and glorious. My daughters are studying and have joined the Youth League, so I no longer worry about them. I wrote to my daughters and told them to listen carefully to what Chairman Mao said and to do things for the people.
    The township launched the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea. We publicized the significance of Resisting America and Aid Korea, so that even three-year-old children knew that the American devils were following the old path of the Japanese devils; in order to protect our good life, we must Resist America and Aid Korea. We made a patriotic agreement to increase production. Everyone fertilized the fields, applied lime, and saved cotton to sell to the state. My patriotic production increase plan has been fulfilled: I paid for planes and artillery grain; I took my share of the preferential grain for military dependents to support my two nephews and son-in-law in Korea, so that they could eat better; my mother-in-law is making military shoes and sock bottoms, sewing them with dense stitches, so that the children can wear them firmly and fight the American devils well. When the devils are defeated, life will be better!

    I Will Work Harder to Produce Support for the Volunteer Army to Avenge My Son, Martyr Wang Jingzhou

    Dear Volunteer Army Family Members: You may not know who I am. I am Wang Jingzhou's father. According to the old society's saying: "Raise children to prevent old age, save grain to prevent hunger", I want my children to revolve around me all day long, and I feel a little uneasy if they leave too far away. Today, we have our own country, and the people are the masters. With such a country, we have a harmonious home. Jingzhou is not just my child, he has become the child of the country. He joined the People's Railway work, and I never held him back. In his work, he received the education of the Communist Party and became a glorious Communist Party member, and his work became more and more vigorous. Last November, he was the first to sign up to join the Chinese Railway Workers Volunteer Aid Korea Brigade. He has gloriously sacrificed. Everyone says: "Wang Jingzhou is a good son of the Communist Party", and I also patted my chest and said: "Jingzhou, who sacrificed to defend the motherland, is my good son." I am the father of a martyr who resisted America and aided Korea, and I feel so honored in my heart!
    Originally, in order to defend our country and our home, my son's sacrifice is nothing, but our government often comes to comfort me, giving me 120,000 yuan every month, and thinking of many ways to take care of my family's life. I am old, but I still have a lot of energy to produce. Jingzhou's wife also said: "I am very young, I should inherit his glory, actively participate in production, and not rely on the government's help." My whole family is now organized, working hard to reduce the government's burden. This year, we guarantee to harvest and thresh first, thresh the grain, select the good ones, and hand them over to the state. In addition, we must educate my sons well and make them all heroes who defend the motherland and avenge all the martyrs and Jingzhou.

    The People's Government Helped Me Cure My Illness
    I Want to Encourage My Son to Work Harder to Kill the Enemy

    My son, Dong Guangcheng, is a soldier in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and is now in Korea. I work in the military dependents' factory in the Third District of Beijing. I became ill due to overwork. I was introduced by the Thirteenth Police Station of this district for free treatment. It didn't get better, so I asked Chinese medicine doctor Xi Peiling to diagnose and treat me. After taking a few doses of Chinese medicine, I got better. Although the medicine fee was given a 30% discount, I was still unable to repay it. Representative Yang sincerely reflected this to the District People's Government, and the District People's Government has issued 60,000 yuan for the medicine fee. The Third District People's Government has repeatedly taken care of military dependents, which makes me very grateful. I will definitely step up production in the future and write to my son Guangcheng in Korea, encouraging him to work hard, kill the enemy, and make meritorious service to repay the kindness of the People's Government.

    烈军属积极参加生产，支援志愿军！
　　志愿军同志们，我们在后方努力增产支援你们
    英勇的中国人民志愿军同志们：在你们出国作战一周年的时候，我们谨向你们报告我区军属生产工作的情况。
    为了贯彻“以生产为主”的方针，解决烈、军属及革命残废军人的生活问题，我们在区政府的领导下，建立了十个军属工厂。全区将近六百名军属都成了军属工厂的经常劳动者，不但解决了家庭的生活困难，并为祖国增添了不少财富。
    在伟大的抗美援朝爱国主义运动中，你们英勇歼敌的捷报从前方频频传来，这大大地鼓舞了我们的生产热情。全厂展开了热烈的生产竞赛运动，改进了生产管理，健全了工作制度，生产效率和产品质量都随着提高。今年，我们原计划达到价值六十万斤小米的生产额，到九月底已超额完成了九十万二千四百七十斤。新的成绩，还在不断地涌现着。最近，北京市道济医院结核病疗养院委托制造的结核病用痰盒，由于技工刘景泉同志的研究设计和女工们的裁剪，试制成功了。放入水后，可以十时不漏。目前，我们正计划大量制作，供其他结核病院使用。
    另外，很多军属都在积极地学习着技术，准备将来加入军属工厂工作。被服厂技术学习班有十名学员还不到一个月，即学会了包缝等比较复杂的技术。织布厂每个工人上班时，都采用了“带徒弟”的办法，便于他们很快地掌握技术，走上工作岗位。
    英勇的志愿军同志们！你们的家属在后方是这样愉快地工作、学习与生活着。继续大量地歼灭敌人吧！美帝国主义如破坏停战谈判，发动新的侵略战争，就消灭它！我们决以实际行动来支援你们。

    我和婆婆订了增产计划，支援在朝鲜前线的侄儿和女婿
    湖南解放后，我的两个侄儿参军走了。女儿进了军需学校，来信说，她们生活得很好。我们在家里，生活得也很好。
    今年土地改革，我分到了田地、房子，还搭了新牛栏，粉刷了门楣，家里像个样子。过去骑在我们头上、无恶不作的恶霸地主都被我们斗倒了；我亲自参加了这样的斗争，那能不高兴！
    土地改革完成后，我们开了翻身大会。那天，干部和邻舍一百多人到我家来，他们扭秧歌，送光荣花给我们，开口闭口都说我们是光荣军属。婆婆笑得口都合不拢来。后来，每逢过节，都送礼物，慰问信给我们。日子好过，又光荣。女儿们在学习，都入了青年团，我再不挂念她们。我写信告诉女儿们，好好听毛主席的话，发狠为人民做事情。
    乡里开展了抗美援朝运动。我们宣传抗美援朝的意义，使三岁小孩都知道美国鬼子正走日本鬼子的老路；为了保住好日子，就要抗美援朝。我们订立了增产爱国公约。大家把田里加了肥，打了石灰，存棉卖给国家。我的爱国增产计划做到了：缴了飞机大炮粮；把我的一份军属优待粮，拿去支援我在朝鲜的两个侄儿和女婿，让他们吃得更饱些；婆婆在做军鞋袜底，密针密线地缝，让孩子们穿得牢，好打美国鬼子。鬼子打完了，日子就更好过了！

    我要更加努力生产支援志愿军为我儿王景洲烈士报仇
    亲爱的志愿军家属：你们或许不知道我是谁。我就是王景洲的爸爸。要按旧社会的说法：“养儿防老，积谷防饥”，叫自己的孩子整天围着自己打转转，离开远一点，就有点不放心。今天，有了自己的国家，人民当了主人。有了这样的国，才有我们和乐的家。景洲不是我一个人的孩子，已经成为国家的孩子了。他参加人民铁道工作，我从不扯他的腿。在工作中，接受了共产党的教育，变成了光荣的共产党员，工作做得一天比一天起劲。去年十一月，他又第一批报名参加了中国铁路工人志愿援朝大队。他已光荣地牺牲了。人人都说：“王景洲是共产党的好儿子”，我也拍拍胸脯说：“为了保卫祖国而牺牲的景洲，才是我的好儿子。”我是抗美援朝烈士的爸爸，我心里觉得太光荣啦！
    本来，为了保卫咱们的国和咱们的家，儿子牺牲算不了啥，可是咱们的政府还常常来安慰我，每月发给十二万元，想出许多办法来照顾我全家的生活。我年纪大了，但生产起来还有一股劲。景洲的妻子也这么说：“我很年轻，应该继承他的光荣，积极参加生产，不依赖政府的帮助。”我全家现在都组织起来，努力干活，减轻政府的负担。今年保证先割先打，打下粮食，选出好的，缴给国家。另外，要好好教育我的儿子，叫他们都成为保卫祖国的英雄，为所有的烈士和景洲报仇。

    人民政府帮助我治好了病
    我要鼓励儿子更努力杀敌
    我的儿子董光柽是中国人民志愿军，现在在朝鲜。我在北京第三区军属工厂作工，因为劳累过度，而致患病，经本区十三派出所介绍免费治疗，没有好，又请中医师郗霈龄诊治，吃了几付中药，病才好了。虽然药费按七折优待，但我仍然无力偿还，承热诚的杨代表反映到区人民政府，已由区人民政府发给药费六万元。第三区人民政府对军属一再照顾，使我万分感激，我今后一定加紧生产，并给在朝鲜的我儿光柽去信，鼓励他努力工作，杀敌立功，以报答人民政府的厚意。
