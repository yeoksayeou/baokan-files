　　After Visiting the Northeast Materials Exchange Exhibition
    I am Even More Determined to Learn Technology to Defend the Motherland
    Editor: I visited the "Northeast Materials Exchange Exhibition," and from this exhibition, it can be seen that the living standards of the people in the Northeast are constantly rising, and therefore, their purchasing power has also greatly increased. Taking rice as an example, it has increased fivefold compared to 1949; pork has increased by 67 percent. In terms of industrial production, factories in the Northeast have manufactured many advanced agricultural tools, and agricultural machines such as tractors have already begun to be used in some rural areas. For example, the electric rice milling machines manufactured by the workers can mill 35,000 to 40,000 jin in twenty hours. All these brilliant achievements make me feel excited and encouraged. It makes me further realize the loveliness of our great motherland and the beautiful and happy future. Therefore, I must learn technology well and return to the Korean front line to defend our great motherland with practical actions to stop the US imperialists from expanding the war of aggression.

　　参观东北物资交流展览会后
    我更要学好技术保卫祖国
    编辑同志：我参观了“东北物资交流展览大会”，从这个展览会里可以看出东北人民的生活水准在不断上升，因而购买力亦大大提高。仅以大米来说，就比一九四九年增加了五倍；猪肉增加了百分之六十七。在工业生产方面，东北的工厂制造了不少先进的农具，像拖拉机等农业机器已经开始在某些农村中使用。又如工人们制造的电力碾米机，在二十小时内，就可碾三万五千斤到四万斤。所有这些辉煌的成就，都使我感到兴奋和鼓舞，它使我更进一步认识到我们伟大祖国的可爱和幸福美丽的远景。因此，我一定要学好技术，再回朝鲜前线，用制止美帝国主义扩大侵略战争的实际行动，来保卫我们伟大的祖国。
