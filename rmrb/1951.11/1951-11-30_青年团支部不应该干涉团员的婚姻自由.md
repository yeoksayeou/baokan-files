    Youth League Branch Should Not Interfere with Members' Freedom of Marriage
    Dong Guiying
    I am a female member of the New Democratic Youth League. My parents' home is in Dahongmen Village, District 11, Beijing. In 1949, my parents arranged for me to marry Du Wenqing from Shicun in the same district. Before the marriage, I firmly expressed my disagreement to marry Du Wenqing, because I was afraid of following my sister's tragic path. My sister was married off by my parents at the age of fifteen. The couple's relationship was not harmonious, and she was often beaten and scolded by her husband, and eventually tortured to death.
    Now I have been married for nearly two years, and I have not had a single day of peace of mind, but I have not dared to think about divorcing Du Wenqing.
    From the winter of 1949 to the spring of 1950, I actively participated in the land reform movement. Soon after, I joined the New Democratic Youth League. Later, after studying at the district Youth League Working Committee training class, I clearly understood the harm of the feudal marriage system and knew that freedom of marriage was protected by the government. So in July of this year, I formally proposed to divorce Du Wenqing. Unexpectedly, I immediately encountered opposition from all sides in the village. Even the village cadres said, "You don't have enough grounds for divorce. You don't lack food or clothing, what are you divorcing for!" They also said, "If everyone in the village was like you, we wouldn't have to work." Some people also said, "Women like her should be beaten, just lock her up for a few days." But I didn't bow to them, I insisted on asking for a divorce. Finally, on October 20, the People's Court ruled for divorce.
    When I filed for divorce, I was seriously obstructed by the comrades of the Shicun Youth League branch. As soon as they heard that I wanted a divorce, they started making a fuss. Sun Yanshou, the leader of the Youth League group, said, "The Youth League plays a leading role. If she makes trouble like this with divorce, people will say 'Your Youth League is leading the way in divorce,' who will join our Youth League in the future?" Yu Dejiang, the secretary of the Youth League branch, even convened a Youth League branch meeting specifically for this matter. He questioned me, "What are your grounds for divorce? Du Wenqing's family has food and drink, he doesn't hit or scold you, and when you went to the district Youth League Working Committee training class, he even sent you money, what do you want?" He also said, "You don't even produce well yourself and you want a divorce!" They didn't even ask me why I wasn't producing well, and just blamed me all the time. Seeing that I couldn't explain it clearly, I didn't say a word. Later, they held two more Youth League branch committee meetings to "educate" me, continuing to persuade me not to divorce. Their reason was: "Divorce has a bad influence." Later, after the comrades of the district Youth League Working Committee educated them, they only superficially agreed to my divorce.
    The Shicun Youth League branch is very good in other work, but they just can't stand divorce and free love. Because Shao Shihua, the deputy secretary of the Youth League in the village, once asked the female League member Ma Kuiying to help him cut some clothes, some Youth League members made a fuss, and even criticized Shao Shihua at the meeting. Another time, Shao Shihua helped the female League member Yan Shuqin's family pull a cart of soil, and the League branch committee held meeting after meeting to criticize Shao Shihua. In the end, Shao Shihua was brought to tears, and Shao's mother was also brought to tears, feeling that life was unbearable. The Shicun Youth League branch is like this, it doesn't allow divorce, it doesn't allow love, and it doesn't allow male and female League members to talk freely.
    After my divorce, my Youth League organizational relationship had to be transferred to the Dahongmen Village Youth League branch. This also encountered many difficulties. Xiao Xuezhen, the organizational committee member of the Dahongmen Village Youth League branch, heard that I was divorced and wanted to come to Dahongmen, and said, "We can't have this kind of League member who makes trouble with divorce in our League. Many of the female League members in our League are married, is she going to lead us to divorce?" She also convened a special Youth League branch meeting to discuss whether to accept me as a League member. Under her leadership, feudal ideology occupied a dominant position in the League. One female League member said, "Oh, how did all the scrap metal come to us!" Some said, "She just got divorced, isn't she going to damage our League's reputation by coming here?" Xiao Xuezhen said, "Yes, if she comes, and causes our League to become detached from the masses, how will the League members carry out their work in the future?" After this meeting, Xiao Xuezhen ran to the district Youth League Working Committee to oppose the transfer of my League organizational relationship to Dahongmen. Xiao said to the comrades of the district Youth League Working Committee, "The female League members in our village are very feudal, if Dong Guiying comes, what will we do if the female League members don't attend the League meetings?" Later, after the district Youth League Working Committee explained and educated her, she still didn't understand. She said, "Just transfer the relationship then, but we must transform her well in the future." On the day I arrived at the Dahongmen Youth League branch, Xiao had a private talk with me. She said, "Your divorce has had a very bad influence, you must transform yourself well in the future."
    I really don't know how my divorce could have made them "lose face"? Why do the Youth League branches in these two villages treat me, a young woman who has just stood up from the oppression of the feudal marriage system, like this? They even considered whether to accept me as a Youth League member, and convened special meetings to study this. Why don't they hold a meeting for those young women who are still oppressed and abused to discuss how to help them stand up? Li Xiuying, the daughter-in-law of the Dahongmen Village head, is a Youth League member, but she is controlled by her family and cannot attend League meetings; female Youth League member Yang Shuzhen is also controlled by her father-in-law and cannot participate in various League activities. Why don't they hold special meetings to discuss these issues? I don't understand, does a woman who is oppressed by the feudal marriage system lose her right to divorce after joining the Youth League? Should Youth League members' marriages be arranged by their parents? Should Youth League members become "models" who obey the feudal marriage system and do not resist at all, or should they become models of resisting the feudal marriage system? The cadres say that my divorce has a bad influence on the masses, I don't understand whether our Youth League members should use the spirit of resisting the feudal marriage system to influence the masses, or should they follow behind certain masses who are bound by feudal ideas? In a word, I don't understand why the Youth League organizations in these two villages must interfere with the freedom of marriage of League members.

    青年团支部不应该干涉团员的婚姻自由
    董桂英
    我是一个新民主主义青年团的女团员，我的娘家在北京市第十一区大红门村。一九四九年由父母包办和本区时村杜文清结婚。结婚以前，我曾经坚决表示不同意和杜文清结婚，因为我怕走了姐姐的悲惨道路。我姐姐十五岁那年，就由父母包办嫁了出去。夫妇感情不合，她经常受丈夫打骂，最后活活被折磨死了。
    现在我结婚将近两年了，没有过一天舒心的日子，但是也没有敢想和杜文清离婚。
    一九四九年冬天到一九五○年春天，我积极参加了土地改革运动。不久参加了新民主主义青年团。以后经过在区团工委训练班的学习，我清楚地认识了封建婚姻制度的害处，知道了婚姻自由是受政府保护的。于是在今年七月里正式提出和杜文清离婚。想不到，我马上遭到村里各方面的反对。连村干部也说：“你离婚不够条件。不缺吃，不缺穿，离什么婚哪！”他们还说：“村里人要都像你这样，我们就不用工作了。”还有人说：“像她这样的妇女就是该打，先押她几天就好了。”但是我没有向他们低头，我坚持要求离婚。最后终于在十月二十日由人民法院判决离婚了。
    在我提出离婚时，受到时村青年团支部同志的严重阻挠。他们一听说我要离婚，就吵嚷起来了。团的小组长孙延寿说：“青年团是起带头作用的。她这样闹离婚，叫群众说‘你们青年团就是带头离婚’，以后谁还参加咱们的青年团呢？”青年团支部书记于德江还专为此事召开青年团支部会议，他质问我：“你离婚有什么条件？人家杜文清家有吃有喝，不打不骂，你到区团工委训练班学习时，人家还给你送钱，你要怎么样？”又说：“你自己不好好生产还要离婚哩！”他们也不问我为什么不好好生产，就一股劲责怪我。我看见说不清楚，就一声不哼。以后又开过两次青年团支委会来“教育”我，继续劝我不要离婚。他们的理由是：“离婚影响不好。”后来经过区团工委的同志对他们进行教育，他们才在表面上同意我离婚。
    时村青年团支部在其他工作上是很好的，就是看不惯离婚，看不惯自由恋爱。该村青年团副支书邵世华因为有一次请女团员马魁英帮忙裁了裁衣服，有些青年团员就起哄，在会议上还批评邵世华。又一次邵世华帮助女团员阎淑琴家拉了一车土，团支委就一次一次地召开会议批评邵世华。最后把邵世华气哭了，邵的母亲也气哭了，觉得日子没法过下去。时村的团支部就是这样，不准离婚，不准恋爱，也不准男女团员自由说话。
    我离婚以后，团的组织关系要转到大红门村团支部去。这也遇到了很多困难。大红门村团支部组织委员萧学珍听说我离婚后要到大红门来，就说：“我们团里不能要这种闹离婚的团员。我们团里的女团员很多是结了婚的，叫她来领导我们离婚吗？”她并且专门召开团支部会，讨论要不要我这个团员的问题。在她的领导下，封建思想在团里占了统治地位。有一个女团员说：“哟，怎么碎铜烂铁的都到我们这里来啦！”有的说：“她刚离了婚，来我们这里不是破坏我们团的名誉吗？”萧学珍说：“是啊，她要来了，把我们团闹得脱离了群众，以后团员怎样进行工作？”这次会议以后，萧学珍又跑到区团工委会去，反对把我的团组织关系转到大红门去。萧对区团工委会的同志说：“我们村的女团员都很封建，董桂英来了，女团员都不参加团的会议怎么办？”后来经过区团工委的解释教育，她的思想还是不通。她说：“关系转来就转来吧，以后要好好改造她。”我到大红门团支部的当天，萧就同我作了个别谈话。她说：“你闹离婚闹得影响很坏，你今后一定要好好改造自己。”
    我真不知道我的离婚怎么就会丢了他们的“脸”？为什么这两个村的团支部这样对待我这个刚刚从封建婚姻制度压迫下站起来的青年妇女？他们甚至考虑要不要我这个青年团员，并且为这专门召开会议，进行研究。他们为什么不为那些还在受压迫、受虐待的青年妇女开一次会，讨论讨论怎样帮助她们站起来？大红门村村长的儿媳妇李秀英是一个青年团员，被家里管着不能参加团的会议；女青年团员杨淑珍也被她的公公管着，不能参加团的各种活动。对这些问题，他们为什么不专门开会讨论讨论呢？我不明白，一个在封建婚姻制度压迫下的妇女参加了青年团以后，是不是就不能离婚了呢？青年团员的婚姻是不是一定要由父母包办呢？青年团员应该成为服从封建婚姻制度而一点不反抗的“模范”呢，还是应该成为反抗封建婚姻制度的模范呢？干部们说我闹离婚闹得群众影响不好，我不明白我们青年团员是应该用反抗封建婚姻制度的精神去影响群众，还是应该跟着某些受封建思想束缚的群众做尾巴呢？一句话，我不明白这两个村的青年团组织究竟为什么一定要干涉团员的婚姻自由。
