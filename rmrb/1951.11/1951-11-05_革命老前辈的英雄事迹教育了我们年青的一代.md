    The heroic deeds of veteran revolutionaries educate our younger generation
    Comrade Editor: The representatives from the old revolutionary base areas in the South who attended the National Day celebrations told us many stories of revolutionary struggle, which deeply educated us.
    Liu Xinsen, a revolutionary hero from Jinggang Mountain in Jiangxi Province, is sixty-three years old this year. He joined the revolution early and worked directly under the leadership of Chairman Mao for many years. Later, because of the enemy's "encirclement and suppression," he was forced by the enemy into the deep mountains, living in mountain caves, eating wild grass, overcoming all difficulties, and constantly fighting against the enemy until the victory of the Liberation War. Liao Decai, another revolutionary hero on Jinggang Mountain, was captured during the enemy's "encirclement and suppression." The enemy used all kinds of cruel tortures to force him to confess, but they still could not extract a single word from his mouth! Later, Comrade Liao Decai returned to the ranks of the people. When Comrade Liao Decai told us these past events, his eyes radiated with hatred. He unbuttoned his clothes and showed us the large scars on his back. Many students were so moved that they shed tears. Comrade Liao Decai said to us in a firm tone: "The enemy's brutality cannot conquer us. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we finally achieved today's victory!"
    The heroic deeds have educated our younger generation and strengthened our fighting will in future study and work.

    革命老前辈的英雄事迹教育了我们年青的一代
    编辑同志：参加国庆观礼的南方老根据地的代表们，给我们讲了许多革命斗争的故事，深深地教育了我们。
    江西井冈山的革命老英雄柳辛森，今年六十三岁了。他早就参加了革命，在毛主席直接领导下工作了许多年。后来因为敌人的“围剿”，他被敌人逼到深山里，住着山洞，吃着野草，克服一切困难，不断地和敌人进行斗争，直到解放战争的胜利。同在井冈山上的另一位革命英雄廖德材，在敌人“围剿”时期被捕了。敌人用尽了一切毒刑逼他招口供，但仍不能从他嘴里逼出半个字来！后来，廖德材同志又回到人民的队伍。廖德材同志和我们讲述这些往事时，他的眼里放射着愤恨的光。他解开衣服，给我们看他背上大块的伤痕。许多同学激动得掉下泪来。廖德材同志用坚毅的口吻对我们说：“敌人的残暴，并不能征服我们，在党和毛主席的领导下，我们终于取得了今天的胜利！”
    英雄的事迹教育了我们年轻的一代，加强了我们今后在学习和工作中的斗争意志。
