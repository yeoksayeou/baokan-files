    I want to encourage my beloved to bravely kill the enemy on the Korean front – After reading the article “Accuse the American Murderers!”
    To the Editor: After seeing the photos of the atrocities of American imperialism in Korea published in the People's Daily on the 15th of this month, I was so angry that my heart almost burst! These conscienceless and inhuman beasts are using all kinds of brutal means to slaughter the peaceful people of our brother country, Korea. However, we firmly believe that this barbaric atrocity will absolutely not intimidate the Korean people who are fighting for justice and freedom. On the contrary, it will only strengthen the Korean people's determination to step up the fight and strive for the complete liberation of their motherland. At the same time, the atrocities of the United States will make the people of the world see more clearly the vicious and brutal face of American imperialism.
    Because of my work, I cannot personally go to Korea to fight the American devils, but I will write to my beloved (who joined the Chinese People's Volunteers) to encourage him to bravely kill the enemy on the front line and avenge the Korean people. At the same time, I myself will work hard in the rear, respond to Chairman Mao's call, and support the Korean front with increased production and savings!

    我要鼓励爱人在朝鲜前线勇敢杀敌
    “控告美国杀人犯！”一文读后
    编辑同志：看了本月十五日人民日报刊登的美帝国主义在朝鲜暴行的照片后，我气得心都要崩裂啦！这些丧尽天良没有人性的野兽们，用种种惨无人道的手段来屠杀我们的兄弟国家朝鲜的和平人民。但是我们深信这种野蛮的兽行绝对不能吓倒为正义与自由而战的朝鲜人民，相反的却只能加强朝鲜人民加紧战斗、争取祖国彻底解放的决心。同时，美国的暴行将使全世界人民更清楚地看到美帝国主义这种凶恶残暴的面貌。
    我因为工作需要不能亲自到朝鲜去打击美国鬼子，但我要一方面写信给我的爱人（他参加了中国人民志愿军），鼓励他在前线勇敢杀敌，为朝鲜人民报仇；一方面我自己要在后方努力工作，响应毛主席的号召，用增产节约的行动来支援朝鲜前线！
