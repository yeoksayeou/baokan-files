To the Beijing Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference:

    I deeply thank the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference for the battle encouragement in congratulating the Korean people's Fatherland Liberation War on the occasion of the first anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers entering Korea to fight. The outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people—the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers—together with the Korean people, have achieved great accomplishments in the just struggle against the common enemy of the Korean and Chinese peoples, the American imperialist aggressors, and have victoriously accomplished the glorious mission entrusted to them by the Chinese people.

    The fraternal friendship and solidarity between our two countries, Korea and China, forged in blood in the struggle against the common enemy, will be further consolidated in the future.

    The Korean People's Army, receiving the combat assistance of the Chinese People's Volunteers, will surely defend its own unification and independence, and make further contributions to the cause of safeguarding the security and peace of the people of Asian countries.

    I sincerely wish the great Chinese people greater achievements in the future struggle for the prosperity and development of their own country and for lasting world peace.

    Commander-in-Chief of the Korean People's Army Kim Il Sung
    November 1, 1951, Pyongyang
