    Xinhua News Agency, 21st: Ridgway Headquarters issued another shameless statement on the 20th, attempting to cover up the exposed lie about "killing prisoners." The statement had to admit that there was "no conclusive evidence" of the alleged killing of prisoners, but the statement shamelessly said that "a considerable amount of evidence is sufficient to assume that a large number of people were tortured to death." This complete fabrication by Ridgway Headquarters is not even believed by the U.S. soldiers and officers.

    According to a Tokyo dispatch from the United Press International on the 20th, officers at Ridgway Headquarters in Tokyo believe that Hanley's fabricated lies are "irresponsible." "A most common opinion is that much of Hanley's evidence is untenable. But this opinion is not allowed to be published."

    U.S. soldiers and officers at the front have further exposed Hanley's lies. A UPI dispatch said: "A Marine officer who frequently travels between the 1st Marine Division headquarters and the front line said that he has never seen any evidence that the Chinese have committed any atrocities against prisoners of war. ... The officer stated bluntly that he does not believe Hanley's accusations. ... He said that according to Hanley, 200 Marine prisoners of war were massacred, but the 1st Marine Division headquarters has never issued such a message, nor has it ever provided evidence. He added: Some Marine prisoners of war have been released and returned, and some have escaped after being captured. None of them have ever said that the Chinese have committed atrocities against American prisoners of war."

    The UPI dispatch also said: American soldiers at the front are "more skeptical" of Hanley's lies than officers. One "soldier who has been fighting on the front line since the beginning of the Korean War said that he has never heard of any atrocities committed by the Chinese, and no matter what Hanley says, he can never believe it."

### 美方关于我军“杀害俘虏”的谎言  美军官兵都不相信

    美方关于我军“杀害俘虏”的谎言
    美军官兵都不相信
        【新华社二十一日讯】李奇微总部在二十日晚又发表无耻声明，企图为已被揭穿的“杀害俘虏”的谎言作掩饰。声明不得不承认，所谓杀害俘虏并“没有确凿的证据”，但是声明又无赖地说“有相当多的证据足以假定有一大部分人被虐杀。”李奇微总部这种彻头彻尾的捏造，甚至美军的官兵们也完全不相信。
    据美国国际新闻社东京二十日电讯说：东京李奇微总部的军官们认为汉莱所捏造的谎言“是不负责任的”。“一种最普遍的意见是，汉莱的许多证据都是不能成立的。但这种意见没有准许发表”。
    在前线的美军官兵更揭破了汉莱的谎言。国新社的消息说：“一个经常往来于海军陆战队第一师师部和战线间的陆战队军官说，他从来没有看见过一点证据表明中国人对战俘有任何暴行。……那个军官直截了当地说，他不相信汉莱的攻击。……他说，据汉莱说，有二百名海军陆战队战俘被屠杀，可是海军陆战队第一师师部从来不曾发表过这样的消息，也从来不曾提供过证据。他又说：有一些海军陆战队的战俘被释放回来，有一些被俘后逃了回来，他们当中从来没有人说到中国人对美国战俘有暴虐行为。”
    国新社的消息并说：在前线的美国士兵们对汉莱的谎言比军官们“更表怀疑”。有一个“从朝鲜战争一开始就在前线作战的士兵说，他从来不曾听到过中国人有什么暴行，不管汉莱怎么说，他决不能相信。”
