Xinhua News Agency, Northern Korea, 31st – A US aggressor army bomber once again bombed a POW camp in a certain area of northern Korea at 10 PM on October 13th, dropping approximately 60 fragmentation bombs, killing 7 and wounding 14. This incident aroused great indignation among US and British prisoners. 1,362 American and British prisoners of war jointly issued an accusation to the people of the world, protesting the atrocities of American aircraft.

Of the 21 people killed and wounded by US aircraft this time, one American POW officer died, seven American and British POW officers and soldiers were injured, as well as one cook from the POW camp staff died, two were injured, four Korean residents died, four were injured, and two overseas Chinese were injured. In addition, nine houses were destroyed, and part of the POW camp's grain and utensils were burned.

The POW camp is located in northern Korea, far from the battlefield, and there are no military targets whatsoever. According to a post-incident investigation, the bombs dropped by the American bomber this time, apart from one high-explosive bomb, were all fragmentation bombs specifically designed to kill people, numbering as many as 60. When the American plane bombed, the staff and doctors of the POW camp braved danger to quickly go to the scene to put out the flames and rescue the injured.

Since February, American aircraft have repeatedly bombed and strafed POW camps. Once on February 19th at 2:30 PM, 19 American prisoners were killed and wounded; once on March 17th, two American prisoners were killed; once on April 2nd, one American prisoner was killed; and again on April 22nd at 1 PM, 32 American prisoners were killed and wounded.

The 1,362 American, British, and other prisoners of war in the POW camp, in a burst of indignation, drafted a letter of protest jointly through the American and British POW Peace Committee they themselves elected, demanding that the atrocities of American aircraft be stopped.

In addition, the Standing Committee of the American and British POW Peace Committee, on behalf of the prisoners of war in the POW camp, sent a letter of condolence to the family of Robert G. (Gé màn) , the American POW Lieutenant who was killed in the bombing. The letter said: German became ill after being captured.

"But thanks to the hospital's careful and excellent treatment, his illness was completely cured, and he lived a normal and healthy life with us. He looked forward to the day when he could go back and reunite with his loved ones. He, like everyone else, hoped that this unjust war would end soon. But now he is dead, killed by the insane bombing of the POW camp by American aircraft."

The letter of condolence told German's family: "Our deepest words of mourning cannot bring your loved one back to life, but we believe that the deceased hopes that you will continue his unfinished ambition - to fight to end the Korean War." (Attached pictures)

    美机又一次轰炸朝鲜北部某地俘虏营
    炸死炸伤当地居民和美英俘虏二十一人
    该地千三百余美英俘虏联名向全世界人民提出控诉
    【本报讯】据新华社朝鲜北部三十一日电：美国侵略军轰炸机一架于十月十三日晚十时又一次轰炸朝鲜北部某地的某俘虏营，投掷杀伤弹约六十枚，炸死七人，炸伤十四人。这一事件引起美英俘虏们极大的激愤。一千三百六十二名美军的和英军的俘虏联名向全世界人民提出控诉，抗议美国飞机的暴行。
    这次被美机炸死炸伤的二十一人中，有美军俘虏军官一名死亡、美、英军俘虏官兵七名受伤，以及俘虏营工作人员炊事员一名死亡、二名受伤，朝鲜居民四名死亡、四名受伤，华侨二名受伤。此外，炸毁房屋九间，烧毁俘虏营的粮食和用具一部。
    俘虏营位于朝鲜北部离战场很远，而且没有任何军事目标。据事后调查，美国轰炸机这次所投炸弹，除一枚是高度爆炸性炸弹外，其他全是专为杀人的杀伤弹，数目竟达六十枚之多。当美机轰炸时，俘虏营的工作人员和医生冒着危险迅速到出事地点扑灭火焰，和救护受伤的人。
    自二月间至今，美国飞机已迭次轰炸、扫射俘虏营，一次在二月十九日下午二时三十分，美国俘虏被打死打伤十九名；一次在三月十七日，美俘被打死二人；一次在四月二日，美俘被打死一人；又一次在四月二十二日下午一时，美俘被打死打伤三十二人。
    该俘虏营的一千三百六十二名美、英等国俘虏，在群情激愤之下，经过他们自己选出的美英战俘和平委员会，联名起草了一个抗议书，要求制止美国飞机的暴行。
    此外，美英战俘和平委员会常务委员会代表俘虏营的俘虏并致函慰问被炸死的美国俘虏罗贝特·格曼空军少尉的家属。该函说：格曼被俘后病了。
    “但由于医院的细心和高明的治疗，他的病完全好了，他和我们一起正常地、健康地生活着。他盼望着有一天他能够回去和他的亲爱的人们团圆。他和他们大家一样希望这个非正义的战争赶快结束。但他现在死了，他死在美国飞机对俘虏营施行的狂炸之下。”
    慰问信对格曼的家属说：“我们深深哀悼的话语不能使你们亲爱的人复活，但我们相信，死者希望你们继续他的未竟之志——为结束朝鲜战争而斗争。”（附图片）
