    Resolution of the Fourth Meeting of the East China Military and Political Committee
    Launching the Movement for Increased Production and Economy and Ideological Remolding
[Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 25th] The Fourth Plenary Committee Meeting of the East China Military and Political Committee was held from the 19th to the 24th. Based on the resolutions and spirit of the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the meeting reviewed the work of the East China Military and Political Committee since its Third Plenary Committee Meeting and discussed and defined the future work tasks. Chairman Rao Shushi put forward seven work tasks for the future in his opening speech: 1. Strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea; 2. Continue to suppress counter-revolutionaries; 3. Thoroughly complete land reform and vigorously develop agricultural production; 4. Strengthen democratic political construction and convene people's representative conferences at all levels on schedule, and make it a regular system; 5. Develop industrial production, develop urban and rural material exchanges, continue to stabilize finance and prices, and strive for further improvement in financial and economic situation; 6. Launch a large-scale movement for increased production and economy, and strive to complete and exceed the plan to increase production and save wealth worth 3.5 trillion yuan for the country within one year; 7. Launch an ideological remolding movement. All the committee members present unanimously agreed with Chairman Rao Shushi's opening speech. The meeting also called on all levels of people's governments and people from all walks of life in the East China region to resolutely implement the seven work tasks put forward by Chairman Rao Shushi in his opening speech, especially to strive for continuing to deepen and carry out the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, launch a large-scale patriotic movement for increased production and economy, and widely carry out the ideological remolding movement.

    The meeting discussed the three central tasks of continuing to strengthen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, advocating and promoting the patriotic movement for increased production and economy, and widely carrying out the ideological remolding movement. During the discussion, the committee members and attendees were full of confidence in completing and exceeding the plan proposed by Chairman Rao Shushi to increase production and save wealth worth 3.5 trillion yuan for the country. The meeting passed the "Resolution on Launching the Patriotic Movement for Increased Production and Economy." The resolution specifically stipulates: 1. All agencies, units, and industrial and mining enterprises should, without exception, launch the patriotic movement for increased production and economy, without harming work and the health of workers. 2. Governments at all levels and other aspects must launch a streamlining and economy movement. The policy of streamlining and economy should be implemented from adjusting institutions, tightening staffing, reducing levels, streamlining personnel, clearing materials, prohibiting waste, severely punishing corruption, improving work efficiency, and opposing bureaucracy. Expenses that can be saved must be saved; expenses that should be spent should also be saved as much as possible. 3. All state-owned factories, mines, transportation, post and telecommunications, and public and public-private joint ventures must launch a movement for increased production and economy. The policy of increasing production and economy should be implemented from maximizing the potential of existing equipment, accelerating capital turnover, improving operating methods, increasing output, improving quality, reducing waste, eliminating waste, saving raw materials, reducing costs, and implementing economic accounting systems. All industrial and mining enterprises should formulate practical and feasible plans for increased production and economy based on specific conditions and possibilities.

    The meeting discussed Chairman Mao's instructions on the ideological remolding movement and the relevant resolutions of the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), and passed the "Resolution on Widely Carrying Out the Ideological Remolding Movement in the East China Region." In the group discussions and speeches at the meeting, people from cultural and educational circles and business circles believed that the East China region has a long history of being invaded by imperialist culture, which has a profound impact, so ideological remolding is particularly important and the requirements are more urgent. They hope to strengthen leadership and systematically launch the study movement of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought combined with the practice of the Chinese revolution.

    The meeting also passed the "Resolution on Rural Work Tasks After the Completion of Land Reform," and decided to take improving the political consciousness of peasants, following Chairman Mao's instructions on "On Cooperatives" and "Get Organized," leading peasants to universally organize mutual aid teams based on the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, focusing on establishing agricultural production cooperatives, and vigorously developing agricultural production as the central tasks.

    Finally, Chairman Rao Shushi made a summary at the meeting.
