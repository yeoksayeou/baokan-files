    How Did Dalian Institute of Technology Carry Out Reform?
    Qu Bochuan, President of Dalian Institute of Technology

    (1) Reforming the Academic System
    Dalian University was founded in 1949, comprising the Institute of Technology, the Institute of Medicine, and the Russian Language School. Last year, the National Higher Education Conference clearly proposed the direction of establishing independent higher industrial schools. Following this, the Northeast People's Government's Ministry of Education officially ordered the dissolution of Dalian University and the separate establishment of Dalian Institute of Technology, Dalian Institute of Medicine, and Dalian Russian Language School.

    Before the Northeast People's Government's Ministry of Education formally ordered the separation, Dalian University had also deliberated and discussed the issue of separating the schools. At that time, some incorrect views existed among a minority of teachers. For example, some people believed that Dalian University should be expanded into a comprehensive university, that colleges of arts and law should be added, and that its scale should be gradually expanded so that in the future there would be alumni of Dalian University everywhere. Some non-Party comrades even wondered why the Communist Party dismantled a university that had only been established for a year. Others believed that it was easier to recruit students for a "university," and that in a multi-disciplinary university, if one department was not doing well, it would not be noticeable and would not affect the overall situation. As Vice Minister Qian Junrui pointed out, the root of these erroneous ideas was feudalism, sectarianism, and departmentalism.

    After everyone agreed to the separation, new ideological problems arose: many people advocated changing the school's name to "Dalian University of Technology" and opposed calling it "Dalian Institute of Technology," feeling that "university" was superior and sounded better than "institute." Some people believed that the larger Dalian Institute of Technology was, the better. On the one hand, they acknowledged that the school should be specialized, but on the other hand, they were reluctant to adjust the weaker departments out. After explanations from higher authorities, these ideological problems were finally resolved.

    Dalian Institute of Technology was officially established on July 23rd last year. The separation work was carried out under the leadership of the president and the secretary-general. At that time, we emphasized that no unit should compete for school property.

    Based on our practical experience after the separation, we have realized that an independent institute of technology has advantages.

    First, it reduces administrative layers. Dalian University was administratively divided into three levels: school, institute, and department. It was unclear whether the institute director was under the leadership of the provost, and how the director and the provost divided the leadership of the departments. Sometimes, the decisions made by the provost's office were not communicated to the institutes and departments. At the same time, the leadership structure of the entire school was too large. During school affairs meetings, the institutes did not care about each other. For example, the Institute of Technology did not care about discussions concerning the Institute of Medicine; similarly, the Institute of Medicine did not care about discussions concerning the Institute of Technology; but when it came to funding, everyone competed. Dalian Institute of Technology only has two levels, institute and department, and the number of departments is also relatively small, making it much easier to lead.

    Second, it strengthens leadership – especially the leadership of teaching. The provost of Dalian University studied engineering, so he was relatively familiar with the courses of the various departments of the Institute of Technology. Therefore, he could lead the teaching of the Institute of Technology, but the Institute of Medicine and the Russian Language School said that he did not provide enough care. After the separation, the president and the provost could deeply lead the various departments, review teaching plans, and inspect teaching conditions, thus truly implementing the president's responsibility system.

    From our experience of more than a year after the separation, we have a deeper understanding of the many advantages of a single-discipline institute of technology. Therefore, we feel that further specialization of Dalian Institute of Technology is entirely necessary. We currently have eight departments, and the Department of Metallurgy has been decided to merge into the Northeast Institute of Technology. We are now also preparing to separate out several other departments. Fewer departments make it easier to lead, and we can also enroll more students, save teachers, and save equipment. For example, enrolling 5,000 students in ten departments requires more teachers than enrolling them in five departments.

    Now, the Northeast Ministry of Education and the Northeast Ministry of Industry are discussing merging the same departments in several higher industrial schools in the Northeast to separately establish colleges of civil engineering, water conservancy, and iron and steel. From a national perspective, the industrial scale of the Northeast is the largest, but there is a shortage of technical personnel. It is necessary to further adjust the departments and concentrate human and material resources to cultivate a large number of industrial construction talents.

    (2) Textbook Problems
    Based on the resolution of last year's Higher Education Conference, we strive to use Chinese textbooks as much as possible. Currently, Dalian Institute of Technology has a total of 53 kinds of existing Chinese textbooks, 39 kinds of Chinese lecture notes compiled by ourselves, 12 kinds of translated Soviet textbooks (of which three have been published), and 3 kinds of textbooks compiled with reference to Soviet textbooks.

    Using Chinese textbooks is of great convenience to students, saving their energy and improving teaching efficiency. At the same time, compiling and translating textbooks can also improve the professional level of teachers. In the past, some teachers used foreign language textbooks, and if they made mistakes, no one would know, and they could often use foreign languages to cover up their shortcomings. But with Chinese textbooks, teachers cannot be careless in their lectures and must be extra careful in their teaching.

    Because we encourage teachers to compile and translate textbooks, we have made some achievements as mentioned above, but our textbooks are only Chinese textbooks and not Chinese textbooks. Most of the illustrations in our textbooks are foreign materials, which needs to be improved.

    (3) Political and Ideological Education of Teachers and Students
        Problems
    In the past two years, our teachers have studied "History of Social Development," "Political Economy," "Imperialism," and "Foundations of Leninism," and have also undergone ideological education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. The ideological level of the teachers has been greatly improved. This is of great help in improving the quality of teaching and improving the ideological level of students.

    Through these studies, teachers have realized that the Communist Party cares about non-Party comrades in the same way, that the Party treats everyone as its own cadres, and that it constantly pays attention to cultivating and improving them. They realize that they have a political future.

    Regarding student counseling and political work, in addition to conducting political classes, a guidance office has been established, with one instructor assigned to each class. The instructor is concurrently held by a teaching assistant, and the instructor is under the dual leadership of the guidance office and the department head, responsible for guiding students' lives and studies. Experience over the past year has proven that this instructor system is good.

    Students hold a life review meeting once a month, and it is stipulated that each student must write an ideological appraisal after completing the first year of courses, and second-year students must write an autobiography. This enables the school to have a relatively deep understanding of the ideology and historical situation of students above the third grade. Teachers have also been educated in the process of participating in students' ideological appraisals.

    (4) Learning from the Soviet Union
    In terms of teaching, we established 27 teaching and research sections after last year's Higher Education Conference, which has increased to 36 this year. We sent people to Harbin Institute of Technology to learn how to organize teaching and research sections. Based on our experience over the past year, textbooks must be discussed by the teaching and research group in order to improve the quality of teaching. Last semester, our slogan was "Do a good job in the teaching and research group and improve the quality of teaching." This semester, our slogan is "Do a good job in classroom tutoring and improve the quality of teaching." Through classroom tutoring, our teaching efficiency has improved, and students' ability to digest information has also improved.

    We have learned from teaching that Soviet textbooks are the best in the world. According to the experience of many teachers, teachers who refer to Soviet books definitely teach well; many teachers have also gained new insights and improved their teaching work after talking to Soviet experts once. Some of our teachers are learning Russian while translating textbooks. In this way, Russian is learned well, textbooks are translated, and their own teaching ability is improved as a result.

    The atmosphere of teachers learning Russian is very good. For example, the Mathematics Department proposed that by 1952, all teachers in the department should be able to understand Russian books.

    We are learning from the Soviet experience and making full use of classrooms and laboratories: it is stipulated that each laboratory should be used eight times a week.

    Finally, let me briefly talk about the equipment in our school. Our principle is: if we can make it ourselves, we will make it ourselves; if we can buy it outside the customs, we will not buy it inside the customs; if we can buy it domestically, we will not buy it abroad; if we can buy it in the Soviet Union and new democratic countries, we will never buy it in capitalist countries. At the same time, we have manufactured a lot of equipment ourselves, saving a lot of money for the country, and also manufactured equipment for Dalian Medical College and other schools; and the drawings of the equipment were designed after discussion by the teaching and research group. This has also improved the professional level of teachers.

    大连工学院是怎样进行改革的？
    大连工学院院长  屈伯川
    （一）改革学制问题
    大连大学是一九四九年创办的，它包括工学院、医学院及俄语专科三部分。去年全国高等教育会议明确提出了单独设立高等工业学校的方向以后，东北人民政府教育部即明令将大连大学取消，分别成立大连工学院、大连医学院及大连俄文专科学校。
    在东北人民政府教育部正式明令分校以前，大连大学也曾酝酿、讨论过分校的问题。当时在少数教师中存在着一些不正确的看法。例如有些人认为大连大学应当扩充成为一个包罗万象的大学，应当增设文法学院，使其规模日渐扩大，将来能够在各处都有大连大学的校友。有些非党同志甚至怀疑为什么共产党把刚办了一年的大学就又拆散了呢？还有人认为“大学”招生比较容易，在一个多科性的大学里某一院系办得差一点看不出来，无碍大体。这些看法正如钱俊瑞副部长所指出的，这种错误思想的根源便是封建思想、宗派思想和本位主义思想。
    在大家同意分校以后，新的思想问题又产生了：很多人主张把校名改成“大连工业大学”，反对叫
    “大连工学院”，他们觉得“大学”比“学院”要高一等，要好听些。有些人认为大连工学院愈大愈好，他们一方面承认学校应当专业化，但另一方面又舍不得把较弱的系调整出去。经过上级的解释，这些思想问题总算解决了。
    去年七月二十三日分校，大连工学院正式成立。分校的工作是在校长和秘书长的领导下进行的，我们当时着重提出任何一个单位都不得争校产。
    根据我们分校以后的实际经验，我们体会到一个独立的工学院是有好处的。
    首先，减少了行政的层次。大连大学在行政上分为校、院、系三级，院长受不受教务长的领导、院长和教务长对系的领导如何分工等问题都不明确，有时候教务处作出的决定，院系全不接头。同时整个学校的领导机构过于庞大，开校务会议时各院互不关心，例如讨论医学院的事，工学院不关心；讨论工学院的事医学院同样不关心；谈到经费则又大家争。大连工学院则只有院系两级，系的数目也比较少，领导起来方便得多。
    其次，加强了领导——特别是对于教学的领导。大连大学的教务长是学工的，他对工学院各系的课程比较熟悉，因此他能领导工学院的教学，但医学院及俄文专科却说他照顾不够。分校以后，院长和教务长能深入地领导各系，审查教学计划，检查教学情况，因而也就可以真正实行院长负责制。
    从我们分校后一年多的经验，我们更深刻地认识到单科性的工学院是有很多优点的，因而我们也就觉得大连工学院进一步的专业化也是完全必要的。我们现在有八个系，冶金系已决定并入东北工学院，现在还准备把几个系分出去。系别少领导起来方便，也可以多招学生，节省教员，节省设备。举个例说：招生五千人办十系比办五系所需的教员是要多些。
    现在东北教育部正与东北工业部讨论把东北几个高等工业学校的相同系科，合并起来分别成立土木学院、水利学院、钢铁学院等。从全国来看，东北的工业规模最大，但技术人员缺少，必须进一步调整院系，集中人力物力以培养大量的工业建设人材。
    （二）教材问题
    我们根据去年高等教育会议的决议，尽量采用中文教材。现在大连工学院各系总计用现成的中文教材共五十三种，自己编的中文讲义三十九种，翻译了十二种苏联教材（其中已有三种出版），参照苏联教本所编的教材有三种。
    用中文教材对学生说来是有很大的方便的，可以节省学生的精力，也可以提高教学效率。同时，通过编译教材也能使教师的业务水平提高。过去有些教员用外国文教材，讲错了大家不知道，他往往可以借洋文掩饰自己的缺欠，但用了中文教材，教师讲课就不能马虎了，他必须格外认真地进行教学。
    由于我们鼓励教师编译教材，有了上面所说的一些成绩，但我们的教材只是中文教材而不是中国教材，我们的教材中的图例大多是外国材料，这是需要改进的。
    （三）对师生的政治思想教育
        问题
    两年来我们的教师学习了“社会发展史”“政治经济学”“帝国主义论”及“论列宁主义基础”这四本书，又经过了抗美援朝的思想教育，教师的思想水平都大大提高。这对于提高教学质量及提高同学的思想水平都是有很大的帮助的。
    通过这几次学习，教师们体会到共产党对于非党同志同样是关心的，党把大家当做自己的干部，并经常注意培养和提高他们。他们认识到自己在政治上是有出路的。
    关于同学的辅导工作与政治工作，除进行政治课以外，并成立指导室，每班设一指导员，由助教兼任，指导员受指导室及系主任的双重领导，负责指导同学的生活与学习。一年来的经验证明，这种指导员制度是好的。
    同学们每月举行一次生活检讨会，并规定每个同学在修毕一年级的课程后要做思想鉴定，二年级生要写自传，这样就使学校对三年级以上的同学的思想与历史情况有了比较深刻的了解。教师们也在参加同学的思想鉴定工作中，受到了教育。
    （四）向苏联学习的问题
    在教学方面，我们在去年高等教育会议以后就成立了二十七个教学研究室，今年增加到三十六个。我们曾派人到哈尔滨工业大学去学习如何组织教学研究室。根据我们一年来的经验，教材必须经过教学研究组的讨论，这样才能提高教学质量。上学期我们的口号是“搞好教学研究组，提高教学质量”。这学期我们的口号是“搞好课堂辅导，提高教学质量”。通过课堂辅导，我们的教学效率提高了，同学的消化能力也提高了。
    我们从教学中体会到苏联的教材是世界上最好的。根据许多教师的经验，凡是参考了苏联书的教师，教课一定教得好；有很多教师和苏联专家谈过一次话以后，也能得到新的启示，改进了自己的教学工作。我们有些教师是一边学俄文一边翻译教材，这样一来，俄文学好了，教材翻译出来了，自己的教学能力也因而提高。
    教师学俄文的风气很好，像数学系就提出到一九五二年要全系的教师都能看懂俄文书。
    我们正在学习苏联的经验，充分利用教室与实验室：规定每个实验室每周用八次。
    最后附带谈一下关于我们学校的仪器设备。我们的原则是：能自制的就自制；能在关外买的不到关内买；能在国内买的不到国外买；能在苏联和新民主主义国家买的绝不到资本主义国家去买。同时，我们自己制造了很多仪器，给国家节省了很多钱，并且还给大连医学院等学校制造仪器；而仪器的图样则是经过教学研究组讨论后设计的。这样也就提高了教师的业务水平。
