    The Sixth Hospital Administration Bureau of the Logistics and Health Department of the Northeast Military Region Should Cherish Gifts for Wounded Soldiers

    Comrade Editor: The Sixth Hospital Administration Bureau of the Logistics and Health Department of the Northeast Military Region has received a large number of comic books, literary works, magazines, and books donated by people from all over the country to the wounded soldiers. However, after these books were transported to the bureau, they were randomly placed in rooms and corridors and were not promptly distributed to the wounded soldiers. Some people casually went there to take books to read, and after reading them, they were thrown aside, and no one cared about them. Some better books, such as good literary works and poetry collections, were taken as their own. I saw that on the covers of many books, there were words of warm greetings and respect from the senders to the wounded soldiers. However, these books were not delivered to the wounded soldiers. I think this is wrong.

    In addition, some gramophones and radios donated to the wounded soldiers from various places have been kept in the bureau for seven or eight months, and some have not yet been distributed to the convalescents but are being used by the staff within the bureau.

    I believe that this phenomenon must be corrected immediately. The people of the whole country love the people's army and enthusiastically sent gifts of condolences. These gifts are sacred gifts, and the comrades who manage these things should pay more attention to these things and quickly distribute them to the people who deserve them so that they do not suffer any loss. The wounded and sick soldiers need spiritual food, and the comrades of the Hospital Administration Bureau should help them and find ways to meet their requirements. I suggest that the organizations and staff in charge of condolence materials must establish the idea of attaching importance to condolence materials and be responsible to the wounded and sick soldiers and responsible to the people.

    东北军区后勤卫生部第六医院管理局应爱惜对伤员的慰问品
    编辑同志：东北军区后勤卫生部第六医院管理局，曾收到各地人民赠送给伤员的大批小人书、文艺作品、杂志、书籍等。但这些书籍运到该局后，就乱放在室内、走廊里，没有及时发给伤员。有些人随便到那里去取书看，看完之后便扔在一旁无人过问。有些比较好的书籍，如好的文学作品、诗集等，就被人据为己有。我看到有很多书籍的封面上，写着送书人对伤员们热情慰问和崇敬的话。可是这些书却没有送到伤员手里。我认为这是不对的。
    还有一些各地赠送伤员的留声机、无线电收音机，有的在该局压了七、八个月，竟有一部分还没有发给休养员，而被局内工作人员使用着。
    我认为，这种现象必须立刻纠正。全国人民热爱人民的军队，热情地送了慰问品。这些慰问品是神圣的礼物，管理这些东西的同志，应该加倍重视这些东西，并迅速分发给应得这些东西的人，不能使其有任何损失。伤病员需要精神食粮，医院管理局的同志，应该帮助他们，想办法满足他们的要求才对。我建议管理慰问物资的机关和工作人员，必须树立起重视慰问物资的思想，对伤病员负责、对人民负责。
