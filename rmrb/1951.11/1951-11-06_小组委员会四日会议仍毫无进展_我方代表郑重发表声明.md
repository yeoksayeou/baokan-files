Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 5th: The subcommittee meeting on November 4th remained deadlocked due to the U.S. side's continued insistence on its unreasonable demand to occupy our Kaesong area. Our representative in the subcommittee repeatedly pointed out that, according to our proposal, the other side's withdrawal from the Kimhwa and Kosong salient areas has already been adequately compensated by our withdrawal from the area between these two salients, namely from the Kumi-dong to Kwangsil-dong line. Since the areas withdrawn by the other side are militarily untenable salient positions, while the areas withdrawn by our side are long-held and consolidated positions, the favorable positions withdrawn by our side should naturally not be, and should not be required to be, completely equal in area to the salient positions withdrawn by the other side. Moreover, even so, we are still willing to make necessary supplementary revisions to our proposal when correcting the line of contact between the two sides based on actual materials. Disregarding the fact that our proposal already provides adequate compensation for the other side's withdrawal from the Kosong and Kimhwa salients along the Kumi-dong to Kwangsil-dong line, the other side insisted at the subcommittee meeting on November 3rd that we were asking them to withdraw more than 200 square kilometers. In fact, these 200 square kilometers of land simply do not exist. Where did these so-called 200 square kilometers of land come from? The other side, based on an erroneous line of contact, overstated their withdrawal from the salients in the Kosong and Kimhwa area by about 100 square kilometers, while underestimating our withdrawal from the Kumi-dong to Kwangsil-dong line by about 100 square kilometers. On November 4th, our representative sternly pointed out, based on these facts, that the other side's attempt to exchange our Kaesong area with these 200-plus square kilometers, which simply do not exist in reality, is absurd, absolutely unacceptable, and completely unacceptable. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers are firmly opposed to the U.S. side's absurd demand to occupy Kaesong, and are equally firmly opposed to the U.S. side's equally absurd demand to place Kaesong under U.S. control, but with so-called demilitarization. Our representative solemnly declared: If the U.S. side still believes that the adjustment suggested in our proposal is in any way detrimental to the U.S. side, and insists on exchanging our Kaesong area with an area that simply does not exist in reality, we are fully prepared to consider a withdrawal of two kilometers from the existing line of contact on both sides, without making any adjustments at all. The U.S. side may agree with our principle of ceasefire in place and adjustment in place, or it may oppose any adjustment and only agree with the principle of ceasefire in place. But whether it is the former or the latter, the U.S. side cannot occupy Kaesong. If the U.S. side is obstinate and insists on demanding the occupation of Kaesong, opposing both ceasefire in place and adjustment in place, and opposing ceasefire in place without any adjustment, then the responsibility for delaying the armistice negotiations lies entirely with the U.S. side.

Xinhua News Agency, 5th: Pierre Béguin, a reporter for *Paris-Soir*, reported from Panmunjom on the 4th: On the morning of the 4th, the Korean-Chinese side said they were prepared to consider both sides withdrawing their troops two kilometers from the actual line of contact, leaving four kilometers as a demilitarized zone, if the U.S. side continued to bargain over the issue of Kaesong in the Panmunjom conference tent. In this way, the U.S. side could no longer fabricate any excuse to demand Kaesong, because the line of contact is far south of the city. However, the U.S. representative said he hoped for adjustments, and the U.S. representative spent a lot of time making a big deal of calculating how many square kilometers of land the U.S. side had given up more than the Korean-Chinese side when the demarcation line was straightened. As soon as the representatives of the two sides opened the meeting at 3 p.m. on the 4th, the U.S. representative requested an adjournment until the morning of the 5th. At the morning meeting, the Korean-Chinese side explained that, from the actual situation of the front line, the 203 square kilometers of land claimed by the U.S. side was only land on paper, calculated based on a fabricated front line. The U.S. representative replied that it was these two hundred plus square kilometers of land that were being used to exchange for Kaesong. Even this fabricated argument by the U.S. side has been eliminated by the new proposal of the Korean-Chinese side. The Korean-Chinese side has resolutely rejected the U.S. side's cunning proposal to "demilitarize" Kaesong, considering it "clearly unacceptable." In fact, this U.S. proposal is purely a deceptive proposal aimed at placing Kaesong in the hands of the U.S. side and pushing the U.S. front line north of the city.

On the 3rd, when the United Nations reporters showed Nakos's drawing of the line of contact to the Korean-Chinese reporters, it was obvious that these reporters knew nothing about the situation in the tent. The United Nations reporters specifically asked the Korean-Chinese reporters to tell them the real line of contact drawn by the Korean-Chinese side and the proposed demarcation line, because they could not find out the actual situation from Nakos, the spokesman of the U.S. delegation; because the United Nations reporters were eager to know the actual situation, they were severely reprimanded by Nakos. Nakos formally told them at a press conference on the 3rd, "Don't believe" the news said by me and other reporters. He said we are "often wrong." But the United Nations reporters knew, and Nakos also knew, that he could not find any evidence to prove that the Korean-Chinese reporters had ever said untrue news—whether in their reports or in the news they released to the United Nations reporters almost every day.

### 小组委员会四日会议仍毫无进展  我方代表郑重发表声明

    小组委员会四日会议仍毫无进展
    我方代表郑重发表声明
    不论就地停战就地调整或就地停战不加任何调整，美方皆不能占有开城。如美方执迷不悟，坚持占有开城，则拖延停战谈判的责任完全在于美方。
    【新华社开城五日电】由于美方继续坚持占有我方开城地区的无理要求，十一月四日的小组委员会依然毫无进展。我方代表在小组委员会内曾不断指出，根据我方方案，对方在金城、高城两突出部分的撤退，已由我方在这两突出部分之间，即由姑味城里至广石洞一线上的撤退予以相应的适当的补偿。由于对方撤出部分是军事上不能据守的突出阵地，而我方撤出地区则是我军长期据守的巩固阵地，我方撤出的良好阵地，自然不能亦不应与对方撤出的突出阵地在面积上完全相等。而且即使如此，我方仍然愿意在根据实际材料校正双方接触线时，对我方方案作必要的补充修正。对方不顾我方在我方方案中对于对方在高城、金城二突出部分的撤退已在姑味城里至广石洞一线予以适当的补偿，在十一月三日的小组会上硬说我方要他们多撤出二百多平方公里。其实，这二百多平方公里的土地，是根本不存在的。这所谓二百多平方公里土地是从何而来的呢？对方根据错误的接触线，将他们在高城、金城一带突出部分的撤退，多说了约一百平方公里，而对于我方在姑味城里至广石洞一线的撤退则少算了约一百多平方公里。十一月四日，我方代表根据这些事实严词指出对方以这种事实上根本不存在的二百多平方公里来要求交换我方开城地区的企图，是荒谬的，绝对不能考虑，完全不能接受的。朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军既坚决反对美方占有开城的荒谬要求，也同样坚决反对美方将开城归于美方控制，但加以所谓非军事化的同样荒谬的要求。我方代表郑重声明：如果美方仍然认为我方方案所建议的调整对美方有任何不利，坚持以事实上根本不存在的地区来交换我方的开城地区，我方完全准备考虑双方各自现有接触线后撤二公里，根本不作任何调整。美方可同意我方就地停战就地调整的原则，亦可反对任何调整而只同意就地停战的原则。但不论是前者或是后者，美方皆不能占有开城。如果美方执迷不悟，坚持要求占有开城，既反对就地停战就地调整，亦反对就地停战而不加任何调整，则拖延停战谈判的责任，完全在于美方。
    【新华社五日讯】巴黎今晚报记者贝却敌四日自板门店报道：四日上午，朝中方面说，他们准备考虑双方都把自己的军队从实际接触线撤退两公里，留四公里做非军事区，如果美方仍然在板门店会议帐篷中就开城问题讨价还价的话。这样一来，美方再也捏造不出任何索取开城的藉口了，因为接触线是在该城以南很远的地方。但是美方代表说希望调整，美方代表曾花了很多时间来虚有其事地计算在把分界线拉直时美方比朝中方面多放弃多少平方公里土地。四日下午三点钟双方代表刚一开会，美方代表就要求休会至五日上午再开。在上午会议上，朝中方面代表说明从战线的实际情况看来，美方声称占有的二百零三平方公里土地只是根据捏造的战线而计算出来的只存在于纸上的土地而已。美方代表答应用来换取开城的正是这两百多平方公里土地。就连美方这种捏造的论据也被朝中方面的新建议勾消了。朝中方面已断然拒绝美方使开城“非军事化”的狡猾建议，认为它“显然不能接受”。其实这美方建议纯粹是一个骗人的建议，目的是使开城落入美方手里，并把美方战线推到该城以北。
    三日当联合国记者把纳科斯画的接触线拿给朝中记者看时，显然可以看出这些记者对于帐篷中的情况一无所知。联合国记者特别要求朝中记者把朝中方面画的真正接触线以及拟议中的分界线告诉他们，因为他们从美方代表团发言人纳科斯那里探听不到实际情况；由于联合国记者渴望知道实际情况，他们受到纳科斯严厉的斥责。纳科斯三日在新闻发布会上正式对他们说，“不要相信”我以及其他记者说的消息。他说我们“常常是错的”。但是联合国记者知道，而且纳科斯也知道，他绝不能找到丝毫证据足以证明朝中记者在任何时候说过不真实的消息——无论在报道中也好，或者在他们几乎每天对联合国记者发布的新闻中也好。
