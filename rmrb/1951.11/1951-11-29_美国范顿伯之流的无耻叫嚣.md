    The heavy blows of the Chinese and Korean people and the pressure of world opinion finally forced the U.S. side to accept the fair and reasonable proposals put forward by our delegation, thus reaching an agreement on the second item on the agenda of the Korean armistice negotiations. Undoubtedly, this important progress in the negotiations over the past four months is welcomed by peace-loving people all over the world.

    However, the progress made in the Korean armistice negotiations aroused fear and dissatisfaction among people like U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Vandenberg. According to an Agence France-Presse report from Washington on the 24th of this month, Vandenberg made a radio address last Thursday stating that if the Korean armistice negotiations failed, the United States would "bomb Manchuria." People would wonder: Why did Vandenberg repeat the old tune of "bombing Manchuria" when the Korean armistice negotiations were making progress? The answer to this is not difficult to find. In the same dispatch, Agence France-Presse reported on the reaction of the American market to the progress made in the Korean armistice negotiations, saying: "Security prices on the New York Stock Exchange have plummeted, with securities losing $1 billion in one day." In the bloody war in Korea, American military production enterprises and arms dealers have made huge profits. International Nickel Company, presided over by warmonger Dulles, has earned a net profit of $46 million in the first nine months of this year alone due to its contract with the U.S. Army Department to supply huge amounts of munitions for the war of aggression against Korea. Undoubtedly, the progress made in the Korean armistice negotiations has undermined the possibility of their continuing to reap profits from the war of aggression against Korea. Representing the interests of these arms dealers, and in order to maintain their bloody profits, Vandenberg and his ilk are attempting to use this despicable trick to create a tense atmosphere once again, in order to recover the misfortunes their securities have encountered in the trading market.

    However, the attempts of Vandenberg and his ilk are in vain. It is not only Vandenberg who is clamoring for "expanding the Korean War" and "bombing Manchuria." MacArthur had already made the same clamors before, but the facts are contrary to the wishes of these clamorers. The U.S. bloc was finally forced to accept the proposal to hold Korean armistice negotiations; the progress made in the negotiations today fully proves the failure of these clamors. The victory of the Chinese and Korean People's Forces on the Korean battlefield and the vigorous development of the world people's movement for peace have meant that the U.S. aggressors will continue to suffer increasingly heavy blows and difficulties not only in Korea but also in all regions of the world. Under these circumstances, the howling of the likes of Vandenberg will obviously not change the policy that the U.S. bloc has to adopt in the current Korean negotiations. Therefore, such howling is not enough to hinder the continuation of the current Korean armistice negotiations.

### 美国范顿伯之流的无耻叫嚣

    美国范顿伯之流的无耻叫嚣
    在中朝人民的沉重打击和世界舆论的压力之下，美方终于不得不接受我方代表团所提出的公平合理的建议，使朝鲜停战谈判的第二项议程达成协议。无疑的，这个在谈判进行四个月以来的重要进展，是为全世界爱好和平的人民所欢迎的。
    然而，朝鲜停战谈判获得的进展却引起了美国空军参谋长范顿伯之流的恐惧和不满。据法新社华盛顿本月二十四日消息，范顿伯于上星期四发表广播谈话表示：如果朝鲜停战谈判失败，美国就要“轰炸满洲”。人们会怀疑：为什么在朝鲜停战谈判获得进展时，范顿伯却重弹“轰炸满洲”的老调呢？这是不难找到答案的。在同一条消息中法新社报道了美国市场对朝鲜停战谈判获得进展的反应说：“纽约证券交易所的证券价格已突然下跌，一天中证券损失了十亿美元。”在朝鲜血腥的战争中，美国的军事生产企业和军火商人已获得了巨额的利润，仅仅战争贩子杜勒斯主持的国际镍公司，由于与美国陆军部订立了供应侵朝战争巨量军火的合同，在今年的前九个月就获得了纯利四千六百万美元。无疑地，朝鲜停战谈判的获得进展，已使他们从侵朝战争中继续捞取利润的可能性受到了打击。代表着这些军火商人的利益，并且为了维持这些军火商人血腥的利润，范顿伯之流就企图用这种卑劣的伎俩再一次制造紧张的空气，以图挽回他们的证券在交易场中所遭遇的厄运。
    然而，范顿伯之流的企图是徒然的。叫嚣“扩大朝鲜战争”和“轰炸满洲”的不仅是今天的范顿伯，在此以前，麦克阿瑟早已作了同样的叫嚣，然而事实却与这些叫嚣者的愿望相反，美国集团终于被迫接受了举行朝鲜停战谈判的建议；今天谈判获得了进展，就充分证明了这些叫嚣的失败。中朝人民部队在朝鲜战场上的胜利和全世界人民争取和平运动的蓬勃发展，已使美国侵略者不仅在朝鲜而且在全世界各地区的侵略都将继续遭受到日益沉重的打击和困难。在这种情况下，范顿伯之流的叫嚣，显然并不能改变美国集团在目前朝鲜谈判中所不得不采取的政策，因此，这种叫嚣也就不足以妨碍目前朝鲜停战谈判的继续进行。
