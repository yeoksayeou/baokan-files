The Correctness of Professor Jin Kemu’s Study Attitude

To the Editor:

After reading Professor Jin Kemu’s article from Peking University, “Political Study Must Solve Practical Problems,” I feel that the following three points are particularly worth mentioning:

I. His study attitude is correct. Professor Jin Kemu's study attitude starts from reality. He recognizes the important significance of studying to transform thinking, improve work, and solve practical problems. Therefore, he has the courage to point out the shortcomings and problems existing in the work of Peking University in order to improve them. This is fundamentally different from the dogmatic study attitude that does not relate to reality or touch on ideas.

II. He considers issues from the perspective of national interests. Professor Jin Kemu’s responsible spirit in raising the shortcomings in Peking University's work and the shortcomings of some comrades will undoubtedly promote the work of Peking University. This study attitude is fundamentally different from the liberal attitude that focuses solely on personal considerations and is concerned with personal gains and losses.

III. It is enlightening for other schools. In addition to the study attitude and the attitude of facing problems head-on, which can greatly help other teachers, Professor Jin Kemu's article is also enlightening for the administrative and educational work of other schools. Because other schools inevitably, to varying degrees, have similar shortcomings to Peking University. After reading this article, as long as teachers in each school are willing to humbly examine themselves and reflect, they will discover some shortcomings in themselves and their work, improve them, and be elevated.

Professor Jin Kemu’s Questions Deserve Attention

To the Editor:

After reading Professor Jin Kemu's article from Peking University, "Political Study Must Solve Practical Problems," we believe that it is very good that Professor Jin Kemu was able to raise specific questions in a timely manner. At the same time, we also believe that the "clear ideological leadership" issue and the "lack of emphasis on political and ideological education" issue raised by Professor Jin Kemu are worth noting; because the above problems have not been well resolved, "departmentalism with each doing things in their own way" and "vulgar liberalistic habits" have arisen. We feel that this is not just a problem for Peking University alone, but a common problem.

Today, the purpose of the study movement for university teachers is to fundamentally solve these problems. We warmly welcome this study movement. We wish our teachers a great victory on the ideological front!

Students of Peking Union Medical College Place Great Hopes on Teachers' Ideological Remolding Study

To the Editor:

The professors in our school are actively participating in the ideological remolding study movement. As Chairman Mao said, this "is a new atmosphere in our country that is worth celebrating." We are not only very happy, but also place great hopes on this study for the teachers.

Our school used to be one of the strongholds for American imperialism to carry out cultural aggression. Its curriculum was not in line with the needs of the broad masses of the Chinese people. During the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, our school was taken over by the Central People's Government; after the takeover, under the leadership of the People's Government, progress has been made in all aspects. However, this progress is not enough. In particular, the teaching system is still basically American and has not been fundamentally reformed. After the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, our classmates have made a lot of progress. At the beginning of this semester, we also studied the resolutions of the 15th National Student Congress, and everyone is determined to be a cadre with both ability and integrity, strong physique, and a high level of communist consciousness. Moreover, we have also established patriotic pacts to strive to achieve this goal. However, under the old school system that has not yet been reformed, the workload is heavy. Until now, we have not been able to implement the State Council's decision on improving the health of students at all levels of schools. We do not get enough sleep, and we do not have enough time for exercise, and political study is naturally difficult to carry out. Everyone is troubled by this situation.

On October 23, Zhou Enlai’s report was conveyed in our school, and professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants all actively participated. We all felt excited. We all earnestly hope that teachers can make great progress in this study, so as to transform the old and unreasonable set of American teaching system and run Peking Union Medical College better.

Students of Nankai University Warmly Welcome Teachers' Ideological Remolding

To the Editor:

The ongoing study movement for university teachers has attracted the close attention of our students at Nankai University. We warmly welcome the展开 [zhǎn kāi - unfolding, launch] of this movement.

In the two years since liberation, teachers have made great progress, but some teachers still retain, to varying degrees, the ideological consciousness of the European and American bourgeoisie, teaching with a super-class viewpoint, or mechanically taking out a set of things learned from abroad and lecturing without criticism. The unfolding of this movement will surely greatly transform these erroneous ideas.

The teachers of Nankai University also warmly welcome this movement. Professor Chen Rongzhi of the Electrical Engineering Department said: "Premier Zhou's report made me clearly realize who to serve." Associate Professor Yang Zhongqi of the Physics Department said: "After listening to the communication of Premier Zhou's report, I realized that in order to contribute the greatest strength to the construction of the motherland, it is not only necessary to do a good job in business, but more importantly, ideological remolding. I must study hard in the future and thoroughly transform myself."

### 开展高等学校教师政治学习运动！

    开展高等学校教师政治学习运动！
    金克木教授的学习态度是
    正确的编辑同志：我读了北京大学金克木教授所写的“政治学习必须解决实际问题”一文后，感觉有以下三点是特别值得提出的：
    一、他的学习态度正确。金克木教授的学习态度是从实际出发的。他认识了学习是为了改造思想，改进工作，解决实际问题的重要意义，因此他有勇气将北京大学工作中所存在的缺点和问题指出来，以求改进。这和那些不联系实际，不接触思想的教条主义学习态度，有本质上的区别。
    二、他从国家利益着眼来对待问题。金克木教授对北京大学工作中的缺点和某些同志的缺点，能以负责任的精神提出，无疑地对北京大学工作是会起推动作用的。这种学习态度与专从个人着想，患得患失的自由主义态度有原则的不同。
    三、对其他学校有启发。金克木教授的文章，除学习态度，与正面对待问题的态度能给其他教师很大帮助外，对于其他学校的行政及教育工作，也有启发作用。因为其他学校也不可避免地、或轻或重地有类似北京大学的这样一些缺点。读了这篇文章，各个学校各个教师，只要肯虚心各自检查，反躬自问一下，就会发现个人和工作中的一些缺点，而加以改进，并得到提高。    王韬
    金克木教授提出的问题
    值得注意编辑同志：我们读了北京大学金克木教授所写“政治学习必须解决实际问题”的文章以后，认为金克木教授能够及时地提出具体的问题来，这是很好的。同时，我们也认为，像金克木教授所举出的“明确的思想领导”问题和“政治思想教育不受重视”问题，是值得注意的；因为上面的问题没能很好地解决，就产生了“各自为政的本位主义”和“庸俗的自由主义习气”。我们觉得这不仅仅是北京大学一校的问题，而是一个带普通性的问题。
    今天高等学校教师的学习运动，目的就是为了从根本上来解决这些问题。我们热烈地欢迎这个学习运动。预祝我们的老师们在思想战线上打一个大胜仗！    北京师范大学二院    任清川    黄智显

    们改造思想的学习寄予
    很大希望编辑同志：我们学校的教授们都踊跃地参加改造思想的学习运动。正如毛主席所说的，这“是我国值得庆贺的新气象”。我们不仅感到非常高兴，而且对教师们的这次学习寄予莫大的希望。
    我们学校过去曾是美帝国主义进行文化侵略的堡垒之一，它的课程是不切合中国广大人民需要的。在抗美援朝运动中，我们的学校由中央人民政府接管；接管以后，在人民政府领导下各方面都有了进步。但是这个进步是不够的，特别教学制度，基本上还是美国的一套，没有加以根本的改革。我们同学经过抗美援朝运动以后，大家都有了不少的进步。这学期开学时又学习了第十五届全国学生代表大会的决议，大家决心做一个德才兼备，体魄强健，具有高度共产主义觉悟水平的干部。而且我们还订立了爱国公约来争取达到这个目标。可是在旧学制还没有改革的情况下，功课繁重，直到现在我们还不能很好地执行政务院关于改善各级学校学生健康状况的决定。我们的睡眠时间不足，运动时间也不够，政治学习自然也难以开展。大家都为这种情形感到苦恼。
    十月二十三日我们学校里传达了周总理的报告，教授、讲师、助教们都积极地参加了。我们都感到兴奋。我们都殷切地希望教师们能在这次学习中得到很大的进步，从而改造旧的不合理的一套美国教学制度，把协和医学院办得更好。

    南开大学学生热烈欢迎教师
    改造思想编辑同志：目前正在开展的高等学校教师的学习运动，引起了我们南开大学同学的密切注意。我们热烈欢迎这一运动的展开。
    解放后两年来，教师们有着很大的进步，但仍有些教师或多或少地残留着欧美资产阶级的思想意识，以超阶级观点进行教学，或机械地搬出从国外学到的一套，不加批判即行讲授。这一运动的开展，使这些错误的思想必将获得大大的改造。
    南开大学的教师们也热烈欢迎这一运动。电机系陈容之教授说：“周总理的报告使我明确地认识到要为谁服务。”物理系副教授杨仲耆说：“听了周总理报告的传达后，我才开始认识到要想在祖国建设中贡献出最大的力量，不但要搞好业务，更重要的是思想改造。我今后一定要努力学习，彻底改造自己。”    南开大学南开新闻社
