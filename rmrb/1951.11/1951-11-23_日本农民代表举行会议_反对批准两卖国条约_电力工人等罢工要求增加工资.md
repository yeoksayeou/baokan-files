(Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 21st dispatch) Tokyo delayed news: In order to oppose the Yoshida government's implementation of the United States' various war preparation plans, Japan's progressive farmers' organization, the Japan Farmers' Association, convened a "National Farmers' Crisis Breakthrough Representative Meeting" in Tokyo on October 26th. Approximately 100 farmer representatives from various prefectures across Japan participated in the meeting.

The slogans of the meeting were: Oppose the abolition of food controls; oppose raising electricity fees, fertilizer prices, transportation costs, etc.; oppose the requisition of land, fishing areas, and personnel for war; workers and farmers unite to overthrow the Yoshida government; oppose the ratification of the treaty of national subjugation; demand the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact.

During the meeting, the representatives pointed out that the increasingly difficult lives of Japanese farmers were the result of the war policies pursued by U.S. imperialism and the reactionary Yoshida government. The representatives cited various experiences to prove that if farmers do not rise up together with the working class to take joint action and strive for national independence, they will not even be able to maintain their livelihoods.

The meeting passed a resolution opposing the ratification of the separate "peace treaty." The resolution stated: Even if the Diet ratifies the separate "peace treaty" and the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," we will not recognize them. The resolution also demanded the conclusion of an overall peace treaty based on the Potsdam Declaration.

The meeting also passed a resolution opposing the requisition of farmers' land for the construction of military bases and opposing the prohibition of fishermen from entering fishing areas for military exercises. Other resolutions passed by the meeting included: opposing the abolition of food controls, opposing power outages and increased electricity fees for agriculture, small and medium-sized enterprises, and residential users, and opposing the enactment of fascist laws.

(Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd dispatch) Tokyo news: Workers in Japan's major industrial sectors, such as electricity, railways, and coal mines, are continuously launching strike struggles demanding wage increases in order to improve their increasingly deteriorating living conditions.

Since October, the Japan Electrical Industry Workers' Union has put forward demands for wage increases to the management. However, this demand was ultimately rejected by the management. Consequently, approximately 125,000 union members launched wave-like strike struggles. These union members, distributed across many power stations nationwide, first held strikes lasting six to ten hours on November 17th. This strike reduced power generation by 560,000 kilowatts. On the 20th, they held a second strike. On the same day, the union also issued an order to all branches nationwide to hold a third strike starting on November 24th. According to Agence France-Presse, the purpose of this strike is to reduce the total power generation in Japan by one-third. At a time when Japan is experiencing an electricity crisis, this strike will deal a severe blow to the Japanese ruling class.

At the same time, after negotiations between the National Railway Workers' Union and the management regarding year-end allowance issues broke down on the 20th, it immediately ordered all union members in the head office and local railway administrations to hold sit-down strikes. The strike continued until the 21st.

Shortly after the end of a nationwide coal miners' strike, more than 70,000 miners from seven coal mines in Hokkaido held a 24-hour strike on the 21st, demanding wage increases.

One of the important reasons for these strikes is the decline in Japanese workers' real wages, which has reached an alarming level. According to Kyodo News Agency's Tokyo dispatch of November 2nd: "Real wages have been trending downward since July, decreasing by 22% in September compared to July. It is expected to decline further in October." Kyodo News Agency admitted: "This profoundly illustrates that workers' lives cannot keep up with rising prices." (Attached image)

On the afternoon of October 20th, approximately 10,000 workers from the National Railway Workers' Union of Japan, the Japan Teachers' Union, the Japan Coal Miners' Union, and more than 40 other union organizations gathered at Shiba Park No. 18 Square in Tokyo to hold the "Japan National Workers' General Uprising Meeting to Break Through the Living Crisis and Oppose Deteriorating Labor Regulations." The participating workers held placards with slogans such as "Oppose Ratification of the Separate Peace Treaty and the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty," "Oppose Deteriorating Labor Regulations," and "Defend Freedom, Peace, and Independence," and their emotions were extremely激昂 (jī'áng: stirred up; vehement; impassioned). A demonstration was held after the meeting.

    日本农民代表举行会议
    反对批准两卖国条约
    电力工人等罢工要求增加工资
    【新华社二十一日讯】东京迟到消息：为了反对吉田政府实行美国的各项备战计划，日本的进步农民组织——日本农民协会，于十月二十六日在东京召开了“全国农民突破危机代表会议”。参加会议的有日本全国各县的农民代表约一百人。
    会议的口号是：反对撤销粮食管制；反对提高电费、肥料价格、运费等；反对为战争而征用土地、捕鱼区和人员；工农联合起来，打倒吉田政府；反对批准亡国的“和约”；要求缔结五大国和平公约。
    在会议中，代表们指出：日本农民生活的日益困苦，是由于美帝国主义和吉田反动政府推行战争政策的结果。代表们举出各种经验证明：农民如果不和工人阶级一道起来用实际行动进行共同斗争，争取民族独立，就会连生活都不能维持了。
    会议通过了关于反对批准单独“和约”的决议。决议声明：即使国会批准了单独“和约”和美日“安全条约”，我们也不予以承认。决议并要求根据波茨坦公告缔结全面和约。
    会议也通过决议，反对为建筑军事基地而征收农民的土地，反对为进行军事演习而禁止渔民进入捕鱼区。会议通过的其他决议有：反对撤销粮食管制，反对对农业、中小企业和家庭用户停电和提高电费，反对制订法西斯法案。
    【新华社二十二日讯】东京消息：日本的电力、铁道、煤矿等主要产业部门的工人群众，为了改善日益恶化的生活状况，不断地展开要求增加工资的罢工斗争。
    自从十月以来，日本电气产业工人工会向资方提出了增加工资的要求。但是，这一要求终于遭到了资方的拒绝。于是，该工会会员约十二万五千人展开了波浪式的罢工斗争。这些分布在全国许多电力站的工会会员们，在十一月十七日首先举行了六小时到十小时的罢工。这一罢工使发电力减少了五十六万瓩。二十日，他们又举行了第二次罢工。同日，工会并向全国各分会发出自十一月二十四日起举行第三次罢工的命令。据法新社讯，这次罢工的目的是要把日本全国总发电力减少三分之一。正当日本发生电力危机的时候，这一罢工将给日本统治阶级严重的打击。
    与此同时，国营铁道工人工会在二十日与资方进行关于年终津贴问题的谈判破裂后，立即命令总公司及各地方铁道管理局的全体工会会员举行静坐罢工。罢工直到二十一日仍在继续中。
    在全国规模的煤矿工人大罢工刚结束不久之后，北海道七个煤矿的七万多名矿工又因要求增加工资，在二十一日举行二十四小时的罢工。
    发生这些罢工的重要原因之一，是日本工人的实际工资的下降，达到了惊人的程度。据共同社东京十一月二日电说：“实际工资自七月以后趋向下降，九月份比七月份减低了百分之二十二。预料十月份将更加低降。”共同社承认：“这深刻地说明劳工生活赶不上升腾的物价。”（附图片）
    十月二十日下午，日本国营铁路工人工会、日本教职员工会、日本煤矿工会等四十余工会单位的工人约一万人聚集在东京市芝公园十八号广场举行“日本全国工人冲破生活危机、反对改劣劳动法规总奋起大会”。参加的工人们手执“反对批准单独和约及美日安全条约”“反对改劣劳动法规”“保卫自由和平与独立”等标语牌，情绪极为激昂。会后并举行了示威游行。
