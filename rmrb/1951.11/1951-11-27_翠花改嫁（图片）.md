    (13) After the meeting, Comrade Wu asked about Cuihua and Ada's matter. The old man just scratched his head and didn't say anything. Comrade Wu then explained to him, "Their union is not harmful and will have a positive effect on labor production."
    (14) Comrade Wu and Old Man Wang had just reached the entrance of the district government when they saw Cuihua and Ada had already arrived. It turned out that Ada, taking advantage of the old man's absence, had invited Cuihua to the district to register for marriage. Under these circumstances, the old man agreed.
    (15) After the marriage, they began a happy life, made this year's production plan, and also prepared to increase production and save one dan of grain to support the Chinese People's Volunteers. (The End)
