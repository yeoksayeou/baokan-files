    We Should Vigorously Publicize the Marriage Law

    Editor: Since the promulgation of the Marriage Law, many marriage disputes have been reasonably resolved in various places, and many men and women have freely married. However, at present, there are still many serious problems in some areas, and the suffering of women is still quite profound. In the Lutang District of Fengyang County, Northern Anhui, six women committed suicide in half a month in August alone. There are also many parents who force or coax their daughters to marry in order to profit from it. For example, Ding Shusan, a farmer from Dingjia Village in Fengyang County, married his seventeen-year-old daughter to a twenty-eight-year-old man, Zhu Xicai, in February of this year, and received a bride price of 360,000 yuan in Renminbi. There are also many cases of abuse of women. For example, the woman Xu Huanmei was arranged by her parents to marry Jin Yunwu, a thirty-six-year-old landlord from Jindong Village, as a second wife when she was twenty years old. She was often beaten and suffered after the marriage. On September 29th, she was beaten all over with a stick by Jin Yunwu on the street. Fortunately, Zhong Kai, the director of the County Women's Federation who was working in the countryside, saw it and introduced her to the Fengyang County People's Court to file a complaint. The court has now detained Jin Yunwu.

    In order to correct this phenomenon of abuse of women and correctly implement the Marriage Law, I suggest: 1. Cadres at all levels of districts and townships, especially cadres of the Women's Federation, should study the Marriage Law and related documents on the Marriage Law. While studying, they should conduct self-examination. They should also lead village cadres to study the Marriage Law, so that they realize that publicizing and implementing the Marriage Law is one of their regular tasks. 2. Heads of governments at all levels should arrange the promotion of the Marriage Law as a task at various meetings; Party and League organizations should promote propagandists in rural areas to publicize the Marriage Law; mass organizations, especially the Women's Federation, should publicize the Marriage Law, and conduct timely inspections and report regularly, so that the Marriage Law is known to every household in rural areas.

    应该大力宣传婚姻法
    编辑同志：婚姻法颁布以后，各地曾合理地解决了很多婚姻纠纷，也有很多男女自由结了婚。但是，目前在某些地区还有不少严重问题，妇女的痛苦，还相当深重。皖北凤阳县鹿塘区，在八月份半个月中就有六名妇女自杀身死。还有不少父母强迫或哄骗女儿结婚，自己从中取利。如凤阳县丁家庄农民丁树三，在本年二月将自己十七岁的女儿说给一个二十八岁的男子朱锡才，得彩礼人民币三十六万元。虐待妇女的事情也很多。如妇女徐焕美，二十岁时被父母包办说给金东村三十六岁的地主金云伍为填房妻，婚后经常挨打受气。她在九月二十九日又被金云伍在街上用棍子打得浑身是伤，幸被下乡工作的县妇女联合会主任仲凯看见，才介绍到凤阳县人民法院申诉。现法院已将金云伍拘押。
    为了纠正这种虐待妇女现象，正确执行婚姻法，我建议：一、各级区乡干部，特别是妇女联合会干部要学习婚姻法和有关婚姻法的文件。一面学习，一面进行自我检查。并领导村干部学习婚姻法，使他们认识到宣传执行婚姻法是经常任务之一。二、各级政府首长要在各种会议上将宣传婚姻法作为一项工作布置下去；党团组织要推动农村中的宣传员宣传婚姻法，群众团体特别是妇女联合会更要宣传婚姻法，并按时检查，定期汇报，使婚姻法在农村中家喻户晓。
