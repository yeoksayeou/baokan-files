　　Reasonable Logging and Utilization of Dabie Mountains Timber Should Be Implemented
    Editor: The Dabie Mountains area of the Lu'an Special District in northern Anhui is one of China's timber resource areas. However, due to the imperfect forestry administration organs, there are still many serious waste phenomena in the timber logging in this area. For example, the Zhufo'an, Wuqihe, and Dabieshe branches of the cooperative under the jurisdiction of Huoshan County in Lu'an Special District, and the Mabu, Liubotuan, and Jinzhai Chengguan branches of the cooperative in Jinzhai County, saw the century-old, tall and straight trees into square boards that are seven to ten feet long and one point eight to two inches thick. This is using large timber for small purposes and is a great waste. Furthermore, tall trees in the mountains of this area are rarely cut down due to transportation difficulties, but farmers often extract pine oil from the trees for sale, causing the trees to gradually die. In remote mountain areas, the trees are left to age and rot without anyone caring. In order to ensure the rational logging and utilization of timber in the Dabie Mountains area, we suggest that the local forestry administration organs, in addition to promptly stopping the wasteful phenomena such as indiscriminate felling and using large timber for small purposes, should also organize the existing sawmill workers and the masses in the area in a planned manner to go deep into the remote mountainous areas for logging, sawing them into various timber suitable for construction purposes and easy to transport for future use. This will not only ensure the rational use of timber in the Dabie Mountains area, but also solve the livelihood problems of the farmers in the entire mountainous area.

　　应合理采伐和使用大别山林木
    编辑同志：皖北六安专区大别山一带是我国木材资源地之一，但是由于林政机关尚不健全，这一带的木材采伐，仍然存在着许多严重的浪费现象。如六安专区霍山县合作社所属的诸佛庵、舞旗河、大别舍等分社，及金寨县合作社的麻埠、流波疃、金寨城关等分社，把百年合抱的高大粗直树木锯成长七尺至一丈、厚一寸八分至二寸的方板，这是大材小用，是一种很大的浪费。又如该区山内高大树木，因运输困难，被砍伐的很少，但农民往往在树内采挖松油出售，致使树身逐渐死亡。偏僻山区的树木，则任其衰老、腐朽，无人过问。为了使大别山区的木材得到合理的砍伐和使用，我们建议该地林政机关除应迅速制止滥砍滥伐、大材小用等浪费现象外，并应把该地现有的锯木工人和群众有计划地组织起来，深入偏僻山区进行采伐，分别锯成各种适合建筑用途而又便于运输的成材，运出备用。这样不仅使大别山区的木材得到合理使用，而且也能解决整个山区农民的生活问题。
