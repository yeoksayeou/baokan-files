　　Shijingshan Steel Plant
    New Look in Production After Wage Adjustment
    Comrade Editor: The Shijingshan Steel Plant reformed its old, unreasonable wage system in September, replacing it with a new, reasonable eight-grade wage system. This reasonable measure taken by the plant has further enhanced the class consciousness of the workers, and as a result, the entire plant has taken on a brand-new look.
    The pipe casting department completed its annual pipe production task 79 days ahead of schedule. As of recently, Yang Jingqi's group has created a new record of 105 days with a 100% finished product rate in sand casting. Veteran workers like Wang Guoan and others studied the operation methods of the eight-character wheel milling machine, which had not been running for eight years, and finally put the milling machine into production. Because the workers know the direction of their technical efforts, a wave of technical learning has been set off in all departments. For example, the sand casting workshop in the casting department bought a batch of technical books, which were immediately distributed. Many staff members of the coking department also took time to participate in the study of a coking training class. The number of students in the plant's spare-time school has increased by more than 1,000 this semester.　Xu Bingzhong

　　石景山钢铁厂
    调整工资后生产出现新气象
    编辑同志：石景山钢铁厂于九月份改革了旧的不合理的工资制度，而代之以新的合理的八级工资制。该厂这一合理的措施，使职工的阶级觉悟更提高了一步，因而全厂已呈现了崭新的气象。
    该厂铸管部提前七十九天完成了全年生产管子的任务；杨景琪小组到最近止，创造了一百零五天翻砂成品率百分之一百的新纪录。老工友王国安等研究八年来未曾运转的八字轮铣床的操作法，终于使该铣床投入了生产。由于工人们知道了自己在技术上的努力方向，所以各部分都掀起了学习技术的热潮，比如铸造部翻砂场买来一批技术书籍，一下就分光了；炼焦部的许多职员也抽出时间参加某炼焦训练班的学习；该厂业余学校这一学期的学员增加了一千多人。　徐炳忠
