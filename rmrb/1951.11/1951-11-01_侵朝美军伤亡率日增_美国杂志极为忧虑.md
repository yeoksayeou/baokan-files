Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 31st: The magazine "U.S. News & World Report," published on October 26th, expressed concern about the increasing casualties of U.S. troops in the Korean War of aggression and complained that the United States' satellite countries were not doing enough.

In the face of the growing strength of the Chinese and Korean People's forces, the magazine is extremely troubled by the increasingly heavy casualties suffered by U.S. forces in the Korean War. It wrote: "Now it is the U.S. military that is paying a huge price and suffering heavy casualties, but if the war continues, they will pay an even greater price in the coming winter. The relative proportion of American casualties tends to increase every week. Most allies have not replenished their dead and wounded. No country has greatly increased its troops sent to Korea... The scale of air combat is also expanding. It can be predicted that the United States will suffer greater and greater losses in air combat. In other words, the Korean War has this trend: it is increasingly becoming a war that places a heavy burden on the United States." The magazine expressed great dissatisfaction with the fact that various U.S. satellite countries were procrastinating and unwilling to provide more assistance to the United States, saying: "In the final analysis, the United States, with a population of 150 million, bears a far greater loss in young ground troops than the United Nations allies (referring to countries helping the U.S. to invade Korea) with a population of 240 million. The ratio of U.S. deaths and injuries to the deaths and injuries of United Nations allies is now about thirteen to one, and is gradually increasing every week."

    侵朝美军伤亡率日增
    美国杂志极为忧虑
    【新华社布拉格三十一日电】十月二十六日出版的“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志对美军在朝鲜侵略战争中日益增加的伤亡表示忧虑，并抱怨美国的卫星国不够卖力。
    在朝中人民部队力量日益壮大的情况下，该杂志对朝鲜战争使美军遭受愈来愈重的伤亡感到极其困恼。它写道：“现在付出巨大代价和重大伤亡的是美军，但假如战争打下去的话，他们在即将到来的冬季中将付出更大代价。美国伤亡的相对比例每一个星期都有增加的趋向。大多数盟国并未补充它们死伤的人员。没有一国大大增加它运往朝鲜的部队……空战规模也正在扩大中。可以预料，美国在空战中的损失将愈来愈大。换句话说，朝鲜战争有这样的趋势：它越来越成为使美国负荷重担的一个战争了。”该杂志对于美国各卫星国多方推诿，不肯给美国提供更多援助的事实大为不满地说：“归根结底说来，人口一亿五千万的美国，在地面部队青年的损失上要承担远大于人口二亿四千万的联合国盟国（按指助美出兵侵朝各国）的损失。美国死伤人数与联合国盟国的死伤人数的比例现在约为十三比一，并且每周正在逐渐增加中。”
