Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 27th: This reporter reports: Another American prisoner of war used the facts he witnessed to prove that the American invaders inhumanely abused and killed captured personnel of our army. This prisoner of war is named Edison Phillips. Before being captured, he was an infantryman in the First Company of the 19th Infantry Regiment of the 24th Division of the U.S. Army, and his military number was R.A.-11179178. He recently revealed the crimes of the US military in writing. He said: "I arrived in Korea on July 4, 1950. Since then, I have seen our army commit many evil deeds in Korea, such as rape and looting. The worst of these was seeing some North Korean prisoners buried alive or beaten to death. In October 1950, on our way from South Korea to North Korea, we stayed in a city. The officers appointed some South Korean soldiers as military police to do their dirty work for them. These military police tortured North Korean prisoners every day, sometimes breaking their arms and legs. When we first saw this, my companions and I were very surprised. We often wondered why those officers would allow this to happen. But after these things were discovered by us, our officers forbade us to go to this place. They dared not make these things public. Once an officer ordered me to go outside the city to deliver a letter. As I was walking out of the city, I heard a terrible commotion. I ran over to take a look, and it turned out that several military policemen were busy burying North Korean prisoners alive. They wouldn't let me watch, but I still stood there. They threw the North Korean prisoners into the pit and then filled it with soil. I saw the hands and legs of the North Korean prisoners sticking out of the soil, and the military police cut off their hands and legs with long knives. After I came back, I told my officer what I had seen. Afterwards, not only did they not deal with this matter, but they forbade me to take that road. The next morning, I saw two military policemen shooting North Korean prisoners again. I can't remember the name of the place, but I know that place was in South Korea. On another occasion, we captured six North Korean prisoners, and the officer ordered two military policemen to send the prisoners to the camp headquarters for 'military law trial'. The military police set off with the prisoners. Before long, we heard gunshots. We ran over to take a look, and it turned out that the six North Koreans who had just been captured had been shot."

    又一个美俘用目睹的事实揭发
    美军虐杀我被俘人员
    【新华社平壤二十七日电】本社记者报道：又一个美国俘虏用他目睹的事实，证明美国侵略者丧失人性地虐待和杀害我军被俘人员。这个俘虏名叫爱得生·菲力浦。他被俘前在美军第二十四师第十九步兵团第一连当步兵，军号是R·A·一一一七九一七八。他在最近书面揭发了美军的罪行。他说：“我是在一九五○年七月四日到朝鲜的。从那时起，我便看到了我们军队在朝鲜作了不少罪恶的事，如强奸、掠夺等。其中最糟糕的便是我看到一些北朝鲜俘虏被活埋或被活活打死。一九五○年十月，我们从南朝鲜开向北朝鲜的途中，住在一个城市里。军官们就指定一些南朝鲜军做宪兵，来替他们做那些肮脏的事情。这些宪兵天天拷打北朝鲜俘虏，有时还打断了俘虏们的手臂和腿。当我们初次见到这件事时，我的伙伴们和我都感到非常惊奇。我们时常想，为什么那些军官们会允许这种事情发生。但当这些事被我们发现后，我们的军官便禁止我们到这地方去了。他们不敢公开这些事。有一次军官命令我到城外去送信。当我正走出城的时候，我听到一阵可怖的骚动声。我跑去一看，原来是几个宪兵正在忙着活埋北朝鲜俘虏。他们不允许我看，但我仍旧站在那里。他们把北朝鲜俘虏扔在坑里，然后再用土填上。我看到北朝鲜俘虏的手和腿从土里钻出来，宪兵们便用长刀把手和腿砍断。我回来后，就把我见到的事情告诉我的军官。以后，他们不但没有对这事加以处理，反而不准我走那条路了。第二天早上，我又看见两个宪兵在枪毙北朝鲜俘虏。我记不住那地方的名字，但我知道那个地方是在南朝鲜。又一次，我们捉到了六个北朝鲜俘虏，军官叫两个宪兵把俘虏送到营司令部去‘军法裁判’。宪兵带着俘虏出发了。不一会，我们便听到枪声。我们跑去一看，原来就是刚才被俘的六个北朝鲜人被枪毙了。”
