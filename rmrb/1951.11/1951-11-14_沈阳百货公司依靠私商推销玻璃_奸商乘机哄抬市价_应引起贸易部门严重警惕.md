　　Shenyang Department Store Relies on Private Merchants to Promote Glass
    Profiteers Take the Opportunity to Drive Up Prices
    Trade Departments Should Be Highly Vigilant
    Shenyang Department Store abandoned its leadership responsibility and relied on private merchants to promote glass without providing necessary management and supervision, resulting in an abnormal phenomenon of excessive public-private price differences in the Shenyang glass market. Glass is one of the commodities under the unified control of state-owned commerce. State-owned commerce should actively expand the direct retail portion to lead various economic forces and ensure market supply. However, Shenyang Department Store only has one wholesale outlet in Shenyang, which has neither samples nor stock. Most of the glass sold by Shenyang Department Store is wholesale to private glass merchants, who then wholesale it in boxes to consumers. Shenyang Department Store only assumes the responsibility of "sufficient supply" to private glass merchants, without necessary control over the sales prices of private merchants, resulting in some illegal glass merchants taking the opportunity to raise prices. In the first and middle ten days of October, Shenyang Department Store successively supplied the Glass Trade Association with 4,560 boxes of various types of glass. The company's own inventory was less than the amount supplied to private merchants, and the specifications were incomplete. Therefore, the price of glass in the Shenyang market was controlled by private merchants, and illegal profiteers took the opportunity to drive up prices. In late October, the market price of glass in Shenyang was 42% higher than the state-owned company's list price. This serious situation has not received due attention from Shenyang Department Store and the Shenyang Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce. Some responsible business personnel even believe: "The state has so much glass, the market price cannot fluctuate!" Individual personnel even mistakenly believe: "The state supplies private merchants, and private merchants supply consumers, there is no problem!" After discovering this problem, the Northeast China Department Store Company has given the company strict criticism and emphasized: In order to fully exert the material strength of state-owned trade, it is necessary to improve the organization of sales business. It is necessary to appropriately increase wholesale institutions, reduce wholesale units, organize trust companies and cooperatives to promote sales, and implement direct supply to the construction industry, institutions, and organizations. For private glass merchants, reasonable supply should be provided under the condition of controlling selling prices.

　　沈阳百货公司依靠私商推销玻璃
    奸商乘机哄抬市价
    应引起贸易部门严重警惕
    沈阳市百货公司放弃领导责任，依靠私商推销玻璃，但不加以必要的管理与监督，结果形成沈阳玻璃市场上公私差价过大的畸形现象。玻璃是国营商业统一掌握的商品之一。国营商业原应积极扩大直接零售的部分，以领导各种经济力量，作好市场供应。但沈阳市百货公司在沈阳只设有一个批发门市部，这个批发门市部既无样品，又无现货。沈阳市百货公司所卖的玻璃，绝大部分是批发给私营玻璃商，再由这些玻璃商成箱批发给消费者。沈阳市百货公司对私营玻璃商仅负“充分供应”的责任，对于私商销货价格，并无必要的管制，致某些不法玻璃商即乘机抬高价格。十月份上、中旬沈阳市百货公司先后供给玻璃同业公会各种玻璃四千五百六十箱，该公司本身所存现货，却少于供给私商的数量，而且规格不全。因此沈阳玻璃市场价格为私商所掌握，不法奸商乘机哄抬市价。十月下旬，沈阳玻璃市价竟高于国营公司牌价百分之四十二。这一严重情况，并未引起沈阳市百货公司和沈阳市工商管理部门应有的重视。有的业务负责人员还认为：“国家有这样多的玻璃，市价波动不了！”个别人员甚至错误地认为：“国家供给私商，私商供给消费者，没有问题！”东北区百货公司发现这一问题后，已经给予该公司以严格批评，并强调指出：为了充分发挥国营贸易的物资力量，必须改善推销业务的组织工作。要适当增加批发机构，缩小批发单位，组织信托公司、合作社推销，并对建筑业、机关、团体等实行直接供应。对于私营玻璃商，要在管制卖价的条件下合理供应。
