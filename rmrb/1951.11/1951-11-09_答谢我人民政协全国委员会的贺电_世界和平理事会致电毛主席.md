Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 8th: After receiving the message of congratulations from the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the resolution on supporting the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers, the World Peace Council's Second Session sent a telegram on the 6th to Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The text of the telegram is as follows:

Mr. Chairman:

The World Peace Council, meeting in Vienna from November 1st to 6th, was delighted to receive your telegram of November 1st, which conveyed the decision of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference expressing full agreement with the World Peace Council's declaration on the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers. This has deeply moved us.

The World Peace Council considers it a very important event that your conference has agreed to this declaration and expressed the will of the more than 344 million people in your country who have signed the World Peace Council's declaration.

We know that we are making a great contribution to turning the situation in favor of peace, and our worldwide movement to demand that the five major powers conclude a peace pact is one of the most important actions exerting great pressure on the forces of war.

We are convinced that the continuous actions of the people of the world to strive for peace will eventually triumph and promote the conclusion of a peace pact by the People's Republic of China, the United States, the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and France.

Mr. Chairman, please accept the respects of the World Peace Council and convey these respects to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and, through you, to all the Chinese people.
