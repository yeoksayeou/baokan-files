    Thoroughly Expose Waste in Production Processes
    The waste in the production processes of Shanghai's state-owned cotton textile factories is very serious. According to preliminary statistics, the losses caused by waste amount to 150 billion yuan annually, enough to buy one hundred fighter planes. This fact once again illustrates that eliminating waste in production processes is a serious task in the increased production and thrift movement.
    The first step in eliminating waste in production processes is to first expose all kinds of waste. Without exposing waste, there is no way to find ways to reduce and eliminate it. To expose waste in the production process, it is necessary to mobilize all employees and launch an anti-waste movement on a full scale. Relying solely on administrative cadres will not uncover all the problems. Only by relying on workers directly involved in production, relying on workers who understand every production detail and the specific situation in the factory, is it possible to expose every small point of waste and formulate practical and feasible methods to eliminate waste.

    彻底揭发生产过程中的浪费现象
    上海国营棉纺织工厂生产过程中的浪费是很严重的。据初步统计，每年因浪费造成的损失达一千五百亿元，可买一百架战斗机。这一事实再度说明，消灭生产过程中的浪费现象，是增产节约运动中的严重任务。
    消灭生产过程中的浪费现象的第一步，是首先把各种各样的浪费揭发出来。不揭发浪费，就无法找出减少与消灭浪费的途径。要揭发生产过程中的浪费，必须发动全体职工，展开一个全体规模的反浪费运动。单靠行政干部是不能把所有的问题都发现出来的。只有依靠直接生产的工人，依靠了解每一个生产细节及工厂中的具体情况的工人，才有可能把每一点细小的浪费都揭发出来，并订出切实可行的消灭浪费的办法。
