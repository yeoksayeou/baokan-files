Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 27th: The Third All-Soviet Peace Congress opened grandly at 6:00 PM on November 27th in the Pillar Hall of the Trade Union Building in Moscow. More than a thousand delegates, selected by the Soviet people, came to participate in the congress, representing all the republics, border regions, and states of the Soviet Union. They are workers, farmers, renowned scientists, clergy, students, writers, and artists. Many guests, representatives of the working people of the Soviet capital, also attended the opening ceremony.

Above the rostrum hung huge portraits of the leaders of the Soviet people, Lenin and Stalin. Red banners displayed slogans such as "Struggle for Peace" and "Strengthen International Friendship." The presidium included N.A. Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences; Nikolai Tikhonov, Chairman of the Soviet Peace Committee; writers Ilya Ehrenburg, Konstantin Fedin, and Mikhail Sholokhov; famous Stakhanovite workers Rossiisky and Mushtukova; and Hero of Socialist Labor, collective farm woman Marinin. Paul-Émile Victor, member of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council and President of the French National Peace Council, attending the congress as a representative of the World Peace Council, and Han Sorya, Chairman of the National Committee of the Korean Peace Supporters, currently visiting Moscow, were also elected to the presidium.

The delegates very warmly elected the members of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), headed by Stalin, leader of all working humanity and great standard-bearer of peace, as honorary presidium.

Academician Grekov delivered a brief opening speech to the congress.

He said: We have gathered here to once again declare the unyielding will of the Soviet people to support international peace and friendship, and to expose the conspiracies of the imperialist warmongers.

Academician Grekov said: People all over the world cherish peace, freedom, and the future of mankind. They have deep confidence in the strength of the peace movement and in the possibility of avoiding another world war.

The agenda of the congress was then adopted as follows: The Soviet Peace Committee's report on the results of the Soviet Union's signature collection for the World Peace Council's declaration calling for the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact, and the current tasks of the struggle to defend peace.

Nikolai Tikhonov, Chairman of the Soviet Peace Committee and writer, delivered the report. He said: By signing the historic declaration of the World Peace Council calling for the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact, the Soviet people and all progressive forces of humanity have expressed their firm will to wage tireless and sustained struggle for international peace and friendship. He said: The signature campaign in the Soviet Union has been nationwide in scope, with 117,669,320 Soviet citizens having signed the World Peace Council's declaration.

Tikhonov said: The results of the Soviet Union's signature collection for the declaration calling for the conclusion of a peace pact prove the Soviet people's love of peace and their unyielding will to cooperate with all countries and to safeguard and strengthen peace. Peace supporters in all countries regard the Soviet people as reliable allies in the great struggle to defend peace and the security of all countries.

Tikhonov concluded his report by saying: We will continue to strengthen the sacred and inviolable friendship of all the nationalities of our country, and bear in mind that the friendship of the Soviet nationalities created by Lenin and Stalin is a brilliant model for the people of all countries and all nations. We sincerely declare to the people of all countries: Regardless of all the insidious reactionary and war forces that are trying to incite people to kill each other, let us strengthen the friendly relations between countries. We are in favor of consolidating and expanding economic and trade relations with other countries. We will further expand and strengthen the ranks of international peace supporters.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 28th: The Third All-Soviet Peace Congress opened in Moscow on November 27th. The congress heard a report by Nikolai Tikhonov, Chairman of the Soviet Peace Committee and writer, on the achievements of the Soviet Union's signature campaign for the World Peace Council's declaration calling for the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact, and the current tasks of the peace struggle.

During the discussion of this report, Academician N.A. Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, spoke first. He said that Soviet scientists cannot allow scientific discoveries and inventions to be turned into terrible tools of murder, into tools for destroying cultural treasures accumulated over centuries, into something that threatens not only all of culture but also the very survival of mankind on Earth, according to the interests of the imperialist bloc. We oppose war, not because we are weak, but because peace is necessary for humanity. We will be able to repel any crazy attempt by the imperialists to launch a new war. All the efforts and knowledge of Soviet scientists are devoted to peaceful construction, to preparing the material and technical foundations for a communist society. The Soviet people only want to engage in one war—a war against the blind forces of nature; they only want to achieve one conquest—man's conquest of nature. Academician Nesmeyanov pointed out that Soviet youth are educated in the spirit of humanism, love of country, and respect for all other nationalities. He emphasized that the Soviet people respect scientists of all times and all countries, as long as their contributions are conducive to progress and beneficial to mankind. The Soviet Academy of Sciences cordially receives progressive foreign scientists, opening the doors of its research institutions to them to facilitate their understanding of the organization of Soviet research work, the methods of organizing Soviet science, and the methods of training scientific personnel.

Korolev, a famous Moscow bricklayer who won the Stalin Prize, spoke at the meeting, talking about the huge construction underway in the capital, about the capital's new, beautiful streets and magnificent, tall buildings. Korolev said: The labor of the Soviet people is not for destruction, but for construction. The goal of our labor is clear and noble. We have experienced the disasters of war, we have seen smoke-filled ruins, and we have heard the painful cries of orphans. We know what war is like, and we ask that all ordinary people in the world unite under the noble banner of peace. Our country is strong, and the Soviet people have never been afraid of anything. We know that Stalin is with us, and Stalin is victory. We do not beg for peace, we demand peace, and we say this loudly and calmly from the podium of our meeting, so that everyone can hear it.

The writer Mosashvili, Chairman of the Georgian Republic Peace Protection Committee, spoke on behalf of the Georgian people, explaining that the Georgian people are united in the struggle to defend peace and the security of all countries and against the vicious plans of the instigators of another war. He said: The life of the working people of Georgia is filled with the enthusiasm of peaceful construction work. There are construction scaffolding everywhere in the Georgian Republic. Cities and villages are being improved, and new factories are starting production one after another. The Soviet people are not building naval and air bases on the borders of the United States and Britain. They are not threatening anyone with atomic bombs. The Soviet people are engaged in peaceful construction and strive to consolidate universal peace. Defending peace is the most glorious task of our generation. The task of defending peace has made the peace and democracy camp into an excellent fortress, and all the conspiracies of the American and British warmongers will be shattered on this fortress.

The next speaker was Hero of Socialist Labor, collective farm chairman Marina from the Kostroma region. She said that she had just returned from participating in the celebrations commemorating the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. She said: I felt even more strongly there the hope that the working people of the world have in us, and their trust in the powerful Soviet Union. Marina spoke at the meeting about the happy and prosperous lives of the farmers in her collective farm and their work. She said: The farmers of our collective farm are wholeheartedly in favor of peace. We firmly believe that peace will triumph over war.

Alexius, Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia, also delivered a speech at the meeting. He said: The Russian Orthodox Church sincerely strives to help maintain and consolidate world peace, congratulates the Third All-Soviet Peace Congress on its success, and blesses the efforts and determination of the congress to fight for the defense of peace until victory. The Russian Orthodox Church, together with all the people, firmly and unwaveringly fights for the defense of peace and supports the cause of peace. It constantly calls on all Christians, regardless of denomination, to fulfill their duty as Christians—to defend peace. Patriarch Alexius said: The Russian Church supports the declaration of the World Peace Council with the greatest enthusiasm, which is in line with the requirements of international cooperation. Patriarch Alexius added: The scale and the spirit of unity of this congress prove that our great people have responded to the call of the leader, truly taken on the cause of peace, and are determined to fight for it until complete victory is achieved. We firmly support peace and firmly believe that we will be able to maintain peace. We are now fighting for the just cause of world peace, and we must repeat with confidence Stalin's insightful saying: "Our cause is a just cause, and we will surely win!"

The last speaker at the first meeting of the congress was Kalizhnyuk, director of the Turkmen Grand Canal Construction Project. Kalizhnyuk said: Our construction work is the most vivid proof of the peace-loving policy of the Soviet state and government, and the Soviet state's government has only one goal, which is to build communism. Kalizhnyuk said: The days when the desert attacked mankind and mankind was powerless are over. Today, the Soviet people have armed themselves with the latest technology and are attacking the desert. He explained in detail the benefits of the Turkmen Grand Canal (the Turkmen Grand Canal is one of the great communist construction projects) to the Soviet motherland. The workers engaged in the canal construction project signed the World Peace Council's declaration, declaring their unwavering determination to uphold peace. Kalizhnyuk said: The workers engaged in the canal construction project asked me to convey to all the delegates attending the congress that they will do everything in their power to strive to complete one of the largest development plans of the Stalin era in the shortest possible time, so that the vast desert areas of Central Asia can gain vitality.

The congress is scheduled to continue on the 28th.

    格列科夫院士向大会致简短的开会词。

    接着通过了大会的议程如下：苏联拥护和平委员会关于苏联为世界和平理事会要求缔结五大国和平公约宣言征集签名的结果以及保卫和平斗争的当前任务的报告。
    苏联拥护和平委员会主席、作家吉洪诺夫作了报告。他说：苏联人民与人类的一切进步势力，由于在世界和平理事会要求缔结五大国和平公约的历史性的宣言上签了名，就表示了他们要为国际和平与友好而作不倦的和持续的斗争的坚定意志。他说：签名运动在苏联有着遍及全国的性质，苏联已有一亿一千七百六十六万九千三百二十个苏维埃公民在世界和平理事会的宣言上签了名。

    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十八日电：全苏第三届拥护和平大会十一月二十七日在莫斯科开幕。大会听取了苏联拥护和平委员会主席、作家吉洪诺夫关于苏联为世界和平理事会要求缔结五大国和平公约宣言征集签名的运动的成就以及和平斗争的当前任务的报告。
    在讨论这个报告的时候，首先发言的是苏联著名科学家、苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫院士。他说，苏联科学家不能允许科学的发现和发明按照帝国主义者集团的利益变成可怕的杀人工具，变成摧毁多少世纪中积累起来的文化珍宝的工具，变成不仅威胁整个文化而且威胁人类在地球上的生存的东西。我们反对战争，并不是因为我们软弱，而是因为和平为人类所必需。我们将能够击退帝国主义者任何发动新战争的疯狂尝试。苏联科学家的一切努力和知识都用于进行和平建设，用于为共产主义社会准备物质的和技术的基础。苏联人民只愿意从事一种战争——对盲目的自然力的战争；只愿意进行一种征服——人征服自然。涅斯米扬诺夫院士指出：苏联的青年是在人道主义、爱祖国、尊重其他各族人民的精神下教养大的。他着重指出：苏联人民敬重一切时代和一切国家的科学家，只要他们的贡献有利于进步和有益于人类。苏联科学院殷勤地接待进步的外国科学家，对他们敞开自己的研究机关的大门，以便利他们了解苏联研究工作的组织、苏联科学的组织方法和训练科学人员的办法。
    荣获斯大林奖金的著名的莫斯科砌砖工人科罗列夫在会上讲话，他谈到正在首都进行的巨大建设，谈到首都新的美丽的街道和雄伟高大的建筑物。科罗列夫说：苏联人民的劳动不是为了破坏，而是为了建设。我们劳动的目标是明确而高尚的。我们经历过战争的灾难，我们看见过烟雾弥漫的废墟，我们听到过孤儿们痛苦的呼号。我们知道战争是怎样的，我们要求世界上所有普通的老百姓团结在和平的高尚旗帜下。我们国家是强大的，苏联人民从来都不害怕任何事情。我们知道斯大林和我们在一起，而斯大林就是胜利。我们并不乞求和平，我们是要求和平，我们在我们会议的讲台上大声地镇静地说这句话，让所有的人都能听得到。
    乔治亚共和国拥护和平委员会主席、作家摩萨施维里代表乔治亚人民讲话，他说明乔治亚人民在保卫和平与各国的安全、反对另一次战争挑拨者的凶恶计划的斗争中是团结一致的。他说：乔治亚劳动人民的生活，充满着和平建设的劳动的热情。乔治亚共和国到处都有建筑的鹰架。城市和村庄正在改善，新的工厂纷纷开工生产。苏联人民并没有在美国和英国边境建筑海空军基地。他们并没有用原子弹威胁任何人。苏联人民正从事和平建设并力求巩固普遍的和平。保卫和平是我们这一代最光荣的任务。保卫和平这个任务已经使得和平民主阵营变成一个极好的堡垒，美英战争贩子们的一切阴谋诡计都将粉碎在这个堡垒上。
    下一个发言的是社会主义劳动英雄、科斯特罗马州集体农场主席玛里寗娜。她说，她最近刚刚参加中华人民共和国建国两周年纪念庆祝典礼回来。她说：我在那里更强烈地感到全世界劳动人民对我们抱有的希望，以及他们对于强大的苏联的信赖。玛里寗娜在会议上谈到她的集体农场的农民的幸福优裕的生活和他们的工作。她说：我们集体农场的农民是全心全意拥护和平的。我们坚决相信和平将要战胜战争。
    莫斯科及全俄罗斯总主教阿列修斯也在会议上发表了演说。他说：俄罗斯东正教真心诚意地为协助保持和巩固世界和平而努力，祝贺全苏第三届拥护和平大会成功，并祝福大会的愿为保卫和平而战斗到胜利为止的努力和决心。俄罗斯东正教教会和全体人民一起坚定不移地为保卫和平而战斗，并且拥护和平事业。它不断地号召全体基督教徒，不管派别如何，都要履行他们作为基督教徒的职责——保卫和平。阿列修斯总主教说：俄罗斯的教会以最大的热情支持世界和平理事会的宣言，这个宣言是符合国际合作的要求的。阿列修斯总主教又说：这次大会的规模和团结一致的精神，证明我国伟大的人民已经响应了领袖的号召，真正把和平事业担当了起来，决心为它奋斗，直到取得完全的胜利。我们坚定不移地拥护和平，坚决相信我们必能坚持和平。我们现在正在为世界和平这一个正义的事业进行斗争，我们要满怀信心地重复一次斯大林的具有远见的名言，他说：“我们的事业是正义的事业，我们一定能胜利！”
    在大会第一次会议上最后发言的，是土库曼大运河建筑工程处处长卡利日尼乌克。卡利日尼乌克说：我们的建设工作，最生动地证明了苏维埃国家和政府的爱好和平的政策，苏维埃国家的政府只有一个目标，就是建设共产主义。卡利日尼乌克说：沙漠向人类进攻而人类无能为力的时候已经过去了。今天，苏联人民用最新式的技术武装了自己，正在向沙漠进攻。他详细说明了土库曼大运河（土库曼大运河是伟大的共产主义建筑工程之一）对于苏维埃祖国的好处。担任运河建筑工程的工人们，在世界和平理事会的宣言上签了名，宣布了他们坚持和平的不屈不挠的决心。卡利日尼乌克说：担任运河建筑工程的工人们，托我转告参加大会的全体代表们，他们要尽所有的力量争取在最短的期间内完成斯大林时代最大开发计划之一，使中亚广大的沙漠地区获得生机。
    大会定于二十八日继续开会。
