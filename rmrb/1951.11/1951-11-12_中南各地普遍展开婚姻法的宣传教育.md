    Marriage Law Propaganda and Education Universally Unfolded in Central and Southern China

    Marriage Law propaganda and education activities are being universally unfolded in Central and Southern China. Responsible persons from local democratic women's federations, judicial departments, courts, etc., have made special reports on the Marriage Law at various meetings, and organized cadres and representatives from all walks of life to study it. Relevant cadres in most counties in Hubei and Henan, and in some counties in other provinces, have made the Marriage Law one of the main contents of their current study. After studying the Marriage Law, the relevant departments in Hunan Province, Jiangxi Province, Wuhan City, and some special districts and counties in various provinces have sent inspection teams to conduct巡回 inspections in various places.

    In implementing the Marriage Law, various methods are used for propaganda and education in various places. After the Wulijie District of Wuchang County, Hubei Province, the Chengguan District of Mianyang County, and the Anxi District of Xinfeng County, Jiangxi Province, carried out Marriage Law propaganda, there were 353 couples who freely married in August, September, and October. Among them, some dissolved unreasonable marriage relationships in accordance with the spirit of the Marriage Law before remarrying; and some were widows who remarried. Government cadres used these examples to educate the masses. In Anxi District, Xinfeng County, Jiangxi Province, 55 pairs of young men and women held a collective wedding in the auditorium of the district government on October 15. When local residents came to watch the ceremony, the person in charge of the district government promoted the Marriage Law. The bride and groom also voluntarily explained their love story to the masses who came to watch the ceremony. This propaganda method was very effective. In Yuesheng Village, Pingle County, Guangxi, a pair of former farmhands and maids who had worked for landlords for ten years held their wedding at the village's celebration meeting for the victory of rent reduction and deposit refund, which was presided over by the Farmers' Association, expanding the influence of the Marriage Law. Songzi County in Hubei Province and Yiyang, Hengyang, and Huarong counties in Hunan Province convened meetings of mothers-in-law, youth, women, and male farmers, explaining the Marriage Law in conjunction with real people and real events in the local area, making many men and women aware of the evils of the old marriage system. Huang, an old woman from Yongxingchang Township, Songzi County, personally sent her "child bride" to the Farmers' Association the day after the meeting, and gave her a set of clothing materials and a load of grain, allowing her to return to her mother's home. Huanggang, Xishui, Tianmen and other counties in Hubei, and Lushan, Shangqiu and other counties in Henan, used drum lyrics,快板, cartoons, blackboards and other forms, and carried out Marriage Law propaganda through rural drama troupes, 民校, and winter schools. Women in the Linshan River District of Huanggang County compiled their past experiences of being oppressed by the feudal marriage system into songs and promoted them everywhere, inspiring women to actively fight against the feudal marriage system. Many places have also adopted the method of case-based publicity. Lishan County in Hubei Province and Wugang County in Hunan Province have held trials with thousands of people, and the murderers who killed women were executed on the spot. The persons in charge of the People's Government and the Democratic Women's Federation spoke at the meeting, specifically exposing the evils of the old marriage system, which was of great educational significance to the masses.

    中南各地普遍展开婚姻法的宣传教育
    中南各地普遍展开婚姻法的宣传和教育活动。各地民主妇联、司法部门、法院等负责人，在各种会议上，做了婚姻法的专题报告，并组织干部和各界代表进行学习。湖北、河南大部分县及其它省一部分县的有关干部，并把婚姻法作为当前学习的主要内容之一。湖南省、江西省、武汉市及各省部分专区和县的有关部门，在学习婚姻法以后，都派出检查小组分别到各地巡回检查。
    各地在贯彻执行婚姻法中，运用各种各样的方式进行宣传教育。湖北省武昌县五里界区、沔阳县城关区和江西省信丰县安息区开展婚姻法宣传后，在八、九、十三个月中自由结婚的有三百五十三对。其中有遵照婚姻法的精神，解除了不合理的婚姻关系后再结婚的；有寡妇改嫁的。人民政府干部就运用这些事例，向群众宣传。江西信丰县安息区有五十五对青年男女十月十五日在该区区政府礼堂集体结婚；区政府负责人在当地居民来观礼的时候，宣传婚姻法；新郎、新娘也自动向来观礼的群众说明自己自由恋爱的经过。这种宣传方法收效极大。广西平乐县月盛村有一对曾替地主做了十年牛马的长工和丫头在农会主持下，在该村庆祝减租退押胜利大会上举行婚礼，扩大了婚姻法的影响。湖北省松滋县与湖南益阳、衡阳、华容等县召开了婆婆会、青年会、妇女会和男农民会，结合当地真人真事，讲解婚姻法，使很多男女群众认识到旧婚姻制度的罪恶。松滋县永兴场乡黄老婆婆，在会后第二天，就把他的“童养媳”亲自送到农会，并送她一套衣料，一担谷子，让她回娘家。湖北的黄冈、浠水、天门等县，河南的鲁山、商邱等县，运用鼓词、快板、漫画、黑板报等形式，通过农村剧团、民校、冬学开展婚姻法的宣传工作。黄冈县琳山河区的妇女把自己过去遭受封建婚姻压迫的情形编成歌子到处宣传，启发妇女积极起来向封建婚姻制度斗争。很多地方还采用了就案宣传的方法。湖北省的礼山县、湖南省的武冈县，都曾召开过数千人的审判大会，把杀害妇女的凶手当场执行枪决。人民政府和民主妇联的负责人在会上讲话，具体揭发旧婚姻制度的罪恶，这对群众的教育意义很大。（新华社）
