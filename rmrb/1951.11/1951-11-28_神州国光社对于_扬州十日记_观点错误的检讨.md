Column: Reaction to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

To the Editor:

    The letter from Comrade Guoyi published in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on November 3rd pointed out the erroneous views on historical materials in the preface of "Ten Days of Yangzhou" published by our press. Our press has promptly corrected the unissued copies. We express our deep gratitude to the People's Daily and Comrade Guoyi.

    This series of books consists of sixteen volumes, totaling approximately 2.5 million words. During the reprinting after liberation, a proofreading was conducted, revealing as many as 5,408 errors, demonstrating the frightening extent of negligence in our press's work before liberation. However, in this re-examination, we only focused on the text and punctuation, while relaxing our approach to the stance and viewpoints held in the handling of historical materials. This still indicates that our press is not responsible enough for its publishing work.

    In the future, our press will strengthen its political study and further examine every book we publish.

### 神州国光社对于“扬州十日记”观点错误的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    神州国光社对于“扬州十日记”观点错误的检讨
    编辑同志：十一月三日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊载的国义同志的来信，指出我社出版的“扬州十日记”的序言中对史料看法有错误。我社已及时把尚未发行的部分立即改正。对人民日报和国义同志，表示深切的感谢。
    这部丛书共十六册，约二百五十余万字，解放后再版时曾作校勘，发见错误达五千四百零八处，足见解放前我社的工作疏忽，达到怎样可怕的程度。但在此次重勘中，亦仅注意到文字和标点，而放松了对于史料的处理所抱的立场和观点，这仍表明着我社对出版工作，是不够负责的。
    今后我社当加强政治学习，并进一步检查自己出版的每一本书。　神州国光社
