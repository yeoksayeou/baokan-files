　　British Bourgeois Public Opinion
    Expresses Dissatisfaction with U.S. Delaying Negotiations

    [Xinhua News Agency, London, 22nd] News from London: The U.S. side's behavior in delaying the Korean armistice negotiations has aroused dissatisfaction and anxiety among some of the bourgeois public opinion in Britain, a major accomplice in the aggression against Korea. The London weekly *The Spectator* recently stated in an editorial that after both sides could have reached an agreement, it believed that the U.S. chief negotiator "General Joy and his colleagues seem intent on obstructing this harmony as much as possible." *The Sunday Times* published a dispatch from its Washington correspondent on the 18th, in which the reporter complained: "Since North Korea agreed to a ceasefire along the battle line instead of along the 38th parallel, negotiations are still dragging on, and unfortunately, incidents of atrocities have occurred again (referring to the lies fabricated by the U.S. military about the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army massacring prisoners)." This has caused many people to develop "fears." The London *Times* also argued in a commentary on the 9th that after both sides agreed to delineate the military demarcation line, "what should be done is a ceasefire."

    In the recent British Parliament debates, several Members of Parliament questioned the fact that the Korean armistice negotiations had not yet reached an agreement. On the 14th, several MPs asked the Churchill government to appoint a British representative to participate in the Korean armistice negotiations in order to "speed up the negotiations." They warned that people are "increasingly uneasy" about the delay in the Korean armistice negotiations. On the 16th, MPs Silverman, Hughes, and eleven others proposed a motion in the House of Commons, requesting the government to "promptly take all appropriate steps to ensure an immediate ceasefire in the Korean War on the basis of the ceasefire line already agreed upon by both sides." In the debate on foreign policy on the 19th, Labour MP Donnally said that the British public felt very uneasy about the situation in the Korean armistice negotiations. He demanded that "the British government tell the U.S. government that the Korean War has lasted long enough." Another Labour MP, Mrs. Castle, also expressed dissatisfaction with the U.S.'s delaying tactics in the negotiations, saying that there were many doubts now, believing that "our allies do not want a ceasefire."

　　英国部分资产阶级舆论
    对美国拖延谈判表示不满
    【新华社二十二日讯】伦敦消息：美国方面拖延朝鲜停战谈判的行为，已引起侵朝主要帮凶国家英国的一部分资产阶级舆论的不满和焦虑。伦敦《旁观者》周刊最近在社论中指出双方本来已经可以获致协议以后，认为美方首席谈判代表“乔埃中将与他的同僚们似乎一意尽可能地阻碍这种和谐”。《星期日泰晤士报》十八日发表了该报驻华盛顿记者的电讯，该记者抱怨说：“自从北朝鲜答应沿交战线而不是沿三八线休战后，谈判仍在拖延，同时不幸又发生了关于暴行的事件（按指美国军方捏造的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军屠杀俘虏的谎言）”，这样，就使得许多人发生“疑惧”。伦敦《泰晤士报》也在九日的评论中主张：在双方同意划定军事分界线以后，“应该做的事就是停火”。
    在最近英国议会的辩论中，有若干议员就朝鲜停战谈判迟迟未能获得协议一事提出质询。十四日，有好几个议员要求邱吉尔政府指派英国代表参加朝鲜停战谈判，以“加速谈判的进行”。他们警告说：人们对朝鲜停战谈判的拖延“越来越感到不安”。十六日，议员锡尔佛曼、休士等十一人在下院提出动议，要求政府“迅速采取一切适当的步骤，保证朝鲜战争在双方已经同意的停火线的基础上立即停火”。在十九日关于外交政策的辩论中，工党议员唐纳黎说：英国公众对朝鲜停战谈判的情形，感觉非常不安。他要求“英国政府告诉美国政府：朝鲜战争已经延续得够长了”。另一个工党议员克斯尔夫人也对美国的拖延谈判表示不满，她说：现在各方疑虑丛生，认为“我们的盟国并不要停火”。
