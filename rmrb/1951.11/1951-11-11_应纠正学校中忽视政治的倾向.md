    Correct the Tendency to Neglect Politics in Schools
   To the Editor: Since the beginning of formal study at our Jinan First Middle School in Shandong Province, some students have shown a tendency to neglect politics. Some students feel that the land reform has been completed and that good days have already been achieved, thus generating a "warm food and clothing mentality." They believe that this new democratic society is already very good and that there is no need to advance towards a socialist and communist society. This kind of thinking is even more serious among older students. Some students are not concerned about current affairs. They believe that since the Chinese People's Volunteers are resisting American imperialism in Korea, our national defense is secure, and the government is responsible for designing and carrying out all construction work. Therefore, they are too lazy to even read the newspaper. Some students cram books, mechanically memorizing questions and answers, with the goal of preparing for exams and striving to pass. In addition, some students are not enthusiastic about patriotic donations, and the patriotic covenants they make are merely formalities.
   Although these tendencies to neglect politics have now attracted the attention of our school and necessary corrections have been made, I believe that they may also exist in other regions. Therefore, I hope that the cultural and educational departments in various regions will pay attention to this issue. Zhen Yuan

### 应纠正学校中忽视政治的倾向

    应纠正学校中忽视政治的倾向
   编辑同志：我们山东省济宁第一中学从开始正规学习以后，在一部分学生中间曾发生了忽视政治的倾向。有的学生觉得土地改革已经完成，好日子业已得到，因而产生“温饱思想”。他们认为这个新民主主义社会就很不错，不必再向社会主义及共产主义社会前进了。年龄较大的学生们，这种思想更严重些。有些学生则对于时事不关心。他们认为有人民志愿军在朝鲜抵抗着美帝国主义，我们的国防已高枕无忧，一切建设工作自有政府负责设计进行。因此，他们对报纸也懒得看了。有的学生死啃书本，硬记问答题，其目的是准备考试，争取及格。另外，有些学生对于爱国捐献不热烈，订的爱国公约流于形式。
   这些忽视政治的倾向，虽然现在已引起我们学校的重视，并作了必要的纠正，但我认为在其他地区也可能存在。因此，我希望各地文教部门都来重视这个问题。　振　元
