    We Love Works Like "Sketches of the Capital"
    Editor: The "People's Weekly" issue number 21 published a painting by Comrade Shao Yu entitled "Going to Tiananmen to See Chairman Mao" and a poem explaining its content on the cover. Although I don't understand painting, I developed a great interest and love for this painting. I asked other comrades for their opinions, and they all said in unison: "We love such works." We believe that such works are simple and moving, and they have strong political significance. The form of expression in the painting is also popular. The poem in the painting reads: "If we didn't live in the countryside, we would come to see you every day!" This not only expresses the thoughts of the emancipated farmers in the suburbs of Beijing, but also expresses the thoughts of the emancipated farmers all over the country.
    We love the works of Comrade Shao Yu (including those published in the People's Daily), and we warmly hope that the people's own newspapers and periodicals can publish such educational works, and we hope that artists will create more and better works for us.

### 我们热爱“首都速写”这样的作品

    我们热爱“首都速写”这样的作品
    编辑同志：“人民周报”第二十一期封面上刊登了邵宇同志题名为“到天安门看毛主席”的一幅画和说明内容的一首诗。虽然我不懂得画，但是我对这幅画发生了极大的兴趣和热爱。我征求其他同志的意见，也都异口同声地说：“我们爱这样的作品。”我们认为这样的作品是朴素而动人的，它具有强烈的政治意义。画的表现形式也是通俗的。画中的那首诗这样写着：“要不是住在乡下，我们天天来看你！”这不仅说出北京市郊翻身农民心里的话，而且是把全国各地翻身农民心里的话都说出来了。
    我们热爱邵宇同志的作品（包括在人民日报所发表的），我们热烈希望人民自己的报纸、刊物能够发表这样有教育意义的作品，我们更希望美术工作者为我们创作更多更好的作品出来。
