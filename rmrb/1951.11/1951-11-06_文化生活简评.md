　　Cultural Life Brief Commentary
    Should Eliminate Comic Books Propagating Imperialist Thought

    According to reports from readers Shi Lie in Changsha City and Su Wen, a reader of the Western Sichuan Daily on September 13th, some bookstores in Guangzhou are transporting a large number of comic books to the interior that propagate imperialist war cries and are grotesque and obscene. Among them are titles such as "Flying Tigers," "Great War Against the Atomic Party," "Bloody Battle in the Bewildering Maze," and "Land of Beautiful Women," etc. Apart from a portion of these comic books being published by Guangzhou Lianyi Publishing House and Taisheng Bookstore, the majority come from Hong Kong and other places. This is clearly a planned reactionary propaganda effort by the imperialists and Kuomintang reactionaries. Local book distribution agencies should pay close attention to this. Comic book vendors in Changsha City have already held a meeting to guarantee they will not buy harmful comic books and have incorporated this into a patriotic pact. This kind of mass movement is entirely proper.

    应肃清宣传帝国主义思想的连环图画
    根据本报长沙市读者史烈及九月十三日川西日报读者苏文等反映，广州某些书店大量向内地运销宣传帝国主义战争叫嚣与怪诞、淫秽的连环画。其中有什么《飞虎队》、《大战原子党》、《血战迷魂阵》、《美女国》等等。这些连环图画除一部分是广州联益出版社和泰生书局出版的外，大多数来自香港等地。这显然是帝国主义和国民党反动派有计划进行的反动宣传。各地图书发行机关应该对此加以密切注意。长沙市连环图画摊贩，已召开大会保证不买有害的连环图画，并将此订入爱国公约，这种群众性的运动是十分正当的。
