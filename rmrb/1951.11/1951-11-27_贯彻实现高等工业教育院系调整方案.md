    Implement the Plan for Adjusting Departments of Higher Industrial Education

    Recently, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government convened a National Conference of Presidents of Institutes of Technology, formulating the 1952 National Plan for Adjusting Departments of Higher Industrial Education. This is a major event in reforming higher education.

    Currently, our higher industrial education is not yet able to meet the needs of national construction. To put industrial education on the path of planned development and more effectively cultivate talent for national construction, it is necessary to change the current state of faculty and equipment in higher industrial education, and to rationally use existing human and material resources to maximize their effectiveness, according to the needs of national construction. At the same time, in the next five to ten years, we must adopt a policy of combining long-term cultivation with short-term training, focusing on the development of industrial specialized courses and short-term training classes.

    In the work of adjusting departments, some specific issues, such as housing, equipment, and funding, must of course be resolved as much as possible, but at present, we must use revolutionary spirit and revolutionary methods to solve them. We must strive for frugality and oppose extravagance and waste.

    To do a good job in adjusting departments, leading cadres of various colleges and universities must first unify their thinking, rely on the masses, promote democratic spirit, and use everyone's strength to overcome difficulties. In this regard, Tianjin University and Dalian Institute of Technology have gained experience. Tianjin University was formed in September of this year by the merger of Peiyang University and Hebei Institute of Technology. During the merger, some disputes arose between the two schools, but after repeated consultations and relying on the strength of the masses, various issues were finally resolved. At the National Conference of Presidents of Institutes of Technology, although many presidents of colleges of technology in principle agreed to the adjustment plan, they also had many different ideas on certain specific issues. For example, some teachers always hope that their colleges and departments can increase in the adjustment; other teachers are afraid that they will not get along with teachers from other colleges after the merger. Everyone felt a "headache" about the relocation issue after the adjustment. For example, some teachers were thinking: What about the house after the relocation? Will we move into the city or into the countryside? Is the air good? These considerations were entirely from the perspective of personal or unit interests. These ideological problems should be resolved in this teacher training. We must closely combine the work of adjusting departments with the ideological transformation of teachers, and implement this adjustment plan.

### 贯彻实现高等工业教育院系调整方案

    贯彻实现高等工业教育院系调整方案
    最近中央人民政府教育部召开了全国工学院院长会议，拟定了一九五二年全国高等工业教育的院系调整方案。这是改革高等教育工作中的一件大事。
    目前我们的高等工业教育还不能适应国家建设的需要。为使工业教育走向有计划的发展的道路，更有效地培养国家建设人才，必须根据国家建设的需要，改变目前高等工业教育中师资和设备的情况，合理地使用现有的人力、物力，使它发挥最大的效用。同时，在今后五年到十年中，必须采取长期培养与短期训练相结合的方针，着重发展工业专修科与短期训练班。
    在院系调整工作中，对某些具体问题，如房屋、设备、经费等问题，当然必须尽量设法解决，但在目前，我们必须用革命的精神和革命的办法来解决。我们必须力求节约，反对铺张浪费。
    要搞好院系调整工作，各院校领导干部必须首先打通思想，依靠群众，发扬民主精神，用大家的力量来克服困难。在这方面，天津大学和大连工学院都取得了经验。天津大学是在今年九月由北洋大学与河北工学院合并成立的。在合并时两校曾发生某些争执，但是经过再三磋商，并依靠群众力量，各项问题终于获得了解决。在全国工学院院长会议上，许多高等学校工学院院长在原则上虽然同意调整的方案，但在某些具体问题上也有许多不同的打算。如有的教师总希望在调整中自己的院校系科能增多；有的教师则怕合并后与其他院校的教师相处不来。对调整后的搬家问题大家都感到“头痛”，如有的教师心里想着：搬家后的房子怎么样？是搬进城里去呢，还是搬到乡下去？空气好不好？这些完全是从个人或本单位的利益来考虑的。这些思想问题都应该在这次教师学习中加以解决，我们必须将院系调整工作和教师们的思想改造密切地结合起来，贯彻实现这个调整方案。
