Nurseries for Teachers and Staff in Shenyang

The nurseries for teachers and staff in Shenyang began to be established in September 1950. Now, they have developed to 41 locations, with a total of 68 nursery workers. They accommodate 286 infants and young children under the age of six, solving the difficulty of 250 female teachers bringing their children to work and improving their work efficiency.

Before the establishment of the nurseries, female teachers with children had to run home to breastfeed every day. Those who lived far away spent a lot of time and transportation costs. Some mothers who couldn't afford nannies had to leave their children with neighbors or lock them at home. As a result, the children often couldn't be fed on time, and their development was affected.

Thus, female teachers with children were not at ease at work because of their children. They were often distracted in class and during study sessions because they were thinking about their children, and they took a lot of leave and absences. For example, in the past, two female teachers at Nanchang Elementary School would take leave every day, and some female teachers even requested to resign because of their children. As for participating in political and recreational activities, it was out of the question.

In order to overcome this difficulty, efforts were made to establish nurseries. The first difficulty encountered was the lack of housing, as the houses in Shenyang's schools were originally insufficient. However, this difficulty was overcome under the active leadership of the school authorities and the efforts of the teachers and staff. Some school principals vacated their own houses as nurseries, while others borrowed the female teachers' dormitories during the day to use as nurseries, returning them to them as dormitories in the evening. In terms of equipment, due to the school's limited funding, they had to make the most of the existing equipment and work together to decorate in order to save expenses. The main expenses were equipment costs and the nursery workers' salaries. The equipment costs were borne by the school, while the Bureau of Culture and Education subsidized each nursery worker with 50 work points per month (in September of this year, one work point was equivalent to about 1,900 yuan), and the rest was borne by the mothers (a nursery worker's monthly salary ranged from 90 to 110 work points). The school also subsidized a portion where possible. In this way, each mother only paid about eight work points of childcare fees per month.

Last September, Shenyang's first nursery for teachers and staff – the Nanchang Elementary School Nursery – was established. But how to expand, consolidate, and improve it? The method was: the Democratic Women's Federation constantly helped them improve their professional skills, improve hygiene, establish systems, and the Bureau of Culture and Education introduced their typical experiences to various schools. It also carried out vigorous publicity through newspapers, radio, and meetings, arousing the attention of various schools to the establishment of nurseries. At the same time, female teachers also universally put forward this request. In this way, nurseries for teachers and staff developed. Last year, there were only eight nurseries in the city, with 42 infants and young children; this summer, it has increased to 40 nurseries, with 286 infants and young children.

With the establishment of nurseries, female teachers with children were more at ease at work, their work efficiency improved, and the absenteeism rate also decreased. Taking Nanchang Elementary School as an example, no teachers took leave due to child issues, and there were no more requests to resign due to child issues. Some female teachers with children were even rated as model teachers. The economic burden on mothers has also been reduced. In the past, mothers had to spend about 100 work points per month to hire nannies and buy milk powder, but now it only costs eight work points.

At the same time, their political and professional learning was strengthened. They spoke more actively at study and discussion sessions. Some female teachers not only actively participated in school studies but also went outside the school to participate in night university studies.

They were also able to participate in social activities. For example, they all actively participated in the "May Day" parade this year. This improved their political thinking. Teacher Sun Xiujie said: "During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, who cared about your children? If you had children, you were unlucky. Now, the People's Government has helped us solve the difficulty of bringing children to work, and I must do my job well in the future!" In the past, mothers rarely went to movies or plays, but now they can participate in various cultural and recreational activities like other teachers.

In addition, because children can be fed and sleep on time, the infants and young children are getting stronger and healthier day by day. For example, the weight of infants at Nanchang Elementary School increased by an average of one jin per month.

Based on Shenyang's experience, how can we do a good job in childcare?

First, we must run nurseries with a revolutionary spirit. Now, female teachers with children urgently need nurseries to solve the problem of bringing their children to work. We cannot wait until we have the conditions to establish a complete and scientific nursery before discussing this issue. We should establish small nurseries based on existing material and human resources and then gradually improve them.

Second, childcare work is still in its initial stage, and there are very few experienced childcare workers. Therefore, we can only ask some adult women from families to take on this work. However, it should be noted that nursery workers should preferably be women who have given birth to children, because they are generally more at ease at work, know how to take care of children, and are patient.

Third, when nurseries are first established, mothers are not at ease and always want to see their children. They often go to the nursery, and some mothers buy snacks for their children. This adds a lot of trouble to the nursery workers and affects the children's normal life. Therefore, nurseries must establish strict rules and require mothers to see their children at specified times. In this way, children can have a regular eating and sleeping schedule.

Fourth, we must strengthen the political education of nursery workers. Most of the nursery workers in teachers' and staff nurseries are housewives who lack childcare knowledge. In the beginning, because mothers do not follow the rules and the children cry, they will feel uneasy and not want to continue working. However, as long as we can make them politically aware of the importance of childcare work now, their work enthusiasm will stabilize.

### 沈阳市的教职员哺乳室

    沈阳市的教职员哺乳室
    沈阳市教职员哺乳室是一九五○年九月间开始建立的，现在已发展到四十一处，保育员共有六十八名，收容六岁以下的乳幼儿共二百八十六名，解决了二百五十名女教员带孩子的困难，提高了她们的工作效率。
    教职员托儿所成立以前，有孩子的女教员，每天都要跑回家去喂奶。离家远的，花了不少的时间和车费；而有些雇不起褓姆的母亲，只好把孩子寄放到邻家，或把孩子锁在家里；因此，孩子往往不能适时吃奶，发育受到了影响。
    这样，有孩子的女教员，因为孩子的牵累，工作很不安心。她们在上课时、学习时，因为惦念孩子，精神不集中，请假和缺勤的很多。如南昌完全小学过去每天都有两个女教师请假，还有些女教师因为孩子问题要求辞职；至于参加政治活动和文娱活动，更是谈不到了。
    为了克服这个困难，就设法建立哺乳室。首先碰到的是房子缺乏的困难，因为沈阳各学校的房子本来就是不够的；但在校方积极领导和教职员的努力下，克服了这个困难。有的学校的校长腾出自己的房子作哺乳室，有的学校白天借女教员的宿舍做哺乳室，晚间仍归还她们做宿舍，这样房子问题算解决了。在设备上，因为学校经费少，只好尽量利用现有的器材，大家一起动手来布置，以节省开支。经费开支主要是设备费和保育员的薪金。设备费由学校负责，至于保育员的薪金，则由文教局每月给每个保育员补助五十工分（今年九月一工分约合一千九百元），其余由母亲负担（一个保育员每月薪金九十分到一百一十分不等），在可能条件下校方也补助一部分。这样，每个母亲每月大约只出八工分的托儿费。
    去年九月沈阳第一个教职员哺乳室——南昌完全小学哺乳室建立了。但是怎样去扩大、巩固与提高呢？办法是：民主妇女联合会不断地帮助她们改进业务，搞好卫生工作，建立制度，并由文教局把她们的典型经验介绍到各个学校去，又通过报纸、广播和会议等大力进行宣传，引起了各个学校对建立哺乳室的重视，同时女教员也普遍提出了这个要求。这样，教职员哺乳室发展起来了。去年全市只有哺乳室八所，乳幼儿四十二人；今年夏季已增加到哺乳室四十所，乳幼儿二百八十六人。
    设立了哺乳室，有孩子的女教师工作比较安心了，工作效率提高了，缺勤率也减低了。就以南昌完全小学来说，再没有教师因孩子问题而请假，也没有因小孩问题要求辞职的现象了。有些有孩子的女教员并被评为模范教师。母亲们的经济负担也减轻了，过去母亲雇褓姆、买奶粉每月总得一百工分左右，现在只需八工分就够了。
    同时，加强了她们的政治和业务学习。她们在学习讨论会上，发言积极了；有些女教师不但积极参加校内学习，而且到校外参加夜大学学习。
    她们也能够参加社会活动了，如今年“五一”节大游行时她们就都曾积极参加。这样就提高了她们的政治思想。教员孙秀杰说：“国民党反动派统治时期谁管你的孩子，有孩子你自己倒霉。现在人民政府帮助我们解决了带孩子的困难，我今后一定要把工作做好！”过去，看电影、看戏，做妈妈的是难得去的，现在她们都能像其他教员一样参加各种文化娱乐活动。
    此外，由于孩子能按时吃奶，按时睡眠，乳幼儿的身体一天比一天健壮了。例如南昌完全小学婴孩的体重平均每月增加一斤。
    根据沈阳的经验，怎样才能办好保育工作呢？
    首先要以革命精神来办哺乳室。现在有孩子的女教师正迫切需要托儿所来解决她们带孩子的问题，我们不能等待有条件成立一个完备的科学化的哺乳室以后才来谈这个问题，应该根据现有的物质及人力条件成立小型哺乳室，然后再逐步加以改善。
    第二，现在保育工作还处在初级阶段，有经验的保育工作人员是很少的；因此只好请一些家庭成年妇女来担任这件工作。但应该注意，保育员最好是生过孩子的，因为她们大都能比较安心地工作，带孩子有办法，而且耐心。
    第三，哺乳室开始建立时，妈妈们不放心，老想看孩子，常去哺乳室，有的妈妈买零食给孩子吃。这样给保育员增加了许多麻烦，而且影响了孩子的正常生活；因此哺乳室必须定出严格的制度，要她们在规定时间内来看小孩。这样孩子们吃乳、睡眠才可以有规律。
    第四，要加强保育员的政治教育。教职员托儿所的保育员多是家庭妇女，没有保育知识，在开始时，因妈妈们不执行制度，孩子又哭，她们是会发生不安心的现象的，不想再干下去；但是只要我们能使她们从政治上认识现在保育工作的重要性，她们的工作情绪是会安定下来的。
