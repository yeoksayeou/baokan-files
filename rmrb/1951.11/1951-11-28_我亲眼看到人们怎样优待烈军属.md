    Do a Good Job in Supporting the Army and Giving Preferential Treatment to Families of Revolutionary Martyrs

    I Personally Witnessed How People Treat the Families of Revolutionary Martyrs with Preference

    I participated in the old revolutionary base area visiting group and went to eight villages in the fifth district of Qingdao to express sympathy and solicitude for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and to understand their living conditions. This made me deeply feel how lovable the new countryside is after the land reform.

    When we arrived at Xinxing Village in that district, due to continuous rainy days, all the fields were flooded. The corn and sorghum, which were about to ripen, were swaying from side to side in the water. Many villagers, men and women, and even children of eight or nine years old, were busy digging drainage channels. Everyone was soaked, but they were still working happily. We found the village chief in the crowd, his whole body covered in mud. After he understood our intention, he pointed to the ground and said, "You see, Chairman Mao cares so much about the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers!" It turned out that they were draining water from the land of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. The village chief also told us, "The people's awareness has been greatly improved. To work for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, there is no need to assign or supervise, everyone automatically rushes to do it. That enthusiasm is like celebrating a happy event." A comrade asked the village chief, "What about the water in their own fields? Is it that the land allocated to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers is all in the low-lying areas to the west?" The village chief smiled and said, "No, we always allocate the closest land to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. Everyone's fields are equally flooded, but everyone always rushes to drain the water, so that the land of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers who lack labor power does not suffer losses." Then he said, "If we work hard for another day today, the land of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers can be completely rescued, and tomorrow we can work on our own land."

    The two villages of Dongkou and Xikou are both near the sea, and the vast majority of residents are fishermen. They have stipulated that when the fishing season comes, if the fishermen go out to sea, the land of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers will be cultivated by other women and old people who cannot go out to sea. If the yield cannot reach 152 to 212 catties of grain per mu (the local general yield), everyone will extract a part of the income from fishing to make up for it.

    We visited eight villages and expressed sympathy and solicitude for more than 200 families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. Their lives are generally very good. For some who lacked clothes, the government had already bought several bolts of high-quality cloth in February and March to solve their problems. At a symposium in Dongkou Village, the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers all scrambled to say, "Our lives are even better than when our sons were at home. During festivals, everyone sends us this and that. The local people also look up to us. Whenever there is something, or a meeting is held, they invite us. The cadres also often come to talk and express sympathy and solicitude, which is even more lively than when our sons were at home." An old woman, a family member of a soldier, gestured and described how the women's association leaders quietly filled her water tank before dawn. Another old woman told us that during the land reform review, everyone voluntarily exchanged her land twelve miles away for land near her door.

    When we were leaving, the representatives of the families of soldiers kept urging us, "Please tell them that everything is fine at home, so don't worry. We only hope that they will strive to perform meritorious service in order to repay the care of the People's Government and the people for us."

### 我亲眼看到人们怎样优待烈军属

专栏：做好拥军优属工作

    我亲眼看到人们怎样优待烈军属
    我参加了老根据地访问团，到青岛第五区的八个村庄慰问烈、军属，并对他们的生活情况作了了解，使我深深感到土地改革后的新农村是多么可爱。
    当我们到该区新兴村时，由于连天的阴雨，所有的田地里都灌满了水。眼看快要熟的玉米、高粱，已被水淹得东摇西摆。许多老乡，男男女女，还有八、九岁的小娃娃，都在那里忙着开疏水道。大家混身都湿透了，但仍在愉快地忙碌着。我们在人堆中找到了村长，他满身满脸都是泥浆。他明白了我们的来意后，用手指着地里说：“你们看，毛主席是多么关心烈、军属！”原来他们正在给烈、军属们的地排水。村长又告诉我们：“人民的觉悟是大大提高了。为烈、军属干活，不要指派、督促，就自动地抢着干了。那股劲头就像办喜事一样。”一位同志又问村长：“他们自己地里的水怎样呢？是不是烈、军属分到的地都在西头低地上？”村长微笑着说：“不，总是分近地给烈、军属们的。大家的地里同样被水淹着，但是大家总是抢着来弄，不让没有劳动力的烈、军属的地受损失。”接着他又说：“今天再突击一天，烈、军属的地就可以全部救出，明天就能去搞自己的地了。”
    东口和西口两个村庄都靠海边，居民绝大多数是渔民。他们曾自己规定渔汛来时，如打渔的下海去了，烈、军属的地就交给其他不能下海的妇女、老人们代为耕种。如果产量不能达到每亩一百五十二斤至二百一十二斤粮食（当地一般产量）时，大家就从打渔的收入中抽出一部来补足。
    我们跑了八个村庄，慰问了二百多户烈、军属。他们的生活一般都过得很好。有些缺少衣服的，政府早在二、三月里就买了几匹龙头细布解决了他们的问题。在东口村的一个座谈会上，烈、军属们都争着说：“俺们的生活比儿子在家时还好。逢年过节，大伙给俺送这送那。地方上也都看得起俺，一有什么事，或开个什么会，都要请上俺们。干部也时常来说话，慰问，比儿子在家时还热闹。”一位军属老大娘比手划脚地叙说妇女会领导妇女如何在天还没亮时就悄悄地把她的水缸挑满了水。又一位老大娘告诉我们说，在土地改革复查时，大家自动地把她在十二里外的地换成了门前的近地。
    我们临走时，军属代表不断地嘱咐我们：“请告诉他们，家里很好，不用挂念。只希望他们争取立功，好报答人民政府和人民对我们的照顾。”
