　　Cadres in Old Soviet Areas of Changshu County Examine and Rectify "Li Sixi Thought"
　　The old Soviet area of Changshu County convened an enlarged meeting of township and village cadres on the 20th of last month to mobilize everyone to examine their own "Li Sixi Thought." Feng Lilang, director of the Farmers' Association of Tuanjie Village, Xin Su Township, said: "After the land reform, I wholeheartedly wanted to engage in production. I have been working for a considerable time, and it's time to change 'shifts'." Chen Yongsheng of Mulu Township said: "In the past, I thought that being a cadre meant being annoyed by everyone, and I always wanted to go home to produce. When I saw that my crops were not growing as well as others', I didn't want to work." Zhou Xiaoquan, militia platoon leader of Donghu Township, and Xu Hesheng, militia company commander of Xin Hu Township, said: "If we don't work hard, American imperialism, landlords, and counter-revolutionaries will seize the opportunity to attack, the fruits of victory will not be preserved, and good days will not last long. To protect good days, we must rely on ourselves." After exposing and criticizing their "Li Sixi Thought," everyone expressed their determination to carry the revolution through to the end. Based on this thought, cadres in each township have also formulated future work plans.

　　常熟县古苏区乡、村干部检查纠正“李四喜思想”
    常熟县古苏区在上月二十日召开了乡、村干部扩大会议，发动大家检查自己的“李四喜思想”。新苏乡团结村农民协会主任冯理良说：“土地改革后我就一心一意想搞生产，作工作时间不短了，该换换‘班’了。”木陆乡陈永生说：“过去我认为作干部几头受气，老想回家生产，看到自己的庄稼长得不如人，就不想工作了。”东湖乡民兵分队长周小全，新湖乡民兵中队长徐和生等说：“如果我们不好好工作，美帝国主义、地主、反革命分子就会钻空子进攻，胜利果实就保不住，好日子就过不长。要保护好日子就得靠自己。”大家在揭发批判了自己的“李四喜思想”后，纷纷表示一定要革命到底。各乡干部又在这一思想基础上，制定了今后的工作计划。        刘立荣　吴恩霖
