　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 11th: Vienna dispatch: Tomizawa Hiroshi, the Japanese representative attending the Second Session of the World Peace Council, stated to a reporter from this agency: The resolution on the Japan issue passed by this session of the World Peace Council will further advance the peace movement in Japan. The Japanese people will certainly not disappoint the hopes of the world's peace-loving people, and are determined to expand and strengthen the movement against rearmament and to demand that the five major powers conclude a peace pact. Tomizawa Hiroshi said: Since the signing of the San Francisco Separate Peace Treaty and the US-Japan "Security Treaty," the struggle of the Japanese people against the Separate Peace Treaty and the US-Japan "Security Treaty" has significantly expanded. The nation's largest labor union—the National Railway Workers' Union, the Teachers' Union, and the metal, printing, postal and telecommunications unions—have all risen up to oppose these two treaties. Workers are brewing strikes; teachers are explaining to students that the San Francisco "Treaty" will lead to the ruin of Japan; mass rallies held in various places have increased compared to before. The vast majority of the Japanese people know that a separate peace is a path to destruction. Tomizawa Hiroshi finally said: The Korean War has further worsened the lives of the Japanese people. The Japanese people hold the Chinese people's aid to the Korean people in high esteem. The Japanese people have a deep experience of the pain of war and clearly know who is delaying the Korean armistice negotiations. The Japanese people are fighting to stop the war.

    拥护关于日本问题的决议 【新华社布拉格十一日电】维也纳消息：出席世界和平理事会第二届会议的日本代表富泽宏，对本社记者发表谈话说：本届世界和平理事会通过的关于日本问题的决议，将进一步推进日本的和平运动。日本人民一定不辜负世界爱好和平人民的希望，要决心扩大并加强反对重新武装和开展要求五大国缔结和平公约的运动。富泽宏说：旧金山单独对日和约和美日“安全条约”签订以后，日本人民反对单独对日和约和美日“安全条约”的斗争有显著的扩大。全国最大的工会——国营铁道工人工会、教职员工会以及金属、印刷、邮电等工会，都起来反对这两项条约。工人在酝酿罢工；教员在给学生解释旧金山“和约”将要灭亡日本；各地举行的群众大会，比以前增加了。绝大多数的日本人民都知道单独媾和是灭亡的道路。富泽宏最后说：朝鲜战争使日本人民生活更加恶化。日本人民对于中国人民对朝鲜人民的援助，怀有高度的敬意。日本人民对战争的痛苦体验很深，并且清楚地知道谁在拖延朝鲜停战谈判。日本人民正在为制止战争而斗争。
