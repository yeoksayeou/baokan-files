Changping County People's Court, Why Doesn't it Act According to the Marriage Law?
	Ren Shuzhen
	I am Ren Shuzhen, from Mengzu Village, Fourth District, Changping County, Hebei Province. I filed for divorce a long time ago, but the County People's Court has not dealt with it. I have written the details below.
	Six years ago, my parents arranged my engagement to Liu Chunxi from the same village. I objected several times, but my parents, aunts, and grandmother all refused, saying, "It would be so shameful to break off the engagement; that's not something our family does." They forced me to marry him on January 11th of this year. I stayed in Liu's house for four nights and five days, and neither Liu Chunxi nor I paid any attention to each other. I asked the village cadres for a divorce, and they mediated once. Later, I still wanted a divorce, and the village government introduced me to the district, and the district introduced me to the county. On March 13th, I went to the County People's Court. The first time, a comrade surnamed Li at the County People's Court said, "You can't get a divorce right after getting married; you can go now!" On March 18th, I went to the court again to request a divorce. A female comrade surnamed Ren said, "Go back first, and we'll investigate and then resolve it for you." On March 25th, I went to the court again. The same Comrade Li saw me and said, "You just got married; your issue will be resolved after we study it." In early May, I went to the court again. The female comrade surnamed Ren still said, "We'll study it and then decide." I was so anxious that I couldn't eat, and I became ill. On July 18th, I went to the court for the fifth time. This time, the president of the court, surnamed Ren, received me. He said, "You can get a divorce," but he wanted me to "file a case and put my fingerprint on it." I didn't even know what filing a case meant. This time, I was still not approved for a divorce and was told to go home again. The People's Court is supposed to serve the people. Why won't they resolve my problem! On August 28th, I went to the court for the sixth time. A tall comrade surnamed Liu interrogated me. He immediately said, "You're here again!" I said, "I'm here again. If the court doesn't solve the problem, what else can I do!" Comrade Liu said, "Go back first and wait for a summons. The man and woman should come together to resolve it." On October 28th, I saw President Ren and the female comrade surnamed Ren on the street in Changping County. I asked them to resolve my divorce issue, but they only said, "We can't resolve it if you come alone." On October 29th, I received a summons from the court. The man and I went to the court together. But the female comrade surnamed Ren said, "Go back first. This problem can't be solved. Don't come again and again. We'll send the divorce certificate to you when it's processed."
	It has been more than seven months since I filed for divorce with the County People's Court, and I have been to the court seven times. The comrades of the District Government have also contacted the County Court four or five times, but it has had no effect. The comrades of the County Women's Federation and the County Youth League Committee have also contacted the court, but they have not been effective either. Now, my illness has not yet recovered, and I cannot eat. I urgently await the County Court's approval of my divorce. Why doesn't the Changping County People's Court enforce the Marriage Law? Why do they keep dragging this on? They should examine this bureaucratic style and examine why they don't act according to the law.

    昌平县人民法院为什么不按婚姻法办事？
    任淑珍
    我是河北省昌平县四区孟祖村人，叫任淑珍。我很早就提出离婚，可是县人民法院一直不处理。我把详细情况写在下面。
    六年前，由父母包办，我与本村的刘春喜订了婚。我几次提出反对的意见，可是父、母、姑、姥姥都不答应，她们说：“退婚多么可耻，那不是咱家办的事。”就在今年一月十一日强迫我结了婚。我在刘家住了四夜五天，和刘春喜谁也没理谁。我向村干部要求离婚，他们给调解了一次。后来我还是要离婚，村政府给介绍到区，区介绍到县，三月十三日我到了县人民法院。第一次，县人民法院一位姓李的同志说：“新结婚不可离婚，你走吧！”三月十八日我又到法院要求离婚。一位姓任的女同志说：“你先回去，等我们调查调查再给你解决。”三月二十五日我又去法院，原先那位李同志一见我就说：“你新结婚，你的问题等我们研究研究再解决。”五月初，我又去法院一趟，那位姓任的女同志还是说“研究研究再说”。我急得饭也吃不下去，竟闹起病来了。七月十八日，我第五次去了法院。这次是姓任的院长接见了我。他说“可以离婚”，可是要叫我“立案，按手印”。我也不知道立案是什么。这次还是没批准我离婚，又叫我回家了。人民法院是给人民办事的，怎么老不给解决问题！八月二十八日，我第六趟到了法院，一位大高个姓刘的同志审问我。他一开口就说：“你又来了！”我说：“我又来了。法院不给解决问题，我不来怎么办！”刘同志说：“你先回去，等发出传票，男女两人一块来解决。”十月二十八日我在昌平县城里街上看见了任院长和那个姓任的女同志，我要求他们给我解决离婚问题，他们只说：“你一人来不能解决。”十月二十九日我接到法院的传票，男方与我一齐到了法院。谁知那位姓任的女同志说：“你们先回去，这问题不能解决，你们别一趟一趟来了。等处理好了把离婚证给你寄去。”
    从我向县人民法院提出离婚到现在已经七个多月了，我到法院去了七趟。区政府的同志们也与县法院联系过四、五次，但没发生效力。县妇联、县青年团委员会的工作同志也都和法院联系过，也都没起作用。现在我的病还没好，饭也吃不下去。我迫切等待县法院批准我离婚。昌平县人民法院为什么不执行婚姻法？为什么这样一拖再拖？他们应当检讨这种官僚主义作风，应当检查为什么不按法律办事。
