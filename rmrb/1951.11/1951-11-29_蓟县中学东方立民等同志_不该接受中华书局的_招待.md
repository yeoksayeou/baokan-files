    Comrade Dongfang Limin and Others from Jixian Middle School
    Should Not Accept the "Hospitality" of Zhonghua Book Company

    Editor's Note: The problem reflected by Comrade Cheng Xu is worthy of attention. Comrade Dongfang Limin and others accepting the "hospitality" of Zhonghua Book Company is clearly a form of bribery. The impact of this is extremely negative. Leadership organs in various regions should pay attention to educating cadres in order to prevent or stop similar incidents. Comrade Dongfang Limin has already made a self-criticism regarding accepting the "hospitality," which is published below.

    Comrade Editor:
    Last autumn, I went to the Zhonghua Book Company in Beijing to audit accounts as part of my work. I discovered that the expenses incurred by the company for entertaining purchasing personnel from schools and organizations in other provinces and cities were quite substantial. For example, from January to April 14th of last year, Comrade Dongfang Limin from Jixian Middle School in Tongxian Special District, Hebei Province, was entertained by the company seventeen times (including meals, extra dishes, watching plays, and taking baths), costing a total of 551,600 yuan. Director Li (name unknown) of Xinxiang Normal School and others had extra dishes three times, costing a total of 200,170 yuan. At the time, I thought: Purchasing personnel from other provinces and cities should have funds for food and lodging. Why would they accept the hospitality of the book company? I believe this is a form of bribery. After much consideration, I decided to raise this issue in order to attract the attention of relevant departments.

    蓟县中学东方立民等同志
    不该接受中华书局的“招待”
    编者按：程序同志反映的问题很值得注意。东方立民等同志接受中华书局的“招待”，显然是一种受贿行为。这一影响是十分恶劣的。各地领导机关应注意教育干部，以制止或预防类此情事。东方立民同志对接受“招待”一事已作了检讨，一并发表于后。编辑同志：去年秋天，我因工作到北京中华书局查账，发现该局招待外埠学校、机关采购人员的支出费用是相当大的。如去年一月至四月十四日为止，河北省通县专区蓟县中学的东方立民同志就受该局招待（包括吃饭，加菜，看戏，洗澡等）十七次，共费款五十五万一千六百元。新乡师范李主任（名字不详）等吃饭加菜三次，共费款二十万零一千七百元。当时我想：外埠来北京的采购人员，不会没有食宿费，为什么要受书局的招待呢？我认为这是一种受贿的行为。我考虑再三，才决定把这个问题提出来，以便引起有关部门的注意。
