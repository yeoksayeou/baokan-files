Learning the Great Patriotic Spirit of Soviet Heroes
A Letter to Comrade A. Maresyev, the Soviet "Legless Flying General"
By Chen Zhihan, Combat Hero of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

Dear Comrade A. Maresyev:

On the occasion of the 34th anniversary of the great victory of the Soviet October Revolution, allow me to first extend to you a fighting salute!

Dear Comrade Maresyev: Although we have never met or spoken, you have made a profound impression on me. I have seen your heroic deeds in the Great Patriotic War in magazines and movies. When I saw the movie depicting your combat life, I was very happy and moved to tears. For the sake of the motherland and the people, you bravely piloted your plane to fight the German bandits. Finally, when the gasoline ran out, you jumped from the plane and crawled for eighteen days and nights in that desolate and snowy mountain area, overcoming all kinds of dangers and difficulties, and finally returned to your own ranks, resulting in the loss of both your legs due to frostbite. However, this did not weaken your fighting will in the slightest. Not only were you not pessimistic or disappointed, nor did you rest on your laurels, but you used your extremely tenacious will and perseverance to learn the skill of using prosthetic legs, achieving your desire to continue piloting fighter planes and continue fighting. When we saw you return to the front lines in the movie and shoot down eleven German aircraft, how excited we were! Respected comrade, you have been awarded the glorious title of Hero of the Soviet Union. This is an award given to you by the Soviet people, and it is also an award given to you by us Chinese people and the people of the whole world, because you and your great Soviet army have excellently completed the task of saving the fate of all mankind. Dear Comrade Maresyev, your great patriotism and heroism deeply moved me. You are an outstanding son of the Soviet people, and you are an example for the people fighting for world peace. The Soviet people and the people of the world are proud and self-reliant to have such tenacious and brave warriors like you, and they are not afraid of the imperialists!

Now, American imperialism is actively arming Japan and West Germany, frantically preparing to launch a full-scale war of aggression, and they are using shameless means to obstruct the resumption of the Korean armistice talks. We must never tolerate their conspiracy to enslave the people of the world!

Dear Comrade Maresyev, the Chinese people firmly believe that the strength of the Soviet Union, China, and the peace-loving people of the world is fully capable of defeating imperialism. The Chinese War of Resistance Against Japan is a very obvious example. At that time, the Chinese people's armed forces were inferior to the enemy in terms of numbers and equipment. I remember when I first joined the army, our company had only seventy or eighty people, only fifty or so rifles, and very few light machine guns. Under such circumstances, we persisted in the War of Resistance and finally defeated Japanese imperialism together with the great Soviet army. We also defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries' offensive supported by the United States in the Third Civil War and liberated all the people of China. Now, the Chinese people not only have several million powerful land forces, with tanks and artillery, but also have a considerable number of air and naval forces. With such a strong army, coupled with the strong forces of the entire peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, we have full confidence in crushing the conspiracies of all warmongers who dare to undermine world peace and launch wars of aggression.

Finally, I hope that you can introduce us to your valuable combat experience, scientific and technological knowledge, and the happy life of the Soviet people. We are very willing to learn from you. I hope that the friendship between our two peoples of China and the Soviet Union will be increasingly consolidated and developed, and that we will achieve further victories in the great cause of defending world peace.

Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people! Long live the great teacher of world revolution, Stalin! Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao!

    学习苏联英雄伟大的爱国主义精神
    写给苏联“无脚飞将军”马列西也夫同志的信
    中国人民解放军战斗英雄  陈芝汉亲爱的阿·马列西也夫同志：
    在这伟大的苏联十月革命胜利三十四周年纪念日前夕，首先让我向你致以战斗的敬礼！
    亲爱的马列西也夫同志：我们虽然没有见过面，也没有谈过话，但是，你却给了我很深刻的印象。我在杂志上、电影里都看到了你在伟大的卫国战争中英勇的事迹。当我看到描写你战斗生活的电影的时候，我非常高兴，我兴奋得掉下眼泪来。你为了祖国，为了人民，勇敢地驾驶着飞机，与德国强盗们作战，最后因汽油烧干了，你从飞机上跳了下来，在那荒山雪地里，整整爬了十八昼夜，战胜了一切艰险、困难，终于回到了自己的队伍里；因而将你那两只腿冻掉了。但是，这丝毫没有削弱你的战斗意志，你不但没有因此悲观失望，或居功骄傲，反而以你那极坚韧的意志与恒心，学会了运用假腿的本领，达到了你继续驾驶驱逐机，继续战斗的愿望。当我们在电影上看到你重返前线，击落德寇飞机十一架的时候，我们是多么激动啊！敬爱的同志，你获得了苏联英雄的光荣称号，这是苏联人民给你的褒奖，也是我们中国人民，全世界人民给你的褒奖，因为你和你们伟大的苏联军队一起，出色地完成了挽救全人类命运的任务。亲爱的马列西也夫同志，你这种伟大的爱国主义、英雄主义的精神，深深地感动了我。你是苏联人民优秀的儿子，你是为争取世界和平而战斗着的人民的榜样。苏联人民和全世界人民，有你这样顽强、勇敢的战士，是值得骄傲自豪的，是不怕帝国主义者的！
    现在，美帝国主义正在积极地武装日本和西德，疯狂地准备发动全面侵略战争，他们并以无耻的手段，阻挠恢复朝鲜的停战谈判，他们这种妄想奴役全世界人民的阴谋，我们是决不能容忍的！
    亲爱的马列西也夫同志，中国人民坚决相信苏联、中国以及全世界爱好和平的人民的力量，是完全能够打败帝国主义的。中国抗日战争就是很明显的实例。在那时，中国人民的武装，在数量上、装备上，都不如敌人。记得我刚参军时，我们一个连，只有七八十个人，只有五十来枝步枪，轻机关枪是很少的。在那种情况下，我们坚持了抗战，最后与伟大的苏军一起打败了日本帝国主义。我们并在第三次国内战争中击败了有美国支持的国民党反动派的进攻，解放了全中国的人民。现在，中国人民不仅有了几百万强大的陆军，有了坦克、大炮，而且还有了相当数量的空军和海军。中国人民有了这样一支强大的军队，再加上以苏联为首的整个和平民主阵营的强大力量，我们是有充分的信心粉碎一切敢于破坏世界和平，发动侵略战争的战争贩子们的阴谋的。
    最后，希望你能够把你宝贵的战斗经验和科学技术知识以及苏联人民美满的生活情形介绍给我们，我们很愿意向你学习，希望我们中苏两国人民的友谊日益巩固和发展，在保卫世界和平的伟大事业里，取得进一步的胜利。中苏人民友好万岁！伟大的世界革命导师斯大林万岁！中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
