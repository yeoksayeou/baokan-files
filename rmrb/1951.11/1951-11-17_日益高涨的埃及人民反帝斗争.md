　　The Increasingly High Tide of Egyptian People's Anti-Imperialist Struggle

　　The Egyptian people held an unprecedented large-scale demonstration on the 13th of this month to commemorate the day when the Egyptian people heroically resisted the bloody aggression of British imperialism thirty-two years ago, and demanded that British troops immediately withdraw from the Suez Canal area and Sudan. This is a manifestation of the continued upsurge and development of the Egyptian people's patriotic movement for independence and autonomy.

　　Since the Egyptian government, under the firm demands of the Egyptian people, decided to abolish the unequal Anglo-Egyptian treaty in mid-October this year, the upsurge of the Egyptian people's struggle against British imperialism has reached an unprecedented height. In the Suez Canal area, which is illegally occupied by British imperialism, 72 percent of Egyptian workers have gone on strike, and 80 percent of Egyptian workers working for the British army have left the British military camps; Egyptian people from all walks of life have widely launched a patriotic movement to resist the British occupation army, and tens of thousands of Egyptian patriotic youths have demanded to be armed to resist the armed aggression of the British army.

　　This heroic patriotic action of the Egyptian people fully demonstrates their unwavering determination and firm will to strive for national independence and autonomy. British imperialism has adopted an extremely arrogant and shameless attitude towards the patriotic actions of the Egyptian people. It continues to send troops to the Suez Canal Zone and expand its occupied areas, attempting to intimidate the Egyptian people with bloody massacres and suppression. But this can only arouse greater hatred and more heroic and firm resistance from the Egyptian people. The patriotic actions launched by the Egyptian people everywhere are proof of this.

　　While the Egyptian people held patriotic demonstrations, the people of Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and other countries supported the Egyptian people with practical actions of general strikes. This shows that the unity of the people of the Middle East and North African countries in the struggle against imperialism has been further strengthened. This is a very important fact, because this unity is an important condition for the people of the Middle East and North African countries to inevitably achieve victory in the struggle against imperialism.

　　The Egyptian people and the people of the Middle East and North African countries, who have been oppressed and bullied by imperialism for decades, have become increasingly aware, united, and acted powerfully. In the face of such increasingly powerful people's forces, the imperialist aggressors are bound to suffer final defeat.

### 日益高涨的埃及人民反帝斗争

　　日益高涨的埃及人民反帝斗争
    埃及人民在本月十三日举行空前大规模的示威游行，纪念埃及人民在三十二年以前英勇反抗英帝国主义血腥侵略的斗争日，并要求英国军队立即自苏彝士运河地区和苏丹撤退。这是埃及人民要求独立自主的爱国运动继续高涨与发展的表现。
    自今年十月中旬埃及政府在埃及人民坚决要求下，决定废除英埃不平等条约以来，埃及人民反对英帝国主义斗争的热潮就空前地高涨起来。现在被英帝国主义所非法侵占的苏彝士运河地区，已有百分之七十二的埃及工人实行罢工，百分之八十为英军工作的埃及工人已离开了英国军营；埃及各阶层人民已广泛地展开了抵制英国占领军的爱国运动，成千成万的埃及爱国青年并要求武装起来，以抵抗英国军队的武装侵略。
    埃及人民这种英勇的爱国行动，充分表现了他们争取国家独立自主的不可动摇的决心和坚强意志。英帝国主义对埃及人民的爱国行动采取了极端蛮横无耻的态度，它继续向苏彝士运河区增兵，并扩大其侵占区，企图以血腥的屠杀和镇压来威吓埃及人民。但是这只能激起埃及人民更大的仇恨和更为英勇坚强的反抗。埃及人民在各处所展开的爱国行动，就是一个证明。
    在埃及人民举行爱国示威游行的同时，黎巴嫩、叙利亚、伊拉克等国人民，都以总罢工的实际行动来支援埃及人民。这说明了中东与北部非洲各国人民，在反对帝国主义斗争中的团结已进一步加强。这是一个十分重要事实，因为这种团结是中东与北部非洲各国人民在反对帝国主义斗争中必然取得胜利的重要条件。
    被帝国主义压迫欺负了几十年的埃及人民与中东和北非各国人民已日益觉悟并且团结起来和有力地行动起来了，在这样日益壮大的人民力量的面前，帝国主义侵略者是必然要遭受到最后的失败的。
