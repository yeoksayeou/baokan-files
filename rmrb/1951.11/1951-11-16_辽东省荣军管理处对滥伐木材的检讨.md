　　Liaoning Province Veterans Administration's Self-Criticism on Illegal Logging
    Editor: After we saw the criticism in the People's Daily on September 12th, page 2, from the Liaoning Provincial People's Government Forestry Administration regarding our department's illegal logging and illegal sales to private merchants, we immediately organized relevant cadres for inspection. The following is our self-criticism:
    I. We have not done enough to personally manage lower-level cadres and conduct timely and in-depth inspections, and there is a bureaucratic work style. After our department's subordinate, the Second Farm for Honored Veterans in Liuhe (hereinafter referred to as the Second Farm), signed a logging contract with the Liuhe County Carpentry and Masonry Union, our department not only failed to personally manage the Second Farm's work, but instead believed that "whoever makes a mistake is responsible," resulting in the serious loss of 900 cubic meters of timber due to the Carpentry and Masonry Union over-logging, and the Second Farm's serious violation of policy by selling timber to private merchants.
    II. We lack strict management and education of cadres, especially cadres of the Second Farm, and particularly lack policy education. The Second Farm sent Zhang Shuxian, the chief of the general affairs section, to Liuhe County to request the county government to divide the excess 900 cubic meters of logs equally, claiming that it was not enough for construction of the farm. Our department, without investigation, actually believed it to be true. The fact is that they wanted to sell it to increase the farm's petty cash. This is the deceitful behavior of Comrade Zhang Shuxian.
    III. Regarding the 350 cubic meters of logs sold to private merchants, it was initially sold by the farm. However, while it was being sold but not yet transported, it was stopped by the leading comrades of our department. Later, because the private merchant had already paid the farm, and the private merchant mentioned the losses and difficulties in the process, our department decided to sell the 350 cubic meters of logs to the private merchant, and the funds were used as the income of our department. Our department should bear the main responsibility for this issue.
    IV. Insufficient understanding of afforestation policies, arbitrary felling of young trees. Although this point was not published in the newspaper, our department should also sincerely examine itself. When the Second Farm began construction, it needed "scaffolding poles" (i.e., wooden poles used to build scaffolding). The farm, without the approval of the county government, privately sent people to cut down 1,000 scaffolding poles (later the county government approved 400), seriously damaging the young trees.

### 辽东省荣军管理处对滥伐木材的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　辽东省荣军管理处对滥伐木材的检讨
    编辑同志：我们看到九月十二日人民日报二版登载了辽东省人民政府林政处对我处滥伐木材并违法卖与私商的批评后，我们即组织有关干部进行检查。以下是我们的检讨：
    一、亲自掌握下层干部，及时深入检查工作作的不够，存在着官僚主义的工作作风。在我处所属柳河荣誉军人第二农场（以下简称第二农场）与柳河县木瓦工会订立采伐合同后，我处不但没有亲自掌握第二农场进行工作，反认为“谁作错，谁负责”，结果造成木瓦工会多伐了九○○公尺木材的严重损失和第二农场将木材卖给私商的严重违犯政策的错误行为。
    二、我们缺乏对干部特别是对第二农场的干部的严格管理和教育，尤其缺乏政策教育。第二农场派总务股长张述先到柳河县要求该县政府把多伐的九○○公尺原木拿出对半分，说是建场不够用，本处竟不经调查，信以为实。事实是他们要出卖以增加场方的小家务。这是张述先同志的欺骗行为。
    三、对于卖给私商的三五○公尺原木问题，是先经农场出卖的。但正在出卖而未运出的时候，就被我处领导同志阻止了。后因私商将款早已交与农场，私商并谈到在这过程中的损失和困难，而由本处决定将三五○公尺原木卖给了私商，其款作了本处的机关收入，本处应负这一问题的主要责任。
    四、对育林政策认识不够，任意砍伐幼林。这一点虽然报纸未登出，但我处亦应忠实检讨。当第二农场开始建设时，需用“架杆子”（即造房子时搭架所用木杆），该场在县政府未批准前，即私自派人砍伐架杆一千棵（以后县政府批给了四○○棵），严重地破坏了幼林。
