	Vast Number of Peasants Strive to Improve Yield Per Unit Area
	Eastern China Sees Universal Bumper Harvest of Various Crops This Year

	Eastern China has achieved a universal bumper harvest of various crops this year, exceeding the original agricultural production plan.

	Although Eastern China expanded the sown area for industrial raw material crops this year, relatively reducing the sown area for grain crops, thanks to the efforts of governments at all levels and the vast number of peasants to increase yield per unit area, according to preliminary statistics, the total output of various grain crops still increased by 16.34 percent compared to last year, exceeding the original plan for this year by 8.45 percent, reaching 95.88 percent of the pre-War of Resistance Against Japan grain production level in Eastern China. Among them, the increase in wheat production is the most significant. The total wheat production in the region this year exceeded last year by 44.6 percent. The reason for the increase in wheat production is due to vigorous water management, and both the Subei and Wanbei regions have achieved bumper harvests. The output of cotton, hemp, tobacco, and other crops in Eastern China this year has also greatly exceeded last year's records. The total cotton production in the region this year increased by 49.64 percent compared to last year, exceeding the original plan for this year by 8.1 percent, and exceeding the highest annual cotton production in Eastern China in 1937 by 7.2 percent. The total output of jute and kenaf increased by 93.8 percent compared to last year, exceeding the original plan for this year by 50.49 percent. The total output of flue-cured tobacco increased by 390.53 percent compared to last year, exceeding the original plan for this year by 69 percent.

	The yield per unit area of rice has significantly improved in various parts of Eastern China this year. In the Hang(zhou)-Jia(xing)-Hu(zhou) triangle area, known as the "land of fish and rice," the average yield of rice per mu this year has exceeded the normal yield of the area before the war. Shen Sanshan, a farmer in Lintang Village, Jiaxing County, Zhejiang Province, harvested 1,200 jin of rice per mu this year. Jiang Xiqiang, a farmer in Qili Village, Zhuji County, harvested 1,100 jin of double-cropping rice per mu. Tang Baoming, a labor model in Jiangyin County, Southern Jiangsu, harvested 1,199 jin of rice per mu. These individual high-yield records all exceed the local general yield by more than double. In addition, Wang Xiaowei, a farmer in Wendeng County, Shandong Province, harvested 675 jin of wheat per mu, and Xie Zongrong, a farmer in Laiwu County, Shandong Province, harvested 929 jin of millet per mu, both of which are rare high-yield records.

	This year's bumper harvest in Eastern China was achieved in the struggle to continuously overcome natural disasters. First of all, water management in the years since liberation has been successful, and the areas in Subei and Wanbei that often suffered from floods in the past have achieved bumper harvests this year. Southern flooding and northern drought were common phenomena in Eastern China this year. In the spring, Fujian, Zhejiang, and other places suffered from rotten rice seedlings due to continuous rain. Fortunately, the people's government immediately led the peasants to replant seedlings, and mobilized the peasants to borrow seedlings from each other during transplanting, ensuring the transplanting in the spring. Later, Zhejiang, Southern Jiangsu, Southern Anhui, and other provinces experienced drought and flooding. During droughts, the people's government mobilized peasants to draw water to irrigate fields, organizing labor and waterwheels to irrigate across mountains. In many places, such as the Ningbo area of Zhejiang Province, urban residents were also mobilized to support the peasants' struggle against drought. During floods, the people's government led the peasants to drain water. When Shandong Province was dry this spring, the people's government led the peasants to use the "water-carrying sowing" method to plant cotton on time. This year, insect pests were also widespread in Eastern China. Rice stem borers in Zhejiang, Fujian, and Southern Jiangsu provinces, locusts in Wanbei, Subei, and Shandong provinces, as well as cotton aphids and red spiders, which were prevalent everywhere, caused more serious damage. These insect pests were promptly captured and killed by the people's governments in various places, and were eradicated with the assistance of insecticides, machinery, and airplanes (for locust control). This year, a total of more than 9.6 million peasants in Wanbei, Shandong, and Subei provinces participated in locust control, and peasants in Zhejiang Province participated in stem borer control. This year, the coastal areas of Eastern China were also hit by typhoons, but because the people's government had made preparations in advance, and mobilized peasants to protect seawalls and crops when the typhoons struck, no major losses were caused.

	The peasants of Eastern China, who have achieved a bumper harvest, are responding to the call for increasing production and practicing economy, and are preparing to expand production next year. They will further increase the yield per unit area of various crops next year and strive for an even better harvest than this year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    广大农民努力提高单位面积产量
    华东区今年各种农作物普遍丰收
    华东区今年各种农作物普遍获得丰收，超额完成了原订的农业生产计划。
    华东今年虽因扩大了工业原料作物的播种面积，相对地缩小了粮食作物的播种面积，但由于各级人民政府和广大农民的努力，提高单位面积产量，据初步统计，各种粮食作物的总产量仍比去年增加了百分之十六点三四，并超过今年原订计划百分之八点四五，达到华东地区抗日战争前粮食生产水平的百分之九十五点八八。其中小麦增产最显著。全区今年小麦总产量，超过去年百分之四十四点六。小麦增产的原因是由于大力治水，苏北区和皖北区都丰收了。今年华东区棉、麻、烟等作物的产量，也大大超过去年的纪录。今年全区棉花的总产量比去年增加了百分之四十九点六四，超过今年原订计划百分之八点一，超过一九三七年华东区棉花最高年产量的百分之七点二。黄麻和洋麻的总产量比去年增加百分之九十三点八，超过今年原订计划百分之五十点四九。烤烟的总产量较去年增加百分之三百九十点五三，超过今年原订计划百分之六十九。
    今年华东区各地水稻的单位面积产量都有显著提高。向称“鱼米之乡”的杭（州）嘉（兴）湖（州）三角地带，今年每亩水稻的平均产量，已经超过了该区战前的常年产量。浙江省嘉兴县麟塘村农民沈三山今年的水稻，每亩收一千二百斤。诸暨县七里村农民蒋锡强的双季稻，每亩收一千一百斤。苏南区江阴县劳动模范唐宝铭的水稻，每亩收一千一百九十九斤。这些个别的丰产纪录，都超过当地一般产量的一倍以上。此外，山东省文登县农民王小为，每亩小麦收了六百七十五斤，该省莱芜县农民谢宗荣，每亩谷子收九百二十九斤，都是少有的丰产纪录。
    华东区今年的丰收，是在不断战胜自然灾害的斗争中得来的。首先是解放后数年来治水有成绩，往年苏北、皖北常有水灾的地区今年丰收了。南涝北旱是华东各地今年的普遍现象。春天，福建、浙江等地就因霪雨烂了稻秧。幸亏人民政府马上领导农民补种秧田，插秧的时候又发动农民互相借秧苗，才保证了春天的插秧。以后，浙江、苏南、皖南等省区时旱时涝。旱的时候人民政府就发动农民车水灌田，把劳力和水车组织起来越山灌溉。好些地方，如浙江省宁波专区并曾发动城市人民支援农民的抗旱斗争。涝的时候，人民政府又领导农民排水。山东省今春旱的时候，人民政府则领导农民用“运水点种”的办法，才按时种上了棉花。今年华东的虫害也很普遍，浙江、福建、苏南等省的水稻螟虫，皖北、苏北、山东等省区的蝗虫，以及遍及各地的棉蚜和红蜘蛛为害都较严重。这些虫害都经各地人民政府发动农民及时捕打，并在除虫药械和飞机（灭蝗）的援助下扑灭了。皖北、山东、苏北三省区今年参加灭蝗的农民，和浙江省参加治螟的农民，共达九百六十多万人。今年，华东沿海地区还受台风的袭击，但因人民政府预有防备，台风袭来时又发动农民抢护海塘、田禾，才未造成重大损失。
    丰收了的华东农民，响应增产节约的号召，正在为明年扩大生产作准备。他们要在明年进一步提高各种农作物的单位面积产量，争取比今年更好的丰收。（新华社）
