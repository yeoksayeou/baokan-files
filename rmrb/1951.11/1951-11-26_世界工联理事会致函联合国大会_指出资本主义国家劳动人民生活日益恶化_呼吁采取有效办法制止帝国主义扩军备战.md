Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 24th. According to TASS Berlin, November 24th: The World Federation of Trade Unions Council Berlin meeting adopted a letter to the United Nations General Assembly on the 21st, stating: The World Federation of Trade Unions Council asks the United Nations General Assembly to pay attention to the poverty of working people in capitalist and colonial countries, a situation that has been further exacerbated by the imperialist governments' frantic arms expansion movement. These governments use large sums of money for war preparations, while on the other hand, they greatly reduce funding for cultural and social undertakings. In capitalist and colonial countries, real wages are falling, prices are rising, the tax burden is increasing, the cost of living is rising, inflation is becoming more serious, and trade union rights are being violated. At the same time, the hunger and poverty of the working people enable monopoly capitalists to obtain huge profits.

The continuous deterioration of the economic situation of the working people causes alarm and anxiety to all honest people in the world. Workers and staff in capitalist countries, colonies, and dependencies are increasingly determined to oppose the poverty-creating policies that imperialist governments force them to accept.

Since the World Federation of Trade Unions represents the interests of the working people of the world, it cannot remain silent on their demands. Therefore, the World Federation of Trade Unions is issuing an appeal to the United Nations General Assembly. We believe that in the current situation, taking practical measures to improve the situation of the working people is extremely necessary. The World Federation of Trade Unions Council requests the United Nations General Assembly to recommend that the Economic and Social Council consider the various recommendations we have made to the Council. We ask the General Assembly to recommend that the Economic and Social Council quickly formulate practical action plans to raise the living standards of the working masses, improve social legislation, expand and protect trade union rights, and promote normal economic relations between countries.

The World Federation of Trade Unions Council fully supports the World Peace Council's letter to the United Nations and the people of the world. The World Federation of Trade Unions firmly advocates taking effective measures to oppose the arms expansion movement and stop another world war. These measures must first include: gradual and simultaneous disarmament, banning atomic weapons, ending the Korean War, withdrawing aggressive troops from the territories and territorial waters of other countries, non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and concluding a five-power peace pact. The working people of the world demand that the huge sums of money used to produce munitions be used to improve the living standards and cultural standards of the people of all countries.

    世界工联理事会致函联合国大会
    指出资本主义国家劳动人民生活日益恶化
    呼吁采取有效办法制止帝国主义扩军备战 【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十四日讯：世界工会联合会理事会柏林会议在二十一日通过的致联合国大会书说：世界工联理事会请联合国大会注意资本主义国家和殖民地国家劳动人民的贫困，这种情况已因帝国主义政府的疯狂的扩军运动而更加恶化了。这些政府把大量款项用来从事战争准备，而另方面却大大地削减文化和社会事业的经费。在资本主义国家和殖民地国家，实际工资在下降，物价在上涨，纳税的负担在加重，生活费用在上升，通货膨胀日趋严重，工会的权利受到侵犯。同时，劳动人民的饥饿和贫穷却使垄断资本家获得巨额的利润。
    劳动人民经济状况的不断恶化，使全世界一切正直的人们都感到惊恐和焦虑。资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国的工人和职员越来越坚决地反对帝国主义政府强使他们接受的制造贫穷的政策。
    世界工联既然是代表全世界劳动人民的利益，就不能对他们的要求一言不发。因此，世界工联要向联合国大会发出呼吁。我们认为，在目前情况下，采取切实办法来改善劳动人民的处境，是极为必要的。世界工联理事会要求联合国大会建议经社理事会考虑我们向该理事会提出的各项建议。我们要求大会建议经社理事会赶快订出实际的行动计划，来提高劳动群众的生活水准，改进社会立法，扩大和保障工会的权利，以及促进各国之间的正常经济关系。
    世界工联理事会完全支持世界和平理事会告联合国与世界各国人民书。世界工联坚决主张采取有效办法来反对扩军运动和制止另一次大战。这些办法首先必须包括：逐步而又同时地裁减军备，禁止原子武器，结束朝鲜战争，从其他国家的领土和领海撤退侵略军队，不干涉其他各国人民的内政，缔结五大国和平公约。世界劳动人民要求把生产军火的巨额经费用来提高各国人民的生活水准和文化水准。
