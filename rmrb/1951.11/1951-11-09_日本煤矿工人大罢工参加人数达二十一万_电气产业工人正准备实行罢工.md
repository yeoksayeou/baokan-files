Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th: Japanese coal miners' strike participation due to demands for wage increases has exceeded 210,000 people, reducing Japan's daily coal production by 60 percent. After conducting a 48-hour strike on October 31st and November 1st, workers from seven major Japanese coal mining companies, including "Mitsui" and "Mitsubishi," continued with a 72-hour strike from the 2nd because the capitalists still refused to accept the workers' demands for wage increases. Workers from another large Japanese coal mining company, "Furukawa," also joined this strike. Starting from the 5th, workers from these eight major coal mining companies entered their second 72-hour strike.

At the same time, workers from six large coal mining companies in Kyushu Island are also persisting in their indefinite strike. Coal miners in the Joban area of central Honshu also began striking from the 5th. In this way, the total number of coal miners participating in the strike throughout Japan has increased to more than 210,000. According to Japanese newspapers, a strike of this scale means a daily loss of 90,000 tons of coal, accounting for 60 percent of Japan's daily coal production.

In addition, electrical industry workers are also negotiating with capitalists regarding demands for wage increases. If negotiations break down, workers are also prepared to strike.

The "Japan Times" commented: "Prolonging the disputes in these two basic industries will paralyze the country's economy."

    日本煤矿工人大罢工参加人数达二十一万
    电气产业工人正准备实行罢工
    【新华社七日讯】东京消息：日本煤矿工人因要求增加工资而参加罢工斗争的人数已超过二十一万人，使日本每日煤产量减少百分之六十。“三井”、“三菱”等日本七个大煤矿公司的工人在十月三十一日、十一月一日进行了四十八小时的罢工之后，因为资方仍然拒绝接受工人的增加工资的要求，又从二日起继续进行了七十二小时的罢工。另一日本大煤矿公司——“古河”公司的工人也参加了这一罢工。从五日开始，这八大煤矿公司的工人又进入了第二次的七十二小时罢工。
    与此同时，九州岛六个大煤矿公司的工人也在坚持他们的无限期罢工。本州中部常磐地区的煤矿工人，也从五日起开始罢工。这样，全日本煤矿工人参加罢工的总数已增加到二十一万多人。据日本报纸估计，这样规模的罢工意味着每天损失九万吨煤，占全日本每日煤产量的百分之六十。
    此外，电气产业工人也因要求增加工资在和资方谈判。如果谈判破裂，工人也准备实行罢工。
    “日本时报”评论说：“这两个基本工业的争端拖延下去，将使国家的经济陷于瘫痪状态。”
