　　The Valiant Artillery in the Battle of Ma Liang Mountain
  　Zhang Tao
    In the battles to shatter Van Fleet’s “Autumn Offensive,” the artillery units of the Chinese People’s Volunteer Army demonstrated powerful might. In the battle to defend Ma Liang Mountain, a certain artillery unit was commended by the Volunteer Army leadership for their outstanding combat achievements. From October 1st to 9th, they killed or wounded 3,094 enemies, assisting the infantry in crushing the enemy's offensive. The infantry units also affectionately presented them with two large red flags, both inscribed with: "Valiant Artillery."
    At 10:00 AM on October 4th, two infantry companies and one chemical mortar company of the enemy advanced to the 199.4 height southeast of Ma Liang Mountain, attempting to invade our main peak of Ma Liang Mountain. The observers of our artillery unit reported this situation to the commanders. In less than five minutes, our first trial-fired shell hit the target, followed by a barrage of artillery fire that rained down on the enemy's positions, causing the enemy to scatter in all directions, yelling and screaming. Two of the enemy's four chemical mortars were also destroyed.
    Later, our artillery also received the task of supporting the infantry's counterattack on Height 280 of Ma Liang Mountain. At that time, the enemy used twenty-four aircraft and many long-range guns to concentrate their bombardment on our artillery positions. Trees were broken and the grass was set ablaze, but the heroic artillerymen remained calm and accurately fired at the enemy. A gasoline bomb landed near the muzzle of one of our artillery pieces, and the burning liquid flowed into the position. Artilleryman Li Fengling quickly extinguished the fire with soil. The artillerymen looked at the many unexploded enemy shells lying nearby and burst into laughter. One artilleryman said: "The enemy is so disoriented by our attack! They even forgot to remove the 'fuse safety' and sent over unexploded shells in a muddle." But our shells, like linked beads, continuously bombarded the enemy on Height 280, turning the enemy's two infantry companies into a bloody mess, making them disoriented, and the enemy's artillery was unable to retaliate. Our infantry units then launched an assault and quickly occupied Height 280.
    Later, the enemy, with more than a battalion of troops, supported by more than twenty aircraft and four tanks, launched a fierce attack on our Height 216.8 southwest of Ma Liang Mountain, attempting to outflank the rear of Ma Liang Mountain, and concentrated about a battalion of troops in Jinchi Cave, west of Height 216.8, to coordinate their frontal attack. The warriors of our artillery unit used fierce artillery fire to first disrupt the enemy in Jinchi Cave, and then cooperated with the infantry to defeat the attacking enemy thirteen times in a row. The last artillery bombardment was even more fierce, with one row of shells following another, from the mountainside all the way to the foot of the mountain. At first, one could still hear the sound of the shells leaving the barrels and the sound of explosions, but later only the earth-shaking roar could be heard. The enemy, crawling up the mountain, was thrown into chaos and scrambled to escape.
    "Never let the enemy escape!" Third artilleryman Wang Laichen loaded a shell, and without waiting for the fourth artilleryman to use the ramrod, he pushed the shell into the barrel with his fist, and as soon as he pulled the lanyard, the shell roared away. He fired hundreds of shells in a single breath, and the soldiers who participated in transporting and cleaning the shells happily shouted: "Be fast, be accurate, be fierce! The American devils are waiting for refreshments!" In the artillery fire, a few enemies who managed to escape by luck ran to the small road, only to be intercepted by our artillery fire again, scaring them into turning around and scurrying north, huddling in a pine forest below Height 216.8. At this time, from our artillery command post, another command of "Concentrated Fire" was issued, and shells fell into the forest like a torrential rain, finally tearing the enemy to shreds. In this day's battle, our valiant artillery cooperated with twenty-two infantry warriors, killing or wounding more than 500 enemies, while suffering only six casualties. The soldiers laughed and said: "Let the American devils come! Let us beat you up like this again."
    At the end of the victorious battle, cheers rang out on our military position. The artillerymen sent the cigarettes that the people of the motherland had sent to comfort the infantry in the forward positions, and the brave infantry also sent representatives with chestnuts and other things from the leaders to comfort the artillery. The infantry and artillerymen warmly embraced each other, praising each other's bravery. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　马良山阻击战中神勇的炮兵
  　张涛
    在粉碎范佛里特“秋季攻势”的战斗里，志愿军炮兵部队的炮兵，发挥了强大的威力。在马良山阻击战中，某炮兵部队因战功卓著，曾得到志愿军领导机关的表扬。他们从十月一日到九日共杀伤敌人三千零九十四名，协助步兵粉碎了敌人的进攻。步兵部队也亲切地送给他们两面大红旗，上面都写着：“神勇的炮兵”。
    十月四日十时，敌人两个步兵连和一个化学迫击炮连，进到马良山东南一九九点四高地，企图进犯我马良山主峰。我炮兵部队的观测员向指挥员报告了这一情况。不到五分钟，我第一发试射的炮弹即命中目标，接着群炮齐鸣，炮弹像雨点似地倾泻在敌人的阵地上，打得敌人东奔西窜，叫喊连天。敌人的四门化学迫击炮也被打坏了两门。
    后来我们的炮兵又接受了支援步兵反击马良山二八零高地的任务。当时敌人用了二十四架飞机和许多远射程炮集中轰击我炮兵阵地，树被打断了，草地也烧了起来，但是英雄的炮手们依然沉着而准确地射击着敌人。有一颗汽油弹落在我们炮兵的一个炮口附近，燃烧着的液体流进了阵地，炮手李凤岭忙用土把火扑灭。炮手们看了看落在附近的敌人许多没打响的炮弹，不由得哄然大笑起来。有个炮手说：“敌人叫咱们打蒙啦！他们连‘引信保险’都忘了摘，糊里糊涂地把不响的炮弹都送过来了。”而我们的炮弹却像联珠一样，连连地轰击着二八零高地上的敌人，把敌人两个连的步兵打得血肉横飞，昏头转向，敌人的炮也被打得不能还击。我步兵部队随即发起冲锋，迅速占领了二八零高地。
    以后敌人又以一个多营的兵力，在二十多架飞机、四辆战车的配合下，向我马良山西南的二一六点八高地发起猛攻，妄图迂回到马良山侧后，另在二一六点八高地西侧的金尺洞，集中了约一个营的兵力策应其正面的攻击。我炮兵部队的勇士们便用猛烈的炮火，首先打乱金尺洞的敌人，接着又配合步兵连续十三次地打垮冲锋的敌人。最后一次的炮击，更是猛烈无比，一排炮弹接着一排炮弹，从山腰一直打到山脚下，起初还听得出炮弹的出口声，爆炸声，后来只能听到山岳震动的巨鸣。向山上蠕动着的敌人，被打得乱成一团，争相逃命。
    “决不让敌人跑掉！”三炮手王来臣装上炮弹，等不及四炮手用顶弹棍来顶，便用拳头一顶把炮弹送进了炮膛，顺手一拉火，炮弹就飞啸而去了。他一鼓劲接连发射了几百发炮弹，参加运炮弹和擦炮弹的战士都高兴地喊道：“要快、要准、要猛呀，美国鬼子等着吃点心呢！”在炮火中，侥幸脱逃的少数敌人，刚跑到小公路上，又遭到我炮火的截击，吓得扭回头来往北窜，猬集到二一六点八高地下面的一处松树林里。这时从我们的炮兵指挥所里，却又发出了一声“集中射击”的口令，炮弹又像狂雨一样落到了树林里，终于把敌人打得稀烂。这一天的战斗，我神勇的炮兵配合二十二个步兵勇士，杀伤了五百多名敌人，而自己只伤亡六个人。战士们笑着说：“美国鬼子尽管来吧，让老子就这样再揍你一揍。”
    在战斗胜利结束的时候，我军阵地上欢声雷动，炮兵们把祖国人民慰劳的香烟送去慰劳前沿阵地的步兵，英勇的步兵也派代表带着首长慰劳的栗子等，慰问炮兵，步兵炮兵热烈的拥抱在一起，互相称赞着彼此的英勇。（新华社）
