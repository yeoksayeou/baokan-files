　　After Seeing American Atrocities in Korea,
    I Cleansed My Remaining Pro-American Thoughts
    Comrade Editor: After seeing the ten photos of American atrocities published on the fourth page of the People's Daily on the 15th of this month, I was extremely angry. The heinous crimes committed by the American murderers in Korea reminded me of the blood debt owed by the Japanese invaders in central Hebei during the War of Resistance Against Japan. The madness of American imperialism today has surpassed that of the Japanese fascist bandits at that time. Such inhuman and barbaric behavior will inevitably be subjected to the just sanctions of all mankind, just like its predecessors Hitler and Tojo. These photos deeply educated me. They not only cleansed my remaining pro-American thoughts from the past, but also made me more clearly aware of the justice and necessity of our vigorous movement to resist America and aid Korea. We should always be vigilant and must give a head-on blow to the evil conspiracies and actions of American imperialism to infringe upon our beautiful lives. In the future, I will definitely step up my work to resist America and aid Korea.　Wang Hanting

　　看到美国在朝鲜的暴行后
    我肃清了残余的崇美思想
    编辑同志：当我看了人民日报本月十五日第四版所刊载的美军暴行的十张照片之后，我愤怒极了。美国杀人犯在朝鲜干下的这种滔天罪行，使我想起了抗日战争时，日寇在冀中所欠下的大血债。今日的美帝国主义的疯狂程度已经超过了当时的日本法西斯强盗了。这种灭绝人性的野蛮行为，其结果必然和它底先辈希特勒、东条一样，一定要受到全体人类的正义制裁。这几张照片深深地教育了我，它非但肃清了我过去所残存的崇美思想，而且还使我更清楚地认识到我们所进行的轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动的正义性与必要性；我们应该永远警惕着，对于美国帝国主义侵犯我们美好的生活的罪恶阴谋和行动，必须给以迎头痛击。今后我一定加紧做好抗美援朝工作。　王汉霆
