    Harbin Private Ruilin Knitting Factory
    Arbitrarily Requires Overtime, Damaging Workers' Health
    The City's Labor Bureau Has Appropriately Handled the Matter

    To the Editor: The Harbin Private Ruilin Knitting Factory contracted with the Songjiang Provincial Company of the China General Merchandise Company on August 17th to process 500 sets of autumn clothing, with a delivery deadline of two months. When the factory accepted this work, it was clear that, based on its existing production capacity, it would be necessary to work overtime for four hours each day to meet the deadline. However, solely to pursue profits, the factory, without the approval of the Harbin Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau or the consent of the factory's trade union, arbitrarily decided to work overtime for three or four hours each day, and sometimes even six or nine hours. As a result of continuous overtime, technicians like Yu Changsheng eventually fell ill due to overwork. This illegal behavior of the factory did not start with this incident; in July of this year, there was a similar situation of working overtime for three hours without authorization. Now, based on the above facts revealed by the factory's trade union, the Harbin Municipal Labor Bureau has taken appropriate action. The capitalist is responsible for the medical expenses and wages of technicians like Yu Changsheng, and wages will continue to be paid until Yu Changsheng and others can return to work.

        Editor's Note: The actions of the capitalists of the Kaifeng Private Chengshi Waist Drum Shop and the Harbin Private Ruilin Knitting Factory, who disregarded workers' health and arbitrarily extended working hours to cruelly exploit workers, are not permitted in a country led by the working class today. The Harbin Municipal Labor Bureau has taken appropriate action regarding the erroneous behavior of the capitalist of the Ruilin Knitting Factory. The relevant departments in Kaifeng should also strictly handle the illegal behavior of the Chengshi Waist Drum Shop in that city.

    哈尔滨市私营瑞林针织厂
    擅自加班损害工人健康
    该市劳动局已予适当处理
    编辑同志：哈尔滨市私营瑞林针织厂于八月十七日承揽了中国百货公司松江省公司加工的五百套秋衣，约期两个月交货。该厂在承揽该活时，明知按工厂现有生产能力，必须每天加班四个钟点才能按期完成任务。但该厂单纯为了追逐利润，未经哈尔滨市人民政府劳动局的备案批准和该厂工会的同意，竟自行决定每天加班三、四个钟点，有时甚至加班六个钟点或九个钟点。由于连续加班的结果，技工于长盛等终于因劳动过度而病倒。该厂的这种违法行为，并不是从这次开始的，在今年七月份就有过擅自加班三小时的情形。现哈尔滨市劳动局根据该厂工会所揭发的上述事实，已作了适当的处理。资方负责技工于长盛等的医药费，工资照发，直至于长盛等能恢复工作为止。曲从先　薛俭
        编者按：开封市私营诚实腰鼓店、哈尔滨市私营瑞林针织厂资方不顾工人健康，擅自延长工作时间的残酷剥削工人的行为，是今天以工人阶级为领导的国家所不容许的。哈尔滨市劳动局已对瑞林针织厂资方的错误行为，作了适当的处理。开封市有关部门，对该市诚实腰鼓店的违法行为，也应严格处理。
