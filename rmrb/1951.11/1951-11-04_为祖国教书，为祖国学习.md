    Teaching for the Motherland, Learning for the Motherland
    Li Gao
    While American youth are busy damaging their bodies, feigning illness, bribing medical examiners, forging documents, and exhausting all means to evade the warmongers' conscription laws, the youth of our country are enthusiastically responding to the call of the motherland. In the past year, the number of young people who have applied to military cadre schools twice has reached 580,000. If these 580,000 young people joined hands, they would form a Great Wall two thousand miles long. The vast majority of these young people come from our schools.
    People know that the teachers and students of our schools have had tragic experiences. According to incomplete records on a statistical table issued on August 28, 1948, by the "United Association of Students from Five Universities in Beijing to Oppose Persecution and Rescue Arrested Classmates" before liberation, from the date of "Beijing University Preparatory Class student Shen Chong being raped by American soldier Pearson" on December 24, 1946, to the date of the Kuomintang bandit army "tightening the encirclement of Beijing University" on August 23, 1948, in just twenty months, the Kuomintang bandit gang supported by American imperialism persecuted teachers and students in universities in various places in a total of 184 incidents, killing and wounding more than 700 people, and arresting more than 1,100 people. Today, representatives of people's teachers and students are discussing national plans with representatives of the people at the CPPCC meetings. In the past two years, our great motherland has made great achievements in educational construction, and the number of children enrolled in schools has exceeded the highest year of the Kuomintang rule by 45 percent. The motherland's rapidly advancing construction cause is summoning the students everywhere, and this year's number of university graduates nationwide is still less than one-tenth of what is needed. The People's Government cares for our students and teachers with boundless enthusiasm. This summer vacation, thousands of the people's children have spent pleasant summer camp lives on the shores of Beidaihe, on Mount Luojia, and on the banks of the Songhua River. The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government directly leads the political studies of 3,000 university teachers in Beijing and Tianjin, and Premier Zhou personally gives reports to the teachers.
    Hatred for the enemy and today's happiness inspire us with boundless love for our motherland. When American imperialism brought the flames of war close to the Yalu River last winter, more than 52 million students and millions of teachers across the country enthusiastically devoted themselves to the patriotic movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea. Many young people went to the front lines in Korea, and many schools consciously strengthened education in patriotism. Teachers at Nanjing Municipal No. 1 Middle School put forward the slogans "Enter the classroom with patriotic feelings" and "Teach for the motherland." They carefully formulated teaching plans for a semester and wrote teaching notes for each lesson. They repeatedly discussed in teaching research groups how to integrate the content of patriotic education into teaching and how to move students' thoughts and feelings during lectures. For example, when language teacher Zhou Benchun lectured on Robeson's "I Am an American," he explained from the tragic story of Robeson's brother being needlessly pushed down by a white man and run over by a car, that this kind of thing is commonplace for imperialism against the people of enslaved nations. He guided the students to recall the various atrocities committed by the US military in Nanjing during the Kuomintang rule, and combined it with the day's newspaper reports on the establishment of ten death concentration camps by American imperialism in Korea, so that the students could further recognize the brutality and shamelessness of American imperialism. The arithmetic teachers at the First Primary School attached to Beijing Municipal Normal School collected figures on national industrial and agricultural production, transportation construction, and mineral resources to create arithmetic problems, so that students could recognize the greatness of our motherland through calculations of various actual figures. Our patriotic education is also full of the spirit of internationalism, so that we can better understand our great friends. When Wu Ji'an, a teacher at Jining Middle School in Shandong, talked about the Soviet Union conquering nature and utilizing nature, he quoted Vyshinsky's speech at the United Nations General Assembly: "The Soviet Union is, with the help of atomic energy, leveling mountains, irrigating deserts, clearing jungles, eliminating swamps, and spreading life, joy, prosperity, and happiness to the wilderness where no one has set foot for thousands of years." He pointed out that the same atomic energy is used by the Soviet Union to benefit mankind, while American imperialism uses it as a tool to intimidate and harm the people of the world. He organized the students to recall the development of production and construction in various people's democratic countries that they had talked about before, and explained from the two social development prospects of the world's peace and democracy camp and the imperialist camp that imperialism is bound to fail and the people of the world are bound to win. In many schools, patriotic education is not only carried out in the teaching of various subjects, but also the current affairs news in the daily newspaper, every school social activity, and even playing a game or watching a movie, have become good materials for carrying out patriotic education for students.
    The implementation of patriotic education has not only enabled the vast number of students to recognize the greatness of the motherland, but also made them know why today's people's motherland is great, so that they know how to better love and defend their great motherland. In the spring and summer of this year, 120 students from the Beijing Normal University Affiliated Girls' Middle School resolutely and happily took up posts in national defense construction during two military cadre school movements. Because the school usually conducts relatively full patriotic education, they showed good organization in obeying assignments. For example, when filling out the application form, teachers and students had individual talks: "You are willing to join the air force, but the assigned job can only be as a radio operator on the ground, are you willing?" "You volunteer to join the navy, but the job assigned to you is completely out of sight of the sea, are you willing?" The students' answers were always: "Yes, as long as the motherland needs me, as long as you approve me!" What lovely young people! Students at Nanjing Municipal No. 1 Middle School put forward the slogan "Learn for the Motherland." They regard their poor learning as a loss to the motherland. If they do not learn a subject well, they shout to attack that subject. The teacher's tutoring and students' mutual assistance have been strengthened. The overall academic performance of the students in the school has improved significantly this year, and the average score on the term exam has increased by 2.5 points compared with the first term of 1948. Patriotic education has encouraged students across the country to actively care about politics and participate in various patriotic movements inside and outside the school. In this year's popular and in-depth anti-US aggression and aid Korea propaganda movement, students from various places have become a very important force in the propaganda team. In order to donate airplanes and cannons, students at Tsinghua University participated in hundreds of kinds of voluntary labor. They formulated insecticides under the hot summer sun, and they responsibly drew and designed for engineering agencies; they trekked thousands of miles to the mountains of Zhejiang to collect geological specimens during the summer vacation. In this way, Tsinghua University has now overfulfilled the production increase and donation plan of 450 million yuan. There are also many students who give up their leisurely vacation lives and go out of school to serve the people: students in East China participate in the work of repairing the Huai River in heavy rain and snow; students in North China help farmers catch insects and fight drought under the scorching sun; students in Beijing travel to the grasslands of Inner Mongolia and Shandong and northern Jiangsu to prevent and treat diseases for local farmers and herdsmen.
    With the popularization and deepening of patriotic education, many teachers and students of church schools who have been deceived and suppressed by imperialists for a long time have also awakened. They resolutely severed ties with imperialism. Some even resolutely accused and reported imperialist elements lurking in the school. A student at Xiangya Medical College in Changsha, Hunan, was a Christian who used to admire the air of "British and American gentry." He ate and wore all imported goods. In 1946, he once sat in a jeep with the US military in Shanghai, and for a long time he still considered this to be supreme glory. The movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea changed his pro-American and worship-American thinking, and patriotic ideological education made him see the bright and splendid future of the great motherland, and he was determined to work hard to participate in the Three-Self Patriotic Movement. The vice-president of Lingnan University in Guangzhou, who had received American subsidies for 48 years, said, "In the past, we faced the United States, but now we face Beijing."
    In the past year, patriotic education in schools at all levels in our country has had a good start, but the shortcomings are still serious. Many schools and teachers have not paid attention to patriotic education, and many teachers are still teaching with their own wrong views. Our teachers should intensify their studies under the banner of patriotism, transform their thinking, and continue to strengthen the content of patriotism in our school education. (Attached picture)

    为祖国教书，为祖国学习
    李高
    当美国的青年们忙着在毁伤身体、装病装疯、贿买检查体格的医生、伪造证件，想尽种种办法逃避战争贩子们的征兵法令的时候，我国的青年却在热烈地响应祖国的号召，一年来两次报名投考军事干部学校的青年，就有五十八万人之多。五十八万青年拉起手来，就是一道二千里的长城。这些青年绝大部分来自我们的学校。
    人们都知道我国学校的师生曾经有过悲惨的经历。据解放前北京五个大学学生的“反迫害营救被捕同学联合会”在一九四八年八月二十八日印发的一张统计表上的不完全记载，从一九四六年十二月二十四日“北京大学先修班女生沈崇被美国兵皮尔逊强奸”开始，到一九四八年八月二十三日国民党匪军“宪警加紧包围北京大学”为止，在短短的二十个月里，美帝国主义所支持的国民党匪帮迫害各地大学师生的事件共发生了一百八十四起，打死打伤了七百多人，逮捕的在一千一百人以上。而今天，人民教师和学生的代表在政协会议上和全国人民的代表讨论着国家大计。伟大祖国两年来在教育建设上已获很大成绩，入学儿童人数已超过国民党统治时代最高年份百分之四十五。祖国突飞猛进的建设事业处处在召唤着同学们，今年全国大学毕业生还不够需要的十分之一。人民政府以无限的热忱关怀着我们的学生与教师。今年暑假中，成千的人民子弟已在北戴河边，在璐珈山上，在松花江畔度过了愉快的夏令营生活。中央人民政府教育部直接领导北京天津的三千大学教师的政治学习，周总理亲自为教师们作报告。
    对敌人的仇恨和今天的幸福激发我们对于自己的祖国怀抱无限的热爱。当去年冬季美帝国主义把战火烧近鸭绿江边的时候，全国五千二百多万学生和数百万教师热烈地投入了抗美援朝的爱国运动。许多青年走上了朝鲜前线，许多学校自觉地加强了爱国主义的教育。南京市立第一中学的教师，提出了“带着爱国主义的感情进课堂”，“为祖国而教”的口号。他们精心地制订一学期的教学计划和写出每节课的教学笔记，在教学研究小组内反复讨论如何在教学中贯穿爱国主义教育的内容，研究讲课时如何打动学生的思想感情。例如语文教师周本淳在讲罗伯逊的“我在美国”的课文时，他从罗伯逊的哥哥被白人无端推倒以致被汽车辗伤致死的悲惨故事，说明这种事是帝国主义对被奴役民族人民的家常便饭；他引导同学回忆国民党统治时期美军在南京的种种暴行，又结合当天报纸上关于美帝国主义在朝鲜设立十座死亡集中营的报道，使学生进一步认识美帝国主义的残暴和无耻。北京市立师范学校附属第一小学的算术教师，搜集了全国工农业生产、交通建设和矿产富源的数字制成算术题，使学生通过各种实际数字的计算，认识我们祖国的伟大。我们的爱国主义的教育，还充满了国际主义的精神，更好地认识我们伟大的友人。山东济宁中学教师吴济安，在讲述苏联征服自然并利用自然的情况时，引用维辛斯基在联合国大会上的发言：“苏联正在原子能的帮助下，削平山岳，灌溉沙漠，劈开丛林，消灭沼泽，把生命，快乐，繁荣与幸福散布于数千年人迹不到的荒野。”他指出同一原子能，苏联用来造福人类，而美帝国主义却用来作为恐吓和残害世界人民的工具。他组织学生们回忆以前讲过的各人民民主国家生产建设发展的情况，从世界和平民主阵营与帝国主义阵营两种社会发展的前途，说明帝国主义必败与世界人民必胜。在许多学校里，爱国主义教育不仅贯彻在各科教学中进行，每天报纸上的时事消息，每一次学校的社会活动，甚至做一次游戏，看一场电影，都成了向学生进行爱国主义教育的好材料。
    爱国主义教育的实施，不仅使广大学生认识了祖国的伟大，而且使他们知道了今天的人民祖国为什么伟大，从而知道如何更好地去热爱和保卫自己伟大的祖国。北京师范大学附属女子中学，在今春今夏两次参加军事干部学校运动中，有一百二十人坚决愉快地走上了国防建设的岗位。由于学校中平常比较充分地进行了爱国主义的教育，她们在服从分配上表现了很好的组织性。例如在填表报名时教师和同学们作了个别谈话：“你愿意参加空军，可是分配的工作只能在地面上当报务员，你愿意吗？”“你志愿参加海军，但分配你的工作却完全看不到海，你愿意吗？”同学们的回答总是：“愿意，只要祖国需要我，只要你批准我！”这是多么可爱的青年啊！南京市立第一中学学生，提出了“为祖国而学”的口号。他们把自己学习不好当做祖国的一种损失。有一门功课学不好就喊向那一门功课进攻。教师的辅导和同学的互助都加强了。全校学生今年上期的学习成绩显著提高，期考平均分数比一九四八年上期增加了二点五分。爱国主义教育鼓舞了全国学生积极关心政治、参加校内校外各项爱国运动。在今年的普及深入抗美援朝宣传运动中，各地学生成为了宣传队伍中极重要的力量。清华大学学生为了捐献飞机大炮，参加了成百种义务劳动，他们在盛夏的太阳光下配制杀虫剂，他们以负责态度为工程机关绘图设计；他们在暑假中跋涉千里到浙江山地里去采集地质标本。就是这样，清华大学到现在就超额完成了四亿五千万元的增产捐献计划。还有许多学生放弃他们优闲的假期生活，走出学校为人民服务：华东的学生在雨雪滂沱中参加修治淮河的工作；华北的学生在烈日炎炎下帮助农民捕虫抗旱；北京的学生们远赴内蒙古草原和山东、苏北，为当地农牧民防治疾病。
    随着爱国主义教育的普及和深入，许多长期蒙受帝国主义者欺骗、压制的教会学校师生也觉醒了。他们毅然地割断了与帝国主义的联系。有的还坚决地控诉、检举了潜伏在学校里的帝国主义分子。湖南长沙湘雅医学院有一个学生，是基督教徒，过去羡慕“英美士绅”的神气，吃的穿的全是舶来品，一九四六年在上海曾和美军共同坐过一次吉普车，他在很长的时间内还认为这是无上的光荣。抗美援朝运动使他改变了亲美崇美的思想，爱国主义思想教育使他看到伟大祖国光辉灿烂的前途，并下决心努力参加三自革新运动。曾经受过美国津贴四十八年的广州岭南大学的副校长说，“过去是面向美国，现在是面向北京”了。
    一年来，我国各级学校中的爱国主义教育已经有了一个良好的开端，但缺点还是严重的。许多学校和教师还没有重视爱国主义教育，不少教师还在以自己的错误观点进行教学。我们的教师应该在爱国主义的大旗下加紧自己的学习，改造自己的思想，继续加强我们学校教育中爱国主义的内容。（附图片）
