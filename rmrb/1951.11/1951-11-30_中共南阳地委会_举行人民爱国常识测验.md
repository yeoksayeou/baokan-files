    CCP Nanyang Prefectural Committee
    Holds People's Patriotic Common Sense Test
    The Nanyang Prefecture in Henan Province conducted a People's Patriotic Common Sense Test, which powerfully promoted the in-depth development of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement in the area.
    In the past, the Nanyang Prefecture had achieved some success in the propaganda of resisting America, aiding Korea, and protecting the homeland. However, in the past, most of the propaganda was only carried out from top to bottom; many township and village cadres were only satisfied with formalism in their propaganda, so the propaganda was not widespread and in-depth enough. In order to implement patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea, the CCP Nanyang Prefectural Committee conducted a typical experiment of the People's Patriotic Common Sense Test in Changzhuang Township, Nanyang County, and since mid-September, combined with the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting movements in the area, universally promoted the method of the People's Patriotic Common Sense Test.
    When holding the "People's Patriotic Common Sense Test," various places first conducted extensive patriotic propaganda and education. Reporters from the CCP Nanyang Prefectural Committee and county-level directly affiliated organs gave reports on current political affairs to cadres and the masses; each county also held propaganda worker meetings, expanded meetings of township cadres, and farmer representative meetings at the district level to convey the reporters' reports. After the meetings, cadres, propagandists, and farmer representatives adopted the "contract system" of division of labor for propaganda, respectively convening village meetings, group meetings, and using propaganda tools such as loudspeakers and blackboards to carry out propaganda to the masses. Then, the CCP Nanyang Prefectural Committee and the Nanyang Prefectural Resist America, Aid Korea Branch jointly proposed five test questions. After the questions were announced and the significance of the test was explained, the masses were mobilized to have full discussions, and finally a general examination or spot check was conducted.
    After the test questions were announced, a wave of learning quickly formed in various townships and villages. At the village entrance, in the threshing ground, on the road, in the fields, at the smoking pits, and at the meal gatherings, people were discussing and studying the test questions everywhere. In order to ensure that everyone received education, each village also convened meetings of household heads, mobilizing them to go back and conduct discussions in family meetings, so that men, women, old, and young in each household also participated in the discussions. An old woman in Yingzhuang Township, Nanyang County, went to the women's federation director four times in one night to study the questions and explain the questions to other women. Some people reviewed the idea of wanting to "change shifts and rest" among grassroots cadres after the land reform, who were not actively working, in the discussion. The test results in various places were generally very good. In Yingzhuang Township, Nanyang County, among the 100 farmers who were spot-checked, more than 50 people scored 80 or above, and only 5 people failed.
    This patriotic common sense test made the patriotic education in the whole region more in-depth, thus powerfully promoting the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement in the region. After the test, farmers in 1,364 townships out of 1,435 townships in seven counties and one district in the region have revised or supplemented the patriotic pacts. From mid-September to the end of October, the amount of patriotic donations paid in the region increased from 4.5 billion yuan to more than 12.98 billion yuan. Due to the high enthusiasm of the masses for learning, reading groups have also developed greatly. In October, the circulation of various newspapers in the region increased by more than 3,000 copies. In the discussion of the test questions, the farmers generally realized the benefits of being organized, so they joined mutual aid groups one after another. The mutual aid groups in the region also formulated winter production increase plans, launched challenge competitions, and launched the winter patriotic production movement. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中共南阳地委会
    举行人民爱国常识测验
    河南省南阳专区进行人民爱国常识测验，有力地推动了该区抗美援朝运动的深入发展。
    南阳专区过去在抗美援朝保家卫国的宣传中，有了不少成绩。但过去大多只作了自上而下的宣传；不少乡、村干部在宣传中只满足于形式主义的做法，因此宣传不够普遍和深入。中共南阳地委会为贯彻进行抗美援朝爱国主义教育，在南阳县常庄乡进行了人民爱国常识测验的典型试验，并自九月中旬起，结合该专区秋收、秋耕、秋种运动普遍推广人民爱国常识测验的办法。
    各地在举行“人民爱国常识测验”时，首先进行了广泛的爱国主义宣传教育。中共南阳地委和县级直属机关的报告员向干部、群众作有关时事政治的报告；各县又以区为单位召开宣传员会议、乡干部扩大会议和农民代表会议，传达报告员的报告。会后由干部、宣传员和农民代表采取“包干制”的分工宣传的办法，分别召开村民会、小组会并运用了广播筒、黑板报等宣传工具向群众进行宣传。然后中共南阳地委会和南阳专区抗美援朝分会共同提出五个测验题目。各地把题目公布并说明测验的意义后，发动群众作充分地讨论，最后进行普遍考试或抽考。
    测验题目公布后，各乡各村很快地形成了学习热潮。村头、场院、路上、田里、烟坑上、饭场里到处都有人在讨论研究测验题目。为了使人人受到教育，各村又召开了户长会，动员户长回去在家庭会上进行讨论，这样使各户男女老幼也参加了讨论。南阳县英庄乡一个老太婆一个晚上就曾四次找妇联主任研究问题，并向其他妇女解释问题。有的人在讨论中检讨了土地改革后基层干部中想“换班歇工”不积极工作的思想。各地测验的成绩一般都很好，南阳县英庄乡抽考的一百个农民中，八十分以上的就有五十多人，不及格的只有五人。
    这次爱国常识测验使全专区爱国主义教育更深入了一步，因而有力地推动了该专区的抗美援朝运动。该专区七个县一个区的一千四百三十五个乡在测验后已有一千三百六十四个乡的农民修订或补订了爱国公约。全专区自九月中旬至十月底止，爱国捐献缴款数从四十五亿元增加到一百二十九亿八千多万元。由于群众学习情绪高涨，读报组也有很大发展，全专区十月份各种报纸的发行数增加了三千多份。农民在测验题目的讨论中普遍认识到组织起来的好处，于是纷纷参加互助组。全专区的互助组并先后制订了冬季增产计划，发起挑战竞赛，展开了冬季爱国生产运动。（新华社）
