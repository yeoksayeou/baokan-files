    Leadership Style Transformation at Northeast Egg Products Company Spurs Progress in Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign
    To the Editor: Because the leadership of the Northeast Regional Company of the China Egg Products Company suffered from bureaucracy in the past and showed indifference to state property, the workers were not very enthusiastic about production when the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign began. For example, Zhang Shenxiang, the deputy manager of the company, transferred staff members arbitrarily and based on personal feelings. The staff was very dissatisfied with this. When they criticized him in the newspaper, Zhang not only refused to accept the criticism but also suppressed it and questioned the "motives" of the writer. In May and June of last year, Zhang Shenxiang, with the approval of the company's manager Gao Kaiping, sold two machines for cutting cow heads (said to be the only two in Northeast China) and one wool machine (for washing wool and tanning sheepskins) from the company's Livestock Products Processing Factory as scrap iron. When worker Wang Tingke saw this, he felt very sorry and immediately went to Manager Gao and said, "The machines can still be used, why are you breaking them up?" Gao said, "If they can still be used, then don't sell them!" But when Wang Tingke returned to the site, the machines had already been completely broken up. The workers were very dissatisfied with this. This affected the development of the conservation movement. Some workers said, "What we increase in production and save is not enough for the leadership to waste!"
    Based on this situation, the company's General Party Branch Committee convened an enlarged meeting of party members, inviting the participation of the masses. At the meeting, everyone was called upon to actively offer criticisms and suggestions to the leadership. The company's manager made a self-criticism at the meeting about his past bureaucratic style. After the meeting, the workers' ideological concerns were eliminated, and their work enthusiasm was greatly improved, thus enabling the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign to develop. The company's Livestock Products Processing Factory initially set a plan to increase production by 3,500 tons of grain when the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign began, but now it has increased to more than 7,000 tons, and has completed 70% of the entire increased production task. I think that correcting bureaucratic work styles of the leading cadres is key to carrying out the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign and giving full play to the enthusiasm of the masses.　Zhou Ruiwu

### 东北蛋品公司领导作风转变  使增产节约运动有了起色

    东北蛋品公司领导作风转变
    使增产节约运动有了起色
    编辑同志：中国蛋品公司东北区公司由于过去领导上存在着官僚主义，对国家财产漠不关心，因此，在这次增产节约运动开始时，工人群众的生产热情不高。如该公司副经理张甚祥因个人意气，无原则地调动工作人员，职工对此很不满意，在报上提出批评，张不但不接受，反而压制批评，追问写稿人的“动机”。去年五、六月间张甚祥将该公司所属畜产加工厂的两台切牛头的机器（据说东北仅有此两台）和一台羊毛机（洗羊毛、熟羊皮用的）打成碎铁卖掉（经该公司经理高楷平批准）。工友王廷科当时看见非常心疼，就马上找高经理说：“机器还能用，为什么打碎呢？”高说：“要还能用，就不卖吧！”但王廷科再返回现场时，机器已被全部打碎了。工人们对此十分不满。这样，影响了这次节约运动的开展。有的工人说：“我们增产节约的还不够给领导上浪费的！”
    该公司中共总支委员会根据这一情况，召开了党员扩大会议，吸收群众参加。会上号召大家积极向领导方面提出批评和建议。该公司经理在会上检讨了自己过去的官僚主义作风。会后，工人群众的思想顾虑消除了，工作情绪大大提高，因而使增产节约运动得以开展。该公司所属畜产加工厂，在增产节约运动开始时只订了增产三千五百吨粮食的计划，现在则增加到七千多吨，并已完成全部增产任务的百分之七十。我觉得，领导干部纠正官僚主义作风，是开展增产节约运动，发挥群众积极性的关键。　周锐武
