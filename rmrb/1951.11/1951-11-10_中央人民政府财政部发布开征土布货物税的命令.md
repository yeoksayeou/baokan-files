    The Central People's Government Ministry of Finance Issues Order on Levying Tax on Homespun Cloth

    In order to appropriately balance the tax burden between machine-made cotton cloth and homespun cloth, with the approval of the Government Administration Council, a goods tax on homespun cloth will be levied starting November 1, 1951. From the same date, the homespun cloth transaction tax will be abolished. The collection of the homespun cloth goods tax shall be handled in accordance with the Provisional Regulations on Goods Tax and the Implementing Rules. The tax rate and collection procedures are now specified as follows:

    I. Scope and tax rate of the homespun cloth goods tax:
    	1. Cloth woven entirely with homespun yarn: tax rate of 8%.
    	2. Cloth woven with a mixture of machine-made yarn and homespun yarn: tax rate of 4%.

    II. The taxpayers for the homespun cloth goods tax are cooperatives, purchasers, firms, and large-scale weaving factories in local markets. They shall pay taxes to the local tax authorities in accordance with regulations. Self-woven cloth for self-use shall not be taxed.

    III. The minimum shipping quantity of homespun cloth is one bundle (approximately 50 *jin*). The unit of taxation and the minimum ex-factory quantity shall be determined by the provincial and municipal tax bureaus according to local market practices.

    IV. After the homespun cloth is taxed, the tax authority shall issue a tax certificate and stamp each piece of cloth at one end for inspection during transportation and sales.

    V. Taxed homespun cloth that is processed for dyeing or printing is exempt from alteration procedures. However, during dyeing or printing, the stamped area should be tied with rope to prevent coloring, so as to facilitate identification.

    VI. For homespun cloth stored in the market before the levy of the goods tax, those that have already paid the transaction tax can apply to the tax authority for a transportation and sales certificate based on the original transaction tax stamp, and are exempt from the supplementary goods tax. When processing for dyeing or printing, it shall be handled in accordance with item V, exempt from alteration procedures. Those that have not paid the transaction tax can pay the goods tax according to the new method when shipping.

    The aforementioned transportation and sales certificate shall be replaced by a shipping certificate, and stamped with "Transportation and Sales Certificate for Homespun Cloth with Transaction Tax Paid."

    为适当地平衡机制棉布与土布的税负，经呈奉政务院批准自一九五一年十一月一日起开征土布货物税。并于同日起停征土布交易税。土布货物税之稽征事宜，除依照货物税暂行条例及施行细则办理外，兹将税率及稽征手续规定如下：

    三、土布最低分运量为一捆（五十市斤左右），计税单位及最低出厂量由各省、市税务局按各地市场习惯自行规定。
    四、土布完税后，由税务机关填发完税照，并于每匹布的一端加盖验戳，以便运销查验。
