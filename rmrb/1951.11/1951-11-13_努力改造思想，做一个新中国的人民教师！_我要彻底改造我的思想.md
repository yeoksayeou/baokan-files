　　Strive to Remold Ideology and Become a People's Teacher in New China!
    I Want to Thoroughly Remold My Ideology
    Jiang Yin'en, Chairman of the Journalism Department of Yenching University
    After listening to Premier Zhou's report on the ideological remolding of intellectuals, I felt extremely ashamed. Since liberation, I have read many books on Marxism, Leninism, and Mao Zedong Thought, and have also participated in political classes at the university and studied with my classmates. I absorbed some new theories and my thinking improved a step further. At that time, I thought that with this little "capital," and with further "supplementation" later, there would probably be no problems in coping with the teaching job. The main reason I thought this way at the time was due to the following two ideas: one was a sense of complacency about my own learning, and the other was a narrow view of learning, seeing it merely as a way to cope with teaching. These two ideas undoubtedly played a considerable hindering role in my progress. In the past year, I have gradually realized the necessity of thoroughly remolding my ideology from practical work, so I have also more or less changed my past incorrect attitudes and views on learning; however, because my understanding is not comprehensive and profound enough, my progress has also been very limited. Since listening to Premier Zhou's kind and touching report, I have gained great inspiration. I realize that to be a true people's teacher today, it is impossible without thoroughly remolding my ideology. The so-called ideological remolding, first of all, requires a firm and uncompromising struggle against one's past old ideas; only after those incorrect and non-proletarian ideas have been criticized and cleared can a new ideological system be gradually established, can a proletarian stand be gradually firmly established, and can the goal of serving the people wholeheartedly be gradually realized. I deeply realize that if we, who are engaged in education, do not sincerely remold our ideology in today's rapidly advancing construction undertakings of the new China, the result will be that our education work will become "misleading our children," which is an irreparable loss to the country; and for ourselves, it is an unforgivable mistake.
    I was born into a petty-bourgeois family. My grandfather died when my father was sixteen years old. In order to shoulder the responsibility of supporting the family, my father gave up the opportunity to study and went to work as an apprentice in a store, and later started his own business. After twenty years, he finally built up a small business that allowed the family to be fed and clothed. When he recalled his difficult early years of building a business from scratch, he often told us brothers to study hard in order to be self-reliant. He wanted us to be clean and self-respecting, and even more to strive for advancement. He was engaged in commerce all his life, and he knew a lot about the old society where people's hearts were not what they used to be and the world was dangerous, so he often told us his principles of conduct, telling us to respect superiors and be kind to subordinates, and not to offend anyone. My class origin and my father's philosophy of life formed my serious individualism and the idea of climbing up. After leaving school and joining the journalism industry, what I thought about was how to become a famous reporter? How to become an editor-in-chief? In the past, although I disliked politics, if an opportunity to rise rapidly presented itself to me, I dare not say that I would be unmoved.
    I have been educated by American imperialist cultural aggression for a long time (ten years in middle school and university), so I yearn for American democracy and freedom. When I was studying in the Journalism Department of Yenching University, most of the teachers in the department were Americans and Chinese who only spoke English; all the courses were moved from the Journalism School of the University of Missouri in the United States. I received four years of such journalism education at Yenching, and as a result, my mind was filled with things like this: American journalism is the most developed in the world; American news is the freest; American newspapers are the best. Therefore, after joining the journalism industry, I believed that if China's journalism industry was to develop, it must "take the United States as its teacher" and completely move over the American way of running newspapers. Especially the American-style freedom of the press, which fascinated me the most. At that time, I felt that the Soviet Union had no freedom of the press at all; true freedom of the press only existed in the United States. There was also no freedom of the press in the liberated areas. The Kuomintang reactionary government, except for political news, other news was free. This wrong view was of course due to my lack of understanding of the essential differences between the Soviet Union and the United States, between the people's regime and the reactionary regime; but more importantly, it was due to my class origin, which often led me to look at problems from the standpoint of the reactionary class.
    Due to the bourgeois education I received in the past, not only did I not know how to understand problems from their essence, but I also had very serious ideas of being above politics and above class. My view of domestic politics at that time was like this: the Kuomintang reactionary ruling clique, headed by the four big families, was corrupt and made a mess of China, which was hateful; but regarding the Communist Party far away in Yan'an, although I heard some scattered facts about their political integrity and hard living, I also heard many complete stories of killing, arson, and bloody struggles, so I held a skeptical and estranged attitude towards the Communist Party. Due to the existence of this kind of thinking, I felt that I should be detached in politics, and should be impartial; my view of problems should be neutral, and I should not speak from any position. In this regard, I did my best, and even took pride in being able to be "neutral." In fact, was I really detached from politics in the past? Was my view of problems really neutral? Today, my answer is definitely the opposite.
    Regarding the issue of standpoint, I didn't understand it at all before liberation. Before liberation, I thought I had no standpoint, and I hated it when others said I had a standpoint. When I joined the journalism industry, my view of newspapers was like this: newspapers should be free, neutral, and detached. Newspapers should take an impartial attitude on political issues. If Party A has good things, the newspaper should praise it, and if it has bad things, the newspaper should criticize it; if Party B has good things, the newspaper should praise it in the same way, and if it has bad things, the newspaper should criticize it in the same way. I felt that newspapers must do this in order for freedom of speech to exist and for the attitude to be fair. At the same time, I believed that newspapers should not be directly related to politics. The further away newspapers were from politics, the better; otherwise, it would not be easy for newspapers to maintain their neutral and detached position. When I was in charge of the Journalism Department of Yenching University in Chengdu, I published a four-page, six-column Chinese-English internship weekly, "Yenching News," which specifically reported domestic student movement news. At that time, there were two groups of students with different ideas in the department, and the struggle was very fierce. In order to show "fairness," the editorial staff was elected by the students themselves every year. At that time, there were more students with progressive ideas, so they often controlled the editing and writing power of "Yenching News." Those reactionary party group students often questioned me about "content issues" under the pretext of "content issues." My approach at the time was to mediate between the two sides, without definitively saying which side was wrong. At that time, I thought that by not actively supporting progressive students, but rather compromising with reactionary elements, I was being detached and neutral; in fact, wasn't I already losing my basic people's standpoint?
    I worked in journalism for seven years in the past (except for one year at the Shanghai Great American Daily, the other six years were at Ta Kung Pao), editing newspapers and writing editorials. At that time, I thought my attitude was detached and neutral, but in reality, I stood with the reactionary ruling class. Recently, during a group discussion on the issue of standpoint in Premier Zhou's report, I raised the following example (there are many other examples) to criticize my own thinking.
    When the Pacific War broke out and the situation in Hong Kong and Kowloon was very critical, the planes of the Kuomintang reactionary government abandoned the passengers who were scrambling to get on board and rushed to transport the luggage and beloved dogs of the Kong family, one of the four big families, to Chongqing. At that time, this "airplane carrying dogs" incident aroused dissatisfaction among the broad masses of people in the rear area. Students in Kunming took the lead in launching a campaign to overthrow Kong, which was very powerful; students in other places also rose up in response. At that time, I had no good feelings for the four big families, and I especially expressed resentment towards the "airplane carrying dogs" incident, so I sympathized with the student movement at that time; but the editorial I wrote for the Ta Kung Pao in Guilin on this matter advised young students not to "use any means or go beyond the bounds;" and hoped that they would "first strengthen themselves, enrich themselves, and make themselves capable of becoming figures who can shift the situation and open up the fate of the country, and then rely on their own efforts to make politics new and the country healthy." I wrote this at the time, thinking that it was out of sincere care for young students, and hoping that they would not suffer unexpected losses due to "temporary emotional impulses;" but I absolutely did not think at the time that my article just helped the Kuomintang reactionary ruling clique at that time, because the Kuomintang reactionary ruling clique was using various means to suppress the student movement, fearing that the student movement would expand; and my article was precisely to tell young students to bury themselves in studying and not to ask about politics. Today, I re-read this editorial and carefully analyze why I sympathized with the student movement, but wrote an article that was harmful to the student movement? Looking back today, although I sympathized with the student movement emotionally when I wrote this article, my standpoint was not on the side of the revolution, so what I said would not have a revolutionary standpoint, nor would it have a middle-of-the-road standpoint, and the result would inevitably fall to the side of the reactionary ruling class.
    In 1942, I returned to Yenching to head the Journalism Department. Due to my past relationship with the journalism industry, although I left the journalism job, I was still occasionally asked to write articles for newspapers, including the pseudo-Chengdu Central Daily at that time and the later pseudo-North China Daily. Although I avoided talking about domestic political issues when writing articles for the pseudo-newspapers at that time, and wrote more articles on international issues, thinking about it today, my standpoint at that time was very problematic. Although I can defend myself by saying that I had to be perfunctory at the time due to face (I was very familiar with Zhang Mingwei, the president of the pseudo-Chengdu Central Daily and the pseudo-North China Daily); or that I had to deal with people like Zhang Mingwei for the sake of the Yenching Journalism Department; but it can be asserted that I would never stand on the people's side when writing articles for reactionary newspapers, and I harmed the interests of the people.
    Until the eve of the liberation of Beijing, I was still teaching my students with American bourgeois journalism theory, and explaining to the students that the so-called American freedom of the press was the best system in the world. At that time, I did not think it was wrong to do so. In the autumn of 1948, I went to the United States, and after actual observation and research (I happened to catch up with the US election), I gradually realized the true face of American pseudo-democracy and false freedom, and thus began to doubt American bourgeois journalism theory. After returning to China in the autumn of 1949, I gradually realized my past wrong ideas in learning, and hoped to remold them. In the past, I have written articles criticizing my own thinking, but the criticism was not profound enough, and I did not find the root of the wrong thinking. After listening to Premier Zhou's report this time, first of all, I realized the importance of the issue of standpoint, and I also carefully analyzed my past standpoint, and only then did I more clearly realize that my past self-proclaimed detached and neutral standpoint was actually in the same breath as the reactionary ruling class at that time.
    After liberation, although I participated in various studies at the university, the old baggage in my thinking has not been completely removed, and my standpoint is also very vague. Thanks to the enlightenment and encouragement of Premier Zhou's report, I am determined to thoroughly criticize my old ideas in this guided and systematic study, correctly establish the people's and even the working class's standpoint, and transform myself into a people's teacher in the true sense of the word.

　　努力改造思想，做一个新中国的人民教师！
    我要彻底改造我的思想
    燕京大学新闻系主任  蒋荫恩
    听了周总理关于知识分子思想改造问题的报告，感到万分的惭愧。解放以来，我看了不少马克思、列宁主义以及毛泽东思想的书，也参加过校内的政治课，和同学们一起学习，新理论吸收了一些，思想也提高了一步，当时就以为有了这一点“本钱”，以后再继续“补充”，对于应付教书这件工作大概不致有问题。当时所以这样想，主要由于下面两种思想：一是对于自己的学习有了自满的心理，一是把学习狭义地看作只是为了应付教书。这两种思想，对于我的进步无疑是起了相当的阻碍作用的。最近一年来，我从实际工作中逐渐认识到彻底改造思想的必要，因此也或多或少地改变过去对学习的不正确态度和看法；可是由于认识还不够全面和深刻，因而进步也是很有限的。自从听了周总理亲切、感人的报告以后，我获得了极大的启发。我认识到今天要做一个真正的人民教师，不彻底改造自己的思想是不行的。所谓思想改造，首先要对自己过去的旧思想进行坚决而不妥协的斗争；把那些不正确的、非无产阶级的思想批判了、清算了以后，才能逐渐建立起新的思想体系，才能逐渐站稳了无产阶级的立场，才能逐渐实现全心全意为人民服务的目的。我深深地认识到：我们从事教育工作的人，在新中国一切建设事业突飞猛进的今天，如果还不诚心诚意来改造我们的思想，结果我们的教育工作就会变成“误人子弟”的工作，这对国家来说，是一种不可补偿的损失；对自己来说，更是不可宽恕的错误行为。
    我出身于小资产阶级的家庭。父亲十六岁的时候，祖父就死了。为了负起赡养家庭的责任，父亲就放弃读书的机会，进了店里学生意，以后就自己经商。经过二十年的时光，他终于撑起了一份小小的产业，使家庭可以温饱。当他回忆他年青时白手成家的艰苦情形，就常常告诉我们弟兄要发奋读书，以求自立。他要我们洁身自好，更要我们力图上进。他终身从事商业，那些人心不古、世途险恶的旧社会情形，他知道的很多，因此他常常把自己立身处世之道讲给我们听，要我们敬上厚下，与人无侮。我的阶级出身以及我父亲这套人生哲学，就形成我严重的个人主义和往上爬的思想。出了学校，参加新闻工作以后，脑子里所想的，是怎样才能做一个名记者？怎样才能当一个总编辑？过去我虽然厌恶政治，可是如果有一个飞黄腾达的机会放在我面前，我不敢说我会无动于中的。
    我长期受美帝国主义文化侵略教育（中学、大学共十年），因此对于美国的民主和自由是心向往之的。在燕京新闻学系读书的时候，当时系里的教员大半是美国人和只说英文的中国人；所有课程，都是由美国密苏里大学新闻学院搬过来的。我在燕京受了四年这样的新闻教育，结果我的脑子里装满了这样的东西：美国新闻事业是世界上最发达的；美国新闻是最自由的；美国报纸是最好的。因此我参加新闻工作以后，就认为中国新闻事业要发达，必须“以美为师”，把美国人办报的那一套完全搬过来。尤其美国式的新闻自由，最使我心醉。当时我觉得：苏联是根本没有新闻自由的；真正的新闻自由，只有美国才有。解放区也是没有新闻自由的。国民党反动政府，除掉政治性的新闻以外，其他新闻是自由的。这种错误的看法，固然由于我不知道从本质上来认识苏联和美国、人民政权和反动政权的区别；但更其重要的，则是由于我的阶级出身关系，往往是站在反动阶级的立场来看问题的。
    由于我过去所受的资产阶级教育，不但不知道从本质上去认识问题，而且还存在着很严重的超政治、超阶级思想。我当时对国内政治的看法是这样：以四大家族为首的国民党反动统治集团，贪污腐败，把中国弄得一团糟，是令人痛恨的；但对远在延安的共产党，虽然听到一些政治上廉洁、生活上刻苦的零星事实，同时也听到不少杀人放火、流血斗争的成套故事，因此对共产党是抱着怀疑和疏远的态度的。由于存在着这种思想，我觉得我在政治上应该超然，应该不偏不倚；对问题的看法应该中立，应该不站在任何立场说话。我在这方面，的确尽了最大的努力，而且还沾沾以自己能够“中立”为喜。其实，过去我对政治是不是真的超然了呢？我对问题的看法是不是真的中立了呢？今天我的答案肯定是反面的。
    关于立场问题，解放前我是完全不了解的。解放前，我自以为没有立场，而且很痛恨别人说我有立场。我参加新闻工作的时候，对报纸的看法是这样：报纸应该是自由的，中立的，超然的。报纸在政治问题上应该采取不偏不倚的态度。甲党有好的地方报纸应该赞扬它，有坏的地方报纸应该批评它；乙党有好的地方报纸应该同样赞扬它，有坏的地方报纸应该同样批评它。我觉得报纸必须如此，言论才算得上自由，态度才算得上公正。同时我认为报纸不应该和政治直接发生关系。报纸应该离开政治愈远愈好；否则，报纸就不易维持它的中立和超然的地位。我在成都燕京主持新闻学系的时候，曾出版一个四开六版的中英文实习周刊《燕京新闻》，专门报道国内学运消息。当时系里有两种思想不同的学生，斗争得很厉害。我为了表示“公正”起见，编辑部人员每年由同学自己选举。当时思想进步的同学人数较多，所以常常掌握《燕京新闻》的编采实权。那些反动党团的学生借口“内容问题”，常常向我提出质问。我当时的处理方法是两面劝解，不肯定说出那一方面不对。当时我自以为不帮助任何一方面说话，我的态度就是超然、中立；其实，我不积极支持进步学生，反而和反动分子妥协，今天回想起来，不是已经丧失我的起码的人民立场了吗？
    过去我做过七年新闻工作“除掉一年在上海大美早报，其他六年都在大公报），编过报，也写过社论。当时我自以为我的态度是超然、中立，而实际却和反动统治阶级站在一个立场。最近在小组会上讨论周总理报告中的立场问题时，我曾经提出下面这样一个例子（其他的例子多得很），来批判我自己的思想。
    在太平洋战事爆发，港九形势十分危急的时候，国民党反动政府的飞机，曾扔下争先恐后的乘客，把四大家族之一的孔家的箱笼和爱犬等抢运到重庆。当时这个“飞机带狗”事件曾引起大后方广大人民的不满。昆明学生首先发动倒孔运动，声势很盛；其他各地学生，也纷纷起来响应。我当时对于四大家族是没有好感的，对于“飞机带狗”这件事尤其表示愤恨，因此很同情当时的学生运动；但是我为了这件事在桂林大公报上所写的社论，却劝告青年学生不要“不择手段，逾越常轨；”并且希望他们“先坚强自己，充实自己，使自己能成为转移时势开拓国运的人物，然后再凭自己的努力，使政治新生，国家健存。”我当时这样写，自以为出于爱护青年学生的至诚，并且希望他们不致由于“一时的感情冲动”而遭受意外的损失；可是我当时绝对没有想到，我这篇文章，恰恰帮了当时国民党反动统治集团的忙，因为当时国民党反动统治集团正使用种种手段来压制学运，唯恐学运扩大；而我这篇文章正是要青年学生埋头读书，不问政治。今天我重读这篇社评，仔细分析为什么我同情学运，而又写出有害学运的文章？今天回想起来，我当时写这篇文章的时候，虽然情感上同情学运，但是我的立场并没有站在革命的一方面，因此我所说的话，固然不会有革命立场，也不会有中间立场，结果就必然倒向反动统治阶级的立场方面去了。
    一九四二年我回到燕京主持新闻系。由于我过去和新闻界的关系，我虽然离开了新闻工作岗位，可是还不时被约替报纸写文章，其中包括当时的伪成都中央日报和以后的伪华北日报。我当时替伪报写文章，虽然避免谈国内政治问题，多写国际问题的文章，但是今天想起来，当时我的立场是很成问题的。虽然我可以替自己辩护，说我当时碍于情面（我和伪成都中央日报及伪华北日报社长张明炜很熟识），不得不敷衍一下；或者说为了燕京新闻系的关系，不得不和张明炜这种人物周旋；但是我替反动报纸写文章，绝不会站在人民的立场说话，并且损害了人民的利益，这是可以断言的。
    直到北京解放前夕，我还是用美国资产阶级的新闻理论教我的学生，并且把美国式的所谓新闻自由当作世界上最好的制度向学生讲解。当时我不觉得这样做是错误。一九四八年秋我去美国，经过实际的观察和研究（正赶上美国大选），我才逐渐认识美国伪民主和假自由的真面目，因而对于美国资产阶级的新闻理论起了怀疑。一九四九年秋回国后，在学习中逐渐认识自己过去的错误思想，希望加以改造。过去我曾经写文章批判过我的思想，但是批判得不够深刻，也没有找到错误思想的根源。这次听了周总理的报告，首先我认识了立场问题的重要，也仔细分析了我过去的立场，才更清楚地认识到过去我自以为是超然、中立的立场，实际是和当时反动统治阶级的立场一个鼻孔出气的。
    解放以后，我虽然参加了校内的各种学习，可是我思想上的旧包袱还没有完全去掉，立场也是很模糊的。由于周总理报告对我的启发和鼓励，我决心在这次有领导有系统的学习中，彻底批判我的旧思想，正确建立人民的以至工人阶级的立场，把我自己改造为名副其实的人民教师。
                                        一九五一年十月二十九日
