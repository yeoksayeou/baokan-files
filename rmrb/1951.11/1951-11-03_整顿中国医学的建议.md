    Suggestions for Rectifying Chinese Medicine
    Wang Yimen
    I am nearly sixty years old and have practiced traditional Chinese medicine for over twenty years, but my medical thinking is not rigid, and I advocate reform. Under the inspiration of our great leader Chairman Mao's spirit of "serving the people," I have become even more determined to improve and develop my medical skills.
    Traditional Chinese medicine has a long history, its principles and methods are excellent, its efficacy is real, and it has won the trust of the broad masses of people. This is common knowledge. However, in the past half-century, the development of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine has been extremely disparate. Western medicine is scientific, and its great development in China, especially in the last hundred years, goes without saying. Traditional Chinese medicine, on the other hand, has increasingly been in a state of stagnation, causing the will of practitioners and the perception of society to become increasingly depressed and low.
    Now that our great motherland has stood up, the academic prospects of traditional Chinese medicine and the future of practitioners have even more infinite hope. We should redouble our efforts to thoroughly reorganize and reform the academic study of traditional Chinese medicine.
    Currently, only our country has both Chinese and Western medical techniques. This is very rare. The basic theories of the two are different, and the treatment methods are different, but the purpose is to treat people's illnesses. They should not run in opposite directions but should advance together and ultimately merge into one. Based on this goal, I suggest that work be carried out in three steps: first, equal development; second, mutual criticism to discard shortcomings; and third, mutual learning of strengths for joint development. The true meaning of the first step is to not exclude each other, to be equal to each other, and to summarize one's own academic knowledge and its effectiveness. The second step is for both sides to establish hospitals and, based on clinical treatment examples, to mutually discover and overcome shortcomings. The third step is to discard shortcomings, retain strengths, and combine them into a new Chinese medicine.
    Traditional Chinese medicine has basic theories. Each department has principles of disease, syndrome differentiation has analytical clauses, treatment methods have superficial and fundamental remedies, along with acupuncture, massage, etc. These are simple and economical, often with surprisingly rapid effects, and are widely welcomed by the working class, peasants, and laborers. For the needs of the people and the development of academic study, we should be humble and not discouraged, strive for progress, and never lag behind. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly establish institutions to engage in reorganization.
    Although traditional Chinese medicine has a long history and rich experience, it lacks scientific organization. Therefore, we should strive for reform and move towards science. It is true that the levels of traditional Chinese medicine doctors are uneven, but may I ask, since there is not even a teaching institution, who will take care of training? How can the levels be uniform? Such a long-term state of disorganization, lack of systems, lack of institutions, lack of support, and scattering makes reform impossible. It is also true that traditional Chinese medicine is difficult to learn and teach, treating all kinds of diseases, and the division of labor is unclear. Lack of specialization hinders expertise, which is an important reason for the stagnation of academic progress. Therefore, reforming and reorganizing traditional Chinese medicine is even more important.
    How can we better reorganize traditional Chinese medicine? I suggest: (1) Accelerate the reorganization of traditional Chinese medicine academic studies; (2) Expand the establishment of traditional Chinese medicine research institutes; (3) Establish traditional Chinese medicine hospitals when conditions permit. The latter two items require the formulation of specific measures and will not be described in detail for now. Now I will only talk about the three key points in reorganizing traditional Chinese medicine academic studies: First, unify theory. There are many schools of traditional Chinese medicine, each relying on its own techniques and not valuing basic principles. Therefore, unifying theory is the only crucial task. Diagnostic outlines and treatment methods should be reorganized according to a scientific system. Second, conduct research by department. The method of research is to require each person to specialize. The finer the division of departments, the more precise the research results, and the faster the progress. Third, engage in writing in a planned way. The original old medical books are rarely suitable for current needs. The style and structure of the writings need to be carefully planned to be practical, so that they can be used as teaching materials and also for clinical reference. The writing plan must be meticulous, and the selection of materials must be cautious.
    I hope that those who care about traditional Chinese medicine academic studies and the administrative departments of medicine and health will consider and adopt these suggestions. I believe that in the new China, as long as traditional Chinese medicine is reformed and reorganized under the leadership of the Central People's Government, it will have a future for development. The two major medical techniques, Chinese and Western, that coexist at present will eventually converge and will surely make a new and common contribution to the broad masses of people.

    整顿中国医学的建议
    王易门
    我是近六十岁的人了，从业中医已有二十余年，但我的医学思想是不固执的，是主张革新的。在我国人民伟大的领袖毛主席“为人民服务”的精神感召之下，我益加坚定了改进与发展医术的心愿。
    中医是有它悠久的历史的，其理法优长，效能真实，且取得了广大人民的信赖，这是人所共知的。但自近半世纪以来，中医与西医发展极为悬殊。西医是科学的，尤以近百年来在中国有很大的发展是不用细说的。中医则日益处于有退无进的瘫痪状态，致使从业者的意志和社会大众的观感也日益消沉与低落。
    现在我伟大祖国站起来了，中医的学术和从业者的前途更有了无穷的希望，我们更应加倍努力彻底整理和革新中医的学术。
    现在世界上只有我国有中西两种医术，这是很难得的。两者基本理论不同，治疗方法不一，但目的都是为人治病，不应背道而驰，而应共同前进，最后合而为一。本此目的，我建议按三个步骤进行工作：一是平等发展；二是互相攻错各舍其短；三是互取所长合力发展。第一步的真意就是互不排挤，彼此平等，各把自己的学术及其效能作个总结。第二步是使双方各设医院，依据临床治疗实例，互相发现与克服缺点。第三步则彼此舍去缺点，保留长处，合为新的中国医学。
    中医是有基本理论的。各科有病症原理，辨症有分析条款，治法有标本正方，连同针灸推按等等，简单经济，往往效果奇速，普遍为工农劳动人民所欢迎。我们为了人民的需要和学术的发展，应谦逊而不自馁，力求进步决不后人，因此须迅速设立机构，从事整理。
    中医虽有悠久的历史和丰富的经验，但缺乏科学的整理，故应力求革新，走向科学化。中医医师程度不齐确是事实；但试问连教学的机构都还没有，谁去管训练？程度何由得齐？这样无组织、无系统、无机构、毫无依附，长期散乱，就不能革新。中医难学难教，百科兼治，分工不明，这也是事实。业不专不能精，这是学术停滞不进的一个重要原因。所以革新整理中医就更为重要。
    如何使中医进行较好的整理呢？我建议：（一）加紧整理中医学术；（二）扩大设立中医研究院；（三）在条件允许时设立中医医院。后两项需要拟定具体办法暂不详述，现在只说在整理中医学术方面应有三个要点：第一、统一理论。中医宗派很多，各凭方技，不重视基本原理，所以统一理论，是唯一切要的工作。诊断大纲、治疗方法，都要按科学系统加以整理。第二、分科研究。研究的办法是每人要求专门化。这样分科越细，研究的结果越精，进步的速度越快。第三、有计划地从事著作。原有的旧医书，是很少适合目前需要的。著作的体例条理需要切实计划，合于实用，使之可以作教学资料，也可供临床备考。著作计划务求周密，选定资料务求审慎。
    上述意见，希望关心中医学术的人和医药卫生的行政部门加以考虑，采择施行。我相信在新中国，中医只要在中央人民政府领导下加以革新和整理，必有发展的前途。现时并立存在的中西两大医术，将来终必汇合，对广大人民必能有共同的新贡献。
