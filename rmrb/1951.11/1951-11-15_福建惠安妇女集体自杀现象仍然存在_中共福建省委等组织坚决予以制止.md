　　Collective Suicide of Women Still Exists in Huian, Fujian
　　The CPC Fujian Provincial Committee and Other Organizations Resolutely Stop It

    The CPC Fujian Provincial Committee, the Fujian Provincial Democratic Women's Federation, the CPC Huian County Committee, and the Huian County Democratic Women's Federation are taking various effective measures to resolutely eliminate the phenomenon of collective suicide by women in Huian County due to marriage problems.

    Historically, Huian County, Fujian Province, has had a prevailing trend of collective suicide among women. Although this is a special situation nationwide, it is a very serious phenomenon. Under the evil rule of the Kuomintang government, according to statistics from the Third District of the county, an average of one woman committed suicide every day. This is an alarming number. This situation has been developing continuously. After liberation, although the phenomenon of collective suicide among women has decreased, it has not been eliminated.

    In June of this year, a collective suicide incident involving three female cadres occurred in Shangcun Village, Eleventh District of Huian County. These three female cadres were Chen Mianhua, a member of the township farmers' association, Chen Mei'ou, a representative of the township women, and Chen Suiniang, a leader of the township farmers' association group. All three were young and active in their work, and had a high reputation among the masses. However, they were often troubled because their marital problems could not be resolved reasonably. Chen Mianhua married at the age of sixteen and is now twenty-four years old, and her relationship with her husband has always been bad. Although Chen Mei'ou and Chen Suiniang had good relationships with their husbands after marriage, they could not freely be with their husbands due to the restrictions of the feudal marriage system. On the evening of June 2nd this year, Chen Mianhua and others, after participating in a play, agreed to put on beautiful clothes and commit suicide by jumping into the water together.

    This collective suicide case had a very bad impact on the masses. After their deaths, some women in nearby townships said: "If they, who are so capable, still have to die, when will I ever get through this!" So they also wanted to commit suicide. According to preliminary investigations, as many as sixty or seventy women wanted to commit suicide at that time.

    The main reason for the collective suicide of women is dissatisfaction with the feudal marriage system. There is a custom in the Huian area: after a woman gets married, she can only live in her husband's home for the first three days, and after that, she can only return to her husband's home for a few days during the New Year and holidays. In some areas, women have to cover their faces with a cloth when they return to their husband's home, and can only remove it after the lights are turned off at night. They have to run back to their parents' home before dawn the next day. In this way, many couples, although married for several years, do not even know each other. At the same time, there is a serious phenomenon of early marriage in Huian County. Girls as young as twelve or thirteen have to get married. Of course, there will be no affection between such couples. Therefore, women use death to resist this barbaric marriage system. Every year during the "Pudu" season (July), collective suicide incidents occur everywhere.

    After liberation, especially after the three major movements of Resisting America and Aiding Korea, Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries, and Land Reform, the awareness of the masses has generally increased, and the political and economic status of women has also increased accordingly. However, due to the deeply rooted feudal marriage system, the local party organizations and the people's government have not paid enough attention to solving the special suffering of women, and have not seriously organized forces to completely destroy the barbaric marriage system, so that women's suicide incidents continue to occur two years after liberation. According to incomplete statistics, from October 1949 to August 1950, 122 women committed suicide in Huian.

    After the incident of the collective suicide of Chen Mianhua and the other two cadres, the local CPC Eleventh District Committee immediately convened a meeting of cadres from various townships to discuss ways to curb this trend of collective suicide. After hearing the news, the CPC Fujian Provincial Committee and the Fujian Provincial Democratic Women's Federation also sent cadres to form a working group with the CPC Huian County Committee and the County Democratic Women's Federation to assist the Eleventh District Committee in solving this problem. The Eleventh District Committee and the working group then convened district and township cadre meetings, militia conferences, Communist Youth League member meetings, and women's representative meetings to explain the Marriage Law to everyone, emphasizing that under the constraints of the feudal marriage system and feudal malpractices, both men and women are suffering, and women are even more painful, and women's suicide is entirely forced by the feudal marriage system. At these meetings, many female cadres complained. At the same time, they made self-criticism of their past passive suicidal thoughts. Male cadres also reviewed their views of belittling women, and criticized the wrong ideas such as "What does it matter if a few women die!" "If she wants to die, what can be done!" The Eleventh District Committee and the working group also used real people and real events to educate the masses about the Marriage Law. Several female cadres in the working group had been oppressed by the feudal marriage system and had attempted suicide several times without success. Later, they were protected by the new marriage system and gained freedom. Wang Shuluan, who attended the National Congress of Labor Models for Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, was one of them. At the mass meeting, the working group invited these female cadres to "speak from their own experience" and explain how the marriage system in the old society was unreasonable and how the Communist Party and the people's government helped women to stand up. When Wang Shuluan talked about how she got rid of the shackles of the feudal marriage system, how she became a labor model, and how she met Chairman Mao in Beijing, many women envied her and said, "If Wang Shuluan had died at that time, how could she have such glory today!" The broad masses of women began to develop the idea of opposing passive suicide and demanded reasonable solutions to their marriage problems. After that, the comrades of the working group comforted the families of the three deceased; they also visited the women who also wanted to commit suicide, understood the reasons why they wanted to commit suicide, and explained the Marriage Law to them, supporting them in fighting against the barbaric marriage system. This made them realize that death does not solve the problem, and if they want to get a happy life, they must rise up and fight against the feudal marriage system. At this time, the Huian County Judicial Section and the Huian Democratic Women's Federation held a mass meeting in the Eleventh District to announce marriage cases and continue to expand the propaganda of the Marriage Law. After the meeting, Zhang Xiuzhi, a woman from Donghu Township, said: "The marriage law of the people's government is reasonable and legal. The old society forced us women to take the road of suicide. The new society leads women to stand up. We women can no longer take that stupid road (suicide)."

    After this vigorous propaganda, the trend of collective suicide among women was finally curbed, the sense of responsibility of district and township cadres to protect the lives of women was strengthened, and the views of some cadres who belittled women were criticized. Now, the effect of this propaganda is gradually expanding. After listening to the propaganda about the Marriage Law in literacy classes, women in Shanxia Township in the Fourth District immediately put forward the slogan "Don't live in the mother's home often." Woman Liu Meixia said: "Who wants to live in the mother's home often? Isn't it forced by feudal malpractices?" After this propaganda, twenty-one young men and women in Xiaocuo Township in the Ninth District held a collective wedding. And nine nuns, under the protection of the Marriage Law, gained marital freedom and established happy families. The masses said: "This is really a miracle!"

### 福建惠安妇女集体自杀现象仍然存在  中共福建省委等组织坚决予以制止

　　福建惠安妇女集体自杀现象仍然存在
    中共福建省委等组织坚决予以制止
    中共福建省委、福建省民主妇女联合会及中共惠安县委、惠安县民主妇女联合会，采取种种有效措施，坚决消灭惠安县妇女因婚姻问题而集体自杀的现象。
    福建省惠安县在历史上就存在着妇女集体自杀的风气。这在全国来说虽然是特殊的情况，但却是十分严重的现象。在国民党政府罪恶统治下，据该县第三区统计：每天平均有一个妇女自杀。这是一个惊人的数字。这种情况一直在发展着。解放后，妇女集体自杀现象虽已减少，但未消灭。
    今年六月间，惠安县十一区尚厝村发生了三个妇女干部集体自杀的事件。这三个妇女干部，一个是乡农会委员陈棉花，一个是乡妇女代表陈美瓯，一个是乡农会小组长陈岁娘。三人都还年青，工作都很积极，在群众中很有威信。但她们三人常因自己的婚姻问题得不到合理解决而苦恼。陈棉花十六岁结婚，今年已二十四岁，夫妇感情一直不好；陈美瓯、陈岁娘结婚后，虽然夫妇感情还好，但因受封建婚姻制度的限制，不能自由地和丈夫在一起。今年六月二日晚上，陈棉花等参加演戏后，便相约穿上漂亮的衣服，一同跳水自杀。
    这件集体自杀案子对群众的影响是很不好的。在她们死后，附近各乡的妇女有的就说：“像她们那么能干，还要去死，我那天才能熬出来！”于是也想去自杀。据初步调查，当时想自杀的妇女竟有六七十个之多。
    妇女集体自杀的原因主要是不满于封建的婚姻制度。惠安一带有这样的风俗：妇女结婚后，只能头三天在婆家住，以后只有过年过节才可以回婆家住几天。个别地区的妇女回婆家时，还得用块布遮着脸，到晚上熄灯后才能去掉。第二天天不亮又得跑回娘家。这样有许多夫妇虽然结婚数年，还不认识。同时惠安县又存在着严重的早婚现象。女的十二、三岁就要出嫁。这样夫妇之间当然不会有什么感情。因此妇女便以死来反抗这种野蛮的婚姻制度。每年到了“普渡”时节（七月间），到处发生集体自杀事件。
    解放后，特别是经过抗美援朝、镇压反革命、土地改革三大运动后，群众觉悟普遍的提高，妇女在政治上经济上的地位也随着提高。但是由于封建婚姻制度根深蒂固，当地党组织与人民政府，对解决妇女的特殊的痛苦还注意不够，没有认真组织力量，彻底摧毁野蛮的婚姻制度，以致解放两年来，仍继续发生妇女自杀事件。据不完全统计：自一九四九年十月至一九五○年八月，惠安妇女自杀的有一百二十二人。
    陈棉花等三个干部集体自杀的事件发生后，当地中共第十一区区委立即召集各乡干部开会讨论，设法遏止这种集体自杀风气。中共福建省委及福建省民主妇联闻讯后，也派遣干部，与中共惠安县委、县民主妇联共同组成工作组，协助第十一区区委解决这一问题。第十一区区委和工作组即先后召开区乡干部会议、民兵大会、青年团员会、妇女代表会，给大家讲解婚姻法，着重指出：在封建婚姻制度及封建恶习束缚下，男女双方都是痛苦的，而妇女更加痛苦，妇女自杀完全是封建婚姻制度逼迫的。在这些会上，有许多妇女干部诉苦。同时对过去消极自杀的思想作了自我批评。男干部也检讨了轻视妇女的观点，批判了“死几个妇女有什么关系！”“她自己要死，有什么办法！”等等的错误看法。第十一区区委和工作组又以真人真事，向群众进行了关于婚姻法的教育。工作组中有几个妇女干部，都受过封建婚姻制度的压迫，曾自杀数次未死，以后得到新婚姻制度的保障，获得了自由，出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的王淑鸾就是其中一个。在群众大会，工作组请这些妇女干部“现身说法”，讲解旧社会的婚姻制度不合理，共产党、人民政府怎样帮助妇女翻身。当王淑鸾讲到她怎样摆脱了封建婚姻制度的束缚，怎样当了劳动模范，到北京见到了毛主席时，许多妇女羡慕地说：“要是王淑鸾那时死了，那有今天这样光荣！”广大妇女开始产生了反对消极自杀的思想，要求合理解决自己的婚姻问题。此后，工作组的同志安慰了三个死者的家属；还访问了也想自杀的妇女，了解了她们想要自杀的原因，并向她们讲解了婚姻法，支持她们向野蛮的婚姻制度作斗争。这样使她们认识到死是不解决问题的，要想得到幸福的生活，必须起来和封建婚姻制度进行斗争。这时惠安县司法科与惠安民主妇联又在十一区召开群众大会，宣判婚姻案件，继续扩大婚姻法的宣传。会后，东湖乡妇女张秀治说：“人民政府的婚姻法是合情合理的，旧社会逼迫着我们妇女走上自杀道路，新社会领导妇女翻身，我们妇女再不能走那条傻路（自杀）。”
    经过这次大力宣传，终于遏止了妇女集体自杀风气，加强了区乡干部保护妇女生命安全的责任感，批判了某些干部轻视妇女的观点。现在，这一宣传的效果正在逐渐扩大。四区山霞乡妇女们在识字班里听了关于婚姻法的宣传后，当场提出“不常住娘家”的口号。妇女刘妹吓说：“谁愿意常住娘家呢，还不是被封建恶习逼迫的。”经过这次宣传后，九区萧厝乡有二十一对青年男女举行集体结婚。并有九个尼姑在婚姻法的保障下，获得了婚姻自由，建立了幸福的家庭。群众说：“这真是千古奇谈呀！”
