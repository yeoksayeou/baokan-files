Xi'an Railway Sub-bureau Chang'an Locomotive Depot
    Initial Completion of Asset Inventory

The Chang'an Locomotive Depot of the Xi'an Railway Sub-bureau preliminarily completed its asset inventory and capital verification work on October 19th. After this asset inventory and capital verification, the depot discovered surplus assets sufficient to build 1.7 locomotive depots of the same scale. The surplus materials are more than seven times the amount required. The turnover rate of working capital has also accelerated. For example, material costs used to turn over once every eight months, but now it only takes one month.

In the two years since liberation, the Chang'an Locomotive Depot had undergone two previous inventory efforts, but both were incomplete. Due to the continuing existence of an attitude among cadres that focused solely on completing production tasks without regard to costs, and a lack of attention to business management, the depot still faced serious problems with material stockpiling and waste. For example, material costs in July and August exceeded the quota by one-third. The warehouse inventory revealed various small fuse boxes that had not been used for more than a decade, as well as round-head machine screws that would not be used up in more than a decade. Additionally, off-the-books precious materials such as white alloy and steel plates, valued at over 380 million yuan, were discovered.

The Chang'an Locomotive Depot’s asset inventory and capital verification work was carried out by seven capital verification groups established according to production departments. During the inventory process, they were able to effectively mobilize all employees to participate. Some employees dug out broken coal pressed under the railway tracks, weighed it, and recorded it in the books. Fang Zhirong, a 71-year-old engineer, also identified, one by one, ten smoke pipes that had rusted and become scrap, and put them to use. After the capital verification, the depot has initially established various systems such as material requisition and return, tool manufacturing, and tool storage. This has saved a significant amount of capital.

### 西安铁路分局长安机务段  清理资产工作初步完成

    西安铁路分局长安机务段
    清理资产工作初步完成
    西安铁路分局长安机务段清理资产核定资金工作已在十月十九日初步完成。该段经过清理资产核定资金以后，发现多余的资产可建设同样规模的一点七个机务段，其中富余的材料约等于需用量的七倍还多。流动资金周转率也已加速，如材料费过去八个月周转一次，现在只需一个月就能周转一次。
    长安机务段在解放后两年中，曾经过两次清理工作，但都不彻底。由于干部中还存在着只管完成生产任务，不计成本的思想，不注意经营管理，该段材料积压和浪费现象仍很严重。如七、八两月份的材料费比定量多三分之一；在仓库里清查出十几年没有动用过的各种小保险盒和十几年也用不完的圆头机器螺丝，并发现账外价值三亿八千多万元的白合金、钢板等贵重材料多种。
    长安机务段清理资产核定资金工作是按生产部门成立七个核定资金小组分头进行的。在清理过程中，他们能很好发动全体职工参加工作。有的职工把压在铁轨底下的碎煤挖出来，过秤登账；七十一岁的老工程师方直荣，也把已锈坏成为废品的十根烟管一根一根地鉴定出来，加以利用。该段在核定资金后，已初步建立了领料退料、制造工具和保管工具等各种制度。这样，就节省了大量资金。
