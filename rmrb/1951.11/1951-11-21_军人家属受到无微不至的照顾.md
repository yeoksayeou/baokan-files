    Meticulous Care Given to Families of Military Personnel
    I am a student at a certain military academy. Before liberation, my family was a microcosm of the countless suffering families in old China. Due to that man-eat-man system, my own flesh and blood were torn apart.
    After the liberation of Nanjing, my family was reunited. My eldest younger brother, under the care of the People's Government, found work. Every time he writes, he expresses his determination to work hard in production. My eldest younger sister, who had been wandering in the homes of relatives, also found work. She signed the patriotic pact, stating: "I will donate one thousand yuan every month to buy airplanes and cannons, work hard to increase production, and strive to learn professional skills and culture." My two younger brothers and sisters were sent by the government to military dependents' nurseries to study. They recently returned home, and the government provided them with new cotton quilts, clothes, shoes, and hats, and the government provides each of them with 70 catties of rice per month as living expenses, and their education remains free until they can support themselves. My six-year-old younger brother once said to me, "Brother, when I grow up, I want to be a soldier in the People's Liberation Army, a Communist Party member!" My disabled mother regularly receives free medical care from the People's Government; residents' groups actively help my mother with laundry, cooking, and cleaning. The People's Government often invites her to attend various meetings to discuss national affairs. Every New Year and festival, not only do the masses come to offer their regards, but the People's Government also invites my family to see plays and movies. At a military dependents' study meeting, my mother gratefully said, "I will tell my son to listen to Chairman Mao and work hard in the People's Liberation Army! I will also encourage him to work hard to resist America and aid Korea, and protect our homes and defend our country. When my younger son grows up, I will also tell him to join the army!"
    Only two years after the founding of New China, my family has crossed from one world into another. I deeply feel the preciousness of the fruits of victory in New China, and I feel even more the supreme honor of being a soldier defending the people's motherland. In order to protect my mother, brothers, and sisters, and to protect millions upon millions of mothers, brothers, and sisters, I will work hard to learn my skills, ready to strike any enemy.

    军人家属受到无微不至的照顾
    我是某军事学校的一个学员。解放前，我的家庭是旧中国千千万万个苦难家庭的缩影。由于那人吃人的制度，我一个家庭的亲骨肉给活活地拆散了。
    南京解放后，我的家庭团聚了。我的大弟弟，在人民政府的关怀下，有了工作。他每次来信，都表示要努力生产。我那个流落在亲戚家里的大妹妹，同样也有了工作。她在爱国公约上订了：“要每月捐献一千元买飞机大炮，要努力增加生产；要努力学习业务、文化。”我的两个小弟弟小妹妹，被政府送到军属子弟教养院里去学习。他们最近回到家里，政府给他们做了新的棉被、衣服、鞋、帽，并且按月由政府发给每人七十斤大米作为生活费用，读书仍为免费，直到他们能够自立生活时为止。六岁的小弟弟曾向我表示：“哥哥，我长大了要当解放军，当共产党员！”我的残废的母亲，经常得到人民政府的免费医药；居民小组主动地来帮助我母亲洗衣、烧饭、打扫。人民政府经常请她出席各种会议，讨论国家大事。每逢年节，不但群众来慰问，人民政府还招待我家里人看戏、看电影。我母亲在一次军属学习会上感激地说：“我要叫我儿子听毛主席的话，好好在解放军里作工作！我还要鼓励他努力抗美援朝、保家卫国。小儿子长大了也叫他去参军！”
    新中国成立只两年，我的家庭已从一个世界跨进另一个世界。我深刻地感到新中国胜利果实的珍贵，我更加感到做一个保卫人民祖国的战士的崇高荣誉。我为了保卫我母亲、弟、妹，保卫千千万万个母亲、弟、妹，我要努力学好本领，准备着打击任何敌人。　钟晓村
