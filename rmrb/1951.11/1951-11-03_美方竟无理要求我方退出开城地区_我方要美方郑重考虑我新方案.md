Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 2nd. Our special correspondent reports: At the fourteenth session of the truce talks' sub-group meeting held on the 1st, the U.S. side representatives still insisted on the absurd demand that our side withdraw from the Kaesong area, and refused to accept our side's new proposal put forward on the 31st regarding the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone. Our side's representatives pointed out at the meeting to the other side's representatives: This action of the other side makes people doubt whether the U.S. side has the sincerity to quickly reach an agreement on the second agenda item, so as to enter the discussion of other agenda items and end the Korean War at an early date.

The new proposal put forward by our side on the 31st, which is basically based on a ceasefire in place, is the only practical and reasonable plan to end the Korean War under the current circumstances. This plan strictly follows the existing line of contact between the two sides' forces, except for a few necessary and reasonable adjustments. The fact that the U.S. side representatives refused to consider accepting our side's reasonable proposal has exposed the complete hypocrisy of the U.S. side's so-called proposal to use the current battle line as the basis for a truce to the people of the world. Furthermore, the U.S. side's insistence on the absurd demand that our side withdraw from the Kaesong area further shows that the U.S. side representatives have not given up their delusion of plundering our territory at the negotiating table. As in the past, the U.S. side representatives searched for some absurd arguments at the meeting to quibble for their own absurd demands, saying that our side's withdrawal from the Kaesong area was for the "defense" of Seoul, etc. These fallacies have long been refuted by our side. Everyone knows that the United States, in the name of "defense," has occupied our country's Taiwan, Japan, and other countries. The U.S. side representatives' continued insistence on such fallacies and absurd demands at the meeting can only be explained as an attempt to hinder the rapid agreement on the second agenda item. When our side's representatives put forward the new proposal on the 31st, they pointed out that this proposal was our side's greatest possible effort to resolve the second agenda item, requesting the other side to carefully consider and accept this proposal. At the sub-group meeting on the afternoon of the 1st, our side's representatives once again asked the U.S. side representatives to give it serious consideration and stated their attitude towards our side's proposal at the sub-group meeting on the 2nd.

    美方竟无理要求我方退出开城地区
    我方要美方郑重考虑我新方案
    【新华社开城二日电】本社特派记者报道：在一日举行的停战谈判第十四次小组会上，美方代表仍坚持要我方退出开城地区的荒谬要求，拒绝接受我方三十一日提出的关于军事分界线与非军事区的新方案。我方代表在会上向对方代表指出：对方这一行动使人们怀疑美方是否具有迅速达成第二项议程的协议，以进入其他几项议程的讨论，使朝鲜战争早日结束的诚意。
    我方代表三十一日提出的基本上以就地停战为内容的新方案，乃是一个在目前情况下结束朝鲜战争的唯一切实可行的合理方案。这个方案除了少数必要的合理调整以外，是严格地遵照了现有的双方部队的接触线。美方代表拒绝考虑接受我方这一合理提案的事实，已在全世界人民面前暴露了美方所谓以目前战线为停战基础方案的全部虚伪性。而美方坚持要我方退出开城地区的荒谬要求，又进一步表明了美方代表还没有放弃在会议桌上掠夺我方土地的妄想。像过去一样，美方代表在会议上寻找了若干荒谬的论点来为自己的荒谬要求进行狡辩，说什么要我方退出开城地区是为了“防卫”汉城等等，这些谬论是早已被我方驳倒了的。谁都知道，美国就是以“防御”为名侵占我国台湾，侵占日本及其他国家的。美方代表在会上仍然坚持这种谬论和荒谬要求，只能作一个解释，就是为了阻碍第二项议程的迅速达成协议。我方代表在三十一日提出新方案时，曾指出这一方案乃是我方为了解决第二项议程所作的最大可能的努力，要求对方慎重考虑，并接受这一方案。在一日下午的小组会上，我方代表再一次要求美方代表加以郑重考虑，并在二日的小组会上表明对我方方案的态度。
