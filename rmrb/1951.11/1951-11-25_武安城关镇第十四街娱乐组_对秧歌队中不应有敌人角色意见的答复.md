    Response to Opinions on the Inappropriateness of Enemy Characters in Yangge Teams
    Comrade Editor: In the "Reader's Letters" column of the November 6th People's Daily, Comrade Hao Zhinan pointed out that including enemy characters in our Yangge team, dancing together with the whole team, can easily create a blurred impression of the distinction between the enemy and ourselves. This criticism is correct. After reading Comrade Hao's letter of criticism, we held a meeting of all personnel for self-examination and concluded that the main reason for this error was our weak political awareness and insufficient understanding of the seriousness of current affairs propaganda work. In the future, we will strive to overcome this shortcoming to prevent such errors from happening again.

    对秧歌队中不应有敌人角色意见的答复
    编辑同志：十一月六日人民日报“读者来信”栏内，郝指南同志指出我们的秧歌队中插入敌人角色，和全队一起舞蹈，容易造成敌我不分的印象。这个批评是正确的。我们看了郝同志的批评信后，曾召开了全体人员会议进行检查，认为造成这个错误的主要原因是我们政治性不强，对于时事宣传工作的严肃性认识不够。今后我们要努力克服这个缺点，使这类错误不再发生。
