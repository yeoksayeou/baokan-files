    North China Regional Urban and Rural Materials Exchange Exhibition
    Transaction Volume Reaches Over 113 Billion Yuan
    Northeast Materials Exchange Conference Launches Large-Scale Trading Activities
    The North China Regional Urban and Rural Materials Exchange Exhibition has played a significant role in connecting urban and rural areas and organizing the exchange of materials. Since its opening on October 5th, the exhibition has attracted 500,000 visitors, including approximately 15,000 organized farmer representatives from various regions. The transactions conducted at this exhibition are of national scale. Trade delegations from major administrative regions and many provinces and cities have been conducting trading activities at the conference. Under the organization and leadership of the conference and with the strong support of the Central Trade Department, various trade delegations have implemented the policy of considering both public and private interests and promoted the spirit of mutual benefit and reciprocity, actively signing contracts. As of the 5th of this month, the transaction volume has reached over 113 billion yuan, surpassing the transaction figures of previous national materials exchange exhibitions. The transactions mainly involve local specialties and special products, followed by daily necessities, aquatic products, and livestock products. Through this transaction, large-scale exchange of local products has been further developed. Ephedra from Inner Mongolia and Chahar is sold to Shanghai, and Sichuan silk is sold to the Northeast. Some slow-moving products have found markets. Trade delegations from various regions have paid special attention to the severely affected provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan and have tried their best to meet the trade requirements of the Northeast region. The existing trade routes in North China and other regions have been further consolidated in this transaction, and many new trade routes have been established.
    Currently, the trading work of the conference is continuing vigorously, with the focus on organizing transactions within North China. Professional symposiums are being held in a planned manner to mobilize and organize public and private forces, not only to organize large-scale transactions of local products but also to vigorously promote small-scale transactions of local products, to meet the purchasing and sales requirements of various regions as much as possible.

    Since its opening more than a month ago, the Northeast Regional Materials Exchange Exhibition has launched large-scale trading activities. According to incomplete statistics, as of the end of October, the conference's trading office has signed trade contracts and agreements with delegations from North China, East China, Central South, and Southwest China, totaling 472.2 billion yuan. To meet the requirements of representatives from various regions, the Trade Department of the Northeast People's Government has supplied 11,000 cubic meters of timber, 10,000 tons of scrap steel, 5,000 tons of various copper materials, 10,000 boxes of glass, and 1,780 tons of granulated sugar to various parts of the country, without affecting the economic construction plan of the Northeast administrative region. The Southwest China delegation requested the Northeast to assist in the construction of gunny sack factories in Sichuan and other places. The complete mechanical equipment drawings of the gunny sack factories are currently being designed and drawn by the Northeast State-owned Grain Company. The Machinery Industry Administration Bureau of the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government accepted the order from Yongchuan Coal Mine in eastern Sichuan, Southwest China, for 20 kilometers of light railway tracks and three small locomotives. According to the provisions of the trade contracts and agreements signed at this conference, various parts of the country will supply the Northeast with materials such as woolen fabrics, silk, and silk floss from the Southwest, porcelain and Xiang embroidery from the Central South, silk fabrics and tea from Zhejiang, bicycles from Shanghai, tussah silk from Shandong, knitwear, pottery, and condiments from southern Jiangsu, carpets and stationery from North China, and fur goods from Beijing.
    Through the trading activities of this conference, some slow-moving products in the Northeast region and various parts of the country have found broad markets. Gentian and astragalus and other medicinal materials from the Northeast region can now be sold smoothly throughout the country. The North China delegation has signed an agreement with the Northeast Coal Industry Building Materials Company for the supply of 100,000 tons of Shanxi gypsum. The Southwest China delegation has also signed a mercury supply agreement with the Northeast. Silk from Zhejiang, southern Jiangsu, and Nanjing, cabbage from Shandong, and persimmons from Henan have all found markets in the Northeast. Cotton cloth, ramie cloth, and lotus seeds from Central South are very popular among the people of the Northeast. Jiangxi porcelain did not sell well in the Northeast at the beginning of this year, but after promotion at this exhibition, it is now in short supply. (Xinhua News Agency)
