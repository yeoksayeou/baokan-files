　　No Bomb Can Stop Our Car's Path Forward
　　—Remembering the Heroic Deeds of Zhao Liangxuan, Deputy Driver of a Motor Vehicle of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
　　You Zai

　　The evening glow emitted ten thousand rays of golden light. The green mountains and rivers of Korea, under the reflection of the setting sun, appeared exceptionally beautiful and lovely.

　　Deputy driver Zhao Liangxuan was driving along the mountain ridge. The driver sat beside him. The Chief of Staff of a certain motor vehicle regiment was going to a certain place on business and hitched a ride in this car.

　　Turning the bend, ahead was a straight and smooth road. Zhao Liangxuan pressed the accelerator, adjusted the brake handle, and said to the driver beside him: "Look! Let's have a good run!"

　　The car sped along.

　　Suddenly, several trucks ahead, fully loaded with soldiers of the People's Army, stopped with a "screech." The driver hurriedly pulled the handbrake, and Zhao Liangxuan's vehicle also stopped. Zhao Liangxuan jumped out of the cab, and a comrade from the air defense哨 came to tell him: "This afternoon, enemy planes dropped three thunderbolt bombs (a type of time-delayed bomb) on the road ahead."

　　Zhao Liangxuan looked up and saw a crossroads ahead. A rope of grass tightly blocked the road, and a wooden sign with the word "Danger" written on it swayed in the wind.

　　This was precisely when transportation tasks were urgent. Before long, the crossroads were filled with vehicles on all sides. According to the pattern of enemy aircraft activity, in areas where they have dropped time-delayed bombs, the enemy planes will launch a frenzied bombing and strafing attack three to four hours later.

　　Yang Zili, a driver from the Second Company, thought of a way to use a grass rope to make a slipknot to try to pull the thunderbolt bomb and detonate it. However, after several attempts, he failed. People were getting anxious. Zhao Liangxuan also frowned and pondered to himself: "The enemy's bombs, time-delayed bombs, and thunderclaps... have never interrupted our transportation lines. Can a few small thunderbolt bombs hinder our transportation?" He gave himself an affirmative answer: "Absolutely not!" So, he straightened his chest and ran to the Chief of Staff, standing at attention with a "whoosh": "Report, Chief of Staff, please allow me to clear the thunderbolt bombs!"

　　The Chief of Staff carefully looked at Zhao Liangxuan's face, flushed with excitement, his full chest, and his sturdy body. He agreed, repeatedly urging him to be careful.

　　Zhao Liangxuan jumped over the grass rope and stopped after walking seven or eight steps. The first thunderbolt bomb was right in front of Zhao Liangxuan's feet. Without hesitation, he squatted down, carefully examined how the thunderbolt bomb was buried, and began digging.

　　Everyone lay down. But they all looked up, watching Zhao Liangxuan's every move with great concern.

　　In less than five minutes, Zhao Liangxuan had already dug out the first thunderbolt bomb. He held the thunderbolt bomb in his hand, steadied his footing, and with a forceful throw, the thunderbolt bomb was thrown into a ditch.

　　The first cheer resounded on the road! Amidst the cheers, Zhao Liangxuan walked towards the place where the second thunderbolt bomb was buried. The Chief of Staff kept shouting: "Comrade Zhao Liangxuan! Be careful!"

　　Zhao Liangxuan turned around and said: "Chief of Staff, don't worry! The thunderbolt bomb can't bite me!" His heroic spirit moved an officer of the Korean People's Army, who also jumped over the grass rope and walked towards Zhao Liangxuan. Just as Zhao Liangxuan had dug out the second thunderbolt bomb, this officer snatched the thunderbolt bomb from Zhao Liangxuan's hand and threw it onto the sand by the river to explode.

　　The second cheer resounded on the road. By this time, many people had stood up. Zhao Liangxuan and the Korean People's Army officer walked towards the third thunderbolt bomb. The third thunderbolt bomb was the deepest one, and its wind wings had been broken off, leaving only a firing pin standing upright outside. The People's Army officer immediately turned around, gestured for everyone to lie down. He also lay down.

　　Facing this last thunderbolt bomb, Zhao Liangxuan wanted to dig several times, but each time he was afraid of touching the exposed firing pin and causing an explosion. He rubbed his hands vigorously. Time passed second by second. At this moment, the buzzing sound of enemy planes seemed to be approaching from afar. Zhao Liangxuan looked at the vehicles blocking the road on all sides, at least a hundred of them. If the enemy planes came, what a significant loss it would be! He thought of the expectations of the soldiers at the front, the people of the motherland, and his mother. There was no time for hesitation! Zhao Liangxuan steeled his heart, gritted his teeth, and his fingers plunged into the soil like steel needles!

　　The last, and most dangerous, thunderbolt bomb was also cleared. A frenzied cheer erupted on the road, and people applauded and jumped for joy. The Korean People's Army officer was the first to run forward, hug Zhao Liangxuan, and kiss his face, hair, and neck. The Chief of Staff also ran forward, grabbed Zhao Liangxuan's arm, and exclaimed excitedly: "Zhao Liangxuan, well done! You are our logistics unit's 'Dong Cunrui'!" At this moment, many Korean People's Army soldiers crowded around, lifted Zhao Liangxuan high, and threw him into the sky.

　　Cars drove away one after another. Just as Zhao Liangxuan's car climbed over a hilltop, he saw twelve large planes (B-29s) and twenty-odd small planes flying over the crossroads, strafing and bombing frantically...

　　A smile of victory floated on Zhao Liangxuan's face. He said to himself: "Let alone thunderbolt bombs, no bomb can stop us from advancing towards victory!"

　　任何炸弹也挡不住我们汽车的去路
    ——记人民志愿军某部汽车副驾驶员赵亮轩的英雄事迹
    尤在
    晚霞发出万道金光。朝鲜的青山绿水，在夕阳的辉映下，显得格外秀丽可爱了。
    副驾驶员赵亮轩开着车行进在山岗上。驾驶员坐在他的身旁。某汽车团的参谋长因事到某地去，也搭便坐在这辆车上。
    转过弯，前面就是一条笔直溜平的大道。赵亮轩踩开了油门，扶了扶闸把，对他旁边的驾驶员说： “看！咱跑一趟欢的！”
    汽车飞驰着。
    突然，前面的几台满载着人民军的卡车“嘎”的一声停住了。驾驶员忙着把手闸一拉，赵亮轩驾驶的车也停住了。赵亮轩从驾驶台跑出来，防空哨同志赶来告诉他：“今天下午敌机在前面公路上丢下了三颗风雷弹（定时弹的一种）。”
    赵亮轩抬头一看，前面是一个十字路口，一条草绳团团地拦断了公路，草绳上挂着一块写有“危险”字样的木牌，在迎风摆动着。
    这正是运输任务紧迫的时候。不一会儿，这十字路口的四围都停满了汽车。根据敌机活动的规律，在它投掷了定时炸弹的地区，在隔了三四个钟头以后，敌机便要来进行一次疯狂的轰炸和扫射。
    二连司机杨自立，想了个办法，他用草绳套了个活圈，想把风雷弹套住拉响。但是，套了几次，都失败了。人们都在焦急着。赵亮轩也皱紧了眉头，低垂着头在暗自地合计着：“敌人的炸弹、定时弹、炸雷……都没有中断过我们的运输线，难道几个小小的风雷弹就能够阻碍着我们的运输吗？”他给自己作了肯定的回答：“绝对不能！”于是，他挺起胸膊，跑到参谋长面前，“刷”的一声立正站住了：“报告参谋长，请允许我去把风雷弹清除掉！”
    参谋长仔细地看了看赵亮轩激动得闪着红光的脸孔，饱满的胸膛，茁壮的身体，答应了他，并一再叮咛着他要注意，小心。
    赵亮轩跳越过草绳，向前走了七、八步就停了下来。第一颗风雷弹就在赵亮轩的脚前。他毫不犹豫地蹲下来，仔细地看了风雷弹埋陷的情形后，便动手扒起土来了。
    人们都卧倒了。但却都抬起头，万分关心地看着赵亮轩的一举一动。
    不到五分钟的时间，赵亮轩已经扒出了第一颗风雷弹，他把风雷弹托在手心里，稳了稳脚跟，使劲地一甩，风雷弹便被扔到一条河沟里去了。
    公路上响起了第一次的欢呼声！在欢呼声中，赵亮轩走向了第二颗风雷弹埋陷的地方。参谋长还是一个劲地叫着：“赵亮轩同志！当心，注意！”
    赵亮轩回过头来说：“参谋长，放心吧！风雷弹咬不了我的！”他的英雄气概，感动了一个朝鲜人民军的军官，也跳过了草绳，向赵亮轩走去。当赵亮轩刚把第二颗风雷弹扒出来的时候，这位军官就从赵亮轩的手里，将风雷弹抢了过来，扔在河边的沙滩上爆炸了。
    公路上响起了第二次欢呼。这时，已经有许多人站起来了。赵亮轩和朝鲜人民军军官向着第三颗风雷弹走去。第三颗风雷弹是埋陷得最深的一颗，风翅膀已经被震断了，只剩下一根撞针在外面直立着。人民军军官当即回过头来，做手势叫大家卧倒。他自己也跟着卧倒了。
    赵亮轩面对着这最后一颗风雷弹，几次想动手扒土，几次都怕触动了暴露在外面的撞针而引起爆炸，他使劲地搓着双手，时间一秒一秒地过去，这时远方似乎传来了嗡嗡来袭的敌机的声音。赵亮轩看了看四面堵住的车辆，至少有一百多台；如果敌机来到，这个损失该是多么重大！他想起了前方的战士们、祖国人民和母亲的期望。时间再不容许迟疑了！赵亮轩心一横，牙一咬，手指就像钢针一样地钻进泥土里去了！
    最后一颗也是最危险的一颗风雷弹，也被肃清了。公路上发出了狂热的欢呼声，人们都鼓掌欢跳起来。朝鲜人民军军官第一个跑上前去，抱着赵亮轩，就在他的脸上、头发上、脖子上吻起来了；参谋长也跑上前去，抓住赵亮轩的胳膊，兴奋地叫道：“赵亮轩，好样的！你是咱们后勤部队里的‘董存瑞’！”这时，许多朝鲜人民军都拥了上来，把赵亮轩高高举起，抛向天空。
    汽车一辆接着一辆地开走了。赵亮轩驾驶的车刚翻上一个山头，就看见十二架大飞机（B二九）和二十几架小飞机飞临在十字路口的上空疯狂地扫射着、轰炸着……。
    赵亮轩的脸上浮起了胜利的微笑。他自言自语地说：“别说是风雷弹，就是任何炸弹也挡不住我们走向胜利的道路！”
