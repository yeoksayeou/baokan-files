Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 21st: The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) Council meeting, on the afternoon of the 17th and the morning of the 18th, discussed the second item on the agenda: the report on "the unity of working people in the struggle to improve living conditions and oppose the economic and social consequences of the policy of war preparations."

At the afternoon session on the 17th, Kuznetsov, Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union, stated that as a result of accepting the United States' enslaving Marshall Plan and expanding arms and preparing for war, the national economies of Western European countries have fallen into a desperate situation, and the suffering of the working people has deepened. He said that the French government received 500 billion francs from the so-called Marshall Plan assistance from 1947 to 1951, but spent 2,047 billion francs on war preparations. During the same period, France's foreign debt increased from 300 billion francs to 1,290 billion francs. From April 3, 1948, to December 31, 1950, Britain received $2,704,600,000 under the Marshall Plan, but during the same period, Britain's military expenditure amounted to approximately $11 billion. The British government will allocate another £4.7 billion to expand armaments in the next three years. This will require every British worker to contribute at least one year's income in the next three years, and the already low standard of living will be reduced by 30 to 35 percent. The total amount of military spending for the entire Atlantic aggressive bloc in 1951-52, even according to obviously redacted official figures, will reach $190 billion. This sum is sufficient for a country with a population of 240 million to maintain itself for one year under normal living conditions. Kuznetsov then described the achievements of peaceful construction in the Soviet Union, the People's Democracies, and China, and pointed out that these achievements have inspired the working people of capitalist and colonial countries to carry out arduous struggles against oppressors and instigators of a new war.

When talking about the tasks of the WFTU and various trade unions, Kuznetsov said that trade union organizations must actively participate in the preparation for international conferences and international economic conferences on social insurance and social security issues.

The Greek representative, Siossos, denounced the United States for controlling Greece's economic and political life, saying that the Greek people are tenaciously fighting to defend their rights, defend peace, and demand amnesty for patriots.

The South African representative, Burke, described the situation of slave labor of South African workers in his speech, and condemned the United States for controlling the mining and other economic sectors of the Union of South Africa and using South African resources for war preparations. Burke emphasized that the South African people are actively fighting for peace and for their national liberation.

The Latin American trade union leader, Toledano, then spoke. He emphasized the need to strengthen the struggle to defend the national economies of Latin America and other countries under the enslavement of US and British imperialism.

At the meeting on the morning of the 18th, Herbig, the representative of the German Democratic Republic, was the first to speak. He denounced the right-wing leaders of West German trade unions for colluding with imperialists, betraying the interests of the working class, advocating the arming of West Germany, and supporting the Schuman Plan. He emphasized that the struggle of West German workers has not stopped because of this, and they have organized committees to lead strikes. Their unity in the struggle is growing stronger.

Oren, the Jewish worker representative from Israel, and Toubi, the Arab worker representative, guaranteed in their speeches that the working people of Israel would unite and fight to defend peace and improve living standards.

The Australian trade union representative, Elliot, then spoke, denouncing the United States for turning Australia into its military outpost.

Diallo, the representative of French Sudan, described the intensification of exploitation of the African people by imperialists, the implementation of racial discrimination, the preparation for war, and the suppression of the trade union movement. He pointed out that the main tasks of African trade unions are to strive for national independence, to strive for the social rights of working people, and to defend world peace.

Representatives from Africa, Italy, and British Guiana also spoke at the two-day meeting. Representatives from the International Democratic Women's Federation, Dubois, and the International Labor Organization, Grunwald, delivered congratulatory messages at the meeting.

    世界工联理事会会议讨论第二项议程
    各国代表痛斥美国的扩军备战政策
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：世界工会联合会理事会十七日下午和十八日上午会议，讨论了议程的第二项：关于“劳动人民在争取改善生活条件、反对备战政策的经济和社会后果的斗争中的团结”的报告。
    在十七日下午会议上，全苏工会中央理事会主席库兹涅佐夫发言指出：西欧国家由于接受美国奴役性的马歇尔计划和扩军备战的结果，国民经济已陷入绝境，劳动人民的苦难也愈益加深。他说：法国政府在一九四七年到一九五一年内，从所谓马歇尔计划的援助中得到了五千亿法郎，但却花了二万零四百七十亿法郎来进行备战。在同一时期内，法国的外债已从三千亿法郎增加到一万二千九百亿法郎。从一九四八年四月三日到一九五○年十二月三十一日，英国在马歇尔计划项下得到了二十七亿零四百六十万美元，但在同一时期内，英国的军费开支约达一百一十亿美元。英国政府在今后三年里还要拨出四十七亿英镑来扩张军备。这将使得在今后三年中，每一个英国劳动者至少要拿出一年的收入来，现在已经够低的生活水平还要降低百分之三十到三十五。整个大西洋侵略集团在一九五一—五二年间的扩军费用总数，就是根据显然是删改了的官方数字也要达到一千九百亿美元。这笔钱足够让一个二亿四千万人口的国家在通常的生活条件下维持一年。库兹涅佐夫接着叙述了苏联、人民民主国家和中国的和平建设的成就，并指出：这些成就鼓舞了资本主义和殖民地国家的劳动人民，为反对压迫者、反对新战争的挑拨者而进行艰苦的斗争。
    库兹涅佐夫在谈到世界工联和各工会的任务时说：工会组织必须积极参加关于讨论社会保险、社会赡养问题的国际会议和国际经济会议的筹备工作。
    希腊代表席奥斯痛斥了美国控制希腊的经济和政治生活，他说：希腊人民正顽强地为保卫自己权利、保卫和平、要求大赦爱国者而斗争。
    南非代表柏克在发言中叙述南非工人奴隶劳动的情况，并斥责美国控制南非联邦的矿业和其他经济部门利用南非的资源进行战争准备。柏克强调说：南非人民正在为和平、为他们的民族解放而积极斗争。
    拉丁美洲工会领袖托列达诺继起发言。他强调必须加强为保卫拉丁美洲和美英帝国主义奴役下的其他国家的国民经济的独立而进行的斗争。
    在十八日上午的会议上，首先发言的德意志民主共和国代表赫尔比希，痛斥西德工会右翼领导者和帝国主义者相勾结，出卖工人阶级利益，主张武装西德和支持舒曼计划。他强调说：但是，西德工人的斗争并没有因此而停止，他们已组织了领导罢工的委员会。他们在斗争中的团结是越来越加强了。
    以色列的犹太族工人代表奥伦和阿拉伯工人代表杜比在发言中保证以色列劳动人民将团结一致，为保卫和平、提高生活水平而斗争。
    澳大利亚工会代表伊利奥特继起发言，他痛斥了美国将澳大利亚变成它的军事前哨的行径。
    法属苏丹代表迪亚洛叙述了帝国主义者加紧剥削非洲人民、实行种族歧视、准备战争和压迫工会运动的情况。他指出非洲各工会的主要任务是争取民族独立、争取劳动人民的社会权利和保卫世界和平。
    在两天的会议上发言的还有非洲、意大利、英属圭亚那的代表。国际民主妇女联合会代表杜波阿，以及国际劳工组织代表格伦瓦尔德曾在会上致贺辞。
