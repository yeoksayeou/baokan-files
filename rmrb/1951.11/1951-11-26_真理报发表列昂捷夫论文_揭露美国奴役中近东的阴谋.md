Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 20th: Leontiev published an article in *Pravda* entitled "American Plans to Enslave Arab Countries." He wrote: The vast regions of the Near East and Middle East have long been coveted by American militarists. American oil monopoly capital has already seized and continues to seize more exploitative targets in Arab countries. However, the ruling circles of the United States are no longer satisfied with this; they are even attempting to completely enslave Arab countries politically and to control them militarily without restriction. Arab countries have been subjected to new, crude pressure, threats, and blackmail. The ambassadors of the United States, Britain, France, and Turkey to Arab countries and the capital of Israel have announced in the form of an ultimatum the imminent establishment of a "Middle East Command." The attempt under this name is to piece together a new military alliance to supplement the aggressive North Atlantic Group.

Leontiev then mentioned the infighting between Anglo-American imperialism in the Middle East: The United States apparently does not intend to completely drive Britain out of Egypt and other countries in the Middle East at this time. The United States is willing to let Britain stay there, but it must be in a secondary position. The British bourgeois press wants to conceal the fact that Britain is subservient to its big boss and portray the behind-the-scenes negotiations between Britain and the United States as a wise "union" between allies. However, this clumsy tactic cannot hide the hatred between the two imperialist robbers who are desperately vying for markets and strategic positions in the East.

Leontiev continued: However, the quarrels within the imperialist camp do not hinder the imperialists from taking joint action on the issue of suppressing the national liberation struggles of the people of the Middle East countries. The proposal to establish a "Middle East Command" is a manifestation of this type of joint action. In fact, this move ultimately aims to rebuild in the Middle East the notorious trusteeship "system" hated by the people of all countries. Imperialist countries have adopted coercion, blackmail, threats, and high-pressure tactics in order to sell this new "alliance" to the countries of the Middle East. For this purpose, the existing hatred between Arab countries and Israel is first exploited. This hatred is currently being incited in every possible way.

American propaganda activities are now also focusing on frightening the bourgeoisie of Arab countries with the "communist threat." American, British, and French newspapers are full of lies about mythical "economic aid." However, intimidation and lobbying are not very effective. The people of the Near East and Middle East have long tasted the flavor of some "alliance" treaties and agreements signed with imperialism. The tragic precedents of the people of Western European countries are a lesson for them.

Leontiev concluded: The national liberation movement in the Near East and Middle East is constantly growing. The events in Egypt and Iran have shown that a prominent feature of this movement is that the vast majority of the people are united in a common struggle against foreign imperialist rule. The people of Arab countries are unwilling to become any form of colonial or semi-colonial country. They do not want to see foreign troops on their territory, regardless of what these troops are called—occupying forces or self-proclaimed "allied" forces. They are fully determined to achieve true independence.

    真理报发表列昂捷夫论文
    揭露美国奴役中近东的阴谋
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十日讯：列昂捷夫在“真理报”发表论文，题为“美国奴役阿拉伯各国的计划”。他写道：近东和中东的广大地区久已为美国军国主义者所垂涎。美国石油垄断资本在阿拉伯国家已经夺取到并在继续夺取更多的剥削目标。可是，美国的统治集团不再满足于此，他们更企图在政治上完全奴役阿拉伯国家，并在军事上无限制地控制阿拉伯国家。阿拉伯各国受到了新的粗暴的压力、威胁和讹诈。美、英、法、土驻在阿拉伯各国和以色列首都的大使们，以最后通谍的形式宣布“中东司令部”即将成立。在这个名称掩盖下的企图是：拼凑新的军事联盟以补充侵略性的北大西洋集团。
    列昂捷夫接着提到美英帝国主义在中东的钩心斗角的斗争说：美国现在显然还不打算把英国完全逐出埃及和中东其他国家。美国愿意让英国留在那里，但是它得屈居次要的地位。英国资产阶级的报纸要掩饰英国屈从于它的大老板这一事实，而把英国和美国进行的幕后谈判说成是盟国之间的明智的“联合”。但是，这种拙劣的手法掩饰不了正在拚命争夺东方的市场和战略地位的两个帝国主义强盗之间的仇恨。
    列昂捷夫继续写道：但是，帝国主义阵营内部的争吵，并不妨害帝国主义者在有关镇压中东各国人民的民族解放斗争问题上采取联合行动。成立“中东司令部”的建议就是这类联合行动的表现。事实上，此举最终目的是要在中东重建为各国人民所憎恨的恶名昭著的托管“制度”。帝国主义国家为了把这种新“联盟”卖给中东各国，采用了强迫、讹诈、威胁和高压手段。为了这个目的，首先利用了阿拉伯国家和以色列之间现有的仇恨。目前正在以各种可能的方法煽动这种仇恨。
    美国宣传活动现在也集中力量以“共产主义威胁”来恐吓阿拉伯国家的资产阶级。美、英、法报纸满纸尽是神话般的“经济援助”的谎言。但是，威吓和游说都不十分有效。近东和中东的人民早已尝到过与帝国主义签订的一些“同盟”条约和协定的味道。西欧各国人民的悲惨先例是他们的前车之鉴。
    列昂捷夫最后写道：近东和中东的民族解放运动正在不断壮大中。埃及和伊朗的事件已经说明了，这个运动的显著特点是绝大部分人民在反对外国帝国主义统治的共同斗争中团结起来了。阿拉伯各国人民不愿成为任何形式的殖民地或半殖民地国家。他们不愿意在他们的领土上看到外国军队，不管这些军队叫什么——占领军或自命的“盟国”的军队。他们有充分的决心要获得真正的独立。
