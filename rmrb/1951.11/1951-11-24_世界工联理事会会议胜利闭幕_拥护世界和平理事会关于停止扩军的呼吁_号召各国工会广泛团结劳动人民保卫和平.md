　　[Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 23rd] According to TASS, the Berlin meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council successfully concluded on the 21st. The meeting passed resolutions on the first item on the agenda, the report on "The Work of the World Federation of Trade Unions," and the second item on the agenda, the report on "The Unity of the Working People in the Struggle to Improve Living Conditions and Oppose the Economic and Social Consequences of the Policy of War Preparation," and adopted a letter to the working people of the world. The meeting unanimously approved the report of the Audit Committee and passed resolutions on social insurance, the defense of the thirty-four workers arrested in Barcelona, Spain, the situation in Greece, Iran, and West Germany, and the persecution of trade union activists in Venezuela, Chile, and Colombia. The meeting decided to submit the World Federation of Trade Unions' resolutions to the United Nations for consideration. The meeting expressed the World Federation of Trade Unions' endorsement of the World Peace Council's Vienna meeting's call for a movement to halt the expansion of armaments; and decided to renew its proposal calling on the so-called "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" to take concerted action to defend the living standards of the working people.

　　The resolution passed on the first item on the agenda stated that despite the frantic opposition of the imperialists and their agents lurking in the trade union movement, the influence of the World Federation of Trade Unions continues to expand, its membership continues to increase, and it now exceeds 80 million. The resolution calls for strengthening the activities of trade unions in all countries, uniting the working people of all countries regardless of political or religious beliefs or trade union affiliation, and fighting for better working and living conditions and for the defense of peace.

　　The resolution passed on the second item on the agenda stated that as a result of the imperialists' preparation for war, the living standards of the working people in capitalist and colonial countries are continuously deteriorating. Only in those countries that have eliminated capitalist exploitation and pursue a policy of peace can the living standards of the people be continuously improved. The Council notes with satisfaction the steady development of the national economies and the improvement of the welfare of the working people in the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the People's Democracies, and the German Democratic Republic. The achievements of the socialist and democratic camps in peaceful construction labor strengthen the cause of world peace and increase the strength and confidence of the working people in capitalist countries and colonial dependencies. The resolution calls for strengthening the unity of action of the working people, more broadly developing activities among workers and staff, promoting the experience of the struggle of the working people of all countries, opposing sectarianism, more effectively supporting the workers' struggle, and developing the international solidarity movement. The resolution concludes by urging all working people to unite their ranks more closely in the struggle, strive to improve the status of the working masses, oppose the expansion of the arms race, and oppose the danger of a new world war.

　　The letter to the working people of the world adopted by the meeting points out that the World Federation of Trade Unions bears a great responsibility for the fate of mankind, and therefore calls on trade union activists of various opinions to unite and fight together for full employment, increased wages, and improved social legislation. The letter to the working people of the world also calls on the working people to intensify their struggle to defend trade union rights and democratic freedoms, and to defend peace.

　　World Federation of Trade Unions Chairman Vittorio announced at the closing meeting that the Council meeting had received more than two thousand congratulatory telegrams from trade union groups and political leaders in various countries, all of whom warmly congratulated the meeting on its success.

　　Furthermore, thousands of working people in Berlin held a joint rally with World Federation of Trade Unions leaders on the 20th. The meeting unanimously passed a resolution guaranteeing to strive to implement the resolutions of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council meeting and to strengthen the unity of the working class in the struggle for peace and its own rights.

　　世界工联理事会会议胜利闭幕      
    拥护世界和平理事会关于停止扩军的呼吁       
    号召各国工会广泛团结劳动人民保卫和平
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：世界工会联合会理事会柏林会议已在二十一日胜利闭幕。会议就议程第一项关于“世界工联工作”的报告和议程第二项关于“劳动人民在争取改善生活条件、反对备战政策的经济和社会后果的斗争中的团结”的报告分别通过了决议，并通过了告全世界劳动人民书。会议一致批准了审计委员会的报告，并就社会保险、保卫西班牙巴塞罗那被捕的三十四个工人、关于希腊、伊朗和西德的形势、关于委内瑞拉、智利和哥伦比亚工会运动者遭受迫害等问题通过了决议。会议决定把世界工联的上述决议送交联合国考虑。会议表示世界工联拥护世界和平理事会维也纳会议提出的要求停止扩张军备运动的呼吁；并决定重新提出建议，要求所谓“国际自由工会联合会”为保卫劳动人民的生活水准采取一致行动。
    会议就议程第一项通过的决议说：尽管帝国主义者及其潜伏在工会运动中的爪牙们疯狂地反对世界工联，但是世界工联的影响仍在继续扩大，它的会员人数继续增加，现在已经超过了八千万人。决议号召加强各国工会活动，不分政治、宗教信仰和所属工会，团结各国劳动人民，为争取较好的劳动和生活条件、为保卫和平而斗争。
    会议就议程第二项通过的决议说：由于帝国主义者准备战争的结果，资本主义国家和殖民地国家劳动人民的生活水准正在不断地恶化。只有在那些消灭了资本主义剥削和奉行和平政策的国家，人民大众的生活水准才能不断地提高。理事会满意地注意到苏联、中华人民共和国、各人民民主国家和德意志民主共和国国民经济的稳步发展以及劳动人民福利的增进。社会主义和民主阵营各国在和平建设劳动方面的成就，加强了世界和平的事业，增加了资本主义国家和殖民地附属国劳动人民的力量和信心。决议号召加强劳动人民在行动上的团结一致，更广泛地展开在工人和职员中的活动，推广各国劳动人民的斗争经验，反对宗派主义，更有效地支持工人的斗争，并发展国际团结运动。决议最后敦促全体劳动人民在斗争中更紧密地团结自己的队伍，争取改善劳动大众的地位，反对扩张军备运动，反对新世界大战的危险。
    会议通过的告全世界劳动人民书指出：世界工联对人类的命运负有很大的责任，因此号召各种不同见解的工会运动者团结起来，共同奋斗，争取充分就业、增加工资、改善社会立法等。告全世界劳动人民书并号召劳动人民为保卫工会权利和民主自由、为保卫和平而加紧斗争。
    世界工联主席维多里奥在闭幕会议上宣布，理事会会议收到各国工会团体和政治领袖的贺电两千多件，他们都热烈地祝贺会议的成功。
    又讯：柏林劳动人民数千人曾在二十日和世界工联领袖联合举行大会。会上一致通过决议，保证为实现世界工联理事会会议的决议、加强工人阶级在争取和平和自己的权利的斗争中的团结而奋斗。
