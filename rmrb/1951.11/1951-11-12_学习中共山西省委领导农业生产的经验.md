    Learning from the CCP Shanxi Provincial Committee's Experience in Leading Agricultural Production

    The experience of the CCP Shanxi Provincial Committee in leading the autumn Patriotic Production Increase Movement shows that, for local Party committees to strengthen their political and ideological leadership over production work, they must struggle against all erroneous ideas in agricultural production leadership and guide agricultural production in the correct direction. Therefore, Party leading organs must closely observe the characteristics of each period of the agricultural production movement, as well as the ideological conditions of cadres and the masses, analyze and study them, identify the main problems, and formulate solutions. After discovering the erroneous idea among cadres of opposing the task of political struggle to doing a good job in agricultural production, the Shanxi Provincial Committee immediately concentrated its efforts, widely used various organizational forms such as People's Representative Conferences, and formed a large-scale propaganda team to launch a struggle against erroneous ideas in agricultural production leadership. This raised the ideological level of cadres and the masses, ensured the continued advancement of the autumn production increase movement, overfulfilled the agricultural production tasks, and produced examples of increasing yield per unit area in the movement. However, in some places, there still exists another situation, which is neglecting the systematic leadership of the Patriotic Production Increase Movement. Some Party leading organs are trapped in the quagmire of bureaucracy all day long, entangled in trivial issues, failing to grasp the situation, analyze problems, and find the main problems in their work; or, having identified the main problems, they fail to concentrate their efforts to solve them. As a result, political and ideological leadership completely falls through. This situation should be changed.

    学习中共山西省委领导农业生产的经验
    中共山西省委领导秋季爱国丰产运动的经验说明，地方党委要加强对生产工作的政治领导和思想领导，就必须和在农业生产领导中的一切错误思想进行斗争，引导农业生产向正确的方向发展。因此党的领导机关必须密切注视每一时期农业生产运动的特点以及干部、群众的思想情况，加以分析研究，找出主要问题，定出解决问题的办法。山西省委在发现了干部将政治斗争任务和作好农业生产工作对立起来的错误思想后，当即集中力量，广泛地运用人民代表会议等各种组织形式，并组成了规模很大的宣传队伍，向农业生产领导上的错误思想展开了斗争，从而提高了干部、群众的思想水平，保证了秋季丰产运动的继续前进，超额完成了农业生产的任务，并在运动中出现了提高单位面积产量的榜样。但是，有些地方现在还存在着另外一种情况，这就是忽视对爱国丰产运动的系统领导，某些党的领导机关整天陷在事务主义的泥坑里，纠缠于枝节问题，不掌握情况，分析问题，找不到工作中的主要问题；或者找出了主要问题而不能集中力量加以解决，其结果使政治领导和思想领导也就完全落空。这种情况是应该加以改变的。
