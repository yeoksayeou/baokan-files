　　It is essential to do a good job in the work of employees' families
    The work of employees' families is an important component of trade union work. The number of organized employees' families nationwide has reached over 1.6 million. They have played an extremely important role in guaranteeing the completion of production tasks by employees, supporting the front lines, responding to various government calls, safeguarding factory and mine safety production, and carrying out mass mutual assistance. However, the employees' families that have already been organized still only account for a small portion of the total number of employees' families. If all employees' families nationwide are organized, they will inevitably play an even greater role.

    For those employees' families that have not yet been organized, the experience of advanced areas should be absorbed to organize them; for those employees' families that have already been organized, they should be further consolidated and improved on the existing basis. Through revising and inspecting the patriotic pact movement, strengthen their patriotic education, promote unity and mutual assistance, diligence and hygiene, cultural learning, participation in democratic political construction, improvement of family life and living environment, in order to cooperate with the factory's production increase and economy campaign.

    For this purpose, it is necessary to correct the erroneous thinking of some cadres who do not pay attention to the work of employees' families, or underestimate the strength of the masses of families when organized; it is necessary to implement the spirit of the "Instructions on the Work of Employees' Families" issued by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on November 14, 1950, conscientiously regard the work of employees' families as an important component of the entire trade union work, strengthen the leadership of the work of employees' families, promptly study, summarize and promote the advanced experience of the work of employees' families, and do a good job in the work of employees' families nationwide!

　　一定要作好职工家属工作
    职工家属工作，是工会工作的重要组成部分。全国组织起来的职工家属，已达一百六十多万人。她们在保证职工完成生产任务、支援前线、响应政府各项号召、保卫厂矿安全生产、开展群众互助等各方面，都发挥了极其重要的作用。但是，已经组织起来的职工家属，还只占整个职工家属的很少的一部分。如果把全国职工家属统通组织起来，必然会发挥更大的作用。
    对于尚未组织的职工家属，应该吸收先进地区经验，把她们组织起来；对于已经组织起来的职工家属，要在现有的基础上，进一步地加以巩固和提高，通过修订与检查爱国公约运动，加强对她们的爱国主义教育，提倡团结互助、勤劳卫生、学习文化、参加民主建政工作、改进家庭生活和居住环境、来配合工厂的增产节约运动。
    为了这个目的，必须纠正某些干部不重视职工家属工作，或低估家属群众组织起来的力量的错误思想；必须贯彻中华全国总工会一九五○年十一月十四日发布的职工家属工作指示的精神，认真把职工家属工作当成整个工会工作的重要组成部分，加强对职工家属工作的领导，及时研究、总结和推广职工家属工作的先进经验，在全国范围内，作好职工家属工作！
