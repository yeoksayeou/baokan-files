All-China Federation of Trade Unions Sends Congratulatory Telegram to the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions:
    On the occasion of the thirty-fourth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, on behalf of the Chinese working people, I extend warm congratulations to the entire Soviet working people, and wish the Soviet working class, under the leadership of the great teacher Marshal Stalin and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, greater achievements in the great cause of building a communist society and defending world peace. The Chinese working class is taking the Soviet working class as an example, striving to increase production and practice thrift to build our own country, and is carrying out the struggle to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our homes and country, so as to follow the Soviet working class in striving for the victory of lasting world peace.
