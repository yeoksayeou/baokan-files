Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 10th: In order to eliminate the malicious misinterpretations by the U.S. side of our proposal on November 7th for an on-the-spot ceasefire and to accelerate the progress of the ceasefire negotiations, our representatives put forward the following clear proposals and specific statements at the subcommittee meeting on November 10th (see appendix). Our representatives pointed out that our proposal is not only the only reasonable answer to the second item on the agenda, but the specific measures we have proposed can also enable the delegation assembly to immediately enter into the discussion of the third item on the agenda after adopting our proposal. However, the U.S. representatives once again proposed not making any specific decisions on the second item on the agenda, attempting to cancel the second item on the agenda, so that the subcommittee meeting on November 10th still failed to achieve any progress.
Appendix:
Our proposal on November 10th:
The Korean-Chinese representatives of the subcommittee formally propose that the subcommittee adopt the following suggestions:
(1) Determine the principle of using the actual line of contact between the two sides as the military demarcation line, and withdrawing two kilometers from each side of this line to establish a demilitarized zone.
(2) The subcommittee should immediately correct the existing actual line of contact based on the above principle to determine the existing actual line of contact agreed by both sides as the military demarcation line, and accordingly determine the lines two kilometers on each side of the military demarcation line as the north and south lines of the demilitarized zone, and delineate the demilitarized zone.
(3) After the entire armistice agreement is agreed upon, but before it is signed, the subcommittee must make corresponding modifications to the aforementioned military demarcation line and demilitarized zone in accordance with the changes that occur in the actual line of contact between the two sides at that time.
The Korean-Chinese representatives of the subcommittee specifically suggest that after the subcommittee adopts the above three resolutions, it should submit a report to the assembly and recommend that the assembly immediately enter into the discussion of the third item on the agenda, while entrusting the specific work of correcting the existing actual line of contact to determine the existing actual line of contact agreed by both sides as the military demarcation line and delineating the demilitarized zone accordingly to the subcommittee to be carried out simultaneously.
Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 9th: At the subcommittee meeting on November 9th, our representatives continued to refute the absurd assertion made by the U.S. side that if it does not agree to adjust the Kaesong area to U.S. control, it will fundamentally overturn the second item on the agenda. Our representatives pointed out that our proposal on November 7th clearly stipulates that the currently determined military demarcation line and demilitarized zone will be corrected accordingly according to the actual changes in the line of contact before the entire armistice agreement is agreed upon but not yet signed. The U.S. side no longer has any excuse to object. A specific decision should now be made on the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone based on the principle of withdrawing two kilometers from each side of the existing actual line of contact. The vast peace-loving people of the world will never allow the U.S. side to insist on its absurd demand to occupy Kaesong, at the expense of making the entire ceasefire negotiations fall into a deadlock due to its unreasonable attitude.

### 美方仍拒绝采纳我新建议  十日小组委员会会议未获任何进展

　　美方仍拒绝采纳我新建议
    十日小组委员会会议未获任何进展
    【新华社开城十日电】为扫除美方对我方十一月七日的就地停战建议所作的恶意曲解和加速停战谈判的进行，我方代表在十一月十日的小组委员会提出了以下的明确建议和具体声明（见附件）。我方代表指出我方的建议不仅是解决第二项议程唯一合理的答案，而且我方提出的具体办法也可以使代表团大会在通过我方建议后立即进入第三项议程的讨论。但美方代表却又再度提出了对第二项议程不作任何具体决定，企图取消第二项议程的建议，以致十一月十日的小组会议仍然未能获得任何进展。
    附件：
    我方十一月十日提案：
    小组委员会朝中代表正式提议小组委员会通过下列建议：
    （一）确定以双方实际接触线为军事分界线，并由此线各退二公里，以建立非军事地区的原则。
    （二）小组委员会应即根据上项原则校正现有实际接触线，以确定双方同意的现有实际接触线为军事分界线，并由此确定军事分界线两侧各二公里之线为非军事区的南北线，划出非军事地区。
    （三）小组委员会在停战协议全部商定后，但尚未签字前，必须按照双方实际接触线届时所发生的变化，对上述军事分界线与非军事区作相应的修改。
    小组委员会朝中代表并具体建议小组委员会于通过上述三项决议后，即向大会提出报告，并建议大会立即进入第三项议程的讨论，而将校正现有实际接触线，以确定双方同意的现有实际接触线为军事分界线并据此划定非军事区的具体工作，交由小组委员会同时进行。
    【新华社开城九日电】十一月九日的小组委员会上，我方代表继续驳斥美方所提出的若不同意将开城地区调整到美方控制之下就根本推翻第二项议程的荒谬主张。我方代表指出：我方十一月七日的提议中明白规定，现在确定的军事分界线及非军事区，在停战协议全部商定而尚未签字前，将按照接触线所发生的实际变化作相应的修正，美方已经没有任何藉口反对。现在即应根据现有实际接触线各退二公里的原则，对军事分界线及非军事区作出具体决定。全世界广大的爱好和平的人民决不容许美方为了坚持占有开城的荒谬要求，而不惜使整个停战谈判陷于僵局的无理态度。
