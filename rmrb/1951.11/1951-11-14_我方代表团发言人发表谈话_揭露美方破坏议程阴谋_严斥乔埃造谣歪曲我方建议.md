Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 13th. After our side's representatives formally presented four proposals in the subcommittee, General Joy, the chief representative of the US delegation, in his statement on November 11, still spread rumors and slanders, saying that our side wanted to immediately and unchangeably determine the demilitarized zone in order to delay the armistice negotiations. A reporter specifically interviewed the spokesman of our delegation regarding General Joy's deliberate distortion of facts and reversal of right and wrong, and received the following statement:

The position and stance of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation regarding the second item on the armistice negotiation agenda are absolutely fair and reasonable and cannot be distorted in any way. The second item on the armistice negotiation agenda clearly stipulates: "As a basic condition for the cessation of hostile actions in Korea, determine the military demarcation line between the two sides to establish a demilitarized zone." According to this provision, our side's representatives in the subcommittee formally proposed on November 10 the principle of determining the actual line of contact as the military demarcation line, with each side withdrawing two kilometers to establish a demilitarized zone (first proposal), and immediately correcting the existing actual line of contact to specifically determine the military demarcation line and thereby determine the northern and southern edges of the demilitarized zone (second proposal); however, considering that the actual line of contact between the two sides may have some changes when all agenda items are agreed upon, and the other party has repeatedly insisted during the negotiation process that changes in the line of contact before the signing of the agreement must be reflected in the military demarcation line, our proposal also clearly stipulates: the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone may be correspondingly revised according to the changes that occur in the actual line of contact at that time (third proposal). From this, it can be seen that our proposal absolutely does not, as General Joy distorted, require the immediate and unchangeable determination of the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone. General Joy's accusation that our side is attempting to delay the negotiations is even more slanderous and groundless. On the contrary, in order to realize the peace aspirations of the people of the world and first allow the participating soldiers to return home as soon as possible, our side has consistently advocated that both sides should strive to reach agreements on other agenda items as quickly as possible. To this end, our side specifically suggested that as long as the United Nations Command side of the subcommittee agrees to our above-mentioned absolutely fair and reasonable three proposals, the subcommittee can immediately submit a report to the plenary session, and recommend that the plenary session immediately enter into the discussion of other agenda items after passing the above-mentioned three resolutions, while entrusting the subcommittee to carry out the work of correcting the existing actual line of contact to determine the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone simultaneously. We believe that as long as both sides have the sincerity to reach an armistice and do not deliberately create difficulties in the negotiation process, it will not be difficult to quickly reach agreements on the discussion of other agenda items. This is the main thrust of the four proposals put forward by our side at the subcommittee meeting on November 10, which cannot be opposed or distorted by anyone who wants to see the early realization of an armistice in Korea. General Joy insists on distorting our un-distortable proposals, the purpose of which is to oppose our fair and reasonable proposals that they cannot find any reason to oppose, and to defend their ulterior and sinister conspiracy to attempt to overturn the clear provisions of the second agenda item on determining the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone, delay the armistice negotiations, and even ultimately sabotage the entire armistice negotiations. The United Nations Command delegation cannot but verbally acknowledge the correctness of the principle of on-the-spot ceasefire and withdrawal of two kilometers by each side proposed by our side, but desperately opposes the determination of the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone now. In the formal proposal submitted at the subcommittee meeting on November 11, they specifically proposed that the determination of the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone be left until before the signing of the armistice agreement, which is obviously a direct violation of the clear provisions of the second agenda item. It is impossible for the United Nations Command delegation, especially General Joy, not to understand the clear provisions of the second agenda item. Since the discussion of the second agenda item began in July this year, the United Nations Command delegation has put forward a series of military demarcation line and demilitarized zone proposals, the proposal on July 27 to penetrate deep into our positions, the proposal on October 25 to occupy our Kaesong area, and the proposal on November 8 to forcibly demilitarize Kaesong. All of these proposals are specific proposals to determine the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone. Only when our side put forward the absolutely fair and reasonable principle of an on-the-spot ceasefire and withdrawal of two kilometers by each side, making it impossible for the other side to oppose, did the United Nations Command side begin to oppose the specific determination of the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone now. Therefore, it is very clear that the pattern of action of the United Nations Command delegation on this issue is that when the military demarcation line and demilitarized zone proposal is unilaterally beneficial to them, they approve of specifically determining it; when this proposal is fair and reasonable to both sides and they cannot obtain unilateral benefits from it, but cannot openly oppose it, they oppose specifically determining it. It is incomprehensible that since the United Nations Command delegation cannot oppose the absolute fairness of using the actual line of contact between the two sides as the military demarcation line, thereby verbally acknowledging it and even suggesting the establishment of a staff group to accurately correct the line of contact between the two sides, then why not specifically determine the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone now, when the second agenda item clearly requires the two sides to determine the military demarcation line, but instead have to wait until before the signing of the armistice agreement to determine the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone? This is not only a clear violation of the provisions of the second agenda item, but simply a fundamental overthrow of the second agenda item, and the abolition of the basic conditions for the cessation of all hostile acts in Korea. At the same time, the proposal to establish a staff group to accurately correct the line of contact between the two sides has also become empty talk, devoid of practical significance. The United Nations Command delegation insists on doing so, and there is no other reason to explain it except to achieve their ulterior motives. In fact, the actual purpose pursued by the United Nations Command is not difficult to unravel. From the first time the United Nations Command put forward their absurd and arrogant military demarcation line proposal to penetrate deep into our positions on July 27, until they put forward the military demarcation line proposal to forcibly neutralize Kaesong on November 8, the United Nations Command delegation has never given up on obtaining through negotiations what they have failed to obtain on the battlefield. But all these arrogant attempts have gone bankrupt in the face of the firm stance of the Korean-Chinese delegation, and have continued to go bankrupt until they can no longer oppose the absolute fairness of the on-the-spot ceasefire principle put forward by the Korean-Chinese delegation. Therefore, driven to desperation, they do not hesitate to openly sabotage the procedures of the armistice negotiations, and refuse to immediately determine the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone, so that when their unilateral demands cannot be met, they fundamentally refuse to determine the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone, so that the entire armistice negotiations can be declared a failure even in the last five minutes. General Joy, in his capacity as the chief representative of the United Nations Command for armistice negotiations, actually openly advocates opposing the immediate determination of the military demarcation line in order to maintain his so-called absurd idea of ​​military pressure, and his sincerity in the negotiations is highly questionable. If the United Nations Command side still has the slightest sincerity in the negotiations, they should immediately order the United Nations Command delegation to stop this method of deception, intimidation, procrastination, and extortion, and quickly reach a complete agreement on the armistice negotiations on a basis that both sides can agree to, first of all, to reach an agreement on the second agenda item on the basis of our four proposals. Otherwise, their conspiracy to delay and sabotage the armistice negotiations will be difficult to escape the condemnation of the people of the world.

　　我方代表团发言人发表谈话
    揭露美方破坏议程阴谋
    严斥乔埃造谣歪曲我方建议
     【新华社开城十三日电】在小组委员会上我方代表正式提出四项建议之后，美方代表团首席代表乔埃将军在十一月十一日的谈话里却仍然造谣诬蔑说，我方要立即一成不变地确定非军事区，以便拖延停战谈判。记者特就乔埃将军这一有意歪曲事实颠倒是非的谈话访问我方代表团发言人，承发表谈话如下：朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团对于停战谈判第二项议程的立场和主张，是绝对公平合理不容任何曲解的。停战谈判的第二项议程明白规定：“作为在朝鲜停止敌对行为的基本条件，确定双方军事分界线，以建立非军事地区。”根据这一规定，小组会我方代表在十一月十日正式提议，确定以实际接触线为军事分界线，双方各退二公里，以建立非军事区的原则（第一项提议），并立即校正现有实际接触线，以具体确定军事分界线，并据此确定非军事区的南北缘（第二项提议）；但鉴于等到各项议程都达成协议时，双方实际接触线可能有某些变动，而对方在谈判过程中又一再坚持协议签字前接触线上的变化必须反映在军事分界线上，我方建议也明确规定：军事分界线和非军事区届时可按实际接触线所发生的变化予以相应的修正（第三项提议）。由此可见，我方建议绝没有像乔埃将军所曲解的要求立即一成不变地确定军事分界线和非军事区。乔埃将军诬称我方企图拖延谈判，更是含血喷人，毫无根据。正好相反，为实现世界人民的和平愿望，首先使参战士兵们早日回家，我方一贯主张双方应该努力使其他各项议程迅速达成协议。为此，我方又具体建议只要小组会联合国军方面同意我们上述绝对公平合理的三项建议，小组会立即可向大会提出报告，并建议大会在通过上述三项决议后立即进入其他议程的讨论，而将校正现有实际接触线以确定军事分界线和非军事区的工作交给小组会同时进行。我们相信只要双方具有达成停战的诚意，不故意在谈判过程中制造困难，对于其他各项议程的讨论是不难迅速达成协议的。这是我方在十一月十日小组会上提出的四项建议的主旨，是任何愿意看到朝鲜停战早日实现的人所不能反对，也无从曲解的。乔埃将军执意曲解我方不可曲解的建议，其目的是在于反对他们找不出任何理由来反对的我方公平合理的主张，为他们企图推翻第二项议程所明白规定的确定军事分界线和非军事区，拖延停战谈判的进行，并不惜最后破坏整个停战谈判的不可告人的丑恶阴谋作辩护。联合国军代表团口头上已不能不承认我方提出的就地停战各退二公里的原则的正确性，但拚命反对现在确定军事分界线和非军事区。他们在十一月十一日小组会上正式建议中具体提议将军事分界线和非军事区的确定留待停战协议签字之前，这显然是直接违反第二项议程的明白规定的。联合国军代表团特别是乔埃将军是不可能不了解第二项议程的明白规定的。自从今年七月开始讨论第二项议程以来，联合国军代表团曾经提出一系列军事分界线和非军事区方案，七月二十七日的深入我方阵地的方案，十月二十五日侵占我方开城地区的方案，十一月八日强使开城非军事化的方案，所有这些方案都是具体确定军事分界线和非军事区的方案。只有当我方提出就地停战各退二公里绝对公平合理的原则使对方无从反对时，联合国军方面才开始反对现在就具体确定军事分界线和非军事区。因此很明白，联合国军代表团在这个问题上的行动规律，是当军事分界线和非军事区的方案对他们片面有利时，他们就赞成具体确定它；当这个方案是对双方公平合理他们不能从中取得片面利益而又不能公开反对时，他们就反对具体确定它。令人不可理解的是联合国军代表团既然不能反对以双方的实际接触线为军事分界线的绝对公平性，从而口头上不能不承认它甚而至于建议成立参谋团来精确校正双方接触线，那么为什么不在现在第二项议程中明白规定要求双方确定军事分界线的时候就来具体确定军事分界线和非军事区，而必须要等到停战协议签字以前才确定军事分界线和非军事区呢？这不仅是显然违反第二项议程的规定，而简直是根本推翻第二项议程，取消在朝鲜停止一切敌对行为的基本条件。同时，成立参谋团来精确校正双方接触线的建议，也成为欺人的空谈，毫无实际意义。联合国军代表团坚持这样做，除掉是为了达到他们不可告人的目的而外，是没有其他理由可以解释的。其实联合国军所追求的实际目的，是不难索解的，从七月二十七日联合国军第一次提出他们那个深入我方阵地的荒谬狂妄的军事分界线方案起，一直到十一月八日他们提出强使开城中立化的军事分界线方案止，联合国军代表团从来没有放弃过通过谈判取得他们在战场上所未能取得的东西。但所有这些狂妄的企图在朝中代表团的坚定立场前面破产了，一直破产到他们不能再反对朝中代表团所提出的就地停战原则的绝对公平性。于是狗急跳墙，他们是不惜公然破坏停战谈判的程序，拒绝即行确定军事分界线和非军事区，以便于在他们单方面的要求不能得到满足的时候，根本拒绝确定军事分界线和非军事区，使整个停战谈判在最后五分钟也能宣告失败。乔埃将军以联合国军停战谈判的首席代表的身份竟公然鼓吹反对即行确定军事分界线，以保持其所谓军事压力的荒谬主张，其对于谈判的诚意，至可怀疑。假使联合国军方面还有丝毫谈判的诚意，就应该立即命令联合国军代表团停止这种欺骗、恐吓、拖延和讹诈的办法，在双方可以同意的基础上迅速达成停战谈判的全部协议，首先是在我方四项建议的基础上达成第二项议程的协议。否则，他们拖延和破坏停战谈判的阴谋，将难于逃脱世界人民的谴责。
