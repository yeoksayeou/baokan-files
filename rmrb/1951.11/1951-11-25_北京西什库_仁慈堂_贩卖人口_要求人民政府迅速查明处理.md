    Beijing Xishiku "Ren Ci Tang" Trafficking in People
    Demanding that the People's Government Rapidly Investigate and Deal with It
    I now want to expose the crime of the Beijing Xishiku "Ren Ci Tang" [Benevolence Hall] of selling people. The Xishiku "Ren Ci Tang" has a history of several decades. The hall is called "Benevolence," and it takes in children, but in reality, it exploits child labor and sells the children to places outside of Beijing after they grow up. In 1933, my eldest daughter, Bai Shuqin, was sent to the hall at the age of eleven because she lost her mother. In 1939, without notifying the parents, the hall had Father Li take Shuqin to Anci County, Hebei Province, to sell her, twice in succession. Finally, Shuqin ended up in the home of Zhang Wanyi in Zhuguantun, Anci County, nominally as husband and wife, but actually as a domestic slave. Her correspondence was opened and replied to by the local priest. Before liberation, I sued in the puppet court and reported it to Anci County, but to no avail.
    Now it is the world of the people. I demand that the People's Government rapidly investigate and deal with the crimes of the Xishiku "Ren Ci Tang" in trafficking people and abusing children, and punish those human traffickers with the punishment they deserve.

    北京西什库“仁慈堂”贩卖人口
    要求人民政府迅速查明处理
    我现在要揭发北京西什库“仁慈堂”出卖人口的罪行。西什库“仁慈堂”已有数十年之久的历史。该堂名为“仁慈”，收容儿童，实则剥削儿童劳动力，并在儿童长大之后被弄到北京以外的地方出卖掉。一九三三年，我的长女白淑琴，十一岁，因丧母被送入该堂。一九三九年，该堂并未通知家长，即由李神甫将淑琴带到河北省安次县出卖，先后两次。最后，淑琴落在安次县朱官屯张万义家，名义上是夫妇，实际上是家奴。她的来往信件，由当地神甫代拆代复。解放以前我曾向伪法院控诉，向安次县告发，但都没有结果。
    现在是人民的天下了，我要求人民政府迅速对贩卖人口、虐害儿童的西什库“仁慈堂”的罪行查明处理，并对那些贩卖人口的人贩子治以应得之罪。
