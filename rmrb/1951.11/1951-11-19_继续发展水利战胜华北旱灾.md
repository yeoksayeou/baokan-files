Developing agricultural water conservancy is the most effective way to combat drought and increase yield per unit area.
　　
North China is arid in the spring, with rainfall concentrated in July and August, often experiencing drought followed by flooding, posing a significant threat to agricultural production. The average annual rainfall in North China is about 400 to 600 millimeters, but because the rainfall is too concentrated and untimely, it is far from meeting the needs of farmland. Therefore, there is a popular saying in North China: "Nine out of ten years are drought years." The drought in North China was relatively severe two years ago, and some areas suffered drought again this year, with Chahar and Suiyuan provinces being the most severely affected.
　　
Over the past two years, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the people of North China have waged a serious struggle against drought. The five provinces of North China have newly dug 90,000 wells, added 140,000 waterwheels, and built 30 large-scale canals and 4,000 small-scale canals, which have played a very important role in combating drought and increasing production. These achievements are only preliminary. The total irrigated area in North China is still less than one-tenth of the cultivated land area. Therefore, the people of North China have not yet escaped the threat of drought. To overcome drought, much more work needs to be done.
　　
There are two sources of irrigation water in North China: surface water, mainly rivers, and groundwater - wells. Due to the influence of climate and terrain, the difference between the average flow and flood flow of rivers in North China is very large. Large-scale water storage projects must be carried out to maximize their effectiveness. Except for Suiyuan, which can use natural rivers to irrigate most of its farmland, the remaining provinces in North China cannot solve the irrigation problem by relying solely on the water volume of rivers. Therefore, wells have become the main source of water in North China. For example, in Hebei, 80 percent of the paddy fields are irrigated with well water. The water yield of most wells in Pingyuan Province cannot keep up with the water extraction of waterwheels. It is necessary to drill holes at the bottom of the well and install bamboo pipes to draw water from the lower aquifers (hereinafter referred to as lower aquifers, generally one or two hundred feet below the bottom of the well) to obtain sufficient water. In the past two years, well water irrigation has developed rapidly in Pingyuan Province. Chahar Province has learned from this year's drought and is also preparing to vigorously launch a well-drilling campaign. Therefore, developing well water irrigation is the main way to solve drought in North China. Of course, where canal irrigation conditions exist, canal irrigation should be developed as much as possible.
　　
1. How to Develop Water Wells and Waterwheels?
　　
Educating and organizing the masses is the primary task in developing water well and waterwheel irrigation.
　　
In areas without irrigation habits, the masses do not know the benefits of irrigating to increase production, and are mostly unwilling to invest in well digging. In these areas, typical demonstration methods should be used to first reasonably utilize old wells and organize activists to install waterwheels. And use calculation methods to make the masses understand the role of changing dry land into irrigated land in increasing production, and prepare a ideological foundation for the well-digging movement.
　　
In areas with irrigation habits, the masses already recognize the increase in production from irrigation. However, because the land is scattered, it is not cost-effective for one household to dig a well, or because of small capital, they cannot afford to dig one, so some farmers would rather grow dry land. Hebei and Pingyuan provinces have made many achievements and gained experience in launching neighborhood mutual aid to dig wells and buy waterwheels together. Daming County organizes well-digging mutual aid societies to solve funding problems, and organizes well-digging mutual aid groups to solve the problem of neighbors digging and irrigating together, which are good ways to promote joint well-digging and waterwheel purchase. Stipulating the price of well water for sale can also promote the development of waterwheels and water wells. Launching the masses to formulate water conservation conventions to expand the irrigation area of existing wells, so that each well can irrigate 30 to 50 mu of land, is also a good way.
　　
Some people are worried about quicksand, poor water quality, or low water volume when digging wells, or are worried about the poor technology of technicians, and are unwilling to try easily. Several special districts in Pingyuan Province have run training classes for digging wells to tap lower aquifers, with very good results. Some local people's governments in the province have hired well-drilling technicians with excellent performance to regularly work in various places and promote good technology, which has played a great role. Tangyin County in Pingyuan Province uses well-drilling loans, and banks, well-drilling households, and kiln households sign contracts, with kiln households using the funds and well-drilling households repaying, which is a very good method. The production of waterwheels should be planned and prepared early, not only making annual plans, but also making monthly procurement and production plans. Last year, several private waterwheel factories in Hebei Province were forced to shut down due to lack of work, which was the result of poor planning.
　　
2. How to Develop Canal Irrigation?
　　
The old canal management organizations controlled by feudal forces have basically been destroyed in North China. Some areas have established unified organizations with river systems as units. To manage canals well, first, democracy must be promoted, and second, institutions must be improved. Although the organizational forms of various places are different, they have developed in a democratic direction. There should be sufficient cadres in the canal management organization to be responsible for collecting water fees and maintaining repairs, and to control the allocation of water. Increasing the number of working cadres certainly increases expenses, but compared with the benefits of expanding the irrigation area, this expense is very small. The masses in the old irrigation areas have developed the habit of wasting water. Once restrictions are imposed, it is easy to cause resentment. It is necessary to conduct long-term patriotic education on saving water, and make them realize that watering more water will not only not increase production, but will reduce production and damage soil quality.
　　
In order to control and plan the allocation of water, it is necessary to: 1. Establish structures that can manipulate the amount of water; 2. Grasp the actual irrigated area; 3. Grasp the water demand time and water demand of crops. The structures must be permanent, with water diversion gates built at the mouths of branch canals, bucket gates built at the mouths of bucket canals, and iron locks configured when necessary. The irrigation area of the Guangji Canal in Pingyuan Province was only 95,000 mu in 1949. After improvement, it has increased to 240,000 mu in 1950. It can be seen that the improvement of the engineering and management of old canals is very important. The water demand time and water demand of crops vary from place to place, and more reliable conclusions can only be drawn after testing. Hebei and Pingyuan provinces only irrigate an average of about 10,000 mu of land per cubic meter of water per second, which is undoubtedly a great waste. If rational control is carried out, it is not a problem to expand to 30,000 mu in cotton and wheat areas.
　　
Medium and small-sized canals are easier to build, and these canals should be developed as much as possible at present. Mobilize the masses in mountainous areas to build small ponds and dams, and dig reservoirs to store water. On the one hand, they can intercept floods and block sand, and on the other hand, they can store water for irrigation. Water resources in North China are insufficient, and every drop of water in the river is precious, so more reservoirs should be built. The engineering planning of major river systems should begin now.
　　
In North China, in addition to developing water conservancy to prevent drought, we must also rely on various drought-resistant and drought-resistant cultivation methods, and promptly mobilize the masses to cultivate, hoe, rake, and roll to maintain moisture in the soil. This spring, Chairman Yang Xiufeng of Hebei Province and Deputy Chairman Luo Yuchuan of Pingyuan Province led a large number of cadres to the countryside to mobilize the masses to resist drought and plant cotton. Not only did they complete but also exceeded the originally planned cotton planting area, with great results. It is very important to cultivate the cultivation habits of the broad masses of people to prevent and resist drought.

　　继续发展水利战胜华北旱灾
    刘宗耀
    发展农田水利，是战胜旱灾，提高单位面积产量的最有效的办法。
    华北春季亢旱，雨量多集中在七、八月间，常常先旱后涝，对农业生产的威胁很大。华北区每年平均雨量约为四○○至六○○公厘，因为落雨的时间太集中，不及时，远不能满足农田的需要。所以在华北有一句很流行的话：“十年九旱”。华北区前年的旱灾较严重，今年若干地区又患旱灾，而以察哈尔、绥远两省为最重。
    两年以来，华北人民在共产党和人民政府领导下，和旱灾进行了严重的斗争。华北五省新凿水井九万眼，添置水车十四万辆，修建大型渠道三○处，小型渠道四千处，这对战胜旱灾，提高产量，起了很重要的作用。这些成绩还只是初步的，全华北的灌溉面积，现在还不到耕地面积的十分之一，因此，华北人民还摆脱不开旱灾的威胁。为了战胜旱灾，还需要做很多工作。
    华北区灌溉的水源有两种，一种是地面水，主要是河流；一种是地下水——水井。华北的河流，因为受气候和地势的影响，平均流量与洪水流量相差很远，必须进行大规模的蓄水工程，才能发挥最大效用。华北五省，除绥远可以利用天然河流灌溉该省大部农田以外，其余各省，单靠河流的水量，解决不了灌溉问题。因此，水井在华北成了主要的水源。例如河北，百分之八十的水田是用井水灌溉的。平原省大部水井的出水量，赶不上水车的汲取量，必须在井底钻孔安置竹管，引取下层水泉（以下简称下泉，一般下泉在井底以下一、二十丈），才可得到足用的水量。两年以来，井水灌溉在平原省发展得很快。察哈尔省接受了今年旱灾的教训，亦准备大力开展打井运动。因此，发展水井灌溉，是解决华北干旱的主要方法。当然在有渠道灌溉条件的地方，也应该尽可能地发展渠道灌溉。
    一、如何发展水井水车？
    教育群众，组织群众，是发展水井水车灌溉的首要工作。
    在没有灌溉习惯的地区，群众还不知道浇地增产的好处，多不肯投资打井。在这些地区，应该用典型示范的办法，首先合理地运用旧井，组织积极分子安置水车。并用算账办法，使群众了解变旱地为水地，对提高产量所起的作用，给打井运动准备思想基础。
    在有灌溉习惯的地区，群众对浇地增产已有认识。但因土地分散，一户打井不合算，或因资力小打不起，所以有些农民宁可种旱地。河北、平原两省发动地邻互助打井，伙买水车，已有很多成绩和经验。大名县组织打井互助社以解决资金问题，组织打井互助会以解决地邻伙打伙浇问题，都是推动合伙打井买水车的好办法。规定井水出卖价格，亦可促进水车水井的发展。发动群众制订使水公约，扩大已有水井的灌溉面积，使每眼井能浇地三十至五十亩，也是很好的办法。
    有些群众在打井时，顾虑有流沙、水质坏或水量少，或顾虑技工的技术不良，不肯轻易尝试。平原省有几个专区，曾经开办打井下泉训练班，成绩很好。该省若干地方人民政府，聘请成绩特优的打井技师，经常到各处巡回工作，推广优良技术，起了很大作用。平原省汤阴县利用打井贷款，由银行、打井户、烧窑户几方面订立合同，烧窑户用款，打井户偿还，办法很好。水车的生产要早计划，早准备，不但要作全年计划，而且要作逐月的采购和生产计划。去年河北省若干私营水车工厂，因无工作被迫停工，就是计划不周的结果。
    二、如何发展渠道灌溉？
    旧的被封建势力所把持的渠道管理机构，在华北基本上已被摧毁。有些地区已经成立了以河系为单位的统一机构。要想把渠道管理好，第一要发扬民主，第二要健全机构。各地的组织形式虽不同，但已向着民主的方向发展。在渠道管理机构中，应有足够的干部，负责征收水费和保养修建等工作，并掌握水量的分配。增加工作干部，当然增加了开支，但与扩大灌溉面积的收益比较起来，这种开支是很小的。旧灌溉区的群众，已养成浪费用水的习惯，一旦加以限制，很容易引起反感，需要进行长期的节省用水的爱国主义教育，并使他们认识到多浇水不但不能增产，反会减少产量，损坏土地质量。
    为达到控制和有计划地分配水量的目的，必须：一、设立能够操纵水量的建筑物；二、掌握确实的灌溉面积；三、掌握作物的需水时间和需水量。建筑物必须是永久性的，在支渠口修建分水闸，在斗渠口修建斗门，必要时配置铁锁。平原省广济渠的灌溉面积，一九四九年只九万五千亩，经改善后，一九五○年已增至二十四万亩。可见旧渠道的工程及管理的改进工作是很重要的。农作物的需水时间和需水量因地而异，经过试验才能得出比较可靠的结论来。河北、平原两省每秒立方公尺的水平均只浇地约一万亩，这无疑有很大的浪费，如果加以合理的控制，在棉麦地区，扩大到三万亩是不成问题的。
    中小型渠道修建较易，目前应尽可能的发展这种渠道。动员山区群众作小型塘坝，挖蓄水池，一方面可以截洪拦沙，另一方面还可以蓄水浇地。华北的水源不足，河流中涓滴之水全是珍贵的，所以应多作蓄水库。各大河系的工程规划，现在即应开始。
    在华北区除发展水利预防旱灾外，还必须依靠各种防旱抗旱的耕作方法，及时发动群众耕、锄、耙、耢以保持土中的水分。河北省杨秀峰主席、平原省罗玉川副主席，今春曾率领大批干部下乡，动员群众抗旱植棉，不但完成而且超过了原计划的植棉面积，成绩很大。养成广大群众防旱抗旱的耕作习惯，是很重要的。
