　　The Phenomenon of Some Enterprises in North China Purchasing Goods at High Prices in Shanghai Should Be Corrected

To the Editor: At present, some units in North China still purchase goods in Shanghai at will, which affects the state-owned trading organs' grasp of local market prices and causes losses to state property. In September, the Beijing Public Yanjing Paper Mill entrusted the Shanghai private merchant "Mingxing Paper Edge Shop" to purchase 1,000 dan of waste paper, and the shop purchased it at will at a high price. The market price of white paper was originally 213,000 yuan per dan, but they raised the purchase price to 231,000 yuan; the market price of Daolin paper was 300,000 yuan, but they raised the purchase price to 330,000 yuan, an average increase of about 10% compared with the market price, creating opportunities for paper merchants to seek exorbitant profits. Another example is the public-owned Shanxi Provincial Textile Company Jinsheng Yarn Factory, which did not contact the East China Industrial Department and related departments, and successively ordered machines from the Shanghai private merchant Da Zhonghua Iron Factory, with a transaction volume of more than 4 billion yuan. The price of only eight machines was more than 280 million yuan higher than the transaction price of the East China Textile Administration Bureau. In addition, the state-owned Tianjin Trust Company did not conscientiously implement the unified procurement regulations, and in October of this year, it directly ordered machines from private merchants in Shanghai on behalf of the Xi'an Industrial Administration Bureau of Liaodong Province, the Civil Affairs Department of the Central South District, and other agencies.

　　These situations not only affect the state-owned trading organs' grasp of market prices, but also create the idea among private merchants that there are huge profits to be made from trading with agencies and units in other places, thus creating a phenomenon that private merchants are unwilling to deal with local state-owned enterprises, causing unnecessary difficulties for state-owned enterprises in carrying out processing and commissioned processing. I believe that this phenomenon should attract the close attention of the financial and economic committees at all levels, especially the leading comrades of each enterprise.

### 应纠正华北区某些企业单位高价在上海采购物资的现象

　　应纠正华北区某些企业单位高价在上海采购物资的现象
    编辑同志：目前华北区仍有个别单位，随意在上海采购物资，影响了国营贸易机关对当地市场价格的掌握，使国家财产受到损失。北京公营燕京造纸厂九月间曾委托上海私商“明兴纸边号”收购废纸一千担，该号即随意以高价收购。白报纸每担市价本为二十一万三千元，他们把收购价提高到二十三万一千元；道林纸市价三十万元，他们把收购价提高到三十三万元，平均较市价抬高了百分之十左右，给纸商造成谋取暴利的机会。又如公营山西省纺织公司晋生纱厂，未与华东工业部以及有关部门取得联系，陆续向上海私商大中华铁工厂订购机器，交易额达四十多亿元。其中仅八项机器的价格，就比华东纺织管理局的成交价高出两亿八千多万元。此外，国营天津市信托公司也不认真执行统一采购的规定，曾于今年十月代辽东省西安市工业管理局、中南区民政部优抚局等机关直接在上海向私商订购机器。
    以上这些情况，不仅影响了国营贸易机关对市场价格的掌握，同时造成了私商觉得与外埠机关单位交易有暴利可图的思想，因而产生私商不愿与当地国营企业部门往来的现象，使国营企业在执行加工和委托加工时遇到不必要的困难。我认为这一现象，应引起各级财政经济委员会、特别是各企业单位领导同志的严密注意。
