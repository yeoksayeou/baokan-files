    Guarantees That Pig Iron Bars Will Meet Specifications in the Future

    Editor: We are very grateful for the criticism made by Zhang Huaiyu of Jinan Railway Factory in the People's Daily on September 27 regarding the non-standard shape of iron bars produced by our factory. Because our factory's production has developed rapidly, the technical proficiency of new workers has not kept pace with the needs of the work, and because the iron tapping area is insufficient, the sand molding process may not be careful enough. However, in any case, there are many shortcomings in our work. To ensure that the shape of pig iron bars meets specifications, we plan to do the following: (1) When making sand molds, we will try to remove broken iron and add more ledges to the branch ditches to reduce the size of the main beams; (2) We will lengthen the iron pulling rods to avoid walking in the sand mold and damaging the sand mold when pulling iron; (3) We will be more careful when removing the pattern from the flat mold to prevent sand from falling from the sand mold; (4) We will frequently replace old wooden molds.

### 石景山钢铁厂  保证今后生铁条形合乎规格

    保证今后生铁条形合乎规格
    编辑同志：人民日报九月二十七日刊载了济南铁路工厂张怀玉对我厂所产生铁条形不合规格的批评，我们十分感谢。由于我厂的生产发展得很快，新工人的技术熟练程度赶不上工作的需要，而且，又因出铁场不敷应用，因此，制砂型时可能发生不够仔细的现象。但不管怎样，我们在工作中是存在着不少缺点的。为了使生铁条形合于规格起见，我们准备作到下列几点：（一）作砂型时尽量将碎铁搂净，并在支沟上多作坎台，使大梁的块度减小；（二）加长拉铁杆，避免拉铁时在砂型中行走而踏毁砂型；（三）平模起模时多加小心，不使砂型掉砂；（四）勤换老旧木模。
