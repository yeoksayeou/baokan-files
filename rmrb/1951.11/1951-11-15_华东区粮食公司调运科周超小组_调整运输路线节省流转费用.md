The Zhou Chao group of the Transportation Section of the East China Grain Company
    Adjusts Transportation Routes to Save Circulation Costs
    The Zhou Chao group of the Transportation Section of the China Grain Company's East China District Company has twice submitted rationalization proposals to higher authorities to reduce the cost of goods in circulation, saving the state over 1.008 billion yuan in transportation costs.
    The Transportation Section is the department of the company that manages the allocation and transportation of grain. In the past, the Zhou Chao group, like other groups, simply transported grain according to the notices from the planning office and business office, with the specific tasks of calculating the tonnage of vehicles and ships, transportation costs, and so on. After the patriotic education of resisting America and aiding Korea, the comrades of the group decided to play a creative role in their work, ensure the completion of state-owned enterprises' profit delivery, and increase material strength for resisting America and aiding Korea.
    In early October, a certain organization issued a task of transporting a batch of grain from northern Anhui to Tianjin, and the district company also arranged to transport a batch of grain from northern Jiangsu to Shanghai. The types and quantities of grain specified in these two tasks were the same. After accepting the task, the group immediately calculated the freight rates precisely and identified the accurate direction of grain circulation. The original plan of a certain organization was to transport grain from various parts of northern Anhui to Tianjin, with an average railway transportation distance of 906 kilometers and a total transportation cost of 2.46 billion yuan. If the grain was transported to Shanghai instead, the average railway distance would be 517 kilometers, and the total transportation cost would only be 1.69 billion yuan. This would save 760 million yuan in transportation costs. The original district company planned to ship grain from a certain area of northern Jiangsu to Shanghai, with an average transportation distance of 874 kilometers and a total transportation cost of 2.409 billion yuan; if this batch of grain was transported to Tianjin instead, the average transportation distance would be 796 kilometers, and the total transportation cost would only be 2.22 billion yuan. This would save another 180 million yuan in transportation costs. After repeated research and careful calculation, the group submitted rationalization proposals to higher authorities, changing the original transportation plan to transport grain from a certain area of northern Jiangsu to Tianjin and to transport grain from a certain area of northern Anhui to Shanghai. The higher authorities agreed to the group's plan. As a result, unreasonable opposite transportation was avoided, and 950 million yuan of state assets were saved.

　　华东区粮食公司调运科周超小组
    调整运输路线节省流转费用
    中国粮食公司华东区公司调运科周超小组，两度向上级提出合理化建议，减低商品在流转过程中的费用，为国家节省运费十亿零八千余万元。
    调运科是该公司管理粮食调拨运输的部门。过去，周超小组也像其他小组一样，每天只是根据计划室、业务室的通知，调运粮食，具体工作是计算车船吨位、运输费用，等等。经过抗美援朝爱国主义教育，该小组同志们决定在工作中发挥创造性，保证完成国营企业上缴利润，增加抗美援朝物质力量。
    十月初，某机关下达了由皖北调运一批粮食至天津的任务，区公司也布置了从苏北南调一批粮食至上海的任务。这两个任务规定的粮种和数量是相同的。该组接受任务后，立即精密计算运价，并且找出准确的粮食流转方向。某机关原计划由皖北各地运到天津的粮食，铁路平均运输里程为九○六公里，全部运费为二十四亿六千余万元。如果改运上海，则铁路平均里程为五一七公里，全部运费只需十六亿九千余万元。这样即可节省运费七亿六千余万元。原区公司计划由苏北某地发运上海的粮食，平均运输里程八七四公里，全部运费二十四亿零九百余万元；如果把这批粮食改运天津，运输平均里程为七九六公里，全部运费只需二十二亿二千余万元。这样，又节省运费一亿八千余万元。经过反复研究和周密计算后，该组便向上级提出了合理化建议，改变原有运输计划，将苏北某地区粮食调运天津，皖北某地区的粮食改运上海。上级同意了该组的计划。结果，避免了不合理的相向运输，节省了国家资财九亿五千余万元。（本报综合）
