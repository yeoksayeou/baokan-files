    Tianjin Electric Power Bureau Third Power Plant Maintenance Group
    Responding to Chairman Mao's Call, Discusses Ways to Increase Production and Practice Economy
    Comrade Editor: Chairman Mao instructed us at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "In order to continue to uphold this necessary and just struggle, we need to continue to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and we need to increase production and practice strict economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers. This is the central task of the Chinese people today.” Our group is determined to respond to Chairman Mao's call with practical actions. With the united efforts of the group, we have completed the production increase and donation tasks for August, September, and October. Moreover, a certain boiler that had been unusable for more than a decade has been thoroughly overhauled and is now operating normally and safely. When we discussed Chairman Mao's call, everyone expressed their determination to make even better achievements according to his instructions. Wu Enjun said: “Most of Tianjin’s factories rely on us for electricity. If we cannot generate electricity safely, who knows how much production will be delayed.” Lü Changyu said: "I will definitely guarantee the completion of the task of installing the drainpipe as stipulated in the November patriotic pact." Zhang Guoqing said: "In addition to making every effort to use old materials and not waste a single piece of material, I also guarantee good quality."

    天津电业局第三发电厂维护小组
    响应毛主席号召，讨论增产节约办法
    编辑同志：毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议上指示我们：“为了继续坚持这个必要的正义的斗争，我们就需要继续加强抗美援朝的工作，需要增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军。这是中国人民今天的中心任务。”我们小组一定以实际行动来响应毛主席的号召。在小组团结一致共同努力下，我们已完成了八、九、十三个月的增产捐献任务。并且，十几年不能用的某号锅炉，经过彻底检修后，已能正常地安全运转了。我们在讨论毛主席的号召时，大家都表示一定按着指示做出更好的成绩。吴恩俊说：“天津市的工厂大多是靠我们这里送电的。如果我们不能安全发电，不知要耽误多少的生产。”吕长裕说：“我一定保证完成十一月份所订爱国公约里的装好放水管的工作。”张国清说：“我除了尽量利用旧料不浪费一块材料外，而且保证质量好。”
