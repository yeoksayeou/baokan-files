Letter Summary:

    The Work of Elementary School Teachers Should Not Be Underestimated
    The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government convened the First National Conference on Primary Education and Normal Education in August and September, which established the policy of universalizing children's education and vigorously training teachers.
    However, at present, many elementary school teachers and normal school students in training do not have sufficient understanding of this point, and are not settled in their work and study positions. In the Huizhou Normal School in Southern Anhui Province, many students believed that "there is no future for normal school students" and "there is no future for elementary school teachers" during this year's summer enrollment. Among the female graduates of She County Junior High School this term, many were admitted to Tunxi Girls' High School, and not a single one applied to normal school. In light of this situation, the cultural and educational organs and the organizations of the Communist Youth League in various places must strengthen the study of elementary school teachers and normal school students.

    不应轻视小学教师的工作
    中央人民政府教育部在八、九月间召开了第一次全国初等教育及师范教育会议，确定了普及儿童教育和大力培养师资的方针。
    但目前，有不少的小学教师和正在学习的师范学生对这一点认识不足，不安心于自己的工作与学习岗位。皖南区徽州师范在今年暑期的招生中，许多学生认为“师范生无出路”“小学教师无前途”。歙县初中本期毕业的女同学，多考入了屯溪女中，投考师范的一个人也没有。根据这一情况，各地文教机关与青年团的组织必须加强小学教师和师范学生的学习。　一平
