    Expose and Correct the Tendency of Ignoring Politics in School Education

    Editor:

    I recently saw a report in the "South Sichuan Daily" (October 10th) stating that some schools in the South Sichuan region, due to a misunderstanding of the spirit of overcoming chaotic phenomena, have developed a serious tendency of ignoring politics. Some teachers and students distorted the overcoming of chaotic phenomena to mean "not asking about politics" and misinterpreted the carrying out of regular coursework as "studying behind closed doors." Some students, apart from attending classes and doing exercises, are indifferent to everything else. Some teachers also mistakenly believe that "burying oneself in books and not asking about external affairs" is a correct attitude towards learning and encourage students in this way. For example, some schools in Yibin, South Sichuan, showed no interest in the National Day celebration that was enjoyed by the whole country. Some students at the Jianle Higher Industrial School in South Sichuan not only do not value learning Chinese, but even put forward wrong slogans such as "If you learn mathematics, physics, and chemistry, you are not afraid of anything." The mathematics and physics teacher of the fifth term of Zizhong Middle School in South Sichuan forced students to rush through the curriculum by using a large number of exercises.

    I believe that this tendency of ignoring politics that has occurred in some schools in the South Sichuan region should be quickly corrected.

    In order to do a good job in the New Democratic education, I hope that everyone will pay attention to this issue, expose and correct the tendency of ignoring politics in school education.

    揭露并纠正学校教育中不问政治的倾向编辑同志：
    最近看到“川南日报”（十月十日）报道：川南区部分学校由于误解了克服混乱现象的精神，因而发生严重的不问政治的倾向。部分教师和学生把克服混乱现象歪曲为“不问政治”，把开展正课学习误解为“关门读书”。有些学生除了上课，做习题外，什么都不闻不问。有些教师也错误地认为“埋头读书，不问外事”是一种正确的学习态度，并以此对学生进行鼓励。例如，川南宜宾有些学校学生对于举国狂欢的国庆节，也都不理不睬。川南犍乐高等工业学校部分学生不但不重视语文学习，并竟提出“学了数、理、化，什么都不怕”等错误的口号。川南资中中学高中五期数理教师，用大量的习题，逼使学生赶课。
    我认为川南区部分学校发生的这种不问政治的倾向，是应该迅速纠正的。
    为了作好新民主主义的教育工作，我希望大家重视这个问题，揭露并纠正学校教育中不问政治的倾向。    青禾
