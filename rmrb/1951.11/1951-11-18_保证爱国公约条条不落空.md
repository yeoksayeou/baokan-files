Be sure to fulfill every item in the patriotic pact
Wang Shuting, leader of the special model mutual aid group for implementing the patriotic pact in Yuanyang County, Pingyuan Province

Our mutual aid group has three households and sixty mu of land. From last spring to May of this year, in nearly a year and a half, the entire group, in addition to covering food expenses, replaced the old donkey with a good ox, bought three small pieces of furniture, and also paid off a debt of two shi and five dou of grain. After we established the patriotic pact in May of this year, everyone's enthusiasm for labor was even higher. Now the conditions of "increase production, donate, and expand production" stipulated in our patriotic pact have been realized. The donation plan has been completed ahead of schedule, and we have newly purchased one large and one small ox each, bought five large pieces of furniture, and paid off another four shi and two dou of debt.

The government called for "love the country, plant more wheat," so our group added a clause to the patriotic pact, stipulating that except for reserving six mu of cotton fields, the rest would be planted with wheat. When formulating the pact, we first asked everyone to discuss it, explaining why this clause was necessary. During the discussion, Jia Fangquan said: "We always want to eat white flour, and the volunteers fighting the war certainly also prefer eating white flour. If we don't plant more wheat, how can we supply the volunteers with white flour? Furthermore, we must guarantee the supply of wheat grain needed by our cities." Everyone then understood why we needed to plant more wheat, and they became proactive in their work. All fifty-four mu of wheat land in the group were not only planted quickly and in season, but also all seeds were soaked before planting, and the seeds for the twenty-one mu of insect-infested land were all treated. Group member Wang Shuxiang said: "As long as we have a good harvest next year, we will definitely pay the agricultural tax in full at once, all in wheat." This is the new atmosphere in our mutual aid group after the establishment of the patriotic pact.

After establishing the pact, inspection is also a major matter. It is not easy to implement well without inspection. When planting wheat, our group originally stipulated that the seeds should be treated, but because we were not used to it, we forgot to buy the medicine before planting. When inspecting the patriotic pact, we discovered this situation and immediately sent someone to the city to buy the medicine, meeting the requirements of the patriotic pact.

Our group has achieved results in implementing the patriotic pact. Now everyone is saying: "We must regularly inspect and revise the patriotic pact to ensure that every item is fulfilled." (Written by Shijie)

    保证爱国公约条条不落空
    平原省原阳县执行爱国公约特等模范互助组组长王书廷
    我们互助组共有三户，六十亩地。从去年春天到今年五月将近一年半的时间内，全组除去吃项，把老驴换成了一头好牛，买了三样小家具以外，还还清了两石五斗粮食的账。今年五月订立了爱国公约后，大家的劳动情绪更高。现在我们爱国公约上订的“增产捐献、扩大生产”的条件，已经实现了。捐献计划已经提前完成，并新买大、小牛各一头，买大家具五件，又还账四石二斗。
    政府号召“要爱国，多种麦”，我们组就在爱国公约里添了一条，除留六亩棉田外，其余全种麦子。在订公约时，先叫大家商量，说明为啥要订这一条。在讨论中，贾方全就说：“咱麦罢了想吃白的，志愿军打仗当然也是吃白的好，咱不多种麦，咋能供志愿军吃白面呢？再说：咱们城市需要的麦粮，咱都得保证供给上。”大家就明白了为啥要多种麦，工作起来就积极。全组五十四亩麦地，不但种的快、应时，并且全部浸种，二十一亩生虫地还全是拌的种。组员王书祥说：“明年只要收的多，公粮一定一次交清，全交麦子。”这就是我们互助组订立爱国公约以后的新气象。
    订立公约以后，检查也是大事。不检查就不容易执行好。种麦时，我们组原订的要拌种，可是因为不习惯，临种前，忘了买药，在检查爱国公约时，发觉了这个情况，马上就叫人到城里去买了药，达到了爱国公约上的要求。
    我们组里执行爱国公约有了成绩，现在人人都说：“咱要经常检查修订爱国公约，保证条条不落空。”（士杰代笔）
