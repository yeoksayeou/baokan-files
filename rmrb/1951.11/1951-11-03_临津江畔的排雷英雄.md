    The Mine-Clearing Hero on the Banks of the Imjin River
    Xing Shicao
    On the eve of the first anniversary of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, I met a mine-clearing hero on the Korean battlefield who had been considered gloriously sacrificed and mourned by his comrades. He is a Communist Party member named Zhang Caishu. In the battle to cross the Imjin River last winter, his selfless and heroic actions set a shining example for his comrades.
    The night before the battle began, Zhang Caishu gave his letter of determination to the political instructor of the company. The letter of determination read: "In order to break through the Imjin River, I guarantee to complete the mine-clearing mission. If the hook breaks, I will pull it with my hands; if my hands break, I will kick it with my feet; if my feet break, I will roll over with my body, resolutely complete the mission, and let the assault platoon pass smoothly."
    On the day the battle was launched, he led a squad crouching in the anti-artillery cave in the communication trench. The excitement of killing the enemy made him often stick his head out to see the direction of the sun. He often thought of his letter of determination, remembering the words on it. He also took out a white handkerchief, stained with blood. This red handkerchief often ignited the flames of his hatred for the American aggressors.
    In early November, he went to a village outside to stand guard and saw three Koreans dead on the road: a man, a woman, and a little girl less than two years old. There were many bullet holes on the ground, and many heavy machine gun shells nearby. This was obviously another crime committed by the American aerial bandits. Zhang Caishu picked up a bright red handkerchief from the side of the deceased and put it in his pocket. Although this was only one of the countless disasters of the Korean people, it made it difficult for him to forget for a long time.
    The Imjin River gradually dimmed, and the soldiers became nervous. When three red signal flares rose into the sky, our artillery opened fire on the enemy. Red light flashed on the enemy's positions, explosions rang out, and black smoke billowed into the sky. The enemy knew that our attack had begun, and their artillery and machine guns also opened fire.
    At this time, Zhang Caishu dragged a mine-clearing pole more than ten feet long, jumped out of the communication trench, and beckoned to the people behind him, rushing towards the sloping river beach. There was a depression in front. This terrain, which was easy to hide, was also a good place for the enemy to bury mines. He cleverly lay down and waved back, and Zhao Zhenhai and Jin Yushan also lay down on the spot.
    Zhang Caishu extended the mine-clearing hook at the front of the mine-clearing pole, hooked it once, and it didn't go off. He then extended the hook to the right front of the depression, and with a gentle pull, the mine exploded. He quickly jumped into the depression and continued to crawl forward. Mines were detonated one by one by his mine-clearing hook. Pillars of fire shot into the sky, shrapnel mixed with rocks flew up and fell down, the smell of gunpowder stimulated the throat, and black smoke shrouded the river surface. His left hand was injured, but he still crawled forward; the hook was blown up, he changed another hook and crawled forward again.
    The Imjin River was a red glow, the machine gun bullets fired by both sides were like strings of meteors, and the explosions of artillery and mines kept shaking. The enemy obviously knew that our army was clearing this dense minefield, and several machine guns swept towards the place where the mines exploded. Under this tight fire net, on this mine-filled river beach, the hero Zhang Caishu calmly crawled and cleared the minefield laid by the U.S. military.
    When he was not far from the frozen river surface, he looked back and saw that, in the light of the flare, two comrades were pulling ladders to keep up, and deputy platoon leader Fan Huijing was also rushing up with a box for marking the road. Behind him, the assault team had begun to move.
    He thought of his letter of determination, thought of not letting his comrades be wounded or killed here, and thought of enabling the assault team's mission to be successfully completed. He secretly made up his mind: "I must complete the task before they come up!"
    At this time, only half of the mine-clearing pole in his hand was left, and it was useless. He threw it away, pressed his hands on the ground, and lunged forward, grabbing a copper wire with his right hand, and with a pull back, there was another series of mine explosions.
    He was stunned by the shock. But he woke up in an instant. He groped forward with his hands and searched left and right with his feet. He resolutely continued to crawl forward, and when he got close to the water's edge, he found that the mines were denser and the enemy's machine guns were firing even tighter. His hands and arms were bleeding. But he crawled to the water's edge regardless of his own safety, and pulled the last copper wire, and five or six mines exploded at the same time.
    The minefield that the enemy attempted to use to block our army's advance was completely crushed. At this time, the hero Zhang Caishu was covered in blood and dirt from shrapnel and stones, and lay there motionless.
    Under the illumination of gasoline bombs, flares, and electric light bombs, our assault team passed through this charging road stained with the hero's blood, shouting the slogan "Avenge Comrade Zhang Caishu!" and successfully crossed the Imjin River.
    The comrades all thought that he had gloriously sacrificed while clearing the last group of mines. But this brave man, who had crossed over a hundred exploding mines, returned to the front line in high spirits after being treated in the rear. On the front line, the good news spread everywhere. The leading organs awarded him the title of "Mine-Clearing Hero." Zhang Caishu was received with unparalleled respect and enthusiastic cheers from his comrades wherever he went.

### 临津江畔的排雷英雄

    临津江畔的排雷英雄
    邢石操
    抗美援朝一周年纪念日前夕，我在朝鲜战场上见到一个被他的战友们认为已经光荣牺牲而追悼过的排雷英雄。他是一位共产党员，名叫张才树。在去年冬天强渡临津江的战斗中，他的奋不顾身的英雄行为给战友们树立起光辉的榜样。
    战斗开始的前一天晚上，张才树把决心书交给连的政治指导员。决心书上这样写着：“为突破临津江，我保证完成排雷任务。钩子断了，我用手拉；手断了，我用脚踢；脚断了，我用身子滚，坚决完成任务，让突击排顺利通过。”
    战斗发起的白天，他带着一个班蹲在交通沟的防炮洞里。激动的杀敌情绪使他时常探出头来，看看太阳的方位。他不时想到自己的决心书，记着上面的字句。他又掏出一块白手巾，手巾上血迹斑斑，这块红色的手巾经常燃起他对美国侵略者仇恨的火焰。
    十一月初，他到一个村庄外去放哨，看见公路上死了三个朝鲜人：一男一女，还有一个不到二周岁的小女孩。地上有很多子弹洞，附近有很多重机枪弹壳。这显然又是美国空中强盗犯的罪。张才树拾起死者身边一条殷红的手巾，揣在身上。虽然这只是朝鲜人民千万灾难之一，却使他久久难以遗忘。
    临津江上逐渐昏暗了，战士们也跟着紧张起来。当三颗红色信号弹升上天空的时候，我们的大炮向敌人开火了。红光在敌人阵地上闪耀，爆炸声响成一片，黑烟滚滚冲上天空。敌人知道我们的攻击已经开始，他们的炮和机枪也开火了。
    这时，张才树拖着一丈多长的排雷杆，跳出了交通壕，招呼着后面的人，向倾斜的江滩上奔去。前面有一块凹地。这个便于隐蔽的地形也正是敌人埋地雷的好场所。他机智地卧倒了，并向后一招手，赵振海、金玉山也就地卧倒。
    张才树伸出排雷杆前端的排雷钩，钩了一下没响。他又把钩子伸到凹地的右前方，轻轻一拉，地雷就爆炸了。他迅速地跳进凹地，继续向前爬行。地雷一个个地被他的排雷钩钩响。火柱子窜向上空，弹片夹着石头，飞上去，落下来，火药味刺激着喉咙，黑烟笼罩着江面。他左手负伤了，仍然向前爬进；钩子被炸坏了，换一个钩子再向前爬。
    临津江上一片通红，双方射击的机枪子弹，像一串串流星，大炮和地雷的爆炸声不停地震响着。敌人显然已知道我军正在排除这密密层层的地雷阵，好几挺机枪向地雷爆炸的地方扫射。在这紧密的火网下，在这满布地雷的江滩上，英雄张才树沉着地一面爬一面排除美军布置的地雷阵。
    到离冻结的江面不远时，他回头一看，在照明弹的光亮下，有两个同志拉着梯子跟上来了，副排长范会经提着打路标的盒子也赶上来了。后边，突击队已开始运动。
    他想起了自己的决心书，想到不能让战友们在这里遭到伤亡，想到要使突击队的任务能够胜利完成。自己暗暗下了决心：“我一定要在他们上来之前完成任务！”
    这时，他手里的排雷杆只剩下半截杆子，不中用了。他丢掉了它，双手往地面一按，向前窜了一大步，右手抓起一根铜丝，向后一拉，又是一连串的地雷爆炸声。
    他被震昏了。但一霎间就醒过来了。他用手向前面探摸，用脚向左右搜索。他坚毅地继续向前爬行，到靠近水边时，发现地雷更加稠密，敌人的机枪也打得更紧了。他的手上、臂上在流着血。但是他奋不顾身地爬到了水边，扯着最后一根铜丝，五六颗地雷同时响起来。
    敌人妄图阻拦我军前进的地雷阵全部被粉碎了。这时，英雄张才树已被弹片和石头打得浑身血污，躺在那里不动了。
    在汽油弹、照明弹、电光弹的照耀下，我们的突击队通过这条沾着英雄的鲜血的冲锋道路，高喊着为“张才树同志复仇！”的口号，胜利地冲过了临津江。
    战友们都以为他已在排除最后的一群地雷时光荣牺牲了。但是这位越过了一百颗爆炸的地雷的勇敢的人，经过在后方治疗后，又英姿勃勃地回到前线来了。在前线上，这个喜讯到处传扬开来。领导机关授予他“排雷英雄”的称号。张才树每到一地，都受到战友们无比的崇敬和热情的欢呼。
