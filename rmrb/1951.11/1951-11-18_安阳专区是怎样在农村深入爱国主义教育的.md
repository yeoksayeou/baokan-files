    In September and October of this year, the Anyang Special District of Pingyuan Province mobilized nearly 20,000 cadres at all levels, Party propagandists, and activists among the masses to conduct another widespread and in-depth patriotic education campaign among the farmers of the entire special district.

    This education was mainly carried out in conjunction with various tasks. One of the most effective methods was to mobilize the masses to summarize the production achievements of the past two years, so that farmers could realize that individual prosperity cannot be separated from the leadership of the state power, and that individual production is consistent with national construction. For example, the Communist Party branch of Baozhuang Village in Qi County first reported to the masses on the changes in the village over the past two years: in 1948, the village had only one cow, but now it has 170; it didn't have a single sheep in the past, now it has 178. The whole village had been robbed by the enemy, leaving only two quilts; now each household has an average of three new quilts. All aspects of the people's lives have improved, and three civil schools have been established in the village, with more than 60 young people participating in the study. After pointing out these facts, the masses felt that life was changing rapidly and production was developing rapidly. Then, groups and households launched discussions and summaries. For example, farmer Jia Jian said: "My family of eight used to have only two acres of land, and we suffered from lack of food and clothing, and were exploited by the landlords; I was liberated in the land reform, and the government provided loans to help me buy a mule. Now I cultivate more than ten acres of land, raise three cows, one mule, and bought ten sheep, and built three new houses. If it weren't for the leadership of the Communist Party and the government, how could we have such a good time? To protect this good time, I persuaded my son to join the army and go to the front line to fight the American devils, and I will work hard at home to increase production and donate planes. This year I donated 120 kilograms of grain." The thirteen mutual aid groups in the village found in their summary that this year's fine grain production increased by 96 shi. For example, Jia Luanniu's family participated in the mutual aid group this year, and applied 15 more dan of fertilizer per mu than last year, and the yield of millet and corn per mu was five dou more than last year. The family added one cow and eight sheep. He said:
    "Cooperation and mutual assistance have made us rich, and we have married independently. Without the support and leadership of the state power, where would we be today?"

    On the basis of summarizing production, the Anyang Special District conducted education on the future of the revolution for farmers, put forward new goals for production, mobilized farmers to formulate production plans, and encouraged everyone to move forward under the leadership of the government. Due to the improvement of farmers' lives, some people developed the idea of ​​being satisfied with "thirty mu of land and a cow." Therefore, all localities generally educated farmers about building a new democratic society and preparing for a better socialist future, and some also organized farmers to visit factories, hold exhibitions, or invite people who had visited factories in cities to come back and report, so that farmers could understand the advanced role of industrial production and the leading power of the working class. At the same time, the leading organs of the special district, based on the situation in the district, put forward production plans for next year. The whole district is preparing to add 20,000 mu of paddy fields, build eight highways, increase 1,500 waterwheels, 5,000 sprayers, 300 new-style plows, 150 grass-cutting machines, and 50 corn threshers, and plans to earn 16 million catties of corn from sideline production this winter, in addition to doing a good job in winter plowing, as an investment in agricultural production. These measures greatly broadened the horizons of farmers. The general reaction was: I always felt that production and time were about the same, but now I know that the good is still to come, and it is far from enough, we have to work harder. Everyone also felt that such a big step forward "cannot be done without the state." Villages, groups, and households are all making plans, and the enthusiasm for patriotic production has risen.

    While carrying out production education, all localities have strengthened current affairs propaganda. More than 11,000 Party propagandists, more than 2,600 civil schools, hundreds of newspaper reading groups, rural clubs, rural libraries, rural theater troupes, and village blackboard newspapers and rooftop broadcasts in the entire special district have all launched patriotic propaganda activities. The special district and counties also organized propaganda teams and report teams to go to the countryside to promote, and brought films, slides, radios and other propaganda tools to the countryside. Some places also held exhibitions and organized temple fairs for propaganda. In current affairs propaganda, many areas conducted in-depth education on opposing the American arming of Japan, such as denouncing the crimes of the United States, Japan, and special agents at the public trial of counter-revolutionary elements, and holding mass rallies to mourn the compatriots who died in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. Facts have proved that the past propaganda education against the American arming of Japan was not thorough enough. Many cadres believed that the propaganda education against the American arming of Japan had "been publicized, and everyone knows it" or "it's not new, it doesn't work," all of which were wrong ideas. After Qi County's 84 villages carried out in-depth propaganda education against the American arming of Japan, the masses' hatred of American imperialism and their enthusiasm for patriotic killing of the enemy rose sharply, and more than 3,300 people expressed their willingness to go to the Korean front to join the Volunteer Army. Some places also established a regular "enemy situation analysis" system in current affairs propaganda. For example, after the fourth district of Tangyin analyzed the current situation that the lurking counter-revolutionary elements in the district were still using various methods to carry out conspiracies, it greatly strengthened the vigilance of cadres and the masses, and strengthened the unity and vigilance of the masses.

    After a series of patriotic ideological education, Qi County and other places mobilized the masses to check and revise the patriotic conventions, launched a "three-comparison" movement of "comparing ideas, comparing content, and comparing actions," and selected patriotic models. Each village, from the neighborhood to the whole village, from cadres and Party members to the masses, discussed each article of their patriotic convention, compared everyone's patriotic ideas and patriotic actions, and selected models who earnestly implemented the patriotic convention. After such comparisons, the tendency of formalism in the patriotic convention movement was greatly overcome, and various tasks of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea in the countryside were promoted.

    安阳专区是怎样在农村深入爱国主义教育的
    平原省安阳专区在今年九、十两月，发动各级干部、党的宣传员与各阶层群众中的积极分子近两万人，向全专区农民又一次普遍深入地进行了爱国主义的教育。
    这次教育主要是结合各种工作进行的。其中最有效的办法之一，是发动群众总结两年来的生产成绩，使农民认识到个人发家离不开国家政权的领导，个人生产与国家建设的一致性。例如淇县鲍庄村中共支部首先把全村两年来的变化向群众作了报告：一九四八年，全村只有一头牛，现在已有一百七十头；过去没有一只羊，现在有一百七十八只。全村曾被敌人抢得只剩下两条被子；现在每户平均有三条新被子。群众生活的各方面都有改善，村里建立了三处民校，有六十多名青壮年参加了学习。指出这些事实之后，群众都感到生活变化得快，生产发展得快，接着各组、各户都展开了讨论和总结。如农民贾见说：“我家八口人，过去只二亩地，少吃没穿，受尽了地主的剥削；土地改革中我翻了身，政府又贷款帮助我买了骡子，现在我种十几亩地，养了三头牛，一头骡子，买了十只羊，盖了三间新楼房，还开了一个砖窑。要不是共产党和政府的领导，怎能有这样好时光。要保住这好时光，我劝儿子参军上前线打美国鬼子，我在家努力增产捐飞机。今年我捐一百二十斤粮食。”全村十三个互助组，在总结中发现，今年增产了细粮九十六石。如贾乱妞家今年因为参加了互助组，每亩地比去年多上了十五担粪，谷子和玉茭每亩都比去年多收了五斗。家里添了一头牛、八只羊。他说：
    “合作互助发了家，婚姻自主结了婚，没有国家政权对我的支持与领导，那有今天的好光景。”
    在总结生产的基础上，安阳专区又向农民进行了革命前途的教育，并提出生产上新的奋斗目标，发动农民订出生产计划，鼓舞大家在政府领导下前进。由于农民生活的改善，一部分人产生了满足于“三十亩地一头牛”的思想。因此，各地一面普遍向农民进行关于建设新民主主义社会，准备将来进入社会主义美好前途的教育，有的并组织农民参观工厂、举行展览会，或请赴城市参观了工厂的人回来作报告，使农民认识工业生产的先进作用和工人阶级的领导力量。同时，专区领导机关又根据本区情况，提出了明年的生产计划。全区准备增辟两万亩水地，修八条公路，增加一千五百辆水车、五千架喷雾器、三百张新式犁、一百五十部铡草机和五十架玉米脱粒机，并计划今冬除搞好冬耕外，从副业生产中赚一千六百万斤玉米，作为农业生产的投资。这些措施，大大地打开了农民的眼界。普遍反应：以前总觉得生产和时光差不多了，现在才知道好的还在后头，还差得远哩，得加劲干。大家也感到这样大踏步地前进，“离了国家真不行”。各村、各组、各户都纷纷订计划，爱国生产的劲头都起来啦。
    与进行生产教育同时，各地都加强了时事宣传工作。全专区一万一千多名党的宣传员、二千六百多处民校、数百个读报组、农村俱乐部、农村图书馆、农村剧团以及各村的黑板报、屋顶广播等，都开展了爱国主义的宣传活动。专区和各县并组织宣传团、报告团等下乡宣传，并携带电影、幻灯、收音机等宣传工具下乡。有的地方还举行展览会，组织庙会宣传等。在时事宣传中，许多地区深入进行了关于反对美国武装日本的教育，如在公审反革命分子的大会上控诉美、日、特务的罪行，在追悼抗日战争与解放战争中死难同胞的群众大会上举行控诉等。事实证明：过去进行反对美国武装日本的宣传教育还是不深入的。许多干部认为反对美国武装日本已“宣传过了，都知道了”或者“不新鲜了，不起作用了”的想法，都是错误的。淇县八十四个村在这次深入进行了反对美国武装日本的宣传教育之后，群众仇恨美帝国主义，爱国杀敌的情绪极度高涨，有三千三百多人表示要到朝鲜前线去参加志愿军。有的地方在时事宣传中并建立了经常“分析敌情”的制度，如汤阴四区在分析了当前本区潜伏的反革命分子还在用多种方法进行阴谋活动的情况以后，大大加强了干部与群众的警惕性，加强了群众的团结和警惕。
    经过一系列的爱国主义思想教育之后，淇县等地又发动群众检查修订爱国公约，开展“比思想、比内容、比行动”的三比运动，并评选爱国模范。各村从闾到全村，从干部、党员到群众，都按着自己爱国公约逐条讨论，评比各人的爱国思想与爱国行动，并选出认真执行爱国公约的模范。经过这样的评比，大大克服了爱国公约运动中的形式主义偏向，推动了农村中抗美援朝的各种工作。（摘自中共安阳地方委员会研究室来稿）
