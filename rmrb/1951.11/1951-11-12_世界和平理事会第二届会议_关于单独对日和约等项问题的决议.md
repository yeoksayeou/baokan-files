Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, November 10th: The following are five resolutions (with resolutions on cultural relations, using the 1952 holiday for peace work, and the great cultural anniversary to be published tomorrow) of the Second Session of the World Peace Council on the separate peace treaty with Japan, the Korean issue, Vietnam and Southeast Asia, the Near East and Middle East, and the German issue:

Resolution on the Separate Peace Treaty with Japan

The separate peace treaty signed in San Francisco on September 8, 1951, undermines international agreements and violates the interests of peace.

This treaty, signed against the will of the people of China, the Soviet Union, India, and Burma, does not contribute to the establishment of peace in Asia.

Moreover, the immediate consequence of this treaty is the restoration of Japanese militarism and the stationing of foreign troops in Japan, according to the provisions of the US-Japan Security Treaty. This seriously increases the war crisis in the Pacific.

This separate peace treaty strikes at the Japanese people's will for peace and undermines their sovereignty, forcing them to accept the heavy burden of rearmament. The inevitable consequence of this treaty will be the revival of Japanese militarism and the destruction of the Japanese people's economic life.

The World Peace Council reaffirms that to make the peace treaty with Japan truly effective, negotiations must first be conducted by the People's Republic of China, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, and then the consent of all relevant countries must be obtained. Only such a treaty can avoid the war crisis in the Pacific, promote the withdrawal of foreign troops, stop Japan's re-militarization, and contribute to the peaceful development of the Japanese people.

Conversely, the military pacts forced upon the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand are an unbearable burden on the people of these countries and threaten world peace.

The World Peace Council congratulates the Japanese people on their struggle for peace and urges them to work together with the people of neighboring countries to restore peace in the Far East.

The World Peace Council urges all those who support peace in Asia and the Pacific region—including the Japanese people—to hold a regional conference for the defense of peace at the earliest appropriate date. The purpose of this conference is to peacefully resolve the Japanese issue, thereby eliminating a serious threat to world peace.

Resolution on the Korean Issue

The people of the world welcomed the start of the Korean armistice negotiations with great hope. The Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council, meeting in Helsinki, warned that public opinion must be vigilant if the spirit of resolving issues through negotiation is to prevail. Four months have passed, but the negotiations have yielded no results, and the situation over these four months has proved that warning to be correct.

The negotiations have been delayed under the influence of those who want to expand the conflict, and to this day, fierce fighting and bloody destruction continue.

Only sincerity in the negotiations and the support of public opinion can produce an agreement that ends hostilities and makes a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue possible, a peaceful resolution that will restore to the Korean people the right to decide their own destiny.

The World Peace Council demands that all parties engaged in hostilities resolve the Korean conflict as quickly as possible through peaceful negotiations conducted on a fair and reasonable basis. The World Peace Council calls on the people of the world to support this demand.

Resolution on Vietnam and Southeast Asia

The World Peace Council, based on the principles of the United Nations Charter, has always maintained that all nations have the right to resolve their own affairs and to resolve their conflicts without external interference. The World Peace Council declares that only by implementing these principles can a solution be found for the potential and actual conflicts in Southeast Asia.

The World Peace Council believes that among the conflicts developing in Southeast Asia, the development of the Vietnam War (including the wars in Laos and Cambodia) is increasing the danger of a new world war.

The World Peace Council calls for an immediate ceasefire in Vietnam and demands that negotiations begin to seek a comprehensive resolution of the conflict, which should stipulate the withdrawal of foreign troops.

All potential and actual conflicts in Burma, the Philippines, Malaya, and other places should be resolved in accordance with the above principles and with the same measures.

Resolution on the Near East and Middle East

The threat to peace in the Near and Middle East and North Africa has been severely aggravated, as the countries concerned in this region are subjected to increasingly severe military and political control. However, this practice is being resisted by the people from Iran to Morocco. This practice violates their will, because they are determined to achieve economic and national independence and to defend peace.

The World Peace Council condemns the practice of forcibly imposing military pacts on the people of the Mediterranean region—the people of the Near and Middle East and North Africa—considering it a serious threat to world peace.

Foreign troops are now flowing into Egypt, and Egyptians are being killed on their own territory. The Egyptian people's efforts to rid themselves of the burden of treaties that are incompatible with their right to dominate their own country are legitimate and just.

The people of the Near and Middle East and North Africa oppose the stationing of foreign troops on their territory, oppose allowing foreign countries to establish strategic bases, and oppose the seizure of their national wealth. The actions of the Iranian people are the first decisive example of this resistance. This increasingly strong opposition is an extremely important contribution to the cause of peace.

The Egyptian people refuse to participate in a pact that signifies adventure and war. Their actions have strengthened the confidence of the people of all countries in themselves and made a very valuable contribution to the cause of maintaining peace in the Mediterranean region and peace throughout the world.

The World Peace Council demands that all foreign troops immediately withdraw from Egypt and Sudan, so that the latter can freely decide their own destiny.

Resolution on the German Issue

The Washington and Ottawa agreements, which decided to re-militarize West Germany without consulting the German people, have presented the people of all countries with a fait accompli and a very dangerous situation.

The revival of Nazism in West Germany, primarily the task assigned to those former Hitler generals who are leading the new "Bundeswehr," is a serious threat to the entire world, especially to the people of Germany and its neighboring countries.

This process of re-militarization, the refusal to rebuild a unified, peace-loving Germany, the obstruction of the German people from making decisions on the unification of their own country, and the prolongation and strengthening of the occupation by foreign troops—these have created a situation of international discord.

We call on the people of all countries to be vigilant and take action to ensure that the four major powers hold a meeting to conclude a treaty with a demilitarized, unified, peace-loving Germany that can guarantee peace in Europe.

We note with satisfaction the growing wave of public protest in Germany, and we welcome the activities of various groups and individuals against arming Germany and striving for German unification.

This struggle of the German people is an indispensable contribution to building peace, and this struggle must be combined with the same efforts of the people of all countries who have been dragged into the arms expansion plan. The people of these countries will act in coordination with the German people to show their solidarity and thereby ensure the realization of a peaceful solution.

The World Peace Council will encourage and support all such suggestions as the following:

Meetings and consultations between representative figures from Germany and neighboring countries.

Mutual dispatch of representative figures for cultural and economic visits.

Participation of German representatives in mass activities that contribute to the cause of peace.

Given the seriousness of the threat posed by arming Germany to the people of all countries, the World Peace Council urges the peace committees of the countries concerned to closely link the peaceful resolution of the German issue with all other peace-defense activities of the committees.

　　世界和平理事会第二届会议
    关于单独对日和约等项问题的决议 【本报讯】新华社据塔斯社维也纳十日讯：世界和平理事会第二届会议关于单独对日和约、朝鲜问题、越南和东南亚、近东和中东、德国问题等五项决议（尚有关于文化关系、利用一九五二年假期从事和平事业和伟大的文化周年纪念的决议，本报明日继续刊登）如下：
    关于单独对日和约的决议
    一九五一年九月八日在旧金山签订的单独对日和约，破坏了国际协定并违反了和平的利益。
    这个违背中华人民共和国、苏联、印度和缅甸诸国人民的意志而签订的条约，丝毫不能有助于亚洲和平的建立。
    不仅如此，这个条约立即产生的后果，就是根据美日安全条约的规定，恢复日本的军国主义和在日本境内留驻外国军队。这使太平洋的战争危机严重地增长了。
    这个单独的对日和约打击日本人民的和平意志并破坏日本人民的主权，强迫他们接受重整军备的沉重负担。这个条约的无可避免的后果将是，日本的军国主义复活，日本人民的经济生活遭到破坏。
    世界和平理事会重申：要使对日和约真正具有效力，必须首先由中华人民共和国、美国、苏联和英国进行谈判，然后取得一切有关国家的同意。只有这样的条约，才能避免太平洋的战争危机，促使外国军队撤退，停止日本的重新军国主义化并对日本人民的和平发展有所贡献。
    相反地，强使菲律宾、澳大利亚和新西兰接受的军事公约，成为这些国家的人民肩上的一个无法负荷的重担，并威胁着世界和平。
    世界和平理事会祝贺日本人民的和平斗争，并敦促他们和邻国的人民共同努力，以求远东的和平能够恢复。
    世界和平理事会敦促一切赞助亚洲和太平洋区域的和平的人们——包括日本人民在内——在最早的适当日期，举行保卫和平的区域会议。这个会议的目的，是要使日本问题得以和平解决，从而消除对于世界和平的严重威胁。
    关于朝鲜问题的决议
    世界各族人民曾以非常热烈的希望，欢迎朝鲜停火谈判的开始。世界和平理事会执行局在赫尔辛基开会时就曾经提出警告说：如果想使以谈判解决问题的精神获得胜利，舆论必须警觉。四个月过去了，谈判却没有获得任何结果，这四个月的情形证明了那个警告是正确的。
    谈判在那些要扩大冲突的人们的影响下拖延下来，直到今天，猛烈战斗和流血破坏仍在继续着。
    只有在谈判中具有诚意和舆论的支持，才能产生一个结束敌对行动并使和平解决朝鲜问题成为可能的协议，这种和平解决将使朝鲜人民重新得到决定自己命运的权利。
    世界和平理事会要求从事敌对行动的各方尽速以在公平合理的基础上进行的和平谈判来解决朝鲜的冲突。世界和平理事会号召全世界各族人民支持这个要求。
    关于越南和东南亚的决议
    世界和平理事会根据联合国宪章的原则，一向认为各国人民有权解决他们自己的事务，并有权不受外界干涉而解决他们的冲突。世界和平理事会宣告，唯有实行这些原则，东南亚的潜在冲突和实际冲突才可能求得解决。
    世界和平理事会认为：在东南亚各地正在发展的冲突中，越南战争（老挝和柬埔寨的战争也包括在内）的发展正在增加新世界战争的危险。
    世界和平理事会号召立即在越南停火，并要求也开始进行谈判，以求得冲突的全面解决，这种解决应规定外国军队撤退。
    缅甸、菲律宾、马来亚等地一切潜在冲突及其他一切实际冲突，均应按照上述原则并以同样的措施来解决。
    关于近东和中东的决议
    近中东和北非的和平所遭到的威胁，已经严重地加剧了，因为这一区域的有关国家受到越来越厉害的军事和政治控制。然而，这种作法正遭到从伊朗到摩洛哥的人民的抵抗。这种作法违背了他们的意志，因为他们是决心取得经济和民族的独立，决心保卫和平的。
    世界和平理事会谴责那种强迫地中海区域的人民——近中东和北非的人民——接受军事公约的作法，认为这是对世界和平的严重威胁。
    外国军队现已源源开入埃及，埃及人被杀死在他们自己的领土上。埃及人民努力摆脱那些和他们主宰自己国家的权利不能相容的条约的负担，埃及人民的这个努力是正当的和正义的。
    近中东和北非的人民反对在他们的领土上驻扎外国军队，反对准许外国建立战略基地，反对强占他们的国家财富。伊朗人民的行动就是这种反抗的第一个具有决定意义的事例。这种越来越强烈的反对，是对于和平事业的极为重要的贡献。
    埃及人民拒绝参加那个意味着冒险和战争的公约。他们的行动加强了各国人民对于自己的信心，并对维护地中海区域的和平和全世界的和平的事业，作了非常宝贵的贡献。
    世界和平理事会要求：一切外国军队立即从埃及和苏丹撤退，以便后者能够自由地决定自己的命运。
    关于德国问题的决议
    没有和德国人民谘商就决定使西德重新军国主义化的华盛顿协议和渥太华协议，已使各国人民面对既成事实和非常危险的形势。
    纳粹主义在西德的复活，首先是分派给那些率领新“国防军”的希特勒旧将领的任务，对于整个世界、特别是对于德国及其邻国的人民来说，是严重的威胁。
    这种进行重新军国主义化、拒绝重建统一的爱好和平的德国、阻止德国人民就自己国家的统一问题采取决定、延长和加强外国军队的占领——这些，造成了国际不和的局势。
    我们号召各国人民警惕起来，采取行动，以确保四大国举行会议，与非军国主义化的、统一的、爱好和平的德国缔结能够保障欧洲和平的条约。
    我们以满意的心情指出德国公众抗议浪潮的日益增涨，我们欢迎各种不同的团体和个人反对武装德国和争取德国统一的活动。
    德国人民这个斗争对缔造和平是不可缺少的贡献，这个斗争必须与那些已被拖入扩张军备计划的各国人民的同样的努力汇合起来。这些国家的人民将和德国人民配合行动表现出他们的团结一致，从而确保和平解决的实现。
    世界和平理事会将鼓励和支持所有下述这种建议：
    德国和邻国的代表性人物会晤和开会会商。
    互派代表性人物进行文化和经济方面的访问。
    德国代表参加有助于和平事业的群众性活动。
    鉴于武装德国对于各国人民的威胁的严重性，世界和平理事会敦促有关各国的和平委员会把德国问题的和平解决和各该委员会其他一切保卫和平的活动紧密地联系起来。
