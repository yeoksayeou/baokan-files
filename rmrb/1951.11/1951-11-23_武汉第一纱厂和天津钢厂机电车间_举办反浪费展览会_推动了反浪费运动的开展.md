Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd -- The Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill and the Tianjin Steel Plant's Mechanical and Electrical Workshop have effectively promoted the anti-waste movement by holding exhibitions.

    Before the anti-waste exhibition, workers did not pay much attention to various waste phenomena, and even had a sense of complacency. Some workers at Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill said, "Our ideological awareness has been raised in the democratic reform movement, and there is no waste in the workshop." The exhibition shattered this complacency. The exhibition at Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill displayed flawed cloth and moldy yarn. On the flawed cloth was written: "From January to September of this year, the monthly average production of flawed cloth was 606 rolls, short-length cloth was 190 rolls, narrow-width cloth was 105 rolls, and moldy cloth was 7 rolls, resulting in a monthly loss of 27.24 million yuan, and a total loss of 217.92 million yuan in eight months." On the moldy yarn was written: "Due to the irresponsibility of administrative personnel, 170 pounds of 32-count yarn were ruined by mold. This yarn could only be sold at 60% of its original price, resulting in a loss of 1.83 million yuan." The anti-waste exhibition at Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill also used production charts to illustrate the workers' inventions, rationalization proposals, and production achievements after the workers learned the Hao Jianxiu work method, pointing out the direction of increasing production and practicing economy for the workers. Some workers at Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill said, "I felt very sad after seeing the exhibition, and I must find out the causes and responsibilities for the waste in the future." Others said, "The waste of moldy yarn is really heartbreaking, and I hope the administrative leadership will correct it in the future." The administrative leadership of Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill has now inspected and dealt with the issue of moldy yarn. In addition to the relevant personnel making self-criticisms, the administration has also repaired the skylights of the yarn warehouse and added windows to improve air circulation, and quickly packed the accumulated yarn to prevent further mold, in response to the causes of moldy yarn.

    In the past, in the Mechanical and Electrical Workshop of Tianjin Steel Plant, materials and tools such as gauze, files, and steel saw blades were often replaced with new ones before being fully used. There was no limit to the requisition of machine oil. This time, after seeing the exhibition, many workers spontaneously collected the waste products around them and brought them to the exhibition. Each group launched discussions, linking them to the waste phenomena in their own units, and studying methods to avoid waste. For example, the lathe group improved the operating method of steel saw blades, extending their service life. For the use of materials, the workshop负责人 [responsible person] has also designated a special person to be responsible for management and statistics.

    Now, the staff and workers of the Mechanical and Electrical Workshop of Tianjin Steel Plant have generally paid attention to saving materials, and the consumption of various materials has been reduced by 40% compared with the past, which can save 50,000 jin of millet every year.

    举办反浪费展览会
    推动了反浪费运动的开展
    【新华社二十二日讯】武汉市第一纱厂和天津钢厂机电车间用举办展览会的方法来推动反浪费运动的开展，收效很大。
    在举办反浪费展览会以前，职工们对于各方面的浪费现象不大注意，甚至还有自满情绪。武汉第一纱厂有些职工说：“在民主改革运动中，我们的思想觉悟都提高了，车间里已没有什么浪费现象。”展览会打破了这种自满思想。武汉第一纱厂的展览会上陈列着疵布和霉纱。疵布上写着：“从今年一月到九月每月平均出疵布六百零六匹、短码布一百九十匹、窄幅布一百零五匹、霉布七匹，每月损失二千七百二十四万元，八个月共损失两亿一千七百九十二万元。”霉纱上写着：“由于行政管理人员不负责，霉烂了一百七十磅三十二支纱，这些纱只能以六折价钱卖出去，损失了一百八十三万元。”第一纱厂的反浪费展览会还用生产图表说明工人的发明创造、合理化建议和工人们学习了郝建秀工作法后的生产成绩，为工人们指出了增产节约的方向。武汉第一纱厂有的工人说：“我看了展览会后心里很难过，今后一定要把造成浪费的原因和责任查出来。”有的说：“霉纱的浪费事件真叫人心痛，希望行政领导方面在今后改正。”第一纱厂行政领导方面现在已对霉纱的问题作了检查和处理。除有关人员作了检讨外，行政方面并针对造成霉纱原因，修理了纱仓的天窗，增开了窗户，使纱仓空气流通；又把积存的纱迅速打包，防止继续霉烂。
    天津钢厂机电车间过去纱布、锉刀、钢锯条等材料和工具往往没有充分使用就换了新的。机器油的领用是没有限制的。这次很多工人看了展览会后都自动地把自己周围的浪费品搜集起来拿去展览。各小组都展开讨论，联系自己单位的浪费现象，研究避免浪费的方法。如车工组改进了钢锯条的操作法，延长了使用期限。对于材料的使用，车间负责人也已指定专人负责管理和统计。
    现在天津钢厂机电车间职工已普遍注意节约用料，各种材料的消耗已比过去减少了百分之四十，这样每年可节省五万斤小米。
