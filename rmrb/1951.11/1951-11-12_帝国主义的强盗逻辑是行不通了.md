　　The Imperialist Robber Logic No Longer Works

    No ferocious robber dares to openly say that robbery, looting, arson, and murder are their inherent rights. However, British imperialism describes its acts of aggression and massacre against the Egyptian people as their "inviolable sacred rights." In a recent note presented to Egypt by the British government, it shamelessly and publicly labeled Egypt's decision to abolish the unequal Anglo-Egyptian treaty as an "illegal" and "unilateral" act, "completely violating the United Nations Charter," and that Egypt should be "responsible for any damage to the lives and property" of the British.

    Every clear-headed person cannot help but be astonished by the audacity with which the rulers of Downing Street have turned black into white. Who exactly is being illegal, and who is being unilateral? Is it Egypt, which is fully in line with the principles of the United Nations Charter and seeks national independence and autonomy, or is it Britain, which violates the UN Charter's requirement that "no threat or use of force" should be used to "violate the territorial integrity or political independence of any member state or country"? It is quite obvious that, while British troops still forcibly occupy the Suez Canal and the blood of the Egyptian people, gunned down by British troops in the streets of Ismailia, has not yet dried, it is impossible for British imperialism to convince others that its own actions are legal while others’ resistance is illegal.

    The imperialists, who are accustomed to turning black into white, should now open their eyes wider and take a closer look at this era: this is no longer an era in which imperialism can run rampant and bully others at will. The imperialist robber logic is absolutely untenable. Neither "Hastings"-type aircraft nor the "Mauritius" warship can frighten the Egyptian people, who are courageous in their pursuit of freedom and independence, and any rogue tactics of distorting right and wrong cannot, of course, conceal the crimes of the aggressors. Any brutal and despicable means employed by imperialism will only lead to one result: that the people will see the face of the aggressor more and more clearly and give it greater and greater blows until it is completely overthrown.

    The Egyptian people's successive and unyielding struggle is an example.

### 帝国主义的强盗逻辑是行不通了

　　帝国主义的强盗逻辑是行不通了
    任何凶恶的强盗，也不敢公然把打家劫舍与杀人放火说成是他们应有的权利，但是英国帝国主义却把它们侵略与屠杀埃及人民的行为，说成是它们“不可侵犯的神圣权利”。在英国政府最近向埃及提出的一个照会中，就是这样公开无耻地把埃及宣布废除英埃不平等条约的决定，说成是“非法”和“片面”的行为，是“完全违反联合国宪章”，并且应该对英国人的“生命和财产的任何损害负责”。
    每一个头脑清醒的人，都不禁要为唐宁街统治者们这种大胆的颠倒黑白的说法而吃惊。究竟谁是非法，谁是片面呢？是完全符合联合国宪章原则要求民族独立自主的埃及呢，还是违反联合国宪章所规定的“不得使用威胁或武力”去“侵害任何会员国或国家之领土完整或政治独立”的英国呢？事情是很明显的，在英国军队仍然强占着苏彝士运河的时候，在伊士美利亚街头被英军枪杀的埃及人民血迹未干的时候，英帝国主义要使别人相信它自己的行动为合法而别人的反抗为非法是无论怎样都说不通的。
    惯于颠倒黑白的帝国主义者们，现在应该把眼睛张大一点，仔细看一看这个时代了：现在已经不再是帝国主义可以横行霸道任意欺负别人的时代了，帝国主义的强盗逻辑已经绝对行不通了。什么“哈斯丁斯式”飞机和“毛里求斯”号军舰既吓不倒勇于争取自由独立的埃及人民，而任何颠倒是非的无赖手段，当然更掩盖不了侵略者的罪行。帝国主义任何凶暴和卑劣的手段，只会得到一个结果，那就是：人民会愈来愈看清楚侵略者的面貌而给它以愈来愈大的打击，直至把它彻底打倒为止。
    埃及人民前仆后继，不屈不挠的斗争，就是一个例子。
