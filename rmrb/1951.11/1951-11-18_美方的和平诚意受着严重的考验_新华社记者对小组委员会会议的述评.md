　　The US Side's Sincerity for Peace is Under Severe Test
    —Xinhua News Agency Reporter's Commentary on Subcommittee Meetings
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 17th] This agency's special correspondent reports from Kaesong: After more than twenty days of subcommittee meetings, the US negotiating representatives still refuse to determine a demarcation line and demilitarized zone to reach a ceasefire agreement in Korea.

    At the very moment when this most decisive step toward peace is on the agenda and itinerary, the US side refuses to take this step, which sharply illustrates how different the aims and results of the two sides' proposals are. This situation shows that the problem the two sides are encountering at the conference table is not merely when a fair and reasonable ceasefire agreement can be reached, but how to reach such an agreement and where to cease fire.

    Actually determining the ceasefire line is precisely the touchstone for testing whether any side is willing to stop fighting after both sides agree to the principle of withdrawing two kilometers each from the line of battle contact as the demarcation line. But the US representatives precisely dare not accept this test, they refuse to take this major step toward an early ceasefire in Korea. They talk emptily about determining specific demarcation lines and specific demilitarized zones at a specific time, and about resolving other agenda items as soon as possible. But the actual, concrete result is that they do nothing and solve no problems, because they harbor intentions that are diametrically opposed to what they consistently tell the public.

    The nature of these unspeakable intentions can be seen from the contradictory statements that the US representatives have consistently used to deceive the world. Outside the conference tent, they say that they have given up their demands on Kaesong and that the only problem hindering progress is a question of "when." Inside the conference tent, they have said more than once: As long as the October 25th proposal (which demanded more than 1,000 square kilometers of North Korean territory, including Kaesong) or the November 8th proposal (which still demanded Kaesong) is accepted, the demarcation line can be determined immediately. Otherwise, the demarcation line cannot be determined.

    The only remaining pretext the US representatives are now using to refuse to implement the provisions of the agenda and determine the demarcation line is a "de facto ceasefire," and even this pretext has been eliminated by the Korean-Chinese side. The Korean-Chinese representatives have made it clear that after the demarcation line and demilitarized zone are determined, they can still be revised according to the corresponding changes in the battle line before the signing of the ceasefire agreement. This clearly shows that the US side's deliberately distorting statement that once the demarcation line is determined, the troops of both sides will immediately withdraw from the line is a completely deceptive lie, because everyone knows very well that the withdrawal of troops and the ceasefire on the ground, in the air, and at sea will only occur after the ceasefire agreement is signed and takes effect. The American generals are welcome to try to change the battle line and bear the consequences, as long as they are not afraid of encountering defeat and loss. The only thing that keeps them from doing so is their own fear—the condemnation of public opinion, the desire of their soldiers and UN soldiers to cease fire and return home, and the lessons of their summer and autumn offensives.

    The Panmunjom peace talks have encountered the most serious test since the resumption of the ceasefire talks. Accepting the proposal of the Korean-Chinese representatives would immediately determine the location of the cessation of fighting, which could be changed when the ceasefire agreement is signed. After laying this foundation for the cessation of fighting, the plenary session could immediately proceed to resolve other issues, such as the issue of the release of prisoners of war, which would then become a reality.

    If the US representatives are allowed to do as they please, the issue of the release of prisoners of war and other issues on the agenda will become empty talk, because the issue of determining the demarcation line (the place where the fighting stops) will be delayed indefinitely until the American generals get what they cannot get at the conference table. If they don't get it, they will still break off the peace talks at any time. The US side's proposal will make the agenda—the only result of four months of peace talks—a scrap of paper and delay the signing of the ceasefire agreement at the will of the US government.

    The eyes of the world are now on Panmunjom, watching whether the US representatives will continue to delay the rapid resolution of the demarcation line issue at the expense of destroying the entire agenda in order to achieve America's aggressive aims. The US negotiating representatives' sincerity in seeking an early peace in Korea is now being tested, the most serious test is whether they are willing to immediately determine the demarcation line and demilitarized zone.

　　美方的和平诚意受着严重的考验
    ——新华社记者对小组委员会会议的述评
    【新华社十七日讯】本社特派记者自开城报道：在举行了二十多天的小组委员会会议以后，美方谈判代表仍拒绝确定分界线和非军事区来达成朝鲜的停战协议。
    在这个走向和平的最有决定性的步骤列在日程和议程上的时候，美方不肯采取这种步骤，这尖锐地说明双方的建议的目的和结果是怎样的不同。这种情况说明双方在会议桌上碰到的问题不只是什么时候能够达成公平合理的停战协议的问题，而是怎样达成这种协议以及在那里停战的问题。
    实际确定停火线正是考验任何一方是否愿在双方商定把战斗接触线作为分界线各自撤退两公里的原则以后停止战斗的试金石。但是美方代表恰恰不敢接受这种考验，他们拒绝采取这种在朝鲜早日停战的重大步骤。他们空谈在具体时间划定具体的分界线和具体的非军事区，以及早日解决其他议程项目。但是实际的具体结果是他们什么事情都不做，什么问题都没有解决，因为他们怀有与他们一贯向公众说的话相差十万八千里的意图。
    这种不敢告人的意图的性质可以从美方代表一直用来欺骗世界的自相矛盾的说法中看出来。他们在会议帐篷外面说，他们放弃了对开城的要求，妨碍进展的唯一问题是“什么时候”这样一个问题。他们在会议帐篷里面不止一次地说：只要接受十月二十五日的建议（这个建议索取包括开城在内的一千多平方公里的北朝鲜土地），或者十一月八日的建议（这个建议仍然索取开城），立即就可以确定分界线。否则就不能确定分界线。
    美方代表现在用来拒绝执行议程的规定和确定分界线的剩下来的唯一藉口是“事实上的停火”，甚至连这个藉口也被朝中方面消除了。朝中代表已明白说，分界线和非军事区在确定之后，仍然能够根据签订停战协议以前战线所起的相应变化加以修正。这清楚地说明美方所谓一旦确定分界线双方军队立即从该线撤退这种故意歪曲事实的说法完全是骗人的谎言，因为大家知道得很清楚，撤退军队和在地面上、空中和海上停火只有在停战协议签字并生效以后才会出现。美国将军们只要不怕遭遇失败和损失，满可以尝试改变战线，并承担其后果。使他们裹足不前的唯一东西是他们自己的畏惧——舆论的指责、他们的士兵和联合国士兵想停战回国的愿望以及他们的夏季攻势和秋季攻势的教训。
    板门店的和平谈判碰到了停战会议恢复以来的最严重的考验。接受朝中代表的建议就可以立即确定停止战斗的位置，这种位置在签订停战协议时可以加以变更。在打下这种停止战斗的基础以后，全体会议就可以立即进而解决其他问题，例如届时将成为当时的现实问题的释放战俘问题。
    如果听任美方代表随心所欲的话，释放战俘问题以及议程上的其他问题将变成空谈，因为确定分界线（战斗停止的地方）的问题将无限期地拖延下去，直到美国将军们得到他们在会议桌上无法得到的东西时为止，如果他们得不到这种东西的话，他们仍然会随时使和平谈判破裂。美方的建议将使议程——四个月的和平谈判的唯一成果——成为废纸，并把停战协议的签订随美国政府的心意拖延下去。
    全世界的眼睛现在都注视着板门店，看美方代表会不会不惜破坏整个议程继续拖延分界线问题的迅速解决，以实现美国的侵略目的。美方谈判代表寻求朝鲜的早日和平的诚意现在受到了考验，最严重的考验是他们是否愿意立即确定分界线和非军事区。
