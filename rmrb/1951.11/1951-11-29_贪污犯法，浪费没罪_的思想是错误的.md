    The Idea That "Corruption is Illegal, Waste is Not a Crime" is Wrong
    To inspect and report all large and small acts of waste, and to block the loopholes that damage state property, is an important part of carrying out the movement for increased production and thrift.

    After the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China made a mobilization report on carrying out streamlining and frugality to all directly affiliated organs, it began with the leading organs and carried out a preliminary inspection. During the inspection, a root cause of waste was discovered, namely, some comrades believed that "corruption is illegal, but waste is not a crime." This idea has also been found in other parts of the country. They believe that "waste is just that the work has not been done well, it is nothing, it can be forgiven." The reasons given by these comrades are nothing more than "although state property has been wasted, it is not for personal enjoyment after all" and "no one can avoid making mistakes due to lack of work experience." Under the domination of these ideas, in many areas, the phenomenon of waste is allowed to exist and develop.

    According to partial materials revealed by certain organs at the provincial level in Hebei Province, it can be proved how serious the harm of waste to the interests of the country and the people is. The Water Conservancy Department of the People's Government of Hebei Province wasted more than 10,000 catties of millet in the preparatory work of an irrigation project alone due to sloppy construction. The refrigerators bought by the Health Department from private merchants all turned out to be faulty, wasting 90 million yuan. The onions shipped to the Northeast by the Native Products Company were not inspected in time, and as a result, they all became moldy, resulting in a loss of more than 140 million yuan. The dried fish factory led by the Aquatic Products Bureau lost more than 140 million yuan due to the irresponsibility of leading cadres. The inspection of waste by the provincial organs of Hebei Province has just begun, but so many "100 million" yuan worth of waste has already been discovered. What an alarming figure! And even more serious is that these phenomena are so widespread. If this loophole is not plugged, how can we talk about increasing production and practicing economy?

    Corruption is illegal because it directly harms the interests of the state and the people. But how can waste be legal? Article 18 of the Common Program clearly stipulates: "All state organs of the People's Republic of China must strictly implement the revolutionary work style of honesty, simplicity, and serving the people, severely punish corruption, prohibit waste, and oppose the bureaucratic work style of being divorced from the masses." The state law stipulates "prohibition" for the phenomenon of waste, which means that the existence of all waste phenomena is illegal and must be prohibited. If it is allowed to exist, it is a violation of the Common Program.

    The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has led the direct organs to inspect extravagance and waste, and has achieved preliminary results. Many comrades have reversed the erroneous idea of neglecting the struggle against waste, and realized that waste and corruption are both serious harmful behaviors to the country. Some departments have formulated plans for increasing production and practicing economy, and some have established special institutions to inventory their assets, which are all necessary. The experience of the anti-corruption struggle in the Northeast tells us that leading organs must conscientiously organize the study of documents and use the documents as weapons to mobilize the masses to carry out democratic inspections. Only a mass inspection movement can thoroughly eliminate the phenomenon of corruption and waste, and rapidly develop the movement for increasing production and practicing economy.

### “贪污犯法，浪费没罪”的思想是错误的

    “贪污犯法，浪费没罪”的思想是错误的
    检查和检举一切大的、小的浪费行为，堵住损害国家财产的口子，是开展增产节约运动的重要一环。
    中共河北省委向直属各机关作了有关开展精简节约的动员报告后，即从领导机关做起，开展了初步检查。在检查中发现了产生浪费现象的一个思想根源，即有的同志认为“贪污犯法，浪费没罪”。这种思想在全国其他地区同样也发现了。他们认为：“浪费只是工作没有作好而已，不算什么，是可以原谅的。”这些同志所持的理由不外是“虽然浪费了国家财产，但毕竟不是为了个人享受”，“工作没有经验，谁也免不了犯错误”。就在这些思想支配下，在很多地区，浪费现象是一任其存在和发展着的。
    根据河北省省级某些机关揭发出来的局部材料，可以证明浪费对国家和人民利益的危害是多么严重。河北省人民政府水利厅由于施工草率，只在一处引河工程的准备工作上就浪费了一万多斤小米。卫生厅向私商买的冰箱，结果全有毛病，也浪费了九千万元。土产公司运往东北的洋葱，因为没有及时进行检查，结果都霉坏了，损失了一亿四千多万元。水产局领导的干鱼厂，因领导干部不负责任，损失了一亿四千多万元。河北省省级机关对浪费现象的检查刚在开始，但是已经发现这么多的“一亿”元的浪费，这是何等惊人的数字！而且更严重的是这些现象是如此普遍地存在着。如果不堵住这个漏洞，增产节约又从何谈起？
    贪污是犯法的，因为贪污直接地危害着国家和人民的利益。但是浪费又何尝是合法的呢？共同纲领第十八条明白地规定着：“中华人民共和国的一切国家机关，必须厉行廉洁的，朴素的，为人民服务的革命工作作风，严惩贪污，禁止浪费，反对脱离人民群众的官僚主义作风。”对于浪费现象，国家法律规定的是“禁止”，这就是说，一切浪费现象的存在都是不合法的，必须加以禁止。如果任其存在，那便是违背共同纲领的行为。
    中共河北省委领导各直属机关检查铺张浪费，已经得到初步效果，很多同志已经扭转了忽视对浪费现象作斗争的错误思想，认识到浪费同贪污都是对国家的严重危害行为。有的部门订出了增产节约计划，有的建立了专门机构清点家务，这些都是必要的。东北反贪污斗争的经验告诉我们：领导机关必须认真组织学习文件，并以文件作为武器来发动群众开展民主检查，只有群众性的检查运动，才能彻底消除贪污浪费现象，使增产节约运动迅速得到发展。
