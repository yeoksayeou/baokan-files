　　Qingdao Public and Private Cotton Textile Factories
    Universally Inspect the Promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method
    The eight state-owned cotton textile factories and the private Huaxin Yarn Factory in Qingdao conducted a universal inspection of the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method in September and October. This inspection was carried out by the Qingdao Committee of the China Textile Trade Union and the Qingdao Branch of the East China Textile Administration Bureau, who selected trade union cadres, technicians, and outstanding workers to form inspection teams, which cooperated with the factory inspection teams to conduct inspections and measurements, and to promote the establishment of regular inspection systems in each factory.
    The results of this inspection prove that the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method in each factory has achieved great success. The licker-in waste rate in each factory has decreased month by month, and most of the fine yarn workers have also learned and conscientiously implemented the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. According to statistics at the end of September, among the 2,231 machine operators in the above-mentioned factories, 39 percent were proficient in the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, of which 72 were close to or had broken the Hao Jianxiu licker-in waste rate; 49 percent had learned the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, and only 12 percent had not learned or were learning poorly.
    This inspection also proved that the promotion work is not just a technical education work, but should be combined with political and ideological education work. For example, the Huang Renmei group in the fine yarn workshop of the state-owned Qingdao Cotton Textile Factory No. 5 used to produce an average of 61 pounds of licker-in waste every ten hours. When the Hao Jianxiu Work Method was first promoted, some workers complained that the machines were not easy to use. Some said, "Even if Hao Jianxiu came to see our factory's machines, they would still produce more licker-in waste." After patriotic ideological education, the Huang Renmei group revised the patriotic pact at the beginning of August, with the first clause being "In order to donate airplanes and cannons, resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, consolidate national defense, and ensure that the daily licker-in waste does not exceed 17 pounds." Through the efforts of all the workers in the group, the average daily licker-in waste produced by the whole group in August was reduced to 16.9 pounds, a decrease of 72 percent compared to before. Now no one in the group says the machines are not easy to use.
    During this inspection, the inspection team also found that individual factories had relaxed their leadership in the promotion work. Some workers have developed complacency, believing that "they have learned almost enough." For example, because the state-owned Qingdao Cotton Textile Factory No. 1 had not seriously inspected the work situation after the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method in the past, more than 17 percent of the machine operators in the factory have not learned or are learning poorly recently. Many factories have not yet established a sound reward system. For example, some factories only pay attention to commending workers who produce less licker-in waste, but lack commendation for workers with poor technical foundations who work very hard. Now each factory is paying attention to solving these problems. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 青岛各公私营棉纺织厂  普遍检查郝建秀工作法推广工作

　　青岛各公私营棉纺织厂
    普遍检查郝建秀工作法推广工作
    青岛市八个国营棉纺织厂和私营华新纱厂，在九、十两月中普遍检查了郝建秀工作法的推广工作。这次检查工作是由中国纺织工会青岛市委员会和华东纺织管理局青岛分局抽调工会干部、技术人员、优秀工人等组成检查组，协同各厂检查小组进行检查、测定，并推动各厂建立经常性的检查制度。
    这次检查的结果证明，各厂推广郝建秀工作法已有很大成绩。各厂的皮辊花率已逐月下降，大部分细纱工人也已学会并认真实行了郝建秀工作法。据九月底的统计，在上述各厂的二千二百三十一个看车工人中，精通郝建秀工作法的占百分之三十九，其中接近或突破郝建秀皮辊花率的有七十二人；已学会郝建秀工作法的占百分之四十九，不会和学习较差的只占百分之十二。
    这次检查也证明，推广工作不只是一件技术教育工作，应该和政治思想教育工作结合进行。如国营青岛棉纺五厂细纱车间黄人美小组，过去每十小时平均出皮辊花六十一磅。在开始推广郝建秀工作法时，有些工人就埋怨车子不好使。有的说：“就叫郝建秀来看咱厂的车，也得多出皮辊花。”经过爱国主义思想教育后，黄人美小组在八月初修订了爱国公约，头一条就是“为了捐献飞机大炮，抗美援朝，巩固国防，保证每日皮辊花不超过十七磅。”经过全组工人的努力，八月份全组平均每天所出皮辊花就降低到十六点九磅，较前减少了百分之七十二。现在全组没有一个人说车子不好使了。
    检查组在这次检查中也发现个别工厂对推广工作有放松领导的现象。部分工人已产生自满情绪，认为“学的差不多了”。如国营青岛棉纺一厂由于过去没有认真检查推广郝建秀工作法后的工作情况，全厂的看车工人中最近没有学会或学习很差的仍占百分之十七以上。很多厂还没有建立一套健全的奖励制度。如有的厂只注意表扬少出皮辊花的工人，但对技术基础较差却很努力的工人就缺少表扬。现在各厂正注意解决这些问题。（新华社）
