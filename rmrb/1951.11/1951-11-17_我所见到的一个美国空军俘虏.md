　　An American Air Force Prisoner I Saw
    Yang Liben
    On the evening of October 16th, I escorted a dejected prisoner, Robert Gillett, to the prisoner of war camp. Gillett was a lieutenant pilot in the U.S. Marine Corps Air Wing. Three days earlier, his "F7F" night fighter was shot down over a certain area in Korea. The shattered wreckage remained in the mountains and fields near the highway.

    Gillett, speaking of the declining state of American "air superiority," said, "Your anti-aircraft fire is getting more and more intense. It's becoming difficult for our planes to operate safely at night. Since May of this year, our squadron has been losing several planes every day. Some of the planes that return are riddled with bullets. When the pilots get on the ground, they tell stories everywhere of their adventures. So now, every time we go out, we jump into the cockpit with a sense of fear and sorrow. Everyone thinks this way: maybe this time we will be saying goodbye to our mothers and lovers forever." He spoke in a low voice. This American air pirate, whose hands were covered with the blood of the Korean people, had become a ridiculous coward.

    From the starting point to the prisoner of war camp, we took a car for a stretch. On the way, enemy planes came and dropped eight flares over an open area ahead. Our car sped towards the illuminated area like an arrow, followed by a large number of cars. Gillett was extremely frightened during these few minutes, now sitting up, now crouching down, now lying down, even afraid to look up at the flares. When the car drove out of the illuminated area and the speed gradually decreased, Gillett breathed a sigh of relief and murmured, "Although the roads here are much better than in southern Korea, I still feel it would be safer to drive after the flares have landed." He was puzzled by our driver's bold action to break through the enemy's "blockade."

    When we got out of the car and walked onto the mountain road leading to the prisoner of war camp, countless trucks carrying military supplies were speeding towards the southern front. After seeing this, Gillett said to me, "Our air force simply has no way to deal with your transportation lines."

### 我所见到的一个美国空军俘虏

　　我所见到的一个美国空军俘虏
    杨立本
    十月十六日晚上，我押送一个神情沮丧的俘虏罗伯·吉勒特到俘虏收容站去。吉勒特是美国海军陆战队航空队的一个中尉驾驶员。三天之前，他驾驶的“F7F”夜间战斗机在朝鲜某地的上空被击落。支离破碎的机骸还留在公路附近的山野里。
    吉勒特谈到美军 “空中优势”日趋没落的情形时说：“你们的高射炮火愈来愈厉害了。我们的飞机晚上出来也难保安全。自从今年五月以后，我们队里每天总有几架飞机一去不回了。有些回来的飞机也都是弹痕累累。这些飞机的驾驶员一到地上，便到处讲述自己的历险经过。因此，现在我们每次出动的时候，都怀着一种恐惧和悲哀的心情跳进机舱。大家都这样想：也许这次就要和自己的母亲、爱人永远别离了。”他用低沉的声调说着。这个双手涂满了朝鲜人民的鲜血的美国空中强盗，这时已成了一个可笑的怕死鬼了。
    从出发地到俘虏收容站，我们乘汽车走了一段路。在半路上，敌人的飞机来了，在前面有一片开阔地的上空，投下了八颗照明弹。我们的汽车飞一般地冲向照明区，跟在后面的还奔驰着一大批汽车。吉勒特在这几分钟内被吓得紧张极了，忽而坐起，忽而伏下，忽而卧倒，甚至不敢抬头望一望照明弹。当汽车驶出照明区，速度渐渐减慢的时候，吉勒特才松了一口气，嗫嚅地说：“虽然这儿公路比朝鲜南部的好得多，但我总觉得等照明弹落地以后车子再走，比较安全一些。”他对我们司机突破敌机“封锁”的果敢行动，感到迷惑难解。
    当我们跳下汽车，走上向俘虏收容站去的山道时，无数辆载着军用物资的运输汽车，正飞快地驰向南方前线。吉勒特看到后对我说：“我们的空军简直没有办法对付你们这样的运输线。”
