    Retail Liquor Dealers Should Not Be Made to Redo Signboards
    Editor: I am a shop employee. I have something to tell you. Recently, the Changxindian Exclusive Sales Office of the Beijing Branch of the Liquor Industry Exclusive Sales Company held a group leader meeting. According to the person in charge of the Exclusive Sales Office, the Beijing Branch instructed that all retail liquor dealers in the city must make a liquor selling signboard. This signboard is required to be 48 inches long and 11 inches wide. After the group leaders inquired with the lumber mill, this signboard, including labor, materials, and paint, costs 63,000 yuan. I think this is completely unnecessary. Because this summer, liquor dealers in the Changxindian area already made unified signboards, which are 3 Chinese feet long and 6 Chinese inches wide, with white characters on a black background and a red five-pointed star at the top, making the liquor dealers quite visible already. If they are remade now, it will not be a problem for some large businesses, but it will be very difficult for many small stallholders. Now that the government is calling for increased production and thrift, the instruction to redo the signboards is not in line with the spirit of thrift of the People's Government. Taking the Changxindian area alone, with more than 80 retail liquor dealers, at 63,000 yuan per signboard, it would waste more than 5 million yuan in Renminbi. Using this money for resisting America and aiding Korea would increase our strength. Therefore, I suggest that the instruction to redo the signboards be withdrawn.

### 不应该让零售酒商重做招牌

    不应该让零售酒商重做招牌
    编辑同志：我是一个店员工人。我有一件事要告诉你。最近酒业专卖公司北京分公司长辛店专卖处召开了一个小组长会议，据专卖处负责人谈，北京分公司指示，全市零销酒商，每户都要做一个卖酒招牌。这块招牌，规定长四十八吋，宽十一吋。经小组长向木厂询问，这块招牌，连工加料和油漆，需要六万三千元。我认为这是完全不必要的。因为今年夏季长辛店地区酒商已做了统一的招牌。长三市尺宽六市寸，白底黑字，最上端还有红五星，酒商的目标已经很大。现在要是重做，一些大商号还无问题，可是有很多的小摊商就感到十分困难。现在政府正号召增产节约，重做招牌的指示，和人民政府节约的精神是不符合的。仅以长辛店地区来说，八十多户零销酒商，按每个招牌六万三千元计算，即需浪费人民币五百多万元，把这些钱用在抗美援朝上，便能增加一份力量。所以，我建议把这个重做招牌的指示撤回。
