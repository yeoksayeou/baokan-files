    Zhangjiakou Organs Inspect Embezzlement and Waste
    Raising Cadre Awareness and Improving Work
    The Zhangjiakou Municipal People's Supervision Committee, the Municipal People's Court, and the Finance Bureau convened an anti-embezzlement and anti-waste conference on August 2nd. 554 secretaries, accountants, managers, and personnel cadres from various organs, organizations, and public enterprises participated. The main content of the meeting was: The court summarized 24 embezzlement cases and pronounced sentences of varying degrees of severity for the embezzlement crimes of four cadres from the Industry and Commerce Federation. Director Deng of the Finance Bureau examined and reviewed the phenomenon of waste from the perspective of the financial system. Deputy Director Lu of the Municipal People's Supervision Committee, based on the spirit of the People's Daily editorial of July 27th, analyzed the causes of embezzlement and waste from the perspective of cadres themselves and leadership, and pointed out future improvement measures.
    On August 25th, units in the culture and education, health, and public security systems all held discussions and wrote summaries. Other units, such as the People's Construction Company, the Transportation Company, the Limin Leather Factory, the Municipal Hospital, and the Water Company, also wrote summaries individually. From all the reports, the vast majority of units have mobilized all cadres to conduct serious discussions and have formulated improvement measures.
    This conference and the discussions in each unit have played a significant role in clarifying cadre thinking and improving work.
    First, cadres faced reality squarely and exposed many phenomena of waste. In larger aspects, the People's Construction Company, for example, inspected eight projects and six sections and divisions, and found that serious waste was caused by carelessness and irresponsibility. In smaller aspects, from pen nibs to office supplies, living supplies, and building repairs, there was waste in general. Its manifestations are as follows: buying items cheaply, only to find that they cannot be used, and having to buy them again; poor planning, purchasing items that are not used, leaving them to deteriorate; buying expensive goods instead of cheaper ones for convenience, knowing that it is a losing proposition; irresponsible review of printed materials, resulting in large quantities being discarded after printing; not cherishing public property, such as using chairs as cradles, and having the government buy them again when they are broken. In addition, the Heyan Street Police Station falsified a budget for repairing toilets in order to plaster the ceiling; the Municipal Hospital did not cherish medicines and massively injected penicillin even for tonsillitis, resulting in waste.
    In this work of inspecting embezzlement and waste, cadres have raised their political awareness. Through study and discussion, some people have realized that embezzlement is not only a matter of personal character but also a counter-revolutionary act; it is absolutely necessary for the government to adopt a serious attitude to deal with it. Some people believe that embezzlement and waste are not only an economic loss to the country and the people, but the political loss is also unimaginable. At the same time, personal corruption, embezzlement, waste, and recklessness will also affect social order. Therefore, the crime of embezzlement is unforgivable.
    Regarding future improvement opinions, all reports unanimously believe that: patriotic education must be strengthened among cadres, cultivating the virtue of cherishing state property, opposing irresponsible bureaucracy, establishing a strict inspection system, and launching the masses to resolutely struggle against all embezzlement and waste phenomena. Some units also proposed welcoming the People's Supervision Committee to continuously inspect work in order to correct mistakes and shortcomings in a timely manner.

    张家口各机关检查贪污浪费
    提高了干部觉悟改进了工作
    张家口市人民监察委员会与市人民法院、财政局于八月二日召开了反贪污浪费大会。各机关、团体、公营企业的秘书、会计、管理人员以及人事干部五百五十四人参加。会议主要内容为：法院总结了二十四件贪污案，并分别轻重宣判了工商联合会四个干部的贪污罪行。财政局邓局长从财政制度上检查和检讨了浪费现象。市人民监察委员会芦副主任根据七月二十七日人民日报社论的精神，从干部本身和领导方面分析造成贪污浪费的原因，并指出了今后改进办法。
    八月二十五日，文教、卫生、公安系统中的各单位都进行讨论，写出总结。其他单位如人民建筑公司、搬运公司、利民皮厂、市立医院、自来水公司等十五处也单独写了总结。从所有报告中看，绝大多数单位都已发动全体干部认真地进行了讨论，并订出了改进办法。
    此次大会及各单位的讨论，对澄清干部思想，改进工作起作用很大。
    首先，干部正视了现实，揭发了很多浪费现象。大的方面，如人民建筑公司这次检查了八项工程和六个科、股，就发现由于粗枝大叶不负责任而造成了严重的浪费。小的方面，从钢笔尖到办公用具、生活用具、修建房屋，总起来说都有浪费。其表现形式如下：购买物品图贱，买来不能用，重买；计划不周，购置的物品未用，放置起来，任其败坏；同样货物，为了近便，明知吃亏，买贵的不买贱的；印刷品不负责审查，印出后大批作废；不爱惜公物，如把椅子当摇车，坏了由公家再买。此外，河沿街派出所为了糊顶棚而假造了修厕所的预算；市立医院对药品不加珍惜，扁桃腺炎也大量注射盘尼西林，形成浪费。
    在这次检查贪污浪费的工作中，干部提高了政治认识。通过学习讨论，有些人认清了贪污不仅是个人品质问题，同时也是反革命行为；政府采取严肃态度予以处理是非常必要的。有人认为贪污浪费不仅是国家人民的经济损失，而在政治上的损失也不堪设想。同时由于个人的生活腐化，贪污浪费，胡作非为，也会影响社会治安。所以，贪污罪行，是不可饶恕的。
    对于今后的改进意见，各个报告中一致认为：在干部中必须加强爱国主义教育，树立爱护国家财产的美德，反对不负责任的官僚主义，建立严格的检查制度，并发动群众对一切贪污浪费现象作坚决的斗争。有的单位还提出欢迎人民监察委员会不断地来检查工作，以便及时纠正错误和缺点。
