	Beating Wives and Any Acts Infringing on Women's Personal Freedom Are Illegal Acts
	The occurrence of cases like Hua Bei University of Technology Deputy Dean Zeng Yi beating his ex-wife Wang Yizhi and two other incidents, indicates that in some revolutionary organs, schools, and even among some senior veteran cadres and veteran party members, feudalistic ideas of male superiority over females still remain, manifesting as barbaric and backward behaviors of beating women and infringing upon their personal freedom. It is completely necessary to publicly try these criminals and give them the legal punishment they deserve. Without doing so, we cannot effectively implement the Marriage Law and cannot thoroughly eradicate the above-mentioned barbaric and backward phenomena, guaranteeing women full and equal freedom rights with men.
	In the old society, incidents such as beating and scolding women and other infringements on women's personal freedom were generally ignored, and the courts naturally would not interfere in these matters to protect women's rights. However, in a new democratic society, such criminal behavior cannot be tolerated at all, and criminals must be punished according to national law in order to ensure true equality between men and women. From this, we should further realize that any article of law must be fully complied with, and no one is allowed to violate it. All cadres and the masses who have behaviors of beating and scolding women and infringing on their personal freedom should immediately and resolutely correct their mistakes. For those who are unwilling to quickly correct their mistakes or have been accused, the people's court must handle them according to law, and select typical cases to organize public trials to educate the broad masses of cadres and the masses.

    打老婆和任何侵犯妇女人身自由的行为都是犯法行为
    华北大学工学院副院长曾毅殴打前妻王益智等三案的发生，说明在若干革命的机关、学校甚至若干较高级的老干部、老党员中，也残留着男尊女卑的封建思想、并表现为野蛮落后的殴打妇女和侵犯妇女人身自由的行为。对于这些犯罪者进行公审并给予应得的法律惩处，是完全必要的。不这样，就不能有效地贯彻实现婚姻法，就不能彻底肃清上述野蛮落后的现象，保证妇女获得完全的与男子平等的自由权利。
    在旧社会，像打骂妇女和其他侵犯妇女人身自由之类的事件，一般是无人过问的，法院自然也不会去干涉这些事情，以保障妇女权利。但是，在新民主主义的社会里，则完全不能容许这种犯罪行为的发生，而必须按照国家法律对犯罪者予以惩处，以便保证男女的真正平等。由此，我们应该进一步认识法律上的任何条文都是必须完全遵守，而不容许任何人违犯的。一切干部和群众，凡是有打骂妇女和侵犯妇女人身自由的行为的，都应该马上坚决改正错误。对于不肯迅速改正错误或已被控告的，人民法院必须依法处理，并选择典型，组织公开审判，以教育广大干部和群众。
