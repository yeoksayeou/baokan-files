    The bumper harvest in the Tuan Mountain area of Xuancheng County, Southern Anhui Province, this year is due to the extensive farmland water conservancy projects built by the broad masses of farmers. The experience of the Tuan Mountain area proves that farmers are very enthusiastic about building water conservancy projects after the land reform. Developing mass-based farmland water conservancy is an effective way to prevent drought and flood.
    Tuan Mountain area is mountainous. The paddy fields mainly rely on more than two thousand reservoirs of various sizes scattered throughout the area for water storage and irrigation. These reservoirs were already in disrepair before liberation, and they would be "full after three days of rain and dry after seven days without rain," unable to serve their purpose of storing water for irrigation. In times of drought, there was no water in the ponds, but when the rain was heavy, the fields were flooded. For many years, the Tuan Mountain area was often hit by droughts and floods. Last year, there was no rain in the Tuan Mountain area for more than forty days, and the ponds were so dry that their bottoms were exposed, resulting in a general poor harvest throughout the area.
    Before liberation, the farmers in the Tuan Mountain area wanted to repair all the ponds and dams carefully. However, at that time, the Kuomintang reactionary government only cared about plundering, and the landlords only cared about collecting rent. No one cared about water conservancy. The farmers were willing but powerless, and their hearts were not united, so they did not achieve any results in their repairs. Last winter, around the time when land reform began in the Tuan Mountain area, Hui Junfeng, the county magistrate of Xuancheng County, came to the area to lead the farmers in repairing the ponds and dams. The land reform work team also mobilized the masses and led the farmers to work. At that time, a water conservancy committee was established throughout the area, and village engineering offices were established in each village. The farmers organized one hundred and fifty-four pond and dam engineering teams, and started repairing the ponds and dams while carrying out land reform. According to everyone's regulations, the farmers helped each other, first repairing the stagnant water ponds and dams that irrigated more fields, and then repairing the flowing water ponds and dams that irrigated fewer fields. They helped the families of revolutionary martyrs, the families of revolutionary soldiers, and the elderly, widowed, and disabled farmers who had no labor force. The people's government provided loans to support five of the larger pond and dam projects. In this way, by the end of March this year, two thousand one hundred and forty-seven ponds and dams of various sizes had been repaired throughout the area, increasing the water storage capacity of the ponds and dams by one to two times, ensuring the irrigation of more than 53,000 mu of farmland.
    In order to properly manage and maintain these repaired ponds and dams, the people's government also helped the farmers establish fifty-nine pond and dam renovation and management committees. Even small ponds were managed by a team or a dedicated person. In the past, farmers often had disputes over water. This time, the people's government also helped everyone establish a water use principle, which stipulated: 1. Use the water from the smaller ponds first. 2. When there is sufficient water, release water to the nearby and higher fields first, and then to the distant and lower fields. 3. When there is a shortage of water, first use the water stored in the fields to adjust each other, and try to retain the water stored in the ponds; if necessary, abandon the irrigation of green seedlings and late rice to protect the early rice. 4. In the event of mountain floods and torrents, all young and middle-aged farmers will be mobilized to guard the large ponds and dams.
    Having repaired the ponds and dams and expanded the irrigated area, although the Tuan Mountain area was as dry as last year for about forty days this year, the entire area achieved a bumper harvest. Last year, the average rice yield per mu of paddy field in the Tuan Mountain area was 120 jin. This year, the average yield per mu was 350 jin, an increase of nearly two times. In total, the entire area produced more than 13 million jin of rice more this year than last year.

### 皖南区宣城团山区农民  兴修水利今年得到丰收

    皖南区宣城团山区农民
    兴修水利今年得到丰收
    皖南区宣城县团山区今年的丰收，是广大农民兴修农田水利得来的。团山区的经验证明：土地改革后农民对兴修水利很积极；发展群众性的农田水利事业，是防旱和防涝的有效办法。
    团山区是山地，稻田主要依靠散布在全区的二千多个大小水塘蓄水灌溉。这些水塘在解放前就已经坏了，“有雨三天满，无雨七日干”，不能起蓄水灌溉的作用。旱的时候塘里无水，雨大了却又淹田，多年来，团山区常发生旱灾和涝灾。去年团山区有四十多天没有下雨，旱得塘底朝天，结果全区普遍歉收。
    解放以前，团山区农民就想把所有塘坝认真修一遍。但是，那时候国民党反动政府只管搜刮，地主只管催租，谁也不管水利。农民有心无力，人心不齐，修也没有修出成绩。去年冬天，团山区开始实行土地改革的前后，宣城县县长惠峻峰到了该区，领导农民修塘坝。土地改革工作队也一面发动群众，一面领导农民兴工。当时，全区成立了一个水利委员会，各村成立了村工务所，农民组织了一百五十四个塘坝工务组，与进行土地改革同时，动手修塘修坝。农民根据大家的规定，互相帮助，先修死水塘和灌溉田多的塘坝，后修活水塘和灌溉田少的塘坝。对革命烈士家属、革命军人家属和鳏寡孤独没有劳动力的农户，大家帮助他们。有五处塘坝工程较大，人民政府就予以贷款扶持。这样，今年三月底，全区就修复了大小塘坝二千一百四十七处，使全区塘坝的蓄水量增加了一倍到两倍，保证了五万三千多亩农田的灌溉。
    为了好好管理和养护这些修好的塘坝，人民政府又帮助农民成立了五十九个塘坝整修管理委员会。小的水塘也有一个小组或一个专人来加以管理。过去农民常因争水发生纠纷，这次人民政府又帮助大家订了一个用水原则，规定：一、先用小塘的水。二、足水时先给近田和高田放水，后给远田和低田放水。三、缺水时先用田里的存水互相调剂，尽量保留塘内存水；必要时放弃青苗、晚稻的灌溉，保住早稻。四、遇山洪暴发时，全体青壮农民出动守护大塘大坝。
    修好了塘坝，扩大了灌溉面积，虽然团山区今年也和去年一样旱了四十天左右，但是全区赢得了丰收。去年团山区每亩稻田平均产稻一百二十斤，今年每亩平均产稻三百五十斤，增产将近两倍。总计今年全区比去年增产稻谷一千三百万斤以上。
