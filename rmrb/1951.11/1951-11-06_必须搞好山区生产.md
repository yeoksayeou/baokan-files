We Must Do a Good Job in Mountainous Area Production
Secretary-General of the Shanxi Provincial Financial and Economic Committee Du Renzhi

The mountainous areas of North China, such as the Taihang Mountains, Wutai Mountains, Lüliang Mountains, and Taiyue Mountains, are all old liberated areas. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the people of these mountainous areas made brilliant contributions during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation.

However, production is still backward and people's lives are still hard in the remote areas of these mountains. In years of good harvest, ordinary farmers can generally eat their fill, but in the event of a poor harvest, they still have to live on bran and vegetables. Some mountainous areas (such as some places in northeastern and northwestern Shanxi) lack clothing and bedding, with two or three people sharing one quilt and one pair of pants (whoever goes out wears them). In addition, mountainous areas lack medicine, schools, and teachers.

The reasons why the people in remote mountainous areas have difficult lives are as follows: (1) There is less arable land, and the soil quality is poor. Each person has an average of only two mu of arable land; some arable land yields only two dou per mu. The mountain slopes that can be reclaimed have already been reclaimed; slopes above 35 degrees should not and cannot be reclaimed any further. It is difficult for local farmers to maintain their lives solely from land income. (2) There is a shortage of draught animals. Due to the killing, looting, and destruction by the Japanese invaders during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the loss of livestock in mountainous areas was great. In recent years, although the number of livestock in mountainous areas has increased, the rate has been slow. In particularly impoverished areas, such as Niangzicheng Village in the Second District of Fanshi, Shanxi, there were more than 100 mules and donkeys before the War of Resistance Against Japan, but now there are only three or five. In more than half of the 25 villages in the district, people use manpower to cultivate the land due to the lack of draught animals. (3) There is a lack of fertilizer. Due to the decrease in livestock (such as Niangzicheng Village having about 800 sheep in six flocks before the War of Resistance Against Japan, but now only a few), it is impossible to accumulate fertilizer, so it is difficult to quickly improve agricultural production. (4) Transportation is inconvenient. The mountainous areas are vast, and transportation is difficult, making it difficult to export surplus agricultural and sideline products and import industrial products. Also, due to transportation difficulties and poor sales, sideline production cannot be developed.

The living conditions of farmers in the mountainous areas of North China have improved compared to before the War of Resistance Against Japan. This is the result of implementing land reform and developing production policies. However, due to the limitations of natural conditions, the progress of improvement is slower than in other regions. However, no matter from a political or economic point of view, we must do a good job in mountainous area production.

According to Comrade Bo Yibo's report at the North China District County Mayor Conference, the development of production in mountainous areas should implement the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline industries, and truly establish the long-term production and construction policy of "relying on the mountains for food and nurturing the mountains." I believe that in terms of specific measures, the following points should be noted:

(1) Increase the yield per unit area of agriculture: From a long-term perspective, we can no longer reclaim wasteland, and we must start with increasing the yield per unit area. The central issue of agricultural production in mountainous areas is to turn slopes into terraces and conserve water and soil. One of the reasons why Li Shunda was able to increase production was that he was able to turn mountain gullies and slopes into terraces. To this end, in mountainous areas, we should strive to turn slopes below 35 degrees into terraces in stages and phases, and build dikes to prevent floods and store water. At the same time, we should promote improved varieties, improve cultivation techniques, and process and apply more fertilizer skillfully. We must plant according to the soil and be good at planning: (1) In mountainous areas with insufficient food, we should plant more high-yield crops, such as rye (yield is more than twice that of wheat), corn (yield is more than four times that of wheat), sweet potatoes, potatoes, and pumpkins, to solve the local people's food problems; (2) In mountainous areas where food is sufficient or surplus, we can appropriately plant cash crops, such as hemp, tobacco, medicinal materials (Codonopsis pilosula, etc.), and cotton (for local clothing), to increase people's income and overcome difficulties; (3) In mountain valleys and sandy land, plant more peanuts (yield value is more than twice that of planting grain); (4) In mountainous alkaline land, plant more sunflowers (yield value is more than three times that of planting grain); (5) In northwestern and northeastern Shanxi, western Hebei, and Chahar and Suiyuan, it is suitable to plant kenaf (one mu of millet can yield 200 jin of millet, but planting kenaf can yield 700 jin of millet); (6) In barren land, each mu of grain only yields one dou, but planting flax (linseed), the seeds can be pressed for oil, and the stalks can be peeled for flax, which can yield six or seventy jin of millet; (7) Use all available gaps to plant more castor beans (each jin of seeds is worth two and a half jin of millet); (8) Some mountainous areas can plant soybeans or broad beans, with abundant harvests. The cropping system should be studied in detail. It is best to implement crop rotation to rest the soil and increase yields.

(2) Vigorously afforest and plant trees: The difficult lives of people in remote mountainous areas are mostly caused by the destruction of mountains and forests. "Eating from the mountains requires nurturing the mountains," so in the future, we must vigorously close mountains for afforestation, strictly prohibit burning mountains for wasteland reclamation, strictly prohibit indiscriminate logging, and protect forests; and carry out large-scale afforestation in a planned and step-by-step manner. When starting, we should start with closing mountains for afforestation; and in conjunction with closing mountains for afforestation, plant a large number of production trees: (1) In areas with convenient transportation, we can plant more fresh fruit trees, such as pears, peaches, and apples. For example, a household lacking labor in Lucheng, Shanxi, planted fruit trees on two mu of land five years ago, and its income now exceeds four times the grain production, and future income can be further increased; alfalfa can be planted under fruit trees as feed. (2) In mountainous areas with difficult transportation, we can plant dried fruits and mountain products, such as walnuts, dates, apricots, persimmons, mountain peaches, and Chinese prickly ash (each jin can be exchanged for 18 jin of millet). Due to the improvement of the economic life of the people across the country and the development of foreign trade, the current output of fresh fruits, dried fruits, and mountain products is insufficient, and there is great potential for future development. All barren mountains, especially slopes around 35 degrees, can be planted with a large number of production trees. Afforestation and tree planting should form a mass movement; mutual aid teams can be the vanguard. The issue lies in guidance and promotion.

(3) Develop animal husbandry: The income of people in remote mountainous areas has always relied heavily on animal husbandry. Developing animal husbandry and breeding livestock has now become a central link in solving the production problems of remote mountainous areas. In order to increase fertilizer, improve agricultural production, and directly supply national needs, we should breed a large number of cattle and sheep; and we can reward the breeding of large livestock, such as mules and horses. In order to develop animal husbandry, we should plant amorpha fruticosa, lespedeza (commonly known as "keng tiao"), and alfalfa on barren mountains to supply forage. The vast and fertile mountainous areas of northwestern and northeastern Shanxi, western Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan can all develop animal husbandry on a large scale. In developing animal husbandry, we should pay attention to overcoming the habit of natural mating and the phenomenon of breed degradation, promote improved breeds, organize superior mating, and establish veterinary stations to prevent and control livestock diseases.

(4) Develop sideline industries in many ways: The natural conditions in mountainous areas are complex. As long as we use our brains and conduct on-the-spot observation and research, we can find many production avenues to achieve the goal of "relying on the mountains for food." In general, there are the following types: raising bees for honey, raising silkworms for silk production; collecting mountain products, digging medicinal materials; some areas can raise pigs; some places can raise rabbits on a large scale; areas with relatively convenient transportation can raise chickens on a large scale, especially the Leghorn breed, which produces the most eggs, can be promoted; combining forestry and pruning thinning, we can develop woven products and charcoal burning. In addition, hides, pig bristles, and pig and sheep casings are also major products of mountainous areas; many mountainous areas are very rich in mineral resources, and we can organize mining in a planned manner. As long as mountainous areas develop one or two sideline industries according to local conditions, they can increase their income significantly.

(5) Hunting to eliminate pests: In many mountainous areas, animal pests are very serious. Wild boars, badgers, rodents, and jackals cause great harm. Therefore, we must organize the masses to hunt them, which can protect production and livestock, and increase income.

(6) Implement agricultural product processing and improve transportation conditions. For agricultural and sideline products and local mountain products in many remote mountainous areas with closed transportation, if reasonable prices are maintained at the place of origin, the cost of transporting them out is too high, and they cannot be sold; if they are purchased at low prices at the place of origin, the people suffer too much. Therefore, to develop production in mountainous areas, we must first pay attention to two things: one is on-site processing of agricultural products; the other is improving transportation. In mountainous areas where agricultural and sideline products cannot be transported out, we can organize the processing of agricultural products. For example, grain can be used to make wine; oil crops can be pressed for oil; hemp can be used to make sacks and ropes; fat pigs can be made into salted meat and ham; in order to promote chicken raising, egg-breaking factories can be added at appropriate locations; areas producing sorghum, mung beans, potatoes, and sweet potatoes can establish flour mills; and areas producing naked oats can set up grinding mills. Agricultural product processing can develop sideline industries, increase fertilizer, reduce transportation costs, and open up product sales channels. Local leading organs should plan and organize what should be processed and where it should be processed based on specific circumstances, and avoid blind production. Improving transportation is a decisive key to developing production in mountainous areas. In order to implement the policy of developing production in mountainous areas, it is necessary to improve transportation conditions in mountainous areas in a planned manner. It is necessary to build a number of highways and main roads in selected suitable areas. In order to solve the transportation problem immediately, we should use the winter slack season to use forms such as cart pulling, animal carrying, human pushing, and human carrying, and appropriately develop transportation cooperatives to link human and animal power transportation with highway and railway transportation to form a transportation network.

Developing production in mountainous areas is of great political and economic significance. Relevant agencies should understand the specific conditions of the mountainous areas under their jurisdiction and the natural conditions, organize experts to conduct detailed research, and plan jointly with the local people, implement specific implementation plans according to local conditions, distinguish between priorities, and gradually realize them. In order to guide cadres and mobilize the broad masses to develop production in mountainous areas, we should first select typical areas, conduct key experiments, gain experience, and guide and promote the general.

    必须搞好山区生产
    山西省财经委员会秘书长  杜任之
    华北区的太行山、五台山、吕梁山、太岳山等山区，都是老解放区。这些山区的人民，在共产党与人民政府领导下，在抗日战争和解放战争中，都曾有过光辉的贡献。
    这些山区的偏僻地区，生产仍然落后，人民生活依然很苦。丰收之年，一般农民可以吃饱，如遇歉收，还须以糠菜度日。有些山区（如晋东北，晋西北某些地方）人民缺乏衣被，有两、三个人共一条被子和一条裤子的（谁出外谁穿）。此外，山区还缺乏医药，缺乏学校和师资。
    偏僻山区人民生活之所以困难，有如下几个原因：（一）耕地较少，土质也差。每人平均只有二亩上下耕地；有的耕地，每亩产量不过二斗。能开垦的山坡已经开垦了；三十五度以上的坡地，不能再开垦，也不应再开垦了。当地农民单靠土地收入，难以维持生活。（二）畜力较缺。由于抗日战争时日寇杀抢破坏，山区牲畜损失很大。近数年来，山地牲畜虽有增加，但速度不快。特别贫苦的地区，如山西繁峙二区娘子城村，抗日战争前有骡驴一百多头，现在仅有三、五头；该区二十五个村庄，大半都因畜力缺乏，而用人力耕地。（三）缺乏肥料。由于牲畜减少（如娘子城村抗日战争前有六群羊约八百只，现仅有几只），无法积肥，因此，农业生产难以很快提高。（四）交通不便。山区辽阔，交通运输困难，剩余农副产品不易输出，工业品不易输入。也因交通困难，销路不畅，副业生产无法开展。
    华北山区农民的生活情况，比较抗日战争前已有改善，这是实现了土地改革和发展生产政策的结果。但因自然条件的限制，其改善的进度比较其他地区为慢。但是，不管从政治意义上说，不管从经济意义上说，都必须搞好山区生产。
    根据薄一波同志在华北区县长会议上的报告，发展山区生产，应该是贯彻全面发展农林牧畜事业，真正树立“靠山吃山，吃山养山”的长期生产建设的方针。我认为在具体措施上，应该注意以下几点：
    （一）提高农业单位面积产量：从长期打算，不能再行开荒，必须从提高单位面积产量着手。山地农业生产的中心问题，在于把坡地变成梯田，保养水土。李顺达之所以能提高产量，原因之一就是能够把山沟坡地变成梯田。为此，在山区，要争取把三十五度以下的坡地，分段分期变为梯田，并须修筑堤坝，防洪蓄水。同时应该推广优良品种；提高耕作技术；多加工多施肥，巧加工，巧施肥。要因地下种，善于规划：（1）在粮食不足的山区，应多种植丰产作物，如黑麦（产量大于小麦一倍多）、玉茭（产量大于小麦四倍）、红薯、马铃薯、北瓜等，以解决当地群众食粮问题；（2）在粮食够吃或有余的山区，可适当种植经济作物，如麻、烟、药材（党参等）、棉花（供当地穿用），以增加群众收入，克服困难；（3）山谷沙地，多种花生（产量价值超过种谷一倍）；（4）山地碱地多种葵花（产量价值超过种谷三倍）；（5）晋西北、晋东北、冀西及察哈尔、绥远气候，宜种洋麻（一亩地种谷子可收二百斤小米，如种洋麻则可得七百斤小米）；
    （6）瘠薄之地，种谷每亩只收一斗，如种胡麻（亚麻），籽可榨油，秆可剥麻皮，则可得六七十斤小米；（7）利用一切隙地，多种蓖麻（每斤籽可值二斤半小米）；（8）某些山地可种大豆或蚕豆，收获亦丰。关于农作制度，应详加研究。最好实行轮种，以休息地力，提高产量。
    （二）大力造林植树：偏僻山区人民生活困苦，多由山林破坏造成。“吃山要养山”，故今后必须大力封山育林，严禁烧山垦荒，严禁滥伐木材，破坏森林；并有计划、有步骤地进行大规模造林。开始进行时，应从封山育林着手；并结合封山育林，大量种植生产树：（1）在交通便利地区，可多种鲜果树木，如梨、桃、苹果等。如山西潞城一个缺乏劳力户，在五年前把二亩土地种了果木树，现在收入超过产粮四倍，将来收入更可增加；果木树下可种苜蓿，作为饲料。（2）在交通困难的山区，可栽植干果山货，如核桃、枣、杏、柿子、山桃、花椒（每斤可换十八斤小米）。鲜果、干果、山货，由于全国人民经济生活的提高与对外贸易的发展，现有产量已不敷用，今后发展大有前途。凡贫瘠之山地，特别是三十五度上下的坡地，均可大量种植生产树。造林植树，应该形成群众运动；互助组可作先锋。问题在于指导和提倡。
    （三）发展畜牧：偏僻山区人民收入，向来多靠牧畜。发展牧畜与繁殖牲畜，目前已成为解决偏僻山区生产问题的一个中心环节。为了增加肥料，提高农业生产，并直接供应国家需要，应大量繁殖牛羊；并可奖励繁殖大牲畜，如骡、马等。为了发展牧畜，应在荒山种植紫穗槐、胡枝子（俗名坑条）、苜蓿，供应饲草。晋西北、晋东北、冀西、察哈尔、绥远山区地阔草肥，均可大量发展牧畜。在发展畜牧业方面，应注意克服自然交配习惯与品种退化现象，提倡改良品种，组织优种交配；并须设立兽医站，防治畜疫。
    （四）多方发展副业：山区自然情况是复杂的，只要开动脑筋，实地观察研究，可以找到许多生产门路，达到“靠山吃山”的目的。一般看来，有以下几种：养蜂收蜜，养蚕产丝；采山货，刨药材；有些地区可以养猪；有些地方可以大量养兔；交通较便利地区可大量养鸡，特别可以推广产蛋最多的莱克亨鸡种；结合育林修枝间伐，可以发展编织物与烧木炭。此外，皮毛、猪鬃、猪、羊肠衣，也是山地大宗出品；有许多山地矿产甚为丰富，可以有计划地组织采掘。山区只要因地制宜，发展一、两种副业，即能增加很大收入。
    （五）打猎除害：许多山区兽害甚为严重。野猪、獾类、鼠类、豺狼，为害甚大。因此必须组织群众捕打，既能保护生产和人畜，又能增加收入。
    （六）实行农产加工，并改善交通情况。许多交通闭塞山区的农副产品和山货土产，如在产地保持合理价格，运出来成本太大，销售不了；如廉价在产地收购，群众吃亏又太大。因此，发展山区生产，首先必须注意两件事情：一为农业生产品就地加工；一为改善交通运输。凡农副产品运不出来的山区，可以组织农产品加工。如粮食可以制酒；油料作物可以榨油；麻可以制麻袋、麻绳；肥猪可以制咸肉、火腿；为了提倡养鸡，可选择适当地点，增设打蛋厂；产高粱、绿豆、马铃薯、红薯的地区，可建立制粉厂；产莜麦地区，可设磨粉厂。农产品加工可以发展副业，增加肥料，降低运输成本，打开产品销路。当地领导机关对于什么应该加工，在什么地方加工，都应根据具体情况，加以计划和组织。避免盲目生产的现象。改善交通运输，是发展山区生产的决定关键。为了贯彻发展山区生产的方针，必须有计划地改善山区交通运输条件。选择适当地区，修筑若干公路和大路，是很必要的。为了立即解决运输问题，应该利用冬闲时间，运用车拉、畜驮、人推、人担等形式，并可适当地发展运输合作社，使人畜力运输与公路铁路运输联结起来，形成运输网。
    发展山区生产，在政治上和经济上的意义都是很大的。有关机关应该了解所属山区的具体情况，与自然条件，组织专家详加研究，与当地群众共同筹划，因地制宜，定出具体实施计划，分别轻重缓急，逐步实现。为了指导干部与动员广大群众发展山区生产，应先选择典型地区，进行重点试验，取得经验，指导并推动一般。
