We Must Do a Good Job in Mountainous Area Production
Secretary-General of the Shanxi Provincial Financial and Economic Committee Du Renzhi

The mountainous areas of North China, such as the Taihang Mountains, Wutai Mountains, LÃ¼liang Mountains, and Taiyue Mountains, are all old liberated areas. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the people of these mountainous areas made brilliant contributions during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation.

However, production is still backward and people's lives are still hard in the remote areas of these mountains. In years of good harvest, ordinary farmers can generally eat their fill, but in the event of a poor harvest, they still have to live on bran and vegetables. Some mountainous areas (such as some places in northeastern and northwestern Shanxi) lack clothing and bedding, with two or three people sharing one quilt and one pair of pants (whoever goes out wears them). In addition, mountainous areas lack medicine, schools, and teachers.

The reasons why the people in remote mountainous areas have difficult lives are as follows: (1) There is less arable land, and the soil quality is poor. Each person has an average of only two mu of arable land; some arable land yields only two dou per mu. The mountain slopes that can be reclaimed have already been reclaimed; slopes above 35 degrees should not and cannot be reclaimed any further. It is difficult for local farmers to maintain their lives solely from land income. (2) There is a shortage of draught animals. Due to the killing, looting, and destruction by the Japanese invaders during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the loss of livestock in mountainous areas was great. In recent years, although the number of livestock in mountainous areas has increased, the rate has been slow. In particularly impoverished areas, such as Niangzicheng Village in the Second District of Fanshi, Shanxi, there were more than 100 mules and donkeys before the War of Resistance Against Japan, but now there are only three or five. In more than half of the 25 villages in the district, people use manpower to cultivate the land due to the lack of draught animals. (3) There is a lack of fertilizer. Due to the decrease in livestock (such as Niangzicheng Village having about 800 sheep in six flocks before the War of Resistance Against Japan, but now only a few), it is impossible to accumulate fertilizer, so it is difficult to quickly improve agricultural production. (4) Transportation is inconvenient. The mountainous areas are vast, and transportation is difficult, making it difficult to export surplus agricultural and sideline products and import industrial products. Also, due to transportation difficulties and poor sales, sideline production cannot be developed.

The living conditions of farmers in the mountainous areas of North China have improved compared to before the War of Resistance Against Japan. This is the result of implementing land reform and developing production policies. However, due to the limitations of natural conditions, the progress of improvement is slower than in other regions. However, no matter from a political or economic point of view, we must do a good job in mountainous area production.

According to Comrade Bo Yibo's report at the North China District County Mayor Conference, the development of production in mountainous areas should implement the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline industries, and truly establish the long-term production and construction policy of "relying on the mountains for food and nurturing the mountains." I believe that in terms of specific measures, the following points should be noted:

(1) Increase the yield per unit area of agriculture: From a long-term perspective, we can no longer reclaim wasteland, and we must start with increasing the yield per unit area. The central issue of agricultural production in mountainous areas is to turn slopes into terraces and conserve water and soil. One of the reasons why Li Shunda was able to increase production was that he was able to turn mountain gullies and slopes into terraces. To this end, in mountainous areas, we should strive to turn slopes below 35 degrees into terraces in stages and phases, and build dikes to prevent floods and store water. At the same time, we should promote improved varieties, improve cultivation techniques, and process and apply more fertilizer skillfully. We must plant according to the soil and be good at planning: (1) In mountainous areas with insufficient food, we should plant more high-yield crops, such as rye (yield is more than twice that of wheat), corn (yield is more than four times that of wheat), sweet potatoes, potatoes, and pumpkins, to solve the local people's food problems; (2) In mountainous areas where food is sufficient or surplus, we can appropriately plant cash crops, such as hemp, tobacco, medicinal materials (Codonopsis pilosula, etc.), and cotton (for local clothing), to increase people's income and overcome difficulties; (3) In mountain valleys and sandy land, plant more peanuts (yield value is more than twice that of planting grain); (4) In mountainous alkaline land, plant more sunflowers (yield value is more than three times that of planting grain); (5) In northwestern and northeastern Shanxi, western Hebei, and Chahar and Suiyuan, it is suitable to plant kenaf (one mu of millet can yield 200 jin of millet, but planting kenaf can yield 700 jin of millet); (6) In barren land, each mu of grain only yields one dou, but planting flax (linseed), the seeds can be pressed for oil, and the stalks can be peeled for flax, which can yield six or seventy jin of millet; (7) Use all available gaps to plant more castor beans (each jin of seeds is worth two and a half jin of millet); (8) Some mountainous areas can plant soybeans or broad beans, with abundant harvests. The cropping system should be studied in detail. It is best to implement crop rotation to rest the soil and increase yields.

(2) Vigorously afforest and plant trees: The difficult lives of people in remote mountainous areas are mostly caused by the destruction of mountains and forests. "Eating from the mountains requires nurturing the mountains," so in the future, we must vigorously close mountains for afforestation, strictly prohibit burning mountains for wasteland reclamation, strictly prohibit indiscriminate logging, and protect forests; and carry out large-scale afforestation in a planned and step-by-step manner. When starting, we should start with closing mountains for afforestation; and in conjunction with closing mountains for afforestation, plant a large number of production trees: (1) In areas with convenient transportation, we can plant more fresh fruit trees, such as pears, peaches, and apples. For example, a household lacking labor in Lucheng, Shanxi, planted fruit trees on two mu of land five years ago, and its income now exceeds four times the grain production, and future income can be further increased; alfalfa can be planted under fruit trees as feed. (2) In mountainous areas with difficult transportation, we can plant dried fruits and mountain products, such as walnuts, dates, apricots, persimmons, mountain peaches, and Chinese prickly ash (each jin can be exchanged for 18 jin of millet). Due to the improvement of the economic life of the people across the country and the development of foreign trade, the current output of fresh fruits, dried fruits, and mountain products is insufficient, and there is great potential for future development. All barren mountains, especially slopes around 35 degrees, can be planted with a large number of production trees. Afforestation and tree planting should form a mass movement; mutual aid teams can be the vanguard. The issue lies in guidance and promotion.

(3) Develop animal husbandry: The income of people in remote mountainous areas has always relied heavily on animal husbandry. Developing animal husbandry and breeding livestock has now become a central link in solving the production problems of remote mountainous areas. In order to increase fertilizer, improve agricultural production, and directly supply national needs, we should breed a large number of cattle and sheep; and we can reward the breeding of large livestock, such as mules and horses. In order to develop animal husbandry, we should plant amorpha fruticosa, lespedeza (commonly known as "keng tiao"), and alfalfa on barren mountains to supply forage. The vast and fertile mountainous areas of northwestern and northeastern Shanxi, western Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan can all develop animal husbandry on a large scale. In developing animal husbandry, we should pay attention to overcoming the habit of natural mating and the phenomenon of breed degradation, promote improved breeds, organize superior mating, and establish veterinary stations to prevent and control livestock diseases.

(4) Develop sideline industries in many ways: The natural conditions in mountainous areas are complex. As long as we use our brains and conduct on-the-spot observation and research, we can find many production avenues to achieve the goal of "relying on the mountains for food." In general, there are the following types: raising bees for honey, raising silkworms for silk production; collecting mountain products, digging medicinal materials; some areas can raise pigs; some places can raise rabbits on a large scale; areas with relatively convenient transportation can raise chickens on a large scale, especially the Leghorn breed, which produces the most eggs, can be promoted; combining forestry and pruning thinning, we can develop woven products and charcoal burning. In addition, hides, pig bristles, and pig and sheep casings are also major products of mountainous areas; many mountainous areas are very rich in mineral resources, and we can organize mining in a planned manner. As long as mountainous areas develop one or two sideline industries according to local conditions, they can increase their income significantly.

(5) Hunting to eliminate pests: In many mountainous areas, animal pests are very serious. Wild boars, badgers, rodents, and jackals cause great harm. Therefore, we must organize the masses to hunt them, which can protect production and livestock, and increase income.

(6) Implement agricultural product processing and improve transportation conditions. For agricultural and sideline products and local mountain products in many remote mountainous areas with closed transportation, if reasonable prices are maintained at the place of origin, the cost of transporting them out is too high, and they cannot be sold; if they are purchased at low prices at the place of origin, the people suffer too much. Therefore, to develop production in mountainous areas, we must first pay attention to two things: one is on-site processing of agricultural products; the other is improving transportation. In mountainous areas where agricultural and sideline products cannot be transported out, we can organize the processing of agricultural products. For example, grain can be used to make wine; oil crops can be pressed for oil; hemp can be used to make sacks and ropes; fat pigs can be made into salted meat and ham; in order to promote chicken raising, egg-breaking factories can be added at appropriate locations; areas producing sorghum, mung beans, potatoes, and sweet potatoes can establish flour mills; and areas producing naked oats can set up grinding mills. Agricultural product processing can develop sideline industries, increase fertilizer, reduce transportation costs, and open up product sales channels. Local leading organs should plan and organize what should be processed and where it should be processed based on specific circumstances, and avoid blind production. Improving transportation is a decisive key to developing production in mountainous areas. In order to implement the policy of developing production in mountainous areas, it is necessary to improve transportation conditions in mountainous areas in a planned manner. It is necessary to build a number of highways and main roads in selected suitable areas. In order to solve the transportation problem immediately, we should use the winter slack season to use forms such as cart pulling, animal carrying, human pushing, and human carrying, and appropriately develop transportation cooperatives to link human and animal power transportation with highway and railway transportation to form a transportation network.

Developing production in mountainous areas is of great political and economic significance. Relevant agencies should understand the specific conditions of the mountainous areas under their jurisdiction and the natural conditions, organize experts to conduct detailed research, and plan jointly with the local people, implement specific implementation plans according to local conditions, distinguish between priorities, and gradually realize them. In order to guide cadres and mobilize the broad masses to develop production in mountainous areas, we should first select typical areas, conduct key experiments, gain experience, and guide and promote the general.
