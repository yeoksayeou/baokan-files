Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 22nd: At the Korean Armistice Negotiation Subcommittee meeting on November 22nd, the U.S. side, in addition to proposing some textual revisions to our side's November 21st proposal, still insisted that if the armistice agreement is not signed within 30 days after an agreement is reached on the second agenda item, then the current line of contact between the two sides should be determined as the military demarcation line, and the purpose and duration of its effectiveness should be jointly decided by both sides at that time. Our representative reiterated that the second agenda item must be resolved in one go during the discussion of the second agenda item, and that the conditions related to the second agenda item should not be decided again 30 days after an agreement has already been reached on the second agenda item. Therefore, our side maintains that if the armistice agreement is not signed within 30 days after an agreement is reached on the second agenda item, the two subcommittee groups should, after all agenda items have been agreed upon, revise the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone according to the changes in the actual line of contact between the two sides, so that the revised military demarcation line is completely consistent with the actual line of contact between the two sides before the signing of the armistice agreement, as the military demarcation line during the military armistice period. The U.S. representative agreed to consider our opinion and suggested that the subcommittee continue to meet at 11:00 a.m. on November 23rd, and that the staff of both sides begin preliminary work on calibrating the existing contact line at the same time.

    在二十二日朝鲜停战谈判小组委员会上
    我重申第二项议程必须在讨论时一次解决 【新华社开城二十二日电】二十二日的朝鲜停战谈判小组委员会上，美方代表对于我方十一月二十一日的提案除提出若干文字上的修正外，仍然主张如在第二项议程达成协议后的三十日内停战协议尚未签字，则确定当时的双方接触线为军事分界线，其生效的目的与期限留待双方届时共同协议决定。我方代表再度指出：第二项议程必须在讨论第二项议程时一次解决，而不应该在第二项议程已经达成协议的三十天后再行决定有关第二项议程的条件。因此我方主张：如果第二项议程达成协议后的三十日内停战协议尚未签字，则双方小组委员会应在全部议程达成协议后按照双方实际接触线所发生的变化修正军事分界线与非军事区，使修正后的军事分界线与停战协议签字前的双方实际接触线完全一致，作为军事停战期间的军事分界线。美方代表同意考虑我方意见后，建议小组会在十一月二十三日上午十一时继续举行，并同时由双方参谋人员开始进行校正现有接触线的初步工作。
