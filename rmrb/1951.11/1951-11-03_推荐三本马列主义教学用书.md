Recommendation of Three Marxist-Leninist Teaching Materials

Editor: The "Basic Course Plan of Marxism-Leninism," "Teaching Outline of Political Economy," and "Teaching Outline of Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism" published by the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Northeast People's Government in May and June this year (distributed by Xinhua Bookstore Northeast Branch) are, in my opinion, three books worth recommending.

These three books are all documents approved and promulgated by the Social Science Education Department of the Soviet Higher Education Ministry. Although the term "teaching outline" is a familiar one to comrades who have studied Soviet education, this is probably the first time that the teaching outline of higher education institutions approved by the Soviet Higher Education Ministry has been formally introduced to China.

In Marxist-Leninist teaching in our country's universities and colleges, there are currently no clear and unified regulations on how to allocate the lecturing and discussion time for the "Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism," "Political Economy," and "Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism" courses, which are part of the Marxist-Leninist curriculum, and what reference documents should be read. Therefore, it is difficult to guarantee a certain teaching quality and a certain teaching effect. These books can help us appropriately solve a series of problems.

I hope that these books can serve as a reference for formulating our own teaching outlines for relevant subjects in universities and colleges. In addition, these books are also good reference materials for the theoretical study of cadres in service.

### 推荐三本马列主义教学用书

    推荐三本马列主义教学用书
    编辑同志：东北人民政府文化教育委员会在今年五、六月出版的“马列主义基础课程计划”、“政治经济学教学大纲”、“辩证唯物论与历史唯物论教学大纲”（新华书店东北总分店发行），我觉得是值得推荐的三本书。
    这三本书，都是经过苏联高等教育部社会科学教育司批准公布的文件。“教学大纲”虽然已是学习过苏联教育的同志们所熟悉的名词，但苏联高等教育部批准的高等学校教学大纲，正式被介绍到中国来，恐怕这还是第一次。
    在我国高等学校马克思列宁主义教学中，作为马克思列宁主义课程的“马列主义基础”、“政治经济学”以及“辩证唯物论和历史唯物论”的讲授和讨论时间如何分配，应该阅读那些参考文件，目前还缺乏明确的统一的规定，因此，也就难于保证一定的教学质量和一定的教学效果。这几本书，是可以帮助我们适当地解决一系列问题的。
    我希望这几本书能够作为制订我们自己的高等学校有关科目教学大纲的参考。另外，对于在职干部的理论学习，这几本书也不失为很好的参考读物。
