	One Mountain Ridge, One Fortress
	—Remembering a Corner of the Battle of Maliang Mountain
	During Van Fleet's autumn offensive in October, the 29th Brigade of the British Commonwealth Division suffered its third heavy blow on the Maliang Mountain position on the right bank of the Imjin River.
	On the morning of October 5th, enemy artillery fire poured down on the 216.8-meter high ground, which was close to the main peak of Maliang Mountain, like a rainstorm. Three hours later, the enemy believed that all living things on the mountain had been destroyed. More than three hundred infantrymen began to charge, quickly occupying the forward position on the right front of the high ground, and immediately surrounded the main position. At this time, the volunteer soldiers, with tiger-like eyes, were entrenched in the main position, waiting for an opportunity to counterattack.
	There were thirteen people in the bunker on the main position. They were only twenty meters away from the enemy, and enemy incendiary grenades were constantly hitting the entrance of the bunker. The soldiers could not contain their anger, and some asked the commander: "Charge! Charge!"
	Yan Zhigang, the deputy company commander who commanded the battle, restrained everyone and said: "It's not time yet. The current task is to use firepower to kill and wound a group of enemies on the mountain!" He then issued an order: "The light machine gun fires sideways at the enemy in front, the fifth squad attacks the enemy's flank, and the 60mm gun fires continuously at the enemy group!" Immediately, the fire net cast by the warriors covered the enemy. The enemy charged four times but was still blocked twenty meters away.
	During the fierce battle, the battalion headquarters sent an order: "There are fraternal troops on the flanks. Your company must hold the position and counterattack the enemy. You can have reinforcements if you want reinforcements, and ammunition if you want ammunition." At this time, some of the fraternal troops had already counterattacked the enemy.
	"The time has come, counterattack!" As soon as Deputy Company Commander Yan gave the order, Fifth Squad Leader Chen Zhongxing led the entire squad to quickly rush up the mountain from the left side while throwing grenades. More than two hundred British soldiers rolled down the mountain like potatoes poured out of a pocket. They couldn't bother to pull the corpses, and they didn't want their machine guns. Many military caps were caught on branches. At this time, the warriors used firepower to pursue them.
	The mountain top was recaptured. We only sacrificed one person and wounded two. The enemy paid the price of nearly two hundred casualties.
	On the morning of the 6th, the enemy, as usual, bombarded our position for three hours. As soon as the artillery fire stopped, they launched an offensive. The force increased to more than seven hundred people, twice as many as yesterday. The enemy vainly attempted to take the main position in one fell swoop. Deputy Company Commander Yan had anticipated this situation the night before. That night, the entire company strengthened the fortifications, increased the troops on the front line, and strengthened the deployment of a light machine gun. Deputy Company Commander Yan called on the entire company: "Tomorrow, we must not let the enemy in. We must wipe out the enemy on the front line of the position!"
	On the position, acting deputy platoon leader Pan Shan led a squad to guard the right side, clerk Zhang Hao and the soldiers were responsible for the front, and Chen Zhongxing, who had just been promoted to acting deputy platoon leader, led the soldiers to defend the left side. This is what the commanders and fighters later praised as the "three iron walls."
	The enemy first charged the right side four times, but was suppressed by the firepower of Pan Shan's submachine gun and Yang Yun's light machine gun. Later, the enemy concentrated more troops to surround them. Pan Shan, Yang Yun, and others cleverly withdrew temporarily and approached the main position. But as soon as the enemy rushed to the top of the mountain, Pan Shan led the soldiers to counterattack, repeating this "seesaw" battle three times. On the fourth time, another mobile squad of ours also joined the counterattack, and Zhang Hao, Chen Zhongxing, and others actively supported them with firepower at the same time. Pan Shan and the warriors finally recaptured the position. Just as Pan Shan rushed to the top of the mountain, this outstanding Communist Party member was unfortunately hit by enemy machine gun bullets and sacrificed.
	The enemy could not attack on the right, so they turned to the left. The enemy rushed to within twenty meters of our position without any movement. Thinking that there was a gap here, they threw a few incendiary grenades at the mountain top and straightened up to rush up the mountain. In fact, Chen Zhongxing had been monitoring the enemy on the left side of the position. As soon as the incendiary bomb exploded, Chen Zhongxing shouted: "Fire!" The submachine gun immediately rang out. Just as the enemy was about to lie down, Chen Zhongxing threw a grenade, which killed thirteen enemies. The enemy charged three times and was bounced back by this iron wall in the same way.
	Having hit the wall twice, the enemy was still unwilling to give up and attacked our front position. At this time, the entire company, regardless of combat personnel or support personnel, joined the battle and launched a competition to kill the enemy. Clerk Zhang Hao put two submachine guns beside him and concentrated the grenades in front of his fortification. He said to the deputy company commander: "As long as there are people and ammunition, we will take care of the enemies in front!" The cultural instructor, the communication soldier, and the bugler all assured the soldiers that they would deliver ammunition continuously. They filled all the submachine gun magazines with bullets and placed grenades with the lids opened in front of the soldiers. The soldiers rubbed their fists and said: "Come on, you devils! The more the better. We have plenty of iron rations. You will never be hungry for the rest of your life!"
	This time the enemy adopted a wave-like echelon formation to launch a series of offensives. Zhang Hao encouraged everyone: "No matter how many enemies come, stay calm and see where the submachine gun sweeps, and throw grenades there!" The enemy's offensive lasted for two hours, and the warriors also fought continuously for two hours with an ample supply of ammunition. At that time, the grenades on the front line of the position were used up, and boxes of grenades were immediately sent up; before the bullets of one submachine gun were finished, another submachine gun filled with bullets was already prepared. As for the enemy, those who rushed to the front shrank back, and those who were behind were driven up by the officers like sheep. Those who were driven up from behind collided with those who were fleeing from the front, and were thrown into a mess and suffered even more casualties from our army's firepower. The enemy's five offensives were all repelled.
	At dusk, the enemy's artillery fired again. The soldiers called it the "mourning cannon." This time the artillery fire was not to cover the offensive, but to cover the removal of corpses. On this day, the enemy left more than five hundred corpses behind, while the Maliang Mountain position still stood firm. (Xinhua News Agency)

    一座山岭一个堡垒
    ——记马良山阻击战一角
    十月间在范佛里特的秋季攻势中，英军联邦师二十九旅在临津江右岸马良山阵地遭受了第三次沉重的打击。
    十月五日晨，敌人的炮火像暴雨一样向紧靠着马良山主峰的二一六点八高地倾泻下来。三个钟头以后，敌人以为山上的一切有生物全被毁灭了。三百多个步兵就开始冲锋，很快地占领了高地右前方的前沿阵地，并立即向主阵地实行包围。这时，志愿军战士们虎视眈眈地雄踞在主阵地上伺机反击。
    在主阵地的掩蔽部里的有十三个人。他们离敌人只有二十公尺，敌人的燃烧手榴弹已经不断地打到掩蔽部口。战士们按捺不住胸中的怒火，有的就向指挥员要求：“冲吧！冲吧！”
    指挥这一战斗的副连长阎志刚抑止着大家说：“还不到时候，现在的任务是用火力把敌人杀伤一批在山头上！”他接着发出命令：“轻机枪侧射正面敌人，五班打敌侧翼，六零炮向敌群连发！”立刻，勇士们撒出的火网罩住了敌人。敌人冲了四次仍被阻在相距二十公尺的地方。
    激战中营部传来命令：“侧翼有兄弟部队，你连要坚守阵地，把敌人反击下去，要援兵有援兵，要弹药有弹药。”这时，兄弟部队的一部分战友们已向敌人反击了。
    “时候到了，反击！”阎副连长的命令一下，五班长陈忠兴就带领全班一面打着手雷，一面由左侧迅速扑上山头。二百多个英国兵像从口袋里猛倒出来的土豆子一样地滚下山去。死尸顾不得拉了，机枪也不要了，不少军帽被树枝挂住。这时勇士们又用火力跟踪追击。
    山头夺回来了。我们仅牺牲一人，负伤两人。敌人却付出了近二百人的伤亡代价。
    六日晨，敌人照例向我阵地炮轰三小时，炮火一停便接着冲锋了。兵力增加到七百多人，比昨天多了一倍。敌人妄想一举攻下主阵地。这个情况，阎副连长在昨天晚上就预料到了。当晚全连加修了工事，在前沿增加了兵力，并加强配备了一挺轻机枪。阎副连长号召全连：“明天不能把敌人放进来，要把敌人消灭在阵地前沿！”
    在阵地上，代理副排长潘山带领一个班守在右面，文书张豪和战士们负责正面，才提升为代理副排长的陈忠兴带着战士防守左面，这就是后来被指战员们称颂的“三面铁墙”。
    敌人先向右面冲了四次，都被潘山的冲锋枪和杨云的轻机枪的火力压了下去。后来，敌人集中了更多的兵力包围上来。潘山和杨云等就机智地暂时撤离，靠近主阵地。但当敌人刚刚冲上山头，潘山又率领战士们反击上去，这样反复“拉锯”了三次。到第四次，我们另一个机动班也投入了反击，张豪、陈忠兴等同时用火力积极支援他们。潘山与勇士们终于把阵地夺了回来。就在潘山冲上山头时，这位优秀的共产党员不幸被敌人的机枪子弹打中而牺牲了。
    敌人在右面攻不动，便转到左面去。敌人冲到我阵地前二十多公尺还不见动静，以为这里是个空隙，就向山头扔出了几个燃烧手榴弹，直起身子冲上山来。其实陈忠兴一直在左侧阵地监视着敌人，待燃烧弹一爆炸，陈忠兴就高喊一声：“打！”冲锋枪立即响了。敌人正想卧倒，陈忠兴打出一个手雷，就炸死敌人十三个。敌人冲了三次又同样被这面铁墙碰回去了。
    碰了两次壁的敌人仍死不甘心地向我正面阵地进攻。这时，全连不分战斗人员和勤杂人员都投入了战斗，发起了杀敌竞赛。文书张豪把两枝冲锋枪拿在身旁，把手榴弹集中在自己工事的前面。他向副连长说：“只要有人在，有弹药，正面的敌人我们包打！”文化教员、通讯员和司号员等都向战士们保证源源运送弹药。他们把冲锋枪梭子全压满子弹，手榴弹盖全掀开了放在战士们面前。战士们磨拳擦掌地说：“鬼子们来吧！越多越好，铁干粮有的是，叫你吃了一辈子不饿！”
    这次敌人采取波浪式的梯形队形作轮番冲锋。张豪鼓动大家说：“不管敌人来多少，沉着气，看冲锋枪往那里扫，手榴弹就往那里扔！”敌人的冲锋持续了两个钟头，勇士们在充裕的弹药的供应下也连续打了两个钟头。当时前沿阵地手榴弹打完了，后面一箱箱的手榴弹马上送上来；一枝冲锋枪的子弹还没打完，另一枝压满子弹的冲锋枪已经预备好了。而敌人呢，冲在前面的往后缩，后面的又像羊一样被军官赶上来，后面被赶上来的和前面逃命下来的撞在一起，乱成一团更遭到我军的火力杀伤。敌人的五次冲锋都被打退了。
    黄昏，敌人的炮又响了。战士们把它称做“吊丧炮”。这次的炮火不是掩护冲锋，而是来掩护拉死尸的。这一天敌人遗下的尸体就有五百多具，而马良山阵地仍屹立不动。（新华社）
