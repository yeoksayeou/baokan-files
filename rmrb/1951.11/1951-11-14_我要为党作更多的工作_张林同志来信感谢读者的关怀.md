　　I Want to Do More Work for the Party
    ——Comrade Zhang Lin Writes to Thank Readers for Their Concern
    To the Editors and Comrade Readers: Recently, comrades have often read to me articles and letters published in the People's Daily praising me, which makes me feel extremely ashamed. The difficulties I have overcome and the work I have done are too insignificant compared to the comrades who are fighting heroically against American imperialism on the Korean battlefield.
    When I was young, I didn't know a single character. The leading comrades of the Party and the Communist Youth League taught me to read, taught me to recognize friends and enemies, and taught me to recognize the path of proletarian liberation. The Party has been patiently educating and cultivating me for seventeen or eighteen years. Unfortunately, just when I was able to do a little something for the people, I was blinded by the evil enemy, preventing me from contributing more strength to the Party and the people. I have thought of many ways to do more work for the people and the Party, but the efficiency is still not high and the results are not great. In the future, under the leadership of the Party, I will expand my weak strength further and further to repay the Party and the comrades for their concern for me.

　　我要为党作更多的工作
    ——张林同志来信感谢读者的关怀
    编辑同志并转读者同志：最近同志们常念给我听人民日报上刊登的表扬我的文章和来信，使我感到万分惭愧。我所克服的困难、作的工作，若与正在朝鲜战场上和美帝国主义进行英勇斗争的同志相比，就太渺小了。
    我幼年的时候，一个字不识，党和共产主义青年团的领导同志就教我识字，教我认清朋友和敌人，教我认清了无产阶级解放的道路。党就这样谆谆善诱地教育与培养我十七、八年。可惜我刚刚能为人民作一点事情，就被万恶的敌人打瞎了眼睛，使我不能为党为人民出更多的力量。我想了很多办法，为人民为党多作些工作，但仍然效率不高、成绩不大。今后我要在党领导下，把我微弱的力量扩大再扩大，来回答党和同志们对我的关心。
