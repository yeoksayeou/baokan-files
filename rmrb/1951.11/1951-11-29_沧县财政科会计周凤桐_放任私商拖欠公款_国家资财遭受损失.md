    Cangxian County Finance Section Accountant Zhou Fengtong
    Indulges Private Merchants in Defaulting on Public Funds
    Causing Losses to State Assets
    
    Editor: Zhou Fengtong, an accountant in the Finance Section of the Cangxian County People's Government, was swayed by private merchants and allowed them to default on public funds, causing losses to state assets. In March of this year, the Cangxian County Finance Section, due to the limited space in a certain grain depot, feared that the grain would rot in the rainy season and decided to sell the grain in the depot. Zhao Yuanji, the head of the County Finance Section, assigned this task to accountant Zhou Fengtong. Zhou Fengtong transferred 24,007 catties of corn from the grain depot to the private merchant Guangda Grain Store for sale on consignment. During the period of selling the grain, he accepted the "attentive hospitality" of Zhang Shaojie, the deputy manager of the grain store (a counter-revolutionary element who has been detained), and was invited to dinner five times and to bathe twice. By April 26, all the grain had been sold. However, Guangda Grain Store still owed more than 11,378,000 yuan in grain payments. By September, Zhou Fengtong had still not recovered the payment, allowing Zhang Shaojie to use the funds for speculative activities. Zhou Fengtong never reported this matter to his superiors, and Zhao Yuanji neither pursued the payment nor inspected the work, demonstrating a bureaucratic work style. In September of this year, after the counter-revolutionary Zhang Shaojie was arrested, he confessed to the outstanding payment. When relevant departments questioned Zhou Fengtong, he was evasive and tried to conceal the truth. After an investigation by the Cangxian County People's Supervisory Committee, a request has been submitted to higher authorities to give Zhou Fengtong a punishment of dismissal with retention for observation and to give Zhao Yuanji a demerit. 　Sun Zhiyuan

    沧县财政科会计周凤桐
    放任私商拖欠公款
    国家资财遭受损失
    编辑同志：河北省沧县人民政府财政科会计周凤桐受私商拉拢，放任私商拖欠公款，使国家资财受到损失。今年三月间，沧县财政科因某处粮库房子狭窄，恐雨季到后，粮食霉烂，决定将该粮库存粮变卖。县财政科长赵元吉将此项任务交由会计周凤桐负责。周凤桐将粮库中的二万四千零七斤玉米转由私商广大粮栈代卖。在卖粮期间，他接受该粮栈副经理张少杰（反革命分子，已扣押）的“殷勤招待”，曾被请吃饭五次，洗澡二次。四月二十六日，该项粮食全部卖完。但广大粮栈仍欠粮款一千一百三十七万八千余元未缴清。至九月间，周凤桐仍未将此款催清，致使张少杰利用此款做了投机捣把的资金。对于此事，周凤桐从未向上级报告，赵元吉也未追问此款和检查此项工作，表现了官僚主义作风。今年九月，反革命分子张少杰被捕后，供出此项欠款。有关部门追问周凤桐时，他还支吾掩饰，企图隐瞒。此事经沧县人民监察委员会检查后，已呈请上级给周凤桐撤职留用处分，给赵元吉记过处分。　孙志远
