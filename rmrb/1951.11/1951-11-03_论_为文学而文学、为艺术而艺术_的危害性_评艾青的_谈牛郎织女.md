    On the Harmfulness of "Literature for Literature's Sake, Art for Art's Sake"
    ——A Critique of Ai Qing's "Talking About the Cowherd and Weaver Girl"
    Yang Shaoxuan
    Editor's Note: This newspaper published an article by Comrade Ai Qing on August 31st, "Talking About the Cowherd and Weaver Girl," pointing out that literary and art workers should correctly treat our nation's myths and legends in their creations; they should appropriately retain the spirit of the original myths and legends, and should not arbitrarily and crudely destroy the simple imagination of the ancient people. It also criticized Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's "New Heavenly River Match." Although this article has some incomplete points, its basic viewpoint is correct. After the publication of this article, this newspaper continuously received several letters from Comrade Yang Shaoxuan opposing Comrade Ai Qing's views in his article, and believing that this newspaper should not have published that article, demanding that this newspaper conduct a thorough self-criticism. He then wrote the following article. We believe that Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's basic viewpoints and attitudes are erroneous. However, this is a universal issue concerning the handling of historical themes and myths and legends in literary and artistic creation, and it is worth bringing up for public discussion. Now, this article and Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's three letters are published together below, hoping for everyone's discussion.

    I don't have much knowledge of literature and art. Although I know that "literature for literature's sake, art for art's sake" is wrong, I'm not very clear about what kind of harm it does to the people. I think most people feel the same way, wondering what's wrong with "doing it" a little. It's not easy to imagine without specific examples in front of you. Well, Mr. Ai Qing's article "Talking About the Cowherd and Weaver Girl" (original text in the People's Daily, August 31st, third edition) provides us with a vivid example, answering this question. Please study it carefully.

    I. Correct Our Viewpoints on the Literary and Artistic Movement and the Opera Reform Movement

    Our literary and artistic movement and opera reform movement are an integral part of the cultural revolution of the broad masses of people under the leadership of the proletariat. Because in the past China was still a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country, the working class and peasant masses were under the cruel oppression of the feudal fascist bureaucratic comprador class. Most of them lost the opportunity for cultural education. Generally speaking, they had no right to speak, let alone high levels of literature and art. Only with the victorious progress of the New Democratic Revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, overthrowing the feudal fascist reactionary regime, did the working class and peasant masses gain political rights. They then truly had the literary and artistic movement and the opera reform movement. Thus, land reform, resisting America and aiding Korea, were all processed into songs, novels, and even scripts and performed on the stage based on various stories. Needless to say, these works, whether in literary rhetoric or artistic form, have some very immature and crude aspects. In the eyes of feudal scholar-officials or bourgeois writers, they would feel very vulgar and ridiculous, thinking they are "unworthy of the elegant hall." The more this movement develops, the more dissatisfied they become. Our view is exactly the opposite, and we adopt the most loving and respectful attitude. We do not shy away from immaturity and crudeness, but believe that without immaturity there is no growth, and without crudeness it is difficult to imagine perfection, viewing it as a development process. Anyone who wants to uproot this so-called "immature" and "crude" people's opera and art movement, we will resolutely and firmly oppose. As for our own work, we seek progress on the basis of this so-called "immature" and "crude," which is our basic attitude towards the current literary and artistic movement and opera reform movement.

    II. What is the Result of "Myth for Myth's Sake"?

    Mr. Ai Qing's "Talking About the Cowherd and Weaver Girl" article answers this question. He loudly proclaims:

    "Using myths to allude to reality, combining the current domestic and international situation, land reform, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, resisting America and aiding Korea, defending world peace, etc. ... This tendency is developing most fiercely..."

    Mr. Ai Qing is angry and scolds this as a "barbaric act of arbitrarily slaughtering what he considers a very beautiful myth."

    Look at the "evidence of guilt" he cited from my "New Heavenly River Match," there are these four lines: "The Cowherd grazes cattle on the hillside, the Weaver Girl is skilled at weaving. Weaving a net of heaven and earth, catching the owl to gain peace." According to Ai Qing's logic, these all belong to "barbaric acts," why? Because he thinks this "owl" is "alluding" to that "Truman" in his article. In fact, Mr. Ai Qing is being paranoid. The "owl" I wrote is only generally implying destructive elements, destroying people's happy marriages, destroying production relations, that is, destroying production, being accomplices of feudalism, and naturally there may also be imperialist "Trumans" inside. Why does he so hate allusions? Ai Qing himself can say that he is protecting the so-called "beautiful myth," but on the other hand, he resolutely does not allow even a movement against the imperialist "Truman."

    Mr. Ai Qing is protecting the "beautiful myth" and opposes "slaughtering." Not allowing "using myths to allude to reality," he makes an exception and sets a rule for us, saying:

    "When rewriting, we must clarify the theme, and emphasize the three basic concepts of labor, love, and anti-feudalism."

    This seems to say that myths can be rewritten, can allude to reality, can be anti-feudal, but one thing is not allowed, that is, not allowed to "allude to anti-imperialism." The two words "owl" cannot be used. Whoever "alludes" is a "barbaric act." Mr. Ai Qing, who are you speaking for? This is the result of "myth for myth's sake."

    I think comrades all know that Chairman Mao told the story of "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." In this myth, what the Foolish Old Man wanted to move were the Taihang and Wangwu Mountains. Chairman Mao said: We want to remove these two mountains: one is the mountain of feudalism, and the other is the mountain of imperialism. Isn't this "using myth to allude to reality"? Using the Taihang and Wangwu Mountains to "allude" to feudalism and imperialism. We have all received this education and are doing it this way, and are still doing it. I have written the play "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." According to Ai Qing's logic, these are all undesirable. This would be called a "barbaric act," then what is a "civilized act"? There is an answer in his article, let's take a look.

    III. Who is Doing the "Arbitrary Slaughtering of Barbaric Acts"?

    Ai Qing scolds others for "arbitrarily slaughtering the myths he considers very beautiful," as if he is the only protector of the "original very beautiful myths." Let's see how he talks about the myth of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl, first citing the first one he talks about, he says:

    "The Weaver Girl is the seventh granddaughter of the Emperor of Heaven, weaving cloud brocade celestial garments on the east side of the Milky Way. The Cowherd grazes cattle on the west side of the river. Both are very diligent. The Emperor of Heaven loves them and allows them to marry. After marriage, the two indulge in pleasure and abandon labor. The Emperor of Heaven is angry and separates them, with the Milky Way in between. He orders the crows to tell them to meet once every seven days. The crows transmit the wrong message, saying they meet once every year on the seventh day of the seventh month."

    Is this the "original"? Absolutely not, but it has been slaughtered in Ai Qing's writing. There is no need to go far to find this original myth. It is cited in the August 20th edition of the Xinmin Evening News, fifth edition, signed by Ju Nong:

    "East of the Milky Way is the Weaver Girl, the son of the Emperor of Heaven. Year after year, the loom toils, weaving cloud brocade celestial garments. The Emperor of Heaven pities her loneliness and allows her to marry the Cowherd west of the river. After marriage, she abandons weaving. The Emperor of Heaven is angry and orders her to return to the east of the river, only allowing her to cross the river for a meeting on the night of the seventh day of the seventh month every year."

    Song Dynasty Zhang Lai's Double Seventh poem:

    "A leaf of paulownia falls in the human world, the god of autumn travels and returns to the Big Dipper. The divine officials summon the spirit magpies, directly crossing the Milky Way with clouds as bridges. The beauty east of the river is the daughter of the Emperor of Heaven, year after year her jade fingers toil at the loom. Weaving clouds and mist into purple true garments, hard work without joy, her face indifferent. The Emperor pities her loneliness and allows her to marry the Cowherd west of the river. Since marriage, she has abandoned weaving, morning and evening combing her green hair and cloud-like tresses. Indulging in pleasure and not returning, the Emperor of Heaven is angry, banishing her back to the path she came from, only allowing one meeting per year, crossing the river on the seventh day of the seventh month..."

    The version of the Jingchu Chronicle of the Years may be subject to verification, but this citation is serious, and the two records are generally consistent. In Ai Qing's writing, the myth has been greatly slaughtered. Look, the Cowherd and Weaver Girl were originally two laborers, and the Emperor of Heaven was angry, so he restricted and deprived a couple of their right to marry. This Emperor of Heaven is even more powerful than the feudal lords, truly symbolizing slave owners. Although the two records are written by scholar-officials, this sinful act is still recorded on the head of the Emperor of Heaven. In Mr. Ai Qing's writing, the Emperor of Heaven's crime is transferred to the crows, that is, transferring the crimes of the reactionary rulers to others. Letting go of the enemy and blaming the people. The myth, which originally had class opposition attributes, has been blurred in class struggle by you. Why is this? Is this a "civilized act"? Therefore, the truly "arbitrary slaughtering of barbaric acts" does not belong to others, but only to Ai Qing himself. Isn't this a clear fact?

    Let's look at the second story he tells, he says:

    "The Weaver Girl is the granddaughter of the Queen Mother of the West, weaving clouds in the sky; the Cowherd is a cowherd in the human world, abused by his brother and sister-in-law. One day, the cow tells him that the Weaver Girl and other fairies are going to bathe in the Milky Way, and asks him to take a fairy garment. When the Weaver Girl is looking for clothes, he goes to return it to her, and asks her to marry him. She will definitely agree. The Cowherd does this. After the Weaver Girl marries the Cowherd, she gives birth to a son and a daughter. The Queen Mother of the West learns of this and captures the Weaver Girl back. The cow tells the Cowherd that he can put its skin on and chase to the sky. When the Cowherd carries two children and chases to the sky, the Queen Mother of the West takes off her hairpin and draws a line behind the Weaver Girl, which becomes the Milky Way, separating the couple. But they often gaze at each other across the river and weep, moving the Queen Mother of the West, so she allows them to meet once a year on the seventh day of the seventh month. When they meet, magpies build a bridge..."

    Mr. Ai Qing said he "prefers the second one," but according to Ai Qing's logic, this second one has been "slaughtered," because the original was a heavenly myth, but the second one has added half a human story, and the Emperor of Heaven has been "slaughtered" into the Queen Mother. Ai Qing can naturally say that this is not called slaughter but creation. Oh, a myth can have creation in every generation, then why is it not allowed to "use myths to allude to reality" and create in the great era of the people's revolution? As soon as someone has a little creation, he scolds them again as a "barbaric act." The thought expressed is so confused and unreasonable.

    IV. Who is "Blurring" the Meaning of the Original Myth?

    Mr. Ai Qing repeatedly says that people "kick the original myths and legends aside," "cannot find the clues of the original myths," and "completely blur the clues of the original myths." This is lying through his teeth, because any playwright who wants to use the Cowherd and Weaver Girl myth, more or less, for better or worse, although uneven, will always have "myth clues." It is impossible to have no clues at all. To say that the true meaning of the original myth is "blurred," to say "kicked aside," Ai Qing certainly did not kick it with his feet, but we have seen him use his hands to pick up a pen and brush it aside, and "blurred" the true meaning of the original myth. In the first myth, he used his hands to pick up a pen and write the crime of the Emperor of Heaven depriving the working people of their freedom of marriage on the crow's account, that is, he personally transferred the crimes of the reactionary rulers to the people's heads. This is how he truly makes it impossible for the general reader to find the clues to why this myth was created. Let's not talk about that. Let's see how he talks about the second myth, he says, "The Queen Mother of the West... allows them to meet once a year on the seventh day of the seventh month. When they meet, magpies build a bridge." How does Ai Qing explain this? He says: This "is an extremely beautiful poem of imagination." "Magpies build a bridge so that the Cowherd and Weaver Girl can meet." This is also truly blurring the meaning of the original myth, and should be said to be a distortion. Look, "meet once a year on the seventh day of the seventh month" is the Queen Mother of the West's imperial decree. The so-called magpie or bird bridge building is carried out under this imperial decree. If magpies or birds symbolize the masses, then these masses are enslaved by the Queen Mother's feudalism. Doesn't this myth clearly bear the mark of the feudal class? From this, it can be seen that what Ai Qing likes in the myth, what he appreciates as "beautiful," "extremely beautiful," etc., is full of the suffering of the people. Therefore, it is not others who truly blur the clues of the original myth, especially the meaning, but Ai Qing himself. Isn't this clear? Without a scientific analysis of a myth, only confused ideas can be produced, which is also a portrayal of "myth for myth's sake."

    V. "Completely Became Something Else"

    "Completely became something else." Mr. Ai Qing, you said it right. We dare not say "completely," but we want to become "something else." For Mr. Ai Qing, this sentence just proves that he is a typical "myth for myth's sake" theorist. If you don't want to become "something else," then you can only leave it unchanged. If you move it, it will change and become "something else." History and revolution are so ruthless. Regardless of whether you "literature for literature's sake, myth for myth's sake" writers are willing or not, it is changing with all its strength. We have rich experience. This kind of change will definitely cause dissatisfaction among feudal scholar-officials and bourgeois writers. They think it is "immature" and "crude" and unbearable to watch, even scolding it as a "barbaric act," but they have no way to stop this change. So what to do? Then there is only regret and scolding.

    Mr. Ai Qing doesn't like "becoming something else," but looking at the two Cowherd and Weaver Girl stories he cited, the second one clearly "slaughtered" the first one, and added other things, so it became the "something else" of the second one. And Mr. Ai Qing is clearly saying that he "likes the second one." This is liking "something else." Isn't this making fun of himself?

    Here, let's talk about why it inevitably becomes "something else." We want to implement the Government Administration Council's "Instructions on Opera Reform Work," to achieve "People's Opera is an important weapon to educate the broad masses of people with democratic spirit and patriotic spirit." To complete this task, we must use historical materialism and dialectical materialism to scientifically analyze and appropriately criticize old stories and old scripts, and then produce new stories and new scripts of our era, which is what Ai Qing calls "becoming something else." When new ideological content is active inside, content determines form, and as content develops, form changes naturally. So Lu Xun said: "Old forms are adopted, there must be deletions, and since there are deletions, there must be additions. The result is the emergence of new forms, which is also a transformation." Isn't this naturally producing what Ai Qing calls "becoming something else"? This is an inevitable scientific law. No matter how much you oppose becoming "something else," it cannot be stopped. This is our opera reform work policy—bringing forth the new from the old. If you don't become "something else," then there is only "myth for myth's sake"—a dead end.

    You say myths cannot allude to reality? I say they can. You say you can't use myths to reflect resisting America and aiding Korea, defending world peace, etc.? I still say you can. The insignificant "New Heavenly River Match" is his iron proof.

    Now there is this saying: "If you want to write about resisting America and aiding Korea, just write about resisting America and aiding Korea, why must you write it in a myth?" It has now been proven that this is incorrect. It is not necessary to write every myth, and you can write it if you can, and it is wrong to restrict people from writing. It harms the development of work.

    Ai Qing especially opposes my use of a few new-style languages in "New Heavenly River Match," thinking that this is "anti-historicism," and it is inevitable that some people will blur their understanding because of this. A comrade excerpted a passage from "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte," which can answer this question. Marx said:

    "Similarly, a new student who has learned a new language always translates it back into his mother tongue; but he has assimilated the spirit of the new language and can freely express himself in it only when he finds himself in it without recalling the old and when he forgets his native tongue in the use of the new. (omitted) ... And just as at the beginning of their career they anxiously conjure up the spirits of the past, so as to borrow names, battle slogans and costumes from them in order to present the new scene of world history in this time-honoured disguise and this borrowed language."
(Liberation Press edition)

    In the reform of old operas, new languages must go to the stage. Rhetoric and the like are all appropriate and can be discussed; however, to oppose the use of new languages and new meanings in mythological and historical dramas is not in line with historical materialism and dialectical materialism.

    VI. Talking about Opera and Art Criticism

    I think that the main task of a literary and artistic critic is to distinguish right from wrong from the ideological content to the artistic form of literary and artistic works. To distinguish right from wrong, one must go through scientific analysis, point out the advantages and disadvantages, and provide specific opinions for improvement to help the work progress. Everyone knows this common sense. Mr. Ai Qing's "Talking About the Cowherd and Weaver Girl" of course belongs to the scope of literary and artistic criticism, but what did he criticize? I have read it repeatedly several times, and I can't find a single scientific analysis, nor a single constructive specific opinion. The entire article is full of personal preferences and dislikes. What is loved is not necessarily the truth, and what is hated is not necessarily a mistake. What is the use of this kind of article? It only benefits the enemy.

    I think that a literary and artistic critic undertakes a specialized job. Good cultivation and strong ability should stem from enthusiasm, good intentions, and an active attitude of helping. Because the national literary and artistic movement and opera reform movement have produced many deviations and shortcomings, and at the same time, we should see that various places are also improving. Because this is a practical work, related to the general cultural level and personal skills, only by relying on experts to give specific improvement methods, so that this is better than that, can practical results be achieved. Empty talk is of no use at all.

    Writing and performing plays to appear on the stage is a competition. Especially this year, various "Heavenly River Matches" were performed in the people's capital—Beijing. Who is right and who is wrong needs to be commented on, and from the audience, theater troupes, to the competent departments, there have been preliminary comments. Whether it is a script or a literary critique, most of them contain factors of the struggle between the proletariat and the non-proletariat. Facts also tell us that to comment, one must be armed with historical materialism and dialectical materialism, and listen to the opinions of the masses. If he does not have this armament and does not listen to the opinions of the masses, he will inevitably judge based on his own preferences and dislikes. The result is to reverse right and wrong, and reversing right and wrong is a barbaric act that violates the interests of the people. Mr. Ai Qing's "Talking About the Cowherd and Weaver Girl" gave us a big lesson, especially making me deeply realize the harm of this "literature for literature's sake, art for art's sake." It is very likely to confuse people's eyes and even change people's positions, attacking the revolution and benefiting the enemy. This is a special harvest of this year's Double Seventh Festival performance of "Heavenly River Match," leaving a record in the history of opera revolution. It is a revelation of "literature for literature's sake, art for art's sake." Comrades! Strive to eliminate the erroneous thinking of "literature for literature's sake, art for art's sake," and work hard for the victory of proletarian literature and art.

    (Attached) Comrade Yang Shaoxuan's Letter

    I

    After reading the article "Talking About the Cowherd and Weaver Girl" written by Comrade Ai Qing published on the third edition of your newspaper on August 31st, I feel that there are some problems. Please comrades take a closer look, is it due to personal preference that he expresses dissatisfaction with the development of the resisting America and aiding Korea movement? Although the original author may not subjectively be like this, I feel that the objective text seems to be like this. I hope comrades will study it. (September 1st)

    II

    Since reading the article "Talking About the Cowherd and Weaver Girl" written by Ai Qing published on the third edition of the People's Daily on August 31st, I feel that this article is a typical example of "myth for myth's sake," without any thought and unable to solve any problems. But it did one thing, that is, aiming the gun internally and helping the enemy; attacking the workers of resisting America and aiding Korea opera, and helping the American imperialist Truman. Such a so-called article appeared after the review of the film "The Life of Wu Xun," just when American imperialism was sabotaging the truce negotiations. I feel that as a worker of resisting America and aiding Korea, as a peace-loving Chinese people, this is intolerable. Please comrades thoroughly examine this issue. (September 7th)

    III

    I think the manuscript sent has been received. I think that manuscript is only a preliminary study. Now I have written a shorter manuscript and supplemented the issues slightly. I am sending it here for your reference. After Ai Qing's article was published, it immediately produced a bad result, with the following reflections:

    "According to his statement, Lu Xun's 'Old Tales Retold' must be completely negated." "According to his statement, how can ancient myths become new democratic myths?" "This is a bit conservative. What's the point of opera reform?" People with a sense of justice know it but dare not say it. Those who follow the wind will naturally boast for it. In short, it has caused ideological confusion among cadres. I think Ai Qing's article is a revelation of an erroneous thought. It is not simply an article issue, nor is it an issue of a few scripts. In terms of the quality of the article, the four words "low ability and ignorance" are enough; in essence, it violates the opera and art policy. As for the script? After the performance, it all depends on the comments of the masses; in meaning, it raises a serious question, that is, what ideas are dominating the opera and art movement, which is related to the issue of the leadership of the proletarian art movement. For this issue, I will supplement my opinions for your reference. (September 21st)

专栏：

    论“为文学而文学、为艺术而艺术”的危害性
    ——评艾青的“谈牛郎织女”
    杨绍萱
    编者按：本报于八月三十一日刊登了艾青同志所作谈“牛郎织女”一文，指出文艺工作者在他们的创作中，应该正确地对待我们民族的神话传说；要适当地保留原有神话传说的精神，不要任意地、粗暴地破坏古代人民的纯朴的想像。其中并批评到杨绍萱同志的“新天河配”。这篇文章虽有说得不完全的地方，但它的基本观点，是正确的。此文发表后，本报连续收到了杨绍萱同志几封来信反对艾青同志在他的那篇文章中的观点，并认为本报不应该登载那篇文章，要求本报彻底检讨。接着他写了下面这一篇文章。我们认为杨绍萱同志的基本观点和态度都是有错误的。但这是一个关于文艺创作中处理历史题材和神话传说的带有普遍性的问题，值得提出来公开讨论。现将该文和杨绍萱同志的三封来信一并发表如下，望大家讨论。
    我对于文学艺术无多知识，虽然也知道“为文学而文学、为艺术而艺术”这话是不对的，至于它对于人民有什么样的危害性，那是不怎么明确的，我想一般人也会有同感，觉得“为”它一下算得了什么呢？这要没有具体情况摆在眼前，是不容易想像得到的。好了，艾青先生发表的这篇“谈牛郎织女”（原文见八月三十一日人民日报第三版），给我们提供了一个活生生的例子，解答了这个问题。请大家研究研究看。
    一、端正我们对于文艺运动和
    戏曲改革运动的观点
    我们的文艺运动和戏曲改革运动是以无产阶级为领导的广大人民的文化革命的一个组成部分。由于过去的中国还是个半封建社会半殖民地国家，工人阶级和农民群众处在封建法西斯官僚买办阶级的惨酷压迫之下。他们大都失掉了文化教育机会。一般地说他们是没有发言权的，自然就更谈不到多么高的文学艺术水平。只有靠了中国共产党和毛主席所领导的新民主主义革命胜利进展，推翻了封建法西斯反动政权，这样一来，工人阶级和农民群众才获得了政治上的发言权。他们才真正有了文艺运动和戏曲改革运动。从而土地改革也好，抗美援朝也好，便就着各式各样的故事，处理成歌曲、小说、以至剧本而演出于舞台。这些作品，不管是文艺修辞或艺术形式，不消说有若干是很幼稚的和很简陋的。这在封建社会士大夫或资产阶级文学家们看来，会觉得是很粗俗的、很可笑的，以为“难登大雅之堂”的。这个运动越发展，他们就越不满意。我们的看法，恰恰与此相反，而是采取最爱护和尊重的态度。我们也并不讳言幼稚和简陋，而是认为没有幼稚就无所谓壮大，没有简陋也难以想像完美，是做为一个发展过程来看的。谁要想把这种所谓“幼稚”“简陋”的人民戏曲文艺运动连根子都拔了，我们断然是坚决地反对。至于我们自己的工作是从这种所谓“幼稚”“简陋”的基础上求进步，这就是我们对于现实文艺运动和戏曲改革运动的基本态度。
    二、“为神话而神话”的结果是什么
    艾青先生的“谈牛郎织女”这篇文章回答了这个问题。他这样大声疾呼地说：
    “借神话影射现实，结合目前国内外形势，土地改革，镇压反革命，抗美援朝，保卫世界和平等等。……这种倾向发展得最厉害……”
    艾青先生发怒了，就痛骂这是把他认为“原来很美丽的神话加以任意宰割的野蛮行为。”
    你看他所举出的我所写的“新天河配”的“罪证”，有这么四句：“牛郎放牛在山坡，织女手巧能穿梭。织就天罗和地网，捉住鸱枭得平和。”按艾青的逻辑，这都属于“野蛮行为”，为什么？因为他以为这“鸱枭”是“影射”了他文章里的那个“杜鲁门”，其实说，艾青先生是神经过敏了，我写的那个“鸱枭”只是涵蓄一般性的破坏分子，破坏人家的美满婚姻，破坏生产关系，亦即破坏生产，是封建主义的帮凶，自然里边也可能有帝国主义“杜鲁门”。他为什么这样深恶痛绝地反对影射呢？艾青自己可以这样说他是为了保卫所谓“美丽的神话”，另一方面却是坚决地不许动一动帝国主义“杜鲁门”。
    艾青先生是保卫“美丽的神话”而反对“宰割”的，不许“借神话影射现实”，下文又网开一面，给我们立了一条法规，说：
    “改写的时候必须把主题思想明确起来，把劳动、爱情、反封建这三种基本的观念强调起来。”
    这好像是说神话可以改写，可以影射现实，可以反封建，但是有一点不允许，就是不许“影射反帝国主义”，“鸱枭”二字都用不得，谁要“影射”，就是“野蛮行为”，艾青先生你这是替谁说话呢？这就是“为神话而神话”的结果。
    我想同志们都知道，毛主席讲过“愚公移山”的故事，在这个神话故事里，愚公所要移的是太行王屋二山。毛主席说：我们要移掉这两座大山：一为封建主义之山，一为帝国主义之山。这不是“借神话影射现实”吗？以太行王屋二山“影射”了封建主义和帝国主义。我们都受过这个教育，并且是这样做的，现在还在做，我就写过“愚公移山”这个剧本。照艾青的逻辑这都是要不得的。这要叫做“野蛮行为”，那么“文明行为”又是什么呢？这在他的文章里是有解答的，大家看看吧。
    三、“任意宰割的野蛮行为”
    倒是谁
    艾青痛骂别人是把他所认为“原来很美丽的神话加以任意宰割的野蛮行为”，好像他是唯一的“原来很美丽的神话”的保卫者。请看他怎么讲牛郎织女的神话，先引他讲的第一个，他说：
    “织女是天帝的第七个孙女，在天河东面织云锦天衣，牛郎在河西面看牛，两人都很勤勉，天帝爱怜他们，让他们结婚，婚后两人贪图逸乐，荒弃劳动，天帝发怒，使之分开，中间隔天河，命乌鸦去告诉他们七天见面一次，乌鸦传错了话，说成每年七月七日见面一次。”
    这是“原来”的吗？断然不是的，而是在艾青笔下有了宰割的。这个原来的神话，不必远取，就在八月二十日新民报第五版署名菊农者所引：
    “天河之东有织女，天帝之子也。年年机杼劳役，织成云锦天衣，天帝怜其独处，许嫁河西牵牛郎。嫁后，遂废织絍，天帝怒，责令归河东，唯每年七月七日夜渡河一会。”
    宋代张来的七夕词：
    “人间一叶梧桐飘，蓐收行会回斗杓。神官召集役灵鹊，直渡银河云做桥。河东美人天帝子，机杼年年劳玉指。织成云雾紫真衣，辛苦无欢容不理。帝怜独居无与娱，河西嫁与牵牛夫。自从嫁后废织絍，绿鬓云鬟朝夕梳。贪欢不归天帝怒，谪归却踏来时路，但令一岁一相逢，七月七日河边渡。……”
    案荆楚岁时记的版本或有待考之处，而这种引证是严肃的，两项记载大体上是一致的。在艾青笔下的神话却大加了宰割，你看，牛郎织女原是两个男女劳动者，天帝怒恼了，就限制和剥夺了一对夫妻的婚姻权，这个天帝比封建主还厉害，真是象征着奴隶主。两项记载虽出士大夫之手，这个罪恶行为依然记在天帝的头上。到了艾青先生的笔下，天帝的罪行就转嫁到乌鸦的身上，也就是把反动统治者的罪行转嫁于别人的身上。放走了敌人，加罪于人民。人家原来富有阶级对立属性的神话，你把阶级斗争给模糊了，这是为了什么？这是“文明行为”吗？所以真正“任意宰割的野蛮行为”并不属于别人，只能属于艾青自己，这不是明明白白的事实吗？
    再看他讲第二个故事，他说：
    “织女是王母娘娘的外孙女，在天上织云彩；牛郎是人间的一个看牛郎，受兄嫂虐待。一天牛告诉他织女和别的仙女要到银河沐浴，叫他去取一件仙衣，织女找衣服的时候，他去还给她，并要她和他结婚，她一定会答应，牛郎就这样做了。织女和牛郎结婚后，生一男一女。王母娘娘知道了，把织女捉回去，牛告诉了牛郎，他可以把它的皮披在身上，追到天上去。等牛郎挑了两个小孩追到天上时，王母娘娘拔下发簪在织女背后一划，就成天河，把这一对夫妇隔开了，但他们常常隔河相望啼泣，感动了王母娘娘，于是允许他们每年七月七日相会一次。相会时，由喜鹊架成桥。……”
    艾青先生说了他是“比较喜欢第二种”的，可是照艾青的逻辑这第二种是被“宰割”了的，因为原来的是天上神话，第二种却加入了一半人间故事，天帝被“宰割”为王母。艾青自然可以说，这不叫宰割而叫创造，哦，一个神话原是历代可以有创造的，那么在伟大的人民革命时代为什么就不许“借神话影射现实”而加以创造呢？人家有了一点儿创造，就又痛骂为“野蛮行为”，这所表现的思想是如此混淆和无理。
    四、“模糊了”原来神话的意义又是谁
    艾青先生屡次三番地说人家“把原来的神话传说一脚踢开”，“已找不到原有神话的线索”，“使原有神话的线索完全模糊了。”这是瞪着眼睛说瞎话，因为任何一个编剧者既要采用牛郎织女神话故事，或多或少或好或坏虽等等不齐，总会有“神话的线索”，想完全没有线索是不可能的。要说真正“模糊了”原有神话的意义，说“一脚踢开”，在艾青先生自然不是用脚踢的，可是我们亲眼看见他是用手拿笔拨开的，而“模糊了”原有神话的真正意义。在第一种神话里，他是用手拿笔把天帝剥夺劳动人民婚姻自由的罪行写在了乌鸦的账上，即把反动统治者的罪行他亲笔转写在人民的头上，这样才真正使一般读者找不到为什么产生这个神话意义的线索。这且不谈。再看他怎么讲第二种神话，他说“王母娘娘……允许他们每年七月七日相会一次。相会时由喜鹊架成桥。”艾青怎么解释呢？他说：这“是一首极美的想像的诗”。“喜鹊搭桥使牛郎织女能见面。”这也是真正模糊了原来神话的意义，应该说是一种歪曲。你看吧，“每年七月七日相会一次”这是王母娘娘圣旨钦定的，所谓喜鹊或百鸟搭桥是在这个圣旨钦定之下进行的。如果说喜鹊或百鸟象征群众的话，那么这种群众是在受着王母封建主义的奴役呀。这个神话不明明是烙着封建阶级的烙印吗？由此可见，艾青所喜爱的神话，所欣赏的所谓“优美”“极美”等等，那里边是充满着人民的痛苦呀。所以说，真正模糊了原来神话的线索，特别是模糊了意义，不是别人，而恰恰是艾青自己。这还不明白吗？对于一个神话故事要没有经过科学的分析，那就只能产生胡涂观念，这也是“为神话而神话”的写照。
    五、“完全成了另外一个
    东西了”
    “完全成了另外一个东西了。”艾青先生，你这话算说对了，“完全”固不敢说，但是我们就是要成为“另外一个东西”的。这句话对于艾青先生来说，恰好证明他是一个典型的“为神话而神话”主义者。如果要不成为“另外一个东西”的话，那就只有原封不动，要动就要变样儿，成为“另外一个东西。”历史与革命就是这样无情，它是不管你是什么“为文学而文学、为神话而神话”文学家们愿意不愿意，它是一股劲儿在那里变，这我们有丰富的经验，就是这种变一定会引起封建社会的士大夫和资产阶级的文学家们的不满，他们以为“幼稚”“简陋”而不堪入目，以至痛骂为“野蛮行为”，只是他们没有办法来阻挠这个变，那么怎么办呢？那就只有由惋惜而痛骂了。
    艾青先生是不喜欢“成另一个东西”的，可是看他所举的两个牛郎织女故事，第二种明明是把第一种“宰割了”，又加上别的东西，就成了第二种的“另一个东西了”，而艾青先生又明明在说他“喜欢第二种”，这是又喜欢“另外一个东西了”。这不是自己拿着自己开玩笑吗？
    在这里谈谈为什么必然成为“另外一个东西”？我们要执行政务院“关于戏曲改革工作的指示”，要做到“人民戏曲是以民主精神与爱国精神教育广大人民的重要武器”，要想完成这个任务，就必须通过历史唯物论和辩证唯物论，对于旧故事旧剧本施以科学地分析和适当地批判，然后产生我们这时代的新故事新剧本，也就是艾青所说的“成了另外一个东西”。当有新的思想内容在里边活动的时候，内容决定形式，内容发展则形式自起变化，所以鲁迅说：“旧形式是采取，必有所删除，既有所删除，必有所增益，这结果是新形式的出现，也就是变革。”这不是很自然地产生了艾青所说的“成了另外一个东西”吗？这是一条必然的科学规律，不管你怎么样反对成为“另外一个东西”那是一点儿也阻挠不住的。这是我们戏曲改革工作的方针——推陈出新。要是不成为“另外一个东西”，那就只有“为神话而神话”——死路一条。
    你说神话不能影射现实吗？我说能的。你说不能借神话反映抗美援朝，保卫世界和平等等吗？我还是说能的。这个微不足道的“新天河配”就是他的铁证。
    现在有这种说法：“写抗美援朝就写抗美援朝完了，何必一定在神话里写呢”？现已证明这不正确，不是一定每个神话都写，而且可以写就写，限制人家不写是错误的，伤害工作的发展。
    艾青特别反对我在“新天河配”用了几句新式语言，以为这是“反历史主义”，难免有人为此模糊了认识。有同志节录过一段“拿破仑第三政变记”，可以回答这个问题。马克思这样说：
    “同样地，新学生学了新的语言，也总是把新的语言译成他的本国的语言。但是，只有当他在运用新语言时再不想到旧语言，并且在运用新语言时忘记了祖传语言之际，他才融会了新语言底精神，才能自由地以新语表达其思想。（中略）……所以，在那些革命中，唤起已死的人物，其目的是在于赞美新的斗争，而不在于仿效旧的斗争。……不在于使它的幽灵重新起来行走。”
    （解放社版）
    在旧剧改革中，一定有新语言走向舞台，修辞自难都很恰当，可以商讨；但是，要一味地反对神话剧历史剧运用新语言和新涵义，那是不合历史唯物论和辩证唯物论的。
    六、谈谈戏曲文艺评论
    我想做为一个文艺评论家，他的主要任务就是从文艺作品的思想内容以至艺术形式里辨别是非，要辨别是非就必须通过科学的分析，指出优缺点，提供可供改进的具体意见，帮助工作进步，这样的常识是大家都知道的。艾青先生这篇“谈牛郎织女”当然属于文艺评论范围，可是他评了什么呢？我反复地看了好几遍，找不出一条够得上科学的分析，找不出一条建设性的具体意见，充满全文的是个人的偏爱偏憎，爱的既不一定是真理，憎的也不一定是过错，这种文章有什么用处呢？资敌而已。
    我想做为一个文艺评论家，所担任的是一种专门工作，修养好，能力强，应该是出于热诚善意采取积极帮助的态度。因为全国性的文艺运动和戏曲改革运动，那是出过很多偏差和缺点的，同时也应看到各地方也都在改进。由于这是一个实际工作，关系着一般文化水平和个人技能的问题，只有靠着专家们给以具体的改进办法，做到此胜于彼，才能收到实效，说空话是丝毫没有用处的。
    编剧演戏而出现于舞台，这是一个比赛。特别是今年在人民的首都——北京演出了各式各样的“天河配”。究竟谁对谁不对，那是需要评论的，并且从观众、剧团班社到主管部门是已经有了初步评论的。剧本也好、文学评论也好，大多存在了无产阶级和非无产阶级的斗争因素。事实又告诉了我们，要评论就得有历史唯物论和辩证唯物论的武装，倾听群众的意见，如果没有这副武装也不倾听群众的意见，他就必然要凭自己的偏爱偏憎去判断，结果是颠倒是非，颠倒是非才是野蛮行为，违反人民利益。艾青先生这篇“谈牛郎织女”给我们上了一大课，特别使我深深地认识到，这个“为文学而文学，为艺术而艺术”的危害性，它很会迷糊人的眼睛以至改变人的立场的，打击了革命而便宜了敌人。这是今年农历七夕乞节演出“天河配”的特种收获，戏曲革命史上留下了一笔记录，它是一篇“为文学而文学、为艺术而艺术”的现形记。同志们！为肃清“为文学而文学、为艺术而艺术”的错误思想而奋斗，为无产阶级文艺胜利而努力。
    （附）杨绍萱同志来信
    一
    我读到八月三十一日贵报第三版所发表的艾青同志所写“谈牛郎织女”一篇文章，觉得有些问题。请同志们仔细看看，是不是由于个人的偏爱，对于抗美援朝运动的发展表示了不满呢？原作者虽主观上未必是这样，我觉得在客观文字上似是这样的。希望同志们研究一下。（九月一日）
    二
    自八月三十一日在人民日报第三版上读到艾青所写的“谈牛郎织女”一篇文章，我觉得这篇文章是“为神话而神话”的典型，没有任何思想，不能解决任何问题。但它却做了一件事，就是枪口对内，帮助敌人；打击的是抗美援朝戏曲工作者，帮助的是美帝国主义杜鲁门。这样的所谓文章乃出现于检讨电影“武训传”之后，正当美帝国主义破坏停战谈判的时候。我觉得做为一个抗美援朝工作者，做为一个爱好和平的中国人民，这是不能容忍的。请同志们彻底检讨这个问题。（九月七日）三
    寄去的文稿想已收到。刻想那篇稿子仅系初步的研究。现在我又写了一篇比较短的稿子，同时把问题稍加补充兹特送上，请供参考。艾青那篇文章发表之后，立时产生了一种恶果，有这样几种反映：
    “照他这说法，鲁迅的‘故事新编’就得全部否定。”“照他这说法，古代神话故事怎么变成新民主主义的神话故事呢？”“这有点保守主义，戏曲改革还改个什么劲儿呢？”有正义感的人虽知之而不敢说。看风行船的人那自然为它吹嘘。总之，造成了干部中思想的混乱。我认为艾青这篇文章是一种错误思想的透露，不是单纯一篇文章问题，也不是为了什么个把剧本的问题。论文章的成色，有“低能无知”四个字就够了；在本质上则是违反了戏曲文艺政策。剧本呢？演出之后，全靠群众评论；在意义上，它是引出了一个严重问题，那就是什么思想在支配着戏曲文艺运动，这就关系了无产阶级文艺运动领导权的问题。为了这个问题，把意见补充一下，请做参考。（九月二十一日）
