    Serious Waste Occurring in Some Rural Areas of Nantong Prefecture

    Editor: Currently, various regions are carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy. However, in the vast rural areas of Nantong Prefecture, serious waste has occurred since the autumn harvest. In Xinmin Village, Yanming Township, Nantong County, two households spent 15 million yuan on religious ceremonies; Chen Youde and his brothers in Jianjue Village, Sili Township, spent 300 catties of ginned cotton on religious ceremonies. In Wenzhao Village and Shigui Village, Shengli Township, Rudong County, ten monks were invited to perform rituals for several days, costing nearly 4,000 catties of rice. From August to October, Wuyi Township, Shuangde Township, and Fengli Town held a total of 190 religious ceremonies, spending over 150,000 catties of rice. In rural areas, not only ordinary farmers perform these ceremonies, but also some rural cadres. For example, Comrade Hong, the Party branch secretary of Xinli Township, Rudong County, spent more than 3,000 catties of rice on religious ceremonies; Wu Huoyu, the village chief of Junnian Village, Xinxing Township, said he had no money to subscribe to newspapers for learning when he was encouraged to do so, but he spent nearly 4,000 catties of rice on religious ceremonies. This phenomenon of superstition and waste cannot be ignored, especially for cadres, who must lead by example and oppose this superstition and waste in order to educate and lead the masses. It is hoped that the leading organs at all levels in Nantong Prefecture will pay serious attention to this.

### 南通专区部分农村中  发生严重的浪费现象

    南通专区部分农村中
    发生严重的浪费现象
    编辑同志：目前各地正在开展增产节约运动，但是南通专区广大农村，在秋收以后，却发生了严重的浪费现象。南通县彦明乡新民村有两户做斋，共花去一千五百万元；四烈乡坚决村陈有德兄弟四人做斋花去皮棉三百斤。东县胜利乡文照村、施桂村请十个和尚做了几天斋，花去近四千斤稻子；五义、双德二乡和丰利镇从八月到十月共计做了一百九十场斋事，费去稻子达十五万斤以上。在农村中，不仅一般农民做斋，而且有的农村干部也这样做。如东县新利乡的中共支部书记洪同志做斋花去三千多斤稻子；新兴乡俊年村村长吴火裕，别人动员他订阅报纸学习，他说没钱，可是在做斋上却花掉近四千斤稻子。这种迷信、浪费的现象是不容忽视的，特别是作为一个干部，必须以身作则，反对这种迷信、浪费的现象，才能教育、领导群众。希望南通专区各级领导机关严重注意。
