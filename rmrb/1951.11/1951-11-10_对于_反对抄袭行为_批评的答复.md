Reply to Criticism of "Opposing Plagiarism"

Editor: I am very grateful for the "Cultural Life Brief Review" in the People's Daily on October 28th, which criticized the publication of my play "Cow's Illness."

Last April, I was working in the Hebei Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles' Opera Reform Working Committee. The committee decided to reprint several small plays from other regions for rural theater troupes in Hebei Province to perform. At that time, I was assigned to revise Wang Xinxiu's "Rotten Beef," published in "Pingyuan Literature," and submit it to the Hebei People's Publishing House for publication. It was written at the time as "Adapted by the Hebei Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles' Opera Reform Committee." However, after the book was printed, my name was printed on it. Then one mistake led to another, so that the Beijing People's Publishing House also used my name when compiling and printing it. I have always been very vain and cared about face, and I always felt embarrassed to declare this matter and dared not face it. It was not until I saw the criticism in the newspaper that I decided to put this burden down. I accept this criticism and will work hard to correct myself, and I will never make such mistakes in future work. And I express my apology to Comrade Wang Xinxiu.

专栏：对人民日报批评建议的反应

    对于“反对抄袭行为”批评的答复
    编辑同志：十月二十八日人民日报“文化生活简评”批评了我出版“牛儿的病”剧本的问题，我十分感谢。
    去年四月，我在河北省文联戏曲改革工作委员会工作，该会决定翻印几个外区小剧本供河北省农村剧团演唱，当时分配我将王辛酉同志在“平原文艺”上发表的“烂牛肉”修改一下，送河北省人民出版社出版。当时写的是“河北省文联戏改会改编”。但书印成后，却印上了我的名字。其后一误再误，以致北京人民出版社编印时也用了我的名字。我自己一向很虚荣，爱面子，总觉得不好意思声明这件事，不敢正视这件事。直到看到了报上的批评，才决定要把这个包袱放下来。我接受这个批评，要努力改正自己，在将来的工作中，决不再发生这样的错误。并向王辛酉同志表示歉意。
    河北省文联    刘正平
