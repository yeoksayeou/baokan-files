Xinhua News Agency, dated the 4th: The continuous improvement of the material and cultural living standards of the Soviet people fully demonstrates the superiority of the Soviet system established after the October Revolution.

The income of the Soviet working people continues to increase. In 1950, the total income of employees and farmers, calculated at comparable prices, increased by 62% compared to the pre-war year of 1940. In the first three quarters of this year, the income of employees greatly exceeded the level of the same period last year. In May of this year, the income of collective farmers also increased by 19% compared to last year.

The living welfare expenses received by the Soviet people from the state have also greatly increased. This year, the Soviet National Social Insurance Fund allocated 21.1 billion rubles, an increase of 3 billion rubles compared to last year. Working people universally enjoy benefits such as free medical care, sickness allowances, old-age insurance, and vacations. This year, 1.27 billion rubles were used to maintain sanatoriums and rest homes. At present, Soviet trade unions have nearly 1,200 sanatorium institutions. In addition, the Ministry of Health and other ministries and enterprises of the government have also opened hundreds of sanatoriums and rest homes. Women's welfare has also been improved. This year, maternity leave allowances for women increased by 124 million rubles, totaling 1.495 billion rubles. Nurseries and kindergartens have been established throughout the Soviet Union. This year, more than 5 million children spent the summer in the countryside.

The improvement of the living standards of the Soviet people is also reflected in the increase in the production and sales of food and consumer goods. In the first three quarters of this year, the output of meat and canned food in the Soviet Union increased by 18% compared to the same period last year, and the output of dairy products and canned dairy products increased by 50%. In the third quarter of this year, meat sales increased by 19% compared to the same quarter last year, silk fabrics increased by 33%, furniture increased by 49%, spices and cosmetics increased by 20%, and bicycles increased to 2.3 times.

The working people have obtained a large number of new houses. Since the beginning of this year, the government has generally built apartment houses for workers in various industries. Miners alone have obtained new residences with a ground area of more than one million square meters. More than 10,000 employees in the metallurgical industry have moved into new apartments. In addition, the Soviet people also receive long-term loans from the state to build private houses.

The cultural life of the Soviet people has also been greatly improved. This year, the Soviet education expenditure reached 59 billion rubles, more than two and a half times the pre-war level of 1940. The number of national higher education institutions has increased to 890. This year, universities and research institutes broke previous records and admitted a total of 350,000 new students, with a total student population of more than 1.3 million, an increase of more than 50,000 from last year. In order to universally implement seven-year and ten-year education, many new schools have been added in various places. For example, the Kazakh Republic opened a total of 300 new schools this year, and the number of existing schools increased by 1,200 compared to the pre-war year of 1940.

Workers' spare-time education is highly valued. This year, there are 19 correspondence institutes and more than 460 correspondence departments and night schools affiliated to regular universities nationwide, enrolling workers who have finished middle school and joined the workforce. There are more than 110,000 worker students in higher correspondence schools, and about 600,000 young workers are attending middle school night schools. The number of cultural and recreational institutions of trade unions has exceeded the pre-war level. At present, there are more than 8,000 workers' clubs and cultural palaces, 9,500 large libraries, more than 90,000 reading rooms and recreation rooms, and thousands of cinemas nationwide. ＊＊＊＊＊＊

　　苏联人民物质和文化生活水平日益提高
　  劳动人民的收入和从国家得到的生活福利费用大为增加
    【新华社四日讯】苏联人民的物质和文化生活水平的日益提高，充分说明了十月革命后，建立起来的苏维埃制度的优越性。
    苏联劳动人民的收入在继续增加。在一九五○年，职工收入和农民收入总额，以比较价格计算，就比战前一九四○年增加了百分之六十二。今年头三季，职工的收入又大大超过了去年同期的水平。在今年五月，集体农民的收入也比去年增加了百分之十九。
    苏联人民从国家得到的生活福利费用也已大大增加。今年苏联国家社会保险基金的拨款达二百一十一亿卢布，比去年增加了三十亿卢布。劳动人民普遍享受到免费医疗、疾病津贴、养老保险和休假等利益。今年用于维持疗养院和休养所的费用为十二亿七千卢布。现在苏联工会共有将近一千二百个疗养机关，此外，卫生部和政府其他各部和各企业，也开办了数百个疗养院和休养所。妇女的福利事业也有增进。今年的妇女产假津贴增加了一亿二千四百万卢布，总数达十四亿九千五百万卢布。苏联各地已遍设了托儿所和幼稚园，今年在乡间过暑假的儿童就有五百多万人。
    苏联人民生活水平的提高也反映在食品和消费品的产量和销售量的增加上。在今年头三季，苏联肉类和罐头食品的产量比去年同期增加了百分之十八，乳品和罐头乳品的产量增加了百分之五十。今年第三季的肉类销售量比去年同季增加了百分之十九，丝织品增加了百分之三十三，家具增加了百分之四十九，香料和化妆品增加了百分之二十，脚踏车增加到二点三倍。
    劳动人民已获得了大量新的房屋。今年年初以来，政府就普遍为各业工人建造公寓房屋，单是矿工就得到了地面面积超过一百万平方公尺的新住宅。冶金工业已有一万户以上的职工迁入了新的公寓。此外，苏联人民还得到国家的长期贷款来建造私人住宅。
    苏联人民的文化生活也大为提高了。今年苏联教育经费达五百九十亿卢布，为战前一九四○年水平的两倍半以上。全国高等教育机关的数目已增加为八百九十所。今年各大学和研究所打破以往纪录，共接收了三十五万新生，学生总人数已超过一百三十万人，比去年增加了五万人以上。为了普遍实施七年制和十年制教育，各地已增设了许多新学校。例如哈萨克共和国今年共开办三百所新学校，现有的学校数目比战前一九四○年增加了一千二百所。
    工人业余教育很受重视。今年全国已有十九个函授研究所和四百六十多个正规高等学校附设的函授部和夜校，招收读完中学就参加工作的工人。高等函授学校的工人学生达十一万多人，约有六十万青年工人在中级夜校上课。工会的文化娱乐机构的数目已超过战前水平，现在全国共有八千多个工人俱乐部和文化宫，九千五百个大型图书馆，九万多个阅览室和游艺室，和数千个电影院。＊＊＊＊＊＊
