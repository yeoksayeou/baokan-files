　　Organizing to Increase Yield Per Unit Area
　　Shanxi Many Mutual Aid Teams Create New Records for Collective Bumper Harvests
　　Under the leadership of labor model Li Shunda's mutual aid team, nearly 100,000 agricultural mutual aid teams in Shanxi Province launched an unprecedented patriotic bumper harvest campaign this year. During the competition, all mutual aid teams universally increased the yield per unit area. This vivid fact further demonstrates the superiority of organizing.
　　The nationally famous patriotic labor model Li Shunda's mutual aid team in Xigou Village, Pingshun, had a bumper harvest this year. Under Li Shunda's leadership, the whole team actively responded to the Party and government's calls, and at the beginning of spring, formulated a production plan for the whole team to increase the average yield of raw grain by 21 jin per mu compared to last year, and challenged national labor models and mutual aid teams to launch a patriotic bumper harvest competition. During the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the patriotic consciousness of the whole team was unprecedentedly enhanced, and everyone unified increasing production to support national defense construction with improving their own lives. The whole team regularly studied current affairs and politics, and delved into and improved technology. Democratic leadership and scientific division of labor were implemented within the team, giving full play to the wisdom of each team member. The production tasks of each season were implemented with short arrangements, frequent inspections, and systematic summaries, so the production plan of each season was completed ahead of schedule. The 71.6 mu of autumn land of the whole team yielded an average of 382 jin of raw grain per mu, an increase of 25 jin compared to last year, exceeding the original planned increase of 4 jin, and an increase of 109.7 percent compared to the production level before the War of Resistance Against Japan.
　　Labor model Zhang Zhiquan's mutual aid team in Dazhai Village, Yueshe, was the first to respond to the patriotic bumper harvest competition challenge proposed by Li Shunda's mutual aid team, and challenged labor models and mutual aid teams in the entire special district and county. Within the mutual aid team, there was also competition between households and individuals. Throughout the year, all team members maintained a high degree of patriotic production enthusiasm, made a patriotic production increase pact, and constantly revised it according to changes in the situation and production seasons, so that production and patriotism were closely integrated. Zhang Zhiquan's team is a model mutual aid team for improving technology in Shanxi Province. The team used various new agricultural tools and created an excellent small farm. Zhang Zhiquan's team fertilized according to the land, planted according to the land, and kept seedlings according to the land, so all kinds of crops grew better than others. This year, the whole team planted 208 mu of land, harvested a total of 346 shi of grain, with an average yield of 1.64 dou per mu, an increase of 1.66 dou compared to last year.
　　Labor model Wang Jinyun's mutual aid team in Yaoshanggou, Wuxiang, had a bumper harvest this year, greatly exceeding the patriotic bumper harvest competition plan. The whole team planted 65.8 mu of millet, and actually harvested 18,200 jin of grain, with an average yield of more than 270 jin per mu. The whole team planted 23.6 mu of Golden Queen corn, and actually harvested 12,750 jin of corn. The average yield of grain per mu of all land (autumn fields and wheat fields combined) was 1.86 dou converted to millet, an increase of 37.7 percent compared to last year, and an increase of 82.3 percent compared to the output before the War of Resistance Against Japan.
　　Labor model Guo Yu'en's mutual aid team in Chuandi Village, Pingshun, had a bumper harvest on all cultivated land this year. This team has already combined production and politics, consolidated mutual aid teams and improved technology, and combined agricultural and sideline production. Throughout the year, the whole team implemented diligent planning, short arrangements, in-depth inspections, and seasonal summaries. The production and labor enthusiasm of each team member exceeded any previous year, so they achieved amazing bumper harvest results this year. The whole team planted 92.2 mu of land, originally planning to increase the yield by 70 jin per mu. The summary and evaluation results showed that the yield increased by 84 jin per mu, exceeding the plan by 14 jin. The team's output last year had already exceeded the production level before the War of Resistance Against Japan by more than double. This year, the yield per mu exceeded last year's output by 25 percent. Compared with before the War of Resistance Against Japan, it has exceeded 127.5 percent. After actual investigation, the Pingshun County People's Government believes that Guo Yu'en's team is the model bumper harvest mutual aid team with the highest increase in yield per unit area in the county.
　　Labor model Shi Cunjin's mutual aid team in Huojia Yao, Licheng, is the most outstanding team in the village in terms of increasing yield per unit area in this year's patriotic bumper harvest competition. The whole team has 13 households and plants 161 mu of land. Throughout the year, they processed fertilizer, worked diligently, and improved technology, so that every item of the competition plan was realized, and the yield per mu increased. This year, the whole team planted 55 mu of millet, with an average yield of 2.71 dou per mu, an increase of 0.41 dou compared to last year; planted 41 mu of corn, with an average yield of 2.52 dou per mu, an increase of 0.42 dou compared to last year. The original plan this year was to increase the yield by 0.15 dou per mu. The total output of the whole team was 453.2 shi converted to millet, with an average harvest of more than 2.76 dou per mu, exceeding the increase plan by 0.39 dou, and an increase of 0.54 dou per mu compared to last year.
　　Labor model Li Sihai's mutual aid team in Beizhang Village, Fourth District, Taiyuan City, had an average yield of 0.94 dou per mu last year, which was already higher than the average yield level in the area. In this year's patriotic bumper harvest competition, the whole team actively responded to the government's call, gave full play to their high patriotic production enthusiasm, processed and cultivated land, and improved technology, achieving greater bumper harvest results. The whole team planted 228.9 mu of land, originally planning to increase the average yield by 0.15 dou per mu. As a result, they produced a total of 304.4 shi of grain, with an average yield of 1.33 dou per mu, an increase of 0.39 dou compared to last year, and an increase of 0.24 dou per mu exceeding the increase plan.

　　组织起来提高单位面积产量
    山西许多互助组创集体丰产新纪录
    山西省近十万个农业互助组，在劳动模范李顺达互助组带动下，在今年展开了空前规模的爱国丰产竞赛运动。在竞赛运动中，所有互助组普遍提高了单位面积产量。这一生动事实，进一步显示了组织起来的优越性。
    全国著名的平顺西沟村爱国劳动模范李顺达领导的互助组，今年全组丰收。全组在李顺达领导下，积极响应党和政府的各项号召，开春就订出全组每亩比去年平均增产二十一斤原粮的生产计划，并向全国劳动模范和互助组提出开展爱国丰产竞赛的挑战。全组在抗美援朝运动中，爱国主义觉悟空前提高，每个人都把增加生产支援国防建设，和改善自己生活统一起来了。全组经常学习时事政治，钻研与改进技术。组内实行了民主领导，科学分工，发挥了每个组员的智慧。每个季节的生产任务，都是实行短安排，勤检查，系统总结，因此，每季的生产计划，都是提前完成的。全组秋地七十一亩六分，每亩平均产原粮三百八十二斤，比去年增产二十五斤，超过了原订增产计划四斤，比抗日战争前的生产水平提高百分之一百零九点七。
    榆社大寨村劳动模范张志全互助组，首先响应了李顺达互助组提出的爱国丰产竞赛挑战，并向全专区和全县的劳动模范和互助组提出挑战。在互助组内，户与户、人和人也展开竞赛。一年中，全体组员保持了高度的爱国生产热情，订了爱国增产公约，并按时局变化和生产季节不断修改，使生产和爱国紧密结合起来。张志全组是山西全省改进技术的模范互助组，组内使用了各样新式农具，创办了出色的小农场。张志全组作到因地施肥，因地下种，看地留苗，因此，各种庄稼长得都比别人好。今年全组种地二百零八亩，共收粮三百四十六石，每亩平均产一石六斗四升，比去年增产一斗六升六。
    武乡窑上沟劳动模范王锦云领导的互助组，今年全组丰收，大大超过了爱国丰产竞赛计划。全组种谷六十五亩八分，实收粮一万八千二百斤，每亩平均产二百七十余斤。全组种金皇后玉茭二十三亩六分，实收玉茭一万二千七百五十斤。全部土地（秋田、麦田合计）平均每亩收粮折谷一石八斗六升，每亩比去年提高产量百分之三十七点七，超过抗日战争前产量百分之八十二点三。
    平顺川底村劳动模范郭玉恩互助组，今年全部耕地都庆丰收。该组今年已作到生产和政治结合，巩固互助组与改进技术结合，农业副业生产结合。全组全年贯彻了勤计划，短安排，深入检查，按季总结，每个组员的生产劳动情绪超过以往任何一年，因此今年取得了惊人的丰收成绩。全组种地九十二亩二分，原计划每亩增产七十斤，总结评比结果，每亩增产八十四斤，超过计划十四斤。该组去年已超过抗日战争前生产水平一倍多，今年每亩又超过去年产量百分之二十五。和抗日战争前相比，已超过百分之一百二十七点五。平顺县人民政府经过实际调查，认为郭玉恩组是全县提高单位面积产量最高的模范丰产互助组。
    黎城霍家窑劳动模范石寸金互助组，是全村今年爱国丰产竞赛运动中，取得提高单位面积产量成绩最突出的一个组。全组十三户，种地一百六十一亩。全年加工施肥、勤劳耕作、改进技术，使竞赛计划条条实现，作到了亩亩增产。今年全组共种谷五十五亩，每亩平均收二石七斗一升，比去年增产四斗一升；种玉茭四十一亩，每亩平均收二石五斗二升，比去年平均产量增产四斗二。今年原计划每亩增产一斗五升，全组土地实产物共折谷四百五十三石二斗，每亩平均收获二石七斗六升多，超过增产计划三斗九升，每亩比去年增产五斗四升。
    太原市四区北张村劳动模范李四海互助组，去年全组每亩平均产量为九斗四升，已较当地平均产量水平为高。今年在爱国丰产竞赛运动中。全组积极响应政府号召，发挥了高度爱国生产积极性，加工耕作，改进技术，取得了更大丰产成绩。全组种地二百二十八亩九分，原计划平均每亩增产一斗五升，结果共产粮三百零四石四斗，每亩平均产粮一石三斗三升，比去年增产三斗九升，每亩超过增产计划二斗四升。（本报综合）
