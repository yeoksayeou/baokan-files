Dimitrovgrad

——From "Black Sea to Baltic Sea" - Part 4——

Xinhua News Agency Correspondent in Prague Wu Wentao

In the living room of the "Balkan Travel Agency" in Dimitrovgrad, after having lunch with the construction director and Soviet engineers, I was accompanied by someone from the Dimitrovgrad Party Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party to climb to the roof of the nearly completed ten-story "Stalin Chemical Fertilizer Factory" to overlook the new city of the new society – Dimitrovgrad.

The Maritsa River makes a semi-circular bend near the Rakovski railway station. For centuries, what people knew about this wheat and vegetable producing area were the three dilapidated villages of Rakovski, Malinovo, and Chino Konievo, and the peasants who lived in adobe houses and fought against taxes, disasters, and diseases. September 9, 1944, the long night had passed, and dawn broke. On a morning in May 1947, countless men and women wearing Youth League uniforms came from all over the country and got off at Rakovski Station. With infinite confidence in the future, they said to the surprised peasants: "We are going to build a big city here, a city with neat roads and squares, with large factories and gardens!" On the eve of September 9, 1947 (Bulgarian National Day), these tens of thousands of young builders erected a sign on a large foundation that had been cleared, which read: "Dimitrovgrad". In just four years, on the flat ground where the "Dimitrovgrad" sign was planted, the ten-story giant building under our feet and rows of new houses appeared!

What a lovely, rudimentary, modern industrial city! Looking along the river, at the western end, a series of brand-new gray-white large buildings have chimneys spewing thick smoke, that is the "Vulkan" cement factory, which has already started production and has an annual output of up to 200,000 tons. To the right, about one kilometer away surrounded by jungles, are hundreds of three-story workers' residences. Living here, in addition to the workers of the cement plant and other workers, are also the miners of the Maritsa coal mine beyond the mountain. The coal quality of this mine is relatively poor, but since it will become the main raw material for the chemical fertilizer plant, it is now greatly expanded. From there to where we are standing, the buildings of the City Hall, Party Committee, Trade Union Federation, Grand Theater, and Grand Hotel, as well as the outlines of parks and squares, have been revealed on both sides of the river. Nearby, near the Maritsa River, is the nearly completed "Maritsa No. 3 Power Plant."

The construction of the "Stalin Chemical Fertilizer Factory" is also proceeding at an accelerated pace. Trains transport machines directly to the vicinity of the factory buildings, cranes lift steel beams and gently place them on the roofs of the factory buildings dozens of feet high, electric small transport trains and large trucks are constantly transporting brick and tile materials, and the blue light of electric welding is bursting everywhere... The pulse of the entire Bulgarian people seems to be beating with the rhythm of labor here!

Comrade Dimitrov, the mentor of the Bulgarian people, once gave such a clear instruction on the path and speed of Bulgarian construction: "Our current task is to enable Bulgaria to catch up quickly through industrialization, electrification, and mechanization of the rural economy, and achieve in ten to twenty years the achievements that other countries have achieved in a century." Obviously, this instruction has not only been implemented in Dimitrovgrad, but also throughout Bulgaria. The two-year plan of 1947-1948 not only restored Bulgaria's wartime wounds, but also prepared the conditions for the continued development of the national economy. This increased industrial production by 71.5 percent compared to 1939, making the ratio of industrial production to agricultural production 30 to 70. The five-year plan from 1949 to 1953 will further increase industrial production by 119 percent compared to 1948, of which the ratio of heavy industry and light industry production will be 55.5 to 44.5 (the ratio in 1939 was 20.7 to 79.3). If the heavy industry of Bulgaria before liberation, especially the part that produced tools, was negligible, and about 50 percent of the light industry was direct investment by imperialists, then today, Bulgaria already has newly established large steel machinery plants, large electrical factories, and automobile repair shops and other industrial enterprises. This year alone, 2,400 new enterprises will be completed, including large factories such as the "Stalin Chemical Fertilizer Factory" and the "Maritsa No. 3" power plant.

The socio-economic structure of Bulgaria has undergone fundamental changes. Due to the nationalization of industry and wholesale trade from the end of 1947 to the beginning of 1948, the subsequent transfer of most retail trade to state-owned and cooperative enterprises, and the transfer of most farmers to agricultural cooperatives, 77.1 percent of the total national income this year will belong to state and cooperative enterprises.

When the people firmly hold the power in their own hands, they can change a backward semi-colonial country into an advanced industrialized new country. All these achievements in Bulgaria are obvious evidence.

A worker with cement spots and rust stains on his jacket came over and shook hands with me. I congratulated him and said, "Comrade! Congratulations on your achievements! Tall buildings rise from the ground, this is your achievement..." Before I could finish speaking, the 23-year-old young man named Ivank said抢着: "Our achievements, yes. But it is inseparable from the help of the Soviet Union. We all know that without the help of the Soviet Union and the care of Comrade Stalin, we could not have such achievements. The reason why we named this chemical fertilizer factory 'Stalin Factory' is also here!"

Ivank went on to tell me that in this factory, from the giant cranes and trucks to the machines and steel pipes being installed, almost everything was supplied to Bulgaria by the Soviet Union. Soviet engineers designed the project on behalf of the engineers; a large number of Soviet technicians came to Bulgaria to train young people who had just come out of the countryside and schools to become technicians and engineers before returning. I saw a large photo posted on the wall, this person is the Soviet female welder Gudriavtseva. She used to climb to the steel frame dozens of feet high to work, in order to personally teach her Bulgarian brothers and sisters. Ivank learned to be a welder in this way. Ivank is now gradually becoming a skilled worker, and in the future, he will work with thousands of other young people in this factory built by himself for a long time.

Ivank's words reminded me of my experience of visiting Bulgarian industrial enterprises in the past few days: from the Dimitrov locomotive repair factory in Sofia to the Kolarov automobile repair factory in Plovdiv, when the factory directors and worker comrades talked about their achievements, in addition to thanking the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, they thanked the selfless help of the great socialist country. The Sofia locomotive repair factory, which was destroyed during the war, not only restored its pre-war production level since 1948, but also manufactured locomotives itself with the help of Soviet technicians, which is no small feat. It further stimulated the patriotic production enthusiasm of the factory and even the whole country. I know that a technician named Peterkov in the factory saved the country 62 million leva (equivalent to 124,000 US dollars) because he created a conveyor belt on a machine that manufactures parts. In 1949, the factory began to manufacture road rollers by itself; on the day I visited this year, the entire factory held a conference to celebrate the success of manufacturing the first excavator.

The comrade of the Party Committee told me that there are now 40,000 people engaged in construction in Dimitrovgrad. The "Stalin Chemical Fertilizer Factory" can be completed during the October Revolution Day this year. Its impact on the national economy will be enormous. It is estimated that in the arable land of the country, the production of this factory can supply an average of four to five kilograms of artificial fertilizer per dekar (approximately equivalent to one mu in China). Within fifteen years, a series of food and other industries will appear in Dimitrovgrad. At that time, the three small villages with only a thousand people before will become a new industrial city with a population of 100,000!

Everyone said, "This is Dimitrovgrad, we are proud of its name!" I walked down this large building with nostalgia. In the twilight, the neon lights on the spire of a tall building flashed with brilliance: "Glory to Stalin!"

### 季米特洛夫格勒  从“黑海到波罗的海”之四

　　季米特洛夫格勒
    ——从“黑海到波罗的海”之四——
    新华社驻布拉格记者　吴文焘
    在季米特洛夫格勒“巴尔干旅行社”的客厅里，我和修建主任及苏联工程师一同吃过中饭，就由保加利亚共产党季米特洛夫格勒党委派人陪同攀登行将竣工的“斯大林化学肥料工厂”的十层高楼的屋顶，俯瞰新社会的新城市——季米特洛夫格勒。
    马里乍河在拉考夫斯基火车站附近拐了一个半圆的弯子。多少世纪以来，人们关于这个小麦和菜蔬产地所知道的，就是拉考夫斯基、马林诺、奇诺康聂沃等三个破落的村庄，和住在土坯房子里与捐税、灾害和疾病搏斗的农民。一九四四年九月九日，长夜已过，天破晓了。在一九四七年五月的一个早晨，从全国各地来了无数穿着青年团制服的男女，在拉考夫斯基车站下车。他们带着对未来的无限信心，向惊异的农民们说：“我们要在这里建设一个大城，有着整齐的马路和广场，有着大工厂和花园的城市！”到了一九四七年九月九日（保加利亚国庆日）的前夜，这成千成万的青年建设者们，就在开辟出来一大片地基上，高高竖起一个牌子，上面写着：“季米特洛夫格勒”。才是四年的功夫，在原来插着“季米特洛夫格勒”牌子的平地上，就出现了现在在我们脚下的这个十层的巨厦和成排的新房子！
    这是一座多么可爱的、粗具规模的现代化的工业城市！沿河望去，在西头，一系列崭新灰白色大建筑物的烟囱喷着浓烟，那是已经开始生产的“瓦尔干”洋灰厂，它的年产量可达二十万吨。右边，在约有一公里以外丛林环绕的地方，是成百所三层楼的工人住宅。居住在这里的，除了洋灰厂的工人和其他工人外，还有小山以外马里乍煤矿的矿工。这个矿山的煤质较坏，但由于它将成为化学肥料厂的主要原料，现在是大大扩充了。从那里到我们站的地方，市政厅、党委、总工会、大戏院和大旅社等建筑，以及公园、广场的轮廓，都已在沿河两岸显露出来。附近，靠着马里乍河的是快完工了的“马里乍三号电力厂”。
    “斯大林化学肥料工厂”的建筑也正在加紧进行，火车把机器一直运到厂房附近来，起重机衔起钢梁，轻轻地放到几丈高的厂房顶上，电动的小型运输列车、大卡车、川流不息地搬运着砖瓦材料，电焊的蓝光到处迸裂着……。全保加利亚人民的脉搏似乎都随着这里的劳动节奏在跳动！
    保加利亚人民的导师季米特洛夫同志，对于保加利亚建设的道路和速度，曾作过这样明确的指示：“我们目前的任务，就是经由工业化、电气化和农村经济的机械化，使保加利亚能急起直追，在十年到二十年内，达到别国在一个世纪中所达到的成就。”十分明显的，这个指示不仅已在季米特洛夫格勒实行着，而且已在保加利亚全国范围内实行着。一九四七—一九四八年的两年计划，不仅恢复了保加利亚战时的创伤，而且准备了国家经济继续发展的条件。这使工业生产量较一九三九年增加百分之七十一点五，使工业生产和农业生产的比例成为三○比七○。从一九四九年到一九五三年的五年计划，更将使工业生产量较一九四八年增加百分之一百一十九，其中重工业和轻工业生产的比例将为五五点五比四四点五（一九三九年的比例为二○点七比七九点三）。如果说在解放前保加利亚的重工业，特别是生产工具的部分微不足道，而约百分之五○的轻工业又是帝国主义者的直接投资，那么，今天，保加利亚已经有了新建立的大钢铁机器厂、大电气工厂和汽车修理场等工业企业了。单是今年要完成的新企业，就有二四○○所，其中就包括“斯大林化学肥料厂”和“马里乍三号”电力厂这样的大工厂。
    保加利亚的社会经济机构已发生根本的变化。由于从一九四七年底到一九四八年初工业及批发贸易的国有化，由于随后绝大部分零售贸易的转为国营及合作事业，以及大部分农民转入农业合作社，今年全部国民收入的百分之七十七点一，将属于国家及合作事业。
    当人民把政权稳稳掌握在自己手里的时候，他们便能够把一个落后的半殖民地的国家改变为先进的工业化的新国家，保加利亚的这一切成就就是明显的证据。
    一个套衣上染着水泥点和铁锈的工人走过来，和我握手。我向他致贺说：“同志！庆贺你们的成就！万丈高楼从地起，这是你们的功绩……。”还没等我说完，这位名叫伊万克的二十三岁的青年就抢着说：“我们的成绩，是的。但它是和苏联的帮助分不开的。我们都知道：没有苏联的帮助，没有斯大林同志的关怀，我们是不可能有这样成绩的。我们把这个化学肥料工厂命名为‘斯大林工厂’的原因，也就在这里！”
    伊万克接着告诉我：在这个厂里，从那巨型的起重机和卡车到正在装置的机器和钢管，几乎都是苏联供给保加利亚的。苏联工程师代为设计工程；大量的苏联技术人员到保加利亚来，把新从农村、学校里出来的青年们训练成为技工、工程师，然后才回去。我看到墙上贴着一张大照片，这个人便是苏联电焊女技工古德里亚夫切娃。她曾经爬到十几丈高的钢架上工作，以便亲自教会她的保加利亚的兄弟姊妹们。伊万克就是这样学会作焊工的。伊万克现在也逐渐成为熟练工人了，将来就要和其他成千的青年们，在这个自己修建的工厂里长久工作。
    伊万克的话使我回想起几天来参观保加利亚工业企业的经历：从索非亚的季米特洛夫机车修理工厂，到普罗夫迪夫城的科拉罗夫汽车修理厂，厂长和工人同志们在谈到他们的成就时，除了感谢保加利亚共产党的领导外，就是感谢伟大社会主义国家的无私的帮助。战时破坏了的索非亚机车修理厂，从一九四八年起不但恢复了战前的生产水平，并在苏联技术人员的帮助下，自己制造火车头，这是一件非同小可的事。它进一步激发了全厂、甚至全国工人的爱国主义生产热情。我知道该厂一位叫比得考夫的技工，由于他在某制造零件的机器上创设一个输送带，就给国家节省了六千二百万列瓦（合十二万四千美元）。在一九四九年，该厂又开始自造压路机；到今年我去参观的那天，正值全厂职工举行大会，庆祝制造第一架掘土机的成功。
    党委的同志告诉我：现在在季米特洛夫格勒从事建设的有四万人。“斯大林化学肥料厂”今年十月革命节时就可以建成了。它对于全国经济的影响，将是十分巨大的。据估计：在全国可耕地中，这个厂的生产量可以平均供给每狄克尔（约合中国一亩强）四到五公斤人造肥料。在十五年以内，季米特洛夫格勒城将有一系列的食品和其他工业出现。那时，以前只有千余人的三个小村，就变成一座十万人口的新的工业城市了！
    大家都这样说着：“这就是季米特洛夫格勒，我们对它的名字感到骄傲！”我留恋地走下这个大建筑物。在黄昏中，大厦的一个高塔尖上闪出了霓虹灯的光辉：“光荣归于斯大林！”
