    Shenyang Smelting Plant Completes Production Increase and Thrift Task Three Months Ahead of Schedule
    Chairman Gao Gang Sends Letter to Reward All Employees
    Shenyang Smelting Plant completed its production increase and thrift task three months ahead of schedule. The plant's employee representative assembly wrote a letter to Chairman Gao Gang of the Northeast People's Government to report the good news. Chairman Gao Gang sent a letter in reply to commend them. The original letter is as follows: To all employees of Shenyang Smelting Plant:
    You have completed the annual production increase and thrift task three months ahead of schedule. This is a significant contribution to the motherland. I hope you will work harder, infinitely unleash the creativity of the working class, and further explore the potential forces in production.
    With
    Respect,
    Gao Gang
    October 22nd
    To Chairman Gao Gang,
    From the Employee Representative Assembly of Shenyang Smelting Plant:
    Respected Chairman Gao Gang:
    In order to warmly respond to your call at the urban work conference to increase production and save 5 million tons of grain, all employees of our smelting plant, under the leadership of the trade union, signed a collective contract with the administration on August 18th, centered on completing the task of increasing production and saving 115,976 tons of grain for the entire year. In order to ensure the full completion of the collective contract tasks, all our employees, under the unified leadership of the Party, the administration, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League, formulated workshop and individual plans, revised the group's patriotic pact, and signed contact contracts. On the basis of the quality inspection campaign, we actively launched a plant-wide patriotic production increase and thrift production campaign. In the competition, all our employees worked actively and diligently, brought into play the working class's enthusiasm and creativity, and grasped the key to unlocking the potential of our plant—increasing the actual metal recovery rate. In August, we created 11 new records in major technical and economic norms; in September, we broke through the August achievements and created 13 new highest records. Therefore, by the end of September, we had victoriously overfulfilled the annual overall production increase and thrift task of 116,844 tons of grain (calculated according to the new calculation method issued by the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government, it is 146,141 tons of grain), completing 100.7 percent of the annual overall task. Among them, accelerating capital turnover completed 120 percent of the task; reducing costs completed 82.8 percent of the task; and improving equipment utilization efficiency and increasing output completed 92.53 percent of the task.
    Respected Chairman Gao Gang: The potential forces in the enterprise are very great, and the creativity of our working class is inexhaustible! Therefore, we are by no means satisfied with the little achievements we have obtained. In order to continue to unleash potential forces and overfulfill the production increase and thrift task even more, we held the third meeting of the third employee representative assembly on October 15th. Under the leadership of the Party, the administration, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League, after discussion and research by all the representatives, a unanimous resolution was made: to continue to exceed the production increase and thrift plan by 32,064 tons of grain in the fourth quarter, and to strive to complete 148,040 tons of grain for the whole year! We have full confidence in ensuring the complete realization of this glorious task!
    Wishing you good health,
    Respectfully,
    The Third Meeting of the Third Employee Representative Assembly of Shenyang Smelting Plant
    October 15th

    沈阳冶炼厂提前三个月完成增产节约任务
    高岗主席致函奖励全体职工
    沈阳冶炼厂提前三个月完成增产节约任务，该厂职工代表大会写信向东北人民政府高岗主席报捷，高岗主席特复信嘉勉。原信如下：沈阳冶炼厂全体职工：
    你们提前三个月完成全年增产节约的任务，这是对祖国重大的贡献，望你们更加努力，无限地发挥工人阶级的创造性，进一步发掘生产中的潜在力量。
    致以
    敬礼
    高    岗
    十月二十二日
    沈阳冶炼厂职工代表大会
    给高岗主席信敬爱的高岗主席：
    我们冶炼厂全体职工为了热烈响应你在城市工作会议上提出的增产节约五百万吨粮食的号召，在工会的领导下，于八月十八日与行政订立了以全年完成增产节约十一万五千九百七十六吨粮食任务为中心的集体合同。为了保证集体合同任务的全部完成，我们全体职工在党、行政、工会、青年团的统一领导下，制订了车间、个人计划，修订了小组爱国公约，订立了联系合同，在质量大检查运动的基础上，积极地展开了全厂性的爱国主义增产节约生产大竞赛。在竞赛中我们全体职工都积极努力，发挥了工人阶级的积极性、创造性，抓住了我厂挖掘潜力的关键——提高金属实收率，八月份在主要技术经济定额中，创造了十一项新纪录；九月份更突破八月份成绩，创造了十三项的最高新纪录。因此，在九月底我们已胜利地超额完成了全年总的增产节约任务十一万六千八百四十四吨粮食（如按东北人民政府工业部新颁之计算方法计算，为十四万六千一百四十一吨粮食），完成全年总任务的百分之一百点七。其中加速资金周转方面完成任务百分之一二○；降低成本方面完成任务的百分之八二点八，提高设备运用效率、增加产量方面完成任务的百分之九二点五三。
    敬爱的高岗主席：企业中的潜在力量是很大的，我们工人阶级的创造力是无穷尽的！因此，我们绝不满足于已获得的一点点成就。为了继续发挥潜在力量，更多的超额完成增产节约任务，我们在十月十五日举行了第三届第三次职工代表大会，在党、行政、工会、青年团的领导下，经全体代表讨论研究后，一致决议：在第四季中继续超过增产节约计划三万二千零六十四吨粮食，全年为完成十四万八千零四十吨粮食而奋斗！我们完全有信心来保证这一光荣任务的全部实现！
    敬祝您身体健康
    沈阳冶炼厂第三届第三次职工代表大会敬上
    十月十五日
