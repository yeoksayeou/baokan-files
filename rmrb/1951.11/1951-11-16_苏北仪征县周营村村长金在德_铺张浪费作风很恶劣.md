To the Editor:
Jin Zaide, the village head of Zhouying Village, Yongqing Township, Xinmin District, Yizheng County, Subei, extravagantly celebrated his wife's 30th birthday on October 18, collecting a lot of "gifts." Many people from this village and neighboring villages gave "contributions," ranging from 8,000, 10,000, to 20,000 or 30,000 yuan per "contribution." On the 18th, firecrackers were set off at his house, making it very lively. Before the birthday celebration, his family used wheat seeds to exchange for a fat pig from the landlord Zhao Changliu's family (nominally exchanging wheat seeds for a fat pig; it's unknown if it was actually an exchange), preparing to slaughter it to treat guests. On this day, the landlord also participated, swaggering and eating and drinking, as imposing as in the past.

Now is the time for increasing production and practicing economy, and Jin Zaide's extravagant and wasteful behavior is very wrong. The masses have also expressed great dissatisfaction with Jin Zaide's behavior. When Zhang Changwan from the Yizheng County Cooperative Union working group came to the village to mobilize the masses to buy shares, the masses said, "We have to give gifts to the village head, otherwise we can't get by, but it doesn't matter if we don't buy shares in the cooperative." This has hindered the development of the cooperative's business. Therefore, we suggest that the leaders of Xinmin District, Yizheng County, should properly handle this matter and prevent similar phenomena from occurring.

　　苏北仪征县周营村村长金在德
    铺张浪费作风很恶劣
    编辑同志：苏北仪征县新民区永庆乡周营村村长金在德，在十月十八日给他的老婆做三十岁的寿庆，大收“人情”。本村及邻村的很多人都出了“份子”。每个“份子”八千、一万、二万、三万元不等。十八日这天，他家鞭炮不绝，热闹非常。做寿之前，他家用麦种换了地主赵长六家的一口肥猪（名义上是用麦种换的肥猪，不知到底是不是换的），准备宰杀请客。这天，地主也参加了，他们大摇大摆，吃酒吃肉，和往日一样威风。
    现在正当增产节约的时候，金在德这种铺张浪费的行为是十分错误的。群众对金在德的行为也表示极大不满。该县合作社联合社工作组张长万到该村动员群众入股时，群众说：“村长人情不出不得过，合作社的股子不出不要紧。”这样，就使合作社业务的发展受到了阻碍。因此，我们建议仪征县新民区领导方面应对此事进行适当处理，并防止类似现象的发生。
