To the Editor:

The Taiyuan Railway Sub-bureau of the Tianjin Railway Administration has, from last year until now, allocated vehicles without following plans. This has caused the South Yard (station) of the Third Mine of the Yangquan Mining Bureau to be filled with stored coal, making it impossible to unload any more. For example, in January of this year, the yard had over 54,000 tons of stored coal, and there was no more space to store it. They had no choice but to dump the coal at the Dasaiyu coal yard. This coal needs to be transported back to the station by horse-drawn carts. Over 30,000 tons of coal were dumped at the Dasaiyu coal yard. Transporting this coal requires more than 300,000 jin of millet in transportation fees and will take more than five months to complete. The fluctuating number of vehicles allocated directly affects the health of the loading workers. For example, on May 13th, they loaded 64 cars, totaling 2,005 tons of coal. Because of working day and night, most workers fell ill due to over-fatigue. According to statistics, the number of sick loading workers from May to June reached over 23%. Regarding this situation, we have repeatedly suggested to the Saiyu Station of the Taiyuan Sub-bureau that they reasonably allocate vehicles according to the plan, but the situation has not changed to this day. For example, on October 22nd, they loaded 48 cars, totaling 1,465 tons of coal, averaging 15 tons per person per day, exceeding our mine's highest loading record by 7 tons. At the same time, there were four days in October with no vehicles, causing the workers to have no wage income during these days. Based on the above situation, we hope that the leaders of the bureau can quickly achieve reasonable allocation of vehicles according to the plan and publicly respond in the newspaper.

    太原铁路分局调配车辆无计划
    使阳泉煤矿运煤遭受损失
    编辑同志：天津铁路管理局太原分局，由去年到现在，调配车辆一直不按计划，致使阳泉矿务局第三矿南场（车站）存煤积满，无法再卸。比如，今年一月份场内存煤达五万四千多吨，再没地方存放了，就只好把煤倒在大赛鱼煤场，这些煤需要再用马车往车站拉运。倒在大赛鱼煤场的煤有三万多吨。运完这些煤需要三十余万斤小米的运费，并且需时五个多月才能运完。由于调配车辆的数量不定，直接影响到装车工人的身体健康。比如五月十三日那天装了六十四个车共二千零五吨的煤。因为昼夜不息地工作，大部工人因疲劳过度而害病。据统计，五月份至六月份装车工人中生病的竟达到百分之二十三以上。对于这种情况，我们曾屡次向太原分局赛鱼车站建议，请他们按照计划合理调配车辆，但至今情况仍未改变。如十月二十二日装了四十八辆车共一千四百六十五吨煤，平均每人每天要装十五吨，超过我矿装车最高纪录七吨。同时，十月份中就有四天没车，使工人在这几天内没有工资收入。根据以上情况，我们希望该局领导方面能够尽快地做到按计划合理调配车辆，并在报纸上公开答复。
