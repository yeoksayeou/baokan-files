Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 12th: The Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party held its Fourth Plenary Session from November 1st to 4th.

　　The meeting heard a report from Kim Il Sung, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party.

　　In his report, Kim Il Sung said: Since our country gained liberation from Japanese imperialism, our party has achieved tremendous accomplishments in the struggle to win freedom, happiness, unification, and independence for the Korean people. In this struggle, the Workers' Party has become the leading force and the force of unified will for all the Korean people. All the Korean people believe that our party's policies are their own policies. In the struggle against the American armed aggressors, although the party has suffered enormous sacrifices and losses, it has maintained contact with the broad masses of the people, learned lessons in the struggle, and overcome all difficulties.

　　Kim Il Sung continued: The reason why our party has been able to achieve victory in the past is because all of our party's activities are based on the most advanced and revolutionary theory of Marxism-Leninism. He pointed out: The party must combine the ideas and methods of Marxism-Leninism with the reality of our Korea and put them into practice. Our party should further consolidate the party's core and expand and deepen the party's ties with the broad masses.

　　Kim Il Sung said: In order to systematically further strengthen the party's ranks in recent months, the party has carried out the work of re-registering party members and reorganizing the organization in areas that had been occupied by the American invading army and have now been re-liberated. In a short period of time, the party has basically recovered in terms of quantity. However, in the process of reorganizing the organization, some of the party's leading personnel still have many shortcomings that must be corrected in developing the party's work in terms of quality. After pointing out some shortcomings in organizational issues and united front issues that exist in some party organizations, Kim Il Sung analyzed the causes of the shortcomings and put forward ways to correct them. He called on the entire party to work hard to correct these shortcomings and demanded that party organizations at all levels conduct inspection work in a planned and systematic manner.

　　After discussing Kim Il Sung's report, the meeting passed corresponding resolutions.

　　The meeting also discussed organizational matters. The meeting approved the removal of Xu Jiayi from his original position as Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party because he had been appointed as Vice Premier of the Cabinet of the Republic. The meeting also elected Park Jung-ae, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party, as a member of the Political Committee of the Central Committee of the Party; and elected Park Chang-ok as Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party.

　　朝鲜劳动党中央委员会
    举行第四届全体会议
    金日成报告党在斗争中的成就
    【新华社平壤十二日电】朝鲜劳动党中央委员会在十一月一日至四日举行第四次全体会议。
    会议听取了劳动党中央委员会委员长金日成的报告。
    金日成在报告中说：自我国从日本帝国主义统治下获得解放以来，我党在争取朝鲜人民的自由幸福和统一独立的斗争中，已经取得了巨大的成就。在这种斗争中，劳动党成了全朝鲜人民的领导力量和统一意志的力量。全朝鲜人民认为我党的政策就是人民自己的政策。在反对美国武装侵略者的斗争中，党虽然遭到了巨大的牺牲和损失，但是，保持了与广大的人民群众的联系，并在斗争中取得了教训，战胜了一切困难。
    金日成接着说：我党在过去所以能够取得胜利，是因为我党的全部活动，是依据最先进的、革命的马克思列宁主义的理论。他指出：党必须把马克思列宁主义的思想和方法与我们朝鲜的现实结合起来，加以实践。我党应该进一步巩固党的核心，扩大和密切党与广大群众的联系。
    金日成说：党在最近的几个月中，为了有组织地进一步加强党的队伍，在被美国侵略军占领过、现在已重获解放的地区，进行了党员重新登记的工作和整理组织的工作。在短期中，党在数量上已基本上恢复。但是，在整理组织的过程中，党的一部分领导人员在从质量上发展党的工作中，还有着许多必须加以纠正的缺点。金日成在指出了一部分党的组织在组织问题上和统一战线问题上所存在的一些缺点之后，分析了产生缺点的原因，并提出了纠正缺点的办法。他号召全党努力纠正这些缺点，并要求各级党的组织有计划、有系统地进行检查工作。
    会议在讨论了金日成的报告后，通过了相应的决议。
    会议并讨论了组织问题。会议通过免除许嘉谊原任党中央委员会书记之职，因为他已经被任命为共和国内阁副首相，会议还补选党中央委员会书记朴正爱为党中央委员会的政治委员；选举朴昌玉为党中央委员会书记。
