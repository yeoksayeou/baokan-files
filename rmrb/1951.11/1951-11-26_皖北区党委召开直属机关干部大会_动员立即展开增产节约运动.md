    Northern Anhui Regional Party Committee Convenes Meeting of Directly Subordinate Organ Cadres to Mobilize Immediate Launch of Production Increase and Economy Practice Campaign
    The Northern Anhui Regional Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of cadres from directly subordinate organs on the 12th of this month. Comrade Niu Shucai, Secretary of the Regional Committee, delivered a report, mobilizing the launch of a production increase and economy practice campaign. Comrade Niu Shucai pointed out: Increasing production and practicing strict economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers is Chairman Mao's call and the central task of the Chinese people today. At present, the production increase and economy practice campaign has been launched successively throughout the country, and Northern Anhui should take immediate action. Comrade Niu Shucai recounted the achievements that Northern Anhui had made in carrying out the production increase and economy practice campaign in the past. For example, the Huainan Coal Mine promoted new coal mining methods and adjusted the labor organization, which greatly improved production quality and greatly reduced costs. The Bengbu Post and Telecommunications Administration's long-distance telephone center station implemented a line responsibility system. In the first month of participating in the national three major trunk line competition, the average number of line failures per hundred kilometers was only 0.52 times, with a time of one minute and thirty seconds, winning first place in the country. However, Comrade Niu Shucai pointed out that a wasteful style is growing in some agencies. After listing many facts of extravagance and waste, Comrade Niu Shucai explained that this is a manifestation of the landlord and bourgeois decadent and extravagant thoughts invading our organs, so this bad ideology and bad style must be overcome. Otherwise, we will not be able to lead the masses forward and carry out large-scale construction.
    Comrade Niu Shucai emphasized that the focus of the production increase and economy practice campaign should be on business and enterprise departments. It is estimated that the factories directly under the Industrial Department of the Northern Anhui Administrative Office can increase the country's wealth by more than 20 billion yuan within one year after carrying out the production increase and economy practice campaign. In addition, the management and use of various operating expenses, the planning and design of capital construction, and the turnover and allocation of funds are even more related to increasing production and practicing economy. If these are done well, a large amount of funds can be saved for the country. Comrade Niu Shucai called on the entire region to launch a struggle against waste and corruption, encourage those who make rationalization proposals for the production increase and economy practice campaign, and protect those who expose and criticize waste and corruption incidents; to make the production increase and economy practice campaign a mass movement.
    Finally, Comrade Niu Shucai instructed all directly subordinate organs to first carry out the study of relevant documents on increasing production and practicing economy within their own units, conduct work inspections, carry out criticism and self-criticism, formulate implementation plans for increasing production and practicing economy, and strictly prohibit all wasteful phenomena. So that increasing production and practicing economy will first create a craze in directly subordinate organs, and then gradually make it a mass movement.

    皖北区党委召开直属机关干部大会
    动员立即展开增产节约运动
    中共皖北区委员会在本月十二日召开直属机关干部大会，由区委员会书记牛树才同志作报告，动员开展增产节约运动。牛树才同志指出：增加生产、厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军，是毛主席的号召，是中国人民今天的中心任务。目前增产节约运动已在全国各地陆续开展，皖北应立即行动起来。牛树才同志历述了过去皖北在开展增产节约运动中所获得的成绩。如淮南煤矿推广了新采煤法，调整了劳动组织，生产质量大大提高，成本大为降低。蚌埠邮电管理局长途电话中心站推行了包线专责制，在参加全国三大干线竞赛的第一个月中，每百公里平均只发生线路故障零点五二次，时间为一分三十秒，获得全国第一。但是，牛树才同志指出，目前在某些机关中正滋长着铺张浪费的作风。牛树才同志在列举了许多铺张浪费的事实后，说明这是地主、资产阶级的奢侈浮华思想侵入到我们机关内部的表现，因此必须克服这种坏思想和坏作风。否则我们就不能领导人民群众前进，进行大规模的建设事业。
    牛树才同志着重指出：增产节约运动的重点应是事业和企业部门。皖北行署工业处直属各工厂在开展增产节约运动后，估计一年内可以为国家增加财富二百余亿元。此外，各种事业经费的管理与使用，基本建设的计划与设计，资金的周转与调度，与增产节约的关系更大。这些搞得好，可以为国家节省大量资金。牛树才同志号召全区要开展反浪费反贪污斗争，鼓励对增产节约运动的合理化建议者，保护对浪费贪污事件的揭发者和批评者；使增产节约运动成为群众性的运动。
    牛树才同志最后指示各直属机关，首先要在本单位内展开对有关增产节约文件的学习，并进行工作检查，开展批评与自我批评，订出增产节约的实施方案，严禁一切浪费现象。使增产节约先在直属机关内造成热潮，然后有步骤地使其成为群众性的运动。（根据十一月十七日皖北日报材料改编）
