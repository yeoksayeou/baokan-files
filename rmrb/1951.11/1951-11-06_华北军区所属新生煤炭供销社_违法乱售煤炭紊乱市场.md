    New Coal Supply and Marketing Cooperative Affiliated to North China Military Region
    Illegally Sells Coal, Disrupting the Market
    Comrade Editor: The New Coal Supply and Marketing Cooperative affiliated to the North China Military Region, in violation of the instructions of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, is illegally selling coal and disrupting the market, undermining national financial and economic policies.
    When the Financial and Economic Committee allowed the establishment of the New Coal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, it stipulated the principles of supply and marketing, prohibiting the cooperative from engaging in commercial transactions with ordinary citizens. However, the cooperative has repeatedly violated these regulations, illegally selling coal. Although our company has repeatedly inquired, the cooperative has ignored us. According to incomplete statistics, in addition to supplying raw materials needed by its own units, the cooperative illegally sold as much as 5,000 tons of coal to other public and private enterprises between January and May of this year. After our company inquired again, the cooperative finally made a self-criticism on the matter. However, up to now, there has been no actual rectification of the cooperative's illegal behavior. On October 13th, our company received a report from the Shanghai Coal Company stating: "Recently, a large number of Yangquan coal trucks arrived in Shanghai, including more than 800 tons transported by a certain division's production unit on the 6th, 7th, and 8th of October, which were sold at high prices to all buyers regardless of their background, creating a black market and causing market price chaos." According to our investigation, this batch of Yangquan coal was indeed sold to a certain division by the Beijing New Coal Supply and Marketing Cooperative. Furthermore, according to reports from our Beijing Coal Company, after the cooperative's self-criticism, it exceeded the principles of supply and marketing in the months of August, September, and October, selling more than 21,000 tons of coal.
    The New Coal Supply and Marketing Cooperative disregards the law and has consistently engaged in speculative behavior, fueling price fluctuations and increasing the difficulties of state-owned trade. This cannot be allowed and should be appropriately dealt with.

    华北军区所属新生煤炭供销社
    违法乱售煤炭紊乱市场
    编辑同志：华北军区所属之新生煤炭供销社，违反政务院财政经济委员会的指示，乱售煤斤，紊乱市场，破坏了国家财经政策。
    在财政经济委员会允许新生煤炭供销社成立时，就规定了供销原则，不准该社与一般市民进行商业交易。但该社屡次违反规定，乱售煤斤。我公司虽屡有函询，该社却一概不理。据不完全统计，该社除供给本机关单位之原料需用外，在今年一月至五月间曾违法卖给其他公、私营企业煤炭达五千吨。经本公司再次函询，该社才对此事作了检讨。但至目前为止，该社违法行为实际仍无丝毫改正。十月十三日本公司接到上海煤业公司的报告说：“最近有大批阳泉煤车到沪，其中某师生产股于十月六、七、八三日内，即运到八百余吨，不分对象，以高价出售。造成黑市，引起市场价格混乱。”据我们调查，此批阳泉煤确系北京新生煤炭供销社售与某师的。又据我北京煤业公司反映：在该社检讨以后，八、九、十三个月内又超越供销原则，售出煤炭两万一千余吨。
    新生煤炭供销社漠视法令，一贯进行投机行为，助长了物价波动，增加了国营贸易的困难，这是不能允许的，应作适当的处理。
