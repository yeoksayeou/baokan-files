　　Farmers in Zhongdi District, Kangle County, Gansu Province
    Practice Patriotic Pledges and Pay Patriotic Public Grain
    After the Resist America, Aid Korea, and Suppress Counter-Revolutionary movements, the political consciousness of the farmers in Zhongdi District, Kangle County, Gansu Province, has been greatly enhanced. In their patriotic pledges, they universally included the clause "Pay public grain early and pay good public grain." In order to fully realize their patriotic pledges, farmers in various townships and villages began preparations for grain payment on September 16th. Farmers in the fourth and fifth townships also implemented a detailed division of labor based on local conditions. It was stipulated that women would be responsible for inspecting the quality of the grain, and the farmers' association and militia would help with transportation. In addition, townships challenged each other to ensure "early and good public grain payment," and to practice their patriotic pledges one hundred percent. On the first day of the levy, farmers from the first, second, and third administrative villages of the third township, under the leadership of Township Head Zhang Youxiang and others, spontaneously organized a transportation team of more than 300 people to collectively pay their patriotic public grain. The grain carts were filled with flags bearing the words "Resist America, Aid Korea, and Pay Patriotic Public Grain." A Yangko team composed of more than 50 young men, women, and children danced Yangko along the way, sang songs, and shouted loud slogans of Resisting America and Aiding Korea. Farmers from the fifth and sixth townships delivered public grain through the mud after the rain. Farmer Yan Zicheng said, "In order to practice our patriotic pledges and support the People's Volunteer Army, we cannot lag behind in grain payment even if it rains." At present, the farmers' enthusiasm is extremely high, and the movement to pay patriotic public grain is still developing vigorously. Sun Yuxian

　　甘肃省康乐县中砥区农民
    实践爱国公约缴纳爱国公粮
    甘肃省康乐县中砥区农民，经过抗美援朝、镇压反革命运动后，政治觉悟已大大提高。他们在爱国公约上，普遍订立了“早缴公粮，缴好公粮”一条。为了全部实现自己的爱国公约，各乡、村农民即于九月十六日开始缴粮准备工作。四、五两乡的农民还依据当地的具体情况，实行了详细的分工。规定：由妇女负责检验粮食的品质，农会和民兵帮助运送。另外，乡与乡之间相互挑战，保证“早缴和缴好公粮”，百分之百地实践爱国公约。开征的第一天，三乡一、二、三行政村的农民，在乡长张有祥等的领导下，自动组织了三百余人的运输大队，集体缴纳爱国公粮。运粮的车上，插满了“抗美援朝、缴纳爱国公粮”的旗帜，五十余男女青年、儿童组成的秧歌队，沿途扭着秧歌、唱着歌子、高呼抗美援朝的响亮口号。五、六两乡的农民，踏着雨后的泥泞送交公粮。农民阎自成说：“为了实践爱国公约，支援人民志愿军，就是下雨，缴粮也不能落后。”目前，农民情绪异常高昂，缴纳爱国公粮的运动还在蓬勃地开展着。　孙愈先
