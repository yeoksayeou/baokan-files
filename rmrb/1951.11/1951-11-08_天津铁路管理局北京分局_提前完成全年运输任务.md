    Tianjin Railway Administration Beijing Branch
    Completes Annual Transportation Task Ahead of Schedule
    To the Editor: Under the correct leadership of higher authorities, all employees of the Beijing Branch of the Tianjin Railway Administration completed the annual transportation task seventy days ahead of schedule on October 22nd. The number of loaded wagons is equivalent to 108% of the actual number of loaded wagons for the entire year last year. The number of accidents within ten months has also decreased by 261 compared to the same period last year. This is concrete proof of the significant improvement in transportation efficiency in our bureau over the past year. The reason why our bureau was able to achieve such results is mainly because of the patriotic red flag emulation campaign to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. Many labor models played an active leading role in the competition. For example, the twenty-four rationalization proposals put forward by labor models of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot at a symposium have now had thirteen completed. Six maintenance of way districts in our bureau have implemented the Nefedov method of track maintenance, and advanced work methods such as the soft water method have been generally implemented in various locomotive depots. These are important factors that enabled our bureau to complete the transportation task ahead of schedule.

    Chairman Mao called on the people of the whole country to increase production and practice strict economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. In order to respond to this call, all employees of our bureau have decided to continue their efforts and strive to complete 125% of the annual transportation task by the end of the year.

    Note:
    ?Nefedov was the track maintenance foreman of the Kharkov Engineering Section of the Southern Railway of the Soviet Union. His track maintenance method is to strengthen joints, lock rails, prevent track diseases in advance, and rationally use labor. He pays attention to saving everywhere, utilizing waste materials, and requires compliance with the principles of economic accounting, while also ensuring quality and eliminating accidents.
    ?The soft water method is a method of softening water quality. This can reduce water hardness, save locomotive coal, and extend the mileage between washing and inspections.

### 天津铁路管理局北京分局  提前完成全年运输任务

    天津铁路管理局北京分局
    提前完成全年运输任务
    编辑同志：天津铁路管理局北京分局全体职工在上级的正确领导下，已于十月二十二日提前七十天完成了全年的运输任务。装车数相当于去年全年实际装车数的百分之一百零八。十个月内的事故也较去年同时期减少了二百六十一件。这是我局一年来运输效率显著提高的具体证明。我局所以能获得这样成绩，主要是因为开展了抗美援朝爱国主义红旗竞赛，许多劳动模范在竞赛中发挥了积极的带头作用。比如丰台机务段劳动模范们在一个座谈会上所提出的二十四件合理化建议，现在已经完成了十三件。我局养路工区已有六个工区实行了聂菲铎夫养路法?各机务段并普遍实行了软水法?等先进工作方法。这就是我局能提前完成运输任务的重要因素。
    毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议上，号召全国人民增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军。为了响应这个号召，我局全体职工决定继续努力，至年底争取完成全年运输任务的百分之一百二十五。

    注：
    ?聂菲铎夫是苏联南方铁路哈尔克夫工务段的养路工长。他的养路办法，就是加强接头，锁定钢轨，事先预防轨道病害，合理地使用劳动力。他处处注意节约，利用废物，要求合乎经济核算制的原则，同时还要保证质量，消灭事故。
    ?软水法是软化水质的工作法。这样可以降低水质硬度，节省机煤和延长洗检公里。
