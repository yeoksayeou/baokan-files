In order to improve the quality of translation work, and enable translators across the country to carry out their work in a planned and organized manner according to the needs of national construction, the Central People's Government General Administration of Publications convened the first National Translation Work Conference from the 5th to the 12th of this month.

The meeting was presided over by Hu Yuzhi, Director of the Central People's Government General Administration of Publications. At the opening of the meeting, Ma Xulun, Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council, Zeng Zhaolun, Deputy Minister of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Education, Tao Menghe, Deputy Dean of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and social scientist Li Da attended and delivered speeches. Hu Qiaomu, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Shen Zhiyuan, Director of the Compilation and Translation Bureau of the Central People's Government General Administration of Publications, made two special reports on translation work at the meeting.

In his report, Deputy Director Hu Qiaomu explained that in order to meet the needs of today's national construction, translation work must be strengthened and expanded, its quality must be improved, and necessary work plans and work systems must be formulated. In his report, Director Shen Zhiyuan put forward seven tasks for future translation work: (1) formulating a national translation plan; (2) establishing necessary work systems; (3) gradually establishing specialized work organizations; (4) launching criticism and self-criticism in the translation community; (5) unifying translated names and compiling dictionaries for various subjects; (6) studying and sorting out translation experience; (7) training specialized translation cadres.

The representatives attending the meeting unanimously agreed with the reports of Deputy Director Hu Qiaomu and Director Shen Zhiyuan. Regarding the issue of planned translation work, the meeting believed that in the current situation, the government must estimate the existing manpower, objective needs, and publishing conditions, and formulate preliminary plans, listing the books in various subjects that urgently need translation in the coming year. The meeting revised the draft of the "1952 National Translation Topic Selection Plan" proposed by the General Administration of Publications, and also discussed specific methods for implementing the plan.

Regarding improving the quality of translation, the meeting believed that this should start with organized work institutions. On the one hand, the review and correction work of state-owned publishing houses before publishing translated manuscripts should be strengthened, and on the other hand, the review and correction system for translated manuscripts of various compilation and translation institutions should be strengthened. The meeting passed the "Draft Regulations of the General Administration of Publications of the Central People's Government on the Publication of Translated Books by State-Owned Publishing Houses" and the "Draft Regulations on the Translation Work of Compilation and Translation Institutions of Organs and Groups," which the General Administration of Publications will submit to the Government Administration Council for approval and implementation.

    出版总署召开第一届全国翻译工作会议
    为了提高翻译工作质量，使全国翻译工作者能按国家建设的需要有计划、有组织地进行工作，中央人民政府出版总署在本月五日至十二日召开了第一届全国翻译工作会议。
    会议由中央人民政府出版总署胡愈之署长主持。会议开幕时，中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会马叙伦副主任、中央人民政府教育部曾昭抡副部长、中国科学院陶孟和副院长和社会科学家李达等曾到会讲话。中共中央宣传部胡乔木副部长和中央人民政府出版总署编译局沈志远局长在会上作了有关翻译工作的两个专题报告。
    胡乔木副部长在他的报告中说明：为了适应今天国家建设的需要，翻译工作必须加强和扩大，必须提高质量，并制定必要的工作计划和工作制度。沈志远局长在他的报告中提出了今后翻译工作的七项任务：（一）制定全国翻译计划；（二）确立必需的工作制度；（三）逐步建立专门性的工作组织；（四）展开翻译界的批评和自我批评；（五）统一译名和编纂各科辞典；（六）研究和整理翻译经验；（七）培养专门的翻译干部。
    参加会议的代表一致同意胡乔木副部长和沈志远局长的报告。关于翻译工作计划化的问题，会议认为就目前情况言，政府必须估计现有的人力、客观的需要以及出版的条件，订出初步的计划，将明年度各科急需翻译的书籍列入。会议修订了出版总署所提出的“一九五二年全国翻译选题计划”草案，还讨论了实现计划的具体办法。
    关于提高翻译质量，会议认为应先从有组织的工作机构入手，一方面应加强公营出版社在出版翻译稿件之前的审校工作，一方面应加强各编译机构翻译稿件的审校制度。会议通过了“中央人民政府出版总署关于公营出版社出版翻译书籍的规定草案”和“关于机关团体编译机构翻译工作的规定草案”，由出版总署提请政务院批准实施。（新华社）
