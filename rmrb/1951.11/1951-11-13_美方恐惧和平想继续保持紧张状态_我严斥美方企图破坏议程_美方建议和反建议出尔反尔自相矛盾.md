Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 12th: At the Sub-Committee meeting of the Korean Armistice Negotiations on the 12th, our representative continued to refute the other side's rejection of the immediate determination of the military demarcation line and demilitarized zone, and their attempt to overturn the second item on the agenda. Our representative pointed out that the other side insisted on postponing the task of determining the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone to the so-called armistice agreement signing time, which cannot be predetermined, with the aim of simply facilitating the indefinite delay of the specific determination of the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone when the other side cannot obtain unilaterally advantageous demands. The U.S. representative, on the one hand, clamored for so-called military pressure on the armistice negotiations, and on the other hand, expressed deep fear that once the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone were determined, our side would publicize it, affecting its military adventure plans. Our representative pointed out that the other side's so-called military pressure cannot threaten anyone, and it is precisely the U.S. side that is trying to escape the threat of peaceful pressure. On this issue, the different attitudes of both sides towards war and peace are sharply manifested. Our representative once again solemnly stated that the other side's absurd proposal on November 10, aimed at overturning the second item on the agenda, is completely unacceptable. Only our proposal is the only fair and reasonable answer to resolving the second item on the agenda.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 12th: This agency's special correspondent reports: While Acheson was in the United Nations General Assembly in Paris, talking glibly about a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the U.S. negotiating representatives in Panmunjom were singing a different tune at the conference table.

The U.S. representative shamelessly said in the Sub-Committee that they did not want to determine the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone because it was a "de facto ceasefire." But they did not reveal their inner fear—even the fear of the shadow of peace. They are afraid that once the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone are determined, although it can still be changed before the final signing of the armistice agreement, their soldiers and allied soldiers will no longer obediently bleed and sacrifice for further military attempts to change the battle line.

Observers here believe that the U.S. suggestions and counter-suggestions, as well as the contradictory arguments they put forward at the conference table, are to achieve two goals: to demand Kaesong at the conference table; or to refuse to determine the military demarcation line, thereby undermining the agenda and indefinitely delaying negotiations.

The Sub-Committee meetings since October 25th have further proved to the world that one side hopes for rapid progress in the negotiations and an early armistice. For more than two weeks, the U.S. representatives have been obstructing the achievement of an agreement on the second item of the agenda, while the Korean and Chinese representatives have continuously eliminated the excuses of the U.S. side obstructing the rapid agreement on the military demarcation line.

On October 25th, the U.S. representatives used various excuses to include Kaesong into the U.S. position, in order to delineate the military demarcation line and demilitarized zone in this way. The U.S. representatives also said that if the negotiations progressed rapidly, it would be inconvenient to take into account the daily changes in the battle line. After their attempt to demand Kaesong failed, on November 5th, they reversed their original argument, saying that it was inconvenient to determine the military demarcation line now, and that only an agreement on the second item of the agenda could be reached in principle. They attempted to undermine the agenda procedure agreed upon by both parties after the tenth meeting of the Korean Armistice Negotiations on July 26th.

In the past few days, they have put forward two methods: to obtain Kaesong in the name of "adjustment," or not to determine the military demarcation line now. This threat did not take effect. They also found that their unreasonable demands for Kaesong had discredited them in the eyes of the world. But they still want to undermine the agenda and refuse to implement the provisions of the second item of the agenda, which clearly states: "As a basic condition for the cessation of hostilities in Korea, determine the military demarcation line between the two sides to establish a demilitarized zone."

The U.S. representative's lack of sincerity for a fair and reasonable armistice agreement can also be seen from the following fact: The U.S. representative advocated in July and August to immediately determine the military demarcation line. At that time, they took out a map showing the buffer zone. On that map, they cut off more than 12,000 square kilometers of land from the North Korean position. They argued at that time that the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone should be determined before the signing of the armistice agreement.

The U.S. propaganda and distortions cannot conceal the fact that although the U.S. side has had to admit the correctness of the principle of on-the-spot ceasefire proposed by our side, it opposes the specific determination of the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone based on this correct principle, attempting to overturn the clear provisions in the agenda in this way, so as to hinder the rapid agreement on the second item of the agenda. As long as the U.S. representative does not undermine the agenda procedure, the plenary session can proceed to discuss the other items on the agenda, and the Sub-Committee can also engage in the work of delineating the demilitarized zone. Everyone understands that the U.S. representative deliberately delays the achievement of an agreement on the most important item on the agenda—the ceasefire line issue—so that other items on the agenda cannot be agreed upon, and the tense situation is maintained.

　　美方恐惧和平想继续保持紧张状态
    我严斥美方企图破坏议程
    美方建议和反建议出尔反尔自相矛盾
    【新华社开城十二日电】十二日的朝鲜停战谈判小组委员会上，我方代表继续驳斥对方拒绝现在确定军事分界线和非军事区，企图推翻第二项议程的主张。我方代表指出，对方坚持将确定军事分界线和非军事区的任务推延到事先无从预定的所谓停战协议签字的时候，其目的只是为了便于在对方不能取得片面有利的要求时，无限期地拖延具体确定军事分界线和非军事区。美方代表一方面叫嚣将对停战谈判施行所谓军事压力，另一方面又表示深恐军事分界线和非军事区一旦确定后，我方将予以公开宣传，影响其军事冒险计划。我方代表指出：对方的所谓军事压力不能威胁任何人，而正是美方自己在企图逃脱和平压力的威胁。在这一问题上，尖锐地表现了双方对于战争与和平的不同态度。我方代表再次郑重表示对方十一月十日以推翻第二项议程为目的的荒谬建议，是完全不能考虑的。只有我方的建议，才是解决第二项议程唯一公平合理的答案。
    【新华社开城十二日电】本社特派记者报道：当艾奇逊在巴黎联合国大会侈谈和平解决朝鲜问题时，板门店美方谈判代表在会议桌上唱的是另一个调子。
    美方代表在小组委员会上无耻地说，他们不想确定军事分界线和非军事区，因为这是“事实上的停火”。但他们并未透露他们内心的恐惧——甚至对和平影子的恐惧。他们害怕：一旦军事分界线和非军事区确定后，尽管在最后签订停战协定前仍可予以变更，他们的士兵和盟国士兵将不再驯顺地为在军事上进一步试图改变战线而流血牺牲。
    此间观察家认为，美方的建议和反建议，以及他们在会议桌上提出的自相矛盾的论据，是为了达到两个目的：在会议桌上索取开城；或拒绝确定军事分界线，从而破坏议程，无限期地拖延谈判。
    自十月二十五日开始以来的小组委员会会议，已进一步向世界证明，那一方面希望谈判迅速进展并获得早日停战。两周多以来，美方代表一直在阻挠就议程第二项获致协议，而朝中代表却接连不断地消除美方阻挠迅速对军事分界线获致协议的藉口。
    十月二十五日，美方代表曾用各种藉口来把开城划入美方阵地内，这样来划定军事分界线和非军事区。美方代表并且还说，假如谈判进展迅速的话，把战线每天的变化考虑在内是不方便的。当他们这种索取开城的企图失败后，十一月五日，他们就一反他们原来的论据，他们说：现在确定军事分界线是不方便的，只能在原则上就议程第二项获致协议。他们企图破坏七月二十六日朝鲜停战谈判第十次会议后双方所同意的议程程序。
    在过去几天中，他们提出了两个办法：以“调整”之名取得开城，或者现在不确定军事分界线。这个威胁没有生效。他们并且发现，他们对开城的无理要求已使他们在世人面前名誉扫地。但是他们仍想要破坏议程，拒绝执行议程第二项的规定，这一项明白地说：“作为在朝鲜停止敌对行为的基本条件，确定双方军事分界线，以建立非军事地区。”
    美方代表对于一个公正的和合理的停战协定之没有诚意也可以从下列事实中看出：美方代表在七、八月间曾主张立即确定军事分界线，当时他们拿出一张表明缓冲区的地图，在那张地图上，他们从北朝鲜的阵地割去一万二千余平方公里的土地。他们当时主张在签订停战协定之前确定军事分界线与非军事区。
    美方的宣传与歪曲报道都不能掩饰这个事实：美方虽然不得不承认我方提出的就地停战原则的正确性，但是反对根据这一正确原则即行具体确定军事分界线与非军事区，企图这样来推翻议程中的明确规定，以阻挠就议程第二项迅速获致协议。只要美方代表不破坏议程的程序，全体会议便可以进而讨论议程的其他项目，同时小组委员会也可以从事划定非军事区的工作。大家都很明白：美方代表故意拖延议程上最重要的项目——停火线问题——的获致协议，从而使议程上其他项目也不能获致协议，继续保持紧张状态。
