　　Promote the Experience of the North China County Magistrate Conference

　　In September of this year, under the leadership of the State Council of the Central People's Government, the North China Affairs Department of the Central People's Government convened a North China County Magistrate Conference. This meeting was very successful, and all of its resolutions have been approved and promulgated by the State Council. The North China region is currently implementing them.

　　The central topic of the North China County Magistrate Conference was to discuss "further strengthening the work of county-level People's Representative Conferences." Before the County Magistrate Conference was convened, People's Representative Conferences in North China's provinces and cities, with the exception of Suiyuan Province, had already exercised the functions and powers of People's Congresses and had generally been successful. Most counties and banners had also convened multiple People's Representative Conferences, and most of them had been successful. However, most had not yet exercised the functions and powers of People's Congresses, and some places had not been held frequently enough or successfully enough. Many comrades' understanding of People's Representative Conferences had not yet been raised to the necessary principled height, that is, they did not universally recognize that "the People's Representative Conference and the People's Congress system are the basic systems of our country." Therefore, from the beginning of preparations to the convening of the conference, the North China County Magistrate Conference consistently focused on the central link of raising the ideological understanding of cadres. Throughout the North China region, cadres above the county level universally restudied important documents such as Mao Zedong's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" and Liu Shaoqi's speech at the Third People's Representative Conference of Beijing Municipality. Responsible comrades of provincial people's governments and many district commissioners and county magistrates went deep into the grassroots, conducted investigations and visits, convened reporting meetings, and carried out typical experiments. They also strengthened publicity and reporting, linked theory with practice, examined work, and carried out criticism and self-criticism, and summarized experience. During the County Magistrate Conference, they discussed and studied important reports, made resolutions, and further improved cadres' basic understanding of political power building and unified their thinking. Everyone unanimously agreed that the important link in the current democratic political construction in North China is to implement the election of People's Representative Conferences at the county, district, and village (township) levels by the people and to have the People's Representative Conferences at the county, district, and village (township) levels exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congresses. It was also decided that in the North China region this winter and next spring, with the exception of a few counties and banners in Suiyuan, the People's Representative Conferences of all counties would universally exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congresses. Taking the county as the focus of current democratic political construction is because the county is the basic unit for promoting national administration and exercising national power, the hub for connecting local people's governments at all levels, and the core for broadly connecting people from all walks of life and strengthening political work in urban and rural areas. Successfully convening county-level People's Representative Conferences and improving the leadership of county people's government work can comprehensively and widely concentrate the opinions of the people and quickly implement them among the people of the entire county. Through the county-level People's Representative Conferences, the vast number of cadres and people's representatives can be trained and educated in practical democratic life, which is also very helpful for successfully convening People's Representative Conferences or People's Congresses at the district and village (township) levels. On the other hand, successfully convening People's Representative Conferences or People's Congresses at the district and village (township) levels will inevitably promote the work of county-level People's Representative Conferences, giving them a stronger grassroots foundation. However, while focusing on the county in leadership work, it is necessary to prevent and overcome the phenomenon of disconnections in the work of People's Representative Conferences or People's Congresses at the county, district, and village (township) levels.

　　The North China County Magistrate Conference systematically summarized the experiences of various places in successfully convening county-level People's Representative Conferences, stipulating that it is necessary to boldly mobilize the masses to handle the work of representative elections well; the composition of representatives should be broad and fully representative; each meeting should have a central topic and unfold discussions; it is necessary to seriously handle the proposals of the people's representatives; and strengthen the work of the county standing committees to ensure that the county-level People's Representative Conferences truly become a regular and consolidated system.

　　Currently, the work of People's Representative Conferences across the country, as Premier Zhou En-lai said in his political report at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the CPPCC: "The achievements in political construction are only preliminary, and their development is uneven." "People's Representative Conferences in some provinces and cities and the vast majority of counties (cities) have not yet exercised the functions and powers of People's Congresses; this includes a large number of areas where land reform has long been completed." Therefore, we believe that all parts of the country, especially areas where land reform has already been completed, should attach importance to the experience of the North China County Magistrate Conference. Combining with local specific conditions, in 1952, they should adopt the same or similar methods, taking the large administrative region or province as the unit, to convene county magistrate conferences to discuss the work of county-level People's Representative Conferences. This is to raise the ideological understanding of cadres and strive to ensure that all units that should exercise the functions and powers of People's Congresses do so, in order to strengthen the leadership of the working class and expand the mass base of the people's government.

　　The Twelfth Article of the Common Programme of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulated: "The state power of the People's Republic of China belongs to the people. The organs through which the people exercise state power are the People's Congresses and the People's Governments at all levels. The People's Congresses at all levels shall be elected by the people through universal suffrage. The People's Congresses at all levels shall elect the People's Governments at all levels." In order to realize this provision, according to the actual situation in our country, the most practical and effective transitional method is to have the People's Representative Conferences at all levels exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congresses and elect the People's Governments at all levels. At present, we cannot yet adopt the method of "universal suffrage" to produce People's Congresses at all levels. The reason for this "is mainly that the working people are still illiterate, have no experience in elections, and their concern and enthusiasm for elections are temporarily not very sufficient." (Liu Shaoqi's speech at the Third People's Representative Conference of Beijing Municipality) Therefore, prematurely implementing universal suffrage would damage the enthusiasm of the people and make the election only a formality. Facts have proven that the practice of People's Representative Conferences of all circles in provinces, cities, and a few counties exercising the functions and powers of People's Congresses at their respective levels has generally achieved good results. This practice is making the people's democratic political power not only in the democratic essence, but also in the organizational form, gradually tend to be complete, gradually strengthening and consolidating the basic system of the country. This is an important aspect of the current work to further strengthen political power building.

　　The North China County Magistrate Conference discussed and passed the resolution on "earnestly strengthening preferential treatment work," which is also timely. Only by earnestly strengthening the work of giving preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary servicemen can we most effectively consolidate and improve the combat strength of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers; can we better consolidate national defense and strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. All parts of the country should also, at appropriate times and in appropriate ways, inspect and strengthen preferential treatment work.

　　In addition, the North China County Magistrate Conference also raised a very important issue, which is the issue of strengthening the unified leadership of governments at all levels over the overall work. In the past two years, our government departments have convened many kinds of professional conferences. Although these conferences were convened under the unified policy of the People's Government, most of them were solely responsible for and presided over by a specific competent department, and their resolutions were often issued vertically. When the country was newly established, all work had to be deployed from scratch, business guidelines clarified, and business connections strengthened. Under these circumstances, convening professional conferences separately and issuing resolutions vertically were correct and played a significant role. However, this approach inevitably led to fragmentation of work and passivity in leadership at lower-level governments, making lower-level governments feel that the superiors had many things going on, with multiple departments issuing orders, and their centralized leadership and the organic coordination of various tasks were inevitably affected. This North China County Magistrate Conference convened the main responsible cadres of governments at all levels above the county level in North China to participate. In addition to discussing the work of county-level People's Representative Conferences and preferential treatment work, it also discussed the tasks for the overall work of North China this winter and next year, and adopted the "Resolution on the Current Ten Tasks of County People's Governments." This enabled lower-level governments to understand the basic work policies of the higher-level leading organs in a certain period, making it easier for them to combine with local conditions, adapt to local conditions, proactively plan their work, and more easily strengthen the unity of leadership of governments at all levels. This is also an important leadership method that we should promote in the future.

### 推广华北县长会议的经验

　　推广华北县长会议的经验
    今年九月，在中央人民政府政务院领导下，由中央人民政府华北事务部主持召开了一次华北县长会议。这个会议开得很好，它的全部决议已由政务院批准公布，华北地区正在贯彻执行中。
    华北县长会议的中心议题，是讨论“进一步加强县人民代表会议的工作”。在县长会议召开之前，华北省、市人民代表会议除绥远省以外都已经代行了人民代表大会的职权，而且开得都比较好。一般县、旗，也都召开了多次的人民代表会议，多数也开得好；但大多数还没有代行人民代表大会的职权，同时也有些地方开得还不够好或不够经常。不少同志对于人民代表会议的认识，还没有提到应有的原则高度，即没有普遍认识“人民代表会议与人民代表大会制度，是我们国家的基本制度”。因此，华北县长会议从着手准备直到会议召开，一直抓紧了提高干部思想认识这一中心环节。华北全区，县以上干部，普遍重新学习了毛泽东同志“论人民民主专政”、刘少奇同志在北京市第三届人民代表会议上的讲话等重要文件；各省人民政府负责同志和许多地区的专员、县长都深入下层，调查、访问，召开汇报会议，进行典型试验；并加强宣传报道，联系实际，检查工作，开展了批评自我批评，总结了经验。在县长会议举行的期间，讨论和研究了重要的报告做出决议，进一步提高了干部对政权建设的基本认识，统一了思想。大家一致认为当前华北民主建政的重要环节，是要实行由人民来选举县以及区、村（乡）的人民代表会议并由县以及区、村（乡）的人民代表会议来代行人民代表大会的职权；并决定华北全区在今冬明春，除绥远少数县、旗外，普遍实行县各界人民代表会议代行人民代表大会职权。把县作为当前民主政权建设的重点，是因为县是推行国家政务与行使国家权力的基本单位，是沟通地方人民政府上下级间的枢纽，是广泛联系各界人民和加强城乡政治工作的核心。开好县人民代表会议，改进县人民政府工作的领导，就可以全面而广泛地集中人民的意见并迅速地贯彻到全县人民群众中去。通过县人民代表会议可以使广大干部和人民代表在实际的民主生活中得到锻炼和教育，这对于开好区、村（乡）两级人民代表会议或人民代表大会也是很有作用的。另一方面，开好区、村（乡）的人民代表会议或人民代表大会，又必然会促进县人民代表会议的工作，使它有了更坚强的下层基础。但在领导工作上以县为重点，又必须防止和克服县、区、村（乡）的人民代表会议或人民代表大会在工作上彼此脱节的现象。
    华北县长会议曾比较系统地总结了各地怎样开好县人民代表会议的经验，规定必须放手发动群众办好代表选举工作；代表成份应具有广泛的和充分的代表性；每次会议应有中心议题，展开讨论；必须认真处理人民代表的提案；并加强县常务委员会等工作，以保证县人民代表会议真正成为经常的巩固的制度。
    目前，全国各地的人民代表会议工作，正如周恩来总理在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议上的政治报告中所说：“建政工作的成绩，还只是初步的，其发展也是不平衡的。”“部分的省、市和绝大多数的县（市）的人民代表会议，还没有代行人民代表大会的职权；在这里边，包括很大数目的土地改革久已完成的地区。”因此，我们认为全国各地、特别是土地改革业已完成的地区，均应重视华北县长会议的经验，结合当地具体情况，在一九五二年内，采取同样的或类似的方法，以大行政区或省为单位，召开县长会议，讨论县人民代表会议的工作，以提高干部的思想认识，争取作到凡应代行的单位，都代行了人民代表大会职权，以加强工人阶级的领导和扩大人民政府的群众基础。
    中国人民政协共同纲领第十二条曾规定：“中华人民共和国的国家政权属于人民。人民行使国家政权的机关为各级人民代表大会和各级人民政府。各级人民代表大会由人民用普选方法产生之。各级人民代表大会选举各级人民政府。”为着实现这一规定，根据我国现实情况，由各级人民代表会议代行人民代表大会的职权，选举各级人民政府，乃是最切实有效的过渡办法。目前我们还不可能采取“普选”的方法来产生各级人民代表大会，其原因“主要是劳动人民还不识字，过去没有选举的经验，他们对于选举的关心和积极性暂时也还不很充分。”
    （刘少奇同志在北京市第三届人民代表会议上的讲话）因此过早实行普选，反而会损害人民的积极性，使选举只有形式。事实证明，各省、市和少数县的各界人民代表会议代行各该级人民代表大会的职权，这种办法，普遍地收到了良好的效果。这种做法，使人民民主政权不仅在民主的实质上，而且在组织形式上，逐渐趋于完备，逐渐健全和巩固国家的基本制度。这是当前进一步加强政权建设工作的重要内容。
    华北县长会议讨论和通过了“认真加强优抚工作”的决议，这也是适合时宜的。只有认真加强优待革命烈士和革命军人家属的工作，才能最有效地巩固和提高中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军的战斗力量；才能更好地巩固国防和加强抗美援朝的工作。全国各地，也应当在适当时机，采取适当方式，检查和加强优抚工作。
    此外，华北县长会议还提出了一个很重要的问题，这就是加强各级政府对全盘工作的统一领导问题。最近两年来，我们政府各部门召开了很多种的专业会议，这些会议虽然是在人民政府统一方针之下召开的，但这些会议多半只是由某一主管部门单独负责主持，其决议亦往往垂直下达。当国家初建，一切工作都必须从头部署、明确业务方针与加强业务联系。在这种情况下，分别召开专业会议、分头垂直下达决议等办法曾是正确的，并且起了很大的作用。但是，这种办法不可避免地会形成下级政府工作上的分散和领导上的被动，使下级政府感到上边头绪纷繁，政出多门，而他们的集中领导和各种工作的有机配合也不免受到影响。这次华北县长会议召集了华北县以上各级政府主要负责干部参加，除讨论县人民代表会议工作和优抚工作外，还讨论了今冬和明年华北全般工作的任务，通过了“关于县人民政府当前十项工作的决议”，这样就使得下级政府明了上级领导机关在一定时期的基本工作方针，使他们便于结合当地情况，因地制宜，主动地规划自己的工作，更容易地加强各级政府领导上的统一性。这也是我们今后应当提倡的一项重要的领导方法。
