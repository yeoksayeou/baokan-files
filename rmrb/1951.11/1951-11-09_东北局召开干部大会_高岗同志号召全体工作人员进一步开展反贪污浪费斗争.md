    Northeast Bureau Holds Cadre Conference
    Comrade Gao Gang Calls on All Staff to Further Carry Out the Struggle Against Corruption and Waste

    [Report from this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: The Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, in response to Chairman Mao's call at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, convened a conference of cadres directly under the Bureau and responsible cadres of the CPC committees of various provinces and cities on October 26. At the meeting, Comrade Gao Gang, Secretary of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, called on all staff of the Party organizations at all levels in the Northeast to extensively carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, and to further and deeply carry out the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. In his report, Comrade Gao Gang pointed out that the movement to increase production and practice economy is the driving force for promoting various construction works. All production departments and non-production departments must strive to tap the potential production power of their units, clear up assets, register family property, streamline organizations, reduce redundant staff, and improve work efficiency. He said: The biggest enemies of increasing production and practicing economy are corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. We must eliminate these enemies. He said: After the struggle against corruption and bureaucracy in the Northeast organs since September, units that have done well have shown a new atmosphere, which is manifested in: improved leadership level, educated cadres and masses, saved some elements who were heading towards corruption and degeneration, emerged a large number of activists, improved work efficiency, a strong political atmosphere, and greatly reduced organ expenditures. However, we cannot be satisfied with these achievements. There are still many wasteful phenomena that must be overcome with efforts. He particularly pointed out that the losses caused to the country by waste far exceed the losses caused by corruption. We must educate cadres and the masses to oppose waste as we oppose corruption, so that everyone recognizes that corruption is shameful, and waste is also shameful. He cited facts to illustrate that the current wasteful phenomena are mainly manifested in five aspects: first, waste in production and construction; second, losses caused by the irresponsibility of staff; third, waste caused by engaging in small family affairs and not abiding by the system; fourth, waste caused by overlapping institutions; and fifth, waste in living expenses. He said: The key to overcoming waste lies in overcoming bureaucracy in leadership style, strengthening the ideological and political education of all personnel, and strictly stipulating and implementing various work systems and living systems. Finally, he called on leading cadres at all levels, all Party members, and all staff to actively respond to Chairman Mao's call, resolutely fight against all corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, carry out this struggle deeply and thoroughly, and launch the movement to increase production and practice economy more widely.

    东北局召开干部大会
    高岗同志号召全体工作人员进一步开展反贪污浪费斗争
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：中国共产党中央东北局为响应毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议上的号召，在十月二十六日召开了直属机关干部和中共各省、市委员会的负责干部大会。会上，中共中央东北局书记高岗同志号召东北各级党的组织的全体工作人员，广泛开展增产节约运动，进一步深入地开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争。高岗同志在报告中指出：增产节约运动是推动各种建设工作的力量，一切生产部门和非生产部门，都要努力发挥本单位生产的潜在力量，清理资财，登记家务，精简机构，裁减冗员，提高工作效率。他说：增产节约最大的敌人是贪污、浪费和官僚主义。我们必须把这个敌人铲除。他说：东北各机关经过九月份以来反贪污、反官僚主义的斗争，凡是进行得好的单位，都出现了新的气象，这表现在：提高了领导水平，教育了干部和群众，挽救了若干走向贪污蜕化的分子，涌现了大批积极分子，提高了工作效率，政治空气浓厚了，机关开支大大减少了。但是，我们不能满足于这些成绩，现在还有许多浪费现象，必须努力加以克服。他特别指出：浪费给国家造成的损失远远超过贪污所造成的损失。我们必须教育干部和群众，像反对贪污那样来反对浪费，使大家认识到贪污是可耻的，浪费也是可耻的。他列举事实，说明目前的浪费现象主要表现在五个方面：第一是生产和修建中的浪费；第二是因工作人员不负责所造成的损失；第三是搞小家务，不遵守制度所造成的浪费；第四是机构重叠所造成的浪费；第五是生活开支上的浪费。他说：克服浪费的关键在于克服领导作风上的官僚主义，加强全体人员的思想政治教育，严格规定和执行各种工作制度和生活制度。最后，他号召各级领导干部、全体党员和全体工作人员积极地响应毛主席的号召，向一切贪污、浪费和官僚主义坚决进行斗争，把这一斗争进行得深入和彻底，把增产节约运动更广泛地开展起来。
