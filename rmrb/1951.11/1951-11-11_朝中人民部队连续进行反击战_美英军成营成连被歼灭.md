Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 10th. While the American invading troops are continuously attacking north despite suffering heavy casualties, and simultaneously stepping up preparations in an attempt to launch another risky offensive, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, from the western front to the central front, have launched a series of counterattacks, continuously annihilating the American invading troops and their accomplice forces, aided by powerful artillery fire.

At the same time as our army annihilated three complete companies of the British Commonwealth Division at Ma Liang Mountain, west of Tieyuan on the western front, on the night of November 4th, a unit of our army launched a counterattack against the mountain area from Yuji Mountain, northwest of Lianchuan, to Zhengdong on the western front. Our army's fierce artillery fire was unleashed, destroying all the strong fortifications that the enemy had built for eight days. Fierce flames and dense smoke immediately rose from the enemy's positions. Then, our brave infantry troops broke through the enemy's positions in eight minutes, fiercely sweeping the enemy with automatic weapons of various calibers. In just fifteen minutes, our infantry occupied the highest peak in the area. Then, fierce close combat unfolded in the heart of the enemy's area. After more than three hours of fighting, our army completely annihilated a part of the 7th Regiment of the 1st Cavalry Division of the American invading army that was entrenched in the area, killing and wounding more than 800 enemy soldiers, and completely occupied the area south of Yuji Mountain and east of Zhengdong. After suffering this serious blow, the American invading troops quickly mobilized their forces to carry out frantic retaliatory counterattacks, but suffered even more serious losses. On the morning of the 5th, after a unit of our army occupied the area south of Yuji Mountain and west of Zhengdong, the enemy's artillery fiercely bombarded the area, and attacked in turn with about two battalions of troops. A unit of our army immediately gave a firm resistance, causing heavy casualties to the enemy in the whole day's attack. By dusk, the enemy had only climbed to the highlands northwest of Zhengdong. Our army then launched another fierce counterattack against the enemy. Our army's artillery of various calibers opened fire at the same time, making it impossible for the enemy to hide. Then our infantry bravely pounced on the top of the mountain and fought with the enemy until dawn on the 6th. A unit of our army annihilated a part of the counterattacking troops of the 7th Regiment of the 1st Cavalry Division of the US Army. In the above two counterattacks, a total of the entire First Battalion, the Second Battalion, and most of the directly subordinate companies of the 7th Regiment of the 1st Cavalry Division of the US Army were annihilated, killing and wounding 1,700 American soldiers and capturing 55 American soldiers.Seized 17 artillery pieces of various types, 5 rocket launchers, 3 flamethrowers, 30 heavy machine guns, 83 light machine guns, 3 anti-aircraft machine guns, 2 anti-tank guns, 292 automatic rifles, carbines, and short guns, and many other weapons and communications equipment.

In the central front area, a unit of our army also achieved the same major victory in the counterattack. On the night of the 3rd, a unit of our army raided the enemy at Heights 281.2 near Xidong, northwest of Tieyuan. After two hours of fierce fighting, the entire 6th Company of the 29th Regiment of the 9th Division of the Li Pseudo Army in the area was annihilated, killing more than 110 enemy soldiers including the company commander, and capturing more than 20 enemy soldiers. Then, on the night of the 5th, another unit of our army annihilated most of the First and Second Companies, and a part of the Third Company and the Firepower Company, of the 29th Regiment of the 9th Division of the Li Pseudo Army at Heights 394.8. The British Commonwealth 1st Division, which was driven out of the Ma Liang Mountain position by our forces on the 4th, launched a counterattack against the Ma Liang Mountain position on the 5th and 6th with two to three battalions of troops, supported by aircraft, tanks, and artillery. After two days of fierce fighting, they were finally repelled by our strong artillery fire and the brave counterattack of our infantry. Our army killed and wounded more than 450 enemy soldiers. At this point, the enemy's counterattack was declared a failure.

In this counterattack, our army cleanly annihilated many enemy troops by battalions and companies. According to incomplete statistics from November 3rd to 6th, our army annihilated a total of one complete enemy battalion and all of four companies, and most of one battalion and three companies, of which the US army accounted for more than one battalion, and the British army accounted for three companies. The rest were puppet troops.

　　朝中人民部队连续进行反击战
    美英军成营成连被歼灭
    【新华社朝鲜前线十日电】正当美国侵略军不顾惨重伤亡不断向北进行攻击，同时加紧准备，仍图再度冒险进攻的时候，从西线到中线的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，在强大炮火的配合下，进行了一连串的反击战，连续地歼灭了美国侵略军及其帮凶军。
    与我军在西线铁原以西的马良山歼灭英联邦师三个整连的同时，十一月四日夜间，我军某部向西线涟川西北鱼积山里到正洞的山岭地区发起反击。我军猛烈炮火一齐发射，将敌军已构筑了八天的强固工事悉数摧毁，敌军阵地上立刻腾起了炽烈的火焰和浓密的弹烟。接着，我英勇的步兵部队，就以八分钟时间突破了敌军阵地，用各种口径的自动火器猛烈向敌扫射。仅十五分钟我军步兵就占领了该地区最高的一座山峰。于是，激烈的近战便在敌军的心脏地带展开了。经三个多小时的战斗，我军将盘据该地的美国侵略军骑兵第一师第七团一部完全歼灭，毙伤敌军八百多名，并全部占领鱼积山里以南正洞以东地区。美国侵略军在遭受此严重打击后，赶紧调集部队进行疯狂的报复反扑，但是遭到了更加严重的损失。五日晨，当我军某部占领鱼积山里以南正洞以西的地区后，敌军大炮就向该地猛烈轰击，并以约两个营兵力轮番进攻。我军一部当即予以坚强阻击，使敌军在整日攻击中遭到重大伤亡。至黄昏敌人才爬上了正洞西北的高地。我军随即向该敌再次发起猛烈的反击。我军各种口径的大炮一齐开火，打得敌军无处躲藏。接着我步兵部队勇猛扑上山顶，与敌军进行搏斗战至六日拂晓，我军某部又将美军骑兵第一师第七团的反扑部队一部歼灭。在以上两次反击战中，计歼灭美骑一师第七团第一营全部、二营及该团直属连大部，共毙伤美军一千七百名，俘美军五十五名。缴获各种炮十七门，火箭筒五个，火焰喷射器三具，重机枪三十挺，轻机枪八十三挺，高射机枪三挺，战防枪两枝，自动步枪、卡宾枪、短枪共二百九十二枝，及其他武器和通讯器材等甚多。
    在中线地区，我军某部在反击战中也取得了同样重大的胜利。三日晚我军一部猛袭铁原西北方席洞附近二八一点二高地之敌，激战两小时，将该地的李伪军第九师第二十九团第六连全部歼灭，击毙敌军连长以下一百十余名，俘掳敌军二十多名。接着我军另部五日晚又在三九四点八高地歼灭了李伪军第九师二十九团第一、第二两个连的大部和第三连、火器连的一部。四日被我逐出马良山阵地的英联邦一师，五、六两日分别以二至三个营兵力在飞机、战车、炮兵支援下，向马良山阵地反扑，激战两天，终被我强烈炮火及步兵英勇的反击所打退。我军杀伤敌军四百五十多名。至此，敌军的反扑宣告失败。
    我军在此次反击战中，干脆地歼灭了许多成营成连的敌军。据十一月三日至六日的不完全统计，我军合计歼灭敌军一个整营又四个连的全部，和一个营和三个连的大部，其中美军占一个多营，英军占三个连。其余是伪军。
