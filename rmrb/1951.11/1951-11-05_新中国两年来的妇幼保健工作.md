    Two Years of Maternal and Child Health Work in New China
    Zhu Lian
    Since the birth of New China, maternal and child health work across the country, under the leadership of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government and with the enthusiastic assistance of Soviet maternal and child health experts, has made great progress, thus laying the foundation for the maternal and child health cause of the working people of our country.
    Currently, maternal and child health administrative bodies have been established in the health departments of the Central Government, major administrative regions, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and provincial and municipal People's Governments, as well as individual health departments of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Some People's Government health departments below the provincial level have also established maternal and child health administrative bodies or have full-time personnel responsible for maternal and child health work. Maternal and child health organizations have become an integral part of the government, which is unprecedented in China's past history.
    There are now 156 maternal and child medical and preventive institutions nationwide, such as maternal and child health hospitals, maternal and child health centers, obstetrics and gynecology hospitals, maternity hospitals, children's health hospitals, and children's hospitals; a total of 7,699 obstetrics and gynecology and pediatric beds are distributed in various cities (this number includes beds in these two departments of some general hospitals). Seven hundred and forty-four maternal and child health stations have been established in counties, districts, villages, and industrial and mining areas across the country, including 294 in rural areas, 58 in industrial and mining areas, 361 in cities, and 4 in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Nine thousand four hundred and sixty-four delivery stations (groups) have been established nationwide. The Ministry of Health of the Central Government and Shandong, Heilongjiang, Subei, Suiyuan, Chahar and other regions have also organized maternal and child health work teams and maternal and child health work groups to go deep into factories and rural areas to carry out work, which has been warmly welcomed by the people in these areas.
    In terms of cultivating and training maternal and child health cadres: in the past two years, a total of 4,340 nursery workers have been trained across the country; 3,743 maternal and child health workers have been trained (this number is missing data from the Southwest Region and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region); and 458 obstetricians, midwives, childcare educators, and maternal and child health administrative cadres have received advanced training. In order to further cultivate maternal and child health talents, the Department of Public Health of Peking University Medical College has established a special course in maternal and child health; Shenyang City has opened a maternal and infant college; the Maternal and Child Health Experimental Institute of the Ministry of Health of the Central Government has attached a training institute for maternal and child health personnel; and medical colleges and schools across the country have also increased the number of students in obstetrics and gynecology and pediatrics.
    In the vast rural areas of old China, almost 100% of births were delivered using old methods. Even in large cities with better medical equipment, old-fashioned delivery methods accounted for a considerable proportion. Due to the unsanitary nature of the old-style delivery methods, many women developed puerperal fever; according to surveys in some areas, newborns died of tetanus neonatorum accounted for more than 50% of the causes of newborn deaths. For example, according to a survey conducted by the Anti-epidemic Team of the Ministry of Health of the Central Government in Sihong County, northern Anhui: 1,313 parous women gave birth to a total of 6,942 fetuses. Among the 2,220 infants who died within one year of age, 1,110 died from tetanus; among the 1,300-plus parturients, 95 developed puerperal fever. Therefore, promoting new methods of delivery and reforming old methods of delivery has become an important part of the national maternal and child health work. In the past two years, 47,067 old-style midwives have been reformed in North China, 32,322 in Northeast China, 8,885 in East China, 2,045 in Northwest China, 648 in Inner Mongolia, 167 in Southwest China, and 90 in Central and South China (missing 1951 statistics for Northwest, Southwest, and Central and South China), reaching a total of 91,224 nationwide. This has greatly reduced the pain of women during childbirth, and the mortality rate of tetanus neonatorum has also been significantly reduced. Examples are shown in the table below:
    Reforming old methods of delivery is an extremely arduous task. It requires in-depth investigation, extensive publicity, organization of midwife training courses to cultivate new talents and reform old midwives; and these tasks must be combined with the current central tasks of the country and close cooperation with all relevant parties to make it a mass health movement to achieve results. For example, after consultation with the Health Department of Liaoxi Province and the Provincial Democratic Women's Federation and the Cooperative General Society, a cooperative maternal and child health station was set up on a trial basis. Midwives were set up in county and district cooperatives to deliver babies and publicize new methods, and they also took old midwives to work in the countryside so that they could learn new delivery methods. In Zhangwu County, the province used new methods to deliver 250 babies in half a year, and only one was infected with tetanus, which made the masses believe in the new method of delivery. Another example is Peng Huarin, the director of the First District Democratic Women's Federation in Lixian County, Hebei, who, after receiving delivery training, carried out the work of reforming old midwives and publicized various policies of the People's Government, which was welcomed by the peasants.
    The development of children's care also fully demonstrates the happy life of children in New China. Nursery organizations are developing vigorously. According to incomplete statistics, there were no nursery organizations in the Inner Mongolia region before liberation, but eight have been established after liberation; the Northeast region has increased from the original three nurseries to more than 500; and the East China region has increased from 75 nurseries to more than 480. Now, the number of nurseries in factories, institutions, and schools (including private ones) across the country has increased ninefold compared with before liberation, and more than 500,000 children of the working people have received care and education. Among them, the development of factory nursery organizations is the most rapid; seasonal mutual aid and labor exchange nurseries in rural areas are also developing rapidly. This year, more than 10,000 farm busy season nurseries have been established across the country, an increase of more than 106 times compared with last year. The general development of the childcare cause can be seen from the materials in the Northeast region. As shown in the table below:
    Regarding acute infectious diseases in children, all possible measures are taken to prevent those that can be actively prevented. For example, in preventing the spread of smallpox, a total of 119,137,715 children across the country have been vaccinated with cowpox in the past two years. In addition, nearly one million children have received BCG vaccination or pertussis and diphtheria immunization injections. This year, on "June 1" Children's Day, major cities across the country conducted a health checkup for children under the age of seven. The provinces and cities in Northeast China checked 80,442 children, and nine cities in North China checked 32,097 (other regions do not yet have detailed statistics).
    In addition, the Chinese People's Relief Administrations in various places have taken over the so-called "Infant Homes," "Orphanages," and "Sacred Heart Children's Homes" established by imperialists in our country, so that the suffering children can return to the warm embrace of the motherland.
    Maternal and child health propaganda work has also made great achievements in the past two years. In the past two years, 108 kinds of books and periodicals such as "Common Knowledge of Maternal and Child Health Care," "How to Prevent Infectious Diseases in Young Children," "Benefits of Scientific Childbirth," and "Teaching Materials for Reforming Midwives" have been published, with a circulation of 540,000 copies; 18 kinds of picture albums such as "How to Raise a Baby" and "Female Workers' Health Manual" have been published, with a circulation of 90,000 copies; and 23 kinds of wall charts such as "Vaccinate Cowpox Quickly" and "New Method of Delivery" have been published, with a circulation of 690,000 copies. Books on Soviet maternal and infant health work have also been introduced. Thirty-two kinds of delivery teaching models and four kinds of slides have been produced...
    The most meaningful and popular propaganda and education activity among the masses is the maternal and child health exhibition. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 128 maternal and child health exhibitions have been held in cities, industrial and mining areas, and rural areas across the country, with a total audience of 7,295,095 people. Many women automatically went to the maternal and child health team for prenatal checkups after seeing the exhibition, or prepared the necessary supplies for labor before childbirth.
    In order to smoothly promote maternal and child health work, various places have also adopted various forms of propaganda, such as Yangko dances, performances, radio broadcasts, rooftop broadcasts, mass rallies and speeches, blackboard newspapers, propaganda vehicles, mothers' associations, children's associations, etc., to carry out large-scale propaganda activities.
    Although maternal and child health work has made many achievements in the past two years, it is still far from meeting the requirements of the broad masses of the people. For example, most factories have not yet established good health facilities for pregnant female workers, and old-fashioned delivery methods are still quite common in rural areas; although some areas have established maternal and child health institutions, most of them are not sound enough; maternal and child health organizations and women's organizations have not closely cooperated in their work; and there is still a great shortage of maternal and child health cadres. These are all things that we need to work hard to improve in the future. (Attached table)

    新中国两年来的妇幼保健工作
    朱琏
    新中国诞生以来，全国妇幼保健工作，在中央人民政府卫生部的领导下，和苏联妇幼保健工作专家的热情帮助下，已经有了很大的发展，因而奠定了我国劳动人民妇幼保健事业的基础。
    现在，在中央、各大行政区、内蒙古自治区和省、市人民政府的卫生部门以及中国人民解放军个别的卫生部门中，已建立了妇幼卫生行政机构；某些省级以下的人民政府卫生部门中，也建立了妇幼卫生行政机构，或设有负责妇幼卫生工作的专职人员。妇幼保健组织成为政府的组成部分之一，这是中国过去历史上所没有的。
    妇幼的医疗预防业务机构，如妇幼保健院、妇幼保健所、妇产科医院、产院、儿童保健院、儿童医院，全国已有一百五十六处；分布在各城市的妇产科及儿科病床共七千六百九十九张（此数字包括部分普通医院这两科的床位）。县、区、村及工矿区的妇幼保健站，全国已建立七百四十四处，其中有二百九十四处在农村，五十八处在工矿区，三百六十一处在城市，四处在内蒙古自治区。接生站（组）全国已建立九千四百六十四处。中央卫生部及山东、黑龙江、苏北、绥远、察哈尔等地区还组织了妇幼卫生工作队和妇幼卫生工作组，深入工厂与农村进行工作，受到各该地人民的热烈欢迎。
    在培养与训练妇幼保健干部方面：两年来，全国各地共训练保育员四千三百四十名；培养妇幼保健员三千七百四十三名（此数字缺西南区及内蒙古自治区的）；妇产科医师、助产士、保育教育人员、妇幼卫生行政干部进修者共四百五十八名。为了进一步培养妇幼保健卫生人材，北京大学医学院公共卫生系特设立了妇幼卫生专修科；沈阳市开办了妇婴学院；中央卫生部妇幼保健实验院附设了妇幼卫生人员训练所；全国各医学院、校也增添了妇产科、小儿科的学生名额。
    在旧中国的广大农村中，几乎百分之百是用旧法接产的。就是医药设备比较好的大城市，旧法接产也占相当数量。由于旧式接产法的不卫生，产妇发生产褥热的很多；初生儿死于破伤风的，根据某些地区的调查，占初生儿死亡原因的百分之五十以上，如中央卫生部防疫队在皖北泗洪县调查：一千三百一十三名经产妇，共生育六千九百四十二胎，在周岁婴儿死亡的二千二百二十名中，就有一千一百十名是因破伤风死的；一千三百多名产妇中发生产褥热的就有九十五名。因此推广新法接产与改造旧接产法，已成为全国妇幼卫生工作中的重要一环。两年来，经过改造的接产婆，华北有四万七千零六十七名，东北有三万二千三百二十二名，华东有八千八百八十五名，西北有两千零四十五名，内蒙有六百四十八名，西南有一百六十七名，中南有九十名（缺西北、西南、中南地区的一九五一年统计数字），全国共达九万一千二百二十四名。因而使妇女生育时的痛苦大大地减轻了；初生儿破伤风死亡率也显著地减低了。举例如下表：
    改造旧接产法，是一件极为艰苦的工作，必须经过深入调查，进行广泛宣传，组织助产训练班培养新人材和改造旧接产婆；而这些工作又须结合国家当前的中心任务，与各有关方面取得密切配合，使它成为群众性的卫生运动，才能获得效果。例如辽西省卫生厅和省民主妇女联合会、合作总社会商后，试办合作社妇幼保健站，在县、区合作社内设立助产士，一面接产一面宣传，又带着旧接产婆一起下乡工作，使她们学习了新接产法。该省彰武县半年里用新法接产孩子二百五十个，只有一个染上破伤风，因此使群众相信了新接产法；又如河北蠡县第一区民主妇女联合会主任彭化仁，她受了接产训练后，即进行改造旧接产婆的工作，并宣传人民政府的各种政策，受到了农民的欢迎。
    儿童保育事业的发展，也充分表现了新中国儿童的幸福生活。托儿组织正在蓬勃地发展着，据不完全统计，内蒙古地区解放前没有托儿所组织，解放后已设立了八所；东北区由原来的三所托儿所增加到五百多所；华东区由七十五所托儿所增加到四百八十多所。现在全国工厂、机关、学校（包括私人创办的）托儿所比解放前增加了九倍，受到保育和教育的劳动人民的子女达五十万以上。其中尤以工厂托儿组织的发展最为迅速；农村中季节性的互助变工的农忙托儿所也在飞跃地发展，今年全国建立农忙托儿所一万多处，比去年增加了一百零六倍强。从东北区的材料就可看出保育事业的一般发展情况。如下表：
    关于儿童急性传染病，凡能积极预防的，无不设法进行预防。如在防止天花的流行方面，两年来全国接种牛痘的儿童共一亿一千九百十三万七千七百十五名。此外，近百万的儿童获得卡介苗的接种或百日咳、白喉预防注射。今年“六一”儿童节，全国各大城市对七岁以下的儿童进行了一次健康检查。东北各省市检查了八万零四百四十二名，华北九个城市检查了三万二千九十七名（其他地区还没有详细的统计材料）。
    此外，各地中国人民救济机关分别接收了帝国主义在我国设立的所谓“育婴堂”“孤儿院”“圣心儿童院”等，使受难的儿童回到祖国温暖的怀抱里。
    妇幼卫生宣传工作两年来也有很大的成绩。两年来出版了“孕产妇保健常识”、“怎样预防幼童传染病”“科学接生的好处”“改造接产婆教材”等书刊一百零八种，发行了五十四万册；出版了“怎样养娃娃”“女工卫生手册”等画册十八种，发行九万册；出版了“快种牛痘”“新法接生”等挂图二十三种，发行六十九万幅。又介绍了关于苏联妇婴卫生工作的书籍。并制出接产教学模型三十二种、幻灯片四种……。
    宣传教育意义最大又最受群众欢迎的是妇幼卫生展览会。据不完全统计，全国各城市、各工矿、农村举行妇幼卫生展览共一百二十八次，观众达七百二十九万五千零九十五人。许多妇女在看了展览会以后自动找妇幼卫生队作产前检查，或在产前准备好临产时的必需用品。
    为了顺利地推行妇幼卫生工作，各地还采取各种各样的宣传方式，如秧歌、演剧、电台广播、屋顶广播、群众集会讲演、黑板报、宣传车、母亲会、儿童会等等，进行了规模广大的宣传活动。
    两年来妇幼保健工作虽然取得了不少成绩，但是离开广大人民的要求还很远，如一般工厂还没有很好地建立怀孕女工的卫生设备，农村中旧法接产还相当普遍；有些地区虽已建立了妇幼卫生机构，但是多半不够健全；妇幼卫生机关与妇女团体在工作上还没有密切配合；妇幼保健干部也还很缺乏。这些都是需要我们今后努力改进的。（附图表）
