Introduction to the contents of the Chinese edition of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy," Issue 114, the organ of the Information Bureau of Communist and Workers' Parties. This issue's main contents include the full text of "Comrade Stalin's Answers to Questions from a 'Pravda' Correspondent on the Issue of Atomic Weapons" and the editorial published by the newspaper on Comrade Stalin's talk, "A Great Contribution to Safeguarding and Consolidating the Cause of Peace," "‘United Europe’ is a Smoke Screen for the Rearmament of West Germany" by G. Cogniot, Member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, and "The Tito Fascist Clique ‘Legalizes’ Capitalism in Yugoslavia" by Constantininescu, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, and other articles. In the editorial, the newspaper said: "Public opinion in all countries justly believes that Comrade Stalin's talk is a document of world historical significance, a new and outstanding contribution to the cause of peace, and another proof of the Soviet Union's consistent advocacy of a policy of peace. It has increased the confidence of all peace fighters and all honest people in the invincible strength of the peace and democracy camp, and encouraged them to fight to further strengthen the defense of peace and prevent the danger of a new war. It has dampened the spirit of the warmongers because the main weapon they rely on to threaten and blackmail the peace-loving people of all countries has been knocked out of their hands." The newspaper concluded: "Stalin's talk will help to further unite and expand the ranks of peace supporters, further develop and expand the movement to strive for the conclusion of a peace pact, strive for the complete prohibition of atomic weapons, and maintain and strengthen world peace."

In the article "‘United Europe’ is a Smoke Screen for the Rearmament of West Germany," Cogniot pointed out: "The so-called 'European Army' is completely deceptive, and its purpose is nothing more than to weaken the national resistance of Western European countries, which have very unpleasant memories of German militarism. Moreover, has not reactionary West Germany already been assigned the role of the decisive force in the entire Western European military system? And that is what the American tycoons want." In the article "The Tito Fascist Clique ‘Legalizes’ Capitalism in Yugoslavia," Constantininescu said: "As early as 1949, the Information Bureau of Communist and Workers' Parties pointed out in its resolution: ‘The state-owned part of the Yugoslav economy is no longer the property of the people, because the power is in the hands of the enemies of the people.’ However, although the state-owned property in industry, mining, and banking was capitalist in nature at that time, it still hindered the 'free' plunder of this property by foreign imperialists and the complete restoration of the Yugoslav bourgeoisie. Therefore, in June 1950, the Tito clique began to abolish the state-owned sector and transfer enterprises to 'workers' committees,' which in fact were management committees headed by former capitalist employers. In terms of salary alone, the income of the managers of these enterprises exceeded the average wage of workers by thirty to forty times, or even fifty times. This is a characteristic unique to capitalist enterprises. In this way, the Tito clique is simultaneously creating a new Yugoslav bourgeois class through its various 'economic' measures." "After the Tito gang officially implemented the capitalist trade system in January 1951, and after dissolving the so-called 'State Planning Commission' and all planning agencies in the federal republics in April of the same year, they created a series of draft laws on the 'new planning and financial system,' which meant the open restoration of capitalism in Yugoslavia. The ‘New Law’ stipulates that the ‘independent plans’ of each enterprise will be drafted by the capitalist employers themselves. Business owners can legally unite under the guise of economic associations according to region and industry and enjoy the right to approve ‘social plans.’ The so-called national social plan will actually be approved first by foreign imperialists, because they are the owners of Yugoslavia's mines and basic enterprises and play a leading role in the 'economic associations'." Constantininescu concluded: "This ‘New Law’ is intended to create economic chaos and lead it to bankruptcy. It will inevitably lead to an economic and political crisis in Yugoslavia, and the only way out of this crisis is to overthrow the Tito gang's fascist dictatorship and liberate Yugoslavia from the shackles of American and British enslavers."

　　《争取持久和平，争取人民民主》中文版第一一四期内容介绍
    共产党与工人党情报局机关报《争取持久和平争取人民民主》中文版第一一四期出版了。这一期的主要内容有《关于原子武器问题斯大林同志答真理报记者问》全文及该报对斯大林同志谈话所发表的社论《维护和巩固和平事业的伟大贡献》，法国共产党中央委员谷尼欧作的《“统一的欧洲”是重新武装西德的烟幕》，罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会政治局委员康斯坦丁尼斯库作的《铁托法西斯集团把南斯拉夫的资本主义“合法化”》等文章。在社论中，该报说：“所有国家的舆论都公正地认为，斯大林同志的这个谈话是一个具有世界历史意义的文件，是对和平事业的一个新的卓越的贡献，是苏联一贯主张和平政策的又一明证。它使一切和平战士、一切正直的人们对于和平民主阵营的无敌的力量增加了信心，鼓舞他们为进一步加强保卫和平、制止新战争的危险而斗争。它挫折了战争贩子们的锐气，因为他们所恃以威胁和讹诈各国爱好和平的人民的主要武器已经从他们的手上被打落了”。该报最后指出：“斯大林这一谈话将有助于进一步团结和扩大和平拥护者的队伍，进一步发展和扩大争取缔结和平公约运动，争取彻底禁止原子武器，保持并加强世界和平”。
    在《“统一的欧洲”是重新武装西德的烟幕》一文中，谷尼欧指出：“所谓‘欧洲军’完全是欺骗，它的目的无非在于削弱对于德国军国主义有很不愉快记忆的西欧各国人民的民族抗拒。况且，反动的西德，不是已被派充整个西欧军事体系中的决定性力量这个角色了吗？而这就是美国的豪门巨富们所要的东西”。在《铁托法西斯集团把南斯拉夫的资本主义“合法化”》一文，康斯坦丁尼斯库说：“早在一九四九年，共产党与工人党情报局就已经在决议中指出：‘南斯拉夫经济的国营部分已不再是人民的财产了，因为政权是操在人民的敌人手里的’。但是，工业、矿业和银行里的国有财产当时虽然是资本主义性的，但是还在一定程度上妨碍了外国帝国主义者‘自由’掠夺这种财产，妨碍了南斯拉夫资产阶级完全恢复。于是在一九五○年六月，铁托集团就开始取消国有部分，把企业转移到‘工人委员会’手里，而‘工人委员会’事实上就是管理委员会，其首脑都是以前的资本家雇主。单单就薪水来说，这些企业的经理的收入就超过工人的平均工资三十倍到四十倍，甚至五十倍。这是资本主义企业所独具的特征。铁托集团就这样靠它的种种‘经济’措施同时在制造着新的南斯拉夫资产阶级阶层。”“铁托匪帮在一九五一年一月正式实行了资本主义贸易制度以后，在同年四月解散了所谓‘国家计划委员会’和联邦各共和国的一切计划机构以后，他们制造出一连串关于‘新的计划与财政制度’的法律草案，这些法律草案意味着公开恢复南斯拉夫的资本主义。《新法》规定，各企业的‘独立计划’，将由资本家雇主自己拟订。企业主可以合法地在经济联合会这个幌子下按照地区和工业性质联合起来，并享有批准‘社会计划’的权利。而所谓国家社会计划实际上将首先得到外国帝国主义者的批准，因为他们是南斯拉夫的矿场和基本企业的所有者，在‘经济联合会’中是起领导作用的。”康斯坦丁尼斯库最后说：“这种《新法》是要在经济上造成一片混乱并引导它走向破产。它将不可避免地使南斯拉夫发生经济和政治危机，而要摆脱这种危机，唯一的出路便是推翻铁托匪帮的法西斯独裁并把南斯拉夫从美英奴役者的羁绊中解放出来。”
