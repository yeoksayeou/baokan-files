Report to Chairman Mao on Achievements in Increasing Production and Reducing Costs
Yangquan Iron Plant's Ironmaking Workers Strive to Increase Production, Reducing the Cost per Ton of Iron by 21 Percent
Respected Chairman Mao: Under your leadership, in the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, we have brought into play the spirit of patriotism, production enthusiasm, and creativity. We have strengthened political study, delved into professional skills, and workers and apprentices have learned from each other. With the help of engineers, technology, operation, equipment, and materials have been greatly improved and enhanced. In the nineteen days from October 8th to 27th, the ironmaking production of our plant's small No. 2 blast furnace repeatedly broke the unprecedented record of overfulfilling the daily production plan by 143 percent six times. The utilization coefficient of the blast furnace dropped from 3.4 cubic meters to a new record of 1.658 cubic meters. Preliminary calculations show that the cost per ton was reduced by 21 percent. We also completed the monthly production plan four days ahead of schedule, driving the plant's entire ironmaking task to complete the monthly production plan three days ahead of schedule. We dedicate this great production victory as a gift to mark the first anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' departure to fight abroad.
This harvest is due to your leadership and the efforts of all employees. In addition to reporting this good news to you, we will continue our efforts on the existing basis, overcome all difficulties in our work, thoroughly implement the tasks of economic construction and political struggle, and strive to further improve quality, create higher new records, and complete the state's 1951 production tasks ahead of schedule and above quota.
　The Entire Staff of State-Owned Yangquan Iron Plant

    向毛主席报告增加生产降低成本的成绩
    阳泉铁厂炼铁工人努力增产使每吨铁降低成本百分之二一
    敬爱的毛主席：我们在你的领导下，在抗美援朝运动中，发挥了爱国主义生产积极性、创造性的精神，加强了政治学习，钻研业务技术，职工师徒相互学习，并有工程师帮助，促使技术、操作、设备、料量等各方面均大大改进和提高。在十月八日至二十七日十九天过程中，我厂小型二高炉的炼铁生产，连创六次史无前例超额完成日产计划百分之一四三的纪录，高炉利用系数由三·四立方公尺降到一·六五八立方公尺的新纪录，初步计算，每吨降低成本百分之二一，并提前四天完成月产计划，带动全厂的炼铁任务提前三天完成月产计划。以此生产大胜利，作为向中国人民志愿军出国作战一周年的献礼。
    由于你的领导及全体职工的努力，才有此收获。为此除向你报喜外，我们还要在现有基础上，再接再厉，克服工作中的一切困难，将经济建设与政治斗争任务贯彻到底，为进一步提高质量再创更高新纪录，提前超额完成国家一九五一年的生产任务而奋斗。　国营阳泉铁厂全体职工
