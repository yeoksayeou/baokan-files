Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 7th: TASS Moscow, 7th: The Soviet Army Minister issued Order No. 142 on November 7, 1951, the full text of which is as follows:

    Comrades soldiers and non-commissioned officers of the Army! Comrades junior officers, senior officers and generals of the Army!

    Today, the Soviet Army and the entire Soviet people are celebrating the 34th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, which liberated our working people from capitalist enslavement.

    The people of our motherland are greeting the great October Revolution Day with remarkable achievements in all aspects of political and economic life. After completing the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan, the Soviet people have achieved new victories in realizing the 1951 national economic plan. The development of Soviet science, culture and art has achieved great success. The material welfare of the Soviet people is improving year by year.

    All these achievements of the Soviet people should be attributed to the outstanding leadership of the glorious Bolshevik Party and to their beloved leader and mentor, Comrade Stalin.

    The Soviet Union is committed to constructive labor and has consistently pursued a policy of peace and cooperation among all nations, a policy that serves the vital interests of hundreds of millions of people in all countries.

    The imperialist camp, headed by the ruling circles of the United States, does not want peace and is openly preparing for a new world war against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. It is precisely for this purpose that the imperialists are hastily forming aggressive blocs, carrying out an arms expansion movement, and reviving regular armies in West Germany and Japan.

    The soldiers of the Soviet Union fully understand their task of defending the country, vigilantly guard the security of our motherland, unremittingly perfect their military and political knowledge, and improve the combat readiness of the army in every possible way.

    The Soviet people can fully rely on their army - it is a reliable defender of the achievements of the great October Revolution.

    Comrades soldiers, non-commissioned officers, junior officers, senior officers, and generals of the Army! On this great 34th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, I extend my respects and congratulations to you. I wish you new achievements in military and political training.

    To celebrate this national day, I order: Today, November 7th, in our capital Moscow, the capitals of the Union Republics, Kaliningrad, Rostov, Khabarovsk, Vladivostok, and the heroic cities of Leningrad, Stalingrad, Sevastopol, and Odessa, each fire twenty salvoes.

    Long live the heroic Soviet people and their glorious Soviet Army!

    Long live our beloved Soviet government!

    Long live the great party of Lenin and Stalin!

    Glory to the inspirer and organizer of all our victories, our beloved leader, wise mentor and the genius who has always led our army, the great Stalin!

    Soviet Army Minister, Marshal of the Soviet Union, Vasilevsky

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 7th: TASS Moscow, 7th: The Soviet Navy Minister issued Order No. 109 on November 7, 1951, as follows:

    Comrades sailors and non-commissioned officers of the Navy! Comrades naval officers and generals!

    Today, the Soviet Navy and the entire Soviet people are celebrating the 34th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

    Under the inspiration and organization of the great Lenin-Stalin Party, the people of our Soviet motherland are constantly achieving new and outstanding victories in building communism and further expanding the power of the Soviet state.

    The camp of peace, democracy and socialism, headed by the Soviet Union, is constantly strengthening and expanding.

    The Soviet Navy welcomes this great festival with new achievements in combat and political training, and fulfills the instructions of our great leader and mentor, Comrade Stalin, vigilantly guarding the maritime borders of our motherland and the national interests.

    The American and British warmongers are intensifying their sabotage activities against the Soviet Union, the People's Democratic countries and the People's Republic of China, continuing their frenzied arms expansion movement, expanding military bases, establishing mercenary armies to prepare for military adventures, attempting to deceive the people with lies and dragging them into a new world war.

    Under these circumstances, it is the responsibility of the naval personnel to stubbornly raise vigilance, improve the combat readiness of ships, improve their military skills every day, master complex military equipment, strengthen military discipline, efficiency and order, and do their best to achieve excellent results in military and political training for more people.

    Comrades sailors and non-commissioned officers of the Navy! Comrades naval officers and generals, on the occasion of the 34th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, I extend my congratulations to you and wish you new achievements in military and political training.

    Long live our great Soviet motherland!

    Long live the heroic Soviet people and their Navy!

    Long live our beloved Soviet government!

    Long live the Soviet people's tempered vanguard, the inspirer and organizer of our victory - the great Lenin-Stalin Party!

    Glory to our great wise leader and mentor, Comrade Stalin!

    Soviet Navy Minister, Vice Admiral of the Navy, Kuznetsov

    苏联陆军部长海军部长发布命令
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科七日电：苏联陆军部长于一九五一年十一月七日发布第一百四十二号命令，全文如下：
    陆军战士和士官同志们！陆军尉官、校官和将军同志们！
    今天，苏军和全体苏联人民一道庆祝使我国劳动人民解脱资本主义奴役的伟大的十月社会主义革命三十四周年纪念。
    我们祖国的人民以政治和经济生活各方面的显著成就，来迎接伟大的十月革命节。苏联人民在完成了战后斯大林五年计划以后，又在实现一九五一年国民经济计划上取得了新的胜利。苏联科学、文化和艺术的发展，是有很大的成就的。苏联人民的物质福利，一年比一年提高。
    苏联人民的这一切成就，应归功于光荣的布尔什维克党的卓越领导，归功于他们的爱戴的领袖和导师斯大林同志。
    苏联致力于建设性劳动，一直信守不渝地执行着和平与各民族合作的政策，为各国千百万人民的切身利益服务的政策。
    以美国统治集团为首的帝国主义阵营不要和平，而且正在公开地进行反苏、反人民民主国家的新世界大战的准备工作。正是为了这种目的，帝国主义者才匆忙组成侵略集团，进行扩张军备运动并在西德和日本复活着正规军队。
    苏联的战士们充分了解自己的卫国任务，警觉地守卫着我们祖国的安全，坚持不懈地使自己的军事和政治知识日臻完美，用一切可能的方法提高军队的战斗准备。
    苏联人民可以充分地依靠他们的陆军——它是伟大十月革命的成果的可靠的保卫者。
    陆军战士、士官、尉官、校官、将军同志们！在这伟大的十月社会主义革命三十四周年的时候，我向你们致敬和祝贺。祝你们在军事和政治的训练上，获得新的成就。
    为了庆祝这一个国庆日，我命令：今日，十一月七日，在我国首都莫斯科，各加盟共和国首都，加里宁格勒、罗夫、伯力、海参崴，以及列宁格勒、斯大林格勒、塞瓦斯托波尔、敖德萨等英雄城市各鸣礼炮二十响。
    英勇的苏联人民和他们的光荣的苏军万岁！
    我们爱戴的苏联政府万岁！
    伟大的列宁和斯大林的党万岁！
    光荣归于我们一切胜利的鼓舞者和组织者、我们热爱的领袖、英明的导师和一直领导我国陆军的天才，伟大的斯大林！
    苏联陆军部长、苏联元帅华西列夫斯基
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科七日电：苏联海军部长于一九五一年十一月七日发布第一○九号命令如下：
    海军战士与士官同志们！海军校尉与将军同志们！
    今天，苏联海军和全体苏联人民一道庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命三十四周年。
    在伟大的列宁—斯大林党的鼓舞和组织之下，我们苏维埃祖国的人民在建设共产主义以及更进一步扩大苏维埃国家的威力方面，正不断取得新的杰出胜利。
    以苏联为首的和平民主和社会主义阵营在不断地增强和扩大。
    苏联海军以战斗训练和政治训练方面的新成就来欢迎这伟大的节日，并履行我们伟大的领袖和导师斯大林同志的指示，警觉地守卫着我们祖国的海上边境和国家利益。
    美英战争挑拨者正在加强对苏联、人民民主国家和中华人民共和国的破坏活动，继续进行疯狂的扩张军备运动，扩大军事基地，建立雇佣军以准备进行军事冒险，企图以谎言来迷惑人民，并把他们拖进新的世界战争里。
    在这样情况之下，海军人员的责任是顽强地提高警觉，提高舰只的战斗准备，每天改进自己的军事技巧，掌握复杂的军事装备，加强军事纪律、效率和秩序，尽力使更多的人在军事和政治训练方面取得优良的成果。
    海军战士与士官同志们！海军校尉与将军同志们，值此伟大十月社会主义革命三十四周年，我向你们致意祝贺，并祝你们在军事和政治训练方面取得新的成就。
    我们伟大的苏维埃祖国万岁！
    英雄的苏联人民和他们的海军万岁！
    我们亲爱的苏联政府万岁！
    苏联人民百炼成钢的先锋队、我们胜利的鼓舞者和组织者——伟大的列宁—斯大林党万岁！
    光荣归于我们伟大明智的领袖和导师斯大林同志！
    苏联海军部长、海军中将库兹聂佐夫
