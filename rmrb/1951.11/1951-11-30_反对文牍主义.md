The Political Law Committee of the Government Administration Council and the central political and legal departments recently held a secretarial work conference and jointly organized an "Anti-Bureaucratic Style of Work Document Exhibition." With a spirit of self-criticism and self-education, they conducted mutual inspections and publicly exposed some of the shortcomings of their organizations in handling official documents through examples. At the same time, various departments jointly signed a covenant to simplify official documents, stipulating specific measures for improving the secretarial work of the organizations in the future. The exhibition has attracted the attention of thousands of staff members and has great educational significance, and it is still on tour.

The exhibition revealed the following phenomena: Some ordinary official documents went through more than a dozen responsible cadres for review and approval within the department, and dozens of receiving and dispatching procedures; some traveled back and forth between several departments more than a dozen times, taking four or five months. Everyone lived in the same city, even in the same organization or in the same courtyard, and many daily matters could be handled quickly by telephone or direct consultation, but they were still "handled according to official procedures," "reviewed and approved at each level," "official documents circulated in circles," and "paperwork flew all over the courtyard." All these bureaucratic phenomena of delaying work and cumbersome procedures are objectively a manifestation of being insufficiently responsible to the people. Due to the existence of these phenomena, most of the working comrades in the organizations are trapped in unnecessary paperwork, and it may seem that they are all very busy, but the real work efficiency is not high.

Bureaucratic style of work is not only a problem of the secretarial staff of the organizations, but also a problem of the leadership style and working methods of the organizations. Its occurrence is also inseparable from the phenomenon of the large number of institutions and overlapping organizations in our many organizations. This is a manifestation of bureaucratism, and it is the poison left to us by the corrupt old yamen style. It is divorced from the masses, divorced from the lower levels, and divorced from reality, and we must resolutely oppose it. In particular, the work of senior government agencies is mostly work that is broadly integrated with mass movements, and should be oriented towards the masses and carry out principled leadership. Therefore, its working methods must not be limited to sitting in the office to review official documents.

We must recognize that so-called official documents are only one of the tools for the government to promote work and solve problems; they are not the purpose of the work of government agencies. The reason why bureaucratic style of work is a manifestation of bureaucratism is that it regards handling official documents as the only way to handle affairs and the purpose of work. It can be done without using one's brain, handling official documents for the sake of handling official documents, or hindering the improvement of working methods under the pretext of "not handling formal official documents is not formal" or "without official documents, there is no way to check." As everyone knows, if organizations handle affairs in this way, the result can only be reduced efficiency and only be divorced from the masses. Therefore, we must combine this streamlining of organizations with opposing the bureaucratic style of work. Of course, this is not to oppose the necessary paperwork, let alone to advocate guerrilla-style work. What we want is a scientific and regular style of work that improves efficiency, and we never want the so-called "regularity" of that bureaucratic style of work.

The central political and legal departments have conducted several inspections of official document reforms, and the leadership has always paid great attention to the streamlining and thrift of the organizations and the improvement of work efficiency; however, the phenomenon of bureaucratic style of work still exists in some links. This shows that overcoming the bureaucratic style of work is not easy. Therefore, government agencies at all levels, especially general senior government agencies, should conduct a general inspection of bureaucratic style of work in order to improve working methods. The central political and legal departments use examples from the exhibition to enlighten and educate all staff members to pay attention to improving working methods, which is worthy of being widely promoted. We must thoroughly eliminate all old and corrupt working styles.

### 反对文牍主义

    反对文牍主义
    政务院政治法律委员会和中央政法各部门，最近召开了秘书工作会议，并联合举办了一个“反文牍主义公文展览会”，以自我批评和自我教育的精神，相互检查，并以实例来公开揭露他们的机关在公文处理上的若干缺点。同时各部门联合签订了一个简化公文的公约，规定了今后改进机关秘书工作的具体办法。展览会已吸引了成千机关人员的注意力，具有很大的教育意义，现在还在巡回展览中。
    展览会揭露了这样的现象：有的普通公文，在本部门内经过了十多个负责干部批阅，几十道收发手续；有的在几个部门间往返十几次，旅行了四、五个月。大家同住在一个城市，甚至同在一个机关，或一个院内，很多日常事宜，明明可以用电话或直接碰头协商等办法很快地处理的，却仍是“公事公办”，“层层核批”，“公文团团转”，“条条儿满院飞”。所有这些办事拖延、手续繁琐等文牍主义现象，客观上都是对人民不够负责的表现。由于这些现象的存在，使机关里多数工作同志陷在不必要的文牍圈内，看起来也许都是很忙似的，可是真正的工作效率并不高。
    文牍主义不单是机关秘书工作人员的问题，而是机关的领导作风、工作方法的问题，它的发生又是与我们许多机关存在着机构庞大、组织重叠等现象分不开的。这是官僚主义的一种表现形式，是腐朽的旧衙门作风留给我们的遗毒。它脱离了群众，脱离了下层，脱离了实际，我们必须坚决反对它。特别是高级政府机关的工作，大都是广泛与群众运动相结合的工作，应当面向群众，进行原则的领导，因而它的工作方式决不能仅限于坐在办公室批阅公文。
    我们必须认识所谓公文仅是政府推行工作和解决问题的工具之一，它不是政府机关工作的目的。文牍主义所以是官僚主义的一种表现形式，就是因为它把办公文当作了办事的唯一方法和工作目的。它可以不用脑筋，为办公文而办公文，或者以“不办正式公文，就是不正规”、“不办公文，没法查对”等为藉口，阻碍工作方法的改进。殊不知机关办事如果都要这样做法，其结果只能是减低效率，只会是脱离群众。所以我们必须结合这次精简机构，同时反对文牍主义作风。当然这不是反对必要的文牍工作，更不是因此而提倡什么游击主义作风。我们要的是科学的提高办事效率的正规作风，而决不要那文牍主义的所谓“正规”。
    中央政法部门早就进行过几次公文改革的检查，领导方面向来是非常注意机关的精简节约和提高工作效率的；可是文牍主义的现象依然存在于某些环节。这就说明，文牍主义作风的克服并不是很容易的。因此，各级政府机关，尤其是一般高级政府机关，应该对文牍主义作一次普遍地检查，以便改进工作方法。中央政法部门用展览的实例，来启示和教育一切机关人员注意改进工作的方法，值得广为推行。我们必须把一切旧的、腐朽的工作作风加以彻底清除。
