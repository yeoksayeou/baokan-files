    Resolution of the Belgian Association for the Defense of Peace
    The recent statement by the United States regarding the possible use of atomic bombs, and the Soviet Union's testing of atomic bombs, have drawn the world's attention to the serious threat faced by humanity.
    Only the prohibition of the use of atomic bombs and the strict international control of atomic energy production can satisfy the demands of all peace-loving people, a demand that has long been demonstrated by the five hundred million signatures on the Stockholm Appeal.
    The Belgian Association for the Defense of Peace calls on the public, major social groups, and people's organizations of our country to unite in demanding that the five great powers conclude a peace pact. The conclusion of a peace pact would facilitate the destruction of stockpiled atomic bombs and establish international control over atomic energy production, thereby eliminating the threat of atomic weapons; the conclusion of a peace pact would eliminate the danger of annihilation for the people of our country and the people of the world.
                                   October 9, 1951, Brussels

    比利时保卫和平联合会决议
    美国最近关于可能使用原子弹的声明，和苏联关于原子弹的试验，已引起全世界注意到人类所遭受的严重威胁。
    只有禁止使用原子弹和严格实行国际管制原子能生产，才能满足全体和平人民的要求，这种要求早已在五亿人签署斯德哥尔摩宣言一事上表现出来。
    比利时保卫和平联合会号召我国公众、各大社会团体和人民团体一致起来要求五大国缔结和平公约。缔结和平公约，就可以促成积存的原子弹的销毁并建立对原子能生产的国际管制，从而消除原子武器的威胁；缔结和平公约，就可以消除我国人民以及全世界人民遭到毁灭的危险。
                                   一九五一年十月九日 于布鲁塞尔
