　　Overcoming Conservative Reluctance to Sell and Completing the National Sales Plan
    In October, the China Department Store Corporation only completed 78.5 percent of its sales plan. This issue should attract the serious attention of leading cadres in state-owned trading departments.

    The main reason why department stores failed to complete their sales plan is that some cadres have serious conservative reluctance to sell. They see a large number of goods stored in the warehouse, but are reluctant to sell them. As a result, the state's sales plan has been disrupted.

    Comrades who have this conservative reluctance to sell know that certain industrial products do not meet the needs of the market. They are afraid that if the goods are sold out, they will no longer have the power to lead the market and stabilize prices; therefore, they want to control "strong materials" "to meet various emergency needs." Their starting point is not necessarily bad. However, the losses caused to the state by these comrades' conservative reluctance to sell are very large. First, it disrupts the state's sales plan and accumulates state funds; second, it leaves a large number of goods in the warehouse, while the market lacks the necessary materials, which may cause price fluctuations.

    Comrades in state-owned trading agencies should immediately overcome this wrong thinking. They should learn to do two things with one yuan, not one thing with two yuan. They should vigorously promote the sale of goods and expand sales. Only by selling the goods out early can we continue processing and ordering. That is to say, we should expand reproduction and solve the market supply problem by accelerating capital turnover. Restricting sales can only have bad consequences.

### 克服保守惜售思想完成国家推销计划

　　克服保守惜售思想完成国家推销计划
    中国百货公司十月份仅完成推销计划的百分之七十八点五。这一问题，应该引起国营贸易部门领导干部的严重注意。
    百货公司没有完成推销计划的主要原因，是某些干部存在着严重的保守惜售思想。他们眼看着仓库里存着大批货物，但是舍不得出卖。国家的推销计划，因此就被破坏了。
    有这种保守惜售思想的同志，知道某些工业品不足市场的需要，他们害怕把货物推销完了，再没有力量领导市场，平稳物价；因此，他们要掌握“雄厚的物资”，“以应付各种紧急的需要”。他们的出发点并不一定是坏的。但是，这些同志的保守惜售思想给国家招致的损失是很大的。第一、它破坏了国家的推销计划，积压了国家的资金；第二、它使大批货物呆在仓库中，而市场上却缺乏应有的物资，这就有可能引起物价的波动。
    国营贸易机关的同志，应该立即克服这种错误思想，要学会用一个钱办两个钱的事，不要用两个钱办一个钱的事。应该大力推销货物，扩大卖价额。只有把货物早些推销出去，才有可能继续加工、订货。这就是说，应该用加速资金周转的方法，扩大再生产，解决市场的供应问题。而限制推销，只能造成恶果。
