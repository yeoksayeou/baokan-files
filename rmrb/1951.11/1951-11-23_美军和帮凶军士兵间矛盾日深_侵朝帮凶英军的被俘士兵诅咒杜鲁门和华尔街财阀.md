Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 22nd -- Our front-line reporter reports: Contradictions between U.S. aggressors and soldiers of their accomplice and puppet armies are intensifying daily.

    British soldiers, recently captured by the Chinese People's Volunteers in the battle of Maryang-san northwest of Lianchuan, confessed that a saying is popular among British soldiers: "God is cursing the Americans." They use cursing the American authorities to dispel their pain. They curse when they cannot get fresh food; they curse when they are freezing cold and cannot get winter clothes; they curse when they sleep in the open; they curse when they are wounded or see their comrades killed; they curse when they are sick or think of their families and relatives. They curse Truman, they curse Ridgway, they curse Van Fleet, and they also curse the wicked American financial groups.

    When I visited this group of prisoners from the Scottish Borderers Regiment of the 28th Brigade of the British Commonwealth Division, they had just taken a bath and were sitting on the grass sunbathing. As soon as we started talking, they all cursed incessantly.

    William Martin, corporal and deputy squad leader of the tenth squad of the fourth company of the regiment, said first: "I curse the American aggression against Korea. What good is Korea to us British? The Americans have dragged the British into the water; British blood has been shed in vain! Thank God, let this shameful war of aggression end quickly!"

    Then, Gou Luotai·Paitelike, corporal and deputy squad leader of the first squad of the second company, stood up, waved his hand, and said: "The Americans are delaying the armistice negotiations, so that the ceasefire line issue cannot be quickly agreed upon, and we cannot go home for a while." Bo Tuoluo·Naidun, a rifleman from the ninth squad of the third company, cursed the vicious conspiracy of the American generals, who ordered British soldiers to be vanguards or shields for the American soldiers. He said: "At the beginning of this year, the American army suddenly fled to the south bank of the Han River, and the American generals put the British soldiers northwest of Uijeongbu to cover the American soldiers' escape; in April, when the Chinese and Korean armies launched a counterattack, the American generals drove the British soldiers to the front line of the Imjin River to be shields; during the autumn offensive, the British soldiers were again driven to Maryang-san as vanguards. Too many of our people have died."

    Eun, a sergeant squad leader of the fourth company, cursed the American Wall Street bosses, saying: "Our government is not competitive and cannot repay the debts it owes to the American financial lords. Those American financial lords are forcing our British soldiers to come to Korea to suffer. I am already forty years old, and I have seen too many American crimes. May God punish those wicked American financial lords!"

    Later, more and more people joined in the cursing. Some cursed that the U.S. soldiers were paid more than the British soldiers; they were selling their lives in the same way, but for two different prices; some cursed that the U.S. soldiers ate better than the British soldiers, and the U.S. soldiers chose the food first, and the inferior goods were left to the British soldiers; some cursed that the U.S. soldiers' clothes and equipment were better and more plentiful than those of the British soldiers. In short, these British prisoners felt that everything about them was inferior to that of the American aggressors.

    The fate of the Li Seung-man puppet army soldiers was even more miserable than that of the British soldiers. According to Park Jin-gam, Lee Jin-hwang, and more than ten other Li puppet army soldiers captured from the U.S. 3rd Division, Korean soldiers in the U.S. army were discriminated against and abused by the U.S. army. They carried ammunition, weapons, and stretchers for the American soldiers when marching; they cleaned guns and barracks for the American soldiers when they settled down; and the American soldiers drove them to the front to block bullets during combat. The American aggressors could beat them at will and did not give them food. Sometimes, the Li puppet army soldiers could not bear these insults and pulled out their bayonets to fight with the American soldiers.

    美军和帮凶军士兵间矛盾日深
    侵朝帮凶英军的被俘士兵诅咒杜鲁门和华尔街财阀
     【新华社朝鲜前线二十二日电】本社前线记者报道：美国侵略者及其帮凶和傀儡军队的士兵之间的矛盾正日益加深。
    最近在涟川西北马良山战斗中被中国人民志愿军俘掳的英军士兵供称：在英军士兵中间流行着这样一句话：“上帝在诅咒美国人”。他们以诅咒美国当局来排除痛苦。他们在吃不到新鲜食物的时候诅咒；在天寒受冻穿不上冬衣的时候诅咒；在露天睡觉的时候诅咒；在负伤或看到同伴们被打死的时候诅咒；在生病或想到家庭和亲人的时候诅咒。他们诅咒杜鲁门，诅咒李奇微，诅咒范佛里特，也诅咒万恶的美国财阀们。
    在我访问这一群英军联邦师第二十八旅苏格兰边防团的俘虏时，他们刚才洗过澡，坐在草地上晒太阳。我们一开始谈话，他们就个个滔滔不绝地诅咒起来。
    该团四连十排下士副班长威廉·马丁首先说：“我诅咒美国侵略朝鲜，朝鲜对我们英国人有什么好处呢？美国人把英国人拖下了水；英国人的血流得太冤枉了！谢天谢地，快快结束这场可耻的侵略战争吧！”
    接着，二连一排下士副班长苟洛台·派脱立克站起来用手一挥说：“美国人拖延停战谈判，使停火线问题不能迅速达成协议，使我们一时回不了家。”三连九班步枪手柏脱罗·乃顿诅咒美国将军的毒辣阴谋，叫英国兵替美国兵打先锋或挡头阵。他说：“今年年初美国军队一下子逃到汉江南岸去，美国将军把英国兵放在议政府西北掩护美国兵逃跑；四月间中国和朝鲜军队举行反击，美国将军又把英国兵赶到临津江前线挡头阵；秋季攻势中英国兵又被赶着向马良山打先锋，我们的人实在死得太多了。”
    四连中士班长尤恩诅咒美国华尔街老板说：“我们的政府不争气，欠了美国财主们的钱还不起债。那些美国财主们逼着我们英国兵到朝鲜来受苦受罪。我已经四十岁了，看见美国犯罪作恶的事实在太多了，愿上帝惩罚那些万恶的美国大财主吧！”
    后来参加诅咒的人愈来愈多。有的诅咒美军士兵比英军士兵薪饷拿得多，同样卖命，两种价钱；有的诅咒美军吃的比英军好，粮食到了先由美军挑选，次货留给英军；有的诅咒美军衣服装备都比英军要好要多。总之，这些英国俘虏认为自己的一切都不如美国侵略军。
    李承晚傀儡军士兵的命运要比英军士兵更为悲惨。据被俘的美军第三师中的李伪军士兵朴金监、李金煌等十多人谈：在美军中的朝鲜籍士兵受到美军的歧视和虐待。他们在行军时替美国兵扛弹药、武器和抬担架；住下来就替美国兵擦枪和打扫营房；在作战时，美国兵把他们赶到最前面去挡子弹。美国侵略军可以任意殴打他们，不给他们吃饭。有时，李伪军士兵实在忍受不了这些侮辱便拔出刺刀跟美国士兵殴斗。
