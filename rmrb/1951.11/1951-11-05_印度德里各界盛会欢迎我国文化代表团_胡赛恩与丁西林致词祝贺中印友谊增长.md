Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, 4th: A grand gathering was held by people from all walks of life in Delhi, India, on the afternoon of October 30th to welcome the Chinese cultural delegation visiting India. The meeting was hosted by the Asian Relations Organization and the Indian Council of World Affairs. More than a thousand people attended the meeting, including senior Indian government officials, educators, artists, and foreign diplomatic officials in India.

The meeting began with the national anthems of India and China. Dr. Hussein, Vice-Chancellor of Aligarh University and chairman of the meeting, delivered a speech first, welcoming the Chinese cultural delegation. Dr. Hussein said that the visit of the Chinese cultural delegation to India signifies "the beginning of a new era of friendship and cooperation" between the people of China and India. He said: "The situation in Asia is changing dramatically. Imperialism has set insurmountable obstacles between us; but now this obstacle has been eliminated. I feel that our past close relations seem only a small beginning to the great cooperation of the future." He said: "I sincerely hope that our two countries will establish direct cultural and economic ties."

Dr. Hussein then recounted the warm reception given by the Chinese people to the Indian goodwill delegation to China, which was invited to attend the National Day celebrations of the People's Republic of China. He said that this will be the beginning of more mutually beneficial cooperation between the people of China and India, and the people of the two countries will continue to work together for peace. He said: "I firmly believe that your trip to India will help strengthen our mutual understanding and care; this understanding and care is the most reliable guarantee of peace."

Dr. Hussein then spoke of the outstanding achievements of the People's Republic of China. He said: "We know the great suffering your country has gone through, and we watch with sincere admiration your heroic efforts to build a new China. Your efforts have been fruitful. The People's Government has united nearly 500 million people, forming an unprecedented great unity of the Chinese people. After full and free discussion, you have formulated the 'Common Program,' and your loyalty to the purpose of this program guarantees its success. The people of India wish you all the best in achieving your desired goals."

Dr. Hussein concluded by saying that during the Chinese cultural delegation's visit to India, "wherever you go, you will see great expressions of friendship, which have deep historical roots and are the most realistic facts of modern life."

Ding Xilin, the head of the Chinese cultural delegation, replied, "Historically, the friendship between the people of China and India has always been good and memorable. In the current volatile era, we live together on one continent, and we both expect the development and prosperity of our two peoples and the peace and security of our continent. To achieve this goal, we must strengthen the traditional friendship between our two countries; and the solid foundation provided by history will help strengthen this friendship. In the past two years, the satisfactory development of our diplomatic and economic relations is enough to prove the initial growth of this friendship. Now, the task of this delegation is to promote this friendship through cultural exchanges. We hope that our delegation will be able to accomplish this task."

Whenever the speakers mentioned the friendship between the people of China and India, the participants responded with warm cheers.

    【新华社四日讯】德里消息：德里各界人士在十月三十日下午举行盛大集会，欢迎访问印度的中国文化代表团。大会由亚洲关系协会和印度世界事务委员会主持。出席大会的有印度政府高级官员、教育家、艺术家，以及各国驻印度的外交官员等一千余人。
    大会在印中两国国歌声中开始。大会主席、阿里加大学副校长胡赛恩博士首先致词，欢迎中国文化代表团。胡赛恩博士说：中国文化代表团的访问印度，意味着中印两国人民间“新的友谊和合作时代的开始”。他说：“亚洲的形势正在急剧地改变。帝国主义曾在我们之间设下了不可逾越的障碍；但是，现在这种障碍已经消除了。我觉得，我们过去的密切关系，似乎仅是未来的伟大合作的一个小小开端。”他说：“我诚恳地希望我们两国建立直接的文化和经济联系。”
    胡赛恩博士接着叙述应邀参加中华人民共和国国庆典礼的印度亲善访华团受到中国人民热烈招待。他说，这将是中印两国人民进行更多的彼此有利的合作的开端，两国人民将继续在一起争取和平。他说：“我深信，你们这次的印度之行，将有助于加强我们彼此间的了解和相互的关怀；这种了解和关怀是和平的最可靠的保证。”
    胡赛恩博士接着谈到中华人民共和国的杰出成就。他说：“我们知道你们国家所经过的巨大苦难，我们怀着诚恳的钦佩心情，注视着你们建设新中国的英雄努力。你们的努力已经收到了成果。人民政府团结了近五万万人民，形成了中国人民空前未有的大团结。你们经过充分和自由的讨论，制订了‘共同纲领’，你们对这纲领宗旨的忠诚，保证了这个纲领的成功。印度人民谨祝你们达成你们所希望的目标。”
    胡赛恩博士最后说：中国文化代表团在访印期间，“无论到什么地方都将看到伟大的友爱的表现，这种友爱是有其历史的深远根源的，也是现代生活中最现实的事实”。
    中国文化代表团团长丁西林致答词说：“在历史上，中印两国人民的友谊一向是良好而值得念念不忘的。在目前动荡不定的时代，我们共同生活在一个大陆上，我们都期望着我们两国人民的发展和昌盛以及我们大陆的和平和安全。要达到这个目的，就必须加强我们两国间的传统友谊；而历史所提供的坚固基础将有助于加强这种友谊。过去两年内，我们的外交与经济关系令人满意的发展，足以证明这种友谊的初步增长。现在，这个代表团的任务正是通过文化交流促进这种友谊。我们希望我们的代表团能够完成这个任务。”
    每当发言者提到中印两国人民的友谊时，与会者都报以热烈的欢呼。
