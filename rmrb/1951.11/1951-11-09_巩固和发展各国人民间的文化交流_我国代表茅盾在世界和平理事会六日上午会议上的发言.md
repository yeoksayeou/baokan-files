    Consolidate and Develop Cultural Exchanges Between People of All Countries
    -- Speech by Chinese Representative Mao Dun at the Morning Session of the World Peace Council
    Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends who are fighting for the cause of peace!

    This meeting, which further raises the question of how to consolidate and develop cultural exchanges between people of all countries, is of great significance for safeguarding world peace. The people of the whole world have a common ideal: to live, work, and create together in a peaceful and democratic family. Therefore, the people have the right to demand broad cultural exchanges based on the principles of equality and friendship, and have the right to oppose those who attempt to build barriers between people, expand blockades, and undermine friendship.

    We, the Chinese people, cherish and love the excellent cultures of all peoples of the world, just as we cherish and love our own national culture. In the two years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, especially in the past year, while we Chinese people have been healing the wounds caused by past wars, we have also been resisting America and aiding Korea to defend our homes and country. At the same time, we are carrying out peaceful construction with great enthusiasm and confidence. From the perspective of cultural construction, we can cite a few figures to show the rapid progress of general achievements. For example, compared with 1936 (before the War of Resistance Against Japan), primary schools for national basic education have increased by 37 percent, and the number of students has increased by more than 100 percent. From January to June this year, book publications reached 251 million copies, an increase of 164 percent over the same period last year. In terms of the film industry, urban audiences last year were 150 million, and in the first half of this year alone, they reached 110 million. The number of film projection teams has increased from 100 last year to 1,000, distributed in factories, mines, rural areas, and troops. The work of developing foreign cultural exchanges is also regarded as an important matter in peaceful construction and an indispensable work for dedicating ourselves to the peace movement, and thus has received unprecedented attention and support from the Chinese people. We sincerely agree with and support the resolutions of the Second World Peace Congress and the First Session of the World Peace Council on strengthening cultural relations, and have already begun to implement them.

    First of all, I would like to mention the exchange of cultural delegations and individuals, which is one of the main ways of cultural exchange between people of all countries. In the past two years, we have invited a total of 35 delegations from 16 different countries to visit, report, and perform in our country. At the same time, we have sent 35 delegations to 9 different countries. The visiting delegations include various categories such as music, drama, dance, sports, and acrobatics. Among the representatives invited to our country are outstanding peace fighters, famous scientists, artists, and leaders of people's organizations. For example, among the foreign guests recently invited to our country to participate in the National Day celebrations, in addition to representatives from the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, there were also representatives from Britain, India, Burma, Pakistan, Indonesia, and other countries. For example, the famous Indian writer Anand, the well-known Pakistani journalist Iftikharuddin, and the excellent Burmese peace fighters Thakin Lun, U Tun Min, and Ko Hla Win, who are present here today, were all distinguished guests of the Chinese people not long ago. People from all walks of life in our country warmly welcome them. The Chinese people will always extend a hand of friendship to honest and kind people from all over the world.

    Another important form of cultural exchange is the mutual organization of exhibitions, which are more mass-oriented activities, and we have done more of them. With the establishment of New China, in order to meet the requirements of many foreign friends, we have organized and are organizing "New China Exhibition," "Chinese Art Exhibition," "New China Exposition," and 14 exhibitions with different contents related to Dunhuang cultural relics, children, women, and youth activities, which have been sent or are being prepared to be sent to the Soviet Union, various parts of Europe, India, Burma, Pakistan and other places for exhibition. There are also 14 exhibitions related to various countries sent to our country and organized in our country. The vast number of workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and masses in our country have absorbed valuable knowledge and received rich education in these exhibitions. They wrote in the opinion book: "Our peaceful friends are all over the world."

    As for the translation and publication of famous works from various countries and the exchange and introduction of materials, undoubtedly, it is a regular work of cultural exchange. In the past two years, many famous works of our country have been translated into foreign languages, such as Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and "On Practice," which are very popular among the people of various countries; and many reports on the construction of our country in various aspects have also been translated into foreign languages. We have also translated many Western works, and some people have said that New China excludes Western culture. Now I can cite facts to prove that such a statement is a complete fabrication. The fact is that in the past two years, our country has translated and published (including reprinted) more than 1,100 kinds of Western literary works (only literary works), with a circulation of nearly 6 million copies, including classical and modern works from Western countries. Almost every Soviet work that has won the Stalin Prize has been translated into Chinese, and some books even have five or six translations. The hero martyr Fuchik's "Report from the Gallows," and the poems of Chilean poet Neruda and Turkish poet Hikmet, are all popular among the vast number of readers in our country. Recently, the German female writer Anna Seghers' "The Seventh Cross" and other works of the people's democratic countries will be published. In addition, we have translated and published Homer's epic, Dante's Divine Comedy, Cervantes' Don Quixote, works by Shakespeare, Scott, Swift, Byron, Shelley, Keats, Dickens, Hardy, Shaw and others, works by Hugo, Moliere, Balzac, Stendhal, Maupassant, Zola, Daudet, Anatole, France and others, works by Pushkin, Lermontov, Gogol, Tolstoy, Turgenev, Chekhov, Dostoevsky and others, works by Goethe, Schiller, Heine, Hauptmann, Thomas Mann and others, works by Whitman, Jack London, Dreiser, Mark Twain and others, Sienkiewicz's "Quo Vadis?", works by Ibsen and Strindberg, and Andersen's fairy tales. Among the classical masterpieces and modern works mentioned above, many have two or more translations. The introduction of classical masterpieces has also taken a step further, that is, to make it widely circulated, such as Dickens' "David Copperfield," which was recently completely translated into popular colloquial language. Serafimovich's "Iron Flood" and Ostrovsky's "How the Steel Was Tempered" and other works have popular abbreviated versions adapted to different cultural levels. Simonov's "Days and Nights" and Furmanov's "Chapayev" have been drawn into comic strips by artists, exclusively for children to read. As for the exchange of cultural materials, it is carried out in various forms and on an increasingly large scale, including regular magazines, newspapers, records, films, music scores, radio recordings, and special articles, etc.

    Regarding the screening of films, we also attach great importance to it, because it is also an important and good way of cultural exchange in safeguarding peace. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, we have screened a total of 143 films from the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, most of which are dubbed in Chinese, so that the Chinese people have strengthened their confidence in building their motherland. As for feature films and newsreels reflecting the face of New China, they are also constantly screened in various foreign countries as well as Britain, India, Burma and other places, and they are warmly welcomed and widely praised by the people of various countries.

    We have also introduced many scientific works, but we do not intend to list them one by one due to time constraints. But one point worth pointing out is that some countries now prohibit the import of scientific books into China. The purpose is obviously to impose a cultural blockade on China. It is worth pondering that these countries that prohibit the import of scientific books into China are also the countries that say that China excludes Western culture.

    Dear friends, based on our experience in the past two years, international cultural exchanges have not only improved the cultural level of our people, but also promoted the fraternal friendship between the people of all countries, which has played a significant role in safeguarding the cause of peace. Therefore, our Chinese delegation sincerely supports Mrs. Fiaher's report and hopes that the Council's Cultural Exchange Committee will work hard to realize it.

    巩固和发展各国人民间的文化交流
    ——我国代表茅盾在世界和平理事会六日上午会议上的发言诸位先生，诸位为和平事业而奋斗的亲爱的朋友！
    这一次会议，进一步地提出关于如何巩固和发展各国人民间的文化交流的问题，对于保卫世界和平是具有非常重大的意义的。全世界的人民有着共同的理想：在和平民主的大家庭中，大家共同生活、劳动和创造。因此，人民就有权在平等和友爱的原则下要求进行广泛的文化交流，就有权来反对那些企图在人民和人民之间建筑壁障、扩大封锁和破坏友谊的人。
    我们中国人民珍视喜爱世界各族人民的优秀文化，正像珍视喜爱自己的民族文化一样。在中华人民共和国建立以来的这两年中间，特别是最近一年以来，我们中国人民一方面要医治过去战争带给我们的创伤，一方面还要抗美援朝保家卫国，但同时我们也正抱着极大的热情和信心来大力进行和平建设事业。从文化建设方面来说，我们举出几个数目字，以表示一般成就的突飞猛进。例如，国民基础教育的小学，和一九三六年（抗日战争前）相比，学校增加了百分之三十七，学生增加了百分之一百强。书籍的出版，今年一月至六月已达二亿五千一百万册，较去年同期增加了百分之一百六十四。电影事业方面，去年城市观众为一亿五千万人，而今年上半年即已达一亿一千万。电影放映队已由去年的一百队增至一千队，分布于工厂、矿山、农村和部队中。而开展对外文化交流的工作，也被看作是和平建设中的重要事情，看作是致力和平运动不可缺少的工作，因而受到了我国人民空前的重视和支持。我们对于第二届世界和平大会和世界和平理事会第一届会议关于加强文化关系的决议，衷心地赞成与拥护，并且已经在开始执行。
    首先，我愿意提到作为各国人民间文化交流的主要方式之一的文化代表团体和个人的来往：在这两年中，我们一共邀请了三十五个属于十六个不同国家的代表团，来到我国观光、访问、报告和表演。同时，我们也派出了三十五个代表团到九个不同的国家去。在来往的代表团中包括着音乐、戏剧、舞蹈、体育、杂技、科学等各种类别。而在被请来我国的代表中，包括有出色的和平战士、著名的科学家、艺术家以及人民团体的领袖。像最近被邀请到我国参加国庆观礼的外宾中，除了苏联和各人民民主国家的代表外，还有英国、印度、缅甸、巴基斯坦、印尼等国的代表，譬如现在在座的印度名作家安纳德，巴基斯坦的著名新闻工作者伊夫提卡鲁丁，缅甸的优秀和平战士德钦伦、宇吞敏、哥拉温诸位先生，不久以前都曾是中国人民的贵宾。我们各界人民热烈地欢迎他们。中国人民永远向世界各国正直和善良的人们伸出友谊的手。
    文化交流的另一种重要的形式是互相组织展览会，这是比较带群众性的活动，我们作过的也比较多。随着新中国的成立，为满足许多外国朋友的要求，我们前后组织了以及正在组织“新中国展览”、“中国艺术展览”、“新中国博览会”、以及有关敦煌文物、儿童、妇女、青年活动等十四个内容不同的展览会，送到或准备送到苏联、欧洲各地、印度、缅甸、巴基斯坦等地展出。从其他各国派到我国以及在我国组织的有关各国的展览会也有十四个。我国广大的工人、农民、战士、学生及群众，在这些展览会中吸取了宝贵的知识，得到了丰富的教育。他们在意见簿上写着：“我们和平的朋友遍及全世界”。
    至于各国名著的翻译出版和资料的交换介绍，无疑地，更是文化交流的经常性的工作。两年来，我国名著译成外文者颇多，如毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”、“实践论”等极受各国人民的欢迎；我国各方面的建设报道，被译成外文者亦复不少。我们翻译西方作品也很多，有些人曾说新中国是排斥西方文化的，现在我可以举出事实来证明这样的说法是彻头彻尾的造谣。事实是：近二年来，我国所翻译的和出版的（包括重版）西方国家的文艺作品（光是文艺作品）就有一千一百余种，发行量将近六百万册，其中有西方国家古典的和现代的作品。苏联的作品差不多每部得过斯大林奖金的，都已译成中文，有的书甚至有五、六种译本。献身于和平事业的英雄烈士伏契克的“绞索套着脖子时的报告”、智利诗人聂鲁达和土耳其诗人希克梅特的诗篇，都受到我国广大读者的欢迎。最近将出版德国女作家安娜·西格斯的“第七个十字架”、以及其他人民民主国家的作品。此外我们翻译并出版的有荷马的史诗、但丁的神曲、西万提斯的吉诃德先生，有莎士比亚、斯各脱、斯惠夫特、拜伦、雪莱、济慈、狄更司、哈代、萧伯纳等人的作品，有雨果、莫利哀、巴尔扎克、斯拉白尔、莫泊桑、左拉、都德、阿那托尔、法朗士等人的作品，有普希金、莱蒙托夫、果戈理、老托尔斯泰、屠格涅夫、契柯夫、陀思退夫斯基等人的作品，有哥德、席勒、海涅、霍普特曼、托马斯·曼等人的作品，有惠特曼、杰克伦敦、德莱塞、马克吐温等人的作品，有显克微支的“你往何处去？”、易卜生和斯特林堡的作品，以及安徒生的童话。以上所举的古典名著和近代作品中，不少是有两种以上的译本的。古典名著的介绍也更进了一步，就是使它能普及地流传起来，如狄更司的“大卫·科波菲尔”，就是最近全部用流行口语译成的。绥拉菲莫维支的“铁流”和奥斯特洛夫斯基的“钢铁是怎样炼成的”等作品，都有适应不同文化程度的通俗的缩写本。西蒙诺夫的“日日夜夜”和富曼诺夫的“夏伯阳”，都被美术家绘成了连环画本，专供儿童阅读。至于文化资料的交换，则是采用各种形式而且是规模愈来愈大地进行的，包括有定期的杂志、报纸和唱片、影片、乐谱、广播录音以及特约专文等等。
    关于电影片的放映，我们也很重视，因为它在保卫和平方面也是文化交流的重要的良好方式之一。自从中华人民共和国成立到现在，我们一共放映了一百四十三部苏联及各人民民主国家的影片，绝大部分配有华语对白，使中国人民加强了建设祖国的信心。至于反映新中国面貌的故事片和新闻片，也不断在国外各地以及英国、印度、缅甸等地放映，它们都受到各国人民热烈的欢迎和广泛的称赏。
    在科学著作方面，我们也介绍了不少，现在因为时间关系我们不打算一一列举了。但是有一点值得指出来，这就是现在有些国家禁止科学书籍输入中国。其目的显然是想在文化方面也对中国加以封锁。值得玩味的是：这些禁止科学书籍输入中国的国家，也就正是说中国排斥西方文化的国家。
    亲爱的朋友们，我们根据两年来的经验，国际间的文化交流不仅提高了本国人民的文化水平，而且促进了各国人民间的兄弟友谊，这对于保卫和平事业是起了重大的作用的。因此，我们中国代表团竭诚拥护费雅贺夫人的报告，并希望理事会的文化交流委员会努力促其实现。    （新华社维也纳讯）
