Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 31st: Our front-line correspondent reports: Under the increasingly strong blows of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, Van Fleet's "Autumn Offensive" suffered an even greater defeat than the first round. The frantic offensive launched by the American aggressors in the east-central sector from the 13th, continued for eleven days until the 23rd. They only advanced a few kilometers south and southeast of Kimhwa after our army proactively redeployed, but paid a heavy price. To this day, the enemy forces are still blocked in the area south of Kimhwa.

　　In the past half-month, our army has conducted heroic and resourceful battles in the east-central sector, achieving brilliant victories by defeating many enemies with a small number of troops. In the five-kilometer stretch around Licheon-dong, southeast of Kimhwa, a certain unit of our army engaged in fierce battles with more than three regiments of enemy troops with a small force. The enemy forces, supported by more than sixty tanks and more than ten aircraft every day, fiercely attacked our position. Our army, with the assistance of powerful artillery fire, bravely fought back. When the enemy tanks advanced rashly, our howitzers, field guns, and anti-tank guns fired together, destroying the enemy tanks before they even reached the front line of our position. When enemy infantry swarmed forward, our army fired with machine guns, automatic rifles, and submachine guns, and threw groups of grenades into the enemy ranks, knocking down large numbers of enemies. After five days of hard fighting from the 13th to the 17th, this unit annihilated more than four thousand enemy troops in the area. On the 938.2-meter high ground between the Bukhan River and Mundung-ri, a certain unit of our army repelled seven assaults by two enemy battalions on the 17th, killing and wounding more than five hundred enemy troops while suffering only fifteen casualties ourselves. In addition to conducting strong blocking operations, our army constantly launched short and fierce counterattacks against the enemy forces. On the night of the 19th, a unit of our army, coordinated by strong artillery fire, stormed the 443-meter high ground and the high ground south of it, engaging in bayonet combat with the American aggressor troops, killing and wounding more than four hundred of them, and capturing fourteen machine guns, and more than twenty rifles and carbines. On the 26th, two companies of American troops were repelled in their attack on the Sataeri area. In this battle, a certain unit of our army killed and wounded more than one hundred enemy troops, suffering no casualties ourselves. On the same night, a certain unit of our army launched a counterattack against the enemy forces south of the 1089.6-meter high ground, and after fierce fighting until the next morning, occupied the area and killed and wounded a large number of enemies.

　　In the western sector, our army is also conducting strong blocking and counter-attacking operations. On the 23rd, two enemy battalions launched a fierce attack on the Hwangji Mountain position held by a certain unit of our army, launching nine consecutive assaults, all of which were repelled by our army, with more than three hundred casualties. On the night of the 24th, our army annihilated the bulk of the 1st Battalion of the 5th Regiment of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division in the Yujisan-ri area southeast of Saknyong after a day and night of fierce fighting.

　　敌“秋季攻势”第二回合遭到更大惨败
　　我军以少胜多重创敌军
    某部在五公里地段上五天歼敌四千余
    【新华社朝鲜前线三十一日电】本社前线记者报道：在中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军愈来愈坚强的打击下，范佛里特“秋季攻势”的第二回合遭到了比第一回合更大的惨败。美国侵略者于十三日起在中线东部发动的疯狂进攻，截至二十三日止的十一天中，仅在金城以南和东南，在我军主动转移后，才前进了几公里，但付出了惨重的代价。迄今敌军仍被阻于金城以南地区。
    在过去半月中，我军在中线东部进行了英勇机智的战斗，连日取得以少数部队战胜多数敌人的光辉胜利。在金城东南梨船洞周围五公里的地段上，我军某部以少数兵力与三个多团的敌军进行激烈的战斗。敌军每日在六十多辆战车、十多架飞机的配合下向我猛犯，我军在强大炮火的协助下奋勇迎击。当敌军坦克冒进时，我军榴弹炮、野炮、反坦克炮一齐开火，使敌军战车还没有到我军阵地前沿即被击毁。当敌军步兵蜂涌前来时，我军即以机关枪、自动步枪、冲锋枪一起射击，并将成群的手榴弹投向敌群，把大批敌人击倒。该部经十三日到十七日的五天奋战，歼灭了该地敌军四千余人。在北汉江到文登里之间的九三八点二高地上，我军某部于十七日击退敌人两个营的七次冲锋，杀伤敌军五百余名，而自己仅伤亡十五人。我军除进行坚强的阻击战外，并不断向敌军进行短促而猛烈的反击。十九日夜间，我军一部在强大炮火的配合下，一举冲上四四三高地及其以南高地，与美国侵略军进行白刃战，杀伤其四百余名，并缴获机关枪十四挺、步枪和卡宾枪二十余枝。二十六日，美军两个连向沙太里一带进攻被我击退。在这次战斗中，我军某部毙伤敌军一百多名，自己无一伤亡。同日晚上，我军某部向一○八九点六高地以南的敌军发起反击，激战到次晨攻占该地，并杀伤了大量敌人。
    在西线地区，我军也进行着坚强的阻击战与反击战。二十三日，敌军两个营向我军某部据守的黄鸡山阵地猛攻，连续冲锋九次，均被我军击退，伤亡三百多名。二十四日晚，我军在朔宁东南鱼积山里附近地区经一昼夜奋战，歼灭美军第一骑兵师第五团第一营的大部。
