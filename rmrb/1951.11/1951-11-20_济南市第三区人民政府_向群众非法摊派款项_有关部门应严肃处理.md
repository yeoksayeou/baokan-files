　　The Third District People's Government of Jinan City
    Illegally Extorts Money from the Masses; Relevant Departments Should Deal with It Seriously
    Comrade Editor: The Third District People's Government of Jinan City exhibits serious extravagance and waste, and unauthorized fundraising from the masses and other disorganized and undisciplined phenomena. This is primarily manifested in their lack of concern for the people's lives, their disregard for the people's actual difficulties, and their arbitrary increase of the people's burden without seeking instructions or reporting. For example, they have arbitrarily used the District Consultative Committee to mobilize the masses to donate money for education, initially deciding to raise 300 million yuan, and the tea industry has already begun to arrange for the apportionment of funds. In order to express sympathy to the laborers controlling the Yellow River and dredging the Xiaoqing River, they raised 9 million yuan in donations, depositing the remaining 2 million yuan with the private merchant Yi Xing Match Factory for interest, completely violating the positive significance of the sympathy donations. During the Qilu University donation charity performance, the district allocated 3 million yuan worth of theater tickets, forcing the masses to pay to see the show, which caused dissatisfaction among the people. Recently, they have arbitrarily planned to raise 250 million yuan in donations to establish a Sino-Western joint clinic.
    Secondly, there is extravagance and waste, and a large number of gifts are collected in inappropriate ways. When the district convened the first session of the first District People's Congress, it arbitrarily collected congratulatory gifts from the masses (including cash and a large number of consumables) totaling more than 80 million yuan. The source of these cash and items was mainly through written requests. The official letter sent to various units stated: "...The meeting is of great significance. If you would like to give gifts, please send them to this committee (Representative Meeting Preparatory Committee) before June 12th..." In addition, representative candidates and street committees initiated the apportionment and fundraising, ranging from several thousand to several hundred yuan per household.
    The district did not ask for instructions from higher authorities beforehand for all the above donations, nor did it report afterwards. This serious act of being unorganized and undisciplined has reached an intolerable level. However, the Jinan Municipal People's Government only gave the Third District People's Government a severe criticism and a circular of demerit, which I think is not appropriate enough. I suggest that the relevant leading departments further investigate in depth, impose disciplinary sanctions according to the seriousness of the circumstances, and publicly publish the results of the handling in the newspaper.

### 济南市第三区人民政府  向群众非法摊派款项  有关部门应严肃处理

　　济南市第三区人民政府
    向群众非法摊派款项
    有关部门应严肃处理
    编辑同志：济南市第三区人民政府存在着严重的铺张浪费，擅自向群众募集捐款等无组织无纪律的现象。这种现象，首先表现在他们不关心群众生活、不照顾群众实际困难、不经请示报告，随便加重群众的负担。如擅自通过区协商委员会动员群众捐款兴学，初步决定筹款三亿元，茶叶业已开始布置摊派款项。为了慰问治黄和疏浚小清河的民工，曾前后募集捐款九百万元，把剩余的二百余万元存于私商伊兴火柴厂生息，完全违背了慰问捐款的积极意义。齐鲁大学捐献义演时，该区曾代为摊派三百万元的戏票，强迫群众拿钱看戏，引起群众不满。最近又擅自预计募集捐款二亿五千万元，成立中西联合诊疗所。
    其次是铺张浪费，以不当的方式大批收取贺礼。该区在召开第一届第一次各界人民代表会议时，即擅自向群众收集贺礼（包括现金和大批消耗物品）共计八千余万元。这些现款和物品的来源，以函索为主。在向各单位发出的公函上写着：“……会议意义重大，如蒙惠赐送礼，请于六月十二日前送交本会（代表会议筹备委员会）……”。此外，是由代表候选人、街道委员会发起摊派募捐的，每户几千、几百不等。
    上述各种捐款，该区事先均未向上级请示，事后也没作报告。这种严重的无组织无纪律行为，已达到令人不能容忍的程度。但济南市人民政府仅予该区人民政府以严厉批评和通报处分，我认为这是不够适当的。我建议有关领导部门，进一步深入调查，依据情节轻重予以纪律处分，并将处理结果在报纸上公开发表。　韩延庆
