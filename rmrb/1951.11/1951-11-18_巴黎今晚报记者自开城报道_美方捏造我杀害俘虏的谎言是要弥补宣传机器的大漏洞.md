　　Paris Tonight reporter reports from Kaesong
    The US fabrication of the lie that I killed prisoners is to make up for a big loophole in the propaganda machine
    [Xinhua News Agency, 17th] Paris Tonight reporter Béquet reported from Kaesong on the 16th: The Americans' loss of credibility and fickleness in the Panmunjom meeting tents has made them embarrassed to the point of having nowhere to hide. They have to seek "reinforcements" to regain the initiative in propaganda. While the American reporters' circus master Nackord is training a group of unmotivated characters in Tokyo, a new figure has emerged, telling lies bigger and louder than Nackord. This is Hanley, who has repeatedly falsely accused the Korean and Chinese sides of "slaughtering" American prisoners. It is intriguing that Hanley came here from Washington a week ago. Ridgway Headquarters hypocritically denies having authorized the publication of such news, but it is said that all these messages have been checked and allowed to be published. If this is not the case, then Ridgway Headquarters must have given special convenience for the release of this news. Hanley's slanderous rumors are comparable to the shameful bombing and strafing incident on August 22, which Ridgway Headquarters also denied. On August 22, the negotiations between the two sides reached a point where the Americans could not but overturn their own demands if they did not reach an agreement on the demarcation line. Today in Panmunjom, despite the best efforts of Nackord and his team, the truth about the Americans' fickleness and delaying of negotiations has still leaked out. At this time, an incident needs to be created, and it is very necessary. The news itself is absurd and completely slanderous, and it is simply not worth commenting on. The fact is that there is only one type of person who is massacred after being captured by the Korean and Chinese sides: those UN POWs who are bombed and strafed by American planes. In the past few weeks, more than a thousand American and British prisoners have signed protests against the recent bombing and strafing of prisoner-of-war camps by American planes. The fact is that the Korean and Chinese sides had to remove the huge signs indicating the location of the prisoner-of-war camps, because this would only attract American bombers. For the safety of the prisoners, they had to be moved to small villages far away from military targets. However, as in other parts of Korea, even these small villages are targets of American aircraft bombing and strafing. Thousands of American and British prisoners have proven that they have received excellent treatment and that the Korean and Chinese nurses have taken meticulous care of their injuries, while the American planes that injured them are still circling overhead. UN reporters recently told me in Panmunjom that they found their own wounded soldiers on the front lines, their wounds had been bandaged by Korean and Chinese doctors, and they had been placed in safe trenches before being sent back to UN positions. The Chinese People's Volunteers' humane treatment of prisoners is rare in the world. But the Americans need to fabricate this lie to distract people from the fact that they are bringing the negotiations to the brink of collapse when all the issues that must be resolved to determine the vital demarcation line have been agreed upon. They need to fabricate this lie in order to stir up war hysteria in the United States and elsewhere—where people are clamoring for an end to the delay in negotiations and a swift peace. They need to fabricate this lie to intimidate their front-line troops and prevent them from surrendering en masse as the United States attempts new military adventures. They need Hanley's lie to make up for the many loopholes in the propaganda machine, loopholes caused by their own fickleness.

    美方捏造我杀害俘虏的谎言是要弥补宣传机器的大漏洞
    【新华社十七日讯】巴黎今晚报记者贝却敌十六日自开城报道：美国人在板门店会议帐篷里的信誉扫地和反复无常，已经使得他们自己窘得无地自容了。他们不得不求“救兵”，来重新取得宣传上的主动。当美国记者们的马戏班主纳科斯正在东京训练一批不卖力的角色的时候，一个新人物出台了，谎撒得比纳科斯还要大，还要响。这就是屡次诬蔑朝中方面“屠杀”美国俘虏的汉莱。汉莱在一个星期以前从华盛顿来到这里，这件事是耐人寻味的。李奇微总部虚伪地不承认曾经授权发表这样的消息，可是据说，所有这些消息都是经过检查被允许发表的。如果不是这样，那末李奇微总部对于这种新闻的发布，一定曾经给予特别的便利。汉莱的诽谤谰言是可以和可耻的八月二十二日轰炸扫射事件并驾齐驱的，那一次李奇微总部也曾否认过。八月二十二日，双方代表的谈判到了这样一个地步，美国人要想不达成分界线的协议，就不能不推翻他们自己的要求。今天在板门店，尽管纳科斯和他的班子克尽职责，美国人反复无常和拖延谈判的事实真相还是渗透出去了。这时，就需要制造一个事件，而且非常需要。这个消息本身是荒唐无稽、全属诬蔑性质的，简直值不得加以评论。事实是，只有一种人是在被朝中方面俘虏以后遭到屠杀的：就是那些遭到美国方面的飞机的轰炸和扫射的联合国军战俘们。过去几星期，有一千余名美英俘虏签名抗议美机最近一次轰炸和扫射俘虏营的行为。事实是，朝中方面不得不把那些标明俘虏营所在地的巨型标志摘掉，因为这只会引来美国的轰炸机。为了俘虏们的安全，不得不把他们移到离开军事目标很远的小村庄去。但是，和朝鲜其他地方的情形一样，甚至这些小村庄也是美国飞机的炸射目标。几千美英战俘证明他们受到了极好的待遇，证明朝鲜和中国的看护士们对于他们的伤照料备至，而这时炸伤他们的美国飞机却仍然在上空盘旋。联合国方面的记者们最近在板门店告诉我说，他们在前线发现了他们自己的伤兵，伤口已经被朝中方面的医生包扎好，并且被置放在安全壕里面，然后被送回联合国军的阵地来。中国人民志愿军对于俘虏的人道待遇是世间少有的。但是美国人需要捏造这个谎言，使人们不注意到这件事实：当着为了确定极为重要的分界线所必须解决的一切问题都已取得协议的时候，他们却把谈判拖到险些破裂的岌岌可危的地步。他们需要捏造这个谎言，以便在美国国内和其他地方——这些地方的人民正大声疾呼地要求停止拖延谈判和迅速实现和平——以煽起战争歇斯的里。他们需要捏造这个谎言来恐吓他们的前线部队，防止他们在美国尝试新的军事冒险时集体投降。他们需要汉莱的这个谎言来弥补宣传机器的很多漏洞，这些漏洞是他们自己的反复无常造成的。
