	Errors in the Explanation of “Pocket Latest World National Fine Map” Should be Corrected

	Comrade Editor: "Pocket Latest World National Fine Map" (compiled by Jin Qingyu, Yaguang Cartography Society, sixth edition, January 1951), is still a relatively good map today. Its advantages include comparing the peace and democracy camp with the imperialist camp, and focusing on introducing the people's democratic countries led by the Soviet Union. However, there are also many errors in the explanation. For example: The explanation for Figure 25, the African Continent, states: "The current situation in Africa is that only Egypt, Abyssinia, Libya and other countries rely on the support of Britain and the United States to barely maintain their independence." This is too puzzling! As everyone knows, the main reason why Africa only has three "barely independent" countries is the result of the invasion and annexation of African countries by British and American imperialists; at the same time, the main reason why these three countries can "barely maintain their independence" is the persistent struggle of the people of these three countries, and not at all because of "British and American support." Regarding this point, we only need to look at the facts of the frantic plunder and massacre of the Egyptian people by British and American imperialists, and the Egyptian people's continued strikes against British and American imperialists, to understand this clearly, right?

	The explanation for Figure 23, the Republic of Finland, states: "Finland is a newly emerging new democratic country after the Second World War... Finland was an anti-Soviet and anti-democratic country before the Second World War, until the Soviet army entered Helsinki in 1944, and the anti-Nazi forces of the Finnish people became increasingly powerful, it began to move towards democracy. The coalition government was established in 1948, left-wing parties rose, relations with the Soviet Union improved, and it transitioned into a new democratic country." This is also very problematic. Why doesn't the compiler say that the Soviet army entered Finland to eliminate the German bandits, but vaguely says it "occupied" Finland? Why portray Finland as "transitioning into a new democratic country"? Furthermore, the explanation for Figure 18, the German Democratic Republic, also has similar errors:

	"In 1949, the German Democratic Republic was established in the Soviet occupation zone of East Germany, and was in opposition to the British, American, and French merged occupation zone of West Germany." This seems to suggest that the division of Germany and the opposition between East and West Germany are due to the establishment of the German Democratic Republic in the "Soviet occupation zone," which is ridiculous!

	I hope that Yaguang Cartography Society will make thorough corrections when the map is republished. 		Wang Chang

### “袖珍最新世界分国精图”解说有错误应作订正

    “袖珍最新世界分国精图”解说有错误应作订正
    编辑同志：“袖珍最新世界分国精图”（金擎宇编纂、亚光舆地学社一九五一年一月第六版），在今天说来，还是一本较好的地图。如将和平民主阵营和帝国主义阵营加以对比，并着重介绍以苏联为首的人民民主国家等，都是它的优点。但解说中也发生了不少错误。例如：第二十五图阿非利加洲的解说中说：“非洲的现势仅埃及、阿比西尼亚、利比亚等国靠英、美的支持，勉强独立。”这就太费解了！众所周知，非洲之所以只有三个“勉强独立”的国家，主要就是因为英、美帝国主义者对非洲各国进行侵略并吞的结果；同时，这三个国家之所以能够“勉强独立”，主要的原因就是这三国人民的坚持斗争，而决不是什么“英、美的支持”。关于这一点，我们只要看一看今天英、美帝国主义者合伙对埃及人民进行疯狂的掠夺和屠杀，以及埃及人民再接再厉予英、美帝国主义者以打击的事实，不就可以了然了吗？
    第二十三图芬兰共和国的解说中说：“芬兰是在第二次大战后新生的新民主国家……芬兰在第二次大战前，原是一个反苏反民主国家，直至一九四四年苏军进占赫尔新基，以及芬兰人民反纳粹力量的日趋强大，才开始走向民主。一九四八年联合政府成立，左翼政党抬头，与苏联关系增进，才过渡为一个新民主国家。”这也是大有问题的。编纂者为什么不说苏军之进入芬兰是为了歼灭德寇，而却含糊其词地说是“进占”芬兰呢？为什么要把芬兰说成是“过渡为一个新民主国家”呢？还有，第十八图德意志民主共和国的解说，也有类似的错误：
    “一九四九年东德的苏占领区成立了德意志民主共和国，和西德的英美法合并占领区成对立状态。”这好像是说，德国之分裂，东德和西德的对立，都是因为“苏占区”成立了德意志民主共和国，岂非可笑！
    希望亚光舆地学社在该图再版时，作彻底的订正。    王昌
