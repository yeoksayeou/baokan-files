    In the streets of Fuyuan County, Xinjiang Province, people often see crowds surrounding a propagandist, listening to him. Sometimes the propagandist explains things with newspapers and pictures in hand, and sometimes he plays musical instruments, singing self-composed tunes and clapper talks. He sometimes gets so sweaty and hoarse that his voice becomes a bit hoarse. People still want to listen after hearing it and stay there, unwilling to leave. This propagandist is He Shanting, the curator of the Fuyuan County People's Education Center, whom the masses affectionately call "Old He."
    He Shanting suffered all kinds of torments in the old society. He worked as a clerk in a company, as a weaver, and fled famine. He hated the old society and therefore loved the new China even more. He wanted to make the masses aware of the loveliness of the new China, so he actively carried out propaganda work. He carried out propaganda at various mass gatherings, on the Islamic "Juma Day," and when the masses held weddings and celebrations. He learned propaganda methods such as composing clapper talks, singing tunes, and telling stories to the accompaniment of a drum. He saw that some people did not understand the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign, and some thought that giving a little money was enough. Based on these situations, Old He composed a clapper talk saying: "Farmers should increase production, engage in deep plowing and careful cultivation; prevent various disasters and droughts early, and strive for bumper harvests to be models. Herdsmen should develop animal husbandry, and resolve disputes over pasture division; young animals cannot be slaughtered casually, and both people and animals should prosper. ... Patriotic covenants are all signed, and land rent reduction should be completed to free ourselves; everyone has a share in protecting the family and defending the country, and everyone should resist America and aid Korea."
    He Shanting is very patient in carrying out propaganda to the masses. In the beginning, some imams of mosques did not care much about national affairs. He tried to approach them often, using various examples from life to enlighten their patriotic thoughts. Once, a man named Ding Wantai walked alone for a night after returning from the countryside. Old He said to him: Could you walk alone for a night in the past? Could you sleep with the door open at night? These are all the benefits brought by the Communist Party. To preserve such a good life, we must resist America and aid Korea. When he first went to the temples to carry out propaganda, some imams were unwelcome, but now literacy classes have also started in the temples. Under Old He's constant persuasion, even Yuan, an 80-year-old, and Cao Erxi, a 70-year-old, who were the most superstitious and backward in the city, were willing to go to the People's Education Center to read books and newspapers.
    Old He loves the masses and likes to be close to them. He said, "When I walk down the street, I feel that all the people on the street are like my relatives!"
    The People's Education Center had financial difficulties. In order to meet the masses' demand for reading books and newspapers, Old He wrote letters to major bookstores, groups, and schools across the country, and received many books donated by them. The first article of Old He's patriotic covenant reads: "Under the principle of not asking the government for money, schools and groups in urban and rural areas should always have mobile reading books to read."
    He Shanting, a good propagandist of the masses and curator of the People's Education Center in Fuyuan County, Xinjiang, is educating the masses to love the new China in various ways. (Attached picture)

    群众的好宣传员何善亭
    春生
    在新疆省孚远县城里街道上，人们经常看到很多人围着一个宣传员在那里听宣传。宣传员有时拿着报纸和图画向大家讲解，有时敲打着乐器说唱自编的曲子和快板。他有时累得满头大汗，嗓子都有些哑了。人们听了还想听，围在那里不肯走。这个宣传员就是孚远县人民教育馆馆长何善亭，群众都亲热地叫他“老何”。
    何善亭在旧社会曾受尽了折磨。他当过公司的小职员，当过织布工人，出外逃过荒。他恨透了旧社会，也就更懂得热爱新中国。他要让群众都认识到新中国的可爱，因此，他积极地进行宣传工作。他在各种群众集会上，在伊斯兰教的“主玛日”和群众办婚喜事的时候，都向群众进行宣传。他学会编快板、唱曲子、说大鼓等宣传方式。他见到有些群众对抗美援朝不了解，有的人以为出点钱就算抗美援朝了。根据这些情况，老何就编了快板说：“农民应当多增产，深耕细作比着干；各种灾旱早防备，争取丰收当模范。牧民畜牧要发展，划分草场纠纷消灭完；幼畜不能随便杀，人畜两旺爱护当先。…爱国公约都订好，完成减租把身翻；保家卫国都有份，人人抗美援朝鲜。”
    老何向群众进行宣传是非常耐心的。开始，有些清真寺的阿訇不大关心国家的事情。他就想法经常接近他们，举出各种生活实例启发他们的爱国思想。有一次有个叫丁万泰的，下乡回来单身走了一夜路，老何就对他说：过去能不能单身人走一夜路？晚上能不能开着门睡觉？这都是共产党带来的好处。要保住这样的好日子，就要抗美援朝。开始他到寺坊去宣传，有些阿訇表示不欢迎，但是现在寺坊里也搞起识字班来了。在老何不断劝说下，连城里最迷信、落后的八十岁的袁老头和七十多岁的曹尔玺老汉，也都愿意到人民教育馆去看书报了。
    老何热爱群众，喜欢接近群众，他说：“我在大街上走一趟，觉得全街的群众都像我的亲人一样！”
    人民教育馆的经费困难，老何为着满足群众阅读书报的要求，就向全国各大书店、团体、学校写信，得到了不少他们赠送的书籍。老何的爱国公约头一条写着：“在不要政府出钱的原则下，要使城乡学校、团体经常有流动阅览的书籍看。”
    群众的好宣传员、新疆孚远县人民教育馆馆长何善亭，就是这样用各种办法教育群众热爱新中国的。（附图片）
