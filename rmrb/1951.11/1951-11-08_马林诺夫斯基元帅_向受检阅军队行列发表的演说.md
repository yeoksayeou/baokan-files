Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 7th: TASS reported that Marshal Malinovsky delivered the following speech to the troops under review in Red Square on November 7, 1951, the thirty-fourth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution:

    Comrades soldiers and non-commissioned officers of the Army and Navy! Comrades officers, colonels, and generals of the Army and Navy! The working people of the Soviet Union! Foreign friends who have come to participate in the festival!

    On behalf of and on the order of the Soviet Government and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolshevik), I extend my greetings and congratulations to you on this great thirty-fourth anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution.

    The Soviet people are celebrating the glorious October Revolution Day with the brilliant victories of our country in all aspects of political and economic life.

    The Soviet people have completed the post-war five-year plan ahead of schedule, and this year have achieved new successes in implementing the national economic plan.

    The workers, collective farm peasants, and intellectuals of the Soviet Union are realizing Stalin's plan for transforming nature with their selfless labor, building the world's largest hydroelectric power stations and canals, and laying the material and technical foundations for a communist society.

    With the steady progress of the Soviet national economy, Soviet culture, science, and art are further developing, and the lives of the Soviet working people are improving.

    All the achievements of our heroic people in building communism should be attributed to the wise leadership of the Bolshevik Party, to our leader and teacher, Comrade Stalin.

    The brilliant victories of the Soviet people are an inspiring example for the working people of the people's democratic countries who are victoriously building socialism.

    The Soviet Union, engaged in constructive labor, consistently and firmly implements the Leninist-Stalinist policy aimed at strengthening peace and international cooperation.

    The peace-loving foreign policy of the Soviet state is in line with the fundamental interests of hundreds of millions of working people in all countries of the world.

    The policy of the ruling circles of the United States is completely different; it is a policy of aggression. The purpose of this policy is to enable American monopoly capital to dominate the people of other countries, plunder the working people, and lower their living standards.

    The ruling circles of the United States and their accomplices in the North Atlantic Group are using the clamor about the so-called war danger caused by the Soviet Union to cover up their aggressive policy. The intention of this fabrication is very obvious. The warmongers are trying to deceive the people and weaken their resistance to the policy of war and hunger.

    But the masses of the people will not let themselves be deceived by lies. They do not want the disaster of war to happen again and are fully determined to defeat the plans of the aggressors. With each passing day, they are increasingly convinced that the Soviet Union, which is implementing a peaceful construction plan, does not intend to attack the United States or any other country.

    As everyone knows, American imperialism, which launched a bandit war in Korea and brutally trampled on international agreements, is preparing for another world war. With this goal in mind, it is reviving the fascist army in West Germany, restoring militarism in Japan, and piecing together various aggressive blocs against the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries.

    Considering the current international situation, the Soviet people, who are highly conscious of their patriotic duty, are tirelessly strengthening their socialist motherland.

    The imperialists want to see our country weak and unarmed; they will not see it. If the Soviet people have to deal with the aggressors, they will deal with the aggressors fully armed.

    The armed forces of the Soviet state vigilantly defend peace and the security of our motherland.

    The soldiers of the Soviet Army and Navy unswervingly strive to master their military and political knowledge and improve the combat readiness of the army in every way.

    The Soviet people can fully trust their armed forces. These forces have been, are, and will be the reliable fortress of the Soviet state's interests.

    Celebrate the thirty-fourth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution!

    Long live the heroic Soviet people and their brave Armed Forces!

    Long live our beloved Soviet Government!

    Long live the great party of Lenin and Stalin—the inspirer and organizer of all the victories of the Soviet people!

    Glory to our beloved leader and teacher—the great Stalin!

    Hurrah!

    马林诺夫斯基元帅
    向受检阅军队行列发表的演说
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科七日电：马林诺夫斯基元帅于一九五一年十一月七日在红场向受检阅军队行列发表的演说全文如下：陆海军战士、士官同志们！陆海军尉官、校官、将军同志们！苏联的劳动人民！来此参加节日的外国友人们！
    我代表并奉苏联政府和苏联共产党（布尔什维克）中央委员会之命，在这伟大十月社会主义革命三十四周年的时候，向你们致敬并祝贺。
    苏联人民以我国在政治与经济生活的各方面的辉煌胜利，来庆祝光荣的十月革命节。
    苏联人民提前完成了战后五年计划，今年在实行国民经济计划方面又获得了新的成就。
    苏联的工人、集体农场的农民与知识分子，以他们的忘我劳动来实现改造自然的斯大林计划，建造世界最大水力发电站和运河，并且为共产主义社会奠立物质的与技术的基础。
    随着苏联国民经济的稳步前进，苏联的文化、科学与艺术正在进一步发展，苏联劳动人民的生活正在提高。
    我国英雄的人民在建设共产主义方面的一切成就，应该归功于布尔什维克党的明智领导，归功于我们的领袖和导师斯大林同志。
    苏联人民的辉煌胜利，对于正在胜利地建设着社会主义的人民民主国家的劳动人民，是一个令人鼓舞的榜样。
    进行建设性劳动的苏联，始终如一地坚定地执行着列宁—斯大林旨在加强和平和国际合作的政策。
    苏维埃国家的爱好和平的外交政策，符合于世界各国亿万劳动人民的根本利益。
    美国统治集团的政策完全不同，它的政策是侵略政策。这政策的目的是使美国垄断资本统治其他国家的人民，掠夺劳动人民，降低劳动人民的生活水准。
    美国统治集团及其在北大西洋集团里的同谋者，用关于所谓苏联引起了战争危险的叫嚣来掩盖他们的侵略政策。这种捏造的用意是很明显的。战争贩子力图欺骗人民，削弱人民对于战争和饥饿的政策的反抗。
    但人民群众不会让自己为谎言所欺骗。他们不愿意战争的灾害再度发生，有充分决心要打败侵略者的计划。每过一天，他们就愈加深信：实施着和平建设计划的苏联，并不打算进攻美国或任何其他国家。
    众所周知，在朝鲜发动了强盗战争和粗暴地践踏国际协定的美帝国主义，正在准备另一次世界大战。怀抱着这个目的，它正在西德使法西斯军队复活，在日本恢复军国主义，拼凑反对苏联、中华人民共和国和人民民主国家的各种侵略集团。
    考虑到目前的国际局势，对于他们的爱国义务有高度自觉的苏联人民，正在不倦地加强他们的社会主义祖国。
    帝国主义者想看见我们的国家孱弱和没有武装，他们是不会看到的。苏联人民如果不得不对付侵略者，他们将全副武装地对付侵略者。
    苏维埃国家的武装部队警觉地保卫着和平与我们祖国的安全。
    苏联的陆军和海军战士们坚持不渝地努力精通他们的军事和政治知识，并以各种方法提高军队的战斗准备。
    苏联人民可以完全信赖他们的武装部队。这些部队在过去、现在、和将来都是苏联国家利益的可靠堡垒。
    庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命三十四周年！
    英雄的苏联人民和他们勇敢的武装部队万岁！
    我们敬爱的苏联政府万岁！
    伟大的列宁和斯大林党——苏联人民一切胜利的鼓舞者和组织者万岁！
    光荣属于我们敬爱的领袖和导师——伟大的斯大林！
    乌拉！
