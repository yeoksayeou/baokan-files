Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, November 24th. A unit of the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet recently reached Shigatse City, the capital of Rear Tibet, and received a warm welcome from representatives of Tashilhunpo Monastery, local government officials, and monks and laypeople. The citizens were all dressed in new clothes and burned pine branches to express their warm welcome. When the troops passed by the mountains on the outskirts of the city, the Tibetan compatriots standing on the mountain to welcome them rushed down the mountain and shouted kindly to the PLA commanders and fighters: "The People's Liberation Army has worked hard." Tashilhunpo Monastery had sent people early on to set up a welcome tent beside the road five miles from the city. When the PLA arrived at the welcome tent, Kanchen (small Khenpo) Luo Yun, a representative of the monastery, extended his condolences to the PLA commanders and fighters. Peng Yun and Losang Zeye, the two Dzong officials stationed in Shigatse, paid their respects to the PLA commanders. In the evening, the troops camped near Gongjuelin on the outskirts of the city. Representatives from all walks of life in the local area sent large quantities of comfort items such as white flour, highland barley, eggs, sheep, firewood, and ghee to the campsite. After the commanders and fighters thanked the representatives, they politely explained the discipline of the People's Liberation Army and returned all the comfort items to the representatives.

    【新华社拉萨二十四日电】人民解放军进藏部队某部在日前到达后藏首府——日喀则城，受到了札什伦布寺代表、当地政府官员和僧俗人民的热烈欢迎。市民们都穿着新衣，并燃烧松枝，表示欢迎的盛意。当部队从城郊山边通过时，站在山头欢迎的藏胞们都涌下山来，向着解放军指挥员和战斗员亲切地喊：“解放军辛苦了。”札什伦布寺很早就派人在距城五里地的大道旁，搭起欢迎帐篷。解放军到达欢迎帐篷时，该寺代表堪穹（小堪布）罗云向解放军指挥员、战斗员致以慰问。驻日喀则的两个基宗（官名）彭云和洛桑泽也向解放军的指挥员致敬。傍晚，部队在市郊功觉林附近宿营。当地各界人民代表纷纷把白面、青稞、鸡蛋、羊、柴草、酥油等大批慰劳品送到宿营地。指挥员和战斗员向代表们表示谢意后，婉词说明解放军的纪律，把慰劳品都还给了代表。
