Xinhua News Agency, New York, 23rd Dispatch: The shameless lies fabricated by Ridgway Headquarters about the Korean and Chinese People's Armies "murdering prisoners" have also been exposed by American newspapers, as well as the talk and letters of American soldiers themselves.

    The "Chicago Daily News" published a Tokyo dispatch stating that the uproar about this matter is inconsistent with previous reports about the Korean People's Army's lenient treatment of prisoners. The dispatch said: "Prisoners who returned on their own or were released by the Chinese invariably recounted the lenient treatment of prisoners by the Chinese." The newspaper quoted some American soldiers and officers currently living in Chicago who had participated in many battles in Korea, and some had even been prisoners of the Korean People's Army. They all refuted the vicious instigation of Ridgway Headquarters. Sergeant William Pimberton told reporters: "I have seen more than once how the North Koreans sent wounded American soldiers to American trenches."
    The International Longshore and Warehouse Union's newspaper, "The Dispatcher," published a letter from Paul Schnurr, an American soldier captured by the Korean People's Army, to his parents. He wrote that he had been in good spirits since becoming a prisoner. ... He was surprised by the leniency of the Koreans and Chinese towards them there. He said he felt indignant that the American people had caused so much suffering to the Korean people.
    The "Phoenix Gazette" of Phoenix, Arizona, published a letter from Edward Corbey, an American soldier who was a prisoner at the third prisoner-of-war camp in Korea. Corbey wrote in his letter about the lenient treatment of prisoners by the prison camp authorities.

    美国报纸所载消息和信件
    驳倒了李奇微总部的谎话
    报道被俘美士兵受我方宽待情形
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十二日讯：李奇微总部捏造的所谓朝中人民军队“杀害俘虏”的无耻谎话，也被美国本国的报纸以及美国兵的谈话和信件揭破了。
    “芝加哥每日新闻”刊载东京电讯说：关于这个问题的吵嚷和以前关于朝鲜人民军宽待俘虏的报道，绝不相符。该电说：“自己回来的或者被中国人释放回来的俘虏，总是异口同声地叙述中国人宽待俘虏的情形。”该报引述了一些现住芝加哥的美国士兵和军官的话，他们曾经在朝鲜参加过许多战斗，有些人还当过朝鲜人民军的俘虏。他们全都反驳李奇微总部的恶毒挑拨。中士威廉·皮姆柏顿对记者说：“我不止一次看见北朝鲜人如何把受伤的美国兵送到美国的战壕。”
    国际码头与仓库工人工会的报纸“电讯报”刊载了被朝鲜人民军俘虏的美国兵保罗·施努尔给他的父母的一封信。他写道：他当俘虏以来，心情一直很好。……他在那里因为朝鲜人和中国人宽待他们而吃惊。他说：他想到美国人使朝鲜人民遭受这么大的苦难而感到愤慨。
    亚利桑那州费匿克斯城的“新闻报”刊载了在朝鲜第三号战俘营当俘虏的美国兵爱德华·寇贝的来信。寇贝在信中写到俘虏营当局宽待俘虏的情形。
