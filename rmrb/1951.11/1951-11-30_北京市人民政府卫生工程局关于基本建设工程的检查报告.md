The People's Daily published an editorial on June 16 this year entitled "Construction is Impossible Without Correct Engineering Design," and on June 19, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council issued instructions on inspecting basic construction. At that time, we did not give due importance to this issue. On June 18, the People's Daily published news about the failure of the sewer built by our bureau at the Beijing Paper Mill. Initially, we still attributed the responsibility to objective reasons. After instructions from higher authorities and our own self-criticism, we clarified the spirit of inspecting basic construction. In addition to reviewing the Beijing Paper Mill sewer problem, we conducted a comprehensive inspection of all projects starting in mid-July. During the inspection, the following problems were discovered.

	I. Design Aspects

	(1) Before engineering design, there was a lack of investigation and research, a lack of comprehensive and developmental perspectives, and designs were carried out in isolation and locally, resulting in significant losses. For example, before designing the Longxugou sewer project, we did not conduct sufficient investigation and research on the topography near Longxugou, and we did not conduct thorough and comprehensive research and calculations on the drainage area and flow rate. At that time, we only considered solving the drainage problem in the vicinity of Longxugou. After the sewer was completed, water still accumulated in the courtyards of some residents, so we had to add another sewer. Similarly, when constructing the Dongbianmen Inner East Bian Road sewer (double-hole square culvert) in 1950, the slope was designed to be only six per ten thousand. After completion, it was found that the distance between the sewer outlet downstream and the bottom of the South Moat was large, and the outlet could be lowered, and the slope could be increased. In this way, the same cross-section sewer could accommodate more flow. If the Dongbianmen Inner East Bian Road sewer had been built larger, with a steeper slope, and the old sewer inside Yongdingmen had been repaired and utilized, and the diameter of the Dongxiaoshi sewer line had been increased, the drainage problem in the entire Longxugou area could have been better solved. In 1950, when designing the Songlin Lock, only water diversion to the city was considered, and flood discharge was not taken into account. The lock hole was designed as three holes, but the upstream Sanchakou Lock had four holes. Initially, we thought that only a portion of the water would be diverted into the city via the Tieling Lock, but the actual flow was very large; at the same time, the lakes in the city could no longer accommodate water from outside the city. The stilling basin elevation of this lock was based on the engineering design of the old lock in 1950. Now it seems that the lock bottom can be lowered by one meter. In this way, not only can the river slope be increased and the water flow smoother than before, but also the drop height of the downstream waterfall can be reduced by one meter. This approach could save 50,000 catties of millet.

	(2) We have a rough and careless work style and lack due responsibility. The most typical example is the outlet project of the old sewer in the Beishengou of Damaochang. When surveying this project, we did not investigate, but simply inquired casually, and subjectively believed that the old sewer line must be winding under the houses, so we decided to straighten it and build a new sewer during the design. However, after construction started, it was discovered that the old sewer line was originally straight and did not need to be straightened. As a result, excessive pipes and gravel were transported, wasting more than 1,000 catties of millet. Another example is the reconstruction project of the water-blocking bridges on the Liangshui River, which was designed according to the standard of a load not exceeding three tons, but some bridges had to pass cars and tractors. After construction, it was found that the load-bearing capacity of the bridge near the tractor station was insufficient, so it had to be reinforced. Because we considered that some bridges had to pass floods, we inappropriately raised the bridge surface, failing to recognize that the purpose of building bridges is to facilitate traffic. After discovering these problems, we only passively prevented heavy vehicles from crossing the bridge, instead of actively trying to reinforce the bridge and truly facilitate the masses. When we designed many projects, we did not pay attention to geological drilling, so the design was not practical. For example, the South Moat and Shuiguan project outside You'anmen did not undergo geological drilling. Based solely on subjective understanding, the depth of river bottom excavation was determined. As a result, quicksand was encountered during construction, causing great difficulties. After construction, it was measured and verified that the excavated part had an average backflow of about five decimeters, which was equivalent to excavating more than 1,600 cubic meters in vain, resulting in a loss of 10,000 catties of millet.

	(3) Hoping to "save" but actually wasting. When we carried out the first phase of the Xihai (Shichahai, Jishuitan) sewer project, in order to save money, we did not conduct load-bearing tests, but roughly estimated the load-bearing capacity of the foundation based on the experience of swimming pool construction. We subjectively thinned the foundation and adopted separate foundation construction methods. Cracks were found on the foundation after completion. When constructing the second phase of the project, the lessons of the first phase were not accepted. The design was only changed hastily, and no load-bearing tests were conducted, resulting in the discovery of cracks again. The Shichahai Qianhai and Jishuitan revetment projects were originally allocated to build dry-stone masonry straight wall revetments. However, due to the difficulty in mining and transporting stones, they were changed to cement brick masonry sloping revetments, but the effect of soil water pressure was not adequately studied. As a result, unevenness occurred after one winter, and cracks in severe areas reached one decimeter. Most personnel had not done such revetments, and there was no consensus on whether such revetments should allow water permeability, so the design was decided. This was obviously risky. The original design was to lay a pebble foundation under the cement bricks, requiring each cement brick not to be connected as a whole. This was for easy repair when individual bricks were damaged by subsidence. However, because the design was not practical, it was difficult to construct the pebble foundation, so it was hastily changed to a concrete foundation, forming a monolithic structure, which was also a cause of the cracks. During the construction process, some engineers raised opinions, but they were not taken seriously. Only taking care of the workers not being idle, they rushed to start construction sloppily, resulting in forced rework and repair, wasting more than 70,000 catties of millet.

	(4) Some projects were designed and constructed simultaneously, resulting in losses. For example, when building the People's Swimming Pool, in order to solicit opinions from all parties, the design work was completed relatively late. However, when the design was not completely determined, the leading cadres decided to start construction immediately because the construction unit was idle. By the time the design was determined, a portion of the earthwork had been over-excavated, and 2,275 cubic meters had been transported out. After the swimming pool body project was completed, a portion of the soil still needed to be backfilled, costing a lot of labor. Adding round-trip transportation costs, the loss was more than 20,000 catties of millet.

	II. Construction Aspects

	(1) There was a lack of strict systems, and there have been phenomena of arbitrarily changing designs or not constructing according to the original designs. For example, the width and thickness of the sewer foundation, and the manholes at the intersections and turns of the sewer, were not built according to the design specifications. Some arbitrarily cancelled the low-water troughs in the manholes, which easily accumulated sludge. Some sewer brick walls were not fully laid, and the grouting was insufficient, resulting in serious water leakage after being built. The Sijiakeng to Xuanwumen sewer was designed to have 70 rain inlets, but there was no specific basis. During construction, 40 were omitted. The location of the manholes in the Xihai sewer was arbitrarily constructed, some south of the sewer line, and some north of the sewer line. Making some necessary modifications to the design based on the actual situation during construction is appropriate, but arbitrary changes are extremely likely to cause serious errors.

	(2) Lack of scientific accuracy. For example, the length of the stilling basin of the Nanhan River Yuyuantan control gate on the as-built drawing is 4.48 meters, while the actual length is 4.9 meters, a difference of more than 4 decimeters; the distance between the three sections of manholes in the Fahuasi sewer is erroneous by 0.8 meters to 1.25 meters; among the 41 old sewer sections that were the focus of inspection, there were 23 places where the distance error between manholes was greater than 1 meter, and individual errors reached 7 meters; in the 31 sections of slope inspected, there were 11 sections where the error was greater than 0.5 per thousand; on the as-built drawings of the first phase of the Xihai sewer project, four rain inlets were missing, and one manhole and one section of sewer were missing on the plan. From the as-built drawings, it also reflects a rough and careless work style in construction.

	(3) Lack of thorough planning. Due to the lack of thorough construction planning and the failure to do a good job of preparatory work before construction, a lot of losses were also caused. For example, before the start of the Dongbianmen Inner West Bian Road sewer project, the stones were piled up near the sewer line. When excavating during construction, the stones needed to be transported away, and when using the materials, they needed to be transported back, increasing transportation costs. In the Xihai sewer project, the cofferdam was poorly designed and was washed away by a heavy rain. The trench was soaked, and supports were added; this approach was not calculated in detail, resulting in two collapses, wasting a lot of labor. Another example is the Sijiakeng to Xuanwumen sewer project. Due to the misestimation of the production quantity of cement pipes, the supply was insufficient after construction started, and some sections were temporarily changed to brick-built sewers, resulting in idle labor and increased transportation costs.

	(4) Perfunctory, causing losses. For example, in the bridge projects on the Liangshui River and Nanhan River, stinky oil was applied to the wood, and some only coated the surface as a decoration. No attention was paid to the parts above and below the water surface that are prone to decay, failing to exert the effect of oiling. The more than 6,000 catties of millet spent on oiling was wasted. The Yiheyuan sluice project built in 1950 also had some plastering work done with cement slurry because the concrete was roughly made, but it fell off after a short time, wasting 3,500 catties of millet in vain.

Over the past year, under the correct leadership of higher authorities, our bureau has implemented the policy of "serving the working people" and "doing more with less money," and has achieved great results in the construction of sanitation projects in Beijing, solving the difficulties of many working people and winning the praise of the masses. However, due to the many shortcomings in our work, we have not been able to use every penny of the country economically and rationally, causing significant losses to state property. We believe that the reasons for these shortcomings are not only due to our lack of necessary knowledge and experience, but more importantly and seriously due to the many erroneous thoughts and styles that exist in us.

	First, we seriously have a rough, careless, and subjective style. In design and construction, there is a lack of thorough and systematic investigation and research, so errors are inevitable. The reason why many of the aforementioned projects failed is mostly due to the lack of necessary measurement and geological drilling, disregard for historical materials, and insufficient precise calculation. In the future, we must stipulate investigation and research as a system in engineering. Design and construction cannot be carried out without sufficient investigation and research.

	Second, the one-sidedness of our thinking methods often leads us to consider one aspect and ignore the related other aspect. Considering that bridges need to pass floods, we ignore the convenience of heavy trucks and other traffic; paying attention to "saving" ignores quality, actually forming a great waste.

	Third, in our work, there are still remnants of the corrupt bureaucratic style of the Kuomintang reactionary government and the influence of the old system. After accepting tasks, we sometimes still arrange them layer by layer downwards, and after the project is completed, we report upwards layer by layer. An important project, in the process of surveying, design, and construction, often does not seriously study together with the staff, so the shortcomings and errors in the work process cannot be discovered and corrected in time. After the project is completed, we go to check, sometimes we cannot find the error in time, sometimes we find it and change it, but it is too late.

	In terms of work systems, although we also have survey specifications, design plans, construction instructions, inspection systems, and project acceptance methods, they are neither systematic enough nor clear enough. In the process of implementation, we have not adhered to them well, nor have we carefully revised them in practice, so they have become a formality. In these specifications, instructions, and plans, it is "only the signatory is seen, and no one knows who is responsible." In the future, any work system must implement a responsibility system, otherwise any system is empty and useless.

	Fourth, lack of mass perspective, not good at determining the plan and design of the project according to the needs of the masses. In the process of engineering design and construction, there is a lack of clear understanding of the political purpose of a project, often ignoring the needs of the masses, and starting purely from a technical point of view. Mayor Peng Zhen has repeatedly instructed us to "have a mass perspective," "do more with less money," and "popularize first, then improve," asking us to weigh the priorities and solve the biggest problems for the masses with the least money. However, in our actual work, we have not implemented this instruction well. This year, in order to solve the problem of flooding in the suburbs, more than 2 million catties of rice were allocated for engineering fees, allowing us to renovate the Nanhan River, Lianhua River, and Liangshui River. However, due to the purely technical point of view, we spent five-thirds of the engineering fees on the Nanhan River, which flooded 3,000 acres of land, and only one-eighth of the engineering fees on the Lianhua River, which flooded more than 10,000 acres of land. In the sewer project, there are also many rain inlets built too high, and rainwater cannot flow in. These must be vigorously corrected. This spring, we began to pay attention to these issues, such as contacting the local government and the masses during the project, forming a committee to assist in the construction of ditches, assisting the project, and soliciting opinions from the masses after the completion of various projects, inviting the masses to accept the project together. However, we have not done enough. Some are just formalities.

	Finally, we saw some achievements in our work, so we developed a dangerous sense of complacency and pride. We only like praise and dislike criticism. Sometimes there are even serious phenomena of unwillingness to inspect and unwillingness to accept inspection. We did not promptly launch criticism and self-criticism, timely discover and overcome the shortcomings in our work, and educate and improve all cadres.

In order to make up for these losses, in addition to conducting preliminary engineering inspections and making public self-criticism in the newspapers, we will continue to launch criticism and self-criticism among the staff, educate all personnel, overcome various errors and shortcomings, strengthen the ideological leadership of engineering construction, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and various parts of our country, improve our work, and establish new work systems, so as to better serve the working people.

    北京市人民政府卫生工程局关于基本建设工程的检查报告
    今年六月十六日，人民日报发表了“没有正确的工程设计就不可能施工”的社论，六月十九日，政务院财政经济委员会发布了关于检查基本建设的指示，当时，我们对于这个问题，尚未予以应有的重视。六月十八日，人民日报发表了由我局修建的北京造纸厂下水道失效的消息，我们最初仍把责任推到客观原因上。经过上级指示和我们自己的检讨后，才明确了检查基本建设的精神。我们除对北京造纸厂下水道问题作了检讨外，并自七月中旬开始，对所有的工程进行了全面的检查。在检查中发现了以下问题。
        一、设计方面
    （一）在工程设计前，缺乏调查研究，缺乏全面观点与发展观点，孤立地局部地进行设计，致造成极大损失。例如，我们在设计龙须沟下水道工程以前，对龙须沟附近地形，没有进行足够的调查研究，对流域面积和流量大小，没有进行通盘的周密的研究和计算。当时，我们只考虑了解决龙须沟附近的排水问题。下水道修竣后，部分住户院内，仍然积水，因此不得不添建一道下水道。又如，一九五零年修建永定门内东便道下水道（双孔方沟）时，坡度仅设计为万分之六；修竣后，发现下水道下游出口与南护城河河底距离很大，出口还可降低，坡度亦可加大。如此，则同样断面的下水道，当可容纳更多的流量。当初若将东便道下水道修得大一些，坡度陡一些，把永定门内的旧下水道加以整修利用，把东晓市下水道线管径加大一些，就可更好地解决整个龙须沟一带的排水问题。一九五零年，设计松林闸时，只考虑了向城内引水，未考虑排洪。闸孔设计为三孔，但上游三岔口闸却是四孔，最初，我们认为只把一部分水，经由铁灵闸导入城内，但实际上流量很大；同时城内湖泊，不可能再容纳城外的水。该闸的海漫高程，在一九五零年我们是根据旧闸的工程设计的，现在看来，闸底是可以降低一公尺的。这样，不但河道坡度可以增大，流水较前通畅，而且下游的跌水高度，也可少修一公尺。这种作法，可能节省五万斤小米。
    （二）我们有粗枝大叶的作风，缺乏应有的责任心。最典型的例子，是打磨厂北深沟旧下水道出水口工程。我们在测量这一工程时，没有调查，只是随便打听了一下，就主观地认为旧下水道线，一定是弯弯曲曲地压在房屋底下，所以在设计时，决定裁弯取直，另建一条新下水道。但开工后，发现了旧下水道线原来是直的，无需裁弯。结果白运去了过多的管子和砂石，浪费一千余斤小米。又如凉水河上阻水桥梁的改建工程，是根据载重不超过三吨的标准设计的，但有些桥是要过汽车和拖拉机的。施工以后，才发现拖拉机站附近的桥梁载重量不够，只得重新加强。我们由于考虑到有些桥要通过洪水，于是不适当地提高桥面，没有认识到修桥的目的是便利交通。发现这些毛病后，我们只是消极地阻止重车过桥，而不是积极地设法加固桥梁，真正便利群众。我们设计许多工程时，没有重视地质钻探，因而设计不切合实际。例如，右安门外南护城河与水关工程，未经地质钻探，仅凭主观了解，就决定了河底掏挖的深度。因而在施工中遇到流沙，造成很大困难。施工后经测量查验，发觉挖完部分，又有一段平均回涌五公寸左右，等于白挖了一千六百余公方，损失一万斤小米。
    （三）希图“节省”，实际浪费。我们进行四海
    （什刹海、积水潭）下水道第一期工程时，为了省钱，未进行承载试验，只凭游泳场施工的经验，大致估计地基的承载力，主观地将基础改薄，采用了分离基础施工办法。竣工后，基础上即发现裂纹。第二期工程施工时，没有接受第一期的教训，只草率地把设计改变了一下，仍未进行承载试验，致又发现了裂缝。什刹前海、积水潭护岸工程，原拨修建浆砌块石直墙式护岸，后因采运块石困难，又改为水泥砖砌斜坡式护岸，但对土壤水压力的作用研究不够。以致经过一个冬季，即发生凸凹不平现象，严重部分裂缝达一公寸。大部分人员没有做过这样的护岸，对这种护岸应否允许透水的问题，并未取得一致意见，就决定了设计，这显然是冒险的。原设计是水泥砖下铺垫卵石基础，要求各水泥砖块不要连成一个整体，这是为了个别砖块沉陷破坏时，易于修补。但因设计不切合实际，铺垫卵石基础不易施工，故草率地改变成混凝土基础，形成整体的结构，这也是造成破裂的一个原因。在施工过程中，有的工程师曾提出意见，但未得到重视，只照顾工人不窝工，就马马虎虎赶着动工，结果被迫返工补修，浪费七万余斤小米。
    （四）有些工程，一面设计，一面施工，造成损失。例如，修建人民游泳场时，为征求各方面意见，完成设计工作较迟。但在设计尚未完全确定时，因施工单位窝着工力，领导干部即决定马上开工。至设计确定时，土方已多挖了一部分，并运出了二、二七五公方。游泳场池身工程修竣后，仍需回填一部分土，多费了很多工力。加上往返运费，损失两万余斤小米。
        二、施工方面
    （一）缺乏严格的制度，曾经发生随便变更设计，或不按原设计施工的现象。例如，下水道基础的宽窄厚薄，下水道交叉和转弯处的检查井，均未按设计规定修筑，有的随意取消检查井内的低水流槽，致易淤积污泥，有的砌下水道砖墙不满铺满砌，灌浆不充足，致砌好后发生严重漏水现象。司家坑至宣武门下水道，设计规定修七十个雨水口，但无具体根据，施工时，竟少修了四十个。四海下水道检查井的位置是随意修建的，有的在下水道线南，有的在下水道线北。施工中根据实际情况，对设计进行某些必要的修改，这是应该的，但随意变动是极易造成严重错误的。
    （二）缺乏科学的准确性。例如，南旱河玉渊潭节制闸海漫的长度，竣工图上是四点四八公尺，而实际是四点九公尺，相差四公寸之多；法华寺下水道，有三段检查井间的距离差误到○点八公尺至一点二五公尺；重点检查的四十一段旧下水道中，检查井间距离误差大于一公尺的有二十三处，个别差错到七公尺；在检查的三十一段坡度中，差误大于千分之○点五的有十一段；四海下水道第一期工程竣工图上，丢掉雨水口四座，平面图上少绘了检查井一座和一段下水道。从竣工图来看，也表现出施工上粗枝大叶的工作作风。
    （三）缺乏周密的计划。由于施工计划不周密，开工前的准备工作未作好，也造成了不少损失。例如，永定门内西便道下水道工程开工前，把石子堆放在靠近下水道线的地方，开工时挖土，需要把石子运走，用料时又需要运回，增加了搬运费。四海下水道工程中，挡水坝设计不好，一场大雨就被冲毁，雨水泡了槽，又加支撑；这种作法也没有经过详细计算，造成两处坍塌，浪费了很多工力。又如，司家坑至宣武门下水道工程，由于错估了水泥管子的生产数量，致开工后供应不及，部分工段临时改修砖砌下水道，造成了窝工现象，并增加了搬运费。
    （四）敷衍塞责，造成损失。例如，凉水河、南旱河的桥梁工程中，在木料上涂抹臭油，有的只涂了外表，作为粉饰，对容易腐朽的水面以上及以下部分，却没有注意，不能发挥涂油的作用。所用六千余斤小米的涂油费，形成浪费。一九五零年修建的颐和园水闸工程，因混凝土打得粗糙，也曾做了些洋灰浆抹面的粉饰工作，但时间不长，即行脱落，白白浪费了三千五百斤小米。
    一年以来，我局在上级的正确领导下，执行了“为劳动人民服务”和“少花钱，多做事”的方针，在北京市的卫生工程建设上，得到很大的成绩，解决了不少劳动人民的困难，得到了群众的赞扬。但是，由于我们的工作中存在着许多缺点，所以没有能把国家的每一分钱，都经济、合理地加以使用，给国家财产造成重大的损失。我们认为产生这些缺点的原因，不仅是由于我们缺乏应有的知识和经验，更主要更严重的是由于我们存在着许多错误的思想和作风。
    第一，我们严重地存在着粗枝大叶、主观主义的作风。在设计、施工中，都缺乏周密的有系统的调查研究，因而不可避免地要发生错误。前述很多工程所以失败的原因，多数是缺乏必要的测量与地质钻探，不重视历史材料，计算不够精确造成的。今后，我们要把调查研究工作，规定成为工程上的一种制度，调查研究如不充分，便不能设计和施工。
    第二，思想方法上的片面性，使我们常常考虑了这一面，就忽略了有联系的另一面。考虑到修桥要通过洪水，就忽略了载重汽车等的交通方便；注意了“节约”，就忽略了质量，实际上形成很大的浪费。
    第三，我们的工作中，还残存着国民党反动政府腐朽的官僚主义作风和旧制度的影响。我们接受任务后，有时仍然是一层一层地向下布置，工程完了，就一层一层向上报告。一个重要的工程，在测量、设计、施工过程中，多未认真和工作人员共同研究，因而工作过程中的缺点、错误，不能及时发现与纠正，待工程完了，再去检查，有时不能及时发现错误，有时发现再改，已经迟了。
    在工作制度方面，我们虽然也有勘测规范，设计方案、施工说明、检查制度和工程验收办法等，但既不够系统，也不够明确。在执行当中，并未很好坚持，更未在实践中认真修正，因之流于形式。在这些规范、说明与方案上，是“只见签字人，不知谁负责”。任何工作制度，今后必须贯彻责任制，否则任何制度，都是空洞无用的。
    第四，缺乏群众观点，不善于根据群众的需要，决定工程的计划与设计。在工程设计和施工过程中，对一个工程的政治目的缺乏明确认识，往往忽略群众需要，单纯从技术观点出发。彭真市长屡屡指示我们，“要有群众观点”、“少花钱，多做事”、“先普及、后提高”，要我们斟酌轻重缓急，以最少的钱，给群众解决最大的问题。但是，我们在实际工作中，对这个指示未能很好贯彻。今年为解决郊区水淹问题，抽拨了二百余万斤米的工程费，让我们整修南旱河、莲花河和凉水河。但由于纯技术观点作祟，我们在淹地三千亩的南旱河，用去了五分之三的工程费，在淹地一万余亩的莲花河，却只用了工程费的八分之一。在下水道工程中，也有很多雨水口修得过高，雨水流不进去。这些都是必须大力改正的。今年春天，我们开始注意了这些问题，如在工程进行时，和当地区政府及群众取得联系，组成协助修沟委员会，协助工程进行；各项工程竣工后，征求群众意见，邀请群众一道验收等。但是，我们作得还很不够。有些流于形式。
    最后，我们看到工作有了些成绩，因此产生了危险的自满骄傲情绪。只喜欢表扬，不喜欢批评。有时甚至发生不愿检查和不愿接受检查的严重现象。我们没有及时的展开批评与自我批评，及时发现并克服工作中的缺点，教育和提高全体干部。
    为了弥补这些损失，我们除已进行了初步的工程检查，在报纸上公开检讨外，并将继续在工作人员中，展开批评与自我批评，教育全体人员，克服各种错误和缺点，加强工程建设的思想领导，学习苏联与我国各地的先进经验，改进我们的工作，建立新的工作制度，以便更好地为劳动人民服务。
