    Volunteer Army Technician Zhang Tianzuo
    Reports on Growing Strength of Our Forces on Korean Front
    Editor's Note: Zhang Benxin, the director of the Beijing Nursing Home, personally brought a letter to this newspaper. She said: "I am a 62-year-old woman. On March 1st, I was sent by the Beijing Relief Association to Ganyu Hutong to take over the nursing home funded by the United States. I am now the director of the hospital. My nephew, Zhang Tianzuo, is a technician. He joined the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and is now working on bridge engineering on the Korean front. I recently received a letter from him, talking about the growing strength of our volunteer army. I was very moved after reading it. I am determined to strive to be a model in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. Now I give you this letter, hoping that you will publish it in the newspaper to encourage everyone." The following is an abstract of Zhang Tianzuo's letter.
    Dear Second Aunt: Our strength on the Korean front is growing stronger day by day. Second Aunt, we are no longer afraid of American aerial bandits sneaking attacks. The enemy planes have not dared to bomb the bridges we are responsible for building and other bridges for a long time. We feel very proud when we see the bridges that we have surveyed, designed, and built ourselves. These bridges are demonstrating to the enemy planes, making the American devils panic and wonder, and the bridges in Korea are being bombed more and more. The so-called "air superiority" boasted by the United States has long been bankrupt. Now, many vehicles carrying guns, ammunition, and supplies are transported from our bridges to the front line every day, and this is just the beginning!
    Our brother units have also widened the roads and compacted the road surface like asphalt roads. Transportation has been greatly facilitated. These situations fill us with confidence in the victory that is sure to come.
                                Nephew Zhang Tianzuo

    志愿军技术人员张天佐
    报告朝鲜前线我力量日益壮大
    编者按：北京养老院院长张本馨亲至本报送来一信，她说：“我是一个六十二岁的老人，我在三月一日被北京救济分会派来甘雨胡同接收受美国津贴的养老院，我现在是该院的院长。我侄儿张天佐是个技术人员，他参加了中国人民志愿军，现在朝鲜前线做桥梁工程工作。最近我接到他的来信，谈到我们志愿军力量壮大的一些情形，我看了以后受了很大的感动。我下定决心，要努力在抗美援朝运动中争取作模范。现在我把这封信给你们，希望你们登在报上，以鼓舞大家。”以下是张天佐来信的摘要。
    亲爱的二姑：朝鲜前线我们的力量已一天比一天壮大起来。二姑，我们再也不怕美国空中强盗来偷袭了。我们负责修建的桥梁和其他桥梁，敌机已经有很长时间没有敢来炸了。我们看到我们自己测量、设计与建造起来的桥梁，感到很骄傲。这些桥梁在向敌机示威，让美国鬼子们惊慌奇怪，朝鲜的桥梁是愈炸愈多了。美国吹嘘的所谓“空中优势”，是早已破产了。现在每天有许多车辆载着枪炮、弹药与给养从我们的桥上运往前线，而这还仅仅是开始呢！
    我们的兄弟部队也把公路加宽了，把路面压得跟柏油路一样。运输交通已经大大方便。这些情形都使我们对于必定要来到的胜利充满着信心。
                                侄　张天佐
