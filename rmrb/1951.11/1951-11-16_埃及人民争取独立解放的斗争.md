　　The Egyptian People's Struggle for Independence and Liberation
    Shao Yamin
    On October 8th, Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas submitted to the Egyptian Parliament a bill to abolish the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and the 1899 Anglo-Egyptian Condominium Agreement on Sudan. This bill was passed by the Egyptian Parliament on October 15th and formally promulgated by the Egyptian King on the 16th. This event is a result of the unprecedented growth of the world's peace and democracy camp and the rising anti-imperialist movement of the Egyptian people. This event shows the growing strength of the Egyptian people, forcing the Egyptian government to comply with the will of the people and declare the abolition of these two indentures that enslave the Egyptian people. The new surge of the Egyptian people's anti-imperialist struggle is taking place at a time when the US-British imperialist war bloc is stepping up war preparations in the East and West, especially in the Mediterranean and the Middle East, organizing the so-called "Middle East Joint Command," attempting to turn the Middle East countries into bases of aggression and drive the Middle East people to act as cannon fodder for aggression. Its significance is very great. First, the struggle of the Egyptian people has shaken the foundation of the US-British imperialism's rule in the Middle East, directly striking the US-British imperialism's war preparations in the Middle East; secondly, the struggle of the Egyptian people will inevitably relatively weaken the strength of the imperialist camp and enhance the strength of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union; finally, the Egyptian people's struggle for the abolition of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and for national independence, like the Iranian people's struggle for oil nationalization, will inevitably further promote the struggle of the entire West Asia and Africa, especially the Arab countries, to further unite and fight together to break the shackles of imperialism and realize national independence and freedom.

    (I)
    The ancient Egyptian people are one of the earliest nations in the world to develop culture, industrious, brave and creative. As early as more than 3,000 years before the Christian era, the ancient Egyptian people had built the world-famous giant pyramids; in the 16th century BC, they had a more perfect writing system and a more complete political and social system. In the 16th and 17th centuries BC, the ancient Egyptian people united as one and drove out a foreign invader - the "Hyksos Dynasty." However, in the following thousands of years, the Egyptian people suffered cruel exploitation and oppression by internal slave owners, feudal landlords, and foreign invaders, namely the feudal rulers of Greece, Rome, Arabia, and Turkey, which led to poverty and weakness, the stagnation of social productive forces, and the great weakening of national resistance. As a result, Britain was able to invade Egypt in 1882 after the Turks and occupy Cairo.

    Since invading Egypt, Britain has implemented bloody violent repression and cruel economic plunder against the Egyptian people. Egyptian cotton, oil, phosphorus, manganese and other minerals were transported to Britain in large quantities; British capitalists opened factories and mines in Egypt, brutally exploiting Egyptian workers; British goods poured into Egyptian rural areas in large quantities; British capitalists, like vampires, sucked the blood of the Egyptian working people, making the Egyptian working people live a life worse than that of cattle and horses. In 1914, when the First World War began, British imperialism took the opportunity of the war to declare Egypt a protectorate. In 1922, due to the struggle of the Egyptian people, British imperialism, fearing the strength of the Egyptian people, was forced to recognize Egypt's independence, but continued to occupy Egypt and implemented despicable and dirty divisive measures, inducing the Egyptian landlord class and big bourgeoisie to submit to it. In 1936, British imperialism, through threats and inducements, forced the government of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie headed by the Wafd Party to sign the Anglo-Egyptian Twenty-Year Alliance Treaty, which continued to enslave the Egyptian people. After the Second World War, due to the rising anti-imperialist wave of the Egyptian people, the Wafd Party was forced to put forward the anti-British nationalist slogan and demand the revision of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt; however, British imperialism repeatedly played tricks of deception and delay, refusing to withdraw its troops. According to statistics, Britain has announced the withdrawal of troops from Egypt to the world as many as sixty times, but until today, British imperialism has not only not fulfilled its promise to withdraw troops, but has increased the British troops stationed in Egypt to more than 10,000 above the number stipulated in the treaty.

    After the Second World War, US imperialism began to intervene in Egypt. US imperialism has continued to induce the Egyptian government to rely on it through loans, "aid," and other means to exclude British influence, and attempted to turn the entire Middle East, including Egypt, into a base for its war of aggression. According to the "New Times" magazine, US imperialism has built many strategic highways, new ports and airports in Egypt and other regions of the Middle East, and expanded the original ports and airports, turning them into new-style naval and air bases. Secret and overt American agents are everywhere in Egypt and other Middle Eastern countries taking and drawing strategic maps, studying strategic terrain, and looking for new military bases; American engineers and technicians are being sent to these places one after another. In 1950, US imperialism transferred troops from West Germany, about 6,000 people, to Egypt to assist the British army in suppressing the Egyptian people; on the one hand, it drafted the so-called "Three-Power Declaration" with Britain and France at the London Conference, and announced this declaration on May 25 of the same year. This declaration said: "The three countries are willing to 'guarantee' the existing borders of the Middle East countries and are prepared to supply the Arab bloc countries and Israel with weapons and other military materials." The purpose of the Three-Power Declaration is to drive the Middle East countries into the arms race movement and pave the way for the organization of the Mediterranean Group. The suggestion to the Egyptian government jointly put forward by the United States, Britain, France, and Turkey on October 13 to "establish a Middle East Joint Command" is a further development of this Three-Power Declaration conspiracy. At the same time, the British government, under the direction of the United States, suggested to the Egyptian government to establish an "International Committee" jointly participated in by the United States, Britain, and Egypt to "monitor the constitutional development of Sudan." The above-mentioned four-nation proposal was formally rejected by the Egyptian government on October 15. Subsequently, the diplomatic departments of Britain and the United States respectively issued statements in London and Washington, threatening the Egyptian government and people. US imperialism also attempted to force the Egyptian government to submit through "mediation." The past and recent facts fully show that US and British imperialism are the mortal enemies of the Egyptian people. They are deliberately planning to suppress the struggle of the Egyptian people, attempting to realize their conspiracy to turn Egypt into a war base and drive the Egyptian people to act as cannon fodder for aggression.

    (II)
    The seventy years of Egyptian history under imperialist rule is also a history of struggle written by the Egyptian people with their blood and tears. Since Britain invaded Egypt in 1882, the Egyptian people have never stopped their struggle against the invaders. From 1882 to the First World War, the Egyptian people held many anti-imperialist struggles; in 1906, the Egyptian people held a large-scale strike to protest the oppression of British imperialism. The success of the Russian October Revolution in 1917 brought the Egyptian people's struggle into a new stage. In 1919, Egyptian workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, and the emerging bourgeoisie united to fight a large-scale struggle against imperialism, forcing British imperialism to make concessions to the Egyptian people and recognize Egypt's independence. However, due to British imperialism's divisive tricks and the betrayal and surrender of the comprador bourgeoisie and the landlord class, the Egyptian people's revolution soon suffered setbacks. In 1936, the government headed by the Wafd Party openly surrendered to British imperialism and signed the Anglo-Egyptian Twenty-Year Alliance Treaty, which continued to enslave the Egyptian people. The union of people of all strata in Egypt was also split. Part of the national bourgeoisie split off and organized the Sa'dist Party in 1937. After the Second World War, due to the defeat of the German, Japanese, and Italian fascists, Britain and France were weakened; and the world people's fortress of peace - the Soviet Union - was unprecedentedly powerful, and many people's democratic countries appeared in Eastern Europe, and the world situation underwent tremendous changes. Under this new situation, the struggle of the Egyptian people also developed forward. Egyptian workers, peasants, intellectuals, petty bourgeoisie and national bourgeoisie, etc., began to form a united front, and put forward new struggle policies for striving for national independence, protecting peace and democracy, and opposing imperialist war, and the struggle wave began to expand to the countryside. In 1949, the struggle of peasants against landlords was widely found in rural Egypt. At the same time, the Egyptian working class also began to lead the struggle of the Egyptian people. The victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China brought about another decisive change in the world situation since the October Revolution, making the strength of the world's peace and democracy camp obviously surpass the strength of the imperialist aggression camp; especially importantly, the victory of the Chinese people's revolution pointed out a new road for the revolution of the people in colonial and semi-colonial countries all over the world, and made the victory of the revolution of the people in colonial and semi-colonial countries more concrete guarantee. Under the inspiration of the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, the tide of struggle of the Egyptian people is rising day by day. In 1950 alone, Egyptian workers, peasants, and petty bourgeoisie organized 29 large-scale strikes and demonstrations. With the rising tide of the Iranian people's anti-imperialist struggle, the Egyptian people's movement to demand the abolition of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and national independence has been launched on a new scale throughout the country. On August 26 this year, thousands of workers, students and citizens in Cairo, regardless of the suppression of the Egyptian authorities, held high banners and demonstrated, demanding the abolition of the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty; since then, people in other cities in Egypt have also held large-scale demonstrations. The Egyptian government, under the situation of the rising anti-imperialist movement of the people throughout the country, announced the abolition of the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and the 1899 Anglo-Egyptian agreement on the co-management of Sudan. This decision of the Egyptian government has won the widespread support of the people throughout Egypt. People in major cities in Egypt are holding large-scale demonstrations almost every day; railway workers, car drivers, customs staff, and telephone and telegraph staff in the Suez Canal area are refusing to work for the British army in practical actions, enthusiastically participating in this struggle. The just struggle of the Egyptian people against imperialism has been rapidly unfolding like a raging fire throughout the country.

    (III)
    Today, the Egyptian people's struggle is unfolding in a brand new era. This era is the era when "the era of imperialism dominating the world" has "forever come to an end." This era has opened up an extremely favorable new situation for the Egyptian people's struggle. The characteristic of this new situation is that the strength of the world's peace camp has greatly surpassed the strength of the imperialist aggression camp; the strength of the peace camp is rapidly rising, while the strength of the imperialist aggression camp is constantly weakening. On the side of the peace and democracy camp: the strength of the Soviet Union is unprecedentedly strong, the great People's Republic of China has been founded, many people's democratic countries have been founded, the awareness of the people all over the world has been raised, and the national liberation movements throughout Asia and North Africa have sprung up vigorously. However, imperialist countries are increasingly falling into a serious general economic crisis, the strength of the entire imperialist system has been greatly weakened, the entire foundation of imperialism in Asia has begun to shake, and US imperialism's aggression in Korea has been severely hit by the Chinese and Korean people; imperialism's aggression in other regions of the world is also encountering strong resistance from the people.

    This very favorable objective situation, coupled with the increased awareness of the Egyptian people, guarantees that the Egyptian people will inevitably defeat the aggressive forces of imperialism and achieve final victory. However, the Egyptian people's struggle today is only the beginning of a new development. Serious struggle tasks are being placed before the Egyptian people. In the future, the Egyptian people should prepare to overcome a series of difficulties and persist in the struggle for a long time. In the future, British imperialism will certainly continue to carry out violent offensives and use despicable means such as diplomatic threats and inducements in an attempt to continue to enslave the Egyptian people; in the future, US imperialism will certainly play tricks such as "mediation" and "suggestions" to directly or indirectly interfere in the Egyptian people's struggle, in an attempt to take the opportunity to invade Egypt. Therefore, the Egyptian people must be particularly vigilant against all conspiracies of British and American imperialism and prepare to wage a resolute struggle to smash the imperialist military offensive and interference.

    The Egyptian people's struggle today is not isolated. The people of all Arab countries, the people of all Asia, and the people of the world are all warmly supporting the Egyptian people's just struggle. We, the 475 million people of the new China under the leadership of Mao Zedong, express deep concern and infinite sympathy for the struggle of our Egyptian brothers.

　　埃及人民争取独立解放的斗争
    邵亚民
    埃及首相纳哈斯于十月八日向埃及议会提出了关于废除一九三六年英埃条约和一八九九年英埃共管苏丹协定的法案，这一法案已于十月十五日由埃及议会通过，十六日由埃及国王批准正式公布。这一事件是世界和平民主阵营力量空前壮大与埃及人民反帝运动高涨的结果。这一事件表示了埃及人民力量的日益增长，使埃及政府不得不顺从人民的意志，宣布废止这两个奴役埃及人民的卖身契。埃及人民反帝斗争浪潮的新的高涨，是发生在美英帝国主义战争集团正在东西两方加紧准备战争，特别是在地中海和中东方面组织所谓“中东联合司令部”，企图变中东各国为侵略基地，并驱使中东人民充当侵略炮灰的时候，其意义是非常巨大的。首先，埃及人民的斗争动摇了美英帝国主义在中东方面的统治基础，直接地打击了美英帝国主义在中东方面的备战计划；其次，埃及人民的斗争必然相对地削弱了帝国主义阵营的力量，而增强了以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量；最后，埃及人民要求废除英埃条约，要求民族独立的斗争，与伊朗人民要求石油国有化的斗争一样，必然地要更进一步地推动整个西部亚洲和非洲人民，特别是阿拉伯国家人民的斗争，使他们更进一步地团结起来，共同为打破帝国主义的枷锁，实现民族的独立与自由而斗争。
    （一）
    古埃及人民是世界上文化发展最早的民族之一，勤劳勇敢而富有创造性。早在纪元前三千多年，古埃及人民即已建筑了世界闻名的巨大的金字塔；在纪元前十六世纪时即有较完善的文字与较完备的政治与社会制度。古埃及人民在纪元前一千六、七百年的时候，曾一致团结起来，驱逐了一个外来侵略者——“牧人王朝”。但是，以后的几千年来由于埃及人民遭受内部奴隶主、封建地主与外来侵略者即希腊、罗马、阿拉伯与土耳其等民族的封建统治者的残酷剥削与压迫，以致陷于贫困衰弱的境地，社会的生产力停滞不进，民族的抵抗力大大地削弱，结果，英国乃得于一八八二年继土耳其人之后侵入埃及，占领开罗。
    英国自侵入埃及以后，即对埃及人民施行了血腥的暴力镇压与经济上的残酷掠夺。埃及的棉花、石油、磷、锰以及其他矿产，大量地被运送到英国去；英国的资本家在埃及开设了工厂、矿山，凶残地剥削埃及的工人；英国的商品，大批地涌进埃及的农村；英国的资本家像吸血鬼一样，吸干了埃及劳动人民的血液，使得埃及的劳动人民过着一种牛马不如的生活。一九一四年第一次世界大战开始，英帝国主义更以战争为藉口，乘机宣布埃及为保护国。一九二二年，由于埃及人民的斗争，英帝国主义摄于埃及人民的力量，被迫承认埃及独立，但却继续占领着埃及，并施行了卑鄙龌龊的分裂手段，诱使埃及的地主阶级和大资产阶级向它屈服。一九三六年，英帝国主义更威胁利诱，迫使以华夫脱党为首的大地主、大资产阶级的政府签订了继续奴役埃及人民的英埃二十年同盟条约。第二次世界大战后，由于埃及人民反帝浪潮的高涨，华夫脱党被迫提出反英的民族主义的口号，并要求修改英埃条约，要求英军撤出埃及；但是英帝国主义一次又一次地玩弄欺骗与拖延手段，不肯撤兵。据统计，英国曾向世界宣布从埃及撤兵达六十次之多，但是直到今天，英帝国主义不但没有履行过撤兵的诺言，反将驻埃及的英军增加到超过条约规定数量一万人以上。
    在第二次世界大战以后，美帝国主义就开始插足到埃及来了。美帝国主义曾继续以贷款“援助”等方式，诱使埃及政府投靠于它，以排斥英国的势力；并企图把包括埃及在内的整个中东变为它侵略战争的基地。据“新时代”杂志报道，美帝国主义在埃及与中东其他地区已建筑了很多的战略公路、新的港口和飞机场，并扩充了原有的港口与飞机场，使其变为新式的海空基地。秘密的与公开的美国特务，在埃及与其他中东国家内，到处在拍摄与绘制战略地图，研究战略地形，并寻找新的军事基地；美国的工程与技术人员，陆续地被派遣到这些地方来。一九五○年美帝国主义一面从西德抽调了军队约六千人左右到埃及，协助英军共同镇压埃及人民；一面与英、法二国在伦敦会议上起草了所谓
    “三国宣言”，并于同年五月二十五日公布了这个宣言。这个宣言说：“三国愿意‘保证’中东各国现有国境，并准备供给阿拉伯集团国家与以色列以武器与其他军事物资”。三国宣言的目的，就是要驱使中东诸国卷入军备竞赛运动，并为组织地中海集团铺平道路。十月十三日由美、英、法、土四国联合向埃及政府提出的“设立中东联合司令部”的建议，也就是这个三国宣言阴谋的进一步发展。同时，英国政府并在美国指示下，向埃及政府建议设立一个由美、英、埃共同参加的“国际委员会”，以“监视苏丹的立宪发展”。上述四国建议已于十月十五日为埃及政府正式拒绝。接着英、美二国的外交部门即分别在伦敦和华盛顿发表声明，恫吓埃及政府与人民。美帝国主义并企图通过“调停”方式，迫使埃及政府屈服。过去以及最近的许多事实，充分表明了美英帝国主义是埃及人民的死敌，他们正在处心积虑地计划镇压埃及人民的斗争，企图实现其变埃及为战争基地并驱使埃及人民充当侵略炮灰的阴谋。
    （二）
    七十年来埃及在帝国主义统治下的历史，同时也就是埃及人民用自己的血泪写成的一部斗争的历史。自一八八二年英国侵入埃及时起，埃及人民从来未停止过反对侵略者的斗争。自一八八二年至第一次世界大战这一阶段内，埃及人民曾举行过多次的反帝的斗争；一九○六年埃及人民曾举行了一次大罢工，抗议英帝国主义的压迫。一九一七年俄国十月革命的成功，使埃及人民的斗争进入了一个新的阶段。一九一九年埃及的工人、农民、小资产阶级和新兴的资产阶级联合起来，向帝国主义作了规模广大的斗争，逼使英帝国主义不得不向埃及人民让步，承认埃及独立。但是由于英帝国主义的分裂诡计与买办资产阶级和地主阶级的叛卖与投降，埃及人民的革命不久就受到了挫折。一九三六年以华夫脱党为首的政府公开投降了英帝国主义，与英帝国主义签订了继续奴役埃及人民的英埃二十年同盟条约。埃及各阶层人民的联合亦告分裂，一部分民族资产阶级分裂出来，在一九三七年另外组织了萨第党。第二次世界大战以后，由于德、日、意法西斯被击溃，英、法被削弱；而世界人民的和平堡垒——苏联却空前地强大，并且在东欧出现许多人民民主国家，世界形势起了巨大的变化。在这个新形势之下，埃及人民的斗争也向前发展。埃及的工人、农民、知识分子、小资产阶级与民族资产阶级等又开始结成了统一阵线，并提出了争取民族独立、保护和平民主、反对帝国主义战争的新的斗争方针，斗争浪潮并开始扩展到农村中去。一九四九年在埃及农村中曾普遍地发现农民反抗地主的斗争。同时，埃及的工人阶级也开始领导了埃及人民的斗争。中国人民革命的胜利与中华人民共和国的成立，使世界形势起了自十月革命以后的再一次决定性的变化，使世界和平民主阵营的力量显然地超过了帝国主义侵略阵营的力量；尤其重要的，是中国人民革命的胜利给全世界殖民地半殖民地人民的革命指出了一条新的道路，并使殖民地半殖民地人民革命的胜利有了更具体的保证。埃及人民在中国人民革命胜利的鼓舞下，斗争的浪潮一天天地高涨起来了。单在一九五○年，埃及的工人、农民和小资产阶级，就组织了二十九次大规模的罢工与示威。随着伊朗人民反帝斗争的高涨，埃及人民要求废除英埃条约、要求民族独立的运动更以新的规模在全国开展起来。今年八月二十六日开罗的工人、学生和市民数千人，不顾埃及当局的镇压，高举旗帜，游行示威，要求废除一九三六年的英埃条约；此后埃及其他城市人民也都相继举行了大规模的游行示威。埃及政府在全国人民反帝运动高涨的情势下，乃宣布废除一九三六年的英埃条约和一八九九年的英埃关于共管苏丹的协定。埃及政府的这一决定，获得埃及全国人民的广泛支持。埃及各大都市的人民，几乎每天都在举行大规模的示威游行；苏彝士运河区的铁路工人、汽车司机、海关职员、电话电报工作人员，更以实际行动拒绝为英军工作，热烈地参加了这一斗争。埃及人民反帝的正义斗争，已在全国各地如火如荼地迅速展开了。
    （三）
    今天埃及人民的斗争，是在一个崭新的时代里展开的。这个时代就是“帝国主义称霸世界的时代”“永远宣告结束了”的时代，这个时代给埃及人民的斗争展开了一个极其有利的新的局面。这个新局面的特征，就是全世界和平阵营的力量已大大地超过了帝国主义侵略阵营的力量；和平阵营的力量正在迅速地上升，而帝国主义侵略阵营的力量却在不断地削弱。在和平民主阵营方面：苏联的力量是空前地强大了，伟大的中华人民共和国成立了，许多人民民主国家成立了，全世界人民的觉悟提高了，整个亚洲和北部非洲的民族解放运动蓬蓬勃勃地起来了。但是，帝国主义国家却正在日甚一日地陷入了严重的经济总危机之中，整个帝国主义体系的力量已经大大削弱了，帝国主义在亚洲的整个根基已开始动摇，美帝国主义在朝鲜的侵略已经遭受了中朝人民的沉重打击；帝国主义在世界其他地区的侵略，也正遭遇到人民的坚强反击。
    这个十分有利的客观情势，再加上埃及人民觉悟程度的提高，就保证了埃及人民必然地可以击败帝国主义的侵略势力并取得最后的胜利。然而，今天埃及人民的斗争还只是新发展的一个开端，严重的斗争任务，正摆在埃及人民的面前。今后埃及人民应该准备克服一系列的困难，长期地坚持斗争下去。英帝国主义今后必定还要继续地进行暴力的进攻与运用外交上的恫吓与利诱等卑鄙手段以图达到继续奴役埃及人民的目的；美帝国主义今后也必定要玩弄“调停”、“建议”等诡计来直接或间接地干涉埃及人民的斗争，以图乘机侵入埃及。因此，埃及人民必须要特别警惕英美帝国主义的一切阴谋，并准备为粉碎帝国主义的武力进攻与干涉而进行坚决的斗争。
    埃及人民今天的斗争并不是孤立的，全体阿拉伯国家的人民，全亚洲人民，全世界人民都是在热烈地支持着埃及人民的正义斗争。我们在毛泽东领导下的新中国四亿七千五百万的人民，更对埃及兄弟的斗争表示深切的关怀与无限的同情。
