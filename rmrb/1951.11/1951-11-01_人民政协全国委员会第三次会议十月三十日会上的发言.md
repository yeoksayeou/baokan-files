**Speech by Li Siguang, Member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference**

**Learning Mao Zedong Thought to Develop Natural Sciences and Build the Country**

Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, Members, and Comrades:

Please allow me, as a scientist, to offer some opinions on a fundamental issue related to the implementation of the Common Program's Article 43: "Efforts will be made to develop natural sciences to serve the construction of industry, agriculture, and national defense." Who will develop natural sciences? This task naturally falls on the shoulders of natural scientists. We scientists all feel a sense of responsibility and determination to accept this glorious task. However, we must consider how we can be qualified to accept this glorious task. The first and most basic condition for determining this qualification is that each of us must have a resolute will to truly serve the people—serving the people's urgent needs must be given top priority; even if we guess that certain work, for the long-term benefit of the people, should be done, it should only be considered secondary. This condition becomes clearer when explained from the opposite perspective: we must oppose serving individuals and serving personal interests or hobbies.

The second condition is that all of us scientists must have the confidence to serve the people. However, I dare not say that every scientist has the confidence to complete the tasks they undertake. Why can I say this? Because there are two ambiguous factors involved: the first factor is whether each scientist believes they have sufficient technical ability to complete the tasks they undertake; the second factor is whether each scientist can say that they have clearly, thoroughly, and happily recognized the need to strive to join the ranks of the people's revolution, contributing all their strength to build the country, making their work meaningful. This connects to the issue of the scientists' own thoughts.

For this major reason, all educational and scientific workers across the country must now understand why Chairman Mao, in his solemn opening speech at this third session of the National Committee, specially pointed out: "Thought reform, especially the thought reform of various intellectuals, is an important condition for thoroughly implementing democratic reforms in all aspects and gradually carrying out industrialization in our country"; why Premier Zhou, despite his busy schedule, spent five hours sincerely explaining to us in Beijing and Tianjin's higher education institutions: the importance of thought reform for intellectuals; why Comrades Guo Moruo, Hu Qiaomu, Li Fuchun, and Song Ruowen, in recent meetings of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, made very important reports. In these reports, some clearly addressed thought issues, while others, although seemingly focused on technical issues, still involved thought issues.

Chairman Mao's instructions and the calls from Premier Zhou and other comrades have widely awakened the awareness of thought reform in the eager-to-progress scientific and educational communities; they have promoted the current heated criticism and self-criticism movement in the scientific and educational communities.

Thus, it is clear that the current issue is not whether the thoughts of scientists who came from the old society—including myself—need to be reformed, but how to reform them. This raises a host of complex issues. Until each issue is thoroughly addressed and resolved, no one can guarantee that there are no big or small issues in their thoughts. Thought reform is a painstaking, meticulous, and urgent task. When a patient's blood contains pathogens, to cure the disease, it is not enough to take a bath; one must use all possible methods, sometimes not painless methods, to strengthen the blood and cells, eliminate pathogens, and restore health.

In this short time, based on my limited understanding, I cannot and dare not propose all the numerous thought issues. However, from my personal experience, it seems that there are a few concise issues worth mentioning:

Most of our Chinese scientists, up to now, have directly or indirectly come out of the scientific communities of various capitalist countries in Western Europe, America, and Japan. Therefore, in their thoughts, they inevitably bear two layers of imprints: one is the imprint of anti-scientific thoughts in capitalist societies; the other is the imprint of semi-feudal, semi-colonial thoughts in old Chinese society.

The first layer of thought imprints mainly includes the characteristics of scientific thought in contemporary capitalist societies. These characteristics include the following points:

1. The erroneous notion that science is above politics. From this erroneous notion, it is easy for scientists to detach from reality, emphasize academic research, or stress purely technical views, thus misleading the general public, including scientists themselves, into thinking that scientific research is merely about solving certain technical problems; scientists do not need to ask why these problems need to be solved, nor do they need to ask how their research results are applied. Thus, some scientific research results are conveniently used by reactionary ruling cliques.

2. From the aforementioned erroneous views, reactionary rulers and capitalists conveniently use the slogan of academic freedom to win over scientists to serve their interests. Scientists themselves also conveniently use this self-deceptive slogan to elevate their status in capitalist societies, sometimes even to reduce guilt.

3. Due to the chaos within capitalism itself, scientific research lacks planning, leading to chaotic phenomena. Capitalist scientists often propose a seemingly self-explanatory explanation for this lack of planning: they say that scientific research is like searching for something in the dark because, not knowing what to search for, one must adapt to the situation and try various methods to find things that are still unknown; if one already knows what is where, then there is no need to search, that is, no need to research, meaning scientific research cannot be restricted by predetermined plans. This seemingly plausible but actually fallacious argument is an excuse and impractical. In reality, the hypotheses or theories of science represent the planned nature of science itself.

There is a situation worth noting: the more precise and strict the plan, the greater the effectiveness of its implementation. However, in fact, based on past data, when making research plans for targets that are difficult to predict in advance, one must give it some flexibility to a certain extent. However, flexibility and strictness are obviously contradictory; how to overcome this contradiction is an inevitable path for the development of scientific work plans and scientific work itself.

4. Due to the prevalence of mechanical materialism, many scientists from capitalist societies tend to be conservative and find no way forward.

5. Due to the prevalence of subjective and relative idealism, many scientists from capitalist societies tend towards pessimism and mysticism.

The second layer of thought imprints includes the following points:

1. Due to the past influence of semi-colonial thoughts, our Chinese scientists often lack self-confidence and self-respect. They tend to seek the approval of foreigners rather than strive for self-reliance in scientific research within the country.

2. Due to the aforementioned reasons, many valuable works in China's scientific community are published abroad or in Chinese using foreign languages; Chinese people do not benefit from them.

3. Due to the residual influence of feudal and semi-colonial thoughts, sectarianism is created, and unity is destroyed.

4. Due to the past reactionary rule, scientific work was merely for show and detached from production, creating a bad habit of not being practical.

These two layers of thought obstacles sometimes intermingle and exacerbate each other. They can appear in various forms and unexpected variations in our thoughts.

These stubborn, reactionary, and chaotic thoughts, along with the crude forms of thought related to them, have, in the past two years, been eliminated in social consciousness due to the consolidation of the people's power and the rapid development of the people's democratic dictatorship. The anger of the liberated Chinese people has destroyed them. However, we must remember: wild horses and dust are not impossible to gather; the embers of a dead fire are not without the possibility of reigniting, especially when people recognize that natural science does not belong to the superstructure and easily forget the decaying superstructure, which seriously threatens the development of natural science, we must be careful, fearing that a dark corner in the library or laboratory might hide the ghost of Wu Tingfang.

Only by widely, deeply, and enthusiastically launching a patriotic movement from the family to the school, from the factory to the field, can we thoroughly eliminate the dust and clear the shadows of feudal and comprador remnants, laying the foundation for our dignified national form. Only by overthrowing empiricism, all idealism, mechanical materialism, and the theory of knowledge limits, as well as dogmatism; only by seriously studying Mao Zedong Thought, especially tenaciously studying "On Practice," and thus experiencing the effectiveness of Marxism-Leninism in our work and daily life, can we thoroughly liberate and organize our thoughts, and consolidate our ideological front.

Comrades! Look at the heroic and moving performances of our excellent sons and daughters of the motherland on the Korean battlefield; look at the hundreds of thousands of peasants, marching in vast numbers, completing the initial work of the Huai River project in just one year, as well as other great achievements across the country. I do not believe I am wrong if I say: these great achievements are all the fruits of our initial victories on the ideological front.

On this consolidated ideological front, as long as we wage a more tenacious struggle, we will undoubtedly quickly achieve even greater victories. The brilliant future is not something we can easily imagine today.

Long live the victory of the world's people armed with Marxism-Leninism!

Long live the victory of the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live our ideological leader, Chairman Mao!

**Speech by Ulanfu, Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government**

**Inner Mongolia People's Continued Support for the People's Volunteer Army**

Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, Members, and Comrades:

At this third session of the first National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, I have heard Chairman Mao's opening speech, Premier Zhou's political report, and reports on anti-American aid to Korea, financial and economic work, and cultural education work. I fully agree with and support them. In particular, Chairman Mao's proposal to continue strengthening anti-American aid to Korea, increase production, practice thrift, and support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is extremely in line with China's current struggle situation and the will of the people nationwide. The people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region resolutely unite with the people of the entire country to achieve this central task and strive for an early victory in the anti-American aid to Korea.

The purpose of the American imperialists in launching the war of aggression against Korea is to attempt, through war, to turn the entire Korean Peninsula into their colony and further invade our country. Defending our country and resolutely opposing American imperialist aggression and supporting the Korean people have become the sacred duty of the people of all ethnic groups in our country.

Therefore, since the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea, the people of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have been closely following the situation of the Korean War and the security of our country and immediately responded to the call of the Chinese People's Association for Resistance Against America and Aid to Korea, launching the patriotic movement of resistance against America and aid to Korea.

Over the past year, the people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have shown unlimited enthusiasm in the anti-American aid to Korea movement. The broad masses have expressed their love and support for Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, and the Central People's Government in various practical actions; they have shown their deep love for the great motherland; they have made due efforts to support the front line and build and consolidate our great motherland. We have conducted a large-scale donation campaign to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army and aid Korean refugees, donating 13 billion yuan in cash, 1.7 million jin of grain, and a large number of comfort bags and letters.

In various cities, towns, forests, villages, and grasslands in the autonomous region, we have held various meetings to expose the atrocities of the Japanese invaders, American imperialists, and the Kuomintang bandits, and held various meetings to defend peace and oppose the rearmament of Japan by the United States. According to incomplete statistics, 1,744,595 people from various circles in Inner Mongolia have signed and voted in support of the five-power peace treaty and against the rearmament of Japan by the United States, accounting for 72.7% of the total population of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. On May 1st, International Labor Day, 1,350,000 people from cities and countryside participated in demonstrations, accounting for 56.25% of the total population of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Through these movements, the people of various circles have generally received a certain degree of patriotic education on resistance against America and aid to Korea, deepening their hatred and contempt for American imperialism, greatly enhancing their determination and confidence in resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending the motherland.

Currently, the people of various places in Inner Mongolia have increased production and income through donations of 14 aircraft, 3 cannons, and 12,100 yellow sheep to support the front line. The people of various places have also, according to different occupations, production, and work nature, established patriotic covenants in various government agencies, schools, villages, production, and work units, and various industries, and conducted one to two inspections and revisions. For the land of the families of martyrs and soldiers, we have universally implemented mutual assistance in farming, ensuring that the harvest of the families of martyrs and soldiers is not lower than that of the farmers themselves on the same land, and universally conducted an inspection of the work of caring for the families of martyrs and soldiers. Caring for and respecting the families of martyrs and soldiers has become a social custom. Through these efforts, the patriotic movement of resistance against America and aid to Korea has been further developed, not only deeply developed among workers, peasants, herdsmen, youth, and women, but also established patriotic covenants in the industrial and commercial circles, actively paying taxes and actively improving management, increasing income, and donating aircraft and cannons. In the Inner Mongolian Lamaism, we have also held a conference of representatives of resistance against America and aid to Korea, established a patriotic covenant for Lamas, and held various patriotic activities.

The patriotic movement of resistance against America and aid to Korea has powerfully promoted production and various aspects of work. Farmers and herdsmen have launched a patriotic movement to increase production and herds, and under the government's advocacy of organizing, fine tillage, and improving production technology, they have actively launched a patriotic production competition and actively fought against disasters. Herdsmen, under the government's policy of protecting pastures, free grazing, and increasing herds, have shown unprecedented enthusiasm for developing animal husbandry. This year, the breeding rate of various livestock in the pastoral areas averages 70% of the female livestock, the survival rate of young livestock reaches over 90%, and the net breeding rate of various livestock has exceeded the original plan of increasing by 11%. Workers in various factories and forest areas have significantly improved production efficiency in the patriotic production competition movement. The result of the large-scale suppression of counter-revolutionaries has severely struck the remaining counter-revolutionary elements, completely eliminated bandits, greatly raised class awareness, and consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship and the rear of resistance against America and aid to Korea.

Our future work is: to continue strengthening the work of resistance against America and aid to Korea, never relaxing our fighting spirit, using all our strength to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and striving for an early victory in the resistance against America and aid to Korea. Resolutely support the policies and all measures of the Central People's Government, strive to increase production, practice thrift, and complete various tasks of supporting the front line and various construction tasks. Universally inspect and revise patriotic covenants. Do a good job of caring for the families of martyrs and soldiers, ensuring that their land production and living standards are not lower than those of the general masses in rural areas; in cities, do a good job of introducing jobs and organizing production work.

This year, a large area of Inner Mongolia has suffered severe droughts, wind, frost, and other disasters, and production and disaster relief have become the current central task. We must resolutely implement the policy of self-reliance and production, mobilize the masses to vigorously engage in various sideline productions, launch material exchanges, and organize mass mutual aid movements. We must achieve the task of increasing income by 120,000 tons of grain. We must organize the people in disaster-stricken areas to produce actively with the patriotic enthusiasm of resistance against America and aid to Korea, overcome difficulties, reduce the burden on the state, and increase the strength of resistance against America and aid to Korea.

Although we have large areas suffering from severe disasters, the enthusiasm of the people for patriotic donations has not decreased. Based on self-reliance and production, we will strive to pay donations and ensure the completion of donation work, and strive to exceed it to support the front line in Korea.

To increase production, we are now preparing to prevent next spring's drought and overcome the losses to agriculture caused by this year's disasters, and are preparing for the recovery and development of agricultural production. For industry, forestry, animal husbandry, and other economic undertakings, we will further develop on the basis of several years of work. We will soon launch a campaign to simplify, economize, oppose extravagance, and combat corruption and waste throughout the region, making the state's finances achieve the greatest savings and avoid any waste, increasing the strength of resistance against America and aid to Korea and national construction.

Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, and the Central People's Government, the people of Inner Mongolia have been liberated and implemented ethnic regional autonomy, developed ethnic economy and culture, and fully enjoyed the rights of ethnic equality in the family of the People's Republic of China, where ethnic friendship and cooperation are cherished. Therefore, the relationship of equality, unity, friendship, and mutual assistance among various ethnic groups is increasingly consolidated and developed. The awareness of loving the motherland has greatly improved. The people of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region resolutely support the policies and measures of the Central People's Government, respond to the calls of the state, strive to increase production, and contribute all their strength to the cause of building and consolidating the great motherland of our various ethnic peoples, supporting the front line of resistance against America and aid to Korea, and striving for the final victory of the great struggle of resistance against America and aid to Korea. Over the past year, our work has had many shortcomings and mistakes, but we believe that under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, our work in 1952 will definitely be better than this year. Finally, I shout:

Long live the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Long live Chairman Mao!

**Speech by Li Da, President of Hunan University**

**Learning the Selected Works of Mao Zedong is an Important Task for Educators**

Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, Members, and Comrades:

The central theme of this session is resistance against America and aid to Korea, increased production and thrift, and another important theme is "learning the Selected Works of Mao Zedong and reforming thoughts." Therefore, I would like to speak on this topic and seek your guidance.

Chairman Mao, as early as 1937, in his essay "On Practice," said: "The proletariat and revolutionary people's struggle to change the world includes the task of achieving the following: changing the objective world and also changing one's subjective world—changing one's ability to recognize and changing the relationship between the subjective world and the objective world." This so-called "changing the subjective world—changing one's ability to recognize" is changing thoughts, changing thought methods and work methods. He also predicted that the Chinese people would go through such a process of change.

With the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution, Chairman Mao, in his essay "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" published on July 1, 1949, mentioned: "The people's state is a protector of the people. With the people's state, the people can, for the first time in the country and on a nationwide scale, use democratic methods to educate and change themselves, making themselves free from the influence of internal and external reactionaries (this influence is still very great and will exist for a long time, and cannot be quickly eliminated), changing the bad habits and bad thoughts they acquired from the old society, preventing themselves from going astray on the wrong path indicated by the reactionaries, and continuing to advance towards a socialist society and a communist society." Because the victorious Chinese people's revolution is a thorough and unprecedented change, the construction of the new state, whether in politics, economy, or culture and education, must follow Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, implementing fundamental reforms. This is sudden and requires re-learning for those who have been influenced by bourgeois ideology in the past. Indeed, since the establishment of the new state, the people of the whole country have been using democratic methods to change and educate themselves, learning the history of social development, learning the New Democracy, learning political economy, learning policies, and learning current affairs. Over the past two years, the thought reform of the people of the whole country has made remarkable progress, especially since last year, through the three major movements of resistance against America and aid to Korea, land reform, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the political level of the people of the whole country has indeed greatly improved. Therefore, Chairman Mao said in his opening speech at this session: "In the cultural and educational front and among various intellectuals in our country, according to the guidelines of the Central People's Government, a self-education and self-reform movement has been widely launched, which is also a new phenomenon worth celebrating in our country." He then instructed us: "Thought reform, especially the thought reform of various intellectuals, is an important condition for thoroughly implementing democratic reforms in all aspects and gradually carrying out industrialization in our country. Therefore, we wish this self-education and self-reform movement to achieve greater success in steady progress." Chairman Mao's instruction is solemn, great, and correct. We must accept this instruction and continue to strengthen the thought reform movement.

The development of the self-education and self-reform movement of the people of the whole country is uneven. Generally speaking, the thought reform of the working class is the most active and progressive because they have the farthest vision, are selfless, and are the most thorough in their revolutionary spirit. They have striven to develop production, shown creativity, and already created various types of machinery, cars, and other machinery, and appeared many labor models, which is a proof. Next, the thought reform of the peasants is also relatively progressive. They have made remarkable achievements in production, and the appearance of many agricultural labor models is also a proof. Originally, intellectuals, educators, and scholars who held petty-bourgeois and bourgeois thoughts have made great changes in their thoughts in the two years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, but we must admit that this progress still cannot meet the needs of the state and the people, and we must make further progress and strengthen our learning.

To achieve greater progress, to thoroughly reform the thoughts of cultural and educational workers across the country, we must respond to Premier Zhou's call in his political report: "Be armed with Mao Zedong Thought, which combines Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution! This is the new task of the Chinese people's democratic united front." He said: "At the time of the meeting of the National Committee, the first volume of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong has been published, and we must take on the responsibility of promoting the organization of learning the Selected Works of Mao Zedong in all aspects."

Comrade Liu Shaoqi said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the unity of the theory of Marxism-Leninism and the practice of the Chinese revolution, it is Chinese communism, Chinese Marxism." He also said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the continuation of the development of Marxism-Leninism in the current era of colonial, semi-colonial, and semi-feudal countries' national democratic revolutions, it is a model of the nationalization of Marxism." Mao Zedong Thought is the invincible theory guiding the revolution and state-building of China, which is completely proven by the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the achievements of the construction of the new state. Because of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese nation has become a nation with a scientific theory of revolutionary state-building, which is the glory of the Chinese nation and the pride of the Chinese people.

Now, the Selected Works of Mao Zedong has been published. This is a major event in the political and ideological life of the Chinese people and the world's people, and a major event in the global cause of Marxism-Leninism. We should celebrate and rejoice for this great political event!

Mao Zedong Thought is presented to our people through the Selected Works of Mao Zedong. People of all countries will translate the Selected Works of Mao Zedong as a textbook for learning Marxism-Leninism; we Chinese people must redouble our efforts to take the Selected Works of Mao Zedong as a textbook for learning Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, which is a matter of course.

As for the method of learning the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, I would like to humbly offer a few shallow opinions.

Chairman Mao has instructed us: "We learn Marxism-Leninism to 'learn to apply the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of Marxism-Leninism, seriously study the history of China, study the economy, politics, military, and culture of China, investigate and study each problem, and then create theories.' Now, we learn Mao Zedong Thought, and we must also follow this instruction, learn the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of Mao Zedong Thought, and solve various practical problems in revolution and construction. If we do not do this, but only memorize and recite the essays in the Selected Works of Mao Zedong without understanding and applying them, our achievement, if calculated in percentages, would be zero.

The standpoint of Mao Zedong Thought is the standpoint of the proletariat, its viewpoint is the viewpoint of materialism, and its method is the method of dialectics. Such a standpoint, viewpoint, and method run through all of Chairman Mao's works like a red thread. To learn the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of Mao Zedong Thought, I suggest starting with "On Practice." "On Practice" is the Marxist-Leninist epistemology of dialectical materialism, it is the scientific summary of Chairman Mao's thought and work methods, and the scientific summary of the experience of the Chinese people's revolution. If we understand "On Practice," we have obtained the key to understanding all of Chairman Mao's works, and then we can start learning Chairman Mao's works from the first and second periods of the domestic revolutionary wars, learning how Chairman Mao applied the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of Marxism-Leninism to solve various specific problems in the Chinese revolution, which will be of great help to our learning.

Next, we must grasp the several most important central issues solved in the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, such as: the relationship between the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, the general line of the Chinese revolution, the theory and policy of the New Democracy, the theory and policy of the proletariat leading the revolution, the theory and policy of the liberation of the peasants, the theory and policy of the revolutionary united front, the theory and policy of revolutionary war, the theory and policy of economy, culture, and education, the theory and methods of party building—all of these are the specific manifestations of Chairman Mao applying Marxism-Leninism to solve the problems of the Chinese revolution and state-building, and the specific applications and expansions of Marxism-Leninism in the Chinese revolution. We must focus on these central issues to learn the Selected Works of Mao Zedong.

To thoroughly understand the significance of each essay in the Selected Works of Mao Zedong and to make the learning effective, when learning, we must combine it with party history and the history of the Chinese revolution, learning how Chairman Mao solved the difficulties encountered in the revolutionary situation. Next, we should combine it with our own thoughts, combine it with our own work at our posts, and combine it with the policies and various construction situations of the country's economy, finance, culture, and education.

Comrades! We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, strengthen thought reform as an "important condition for thoroughly implementing democratic reforms in all aspects and gradually carrying out industrialization." Various organs and factories must indeed implement democratic reforms, and schools must also implement democratic reforms, that is, thoroughly reforming old education, implementing new education, using revolutionary spirit and methods to improve teaching content and methods, and quickly training various construction talents in large quantities, creating the conditions for industrialization. To achieve this, educators must speed up the learning of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, reforming their own thoughts. Therefore, we must respond to Premier Zhou's call, strive to learn the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, and arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought.

Marx said: "Educators must be educated." We educators must deeply understand: theory must be combined with practice, science must serve construction, and teaching must serve politics. Therefore, we must learn the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, reform our own thoughts, and then we can stand in front of the youth and lead them. Now, the progress of the youth is very fast, if we do not strive to reform our thoughts, the youth will definitely surpass us, and we will be left behind.

Comrades! The People's Republic of China is like a big ship, and all the people of China have already boarded this ship. Chairman Mao is the helmsman of this ship, leading us to ride the wind and break through the waves to the shore of communism. We, the people on this ship, must indeed follow the helmsman's instructions, do a good job at our posts, and at the same time, we must know the direction of the voyage and give full play to our initiative and creativity to strive for the early arrival at the beautiful shore. Therefore, learning the Selected Works of Mao Zedong and reforming our thoughts is the new task of the Chinese people's democratic united front!

**Speech by Du Guangyu, Vice-Chairman of the Songjiang Provincial Consultative Committee**

**The People of Songjiang Will Continue to Strive to Support Our Volunteer Army**

Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, Members, and Comrades:

I am very honored to attend the third session of the first National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and have heard Chairman Mao's opening speech and the reports of the central leaders. I fully agree with them and am willing to strive for the completion of the central tasks of this session.

In the past year, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, Songjiang Province has also achieved some results in the great struggle of resistance against America and aid to Korea. The Songjiang Provincial People's Representative Assembly Consultative Committee has united various ethnic groups and democratic strata, mobilized the strength of various ethnic groups and strata, and strongly supported the front line. Under patriotic political education, people's awareness has greatly improved. Many places can be heard saying: "For resistance against America and aid to Korea, for defending the motherland, there are people, there is grain, and there is money." In the past year, the number of volunteers from Songjiang Province who joined the army and the volunteer stretcher teams was very large. Among them, a batch of stretcher bearers totaling 24,000 people have won awards on the front line, accounting for 30%. Our province has also provided a large number of carts, cars, horses, and a large number of drivers, technicians, doctors, students, and military work team cadres to volunteer to serve on the front line. In response to the call of the Resistance Against America and Aid to Korea Association to donate weapons, the people of Songjiang Province have shown their patriotic enthusiasm, and Songjiang Province has now pledged to donate 51 fighter planes and 2 anti-aircraft guns, with the payment exceeding 80%, and it is guaranteed that the full amount will be paid by the beginning of November. The movement to establish patriotic covenants has also been vigorously launched. According to incomplete statistics, Songjiang Province now has more than 80,000 basic units with patriotic covenants. From the perspective of its role in increasing production, improving work efficiency, and strengthening learning, it is undeniable that it has great significance.

Under the patriotic education of resistance against America and aid to Korea, the peasants of Songjiang Province have launched a patriotic production movement. Although some areas suffered from floods this year, an 80% harvest can still be ensured. The total value of agricultural production this year will be 103.7% of last year's, and the yield per unit area has increased from 2,798 jin per mu to 2,826 jin. Therefore, the following new situations have appeared in rural areas: (1) The population with a living standard above that of middle peasants has accounted for about 70% of the rural population of the entire province; (2) The commercial grains and industrial raw materials planted in the entire province account for 50% of the total cultivated land area, and the rural commodity economy has shown significant development; (3) There are more than 150,000 agricultural mutual aid groups, and 90% of the peasants participate in mutual aid groups. Among them, 54 groups use Soviet-made horse-drawn agricultural tools, and more than 12,000 groups use new improved agricultural tools. The promotion of superior varieties accounts for 50% of the entire mutual aid group. The combination of agricultural and sideline industries in mutual aid groups, the division of labor and specialization of large-scale groups, accounts for more than 20%, and the further consolidation and improvement of agricultural mutual aid groups have a certain favorable foundation; (4) The income from sideline production of peasants has greatly increased. Our province's peasants have earned more than 410 billion yuan in this winter production alone, accounting for 20% of the total value of agricultural production in our province, already exceeding the total amount of public grain levies for the year. If calculated based on the annual sideline production income, it will be twice this number, that is, the total value of sideline production for the entire year can account for about 40% of the total value of agricultural production. These new situations in rural areas have further encouraged peasants to actively expand reproduction, and agricultural production must take big steps forward, and efforts must be made to improve agricultural technology to increase the yield per unit area. This is the general demand of the peasants.

Local industrial production has also developed under the patriotic production competition movement. The total value of industrial production of provincial direct enterprises in 1951 exceeded that of 1950 by 50%, and the quality of general products has also improved after a large-scale quality inspection. In the second half of the year, a movement to increase production and save resources to tap potential has been launched, and based on the original plan, Songjiang Province can increase production and save resources worth 245,000 tons of grain. Private enterprises have also developed under the leadership of the state economy. Taking Harbin City as an example, the total value of industrial production in the first half of this year was 130% of the same period last year, of which 64.5% was processed and ordered by the state. Although this is the case, industrial products still cannot meet the purchasing power of urban and rural people, so the patriotic industrial production movement must be vigorously launched and will definitely be launched vigorously.

With the development of industrial and agricultural production, state-owned commerce and cooperatives, as well as private commerce, have also shown significant development. Just taking cooperatives as an example: the number of cooperative members this year has increased by 25% compared to last year, the capital has increased by 20%, and cooperative members account for about 50% of the total population, and rural cooperative members account for 60% of the rural population. To further activate the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, it is necessary to strengthen the leading role of state-owned commerce and further develop cooperatives.

With the development of industrial and agricultural production, people's lives have gradually improved. In 1951, the purchasing power of our province's society increased by approximately 50.64% compared to last year, and next year, the purchasing power of the entire province's society will increase by 39% compared to this year. This can clearly show that resistance against America and aid to Korea, contrary to the wishes of the imperialists, has not only not made us unable to recover and develop economically, but has become a driving force for rapid economic development. This also further proves the superiority of the new democratic system.

Chairman Mao instructs us: "To continue this necessary and just struggle, we need to continue to strengthen the work of resistance against America and aid to Korea, increase production, practice thrift, and support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. This is the central task of the Chinese people today." This is completely correct and is the great wish of the people of the entire country. It is also the great wish of the people of Songjiang Province. I believe that this session, under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao, has been completely successful. It will undoubtedly inspire and mobilize the people of the entire country to strive for the victory of resistance against America and aid to Korea and will definitely achieve greater success in various construction projects of the people's democracy. I hereby represent the Songjiang Provincial Consultative Committee to pay tribute to the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao!

**Speech by Chen Jingyu, Representative of the Industrial and Commercial Circles**

**Serving Economic Construction Under the Leadership of State-Owned Economy**

Chairman, Members, and Gentlemen:

I represent the industrial and commercial circles to first express my highest respect and heartfelt thanks to Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, who have led our nation to victory.

We unanimously support Chairman Mao's call in his opening speech to continue strengthening resistance against America and aid to Korea, increase production, practice thrift, and support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army as our future central task, and we are willing to strive to respond to this great call and complete this sacred task.

We fully agree with Premier Zhou's pointing out that in the past sixteen months, the great cause of our people has achieved various new victories in the three major movements of land reform, resistance against America and aid to Korea, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and has indicated the direction we should strive for in the future. We have listened to Vice-Chairman Chen Chutong's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and Vice-Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the resistance against America and aid to Korea to defend the motherland, which has made us further understand the great power of the Chinese people, which is invincible, and the aggressive behavior of American imperialism will definitely be defeated by us, the Chinese people who love peace. Here, we especially pay tribute to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army because it is their glorious victories on the front line that have guaranteed the peaceful life of the people in the rear. We have listened to Vice-Premier Chen Yun's report on economic and financial work, and we feel extremely excited. Vice-Premier Chen Yun's report fully explains our great victories and potential deep production capacity on the financial and economic front in the past year. We have also listened to Vice-Premier Guo Moruo's report on cultural and educational work, which has made us understand that after more than a year of efforts, the political awareness and cultural level of the people of the entire country have been generally improved, and cadres have been cultivated for the progress and development of the motherland.

All the above glorious achievements prove the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought in the cause of the Chinese people, prove the correctness of the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and also prove the superiority of the people's democratic dictatorship.

Since liberation, Chinese industry and commerce, under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, have basically overcome the serious difficulties caused by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and after a year of the people's government's efforts to adjust industry and commerce, our business has recovered and developed; we businesspeople, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the help of all sectors of the people, have striven to learn, actively reformed, and made significant progress in political awareness, and also made various changes in business operations; however, the progress is uneven. Whether in the improvement of industry and commerce, the improvement of political awareness of businesspeople, or the organization and unity of the Chamber of Commerce, there are phenomena of unevenness. In the future, we must follow Premier Zhou's instructions, first of all, on the basis of the existing foundation, further strengthen the unity of businesspeople, especially make the Chamber of Commerce truly a healthy organization representing all businesspeople, including small and medium-sized businesspeople. Make businesspeople from various cities, strata, and industries widely and strongly united under the leadership of the state-owned economy, and strive to complete the economic construction of the new democracy. Second, we must more positively accept the leadership of the state-owned economy, more clearly establish the thought of relying on the working class, so that the development of our enterprises avoids blind competition, and the operation of our enterprises can give full play to greater strength. Third, although we have widely launched learning, it seems to lack system and depth. Premier Zhou instructs us to learn Mao Zedong Thought, taking the Selected Works of Mao Zedong as the main content of learning. After returning to various places, we must mobilize and organize businesspeople to systematically and plannedly learn the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, so that the broad businesspeople can improve their theoretical understanding, thoroughly eliminate the residual old democratic consciousness in our thoughts, and thoroughly implement Mao Zedong Thought in practical actions, so that our efforts to reform ourselves can achieve greater success.

Finally, we unanimously guarantee to take the resolutions of this session on the work of resistance against America and aid to Korea back to the broad businesspeople, launch propaganda and education, so that every businessperson can thoroughly understand the spirit of the resolutions, give full play to higher patriotic and internationalist enthusiasm than now, so that the implementation of the work of resistance against America and aid to Korea can achieve greater results than before. We must do this: through the movement of resistance against America and aid to Korea, rely on the wisdom of the working class, tap the powerful productive forces hidden within, save all the material and financial resources that should be saved, so that our great motherland can quickly become rich and strong in the struggle of resistance against America and aid to Korea, and strive for the safety of the motherland and the peace of the Far East and the world.

Let us once again thank Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government for their correct leadership, so that the national industrial and commercial people, who have suffered from the oppression of imperialism for a hundred years and the exploitation of feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism, can transform into serving the broad people to improve their living standards. Only in the era of Mao Zedong, can our national industry and commerce have such a glorious future. Finally, let us shout:

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Long live Chairman Mao!

**Speech by Zhou Zhenlin, Democratic Personage**

**Cheering for the Brilliant Achievements of the Great Motherland**

Chairman, Members, and Comrades:

I am very honored and excited to attend this grand meeting of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. In the meeting, we have heard Chairman Mao's opening speech, Premier Zhou's political report, and the important reports of various leaders. I sincerely support Chairman Mao's wise instructions and fully agree with the reports of the conference. This has made me further understand that in the two years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, especially in the past year of resistance against America and aid to Korea, land reform, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the Chinese people, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, have achieved brilliant victories on all fronts. The Chinese people have unprecedentedly united, and the people's democratic dictatorship has been consolidated. The People's Republic of China is today a strong country in the world peace and democratic camp and a powerful pillar in the East for defending peace. Today, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army can powerfully resist the crazy aggression of American imperialism on the Korean battlefield together with the Korean People's Army and achieve great victories. This is an inevitable result. Here, I want to cheer for the brilliant achievements of the great motherland!

I come from Hunan, so let me talk about the situation in Hunan: In the two years since Hunan's liberation, with the development of the national victory situation, various aspects of work have also achieved great results: now, the open activities of bandits and spies in the entire province have been eliminated; after the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the social order in Hunan has been completely restored; land reform has been completed in most areas of the province, and the remaining few areas will be completed this winter and next spring; the movement of resistance against America and aid to Korea is continuing to deepen and expand; patriotic covenants have gradually been universally established and are being inspected and implemented; the movement to increase production and donate weapons has already completed the payment of more than 10 billion yuan and will complete and exceed the pledge of 103 fighter planes this winter; under the inspiration of patriotic enthusiasm for resistance against America and aid to Korea, the broad masses of workers and peasants have launched a patriotic production movement, making this year's rice production increase by 15 billion jin, approximately 11%, and next year it may reach and exceed the pre-war production level; local industry is also rapidly recovering and developing; other cultural and educational undertakings have also made new progress; at the same time, the awareness of various revolutionary classes, various democratic parties, and the broad masses of society has been improved, and unity has been strengthened. Hunan is Chairman Mao's revolutionary hometown, and the people of Hunan, with a glorious revolutionary tradition, are full of confidence in victory, continuing to advance for the construction of a new Hunan, for the defense of the motherland and the cause of world peace.

The above are just the facts I have seen and known, which are enough to prove the superiority of the people's democratic dictatorship. Looking back at my early years following Dr. Sun Yat-sen in the national revolution, for decades, the goal was also to seek the prosperity and strength of China, but it was not successful and was destroyed by the reactionary clique of Chiang Kai-shek in the middle of the road. Today, the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution has not only changed the direction of Chinese history but also changed the direction of Asian history. This is indeed the victory of Chairman Mao leading the Chinese people to carry out the new democratic revolution, which is also the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Seeing the current national victory, thinking of the past failure, I am deeply moved. Although I am 77 years old this year, I have always stood on the side of opposing imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits. I am willing to work with everyone to contribute my strength to the people's cause. At the same time, I am extremely enthusiastic about hoping that various democratic parties, democratic personages, ethnic minorities, and the people of the entire country will be more closely united under the banner of Mao Zedong, continue to strengthen the work of resistance against America and aid to Korea, increase production, practice thrift, actively support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and strive for the final victory of resistance against America and aid to Korea, for the construction of the motherland, and for the defense of world peace!

Finally, I congratulate the conference with great excitement!

Long live the great unity of the Chinese people!

Long live Chairman Mao!

**Speech by Li Chang, Representative of Youth Workers**

**Strive to Learn Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought**

Chairman, Members, and Representatives:

We are very inspired after hearing Chairman Mao's opening speech, Premier Zhou's political report, and the reports of Comrades Chen Chutong, Peng Zhen, Chen Yun, and Guo Moruo. In the past year, our country has achieved great achievements in the three major movements of resistance against America and aid to Korea, land reform, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, as well as on other fronts. It makes us deeply feel that living in the era of Mao Zedong is a great blessing. We must redouble our efforts to welcome the current tasks and not disappoint the expectations of the motherland and the people.

Here, on behalf of the youth of the entire country, I would like to express my highest respect and heartfelt thanks to Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, and the Central People's Government, and extend my fighting greetings and warm regards to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

The youth of China, under the wise leadership and sincere care of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, and under the education of patriotism and internationalism, have continuously improved their thoughts, political level, culture, and scientific and technological knowledge, and have been able to fully display their labor, courage, and wisdom in various fronts to build meritorious deeds for the motherland.

In the past year, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the youth of the entire nation have been mobilized on an unprecedented scale. They have played a tremendous and active role in the cause of defending and building the motherland. Because of this, the youth have raised and carried out the following slogans: "Where the motherland needs us is our post." For example, when mobilizing to join the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and various military academies, the number of young people volunteering always exceeded the predetermined recruitment quota. The vast majority of rural youth actively participated in the land reform struggle, and after the land reform, they actively participated in democratic governance. According to statistics from the Central South Region, among the grassroots cadres in rural areas, youth account for about one-third; in Northeast China, 92% of young workers participated in the patriotic production competition; in the railway sector, 35,843 youth league members received various forms of administrative rewards in 1951, accounting for 69.4% of all league members on the railway; in the massive Huai River conservation project, youth accounted for 40% of the total labor force; students have made significant progress in political and ideological studies and in eliminating imperialist and feudalist thoughts. This year, graduates from higher education institutions have voluntarily complied with the state's unified job allocation.

Under the banner of patriotism, in the past year, many new heroes and models have emerged among the youth: such as the 19-year-old youth league member Zeng Nansheng, who bravely and cleverly intercepted the enemy on the front lines of Korea and was awarded the title of "Youth Hero"; the model league member Cao Dianying and his five comrades, who bravely fought in dire situations, took command of the battle, and defended the position for ten hours, repelling eight enemy attacks and killing nearly a hundred enemy soldiers; Zhang Baofu, who used four hand grenades and a box of explosives to destroy two enemy tanks and four trucks, and was awarded a special merit; Wang Renshan, who safely drove a car for 46,000 kilometers under enemy air raids and was awarded the military medal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea; the model nurse Han Mei, who was awarded a major merit. On the land reform front, Li Yuefei, the militia leader and league member of a certain village in Shangrao, Jiangxi, was awarded the title of "Jiangxi Militia Special Hero" for his active participation in the land reform struggle and his bravery in capturing fourteen armed landlords during the landlords' counterattack. On the front of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the young worker Zhu Wenxiu of the Northeast Workers' Patrol Team fought with two spies who infiltrated the factory to set fires and sabotage at night, killing one and causing the other to flee; Zhu Wenxiu, who was injured while protecting the factory, was awarded the title of "Factory Protector." The seven young heroes in Tianjin, Hu Chengzhi and others, bravely and wisely captured spies. The female student Lu Chengxiu in Shanghai, despite threats from spies, announced that her father, the big spy and a major criminal of the Kuomintang concentration camp in Shangrao, Lu Xu, was her enemy, and stood on the side of the people's daughter to severely denounce Lu Xu's various crimes. On the production front, He Jianxiu, who created a new spinning method; the No. 1008 locomotive crew led by Qiao Yuyan, who set a record of 1,113.8 kilometers per day; the Liu Lifu advanced group in Dalian, which completed its tasks 533% over quota and with all products meeting specifications in the twenty months from last year to this August; the Li Junting group in Jiawang Coal Mine, Shandong, which set a national coal mining record; the first-class models Gan Caixia and Jin Xiulan in the Huai River conservation project, as well as the people's teacher Shi Ruifen, and many other youth heroes and models. They represent the countless outstanding youth of the motherland. It is also worth mentioning that the Liu Zhi group in the Northeast production and savings movement. They completed a half-year plan of increasing production by 12 billion yuan in just three months. In July and August, they proposed and adopted fifteen rationalization suggestions, one of which was the use of small pieces of coke and returned coke, which would increase the wealth of the motherland by 4.24 billion yuan by the end of the year. This shows the enormous potential power in the laboring people and the youth.

In the past year, the unity and friendship between Chinese youth and Soviet youth, youth from various people's democratic countries, youth from various countries in Asia, and youth from around the world who love peace have been further developed and consolidated. International youth organizations and youth from various countries sent nine delegations (a total of 35 youth representatives from 30 countries) to China. We have sent representatives and delegations of the youth and young pioneer teams abroad 18 times. In particular, the youth representatives and the youth art troupe that participated in the Third World Youth and Student Peace Festival this year have gathered with youth from 104 countries. Due to the mutual visits and contacts between Chinese youth and youth from various countries, youth who love peace from various countries have a deeper understanding of the great power of the Chinese people and their strong determination to defend peace. Youth who love peace from all over the world regard the great victory of the Chinese revolution and the tremendous achievements of New China on various fronts as their own victories and achievements. They enthusiastically support our great struggle to resist America, aid Korea, and defend peace. At the Third World Youth and Student Peace Festival held in Berlin, Comrade Stalin and Comrade Mao Zedong received the most enthusiastic cheers from the youth of the world who love peace!

Now, the great struggle to resist America and aid Korea is still ongoing. To continue this struggle, Comrade Mao Zedong has pointed out that the central task of the Chinese people today is to continue to strengthen resistance to America and aid Korea, increase production, and practice thrift. We, the youth of the entire nation, resolutely respond to this call. We guarantee to implement the specific tasks outlined in the resolutions of this conference. For this purpose:

1. We will continue to develop and deepen patriotic education among the youth to resist America and aid Korea, to increase our hatred and strikes against American imperialism and all its spies, agents, and acts of aggression in China by a thousandfold, and to be ready to respond to the motherland's call at any time to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army on the front lines.

2. We, the youth of the entire nation, will actively participate in the patriotic production and savings movement and regard it as one of the main contents of the patriotic pact, to be implemented every day and every moment.

3. We will also strengthen the study of culture and science and technology to increase our strength in defending and building the motherland. At the same time, we will vigorously implement the Marriage Law to safeguard the immediate interests of young men and women, to promote their enthusiasm for patriotic production and labor.

For the sake of our great motherland, we will strive to do more and do better. We are well aware that striving to study and master Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is the key to our being able to successfully complete all tasks. Let us, together with the people of the entire nation, advance victoriously under the banner of Mao Zedong!

Long live our great motherland!

Long live our beloved leader and teacher, Chairman Mao!

Vice Chairman of the Central-South Military and Political Committee, Ye Jianying's Speech

The three major movements have achieved tremendous success in the South China region. Chairman, commissioners, comrades:

I fully support Comrade Mao Zedong's opening remarks, Comrade Zhou Enlai's political report, and the reports of other leaders. We accept the tasks assigned to us by the conference and will strive to unite the 49 million people of South China to resolutely carry out and complete these tasks. At the same time, we are inspired and celebrate the great victories achieved by our great motherland in the past year in resisting America and aiding Korea, as well as the tremendous achievements on the financial and economic, cultural, and educational fronts.

Regarding the work of the Central-South Administrative Region, Comrade Peng Chun, Vice Chairman of the Central-South Military and Political Committee, has already reported to the conference. I will briefly report on the work situation in South China as a supplement to Comrade Peng's report.

In the past year and more, under the correct leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the Central People's Government, and the direct guidance of the Central-South Military and Political Committee, we have carried out a series of tasks to consolidate the people's power in Guangdong and Guangxi, consolidate national defense in South China, and mobilize the restoration of production. Here, based on the actual situation in South China, we have promoted the patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea and the large-scale suppression of counter-revolutionaries throughout South China; in rural areas, we have launched the anti-bandit, anti-tyrant, rent reduction, and debt repayment peasant movement to mobilize the broad masses of peasants, train cadres, and gradually enter the stages of confiscation, collection, and distribution of land; in Guangzhou and other medium-sized cities, we have carried out democratic reforms, eliminated feudal remnants, and established a reasonable production management system; along the coast, we have mobilized fishermen to fight against tyrants, organize anti-tyrant struggles, and carry out the work of organizing fishermen.

In the aspect of patriotic education to resist America and aid Korea, it has been promoted from cities to rural areas. We have used various opportunities and forms to vigorously eliminate the pro-American, pro-American, and anti-American thoughts among the masses, establishing the concepts of hatred, contempt, and disdain for American imperialism. As of today, the long-term poisoning and influence of imperialism on South China have been greatly weakened. This is reflected in the fact that 25 million people in South China have signed to support world peace and voted against the rearmament of Japan by American imperialism, and have supported the struggle to resist America and aid Korea with actual actions and strength; more than 100,000 young people and students in South China have volunteered to join the army and military academies; South China's two provinces and one city have donated 175 aircraft, with Guangdong Province donating 66 fighter jets, moving towards the goal of 100 aircraft; Guangxi Province has donated 53 aircraft; Guangzhou City has donated 56 aircraft. Workers and peasants have launched patriotic production competitions, and the business community has launched collective tax payment, patriotic donations, elimination of outdated practices, reform of industry and commerce, and promotion of urban-rural material exchange. The movement to resist America and aid Korea in South China has become a great patriotic movement, becoming a great driving force for promoting various actual tasks.

In the aspect of land reform: in the two provinces and one city of South China, approximately 9 million people have completed land reform. After the successful completion of land reform in the suburbs of Guangzhou City, the focus has shifted to the patriotic production movement; in Guangdong Province, 13 counties with nearly 5 million people have completed land reform this spring, and now the focus is on the half of the province's population, or 15 million people, relying on the People's Liberation Army to dispatch a large number of cadres, in conjunction with local cadres, to launch the anti-bandit, anti-tyrant, rent reduction, and debt repayment movement. After the autumn, the focus will shift to land reform; in Guangxi Province, 10 counties have completed land reform, and 10 counties are partially carrying out land reform. The population in the land reform areas of the entire province has reached 420 million. In the future, we will continue to mobilize the masses and dispatch more intellectuals, young students, and working cadres to participate in land reform, strengthen urban support for rural areas, expand and consolidate the anti-feudal united front in rural areas, and strive to complete the land reform in South China by 1952 to welcome the high tide of national planned economic construction.

In the aspect of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, we have timely corrected the "leniency without bounds" tendency and implemented Comrade Mao Zedong's correct policy of combining suppression with leniency. We have launched a large-scale campaign to mobilize the masses and severely crack down on counter-revolutionaries, greatly boosting morale and suppressing the enemy's morale. Currently, we are focusing on completing the cleanup of accumulated cases and launching labor reform work. In rural areas where land reform has been completed and in cities where the suppression of counter-revolutionaries has been launched, we have universally established mass self-defense organizations to continue to deepen the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. In the aspect of anti-banditry, since the liberation of South China, we have successively eliminated more than 700,000 bandits and seized nearly 1 million guns. In Guangdong Province, 270,000 bandits have been eliminated and 500,000 guns have been seized; in Guangxi Province, 470,000 bandits have been eliminated and 440,000 guns have been seized, basically eliminating the banditry that has never been eliminated in the history of Guangdong and Guangxi. At the same time, in conjunction with coastal defense, border defense, and fishery work, we have not only eliminated the garbage but also repaired the doors, that is, we have not only severely cracked down on various counter-revolutionaries in South China but also further consolidated coastal and border defense. The overall revolutionary order in South China can be said to have basically stabilized. However, due to the collusion of American and British imperialism with the Kuomintang bandits, using Hong Kong and Macau, they continue to send spies and henchmen to infiltrate the mainland. Therefore, in the future, in addition to continuing to implement the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in cities and rural areas, we must also use sufficient strength to shift to the rivers and coasts, organizing 1 million fishermen to thoroughly eliminate the enemies hiding in the ends of the earth.

Under the high tide of the three major political movements to resist America and aid Korea, land reform, and suppress counter-revolutionaries, the people of South China have also achieved great success in restoring production, completing financial tasks, strengthening currency management, and vigorously promoting material exchange in various production and construction and transportation construction tasks. More than 3,500 kilometers of highways have been repaired and strengthened with national defense functions. The water conservancy construction projects in Guangdong Province in one year have exceeded the total of the water conservancy projects of the Kuomintang reactionary regime in more than 20 years. This year, the early rice harvest has increased by 10% compared to the same period last year, and the late rice harvest is generally bountiful. Other economic crops and mineral resources have also increased significantly. Guangxi has built more than 900,000 mu of irrigation, increasing grain production by 10%. We have established the Huangpu Port and improved the customs work. Currently, we have basically eliminated the historical smuggling, and the types of smuggled goods have been reduced to a few items with extremely high profits and very small volumes; according to the report of the Guangzhou Customs, among the seized items, watches, small hardware, Western medicine, and saccharin account for more than 53%, and bulky items have almost disappeared. We have launched a financial struggle against imperialism, basically driving out the 500 million yuan of Hong Kong currency that has been circulating in South China for a long time. Currently, Hong Kong currency is only secretly used in a few areas along the border with Hong Kong and Macau and on some offshore islands, and has lost its circulation function. It is estimated that there are only 30 to 50 million yuan of Hong Kong currency remaining in Guangdong, mostly in the hands of overseas Chinese relatives as a means of storage. Recently, due to the development of rural struggles, farmers have exchanged large amounts of gold and silver (the fruits of the struggle) for banknotes, thus bringing a large amount of Renminbi into rural areas. We have firmly controlled prices and maintained continued price stability. We have settled more than 10,000 returned overseas Chinese, enabling them to participate in various jobs or studies. Incidentally, the special products exchange conference is currently being held in South China. We attach great importance to this work. We regard the special products exhibition as a comprehensive review, investigation, publicity, and exchange of the economic strength of the South China region. On the one hand, it is used to further activate the urban-rural economy and promote industrial and agricultural production; on the other hand, it is used to carry out the struggle against imperialism and feudalism and to make some necessary preparations for future planned production.

In the entire process of work, we have produced many shortcomings and errors; and as the work continues to develop, we feel more and more the weight of our responsibilities. However, we believe that under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Central People's Government, as long as we, all the working cadres, can seek truth from facts, connect with the masses, insist on truth, observe discipline, and seriously study Mao Zedong Thought and style, then although the tasks are arduous, they can still be completed.

I wish the conference a great success! I wish Comrade Mao Zedong a long life! I wish all the commissioners and comrades good health!

Minister of the Central People's Government North China Affairs Department, Liu Lan Tao's Speech

"Carry Forward the Revolutionary Tradition, Strive for Greater Glory" Chairman, commissioners, comrades:

I fully agree with and support Comrade Mao Zedong's opening remarks, Comrade Zhou Enlai's political report, and the reports of other leaders. These instructions and reports are very timely and important for the people's governments at all levels in North China and for all the people. We will formulate plans based on the actual situation in North China, organize forces, and mobilize all the people to implement and realize them.

First of all, we wholeheartedly support the seven resolutions of this conference on the work to resist America and aid Korea, and we are ready to respond to the motherland's call at any time, continuing to mobilize manpower, material resources, and financial resources to actively complete all tasks to support the front lines in Korea. The people of North China, during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, have honorably fulfilled their duties to the motherland; in the just struggle to resist America and aid Korea to defend the motherland, they can also fulfill their duties.

Secondly, we will use greater efforts to develop production and strengthen construction to enrich our national defense forces. In the past year, under the slogan of patriotic production and savings to resist America and aid Korea, our total industrial output and total agricultural output have both increased significantly; the production levels of most state-owned enterprises have exceeded the highest annual records in history, with some exceeding one or even several times. Due to the deepening of the patriotic production and savings and democratic reform movements, the great creativity of the working class has been further unleashed: for example, workers in Tianjin have independently manufactured medium-speed diesel engines and trolleybuses; the Taiyuan Machinery Factory has created a 65-horsepower coal-cutting machine; the Ma Liuji production team in Datong Coal Mine has created a new national record for fast tunneling. Currently, we are carrying out the work of cleaning up assets and verifying funds, etc., to lay a solid foundation for the preliminary implementation of the economic accounting system in state-owned enterprises next year. After this conference, we will concentrate more efforts to strengthen the leadership of industrial production, select and train more cadres to participate in industrial construction, to welcome the arrival of the large-scale economic construction period in the motherland.

Agricultural production in North China, after three or four years of land reform, has generally reached the production level before the War of Resistance Against Japan. Cotton production has exceeded the pre-war level by 55%. Last year, the entire region's farmers had the equivalent of 700 million jin of original grain in local products, which have already been sold, improving the living standards of farmers and significantly increasing their purchasing power. However, the so-called pre-war agricultural production level refers to the production level under the oppression of imperialism, feudal forces, and the Kuomintang reactionary regime, which is a very miserable production level in history. Farmers in North China have clearly shown that they are not satisfied with such a production level and are demanding and striving to break through this old production level, seeking to expand reproduction. The current central issue of expanding reproduction in North China is to expand the output per unit area. Labor models in various places have created many advanced experiences in this regard, inspiring the broad masses of laboring farmers to move towards organization, mutual aid, cooperation, patriotic abundance, and clothing and food security. For example, the national agricultural labor model Li Shunda has achieved a corn yield of 980 jin per mu under difficult conditions of poor land; the labor model Zhang Xishun in Hebei Province has achieved a grain yield of 1,300 jin per mu; the labor model Qu Yaoqi in Shanxi Province has achieved a cotton yield of 920 jin per mu; the labor model Ma Guorong in Hebei Province has achieved a sweet potato yield of more than 10,000 jin per mu. To meet the farmers' demand for expanding reproduction, we have formulated ten agricultural construction plans and are gradually implementing them. On the basis of the rapid recovery and development of industrial and agricultural production, urban-rural material exchange and public-private trade have also seen significant development.

This year, agricultural production in North China has suffered serious drought, pest, and frost disasters. Our agricultural increase is the result of fighting against these serious natural disasters. In the fight against aphids and locusts this year alone, more than 100 million man-hours were mobilized. Disasters have given us great difficulties, but due to Comrade Mao Zedong's personal care, the state's strong support, and the great spirit of "man can conquer nature" of the broad masses of laboring people, we have the confidence and methods to gradually overcome these difficulties.

Thirdly, further strengthen and consolidate our people's democratic dictatorship. In the past year, we have resolutely implemented the "Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries" issued by the Central People's Government, mobilized and relied on the enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people, suppressed the evil activities of counter-revolutionaries, and various sectors of the people are jubilant and delighted, saying: "This is truly another liberation," "It is more refreshing than a heavy rain." This has greatly improved the political awareness and production enthusiasm of the masses, further consolidating the unity within the people. For places where the suppression is not thorough or where the masses are not sufficiently mobilized, we are currently conducting a thorough investigation in conjunction with other work, eliminating new complacency, continuing to capture fugitives and thoroughly eliminating counter-revolutionaries who have slipped through the net, to protect the lives and property of the people and various construction tasks. We have implemented suppression and dictatorship against the enemy; within the people, we have implemented extensive democracy. From the perspective of North China, people's democratic dictatorship has been further consolidated and has proven its superiority in all aspects. In the past year, the work of people's representative assemblies at all levels in North China has made significant progress. To further expand the mass base of the people's government, strengthen the leadership of the working class, and strengthen and consolidate the basic system of our state, under the leadership of the State Council, we recently held a county magistrates' conference in the North China region, deciding that, except for a few counties and banners in Suiyuan, all counties and banners in various counties and banners will, in a planned and organized manner, act as people's representative assemblies this winter and next spring, elect county magistrates, deputy magistrates, and county people's government commissioners, to more broadly and closely connect with the people of various democratic classes, and better complete our various tasks.

In the large-scale struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries and the extensive promotion of people's democratic life, the people of North China have more deeply felt that democracy within the people and dictatorship over the enemy are united and inseparable, like the two wheels of a cart and the two wings of a bird.

Fourthly, under the conditions of improved living and heightened political awareness, the people of North China universally and enthusiastically demand that we strengthen cultural and health work. This was also felt by the Central Old Revolutionary Base Visiting Team after visiting various rural areas in North China. Everyone is eager to learn to read, learn to write, learn scientific knowledge; they want to quickly establish middle schools, normal schools; they want new entertainment; they want more pharmacies and hospitals; they especially hope that we will pay attention to maternal and child health, promote new childbirth methods. These demands are worthy of great attention. We plan to establish middle schools, normal schools, and agricultural technical schools in various provinces under the unified planning of the provincial people's governments, either by a single county or by several counties jointly. In various counties, we will organize doctors' associations, establish medical stations with key points, unite Chinese and Western doctors, travel to rural areas to treat the masses; train a large number of midwives to reduce infant mortality. We sincerely hope that more intellectuals and doctors from the cities can go to the countryside to work, and we warmly welcome drama troupes, art troupes, and film teams from the cities to frequently go to the countryside to promote and strengthen cultural and health work in rural areas.

Fifthly, to ensure the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea, the stability of finance, the development of production, and the political health of cadres, it is also necessary to launch the work of increasing production, practicing thrift, opposing waste, and severely punishing corruption in North China. This is a very important political task. We plan to combine it with the rectification work of all cadres in the region this winter, encouraging those who wholeheartedly serve the people, cherish public property, and are honest and upright; exposing, criticizing, and correcting those who are irresponsible to the state and the people and wasteful; punishing and severely punishing those who are corrupt and degenerate.

The instructions given to us by the conference are our glorious tasks, but they also increase our responsibilities. I believe that under the wise leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, relying on the unity and tireless learning of Mao Zedong Thought by all the people of North China, these tasks can be completed. Finally, let me use Comrade Mao Zedong's inscription for the people of the old revolutionary base, "Carry Forward the Revolutionary Tradition, Strive for Greater Glory," to encourage ourselves and conclude my speech.

Professor Huang Jiadi of Shanghai Medical College's Speech

Determined to Use All Forces to Cure the Wounded and Sick Soldiers Chairman, commissioners, comrades:

At this conference, we have heard Comrade Mao Zedong's opening remarks and the reports of various leaders. I represent the medical workers present to express our enthusiastic support. Comrade Mao Zedong clearly instructed us to strengthen the work to resist America and aid Korea, which is the central task of the Chinese people today. Without a doubt, this is even more the central task of medical workers who directly support the front lines. We medical workers must resolutely stand with our brave People's Volunteer Army on the front lines of resisting America and aiding Korea!

Since the American imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea and occupied our Taiwan, bombing our Northeast, the entire nation's medical workers have been swept up in the great movement of resisting America and aiding Korea to defend the motherland. When our volunteers, for the safety of the motherland and to support the Korean people in resisting American imperialist aggression, appeared on the battlefield in Korea, medical workers across the country voluntarily signed up to join the volunteer medical and surgical teams to resist America and aid Korea. Now, more than 3,000 medical workers have joined this glorious cause.

In the work, all medical workers supporting the front lines have shown boundless enthusiasm. When the task arrives, they work day and night to clean, tidy, examine, and change dressings for the wounded and sick, working together without distinction, striving to complete the task within a certain time. During busy times, they can work continuously for 36 hours. To take care of seriously wounded soldiers, they can stay up all night, sacrificing their sleep. To ensure that the wounded and sick can eat hot meals, they can go without eating. To ensure that the wounded and sick recover their health as soon as possible, they do not care about their own health, working while sick. Some medical personnel have even been infected, but this does not stop other comrades from working even more seriously and enthusiastically.

They all have boundless love for the wounded and sick. The pain of the wounded and sick is their pain. To relieve the pain of the wounded and sick, they can do anything. In addition to medical work, many comrades mend clothes, wash clothes, read newspapers, teach them to read, teach them to sing, help them with cultural and political studies. Many comrades even donate their blood to seriously wounded soldiers, helping them overcome crises and recover their health. We and the wounded and sick are not just the relationship of medical personnel and patients, but brothers of the same class.

In the work, there are not no difficulties. However, we will not yield to difficulties. Establishing a blood bank can ensure the supply of blood, so it is necessary in a hospital that often performs major surgeries during the reception of serious injuries. The necessary equipment for a blood bank is a refrigerator that can maintain a certain temperature. One medical team did not have a refrigerator and thought of using an underground cave. They measured the temperature inside and outside the cave at different times. The temperature outside the cave changes greatly during the day and night, but there is no change inside the cave, so they obtained the world's largest refrigerator. In experimental work, bacterial culture requires a warm box with a certain temperature. One medical team did not have a warm box and made a wooden box themselves, relying on the hospital's original fire wall. The temperature of the fire wall is not uniform. They used a rope to pull the wooden box up and down to obtain the appropriate temperature. These all show that the medical workers supporting the front lines can exert their creativity and overcome all difficulties.

We are not only doing these things ourselves, but we are also uniting with the medical cadres in the army who work with us, learning from each other and making progress together. We deeply feel that our numbers are limited, and our abilities are also limited. Only by teaching our technology to more comrades can more wounded and sick be better cured. Therefore, each member of the medical team teaches everything we know without reservation to the army comrades, and at the same time, we also learn their hardworking, persevering, and overcoming difficulties work style.

Comrades, the work on the front lines has deeply educated every medical worker. Facing us are the extremely brave Chinese People's Volunteer Army. They have contributed their entire lives for the motherland. When they come to the hospital with bloodshed and injuries, they are so unassuming and unpretentious, obeying treatment and resting in peace. When they recover from their injuries and illnesses, they are so happy to return to the front lines. They have not a moment of thought for themselves, but not a moment of thought for the motherland. When a person wakes up from anesthesia but is not fully awake, they will not say false words. At this time, our wounded soldiers have only two words: one is "Kill, kill the American devils!" and the other is "Long live Chairman Mao!" We have heard these two words over and over again, but each time they move our hearts. In such work, we deeply understand what it means to "serve the people wholeheartedly!"

The work on the front lines has also strengthened our understanding of the combination of technology and politics. We have seen with our own eyes the great rivers and mountains of the motherland, and we have also seen that workers and peasants across the country are actively producing, and people across the country are actively supporting the front lines. China has achieved unprecedented unity, and China has realized true unity in history. We have also seen with our own eyes how American imperialism brutally massacres the peaceful people of Korea and injures our brave People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army. American imperialism is determined to destroy the hard-won fruits of our victory and destroy the peaceful life that the people of the world unanimously demand. In such actual life, it has helped us to more sharply distinguish right from wrong, deepened our love for the motherland and the people, deepened our hatred for American imperialism, and therefore, it has also urged us to use all our strength to cure the wounded and sick so that they can quickly return to the front lines to fight the enemy. Therefore, our medical work is not just a simple technical task, but a concrete political task to strengthen combat power and ensure victory in combat!

Comrades, many medical workers have exerted their strength on the front lines, and many medical workers have educated and transformed themselves in actual work. While American imperialism has not yet received its final blow and is unwilling to admit defeat, the front lines need more medical workers. This is not only our sacred duty but also our glorious right! Let us unite and, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, bravely and resolutely march to the front lines to accelerate the final victory of resisting America and aiding Korea to defend the motherland!

Chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, Xie Xuehong's Speech

The Chinese People Are Determined to Liberate Taiwan from the Hands of American Aggressors Chairman, commissioners, comrades:

The New China led by Comrade Mao Zedong is glorious, great, and powerful. From the second session of the National Committee to the third session, in the 16 months, the achievements and progress made by New China in various aspects have fully demonstrated the expansion and consolidation of the Chinese people's democratic united front, and fully demonstrated the strength of New China!

I, on behalf of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, congratulate the conference on its success and pay the highest tribute to Comrade Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China!

I fully support Comrade Mao Zedong's political line in the opening remarks of the conference and fully agree with Comrade Zhou Enlai's political report and other reports, and I am determined to struggle to realize this line!

The political line indicated by Comrade Mao Zedong and the various reports at this conference are fully in line with the current domestic and international political situation and embody the great aspirations of the Chinese people to oppose American imperialist aggression, strive for peace, and work for national construction. This correct line will definitely be supported by the people of the entire country and will definitely achieve greater victories in the process of implementation than in the past. I would like to point out that the people of Taiwan who yearn for liberation, upon hearing the news of the National Committee's meeting and Comrade Mao Zedong's opening remarks, have directly seen the light and hope of liberating Taiwan, because the strength of New China and the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea on the front lines in Korea are the guarantee that Taiwan will definitely be liberated.

In the past year, the Chinese people's movement to resist America and aid Korea to defend the motherland has achieved brilliant victories. This is another great victory against imperialism after driving the forces of American imperialist aggression out of the Chinese mainland. This victory has also greatly inspired the fighting will of the Asian people, and this victory has strengthened the forces to defend peace in Asia and the world.

Comrade Mao Zedong said in the opening remarks of this conference: "Everyone knows that if it were not for the American army occupying our Taiwan, invading the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and attacking our northeastern border, the Chinese people would not fight against the American army." The people of Taiwan deeply understand the justice of resisting America and aiding Korea. They know that the victory of greatly annihilating the forces of imperialist aggression on the front lines in Korea will be a favorable condition for liberating Taiwan. The victory of resisting America and aiding Korea in the past year has further inspired the people of Taiwan, firmly believing that Taiwan will definitely be liberated, and has promoted them to prepare more for the liberation of Taiwan.

On the mainland, compatriots from Taiwan have actively responded to the motherland's call, enthusiastically joined the army, formulated patriotic pacts, donated wholeheartedly, and on the mainland, compatriots from Taiwan in the north and south have donated gold bracelets and jewelry, saved food and used it sparingly, actively produced, and actively participated in various political activities, showing their love for the motherland and their enthusiasm for the final victory.

The people of Taiwan are currently still under the joint oppression of American imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits, and their suffering is indeed very heavy. American imperialism has occupied Taiwan, turning it into a base for attacking New China and destroying world peace. The Kuomintang bandits are despicable and extremely shameless, relying on American imperialism to escape the punishment of the Chinese people. We think that an island with a population of seven million has become a nest for tens of thousands of American invaders and Kuomintang bandits. All means of plundering, oppressing, exploiting, and slaughtering are concentrated on the people of Taiwan. The joint crimes of American imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits are something that the Chinese people and the people of Taiwan cannot forgive and allow.

The people of Taiwan have fought against Japanese imperialism for half a century, and finally, together with the people of the mainland, they defeated Japanese imperialism. Based on this experience and the experience of long-term struggle to achieve victory, combined with the current strength of the motherland and the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea in the past year, the liberation of Taiwan will definitely be realized without a doubt! Based on the recent situation in Taiwan, the people of Taiwan have not surrendered, and the struggle against American invaders and the Kuomintang bandits has never stopped. The people of Taiwan are also preparing for the liberation of Taiwan. This can be reported to the elders, brothers, and sisters of the motherland!

We, the members of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, participating in various constructions on the mainland, deeply know that the people of the entire mainland and Comrade Mao Zedong and the leaders of the Central People's Government have not a moment of not caring for the people of Taiwan. We, the members of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, will convey the will of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Central People's Government to all the people of Taiwan and strive to prepare for the liberation of Taiwan. Our battle cry is what Comrade Zhou Enlai pointed out in the political report: "The Chinese people are determined to liberate Taiwan from the hands of American aggressors, and will not rest until the goal is achieved!"

Vice Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Consultative Committee, Wang Baozhen's Speech

Strive to Implement the Central's Policies and Seven Resolutions Chairman, commissioners, comrades:

I represent the Hebei Provincial Consultative Committee and am honored to listen to Comrade Mao Zedong's opening remarks. Comrade Mao Zedong's opening remarks instruct us to increase production, practice thrift, and support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army as the central task. We have also heard Comrade Zhou Enlai's report: "To systematically and extensively organize the study of Mao Zedong Thought." We fully support these two instructions. This not only strengthens the work of resisting America and aiding Korea; accelerates the construction of the people's democratic dictatorship; but is also a process of progress, enlightenment, unity, and awakening of the thoughts of the people of the entire country. At the same time, it is a step that must be taken to stabilize prices, develop the economy, guarantee the people's livelihood, and promote the common welfare of the new society, so we must firmly support it and strive for increased production and thrift, and strive for the organization of the study of Mao Zedong Thought. We have also heard the reports of Vice Chairman Chen Chun, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, Vice Premier Chen Yun, and Vice Premier Guo Moruo, as well as the resolutions on resisting America and aiding Korea. We fully support them and guarantee to strive to implement the central policies and these resolutions.

Now, I will briefly report on the work of the Hebei Provincial Consultative Committee in the past year and how we have striven to implement the central policies and decrees:

On November 1, 1951, the Hebei Provincial People's Government, led by Chairman Yang, convened the provincial people's representative conference. Nearly 600 representatives attended. On the first day of the conference, we passed a resolution to support the policy of resisting America and aiding Korea. Many labor model representatives proposed production competitions and support for the front lines. The entire conference unanimously launched the movement to resist America and aiding Korea. Seventy-five commissioners were elected to form the provincial consultative committee.

Since the establishment of the provincial consultative committee, the staff first organized a study group to study Mao Zedong Thought and Marxist-Leninist theory. In addition to the Standing Committee, three plenary sessions of the commissioners were held, and ten symposiums were held in conjunction with various sectors. Our committee has made every effort to assist government work and coordinate with various organizations to mobilize the people and promote the patriotic movement to resist America and aiding Korea as a regular and important work. To respond to the three calls of the National Resistance and Aid Korea Committee, to oppose the single-handed peace treaty with Japan by American imperialism, to support the speech of the Soviet representative at the San Francisco Conference, to support the wounded and donate, etc., our committee has issued six calls. Many representatives and county standing committees have actively responded to the calls of our committee and enthusiastically launched the movement. Many worker representatives, such as Zhang Jinman, Yu Shunzheng, and Sun Lianwang, have promoted the development of patriotic production competitions and proposed the slogan: "The factory is the battlefield, the machine is the gun, and more production is equal to more annihilation of the enemy." Farmer representatives, such as Gao Guandou, Sun Yufeng, and Qian Zhongren, have led the rural areas to launch the patriotic production movement and carried out large-scale anti-drought planting under the slogan of "Strengthen the country and enrich the family by planting more cotton."

Comrades, in April and May of this year, Hebei suffered a severe drought, and by the time of the summer solstice, only 700,000 mu of cotton fields had been planted. However, the central government gave Hebei the task of 1,400,000 mu. Chairman Yang, to complete the task, called for anti-drought planting. Men, women, and children in the countryside carried water to the fields to plant cotton, resulting in the completion of 1,700,000 mu, exceeding the task. However, they encountered a cotton aphid disaster, and one cotton plant had to be treated for aphids five or six times, resulting in the loss of nearly 200,000 mu. The cotton production of Hebei this year is estimated to be more than 300 million jin of lint, which can solve the clothing needs of 10 million people. However, we should think that every inch of cloth and every thread represent the labor and hardship of the people. To support resisting America and aiding Korea, to empathize with the hardship of the people and the difficulty of resources, we should strive to implement Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions: practice thrift.

In addition, school representatives such as Sun Kaishan and Wang Lianghong held expanded propaganda activities. Business representatives such as Wang Qicang, Li Yaotang, Shen Xili, Zhao Shaonong, Bai Tieshi, and Qiao Yuede promoted the business community to enthusiastically launch the patriotic movement. Many towns such as Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, Qinhuangdao, Xingtai, Tongzhou, Linqing, and Bozhou have launched patriotic tax payment competitions. Many youth, women, Hui, and religious representatives have also led and participated in this movement. Therefore, the movement to resist America and aiding Korea and sign patriotic pacts in our province has surged in every corner. Therefore, the people of Hebei Province, under the severe conditions of consecutive years of water, drought, and pest disasters, have donated 83 fighter planes.

Our committee has assisted the government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries, calling on representatives and county standing committees to actively assist the government in seriously implementing and executing the policy. Some have implemented democratic trials and sentencing in meetings, correctly implementing the policy and severely cracking down on the arrogance of counter-revolutionaries and upholding the righteousness of the people.

The land reform work in Hebei Province has been completed early. We have done two things to replace this movement:

1. We held an expanded meeting and invited dozens of business representatives to study and discuss the Trade Union Law and guarantee its effective implementation. We promoted the idea of relying on the working class to do a good job in production, launched the actual movement of labor-management cooperation, and launched the initial stage of workers participating in factory management.

2. This summer, our committee organized a rural observation team to visit the old revolutionary base area. After seeing the farmers who have undergone land reform, we saw that after liberation, they were united, helped each other, developed production and construction, and actively participated in resisting America and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, launching production competitions, and donating enthusiastically, showing a high degree of enthusiasm and political awareness. Farmers recognized that our government is truly a people's government.

Next, at the third plenary session of the Hebei Provincial Consultative Committee, we specifically studied and discussed Comrade Liu Shaoqi's speech at the third session of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference and the central decree on democratic governance. Based on the meaning of democratic governance, we made a resolution and promoted the work of democratic governance.

The work of our committee still has shortcomings, that is, the special committees have not been established, so many tasks have not been done well enough. We plan to organize and establish them in the future and hope that the National Committee will give clear guidance. This is also a key link in democratic governance, and we are willing to accept criticism and guidance.

The smooth progress of our various tasks is due to the fact that Chairman Yang and the CPC Provincial Committee, District Committee, and cadres at all levels have led everything by personal example in the local area. Our committee has only made every effort to assist in its progress. In general, it is due to the correct leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Central People's Government, and the policies and decrees formulated are completely in line with the will and demands of the broad masses of the people.

Now, on behalf of the Hebei Provincial Consultative Committee, I pay the highest tribute to the great and wise leader Comrade Mao Zedong, the Communist Party of China, the National Committee's commissioners and comrades, the combat heroes, and the labor model representatives.

Educator Representative Shi Ruifen's Speech

Use Revolutionary Methods to Overcome Difficulties and Do a Good Job in People's Education Chairman, commissioners, comrades:

We educators have heard Comrade Mao Zedong's opening remarks, Comrade Zhou Enlai's political report, and the reports of various leaders, and we unanimously support and resolutely implement them. Today, we educators are able to attend the National People's Political Consultative Conference, and we all feel greatly honored. Just take me as an example. I am a rural primary school teacher, and today I am not only able to attend the National People's Political Consultative Conference but also able to speak at the conference. This is something that never happened in the old society, and it is only Comrade Mao Zedong who has brought us light and happiness and opened up a broad future. We sincerely thank Comrade Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China!

New China is a revolutionary China, a people's China; new education is revolutionary education, people's education. We educators must use revolutionary methods to complete the glorious and arduous tasks entrusted to us by the motherland. What are revolutionary methods? To have the determination and courage to overcome all difficulties, to resolutely rely on the masses, to follow the mass line; and to constantly carry out self-criticism, to exert high creativity, and to serve people's education wholeheartedly. In the past few years, the people's education cause in the old and new revolutionary base areas has achieved such great achievements by using these revolutionary methods. I have personally experienced this in Qing Shui Tang Primary School.

Let me take my personal experience of managing Qing Shui Tang Primary School as an example:

Qing Shui Tang is a remote village 30 li northwest of Liyang County, Suzhou, which has suffered from the burning, killing, and looting of the Japanese invaders, and has also suffered from consecutive years of natural disasters and the oppression of the reactionary regime and landlords. Farmers have lived a miserable life all year round, and many young farmers have been infected with gambling and smoking. Therefore, it has the nickname of "village of good-for-nothings." After liberation, it encountered a bad year, and the best-off middle peasant family in the village, Li Xinfu, also had to live on barley gruel. Qing Shui Tang Primary School is an old, dilapidated ancestral hall without even a gate. The previous teacher was drunk and confused, slept late in winter, and enjoyed the cool breeze in summer. At the end of the winter vacation in 1949, only three children were left, and the school was almost closed.

I arrived at Qing Shui Tang Primary School to work on April 1, 1951. Those who were familiar with the situation in Qing Shui Tang were worried about me, saying that the place was too poor, there were few students, and it was previously a bandit's nest. However, my will was firm and unshakable, and I resolutely accepted this task. When I arrived in Qing Shui Tang, the farmers saw that I was a down-to-earth female teacher and commented: "A beggar has gone, and a beggar has come." Some even mocked: "The village will be rich this year, even the chicken can be used to invite the spirit (silkworm god)!" I heard these words and became even more determined in my will. I deeply thought: Didn't Comrade Mao Zedong instruct us to follow the mass line to overcome difficulties? Yes, to do a good job in people's schools, we must first blend in with the masses.

First, share the hardships with the masses. At that time, the masses were busy with production and disaster relief, so I asked someone to make a small clay stove and cooked my own meals in a small, dilapidated thatched cottage, also living on gruel with the masses, eating oil tree bark and red flower grass. Sometimes I chatted and laughed freely with the masses, drew patterns for them, calculated accounts, and wrote letters. A 63-year-old old woman said: "Teacher Shi has no airs, does not look down on people, and is truly a good teacher!" I gradually blended in with the masses in this way.

When the school opened, there were only 18 students. After understanding the reasons why they did not go to school, I mobilized and persuaded them and did my best to take care of them. By the summer vacation, the number had increased to 41. This spring, there were already 70 students. At the same time, I invited village cadres and parents to organize the school affairs committee to jointly overcome difficulties and do a good job in the school. Last summer, I returned to school from Suzhou after studying. The school affairs committee had already done a good job in recruitment and repaired the desks and chairs, just waiting for me to return to teach. This spring, the masses voluntarily helped the school to build school buildings and donated 210 laborers of carpenters, masons, and laborers, and reclaimed 8 mu of wasteland.

The vast majority of the people in Qing Shui Tang are illiterate. I often talked to them about the bitterness of not knowing how to read and write and encouraged them to learn culture. At that time, village cadres often went to the district to attend meetings, and because they could not read and write, they often forgot important matters, feeling the urgent need to learn culture. After the early rice was harvested, the farmers solved the funding problem by collecting firewood and fishing, and the winter school for literacy classes officially opened. As soon as the school opened, out of 61 students, only four were women. I visited each family to communicate with them and their husbands and parents, and suddenly 17 women signed up for the winter school. After the land reform, the masses were even more eager to learn culture, and the number of students increased to 116, with another 20-30 people listening. The winter school teaching was closely combined with the central work. For example, during the land reform, the land reform and anti-feudalism were used as the central content to communicate with the masses, to implement the land reform decree, and to smoothly complete the land reform work. Before the Spring Festival, the education of supporting the army and caring for the families of the wounded and sick was carried out. All 36 mu of military dependents' fields were plowed in advance by 81 members of the Farmers' Association. On New Year's Eve, the abundant New Year's gifts were sent to the families of the wounded and sick with drums and gongs. The current political situation was continuously propagated, the masses' confusion was clarified, the masses were mobilized to sign patriotic pacts, increase production, and donate aircraft and cannons, and the movement to resist America and aid Korea was vigorously launched. Moreover, a learning craze was stirred up, and everyone regarded teaching people to read and write as a glorious thing. After the winter school ended, through the selection of models and cultural complaints, the transition to the regular people's school was smoothly made.

My example is just one of the hundreds of thousands of people's teachers in the country. We firmly believe that in the current and future revolutionary and war environment, only by using revolutionary methods can we persist in people's education under any difficulties, and only then can we achieve the goal of development and improvement.

Comrade Mao Zedong's opening remarks, Comrade Zhou Enlai's political report, and the reports of other leaders have given us very important enlightenment and great encouragement. We educators guarantee that under the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought, we will be more united, carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, and for the long-term interests of the state, undertake the heavy task of cultivating the future generations of New China. We have full confidence and strength to complete this glorious task.

All teachers in the country, advance bravely under the brilliant banner of Mao Zedong!

Long live our great leader, Comrade Mao Zedong!

    人民政协全国委员会第三次会议十月三十日会上的发言
    编者按：在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议十月三十日会上，李四光、乌兰夫、李达、杜光预、陈经畬、周震鳞、李昌、叶剑英、刘澜涛、黄家驷、谢雪红、王葆真、史瑞芬等十三人的发言如下：
    人民政协全国委员会委员李四光发言
  　学习毛泽东思想发展自然科学建设祖国主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    请让我作为一个科学工作者，对于有关实现共同纲领第四十三条的一个基本问题，提供一点意见：共同纲领第四十三条说：“努力发展自然科学，以服务于工业农业和国防的建设。”谁来发展自然科学呢？这一个任务当然落在自然科学工作者的肩上。我们科学工作者也都感觉到有责任、有决心接受这一个光荣的任务。可是我们得想一想，怎样才有资格接受这一光荣的任务。判定这种资格的第一个条件，也是最基本的条件，就是我们每个人要有真正为人民服务的坚决意志，——为人民目前迫切的需要服务，必须摆在第一位；任凭自己个人的猜测而假定某项工作，就长期打算起来，即使是为人民的利益服务的，也只应摆在第二位。这一个条件要是加以反面的补充说明，便更见得清楚。就是说：我们必须反对为个人服务，为自己的利益或兴趣服务。
    第二个条件：就是要我们科学工作者大家都具有能够为人民服务的力量底信心。但是我不敢说：每一个科学工作者，都有信心能够完成他所担负的任务。为什么可以这样说呢？因为这里包藏着两个暧昧的因素：第一个因素就是我们每一个科学工作者是否全都相信他具有充分的技术上的能力来完成他所负担的任务；第二个因素，就是我们每一个科学工作者是否能够说：他已经很明确地、很彻底地、很愉快地认识了他必须争取加入人民革命底队伍，贡献他所有的力量，建设祖国，他的工作才有意义。这就联系到科学工作者本身的思想问题。
    因为这一重大的理由，现在全国教育和科学工作者，必然都能体会：为什么毛主席在这第三次全国委员会很隆重的开会词中特别指出：“思想改造，首先是各种知识分子的思想改造，是我国在各方面彻底实现民主改革和逐步实行工业化的重要条件之一”；为什么周总理在百忙之中，花费了五小时的功夫，用那样诚恳的态度，向我们北京、天津各高等学校的同人解释：知识分子的思想改造是如何重要；为什么郭沫若同志、胡乔木同志、李富春同志、宋劭文同志在最近中国科学院院务会议上都做了很重要的报告。在这些报告中，有的很清楚地针对着思想问题，有的看起来是着重技术问题，但实质上仍然牵涉到思想问题。
    毛主席的指示，周总理以及其他各位同志的号召，已经在急于求进的科学界、教育界中广泛地启发了对思想改造的认识；促成了目前在科学界和教育界中热烈展开的批评与自我批评运动。
    这样，很清楚，现在的问题，不是从旧社会出来的科学家们——当然连我自己在内——的思想要不要改造，而是要怎样改造。这就提供了一大堆的复杂问题。不到把每一个问题追根到底，而加以解决的时候，恐怕没有人能保证他的思想上不存在着一些或大或小的问题。思想改造是一个艰苦的工作，细致的工作，不能性急的工作，但也是刻不容缓的工作。当一个病人，他的血液中含着病菌的时候，要想把病治好，不是洗一个澡就可以了事的；是要用尽一切方法，有时不是不痛苦的方法，来使血液、细胞健强起来，才能消灭病菌，恢复健康。
    在这个很短的时间，据我个人有限的了解，我不能，也不敢提出那许许多多的思想上的问题，不过从我个人的经验上看来，似乎有几个比较扼要的问题，在此值得提出：
    我们中国的科学工作者，直到现在，极大多数是直接或间接从西欧和美国以及日本各资本主义国家的科学界脱身出来的。因此，在思想意识上难免不打上了两层烙印：一、是在外国所打上的，那便是资本主义社会里，名为科学的而实际是反科学的思想烙印。二、是在中国旧社会所打上的，那便是半封建、半殖民地的思想烙印。
    第一项的思想烙印，主要就是现时资本主义社会里科学思想的特征。那些特征，包括以下几个要点：
    （一）是科学超政治的错误观念。从这种错误观念出发，就很容易使科学工作者脱离现实，着重于学院式的研究，或者强调纯技术性的观点，从而使一般人民，连科学工作者本身在内，误认科学的研究只是单纯地解决某一些技术问题；而科学工作者并不需要过问为什么要解决那些问题，也不需要过问他们研究的成果如何应用。这样，一些科学研究的成果就很方便地为反动统治集团所利用。
    （二）从上面所说的错误观点出发，反动统治者和资本家们便很方便地利用所谓学术自由的口号来笼络科学工作者，为他们的利益服务。而科学工作者本身也正好借这种自欺欺人的口号来提高他们在资本主义社会的地位，有时候还想借此来减少良心上的苛责。
    （三）因为资本主义本身的混乱，便造成科学研究工作缺乏计划，酿成混乱的现象。对于这种漫无计划的现象，资本主义的科学家往往提出一种他们认为能够自圆其说的说法，他们就这样说：科学研究好像是在黑暗中找东西一样，因为不知道有什么东西可找，才需要临机应变地，想种种办法去找那些还不知道是什么的东西；假如已经知道了，什么东西在什么地方，那就不用去找，就是说不用去研究了，也就是说科学研究不能受预定计划的限制。这种似是而非的论调是一种遁词，是不切实际的。实际上，科学的拟论或理论就表示了科学本身的计划性。
    有这样一种情况值得注意：计划越精密、越严格、实施计划的效能越大。但是事实上，依据过去所得的资料，对着不容易预先捉摸的研究目标的特征来做研究的计划，多少不得不要它具有相当弹性。然而弹性和严格性显然是矛盾的，怎样克服这种矛盾，便是科学工作计划和科学工作本身继续发展所不可避免的途径。
    （四）由于机械唯物主义的流行，使得许多由资本主义社会出身的科学家倾向于保守，而找不着前进的道路。
    （五）由于主观和相对唯心主义的流行，使许多由资本主义社会出身的科学家们倾向于悲观主义和神秘主义。
    包括在第二项内的思想烙印，有这几点：
    （一）由于过去半殖民地思想底影响，我们中国的科学工作者往往缺乏自信心和自尊心。他们总不免有一种倾向去求得外国人的赏识，而不努力在国内发扬科学研究自立的精神。
    （二）由于上述的原因，中国的科学界中有价值的著作多在外国发表，或者在国内用外国文字发表；中国人反而得不到好处。
    （三）由于残余的封建思想和半殖民地思想底影响，造成宗派主义，破坏团结。
    （四）由于过去在反动统治下，科学工作只是粉饰门面，与生产脱离关系，造成了不务实际的恶劣作风。
    上述两层思想上的障碍，有时是互相穿插、互为恶化的。它们可以种种色色的形式、意想不到的变相，在我们的思想上出现。
    这些冥顽的、反动的、混乱的思想意识以及和这些关联的思想意识底粗鲁形态。这两年来，由于人民巩固了自己的政权和由于人民民主专政政权的迅速发展，在社会意识上已经不存在了，解放了的中国人民的怒火把它们都摧毁了。可是我们得要记着：野马游尘，不是不会集合成肮脏；死火余烬，不是没有复燃的可能性，尤其当人们认识了自然科学不属于上层建筑，而容易忘却了颓败的上层建筑，却时时在严重地威胁着自然科学底发展的时候，我们得小心一点，怕的是图书室或实验室里的一个阴暗的角落，隐藏着武训的游魂。
    唯有从家庭到学校，从工矿场到田野，更广泛地、更深入地、更热烈地展开爱国运动，才能彻底地扫除尘垢，肃清封建、买办余孽的阴影，奠定我们尊严的民族形式底基础。唯有打倒经验主义，一切唯心主义、机械唯物主义和知识极限论等等胡说，以及教条主义；唯有从认真地学习毛泽东思想，特别顽强地学习实践论，从而在我们的工作和日常生活中体验马克思、列宁主义的效用，才能彻底解放并且整秩我们的思想，才能巩固我们的思想战线。
    同志们！请看在朝鲜战场上我们祖国的优秀儿女那种可歌可泣，英勇无比的表现；几百万农民，浩浩荡荡的队伍，组织起来，在一年以内，竟完成了治淮的初步工程，以及其他在全国各种伟大的成就。我不相信我犯了错误，假如我说：这些伟大的成就，全是我们思想战线上初步胜利的果实。
    在这样巩固起来了的思想战线上，只要我们展开更坚韧的战斗，无疑地，我们很快就要获得更伟大的胜利。光辉灿烂的前途，不是我们今天所容易想像到的。
    用马克思、列宁主义武装起来了的世界人民胜利万岁！
    用毛泽东思想武装起来了的中国人民胜利万岁！
    我们思想的导师毛主席万岁！
　　内蒙古自治区人民政府主席乌兰夫发言
    内蒙古自治区人民继续支援人民志愿军主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    在这次人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议上，听了毛主席的开会词，和周总理的政治报告，以及关于抗美援朝工作、财政经济工作、文化教育工作等报告。我完全同意和拥护。尤其是毛主席所提出的继续加强抗美援朝工作、增加生产、厉行节约、支援中国人民志愿军的中心任务，这是非常切合中国当前斗争形势，符合全国人民的意志。内蒙古自治区各民族人民坚决与全国人民团结一致，为实现这一中心任务，为争取抗美援朝早日胜利而奋斗。
    美国帝国主义者发动侵略朝鲜战争之目的，是妄图通过战争把整个朝鲜变成它的殖民地，并进而侵略我国。保卫我们的国家，坚决反对美帝国主义侵略与支援朝鲜人民，成为我国各民族人民神圣的责任。
    因此，内蒙古自治区人民，自从美国发动侵略朝鲜战争之后，就密切地关心着朝鲜战争的形势和我们国家的安全，并立即响应了中国人民抗美援朝总会的号召，展开抗美援朝爱国运动。
    一年来，内蒙古自治区各民族人民，在抗美援朝运动中表现了无限的积极性，广大群众用各种实际行动表示：对毛主席、中国共产党、中央人民政府无限爱戴和拥护；对于伟大祖国衷心热爱；对朝鲜前线的支援，对建设与巩固我们的伟大祖国，尽了应有的努力。我们曾进行过一次大规模的慰问中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军救济朝鲜难民的捐献运动，共捐献现金十三亿元，粮食一百七十多万斤与大批慰问袋和慰问信。
    在自治区各城镇、林区、农村、草地举行了控诉日寇、美帝国主义、蒋匪暴行的各种集会，举行了保卫和平反对美国重新武装日本的各种集会。据不完全统计：内蒙古各界人民参加拥护五大国缔结和平公约与反对美国重新武装日本的签名和投票的人数达一百七十四万四千五百九十五人，占内蒙古自治区总人口的百分之七十二点七。在“五一”国际劳动节，城乡人民参加示威游行的人数有一百三十五万人，占内蒙古自治区总人口百分之五十六点二五。各界人民群众经过这些运动，已普遍地受到一定程度的抗美援朝爱国主义教育，加深了仇视、蔑视美帝国主义，大大提高了抗美援朝保家卫国的决心和胜利信心。
    现在，内蒙古各地人民通过增加生产，增加收入已捐献了十四架飞机、三门大炮、和一万二千一百只黄羊，以支援朝鲜前线。各地人民并按照不同的职业，不同的生产和工作性质，分别按照机关、学校、村屯各种生产和工作单位，各种行业订立了爱国公约并进行了一次到两次的检查和修订。对贫苦缺乏劳力的烈、军属的耕地普遍实行了代耕，保证烈、军属耕地的收获不低于代耕者本人同样土地的收获，并普遍进行了一次优待烈、军属工作的检查。优待烈、军属，尊敬烈、军属已成为社会风气。经过这些工作，抗美援朝爱国运动，已日益深入开展，不仅在工人、农民、牧民、青年、妇女中深入开展，在工商界中也都订立爱国公约，积极缴纳税款和积极改善经营，增加收入，捐献飞机大炮。在内蒙喇嘛教中也举行了抗美援朝代表会议，订立喇嘛爱国公约，举行各种爱国活动。
    抗美援朝爱国主义运动有力地推动了生产和各方面的工作。农民、牧民展开了爱国丰产增畜运动，广大农民在人民政府提倡的组织起来、精耕细作、提高生产技术的方针下，积极地展开爱国丰产竞赛运动，并积极进行了向灾害作斗争。牧民在人民政府保护牧场、自由放牧、保畜增畜的方针下，发展畜牧业的积极性分外提高，今年牧区各种牲畜的繁殖率平均占母畜的百分之七十，仔畜成活率达百分之九十以上，各种牲畜的纯增殖率，已超过了增殖百分之十一的原定计划。各工厂各林区工人在爱国主义生产竞赛运动中生产效率显著提高。而大张旗鼓地镇压反革命运动的结果，暗藏的反革命残余已遭到严重打击，土匪已完全肃清，群众的阶级觉悟大为提高，人民民主专政的政权、抗美援朝的后方大为巩固。
    我们今后的工作是：继续加强抗美援朝工作，一时一刻不能松懈自己的战斗意志，用一切力量支援中国人民志愿军，争取抗美援朝最后胜利的早日到来。坚决拥护中央人民政府各种政策和一切措施，努力增加生产，厉行节约，完成各种支援前线和各种生产建设任务。普遍检查和修订爱国公约。做好优待烈、军属工作，农村里做好代耕工作，保证其土地生产量和生活水平不低于一般群众；城市做好介绍职业，组织生产工作。
    内蒙古自治区今年有很大的地区遭受到严重的旱、风、霜等灾害，生产救灾已成当前中心任务。我们要坚决贯彻生产自救的方针，发动群众大力进行各种副业生产，展开物资交流与组织群众性的社会互助互济运动。做到生产救灾增加收入十二万吨粮的任务。我们要组织灾区人民用抗美援朝爱国主义的热情，积极生产，克服困难，以减少国家的负担，增加抗美援朝力量。
    我们虽有很大地区遭受严重灾荒，但人民群众爱国捐献的热情并没有因此减低，在生产自救的基础上，努力缴纳捐款，我们可以保证完成捐献工作，并争取超过，以支援朝鲜前线。
    为了增加生产，我们现在即着手准备防止明年春旱与克服由于今年的灾害所给农业上的损失，进行恢复与发展农业生产的准备工作。对工业、林业、牧畜业及其他各种经济事业，在几年已有的基础上要更加进一步向前发展。最近即准备在全区开展一个精简节约反对铺张、反对贪污浪费运动，使国家的财政做到最大限度的节省与避免任何的浪费，以增加抗美援朝和国家建设的力量。
    内蒙古人民在毛主席、中国共产党和中央人民政府领导下得到解放并实行了民族区域自治，发展了民族经济文化，在中华人民共和国民族友爱合作的大家庭里充分享受了民族平等的权利，因而各民族间的平等、团结、友爱、互助的关系日益巩固和发展。热爱祖国的觉悟大为提高。内蒙古自治区人民坚决拥护中央人民政府的各种政策和措施，响应国家的一切号召，努力增加生产，为建设和巩固我各民族人民的伟大祖国的事业，为支援抗美援朝前线，为抗美援朝伟大斗争的最后胜利而贡献一切力量。一年来我们的工作有不少缺点和错误，但我们相信在毛主席和中央人民政府正确的领导下，我们在一九五二年的工作一定比今年作的好。最后我高呼：
    中国人民志愿军万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
　　湖南大学校长李达发言
    学习毛泽东选集是教育工作者重要任务毛主席、各位副主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    本届会议的中心议题是抗美援朝，节约增产，此外还有一个重要议题是“学习毛泽东选集，改造思想”，因此我特就这个题目发言一次，请各位指教。
    毛主席早在一九三七年所著“实践论”之中说过：“无产阶级和革命人民改造世界的斗争，包括实现下述的任务：改造客观世界，也改造自己的主观世界——改造自己的认识能力，改造主观世界同客观世界的关系。”这所谓“改造主观世界——改造自己的认识能力”，就是改造思想，改造思想方法与工作方法。他还预言中国人民即将通过这样的改造过程。
    随着中国人民革命的伟大胜利，毛主席在一九四九年七月一日所发表的“论人民民主专政”中，即曾提起：“人民的国家是保护人民的。有了人民的国家，人民才有可能，在全国范围内和全体规模上，用民主的方法，教育自己和改造自己，使自己脱离内外反动派的影响（这个影响现在还是很大的，并将在长时期内存在着，不能很快地消灭），改造自己从旧社会得来的坏习惯和坏思想，不使自己走入反动派指引的错误路上去，并继续前进，向着社会主义社会与共产主义社会发展。”因为胜利了的中国人民革命，是翻天覆地的、史无前例的大变化，新国家的建设，无论在政治上、经济上、文化教育上，一切都要遵照马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，实行根本的改造，这在过去受了资产阶级思想薰陶的人们看来，一切都感到突然，感到要重新学习。果然，新国家成立以来，全国人民都在用民主的方法改造自己和教育自己，都学习社会发展史，学习新民主主义论，学习政治经济学，学习政策，学习时事。两年来全国人民的思想改造，都有了显著的进步，特别是从去年以来，经过了抗美援朝、土地改革和镇压反革命的三大运动，全国人民的政治水平确实大大地提高了。所以毛主席在本届会议开会词中说：“在我国的文化教育战线和各种知识分子中，根据中央人民政府的方针，广泛地开展了一个自我教育和自我改造的运动，这同样是我国值得祝贺的新气象。”接着他指示我们：“思想改造，首先是各种知识分子的思想改造，是我国在各方面彻底实现民主改革和逐步实行工业化的重要条件之一。因此，我们预祝这个自我教育和自我改造运动能够在稳步前进中获得更大的成就。”毛主席这一指示，是庄严的，伟大的，正确的，我们必须接受这个指示，继续加强这个思想改造运动。
    全国人民的自我教育和自我改造运动的发展是不平衡的。一般地说来，工人阶级的思想改造，最积极，最进步，因为他们最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。他们努力发展生产，发挥了创造性，现已能够创造出各种工作母机，创造出汽车及其他各种机械，出现了很多劳动模范，便是一个证明。其次，农民的思想改造，也比较进步得快，他们在生产上的努力，成绩显著，出现了很多农业劳动模范，也是一个证明。原来抱着小资产阶级和资产阶级的思想的知识分子、教育工作者、学术工作者们，在中华人民共和国成立以后两年中，思想上也有了很大的变化，但是我们应当承认，这个进步还不能满足国家和人民的需要，我们必须更进一步，加强学习。
    为了得到更大的进步，彻底改造全国文化教育工作者的思想，我们一定要响应周总理在政治报告中的号召：“用马克思列宁主义与中国革命的实践相结合的毛泽东思想武装起来！这就是中国人民民主统一战线的新任务。”他说：“全国委员会开会之际，正值毛泽东选集第一卷出版，我们要担负起推动各方面组织学习毛泽东选集的责任。”
    刘少奇副主席说：“毛泽东思想，就是马克思列宁主义的理论与中国革命的实践之统一的思想，就是中国的共产主义，中国的马克思主义。”他又说：“毛泽东思想，就是马克思主义在目前时代的殖民地、半殖民地、半封建国家民族民主革命中之继续发展，就是马克思主义民族化的优秀典型。”毛泽东思想，是指导中国的革命建国的百战百胜的理论，这是中国人民革命的胜利和新国家建设的成就所完全证明了的。由于有了伟大的毛泽东思想，中华民族变成了有科学的革命建国理论的民族了，这是中华民族的光荣，是中国人民的骄傲。
    现在，毛泽东选集出版了。这是中国人民与世界人民思想政治生活中的重大事件，是全世界马克思列宁主义事业中的重大事件，我们要为这一伟大的政治事件而欢呼！而庆贺！
    毛泽东思想，通过毛泽东选集，呈现在我们人民面前了。世界各国人民，都将翻译毛泽东选集作为学习马列主义的教科书；我中国人民更要加倍努力，把毛泽东选集作为学习马列主义、毛泽东思想的教科书，这是天经地义的事情。
    至于学习毛泽东选集的方法，我想简单地贡献一点浅见。
    毛主席曾经指示我们：我们学习马克思列宁主义，是在于“学会应用马克思列宁主义的立场、观点和思想方法，认真的研究中国的历史，研究中国的经济、政治、军事、文化，对每一问题加以调查研究，然后创造出理论。”现在，我们学习毛泽东思想，也必须遵照这个指示，学会毛泽东思想的立场、观点与方法，来解决革命与建设中各种实际问题。若果不是这样，而单只熟读、背诵毛泽东选集中的各篇文章，而不能精通它，应用它，我们用百分数来计算成绩，那是一分也没有的。
    毛泽东思想的立场是无产阶级的立场，其观点是唯物论的观点，其方法是辩证法的方法。这样的立场、观点与方法，像一根红线一样，贯串于毛主席的一切著作之中。为要学会毛泽东思想的立场、观点与方法，我主张先学习“实践论”。“实践论”是马克思列宁主义的、辩证唯物论的认识论，是毛主席的思想方法与工作方法的科学总结，是中国人民革命经验的科学总结。我们若果学懂了“实践论”，就得到了理解毛主席一切著作的关键，然后从头学习毛主席在第一和第二两次国内革命战争时期的著作，学习毛主席怎样应用马克思列宁主义的立场、观点与方法，解决中国革命中各种特殊的具体的问题，这对于我们的学习是大有帮助的。
    其次，我们要把握住毛泽东选集中所解决的几个最重要的中心问题，例如：关于中国革命与世界革命的关系，关于中国革命的总路线，关于新民主主义的理论与政策，关于工人阶级领导革命的理论与政策，关于农民解放的理论与政策，关于革命统一战线的理论与政策，关于革命战争的理论与政策，关于经济、文化、教育的理论与政策，关于党的建设的理论与方法——这一切都是毛主席应用马克思列宁主义解决中国革命建国问题的具体表现，都是马克思列宁主义在中国革命中的具体应用与扩张。我们必须环绕这些中心问题，去学习毛泽东选集。
    为了彻底了解毛泽东选集各篇著作的意义，并且使学习收到应有的成效，在学习的时候，我们必须结合党史、结合中国革命史去学习，学习毛主席在何种客观的革命形势中去解决所遭遇的困难问题。其次，我们应当联系自己的思想，联系自己本岗位的工作去学习，联系国家的经济、财政、文化、教育各方面的政策和各种建设情况去学习。
    同志们！我们一定要遵照毛主席的指示，加强思想改造，作为“在各方面彻底实现民主改革和逐步实行工业化的重要条件。”各机关各工厂固然要实现民主改革，就是各学校也要实现民主改革，即彻底改造旧教育，实行新教育，用革命精神和革命方法，改进教学内容与教学方法，大量地速成地培养出各种建设人才，创造出工业化的条件。为要做到这一层，教育工作者，必须加紧学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，改造自己的思想。因此，我们要响应周总理的号召，努力学习毛泽东选集，用毛泽东思想把自己的头脑武装起来。
    马克思说过：“教育者必须受教育。”我们教育工作者，必须深刻地认识到：理论必须结合于实际，科学必须服务于建设，教学必须服从于政治。所以我们必须学习毛泽东选集，改造自己的思想，然后才能站在青年们的前面，领导他们。现在青年们的进步是很快的，我们自己若不努力改造思想，青年们定会跑到我们前面去，我们便落伍了。
    同志们！中华人民共和国好比是一只大船，全中国人民都已上到这只大船上，毛主席是这只大船的舵手，他领导我们乘长风破万里浪，驶向共产主义的彼岸。我们在这船上的人民，固然要服从舵手的指示，搞好本岗位的工作，同时又得要知道这航行的方向，发挥出积极性和创造性，为早日渡到美丽的彼岸而努力。所以学习毛泽东选集，改造我们的思想，是中国人民民主统一战线的新任务！
　　松江省协商委员会副主席杜光预发言
    松江省人民决继续努力支援我国志愿军主席、副主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我这次能够列席中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议，非常荣幸，听到了毛主席的开会词和中央各位首长的报告，我完全同意。并愿为完成这次会议的中心任务而奋斗。
    我们松江省过去一年来在抗美援朝伟大斗争中由于毛主席及中央人民政府的英明领导，各项工作也获得了一些成绩。松江省人民代表会议协商委员会团结了各民族和各民主阶层，动员了各民族和各阶层人民的力量，大力的支援了前方。在爱国主义政治教育下，人民的觉悟大大地提高了。很多地方可以听到：“为了抗美援朝，保家卫国，要人有人，要粮有粮，要钱有钱”的呼声。一年来，松江省志愿参军的和志愿参加担架队的人数是很大的。其中有一批担架队员共二万四千人，在前线立功得奖的就达百分之三十。我省并供应了大批大车、汽车、马匹，并有大批司机、技工、医生、学生、武工队干部等志愿去前方服务。在响应抗美援朝总会的号召捐献武器运动方面，也表现出人民的爱国热情，松江省现已认捐五十一架战斗机，二门高射炮，交款已超过百分之八十，并保证于十一月初全部交齐。关于订立爱国公约的运动也已热烈展开，据不完整之统计，松江全省现已有八万多个基层单位的爱国公约。从它所起的增加生产提高工作效率加强学习的作用来看，不可否认的是有重大意义的。
    松江省农民在抗美援朝爱国主义教育下，展开了爱国主义丰产运动，今年虽有部分地区遭受水灾，但仍可保持八成年景的丰收。今年的农业生产总值将为去年的百分之一○三点七，单位面积产量每垧地已由二七九八斤提高到二八二六斤。因之农村中已出现了下列的新面貌：（一）中农生活水平以上的人口，已占全省农村人口的百分之七十左右；
    （二）全省所种植商品粮和工业原料品占全省耕地面积的百分之五十，农村商品经济有显著的发展；（三）农业互助组已有十五万多个，参加互助组的农民占全体农民的百分之九十，其中使用苏联马拉农具的有五十四个组，使用新式改良农具的有一万二千多个组，推广优良品种的占整个互助组的百分之五十，互助组中的农业副业相结合，分工分业的大型组，占百分之二十以上，农业互助组的进一步巩固和提高，已有了一定有利基础；（四）农民的副业生产收入，大大增加，我省农民仅在今年冬季生产中，即可收入四千一百多亿元，相当于我省农业生产总值的百分之二十，已超过全年的公粮负担数目，如以全年副业收入计算，将二倍此数，那就是说，农民全年副业生产总值可相当于农业生产总值的百分之四十左右，这些农村的新面貌就更加鼓舞了农民积极扩大再生产的要求，农业生产还须要大踏步向前发展，还须要努力提高农业技术以提高单位面积产量。这已是农民的普遍要求。
    地方工业生产在爱国主义竞赛运动下也有了发展，省直营工业一九五一年的生产总值超过了一九五○年的生产总值的百分之五十，一般产品质量，经过质量大检查也有所改进，下半年开展了增产节约发挥潜在能力的运动，在原订计划基础上，松江省可增产节约二十四万五千吨粮食的价值。私营工业在国营经济领导下，也进一步发展了，以哈尔滨市为例，今年上半年的生产总值为去年同期的百分之一百三十，其中经过国家加工订货的占其总值的百分之六十四点五，虽然如此，工业产品尚不能满足城乡人民购买力的需要，因此，继续发动爱国主义的工业增产运动，必须蓬勃地开展起来，而且一定会蓬勃地开展起来的。
    随着工农业生产的发展，国营商业与合作社及私营商业也有显著发展，单就合作社说：合作社社员今年比去年增加百分之二十五，资金增加百分之二十，社员占总人口的百分之五十左右，农村社员占农村人口的百分之六十。为了进一步活跃城乡物资交流，必须增强国营贸易的领导作用，并进一步发展合作社。
    随着工农业生产的发展，人民生活也日渐改善了，一九五一年我省社会购买力较去年约提高百分之五十点六四，而明年全省社会购买力较今年还可提高百分之三十九，这就可以清楚的看到抗美援朝不但不像帝国主义者所妄想的那样，使我们在经济上不能恢复和发展，反而成为促使经济迅速发展的动力，这也就更加证明了新民主主义社会制度的优越性。
    毛主席指示我们：“为了继续坚持这个必要的正义的斗争，我们就需要继续加强抗美援朝的工作，需要增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军。这是中国人民今天的中心任务。”这是完全正确的，这是全国人民的伟大心愿。也是我们松江省人民的伟大心愿，我认为这次会议，在毛主席亲自领导下，获得了完全的成功，它必然会鼓舞和动员全国人民争取抗美援朝的胜利，必然在人民民主的各种建设事业上，获得更大的成功。我谨代表松江省协商委员会向中国人民伟大领袖毛主席致敬！
　　工商界代表陈经畬发言
    在国营经济领导下为经济建设服务主席、各位委员、各位先生：
    我代表工商界首先向领导我们全国人民走向胜利的毛主席和中国共产党，致最崇高的敬意和衷心的感谢。
    我们一致拥护毛主席在开会词中所昭示我们的：继续加强抗美援朝，增加生产，厉行节约，支持中国人民志愿军为今后我们中心任务的伟大号召，并愿为响应这个伟大的号召和完成这个神圣的任务而努力。
    我们完全同意周总理所指出的：十六个月以来，伟大祖国的人民事业，在土地改革、抗美援朝、镇压反革命三大运动中，所获得的各方面的新的胜利，以及指示我们今后应该努力的方向。我们听了陈叔通副主席关于中国人民政协全国委员会常务委员会的工作报告，和彭真副主席关于抗美援朝保家卫国运动的报告，使我们进一步认识中国人民的伟大力量，是不能战胜的，美帝国主义的侵略行为，必然被我们爱好和平的中国人民所击败。在这里，我们特别要向中国人民志愿军致敬，因为由于他们在前线的辉煌胜利，才保障了我们后方人民的安居乐业。我们听了陈云副总理关于经济工作和财政工作的报告，感到无比的兴奋。陈副总理的报告充分说明了我们一年多来在财经战线上的伟大胜利和潜在的深厚的生产能力。我们又听到了郭沫若副总理关于文化教育工作的报告，使我们明了经过了这一年多的努力，已经普遍地提高了全国人民的政治觉悟和文化水平，并为祖国的进步发展，培养了干部人材。
    以上这一切的辉煌成就证明了毛泽东思想在中国人民事业的实践中伟大的胜利，证明了中国共产党领导的正确，也证明了人民民主专政制度的优越性。
    解放后的中国工商业，由于以毛主席为首的中国共产党和中央人民政府领导的正确，基本上已经摆脱了帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义所造成的严重困难，经过了一年来人民政府大力调整工商业，使我们的业务由恢复走向发展；我们工商业者，也在毛泽东思想的指导与各界人民的帮助之下，努力学习，积极改造，在政治认识上已有显著的进步，在业务经营上也有各种不同程度的改变；但是进步是不平衡的，不管在工商业的好转方面，工商业者的政治认识提高方面，工商联的组织团结方面，都表现出不平衡的现象。今后我们一定要遵照周总理的指示，首先在原有的基础上，进一步加强我们工商业者本身的团结，尤其要使工商联真正成为代表全体工商界的包括中小工商业者的健全组织。使各城市、各阶层、各行业的工商业者都能广阔坚强的团结起来，在国营经济的领导下，为完成新民主主义的经济建设而努力。第二，要更肯定地接受国营经济的领导，更明确地树立依靠工人阶级的思想，使我们企业的发展，避免盲目竞争，使我们企业的经营，发挥更大的力量。第三，我们虽然已经广泛地展开了学习，但是显得没有系统，不够深入。周总理指示我们要学习毛泽东思想，以毛泽东选集为学习的主要内容。我们回到各地之后，一定要好好地动员并组织工商业者，有系统地有计划地来学习毛泽东选集，使广大的工商业者，提高理论认识，将残留在我们思想上的旧民主主义的意识，彻底肃清，将毛泽东思想，贯彻到实际行动中去，使我们改造自己的努力，得到更大的成功。
    最后我们一致保证，将这次会议关于抗美援朝工作的决议，带回到广大的工商业者中去，展开宣传教育，使每一个工商业者彻底认识决议的基本精神，发挥比现在还要高涨的爱国主义和国际主义的热情，使抗美援朝工作的执行，收到比以前更大的效果。我们要做到，通过抗美援朝运动，依靠工人阶级的智慧，发掘蕴藏着的强大的生产力，节约一切应该节约的物力财力，使我们伟大的祖国，在抗美援朝的斗争中，迅速富强壮大起来，为保卫祖国的安全，保卫远东和世界的和平而斗争。
    让我们再一次感谢毛主席和中国共产党、中央人民政府的正确领导，使一百年来受尽帝国主义的压迫、受尽封建主义官僚资本主义剥削的民族工商业者，能够转变为广大人民提高生活水平而服务，只有在毛泽东时代，我们民族工商业才能获得如此光辉的前途。最后让我们高呼：
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
　　社会民主人士周震鳞发言
　　为伟大祖国的光辉成就而欢呼主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    这次我列席人民政协全国委员会的盛会，感到万分的荣幸和兴奋。在会议上我们已听到了毛主席的开会词，周总理的政治报告，以及各首长的重要报告，我衷诚拥护毛主席的英明指示，完全同意大会的各项报告，这使我更进一步的认识到中华人民共和国开国两年来，特别是一年来的抗美援朝、土地改革与镇压反革命三大运动中，由于毛主席与中国共产党英明的领导，中国人民已经在各个战线上取得了辉煌的胜利。中国人民已经空前地团结起来了，人民民主专政业已巩固起来了，中华人民共和国是今日世界和平民主阵营中的强国，是东方保卫和平事业的有力支柱。今天中国人民志愿军能够在朝鲜战场上和朝鲜人民军一道，有力地抗击着美帝国主义的疯狂侵略，能取得伟大的胜利，这是必然的结果，在此，我要为伟大祖国的光辉成就而欢呼！
    我来自湖南，就将湖南的情况说一说：湖南解放两年来，随着全国胜利形势的发展，各方面的工作同样也取得了巨大的成绩：现在全省公开活动的土匪特务武装已经肃清了；经过镇压反革命运动以后，湖南的社会秩序也完全安定了；土地改革在全省大部分地区已经完成，剩下一小部分地区即将在今冬和明春全部完成；抗美援朝运动正在继续深入和扩大；爱国公约已逐渐普遍订立，并进行检查与贯彻执行；增产捐献武器运动目前已完成缴款一千亿元以上，今年冬天即将完成并超过认捐一百零三架战斗机的号召；在抗美援朝爱国主义热情的鼓舞下，广大的工人，农民，开展了爱国增产运动，使今年稻谷生产比去年增产十五亿斤，约增产百分之十一，明年将可能达到和超过战前生产水平；地方工业也在迅速的恢复和发展；其他文化教育事业等都有着新的进步；同时各革命阶级，各民主党派与广大的社会人士的觉悟也提高了，团结也加强了。湖南是毛主席的革命故乡，湖南是具有光荣革命传统的湖南人民正满怀胜利的信心，为建设新湖南，为保卫祖国与世界和平事业而继续的前进。
    以上仅是我个人所看到的和所知道的事实，这就足以说明人民民主专政制度的优越性，回忆我早年随孙中山先生从事国民革命，数十年来，目的也在求中国的繁荣富强，但一竟没有成功，而中途被蒋介石等反动集团所破坏。今天，中国人民革命的伟大胜利，不但转变了中国历史的方向，更转变了亚洲历史的方向，这的确是毛主席领导中国人民进行新民主主义革命的胜利，也就是毛泽东思想的胜利。看到今天全国的胜利，想起过去的失败，无限感奋。我今年虽是七十七了，却始终站在反对帝国主义，反对蒋介石匪帮的一面。我愿意和大家一道，为人民事业而献出我的一分力量。同时，我极端热忱的希望各民主党派，各民主人士，各少数民族和全国人民更加紧密地团结在毛泽东的旗帜下，继续加强抗美援朝的工作，增加生产，厉行节约，积极支持中国人民志愿军，为争取抗美援朝的最后胜利，为建设祖国，为保卫世界和平而奋斗！
    最后，我以极兴奋的情绪谨祝大会胜利成功！
    中国人民大团结万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
　　青年工作者代表李昌发言
　　努力学习马列主义和毛泽东思想主席、各位委员、各位代表：
    听了毛主席的开会词，周总理的政治报告和陈叔通、彭真、陈云及郭沫若等同志的报告，我们非常感奋。一年来我们国家在抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大运动以及其他各个战线上的成就是伟大的。它使我们深深体验到生活在毛泽东时代的中国青年是幸福的。我们要百倍努力地来迎接当前的任务，不辜负祖国的培养和人民的期望。
    在这里，我谨代表全国青年向毛主席、中国共产党和中央人民政府致以崇高的敬礼和衷心的感谢，并向中国人民志愿军致以战斗的敬礼和亲切的慰问。
    中国青年一代，在以毛主席为首的中国共产党和中央人民政府的英明领导和殷切关怀下，在爱国主义和国际主义精神教育下，不断地提高着自己的思想、政治水平、文化、科学技术知识，并有着一切可能发挥自己的劳力、勇敢和智慧，在各个战线上为祖国建立功勋。
    正因为这样，一年来，全国青年在中国共产党的领导下，空前广泛地动员了起来，在保卫和建设祖国的事业中发挥了巨大的积极作用。正因为这样，青年们曾提出和执行着这样的口号：祖国需要的地方就是我们的岗位，例如：在动员参加中国人民志愿军和各种军事干部学校时，青年自动报名的人数总是超过预定的招生名额；农村青年绝大多数积极地参加了土地改革斗争，土地改革后又积极参加民主建政。据中南区统计，在农村的基层干部中，青年约占三分之一；在东北，青年工人参加爱国主义生产竞赛者达百分之九十二；在铁路方面，一九五一年受到行政各种方式的奖励的青年团员达三万五千八百四十三人，占全路团员百分之六十九点四；在规模巨大的治淮工程中，青年占民工总数的百分之四十；学生们在思想政治学习和肃清帝国主义封建主义思想方面有很大的进步，本年度高等学校毕业生自觉地服从国家需要，接受了政府的统一分配工作。
    在爱国主义旗帜下，一年来，青年中涌现了许多新的英雄和模范：如在朝鲜前线上，机智勇敢地阻击敌人，获得“青年英雄”称号的十九岁青年团员曾南生；英勇作战，在危急情况下，挺身而出，指挥作战，坚守阵地十小时，打垮敌人八次进攻，杀伤敌人近百名的“模范团员”曹殿英和他的五个战友；以四个手雷，一箱炸药，击毁敌坦克两辆，汽车四辆，荣记特功的张宝富；在敌机轰炸下，机智地安全行驶汽车四万六千里，获得朝鲜民主主义人民共和国军功奖章的王仁山；荣记大功的模范护理员女团员韩梅。在土地改革战线上，江西上饶某村民兵队长、团员李月飞因积极参加土地改革斗争，在恶霸地主进行反攻时，英勇不屈，并率领本村民兵进剿，俘获地主武装十四人，荣获了“江西民兵特等英雄”称号。在镇压反革命战线上，东北工人纠察队青工团员祝文秀深夜与潜入厂房纵火破坏的两名特务搏斗，打死了一名，另一名逃跑；为保卫工厂而光荣负伤的祝文秀得到“护厂功臣”的称号。天津胡承志等七个小英雄，英勇机智，巧捉特务。上海女学生卢成栩，不顾特务的暗中威胁，她宣布她的父亲大特务、国民党上饶集中营的一个首犯卢旭是她的敌人，站在人民女儿的立场严正地控诉了卢旭的种种罪恶。在生产战线上，创造新的细纱工作法的郝建秀；创造了日行一千一百一十三点八公里纪录的一○○八号机车乔玉岩青年包乘组；从去年到今年八月二十个月中，产品质量全部合规格，超额百分之五百三十三完成任务的旅大刘立富先进小组；创全国采煤纪录的山东贾汪煤矿李君停小组；治淮中的特等模范甘彩华、金秀兰，以及人民教师史瑞芬等等。他们和在座参加会议以及其他许多青年英雄模范，是祖国无数优秀青年儿女的代表者。还应该指出的，是东北生产节约运动中旅大刘钊小组。他们半年增产十二亿元的计划，三个月就完成了，他们在七、八两月中，提出的合理化建议采用了十五件，其中一件是利用小块焦和返焦，到年底即可为祖国增加财富四亿二千四百万元。这证明在劳动人民和青年中有着多么大的潜在力量。
    在过去的一年中，中国青年和苏联青年、各人民民主国家青年、亚洲各国青年及全世界民主青年的团结和友谊，有了更进一步的发展和巩固。国际青年团体和各国青年曾派九个代表团（共三十五个国家青年代表）到中国。我们曾派青年和少年队的代表、代表团出国十八次。特别是今年参加第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节的青年代表团和青年文工团，曾和一百零四个国家的青年欢聚。由于我国青年和各国青年的相互访问和接触，各国爱好和平的青年更深刻地认识了中国人民的伟大力量及其保卫和平的坚强决心。全世界爱好和平的青年都把中国革命的伟大胜利和新中国在各个战线上的巨大成就，看成自己的胜利和成就，他们热烈地支援着我们的伟大的抗美援朝保卫和平的正义的斗争。在柏林举行的第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节上，斯大林同志和毛泽东同志受到全世界爱好和平青年的最热烈的欢呼！
    现在抗美援朝的伟大斗争运动还在继续进行，为了继续坚持这个斗争，毛主席曾指出中国人民今天的中心任务是继续加强抗美援朝，增加生产，厉行节约。我们全国青年坚决响应这个号召，我们保证贯彻本次会议决议中所规定的各项具体工作。为此
    一、我们一定在青年中继续发展和深入抗美援朝的爱国主义教育，千百倍增强对美帝国主义及其在中国的一切特务间谍分子和一切侵略活动的仇恨和打击，准备好随时响应祖国的号召，支援朝鲜前线的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军。
    二、我们全国青年一定积极地参加爱国增产节约运动，并以此作为爱国公约的主要内容之一，每日每时，坚持贯彻。
    三、我们还要加强文化和技术科学的学习，以增加我们在保卫和建设祖国中的力量，同时我们要大力贯彻婚姻法，保障青年男女的切身利益，以发扬他们爱国增产、劳动发家的积极性。
    为了伟大的祖国，我们要努力做得更多、做得更好。我们深知：努力学习和掌握马列主义和毛泽东思想，乃是我们能够胜利地完成一切任务的关键。让我们全国青年和全国人民一起，在毛泽东的旗帜下胜利前进！
    我们伟大的祖国万岁！
    我们敬爱的领袖和导师毛主席万岁！
　　中南军政委员会副主席叶剑英发言
    三大运动已在华南地区获得巨大成绩主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我完全拥护毛主席开会词中的全部指示，拥护周总理的政治报告和其他各首长的报告。我们接受了大会所给予我们的任务，以后当团结全华南四千九百万人民，为坚决执行并完成这一任务而斗争，同时为我们伟大祖国一年来在抗美援朝所已获得的伟大胜利及财经、文教各个战线上的伟大成就而鼓舞和欢呼！
    关于中南行政区的工作，我们中南军政委员会副主席程颂云先生，已经向大会作了报告。我谨将华南工作情况作一个简单报告，作为程副主席报告的补充。
    华南地区一年多来，在毛主席、中央人民政府正确领导和中南军政委员会的直接指导之下，为着巩固两广人民政权，巩固华南国防，并动员恢复生产，曾经进行过一系列的工作。在这里，我们依据华南实际情况，在华南全境推行抗美援朝爱国运动和大张旗鼓镇压反革命工作；在农村以开展清匪反霸、减租退押的农民运动，来发动广大农民群众，训练干部，陆续地进入没收征收和分配土地；在广州及其他中等城市进行民主改革，消灭封建残余，建立合理的生产管理制度；在沿海发动渔民，反霸斗争，进行组织渔民工作。
    在抗美援朝爱国主义教育方面，已由城市推进到农村。我们利用各种机会，采用各种形式，大力清除群众中的亲美、崇美、恐美思想，建立仇视、鄙视、蔑视美帝国主义观念；从今天说来，已经大大地削弱了帝国主义对华南地区长期的毒害和影响，这表现在：华南二千五百万人民纷纷参加保卫世界和平的签名和反对美帝国主义重新武装日本的投票，并以实际行动和力量，支援了抗美援朝斗争；华南青年和学生报名参军、参加军事干部学校的，共达十万人以上；华南两省一市共捐献飞机一百七十五架，其中广东省捐献战斗机六十六架，正向一百架目标前进；广西省捐献五十三架；广州市捐献五十六架。工人农民开展爱国主义生产竞赛，工商业界展开集体完税、爱国捐献、革除陋规、改造工商业、促进城乡物资交流等工作。抗美援朝在华南已成为群众性的爱国主义伟大运动，成为推进各项实际工作的巨大动力。
    在土地改革方面：华南两省一市，约有九百万人口的地区，已经完成了土地改革。广州市郊区农村在胜利完成土地改革以后，已转入爱国增产运动；广东全省已有十三个县近五百万人口地区，在今年春天已经完成土地改革，现在正在占全省一半人口即一千五百万人口地区，依靠人民解放军，抽调大批干部，结合地方干部，开展清匪反霸退租退押运动，秋后即进入土地改革；广西省已在十个县完成土地改革，十个县部分进行土地改革。全省完成土地改革地区的人口共达四百二十余万人。今后，我们将继续放手发动群众，动员更多知识分子青年学生和工作干部参加土地改革，加强城市对农村的支援，扩大及巩固农村反封建统一战线，求得在一九五二年内全部完成华南的土地改革，以迎接全国计划性经济建设高潮。
    在镇压反革命方面，我们曾及时纠正了“宽大无边”偏向，执行毛主席所指示的镇压与宽大相结合的正确政策，大张旗鼓，发动群众，给反革命分子以严重打击，使民气大伸，敌焰大降，目前正加紧完成清理积案，开展劳动改造工作，并在已经土地改革的农村和镇压反革命运动已经开展的城市普遍建立群众自己的治安保卫组织，继续深入镇压反革命工作；在清匪方面，华南解放以来，先后剿灭了七十余万土匪，缴获各种枪枝近一百万枝，其中广东省剿灭了二十七万土匪，缴获五十万余枪枝；广西省剿灭了四十七万土匪，缴获四十四万枝枪枝，基本上肃清了两广历史上从未肃清过的匪患。同时，结合海防、边防和沿海渔民工作，使我们不仅清除了垃圾，也修理了门户，就是说：使我们不仅严重地打击了华南内地的各种反革命，也进一步巩固了海防和边防。整个华南的革命秩序，可说已经基本上安定了。但由于美英帝国主义与蒋介石匪帮相勾结，利用香港、澳门，不断派遣特务爪牙向大陆伺隙钻扰，因此，今后除继续贯彻城市和农村的镇压反革命以外，还要以足够的力量，转移到江中和沿海，把一百万渔民组织起来，坚决彻底肃清躲藏在天涯海角的敌人。
    在抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大政治运动的高潮鼓舞之下，华南人民在恢复生产，完成财政任务，加强货币管理，大力开展物资交流等方面，亦胜利地进行了各种生产建设和交通建设工作。公路修复和加强有国防作用的路线三千五百余公里。广东省一年水利建设工程已经超过了国民党反动统治二十多年的水利工程的总和。今年粮食早造稻谷增产达去年同时期的收获量百分之十，晚造一般的丰收，其他经济农作物和矿产也有显著增加。广西兴修水利灌溉达九十余万亩，较去年增产粮食百分之十。我们建立了黄埔港，健全了海关工作。目前，基本上杜绝了历史性的走私，私货种类已缩小到少数利润极高，体积极小的东西；据广州海关报告，在缉获物中，表、小五金、西药、糖精等占百分之五十三以上，比较笨重东西；几乎绝迹了。我们与帝国主义展开金融斗争，把长期流通在华南地区五万万余元的港币，基本上驱逐出去，目前港币，仅在港澳边沿及沿海岛屿个别地区，有少量秘密行使，已失却流通作用，估计现在残存在广东境内的港币，仅有三千万到五千万上下，大部在华侨眷属手中作储藏手段。最近由于农村斗争开展，农民拿大量金银（斗争果实）到银行兑换，因而使大量人民币进入农村。我们以大力掌握了物价，保持了物价的继续稳定，我们安置了归国难侨一万余人，使之参加各种工作或学习。顺便指出：现在华南正进行土特产交流大会，我们重视这件工作，我们把土特产展览作为华南地区经济力量的总检阅、总调查、总宣传和总交流，一方面用以进一步活跃城乡经济，促进工农业生产；一方面用来进行反对帝国主义和封建主义的斗争，并为将来计划生产进行某些必要的准备。
    我们在整个工作过程中，产生过许多缺点和错误；又由于工作继续开展，更感觉到责任的艰巨。但是，我们相信，在毛主席和中央人民政府领导下，只要我们全体工作干部能够实事求是，联系群众，坚持真理，遵守纪律，认真学习毛泽东思想和作风，那么，任务虽然艰巨，还是能够完成的。
    祝大会的成功！祝毛主席长寿无疆！祝全体委员们同志们身体健康！
　　中央人民政府华北事务部部长刘澜涛发言
    “发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我完全同意并拥护毛主席在开会词中的全部指示、周总理的政治报告和其他各位首长的报告。这些指示和报告，对于华北各级人民政府和全体人民来说，都是很适时的，很重要的。我们将根据华北地区的实际情况订出计划，组织力量，动员全体人民贯彻实现。
    首先，我们衷心地拥护这次会议关于抗美援朝工作的七项决议，随时准备响应祖国的一切号召，继续动员人力、物力、财力，积极完成支援朝鲜前线的一切任务。华北的人民，在抗日战争和解放战争时期，曾经光荣地尽到了他们对于祖国应该尽到的责任；在抗美援朝保家卫国的正义斗争中，同样能够尽到他们所应该尽到的责任。
    其次，我们要用更大的力量，发展生产，加强建设，以充实我们的国防力量。一年来，在抗美援朝爱国增产的口号下，我们的工业总产量、农业总产量都有了很大的增加；绝大多数国营工厂的生产水平，都超过了历史上最高年度的纪录，有的超过一倍甚至几倍。由于爱国增产和民主改革运动的深入，进一步发挥了工人阶级的伟大创造性：比如天津工人自制中速柴油机，自制无轨电车；太原机器厂创制六十五马力的截煤机；大同煤矿马六孩生产小组创造了快速掘进全国新纪录。目前我们正在进行清理资财、核定资金等项工作，为明年在国营企业中初步实行经济核算制打好基础。这次会议以后，我们将集中更大的力量，加强工业生产的领导，选派和培养更多的干部参加工业建设，以迎接祖国大规模经济建设时期的到来。
    华北的农业生产，在土地改革后三、四年以来，一般地已达到了抗日战争前的生产水平。棉花产量超过了战前的百分之五十五。去年全区农民有等于七十万万斤原粮的土产，业已推销出去，使农民的生活得到了相当改善，购买力有了很大的提高。但是所谓农业生产的战前水平，是指在帝国主义、封建势力、国民党反动派压迫下的生产水平，是历史上很可怜的生产水平。华北农民已清楚地表现出，他们绝不满足于这样的生产水平，他们要求和正在突破这种旧的生产水平，要求扩大再生产。在当前华北扩大再生产的中心问题是扩大单位面积的产量。各地的劳动模范在这一方面已创造了不少的先进经验，正鼓舞着广大的劳动农民，向着组织起来、互助合作、爱国丰产、丰衣足食的方向迈进。比如全国农业劳动模范李顺达在土地贫瘠的困难条件下，每亩玉米产量高达九百八十斤；河北省劳动模范张希舜每亩地产谷子一千三百斤；山西省曲耀离每亩棉花最高产量达九百二十斤；河北省马国荣每亩红薯产量在一万斤以上。为了满足农民扩大再生产的要求，我们已制定了十项农业建设计划，正在逐步加以实施。在工业、农业生产迅速恢复和发展的基础上，随之而来的就是城乡物资交流和公营私营的贸易事业有了重大的发展。
    今年华北的农业生产，遭受了严重的旱、虫、冻等项灾害。我们的农业增产，正是和这些严重的自然灾害作斗争中获得的。仅仅在今年扑灭蚜虫、蝗虫的斗争中即动员了一万万以上的人工。灾害给了我们很大的困难，但是由于毛主席的亲切关怀，国家的大力支援和广大劳动人民“人定胜天”的伟大精神，我们是有信心，有办法来逐渐克服这些困难的。
    第三、进一步加强和巩固我们的人民民主专政。一年来，我们坚决执行了中央人民政府所颁布的惩治反革命条例，发动和依靠了广大人民群众的积极性，镇压了万恶的反革命分子的活动，各界人民欢欣鼓舞，拍手称快，说：“这真是再一次翻身”，“比下一场透雨还痛快”。因而大大地提高了群众的政治觉悟和生产积极性，更进一步地巩固了人民内部的团结。对于镇压不彻底或虽有镇压而群众发动不够的地方，我们正在结合其它工作，逐区逐村进行切实的检查，克服新的麻痹思想，继续追捕逃犯和彻底肃清漏网的反革命分子，以保护人民的生命财产和各项建设工作。我们对敌人实行了镇压、专政；而在人民的内部则实行广泛的民主。从华北来看，人民民主专政是更加巩固了，并从各方面证明了它的优越性。一年以来，华北各级人民代表会议的工作，有了显著的进步。为了进一步扩大人民政府的群众基础，加强工人阶级的领导，把我们国家的基本制度加强和巩固起来，在中央人民政府政务院的领导下，最近我们召开过一次华北区的县长会议，决定除绥远若干县、旗外，所有各县、旗的各界人民代表会议，都在今冬明春有计划、有领导地代行人民代表大会职权，选举县长、副县长和县人民政府委员会，以便在政治上和组织上更广泛地更密切地联系各民主阶级的人民群众，更好地完成我们的各项工作任务。
    在大规模地镇压反革命的斗争中和广泛地发扬人民的民主生活中，华北的人民，更亲切地体会到对人民内部的民主和对敌人的专政，是统一而不可分离的，有如车之两轮，鸟之两翼的统一而不可分离一样。
    第四、华北人民在生活获得改善，政治觉悟日益提高的情况下，普遍、热烈地要求我们加强文教和卫生工作。这次中央老区访问团到华北各地农村后一致地感觉到了这一点。大家争着要识字、看报，学习科学知识；要求迅速建立中学、师范；要求新的娱乐生活；要求多开药铺，设立医院；特别希望我们注重妇婴卫生，推广新的接生法。这些要求是值得十分重视的。我们准备于一九五二年内，在各省人民政府统一计划下，由一县单独筹设或由数县联合筹设中学、师范和农业技术学校。在各县普遍组织医生联合会，有重点地建立医疗所，团结中、西医生，遍走农村，为群众看病；大量训练民间接生员，减少婴儿的死亡率。我们很诚恳地希望城市里的知识分子和医生能够更多地下乡工作，我们热烈地欢迎城市里的剧团、文工团、电影队能经常下乡活动，以推进和加强农村中的文教卫生工作。
    第五、为了抗美援朝的胜利、金融的稳定、生产的发展，和干部政治上的健康不受损害，在华北同样需要开展增加生产、厉行节约、反对铺张浪费、严惩贪污的工作。这是一项很重要的政治任务。我们准备和今年冬季全区干部的整风工作结合进行，鼓励那些全心全意为人民服务、爱护公共财产、廉洁奉公的干部；揭发、批评和纠正那些对国家对人民不负责任的铺张浪费现象；处分和严惩那些贪污腐化分子。
    大会所给予我们的指示，是我们的光荣任务，同时也加重了我们的责任。我相信在毛主席的英明领导下，依靠华北全体人民的团结一致和不疲倦地对毛泽东思想的学习，这些任务是能够完成的。最后，让我用毛主席赠给老根据地人民的题词——“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”来勉励我们自己，来结束我的讲话。
    上海医学院教授黄家驷发言
    决心尽一切力量医好志愿军伤病员主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    在这次会议上，我们听了毛主席的开会词和各位首长的报告。我代表到会的医务工作者表示热烈的拥护。毛主席明确地指示我们，加强抗美援朝的工作，是中国人民今天的中心任务。毫无疑义地，这更是有关直接支援前线的医务工作者的中心任务。我们医务工作者必须坚决地和我们英勇的人民志愿军共同站在抗美援朝的最前线！
    自从美帝国主义发动了侵略朝鲜同时侵占我台湾轰炸我东北的战争以来，全国的医务工作者卷入了抗美援朝保家卫国这一伟大运动的热潮。当着我们的志愿军为了祖国的安全，为了支援朝鲜人民反抗美帝国主义的侵略在朝鲜战场出现，全国的医务工作者便纷纷自动报名参加抗美援朝志愿医疗手术队，现在已有三千多个医务工作者参加了这一光荣的行列。
    在工作中，全体支援前线的医务工作者表现了无比的热忱。当任务来到的时候，他们是日夜不停地为伤病员进行清洁、整顿、查病、换药等工作，大家都能不分彼此，互相合作，争取在一定时间内完成任务。忙的时候，他们可以连续三十六小时工作着。为了照顾重伤的战士，他们可以整夜地守着，牺牲自己的睡眠。为了要使伤病员能吃着热饭，他们可以自己不吃饭。为了争取伤病员早日恢复健康，他们不顾自己的健康，带病工作。甚至有的医务人员被传染了，他们一个一个地病倒了，但不能阻止其他同志更认真更热忱地去工作。
    他们对伤病员都怀着无限的热爱。伤病员的痛苦就是他们的痛苦。为了要解除伤病员的痛苦，他们可以做一切的工作。除了医疗工作外，很多的同志替伤病员补衣服洗衣服，给他们读报，教他们认字，教他们唱歌，帮助他们进行文化和政治的学习。更有不少的同志把自己的血输给重伤的战士，使他们度过了危机，恢复了健康。我们和伤病员不仅是医务人员和病人的关系，而是同一阶级的弟兄。
    在工作中，不是没有困难的。然而我们决不向困难低头。建立血库可以保证血的供应，因此，在一个收容重伤时常作大手术的医院是必要的。血库的必要设备是能保持一定温度的冰箱。有一个医疗队没有冰箱，就想到利用地洞。他们在不同的时间测量地洞内和地洞外的温度。在地洞外白天和晚上温度差得很多，而在地洞内毫无改变，因此，他们得着了世界上最大的冰箱。在实验工作上，细菌的培养需要一定温度的暖箱。有一个医疗队没有暖箱，就自己做一木箱，靠着医院原有的火墙。火墙的温度是不平均的。他们用一根绳子把木箱拉上拉下，以取得适当的温度。这些都说明了支援前线的医务工作者能发挥他们的创造性，克服一切的困难。
    我们不但是自己做着这些工作，我们团结着部队里和我们共同工作的医务干部，互相学习，共同进步。我们深深地感觉到我们的人数有限，我们的能力也是有限的，只有把我们的技术教给更多的同志，才能使更多的伤病员可以更好地恢复健康。因此，我们每个医疗队员都把我们所知道的毫无保留地教给部队同志，同时我们也学习他们的刻苦耐劳克服困难的工作作风。
    同志们，前线的工作深深地教育了每个医务工作者。面对着我们，是英勇无比的中国人民志愿军。他们为了祖国，贡献出整个的生命。当他们流了血，负了伤来到医院的时候，是那样的不居功，不骄傲，服从治疗，安心休养。当他们伤好病好的时候，又是那样愉快地重返前线。他们心里没有一刻想到自己，而是没有一刻不想到祖国。当一个人从麻药醒转而没有全醒的时候，是不会说假话的。在这样时候，我们的伤员只有两句话：一是“杀呀，杀死那些美国鬼子！”一是“毛主席万岁！”这两句话，我们是听了一遍又一遍了，但是每一遍都打动了我们的心。在这样工作中，我们是深切地体会到什么叫做“全心全意为人民服务”了！
    前线的工作也加强了我们对于技术和政治相结合的认识。我们亲眼看见了祖国的大好河山，亦看见了全国的工人农民都在积极生产，全国的人民都在积极支援前线。中国有了空前的大团结，中国实现了有史以来的真正的统一。我们也亲眼看见了美帝国主义是怎样的残杀朝鲜的和平人民，怎样的伤害我们的英勇的人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军。美帝国主义决心要破坏我们艰苦得来的胜利果实，要破坏那全国人民和全世界人民所一致要求的和平生活。在这样的实际生活中，帮助了我们更加尖锐地辨别是非敌我，加深了我们对祖国对人民的热爱，加深了对美帝国主义的仇恨，因此，也就督促了我们必须尽一切力量医好伤病员，使他们迅速地重返前线去杀敌。因此，我们的医疗工作，不仅是一种单纯的技术任务，而是具体的加强战斗力量保证战斗胜利的政治任务了！
    同志们，有不少的医务工作者在前线发挥了他们的力量，也有不少的医务工作者在实际工作中教育了自己，改造了自己。在美帝国主义还没有得着最后的打击、不甘失败的时候，前线需要更多的医务工作者。这不但是我们的神圣义务，也是我们的光荣权利！让我们团结起来，在毛主席的领导下，为加速抗美援朝保家卫国的最后胜利而更勇敢地更坚决地走向前线！
    台湾民主自治同盟主席谢雪红发言
    中国人民决心从美国侵略者手中解放台湾主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    毛主席所领导的新中国是光荣的，是伟大的，是强大起来了，从全国委员会第二次会议到第三次会议开会期间，十六个月来，新中国在各方面所获得的成就与进展，都充分表现了中国人民民主统一战线的扩大和巩固，都充分说明了新中国的强大！
    我谨代表台湾民主自治同盟，祝贺大会胜利成功！并向毛主席和中国共产党致崇高的敬礼！
    我完全拥护毛主席在大会开会词中所指示的政治方针，并完全同意周总理的政治报告及其他各项报告，并愿为实现此方针作坚决的奋斗！
    毛主席所指示的方针以及大会上的各项报告，完全符合目前国内外的政治局势，和体现了中国人民反对美帝国主义侵略，力争和平并努力国家建设的伟大愿望。这一正确的方针，一定得到全国人民的拥护，一定在实施过程中，获得比过去更伟大的成就。我在此要指出，渴望解放的台湾人民他们听到全国委员会开会的消息，听到毛主席的开会词，他们就直接看到了解放台湾的光明与希望，因为新中国的强大和抗美援朝在朝鲜前线的胜利，便是台湾必能解放，一定要解放的保证。
    一年来中国人民抗美援朝保家卫国运动已经得到了辉煌的胜利，这是把美帝国主义侵略势力赶出中国大陆后的又一次反对帝国主义的大胜利，这个胜利同时也大大鼓舞了亚洲人民的斗争意志，这个胜利增强了保卫亚洲和世界和平的力量。
    毛主席在此次会议的开会词中说：“大家都明白，如果不是美国军队占领我国的台湾、侵略朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和打到了我国的东北边疆，中国人民是不会和美国军队作战的。”台湾人民深刻理解抗美援朝的正义性，他们知道在朝鲜前线大量消灭帝国主义侵略势力的胜利将是解放台湾的有利条件。这一年来抗美援朝的胜利，更鼓舞了台湾人民，坚信台湾一定要解放，推动了他们加紧准备解放台湾的工作。
    在大陆上的台湾同胞积极响应祖国的号召，踊跃参军，制订爱国公约，倾力捐献，大陆上南北各地台湾同胞不少捐出了金镯首饰，节食省用，积极生产，积极参加各种政治活动，表现了他们热爱祖国，争取最后胜利的热忱。
    台湾人民目前仍在美帝国主义与蒋匪帮的联合压迫之下，其痛苦当然是很深重的。美帝国主义进占台湾，正经营台湾作为进攻新中国和破坏世界和平的战争基地。蒋介石匪帮卑鄙下流，无耻已极，投靠在美帝国主义怀抱中，企图逃脱中国人民的惩罚。我们想想一个七百万人口的海岛作为数十万美国侵略军与蒋匪军的巢穴，一切搜括压榨，剥削屠杀的手段都集中用在台湾人民的头上。美帝国主义与蒋匪帮的联合罪行是中国人民与台湾人民所绝不能宽恕和容许的。
    台湾人民与日本帝国主义作了半世纪的斗争，最后与祖国的大陆人民共同打败了日本帝国主义，仅仅根据这一经验、从长期斗争中取得胜利的经验，加上现在祖国的强大和一年来在朝鲜前线的胜利，台湾的解放一定要实现是毫无疑义的！根据最近台湾的情况来看，台湾人民并没有屈服，反对美国侵略者和蒋匪帮的斗争并未间断过，解放台湾的工作台湾人民也正在准备着。这是可以告慰祖国父老兄弟和姊妹们的！
    我台湾民主自治同盟在祖国大陆参加各项建设的同志，深深知道祖国大陆的全体人民和毛主席与中央人民政府各首长没有一个人不是在时刻地关心着台湾人民的。我台湾民主自治同盟的同志们愿将毛主席和中央人民政府的意志传达给全台湾人民，努力进行各项解放台湾的准备工作。我们的战斗口号便是周总理在政治报告中所提示的：“中国人民决心从美国侵略者手中解放台湾，不达目的，决不罢休！”
    河北省协商委员会副主席王葆真发言
    为贯彻中央各项政策和七项决议而奋斗主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我代表河北省协商委员会，很荣幸地听到毛主席的开会词。毛主席的开会词指示我们要增加生产，厉行节约，支援中国人民志愿军为中心任务。又听到周总理报告：“广泛地有系统地组织对于毛泽东思想的学习。”我们完全拥护这两个指示。这不仅是加强了抗美援朝的工作；加速了民主专政的建设；并且是全国人民的思想，改造，前进，觉悟，团结，最良好的一个进步的过程。同时也是稳定物价，发展经济，保障人民生活，促进新社会的共同福利所必须经由的步骤，所以我们要坚决拥护，为了增产节约而奋斗，为了组织毛泽东思想的学习而奋斗。我们又听到陈叔通副主席，彭真副主席，陈云副总理，郭沫若副总理，四个报告，以及抗美援朝的决议。我们完全拥护；并保证为贯彻执行中央政策和这一决议而奋斗。
    现在，我把河北省协商委员会一年来的工作，怎样努力贯彻实行中央的政策和法令？很简略地报告一下：
    在去年十一月一日，河北省人民政府杨主席领导召开了全省各界人民代表会议。代表近六百人。在开会的第一天，我们就通过了决议，拥护抗美援朝的政策。许多劳动模范代表，提出了生产竞赛，支援前线的议案。全会一致发动了抗美援朝的运动。选举了委员七十五人，成立省协商委员会。
    省协商委员会成立以来，工作人员首先组织了学习会，学习毛泽东思想，和马列主义的理论。在常务委员会以外，召开了三次全体委员会，并联合各界开了十一次座谈会，我会尽力协助政府工作，并配合各项组织，动员人民，开展抗美援朝爱国主义运动，为经常重要工作。曾经为了响应抗美援朝总会的三大号召，为了反对美帝国主义单独对日媾和，拥护苏联代表在旧金山会议讲话，为了优抚，捐献等项，我会曾经深入地、普遍地发出六次号召。许多代表和县常务委员会，都积极地响应了本会号召，热烈地开展了运动。许多工人代表如张金满、于顺正、孙连旺等，推动了爱国生产竞赛的开展，提出“工厂就是战场，机器就是枪炮，多生产就等于多消灭敌人”的口号。农民代表如高贯斗、孙玉峰、钱钟仁等，领导农村开展了爱国生产运动，在“强国发家多种棉花”的口号下，进行了大规模的抗旱点种，并领导订立了生产竞赛计划。
    各位：今年四五月间，河北甚旱，已届立夏，种上的棉田，不过七百万亩，可是中央给予河北的任务，是一千四百万亩，杨主席为了完成任务，号召抗旱点种。农村老少男女，挑水到田野去点种棉花，结果超过完成任务一千七百万亩，又遇着棉蚜虫灾，一棵棉，要治蚜虫五六次，还损失了近二百万亩。河北省本年的棉产约计可得三万万斤以上的皮棉，可解决一万万人民衣服的原料。但是，我们应当想到一尺布，一根线，都代表了人民的多少的劳力，多少的苦辛。我们为了支持抗美援朝，为了体念人民的劳苦和物力的艰难，都是应该努力实行毛主席的指示：厉行节约的政策。
    此外，学校代表如孙开山、王量宏等举行了扩大宣传。工商业界代表如王启疆、李耀堂、申希礼、赵少农、白铁石、晁约德等，推动了工商业界，热烈地开展了爱国主义运动。许多城镇如保定、石家庄、唐山、秦皇岛、邢台、通镇、临清、泊镇等的工商业界，开展了爱国纳税竞赛。又有许多青年、妇女、回民、宗教各界代表，都领导参加了这一运动，因此，我省抗美援朝和签订爱国公约的运动在各个角落里都汹涌地开展起来了。因此，河北省人民在连年的水灾旱灾虫灾严重的情形下，捐献了战斗飞机八十三架。
    我会在协助政府镇压反革命的工作上，曾号召代表和各县常务委员会，大力协助政府认真贯彻执行。有的在会议上实行了民主审案、量刑，正确地贯彻了政策，严重地打击了反革命气焰，伸张了人民的正气。
    河北土地改革工作，是早已完成了。我们代替这一运动，作了两件事：
    一是我们曾经开了扩大会议，邀请几十名工商界代表，研究、讨论了工会法，并保证有效地实施。开展了依靠工人阶级，搞好生产的思想，开展了劳资合作的实际运动，开展了工人参加管理工厂事务的初步阶段。
        一是我会今夏组织了农村参观团，到老区参观，看到经过土地改革的农民翻身以后，团结，互助，发展生产建设，在抗美援朝，镇压反革命，开展生产竞赛，踊跃捐献，积极表现了高度的热情和政治觉悟的提高，农民认识了我们的政府，真是人民的政府了。
    其次，我们在河北省协商委员会第三次全体会议，专为了学习并讨论刘少奇副主席在北京市第三届人民代表会议上的讲话，和中央关于民主建政的法令。我们根据民主政权的意义，作了决议，推行了民主建政的工作。
    我会的工作，还有缺点，就是专门委员会没成立起来，因此，有多少工作，作的还不够。准备今后组织成立，希望全国委员会加以明确的指导，这也是民主政权中一个中心环节，我们愿接受批评和指示。
    我会的各项工作，能得到顺利的进展，在地方上是由于杨主席，和中共省委，地委，各级干部，以身作则，领导一切的运动，我会不过努力协助其进行。在全面来讲，是由于毛主席和中央人民政府正确的领导，制定的政策法令，完全符合广大人民的意志和要求。
    我现在代表河北省协商委员会向伟大英明的领袖毛主席，向中国共产党，向全国委员会各委员各同志，向战斗英雄们，向劳动模范代表们致以最崇高最热爱的敬礼。
    教育工作者代表史瑞芬发言
    用革命办法克服困难办好人民教育主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我们教育工作者听了毛主席的开会词，周总理的政治报告，和各位首长的报告，一致拥护，并坚决执行。我们教育工作者今天能列席全国人民政治协商会议，都感到无上光荣。就拿我来说吧，我是个乡村小学教师，今天不但能列席全国人民政治协商会议，并且能在大会上发言，这是在旧社会里从来没有过的事情，只有毛主席给我们带来了光明和幸福！开辟了广阔前途。我们衷心地感谢毛主席，感谢中国共产党！
    新中国是革命的中国，是人民的中国；新教育是革命的教育，是人民的教育。我们教育工作者，必须用革命办法来完成祖国交给我们的光荣和艰巨的任务。什么是革命办法？要有克服一切困难的决心和勇气，坚决地依靠群众，走群众路线；并且不断地进行自我批评，发挥高度的创造精神，全心全意为人民教育服务。过去几年来我们老区和新区的人民教育事业，就是用了这种革命的办法，才有了这巨大的成就。我在清水塘小学，亲身实地经验过，只有运用这革命办法，才是办好人民教育的正确路线。
    就拿我个人办理清水塘小学的经过，来作为一个例证吧：
    清水塘是苏南溧阳县城西北三十里的一个荒僻村庄，曾遭受过日寇的烧杀掳掠，又加上连年灾荒和反动统治跟地主的压榨，农民们终年过着悲惨的生活，许多青年农民沾染了赌博、抽烟的恶习，因而有“二流子村”的外号；解放后，又碰上了荒年，村中生活最好的中农李信开家，也是喝着大麦糊汤过日子。清水塘小学呢？是一所破旧的祠堂，连大门都没有。以前这位先生是喝酒、糊涂，冬天睡懒觉，夏天乘风凉。一九四九年寒假放学时，只剩下三个儿童，学校等于垮了台。
    我是去年四月一日到清水塘小学去工作的。熟悉清水塘情形的人都为我耽心，说那边的地方太苦，学生很少，过去是个土匪窝，……。但是我的意志很坚定，毫不动摇，毅然决然地接受了这个任务。我到了清水塘，那里的农民，看到我是个土头土脑的女教师，纷纷议论说：“去了一个叫化子，换来一个讨饭佬。”甚至讥讽着：“今年村上要发财了，鸡婆也用来请灵官（蚕神）了！”我听到了这些话语，更坚定了自己的意志。并深切地想：毛主席不是指示我们走群众路线克服困难吗？对，要办好人民学校，必定先要跟群众打成一片。
    首先和群众共甘苦。那时群众正忙着生产救灾，我就请人做了一个小泥灶，在一所矮小的茅屋里，自己煮饭，也喝着糊汤度日与群众吃油树皮红花草。有时跟群众无拘无束地谈谈笑笑，替他们画个花样，算算账，写封信。一个六十三岁的三老妈妈说：“史先生一点架子也没有，不小看人，真是个好先生！”我就这样慢慢和群众靠拢了。
    学校开学时，只有十八个学生。我了解了不上学的原因以后，便进行动员说服，尽力设法照顾，到暑假，就增加到四十一名。今年春季开学，已有七十个学生。同时我把村干部和家长请来，组织校务委员会，共同克服困难，办好学校。去年暑期里，我从苏州学习回校。校务委员会已做好招生工作，修好了桌凳，只等我回去上课。今年春天群众又自动帮助学校修建校舍，捐献了木工、泥工、小工共二百一十个工，开垦了八亩荒田。
    清水塘的群众，绝大部分是文盲。我时常和他们谈不识字的苦，鼓励他们学文化。那时村干部常到区里去开会，因为不识字不会记录，常把重要事情忘掉了，深感有学习文化的迫切需要。在早稻登场之后，农民们用打柴、摸鱼等生产解决了经费问题，冬学识字班就正式开学了。一开学，六十一个学员中，只有四个妇女，我便分头到各家去访问，搞通了她们和家长跟丈夫的思想，一下就有十七个妇女上冬学。土地改革以后，群众学习文化更迫切，学员人数增加到一百十六人，旁听的还有二、三十人。
    冬学教学，紧紧配合着中心工作。如在土地改革时，以土地改革、反封建为中心内容，打通群众思想，贯彻土地改革法令，顺利地完成了土地改革工作。在春节以前，进行了拥军优属教育。全村军属共有田三十六亩，被八十一个农会会员抢先代耕了。除夕那天，把丰盛的年礼，敲锣打鼓，送到了军属家里。又不断宣传目前的政治形势，澄清群众的糊涂思想，发动群众订爱国公约，增产捐献飞机大炮，大力展开抗美援朝运动。而且掀起学习热潮，大家把教人识字当成一件光荣的事。冬学结束，通过评选模范和文化诉苦，顺利地转入了常年民校。
    我这个例子，只是全国上百万人民教师中的一个。我们坚信：在目前和今后一定时期内的革命和战争环境里，只有用革命办法，才可以把人民教育在任何困难情况下坚持下去，而且才可以达到发展提高的目的。
    毛主席的开会词，周总理的政治报告和其他各位首长报告，给我们极重要的启示，和极大的鼓舞。我们教育工作者，保证在毛泽东思想领导下，更进一步地团结一致，发扬艰苦奋斗的作风，为了国家的长远利益，担负起培养新中国后一代的重大任务，我们完全有信心有力量来完成这个光荣的任务。
    全国教师们，在光辉的毛泽东旗帜下奋勇前进！
    我们伟大的毛主席万岁！
