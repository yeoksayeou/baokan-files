For thirty-four years, from the Great October Socialist Revolution to the present day, the Soviet film industry, under the wise guidance of Lenin and Stalin and with the concern and leadership of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government, has achieved brilliant successes and produced countless works with a high degree of ideological and artistic merit. These works, with their Bolshevik Party spirit and socialist realism, correctly handled the image of the people, correctly represented the lives and labor, struggles and hopes of the Soviet people. They reflected the great socialist revolution carried out by the Soviet people under the wise leadership of Lenin and Stalin, the victory of the Soviet people in bravely defeating stubborn enemies at home and abroad, the growing strength of the world's peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the selfless labor of the Soviet people under the great banner of Lenin and Stalin for a better communist society.

These brilliant works also relentlessly exposed the shameless rumors and slanders made by capitalist countries against socialist Soviet Union with their indisputable authenticity, and at the same time dealt the most serious blow to those hypocritical, shameless, and poisonous film productions headed by American imperialism in the eyes of the people. All progressive and conscientious literary and film workers around the world have their eyes on the Soviet Union, are learning from the Soviet Union, and are eager to see more Soviet film productions.

Around the time of the "September 18th" Incident in 1931, China was in an increasingly deep national crisis. It was at this time that Soviet films began to gradually spread to China. Of course, the reactionary rulers at that time did not allow Soviet films to have a large-scale screening opportunity. For example, in Shanghai, although there were dozens of cinemas, only a very few showed Soviet films, and before the films were shown, they were obstructed in many ways, and when they were shown, they were often filled with secret agents, as if facing a formidable enemy. In order to watch a Soviet film, the audience had to prepare to be followed, beaten with sticks, or even dragged into jail! But workers, students, progressive literary and film workers still secretly watched them, and if they didn't see them enough once, they would watch them several times in a row.

At that time, in the Chinese film market, in addition to most of the productions being made by American imperialism, most of the Chinese productions were still trapped in the quagmire of gods, monsters, martial arts, and mandarin ducks and butterflies. Due to the education of social reality and revolutionary thought, and after being exposed to Soviet films and Soviet film theory, a glimmer of dawn dawned in the minds of some progressive film workers, and they began to make films with new perspectives and new styles. This quickly formed the "era of transformation" in the style of Chinese films at that time. From then on, progressive films began to appear on the Chinese film scene. Those works, to a certain extent, exposed the darkness of reactionary rule, reflected the suffering of the people, and resolutely demanded resistance against Japan, thus winning the enthusiastic support of a considerable number of workers, students, citizens, and all those who did not want to be slaves of a conquered nation.

Of course, after progressive productions formed a trend, the reactionary rulers would not forget to inflict devastation and persecution on such works and their authors. Many films were banned or cut to pieces. In addition, they used terrorist tactics, intimidation, and arrests.

But the awakened film workers would not yield. They heard the heroic struggle of the Chinese Communist Party and the people in the dark and cold, and when they thought of the bright land of the Soviet Union, they felt excited and warmed. Some of them went to the liberated areas and directly participated in the ranks of struggle, while others, no matter how dangerous the environment, persisted in their work until the liberation of the whole country.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the assistance that the young Chinese people's film industry received from Soviet film workers, and the direct and indirect role played by a large number of Soviet films among Chinese film workers and the broad masses of the people, can be said to be inestimable.

As is well known, of the 400 films shown in old China each year, 300 were poisonous productions of American imperialism, and less than 100 were made by Chinese themselves. Although the number of Soviet films coming to China was not small, they could not be widely shown due to the obstruction of the reactionary rulers. With the birth of New China, the people themselves took control of political power, and the political level of the broad audience also improved. Thus, the poisonous productions of American imperialism were gradually eliminated, and replaced by the productions of the people of New China and the productions of the Soviet Union. When the Chinese people's movement to resist America and aid Korea was vigorously launched, the Chinese people unanimously demanded that the remaining American and British films be thoroughly eliminated. Hollywood's poisonous films have since disappeared from China. New China's own films and Soviet films dubbed in Chinese have been increasingly welcomed by the broad masses of the people. According to incomplete statistics, in 1950, the number of viewers of Soviet films reached more than 50 million.

In the half-year from January to June 1951, the number of viewers had jumped to nearly 40 million, and it will definitely increase day by day thereafter. Some Soviet films, such as "The Fall of Berlin," had more than 5.3 million viewers from 1950 to October 1951;

"The Battle of Stalingrad" had more than 4.2 million viewers in 1950; and the newly released "Brave People" had as many as 1.4 million viewers. As long as our equipment and material supply work can be greatly developed, then the number of viewers will increase infinitely.

These facts illustrate how deeply the broad masses of the Chinese people love Soviet films. Through films, the broad masses of the people are learning from the Soviet Union, learning advanced experience in struggle and production and construction, and learning the selfless spirit of striving to realize communism. All organized groups often watch them collectively, and when they return, they launch heated discussions and put what they have learned into practice in their work and lives.

The film workers of New China are also constantly learning from Soviet films. Watching Soviet films has become a "compulsory course" for all creative cadres and all artistic cadres. The translation and publication of Soviet film theory is also being carried out regularly, in considerable quantities, and in a planned manner. Our film workers are constantly studying and learning from these brilliant works and writings from the Soviet Union in order to improve their ideological and artistic level in creation. The reason why the young Chinese people's film industry has a relatively good performance is primarily due to the kind concern and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the responsible leaders of the Central Committee. In addition, it is due to the enormous and unparalleled influence and assistance given by Soviet films in all aspects.

The influence and assistance that the broad masses of the Chinese people and Chinese film workers have received from Soviet films has been considerable for many years, is broad and profound, and as time progresses, will be so great that it cannot be estimated. In short, Soviet films have been, are, and will be the most intimate teachers, friends, and one of the most important and indispensable spiritual foods for the broad masses of the Chinese people and Chinese film workers.

The Chinese people's film industry has gradually grown in various tests. Chinese film workers, following our pioneers—the glorious Soviet film workers—will continue to contribute even greater strength in the great and just action of defending world peace!

On the occasion of the 34th anniversary of the Great October Revolution, and at the time when the brilliant Soviet Film Exhibition is being held in China, as a Chinese film worker, I would like to express my heartfelt congratulations to the great revolutionary teacher, Marshal Stalin, and the beloved great Soviet people! And to all the dear Soviet film workers, I extend my heartfelt thanks and fraternal and warm greetings!

    苏联电影对中国电影事业的影响和帮助
    ——庆祝“苏联影片展览”开幕
    蔡楚生
    从伟大的苏联社会主义十月革命到现在，三十四年来，苏联的电影事业在列宁和斯大林英明的教导之下，在布尔什维克党、苏联政府的关心和领导之下，它获得了辉煌的成就，产生了无数有着高度的思想性与艺术性的作品。这些作品，以它的布尔什维克党性，以它的社会主义现实主义，正确地处理了人民的形象，正确地表现了苏联人民的生活与劳动，斗争与希望。它反映了苏联人民在列宁、斯大林英明的领导之下所进行的伟大的社会主义革命，它反映了苏联人民英勇地击败了国内外顽强敌人的胜利，它反映了以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营力量的日趋强大，它反映了苏联人民在伟大的列宁、斯大林的旗帜下为着美好的共产主义社会而进行的忘我的劳动。
    这些光辉的作品，也以它无可争辩的真实性，无情地揭露了资本主义国家对社会主义的苏联所作的无耻的造谣和诬蔑，同时也使以美帝国主义为首的那些虚伪无耻和饱含毒素的电影制作，在人民的面前受到了最严重的打击。全世界进步的有良心的文艺工作者和电影工作者，所有的眼睛都向着苏联，都在学习苏联，而渴望能多看到苏联的电影制作。
    一九三一年“九一八”事变前后，中国正处于日益深重的民族危机之中。苏联电影就在这时开始陆续流传到中国来。当然，那时的反动统治者是不容许苏联电影有较大规模的映出机会的。譬如在上海，虽则有几十家影院，却就只有很少的几家映过苏联片，而且在片子放映前既被多方阻难，放映时往往又是特务密布，如临大敌。为了看一次苏联电影，观众还得准备被跟踪，吃棍子，甚或被拉到监牢里去！但工人、学生、进步的文艺工作者和电影工作者还是偷偷去看，一次看不够，还要连着看几次。
    那时在中国的电影市场上，除了大部分是美帝国主义的制作之外，中国人自己的制作大多数还陷在神怪武侠、鸳鸯蝴蝶的泥沼中。由于社会现实和革命思想的教育，以及接触到苏联电影，和苏联的电影理论以后，一部分进步的电影工作者的头脑中就投进了一线的曙光，他们开始以新的观点和新的作风来制作电影。这就迅速地形成了当时中国电影在作风上的“转变时代”。从这以后，进步的电影就开始在中国的影坛上出现了，那些作品在某一程度上暴露了反动统治的黑暗，反映了民生的疾苦，和坚决要求对日抗战，因而获得了相当多量的工人、学生、市民和所有不愿做亡国奴的人们热烈的拥护。
    当然，在进步的制作形成了一种趋向之后，反动的统治者是不会忘记对这种作品和它的作者施以摧残迫害的。许多片子遭到禁演或者被剪得体无完肤。此外，就是使用恐怖手段，进行威吓、逮捕。
    但觉醒了的电影工作者是不会屈服的，他们在阴暗寒冷中听到了中国共产党和人民英勇的斗争，想到了苏联那一片光明的土地，就觉兴奋，就觉温暖，他们有的投向解放区，直接参加了斗争的行列，有的不管环境如何险恶，还在坚持着工作，直到全国解放。
    中华人民共和国成立以后，年青的中国人民电影事业所获得的苏联电影工作者的帮助，以及大量的苏联电影在中国电影工作者和广大的人民群众中直接间接所起的作用之大，可以说是无法估计的了。
    如所周知，过去在旧中国所放映的电影，每年总数四百部中就有三百部是美帝国主义那些饱含毒素的制作，国人自制的片子则一百部还不到，苏联电影来华的部数虽不少，但因受反动统治者的阻挠，却不可能作很广泛的演出。随着新中国的诞生，人民自己掌握了政权，广大观众的政治水平也提高了，因而逐步清除美帝国主义那些毒素制作，代替他的是新中国人民自己的制作，和苏联的制作。当中国人民抗美援朝的运动蓬勃展开起来的时候，中国人民一致要求彻底地把残余的美英影片予以肃清。好莱坞的充满毒素的影片在中国从此绝迹。新中国自己的电影，和配有华语对白的苏联电影日益受到了广大人民的欢迎。据不完全的统计，一九五○年看苏联电影的观众已达五千万人以上，
    一九五一年从一月到六月的半年间，观众的数字已跃增到近四千万人，而且此后必将与日俱增。有的苏联影片，如：“攻克柏林”，从一九五○年到一九五一年十月，观众的数字是五百三十余万人；
    “斯大林格勒大会战”，一九五○年的观众是四百二十余万人；而发行不久的“勇敢的人”，观众的数字即已达一百四十万人之多。只要我们的器材设备以及材料的供应工作能够得到长足的发展，那么观众的数字还要无限度地激增起来的。
    这些，说明了中国广大的人民大众是如何地热爱着苏联电影，通过电影，广大的人民在向苏联学习，学习先进的斗争经验和生产建设经验，学习那种忘我的为实现共产主义而奋斗的精神。所有有组织的群众常常集体去看，他们回来就展开了热烈的讨论，把学习所得，很好地在工作和生活中贯彻下去。
    新中国的电影工作者更是无时不在向苏联电影学习，所有的创作干部和一切的艺术干部，看苏联电影已成为“必修之课”，苏联电影理论的译述和出版工作，也是经常而相当多量地和有计划地在做着的。我们的电影工作者，从苏联这些光辉的作品和著作中，作不断的钻研，不断的学习，用以提高创作中的思想水平和艺术水平。这样年青的中国人民电影事业，它之所以有着较为良好的表现，这首先是由于中国共产党和毛主席，以及中央负责首长们亲切的关怀与正确的领导，此外，就得归功于苏联电影从各方面所给予的巨大无比的影响和帮助。
    中国广大的人民和中国的电影工作者所受于苏联电影的影响和帮助，是已经有相当长的年月的，是广泛而又深刻的，而且随着时间的进展，将是巨大到无法加以估计的。总之，苏联电影在过去、在今天、在未来，都是中国广大的人民大众和中国的电影工作者最亲密的良师益友，也是最重要的不可或缺的精神粮食之一。
    中国人民的电影事业已经在各种考验中逐渐成长起来了，中国的电影工作者追随着我们的先驱——光荣的苏联电影工作者，在保卫世界和平这一伟大而正义的行动中，必将继续不断地贡献其更大的力量！
    在伟大的十月革命三十四周年纪念的时候，在光辉的苏联电影正在中国举行盛大的放映展览的时候，作为一个中国的电影工作者，我谨衷心地向伟大的革命导师斯大林大元帅和亲爱的伟大的苏联人民致最热烈的祝贺！并向全苏联亲爱的电影工作者致衷心的感谢和兄弟般的热烈的敬礼！
