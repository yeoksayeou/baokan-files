    Reading Group Activities
    Responding to Chairman Mao's Great Call for Increased Production and Economy
    Donglin Reading Group Formulates Measures for Increased Production and Economy
    Editor Comrade: We are a reading group from a warehouse. In order to respond to Chairman Mao's call at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy in order to support the Chinese People's Volunteers, we conscientiously studied Chairman Mao's opening speech, Vice Premier Chen Yun's report on economic and financial work, and Comrade Li Fuchun's speech. Combined with our past experience in saving materials, repairing waste products, and increasing the country's wealth, we have a deeper understanding of the great significance of Chairman Mao's call to launch a nationwide campaign to increase production and practice economy.
    For more than half a year, our reading and learning has never been interrupted. The heroic spirit of the Volunteers fighting in Korea has inspired the patriotic enthusiasm of each of us. After the General Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea issued the call for increased production and donations, our group began to change the past attitude of simply receiving and issuing materials, and automatically and actively inventoried and sorted out materials that had been accumulated for more than ten years. Those that were not needed for the time being were turned over to the state. Many old and rusty things that were previously considered waste products can still be used after everyone brushed off the rust and oiled them. Many discarded copper elbow joints, after being repaired, had their sales value increased twenty-five times per kilogram. In the week of celebrating National Day alone, our group of twenty-four people rushed to repair five tons of discarded gas pipes, the value of which is equivalent to about 50,000 jin of millet.
    After this study, we are determined to take a step forward on the original basis and save more wealth for the country. In addition to ensuring the completion of the original plan of increasing 25,000 jin of millet for the country from repairing waste products this winter (currently 60% completed), our group will also more properly store, transport, and supervise the rational use of various materials, so that the inventory materials do not deteriorate, are damaged, or suffer other accidental losses. In conjunction with the recent factory-wide security inspection campaign, each of us has used our brains and formulated various work systems and clear dedicated responsibility systems. Taking fire prevention as an example, which is an important part of winter prevention work, we have specifically determined the various divisions of labor and actions in case of emergency, and have conducted several exercises. For the usual work, we have also meticulously divided the work, even to who is responsible for keeping newspapers and washing teacups, so that our work can be carried out in an orderly manner.
    The phenomenon of wasting materials also exists in our factory. In general, the material requisitioning departments always want to requisition more or requisition good materials for general purposes. For example, a department wants to requisition gas pipes for railings; a department only needs 4.5 meters of steel material, but wants to requisition 5 meters. Some have been saved or issued substitutes after our on-site inspection; but there must be many similar situations that have not been discovered by us. In the future, we must strengthen contact with various departments so that materials can be fully and rationally used, and thoroughly correct the wasteful phenomena of using large materials for small purposes, using whole materials for parts, and using superior materials for inferior purposes, which will save the country a lot of money!
    To increase production and save more wealth for the country to support the Volunteers is something that everyone keeps in mind. A few days ago, the administration wanted to send a gasoline truck to transport a small portion of materials. After everyone calculated, the cost of transportation was too high, and they immediately suggested using a charcoal truck instead. We think that starting from these "small things" and calculating carefully day after day, the amount will not be too small.
                                Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Donglin Reading Group
    Editor's note: The Donglin Reading Group is a relatively good reading group at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. They promptly studied the documents of the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and in conjunction with the work of this group, worked out measures to respond to Chairman Mao's call for "increasing production and practicing economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers" with practical actions. This approach should be universally promoted to reading groups across the country. Members of reading groups in various places should also carry out extensive publicity among the masses, repeatedly mobilize them, and implement Chairman Mao's call in all aspects, so that the campaign to increase production and practice economy becomes a nationwide mass movement. In order to exchange the experiences of reading groups in various places in this study, you are welcome to write to us frequently to report advanced experiences, methods, and achievements.
    How Guanyuanzi Transformed
    —Introducing the Activities of the Guanyuanzi Reading Group
    The Guanyuanzi Citizens' Reading Group in the Second District of Guihua City has fully utilized the role of the people in self-education, improved the awareness of the masses, and completely changed the appearance of this area.
    Before the establishment of the reading group in Guanyuanzi, the masses' thinking was very backward, and they did not care about any of the policies and decrees of the People's Government. They said, "National affairs are the government's business and have nothing to do with us ordinary people." The masses were not interested in political activities, and it took three hours for people to gather for a meeting. There was no unity among the masses, and they rarely interacted. No one swept the streets, and it was too muddy to walk after it rained.
    In February of this year, under the call of the Guihua Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Guanyuanzi, with a Party propagandist as the backbone, mobilized fourteen neighborhood group cadres to form a reading group. At that time, the group members said, "Nine out of ten newspapers are empty talk. What's the point of listening to the news? It's just a waste of time." They treated the Party newspaper with the experience of the Kuomintang rule in a mistaken way. However, the facts gradually educated them. During the rent reduction and anti-despot movement, the newspapers continuously reflected the real situation of the anti-despot struggle in various parts of Suiyuan, especially the news of local peasants accusing the big despot Xu Fuan of his crimes, which aroused the attention of the citizens and began to realize that the Party newspaper was speaking for the people, thus increasing their interest in reading the newspaper, and the reading group began to consolidate.
    On the basis of the masses' voluntary reading of newspapers, ideological education of the masses was further strengthened and work was promoted. When the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries on a large scale began, the masses in Guanyuanzi had a sense of麻痹 [complacency], and they said, "Chiang Kai-shek is finished, and a few small special agents can't accomplish anything." After reading the newspaper, they raised their political vigilance and made them aware that everyone has the responsibility to suppress counter-revolutionaries. The group members went home to publicize to relatives and neighbors, reversed the general麻痹 [complacent] thinking, and strengthened the "duty roster" system. When a stranger came to a household, the person on duty went to that household to inquire. When the General Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea called for the promotion of patriotic pacts, the reading group took the lead in establishing patriotic pacts to ensure the successful completion of donation and preferential treatment work, and promptly organized propaganda groups to carry out door-to-door publicity. As a result, 95% of the masses in the whole neighborhood knew the simple truth about resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and more than 85% of the masses participated in the vote against the United States rearming Japan. They all signed the declaration demanding that the five major powers conclude a peace pact, and promoted the masses to establish a patriotic pact for the whole neighborhood. In order to give preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers, reading group members Liu Yuzhen and Dong Shuping braved the heavy rain to deliver water to the old man Wang Fuchen, a military family member; group members Kang Zhenjia and Han Fengqi did not ask poor military family members for rent, which greatly moved the military family members.
    The awareness of the masses has been raised, and Guanyuanzi has also changed. Under the leadership of the reading group members, the muddy roads were repaired. The phenomenon of dumping garbage was gone. Everyone had the habit of sweeping the streets and courtyards. The masses were willing to participate in political activities. Now when a meeting is called, people arrive in half an hour. The unity within the people has also been strengthened. Li Xiumei is a security officer, and because her work delayed her cooking, group member Zhao Yumei cooked for her. Li Yumei said with emotion: "In the past, under the rule of the Kuomintang, people in our yard quarreled and fought all the time, but now we have really become a family."
    The Guanyuanzi Reading Group has grown from the initial fourteen people to sixty people. They maintain close contact with the masses, often publicize the gains of reading newspapers to the masses, and at the same time reflect the ideological situation and problems of the masses to the Party newspaper, becoming a good organization for the Party newspaper to connect with the masses.

    读报组活动
    响应毛主席增产节约的伟大号召
    董林读报组订出增产节约办法
    编辑同志：我们是一个仓库的读报小组。为了响应毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议上的号召，开展增产节约运动，以支持中国人民志愿军，我们认真地学习了毛主席的开会词、陈云副总理关于经济工作和财政工作的报告及李富春同志的发言；结合我们过去节省材料、修整废品，为国家增加大笔财富的亲身体验，更深刻地体会到毛主席号召在全国范围内，开展增产节约运动的重大意义。
    半年多来，我们的读报学习从未间断过。志愿军在朝鲜作战的英雄气概，激发了我们每一个人的爱国热情。当抗美援朝总会发出增产捐献的号召后，我们小组就开始转变了过去那种单纯作收料、发料的工作态度，自动积极地清点整理了积压十多年的材料。一时用不着的，我们就上缴出去；不少陈旧生锈过去被认为是废品的东西，经过大家刷锈擦油，照样可以使用；许多废弃的铜节门，加以修整后，每公斤出售价值提高二十五倍。仅在迎接国庆节的一周中，我们小组二十四个人就突击修整了五吨废弃的瓦斯管，其价值约等于五万斤小米。
    经过这次学习，我们决心要在原有基础上提高一步，为国家节省更多的财富。我们小组除了保证完成今年冬季从修整废品中为国家增加二万五千斤小米的原计划外（现已完成百分之六十），我们还要更加妥善地保管、搬运和监督各种物资的合理使用，使库存物资不发生变质、损伤或其他意外损失。结合最近全厂的保安大检查运动，我们每一个人都开动了脑筋，订立了各种工作制度和明确的专责制度。就以防火来说，这是冬防工作的重要内容之一，对此，我们已具体地确定了临事时的各种分工和动作，并经过几次的演习。对平时的工作，也都细致地分了工，直到谁保管报纸和洗刷茶杯等等，使我们的工作可能进行得有条不紊。
    浪费材料的现象，在我们厂里也是存在的，一般的领料部门总是要多领或领好材料作一般的用途。如某部门要领瓦斯管作栏杆；某部门只需四米五钢质材料，却要领五米长的。有的虽经过我们现场检查，都被节省下来或发给代用品；但是未曾被我们发现的类似情况一定不会少。今后我们一定要与各部门加强联系，使材料能够完全合理使用，彻底纠正大材小用，整材零用，优材劣用的浪费现象，这会给国家节省很大的一笔钱！
    为国家增产和节省更多的财富，来支持志愿军，是我们每一个人心里所牢记的事情。前几天行政上要派一辆汽油卡车去搬运很少一部分物资，大家一计算，运费的成本太高，立即建议改用木炭卡车了。我们想，从这些“小处着手”，积年累日的细算一下，数目是不会太小的。
                                石景山钢铁厂董林读报组
    编者按：董林读报组是石景山钢铁厂比较好的一个读报小组。他们及时学习了中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议的文件，并结合本组的工作，研究出办法，以实际行动响应毛主席提出的“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的号召。这种做法应该向全国读报组普遍推广。各地读报组组员还应该在群众中进行广泛的宣传，反复地动员，把毛主席的号召贯彻到一切方面，使增产节约运动变成全国的群众性运动。为了交流各地读报组在这次学习中的经验，欢迎大家经常来信，报告先进的经验、方法和成绩。
    官园子是怎样转变的
    —介绍官园子读报组的活动
    归绥市二区官园子市民读报组，充分发挥了人民群众自我教育的作用，提高了群众觉悟，使这个地区完全变了样。
    官园子在成立读报组以前，群众思想很落后，对人民政府的一切政策法令都不关心。他们说：“国家大事是政府的事，与咱们老百姓无关。”群众对政治活动没有兴趣，召集一次会议，得三个小时人才能到齐。群众之间不团结，很少来往。街道谁也不打扫，一下雨泥泞得不能走路。
    今年二月，在中共归绥市委的号召下，官园子以一个党的宣传员为骨干，发动了十四个闾组干部，组成了读报组。当时，组员们说：“十报九空，听报顶啥事，白耽误时间。”他们是以国民党统治时代的经验，错误地来对待党报的。但是，事实逐渐教育了他们。在减租反恶霸运动中，报纸上不断地反映了绥远各地反恶霸斗争的真实情况，尤其是登载了当地农民控诉大恶霸徐福安的罪行消息，这就引起了市民们的重视，开始认识到党报是替老百姓说话的，提高了读报的兴趣，读报组也就开始巩固起来。
    在群众自愿读报的基础上，进一步加强了群众的思想教育，推进了工作。大张旗鼓镇压反革命运动开始时，官园子的群众是有麻痹思想的，他们说：“蒋介石已经完蛋了，几个小特务成不了气候。”经过读报，才提高了政治警惕性，使他们知道了镇压反革命是人人有责的。组员们回家就给亲戚和院邻宣传，扭转了一般人的麻痹思想，加强了“值日牌”的制度，那家来了生人，值日的就到那户去问询一下。当抗美援朝总会号召推行爱国公约时，读报组首先订立了保证作好捐献和优抚工作的爱国公约，并且及时组织了宣传组，挨门逐户地进行宣传。结果，全闾百分之九十五的群众，都知道了抗美援朝的简单道理，百分之八十五以上的群众都参加了反对美国重新武装日本的投票。他们都在要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言上签了名，并推动群众订立了全闾的爱国公约。为了优待烈属、军属，读报组组员刘玉贞、董树平冒着大雨给军属王辅臣老汉送水；组员康振家、韩凤岐不要贫苦军属给房钱，军属们非常感动。
    群众的觉悟提高了，官园子也就变了样。在读报组员的带动下，修好了泥泞不堪的道路。乱倒垃圾的现象没有了。大家都有了扫街、扫院的习惯。群众都愿参加政治活动了。现在召集会议，半个钟头人就到齐了。人民群众内部的团结也加强了。李秀梅是个治安员，因为工作误了作饭，组员赵玉梅代她作好饭。李玉梅感动地说：“过去国民党统治时，我们这个院里的人尽吵嘴打架，现在可真成了一家人。”
    官园子读报组已经由最初的十四个人发展到六十个人，他们和群众保持了密切的联系，经常把读报的收获向群众宣传，同时又把群众的思想情况和问题反映给党报，成为党报联系群众的一个很好的组织。
