　　Hunan Shaoyang Prefecture
    Failure to Seriously Implement Tax Policies During Autumn Grain Collection Leads to Uneven and Unfair Burdens on Farmers
    Editor: In the autumn grain collection work in Shaoyang Prefecture, Hunan, although patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea was conducted among farmers, the burden policy of "surveying fields to determine production and calculating taxes according to rates" was not seriously implemented, resulting in a serious phenomenon of uneven and unfair burdens. Now, there is still a considerable distance to go before the prefecture completes its collection task, but the masses of farmers are already universally complaining about the heavy burden. For example, in some areas of the prefecture, the tax rate was discarded, and the method of "self-reporting and public discussion" was adopted to mobilize farmers to "self-assess." One of the conditions for farmer Zhang Shengtang of Shaoyang County to be selected as a "model of autumn grain collection" was that he "self-assessed" public grain amounting to 30 percent of his total income. However, in Datong Township, a household that should have paid 800 jin only "self-assessed" 200 jin and got away with it. Some cadres even used the "reasoning" that "nothing can be generally equal" to "explain" this. In addition, some counties and districts, in order to complete the "task" numbers, neither carried out field surveys to determine production nor asked farmers to "self-assess," but instead formulated their own tax rates. For example, the tax rate formulated by the Eighth District of Shaoyang County was nearly doubled compared to the "Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Land Reform Areas of Central and South China in 1951" promulgated by the Central and South Military and Political Committee (which has been approved by the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council), thus arousing the dissatisfaction of the masses of farmers.
    In fact, as long as our cadres can conscientiously do a good job in surveying fields to determine production and implement "calculating taxes according to rates" (according to the tax rate promulgated by the Central and South Military and Political Committee), it is possible to implement policies and complete tasks. For example, in the "field survey to determine production" work in Xintian Township, Eighth District of Shaoyang County, cadres of the Shaoyang Prefectural Committee found another 100 mu of black land (accounting for 20 percent of the original acreage); the highest yield per mu was also increased from the originally determined 490 jin to 600 jin. This fact is a very good proof. However, the district did not do so. Some leading cadres even said: "It is hoped that all localities can formulate a usable tax rate based on the assigned public grain task and calculate taxes according to the rate." I believe that this kind of leadership thinking that disregards policies, lacks organization, and lacks discipline is an important reason for the chaos in work. In order to correctly implement the burden policy of "surveying fields to determine production and calculating taxes according to rates," Shaoyang Prefecture must thoroughly correct this erroneous thinking.

### 湖南邵阳专区  秋征中不认真执行税收政策  造成农民负担畸轻畸重现象

　　湖南邵阳专区
    秋征中不认真执行税收政策
    造成农民负担畸轻畸重现象
    编辑同志：湖南邵阳专区在秋征工作中，虽然对农民进行了抗美援朝爱国主义教育，但没有认真执行“查田定产，依率计征”的负担政策，造成了严重的畸轻畸重的现象。现在该专区离完成征收任务还有相当距离，但农民群众已普遍喊重。例如该专区的某些地区，丢开税率，采用“自报公议”的办法，发动农民“自认”，邵阳县农民张盛堂被选为“秋征模范”的条件之一，就是“自认”公粮达他总收入的百分之三十。而大同乡一户本该交八百斤，但只“自认”了二百斤也就了事。对此，某些干部还用“什么事也不能一般平”的“道理”来作“解释”。另外，还有些县、区为了完成“任务”数字，既不进行查田定产，也不叫农民“自认”，而是自订税率。如邵阳县第八区自订的税率就比中南军政委员会公布的“中南区土地改革地区一九五一年农业税暂行条例”（已经中央人民政府政务院批准）的税率提高了将近一倍，因而引起农民群众的不满。
    事实上，只要我们的干部能够认真做好查田定产工作，实行“依率计征”（依中南军政委员会公布的税率）是能够贯彻政策，完成任务的。如邵阳地委干部在检查邵阳县第八区新田乡的“查田定产”工作中，又查出黑田一百亩（占原亩数的百分之二十）；每亩最高产量也由原订四百九十斤提高到六百斤。这一事实，就是很好的证明。但该区没有这样作，甚至有个别领导干部还说：“希望各个地方都能根据分配公粮任务，自己制定一个可用的税率来依率计征。”我认为这种不顾政策、无组织无纪律的领导思想，是造成工作混乱的重要原因。为要正确贯彻“查田定产，依率计征”的负担政策，邵阳专区必须彻底纠正这种错误思想。
