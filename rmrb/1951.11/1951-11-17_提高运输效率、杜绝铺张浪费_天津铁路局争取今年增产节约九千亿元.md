　　Improve Transportation Efficiency, Eliminate Waste
    Tianjin Railway Bureau Strives for 900 Billion Yuan Increase in Production and Savings This Year
    The Tianjin Railway Bureau recently convened a joint conference of branch bureau chiefs and section chiefs from the entire railway, deciding to mobilize all employees to extensively launch a production increase and savings campaign. Building upon existing production increases and savings, the goal is to achieve a 500 billion yuan increase in production and a 400 billion yuan saving in working capital this year. The conference decided on six specific measures for increasing production and saving: (1) Strengthen transportation management and systematically launch the 500-day car-kilometer movement; (2) Strengthen basic construction management; (3) Strengthen materials management; (4) Conduct a comprehensive review of staffing levels across the railway, streamline organizations, reduce the upper levels, strengthen the lower levels, and reduce concurrent positions;
    (5) Enforce various regulations strictly, oppose extravagance and waste; (6) Enforce strict financial discipline, strengthen ideological education, and eliminate corruption. At the meeting, branch bureau chiefs also deeply examined and criticized the wasteful phenomena existing in the work of various departments, especially the serious waste in transportation capacity and basic construction projects. According to statistics from the first five days of November, the proportion of time that vehicles were stopped at stations accounted for a large percentage of the total locomotive operating hours across the bureau. The situations of single locomotives running and traction not meeting axle requirements in various branch bureaus were quite serious. In basic construction, due to a lack of foresight, designs that were not practical, and inadequate inspections during construction, some basic construction projects resulted in waste. For example, the locomotive depots in Handan, Shuoxian, and Baoding were all built but not used, wasting state funds. Lang Tao-nan, director of the Taiyuan Branch Bureau, examined the wasteful phenomena existing in the branch bureau at the meeting. First, the preparation of budgets was not practical, and more funds were requested from higher levels. The waste in basic construction was even greater. For example, when adding electrical equipment to the Linfen Power Plant, all of the purchased equipment could not be used because the purchased drawings were unclear. (Tianjin Daily)

　　提高运输效率、杜绝铺张浪费
    天津铁路局争取今年增产节约九千亿元
    天津铁路管理局最近召集了全路分局长、处长联席会议，决定动员全体职工广泛展开增产节约运动，在已有的增产节约基础上，争取今年增产五千亿元，节约流动资金四千亿元。会议决定了增产节约的六项具体措施：（一）加强运输管理，有步骤地展开五百日车公里运动；（二）加强基本建设管理；（三）加强材料管理工作；（四）全路复查定员，精简机构，紧缩上层，充实下层，减少兼职；
    （五）严格各种制度，反对铺张浪费；（六）严格财政纪律，加强思想教育，杜绝贪污。会上各分局长并深刻检讨与批评了各部门工作中所存在着的浪费现象，特别是运输力和基本建设工程中的严重浪费现象。据十一月初五天的统计，全局车辆停站时间占全部机车运转小时的比例很大；各分局单机车行走和牵引不满轴的情况相当严重。在基本建设上，由于缺乏预见性，设计不切合实际，施工期间检查又不周密，致使有些基本建设工程形成浪费，如邯郸、朔县、保定机务段车库等全部修建了却没有使用，浪费了国家的资金。太原分局郎焘南分局长在会上检讨了该分局所存在的浪费现象，首先是编造预算不切合实际，向上级多要资金，基本建设的浪费则更大，如临汾发电所增设部分电器设备时，因购置图样不清，买来后全部不能使用。（天津日报）
