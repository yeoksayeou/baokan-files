    The meeting unanimously adopted the resolutions on the various reports of the Central People's Government and the resolution on the work report of the Standing Committee. After hearing the report on the examination of proposals by Zhang Naiqi, a member of the Proposals Examination Committee, the meeting adopted the resolution on the report of the Proposals Examination Committee.
    At the meeting, Song Qingling, a member, proposed and read out a draft resolution on supporting the demand for a peace pact by the five major powers. The meeting unanimously adopted the full text of the resolution proposed by Song Qingling.

    Before the closing of the meeting, Chairman Mao made a brief speech. Chairman Mao said: "Comrades, our meeting has been successfully completed, and I congratulate the success of this meeting. Just as we are united in the great struggles internationally and domestically, our meeting is also united. Moreover, our unity is getting better year by year, more intimate year by year, and more vibrant year by year. This is completely understandable, because our people's democratic united front in China is formed step by step in the great revolutionary struggle. It is a united front of hundreds of millions of people, including all nationalities, all democratic classes, all democratic parties, all people's organizations, and all patriotic democratic people in the country. It is based on workers and peasants, it is under the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party and it also adopts the method of self-criticism. Therefore, it can be consolidated and united, it can become more and more vigorous, and more and more powerful, and it cannot be defeated by any enemy. Comrades, we have summed up the experience of the past year, stipulated the guidelines for future work, and supplemented the election of eighteen members. Let us lead the people of the whole country to continue to advance and strive for new and greater victories!" (Attached photo)

    毛主席号召继续前进争取更大的胜利
    【新华社一日讯】中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议今日下午举行最后一次大会并于六时胜利闭幕。
    在今日的大会上，全国委员会周恩来副主席作了关于各项报告讨论的总结讲话。
    会议一致通过了关于中央人民政府各项报告的决议，关于常务委员会工作报告的决议，并在听取提案审查委员会章乃器委员所作的提案审查报告后，通过了关于提案审查委员会审查提案报告的决议。
    会上，宋庆龄委员提出并宣读了关于支持五大国缔结和平公约的要求的决议草案。会议一致通过了宋庆龄委员所提出的决议全文。
    会议并一致通过了致世界和平理事会第二次会议电和复西藏地方政府电。
    会议一致通过补选全国委员会十八名委员。
    在会议闭幕前，毛主席作了简短讲话。毛主席说：“同志们，我们的会议已经胜利地完成了，我为这次会议的成功表示庆贺。如像我们在国际国内各项伟大斗争中团结一致一样，我们的会议也是团结一致的。而且我们的团结是一年比一年好，一年比一年更亲密，一年比一年更加生气勃勃。这是完全可以理解的，因为我国的人民民主统一战线是在伟大的革命斗争中一步一步地形成的，它是一个包括全国各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体以及一切爱国民主人士在内的几万万人的统一战线，它是以工人农民为基础的，它是在工人阶级和共产党领导之下的，它又是采用自我批评方法的，因此，它就能够巩固地团结一致，它就能够越来越有生气，越来越有力量，它就是任何敌人所不能战胜的。同志们，我们已经总结了过去一年的经验，规定了今后工作的方针，并且补选了十八名委员，让我们领导全国人民继续前进，争取新的更大的胜利罢！”（附图片）
