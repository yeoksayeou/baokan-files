To the Editor: After the Government Administration Council issued instructions on inspecting the implementation of the Marriage Law, another serious case occurred in Linfen County, Shanxi Province, on November 2nd, almost resulting in death due to the improper handling of a marriage case. Zhang Yonglu, a 29-year-old worker at the railway vehicle inspection depot living in Xinshi Street, Chengguan District, Linfen County, Shanxi Province, married Duan Aizhen (19 years old) last year. After the marriage, the two were not emotionally compatible and often quarreled. Zhang Yonglu had tied up and beaten Aizhen twice and obstructed her from participating in legitimate social activities. Aizhen, unable to bear it any longer, repeatedly requested a divorce from the street, district, and county governments, but was consistently blocked. It was not until October 1st this year that the county people's government approved their divorce. Zhang Yonglu, dissatisfied with the government's decision, tore up the divorce certificate. The County Civil Affairs Section then sent Zhang to the People's Court for handling. However, the court, faced with this behavior that disregarded government orders, emphasized things like "cadre status" and "the relationship between organizations," failing to punish Zhang Yonglu according to the law, and transferred Zhang to the railway vehicle inspection depot for handling. The leading cadres of the inspection depot turned a blind eye to this matter. On the morning of October 2nd, as Aizhen was about to leave to return to her hometown, Zhang Yonglu repeatedly struck her head with an axe more than a dozen times in the courtyard (there were eleven wounds). Fortunately, he was discovered, and the perpetrator Zhang was arrested and detained.

We hope that the local leading organs will seriously handle this case and examine the cadres' study and implementation of the Marriage Law. The leading cadres of the Linfen Railway Vehicle Inspection Depot should review their attitude in handling this case, study the Marriage Law carefully, and examine the education they usually provide to workers.

    临汾法院和当地铁路检车段
    不认真处理婚姻问题酿成伤人事件
    编辑同志：政务院颁布关于检查婚姻法执行情况的指示后，山西临汾县于十一月二日又发生了一件因处理婚姻案件不妥当而几乎造成人命重案的事情。住在山西省临汾县城关区辛寺街的铁路检车段工人张永禄，现年二十九岁，去年与段爱贞结婚（十九岁），婚后双方感情不合，不时发生口角。张永禄曾捆打爱贞两次，并阻碍她参加正当的社会活动。爱贞忍无可忍，几度向街、区、县政府提出离婚要求，但一直受到阻挠。直到今年十月一日，县人民政府才批准他们离婚。张永禄不满政府判决，将离婚证撕毁。县民政科遂将张送人民法院处理。但法院对这种漠视政府法令的行为，竟强调什么“干部”，什么“机关与机关的关系”等，不依法惩处张永禄，将张移送铁路检车段处理。该检车段领导干部对此事竟漠然视之。十月二日早晨，当爱贞要动身返回原籍的时候，在院中被张永禄用斧头连打头部十几下（有十一个伤口），幸被人发觉，始将张犯逮捕扣押。
    我们希望当地领导机关认真处理此一案件，并检查一下干部对婚姻法的学习及执行情况。临汾铁路检车段的领导干部，应检讨处理此案的态度，好好学习一下婚姻法，并检查一下平时对工人的教育。
