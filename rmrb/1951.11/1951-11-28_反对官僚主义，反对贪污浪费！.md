　　Oppose Bureaucracy, Oppose Corruption and Waste!
Editor's Note: The bureaucratic work style and corrupt and wasteful behavior of some cadres revealed here by our readers clearly demonstrate that these bad work styles and behaviors are seriously harming the interests of the country and should be punished by Party discipline and national law. The Party organization of the Tianjin Railway Administration must seriously handle the incident of Communist Party members Huang Yueping and Han Zhenyu politically paralyzing and suppressing criticism within the Party. The leading cadres of the Anyang branch of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company, after a spontaneous combustion accident of stored coal occurred, did not actively try to salvage the situation, but simply relied on the insurance company, waiting for the insurance company to pay compensation. This is completely not the attitude that cadres of state organs should have. The higher-level leading organs of the branch company should investigate the responsibility for the accident and give the irresponsible personnel the punishment they deserve.

　　Tianjin Railway Administration Huang Yueping and Han Zhenyu
　　Political Paralysis and Suppression of Party Member Criticism
　　The Bureau Should Seriously Deal With It
　　Huang Yueping, Director of the Education Department of the Tianjin Railway Administration, and Communist Party member, and Han Zhenyu, Chief of the Education Section of the Department, and Communist Party member, have a purely professional viewpoint, which has led to political paralysis and a failure to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves. They appointed a person with reactionary behavior as the principal of the Railway Workers' Children's Middle School and were unwilling to listen to the opinions of the masses. Although the local Party committee repeatedly raised opinions, Huang Yueping and Han Zhenyu ignored them. Li Yaochun, the former principal of the Changxindian Railway Workers' Children's Middle School, was from a landlord family and had served as the secretary of the Kuomintang Baoding City Party Department. After the Japanese surrender, he served as a Kuomintang "Party and Government Column Commissioner" in Beijing. After the liberation of Beijing, he slandered the People's Government and the people's leaders, spread anti-Soviet and anti-communist remarks, and prevented students from carrying out anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda. Han Zhenyu turned a blind eye to these reactionary behaviors of Li Yaochun and always trusted him to be the principal. For this reason, the Changxindian General Branch of the Communist Party of China raised opinions to Han Zhenyu, but Han still used the excuse that "no one can fill the vacancy after dismissal, which will affect business" and did not accept the opinions. It was not until the Tianjin Railway Administration Party Committee of the Communist Party of China raised opinions that Han dragged on the matter for a long time before reluctantly dismissing Li Yaochun. In addition, the masses also raised many opinions about the school's teachers, asking the Education Department to consider handling them. Our Fengtai District Party Committee also suggested to Huang and Han that they should handle the opinions of the masses carefully. Huang and Han said: "The masses have opinions on some teachers because the unity work is not done well. We should strengthen unity in the future." The opinions of the masses became more and more numerous. Finally, under our repeated suggestions and urges, Huang and Han went to the Changxindian Railway Workers' Children's Middle School at the beginning of this month to handle this issue, taking advantage of the opening of the cultural class. After arriving at Changxindian, Huang and Han only criticized the Party members at the Party meeting, sympathized with and shielded backward elements. They even lost their temper at the Party members who made suggestions. This kind of behavior of suppressing democracy cannot be tolerated by Party discipline. We suggest that the Tianjin Railway Administration seriously deal with the bureaucratic work style of Huang and Han in politically paralyzing and suppressing democracy, and publish the results of the handling in the newspaper.

　　Anyang Coal Construction Branch Company Cadres Irresponsible
　　A Spontaneous Combustion Accident of Stored Coal Occurred
　　Loss of Assets Eighty Million
　　Comrades Editors: The Anyang branch of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company in North China suffered a spontaneous combustion accident of stored coal in August of this year, resulting in a loss of state assets of approximately 80 million yuan. On the afternoon of August 13, smoke began to billow from the coal pile on the west side of the Gaozhuang Business Office, which belongs to the Anyang branch. After being discovered, workers were immediately called to rescue the situation, and personnel from the insurance company were brought in to check the accident. After research, it was determined that the spontaneous combustion was caused by the excessive temperature of the coal. Immediately, mud was used to block the smoking areas, and trenches were dug in the coal pile to separate the unburned parts. With the efforts of more than 300 people, including local Party and government personnel and the masses, the burning coal pile was completely extinguished by the afternoon of the 17th. At the same time, the Anyang Railway Station coal yard also experienced a spontaneous combustion accident due to excessive coal accumulation.
　　The occurrence of the above-mentioned accident was due to the imbalance in transportation, excessive coal accumulation, and the lack of sufficient understanding of the dangers of spontaneous combustion of bituminous coal by management cadres. The ideological paralysis of the company's leadership was also an important cause of the accident. For example, the company's leading cadres were unprepared for this incident and did not actively try to salvage the situation after the accident occurred, but simply relied on the insurance company. They thought that the materials had been insured and someone would compensate for the losses, but they completely ignored their own responsibilities. This is an irresponsible manifestation of national property. Article 72 of the "Provisional Regulations on Warehousing Management of State-owned Trading Institutions" stipulated: "After warehouses and materials are insured, employees must not be paralyzed and dependent on insurance. If a disaster occurs, responsibility should still be investigated." This is worth our vigilance. I hope that all comrades in the warehousing management department will treat our storage tasks with a high sense of responsibility, reduce and eliminate all accidents, and avoid the loss of state assets.

　　Bureaucratic Leadership Cadres of Fengfeng Mining Bureau Hospital
　　Resulted in Collective Embezzlement Incidents such as Zhang Zhiqing
　　An illegal incident of collective embezzlement of drugs by medical personnel occurred in the Fengfeng Mining Bureau Hospital. In August of this year, the mine announced the implementation of the "Labor Insurance Regulations" regarding the "self-care of expensive drugs." Doctors Zhang Zhiqing, Lin Hui, Lu Songfeng, and nurses Zhao Jingyi, Wang Yunli, Wang Jinjing, Zhang Xinghao, and others believed that there was an opportunity to take advantage of this, so they carried out collective embezzlement. They stole ten ampoules of ovarian hormone, eleven ampoules of progesterone, eight ampoules of testosterone, five ampoules of glucose calcium, and progestogens, cod liver oil, etc., worth a total of 381,000 yuan. The main reason for the occurrence of this incident is inseparable from the bureaucratic work style of the hospital's leading cadres. In the past, incidents of unexplained loss of valuable drugs had also occurred in the hospital, but the leading cadres did not take it seriously, and approved the reimbursement without principle. Therefore, this collective embezzlement incident was caused. We hope that the mine will seriously deal with this incident and publish the results of the handling in the newspaper.

　　Jin Shouwu, District Committee of Shanxi Postal and Telecommunications Trade Union
　　Misappropriation of Public Funds, Embezzlement in Disguise, Should Be Punished
　　Jin Shouwu, Director of the Labor Protection Section of the District Committee of the Shanxi Postal and Telecommunications Trade Union, has misappropriated public funds and embezzled in disguise on several occasions. 1. Last year, in the twelfth lunar month, the District Committee of the Trade Union advanced a batch of public funds to help the Taiyuan postal and telecommunications workers overcome difficulties during the New Year, and entrusted Jin Shouwu to buy pork for the workers. Now most of the workers have successively paid the money to Jin Shouwu, but Jin Shouwu used the excuse that the workers had not paid all the money, misappropriated more than 500,000 yuan from it for his own expenses, and did not give it to the public. 2. Yan Shuihuai, an employee of the Taiyuan Telecommunications Command Bureau, was approved to go to Beijing for medical treatment in August. When he went to the bureau to collect the labor insurance money for June and July, it was found that Jin Shouwu had collected it on his behalf. At this time, Jin went to Taigu to inspect the work. After a phone inquiry, Jin declared that he had collected it on his behalf and had spent it. Jin Shouwu has not yet paid the money. 3. In August, when Jin Shouwu went to the countryside to inspect the work, he borrowed one million yuan by privately stamping the name of the chairman of the trade union without the approval of the leader. In addition to the 160,000 yuan in travel expenses that should be reimbursed, the remaining 800,000 yuan has not been returned. The above incidents have passed for a long time, but the leadership has not given the deserved education and punishment, I think this should not be.

　　Deputy County Heads of Tuoketuo County, Suiyuan Province
　　Embezzlement of Huge Sums of Money Has Been Dismissed and Brought to Justice
　　Wang Zhida, the county head of Tuoketuo County, Suiyuan Province, Wang Shusen, the deputy county head, Wu Shanli, the director of the Yongji Canal Office of the Shaanba Special Office Water Conservancy Bureau, and others, disregarded national laws and disciplines, embezzled and derelicted their duties, and have been dismissed and brought to justice.
　　Wang Zhida, the county head of Tuoketuo County, had a serious embezzlement when he took over from the previous county head, Li Linzhao, in October 1949. Afterwards, he continued to embezzle more than 7,000 jin of wheat for office expenses of grain and food issued by the provincial people's government, and instructed Zhang Shaozhou and other staff members of the county people's government to forge account books, inflate repair expenses, winter coal expenses, worker clothing expenses, and police quota, and embezzled more than 200 Sui stones (one Sui stone is equivalent to two market stones) of millet and more than 140 market stones of wheat. In addition, he also embezzled more than 600 sheepskins handed over to the station. From January to March 1950, he privately deducted more than 20 million yuan from the salaries of employees and embezzled more than 900 silver dollars for horse feed. After successive investigations, Wang Zhida embezzled a total value equivalent to 140,900 jin of millet. Wang Shusen, the deputy county head, and Zhang Shaozhou and more than a dozen other people also colluded with Wang to commit embezzlement, with a total value equivalent to more than 17,000 jin of millet.
　　Wu Shanli, director of the Yongji Canal Office of the Shaanba Special Office Water Conservancy Bureau, previously served as a lieutenant instructor of the Kuomintang reactionary army, a major regimental instructor, and the director of the Gengnong Farm of the puppet army, and the director of the Puppet Yongji Canal Administration. He has always been engaged in private fraud. After the liberation of Suiyuan, Wu committed the crime of serving as the director of the Yongji Canal Office. Not only did he not bow his head and repent for his past sins, but he also continued to steal national assets. He embezzled 195 stones of millet four times by reporting less and more in the purchase of engineering timber. He embezzled 117 stones of millet four times by falsely reporting and falsely reporting expenses. He embezzled 168 stones of millet four times under the pretext of repairing dikes. In addition, he privately ate empty quotas and hid materials, embezzling more than 310 stones of millet. Wu committed the crime of embezzling more than 790 stones of millet after liberation.
　　The above-mentioned criminals have been dismissed and brought to justice by the people's government.

　　反对官僚主义，反对贪污浪费！
    编者按：本报读者在这里所揭发的一些干部的官僚主义作风和贪污浪费行为，都明显地说明了这些坏作风和坏行为是严重地损害了国家的利益，都应该受到党纪和国法的制裁。天津铁路管理局党的组织必须严肃处理共产党员黄悦平、韩震宇政治麻痹压制党内批评的事件。中国煤业建筑器材公司安阳支公司的领导干部，在发生存煤自燃事故后，竟不积极设法挽救，单纯依赖保险公司，等着保险公司赔偿，这完全不是国家机关干部所应有的态度。该支公司的上级领导机关应该追查事故责任，给不负责任的人员以应得的惩处。
    天津铁路管理局黄悦平韩震宇
    政治麻痹并压制党员批评该局
    应该认真予以处理
    天津铁路管理局教育处处长、共产党员黄悦平和该处教育科科长、共产党员韩震宇有单纯业务观点，以致政治上麻痹，敌我不分，任用有反动行为的人为铁路职工子弟中学校长，并不愿听取群众意见。当地党委虽曾一再提出意见，黄悦平、韩震宇却置之不理。前长辛店铁路职工子弟中学校长李耀春，本系地主出身，曾任国民党保定市党部书记。日寇投降后，又在北京任国民党“党政纵队专员”。北京解放后，曾诬蔑人民政府和人民领袖，散布反苏反共言论，阻止学生进行抗美援朝的宣传，韩震宇对李耀春这些反动行为却不闻不问，一直信任其当校长。为此中共长辛店总支向韩震宇提出了意见，韩仍借口“撤职后无人补缺，影响业务”而不接受意见。直至中共天津铁路管理局党委提出了意见，韩仍将此事拖延很久，才勉强将李耀春开除。此外群众也对学校教员提出了很多意见，要教育处考虑处理。我们丰台地区党委亦向黄、韩二人建议，应慎重处理群众的意见。黄、韩二人却说：“群众对某些教员有意见，是团结工作做的不好，今后应当加强团结。”群众意见愈来愈多，最后在我们多次建议和督促下，黄、韩才于本月初借文化班开学的机会，去长辛店铁路职工子弟中学处理这一问题。到达长辛店后，黄、韩在党的会议上一味指责党员，同情和包庇落后分子。甚至对提意见的党员声色俱厉地发了一顿脾气。这种压制民主的作风是党纪所不能容许的。我们建议天津铁路管理局对黄、韩政治麻痹，压制民主的官僚主义作风作认真处理，并将处理结果在报上公布。

    安阳煤建支公司干部不负责任
    发生存煤自燃事故
    损失资财八千余万
    编辑同志：中国煤业建筑器材公司华北区安阳支公司，于本年八月间曾发生存煤自燃事故，损失国家资财约八千余万元。八月十三日下午，安阳支公司所属高庄营业处西面的煤堆向外冒烟，经发觉后，当即号召工人抢救，并一面找来保险公司工作人员查看事故情况。经过研究后，认为是因煤炭温度过高而引起的自燃。随即用泥土堵塞各冒烟处，并将煤堆扒沟，隔开未燃部分。在当地党、政工作人员和群众等三百多人努力抢救下，至十七日下午燃着的煤堆始完全被熄灭。与此同时，安阳车站煤厂亦因积煤过多，发生自燃事故。
    以上事故的发生，除因调运不平衡，积煤过多，和管理干部对烟煤自燃的危险缺乏充分认识外，该公司领导上思想麻痹也是造成这一事故的重要原因。如该公司的领导干部对此事事先既无准备，事故发生后也没有积极设法挽救，单纯地依赖保险公司。他们以为物资已经保险了，损失了有人赔偿；而却完全忽略了自己应负的责任。这是一种对国家财产不负责任的表现。在《国营贸易机构仓储管理暂行条例》第七十二条中曾有过规定：“仓库及物资保险后，员工不得因保险发生麻痹依赖思想，如发生灾害，仍应追查责任”，这是值得引起我们警惕的。我希望每个仓储管理部门的同志都以高度负责的精神对待我们的保管任务，减少和消灭一切事故，避免国家资财的损失。

    峰峰矿务局医院领导干部官僚主义
    造成张智清等集体贪污事件
    峰峰矿务局医院发生医务人员集体贪污药品的不法事件。今年八月间，该矿宣布实行《劳动保险条例》中关于“贵重药品自理”的规定，该医院医生张智清、林辉、芦松峰和护士赵静仪、王韵莉、王锦英、张兴皓等十二人，认为有机可乘，遂进行集体贪污。计盗窃公家药品卵巢荷尔蒙十支、黄体素十一支、盖世雄八支、葡萄糖钙五支及助孕素、鱼肝油等，总值三十八万一千元。这一事件发生的主要原因，是和该医院领导干部的官僚主义作风分不开的。该院过去也曾发生过无故遗失贵重药品的事件，但领导干部并未认真处理，而无原则地批准报销。因此又造成了这次集体贪污的事件。我们希望该矿认真地处理这一事件，并将处理结果在报上公布。

    山西邮电工会区委会靳守武
    挪用公款变相贪污应受处分
    山西邮电工会区委会劳保科长靳守武，先后挪用公款变相贪污。一、去年旧历腊月间，工会区委会为了照顾太原邮电职工过年困难，垫出一批公款托靳守武给职工代买猪肉。现在大部职工已陆续将款交付靳守武，但靳守武却借口职工未给完款，从中挪用五十余万元自己花费，不给公家。二、太原电信指挥局职工阎水怀于八月间批准赴京养病，当他到局领取六、七月份劳保金时，经查已由靳守武代领了。这时靳到太谷去检查工作，经电话询问，靳才声明自己代领，并已花用。靳守武现仍未将此款交付。三、八月间靳守武下乡检查工作时，未经领导批准即私自加盖工会主席名章开借条借了一百万元，除应报销十六万元路费外，其余八十余万元亦未归还。以上事件已过很久，但领导方面仍未给予应得的教育与处分，我觉得这是不应该的。
