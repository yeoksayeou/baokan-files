The All-China Federation of Trade Unions convened a National Conference on Work with Families of Workers and Staff on October 10th in Beijing, to strengthen work with the families of workers and staff. Li Lisan, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, emphasized in his concluding remarks: Trade union organizations must clearly understand that work with families is an important component of trade union work. Trade union organizations at all levels, especially grassroots trade union organizations, must study and implement methods and steps for conducting work with families, based on the specific conditions of local factories and mines. Leadership over work with families must be strengthened.

Significant achievements have been made in work with the families of workers and staff over the past year. More than 1.6 million industrial workers' families living in concentrated areas across the country have been organized, an increase of 570% compared to last year. Statistics from just seven provinces, twenty-three cities, and seven mining areas show that a total of 2,151 family committees and 13,787 family groups have been established. 29,392 family cadres above the group leader level have emerged. In Northeast China, Kailuan, Tianjin, Qingdao, Wuhan, Chongqing, Shanghai, and other places, 81 training classes have been held, training 5,463 active family members.

Around the "March 8th" International Women's Day and "May 1st" Labor Day this year, workers' families were universally educated in patriotic anti-Americanism and aid-Korea, and their political awareness rapidly improved. According to statistics from sixteen large and medium-sized cities, 200,992 family members participated in the "May 1st" demonstrations. According to materials from three provinces, two cities, the Northeast Railway System, and the East China Coal Mine System, a total of 532,261 people participated in peace signatures and voting against the United States' arming of Japan, accounting for 90% of the total number of families in these areas. According to incomplete materials from eighteen cities and four mining areas, families donated a total of 500,259,3254 yuan, 273 pieces of gold jewelry, 4,906 silver yuan, 387 pieces of silver jewelry, and more than 16,800 catties of scrap iron before September.

Organized family masses universally established patriotic pacts. In Heilongjiang Province, 80% of workers' families established patriotic pacts; in Beijing, the figure was 89%; and in Shenyang, it was 77%. The patriotic pacts of workers' families are formulated in conjunction with the central work of factories and mines. These patriotic pacts encourage workers' enthusiasm for production, improve household management, organize mutual assistance, solve difficult problems with their own strength, and reduce the burden on workers, playing a significant role. For example, thanks to the guarantees of family members, the attendance rate of workers in the Shenyang Railway and Tram Company reached 99% during the Spring Festival this year, which played a major role in completing the production tasks for the first quarter. Thanks to the mutual assistance of family members in the Xi'an Coal Mine in Northeast China, 773 families' difficulties in taking care of childbirth and illness have been resolved over the past year, reducing "absences from work" by 2,319, which is equivalent to increasing coal production by more than 3,400 tons for the mine. More than 280,000 families across the country actively participated in various sideline productions.

Organized families in various places enthusiastically completed their tasks in supporting the front lines. In Wuhan, 3,000 families made 30,000 cotton-padded coats in half a month; in Jilin City, more than 3,000 families led women throughout the city to complete the task of military bedding, receiving more than 1,000 letters of thanks from the troops in eight days. Family members' patriotic enthusiasm is even more evident in enthusiastically sending their sons and husbands to the front lines. For example, the wife of worker Wu Xianzhi from the Jiang'an Railway Factory said: "My husband was trained by the country and should be given to the motherland." Li Shouchong's mother personally went to the trade union to request approval for her son to go to Korea to directly support the Volunteer Army.

Workers' families have also played a role in democratic nation-building. Many active family members have served as group leaders or village heads in grassroots political power, or have been elected as people's representatives. In the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries and carry out democratic reforms, families recognized the faces of the enemy and actively participated in accusing, exposing, and secretly reporting counter-revolutionaries. In factories and mines where work with families is more advanced, families have organized picket teams and patrol teams to take turns on guard duty.

Due to the improvement of political awareness, family masses are actively seeking to learn culture. According to extremely incomplete statistics, 100,149 families living in concentrated areas across the country have participated in cultural learning, with more than 1,600 literacy classes and 1,292 bedside literacy groups. In industries with faster production development, many educated active family members have already taken up social professional positions. For example, in the Northeast Railway, more than 1,000 family members have participated in railway construction over the past year; in the Tianjin People's Bank, more than 660 family members have been employed this year.

The conference focused on exchanging typical experiences from various regions. Tian Yuren, chairman of the trade union of the Shanghai Clothing Factory No. 1, is the most successful example of a grassroots trade union committee leading work with families. He said: In the past, the factory workshops were noisy all day long. From April to June of last year alone, there were more than 700 absentees in the entire factory. Special agents, hooligans, and landlords were active in the workers' dormitories, and there were nineteen fires in two months. The chaotic situation in the workshops seriously affected the workers' morale for production, and the trade union work could not be carried out. Later, the person in charge of the factory Party committee called on Party and Youth League members to actively educate their families at Party and Youth League branch meetings. The chairman of the trade union also personally started working with families. Based on the families' demands for engaging in sideline production and learning culture, the families were organized. In the process of learning and engaging in sideline production, the families themselves proposed to guarantee that workers would not be absent from work and would be at ease in production. A clean and sanitary competition was launched in the workshops, and the family masses themselves organized picket teams to patrol the workshops, changing the chaotic situation of the past. The family masses assisted the factory in completing the sudden task of military bedding several times.

Tian Yuren said: The main reason why the family work of Clothing Factory No. 1 can be carried out is the Party's attention and leadership, and the administrative support also played a positive role. He said that from the trade union's point of view, the first is to clarify that family work is an important part of trade union work. The trade union includes family work in every work plan it makes. The chairman of the trade union often takes some time to personally check and help the work of the family committee. When the committee assigns work, it also assigns family work to the workshop committees, mobilizing all workers to cooperate and help family work.

A typical report from Beijing pointed out that when a certain power plant adjusted wages, the Party committee attached importance to family work and explained the wage policy to the families. The families took the initiative to help the trade union reflect the workers' thoughts and dispel the ideological concerns of some workers, so that the wage adjustment could be carried out smoothly. The above experience shows that in order to complete the central task of each factory and mine, it is necessary to carry out work among the families at the same time. It also shows that family work cannot be done in isolation, but must be combined with the central tasks of the factories and mines in order to gain the attention and support of all parties.

Based on the situations in various places and the work experience of the past year, the conference determined that the guiding principles and tasks for the work of workers' and staff members' families in the future are: to continue to consolidate and expand the organization of families, to strengthen patriotic education for families, to promote unity and mutual assistance, diligence and hygiene among families, to improve the family life and living environment of workers and staff members, to cooperate with the factory's increase production and practice economy movement, and to ensure that workers and staff members complete their production tasks. The specific methods are: first, to promote and revise patriotic pacts among families; to publicize and implement various policies and decrees of the People's Government, especially policies and decrees related to the vital interests of women. It is necessary to carry out the publicity and education of the Marriage Law among both male and female workers and their families. Organize mutual assistance to solve the difficulties of the family masses, and at the same time, carry out literacy campaigns and health education among the families, and absorb the family masses to participate in various cultural and political activities of the trade union.

　　中华全国总工会召开全国职工家属工作会议
    决定加强职工家属工作
    中华全国总工会为加强职工家属工作，于十月十日在北京召开了全国工人、职员家属工作会议。中华全国总工会副主席李立三在作结论时着重指出：工会组织必须明确家属工作是工会工作的重要组成部分，各级工会组织，尤其是工会基层组织，都要根据本地厂矿情况，研究进行家属工作的办法和步骤。加强对家属工作的领导。
    一年来职工家属工作是有显著成绩的。全国集中居住的产业职工家属，已有一百六十多万人组织起来，比去年增加了百分之五百七十。仅七个省，二十三个市和七个矿区的统计：共建立了二千一百五十一个家属委员会，一万三千七百八十七个家属小组；涌现了二万九千三百九十二个小组长以上的家属干部。在东北、开滦、天津、青岛、武汉、重庆、上海等地，举办了八十一期训练班，训练了五千四百六十三名家属积极分子。
    在今年“三八”妇女节和“五一”劳动节前后，职工家属普遍受到抗美援朝爱国主义的教育，政治觉悟迅速提高，据十六个大、中城市的统计，有二十万零九千九百二十二名家属参加了“五一”示威游行；据三个省、二个市和东北铁路系统、华东煤矿系统的材料，共有五十三万二千二百六十一人参加和平签名和投票反对美国武装日本，占这些地区家属总数百分之九十；另据十八个市，四个矿区不完全的材料，在九月以前，家属共捐献五亿零二百五十九万三千二百五十四元，金首饰二百七十三件，银元四千九百零六元，银首饰三百八十七件，废铁一万六千八百多斤。
    有组织的家属群众，普遍订立了爱国公约。黑龙江省职工家属订爱国公约者达百分之八十；北京市达百分之八十九；沈阳市达百分之七十七。职工家属的爱国公约，是结合着厂矿的中心工作制定的。这些爱国公约，鼓励职工生产热情，搞好家务，组织互助，以自己的力量解决困难问题，减轻职工负担，起了很大的作用。如沈阳铁路和电车公司的职工，由于家属的保证，在今年春节中，出勤率达到百分之九十九，对完成第一季度生产任务，起了重大作用；东北西安煤矿由于家属的互助，一年来解决了七百七十三户家属生育、疾病乏人照顾的困难，减少工友二千三百十九个“歇勤”，也就是说，等于为矿山增产三千四百多吨煤。全国有二十八万多家属，积极参加了各种副业生产。
    各地有组织的家属，在支援前线工作上，热烈完成了任务。武汉三千家属在半个月内，作了三万件棉大衣；吉林市三千多家属，带动全市妇女，完成了军需被服任务，八天内收到部队感谢信一千多封。家属爱国热情更表现在热烈送子送丈夫上前线。如江岸铁路工厂工友吴先志的妻子说：“我丈夫是国家培养起来的，应该把他交给祖国。”李守忠的母亲，亲自到工会，要求批准他的儿子到朝鲜，直接支援志愿军。
    职工家属在民主建政上也起了作用，有许多家属积极分子担任了基层政权的居民小组长、村长，或被选为人民代表。在镇压反革命和民主改革运动中，家属认清了敌人面目，踊跃参加了控诉、检举、密告反革命分子。在家属工作较先进的厂矿中，家属组织了纠察队、巡查队，轮流站岗放哨。
    由于政治觉悟的提高，家属群众积极要求学文化，据极不完全的统计，全国有十万零一百四十九名集中居住的家属参加了文化学习，有一千六百多个识字班和一千二百九十二个炕头识字小组。在生产发展较快的产业，不少有文化的家属积极分子已经走上了社会职业岗位，如东北铁路，一年来有一千多个家属参加铁路建设；天津人民银行，在今年已有六百六十多家属就业。
    会议着重交流了各地区典型经验。上海被服一厂工会主席田余仁，是工会基层委员会领导家属工作最有成绩的典型。他说：过去该厂工房整天吵闹不停，仅去年四月到六月，全厂有七百多个旷工；工人宿舍里有特务、流氓、地主活动；二个月内失火十九次。工房里的混乱情况，严重地影响了工人的生产情绪。工会工作也无法开展。后来，工厂党委的负责人，在党、青年团的支部大会上，号召党员、团员，积极教育自己的家属；工会主席也亲自动手进行家属工作。根据家属要搞副业生产和学习文化的要求，把家属组织起来。在学习和从事副业生产的过程中，家属们自己提出，保证工友不旷工，安心生产；并在工房开展了清洁卫生竞赛，家属群众自己组织了纠察队，巡视工房，改变了过去的混乱现象。家属群众数次协助工厂，完成了军需被服的突击任务。
    田余仁说：被服一厂家属工作能够开展的主要原因是党的重视与领导，行政的支持也起了积极的作用。他说，从工会方面来说，首先是明确了家属工作是工会工作的重要部分，工会每次订工作计划，都把家属工作订在里边；工会主席经常抽出一部分时间来亲自检查、帮助家属委员会工作，委员会布置工作时，也把家属工作布置到车间委员会，动员全体职工，配合帮助家属工作。
    北京的典型报告中指出：某发电厂调整工资时，党委重视家属工作，向家属讲解了工资政策，家属就主动地帮助工会反映职工思想情况，解除某些职工思想顾虑，使调整工资得以顺利进行。以上的经验说明：要完成每个厂矿的中心任务，必须同时在家属中进行工作，也说明了家属工作不能孤立去做，必须结合厂矿的中心任务，才能得到各方面的重视与支持。
    会议根据各地情况和一年来的工作经验，确定今后工人、职员家属工作方针任务是：继续巩固与扩大家属的组织，对家属加强爱国主义教育，提倡家属间的团结互助，勤劳卫生，改进工人、职员的家庭生活和居住环境，配合工厂增产节约运动，保证工人、职员完成生产任务。具体做法是：首先在家属中推广与修订爱国公约；宣传和贯彻人民政府各种政策法令，特别是有关妇女切身利益的政策法令。要在男女职工和家属中，同时进行婚姻法的宣传教育。组织互助，解决家属群众的困难，同时要在家属中开展识字运动和卫生教育，吸收家属群众参加工会各种文化、政治活动。
