Xinhua News Agency, Vienna: The World Peace Council continued its meeting on the afternoon of the 5th, according to TASS. The first to speak was Lissaridhis, Chairman of the Cyprus Peace Committee. He reported on the imperialists' efforts to turn Cyprus into a war base and emphasized that the Cypriot people are waging a tireless struggle to oppose these sinister plots and defend peace.

The German writer Becher spoke about the aggressive policies of the United States in West Germany. He said that West Germany is being turned into an arsenal and springboard for the American imperialists to attack the Soviet Union and the people's democracies. Becher called for strengthening the movement to defend peace and strive for German unification.

Following him, the representatives of the Yugoslav people, Popiwoda, and the Secretary-General of the Liaison Committee of International Peace Organizations, Paul Du (Switzerland), spoke.

Nicholson, a member of the British Labour Party, an active trade union leader, and former Mayor of Hull, spoke on behalf of the masses of British trade union members—machine manufacturing workers and armaments factory workers. He said that our responsibility is to prove to the workers that peaceful construction will provide them with jobs and to expose the evil consequences of the arms expansion movement.

Attendees listened with great attention to the speech by World Peace Council member Fafardo (Italy). He reported on the development of the signature campaign in Italy demanding that the five major powers conclude a peace pact. He urged the meeting to formulate concrete measures to strengthen the struggle to defend world peace.

The Iraqi representative Jawad described in his speech how the Iraqi people are fighting against the imperialists who plunder Iraqi oil. He emphasized that the Iraqi people support the Iranian and Egyptian people who have risen up to fight for national independence.

The Chairman of the Guatemalan Peace Committee and writer Luis Cardoza pointed out that South American countries are constantly subjected to direct and indirect interference. Recently, the United States has interfered in the affairs of Latin American countries more severely than ever before. The thirty conspiracies to overthrow the government that have occurred in the six years since the founding of the Republic of Guatemala were all instigated by the United States government. He emphasized that defending peace means defending our national sovereignty, independence, and survival.

The next speaker was Hanna, a member of the World Peace Council and a representative of Lebanon. He talked about the conspiracy of the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and Turkey to enslave the people of the Middle East through the so-called Mediterranean Pact. Hanna said that the people of the Near East are determined to do everything possible to resist any pact that may endanger their independence, freedom, and peace.

The Sudanese representative Suleiman emphasized in his speech that the main task of Sudanese peace fighters is to turn the Sudanese peace movement into a mass movement and to link this movement with the struggle of the Egyptian and Sudanese people to liberate themselves from imperialist oppression. He emphasized: "We will never agree to let American imperialism replace British imperialism. Our task is to drive all imperialists out of the Nile River Basin!" These words earned the audience enthusiastic applause.

Representatives from Syria, Tunisia, Norway, and Israel also spoke at the afternoon meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Vienna: The evening session of the World Peace Council on the 5th was presided over by World Peace Council Executive Bureau member and Lebanese representative Taber. Laborer, a Belgian trade union worker, spoke at the meeting, describing the development of the signature campaign in Belgium in support of the five major powers concluding a peace pact.

World Peace Council member and representative of the Union of South Africa, Burke, emphasized in his speech that the progressive and peace-loving people of all races and nationalities in the Union of South Africa have become increasingly united in the struggle against the implementation of the war plans of American and British imperialism. People from Europe, Indians, and Bantu blacks have united to fight for peace.

Iranian representative Eskandari described in his speech the Iranian people's selfless struggle to resist the Anglo-American aggressors' seizure of Iranian oil and other wealth. He said that the most important factor at present is the awakening of the Iranian people, who have realized that the struggle for national independence and the struggle to defend peace are closely linked. The achievements of the signature campaign in Iran in support of the Stockholm Declaration and the World Peace Council Declaration show that the Iranian people's awareness has been raised in the struggle for national independence. They have made contributions to the struggle for peace. Eskandari finally thanked the Soviet government and people on behalf of all the Iranian people for the Soviet representative's maintenance of Iran's sovereignty and independence in the United Nations Security Council. He also thanked the government of the Republic of Poland for the sincere and fair position taken by the Polish representative in the International Court of Justice in The Hague.

The next speaker was World Peace Council member Dubrizburg (Austria). He emphasized that American war peddlers are trying to politically and economically enslave Austria. Austria is becoming a country that supplies cheap raw materials to the war industry in Western Europe.

Former Colombian Congressman Professor Vives spoke on behalf of Colombian peace fighters. After emphasizing that the various peoples of Latin America have consistently advocated peace and the peaceful coexistence of all countries, he put forward two proposals to the meeting: to immediately convene a peace conference of all American countries; to protest the arbitrary act of the Colombian court in sentencing Colombian lawyer Huelva to three years in prison for attending the Berlin World Youth and Student Peace Festival, and to express solidarity and support to Huelva.

Attendees applauded the speech by Le Dinh Tham, the representative of the Vietnamese people who are waging an armed struggle against the French colonialists and American interventionists. He denounced the brutal crimes of the French army against the Vietnamese people and the assistance given by the American aggressors to the French imperialists in the colonial war. He said that despite all these conspiracies of the imperialists, the Vietnamese people are still fighting heroically for their independence and are fully convinced that they will achieve final victory.

Finally, the Argentine representative Aquiar talked about the Argentine people's struggle to defend peace and oppose American imperialism's enslavement of Argentina. She said that the Argentine people are actively demanding an end to American aggression in Korea.

Xinhua News Agency, Vienna: The World Peace Council continued its meeting on the morning of the 6th, chaired by World Peace Council member Hromadka (Czechoslovakia). World Peace Council member and German representative Walter Dirr spoke first. He described the situation of young people in West Germany and cited facts to prove how the Bonn "government" colludes with the American and British occupation authorities in an attempt to use material difficulties and unemployment to force German youth to join the re-establishing Wehrmacht.

The next speaker was Professor Horak (Czechoslovakia), Professor of Theology at Bratislava University. He emphasized that millions of Catholics are participating in the struggle against the war peddlers. On behalf of Czechoslovak Catholics, Horak urged Catholics around the world to participate in the great peace movement.

Tini (France), Secretary-General of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, emphasized the need for all youth organizations worldwide to strengthen unity. He said that if we unite as one, the aggressors will not be able to complete their sinister plans.

The meeting listened with great attention to the speech by the American representative Kingsbury. He described in detail the atmosphere of fear and war hysteria currently prevailing in the United States. Kingsbury told the meeting about his trip to the Soviet Union. He said that he and his companions did not see any signs of a "reign of terror" in the Soviet Union. He said: "We saw everywhere in the Soviet Union that ardent desire to maintain world peace." In conclusion, Kingsbury again urged all peace fighters in the world to do their utmost to demand that the major powers negotiate on the issue of strengthening world peace.

Also speaking at the meeting were World Peace Council member Ehrenburg (Soviet Union), Romanian representative Sadoveanu, the famous Egyptian peace fighter Kamel El Bindari, People's Republic of China representative Mao Dun, and Cuban representative Quirin.

In his speech, Chinese representative Mao Dun emphasized the importance of cultural relations between countries for defending peace. He described the great work his country has done to familiarize its people with world literature masterpieces, especially the literature of the people of the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and other countries. In conclusion, Mao Dun suggested commemorating the anniversary of the death of the great French writer Hugo, who fought for a better future for mankind.

After the speech by Cuban representative Quirin, the morning session was adjourned.
