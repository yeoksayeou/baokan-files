In carrying out the campaign for increased production and thrift, organizations and groups should pay special attention to exposing various phenomena of extravagance, waste, embezzlement, and corruption, and consciously carry out democratic inspection work to fight against all phenomena of not cherishing the property of the motherland and the people, embezzlement and waste, and bureaucratic work styles. This kind of inspection is an indispensable and important step in carrying out the campaign for increased production and thrift. For this purpose, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee held a meeting of party member cadres and introduced to all party member cadres in the organs the specific facts of embezzlement and waste and their harm to the people, and called on everyone to conduct extensive criticism and self-criticism. This approach is completely necessary. Some cadres in individual organs feel that it seems that increasing production and practicing thrift has nothing to do with their organs. In fact, these comrades have not realized the great significance of increasing production and practicing thrift. After mobilization and education, democratic inspection, exposure, and criticism, these comrades can suddenly realize, "It turns out that there are still many places where we can save." If everyone consciously pays attention to correcting all possible waste phenomena in daily life and vigilantly protects the property of the motherland and the people, then the realization of the plan for increased production and thrift will have a guarantee of victory.

    不可缺少的重要步骤
    开展增产节约运动中，机关团体要特别注意揭发各种铺张浪费贪污腐化的现象，有意识地进行民主检查的工作，同一切不爱护祖国人民财产、贪污浪费现象和官僚主义作风进行斗争。这种检查是开展增产节约运动必不可少的重要步骤。河北省委为此目的召开党员干部大会，向机关全体党员干部介绍了贪污浪费的具体事实及其对人民的损害，号召大家进行广泛的批评和自我批评，这一作法是完全必要的。有个别机关的干部觉得似乎增产节约与本机关无关，实际上是这些同志没有认识到增产节约的伟大意义，经过动员教育，民主检查，揭发和批判等工作，这些同志就可以恍然大悟，“原来可以节约的地方还多”，每一个人自觉地在日常生活中注意纠正一切可能的浪费的现象，警惕地保卫着祖国人民财产，那么，实现增产节约计划就有了胜利的保证。
