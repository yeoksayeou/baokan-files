    Defend the Great Motherland, Strive for a Better Future
    Lin Wei
    The North China Regional Urban-Rural Material Exchange Exhibition is not just a simple meeting for exchanging materials; through rich and instructive exhibits and organized off-site seminars, get-togethers, factory and farm visits, and other activities, it has become a place for practical education for urban and rural people. It plays a significant role in consolidating the unity of urban and rural people, strengthening the worker-peasant alliance, and reinforcing patriotic and communist future ideological education.
    "Chairman Mao leads so well!"
    Before coming to Tianjin, many farmer representatives were still worried about being taken advantage of, based on their past experiences of villagers going to the city. However, when they got off the train, they saw a scene of gongs and drums, with citizens lining the streets to welcome them, and the sound of firecrackers and cheers blending together. Their doubts immediately vanished, and they responded to the welcoming crowd with enthusiastic applause and cheers. The citizens offered them beautiful rooms, set up beds, and spread beautiful bedding for the farmers to live in. When the farmers wanted to go out to find friends, buy things, or go to the hospital for treatment, the landlords' children and women would automatically lead the way. A farmer representative from Baoding District suffered from gastroenteritis, and his landlord, Mao Yuhong, who was a doctor, automatically provided medicine to cure him. Chai Zongyan, a farmer representative from Shanxi, got lost near Quanye Market and forgot his address. A tricycle worker, Liu Zhongxuan, automatically pulled him around for three hours, helping him find his lodging. All of this made the farmer representatives strongly feel that "the city has changed," "the relationship between city dwellers and villagers has changed," and "the world has truly become the people's." In their chats and gatherings, they talked everywhere about this new feeling and impression, speaking very excitedly. An old farmer from Pingshun County, Shanxi, sixty-three years old, constantly praised "Chairman Mao leads so well!" whenever he talked about this change. Later, he bought a portrait of Chairman Mao embedded in a gold-plated frame for 170,000 yuan and took it home.
    Workers and Peasants are One Family
    Workers and peasants held urban-rural get-togethers or seminars everywhere. Everyone could not be satisfied with fixed meeting formats, and naturally gathered together in groups of three or five to confide in each other, unwilling to leave. When recounting the tragic lives of being exploited and oppressed by imperialism, bureaucratic compradors, and feudal landlords in the past, everyone shed tears together; when talking about the situation of the anti-traitor, anti-despot, land reform, and suppression of counter-revolutionaries movements and the life after liberation, everyone laughed and thanked Chairman Mao and the Communist Party together. When talking about the production achievements of their respective factories and rural areas, and how to strive for increased production in the future, everyone sincerely put forward various hopes and suggestions. Chen Shengliang, a farmer representative from Pingshun County, Shanxi, participated in a seminar and said after returning, "In the past, the superiors said that workers and peasants were like brothers, one family, but I always felt that they were not connected; this time, they are truly connected."
    Worker-Peasant Alliance and Working-Class Leadership
    According to comrades from the Shanxi farmer delegation, before coming to Tianjin for a visit, many farmer representatives did not quite understand why our new China must implement the worker-peasant alliance and why it must be led by the working class. They verbally agreed with this principle, but in reality, they couldn't quite figure it out. They said, "This time we have to take a good look in Tianjin and see how the workers are actually leading the peasants."
    After visiting the exhibition and factories and farms, the farmers affectionately called the workers "elder brothers" and sincerely talked about how the working class "is more advanced than the peasants." They said that the working class has a broad political vision and a long revolutionary history; they are organized in production, have strong collectivity, and are also creative. At the same time, they talked about how the workers made this and that for the peasants. Now the most common opinion is: "Without the worker elder brothers, no matter how capable we are, we would only use wooden plows and wooden harrows, and good cattle and donkeys, and work all day, plowing three or five mu. The worker elder brothers made tractors for us, without livestock, it's hundreds of mu a day. We can't even dream of it!" "We use a windlass to irrigate the land, irrigating two or three mu a day, and with a waterwheel, it's only about ten mu. The water pumps made by the worker elder brothers can irrigate more than a hundred mu a day, how much labor is saved!" "A rural woman spins four liang of thread a day, and a good hand spins no more than half a jin, a worker can watch four or five hundred spindles and spin one or two hundred jin a day. One person is worth hundreds of us." Similar discussions are countless. In short, everyone truly recognized that workers are capable and that the working class is the most advanced class.
    "How do you say the working class leads us?" A female representative from Pingshun County named Chen Liunv asked herself. Then she answered herself: "They don't run to the countryside to give us orders. But they manufacture advanced agricultural tools for us to use, production is improved, society evolves, and everyone enjoys happiness, isn't that leading us?" Guo Quande from Shanxi used an analogy saying: "Our peasants' past production was like turning a millstone. Turning for generations is still such a big circle, never moving forward. Now the workers form an alliance with us, leading us forward, it's really different every year. In the past, there was no way to deal with pests, but now there is. In the past, we only knew how to cut wormwood and compost manure, but now there is bone fertilizer. Last year there was only a new-style plow, but this year we saw tractors and diesel engines. In the past, many machines had to be bought from abroad, but now we can make them ourselves. I don't know what more ingenious machines will be made next year!"
    No longer satisfied with the life of "thirty mu
    of land and an ox"!
    Having seen the prospects of machine production, the farmer representatives were no longer satisfied with
    the life of "thirty mu of land and an ox, plows, harrows, hoes, and rakes." They developed a strong interest in socialism and communism. After seeing tractors and other agricultural machinery and learning about the situation of Soviet collective farms, many people said: "It would be great if we could be like this someday." Chen Shengliang, an old man from Pingshun County, said with great interest: "In the past, I thought socialism and communism were good, but I was afraid they couldn't be realized. Now, I understand. With the worker-peasant alliance and the workers taking the lead, socialism and communism will definitely be realized."
    When talking about growing more cotton and other cash crops, many people could only think of how the income from one mu of cotton was equivalent to several mu of millet, and the income from one mu of kenaf was equivalent to several mu of corn; now they say: "We must produce more industrial raw materials to supply factories, break the imperialist blockade, and let the worker elder brothers develop industry well, so that communism can be realized sooner." In many meetings and chats, the opinion "whatever the factory needs, we will produce it, and sell everything we produce to the country" can be heard. Zhang Zuodi from Linfen County, Shanxi, said: "Tractors are good, but one family can't use a tractor!. Take my village, for example, there are only sixty or so households, ten or so hectares of land, I don't think it's enough for one tractor to do." Chen Liunv said after visiting the factory: "Workers can use machines because the workers are organized. Hundreds or thousands of people are together, you do this, he does that, and only manage what they do. If a person focuses on one job, the more they do, the more skilled they become, and the more new methods they have. If we want to use machines, we must learn to do this, and organize ourselves first."
    Defend Our Great Motherland
    The farmer representatives saw the infinitely rich resources in the exhibition, saw the rapid progress in all aspects of construction, and saw the beautiful prospects of machine production and communism, and naturally thought that we must strengthen the worker-peasant alliance and defend our great motherland. In the past, the farmers said: "The Communist Party led me to turn over, and I have land and houses, I want to defend this good life." Now they say: "Our workers and peasants form an alliance, and unite well with other classes to build the country better" (words of a farmer representative from Pingshun). "We must defeat the American aggression and protect our motherland. I will go back and be a propagandist and promote Resist America, Aid Korea, and the worker-peasant alliance." (National Labor Model Zeng Guangfu). When visiting the disaster overcoming hall and seeing the glorious history of the people of Pingyuan Province overcoming the Yellow River water disaster and the achievements of the People's Government in governing the Yellow River, as well as the schematic model of the Yellow River's future prospects, Yang Jiadong, the water management model from Suiyuan Province, said to his companion: "Our motherland is too great, we must protect it well! After we go back, we will produce well; whatever the motherland needs us to do, we will do it." Li Jingcai, a military family labor model from Yuncheng County, Shanxi, felt that he was old in the past and often missed his son who was far away in Korea. After visiting the exhibition, he immediately wrote a letter to his son saying: "Our motherland is truly great, and the resources are truly abundant. The worker elder brothers have created many new agricultural tools, pesticides, and machines, which will all be used by us in the future. Now I ask you to eliminate more American devils on the battlefield and be a hero in killing the enemy, protecting our country and the country's property. I hope you break the concept of family and always think about defending the motherland, defending the people, striving for world peace, and striving for a happier life in the future!"
    After the visit, the farmers' horizons were broadened, and their thinking advanced. They now further saw their country clearly and loved their country even more.

    保卫伟大的祖国，争取美好的将来

    华北区城乡物资交流展览会，不只是一个简单的交流物资的会；它通过丰富而有指导意义的展览品和有组织的会外座谈、联欢、参观工厂、农场等各种活动，成为对城乡人民进行实地教育的场所。在巩固城乡人民团结、巩固工农联盟、加强爱国主义思想教育和共产主义前途教育上，都起着很大的作用。
    “毛主席领导得真好！”
    许多农民代表没有来到天津以前，还是根据过去乡下人进城的老经验，耽心被别人“捉老憨”。但是，他们一下火车，看到的是锣鼓喧天，市民夹道欢迎，鞭炮声和欢呼声响成一片。他们疑虑顿消，也用热烈的鼓掌和欢呼回答欢迎的人群。市民们让出漂亮的房间，摆了床，铺上漂亮的被褥，给农民住。农民要出去找朋友、买东西或到医院治病，房东的孩子和妇女们就自动带路。保定区一个农民代表患胃肠炎，他的房东毛羽鸿是个医生，自动拿出药品给他治好了。山西农民代表柴宗炎在劝业场附近迷了路，而且忘记了住址。三轮车工人刘中选自动拉着他跑了三个钟头，帮助他找到住处。这一切，都使农民代表强烈地感觉到“城市变了”，“城里人和乡里人的关系变了”，“世界真正成了人民的了”。他们在闲谈的时候，集会的时候，到处讲他们这种新的感觉和印象，讲得非常激动。山西平顺县一个六十三岁的老农，一谈到这种变化，就不断地赞叹“毛主席领导得真好！”后来他用十七万元买了一幅嵌着镀金框子的毛主席像，带回家去了。
    工人农民一家人
    工人和农民到处开工农联欢会或座谈会。大家不能满足于固定的会议形式，自然而然地三个五个围在一起，互相谈心，不愿离去。在倾诉过去受帝国主义、官僚买办和封建地主的剥削压榨的悲惨生活时，大家一同掉眼泪；谈到反汉奸、反恶霸、土地改革、镇压反革命等运动的情况和翻身以后的生活时，大家同声欢笑，同声感谢毛主席、共产党。谈到各人的工厂和农村的生产成绩，谈到今后如何努力增产时，大家诚恳地提出各种希望与建议。山西平顺县农民代表陈生亮参加一次座谈会，回来后说：“以前上级说工人农民是兄弟俩，一家人，我心里老是觉得连不在一起；这回可真正连在一起了。”
    工农联盟和工人阶级领导
    据山西农民代表团同志说，在没有来天津参观以前，许多农民代表是不大了解我们新中国为什么必须实行工农联盟和为什么必须由工人阶级来领导的。他们口头上同意这种道理，实际想不很通。他们说：“这回到天津可得好好看看，看工人究竟怎样领导农民。”
    参观了展览会和工厂、农场以后，农民亲昵地称呼工人为“老大哥”，心悦诚服地谈论着工人阶级“就是比农民先进”，他们说工人阶级政治上眼光远大，革命历史长；生产上有组织，集体性强，创造性也强。他们同时谈论着工人给农民造了这个，造了那个。现在最普遍的舆论是：“要没有工人老大哥，咱们再有本事，也不过使个木犁木耙，使个好牛好驴，累上一天，犁上三亩五亩。工人老大哥们给咱造了拖拉机，不用牲口，一天就是几百亩。咱们做梦也梦不到啊！”“咱们用辘轳浇地，一天浇二、三亩，用水车浇，也不过十来亩。工人老大哥造的抽水泵，一天能浇一百多亩，该省多少工啊！”“一个农村妇女一天纺四两线，好把式也不过半斤，一个工人看上四、五百锭子，一天能纺一、二百斤。一个人顶咱好几百人。”类似的谈论，不胜枚举。总之，大家都真正承认了工人有本事，工人阶级是最先进的阶级。
    “你说工人阶级怎样领导我们呢？”平顺县一个名叫陈六女的女代表自己发问。然后她又自己回答：“他们并不跑到乡下给我们下命令。可是他们制造出进步的农具来给我们使用，生产提高了，社会进化了，大家都享福，这不就领导了我们啦？”山西的郭全德打了个比喻说：“咱们农民过去的生产，就像是转磨道。转上几朝几代也是这么大个圈圈，永远前进不了。现在工人和咱结成联盟，领着咱往前走，真是一年一个样子。以前害虫没办法，现在有办法了。以前咱只会割蒿沤粪，现在有骨肥了。去年还只有新式步犁，今年就看到拖拉机、柴油机了。从前好多机器都得从外国买，现在自己能造了。明年还不知道又造出什么更巧妙的机器呢！”
    不再满足于“三十亩地
    一头牛”的生活了！
    看见了机器生产的远景，农民代表们不再满足于
    “三十亩地一头牛，犁耧钁耙样样有”的生活了。他们对社会主义和共产主义发生了浓厚的兴趣。许多人看了拖拉机等农业机械，晓得了苏联集体农庄的情形以后说：“咱们几时也能这样就好啦。”平顺县的陈生亮老汉兴致勃勃地说：“从前我觉得社会主义和共产主义好是好，就怕不能实现。现在，我明白了。有了工农联盟，有了工人带头，社会主义和共产主义一定会实现的。”
    谈到多种棉花和其他经济作物时，许多人以前只能想到一亩棉花的收入顶几亩谷子，一亩洋麻的收入顶几亩玉米；现在他们说：“要多多生产工业原料，供给工厂，打破帝国主义的封锁，叫工人老大哥好好发展工业，共产主义就能早点实现。”在许多会议上和闲谈中都可以听到“工厂需要什么，我们就生产什么，生产出来都卖给国家”的舆论。山西临汾县的张作弟说：“拖拉机是好，可是一家不能用一个拖拉机呀！。就说俺那一个村吧，合起来也不过六十多家，十来顷地，我看就不够一架拖拉机干的。”陈六女在参观了工厂以后说：“工人们能够使用机器，是因为工人有组织。几百人几千人合在一起，你干这，他干那，干什么的光管什么。一个人专心干一件工作，越干越熟，新办法也越多。咱们要想使用机器，也得学这样子，先组织起来。”
    保卫我们伟大的祖国
    农民代表在展览会中看到无限丰富的物产，看到各方面建设的飞跃进步，看到机器生产和共产主义的美丽前途，很自然地想到必须加强工农联盟，必须保卫我们伟大的祖国。从前农民们说：“共产党领导我翻了身，有了土地房屋，我要保卫我这好光景。”现在他们说：“咱们工人农民结成联盟，再团结好别的阶级，把国家建设得更好些。”（平顺农民代表语）。“我们必须打破美国的侵略，保住咱们祖国。我回去要当个宣传员，好好宣传抗美援朝，工农联盟。”（全国劳动模范曾广福）。在战胜灾害馆里参观平原省人民战胜黄河水患的光荣史迹和人民政府治黄的成就以及黄河远景示意模型时，绥远省的治水模范杨加东对他的同伴说：“我们祖国太伟大了，可得好好保卫啊！回去以后，我们好好生产；祖国需要我们作什么，我们就作什么。”山西运城县的军属劳动模范李景才，过去觉得自己年纪老了，时常想念他远在朝鲜的儿子。参观了展览会以后，马上亲笔写了一封信给他儿子说：“咱们祖国真是伟大，物产真是丰富。工人老大哥创造了许多新式农具农药和机器，将来都要给咱们使用。现在我要求你在战场上一定要多多消灭美国鬼子，当个杀敌英雄，保住咱们的国家和国家的财产。希望你打破家庭观念，时时刻刻想着保卫祖国，保卫人民，争取世界和平，争取将来过更幸福的日子！”
    经过参观，农民们的眼界展开了，思想前进了。他们现在进一步看清了自己的国家，更加热爱自己的国家了。
