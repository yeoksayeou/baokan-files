Workers at Huangguantun Railway Factory
    Study Soviet Experiences to Improve Production

    The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association of the Huangguantun Railway Factory in Shenyang actively assists the factory's Communist Party organization, administration, and trade union in mobilizing workers to study advanced Soviet experiences, which has improved the factory's production and increased the workers' love for the Soviet Union.

    In order to improve production, the factory's Communist Party organization and administration decided to mobilize workers to study advanced Soviet production experiences. It was decided to first implement the Kovalev method in the mechanical branch factory to gain experience and promote it throughout the factory. After this decision was conveyed to the mechanical branch factory, some workers believed that learning the Kovalev method required a high level of education and rich work experience, which ordinary workers did not have; some workers said, "I have worked for half my life and have never seen a machine transformed," "A machine is dead, it can only rotate a hundred revolutions, how can it be transformed to rotate a hundred and twenty revolutions." In response to these ideological situations, the factory's Sino-Soviet Friendship Association introduced Kovalev's work method to everyone on the blackboard bulletin; introduced the Soviet "Construction" magazine to the workers; and held discussion meetings to encourage workers to develop a spirit of innovation. At the same time, they decided to start with the Chu Hongyi group first. Chu Hongyi is a member of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and after accepting this task, he actively united all the members of the group, starting with improving various specific tasks. The负责人 (responsible person) of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the trade union 负责人 (responsible person) personally helped him with research. They discovered and solved the main problems existing in production at that time, brought the potential of the machine into play, and improved work operations, which resulted in a 200% increase in production.

    After the success of the Chu Hongyi group's experiment, the factory's Sino-Soviet Friendship Association immediately cooperated with the Communist Party organization, administration, and trade union to vigorously promote it, turning the successful experience of the Chu Hongyi group in learning the Kovalev method into comic strips, compiling them into clappers and doggerels, publishing them on 180 blackboard bulletins and picture posters throughout the factory, broadcasting them on the radio, and inviting Chu Hongyi to make a report to the workers of the factory. The Chu Hongyi group also launched challenges to various groups throughout the factory. In this way, the movement to learn advanced Soviet experiences quickly spread throughout the factory.

    After this movement was launched, the factory's Sino-Soviet Friendship Association collected information, summarized experiences, and solved difficulties at any time, and new production records emerged continuously as a result. The rivet workshop learned the Soviet two-shift competition system, and the task completion rate increased from failing to complete the task every month in the past to completing the task seven days ahead of schedule. The Cai Zhongsheng group worked hard to learn advanced Soviet experiences, and the production rate in September increased by 35% compared to August. The workers praised each other and said, "We have learned advanced Soviet experiences, which has increased the wealth of the country, and this is the glory of our entire factory. In the future, we must continue to work hard to learn."

    In the process of learning advanced Soviet production experiences, the workers of the factory improved their understanding and love for the Soviet Union, and as a result, they asked to join the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association one after another. Now, the number of members of the factory's Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has increased from 700 in August of last year to 2,900. (Xinhua News Agency)

    皇姑屯铁路工厂工人
    学习苏联经验提高生产
    沈阳皇姑屯铁路工厂的中苏友好协会积极地协助该厂共产党组织、行政和工会，发动工人学习苏联的先进经验，提高了该厂的生产，增进了该厂工人对苏联的热爱。
    该厂的共产党组织和行政方面为了提高生产，决定发动工人学习苏联的先进生产经验，并决定先在机械分厂试行郭瓦廖夫工作法，以便取得经验，推广全厂。这个决定传到机械分厂后，有些工人认为学习郭瓦廖夫工作法需要很高的文化程度和丰富的工作经验，普通工人是不行的；有些工人说：“我干了半辈子也没有看见改造过机器”，“机器是死的，它只能转一百转，怎样改造也转不了一百二十转”。针对这些思想情况，该厂的中苏友好协会便在黑板报上向大家介绍了郭瓦廖夫的工作方法；把苏联“建设”杂志介绍给工人们看；并召开座谈会，鼓励工人发扬创造精神。同时他们决定先从初鸿义小组开始。初鸿义是中苏友好协会会员，他接受了这个任务以后，便积极地团结全组组员，从改进各种具体工作做起。中苏友好协会的负责人和工会负责人都亲自帮助他研究。他们发现和解决了当时生产上存在的主要问题，发挥了机器的潜在力，改进了工作操作法，结果使生产提高了百分之二百。
    初鸿义小组的试验成功以后，该厂的中苏友好协会立刻配合共产党组织、行政和工会，大力进行宣传，把初鸿义小组学习郭瓦廖夫工作法成功的经过画成连环画，编成快板、顺口溜，在全厂一百八十块黑板报和画报上刊载，在广播台上广播，并请初鸿义向全厂工人作报告。初鸿义小组又向全厂各组发起了挑战。这样，学习苏联先进经验的运动就迅速地普及全厂。
    在这个运动发动起来以后，该厂的中苏友好协会就随时汇集情况，总结经验，解决困难，新的生产纪录因此不断涌现。铆工分厂学习了苏联的两班竞赛制，由过去每月完不成任务提高到提前七天完成任务。蔡忠生小组努力学习苏联先进经验，九月份的生产率比八月份提高了百分之三十五。工人们互相赞美说：“我们学会了苏联先进经验，就替国家增加了财富，这是我们全厂的光荣。今后我们要继续努力学习。”
    该厂工人在学习苏联的先进生产经验中，提高了对于苏联的认识和热爱，因而纷纷要求加入中苏友好协会。现在该厂的中苏友好协会会员已从去年八月的七百人增加到二千九百人。（新华社）
