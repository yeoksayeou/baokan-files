    To Marshal Stalin:
    On the occasion of the 34th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, we extend our sincere and warm congratulations and our highest respects to you and the Soviet people. The great and glorious achievements of the October Revolution have brought a beautiful and happy socialist system to the world. In the strong and great Patriotic War, in the prosperous construction of marching towards communism, and in leading the people of the world in the movement against aggression and in defense of peace, the Soviet people have fully proved that the theory of Marxism-Leninism is a universal truth, and that the Soviet socialist social system has incomparable superiority.
    Due to the influence of the success of the Soviet October Revolution, and the long-term enthusiastic encouragement and support of the Soviet government and the Soviet people, the Chinese people have achieved a great victory in the people's democratic revolution. In the past year, we have been fighting alongside the Korean people against the aggression of American imperialism, giving the aggressors a serious blow, and forcing them to accept peaceful proposals and stop the war of aggression. All of us in China are unanimously following the "lean to one side" policy of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, and are forever learning from the Soviet Union's advanced construction experience and creative spirit with unparalleled excitement and joy, in order to build our great motherland, and together with the people of the world, march towards the great future of socialism and communism.
    We respectfully wish that the friendship between the two great allied nations of China and the Soviet Union will be consolidated and developed day by day, and that the great, strong, and invincible power of the Chinese and Soviet people will be victorious forever!
    Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang

    中国国民党革命委员会贺电斯大林大元帅：
    欣逢伟大的十月社会主义革命三十四周年纪念，我们谨向您及苏联人民致诚挚热烈的祝贺和崇高的敬礼。十月革命伟大的辉煌的成就，已给世界人类带来了一个美好的幸福的社会主义制度。苏联人民在坚强伟大的卫国战争中，在走向共产主义的繁荣昌盛的建设事业中，在领导全世界人民反对侵略保卫和平的运动中，已充分证明了马克思列宁主义的理论是普遍真理，苏联社会主义社会制度具有无比的优越性。
    中国人民由于苏联十月革命成功的影响，由于苏联政府和苏联人民长期的热情的鼓舞和支援，业已取得了人民民主革命的伟大胜利。这一年来我们正与朝鲜人民为了反对美帝国主义的侵略并肩作战，给了侵略者以严重的打击，要迫使它接受和平的建议，停止侵略的战争。我们全中国人民都一致遵照中国伟大的人民领袖毛泽东主席“一边倒”的政策，永远以无比兴奋和愉快的心情，学习苏联先进的建设经验和创造精神，来进行建设我们伟大的祖国，并和全世界人民共同走向社会主义共产主义远大前途。
    敬祝中苏两大盟邦的友谊日益巩固与发展，中苏两国人民伟大坚强不可战胜的力量胜利万岁！
    中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深
