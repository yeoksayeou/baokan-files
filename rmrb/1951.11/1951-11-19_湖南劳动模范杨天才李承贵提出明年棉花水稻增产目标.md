Hunan Labor Models Yang Tiancai and Li Chenggui
Propose Cotton and Rice Production Increase Targets for Next Year

　　Yang Tiancai and Li Chenggui, well-known agricultural labor models in Hunan Province, proposed their targets for increasing the unit area yield of cotton and rice next year at the Hunan Provincial Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference. Yang Tiancai's goal is to strive for a yield of 1,000 catties of seed cotton per mu, and Li Chenggui's goal is to strive for a yield of 1,500 catties of rice per mu.
　　Yang Tiancai just returned to Changsha from Beijing. He conveyed Qu Yaoli's cotton planting experience at the meeting, saying: "Qu Yaoli's experience is: choose good seeds, sow early, use sufficient fertilizer, and prune well. We do as he does, and there is no problem with increasing production. This year's cotton in Lixian County, those planted early yielded 300 catties per mu, while those planted late only yielded more than 100 catties. When I go back, I will mobilize everyone to plant cotton before the beginning of summer and lead everyone to select cotton seeds by grain."
　　Li Chenggui is a model of high rice yield in Hunan Province. He uses a lot of fertilizer for farming and is willing to put in hard work. This year, he harvested 1,350 catties of rice per mu. He said: "Next year, pay more attention to deep plowing and meticulous cultivation and pest control, and it will not be difficult to harvest 1,500 catties." Cheng Mingnan, a labor model from Yintian Township, Xiangtan County, challenged Li Chenggui and will also strive to harvest 1,500 catties of rice per mu next year. Long Dage, a labor model of the Miao ethnic group in western Hunan, wants to promote the digging of 1,000 wells in the whole township. Liao Renfu, a model mutual aid team leader in the suburbs of Hengyang City, wants to promote the organization of all the farmers around him. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

　　湖南劳动模范杨天才李承贵
    提出明年棉花水稻增产目标
    湖南省的著名农业劳动模范杨天才和李承贵，在这次湖南省召开的农业劳动模范代表大会上，提出了他们明年提高棉花和水稻单位面积产量的目标。杨天才的目标是争取每亩棉田收籽棉一千斤，李承贵的目标是争取每亩稻子收一千五百斤。
    杨天才刚从北京回到长沙。他在会上传达曲耀离种棉花的经验说：“曲耀离的经验就是：选种好，下种早，肥料足，整枝好。我们照他的样做，增产没有问题。我们澧县今年的棉花，种得早的每亩收三百来斤，种得迟的就只收了一百多斤。我回去要发动大家在立夏以前种棉，带动大家粒选棉籽。”
    李承贵是湖南全省水稻丰产的模范。他种田施肥多，肯下工夫，今年每亩稻收一千三百五十斤。他说：“明年多注意深耕细作和除虫，收一千五百斤没困难。”湘潭县银田乡劳动模范成命南向李承贵应战，明年也要争取每亩稻收一千五百斤。湘西苗族劳动模范龙大哥要推动全乡打一千眼水井。衡阳市郊的模范互助组长廖仁福要推动他周围的农民都组织起来。　（据新华社讯）
