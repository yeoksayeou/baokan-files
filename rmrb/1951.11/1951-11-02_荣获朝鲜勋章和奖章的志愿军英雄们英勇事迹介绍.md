Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 31st – The seventeen combat heroes and people's meritorious servants of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who were awarded medals and orders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea this time include military commanders, combatants, engineers, telephone operators, political workers, office staff, and automobile drivers. They fought bravely and worked actively in their respective combat positions, establishing glorious achievements for the just cause of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, safeguarding our homes and defending our country.

	Deputy Platoon Leader Ping Taixin, who was awarded the Third-Class National Flag Order, is a combat hero known for his bravery in battle. In a battle during the Second Campaign, he detoured behind the enemy alone, first destroying two enemy jeeps, and then climbed onto a tank and destroyed three more armored vehicles with grenades. Taking advantage of the enemy's confusion, he fired fiercely, killing or wounding more than 30 enemy soldiers. He also destroyed a bridge with hand grenades, blocking the enemy's escape route. When our follow-up troops arrived, he killed, wounded, and captured seventeen more enemies. Because he cut off the enemy's escape route, the follow-up troops seized 37 vehicles, three armored vehicles, two tanks, and eight howitzers in the battle.

	Deputy Political Instructor Sun Yongchang, who was awarded the Second-Class Warrior Honor Medal, demonstrated the excellent qualities of a political worker during the year of war. During the Fourth Campaign, despite his weakened condition after an illness, he participated in the battle to defend Height 350.3. He became so exhausted on the position that he fainted, but when he woke up, he immediately continued to encourage and direct the troops to fight, and even when he was wounded, he did not stop performing his combat tasks. In this battle, he commanded the troops to repel seven enemy assaults in a row, killing and wounding a large number of enemies. He also displayed a high degree of class friendship, distributing more than 280 catties of dry food to neighboring troops in the difficult situation of food shortages. Because of his continuous and powerful political work among the troops and the influence of his own exemplary actions, the Third Company he was in at the time had become a glorious heroic company.

	Automobile Driver Dong Yanda, who was awarded the Second-Class Warrior Honor Medal, created a brilliant record of 23,470 kilometers of safe driving. He has not rested for a single day since he began working in battlefield transportation last year. He overfulfilled his task by more than 100 percent in August.

	Engineer Squad Leader Chang Deshan, who was awarded the Second-Class Warrior Honor Medal, is a model engineer commander. When he was rushing to repair a bridge last winter, he took the lead in breaking open the thick ice and repaired the bridge piers with his feet immersed in the cold, biting water. On another occasion, it rained continuously for several days, and a large number of vehicles and howitzers were blocked on a certain section of the highway, but he worked hard to find a solution and finally enabled all the vehicles and howitzers to drive out of the muddy section.

	Office Staff Member Zhao Yuanbi, who was awarded the Military Service Medal, is a model technical work cadre unanimously praised by everyone. In the case of few people and many tasks, he often held three jobs concurrently and completed his work tasks satisfactorily.

　　荣获朝鲜勋章和奖章的志愿军英雄们英勇事迹介绍
    【新华社朝鲜前线三十一日电】此次荣膺朝鲜民主主义人民共和国勋章和奖章的十七位中国人民志愿军的战斗英雄和人民功臣，其中包括军事指挥员、战斗员、工兵、电话员、政治工作人员、机关工作人员和汽车驾驶员等。他们站在各个不同的战斗岗位上英勇奋斗，积极工作，为抗美援朝保家卫国的正义事业创立了光获的功绩。
    荣获三级国旗勋章的副排长平太信是以勇敢作战著称的一位战斗英雄。在第二次战役的一次战斗中，他单独迂回到敌人背后，首先击毁两辆敌吉普车，接着爬到坦克旁边，用手榴弹又炸毁了三辆装甲车。他趁着敌人混乱之际猛烈射击，杀伤敌人三十余名。他并用手雷将桥梁炸毁，堵住了敌人的逃路。当我军后续部队赶到时，他又杀伤和俘掳了十七个敌人。由于他截断了敌人的逃路，使后续部队在战斗中缴获了三十七辆汽车、三辆装甲车、两辆坦克和八门榴弹炮。
    荣获二级战士荣誉勋章的副政治教导员孙永昌，在一年的战争中表现了政治工作人员的优秀品质。第四次战役时，他不顾病后身体较弱，参加了坚守三五零点三高地的战斗。他在阵地上疲劳得竟至昏迷过去，但是当他苏醒之后，马上又继续鼓励和指挥部队作战，即使在他负伤的时候，他也不停止执行自己的战斗任务。在这次战斗中，他指挥部队连续打退敌人的七次冲锋，杀伤了大量敌人。他并且发扬了高度的阶级友爱精神，在缺乏粮食的困难情况下，将二百八十多斤干粮分给友邻部队。由于他向部队不断地进行强有力的政治工作和他本身模范行动的影响，他当时所在的第三连已成为光荣的英雄连队。
    荣获二级战士荣誉勋章的汽车驾驶员董晏达，曾创造了安全行车二万三千四百七十公里的光辉纪录。他自去年参加战地运输工作以来从未休息过一天。他在八月份内超额完成了一倍以上的任务。
    荣获二级战士荣誉勋章的工兵分队长常德山，是个模范工兵指挥员。去年冬天抢修某处桥梁时，他带头敲开厚冰，两脚浸在寒冷刺骨的水中修理桥墩。另一次有数天连日下雨，某段公路上堵塞了大批汽车和榴弹炮，但他努力想出办法，终于使全部车辆和榴弹炮驶出了泥泞地段。
    荣获军功章的机关工作人员赵元璧，是大家一致赞扬的模范技术工作干部。他在人少工作繁多的情况下，经常兼任三种工作，并且圆满地完成工作任务。
