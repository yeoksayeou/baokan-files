    To Marshal Stalin:
    On the occasion of the thirty-fourth anniversary of the great Socialist October Revolution, we, all comrades of the China Zhi Gong Party, extend to you and the people of the Soviet Union our most sublime respect and warmest congratulations!
    We congratulate you on the success of the socialist construction in the Soviet Union under your leadership. This success is a strong guarantee for the cause of world peace. The Chinese people will certainly learn from the experience of the Soviet Union's October Revolution, build their own country, and unite with the Soviet people to fight for the complete smashing of the aggression schemes of American imperialism and its accomplices, and for the great cause of lasting world peace!
    Long live the friendship and solidarity between China and the Soviet Union!
