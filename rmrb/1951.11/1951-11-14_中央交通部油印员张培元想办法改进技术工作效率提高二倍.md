To the Editor: Zhang Peiyuan, a mimeograph operator at the Central People's Government's Ministry of Communications, has recently improved his mimeograph techniques, thereby doubling his work efficiency. Since the Ministry of Communications launched the production increase and donation campaign, Zhang Peiyuan has been thinking every day about how to overcome the difficulties of limited material conditions and improve his skills on the existing basis. So he started to check his work. He found that the spring of the mimeograph machine was too active, and a slight movement would cause the gauze basket to oscillate for a long time, and it would take time to grab it by hand. He disassembled the mimeograph machine and modified it with a shorter spring. After each impression, the basket would bounce to about 45 degrees high, so it wouldn't oscillate all the time. In addition, in order to prevent the unused ink from forming a skin, he poured some number four oil on the surface of the ink, thus overcoming the problem of ink skinning. Due to these technical improvements, Zhang Peiyuan used to print 300 sheets per hour, and 500 to 600 sheets during rush work; now he can regularly print 800 to 900 sheets per hour, and more than 1,000 sheets during rush work. Once, he printed 500 copies of urgent documents in 20 minutes.

　　中央交通部油印员张培元
    想办法改进技术工作效率提高二倍
    编辑同志：中央人民政府交通部油印员张培元，最近改进了油印技术，因而使工作效率提高二倍。自交通部开展增产捐献运动后，张培元就每天想，如何克服物质条件限制的困难，从现有基础上来提高技术。于是他就开始检查工作。他发现油印机的弹簧太活动，动一下子就会使纱布筐动荡很久，手去抓它又耽搁时间。他把油印机拆卸下来，改装了较短的弹簧，以后印一下，筐子就弹到四十五度那样高，不会老动荡了。此外，为了使用不完的油墨不起皮起见，他就在油墨面上倒了些四号油，这样就克服了油墨起皮的毛病。由于这些技术上的改进，张培元以前每小时印三百张，突击工作时印五六百张；如今每小时经常印八百至九百张，突击起来可以印一千多张，有一次，他在二十分钟内印出了五百份的急件。　           林振宗
