　　(Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, Delayed Dispatch): The Japanese Communist Party Headquarters Countermeasures Committee issued a statement on September 26th, calling on patriotic people, patriotic parties, and democratic groups across Japan to unite, oppose the separate peace treaty with Japan and the US-Japan "Security Treaty," and fight for national independence.

　　The statement said: The people of Japan are ardently hoping for peace, rejecting the separate peace treaty, and demanding comprehensive peace negotiations and the withdrawal of all occupying forces in order to achieve the independence and peace of the Japanese nation. There is no doubt that the historically significant task of various patriotic parties and democratic groups is to respond to the ardent demands of the people, overcome all obstacles, abandon all selfish interests, and fight for the interests of the nation. This is the demand of the Japanese people and is supported by the people of Asia and the world.

　　The statement said: We call on the people of all strata: except for a small number of traitors represented by the Yoshida government, unite under the banner of the national liberation front and fight for national unity and salvation. The Japanese Communist Party will resolutely and loyally fight to the end to achieve this goal.

　　The statement put forward the following proposals of the Japanese Communist Party:

　　(1) Resolutely oppose the separate peace treaty and the US-Japan "Security Treaty" that prepare for war and humiliation.

　　(2) Demand the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty based on the Potsdam Proclamation that guarantees the independence of the Japanese nation and Japanese sovereignty, abolishes the occupation system, and promptly withdraws all occupying forces.

　　(3) Oppose war propaganda and defend peace. Establish friendly relations between Japan and all countries in the world, especially Asian countries.

　　(4) Oppose the national security law, the anti-strike law, and all other repressive decrees that the government is planning, which promote militarism. We demand freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, strikes, demonstrations, and religious belief.

　　(5) Give workers wages that can sustain their lives, give farmers land that can enable them to survive, and stipulate fair rice prices. Enable all people to have jobs and families. Strive for the development of peaceful industries and the freedom of enterprises. Abolish heavy taxes.

　　(6) Overthrow the traitorous, warmongering, fascist Yoshida government.

    文告说：日本全国人民都热烈地希望和平，拒绝接受单独和约，要求全面媾和与撤退全部占领军，以实现日本民族的独立与和平。毫无疑问，各爱国政党和各民主团体的具有历史意义的任务就是回答人民的这种热烈的要求，克服一切障碍和放弃一切自私的利益，为民族的利益而奋斗。这是日本全国人民的要求，是亚洲和全世界人民所支持的。
    文告说：我们向各阶层的人民号召：除掉吉田政府所代表的一小撮卖国分子以外，都要一致团结在民族解放战线的旗帜下，为团结救国而斗争。日本共产党将坚决地、忠诚地为实现这种目的而奋斗到底。
    文告提出了日本共产党的主张如下：
    （一）坚决反对准备战争和屈辱的单独和约和美日“安全条约”。
    （二）要求根据波茨坦公告缔结一个保证日本民族独立和日本主权的全面和约，废除占领制度，并迅速撤退全部占领军。
    （三）反对战争宣传，保卫和平。日本和世界各国，特别是和亚洲各国，建立友好关系。
    （四）反对军国主义化的国家保安法、禁止罢工法及其他一切政府正在计划中的镇压法令。我们要求言论、出版、集会、结社、罢工、游行及宗教信仰的自由。
    （五）给工人以能够维持生活的工资，给农民以能够生存的土地并规定公平的米价。使全体人民有职业有家庭。争取和平产业的发展和企业的自由。废除苛重的捐税。
    （六）打倒卖国的、好战的法西斯吉田政府。
