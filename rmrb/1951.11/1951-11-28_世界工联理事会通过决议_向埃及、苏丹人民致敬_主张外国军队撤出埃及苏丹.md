    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 27th: According to TASS, the Berlin meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council adopted a resolution at its closing session on the 21st, representing the 80 million working people participating in the World Federation of Trade Unions, to pay tribute to the people of Egypt and Sudan who are fighting for freedom and national independence.
    The resolution emphasizes that the working people of Egypt and Sudan have risen up against the British and American imperialists to fight for the elimination of poverty and appalling living conditions, which are mainly caused by the long-term rule of foreign imperialism. The working class of Egypt and Sudan bears the task of leadership in the united front for national liberation, and they must unite all democratic and popular forces around them. The trade union organizations of Egypt and Sudan must consolidate the unity of the working class in order to strive for the improvement of the living conditions of the working people, to strive for trade union rights, freedom, social legislation, and to strengthen the alliance of the working people and people of other strata.
    The resolution calls on trade union organizations and working people of all countries to fully support the just struggle of the people of Egypt and Sudan for freedom and national independence, and against British and American imperialism, and emphasizes that the World Federation of Trade Unions fully supports the resolutions of the Vienna Conference of the World Peace Council on the Near East and Middle East, demanding that all foreign troops immediately withdraw from Egypt and Sudan.
