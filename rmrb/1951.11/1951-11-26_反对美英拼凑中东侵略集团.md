    Oppose the US-British Plot to Assemble an Aggression Group in the Middle East
    The US and British imperialists are currently stepping up their conspiracy to assemble an aggression group in the Middle East, which seriously threatens peace and security in the region. On November 21st, the Soviet government sent notes to the governments of Egypt and other Middle Eastern countries regarding the proposal by the governments of the US, Britain, France, and Turkey to establish the so-called “Middle East Command.” The notes exposed the aggressive intentions of the US and British imperialists and drew the attention of the Egyptian government and others to the fact that if they participated in the so-called “Middle East Command,” it would inevitably seriously damage their relations with the Soviet Union and the cause of peace and security in the Middle East. The Soviet government's solemn statement not only struck a blow to the US, Britain, and other countries' aggressive plots against the Middle East but also demonstrated the Soviet Union's deep concern for the people of the Middle East. This statement will surely win the support of the people of the Middle East and the people of the world.
    The continuous upsurge of the anti-imperialist movement of the people of the Middle East has greatly alarmed the US and British imperialists. Therefore, the US and British imperialists are hastily applying crude pressure, threats, and blackmail against Middle Eastern countries. Recently, the governments of the US, Britain, France, and Turkey, on the one hand, once again "notified" the governments of Middle Eastern countries that the "Middle East Command" was about to be established, and on the other hand, issued a statement of so-called "principles" for the establishment of the "Middle East Command," especially using aid in "armaments and equipment" to lure Middle Eastern countries to join the "Middle East Command." At the same time, the United States has also dispatched some officials to visit Middle Eastern countries in an attempt to force them to join the Middle East aggression group. The US and British imperialists' active conspiracy to assemble a Middle East aggression group, on the one hand, is an attempt to suppress the anti-imperialist movement of the people of the Middle East, and on the other hand, it also exposes their conspiracy to further exploit the territory and resources of Middle Eastern countries to carry out aggression against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.
    However, the era of imperialism oppressing and deceiving the people has passed. The people of the Middle Eastern countries have long gained painful experience from some "alliance" treaties that their countries have signed with imperialism in the past. The terrible disasters caused by the "Marshall Plan" in Western European countries have made them realize the essence of the so-called "aid" of imperialism. The Egyptian government, with the support of the Egyptian people, has rejected the four-nation proposal. The people of Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel have also held rallies and demonstrations to oppose the four-nation proposal. The rising tide of opposition among the people of the Middle Eastern countries against the US and British imperialist plot to assemble a Middle East aggression group has greatly increased the difficulty for the US and British imperialists to realize their aggressive plans and will ultimately lead to the bankruptcy of this conspiracy.

### 反对美英拼凑中东侵略集团

    反对美英拼凑中东侵略集团
    目前美英帝国主义正在加紧拼凑中东侵略集团的阴谋活动，这种活动严重地威胁着中东的和平与安全。本月二十一日苏联政府就美、英、法、土四国政府提出的建立所谓“中东司令部”的建议，照会埃及和其他中东国家的政府，揭露美英帝国主义的侵略目的，并提请埃及等国政府注意，如果它们参加了所谓“中东司令部”，就必然要严重地损害它们和苏联之间的关系与中东各国的和平与安全事业。苏联政府的严正声明，不但打击了美英等国对中东各国的侵略图谋，并表现了苏联对中东人民的深切关怀。这个声明必将获得中东人民和全世界人民的拥护和支持。
    由于中东各国人民反帝运动的不断高涨，已使美英帝国主义惊慌万分。因此，美英帝国主义正匆忙地向中东各国施用粗暴的压力以及威胁与讹诈。最近，美、英、法、土四国政府，一面再度“通知”中东各国政府说“中东司令部”即将成立，一面又发表了成立“中东司令部”的所谓“原则”的声明，特别以“军火和装备方面”的援助来诱胁中东各国参加“中东司令部”。与此同时，美国并派遣了一些官员到中东各国去进行“访问”，企图压迫中东各国参加中东侵略集团。美英帝国主义积极拼凑中东侵略集团的阴谋活动，一方面固然是妄图借此镇压中东各国人民的反帝运动，同时也暴露了它们企图进一步利用中东国家的领土和资源进行对苏联和人民民主国家的侵略的阴谋。
    然而，帝国主义压迫与欺骗人民的时代已经过去了。中东各国人民早已在过去他们国家和帝国主义订立过的一些“同盟”条约中获得了痛苦的经验；“马歇尔计划”在西欧各国造成的可怕的灾难，已使他们认识到帝国主义的所谓“援助”的本质是什么。埃及政府在埃及人民的支持下已拒绝了四国建议，伊拉克、叙利亚、黎巴嫩和以色列人民也纷纷举行集会和示威反对四国建议。中东各国人民反对美英帝国主义拼凑中东侵略集团声浪的日益高涨，大大增加了美英帝国主义实现它们的侵略计划的困难，并将最后使这个阴谋计划归于破产。
