    My Impressions of the Soviet Union
  　Liu Qing
    I arrived in the great socialist and advanced country of the Soviet Union and its solemn and magnificent capital, Moscow, with extraordinary excitement.
    Such a valuable visit has been my ideal for a long time.
    Although this is my first time in the Soviet Union, this free and happy country created and led by the great Comrades Lenin and Stalin is not unfamiliar to me. Since I learned to read, the Soviet people and their victorious struggles, through the successful descriptions of outstanding Soviet writers, have continued to be active in my mind. Levenson in "Rout" and Kochubey in "The Iron Flood," Gore in "Cement" and Davydov in "Virgin Soil Upturned," Oleg in "The Young Guard" and Shaburov in "Days and Nights"... etc., all seem like friends I am familiar with. The forests of the Far East, the villages of the Don River, the mining areas of Donbas, the streets of Stalingrad... etc., are places I have already visited in my imagination.
    Besides my motherland, the Soviet Union is the country I feel closest to in the world. I remember when the Red Army and the German invaders were engaged in a great battle near Moscow, and when they were fighting house to house in Stalingrad, I waited anxiously every day to read the day's newspaper. During the Red Army's great counter-offensive, I drew red circles all over the western part of the Soviet map, all the way to Brest—the westernmost city of the Soviet Union. I worried about the difficulties of the Soviet people, and I was encouraged by the victories of the Soviet people. I regard Tanya (Zoya) and Matrosov as the glory of mankind.
    The historic victory won by the Chinese people under the leadership of our great leader Comrade Mao Zedong has made the friendship that has long existed between our two peoples even closer. There have been many mutual visits between the people of the two countries, and I deeply feel that it is my happiness to come to the Soviet Union with the Chinese writers' delegation this time. When I got on the Soviet train in Manchuria, as soon as I arrived in Otpor, I couldn't restrain my feelings. It was an early winter evening, and snow covered the land beside the railway; but I turned off the lights in the carriage and looked out greedily with excitement. During the long journey through Siberia, the train took me to a fresh environment every moment. The Amur's forest like black clouds, the Buryat-Mongolian cattle herds, the harvested fields on both sides of the Ob River, the coal mines of the Kuznetsk Basin, and the forest-like chimneys of Novosibirsk, made me imagine how wonderful the life of the Soviet people under the light of Lenin and Stalin is, even on the train! On the train, I read Babayevsky's "Light Over the Land," which describes the dawn of communism about to shine on this part of the earth.
    When I saw Moscow, it was as if I saw a colorful paradise. This is not the legendary paradise in myths, but the paradise on earth where the great Comrade Stalin is, created by the Soviet people with labor and wisdom. The day after I arrived in Moscow, I and my companions toured the wide and clean streets of Moscow. The huge buildings that sprung up from the ground like bamboo shoots after rain, and the subway stations that were more magnificent than palaces, filled me with admiration for the noble labor and unlimited creativity of the Soviet people.
    During my travels and tours in the Soviet Union, I often think of my motherland. In Siberia, I thought of the Northeast that I had passed through a few days ago. In Moscow, I thought of Beijing. The Chinese people, represented by the great Comrade Mao Zedong, are brave, hardworking, and intelligent. While our people are using highly patriotic labor production to support the Chinese People's Volunteers who are victoriously striking the American aggressors in Korea, the huge Huai River water conservancy project is also proceeding rapidly, and a long row of buildings is being built on East Chang'an Street, Beijing's largest road. This is just the beginning. Seeing today's Soviet Union and Moscow, it is as if I see tomorrow's China and Beijing. Seeing the Soviet Union, I love my motherland even more. My heart is full of beautiful dreams for the future of our motherland.
    I left Beijing after spending the National Day on October 1st. One month and seven days later, I celebrated the 34th anniversary of the October Revolution in Moscow. The two magnificent parades seen in Tiananmen Square and Red Square are linked together in my mind. On the faces of the heroic soldiers of our two countries, who are of different colors, there is a serious expression of the same confidence; in the torrents of the people of the two countries, they warmly cheer the same desire in different languages. This desire and confidence is to create a life that is happier day by day for us and to resolutely defend world peace. On these two significant days, I fully felt that we have sufficient strength!

    我到苏联的感想
  　柳青
    我怀着异常兴奋的心情来到伟大的社会主义的先进国家苏联和她的庄严富丽的首都莫斯科。
    作这样一次可贵的访问是我很久以来的理想。
    虽然这是我第一次到苏联来，但是伟大的列宁和斯大林同志所创造和领导的这个自由幸福的国家，对我并不生疏。从我会读书时起，苏联人民和他们胜利的斗争，通过苏联优秀作家成功的描写，就继续不断地活动在我的脑里。“毁灭”里的莱奋生和“铁流”里的郭甫久鹤，“士敏土”里的哥里和“被开垦的处女地”里的达维多夫，“青年近卫军”里的奥列格和“日日夜夜”里的沙布洛夫……等等，好像都是我所熟悉的朋友。远东的森林，顿河的乡村，顿巴斯的矿区，斯大林格勒的街道……等等，是我在想像中已经到过的地方了。
    除了我的祖国，苏联是世界上我最感到亲切的国家。记得红军和德寇在莫斯科近郊进行大会战的时候，在斯大林格勒进行逐屋战的时候，我每天都是那么焦急地等待着看当天的报纸。在红军大反攻的时候，我在苏联地图的西部画满了红圈，一直到布列斯特——苏联最西边的一个城市。我为苏联人民的困难忧虑过，我被苏联人民的胜利鼓舞过。我把丹娘（卓娅）和马特洛索夫当作人类的光荣。
    中国人民在自己的伟大领袖毛泽东同志领导下所获得的历史性的胜利，使我们两国人民中间久已存在的友谊更加密切了。两国人民互相亲密地访问已经有过许多次，我这次参加中国作家代表团来到苏联，深深地感到这是我的幸福。从满洲里上了苏联的火车，一到奥特波尔，我就遏止不住自己的感情。那是一个初冬的晚上，雪盖着铁路旁边的土地；但是我关了车厢里的灯，兴奋地贪婪地向外探望。在漫长的西伯利亚旅行中，火车每一时刻都把我带到新鲜的环境。阿穆尔斯克黑云一样的森林，布利亚蒙古的牛群，奥伯河两岸收割过的田野，库兹涅次克盆地的煤矿，以及诺沃西比尔斯克树林一样的烟囱，使我即使在火车上也能想像到苏联人民在列宁、斯大林光辉下的生活是多么美好！我在火车上读着巴巴也夫斯基的“地上的光明”，这小说描写着共产主义的曙光即将照耀到地球的这一部分了。
    我看见莫斯科，好像看见了色彩缤纷的天堂。这不是传说的神话里的天堂，这是苏联人民用劳动和智慧创造的伟大斯大林同志所在的人间的天堂。我到莫斯科的第二天，曾和我的同伴们在莫斯科宽阔清洁的大街上游览过。像雨后春笋一样从地上升起的巨大建筑物，比宫殿更富丽堂皇的地道车站，使我对苏联人民高尚的劳动和无限的创造性充满了敬佩。
    在苏联的旅行和游览中，我时常想起我的祖国。在西伯利亚我想起几天以前经过的东北。在莫斯科我想起北京。以伟大的毛泽东同志为代表的中国人民是勇敢、勤劳和智慧的。当我国人民正用高度的爱国主义的劳动生产来支援在朝鲜胜利地打击美国侵略者的中国人民志愿军的时候，巨大的淮河水利工程同时迅速地进行着，北京最大的马路东长安街正在兴建一长列的大楼。这仅仅是开始。我看见今天的苏联和莫斯科，好像看见了明天的中国和北京。看见了苏联，我更爱我的祖国。我对我们祖国的未来充满了美丽的憧憬。
    我是在北京度过了十月一日的国庆节出发的。一个月零七天以后，我在莫斯科欢度十月革命的三十四周年纪念日。在天安门和红场看见的两次雄伟壮阔的检阅，在我的脑里联成了一片。我们两国的英雄的战士们不同肤色的脸上，严肃地表示着同一的信心；在两国人民群众的巨流里用不同的语言，热烈地欢呼着同一的愿望。这愿望和信心就是创造我们一天比一天更幸福的生活和坚决地保卫世界和平。我在这两个意义重大的日子里，充分感觉到我们是有足够强大的力量的！
            一九五一年十一月八日在莫斯科
