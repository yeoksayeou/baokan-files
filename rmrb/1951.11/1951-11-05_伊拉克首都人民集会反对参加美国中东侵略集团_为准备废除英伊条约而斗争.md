Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, 2nd: According to TASS, more than a thousand people in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, recently participated in a rally initiated by the People's United Front and the National Democratic Party, despite the authorities' ban.

Hashimi, leader of the People's United Front, and Chadarchi, leader of the National Democratic Party, delivered speeches at the rally. Their speeches in support of the Egyptian people's struggle against British imperialism aroused stormy applause.

Both speakers demanded that the Iraqi government reject the proposals of the United States, Britain, France, and Turkey regarding the establishment of a so-called "joint defense" system.

Chadarchi pointed out in his speech that although "the decline of British imperialism" is near, the Iraqi people still "must prepare for a difficult struggle to abolish the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930."
