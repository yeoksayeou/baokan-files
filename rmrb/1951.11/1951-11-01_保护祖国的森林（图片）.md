    Protect the Forests of the Motherland
    Liu Jiyu
    (4) At the foot of Changbai Mountain, in Chunsheng Village, Muling County, Songjiang Province, there is a forest ranger named Wang Qingheng. Under his care, an area of more than one hundred square li of forest has not experienced a single fire nor has it been damaged. Therefore, he received the honor of attending the National Congress of Labor Heroes and Model Workers.
    (5) Wang Qingheng is good at mobilizing the masses to protect the forest. He uses the Communist Youth League, the Democratic Women's Federation, and schools to publicize the significance of forest protection, explaining the importance of forests to national construction and their relationship to everyone's immediate interests.
    (6) He often says to people, "The large buildings of the country and the utensils used by individuals cannot be separated from wood. When a person is born, wood must be used to make a cradle, and when they die, wood is used to make a coffin. The forest also produces various by-products, such as wood ear and mushrooms, which can be picked and sold for money."
    (7) The peasants, recognizing the importance of forest protection, used democratic methods to establish a covenant for fire prevention and forest protection.

    保护祖国的森林
    刘继卣
    （四）在长白山麓，松江省穆棱县纯盛村，有一位护林员叫王清恒。在他护理下的一块一百多方里的林区里没有发生过一次火灾，也没有受到过破坏。因而他获得了出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的荣誉。
    （五）王清恒善于发动群众来护林。他通过青年团、民主妇女联合会和学校，来宣传护林的意义，讲解森林对国家建设的重要性和对大家切身利益的关系。
    （六）他常对人说：“国家大的建筑和个人使的用具都离不开木头。人生下来就得用木头作摇车，死了用木头做棺材。森林里还出产各种副产物，如木耳、蘑菇等都能拾来卖钱。”
    （七）农民们认识了护林的重要，用民主方法订立了防火护林的公约。
