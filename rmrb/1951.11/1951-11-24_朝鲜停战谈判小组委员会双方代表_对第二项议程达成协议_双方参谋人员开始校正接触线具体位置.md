    朝鲜停战谈判小组委员会双方代表
    对第二项议程达成协议
    双方参谋人员开始校正接触线具体位置
    【新华社开城二十三日电】十一月二十三日，朝鲜停战谈判小组委员会双方代表，对于第二项议程达成了正式协议。双方参谋人员同时开始校正现有接触线的具体位置，以便提交小组委员会正式确定为军事分界线与非军事地区的中线，小组委员会将连同协议一并呈交代表团大会批准。小组委员会所通过的协议全文如下：
    朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团及联合国军代表团双方小组委员会，对于第二项议程“作为在朝鲜停止敌对行为的基本条件，确定双方军事分界线，以建立非军事地区”，兹达成以下协议：
    （一）确定以双方实际接触线（视情况而按照第二或第三段确定之）为军事分界线，并在已签字的停战协议中所具体规定的时间，双方各由此线后退二公里，以建立军事停战期间的非军事地区的原则。
    （二）双方小组委员会立即根据前条原则，确定现有接触线，以定之为军事分界线与非军事地区的中线。如在代表团大会批准本协议及上述军事分界线与非军事地区的具体位置后的三十天内，军事停战协议已经签字，则不论双方实际接触线有何变化，该军事分界线及非军事地区应不再予以变更。
    （三）鉴于敌对行为将继续进行至停战协议签字时为止，如在代表团大会批准本协议及上述第二段中所确定的军事分界线与非军事地区的具体位置后的三十天内，军事停战协议尚未签字，则双方小组委员会应在军事停战协议即将签字时，按照双方实际接触线所发生的变化而修正上述军事分界线与非军事地区，使修正后的军事分界线与军事停战协议即将签字时的双方接触线完全一致，作为军事停战期间的军事分界线。
