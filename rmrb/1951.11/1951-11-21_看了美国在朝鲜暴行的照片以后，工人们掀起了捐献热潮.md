    After Seeing Photos of American Atrocities in Korea, Workers Launched a Donation Craze
    Editor: The People's Daily published on November 15th a Korean dispatch entitled "Accuse the American Murderers!" and ten photos of the American army's atrocities. After we saw these ten photos, everyone hated the brutality of the American devils. Worker Old Zhao silently circled this dispatch and the ten photos with a red pen, and wrote in red next to it: "Comrades! Take a look, how many Korean people have the American imperialists killed!" Underneath he wrote the words "Blood Debt!" and posted it on the blackboard newspaper. The blackboard newspaper was immediately surrounded by people. People shouted and cursed: "Damn it! They are even more brutal than the Japanese devils!" "If it weren't for our Volunteer Army, could we still be living such a peaceful life now?" Immediately, many people took their wages and ran to donate. Comrade Wu Zhitian, whose salary was not high, donated 40,000 yuan at once. He also said: "Let's donate more planes so that we can drive away the American devils sooner and save more Korean people." That day, seven groups completed their annual donation plan. After reading the newspaper, the comrades in charge of the workshop discussed it and decided to challenge other workshops: "Not only will we guarantee that all eleven groups in the entire workshop will complete the annual donation plan one month ahead of schedule, but we will also strive to exceed the quota by one million yuan!" After hearing this news, various workshops responded one after another, launching a donation campaign. Su Mingzhang

    看了美国在朝鲜暴行的照片以后，工人们掀起了捐献热潮
    编辑同志：十一月十五日人民日报刊登了“控告美国杀人犯！”的一篇朝鲜通讯和十张美国军队暴行的照片。当我们看了这十张照片以后，大家都痛恨着美国鬼子的残暴。工人老赵一声也不言语地用红笔把这篇通讯和十张照片圈上了，又用红笔在旁边写上了“同志们！看一看，美帝国主义杀了多少朝鲜人民！”底下又写上了“血债！”两个大字，便把它贴到黑板报上去。黑板报前立刻围满了人。大伙嚷的嚷，骂的骂：“他妈的！真是比日本鬼子还残暴！”“要不是咱们志愿军，咱们还能过现在这样的太平日子？”这一下子，好多人拿了工资就跑去捐献。工资不多的吴执田同志一下就捐了四万元。他还说：“咱们多捐一架飞机，早一天打走美国鬼子，就可以多救出一些朝鲜老百姓。”当天就有七个小组完成了全年捐献计划。管理车间的同志们在看了报纸以后，大伙一合计，就决定向别的车间挑战：“不但保证全车间十一个组提前一个月完成全年捐献计划，而且还要争取超额一百万元！”各车间听了这个消息以后，就纷纷应战，展开捐献运动。　苏铭璋
