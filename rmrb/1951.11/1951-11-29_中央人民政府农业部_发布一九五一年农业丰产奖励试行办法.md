The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government
Issues the Trial Measures for Rewarding Agricultural Abundant Harvests in 1951

    I. To promote the rural patriotic abundant harvest movement and guide farmers to actively increase yield per unit area, these measures are formulated.

    II. This year's rewards are temporarily limited to cotton, rice, wheat, millet (foxtail millet), corn (maize), soybeans, and tubers (sweet potatoes, potatoes). The recipients of the rewards are individual farmers, mutual aid teams, and agricultural production cooperatives that have achieved high yields this year. Those who have achieved high yields of crops not listed above and general production models shall be rewarded by the Greater Administrative Areas and the Provincial People's Governments themselves.

    III. The mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives with the highest average yield per unit area and the individual farmers with high yield per unit area among the above-mentioned crops must be recognized by the local farmers. After investigation and verification by the Greater Administrative Areas and the Provincial People's Governments according to the prescribed yield standards, their resumes and abundant harvest experiences shall be compiled into detailed materials and reported to the Ministry for evaluation and awarding. The standard for high yield shall be determined by the Ministry as a reference, and the provinces shall determine it themselves and report it to the Ministry for approval.

    IV. Due to different regional conditions, those who have achieved particularly high yields in crops not listed above and are deemed to have reward value after review by the Greater Administrative Areas and the Provincial People's Governments may also be reported to the Ministry for rewards.

    V. Three to five people who have the highest yield in each of the above-mentioned crops will be selected as national model for abundant harvest new record this year, and will be given special rewards.

    VI. Farms at all levels that reach the prescribed standard yield in the above-mentioned crops shall also be reviewed and reported for awards by the Greater Administrative Areas and the Provincial People's Governments.

    VII. Unit area shall be calculated in Chinese "mu" (市亩), and yield shall be calculated in Chinese "jin" (市斤). The minimum award-winning area for individuals is one "mu," and the remaining land must be higher than the average yield level in the local area. Mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives must have an average yield per household higher than the general level in the local area, otherwise no rewards will be given.

    VIII. Award recipients must be patriots.

    IX. Awards are divided into: (1) Medals. (2) Certificates of Merit. (3) Agricultural tools, machinery, and medicines (or other in-kind items). (4) Cash. Individuals will only receive honorary awards; mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives that receive honorary awards will also receive in-kind awards.

    X. The Greater Administrative Areas and the Provincial People's Governments should immediately instruct local governments to promptly discover abundant harvest objects and determine standards on a province-by-province basis. The provincial organization shall be responsible for investigating and studying abundant harvest objects. When crops are harvested, accurately measure the area yield, and record the summaries to be reviewed and reported level by level, and then be forwarded to the Ministry by the Greater Administrative Areas and Provincial (North China Provinces) People's Governments. The Ministry will then review in detail and select key points for spot checks.

    XI. The awards will be issued by the Greater Administrative Areas and the Provincial People's Governments entrusted by the Ministry on behalf of the Ministry, and the method of the award ceremony will be determined separately.

                                           Minister Li Shucheng
