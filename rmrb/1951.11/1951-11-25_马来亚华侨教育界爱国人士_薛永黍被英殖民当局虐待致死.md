Xinhua News Agency, dated 24th: According to Singapore news: Xue Yongshu, a patriotic figure in Malayan Chinese education circles, died in a Singapore prison on November 10th after suffering severe torture by the British colonial government. Upon hearing the news, returned overseas Chinese from Beijing and relevant parties expressed their condolences and indignation, believing that the British colonial government should bear full responsibility for the crime of persecuting Xue Yongshu.

Xue Yongshu, a native of Fujian, was in his sixties. He served as a professor at Xiamen University for more than ten years. From 1938, he served as the principal of Singapore Chinese High School, dedicated to overseas Chinese education. He also served as the chairman of the Singapore Teachers' Association and actively participated in patriotic and democratic endeavors. He was subjected to all kinds of persecution by the Chiang Kai-shek gang and the British colonial government, and was forced to leave Chinese High School. Later, Mr. Xue worked for the overseas Chinese company Kun Hing Company. This June, the British colonial government detectives searched Kun Hing Company and unreasonably arrested a group of responsible persons from the company. Xue Yongshu was one of those arrested and was imprisoned in the Singapore concentration camp, eventually tortured to death by the British colonial government.

    薛永黍被英殖民当局虐待致死
    【新华社二十四日讯】据新加坡消息：马来亚华侨教育界爱国人士薛永黍在备受英国殖民地政府虐待之后，十一月十日死于新加坡狱中。北京归国华侨和各有关方面闻讯，都表示哀悼和悲愤，认为英国殖民地政府应对迫害薛永黍的罪行负全部责任。
    薛永黍原籍福建，现年六十多岁，曾任厦门大学教授十多年，一九三八年起任新加坡华侨中学校长，热心华侨教育，曾任新加坡教师公会主席，积极参加爱国民主事业，受到蒋匪帮和英国殖民地政府的百般迫害，被迫离开华侨中学。以后，薛先生到侨商昆兴公司任职。今年六月，英殖民地政府警探搜查昆兴公司，无理逮捕该公司一批负责人。薛永黍是被捕者之一，被监禁在新加坡集中营中，终于被英国殖民地政府虐待致死。
