Relying on the Working Masses to Overcome the Ideology of "Only Caring About Production, Not Management"
    Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory Largely Completes Asset Inventory Work
    To Thoroughly Complete the Task of Verifying Funds in the Future, We Must Extensively and Deeply Mobilize the Masses
    The asset inventory work of the state-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory began in mid-July and is now largely completed. Preliminary estimates indicate that the factory's accumulated funds exceed actual needs by more than two and a half times. This means that the factory is using the funds equivalent to two and a half factories of its own size. The factory's phenomenon of blindly storing mechanical and electrical materials is very serious. For example, the stock of spindles used in a certain textile machine was originally 10,000, but because the leading cadres were unaware, they bought another 15,000. As a result, the accumulated stock is enough for the factory to use for more than two years. The motor load of the factory's power plant has reached its maximum limit, and a large amount of external electricity must be purchased during maintenance. The factory has a 1,000 kW generator that can be used with a little repair, but the machine has been left in the yard and treated as waste. Instead of trying to utilize the old, large quantities of new materials were purchased, resulting in the filling of several large warehouses and many small workshops. The stored mechanical and electrical materials exceeded actual needs by 2.8 times, enough for the entire factory to use for ten months, seriously wasting state funds.

    The "only caring about production, not management" ideology of the leading cadres is the main reason for the factory's large accumulation of mechanical and electrical materials. They feel that managing an enterprise only requires doing a good job in production. There is no competition, all profits are turned over to the state treasury, and the level of production costs does not matter, as long as there is no corruption. In order to "ensure production," the factory stored a large amount of materials. Each workshop, in order to "ensure production," took out large batches of mechanical and electrical materials and stored them in small warehouses.

    The factory's material requisition system is very chaotic, which is also an important reason for the accumulation of materials. No one knows what materials are stored in the warehouse, when they will be useful, or who needs them. In addition, the consumption of various items lacks scientific norms, making it impossible to make an accurate material budget. When a workshop needs a mechanical part, they first look in their own small warehouse. If it is "not there," they issue a slip to the mechanical and electrical materials section to requisition a batch. The staff of the mechanical and electrical materials section look in the large warehouse. If it is "not there," they go to the repair shop to make it or go to the market to buy it. As a result, more and more materials are accumulated, and it becomes increasingly unclear. For example, each workshop has more than 240 extra electric motors. The tool and equipment responsibility system in each workshop has become a mere formality. Maintenance workers feel that there are plenty of tools and equipment. If they can't find something, they just get a new one, so they don't take care of them carefully.

    The factory has inventoried the warehouse three times, but it has not been cleared up. At that time, only a few cadres checked the assets against the accounts. The valuation of an old car was not even as high as the price of a new bicycle. This time, the factory established an asset inventory and fund verification committee from top to bottom, leading all workers to carry out this work, and launched inter-group challenge competitions to ensure that nothing was missed and that all surplus items were turned in. For example, two water meters and many tools were found from the long-unopened clothes locker. More than 70 workers, led by the factory director himself, and together with technical cadres, worked overtime on Sundays to clean up the large warehouse. Not only were a large number of defective products and stagnant equipment identified, but a weaving machine that had never been on the books was also cleared out. The factory had more than 30 incomplete weaving machines. By finding many parts from the accumulated mechanical parts, more than ten machines were repaired and supplemented. In the past, the factory's leading cadres kept a portion of boiler tubes and leather belt shafts as treasures. Now, after everyone's discussion, they realized that they would not be needed for the time being, so they were registered in the list of materials to be turned in. The materials returned by the small workshops were enough to fill two large warehouses. Factory director Li Chunli said, "If we don't mobilize the workers and only rely on the cadres, it would take half a year to clean up so thoroughly."

    The factory's asset inventory work has achieved great results. However, the mobilization of the masses is not deep enough, and some workers do not yet clearly understand the great significance of this work. The factory's leading cadres have recognized this problem and are planning to, based on the experience of the previous stage of work, more deeply and extensively mobilize the workers to thoroughly complete the task of verifying funds.

　　依靠工人群众，克服“只问生产、不管经营”的思想
    天津第二棉纺织厂清理资产工作大部完成
    今后彻底做好核定资金工作必须广泛深入地发动群众
    国营天津第二棉纺织厂清理资产工作于七月中旬开始，现已大部完成。据初步估计：该厂积压的资金超过实际需要的两倍半以上。这就是说，该厂使用着与自己同样大的两个半厂的资金。该厂盲目储存机物料的现象非常严重。某种纺织机用的锭子，库存量原有一万个，但因领导干部不知道，又买了一万五千个。结果，积存量足够该厂用二年多。该厂发电所电机负荷，已达最高限度，检修时必须大量购买外电。该厂有一台一千瓩的发电机，稍加修理，就能使用，但该机器一直放在院子里，被当成废料。不设法利用旧的，而大量购买新的，结果把几个大仓库和许多车间小仓库，都堆得满满的。储存的机物料超过了实际需要的二点八倍。足够全厂十个月的需用，严重浪费了国家的资金。
    领导干部的“只问生产，不问经营”的思想，是该厂大量积压机物料的主要原因。他们觉得管理企业，只要搞好生产就行，没有人竞争，利润都上缴国库，生产成本高低，都不必管，只要不贪污就行。厂方为了“保证生产”，就大量存东西，各车间为了“保证生产”，领出大批机物料，存在小仓库里。
    该厂领料制度十分混乱，这也是积压物料的重要原因。仓库里究竟存了什么材料，什么时候有用，谁也搞不清楚。加以各种物品的消耗，都无科学定额，以致无法作出精确的用料预算。车间需要什么机件，先到自己小仓库看看，如果“没有”，就开条子到机料科领一批。机料科人员到大仓库一看，如果“没有”，就到修理厂去做或到市场上去买。结果，材料越积越多，越弄不清。单电动机一项，各车间就多存了二百四十多台。各车间的工具器材负责制，实际上成为形式。保全工人觉得工具器材有的是，找不到了，再领新的，于是都不仔细保管。
    该厂曾经三次清点仓库，但仍没有点清楚。那时候只是少数干部把资产和账面核对一下，一部旧汽车的估价，还没有一辆新自行车的价钱高。这次该厂由上到下，成立了清理资产核定资金委员会，领导全体工人进行这一工作，并发动各小组互相挑战竞赛，保证不漏掉一样东西，保证多余的东西全部上缴。像钢丝并粗间，就从很久没有开过的存衣箱里，找出两个水表和很多工具。有七十多名工人，在厂长亲自率领下，和技术干部们一起，于星期日加班清理了大仓库。不但鉴定出大量废品和冷滞器材，还清理出一架账上从来没有过的织布机。该厂有三十多台残缺不全的织布机，由于从积压的机件中找出很多零件，经过整理补充，修好了十余台。过去该厂领导干部把一部分锅炉管子和皮带天轴，当做宝贝存起来，现在经过大家讨论，才知道暂时用不着，就登记在上缴物资里。各车间小仓库退回的物料，足足装了两个大仓库。该厂李春篱厂长说：“如果不发动工人，单靠干部，用半年时间也不能清理得这样彻底。”
    该厂清理资产工作，已收到了很大的成绩。但是，群众发动的还不够深入，有些工人还没有清楚地了解这一工作的伟大意义。该厂领导干部已认识到这一问题，正拟根据前一阶段工作的经验，更深入更广泛地发动工人群众，彻底做好核定资金工作。
