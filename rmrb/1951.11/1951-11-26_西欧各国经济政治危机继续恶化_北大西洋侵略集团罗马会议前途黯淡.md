Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: Under pressure from the United States, the North Atlantic Aggression Group is scheduled to hold a council meeting in Rome, the capital of Italy, on the 24th, in an attempt to resolve the serious contradictions between the United States and Western European countries on the issue of expanding armaments and preparing for war, so as to complete the original war preparations as soon as possible. However, due to the continued deterioration of the economic and political crisis in Western Europe, what lies ahead of the Rome meeting is a gloomy picture.

This meeting is a continuation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting held in Ottawa, the capital of Canada, in September of this year. At the Ottawa meeting, the United States strongly demanded that its vassal states further expand the scale of military expansion. However, the vassal states, because the past year of frantic military expansion and war preparations had plunged themselves into an inextricable economic and political crisis, stubbornly resisted the orders of the United States and instead demanded that the United States provide dollars as "aid," otherwise they would not be able to complete even the original plan.

In the past three months, the United States has carried out various open and secret activities in order to achieve the goals it failed to accomplish at the Ottawa meeting. Eisenhower's return to the country on the 5th and 6th of this month to "report on his duties" was an extremely important one. In addition, the United States has also exerted pressure on the governments of Western European vassal states in various ways on the eve of the meeting. In addition to U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, who is currently in Paris attending the United Nations General Assembly, constantly holding meetings with the foreign ministers of Britain and France outside the meeting, U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Bradley, Secretary of Defense Lovett, Secretary of the Army Pace, Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Perkins, and Director of Defense Production Fleishman are currently "visiting" the capitals of Western European countries and holding talks with various governments, and also consulting with Eisenhower, the U.S. military governor in Western Europe, and Harriman, the economic governor, in Paris. These actions fully demonstrate the extreme anxiety and unease on the part of the United States. According to Agence France-Presse, "Never before have so many U.S. defense chiefs gathered in Paris."

However, although the United States has spent so much effort in forcing Western Europe to prepare for war, it has not been able to change the situation in which the Western European economy has deteriorated day by day in the past three months, and thus has not been able to overcome the serious difficulties in the U.S. policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war in Western Europe. In early November, Harriman went to London to meet with the newly appointed British Prime Minister Churchill. As a result, according to a United Press London dispatch on the 3rd, Harriman and Churchill "discussed the serious economic and financial crisis that Britain will suffer this winter," and Churchill requested "more military and economic aid from the United States." A United Press Paris dispatch on the 9th further revealed that British Foreign Secretary Eden told Acheson in Paris that "Britain cannot complete its three-year military expansion plan if it does not receive U.S. aid." The situation in France is even worse than in Britain. The Pleven government decided on November 14 to drastically reduce imports purchased with U.S. dollars. A United Press Paris dispatch said that this move is equivalent to "reducing France's defense (should be read as war preparations) work unless the United States decides to supply France with a large amount of U.S. dollars in the coming months." According to the Paris "Liberation" newspaper, Harriman brought back letters of request for help from the French government when he returned to the United States at the end of October. The main idea of the letter was: "If the U.S. Congress does not allocate the U.S. dollars needed by France, the French government will collapse."

Thus, the United States clearly does not have more solutions at the Rome conference than it did at the Ottawa conference. U.S. Treasury Secretary Snyder, who roared at the Ottawa conference that anyone who did not expand armaments should not expect to get a single U.S. dollar, openly stated at a press conference held before leaving for Rome that whether the United States could provide economic assistance to Western European countries would have to wait for "a complete analysis" before making a decision. At the same time, he helplessly hinted that according to estimates by U.S. financial experts, the U.S. fiscal deficit for this year will reach 8.5 billion U.S. dollars. This will be the largest deficit in the United States since 1946.

What makes the United States feel棘手 at the Rome conference is not just the issue of a war economy crisis. At the Ottawa conference, the United States forced the North Atlantic Group to pass a resolution to conclude a so-called "peace agreement" with West Germany in order to arm West Germany on a large scale. However, since the high commissioners of the United States, Britain, and France in Germany and the West German puppet government began negotiations on September 24, there have been no definite results so far. The angry protests of people all over the world, especially the people of Europe, against this step by the United States, and the proposal of the People's Assembly of the German Democratic Republic to hold all-German elections to unify Germany and conclude a peace treaty with Germany as soon as possible, have seriously hit the U.S. plan. The negotiations that the United States originally thought could be completed as soon as possible have now been shelved as a result. The foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France had to schedule a direct meeting with West German puppet government Premier Adenauer in Paris on November 22 to study this issue. According to an Agence France-Presse Bonn dispatch on the 19th, Bonn "allied sources emphasized that a comprehensive agreement (on the 'peace agreement') is still a long way off." At the same time, although some agreements have been reached in the negotiations on the so-called "European Army" in Paris, which would allow West German troops to participate in the North Atlantic Army, according to an Agence France-Presse Washington dispatch on November 7, "people close to the White House and the Pentagon" are still worried that Western European countries are "considering this issue inconstantly."

At the Ottawa conference, the United States also pressured its vassal states to agree to allow Greece and Turkey to join the North Atlantic Treaty, laying the foundation for the establishment of a Middle East aggression group. However, to date, due to the strong opposition of the people of the Middle East, no Arab government has expressed its agreement to participate in the "Middle East Command" "initiated" by the United States, Britain, France, and Turkey. And the dispute between the United States and Britain over the actual command of the "Middle East Command" has been fiercely conducted behind the scenes. This will also cause trouble for the United States at the Rome conference.

Thus, one unsolvable problem after another lies before the Rome conference. According to an Agence France-Presse Paris dispatch on November 16, French Foreign Minister Schuman already believes that the Rome conference "will not make important decisions."

    西欧各国经济政治危机继续恶化
    北大西洋侵略集团罗马会议前途黯淡 【新华社二十二日讯】在美国的压力下，北大西洋侵略集团定于二十四日在意大利首都罗马举行理事会会议，企图解决美国和西欧国家在扩军备战问题上的严重矛盾，以尽速完成原定的备战步骤。但是，由于西欧经济政治危机的继续恶化，展开在罗马会议前面的，却是一片阴暗的景象。
    这次会议是北大西洋公约理事会今年九月在加拿大首都渥太华举行的会议的继续。在渥太华会议上，美国曾强硬地要求各仆从国家进一步扩大扩军的规模，但是各仆从国家因为过去一年间疯狂的扩军备战已使自己陷入无法解脱的经济和政治危机，曾顽梗地抵抗美国的命令，并且反而要求美国施舍美元予以“援助”，否则就要连原定计划都无法完成。
    三个月来，美国为了要达到它在渥太华会议上没有能完成的目标，曾进行了各种公开和秘密的活动。本月五、六两日艾森豪威尔的回国“述职”就是其中极重要的一个。此外，美国还在开会前夕向西欧各仆从国家政府多方行使压力。除现在巴黎出席联合国大会的美国国务卿艾奇逊正不断在会外和英法两国外长举行会议以外，美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷、国防部长罗维特、陆军部长佩斯、负责欧洲事务的助理国务卿波金斯、国防生产局局长佛莱西曼等人目前都在纷纷“访问”西欧各国首都，和各国政府举行会谈，并在巴黎和美国驻西欧军事总督艾森豪威尔、经济总督哈里曼会商。这些行动充分表明了美国方面的极度焦急不安。据法新社说：“过去从来不曾有过这么多的美国防务首脑人物聚集在巴黎。”
    但是，虽然美国在逼迫西欧备战方面花了这么大的气力，它却丝毫也不能改变三个月来西欧经济一天比一天恶化的情况，从而也无法克服美国在西欧推行扩军备战政策中的严重困难。十一月初哈里曼到伦敦和新近上台的英国首相邱吉尔会谈。结果，据合众社伦敦三日电透露：哈里曼和邱吉尔曾“讨论了今冬英国要遭受的严重经济和财政危机”，邱吉尔要求“美国方面更多的军事援助和经济援助”。合众社巴黎九日电更透露：英国外交大臣艾登在巴黎告诉艾奇逊说：“英国如果得不到美援，就不能完成它的三年扩军计划。”法国的情况比英国更坏，普利文政府已于十一月十四日决定大量削减要用美元购买的进口货，合众社巴黎电说，此举等于说“减少法国的防务（应读为备战）工作，除非美国决定在以后几个月里供给法国大量美元”。另据巴黎“解放报”报道：哈里曼在十月底返美时曾带有法国政府求援的信件，信中的主要意思是：“假使美国国会不拨给法国所需要的美元，法国政府就要垮台。”
    这样，美国在罗马会议上比它在渥太华会议上显然并没有更多的办法。曾经在渥太华会议上向各仆从国家咆哮谁不扩军，谁就休想得到一块美元的美国财政部长斯奈德，这次在离美赴罗马以前举行的招待记者会上，对于美国是否能给西欧各国以经济援助一事，公然声称须待作“一个完全的分析”以后再说，同时，他无可奈何地暗示：根据美国财政专家的估计，本年度美国的财政赤字将达八十五亿美元。这将是一九四六年以来美国最大的赤字。
    罗马会议使美国感到棘手的还不止是备战经济危机的问题。美国在渥太华会议上逼迫北大西洋集团通过了和西德缔结所谓“和平协定”以大规模武装西德的决议。但是自从九月二十四日美、英、法三国驻德高级专员和西德傀儡政府开始谈判以来，直到现在还没有什么确定的结果。全世界人民，特别是欧洲人民对于美国这一步骤的愤怒抗议，德意志民主共和国人民议会关于举行全德选举以统一德国并尽速缔结对德和约的建议，已经严重地打击了美国的计划。美国原来以为可以尽速完成的谈判，目前已因此而搁浅。美英法三国外长不得不定于十一月二十二日在巴黎和西德傀儡政府总理阿登纳直接举行会议，来研究这个问题。据法新社波恩十九日电透露：波恩“盟国人士强调说，（‘和平协定’的）全面协议仍遥遥无期”。同时，在巴黎举行的使西德军队参加北大西洋军的所谓“欧洲军”谈判，虽然已通过了一些协议，但是据法新社华盛顿十一月七日电透露：“接近白宫和五角大楼的人们”仍然担心西欧国家“朝三暮四地考虑这个问题”。
    美国在渥太华会议上还曾压迫它的附庸国家同意让希腊与土耳其参加了北大西洋公约，为成立中东侵略集团准备了基础。但是，到目前为止，由于中东各国人民的强烈反对，还没有一个阿拉伯国家政府表示同意参加美、英、法、土耳其四国所“发起”的“中东司令部”。而美英之间关于“中东司令部”实际指挥权的争吵也一直在幕后激烈进行。这也将给美国在罗马会议上造成烦恼。
    这样，摆在罗马会议面前的，是一个又一个无法解决的难题。据法新社巴黎十一月十六日电说：法国外长舒曼已经认为：罗马会议“将不会作出重要的决定来”。
