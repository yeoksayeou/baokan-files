　　The Propaganda Network of Tianjia Yao Village
    Propaganda Department of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China
    The propaganda network work of the Tianjia Yao Village Branch of the Communist Party of China in Xin County, Shanxi Province, has been done very well, promoting the prior completion of various tasks. Therefore, this village has always maintained the glorious title of "Advanced Village."

    The reason why the propaganda network work in this village has achieved great success is first because the branch pays attention to the ideological leadership of the propagandists and promptly solves the ideological and work problems of the propagandists. For example, when the propaganda network was established in February this year, the propagandists had many ideological problems, the most common being "too busy to do it." Propagandist Jia Jiefu once said: "Can a person grow several heads? I have so much work to do, and I still have to be a propagandist." After the branch learned of this situation, it held a meeting of propagandists and organized them to study the documents of the Party Central Committee on the establishment of a propaganda network. After discussion, everyone's thinking was straightened out.

    Secondly, the branch often educates propagandists to understand the ideological situation of the masses and use living people and events to propagate. When female propagandist Jie Aizhen was promoting warm water seed soaking, the masses were afraid of scalding the seeds to death and refused to soak them. The branch told Jie Aizhen that she could use on-site experiments to break the masses' concerns. Jie Aizhen first learned how to soak seeds from others, and then gathered the women together, promoting the benefits of seed soaking while demonstrating to everyone. The concerns of the masses were eliminated, and the method of seed soaking was quickly promoted. Subsequent work such as drought resistance and seedling protection was promoted in this way.

    Third, the branch established a leadership system for the propaganda network, such as propagandist liaison meetings and propagandist meetings. These systems were established on the basis of the propagandists' ideological consciousness, so everyone can abide by them. Originally, there was no such system. When mobilizing donations for airplanes and cannons, the propagandists did not hold a meeting to study in advance, but acted, and as a result, they did not mobilize the masses very well, and the situation of mass donations was not enthusiastic enough. The branch convened a meeting of propagandists to study, so that the propagandists realized that this was because they had not explained the significance of donating airplanes and cannons to the masses, so the masses did not donate much. So the propagandists re-propagated. In this way, in a very short period of time, the masses donated 1.84 million yuan. The branch seized this example to educate the propagandists that they should hold a meeting to study when something happens. From then on, everyone automatically stipulated liaison meetings and other systems. Although their liaison meetings were more frequent, they were all carried out when mutual aid teams were working, resting, or meeting at people's schools, so it did not hinder production.

    Fourth, the branch made full use of various propaganda tools. Tianjia Yao Village has many good propaganda tools and many non-Party propaganda organizations, including sixteen blackboards, twenty "mobilization placards," loudspeakers, five reading groups, and a people's school with 189 male and female students. The "mobilization placard" has a great propaganda effect. It is made of a wooden board that is two feet long and five inches wide. The central work of the village in each period is compiled into concise and vivid slogans and written on it. For example, when the Korean armistice talks began, the mobilization placard wrote: Do not relax the resistance to US aggression and aid to Korea because of the Korean negotiations! When mobilizing the masses to repair roads, it was written: Repair roads early to prepare for the autumn harvest. The masses welcomed the mobilization placards, saying: "You can understand what to do by looking at this placard, and it can also help you learn to read." The branch attaches great importance to the above-mentioned propaganda tools and propaganda organizations, and dispatches propagandists to participate in mastering and leading them. Whenever a propaganda task arrives, the branch uses these propaganda tools and propaganda organizations to carry out propaganda through the propagandists. This not only unifies the pace of propaganda work, which is conducive to centralized operations; but also unites non-Party propaganda workers to carry out work together.

    In addition, the Tianjia Yao Village branch also paid attention to the propaganda work in various mass organizations, assigning propagandists to youth, women, militia, and other organizations to implement a "contract system": when a central task arrives, everyone completes their own propaganda tasks.

    In this way, the propaganda work in Tianjia Yao Village has truly formed a "network." Now, as long as the branch assigns a propaganda task, it can be quickly implemented and made known to every household.

　　田家窑村的宣传网
    中共山西省委宣传部
    中共山西忻县田家窑村支部的宣传网工作作得很好，推动了各种工作的先期完成，因而这村一直保持着“先进村”的光荣称号。
    这村的宣传网工作所以有很大成绩，首先是因为支部注意对宣传员的思想领导，及时解决宣传员在思想上与工作上的问题。比如今年二月建立宣传网时，宣传员思想上有很多问题，最普遍的是“工作忙，干不了”。宣传员贾接福曾说：“人可长下几个脑袋？咱工作这么多，还要当宣传员。”支部了解了这一情况后，就召开宣传员会议，组织宣传员学习党中央关于建立宣传网的文件。经过讨论，大家打通了思想。
    其次支部经常教育宣传员要了解群众思想情况，用活人活事去宣传。女宣传员解爱贞在宣传温汤浸种时，群众因怕烫死种籽，不肯浸种。支部便告诉解爱贞可用实地试验的方法打破群众的顾虑。解爱贞便先向人学会浸种的方法，然后把妇女们召集起来，一面宣传浸种的好处，一面作给大家看。大家的顾虑消除了，浸种的方法很快推广开来。以后的抗旱保苗等工作，都是这样推动起来的。
    第三，支部建立了对宣传网的领导制度，如宣传员接头会，宣传员会议。这些制度都是在宣传员思想自觉的基础上建立的，所以大家都能遵守。原先是没有这种制度的。在发动捐献飞机大炮时，宣传员们事先没有开会研究，就行动起来，结果没有很好地把群众发动起来，群众捐献的情形不够热烈。支部就召集宣传员开会研究，使宣传员认识了，这是因为没有向群众说明捐献飞机大炮的意义，所以群众捐献不多。于是宣传员重新进行宣传。这样在很短的时间里，群众就捐献了一百八十四万元。支部抓住这个实例，教育宣传员有事就要开会研究。从此大家自动规定了接头会等制度。他们的接头会虽然次数较多，但都是利用互助组在一块作活、休息或上民校见面时来进行的，所以并不妨碍生产。
    第四，支部充分利用了各种宣传工具。田家窑村有许多很好的宣传工具和很多非党宣传组织，计有十六个黑板报、二十个“鼓动牌”、广播筒，五个读报组，另外有拥有男女学员一百八十九人的民校。“鼓动牌”的宣传作用很大，它是用一块长二尺、宽五寸的木牌作的。每个时期村子里的中心工作，都编成简捷生动的口号写到上边。如朝鲜停战谈判开始时，鼓动牌上写着：不因朝鲜谈判而放松抗美援朝！发动群众修路时写的是：提前修路，准备秋收。群众很欢迎鼓动牌，说：“作啥事一看这牌就明白了，还能帮助认字。”支部对上述宣传工具和宣传组织很重视，都派有宣传员参加掌握和领导。每当一个宣传任务到来时，支部就通过宣传员运用这些宣传工具和宣传组织进行宣传。这不仅统一了宣传工作的步调，利于集中作战；而且团结了非党宣传工作者一道进行工作。
    此外，田家窑村支部还注意了各种群众组织中的宣传工作，将宣传员分配到青年、妇女、民兵等组织中去，实行“包干制”：当一个中心工作到来时，各人完成自己的宣传任务。
    这样，田家窑村的宣传工作，真正形成了一个“网”。现在只要支部将一个宣传任务布置下去，很快就可以贯彻下去，作到家喻户晓。
