The U.S. 1st Cavalry Division has suffered many heavy blows on the Korean battlefield, but never has it been so devastatingly mauled as in this recent engagement. During Van Fleet's "Autumn Offensive," the 1st Cavalry Division was responsible for the main attack, advancing north from the area west of Tieyuan and Lianchuan in the Western Front. After two weeks of fierce fighting, it suffered over 10,000 casualties. During the battle, the division was reinforced three times due to heavy casualties. Captured officers and soldiers of the 1st Cavalry Division dejectedly said: "These are the darkest days in the history of the 1st Cavalry Division!"

A certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers guarded the area of about twenty kilometers wide on the left and right banks of the Imjin River. From this continuous undulating mountain position, Lianchuan and Tieyuan cities can be overlooked. The first goal of Van Fleet's offensive was to concentrate the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division, the 3rd Infantry Division, the British Commonwealth Division, the Greek Battalion, and the U.S. 25th Division, the puppet 1st Division, and other units to attack and occupy the positions on the left and right banks of the Imjin River.

Because of the low morale of the invading army, Ridgway had long been encouraging his soldiers, saying: Artillery fire can be your savior. In this "Autumn Offensive," the enemy concentrated more artillery units. According to captured U.S. artillery spotting pilot Seifering, the 1st Cavalry Division used heavy howitzers. In addition to the division's original six howitzer battalions, eight battalions were transferred from the U.S. First Corps. He himself was transferred from the 955th Artillery Battalion of the First Corps. During the offensive, the enemy's artillery poured tens of thousands of shells into our positions every day, but what was the result? Seifering said: "When I was scouting in the air, your position really became a no-man's land; but when I was captured, I saw your people everywhere." Curtis, the company commander of the 3rd Company of the 7th Regiment of the 1st Cavalry Division, said about his capture: "In my opinion, it was impossible for anyone to exist on the mountain, but when I discovered your people, it was too late."

The fact is indeed the case. The artillery fire used by the enemy this time was much more fierce than in the battle on the south bank of the Han River this spring. In that glorious defensive battle, our warriors figured out how to deal with the enemy's artillery fire and created great results. Now, the warriors who have been tempered by the war are even stronger. They said: "Let the enemy's corpses fill their own shell craters!"

The outline of the battle development is as follows: After the enemy launched the offensive, the first four days, from October 3rd to 6th, were the most intense. In order to seize a small hill, the enemy officers, regardless of the accumulating deaths and injuries, forced the soldiers to launch group charges in turn. After October 7th, the enemy changed from a full-line attack to a key attack. By the 12th, the enemy's offensive was completely crushed. In the first ten days of this battle, the 1st Cavalry Division advanced an average of only one hundred yards per day, and later it was impossible to move forward even an inch.

The Chinese People's Volunteers turned every mountain into a strong fighting fortress. In the battle, Zheng Yueguang, a shooting hero who killed 112 enemies in one day, emerged; the heroic Seventh Squad, who skillfully evaded more than 8,000 enemy shells and repelled seven attacks by an enemy battalion, emerged. A certain squad guarded a small mountain on the side of the road that the enemy had to pass. The enemy surrounded them with five tanks on the rear side of their position, and ten enemy planes bombed and strafed in turn. Our soldiers could not eat or drink, but they still bravely defeated the enemy's continuous attacks for five days.

Our powerful artillery units played an unprecedented role in supporting the infantry in this battle, causing the enemy to be utterly devastated. In front of the position of a certain unit of our army at Height 230.4, the enemy was gathering to launch an attack. Our artillery immediately fired accurately, causing the American soldiers to be blown to pieces. On the night of the 13th, two battalions of the enemy gathered in the Tianmudong gully, preparing to attack our position at dawn. The enemy had just set up tents to rest, and they were hit by our army's fierce volley fire, causing casualties everywhere. The enemy's ammunition was ignited, and the corpses were charred. It took the enemy twelve military vehicles to transport the corpses and wounded soldiers the next day.

Despite the fierce artillery cover of the 1st Cavalry Division's attack, and despite the fact that their officers were supervising the battle with guns behind them, the soldiers with low morale were as timid as mice under the heavy blows of our army, shrinking back and refusing to move forward. Ira, a soldier from the 3rd Platoon of the 3rd Company of the 5th Regiment of the 1st Cavalry Division, cursed the regiment commander LeFeide after being captured. He said: The officers just yelled wildly behind us: Advance! Advance! But advancing is a dead end. LeFeide had personally supervised the battle seven times, and as a result, lower-level officers and soldiers suffered greater casualties each time. Curtis, whose position as company commander was promoted during the battle after his predecessor was killed in action, was captured off guard. Foley, a black soldier from the heavy weapons company of the 5th Regiment, was fortunately captured as the third batch of soldiers to be replenished in this battle. The fate of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division is the best punishment for warmongers like Van Fleet.

　　朝鲜通讯痛歼美军骑一师
    新华社记者　阎吾
    美国骑兵第一师在朝鲜战场上已经受到过多次的沉重打击，但是，从来还没有遭到过像最近一次这样惨重的杀伤。在范佛里特的“秋季攻势”中，骑一师在西线担负自铁原、涟川以西地区北犯的主攻任务，经过了两个星期的激烈作战，共被杀伤万人以上。在战斗过程中，该师因伤亡惨重曾补充兵员三次。骑一师被俘的官兵垂头丧气地说：“这是骑一师历史上最黯淡的日子！”
    志愿军某部守卫在临津江左岸及右岸横宽二十余公里的地区，在这个绵亘起伏的山岭阵地上，可以俯瞰涟川、铁原二城。范佛里特发动这次攻势的第一步目标，是集中美国骑一师、步兵第三师、英国联邦师、希腊营，配合着美二十五师，伪一师等部，攻击并占领临津江左岸及右岸的阵地。
    由于侵略军士气低落，李奇微老早就鼓动他的士兵说：炮火能成为你们的救命恩人。在这次“秋季攻势”中，敌人集中了更多的炮兵部队。据被俘的美军炮兵校正机驾驶员西佛令供称：这次骑一师使用的重榴弹炮，除该师原来的六个榴弹炮营外，还从美军第一军团调来八个营，他本人也是从第一军团第九百五十五炮兵营调来的。在进攻中，敌人的炮兵每天将数万发炮弹倾泻到我军阵地上，但是结果怎样呢？西佛令说：“当我在空中侦察时，你们的阵地真变成一块无人之地了；而在我被俘的时候，我却看到遍地是你们的人。”骑一师第七团第三连连长库梯斯讲到他被俘时的情况说：“在我看来，山上已经不可能有人存在了，可是等到发现你们的人时，就什么都来不及了。”
    事实确实如此，敌人这次使用的炮火比起今年春天在汉江南岸的作战中不知要猛烈多少倍。在那次光辉的阻击战中，我们的勇士们曾经想出了对付敌人炮火的办法，创造了巨大的战果。现在，饱经战火锻炼的勇士们就更加坚强了。他们说：“要让敌人的尸体填平他们自己的炮弹坑！”
    战事发展的轮廓是这样的：敌人发起进攻以后，从十月三日到六日的头四天战斗最剧烈。为了争夺一个小山头，敌军军官们不顾死伤累累，逼着士兵轮番举行集团冲锋。从十月七日以后，敌人就由全线攻击改为重点进攻了。而到十二日，敌人的攻势便被彻底粉碎了。这次骑一师在头十天的作战中，平均每天仅前进一百码，到后来就寸步难进了。
    志愿军勇士们把每一座山岭变成坚强的战斗堡垒。在战斗中出现了一天中击毙敌人一百十二名的射击英雄郑月光；出现了巧妙地躲避过敌人八千多发炮弹，击退敌人一个营七次攻击的英雄第七班。某班守卫在敌人必经的路侧的小山上。敌人在他们的阵地后侧用五辆坦克把他们围住，十架敌机轮番轰炸扫射。我们的战士们吃不上饭，喝不上水，但仍然奋不顾身地打垮了敌人五天的连续攻击。
    我强大的炮兵部队在这次支援步兵的作战中发挥了空前的威力，把敌人打得焦头烂额。在二三零点四高地的我军某部阵地前，敌人正集结着准备发起冲锋。我军炮兵当即准确地发射，打得美军血肉横飞。十三日夜，敌军两个营集结在添木洞山沟里，准备到拂晓时向我阵地发起攻击。敌人刚刚搭起帐篷想休息，就被我军猛烈的排炮打得死伤遍地。敌人的弹药被打响了，尸体也烧焦了，到第二天敌人用十二辆军用汽车才运完尸首和伤兵。
    尽管骑一师这次进攻有多么猛烈的炮火掩护，尽管有其长官拿枪在后面督战，但士气不振的士兵们在我军沉重的打击下，个个胆小如鼠，畏缩不前。骑一师第五团第三连第三班士兵依勒，被俘后大骂该团团长勒菲德。他说：长官只是在我们后面狂叫：前进！前进！但前进是一条死路。在战斗中勒菲德已经亲自督战七次，结果是下层军官和士兵们遭到一次比一次更大的伤亡。在措手不及间被俘的库梯斯的连长的职务是在战斗中被提升的，因为前任连长在战斗中被打死了。第五团重武器连的黑人士兵福莱笛，他是在这次作战中第三批补充的士兵，他幸运地被俘了。美军骑一师的这种下场，是对好战分子范佛里特之流的最好的惩罚。
