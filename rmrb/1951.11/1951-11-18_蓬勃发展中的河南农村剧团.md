Editor's note: This article shows how, after land reform, farmers urgently needed new dramas and rejected dramas with old content; their amateur theatrical activities have formed such a large new force that needs strong support and guidance. This is something that cultural authorities at all levels, professional drama groups, and drama workers should pay close attention to.

With the completion of land reform, rural drama troupes in Henan are flourishing and constantly developing. In many places, as soon as the fruits of struggle were in hand and preparations for large-scale production were underway, the masses paid attention to their own cultural entertainment and began to restore or establish their village drama troupes. Especially after the three major movements of resisting America and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries were launched vigorously last year, rural drama troupes have become a very strong force in the rural propaganda army.

The Xuchang Special District was one of the earliest areas in Henan to undergo land reform. According to a survey conducted in July and August of this year, there are already more than 1,700 rural drama troupes. According to a survey in the Chenliu Special District, there is an average of one rural drama troupe in each township. According to a survey in a county in Luoyang, there are 45 relatively formal village drama troupes and 35 informal ones. Calculating together areas where land reform was completed earlier and areas where land reform was completed later, the number of village drama troupes in the province's ten special districts and two cities is over 10,000.

Because of the different times when land reform was completed throughout the province, different economic conditions in various regions, and different original foundations of village drama troupes, their development is also uneven. In advanced areas (such as the Xuchang Special District), many rural drama troupes already have good costumes and musical instruments, and well-organized organizations, while in areas with difficult conditions (such as in the Dabie Mountains), some still use bed sheets and white towels as costumes. However, one thing is common: the masses love their drama troupes. For every performance of a rural drama troupe, the nearby masses travel over mountains to listen.

Regarding the composition of the drama troupe actors, there are also great differences due to the different conditions in the entire region. In the Xuchang Special District, generally speaking, the "village drama troupe" has been regarded by cadres and the masses as a very sacred propaganda team, and people with improper conduct or problematic histories are not allowed to participate. The members of the troupe are Communist Party and Communist Youth League members, militia members, active women, rural primary school teachers, and progressive folk artists, who jointly organize a rural literary and art united front. Only in areas with poor conditions are there still a few loafers.

In terms of funding, it is also inconsistent. Because there is no fixed source of funding, some is "extracted" from the fruits of struggle, some is donated by the troupe members themselves, and some is voluntarily collected by the masses. However, more is sought from increased production. For example, in Mulou Township in the Zhengzhou Special District, the village drama troupe had no funding, so the members joined together to pack flower and yarn cloth for the Flower and Yarn Cloth Company, which solved all the difficulties in a day or two.

Rural drama troupes mostly developed from Yangko teams. At first, they were just happy to dance Yangko after being emancipated, but later they felt it was "not flavorful enough," so they moved to the stage. Generally, when they were first established, there were only male actors or only female actors, and they would dress as the opposite sex when performing; in the second stage, real couples played the couples in the play. For example, the drama troupe in Sufensi, Jia County, when performing "The Joy of Emancipation," was played by the peasant Wang Fuqian and his wife Jia Feng'e, and Wang Fulin and his wife Zhao Aimei, as the couples in the play. After such performances by "real men, real women, and real couples," they slowly became able to freely assign roles to men and women. Now, many drama troupes in the Xuchang Special District are very accustomed to freely switching roles.

Rural drama troupes are not only farmers' "self-performing and self-entertaining" cultural activities, but also have become a powerful weapon for them to carry out propaganda and education and promote central work. When the work of district and township cadres is hindered, they mobilize the village drama troupe to solve the problem, and every drama performance produces immediate results. For example, taking the village drama troupe in Jia County as an example, during the production increase movement, they wrote a play called "Guarantee to Produce 10% More Grain," which was watched by tens of thousands of people and had a great impact. Originally, some women who were "afraid of being ugly" when going to the fields to produce realized the glory of labor production. Wang Suozhi's wife Sisi and Wang Huagui's wife Liu Miao, who used to be unwilling to go to the fields, went to hoe and pick up manure the day after the play; Wang Bingyin's wife Guan'e, who used to be very feudal-minded and unwilling to go to the people's school, locked herself in her room and danced Yangko all night after watching the "Family Propaganda" performed by the village drama troupe, and entered the people's school the next day; during the army expansion movement, initially the masses had concerns about joining the army, they performed "Joining the Army to Avenge" and "Zhang San Jumps into the Well," and the number of people who signed up to join the army increased significantly the next day. Examples like this are too numerous to mention. Because the village drama troupe can combine with the central work of each period and solve the difficulties in work, some township cadres who originally "despised" the rural drama troupe have also changed their views and attitudes.

The performance forms in rural drama troupes are mostly Henan Clapper Opera and Henan Opera. From the perspective of drama form, they are the same as the old dramas in the city. However, the path they are taking today is completely different from the "slow reform" in the city. Because rural poverty reached its extreme before liberation, and they were isolated from drama for many years, the drama troupes they rebuilt today after being emancipated are brand new, and their first requirement is new content. Gorky once said: "Comrade workers look at literature and art straightforwardly to see whether you politically agree with them or oppose them." Today's peasants are the same. They are not as "magnanimous" as the urban citizenry towards feudal dramas with "lords," "imperial decree holders," "young masters," and "young ladies" as the protagonists. A drama troupe in Lushan County went from the city to the countryside to perform. At first, they said they would perform "Li Zicheng Enters Beijing," and the peasants were very happy and ran to watch, but in fact, they were performing the old play "Emperor Chongzhen Forces Himself to Death at Coal Hill," singing Emperor Chongzhen as a good emperor and Li Zicheng as a "rebel." When the song reached the point where Emperor Chongzhen stroked the table and cried bitterly, "I can't bear to part with my good people," the order under the stage could not be maintained, and the peasants demanded that they be expelled from the area. Some backward actors sang some low-level, vulgar lyrics on the stage, and the peasants raised their hands high and shouted from the stage: "I have an opinion for you, it's best to sing less of such bad words." Obviously, this force of mass supervision will overwhelmingly converge on the city, forcing the city's drama reform to speed up.

According to our preliminary investigation, many rural drama troupes have been able to write their own scripts. Most of the dramas they write are based on the central work tasks, combined with real people and events in the local area, and pieced together sentence by sentence during meals or production breaks. Because there are few people who can write, they often record a general outline without legs or arms. Some don't even have a record, so after the performance, the task is completed, and the script also disappears without a trace, without the opportunity to be sorted and revised, so that many works that once played a significant role in the movement are lost to the people as they bloom and wither on their own. In addition, due to lack of guidance, many errors and problems have arisen in terms of policy or the performance effect of the drama. For example, the "Zhang San Jumps into the Well" written by the Sufensi Drama Troupe in Jia County described the burning and killing of the Japanese invaders in the first half, which was very moving, but the second half described the Eighth Route Army liberating the village and shooting the captured Japanese, which was not in line with the Eighth Route Army's policy on prisoners during the Anti-Japanese War; another example is Wang Hulin, a model in the local mutual aid group. They wrote a "Wang Hulin Mutual Aid Group" based on his story. Because they didn't know how to cut the story and focus on the performance, they moved all the materials to the stage, resulting in a performance that lasted three nights. The masses watched and said: "The meaning is good, but it's not like a play. It's better to go to Wang Hulin's house to watch." Such examples can be found in every village drama troupe in every place. This shows that such a mighty army of peasant literature and art is generally fighting without command, and is blooming and withering on its own like wildflowers all over the mountains and valleys.

Currently, land reform in Henan has been fully completed, and land reform in the entire Central South Region will also be fully completed within next year. Obviously, rural drama troupes will appear in greater numbers day by day with the completion of the entire rural social reform and with the development of the entire cultural popularization movement. How to consolidate and improve them on the existing basis has become an urgent task. The government's cultural authorities and various literary and artistic organizations should take great efforts to undertake the guidance of rural drama troupes, so that the creation of the broad masses of peasants can grow well, and that this mighty literary and artistic team can become a strong supply force, like the rural militia.

    蓬勃发展中的河南农村剧团
　 李蕤
    编者按：从这篇文章可以看出土地改革后农
    民如何迫切需要新的戏剧，而唾弃旧内容的戏
    剧；他们的业余演剧活动已形成一股多么大的
    新的力量，需要加以有力的支持和指导。这是
    值得各级文化主管部门和专业戏剧团体、戏剧
    工作者十分重视的。
    随着土地改革的完成，河南的农村剧团，蓬勃生长并不断发展。许多地方，在斗争的果实刚刚到手，准备大生产的时候，群众就注意他们自己的文化娱乐，开始动手恢复或建立他们的村剧团了。特别是去年抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大运动轰轰烈烈地展开之后，农村剧团已经成为农村宣传大军中一支十分雄厚的力量。
    许昌专区，是河南土地改革最早的地区，根据今年七八月份的调查，农村剧团已经有一千七百多个。据陈留专区的调查，平均每个乡都有一个农村剧团。另据洛阳一个县的调查，比较正规的村剧团四十五个，不正规的有三十五个。把土地改革完成较早和土地改革完成较晚的地区放在一起计算，全省十个专区两个市的村剧团，数目在一万以上。
    因为全省土地改革迟早的不同，各地区经济条件的不同，村剧团原基础的不同，所以它的发展情况也是不平衡的。在先进地区（例如许昌专区），许多农村剧团已经有很好的服装乐器，有严整的组织，而在条件困难的地区（如大别山中），还有些是披着被单子缠着白毛巾就算是戏装的。但，有一点却是共同的，就是：群众热爱自己的剧团。每一个农村剧团的演出，附近的群众都翻山越岭去听。
    关于剧团演员的成分，也因为整个地区的条件不同而有很大的差别。像许昌专区，一般地说，“村剧团”已经被干部和群众看成很神圣的宣传队伍，作风不正派的历史有问题的人不准参加。剧团里的成员是党团员，民兵，妇女积极分子，乡村小学教师，进步的民间艺人共同组织起来的农村文艺统一阵线。只有条件较差的地区，还有少数二流子存在。
    在经费方面，也不一致，因为没有固定的经费来源，有些是从斗争的果实里“拔”出来的，有些是剧团的团员们自己掏腰包乐捐的，也有些是群众自愿凑起来的。但更多的是从增产中来想办法，像郑州专区的木楼乡，村剧团没有经费，团员们就合伙给花纱布公司打包，一两天便解决了全部困难。
    农村剧团，大半是从秧歌队的基础上发展起来的，最初是翻身了，扭起秧歌来高兴高兴，后来觉得“不够味”，就搬到舞台上去。一般的最初成立时，都是只有男演员或只有女演员，演出的时候男扮女或者女扮男；到第二阶段，是真夫妇扮演剧中的夫妇，譬如郏县苏坟寺的剧团，在演“翻身乐”的时候，就是由农民王福乾和他的女人贾凤蛾两口、王福林和他的女人赵爱梅两口，扮演戏中的夫妻。经过这样“真男真女真两口”演出之后，慢慢便能男女自由配角。现在，许昌专区的许多剧团，已经很习惯于自由串角了。
    农村剧团不仅是农民“自演自乐”的文娱活动，而且已经成为他们进行宣传教育、推动中心工作的有力武器。区乡干部，在他们的工作受到阻碍的时候，便动员村剧团来解决问题，每一次剧演出以后，就产生立竿见影的效果。譬如以郏县的村剧团为例，在增产运动中他们自己编了一出戏叫“保证多打一成粮”，演出的时候，几万人去看，起了很大的影响。原来有些妇女下地生产“怕丑”的都认识了劳动生产的光荣。苏坟寺村王索志的女人丝丝，王华贵的女人刘苗等，从前不肯下地，在演戏的第二天就下地锄地拾粪；王丙寅的女人关蛾，从前思想很封建，不肯上民校，看了村剧团上演的“家庭宣传”后，当夜就闩着门自己在屋里扭秧歌，第二天便进了民校；在扩军运动中，最初群众对参军有顾虑，他们演了“参军报仇”和“张三投井”，第二天报名参军的人便增加了许多。诸如此类的例子，举不胜举。因为村剧团能结合每一时期的中心工作，能解决工作上的困难，所以有些原来对农村剧团“轻视”的乡干部们，也都改变了自己的看法和态度。
    农村剧团里的演出形式，多半是河南梆子和河南曲子，从戏剧形式来说，和城市里的旧戏剧是一样的。但是，他们今天所走的道路，却和城市里的“缓步改革”完全不同。由于解放前农村贫困达于极点，多少年就和戏剧绝缘，所以今天他们翻身以后重建的剧团是崭新的，他们第一个是要求新的内容。高尔基曾经说过：“工人同志对于文艺，是率直地看你在政治上是赞成他或反对他，”今天的农民，也是如此。对那些以“老爷”“诰命”“公子”“小姐”为主角的封建戏，他们不像城市的市民层那样“宽宏大量”。鲁山县一个剧团，从城里到乡下演戏，最先说演“闯王进京”，农民很高兴都跑去看，但实际上他演的却是老戏“崇祯逼死煤山”，把崇祯唱成好皇帝，把李闯王唱成“反贼”，当唱到崇祯皇帝抚案痛哭“舍不了我的好百姓”的时候，台下便维持不住秩序，农民们纷纷要求驱逐他们出境。有些落后演员，在台上唱些低级趣味的色情的唱词，农民就在台下高高举起手来喊道：“我给你提个意见，这样的坏话最好少唱。”很显然，这个群众的监督力量，将排山倒海地汇向城市，使城市的戏剧改革不得不放快脚步。
    根据我们的初步调查，许多农村剧团已经能够自己编剧本。他们所编的剧，大半是根据中心工作任务，结合当地的真人真事，在吃饭或生产休息时你一句我一句凑成的；因为会写字的人少，往往少腿没胳膊地记个大路数，有些就连记录也没有，所以演过以后，任务完了，剧本也无影无踪，没有获得整理修改的机会，以致有许多在运动中曾起过不小作用的作品，都自开自谢地散失民间。另外，也由于缺乏指导，在政策上或戏剧的演出效果上，产生不少错误和问题。譬如郏县苏坟寺剧团编的“张三投井”，前半段是描写日寇的烧杀的，很感动人，后半段描写八路军解放了那个村子，把俘掳了的日本人枪毙，这便和抗日时期八路军的俘虏政策不符合；另如当地有个搞互助组的模范王胡林，他们根据他的故事编了个“王胡林互助组”，因为不会剪裁故事，集中表现，就把全部材料都搬上舞台，结果一下演了三个晚上。群众看了说：“意思是好，就是不像戏。这样看还不如跑到王胡林家去看呢。”这样的例子，每一个地方的村剧团都可以找到。这说明，这样一个浩浩荡荡的农民文艺大军，一般地说还是没有指挥地在作战，还像满山遍谷的野花一样在自开自谢。
    目前，河南的土地改革已经全部完成了，整个中南区的土地改革，明年内也将全部完成，很显然，农村剧团将随着整个农村社会改革的完成，随着整个文化普及运动的发展，一天比一天更大量地出现，如何在现有的基础上巩固他们并提高他们，已成为刻不容缓的工作。政府文化主管机关和各文艺团体，应以大力来担负农村剧团的辅导或指导工作，使广大农民群众的创作能够很好地生长起来，使这个浩浩荡荡的文艺队伍，能够像农村的民兵一样，成为一个雄厚的补给力量。
