　　Classic Works Should Be Annotated
    Comrade Editor: The book "On the Shortcomings in Party Work and Measures for Eliminating the Trotskyist Double-Dealers and Other Double-Dealers" by Stalin, recently published by the People's Publishing House, is worthy of serious study by each of our cadres. However, I believe that in the future, when publishing such classic works, the publishing house should add necessary annotations to events, figures, etc., that are unfamiliar to general readers. In this way, readers can better appreciate the content of the book.
    Regarding the annotation of classic works, we have many examples to learn from. For example, the annotation work of the "Selected Works of Lenin" published by the Soviet Foreign Languages Publishing House and the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" edited by the Editorial Committee of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong of the CPC Central Committee are very good examples.

　　对于经典著作应加注释
    编辑同志：最近人民出版社出版的斯大林著的“论党工作底缺点和消灭托洛茨基两面分子及其他两面分子的办法”一书，是值得我们每个干部认真学习的。但我认为该社今后在出版这类经典著作时，应对其中为一般读者所不熟悉的事件、人物等，加以必要的注释。这样，就使读者对该书内容能更好的体会。
    关于经典著作的注释工作，我们是有着不少榜样可以学习的。如苏联外国文书籍出版局出版的“列宁文选”、中共中央毛泽东选集出版委员会编辑的“毛泽东选集”的注释工作，就是很好的范例。
