(I)
Since the Berlin meeting of the World Peace Council, major new developments have occurred in Asia. This is the recent signing of the separate peace treaty with Japan and the US-Japan Security Treaty in San Francisco.

Truman and Acheson shamelessly declared that, thanks to this treaty, Japan can restore its sovereignty and return to the free international community as an independent nation, which is the way to strengthen world peace. Prime Minister Yoshida praised it as a "generous peace." However, the content of the US-made separate treaty is anti-Soviet, anti-China, and against the national liberation of Asia. As the world knows, this is a major link in the US imperialist policy of aggression in Asia. All the situations that have developed in Asia now clearly prove this.

US imperialism's aggression in Asia is no longer just a plan on paper. This aggression has been carried out in Korea for the past year. Faced with the power of the world's peace-loving people, the US government was forced to agree to hold Korean armistice negotiations. However, on the other hand, it attempted to undermine these negotiations while forcing countries to sign the treaty with Japan. At the same time, the economic, political, and military dominance of US imperialism extends to the Philippines and Taiwan, of course, and also to Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries, although to varying degrees. Moreover, simultaneously with the signing of the peace treaty with Japan, it also concluded the so-called US, Australia, and New Zealand Security Treaty, the US-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty, and the US-Japan Security Treaty. This itself shows that this is to create an aggressive military alliance in the Pacific similar to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

(II)
The separate peace treaty with Japan not only threatens the nations of Asia, but also establishes foreign rule over the Japanese nation that the Japanese nation has never suffered before.

Why? Because according to the treaty and the US-Japan Security Treaty, the US government can station troops in Japan for a long time after the peace and build military bases at will. It can allow US troops to freely conduct exercises and freely mobilize troops in Japan's territory, airspace, and territorial waters, and suppress Japan's national liberation democratic revolution.

This military rule also means political and economic control over Japan. The treaty and the security treaty are nothing more than to legitimize this comprehensive control over Japan. It deprives the Japanese nation of freedom, democracy, and the prospect of peaceful development.

Most of Japan's national finances are used for US military stationing expenses, military base construction costs, and rearming Japan. Industries are forced to expand military industries according to US requirements. Peaceful industries that guarantee the people's livelihood are squeezed out. Moreover, military factories are strictly limited to repairing US-made weapons or manufacturing parts. Overall, Japanese industry lacks independence and is gradually becoming like Latin America. It puts Japan in an openly hostile relationship with the Soviet Union and China, isolating it among the nations of Asia. It also deprives Japan of the opportunity to trade freely with countries around the world and exchange culture. What the treaty guarantees to the Japanese people is: under the predatory exploitation of US monopoly capital and the excessive profits of Japanese monopoly capital, it forces extreme currency inflation, increased taxes, reduced workers' wages, unemployment and hunger, poverty and disease.

However, here I must emphasize that the signing of the treaty is forming a combination of US imperialism and Japanese militarism, creating an unprecedented fascist rule over the Japanese nation.

US imperialism's rule over other nations is even worse than that of Japanese militarism or Hitler's fascism. The example of Korea is enough to illustrate this well. This is a political system of unprecedented brutal suppression and slaughter. US imperialism is already using the Emperor system as a spiritual pillar to restore militarism and establish this brutal rule over the Japanese nation. The Japanese traitor Yoshida government is undertaking the task of slaughtering the Japanese nation itself. In order to welcome the signing of the treaty, they lifted the purge of more than 100,000 Japanese war criminals. On the other hand, they have imprisoned more than 6,000 communists, progressives, and peace fighters, and arrested Japanese Communist Party cadres without reason. They banned the publication of more than 1,800 progressive newspapers. They also suppressed peaceful signatures and peaceful gatherings with armed police. The Yoshida government is already carrying out a plan to rebuild an army of 300,000 to 500,000 Japanese troops after the peace, and is planning to restore the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Special Higher Police (Note: Japanese "thought police," i.e., secret agents), which were considered the source of the Japanese police state and were banned by the Far Eastern Commission, and to rebuild a police force far stronger than before the war. It is planning "public security regulations" to ensure its unrestricted suppression, arrest, and execution of the people.

(III)
It is only natural that people from many strata of Japanese society have risen up to oppose such a US-made separate treaty more strongly.

The Comprehensive Peace and Patriotic Movement Council, organized by Japanese progressive workers, farmers, scientists, cultural figures, and other groups, sent a petition to the San Francisco Conference in early September on behalf of more than five million Japanese people who signed against rearmament and demanded a comprehensive peace, declaring that Shigeru Yoshida cannot represent the will of the Japanese people and that any treaty he signs is invalid and the Japanese people will never recognize the treaty he signed. Before the San Francisco Conference was held, 40,000 people in Tokyo held a people's protest rally on September 1, despite the suppression.

Before the Berlin meeting of the World Peace Council, Japan established the aforementioned Comprehensive Peace and Patriotic Movement organization in January of this year. The resolutions of the Berlin meeting further stimulated this movement. The signature campaign for the Peace Covenant Declaration also began. This Patriotic Movement Council and the Japan Peace Supporters Committee are united as one and lead the Japanese peace movement. This movement has now developed into a surging national movement. The scale of this movement is directly reflected in: breaking through brutal obstruction, by the end of September, the Peace Covenant Declaration had been signed by 5.8 million people. Thousands of local peace committees have been established throughout the country.

The first characteristic of the Japanese peace movement, which has become a national movement, is that the peace movement is carried out under increasingly rampant fascist suppression. In mid-July, several hundred youth workers, farmers, women, and students representing 250 youth groups across the country held the Japan National Youth Representatives Peace Conference in Tokyo. At that time, although it was subjected to armed suppression by the Japanese police, it was able to complete the meeting by using clever tactics. On August 15, the anniversary of the surrender of Japanese imperialism, on this day alone, mass peace gatherings were held in more than 40 places across the country, 20 of which were met with suppression by armed police. The National Peace Congress was held in Tokyo from August 14 to 18. This conference was also able to break through the suppression by using clever mobile tactics. Despite these difficulties, the conference still passed a resolution calling on the leaders of the five major powers to conclude a peace covenant and other important resolutions.

The second characteristic is that almost all of Japan's trade union organizations have participated in the peace movement. Not to mention the progressive trade unions, even the National Railway Workers' Union, the National Telecommunications Workers' Union, and the Teachers' Union, the largest trade unions in Japan under the influence of the Socialist Party, as well as the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, which these trade unions are composed of, rejected the policy of separate peace and rearmament supported by the reactionary cadres, and resolved to demand a comprehensive peace and oppose rearmament. At the appeal of religious groups, the General Council organized the "Japan National Conference for Promoting Peace" on July 28 and began a signature campaign against rearmament and military agreements. The cadres of the Socialist Party system who led this movement attempted to use this movement to alienate the growing Japanese peace movement. However, the masses under their influence seriously participated in the peace movement.

The third characteristic is that Japan's peace movement is gradually absorbing more intellectuals, scholars, cultural figures, religious figures, and other strata of people. Japanese Buddhists recently organized the Religious Circles Peace Movement Council and participated in the peace movement. Scholars and intellectuals have always been passive about this type of activity. But this time, they themselves came to the streets, attended mass gatherings, and promoted the struggle for peace and independence. Fifty-six famous Japanese philosophers, religious figures, artists, etc. sent a letter to the chairman of the San Francisco Conference opposing the signing of the separate treaty. Tokyo University President Shigeru Nanbara issued a painful statement on the day the treaty was signed, saying: "This day is a day when all Japanese citizens should wear mourning clothes." Amid such angry protests from the Japanese people, the Yoshida government had to stop all the celebration plans it had originally scheduled for the day of signing.

Although the US-made separate treaty with Japan was signed regardless of this anger of the Japanese people, the voices of non-recognition of the treaty are now overflowing in Japanese cities, villages, factories, and schools, and leaflets of protest are being distributed in the streets. Various democratic groups have issued declarations to the people at home and abroad to launch a struggle against the treaty. Trade unions are preparing for strike struggles.

(IV)
Although the separate peace treaty with Japan has been signed, it does not indicate the consolidation of US imperialism's position in Japan, but rather the first step in its collapse. Because this illegal and unjust treaty not only further strengthens the Japanese nation's resistance to US imperialism, but also strengthens the resistance of all Asian nations and peace-loving people around the world. US imperialism is bound to fall into complete isolation in the world. The Soviet Union, China, the Eastern European People's Democracies, plus India and Burma, countries that account for more than 60% of the world's population, have refused to sign the San Francisco Treaty. This fact eloquently illustrates this.

The inspiration that the Japanese nation has received from this fact is immeasurable. Moreover, US imperialism has already been resisted by the people of the world in Korea and has suffered political and military defeat. This fact has further consolidated the Japanese nation's confidence in victory.

Based on this situation, I want to tell the people of the world the will and hope of the Japanese people who are now at a critical juncture in the life and death of the nation. This hope is: the Japanese nation, which demands peace and independence, is determined to crush the treacherous treaty and security treaty, and is determined to fight with all its strength for a comprehensive treaty that is the only way for the nation to survive. At the same time, it also expects assistance from all peace-loving people around the world.

Accordingly, for the sake of the Japanese nation, I make the following declaration:

The Japanese nation absolutely does not recognize a war treaty that antagonizes the Soviet Union, China, and the nations of Asia.

The Japanese nation absolutely does not recognize a treaty that makes Japan a permanent colony of US imperialism.

The Japanese nation absolutely does not recognize this treaty that restores Japanese militarism stained with the blood of Asian nations and once again makes the Japanese nation a cannon fodder for aggressive wars.

The Japanese nation resolutely demands a comprehensive treaty that guarantees the Japanese nation a free, democratic, and peaceful future.

Finally, based on the principle that world problems should be resolved through peaceful negotiations rather than war, the Japanese nation further warmly supports the movement to demand that the five major powers conclude a peace covenant and the demand for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. The threat of a new war is deepening all the time. We oppose the arms race that is already destroying the lives of people in various countries, and especially oppose the rearmament of Japan and West Germany, which is an important part of this race. Moreover, we advocate that peace policy must be based on the disarmament proposed by the World Peace Council, and we agree with this proposal.

    日本民族坚决要粉碎卖国性的和约
    ——日本代表富泽宏在世界和平理事会三日会议上的发言
    （一）
    自从世界和平理事会柏林会议以后，在亚洲又发生了重大的新情况。这就是最近在旧金山签订了单独对日和约和美日安全条约。
    杜鲁门和艾奇逊恬不知耻地声称：由于这个和约，日本能够恢复主权，重新以独立国家的身份回到自由的国际社会里来，这就是加强世界和平的道路。吉田首相歌颂说：这是“宽大的媾和”。然而美制单独和约的内容是反对苏联、反对中国、反对亚洲民族解放的。世所周知，这是美帝国主义侵略亚洲政策的主要环节。现在在亚洲所发展的一切局势清楚地证明了这件事。
    美帝国主义侵略亚洲已经不仅是纸上的计划了。这一年来，这种侵略已经在朝鲜实行了。美国政府在世界爱好和平人民的力量面前，被迫同意举行朝鲜停战谈判。但是，另一方面，它又企图破坏这一谈判，同时并强迫各国在对日和约上签字。同时，美帝国主义在经济上、政治上、军事上的统治势力，在菲律宾、台湾当然不用多说，也伸展到越南、泰国、印尼等东南亚各国，虽然在程度上有所不同。而且在与签订对日和约的同时，还缔结了所谓美国、澳大利亚和新西兰三国安全条约、美菲联防条约以及美日安全条约。这件事本身就说明了：这是为了要在太平洋造成一个和北大西洋公约类似的侵略性军事同盟。
    （二）    对日单独和约不仅威胁亚洲各民族，而且对日本民族建立了日本民族所从来未曾遭受过的异族统治。
    为什么呢？因为美国政府根据和约和美日安全条约，能够在媾和以后长期驻军日本，并且任意建设军事基地。它能够在日本的领土、领空、领海使美军自由演习，自由调动军队，并可以镇压日本的民族解放民主革命。
    这个军事统治同时也意味着对日本政治、经济的统治。和约和安全条约不外乎是为了使这种对日本的全面统治合法化。它剥夺了日本民族的自由、民主、和平发展的前途。
    日本的国家财政大部分都用于美军驻扎费、军事基地建筑费、重新武装日本的费用上了。产业是按照美国的要求，被迫扩大军事工业。保证国民生活的和平产业都被挤倒了。而且军事工厂是被严格限制于专门修理美制武器或者制造零件。整个说来，日本产业是没有独立性的，逐渐变得和拉丁美洲一样。它使日本对苏联和中国公开站在敌对的关系上，在亚洲各民族中孤立起来。它并剥夺了日本和世界各国间自由通商和交流文化的机会。和约保证给予日本国民的是：在美国垄断资本掠夺性的剥削和日本垄断资本获得超额利润的条件下，迫使通货极度膨胀、增税、降低工人的工资、造成失业和饥饿、贫困和疾病。
    然而这里我必须强调的是：和约的签订正在形成美帝国主义和日本军国主义的结合，造成对日本民族空前未有的法西斯统治。
    美帝国主义对其他民族的统治更甚于日本军国主义或希特勒的法西斯统治。朝鲜的实例就足以很好地说明这一点。这是史无前例的残酷镇压和屠杀的政治。美帝国主义对日本民族已经在利用天皇制作为精神上的支柱，恢复军国主义而建立它这种残酷统治。日本的卖国贼吉田政府，正在承担由它自己来屠杀日本民族的任务。他们为了迎接和约的签字，对十多万名日本战犯解除整肃。另一方面，他们已经把六千多名共产主义者、进步人士、和平战士关进了监狱，并毫无理由地逮捕日本共产党干部。他们禁止一千八百多种进步报纸出版。他们并以武装警察镇压和平签名与和平集会。吉田政府已经在进行在媾和后重建三十万至五十万日本军队的计划，并在计划恢复被远东委员会认为是日本警察国家的渊薮而加以禁止的内务省和特高（按系日本的“思想警察”，即特务），和重建远超过战前的强大警察力量。它正在筹划着“治安条例”，以保证它对人民施行无限制的镇压、逮捕和处以极刑。
    （三）
    日本许多阶层的人民起来更强烈地反对这样的美制单独和约，是理所当然的。
    日本的进步工人、农民、科学家、文化人等团体组织的全面媾和爱国运动协议会，在九月初代表签名反对重新武装和要求全面媾和的五百万以上的日本人民，向旧金山会议送致请愿书，声明吉田茂不能代表日本人民的意志，他所签字的任何条约都是无效的，日本人民决不承认他所签订的条约。在旧金山会议举行以前，东京有四万人不顾镇压，在九月一日举行了人民抗议大会。
    在世界和平理事会柏林会议以前，日本在今年一月就成立了上述的全面媾和爱国运动的组织。柏林会议的各项决议更进一步地刺激了这个运动。和平公约宣言的签名运动也开始了。这个爱国运动协议会和日本的拥护和平委员会团结如同一个整体，领导日本的和平运动。这一运动现在发展为澎湃的民族运动了。这一运动的规模直接表现在：突破了残暴的阻挠，到九月底为止，和平公约宣言签名已达五百八十万人。全国成立了一千数百个地区和平委员会。
    这个发展成为民族运动的日本和平运动的第一个特征是：和平运动是在越来越狂妄的法西斯镇压下进行的。七月中旬，代表全国二百五十个青年团体的五百数十名青年工人、农民、妇女、学生在东京举行了日本全国青年代表和平会议。那时虽受日本警察队的武装镇压，但是应用了巧妙的战术，终于能够把会议开完。日本帝国主义投降纪念日，即八月十五日，仅只在这一天之内，全国有四十处以上的地方召开了群众性的和平集会，其中有二十处遭遇了武装警察的镇压。八月十四日至十八日在东京举行了全国和平大会。这个大会也是用巧妙的移动战术，终于能够突破镇压。尽管有这样的困难，大会还是通过了向五大国领袖要求缔结和平公约以及其他重要决议。
    第二个特征是：日本全国的工会组织几乎全部参加了和平运动。进步工会不用说了，连社会党影响下的国营铁道工人工会、全国递信（邮电）工会、教职员工会等日本最大的工会以及这些工会所组成的日本工会总评议会，都拒绝了反动干部所拥护的单独媾和与重新武装的政策，而决议要求全面缔和、反对重新武装。总评议会由于宗教团体的呼吁，在七月二十八日组织了“日本推进和平国民会议”，开始了反对重新武装和军事协定的签名运动。领导这个运动的社会党系统的干部，为要离间日益壮大的日本和平运动，企图利用这个运动。然而他们影响下的群众却认真地参加了和平运动。
    第三个特征是：日本的和平运动逐渐更多地吸收知识分子、学者、文化人、宗教家等各阶层的人。日本的佛教徒最近组织了宗教界和平运动协议会，参加了和平运动。学者、知识分子一向对这种活动是消极的。但这一次他们自己来到街头，出席群众集会，宣传为争取和平和独立的斗争。日本著名的哲学家、宗教家、艺术家等五十六人，向旧金山会议的主席送致反对签订单独和约的信。东京大学校长南原繁在和约签字那天发表了悲痛的声明说：“这一天是日本全体国民应该穿孝的日子。”吉田政府在日本人民这样愤怒的抗议中，不得不停止它原订在签字日举行的一切庆祝计划。
    美制对日单独和约虽然不顾日本人民的这种激怒而签订了，然而现在日本的都市、农村、工厂、学校都洋溢着不承认和约的呼声，在街头散发着抗议的传单。各民主团体向国内外的人民发出展开反对和约的斗争的宣言。工会在准备着罢工斗争。
    （四）
    对日单独和约虽然签了字，但是它不是说明美帝国主义在日本的地位的巩固，而是说明这是它崩溃的第一步。因为这个非法而且非正义的和约不仅更加加强日本民族对美帝国主义的抵抗，并且也加强全亚洲各民族和爱好和平的全世界人民的抵抗。美帝国主义在世界上势必陷于完全孤立。苏联、中国、东欧人民民主国家，再加上印度、缅甸，占全世界人口的百分之六十以上的国家已经拒绝在旧金山和约上签字。这一事实雄辩地说明了这件事。
    日本民族由于这个事实得到的鼓舞，是不可限量的。而且美帝国主义已经在朝鲜受到世界人民的抵抗，在政治上、军事上遭到失败。这一事实使日本民族的胜利信心更加巩固起来。
    我要根据这种形势，向全世界人民诉说现在正处在民族生死关头的日本人民的意志和希望。这希望就是：要求和平和独立的日本民族坚决要粉碎卖国性的和约和安全条约，决心为争取是民族生存的唯一道路的全面和约而全力奋斗。同时也期望全世界爱好和平的人们予以援助。
    据此，我为了日本民族作以下的宣言：
    日本民族绝对不承认以苏联、中国、亚洲各民族为敌的战争和约。
    日本民族绝对不承认使日本成为美帝国主义永久殖民地的和约。
    日本民族绝对不承认这个恢复沾染亚洲各民族的血的日本军国主义、再度使日本民族充当侵略战争的炮灰的和约。
    日本民族坚决要求对日本民族保证有自由、民主、和平的发展前途的全面和约。
    最后，日本民族根据世界的问题不以战争来解决而以和平谈判来解决的原则，更进一步热烈拥护要求五大国缔结和平公约的运动及和平解决朝鲜问题的要求。新战争的威胁是时时刻刻地在加深。我们反对已经在破坏各国人民生活的军备竞赛，特别反对在这竞赛中成为重要部分的日本及西德的重整军备。并且，我们主张：和平政策必须以世界和平理事会提议的裁减军备为基础，我们同意这个提议。
