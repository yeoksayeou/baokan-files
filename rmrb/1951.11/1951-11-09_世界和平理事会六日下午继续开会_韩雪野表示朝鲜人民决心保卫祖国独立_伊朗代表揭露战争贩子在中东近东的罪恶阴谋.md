Xinhua News Agency, Vienna dispatch from TASS: The World Peace Council continued its meeting on the afternoon of the 6th, presided over by Fiaho (Brazil). The first speaker at the meeting was Canadian representative, MacBaugh. He explained to the Council how the Canadian people are resisting American war propaganda, and emphatically pointed out: Any persecution of peace fighters cannot separate Canada from the powerful forces of the world peace movement.

Representatives and guests welcomed Han Xueye, the representative of the heroic Korean people, with warm and prolonged applause. Han Xueye said: The Korean people are standing at the forefront of the struggle for peace. They are defending the freedom, honor, and independence of their motherland. The American imperialists who launched aggression in Korea have not and never will be able to thwart the will of the freedom-loving Korean people. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have inflicted one blow after another on the invading forces and the Lee Seung-man army. Han Xueye said: The American plan to invade Korea is bound to fail.

The meeting warmly welcomed Iranian representative, Homos. He exposed the so-called Middle East "Defense Pact" plan as a sinister conspiracy aimed at opposing world peace and the independence of countries in the Middle East and Near East. Homos said: The Iranian people are deeply convinced that no matter what conspiracies the warmongers carry out, the people of the Near East and Middle East will never allow their countries to become aggressive bases for attacking the Soviet Union.

After Homos's speech, the afternoon meeting adjourned.
