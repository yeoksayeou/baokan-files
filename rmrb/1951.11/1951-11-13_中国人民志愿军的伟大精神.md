International Short Commentary:

　　To aid Korean refugees suffering from the atrocities of the American and Syngman Rhee troops, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has once again enthusiastically launched a movement to conserve and donate resources on the front lines to help the Korean people. At the same time, many commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, braving enemy artillery fire and aircraft threats, diligently assist the Korean people with the autumn harvest. One unit of the Volunteer Army alone saved and donated a large amount of grain, enough to feed all the refugees in the area where the unit is stationed for two months. This fact fully demonstrates the lofty internationalist spirit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.
    The great spirit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, which regards the suffering of the Korean people as its own, profoundly illustrates the close relationship between the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean people, a relationship as close as brothers and sisters and as intimate as flesh and blood. It also shows that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is a righteous army fighting to relieve the Korean people from disaster. Because of this, the Korean people love the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, treating them as their own family. Although they have suffered enormous losses under the burning, killing, and looting of the American invaders, they still use all their strength to assist the Volunteer Army in combat. The unbreakable unity between the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is the source of the invincible strength of the Sino-Korean people's forces.
    The Korean people, the Chinese people, and the people of the world all know how cruelly and barbarously the American aggressor's army treats the Korean people. The Korean and Chinese people will forever remember the blood debts of the more than 72,000 people massacred by the American invaders in Seoul, the blood debts of 170,000 people in Hwanghae and Pyongan provinces, and the blood debts of thousands upon thousands of good people throughout Korea. The Korean and Chinese people will also forever remember who turned Korea's beautiful and peaceful land into a barren battlefield. This deep blood feud has aroused the boundless anger of the Chinese and Korean people, thereby strengthening the unity between the Chinese and Korean people.
    The righteous actions of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army educate all the Chinese people to carry out the movement of increasing production and practicing economy with the same spirit of hard work, to strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, and to support our glorious People's Volunteer Army.

　　中国人民志愿军的伟大精神
    为了救济遭受美李匪军残害的朝鲜难民，中国人民志愿军再一次在前线踊跃地展开了救济朝鲜人民的节约捐献运动。同时，中国人民志愿军的很多指挥员、战斗员冒着敌人炮火和飞机的威胁，辛勤地帮助朝鲜人民秋收。仅志愿军某部就节约捐献了大量粮食，足供该部驻地所有难民两个月的食用。这一事实充分表现了中国人民志愿军的崇高的国际主义精神。
    中国人民志愿军这种把朝鲜人民的苦难当作自己的苦难的伟大精神，深刻地说明了中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民亲如手足、形同骨肉的关系。同时也说明了中国人民志愿军是为解救朝鲜人民的灾难而战的正义的军队。正因为如此，朝鲜人民才热爱中国人民志愿军，他们把志愿军当作自己的亲人一样看待。虽然他们在美国侵略者烧杀抢掠之下，遭受了巨大的损失，但是仍以自己所有的力量来协助志愿军作战。朝鲜人民与中国人民志愿军间牢不可破的团结，是中朝人民部队不可战胜的力量的泉源。
    朝鲜人民、中国人民以及全世界的人民都知道，美国侵略者的军队是怎样残酷地、野蛮地对待朝鲜人民的。朝中人民将永远记得被美国侵略者惨杀的汉城七万二千余人民的血债、黄海、平原两道十七万人的血债以及全朝鲜成千成万善良人民的血债。朝中人民也将永远记得是谁将朝鲜美丽、和平的土地变成荒芜的战场。这种血海深仇激发了中朝人民无比的愤怒，从而更加强了中朝人民的团结。
    中国人民志愿军的正义行动，教育着全体中国人民要以同样艰苦的精神，展开增产节约运动，加强抗美援朝工作，支援我们光荣的人民志愿军。
