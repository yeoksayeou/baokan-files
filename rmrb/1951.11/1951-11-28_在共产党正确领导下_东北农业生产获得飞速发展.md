Under the Correct Leadership of the Communist Party, Northeast China's Agricultural Production Has Developed Rapidly

By Our Special Correspondent Zhang Qingtai

Comrade Mao Zedong wrote in "On Coalition Government":

"The effect, good or bad, great or small, of the policy and practice of any Chinese political party upon the Chinese people depends ultimately on whether, and how much, they help to develop their productive forces, and on whether they are fettering or freeing these forces. The final elimination of Japanese aggressors, the implementation of land reform, the liberation of the peasants, the development of modern industry, and the establishment of an independent, free, democratic, united and prosperous New China – all these alone can ensure the liberation of the productive forces of Chinese society and are welcomed by the Chinese people."

According to this profound instruction of Comrade Mao Zedong, it is very meaningful and beneficial to study the role of the Communist Party's policies in developing agricultural productive forces in Northeast China.

I. Basic Situation of Economic Development in Northeast China's Rural Areas

Even during the most intense years of the War of Liberation, the Communist Party vigorously assisted the broad masses of peasants in Northeast China to carry out land reform. After the feudal relations of production in the countryside were thoroughly broken, the productive enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants was immediately unleashed. Especially after the liberation of the entire Northeast region in 1949, the Communist Party concentrated its efforts on leading economic construction, and agricultural productive forces were rapidly restored and developed. For example, the area of cultivated land in Northeast China was 17.86 million hectares in 1943, reduced to 13.14 million hectares in 1946, and basically fully restored in 1950. The number of draft animals was 4.27 million in 1943, decreased to 3.76 million in 1948, but has now greatly exceeded the number of draft animals in 1943. The total grain output in Northeast China in 1949 was 13.2 million tons, increasing to 18.08 million tons in 1950, an increase of 37%, reaching 99.48% of the pre-war peak level in 1943. The unit area yield per hectare increased from 1,615 jin in 1946 to 2,412 jin in 1950, exceeding the pre-war peak level in 1943 by 13.93%. Some counties have even exceeded the pre-war peak level in grain output. For example, in Shulan County, Jilin Province, the total output of the county in 1943 was 139,566 tons, but in 1950 it increased to 166,758 tons, exceeding 1943 by 19.48%.

With the development of industry and commerce, the sown area of industrial raw material crops has increased year by year. For cotton alone, it expanded by 97.3% in 1950 compared with 1949, and by another 91.9% in 1951 compared with 1950. The sown area of commercial grain crops has also increased year by year. For soybeans alone, it expanded by 28.17% in 1950 compared with 1949, and by another 6.47% in 1951 compared with 1950. The sideline production in the vast rural areas is also developing. For example, in Heilongjiang Province, the sales of local products and by-products in 1950 were equivalent to approximately 920,000 tons of grain, and the commercialized portion of local products and by-products in 1951 is estimated to be equivalent to 1.1 million tons of grain.

Due to the development of the rural economy, the purchasing power of peasants has also increased year by year, thus expanding the market for industrial products. The number of cloths sold by state-owned commercial enterprises in the entire Northeast region was 4 million bolts in 1949 and 9.02 million bolts in 1950; an increase of more than eleven times compared with 1947. The purchasing power of peasants in 1950 increased by approximately 33% compared with 1949. Taking cotton cloth alone, on average, ten people bought one bolt of cloth in 1949, while on average, four and a half people bought one bolt of cloth in 1950. In the first quarter of 1951, the total retail value of cooperatives, which mainly serve the rural areas in their business operations, increased by 38.1% compared with the same period in 1950. It should be pointed out that the retail sales of cooperatives account for only a little over 40% of the total rural social retail commodity turnover. The increase in peasants' purchasing power is prominently reflected in the increasing proportion of purchases of means of production year by year. According to a survey in Minzhu Village, Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, means of production accounted for only 10.7% of the total purchasing power in 1949, but had increased to 23% in the spring of 1950; in Yaobao Village, Hulan County, Songjiang Province, means of production accounted for 19% of the total purchasing power in 1949, increasing to 35.5% in 1950. The increasing proportion of peasants' need for means of production indicates the trend of peasants' demand for expanded reproduction.

At present, the basic characteristic of economic development in Northeast China's rural areas is that middle peasants have become the majority in the countryside. In the old liberated areas in the north, middle peasants account for approximately 60% to 70% of peasant households, while in the new liberated areas in the south, they account for over 50%. Among them, a small number of new-style rich peasants have emerged. Most poor peasants and farm laborers have risen to become middle peasants, and although the living standards of a small number of peasants are not as good as those of middle peasants, they have also improved to some extent. Those who have declined are only a small number of peasant households who are unable to maintain reproduction due to lack of labor, or due to illness and disasters, or due to lack of means of production and draft animals, or due to being fond of pleasure and lazy. In short, the basic trend of economic development in Northeast China's rural areas at present is that the vast majority of peasants are becoming increasingly prosperous.

II. The Party's Leadership and Policies in the Countryside

The rapid restoration and development of agricultural productive forces in Northeast China cannot be attributed solely to the implementation of land reform. As is well known, the peasant economy after land reform is basically a scattered, individual, small-scale peasant economy. As Stalin said, "It is an economy standing at the crossroads between capitalism and socialism. It can either develop towards capitalism, as is the case in capitalist countries now, or it can develop towards socialism, as will happen in our country under the dictatorship of the proletariat." ("Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction", Jiefang Publishing House edition, Volume II, page 38) The capitalist development path of the small-scale peasant economy is to undergo the most profound differentiation of peasants, with huge large estates at one extreme and widespread impoverishment at the other. Obviously, it is unnecessary to prove that the rural economy in Northeast China is not developing along the capitalist path, and it is also impossible for it to develop along this path. If, in general, the rural economy depends on the city, on industry, on the credit system, and on the nature of the state power, thus determining that the countryside will inevitably follow the city, then in our case, the city has a completely different face. Because here, urban industry is mainly in the hands of the working class, and the credit system and state power are under the leadership of the working class and its party. The basic policy of the working class and its party is to promote mutual assistance between urban and rural areas and to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. This determines that our rural economy can only advance along the path of New Democracy. How does the Communist Party continuously help the broad masses of peasants develop productive forces?

(1) Organizing to Become Prosperous

During the period of land reform and the War of Liberation, the means of production were scattered; due to frequent war mobilization, the rural labor force was relatively reduced; and the abandonment of cultivated land was very serious at that time. In order to ensure that no land was left uncultivated and to expand the area of cultivated land, the Party vigorously led peasants to organize cooperative mutual assistance. Lenin said: "Scattered and isolated small producers, namely peasants, are economically and politically united either by the bourgeoisie (which has always been the case in capitalist systems, in all countries, and in all revolutions of the new era, and will always be the case as long as capitalism exists) or by the proletariat (which has existed in rudimentary form during the briefest periods of the greatest revolutionary upsurges in the new era; and in a more developed form in Russia from 1917 to 1921). Only self-important arrogant people can talk and dream about a 'third' path, a 'third' force." ("Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction", Jiefang Publishing House edition, Volume I, page 380)

In the movement to organize cooperative mutual assistance, the Party has continuously carried out serious ideological education work. It is necessary to overcome both coercion and commandism and to correct laissez-faire. Especially after land reform, a kind of agricultural socialist ideology was prevalent in the countryside. People who held this ideology attempted to understand and transform the world with the standards of the small-scale peasant economy, believing that transforming the entire social economy into a uniform "average" small-scale peasant economy would be to implement socialism and avoid the development of capitalism. For example, the "big mess hall" eating system proposed in some areas was a reflection of this erroneous thinking. The Party vigorously criticized and corrected this erroneous thinking. With the development of the rural economy, the emergence of some new-style rich peasants is inevitable and not terrible. However, in the movement to organize cooperative mutual assistance, there was a phenomenon of attacking and repelling individual farmers (in the Northeast region, individual farmers need two or three horses to operate independently, which means they have the conditions of a prosperous middle peasant or rich peasant). The Party promptly criticized and corrected this deviation, and clearly pointed out that middle peasants must never be treated with a coercive and rude attitude, and the emerging rich peasants are allowed to exist and develop. In leading peasants to implement the cooperative mutual assistance movement, the Party insisted on implementing the basic principle of "voluntariness and mutual benefit" proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong.

In leading peasants to implement the cooperative mutual assistance movement, the Party and the People's Government not only carried out tremendous ideological education work, but also adopted practical and effective economic support policies. The state provides agricultural loans of hundreds of thousands of tons of grain every year to help peasants solve the problems of seeds, fertilizers, farm tools, pesticides, and draft animals. All these economic assistance measures focus on organized peasants. The Party deeply understands Lenin's statement: "The emergence of every social system requires considerable financial assistance from the corresponding class. Needless to say, the emergence of 'free' capitalism has cost many billions of rubles. The social system that we should especially help at present is the cooperative system, and we should now recognize and specifically implement this." ("Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction", Jiefang Publishing House edition, Volume I, page 496) There is no doubt that in addition to vigorously helping cooperatives with their turnover, it is completely correct to provide financial assistance to rural labor mutual assistance organizations as a new social system.

In recent years, cooperative mutual assistance in Northeast China's rural areas has made great progress. According to statistics in 1950, more than 4 million households in rural areas have been organized, accounting for approximately 70% to 80% of the total number of rural households. It can be seen that the scattered small producers – peasants – are united not by other classes and parties, but by the working class and its vanguard – the Communist Party – in economic and political terms.

Facts have proved that when the broad masses of peasants are organized, improve their technology, they greatly improve agricultural productive forces. In recent years, Northeast China has restored hundreds of thousands of hectares of wasteland and newly reclaimed virgin land. Without the extensive cooperation and mutual assistance of peasants, this would be fundamentally impossible. Because in Northeast China, cultivating land generally requires two or three horses and a plow, especially in the reclamation of land in northern Manchuria, it requires at least five or six horses and a plow, which is beyond the reach of ordinary individual small farmers. In the rural cooperative mutual assistance movement, various places have transformed a large number of idlers and loafers who did not engage in production in the past and landlord and rich peasant elements, and extensively mobilized rural women who lacked farming habits to participate in agricultural production, which has played a huge role in improving agricultural productive forces. Moreover, this situation has created a possibility for surplus labor in some areas to begin to transfer to urban industrial production. For example, in the past two years, tens of thousands of surplus rural laborers in the southern Manchuria region alone have transferred to urban industrial production.

Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Peasants – these are the predecessors of Chinese workers, and tens of millions of peasants will enter cities and factories in the future. If China needs to build a strong national industry and build many modern cities, there will be a long process of transforming the rural population into the urban population." ("On Coalition Government", Jiefang Publishing House edition, page 79) Obviously, we now have the beginning of this "long process."

Facts have proved that organizing not only solves the difficulties of scattered farm tools and draft animals that are not conducive to farming after land reform, but also guarantees that peasants improve labor efficiency, grow more grain and increase income, thereby creating conditions for expanded reproduction. For example, the Wang Zhentang mutual assistance group in Heilongjiang Province was originally a poor village of thirty-two households. After land reform, it organized labor mutual assistance, combined agriculture and sideline occupations, reclaimed wasteland to increase production, and began to use new-style farm tools in 1951, which further promoted the improvement of productive forces. The economic situation of the group has developed greatly in recent years: in terms of cultivated land area, it was 64.5 hectares in 1947, 96 hectares in 1948, 110 hectares in 1949, 212 hectares in 1950, and 272 hectares in 1951. The number of horses increased from seventeen in 1947 to seventy-six in 1951; the number of cattle increased from six in 1947 to twenty-seven in 1951; the amount of grain increased from 180 shi in 1947 to 1,359 shi in 1950. The economic situation of all peasant households in the village has generally improved, and no household has declined.

This situation is as Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "Cooperative organizations such as labor exchange teams originally existed among peasants, but at that time, they were only a manifestation of the peasants' miserable lives. Now, the labor exchange teams in the liberated areas of China have undergone changes in form and content. They are a manifestation of the peasants' desire to develop their productive forces and strive for a prosperous life."
("On Coalition Government", Jiefang Publishing House edition, page 81)

(2) Improving Technology and Transforming Nature

In order to improve agricultural productive forces, it is necessary to improve technology, and it is necessary to improve the existing backward and even primitive technical conditions. In recent years, Northeast China has carried out a series of work in this regard. As everyone knows, the fourteen years of rule by Japanese imperialism caused great damage to the livestock industry in Northeast China. At the end of the puppet Manchukuo period, the number and quality of draft animals were greatly reduced. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, it was immediately damaged by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, resulting in serious epidemic diseases and deaths of draft animals. In 1948 alone, 40,000 draft animals died in the former Nenjiang Province. This damage to agricultural productive forces was alarming. The Party and the People's Government believed that it was necessary to gradually curb the epidemic spread and large-scale death of draft animals. Therefore, they began to manufacture various anti-epidemic serums in large quantities in cities, and then dispatched a large number of technical cadres to go deep into the countryside to carry out large-scale anti-epidemic work. In terms of rinderpest prevention, 553,567 heads were injected in 1949 and 1,047,695 heads were injected in 1950. In terms of anthrax prevention, 2,230,890 heads were injected in 1949 and 4,402,177 heads were injected in 1950. At present, the epidemic spread of various draft animal diseases has basically been curbed. On this basis, we can further greatly develop the livestock industry, thereby greatly improving agricultural productive forces.

In order to prevent and control crop diseases and insect pests, urban pesticide factories are gradually increasing their supply of various agents and equipment to the countryside. In terms of preventing and controlling cotton diseases and insect pests, because cities can guarantee the supply of sufficient agents and equipment, the sown area of cotton has been promoted to double year by year. With the development of industry, cities have begun to supply the countryside with tens of thousands of tons of chemical fertilizers and tens of thousands of new-style farm tools every year.

As everyone knows, after land reform, the broad masses of peasants were liberated from the shackles of feudal relations of production, and their enthusiasm for production was greatly improved. However, they are still using primitive and clumsy farm tools for production. Primitive farm tools determine primitive farming methods, and primitive farming methods cannot increase yields. The Party and the People's Government have fully paid attention to this major issue. Therefore, in 1950, it was decided to reform farm tools. We are now carrying out the arduous task of fundamentally reforming farm tools and thus reforming farming methods. Only in this way can agricultural productive forces be continuously improved, and conditions for agricultural modernization – mechanization – can be gradually created from farming methods. In 1952, the state will invest tens of thousands of tons of grain to build a huge new-type farm tool manufacturing factory, which will make it possible to supply the countryside with tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of new-style farm tools every year.

The Party and the People's Government paid great attention to improving crop varieties. Agricultural experiment stations and demonstration farms in various places have widely carried out variety test research and promotion and propagation work. At present, for several major crops such as soybeans, rice, wheat, and cotton, we are likely to strive to completely eliminate hybrid and inferior varieties within three to five years and promote and propagate improved varieties that have undergone scientific experimental research. This will be of great significance for improving grain yield and quality.

In recent years, in terms of flood control and water management, the state has invested hundreds of thousands of tons of grain and carried out many water conservancy construction projects. In 1950 alone, 503 kilometers of new embankments, 126 kilometers of drainage channels, 802 kilometers of repaired embankments, and 33 drainage gates were built. The four famous irrigation areas in Northeast China have basically been restored. The Party and the People's Government fully recognized that relying solely on building embankments and blocking mouths cannot eradicate floods. Therefore, in 1950, it was decided to adopt a principle of focusing on fundamental solutions, that is, focusing on actively developing water resources, and carrying out modern water conservancy construction that combines water management with power generation, irrigation, shipping, and industrial water use. At present, the Liaoning River fundamental solution project survey and other preparatory work have begun. After the completion of this project, the people on both sides of the Liaoning River will be fundamentally free from floods.

In order to fundamentally transform natural conditions and eliminate wind, sand, and floods, in 1950, the Party decided to build protective forest belts in western Manchuria, and formulated a preliminary draft plan, which is scheduled to be carried out from 1951 to 1962 (which can also be shortened). In the western part of the Northeast region, on 6.3 million hectares of land, a main protective forest belt 30 to 50 meters wide is built every ten kilometers; windbreak forest networks are built in cultivated land and arable uncultivated land; riverbank forests are built on both sides of major rivers; sand-fixing forests are built in sand dune areas; and water source conservation forests are built in mountainous areas and upstream rivers; the above-mentioned pure afforestation area reaches 1 million hectares. The completion of this protective forest belt can increase the yield per hectare of 1.9 million hectares of cultivated land by more than 400 jin, and can expand the new cultivated land by 2.5 million hectares, which can increase grain production by about 2.48 million tons; the annual direct income of 1 million hectares of forests is worth about 947,000 tons of grain. In addition, the resources of forest by-products created by afforestation and the sideline income increased to the masses are even impossible to estimate. Large-scale afforestation to transform the harsh nature and make it benefit the people, like the fundamental solution project of water conservancy, is a revolutionary cause that takes into account the long-term interests of the people. Obviously, it is unnecessary to prove that carrying out this kind of cause is only possible in a country where the most scientifically visionary working class and its party have seized power. In all capitalist countries, even raising similar issues is impossible. The proposal of our Western Manchuria protective forest belt construction plan is due to the great inspiration of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union.

The road of modern agricultural production and construction in the Soviet Union is the road we aspire to. When the conditions for the development of our industry cannot supply the countryside with tractors, we began to establish mechanized farms in 1948. At present, there are more than 40 mechanized farms in Northeast China, with a cultivated area of 150,000 to 160,000 hectares, accounting for approximately 1% of the agricultural economy in Northeast China, which has constituted a new component of the agricultural economy in Northeast China. The farms have modern mechanical traction of more than 30,000 horsepower and more than 2,000 agricultural machines of various types. At present, mechanized farms in Northeast China are only a beginning, and are only "a spark of fire," but with the development of national industrial construction, it will be a new cause with the most promising development prospects.

Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "Without the socialization of agriculture, there will be no complete and consolidated socialism. To socialize agriculture, it is necessary to develop a strong industry with state-owned enterprises as the main body. The people's democratic dictatorship state must solve the problem of national industrialization step by step." ("On People's Democratic Dictatorship", People's Publishing House edition, page 15)

This points out the road for the entire economic construction and also points out the basic direction for the development of agricultural productive forces.

Lenin taught us: "...The cause of transforming small peasants, the cause of transforming their entire psychology and habits, is a cause of several generations. Only the material basis, only technology, only the large-scale use of tractors and machines in agriculture, only the large-scale implementation of electrification can solve this problem of the relationship with small peasants and can make their entire psychology tend to be sound." ("Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction", Jiefang Publishing House edition, Volume I, page 321)

It can be seen that in order to transform small peasants, it is necessary to develop modern industry, thereby creating conditions for improving agricultural technology. This is a long-term and arduous construction process.

(3) Promoting Mutual Assistance Between Urban and Rural Areas and Consolidating the Worker-Peasant Alliance

In order to develop agricultural productive forces, we must correctly solve the problem of the exchange of industrial and agricultural products. Because: Commerce can promote agricultural development or destroy agriculture. The Party and the People's Government have planned to develop state-owned commerce, private commerce, and cooperative commerce networks, and under the leadership of state-owned commerce, industry and agricultural production have been closely linked with commerce as the link. People cannot forget that during the most tense years of the War of Liberation, the Northeast region was divided and blockaded. At that time, there was a shortage of urban industrial products, commerce could not be carried out normally, peasants could not sell all their surplus grain, and could not buy enough cloth. They had to burn soybeans and soybean cakes as fuel. Only after the liberation of the entire Northeast region, the cities and large industries were in the hands of the working class, and we further developed commerce, it was possible to purchase large quantities of surplus grain and other sideline products from peasants, and supply peasants with increasing amounts of living and production materials. For example, in 1950, the state purchased 63.5% more surplus grain from peasants than in 1949, and purchased 331% more rural local products than in 1949. In terms of supply, state-owned stores supplied the people with necessities in 1950, exceeding 126% of 1949, of which 39.6% were sold through cooperatives. As everyone knows, cooperatives mainly serve the rural areas in their business operations. The Trade Department of the Northeast People's Government estimated that the purchasing power of urban and rural areas in 1951 would increase by 29.1% compared with 1950, but by the second quarter, the sales volume had completed 60% of the annual plan. From January to May 1951, state-owned trade supplied urban and rural commodities twice as much as in the same period in 1950, and five times as much as in the same period in 1949. The total supply and sales volume of cooperatives from January to June 1951 increased by 46.5% compared with the same period in 1950.

This situation fully illustrates Comrade Mao Zedong's correct instruction: "Peasants – this is the market for Chinese industry. Only they can supply the richest grain, raw materials, and absorb the largest industrial products." ("On Coalition Government", Jiefang Publishing House edition, page 79)

As is well known, due to the semi-colonial and semi-feudal social characteristics, the relationship between the few large and medium-sized cities and the countryside in old China, in addition to the general characteristics of cities in capitalist countries, that is, the oppression and exploitation of the countryside by cities, also has the feudal and comprador characteristics corresponding to Chinese society. On the one hand, it is the mutual combination of the landlord class and bureaucratic capital, usurious commercial capital to jointly exploit the countryside; on the other hand, it is the political and economic manipulation and monopoly of imperialism. Therefore, the result of the existence or development of cities in old China not only cannot improve agricultural productive forces and promote rural prosperity, but also deepens rural decline and bankruptcy. The new Chinese city under the leadership of the working class and its party is completely the opposite: we not only generally use commerce as a link to promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, but more importantly, we are increasingly narrowing the price scissors difference between industrial and agricultural products. That is to say, the Party and the People's Government in Northeast China often pay close attention to grasping the correct price policy. For example, in the winter of 1948, one ton of grain could only be exchanged for one bolt and four zhang of cloth, and at the end of 1949, it could be exchanged for 2.8 bolts of cloth (northern Manchuria, central Manchuria). With the development of industry, this situation will gradually improve. As Stalin taught us: "The peasant is neither an object of exploitation nor a colony for the working class. The peasant economy is the market for industry; similarly, industry is the market for the peasant economy. But the peasant is not only a market for us. He is also an ally of the working class, and for this very reason, improving the peasant economy, large-scale cooperation of peasants, and improving their material conditions are a prerequisite without which we cannot guarantee the slightly significant development of our industry. Conversely, the development of industry, the production of agricultural machinery and tractors, and the large-scale supply of industrial products to peasants are also a prerequisite without which we cannot advance agriculture. This is one of the important foundations of the alliance between the working class and the peasants."
("Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction", Jiefang Publishing House edition, Volume II, pages 74-75)

In terms of commodity exchange, we have begun to sign various ordering and pre-purchase contracts with peasants through state-owned stores, cooperatives, and the People's Bank, using the contract system to ensure appropriate prices for agricultural products, such as the ratio of cotton to grain, the ratio of hemp to grain, etc. In this way, peasants can carry out planned production according to the needs of national industry and trade, and there is no ideological concern that overproduction will lead to price declines. At the same time, the contract system also stipulates the peasants' obligations to the country. They must ensure the quantity and quality of industrial raw materials and commercial grain, and deliver them to the state on time. In this way, we have the possibility of incorporating scattered small-scale peasant production into the track of the entire national planned economy.

In terms of agricultural taxation, we have clearly stipulated that after land grading, for land of the same grade, those who increase yield due to diligent and careful farming, or those who reduce yield due to laziness and abandonment, the collection of public grain shall not be increased or decreased accordingly. In terms of the general burden of public grain, 23% of the output was collected in 1948, only 20% was collected in 1949, and it was roughly 20% in 1950. That is to say, there is a fair and reasonable agricultural tax policy that encourages the development of agricultural production.

Stalin taught us: "In the economic field, in the socialist construction field, and also in the political field (for example, overthrowing the bourgeois regime in October 1917 and establishing the proletarian dictatorship), the proletariat can and should be the basic leader of the peasant masses. Only on the basis of the gradual improvement of the material life of the majority of the peasant masses (poor peasants, middle peasants) can national industrialization be truly implemented. These peasant masses are the main market for our industry. Therefore, we must implement an economic policy (price policy, tax policy, etc.) that is sufficient to consolidate the alliance between industry and the peasant economy, and sufficient to maintain the alliance between the working class and the main peasant masses." ("Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction", Jiefang Publishing House edition, Volume II, page 82)

We have implemented this and will continue to implement it. Therefore, the working class will always maintain the broad masses of peasants, the most reliable ally, whether in economic construction, in consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, or in defending the country's military struggle.

III. Conclusion

What does the development of agricultural productive forces in Northeast China in recent years illustrate?

It illustrates: Only when the working class and its party lead the broad masses of peasants to implement land reform and completely break the shackles of feudal relations of production can the road for the development of agricultural productive forces be opened up.

It illustrates: After land reform, only when the working class and its party lead peasants to gradually move from cooperative mutual assistance to collectivization is it the only correct road for the continuous development of agricultural productive forces.

It illustrates: Only the development of urban industry can create the conditions for improving agricultural technology, and only national industrialization can promote agricultural modernization.

It illustrates: "Only on the basis of the gradual improvement of the material life of the majority of the peasant masses (poor peasants, middle peasants) can national industrialization be truly implemented. These peasant masses are the main market for our industry." ("Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction", Jiefang Publishing House edition, Volume II, page 82)

It illustrates: Only by conscientiously implementing the Party's various correct economic policies, especially the price policy and tax policy, can we truly promote mutual assistance between urban and rural areas and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.

It illustrates: The rapid development of agriculture and industry has laid a material foundation for improving the living standards of the broad masses of people, improving cultural education, and consolidating the people's democratic regime.

Finally, it illustrates: We are overcoming all difficulties, defeating various enemies at home and abroad, and advancing victoriously along the road of "liberating peasants, developing modern industry, and establishing an independent, free, democratic, united and prosperous New China" under the wise leadership of the CPC Central Committee, Comrade Mao Zedong, and the Central People's Government!

    本报特约记者　张庆泰
    毛泽东同志在“论联合政府”中写道：
    “中国一切政党的政策及其实践在中国人民中所表现的作用的好、坏、大、小，归根到底，看其对于中国人民的生产力的发展是否有帮助及其帮助之大小。它是束缚生产力的？还是解放生产力的？彻底消灭日本侵略者，实行土地改革，解放农民，发展现代工业，建立独立、自由、民主、统一与富强的新中国，只有这一切，才能使中国社会生产力获得解放，才是中国人民所欢迎的。”
    根据毛泽东同志这一深刻提示，研究共产党的政策对于发展东北农业生产力的作用是很有意义和很有益处的。

    还在解放战争最紧张的年代，共产党即以大力帮助东北广大农民实行了土地改革。当农村封建生产关系被彻底打破之后，广大农民的生产积极性立即发挥出来。特别在一九四九年东北全境解放以后，共产党集中力量领导经济建设，农业生产力更获得了迅速的恢复与发展。如东北耕地面积在一九四三年为一、七八六万垧，一九四六年缩减为一、三一四万垧，一九五○年基本上全部恢复了。耕畜在一九四三年为四二七万头，一九四八年减为三七六万头，目前则已大大地超过了一九四三年的耕畜数量。一九四九年东北粮食总产量为一、三二○万吨，一九五○年增至一、八○八万吨，即增加百分之三十七，达战前一九四三年最高水平百分之九十九点四八。每垧地单位面积产量在一九四六年为一、六一五斤，一九五○年增至二、四一二斤，超过了战前一九四三年最高水平百分之十三点九三。有些县份粮食产量且已超过战前的最高水平，如吉林舒兰县在一九四三年全县总产量为一三九、五六六吨，一九五○年则增至一六六、七五八吨，超过了一九四三年百分之十九点四八。
    随着工商业的发展，工业原料作物播种面积逐年增加，仅棉花一项，一九五○年即较一九四九年扩大百分之九十七点三，一九五一年又较一九五○年扩大百分之九十一点九，商品粮食作物播种面积亦逐年增加，仅大豆一项，一九五○年即较一九四九年扩大百分之二十八点一七，一九五一年又较一九五○年扩大百分之六点四七。广大农村的副业生产也在发展着，如黑龙江省一九五○年推销土产、副产品约折粮九十二万吨，一九五一年土产、副产商品化部分约可折粮一一○万吨。
    由于农村经济的发展，农民的购买力也逐年提高，因而扩大了工业品市场。东北全区国家商业销布的数字，一九四九年为四○○万匹，一九五○年为九○二万匹；一九五○年较一九四七年增加十一倍强。一九五○年农民的购买力约较一九四九年提高百分之三十三，如单从纱布来说，一九四九年平均每十个人买一匹布，一九五○年平均每四个半人即买一匹布。一九五一年第一季度，在业务经营上主要是面向农村的合作社的零售总值，较一九五○年同一时期增加了百分之三十八点一。应该指出，在农村社会零售商品流转总额中，合作社零售额所占比重仅为百分之四十强。农民购买力的提高，突出地表现在购买生产资料的比重逐年增加了。据黑龙江省克山县民主村调查，一九四九年生产资料仅占全购买力的百分之十点七，一九五○年春生产资料已增至百分之二十三；松江省呼兰县腰堡村一九四九年生产资料占全购买力百分之十九，一九五○年增至百分之三十五点五。农民生产资料需要的比重逐年增加，正说明了农民要求扩大再生产的趋势。
    目前东北农村经济发展的基本特点是：中农已成为农村中的大多数，北部老区中农约占农户的百分之六十至七十，南部新区约占百分之五十以上。其中并出现了少数新式富农。多数贫雇农上升为中农，少部分农民虽不及中农的生活，但亦有某些上升。下降的仅是因为缺乏劳动力，或因疾病灾害，或因缺乏生产资料与畜力，或者好吃懒做，而不能维持再生产的少数农户。总之，目前东北农村经济发展的基本趋势，是绝大多数农民日益走向富裕。
    二、党对农村的领导及其政策
    东北农业生产力之所以获得如此迅速的恢复与发展，绝不能设想仅是由于实行土地改革的结果。如所周知，土地改革后的农民经济，基本是分散的个体的小农经济，正如斯大林所说的，“它是站在资本主义与社会主义间的十字路口的经济。它既可以发展到资本主义方面去，如现在资本主义国家里的情形那样，也可以发展到社会主义方面去，如在我们国家里，在无产阶级专政条件下所要发生的情形一样。”（“列宁、斯大林论社会主义经济建设”、解放社版、下册、三八页）而小农经济的资本主义发展道路，就是经过农民的最深刻的分化，在一个极端上是巨大的大地产，而在另一个极端上则是广泛的贫困化。显然用不着证明，东北农村经济绝不是沿着资本主义道路发展的，而且也不可能沿着这条道路发展。如果一般地说，农村经济依赖着城市，依赖着工业，依赖着信贷制度，依赖着国家政权的性质，因而决定农村必不可免地跟着城市走，那么，在我们这里，城市完全是另一种面貌。因为在我们这里，城市工业主要是掌握在工人阶级手中，信贷制度和国家政权是在工人阶级及其政党的领导之下。而工人阶级及其政党的基本政策是促进城乡互助，巩固工农联盟。这就决定了我们农村经济只能沿着新民主主义的道路前进。共产党怎样不断帮助广大农民发展生产力呢？
        （1）组织起来，由穷变富
    在土地改革与解放战争时期，生产工具是分散的；由于战争动员频繁，农村劳动力相对减少了；当时耕地的荒废是很严重的。为了保证不荒地并进而扩大耕地面积，党便大力领导农民组织合作互助。列宁说过：“零星散漫的小生产者，即农民，在经济上和政治上，或者是由资产阶级来联合他们
    （这在资本主义制度下，在一切国家，在新时代一切革命中，从来往往就是如此，只要是在资本主义制度下，还永远会是如此），或者是由无产阶级来联合他们（这在新时代某些最伟大革命高潮中最短促期间的萌芽形式上曾经有过；在一九一七至一九二一年俄国之比较发达的形式上也有过）。只有妄自尊大的倨傲之辇，才能空谈与梦想什么‘第三条’道路，什么‘第三种’势力。”（“列宁、斯大林论社会主义经济建设”、解放社版、上册、三八○页）
    在组织合作互助运动中，党曾不断地进行了严重的思想教育工作。既要克服强迫命令，又要纠正放任自流。特别是在土地改革之后，农村曾经流行这
    一种农业社会主义的思想，抱有这种思想的人们，企图用小农经济的标准，来认识和改造世界，以为把整个社会经济都改造为划一的“平均的”小农经济，就是实行社会主义，而可以避免资本主义的发展。如某些地区所提出的“大伙房”吃饭，就是这种错误思想的反映。党曾以大力批判并纠正了这种错误思想。随着农村经济的发展，某些新式富农的出现是不可避免的，而且也不是可怕的；然而在组织合作互助运动中，却产生了打击与排斥单干的现象（在东北地区个体农民单独经营，需有两三匹马，即具备着富裕中农或富农的条件）。党及时地批判并纠正了这种偏向，并明确地指出，绝不能以强迫命令的粗暴态度对待中农，对新起的富农是允许其存在和发展的。党在领导农民实行合作互助运动中，坚持贯彻了毛泽东同志所提出的“自愿两利”的基本原则。
    党和人民政府，在领导农民实行合作互助运动中，不仅进行了巨大的思想教育工作，而且采取了实际有效的经济扶植政策。国家每年都要以数十万吨粮食的农业贷款，帮助农民解决种子、肥料、农具、农药及耕畜问题。所有这些经济上的帮助，都是以组织起来的农民为重点。党深刻理解列宁的说法：“每个社会制度之产生，都需要有相当阶级的财政帮助。不待说，‘自由’资本主义之产生，是花费过许多万万卢布的代价的。现时我们所应当特别帮助的社会制度，就是合作社制度，对于这一点，我们现在应当认识和具体实行。”（“列宁、斯大林论社会主义经济建设”、解放社版、上册、四九六页）毫无疑问，我们除了应当大力帮助合作社周转之外，把农村的劳动互助组织当做一种新的社会制度给以财政帮助，是完全正确的。
    几年来，东北农村合作互助有了很大的发展，根据一九五○年的统计，农村组织起来的户数在四百万户以上，约占农村总户数的百分之七十至八十。由此可见，在经济上与政治上，把散漫的小生产者——农民联合起来的，不是别的阶级和政党，而正是工人阶级及其先锋队——共产党。
    事实证明，广大农民组织起来，改进技术，大大地提高了农业生产力。几年来，东北恢复撩荒和新开生荒数百万垧，如果没有农民的广泛合作互助，这是根本不可能的。因为在东北耕地，一般需要两三匹马一副犁，特别是在北满开荒，至少需要五、六匹马一副犁，这是一般个体小农所办不到的。在农村合作互助运动中，各地大批改造了过去不事生产的懒汉二流子和地主富农分子，广泛地发动了缺乏农耕习惯的农村妇女参加了农业生产，这对提高农业生产力，都起了巨大作用。而且这一情况还造成一种可能，使某些地区的剩余劳动力开始转到城市工业生产中去。如两年来仅南满地区，即有数万个农村剩余劳动力转入了城市工业生产中去。
    毛泽东同志说过：“农民——这是中国工人的前身，将来还要有几千万农民进入城市，进入工厂。如果中国需要建设强大的民族工业，建设很多的近代式的大城市，就要有一个变农村人口为城市人口的长过程。”（“论联合政府”、解放社版、七十九页）显然，我们现在已经有了这种“长过程”的开端。
    事实证明，组织起来，不仅解决了土地改革后农具耕畜分散不利于农耕的困难，而且保证了农民提高劳动效率，多打粮食增加收入，从而创造了扩大再生产的条件。譬如黑龙江省王振堂互助组，原来是个三十二户的穷屯子，在土地改革之后，即组织劳动互助，农副业结合，开荒增产，一九五一年开始使用了新式农具，更加促进了生产力的提高。该组几年来经济情况有了很大的发展：从耕地面积来说，一九四七年为六四·五垧，一九四八年为九六垧，一九四九年为一一○垧，一九五○年为二一二垧，一九五一年为二七二垧。马由一九四七年的十七匹，增至一九五一年的七十六匹；牛由一九四七年的六头，增至一九五一年的二十七头；粮食由一九四七年的一八○石，增至一九五○年的一、三五九石。全屯农户经济普遍上升，没有一户下降的。
    这种情况，正如毛泽东同志所指出的：“变工队一类的合作组织，原来在农民中就有了的，但在那时，不过是农民悲惨生活的表现。现在中国解放区的变工队，形式与内容都起了变化，它是农民群众为着发展自己的生产力，争取富裕生活的表现。”
    （“论联合政府”、解放社版、八十一页）
            （2）改进技术，改造大自然
    为了提高农业生产力，就必须改进技术，就必须改进现有落后的甚至是原始的技术条件。几年来，东北在这方面进行了一系列的工作。大家知道，日本帝国主义十四年的统治，给东北畜牧事业以很大的摧残，耕畜在伪满末期，不论数量质量都大为降低。抗战胜利后，紧接着又遭到蒋匪帮的破坏，造成了严重的耕畜疫病与死亡。一九四八年，仅原嫩江省一个地区即死亡耕畜四万匹。这对农业生产力的破坏是惊人的。党和人民政府认为必须逐步遏止耕畜的疫病流行和大批死亡，因此开始在城市大量制造各种防疫血清，然后派遣大批技术干部深入农村，展开了巨大规模的防疫工作。在牛瘟预防方面，一九四九年注射了五五三、五六七头，一九五○年注射了一、○四七、六九五头。在预防炭疽方面，一九四九年注射了二、二三○、八九○头，一九五○年注射了四、四○二、一七七头。目前各种耕畜疫病的流行基本已被遏止，在这个基础之上，我们就有可能进一步大量发展畜牧事业，从而把农业生产力大大地提高一步。
    为了防治农作物病虫害，城市的农药厂正在逐年增多地供应农村以各种药剂和器械。在防治棉花病虫害方面，因为城市能够保证供应充分的药剂和器械，才促进了棉花播种面积逐年加倍的扩大。随着工业的发展，城市已开始每年供应农村以数万吨的化学肥料和数万台的新式农具。
    大家知道，土地改革之后，广大农民从封建的生产关系束缚下解放出来，生产积极性是大为提高了，但仍然使用着原始的粗笨农具进行生产，原始的农具决定了原始的耕作法，而原始的耕作法是不能提高产量的。党和人民政府充分注意了这一重大问题，因此一九五○年即决定了改革农具。现在我们正在进行从根本上改革农具从而改革耕作法的艰巨工作，因为只有这样，才能把农业生产力不断提高，才能逐渐为农业现代化——机械化从耕作法上创造条件。一九五二年国家将投资数万吨粮食，兴建一个巨大的新型农具制造工厂，这就有可能每年供给农村由数万台增至数十万台的新式农具。
    党和人民政府对改善作物品种，给以极大的注意，各地农事试验场，示范农场，广泛地开展了品种试验研究和推广繁殖工作。目前对于大豆、水稻、小麦、棉花几种主要作物，我们已有可能争取在三、五年内完全淘汰杂种劣种，而推广繁殖经过科学试验研究的优良品种。这对提高粮食产量和质量，将是有巨大意义的。
    几年来，在防洪治水方面，国家投资数十万吨粮食，进行了许多水利建设事业，仅一九五○年新筑堤五○三公里、排水渠道一二六公里，补修堤岸八○二公里、排水闸三十三座。东北著名的四大灌溉区，基本上已经恢复。党和人民政府充分认识了仅靠筑堤堵口，不能根绝水患。因此在一九五○年决定了以治本为主的方针，即着重于积极地开发水利资源，进行治水与发电、灌溉、航运及工业用水相结合的现代化水利建设。目前业已开始辽河治本工程调查勘测及其他准备工作。这个工程完成之后，辽河两岸的人民即可根本免除水患。
    为了根本改造自然条件，杜绝风沙水患，一九五○年，党决定了在西满营造防护林带，并制定了初步计划草案，预定自一九五一年至一九六二年的十二年间（还可缩短），在东北区西部六百三十万垧土地上，每隔十公里营造一条宽三十至五十公尺的基干防护林带；在已耕地和可耕未垦地中，营造防风林网；在主要河川两岸，营造护岸林；在沙丘地带，营造固沙林；在山区与河流上游，营造水源涵养林；上述纯造林面积达一百万垧。这个防护林带的完成，可使一百九十万垧已耕地，每垧提高产量四百斤以上，并可扩大新耕地二百五十万垧，约可增产粮食二百四十八万吨；一百万垧林木的每年直接收益，约值九十四万七千吨粮食。此外，由于造林而创造的森林副产物的资源，给群众增加的副业收益，更是无法估计的。大规模营造森林，用以改造恶劣的大自然，使之造福人民，就像水利治本工程一样，是一个为人民长远利益做打算的革命事业。显然用不着证明，进行这种事业，只有在最有科学远见的工人阶级及其政党掌握了政权的国家中，才有可能。在一切资本主义的国家里，连提出类似的问题都是不可能的。我们这一西满防护林带营造计划的提出，是由于得到了苏联先进经验的伟大启示。
    苏联现代化农业生产建设的道路，是我们所向往的道路。当我国工业发展条件还不能供应农村以拖拉机的时候，我们从一九四八年就开始建立了机械化农场。目前东北机械化农场已有四十余处，耕地面积达十五、六万垧，其比重约占东北农业经济百分之一，已构成东北农业经济新的组成部分。各场拥有现代化的机械牵引力达三万余马力，各种农业机器达两千余台。目前东北机械化农场虽然还只是一个开端，还只是“星星之火”，但随着国家工业建设的发展，它将是最有广阔发展前途的新事业。
    毛泽东同志教导我们说：“没有农业社会化，就没有全部的巩固的社会主义。而欲农业社会化，必须发展以国有企业为主体的强大的工业。人民民主专政的国家，必须有步骤地解决这个国家工业化的问题。”（“论人民民主专政”、人民出版社版、十五页）
    这里给我们指出了整个经济建设的道路，也给我们指出了农业生产力发展的基本方向。
    列宁教导我们说：“……改造小农的事业，改造他们整个心理与习惯的事业，乃是好几代的事业。只有物质的基础，只有技术，只有在农业中大规模地运用拖拉机与机器，只有大规模地实行电气化，才能够解决这个对小农关系的问题，才能够使他们的全部心理趋于健全。”（“列宁、斯大林论社会主义经济建设”、解放社版、上册、三二一页）
    由此可见，为要改造小农，就必须发展现代工业，从而创造改进农业技术的条件。这是一个长期的艰巨的建设过程。
        （3）促进城乡互助巩固工农联盟
    为了发展农业生产力，我们就必须正确地解决工农产品交换问题。因为：商业可以促进农业的发展，也可以破坏农业。党和人民政府有计划地发展了国营商业、私人商业和合作社商业网，而在国营商业领导之下，以商业为纽带，把工业生产和农业生产紧密地连结起来了。人们不能忘记，在解放战争最紧张的年代，东北地区处在被分割被封锁的情况下，当时城市工业品缺乏，商业不能正常进行，农民卖不了全部余粮，买不到足够布匹，曾不得不把大豆和豆饼当燃料烧。只有在东北全境解放之后，城市和大工业掌握在工人阶级的手中，我们进一步发展了商业，这才有可能大量收购农民的余粮及其他副业产品，并供应农民以日益增多的生活资料和生产资料。譬如一九五○年国家收购农民余粮比一九四九年增加百分之六十三点五，收购农村土产比一九四九年增加百分之三百三十一。而在供应方面，一九五○年国家商店供给人民必需品，超过一九四九年的百分之一百二十六，其中经过合作社推销者，占百分之三十九点六。大家知道，合作社在业务经营上，主要是面向农村的。东北人民政府贸易部估计一九五一年城乡购买力较一九五○年提高百分之二十九点一，但到第二季度，销货额即已完成全年计划的百分之六十。一九五一年一月至五月间，国营贸易供给城乡商品较一九五○年同一时期扩大了一倍，为一九四九年同一时期的五倍。合作社一九五一年一月至六月供销总额较一九五○年同一时期增加百分之四十六点五。
    这种情况完全可以说明毛泽东同志的正确提示：“农民——这是中国工业的市场，只有他们能够供给最丰富的粮食、原料与吸收最广大的工业品。”（“论联合政府”、解放社版、七九页）
    如所周知，由于半殖民地半封建的社会特点，旧中国的少数大、中城市和农村的关系，除了带有资本主义国家城市的一般特点，即城市压迫与剥削农村外，同时还具有和中国社会相应的封建性和买办性的特点，即一方面是地主阶级与官僚资本、高利贷商业资本的互相结合，共同榨取农村；另一方面是帝国主义在政治上经济上的操纵和垄断。因此，旧中国城市存在或发展的结果，不仅不能提高农业生产力，促进农村的繁荣，而且加深了农村的衰落和破产。在工人阶级及其政党领导下的新的中国城市，完全与此相反：我们不仅一般地以商业做纽带，促进城乡的物资交流，而且更重要的是我们日益缩小工农产品在价格上的剪刀差额。这就是说，东北的党和人民政府经常密切注意掌握正确的价格政策。譬如粮布交换比值，一九四八年冬季，一吨粮食只换一匹又四丈布，一九四九年末，即可换到二点八匹布（北满、中满），随着工业的发展，这
    一情况将日益好转。正如斯大林教导我们的：“农民对工人阶级既不是剥削的对象，也不是殖民地。农民经济是工业的市场；同样，工业是农民经济的市场。但是农民对我们不仅是市场而已。他还是工人阶级的同盟军，正因为如此，提高农民经济，农民的大量的合作化，其物质状况之改善，乃是一种前提，没有这种前提，就不能保证我们工业之稍微重大的发展。反转来说，工业的发展，农业机器及拖拉机的生产，工业生产品给农民的大量供给，也是一种前提，没有这个前提，就不能向前推进农业。这是工人阶级与农民联盟的重要基础之一。”
    （“列宁、斯大林论社会主义经济建设”、解放社版、下册、第七四—七五页）
    我们在商品交换方面，已经开始通过国营商店、合作社与人民银行，和农民订立各种定货及预购合同，用合同制保证农产品的适当价格，如棉粮比价麻粮比价等。如此，农民即可根据国家工业和贸易的需要，实行有计划的生产，而无因生产过多招致产品跌价的思想顾虑。同时，经过合同制也规定了农民对国家的义务，他们要保证工业原料和商品粮食的数量与质量，并按期交给国家。如此，我们就有了可能，把分散的小农生产纳入整个国家计划经济的轨道上来。
    我们在农业税收方面，明确地规定了，在土地评级之后，凡同一等级的土地，其因勤劳细作而提高产量，或因懒惰荒废而降低产量者，征收公粮一律不得随之提高或降低。在一般的公粮负担方面，一九四八年征收产量百分之二十三，一九四九年仅征收百分之二十，一九五○年大体仍为百分之二十。这就是说，有了一个公平合理的鼓励农业生产发展的正确的农业税收政策。
    斯大林教导我们说：“在经济方面，在社会主义建设方面，同样在政治方面（譬如一九一七年十月推翻资产阶级政权，建立无产阶级专政一样），无产阶级都能够而且应当是农民群众基本的领导者。只有根据大多数农民群众（贫农、中农）物质生活之逐渐改善，才能真正实行国家工业化，这些农民群众是我们工业的主要市场。因此必须执行一种足以巩固工业与农民经济之间的联合，足以保持工人阶级与主要的农民群众之间联盟的经济政策（价格政策，赋税政策等）。”（“列宁、斯大林论社会主义经济建设”、解放社版、下册、八二页）
    我们正是这样执行了并将继续贯彻下去，因此，工人阶级无论在经济建设方面，在巩固人民民主专政方面，在保卫祖国的军事斗争方面，都会永远保持广大农民群众这个最可靠的同盟军。
    三、结束语
    几年来东北农业生产力的发展说明了什么呢？
    它说明了：只有工人阶级及其政党领导广大农民实行了土地改革，彻底打破了封建生产关系的枷锁，才给农业生产力的发展开辟了道路。
    它说明了：在土地改革后，只有工人阶级及其政党领导农民逐步地由合作互助走向集体化的道路，才是农业生产力不断向前发展的唯一正确道路。
    它说明了：只有城市工业的发展，才有可能创造改进农业技术的条件，只有国家工业化，才有可能促进农业现代化。
    它说明了：“只有根据大多数农民群众（贫农、中农）物质生活之逐渐改善，才能真正实行国家工业化，这些农民群众是我们工业的主要市场。”（“列宁、斯大林论社会主义经济建设”、解放社版、下册、八二页）
    它说明了：只有认真贯彻执行党的各种正确的经济政策，特别是价格政策和赋税政策，才能真正促进城乡互助，巩固工农联盟。
    它说明了：农业和工业的迅速发展，就给广大人民生活的改善，文化教育的提高，以及人民民主政权的巩固，奠定了物质基础。
    最后，它说明了：我们正在中共中央、毛泽东同志、中央人民政府的英明领导下，克服一切困难，战胜国内外各种敌人，沿着“解放农民，发展现代工业，建立独立、自由、民主、统一与富强的新中国”的道路胜利地前进！（附图片）
