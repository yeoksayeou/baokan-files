    Pingyuan Province Democratic Women's Federation
    Cooperates with Health Department to carry out Maternal and Child Health Work
    In Pingyuan Province, under the close cooperation of women's federations at all levels and health departments, considerable achievements have been made in maternal and child health work for more than two years.
    In terms of reforming old midwives, a total of 18,114 old midwives have been trained. Due to the adoption of the new midwifery method, the infant mortality rate has been greatly reduced. In the past, the infant mortality rate was about 40 percent, but during 1950 and 1951, the infant mortality rate was reduced to 12 percent.
    Reforming old midwives is a complex organizational task. Before starting to train old midwives, the women's federations at all levels looked for suitable candidates and conducted propaganda and mobilization among them. During the training period, village activists, women's representatives, and cadres of county and district women's federations participated in political and ideological leadership, conducting political education to raise their political awareness, so that most of them became active promoters of women's work. After the training, they were organized to form midwifery groups (midwifery stations). At the same time, a regular reporting system was established; birth registration forms were issued; and certain work tasks were assigned to them (implementing the new midwifery method, conducting propaganda among women, and taking apprentices). Usually, the women's federations at all levels cooperated with the health departments to strengthen their leadership, supervision, and inspection, and held regular forums by area or district to exchange work experience and help them summarize their work, thus continuously improving their political awareness and technical level. Because they established the viewpoint of serving the people, the midwives were able to conduct prenatal examinations and postpartum visits, telling the mothers how to prepare for labor and what to pay attention to after childbirth; they also used the method of taking apprentices to reform old midwives (or new midwives) who had not received training, so that everyone realized ideologically that "midwifery" is not a "shameful" thing. They became powerful health propagandists and epidemic reporters in the countryside. When epidemics occurred, they personally ran to the county, district, and village health committees to report the epidemic and help patients find doctors; in addition, some midwives also conducted Marriage Law propaganda among the masses and understood the implementation of the Patriotic Convention. They also became propagandists for rural childcare organizations and disseminators of hygienic childcare knowledge.
    In terms of women's daily hygiene, women are often educated to pay attention to menstrual hygiene and treatment; to wash their hair, feet, and body frequently; and to wash not only themselves, but also their children. Therefore, some women bought large basins so that both adults and children could take baths. In June of this year, the masses in Liulin Village, Lin County, also automatically built a bathhouse. Because of attention to menstrual hygiene, many women who were previously infertile became pregnant.
    In terms of epidemic prevention injections and vaccinations, women's federations and women's representative conferences at all levels have also vigorously carried out publicity work, changing the incorrect understanding of the peasant masses that "epidemics are heavenly plagues, which are bound to occur every year, and those who are destined to die cannot escape, and those who are lucky will not die," "injections are useless, they create illness when there is no illness," and "vaccinations should only be done when peach blossoms bloom." In order to meet the needs of the masses and solve the difficulty of the lack of technical personnel, the women's federations cooperated with the health departments to train technical personnel and mobilized female primary school teachers and district and village women cadres to learn injection and vaccination techniques. At the same time, they united the traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in rural areas to serve the peasants.

    平原省民主妇女联合会
    配合卫生部门开展妇幼卫生工作
    平原省的妇幼卫生工作，在全省各级民主妇女联合会与卫生部门密切配合下，两年多来取得了不少的成绩。
    在改造旧接产员方面，共训练旧接产员一万八千一百十四名。由于采用了新接生法，婴儿的死亡率已大为减少，过去婴儿的死亡率约为百分之四十左右，一九五○年与一九五一年期间婴儿的死亡率减低到百分之十二。
    改造旧接产员是一件复杂的组织工作。在开始训练旧接产员以前，曾通过各级民主妇女联合会物色对象，并向她们进行宣传动员。在学习期间，村积极分子、妇女代表会和县、区民主妇女联合会的干部都参加政治思想领导，向她们进行政治教育，提高她们的政治觉悟，使她们大部分成为妇女工作的积极推动者。在训练以后，把她们组织起来，成立接生小组（接生站）。同时，订出了定期的汇报制度；发给出生登记表格；给她们规定一定的工作任务（实行新接产法、向妇女群众进行宣传、带徒弟）。平时，各级民主妇女联合会配合卫生部门加强对她们的领导、督促和检查，按片或按区经常召开座谈会，交流工作经验，并帮助她们总结工作，这样就不断地提高了她们的政治觉悟和技术水平。由于树立了为人民服务的观点，接产人员都能够作到产前检查和产后访视，告诉产妇怎样进行临产时的准备工作，产后应该注意什么；又用带徒弟的方法，改造未受过训练的旧接产人员（或新的接产人员），使大家从思想上认识了“接产”并不是“丢人”的事。她们在农村中成了有力的卫生宣传员、疫情报告员。在流行病发生时，她们亲自跑到县、区、村卫生委员会，报告疫情，并帮助病人请医生；此外，有的接产员还向群众进行婚姻法宣传，了解爱国公约的执行情况等。她们还成为农村托儿组织的宣传者，卫生育婴常识的传布者。
    在妇女日常卫生方面，经常教育妇女：要注意经期卫生和治疗；平时勤洗头发、勤洗脚、勤洗身体；不但自己洗，而且经常给孩子洗。因此有的妇女买了大盆，大人孩子都洗澡。今年六月，林县柳林村群众还自动修一个澡塘子。由于注意了经期卫生，许多过去不生育的妇女都怀孕了。
    在防疫注射和种痘方面，各级民主妇女联合会、妇女代表会也曾大力进行了宣传工作，改变了农民群众“流行病是天疫，年年必然要流行，在数者难逃，命大的不死”“打针不顶事，没病找病害”“桃花开，方种痘”等不正确认识。为了满足群众的要求，并解决技术人员缺乏的困难，民主妇女联合会配合卫生部门训练了技术人员，并发动小学校女教员及区村妇女干部学习注射和种痘等技术。同时团结农村中的中医，为农民服务。
