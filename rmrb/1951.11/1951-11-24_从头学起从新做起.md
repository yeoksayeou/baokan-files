　　Strive to transform your thinking and become a people's teacher in the new China!
　　Starting from Scratch, Starting Anew
　　Dai Fanglan, Chairman of the Chinese Society of Plant Pathology, Professor of Beijing Agricultural University, and Director of the Institute of Plant Pathology

　　Before liberation, for many years, due to dissatisfaction with the reactionary rule at the time, a problem that often lingered in my mind remained unresolved: how to improve our motherland, which was suffering from internal and external troubles? To take the path of capitalism? During my studies abroad, I witnessed the disparity between the rich and the poor in capitalist countries, and the parliament was controlled by the wealthy, which I considered unreasonable. However, at that time, I couldn't propose a solution, but I felt that this path was unsuitable for China. Then, should we take the path of communism? At that time, I only had a vague concept of communism, and I was influenced by reactionary propaganda, and I doubted whether this was the correct path. It was not until after liberation that I studied "The History of Social Development," "On New Democracy," and "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," especially in which it was mentioned that since the failure of the Opium War in 1840, patriotic people in our country had implemented many methods in searching for the correct path to revitalize the country, but none of them had been effective. The "October Revolution" in Russia during the First World War "sent us Marxism-Leninism with a bang of guns. The October Revolution helped the advanced elements of the whole world and also helped China to use the proletarian worldview as a tool to observe the fate of the country and reconsider their own problems. Take the Russian road—this is the conclusion." I suddenly realized, and the problem that had not been solved for many years was answered. The joy in my heart at that time was beyond words, and I naturally "leaned to one side." After liberation, although I was hit by the deviation of individual party members, I still dared to offer them opinions. I have always been a taciturn person, and if I hadn't "leaned to one side," I wouldn't have done this.

　　At the time of liberation, I thought that my teaching and work in the past had been quite responsible, and that I had steadfastly stuck to my post, so I thought I was innocent. After studying, I began to doubt everything in the past, and after preliminary analysis, I became more clear about my past mistakes. First, let's talk about teaching: at that time, I came up with a set of predetermined standards, and students who did not meet these standards were given failing grades. For students with poor grades, I did not tutor them to learn well, nor did I let them criticize my teaching methods and content.

　　Let's talk about the courses taught and the teaching content. Although the materials were locally sourced, the formulation of the courses and teaching content did not take into account the needs of the time and was divorced from reality. Such teaching is simply misleading students! This aimless and impractical style was undoubtedly learned from capitalist countries.

　　Research work should also be reviewed. I once presided over plant pathology research. At that time, I subjectively wanted to serve the people. Before conducting research, we first went to various places to investigate and collect data. After consideration, we focused on defining research projects, formulating research plans, and proceeding step by step. However, at that time, we had a mentality of belittling the working people, and there seemed to be a gulf between us and the villagers. We only subjectively went to the countryside to investigate, without approaching them, understanding their difficulties, or consulting them and learning from their valuable experience. Therefore, when carrying out our work, we failed to elevate their valuable experience to theory. Later, when subjectively deciding on research projects, what was decided may not have been the problem that urgently needed to be solved at the time. These serious mistakes were all caused by our usual mentality of belittling the working people. A more serious problem was that our work was divorced from reality. The results obtained did not actually serve the people, and it was impossible to serve the people at that time. It only served as a tool to embellish the reactionary ruling class. We originally wanted to serve the people subjectively, but because we did not know the truth of class stand at that time, we served the reactionary ruling class.

　　At that time, when defining research projects, we had foreseen that under the objective conditions at that time, practical work was unlikely to play a role. Therefore, we left a part of the projects to carry out basic work—fungus investigation and classification. Subjectively, I felt that this basic knowledge would still be useful after the political situation was on the right track. I personally took on this work. In fact, the main motivation at that time was still because I was dissatisfied with the ruling class at the time but did not have the courage to revolutionize. Doing this work was just to escape reality, and it was still starting from the individual, which was a supra-class idea. Although the work done at that time was related to plant pathology and other economic construction, it did not solve practical problems and made no contribution to the villagers.

　　At that time, agricultural research work in China, in addition to the errors pointed out above, generally had many other shortcomings: First, people engaged in research work lacked an overall concept, only cared about doing their own work, and did not link the work to the relevant aspects, so that the results could not be applied. For example, crop breeding work only focused on cultivating varieties with excellent quality, without considering their disease resistance or other aspects. The bred varieties were often unacceptable to the villagers. Second, everyone only did their own thing, and there was very little collective cooperation. "Colleagues are enemies." Not only did they not cooperate with each other, but they also envied each other. Some people wanted to write more articles as a tool for personal "climbing up." Third, research institutions also did not cooperate with each other, so it was inevitable that there would be duplicate work with other institutions, wasting manpower and material resources. There were also cliques that tried to consolidate and expand their own positions and influence, and people without cliques simply had no opportunity to work. Fourth, as far as I know, no one had ever collected the good experiences of the villagers and tried to elevate them to theory. Fifth, some people did not consider the requirements of the villagers and conducted research without goals. Research like this, even if the objective conditions were good, could not make any contribution to the people.

　　Regarding my personal aspect, there is a most serious point to be raised: that is, in the past, I was not only dissatisfied with the reactionary rule, but also did not automatically conduct in-depth research on communism. As a scientific worker, this is an unacceptable attitude. This attitude undoubtedly stems from the supra-class idea of emphasizing technology and belittling politics.

　　Obviously, these supra-class ideas, purely technical viewpoints, individual liberalism, compromise, and conservatism are all due to the ideological consciousness of my past class at work, which of course is inseparable from my personal family background—the declining bureaucratic landlord class. The mentality of belittling the working people still exists seriously among our agricultural workers today. This explains why some people still do not believe that labor model Qu Yaoli produced more than 900 kilograms of cotton per mu.

　　A few days ago, I heard the recording of Mr. Liang Shuming's speech at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, in which there was a sentence: "I am very ashamed, I have made no contribution to the people!" This is also a sentence that I have hidden in my heart and have not said.

　　After such a preliminary liquidation of myself, I initially felt extremely painful, because most of my life was wasted, and my past efforts were also wasted. But after the liquidation, it was like taking a bath, removing many obstacles, and feeling very happy spiritually. Someone said: "You have negated everything in your past, have you lost your personal self-confidence? Can you still work in the future?" As far as I am concerned, after the liquidation, I have not only not lost my self-confidence, but have strengthened it. Because I am sure that I can serve the people, and I have this determination. However, I took the wrong path in the past, which led to a wasted life. Now I have found the correct path and recognized many of my personal problems. It is just right to prescribe the right medicine, correct past mistakes, seize the time and use my remaining years to maximize my ability to serve the people, in order to make up for the wasted half of my life under the current unprecedentedly good objective conditions.

　　People like me who are older and have been deeply poisoned by the old society need to study even more. These toxins cannot be eliminated in a short time and must be continuously studied and self-reviewed in order to gradually change them.

　　Now, institutions of higher learning in Beijing and Tianjin have launched ideological remoulding studies. Everyone should take advantage of this opportunity to thoroughly remould themselves. After liberation, we also carried out studies and have gained considerable achievements. However, progress is very slow, and it cannot keep up with the objective development, so that our strength cannot make a positive contribution in construction work. At present, there are still quite a few people in schools with a strong sense of individual liberalism, individual departments cannot unite internally, and individual departments still have serious departmentalism. Under this situation, we are still far from establishing the concept of serving the people wholeheartedly, cooperation between departments and institutions, etc. The reform of higher education will be hindered. The current objective conditions require us to transform ourselves quickly. This kind of transformation is not enough to rely solely on theoretical study in the past, and progress will be very slow. Only by using the theories learned to examine ourselves, and then having others dig out the problems that we cannot see ourselves, and kindly help us transform, can we consolidate our gains and continuously improve. Only in this way can we clear the toxins in our minds, and everyone can exert our strength, and the reform of higher education can proceed smoothly.

　　This self-criticism is still too crude and not deep enough. There are still many shortcomings that have not been reviewed. I hope that my past and present colleagues, new and old classmates, and friends will not hesitate to give me opinions and help my transformation. Let us all achieve a brilliant victory on the ideological front.

　　努力改造思想，做一个新中国的人民教师！        
    从头学起从新做起
    中国植物病理学会理事长  北京农业大学教授  兼植物病理研究所所长  戴芳澜
    在解放以前，多少年来因对当时的反动统治不满，常常盘旋于我脑中的有一个未能解决的问题：如何能把我们这个饱受内忧外患的祖国弄好？走资本主义的道路吧，我在国外留学期间，亲眼看见资本主义国家内贫富悬殊，议会为有钱的人所把持，认为不合理。不过那时也提不出来究竟应该怎么办，总觉得这条路在中国是不合适的。那末，走共产主义的道路吧，我那时对于共产主义只有一个模糊概念，并且受过反动宣传的影响，很怀疑这是一条正确的道路。一直到解放以后，学习了《社会发展史》，《新民主主义论》，和《论人民民主专政》，尤其内中讲到我国爱国的人士，自从一八四○年鸦片战争失败那时起，在寻找复兴国家的正确的道路中实行了许多办法，都没有收到效果。第一次世界大战俄国“十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。十月革命帮助了全世界的也帮助了中国的先进分子，用无产阶级的宇宙观作为观察国家命运的工具，重新考虑自己的问题。走俄国人的路——这就是结论。”我不觉大彻大悟，多少年未能解决的问题得到解答。那时心情的愉快，非言语可以形容，就很自然的“一边倒”了。解放后虽因个别党员的偏差，使我受到打击，但我仍敢于对他们提供意见。我素来是一个沉默寡言的人，如果不是“一边倒”的话，就不会这样做了。
    解放时，我满以为从前教学做事都是相当负责的，并且百折不回的坚守岗位，想来是可告无罪的了。等到进行了学习以后，对以前种种开始怀疑起来，再经过初步分析，更明确了个人过去的错误。首先讲教学吧：那时我拿出预定的一套标准，不够这标准的学生就给他们以不及格的处分。对于成绩坏的学生，并没有辅导他们学习，使他们学好。也没有让他们批评我的教学法和教学内容。
    再讲教的课程和教学内容吧，虽说就地取材，但是，课程和教学内容的编定并未考虑到当时的需要，与实际是脱节的。这样的教学，简直是误人子弟！这种无目标、不切实际的作风，无疑是从资本主义国家学来的。
    研究工作也是一样应当检讨。我曾一度主持植物病理研究事业。那时主观上是想为人民服务的。进行研究之前，我们先到各地调查，搜集资料。经过考虑后，重点的规定研究项目，制订研究计划，按步进行。不过那时我们有轻视劳动人民的心理，与老乡们间好象有一条鸿沟。我们只主观的下乡调查，并未去接近他们，去了解他们的困难，也未去向他们请教，学习他们的宝贵经验。因此在进行工作时，没能把他们的宝贵经验提高到理论。后来主观的决定研究项目时，所决定的可能并不是当时迫切待解决的问题。这种严重的错误，都是由于我们平时轻视劳动人民的心理所造成的。更严重的问题，是我们的工作与实际脱了节。所得的结果，实际上未曾为人民服务，在那时也不可能为人民服务。只作了反动统治阶级的粉饰工具。我们主观上原想为人民服务的，因为那时不知阶级立场这一真理，却为反动统治阶级服了务。
    在那时规定研究项目时，我们已预见到在当时的客观条件下，实际工作很可能不会起作用。因此留下一部分的项目来进行基本上的工作——真菌调查与分类。主观上觉得这些基本知识在政治上正轨以后还是有用的。我个人就担任了这种工作。其实当时主要的动机，还是因为不满当时的统治阶级而又无革命的勇气，做这工作只是为了逃避现实，仍是从个人出发的，是超阶级思想。那时所作的工作虽与植物病理和其他经济建设有关，然而并未解决实际上的问题，对老乡们是毫无贡献的。
    那时国内的农业研究工作，除了上面所指出的错误外，一般还有其他许多缺点：第一，从事研究工作的人，缺乏整体观念，只管做自己份内的工作，而不把工作联系到有关的多方面，以致得出来的结果无法应用。例如作物育种工作只顾培育出品质优良的品种，而不考虑到它的抗病性或其他各方面。所育成的品种，时常是老乡们所不能接受的。第二，各人只做各人的，很少是集体合作的。“同行是冤家”，彼此间不但不合作，而且互相嫉视。有的人想多写几篇文章作为个人“往上爬”的工具。第三，研究机关也是一样各不相谋，因此难免与其他机关有重复的工作，浪费了人力与物力。还有的闹宗派来巩固和扩张自己的地位和势力，无宗派的人简直没有工作的机会。第四，据我知道的，以前从没有人搜集过老乡的良好经验，试把它提高到理论。第五，还有的不考虑老乡们的要求，无目标的进行研究。象这样的做研究，就是客观条件良好的话，也不能够对人民有什么贡献。
    关于我个人方面还有最严重的一点须要提出的：就是从前既不满反动统治，对于共产主义又不自动的去深入研究，作为一个科学工作者，这是一种要不得的态度。这种态度，无疑仍是从重技术轻政治的超阶级思想中，产生出来的。
    很明显的，这些超阶级思想，纯技术观点，个人自由主义，妥协性，保守性都是由于我过去阶级的思想意识在作祟，这当然与我个人家庭出身——没落官僚地主阶级——是分不开的。轻视劳动人民的心理，到今天在我们农业工作者中间，还是严重的存在着。这说明了为什么有些人对劳动模范曲耀离每亩出产九百多斤棉花还不相信。
    前几天听到梁漱溟先生在人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议致辞的录音，其中有一句话：“我很惭愧，我对人民没有什么贡献！”这也就是我藏在胸中而未说出来的一句话。
    在这样初步清算了自己以后，起初感到异常痛苦，因为生命的一大半算白过了，过去的努力也白费了。但是在经过清算以后，好象洗了一个澡，去掉很多障碍，精神上倒很痛快。有人说：“你否定了你过去的一切，是否丧失了个人自信心？以后还能工作吗？”在我来讲，经过清算后我不但没有丧失反而增强了自信心。因为我肯定我是能为人民服务的，而且有这个决心。不过以往走错了路，以致虚度半生，现在找到了正确的道路和认识了个人的许多毛病，正好对症下药，修正过去的错误，在目前空前良好客观条件下，抓紧时间用我余年尽量发挥能力来为人民服务，以弥补过去半生的虚度。
    象我这样年岁较大的人，中旧社会的毒较深，更需要学习，这些毒素不是一时可以清除的，还须继续不断的学习和自我检讨，才能逐渐的改过来。
    现在北京天津的高等学校展开了思想改造的学习，大家正好利用这个机会来彻底改造自己。解放后我们也曾进行了学习，已有相当的收获。不过进步很慢，与客观的发展不能配合，使我们这份力量不能在建设工作中，有积极的贡献。目前在学校中有浓厚个人自由主义的人尚不在少数，个别的系内部尚不能团结，个别的系还有严重的本位主义。照这种的情况，距离建立全心全意为人民服务的观点，系间和机关的合作等还很远。高等教育的改革，会受到阻碍。现在客观条件要求我们，赶紧地改造自己。这种改造象过去专凭理论学习是不够的，进步会很慢的，只有把学习所得的理论来检查自己，再由旁人来发掘我们自己所看不见的毛病，善意地来帮助我们改造，然后才能巩固我们既得的收获，并不断的改进。只有这样清除了我们思想上的毒素，大家才能发挥出我们的力量，高等教育的改革，也就能顺利的进行。
    这篇自我检讨，尚嫌粗枝大叶，不够深刻。个人还有很多缺点尚未加检讨，希望过去和现在的同事们，新旧的同学们，朋友们不客气的对我提出意见，帮助我的改造。让我们大家在思想战线上取得一个辉煌的胜利。
