(Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 2nd) According to TASS, Vienna, 2nd: The Second Session of the World Peace Council opened on November 1st in Vienna, the capital of Austria.

At 5 p.m. that day, the brightly lit hall was filled with delegates, guests and reporters from various countries. The members of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council – outstanding fighters for world peace and human happiness – appeared on the podium. Frédéric Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council, took the chair.

First, Pastor Kock, Chairman of the Austrian Peace Council, delivered a congratulatory speech.

Kock expressed his warm gratitude to the World Peace Council for choosing Vienna as the venue for the meeting, and on behalf of the Austrian people, congratulated the most outstanding representatives of the greatest movement in human history.

Kock emphasized that although the Austrian government did not give the conference the reception it deserved, the Austrian people sincerely congratulated the peace representatives, because they also advocated maintaining peace between countries. Kock continued that the Austrian people do not place their hopes on atomic bombs, but
on the forces of peace.

After Kock's speech, Joliot-Curie took to the podium. He warmly congratulated the members of the World Peace Council gathered in Vienna, especially the representatives of the great China, the heroic Korean people, Iran, Egypt, and other peoples who are fighting tenaciously for peace. On behalf of the World Peace Council, Joliot-Curie thanked the Austrian friends for their warm hospitality and their assistance in the conference arrangements.

Joliot-Curie said: The World Peace Council was established less than a year ago at the Warsaw Peace Congress. In this short period, the movement of peace fighters has made significant achievements. Now, we must discuss the experiences we have accumulated in the struggle to maintain peace. We must tell all good people the significance of our movement.

He continued that the peace movement has become so strong that even the forces of war have had to give way. This movement is a manifestation of the noble will and hope of all progressive humanity.

Joliot-Curie emphasized: We must follow the following three most important principles:

(1) Peaceful coexistence between different systems is entirely possible.

(2) All differences can and must be resolved by peaceful means.

(3) One country should not interfere in the internal affairs of another country.

All our decisions must be based on these principles. The majority of mankind supports these principles. Therefore, the enemies of peace cannot do anything to us. We must expose the warmongers and their tactics of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. Interference in the internal affairs of other countries is especially characteristic of the policy of the United States. The United States uses so-called "aid" as an excuse to interfere in the internal affairs of various countries. But the people of Iran and Egypt have found ways to prevent this interference.

Joliot-Curie continued: People do not need war, therefore, they are paying more and more attention to the movement to maintain peace. We must expand our movement so that the warmongers have to maintain peace against their wishes. As you all know, the movement to demand the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact has achieved great success. This proves on what basis peace can be saved.

We must fight against the absurd propaganda that "war is inevitable." Peace can be maintained. One of the ways to maintain peace is to reduce armaments and stop the arms expansion movement. The arms expansion movement only benefits a handful of arms dealers. The heavy burden of war preparation expenses on the people must be lifted.

Millions of people have expressed their support for the prohibition of atomic weapons. Other types of weapons of mass destruction must also be prohibited.

We call on all peoples of the world to strengthen the struggle to defend peace, and our voice must be heard by everyone. We have established contact with the International Committee of the Red Cross and many international or national organizations, which is very important for the struggle for peace. The United Nations General Assembly will soon hold its Sixth Session in Paris, and we must make our voice heard by the Assembly.

Our meeting must come up with concrete proposals to strengthen the fight against the warmongers. We must use simple and clear examples to explain to the general public what peace can give them and what the cost of war is. A very simple calculation shows that the money spent on war in one month is enough to irrigate the Sahara Desert or educate one hundred million people.

Joliot-Curie concluded: The greatest happiness – living in peace – should be given to the people of all countries. We will do our utmost to ensure the victory of the struggle to defend peace.

Fennert, Secretary of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council, announced the Executive Bureau's recommendations on the agenda of the meeting. He proposed the following agenda: (1) "Possibilities and Ways to Conclude a Peace Pact," Rapporteur: Nanni, Vice-Chairman of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council.

(2) "Developing Cultural Relations Between Countries," Rapporteur: Mrs. Fiaher.

The World Peace Council unanimously adopted the agenda and working procedures of the meeting.

The meeting also adopted the Executive Bureau's recommendation to establish two committees, one on political issues and one on cultural issues.

In the evening, the Austrian Peace Council hosted the members of the World Peace Council.

    世界和平理事会会议开幕
    居里号召全世界人民加强保卫和平斗争
    主张裁减军备禁止原子武器以维护和平
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社维也纳二日电：世界和平理事会第二次会议已于十一月一日在奥地利首都维也纳开幕。
    当天下午五时，灯光灿烂的大厅内聚满了各国代表、宾客和记者，世界和平理事会执行局的委员们——争取世界和平与人类幸福的杰出战士——在主席台上出现。世界和平理事会执行局主席约里奥—居里就主席位。
    首先，由奥地利和平理事会主席考克牧师致贺词。
    考克对于世界和平理事会选择维也纳为会议地点，表示热烈的感谢，并代表奥地利人民向人类历史上最伟大的运动的最优秀的代表们表示祝贺。
    考克强调说，虽然奥地利政府没有给大会以应有的招待，但奥地利人民衷心地向和平代表们致贺，因为他们也主张各国间维持和平。考克继续说，奥地利人民并不把希望寄托在原子弹上，而是
    寄托在和平力量上。
    考克发言之后，约里奥—居里即登上讲台。他热烈地向在维也纳聚会的世界和平理事会的委员们致贺，特别是向伟大的中国、英雄的朝鲜人民、伊朗、埃及以及其他为争取和平而顽强奋斗的人民的代表们致贺。约里奥—居里代表世界和平理事会，感谢奥地利朋友的热诚招待和他们在大会布置工作方面的协助。
    约里奥—居里说：世界和平理事会是不到一年以前在华沙和平大会上成立的。在这短短的期间，和平战士的运动取得了重大的成就。现在，我们必须讨论我们在保持和平的斗争中所累积的经验。我们必须把我们这个运动的意义告诉全体善良的人民。
    他继续说，和平运动已变得非常强大，甚至战争力量也不得不退让了。这个运动是全体进步人类的崇高意愿和希望的表现。
    约里奥—居里强调说：我们必须遵循下列三个最重要的原则：
    （一）不同的制度和平共存是完全可能的。
    （二）一切分歧都能够而且必须用和平方法求得解决。
    （三）一个国家不应干涉另一个国家的内政。
    我们的一切决定都必须以这些原则为基础。人类的大多数都支持这些原则。因此，和平的敌人丝毫奈何不了我们。我们必须揭露战争贩子及他们干涉别国内政的策略。干涉别国内政尤其是美国的政策的特点。美国以所谓“援助”为藉口来干涉各国的内政。可是伊朗与埃及的人民已找到了防止这种干涉的方法。
    约里奥—居里继续说：人民不需要战争，因此，他们越来越重视维护和平的运动。我们必须扩大我们的运动，使战争贩子不得不违背他们的愿望来维持和平。各位都知道，要求缔结五大国和平公约的运动已取得巨大成就。这一点证明了在什么基础上才能挽救和平。
    我们必须与“战争不可避免”这种荒谬宣传作斗争。和平是能够保持的。维持和平的方法之一就是裁减军备并停止扩张军备运动。扩张军备运动只使得一小撮军火商得到利润。人民身上战争准备费的沉重负担必须取消。
    千百万人民都已表示主张禁止原子武器。其他种类具有大批杀伤的武器也同样必须禁止。
    我们号召全世界各族人民加强保卫和平的斗争，我们的声音一定要让每一个人都听到。我们已经和红十字会国际委员会和许多国际团体或一国性的团体建立了联系，这对争取和平的斗争是非常重要的。联合国大会不久就要在巴黎举行第六届大会，我们一定要让大会听到我们的声音。
    我们这次会议一定要拟出加强反对战争贩子的斗争的具体建议。要以简单明了的事例向一般人民说明和平能给予他们什么，战争的代价是什么。很简单的计算就表明：在一个月里花在战争上的钱，就够来灌溉萨哈拉大沙漠或使一亿人受教育。
    约里奥—居里最后说：应该把最大的幸福——在和平里生活——给予各国人民。我们将尽我们的全部力量，来使保卫和平的斗争获得胜利。
    世界和平理事会执行局秘书芬诺尔塔宣布了执行局关于会议议程的建议。他提出下述议程：（一）“缔结和平公约的可能性和办法”，报告人世界和平理事会执行局副主席南尼。
    （二）“发展各国之间的文化关系”，报告人费雅贺夫人。
    世界和平理事会一致通过了会议的议程和工作程序。
    会议还通过了执行局的关于成立两个委员会的建议，一个是关于政治问题的，一个是关于文化问题的。
    晚上，奥地利和平理事会招待世界和平理事会理事们。
