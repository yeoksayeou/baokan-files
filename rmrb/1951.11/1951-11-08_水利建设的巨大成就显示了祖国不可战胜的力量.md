    The Great Achievements in Water Conservancy Construction Demonstrate the Invincible Strength of the Motherland
    Editor: After reading Minister Fu Zuoyi of the Ministry of Water Conservancy of the Central People's Government's speech at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, published in the People's Daily on October 30th, we deeply felt the great significance of the motherland's water conservancy construction achievements over the past two years. As the speech stated, "In the past two years, the total number of civilian workers mobilized to participate in water conservancy projects nationwide has reached 10,037,000, with an additional 320,000 People's Liberation Army soldiers assisting in the work, totaling over 500 million workdays. A total of 11,283 large and small buildings were constructed. The total amount of earthwork done was 959.9 million cubic meters, which, if built into a dike one meter high and one meter wide, could encircle the Earth's equator 24 times." This demonstrates the invincible strength of our people's democratic country. This is unprecedented in Chinese history, something unimaginable before liberation.
    A classmate once passed through the "Yellow Flood Area" of eastern Henan in 1940. He described the situation at the time as: "The Yellow River water receded half a year ago, but the silt remained on the vast plains for hundreds of miles, turning fertile land into a desert. The originally majestic temples were buried halfway in the mud and sand, and the weeds grew more than one person tall." What about now? On the vast plains of eastern Henan, farmers can already obtain good harvests.
    From this, we see the beautiful future of the motherland, and we must fight to the end to thoroughly realize this vision.

    水利建设的巨大成就显示了祖国不可战胜的力量
    编辑同志：我们读了人民日报十月三十日刊载的中央人民政府水利部傅作义部长在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议上的发言后，深深感到两年来祖国水利建设成就的巨大意义。如发言中说，“两年来全国动员参加水利工程的民工，先后共达一千零三十七万人，还有人民解放军三十二万人协助工作，共做工五亿余工日。所做大小建筑物总共一万一千二百八十三座。所做土工总量，总共九亿五千九百万立方公尺，若筑成高宽各一公尺的长堤，可以围绕地球赤道二十四周”。这显示了我们人民民主国家的不可战胜的力量。这是中国历史上从来没有过的事，这在解放前是想像不到的。
    一位同学曾在一九四○年经过豫东的“黄泛区”，他描述当时的情况说：“黄河水退了半年了，但淤沙留在数百里长的广大平原上，良田成了沙漠，原来巍峨的庙宇被泥沙埋了半截，荒草长到一人多高”。现在呢？广大的豫东平原上，农民已经可以获得很好收成。
    从这里，我们看到了祖国美丽的远景，我们一定要为彻底实现这个远景而奋斗到底。
