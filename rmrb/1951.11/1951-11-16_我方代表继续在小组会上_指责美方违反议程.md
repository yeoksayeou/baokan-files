Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 15th — At the sub-committee meeting of the Korean armistice negotiations on the 15th, our representative continued to accuse the other side's November 11th proposal of directly violating the provisions of the second agenda item, with the sole purpose of delaying the armistice negotiations. Our representative questioned: If the other side has no intention of resolving the second agenda item, which is a fundamental condition for the armistice, how can it be expected to have the sincerity to resolve other agenda items? Our representative pointed out: The three proposals put forward by our side on November 10 are an inseparable whole. Any distortion by the other side cannot conceal its fairness and rationality. The sub-committee meeting should immediately adopt our three proposals so that the delegation meeting can enter the discussion of the third agenda item and quickly reach an armistice agreement.

　　我方代表继续在小组会上
    指责美方违反议程
    【新华社开城十五日电】在十五日的朝鲜停战谈判的小组委员会上，我方代表继续指责对方十一月十一日方案直接违反第二项议程的规定，其目的仅在拖延停战谈判。我方代表诘问说：如果对方无意解决作为停战基本条件的第二项议程，更如何能够期望其有诚意解决其他各项议程？我方代表指出：我方十一月十日提出的三项建议，是互相关联不可分割的整体。对方的任何曲解，都不能掩盖它的公平合理性。小组会议应立即通过我方三项建议，以便代表团大会得以进入第三项议程的讨论，迅速达成停战协议。
