Xinhua News Agency, November 26th: The All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, the All-China Students' Federation, the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization, and the All-China Federation of Scientific and Technological Societies today issued a joint declaration protesting the U.S. government's illegal detention of returning Chinese students. The full text is as follows:

"On September 25th, when our students Liu Anhua and eight others were returning to China from the United States and passing through Honolulu, they were suddenly illegally detained by the U.S. intelligence agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This is another barbaric act by the U.S. government, following the detention of Professor Zhao Zhongyao and others in Japan last September. We lodge a solemn protest against this robber-like behavior of the U.S. government and demand the immediate release of all arrested students. This despicable act by U.S. imperialism will inevitably be condemned and spurned by the people of the world."

    抗议美政府扣押我留学生
    【新华社二十六日讯】中华全国民主青年联合会总会、中华全国学生联合会、中华全国科学技术普及协会和中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会四个人民团体，今天发表抗议美国政府非法扣押我归国留学生的联合宣言，全文如下： “九月二十五日，我留美学生刘安华等九人由旧金山返国途经檀香山时，突遭美国特务机关联邦调查局的非法扣押，这是美国政府继去年九月在日本扣押赵忠尧教授等之后，又一次扣押我国科学工作者的蛮横行为。我们对美国政府的这种强盗行为，提出严正的抗议，要求立即释放各被捕同学。“美帝国主义的这种卑鄙的行为，将不可避免地遭到全世界人民的谴责和唾弃。”
