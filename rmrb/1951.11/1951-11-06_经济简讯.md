    ▲ The Huangyang Canal irrigation project in Wuwei County, Gansu Province, was completed and put into operation on October 20th. The Huangyang Canal draws water from the Huangyang River to irrigate farmland on both banks; the east and west main canals are more than 23 kilometers long, irrigating more than 155,000 mu of farmland. With this irrigation, the annual grain yield can be increased by 8 million jin.
    ▲ The modern Huangyang Sluice irrigation project in the Hetao area of ​​Suiyuan Province was completed at the end of September this year, and water can be released in May next year to irrigate 2.8 million mu of farmland. The completion of the Huangyang Sluice will not only prevent the flooding of canal water, but also free up 100,000 mu of arable land along the Ul Liang Hai.
    ▲ This year, a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army opened up 20,000 mu of new cotton-growing areas in the grassland north of Sulai and Shawan in the lower reaches of the Manas River in northern Xinjiang, and has achieved a bumper harvest. The cotton fiber produced is 25 mm long and can be spun into 42-count yarn. The growing period is only about 120 days, and the average yield per mu is 40 to 50 jin of ginned cotton, with a maximum of 105 jin. Now is the cotton harvesting season, and the PLA soldiers are happily harvesting the fruits of their labor and are selecting seeds to expand the planting area and increase production next year.

    ▲甘肃省武威县黄羊渠灌溉工程，已于十月二十日完工放水。黄羊渠是引黄羊河水灌溉两岸的农田；东西两道干渠共长二十三公里多，灌田十五万五千多亩。这些农田得到灌溉，每年可增产粮食八百万斤。
    ▲绥远省河套地区近代化的黄杨闸灌溉工程，已经在今年九月底修成，明年五月就可放水灌溉二百八十万亩农田。黄杨闸修成，不只可以免除渠水泛滥，而且可以使乌梁海沿岸脱出十万亩耕地。
    ▲中国人民解放军某部今年在新疆北部玛那斯河下游绥来、沙湾以北的一片草原上所开拓的两万亩新棉区，已获得丰收。所产棉花纤维长二十五公厘，可纺四十二支纱，生长期仅一百二十天左右，平均每亩可收皮棉四十至五十市斤，最高达一百零五市斤。现在正是棉收季节，解放军战士们正愉快地收摘自己的劳动成果，并进行了选种工作，准备在明年扩大播种面积和提高产量。
