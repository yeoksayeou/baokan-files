　　Certain Cadres of the Henan Huangchuan Grain Company
　　Serious Bureaucratic Work Styles Creating Extremely Bad Political Influence
　　Editor: The Henan Huangchuan Special District Grain Bureau signed a contract with the Huangchuan Grain Company for receiving trade grain, stipulating that the grain company would be responsible for receiving it, starting from November 1st, with a daily intake of 300,000 jin of grain. The grain depot was located in Shuangliu District, Huangchuan. On the morning of the grain reception day, the grain-delivering masses from ten townships in Shuangliu District successively delivered their grain to the reception point, but Lin Xinliang, the grain receiver of the grain company, had not yet gotten out of bed. Later, the masses entered the courtyard to urge Lin, and Lin was forced to get up. When weighing began, it was handled by a person named Dong Jishu. After weighing a few loads, the masses felt something was wrong. Yuan Jishan's grain from Fuying Township weighed 384 jin at home (old scale), but Dong weighed it at 347 jin (possibly he misread the scale). When Tu Kezhuang, a poor peasant from Pengfan Township, looked at the scale, Dong glared at him and said, "If you think it's high, you come and weigh it." Li Zhengjin from Fuying Township had four taels of rice left in his bamboo basket, and Dong said, "Do you want to steal grain?" At noon, the grain receivers went to eat. But the masses had arrived early in the morning, and they were even hungrier. They requested the grain company to leave two people to weigh the grain, but they said, "Nothing is as important as eating." After saying that, they left. At that time, the masses in Pengfan Township said that the township head shouldn't have let them deliver the grain, and the township head was so angry that he cried. The masses in Ligang Township carried seventeen loads of grain back, saying, "Even if the company accepts it tomorrow, we won't deliver any." The company's grain reception comrades finished eating, and it was almost dark. The masses were afraid of delaying production, so they were even more eager to hand in the grain. At this time, the company's grain receiver became very angry, immediately closed the gate, and simply stopped receiving it. Some people had half of their grain weighed, leaving the other half outside the gate; some people carried the grain home, angrily saying, "Kill me, I won't come again!" Later, Lin Xinliang made a phone call to the person in charge of the company, saying, "The grain can't be received in time." Originally, the contract stipulated a daily intake of 300,000 jin of grain, but only 170,000 jin were received. Many grain-delivering masses had to store their grain in restaurants on the street. This bureaucratic work style of the grain company's grain receiving personnel caused great dissatisfaction among the masses. I think they should conduct a self-criticism.

　　Editor's Note: Certain cadres of the Henan Huangchuan Grain Company, in their grain reception work, displayed an extremely bad bureaucratic work style, creating an extremely bad political influence among the masses. The leadership of the Huangchuan Grain Company should take prompt and effective action on this matter.

　　河南潢川粮食公司某些干部
    官僚主义作风严重造成极坏的政治影响
    编辑同志：河南潢川专区粮食局与潢川粮食公司订立接收贸易粮合同，规定由粮食公司负责接收；从十一月一日开始，每天收粮三十万斤。粮库设在潢川双柳区。收粮那天清早，双柳区十个乡的送粮群众，陆续把粮送到了收粮地点，但粮食公司收粮员林心良还不起床。后来群众都进到院子里催林，林不得已才被迫起床。开始过秤时，由一个名叫董纪树的掌磅。初过几秤后，群众就觉得不对头。傅营乡袁纪山的粮食在家过秤是三百八十四斤（老秤），而董过秤时是三百四十七斤（可能是他看错了磅）。彭畈乡贫农涂克壮看了一下磅，董便把眼一瞪，说：“嫌高了你来秤。”傅营乡李正金的笆斗里剩四两米未倒完，董就说：“你想偷粮吗？”晌午时收粮员都去吃饭。但群众从早晨就来了，他们肚子更饿，要求粮食公司留两人过磅，可是他们却说：“啥也没有吃饭要紧。”说罢扬长而去。当时彭畈乡群众纷纷说乡长不该让他们来送粮，乡长气得直哭。栗岗乡群众把送来的粮又担回十七挑，并说：“明天公司收，一点也不送了。”公司收粮同志吃完饭天已快黑了，群众怕耽误生产，就更急着交粮，这时该公司收粮员大发脾气，马上把大门一闭，干脆就不收了。有的人的粮秤了一半，留了一半在门外；有的人把粮食挑回家，气得说：“杀了我也不来了！”后来林心良给公司负责人打了个电话，还说：“粮食收不及。”原来合同上所订每日收粮三十万斤，结果只收十七万斤。很多送粮群众不得不把粮食寄存在街上饭店里。粮食公司收粮人员这种官僚主义作风引起了群众极大不满。我认为他们应当进行检讨。河南潢川专署财政科　黄金兰
    编者按：河南潢川粮食公司某些干部，在收粮工作中，表现了极度恶劣的官僚主义作风，在群众中造成极坏的政治影响。潢川粮食公司领导方面对此事应作迅速的有效的处理。
