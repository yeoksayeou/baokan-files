    Implementing Military Expansion Policies Arouses Popular Dissatisfaction
    Norwegian Prime Minister Gerhardsen Resigns
    New Prime Minister Has Closer Ties with the American Bloc
    [This Newspaper News] According to Xinhua News Agency: Norwegian Prime Minister Gerhardsen, who has been actively pursuing a policy of military expansion and war preparations and anti-Soviet policies, resulting in increasing dissatisfaction among the Norwegian people, submitted his resignation to the Norwegian King on November 13th. The Norwegian King has appointed another leader of the Labor Party, Torp, as Prime Minister and reorganized the cabinet. This fact proves that the political crisis currently pervading Western Europe has also struck this Nordic country, known for its "stability."
    The Soviet "Pravda" commentator Viktorov pointed out in his commentary on the matter: The new Prime Minister Torp has closer ties with the American imperialist bloc than Gerhardsen. In 1949, he went to the United States with Foreign Minister Lange to assist in the formation of the North Atlantic Group. Torp's succession as Prime Minister shows that the Norwegian ruling group has not drawn the necessary conclusions from the deterioration of Norway's international position and domestic situation. They will continue to use "tough measures" to suppress the growing dissatisfaction of the Norwegian people.

    执行扩军政策引起人民不满
    挪威首相基哈德森辞职
    新首相和美国集团关系更密切
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：由于积极奉行扩军备战政策和反苏政策以致引起挪威人民群众日益不满的挪威首相基哈德森，已于十一月十三日向挪威国王呈请辞职。挪威国王已任命工党的另一领袖托尔普继任首相，重组内阁。这件事实证明目前弥漫西欧的政治危机也已经袭击到这个号称“稳定”的北欧国家。
    苏联“真理报”评论家维克托罗夫在评论此事时指出：新任首相托尔普和美帝国主义集团的关系比基哈德森更加密切。他曾在一九四九年和外交大臣兰基一起赴美协助组成北大西洋集团。托尔普继任首相一事，说明挪威统治集团并未从挪威国际地位和国内情况的恶化中得到应有的结论，他们还要继续用“强硬手段”来抑制挪威人民日益增长的不满。
