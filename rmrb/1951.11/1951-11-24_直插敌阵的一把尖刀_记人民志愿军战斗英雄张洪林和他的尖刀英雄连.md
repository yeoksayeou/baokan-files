A Sharp Knife Thrust into the Enemy Lines
    ——Remembering People's Volunteer Army Combat Hero Zhang Honglin and His Sharp Knife Hero Company
    Wu Ming
    During the rest period, Zhang Honglin's company seized the time to train, and their tactics and combat movements improved rapidly. The soldiers had already submitted letters of request and determination to the company headquarters, eagerly requesting their superiors to give them combat missions.
    The mission finally came: "March urgently for five days, rush to the central front, and join the battle."
    The five-day march covered more than seventy or eighty li each day. It was dark, the roads were narrow, and the ground was covered with deep snow. After a night of walking, people's bodies, backpacks, and even eyebrows and hair were covered with white frost. The troops hid in the mountain gullies during the day. On the fifth day, they crossed seven rivers in a row, and when it was almost dawn, they were only twenty-odd li away from their destination. Company Commander Zhang Honglin stood by the roadside in the dim morning light, watching his company advance. He saw Wang Buxiang, the leader of the second group of the eighth squad, helping others carry five guns and a bag of rice. This simple and honest man in his thirties was constantly running back and forth taking care of the troops. On the day of departure, Zhang Honglin knew that soldier Gu Shanjun of the third squad had a bad foot, and he was walking with a cane, hobbling along. Every time they gathered, he would always say: "I will crawl to the battlefield even if I have to." He saw the company commander looking at him by the roadside, so he simply put the cane on his shoulder, straightened his body, and walked past the company commander.
    At this time, Zhang Honglin was thinking about the battalion commander's order: "Overcome all difficulties and strive to reach the destination by dawn." So he asked the instructor to urge the team from behind. He himself took the lead in the forced march and walked twenty li in one breath.
    When the sun climbed over the mountain peaks, all the comrades of the Seventh Company had reached their destination and began to build fortifications. The morning glow shone on the soldiers' faces, making them look particularly radiant and energetic.
    In the five-day forced march, no one in the entire company fell behind. This was the first step towards victory.
                            ×  ×  ×
    At eight o'clock on the morning of February 11, Zhang Honglin and the instructor were summoned to the battalion headquarters to receive their mission. This day marked the eighteenth day of the enemy's advance, mobilizing 230,000 troops that could be used on the Korean battlefield. The victories achieved by the brother troops on the Han River front inspired all the comrades of the Seventh Company.
    The battalion commander was a twenty-six-year-old youth, a combat hero who broke through the "38th Parallel," and had a high prestige in the entire battalion. The battalion commander called Zhang Honglin to the map, pointed to the map and said to him: "We must wipe out this exposed enemy force – the puppet army's Eighth Division and the U.S. Second Division! We must wipe them out! Now the higher-ups have ordered us to be the 'Sharp Knife Battalion,' to insert ourselves behind enemy lines and cut off the enemy's escape route."
    Three large red characters were marked on the map in red ink – "Guangtiantai."
    "I order the Seventh Company: Comrade Zhang Honglin, your training model company will be the 'Sharp Knife Company.' Insert yourselves into the enemy's position tonight. Sixty li, three large mountains, no roads, and enemy troops stationed everywhere along the way. You must resolutely complete the mission!" The battalion commander's bright eyes looked at Zhang Honglin, who stood with his heels tightly together. The two men stared at each other for a full three minutes.
    "Battalion commander, I – will definitely complete the mission."
    "I believe in you, but the important thing for a commander is – "
    Zhang Honglin continued: "To think deeply and command the entire company."
    The battalion commander said: "And – be decisive! Give full play to the spirit of independent operations."
    Zhang Honglin and the instructor walked out of the battalion headquarters together. The battalion commander's last two sentences still echoed in his ears: "You are the Sharp Knife Company. The entire army's expansion of the victory depends on you."
    He accepted the combat mission, and his spirit became even more tense. He thought: "This mission is as difficult as passing through the tiger's teeth and drilling into the tiger's belly. The enemy is only ten li away. The enemy has built fortifications on every mountain. We must estimate the enemy's blocking and sealing along the way, and enemy tanks may also come out when crossing the highway. Issues such as the treatment of wounded without a rear, and the possibility of losing direction during night marches must be prepared in advance."
    He anticipated seven possible situations and had already prepared six solutions to overcome the difficulties; the last one was the issue of direction. Zhang Honglin touched the luminous compass he had captured in the previous battle in his pocket and said: "I'm counting on you!" Finally, he and the instructor deliberated for a long time before deciding to assign the task of "Sharp Knife Tip" of the "Sharp Knife Company" to the third platoon, which had made the fastest progress in training and had more than half of its members as Party and Youth League members.
    Before twelve noon, the mission had been conveyed specifically and deeply to the soldiers in each squad, and the soldiers were as excited as Zhang Honglin. Zhang Honglin asked each soldier to tie grass ropes to their shoes; and wrap the shovels in cloth to avoid making noise and reflecting light. At five o'clock in the afternoon, the troops braved enemy air raids and advanced towards Guangtiantai.
        The "Sharp Knife Tip" of the "Sharp Knife Company" was the eighth squad, and Zhang Honglin followed closely behind the eighth squad. Everyone's mood became more and more tense as they walked. After climbing over an unknown mountain, they entered a large desolate gully. The large desolate gully was sandwiched between two main peaks, with highway entrances at both the north and south ends. In the middle, a large mountain ridge as high as seven hundred meters rose up. This was a saddle-shaped mountain, and the only small road was covered by heavy snow. Looking up at the sky from the deep gully was like looking at the mouth of a well from the bottom of a well. It was pitch black in front of them, and the eerie mountain wind caused the pine forests on the mountain to sob. The dark, jagged peaks all around protruded like ghosts. The puppet army's Eighth Division had two regiments huddled in the mountain clusters on both sides, and a sudden fierce battle could break out at any time. Zhang Honglin relied on his compass to grasp the direction. He couldn't see the faces of the soldiers in the darkness, but he seemed to know their hearts. As long as he shouted: "The time to realize our determination has come!" even a mountain of knives would be crushed. He thought: if our soldiers rushed up the mountain, our company could wipe out an enemy company, or even a battalion. But our mission is: "To intercept all the enemies, to annihilate entire divisions, and to strive for the victory of the entire campaign. . . "
    These myriad thoughts and the tense mood made Zhang Honglin speed up his pace. They walked quietly, silently passing through this high mountain ridge of seven hundred meters that the enemy considered "foolproof."
    The eighth squad leader, Zhou Xiangshuang, who was walking in the front, suddenly noticed a fire flickering not far ahead. He quickly cocked the trigger. At this time, he heard the enemy shouting at him, and he shouted to the soldiers: "Disperse!"
    He knocked down four enemies in one breath, and then rushed up. Machine gunner Liu Shumu took the opportunity to run to the enemy's side, fired a burst of bullets, knocked down several enemies, and rushed up with the machine gun, capturing four prisoners. Seeing that the third platoon was about to disperse to capture the routed enemies, Zhang Honglin immediately shouted: "Don't forget our mission, a fierce advance is the victory!" So, the troops braved the crisscrossing artillery fire from the mountains on both sides and rushed past. At this time, gunfire also sounded from behind. Zhang Honglin knew that the follow-up troops had caught up.
    This irresistible "sharp knife" knocked down the enemy's three blocking positions along the way, and around nine o'clock, it had inserted itself into the highway fifteen li away from Guangtiantai, opening up the road for the entire assault force to insert itself into the enemy's position.
    At eleven o'clock at midnight, Zhang Honglin led the Seventh Company across the highway, occupied the commanding heights, and cooperated with the Eighth Company to intercept all 140 enemy vehicles and the U.S. Second Division's heavy artillery battalion on the highway.
    "Continue to expand the victory!" The battalion commander received the regiment's order on the radio, ordering the Seventh Company to continue to advance and occupy the large mountain 502 high ground south of Guangtiantai before dawn, completely cutting off the enemy's retreat. But this large mountain, which was more than 500 meters high, was protected by six small peaks, and the intersection of two highways was at the foot of the mountain. There were at least hundreds of enemies on the mountain, and the guard was very strict.
    When Zhang Honglin accepted this mission, it was already four o'clock in the morning. He immediately led the assault platoon to scout the terrain on the front of the mountain, but before he could launch an attack, he was suppressed by the enemy's sudden and intense fire in a depression at the foot of the mountain. A bullet pierced his left arm, and his whole body shook. The platoon leaders asked him to go down, and the medic wanted to bandage him. At this extremely tense moment, he thought: "The motherland has entrusted these hundred-odd outstanding children to me, and I must enable them to fulfill the people's entrustment!" So, he waved away the medic and decisively ordered Yao Yuanben, the special machine gun shooter of the Second Platoon, to quickly fire at the enemy, and the battalion's heavy machine guns to fire at the mountain tops, and hide, to attract the enemy's firepower. He ordered the entire company to quickly pass through the fire net and bypass the enemy's side. He also sent someone to report to the battalion commander: "Give me an hour, and I will take down these seven large and small mountain peaks!"
    "Platoon Leader Wang, I order you to lead your Third Platoon to fight out a heroic platoon, from behind this mountain, clinging to the rocky cliffs, clinging to the branches of trees, you must attack up! Quick!" Sun Zhongtian, this young lad, led his troops and climbed up this 500-meter-high cliff in less than half an hour, and continuously captured two mountain peaks. Zhang Honglin led the First and Second Platoons to follow up. At this time, the enemy on the third mountain opened fire fiercely at them. Zhang Honglin thought: there was only less than half an hour left. If the mountain peaks were attacked one by one, not to mention that the casualties would be great, I'm afraid they wouldn't be able to take them all down before dawn. So he ordered Sun Zhongtian:
    "Third Platoon Leader! Divide into left and right routes to insert into the third mountain peak. I am on the front. Don't care about the prisoners. Drive the enemy towards the fourth mountain peak. Follow closely, don't stop, take advantage of the enemy's unsteady footing, and take down the five mountain peaks in one breath." Sun Zhongtian fully understood the company commander's intention. From the attack on the fourth mountain peak, they no longer attacked one by one, but ran after the fleeing enemy and occupied them. All the enemies on the seven mountain peaks were driven down the mountain into the net we had pre-arranged.
    It was dawn, and the soldiers' cotton-padded clothes were all soaked with sweat. Zhang Honglin sat down on a stone, and only then did he feel the wound in severe pain. At this time, the battalion commander arrived, and he said to Zhang Honglin: "Comrade Zhang Honglin, it's only a minute short of a full hour, but your blood has already stained half of your body red, go down!" Zhang Honglin wanted to stand up and report their achievements in occupying seven mountain peaks, killing and wounding more than 50 enemies, and capturing 16 prisoners alive, but he really lacked the strength and did not stand up. The battalion commander went up to help him and said: "Go down! The mission has been completed!" Zhang Honglin raised his head and looked at the battalion commander:
        "No! Battalion commander, just have the medic bandage me."
    The battalion commander knew his subordinates very well. At this time, he couldn't force him to go down. Zhang Honglin shook and stood up, and walked to his command position again.
                        ×  ×  ×
    After the 502 high ground was occupied by the Seventh Company, the enemy felt the problem was serious; they organized four consecutive assaults, all of which were repelled by the counter-attacks organized by Zhang Honglin.
    However, in the third counter-attack, the "Sharp Knife Squad" lost their most beloved comrade, Wang Buxiang. When Wang Buxiang led a group of people to counter-attack down the mountain, an American soldier raised a carbine and knelt on the ground to surrender to him. He went up to help the guy up, and when he got close, that shameless guy held the trigger of the gun, turned the muzzle, and shot Wang Buxiang in the chest. That guy wanted to raise his gun again, but was shot down by Ding Kanglin, the deputy leader of the Eighth Squad, from afar.
    Zhang Honglin was very sad when he heard that Wang Buxiang had sacrificed. He told the third platoon leader in a heavy voice to convey to all the platoon members: "When the enemy sees that their defeat is irreversible, they will do all kinds of shameless things. Be vigilant! Love ourselves, and do not have any pity for the enemy who holds weapons!"
                            ×  ×  ×
    After twelve noon on the 12th, our army had mobilized troops from all sides and attacked the enemy's position from all directions. The enemy, who had lost their escape route, were like a pile of messy maggots in a cesspool, bumping around everywhere at the foot of the mountain. By seven o'clock in the afternoon, this large-scale mountain encirclement battle had ended victoriously. This was the famous Hengcheng Blockade Battle, in which more than 12,000 enemies were annihilated in one day and night. Comrade Zhang Honglin was the company commander of the "Sharp Knife Hero Company" in the "Sharp Knife Hero Battalion," and he and his Seventh Company were both gloriously awarded two major merits; six people in their company were awarded the "Military Service Medal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea."

    直插敌阵的一把尖刀
    ——记人民志愿军战斗英雄张洪林和他的尖刀英雄连
    吴明
    张洪林连在休整时抓紧练兵，战术和战斗动作飞快地提高了起来。战士们早就纷纷向连部提出请战书、决心书，急切地要求上级给他们作战任务。
    任务终于来了：“急行军五天，赶向中线，投入战斗。”
    五天行军，每天都在七八十里以上。天黑，路窄，遍地都是深厚的积雪。走一夜的路，第二天人们身上、背包上，连眼眉和头发上都沾满了白霜。部队白天就隐蔽在山沟里。第五天接连过了七道河，快天明时，离目的地只有二十多里路。连长张洪林在曚昽的晨曦中站在路旁，看着他的连队前进。他看见八班二组组长王步祥帮别人背了五支枪还有一条米袋，这个朴实淳厚的三十来岁的人，不时跑前跑后在照料部队。出发的那一天，张洪林就知道三班战士顾善郡的脚坏了，他拄着棍子一点一拐地走着。每天集合时他总要说：“爬也要爬到战场上。”他看见了连长在路旁看他，就索性把棍子给扛在肩上，挺直着身子从连长身边走过去。
    这时，张洪林在想营长的命令：“排除万难，争取天明到达目的地。”于是，他让指导员在后边督促着队伍。自己带头急行军前进，一口气就走了二十里。
    当太阳爬出山岗时，七连的全体同志已到达目的地开始构筑工事了。朝霞照在战士们的脸上，格外显得他们红光满面、精神焕发了。
    五天急行军，全连没有一个人掉队。这是走向胜利的第一步。
                            ×  ×  ×
    二月十一日早晨八时，张洪林和指导员被召到营部去接受任务。这一天正是敌人调动了在朝鲜战场上可以动用的兵力二十三万之众，向北进犯的第十八天。汉江前线的兄弟部队所取得的胜利，鼓舞着七连的全体同志们。
    营长是个二十六岁的青年人，突破“三八”线的战斗英雄，在全营有着很高的威信。营长把张洪林叫到地图跟前，指着地图对他说：“这一股暴露的敌人——伪军第八师和美军第二师，我们要吃掉它，一定要吃掉它！现在上级命令我们为‘尖刀营’，要插入敌后，斩断敌人的逃路。”
    地图上用红笔勾画着三个大红字——“广田台”。
    “我命令七连：张洪林同志，你领导的练兵模范连为‘尖刀连’，今夜插入敌人阵地。六十里，三座大山，没有路，沿途到处都驻有敌人。要坚决完成任务！”营长的炯炯发光的眼睛看着张洪林，张洪林两个脚跟扣得很紧地站着。两个人对视足足有三分钟。
    “营长，我——一定完成任务。” “我相信你，但做一个指挥员重要的是——”
    张洪林接着说：“深思熟虑，指挥全连。”
    营长说：“还有——果敢！发挥独立作战的精神。”
    张洪林和指导员一起走出了营部，营长最后的两句话还响在他的耳边：“你们是尖刀连，全军扩大战果就靠你们。”
    他接受了战斗任务，精神更加紧张了。他想：“这个任务，就好像从老虎门牙里穿过，钻入虎肚子里
    一样的困难。十里路以外就是敌人，在每个山头上敌人都筑有工事，必须估计到沿途敌人的阻击和封锁，穿过公路时敌人坦克也可能出动，无后方作战的伤员处理、夜间行军可能摸不准方向等问题都必须事先做好准备工作。
    他预计到七种可能发生的情况，并且已预先安排好了六种解决困难的办法；最后一个是方向问题，张洪林摸了一下口袋里在上次战役缴获来的夜光指南针说：“靠你了！”最后他和指导员又斟酌了好半天，才决定把“尖刀连”的“尖刀排”任务交给在练兵中进步最快、党团员占一半以上的第三排。
    中午十二时以前，任务已具体、深入地传达到了各班战士中，战士们和张洪林一样地兴奋。张洪林叫每个战士在鞋上都绑上草绳；把铁锹用布包上，以免碰响与反光。下午五时，部队冒着敌机的空袭向广田台前进。
        “尖刀连”的“刀尖”是第八班，张洪林就紧跟在八班的后边，每个人的心情都是越走越紧张。翻过一座不知名的大山，就进入一条大荒沟，大荒沟夹在两大主峰的中间，南北两端的沟口都通公路，中间横起一座高达七百公尺的大山脊，这是一个马鞍形的山，仅有的一条小路也被大雪给盖住了。从深沟里仰望天空，就像从井底看井口一样。眼前是一片漆黑，阴森森的山风吹得山上的松林呜咽地响着。四围黑??的峦峰，像鬼怪一样的到处伸出头来。伪军第八师有两个团蜷伏在两侧的山丛中，突然的激战随时都可能在身边发生。张洪林就靠他那个指南针掌握方向。黑暗中他看不见战士们的脸，但他好像知道战士们的心，只要他喊一声：“实现决心的时期到了！”那怕是刀山也要把它冲垮。他在想：我们的战士如果冲上山去，以我们的一个连准可消灭敌人的一个连，甚至一个营。但我们的任务是：“截断全部敌人，整师整师地消灭，争取整个战役的胜利。……”
    这千头万绪的思想和紧张心情使张洪林更加速了脚步。他们静悄悄地走着，无声无息地通过了这座敌人认为“万无一失”的高达七百公尺的大山脊。
    走在最前面的八班长周祥双，他忽然发现前面不远有火光在闪动。他连忙勾住了板机。这时，他听到敌人向他叫喊，他向战士们喊一声：“散开！”
    一口气打倒了四个敌人，随即冲了上去，机枪手刘树木趁机跑到敌人的侧面，一梭子打倒了几个敌人，端着机枪冲上去，捉回四个俘虏来。眼看三排也要散开去捉溃散的敌人，张洪林马上喊了一声：“不要忘记我们的任务，猛插前进，才是胜利！”于是，部队就冒着两边山上交错打下来的炮火，跑步冲过。这时，后边也响起了枪炮声。张洪林知道，这是后续部队跟上来了。
    这一把锐不可当的“尖刀”，沿途又打垮了敌人的三次阻击，九时许已插到离广田台十五里的公路上，打开了整个突击部队插入敌阵的道路。
    午夜十一时，张洪林率领着七连跨过公路，占领制高点，协同八连将敌人的一百四十辆汽车和美军第二师的重野炮营全部截在公路上。
    “继续扩张战果！”营长在报话机中接到团的命令，要七连继续前进，拂晓前要占领广田台南面的大山五○二高地，完全切断敌人的退路。但这座大山，高达五百多公尺，有六座小山峰卫护着它，山下是两条公路的交叉点，山上最少有数百名敌人，戒备很严。
    张洪林接受这任务时。已是早晨四时，他马上率领着突击排去察看山正面的地形，但还没有发起攻击，就被突如其来的敌人的强烈火力压在山脚下一块洼地里。一颗子弹打穿了他的左臂，他全身震动了一下。排长们叫他下去，卫生员要给他包扎。在这紧张万分的时候，他想到：“祖国把这一百多个优秀的子弟交给了我，我要使他们完成人民的嘱托呀！”于是，他挥开了卫生员，果断地命令二排特等机枪射手姚元本向敌人迅速射击，营配属的重机枪向山头射击，并隐蔽起来，吸引敌人的火力。要全连迅速穿过火网，绕向敌人的侧面。他又派人报告营长：“只要一小时，准拿下这七座大小山头！”
    “王排长，命令你率领你的三排打出个英雄排来，从这山背后，扒着石崖，攀着树枝，一定攻上去！快！”孙忠田这个青年小伙子率领着部队，不到半小时就爬上了这五百公尺高的绝壁，并连续攻下两座山头。张洪林率领一、二排跟了上来。这时第三座山上的敌人猛烈地向他们射击起来。张洪林想：只有不到半小时的时间了，如果山头一个个攻下去，不要说伤亡会大，怕天明也不能全拿下来。于是他就命令孙忠田：
    “三排长！分左右两路向第三个山头插，我在正面，不要管俘虏，把敌人赶向第四个山头，紧跟下去，不要停，趁敌人立脚不稳，五个山头要一气拿下。”孙忠田完全了解连长的意图。从攻第四个山头起，他们再不是一个个地攻下，而是跑步跟着逃敌占领下来的。七个山头上的敌人都被他们全部赶向山下我们预先布置好的天罗地网之中。
    天明了，战士的棉衣全被汗水湿透了。张洪林一下坐到一块石头上，才感到伤口在剧痛。这时，营长赶来了，他对张洪林说：“张洪林同志，只差一分钟整一小时，但是，你的血已染红了你的半个身子，你下去吧！”张洪林想站起来报告他们攻占七个山头、杀伤敌人五十多名、活捉十六个俘虏的战绩，但他实在缺乏力气，没有站起来。营长上去扶着他说：“下去吧！任务已经完成了！”张洪林抬起头看着营长：
        “不！营长，卫生员给我包扎一下就行了。”
    营长很了解他的部下，在这个时候是不能硬叫他下去的。张洪林摇晃着站了起来，又走向他的指挥位置。
                        ×  ×  ×
    五○二高地被七连占领后，敌人感到问题严重了；他们连续组织四次冲锋，都被张洪林组织的反冲锋打退了。
    但是，在第三次反冲锋时，“刀尖班”失去了他们最可爱的战友王步祥同志。当王步祥带领一组人反击冲下山时，一个美国兵高举着卡宾枪，跪在地上向他投降，他上去想扶起那个家伙，走到跟前，那个无耻的家伙，却手握着枪的扳机，一转枪口，射中了王步祥的胸膛。那家伙还想再举枪，却被八班副丁康林远远地一枪打倒了。
    张洪林听到王步祥牺牲了，非常难过。他沉痛地告诉三排长传达给全排人：“敌人当他们的失败不可挽救的时候，什么样无耻的事情也会做出来。警惕呀！爱我们自己，对手执武器的敌人不能有一点的怜悯！”
                            ×  ×  ×
    十二日中午十二时以后，我军已调齐了各方面的兵力，从四面八方攻向敌阵。失去了逃路的敌人像粪坑里的一堆乱蛆，在山下到处乱撞。到下午七时，这个大规模的山地围歼战就胜利结束了。这就是著名的一昼夜歼敌一万二千多人的横城阻击战。张洪林同志就是“尖刀英雄营”中的“尖刀英雄连”连长，他和他的第七连都光荣地被记了两大功；他们连里并有六个人获得了“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国军功章”。
