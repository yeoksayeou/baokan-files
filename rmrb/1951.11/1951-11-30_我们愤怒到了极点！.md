    We Are Enraged to the Extreme!
    Editor: After reading the article "Korean People's Army Soldier Kim Jun-geun Accuses American Aggressors of Torturing and Killing Our Captured Personnel," published in the People's Daily on November 26th, all the students in our class were enraged to the extreme. The American bandits, on the one hand, shamelessly fabricated lies about the "killing of prisoners" by the Chinese and Korean People's forces, and on the other hand, they brutally used captured personnel of the Chinese and Korean People's armies as targets for shooting practice, burned them with fire, used poisonous mosquitoes to bite them, steamed them with steam, and even used them for germ warfare experiments. This is a completely barbaric atrocity inheriting the mantle of the German and Japanese fascist bandits. We lodge a serious protest against this and want to accuse the American imperialist aggressors of this inhuman and insane behavior to the people of the world. The captured personnel of the Chinese and Korean People's armies must not be subjected to unwarranted abuse and killing. The American imperialists must bear full responsibility for the consequences of this behavior. If the American bandits dare to continue their insane policy of massacre, they will surely be subjected to just sanctions before the people of the world.

    我们愤怒到了极点！
    编辑同志：当我们读了十一月二十六日人民日报所刊的朝鲜人民军战士金俊根同志控诉美国侵略者虐杀我军被俘人员一文后，全班同学愤怒到了极点。美国强盗一方面无耻地捏造什么中朝人民部队“杀害俘虏”的谎言，一方面自己却在残暴地把中朝人民军队的被俘人员当枪靶子、用火烧、用毒蚊咬、用蒸汽蒸、甚至用来作细菌武器实验。这完全是继承德、日法西斯强盗衣钵的野蛮暴行，我们对此提出严重的抗议，并且要向全世界人民控诉美帝国主义侵略者这种惨无人道的疯狂行为。中朝人民军队的被俘人员决不容许遭受无辜虐待与杀害。美帝国主义者要对这种行为的后果，负担全部责任。如果美国强盗们还敢于继续进行疯狂的屠杀政策，它们就一定要在全世界人民面前受到正义的制裁。
