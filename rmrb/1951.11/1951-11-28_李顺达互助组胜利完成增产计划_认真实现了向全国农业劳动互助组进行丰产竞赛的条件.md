Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, November 27th: The Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team in Shanxi Province has victoriously completed their production plan this year, fulfilling the conditions for launching a high-yield competition with agricultural labor mutual aid teams nationwide.

In agricultural production, this spring they proposed: guaranteeing a yield of 378 jin of grain per mu, an increase of 21 jin over last year, exceeding the pre-war average yield per mu by 108.4 percent. This year, the entire team cultivated 71.6 mu of grain crops such as corn and millet, with an actual harvest of 27,351 jin of various grains, averaging 382 jin per mu, exceeding the original plan and exceeding the pre-war average yield per mu by 109.9 percent. Their more than 30 mu of corn yielded an average of 410 jin per mu, and more than 30 mu of millet yielded an average of 353 jin per mu, both approximately twice as high as the general yield in the area. Last year, Li Shunda created a record of harvesting 980 jin of corn per mu. Although this year there were uneven periods of drought and flood, Li Shunda still harvested 1,215 jin of corn from 1.5 mu of land, equivalent to 810 jin per mu. Regarding sideline production, the original plan was to plant 10 mu of codonopsis pilosula and afforest 40 mu, increase draft animals by two head, sheep by 23, and pigs by two. Except for the increase in sheep, which was not completed due to the large spring snow locally and the lack of fodder causing some sheep to die, all other items have been completed. For afforestation: they planted 374 trees in the spring and afforested 50 mu in the autumn. In addition, they planted 370 walnut trees, greatly exceeding the plan.

The "three cultivations and three weedings," the use of new farm tools, soil improvement, and seed selection and soaking, all proposed by the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team in their challenge letter, have been implemented. Selecting superior varieties, using new farm tools, and increasing fertilizer application are the three key factors for the mutual aid team's increased production this year. This year, they planted all good seeds that had been selected, and all seeds were disinfected by soaking or treating with copper sulfate. Half of the team's autumn fields were cultivated with new-style farm tools this year, increasing the depth and efficiency of cultivation by 30 percent. The amount of fertilizer applied per mu of autumn field increased by 30 percent compared to last year, and the quality of the fertilizer was also higher than last year. In addition, 17 mu of land have already been improved. The technical team and small farm within the mutual aid team have played a significant role in promoting increased production. The technical team promoted the entire team to study cultivation techniques according to the season, frequently using examples to compare the advantages and disadvantages of new and old cultivation methods, promoting team members to use sprayers to eliminate insects, and pulling out corn smut and millet head smut diseased plants, etc.

The Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team successfully completed their production increase plan because they earnestly implemented several guarantees they proposed in their challenge letter. First, their patriotic self-education has become regularized: the entire team attends civil school once every three days, reads the newspaper once every five days, and also regularly organizes study discussions at noon or in the evening. There are three propagandists in the team who regularly carry out propaganda and mobilization work. In this way, all team members understand the great significance of resisting America and aiding Korea to defend the motherland, establishing the idea that patriotism and prosperity are consistent, and the political atmosphere and production enthusiasm in the team are constantly full. This year, in order to complete patriotic donations, the total value of wasteland reclamation and increased production reached more than one million yuan. In addition to paying 512,000 yuan in donations, there was a surplus. The yield of the land they cultivated on behalf of the families of martyrs and revolutionary soldiers was the same as that of the entire team.

Second, over the past year, the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team has further strengthened its organization and planning in production. Each season and each household formulates a specific plan based on the overall plan, and clear competition conditions are set between team members. The entire team checks these plans and conditions every five or ten days, and summarizes and evaluates each season. Therefore, the plan can always be completed on time or even ahead of schedule. This year, they completed spring plowing and sowing thirty days earlier than last year, and completed summer weeding seven days earlier than planned. Regarding the use of labor, they made a more rational division of labor this year based on each person's skills, thus saving more than 200 man-days in spring and summer production, which were used to repair cultivated land and complete the plan for increased production donations.

Third, this year, the democratic life within the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team is even more sound. They adopt timely reviews, timely criticism, and self-criticism to ensure the unity of the entire team. After team members Wei Lixing and Han Xuelan had a dispute over the use of public farm tools, the entire team immediately held a meeting to ask them to review, so that the problem was quickly resolved, and a method for using and storing public farm tools was established. The mutual aid team pays great attention to cultivating activists to become core team members, and models are selected for evaluation in each season's summary evaluation.

    李顺达互助组胜利完成增产计划
    认真实现了向全国农业劳动互助组进行丰产竞赛的条件
    【新华社太原二十七日电】山西省李顺达互助组今年胜利地完成了他们的生产计划，完成了他们向全国农业劳动互助组进行丰产竞赛的条件。
    在农业生产上，今年春天他们提出：保证每亩产粮三百七十八斤，比去年增产二十一斤，超过战前每亩平均产量百分之一百零八点四。今年，他们全组共种玉米、谷子等粮食作物七十一亩六分，实收各种粮食两万七千三百五十一斤，平均每亩产粮三百八十二斤，超过了原订的计划，超过战前每亩平均产量百分之一百零九点九。他们所种的三十多亩玉蜀黍，平均每亩收四百一十斤，三十多亩谷子平均每亩收三百五十三斤，都比当地的一般产量约高一倍。去年，李顺达曾创造每亩收九百八十斤玉米的纪录，今年虽然旱涝不均，李顺达还是有一亩半玉蜀黍收了一千二百十五斤玉米，每亩合八百一十斤。副业生产方面原计划种党参十亩，造林四十亩，增加耕畜两头、羊二十三只和猪两只。除了增加羊的计划，因当地春雪大缺乏饲草羊只死去一些，以致没有完成以外，其余各项都已完成。造林一项：他们春季植树三百七十四株，秋季造林五十亩，另外还种了三百七十棵胡桃树，大大地超过了计划。
    李顺达互助组在挑战书中所提的三耕三锄、使用新农具、改良土壤、选种浸种等等，都作到了。选种优良品种、使用新农具和增施肥料是该互助组今年增产的三个关键。今年他们种的都是经过评选的好种籽，而且都是用浸种或王铜拌种方法消过毒的。全组有一半秋田今年用新式农具耕种，耕的深度和耕作的效率都提高了百分之三十。每亩秋田的施肥量比去年增加了百分之三十，肥料质量也比去年高。另外还有十七亩地已经过改良土壤。互助组中的技术小组和小农场，在推动增产上起的作用不小。技术小组按季节推动全组研究耕作技术，经常用实例来比较新旧耕作法的好坏，推动组员使用喷雾器除虫，拔除玉蜀黍黑穗病和谷子白发病病株等等。
    李顺达互助组顺利地完成了他们的增产计划，是因为他们认真地实现了他们在挑战书上所提的几项保证。第一、他们的爱国主义自我教育已经经常化了：全组每三天到民校上课一次，每五天读报一次，还经常在晌午或晚间组织学习讨论，组内有三个宣传员经常进行宣传鼓动工作。这样，全组组员都懂得了抗美援朝保卫祖国的伟大意义，在生产上建立了爱国和发家一致的思想，组内的政治空气和生产热情经常是饱满的。今年他们为了完成爱国捐献，开荒增产的总值达一百多万元，除了缴纳捐献款项五十一万二千元外还有余。他们给烈士家属和革命军人家属代耕的土地，产量和全组是一样的。
    第二、一年来，李顺达互助组进一步加强了生产上的组织性和计划性。每一个季节和每一户都根据总的计划订出具体的计划，组内组员和组员之间都订了明确的竞赛条件。每五天或十天全组根据这些计划和条件检查一次，每一季节总结和评比一次。因此，计划总能按时甚至提前完成。今年他们完成春耕播种的时间比去年缩短了三十天，完成夏锄的时间比原计划缩短了七天。在劳动力的使用方面，他们今年根据各人的技术作了更合理的分工，因而在春、夏两季生产中共节约了二百多个人工，用来整修了耕地和完成了增产捐献的计划。
    第三、今年，李顺达互助组的组内民主生活更加健全，他们采取及时检讨、及时的批评和自我批评来保证了全组的团结。组员魏理兴和韩雪兰因使用公共农具发生争执后，全组马上就开会叫他们检讨，使问题迅速解决，并订了个使用和保管公共农具的办法。互助组很注意培养积极分子成为骨干组员，每一个季节的总结评比都要评选模范。
