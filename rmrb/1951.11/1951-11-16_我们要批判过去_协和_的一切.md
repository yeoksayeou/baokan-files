　　We Must Criticize Everything About the Past "Peking Union Medical College"
    Deng Jia Dong, Chief Physician of Internal Medicine, Peking Union Medical College

   Since the teacher study movement unfolded in universities in Beijing and Tianjin, the teachers of the China Peking Union Medical College have also enthusiastically engaged in study. Generally, they recognize that they should connect with themselves and combine with reality to achieve the effect of ideological remolding. In Peking Union Medical College, there are many practical problems worthy of our review. The need for reform in Peking Union Medical College and the need for transformation of teachers in Peking Union Medical College should be greater than those of teachers in other schools, because Peking Union Medical College was undoubtedly a stronghold of American imperialist cultural aggression in the past, and many teachers were once tools of this cultural aggression. Since the liberation of the mainland of China, especially since Peking Union Medical College returned to the embrace of the people, teachers have generally made progress. However, we have progressed too slowly! Not enough! We don't seem to dare to face many practical problems, let alone examine them. I think this situation must be broken through before our study can move forward. Self-criticism, how easy is it! But we must learn to master this weapon. I am a graduate of Peking Union Medical College and have worked in the school for many years. Because I have not studied enough, I am now going to criticize all aspects of Peking Union Medical College. Of course, it is impossible to be very thorough. But at least I am willing to put forward some questions first to make a beginning for our ideological struggle.

    The past Peking Union Medical College was special. It was established by American capitalists with a small portion of their exploitation gains. If it were not for the fact that its buildings were on our land, the patients it received and most of the staff were our compatriots, it could be said to be a purely American institution. Its architecture was special, its system was special, its education was special, its atmosphere was special... everything was special. After being nurtured in such an environment for at least five years, the students thought they were special, and they were indeed special. When they worked hard in various church universities to complete their pre-medical studies and were admitted to Peking Union Medical College, in addition to privately rejoicing and admiring in their hearts, they often thought that Peking Union Medical College was "great" and therefore could not see the greatness of the motherland. This is just the first lesson. After that, five years of warm window (not cold window) exchanged for a Ph.D. diploma with an American imperialist trademark, so it was special everywhere: claiming to have special knowledge, holding special vision, willing to do special careers and be special people.

    The first special point that the people of Peking Union Medical College thought they could be proud of was its "standard." Because of pride, they guarded it to the death and refused to change it. What is the content of this special standard? First, let's talk about its education and administrative system. The people who formulated these systems at the beginning had thought deeply. But it can be said with certainty that what they based on was not China's but the United States' needs, not China's but the United States' environmental conditions, and even less China's policies and laws. Does this system have advantages? Yes. From the standpoint of Americans and from the perspective of Americans, there are many advantages! It represents the aggression of imperialist politics and economy and the policy of enslaving colonies, full of poison. This is exactly what the imperialists wanted. Under this system, racial discrimination, labor exploitation, economic oppression, and even open and secret struggles, hypocrisy and deceit between people are constantly nurtured. The people who set up Peking Union Medical College wanted to boast to the Chinese people with such a standard system, and further wanted to promote it in our country. This is the sinister conspiracy of American imperialist cultural aggression.

    Secondly, look at its curriculum. Peking Union Medical College is registered and established in the Graduate School of the University of New York, so its curriculum must meet the standards of New York. Any changes must be approved, otherwise not only the doctoral diploma will be a problem, but how will the graduates be "standard" enough! Because it meets the standards, graduates can directly enter American medical research institutes. With this "international standard," they can "have no one else in their eyes" in China and regard themselves as special people. They have many opportunities to obtain important positions in health administration or medical education institutions. These graduates can spread American knowledge along with American ideas and styles in our country at will. They are voluntary promoters of pro-American and worship-American ideas and American lifestyles. How much contribution have they made in technical knowledge? And how many sins of these cultural poisons? People of Peking Union Medical College! We shouldn't gild our faces. Now is the time to boldly admit our sins.

    What is considered equally "proud" as the curriculum standard is research work. Does Peking Union Medical College have achievements in research work? Yes. Most of their research reports are published in foreign countries (especially the United States), and some are published in China (mostly in English!). These research reports can compete with foreign countries, which is something to be proud of! But, how many of these studies have solved problems related to the health and hygiene of our people? Has this question ever been considered? They emphasize interest and freedom. The more remote and esoteric the problem, the more likely it is to be considered valuable for research. This is completely in line with the tastes of American imperialists. The main function of this research work is to increase the researcher's worth. How many research reports have truly helped improve the level of medical science in our country? How many have helped improve the happiness of the vast people of our country? Very few!

    Finally, let's talk about the style of study at Peking Union Medical College. In the past, students of Peking Union Medical College were known for their hard work and tense work. Is this a good style of study? On the surface, it is very good. But, let's investigate our motives. What are we doing this for? If I say that most of them are for the sake of climbing up, becoming experts, being sent abroad, and being in a special class in the future, it is not too wrong, right? Yes, some of us have been determined from the beginning to dedicate ourselves to medical education and medical research. Are these people also thinking more about their personal careers and less about the objects of service? In the process of our personal career development, are we still considering personal fame and fortune as the main issues? The students have spent more than five years from the leaders to be influenced by the American individualistic lifestyle. These leaders often encourage students to work hard behind closed doors and go their separate ways. Therefore, students become more typical good students in the eyes of the old society, super-social, super-political, and even super-national. Our school has trained sixty-one graduates in the past thirty years, of whom fifty-four are still attached to the "civilization" of imperialism and leisurely in the enemy's country; recently, a graduate, under the pretext of going abroad for further study, even took his wife and children to embrace imperialism. Is this something to be proud of?

    Today, the administrative leaders of Peking Union Medical College must put down this burden as soon as possible and reform the leadership work. But to this day, the phenomenon of each doing his own thing still exists in Peking Union Medical College. The leaders have never made a comprehensive plan, let alone seriously responded to the call of the People's Government to seek solutions to many urgent medical and health problems of the vast people. The organization therapy has not yet aroused the attention of the professors. The comrades responsible for administrative leadership do not even know who is responsible for doing the organization therapy work. When the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government holds meetings, they casually send a few people to attend.

    The above is only a small part of many practical problems. Today, I think the teachers of Peking Union Medical College should link these and other issues in their study to examine their own thoughts. Two years ago, in the professor's dinner party, I myself emphasized maintaining the curriculum standards of Peking Union Medical College and maintaining the special education system of Peking Union Medical College. Before liberation, I also thought I had medical "ethics" and secretly proud. More than two years later, today, I dare not indulge in the past, I clearly realize that I need a big transformation. I want to deeply criticize my own thoughts in this study movement, and I am more willing to further criticize everything about the past Peking Union Medical College with all the teachers of Peking Union Medical College!

### 我们要批判过去“协和”的一切

　　我们要批判过去“协和”的一切
    中国协和医学院内科主任医师  邓家栋
   自从教师学习运动在北京、天津各大学展开以来，中国协和医学院的教师们也热烈地进行了学习。一般都认识到应该联系自己，结合实际，才能得到思想改造的效果。在协和，值得我们检讨的实际问题是很多的。协和的需要改革和协和教师们的需要改造，比之其他学校的教师们，应有过而无不及，因为协和在过去无疑地是美帝国主义文化侵略的堡垒，而许多教师们又都曾经是这文化侵略的工具。自从全国大陆解放以来，尤以自协和投归人民的怀抱以来，教师们一般地是有进步的。但是，我们进步得太慢了！太不够了！许多实际问题，我们似乎还不敢正视，更谈不到检讨。我认为这种局面必须突破，然后我们的学习才能前进一步。自我批评，谈何容易！但这一武器我们必须学习掌握。我是协和的毕业生，又在本校工作多年，因为学习得不够，现在就要来批评协和的各方面，当然不可能很透彻的。但至少我愿意先提出一些问题来为我们的思想斗争作一个开端。
    过去的协和是特殊的。它是美国大资本家拿他剥
    削所得的九牛一毛来设立的。若不是因为它的建筑
    是在我们的国土之上，它所收容的病人和大部分工作人员是我们的同胞，它尽可以说是一个纯粹的美
    国机构。它的建筑特殊，制度特殊，教育特殊，风气特殊，……一切都是特殊。学生们在这样的环境中经过至少五年以上的薰陶之后，自以为特殊，也确实是特殊。当他们在各教会大学辛辛苦苦读完医学预科而考上了协和之时，私自庆幸与内心羡慕之余，往往就以为协和是“伟大”的因而看不见祖国的伟大。这不过是第一课。此后五载暖窗（不是寒窗）换取一张美帝国主义商标的博士文凭，于是无往而不特殊：自命有特殊的学问，抱特殊的眼光，愿做特殊的事业而为特殊的人物。
    被协和的人们认为可以骄傲的第一个特殊之点就是它的“标准”。因为骄傲，故死守而不肯改。这个特殊标准的内容是什么？首先谈一谈它的教育和行政制度。当初订定这些制度的人们是曾深思熟虑的。但可以肯定地说，他们所根据的不是中国的而是美国的需要，不是中国的而是美国的环境条件，更不是中国的政策法令。这制度有没有优点呢？有的。在美国人的立场，拿美国人的眼光来看，优点多得很！它代表着帝国主义政治经济的侵略以及奴化的殖民地政策，充满了毒素。这正是帝国主义者所要求的。在这种制度之下，种族的歧视，劳动的剥削，经济的压迫，以至于人与人间的明争暗斗、虚伪奸诈，是经常滋育着的。设立协和的人们想拿这样的标准制度来夸耀于中国人民之前，并进一步要在我们的国土上推广，这是美帝国主义文化侵略的毒辣阴谋。
    其次，看它的课程。协和是在美国纽约州大学院注册立案的，所以它的课程一定得合乎纽约的标准。任何更改必须得到批准，否则不仅博士文凭要成问题，毕业生不够“标准”将如何得了！因为合乎标准，所以毕业生能直入美国的医学研究院。凭这个“国际标准”，他们在国内可以“目无余子”而以特殊人物自居。他们有很多的机会在卫生行政或医学教育机关之中得到重要的位置。这些毕业生可以把美国的学问连同美国的思想与作风任情地在我们国土上传布。他们是亲美崇美思想和美国生活方式的义务推销员。他们在技术知识方面的贡献有多少？而这些文化毒害的罪恶又多少？协和的人们！我们不该在自己的脸上贴金了。现在该是大胆地承认罪过的时候了。
    与课程标准同样被认为可以“骄傲”的是研究工作。协和的研究工作有成绩吗？有的。他们的研究报告大多数是在外国（特别是美国）发表的，一部分是在国内发表的（用英文的多！）。这些研究报告竟能与外国的相抗衡，该是多么值得骄傲的事！但是，这些研究解决了多少有关于我国人民健康卫生的问题呢？这问题曾否被考虑过呢？他们强调兴趣与自由。越是偏僻的牛角尖式的问题，越常被认为有研究的价值。这是完全合乎美国帝国主义者的口胃的。这种研究工作的主要作用是使研究者的身价提高了。有几篇研究报告是确确实实帮助提高了我国医药科学的水平的？有几篇曾帮助增进了我国广大人民的幸福的？少得很！
    最后，谈一谈协和的学风。以往协和的学生是以用功读书紧张工作出名的。这是不是好的学风呢？表面看来是很好。但是，要追究一下我们的动机。我们这样做为的是什么？假如我说，大多数为的是自己可以往上爬，成专家，派出洋，将来可以居于特殊阶级的地位，不见得过于冤枉吧？是的，我们当中曾有些人自始立志献身于医学教育及医学研究。这些人是不是也在个人的事业上着想得多些，而在服务的对象上着想得少呢？在我们的个人事业发展过程中，我们所考虑的是不是仍然以个人的名与利为主要问题？同学们用了五年以上的时间从领导者耳濡目染到的是美国个人自由主义的生活方式。这些领导者经常鼓励学生们闭户用功，各奔前程。因而同学们就多成为典型的旧社会眼光中的好学生，超社会，超政治，甚至于超国家。我校三十年来培养了六十一个毕业生，其中有五十四人到现在仍眷恋着帝国主义的“文明”而逍遥在敌人的国土上；最近有一个毕业生藉口出国深造，竟偕妻挈子投向帝国主义的怀抱里去。这是值得骄傲的吗？
    今天，协和的行政领导同志必须及早放下这个包袱，改革领导工作。但到今天为止，协和还存在着各自为政的现象，领导方面从来没有好好地作一个通盘的计划，更没有认真地响应人民政府的号召，为广大人民的许多迫切的医药健康问题寻求解决的方法。组织疗法至今还没有引起教授们的重视，负责行政领导工作的同志竟不知道谁在负责做组织疗法的工作；中央人民政府卫生部召开会议时随便派几个人去应差。
    以上所提到的不过许多实际问题中的一小部分。在今天，我认为协和的教师们应当在学习中联系着这些和其他问题来检讨我们自己的思想。两年前在教授餐叙会中我自己就曾强调维持协和的课程标准，保持协和的特殊教育制度。解放前我也曾自以为颇有医学“道德”而暗自骄傲。两年余后的今日，我不敢再陶醉于既往，我清楚地认识到我需要大大的改造。我要在这次学习运动中深刻地批判我自己的思想，更愿与协和所有的教师们进一步来批判过去协和的一切！
