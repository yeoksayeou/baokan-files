    Mobilizing All Forces to Unleash the Potential of Industry
    --The Northeast Working Class Strives to Exceed the Target of Increasing Production and Practicing Economy by Five Million Tons of Grain!
    State-owned and publicly-operated factories and mines in Northeast China have extensively conducted ideological education to thoroughly implement Comrade Gao Gang's call to increase production and practice economy by five million tons of grain for the country, making preparations for increasing production and practicing economy, and turning it into a broad mass movement. This is the director of the Northeast Rubber Factory No. 4 giving a report at an enlarged meeting of the factory, responding to Comrade Gao Gang's call.
    In response to Comrade Gao Gang's call to increase production and practice economy worth five million tons of grain wealth for the country on the basis of completing the original production plan, the Northeast working class is determined to mobilize all forces, unleash the potential of industry, and guarantee the overfulfillment of this glorious political task. By the end of September, the staff and workers of the factories and mines under the Northeast People's Government's Industrial Department alone had increased production and practiced economy worth 6.8 million tons of grain wealth. This is a propaganda worker explaining the basic spirit of Comrade Gao Gang's call at a production increase plan discussion meeting of all workers in the Sixth Workshop of Northeast Machinery Factory No. 2.
    In the movement to overfulfill the target of increasing production and practicing economy, all the staff and workers of the Shenyang Smelting Plant generally signed liaison contracts in each workshop, solving many problems of mutual coordination and consistency, and successfully completing the plan stipulated in the liaison contracts and collective contracts to increase production and practice economy by 115,976 tons of grain for the whole year. This is the scene of the Repair Department of the plant signing a liaison contract.
    Factories and mining enterprises in Northeast China have generally adopted the leadership method of combining the contract system with patriotic covenants of groups, giving full play to the creativity and enthusiasm of the workers, fully tapping the internal potential of factories and mining enterprises, and overcoming the viewpoints of antagonism between workers, and between labor and technology. This is the scene of all the workers in the Liu Jinggui Group of Northeast Rubber Factory No. 4 discussing and revising the patriotic covenant.
    In the movement to increase production and practice economy, the Han Dexiang Group of the Third Workshop of Northeast Machinery Factory No. 2 was able to maintain the product quality at 99.5% and sometimes even raise it to 100% because the master could patiently teach the apprentice the technology. This is an old technician from the Han Dexiang Group patiently introducing the technical experience of manufacturing sand-cast gearboxes.
    In the movement to increase production and practice economy, the Han Xiangkun Group of the Sixth Workshop of Northeast Machinery Factory No. 2 implemented a defective product tracing system to ensure strengthened technical research and improved product quality, stipulating that an improvement technology research meeting be held once a week. This is the technical research meeting of the Han Xiangkun Group. They are studying the causes of defective products.
     In order to rationally stipulate the usage and reserve quotas of raw materials, prevent the backlog of raw materials and products, and accelerate the turnover of working capital, state-owned and publicly-operated factories and mines in Northeast China strictly implemented the warehouse inspection system. This is an inspector from Northeast Rubber Factory No. 4 conducting warehouse cleanup work.
    The workers of the Sixth Workshop of Northeast Machinery Factory No. 2 have a clear understanding of cost accounting by calculating detailed accounts, thus saving raw materials for the country and reducing product costs by a great deal.
    As a result of the joint research of Li Qingzhi, director of the calendering workshop, Chen Shoufang, a worker, and the factory director of Northeast Rubber Factory No. 4, labor organization was improved and an assembly line operation method was implemented. Eleven machines were operated by four people instead of five, and the entire workshop could save eighteen technicians, increasing the productivity of each shift by 40%.
    Mei Bin, an old worker in the fitter team of the car and fitter workshop of Northeast Machinery Factory No. 6, worked hard and meticulously in the movement to strive to overfulfill the task of increasing production and practicing economy, and successively found three "tricks," gloriously winning three "trick" red flags, increasing his personal daily output by 20%.
    In the movement to strive to overfulfill the task of increasing production and practicing economy, the Northeast working class launched a "find tricks" movement to improve work efficiency and fully unleash the potential of industry.
    This is the scene of Gao Guangzhen, a worker in the lathe team of the car and fitter workshop of Northeast Machinery Factory No. 6, who first found the "trick," working hard.
    In the movement to increase production and practice economy, the Northeast working class has displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm and accumulated huge wealth for the country; in order to save raw materials for the country, workers in various factories and mining enterprises have tried their best to use waste materials for reproduction. This is the scene of workers in the production team of the Sixth Workshop of Northeast Machinery Factory No. 2 picking out usable iron from the pile of scrap iron left over from the puppet Manchukuo and smashing it in preparation for refining it into good steel.
    On the anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' departure for war, Northeast workers wrote letters to the Volunteer soldiers, reporting on the brilliant achievements in the movement to increase production and practice economy. This is the scene of workers in the lathe team of the car and fitter workshop of Northeast Machinery Factory No. 6 writing letters to the Chinese People's Volunteers.
    In the movement to increase production and practice economy in Northeast China, the director of the Shenyang Paper Mill No. 6 personally led and organized a research team to increase production and practice economy, went deep into the scene, marked the effectiveness of each machine, widened the area of ​​the paper, and unleashed the potential of machine equipment.
    Liang Zhiping, a worker in the lathe team of the First Workshop of Northeast Machinery Factory No. 2, studied the high-speed cutting method. In the movement to increase production and practice economy, he closely combined with technicians, researched and improved the rack of the lathe, creating a new record of increasing from 64 revolutions to 136 revolutions, promoting it throughout the workshop, and increasing productivity by four times.
