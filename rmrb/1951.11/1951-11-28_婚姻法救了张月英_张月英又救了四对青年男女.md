    The Marriage Law Saved Zhang Yueying, and Zhang Yueying Saved Four Young Couples
    In Xiajingang Village, Fourth District, Huangchuan County, Henan Province, there was a woman named Zhang Yueying. When she was eight years old, her father, Zhang Shidao, betrothed her to the Yu Chengxi family in Jiaoshu Township, Seventh District, for six *shi* of rice as a bride price. The following spring, he sent her to the Yu family to be a child bride. As soon as she entered the Yu family, her in-laws disliked her, finding fault with the way she sat or stood. They made her work constantly, barely fed her, and beat and scolded her all the time. Later, she couldn't bear the hardship any longer and secretly ran back to her parents' home.

    After the promulgation of the Marriage Law, the comrades working in the village constantly promoted it. Zhang Yueying listened, thought of her own situation, and sometimes shed tears. On October 3rd last year, when it was market day, Zhang Yueying went to the market to sell spun thread and again heard people explaining the Marriage Law. She was very excited, walking along and thinking, "With the Marriage Law, I have a way out. Alive, I won't be a member of the Yu family; dead, I won't be a ghost of the Yu family..." After returning home, Zhang Yueying proposed to her father that she wanted to break off the engagement with the Yu family. Her father was furious and scolded her for "ruining the reputation of the Zhang family." Zhang Yueying made up her mind, and while her father was away, she went to Nancun to find the female cadre working in that village. That female cadre told her, "You must make your own decisions about your marriage." This gave her courage. Early the next morning, Zhang Yueying ran to the Luoxinlou District Office to apply for the dissolution of the marriage contract, and the District Office approved her request. Her father, upon learning this, cursed incessantly and locked her in the room. On the afternoon of the third day, Wang Zhenlin, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch in Fanjiasi Township, came to Xiajingang Village on business. He learned about Zhang Yueying being locked up and went to find Zhang Shidao. As soon as they met, Zhang Shidao said, "Comrade Wang, a daughter can't be controlled by her parents when she grows up! She secretly went to the district to break off the engagement with the Yu family, truly shameless. I must suppress her madness..." Wang Zhenlin carefully explained the reasons to him, and Zhang Yueying also came out of the room and said, "Can you bear to see your own daughter being beaten and abused in someone else's home? Are you really not heartbroken? Do you want to watch your own daughter die before your eyes? Think carefully!" Comrade Wang Zhenlin continued, "After liberation, you stood up, and you must let your daughter stand up too!" Zhang Shidao finally understood and nodded, standing up to say, "Chairman Mao saved our whole family, and now I can't bear to see my own flesh and blood suffer. Let her handle her own affairs."

    Zhang Yueying was free. She joined the women's association and worked very actively. She promoted the Marriage Law with particular enthusiasm. Last December, Zhang Yueying married freely. In addition, four other young couples, influenced by Zhang Yueying, also married freely. Everyone said, "The Marriage Law saved Zhang Yueying, and Zhang Yueying saved four couples!"

    婚姻法救了张月英  张月英又救了四对青年男女
    河南潢川县第四区夏金岗村有个妇女叫张月英。在她八岁时，她爹张世道为了六石稻的聘礼，把她许给了七区角树乡的喻成喜家。第二年春天，又把她送到喻家当童养媳。一进喻家门，公婆便看不顺眼，不是嫌她坐不正，就是说她站得歪。光叫她做活，不管她吃饭，还成天打骂。后来她真熬不了那苦日子，偷着跑回娘家来。
    婚姻法颁布后，村上的工作同志不断地进行宣传。张月英听了，想起自己的心事，有时就流下眼泪。去年十月三日逢集，张月英赶集卖纺线，又在街上听人讲解婚姻法。她很兴奋，一面走一面想：“有婚姻法就有我的路。活着不做喻家人，死了不当喻家鬼……。”回家后，张月英就向她爹提出跟喻家断亲的事。她爹一听可气坏了，大骂她“败坏了张家的门风”。张月英拿定主意，趁她爹不在，就去南村找到了在那村工作的女干部。那个女干部告诉她：“自己的婚事要自己作主。”这下子她胆大了。第二天一早，张月英就跑到罗新楼区公所申请解除婚约，区公所批准了她的要求。她父亲知道后，便大骂不休，并把她锁在房里。第三天下午，樊家寺乡青年团支部书记王振林因事到夏金岗村来了。他知道了张月英被锁起来的情形，就去找张世道。一见面，张世道就说：“王同志，女大不由爹娘啦！她自己偷着到区里跟喻家断亲，真是不要脸。我非把她的疯气囚掉不可……”王振林细细地给他讲道理，张月英也由房里出来说：“你能看着你的亲生女儿在别人家挨打受气，当真不心疼吗？难道要看着你的亲生女儿死在眼前？你仔细想想！”王振林同志又继续说：“解放后，你翻身了，还得叫你女儿也翻身啊！”张世道最后想通了，点点头站起来说：“毛主席救了俺全家，现在我也不能看着心头肉受罪，她的事情由她办吧。”
    张月英自由了。她参加了妇女会，工作非常积极。她宣传婚姻法，格外有劲。去年腊月，张月英自由结婚了。另外四对青年男女，在张月英的影响下，也自由结婚了。大家都说：“婚姻法救了张月英，张月英又救了四双！”
