“Opened the Road to Victory”
——A Record of the Artillery in the Maliang Mountain Counterattack
By Xinhua News Agency Reporter Zhang Tao

In the Maliang Mountain blocking operation in early October, the artillery unit of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, praised as "heroic artillery," cooperated with the infantry again in early November to counterattack the enemy on Maliang Mountain. In the counterattack, they displayed even greater firepower and made meritorious contributions. The infantry unit presented them with a new red flag inscribed with "Opened the Road to Victory."

In early October, the British 29th Brigade fought for six days and nights before occupying several hilltops on Maliang Mountain. However, the British 29th Brigade was crippled as a result. The enemy then replaced the 29th Brigade with the Scottish Borderers Regiment of the British 28th Brigade to defend the Maliang Mountain positions. The enemy set up layers of barbed wire and chevaux-de-frise on the positions, built many trenches, bunkers, foxholes, and core fortifications, and laid many mines and flares. The enemy attempted to hold Maliang Mountain.

When the heroic artillerymen of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers received the order from the front-line headquarters to counterattack Maliang Mountain, they all jumped up with joy. They prepared sufficient ammunition, thickened the artillery fortifications overnight, and deepened the communication trenches. They posted slogans on the artillery positions such as "Attack Maliang Mountain, retake our positions; block and counterattack, victory after victory!" and "Kill more enemies, make international contributions; add glory to the glorious history!" The artillerymen also wrapped cookies, cigarettes, and other valuable items on the front lines in paper and sent them to the infantry tasked with the attack, with notes on the paper saying: "Cookies from the motherland, sent to the assault platoon; capture Maliang Mountain, earn a hero's badge!" They also wrote to the infantry unit tasked with the main attack, saying: "Wherever you advance, we guarantee to support you! Strive for a joint meritorious service!"

At 3:00 PM on November 4th, the artillery began to destroy the enemy's forward fortifications one by one. At 3:30 PM, at the commander's order, our artillery of various calibers roared in unison, firing hundreds of shells per minute. Our artillery shells rained down on the enemy's positions like a storm. The enemy's several artillery groups in Gowang-ri and Gojang-ri New Village were immediately suppressed by our long-range artillery fire and became mute. Smoke filled the various hilltops of Maliang Mountain, the enemy's flares were blown into the sky, illuminating the area, the explosions of mines and artillery shells sounded together, sandbags, wood, and barbed wire flew high into the sky, and even the enemy's machine guns were blown into pieces. At this time, our forward observation post sent a telephone message: "Ninety-five percent of the shells hit!" The infantry cheered and applauded, and some even started performing clapper talk on the positions: "Howitzers, fantastic, make the devils have nowhere to escape!" Then, the command post issued a signal flare for the assault. Our heroic infantry took advantage of the smoke and dust, followed the artillery shells, and climbed the various heights of Maliang Mountain in multiple directions, engaging in fierce close combat with the enemies hiding in the bunkers who dared not raise their heads. Thirteen minutes later, five signal flares indicating the occupation of the position rose on Height 216.8. After another two minutes, signal flares indicating the occupation of the position also rose on the unnamed height west of Height 280. By 7:00 PM, our army had completely retaken the various heights of Maliang Mountain, in just four hours.

In the artillery positions, although it was already early winter, the gunners were sweating all over even wearing only a shirt. Gunner and Communist Party member Zhang Liguang loaded shells into the breech, and without waiting to use the ramrod, he pushed them in with his fist. He loaded 125 shells in thirty-five minutes. Many drivers and cooks bought yellow tobacco and chestnuts with their allowances and sent them to the artillery positions to comfort the gunners. While helping to wipe the shells, they encouraged the gunners: "Give full play to our glory and maintain the glorious title of 'heroic artillery'!" When the news of the infantry's victory in storming the hilltops came, the gunners were so happy that they jumped up: "Fire quickly! Don't let the enemy run away, and don't let the enemy reinforce!" Then, our artillery shells tracked and pursued the fleeing enemy.

Not long after the battle began, more than 30 enemy planes flew in. Our anti-aircraft gunners monitored the sky, turning the steering wheel, and the rangefinder constantly reported the distance of the enemy planes. Their slogan was: "Guarantee artillery fire, infantry movement, and don't allow American planes to be fierce!" When the commander issued an order, the sky suddenly became a sea of fire. Two shells hit the enemy's lead plane. The enemy plane immediately crashed into the east bank of the Imjin River. Immediately afterwards, a second enemy plane was shot down. The other enemy planes were still not reconciled, flew in a circle, and another plane flew over, which was also shot down. At this time, the enemy planes were scattered by our anti-aircraft fire, flying high in the east and west, and did not dare to dive. They hastily dropped two napalm bombs in the high air, and the two napalm bombs fell two or three miles away from the position. The gunners were so happy that they immediately composed another clapper talk: "Anti-aircraft guns, fierce fire, anti-aircraft machine guns are also very fierce; thousands of fireballs fly into the sky, the 'superior air force' is confused; it is difficult to escape in the fire net, three enemy planes 'dive headfirst'!"

When the British prisoners were brought down from the front lines, they were very impressed by the accuracy and fierceness of our artillery fire and the bravery and decisiveness of the infantry. British prisoner John Aubuchon said: "Your shells came in groups. I squatted in the trench and didn't dare to look up or move. When your artillery fire stopped, as soon as I looked up, your soldiers were already pointing at my chest with bayonets!" Another prisoner, Roderick Mamner, said: "At that time, the trees on the mountain were broken, the single bunkers and bunkers were collapsed, and the entire position was turned upside down. A platoon plus a heavy machine gun group of 43 people on Height 216.8 were almost wiped out by your shells." He also said: "Earlier, I heard the officer say: The Chinese army has no heavy weapons, and we can hold the position with strong fortifications. Now I know this is pure nonsense."

After the battle, the artillery sent representatives with cigarettes and chestnuts to the front-line positions to comfort the heroic infantry who annihilated the enemy on Maliang Mountain. The infantry enthusiastically surrounded them and rushed to shake hands with the artillery representatives. Some soldiers, unable to leave the positions, reached out from the gun holes of the fortifications and grabbed the arms of the artillery representatives. The infantry and artillery warriors praised each other's heroic achievements on the Maliang Mountain positions.

### “打开了胜利的道路”——记马良山反击战中的炮兵

    “打开了胜利的道路”
    ——记马良山反击战中的炮兵
    新华社记者　张涛
    在十月上旬的马良山阻击战中，被称颂为“神勇的炮兵”的志愿军某部炮兵部队，在本月初又配合步兵反击马良山敌人。在反击战中，他们发挥了更强大的炮火威力，立下了战功。步兵部队又赠给他们一面新的写着“打开了胜利的道路”的红旗。
    十月上旬，英军二十九旅打了六昼夜，才占领了马良山的几座山头。但英军二十九旅因此被打成了残废。敌人便以英军二十八旅苏格兰边防团代替二十九旅据守马良山阵地。敌人在阵地上设置了层层的铁丝网、鹿砦，修了很多壕沟、地堡、散兵坑和核心工事，布设了很多地雷和照明弹。敌人妄图固守马良山。
    志愿军某部神勇的炮兵们，当接到前线指挥部反击马良山的命令后，个个都欢喜得跳起来。他们准备好充足的弹药，连夜把炮兵工事加厚，把交通沟加深。他们在炮兵阵地上贴着“攻打马良山，夺回我阵地；阻击加反击，胜利再胜利。”“多多杀敌人，立下国际功；光荣历史上，光荣加光荣！”等标语。炮兵们又用纸包好饼干、香烟等这些在前线上很贵重的物品，送给担任攻击任务的步兵，纸上面还写着：“饼干祖国来，送给突击排；攻占马良山，挂上英雄牌！”他们又写信给担任主攻任务的步兵部队说：“你们前进到那里，我们保证支援到那里！争取立个合同功！”
    十一月四日下午三点钟，炮兵开始向敌人前沿工事进行逐个摧毁射击。三点三十分，当指挥员一声令下，我各种口径大炮一齐轰鸣，每分钟发射出数百发炮弹，我们的炮弹群暴风骤雨般地倾泻到敌人阵地上。在高旺里、高栈下里新村的敌人数个炮群，顿时被我远射程炮火压制住变成了哑吧。马良山的各个山头上硝烟弥漫，敌人的照明弹被炸得飞向天空，照得一片光亮，地雷的爆炸声和炮弹爆炸声响成一片，草包、木头和铁丝网飞到半天高，连敌人的机关枪也被炸成碎片飞起来。这时，我们的前方观测所传来了电话：“炮弹百分之九十五命中！”步兵们拍手叫好，有的就在阵地上说起快板来：“榴弹炮，呱呱叫，打得鬼子没处逃！”接着，指挥所发出了冲锋讯号弹。我英勇的步兵趁着烟尘，随着炮弹，分路登上马良山各个高地，与躲藏在地堡里不敢抬头的敌人展开了激烈的近战。十三分钟后，二一六点八高地上升起了占领阵地的五颗讯号弹。又经过两分钟，二八零高地以西无名高地上也升起占领阵地的讯号弹。到下午七点钟，我军全部夺回马良山各个高地，前后只用了四小时。
    在炮兵阵地上，虽然已经是初冬的天气，炮手们穿着一件衬衣还满身大汗。炮手、共产党员张立光把炮弹装进膛去，不等用顶弹棍用拳推，三十五分钟内他装填了一百二十五发炮弹。很多驾驶员和炊事员们把自己的津贴费买了黄烟、栗子，送到炮兵阵地慰问炮手。他们一面帮助擦炮弹，一面鼓励炮手： “发挥我们的光荣，保持我们‘神勇的炮兵’的光荣称号！”当步兵胜利冲上山头的消息传来后，炮手们乐得跳起来：“快打！不叫敌人跑掉，更不叫敌人增援上来！”接着，我们的炮弹就向逃敌进行跟踪追击。
    战斗开始不久，就飞来三十多架敌机。我军高射炮手们监视着天空，转动着方向盘，测远机手不断地报告着敌机的距离。他们的口号是：“保证炮兵射击，步兵运动，不准美国飞机逞凶！”当指挥员发出一声号令，天空中顿时成了一片火海。两发炮弹正好打中敌人的领航机。这架敌机立即坠落向临津江东岸。紧接着第二架敌机又被击落了。其它的敌机还不死心，绕了一个圈子又飞过来一架，这架飞机也被击落了。这时敌机被我高射炮火打得不成队形，东一架西一架地飞得高高地不敢俯冲，在高空中慌张地投了两个汽油弹，这两个汽油弹落在离阵地二三里的地方。炮手们乐得马上又编了一首快板：“高射炮，打得猛，高射机枪也很凶；千万火球飞上天，‘优势空军’发了懵；火网里面难逃命，三架敌机‘倒栽葱’！”
    英国俘虏从火线上被带下来的时候，他们非常佩服我军炮火的准确猛烈和步兵的英勇果敢。英军俘虏约翰·奥波说：“你们的炮弹是一群一群飞来的。我蹲在壕沟里头也不敢抬，动也不敢动。当你们的炮火刚停，我一抬头，你们的战士已经端着刺刀指着我的胸口了！”另一个俘虏洛德瑞克·马姆纳尔说：“当时山上的树被打断了，单人掩体和地堡被打塌了，整个阵地都被打得像翻过来似的。二
    一六点八高地有一个排附加一个重机枪组共四十三个人，差不多都给你们的炮弹打光了。”他又说： “早先我听长官说：中国军队没有重火器，我们有坚强工事一定能守住阵地。现在我知道这纯是骗人的鬼话。”
    战斗结束后，炮兵又派代表带着香烟、栗子到前沿阵地去慰问歼灭马良山敌人的英雄步兵。步兵们都热情地围上来抢着和炮兵代表们握手。有的战士来不及走出阵地，就从工事的枪眼里伸出手来抓住炮兵代表的胳臂。步兵和炮兵勇士们在马良山阵地上互相称赞彼此的英勇战绩。
