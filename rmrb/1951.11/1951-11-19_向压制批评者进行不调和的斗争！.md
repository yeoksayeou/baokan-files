Column: Reader's Letters

　　Editor's Note: After this newspaper published the article "Song Ying, Deputy Director of the Wuhan Municipal Health Bureau, and others Should Be Disciplined for Seriously Suppressing Mass Criticism" and a brief commentary, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China ordered Song Ying and others to conduct a self-criticism; and decided to impose disciplinary actions. However, according to our understanding, Song Ying's self-criticism was extremely superficial, and is now being re-examined. Readers of this newspaper continue to send letters expressing their opinions. Excerpts from some of the readers' letters are published below.
　　The Party Organizations in Wuhan that Shielded Song Ying's Mistakes Should Conduct a Deep Self-Criticism
　　Song Ying's audacity in suppressing mass criticism stems not only from Song Ying's own arrogance and complacency, but also from the Wuhan Municipal Health Bureau's General Party Branch Committee and the Wuhan Municipal Government's Party Group's failure to implement the instructions of the higher-level Party and their shielding of Song Ying's mistakes, which also fueled Song Ying's errors. These Party organizations also need to conduct a deep self-criticism.　Zhang Caifan　Liang Yulin
　　Earnest Criticism of Party Members' Mistakes Ensures the Communist Party's Perpetual Progress
　　The People's Daily's analysis and criticism of Song Ying's mistakes has greatly educated me. This incident made me realize that individual Communist Party members with improper conduct will certainly receive due criticism and punishment. This is a weapon to ensure the Communist Party's perpetual progress. With such a political party leading it, the People's Republic of China will surely steadily advance towards prosperity and strength.

　　Some Responsible Comrades in the Wuhan Municipal Health Bureau's Party Branch, Like Song Ying, Have a Style of Suppressing Criticism
　　Our Wuhan Municipal Health Bureau Youth League branch expresses its heartfelt support for your criticism of the mistakes of Song Ying and others. Many responsible comrades in the Health Bureau, like Song Ying, exhibit a style of suppressing democracy and suppressing criticism. During the rectification movement last year, some masses submitted many written opinions to the leadership, but Zhang Jie, the Director of the Secretariat and Secretary of the General Party Branch, said, "What is this stuff!" and threw away the masses' opinion letters. On April 19th, the Dagang Newspaper forwarded a reader's opinion suggesting that the Health Bureau should remove the Kuomintang party emblem from the top of the gate. Jiang Bing, the Secretary of the Health Bureau and a member of the Party Branch Committee, simply ignored it. In addition, the Health Bureau's Party Branch does not adopt a caring and educational attitude towards the Youth League, but instead intentionally or unintentionally suppresses it. For example, Jiang Bing often says, "The Youth League is not as good as the masses." But he does not educate or help the Youth League. The bureaucratic style of Zhang Jie and Jiang Bing is the same as Song Ying's mistake, and it is by no means accidental. Usually, these leaders do not conduct criticism and self-criticism at all, so this bad style is developing day by day. Zhang Jie and Jiang Bing must also conduct a deep self-criticism.

　　Some Cadres in Wuhan Still Hold a Liberal Attitude Towards the Error of Suppressing Criticism
　　Since the People's Daily criticized Song Ying and others' bad style of suppressing mass criticism, under the correct leadership of the Party organizations in Central and South China and with the active support of most comrades, criticism and self-criticism within the Wuhan Party has gradually unfolded. However, some comrades still stand outside the circle of criticism, and even some more responsible cadres are still shouting, "The criticism is excessive!" or saying, "In the past, when Party members made mistakes, they were criticized and dealt with within the Party. Now it's different. This is a 'new shift'." These fully illustrate their insufficient understanding of criticism and self-criticism. There are also some people who, after seeing the criticism in the newspaper, adopt a liberal attitude of "not seeking merit, but seeking no fault," which is also wrong. These thoughts are all hindering the development of criticism and self-criticism. Therefore, it is necessary for us to restudy the CCP Central Committee's decision on launching criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals, and the writings of Comrades Stalin and Mao Zedong on criticism and self-criticism, to carefully understand them, correct our attitude; those who have errors similar to Song Ying and others should boldly face up to their errors and criticize them.　Wang Shixun

### 向压制批评者进行不调和的斗争！

　　向压制批评者进行不调和的斗争！
    编者按：自本报发表“武汉市卫生局副局长
    宋瑛等严重压制群众批评应受处分”的文章和
    简评后，中共武汉市委已令宋瑛等进行检讨；
    并决定给予处分。但据我们了解，宋瑛的检讨
    极不深刻，现正重新进行检讨。本报读者现仍
    不断来信表示意见，现将一部分读者来信摘要
    发表如下。
    武汉市包庇宋瑛错误的党组织应作深刻检讨
    宋瑛敢于压制群众的批评，除了宋瑛本人存在着骄傲居功的思想外，武汉市卫生局中共总支委员会、武汉市政府党组不执行上级党的指示，包庇宋瑛的错误，也助长了宋瑛的错误，这些党组织同样需要作深刻的检讨。　张采凡　梁玉麟
    对党员错误的严正批评，保证了共产党永远前进
    人民日报对宋瑛错误的分析、批评，大大教育了我。这件事使我知道，个别作风不正派的共产党员，一定会受到应得的批评和处分。这是保证共产党永远前进的武器。中华人民共和国有了这样的政党来领导，一定能稳步地走上繁荣、富强的坦途。
                                    王秉贤
　　 武汉市卫生局党支部某些负责同志和宋瑛一样有压制批评的作风
    我们青年团武汉市卫生局支部表示衷心拥护你们对宋瑛等的错误的批判。卫生局许多负责同志与宋瑛一样地存在着压制民主、压制批评的作风。去年整风运动中，有些群众对领导上提了很多书面意见，秘书主任、中共总支书记张洁就说：“这是什么东西！”就把群众的意见书扔了。四月十九日大刚报转来一读者意见，建议卫生局应把门顶上的国民党党徽凿掉。卫生局秘书、中共支部委员姜冰竟置之不理。另外卫生局党支部对青年团也不是采取爱护教育的态度，而是有意无意地给予打击。如姜冰常说“青年团不如群众”。但又不对青年团进行教育、帮助。张洁、姜冰的官僚主义作风和宋瑛的错误一样，绝不是偶然的，平时他们几个领导人，根本不进行批评与自我批评，因此这种恶劣的作风一天天在发展。张洁、姜冰亦必须深刻检讨。

　　 武汉市有些干部仍对压制批评的错误抱自由主义态度
    自从人民日报批判宋瑛等压制群众批评的恶劣作风后，在中南的党组织的正确领导和大多数同志积极支持下，武汉市党内的批评与自我批评逐渐展开。但也有些同志，仍站在批评圈之外，甚至有些较负责的干部还在那里叫喊：“批评过火了！”或者说：“过去党员犯了错误，都是在党内批评和处理，现在不同了，这是‘新转变’。”这些充分说明了他们对于批评与自我批评还认识不足。也还有些人在看到报上的批评后，抱着“不求有功，但求无过”的自由主义态度，这也是错误的。这些思想都是阻挠批评与自我批评的开展的。因此我们有必要再好好学习中共中央关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定和斯大林、毛泽东同志关于批评与自我批评的论著，好好体会，端正自己的态度；有类似宋瑛等错误的人，应大胆地正视错误，批判错误。　王世勋
