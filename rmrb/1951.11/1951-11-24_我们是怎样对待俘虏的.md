How We Treat Prisoners of War
By Wang Yanlin, a Soldier of a Certain Unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

I am a soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. After seeing the news published in the People's Daily on November 17th regarding the American aggressors' fabricated and shameless lie about the so-called "killing of prisoners of war" by the Korean and Chinese People's forces, I was extremely angry. The enemy's unfounded lie further reveals its despicable shamelessness. Now I want to tell the people of the world about how we personally treat the prisoners of war of the invading army on the battlefield, in order to more thoroughly smash the enemy's shameless lies.

"Lenient treatment of prisoners of war" is one of the disciplines of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and this humanitarian discipline is also observed in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. This correct policy towards prisoners of war has become a fine tradition of the Chinese People's Army. We treat the prisoners of war of the American invading army and other vassal countries' armies, as well as the Li Chengwan puppet army, in the same way as the People's Liberation Army treated the Kuomintang bandit army prisoners leniently during the domestic Liberation War. Although the current prisoners of war are foreign invading troops of a different race from us, because they have laid down their weapons, we still treat them leniently with a humanitarian spirit. Although material conditions are extremely difficult on the Korean battlefield, in terms of our protection and care for prisoners of war, it is in some respects even better than the People's Liberation Army's treatment of Kuomintang bandit prisoners during the domestic Liberation War. In order to earnestly implement this discipline, we regard the quality of the execution of the prisoner of war policy as an important part of the review at each post-battle commendation meeting or review meeting. In our unit, it is as important as battlefield discipline and mass discipline.

We are a just army composed of the Chinese people. We treat enemies holding weapons with relentless annihilation; but once the enemy lays down their weapons, we treat them leniently in a humanitarian spirit. The following are some examples of how we leniently treat prisoners of war:

During the battle to capture Huayao Mountain in the Third Campaign, we disrupted the enemy, and a regiment of the Li puppet army, apart from those who were annihilated and captured, fled and hid in the nearby deep mountains, freezing and starving in the several feet of snow, afraid to come down. Due to the influence of our lenient prisoner of war policy, many prisoners of war were moved. They voluntarily asked to go to the mountains to call down those Li puppet army stragglers. Some even came down on their own to beg for food. Although food was scarce at that time, we took out all our dry rations and distributed them to the prisoners of war. Later, we received some rice grains, and we pounded rice every day to make meals for them. Some of the prisoners of war were wounded or had their feet frostbitten in the mountains. In the absence of medicine, we still treated the frostbite and wounded prisoners of war, and also dug many air-raid shelters for them to prevent American planes from killing them. Our lenient policy towards prisoners of war moved many prisoners of war. They said to our liaison officers: "You are truly a humanitarian army. The way you treat us is like heaven compared to the way our officers treat us!"

During the counterattack in the Fourth Campaign, I was assigned the task of guarding prisoners of war. When I was talking to several American prisoners of war, I took out two packs of cigarettes that were issued to me by my superiors and had just been sent from the motherland. I gave them two cigarettes. Other prisoners of war snatched the cigarette butts from the prisoners who had cigarettes, snatching while looking at me with pleading eyes, wanting but not daring to ask. Although I hadn't smoked cigarettes from the motherland for several months, I still took them all out, and they were immediately smoked clean. Later, when we were transferring them from the battlefield to the rear, they were happy to see that we were going north. Some gave us a thumbs-up, and some held our hands tightly and shed tears of gratitude. On the road, enemy artillery shells constantly hit and exploded near us. The prisoners of war were very scared and walked very fast. A few of the prisoners of war were wounded or had frostbitten feet and could not walk, often falling behind. We told all the prisoners of war to wait for them to walk together. The prisoners of war hoped to leave this dangerous area of frequent shelling as soon as possible, so they were very dissatisfied with the prisoners who could not walk. Some prisoners of war even asked us to abandon the prisoners who could not walk, but we refused. We told them that the artillery shells were not terrible, and we told them, "If we abandon them, they will freeze and starve to death even if they are not killed by artillery shells." We indicated that even if more artillery shells fell, we would send the prisoners who could not walk to the rear. Later, some wounded prisoners of war could not move after walking a short distance and crawled on the ground. Other prisoners of war became anxious and cursed them, and even kicked them barbarously, which was immediately stopped and reprimanded by us. We told them, "We do not allow hitting or cursing people here." We ordered the other prisoners of war to carry one of the prisoners who could not walk on their backs. Finally, there were four or five who could not walk. We immediately decided that each of our comrades escorting the prisoners of war would carry one on their back. When I went to carry a prisoner who could not walk on my back, he looked at me with very grateful eyes, nodded repeatedly, and even cried. Although we were very tired due to continuous marching and combat, we knew that what we were doing was right, so we carried them for more than thirty miles, regardless of how tall or heavy they were. This greatly moved the other prisoners of war, so they patiently carried the wounded prisoners of war. After we sent this group of prisoners of war to the rear and the hospital, we left two prisoners of war behind, preparing to ask them to help us repair a captured car. Because there were fewer prisoners of war, we didn't pay much attention, but the two of them always followed us closely, never leaving. When crossing a river, there were too many vehicles coming and going. When we crossed, we couldn't find the two prisoners of war. That night we stayed in a village, and we were all worried about losing the prisoners of war. At dawn, the door was suddenly pushed open, and the two prisoners of war poked their heads in. When they saw us, they ran over and shook hands. After the interpreter asked them, they found out that they had been looking for us for half the night. They said, "You treat us very well, we were scared when we couldn't find you!" We told them, "The Volunteer Army treats prisoners of war leniently, and so does every unit."

This is how we treat prisoners of war of the invading army. The enemy's unfounded, despicable and shameless lies cannot be refuted by these living facts. The enemy's malicious rumors cannot cover up the discerning eyes of the people of the world. In fact, it is these rumor-mongering beasts themselves who truly mistreat and slaughter prisoners of war.

### 我们是怎样对待俘虏的

　　我们是怎样对待俘虏的
    中国人民志愿军某部  王砚麟
    我是志愿军的一个战士，当我看到十一月十七日人民日报登载的关于美国侵略者捏造的所谓朝中人民部队“杀害俘虏”的无耻谎言的消息后，我非常气愤。敌人的这个毫无事实根据的谎言，更加显露了它的卑鄙无耻。现在我要把我们在战场上亲自对待侵略军俘虏的情形，告诉给全世界人民，以便更加彻底地粉碎敌人的无耻谎言。
    “宽待俘虏”是中国人民解放军的纪律之一，这种人道主义的纪律，在中国人民志愿军中也被同样地遵守着。这种正确的俘虏政策已经成为中国人民军队的一个优良传统。我们对待美国侵略军和其他附庸国军队以及李承晚伪军的战俘，是与人民解放军在国内解放战争中宽待蒋介石匪军俘虏是完全一样的，尽管现在的俘虏是和我们不同种族的外国侵略军，因为他们已经放下武器，我们还是以人道主义的精神去宽待他们；在朝鲜战场上虽然物质条件异常困难，但是从我们对俘虏的保护和照顾上来说，有的地方还要高过人民解放军在国内解放战争中对蒋匪俘虏的待遇。我们为了认真执行这条纪律，在每次战役结束后的评功会或检讨会上，都要把执行俘虏政策的好坏，作为一条重要的内容来检讨。在我们部队中它是和战场纪律、群众纪律同样重要的。
    我们是由中国人民所组成的正义军队，我们对待拿着武器的敌人，是毫不留情地加以消灭；但是一旦敌人放下了武器，我们就以人道主义的精神去宽待他们。下面就是我们怎样宽待俘虏的几个事例：
    在第三次战役攻取华耀山的战斗中，我们把敌人打乱了，李伪军的一个联队除了就歼和被俘的以外，一部分逃散到附近的深山里隐藏起来，在几尺深的雪里冻着饿着，不敢下来。由于我们宽待俘虏政策的影响，使许多俘虏感动了，他们自动地要求要到山上去把那些李伪军的散兵喊下来，也有的是自己跑下来要饭吃的，虽然那时粮食困难，但是我们却把干粮全部拿出来分给俘虏吃了。后来我们又领到一部分稻粒，我们就每天捣米给他们做饭。部分俘虏是负伤的或在山上把脚冻伤了，在医药缺乏的情况下，我们还医治了冻伤和负伤的战俘，并且还给他们挖了不少的防空洞，以免美国飞机来杀害他们。我们宽待俘虏的政策感动了许多俘虏，他们对我们的联络员说：“你们真是讲人道主义的军队，你们对待我们的情形，和我们的军官对待我们的情形比起来，真是一天一地！”
    在第四次战役的反击战中，我担任看管俘虏的任务。我在和几个美军俘虏谈话的时候，拿出了上级发给我的、才从祖国送来的两盒纸烟，我把纸烟给了他们两支，其他的俘虏就向吸到纸烟的俘虏抢烟屁股，一面抢，一面用乞求的眼光望着我，想要而又不敢要；虽然我也是几个月没抽到祖国的纸烟了，可是我还是全部拿出来，这样，一下子就叫他们抽光了。后来我们从战场上把他们往后方转送，他们一见是往北走，都高兴起来，有的向我们伸大拇指，有的紧握着我们的手感激得流泪。在路上，敌军的炮弹不时地打过来，在我们的附近爆炸，俘虏们非常害怕，走的很快。俘虏里面有少数负伤的和冻坏脚的，走不动，时常掉在后面，我们就叫全体俘虏等着他们一起走。俘虏们都希望很快地离开这一段常落炮弹的危险地带，因此对走不动的俘虏就非常不满，有的俘虏竟要求我们把不能走的俘虏丢掉不管，被我们拒绝了，我们一面告诉他们炮弹并不可怕，一面对他们说：“如果把他们丢掉，他们不被炮弹打死也要冻死和饿死的。”我们表示就是炮弹落得再多，我们也要把走不动的俘虏一起送到后方。后来有些负伤的俘虏走了不远又爬在地下不能动了，其他的俘虏着急了就咒骂他们，并且用脚野蛮地踢他们，当即受到我们的阻止和斥责。我们告诉他们：“在我们这里不允许打人骂人。”我们就命令其他的俘虏，两个人背一个走不动的，最后还有四、五个不能走的，我们马上就决定由我们押送俘虏的同志每人背一个。当我去背起一个走不动的俘虏时，他用十分感激的眼光望着我，连连点头，而且呜呜的哭起来了。虽然我们由于连续行军作战而非常疲乏，但是我们知道这样做是对的，也就不管他们个子再大，身体再重，一直背了三十多里路。这使其他俘虏也大为感动，因而他们也就很耐心地背着负伤的俘虏。我们把这批俘虏送到后方和医院里去以后，又留下两个俘虏，准备叫他帮我们修一辆缴获的汽车。因为俘虏少了，我们也就不大注意，可是他们两人总是紧紧地跟在我们后面，一步也不离。在过一条江时，来往的车辆太多，当我们走过去时却找不见那两个俘虏了，当晚我们住在一个村子里，我们都为丢掉俘虏而担心。天亮后，忽然屋门被推开了，两个俘虏探头进来，看见我们就跑过来握手。经翻译员问他们，才知道他们找了我们半夜，他们说：“你们待我们很好，找不见你们可把我们吓坏啦！”我们告诉他们：“志愿军是宽待俘虏的，那个部队也一样。”
    我们对待侵略军的战俘就是这样。敌人无中生有、卑鄙无耻的谎言，是辩不过这些活生生的事实的。敌人这种恶毒的谣言，是丝毫不能掩盖住世界人民雪亮的眼睛的。事实上真正虐待战俘、屠杀俘虏的倒是这群造谣的野兽们自己。
