Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 16th: The fifth session of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) Council opened on the 15th at the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic in Berlin. More than 300 delegates representing over 80 million trade union members from 64 countries attended the meeting. The main agenda of the session included: the report on the work of the WFTU by Secretary-General Saillant, and the report by WFTU Executive Committee member Frachon on "The solidarity of working people in the struggle to improve living conditions and oppose the economic and social consequences of the arms race policy."

The WFTU President Vittorio delivered the opening speech, pointing out the importance of the WFTU Council meeting: Despite all the tricks used by the splitters in the trade union movement, more countries sent representatives to this meeting than before. Japan, Egypt, Sudan, and British Guiana all had representatives attending the meeting for the first time, and there were many representatives from trade unions in Black Africa. Representatives from twelve Latin American countries also participated in the work of the meeting. Vittorio pointed out that capitalist countries are expanding their military budgets and preparing for war, which is worsening the living conditions of the working class. Therefore, the main task of trade unions is to unite all working people to fight for improved living and working conditions, for reduced military spending, and for freedom and world peace. The WFTU is striving to strengthen the unity of working people in all countries to carry out the struggle to safeguard and ensure peace.

The Chairman of the Free German Trade Union Federation, Warnke, the Minister of Labor of the German Democratic Republic, Schwark, and representatives of working people from the German Democratic Republic and West Germany delivered welcome speeches successively. Warnke said: This meeting and the resolutions it passes will be a great support to the German working people in their struggle for national unification, against re-militarization, and for the defense of world peace.

At the afternoon session, WFTU Secretary-General Saillant delivered a report on the work of the WFTU. Saillant said: In the twenty-eight months since the fourth session of the Council, the WFTU has completed a great deal of work and consolidated its influence. It has consistently provided assistance and support to the working masses.

In his report, Saillant elaborated on the international situation, pointing out that the governments of capitalist countries are trampling on the Yalta and Potsdam Agreements, undermining the UN Charter, preparing for new wars, and have already carried out open military aggression. West Germany and Japan are being re-militarized, and in those countries controlled by the United States, the democratic rights of working people are being widely attacked. However, the working people have an unshakable will and are determined to fight for peace, democracy, and national independence, and against the war plots of the imperialists. The situations in Iran, Egypt, and other countries specifically prove this point. Saillant emphasized that in the past twenty-eight months, there have been several large-scale strikes in capitalist countries, and the struggle to defend peace has also been strengthened. The WFTU has always given the greatest support to the struggles of the working class, promoted their concerted action, and resolutely fought against the splitters who undermine trade union unity.

Saillant then condemned the American aggression against Korea under the guise of the United Nations flag. At Saillant's proposal, all the delegates stood up to observe a moment of silence for Choi Kyung-deok and Seo Chang-seop, leaders of the Korean trade unions and members of the WFTU Council, who sacrificed themselves in the Korean War of Liberation.

When talking about the tasks of the trade unions, Saillant called on the trade unions to strengthen their ties with the masses. Saillant concluded by saying: Since the WFTU has proven that it is a vivid manifestation of proletarian internationalism, the international working class can also prove with its struggle that proletarian internationalism is the only path that guides people towards the happiness of all mankind and towards lasting and consolidated peace.

    世界工联理事会第五次会议开幕
    赛扬总书记斥责美国侵略朝鲜的罪行
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：世界工会联合会理事会第五次会议于十五日在柏林德意志民主共和国人民议会大厦开幕。参加会议的有代表六十四个国家八千余万工会会员的三百多位代表。这次会议的主要议程是：世界工联总书记赛扬关于世界工联工作的报告，世界工联执行委员会委员佛拉商关于“劳动人民在争取改善生活条件、反对备战政策的经济和社会后果的斗争中的团结”的报告。
    世界工联主席维多里奥致开幕词，指出世界工联理事会会议的重要性说：尽管工会运动中的分裂分子用尽一切诡计，但是，派代表参加这次会议的国家，还是比以前增加了。日本、埃及、苏丹和英属几内亚都第一次有代表参加会议，黑非洲的工会有不少的代表参加会议。十二个拉丁美洲国家的代表也参加了会议的工作。维多里奥指出：资本主义国家正在扩大军事预算，准备战争，这使得工人阶级的生活状况恶化了。因此，工会的主要工作，就是团结全体劳动人民，为改善生活和工作条件，为削减军事费用，为自由和世界和平而奋斗。世界工联正努力加强各国劳动人民的团结，来进行维护和确保和平的斗争。
    自由德国工会联合会主席瓦恩克、德意志民主共和国劳动部长施瓦里克、德意志民主共和国和西德的劳动人民代表团人员相继致欢迎词。瓦恩克说：这次会议和它所通过的决议，对于为争取国家统一、反对重新军国主义化和维护世界和平而斗争的德国劳动人民，将是极大的支持。
    下午会议上，世界工联总书记赛扬作了关于世界工联工作的报告。赛扬说：在理事会第四次会议以来的二十八个月中，世界工联完成了许多工作，巩固了它的影响。它经常给劳动群众以援助和支持。
    赛扬在报告中详尽地论述了国际形势，他指出：资本主义国家的政府践踏雅尔塔和波茨坦协定，破坏联合国宪章，正在准备新的战争，并且已进行了公开的军事侵略。西德和日本正在被重新军国主义化，在那些受美国控制的国家里，劳动人民的民主权利遭到广泛的进攻。但是，劳动人民有着不可动摇的意志，决心为和平、民主和民族独立而斗争，反对帝国主义者的战争阴谋。伊朗、埃及和其他国家的局势就具体地证明了这一点。赛扬强调说：二十八个月来，资本主义国家内曾经发生过好几次大规模的罢工，保卫和平的斗争也加强了。世界工联始终对工人阶级的斗争给予最大的支持，促进了他们的行动一致，并对破坏工会团结的分裂分子进行了坚决的斗争。
    赛扬接着斥责了美国在联合国旗帜的掩护下侵略朝鲜的行为。在赛扬的提议之下，全体与会代表起立为在朝鲜解放战争中牺牲的朝鲜工会领袖、世界工联理事会理事崔璟德和徐昌燮默哀。
    赛扬在谈到工会的任务时，号召工会加强与群众的联系。赛扬最后说：既然世界工联已经证明了它是无产阶级国际主义生动的表现，那末国际工人阶级也就能够以它的斗争来证明，无产阶级国际主义是引导人民走向全人类的幸福、走向巩固的持久和平的唯一道路。
