Editor's Note: This article systematically introduces the experiences of state-owned factories in Shenyang in carrying out the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign. The experiences put forward in the article, such as strengthening political work in enterprises, combining labor and technology, combining technical personnel and workers, implementing a reward system that combines national interests and workers' interests, and leaders going deep into workshops, are of important reference value to enterprises across the country.

(I)

State-owned and public-owned factories in Shenyang launched an increase production and practice economy campaign in August. By the end of September, the factories in the city had increased production and practiced economy, creating wealth equivalent to 1.6 million tons of grain for the country, which is equal to 80% of the total task (2 million tons) assigned by the economic authorities. Among them, 14 state-owned factories have completed and exceeded the annual task assigned by their respective authorities by an average of 20%. In order to implement Chairman Mao's great call to the people of the whole country at the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: increase production, practice economy, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers, Comrade Kai Feng, Secretary of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, put forward at the city-wide cadres' meeting on November 5th the goal of striving to complete the wealth of 2.5 million tons of grain.

During the patriotic increase production and practice economy emulation drive, the morale of the workers and staff of state-owned and public-owned factories in Shenyang was exceptionally high. The 12th workshop of a certain factory implemented the method of "red flag inspection, blue flag supervision": those who complete the planned progress are marked with a red flag, and those who fail to complete the progress are marked with a blue flag. At the beginning, some workers and a few groups had blue flags; soon, the workers proposed the slogan of striving for "full house red", so that the entire section was filled with red flags, and after each section completed the progress, the 12th workshop also achieved "full house red". Then, all the staff and technicians of the factory also joined the emulation drive. Metallurgical plants, a certain factory, and pharmaceutical factories also launched city-wide emulation drives. Auxiliary departments and odd-job personnel, who used to stay outside the movement, also participated in the competition. One of the characteristics of this patriotic increase production and practice economy campaign is the launch of a "find shortcuts" campaign to improve technology, improve labor organization, and transform tools. Incomplete statistics from the five factories under the Machinery Bureau alone show that the masses proposed and implemented 235 "shortcuts". These shortcuts played a great role in improving production. Workers at the directly subordinate workshop of the No. 6 Paper Mill installed an extra paper roll on the paper machine, which increased the output by five meters of paper per hour; the production efficiency of the No. 3 paper machine was increased from an average of 50 meters per second to 55 meters per second by replacing a transmission wheel. Workers at Machine Factory No. 1 divided the parts of the product into four categories: main, standard, precision, and general. According to the process requirements of each type of part, they organized joint groups of mixed machine tools, replacing the unreasonable production organization of compiling shifts and groups purely according to machine types in the past, which increased production efficiency by nearly one time.

The above achievements are inseparable from the improvement of the political consciousness of the workers and staff. The administration, the Party, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League of each factory carried out a universal and in-depth education for the vast number of workers and staff on the political and economic significance of the increase production and practice economy campaign, so that the vast number of workers and staff recognized the great significance of the development of industry for consolidating national defense, recognized the great strength of the working class, and greatly improved the sense of responsibility of all workers and staff as masters of their own affairs, and encouraged their enthusiasm and initiative in production. When a factory was formulating operating procedures, almost all the old workers demonstrated their "shortcuts". In the past, this was very difficult to achieve. Staff and technicians have also made great progress in the movement. Their sense of responsibility as masters of their own affairs has been strengthened. It has become a more common phenomenon for technicians to cooperate with workers to find shortcuts, inspectors to go to the workshops, and staff to help workers formulate increase production and practice economy plans.

It should be pointed out that the increase production and practice economy campaign in the state-owned and public-owned factories in Shenyang is still very uneven. Local industries (including enterprises run by agencies and troops) are far behind the state-owned industries; the masses in these factories have not yet been fully mobilized, and relevant departments are helping them. The more advanced state-owned factories have completed or are close to completing their plans and are further mobilizing the masses, revising their plans, and strengthening workshop work to deepen and regularize the movement; those who have not completed their plans are deeply mobilizing the masses to carry out the "find shortcuts" campaign, striving to overfulfill the increase production and practice economy plan.

(II)

The increase production and practice economy campaign in the state-owned and public-owned factories in Shenyang is generally carried out in three stages: Studying documents and clarifying the policy; Exploring potential and formulating plans; Finding shortcuts and launching competitions.

When the city first launched the increase production and practice economy campaign, many factory cadres did not have a sufficient understanding of the great significance of increasing production and practicing economy; their simple financial task viewpoint was quite serious. In addition, the task numbers initially assigned by higher authorities were relatively low, and it was relatively easy to complete such tasks, so they did not pay much attention to mobilizing the masses to tap potential. Some factory leaders once opposed the ongoing quality inspection and the increase production and practice economy campaign; they did not consider the quality inspection to be an important part of the increase production and practice economy campaign, but thought that these tasks could only be done one by one, without studying how to closely integrate them, thus affecting the rapid development of the increase production and practice economy campaign. After discovering the above two kinds of thinking, the higher-level leading organs immediately criticized them continuously through newspapers, and continuously introduced typical experiences of relying on the masses to give play to potential. Many factories that had taken detours or could not launch the movement re-organized cadres to study the documents of the Urban Work Conference of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and unified the thinking of the cadres. Then, a universal and in-depth education on the significance and policy of increasing production and practicing economy was carried out among all workers and staff, and plans were made in conjunction with this education to mobilize the masses and tap potential. The experience of the movement proves that formulating specific and practical increase production and practice economy plans from the factory to the team, turning potential capabilities into planned tasks, and turning political calls into mass actions is the first key to ensuring the completion of the increase production and practice economy task. The process of formulating the team's increase production and practice economy plan is a process of educating and mobilizing the masses, tapping potential, and improving operation and management. Because without deeply educating the masses, without raising the masses' patriotic ideology, and without criticizing the individualism and conservative ideology in production among the masses, it is impossible to rely on the masses to explore potential, and it is impossible to formulate advanced plans. Facts have proved that the plans made by the leading organs are often conservative. In actual implementation, the plans stipulated by the higher authorities are often exceeded at each level. To make the plan well, it is also necessary to mobilize the staff and technicians to help the workshop and the team specifically, and solve the relevant technical problems and the calculation of costs, unit prices, etc. In this way, the process of formulating the plan must be a process of improving operation and management. Generally speaking, anyone who has formulated a specific team plan has also laid the foundation for completing the plan. After the team plan is formulated, the patriotic pact should be revised, and the completion of the increase production and practice economy plan should be regarded as the main content of the patriotic pact. After formulating the team plan and revising the patriotic pact, a contact contract should be further formulated; after a certain period of preparation, a collective contract should be signed. This plays a great role in ensuring the increase production and practice economy campaign. After the plan is formulated, the masses should be mobilized to find shortcuts and launch competitions, which is the main method to ensure the realization of the plan. After "finding shortcuts" becomes a mass movement, it can improve labor productivity and avoid the shortcomings of pure physical competition, which cannot be consolidated and lasting. The reason why a mass movement of finding shortcuts can be launched in this competition is inseparable from the importance attached to technical learning and promotion of the Kovalev work method in quality inspection, and it is inseparable from the strengthening of cooperation between technicians and workers in quality inspection. This is a great harvest.

(III)

The reason why the increase production and practice economy campaign can achieve the above achievements is that the leadership organs at all levels have firmly grasped the following policies:

First, strengthen political work in enterprises. State-owned and public-owned factories conscientiously implemented the spirit of the Urban Work Conference of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and greatly strengthened political work in enterprises. The administrative cadres in enterprises no longer ignore political work, but regard political work as the key to running people's enterprises well. Many factory directors and workshop directors personally participated in or directly grasped the political work of mobilizing the masses. The Party and mass work cadres, because they further clarified the policy that political work must be combined with economic work, gradually paid attention to learning and studying production knowledge, grasping the key problems in production, and exploring and summarizing the experience of the Party in ensuring and supervising production in enterprises, thus improving the role of political work in ensuring and supervising production. After they initially learned production knowledge, the propaganda and mobilization work they carried out was no longer empty preaching, but lively and persuasive slogans. These propaganda and mobilization work is closely linked to the current political task of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and the future communist prospects.

Second, implement the policy of combining labor and technology, and combining technical personnel and workers. In order to solve the main problems in product quality, factories and mines widely carried out the rationalization proposal movement and established and improved the technical management system. The "find shortcuts" movement since the increase production and practice economy campaign has further implemented the policy of combining labor and technology. One of the important signs of the combination of labor and technology is the combination of technical personnel and workers. Since the increase production and practice economy campaign, the ideological transformation of technical personnel has made great progress. Many factories organized political study for technical personnel and launched internal criticism and self-criticism among technical personnel. Through internal discussions in factories, discussions in newspapers, typical reports at technical personnel meetings, etc., the guest-like thinking and hired attitude, the thinking of despising labor and despising workers, and the style of divorcing theory from practice among technical personnel were effectively educated and criticized. Especially since the promotion of the Kovalev work method, technical personnel have received practical education from the practical operating experience of workers, which has further promoted the combination of technical personnel and workers. The patriotic increase production and practice economy emulation drive has completely changed the phenomenon of physical competition in the past few emulation drives, which is closely related to the implementation of this correct policy.

Third, implement the policy of combining national interests and workers' interests, and implement the reward system. Factories are gradually promoting piece-rate wages and stipulating labor quotas. Collective contracts are the main organizational form for implementing this policy.

Fourth, leading cadres going deep into the workshop and strengthening workshop work is an important guarantee for implementing various policies. In the movement, leading cadres of many factories went deep into the workshops (especially important workshops), grasped the key problems in production, studied reasonable ways to organize production, strengthened the technical management of the workshops, and then improved the operation and management of the enterprises. The Party and mass work cadres went deep into the workshops to grasp the ideological trends of the masses, strengthened political education in a timely manner, and relied on the activities of the Party branch and the exemplary leading role of Party members and Communist Youth League members to unite technical personnel and veteran technical workers, and continuously solved the key problems in production, in order to ensure the implementation of the plan. The various work of the factory headquarters gradually became better at serving the workshop.

　　沈阳市国营工厂增产节约运动经验值得推广
    本报特约记者　薛光军
    编者按：这篇文章，比较系统地介绍了沈阳市国营工厂开展增产节约运动的经验。文中提出的加强企业中的政治工作、实行劳动与技术相结合、技术人员与工人相结合、实行国家利益与工人利益相结合的奖励制度、领导干部深入车间等经验，对于全国企业都有着重要的参考价值。
    （一）
    沈阳市各国营公营工厂，于八月份先后展开了增产节约运动。到九月底止，该市各厂已经给国家增产节约了价值一百六十万吨粮食的财富，等于各主管经济机关所分配的全部任务（二百万吨）的百分之八十。其中有十四个国营工厂，已平均完成和超过了各主管机关所分配的全年任务的百分之二十。为了贯彻执行毛主席在人民政协会议全国委员会上向全国人民提出的：增加生产，厉行节约，以支持人民志愿军的伟大号召。中共沈阳市委书记凯丰同志在十一月五日的全市干部大会上，又提出争取完成价值二百五十万吨粮食财富的奋斗目标。
    在爱国增产节约竞赛运动中，沈阳市各国营公营工厂职工的情绪异常高涨。某工厂十二车间实行了 “红旗检查，蓝旗督促”的方法：规定完成计划进度者插红旗，完不成进度者插蓝旗。开始曾有部分工人和少数小组插蓝旗；不久，工人提出争取“满堂红”的口号，使整个工段都插满红旗，在每个工段都完成进度后，十二车间也作到“满堂红”了。接着全厂职员和技术人员，也都卷入了竞赛运动。冶炼厂、某工厂、制药厂，也展开了全厂规模的竞赛，过去经常留在运动外面的辅助部门和勤杂人员，都参加了竞赛。这次爱国增产节约运动的特点之一，是展开了改进技术、改善劳动组织、改造工具的“找窍门”运动。只机械局所属五个工厂的不完全统计，群众提出并实现了的“窍门”，即达二百三十五件。这些窍门对提高生产起了很大作用。造纸六厂直属车间工友在抄纸机上多装了一个卷纸滚，一小时能多出五米纸；三号抄纸机换了一个变速轮，生产效率平均由每秒五十米提高到五十五米。机器一厂工人把产品的部件分成主要、标准、精密与一般四类，按每类部件工序要求，组织了各种机床混合编组的联合小组，代替过去单纯按照机器种类编制班组的不合理的生产组织，使生产效率提高将近一倍。
    上述成绩的取得，是与职工政治觉悟的提高分不开的。各厂行政、党、工会、青年团对于广大职工，进行了关于增产节约运动的政治意义和经济意义的普遍深入的教育，使广大职工认识了发展工业对于巩固国防的重大意义，认识了工人阶级的伟大力量，大大提高了全体职工的主人翁的责任感，鼓舞了他们的生产热情和积极性。某工厂在制订操作规程时，几乎所有老工友都表演了自己的“窍门”。在过去，这是很难作到的。职员和技术人员，在运动中也有了很大进步。他们的主人翁的责任感加强了。技术人员与工人合作找窍门，检验人员下车间，职员帮助工人订增产节约计划，已是较为普遍的现象了。
    应该指出，沈阳市各国营公营工厂的增产节约运动仍是很不平衡的。地方工业（包括机关、部队经营的企业）远远落在国营工业的后面；这些工厂的群众至今仍未充分发动起来，有关部门正在加以帮助。国营工厂中比较先进的，已经完成或接近完成计划，正在进一步发动群众，增订计划，加强车间工作，使运动走向深入和经常；没有完成计划的，正在深入发动群众，开展“找窍门”运动，争取超额完成增产节约计划。
    （二）
    沈阳市各国营公营工厂中的增产节约运动，一般是经过三个阶段开展起来的。即：学习文件，明确方针；挖掘潜力，订出计划；寻找窍门，开展竞赛。
    该市最初发动增产节约运动的时候，许多工厂的干部，对增产节约的重大意义认识不足；他们的单纯财政任务观点是相当严重的。加以上级机关最初分配的任务数字比较低，完成这种任务比较容易，所以他们就不大注意发动群众挖掘潜力了。有些工厂的领导干部曾经把正在进行的质量大检查和增产节约运动对立起来；他们不认为质量大检查是增产节约运动的重要组成部分，而认为这些工作，只能一件一件的作，不研究如何使之密切结合，因而影响了增产节约运动的迅速开展。上级领导机关发现上述两种思想后，立即通过报纸，连续地进行批评，并不断介绍依靠群众发挥潜力的典型经验。许多走了弯路或运动开展不起来的工厂，重新组织干部学习中共中央东北局城市工作会议的文件，统一了干部思想。接着在全体职工中普遍深入地进行关于增产节约的意义与方针的教育，并结合这种教育订出计划，发动群众，挖掘潜力。运动的经验证明：订出具体的切合实际的从工厂到小组的增产节约计划，把潜在能力变为计划任务，把政治号召变为群众行动，这是保证完成增产节约任务的第一个关键。订立小组增产节约计划的过程，是一个教育与发动群众挖掘潜在力和改善经营管理的过程。因为不深入教育群众，不提高群众的爱国主义思想，不批评群众中的个人主义与生产中的保守思想，就不可能依靠群众发掘潜力，也就不可能订出先进计划。事实证明，领导机关作的计划往往是保守的。在实际执行中，上级规定的计划往往是逐级超过的。要把计划订好，还必须把职员和技术人员动员起来，使他们具体帮助车间和小组，解决有关技术问题和成本、单价等的计算问题。这样，订立计划的过程，必然是改善经营管理的过程。凡是订立了具体的小组计划的，一般说也就奠定了完成计划的基础。小组计划订立后，要根据计划，修订爱国公约，将完成增产节约计划做为爱国公约的主要内容。制订小组计划并修订爱国公约后，应该进而订立联系合同；经过一定的准备，并应订立集体合同。这对保证增产节约运动有极大的作用。计划订立以后，应该发动群众寻找窍门，开展竞赛，这是保证计划实现的主要方法。“找窍门”变成群众运动后，就可以提高劳动生产率，避免单纯体力竞赛，因而不能巩固持久的缺点。这次竞赛中所以能掀起群众性的找窍门运动，是和质量检查中重视技术学习与推广郭瓦廖夫工作方法分不开的，是与质量检查中加强了技术人员与工人的合作分不开的，是与订增产节约计划时发动群众挖掘潜力的正确做法分不开的，这是一个极大的收获。
    （三）
    此次增产节约运动能够取得上述成绩，是由于各级领导机关紧紧掌握了以下几个方针：
    第一，加强企业中的政治工作。各国营公营工厂认真贯彻了中共中央东北局城市工作会议的精神，大大加强了企业中的政治工作。企业中的行政干部，已经不再忽视政治工作，而是把政治工作看成办好人民企业的关键了。许多厂长和车间主任都亲自参加或直接掌握发动群众的政治工作。党与群众工作干部，由于进一步明确了政治工作必须结合经济工作的方针，逐渐注意学习与钻研生产知识，掌握生产中的关键问题，并摸索与总结了党在企业中保证监督生产的经验，因而提高了政治工作保证监督生产的作用。他们初步学会生产知识以后，他们进行的宣传鼓动工作，已经不再是空洞的说教，而是生动活泼的具有说服力的口号了。这些宣传鼓动工作，是与当前的抗美援朝政治任务以及将来的共产主义远景密切联系着的。
    第二，贯彻了劳动与技术结合，技术人员与工人结合的方针。为了解决产品质量上的主要毛病，各厂矿广泛地开展了合理化建议运动，建立与健全了技术管理制度。增产节约运动以来的找窍门运动，使劳动与技术结合的方针，进一步得到贯彻。劳动与技术相结合的重要标志之一，是技术人员与工人相结合。增产节约运动以来，技术人员的思想改造，有了很大的进步。许多工厂组织了技术人员的政治学习，并展开了技术人员内部的批评与自我批评。通过工厂内部的讨论，报纸的笔谈，技术人员大会的典型报告等，对于技术人员中的作客思想与雇佣态度，轻视劳动与轻视工人的思想以及理论与实际脱节的作风，进行了有效的教育与批判。特别自推广郭瓦廖夫工作方法以来，技术人员从工人的实际操作经验中，得到了实际教育，进一步促进了技术人员与工人的结合。爱国增产节约竞赛彻底改变了过去几次竞赛运动中的体力竞赛现象，与这一正确方针的贯彻是息息相关的。
    第三，贯彻了国家利益与工人利益相结合的方针，实行了奖励制度。各厂正逐步推行计件工资，规定劳动定额。集体合同则是贯彻这一方针的主要组织形式。
    第四，领导干部深入车间，加强车间工作，是贯彻各种方针的重要保证。许多工厂的领导干部，在运动中深入车间（特别是重要车间），掌握生产中的关键问题，研究合理的组织生产的办法，加强车间的技术管理，进而改善企业的经营管理。党与群众工作干部，深入车间掌握群众思想动态，及时地加强政治教育；并依靠党的支部活动，和党员、团员的模范带头作用，团结技术人员与老技术工人，不断解决生产中的关键问题，以保证计划的贯彻。厂部的各种工作，逐渐作到更好地为车间服务。
