Taiyuan City Holds Conference of Model Workers in Industry and Agriculture
Summarize and Exchange Production Experience and Promote the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement

[Our Newspaper] The Taiyuan City Conference of Model Workers in Industry and Agriculture, which began on November 7th, concluded on the 14th. Participants in the conference included representatives from four model factories: Taiyuan Machine Factory, Taiyuan City Telecommunications Command Bureau, Cement Factory, and Chemical Factory; representatives from eighteen model workshops; representatives from one hundred and eighty-five model groups; and two hundred and thirty-nine industrial labor models. Among the agricultural labor models from the city's suburbs, there were representatives from thirty model mutual aid groups and thirty-eight labor models. During the conference, Chairman Mao's great call at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference regarding "continuing to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, requiring increased production and practicing strict economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers" became the direction of all activities of the conference and received a heartfelt response from all labor models. The conference listened to political reports and production summary reports and conducted thorough group discussions. This method of conducting summaries and inspirations from top to bottom and conducting discussions and exchanging experiences from bottom to top brought into play the enthusiasm and wisdom of all labor models, and made extensive exchanges on the experiences of combining politics and economy, increasing production and practicing economy, combining labor and technology, workshop work, and leadership style. Therefore, the conference vividly and practically implemented Chairman Mao's call. All labor models profoundly understood the significance of "increasing production and practicing strict economy" ideologically. It was unanimously clarified that in order to increase production and practice strict economy, it is necessary to oppose corruption and waste; and that clearing assets and verifying funds is the primary and most basic task. Many labor models, in their speeches, used specific facts to illustrate that the current waste phenomenon in state-owned enterprises is very serious; at the same time, they also proved with facts that the potential of existing machinery and equipment, funds, materials, labor, and technology can still be fully utilized to accumulate great wealth for the country. Many labor models have formulated plans to increase production and practice economy and unanimously want to better play a leading role in the new patriotic movement to increase production and practice economy. The Jiao Chongshan Model Group of the Coke Department of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant challenged the industrial labor models present at the meeting to compete in increasing production and practicing economy, which was warmly responded to by everyone. All agricultural labor models in the Fourth District of Taiyuan City's suburbs wrote a letter to Han Chunde, Mayor of Taiyuan City, expressing their determination to "increase production, practice economy, and support the Volunteers" and stated that they must increase the yield per unit area.

Han Chunde, Mayor of Taiyuan City, made a concluding report at the closing ceremony. He pointed out that Taiyuan City is an industrial city, and the democratic reforms of the city's public factories and mines have been successfully concluded, creating more favorable conditions for continuing production reform. The central task of the city's people in the future is to "increase production, practice economy, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers." He then summarized the issues of increasing production and practicing economy, the experience of combining labor and technology, the experience of model workshops, and the experience of labor models leading the masses. Regarding the issue of increasing production and practicing economy, he emphasized that all labor models should clearly recognize ideologically that economy is the basic method for our country to accumulate construction funds and is also a necessary step to consolidate national defense and win victory on the financial and economic front. He also proposed the following aspects of increasing production and practicing economy in industrial and mining enterprises: First, rationally use funds. This is one of the largest sources of increasing production and practicing economy and is also the first step to effectively implement economy from the root. Second, save raw materials and materials, and utilize waste materials. This is the main key to reducing costs. All raw materials, materials, as well as fuels and electricity, must be carefully calculated to achieve the greatest possible savings. Third, adjust the organization and rationally use labor. Some units have too many management personnel and large leading organizations, which need to be appropriately adjusted according to the principles of streamlining and economy, and a certain amount of labor should be drawn out to directly engage in production to reduce management expenses and miscellaneous expenses. More importantly, we must summarize and promote reasonable and scientific working methods in a timely manner, which is the fundamental way to save manpower. Fourth, make full use of existing equipment, improve operating techniques, promote advanced experience, and improve labor productivity. This is the most active and leading aspect of increasing production and practicing economy. Only in this way can we fully utilize the potential of our industrial production. Fifth, do a good job in basic construction work and eliminate the serious waste in basic construction. In the future, we must strengthen the survey, design, and construction supervision of projects and use our best efforts to eliminate waste in this area.

Finally, he called on all labor models to apply the spirit of this conference and the advanced experience learned to actual work and strive to specifically implement Chairman Mao's great call to "increase production, practice economy, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers!" (Shanxi Daily)

    太原市召开工农业劳动模范大会
    总结交流生产经验推广增产节约运动
   【本报讯】太原市工农业劳动模范大会，从十一月七日开始，已于十四日闭幕。参加这次大会的有太原机器厂、太原市电信指挥局、洋灰厂、化学厂四个模范厂的代表，十八个模范车间代表，一百八十五个模范小组代表，和二百三十九个工业劳动模范。市郊区农业劳动模范里，有三十个模范互助组的代表，三十八个劳动模范。大会期间，毛主席在人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议上关于“继续加强抗美援朝的工作，需要增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的伟大号召，成为大会一切活动的方向，得到了全体劳动模范衷心的响应。大会听取了政治报告和生产总结报告，并充分进行了小组讨论。这样自上而下地进行总结启发，和自下而上地进行讨论交流经验的方法，发扬了全体劳动模范的积极性和智慧，对政治与经济结合，增产节约，劳力与技术结合，车间工作，领导作风等问题的经验，作了广泛的交流。因此大会生动地实际地贯彻了毛主席的号召。全体劳动模范从思想上深刻领会了“增加生产，厉行节约”的意义。一致明确了：要想增加生产，厉行节约，必须反对贪污浪费；而清理资产、核定资金，是首要的和最基本的一项工作。许多劳动模范的发言中，以具体事实说明了当前国营企业中的浪费现象是非常严重的；同时也以事实证明，现有的机器设备、资金、材料、劳力、技术的潜在力还可以充分发挥起来，为国家积累很大的财富。许多劳动模范都订出了增产节约的计划，一致要在新的增产节约的爱国运动中，更好地发挥带头作用。太原钢铁厂炼焦部焦崇山模范小组，向到会工业劳动模范挑战，竞赛增产节约，得到了大家的热烈响应。太原市郊区第四区全体农业劳动模范，写信给太原市人民政府韩纯德市长，表示“增产节约，支持志愿军”的决心，一定要提高单位面积产量。
    太原市人民政府韩纯德市长在闭幕时作总结报告，他指出：太原市是个工业城市，全市公营厂矿民主改革已胜利结束，为继续进行生产改革创造了更加有利的条件。今后全市人民的中心任务就是“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”。他接着对增产节约问题，劳力与技术相结合的经验、模范车间的经验和劳动模范带领群众的经验，分别作了总结。关于增产节约的问题，他着重指出：全体劳动模范应从思想上明确认识：节约是我们国家积累建设资金的基本方法，也是巩固国防和争取财经战线上的胜利所必须采取的步骤。他并就增产节约的范围提出在工矿企业中主要地应做好以下几个方面的工作：第一、合理地使用资金。这是增产节约的最大来源之一，也是从根本上有效地实行节约的第一步。第二、节约原料、材料，利用废料。这是降低成本的主要关键。凡属原料、材料以及燃料和电力等都必须精打细算，做到最大可能的节省。第三、调整机构，合理地使用劳动力。某些单位管理人员过多，领导机构庞大，都需要根据精简节约的原则，适当加以调整，抽出一定劳力直接从事生产，以减少管理费用和杂费的开支。更重要的要及时总结、推广合理的、科学的工作方法，这是节省人力的根本办法。第四、充分利用现有设备，改进操作技术，推广先进经验，提高劳动生产率。这是增产节约最积极的主导方面。只有这样，才能充分发挥我们工业生产的潜在能力。第五、搞好基本建设工作，消灭基本建设中严重的浪费现象。今后必须加强工程的勘察、设计，施工的监督工作，用最大努力，肃清这方面的浪费。
    最后，他号召全体劳动模范把这次大会的精神与学到的先进经验，运用到实际工作中去，为具体贯彻毛主席“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的伟大号召而奋斗！（山西日报）
