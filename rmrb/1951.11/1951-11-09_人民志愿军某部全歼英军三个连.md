Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 8th. On the 4th of this month, a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, with the powerful cooperation of artillery fire, launched a fierce counterattack against the British Commonwealth Division on Malian Mountain, 9 kilometers south of Shuoning, northwest of Lianchuan, and completely annihilated three defending enemy companies in one fell swoop. At 3:00 PM on the 4th, after a unit of the Volunteer Army bombarded the enemy's positions with artillery of various calibers, the infantry soldiers immediately launched an assault. The assault team led by Company Commanders Cao Dongfang and Song Jixiang were brave and swift, and captured Height 216.8 in just thirteen minutes, completely annihilating one company of British troops. Other fraternal units successively captured an unnamed height west of Height 216.8, Height 280, and the main peak of Malian Mountain, Height 317. The battle ended at 7:00 PM. A total of three companies of the 28th Brigade of the British Commonwealth Division, the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Companies of the Royal Scottish Regiment, were completely annihilated. According to preliminary statistics, more than 400 enemies were killed or wounded, 200 enemy corpses were left behind, 25 enemies were captured, and 35 light and heavy machine guns, more than 100 rifles, 7 rocket launchers, and 1 60mm mortar were seized. Detailed battle results are being checked. On the 5th, the enemy launched six counterattacks against our Malian Mountain positions one after another, but were all repelled by us, killing and wounding more than 280 enemies, and nearly 100 more enemy corpses were left behind.

Note: During Van Fleet's "Autumn Offensive" in early October, the British Commonwealth Division, under the cover of a large number of aircraft and artillery fire, continuously attacked Malian Mountain for six days and nights, suffering more than 2,600 casualties before occupying the above-mentioned heights on October 7th. After occupying the above-mentioned heights, the enemy stepped up the construction of fortifications day and night, building positions and managing them for nearly a month. However, this time, our army launched a counterattack with a small number of troops, and it only took four hours to completely recover all the positions on this line.

    人民志愿军某部全歼英军三个连
    【新华社朝鲜前线八日电】本月四日，中国人民志愿军某部在强大的炮火配合下，向涟川西北朔宁以南九公里的马良山英军联邦师发起猛烈反击，一举全歼守敌三个连。四日下午三时，志愿军某部在各种口径的大炮猛轰敌人阵地后，步兵战士们立即发起冲锋。由曹东芳、宋吉祥两位连长所率领的突击队，英勇神速，仅十三分钟即攻占二一六点八高地，全歼英军一个连。其他兄弟部队相继攻占二一六点八高地以西一无名高地、二八零高地及马良山主峰三一七高地。战斗于下午七时结束。计全歼守敌英军联邦师二十八旅苏格兰皇家团第二、第三、第四等三个连。据初步统计，毙伤敌四百余名，敌遗尸二百具，俘虏敌二十五名，缴获轻机枪以及重机枪三十五挺，长短枪百余支，火箭筒七个，六○炮一门。详细战果正清查中。五日，敌人向我马良山阵地先后反扑达六次，均被我击退，毙伤敌二百八十余名，敌又遗尸近百具。
    按：在十月上旬范佛里特的“秋季攻势”中，英联邦师在大量飞机炮火掩护下，连续向马良山进攻六昼夜，伤亡二千六百多人，才在十月七日占领了上述数高地。敌人占领上述高地后，日夜加修工事，构筑阵地，经营近月。但此次我军以少数部队举行反击，仅历四小时即将该线阵地全部收复。
