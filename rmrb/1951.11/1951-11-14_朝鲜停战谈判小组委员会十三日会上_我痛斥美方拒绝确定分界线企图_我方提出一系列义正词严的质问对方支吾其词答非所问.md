　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 13th: At the Korean armistice negotiation subcommittee meeting on November 13th, our side's representatives strongly condemned the other side's attempt to delay the armistice negotiations by refusing to immediately determine the military demarcation line and demilitarized zone. Our side's representatives sternly questioned the other side, stating that the other side's formal proposal on November 11th to postpone the specific determination of the military demarcation line and demilitarized zone until the so-called signing of the armistice agreement directly violated the clear provisions of the second agenda item. Given this, was the other side attempting to propose amendments to the agenda? The second agenda item required both sides to indicate where they were willing to cease fire. Since the other side refused to immediately determine the military demarcation line, did the other side refuse to clearly indicate where they were willing to cease fire? Since the other side verbally accepted our side's principle of on-the-spot ceasefire, why did they oppose the immediate specific determination of the existing line of actual contact as the military demarcation line, and the modification of our side's proposal in accordance with the changes in the line of actual contact after the entire armistice agreement was negotiated? Since the military demarcation line proposals put forward by the other side on July 27th, October 25th, and November 8th all advocated immediately determining the military demarcation line and demilitarized zone, why did they oppose immediately determining the military demarcation line and demilitarized zone when our side put forward a fair and reasonable on-the-spot ceasefire plan? The other side has repeatedly stated that if the military demarcation line is to be specifically determined, they should accept their November 8th plan to occupy the Kaesong area. Does the other side's current refusal to determine the military demarcation line mean that they want to indefinitely delay the determination of the military demarcation line until their military delusions are realized, so that the armistice negotiations cannot reach an agreement at all? The US representative, in response to this series of righteous and stern questions raised by our representative, consistently equivocated and gave irrelevant answers, while deliberately pretending not to understand and asking whether our side's suggestion required both sides to immediately cease fighting and withdraw two kilometers each after the military demarcation line was currently determined, in order to spread the distorted propaganda that our side was demanding an immediate ceasefire. Our representative pointed out: In the discussions in the subcommittee meeting, our side has repeatedly stated that the agreement on both sides' troops ceasing fighting and withdrawing from the demilitarized zone after the military demarcation line is determined will naturally be implemented only after the armistice agreement is signed. Moreover, our side's proposal has clearly foreseen in the third item that the line of contact may still change after the military demarcation line is determined. Unless one has ulterior motives, anyone with a little common sense could not misinterpret our side's proposal in any way. Our representative finally stated: The Korean-Chinese delegation, which is responsible to the peace-loving people of the world, absolutely cannot agree to the US side's absurd proposal to refuse to immediately determine the military demarcation line in order to delay the armistice negotiations. Our representative suggested that the subcommittee immediately adopt the four proposals put forward by our side on November 10th so that the delegation assembly could immediately proceed with the discussion of the third agenda item.

　　朝鲜停战谈判小组委员会十三日会上
    我痛斥美方拒绝确定分界线企图
    我方提出一系列义正词严的质问对方支吾其词答非所问
    【新华社开城十三日电】十一月十三日的朝鲜停战谈判小组委员会上，我方代表痛斥对方拒绝即行确定军事分界线和非军事区以拖延停战谈判的企图。我方代表严词质问对方，对方在十一月十一日所提出的将具体确定军事分界线和非军事区的任务推延到所谓停战协议签字前的正式提议，直接破坏了第二项议程的明白规定，既然如此，对方是否企图提出修改议程的建议？第二项议程要求双方表示愿意在什么地方停战，对方既然拒绝即行确定军事分界线，对方是否即拒绝明确表示愿意在什么地方停战？对方既然在口头上接受了我方就地停战的原则，却又为什么反对即行具体确定现有实际接触线为军事分界线，而按照实际接触线的变化在停战协议全部商定后予以修正的我方提议？既然对方在七月二十七日、十月二十五日、十一月八日先后所提出的军事分界线方案都主张即行具体确定军事分界线和非军事区，为什么当我方提出了公平合理的就地停战的方案时，就反对即行确定军事分界线和非军事区？对方曾一再说明如要具体确定军事分界线即应接受他们十一月八日占有开城地区的方案，对方目前拒绝确定军事分界线是否要在他们的军事妄想未能实现前无限期地拖延军事分界线的确定，而使停战谈判根本无从达成协议？美方代表对于我方代表所提出的这一系列义正词严的质问，始终支吾其词，答非所问，却故意装作不懂地询问我方建议是否要求双方在军事分界线目前一旦确定后立即停止战斗，各撤二公里，以便其散布我方要求立即实行停战的歪曲宣传。我方代表指出：在小组会议的讨论中，我方已一再说明军事分界线确定后，双方部队停止战斗和撤出非军事区的协议，自然在停战协议签订后方始执行。何况我方建议第三项已明白预见到军事分界线确定后，接触线仍有可能变化，除非别有用心，任何稍有常识的人就不可能对我方提议有任何曲解。我方代表最后声明：对世界爱好和平的人民负责的朝中代表团绝对不能同意美方拒绝即行确定军事分界线，以拖延停战谈判的荒谬主张。我方代表建议小组委员会立即通过我方在十一月十日提出的四项建议，以便使代表团大会即能进行第三项议程的讨论。
