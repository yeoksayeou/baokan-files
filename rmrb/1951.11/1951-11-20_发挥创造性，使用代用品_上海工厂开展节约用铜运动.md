Shanghai factories are launching a copper conservation campaign, researching and adopting copper substitutes, and have already made initial achievements.

The Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce convened a mobilization meeting at the end of September, gathering representatives from more than 40 relevant industries across the city, calling on all sectors to launch a patriotic copper conservation campaign to use copper materials more rationally to ensure that industries that need copper receive sufficient supply. Over the past two months, some enterprises and institutions have overcome ideas such as "not used to it" and "seeking convenience," and have researched and adopted many copper substitutes. For example, the thermos bottle industry, which was the earliest to adopt copper substitutes, now uses bamboo shells instead of the original copper or iron shells in 70 percent of its total output, reducing costs by more than four-fifths. The electrical equipment industry, which uses the most copper, recently established a copper conservation committee. Private Defu Electrical Equipment Factory and Yizhong Porcelain Electrical Factory have both created substitutes for copper flashlight shells. Bao Guangze, an engineer at Yizhong Porcelain Electrical Factory, used waste paper, old cloth, and other materials to make a laminated material that can be used to replace copper flashlight shells. The light bulb industry is also experimenting with using porcelain or bakelite instead of copper to manufacture lamp holders. In order to supply the needs of various light bulb factories, Huadian Porcelain Factory has refurbished five pressing machines for manufacturing porcelain lamp holders, with a daily output of up to 10,000 pieces. In other examples, the copper cover on the fire extinguishers produced by the Zhendan Machinery Factory has been partially replaced with pig iron sheet, saving approximately two tons of copper material per month. The new iron sheet cover not only reduces costs, but is also safer and more durable than the copper cover after improvements. The private Yuanji Gas Lamp Factory has replaced copper with iron to manufacture gas lamps, saving 80 percent of copper material, and the newly made gas lamp fuel tank has also been made smooth and rust-resistant.

These achievements have greatly enhanced the confidence of various industries in continuing to adopt substitutes and conserve copper. However, some industries or users still do not attach enough importance to the issue of copper conservation. For example, the copper lock industry uses about 270,000 catties of copper per month, and many copper products can also be replaced with iron, copper-plated iron, etc. The badge enamel industry produces 130,000 commemorative badges per month. Some practices, such as some factories excessively issuing commemorative badges for holding anti-US and aid-Korea picture exhibitions or some industrial trade unions excessively issuing them for holding half-day sports meets, are completely unnecessary and wasteful. In response to these situations, the Shanghai industrial copper conservation campaign must be further deepened and expanded on the existing foundation.

### 发挥创造性，使用代用品  上海工厂开展节约用铜运动

　　发挥创造性，使用代用品
    上海工厂开展节约用铜运动
    上海市许多工厂正展开节约用铜运动，研究和采用铜的代用品，已有初步成绩。
    上海市工商业联合会在九月底曾召集全市四十多个有关行业的代表举行动员大会，号召各业展开爱国主义的节约用铜运动，更合理地使用铜料，以保证必要用铜的工业得到充足的供应。两个月来，部分企业单位已克服了“用不惯”、“图便利”等思想，研究出和采用了不少铜的代用品。如最早采用铜代用品的热水瓶工业，目前占全部产量百分之七十的产品已采用竹壳代替原来的铜壳或铁壳，使成本减低五分之四以上。用铜最多的电工器材工业，最近已成立了节约用铜委员会。私营德孚电工器材厂和益中瓷电厂等都创制了手电筒铜壳的代用品。益中瓷电厂工程师鲍光泽利用废纸旧布等制成一种层压材料，可用以代替手电筒铜壳。灯泡工业亦正试用瓷或胶木代替铜质制造灯头，华电瓷业厂为供应各灯泡厂的需要，已将五部制造瓷质灯头的压力机整理出来，日产量可达一万只。其他如震旦机器厂出产的灭火机上的铜盖头，已有一部分改用生铁皮制造，每月可节约铜料二吨左右。该厂新制的铁皮盖头不但成本减低，而且经过改进后比铜盖还要安全牢固。私营源记汽灯厂以铁代铜制造汽灯后，节约铜料百分之八十，新制汽灯的油壶也已做到光滑不易生锈。
    这些成绩大大提高了各业继续采用代用品、节约用铜的信心。但目前尚有一些行业或用户对节约用铜这件事不够重视。如铜锁工业每月用铜约二十七万斤，其中许多铜的制品也可用铁、铁上镀铜等来代替。徽章珐琅工业每月生产的纪念章有十三万枚。其中如某些工厂开抗美援朝画片展览会、某产业工会开半天运动会也都滥发纪念章等，都是完全可以节省的。针对这些情况，上海工业节约用铜运动，还要在现有基础上进一步深入扩大。
