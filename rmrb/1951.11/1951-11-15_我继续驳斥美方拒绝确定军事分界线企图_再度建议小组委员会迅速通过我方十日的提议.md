Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, November 14th: At the subcommittee meeting of the Korean armistice negotiations on the 14th, our representative continued to refute the other side's attempt to delay the armistice negotiations by violating the agenda and refusing to determine the military demarcation line and demilitarized zone. Our representative once again sternly questioned whether the other side refused to indicate where it was willing to cease fire; the other side's previous military demarcation line proposals all advocated the immediate concrete establishment of a military demarcation line and demilitarized zone, so why, when our side proposed a fair and reasonable plan for ceasefire in place, did they advocate overturning the agenda and refusing to immediately determine the military demarcation line. The other side, unable to justify itself, refused to answer our questions directly, but still arbitrarily claimed that our suggestion of November 10 was a demand to immediately determine an unchangeable military demarcation line, demanding a so-called "de facto ceasefire." Our representative pointed out that not only had our side never put forward any suggestion that could be interpreted as a demand for a de facto ceasefire, but on the contrary, in our proposal of November 10, it was clearly stipulated that the now-determined military demarcation line and demilitarized zone would be modified after the entire armistice agreement was agreed upon, according to changes in the actual line of contact. Therefore, the other side had no excuse to oppose our suggestion. If the other side did not have ulterior motives, it would not have refused our suggestion, let alone continue to distort the facts, entangle the subcommittee's discussions, and delay the decision. Our representative reiterated the suggestion that the subcommittee swiftly adopt our fair and reasonable proposal of November 10, which took into account the opinions of both sides, so that the delegation conference could immediately enter into the discussion of the third item on the agenda.

    我继续驳斥美方拒绝确定军事分界线企图
　　再度建议小组委员会迅速通过我方十日的提议
    【新华社开城十四日电】十四日的朝鲜停战谈判小组委员会上，我方代表继续驳斥对方违反议程的规定，拒绝确定军事分界线和非军事区，以拖延停战谈判的企图。我方代表再度严词质问对方是否拒绝表示愿在何地停战；对方以往的军事分界线方案都主张即行具体确立军事分界线和非军事区，何以当我方提出就地停战的公平合理的方案时，又主张推翻议程的规定，拒绝即行确定军事分界线。对方理屈辞穷，拒绝正面答复我方质问，却仍然武断地声称我方十一月十日的建议是要求立即确定一条不可变更的军事分界线，要求所谓“事实上的停火”。我方代表指出：我方不仅从未提出过任何可以解释为要求事实上停火的建议，而相反的，在我方十一月十日的提议中，明确地规定了现在确定的军事分界线和非军事区，将按照实际接触线的变化，在停战协议全部商定后加以修正。因此，对方没有任何藉口可以反对我方的建议。对方如果不是另有不可告人的目的，就不可能对我方建议有任何拒绝，更不应该继续歪曲事实，使小组会议的讨论纠缠不清，拖延不决。我方代表再度建议小组委员会迅速通过我方十一月十日的照顾了双方意见的公平合理的提议，使代表团大会可以立即进入第三项议程的讨论。
