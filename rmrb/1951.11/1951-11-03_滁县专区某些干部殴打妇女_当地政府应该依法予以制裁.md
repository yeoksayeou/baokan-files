    Some Cadres in Chuxian Special District Beat Women; Local Government Should Impose Sanctions According to Law
   Editor: Some cadres in the Chuxian Special District of northern Anhui often beat women. The local government should quickly sanction them according to law. For example, Guo Jinshan, the director of the Wengji Village Farmers' Association in Tianwang Township, Binghui County, has beaten his wife more than 20 times since September of this year. Twice, he strangled his wife's throat with both hands, almost killing her. Chen Jiacai, deputy director of the Yongning Township Farmers' Association in Jiangpu County, beat his daughter-in-law, Zhang Dilan, black and blue all over because she chatted with her younger brother-in-law on a bench before attending night school. On September 9th, Wang Wenyou, the captain of the public security team of the Chuxian County Public Security Bureau, locked the door at home and beat his wife. Gong Daocheng, the village chief of Huayuan Village, Tiefu Township, Lai'an County, beat his wife twice in ten days. His wife was sick, but Gong Daocheng still forced her to go up the mountain to cut grass, and did not give her food when she returned home. These cadres who beat women have a strong feudal ideology, and they believe that beating and scolding women is a matter of course. This behavior has had a very bad influence among the masses and has hindered the implementation of the Marriage Law. I suggest that the local government take effective measures to stop this phenomenon of abuse of women and sanction the illegal cadres according to law.
    North Anhui Chuxian People's Government Ming Yuan
    Editor's note: Some cadres in the Chuxian Special District of northern Anhui often beat women, which is a feudal and barbaric act and is illegal. The leading organs of the Chuxian Special District should deeply publicize the Marriage Law, correct the feudal ideology among cadres, and give appropriate punishment to cadres who abuse women.

    滁县专区某些干部殴打妇女
    当地政府应该依法予以制裁
   编辑同志：皖北滁县专区某些干部经常殴打妇女，当地政府应该迅速依法制裁他们。如炳辉县天王乡翁集村农会主任郭金山，从今年九月起，共打老婆二十余次，有两次用双手勒住老婆的?子，几乎勒死。江浦县永宁乡农会副主任陈家才，因为他媳妇张弟兰在夜校学习前，和她小叔子在一条板凳上闲谈，就把张弟兰打得满身青肿。九月九日，滁县公安局公安队王文友队长在家里关起门来打老婆。来安县铁佛乡花园村村长巩道成在十天内打媳妇两次。媳妇有病，但巩道成仍强迫她上山砍草，回家来还不给她饭吃。这些殴打妇女的干部，是具有浓厚的封建思想的，他们认为打骂妇女是天经地义的事。这种行为在群众中已造成很不好的影响，妨碍了婚姻法的贯彻执行。我建议当地政府应采取有效办法，制止这种虐待妇女的现象，并依法制裁违法干部。
    皖北滁县人民政府    明远
    编者按：皖北滁县专区某些干部经常殴打妇女，是一种封建的野蛮的行为，是违法的。滁县专区领导机关应该深入宣传婚姻法，纠正干部中的封建思想，并对虐待妇女的干部给予适当处分。
