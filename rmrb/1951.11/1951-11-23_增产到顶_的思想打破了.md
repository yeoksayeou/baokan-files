    The Idea of "Production Increase Reaching its Limit" is Shattered
    Wang Jiaqian
    Editor's Note: Due to the rapid recovery and development of agricultural production in our country, many farmers have developed the erroneous idea that "production increase has reached its limit." This idea is extremely conservative, and it hinders the continued improvement of yield per unit area. Wuxi County organized farmers to visit advanced areas to break this erroneous conservative thinking, and this method should be promoted in various regions.

    Last year and this year, Wuxi County had bumper rice harvests. Generally, each mu (0.16 acres) reached 500 to 600 jin (250-300 kg), and some individual cases reached 700 to 800 jin. Therefore, farmers generally developed the idea that "production increase has reached its limit." They believed: "This year's efforts have been thorough, fertilizers have been fully applied, and there is no way to increase production any further."

    On October 12th, Wuxi County held a county-level farmers' representative meeting. The responsible comrade of the CPC County Committee, based on the news from the Southern Jiangsu Daily, told the representatives that Tang Baoming, a farmer from Mazhen Township in Jiangyin County, had harvested 1,200 jin of rice per mu. Upon hearing this, the representatives immediately started discussing: "Harvesting 1,200 jin per mu, unless he has some magical power." "His field is probably as big as two mu!" "Since ancient times, no one has ever heard of rice yielding 1,200 jin per mu." The labor models from various districts were even more disbelieving. Zhu Balang, a labor model from Nanquan District, thought: "I, Zhu Balang, am the best at farming. Everyone in my village knows that. I only harvested 800 jin at most. How could Tang Baoming harvest 1,200 jin!" The representatives proposed to the conference that they wanted to measure Tang Baoming's field and count his rice grains. The comrade presiding over the conference, based on this situation, decided to select one representative from each district, led by Comrade Lu Naichang from the rural work team, to visit Jiangyin and learn from Tang Baoming's experience.

    The representatives talked and discussed all the way. Although they did not believe that one mu of land could yield 1,200 jin, they couldn't completely disbelieve the words of the leading comrades and the news from the Southern Jiangsu Daily. Halfway through, Xu Juchu, the representative from Bashi District, suddenly said: "Mazhen Township relies on our Bashi District. Last time, a relative of Tang Baoming came to our village, and he said that Tang Baoming only harvested 700 to 800 jin. The person who submitted the article to the Southern Jiangsu Daily, knowing that he exaggerated too much, has already run away in fear. Tang Baoming himself is hiding at home and doesn't dare to come out." After he said this, several representatives immediately requested to go back, but some other representatives said: "Even if it's fake, we have to go and find out what's ‘fake’." In this way, they continued to move forward. When they arrived at Xiyang Bridge, only three or four li (1.5-2 km) away from Mazhen Township, they heard local farmers say that Tang Baoming really only harvested 700 to 800 jin per mu. At this time, even the comrade leading the team dared not believe the news from the Southern Jiangsu Daily. But in order to complete his task, he had to say to the representatives: "Even if he only harvests 700 to 800 jin per mu, that is still higher than our general yield. We can still go and learn from his experience!"

    When they arrived at the township government, the township head Huang Peichun took out a rice plant with large ears and full grains for everyone to see, explaining that this grew in his own field and yielded at most 1,060 jin per mu. His farming method was learned from Tang Baoming's father. He also told the representatives that there was a military dependent in the township named Huang Kunlin, who once came to the township government to get a certificate to sell 24 dan (1 dan = 100 kg) of rice to buy wood to build a house. The comrades, concerned about his family's life, asked him to sell less. Huang Kunlin said: "My yield will not be lower than Tang Baoming's. Selling 24 dan of rice is just like plucking a hair from an ox." It turned out that his six mu of land had yielded 7,000 jin of rice. At this time, the representatives couldn't wait to go to Tang Baoming's home to see for themselves, but Township Head Huang stopped them. Township Head Huang said: The local people are afraid of increasing the burden, and they all resent Tang Baoming for "shouldn't get rich and burden others," so Tang Baoming has a lot of concerns in his mind. Therefore, it was decided to bring him to the township government to talk.

    When Tang Baoming came to the township government to introduce his experience, the representatives realized that he had many farming methods that were more advanced than their own. First of all, he paid attention to seed selection. The rice he planted was "Huanggu Early 20th," and for more than 30 years, he had selected the ears once every year or every other year, choosing the three-flat-top or four-flat-top that were neither too old nor too young three to five days before harvest. This kind of rice has large ears and thick, stiff stalks, which can resist wind and rice borers. Because it has to spike before August 15th, the third generation of rice stem borers needs to hatch after August 15th. At this time, because the rice stalks are old, it can no longer bore holes in them. His fertilization method is to apply the base fertilizer all at once and not apply top dressing afterwards. He said that this can make the rice grow vigorously from the beginning, and that applying top dressing will make the rice not grow old for a long time and easily suffer from insect pests (Note: His soil is good, and because the early rice growth period is short, this method may be suitable. Whether other fields are not suitable for top dressing remains to be studied). In addition to being more careful than others in general life, Tang Baoming's most outstanding achievement is his skillful use of water. In order to let the sun heat the fields and promote rice development, he usually keeps the water in his fields only two inches deep. When the rice is spiking, he often irrigates the water at night and releases the water during the day to harden the soil, strengthen the rice roots, and prevent lodging.

    The representatives admired Tang Baoming's farming experience and asked him how much he could actually harvest per mu. At first, he was still worried and only said 700 to 800 jin, but at this time, the representatives helped him to clear his mind. Li Guisheng, the labor model from Outang District, said: "Comrade Tang, we are all one family. The People's Government has policies, and more harvest does not mean more grain to hand over to the state. It is an honor for you to produce well." Everyone calculated for him again: "The average field in Wuxi still yields 600 jin, your rice variety is good, there are no planthoppers in the field, the fertilizer is sufficient, and the effort is meticulous, so of course you will harvest a lot more." At this time, Tang Baoming explained that he harvested 417 bundles of rice per mu, with 24 plants per bundle, 20 to 30 seedlings per plant, at least 150 grains per ear, generally 220 grains, and at most 300 grains, with an average weight of one qian (5 grams) per ear, and about three jin per bundle. Although this year was affected by typhoons, the highest yielding mu still yielded 1,200 jin.

    Everyone went to Tang Baoming's home and saw that his rice plants were indeed thick and strong. Taking a plant and standing it upright, the rice stalk was straight, and the heavy rice ears bent down at the top like hooks. The representatives thought that if they stood up the rice from their own homes, the rice stalks would be bent into an arc shape by the ears. Opening the rice stalks, although there were rice borers inside, they did not cause the rice to turn into empty husks. The soil in the rice fields was inky black, and there was not a single weed on the banks.

    The representatives immediately bought rice seeds and asked for some rice plants, returning as if they had obtained a treasure. On the way, they not only did not say that the Southern Jiangsu Daily was exaggerating, but also said: "Like Tang Baoming, he should be selected as a special-class model to see Chairman Mao." Some people calculated: "This year, we have all planted Tang Baoming's rice seeds in each district, and in three to five years, it can be widely spread." Someone supplemented him: "Tang Baoming's high yield is not entirely due to good rice seeds!"

    When they returned to the meeting place, they didn't even eat, and they kept telling everyone about the visit. Li Guisheng, the labor model from Outang District, gave a particularly systematic report to the conference. After listening to the report and seeing Tang Baoming's rice with their own eyes, the more than 700 representatives of the county eliminated the idea that "production increase has reached its limit," and many representatives prepared to experiment next year according to Tang Baoming's method.

### “增产到顶”的思想打破了

    “增产到顶”的思想打破了
    汪家千
    编者按：由于我国农业生产的迅速恢复发展，许多农民产生了“增产到顶”的错误思想。这种思想是极端保守的，它障碍着单位面积产量的继续提高。无锡县组织农民到先进地区参观，来打破这种错误的保守思想，各地应该推广这种方法。
    去年和今年，无锡县稻子丰产。一般每亩都达到五百至六百斤，个别高的达到七、八百斤。因此，农民普遍产生了“增产到顶”的思想。他们认为：“今年功夫已经道地，肥料已经加足，以后再也没有办法增产了。”
    十月十二日，无锡县召开县农民代表会，中共县委负责同志根据苏南日报的消息，告诉代表：江阴县马镇乡的农民唐宝铭，每亩田收了稻子一千二百斤。代表们听了，当场纷纷议论：“每亩收一千二百斤，除非他有仙法。”“他的田大概一亩有两亩大吧！”“从古以来就没听说稻子每亩能收一千二百斤。”各区劳动模范更不相信。南泉区劳动模范朱八郎想：“我朱八郎种田是最好的了，我乡周围老小都知道，我顶多只收了八百斤，他唐宝铭那能收一千二百斤呢！”代表们向大会提出，要去丈丈唐宝铭的田，数数他的稻个头。主持大会的同志根据这种情况，决定每区推一代表，由农村工作团的卢乃昌同志带领，到江阴参观，向唐宝铭学习经验。
    代表们一路讲讲说说。他们虽然不相信一亩田能收一千二百斤，但是对于领导同志的话和苏南日报的消息，又不好完全不信。走在半途，八士区代表徐菊初忽然说：“马镇乡就靠我们八士区，前次唐宝铭有个亲戚，来我们庄上，他说唐宝铭只收了七、八百斤。那个给苏南日报投稿的人，知道自己吹牛吹得太大，已经吓跑了。唐宝铭自己也躲在家里不敢出来了。”经他这一说，有几个代表马上要求回去，但另外一些代表说：“就是假的，我们也要去弄得个‘假’出来。”这样，他们才继续往前走。来到西暘桥，离马镇乡只有三四里了，又听当地农民说，唐宝铭真的只收了七、八百斤一亩。这时连带队的同志也不敢相信苏南日报的消息了。但他为了完成自己的任务，又不得不向代表们说：“就是他每亩田只收七、八百斤，那也比我们一般产量高，我们也可以去学学他的经验呀！”
    到乡政府，乡长黄培春拿出一棵穗子长大、粒粒饱满的稻子来给大家看，说明这是他自己田长的，每亩顶多收了一千零六十斤。他种田的办法是跟唐宝铭父亲学习的。他又告诉代表们，本乡有个军属黄坤林，有一次来乡政府打证明书，要卖二十四担稻，买木料盖房子，同志们关心他家生活，叫他少卖一些，黄坤林说：“我的产量不会低于唐宝铭，卖二十四担稻，也不过是牯牛身上拔根毛。”原来他六亩多田，收了七千斤稻子。这时代表们恨不得马上到唐宝铭家里看看，但黄乡长阻止了他们，黄乡长说：当地群众害怕增加负担，都怨唐宝铭“不该自己发财连累别人”，因此唐宝铭思想上很有顾虑。所以便决定把他找来乡政府谈谈。
    当唐宝铭到乡政府介绍经验的时候，代表们才知道，他有许多种田的办法，都比自己高明。首先他注意选种。他种的稻是“黄谷早二十日”，三十多年来，每年或隔年穗选一次，在收割前三、五日，到田里选不老不嫩的三平顶或四平顶。这种稻的穗子大，秆子粗硬，可以抗风避螟。因为它在八月十五以前就要抽齐穗子。而三化螟的第三代须要到八月十五以后才孵化，这时因稻秆长老，它已不能在上面打洞了。他施肥的办法是把基肥一次施足，以后不再追肥。他说这样可以使稻子一开始就长得旺，又说施追肥会使稻子迟迟不长老，容易遭虫害（按：他的田土壤好，并由于早稻成长期短，可能适宜于这种办法，其他田是否均不宜施追肥尚待研究）。唐宝铭除一般生活都比别人做得仔细以外，最突出的就是用水得法。为了让太阳把田晒热，促使稻子发育，平常他田里的水只保持两寸深。到稻子抽穗时，他经常夜里把水灌进，白天把水放出，使泥土发硬，稻根长牢，不易困倒。
    代表们都钦佩唐宝铭的种田经验，又问他究竟每亩能收多少。开始他还有顾虑，只说收七、八百斤，但这时代表们反而给他打通思想了。藕塘区代表李桂生说：“唐同志，我们都是一家人，人民政府有政策，多收又不多交公粮，你生产好是光荣的。”大家又给他算了一次账：“无锡一般田还收六百斤，你的稻种好，田里没有白蛸，肥料足，功夫细，当然要多收很多。”这时唐宝铭才说明他每亩田收四百一十七束稻子，每束二十四棵，每棵二、三十株稻，每穗至少一百五十粒，一般二百二十粒，最多三百粒，平均每穗一钱重，每束约三斤。今年虽受台风，顶高的一亩田还收了一千二百斤。
    大家去唐宝铭家里一看，他的稻棵的确是又粗又壮，拿一棵竖起来，稻秆笔直，沉重的稻穗，像钩子一样在顶上弯下来。代表们想，如果把自己家里的稻竖起来，稻秆就要被穗子坠成一个弯弓形了。剥开稻秆看，里面虽有螟虫，但它并没有使稻子长成白蛸。稻田里土色墨黑，岸脚边没有一棵杂草。
    代表们当场买了稻种，要了些稻棵，如获至宝地转回来。一路上不但不说苏南日报吹牛，而且说：“像唐宝铭这样，应该选成特等模范去见毛主席。”有人计算着：“今年我们每区都种了唐宝铭的稻种，三五年后可以普遍传开了。”又有人给他补充：“唐宝铭收得多，并不完全都靠稻种好呀！”
    他们回到开会的地方，连饭也不吃，就滔滔不断地向大家叙述着参观的经过，藕塘区劳动模范李桂生还特别有系统的向大会作了报告。全县七百余代表，听了报告并且亲眼看了唐宝铭的稻子，“增产到顶”的思想就消除了，很多代表并且准备明年照唐宝铭的办法进行实验。
