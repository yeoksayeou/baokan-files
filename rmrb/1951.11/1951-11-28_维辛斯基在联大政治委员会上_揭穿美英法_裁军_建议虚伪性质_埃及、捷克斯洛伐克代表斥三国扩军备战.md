Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 27th: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly held continuous meetings from the 19th to the 24th to discuss the proposal put forward by the United States, Britain, and France, euphemistically named "Regulation, Limitation, and Balanced Reduction of All Armed Forces and All Armaments."

During the continuous meetings, representatives of the United States and its vassal states tried their best to defend this proposal. But their rhetoric only further illustrated the hypocrisy of the three countries' proposal. French newspapers daily cited many facts to prove that the "love for peace" expressed by American and Western European diplomats at the United Nations General Assembly was nothing more than a smokescreen, aimed at concealing the frantic preparations for a new war being carried out by the US-British bloc.

The US representative, US Secretary of State Acheson, delivered a lengthy speech at the meeting on the 19th, attempting to make people believe that the three countries' proposal could become a turning point toward stopping the expansion of armaments and eliminating international tension. However, he could not present any convincing arguments to prove his assertion. He could not deny that the three countries' proposal was merely a proposal for investigating armaments, using empty talk of determining armament levels to replace the fundamental tasks of disarmament, banning atomic weapons, and establishing effective international control to supervise the implementation of the ban. Acheson wanted to prove that the three countries' proposal stipulated the banning of atomic weapons, but he admitted that the three countries' proposal was based on the so-called "Baruch Plan" on this issue. This long-bankrupt plan not only does not stipulate the banning of atomic weapons, but on the contrary allows the United States to manufacture and stockpile atomic bombs without restriction. Acheson also said that international tensions must be eliminated before talking about reducing armaments. But everyone knows that it is the aggressive policy of the United States that has caused the current international tensions. In this way, Acheson once again confirmed that the three countries' proposal has nothing in common with a serious effort to stop the expansion of armaments and ban atomic weapons.

The representatives of France and Britain also spoke at the meeting, defending the three countries' proposal. Representatives of other countries in the US-British bloc also spoke in support of the three countries' proposal. In their speeches, they could not but admit that the US-British bloc countries are frantically expanding their armaments, placing heavy burdens on the people, and that the people demand genuine disarmament and effective measures to ensure peace. But they still expressed their support for the three countries' proposal.

The Egyptian representative, speaking at the meeting on the 22nd, emphasized that Egypt needs peace and is unwilling to become a battlefield for another world war. He questioned the fact that Western countries' words and deeds do not match, and said that the impression he got after listening to the speeches at the meeting was that the methods proposed by the United States, Britain, and France would place the world under their rule. The Egyptian representative said that from the three countries' proposal, it seems that the United States wants to postpone the issue of banning atomic weapons indefinitely, but the whole world believes that atomic bombs must be declared illegal immediately. When the Egyptian representative talked about the so-called statement that the conclusion of the North Atlantic Treaty and the principles of the United Nations Charter do not conflict, he claimed that the three countries intended to use the same statement to cover up another group they are forming - the Mediterranean group. The Egyptian representative pointed out that some groups can never be called regional groups because they are not established based on the commonality of political, economic, and cultural interests, nor are they established in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter, but for purposes that have nothing to do with consolidating peace.

The head of the Czechoslovak delegation, Sekaninová, in her speech at the meeting on the 21st, sternly pointed out that the three countries' proposal has nothing in common with the task of reducing the burden of armaments and easing international tensions. Its purpose is only to postpone indefinitely the primary tasks of disarmament, banning atomic weapons, and establishing international supervision demanded by the people of all countries, and to use empty talk of reducing armaments to conceal the intention of continuing to prepare for a new war.

The head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, spoke at the meeting on the 24th. He analyzed the speeches of the representatives of the United States, Britain, France, and other countries, and based on irrefutable facts, exposed the hypocritical nature of the three countries' proposal. In his speech, Vyshinsky raised a series of questions about eliminating war and reducing armaments, asking the initiators and supporters of the three countries' proposal to clearly state their position. Vyshinsky also submitted the Soviet delegation's amendments to the three countries' proposal, asking the Political Committee to consider them.

    维辛斯基在联大政治委员会上
    揭穿美英法“裁军”建议虚伪性质
    埃及、捷克斯洛伐克代表斥三国扩军备战
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：联合国大会政治委员会从十九日到二十四日连日举行会议，讨论美、英、法三国提出的美其名为“规定、限制和均衡地裁减一切武装部队和一切军备”的建议。
    在连日会议上，美国及其仆从国家的代表竭力为这个建议辩解。但是他们的辞藻只是更说明三国建议的虚伪。法国报纸每天都举出许多事实证明：美国和西欧外交官员们在联合国大会会场里所表露的“对和平的爱”只不过是种烟幕，目的在于掩饰美英集团正在狂热进行的新战争的准备工作。
    美国代表、美国国务卿艾奇逊在十九日会议上发表长篇演说，企图使人相信三国建议可以成为走向停止扩张军备和消除国际紧张局势的转折点。但是，他却不能提出任何有力的论据来证明他的论断。他无法否认，三国建议不过是一个调查军备的建议，是以确定军备水平的空谈来代替裁军、禁止原子武器以及建立有效的国际管制以监督禁令的执行等基本工作。艾奇逊想要证明三国建议中规定了禁止原子武器，但他又承认三国建议在这个问题上是以所谓“巴鲁区计划”为根据的。这个早已破产了的计划不但不规定禁止原子武器，而且相反地让美国可以毫无限制地制造并囤积原子弹。艾奇逊并说，在谈到裁减军备以前，必须消除国际紧张关系。但是大家知道，正是美国的侵略政策造成了目前的国际紧张关系。这样，艾奇逊就再次证实了，三国建议和认真努力制止扩张军备运动及禁止原子武器是毫无共同之处的。
    法国和英国的代表也在会上发言，为三国建议辩护。在会上发言支持三国建议的还有其他美英集团国家的代表，他们在发言中不能不承认美英集团各国正在疯狂地扩张军备，给人民加上沉重的负担，人民要求真正裁减军备和切实保障和平的措施。但他们仍表示拥护三国建议。
    埃及代表在二十二日会议上发言，着重说明埃及需要和平，不愿意成为另一次大战的战场。他就西方国家言行不符的事实提出责问，并说，他在听了会上的发言以后得到的印象是：美、英、法三国所提出的办法将置世界于它们的统治之下。埃及代表说，从三国建议看来，美国要把禁止原子武器问题无限期地拖下去，但是，全世界都认为必须立即宣布原子弹为非法。埃及代表在谈到所谓缔结北大西洋公约和联合国宪章原则并不抵触的说法时声称，三国打算用同样说法来掩饰它们正在筹组的另一个集团——地中海集团。埃及代表指出，有些集团绝不能叫做区域集团，因为它们不是根据政治、经济和文化利益的共同性，也不是按照联合国宪章的原则成立的，而是为了与巩固和平毫不相干的目的而成立的。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表团团长塞卡尼诺娃在二十一日会议上的发言中，严正指出三国建议和减轻军备负担、缓和国际紧张气氛的任务毫无共同之处，其目的只是要把各国人民所要求的裁军、禁止原子武器和建立国际监督的首要任务无限期地拖延下去，用裁减军备的空谈来掩饰继续准备新战争的意图。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基在二十四日会议上发言。他分析了美、英、法等国代表的发言，并根据无可辩驳的事实，揭穿了三国建议的虚伪性质。维辛斯基在发言中提出了一连串关于消弭战争和裁减军备的问题，要求三国建议的发起人和支持者明确表明态度。维辛斯基并对三国建议提出苏联代表团的修正案，请政治委员会考虑。
