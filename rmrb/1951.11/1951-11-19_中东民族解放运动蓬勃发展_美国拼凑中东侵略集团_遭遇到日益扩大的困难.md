Xinhua News Agency, 18th. After the Egyptian government declared its refusal to participate in the "Middle East Command," US-British imperialism is still stepping up its efforts to piece together a Middle East aggression bloc. However, due to the increasingly strong opposition from the people of the Middle East and the further sharpening of contradictions between the US and Britain in the Middle East, the difficulties facing this conspiracy are expanding.

On October 27th and 28th, the United States, Britain, France, and Turkey "notified" the governments of Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Israel, stating their "intention to continue organizing the Middle East defense zone regardless of Egypt's actions." On November 9th, the four countries again "notified" the governments of Middle Eastern countries, reiterating their "intention to continue with the plan to establish a joint command in the region." On the 10th, the four countries issued a statement of so-called "principles" for the establishment of the "Middle East Command," which specifically mentioned that all participating countries could expect to receive assistance from the "initiating country" (mainly referring to the United States) in terms of "munitions and equipment." Simultaneously with these diplomatic statements of inducement and coercion for Middle Eastern countries to participate in the Middle East bloc, the United States, Britain, and other countries conducted intense diplomatic activities in the capitals of Arab countries and in Paris, where the Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly is being held. Gardner, the US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and African Affairs, is "touring" Arab countries. According to the Lebanese "Beirut Daily," Gardner's trip is aimed at discussing the Middle East military bloc plan with Arab political leaders. Eight members of the US Congress also "visited" Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, on November 9th. In Paris, according to a United Press report on the 13th: "Britain has concluded a series of negotiations with Arab leaders who are there (attending the United Nations General Assembly)"; representatives of Arab countries are currently holding a meeting of the Arab League in Paris to discuss their attitude towards the "Middle East Command."

However, the environment for the United States to carry out these activities has become increasingly unfavorable. The obstacle the United States has encountered is, first and foremost, the vigorous national liberation movement throughout the Arab and North African regions, from Iran to Morocco. The spearhead of this movement is also directly aimed at the United States. Because the people of the Middle East are unwilling to be cannon fodder for the Americans, they have increasingly powerfully opposed the plan for a Middle East aggression bloc. Scripps-Howard newspaper commentator Denney admitted on October 11th that the "flames" in the Middle East are "gradually getting out of control. Now that they threaten to destroy the allied Middle East defense (should read as aggression) system, it is no longer just a question of what harm British interests will suffer." The governments of Middle Eastern countries have also expressed suspicion and resistance to the US policy of asking them to pull chestnuts out of the fire. A United Press dispatch from London on October 20th said with distress that the leaders of the entire Muslim world "have expressed support for neutrality." The "New York Times" correspondent in the Middle East also recently wrote: "The idea of establishing a neutral group of Muslim states is very popular." In response to the "notifications" from the United States, Britain, France, and Turkey, the Saudi Arabian government replied to the four countries, saying, "If Egypt's demands are not met, it will be impossible to discuss the four countries' proposals for joint Middle East defense." Under this situation, even some figures within the ruling groups of Middle Eastern countries who advocate participation in the Middle East bloc have found it difficult to act arbitrarily. Syrian Prime Minister Hakim was forced to resign on the 10th because he publicly advocated participation in the "Middle East Command."

At the same time, in addition to preparing for an anti-Soviet war, another purpose of the United States in piecing together the Middle East bloc is to seize the British Empire's dominant position in the Middle East. This has aroused serious dissatisfaction in Britain, thereby intensifying the backstage disputes between the United States and Britain. An Agence France-Presse dispatch from Washington on October 7th revealed that "well-informed sources" in Washington openly believe that "Britain is no longer able to maintain its former great power status, and the United States should directly replace British influence in the Middle East." The United States is also attempting to use the "anti-British sentiment" in the Middle East to achieve its goals. The American-published "Middle East Journal" recently admitted that the United States and Britain are implementing different policies in their struggle for hegemony in the Middle East, "only in their opposition to the national liberation movement and communism are they consistent."

In the face of this situation, although US imperialism is actively carrying out its activities to piece together a Middle East aggression bloc, it obviously cannot help but feel that the future is bleak. A United Press dispatch from Washington on October 17th said: "The United States is eager to find new tactics to prevent the Western countries' plans to defend (should read as invade) the troubled spots of the Near East and Middle East from collapsing, but the future is not optimistic. ... In the current atmosphere, there is an increasing widespread belief that the United States will be unable to contain a series of stubborn actions that endanger Western defense plans (referring to the Middle East aggression bloc plan)."

### 中东民族解放运动蓬勃发展  美国拼凑中东侵略集团  遭遇到日益扩大的困难

    中东民族解放运动蓬勃发展
    美国拼凑中东侵略集团
    遭遇到日益扩大的困难
    【新华社十八日讯】在埃及政府声明拒绝参加“中东司令部”以后，美英帝国主义仍在加紧进行拼凑中东侵略集团的活动。但是，由于中东人民日趋强烈的反对以及美英两国在中东的矛盾进一步尖锐化，这个阴谋所面临的困难正在扩大。
    十月二十七、二十八日，美、英、法、土耳其四国曾先后“通知”叙利亚、黎巴嫩、伊拉克、沙特阿拉伯、外约旦和以色列等国政府，表示“打算不管埃及的行动，继续筹组中东防区”。十一月九日，四国再度“通知”中东各国政府，重申“打算继续进行在该地区建立联合司令部的计划”。十日，四国又发表成立“中东司令部”的所谓“原则”的声明，其中还特别提到：凡参加各国可望获得“发起国家”（主要指美国）在“军火和装备方面”的援助。与提出这些诱胁中东各国参加中东集团的外交声明的同时，美、英等国在阿拉伯各国的首都和正举行联合国第六届大会的巴黎，进行了紧张的外交活动。美国负责近东和非洲事务的副助理国务卿加德纳正在“周游”阿拉伯各国，据黎巴嫩“贝赖达报”说：加德纳此行的目的是为了与阿拉伯政治领袖们讨论中东军事集团计划。美国国会也有八个议员于十一月九日“访问”黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特。在巴黎，据合众社十三日电透露：“英国已结束了一系列的与在那里（出席联合国大会）的阿拉伯领袖的谈判”；阿拉伯各国代表目前正在巴黎举行阿拉伯联盟会议，讨论对“中东司令部”的态度问题。
    但是，美国进行这些活动的环境已越来越不利了。美国所遭到的障碍，首先就是从伊朗到摩洛哥整个阿拉伯和北非地区蓬蓬勃勃的民族解放运动。这一运动的矛头同样也直接针对着美国。因为中东各国人民不愿替美国人当炮灰，所以他们已日益有力地反对中东侵略集团的计划。美国斯克利浦斯—霍华德系报纸的评论家邓尼在十月十一日曾承认说：中东的“火焰正在逐渐不能控制。现在既然它们有破坏盟国中东防御（应读为侵略）体系之势，这已不复只是英国利益会受到什么损害的问题”。中东各国政府也对美国要它们火中取栗的政策表示怀疑与抗拒。合众社十月二十日从伦敦发出的电讯就曾困恼地说：整个回教世界的领袖们“已经表示赞成中立”。“纽约时报”驻中东记者也在最近写道：“主张建立一个中立的回教国家集团的意见很流行。”对于美、英、法、土四国的“通知”，沙特阿拉伯政府已答复四国说：“如果埃及的要求得不到满足，就不可能讨论四国关于中东共同防务的建议。”在这种形势下，即使中东各国统治集团内部一部分主张参加中东集团的人物也已难于一意孤行，叙利亚总理哈基姆由于公开主张参加“中东司令部”，已被迫在十日辞职。
    同时，美国拼凑中东集团除了为准备反苏战争之外，还有另外一个目的，就是要夺取英帝国主义在中东地区的统治地位，这已引起英国的严重不满，从而使英美两国的幕后争吵日趋激烈。法新社华盛顿十月七日电曾透露：华盛顿“消息灵通人士”公开认为，“英国已不再能保持它从前的大国地位了，美国应直接代替英国在中东的势力。”美国并企图利用中东的“反英情绪”，来达到它的目的。美国人出版的“中东杂志”最近即承认：美国和英国为了争取在中东的霸权，正实行着不同的政策，“只有在它们反对民族解放运动和共产主义两件事上是一致的”。
    在这种局面面前，美帝国主义虽然在积极进行其拼凑中东侵略集团的活动，但是却显然不能不感到前途的渺茫。合众社华盛顿十月十七日电就说：“美国急于要找出新策略来使西方国家保卫（应读为侵略）近东和中东多事地点的计划避免崩溃，但前途并不乐观。………在目前的气氛里，人民日益普遍认为美国将无法遏制危及西方防务计划（指中东侵略集团计划）的一连串的顽强行动。”
