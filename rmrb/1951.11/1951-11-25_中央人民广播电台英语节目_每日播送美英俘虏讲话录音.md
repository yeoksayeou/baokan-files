Xinhua News Agency, November 23rd: Starting from the 15th of this month, the English program of the Central People's Broadcasting Station will broadcast daily recordings of speeches made by American, British, and other prisoners of war to their families, as well as their singing, skits, and instrumental performances.

In order to enable the prisoners of war to report their safety to their families and have the opportunity to express their opinions on the Korean War, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression has specifically devised a method to use tape recorders in the Korean prisoner of war camps to record the prisoners' words and the dynamics of life in the camps, and entrusted the Central People's Broadcasting Station to broadcast them on the English program. In these recordings, the prisoners of war express their sincere gratitude for the lenient treatment they receive from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The prisoners of war have also filled in new lyrics to the tune of a popular American song, calling it "Withdraw from Korea!" They also sing "The East is Red" and "People of the World are of One Heart" in newly learned Chinese, and "General Kim Il-sung's Song" in Korean. Christmas is coming soon, and they are actively preparing for a celebration party. They have written some skits depicting life in the prisoner of war camp, as well as a large number of greetings to relatives and friends celebrating Christmas and the New Year. These many programs will be broadcast daily on the Central People's Broadcasting Station.

    每日播送美英俘虏讲话录音
    【新华社二十三日讯】中央人民广播电台英语节目，从本月十五日开始，每天播送美、英等国俘虏对他们家属的讲话和他们的歌唱、短剧、乐器演奏等录音。
    为了使俘虏们能够向他们的家属报告平安，和有机会发表对于朝鲜战争的意见，中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会特地设法在朝鲜俘虏营里用录音机把俘虏们讲的话和俘虏营的生活动态进行录音，并委托中央人民广播电台在英语节目中播送。在这些录音中，俘虏们对中国人民志愿军对他们的宽大待遇表示衷心的感激。俘虏们并用一支美国流行的通俗歌曲的调子，填上新的歌词，歌名叫“撤出朝鲜！”他们还用新学会的中国话唱“东方红”、“全世界人民心一条”，用朝鲜语唱“金日成将军之歌”。圣诞节不久将到来，他们正在积极筹备庆祝晚会，他们编写了一些描写俘虏营生活的短剧，还有大批向亲友们庆祝圣诞和新年的贺词。这许多节目，都将逐日在中央人民广播电台播送。
