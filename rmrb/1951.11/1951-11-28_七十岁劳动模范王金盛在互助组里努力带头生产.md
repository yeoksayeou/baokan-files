    Seventy-year-old Labor Model Wang Jinsheng Works Hard to Lead Production in the Mutual Aid Team
    I am Wang Jinsheng from Sanjiadian, Xinjiang County, Shanxi. I used to be a long-term farmhand for landlords all my life. It wasn't until the liberation of Xinjiang in 1946 that I was emancipated and received fourteen mu of land. My family has five people. My wife is blind, and my three grandchildren are all under ten years old. Although I am already seventy years old, I am in good health and can work harder in the mutual aid team than young people. In addition to farming every day, I also have to go home to cook and sew clothes, but that doesn't delay my work. This year, when delivering the summer public grain, I processed the wheat to be dry and white, and delivered it quickly. During the autumn tax collection, I picked and sorted the cotton two or three times, dried it until it was dry and white, and quickly delivered it, with the quality exceeding the standard. When the General Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea called for donations, I took the lead in donating two dou of wheat. I always think in my heart: the past days were worse than being a beast of burden, and now life is getting better day by day. I must rush to respond to all the government's calls. This autumn, during the production appraisal, I was elected as a labor model and went to the district for a meeting. The students even brought me flowers. I have lived for so many years and never enjoyed this glory. This is all thanks to the good leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. In the future, I must play a leading role in the mutual aid team. I must also actively promote the benefits of organizing and developing production to the masses.

    七十岁劳动模范王金盛在互助组里努力带头生产
    我是山西新绛县三家店人，过去一辈子给地主当长工，直到一九四六年新绛解放我才翻身，分得了十四亩地。我一家五口，老婆是瞎子，三个孙儿都还不满十岁。我虽然已经七十岁，但身体很好，在互助组里劳动比青年还能干。我每天除耕作外，还要回家烧饭缝补衣服，但那也误不了活。今年交夏季公粮时，我把麦子处理的又干又白，交的又快；秋征时，我把棉花挑检了两三遍，晒的又干又白，又很快交了上去，质量超过了标准化。在抗美援朝总会号召捐献时，我又带头捐了二斗麦。我心里老想着：过去的日子牛马不如，如今光景一天天好起来，我总要抢着响应政府一切号召。今年秋后评比生产，我被推选为劳动模范，并到区里开会，学生们还给我带花。我活了那么大年纪，从没享受过这份光荣。这都是毛主席和共产党领导得好，我今后在互助组里一定要起带头作用。还要积极向群众宣传组织起来发展生产的好处。
