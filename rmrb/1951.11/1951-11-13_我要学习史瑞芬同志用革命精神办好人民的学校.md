　　I Want to Learn from Comrade Shi Ruifen and Run People's Schools Well with Revolutionary Spirit
    Model teacher Comrade Shi Ruifen, in a difficult environment with severe famine, overcame difficulties, relied on the masses, disregarded personal gains and losses, and worked hard to run the school, eventually persevering in and developing Qingshuitang Elementary School. Her spirit of serving the people's education cause has set a good example for us.
    During this year's Teacher's Day, I was also selected as a second-class model teacher in Wenxi County, but compared with Comrade Shi Ruifen, my work achievements are far behind. I think the main reason for this is that I have not completely overcome the petty-bourgeois selfish and self-interested views and the fear of trouble, lack of a sense of ownership, and lack of Marxist-Leninist cultivation. Therefore, I still lack sufficient enthusiasm and a high sense of responsibility for my work. In the future, I will learn from Comrade Shi Ruifen, improve my political and theoretical level, eliminate the ideological consciousness of the petty bourgeoisie, wholeheartedly serve the people's education cause, and run the people's schools well with a revolutionary spirit.

　　我要学习史瑞芬同志用革命精神办好人民的学校
    模范教师史瑞芬同志，在灾荒严重的艰苦环境里，克服困难，依靠群众，不计个人得失，努力办学校，终于坚持和发展了清水塘小学。她为人民教育事业服务的精神，给我们树立了一个良好的榜样。
    在今年教师节，我也曾被选为闻喜县的二等教师模范，但和史瑞芬同志比较，我的工作成绩就差得很远。我想这主要的原因是我还没有完全克服小资产阶级自私自利的观点和怕麻烦的思想，缺乏主人翁感觉，缺乏马克思列宁主义的修养，因此对工作还缺乏足够的热情和高度的责任心。今后我要向史瑞芬同志学习，提高自己的政治理论水平，肃清小资产阶级的思想意识，全心全意为人民教育事业服务，用革命精神来办好人民的学校。
