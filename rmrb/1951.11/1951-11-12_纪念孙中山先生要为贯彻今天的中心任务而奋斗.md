　　Commemorating Mr. Sun Yat-sen: Striving to Fulfill Today's Central Task
　　Li Jishen
　　This year, November 12th, marks the 85th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth. We should express our sincere remembrance and high respect for this great revolutionary pioneer and his lifelong dedication to the cause of the Chinese revolution, his unyielding spirit, his continuous efforts, and his constant pursuit of progress. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary cause centered on anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism, especially in his later years, when he focused on the struggle against imperialism. In his Northern Expedition Declaration of 1924, he clearly pointed out: "The purpose of the National Revolution is to create an independent and free nation to uphold the interests of the nation and the people. This purpose is absolutely incompatible with the desire of imperialism to make China its colony forever." He also lodged a serious protest against the British navy's interference in China's revolutionary actions and issued a declaration to the outside world. In this declaration, he solemnly declared: "There was a period when we strived to overthrow the Qing Dynasty. Now, we will begin a period of striving to overthrow the interference of imperialism in China and eliminate the greatest obstacle to completing the work of revolutionary history." From these citations, we deeply understand that Mr. Sun was extremely indignant at the imperialists' aggression against China and repeatedly and solemnly stated that he would wage a firm and continuous struggle against the imperialists. The people of the whole country undoubtedly have an indelible impression, a correct understanding, and a high evaluation of Mr. Sun's great revolutionary cause of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism and his arduous, persevering, and unremitting revolutionary spirit, which has existed for many years up to the present day. The declaration of the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stated: "For more than a hundred years, the advanced elements of the Chinese people, among whom the outstanding one was the great revolutionary Sun Yat-sen, who led the Revolution of 1911, have led the broad masses of the people in a constant struggle to overthrow the oppression of imperialism and the Chinese reactionary government, overcoming all setbacks and continuing their efforts until they finally achieved their goal." This illustrates the Chinese people's support and praise for Mr. Sun's revolutionary cause, which is a reflection of the Chinese people's consistent and great common will to defend the motherland and oppose imperialist aggression.

　　The U.S. imperialists are now frantically and brutally attacking our neighbor, Korea, and brazenly occupying our territory of Taiwan, disregarding justice and righteousness. They also constantly violate our territorial waters and airspace, and wantonly kill and destroy the lives and property of our people. All of this is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. In the past year, we have given the U.S. imperialists a serious and fatal blow. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, fighting shoulder to shoulder in the face of ferocious enemies, have demonstrated an unparalleled heroic revolutionary spirit and fighting power, driving the U.S. imperialists and their accomplice countries' troops from the Yalu River back to the vicinity of the 38th parallel, the starting point of their war of aggression. This great victory is an unprecedented victory in the history of China's century-long anti-imperialist struggle. It is a great victory of the Chinese people's will and strength manifested under the education of Mao Zedong Thought. It is a great victory of the revolutionary movement of patriotism and internationalism combined, launched by the people of China and Korea in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. As we commemorate the birth of the great revolutionary Sun Yat-sen today, recalling Mr. Sun's decades of arduous struggle against the imperialists and the fighting slogan of "Peace, Struggle, Save China" that he put forward on his deathbed, as well as the fighting strategy he emphasized in his will: "We must awaken the masses and unite with those nations in the world that treat us as equals to fight together," and the firm conviction and correct revolutionary line he pointed out when reorganizing the Kuomintang in 1924: "Our party's future revolution will not be achieved without taking Russia as our teacher," we are all the more convinced that the current great victory in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea is due to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, and due to the brotherly enthusiasm, encouragement, and support of our great ally, the Soviet Union, and the democratic countries. Only under such superior conditions can we win today's victory and consolidate this victory, and can we strive for more, greater, and complete victories in the future.

　　Chairman Mao said in his opening address at the Third Plenary Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "The great struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea is still going on and must continue until the U.S. government is willing to resolve it peacefully. ... In order to continue to uphold this necessary and just struggle, we need to continue to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, we need to increase production and practice thrift to support the Chinese People's Volunteers. This is the central task of the Chinese people today..." The central task of the Chinese people today has been clearly indicated. The Third Plenary Session of the National Committee, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, adopted the following three resolutions: (1) Continue to strengthen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea; (2) Promote and promote the patriotic movement to increase production and practice economy; (3) Promote the ideological remolding movement, and systematically organize the study movement of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, which is the combination of Chinese revolutionary practice. But how should we unite and rise up to implement this great central task? As the vanguard of the democratic class, the democratic parties must naturally play a leading role. First of all, they must educate their own members and the masses they are in contact with to have a correct and profound understanding of the necessity, justice, and purpose of this great movement. Then, they must vigorously publicize it to the broad masses of the people, and encourage, plan, and participate in the leadership of all practical actions. The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, as a member of the people's democratic united front, should solemnly express to the people of the whole country that we wholeheartedly support Chairman Mao's opening address at the Third Plenary Session of the First National Committee and will call on all members of the Revolutionary Committee to fight to the end to implement the "central task of the Chinese people today" as instructed by him.

　　We deeply realize that in the two years since the founding of the new People's Republic of China, construction in all aspects has progressed so rapidly; all ethnic groups, democratic classes, democratic parties, and democratic figures in the country are so unprecedentedly united, which proves that our people's democratic dictatorship system has great superiority over the political system of capitalist countries. On the basis of this system, the people of the whole country can exert endless power. This power cannot be defeated by any enemy. But everyone understands that the emergence of the people's democratic dictatorship system, that is, the concrete manifestation of Mao Zedong Thought, is also the great victory achieved by Mao Zedong Thought in Chinese revolutionary practice. If we want to continue to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea today, we must first strengthen the study of Mao Zedong Thought among the people of the whole country. Only when everyone learns Mao Zedong Thought and grasps this ideological weapon can they unite and progress, and can they place the interests of the country and the interests of the revolution above everything else. As long as it is considered beneficial to the motherland, to the people, and to the revolutionary cause, individuals are willing to sacrifice everything. This is the great, heroic, and lofty performance of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front today in order to defend the motherland and to defend world peace and human security. Marx said: "Theory, once it has mastered the masses, immediately becomes a material force." Let Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought arm the people of the whole country and become the source of all power in the new China. The great revolutionary pioneer Sun Yat-sen, after the success of the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, began to discover the truth of Marxism-Leninism and the new brilliance and great power it exerted in the modern world revolutionary movement. Therefore, he clearly and firmly put forward the revolutionary proposition of "taking Russia as a teacher" and adhered to his new view and new revolutionary line at that time. As we commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit of taking Russia as our teacher at that time, we should more deeply understand Chairman Mao's "leaning to one side" policy today, and learn from Mr. Sun's revolutionary spirit of constantly pursuing progress. We must study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in order to realize his great legacy of anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle, and thoroughly defeat and eliminate the most ferocious enemy of imperialism today—the U.S. imperialist aggressive forces in China and the Far East.

　　In the past year, in order to support the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the people of the whole country have launched an extremely large-scale patriotic movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea throughout the country. According to Comrade Peng Zhen's report, 70 to 80 percent of the population of the country has participated in the patriotic actions of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and has received patriotic education in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. Around May Day this year, a total of 229.99 million people across the country participated in demonstrations and parades to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, oppose the arming of Japan, and defend world peace. From April to July this year, the number of people who voted against the U.S. arming of Japan was more than 339.9 million, and the number of people who signed the request to conclude a peace treaty among the five major powers was more than 344.4 million. In addition, in order to support the front line, the people of the whole country launched a campaign to increase production and donate money, and as of October 18, in just four and a half months, they donated money equivalent to 2,618 fighter planes, that is, 392.7 billion yuan. During this period, in order to defend our great motherland and build a strong modern national defense force, a total of 580,000 young students and young workers across the country volunteered to apply to participate in various military cadre schools. All of this fully demonstrates the great and firm will and strength of the Chinese people in supporting the front line and combating the war of U.S. imperialism. In the future, as long as we follow Chairman Mao's instructions and continue to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, mainly increasing production and practicing thrift, we believe that we will definitely be able to exert endless power to support our volunteers. In the near future, a very large-scale patriotic movement to increase production and practice thrift will be launched throughout the country. From general cities to vast rural areas, from organs and groups to individual families, there is increased production everywhere, and everyone is saving. Due to this vigorous new atmosphere and practical new style, we will definitely be able to achieve inestimable new achievements. And our new and incomparably powerful force will not only completely destroy the aggressive forces of U.S. imperialism, but also the construction of our country in all aspects, especially the construction of national defense and important economic construction, will also be greatly advanced and rapidly move towards a bright future as a result of the implementation of this great movement.

　　Now, on the occasion of the 85th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth, in order to remember and admire this great revolutionary pioneer's revolutionary cause and revolutionary spirit of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism, in order to support and carry forward his correct revolutionary policies and revolutionary propositions of "taking Russia as a teacher" and opposing imperialism in the Soviet Union; the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang must call on all party members and the masses they are in contact with, together with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, to resolutely implement the major resolutions unanimously agreed upon and passed by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, and will cooperate with the democratic parties of China and all patriotic and democratic people to closely plan and focus on carrying out the following three aspects of work: (1) The work of continuing to strengthen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea; (2) The work of advocating and promoting the patriotic movement to increase production and practice thrift; (3) The work of promoting the ideological remolding movement, and systematically organizing the study movement of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, which is the combination of Chinese revolutionary practice. We believe that due to the planned, step-by-step, universal, and in-depth implementation of the above three major movements, the Chinese people will definitely be able to exert endless power to support the front line in order to win the victory in the Korean War, to ensure the victory of the motherland's peaceful construction cause, and to defend the great victory of the cause of peace and democracy in the Far East and the world.

　　Finally, let us shout:
　　The revolutionary spirit of the great revolutionary pioneer Sun Yat-sen is immortal!
　　Long live the victory of the great people's leader Mao Zedong Thought!
　　Long live the consolidation and unity of the friendship between the two great allies of China and the Soviet Union!
　　Long live the great unity of the people of the world!

　　纪念孙中山先生要为贯彻今天的中心任务而奋斗
    李济深
    本年十一月十二日为孙中山先生八十五周年诞辰纪念日，我们对于这一伟大的革命先行者和他毕生尽瘁于中国革命事业，不屈不挠、再接再厉以及不断追求进步的革命精神，应表示诚挚的追思和崇高的敬意。孙中山先生的革命事业，就是以反帝国主义反封建为中心任务，特别是到了晚年，尤着重于对帝国主义的斗争。他在一九二四年北上宣言里明确地指出：“国民革命之目的，在造成独立自由之国家，以拥护国家及民众之利益，此种目的，与帝国主义欲使中国永为其殖民地者，绝对不能相容。”并为英国海军干涉中国的革命行动，曾提出一个严重的抗议，并对外发表宣言，在这宣言里，他郑重地宣称：“从前有一个时期，为努力推翻满清，今将开始一时期，为努力推翻帝国主义之干涉中国，扫除完成革命历史的工作之最大障碍。”从这些引证中，我们深切地了解到，孙先生对于帝国主义者之侵略中国，是极端愤慨的，并一再严正地表示，必将与帝国主义者作坚决不断的奋斗。全国人民无疑地对于先生所进行的反帝反封建的伟大革命事业，及其艰苦卓绝奋斗不懈的革命精神，多年来以至今日还存在着不可磨灭的印象，正确的认识和崇高的评价。中国人民政协第一届全体会议的宣言中说：“一百多年以来，中国人民的先进分子，其中杰出者有如领导辛亥革命的伟大革命家孙中山先生，为了推翻帝国主义和中国反动政府的压迫，领导广大的人民，进行了不断的斗争，百折不挠，再接再厉，到现在，终于达到了目的。”这说明了中国人民对于孙先生革命事业的拥护和赞誉，也就是中国人民保卫祖国和反对帝国主义侵略一贯的共同的伟大意志的反映。
    美帝国主义者，现在正在疯狂残暴地攻打我们的邻邦朝鲜，不顾公理正义横行霸道地侵占我国的领土台湾，以及经常不断地侵犯我国领海领空，并无端杀害和破坏我国人民的生命财产，这一切都是中国人民绝对不能容忍的。一年以来，我们给了美帝国主义者一个严重而致命的打击。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，在凶恶的敌人面前，肩比肩地作战，表现了无比英勇的革命精神和战斗力量，把美帝国主义及其帮凶国家的部队，从鸭绿江边，赶回到他们发动侵略战争的起点，即三八线附近一带。这一伟大胜利，是中国百年反帝斗争史上空前的胜利，是中国人民在毛泽东思想教育下所表现的意志和力量的巨大胜利，是中朝两国人民在以苏联为首的和平民主阵营里所展开的爱国主义与国际主义相结合的革命运动的伟大胜利。我们在今日纪念伟大的革命家孙中山先生诞辰的时候，回想到孙先生几十年和帝国主义者苦战苦斗的精神和他在临终时所提出的“和平、奋斗、救中国”的战斗口号，在遗嘱里所强调的：“必须唤起民众，及联合世界上以平等待我之民族，共同奋斗”的战斗策略，以及他在一九二四年改组中国国民党时所指出的“我党今后之革命，非以俄为师，断无成就”的坚决主张和正确的革命路线，我们益感到当前抗美援朝伟大胜利的获得，是由于有了毛主席和中国共产党的英明领导，由于有了伟大的盟邦苏联和各民主主义国家兄弟般的热情鼓舞和支援。只有在这样优越条件下，我们才能赢得今日的胜利和巩固这胜利，并能争取今后更多更大的完全的胜利。
    毛主席在人民政协全国委员会第一届第三次全体会议开会词中说：“抗美援朝的伟大斗争现在还在继续进行，并且必须继续进行到美国政府愿意和平解决的时候为止。……为了继续坚持这个必要的正义的斗争，我们就需要继续加强抗美援朝的工作，需要增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军。这是中国人民今天的中心任务……。”中国人民今天的中心任务已经明确地指示出来了。全国委员会第三次会议并依照毛主席的指示，通过了下列三项决议：（一）继续加强抗美援朝运动；（二）提倡和推动爱国增产节约运动；（三）推动思想改造运动，有系统地组织对于马克思列宁主义与中国革命实践相结合毛泽东思想的学习运动。但我们应如何一致奋起，来贯彻这一伟大的中心任务呢？作为民主阶级先锋队的民主党派，自然是要起带头和领导作用，首先是教育自己的党员及所联系的群众，对于这一伟大运动的必要性、正义性及其目的性，要有一个正确而深刻的认识，然后向广大人民大力进行宣传，并作一切实际行动的鼓舞、策划和参加领导。中国国民党革命委员会是人民民主统一战线的一员，应向全国人民郑重地表示，我们是竭诚拥护毛主席在第一届全国委员会第三次会议的开会词，并将号召民革全体党员为贯彻他所指示的“中国人民今天的中心任务”而奋斗到底。
    我们深刻地体会到，新生的中华人民共和国，在成立后的两年中，各方面的建设，是如此地突飞猛进；全国各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派，以及各界民主人士，是如此空前地巩固团结，这都证明了我们的人民民主专政制度，较之资本主义国家的政治制度具有极大的优越性。在这种制度的基础上，全国人民才能发挥无穷无尽的力量。这种力量，是任何敌人所不能战胜的。但大家都明白，人民民主专政制度的产生，即毛泽东思想的具体表现，亦即毛泽东思想在中国革命实践中所获得的伟大胜利。我们今日需要继续加强抗美援朝的工作，首先就要加强全国人民对于毛泽东思想的学习，人人学会了毛泽东思想并掌握了这个思想武器，才能团结进步，才能把国家利益和革命利益置于一切之上，只要认为对祖国、对人民、对革命事业，是有好处，个人情愿牺牲一切，这就是中国人民志愿军今日在朝鲜前线，为了保卫祖国，为了保卫世界和平与人类安全，所作的伟大的英勇的和崇高的表现。马克思说：“理论一掌握了群众，便立刻成为物质的力量”。让马列主义和毛泽东思想，把全国人民武装起来，变为新中国一切力量的泉源。伟大的革命先行者孙中山先生，在苏联十月革命成功后，即开始发见马列主义的真理，在现代世界革命运动中所发挥的新的光辉与伟大的力量，所以他明确而坚定地提出“以俄为师”的革命主张和坚持他当时这个新的看法、新的革命路线。我们纪念孙中山先生当时这种以俄为师的精神，就该更深切领会今日毛主席“一边倒”的政策，而学习孙先生不断追求进步的革命精神，一定要学习马列主义和毛泽东思想，以实现他反帝反封建斗争的伟大遗志，把今日帝国主义中最凶恶的敌人——美帝国主义在中国在远东的侵略势力，彻底地打垮和肃清。
    在过去一年中，全国人民为了支援抗美援朝的斗争，是在全国范围内，展开了一个极大规模的抗美援朝爱国运动。根据彭真同志的报告，全国已经有百分之七十至八十的人口，参加抗美援朝的爱国行动，受到了抗美援朝的爱国教育。今年五一劳动节前后，全国共有二亿二千九百九十余万人参加了抗美援朝，反对武装日本，保卫世界和平的示威游行。今年四月到七月，投票反对美国武装日本的人数，有三亿三千九百九十万人以上，签名要求缔结五大国和平公约的人数，有三亿四千四百余万人。又全国人民为了支援前线，自本年七月起，开展了增产捐献运动，截至十月十八日止，仅仅四个半月的时间，就捐献了相当于二千六百十八架战斗机的金钱，即三万九千二百七十亿元。在这期间，为了保卫我们伟大的祖国，建设强大的现代化的国防军，全国共有五十八万青年学生和青年工人，志愿报名参加各种军事干部学校。所有这些，都充分表现了中国人民，在支援前线，打击美帝国主义战争中伟大而坚决的意志和力量。今后只要遵照毛主席的指示，继续加强抗美援朝工作，主要的是增加生产，厉行节约，我们相信一定更能发挥无穷无尽的力量，来支援我们的志愿军。最近的将来，在全国范围内，是要展开一个极大规模的爱国增产节约运动。从一般城市到广大农村，从机关团体到个别家庭，处处有增产，人人在节约，由于有了这种蓬蓬勃勃的新气象和切切实实的新作风，我们一定能够获得不可估计的新成绩。而我们新生的强大无比的力量，不只是把美帝国主义的侵略势力，彻底予以摧毁；就是我们国家各方面的建设，特别是国防建设和重要的经济建设，也由于这一伟大运动推行的结果，要展开大步朝向光明前途而迅速迈进了。
    兹当孙中山先生八十五周年诞辰纪念日，为了追思和崇敬这一伟大革命先行者平生反帝反封建的革命事业与革命精神，为了拥护和发扬他“以俄为师”和苏联反帝的正确的革命政策与革命主张；中国国民党革命委员会一定要号召全党党员及所联系的群众和全国人民一道在毛主席和中国共产党领导之下，坚决执行这次人民政协全国委员会议依据毛主席的指示，一致同意所通过的重大的决议，并将配合中国各民主党派及一切爱国民主人士，严密地计划，着重地进行下列三方面工作：（一）关于继续加强抗美援朝运动的工作；（二）关于提倡和推动爱国增产节约运动的工作；（三）关于推动思想改造运动的工作，有系统地组织对于马克思、列宁主义与中国革命实践相结合的毛泽东思想的学习运动。我们相信由于以上三大运动有计划有步骤地普遍而深入地推行，中国人民一定更能发挥无穷无尽的力量，支援前线，以争取朝鲜战争的胜利；以保证祖国和平建设事业的胜利，以保卫远东及全世界国家和平民主事业的伟大胜利。
    最后让我们高呼：
    伟大的革命先行者孙中山先生的革命精神不朽！
    伟大的人民领袖毛泽东思想胜利万岁！
    中苏两大盟国的友谊巩固团结万岁！
    全世界人民大团结万岁！
