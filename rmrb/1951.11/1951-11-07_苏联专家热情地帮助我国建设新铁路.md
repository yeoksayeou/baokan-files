    Soviet experts enthusiastically help our country build new railways
    Soviet experts, who have made great contributions to the rapid restoration of our country's railways, continue to help our country build new railway lines.
    Soviet experts pay great attention to the quality of engineering when helping our country build new railways. The construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway adopted the suggestions of Soviet experts to first complete the drainage works and then lay the roadbed; when repairing the roadbed, the earth was compacted every three Chinese inches of filling. This has made the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway one of the most stable railways in our country. The section of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway that has been opened to traffic has not had a single railway operation accident since it was opened.
    Not only ensuring high engineering quality, Soviet experts also help us to build railways as quickly as possible. For example, when building the Tuojiang River Bridge on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the speed of the project increased several times after accepting the opinions of Soviet experts. The Yongjiang River Bridge on the Laibin-Zhennanguan Railway (from Laibin to Zhennanguan), after on-site research and guidance from Soviet experts, was built faster, stronger, and more economically than the original design, which greatly contributed to the early opening of the Laibin-Zhennanguan Railway.
    Soviet experts also use their advanced experience to help us avoid waste and save national funds based on the actual conditions of each line. For example, the line between Daliangying and Shuijiapo on the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway saved 38 million catties of millet compared to the original plan based on the suggestions of Soviet experts.
    In the construction of new lines, Soviet experts not only provided us with great technical assistance, but also cared about the safety of Chinese workers at all times and places. This is of great educational significance for on-site management personnel. Once, a Soviet expert inspected the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway and saw many workers digging soil on a hillside, with some workers standing on the frozen soil layer to dig and others standing below the frozen soil layer to dig. He immediately told the management personnel that they should stop work immediately. He said that it was a criminal act to allow workers to work on a frozen soil layer that could collapse at any time. He suggested using other methods to dig soil. Another time, a Soviet expert walked past a cave and was surprised to see a pile of explosives placed at the entrance of the cave. He said to the management personnel that if someone threw down a match, the workers working in the cave would be injured. He suggested that the explosives should be placed further away from the cave, and that people should only be sent into the cave to detonate the explosives after the workers had completely left the cave.

    苏联专家热情地帮助我国建设新铁路
    对我国铁路的迅速恢复有巨大贡献的苏联专家，继续帮助我国建设铁路新线路。
    苏联专家在帮助我国建设新铁路时非常注重工程的质量。成渝铁路的修筑，就曾采用了苏联专家的建议，先做好排水工程，然后铺路基；修路基时每填土三公寸打夯一次。这样，就使成渝路成为我国最稳固的铁路之一。成渝路已通车的部分从通车到现在一次工务事故也没发生过。
    不仅保证工程质量很高，苏联专家还帮助我们尽量使铁路修得快。如修筑成渝路上的沱江桥时，因接受了苏联专家的意见，工程进行的速度快了好几倍。来镇铁路（来宾到镇南关）上的邕江大桥，经过苏联专家实地研究指导，比原来的设计修得又快又牢固还省钱，对来镇路的提前通车起了很大作用。
    苏联专家还根据每一处线路的实际情况，用他们的先进经验帮助我们避免浪费，节省国家资金。如天兰铁路上大梁营到水家坡间的线路，根据苏联专家的建议，比原来计划节省三千八百万斤小米。
    在修建新线路中，苏联专家不但在技术上给了我们很大帮助，而且随时随地关心着中国工人的安全。这对于现场管理人员有很大教育意义。有一次苏联专家到天兰线巡视，看到许多工人在一个山坡上挖土，一部分工人站在冰土层上挖，另一部分站在冰土层下面挖。他立刻告诉管理人员应该马上停止工作。他说，让工人在随时有塌倒可能的冰土层上工作简直是犯罪行为。他建议改用别的办法挖土。又一次，苏联专家走过一个山洞，看见洞口放着一堆炸药，大吃一惊。他对管理人员说，万一有人扔下一根火柴头，洞里正在工作的工人们就会受到伤害。他建议炸药要放得离洞远一些，而且一定要等到工人们完全离开山洞以后，再派人进洞放炸药。（新华社）
