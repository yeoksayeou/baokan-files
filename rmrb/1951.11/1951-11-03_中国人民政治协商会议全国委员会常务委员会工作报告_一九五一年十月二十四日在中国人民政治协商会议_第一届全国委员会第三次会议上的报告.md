Chairman Chen, fellow committee members, comrades:

	Over the past year, our country has launched three large-scale movements, achieving brilliant successes and developments in political, defense, economic, and cultural construction. During this period, the Standing Committee, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, has done what it should. Here is a brief report to the conference for your examination.

	I. Initiated and promoted the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, which has great international significance in safeguarding national security and defending peace in the East. When American imperialism followed in the footsteps of Japanese imperialism, launching a war of aggression in Korea, occupying our territory of Taiwan, and reaching our northeastern border, it aroused a wave of resistance to America and aid to Korea among people of all strata across the country. Based on the will and demands of the broad masses of the people, the Standing Committee invited democratic parties to consult. After careful consultation, the democratic parties issued the famous "Joint Declaration of Democratic Parties" on November 4, 1950. After the joint declaration was issued, the Standing Committee consulted with democratic parties, people's organizations, and democratic figures to strengthen the organization of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, i.e., the General Association for Resist America, Aid Korea, to unify the leadership of the movement. It also mobilized all parties to participate in various activities of resisting America and aiding Korea through democratic parties, people's organizations, and local committees (provincial and municipal consultative committees). Since then, the ranks of the Chinese People's Volunteers have continued to expand, and they have successively gone to the Korean front to conduct a victorious anti-aggression war alongside the Korean People's Army. The domestic movement to resist America and aid Korea has been more widely launched, spreading to all nationalities and all strata of the people. On the sixth anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the association re-issued a declaration jointly with the democratic parties, calling on the people of the whole country to do their utmost and work with the Korean people to strive for a victorious end to the Korean anti-aggression war through long-term struggle. The people of the whole country have warmly responded to this call with various practical actions.

	II. Assisted the government in carrying out land reform for hundreds of millions of people. After the Land Reform Law was passed by the Second Session of this conference and promulgated and implemented by the Central People's Government, the Standing Committee immediately passed the Organizational Rules for Peasant Associations, the Organizational Rules for People's Courts, and the Decision on the Division of Rural Class Components, and suggested that the Central People's Government adopt and implement them. In addition, the Committee has worked with relevant agencies to absorb a large number of people from democratic parties, people's organizations, government agencies, universities, and other social figures in Beijing and Tianjin to participate in or visit land reform in various regions, reaching 1,815 people so far; it is expected that a large number of people can still be absorbed to participate in this work. The local committees, with reference to the methods of the National Committee, have also carried out the same work. According to the experience already gained, this is indeed of great benefit to the progress of land reform, especially to the learning of the participants.

	III. Assisted the government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries to implement the provisions of Article 7 of the Common Program. The Standing Committee participated in the consultation and formulation of the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries," and carried out publicity work and participated in actual struggles through democratic parties, people's organizations, and local committees. From the central government to the local levels, the responsible persons of democratic parties and people's organizations, as well as democratic figures from all walks of life, have participated in the review and trial of counter-revolutionary cases.

	Due to the concerted efforts of the democratic parties, people's organizations, democratic figures from all walks of life, and the people of the whole country united under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the above three major movements have provided our country with immeasurable gains and extremely valuable experience. However, the Standing Committee's work report does not intend to involve the summary of the three major movements (Vice Chairman Peng Zhen of the General Association for Resist America, Aid Korea has been invited to make a special report on the Resist America, Aid Korea movement).

	IV. Passed and issued slogans for celebrating the May 1st Labor Day and slogans for celebrating the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

	V. Another important task of the Standing Committee was to convene a meeting of secretaries-general of provincial and municipal consultative committees, to make a general summary of the work experience of the provincial and municipal consultative committees, to make a concrete analysis of the nature and role of the consultative organs and their relationship with all parties, and on this basis, to make necessary regulations or supplements to the working principles and mutual relations of the consultative organs at all levels. The relevant documents have been published separately by this conference and the Central People's Government, and there is no need to cite and explain them again. The implementation of these documents will definitely be conducive to the progress of the work of the consultative committees at all levels and the standing committees of counties. In addition, we have published irregular newsletters to exchange experience. The connection between the National Committee and the consultative organs at all levels is also gradually increasing.

	VI. The daily work of the Standing Committee is carried out through working meetings. The working meeting is composed of the secretary-general, deputy secretaries-general, group leaders, standing staff of the study seminar, directors and deputy directors of the secretariat, and other relevant full-time responsible persons, with the secretary-general responsible for presiding. The activities of the groups, the work of receiving and handling people's opinions, the bi-weekly symposium (organized by representatives of democratic parties and people's organizations, mainly to discuss current political and major policy issues) and the study symposium (voluntarily formed by senior personnel of democratic parties, people's organizations, and government agencies), and the joint study activities of the staff of the democratic parties' agencies are all planned and carried out by the working meeting. Regarding the common activities between the democratic parties, people's organizations, and democratic figures, those that do not need to be directly handled by the chairman or the Standing Committee are generally handled by the working meeting inviting representatives of the relevant parties to negotiate, and the important ones are reported to the chairman or the Standing Committee for approval. There is no need to enumerate the examples of work in these areas. In order to meet the needs of the democratic parties to develop their organizations, the working meeting proposed to exchange opinions and experiences on developing organizations at the bi-weekly symposium, and assisted the headquarters of the democratic parties in solving the problems of staffing, funding, and cadre training for full-time personnel at all levels. This year, all democratic parties have developed, and the hope of doubling the number can generally be realized, and some have already exceeded it. The working meeting has fulfilled its considerable responsibility for contacting and communicating with relevant units and for establishing the daily work of the association. However, there are still shortcomings, manifested in: too little contact with the members stationed in various places, lack of regular contact with the local committees, and the work of the groups is mostly biased towards assisting the government in reviewing bills. The working meeting has reviewed and paid attention to these issues and will improve in the future.

	The above is a brief report on the work of the Standing Committee after the Second Session of this conference.

    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员会工作报告
    ——一九五一年十月二十四日在中国人民政治协商会议
    第一届全国委员会第三次会议上的报告
    陈叔通主席、各位委员，各位同志：
    一年以来，我们国家展开了规模广大的三大运动，在政治、国防、经济和文化各方面的建设上都获得辉煌的成就与发展。在此期间，常务委员会在毛主席领导下，曾经作了它应当作的事情，这里向大会提出简要的报告，请加审察。
    一、发起了和推动了在保卫祖国安全、保卫东方和平事业上有伟大国际意义的抗美援朝运动。当美帝国主义蹈袭日本帝国主义的故技，在朝鲜发动了侵略战争，侵占了我国领土台湾，并打到了我国东北边疆的时候，在全国各阶层人民中激起了抗美援朝的浪潮。常务委员会依据广大人民的意志和要求，邀请各民主党派协商，各民主党派经过慎重协商之后，于一九五零年十一月四日发布了有名的
    “各民主党派联合宣言”。在联合宣言发布之后，常务委员会即与各民主党派、各人民团体和民主人士协商，加强中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会即抗美援朝总会的组织，使运动获得统一的领导；又曾经过各民主党派、各人民团体及各地方委员会（省、市协商委员会），动员各方面参加抗美援朝的各种活动。自此以后，中国人民志愿军的队伍日益扩大，并陆续开赴朝鲜前线与朝鲜人民军并肩进行胜利的反侵略战争；国内抗美援朝运动更加广泛展开，普及到一切民族和一切阶层的人民。抗日战争胜利日六周年，本会复与各民主党派联名发布宣言，号召全国人民竭尽全力，和朝鲜人民一道，用长期的奋斗来争取朝鲜反侵略战争的胜利结束。全国人民已经以各种实际行动，热烈地响应了这个号召。
    二、协助政府进行数万万人民的土地改革。本会第二次会议通过土地改革法并经中央人民政府公布施行后，常务委员会旋即通过农民协会组织通则、人民法庭组织通则及关于划分农村阶级成分的决定，建议中央人民政府采择施行。此外，曾会同有关机关自北京、天津两地各民主党派、人民团体、政府机关、大学校及其他社会人士中，吸收大批人员到各地区参加或参观土地改革，迄今已达一千八百十五人；预计尚可吸收大批的人士前往参加此项工作。各地方委员会参照全国委员会的办法，亦曾进行了同样的工作。据已经取得的经验，这对于土地改革的进行，尤其对于参加人员的学习，确有极大的好处。
    三、协助政府镇压反革命，以贯彻共同纲领第七条的规定。常务委员会曾参加了“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”的协商和制定，并经过各民主党派、人民团体和地方委员会进行宣传工作，参加实际斗争。自中央至各地方，各民主党派和人民团体的负责人以及各界民主人士，多参加了反革命案件的审查和审判工作。
    由于各民主党派、各人民团体、各界民主人士和全国人民一致团结在毛主席领导之下的共同努力，上述的三大运动给我们国家提供了无法计量的收获，并提供了极为宝贵的经验。但在常务委员会的工作报告中，不拟涉及三大运动的总结（其中抗美援朝运动已请抗美援朝总会彭真副主席作专题报告）。
    四、通过和发布了庆祝五一劳动节的口号，庆祝中华人民共和国成立两周年的口号。
    五、常务委员会的另一件重要工作，就是召开全国省、市协商委员会秘书长会议，给各省、市协商委员会的工作经验作了一般的总结，给协商机关的性质、作用及其与各方面的关系作了具体的分析，在此基础之上，对各级协商机关的工作方针及其相互关系，作了必要的规定或补充。其有关文件，业经本会和中央人民政府分别公布，无需再加引证和说明。这些文件的实施，一定有利于各级协商委员会和县常务委员会工作的进展。此外，我们已经出版不定期的会刊，以便交流经验。全国委员会与各级协商机关的联系，也在逐渐增多起来。
    六、常务委员会的日常工作，是经过工作会议来进行的。工作会议由秘书长、副秘书长、各组组长、学习座谈会干事会常务干事、秘书处处长副处长及其他有关专职负责人员组成，秘书长负主持之责。关于各组的工作，关于接受和处理人民意见的工作，关于双周座谈会（由各民主党派和人民团体的代表组织，以座谈时事政治和重大政策问题为主）和学习座谈会（各民主党派、人民团体和政府机关的高级人员所自愿组成）的活动，关于各民主党派机关工作人员的共同学习活动，均经由工作会议负责计划进行。关于各民主党派、人民团体和民主人士之间的共同性活动，凡不需由主席或常务委员会直接处理者，一般均经由工作会议邀请有关方面的代表协商处理，其重要者报请主席或常务委员会核定。这些方面的工作实例，不必枚举。工作会议为适应各民主党派发展组织的需要，曾提议在双周座谈会上交换发展组织的意见和经验，曾协助各民主党派总部解决各级专任人员的编制、经费供给以及干部训练等问题。今年各民主党派都有了发展，发展一倍的希望，一般可以实现，个别的已经超过了。工作会议对于联系和沟通各有关单位，对于建立本会的日常工作，是尽了相当责任的。但还有缺点，表现在：与驻在各地的委员联系太少，与地方委员会的关系缺乏经常性，各组的工作也多偏于协助政府审查法案的一个方面。工作会议已经检讨并注意这些问题，今后会有改进的。
    以上就是本会第二次会议后常务委员会工作的简要报告。
