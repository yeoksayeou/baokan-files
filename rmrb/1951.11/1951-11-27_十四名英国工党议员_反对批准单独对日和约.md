Xinhua News Agency, London, November 26th (TASS dispatch): According to newspaper reports, the British Churchill government will submit a bill to the House of Commons on the 26th regarding the ratification of the separate peace treaty with Japan. On the 22nd, fourteen Labour MPs, including Schmith, Davis, and Mrs. Castle, jointly submitted a motion in the House of Commons protesting this bill. The political correspondent for the "Manchester Guardian" said that these Labour MPs proposed an outright rejection of the bill. The correspondent reported that before the meeting of the House of Commons, the Labour Party parliamentary group would hold a meeting where Labour leaders would exert pressure on Labour MPs to prevent them from forcing a vote on their motion. The reporter also said: "The reasons for Labour MPs' opposition to this bill are very complex, including economic reasons and political reasons. Many MPs on both sides of the House of Commons representing cotton textile regions are concerned about future Japanese competition in the textile industry."
     The "Worker's Daily" political correspondent said: "Many Labour MPs are firmly opposed to the peace treaty with Japan, believing it to be a threat to world peace and a threat to the British economy. This treaty allows the United States to effectively control Japan, rearm Japan, and revive Japanese competition with British goods in the world market."

    十四名英国工党议员
    反对批准单独对日和约
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社伦敦讯：据报纸消息，英国邱吉尔政府将在二十六日向下院提出关于批准单独对日和约的法案。二十二日，施米斯、戴维斯、克斯尔夫人等十四名工党议员，在下院联合提出动议，抗议这个法案。“曼彻斯特卫报”政治记者说：这些工党议员提议断然否决这个法案。该记者报道：在下院开会前，工党议会党团举行会议时，工党领袖将对工党议员使用压力，防止他们强求表决他们的动议。记者又说：“工党议员反对此项法案的原因是很复杂的，有经济上的原因，也有政治上的原因。代表棉纺业地区的下院双方许多议员，都忧虑日本将来在纺织业方面的竞争。”
     “工人日报”政治记者说：“许多工党议员都坚决反对对日和约，认为它是对世界和平的威胁，对英国经济的威胁。这个和约使得美国实际上控制了日本，让日本重新武装，并复活日本在世界市场上和英国货物的竞争。”
