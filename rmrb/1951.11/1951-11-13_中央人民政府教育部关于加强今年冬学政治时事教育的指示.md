　　Instructions from the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government on Strengthening Political and Current Affairs Education in This Year's Winter School

　　Most major administrative regions across the country have issued instructions and made arrangements for this year's winter school movement. Chairman Mao recently instructed us at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: to continue strengthening the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, increasing production and practicing thrift to support the Chinese People's Volunteers, which is the central task of the Chinese people today. Winter school is a powerful weapon for educating and organizing the broad masses of peasants. We should fully utilize this weapon, in coordination with other work, to achieve the above-mentioned central task. For this purpose, the following instructions are given:

　　1. This year, winter schools in all parts of the country should universally and deeply conduct patriotic education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea among the peasant masses, promote the movement to increase production and practice thrift and the patriotic pact movement, and, in conjunction to local conditions, conduct policy education on land reform, democratic reform, mutual aid in production, and the marriage laws. This is the primary task of this year's winter school movement. The content of winter school cultural learning should be combined with political education as much as possible. Localities should prevent and correct the tendency to emphasize cultural learning in isolation and neglect political and current affairs education.

　　2. In order to successfully complete this task, leading organs in various localities should organize forces from all aspects to divide the work and cooperate under a unified plan to carry out this work. Counties, districts, and villages should organize peasant spare-time education committees or winter school movement committees with dedicated personnel in charge, mobilize and organize qualified district and village cadres, cadres of resident organs, propagandists, and primary school teachers with higher political levels to serve as political instructors for winter schools, and have them give lectures or classes. Political instructors should be trained in short-term training sessions, centered at the county level, to instruct the key points of educational content and teaching methods.

　　3. For this year's winter school political teaching materials, the education departments of each province and city should immediately compile and print teaching material outlines based on Chairman Mao's opening speech at the Third Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Premier Zhou's "Political Report," and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's "Report on the Movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea to Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country"; and should also compile and print teaching material outlines on land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, democratic reform, and the marriage law, combined with local conditions. The above teaching material outlines should be timely and selectively transmitted to winter school teachers.

　　4. When strengthening political and current affairs learning, winter schools in various localities should persist in carrying out cultural literacy education as much as possible; in more formal peasant spare-time primary schools (year-round civilian schools), a certain system should be gradually established on the original basis to carry out political and cultural learning.

　　5. Cadres and activists at all district and village levels should take the lead in participating in political and cultural learning in winter schools and peasant spare-time schools to create a heat wave in this year's winter school movement. Last year, the number of peasants enrolled in winter schools across the country reached 25 million, and more than 11 million have transferred to peasant spare-time primary schools this autumn. We should strive to have 35 million people participate in winter schools this year and 18 million transfer to peasant spare-time schools next year. Educational workers across the country should immediately mobilize, unite with all relevant parties, and strive to achieve the above goals and successfully complete the central task pointed out by Chairman Mao.

　　中央人民政府教育部关于加强今年冬学政治时事教育的指示
    全国各大行政区对今年冬学运动多数已发出指示，并已作了布置。毛主席最近在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议上指示我们：继续加强抗美援朝的工作，增加生产、厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军，这是中国人民今天的中心任务。冬学是教育和组织广大农民群众的有力武器，我们应该充分运用这个武器，配合其他工作，来实现上述的中心任务。为此，特作如下指示：
    一、今年全国各地的冬学均应普遍和深入地向农民群众进行抗美援朝爱国主义的教育，推进增产节约和爱国公约运动，并结合当地情况，进行关于土地改革、民主改革、生产互助以及婚姻法等政策教育。这是今年冬学运动的首要任务。冬学文化学习的内容应尽可能与政治教育相结合。各地应防止和纠正因孤立地强调文化学习而轻视政治时事教育的偏向。
    二、为了胜利地完成这一任务，各地领导机关应组织各方面的力量，在统一的计划下，分工合作，进行这一工作。县、区、村均应组织有专人负责的农民业余教育委员会或冬学运动委员会，动员和组织有条件的区、村干部，驻在地的机关干部、宣传员和政治水平较高的小学教师，担任冬学的政治教员，由他们作讲演或上课。事先应以县为单位集中政治教员进行短期训练，指示教育内容和教学方法的要点。
    三、今年冬学的政治教材，各省、市教育部门应即根据人民政协全国委员会第三次会议上毛主席的开会词、周总理的《政治报告》和彭真副主席《关于抗美援朝保家卫国运动的报告》，编印教材提纲；并应结合当地情况编印关于土地改革、镇压反革命、民主改革和婚姻法等教材提纲。以上教材提纲均应及时地和有重点地传授给冬学教师。
    四、各地冬学在加强政治时事学习时，应尽可能坚持进行文化识字教育；在比较正规的农民业余初等学校（常年民校），尤应在原有基础上，逐渐建立一定的制度，进行政治与文化学习。
    五、冬学和农民业余学校的政治与文化学习，各地区、村干部和积极分子尤应带头参加，以造成今年冬学运动的热潮。去年全国冬学入学农民已达二千五百万人，到今年秋季转入农民业余初等学校的已达一千一百余万人。我们应争取今年参加冬学的人数达到三千五百万人，明年转入农民业余学校的达到一千八百万人。全国教育工作者应立即动员起来，联合各有关方面，为达到上述目标，胜利完成毛主席所指出的中心任务而奋斗。
