The Leader of the Romanian People - Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej

November 8th this year is the 50th birthday of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, the beloved leader of the Romanian people and a good friend of the working people of the world. His name is being hailed by the Romanian people with feelings full of love. The Romanian people are proud and honored to have such a wise leader.

From the day he joined the workers' movement, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej wholeheartedly dedicated his entire life to the cause of the liberation of the working class. He steadfastly followed the path indicated by Lenin and Stalin, waged an irreconcilable struggle against all tendencies that violated the Party's line, and held unlimited confidence in the strength of the working class and the victorious future of its cause.

Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej was born on November 8, 1901, in a worker's family in Bârlad. He began working at the age of eleven. He worked in many factories and later became an electrical technician on the railway. Before the great strike of the autumn of 1920, although he was still very young, he had already participated in various struggles of the workers.

Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej actively organized workers to fight for their vital demands. Therefore, he gained the trust of the masses and was elected as the representative of the railway workers of Galați in 1929, and later as a member of the railway technicians' trade union.

Due to his revolutionary activities, he was exiled by the Romanian bourgeois-landlord regime to Dej, a small city in Transylvania. But there, he continued to organize railway workers to prepare for a general strike of railway workers nationwide, to oppose the bourgeoisie's attempt to place the entire burden of the economic crisis on the shoulders of the workers, in order to guarantee their own and their masters' - the American, British, and French imperialists' - extra profits. Under the leadership of the Party, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej organized a national conference of railway workers' representatives in Bucharest on March 20, 1932. At the meeting, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej was elected as the secretary of the Action Committee, and soon after, as a member of the unified Trade Union Confederation.

In January 1932, the Romanian Communist Party convened its Fifth Party Congress. While implementing the Party's political line, Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej prepared a large movement of railway and oil mine workers. The climax of this movement was the great strike of January-February 1933. He went to various important railway centers to mobilize workers to rise up in struggle, uniting the strength of the workers to prepare to fight against the bourgeois-landlord government. He was often tailed by the gendarmerie and arrested several times.

After the bloody suppression of the great strike on February 16, 1933, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej was arrested and sent to a military court for being the leader of the strike.

During the trial, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej strongly exposed the provocative nature of the trial, the bourgeois-landlord government's policy of betraying national interests and opposing the people, and their policy of preparing for a fascist dictatorship and attempting to attack the Soviet Union.

Because of the bourgeoisie's hatred for his heroic struggle in the bourgeois court and his struggle to lead the masses of workers, and in order to make the workers lose their leader, the bourgeois court sentenced him to twelve and a half years of hard labor. The reactionary government constantly transferred him from one prison to another. But Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, regardless of the cruel and barbaric system in the prison, united the ranks of political prisoners in prison, turning the prison into a true communist university. In 1934, while he was still in prison, he was elected as a member of the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party.

During its thirty years of growth, the Romanian Communist Party educated its members to love the Soviet Union infinitely, and to love the great leader and teacher of the world's people - Stalin. Confidence in the continuous growth and strengthening of Soviet power encouraged the Communist Party members, increased their strength, and strengthened their will in the arduous prison struggle. This was especially evident in the telegram of congratulations sent to Comrade Stalin by the secret conference of underground communists in Doftana, led by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej.

In 1940, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej was sent to the Caransebeș prison, and later to the Târgu Jiu concentration camp. From there, he led the anti-fascist struggle in the concentration camps and prisons of Romania. From prison, he strived to concentrate the Party's efforts on establishing a broad patriotic anti-fascist front.

On August 13, 1944, under the organization of the leading organs of the Romanian Communist Party, Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej escaped from the concentration camp. The Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party, headed by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, mobilized the people to rise up against Hitler's Germany. Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej personally directed the preparations for the overthrow of the Antonescu fascist government and the August 23rd uprising.

The liberation of Romania by the Soviet army opened up a new era for the Romanian working class and its party, and for the Romanian people.

Under the leadership of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party mobilized the workers and all the working people to fight against the reactionary government and strive for the establishment of a people's democratic system.

At the National Conference of the Romanian Communist Party in 1945, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej delivered a political summary report on behalf of the Party Central Committee and put forward the following tasks: to fight for democracy and national independence, to restore the national economy destroyed by the war and achieve national industrialization, and to fight for the unity of the working class. At this conference, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej was elected as the General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party.

After the liberation of Romania, all the great achievements of the Romanian Communist Party and the Romanian people: the land reform, the victory of the National Assembly elections in November 1946, the financial reform, the final expulsion of the representatives of the bourgeoisie from the government, the overthrow of the monarchy, the proclamation of the People's Republic, the nationalization of the main means of production, etc. - all this is inseparable from the name of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej.

In February 1948, under the leadership of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, the two working-class parties, the Romanian Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party, merged into the Romanian Workers' Party. As a Marxist-Leninist party, the establishment of the Romanian Workers' Party was a great victory for the Romanian working class, and it also helped to consolidate the democratic and socialist camp.

At the Cominform meeting in November 1949, Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej delivered a report on "The Yugoslav Communist Party in the Hands of Murderers and Spies," exposing the crimes of the imperialist lackeys, the despicable Tito clique.

In March 1949, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej reported at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party on the tasks of the Party in consolidating the worker-peasant alliance and striving for the socialist transformation of the countryside. On the initiative of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, and under his direct leadership, Romania formulated the first Five-Year Plan and the national electrification plan. This is a great plan for the Romanian people to eliminate economic backwardness and build socialism.

Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej constantly taught the Romanian Workers' Party that the Party's central task at present is the struggle for peace, and that consolidating the People's Democratic Republic is a powerful means of opposing the aggressive plans of the American and British imperialists. His spirit of proletarian internationalism and the spirit of eternal friendship with the Soviet Union educate the broad masses of the people. He pointed out: "The working people of Romania are watching the struggle of the working class in imperialist and colonial countries with great sympathy and are united with them. The working people of Romania infinitely love Stalin, and Stalin's fatherly concern for the various problems of the Romanian people is the source of courage and strength for the working people."

Under the leadership of the Workers' Party headed by their beloved leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, under the banner of Lenin and Stalin, the Romanian people are victoriously building socialism. Let us wish Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej a long life. (Liu Chi, translated) (Xinhua News Agency) (with picture)

    罗马尼亚人民的领袖——乔治乌—德治
    今年十一月八日，是罗马尼亚人民敬爱的领袖、世界劳动人民的好朋友乔治乌—德治的五十寿辰。他的名字被罗马尼亚人民以充满热爱的感情来欢呼着。罗马尼亚人民以有这样一位英明的领袖而感到骄傲和光荣。
    乔治乌—德治从参加工人运动的那一天起，就全心全意地把自己的整个生命交给了工人阶级的解放事业。他坚持不渝地按照着列宁和斯大林所指示的道路，对违反党的路线的一切倾向进行不调和的斗争，对工人阶级的力量与自己事业的胜利前途抱有无限的信心。
    ×××
    乔治乌—德治同志于一九○一年十一月八日出生在巴拉德市一个工人家庭里。十一岁时就开始做工。他曾在许多工厂里做过工，后来到铁路上担任电气技师。一九二○年秋天的大罢工之前，虽然他还很年青，但早已参加了工人的各种斗争了。
    乔治乌—德治积极地为争取工人的切身要求，组织工人起来斗争。因此他获得了群众的信任，在一九二九年被选为加拉兹铁路工人的代表，后来又被选为铁路技工的职工会委员。
    由于他的革命活动，他被罗马尼亚资产阶级——地主政权放逐到德兰斯瓦尼亚的一个小城市——德治去。但在那里，他仍旧从事组织铁路工人的工作，以准备全国铁路工人的总罢工，来反对资产阶级企图把经济危机的整个重担放在工人肩上，借以保证他们自己和他们的主子——美、英、法帝国主义者的额外利润。在党的领导下，乔治乌—德治于一九三二年三月二十日在布加勒斯特组织了全国铁路工人代表会议。会上，乔治乌—德治被选为行动委员会的书记，不久以后又被选为统一的职工总会的委员。
    一九三二年一月，罗马尼亚共产党召开了第五次党代表大会。乔治乌—德治同志一面贯彻党的政治路线，同时准备着一个很大的铁路工人与油矿工人的运动，这个运动的最高潮就是一九三三年的一—二月大罢工。他曾到各个最重要的铁路中心去，到处发动工人起来斗争，团结工人的力量准备与资产阶级——地主的政府进行战斗。他常被宪兵尾追，并数次被逮捕。
    一九三三年二月十六日的大罢工受到血腥镇压以后，乔治乌—德治就被捕了，并由于他是罢工的领导者而被送到军事法庭。
    在审讯时，乔治乌—德治极力揭露审讯的挑拨性质，揭露资产阶级——地主政府的出卖民族利益和反人民的政策，并揭露他们实行准备法西斯专政与企图进攻苏联的政策。
    由于仇视他在资产阶级法庭上的英勇斗争和他领导工人群众的斗争，并为了使工人失去自己的领袖，资产阶级的法庭就判决他十二年半的苦役。反动政府不断地把他由这个监狱送到另一个监狱。但乔治乌—德治不顾监狱中残忍野蛮的制度，在狱中团结着政治犯的队伍，把监狱变成了真正的共产主义的大学。一九三四年他还在监狱中时，就被选为罗马尼亚共产党的中央委员。
    罗马尼亚共产党在其成长的三十年间，教育他的党员无限地热爱苏联，热爱世界人民伟大的领袖和导师——斯大林。对苏联威力的不断成长、壮大的信心鼓舞着共产党员，增加了他们的力量，加强了他们在艰苦的监狱斗争中的意志。这特别表现在以乔治乌—德治为首的道富坦地下共产党员秘密会议寄给斯大林同志的贺电中。
    一九四○年，乔治乌—德治被送到加兰谢别斯监狱去，后来又被送到推尔古·执吾的集中营里。他就由这里领导了罗马尼亚的集中营和监狱中的反法西斯斗争。他从狱中努力使党集中力量建立广泛的爱国反法西斯战线。
    一九四四年八月十三日，在罗马尼亚共产党的领导机关组织之下，乔治乌—德治同志从集中营逃了出来。罗马尼亚共产党中央以乔治乌—德治为首，发动人民起来反对希特勒德国。乔治乌—德治亲自指挥了推翻安东尼斯古法西斯政府的准备工作和八月二十三日的起义。
    苏军的解放罗马尼亚，为罗马尼亚的工人阶级及其政党和罗马尼亚人民展开了一个新的时代。
    罗马尼亚共产党中央委员会在乔治乌—德治领导下，动员了工人与全体劳动人民为反对反动政府、争取建立人民民主制度而斗争。
    在一九四五年罗马尼亚共产党全国代表会议上，乔治乌—德治代表党中央委员会作了政治总结报告，并提出下列任务：为争取民主与民族独立，为恢复被战争破坏的国民经济与实现国家工业化，并为争取工人阶级的团结而斗争。在这次会议上，乔治乌—德治被选为罗马尼亚共产党的总书记。
    罗马尼亚解放后，罗马尼亚共产党和罗马尼亚人民的一切伟大成就：土地改革，一九四六年十一月国民议会选举的胜利，金融改革，最后地从政府中驱逐资产阶级的代表，推翻君主制，人民共和国的宣告成立，主要生产资料的国有等等——这一切都是与乔治乌—德治的名字分不开的。
    在一九四八年二月，在乔治乌—德治的领导下，两个工人阶级政党罗马尼亚共产党和社会民主党合并为罗马尼亚工人党。作为马克思列宁主义的政党，罗马尼亚工人党的成立是罗马尼亚工人阶级的巨大胜利，而且也更帮助了民主、社会主义阵营的巩固。
    乔治乌—德治同志在一九四九年十一月的共产党情报局会议上，作了“在杀人犯与间谍掌握中的南斯拉夫共产党”的报告，揭露了帝国主义的走狗、卑鄙的铁托集团的罪恶。
    一九四九年三月，乔治乌—德治在罗马尼亚共产党中央委员会全体会议上报告了党在巩固工农联盟与争取农村的社会主义改造的斗争中的任务。根据乔治乌—德治的倡议，并在他的直接领导下，罗马尼亚制订了第一个五年计划和国家电气化计划。这是罗马尼亚人民消灭经济落后、建设社会主义的一个伟大的计划。
    乔治乌—德治经常教导罗马尼亚工人党：党在目前的中心任务，就是争取和平的斗争，而巩固人民民主共和国是反对美英帝国主义者侵略计划的有力手段。他的无产阶级国际主义精神、永远与苏联友好的精神教育着广大的人民群众，他曾指出：“罗马尼亚的劳动人民以极大的同情注视着帝国主义与殖民地国家的工人阶级的斗争，并与他们团结一致。罗马尼亚的劳动人民无限地热爱斯大林，斯大林对罗马尼亚人民各种问题的慈父般的关怀是劳动人民勇敢与力量的源泉。”
    罗马尼亚人民在以其敬爱的领袖乔治乌—德治为首的工人党领导下，在列宁、斯大林的旗帜下，正在胜利地建设着社会主义。让我们祝福乔治乌—德治同志万寿无疆。    （刘迟编译）    （新华社）（附图片）
