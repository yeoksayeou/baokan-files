Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 2nd—An increasing number of American labor unions, progressive groups, and war-weary soldiers involved in the invasion of Korea are demanding an end to the Korean War and a restoration of peace.

More than three hundred union leaders and workshop representatives from sixty unions affiliated with the AFL, CIO, and independent unions, together with the New York Labor Peace Conference, are jointly calling for a meeting in December to discuss how to end the Korean War, how to resolve international differences through negotiation to strive for peace, and how to alleviate the unbearable burdens of wage freezes, price increases, and increased taxes. The union leaders, workshop representatives, and Labor Peace Conference jointly issued a call saying: As long as labor can stand up and speak out, it is possible to achieve peace in Korea and to make the government end its oppression of labor.

The Northern California Peace Committee is launching a broad movement to strive for peace in Korea. Peace activists are distributing leaflets among people's organizations and residents, advocating for an end to the Korean War on Armistice Day for World War I—November 11th. Their central slogan is: "Let the boys start heading home before Christmas!" Each leaflet is attached with a petition to Truman, demanding an immediate ceasefire in Korea and five-power talks to seek peace.

The "Chicago Tribune" and "New York Daily News" recently published letters written home by six American soldiers wounded in Korea. One of the letters said: "If Americans could see what their children are going through in Korea, they would never want war again. Let me tell you, in just three months here, I've seen enough to last me a lifetime." The letter concluded with an appeal: "We pray for peace, that's all we can do here. Isn't there anyone who can help us?"

    美国工会和各地和平委员会广泛展开争取朝鲜和平运动
    美国侵朝负伤士兵呼吁美国人民制止侵朝
    【新华社布拉格二日电】越来越多的美国工会、进步团体以及厌战的侵朝士兵要求终止朝鲜战争，恢复和平。
    六十个属于劳联、产联的工会和独立工会的三百多个工会领袖以及车间代表们，和纽约劳工和平会议一道，共同要求在十二月间举行会议，讨论如何终止朝鲜战争，如何通过谈判解决各国间的歧见以争取和平，以及解除工资冻结、物价上涨和捐税加重等不可忍受的负担等问题。工会领袖、车间代表们和劳工和平会议联合发出的号召说：只要劳工能站起来说话，是可以使朝鲜获得和平，并使政府终止对劳工的压迫的。
    北加利福尼亚和平委员会正在展开一个广泛的争取朝鲜和平的运动。和平战士们在人民团体及居民中散发传单，主张在第一次世界大战停战日——十一月十一日终止朝鲜战争。他们的中心口号是：“让孩子们在圣诞节以前动身回家！”每一张传单上都附有一份致杜鲁门的请愿书，要求立即在朝鲜停火并举行五大国谈判，以谋求和平。
    “芝加哥论坛报”及“纽约每日新闻”最近刊载六个在朝鲜负伤的美国士兵写回国的信，其中的一封信说：“要是美国人能够看到他们的孩子在朝鲜的遭遇，他们就再也不会想要战争了。让我告诉你，在这只有三个月的时间里，我所看到的东西已经够我受的了。”这封信最后呼吁说：“我们祈祷和平，这是我们在这里所能做到的一切。难道没有人能够帮助我们吗？”
