Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 21st: DPRK Foreign Minister Park Heon-young sent telegrams on the 19th to the President of the United Nations General Assembly and the President of the United Nations Security Council respectively, strongly condemning the shameless lies of the US side in smearing the Korean and Chinese People’s Armies for killing prisoners. He also made four solemn demands on behalf of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

The telegram first exposed the sinister purpose of the US aggressors in fabricating the lie that the Korean and Chinese People's Armies "killed prisoners": First, to delay the Korean armistice negotiations and create excuses to obstruct the armistice talks; Second, to cover up their crimes of slaughtering prisoners and peaceful Korean residents and deceive world opinion.

The telegram then described the crimes of the US aggressors in slaughtering prisoners and peaceful Korean residents: Our statements, as well as Korean and foreign newspapers, have continuously exposed the fact that the US aggressor troops have tortured and murdered our captured personnel in order to force them to reveal military secrets. For example, there is a prisoner-of-war camp on a certain island in Gyeongsangnam-do, which is called "Death Island" by the local residents. The corpses of prisoners were carried out of this prisoner-of-war camp every day. On the gallows in the prisoner-of-war camp, there were often the bodies of those who had been hanged, and the military police tied the corpses to telephone poles for shooting practice. According to extremely incomplete statistics, in many prisoner-of-war camps in South Korea, nearly 17,000 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have been killed or starved to death this year alone.

While slaughtering prisoners, the US aggressor troops also bombed and strafed Korean cities and villages, slaughtering peaceful residents. In the most recent four and a half months, US aircraft dropped more than 25,000 bombs of various types in the Pyongyang area alone, killing and wounding more than 8,500 women and children. In the most recent two and a half months, US aircraft have carried out more than 15,000 air raids on Pyongyang, Wonsan, Sariwon, Yangdeok, Yeonbaek and other cities.

The telegram concluded: The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, while exposing the hypocritical and malicious slanders spread by the US imperialists against the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, puts forward the following demands: Immediately stop military actions in Korea as the first step towards a peaceful solution to the Korean issue; the troops on the front lines must each withdraw two kilometers to establish a demilitarized zone, based on the fair and reasonable proposals of the representatives of the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army and the Command of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army; all foreign troops must withdraw from Korea; those criminals who attempt to prolong the Korean War and the organizers and perpetrators of atrocities against the peaceful Korean people must be severely punished.

    朝鲜外务相朴宪永电联大及安理会主席
    痛斥美方对朝中人民部队的诽谤
    提出关于解决朝鲜问题的四项严正要求 【新华社平壤二十一日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永在十九日分别致电联合国大会主席和联合国安全理事会主席，严词斥责美方诬蔑朝中人民军队杀害俘虏的无耻谎言，并代表朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府提出四项严正要求。
    电文首先揭露美国侵略者捏造朝中人民军队“杀害俘虏”的谎言的罪恶目的在于：一、拖延朝鲜停战谈判，为阻挠停战谈判制造借口；二、掩盖他们屠杀俘虏和朝鲜和平居民的罪行，欺骗世界舆论。
    电文接着叙述美国侵略者屠杀俘虏及朝鲜和平居民的罪行说：我们的声明以及朝鲜和外国的报刊，曾不断地揭露美国侵略军为逼迫我方被俘人员谈出军事机密而施行酷刑拷问和屠杀的事实。例如：在庆尚南道某一个岛上设着一个俘虏营，该岛被当地居民称为“死亡岛”。这个俘虏营每天搬运出俘虏的尸体，俘虏营的绞刑台上，经常有被绞死者的尸体，宪兵们并把尸体绑在电线杆上作射击演习。据极不完全的统计：在南朝鲜的许多俘虏营中，仅在今年，就有近一万七千名朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的被俘人员被杀害或饿死。
    在屠杀俘虏的同时，美国侵略军并轰炸扫射朝鲜的城市和乡村，屠杀和平居民。在最近的四个半月中，美国飞机在平壤地区就投掷了各种炸弹二万五千颗以上，炸死炸伤妇孺逾八千五百人。在最近两个半月中，美国飞机对平壤、元山、沙里院、阳德、延白及其他城市空袭了一万五千次以上。
    电文最后说：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在揭穿美帝国主义者所散布的对朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的虚伪恶毒的诽谤的同时，提出以下的要求：立即停止朝鲜的军事行动，作为和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步；必须根据朝鲜人民军总司令部和中国人民志愿军司令部代表的公平合理的建议，使前线的军队各撤退二公里，以建立非军事区；一切外国军队撤出朝鲜；严惩企图延长朝鲜战争的罪犯和对和平的朝鲜人民实施暴行的组织者及执行者。
