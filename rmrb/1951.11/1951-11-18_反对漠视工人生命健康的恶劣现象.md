    Oppose the Evil Phenomenon of Disregarding Workers' Lives and Health
    The safety and hygiene conditions at the state-owned Zhenyu Match Factory in Anyang City, Pingyuan Province, are very poor, seriously damaging the health of workers. Among the factory's 218 employees, a quarter suffer from lung diseases, 90 percent suffer from trachoma, and many also suffer from gastrointestinal diseases. The factory buildings have no ventilation equipment, and rosin and phosphorus fumes fill the air. The toilets are extremely dirty. Fire buckets and water pits are full of foul water. The workers' dormitories are very damp. Workers have meetings almost every night, and Party members, Youth League members, and activists have even more meetings.
    The factory's administrative leaders say that they "do not disregard, but have no way" to deal with the safety and health problems of the workers. This is an excuse. Would it not be easy to open some windows in the factory buildings and dormitories, to clean the toilets, and to keep the water in the fire buckets clean? Is it so difficult to cherish the energy of the masses and to reduce unnecessary meetings? These comrades should examine their attitude towards the workers. Are they standing with the workers, treating the workers' pain as their own and actively trying to solve it? Or are they standing beside the workers, indifferent to the workers' pain, and crying about difficulties? Comrades with similar erroneous ideas should make a thorough self-examination.

　　反对漠视工人生命健康的恶劣现象
    平原省安阳市公营振裕火柴厂的安全卫生情况很不好，严重地损害了工人的健康。该厂二百一十八名职工中，患肺病者达四分之一，患砂眼者达百分之九十，患肠胃病者也很多。厂房中没有通风设备，松香、磷烟乱飞。厕所肮脏异常。防火水桶内和水坑内满是臭水。工人宿舍里非常潮湿。工人差不多每天晚上都要开会，党员、团员、积极分子开的会更多。
    该厂的行政领导干部说，他们对于工人的安全卫生问题，“不是不重视，而是没有办法”。这是一种藉口。在厂房、宿舍中开一些窗子，把厕所打扫得干净一些，使防火水桶中的水保持清洁，这难道不是轻而易举的事情吗？珍惜群众精力、少开一些不必要的会议，这难道是十分困难的事情吗？这些同志，应该检查自己对待工人的态度。是站在工人一起，把工人的痛苦当作自己的痛苦，而积极想法加以解决呢？还是站在工人旁边，对工人的痛苦漠不关心，而大叫困难呢？有类似错误思想的同志，都应该作一次深入的检查。
