Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 17th—The organs of the CCP Central Committee's East China Bureau, responding to the call for "increasing production and practicing thrift to support the Chinese People's Volunteers," convened a general meeting of all staff members on the evening of the 15th of this month. Wei Wenbo, Secretary-General of the CCP Central Committee's East China Bureau, delivered a detailed report by Rao Shushi, Secretary of the CCP Central Committee's East China Bureau, at the meeting of party member cadres directly under the East China Bureau. Wei Wenbo proposed that, to achieve streamlining and thrift within the East China Bureau organs, the following measures must be taken: In terms of streamlining: starting from the current work situation and according to specific work needs, strive to consolidate institutions, reduce levels, and improve work efficiency. In terms of thrift: (1) Office expenses should be reduced by 10 to 20 percent. The focus should be on saving paper, printing, typing, and other items. Expenses for tap water, electricity, telephone, and other miscellaneous items should not exceed the regulations. Subscriptions to books and newspapers must be approved. (2) Except for the use of cars and houses, which will be subject to separate unified regulations, furniture and equipment will generally not be added. (3) Cigarettes should not be provided at various meetings and for visiting cadres, and they should not be invited to see operas or visit other places; banquets and gifts are strictly prohibited. (4) Strictly implement the budget and final accounts system and procedures for expenditure. Clean up materials, investigate the organs' production funds, report truthfully, strictly prohibit waste, and do not arbitrarily use them. In order to complete the above tasks, Wei Wenbo pointed out that it is necessary to rely on the political consciousness and ideological transformation of each staff member, and to launch criticism and self-criticism against bureaucratic phenomena and all incorrect ideological styles; inspection teams should be organized from top to bottom and from bottom to top to conduct mutual inspections in various departments to supervise implementation. All departments must submit plans for streamlining and thrift within the next week and begin implementation at the same time. Finally, Wu Zhongchao, Deputy Secretary-General of the CCP Central Committee's East China Bureau, announced the establishment of the East China Bureau Organs Streamlining and Thrift Committee, which will begin work immediately to discuss and formulate specific plans for the East China Bureau organs to implement streamlining and thrift.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 20th—The Shandong Provincial Leading Organs have begun to carry out the work of reorganization and thrift in a planned and systematic manner. The Shandong Provincial Organs Reorganization and Thrift Committee was established on the 3rd of this month. Based on the work situation of various provincial organs, the committee has made a decision on vigorously implementing the work of reorganization and thrift, specifically stipulating the plans and steps for reorganization and thrift work. Currently, 31 units, including various departments, bureaus, banks, and academies of the Shandong Provincial People's Government, the Shandong Branch of the CCP Central Committee, the Shandong Provincial People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee, and various people's organizations at the provincial level, have established reorganization and thrift sub-committees.

The Shandong Provincial People's Government's Department of Commerce has initially inspected the phenomena of overlapping institutions, slow handling of affairs, and extravagance and waste.
