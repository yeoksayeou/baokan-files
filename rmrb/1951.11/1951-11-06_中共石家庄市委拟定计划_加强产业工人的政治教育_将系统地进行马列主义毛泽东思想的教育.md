　　The Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Formulates a Plan
　　To Strengthen Political Education for Industrial Workers
　　Will Systematically Conduct Education in Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought
　　The Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in order to conduct political education among the working masses in a planned way, issued a "Plan to Strengthen Political Education for Industrial Workers" on September 13th. The plan first pointed out that in the early days of the liberation of Shijiazhuang, the municipal party committee and other leading organs conducted enlightenment political education among the working masses. Subsequently, education in historical materialism was carried out among a portion of the workers. This education enlightened the class consciousness of the working masses, enabled them to begin to establish a sense of ownership and new labor concepts, and enabled the workers to correctly understand the Communist Party. As a result, the production enthusiasm of the working masses generally increased. However, since the leadership proposed strengthening workers' cultural education, various factories and mines have relaxed their political education for workers; therefore, a tendency has occurred among workers to simply study technology and culture while neglecting politics, or even ignoring politics altogether. During the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, this situation changed greatly, and various factories and mines conducted patriotic and internationalist education among the working masses, but it was not frequent or profound enough, especially lacking systematic education in Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Because the issue of workers' political education has not been well resolved, the political consciousness of the workers is far behind the requirements of national construction. Although the activists among the workers have very high production enthusiasm, because they do not pay attention to political study, their views on things mostly remain at the level of simple class viewpoints. Many workers still have purely economic viewpoints, purely technical viewpoints, and conservative ideas. Some workers even look down on labor and believe in fate. This situation must be changed. Therefore, the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee, in its plan to strengthen workers' political education, stipulated in detail that industrial workers should undergo systematic education in Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, with the current specific content being education in communism and the Communist Party. This education will begin in January next year, and in factories and mines with good conditions, it is required to be completed within one and a half to two years; in factories and mines with poor conditions, the education time can be appropriately extended. Before formally starting this education, in December this year, each factory and mine must first conduct education in the history of the Chinese workers' movement. When conducting this education, typical materials from the local workers' movement before liberation and the workers' war preparedness and production competitions after liberation can be selected and combined for education, so that workers can recognize the glorious and great revolutionary traditions of the Chinese working class, the inseparable relationship between the Chinese Communist Party and the working class, and lay the foundation for conducting systematic education in communism and the Communist Party.
　　When conducting the above two types of education, it is necessary to connect them with the thinking of the working masses and with the production activities of the factory, criticize various non-proletarian ideas (such as purely economic viewpoints and purely technical viewpoints), enhance workers' political enthusiasm, and promote current production. It is necessary to change the old-fashioned "teachers lecture, students listen" injection-style teaching method. Political teachers must first be familiar with the production activities of their department, understand the workers' lives and thoughts, and analyze these situations, closely combine them with the teaching materials, and give lively and vivid lectures.
　　The plan proposes that factories and mines with around 500 people can set up a full-time political teacher. These teachers should be selected from industrial workers who have a certain level of education, have the ability to lecture, and have the potential for development. Factories and mines with a small number of workers can be adjusted from factory and mine cadres, or selected from cultural teachers who meet the above conditions to serve concurrently. The plan pointed out that whether the political teachers are qualified is the primary key to whether political education can be done well. All factories and mines should focus on the long-term interests of the workers and seriously do a good job in assigning political teachers. The regulations regarding political study time are: for units with work hours of less than ten hours, one hour of political class per week; for factories and mines with work hours of more than ten hours, one and a half hours of political class every two weeks. Resolutely correct the bad phenomenon of randomly squeezing study time. Specific allocation of study time: each factory and mine can consider establishing a "political month" education method, dividing a semester into six segments (each segment equivalent to one month), and dedicating one "political month" to conduct political education for one or several classes. This can carry out several units and can centrally solve several problems. There is no experience in implementing this method yet, and each unit can research and create new methods. The plan also pointed out that the Party committee must strengthen its leadership over workers' political education. The municipal party committee and the factory and mine party committees and general branches should establish a system of studying workers' political education once a month, in order to promptly study the situation, arrange work, and solve problems. And it is necessary to vigorously overcome the erroneous viewpoints of the working masses and factory and mine cadres who neglect and despise political education. At the same time, in the process of education, it is necessary to effectively overcome the erroneous viewpoints of some leading cadres and political teachers who make political education divorced from current production and various work tasks; it is also necessary to oppose the tendency of empiricism that only pays attention to daily production and work and deals with things on a case-by-case basis.
　　The Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee's plan to strengthen political education for industrial workers also made specific provisions on how to strengthen and organize the leading organs of workers' spare-time schools.

### 中共石家庄市委拟定计划  加强产业工人的政治教育  将系统地进行马列主义毛泽东思想的教育

　　中共石家庄市委拟定计划
　  加强产业工人的政治教育
　  将系统地进行马列主义毛泽东思想的教育
    中共石家庄市委，为有计划地在工人群众中进行政治教育，于九月十三日发出“加强产业工人政治教育计划”。计划中首先指出：石家庄市解放初期，市委等领导机关曾在工人群众中进行了启蒙的政治教育。随后，又在一部分工人中进行了唯物史观教育。这些教育，启发了工人群众的阶级觉悟，使工人群众开始树立了主人翁思想与新的劳动观点，并使工人正确地认识了共产党。因此工人群众的生产积极性普遍提高。但自领导上提出加强工人文化教育后，各厂矿即放松了对工人的政治教育；因此在工人中发生了单纯学习技术和文化而轻视政治、甚至不问政治的偏向。在抗美援朝运动中，这种情况有了很大改变，各厂矿均在工人群众中进行了爱国主义与国际主义教育，但还不经常，也不深刻，特别是缺乏系统的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的教育。由于工人的政治教育问题没有很好地解决，致使工人的政治觉悟，远远落后于国家建设的要求。工人中的积极分子虽然生产热情很高，但因不注意政治学习，对事物的看法多半停留在朴素的阶级观点上。不少工人还存在着单纯经济观点、单纯技术观点及保守思想。甚至有些工人还轻视劳动、相信命运。这种情况必须改变，所以石家庄市委在加强工人政治教育计划中详细规定了：对产业工人进行系统的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的教育，当前的具体内容是进行共产主义与共产党的教育。这项教育将从明年元月开始，在条件好的厂矿，要求在一年半到两年内完成；条件差的厂矿，教育时间可适当延长。正式开始这项教育以前，在今年十二月份，各厂矿要先进行中国职工运动史的教育。在进行这项教育时，可选取本地解放前工人运动与解放后工人备战、生产竞赛中各种典型材料结合进行教育，以使职工认识到中国工人阶级光荣伟大的革命传统、中国共产党与工人阶级血肉不可分的关系，打下进行系统的共产主义与共产党的教育的基础。
    进行以上两种教育时，都必须联系工人群众的思想、联系工厂的生产活动，批判各种非无产阶级思想（如单纯经济观点和单纯技术观点等），提高工人政治热情，推动当前生产。要改变过去老一套的“教员讲，学员听”的注入式的教学方法。政治教员首先要熟悉本部门的生产活动，了解工人生活、思想情况，并分析这些情况，紧密结合教材，作生动活泼的讲授。
    计划中提出：在五百人左右的厂矿，可设一专职政治教员。这些教员，要从产业工人中选拔有一定文化程度、有讲授能力和有培养前途的党员来担任。工人数量少的厂矿，可从厂矿干部中调剂，或从文化教员里边选拔符合上述条件的兼任。计划指出：政治教员的能否称职，是政治教育能否搞好的首要环节，各厂矿应从工人的长远利益着眼，十分认真地作好政治教员的配调工作。关于政治学习时间的规定是：凡工作十小时以下的单位，每周上一小时的政治课；工作时间在十小时以上的厂矿，每两周进行一小时半的政治课。坚决纠正乱挤学习时间的不良现象。学习时间的具体分配：各厂矿可考虑建立“政治月”的教育方法，把一学期分为六段（每段相当一个月），一个“政治月”专门进行一班或若干班的政治教育，这样可进行若干个单元，能集中地解决几个问题。目前实行这种方法还没经验，各单位可研究创造新的方法。计划中又指出：党委必须加强对工人政治教育的领导。市委及厂矿党委会、总支应建立每月研究一次工人政治教育的制度，以便及时研究情况、布置工作、解决问题。并要大力克服工人群众及厂矿干部忽视与轻视政治教育的错误观点。同时在进行教育中，必须有效地克服部分领导干部及政治教员使政治教育脱离当前生产及各项工作任务的错误观点；也要反对只注意日常生产和工作的就事论事的经验主义的偏向。
    石家庄市委的加强产业工人政治教育计划，对如何加强与组织职工业余学校的领导机关等问题也作了具体规定。
