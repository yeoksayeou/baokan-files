In order to implement the resolutions of the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference,
The Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference summarized the rich experiences of our people's revolutionary struggles and construction endeavors over the past year, and stipulated the guidelines for various national tasks in the future. According to the resolutions of the conference, in the coming period, all democratic parties, people's organizations, and patriotic democratic individuals across the country should unite the broad masses of the people and focus on carrying out three central tasks: continuing to strengthen the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement; advocating and promoting the patriotic production increase and economizing movement; and extensively carrying out ideological remolding movements, systematically organizing the study movement of Mao Zedong Thought, which combines Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution. This conference is undoubtedly a major event in the political life of our people. Now that the conference has concluded, the task of the people of all localities, all classes, and all ethnic groups across the country is to strive to implement the various resolutions passed by the conference.

In order to quickly and smoothly achieve our future goals, all democratic parties, people's organizations, patriotic democratic individuals, and the broad masses of the people across the country should earnestly convey, discuss, and study the various documents of the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, understand its spirit and essence, so as to further mobilize all forces to implement the three central tasks decided by the conference.

Continuing to strengthen the Resist America, Aid Korea work is the sacred task of our people to defend their homes and the country, and to defend peace in Asia and the world. In the past year, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army fought side by side with the Korean People's Army on the Korean front, severely打击打the American aggressors and their accomplices and puppet troops. The people across the country launched an unprecedentedly large-scale patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea in the rear. Eighty percent of the people received education in patriotism and internationalism. In many places, 50 percent of the population signed patriotic pacts, which raised their political awareness. The broad masses of the people enthusiastically signed up to join the Volunteer Army and participate in front-line work, actively increasing production and donating to support the front lines. The People's Government swiftly eliminated the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, and suppressed the special agents and spies of imperialism. Various reform and construction tasks have also advanced rapidly in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement; the unity of people of all strata has become more consolidated. In the face of our powerful people's forces fighting for justice, the outwardly strong but inwardly weak American aggressors suffered extremely serious defeats on the Korean battlefield, retreating from the Yalu River to the vicinity of the 38th parallel, with heavier and heavier losses. This forced the American aggressors to engage in negotiations on the Korean armistice. The above are the main gains of our people's struggle to resist America and aid Korea.

However, the American adventurers, whose ambitions will not die, are constantly creating various obstacles to undermine and obstruct the Korean armistice negotiations, and continue their desperate offensive on the front lines. They are still occupying our country's Taiwan, continuing to violate our country's airspace, continuing to impose blockades and sabotage against our country, and are rearming Japan, threatening our country's security and threatening peace in Asia and the world. Therefore, we must not be satisfied with the victories we have already achieved and slacken our patriotic struggle to resist America and aid Korea; on the contrary, our people across the country must make persistent efforts and, as Chairman Mao instructed in his opening remarks at this conference, continue the great struggle to resist America and aid Korea "until the US government is willing to settle peacefully." We must resolutely strive to implement the "Resolution on the Work of Resisting America and Aiding Korea" of this conference. This means further mobilizing our manpower, material resources, and financial resources to continue to support the just war of resisting America and aiding Korea; continuing to develop and deepen the education of patriotism and internationalism, so that every place and every person in the country can truly receive this education; highly promoting the people's patriotism, thoroughly eliminating hidden imperialist special agents and spies; striving to complete and expand the movement to donate weapons, strengthening the work of giving preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers, and further popularizing and deepening the patriotic pact movement; and especially striving to launch a large-scale patriotic production increase and economizing movement.

Advocating and promoting the patriotic production increase and economizing movement, especially practicing strict economy and frugality, is of great significance for continuing to support our People's Volunteer Army and the Korean people's just war against American aggression. Chairman Mao told us in his opening remarks at this conference: "Increasing production and practicing economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is the central task of the Chinese people today." Increasing production and practicing economy also have significant effects on strengthening our national defense forces, increasing industrial and agricultural production, maintaining financial and price stability, improving enterprise management, and improving the efficiency of various tasks. One of the important financial and economic policies of the Central People's Government is to save and increase production. Article 40 of the Common Program clearly stipulates that we must "practice strict economy and frugality, gradually balance financial revenue and expenditure, and accumulate national production funds." The economic savings and production increase achievements of the Northeast Administrative Region this year, which reached the value of ten million tons of grain, are enough to illustrate the importance of saving and increasing production. One of the reasons why the great Soviet Union was able to build a socialist society and advance rapidly towards a communist society is that the Soviet people, under the teachings of Lenin and Stalin, conscientiously practiced socialist frugality, relied on the Soviet people's own strength to solve the funding problem of socialist construction, and developed a huge industry. Our country is a new democratic country led by the working class, and the state-owned economy with socialist characteristics is the leader in the economy. Therefore, we now have the necessary conditions to learn from the Soviet Union's socialist economizing theory and practical experience, combine the economizing movement with the production increase movement to improve productivity, eliminate waste and corruption, rationally use all manpower and material resources, and save a large amount of wealth from all aspects across the country for economic investment and national defense construction.

At present, many financial and economic departments have experienced many intolerable wastes due to poor management and some cadres' irresponsibility for the people's property. Government agencies, organizations, and individuals also have some extravagant waste phenomena. There are also some low-quality staff who are stained with the corrupt and degenerate style of landlords, bureaucrats, and compradors, and have committed corruption, causing undue losses to the property of the people and the country. We must use all kinds of wealth that may be wasted and embezzled across the country for national defense and economic construction. Therefore, government agencies at all levels, state-owned enterprises, as well as troops, organizations, and individuals, should resolutely oppose waste, practice strict economy, streamline institutions, and improve the efficiency of production and work, without hindering work and health, and formulate practical and effective methods to ensure their thorough implementation. All cadres and people should carry forward the glorious tradition of heroic hard work and simplicity, adhere to the excellent style of loyalty, honesty, and integrity, and overcome the bad styles and bad habits of extravagance and waste brought from the old society.

We should launch criticism and self-criticism throughout the country against all bad thoughts, bad work styles, and bad habits. Chairman Mao told us in his opening remarks at this conference that "ideological remolding, especially the ideological remolding of various intellectuals, is one of the important conditions for our country to thoroughly realize democratic reform in all aspects and gradually implement industrialization." As Chairman Mao has repeatedly told us, this ideological remolding should be carried out by criticism and self-criticism as the only method. In the past year, in the three major movements of resisting America and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppression of counter-revolutionaries, our people have launched extensive and organized anti-imperialist and anti-feudal ideological education and ideological struggle, which has greatly improved their political awareness. However, we must never overestimate our achievements on the ideological front, and we must continue to make great efforts to thoroughly criticize and eliminate the reactionary ideological influence spread by the past reactionary ruling class and imperialism in China for a long time, and systematically carry out the study of the theory and practice of the Chinese revolution, so that the revolutionary consciousness of the people across the country can have a solid foundation.

To make the people have thorough revolutionary consciousness, they must, as Chairman Mao pointed out in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship", completely "get rid of the influence of internal and external reactionaries", "transform their bad habits and bad thoughts from the old society, so as not to go the wrong way pointed out by the reactionaries, and continue to advance towards socialist society and communist society." This thorough revolutionary consciousness is only possible under the leadership of Marxist-Leninist thought, which represents the advanced elements of the working class, and only under the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought, which embodies Marxism-Leninism in China. All the victories that the Chinese people have achieved are inseparable from the Marxist-Leninist leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party. The speeches of representatives from all aspects at this conference have more fully demonstrated the enthusiasm of the people across the country for learning Marxism-Leninism. People recognize the truth from the experience of actual life and struggle, and then actively demand to learn and grasp this truth, in order to defeat and overcome various reactionary and wrong ideas, and to transform themselves and transform the world. This urgent mood is completely understandable. Therefore, this conference stipulated in its resolution to "extensively launch the ideological remolding movement and systematically organize the study movement of Mao Zedong Thought, which combines Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution." Now this movement has been rapidly and gradually launched among teachers in many universities, among various democratic parties, and among patriotic democratic people from all parties. We believe that this ideological remolding study movement will definitely have a significant effect on the ideological front. It will further consolidate our people's democratic dictatorship.

The Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference also made other important resolutions, while continuing to strengthen the movement to resist America and aid Korea, launching the patriotic production increase and economizing movement, and extensively launching the ideological remolding movement are the three unified and inseparable central tasks decided by this conference. We should mobilize all forces to complete these central tasks, to drive the continued and steady progress of various aspects of work, in order to win new and greater victories.

### 为实现人民政协全国委员会第三次会议的决议而奋斗

    为实现人民政协全国委员会第三次会议的决议而奋斗
    中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议，总结了过去一年来我国人民的革命斗争和建设事业的丰富经验，规定了今后全国各项工作的方针。按照会议的决议，在今后一个时期中，全国各民主党派、各人民团体及各界爱国民主人士应团结广大人民，着重进行三项中心工作，即继续加强抗美援朝运动；提倡和推动爱国增产节约运动；广泛开展思想改造运动，有系统地组织对于马克思列宁主义与中国革命实践相结合的毛泽东思想的学习运动。这次会议无疑地是我国人民政治生活中的一个重大事件。现在会议已经结束，全国各地方各阶层各民族人民的任务，就是为实现这次会议所通过的各项决议而奋斗。
    为了迅速地顺利地实现我们今后奋斗的目标，全国各民主党派、各人民团体、各界爱国民主人士和广大人民群众，都应该认真传达、讨论和学习人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议的各项文件，了解它的精神和实质，以便进一步动员一切力量，贯彻执行会议所决定的三项中心任务。
    继续加强抗美援朝工作是我国人民保家卫国、保卫亚洲和世界和平的神圣任务。过去一年间，我国人民志愿军在朝鲜前线，与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，沉重地打击了美国侵略者及其帮凶和傀儡的军队。全国人民在后方展开了历史上空前大规模的抗美援朝爱国运动，百分之八十的人民受到了爱国主义和国际主义的教育，许多地方有百分之五十的人口订立了爱国公约，提高了自己的政治觉悟。广大人民群众踊跃报名参加志愿军和参加战地工作，积极增产捐献支援前线。人民政府迅速地扫除了美帝国主义者在中国的侵略势力，镇压了帝国主义的特务、间谍分子。各项改革工作和建设工作，在抗美援朝运动中也都迅速地前进了；各阶层人民的团结更加巩固了。在我们为正义而斗争的强大的人民力量面前，外强中干的美国侵略者在朝鲜战场上遭受了异常严重的失败，从鸭绿江边败退到三八线附近，损失愈来愈重。这就逼使美国侵略者不能不进行关于朝鲜停战的谈判。以上这些，就是我国人民抗美援朝斗争的主要收获。
    但是野心不死的美国冒险家们还在不断地制造各种障碍来破坏和阻挠朝鲜停战谈判的进行，并在前线继续着他们绝望的进攻。他们还侵占着我国的台湾，继续侵犯我国的领空，继续对我国实行封锁和破坏，并且正在重新武装日本，威胁我国的安全，威胁亚洲和世界的和平。因此，我们决不能满足于已得的胜利，而松懈了我们抗美援朝的爱国斗争；相反的，我们全国人民必须再接再厉，按照毛主席在这次会议的开会词中所指示的，把抗美援朝的伟大斗争“继续进行到美国政府愿意和平解决的时候为止”。我们必须坚决为实现这次会议“关于抗美援朝工作的决议”而奋斗。这就是要进一步动员我们的人力、物力和财力，继续支持抗美援朝的正义战争；要继续发展和深入爱国主义和国际主义的教育，使全国每一处每一人都能确实受到这种教育；要高度发扬人民的爱国心，彻底肃清暗藏的帝国主义特务间谍分子；要努力完成和扩大捐献武器运动，加强优待革命烈士和革命军人家属的工作，进一步普及和深入爱国公约运动；特别要努力开展一个广大规模的爱国增产节约的运动。
    提倡和推动爱国增产节约运动，特别是厉行精简节约，对于继续支援我国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民反抗美国侵略的正义战争是有巨大意义的。毛主席在这次会议的开会词中告诉我们：“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军。这是中国人民今天的中心任务”。增产节约对于增强我国国防力量、增加工农业生产、保持金融和物价的稳定、改善企业经营、提高各种工作效率等方面也都具有重大的作用。中央人民政府重要的财政经济政策之一就是节约增产。共同纲领第四十条明白规定要“厉行精简节约，逐步平衡财政收支，积累国家生产资金”。东北行政区今年在经济上节约和增产的成绩，达到了一千万吨粮食的价值，就足以说明节约增产的重要性了。伟大的苏联所以能够建设社会主义社会并向共产主义社会猛进的原因之一，也就在于苏联人民在列宁、斯大林的教导下，认真实行社会主义的节约，依靠苏联人民自己的力量解决了社会主义建设的资金问题，发展了巨大的工业。我国是以工人阶级为领导的新民主主义国家，在经济上是以社会主义性质的国营经济为领导的，因此，我们现在已经具备了必要的条件，可以学习苏联社会主义节约的理论和实际经验，把节约运动与提高生产力的增产运动结合起来，消灭浪费和贪污，合理使用一切人力物力，从全国范围的一切方面，节省出大量的财富，用到经济投资和国防建设上去。
    目前有许多财政经济部门，因为管理不善和某些干部对人民财产不负责任，以致发生了许多不能容忍的浪费。政府机关、团体和个人也有若干铺张浪费现象。还有一部分品质恶劣的工作人员，沾染了地主、官僚、买办的腐化堕落的作风，发生了贪污行为，使人民和国家的财产遭到不应有的损失。我们必须把全国各种可能被浪费和贪污的财富用到国防建设和经济建设上去。因此，各级政府机关、国营企业以及部队、团体和个人，都应该在不妨害工作和健康的条件下，坚决反对浪费，厉行节约，精简机构，提高生产和工作的效率，并为此制订切实有效的办法，保证其彻底实现。一切干部和人民都应该发扬英勇勤劳和朴素的光荣传统，坚持忠诚老实和廉洁的优良作风，克服从旧社会带来的铺张浪费的坏作风和坏习惯。
    我们应该在全国范围内，对于一切坏思想、坏作风、坏习惯，展开批评和自我批评。毛主席在这次会议的开会词中告诉我们，“思想改造，首先是各种知识分子的思想改造，是我国在各方面彻底实现民主改革和逐步实行工业化的重要条件之一。”这种思想改造，又正如毛主席所一再告诉我们的，应以批评和自我批评为唯一的方法来进行。过去一年来，我国人民在抗美援朝、土地改革和镇压反革命的三大运动中，展开了广泛的、有组织的反帝国主义和反封建主义的思想教育和思想斗争，极大地提高了政治觉悟。但是我们决不应该把我们在思想战线上的成绩估计过高，我们还必须继续作极大的努力，彻底地批判与清除过去反动统治阶级和帝国主义在中国长期散布的反动思想影响，有系统地进行关于中国革命的理论和实际的学习，使全国人民的革命觉悟得到巩固的基础。
    要使人民群众有彻底的革命觉悟，就必须按照毛主席在“论人民民主专政”一文中所指出的，使他们自己彻底“脱离内外反动派的影响”，“改造自己从旧社会得来的坏习惯和坏思想，不使自己走入反动派所指引的错误路上去，并继续前进，向着社会主义社会和共产主义社会发展”。这种彻底的革命觉悟，只有在代表工人阶级先进分子的马克思列宁主义思想领导之下，只有在中国具体化了的马克思列宁主义思想即毛泽东思想的领导下才是可能的。中国人民所已经得到的一切胜利，都离不开毛泽东同志和中国共产党的马克思列宁主义的领导。在这次会议上各方面代表人物的发言，都更加充分地证明了全国人民要求学习马克思列宁主义的热情。人们从实际生活和斗争的经验中认识了真理，于是就积极要求学习和掌握这个真理，借以战胜与克服各种反动的和错误的思想，借以改造自己、改造世界，这种迫切的心情是完全可以理解的。因此，这次会议在决议中规定“广泛展开思想改造运动，有系统地组织对于马克思、列宁主义与中国革命实践相结合的毛泽东思想的学习运动”。现在这个运动已经迅速地在许多高等学校教师中，在各民主党派和各方爱国民主人士中逐渐开展了。我们相信这个思想改造的学习运动，一定会在思想战线上发生重大的效果。它将进一步巩固我们的人民民主专政。
    中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议还做了其他重要的决议，而继续加强抗美援朝运动、展开爱国增产节约运动和广泛展开思想改造运动，则是这次会议所决定的三项统一不可分的中心任务。我们应该动员一切力量，完成这些中心任务，来带动各方面工作继续稳步前进，以争取新的更大的胜利。
