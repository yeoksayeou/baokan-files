    The Chinese Anti-American and Aid-Korea Movement Encourages the Hungarian People
    István Havas, Head of the Hungarian People's Observation Delegation

    Editor's Note: István Havas, head of the Hungarian People's Observation Delegation and General Secretary of the Hungarian Democratic Women's League, who was invited to participate in China's National Day celebrations, visited East China and gave a speech at the Central People's Broadcasting Station before leaving Beijing on October 10. The station broadcast the recording of her speech on October 24. The following is a translation of her speech.

    Dear friends, dear comrades:

    We watch the lives of the Chinese people and Chinese women with admiration and envy. The October 1st Chinese National Day, to which we were invited, demonstrated the Chinese people's love for their motherland, the Communist Party, and the great leader Mao Zedong. We will never forget the solemn military parade of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the enthusiastic and colorful mass parade. These demonstrated their strength and high level of consciousness. In this parade, we saw the people correctly following their own people's government, never allowing others to take away the freedom they have already gained. Everywhere we saw women who are precious comrades to men, able to build and fight alongside them. What impressed me most was the conference celebrating the start of work for six female tram drivers. The heroic Chinese women have already proven that they can take up arms and fight for freedom alongside their husbands and sons; now they have proven that they are equal to men in building their motherland. I will always remember riding the tram driven by a young girl. The happy smile of these young girls seemed to say, "I have won, I have mastered this vehicle."

    Our welcoming friends and comrades gave us the opportunity to understand the lives of liberated farmers. We were sent to Lucun Village, where we saw happy farmers working on their own land.

    In this village of 487 households, we saw how the Chinese farmers love their motherland, the Communist Party, and the great leader Mao Zedong. Their simple answers to our questions were the best proof. A father of seven children said, "Mao Zedong gave me land, and now I am very happy. I have twenty mu of land and a house. Before, I had nothing, and I often went hungry, taking my whole family everywhere to beg for food." The village head told us, "Because the government needs cotton, we will grow more cotton to fully support our government."

    The lunch we had in the home of a farmer who received land after the land reform deeply expressed the spirit of solidarity of the Chinese people towards international friends. We will always remember this encounter with joy. In this encounter, we saw the lives of Chinese farmers after they had turned over, heard the happy laughter of the farmers, and saw the carefree games of the children. A bright and free life unfolded before them.

    I feel it is my responsibility to say one more thing that we experienced here, which is the Chinese people's heroic struggle to aid the Korean people and their struggle against American imperialist aggression. The Chinese people's deep sympathy for the Korean people is manifested in the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army, determined to drive American imperialism out of Korean territory. This action deeply touched us.

    There are also Chinese women in the Chinese People's Volunteers. I met three female soldiers from the Korean front who returned home to participate in the National Day celebrations at the National Democratic Women's Federation, and they moved me very much.

    Chinese mothers are proud that their children volunteered to fight on Korean soil. All these actions of the Chinese people are due to their knowledge that the struggle in Korea is not only for Korea but also for world peace. The Chinese people's determination to resist America and aid Korea is manifested in their active participation in the donation of airplanes, artillery, and tanks. The 2,482 airplanes donated by the Chinese people prove that the heroic people are determined to defend the freedom they have already gained.

    The people of Lucun Village donated 20 million yuan in three days, which made us feel the Chinese people's determination to resist America and aid Korea. The fact that women in major cities bought 59 airplanes and two tanks also proves the Chinese women's love for their motherland.

    All the unforgettable impressions we have gained here encourage the Hungarian people and Hungarian women. Like the Chinese people and Chinese women, they are also fighters for peace.

    We are very grateful to the Chinese government and the Chinese people for allowing us to stay in China. This will further consolidate the friendship between our two peoples.

    The Hungarian people also love their motherland, freedom, and peace. In our country, just like you, we are working hard for a free and happy life. This great struggle is led by our great Workers' Party and Comrade Rákosi, the beloved leader of the Hungarian people.

    Our people and your people, as well as the progressive people of the world, are marching side by side in the powerful peace camp, which is headed by the great Soviet Union, the first peace fighter, the dear Comrade Stalin.

### 中国抗美援朝运动鼓舞着匈牙利人民

    中国抗美援朝运动鼓舞着匈牙利人民
    匈牙利人民观礼代表团团长  伊斯特万尼·华斯
    编者按：应邀参加我国国庆节的匈牙利人民观礼代表团团长、匈牙利民主妇女联盟总书记伊斯特万尼·华斯，于十月十日赴华东各地参观访问离北京之前，曾应邀在中央人民广播电台演说。该台于十月二十四日播送了她演说的录音，下面是她的演说词的译文。亲爱的朋友们，亲爱的同志们：
    我们带着赞美和羡慕的心情注视着中国人民和中国妇女的生活。我们被邀请来参加的十月一号中国国庆节，表现了中国人民对祖国、对共产党和对伟大的领袖毛泽东的热爱。我们永远不会忘记中国人民军队的严肃的阅兵式和热烈而鲜艳的群众游行。这些都表现出他们的力量和高度的觉悟性。在这次游行当中，我们看见了人民正确地跟随着自己的人民政府，永远不许别人夺取他们已经获得的自由。我们到处看见对男人说来是可贵的同志，并且能和他们一同建设、一同斗争的妇女。对我印象最深的是庆祝六个电车女司机开始工作的大会。英勇的中国妇女们已经证明了自己能够拿着枪杆和自己的丈夫、自己的儿子共同为自由而斗争；现在又证明了：他们在建设自己的祖国当中是和男子平等的。我将永久记住：我乘坐了青年姑娘驾驶的电车。这些青年姑娘们的幸福的微笑似乎是说：“我胜利了，这辆车已经被我掌握了。”
    款待我们的朋友们和同志们，使我们有机会认识到解放了的农民生活。我们被送到鹿圈村，在这里我们看见了幸福的在自己土地上工作的农民们。
    在这个住着四百八十七户人家的乡村里，我们看见了中国的农民如何热爱自己的祖国、共产党和伟大的领袖毛泽东。他们对我们的问题的平凡的回答，是最好的证明。一个有七个孩子的父亲说：“毛泽东给了我土地，我现在很高兴，我有二十亩地和一所房子。从前我什么都没有，常常挨饿，带着全家到处去讨饭。”这个村子的村长向我们说：“因为政府需要棉花，我们就加种棉花，全力支持自己的政府。”
    我们在一位土地改革以后得到土地的农民家里吃的那顿午饭，深刻地表示出中国人民对于国际友人的团结精神。我们永远会带着喜悦的心情来回忆这次的相会。在这次相会当中，我们看见了中国农民翻身以后的生活，听见了农民的幸福的笑声，看见了孩子们无忧无愁的嬉戏。在他们面前展开了光辉自由的生活。
    我觉得自己有责任再说一件我们在这里所体验到的事，就是中国人民援助朝鲜人民的英勇斗争和反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争。中国人民对朝鲜人民的这种深厚的同情心，表现在中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，决心把美帝国主义赶出朝鲜领土这一行动上。这种行动深深地感动了我们。
    在中国人民志愿军里面也有中国妇女。我在全国民主妇联会见了从朝鲜前线回国参加国庆的三位女战士，她们使我非常感动。
    中国的母亲因为自己的孩子自愿到朝鲜的土地上去作战而骄傲。中国人民的这一切行动，是由于他们知道：在朝鲜进行的斗争不仅是为着朝鲜，同时也是为着全世界的和平。中国人民抗美援朝的志愿，表现在他们积极地参加捐献飞机大炮坦克的行动里。中国人民捐献出来的两千四百八十二架飞机证明了英勇的人民有决心保卫已经获得的自由。
    鹿圈村的人民三天之内捐献了两千万元，使我们感觉到中国人民抗美援朝的志愿。各大城市里的妇女买了五十九架飞机和两辆坦克，这件事也证明了中国妇女对自己祖国的热爱。
    我们在这里得到的一切不能忘记的印象，都鼓舞着匈牙利人民和匈牙利妇女。他们也像中国人民和中国妇女一样，是为和平而斗争的战士。
    我们非常感谢中国政府和中国人民让我们在中国逗留。这将进一步巩固我们两国人民之间的友爱。
    匈牙利人民同样热爱自己的祖国、自由与和平，在我们的国家里，也像你们一样，正为着自由幸福的生活而努力斗争。这个伟大的斗争是由我们伟大的工人党和匈牙利人民热爱的领袖拉科西同志领导的。
    我们的人民和你们的人民以及全世界进步的人民并肩地走在强大的和平阵营里，这个阵营是以伟大的苏联第一个和平战士，亲爱的斯大林同志为首的。
