Severely Punish Lawbreakers Who Defraud National Property

奸商 Yang Chudong Executed in Nanjing

The Nanjing People's Court held a public sentencing rally on October 29 to judge the case of the奸商 Yang Chudong and others who colluded to defraud state-owned enterprises of huge loans and endanger national economic construction. The principal offender Yang Chudong was sentenced to death and executed by firing squad after the sentencing rally. Accomplices such as Yang Xiaoxian were sentenced to prison terms of varying lengths according to the severity of their crimes. At the same time, the court also ordered the criminals to be jointly responsible for returning the 3,000 tons of standard coal and 1,082,209 catties of糙米 they had defrauded.

The principal offender Yang Chudong was a consistently speculative奸商. On September 8, 1949, Yang instigated illegal businessman Ying Hongfu to contract with the Jiawang Coal Mine in Shandong in the name of "Xinda Engineering Firm" to undertake the ordering of hardware equipment. However, when the delivery deadline arrived, they owed the mine 6.4 million yuan worth of equipment. On October 10 of the same year, Yang himself, in the name of "Dada Rubber Factory," signed a contract with Jiawang Coal Mine to exchange 13,500 dozen high-top and low-top rubber shoes for 10,000 tons of standard coal. The contract stipulated that Yang Chudong's delivery should not be later than eighty days, and the mine would gradually deliver the standard coal within three months after receiving the rubber shoes. After Yang Chudong provided a guarantor, the mine paid 84 million yuan as the purchase price for 3,000 tons of standard coal to cover the cost of the rubber shoes. Yang used only 10 million yuan to purchase materials with the coal money he received, and diverted the rest for other uses. By November, he had only delivered a few samples. After the mine repeatedly urged him to deliver the goods, Yang continued to play tricks, colluding with Chen Houkun, the manager of Nanjing Yuanchang Paint Shop, and others to guarantee him, delay and perfunctory, deliberately embezzling national property. Until Yang was arrested in May 1950, he had not delivered a single pair of rubber shoes.

In late October 1949, the First Branch of the former Nanjing Trading Corporation (now the Nanjing Branch of the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation), in order to stabilize prices and supply food to the people, mobilized public and private forces to purchase food rice. Yang became utterly insane and set up an even bigger scam to steal national property. Yang gathered a small number of illegal merchants from Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhu and other places to Nanjing, hiding behind the scenes to direct. On November 4, Yang sent his younger brother Yang Xiaoxian and brother-in-law Lin Zhiping to sign contracts with the trading company in the names of Wuhu Xiangtaiyong Rice Mill and Yongfeng Rice Mill respectively, with five store guarantees, to undertake two consignments of糙米 totaling 10,000 shi (1.5 million catties), stating that the delivery would be made on the 9th. The trading company allocated all 286 million yuan of the rice price for 10,000 shi on the afternoon of the same day. After receiving the rice money, Yang and others privately divided the price of more than 4,000 shi of rice with the introducer and guarantor according to the previously agreed-upon distribution method, and rented 18 rooms in the former Nanjing Central Hotel, indulging in drinking and prostitution every day. At the same time, he used 143 million yuan of the rice money for 5,000 shi through Bao Yu Qianzhuang (one of Yang's guarantors) to make secret profits, profiteering, and fueling the price surge at that time. As for the trading company, Yang and others repeatedly requested an extension of the delivery date under the pretext of "rainy weather and ship obstruction." Under the trading company's resolute pursuit, Yang and others only delivered more than 398,000 catties of rice in early January 1950, and then absconded to Shanghai, refusing to meet with the company's urging personnel. Including the rice delivered during the interrogation, Yang and others delivered a total of 417,791 catties of糙米, actually owing 1,082,209 catties.

In May 1950, the Shanghai People's Court accepted the complaint from Jiawang Coal Mine and detained Yang and others for interrogation. In July of the same year, they were sent to the Nanjing People's Court to be tried together with the complaint from the Nanjing Branch of the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation (formerly the First Branch of the Nanjing Trading Corporation). In December of the same year, the Nanjing People's Court sentenced the principal offender Yang Chudong to death, and co-conspirators Yang Xiaoxian and others were sentenced to imprisonment ranging from ten years to six months. The court also ordered the criminals to be jointly responsible for returning the money defrauded from state-owned enterprises. Yang and others appealed against the sentence. The East China Branch of the Supreme People's Court rejected the appeal of Yang and others, upheld the original judgment of the Nanjing People's Court, and ordered its immediate execution.

　　严惩诈骗国家财产的不法分子
    奸商杨锄东已在南京处死刑
    奸商杨锄东等结伙诈骗国营企业巨额贷款、危害国家经济建设的案件，已由南京市人民法院在十月二十九日举行宣判大会判决。主犯杨锄东判处死刑，已在宣判大会后执行枪决；同谋犯杨效先等按罪行轻重分别判处徒刑。同时并判令该犯等共同负责缴回前所诈骗的统煤三千吨、糙米一百零八万二千二百零九斤。
    主犯杨锄东是个一贯投机倒把的奸商。一九四九年九月八日，杨犯主使不法商人应宏甫以“鑫达工程行”名义与山东贾汪煤矿订约，承揽订购五金器材。但到交货期满，却欠下矿方六百四十万元的器材不交。同年十月十日，杨犯本人以“大达橡胶厂”名义，与贾汪煤矿订立以一万三千五百打深统、浅统胶鞋换取统煤一万吨的合同。合同订明杨锄东交货不得迟于八十天，矿方收到胶鞋后陆续在三个月内交清统煤。矿方在杨锄东具保后，即付给统煤三千吨的价款八千四百万元作为购胶费用。杨犯领得煤款，仅以一千万元购买材料，其余款项都挪作他用，到十一月只交了几双样品。经矿方多次催促交货，杨犯仍玩弄花样，串通南京源昌漆庄经理陈候堃等人为其加保，拖延搪塞，蓄意侵吞国家财产。直到一九五零年五月杨犯被捕，始终未交一双胶鞋。
    一九四九年十月下旬，南京前贸易总公司第一分公司（现为中国粮食公司南京分公司）为平稳物价供应民食，动员公私力量采购食米。杨犯竟丧心病狂，布设更大骗局以盗窃国家财产。杨犯纠集上海、南京、芜湖等地的少数不法商人来到南京，自己藏在幕后指挥。十一月四日，杨犯派他的胞弟杨效先和妹夫林治平分别用芜湖祥泰永记米厂和永丰米厂的名义，并具五家店保，与贸易公司订约承办糙米两宗共一万石（一百五十万斤），言明九日交货。贸易公司在当天下午便将一万石米价款二亿八千六百万元全数拨给。杨犯等领得米款后，即按照事前商定的分肥办法，与介绍人、保人将四千多石米的价款私自分用，并在前南京中央饭店赁住十八个房间，天天酗酒狎妓。他同时又以五千石米款一亿四千三百万元通过保余钱庄（杨犯的保人之一）拆放暗息，牟取暴利，助长了当时的物价涨风。对于贸易公司，杨犯等则藉口“天雨船阻”，一再要求展期交货。在贸易公司坚决追索下，杨犯等仅在一九五零年一月上旬交米三十九万八千多斤，随即潜匿上海，拒绝再与公司催货人员见面。连同后来审讯期间追交的计算在内，杨犯等共交糙米四十一万七千七百九十一斤，实欠一百零八万二千二百零九斤。
    一九五零年五月，上海市人民法院接受贾汪煤矿控告，将杨犯等羁押审讯，同年七月解送南京市人民法院，与中国粮食公司南京分公司（即南京前贸易总公司第一分公司）的控告并案审理。南京市人民法院同年十二月判决主犯杨锄东死刑，共谋犯杨效先等分别判处十年以下、六个月以上徒刑。并判令各犯共同负责缴回从国营企业骗去的款项，杨犯等不服上诉。最高人民法院华东分院驳回杨犯等的上诉，维持南京市人民法院原判，并令立即执行。
