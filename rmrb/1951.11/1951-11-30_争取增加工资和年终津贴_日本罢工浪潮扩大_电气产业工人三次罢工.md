    Striving for Increased Wages and Year-End Bonuses
    Japanese Strike Wave Expands
    Electrical Industry Workers Strike Three Times
   [Xinhua News Agency, 28th Dispatch from Tokyo] Japanese workers, in order to improve their harsh living conditions, continue to launch strike struggles, striving for increased wages and year-end bonuses.
    Following two strikes on November 17th and 20th, members of the Japanese Electrical Industry Workers' Union, persisting in their demand for increased wages, held another twelve-hour strike on the 24th. This strike caused "Japan's electricity generation, already feeling the pinch of insufficient supply, to decrease by nearly 20 percent on the 24th." (Guoxin News Agency)
    Simultaneous with the workers' strike, 120,000 staff members in the electrical industry sector also launched a work slowdown.
    The wave of strikes has expanded to government agencies. Staff members of the Ministry of Labor, in order to demand year-end bonuses, began a sit-down strike on the 21st. The authorities of the Ministry of Labor brutally used the police to suppress the strikers.
    The National Railway Workers' Union, with approximately 400,000 members, called on its members to implement a sit-down strike starting on November 20th. After three days of struggle, the railway authorities were forced to agree to the workers' demand for a year-end bonus of 5,000 yen. The strike was declared over on the morning of the 23rd.

    电气产业工人三次罢工
   【新华社二十八日讯】东京消息：日本工人为了改善恶劣的生活条件，继续展开罢工斗争，争取增加工资和年终津贴。
    坚持增加工资要求的日本电气产业工人工会的会员在十一月十七日和二十日两次举行罢工之后，又在二十四日举行了十二小时的罢工。这次罢工使“已感供应不足的日本发电量，在二十四日减少了将近百分之二十”。（国新社）
    与工人罢工同时，电气产业部门的十二万名职员，也举行了怠工斗争。
    罢工的浪潮已扩大到政府机关。劳动省的工作人员为了要求年终津贴，从二十一日开始举行静坐罢工。劳动省当局曾横暴地使用警察镇压罢工者。
    拥有会员约四十万人的国营铁道工人工会，号召它的会员们自十一月二十日开始实行静坐罢工。经过三天的斗争，铁道当局被迫答应了工人关于发给年终津贴五千日元的要求。罢工已在二十三日上午宣告结束。
