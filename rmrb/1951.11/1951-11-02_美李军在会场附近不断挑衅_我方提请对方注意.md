    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 1st. At the meeting of the Joint Liaison Office of both sides held on the afternoon of October 31st, our liaison officer, Senior Colonel Zhang Chunshan, notified the other side's liaison officer, Kenney, face-to-face: To prevent irresponsible elements from disrupting the Panmunjom conference area, our side has advanced troops to our original positions on the west bank of the Sachon River. Prior to this, Colonel Kenney had notified our side on October 22nd that the other side's troops had advanced their forces to the east bank of the Sachon River for the aforementioned purpose. The Sachon River is located hundreds of meters east of Panmunjom and flows south into the Imjin River. At the meeting, Senior Colonel Zhang Chunshan mentioned in passing that in recent days, the other side's troops have continuously attacked and shelled areas west of the Sachon River near the conference area, and asked the other side to pay attention. During the meeting on the 31st, the rumbling of artillery fire could still be clearly heard at the Panmunjom conference venue.
    In recent days, the U.S. side's representatives have been insisting on the absurd demand that the U.S. and ROK troops occupy the Kaesong area within the sub-group meetings. In the area near the conference venue, the Rhee's puppet army, disregarding the fact that the conference area is nearby, openly engages in military provocations. This situation cannot but arouse serious attention.

    美李军在会场附近不断挑衅
    我方提请对方注意
    【新华社开城一日电】在十月三十一日下午举行的双方联络官联合办事处的会议上，我方联络官张春山上校当面通知对方联络官肯尼：为了防止不负责分子扰乱板门店会场区，我方已将部队推进到砂川河西岸我方原有阵地。在这之前，肯尼上校曾在十月二十二日通知我方：对方部队为了上述目的将其部队推进到砂川河东岸。砂川河位于板门店以东数百米处，由北向南流入临津江。张春山上校在会上附带提到最近几天以来，对方部队不断袭击和炮轰会场区附近砂川河以西的地方，并提请对方注意。在三十一日会议进行中，板门店会场上仍清晰地听到隆隆的炮声。
    这几天来，美方代表在小组会内一直坚持由美李军占领开城区域的荒谬要求。在会场附近地区，李伪军不顾会场区就在附近的事实，公然进行军事挑衅，这种情况不能不引起人们严重的注意。
