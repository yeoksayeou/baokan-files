　　Zhao Shirong, a Cadre of the Tongxian Special District Cooperative

    Should Not Have Sold Diseased Cattle Along the Way in Suiyuan

    Editor: In early September of this year, the Tongxian Special District Cooperative of Hebei Province sent personnel to Suiyuan Province to purchase a large number of draft cattle. Among them, 251 head of cattle were driven back to Tongxian from Shanba Town in Suiyuan Province via land route. When they arrived at Daoshi Village in Guisui County, cattle plague broke out. At that time, Comrade Zhao Shirong of the cooperative not only failed to report to the epidemic prevention authorities and the local government, but also sold 54 head of sick and dead cattle along the way in order to reduce the cooperative's losses. After the Second District Office of Longsheng County, Suiyuan Province, discovered this situation, the Second Team of Veterinary Disease Prevention of the Animal Husbandry Bureau of Suiyuan Province took emergency measures to isolate or treat the dead and sick cattle, and the remaining cattle were preserved. The spread of the virus in the areas through which this group of cattle passed caused losses to the people's property. In addition to manpower, Suiyuan Province spent nearly 20 million yuan on preventive medicines alone. We believe that Comrade Zhao Shirong's actions were very wrong. A revolutionary cadre should not simply consider the interests of his own department without regard to the interests of the masses and the overall interests of the country. Therefore, we suggest that the Tongxian Special District Cooperative should punish Comrade Zhao Shirong.

　　通县专区合作社干部赵士荣
    不应在绥远沿途变卖疫牛
    编辑同志：本年九月初旬，河北省通县专区合作社派员来绥远省购买大批耕牛。其中二百五十一头牛是从绥远省陕坝镇经由陆路赶回通县，行至归绥县道什村时发生了牛瘟。当时该社赵士荣同志不但未向防疫机关及当地政府报告，而且将病牛与死牛沿路变卖了五十四头，以减少该社损失。这一情况被绥远省龙胜县第二区公所发觉后，经过绥远省畜牧局兽疫防治第二队采取紧急措施，对死牛、对病牛隔离或治疗，所余牛只才得以保全。这群牛所经各地，病毒传播，使人民财产受到损失。绥远省除人力外，只是防治药品费，就用去了近两千万元。我们认为赵士荣同志的这种作法，是非常错误的。一个革命干部不应该单纯为了本部门的利益，而不顾群众的利益和国家的整体利益。因此，我们建议通县专区合作社对赵士荣同志应给以处分。
