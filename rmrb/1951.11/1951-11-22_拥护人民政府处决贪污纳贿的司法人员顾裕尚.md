    Supporting the People's Government's Execution of Corrupt and Bribe-Taking Judicial Personnel Gu Yushang
    Editor: The Beijing People's Court sentenced Gu Yushang, an employee of the Supreme People's Court, to death for corruption and bribery (as reported in this newspaper on November 12th). We express our firm support.
    The Beijing People's Court's judgment in this case makes everyone deeply realize that the people's judicial organs are truly implementing the people's will. At the same time, this fact also tells us that individual former judicial personnel with corrupt and degenerate behaviors, who have infiltrated the people's judicial organs, are affecting the prestige of the people's judicial organs. This is a matter worthy of attention. We are the future judicial workers of New China, and we must strengthen our political and ideological training, resolutely fight against corruption and degeneration, and strive for the purity of the people's judicial organs and the consolidation of the people's legal system!

    Editor: I fully support the People's Government's correct measure in sentencing Gu Yushang to death for serious corruption and bribery.
    The People's Court is an organ that serves the people, and it must not allow bad elements who violate the law to exist. Scum like Gu, should not be allowed to take on any work in the people's agencies and groups, especially in the people's judicial organs.
    What particularly moved me in this matter was the action of Liu Bingsheng, a student at Fu Jen Catholic University, who voluntarily wrote a letter exposing this case. This action is worthy of our learning.
                                                                        Xu Degui

    拥护人民政府处决贪污纳贿的司法人员顾裕尚
    编辑同志：北京市人民法院判处最高人民法院贪污纳贿的职员顾裕尚以死刑（消息见十一月十二日本报），我们表示坚决拥护。
    北京市人民法院对这一案件的判决，使大家深切地体验到人民司法机关是真正执行人民意志的。同时，这件事实也告诉了我们：个别混入人民司法机关中的有贪污腐化行为的旧司法人员，正在影响着人民司法机关的威信。这是值得注意的事情。我们是新中国未来的司法工作者，我们一定要加强政治、思想锻炼，要坚决与贪污腐化的现象进行斗争，为人民司法机关的纯洁和人民法制的巩固而奋斗！中国人民大学本科法律系学生　时伟超

    编辑同志：顾裕尚因严重的贪污纳贿行为被判处死刑，我完全拥护人民政府的这一正确措施。
    人民法院是为人民服务的机关，一定不能允许有知法犯法的坏分子存在。像顾犯这样的败类，是不能在人民机关、团体中，特别是在人民司法机关中担任任何工作的。
    在这个问题上使我特别感动的，是辅仁大学同学刘炳生自动写信揭发这一案件的行动。这种行动是值得我们学习的。  许德贵
