　　Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government Convenes National Conference of Engineering Institute Presidents
    Drafts Plan for Adjusting Higher Industrial Education Departments and Systems Next Year
    In order to meet the needs of national construction, develop higher industrial education in a planned way, and cultivate a large number of senior industrial technology construction talents, the 1952 plan for adjusting higher industrial education departments and systems has been drafted at the National Conference of Engineering Institute Presidents convened by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government and will be submitted to the Government Administration Council for approval and implementation.
    The National Conference of Engineering Institute Presidents, held from November 3rd to 9th, studied the current serious situation in which higher industrial education, both in quantity and quality, is far from meeting the needs of national industrial construction. There are currently 42 engineering institutes, 6 universities with engineering departments, and 17 industrial vocational schools in the country. Engineering institute students number 33,880, and vocational and specialized course students number over 9,000, totaling over 42,000. The number of students is far from meeting the increasingly urgent needs of national industrial construction. At the same time, most of these schools suffer from dispersed talent and uneconomical use of equipment. The 42 engineering institutes, 6 universities with engineering departments, and 17 industrial vocational schools offer 42 types of departments and 44 types of vocational and specialized courses. Due to the complexity of the departments and courses, the talents cultivated by these schools cannot be specialized enough. Therefore, the current organization and division of labor of higher industrial schools and departments urgently need appropriate adjustments.
    At the meeting, Ma Xulun, Minister of Education of the Central People's Government, emphasized that higher industrial education must be uniformly arranged, focus on division of labor, and be adjusted so that the national engineering institutes can cultivate more and better industrial construction cadres. He also emphatically put forward a new direction for the development of engineering institutes and called on everyone to pay attention to various specialized courses. He said: Specialized course students have a short study period, and as long as they are taught practically, they can meet objective urgent needs. In the future, more than half of the new students enrolled in engineering institutes should be specialized course students.
    Vice Minister Qian Junrui gave clear instructions at the meeting on the principles of adjusting engineering institutes. He pointed out that this adjustment of departments and systems and reform of the system must, first, adopt the policy of combining long-term training with short-term training, with short-term training as the focus within five to ten years this year. Second, the situation of dispersed teachers and equipment must be changed to concentrate human and material resources and use them rationally. Third, the departments and courses set up by various colleges and universities should meet the actual needs of industrial construction and be more specialized. Fourth, adhere to the principle of economy and oppose waste. After the adjustment of various colleges and universities, it is impossible to expand greatly immediately, but for the housing and necessary equipment that must be built to increase students, it is also necessary to be simple and practical. Fifth, strengthen the political and ideological leadership of engineering institutes. He called on everyone to run industrial education with revolutionary spirit and revolutionary methods. He Changgong, Vice Minister of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government, and Liu Lanbo, Vice Minister of Fuel Industry, also attended the meeting and spoke. They hoped that in higher industrial education, the potential of engineering institutes should be brought into play, and a large number of industrial construction cadres should be trained on the existing basis; they also expressed their willingness to provide as much assistance as possible to engineering institutes in terms of equipment and student internships.
    The presidents of various engineering institutes and representatives of the education departments of major administrative regions attending the meeting, after in-depth discussions, unanimously agreed to the 1952 plan for adjusting higher industrial education departments and systems proposed by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government; and reached a consensus on the principle of focusing on short-term training in the next five to ten years for the development of higher industrial education. The implementation of the 1952 plan for adjusting higher industrial education departments and systems will focus on North China, East China, and Central South China.
    After learning about the adjustment plan, all the faculty members of the Engineering Department of Peking University wrote a letter to Minister Ma Xulun of the Ministry of Education on the 5th. In the letter, they stated: All the faculty members of our Peking University Engineering Department are united and willing to overcome all difficulties, implement the decision of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government well, and strive for higher achievements and a bright future in higher education. The Tsinghua University Committee of the Chinese Education Trade Union also sent a letter to the Ministry of Education and forwarded it to Chairman Mao, expressing that they would regard this decision as their own wishes and decisions, as a glorious political task assigned by Chairman Mao, and wholeheartedly implement and execute it.

### 中央人民政府教育部召开全国工学院院长会议  拟定明年高等工业教育院系调整方案

　　中央人民政府教育部召开全国工学院院长会议
    拟定明年高等工业教育院系调整方案
    为了适应国家建设需要，有计划地发展高等工业教育，大量培养高级工业技术建设人才，一九五二年高等工业教育院系调整方案，已经在中央人民政府教育部召开的全国工学院院长会议中拟定，将提交政务院批准实施。
    在十一月三日到九日举行的全国工学院院长会议，研究了目前高等工业教育在数量上和质量上都远不能适应国家工业建设的严重情况。全国现有工学院四十二所，设有工程系科的大学六所，工业专科学校十七所，工学院学生三万三千八百八十人，专科和专修科学生九千余人，共四万二千余人。学生人数远不能适应国家工业建设日益迫切的需要。同时，这些学校大部分人才分散，设备的使用也不很经济。四十二所工学院、六所设有工程系科的大学、十七所工业专科学校中，分设有四十二种系和四十四种专科和专修科。由于系科庞杂，这些学校所培养的人才，也不能专精。因此，目前高等工业学校院系的设置与分工，急需作适当的调整。
    中央人民政府教育部马叙伦部长在会议上强调指出，高等工业教育必须统一布置，重点分工，进行调整，使全国工学院能培养出更多更好的工业建设干部。他并着重提出了发展工学院的新的方向，号召大家重视各种专修科。他说：专修科学生修业年限短，只要教得能切合实用，就能应客观的急需。今后工学院招收的新生，应有二分之一以上是专修科学生。
    钱俊瑞副部长在会议上对工学院调整的原则，作了明确的指示。他指出这次调整院系和改革制度，第一，必须采取长期培养与短期训练相结合的方针，今年五年到十年内以短期训练为重点。第二，师资设备分散的情况，必须改变，以集中人力物力，合理使用。第三，要求各院校所设系科应切合工业建设实际需要，更加专门化。第四，遵守节约原则，反对浪费。各院校调整以后，不可能立即大事扩充，但为了因增加学生而必须增建的房屋和必要的设备，亦须因陋就简，朴实合用。第五，加强工学院的政治思想领导。他号召大家要用革命的精神和革命的办法来办工业教育。中央人民政府重工业部何长工副部长、燃料工业部刘澜波副部长，都到会讲话。他们希望在高等工业教育中，要发挥工学院的潜在力，在现有基础上，大量培养工业建设干部；他们并表示对工学院在设备和学生实习方面，尽量予以帮助。
    出席会议的各工学院院长和各大行政区教育部代表等，经过深入的讨论，一致同意了中央教育部所提出的一九五二年高等工业教育院系调整方案；并对高等工业教育发展的方针，今后五年到十年以短期训练为重点的原则，取得了一致的认识。一九五二年高等工业教育院系调整方案的执行，将以华北区、华东区和中南区为重点。
    北京大学工学院全体教员，得悉该项调整方案后，在五日写信给教育部马叙伦部长。他们在信中表示：我们北大工学院全体教员团结一致，愿意克服一切困难，很好地贯彻中央人民政府教育部的这个决定，为高等教育更高的成就及远大前途而奋斗。中国教育工会清华大学委员会也致函教育部并转毛主席，表示要将这个决定当作自己的愿望和决定，当作毛主席交给的一件光荣的政治任务，全心全意地贯彻和执行。
