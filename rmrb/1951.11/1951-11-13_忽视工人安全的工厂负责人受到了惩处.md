　　Factory Heads Punished for Neglecting Worker Safety
    To the Editor: The Shanghai People's Court sentenced Xu Bingxi and Lu Jine, the heads of the Shanghai Dazhong Dyestuff Factory, to imprisonment on October 10 for neglecting worker safety and causing an explosion.
    The main production departments of the Dazhong Dyestuff Factory are the "Vulcanization" and "Nitration" departments. From April 19 to 21, when the Nitration Department of the factory was manufacturing picric acid, the technician instructed workers to use iron bars to clear the output pipe and to strike it with iron hammers because the material could not be discharged. The picric acid in the pot immediately exploded violently upon impact. As a result, most of the factory buildings were destroyed, and ten people, including the technician and workers, were killed on the spot, and five others were seriously injured. According to the investigation, the factory has consistently neglected worker safety. Therefore, the explosion was not accidental. The verdict of the People's Court has been warmly supported by the working people.

　　忽视工人安全的工厂负责人受到了惩处
    编辑同志：上海市人民法院，于十月十日对忽视工人安全因而发生爆炸事件的上海大中染料厂负责人许炳熙和路季讷，分别判处徒刑。
    大中染料厂的主要生产部门是“加硫”和“硝化”两部。四月十九日至二十一日该厂硝化部制造苦味酸时，因放不出料子，技术员让工人用铁条通输出管，并用铁锤敲击，锅内苦味酸受撞击后，立即发生猛烈爆炸。结果，除该厂厂房大部被毁外，当场炸死者有技术员和工人共十名，其他五名身受重伤。据调查，该厂一贯不关心工人的安全，所以，此次爆炸案的发生，并不是什么偶然的事。人民法院的判处，获得劳动人民热烈拥护。
