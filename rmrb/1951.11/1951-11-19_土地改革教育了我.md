　　Land Reform Educated Me
　　Vice Dean of Peking University Medical College Wu Chao Ren

　　Cultivating Myself in Class Struggle

　　Before participating in land reform, I had read some relevant documents, but my understanding of the tasks and objectives of land reform was always vague. I thought land reform was just a good way to solve the problem of farmers' lives and improve the rural economy. Therefore, my purpose in participating in land reform was also unclear. Why should a medical worker and educator participate in land reform? What role can participating in land reform play for him? Is it a waste of time and money? I couldn’t figure out these questions in my mind at the time. To be honest, my initial idea of participating in land reform was very simple, and probably very naive: I thought it was a pity that I hadn't participated in revolutionary work in the past, and now I wanted to seize this opportunity to fight against the feudal forces to make up for this shortcoming. I didn't think about the real meaning of land reform at the time. After starting work, I realized that land reform is not simply about distributing land from an economic perspective, but a vigorous and earth-shattering peasant movement, a fierce class struggle, and the establishment of a people's democratic dictatorship in rural areas. Because the feudal landlord class was defeated, because the peasants participated in the government, and because the rural economy was liberated and productivity was improved, our country's industrialization had conditions, and our people were able to consolidate and develop the fruits of revolutionary victory and realize New Democracy. Because I saw that land reform was a movement of this nature, I clearly realized that land reform is not only a problem for farmers, but also a common problem for all classes of people in the country under the leadership of the Common Program. We intellectuals should regard land reform work as our own task, because our Common Program requires us to do so. We have an obligation to assist the peasants with all our strength in their emancipation, and we have even more obligation to cultivate and transform ourselves through actual struggle, so that we can better serve the people in our work positions.

　　Strengthening My Revolutionary Standpoint

　　Although I came from a middle-peasant family, I left rural life at an early age. In my memory, only impressions of the hard lives and simple qualities of the peasants remained. I have always despised and hated landlords because they are all so stingy and love money so much. But since I had never personally been oppressed and exploited by them, there was no question of hating them. During the land reform work, I visited many poor peasants and farm laborers, listened to their complaints, saw them living like cattle and horses, and participated in more than a dozen struggle meetings. I saw the stubbornness, cunning, and denial of the landlords. Only then did I clearly realize the landlords’ cruel exploitation and oppression of the peasants, and their various economic and political crimes. The peasant brothers’ fierce struggle against the landlords and the clear distinction between the enemy and us strengthened my revolutionary standpoint and strengthened my hatred and will to struggle against the landlord class. Therefore, emotionally, I easily and naturally bonded with the peasants. The peasants were so kind, straightforward, and frank with us. On the streets, in the fields, and in their homes, the peasants greeted us warmly. In the evening, when we returned home late at night from meetings in the village, the peasant militia would always send us to the town before they felt at ease. These expressions of class friendship deeply moved me and strengthened my will to serve the people.

　　Overcoming Transcendental Political Thought

　　I strengthened my revolutionary standpoint in the struggle, and at the same time, I completely changed my views. Generally speaking, scientific workers, especially medical workers, have more or less transcendental political thought and supra-class viewpoints in the past. They all have thoughts such as "scholarship for scholarship's sake," "scholars can ignore politics," "technology is above all else," "doctors just treat diseases, diseases do not distinguish between classes and have no political nature, so doctors can ignore politics," and so on. I myself was naturally no exception. Although I have always opposed using medical skills to exploit and get rich, and I have hated "extortionist" doctors, I have never made it clear who medical workers serve. In a class society, under the rule of the reactionary government, medical facilities are for the convenience of a small number of wealthy people and the ruling class, not for the welfare of the broad masses of people. Medical facilities and medical personnel are concentrated in cities. The quality of service depends on the price. I didn't realize the reasons for these phenomena in the past. I didn't face up to this issue either. After liberation, I had the opportunity to study and established new viewpoints. I realized that medical workers should be responsible for serving the broad masses of people. Last year, the Central Ministry of Health determined the policy of facing workers, peasants, and soldiers. I think it is correct, and I sincerely support it. These understandings were still somewhat rational for me and were not combined with practice. This time, in the relatively poor rural areas of Sichuan, I personally saw the lack of rural health work and the peasants’ urgent need for medicine. I had to admit that our medical workers had not fulfilled our due responsibilities. In the village where I worked, the infant mortality rate last year was about 250, and many also suffered from umbilical cord infection. In addition, malaria, scabies, hookworm disease, ascariasis, and various other infectious diseases are also very common. The average peasant does not know how infectious diseases occur. They have never even heard of the most common malaria being transmitted by mosquitoes. It can be seen how important it is to instill sanitary common sense in rural areas. In the past, the peasants lived a life of "working hard all day long without getting enough to eat," so of course they didn't have the time or the mood to think about hygiene. The landlords only cared about exploiting and enriching themselves, so how could they think of ways for the peasants? They live in big houses, eat well, and wear warm clothes, so they rarely get sick. Even if they do get sick, they can sit on a sedan chair to the city or ask a doctor to come to their home for treatment. Isn't that convenient? They have plenty of money. In this kind of society, can you say that doctors have no class nature? If the feudal forces are not overthrown, doctors will not be able to develop in China. If medical workers do not serve the broad masses of people, new medicine will not be able to take root and develop in China.

　　Affirming New Views on Medical Education

　　Because of the urgent need of the broad masses of peasants for medicine, in the two and a half months of rural work, not only did I personally solve some medical problems for the peasants, but the other comrades of the land reform work team also used some of the medicines they brought for their own use to do a lot of treatment work, and they did it very appropriately and were very popular among the peasants. Sometimes I am not as popular as them, because when I see a patient, I always like to consider and study many aspects, thinking about this possibility and that possibility, which is not as simple, pertinent, and straightforward as "non-doctors." This shows the high lack and urgent need for rural medical personnel. It also shows that to solve the current medical problems in rural areas, there is no need for very high-level talents, but a large number of intermediate and junior medical workers are needed. Therefore, during the land reform process, in conversations with comrades, I often reviewed my own views on medical education. I remember that in the past at Peking Union Medical College and Peking University before liberation, I strongly advocated improving the level of medicine, opposed reducing the length of study, and even advocated that medical colleges should only accept graduates from university science departments. My reasoning was that human life is precious, medical skills are profound, and medical students need long-term training and study to be competent. This kind of thinking is ostensibly "grand and upright," but in reality it does not face up to the country's situation and the people's needs. It is unconsciously poisoned by the system of American imperialism such as Johns Hopkins University and Harvard University. It can also be said to be a manifestation of selfish individualism, because I myself studied medicine only after completing university. After liberation, I heard words that I had not heard before, and read books that I had not seen before. My thinking has undergone many changes, and I understand that medicine is for the broad masses of people and for the construction of the motherland. Therefore, last year I strongly advocated changing the seven-year system of Peking University to a five-year system. In the actual work of land reform, I more specifically saw the current needs and future requirements of rural areas. If the health of the peasants is guaranteed, productivity can be improved, and the fruits of the land reform victory can be consolidated and developed. Medical educators must not only run high-level schools well, but also attach great importance to the great development of intermediate and junior schools to meet the needs of national construction.

### 土地改革教育了我

　　土地改革教育了我
    北京大学医学院副院长　吴朝仁
    在阶级斗争中锻炼自己
    在参加土地改革以前，我曾经看过一些有关的文件，但是对于土地改革的任务和目的的认识，总是那么模糊，以为土地改革不过是解决农民生活问题和改善农村经济的好办法。因此，我参加土地改革的目的也不明确。一个医务工作者，教育工作者，为什么要参加土地改革呢？参加土地改革对他能起什么作用呢？是否浪费时间和金钱呢？这些问题当时在我的脑子里总搞不清。老实说，我最初决定参加土地改革的想法是很简单的，恐怕也是很幼稚的；那就是：我认为以往没有参加革命工作是个遗憾，现在要抓住这个机会和封建势力做斗争，借以弥补这个缺点。对于土地改革真正的意义，当时就没去想它。开始工作之后，我才体会到土地改革不是单纯从经济出发来分田，而是轰轰烈烈翻天覆地的农民运动，是剧烈的阶级斗争，是在农村里建立人民民主专政。由于封建地主阶级打垮，由于农民参加了政权，由于农村经济解放，生产力提高，我们国家工业化才有了条件，我国人民才能够巩固和发展革命胜利成果，才能够实现新民主主义。因为看清土地改革是这样性质的运动，我就很清楚地认识了土地改革不但是农民的问题，也是在共同纲领领导下的全国各阶级人民的共同问题。我们知识分子应该把土地改革工作当作自己的任务，因为我们的共同纲领要求我们这样作。我们有义务以全力协助农民搞好翻身工作，更有义务从实际斗争中来锻炼自己，改造自己，因而使我们在工作岗位上能更好地为人民服务。
    坚定了革命立场
    我虽然出身中农家庭，幼年就脱离农村生活，在我记忆里只存留些农民的艰苦生活和纯朴品质的印象。对于地主，我向来是鄙视和讨厌的，因为他们都是那么吝啬那么爱钱如命。但是自己没有亲受到他们的压迫和剥削，就谈不到什么对于他们的仇恨。在土地改革工作当中，访问了许多贫农雇农，听了他们的诉苦，看到他们过着牛马生活，参加了十几次斗争会，看到了地主的顽固、狡猾和抵赖，我才清楚地认识了地主对农民的残酷的剥削和压迫，以及他们在经济上、政治上的种种罪恶。农民弟兄对地主斗争那么剧烈，敌我界线那么分明，这些都坚定了我的革命立场，加强了我对地主阶级的仇恨和斗争意志。因此在情感上我很容易地很自然地和农民结合起来。农民对我们是那么亲切、直率、坦白。在街上，在田野中，在他们的家里农民都是亲热地招呼我们。晚上，我们在村里开会到深夜回家时，农民自卫队总要送我们到镇上才放心。这些阶级友爱的表现，十分感动我，增强了我的为人民服务的意志。
    克服了超政治思想
    我在斗争中坚定了自己的革命立场，同时也彻底改变了自己的观点。一般来说，科学工作者，尤其是医务工作者，在过去多多少少都有超政治思想、超阶级观点，都存在着“为学术而学术”、“学者可以不问政治”、“技术高于一切”、“医生就是治病，病是不分阶级的，没有政治性的，因此医生可以不关心政治”……等等的思想。我本人自然不能例外。虽然我一向反对以医术来剥削致富，曾经痛恨“敲竹杠”的医师，但是究竟医务工作者是为谁服务这一点，以往没弄清楚的。在有阶级的社会里，在反动政府统治下，医学设施是为了少数有钱的人，统治阶级的方便，而不是为广大人民谋福利的。医学设施和医务人员都集中在都市里。服务的优劣是看代价高低，造成这些现象的原因，我以往没有认识。我也没有正视这个问题。解放以后，我有机会学习，建立了新的观点，认识了医务工作者应对广大人民负责服务。去年中央卫生部确定了面向工农兵的政策，我认为是正确的，我诚心诚意地拥护着。这些认识在我多少还是偏于理性的，没有结合到实践中去，这次我在四川比较穷苦的农村中，亲眼看到农村卫生工作缺少的情形，农民对于医药的迫切的需要，我不得不承认我们医务工作者没有尽我们应尽的责任。在我工作的村里去年婴儿死亡是二百五十左右，患脐带风死的也不少。此外，疟疾、疥疮、钩虫病、蛔虫病和其他各种传染病也是很普遍的。一般农民都不知道传染病是怎样发生的，连最常见的疟疾是由蚊子传染的，他们都闻所未闻。可见在农村中灌输卫生常识是多么重要的工作。以往农民过着“劳苦终日不得一饱”的生活，当然没有工夫也没有心思想到卫生。地主只顾剥削自肥，那里肯为农民想办法呢？他们住的是大房，吃的饱，穿的暖，根本就很少得病，即使有病，坐上滑竿到城里，或者请医生到家里诊治，岂不方便，——他们有的是钱。在这种社会里，你能说医生没有阶级性吗？封建势力不打倒，医生在中国也就不能发展。医务工作者不为广大人民服务，新医学在中国也就不能生根发展。
    肯定了对医学教育的新看法
    由于广大农民对医药的迫切需要，所以在两个半月的农村工作中，不但我个人为农民解决了一些医务问题，土地改革工作团的其他同志们也利用为了自用所携带的一些药品做了不少治疗工作，而且做得很恰当，很受农民欢迎。有的时候我还不如他们受欢迎，因为我看到一个病人，总爱多方面考虑、研究，想到这个可能，那个可能，不如“非医生的医生们”之简单中肯，直截了当。这说明了农村医务人员的高度缺乏和需要的迫切。也说明了要解决农村目前的医药问题，并不需要很高深的人材，而要大量的中级和初级医务工作者。因此，我在土地改革过程中和同志们的谈话中，常常检讨我本人对于医学教育的看法。记得过去在北京协和医学院，在解放前的北京大学，我曾经极力主张提高医学水平，反对减少修业年限，甚至主张医学院最好只收大学理科毕业生。我的理由是人命是可贵的，医术是深奥的，医学生须要长期的修养和学习才能胜任。这种思想表面上是“冠冕堂皇”，实际上是不正视国家的情况和人民的需要，是不自觉地中了美帝国主义的什么霍布金大学哈佛大学学制的毒，也可以说是自私的个人主义思想的表现，因为我本人就是读完了大学之后才学医的。解放后，听到了以前听不到的话，读了以前看不到的书，在思想上起了不少变化，了解医学是为广大人民的，是为祖国建设的。因此去年极力主张把北京大学的七年制改为五年制。在土地改革实际工作中，更具体地看到农村目前的需要和今后的要求。农民健康有了保障，生产力才可以提高，土地改革胜利的成果才能巩固和发展。医学教育工作者不但要办好高级学校，更必须重视中级和初级学校的大大发展，来配合祖国建设的需要。
