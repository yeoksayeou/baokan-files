    I am Determined to Mobilize the Masses to Plant More Kenaf
    And Learn Soviet Methods of Raising Pigs and Chickens
    I've lived for forty-seven years, and this trip to Tianjin to visit the North China Urban and Rural Materials Exchange Exhibition really opened my eyes. At the exhibition, there was a Soviet pig that was taller than a table, and it weighed more than 600 catties after being raised for just over a year. There was a chicken that could lay eggs every day of the year, 365 days a year, and the eggs were white and big. There were also tractors and harvesters, which required less effort and yielded greater results, truly a blessing for farmers. I also visited factories and was truly convinced of the great power of the working class. I carefully watched step by step from raw materials to finished products. The machines roared, and the worker comrades were all working hard together. It was truly collective and united. Without one part, the finished product could not be produced. Like us farmers, each planting our own small plot of land, minding our own business, our production is backward and our horizons are narrow, simply incomparable. In the future, our rural areas must establish collective farms, using tractors and harvesters for farming, and learn from our worker comrades.
    In the past, city people looked down on us, but now the city masses treat us like family. This is all thanks to the good leadership and education of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. After returning to Tuoketuo County, Suiyuan, I told the farmers everything I had seen and heard, urging everyone to work hard in production and improve production technology. In the past, not many of us grew kenaf. In the future, I will mobilize the masses to plant more kenaf to supply raw materials to urban industries. I think as long as our workers and peasants are united, the construction of the new China will be guaranteed. I am even more grateful to Chairman Mao. Without his leadership in helping the poor to stand up, where would an old poor woman like me be today? After returning home, I framed the gift I received from the exhibition – a picture of Chairman Mao – and hung it squarely on the wall. This winter, I will participate in the land reform work, organize women to collectively engage in sideline occupations, learn Soviet methods of raising pigs and chickens, and collectively participate in land reclamation and production to build a new Suiyuan.

    我决心发动群众多种洋麻
    并学习苏联喂猪养鸡的办法
    我活了四十七岁了，这回到天津参观华北区城乡物资交流展览会，才算真是开了眼界。展览会上有一种苏联的猪长得比桌子还高，只喂养了一年多，就有六百多斤重；有一种鸡，一年三百六十五天都能下蛋，那蛋又白又大；还有拖拉机、收割机，费力小，收效大，真是农民的福音。我还参观了工厂，真正信服了工人阶级的伟大力量。我从原料到成品一步步仔细看过，机器轰隆隆地响着，工人老大哥一齐紧张地干着，真是集体的、团结的，少了那一部分也出不了成品。像咱农民，各自种着一亩三分地，自顾自，生产落后，眼界狭窄，简直比不上。将来咱农村一定要建立集体农场，用拖拉机、收割机耕作，向工人老大哥看齐。
    过去城里人瞧不起咱，现在城里群众对咱像一家人一样，这都是共产党毛主席领导和教育得好。回到绥远托克托县后，我把所见所闻都向农民们讲了，叫大家努力生产，改进生产技术。过去我们种洋麻的不多，以后我可要发动群众多种洋麻，供给城市工业原料。我想只要咱工农团结好，新中国的建设就有保障。我更要感谢毛主席，没有他领导穷人翻身，我一个穷老婆子那有今天？回家后我把展览会送我的礼物——毛主席的像片，用镜框装起来，端端正正挂在墙上。今冬我要参加土地改革工作，把妇女们组织起来，集体搞副业，学习苏联喂猪养鸡的办法；还要集体参加开荒生产，建设新绥远。　绥远托克托县妇女　段文花
