    Zhangjiakou Railway Factory Leading Cadres
    Disregard Reasonable Suggestions from Workers
    To the Editor: The administrative leadership of the Zhangjiakou Railway Factory of the Tianjin Railway Administration suffers from serious bureaucratic working styles. They do not value reasonable suggestions, which has led to a monthly decline in the number of reasonable suggestions offered. For example, the Railway Administration approved Wang Yongshou's suggestion for a spring coiling machine for trial production in January of this year, but the work order has not been issued to this day. Lu Peiyuan and others suggested in March the creation of a machine to make flat oil boxes for locomotives, which the Railway Administration has also approved for trial production, but work has not yet begun. The Trade Union's Rationalization Proposals Committee has repeatedly requested the factory director, the head of the production planning section, and others to include rationalization proposals in the monthly production plan, but the response has always emphasized that the locomotive tasks are too busy and there is no time to consider the trial production of rationalization proposals. In addition, the administrative side is not timely in reviewing and answering workers' reasonable suggestions. For example, the workers' suggestions in August and September have not yet been reviewed or decided. This situation seriously affects the enthusiasm of workers to make reasonable suggestions. According to statistics, sixty reasonable suggestions were received in April, but only nine were received in September.

    张家口铁路工厂领导干部
    忽视职工所提合理化建议
    编辑同志：天津铁路管理局张家口铁路工厂行政领导方面官僚主义作风严重，对合理化建议不重视，因而发生了合理化建议逐月下降的现象。比如王永寿所建议的卷圆簧机，铁路管理局在今年一月就批准试作，但到现在还未发下工单；卢培元等在三月份建议的造机车扁油盒压机，已经铁路管理局批准试作，也至今仍未开工。工会合理化建议委员会曾连续向该厂厂长、生产计划股长等要求把合理化建议编入每月生产计划中去，可是，得到的回答总强调机车任务太忙，无暇顾及合理化建议的试作。此外，行政方面对职工合理化建议的审核与解答也是不及时的，如八、九月份的职工建议到现在仍未审核或决定。这种情况，严重地影响了工人们提合理化建议的积极性，据统计，四月份收到合理化建议六十件，到九月份只有九件了。
