Xinhua News Agency Special Correspondent Reports:

    The U.S. Scheme to Delay the Korean Armistice Negotiations is Bound to Fail

    [Kaesong, November 17th, New China News Agency] Our special correspondent reports: The U.S. side's contradictory and capricious rogue attitude in determining the military demarcation line has nakedly exposed the U.S. imperialists' sinister plot to indefinitely delay the armistice negotiations. The U.S.'s current absurd insistence on refusing to specifically determine the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone not only fundamentally violates the agreement reached by both sides on the second agenda item on July 26th, but also completely contradicts the U.S.'s consistent stance.

    In fact, from July 26th, when the discussion of the military demarcation line began, until November 5th, the U.S. had consistently agreed with and advocated for immediately and specifically determining the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone.

    On July 24th, the then U.S. Secretary of Defense Marshall issued a statement saying: If "discussions begin on the content of an armistice agreement, an agreement must be reached stipulating a military line that (U.S. forces) can defend in the event of renewed hostilities." On July 27th, the U.S. proposed a plan called "Establishing a Demarcation Line Along the Current Battle Line," which actually penetrated our positions, and submitted a map to us delineating the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone according to this plan. A United Press dispatch from Tokyo on July 29th admitted: "Joy and his delegation insisted on their demand" to immediately "delineate the military demarcation line and establish a demilitarized zone" according to their plan. On August 6th, Ridgway Headquarters issued another statement saying: "As the Secretary of Defense stated at a Pentagon press conference on July 24th, the United Nations Command delegation participating in the Kaesong armistice negotiations insists on the principle that in order to reach a solid armistice agreement, an agreement must be reached on a military line that (U.S. forces) will be able to defend in the event of renewed hostilities."

    The U.S. refused our fair and reasonable proposal to take the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line for the armistice and insisted on their unreasonable plan to push the demarcation line 12,000 square kilometers into our territory. At that time, the military demarcation line and demilitarized zone that the U.S. advocated for specific delineation were based on this absurd plan. Due to our exposure and rejection, the U.S. plan was finally declared bankrupt. Subsequently, due to our efforts, just as an agreement on the military demarcation line issue was about to be reached, the U.S., facing various domestic and foreign difficulties, feared a quick armistice. Therefore, it created a series of provocative incidents in the neutral zone, forcing the negotiations to be interrupted for nearly two months. Under the pressure of the failure of the U.S.'s new military adventure and world public opinion, the U.S. was forced to resume negotiations with us.

    After the resumption of negotiations, although the U.S. had to revise its demands to push the military demarcation line deep into our territory, it proposed a new plan on October 25th to attempt to occupy our Kaesong area, and submitted a map to us delineating the military demarcation line according to this plan, advocating for the immediate and specific determination of the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone. U.S. spokesperson Nuckols told reporters on the same day: "Delineating the demarcation line along the middle of the (U.S.-proposed) buffer zone is completely appropriate." When U.S. representative Hodge of the subcommittee made this suggestion, he said that the military demarcation line that the U.S. advocated for immediate delineation "embodies the first requirement of a military armistice." On October 27th, an Associated Press dispatch from Panmunjom also admitted: "The Allied representatives insist on the demand to delineate the ceasefire line."

    The U.S.'s plan to immediately delineate the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone, nominally "generally along the line of combat contact," actually required us to unilaterally withdraw 1,500 square kilometers and "adjust" Kaesong under U.S. control. From October 26th to November 4th, for ten days, our representatives solemnly rejected this absurd plan of the U.S. Our representatives made great efforts to dispel all of the other side's excuses, successively proposing a plan to comprehensively adjust the entire battlefield based on the existing battle line, and a plan to cease fire in place without any adjustments. If the U.S. still has the sincerity to reach an armistice, it should accept our fair and reasonable suggestions so that the military demarcation line issue can be resolved quickly. However, the U.S., seeing that its plan to use negotiations to occupy our territory had failed, and that its policy of delaying negotiations was facing the danger of failure, resorted to desperate measures. On November 5th, it openly proposed in the subcommittee to overturn the agreement between the two sides on the agenda, and, contradictorily, refused to specifically delineate the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone at present, wanting to postpone this work to an indefinite future.

    On November 7th, our side formally proposed a plan for the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone with the content of ceasefire in place. Although the U.S. spokesperson wantonly distorted this plan, even the U.S. International News Service reporter had to admit: "The Communist proposal puts the allies in an awkward position," exposing that it "is the side that wants to continue fighting." The INS reporter said: "There is nothing easier for the people of both sides to understand than this matter." Under these circumstances, in the subcommittee meetings on the 8th and 9th, the U.S. could not raise any reasons to oppose our plan, but repeatedly and shamelessly stated that if the military demarcation line was to be specifically determined, they should accept their plan, re-proposed on November 8th, to "adjust" the Kaesong area under U.S. control, otherwise the U.S. would fundamentally overturn the second agenda item.

    Under our exposure, the U.S. was at a loss for words and simply tore off its mask, openly admitting that the U.S. intentionally wanted to overturn the second agenda item. U.S. spokesperson Nuckols shamelessly said on November 9th: The U.S. "has begun to have doubts" about "the method of establishing a fixed demarcation line," which they themselves agreed to and had vigorously advocated. An Associated Press reporter said: "Nuckols admitted: This shows that the Allied attitude has changed in the past two weeks." Even the Associated Press reporter did not forget that this change on the part of the U.S. was a shameful act of slapping itself in the face, saying: "On October 25th (the very day the ceasefire negotiations resumed), the United Nations Command itself had proposed establishing a temporary buffer zone."

    Based on the above, it can be clearly seen that when the military demarcation line plan is unilaterally beneficial to the U.S. and our side obviously cannot accept it, they advocate for immediately and specifically determining it; and when the plan is fair and reasonable to both sides and can promote an early armistice, but they cannot openly oppose it, they oppose specifically determining it. The U.S. aggressors' adoption of such a contradictory and capricious rogue attitude fully exposes their deliberate conspiracy to delay and obstruct the Korean armistice negotiations in the face of world public opinion. It can be asserted that the U.S.'s policy of delaying negotiations is ultimately doomed to failure.

    美方拖延朝鲜停战谈判的阴谋终必失败
    【新华社开城十七日电】本社特派记者报道：美国方面在确定军事分界线问题上所采取的前后矛盾、反复无常的无赖态度，赤裸裸地暴露了美帝国主义企图无限期拖延停战谈判的罪恶阴谋。美方目前所坚持的拒绝具体确定军事分界线和非军事区的荒谬主张，不仅根本违反双方在七月二十六日达成的关于第二项议程的协议，而且也和美方历来的主张完全矛盾。
    事实上，自从七月二十六日开始讨论军事分界线问题以后，直到十一月五日，美方是一贯同意而且主张立即具体确定军事分界线和非军事区的。
    七月二十四日，美国当时的国防部长马歇尔曾发表声明说：如果“开始讨论一个停战协定的内容，则必须取得协议，规定一条一旦敌对行为重新发生时（美军）能够防守的军事线。”七月二十七日，美方提出了名为“沿目前战线建立分界线”而实际上却深入我方阵地的方案，并将按照这一方案划定军事分界线和非军事区的地图交给我方。合众社东京七月二十九日电承认：“乔埃和他的代表团坚持他们的要求”，即要按照他们的方案立即“划定军事分界线并建立非军事区”。八月六日，李奇微总部又发表声明说：“正如国防部长七月二十四日在五角大楼记者招待会上所表示的，参加开城停火谈判的联合国军代表团坚持这样一个原则，即为了达成稳固的停战协定，必须对一条军事战线获致协议，这条战线在一旦战事再起时（美军）将是可以防守的。”
    美方拒绝我方所提出的以三八线为停战军事分界线的公平合理的方案，而坚持他们的使分界线深入我方阵地一万二千方公里的无理方案。当时美方所主张具体划定的军事分界线和非军事区所根据的正是这个荒谬方案。由于我方的揭露和拒斥，美方的方案终于宣告破产。接着，由于我方的努力，正使军事分界线问题可能达成协议时，美方又因内政外交方面种种困难，害怕迅速促成停战，因此就制造
    一连串破坏中立区的挑衅事件，迫使谈判中断了将近两个月。在美方新的军事冒险失败和世界舆论的压力下，美方才被迫和我方恢复谈判。
    谈判恢复以后，美方对他们的企图使军事分界线深入我方阵地的要求，虽然不得不作了修改，但十月二十五日却又提出企图侵占我方开城地区的新方案，并将按照这一方案划定军事分界线的地图交给我方，主张立即具体确定军事分界线和非军事区。美方发言人纳科斯当天就告记者说：“沿（美方所建议的）缓冲地带中部划定分界线是完全恰当的”。小组委员会美方代表霍治在提出这个建议时说，美方所主张立即划定的军事分界线，“体现了军事停战的第一个要求”。十月二十七日，美联社从板门店发出的电讯也承认：“联军代表们坚持划定停火线的要求”。
    美方所主张立即划定军事分界线和非军事区的方案，名为“大体上按照战斗接触线”，而实际上却要我方片面地退出一千五百平方公里，将开城“调整”到美方控制之下。从十月二十六日到十一月四日的十天当中，我方代表严正地拒斥了美方的这种荒谬方案。我方代表为了解除对方的一切藉口而尽了极大的努力，相继提出了以现有战线为基础，对整个战场加以全面调整的方案，以及就地停战、不作任何调整的方案。美方如果尚有达成停战的诚意，应该接受我方这些公平合理的建议，使军事分界线问题迅速获得协议。但是美方鉴于其利用谈判来侵占我方土地的计划已经破产，而其拖延谈判的政策又面临失败的危险，于是狗急跳墙，竟在十一月五日的小组委员会上公然提出推翻双方关于议程的协议，并前后矛盾地拒绝目前具体划定军事分界线和非军事区，而要将这一工作推延到无限期的将来。
    十一月七日，我方正式提出以就地停战为内容的军事分界线与非军事区方案。虽然美方发言人对这一方案加以肆意的曲解，但就连美国的国际新闻社记者也不得不承认：“共产党的建议使盟方处于尴尬的境地”，使美方暴露了它自己“是希望继续战斗的一方”。国新社记者说：“再没有比这件事更容易令双方人民了解的了。”就在这种情况下，美方在八、九两日的小组会中，对我方的方案提不出任何理由加以反对，但却一再无赖地说明如要具体确定军事分界线，即应接受他们十一月八日再度提出的将开城地区“调整”到美方控制之下的方案，否则美方就根本推翻第二项议程。
    在我方的揭露下，美方理屈词穷，索性撕破面皮，公开承认美方有意推翻第二项议程。美方发言人纳科斯十一月九日恬不知耻地说：美方对于他们自己所同意而且曾竭力主张过的“建立固定的分界线的办法，开始有所怀疑了”。美联社记者说：“纳科斯承认：这就表明盟方的态度两个星期来已经有了改变。”连美联社记者也没有忘记，美方这种改变正是自打嘴巴的狼狈行为，他说：“在十月二十五日（就是停火谈判恢复的那一天），联合国方面自己曾建议建立临时的缓冲区。”
    根据上述，人们可以很清楚地看出：当军事分界线方案对美方片面有利、而我方显然不能接受时，他们就主张立即具体确定它；而当方案是对双方公平合理和可以促成早日停战而他们又不能公开反对时，他们就反对具体确定它。美国侵略者采取如此自相矛盾、反复无常的无赖态度，在全世界舆论面前充分暴露了他们蓄意拖延和阻挠朝鲜停战谈判的丑恶阴谋。可以肯定地说，美方这种拖延谈判的政策终究是要失败的。
