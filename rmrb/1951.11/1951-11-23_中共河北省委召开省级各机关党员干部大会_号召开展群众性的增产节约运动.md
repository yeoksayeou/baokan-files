    CCP Hebei Provincial Committee Convenes Meeting of Party Member Cadres from Provincial-Level Organs, Calling for a Mass Movement of Increased Production and Thrift
    The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in response to Chairman Mao's call for increased production and thrift, convened a meeting of party member cadres from provincial-level organs on the 18th of this month. At the meeting, Comrade Yang Xiufeng spoke on behalf of the Hebei Provincial Committee, calling on all party members, cadres, and staff of the provincial-level organs to respond to Chairman Mao's call for increased production and thrift with practical actions. After explaining the great significance of carrying out increased production and thrift and opposing corruption and waste, Comrade Yang Xiufeng pointed out that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, and the North China Bureau, the Party in the Hebei region has achieved certain successes in its various tasks. The vast majority of party members and cadres have been able to maintain a hard-working and simple style and serve the people wholeheartedly. However, there are also some organs and individuals that have serious phenomena of waste. There are even a few party members and cadres with poor political quality who have been infected with the ideological consciousness of the exploiting classes and have engaged in serious acts of corruption and degeneration. In terms of waste, taking the construction of office buildings as an example, the losses caused by starting construction without approved plans and budgets, and by incorrect designs and blind construction, are very serious. The irresponsibility of some staff members has also caused serious waste. In addition, some organs rely on having "small private coffers," do not abide by the rules, and spend money recklessly. The waste caused by extravagance in daily life is also not small. This is a relatively common tendency, and we must raise our vigilance.
    Next, Comrade Yang Xiufeng pointed out that the movement for increased production and thrift should start with the leading cadres of leading organs and be carried out universally from top to bottom. The specific steps to be taken are: first, carry out in-depth ideological mobilization of party members and cadres, so that everyone recognizes the great significance of increased production and thrift and the harm of corruption and waste to the people's cause. Then, mobilize everyone to carry out criticism and self-criticism, expose facts of extravagance and waste, corruption, and degeneration, and oppose bureaucratic work styles. Comrade Yang Xiufeng also pointed out that it is necessary to improve the Party's organizational life, establish and improve various systems, and formulate thrift plans to ensure the smooth development of the thrift movement. Comrade Yang Xiufeng also put forward some specific methods for carrying out the thrift movement and asked the organs to deliberate and discuss them. Finally, Comrade Li Ziguang, Secretary-General of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CCP, proposed to the party member cadres of various organs and units that they should deeply discuss Comrade Yang Xiufeng's report and formulate plans based on the specific conditions of their units, and quickly launch a mass movement of increased production and thrift.

    中共河北省委召开省级各机关党员干部大会
    号召开展群众性的增产节约运动
    中共河北省委，响应毛主席增产节约的号召，在本月十八日，召开了省级各机关的党员干部大会。会上由杨秀峰同志代表河北省委讲话，他号召省级机关全体党员、干部和工作人员以实际行动来响应毛主席的增产节约号召。杨秀峰同志在说明开展增产节约、反对贪污浪费的重大意义后，即指出：河北省地区的党在毛主席、党中央和华北局的领导下，各项工作都获得一定成绩，绝大多数的党员和干部都能保持艰苦朴素的作风，全心全意为人民服务。但是也有些机关和个人，存在着严重的浪费现象，甚至有少数政治品质恶劣的党员和干部，沾染了剥削阶级的思想意识，发生了严重的贪污腐化行为。在浪费方面，仅以机关盖房子说，由于计划和预算未经批准，擅自动工，和没有正确设计，盲目施工，而造成的损失就是非常严重的。而某些工作人员对工作的不负责任，也造成了严重的浪费。另外，有些机关仗恃着有“小家务”，不遵守制度，乱花钱，在生活上的铺张所造成的浪费，也是不小的。这是一个比较普遍的倾向，必须提起我们高度的警惕。
    接着，杨秀峰同志指出：开展增产节约运动，首先要从领导机关负责干部开始，从上到下，普遍开展。进行的具体步骤：先对党员、干部进行深入的思想动员，使每个人都认识到增产节约的重大意义和贪污浪费对人民事业的危害。然后发动大家开展批评与自我批评，揭发铺张浪费、贪污腐化事实，反对官僚主义作风。杨秀峰同志又指出：必须健全党的组织生活，建立和健全各种制度，制订节约计划，以保证节约运动顺利展开。杨秀峰同志并对开展节约运动提出了一些具体办法，交各机关酝酿讨论。最后，中共河北省委秘书长李子光同志，向各机关、各单位的党员干部提出：应深入讨论杨秀峰同志的报告，并根据本单位具体情况制订计划，迅速开展群众性的增产节约运动。
