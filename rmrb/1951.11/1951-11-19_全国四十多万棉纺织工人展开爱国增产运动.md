Xinhua News Agency, 18th: Since November 1st, over 400,000 cotton textile workers across the country have universally launched a patriotic production surge movement. Public and private cotton textile factories in various regions have followed the instructions of the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government and the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China, adding work hours without overtime, and adding overtime without extra work hours. Workers who add work hours are given two eggs per person per day to protect the health of the employees. The workers expressed gratitude for the People's Government's concern for their health, and their production enthusiasm is high, guaranteeing to complete the glorious task, and new records are being created in various places. For example, the fine yarn output of the Shanghai Private Shenxin No. 9 Factory and the Hangzhou Chang'an Yarn Factory have both created the highest records since the factory was established. Most factories in North China, Northeast China, Northwest China, and East China are promoting the Hao Jianxiu work method in the production increase movement, improving technology, increasing output and quality, and saving raw materials. However, there are also a few factories that have relaxed their leadership over the production surge work due to carrying out other work, which needs to be improved urgently.

    全国四十多万棉纺织工人
    展开爱国增产运动
    【新华社十八日讯】全国四十余万棉纺织工人自十一月一日起，已普遍展开爱国突击增产运动。各地公私营棉纺织厂都已遵照中央人民政府纺织工业部和中国纺织工会全国委员会的指示，加点者不加班，加班者不加点；对加点的工人，每人每天发给鸡蛋两枚，以保护职工健康。职工们对人民政府如此关怀职工健康，表示感谢，生产情绪高涨，纷纷保证完成光荣任务，各地接连创造了新的纪录。例如上海私营申新九厂、杭州长安纱厂的细纱出数，就都创造了开厂以来的最高纪录。华北、东北、西北、华东等地大部分的工厂都在增产运动中，同时推行郝建秀工作法，提高技术，提高产量和质量，节约原料。但也有少数工厂，因进行其他工作而放松了对突击增产工作的领导，亟待改进。
