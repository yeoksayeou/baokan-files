    The North Danche Village Cooperative in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province
    Organizes Members to Use Cotton to Pay Public Grain

    Editor: The North Danche Village Cooperative in Pingshun County organizes its members to use cotton to pay public grain, saving the members expenses and time, and is supported by the members. At the beginning, the masses were unwilling to use cotton to pay public grain. The cooperative cadres of the village, in response to this ideological situation, educated the members by using accounting methods. They pointed out to the members that if they started from this village to transport public grain to the Changzhi Special District, they would have to travel one hundred and twenty miles. Each animal would carry more than two hundred catties, and it would take five days for a round trip. The needs of people and animals would be calculated at thirteen catties of rice per day, which would cost sixty-five catties of rice in five days. And it would also delay the autumn cultivation. Adopting the method of paying public grain with cotton can not only save time and expenses, but also supply raw materials for the country's textile industry. After education, the cotton farmers' awareness was raised. Labor model Duan Maohai said: "The government considers everything for us. This spring, the county cooperative helped us solve the problem of improved cotton seeds and fertilizers, which increased our cotton production. Now it also saves us money and labor by using cotton to replace public grain." Under his leadership, all the cotton farmers in the village are willing to use cotton to pay public grain. This village should pay 36,735 catties of public grain this year, which is equivalent to 3,174 catties of cotton. Now all the members of the village have signed a contract with the cooperative to pay public grain with cotton, stipulating that half of it will be completed before November 15th, and all of it will be paid by December 10th.

　　山西平顺县北耽车村合作社
    组织社员用棉花顶缴公粮
    编辑同志：平顺县北耽车村合作社，组织社员群众用棉花顶缴公粮，节省了社员的开支和时间，受到社员群众的拥护。开始时群众都不愿用棉花缴公粮，该村合作社干部针对这一思想情况，用算账的办法对社员进行教育。他们对社员指出，如从本村出发往长治专区送公粮，要走一百二十里路，每头牲口驮上二百多斤，往返就得五天，人和牲口的需用，每天按十三斤米计算，五天就要花费六十五斤米。并且还要耽误秋耕。采用以棉花缴公粮的办法，不仅可以节省时间和开支，同时还供应了国家的纺织工业原料。经教育后，棉农觉悟提高。劳动模范段毛孩说：“政府处处都替咱打算，今春县社帮助咱解决优良棉种及肥料问题，使咱棉花增产，现在又给咱省钱省工，以棉代缴公粮。”在他的带动下，全村棉农都愿用棉花顶缴公粮。该村今年应缴公粮三万六千七百三十五斤，兑成棉花为三千一百七十四斤。现全村社员已与合作社订好以棉花缴公粮合同，规定于十一月十五日前完成一半，至十二月十日全部缴齐。
