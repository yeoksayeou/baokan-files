    Dezhou Station Workers Assist in Material
    Exchange Tasks, Reducing Cargo Losses
    Comrade Editor: Thanks to the active assistance of railway workers in transportation, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives successfully completed the material exchange work organized in the three major regions this spring. Among them, all employees of Dezhou Station highly demonstrated a good work style of mutual assistance, friendship, and love for the people's property, successfully completing the allocation and handling of nearly 40 million jin of soybean cakes and red sorghum. In order to thank all the employees of the station for their friendly assistance, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives presented them with a banner and a reward of 10 million yuan at the National Railway Model Workers Representative Conference.
    During the transportation process, all the employees of Dezhou Station promptly unloaded the goods upon arrival and added tarpaulins to cover them in case of rain, thus reducing cargo losses.
    In response, all the employees of Dezhou Station stated that they are determined to do their work even better in the future, strengthen transportation efficiency, and further promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas.    All-China Federation of Cooperatives

    编辑同志：中华全国合作社联合总社在今春组织的三大区物资交流工作中，由于铁道职工同志在运输上的积极协助，得以胜利完成。其中德州车站全体职工，高度地发挥了互助友爱与爱护人民财产的优良工作作风，顺利完成约近四千万斤豆饼和红粮的调拨搬运任务。合作总社为了酬谢该站全体职工的友谊协助，特在全国铁路劳动模范代表会议上转赠他们锦旗一面、奖金一千万元。
    德州车站全体职工，在运输过程中，货到时，就及时卸车，遇雨即加苫盖，因此，使货物损耗量减少。
