Farmers across the country are working hard on autumn plowing and wheat sowing. To increase grain production next year, wheat-producing areas are expanding wheat planting areas this autumn. The wheat planting area in the entire North China region will be 1% larger than last year. Among them, Shanxi Province will plant approximately 4% more wheat than last year; Changwei Prefecture, a major wheat-producing area in Shandong Province, will plant 5% more wheat this year than last year; the planned wheat planting area in northern Anhui this year will reach 40% of the total cultivated area in the region, with some areas planting wheat on 70% of their local cultivated land; Jiangxi Province will expand its winter planting area by 100% this year compared to last year.

In order to increase the yield per unit area of wheat fields next year, wheat planting in various regions focuses on selecting superior seeds, soaking seeds and mixing them with pesticides, deep plowing, and fertilization. The amount of fertilizer applied to wheat fields this year in Shandong, northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, Shanxi, Hebei, and Pingyuan provinces has exceeded that of last year. Laixi County, Shandong Province, used a total of 4 million jin of bean cake when planting wheat this autumn, double that of last year; Huantai County used a total of 20 million jin of bean cake when planting wheat this autumn, roughly equivalent to the county's total annual fertilizer application last year. In Yuncheng Prefecture, Shanxi Province alone, 3.43 million jin of fertilizer, such as oil cake and bone meal, were loaned out for wheat planting. Farmers along the lake area of ​​Huxi Prefecture in Pingyuan Province, who rarely fertilized wheat fields in the past, are now applying fertilizer universally.

Currently, major wheat-producing areas such as Henan, Hebei, Pingyuan, Shandong, northern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, and Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province have either nearly completed or are approaching completion of wheat sowing. In many areas south of the Yangtze River, farmers are stepping up planting. (Xinhua News Agency)

Heilongjiang Province, known as the "Northeast Granary," has seen new records of high yields for many grain crops this year. More than a dozen mutual aid teams in Suihua, Hailun, Qinggang and other counties achieved an average wheat yield of 437 jin per mu this year, exceeding the yield of ordinary wheat fields by more than one and a half times. Dai You, a farmer in Minzhu Village, Hailun County, harvested 550 jin of wheat per mu, three times more than the wheat fields of other local farmers. Fang Zhaozhong's mutual aid team in Kedong County can harvest 920 jin of corn per mu, more than two and a half times higher than the general yield. Sun Cai, a farmer in Dongbaitushan Village, Longjiang County, estimates that his ten mu of sandy sorghum will yield 5,600 jin, exceeding the sorghum yield of the most fertile cultivated land in the area in previous years. The soybeans planted at the Qiqihar Horticultural Experimental Site can yield more than 650 jin per mu, an increase of more than double compared to previous years. The corn planted at the site can yield 925 jin per mu.

These new yield records have emerged from the patriotic production increase campaign and are the result of farmers' improvements in agricultural techniques. These farmers who have achieved bumper harvests have all paid attention to selecting superior seeds, disinfecting seeds, applying more fertilizer, and deep plowing and careful cultivation. For example, Dai You, the farmer in Hailun County who created the highest wheat yield, carefully selected his wheat seeds, and applied more fertilizer and cultivated more frequently than ordinary farmers.

The emergence of new agricultural production records has played a significant role in breaking the conservative thinking of rural work cadres and farmers. This spring, when the province called for increasing the yield per unit area, it was met with resistance from many district and village cadres and farmers; the general thinking of farmers was "more land reclamation means more grain." Now they realize that improving technology can increase the yield per unit area, and their confidence in increasing production has increased a hundredfold. They have asked farmers who have created new records to introduce their experience in achieving high yields.

### 实行科学耕作法提高单位面积产量  全国各地农民积极播种冬麦  黑龙江今年粮食作物出现了丰产新纪录

    实行科学耕作法提高单位面积产量
    全国各地农民积极播种冬麦
    黑龙江今年粮食作物出现了丰产新纪录
    全国各地农民正在紧张地进行秋耕种麦。为增加明年粮食的产量，各产麦区今秋都扩大了小麦的播种面积。华北全区种麦面积将比去年扩大百分之一，其中，山西省播种小麦的面积比去年扩大约百分之四；山东省主要产麦区昌潍专区今年种麦的面积比去年扩大了百分之五；皖北今年计划种麦的面积，将达该区总耕地面积百分之四十，部分地区种麦面积达当地耕地面积的百分之七十；江西省今年冬种的面积，将比去年扩大一倍。
    为了提高明年麦田的单位面积产量，各地种麦都很注意选用良种、浸种拌种和深耕施肥。山东、苏北、皖北、山西、河北、平原等省区，今年麦田的施肥量都超过了去年。山东省莱西全县今秋种麦时共用豆饼四百万斤，比去年增加了一倍；桓台县今秋种麦共用豆饼二千万斤，约等于该县农田去年全年的施肥量。山西省仅运城专区，种麦时就贷出了油饼、骨粉等肥料三百四十三万斤。平原省湖西专区沿湖一带农民，过去很少给麦地上肥的，今年也普遍施了肥。
    现在，各主要产麦区如河南、河北、平原、山东、皖北、苏北和陕西省关中地区，有的已差不多完成了种麦，有的接近完成。长江以南许多地区，农民正在加紧播种。（新华社）
    以“东北粮仓”著称的黑龙江省，今年许多粮食作物都出现了丰产的新纪录。绥化、海伦、青冈等县有十几个互助组今年的小麦平均每亩产四百三十七斤，超过一般麦田产量的一倍半以上。海伦县民主村农民戴有的小麦，每亩产五百五十斤，较当地其他农民的麦田多收三倍。克东县房兆忠互助组的玉米每亩可收九百二十斤，较一般产量高二倍半以上。龙江县东白土山村农民孙才的十亩沙包子高粱，估计能收五千六百斤，将超过往年当地最肥沃耕地的高粱产量。齐齐哈尔市园艺试验场所种的大豆每亩可收六百五十余斤，较往年增产一倍多。该场所种玉米每亩可收九百二十五斤。
    这些产量的新纪录，都是在爱国丰产竞赛中出现的，是农民改进农作技术的结果。这些丰收的农民，他们都很注意选用良种、种籽消毒、多施肥量和深耕细作。如小麦最高产量的创造者——海伦县农民戴有，他的麦种是经过了精选的，每亩麦田上的肥料和铲趟的遍数都比一般农民多。
    农业生产新纪录的涌现，对打破农村工作干部和农民的保守思想起了极大的作用。今年春天，该省号召提高单位面积的产量时，曾遭到许多区、村干部和农民的抵抗；一般农民的思想是“多开荒就能多打粮食”。现在他们认识到改进技术就能提高单位面积的产量，增产的信心百倍提高，纷纷要求创造新纪录的农民介绍丰产的经验。
