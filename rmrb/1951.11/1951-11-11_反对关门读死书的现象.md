    Oppose the Phenomenon of Studying Behind Closed Doors
    Since the beginning of this semester, the phenomenon of "burying oneself in books and not asking about politics" has reappeared in some schools. For example, the Communist Party branch, the Communist Youth League branch, the administrative leadership, and the student union of Nanjing Municipal Second Girls' Middle School, due to being "busy with work," abandoned the work of leading, inspecting, and revising the patriotic pact. Most students have forgotten the patriotic pacts they made last semester. Many students don't even read newspapers. Recently, the whole school held a current affairs test, and the total average score of nine out of nineteen classes failed. In some secondary schools in Qianwei and Yibin counties in southern Sichuan, after correcting the chaotic phenomena in the schools last semester, they cancelled social activities, including current affairs study, this semester. The school leaders even believe that celebrating National Day would "hinder the progress of regular classes."
    It should be pointed out that the task of people's schools is to cultivate all-round talents for the country with a high degree of political consciousness and rich scientific and cultural knowledge. Therefore, the chaotic phenomenon of randomly drawing and transferring students and excessive social activities hindering study in schools should be opposed, but this is by no means to ask students to turn a deaf ear to politics and just study behind closed doors. On the contrary, regular current affairs and political education must be strengthened. Only in this way can we improve the political consciousness of teachers and students and make them love the motherland. If our people's schools do not pay attention to important patriotic movements such as patriotic pacts and celebrating National Day, and do not care about national affairs, even if they cram hard, the students they teach will only be short-sighted "bookworms" and "scholars" who are divorced from theory and practice. There is no doubt that this phenomenon should be opposed.

    反对关门读死书的现象
    这学期开学以来，某些学校又出现了“埋头读书，不问政治”的现象。例如南京市立第二女子中学的共产党支部、青年团支部、行政领导方面和学生会，因为“工作忙”，就把领导检查、修订爱国公约的工作放弃了。大部分学生已经忘记了上学期订立的爱国公约。许多学生连报纸也不看了。最近全校举行了一次时事测验，十九个班有九个班的总平均分数不及格。川南犍为、宜宾等县某些中等学校，在纠正了上学期学校中的混乱现象以后，这学期把社会活动连时事学习都取消了。学校的负责人甚至认为庆祝国庆节也“有碍正课的进行”。
    应当指出，人民学校的任务是为国家培养具有高度的政治觉悟和丰富的科学文化知识的全面人材。因此，在学校里乱抽乱调学生和社会活动过多妨害学习的混乱现象是应该反对的，但这绝不是要学生对政治不闻不问，只是关起门来读死书。相反的，经常的时事、政治教育还必须加强。只有这样，才能提高教师、学生的政治觉悟，使他们热爱祖国。如果我们的人民学校对爱国公约、庆祝国庆节这种重要的爱国运动不予重视，对国事毫不关心，即使死钻功课，教出来的学生也只会是许多鼠目寸光的“书呆子”和理论与实际脱节的“秀才”。毫无疑问，这种现象是应该反对的。
