Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch (TASS, 15th dispatch): The Japanese workers' struggle for wage increases has recently greatly expanded.

As previously reported, more than 200,000 miners belonging to the Japan Coal Miners' Union began a second 72-hour strike on the 5th, which continued until the 7th.

On the 11th, the Japan Coal Miners' Union held another 72-hour strike, with 230,000 people participating. The strike was stopped on the same day because the union was forced by the US occupation headquarters to accept a compromise proposal from the capitalists.

During those days, Emes, the chief of the Labor Section of Ridgway's headquarters, repeatedly summoned representatives of the capitalists and the union for talks, openly threatening them with the headquarters' intervention.

In early November, 36,000 workers belonging to the Japan Mine Workers' Union and about 7,000 workers from ten small mines in Hokkaido also held strikes.

Workers in other industries have also carried out struggles for wage increases. According to statistics from the Japanese Ministry of Labor, 32 major trade unions across the country have unanimously demanded wage increases.

Employees of state-owned enterprises and public utilities, who do not have the right to strike under Japanese law, have also carried out active struggles for wage increases.

The unions of teachers, postal employees, and government agency staff have also put forward demands for wage increases.

Japanese workers are also stepping up their political struggles, the basic content of which is to oppose the ratification of the separate "peace treaty" and the aggressive "security treaty," and to oppose the repressive laws that the Yoshida government is drafting.

The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, under the influence of the Socialist Party, issued a statement saying: "An emergency situation has emerged," and called on workers to resolutely oppose the revision of the labor law. The General Council of Trade Unions decided to hold a two-hour general strike on November 17 to protest the bills banning general strikes and tightening control over trade unions.

The General Federation of Private Railway Workers' Unions and the Coal Miners' Union also issued statements protesting this bill.

　　要求增加工资反对单独“和约”
    日本工人积极斗争
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社十五日讯：日本工人要求增加工资的斗争，最近大大扩大了。
    前已报道，日本煤矿工人工会所属二十多万名矿工于五日开始第二次七十二小时的罢工，一直继续到七日。
    十一日，日本煤矿工人工会又举行一次七十二小时的罢工，参加的人数有二十三万。这次罢工于同日停止，因为工会被美国占领军总部强迫接受资方的折衷建议。
    在那几天，李奇微总部劳工科科长艾米斯曾一再召集资方和工会的代表谈话，公然以总部的干涉相威胁。
    十一月上旬，日本矿山工人工会所属三万六千名工人和北海道的十个小矿的约七千名工人，也举行了罢工。
    其他工业的工人也进行了要求增加工资的斗争。根据日本劳动省的统计，全国有三十二个大工会一致要求增加工资。
    按照日本法律没有权利举行罢工的国营企业和公用事业的职工，也进行了要求增加工资的积极斗争。
    教员、邮局雇员和政府机关工作人员的工会也都提出增加工资的要求。
    日本工人也在加紧进行政治斗争，这种斗争的基本内容是反对批准单独“和约”和侵略性的“安全条约”、反对吉田政府正在草拟的镇压性的法律。
    社会党影响下的日本工会总评议会发表声明说：紧急局面已经出现，并号召工人坚决反对修改劳工法。工会总评议会决定于十一月十七日举行两小时的总罢工，抗议禁止总罢工和加紧管制工会的法案。
    私营铁路工会总联合会和煤矿工人工会也发表了抗议这个法案的声明。
