    Shanghai Public and Private Cotton Mills Launch Production Increase Campaign
    Broad Masses of Workers Guarantee Completion of Production Increase Tasks
    According to the instructions of the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government and the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China, the 72 public and private cotton mills in Shanghai have fully launched a patriotic production increase campaign since the 1st of this month. Twenty-six state-owned and joint state-private cotton mills and four private cotton mills in the city have increased their operating hours from five days and seven nights in October to six days and seven nights; the remaining forty-two cotton mills have added one hour per shift. Workers have full confidence in guaranteeing the completion of this glorious production increase task. The city's 200,000 textile workers enthusiastically discussed the call issued by the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China on October 27 regarding completing the winter increase in yarn and cloth production. They said: "We have long polished our weapons—the machines—hoping to fight a beautiful battle to support our dearest Volunteer Army comrades and also to give our hardworking peasant brothers new clothes." Staff and workers of state-owned Shanghai No. 1 and No. 11 Cotton Mills, private Zhongfang No. 2 Mill, Wing On Textile Company No. 2 Mill, and other factories have re-drafted patriotic pledges to welcome the great production drive, guaranteeing to complete and strive to exceed their targets. Workers and technicians from across the city who are studying the Hao Jianxiu work method jointly wrote a letter to the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China, expressing their intention to intensify the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu work method during the production increase campaign, save more cotton, and spin more and better yarn. The Xu Houxi team of the Cleaning and Maintenance Section of state-owned Shanghai No. 12 Cotton Mill established a shock repair team on October 30 to ensure the timely repair of broken machines and reduce downtime.
    The administrative departments of state-owned factories, the capitalists of private factories, and the trade unions of each factory have paid attention to strengthening labor protection work in order to take care of the health of employees during the production increase period. Most state-owned cotton mills and private yarn factories such as Qingfeng are preparing to set up employee sanatoriums and nutritious canteens. The amount of meat on each dining table at Shenxin No. 9 Factory has been increased by half compared to the past. Anle No. 3 Factory has increased the daily allowance for each person by one bowl of soy milk and one egg. State-owned Shanghai No. 11 Cotton Mill has made cotton overcoats for female workers who go out at night to breastfeed their babies. The trade union and family affairs committee of state-owned Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Mill have bought some toys and are preparing to gather the workers' children together to play during the day, so that the fathers and mothers who work the night shift can get a good rest.

    上海公私棉纺织厂展开增产运动
    广大工人保证完成增产任务
    上海七十二家公私营棉纺织厂根据中央人民政府纺织工业部和中国纺织工会全国委员会的指示，已自本月一日起全面展开爱国增产运动。全市二十六个公营、公私合营的棉纺织厂和四个私营棉纺织厂，已由十月份开工五天七夜增加到六天七夜；其余四十二个棉纺织厂每班加点一小时。工人们都有充分信心保证完成这一光荣的增产任务。全市二十万纺织工人曾兴奋地讨论了中国纺织工会全国委员会在十月二十七日发出的关于完成冬季增加纱布生产的号召。他们说：“我们老早就擦好了武器——机器，盼着打一个漂亮仗来支援我们最亲爱的志愿军同志，同时也给我们辛辛苦苦的农民兄弟换换新衣服。”国营上海第一、第十一棉纺织厂、私营中纺二厂、永安纺织公司第二厂等厂职工已重新订出迎接大生产的爱国公约，保证完成并争取超过任务。全市学习郝建秀工作法的工人和技术人员联名写信给中国纺织工会全国委员会，表示要在增产运动中加紧推广郝建秀工作法，节省更多的棉花，纺出更多更好的纱。国营上海第十二棉纺织厂清花间保全部徐厚喜小组，在十月三十日成立了突击抢修队，保证随时修好坏机器，减少停车时间。
    公营各厂的行政方面、私营各厂的资方、各厂的工会，为了照顾增产期间职工的健康，已注意加强劳动保护工作。大部分国营棉纺织厂和庆丰等私营纱厂正在筹设职工业余休养所和营养食堂。申新九厂每张饭桌比过去多了一半肉量。安乐三厂每人每日增加一碗豆浆、一个鸡蛋。国营上海第十一棉纺织厂替夜间外出喂奶的女工做了棉大衣。国营上海第十七棉纺织厂工会和家属工作委员会买了一些玩具，准备在白天把工人的孩子们集合在一起玩，好让做夜工的爸爸、妈妈们好好休息。    （新华社）
