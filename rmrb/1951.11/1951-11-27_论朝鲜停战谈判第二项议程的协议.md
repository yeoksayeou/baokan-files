    On the Agreement on the Second Item of the Korean Armistice Negotiations Agenda

    The representatives of both sides of the Korean Armistice Negotiation Subcommittee reached an agreement on the second item of the agenda on the 23rd of this month, in accordance with the fair and reasonable proposal of the delegation of the Korean People’s Army and the Chinese People’s Volunteer Army. This is the first agreement on substantive issues reached by both sides in the Korean armistice negotiations in more than four months, and it is also an important progress in the armistice negotiations.

    The Korean armistice negotiations, which began in the hot July, have been dragging on until now—the early winter when snow has already fallen on the Korean battlefield. The only reason for reaching this agreement on substantive issues now is that the U.S. side representatives have consistently adopted a delaying tactic during the negotiation process. Especially after the negotiations entered the second item of the agenda, the U.S. side repeatedly put forward unreasonable demands and created many provocative incidents to obstruct the negotiations. These arrogant demands and provocative incidents by the U.S. side have been severely rebuked by our side, and the U.S. side had to abandon its arrogant demands and admit its mistakes for its provocative behavior. The main trick of the U.S. side is the so-called "military pressure." However, the repeated offensives by the U.S. side during the negotiations have been severely打击 (dǎ jī, literally "hit") by the Korean-Chinese People's Army. The Anglo-American bourgeois newspapers had to admit that "American negotiators are becoming increasingly aware that the Allied forces can really no longer use continued operations to gain further benefits." (Washington dispatch of the British "Sunday Times" on November 18). This means that the serious setbacks suffered by the invaders in the military have forced them to accept what they were previously unwilling to accept. At the same time, the pressure of world opinion, as well as the dissatisfaction of the U.S. satellite countries, the American and British people, and the American and British soldiers with the U.S. side's delay in negotiations, have made all the U.S. side's conspiracies and tricks to continue delaying the negotiations temporarily unable to continue, and they had to agree to the fair and reasonable proposal put forward by our representatives, so that the second item of the agenda was finally agreed upon.

    The facts are like this. However, the American generals dare not admit this fact. Brigadier General Nuckols, the spokesman of the United Nations Command Armistice Negotiation Delegation, told the American and British reporters on the day the agreement was reached on the 23rd of this month: "Today's agreement can just meet the requirements put forward by the Allied forces when the negotiations began in July." The record of the negotiations proves that this is another lie told by the American generals to the people of the world.

    At the first meeting when the armistice negotiations began on July 10, our chief representative, General Nam Il, put forward a proposal based on fair and reasonable principles, determining the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line, with the armed forces of both sides simultaneously withdrawing ten kilometers from the 38th parallel, and designating the withdrawal zone as a demilitarized zone. When both sides reached an agreement on the agenda and began discussing the second item of the agenda, our representative reiterated this proposal. The reason why our representative made this proposal at that time was that taking the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line was in line with and reflected the then military situation, that is, both sides occupied approximately equal land areas north and south of the 38th parallel. However, the plan proposed by the U.S. representative on July 27 regarding the military demarcation line was unreasonably based on the so-called "compensation for naval and air force advantages," demanding that the military demarcation line be drawn far into our positions from the then front line, attempting to make the Chinese and Korean People's Forces withdraw from the then front line 38 to 53 kilometers east of the Imjin River, and about 68 kilometers west of the Imjin River, so that the U.S. side could obtain more than 12,000 square kilometers of land without firing a shot. This U.S. plan was so absurd that it dared not make it public to the world at that time. This is what Nuckols called the U.S. side's "requirements put forward when the negotiations began in July." Following this, the U.S. side proposed on October 25 the "demand" to invade our Kaesong and penetrate 1,500 square kilometers into our positions. These "demands" have nothing in common with the current agreement which contains an in-place armistice and takes the actual line of contact between the two sides as the military demarcation line. Because their consistent "demands" since July are completely different from the current agreement, they once wanted to overturn the second item of the agenda in order to avoid reaching the current agreement. But after the American generals were forced to abandon their unreasonable "demands" and accepted this fair and reasonable agreement, they tried to confuse two completely different things. If this is not to cover up their shameless blackmail and the sadness of military failure, what else could it be for? In fact, the agreement now reached on the second item of the agenda is precisely in line with the principle of reaching an agreement on a fair and reasonable basis that our representative has always insisted on. Because the current actual line of contact between the two sides has not undergone any significant changes compared with the actual situation at the beginning of the negotiations, and both sides still occupy approximately equal land areas north and south of the 38th parallel.

    The facts of the past four months have proved that as long as the U.S. side is willing to solve the problem on the fair and reasonable basis proposed by our side, the negotiations can proceed smoothly and an agreement can be reached; and if the U.S. side repeats its trick of delaying the negotiations, the future of the negotiations will still be hindered. There are still many major issues in the future of the negotiations. In order to strive for the resolution of these major issues, the Chinese and Korean people and the peace-loving people of the world must continue to wage an unwavering struggle against the U.S. aggressors, forcing them to abandon all kinds of tricks of delay and blackmail. Only in this way can the Korean armistice negotiations have a hope of success.

### 论朝鲜停战谈判第二项议程的协议

    论朝鲜停战谈判第二项议程的协议
    朝鲜停战谈判小组委员会双方代表已于本月二十三日按照朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团公平合理的建议，对第二项议程达成协议。这是朝鲜停战谈判四个多月以来，双方在实质问题上取得的第一个协议，也是停战谈判的第一个重要进展。
    朝鲜停战谈判自炎热的七月开始，一直拖延到现在——朝鲜战场上已经飘雪的初冬，才在实质问题上取得这个协议，唯一的原因，是由于美方代表在谈判过程中一贯地采取了拖延政策。尤其是在谈判进入第二项议程以后，美方多次提出蛮横无理的要求，并制造了许多挑衅事件来阻挠谈判的进行。美方的这些狂妄要求和挑衅事件都受到我方的严正斥责，美方不得不放弃自己的狂妄要求，并对自己的挑衅行为承认错误。美方的主要手腕是所谓“军事压力”。但是美方在谈判期间的多次进攻又受到了朝中人民军队的惨重的打击。美英资产阶级报纸不得不承认“美国谈判代表愈来愈明白：联军已真的不能再用继续作战的办法来获得进一步的利益了”。（英国“星期泰晤士报”十一月十八日华盛顿专电）这就是说侵略者在军事上不断遭受的严重挫败，已经迫使他们不能不接受他们先前所不愿意接受的东西。同时，世界舆论的压力，以及美国的附庸国家、美英人民和美英士兵对美方拖延谈判的不满，都使美方继续拖延的一切阴谋诡计暂时无从继续施展，不得不同意我方代表所提出的公平合理的建议，使第二项议程终于达成了协议。
    事实就是这样。然而美国的将军们却不敢承认这个事实。联合国军停战谈判代表团发言人纳科斯准将在本月二十三日协议达成的那一天，就曾对美英记者们说：“今天的协议正可以满足联军在七月间谈判开始时所提出的要求。”谈判的纪录，证明这是美国将军们又一次在世界人民面前撒谎。
    在七月十日停战谈判开始的首次会议上，我方首席代表南日将军即根据公平合理的原则提出了确定三八线为军事分界线，双方武装部队同时撤离三八线十公里，并以撤离地带为非军事区的建议。在双方对议程获致协议并开始讨论第二项议程的时候，我方代表又曾重申过这一主张。我方代表当时之所以如此主张，是因为以三八线为军事分界线实符合并反映了当时的军事实况，即双方在三八线南北各占有大约相等的土地面积。然而美方代表在七月二十七日所提出的关于军事分界线的方案却蛮横无理地借口所谓“海空军优势的补偿”，要求将军事分界线划到离当时战线很远的我方阵地之内，企图使中朝人民部队从当时的战线在临津江以东后撤三十八公里至五十三公里，在临津江以西后撤约六十八公里，以便美方不打一枪获得一万二千余方公里的土地。美国的这个方案竟荒谬绝伦到如此程度，以致使它当时不敢将这个方案向全世界公开。这就是纳科斯所谓的美方“在七月间谈判开始时所提出的要求”。继此而后，美方又曾在十月二十五日提出侵占我方开城，深入我方阵地一千五百方公里的“要求”。这些“要求”都是与现在以就地停战为内容，以双方实际接触线为军事分界线的协议毫无相同之处的。因为他们自七月以来一贯的“要求”与现在的协议毫不相同，因此他们曾经想推翻第二项议程以避免取得现在的协议。可是美国将军们却在他们被迫放弃其横蛮无理的“要求”，接受了这个公平合理的协议之后，又来企图把两种绝不相同的东西混为一谈，这如果不是为了掩饰它们的无耻讹诈与军事失败的悲哀，还能够是为了别的什么呢？实际上，现在第二项议程所达成的协议，正是符合于我方代表自始即坚持主张的在公平合理的基础上取得协议的原则的。因为现在的双方实际接触线，与谈判开始时的实际情况并未发生任何重要变化，双方在三八线南北依然各占有大约相等的土地面积。
    过去四个多月的事实证明，只要美方愿意在我方所提出的公平合理的基础上解决问题，谈判就可以顺利进行，就可以取得协议；而如果美方重演其拖延谈判的伎俩，谈判的前途就仍然要受到阻碍。现在谈判前途还有许多重大的问题，为了争取这些重大问题的解决，中朝人民和世界爱好和平的人民必须继续对美国侵略者进行不动摇的斗争，迫使其放弃各种拖延讹诈的诡计。只有这样，朝鲜停战谈判才有成功的希望。
