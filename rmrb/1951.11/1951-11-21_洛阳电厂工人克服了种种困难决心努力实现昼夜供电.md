Dear Chairman Mao: All the workers of our power plant turbine team extend our highest respect to you with boundless enthusiasm! We would like to report to you on the progress and development of our plant since liberation three years ago. In 1948, the Kuomintang bandit army carried out a cruel destruction of our power plant. After liberation, the workers overcame difficulties such as the lack of raw materials, tools, and personnel, repaired their machines in the ruins, and built houses on the ground. In June 1949, the electricity supply to Luoyang City was officially restored. In the past two years, production has changed from loss to profit, the original construction has been gradually restored, and medical clinics, bathhouses, workers' residences, clubs, etc. have been established. Due to the active measures taken in management to develop users, the original six hours of electricity supply per day has now been increased to twelve hours, and day and night power supply will be realized soon, which provides a lot of convenience to the people. As far as our team is concerned, there used to be an average of two or three accidents per month, but now we have basically achieved safe and punctual power generation. In order to supplement technical workers, we completed 100% of the two apprenticeship contracts in four months, trained two turbine drivers and two driver assistants, laying the foundation for day and night power generation. In terms of patriotic donations, in addition to donating all the bonuses earned by the team in the past six months, we also saved and donated 6 million yuan. In the democratic reform movement, our political understanding has been improved, we have clearly distinguished between the enemy and ourselves, all the workers in the team have actively participated in the struggle, overthrown the feudal remnant Ding Juesheng, placed the bad element Li Keqin under control, and specifically revised the patriotic covenant.

Dear Chairman Mao, under your wise leadership, in order to win greater victories for the Chinese people and lasting world peace, we must strive to learn advanced production experience, improve production efficiency, reduce losses, reduce production costs, and contribute all our energy and wisdom to serve the people well and win the battle on the production front.
Luoyang Power Plant Turbine Team, all twelve members

    洛阳电厂工人克服了种种困难决心努力实现昼夜供电
    亲爱的毛主席：我们电厂汽轮小组全体工人以无比的热情向你致崇高的敬礼！我们愿意将解放三年以来本厂的进步发展情况报告给你。一九四八年国民党匪军将我们的电厂进行了残酷的破坏。解放后，工友们克服了原材料、工具及人员缺乏等困难，在废墟中修好了自己的机器，平地上盖起了房屋，一九四九年六月正式恢复了洛阳市区电的供应。二年来生产上由亏本变为盈利，逐步地恢复了原来的建设，并建立了医疗所、浴室、工人住宅、俱乐部等。由于在经营方面采取主动发展用户等措施，原来每天供电六小时，现在已能供电十二小时，不久就可实现昼夜供电，这给人民很多的方便。就我们小组来说，过去每月平均都有两三次事故发生，现在基本上已做到安全正点发电。为了补充技术工人，我们四个月完成了百分之百的两份师徒合同，培养好两个汽机司机和两个司机助手，打下昼夜发电的基础。在爱国捐献上，除将半年来全组所得的奖金全部捐献外，又节约捐献六十万元。在民主改革运动中，我们的政治认识提高了，划清了敌我界线，全组工友均积极参加了斗争，斗倒了封建残余分子丁觉生，管制了坏分子李克勤，并具体修订了爱国公约。
    亲爱的毛主席，我们在你的英明领导下，为争取中国人民的更大胜利和世界的持久和平，我们要努力学习先进的生产经验，提高生产效率，减少损失，降低生产成本，贡献出我们全部精力和智慧，好好为人民服务，在生产战线上打胜仗。洛阳电厂汽轮小组全组十二人
