Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 9th: Commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (CPVA) warmly support the reports and resolutions of the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). During the conference, CPVA commanders and fighters in their camps gathered around radios on time, listening attentively to the recorded broadcasts of Chairman Mao's opening remarks and the reports and speeches of various committee members and representatives.

Chairman Mao said in his opening remarks: "The great struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea is still continuing and must continue until the U.S. government is willing to resolve it peacefully." This great call has become a tremendous force encouraging CPVA commanders and fighters to carry out the war against aggression more bravely. Hu Gui, deputy company commander of the Fifth Company of a certain unit, said: "Chairman Mao's opening remarks greatly encouraged us. Just as Chairman Mao pointed out, the war we are waging 'is completely necessary and completely just'; therefore, we have achieved and will continue to achieve victory. We must respond to Chairman Mao's call with the utmost loyalty, dedicate all our strength to the sacred war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and fight to the end to strive for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue!" Li Xueqing, deputy company commander of a certain unit, said: "The reports of this conference have made us more deeply aware of the greatness of our motherland. The Chinese people have demonstrated iron-like unity and immense power in the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, which has further strengthened our courage to overcome difficulties and our confidence in achieving final victory. In the past year of fighting against aggression, we have become stronger and stronger, gained rich practical experience, and our equipment has also been greatly improved. We must warn U.S. imperialism: if it still wants to continue playing delaying tactics in the armistice negotiations and still wants to risk advancing northward, then what awaits it will definitely be an even greater defeat." Lan Zhiwu, a soldier of the Third Platoon of a certain unit, said: "This conference calls on the people of the whole country to increase production, practice thrift, and support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The people of the motherland are so concerned about our operations at the front, we must stand more firmly at the forefront of defending the motherland and defending peace, not hesitate to shed blood and sacrifice, not fear any hardship, and use our greatest strength to strike at the U.S. aggressors!" CPVA commanders and fighters also unanimously stated: Du Ping, the representative of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, has expressed our will and determination in his speech at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the CPPCC. In the future, we will overcome difficulties with the greatest perseverance and thoroughly complete the glorious task of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea entrusted to us by the people of the motherland, to defend our infinitely beautiful motherland, and to defend peace in the East and the world.

    拥护人民政协全国委员会会议的报告决议
    【新华社朝鲜前线九日电】中国人民志愿军指挥员战斗员热烈拥护中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议的各项报告和决议。在这次会议期间，志愿军指挥员战斗员们在军营中都按时围集在收音机旁边，全神贯注地倾听毛主席的开会词和各委员、各代表的报告、发言的录音广播。
    毛主席在开会词中说：“抗美援朝的伟大斗争现在还在继续进行，并且必须继续进行到美国政府愿意和平解决的时候为止。”这个伟大的号召，已经成为鼓舞志愿军指挥员战斗员更加英勇地进行反侵略战争的巨大力量。某部第五连副连长胡贵说：“毛主席的开会词极大地鼓舞了我们，正如毛主席所指出的：我们所进行的战争‘是完全必要的和完全正义的’；因此，我们取得了并将继续取得胜利。我们要用最大的忠诚来响应毛主席的号召，把我们的一切力量贡献给神圣的抗美援朝战争，为争取和平解决朝鲜问题而奋斗到底！”某部副连长李学卿说：“这次会议的各项报告，使我们更加深刻地认识到我们祖国的伟大。祖国人民在抗美援朝斗争中表现出钢铁般的团结和巨大无比的力量，这样就更加强了我们克服困难的勇气和取得最后胜利的信心。我们在一年来的反侵略斗争中已经愈战愈强，取得了丰富的实战经验，而且装备也已大大地得到改善。我们要警告美帝国主义：假使它还想继续在停战谈判中玩弄拖延手段，还想冒险向北进犯，那么，等着它的将必定是更大的失败。”某部三排的战士蓝至武说：“这次会议号召全国人民增加生产，厉行节约，支持中国人民志愿军。祖国人民这样关心我们在前方的作战，我们一定要更坚决地站在保卫祖国、保卫和平的最前列，不惜流血牺牲，不怕任何艰苦，用最大的力量打击美国侵略者！”志愿军指挥员战斗员们并一致表示：中国人民志愿军代表杜平在人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议上的发言，已经集中地表示了我们的意志和决心。我们今后当以最大的毅力，克服困难，彻底完成祖国人民交给我们的抗美援朝的光荣任务，保卫我们无限美好的祖国，保卫东方和世界的和平。
