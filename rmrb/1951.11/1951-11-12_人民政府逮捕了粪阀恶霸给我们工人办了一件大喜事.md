　　Editor: On the evening of the 3rd, we held a temporary emergency meeting. When we heard at the meeting that those heinous manure barons, local bullies and counter-revolutionaries had been arrested by the People's Government, we were extremely happy and spontaneously started singing. Everyone said that the government did the right thing and did a great happy thing for us workers. We finally got our revenge, and it was more refreshing than eating a cold persimmon. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can we remove the big stone that has been pressing on our heads for so many years. We resolutely support the government's decree on reforming the manure disposal system. All of us workers guarantee to further improve the sanitation work in Beijing, protect the health of the people of the city, and repay the kindness of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao with good results, and thank our People's Government.
        All workers of the Second Branch of the Beijing Manure Industry Workers Union

　　人民政府逮捕了粪阀恶霸给我们工人办了一件大喜事
    编辑同志：我们在三日晚上召开了临时紧急会议。当我们在会上听到那些罪大恶极的粪阀恶霸、反革命分子，已被人民政府逮捕起来的消息时，大家痛快极了，都自动地唱起歌来。大家都说政府办得对，给咱们工人办了一件大喜事。我们可出了气啦，比吃了凉柿子还痛快。只有在共产党和毛主席的领导下，我们才把多少年来压在我们头上的大石头搬掉。我们坚决拥护政府改革粪道制度的法令。我们全体工人保证更进一步把北京市的清洁卫生工作搞好，保护全市人民的健康，拿好成绩回答共产党和毛主席的恩情，感谢我们的人民政府。
