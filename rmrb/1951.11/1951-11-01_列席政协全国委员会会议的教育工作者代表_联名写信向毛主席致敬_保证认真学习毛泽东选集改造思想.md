Education Workers Attending the CPPCC National Committee Meeting
Jointly Write a Letter to Chairman Mao to Pay Respects
Guaranteeing to Study the Selected Works of Mao Zedong and Transform Their Thinking

Respected Chairman Mao:

With incomparable excitement, we are attending the National Committee Meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. This was something we couldn't even dream of in the old society. We deeply realize that only under the great leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and your brilliant guidance can we be bestowed with the glorious title of People's Teacher!

We unanimously agree with and wholeheartedly support your opening remarks, as well as the reports by Premier Zhou and other leaders, and we are determined to study them in depth and earnestly implement them.

We all feel that our contributions to the people are too small. Compared to the People's Volunteers and the model workers in industry and agriculture, we are far behind; yet we have received such glory, making us even more ashamed! In the future, we can only strive to be a Ma Hengchang, Hao Jianxiu, or Li Shunda in the people's education cause through our greatest efforts. We hereby guarantee to you:

1.  We will earnestly study the Selected Works of Mao Zedong to transform our non-proletarian thinking. We will use the method of criticism and self-criticism to conduct self-transformation and self-education, and strive to make this movement a mass movement of all teachers, laying a good foundation for our country to achieve democratic reforms in all aspects and gradually implement industrialization.

2.  We will continue to carry out patriotic education in depth. Without hindering work and health, we will increase production, practice thrift, and strive to promote this to the masses, so that the Resist America, Aid Korea, and economic construction efforts can be done even better. We will strive for every teacher to become a good propagandist among the broad masses, systematically propagating the theory and practice of the Chinese revolution, promoting the beautiful prospects of our motherland, and strengthening national self-esteem and self-confidence, so as to thoroughly eliminate imperialist influence in China.

3.  We will implement the new education system with revolutionary spirit and methods, and develop the people's education cause. We will continuously improve teaching methods and vigorously cultivate various construction talents to overcome our current difficulties in lacking various construction talents.

All of the above are the glorious tasks that we, as people's teachers, should undertake. We are determined to accomplish these tasks to respond to the glory you have given us! On behalf of the education workers across the country, we pay our respects to you and wish you eternal good health!

    列席政协全国委员会会议的教育工作者代表
    联名写信向毛主席致敬
    保证认真学习毛泽东选集改造思想敬爱的毛主席：
    我们以无比兴奋的心情，列席中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会会议，这在旧社会是做梦也梦不到的事情。我们深深体会到，只有在伟大的中国共产党和您的英明领导下，我们才会得到人民教师这个光荣的称号！
    我们一致同意并衷心地拥护您的开会词，周总理及各位首长的报告，并坚决地深入学习，认真地贯彻执行。
    我们共同地感到对人民的贡献太小，要同人民志愿军和工农劳动模范比起来，就差得太远了；但又受到这样的光荣，因而更觉得惭愧！今后我们只有以最大的努力，争取在人民教育事业中作一个马恒昌、郝建秀、李顺达。特向您保证：
    一、认真学习毛泽东选集，来改造我们的非无产阶级思想，以批评与自我批评的方法，来进行自我改造和自我教育，并努力使这个运动成为全体教师的群众性的运动，给我们国家在各方面实现民主改革和逐步实行工业化打下良好的基础。
    二、继续深入进行爱国主义教育，在不妨碍工作和身体健康的原则下，来增加生产，厉行节约，并努力向群众宣传，使抗美援朝，经济建设做得更好。争取每个教师在广大群众中成为一个好的宣传员，有系统地宣传中国革命的理论和实际，宣传我们祖国的美好远景，加强民族自尊心和自信心，来彻底肃清帝国主义在中国的影响。
    三、用革命的精神和办法，实行新学制，发展人民教育事业。不断地改进教学方法，大力培养各种建设人材，克服我们当前缺少各项建设人材的困难。
    以上这些事情，都是我们作一个人民教师所应负担的光荣任务。我们决心要完成这些任务，来回答您给我们的光荣！我们代表全国教育工作者向您致敬，并祝您的身体永远健康！中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议教育工作者列席代表：
