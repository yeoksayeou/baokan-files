　　Strive for Victory in the Political and Current Affairs Study of 35 Million Farmers This Winter
    The winter study movement, in which 35 million farmers will participate, has already begun or will soon begin nationwide. Winter study is the center for attracting male and female farmers to participate in political and cultural activities, and it is an extremely important organizational form for systematically conducting patriotic education among farmers. On November 11th, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government issued instructions, clearly stating that this year's winter study should strengthen the content of political and current affairs education.
    In order to strengthen the political and current affairs education of this year's winter study, all localities must prevent the tendency that existed in some places in the past to simply emphasize cultural learning and neglect political and current affairs education for farmers. Some people only see the farmers' demands for cultural learning and ignore their demands for political learning. They fail to deeply recognize the great significance of conducting political education among the farmers, and therefore one-sidedly regard literacy as the only content of winter study teaching, and even mistakenly believe that conducting political education will hinder cultural learning, and put political education in opposition to cultural learning, so that the working class (through the Communist Party) cannot use this important tool of winter study to strengthen its political leadership over the farmers. They do not understand that learning culture is for the purpose of further learning politics, nor do they understand that without the support of the farmers' political enthusiasm, the winter study movement and cultural education work cannot be truly done well.
    In order to strengthen the political and current affairs education of this year's winter study, we should also never neglect the farmers' demand for cultural learning, and relax cultural literacy education, only satisfying ourselves with oral propaganda and mobilization work. Our political and current affairs education has very rich and vivid content, which cannot be replaced by simply talking about some empty political slogans. In order to prevent the occurrence of this tendency, it is necessary to gradually solve the problem of political teaching materials and teachers for winter study in a planned way. The issue of teachers is a question of success or failure in strengthening political and current affairs education in winter study. Without a large number of teachers who have sufficient patriotic enthusiasm and a correct understanding of current political and current affairs issues, it is impossible to strengthen political and current affairs education in winter studies involving 35 million farmers. The Central Ministry of Education's instructions put forward this issue and the solution, and some localities have already paid attention to training winter study teachers and providing them with necessary teaching materials, which is correct and necessary.
    This year's winter study is an important task for continuing to deepen patriotic education in the countryside. However, some comrades say: "We are already too busy with the current work, and now we have to run winter studies, how can we do it?" They believe that winter study work hinders the central work, that winter study work is irrelevant to the central work, and is only a matter for the cultural and educational departments. This view is wrong. Winter study work not only does not conflict with the central work, but also has a close connection. Through the propaganda and education of winter study, the progress of various central works can be promoted; and winter study that is not combined with the current central work cannot be welcomed by the farmers.

### 争取今冬三千五百万农民政治时事学习的胜利

　　争取今冬三千五百万农民政治时事学习的胜利
    将有三千五百万农民参加学习的冬学运动已经在全国范围内开始或很快就要开始了。冬学是吸引男女农民群众参加政治活动和文化活动的中心，是目前向农民群众有系统地进行爱国主义教育的一个极为重要的组织形式。十一月十一日中央人民政府教育部已经发出了指示，明确提出今年冬学要加强政治时事教育的内容。
    为了加强今年冬学的政治时事教育，各地从一开始就要防止过去某些地方存在的单纯强调文化学习，忽视对农民进行政治时事教育的偏向。有的人只看到农民文化学习的要求，忽视了农民政治学习的要求，没有深切认识到向农民群众进行政治教育的重大意义，因而片面地把识字作为冬学教学的唯一内容，甚至错误地认为进行政治教育会妨碍文化学习，把政治教育和文化学习对立起来，使工人阶级（经过共产党）不能利用冬学这个重要的工具去加强对农民的政治领导。他们不懂得学习文化是为了达到进一步学习政治的目的，也不懂得冬学运动得不到农民群众的政治热情的支持，文化教育工作也无法真正作好。
    为了加强今年冬学的政治时事教育，同时也决不应该忽视农民群众学习文化的要求，而放松文化识字教育，只满足于口头宣传鼓动工作。我们的政治时事教育有着十分丰富生动的内容，决不是单单讲述一些空洞的政治口号可以代替的。为了防止这种偏向的发生，就必须有计划地逐渐地解决冬学的政治教材和师资问题。师资问题是加强冬学政治时事教育的一个成败问题。没有大批有着充分的爱国热情和对于当前政治时事问题有着正确了解的教师，要想在有三千五百万农民参加的冬学中加强政治时事教育是不可能的。中央教育部指示中提出了这个问题和解决的办法，有些地方已经注意了训练冬学教师并供给他们必要的教材，这是正确的，必要的。
    今年的冬学，是目前继续深入农村爱国主义教育的一项重要的工作。但是，有些同志却说：“现在的工作已经忙不过来了，又要办冬学，怎样能做得了呢？”他们认为冬学工作是妨害中心工作的，认为冬学工作与中心工作无关，只是文教部门的事。这种看法是错误的。冬学工作不但与中心工作没有矛盾，而且有着密切的联系。通过冬学的宣传教育可以推动各种中心工作的进行；而不和当前中心工作结合进行的冬学，也不可能得到农民群众的欢迎。
