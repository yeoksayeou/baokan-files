Preparing for the Prevention and Control of Plant Diseases and Insect Pests
Sun Ziying, Deputy Director of the Agricultural, Forestry, and Water Conservancy Department of the Financial and Economic Work Committee of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

I. The Occurrence of Crop Diseases and Insect Pests in North China This Year and the Estimate for Next Year

This year, the area of farmland in North China affected by various crop diseases and insect pests was no less than 40 million mu. Through active prevention and control, significant losses were avoided. However, we must understand that due to insufficient rainfall in the North China region, which is prone to drought, conditions are suitable for the breeding of diseases and pests. Furthermore, the elimination efforts in some areas this year were not thorough enough, and autumn plowing, egg-digging, insect-picking, and stubble-clearing have not been fully implemented. Therefore, the diseases and pests that occurred this year are likely to reoccur next year. We should adhere to the spirit of "prevention is better than cure" and "preventing disasters every year, and controlling insects at all times," striving to "prevent early, treat early, control universally, treat continuously, and eradicate thoroughly," and aim to detect and eliminate pests at any time.

II. Specific Requirements and Prevention Methods

The general requirement for preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests next year is to reduce their occurrence and minimize losses compared to this year. This requires us to strive to prevent locusts, cotton aphids, red spiders, fruit insects (insects on fruit trees), and black穗病 from becoming disasters next year, as we have confidence in controlling them (multiple prevention methods and sufficient supply of pesticides). For stem borers, cutworms, mole crickets, and wheat take-all, which are less certain to be controlled, we should strive to reduce their harm to the minimum within three years. For wireworms, cotton red drought, wheat stem smut, and other diseases and pests for which no or few prevention methods have been researched, we should conduct planned experiments next year and minimize losses as much as possible. We believe that the above requirements can be achieved because government leading organs and the broad masses of peasants at all levels have rich experience in preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests. At the same time, the supply of pesticides and machinery is increasing year by year, and the funds invested in preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests next year will be several times higher than this year. If various regions can start early and earnestly carry out prevention and control, the above requirements can be realized.

This year, governments and peasants in various parts of North China have created many methods for preventing and controlling several major diseases and insect pests. Among these methods, those that have proven effective should be widely promoted; those that have proven ineffective should be discontinued; and the experience of the masses should be summarized, and indigenous methods and local pesticides should be identified. For the prevention and control of certain diseases and insect pests for which no methods have been researched for the time being, active research and experimentation should be carried out. Now, in order to enable everyone to start early to prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests, the existing methods in various parts of North China are summarized and introduced as follows:

Effective methods for preventing and controlling cotton aphids and red spiders are: (1) Universally launch autumn plowing and winter plowing, which is an effective method for preventing insects, preventing drought, and increasing production; (2) Clean up rotten cotton bolls and rotten cotton leaves in cotton fields, and remove weeds (dig them out by the roots and burn them) in fields, along field edges, roadsides, and ditches; (3) Do not intercrop beans in wheat and cotton fields (because bean crops easily spread red spiders); (4) Use pesticides for spraying. For pesticides to control cotton aphids, the future goal should be to develop tobacco leaf water. Facts have proved that tobacco leaf water is highly effective, harmless, and easy to obtain. However, the amount of tobacco leaves available for pest control in the North China region is not enough. Next year, local tobacco should be planted in proportion to one percent of the cotton field area for future use. In the case where there is not enough tobacco leaf water, cotton oil soap is still the main product to be promoted in various places. Pay attention to unified specifications when promoting it in order to exert its efficacy. Effective and harmless local medicines should also be fully utilized, such as bitter tree root bark, Yangtao root bark, etc. As for ineffective or harmful local medicines, such as wheat bran water, wild garlic water, wild leek water, chili water, etc., their use should be discontinued. The effective pesticide for preventing and controlling red spiders is lime-sulfur mixture, which can be supplemented with flour paste water and tobacco leaf water; cotton oil soap is not suitable for use, because it is ineffective if the concentration is too light, and harmful if it is too heavy.

Methods for controlling locusts: Eliminate wasteland and grasslands, level ditches and fortifications, and eliminate their breeding grounds. Winter plowing should be carried out universally this winter. During winter plowing, earnestly organize the masses to dig up locust eggs, or check the eggs and insert markers, so as to eliminate them early next spring. Experience has shown that to control locusts, it is best to strive to eliminate them quickly during the nymph stage. The method for eliminating locust nymphs should combine pesticide spraying with manual removal. Such as digging blockade ditches or head-on ditches, letting them fall in by themselves and then killing them; in grasslands and wastelands, they can be compressed into a small area and burned to death; in cultivated land, grass can also be piled up in advance, driving the nymphs in and burning them; or use the characteristics of nymphs walking towards people, dig good ditches and lead the nymphs into the ditches; under conditions of sufficient manpower, encirclement and suppression methods can be adopted. It is more difficult to catch and beat flying locusts, so take advantage of the dampness in the morning and evening, when locusts are less active, or at noon when they lay eggs, to catch and encircle them, and use lights to trap them at night.

Effective methods for controlling fruit insects are: (1) Scrape off the old bark of pear, jujube, and hawthorn trees in early spring. (2) Spray five-degree lime-sulfur mixture before the fruit trees sprout (including various fruit trees). (3) Spray 50% wettable DDT 100 times liquid before and after flowering, which can control major pests such as hairy caterpillars, pear stink bugs, plum hairy caterpillars, pear tigers, Japanese beetles, and apple nest worms. (4) Use tobacco water (with adhesive) to treat various fruit tree aphids. (5) Spray five-degree lime-sulfur mixture before grape buds sprout, and Bordeaux lead arsenate mixture after sprouting. (6) Spray 50% wettable DDT 300 times liquid after jujube trees sprout, which can control jujube leaf beetles and jujube fruit borers. (7) In autumn, tie grass to attract and kill overwintering large and small codling moths. The above are all effective methods to fundamentally solve fruit insects.

There are also prevention and control methods for several kinds of pests that often harm crops, as well as wheat take-all and black穗病. Stem borers are very harmful, but because they are scattered, they are often not noticed. There are many existing prevention methods, which must be widely promoted among the masses. The methods are to pick up stubble and burn stubble, seal grain stalks with mud, pull out and burn harmful plants, collect leaves with eggs, and can try light trapping (this method can bring insect moths from many areas into one place to eliminate them). The most effective way to eliminate mole crickets is to mix pesticides with seeds, use poisoned bait or manure to attract and kill them, and you can also try light trapping. To prevent and control cutworms, pick up insects in combination with autumn plowing, remove weeds before May, or pile up grass to lure and kill them. To control Japanese beetles, take measures such as autumn plowing to pick up insects, catch them, trap them with fire, and plant hemp seeds (this insect is anesthetized after eating the leaves, making it easy to catch). There are not many existing methods for preventing and controlling wireworms, the main one is to use "666" to mix with seeds to eliminate them. Selecting, soaking, and mixing seeds have little effect on the prevention and control of wheat take-all, but they have a certain effect. The most effective method at present is: starting from the discovery of white tips in the field, pull the white tips once every eight days, and after pulling four times in a row, it can be cured. Secondly, promote the use of cooked fertilizer (animal manure must be rotten), and promote a two-year rotation system according to the specific situation.

Soaking and mixing seeds is the most effective method for preventing and controlling wheat black穗病. Wash the seeds five times with cold water, which also has a considerable effect on eliminating seed-borne black穗病. Scalding seeds with boiling water is dangerous and should not be advocated. In addition to Ceresan, sulfur powder mixed with seeds is also very effective in preventing and controlling wheat hard smut, and its use should be vigorously promoted. Within one or two years, we should strive to completely replace wine-mixing seeds, and we can choose disease-resistant improved varieties, remove diseased plants, and promote the seed retention land system.

    作好防治病虫害的准备工作
    中共中央华北局财经工作委员会农林水利处副处长  孙子英
    一、今年华北农田病虫害发生
        的情况和明年的估计
    今年华北区各种农作物发生病虫害的不下四千万亩，经过积极防治，没有造成很大损失。但是我们必须了解，由于华北地区的雨量不足，常患干旱，适宜病虫害的繁殖；加之有些地方今年除治不够彻底，秋耕、挖卵、拾虫、灭茬等工作尚未全面展开，因此，今年发生的病虫害，明年仍可能再度发生。我们应本着“有备无患”“年年防灾、时时防虫”的精神，作到“早防、早治、普治、连治、根治”，争取作到随时发现虫害，随时即可消灭。
    二、具体要求和防治办法
    明年防治病虫害的总的要求是要比今年发生的少，损失的轻。这就要求我们对于有把握（防治办法多，药剂也能充分供应）防治的蝗虫、棉蚜、红蜘蛛、果虫（果木树上的虫）、黑穗病等，要争取作到明年不使成灾。对于防治把握不大的钻心虫、切根虫、蝼蛄、白发病等，要争取于三年内使其危害减少至最低限度。对于目前尚未研究出防治办法或办法少的金针虫、棉花红旱，小麦秆黑粉病等，要于明年作有计划的试验，并尽量减少损失。上述要求，我们认为是可以作到的。因为各级政府领导机关和广大农民群众已有丰富的防治病虫害的经验，同时药械的供应也逐年增加，明年投资于防治病虫害的经费也超过今年数倍，如果各地能及早动手，认真进行防治，上述要求是能够实现的。
    今年华北区各地政府和农民对几种主要病虫害的防治，已经创造出很多办法。在这些办法中，已证明有效的，应即普遍推广；对于已证明无效的，应停止使用；同时要总结群众经验，鉴定土法土药。对某些病虫害的防治，一时还没有研究出办法的，则应积极研究试验。现为使大家及早动手防治病虫害，特将华北各地已有的办法综合介绍如下：
    防治棉蚜和红蜘蛛的有效办法是：（一）普遍发动秋耕、冬耕，这是防虫、防旱、增产的有效办法；（二）清理棉田中的烂棉桃、烂棉叶，铲除田间、地边、道旁、水沟上的杂草（要连根刨出，用火烧毁）；（三）在麦田棉田里不间作豆类作物（因豆类作物容易传布红蜘蛛）；（四）运用药剂喷治。对于除治棉蚜的药剂，今后的目标应发展烟叶水。事实证明，烟叶水效力大，无药害，取材也方便。但目前华北区防治虫害的烟叶还不够用。明年应按棉田面积百分之一的比例种植土烟，以便今后运用。在烟叶还不够用的情形下，目前各地主要还是推广棉油皂。推广时要注意统一规格，以便发挥药效。对有效无害的土药，也应充分利用，如苦树根皮，杨桃根皮等。至于无效或有害的土药，如麦糠水、野蒜水、野韭水、辣椒水等，应停止使用。防治红蜘蛛的有效药剂是石灰硫磺合剂，并可辅之以面糊水和烟叶水；棉油皂则不宜使用，因其浓度轻了无效，重了有害。
    防治蝗虫的办法：要消灭荒滩草地，平沟平碉，消灭其寄生场所。今冬要普遍进行冬耕。冬耕时要认真组织群众挖蝗卵，或查卵插标，以便明春及早消灭。经验证明：为了防治蝗虫，争取在蝻子阶段迅速消灭，是一个最好的办法。对蝗蝻的除治方法，应该是药械喷杀与人力除治相结合。如挖封锁沟或迎头沟，让其自行掉入然后打死；在草滩荒地中，可将其压缩在小范围内用火烧杀；在耕地中，亦可事先堆草，将蝻子赶入，用火焚烧；或利用蝻子迎人走的特性，挖好沟道，把蝻子领入沟中；在人力充裕条件下，更可采用围剿方法。飞蝗捕打较难，利用早晚潮湿，飞蝗行动不便或中午产卵时，进行捕捉、围歼，并可在夜晚用灯火诱捕。
    对果虫防治的有效办法是：（一）在初春刮除梨、枣、沙果的老树皮。（二）在果树未发芽前喷射五度石灰硫磺合剂（包括各种果树）。（三）开花前后喷射百分之五十可湿性滴滴涕一百倍液，可治星毛虫，梨椿象、梅毛虫、梨虎、姬金龟子，苹果巢虫等主要害虫。（四）用烟草水（加粘着剂）治各种果树蚜虫。（五）葡萄发芽前，喷五度石灰硫磺合剂，发芽后喷波尔多砒酸铅合剂。（六）枣树发芽后喷射百分之五十可湿性滴滴涕三百倍液，可治枣步曲及枣实虫。（七）秋季束草诱杀越冬大小食心虫。以上均为基本解决果虫的有效办法。
    在农作物中经常为害的几种害虫和白发病、黑穗病等，也已有了防治办法。钻心虫为害很大，但因其分散，往往不为人注意。现有的防治办法已很多，必须在群众中普遍推广。其方法是拾茬烧茬，泥封谷草，拔烧害株，采带卵的叶，并可试行灯火诱杀（用此法可把许多地区虫蛾引入一块地中消灭）。消灭蝼蛄的最有效办法是药剂拌种，用毒饵或粪土诱杀，亦可试行灯火诱杀。为了防除切根虫，结合秋耕进行拾虫，五月前除尽杂草，或堆草诱杀。防治金龟子可采取秋耕拾虫、捕捉、点火诱杀，种植大麻子（此虫吃叶后即麻醉，易于捕捉）等办法。防治金针虫，现有的办法不多，主要是用“六六六”拌种消灭。选种、浸种、拌种对白发病的防治，效力不大，但有一定作用。目前最有效的办法是：自田间发现白尖起，每隔八天拔白尖一次，连拔四次，就可除治。其次是提倡使用熟肥（牲口粪要沤烂），并可就具体情况，推行二年轮作制。
    浸种拌种是防治小麦黑穗病最有效的办法。以凉水把种子淘洗五次，对消灭种籽传染的黑穗病也有相当效果。开水烫种有危险性，不宜提倡。防治麦类坚黑穗病，除赛力散外，用硫磺粉拌种也有特效，要大量提倡使用。在一、二年内，要争取完全代替用酒拌种，并可选择抗病良种，拔除病株，推广留种地制度。
