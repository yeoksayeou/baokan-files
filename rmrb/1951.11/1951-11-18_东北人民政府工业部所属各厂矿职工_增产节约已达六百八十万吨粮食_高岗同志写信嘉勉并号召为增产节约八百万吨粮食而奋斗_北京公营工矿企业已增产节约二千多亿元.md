　　Workers of Factories and Mines Under the Northeast People's Government's Department of Industry
    Increased Production and Savings Reach 6.8 Million Tons of Grain
    Comrade Gao Gang Writes a Letter of Commendation and Calls for Striving to Increase Production and Savings to 8 Million Tons of Grain
    Publicly Owned Industrial and Mining Enterprises in Beijing Increase Production and Savings by Over 200 Billion Yuan
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The workers of the factories and mines under the Northeast People's Government's Department of Industry had, by the end of September, increased production and saved wealth equivalent to 6.8 million tons of grain. Wang Heshou, Minister of the Department, and Vice Ministers Lü Dong and An Zhiwen, wrote to Chairman Gao Gang on November 12 to report the good news. The letter stated: "In response to your call for increasing production and saving 5 million tons of grain, all the staff and workers of the Department have been working hard in various aspects for the past six months, and have achieved certain results. According to statistics from January to September, the completed figure for the tasks of increasing production and saving in the factories and mines under our department has reached 6,801,538 tons of grain, exceeding the task you gave us by 36.03 percent, accounting for 97.86 percent of our Department's first plan (6.95 million tons), and 86.98 percent of the second plan (7.82 million tons). At present, all our staff and workers are making unremitting efforts to strengthen workshop work in order to strive for more over-fulfillment of the task of increasing production and saving. We believe that under the leadership of the Party and the government, relying on the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, the great task of increasing production and saving can be completed and over-fulfilled."
    Chairman Gao Gang replied in a letter: "All the staff and workers of the factories and mines under the Northeast People's Government's Department of Industry have increased production and saved wealth equivalent to 6,801,538 tons of grain by the end of September. This greatly exceeds the task of increasing production and saving 5 million tons of grain that was proposed to you at the Northeast Bureau's urban work conference. This is a concrete manifestation of the leading role of the working class in the national construction cause under the leadership of the great Chairman Mao, and a concrete result of the combination of political work and economic work in factories. The working class has actively responded to Chairman Mao's call with such creative labor, further strengthening our national defense and economic strength. This is the glory of all the staff and workers and all the cadres of the Northeast People's Government's Department of Industry!
    I hope that you will not be arrogant or rash, but strive to complete the task of increasing production and saving 8 million tons of grain. At the same time, I also hope that the leading organs and all the staff and workers of state-owned enterprises and local industries in the Northeast can, like the Department of Industry, strive to complete and over-fulfill the plan for increasing production and saving ahead of schedule!"
     [Xinhua News Agency, 17th Dispatch] In the increased production and savings campaign from January to September this year, twenty of Beijing's larger state-owned and municipal industrial and mining enterprises have created over 210 billion yuan worth of wealth for the country. In this movement, the broad masses of workers have fully displayed their enthusiasm and creativity, enabling many production plans to be completed and over-fulfilled ahead of schedule. The team of Liu Dezhen, a model worker at the Shijingshan Power Plant, alone increased production and saved the country over 47 million yuan in the three months of July, August, and September by adopting methods such as repairing two generators ahead of schedule, adding a filter oil machine, and proposing eleven rationalization proposals. The production volume of the Liulihe Cement Plant in August alone was equal to one-quarter of the total production during the year and a half of Japanese occupation, and one-half of the total production during the two years and nine months of Chiang Kai-shek's rule. In this month, the workers of the plant created over 535 million yuan of excess wealth for the country.
    Now, under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, the city's workers are displaying a high degree of patriotism, actively formulating plans for increasing production and saving in the fourth quarter of this year and the next year, and are working hard to realize and exceed these plans.

　　东北人民政府工业部所属各厂矿职工
    增产节约已达六百八十万吨粮食
    高岗同志写信嘉勉并号召为增产节约八百万吨粮食而奋斗
    北京公营工矿企业已增产节约二千多亿元
    【本报讯】东北人民政府工业部所属各厂矿职工，已于九月底增产节约了价值六百八十万吨粮食的财富。该部王鹤寿部长，吕东、安志文副部长于十一月十二日写信向高岗主席报捷。信中说：“工业部全体职工响应您的号召，为增产节约五百万吨粮食任务，半年来努力进行了各方面的工作，已收到一定的结果。根据一至九月份统计，我部所属各厂矿增产节约任务的完成数字已达六、八○一、五三八吨粮食，超过您所给的任务百分之三六·○三，为我部第一次计划（六百九十五万吨）的百分之九七·八六，为第二次计划（七百八十二万吨）的百分之八六·九八。目前我们全体职工正在以加强车间工作为争取更多的超额完成增产节约任务做不懈的努力。我们相信，在党与政府的领导下，依靠广大职工同志的积极性，增产节约这一伟大任务，是可以完成与超额完成的。”
    高岗主席复信说：“东北人民政府工业部所属厂矿的全体职工，已于九月底增产节约了价值六百八十万一千五百三十八吨粮食。这样就大大地超过了在东北局城市工作会议上向你们所提出的增产节约价值五百万吨粮食的任务。这是在伟大的毛主席的领导下工人阶级在国家建设事业中领导作用的具体表现，是工厂中政治工作与经济工作相结合的具体结果。工人阶级以这种创造性的劳动，积极地响应了毛主席的号召，进一步加强了我们的国防力量与经济力量，这是东北人民政府工业部所属全体职工、全体干部的光荣！
    我希望你们不骄不躁为完成增产节约八百万吨粮食的任务而奋斗。同时我也希望东北各国营企业与地方工业的领导机关与全体职工，都能像工业部一样，争取提前并超额完成增产节约的计划！”
     【新华社十七日讯】北京市二十个国营和市营规模较大的工矿企业，在今年一月至九月的增产节约运动中，已为国家多创造了价值二千一百多亿元的财富。在这一运动中，广大的职工群众都充分地发挥了积极性和创造性，使得许多生产计划提前并超额完成。仅石景山发电厂劳动模范刘德珍的一个小组，他们因为采取了提前修复两台发电机、增修一台滤油机和提出十一件合理化建议等方法，在七、八、九三个月中即为国家增产节约了四千七百多万元。琉璃河水泥厂八月份一个月的生产量，即等于日寇统治一年半生产总量的四分之一，等于蒋匪统治两年零九个月生产总量的二分之一。在这一个月里，该厂职工为国家创造了五亿三千五百多万元的超额财富。
    现在全市职工正依照着毛主席的指示，在中国共产党北京市委会的领导下，发挥高度的爱国主义精神，积极制订今年第四季度及明年度的增产节约计划，并为实现以及超过这些计划而努力。
