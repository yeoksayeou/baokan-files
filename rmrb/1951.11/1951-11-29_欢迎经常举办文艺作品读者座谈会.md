    Welcome Regularly Held Literary Works Reader Symposiums
    Editor: I have twice participated in the Beijing Library's reader symposiums on the novels "Plain Flames" and "Heroes of Lüliang." After listening to the authors Xu Guangyao and Ma Feng's reports on their writing processes, I received great ideological enlightenment and education. I deeply feel that only by transforming oneself ideologically and emotionally can one profoundly understand the new qualities of new characters in literary works. A self-serving and profit-driven person cannot understand characters with noble qualities, nor will they ever correctly create images of outstanding Communist Party members. In the past, I lacked understanding in this regard, often focusing unilaterally on the techniques of the work and not paying enough attention to its ideological content. When reading works, I did not seek education from them, but simply "appreciated" them. I will correct this erroneous view in the future.
    I believe that the Beijing Library's practice of recommending excellent literary works through symposiums is a very good method. After such discussions, the infection and educational effect of the work on readers far exceeds the gains of individual reading; for writers, this is also an effective method to extensively absorb readers' opinions. This method is worthy of promotion and popularization. 　Li Qiufa

    欢迎经常举办文艺作品读者座谈会
    编辑同志：我曾两次参加北京市图书馆举办的小说“平原烈火”“吕梁英雄传”的读者座谈会。在我听了作者徐光耀、马烽的关于创作的报告以后，思想上受到很大的启示和教育。我深深感到，只有从思想感情上改造自己，才能深刻理解文艺作品中的新人物的新品质，一个利欲薰心的自私自利者，既不可能理解具有崇高品质的人物，也永远不会正确地创作出优秀的共产党员的形象来。过去，在这方面我缺乏认识，经常片面注意作品的技巧，不大注意作品的思想性。我阅读作品不是想从中得到一些教育，而是单纯地为了“欣赏”。今后我要纠正这种错误看法。
    我认为北京市图书馆经常以座谈会方式来推荐优秀的文艺作品，是一个很好的方法。经过这样的讨论，作品对读者的感染力和教育效果远远超过个人阅读的收获；对于作家，这也是一个可以大量吸取读者意见的有效方法。这种方法，是值得提倡和推广的。　李秋发
