Shaanxi Xingping Farmer Gong Weizhou
Implements Crop Rotation Method to Increase Wheat Yield

The Gong Weizhou mutual aid team in Xigong Village, Xingping County, Shaanxi Province, has greatly increased the per-unit-area yield of wheat on dry land that only yields one harvest a year by adopting an alfalfa-wheat rotation method. The Gong Weizhou mutual aid team planted 30.03 mu of dry land wheat last winter, and this summer the average yield per mu was 310 jin, exceeding the local average yield by 90 percent; among which, three mu of land, due to the team’s special processing and meticulous farming and heavy fertilization, had a yield equivalent to 855 jin per mu. In addition, the group's irrigated wheat fields yielded 675 jin per mu, setting a new record for wheat production in the Northwest region.

The main reason for the high wheat yield of the Gong Weizhou mutual aid team is that they adopted an alfalfa-wheat rotation method, and also paid great attention to intensive cultivation and fertilization. The alfalfa-wheat rotation method was created by Gong Weizhou from long-term wheat planting experience, with an eight-year cycle, and has become a system. The rotation sequence is: in the first year, alfalfa and wheat are mixed, and the young alfalfa branches and roots do not affect wheat growth that year. Therefore, in the second year, not only can wheat be harvested, but also alfalfa. In the third and fourth years, only alfalfa is harvested. In the autumn of the fourth year, the alfalfa is dug up, and wheat is planted in the winter, with three consecutive years of wheat harvest. In the autumn of the seventh year, buckwheat is planted instead, and rapeseed is intercropped in the buckwheat field. Rapeseed requires less nutrients, allowing the land to rest for a year. The harvest of rapeseed and buckwheat is similar to that of wheat. In the autumn of the eighth year, wheat is planted again, and after the wheat harvest in the ninth year, alfalfa and wheat are mixed again in the autumn, just like the first year. The roots of alfalfa have a large number of rhizobia, which can fix free nitrogen (nitrogen is an important fertilizer) from the air in the soil. The decaying branches and leaves left by alfalfa can make the soil more fertile. Each mu of alfalfa in this area can be exchanged for 200 jin of wheat each year, which has great economic value. Gong Weizhou has explored this rotation method for many years before liberation, and has also jointly trial-planted it with other farmers for eight years. As a result, the minimum wheat yield per mu each year exceeded the local average yield by more than 30 jin, proving that this method is generally applicable to dry land where wheat is planted only once a year. After liberation, they formally formed a mutual aid team and continued to implement the rotation. The Gong Weizhou mutual aid team pays great attention to deep plowing and meticulous farming when planting wheat. Before planting wheat, they generally plow the land deeply three times (seven inches deep), harrow four times, and roll five times, then sow shallowly (four inches deep); after sowing, if it rains, harrow once to prevent the surface soil from solidifying and hindering the emergence of wheat seedlings; before the ground freezes, hoe once to mound the soil to the roots of the wheat seedlings to prevent the seedlings from freezing. Their wheat fields are fertilized with five to ten large carts of base fertilizer per mu (1,000 jin per cart), and in the second spring, 10 jin of chemical fertilizer or two large carts of kang soil manure are used as top dressing per mu.

After being organized, Gong Weizhou's rotation method has exerted greater power. In the past, when he planted wheat alone, he could only plow four inches deep with a single-team plow (one ox), but after being organized, he could plow to seven inches deep with a double-team plow. Based on being organized, Gong Weizhou’s wheat planting method is an effective way to increase the yield per unit area of wheat. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 陕西兴平农民弓维舟  实行轮作法提高小麦产量

　　陕西兴平农民弓维舟
    实行轮作法提高小麦产量
    陕西省兴平县西弓村弓维舟互助组，采用苜蓿小麦轮种法，在一年只收一次的旱地上大大提高了小麦单位面积产量。弓维舟互助组去冬种旱地小麦三十亩零三分，今夏每亩平均产量三百一十斤，超过当地一般产量百分之九十；其中有三分地，由于互助组特别加工细作和大量施肥，折合每亩产量达八百五十五斤。另外，该组能够浇水灌溉的麦田，每亩产量六百七十五斤，创造了西北区小麦丰产的新纪录。
    弓维舟互助组小麦丰产的主要原因，是他们采用了一种苜蓿小麦轮作法，又很注意精耕细作和施肥。苜蓿小麦轮作法是弓维舟从长期种麦经验中创造的，八年一轮，已成制度。轮作的次序是：第一年苜蓿小麦混种，当年苜蓿枝根幼小，不影响小麦生长。因此第二年不但能收麦，还能收苜蓿。第三、四两年只收苜蓿。第四年秋季将苜蓿挖掉，冬季种上小麦，连收三年麦子后，第七年秋季改种荞麦，并在荞麦地中套种油菜。油菜所需的养料较少，可使地力休歇一年。油菜和荞麦的收获也和种麦差不多。第八年秋季又种麦，第九年收麦后，秋季又和第一年一样，实行小麦苜蓿混种。苜蓿根部有大量的根瘤菌，能把空气中的游离氮（氮是重要的肥料）固定在土壤中。苜蓿遗留的枝叶腐烂后，可使土壤更加肥沃。该地每年每亩苜蓿可换小麦二百斤，经济价值很大。这种轮作法，弓维舟在解放前已摸索多年，又曾和其他农民联合试种过八年，结果每年每亩小麦产量最低也超过当地一般产量三十斤以上，证明了这种方法可普遍适用于一年只种一次小麦的旱地。解放后，他们已正式组成互助组，继续实行轮作。弓维舟互助组种麦很注意深耕细作。他们种麦前要普遍将地深耕三遍（七寸深），耙四遍，耱五遍，然后浅种（四寸深）；播种后，如下雨就耙一次，以免表土凝结，阻碍麦苗出土；地冻以前要锄一次，将土壅到麦苗根部，防止麦苗受冻。他们的麦地，每亩施基肥五大车到十大车
    （每车一千斤），第二年春季每亩又用化学肥料十斤或炕土粪两大车作追肥。
    组织起来后，弓维舟的轮作法发挥了更大的力量。过去，他单独种麦时只能用单套犁（一个牛）犁四寸深，组织起来后用双套犁才犁到七寸深。在组织起来的基础上，弓维舟的种麦法是提高小麦单位面积产量的有效办法。（新华社）
