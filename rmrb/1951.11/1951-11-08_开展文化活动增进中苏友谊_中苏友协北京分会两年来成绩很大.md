Developing Cultural Activities to Enhance Sino-Soviet Friendship
The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Beijing Branch Achieves Great Results in Two Years

The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Beijing Branch has extensively conducted various cultural activities to strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship over the past two years. A total of 1,209 screenings of Soviet films were held, with an audience of 1,812,800; 35 kinds of books introducing the Soviet Union were published, totaling more than 160,000 copies; 893 Soviet photo exhibitions were held, with an audience of 876,000; 242 lectures on Sino-Soviet friendship and the introduction of the Soviet Union were held, with an audience of 206,000; 18 million yuan in book funds were allocated to help the branches of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association purchase books about the Soviet Union; and two Russian language radio courses were jointly organized with the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station, with more than 2,400 regular students. A Russian language night school was also opened in August this year.

The propaganda and education work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Beijing Branch has improved the understanding of the Soviet Union among the general public, making them more confident in building the motherland and resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. After seeing pictures of the Soviet Donbas coal mine, workers at the Mentougou Coal Mine said: "With Chairman Mao's leadership, our coal mine will soon be built as well as the Donbas coal mine. If we don't work hard to produce and strive to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, we won't be able to keep today's good life."

As of the end of September this year, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Beijing Branch had 323,192 members. In order to further strengthen mass Sino-Soviet friendship activities, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Beijing Branch established training classes for cadres of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in various districts. The first class of 798 students has already graduated. (Xinhua News Agency)

    开展文化活动增进中苏友谊
    中苏友协北京分会两年来成绩很大
    中苏友好协会北京市分会两年来广泛进行了各种加强中苏友谊的文化活动。总计放映了一千二百零九场苏联电影，观众有一百八十一万二千八百多人；出版了三十五种介绍苏联的书籍，共十六万多册；举行了八百九十三次苏联图片展览，观众有八十七万六千多人；举办了二百四十二次关于中苏友好和介绍苏联的讲演会，听众有二十万六千多人；拨发了一千八百万元的图书经费，帮助各中苏友好协会支会添购关于介绍苏联的书籍；和北京市人民广播电台共同举办了两期俄语广播讲授班，共有固定的学生二千四百多人。今年八月又开设了一个俄文夜校。
    中苏友好协会北京分会的宣传教育工作，提高了广大市民对苏联的认识，使得他们对建设祖国和抗美援朝更加充满信心。门头沟煤矿工人看了苏联顿巴斯煤矿图片后说：“有了毛主席的领导，咱们的煤矿很快就会建设成像顿巴斯煤矿一样好，咱们要不加油生产努力抗美援朝，就保不住今天的好日子。”
    到今年九月底止，中苏友好协会北京分会已拥有三十二万三千一百九十二名会员。为了进一步加强群众性的中苏友谊活动，中苏友协北京分会曾在各区成立中苏友协干部训练班，第一期学员七百九十八人已经毕业。（新华社）
