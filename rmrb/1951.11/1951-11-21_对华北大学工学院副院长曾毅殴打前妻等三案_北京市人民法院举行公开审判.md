The Beijing People's Court publicly tried three cases on November 17: Zeng Yi, Deputy Dean of the Engineering College of North China University, for assaulting his ex-wife Wang Yizhi; Yang Deqing, Chief of the Third Police Station of the Xijiao Branch of the Beijing Public Security Bureau, for beating and injuring his wife Chen Shuying; and Yu Wen, a cadre in the Personnel Section of the Dongjiao Hygiene Center in Beijing, for illegally detaining female cadres Ma Jingcheng and Wang Lizhi, infringing on human rights. Sentences were pronounced separately.

Wang Feiran, President of the Beijing People's Court, served as the presiding judge, and Pan Shouqian, a prosecutor from the Municipal People's Procuratorate, attended as a representative. Zhang Xiaomei, Chairman of the Municipal Democratic Women's Federation, attended as a juror. Representatives from 81 units, including central and municipal government agencies, people's organizations, democratic parties, factories, and schools, totaling more than 1,300 people, attended as observers.

At the beginning of the public trial, the judges announced the details of the aforementioned three cases.

The first case was Zeng Yi's assault on his ex-wife, Wang Yizhi. Zeng Yi (originally surnamed Jin) married Wang Yizhi twenty-seven years ago and had a daughter, now twenty-one years old. In 1941, the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Higher Court ruled that Zeng Yi and Wang Yizhi should divorce. The family property that the man was entitled to was to be given to the woman, and the daughter was to be raised by the woman. In 1947, Zeng Yi remarried.

In 1948, Wang Yizhi obtained a certificate from the village government (Miaojiaying Village, Lixian County, Hebei Province) and, in the name of the Jin family, retrieved a commercial building located in Gaoyang County from the Gaoyang County government. However, a little over a year later, Zeng Yi helped his mother reclaim the house.

In 1949, Wang Yizhi, accompanied by her daughter who was suffering from lung disease, went to Beijing to find Zeng Yi about the property issue. Zeng Yi found Wang Yizhi a job at the time, but the property issue was not resolved.

On the morning of August 8 this year, Wang Yizhi went to Zeng Yi's dormitory to discuss the property issue again. Zeng Yi argued that this issue could only be resolved through the court and, because he was in a hurry to go to work, choked Wang's neck and pushed her out the door. Wang struggled to get up and was kicked by Zeng. Zeng Yi then ordered worker Wang Huanan to "drag" Wang Yizhi out. Wang Huanan did not carry out his order, and Zeng Yi not only verbally reprimanded him but also hit him.

The second case was Yang Deqing's assault on his wife, Chen Shuying. Yang Deqing and Chen Shuying married on August 20, 1950. After marriage, they often quarreled because they suspected each other of infidelity. Yang Deqing believed that Chen Shuying was his private property: he did not allow her to be economically independent. He had to personally accompany Chen Shuying when she returned to her parents' home and even forbade her from meeting strangers. For these trivial matters, Yang Deqing repeatedly beat Chen Shuying with a belt or his fists. Chen Shuying dared not resist. She said, "Chairman Mao has liberated everyone, why hasn't he liberated me?"

On September 15 (Mid-Autumn Festival) this year, Chen Shuying went to watch a ball game with village cadre Liang Xiuping (female). Yang Deqing constantly suspected that Chen Shuying was talking to someone in private and immediately ordered her to return home. After returning home, Yang scolded Chen Shuying and threatened her with a gun (without a bullet in the chamber). The gun was taken away by guard Zhang Wenshan. Yang then went to the kitchen to find a kitchen knife, but when he couldn't find it, he picked up a bowl of oil and threw it violently at Chen Shuying's head, hitting her in the face. Chen Shuying was sent to the hospital for treatment, and now has scars on her eyelids, nose, and lips.

The third case was Yu Wen et al. infringing on the personal freedom of Ma Jingcheng and Wang Lizhi. Ma Jingcheng (female), a midwife at the Dongjiao Hygiene Center in Beijing, and Wang Lizhi (female), a pharmacist at the center, had contact with Li Huajie (male), a veterinarian at the Chaoyangmen Market Slaughterhouse. Yu Wen, a cadre in the Personnel Section of the Hygiene Center, believed that there was an improper relationship between the three of them. With the consent of Lu Jingdai, the director of the center, Yu Wen presided over the center's September "Life Review Meeting." Li Wendou, the chairman of the center's trade union, attended the "meeting." At the meeting, Yu Wen scolded Ma Jingcheng, saying, "You're shameless, you can't do this again in the future!" Because Ma Jingcheng denied having an improper relationship with Li Huajie, the review meeting yielded no results. The next day, Yu Wen said to Ma Jingcheng in the dormitory, "You are not allowed to associate with Li Huajie anymore, otherwise, the organization will punish you."

On October 4, Yu Wen presided over the center's October "Life Review Meeting." Li Wendou also attended. Yu Wen again raised the issue of Ma and Wang having an improper relationship with Li. Ma Jingcheng stated at the time that this statement was an insult to her, but she was finally forced to admit that going to Erzhacun with Li Huajie was indiscreet. Li Wendou took the opportunity to press her, saying, "Indiscretion means having a relationship between a man and a woman." Because Ma and Wang both denied having an improper relationship with Li Huajie, the meeting continued until 3 a.m. the next morning. After the meeting, Yu Wen continued to force Ma and Wang to admit that they had had sexual intercourse with Li, and claimed that "they would be sent to the hospital for examination." He also said, "I used to be a judicial cadre, you can't deny it." Wang Lizhi had no choice but to ask Yu Wen: "Are you trying to force people to death?" Yu Wen said, "Even death is a dirty death!"

On October 6, Yu Wen went even further and instructed Li Changhui, a cadre at the center, to monitor Ma and Wang, not allowing them to move freely, make phone calls, or meet with anyone. Incoming and outgoing letters also had to be inspected by Yu Wen, and their work was suspended. Yu Wen also revoked Ma Jingcheng's qualifications as a representative of the 10th District Women's Federation. Wang Lizhi had no choice but to write a "confession" according to what Yu Wen et al. had asked for in order to regain her freedom. Wang Lizhi was detained for eight days.

Because Ma Jingcheng firmly denied having an improper relationship with Li Huajie, she was still detained by Yu Wen. Yu Wen also instructed Li Wendou to write a letter in the name of the Dongjiao Hygiene Center to the agency where Ma's boyfriend, Li Chunpu, worked—the Hebei Agricultural College—to inquire whether Li Chunpu had had sexual intercourse with Ma.

When the 10th District Women's Federation went to the center to find out why Ma Jingcheng had not attended the Women's Federation representative meeting, they discovered that Ma had been detained, and they raised objections to the center. Ma Jingcheng was then released, having been detained for a total of nineteen days.

After the judges announced the details of the cases, each party stated their opinions. When the defendant Zeng Yi stated his opinion, he made a review of the two points of assault and property handling, admitted his mistakes, and requested punishment. Next was the speech by the audience. Yun Ziqiang, Dean of the Engineering College of North China University, pointed out Zeng Yi's mistakes in his speech and welcomed him to continue to review his thoughts. Dean Yun Ziqiang said: "Our own government has indeed achieved 'impartiality.' Even though Comrade Zeng Yi is a revolutionary cadre of more than 20 years and has made great contributions to the revolution, once he makes a mistake, the government and the people will still not condone him. We support the public trial by the court. Through this fact, we can greatly increase the people's trust in the government. This fact also powerfully illustrates the noble qualities of the government leaders' 'impartiality.'"

The audience spoke enthusiastically about the above three cases. Applause erupted in the hall from time to time. Twenty-two people spoke in succession. In addition to pointing out the criminal behavior of each defendant and requesting the court to punish them according to law, the vast majority of people analyzed and criticized the ideological roots of the defendants' criminal behavior, and ardently hoped that each defendant would face up to and correct their mistakes, and believed that under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, they would be able to correct their mistakes and be transformed.

In their speeches, the audience generally reviewed their own thoughts and expressed that they would study hard and vigorously promote the Marriage Law in the future, and become models for publicizing the Marriage Law. They warmly hoped that all those who participated in the audience could encourage themselves with this, work together, and truly achieve extensive and in-depth publicity of the Marriage Law. They more unanimously believed that in the era of "the people managing the world," the phenomenon of mistreating women and interfering with freedom of marriage must not be allowed to continue. The entire trial procedure, and the vast majority of speeches, were permeated with the spirit of combining punishment and education.

Finally, Presiding Judge Wang Feiran announced the verdicts for the three cases separately:

(1) Defendant Zeng Yi's behavior of assaulting Wang Yizhi and worker Wang Huanan was exempted from punishment because the circumstances were relatively minor and the review was relatively serious and profound, and he was ordered to make a review in the newspaper.

In addition, regarding the civil dispute between Wang Yizhi and Zeng Yi, the Beijing People's Court sent personnel to Tianjin, Baoding, Gaoyang and other places to conduct on-the-spot investigations of the Jin family's property. After mediation by the Beijing People's Court, the following mediation was established with the consent of both parties:

1. Zeng Yi and Wang Yizhi confirm that they divorced in 1941.
2. The family property that Zeng Yi should have received belongs to Wang Yizhi. Regarding the property that the Jin family actually owns that has now been ascertained, Zeng Yi should receive a total of twelve rooms of real estate at No. 65 and No. 66 on the south side of Dongda Street in Gaoyang County and its adjoining number (currently rented by Wang Wanfu, Zhang Xida, and Ma Qin), which belongs to Wang Yizhi. If other property of the Jin family is found in the future, Wang Yizhi may still request to be divided into Zeng Yi's share.
3. The rent of 1,350 jin of millet (converted into RMB according to the average retail and wholesale price of new and old millet published in the People's Daily on the date of payment) paid by Ma Qin and Wang Wanfu from July to December 1951, and Zhang Xida from April to December, for the aforementioned property. Zeng Yi gave Wang Yizhi one-half (675 jin) on November 19, and the remaining part will be paid off in January 1952.
4. The land and houses that Zeng Yi should have been divided in Miaojiaying Village, Lixian County, all belong to Wang Yizhi.
5. The daughter, Peirui, will be jointly responsible for raising her by both parties based on the actual economic situation.
6. Zeng Yi is responsible for sending his daughter Peirui to the hospital for recuperation, and the recuperation will continue until the hospital allows her to be discharged based on the current economic situation. The recuperation expenses are entirely borne by Zeng Yi.

(2) Defendant Yang Deqing disregarded the principle of equality between men and women stipulated by the Marriage Law, and committed the serious crime of discriminating against and abusing his wife Chen Shuying to the point of causing injury. He is sentenced to three years of imprisonment.

(3) Defendant Yu Wen illegally detained Ma Jingcheng and Wang Lizhi, and unilaterally revoked Ma Jingcheng's qualification as a representative of the 10th District Women's Federation of Beijing, infringing on personal freedom and political rights. He is sentenced to six months of imprisonment.

Defendant Li Wendou participated in Yu Wen's illegal activities and should make a review in the newspaper.

Defendant Lu Jingdai, as the director of the institute, condoned the illegal activities of Yu Wen and others, and is given a reprimand.

The public trial court adjourned at 7 p.m. on the 17th.

    对华北大学工学院副院长曾毅殴打前妻等三案
    北京市人民法院举行公开审判
  北京市人民法院于十一月十七日公开审判华北大学工学院副院长曾毅殴打前妻王益智，北京市公安局西郊分局第三派出所所长杨德庆殴伤其妻陈淑英，北京市东郊卫生所人事科干事郁文非法拘禁女干部马静承、王立志等侵犯人权案三件，并分别宣判。
  审判庭由北京市人民法院院长兼审判长王斐然主审，市人民检察署由检察员潘守谦代表出席，市民主妇女联合会主席张晓梅出席陪审。参加旁听的有中央和市级机关、人民团体、民主党派、工厂、学校等计八十一个单位的代表共一千三百余人。
    公审大会开始，审判员分别宣布上述三案案情。
    第一案是曾毅殴打前妻王益智案。曾毅（原姓晋）与王益智于二十七年前结婚，生一女，现年二十一岁。一九四一年，经晋冀鲁豫边区高等法院判决，曾毅与王益智离婚，男方应得的家庭财产归女方所有，所生女孩由女方抚养。一九四七年，曾毅另行结婚。
    一九四八年，王益智由老家（河北蠡县缪家营）村政府取得证明信，以晋家名义由高阳县政府领回座落在该县的工商业用房一所。但一年多后，曾毅帮助他的母亲又把房子要了回去。
    一九四九年，王益智为房产问题同正患肺病的女儿到北京找曾毅。曾毅当时曾给王益智找到了工作，但房产问题并未得到解决。
    今年八月八日晨，王益智又到曾毅宿舍谈财产问题。曾毅以此一问题非经法院不能解决，又因急于上班办公，竟用手掐住王的脖子，并将王推倒于门外。王起而挣扎，又被曾踢了一脚。曾毅又命工友王化南把王益智“拉出去”。王化南没有执行他的命令，曾毅不仅口头斥责他，并且动手打了他一下。
    第二案是杨德庆打伤妻子陈淑英案。杨德庆与陈淑英于一九五○年八月二十日结婚。婚后，两人互相怀疑对方不忠实，经常吵架。杨德庆认为陈淑英就是他自己的私产：经济上不让她独立自主。陈淑英回娘家他要亲自伴送，甚至不准她同生人见面。为些生活琐事，杨德庆用皮带或用拳头几次殴打陈淑英。陈淑英不敢反抗。她说：“毛主席把谁都解放了，怎么就没解放我？”
    今年九月十五日（中秋节），陈淑英与村干部梁秀屏（女）去看赛球，杨德庆始终怀疑陈淑英与别人去谈私情，立刻就要陈回家。到家后，杨即斥骂陈淑英，并拔出手枪相威胁（未顶上子弹）。枪被警士张文山夺走。杨又到厨房找菜刀，没找到，就拿起油碗猛向陈淑英的头部掷去，正砍中陈的面部。陈淑英经送入医院医治，现在眼皮、鼻梁、嘴唇等部均留有伤疤。
    第三案是郁文等侵犯马静承、王立志的人身自由案。北京市东郊卫生所助产士马静承（女）和该所司药员王立志（女）与朝阳门市场屠宰场兽医李华杰（男）相互交往。该卫生所人事科干事郁文认为他们三人之间有不正当的关系。经该所所长鲁景岱的同意，由郁文主持召开了该所九月份的“生活检讨会”。该所工会主席李文斗参加了“会议”。会上，郁文辱骂马静承说：“真不要脸，以后再这样搞不行！”由于马静承否认与李华杰有不正当的关系，检讨会没有结果。次日，郁文在宿舍里对马静承说：“以后不准再与李华杰来往，不然，组织上一定要处罚你。”
    十月四日，在郁文主持下又召开了该所十月份的“生活检讨会”。李文斗也参加了。郁文在会上又提出马、王与李有不正当的关系。马静承当时表示这种说法是对她的侮辱，但终于被迫承认与李华杰到二闸村去玩是失于检点。李文斗乘机进逼说：“失于检点就是有男女关系。”这次会议因马、王二人均否认与李华杰有不正当的关系，延续开到次日晨三时。会后，郁文继续逼迫马、王承认与李发生过性行为，并声称“要送医院检查”。还说：“我当过司法干部，不承认不成。”王立志无奈，乃询问郁文：“你要逼死人吗？”郁文即说：“死也是脏死的！”
    十月六日，郁文变本加厉，竟指使该所干部李昌惠监视马、王二人，不准她们自由行动，不准打电话，也不准接见任何人，来往信件也都得经过郁文检查，并且停止了她两人的工作。马静承的第十区妇女联合会代表的资格也被郁文撤销。王立志在无可奈何之下，就按照郁文等追问的意思写了“坦白书”，才得恢复自由。王立志被拘禁了八日。
    马静承因坚决否认与李华杰有不正当的关系仍被郁文拘禁。郁文又指使李文斗用东郊卫生所的名义给马的男友李春浦所服务的机关——河北农学院去信，询问李春浦是否与马发生过性行为。
    第十区妇女联合会到该所了解马静承未出席妇联代表会议的原因时，才发现马被拘禁，乃对该所提出意见，马静承才得恢复自由，共被拘禁十九日。
    当审判员宣布案情后，即由各当事人陈述意见。在被告曾毅陈述意见时，就打人及财产处理两点进行了检讨，承认错误，并请求处分。接着是旁听人发言。华北大学工学院院长恽子强在发言中指出了曾毅的错误，并欢迎他继续从思想上进行检讨。恽子强院长说：“我们自己的政府的确作到了‘大公无私’。尽管曾毅同志是二十多年的革命干部，尽管他对革命有过很大的贡献，但一旦犯了错误，政府和人民仍然对他是毫不姑息的。我们拥护法院的公开审判，通过这个事实，可以大大地提高人民对政府的信任，这个事实也有力地说明了政府的领导者‘大公无私’的高贵品质。”
    旁听者对上述三案均踊跃发言。会场掌声时起。先后发言的有二十二人。他们除指出各个被告的犯罪行为并要求法院依法惩处外，绝大多数的人对被告犯罪行为的思想根源进行了分析与批评，热烈地希望各被告正视与改正自己的错误，并相信在共产党及人民政府正确的领导下，他们一定能够改正错误，得到改造。
    旁听人在发言中，一般都联系自己的思想进行了检讨，表示在今后要好好学习与努力宣传婚姻法，成为宣传婚姻法的模范。他们热情地希望所有参加旁听的人都能以此自勉，一致努力，真正做到广泛地深入地宣传婚姻法。他们更一致认为：在“人民管天下”的时代，绝不容许虐待妇女、干涉婚姻自由的现象继续存在。整个审判程序，与绝大多数发言中，都贯串着惩罚与教育相结合的精神。
    审判长王斐然最后分别对三案宣示判决：
    （一）被告曾毅殴打王益智及工友王化南的行为，因情节较轻、检讨比较认真、深刻，免予处刑，登报检讨。
    又，关于王益智与曾毅之间的民事纠纷，经北京市人民法院派员赴天津、保定、高阳等地对晋家财产加以实地调查，并经北京市人民法院调解，业经双方同意成立了如下的调解：
    一、曾毅、王益智确认于一九四一年离婚。
    二、曾毅应得的家庭财产归王益智所有。就现已查明晋家实有的财产，曾毅应得高阳县城东大街路南六十五号六十六号及其连号（现由王万福、张希达、马勤三家租用）的房产共计十二间，归王益智所有。以后再查出晋家其他财产，王益智仍可请求分得曾毅应得之一份。
  三、前项房产自一九五一年马勤与王万福所交七月份到十二月份房租九百一十八斤小米，张希达由四月份到十二月份四百三十二斤小米，共计一千三百五十斤小米（按给付日人民日报所载新旧伏地小米零售批发平均价折付人民币）。曾毅于十一月十九日交给王益智二分之一（六百七十五斤），其余部分于一九五二年一月份交清。
    四、在蠡县缪家营村曾毅应分得的土地及房屋统归王益智所有。
    五、所生女孩培瑞由双方根据实际经济情况，共同负责抚养。
    六、由曾毅负责将女儿培瑞送医院疗养，就目前经济情况疗养到医院许可出院时为止。疗养费用完全由曾毅负担。
    （二）被告杨德庆漠视婚姻法规定的男女平等的原则，歧视、虐待竟至伤害其妻陈淑英的严重罪行，处徒刑三年。
    （三）被告郁文非法拘禁马静承、王立志，擅自撤销马静承北京市第十区妇女联合会代表的资格，侵犯人身自由及政治权利，处徒刑六个月。
    被告李文斗参与郁文的非法行为，应登报进行检讨。
    被告鲁景岱身为所长，纵容郁文等的非法行为，予以训诫。
    公开审判庭于十七日下午七时闭庭。
