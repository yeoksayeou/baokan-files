Central Technical Administration
Self-Criticism for Not Valuing Worker Yang Xiuzhi's Invention

To the Editor:

On August 15th, the People's Daily published Jiang Ping's criticism of our Bureau for not valuing the automatic binding machine invented by Yang Xiuzhi, a worker at the Printing Factory of the Political Department of the North China Military Region. This criticism is correct. We now make the following self-criticism:

(1) At the time, we believed that the printing industry in Beijing was currently using manual binding. If a binding machine that performed individual actions could be achieved, it would be a step forward. We planned to further research continuous automatic machines after this type of machine was completed. This idea was a technologically conservative viewpoint, and it hindered Yang Xiuzhi's research enthusiasm.

(2) We felt that researching a continuous automatic binding machine with a complex mechanism, without readily available reference materials, starting from manual binding, would be a difficult task, consuming a lot of manpower and resources, and taking a long time. We stood purely on an economic viewpoint, thinking we could slow down a bit, and did not actively support Yang Xiuzhi's invention.

(3) Because we are currently receiving many requests for assistance in research and experimentation of inventions, we submit all inventions that cannot immediately have a significant impact on production to the Invention Review Committee for decision. However, the invention of an automatic binding machine is urgently needed for our country's cultural construction; but we failed to weigh the importance, quickly handle and support it, and instead wanted to submit it to the soon-to-be-established Invention Review Committee. This is perfunctory and irresponsible, and in fact, a bureaucratic style.

Based on the above, our understanding of the State Council's "Decision on Rewarding Inventions, Technical Improvements, and Rationalization Proposals Related to Production" and the People's Daily's editorial "Earnestly Reward Creation and Invention in Production and Construction" was not profound enough. After this criticism and self-criticism, we will certainly work hard to overcome these negative tendencies in our future work and improve our work to a higher level.

### 中央技术管理局  对工人杨秀芝的发明不重视的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中央技术管理局
    对工人杨秀芝的发明不重视的检讨
    编辑同志：八月十五日人民日报发表了江萍对我局不重视华北军区政治部印刷厂工人杨秀芝发明自动装订机的批评，这个批评是正确的。我们现检讨如下：
    （一）当时我们认为：北京印刷业现在所用的是手工装订，若能达到单独动作的装订机器，已经进了一步。等到这种机器完成后，再进一步研究连续自动机器。这种想法是技术上的保守观点，更妨碍了杨秀芝的研究情绪。
        （二）我们觉得要研究一种机构复杂的连续自动装订机，如果没有现成的参考资料，由手工装订，是一件烦难的工作，必将耗费很多的人力物力及长久的时间。我们就站在纯经济观点上，认为可以稍缓一步，对杨秀芝的发明，没有予以积极的支持。
    （三）由于目前向我局请求协助研究实验的发明创造很多，所以凡对生产上不能立即发生重大作用的，我们均提交发明审查委员会来决定。但自动装订机的发明，是我国文化建设中所迫切需要的；而我们却不能权衡轻重，迅速予以处理与支持，也要提交将待成立的发明审查委员会。这是敷衍塞责，实际上是官僚主义的作风。
    根据以上所说，我们对政务院颁布的“关于奖励有关生产的发明，技术改进及合理化建议的决定”以及人民日报的“切实奖励生产建设中的创造和发明”的社论的认识，是不够深刻的。经过这次的批评与检讨，我们在今后工作当中，一定认真克服这些不良的倾向，把工作提高一步。
                                           中央技术管理局
