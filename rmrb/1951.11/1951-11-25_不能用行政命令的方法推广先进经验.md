　　Advanced Experience Cannot Be Promoted by Administrative Order

　　When the state-owned Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory promoted the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, it implemented the erroneous policy of "promote first, then educate"; therefore, the factory's promotion work failed. The so-called "promote first, then educate" essentially cancels propaganda and education, and uses a simple administrative command method to promote advanced experience, that is, not letting the masses know why they are doing this thing, but letting the masses do this thing in confusion. The result will inevitably be failure, which is very natural.

　　To promote advanced experience, it is necessary to criticize the old and backward experience, which means to carry out a revolution in working methods. Any advanced experience will inevitably encounter resistance from the conservative thinking of the masses and cadres at the beginning of its promotion. Therefore, before and during the promotion of advanced experience, it is necessary to conduct full propaganda and education among the masses, repeatedly explaining why it is necessary to learn from advanced experience, what are the benefits of learning advanced experience, what are the disadvantages of not learning, and it is necessary to combine it with the original working methods in the factory to conduct specific analysis and comparison, and truly open up the thinking of the masses. Otherwise, when the masses do not understand these issues, they will not be able to learn actively and consciously. The leading cadres of the state-owned Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory should imagine: If the higher authorities want you to change the current leadership method and implement a new leadership method, when you do not understand what the benefits of the new leadership method are, and do not understand what the disadvantages of the old leadership method are, will you consciously learn and implement the new leadership method? If you cannot do it yourself, how can the workers do it?

　　The lesson of the state-owned Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory's erroneous promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method should attract the attention of the leading cadres of factories and mines in various places. In order to do a good job in promoting advanced experience, we must first conduct full ideological education among the masses to make them act consciously and willingly.

### 不能用行政命令的方法推广先进经验

    不能用行政命令的方法推广先进经验
    国营天津第一棉纺织厂推广郝建秀工作法时，实行了错误的“先推广后教育”的方针；因此，该厂的推广工作失败了。所谓“先推广后教育”，实质上是取消宣传教育，而以简单的行政命令的办法，推广先进经验，也就是说，不让群众知道为什么要作这件事情，就让群众胡胡涂涂地去作这件事情。其结果必然失败，是非常自然的。
    推广先进经验，必然要批判旧的落后的经验，这就是说，要在工作方法上实行革命。任何一个先进经验，在开始推广时，必然遇到来自群众中以及干部中的保守思想的抗拒。因此，在推广先进经验之前，以及推广的过程之中，必须向群众进行充分的宣传教育，反复说明为什么要学习先进经验，学会了先进经验有什么好处，不学有什么坏处，并须结合厂内原有的工作法，进行具体地分析比较，真正打通群众的思想。否则，当着群众还不了解这些问题的时候，他们就不可能主动地自觉地进行学习。国营天津第一棉纺织厂的领导干部应该设想一下：假如上级要你们改变目前的领导方法，而实行一种新的领导方法，在你们既不了解新的领导方法有什么好处，又不了解旧的领导方法有什么坏处的时候，你们是否会自觉地学习并实行新的领导方法呢？如果自己尚且不能，工人怎么能够这样呢？
    国营天津第一棉纺织厂这种错误的推广郝建秀工作法的教训，应该引起各地厂矿企业领导干部的注意。为了把推广先进经验的工作作好，必须首先对群众进行充分的思想教育，使群众自觉自愿地行动起来。
