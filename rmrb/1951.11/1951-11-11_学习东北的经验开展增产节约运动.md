    Chairman Mao instructed us at the Third Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: To continue to strengthen the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, increase production, and practice strict economy is the central task of the Chinese people today. In order to launch a nationwide movement to increase production and practice economy, the Northeast's experience is particularly worthy of our attention and introduction. This year, the Northeast's increase in production and economy in the economic sphere alone can reach 10.04 million tons of grain. This is a large number, equivalent to five times the Northeast's total industrial investment in 1949, or twice the Northeast's total industrial investment in 1950. Calculating at a grain price of 630,000 yuan per ton, it is worth 6,555.2 billion yuan.

    Many people do not understand the great significance of increasing production and practicing economy. They regard increasing production and practicing economy as simply a task of increasing material wealth. They say: Agriculture and mining can increase production; for industry to increase production, the first thing to solve is the problem of raw materials and sales. Some people also regard increasing production and practicing economy as simply a financial task, believing that as long as warehouses are cleared and stagnant equipment is disposed of, production has increased. Some even regard increasing production and practicing economy as requiring workers to work overtime, live frugally, and lower their living standards. These views are all one-sided and incorrect. The great significance of increasing production and practicing economy lies not only in accumulating huge wealth for the country, so that the country can use the money saved for economic construction and national defense construction; at the same time, it is also necessary to use the movement to increase production and practice economy to improve the operation and management of our enterprises. We see that the Northeast's method of increasing production and practicing economy by ten million tons is achieved by accelerating the turnover of working capital, reducing costs, over-accumulating, increasing equipment utilization, improving operating methods, reducing waste products, and improving quality. Among them, accelerating the turnover of working capital accounts for the largest proportion of the funds saved. Secondly, increasing equipment utilization, improving operating methods, etc. are also important. This can be done in all business sectors. We should not regard increasing production as simply increasing the country's wealth, but should regard it as a comprehensive movement to improve production. For example, in the cotton textile industry, increasing spindles or increasing the number of shifts is certainly increasing production; similarly, increasing production efficiency, strengthening technical management, cost management, and financial management to reduce costs and improve quality is also increasing production. Increasing production in enterprises is inseparable from improving management. To increase production and practice economy, it is necessary to implement an economic accounting system in operation and management. In this way, we will not regard increasing production and practicing economy as simply a financial task or a purely financial point of view. Similarly, we will not regard increasing production and practicing economy as simply a political task to support the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, but recognize that this is a long-term direction that New China must strive for in order to achieve industrialization.

    Vice Premier Chen Yun instructed us to "recognize that the main symbol of serving the people is to save funds for the country and increase wealth as rationally as possible. Before the arrival of the period of national large-scale construction, we must achieve results and gain experience in this area." This instruction is very correct. The movement to increase production and practice economy is not only a simple movement to increase production and practice economy, but also a movement to learn how to operate and manage rationally and implement an economic accounting system. Every state-owned enterprise cadre should learn from the experience of the advanced working class in the Northeast in increasing production and practicing economy this year, and strive to launch a nationwide movement to increase production and practice economy.

学习东北的经验开展增产节约运动
    毛主席在人民政协全国委员会第三次会议上指示我们：继续加强抗美援朝工作，增加生产，厉行节约，是中国人民今天中心的任务。为了展开全国范围的节约增产运动，东北的经验是特别值得我们重视与介绍的。东北今年单在经济方面增产节约的价值，即可达一千零四十万吨粮食。这是一个很大的数目，它相当于一九四九年东北全部工业投资的五倍，或一九五○年东北全部工业投资额的两倍。以每吨粮价六十三万元计算，就值六万五千五百二十亿元。
    有许多人不了解增产节约的重大意义，他们把增产节约看成单纯的增加物质财富的工作。他们说：农业与矿业可以增产；工业增产则首先要解决原料和销路问题。也有人把增产节约看成单纯的财政任务，认为只要清理仓库，处理呆滞器材，就是增产了。甚至有人把增产节约视为要工人加班加点，省吃俭用，降低生活水准。这种看法都是片面的不正确的。增产节约的伟大意义，不仅在为国家积累巨大的财富，使国家能把省下的钱用在经济建设和国防建设上；同时还要通过增产节约运动使我们企业的经营管理工作提高一步。我们看东北方面一千万吨增产节约的办法是以加速流动资金周转，降低成本，超额积累，提高设备运用率，改善操作方法，减少废品，提高质量等等方法得到的。其中特别是以加速流动资金周转的方法，所节约的资金所占比例为最大。其次提高设备运用率，改善操作方法等等也是重要的。这是在一切企业部门都可以做的。我们不要把增产看成单纯的增加国家财富，而应该把它看成一个全面改善生产的运动。例如在棉纺织业中，增加纱锭或增加开工班次固然是增产；同样，如果把生产效率提高，加强技术管理、成本管理和财务管理，使成本降低和质量提高也是增产。企业中的增产与改善经营是分不开的，要增产节约就必须要求在经营管理上实行经济核算制，这样我们就不会把增产节约看成单纯的财政任务，或单纯的财政观点。同样我们也不会把增产节约看成单单为了支援抗美援朝运动的政治任务，而认识到这是新中国要实行工业化所必须努力的长期性的方向。
    陈云副总理指示我们要“认识到为人民服务的主要标志，是尽可能地合理地为国家节约资金，增加财富。在国家大建设时期到来以前，在这一方面我们必须做出成绩，取得经验”。这一指示是非常正确的，增产节约运动不仅是一个单纯的增产节约运动，而同时又是一个学会经营管理合理化，实行经济核算制的运动。每一个国营企业干部应当学习东北先进工人阶级今年增产节约的经验，为展开全国规模的增产节约运动而奋斗。
