    Correct Supply System Ideology, Closely Rely on the Masses
    Zhengzhou Railway Administration Clears Out Large Quantities of Backlogged Materials
    Wan Jing
    The Phenomenon of Material Backlog is Very Serious
    The Zhengzhou Railway Administration, in the process of asset inventory, discovered that the phenomenon of excessive occupation of working capital (especially materials) was very serious. According to preliminary statistics, the total value of materials stored in the administration's production and enterprise departments was 6.9 times the designated quantity. In individual units (such as the Chang'an Engineering Section), the material inventory at the end of June was 59 times the designated quantity; that is to say, one section occupied the materials of 59 similar sections. The administration's subordinate bureaus all had excessive material backlogs. For example, the Xi'an Bureau had a backlog of more than ten times the designated quantity; the Hankou Bureau had a backlog of more than seven times; and the Zhengzhou Bureau had a backlog of more than thirteen times. The obsolete and scrap materials of the administration's subordinate units accounted for 24% of the commonly used materials; off-book materials were worth more than 19.5 billion yuan; and the losses caused by the reduced effectiveness of materials due to prolonged storage and becoming waste products totaled 5.8 billion yuan.

    During the coal inventory, the administration discovered a shortage of 2,800 tons; while from January to July 1951, the administration issued more than 400 million yuan in coal-saving bonuses, equivalent to more than 2,000 tons of coal.

    The production of some units under the administration was unplanned. For example, the brake shoes produced by the Jiang'an Factory were enough for three years' use. A certain bridge factory and a certain locomotive depot's foundry also had similar situations.

    Supply System Ideology Creates Many "Black Jobs"
    The supply system ideology and departmentalism of some cadres are the main reasons for the above situation. For example, the Jiang'an Locomotive Depot only uses more than twenty large and small smoke tubes per month, but its inventory reaches more than one thousand. The following situation often occurs: the responsible department does not investigate the stored materials, the on-site cadres do not report, one issues as needed, and the other receives as needed, thinking that "they will always be needed in the future." Many units write off as much material as they receive, and never return materials, because this "can save a lot of trouble." As a result, the Sanqiao Factory has 539 pairs of wheels and axles that are not on the books; the Zhengzhou Electrical Section has 154 automatic telephones and 40 magneto telephones that are not on the books. Because the accounts and materials do not match, and the leading cadres do not have a clear picture, it provides a lot of convenience for grassroots units to do "black jobs." For example, the Jiang'an Workers' Club, the Jiang'an Bridge Factory's workshop, and a certain engineering section's houses were all built without asking for money from the higher authorities. The organizers also thought this was called "having a solution."

    Gradually Changed the Practice of Not Calculating Detailed Accounts
    When the inventory work began, some employees did not understand, thinking that "it is inconvenient to use tools after they are handed over," "it will be difficult to get materials and accessories again after they are handed over to the public, what should I do if I encounter rework?" Some cadres verbally agreed with economic accounting, but when accurately calculating their working capital, they felt it was "troublesome" and said: "I am not corrupt, why bother calculating detailed accounts!" "Let's see how it goes!" "It's really getting tighter and tighter!" Leading cadres repeatedly explained the significance of verifying working capital to employees with this kind of thinking; through the bureau's newspaper, telephone conferences, widespread publicity and education were carried out. At the same time, 290 working capital verification personnel were trained, and working groups were formed to supervise and guide the work on-site, mobilizing the masses to study and discuss the working capital verification work, and calling on employees to "not miss a single rail spike, not lose a piece of scrap iron, and not waste a drop of oil." After most employees' understanding improved, they actively participated in the inventory work. Li Zhensheng, the head of the Jiang'an Engineering Section, said: "In the past, we used waste materials to do black jobs, heaven knows, in the future, I will suggest that the branch bureau chief order that black jobs are not allowed to be done again." In the past, when the engineering departments received tasks, they immediately asked for money and materials. Now, special personnel have been dispatched to study how to allocate and utilize the stored materials of various engineering sections; the Wenxiang Engineering Area voluntarily requested to adjust the past stored materials; when workers receive materials, they also ask about the price and calculate the cost. Now, when receiving circular steel plates, they calculate the diameter and cut them accordingly, unlike in the past when they would cut off a large piece and take it away. The phenomenon of blind production in Jiang'an Factory and other units has begun to be corrected. The workers' "small warehouses" in Jiang'an Locomotive Depot have also been opened.

### 纠正供给制思想，紧紧依靠群众  郑州铁路管理局清出大批积压材料

    纠正供给制思想，紧紧依靠群众
    郑州铁路管理局清出大批积压材料
    万晶
    材料积压现象十分严重
    郑州铁路管理局在清理资产过程中，发现占用过多流动资金（尤其是材料）的现象十分严重。据初步统计，该管理局的生产及企业部门，存料总值为定量的六点九倍。个别单位（如长安工务段）六月底的存料，为定量的五十九倍；这就是说，一个段占用了同样的五十九个段的材料。该管理局所属各分局都积压了过多的材料。如西安分局积压了十倍以上的材料；汉口分局积压了七倍以上的材料；郑州分局积压了十三倍以上的材料。该管理局所属单位的呆废料，占常用料百分之二十四；账外材料共值一百九十五亿多元；因为材料放置时间太久，效能减低，变成废品，造成的损失共五十八亿元。
    该管理局在清查燃煤时，发现亏短了二千八百吨；而在一九五一年一月至七月，该局却发出了节省煤的奖金四亿多元，折合煤二千多吨。
    该管理局所属若干单位的生产，是没有计划的。如江岸工厂生产的制动瓦，已够三年之用。某桥梁厂及某机务段的翻砂厂，也有此种情况。
    供给制思想造成许多“黑活”
    某些干部的供给制思想与本位主义观点，是造成上述情况的主要原因。如江岸机务段每月只用大小烟管二十余根，而库存达一千多根。常常发生这种情况：对于存料，主管部门不调查，现场干部不反映，一个照发，一个照领，认为“将来总是用得着的”。许多单位领多少料就报销多少，从不退料，因为这样“可以省去许多麻烦”。结果，像三桥工厂有五百三十九对车轮及车轴没有上账；郑州电务段有一百五十四部自动电话机和四十部磁石电话机没有上账。由于账料不符，领导干部又心中无数，就给基层单位做“黑活”以很多便利。如江岸工人俱乐部、江岸桥梁厂厂房，某工务段房屋，都没有向上级要钱，就盖起来了。主办人还认为这叫“有办法”。
    逐渐改变了不算细账的作风
    清查工作开始时，有的职工思想不通，认为“工具交出了，使用不方便”，“材料配件一交公，再领就难了，一遇返工活，怎么办？”有的干部口头赞成经济核算，但当精确计算他的流动资金时，就嫌“麻烦”，就说：“我又不贪污，何必细算帐！”“走着看，看着走！”“真是越来越紧了！”领导干部向有这种思想的职工，反复说明核定流动资金的意义；通过局报，电话会议，广泛进行宣传教育，同时训练了二百九十个核定资金人员，组成工作组，到现场督促指导，发动群众学习与讨论核定资金工作，号召职工“不漏掉一个道钉，不丢掉一块碎铁，不浪费一滴油。”大部职工认识提高以后，即积极参加清查工作。江岸工务段长李振声说：“过去用废料做黑活，天知道，今后要建议分局长下令，不准再做黑活。”过去工务部门接到任务，立刻要钱要料，现在派了专人研究如何调配利用各工务段存料；阌乡工区自动要求调整过去的存料；工人们领料时，也问问价钱，算算成本。现在领圆形钢板，算好直径，照样剪下，不像过去剪下一大块就拿走。江岸工厂等单位盲目生产的现象已开始纠正。江岸机务段工人的“小仓库”也都打开了。
