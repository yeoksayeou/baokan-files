　　 Blood debt must be paid in blood!
    After Reading the Article "Accuse the American Murderers!"
    Comrade Editor: After reading the Korean News "Accuse the American Murderers!" and then looking closely at those ten shocking photos, I cannot help but feel deep hatred for the imperialist murderers. We must sternly warn these Wall Street murderers: the people of the world will never allow you to commit such inhumane crimes, the kind that only cannibals would do, under the guise of establishing "peace and independence," "freedom and justice" in Korea.
    Blood debt must be paid in blood! The Korean people will never forgive these murderers, and the Chinese people and the people of the world will not allow these beasts to continue their bloody deeds on the beautiful land of Korea. We must resolutely strike at them and punish them!
    In order to end this disaster for our fraternal Korean people as soon as possible, and to prevent our own people's happy lives from being threatened, we must respond to Chairman Mao's call and support the Chinese People's Volunteers with increased production and thrift, and defeat the American aggressors.　Li Ping

　　 血债要用血来还！
    “控告美国杀人犯！”一文读后
    编辑同志：我读完了朝鲜通讯“控告美国杀人犯！”后，再细看那十幅触目惊心的照片，使我不能不对帝国主义杀人犯感到切齿的痛恨。我们要严厉地警告这些华尔街的凶手们：全世界的人民决不允许你们借着所谓在朝鲜建立“和平与独立”、“自由和正义”的名义，而干吃人生番才干得出的惨无人道的罪行。
    血债要用血来还！朝鲜人民是决不会宽恕这批杀人犯的，中国人民及全世界人民也不会允许这批野兽再在美丽的朝鲜土地上干着血腥的勾当，我们一定要坚决地打击他们，惩办他们！
    为了使兄弟的朝鲜人民早日结束这种灾难，为了使我们祖国人民的美好生活不受威胁，我们一定要响应毛主席的号召，用增产节约的行动来支持中国人民志愿军，打败美国侵略者。　力萍
