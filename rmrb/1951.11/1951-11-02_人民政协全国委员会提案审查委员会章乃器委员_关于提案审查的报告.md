The Standing Committee designated seventeen members to form the Proposal Examination Committee. Now, I report to the assembly on the process and results of the proposal review.

This meeting eliminated the co-signature system for proposals, resulting in a larger number of proposals compared to the previous meeting, totaling one hundred and fifteen. Classified by nature, they include: eight on increasing production and practicing economy, opposing corruption and waste; three on the united front; one on military affairs; eleven on industry and mining; five on transportation and railways; eleven on agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and water conservancy; two on finance and trade; three on labor; three on general economy; sixteen on education and training; four on medicine and hygiene; seven on science and literature; three on publishing and news; four on population and immigration; five on women and marriage law; ten on old revolutionary base areas; six on ethnic minorities; five on overseas Chinese; one on religion; one on relief; and six others.

The proposal review work, in accordance with the instructions of the Standing Committee, adopted a serious and responsible attitude that fully respects the opinions of the proposers. For many proposals, materials were first obtained from the relevant central authorities as a basis for review, and some proposals were also studied and discussed with the proposers before the review opinions were made after repeated discussions at the review meeting.

For proposals that need to be submitted to the government for handling, the review opinions are divided into two categories: suggesting that the Central People's Government examine and handle them, and suggesting that the Central People's Government pay attention to them. For proposals that need to be handled by the Standing Committee or sent to relevant agencies or organizations for handling, the review opinions are also made according to this classification. In addition, individual proposals are handled in a special way.

Any proposal whose content, in whole or in part, is a matter that the government should handle, whether the government is already handling it, or is likely to begin handling it or preparing to handle it in the near future, is suggested to be examined and handled by the Central People's Government. There are eighty-seven proposals of this type.

Any proposal whose content is worth noting, but is currently difficult to handle, or whose reasons and methods need further study, is suggested that the Central People's Government pay attention to it. There are fifteen proposals of this type.

For proposals that need to be handled by the Standing Committee or sent to relevant agencies or organizations for handling, the review opinions are also made according to the above standards. Five proposals are to be submitted to the Standing Committee for examination and handling, and one is to be noted; three proposals are to be sent to relevant agencies or organizations for examination and handling, and three are to be noted.

Proposal No. 80, with the approval of the Standing Committee, has been changed to a temporary motion and submitted to the assembly.

In addition: Three letters of opinion have been received at this meeting, and have been sent to relevant agencies for research according to their content and nature.

Due to our limited knowledge and insufficient experience, coupled with the urgency of time, the review work will have shortcomings. I hope that all members and comrades will check the proposal review opinions. If there are different opinions, even if they are not raised at the assembly, they can still be submitted in writing to the Standing Committee for further consideration after the meeting.

All review opinions have been printed and distributed separately, and please review and approve them together with this report at the assembly.

　  关于提案审查的报告
    常务委员会指定提案审查委员十七人，组成提案审查委员会。现在向大会报告提案审查的经过和结果。
    本次会议取消了提案的连署制，提案较之上次会议为多，一共收到一一五件。按其性质分类，计：增产节约、反对贪污浪费八件；统一战线三件；军事一件；工矿十一件；交通、铁道五件；农林、畜牧、水利十一件；金融、贸易二件；劳动三件；一般经济三件；教育、训练十六件；医药卫生四件；科学、文艺七件；出版、新闻三件；人口、移民四件；妇女、婚姻法五件；老根据地十件；民族六件；华侨五件；宗教一件；救济一件；其他六件。
    提案审查工作依照常务委员会的指示，采取认真负责、充分尊重提案人意见的态度。许多提案先向中央主管部门取得材料以为审查的根据，有些提案还和提案人研究、商量，再经过审查会议的反复讨论，才作出审查意见。
    提案须送政府处理者，审查意见分为建议中央人民政府核办、建议中央人民政府予以注意二类。提案须由常务委员会处理或送请有关机关、团体处理者，审查意见亦以此分类。此外，还有个别提案另作特殊处理的。
    凡提案内容全部或一部为政府应该办理的事务，不论政府已在办理，或在最近期间可能着手办理或着手准备，均建议中央人民政府核办。此类提案共八十七件。
    凡提案内容值得注意，但目前尚难办理，或提案的理由、办法尚待进一步研究者，均建议中央人民政府予以注意。此类提案共十五件。
    凡提案须由常务委员会处理或送请有关机关、团体处理者，审查意见亦依上述标准作成。计交常务委员会核办者五件，予以注意者一件；送请有关机关、团体核办者三件，予以注意者三件。
    提案第八十号，经常务委员会决议，改作临时动议，向大会提出。
    又：本次会议收到意见书三件，已按其内容、性质，分别送请有关机关予以研究。
    由于我们知识有限，经验不够，加以时间匆促，审查工作是会有缺点的。希望各位委员、各位同志对于提案审查意见加以检查。如有不同意见，即使不及在大会提出，会后仍可以书面提交常务委员会再作考虑。
    全部审查意见已经另行印发，请大会连同本报告予以审查核定。
    中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议提案审查委员会
              一九五一年十一月一日
