    The Responsible Spirit of Railway Police Officer Zhu Kewen Touched Passengers
    At 2:00 PM on October 15th, when passenger train 188 and mixed train 255 were meeting at Zhao Yi Station on the South Tongpu Railway, railway police officer Comrade Zhu Kewen picked up a passenger's luggage on the second platform and immediately announced it to the passengers for claiming. No one claimed it at the time. Just as he was about to put up another notice, a passenger, Xue Fuquan (from Zhuoli Village, Sanqu District, Linjin, doing business in Xi'an), and his wife rushed to the stationmaster to look for their luggage, looking flustered. Comrade Zhu Kewen immediately returned the original item to them in person. Passenger Xue Fuquan took out a wad of money from his pocket to give to the police officers, but they politely declined. This made the passenger couple even more moved, and they praised them repeatedly.

    铁路警察朱克温的负责精神感动了旅客
    十月十五日下午二时一八八客车与二五五次混合列车在南同蒲路赵伊站会车时，铁路警察朱克温同志从第二站台上拾得旅客行李一件，当即向旅客通告招领。当时无人认领。将要再出布告招领时，一旅客薛福泉（临晋三区卓里村人，在西安经商）与他的妻子面色仓惶地跑来找站长，找行李。朱克温同志立即将原物当面还给他们。旅客薛福泉从身上拿出一把钱想送给驻警们，但被他们婉言谢绝。这越发使这对旅客夫妇感动得连声赞扬。
