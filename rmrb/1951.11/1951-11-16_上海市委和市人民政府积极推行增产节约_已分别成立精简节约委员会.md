The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided that all Communist Party members and cadres in the city should study the relevant documents of the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, in order to ideologically guarantee the development of the campaign for increased production and thrift. The city's Party reporters will go to grassroots units within days to give reports on increased production and thrift. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has also formulated specific measures regarding streamlining the personnel of government organs, saving financial expenditures, streamlining meetings, saving water and electricity, and using cars and houses. Without hindering existing work, various government organs will transfer a large number of cadres to grassroots units to help and strengthen grassroots work, and change the phenomenon of some government organs being bloated.
	The Shanghai Municipal People's Government recently held its tenth enlarged administrative meeting. Vice Mayor Pan Hannian gave a report at the meeting on launching the streamlining and thrift campaign. The meeting decided to establish the "Shanghai Municipal People's Government Streamlining and Thrift Committee," nominating Pan Hannian as chairman and Sheng Pihua and Xu Dixin as vice-chairmen.
