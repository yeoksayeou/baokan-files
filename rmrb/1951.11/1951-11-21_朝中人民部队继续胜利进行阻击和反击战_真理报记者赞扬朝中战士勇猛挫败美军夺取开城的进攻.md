Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 20th. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army continue to achieve victories in defensive and counter-attack battles. One battalion each of the American invading army and the Lee Seung-man puppet army attacked our positions along the line from Height 635.8 north of Mundung-ri to Naeri on the 14th. After more than seven hours of fierce fighting, a unit of our army drove the enemy back, killing or wounding more than 240 of them. On the 13th, 15 enemy tanks and more than 40 enemy soldiers sneaked into the Hadochon area northeast of Yonchon and were repelled by our heavy artillery fire, with six of their tanks destroyed. On the night of the 13th, a unit of our army counter-attacked the enemy in Songchon-dong, west of Chorwon. In an hour and a half of fighting, the entire 2nd company of the 21st Regiment of the Thai mercenary troops in the area was wiped out.

Xinhua News Agency, 20th. TASS Moscow, 19th: Pravda recently published a commentary from its reporter Dekasenko in Pyongyang regarding the war situation on the Kaesong front. Dekasenko said that a few days ago, in several places on the western front in Korea, especially in some places south and west of Kaesong, there were fiercer battles than before. The US military command, after replenishing the divisions that had been greatly reduced in strength after the failure of the autumn offensive, threw a large number of troops into battle, attempting to seize Kaesong at all costs. In order to seize Kaesong, the US military command tried every means to delay the negotiations at Panmunjom, hoping to take Kaesong by military force in the meantime.

Dekasenko pointed out that since November 9th, the US Eighth Army troops, under the orders of Van Fleet, have launched five or six fierce attacks every day on the positions of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army south and west of Kaesong.

Dekasenko pointed out that the defensive battle south of Kaesong was fierce, and praised the courage and tenacity shown by the soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. In this area, the interventionist army actually felt the power of the firepower of the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. American Lieutenant Sabor, who was captured south of Kaesong on November 12, said that the intensity of the Korean howitzer and mortar fire on November 11 was the fiercest I have ever seen in Korea in a year.

Dekasenko pointed out that, according to captured American officers, the commander of the Eighth Army, Van Fleet, personally directed the operation to seize Kaesong. It is worth noting that neither Ridgway nor Van Fleet has publicized the recent offensive operations in several places, especially southwest of Kaesong. On the contrary, these two warriors, who were defeated in both the summer and autumn offensives, remained silent about the fierce fighting in Korea. Van Fleet's headquarters communique said that no significant battles had occurred on any front.

It is not difficult to guess that the US military command is acting on orders from Washington. While the Sixth General Assembly of the United Nations is in session, and while representatives of the World Peace Council, representing the will of millions of ordinary people, are demanding an end to the criminal intervention in Korea, it is obviously disadvantageous for the American rulers to flaunt their adventures in Korea at this time. They know that these adventures will cause a new wave of anger among the people of the United States, Britain, Turkey, Canada, and France. Because their sons are losing their lives in distant Korea for the benefit of the American monopoly capitalists.

Dekasenko said that the battles south of Kaesong and in other areas of the front have not brought victory to the interventionist army. The soldiers of the People's Army and the Volunteer Army defeated the enemy's attacks and demonstrated extraordinary heroism. They launched courageous attacks behind enemy lines, causing great losses to the enemy's manpower and equipment. The heroic soldiers are stubbornly defending their front lines and are determined to frustrate the desperate adventures of the US military command.

    朝中人民部队继续胜利进行阻击和反击战
    真理报记者赞扬朝中战士勇猛挫败美军夺取开城的进攻
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十日电】朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军继续在阻击战和反击战中获得胜利。美国侵略军及李承晚伪军各一个营，十四日向我文登里以北六三五·八高地至内里一线阵地攻击。我军某部与敌激战七个多小时，将这股敌军逐退，并杀伤其二百四十多名。十三日，敌军战车十五辆及步兵四十多名，窜至涟川东北下斗村地区，被我猛烈炮火击退，并击毁其战车六辆。我军某部十三日夜反击铁原以西宋村洞敌军，战斗一个半小时，即将该地泰国帮凶军第二十一团第二连全部歼灭。
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十九日电：真理报顷刊载该报记者德卡诚科自平壤发来关于开城前线战事的评述。德卡诚科说，几天前，在朝鲜西部前线若干地方，特别是开城南面和西面一些地方，爆发了比以前更加猛烈的激战。美军司令部补充了秋季攻势失败后大大减员的师团，就把大量部队投入战斗，企图不顾一切代价地一举攻至开城城下。为了夺取开城，美军司令部千方百计企图拖延板门店的谈判，想在这个当儿凭借军事力量占领开城。
    德卡诚科指出，自十一月九日以来，美国第八军部队奉范佛里特的命令，每天都对开城以南与以西的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的阵地发动五六次的猛烈进攻。
    德卡诚科指出开城南面的防御战是激烈的，并赞扬朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军战士所表现的勇敢和顽强的精神。在这一地区，干涉军实际感受到了人民军和中国人民志愿军火力的威力。十一月十二日在开城南面被俘的美国中尉萨波尔说，在十一月十一日，朝鲜榴弹炮和迫击炮火力的猛烈，我在朝鲜一年间从未看到过。
    德卡诚科指出，据被俘的美国军官说，第八军军长范佛里特亲自负责指挥夺取开城的作战。值得指出的事实是：不论是李奇微或范佛里特，对于近来在若干地方，特别是在开城西南发动的攻势作战，都没有进行宣传。相反地，这两个在夏季攻势和秋季攻势中都遭到失败的武士却对朝鲜境内的激烈战斗保持缄默。范佛里特司令部的公报说，各线都未发生任何重要的战事。
    不难猜到，美军司令部是奉华盛顿的命令行事的。当联合国第六届大会正在开会的时候，在世界和平理事会代表千百万普通人民的意志要求停止对朝鲜的罪恶干涉的时候，对美国统治者来说，这时炫耀他们在朝鲜的冒险显然是不利的。他们知道，这些冒险会在美国、英国、土耳其、加拿大和法国的老百姓中引起新的愤怒的浪潮。因为，他们的儿子正在遥远的朝鲜为了美国垄断资本家集团的利益而送掉性命。
    德卡诚科说，开城南面以及前线其他地区的战斗没有给干涉军带来胜利。人民军与志愿军的战士击败敌人的进攻，表现了非常的英雄主义。他们在敌人战线后方发动勇猛的攻击，使敌人的有生力量和装备蒙受巨大损失。英雄的战士们正在顽强地保卫着他们的战线，并且决心挫败美军司令部的绝望冒险。
