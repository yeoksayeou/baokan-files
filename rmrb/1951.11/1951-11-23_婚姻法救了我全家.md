    The Marriage Law Saved My Entire Family
    Zeng Maopu
    When my wife, Li Shiying, and I reconciled and returned from the court to my long-dilapidated home, hand-in-hand with our four children of varying heights, I felt both sorrow and joy. Sorrow for having personally destroyed a happy family; joy that the People's Government had educated me, pulling me back from the path of destruction and degradation, enabling me to start anew and live happily with my wife and children.
    I am a merchant in Chongqing who deals in general merchandise. My wife and I married in 1944, and our relationship was very good after the marriage. But not long after, I developed an inappropriate affection for another woman, living a life of extravagance and debauchery outside the home. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, merchants who wanted their businesses to flourish and their capital to circulate smoothly had to understand social interaction; and social interaction was nothing more than eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling. So, imperceptibly, I came to regard this corrupt and decadent lifestyle as "a matter of course."
    Once a person embarks on an evil path, their heart also becomes hardened. For several years, I had completely abandoned my responsibilities as a husband and father, never caring about the lives of my wife, Li Shiying, and my children. Although I spent money recklessly outside, I didn't bring a single penny home. Li Shiying repeatedly pleaded with me in tears, hoping I would turn back, but I responded with beatings and scolding. Soon after, my general merchandise store went bankrupt due to my mismanagement and excessive losses. But I continued to carouse outside and formally announced my marriage to a prostitute named Hu Ciping, disregarding the lives of my wife and children at home.
    After liberation, I continued to live my decadent life. I disliked that Li Shiying was old and not beautiful, and I felt that the four children were a great burden. So I often thought of getting rid of them. As a result, my attitude towards Li Shiying became even worse. After the promulgation of the Marriage Law last year, I tried to exploit loopholes and filed for divorce from Li Shiying. The comrades in the Chongqing People's Court accepted my divorce case and earnestly criticized and educated me, pointing out that Li Shiying and I had originally married freely and that I should not attempt to abandon her after she had borne several children; I should not shirk my responsibility to raise my own children. The court comrades pointed out that the Marriage Law stipulates that husband and wife have the obligation to love and respect each other, help each other, support each other, live in harmony and unity, engage in labor and production, raise children, and strive together for family happiness and the construction of a new society. At the same time, they analyzed how my past corrupt and decadent life was due to my having contracted the bad habits of the old society. In the new society, I should thoroughly transform myself. After listening to the words of the comrades in the Chongqing People's Court, I felt distressed, thinking about Li Shiying's deep affection for me and about the innocent and lively four children. On the day of the trial, the children came to the court with their mother. The judge said to me, "Zeng Maopu, look at these children beside you, they are all your own flesh and blood!" I looked up at them, all dressed in tattered clothes, their faces pale from long-term malnutrition. The children's rolling eyes stared straight at me, and my eyes were immediately moistened with tears of shame and unease. My heart was filled with thousands of thoughts, and I couldn't speak. The more I thought about it, the more I felt sorry for my wife and children. I realized my mistake for the first time, and I was also troubled by my conscience for the first time. Therefore, when the judge asked me again, I said that I would no longer seek a divorce. I am willing to reconcile with my wife, Li Shiying. At the same time, I am willing to use my earnings to subsidize Hu Ciping's living expenses after I separate from her.
    Although our life is very hard now, we are happy in spirit! I especially want to thank my wife, who has forgiven me and tirelessly works with me to overcome difficulties and raise our children. I deeply repent for my past mistakes! In the future, I can only intensify my study, intensify production, and work hard to transform myself, in order to repay the People's Government for my education and my wife for her forgiveness.

    婚姻法救了我全家
    曾懋普
    当我和我的妻子李时英重归于好，共同牵着高矮不齐的四个孩子，从法院回到我那个破落已久的家的时候，我难过，我也快乐。难过的是我亲手摧毁了一个快乐的家庭；快乐的是人民政府教育了我，把我从毁灭和堕落的路上拉了回来，使我重新作人，重新和我的妻子、我的孩子们快乐地生活在一起。
    我是一个在重庆经营百货业的商人。我和我的妻子是在一九四四年结婚的，婚后感情很好。但是没过好久，我就不正当地爱上了别的女人，在外边过着花天酒地的生活。在国民党反动派统治时期，商场中的人，要想生意兴隆，周转灵活，必须懂得交际应酬；而交际应酬又不外乎是吃、喝、嫖、赌这一套。所以无形中我便把这种腐化、堕落的生活，看作“理所当然”。
    人一走上邪路，心也变得狠了起来。几年来，我一直卸下了当丈夫和当父亲的责任，从不过问我的妻子李时英和孩子们的生活，尽管我在外面胡乱花钱，却不把一个钱拿回家去。李时英曾几次哭着劝我，希望我回头，但我反以打骂对待她。不久，因我不料理百货店，百货店亏空太多而倒闭了。可是我仍然在外鬼混，并和妓女胡次萍正式宣布结婚，不管家中妻子和孩子们的死活。
    解放后，我照样过着灯红酒绿的日子，我嫌李时英年纪大了，人不漂亮，并觉得四个孩子是我的大累赘，于是我常常想把他们甩掉。因此对李时英的态度也更坏了。去年婚姻法颁布后，我想钻空子，就提出要和李时英离婚。重庆市人民法院受理了我的离婚案件，法院工作同志认真地对我进行批评和教育，指出我和李时英原是自由结婚的，不应该在妻子生了几个孩子以后企图遗弃她；不应该逃避对亲生子女的养育责任。法院工作同志指出：婚姻法规定：夫妻有互爱互敬、互相帮助、互相扶养、和睦团结、劳动生产、抚育子女、为家庭幸福和新社会建设而共同奋斗的义务；同时，还分析了我过去那种腐化堕落的生活，是由于我沾染了旧社会的恶习气所致。在新社会里，应该彻底改造自己。我听了重庆市人民法院工作同志的话以后，心里难受起来，想到李时英对我的深厚感情，想起天真活泼的四个孩子。在审判那天，孩子们随着他们的母亲到法庭来了。审判员对我说：“曾懋普，你看你身边的这些孩子，全是你的亲生儿女呀！”我抬头看看他们，他们都穿得破破烂烂的，脸上也因长期营养不良而没有血色，孩子们骨碌碌的眼睛直盯着我，我的眼睛顿时被惭愧和不安的泪水润湿了，心里千头万绪的，说不出话来。我越想越觉得对不起妻子，对不起孩子们。我第一次认识到我的错误，也第一次受到良心的责备。因此，当审判员再问我时，我就表示不再要求离婚了，我愿意和我的妻子李时英重归于好，同时，我愿以劳动所得，补助胡次萍和我脱离同居生活后的生活费用。
    目前我们的生活虽然很苦，但我们精神上是快乐的！我尤其要感谢我的妻子，她宽恕了我，不辞劳苦地和我共同克服困难，养育孩子。我深深地忏悔着我过去的错误！今后我只有加紧学习、加紧生产、努力自我改造，以答谢人民政府对我的教育以及妻子对我的宽恕。（新华社）
