    Soviet Experts Help Fushun Electrical Machinery Plant
    Successfully Promote High-Speed Cutting Method
    Soviet experts helped the Fushun Electrical Machinery Plant's machine shop successfully promote the high-speed cutting method on old-style lathes. The machine efficiency brought about by this success is estimated to be equivalent to adding two machine shops with the same equipment and five hundred technical workers to the plant.
    Because the equipment in the Fushun Electrical Machinery Plant's machine shop was relatively old, the shop encountered obstacles from the conservative thinking of many workers when it began to promote this advanced experience. Although the plant had convened employee representative meetings and Communist Party member representative meetings to repeatedly conduct education, and had established a promotion team to organize workers and technicians to visit Shenyang, everyone still lacked confidence. Even the workers who returned from visiting Shenyang believed that what they saw were Soviet lathes and dared not believe that the high-speed cutting method could be promoted on old-style belt-driven lathes.
    On August 24th of this year, a Soviet expert came to the factory. He decided to personally conduct an experiment. At that time, he was operating an old Japanese-style lathe. He skillfully and smoothly tested three lathes in one go without any problems. The fourteen-foot belt-driven lathe, which previously could only rotate thirty revolutions per minute, rotated to one hundred and thirty revolutions per minute under his hands, without any noise. The Soviet expert stayed at the plant for a week, going to the site every day to solve various technical difficulties in promoting the high-speed cutting method. He not only directed repair and installation work, but also personally operated the machines. With the patient guidance of the Soviet expert, the high-speed cutting method was first promoted in the machine shop. This increased the production efficiency of the machine shop by more than double. For example, the Zhang Yuanzeng model team in the workshop had a production increase plan for the second half of the year of fourteen tons and three hundred and twenty-five catties worth of grain, but after the implementation of the high-speed cutting method, by the end of September, it had completed 163% of the original plan three months ahead of schedule.
    Currently, the plant has applied the high-speed cutting method to shapers and vertical lathes. Because the potential of the machines has been greatly exploited, the problem that the plant's casting capacity was greater than its machining capacity, which had not been solved for a long time, has also been solved.

### 苏联专家帮助抚顺机电厂  推行高速切削法成功

    苏联专家帮助抚顺机电厂
    推行高速切削法成功
    苏联专家帮助抚顺机电厂机械车间在旧式车床上推行高速切削法成功。由于这一成功所发挥出来的机器效能，据估计约等于在该厂增加了两个同样设备的机械车间和五百名技术工人。
    因为抚顺机电厂机械车间的设备比较陈旧，该车间在开始推行这一先进经验时，曾经遇到许多工人的保守思想的障碍。虽然厂内曾召开过职工代表会和共产党员代表会，反复进行教育，并成立了推广小组，组织工人和技术人员到沈阳参观，但大家还是没有信心。连到沈阳参观回来的工人也认为他们看到的都是苏联车床，不敢相信高速切削法能在旧式皮带车床上推行。
    今年八月二十四日，苏联专家来到了工厂。他决定亲自试验一次。当时他所操纵的是老旧的日本式的车床。他运用自如地一口气试验了三台车床，一点没有出岔子。过去每分钟只能转三十转的十四尺皮带车床，在他的手下却转到一百三十转了，床子上没有一点杂音。苏联专家在该厂留了一星期，每天到现场解决推广高速切削法时技术上的各种困难。他不但指挥修理、安装等工作，还亲自动手操作。经过苏联专家的耐心指导，高速切削法首先在机械车间推广开来了。这样就使机械车间的生产效率提高一倍以上。如该车间的张远增模范小组，今年下半年的增产计划是十四吨零三百二十五斤粮食的价值，但推行高速切削法后，到九月底止，已提前三个月完成原计划百分之一百六十三。
    目前，该厂已把高速切削法运用到牛头刨床和大立旋床等方面。由于机器潜在能力的大大发挥，该厂长期没有解决的铸造能力大于机械加工能力的问题，从此也得到了解决。    （新华社）
