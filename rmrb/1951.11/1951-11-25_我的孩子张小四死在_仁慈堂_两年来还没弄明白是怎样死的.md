    My Child, Zhang Xiaosi, Died at "Ren Ci Tang"
    Still Haven't Figured Out How He Died After Two Years
    My child, Zhang Xiaosi, died at the Xishiku "Ren Ci Tang" [Charity Hall] in Beijing more than two years ago. I still don't know how he died.
    Because of family difficulties, I sent my two children, Zhang Xiaoer and Zhang Xiaosi, to the Xishiku "Ren Ci Tang" in Beijing in March 1949. At that time, I was studying at North China University. In August of the same year, after I graduated, I went to see my children. A French nun surnamed Ge and a woman named Chen Jingfen said that the child had been dead for more than two months. I was very sad. I asked several times how he died, but I couldn't get the truth. At that time, because my eldest child, Zhang Xiaoer, was still at "Ren Ci Tang," I was afraid it would be bad for the child, so I didn't investigate further. In October 1950, I wanted to take my eldest child back, but I was not allowed, so I became even more suspicious. It wasn't until March of this year, after repeated negotiations, that I was able to take Zhang Xiaoer out. However, I still can't figure out how Zhang Xiaosi died. I ask the People's Government to help me and get to the bottom of this. Yang Yuhua

    我的孩子张小四死在“仁慈堂”
    两年来还没弄明白是怎样死的
    我的孩子张小四，在北京西什库“仁慈堂”死去已经两年多了。他究竟是怎样死的，我到现在还不知道。
    我因家境困难，于一九四九年三月，把两个孩子张小二和张小四送入北京西什库“仁慈堂”。那时我在华北大学学习。同年八月，我毕业后去看孩子，一法籍葛姓修女和一个叫陈景芬的说，孩子死去两月多了。我非常难过。究竟怎样死的，我问了几次都得不到真相。当时因为我的大孩子张小二还在“仁慈堂”，恐怕对孩子不利，也就没有深究。一九五○年十月，我想领回大孩子，没有被允许，因此我更是怀疑。直到今年三月，经再三交涉，才把张小二领了出来。但是，张小四究竟怎样死的，还是弄不明白。我要求人民政府替我作主，弄个水落石出。杨育化
