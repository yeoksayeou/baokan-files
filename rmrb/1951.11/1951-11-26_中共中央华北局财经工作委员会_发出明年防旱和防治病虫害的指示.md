    CCP Central Committee North China Bureau Financial and Economic Work Committee
    Issues Instructions on Drought Prevention and Pest Control for Next Year
    The Financial and Economic Work Committee of the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau issued two work instructions on strengthening drought prevention and pest control in 1952 on the 4th and 5th of this month, calling on all localities to lead farmers in making all preparations this winter to ensure agricultural production next year.
    The drought prevention instructions point out that: There are very few paddy fields in North China, and the rainfall is insufficient and uneven, so most areas are often subject to spring drought. However, on the other hand, the drought prevention conditions and the potential capacity of existing water conservancy facilities in North China have not been fully utilized. Now, all localities should immediately start the following drought prevention work: 1. Lead farmers to universally autumn plow before the ground freezes, so that the cultivated land can accumulate snow, store water, and nourish moisture (the moist soil under the topsoil is called moisture). Call on cotton farmers to pull out cotton stalks and plow the land early. This year, areas with disasters and poor harvests should help farmers solve the difficulties of labor and animal power, and ensure a universal autumn plowing. 2. For wheat fields and cultivated land that can be irrigated, mobilize farmers to universally winter irrigate. 3. Advocate raising ridges on cultivated land to accumulate snow; mobilize farmers in areas along rivers and lakes to store water and ice, and use it to irrigate the land after thawing next spring. 4. Mobilize farmers to cooperate with each other and build reservoirs year by year in a planned manner.
    The instructions require all localities to adopt different drought prevention measures according to different conditions: First, strengthen the management of existing channels and wells, so as to use water rationally and expand the irrigated area. Except for a few large channels and a few wells that are well managed, the existing channels and wells in North China generally have not fully played their due role due to poor management. If the existing channels and wells in the entire region are well managed, they can irrigate one-quarter to one-third more land than at present. All localities should correct the tendency to attach importance to water conservancy projects and neglect management, correct farmers' parochialism in water use, improve existing water conservancy management institutions or establish institutions, and vigorously help farmers strengthen democratic management of channels or wells. Second, actively and as far as possible develop water sources, universally mobilize farmers to help each other dig wells and open springs, and manufacture a large number of waterwheels to help farmers solve the difficulties of water lifting tools. Old water lifting tools should also be manufactured in large quantities and improved to make up for the shortage of waterwheels. Areas along rivers should mobilize farmers to build small channels and dig more wells that penetrate the river, and may focus on developing machine irrigation. Third, areas lacking water sources must start from improving and utilizing natural conditions, improving and improving cultivation techniques, and planting more drought-resistant crops to prevent drought, and promote a series of drought-resistant methods such as autumn plowing, spring harrowing, seizing moisture to plant, borrowing moisture to plant, and more hoeing. In excessively dry areas, deep-rooted drought-resistant crops such as wheat and potatoes should be planted, and a large number of short-term crop seeds should be stored for drought prevention. The instructions require all localities to make preparations for drought prevention this winter, such as training cadres, training technical personnel, preparing materials, and rectifying the management institutions of water channels and wells. All localities should also formulate specific drought prevention methods and plans as soon as possible, print drought prevention manuals, conduct extensive drought prevention education to farmers in winter schools, and launch a mass drought prevention campaign.
    Regarding pest control, the instructions call on all localities to follow the spirit of "preventing drought every year and preventing insects at all times" to achieve early prevention, early treatment, and root cure, and reduce the losses caused by pests and diseases as much as possible. The instructions require all localities: 1. For insect pests such as locusts, cotton aphids, red spiders, and mole crickets that have been controlled with certainty, ensure that even if they occur, they will not spread into disasters; 2. For pests and diseases such as borers, cutworms, white hair disease, and black smut that cannot be completely eliminated at present, the degree of harm should be reduced year by year, and efforts should be made to prevent them from becoming disasters within three to five years; 3. For wireworms, cotton red blight, wheat stem black powder disease, etc., which currently have few prevention and control methods, their harm should also be reduced as much as possible, and all localities are required to create effective prevention and control methods next year.
    In order to achieve the above goals, the instructions point out: All localities should do the following: 1. Universally and conscientiously mobilize farmers to select seeds, winter plow, pick up grain stubble and burn it, seal the grain straw with mud, uproot weeds and burn them, and eliminate the parasitic places of pests. Next spring, farmers should be mobilized to dig out insect eggs, mix seeds, and remove insects. 2. List pest control as one of the tasks of carrying out the agricultural bumper harvest campaign, formulate prevention and control plans at each level, convene symposiums on pest control, mobilize farmers to formulate prevention and control plans, and include them in patriotic covenants. 3. Locust-affected areas and cotton-producing areas must establish and improve prevention and control institutions, and reconnaissance of insect pests should be done well before the end of April next year. 4. Train primary technical cadres for pest control, county and district cadres should generally learn prevention and control techniques, and conduct a large number of rotational training for young students and labor models. Develop rural technical committees and technical groups as grassroots organizations for pest control, summarize and promote farmers' experience in pest control, and identify local methods and medicines for pest control. 5. All localities should adhere to the principle of mainly using human power to eliminate pests and diseases, and oppose the tendency to rely solely on drugs and machinery; develop and rectify mutual aid organizations to enrich the manpower for eliminating pests and diseases. 6. Cotton-growing areas should plant local tobacco leaves equivalent to one percent of the cotton fields as pesticides for eliminating cotton aphids. All provinces should start preparing insecticidal drugs and machinery such as cotton oil soap, local tobacco leaves, and sprayers this winter, and must be prepared before the end of April next year.

    中共中央华北局财经工作委员会
    发出明年防旱和防治病虫害的指示
    中共中央华北局财经工作委员会，本月四日、五日先后发出关于加强一九五二年防旱和防治病虫灾害的两个工作指示，号召各地在今冬领导农民做好一切准备工作，保证明年的农业生产。
    防旱指示指出：华北水田很少，雨水不够又不调匀，大部地区常遭春旱。但是，另一方面华北区防旱条件和现有水利设备的潜在能力，还没有完全发挥出来。现在，各地应该立即着手进行以下几项防旱工作：一、领导农民在地冻以前普遍秋耕，使耕地能积雪蓄水养墒（表土下的湿土名墒）。号召棉农早拔棉棵耕地。今年有灾歉收的地区要帮助农民解决劳力和畜力的困难，保证普遍秋耕一遍。二、能浇灌的麦田和耕地，发动农民普遍冬浇。三、提倡在耕地上起垅积雪；发动沿河沿湖地区农民储水养冰，待明春解冻后用来浇地。四、发动农民互助合作，有计划地逐年增修蓄水池。
    指示要求各地根据不同的条件采取不同的防旱措施：第一，加强对现有渠道和水井的管理工作，作到合理用水，扩大灌溉面积。华北现有的渠道和水井，除少数大渠和少数水井管理较好以外，一般都因管理不善，没有充分发挥应有的作用。如果全区现有渠道水井管理得好，就可比现在多浇四分之一到三分之一的地。各地应该纠正重视修水利工程轻视管理的偏向，纠正农民用水的本位主义思想，健全现有水利管理机构或建立机构，并大力帮助农民加强对渠道或水井的民主管理。第二，积极地尽可能地开发水源，普遍发动农民互助打井、开泉，并大量制造水车，帮助农民解决汲水工具的困难。旧的汲水工具，也该大量制造并加以改良，以补水车不足。沿河地区应发动农民兴办小型渠道和多打透河井，并可有重点地举办机器灌溉事业。第三，水源缺乏的地区，须从改善和利用自然条件、改进和提高耕作技术、多种耐旱作物等方面着手防旱，提倡秋耕、春耙、趁墒抢种、借墒点种、多锄等一系列的抗旱办法。过于干旱的地区应多种小麦、马铃薯等深根耐旱作物，并应储备大量短期作物种籽防旱。指示要求各地在今年冬天做好防旱的准备工作，如训练干部、训练技术人员、准备物料、整顿水渠水井的管理机构等工作。各地还应该及早订出防旱的具体办法和计划，印制防旱手册，在冬学中向农民广泛地进行防旱教育，发动群众性的防旱运动。
    关于防治病虫害，指示号召各地本“年年防旱，时时防虫”的精神，做到早防、早治和根治，尽可能地减少病虫灾害的损失。指示要求各地：一、对已有防治把握的蝗虫、棉蚜、火蜘蛛、蝼蛄等虫害，保证即使发生也不致蔓延成灾；二、对目前不能完全消灭的钻心虫、切根虫、白发病、黑穗病等病虫害，要逐年减轻其危害的程度，争取在三五年内使其不再成灾；三、对目前还很少防治办法的金针虫、棉花红旱、小麦秆黑粉病等，也要尽量减轻其危害，要求各地在明年创造出有效的防治办法来。
    为了实现上述目标，指示指出：各地应做好以下几项工作：一、普遍认真地发动农民选种，冬耕，拾谷茬烧掉，把谷草用泥封起来，连根拔除杂草烧掉，铲除害虫的寄生场所。明春应发动农民挖掘虫卵、拌种和除虫。二、把防治病虫害列为开展农业丰产运动的工作之一，逐级订出防治计划，普遍召开防治病虫害的座谈会，发动农民订防治计划，并列入爱国公约。三、蝗虫危害区和棉产区，必须把防治机构建立并健全起来，明年四月底前应把侦察虫害的工作做好。四、培养防治病虫害的初级技术干部，县、区干部要普遍学会防治技术，并大量轮训青年学生和劳动模范。发展农村技术委员会和技术小组，作为防治病虫害的基层组织，总结和推广农民防治病虫害的经验，并鉴定防治病虫害的土法土药。五、各地应掌握以人力除治病虫害为主的原则，反对单纯依赖药械的偏向；发展和整顿互助组织，充裕除治病虫害的人力。六、种棉地区应种植相当于棉田百分之一的土烟叶，作为除治棉蚜的药剂。各省应在今年冬天开始准备棉油皂、土烟叶、喷雾器等除虫的药械，必须在明年四月底以前备妥。（新华社）
