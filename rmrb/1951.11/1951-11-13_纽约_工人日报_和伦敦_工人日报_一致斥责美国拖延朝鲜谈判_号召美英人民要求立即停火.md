Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 12th. The New York "Daily Worker" published an editorial on November 5th condemning the latest obstructive actions by the United States in the armistice negotiations, saying: "The actions of the Pentagon (referring to the U.S. military) negotiators are an ugly and criminal violation of the interests of the American people." The editorial pointed out that the Chinese and Korean sides had put forward new proposals regarding the issue of the military demarcation line, taking into account the opinions of both sides, in order to ensure the smooth progress of the negotiations, but the U.S. side did not take any action to seek a solution. The military leaders in Korea clearly have no intention of ending the war as long as they can keep it going.

The editorial pointed out that there is no reason to continue the Korean War, and the U.S. obstruction of the negotiations is purely for the narrow interests of private interest groups. The editorial denounced the warmongers who fear peace, saying: "Of course, some people are willing to continue the war in order to 'prevent' the huge benefits of the annual $62 billion arms contracts from being 'lost'. Some people believe that peace in Korea will inevitably expand, making it more difficult to rearm German Nazis, Tito's fascists, and Japanese war criminals, and they are willing to continue the war."

The editorial called on the American people to demand an immediate ceasefire, a rapid solution to the Korean issue, and the return of American soldiers home by Christmas.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 12th. The London "Daily Worker" on November 10th criticized the United States for continuing to adopt a delaying policy in the Korean armistice negotiations, saying: "The American generals are still refusing to agree to a ceasefire. They want to resolve every issue in their favor before they stop the slaughter."

The newspaper pointed out: "The lives of British soldiers are very precious and must not be left to the American generals, who are war maniacs, to control. From the actions of the United States in the Korean ceasefire negotiations, it is already very obvious that the Americans tend to disregard the lives and deaths of the British, and even The Times has to demand a change of policy. The Times demands that the United Nations order an immediate ceasefire in Korea."

The newspaper finally called out: "The British people should urge Parliament and the government to tell the Americans that if they do not immediately agree to a ceasefire, all British troops will withdraw from Korea. If the United Nations does not take the same action, then it admits that it is a tool of the United States."

　　纽约“工人日报”和伦敦“工人日报”
    一致斥责美国拖延朝鲜谈判
    号召美英人民要求立即停火
    【新华社布拉格十二日电】十一月五日的纽约“工人日报”发表社论斥责美国最近在停战谈判中新的阻挠行动说：“五角大楼（指美国军方）谈判代表的行动，是违反美国人民利益的丑行与罪行。”社论指出：中朝方面为使谈判得以顺利进行已提出了关于军事分界线问题的照顾到双方意见的新建议，而美国方面却丝毫没有一点谋取解决的行动。在朝鲜的军事领袖们只要能够让战争继续下去的话，他们显然无意让战争结束。
    社论指出：让朝鲜战争继续下去是没有丝毫理由的，美方阻挠谈判纯粹是出于私利集团的狭隘利益。社论痛斥害怕和平的战争贩子们说：“当然，有人为了‘防止’每年六百二十亿美元的军火合同的巨大利益‘受到损失’，他愿意使战争继续下去。有人认为朝鲜的和平必不可免地将扩展开来，因而使重新武装德国纳粹、铁托法西斯分子以及日本战犯们更为困难，他愿意使战争继续下去。”
    社论号召美国人民要求立即停火，迅速解决朝鲜问题，以及让美国士兵们能在圣诞节前回国。
    【新华社布拉格十二日电】伦敦“工人日报”十一月十日抨击美国在朝鲜停战谈判中继续采取拖延政策说：“美国的将军们仍然拒绝同意停火。他们要使每一个问题的解决都于他们有利，然后才肯停止屠杀。”
    该报指出：“英国士兵的生命非常宝贵，绝不能听任战争狂的美国将军们去支配。从美国在朝鲜的停火谈判的行动中已经非常明显地看出美国人不顾英国人死活的倾向，甚至泰晤士报也不得不要求改变政策。泰晤士报要求联合国下令立刻在朝鲜停火。”
    该报最后号召说：“英国人民应该力促议会与政府告诉美国人说，假若不立即协议停火，所有英国军队就要从朝鲜撤退。假若联合国不采取同样的行动，那它就自己承认是美国的工具了。”
