    Explanatory Notes Should Be Printed When Screening Translated Films with Deeper Content
   To the Editor: In the past two years, the Chinese film industry has translated many Soviet films, which have been screened across the country in rotation to educate the masses, and have achieved good results. However, due to the fact that the translated language is not always easy to understand, and due to shortcomings in projection technology or projectors, audiences are still confused after watching and listening, and even produce adverse effects. For example, during the National Day celebration, the Hailar City Cinema screened the film "The Third Blow." Some viewers could not distinguish between the Soviet army and the German invaders, and as a result, they applauded indiscriminately, affecting order in the theater. Also, on October 4th, during the screening of the film "Conspiracy" at the same cinema, most of the audience did not know which country the story was about. Some said it was Spain, some said it was Iran, and others said it was the United States. The result was a mess, and the understanding of the content was affected.
   I suggest that theaters in various places should print explanatory notes for translated films with deeper content in the future. Or, one or two days before the film is screened, post them on advertising boards in places with more pedestrians for everyone to view. In this way, audiences can have a preliminary understanding of the film's content before watching it, and their understanding of the content will be deeper after the film is screened, and the propaganda and educational effect will be greater.

      Editor's note: Printing explanatory notes is one of the ways to strengthen the propaganda and educational effect of films. The China Film Distribution and Exhibition Corporation has always compiled and printed explanatory notes for Soviet translated films for distribution to theaters in various regions, but some cinemas have not printed and distributed them. The company will hold a managers' meeting this month to discuss and resolve this issue.

    放映内容较深的翻译影片时应印发说明书
   编辑同志：近二年来，我国电影界翻译了很多苏联影片，在全国各地轮回上映，用来教育广大群众，已收到好的效果。但是，由于翻译语言还不易完全听懂，和放映技术或放映机有缺点等关系，使观众看了听了还是糊涂，甚至产生不良的效果。例如：在国庆节，海拉尔市电影院上映的“第三次打击”一片，有的观众分不出哪是苏军，哪是德寇，结果就乱鼓起掌来，影响了场内秩序。又如十月四日，在同院上映的“阴谋”影片，观众们大部分都不知道是哪国的事，有的说是西班牙的，有的说是伊朗的，又有的说是美国的。结果闹得一塌糊涂，对内容的体会就受影响了。
   我建议各地影院，今后遇有内容较深的翻译片，应印制说明书。或者在影片放映前一两天，贴到行人较多地方的广告板上，供大家观览。这样，能使观众们在看影片前对影片内容有个初步认识，影片放映后，对内容的体会也就会深刻些，所收到的宣传教育效果也就更大了。

      编者按：印发说明书是加强影片的宣传教育作用的方法之一。中国影片经理公司一向编印苏联翻译片说明书，供各地区影院发行，但有些电影院并未印发。该公司将在本月召开经理会议，讨论并解决这个问题。
