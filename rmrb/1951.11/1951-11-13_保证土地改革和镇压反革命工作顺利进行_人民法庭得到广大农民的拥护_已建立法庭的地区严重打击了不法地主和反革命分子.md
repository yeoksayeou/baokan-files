　　[This News Report] To ensure the smooth progress of land reform and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the broad masses of peasants in areas undergoing land reform universally demand the swift establishment of People's Courts.
    In rural areas that implemented land reform last winter and this spring, counter-revolutionary elements and unlawful landlords used various despicable and vicious methods, such as armed attacks, spreading rumors to incite the masses, concealing property, slaughtering livestock, as well as arson and poisoning, to stubbornly obstruct the development of the land reform movement. According to incomplete statistics from 124 counties in the Central and Southern District, from November of last year to April of this year, People's Courts received a total of 143,761 cases in connection with the land reform movement. People's Courts in various localities severely suppressed counter-revolutionary elements and unlawful landlords who sabotaged land reform, striking at the arrogance of the counter-revolutionaries and guaranteeing the smooth progress of land reform. For example, in Qianjiang County, Hubei Province, during the land reform movement, 124 unlawful landlords dispersed their property to resist the peasants' struggle. The county's People's Court publicly tried Zhang Kaichun and three other unlawful landlords from the Third District, sentencing them to death and imprisonment respectively. After this, the landlords in the township quickly handed over their hidden property. Because People's Courts in various localities supported the peasants' struggle against the feudal land system, the broad masses of peasants deeply realized: "With the People's Court, the peasants have the power." Vicious and cunning landlords trembled at the mention of the People's Court. The People's Court greatly inspired the peasants' enthusiasm to struggle against the landlord class and counter-revolutionary elements.
    People's Courts in various localities have generally paid attention to following the mass line and utilizing the strength of the masses to complete adjudication work. In many areas, the People's Court has absorbed local respected masses, cadres, representatives of poor peasants and farm laborers, and victims to participate in trials. This not only educated the masses, enabling them to understand how to use the power of the government to conduct struggle, but also, with sufficient witnesses, made it impossible for the accused to quibble about their crimes and forced them to accept legal sanctions. The use of this method also made judgments more accurate. For example, in Feixi County, Northern Anhui, when trying unlawful landlord Zhao Huichuan, the court initially sentenced the criminal to death. However, after the masses reflected that some materials were not yet sufficiently verified, the court re-examined the case and changed the sentence to ten years' imprisonment, avoiding a mistake. The peasants in various localities particularly welcomed the People's Courts' methods of on-the-spot trials and circuit trials.
    In order to widely establish People's Courts, it is necessary to allocate many cadres to engage in this work. Providing specialized training to these cadres is an important condition for doing a good job in the People's Courts. Since February of this year, the various special districts in Henan Province have specially trained more than 900 People's Court cadres, accounting for one-half of the number of People's Court cadres in the province. After receiving training, these cadres further understood the nature and tasks of the People's Court and were better able to correctly grasp the policies of the People's Government.

　　保证土地改革和镇压反革命工作顺利进行
    人民法庭得到广大农民的拥护
    已建立法庭的地区严重打击了不法地主和反革命分子
    【本报讯】正在进行土地改革的地区，广大农民群众普遍要求迅速建立人民法庭，以便顺利地实行土地改革和镇压反革命。
    在去冬今春实行土地改革的农村中，反革命分子和不法地主，曾用各种卑鄙毒辣的手段，如武装袭击，造谣煽惑群众，隐藏财产，杀害耕畜，以及纵火、放毒，顽固地阻挠土地改革运动的开展。中南区根据一百二十四个县的不完全统计，从去年十一月至今年四月，在土地改革运动中，人民法庭共收到案件十四万三千七百六十一件。各地人民法庭对破坏土地改革的反革命分子及不法地主进行了严厉镇压，打击了反革命分子的凶焰，保证了土地改革的顺利进行。如湖北省潜江县在土地改革运动中，有一百二十四个不法地主分散财产，抗拒农民斗争。该县人民法庭公审了三区不法地主张开春等四人，并分别判处死刑、徒刑后，该乡地主便很快交出了隐藏的财物。由于各地人民法庭支持了农民的反封建土地制度的斗争，广大农民深深体会到：“有了人民法庭，农民就有了印把子。”凶恶狡猾的地主，一听到人民法庭，就吓得发抖。人民法庭大大鼓舞了农民向地主阶级和反革命分子进行斗争的热情。
    各地人民法庭多注意走群众路线，运用群众力量，完成审判工作。不少地区的人民法庭曾吸收当地有威信的群众，干部，贫雇农代表及苦主参加审判，这不但教育了群众，使他们懂得运用政权力量进行斗争，同时也由于有了充分的人证，使被告无法诡辩犯罪行为，而接受法律制裁。运用这种办法，并能使判决更加准确。如皖北肥西县在审判不法地主赵惠川时，原已判处该犯死刑，后经群众反映，有些材料还不够确实，就重新研究改判十年徒刑，避免了错误。各地农民对于人民法庭就地审判，巡回审判的办法，尤为欢迎。
    为了广泛建立人民法庭，需要调配很多干部从事这项工作。对这些干部加以专门训练，是做好人民法庭工作的重要条件。河南省各专区自今年二月以后，专门训练了人民法庭干部九百余人，达该省人民法庭干部人数的二分之一。这些干部受到训练后，都进一步认识了人民法庭的性质和任务，更能正确地掌握人民政府的政策。
