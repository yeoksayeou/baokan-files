    Learn from the Soviet Experts' Serious and Responsible Spirit in Basic Construction
    Dai Yunzheng
    This year, I had the opportunity to conduct investigation and research work on basic construction alongside Soviet experts. The Soviet experts' pragmatic working style deeply moved me.
    In the past, the Kuomintang bandit gang hired many engineers from imperialist countries. When they carried out designs, they did not consider Chinese building materials at all; their purpose in coming to China was to open up markets and dump goods for their monopoly capitalists. Soviet experts are fundamentally different from engineers from imperialist countries. They not only do everything possible to help us use domestic materials but also try to use local materials as much as possible. In order to help us build factories, they thoroughly investigated the sources, quantities, and quality of various building materials near the factory site, and recorded these materials on maps for easy reference when using them. The experts also personally visited various factories and mines producing building materials to observe their production processes, operating techniques, machinery and equipment, product specifications, and inquire about their development plans. Because the various brick and tile factories did not have physical and chemical analysis equipment, the experts took back various samples after visiting each factory for precise laboratory analysis.
    Modernized large factories have a close relationship with the weather. The experts collected wind direction, wind speed, temperature, humidity, rainfall, snowfall, and soil freezing depth and period data from all meteorological stations near the factory site so that they could better solve the location, direction, structure, factory building cold protection equipment, and the use of materials of the factory. The experts not only possessed a large amount of materials but also carefully reviewed them. Once, an expert saw that the wind directions recorded by two hydrological stations five miles apart on the same day were exactly opposite. He immediately asked the relevant parties to explain and requested that all materials be strictly reviewed. If the preparation work for our basic construction can be done so sufficiently, many mistakes and wastes will be avoided.
    The water use of a certain place's industry and residents is gradually becoming a problem. The experts treated this problem with a very serious attitude. They worked hard to survey water sources, and as a result, not only solved the water use problem of the factories they planned but also solved the water use problem of the residents and the entire industry in the area for a certain period in the future. They surveyed water sources everywhere, measured the amount of water, analyzed water quality, and made precise irrigation and factory water use plans; and collected information on deep wells in various places near the factory site, such as the location of the wellhead, elevation, wellhead diameter, well depth, water depth, water volume, dynamic water level, static water level, etc., to truly understand the water layer and water source of a certain city.
    Let every comrade on the production front conscientiously learn from the Soviet experts' serious and responsible spirit towards basic construction as a gift to the great holiday of the world's people -- the Soviet October Revolution Day!

    学习苏联专家对基本建设的严肃负责精神
    戴云蒸
    今年我有机会和苏联专家一块进行基本建设的调查研究工作。苏联专家实事求是的工作作风深深地感动了我。
    过去国民党匪帮请过许多帝国主义国家的工程师们。他们进行设计时，根本不考虑中国的建筑材料；他们来中国的目的，就是为他们的垄断资本家开辟市场，倾销商品。苏联专家和帝国主义国家的工程师则根本不同。他们不但尽一切可能帮助我们使用国产材料，并且尽量作到就地取材。为了帮助我们建厂，他们详尽地调查了厂址附近各种建筑材料的来源、数量、质量，并把这些材料记载在地图上，以便使用时一目了然。专家们还亲自到各个生产建筑材料的厂矿，参观其生产过程、操作技术、机器设备、产品规格，并询问其发展计划。各砖瓦厂没有物理与化学分析设备，专家们在各厂参观后，就带回各种样品，以便进行精密的化验。
    现代化的大工厂和气象有着密切的关系。专家们搜集了所有厂址附近各气象站的风向、风速、气温、湿度、雨雪量，以及土地冻结深度和时期等材料，以便根据这些材料，更好地解决工厂的位置、方向、结构、厂房的御寒设备，与材料的使用等问题。专家们不但大量占有材料，并对材料进行慎重地审查。有一次，一位专家看到同一天相距五里的两个水文站记载的风向恰恰相反，他立刻请求有关方面予以解释，并请求将全部材料加以严格的审查。如果我们基本建设的准备工作都能做得这样充足的话，就将避免很多错误和浪费。
    某地工业与居民的用水逐渐感到问题。专家们以十分严肃的态度对待这一问题。他们努力勘察水源，结果，不但解决了他们所筹划的工厂本身用水问题，而且也将解决今后一定时期内该地居民用水与整个工业用水问题。他们到处勘察水源，测量水量，分析水质，做出精密的灌溉以及工厂用水计划；搜集厂址附近各地的深井资料，如井口的位置、海拔标高、井口直径、井深、水深、水量、动水位、静水位等，以确实了解某市的水层及水源。
    让我们每一个生产战线上的同志认真地学习苏联专家对待基本建设的严肃负责精神，作为对伟大的世界人民的节日——苏联十月革命节的献礼吧！
