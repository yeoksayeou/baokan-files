　　Jiangxi Ninggang County Farmers Enthusiastically Deliver Grain
    The farmers of Ninggang County, Jiangxi Province, are enthusiastically delivering patriotic public grain. At the seventh session of the People's Representative Conference held in the county in late September, farmer representatives spoke enthusiastically, expressing their determination to pay public grain as soon as possible, and guaranteeing to dry and winnow it cleanly and deliver the best grain, in order to strengthen the power to resist US aggression and aid Korea with practical actions. Cadres and farmer representatives from Longshi Town in the urban area held a meeting on the evening of the day the county representative conference ended to publicize the message to the masses, and worked day and night to conduct investigations, evaluations, and other work; in one and a half days, they completed the task of delivering more than 190,000 catties of public grain. The farmers of Longshi Town were so busy that they didn't sleep at night in order to dry and load the grain well. The masses in Gucheng Township sent grain in the middle of the night. In the work of delivering grain, everyone also displayed a spirit of mutual assistance and love. For example, labor model Xiao Shengfu, in addition to paying all of his own public grain, also lent more than ten dan of public grain to others. Chen Fuying and Xiong Shuisheng of Longshi Town, etc., specially took time to help three families of revolutionary soldiers deliver public grain.
