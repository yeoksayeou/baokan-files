    Explaining Communism to Party members and the masses is a very serious task. Teachers who lecture on Communism must make full preparations before lecturing, carefully consider or research questions before answering them, and be even more cautious when drawing conclusions. The responsible comrades and teachers of the training class for township cadres of the CPC Minhou (Fujian) District Committee, without deep consideration and research of the questions raised by the students, answered them casually, even explaining socialist collective farms as the current agricultural production cooperatives, saying that "the development of collective farms is from the '30-70' profit sharing of land and labor to '20-80', '10-90' until complete 'distribution according to labor'." This is obviously wrong. This kind of explanation will confuse the students and have serious bad consequences. In fact, anyone with some basic knowledge of Communism knows that the land of socialist collective farms is state-owned; all kinds of farm tools, draught animals, public buildings and other public property in collective farms are owned by all the farmers in the village; all the harvests in the farm, after paying taxes to the state, are fairly and reasonably distributed within the collective farm, leaving a part for next year's production, a part for the welfare of all the farmers in the village, and the rest are distributed according to the amount of labor spent by each farmer.
    At present, communist education is being widely carried out for Party members and the masses in various places. Therefore, we must oppose this kind of unserious and irresponsible attitude of pretending to know what one does not know, and we must, as Kalinin said: "Do not evade answering, nor perfunctorily deal with the questions raised. If you cannot answer a certain question on the spot, then frankly tell everyone: 'The question is very good and very important, and I am very willing to answer it, but now I am not prepared for it, I have not considered it well, so it is difficult to answer. I will clarify the question and study it with the comrades, and then answer you.'"

    必须正确地讲解共产主义
    向党员、向群众讲解共产主义，是一件十分严肃的工作。担任讲解共产主义课程的教员，在讲解前必须作充分的准备，解答问题时要经过认真的考虑或研究，作结论更应该慎重。中共福建闽侯地委乡干部训练班的负责同志及教员，对学员提出的问题未经深刻考虑与研究，即随便解答，以致把社会主义的集体农庄解释成为目前的农业生产合作社，说什么“集体农庄的发展，是由土地、劳力的‘三七’分红到‘二八’、‘一九’直到完全‘按劳分配’。”这显然是错误的。这种解释会使学员的思想混乱，发生严重的恶果。其实只要有些共产主义常识的人，都知道社会主义的集体农庄的土地是国有的；集体农庄中的各种农具，耕畜，公共建筑及其他公共财产归全庄农民所有；农庄中的一切收获品，除了向国家缴税以外，在集体农庄内进行公平合理分配，留下一部分准备明年生产，一部分办全庄农民的福利事业，其余的都按照每个农民所花费的劳动分量而进行分配。
    目前各地正在普遍向党员、向群众进行共产主义教育。因此必须反对这种不严肃不负责的、强不知以为知的态度，必须如加里宁所说的：“不要逃避回答，也不要敷衍提出的问题。如果你不能就地回答某一问题，那末就坦白地告诉大家：‘问题很好并且很重要，我非常愿意回答它，只是现在我对它没有准备，我还没有很好考虑过，所以很难回答它。我把问题弄明白，与同志们研究研究，那时再回答你们。’”
