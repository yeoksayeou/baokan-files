Xinhua News Agency, November 4th: The Beijing Municipal Democratic Youth Federation and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League jointly held a grand meeting today to welcome 42 youth representatives from six countries, including Australia, Ceylon, Cuba, Argentina, Chile, and South Africa, who were invited by the All-China Democratic Youth Federation and the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League to visit China.  Attending the meeting were Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League; Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the All-China Democratic Youth Federation and Deputy Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League; Qian Sanqiang, Vice Chairman of the All-China Democratic Youth Federation; Zhang Dazhong, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Democratic Youth Federation and Deputy Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League; and more than 800 youth representatives from all walks of life in the capital.

　　The meeting was presided over by Zhang Dazhong. After delivering a welcoming speech, Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the All-China Democratic Youth Federation, spoke. Liao Chengzhi, on behalf of the Chinese youth, warmly welcomed the youth representatives of various countries to visit China. After introducing the enthusiastic participation of Chinese youth in the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement and the work of national construction, he said: Chinese youth have deeply experienced from long-term struggles that as long as all peace-loving and just people and youth in the world unite extensively, they will surely be able to smash the conspiracy of US imperialism to launch aggressive wars and win lasting world peace. Chinese youth will always be loyal comrades-in-arms of youth of all countries in the struggle to defend world peace and strive for a better future for youth.

　　Combat hero of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Tang Fuhou, and female train driver, Tian Guiying, successively stood up to speak. They introduced the great contributions made by the national youth and women to the motherland in the vigorous Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement.

　　Then, the head of the Australian youth delegation, Thomas, spoke. He said: The Australian people and youth love peace just like the Chinese people and youth. Recently, a public opinion poll was held in Australia, and two-thirds of the people opposed the US imperialist "peace treaty with Japan" and the war of aggression against Korea. This time, we come to visit and study in New China, and we have seen the great achievements made by Chinese youth under the leadership of the Communist Party, especially their spirit of self-sacrifice in participating in Resist-America, Aid-Korea, which has given us Australian youth great encouragement.

　　The head of the Ceylon youth delegation and General Secretary of the Ceylon Democratic Youth League, Stanley, spoke. He said: Ceylon youth are proud to be able to meet Chinese youth. Because the experience of the Chinese people's liberation struggle is exactly what the Ceylon people need to learn now. Especially today, when the Anglo-American war-mongers are building and expanding naval and air bases in Ceylon and attempting to use these bases to invade other Asian countries, the Ceylon people must strengthen their unity with the heroic Chinese people, the vanguard of peace in Asia, to defend world peace. Now British imperialism and its lackeys in Ceylon are attempting to use Ceylon youth to join the imperialist army, but some Ceylon youth have refused. On the contrary, they demanded to go to the Korean front as volunteers to fight the American bandits who are trampling on the Korean people. Therefore, we can say with full confidence: if the imperialists foolishly launch a third world war, the Ceylon youth will resolutely answer the imperialists that not a single Ceylon youth will point their guns at the great People's Republic of China, and the Ceylon youth will stand on the side of the world peace and democracy camp headed by the powerful Soviet Union, and defeat the war-mongers.

　　The head of the Cuban youth delegation and General Secretary of the National Committee of the Cuban Socialist Youth League, Weivo, said: Cuban youth have long known the heroic struggle deeds of the Chinese people and youth. In particular, the birth of the People's Republic of China has greatly encouraged the confidence of Cuban youth in overcoming imperialist oppression. Now, Cuban youth have recognized from the struggle of the Chinese people that imperialism is a paper tiger, and deeply realize that the struggle for democracy and peace in the world will surely be victorious.

　　The head of the Argentine youth delegation, Vilfredo, then spoke. He said: The arrival of the Argentine youth delegation in China is the first time in the history of China and Argentina. We admire your heroic struggle to defeat US imperialism. After we return to our country, we must tell the youth and people of Argentina about the struggle experience and confidence in defending peace of the Chinese youth.

　　The head of the Chilean youth delegation and General Secretary of the Chilean Youth League, Otis, spoke, saying: When the People's Republic of China was born, the Chilean people and youth, regardless of the police suppression by the puppet government of US imperialism, enthusiastically paraded in the streets to celebrate the victory of the Chinese people. Because this victory will take the Chilean people's revolutionary struggle a step further. This time we visit China, we will definitely learn more revolutionary experience, and we will bring these experiences back to our country, which is the weapon for the Chilean people and youth to fight against imperialism.

　　South African youth representative Siddarth spoke. After introducing the tragic situation of the South African people and youth under the cruel oppression and exploitation of imperialism, he said: The victory of the Chinese revolution is a brilliant path for the colonial people and youth, giving us great lessons and encouragement. After we return to our country, we must further strengthen the struggle against imperialism.

　　The meeting proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere. Afterwards, artistic programs were performed.

    北京市民主青联和青年团北京市委会举行盛会
    欢迎澳大利亚锡兰古巴等六国青年代表
    【新华社四日讯】北京市民主青年联合会和中国新民主主义青年团北京市委员会在今日联合举行盛会，欢迎应中华全国民主青年联合总会和中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会邀请来我国访问的澳大利亚、锡兰、古巴、阿根廷、智利和南非六国青年代表四十二人。到会有青年团中央委员会书记冯文彬，全国民主青年联合总会主席、青年团中央委员会副书记廖承志，全国民主青年联合总会副主席钱三强和北京市民主青年联合会主席、青年团北京市委员会副书记张大中等以及首都各界青年代表八百余人。
    大会由张大中主持。在他致欢迎辞后，即由全国民主青年联合总会主席廖承志讲话。廖承志代表中国青年热烈欢迎各国青年代表来中国访问。他在介绍了中国青年热烈参加抗美援朝运动和祖国建设工作的情况后说：中国青年从长期斗争中深深体验到：只要全世界一切爱好和平和正义的人民和青年广泛地团结起来，一定能粉碎美帝国主义发动侵略战争的阴谋，赢得世界持久和平。中国青年在保卫世界和平和争取青年美好将来的斗争中，永远是世界各国青年忠实的战友。
    中国人民解放军战斗英雄唐福厚、火车女司机田桂英相继起立讲话。他们介绍了全国青年和妇女们在轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动中，对祖国所作的巨大贡献。
    接着，澳大利亚青年代表团长汤姆斯讲话。他说：澳大利亚人民和青年正与中国人民和青年一样的热爱和平。最近澳大利亚举行了一次民意测验，全国就有三分之二的人民反对美帝国主义的“对日和约”和侵略朝鲜的战争。这次我们来新中国访问和学习，看到中国青年在共产党领导下所获得的巨大成就，尤其以自我牺牲的精神参加了抗美援朝，给了我们澳大利亚青年一个极大的鼓舞。
    锡兰青年代表团长、锡兰民主青年联合会总书记斯坦利讲话。他说：锡兰青年能和中国青年见面，是值得骄傲的。因为中国人民的解放斗争经验正是锡兰人民现在所要学习的。特别在今天，当美英战争贩子正在锡兰建立和扩大海空军基地，并企图利用这些基地侵略亚洲其他国家的时候，锡兰人民必须更加强与亚洲和平的前卫——英勇的中国人民的团结，来保卫世界和平。现在英帝国主义及其锡兰的走狗们，并企图利用锡兰青年参加帝国主义军队，但一部分锡兰青年拒绝了。相反地，他们要求到朝鲜前线当志愿军去，要去打蹂躏朝鲜人民的美国强盗。因此，我们可以满怀信心地说：假如帝国主义愚蠢地发动第三次世界大战，锡兰青年将坚决地回答帝国主义，绝没有一个锡兰青年会把枪口向着伟大的中华人民共和国，锡兰青年将站在强大的苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营一边，击败战争贩子。
    古巴青年代表团长、古巴社会主义青年团全国委员会总书记威渥说：古巴青年早已深知中国人民和青年的英雄斗争事迹。尤其中华人民共和国的诞生，大大鼓舞了古巴青年战胜帝国主义压迫的信心。现在，古巴青年从中国人民的斗争中，已认清帝国主义是一只纸老虎，深深认识到全世界民主和平的斗争一定能够得到胜利。
    阿根廷青年代表团长维尔佛烈都接着讲话。他说：阿根廷青年代表团来到中国还是中阿两国历史上的第一次。我们对你们打败了美帝国主义的英勇斗争，表示钦佩。我们回国后一定要把中国青年的斗争经验和保卫和平的信心告诉阿根廷的青年和人民。
    智利青年代表团长、智利青年联盟总书记奥铁斯讲话，他说：当中华人民共和国诞生的时候，智利人民和青年就不顾美帝国主义的傀儡政府的警察镇压，热烈地在街道游行，庆祝中国人民的胜利。因为这胜利将使智利人民革命斗争更前进一步。这次我们访问中国，一定能学到更多的革命经验，我们把这些经验带回国去，正是智利人民和青年反帝国主义的斗争武器。
    南非青年代表西达得讲话。他介绍了南非人民和青年在帝国主义残酷压迫和剥削下悲惨的情形后说：中国革命的胜利是殖民地人民和青年一条光辉的道路，给我们有很大的教训和鼓舞。我们回国后一定更加加强反抗帝国主义的斗争。
    大会在热烈友好的气氛中进行。会后并表演文艺节目。
