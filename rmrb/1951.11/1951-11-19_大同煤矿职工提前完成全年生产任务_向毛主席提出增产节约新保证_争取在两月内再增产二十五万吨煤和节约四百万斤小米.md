Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, November 18th: The entire workforce of the state-owned Datong Coal Mine in Chahar Province has written a letter to Chairman Mao, reporting that they have completed their annual production task one month and twenty-three days ahead of schedule, and expressing their determination to resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call and strive to increase production by another 250,000 tons of coal and save 4 million jin of millet for the country in November and December this year. The letter is as follows:

Dear Chairman Mao:

As the people of the whole country are responding to your call and enthusiastically launching a larger-scale patriotic production increase and conservation movement, all the workers of our Datong Coal Mine are reporting to you with infinite excitement and joy: We have already completed the state production task for the whole year on November 7th, one month and twenty-three days ahead of schedule. Moreover, because we have continuously improved production efficiency and reduced costs, we have also saved the country more than 6.8 million jin of millet worth of wealth.

Over the past year, thanks to your teachings and the education of the great Resist America, Aid Korea movement, we have fully realized that only by striving for the final victory in the Resist America, Aid Korea can we defend the peaceful construction of our great motherland and protect our own happy lives. Therefore, many of our workers have bravely joined the Chinese People's Volunteers and the National Defense Forces. Those of us who remain in the rear are constantly mindful of the heroic slogan "The mine is the battlefield, and the machine is the weapon," and are fulfilling our production tasks with a fighting spirit. Today, we feel infinitely honored to have made the above achievements, and at the same time, we are even more convinced that as long as we continue to work hard, we will surely be able to tap greater potential in production, contribute more to the country, and win greater glory for ourselves.

Dear Chairman Mao: As American imperialism continues to wage aggressive war, threatening the security of the motherland and our happy lives, we firmly remember your instruction: "It is necessary to continue to strengthen the work of Resisting America and Aiding Korea, and it is necessary to increase production and practice strict economy in order to support the Chinese People's Volunteers." At our recent All-Mine Workers' Representative Conference, we resolved to further launch a patriotic production increase and conservation campaign, and strive to increase production by another 250,000 tons of coal and save 4 million jin of millet's worth of funds for the country in November and December this year. Chairman Mao, we resolutely guarantee to you: No difficulty can stop us, and we will definitely complete this glorious task you have given us!

With highest respect!
All Employees of the Datong Mining Bureau, Coal Mine Management Bureau, Ministry of Fuel Industry, Central People's Government
November 8th

Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, November 18th: The workers of the state-owned Datong Coal Mine completed their annual production plan ahead of schedule on the 7th of this month. On November 8th, they wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, resolving to strive to increase production by another 250,000 tons of coal and save 4 million jin of millet worth of funds for the country in November and December this year. As of the 7th of this month, the production volume of Datong Coal Mine increased by 284.24 percent compared with last year. The average production efficiency of all employees in the mine increased by 112 percent compared with last year. The cost was also reduced by 12.68 percent compared with the original plan. The total funds saved for the country by the mine through increased production and reduced costs are worth more than 6.8 million jin of millet.

Last year, most of the mine's shafts were still mined using manual labor and the old room-and-pillar method. In the first quarter of this year, mechanized new mining methods were fully implemented. In order to implement the new mining method, the mine has continuously held various short-term training classes for coal cutting machine drivers, electric drill operators, and mechanical and electrical repair workers, training 385 technicians. Later, the mine also held nine "Advanced Experience Dissemination Classes" for three different types of work: tunneling, stoping, and mechanical and electrical repair. For example, through the "Ma Liuhaizi Advanced Experience Dissemination Class," the tunneling efficiency of the entire mine was generally increased by 45.95 percent; through the "Dissemination Class" on mechanical safety operation experience, the number of accidents in more than 20 mechanical and electrical repair groups in the mine in September was reduced by 86 percent compared with June. Eighty percent of the mine's teams have established a system of technical research associations. Due to the improvement of worker skills and the fuller use of mechanical capabilities, the average production efficiency of the mine's employees in the third quarter of this year increased by 71 percent compared with the first quarter.

    大同煤矿职工提前完成全年生产任务
    向毛主席提出增产节约新保证
    争取在两月内再增产二十五万吨煤和节约四百万斤小米
    【新华社张家口十八日电】察哈尔省国营大同煤矿全体职工写信给毛主席，报告他们已提前一个月零二十三天完成了全年生产任务，并表示要坚决响应毛主席的号召，争取在今年十一、十二两月，再为国家增产二十五万吨煤，节约四百万斤小米。该信如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    当着全国人民正在响应您的号召，热烈展开一个更大规模的爱国增产节约运动的时候，我们大同煤矿的全体职工，以无限兴奋和愉快的心情，来向您道喜：我们已经在十一月七日，提前一个月零二十三天完成全年的国家生产任务了；并且，由于我们不断地提高生产效率，降低成本，我们还给国家节省了六百八十多万斤小米的财富。
    一年来，由于您的教导，和伟大的抗美援朝运动的教育，我们已经完全清楚地认识到：只有争取抗美援朝的最后胜利，才能保卫伟大祖国的和平建设，保卫我们自己的幸福生活。因此，我们已经有许多职工，英勇地参加了中国人民志愿军和国防军。留在后方的我们，更是时刻地铭记着“矿场就是战场，机器就是武器”这一英雄的口号，以战斗的姿态，完成自己的生产任务。今天，我们能够做出上面的成绩，一方面感觉着无限的光荣，同时，我们也更加相信：只要我们继续努力，就一定能够在生产中发掘出更大的潜在能力，为国家贡献出更多的力量，为自己争取更大的光荣。
    亲爱的毛主席：当着美帝国主义还继续进行侵略战争，威胁着祖国的安全和我们幸福生活的今天，我们更牢牢地记着您的指示：“需要继续加强抗美援朝的工作，需要增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”。在我们最近召开的全矿职工代表会上，我们做出决议：要进一步开展爱国主义的增产节约竞赛，争取在今年十一、十二两个月，再为国家增产二十五万吨煤，节约四百万斤小米的资金。毛主席，我们坚决地向您保证：任何困难都阻挡不住我们，我们一定要完成您所给予的这一光荣任务！
    致以崇高的敬礼！中央人民政府燃料工业部煤矿管理总局大同矿务局全体职工
    十一月八日
    【新华社张家口十八日电】国营大同煤矿职工已于本月七日提前完成全年生产计划。十一月八日，他们写信给毛主席，决心争取在今年十一、十二两个月中再为国家增产二十五万吨煤，节约四百万斤小米。到本月七日为止，大同煤矿的生产量比去年提高百分之二百八十四点二四。全矿职工平均生产效率较去年提高百分之一百十二。成本也较原计划降低百分之十二点六八。全矿因增加生产、降低成本而为国家节省的资金共值六百八十多万斤小米。
    该矿去年年底大部分矿井还是用人工和房柱式的旧法开采，今年第一季度即全面实行了机械化的新法采煤。为了实行新法采煤，今年该矿曾连续举办了割煤机司机、电钻打眼工、机电检修工等各种短期训练班，训练了三百八十五个技术工人。后来该矿又举办了九次掘进、回采、机电检修等三种不同工种的“先进经验传播班”。如该矿通过“马六孩先进经验传播班”就使全矿掘进效率普遍提高百分之四十五点九五；通过机械安全运转经验的“传播班”又使今年九月份全矿二十多个机电检修小组的事故次数比六月份降低了百分之八十六。该矿有百分之八十的小组已建立技术研究会的制度。由于工人技术提高和更充分地发挥了机械能力，今年第三季该矿职工平均生产效率即比第一季提高了百分之七十一。
