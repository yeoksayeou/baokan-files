    Strive to Complete and Continue to Expand the Donate Weapons Campaign
    Recently, the campaign to donate weapons by patriotic people from all walks of life across the country has continued to make great progress. As of November 8th, the total amount paid nationwide has reached 3,184.7 billion yuan, accounting for four-fifths of the total pledged. The people of the whole country have practiced and are practicing their patriotic promises. Many regions and units have completed or are approaching completion of the planned targets for donating weapons. Many areas or units that were originally lagging behind have now caught up with the advanced areas and units. It is particularly worth pointing out that places like Shanghai, Zhejiang, Hebei, and Northern Sichuan, based on increasing production and practicing economy, have completed their original donation plans, and the payment figures are continuing to expand. News of excess donations is coming from all over the country. As of the 1st of this month, the amount pledged had reached 3,981.8 billion yuan, equivalent to 2,654 fighter jets. Compared with half a month ago, the number of donated aircraft has increased by more than 36. This great patriotic enthusiasm of the people across the country is exciting.
    However, it should be pointed out that, up to now, the development of the weapon donation campaign in various regions is still uneven. This imbalance is primarily reflected in the payment work, with some being more advanced and some being more backward. There is no doubt that in areas where the payment work is still relatively backward, with the exception of some whose plans are unrealistic and must be reduced as appropriate, the leading organs in all areas where the donation campaign has not been completed as scheduled have the responsibility to quickly strengthen the leadership of the weapon donation campaign in these places. The patriotic movement of donating weapons is of great significance for strengthening the power of the Chinese People's Volunteers. It is obviously wrong if this sacred work is not given enough attention.
    The uneven development of the donation movement is also reflected in the areas that have completed the donation plan. Some movements are still expanding; others have stopped or slackened. The expansion of the weapon donation campaign is carried out under two circumstances. One is that for the whole area, the overall plan has been completed or over-fulfilled, but the smaller units have not all completed it or have completed it very slowly. If these backward places strengthen their leadership and catch up quickly, the entire donation plan will inevitably be exceeded. The other is that although the donation plan has been fully completed or over-fulfilled, the patriotic enthusiasm of the people is very high, and the work of increasing production and practicing economy has been quite successful. Therefore, after completing the plan, they express their willingness to continue donating and strive for greater excess donations before the end of the year, which is of course welcome. However, in some places, after the overall donation plan has been completed, a sense of complacency and slackness has grown. They think that since their donation plan has been completed, the work has come to an end, and there is nothing more to do. They have relaxed their leadership over some units that have not yet fully completed the donation plan, and they have not paid attention to and cherished the patriotic enthusiasm shown by the people in some places during the donation movement. This has brought the movement to a standstill.
    In fact, even in areas where the donation movement has been completed, it is not as if there are no problems. In addition to the units that have not yet been completed and must continue to work hard, the development of the donation movement is still disparate in certain parts, between some regions, between cities, and between various strata. This has led to some places having a large population and a relatively good economic situation, but the donation figures are small; some places have a small population and a poor economic situation, but the donation figures are large; and in places with similar population and economic conditions, the difference in donation figures is also very large. For example, in some places, the economic situation of the business community is actually better than that of the local working people, but the amount pledged by the business community is less than that of the working people. This situation can be improved and should be improved. Some places in Jiangxi, Fujian, and Hubei have already paid attention to solving this problem, and this approach is correct and necessary.
    The Resolution on Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea adopted by the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference called on "continuing to mobilize our manpower, material resources, and financial resources to support the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front"; "completing and continuing to expand the donation of weapons." Comrade Peng Zhen, in his "Report on the Movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country," also called on the people of the whole country to "ensure the completion of the established donation plan within this year." From now until the end of this year, there are only less than two months left. People from all over the country should seize this opportunity, continue to highly promote the spirit of patriotism, make persistent efforts, realize the calls in this resolution and report, and strive to complete and strive to exceed the original donation plan as soon as possible.
    Due to the increasing strength of the air force and artillery units of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, the American aggressors have begun to cry out that their "air superiority" is about to be lost, and admit that they have had to disrupt their global war preparation plans as a result. In the eleven and a half months since the Chinese People's Volunteers joined the war, they have shot down and damaged 2,300 American aircraft. The number of American aircraft losses is increasing day by day. A United Press dispatch from Washington on October 22nd could not but admit that "the loss of American combat aircraft is now more than it can replenish." The increasingly strong Chinese People's Volunteers are inseparable from the active support of the people of the whole country. Work harder to increase production and practice economy, and donate more weapons! We will surely completely and thoroughly defeat the "air superiority" boasted by the United States, and smash the American plan to prepare for world war from Korea!

### 努力完成和继续扩大捐献武器运动

    努力完成和继续扩大捐献武器运动
    近来全国各地各界爱国人民捐献武器的运动继续有很大的进展。到十一月八日为止，全国缴款数字已达三万一千八百四十七亿元，占全部认捐总数的五分之四。全国人民已经实践了和正在实践着自己的爱国诺言，许多地区和单位，已经完成了或正在接近完成捐献武器的预定计划。有些本来落后的地区或单位，现在有很多已经赶上先进的地区和单位。特别值得指出的是像上海、浙江、河北、川北等地，在增产节约的基础上，完成了原来的捐献计划之后，缴款数字还在继续扩大。超额捐献的消息正自各地纷纷传来，到本月一日为止，认捐数额已达三万九千八百十八亿元，相当于二千六百五十四架战斗机。和半月前比较，捐献飞机又增加了三十六架有余。全国人民的这种伟大的爱国主义热情，是令人兴奋的。
    但是，应该指出：直到现在为止，捐献武器运动在各地的发展，还是不平衡的。这种不平衡首先是表现在缴款工作上，有的比较先进，有的比较落后。毫无疑问，在缴款工作还比较落后的地区，除了有的因计划不切实际而必须酌情削减者以外，一切对于捐献运动未能如期完成的地区的领导机关有责任迅速加强对这些地方捐献武器运动的领导。捐献武器的爱国运动，对于加强人民志愿军的威力有着巨大的意义，对于这种神圣的工作如果不予以足够的重视，显然是不对的。
    捐献武器运动发展的不平衡，也表现在已经完成捐献计划的地区。有的运动还正在扩大进行；有的已经停止或松懈下来。扩大捐献武器运动是在两种情况下面进行的。一种是就全区来说，总的计划已经完成或超额完成，但小的单位还没有全部完成或完成得很迟缓。这些落后的地方如果加强了领导，迅速赶上，全部捐献计划势必超过。另一种是捐献计划虽已全部完成或超额完成，但由于人民群众的爱国热情十分高涨，增产节约工作作得较有成绩，因而在完成计划之后，表示愿意继续捐献，争取在年底以前有更大的超额捐献，这当然是值得欢迎的。但是，有的地方在总的捐献计划已经完成之后，却滋长着一种自满和松懈的情绪。他们以为自己的捐献计划既然已经完成了，工作就已经作到尽头，认为再也没有什么事可做了。他们对有些还没有全部完成捐献计划的单位放松了领导，他们对有些地方人民群众在捐献运动中表现的爱国热情也未加重视与爱护。这样就使运动停顿下来了。
    实际上，就是在捐献运动已经完成的地区，也并不是已经没有什么问题了。除了那些尚未完成的单位必须继续努力完成外，在有些地区之间，城市之间，各阶层之间，捐献运动的发展，在某些部分也还是悬殊的。这就发生了有的地方虽然人口多，经济状况比较好，但捐献数字却小；有的地方人口少，经济状况差，捐献数字却大；在人口经济状况相差不多的地方，有的捐献数字的差别也很大。再如有的地方工商界的经济状况实际上超过当地的劳动人民，但工商界的认捐数字却少于劳动人民。这种情况是可以改善也应该改善的。江西、福建、湖北的若干地方，已经注意解决这个问题，这种做法是正确的，必要的。
    中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议关于抗美援朝工作的决议中，号召“继续动员我们的人力、物力和财力，支援朝鲜前线的中国人民志愿军”；“完成和继续扩大捐献武器运动”。彭真同志在“关于抗美援朝保家卫国运动的报告”中，并号召全国人民“保证在今年内完成已订的捐献计划”。从现在到今年年底，只有不到两个月的时间，各地人民应该抓紧这个时机，继续高度发扬爱国主义的精神，再接再厉，实现这个决议和报告中的号召，为早日完成并争取超过原来的捐献计划而奋斗。
    由于我国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的空军和炮兵部队的日益强大，美国侵略者已开始惊叫他们的“空中优势”行将失去，并承认因此不得不打乱他们的世界范围的备战计划。人民志愿军参战后十一个半月中，就击落击伤美机二千三百架。美机损失数字一天比一天多。合众社华盛顿十月二十二日电中就已不能不承认“现在美国作战飞机的损失比它能够补充的要多”。人民志愿军的愈战愈强，和全国人民的积极支援是分不开的。更加努力增产节约，捐献更多的武器吧！我们一定能把美国吹嘘的“空中优势”完全彻底打垮，从朝鲜把美国准备世界战争的计划打得稀烂！
