    The Achievements of the North China Urban-Rural Material Exchange Exhibition

    From February this year to the present, over thirty-one various material exhibitions have been held in major administrative regions, provinces, and cities across the country. According to extremely incomplete statistics, over ten million seven hundred thousand people visited twenty-one of these exhibitions, and the value of goods traded in twenty-three exhibitions reached over 522.2 billion yuan. These exhibitions have all achieved great success. Among them, the largest in scale and most remarkable in achievements was the North China Urban-Rural Material Exchange Exhibition, which lasted one and a half months and closed on the 20th of this month.

    This exhibition concretely demonstrated the superiority of our country's New Democratic system and greatly enhanced the patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of urban and rural people. The more than thirteen thousand exhibits displayed the abundance of resources of our great motherland, especially the significant achievements of the economic recovery and development of the North China region. The production of various agricultural products in North China has approached or exceeded the level before the War of Resistance Against Japan, and cotton production has greatly exceeded it. In 1946, the cotton imported by the Kuomintang government from foreign countries accounted for 75 percent of the domestic cotton production, but now our country is basically self-sufficient in cotton. In 1951, the cotton fields in North China increased by 83 percent compared to 1936. The output of major state-owned industrial products in North China will exceed the highest historical level this year; the output of steel ingots and steel materials will increase seven to eight times compared to the highest historical output. State-owned trade, cooperatives, and private industry and commerce have also developed extensively. Obviously, without the establishment of the People's Republic of China, without the New Democratic state system, it would be unimaginable to achieve these results. The broad masses of viewers concretely saw the loveliness of the great motherland from the countless vivid objects and charts at the exhibition, further understood the superiority of the New Democratic system and the correctness of the leadership of the Central People's Government headed by Chairman Mao, and therefore, naturally enhanced their determination to defend the motherland and consolidate the New Democratic system. The patriotic education received by urban and rural people at the exhibition has already been manifested in action and transformed into material strength. After visiting the exhibition, many workers and staff members voluntarily revised their patriotic production increase and conservation plans; after visiting the exhibition, Li Shunda, a national model agricultural worker, and 43 others jointly wrote to Chairman Mao, guaranteeing to conscientiously implement the patriotic production increase agreement and strive for an even greater harvest next year.

    This exhibition further strengthened the ideological education of the worker-peasant alliance for the people of North China and pointed out a far-reaching future for the broad masses of peasants. Before visiting the exhibition, many peasants and cadres from peasant backgrounds did not recognize the leadership of the working class. They said, "Grain is grown by the peasants, and the world was won by the peasants. The peasants should occupy the leading position. How can you say the working class leads?" There were also many peasants who, because land reform had been completed and production had initially developed, had obtained the life of "thirty mu of land and an ox, with plows, rakes, hoes, and spades," and they believed that life had "reached its peak" and did not need to continue to advance. Some urban people, before actually contacting the peasants, believed that the peasants were backward and ignorant, and therefore looked down on these "country folks." This ideological state of urban and rural people has historical roots. In old China, imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, based in the cities, cruelly exploited the countryside, creating serious divisions and antagonism between urban and rural areas; the victory of the Chinese people's revolution was from the countryside to the cities, and the rural base areas were divided and blockaded by the enemy for a long time, which made it impossible for peasants and even many cadres working in the countryside to have the opportunity to contact large-scale industry and industrial workers; the peasants' small-scale production greatly limited their horizons, making them unaware of the happy life that people could create after mastering machines; many urban people did not understand the great role of Chinese peasants in the people's revolution, and therefore produced wrong and unrealistic views of the peasants. After the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, the divisions and antagonism between urban and rural areas have fundamentally changed, and a relationship of urban-led urban-rural mutual assistance and cooperation has been established. But this new situation was not understood by all urban and rural people for a while. The exhibition used countless objects, pictures, and charts to make urban and rural people, especially peasants, see with their own eyes the high productivity of large machines, the great contribution of the working class to the country, and their strong support for the peasants; and in the process of visiting factories outside the exhibition, the peasants saw with their own eyes the workers' tense and organized labor, and saw the workers' unity and discipline. The peasants saw with their own eyes that the workers were more advanced than themselves, and therefore sincerely recognized and were willing to accept the leadership of the working class. This is one of the major gains of the exhibition. Millions of peasants have established the conscious idea of a worker-peasant alliance led by the working class, which will doubly consolidate our country's people's democratic dictatorship system. The peasants also saw the production and living conditions of Soviet collective farmers in the pictures of the exhibition, and began to realize that their lives were not "good to the top," but "far behind." This broke their conservative and complacent thinking, and they understood that today they must organize and rely on the strength of the collective to develop production, and in the future, when conditions are ripe, they will be able to enter a new and more advanced society under the leadership of the working class. During the exhibition, through worker-peasant carnival meetings, urban-rural people's forums, and individual visits and talks, urban and rural people learned about each other's production, life, and struggles, and changed their one-sided views of each other. In the process of receiving visiting peasants, the urban people more concretely recognized the industrious, brave, and simple excellent qualities of the peasants, and therefore changed their past wrong view of looking down on "country folks," and established the idea of mutual assistance and friendship between urban and rural working people. The new urban-rural relationship has become clear in the people's understanding, which will have a significant impact on further implementing the policy of "urban-rural mutual assistance."

    The exhibition used the method of contrasting the old and the new to point out the direction for the broad masses of urban and rural people to develop industrial and agricultural production and improve industrial and commercial management. In the industrial aspect, the exhibition displayed more than seventy technical improvements and inventions in industry, which were the result of the working class giving full play to their high enthusiasm, using their brains, and improving their work methods. In the agricultural aspect, the exhibition displayed various new records for increasing the yield per unit area, which were the result of the broad masses of peasants practicing mutual assistance and cooperation, creating advanced farming methods, and overcoming various natural disasters. In the industrial and commercial aspect, the exhibition displayed various bad habits and malpractices in the old industrial and commercial management, pointing out its harm to the country, the people, and the private industrial and commercial operators themselves; pointing out that "genuine goods at fair prices" and "small profits and quick sales" are the correct way out for private industry and commerce. This exhibition pointed out the direction of production for the peasants to produce more grain, increase the planting of economic crops, and supply industrial raw materials; pointed out the direction for industrial and commercial operators to face the countryside and support agricultural production; and pointed out the direction for workers and peasants to combine labor and technology. The thorough realization of these directions will surely make the face of our country's industrial and agricultural production change with each passing day.

    This exhibition is also a large market, and the transactions it organized are of a national scale. Trade delegations from all over the country organized extensive transactions in accordance with the principle of "taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both buyers and sellers." Through these transactions, the old trade routes were further restored, and new trade networks began to form. Through these transactions, many large administrative regions established direct trade relations. These transactions were organized and planned, and were established after careful consultation. Conscientiously implementing the contracts and agreements signed at the exhibition can reduce the blindness of local and special products in production and sales, so that both producers and sellers can安心生产 and operate according to the contracts and agreements. In this large-scale transaction, trade delegations from all over the country introduced each other's production period, output, specifications, and prices of local and special products, as well as the demand for local and special products in various places, and then completed large-scale transactions, which turned the transaction process into a process of organizing production. The leading organs also further understood the production and sales of local and special products in the process of organizing transactions, laying a favorable foundation for further guiding production in the future. These transactions were carried out under unified guidance. Therefore, it is possible and has already achieved a rational allocation of materials under existing conditions, and has achieved certain political goals through economic methods. In the tens of billions of yuan of transactions, special consideration was given to the needs of the Northeast region on the front line of national defense, the needs of areas inhabited by ethnic minorities such as Inner Mongolia, Northwest, and Southwest, and the needs of old revolutionary base areas in Northwest and North China and some disaster areas. The promotion of local and special products and disaster relief work are directly combined. This is only possible under the people's democratic dictatorship system.

    This exhibition also has many experiences worth promoting. The first is that it conscientiously implemented the mass line and widely mobilized the forces of all aspects. It mobilized 2,500 people to participate in the preparatory work, and continued to increase the number of staff to 5,000 during the exhibition. They all came from Party and government organs, people's organizations, schools, public and private enterprises, and other units in the five provinces and two cities of North China and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The more than 13,000 exhibits at the exhibition were supplied by public and private enterprises and other industrial and financial and economic departments in the five provinces and two cities of North China and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The exhibition had 1,370 commentators, all of whom came from various regions and systems across the country, including experts, cadres, workers, peasants, shop assistants, and housewives. The citizens of Tianjin gave up 4,000 houses to receive visitors, and more than 9,000 citizens (half of whom were women) volunteered to participate in the reception work of the conference. Second, this exhibition implemented the principle of combining theory with practice. Most of the exhibits were physical objects, followed by models, photographs, pictures, charts, etc., all of which were explained to the audience in popular terms by the commentators. Many industrial inventions and creations were explained by the inventors themselves, which made it easier for the audience to understand the significance of these exhibits. Third, this exhibition implemented the principle of "taking from the conference and using it for the conference," that is, being reasonable and economical in the expenditure of funds, so as to achieve a balance of income and expenditure, and even have a surplus. These experiences have set a good example for material exchange exhibitions to be held in various places. After the end of this exhibition, most of the exhibits, with the consent of various provinces and cities, will be uniformly transferred to the North China Affairs Department of the Central People's Government, and a fixed exposition hall will be established on the original site for people from all walks of life to visit and study for a long time, and continue to play its important role in political education.

    Now some regions are holding similar exhibitions. At these exhibitions, we should promote the experience of the North China Urban-Rural Material Exchange Exhibition, so that this kind of exhibition can become a place for educating the people, a place for organizing trade and organizing production, and so that this kind of exhibition can continue to gain more experience and greater achievements.

    华北区城乡物资交流展览会的成就
    从今年二月至目前为止，全国各大行政区和各省、市举行的各种物资展览会已有三十一起。据极不完全的统计，其中二十一个展览会的观众达一千零七十万人，二十三个展览会中成交的货物价值达五万二千二百余亿元。这些展览会都有很大的成就。其中规模最大、成绩最为显著的则是历时一个半月而于本月二十日闭幕的华北区城乡物资交流展览会。
    这个展览会具体地表现了我国新民主主义制度的优越性，大大地增强了广大城乡人民的爱国主义热情。会上一万三千多种展览品，显示了我们伟大祖国物产的丰饶，特别显示了华北人民经济上恢复和发展的重大成绩。华北的各项农产品生产，已经接近或超过抗日战争以前的水平，棉花产量则已大大超过。在一九四六年，国民党政府从外国输入的棉花，占国产棉花的百分之七十五，现在我国棉花则基本上已能自给。一九五一年华北棉田比一九三六年增加了百分之八十三。华北主要国营工业品的产量，今年将要超过历史上各个时期最高的水平；钢锭、钢材比历史上最高产量将要增加七倍到八倍。国营贸易、合作社、私营工商业也有广泛的发展。很显然，如果没有中华人民共和国的成立，如果没有新民主主义的国家制度，要获得这些成绩，是不可想像的。广大观众从展览会上无数活生生的实物和图表中，具体地看到了伟大祖国的可爱，进一步体会到新民主主义制度的优越性和以毛主席为首的中央人民政府领导的正确，因此，自然而然地提高了保卫祖国、巩固新民主主义制度的决心。城乡人民在展览会中所受到的爱国主义教育，已经表现于行动中，变成了物质力量。许多职工参观展览会后，自动地修订了自己的爱国增产节约计划；全国的农业劳动模范李顺达等四十四人参观展览会后，联名上书毛主席，保证认真地执行爱国增产公约，争取明年更大的丰收。
    这个展览会使华北人民的工农联盟的思想教育进一步加强了，并且给广大农民群众指出了一个远大的前途。在参观展览会以前，许多农民和农民出身的干部不承认工人阶级的领导。他们说：“粮食是农民种的，天下是农民打的，农民应该占领导地位，怎么说工人阶级领导呢？”还有许多农民，由于土地改革已经完成，生产已初步发展，自己获得了“三十亩地一头牛、犁耧钁耙样样有”的生活，他们就认为生活“已经到顶”，不需要继续前进了。若干城市人民，在没有实际接触农民以前，则认为农民落后、愚昧，因而看不起这些“乡下人”。城乡人民的这种思想状况，是有历史根源的。在旧中国，帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义，以城市为据点，残酷地剥削农村，造成城乡之间严重隔阂和对立；我国人民革命的胜利，是由农村而城市，农村根据地长期被敌人分割、封锁，这就使得农民以至许多在农村工作的干部，没有接触大工业和产业工人的机会；农民的小生产，大大限制了他们的眼界，使他们不了解人民掌握了机器以后所能创造的幸福生活；许多城市人民由于不了解我国农民在人民革命中的伟大作用，对于农民也产生了错误的不切实际的看法。在我国人民革命胜利以后，城乡之间的隔阂和对立已经根本改变了，以城市为领导的城乡互助合作的关系建立起来了。但这种新的情况，一时并未为所有城乡人民所理解。展览会以无数的实物、图片、图表，使城乡人民，特别是农民，亲眼看到大机器的高度生产力，看到工人阶级对于国家的伟大贡献和对农民的强有力支持；而在会外参观工厂的过程中，农民们更亲眼看到了工人的紧张的有组织的劳动，看到了工人的团结和纪律性。农民亲眼看到工人比自己先进，因而衷心承认并愿意接受工人阶级的领导。这是展览会的重大收获之一。千百万农民树立了自觉的以工人阶级为领导的工农联盟的思想，将使我国人民民主专政制度加倍巩固起来。农民们从展览会的图片中，还看到苏联集体农民的生产和生活情况，开始发觉自己的生活不是“好到顶了”，而是“差的很多”。这就打破了他们的保守和自满思想，懂得今天要组织起来，依靠集体的力量发展生产，在条件成熟的将来，就能够在工人阶级的领导下，走入新的更高级的社会。在展览会期间，通过工农联欢大会、城乡人民座谈会及个别访问、谈心等形式，城乡人民互相了解了对方的生产、生活和斗争情况，彼此都改变了片面的观点。城市人民在招待参观的农民的过程中，都更具体地认识了农民的勤劳、勇敢、朴实的优秀品质，因而改变了过去看不起“乡下人”的错误观点，树立了城乡劳动人民互助友爱的思想。新的城乡关系在人民的认识中明确起来，这对于进一步贯彻“城乡互助”的政策，将发生重大的作用。
    展览会采用新旧对比的方法，给广大城乡人民指出了发展工农业生产和改进工商业经营的方向。在工业方面，展出了工业中的七十余种技术改进和创造发明，这是工人阶级发挥高度积极性，开动脑筋，改进工作方法的结果。在农业方面，展出了各种提高单位面积产量的新纪录，这是广大农民实行互助合作，创造先进耕作方法，战胜各种自然灾害的结果。在工商业方面，展出了旧的工商业经营中的各种陋规恶习，指出它对于国家、人民和私营工商业者自身的危害性；指出“货真价实”、“薄利多销”，是私营工商业的正确出路。这个展览会，给农民指出了多打粮食、增植经济作物、供给工业原料的生产方向；给工商业者指出了面向农村，支持农业生产的方向；给工人和农民指出了必须实行劳动和技术相结合的方向。这些方向的彻底实现必将使我国的工农业生产的面貌日新月异。
    这个展览会又是一个大市场，它所组织的交易，带有全国性的规模。全国各地的贸易代表团，按照“公私兼顾、买卖两利”的原则，组织了广泛的交易。通过这些交易，旧的贸易路线得到进一步的恢复，新的贸易网开始形成。通过这些交易，许多大行政区之间，建立了直接的贸易关系。这些交易是有组织、有计划的，并且是经过周密协商以后成立的。认真执行在展览会中订立的合同和协议，可以减少土产特产在产销中的盲目性，使产销双方，得以按照合同和协议，安心生产和经营。在这次大规模的交易中，各地贸易代表团互相介绍了土产特产的产期、产量、规格、价格和各地对于土产特产的需求情况，然后大规模地成交，这就是把交易过程变成了组织生产的过程。领导机关也在组织成交的过程中，进一步了解了土产特产的产销情况，为今后进一步指导生产，打下有利的基础。这些交易是在统一指导下进行的。因此，它就可能并且已经在现有条件下实现了物资的合理分配，并以经济方法，达到了一定的政治目的。在上万亿元的交易中，特别照顾了国防前线东北地区的需要，照顾了内蒙、西北、西南等少数民族聚居地区和西北、华北老根据地及若干灾区的需要。把推销土产特产和救灾工作直接结合起来了。这只有在人民民主专政制度下才是可能的。
    这个展览会还有许多值得推广的经验。这首先是它认真地贯彻了群众路线，广泛地动员了各方面的力量。它动员了二千五百人参加筹备工作，在展览期间继续增加工作人员达五千人。他们都是从华北五省二市和内蒙古自治区的党政机关、人民团体、学校、公私企业等单位来的。会上一万三千多种展览品，是华北五省二市和内蒙古自治区的公私企业及其他各大行政区的工业部门和财政经济部门供给的。展览会有一千三百七十个讲解员，都是来自全国各地区、各系统的，其中有专家、干部、工人、农民、店员和家庭妇女。天津市市民让出四千间房子来招待参观者，并有九千多市民（其中半数为妇女）义务参加大会的招待工作。第二，这个展览会贯彻了理论和实际相结合的方针。展览品大部分都是实物，其次是模型、照片、图画、图表等，一一由讲解员向观众进行通俗的解释。有许多工业方面的发明创造，是由发明者本人担任讲解的，这就使观众更加容易了解这些展品的意义。第三，这个展览会实行了“取之于会、用之于会”即在经费开支上合理的和节约的原则，作到收支相抵，并有盈余。这些经验，给各地即将举办的物资交流展览会，做了一个良好的榜样。这个展览会结束后，大部分展览品，经各省市同意，将统一移交中央人民政府华北事务部，在原址成立固定的博览馆，供各界人民长期参观和学习，继续发挥它的政治教育的重大作用。
    现在若干地区，正在举行同样的展览会。在这些展览会上，应该推广华北区城乡物资交流展览会的经验，使这种展览会成为教育人民的场所，成为组织贸易和组织生产的场所，使这种展览会能够继续获得更多的经验和更大的成就。
