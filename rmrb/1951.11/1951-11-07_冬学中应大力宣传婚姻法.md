    The Marriage Law Should Be Vigorously Promoted in Winter School
    Editor: It has been over a year since the promulgation of the Marriage Law, but it has not yet been universally implemented. Many rural cadres and farmers still do not understand the significant meaning of the Marriage Law. For example, Wang Chunda, a cadre of Zang Village, Second District, Rongcheng County, Shandong Province, believes that "the Marriage Law is a divorce law." A member of the Communist Party branch in the village said, "The Marriage Law is a women's law because everything takes care of the interests of women themselves." Among the 283 members of the women's association in the village, 109 women participate in labor production, but their families do not care about their clothing, only about the clothing of the men. This is unequal. In addition, 21 women are beaten and abused by men. Yan Xiulan's husband has an improper relationship with another woman, and Yan Xiulan gets beaten when she mentions it. Some farmers, because they do not understand the Marriage Law, still arrange marriages for their children. For example, the farmer Wang Shitang betrothed his daughter to someone else and spent money, but his daughter was unwilling. Wang Shitang insisted on forcing his daughter to marry, saying, "We spent their money, and if you don't go, we won't be able to pay it back." Some people also slander women's divorce. Some young people feel that freedom of marriage is good, but they do not know how to do it.
    In short, the masses still do not understand the spirit of the Marriage Law, mainly because the publicity of the Marriage Law is not deep enough. Therefore, I suggest that the leading organs of Rongcheng County should pay attention to conducting publicity on the Marriage Law in the winter school this winter to implement the Marriage Law.

### 冬学中应大力宣传婚姻法

    冬学中应大力宣传婚姻法
    编辑同志：婚姻法颁布已经一年多了，可是还没有普遍贯彻下去，有不少农村干部和农民还不了解婚姻法的重大意义。如山东荣成县二区藏村村干部王春达认为“婚姻法就是离婚法”。该村中共支部委员说：“婚姻法是妇女法，因为一切事情都照顾了妇女本身利益。”该村有二百八十三个妇女会会员，其中有一百零九名妇女虽然参加劳动生产，但家里不管她们穿衣，只管男人穿衣问题。这是不平等的。另外还有二十一名妇女受男人的打骂虐待。妇女阎秀兰的丈夫和另一女人搞不正确男女关系，阎秀兰一提就要挨打。有些农民因为不了解婚姻法，还包办儿女的婚姻。如农民王式堂把女儿许给别人，使了钱，但女儿不愿意，王式堂一定逼他女儿结婚，并说：“咱使了人家的钱，你不去，咱还不起。”也有人诬蔑妇女的离婚。有些青年觉得婚姻自由好，可是不知道怎么作。
    总之，群众对于婚姻法的精神还是不了解的，这主要是婚姻法宣传还不深入。因此，我建议荣成县的领导机关应注意在今冬冬学中进行婚姻法的宣传，以贯彻执行婚姻法。
