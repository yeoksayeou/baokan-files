    The October Revolution and Scientific Endeavors
    Hua Luogeng
    In Moscow, where snow was still falling in April, I flew to Tbilisi, the capital of the Georgian Republic, which had already been caressed by the spring breeze, with flowers blooming and the earth green. When I arrived in Georgia, the first question in my mind was to learn about its scientific overview, because I wanted to understand the impact of the October Revolution on the entire Soviet Union from this perspective.
    I like to measure everything from the perspective I am familiar with. To be precise, I was unconsciously making the mistake of looking at problems mechanically, while thinking it was a "scientific" view. That was in 1946, and I had been in the Soviet Union for over a month. Convinced by the beautiful and overwhelming achievements, I was completely certain that the whole world should follow the Russian path, especially semi-feudal and semi-colonial China. But I was still confused about some minor issues. Perhaps it's not superfluous to first describe what I had already affirmed at that time, as well as some doubts, because this can help everyone understand a fragment of my process of gradually knowing, befriending, respecting, and emulating the Soviet Union.
    Not long after the end of World War II, the Soviet Union's glorious victory shocked the world and encouraged everyone who yearned for light. I was completely certain of the Soviet Union's powerful military and organizational strength. Compared with the previous European war, the power of the October Revolution was immediately apparent. Otherwise, how could the army that collapsed at the first blow in the Tsarist era have leaped to become the ever-victorious Red Army?
    Because I had been to the Soviet Union in 1937, I had a clear comparison with the obvious construction situation. I had read some texts describing how workers and peasants lived before the October Revolution, and how workers and peasants live today (referring to that time). So I also affirmed that the construction of the Soviet Union was advancing by leaps and bounds, and people's lives were improving day by day (my visit to the Soviet Union again in 1950 further confirmed this view).
    The achievements of the Soviet Union in science also made me admire them wholeheartedly, especially in the department I am familiar with—mathematics. Not only has it made amazing contributions to the entire development of mathematics, but it has also solved several "eternal" puzzles. For example, Academician Vinogradov's contribution to the Goldbach problem, and Academician Gelfond's solution to a world-famous Hilbert problem (please forgive the reader, I always mention examples from my favorite aspects). So I also affirmed that the scientific development of the Soviet Union was advancing rapidly.
    But pure objectivism harmed me, distorting my view of the problem. I believed that Russia had also had rich scientific achievements in the past. Should this leap-forward advance be entirely attributed to the October Revolution? In other words, if there had been no October Revolution, but merely a "good government" to replace the "rotten regime of the Tsar," would science have grown as vigorously as it did in the Soviet Union at that time? This doubt was thoroughly corrected after visiting Georgia. And later, after going to the United States and delving into their scientific workers, I completely uprooted this view.
    Georgia—an ancient country, I am very unfamiliar with, especially in the field I love. So my first hope when I arrived in Georgia was: to understand the impact of the October Revolution on scientific endeavors from the scientific development situation there.
    Sure enough, I was not disappointed at all. I saw that science in the Georgian Republic was advancing by leaps and bounds. Moskhveshvili and Kupradze, who have long been famous in the mathematics world, were originally Georgians. Their academic achievements were obtained after the October Revolution. They have thousands upon thousands of successors. They publish mathematical journals—publishing papers, and mathematical monographs—publishing lengthy creative thematic research. This was something that China could not hope to match at that time. I discovered at that time that China, which had not undergone the October Revolution, although it had 475 million people and 40 million square miles of land, was far inferior to the Georgian Republic, which had a small population and a small land area. It was then that I fully and unreservedly realized that for the flourishing of science, we must also have a pioneering process similar to the October Revolution in order to prepare our garden suitable for cultivation.
    After visiting Georgia, how eagerly I looked forward to the arrival of the "Chinese October Revolution"! Because only in this way can science take root and sprout. Thanks to Chairman Mao for leading us to turn ourselves over. He has already provided our scientific workers with the basic conditions for development. We can now fully develop our strengths and use our strengths to serve the people. The great October Revolution, it affects the whole world and also affects and helps our China. It enables us to have today—a today where scientists have a place to use their talents—under the leadership of Chairman Mao.

    十月革命与科学事业
    华罗庚
    在莫斯科依然飞着雪花的四月，我飞到了梯别列斯，这是乔治亚共和国的首都，她已经被春风吹拂得花开似锦、碧地如茵了。我到了乔治亚，心头的第一个问题，就是想知道她的科学概况，因为我想从这一角度来了解十月革命对于全苏维埃联邦的影响。
    我喜欢从自己所熟知的角度去衡量一切。切实地说：我那时正不自觉地犯着机械看问题的毛病，而自以为是“科学的”看法。那是一九四六年，我在苏联已经一月有余了。被美不胜搜，目不暇接的优秀成就所说服，我心里已经完全肯定了全世界都应当走俄国人的道路，特别是半封建半殖民地的中国。但对些枝节问题依然有些惶惑。也许这不是多余的，让我先把那时已经肯定的，及有些怀疑的事物，先叙述一下，因为这可以帮助大家了解我对苏联逐步地由认识而友好而敬爱而师法的过程的一个片段。
    世界大战刚结束不久，苏联的辉煌胜利，震惊了全世界，也鼓舞了每个向往光明的人。我完全肯定了，苏联军事力量和组织力量的强大。和上次欧洲大战相比较，立刻就会发现十月革命的力量。不然如何会把沙皇时代一击即溃的军队，一跃而成为百战百胜的红军。
    因为我一九三七年曾到过苏联，所以对有目共睹的建设情况，有一显明的对照。我阅读过若干描写沙皇时代的文字，知道十月革命以前的工农是如何生活着，而今天（指当时）的工农是如何生活着。所以我也肯定了苏联的建设是突飞猛进的，人民的生活日在改善（一九五○年的再次访苏，更证实了这一看法）。
    苏联科学方面的成就，也使我五体投地，特别是我所熟识的这一部门——数学。不但是对于数学的整个发展有了十分惊人的贡献，而且解决了若干“千古不解”的疑案。例如：维诺格拉陀夫院士对古得拔黑问题的供献，葛尔方得院士解决了一个世界著名的希尔伯脱问题（请读者原谅，我提例证总是向我所偏爱的方面提）。所以我也肯定了苏联的科学发展是一日千里的。
    但纯客观主义害了我，使我把问题看得歪曲了，我认为俄国以往也有过丰富的科学成就，这种飞跃式的突进，是否应当完全归功于十月革命。换一句话说，如果没有十月革命，而仅仅是有了“好人政府”来代替“沙皇的腐烂的政权”，是不是科学也会滋长得和当时苏联一般茂盛。这一疑点，到了乔治亚参观后，受到了彻底的校正。而后来到了美国，深入他们的科学工作者之间，才把这种看法连根挖掉。
    乔治亚——这一个古老的国家，我是十分生疏的，特别是我所爱好的领域之内。所以我到乔治亚第一个希望就是：能从那儿的科学发展情况，而了解十月革命对科学事业的影响。
    果然，使我一点也不失望，我看见乔治亚共和国的科学是在突飞猛进着。数学界久负盛名的莫斯黑西维里和古不拉狄司等，原来都是乔治亚人，他们学术成就的获得，都在十月革命之后，他们有着成千成万的后继者，他们所出版的，有数学杂志——刊载论文，和数学专著——刊载长篇的有创作性的专题研究。这是那时候中国所不能望其项背的。我那时发现了：没有经过十月革命的中国，虽然有四亿七千五百万的人，四千万方里的土地，而远远比不上人口不多土地不大的乔治亚共和国。我那时才完全地毫无保留地认识到：为了科学的发荣滋长，我们也必须有类似十月革命的开创过程，才能把我们的园地准备得宜于耕种。
    在参观了乔治亚之后，我的心情是多么迫切地盼望着“中国的十月革命”的到临啊！因为，唯有如此，才能使科学生根发芽。感谢毛主席，领导我们翻了身。已经使我们科学工作者具备了发展的基本条件。我们已经可以充分地发展所长，把我们的所长来为人民服务。伟大的十月革命，它影响着全世界也影响和帮助了我们中国。使我们能够在毛主席领导之下，有了今天——科学家有用武之地的今天。
