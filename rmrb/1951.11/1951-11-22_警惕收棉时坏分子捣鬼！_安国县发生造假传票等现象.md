    Beware of Bad Elements Sabotaging Cotton Purchases!
    Fake Receipts and Other Phenomena Occurring in Anguo County

    To the Editor: In the cotton purchasing work in various parts of Anguo County, instances of bad elements engaging in sabotage and using fake receipts to deceive the public have been continuously discovered. For example, Zhang Weng'er, the temporary accountant hired by the cotton purchasing station in Da Wu Nu Village, Fourth District (a rich peasant with a complex history), forged two cotton sales receipts on October 26th, attempting to fraudulently obtain cash when no one was around. Accountant Wei of the station noticed that the prices written on the receipts were low and the numerals were incorrect, which aroused suspicion. After questioning, it was discovered that neither of the households listed on the receipts had sold cotton. Furthermore, on October 17th, Liu Gui Lin from Bei Qi Gong Village went to the South Gate station to deliver cotton. Because the cotton was not enough to cover the advance deposit, the cotton station asked him to bring more cotton and return it along with the weighing slip. At this time, Liu Gui Lin took the opportunity to sabotage, changing the original weighing slip for 24.4 catties of seed cotton, with a total value of 64,990 yuan, to 124.4 catties, with a value of 369,900 yuan. Due to the suspicious handwriting, it was discovered and reported to the county people's court for legal processing. In addition, the Nan Shi Zhuang Village Cooperative, during cotton collection on the morning of November 4th, found that speculative element Wang Dong Ming from Xi Wang Qi Village was carrying a bag of cotton to the cooperative to sell. After inspection, it was discovered that there was a large stone weighing 6.4 catties wrapped in an old cotton cover inside the cotton. The cotton purchasing station in Da Wu Nu Village, Fourth District, also discovered half a brick weighing two catties in the lint cotton handed over to the county cooperative on the morning of November 9th. The above situations should arouse the high vigilance of cotton purchasing stations in various places to avoid losses to state property.

    警惕收棉时坏分子捣鬼！
    安国县发生造假传票等现象
    编辑同志：安国县各地在收棉工作中，不断发现有坏分子捣鬼和造假单据蒙骗公家的事情。如四区大五女村收棉站雇用的付实会计张瓮尔（系富农成份，历史复杂），十月二十六日，趁无人之际，伪造了两个卖棉传票企图骗取现款。该站魏会计发现传票上写的价格低，字码不对，因此引起怀疑，经过查问，才发现传票上写的两户都没卖棉。又十月十七日，北七公村刘贵林，到南关站交棉，因棉花不够还预付定金，棉站让其再取一部分棉花，和过秤单一同交回，这时刘贵林便乘机捣鬼，把原开的籽棉二十四斤四两、金额总值六万四千九百九十元的过秤单，改成一百二十四斤四两、金额三十六万九千九百元，因字体可疑，被查出呈报县人民法院依法处理。又南仕庄村联社，在十一月四日上午收棉时，西王奇村投机分子王洞明背着一包棉花到社内卖棉，经检查后，发现棉花里面有一块六斤四两用旧棉套包着的大石头。四区大五女村收棉站，在十一月九日上午交县社的皮棉内，也发现有二斤重的半截砖一块。以上情况，应引起各地收棉站的高度警惕，以免国家财产遭受损失。
