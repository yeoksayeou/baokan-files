    Li Xiulan's illness improved and her enthusiasm for production increased after her free marriage
    I met an old lady with half-white hair in Gezhenling Village, Third District, Huixian County, Pingyuan Province. Her maiden name was Zhang, and her husband's name was Li. When I talked to her about the Marriage Law, she excitedly told me about her second daughter's marriage.
    She said: "In 1944, we secretly arranged for our second daughter, Xiulan, to be engaged to the Wu family. She was fifteen years old then. When she was seventeen or eighteen, this area was liberated. She heard that the People's Government advocated freedom of marriage, so she kept clamoring to me to dissolve the engagement. I always said it was 'destined' and that breaking the engagement would be too shameful. Xiulan was so worried that she couldn't eat. In 1948, the groom's family wanted to marry her, but Xiulan refused to go no matter what. There was no way, so I tried to scare her. I didn't sleep all night, and I pretended to hang myself and jump into the well. Xiulan was really frightened, so she agreed to go to the Wu family. But she was really aggrieved! After Xiulan married into the family, she couldn't get along with her husband, they often quarreled, and she was beaten and scolded. Xiulan couldn't bear it, so she often ran back home, and cried to me. Later, she became ill. We were poor, and it was enough to feed her, and we also had to buy her medicine and boil it. Seeing my daughter so thin, I really felt sorry for her. But I still didn't agree to my daughter's divorce. My daughter's illness got worse, and she cried even more. I was worried that my daughter would die. At this time, I became the head of the women's group in the village, and I kept attending meetings, and heard stories about how good it was for girls to marry freely. I thought about Xiulan's matter, and I regretted it. I thought, if my daughter doesn't get a divorce, she will really resent me and die of illness. After thinking about it, I decided to let my daughter apply to the district government for a divorce. At first, the man was unwilling. After the comrades in the district explained it to him, the man agreed. After some time, my daughter freely married a turned-over farmer who had a good job and studied well. My daughter wasn't sick anymore, and her enthusiasm for production increased. She was so busy all day that she didn't even have time to live with her mother's family anymore. Later, my daughter had a child, and when she came to her mother's house, she always talked about production matters with a smile. Her body also became stronger."
    Finally, the old lady said: "I still have two daughters in my family, and I won't care about their marriages. Let them find their own freedom! Free marriage is good."

    李秀兰自由结婚以后，病也好了，生产劲头也大了
    我在平原省辉县三区圪针岭村遇到一位头发半白的老太太。她娘家姓张，夫家姓李。当我和她谈到婚姻法时，她就兴奋地讲起她二闺女的婚事来。
    她说：“一九四四年，俺把二闺女秀兰暗中和武家订了亲，那时她十五岁。她十七、八岁的时候，这块地方解放了。她听说人民政府提倡婚姻自由，就天天和我嚷着要解除婚约。我总说那是“命定的”，退婚多丢人。秀兰成天愁得吃不进饭去。一九四八年，婆家要来娶了，秀兰怎么也不去。没法了，我就想法吓唬她。我一夜没睡觉，又上吊、又跳井，秀兰可真骇怕了，就答应去武家。可是她心里真委屈啊！秀兰嫁过去以后，和她丈夫合不来，常常吵嘴，还挨打、受骂。秀兰受不了，就常常跑回来，回来就对着我哭。后来，她就生起病来。俺穷，供她吃就够受了，还得给她买药、熬药。看着闺女瘦成那样子，我也真心疼。可是我还是不同意闺女离婚。闺女的病更重了，更哭得厉害了，我耽心闺女要死去。这时候，我在村里当上了妇女组长，不断地开会，听到了一些闺女们自由结婚如何好的故事。我想起秀兰的事，我后悔了。我想，闺女要不离婚，她真会怨死、病死的。想来想去，我决定让闺女到区政府去申请离婚。起初男方还不愿意。经区里同志们解说后，男方同意了。过了一些时候，闺女和一个工作好、学习好的翻身农民自由结婚了。闺女不病了，生产劲头也大了，成天忙得也没工夫再住娘家啦。后来闺女生了小孩，有时来娘家，总是笑嘻嘻地谈生产的事。她的身体也结实起来了。”
    最后，老太太说：“俺家里还有两个闺女，她们的婚事我可不管了。叫她们自由去找吧！自由结婚就是好。”
