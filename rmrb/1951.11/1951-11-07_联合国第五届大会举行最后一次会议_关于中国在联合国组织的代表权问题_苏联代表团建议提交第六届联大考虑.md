Xinhua News Agency, November 6th: TASS, Paris - The final meeting of the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly was held on November 5th at the Palais de Chaillot in Paris, on the eve of the opening of the Sixth General Assembly. As is well known, the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly began in New York last September, and its work has been dragged on for thirteen and a half months in violation of all recognized rules of the United Nations.

The President of the Fifth General Assembly, the Iranian representative Ardalan, pointed out that the Fifth General Assembly did not make any decision on the report of the Special Committee established according to the General Assembly's decision to consider the issue of China's representation in the United Nations organization. Ardalan suggested paying attention to this report, which stated: The committee proved unable to resolve this issue.

The Soviet representative Malik opposed the President's suggestion. Malik said that the importance of the issue of China's representation in the United Nations organization is well known. The consideration of this issue has been delayed intolerably. The Committee on China's Representation, established by the Fifth General Assembly, has not put forward any concrete proposals. It is surprising that the committee failed to put forward its suggestions on such an important international issue until the end of the Fifth General Assembly, which was delayed for so long. In examining this issue, it is necessary to start from the fact that it is now time to end the United Nations' unfair attitude towards China and the great Chinese people.

This attitude is the result of various hostile conspiracies by certain countries against China and the 475 million Chinese people. The Chinese people should have their representatives in the United Nations, because they are legally entitled to send representatives.

Malik pointed out that suggesting paying attention to the Special Committee's report on the issue of China's representation is tantamount to suggesting that the issue be considered closed. Malik said: However, this issue cannot be closed until the representatives of the only legitimate Chinese government—the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China—participate in the work of the United Nations organization. In view of this, the Soviet delegation believes that it is necessary to recommend that this issue be submitted to the Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly for consideration. Malik, on behalf of the Soviet delegation, put forward the following proposal: "In view of the fact that the Special Committee for the Study of the Question of Chinese Representation in the United Nations has failed to make recommendations on the question of Chinese representation in the United Nations, the General Assembly decides to refer this question to the Sixth General Assembly for consideration." The representative of the Kuomintang clique expressed opposition.

The Polish representative Katz-Suchy supported the Soviet delegation's proposal. The Polish representative emphasized: The report submitted by the Special Committee for the Study of the Question of Chinese Representation is meaningless. Although the committee had ample time, it did not complete its task. Moreover, some members of the committee have tried every possible way to obstruct the drafting of proposals on the issue of Chinese representation. Therefore, China still has no representatives in the United Nations organization.

The Czechoslovak representative Topol said: The Czechoslovak delegation fully supports the proposal put forward by the Soviet delegation.

The President then put the proposal to a vote. Eleven delegations voted in favor, eleven delegations abstained (including Britain and France), and twenty delegations voted against.

Malik declared: Since the Soviet proposal has been rejected, the Soviet delegation reserves the right to re-submit the issue of Chinese representation in the United Nations at the Sixth General Assembly.

At the end of the meeting, the representatives of Brazil, Britain, the United States, the Philippines, France, and India, among other countries, spoke in exaggerated terms about the so-called achievements of the Fifth General Assembly.

The Soviet representative Malik pointed out: This assessment of the work of the Fifth General Assembly is unacceptable because it does not correspond to the facts.

Then the President Ardalan declared the closing of the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly.

### 联合国第五届大会举行最后一次会议  关于中国在联合国组织的代表权问题  苏联代表团建议提交第六届联大考虑

    联合国第五届大会举行最后一次会议
    关于中国在联合国组织的代表权问题
    苏联代表团建议提交第六届联大考虑
    这个提案横遭否决；马立克宣布保留在第六届联大重新提出中国代表权问题的权利。
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社巴黎讯：联合国第五届大会最后一次会议于十一月五日在第六届大会开幕前夕，在巴黎夏乐宫举行。众所周知，联合国第五届大会是去年九月在纽约开始的，它的工作违反一切公认的联合国规则而拖了十三个半月。
    第五届大会主席伊朗代表安迪让指出，第五届大会并未对根据大会决定而成立的考虑中国在联合国组织的代表权问题的特别委员会的报告作任何决定。安迪让建议注意这个报告，这个报告说：委员会证明不能解决这个问题。
    苏联代表马立克反对主席的建议。马立克说，中国在联合国组织中的代表权问题的重要性是尽人皆知的。对这个问题的考虑已拖延得令人难以容忍。第五届大会决定成立的这个关于中国代表权问题的委员会并未提出具体建议。委员会直到拖得非常之久的五届联大结束的时候，还未能对这种重要国际问题提出它的建议，这不能不令人感到惊奇。在审查这个问题时，必须从这样一个事实出发，即现在是结束联合国对中国、对伟大中国人民的不公平的态度的时候了。
    这种态度是某些国家对中国及四亿七千五百万中国人民采取各种敌对阴谋的结果。中国人民应该在联合国有他们的代表，因为他们在法律上是有权派代表来的。
    马立克指出，建议注意特别委员会关于中国代表权问题的报告，就等于建议把这个问题看做已算结束。马立克说：但是，在唯一合法的中国政府——中华人民共和国中央人民政府的代表参加联合国组织的工作之前，这个问题是不能结束的。鉴于这一点，苏联代表团认为有必要建议把这个问题提交联合国第六届大会考虑。马立克代表苏联代表团提出下列提案：“鉴于研究中国在联合国的代表权问题的特别委员会未能就中国在联合国代表权问题提出建议，大会决定把这个问题移交第六届大会考虑。”国民党集团的代表表示反对。
    波兰代表卡茨·苏琪支持苏联代表团的建议。波兰代表着重指出：研究中国代表权问题的特别委员会所提出的报告是毫无意思的。虽然委员会有充分的时间，但它并未完成它的任务。不仅如此，委员会的若干委员曾千方百计地阻挠草拟关于中国代表权问题的建议，因此，中国在联合国组织中仍然没有代表。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表托波尔说：捷克斯洛伐克代表团完全支持苏联代表团提出的提案。
    于是主席就把这个提案提付表决。十一个代表团投票赞成，十一个代表团弃权（包括英国和法国），二十个代表团投票反对。
    马立克宣称：苏联提案既被否决，苏联代表团保留在第六届大会重新提出中国在联合国代表权问题的权利。
    在会议结束时，巴西、英国、美国、菲律宾、法国、及印度等国代表用夸大的词句论及第五届大会获得的所谓成就。
    苏联代表马立克指出：对第五届大会工作的这种估计是不能被人接受的，因为这与事实不符。
    接着主席安迪让宣布联合国第五届大会闭幕。
