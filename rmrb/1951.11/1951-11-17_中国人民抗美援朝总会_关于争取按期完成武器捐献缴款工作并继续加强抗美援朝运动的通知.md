　　The China Peace Committee
    Notice Regarding Striving to Complete the Weapon Donation Payment Work on Schedule and Continuing to Strengthen the Resist-America, Aid-Korea Movement
    Since the Association issued the call for the weapon donation movement on June 1st, thanks to the great patriotic enthusiasm of the people of all circles across the country, and thanks to the strong leadership and cooperation of various aspects in various places, great achievements have now been made. As of November 15th, the total amount pledged by the people nationwide has reached more than 41,124 billion yuan, and the amount paid by various places has reached more than 34,700 billion yuan (accounting for 84.5% of the total pledged). In the period of about half a month after the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference announced the resolution on strengthening the Resist-America, Aid-Korea work on October 24, it received more than 10,000 billion yuan in donations. The great achievements gained in this movement have given great spiritual encouragement and material support to our Chinese People's Volunteers and will have a great effect on striking the American-led invading army. Now the pledging work nationwide has been successfully completed. Therefore, the Association specially proposes to the patriotic compatriots of the whole country:
    (1) It is hoped that all localities will strive to complete the collection work of weapon donations around the end of this year in order to announce the end of the donation movement on schedule.
    (2) Except for a very small number of areas where the donation movement was launched relatively late, because the pledging work is still starting and the enthusiasm of the masses is very high, the donation should continue to be appropriately expanded on a voluntary basis. The pledging work in all other areas should be stopped immediately, and the focus of the donation work should be placed on the collection of money.
    (3) In the process of collecting money, if it is found that there is forced donation or difficulty in paying, the donors should be advised not to force the donation. It is necessary to ensure that all donations are not only voluntary by the donors but also within their capabilities.
    (4) After the weapon donation movement is completed, the Resist-America, Aid-Korea work should focus on carrying out the patriotic production increase and frugality movement, while continuing to develop and deepen patriotic propaganda and education, thoroughly eliminating all special agent spies and all aggressive activities of imperialism in China, further popularizing and deepening the patriotic covenant movement, and strengthening the work of giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and the families of soldiers.
       The China Peace Committee, November 16, 1951

　　中国人民抗美援朝总会
    关于争取按期完成武器捐献缴款工作并继续加强抗美援朝运动的通知
    自从本会六月一日发出捐献武器运动的号召以后，由于全国各界同胞发扬了伟大的爱国主义热忱，由于各地均有各方面的有力领导和配合，现在已经获得了伟大的成绩。截至十一月十五日止，全国人民认捐总数已达四万一千一百二十四亿余元，各地缴款数目已达三万四千七百余亿元（占认捐总数百分之八十四．五）。在十月二十四日中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会公布关于加强抗美援朝工作决议后约半个月的期间，即收到捐款一万余亿元。这个运动所获得的伟大成绩给予我国人民志愿军以很大的精神鼓舞和物质支援，对于打击以美国为首的侵略军将有很大的作用。现在全国的认捐工作，已顺利完成。因此，本会特向全国爱国同胞提议：
    （一）希望各地争取于本年年底前后完成捐献武器的收款工作，以便按期宣告捐献运动的结束。
    （二）除捐献运动发动较迟的极少数地区，因为认捐工作还正在开始，群众热情很高，尚应继续在自愿基础上适当扩大捐献外，其他所有地区的认捐工作，应即停止，并把捐献工作的重点，放在收款方面。
    （三）在收款过程中，如发现有勉强捐献或缴款困难的情形时，应劝告捐款人不要勉强捐献。务必保证一切捐献不但是捐献者自愿的而且是量力而行的结果。
    （四）捐献武器运动完成后，抗美援朝工作应以开展爱国增产节约运动为中心，同时继续发展和深入爱国主义的宣传教育，彻底肃清帝国主义在中国的一切特务间谍分子和一切侵略活动，进一步普及和深入爱国公约运动，并加强优待烈士家属、军人家属的工作。
       中国人民抗美援朝总会　一九五一年十一月十六日
