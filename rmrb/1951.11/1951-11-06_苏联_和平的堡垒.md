Since returning home from the Fifth Congress of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers in Berlin this September, I have felt more keenly than ever before that peace is the common and resolute demand of the people of all countries. This June, I visited the German Democratic Republic once, and from my personal contact with people from all walks of life in Germany, I knew that their demand for peace was as strong as that of the people in any country I passed through on my journey from Beijing to Berlin. When I visited the German Democratic Republic for the second time, I met various people from many different countries, and from them I saw the same strong desire to safeguard world peace. This is the will of the people of all countries that the democratic jurists brought to Berlin, and this will was fully expressed in the discussions at the congress. The various legal issues we discussed, such as the Chinese delegation's indictment and punishment of Japanese war criminals, would become meaningless once they were separated from the larger proposition of world peace. Law has always been supposed to obey the political demands of the people. In Berlin this time, law played such a correct role. In the most acute political issues of the moment, it serves the interests of the people—that is, to safeguard world peace.

Yes, this trip from the Soviet Union to the German Democratic Republic gave me a profound education—that is, peace, and how to strive for peace! The most unforgettable impression was the atmosphere of peace that permeated the Soviet Union everywhere. This May, when I went to the Soviet Union to participate in the May Day celebrations, I had many opportunities to get to know this country, which is engaged in great peaceful construction. Later, in a month's time, I visited many cities, including Leningrad and Gorky, as well as the vast countryside. Everywhere there were newly built buildings, people's buildings, workers' residential areas, and various enterprises to improve the living standards of the Soviet people. I talked to all kinds of people—workers, students, artists, government cadres, and so on. I often felt that the theme of their conversations was always inseparable from peaceful construction. War hysteria simply does not exist in the Soviet Union; in fact, there, inciting war hysteria is a crime punishable by law. In the socialist land, the cause of peace is above all else.

Among the great scenes of peaceful construction in the Soviet Union, one of the most noteworthy is the nearly completed new building of Moscow University. For a traveler flying into the capital of this socialist country, it is truly a magnificent sight! This prominent skyscraper can be seen from afar. And this is a skyscraper for learning, where enthusiastic and studious young men and women will improve their knowledge to improve the living standards of the people. How different this is from the skyscrapers of New York! There, the people who rule America today and who vainly try to control other nations are greedily pursuing bloodstained profits and other conspiracies all day long. Moscow University has thirty-six floors, one hundred elevators, and other modern new equipment. Upon completion, it will accommodate six thousand students. The various learning conditions prepared for students in this institution of higher learning will be unparalleled in the world.

In my seventy-eight years of life, I have seen a lot of the world, but I felt bewildered in the face of this magnificent building that towers over the Moscow skyline. It was not its size and shape, but what the construction of this new learning center symbolized that bewildered me. Like all other construction projects in the Soviet Union, it has nothing to do with "war preparation." The Soviet regime's huge construction spending of tens of billions of rubles, such as this Moscow University, the Volga River, the Dnieper River, and the hydroelectric power stations on the Amu Darya River, as well as the Turkmen Main Canal, are all construction projects of a scale that only a great country that adheres to a policy of peace can carry out. What a sharp contrast this is to the United States, which boasts that by the end of 1952, it will have eight million workers engaged in war industrial production!

When I stood in front of the magnificent building of Moscow University, pondering the significance of the Soviet Union's post-war construction projects of the same magnitude, my thoughts naturally went back to the October Revolution of 1917, which gave rise to today's great socialist country. This historically dynamic event laid the foundation for building a socialist country on one-sixth of the earth's land. In order to better build and transition to a communist society, peaceful conditions are necessary. Therefore, for more than thirty years, the Soviet Union's foreign policy has consistently been based on "peace." But the rulers of capitalist countries cannot and will not prosper in peace. Peace would deprive the merchants of death of the profits they seek. They do not believe that the socialist and capitalist systems can coexist peacefully, because they know that in the pursuit of peace, the decadent capitalist system cannot win the competition. That is why these capitalists, despite having suffered the bitter lessons of armed intervention, continue to threaten the Soviet Union with war. Nevertheless, the forces of peace, led by the Soviet Union, have grown to an extremely strong level.

The Soviet Union is not only building for peace within its own country, but it is also steadfastly pursuing a foreign policy of maintaining peaceful relations with other countries and helping friendly countries in their peaceful construction. I saw the manifestation of this great internationalist spirit of the Soviet Union in the German Democratic Republic. I remember that an entrepreneur in Germany once told me how German industry had recovered with the help of the Soviet Union. Unlike the Ruhr area controlled by Wall Street, there are no "cartels" here, and no additional "political conditions" are attached. The Soviet Union provides assistance to the German people in order to restore their war-torn industry and meet the needs of the people. How different this is from the doings of the Krupps and Adenauers controlled by the American "governors"!

In West Germany, which is controlled by Wall Street, all industries have been drawn into military production to supply the needs of those "European armies" and "North Atlantic Alliance armies," etc. German youth are being crammed into the machinery of aggressive war. However, in the German Democratic Republic, the people are using Soviet aid to produce what they themselves need most. They have no fear that the goods they produce will be used to destroy themselves or others. The people of the German Democratic Republic wholeheartedly support the Soviet Union's policy of peace, and they are building a peaceful and happy life.

New China is another example of the Soviet Union helping other people in peaceful construction. Without such massive and invaluable assistance from the Soviet Union, it would have been impossible for the Chinese people to achieve such outstanding achievements in the past two years. The Soviet Union's assistance to New China is given in the true spirit of internationalism. This is manifested in many ways. I particularly remember the warmth with which a worker in Gorky shook my hand, which I had never felt before. Although I didn't understand a single word he said at the time, I could understand from his smile how deep the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union was. Later, a translator told me that he said: "China is so lucky, now the people have Mao Zedong!" During our stay in the Soviet Union, there were many similar experiences; people came from afar to express their warm and deep friendship. It is this great friendship of the Soviet people towards New China that is being transformed today into concrete assistance of inestimable value to help us build a new democratic society!

But, in fact, the assistance that New China has received from the Soviet people is far more than the assistance that has created its current outstanding achievements. The rebirth of the Chinese nation is one of the direct results of the success of the Soviet October Revolution. When I first saw the "Winter Palace" in Leningrad, which was captured by the revolutionaries and symbolizes the victory of the October Revolution, and the "Aurora" warship that shelled the "Winter Palace," I couldn't help but think of Chairman Mao's words:

"Before the October Revolution, the Chinese people did not know Lenin and Stalin, nor did they know Marx and Engles. The salvo of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism. The October revolution helped the advanced elements of the whole world and also of China, to use the proletarian world outlook as an instrument for observing the destiny of the country and to reconsider their own problems. Follow the road of the Russians—this is the conclusion."

Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese people have embarked on this road, thereby bringing the powerful People's Republic of China to Asia. If it were not for learning the lessons of the October Revolution—using the Marxist-Leninist proletarian world outlook as an instrument for observing the destiny of the country—the Chinese people would not have achieved victory and would not have brought 475 million people into the already powerful international peace camp led by the Soviet Union.

The emergence of the People's Republic of China has powerfully changed the balance of power, making it greatly favorable to the peace camp. The alliance between the people of China and the Soviet Union, marked by the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, has made the camp of peace, democracy and socialism, led by the Soviet Union, even stronger and invincible. The friendship between the people of the two countries, stemming from the great October Socialist Revolution, will enable the world to safely weather all the crises planned by the warmongers, and will eventually lead the whole world into the era of people's peace and democracy.

    苏联——和平的堡垒
    沈钧儒
    我从今年九月在柏林召开的国际民主法律工作者协会第五届代表大会回国以来，比过去任何时候更亲切地感觉到和平是各国人民共同的坚决要求。今年六月里，我曾到过一次德意志民主共和国，从我个人与各阶层的德国人民的接触中，我知道了他们对和平要求的强烈是与我从北京到柏林旅途中所经过的任何一国的人民相同的。当我第二次访问德意志民主共和国时，我遇到了从很多不同国家前来的各种不同的人物，从他们那里我又看到了同样强烈的维护世界和平的愿望。这就是民主法学家们带到柏林的各国人民的意志，这个意志在大会的讨论中充分地表现了出来。我们所进行的各种法律问题的讨论，例如，中国代表团所提出的对日本战争罪犯的检举与惩罚，一旦离开了世界和平这个更大的命题，就会变得毫无意义。法律从来就应该是服从人民底政治要求的。这次在柏林，法律就起了这样的正确作用。在当前最尖锐的政治问题里，它是服务于人民的利益的——即维护世界和平。
    是的，这次从苏联到德意志民主共和国的旅行，给了我一个印象深刻的教育——那就是和平，以及如何争取和平！最使我难以忘怀的印象是在苏联到处弥漫着的和平气氛。今年五月，我到苏联参加五一节的庆祝盛典的时候，我曾有很多机会去认识这个进行着伟大和平建设的国家。其后在一个月的时间里，我访问了很多城市，包括列宁格勒和高尔基城以及广大的农村。到处都是新盖起来的建筑物，人民的建筑物，工人的住宅区以及为提高苏维埃人民生活水平的各种企业。我和各种人物都谈过话——工人、学生、艺术家、政府干部等等。我常感到他们谈话的主题总是离不开和平建设。战争歇斯底里在苏联是根本不存在的；事实上，在那里，鼓动战争歇斯底里是一种要受到法律制裁的罪行。在社会主义的国土上，和平的事业是凌驾一切的。
    在苏联伟大的和平建设景象中，最值得注意的一个就是将告完成的莫斯科大学的新厦。对于一个坐飞机到这个社会主义国家首都来的旅客，这真是一个瑰丽的景色！很远就可以看见这座突出的摩天楼。而这是一座学习的摩天楼，在这里，热情好学的青年男女将为了提高人民生活水准而提高他们的知识水平。这和纽约的摩天楼是何等的不同！在那儿，今天统治着美国并且妄想控制其他民族的人们，正贪婪地整天追逐着沾满血迹的利润以及其他阴谋的勾当。莫斯科大学有三十六层楼，一百架电梯，以及其他最现代化的新型设备。落成后，它将容纳六千名学生。在这座高等学府里，为学生置备的各种学习条件将是世界上无可匹比的。
    我一生七十八年当中也见过不少世面，但面对这座雄视莫斯科天际的壮丽建筑物，我竟感觉惑然了。倒不是它的体积和外形，而是建筑这所新的学习中心所象征的事物迷惑了我。和苏联所有其他的建设计划一样，它和“备战”没有一丝共通之处。苏维埃政权花费百十亿卢布的巨大建设，像这所莫斯科大学、伏尔加河、第聂伯河与阿姆·达里亚河的水力发电站，以及土库曼大运河等，其规模都是只有坚持和平政策的伟大国家才实行得了的建设计划。这和吹嘘着到一九五二年底将有八百万工人从事战争工业生产的美国，是何其鲜明的一个对照！
    当我伫立在莫斯科大学这所壮观的建筑物之前，默想和它同样巨大的苏联战后建设工程的意义时，我的思潮很自然地回溯到产生了今天这个伟大社会主义国家——一九一七年的十月革命。这一个有着历史动力的事件，奠定了在地球六分之一的土地上建设社会主义国家的基础。为了更好地建设和过渡到共产主义社会，和平的条件是必要的。因此，在过去三十多年间，苏联的外交政策一贯地以“和平”为基石。但资本主义国家的统治者们是不会，也不可能靠和平繁盛起来的。和平会剥夺死亡贩子们所追索的利润。他们不相信社会主义和资本主义制度能够和平共处，因为他们知道在追求和平的道路上，腐朽的资本主义制度是不可能在竞赛中取得胜利的。这就是为什么这些资本家们，虽然饱尝了武装干涉的惨败教训，仍然继续以战争威胁苏联的道理。然而尽管如此，以苏联为首的和平力量却已经成长到了极其壮大的地步。
    苏联不仅在自己国内为和平而进行着建设，它而且确定不移地施行着与其他国家保持和平关系的外交政策，并帮助友好国家的和平建设。我在德意志民主共和国看到了苏联这种伟大国际主义精神的表现。记得在德国有一位企业家曾经告诉我，靠着苏联的援助，德国工业怎样又恢复了起来。和华尔街控制下的鲁尔区不同，这儿没有“卡特尔”的地盘，也没有附加的“政治条件”。苏联给予德国人民以援助，是为了要恢复他们被战争摧毁的工业和满足人民的需要。这又和那些受美国“总督”控制的克鲁伯与阿登纳之流所干的勾当有着何等的不同！
    在华尔街控制下的西德，全部工业都被卷入了军事生产，以供给那些“欧洲军”，“北大西洋联盟军”等的需要。德国青年正在被硬塞在侵略战争的机器中。然而在德意志民主共和国里，人民正利用苏联的援助来生产他们自己所最需用的东西。他们对自己生产出来的物品，没有怀着会被用以毁灭自己或别人的恐惧。德意志民主共和国的人民衷心地拥护着苏联的和平政策，他们正缔造着和平幸福的生活。
    新中国又是一个苏联帮助其他人民和平建设的例子。没有苏联如此大量和不能估价的援助，中国人民是不可能在过去两年间得到这么杰出的成就的。苏联对新中国的援助是在真正的国际主义精神下给予的。这表现在很多地方。我特别记得高尔基城的一个工人紧握着我手的热情，那是我从来没感受过的。那时尽管他的话我一个字都不懂，但我能从他的微笑里，了解到中国与苏联的人民的友谊是如何之深。后来一位翻译员告诉我他说的是：“中国真福气，现在人民有了毛泽东！”在我们居留苏联的期间里，曾有过很多类似的经验；人们特意从远道前来表示他们温暖深厚的友情。就是这种苏联人民对新中国的伟大友谊，蜕变今天正以不可估量的具体援助帮助着我们建设一个新民主主义的社会！
    但是，实际上，新中国从苏联人民所得的援助比造成它目前杰出成就的援助要多得多。中华民族的再生，是苏联十月革命成功所产生的直接影响之一。当我第一次看到那被革命党人攻取下来，象征着十月革命胜利的列宁格勒的“冬宫”，与炮击“冬宫”的“阿芙乐尔”军舰时，我不禁想到了毛主席的话：
    “在十月革命以前，中国人不但不知道列宁，斯大林，也不知道马克思，恩格斯。十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。十月革命帮助了全世界的也帮助了中国的先进分子，用无产阶级的宇宙观作为观察国家命运的工具，重新考虑自己的问题。走俄国人的路——这就是结论。”
    中国人民在共产党的领导下，是走上了这条道路，从而替亚洲带来了强大的中华人民共和国。如果不是吸取十月革命的教训——用马列主义无产阶级的宇宙观作为观察国家命运的工具——中国人民是不会得到胜利，不会把四亿七千五百万人民带到已经强大的、以苏联为首的国际和平阵营里来的。
    中华人民共和国的出现，有力地改变了力量的对比，使其大大地有利于和平阵营。中苏友好同盟互助条约所标志着的中苏两国人民的联盟使得以苏联为首的和平民主与社会主义的阵营，变得更加坚强与无敌。导源于伟大十月社会主义革命的两国人民的友谊，将会使世界安全地度过战争贩子们所筹谋的一切危机，最后使全世界进入人民的和平民主纪元。
