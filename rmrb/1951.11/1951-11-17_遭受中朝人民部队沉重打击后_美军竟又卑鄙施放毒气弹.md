　　Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 16th. Ignoring international law, the American invading army has shamelessly used gas bombs on the Korean front once again. On October 15th, the American invading army launched an attack on the Shangganling area northeast of Jinhua. After suffering a heavy blow from a certain unit of our army, they fired four gas bombs at our forward positions at 3:00 PM. On the 17th, they fired another gas bomb at our positions in the afternoon. The aforementioned gas bombs made very little sound upon explosion, and released a white gas after exploding. Those who were poisoned experienced eye pain and tearing, increased body temperature, accelerated pulse, difficulty breathing, headaches, vomiting, and even unconsciousness.

　　On the morning of November 4th, at 4:00 AM, during the battle of our army's counterattack against Height 281.1 near Xidong, north of Tieyuan, the enemy also released multiple gas bombs.

　　The American invaders' shameless crime of repeatedly using gas bombs has aroused great anger among the commanders and fighters of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. They vow to fight more bravely to retaliate against the despicable invaders.

　　遭受中朝人民部队沉重打击后
    美军竟又卑鄙施放毒气弹
    【新华社朝鲜前线十六日电】不顾国际公法的美国侵略军，无耻地又一次在朝鲜前线施放毒气弹。十月十五日，美国侵略军向金化东北上甘岭一带进犯，在遭受我军某部沉重打击后，于下午三时向我前沿阵地放射毒气弹四枚，十七日下午又向我阵地发射毒气弹一枚。上述毒气弹爆炸声甚微，爆炸后放出白色气体。中毒者眼痛流泪，体温增高，脉搏跳动转快，呼吸困难，头痛呕吐以至晕迷不醒。
    十一月四日晨四时，在我军反击铁原以北方西洞附近二八一点一高地的战斗中，敌军亦曾施放毒气弹多枚。
    美国侵略者屡次施放毒气弹的无耻罪行，激起朝鲜人民军、中国人民志愿军指挥员战斗员们极大的愤怒。他们誓以更英勇的战斗，来回击卑鄙透顶的侵略者。
