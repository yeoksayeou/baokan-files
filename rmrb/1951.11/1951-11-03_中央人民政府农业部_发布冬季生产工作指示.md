The general task of agricultural production in 1952 is to vigorously develop the patriotic production increase movement on the basis of this year's agricultural production, so as to increase the yield per unit area and strive to restore or exceed the pre-war level of agricultural production throughout the country in 1952. This winter, agricultural leading organs in various regions should, in accordance with specific conditions, vigorously organize manpower and materials to do the following tasks well to prepare for next year's bumper harvest movement.

	(1) All winter fallow land must be deeply ploughed and finely cultivated, and must be completed before freezing. Experience has proven that winter ploughing is a necessary measure to maintain soil moisture (preserve moisture), cultivate fertility, and prevent and control pests. At the same time, attention should be paid to burning stubble and rice roots where pests are hiding during winter ploughing, removing weeds that harbor pests in the fields, and advocating irrigating rice fields with winter water after ploughing to fundamentally eliminate pests.

	(2) Vigorously launch a manure accumulation campaign. Increase fertilizer application, mainly with farmers' own soil manure, supplemented by purchasing and transporting commercial fertilizers. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously promote household construction of thatched toilets, digging manure pits, and using soil as bedding in cattle sheds; calling on every household to raise pigs and build pig pens; raising flocks of "doorstep sheep" in mountainous areas (i.e., each household raises sheep and grazes them collectively); organizing urban manure to go to the countryside, digging river mud, pond mud, and lake mud; planting more green manure in some areas of the south; organizing the masses to use all manure accumulation methods suitable to local conditions to greatly increase manure accumulation. And assist cooperative trade departments to restore rural oil mills to increase oil cake production.

	(3) Strengthen various drought and flood prevention measures. Use all ditches, canals and wells to organize the masses to irrigate winter water. In the south, repairing ponds and dams should start as early as possible, and strive to expand the storage capacity. In the north, prepare for the necessary materials such as bricks and wood for next year's work of drilling wells, repairing canals, and promoting waterwheels. In waterlogged areas, organize the masses to dredge channels in a planned way to drain water and free the land; in mountainous areas, vigorously repair terraced fields to prevent flood erosion.

	(4) Vigorously increase farm tools, purchase and transport livestock, prepare pesticides and machinery, and properly protect seeds, to make strong preparations for increasing yield per unit area and striving for a bumper harvest next year. Livestock areas should vigorously promote grass harvesting and call on the masses to pay attention to winter livestock feeding management.

	(5) In order to increase the yield per unit area, it is necessary to seize the winter slack season to carry out ideological, organizational, and technical preparations. First, various localities should, according to needs, hold various professional technical training classes, hold labor model conferences, summarize typical experiences, and train agricultural work cadres, labor models, and production activists. Villages can hold technical seminars; counties and districts can hold agricultural technology conferences with farms as the main body. Second, various localities should conduct patriotic production increase education in rural winter schools, publicize the prospects for agricultural development in the new democratic society, and incorporate the most essential local production technology knowledge into winter school teaching materials. Third, agricultural mutual aid and cooperation organizations in various localities have developed in the past year or two. This winter, in areas where conditions permit, agricultural mutual aid and cooperation representative conferences should be held in a planned way by county and district units, and mutual aid and cooperation seminars should be held in villages to exchange and summarize experiences, and train mutual aid team leaders and agricultural production cooperative chairmen, in order to achieve steady development and improvement, and reorganize existing mutual aid organizations.

Developing rural sideline production and organizing the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas are effective ways to increase farmers' income and accumulate agricultural production investment. Especially in disaster areas and mountainous areas, it is necessary to use loans in a planned and focused way to organize farmers to do a good job in sideline and transportation production, and prepare seeds for spring crops and mountain fruits. This is a major issue related to whether disaster areas and mountainous areas have the strength to carry out agricultural production next year. The leading organs in disaster-stricken areas and mountainous areas must pay serious attention to this issue.

The production increase task for next year is arduous. In order to make it fully possible to complete this task, various localities should, according to the above opinions and local conditions, formulate practical and specific winter production plans, arrange them as early as possible, and constantly check and promote them. If necessary, conduct some rural surveys to grasp the specific situation and create favorable conditions for next year's bumper harvest movement.

    中央人民政府农业部
    发布冬季生产工作指示
    在今年农业生产的基础上，大力开展爱国丰产运动，以提高单位面积产量，争取一九五二年全国范围内农业生产恢复到或者超过战前水平，是一九五二年农业生产的总任务。今年冬季，各地农业领导机关应依照具体情况，大力组织人力、物力，做好下列各项工作，为明年丰产运动作好准备工作。
    （一）冬季休闲的田地，一律实行深耕细耕，务须在封冻以前全部完成。经验证明，冬耕是保持土壤水分（保墒）、培养地力和防除虫害的必要措施。同时，在冬耕中应注意焚毁害虫潜伏的谷茬稻根，清除田间害虫所寄生的杂草，提倡水稻田在翻耕后灌浇冬水，从根本上着手消除虫害。
    （二）大力开展积肥运动。增施肥料，以农民自积土粪为主，购运商品肥料为辅。因此必须大力提倡家家修茅厕，挖粪坑，牛棚垫土；号召家家养猪，搭猪圈；山区大量养门头羊（即每家养羊，合伙放牧）；组织城粪下乡，挖河泥、塘泥、湖泥；南方部分地区多种绿肥；组织群众利用一切适合当地具体情况的积肥办法，大量增积肥料。并协助合作贸易部门恢复农村油坊，以增加油饼生产。
    （三）加强防旱防涝的各项措施。利用一切沟渠水井，组织群众浇灌冬水。南方修整塘坝应及早动手，力求扩大蓄水量。北方筹运砖木器材等，为明年打井、修渠、推广水车等工作进行必要的准备。积水地区应组织群众有计划地疏浚渠道，排水脱地；山区应大力修整梯田，以防洪水冲刷。
    （四）大力增补农具，购运牲畜，准备杀虫药械，妥为保护籽种，给明年提高单位面积产量、争取丰收，作好有力准备。畜牧地区大力提倡打草，号召群众注意冬季牲畜饲养管理。
    （五）为了提高单位面积产量，必须抓紧冬闲季节，进行思想上、组织上、技术上的准备工作。首先，各地应根据需要，举办各种专业技术训练班，开好劳动模范会议，总结典型经验，训练农业工作干部、劳动模范和生产积极分子。村可以召开技术座谈会；县、区可以以农场为主体召开农业技术会议。其次，各地在农村冬学中应进行爱国丰产教育，宣传新民主主义社会农业发展的前途，并把当地最切要的生产技术常识编入冬学教材。第三，一两年来各地农业生产互助合作组织均有发展，今冬在条件具备的地区，应有计划地以县、区为单位召开农业互助合作代表会议，村要召开互助合作座谈会，以交流和总结经验，训练互助组长、农业生产合作社社长，以求稳步的发展与提高，把现有互助组织加以整理。
    开展农村副业生产，组织城乡物资交流，是增加农民收入、积累农业生产投资的有效办法。特别是灾区和山区，更须有计划有重点地使用贷款，组织农民作好副业和运输生产，并准备好春作与山果水果的种子。这是关系灾区与山区明年有无力量进行农业生产的重大问题，受灾地区与山区的领导机关，必须严重注意这一问题。
    明年的增产任务是艰巨的，为了使这一任务有充分完成的可能，各地应根据上述意见与当地条件，定出切实具体的冬季生产计划，及早布置，并不断检查推动，必要时进行一些农村调查工作，掌握具体情况，为明年的丰产运动创设有利的条件。
