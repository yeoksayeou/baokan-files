After Reasonable Wage Adjustments at Beijing Liulihe Cement Plant, Morale of All Employees Improves, Continuously Setting New Records

Editor's Note: The experience of the Beijing Liulihe Cement Plant proves that all factories and mines that have not yet begun to reform the wage system must pay attention to changing unreasonable wage systems in a timely manner and implementing the eight-grade wage system as production develops. This is an important step to meet the demands of the majority of workers and continue to increase production enthusiasm.

After adjusting wages in October, the Liulihe Cement Plant saw a surge in the work enthusiasm of all employees, and production greatly increased. In October, all employees of the plant exceeded the original production target by 8.6%. The workers in the calcination workshop created 17 new records in a row.

After the wage adjustment, the vast majority of employees received wage increases. Many workers bought several bags of flour, and some bought entire bolts of cloth to sew new cotton-padded clothes for their entire families.

After the wage assessment, veteran worker Fang Shichang said to Xia Shouqing, the party branch secretary, "Lao Xia, Chairman Mao cares about us so much, I must put all my effort into working." The workers transformed their gratitude to Chairman Mao into positive actions. The workers in the repair shop overhauled No. 3 kiln, which was originally scheduled to take ten days, but they completed it in only nine days. The large toothed ring of the coal mill in the factory broke. In the past, it would have cost 180 million yuan to buy one from outside. This time, after careful research by the workers in the repair shop, they recast one themselves, spending only 130 million yuan. Two kilns in the factory had "ring formation" (cement solidified into a ring shape in the kiln, hindering cement production). It usually takes nine hours to break these two kiln rings. Workers Zhu Deyong and others braved high temperatures to enter the kiln to break the rings, taking only three hours. The production performance of all workshops in the plant consistently rose in October, and the output of each rotary kiln and mill set new records. The rotary kiln has already exceeded one-tenth of the highest output during the Japanese puppet regime.

Due to the implementation of the eight-grade wage system, the workers further realized that only by improving their skills can they increase the income of the country and themselves, thereby increasing their enthusiasm for learning skills. Many workers bought the "Mechanical Worker" magazine, and those who could not read asked others to read it to them. Worker Xu Yanxing used to work carelessly, unwilling to delve into technology and afraid of hardship. When overhauling the rotary kiln, he did not enter the kiln, but only passed bricks at the kiln mouth. During the wage assessment, he realized that he could no longer muddle along like this. Now he bought a meter ruler and recorded the dimensions of the machine. When repairing the kiln, he also strives to enter the kiln, asking questions when he doesn't understand, showing a high degree of enthusiasm for learning.

In mid-October, the entire plant conducted a major safety inspection, and the workers participated in this work with great enthusiasm. The workers of the entire plant submitted a total of 3,007 proposals, and they solved 744 of them themselves. In this major safety inspection, through the active research of the workers, the serious dust problem of the cement plant was overcome. Previously, in the raw material, crushing, and packaging departments, dust reduced the light to only three feet, and even the stairs could not be seen clearly. The workers wore masks, but it was still not effective; they still coughed up black phlegm for three days after work. Now, by adopting dust blocking and dust prevention measures, the workshops are much cleaner, and some workshops are so clean that masks are no longer needed.

### 北京琉璃河水泥厂合理调整工资后  全体职工生产情绪提高连创新纪录

    北京琉璃河水泥厂合理调整工资后
    全体职工生产情绪提高连创新纪录
    编者按：北京琉璃河水泥厂的经验证明：一切尚未着手改革工资制度的厂矿随着生产的发展，必须注意及时改变不合理的工资制度，实行八级工资制。这是满足广大工人要求，继续提高生产热情重要环节之一。
    琉璃河水泥厂在十月份调整了工资后，全体职工劳动情绪高涨，生产大大提高。十月份全厂职工超额完成了原订生产任务的百分之八点六。烧成车间职工一连创造了十七次新纪录。
    调整工资后，绝大部分职工都增加了工资。许多工人买了好几袋面粉，有些工人买了整匹的布，替全家人都缝上新棉衣。
    老工人方世昌在评定工资后，对党的总支书记夏绶卿同志说：“老夏，毛主席这样关心我们，我一定要拿出所有的力量来干活。”工人们把感激毛主席的心情变成了积极的行动。修理厂工人检修三号窑，原订十天完成，结果只用了九天。厂里的煤磨大牙轮坏了，过去在外边买，要用一亿八千万元，这次经过修理厂职工精心研究，自己翻砂重做了一个，只花了一亿三千万元。厂里有两个窑结圈了（水泥在窑里凝结成圈状，妨碍水泥生产），要打掉这两个窑的结圈，平常需要九小时。工人朱德永等冒着高温钻进窑内打结圈，只用了三小时。全厂各个车间的生产成绩，在十月份始终直线上升，各个旋窑、磨子的产量都创造了新纪录。旋窑已经超过日伪统治时期最高产量的十分之一。
    由于实行了八级工资制，使工人们进一步认识到只有提高技术，才能增加国家和自己的收入，因而提高了学习技术的热情。许多工人买了“机械工人”杂志，不认得字的就请别人讲给他听。工人许衍兴，过去干活吊儿郎当，不愿钻研技术，怕吃苦，检修旋窑时，不进窑里，只在窑口递砖。在评定工资等级的时候，才觉得再这样瞎胡混可不行了。现在他买了一根米达尺，把机器的尺寸都记下了，修窑时，也争着进窑里去，不懂就问，学习热情很高。
    十月中旬，全厂进行了保安大检查，工人们又以高度的热情，参加了这一工作。全厂工人共提出提案三千零七件，自己动手解决的占七百四十四件。在这次保安大检查中，经过工人们的积极钻研，克服了水泥厂严重的灰尘问题。以前在原料、粉碎、包装等部门，灰尘使灯光照明不到三尺，连楼梯都看不清楚；工人戴了口罩也不顶事，歇工后三天还吐黑痰。现在采用堵灰防尘的办法，车间里已经干净多了，有些车间清洁得连口罩都用不着了。
