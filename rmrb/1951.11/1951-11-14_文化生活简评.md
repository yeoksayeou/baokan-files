　　Cultural Life Brief Reviews

　　"Wenyi Bao" (Literary Gazette) Publishes a Batch of Valuable Reader Letters
　　"Wenyi Bao," Volume 5, Issue 2, prominently published six letters concerning the same issue. This issue is: Some teachers in Chinese Literature Departments of universities and Chinese Language Departments of teachers' colleges have serious deviations from reality in their teaching. Some teachers hold a contemptuous attitude towards people's literature and art. When teaching the course of literary theory, they rarely mention Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," only briefly mentioning it in the last chapter. However, they arbitrarily criticize today's popularization of people's literature and art as "popularizationism" and negate it. Some believe that "Korean War Correspondence" is not worth analyzing, and say that discussing "The Life of Wu Xun" is "following the trend." Some teachers only know how to use "Hamlet" and "Oblomov" as teaching examples. When students ask for Chinese examples, they express dissatisfaction. Some teachers do not criticize or guide students' compositions that contain strong petty-bourgeois ideas, but instead praise them and recite their own old works that resonate with these compositions in class. Some teachers unilaterally emphasize skills. Some teachers still use outdated views to teach, believing that literary thought presents a wave-like development trend according to the alternation of idealism and materialism. There are many other erroneous ideas that cannot be listed one by one.

　　These situations reflect that some teachers engaged in literary teaching in our universities indeed have erroneous literary ideas, and they continue to maintain their past teaching methods that are divorced from reality. This deserves serious attention. Chairman Mao pointed out the importance of widely carrying out self-education and self-transformation movements among the cultural and educational front and various intellectuals in China at the opening session of the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. He said: "Ideological remolding, first of all the ideological remolding of various intellectuals, is one of the important conditions for our country to thoroughly realize democratic reforms in all aspects and gradually implement industrialization." Recently, teachers in universities in Beijing and Tianjin are conducting a study movement led by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government with the aim of transforming their thoughts. This movement will also be extended to the whole country. The reader letters published in "Wenyi Bao" prove that such a ideological remolding learning movement is also very necessary among university teachers teaching literary theory. Teachers of literature departments in universities in Beijing, Tianjin, and even across the country should pay close attention to this issue, and under the unified leadership of the Ministry of Education, conduct in-depth discussions based on the specific situation and existing problems of each school, analyze and criticize erroneous teaching ideas and methods, so as to implement Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong's literary thought in the future teaching of university literary theory, and eliminate bourgeois and formalist literary theories and dogmatic teaching methods.

　　Correctly Carry Out Ideological Struggle in the Education Sector
　　The discussion and criticism of Wu Xun and the film "The Life of Wu Xun" has initially clarified the chaotic thinking on the Wu Xun issue in China's education sector. But it must be pointed out that in the current education sector, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas still occupy a certain position, some of which even carry strong comprador ideas (especially the idea of ​​worshiping British and American bourgeoisie) and feudal ideas. This seriously hinders our reform of the old cultural and educational undertakings. Therefore, correctly carrying out the ideological struggle in the education sector is imperative today. Since Volume 2, Issue 6, "Renmin Jiaoyu" (People's Education) has continuously criticized Chen Heqin's "living education" theory, which was the first to experiment with Dewey's theory in China. This is very necessary. Secondly, regarding the issue of understanding Mr. Tao Xingzhi's educational thought, "Renmin Jiaoyu" has also started a preliminary self-criticism and review by several people in charge of the "Life Education Society" since Volume 3, Issue 6. There is no doubt that Mr. Tao Xingzhi became a close comrade-in-arms of the Chinese Communist Party in the democratic movement. We respect this democratic fighter; however, Mr. Tao Xingzhi's educational thought belongs to the category of petty-bourgeois reformism, and it is completely two different educational thought systems from the proletarian educational thought. Our discussion and criticism of Mr. Tao Xingzhi's educational thought will never obliterate the glorious side of Mr. Tao Xingzhi, and such criticism is beneficial to the people's education cause. However, this discussion and criticism work has only just begun and needs to be continued in depth. We hope that educators will pay attention to this issue, clarify certain erroneous ideas, and better serve the people's education cause.

　　Mobilize Intellectual Housewives to Participate in Teaching
　　Solving the problem of teachers is a central link in future education work. In order to meet the country's large and urgent needs, one million people's teachers must be trained in the next five years. This is a serious political task. To accomplish this task, we cannot unilaterally emphasize formal normal education, but must focus on short-term training to cultivate a large number of educators. One of the sources of teachers is the vast number of intellectual housewives. After the literacy campaign in Lingqian District, Dalian City, the Cultural and Educational Section of the District People's Government first conducted a survey of intellectual housewives in the district (with an educational level of junior high school or above); and visited households to conduct publicity and education, mobilizing 42 women to participate in the teaching of the cultural popularization movement (cultural supplementary schools) from more than 180 intellectual housewives in the district, solving part of the teacher problem. This approach is completely correct. Most of these women are family members of university teachers, technicians, and staff members. They all have a cultural level of junior high school or above, but because they have been at home for a long time, most of what they have learned in the past has been forgotten, and their political awareness is also relatively low; but after short-term training, they have initially established the idea of serving the people and want to use their strength to work hard for the construction of our great motherland. The experience of the Cultural and Educational Section of the Lingqian District People's Government of Dalian City in actively mobilizing intellectual housewives to participate in teaching is worth learning from all over the country. There are many intellectual housewives in large, medium, and small cities. We should give full play to their strength in order to quickly cultivate more people's teachers.

专栏：文化生活简评

    文化生活简评
　　“文艺报”发表了一批有价值的读者来信
    “文艺报”五卷二期以显著的地位，刊载了六封关于同一问题的来信。这个问题是：某些大学中国文学系和师范学院国文系的教师们，在教学中严重地存在着脱离实际的偏向。有的教师对于人民文艺抱着轻视态度，他们在讲授文艺学这一门课程时，极少提到毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”，只在讲授最后一章时简略地提到，但却又把今天的人民文艺的普及工作胡乱地评为“普及主义”，而加以否定。有的认为“朝鲜通讯”不值得分析，说讨论“武训传”是“赶时髦”。有的教师只知道用“哈姆雷特”、“奥勃洛摩夫”作教学例证，学生提出要求举些中国的例子时，他们就表示不满。有的教师对于含有浓厚的小资产阶级思想的学生习作，不加批评教导，反而加以表扬，并在课堂上朗诵与这些习作共鸣的自己的旧作。有的教师片面强调技巧。有的教师还在用陈腐的观点来教学，认为文艺思想是按着唯心主义、唯物主义的互相交替，而呈现波浪式的发展趋势。还有许多错误的思想，不能一一列举。
    这些情况反映了在我们高等学校中，一部分担任文艺教学的教师确实具有错误的文艺思想，他们还继续保持着自己过去的脱离实际的教学方法，这是值得严重注意的。毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议的开会词中曾指出在我国的文化教育战线和各种知识分子中广泛地开展自我教育和自我改造运动的重要性。他说：“思想改造，首先是各种知识分子的思想改造，是我国在各方面彻底实现民主改革和逐步实行工业化的重要条件之一。”最近，北京、天津各高等学校的教师，正在中央人民政府教育部领导下进行以改造思想为目的的学习运动。这一运动并将推广到全国。“文艺报”所刊登的这些读者来信，证明了这样的思想改造的学习运动在讲授文艺学的高等学校教师中间，也是十分需要的。北京、天津以至全国各高等学校的文学系教师，应该对这一问题，加以密切的注意，并在教育部的统一领导下根据各校具体情况和存在的问题展开深入的讨论，对错误的教学思想和方法，加以分析和批判，以便在今后的大学文学理论的教学中，贯彻马克思、列宁主义和毛泽东的文艺思想，肃清资产阶级的、形式主义的文艺理论和教条主义的教学方法。
    正确地开展教育界的思想斗争
    对于武训和电影“武训传”的讨论和批评，使我国教育界在武训问题上的混乱思想获得了初步的澄清。但必须指出：在目前的教育界中，资产阶级的和小资产阶级的思想还占着一定的地位，其中的一部分，甚至是带有浓厚的买办思想（特别是崇拜英美资产阶级的思想）和封建思想。这就严重地妨害了我们对于旧有的文化教育事业的改革。因此，正确地开展教育界的思想斗争，在今天来说，是迫不容缓的。“人民教育”从第二卷第六期以来，对于在中国最先实验杜威学说的陈鹤琴的“活教育”理论连续进行了批评，这是非常必要的。其次是关于陶行知先生的教育思想认识问题，“人民教育”自第三卷第六期起，也由过去“生活教育社”的几位负责人开始，进行了初步的自我批评与检讨。陶行知先生成为中国共产党在民主运动中的亲密战友，这是没有任何疑问的，我们尊敬这位民主战士；但陶行知先生的教育思想，是属于小资产阶级的改良主义范畴的，它和无产阶级的教育思想完全是两种不同的教育思想体系。我们对陶行知先生的教育思想进行讨论和批判，决不抹杀陶行知先生光辉的一面，这样的批判是对于人民的教育事业有益的。但，这一讨论和批判工作还只在开始，尚有待于继续深入下去。我们希望教育工作者重视这个问题，澄清某些错误思想，更好地为人民教育事业服务。
    动员家庭知识妇女参加教学工作
    解决师资问题是今后教育工作中的中心环节。为了适应国家大量和迫切的需要，今后五年内要培养出百万人民教师来。这是一个严重的政治任务。要完成这一任务，我们不能片面地强调正规师范教育，必须以短期训练为重点，培养大批的教育工作者。师资来源之一，便是广大的家庭知识妇女。旅大市岭前区人民政府文教科，在该区识字运动结束后，首先做了一次家庭知识妇女的调查（初中以上文化程度的）；并挨户访问，进行宣传教育，从全区一百八十多名家庭知识妇女当中，先后动员了四十二名妇女参加文化普及运动的教学（文化补习学校）工作，解决了部分师资问题。这种做法是完全正确的。这些妇女，大部分是大学教师、技术人员和职员的家属。她们都具有初中以上的文化程度，但由于长期在家里，把过去学过的东西多半都忘掉了，政治觉悟也比较低；可是经过短期的训练之后，她们都初步树立了为人民服务的思想，要把自己的力量拿出来，为建设我们伟大的祖国而努力。旅大市岭前区人民政府文教科这种积极发动家庭知识妇女参加教学工作的经验，是值得各地学习的。在各大、中、小城市中，家庭知识妇女很多，我们应该充分发挥她们的力量，以便迅速培养出更多的人民教师来。
