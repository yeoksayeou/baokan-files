The Ma Liu-hai Tunneling Team of Datong Coal Mine has created advanced experience in improving tunneling efficiency, solving a difficult problem for the promotion of new coal mining methods. In the operation of roadways 2 meters high and 3 meters wide, the Ma Liu-hai team has created the highest record in the mine's tunneling work for three consecutive times this year. They tunneled 187 meters in May, 318 meters in June, and 479 meters in September.

Since the successful trial of new coal mining methods in August last year, the work efficiency of the Datong Coal Mine's mining fields has been greatly improved. However, due to the low efficiency of roadway tunneling, the opening of new mining fields cannot meet the requirements of coal mining work. In order to solve this problem, the Ma Liu-hai team took the lead in adopting the "multi-hole tunneling cyclical operation method" in the Datong Coal Mine. The advantage of this operation method is that it avoids the shortcomings of wasting man-hours in single-hole tunneling, thus greatly improving tunneling efficiency. In the past, when tunneling workers tunneled in one roadway, after each blasting, they had to wait for the smoke to dissipate, the porters had to carry out the collapsed coal, and the working face had to be cleaned before they could continue tunneling. Now it is different to implement the "multi-hole tunneling cyclical operation method." Each shift of tunneling workers opens a parallel ventilation roadway (8 to 10 meters apart) while excavating the main roadway, and opens a cross roadway every 20 to 30 meters to facilitate ventilation. Therefore, after the tunneling workers have blasted in roadway A, they can go to roadway B to work without waiting. In this way, tunneling efficiency can generally be increased by about one time.

Since the beginning of this year, several mines in various places have tried the multi-hole tunneling cyclical operation method, but the effect is not as significant as that of the Ma Liu-hai team. The Ma Liu-hai team's multi-hole cyclical operation is good, first of all because they solved the problem of reasonable organization of labor.

The Datong Coal Mine is in continuous production for three shifts day and night. In the past, the three shifts were each a group, without unified leadership. In mid-May, the Ma Liu-hai team and two other groups formed a "round shift," with Ma Liu-hai serving as the group leader. In order to prevent the work of the upper shift from affecting the work of the lower shift, they established a shift handover system, stipulating that the upper shift should leave a cleaned working face and five electric drills for the lower shift. The Ma Liu-hai team has a total of three people, and each person's work has clear regulations. When taking over the shift, one of the three people handles the shift handover procedures, checks the water lines, electric drills and roadway specifications, one person prepares gunpowder and stemming, and the other person sharpens the drill bits. When the shift handover procedures are cleared, the person preparing gunpowder and stemming also arrives, and the two people work together to drill holes (at this time, the porters are pushing coal in another roadway). When the person sharpening the drill bits returns to the roadway, the three people jointly bore and load the explosives. When the explosives are loaded, another roadway has also been cleaned out, and the two people who originally drilled holes switch to another roadway to drill holes, and the person left behind detonates the explosives in this roadway, and the porters switch to work in this roadway. Due to such meticulous organization of labor, production gaps are reduced to a minimum, and tunneling work efficiency is greatly improved.

After the labor organization in the tunneling work was improved, the Ma Liu-hai team further closely cooperated with the porters. The Ma Liu-hai team paid great attention to carrying out solidarity education among the porters. They said to the porters: "Completing the tunneling task is the glory of all the tunneling workers and porters." They signed a contact contract with the porters, the tunneling workers guaranteed that the porters would have coal to push, and the porters guaranteed that the roadway would not accumulate coal. After these efforts, the Ma Liu-hai team no longer experienced the phenomenon of tunneling being affected because coal could not be transported out.

The continuous improvement of the Ma Liu-hai team's tunneling efficiency is also due to their constant attention to learning and improving technology. They established a technical brainstorming meeting system. Before each shift handover, they used about ten minutes to jointly study with the technicians the quality of the upper shift workers' drilling and blasting. In May and June, they tested seven or eight methods of drilling and blasting. As a result of such research and testing, the time for one drilling and blasting was reduced from about one hour to 25 to 30 minutes, and the progress was increased from 70 to 80 centimeters to 1.08 meters to 1.10 meters.

　　大同煤矿马六孩小组
    创造提高掘进率的先进经验
    国营大同煤矿马六孩掘进小组创造了提高掘进效率的先进经验，为推广新采煤法解决了一个困难问题。马六孩小组在进行二公尺高三公尺宽的巷道作业中，今年已连续三次创造了全矿掘进工作的最高纪录。计五月份掘进了一百八十七公尺，六月份掘进了三百十八公尺，九月份掘进了四百七十九公尺。
    大同煤矿自去年八月试行新采煤方法成功后，采煤场工作效率已大大提高。但是因为巷道掘进效率低，新采煤场子的开辟不能适应采煤工作的要求。为了解决这一问题，马六孩小组在大同煤矿首先采用了“多孔道掘进循环作业法”。这个作业法的好处是避免了单孔道掘进时浪费工时的缺点，因而大大提高了掘进效率。过去掘进工人在一个巷道中掘进，每放完一遍炮之后，必须等到硝烟消散，搬运工人将崩下来的煤运出去，清理了工作面，才能继续掘进。现在实行“多孔道掘进循环作业法”就不同了。每班掘进工人在开凿正巷的同时，又开凿一个平行通风巷（两巷相距八至十公尺），并每进二、三十公尺再开一横巷以利通风。因此掘进工在甲巷放完一遍炮之后，就可到乙巷工作，不必等待。这样，掘进效率一般可以提高一倍左右。
    今年以来，各地已有若干矿山试行了多孔道掘进循环作业法，但是效果没有马六孩小组显著。马六孩小组多孔道循环作业做得好，首先是因为他们解决了一个劳动力的合理组织问题。
    大同煤矿是日夜三班连续生产的。过去三班各是一组，没有统一领导。五月中马六孩小组和另外两组组成了一个“圆班”，马六孩担任大组长。他们为了不使上班影响下班的工作，就订立了交接班制度，规定上班要给下班留下一个清理好的工作面，五根电钻子。马六孩小组一共三个人，各人的工作都有明确的规定。接班时，三人中一人办理交接班手续，检查水线、电钻和巷道规格，一人准备炮药、炮土，另一人磨钎子。交接班的手续办理清楚时，准备炮药、炮土的人也来了，这两人便一同打眼（此时搬运工就在另一巷道推煤）。当磨钎子的回到巷道后，三人便共同掏眼装炮。炮装好时另一巷道也已清理出来，原先打眼的两个人便转入另一巷道打眼，留下的一个人便在这一巷道放炮，搬运工人便转来这一巷道工作。由于这样细致地组织了劳动力，生产间隙就减少到最少限度，掘进工作效率因而大大提高。
    在掘进工作的劳动组织改进以后，马六孩小组又进一步和搬运工密切配合。马六孩小组十分注意在搬运工人中进行团结教育工作。他们对搬运工人说：“完成掘进任务是掘进工和搬运工全体的光荣。”他们和搬运工订立了联系合同，掘进工保证搬运工有煤推，搬运工保证巷道不积煤。经过这些努力，马六孩小组便不再发生因煤运不出而影响掘进的现象了。
    马六孩小组掘进效率能够不断提高，也由于他们经常注意学习和提高技术。他们建立了技术碰头会的制度。每次交接班以前，他们利用十分钟左右的时间和技术员共同研究上班工人打眼放炮的好坏。在五、六两个月中，他们共试验了七、八种打眼放炮的办法。这样研究、试验的结果，打眼放炮一次的时间便由一小时左右降低到二十五至三十分钟，进度由七、八十公分提高到一公尺零八公分至一公尺十公分。（新华社）
