　　Reducing Transfer Procedures to Save National Expenditure
　　Henan Implements One-Time Warehousing of Trade Grain
　　The Henan Provincial Company of the China National Grain Corporation and the Henan Provincial Grain Bureau, in close contact with local governments, implemented a one-time warehousing method for trade grain, saving manpower, materials, and financial resources involved in grain transfer, shortening the time for grain to enter warehouses, and saving the state over 6.2 billion yuan in expenses.
　　Previously, state-owned grain companies at all levels in Central and South China received trade grain allocated by the financial departments by first having the grain bureau collect the grain into warehouses and then allocate it to the grain company. This transfer procedure increased a significant amount of handling fees and grain loss. To save manpower and financial resources, the Central and South China Regional Company of the China National Grain Corporation consulted with the Central and South China Grain Bureau this year when allocating trade grain and decided to implement a one-time warehousing method, with the grain company directly receiving grain from farmers. To implement this scientific method, the grain company, the grain bureau, and the local administrative organs implemented a strict division of labor and signed agreements and contracts at each level. The provincial grain company and the grain bureau signed an agreement, instructing all branches to conscientiously implement the agreement; all handover points signed handover contracts; the grain bureau and the grain company also signed grain delivery contracts with relevant district and township governments, and separately signed transportation contracts with transportation departments. These agreements and contracts ensured consistent work pace, enabling the grain collection task to be completed on schedule and victoriously. To leverage the role of unified leadership, the province established a transportation headquarters, the special districts set up grain transport command posts, and each grain receiving point established a warehousing committee, with administrative heads in charge and cadres jointly dispatched by the grain bureau and the grain company to work together. As a result of doing this, national financial expenditure was greatly saved. The manpower, materials, and financial resources of both parties involved in the transfer were reduced by more than half compared to last year; the warehousing time was shortened, and work efficiency was improved. Last year, receiving the same amount of grain took half a year to complete, but this year, the task was basically completed in less than a month.

　　减少交接手续节省国家开支
    河南实行贸易粮一次入库
    中国粮食公司河南省公司、河南省粮食管理局与地方政府密切联系，实行贸易粮一次入库办法，节省了交接粮食的人力、物力、财力，缩短了粮食入仓时间，为国家节省开支六十二亿多元。
    中南各级国营粮食公司以前接收财政部门拨交的贸易粮，是先由粮食局把粮食征收入库，然后拨给粮食公司。经过这一次交接手续，增加了大量的搬运费和粮食损耗。为了节省人力、财力，今年拨交贸易粮时，中国粮食公司中南区公司与中南粮食管理局协商，决定实行一次入仓办法，由粮食公司直接向农民接收粮食。为了实行这一科学方法，粮食公司、粮食局与当地行政机关实行了严密的分工，并逐级订立了协议与合同。省粮食公司与粮食局订好协议，指示各分支机构，切实执行协议；各交接点订立了交接合同；粮食局、粮食公司又与有关区、乡政府订立交粮合同，并和运输部门分别订立运输合同。这些协议和合同，保证了工作步调一致，使收粮任务能如期胜利完成。为了发挥统一领导的作用，省成立运输司令部，专区设运粮指挥部，各接粮点成立入仓委员会，由行政首长负责，粮食局和粮食公司各派干部联合办公。这样做的结果，就大大地节省了国家财政的开支。交接双方的人力、物力、财力，较去年节省了一半以上；缩短了入仓时间，提高了工作效率。去年接收相同数量的粮食，半年时间还不能全部结束，今年不到一个月的时间，基本上完成了任务。
