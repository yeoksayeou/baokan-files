    I Have a New Understanding of the Construction of New Inner Mongolia and My Work

    I was originally a student in the Department of Plant Pathology at Beijing Agricultural University. After graduating this summer, I was assigned to work in Inner Mongolia. Before coming, there was an absurd saying among our classmates: "The sky is vast, the fields are boundless, I'm going to Inner Mongolia to herd sheep; the country's future is glorious, but my personal future is bleak." At that time, I myself had a strange, doubtful feeling. I wondered: Inner Mongolia is a pastoral area, what are they sending someone like me, who studies plant pathology, to do? Today, I have been on the job for three months, and I have a new understanding of Inner Mongolia and my work.

    In the vast area of Inner Mongolia, nearly half of the land is planted with crops, including a large number of special crops, some of which account for the largest proportion in the country. In terms of population, 80 percent of the working people are engaged in agricultural production. What I learned in plant pathology is very much needed in Inner Mongolia, just as it is in other parts of the country. Inner Mongolia is a part of our great motherland. It has fertile land, but there is still a lot of land lying idle; it has the largest pasture in the country, but there are still many places that are empty; it has one-sixth of the country's total forest area, as well as abundant medicinal materials and minerals. Inner Mongolia, like other parts of the country, is vigorously carrying out construction and is moving towards a happier life. Today's boundless wilderness will soon be a huge farm where hundreds of tractors are running at the same time. The green grasslands will be pastures for tens of thousands of cattle, horses, and sheep. In the past four years, the increase in livestock and grain, and the expansion of cultivated land have achieved astonishing results. This provides a reliable guarantee for the bright and splendid prospects of New Inner Mongolia.

    Young comrades: For a bright future, for the construction of the motherland's border areas, New Inner Mongolia eagerly awaits your active participation. You will be warmly welcomed by the people here. Here, your lofty aspirations for the construction of the great motherland will also be best developed.

### 我对新内蒙古的建设和我的工作有了新的认识

    我对新内蒙古的建设和我的工作有了新的认识
    我原是北京农业大学植物病理学系的学生。今年暑假毕业后，被分配来内蒙古工作。临来之前，我们同学之中有一种荒谬的说法：“天苍苍，野茫茫，我到内蒙去放羊；国家前途光芒万丈，个人前途暗澹无光。”当时我自己也有一种奇怪的、怀疑的心情。我奇怪：内蒙是一个牧畜地区，派我这个学植物病理的去干啥？今天，我踏上工作岗位已三个月了，我对内蒙和我的工作有了新的认识。
    在内蒙广大的区域内，有将近二分之一的土地种植着农作物，其中并有大量的特种作物，有些且在全国占着首要的比重。就人口来说，则有百分之八十的劳动人民从事着农业生产。我学的植物病理，对内蒙和对祖国其他地区一样，都是非常需要。内蒙是我们伟大祖国的一部分。这里有肥沃的土地，但是现在还有很多土地闲着；这里有全国最大的牧场，但是还有许多地方都空着；这里有占全国森林总面积六分之一的森林，以及丰富的药材和矿藏。内蒙也和祖国其他地区一样，正在大力进行建设，正在走向更幸福的生活。今天一望无际的原野，不久将是数百架拖拉机同时驰骋的巨大的农场。绿色的草原，将为数以万计的牛马羊群的牧场。最近四年来，牲畜和粮食的增加，耕地面积的扩大，都有了惊人的成绩。这就为光辉灿烂的新内蒙的远景提供了可靠的保证。
    青年同志们：为了美好的将来，为了建设祖国的边疆，新内蒙殷切地期待着你们踊跃前来。你们将会在这里受到人民最热烈的欢迎。在这里，你们对伟大祖国建设事业的壮志也会得到最好的发展。
