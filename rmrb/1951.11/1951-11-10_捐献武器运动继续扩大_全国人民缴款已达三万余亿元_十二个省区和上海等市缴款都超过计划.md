    Donation of Weapons Campaign Continues to Expand
    People Nationwide Have Contributed Over 3 Trillion Yuan
    Twelve Provinces/Regions and Cities Like Shanghai Have Exceeded Their Planned Contributions

    [By Our Newspaper] As of November 8th, the total amount of money donated by people nationwide for the purchase of airplanes and cannons has reached 3,184.7 billion yuan, according to incomplete statistics. This represents approximately four-fifths of the original total amount pledged. The amount of money donated by the people of Shanghai, Wuhan, Nanjing, Xi'an, Benxi, and provinces/regions such as Zhejiang, Hebei, Henan, Hubei, Gansu, Fujian, Qinghai, North Sichuan, North Jiangsu, West Sichuan, East Sichuan, and South Sichuan has exceeded the total amount of the original donation plans for each respective area. The campaign to donate weapons is continuing to expand in various regions. By November 1st, the pledged amount had reached 3,981.8 billion yuan. After the people of Shanghai exceeded their predetermined goal of donating 334 fighter planes on October 30th—contributing over 510 billion yuan—the Shanghai People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee and the Resist-America Aid-Korea Sub-Committee jointly sent a telegram to Chairman Mao and all representatives of the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, expressing their determination to resolutely implement the seven resolutions on the Resist-America Aid-Korea work adopted by this conference, expand the patriotic production increase and economy campaign, promote patriotic pacts, and transport more airplanes, cannons, manpower, and materials to the Korean front. By November 8th, the people of Zhejiang Province had contributed 258.8 billion yuan, exceeding the province's original donation plan (112 fighter planes, 8 cannons, and 10 anti-aircraft guns, totaling 183.2 billion yuan) by 41 percent. The patriotic donation campaign in the province is still expanding. Many areas that have completed their donation plans have enthusiastically launched patriotic production increase and economy campaigns. Around the anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' entry into Korea, Hebei Province once again launched widespread patriotic propaganda activities. Cities, counties, and towns held mass representative meetings of around 1,000 people, and grassroots organizations also held various meetings to promote the current situation, review production increase and donation plans, and revise patriotic pacts. The total amount of money donated by the people of the province has exceeded 154 billion yuan, which is 28 percent more than the original plan to donate 80 fighter planes. Currently, with the exception of Hengshui Prefecture, the amount of money donated by all cities and prefectures in the province has exceeded the pledged amount. Many areas are continuing to expand the donation campaign and launch production increase and economy campaigns. For example, workers in Tangshan City and the two prefectures of Tianjin and Cangxian have exceeded their plans by donating an additional airplane. The total amount of money donated in the North Sichuan region has reached 55.6 billion yuan, exceeding the region's original plan to donate 29 airplanes, 2 cannons, and 2 anti-aircraft guns by more than 18 percent. The business community of Dalian gloriously fulfilled the conditions of the challenge to the national business community, fully completing the original plan to donate 9 fighter planes and later adding one more on October 22nd. The Dalian Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Industry and Commerce Resist-America Aid-Korea Committee sent a telegram to the Resist-America Aid-Korea Headquarters, expressing their determination to continue strengthening the Resist-America Aid-Korea movement and strive to exceed the donation plan even further.

    However, the donation movement in some provinces and regions is developing relatively slowly. According to materials from the head office of the People's Bank of China on the actual receipts of donations from various regions, as of November 6th, the amount of money donated in Guangdong Province was only 42.6 percent of the total value of the province's pledged 100 fighter planes. The amount of money donated in several other provinces and regions is also less than 50 percent of the pledged amount. Even in provinces and regions that have completed the overall donation plan, some areas or individual units have not completed their donation plans. All regions should overcome this imbalance and strive to complete and continue to expand the weapons donation movement.

    捐献武器运动继续扩大
    全国人民缴款已达三万余亿元
    十二个省区和上海等市缴款都超过计划
    【本报讯】全国人民缴纳捐献飞机大炮款项到八日为止，据不完全统计，已达三万一千八百四十七亿元，约为原来认捐总额的五分之四。上海、武汉、南京、西安、本溪等市和浙江、河北、河南、湖北、甘肃、福建、青海、川北、苏北、川西、川东、川南等省、区人民的缴款数都超过了各该地区原订捐献计划的总额。各地捐献武器运动仍在继续扩大；到十一月一日，认捐数额已达三万九千八百十八亿元。上海市各界人民在十月三十日超额完成了预定捐献战斗机三百三十四架的目标——缴款五千一百余亿元之后，该市各界人民代表会议协商委员会与抗美援朝分会，曾联名致电毛主席和中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议全体代表，表示一定坚决贯彻这次会议所通过的关于抗美援朝工作的七项决议，扩大爱国增产节约运动，推行爱国公约，输送更多的飞机大炮和人力物力到朝鲜前线去。浙江省人民到十一月八日止已缴款二千五百八十八亿元，超过了该省原订捐献计划（战斗机一百十二架、大炮八门、高射炮十门，共折款一千八百三十二亿元）百分之四十一。该省爱国捐献运动仍在扩大中；许多完成了捐献计划的地区，热烈展开了爱国增产节约运动。河北省各地在庆祝志愿军出国作战一周年前后，再一次开展了普遍的爱国主义宣传活动。各市、县、镇都召开了千人左右的群众代表会，各基层组织也分别举行了各种会议，宣传了目前形势，检查了增产捐献计划，修订了爱国公约。全省人民缴款已超过一千五百四十亿元，比原订捐献战斗机八十架的计划已多出百分之二十八。目前除衡水专区外，全省各市、各专区的缴款数都超过了认捐数。许多地区并在继续扩展捐献运动和发动增产节约运动。如唐山市职工和天津、沧县两专区，都超过计划增献了飞机一架。川北区各地缴款已达五百五十六亿元，超过了该区原订捐献飞机二十九架、大炮、高射炮各二门的计划百分之十八强。大连工商界光荣地实现了向全国工商界挑战的条件，在十月二十二日全部完成了原订捐献战斗机九架及后来增献一架的计划。大连工商业联合会和工商界抗美援朝委员会并致电抗美援朝总会表示决继续加强抗美援朝运动，争取更多地超过捐献计划。
    但目前还有一些省、区的捐献运动发展得比较迟缓，据中国人民银行总行实收各地献款的材料，到十一月六日止，广东省缴款还只有该省认捐一百架战斗机总值的百分之四十二点六。还有若干省区的缴款数目也都还不到认捐数目的百分之五十。在已完成总的捐献计划的省、区中，也还有部分地区或个别单位没有完成捐献计划。各地应该克服这种不平衡状态，努力完成和继续扩大捐献武器运动。
