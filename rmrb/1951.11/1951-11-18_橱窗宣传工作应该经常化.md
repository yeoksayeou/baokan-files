Anti-American Aggression and Aid-Korea Work - Brief Comments

    Window Display Propaganda Work Should Be Regularized
    Window display propaganda is a new creation of patriotic shop assistants and industrialists and businessmen in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. This work has now been promoted in major and medium-sized cities across the country. The anti-American aggression and aid Korea propaganda pictures and models displayed in many store windows are constantly educating the masses in patriotism. According to Wuhan's statistics, the audience for window display propaganda in four months is about three million people. According to the statistics of Xihongji Cloth Store in Beijing, 180,000 people have visited their window display propaganda in the past three months.
    However, the biggest shortcoming of the current window display propaganda work is that it cannot be regularized. For example, in Dashilar, one of the busiest streets in Beijing, 76 of the 88 shops launched window display propaganda in July, but only 26 remained by the beginning of October. Some shops are still engaged in window display propaganda, but the materials are outdated and have long lost their propaganda significance. For example, Jianchun Tea House on Chongwenmen Inner Street in Beijing is still showing an "Anti-Drought Cotton Planting" model, even though it is now winter.
    In order to regularize window display propaganda work, we suggest that local shop employees' unions strengthen their leadership over this work and make it an important part of their regular work. Local federations of industry and commerce and art workers should also provide support and assistance. On the one hand, it is necessary to educate shop assistants and persuade and mobilize industrialists and businessmen to make them understand that patriotic propaganda is a regular task and to avoid being hot and cold; on the other hand, it is necessary to establish a certain organization to guide shop assistants and industrialists and businessmen in selecting appropriate propaganda themes in each period and to help them solve technical problems. At the same time, prevent the emergence of incorrect propaganda content or extravagance and waste. The shop employees' unions in Beijing and Wuhan have both held amateur training classes for shop assistants to train talents in window display propaganda. The shop employees' unions in Shanghai, Changsha, and other places have established window display propaganda work groups by system to specifically lead the window display propaganda work and have formed a judging committee in the city to evaluate and commend exemplary units in window display propaganda work. Many city shops have also included doing a good job in window display propaganda in their patriotic conventions. These are all necessary measures to regularize window display propaganda.

    橱窗宣传工作应该经常化
    橱窗宣传是爱国的店员和工商业者在抗美援朝运动中一种新的创造。现在全国各主要的大、中城市都已经推广了这一工作。许多商店橱窗中陈列的抗美援朝宣传图片和模型，每时每刻地在向广大群众进行爱国主义的教育。据武汉市统计，四个月中橱窗宣传的观众约有三百万人。北京市西鸿记布店统计，最近三个月参观他们的橱窗宣传的人有十八万。
    但是，目前橱窗宣传工作最大的缺点是不能经常化。例如北京市最热闹的街道之一——大栅栏，七月份八十八家商店中有七十六家搞起了橱窗宣传，到十月初只剩下二十六家了。有的商店虽然还在搞橱窗宣传，但材料已经陈旧，早已失去宣传意义。如北京崇文门内大街建春茶庄，现在已到冬季，但他们的橱窗里还在表演“抗旱种棉”的活动模型。
    为了使橱窗宣传工作经常化，我们建议各地店员工会加强对这一工作的领导，作为自己经常工作的重要内容之一。各地工商联合会和美术工作者，也应予以支持和协助。一方面要教育店员并说服和动员工商业者，使他们明了爱国宣传是经常的工作，不要犯冷热病；另方面要建立一定的组织，指导店员与工商业者在每一时期选择适当的宣传题材，并帮助他们解决技术上的问题。同时防止产生宣传内容不正确的东西或产生铺张浪费现象。北京、武汉两市店员工会，都举办了训练橱窗宣传人材的店员业余训练班。上海、长沙等地店员工会按系统成立了橱窗宣传工作组，具体领导橱窗宣传工作，并在全市组成评奖委员会，评选橱窗宣传工作的模范单位，予以表扬奖励。许多城市的商店把做好橱窗宣传工作也列入了爱国公约。这些，都是使橱窗宣传经常化的必要措施。
