    Leading cadres of the Tianjin Chemical Plant's Dagu Branch, under the Chemical Industry Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, did not rely on the masses, did not pay attention to production tasks, and did not study production techniques. As a result, in mid-June of this year, when changing the summer production operation procedures for bleaching powder, a large number of defective products were produced, resulting in a loss of 147 barrels of bleaching powder, worth more than 44 million RMB (losses before changing the operating procedures were not calculated).
    Bleaching powder production is one of the plant's important production tasks. Every summer, due to the increase in reaction heat, bleaching powder is extremely susceptible to becoming defective. Although the higher authorities have repeatedly instructed the plant to find ways to research and improve methods as soon as possible, this has not attracted the plant's attention. In early June of this year, the plant was still using winter operating methods, resulting in a daily increase in defective products. Plant Director Chen Renjie never went to the workshop to inspect, but only instructed foreman Li Shirong and technician Shen Shizhao to change the operating procedures based on reports. Because the leading cadres did not pay enough attention, Li Shirong and Shen Shizhao were perfunctory and did not conduct any research. They simply submitted last year's old summer operating methods for the plant director's approval and handed them over to the workshop for implementation. When the workers raised objections, a workshop meeting was called to discuss them, but Chen Renjie made excuses and did not attend. Li Shirong, Shen Shizhao, and others did not accept the opinions of the masses and went their own way. After the meeting, they did not report to the higher authorities and changed the operating procedures. They also failed to grasp the production situation after the change. When a large number of defective products appeared, Chen, Li, Shen, and others still believed that it was an inevitable phenomenon in the process of changing operations and failed to deal with it in a timely manner. It was not until the third night, when someone else came up with a salvage solution, that the losses were stopped.
    The above situation shows how irresponsible the plant's leading cadres and some staff are towards the people's property! This bureaucratic style is worth our vigilance. The plant's factory management committee has put forward preliminary opinions on the personnel involved in this case, which are being submitted to the relevant higher authorities for handling.

### 天津化学工厂大沽分厂领导干部  不依靠工人进行生产造成损失

    天津化学工厂大沽分厂领导干部
    不依靠工人进行生产造成损失
    中央重工业部化学工业局所属天津化学工厂大沽分厂领导干部不依靠群众，不重视生产任务，不研究生产技术，以致于本年六月中旬在改变漂粉夏季生产操作手续中，产生大批废品，损失漂粉一百四十七桶，价值人民币四千四百余万元（未改变操作手续前的损失尚未计算在内）。
    漂粉生产是该厂重要生产任务之一。每届夏季，由于反应热的升高，漂粉极易造成废品。上级虽屡次向该厂指示及早设法研究改进办法，但终未引起该厂注意。今年六月上旬该厂尚使用着冬季的操作方法，因而废品逐日增加。厂长陈仁杰从未到车间检查，只根据汇报指示工长李世荣、技术员沈士钊改变操作手续。由于领导干部重视不够，李世荣、沈士钊二人也就潦草塞责，未作任何研究，即将去年老一套的夏季操作方法，提经厂长批准，交车间执行。工人们提出意见，召开车间大会讨论，陈仁杰又托故未去参加。李世荣、沈士钊等更不接受群众意见，一意孤行，开过会未向上级报告，即将操作手续改变。改变后也未掌握生产情况，及至大批废品出现，陈、李、沈等仍认为是在改变操作过程中不可避免的现象，未能及时加以处理。直至第三天晚上，由别人提出了挽救办法，才停止了损失。
    上述情形说明了该厂领导干部及某些工作人员对人民财产是多么不负责任！这种官僚主义作风是值得我们警惕的。此案有关人员已由该厂工厂管理委员会提出初步意见，呈请上级有关机关处理中。
