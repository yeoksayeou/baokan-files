"Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese Edition Issue 116 was published on the 24th of this month. The editorial in this issue, "The Great Plan for Communist Construction is a Manifestation of the Soviet Peace Policy," points out: "The great plan for communist construction is a remarkable proof of the Soviet peace policy and a great contribution of the Soviet people to the cause of peace." "The Soviet Union's great communist construction plan, like a beacon of light, shines upon the world, giving courage to all ordinary people, filling them with confidence, filling them with joyful hope, and inspiring them to fight against the sinister plans of the instigators of a new war." The editorial concludes by emphasizing that "making the broad masses of people aware of the great international significance of the Soviet communist construction plan is an important and noble task of the Communist and Workers' Parties."

This issue prominently features Chairman Mao's opening speech at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on the second page. Also published is an article by Pont, a member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, entitled "The Great Victory of the French Communist Party in the Provincial Council Elections." Pont points out that in the two provincial council elections in France, the number of votes obtained by the Communist Party greatly exceeded that of other parties. This election shows that the French Communist Party is the largest party in France. From this article, it is clear that the influence of the French Communist Party is constantly growing.

The articles "Criticism and Self-Criticism in the Newspapers of People's Democratic Bulgaria" by Stekov, a member of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, and "Marxist-Leninist Education of Cadres of the Czechoslovak Communist Party" by Shisha, Minister of Propaganda and Agitation of the Central Committee of Czechoslovakia, introduce specific experiences in propaganda and education work.

This issue also includes articles such as "British Imperialism's Acts of Aggression Against Egypt," "Tito's Yugoslavia is a War Base for American and British Imperialists," and "The Brazilian People Strengthen the Struggle for Peace and National Independence." These articles expose the conspiracies of the American and British imperialists and their lackey Tito to undermine peace, and introduce the struggles of the Egyptian and Brazilian people for peace and independence.

The book review on the fourth page, "Struggle for Peace and the Construction of Socialism in Romania," introduces Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej's "Collection of Speeches and Essays." Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej was the General Secretary of the Romanian Workers' Party. The author believes that "Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej's works illustrate the theoretical and political foundation of the Romanian Communist Party's (later renamed the Workers' Party) line on important issues in the struggle for Romanian independence, socialism, and peace."
