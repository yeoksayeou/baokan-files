    The People's Love for Us Inspires Me
    ——After Reading "Great Love"

    Comrade Editor: I am a soldier of the People's Liberation Army. I was deeply moved after reading the article "Great Love" in the People's Daily on October 21st. I saw in the article that a PLA soldier was walking on a muddy road when a coach driver saw him and waved, "Comrade, take the bus! The road is too bad." This simple sentence shows how much love there is for the people's army! After the PLA soldier explained why he couldn't get on the bus, the passengers in the bus almost at the same time rushed to hand out three straw hats from the window, insisting that the PLA soldier wear them. What deep emotion this is! These things make me think that the people love the PLA so much because the people love their motherland and their lives. Our PLA protects the motherland and the people's happy lives, so the people love us so much. Thinking of this, I feel that my task is glorious and important. The people love us and want us to protect them, so our work cannot be slackened. I am determined to work harder in the future and strive to the end to strengthen national defense!

    人民对我们的热爱鼓舞了我
    ——读“伟大的爱”一文后
    编辑同志：我是一个解放军军人，我读了人民日报十月二十一日“伟大的爱”一文后。使我非常感动，我看到文中写着一位解放军战士在泥泞的路上走着，被一位客车司机看见了，便招手道：“同志，坐车吧！路太烂了。”这句平凡的话，表现了对人民军队多么热爱！当那位解放军战士说明不上车的原因后，车棚里的旅客们差不多同一时间，抢着从车窗里递出三个草帽，非叫这位解放军戴上不可。这是多么深厚的情感！这些事情使我想到人民这样热爱解放军，是因为人民都热爱自己的祖国，热爱自己的生活，我们解放军是保卫祖国、保卫人民幸福生活的，所以人民这样热爱我们。想到这里，我感到自己的任务光荣而重大。人民在热爱着我们，要我们来保卫他们，我们的工作是不能懈怠的。我下定决心，在今后的工作中，要加倍努力，为加强国防建设而奋斗到底！    解放军某部    章旭初
