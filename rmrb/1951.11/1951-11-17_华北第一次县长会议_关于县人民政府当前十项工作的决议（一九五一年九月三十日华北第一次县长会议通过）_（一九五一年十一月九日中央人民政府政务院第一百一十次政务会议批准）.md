The conference, in addition to unanimously agreeing to the report by Liu Lantao, Minister of the North China Affairs Department of the Central People's Government, on "Further Strengthening the Work of the County People's Representative Conference" and the report by Xie Juezai, Minister of the Interior of the Central People's Government, on "Conscientiously Strengthening Preferential Treatment Work" (the full text of which is on page 3 of today's newspaper) as two special resolutions of the conference, hereby makes the following decision based on the report by Comrade Bo Yibo on behalf of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the development of agricultural production in North China and the current specific situation in North China, as a basis for the work of the county and banner people's governments this winter and next year. It is hoped that people's governments at all levels will carefully plan, organize forces, and mobilize the broad masses to implement and achieve this.

First, continue to deepen the mass movement to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country, strengthen patriotic education among all the people, unite all the people, and do the following work well:

(1) Universally promote the patriotic pact movement. The formulation of patriotic pacts is an important method created by the people in the movement to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea to unite and educate themselves, a form that effectively combines the patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people with practical work, and also one of the basic methods for promoting various tasks. Therefore, places, enterprises, organs, and schools that have not yet formulated them must universally formulate them on the basis of mass consciousness and voluntariness, in combination with various practical tasks; those that have already been formulated but are not specific and practical should be supplemented or corrected, and checked regularly to constantly enrich and revise their content. We must oppose both the phenomenon of not attaching importance to the promotion of the patriotic pact movement and the formalism of signing patriotic pacts, so that the formulation of patriotic pacts becomes a regular and lasting mass movement.

(2) Mobilize people from all walks of life to continue to participate in supporting the Korean front, and strengthen the construction of the militia.

(3) Enhance the political and social status of the families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and staff members, conscientiously implement various preferential treatment measures, conduct regular inspections, and form a regular system. In rural areas, conscientiously mobilize and organize the families of martyrs and military personnel to engage in production, and cultivate a social atmosphere that regards production as glorious, but for military and martyr families who do not have the ability to produce, do a good job of farming on their behalf, ensuring that their land yield and living conditions are not lower than the level of the general public; in urban areas, earnestly do a good job of organizing production and introducing employment. Universally strengthen political education for the families of martyrs and military personnel, encouraging and organizing them to actively engage in production.

(4) Combine production increase with patriotic education to complete the patriotic donation plan, but oppose coercion and commandism; for those with special circumstances, donations should be suspended or appropriately reduced or exempted.

Second, get organized, help each other and cooperate, universally carry out the patriotic production increase movement; lead farmers to increase grain production, increase industrial raw materials (cotton, hemp, etc.) and increase export goods, strive to breed livestock, and restore and develop sideline and handicraft production; increase farmers' income in all aspects, so as to further adapt to the needs of national economic construction and improve farmers' lives. To this end, the following issues should be resolved:

(1) After two or three years of production increase movement since the land reform, new situations and new problems have emerged in North China's agricultural production. The most important demand of farmers is the expanded reproduction of agriculture. The cultivated land area in North China is relatively small, with an average of only three to five mu per person. To achieve expanded reproduction of agriculture on this basis, the main method is to increase the yield per unit area. According to this situation, the following ten agricultural construction tasks are proposed: (1) Concentrate efforts to solve the problem of agricultural tools. In addition to restoring old-fashioned agricultural tools, gradually promote the use of our existing new-style plows, new-style seeders, new-style harvesters, as well as new-style chaff cutters and large waterwheels where possible. The provincial people's government should establish one or several agricultural tool factories where necessary and possible, and the special commissioner's office and larger counties should establish agricultural tool repair factories or supply stations where possible. (2) Increase and apply more fertilizer, mainly by increasing large livestock such as mules, horses, cattle, and donkeys, and maintaining human excrement and urine. In addition, mountainous areas should raise more sheep, and plains should raise more pigs, with every family raising sheep and every household raising pigs, striving to solve the fertilizer problem. Under the help and combination of state-owned trading agencies and cooperatives, oil pressing factories should be universally restored to greatly increase cake fertilizer. (3) Develop animal husbandry, increase draft animals, pay attention to the prevention of animal diseases, promote draft animal insurance, and launch a movement to increase and love livestock. Restore and develop existing breeding farms, and plan to open new breeding farms with the special zone as a unit. The social status of individuals engaged in breeding livestock should be improved and not despised, so as to promote development. (4) Build dikes and embankments. Mountainous areas should build sloping land into terraced fields, prohibit opening steep slopes, and do a good job in soil and water conservation. Prevent drought, widen ditches, and repair river embankments to prevent floods. In addition to carrying out autumn soil preparation and digging locust eggs, preparations should be made for medicines and machinery, such as purchasing sprayers and 666 powder, to actively prevent diseases and pests.

(5) Popularize seed selection and promotion of improved varieties, and promote existing demonstration farms, ensuring that each county has at least one demonstration farm. It is also advocated that each mutual aid group and agricultural production cooperative reserve a small amount of land as a trial planting area for improved varieties, and various forms should be adopted to cultivate and promote excellent varieties.

(6) Where possible, rational sowing should be carried out according to the reasonable conditions of soil, water, and climate, so as to give full play to the fertility of the land and reduce the waste of cultivated land. Large-scale rational zoning of agricultural economy is not possible today, but in places that have already been organized, more rational sowing may be possible within a small range, gradually changing the unreasonable phenomenon of planting six or seven crops on one or two mu of land. (7) Afforestation and tree planting, implementing reasonable mountain closure and forest cultivation that takes care of the lives of people in mountainous areas, prohibiting burning mountains and clearing wastelands, indiscriminate logging, and universally carrying out tree planting movements, turning mountain gullies into orchards where possible, and carrying out a universal tree planting movement every year during the Qingming Festival. (8) Reward new records and new inventions in agricultural production. Establish a bonus system, with emphasis on rewarding those who can truly improve production, rewarding should be focused and heavily rewarded. Each province should allocate special funds as annual agricultural bonuses. (9) Restore and develop sideline production and handicraft production, which can provide some outlets for surplus labor and increase farmers' income. Localities can formulate local raw material supply, production implementation, and product sales plans according to specific conditions. (10) Establish senior agricultural technical schools at the provincial level. Special zones and counties should strive to train district and village cadres, labor models, activists in agricultural production, directors of agricultural production cooperatives, and mutual aid group leaders once in two years, giving them an education that combines scientific knowledge with practical experience to improve their production knowledge and operating skills.

(2) The movement of mutual aid and cooperation in agriculture based on private property, after nearly ten years of development, the broad masses of the people in North China have deeply experienced that getting organized is indeed far superior to working alone. However, at present, only half of the agricultural labor force is organized. Therefore, striving to organize the vast majority of male and female laborers in various forms of labor mutual aid and production cooperation within two years is a major task of all county people's governments.

The development of mutual aid organizations is currently mainly to develop temporary small mutual aid groups that are most easily accepted by the broad masses and long-term fixed mutual aid groups that are combined with sideline businesses, improved technology, and supply and marketing businesses. Mutual aid groups with certain public accumulation funds and public property, especially agricultural production cooperatives that also include land, have more vivid content and are a transitional form for guiding the broad masses of farmers from small-scale individual economy to agricultural collectivization. We must adopt a cautious and positive attitude towards this, and provide assistance and development in a planned and guided manner under the principle of farmers' voluntariness.

(3) Improve transportation conditions, strengthen material exchanges, universally establish supply and marketing cooperatives, absorb idle funds, revitalize rural credit, and strive to organize the production, processing, and sales of local and special products, while providing farmers with the necessary means of livelihood and production. Appropriately narrow the scissors difference between industrial and agricultural products to improve farmers' lives, expand the industrial market, promote the development of industry and commerce, and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.

(4) North China has a large proportion of mountainous areas, which are also old revolutionary base areas for a long time, but these areas have barren land, inconvenient transportation, and extremely difficult lives for the people. Therefore, the people's governments of each province, special commissioner's office, and county should pay special attention to and strengthen the leadership of agricultural production in mountainous areas. A long-term construction plan must be made and implemented year by year to gradually enrich them, so as to completely change the backward production and difficult living conditions of the people in mountainous areas. The main leaders of production in mountainous areas are to change sloping land into terraced fields, appropriately close mountains for afforestation, widely plant fruit trees, prohibit wasteland reclamation, maintain soil and water, develop animal husbandry, organize sideline production and handicraft production, promote mountain goods, and supply the necessary production and living materials; build necessary transportation routes and other tasks. Water areas and pastoral areas should also formulate long-term specialized production plans in accordance with local conditions.

(5) The North China region lacks rainfall and suffers from frequent droughts. People's governments at all levels must put drought prevention work on the main agenda, "preventing drought every year." The plan for the year lies in winter, and we must pay attention to the possible drought next year from now on. Each province and county should make specific drought prevention plans and implement them conscientiously.

(6) Do a good job in land survey and production determination, so that the burden is fair and reasonable, so as to further encourage farmers' enthusiasm for production.

Third, production for disaster relief. North China has suffered severe disasters this year, with a disaster-affected population of more than 10 million, especially in Chahar and Suiyuan. The central government is very concerned about this and has allocated a large amount of food and funds to carry out emergency relief and support production. The people's governments of the disaster-stricken counties and banners must regard production and disaster relief as the overriding central task. Seize the opportunity, concentrate efforts, carefully plan, go deep into villages and households, diligently check, and take all effective measures (such as organizing various forms of production, providing work as a form of relief, pre-purchasing agricultural and sideline products, establishing special disaster relief organizations, etc.) to ensure that no one starves or freezes to death and that the people are not displaced; protect livestock and reduce mortality; so as to survive the famine and earnestly prepare for next year's production.

Fourth, all towns and cities are economic, political, and cultural centers. Therefore, strengthening the leadership of urban work and industrial production, and organizing all the people in the towns and cities politically and economically, is one of the important tasks of all county and banner people's governments. All tendencies to neglect urban work are wrong. To this end, the following work must be strengthened:

(1) Strengthen the leadership of handicraft production. This is mainly because about 80% of the industrial products used by farmers are still handicraft products. Without strengthening the production of industry and handicrafts, it will be impossible to meet the needs of agricultural production development. Insufficient industrial products are still an obstacle to the development of agricultural production and the improvement of farmers' lives. Secondly, most handicrafts have certain development prospects. The continued development of these handicrafts will gradually develop from simple handicraft production to semi-mechanized and mechanized production, and will therefore become one of the foundations of our national industrial construction. Therefore, we must strengthen its leadership, help handicraft producers, form various industrial production cooperatives with different businesses and different forms, supply raw materials, sell finished products, improve management, and solve difficulties in production. Strengthen the work of workers in factories and workshops, establish and improve trade unions, improve their political awareness, improve technology, reduce costs, improve product quality, and increase production. Carry out democratic reforms, thoroughly destroy feudal remnants, appropriately change excessively long working hours, abolish restrictions on workers' participation in various political activities, and prohibit abuse of workers and apprentices.

(2) Small towns are the hubs connecting large and medium-sized cities and vast rural areas, and are the distribution centers for industrial and agricultural products. In order to organize the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and strengthen market management, it is necessary to organize public and private economies, and pay special attention to the universal organization and improvement of the work of supply and marketing cooperatives.

(3) Strengthen urban power construction. All towns and cities should convene people's representative conferences from all walks of life and exercise the functions and powers of the people's congress, electing the mayor and deputy mayor and government members of the town or city. To strengthen urban work, necessary institutions should be established and improved, and their cadres should be strengthened.

Fifth, continue to suppress counter-revolutionary activities in places where counter-revolutionary elements have not yet been completely eliminated, strengthen the construction of people's justice, and strive to do the following work well:

(1) Consolidate the existing achievements in suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and conscientiously implement the spirit of the Fourth National Public Security Conference. It is required that all places where suppression is not thorough or where the masses have not been sufficiently mobilized even though suppression has been carried out must conduct practical inspections district by district and village by village in conjunction with other work. Mobilize the masses, universally improve the political vigilance of the masses, overcome new paralysis, thoroughly destroy the Yiguandao, and not allow a single bandit to exist; continue to pursue and arrest fugitives and escaped bandits, bullies, special agents, reactionary party and group elements, and reactionary secret society leaders, so as to further stabilize social order, protect the lives and property of the people, and ensure the smooth development of various constructions. In places where suppression is relatively thorough, the focus should be shifted to the regular struggle against hidden counter-revolutionary elements.

(2) Strengthen the labor reform work of prisoners. Adopt a method of combining political control, ideological education, and supervised labor to control general counter-revolutionary elements. Actively carry out propaganda and education work for the families of counter-revolutionary elements.

(3) Strengthen anti-espionage and security work in finance and economy, factories and enterprises, transportation, and organs and schools. Through mass elections, establish mass-based public security and defense committees in a step-by-step and leadership-guided manner, formulate anti-espionage pacts, and consolidate and give play to the enthusiasm of the people in suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Model heroes in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries should be commended and rewarded.

(4) Strengthen the construction of people's justice, improve prison administration, thoroughly clear up backlog cases, and establish and improve the people's justice system.

Sixth, strengthen cultural education and health work, universally run winter schools, and develop and consolidate regular civil schools.

(1) Develop primary school education. In addition to reasonably using local food funds to run primary schools as well as possible, active measures should be taken to increase primary schools and their necessary equipment through civil-run and government-assisted methods or self-run methods by the masses. The practice of neither increasing funding nor allowing the masses to invest in running schools is completely divorced from the masses and should be corrected.

(2) Each county should plan to establish or attach simple normal schools to middle schools to cultivate a large number of teachers. Special attention should be paid to absorbing and training women to engage in people's education work, and some old gentlemen who agree with the Common Program can be appropriately absorbed to teach. In accordance with the new regulations of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, appropriately increase the salaries of cultural and educational workers, truly respect their political status, stabilize their work, strengthen their education, and organize their studies.

(3) In mountainous counties in old base areas, middle schools, normal schools, or agricultural technical schools should be planned and established by a single county or jointly by several counties under the unified plan of the provincial people's government.

(4) Give full play to the existing foundation of civil schools, rely on the backbone elements in civil schools, universally establish and run winter schools well, and mobilize farmers, especially young men and women, to enthusiastically participate in winter schools. On the basis of running winter schools well, gradually expand regular civil schools, popularize adult education, and gradually reduce illiteracy. The teaching content and curriculum of winter schools should be formulated separately under the principle of close integration of culture and politics.

(5) The damage caused by epidemic diseases to the lives and property of the people and production is very serious. The people's governments of each county and banner must strengthen the leadership of medical and health work, establish and improve the health administrative organizations of counties and districts, pay attention to epidemic prevention, and attach importance to mass hygiene, especially maternal and child hygiene. To this end, each county and banner should universally organize and improve the doctors' union in 1952, unite Chinese and Western doctors, and go to rural areas to see patients for the masses; those who are enthusiastic about treating the masses and imparting technology should be rewarded. To improve midwifery techniques, the county people's government should systematically train folk midwives in a planned way. Medical centers should be built in key market towns.

(6) Actively organize and lead all cultural and entertainment activities that are beneficial to the people, run cultural centers and clubs well, and earnestly guide the performances of old artists. The cultural and art troupes of each province, city, and special zone should go deep into the laboring masses and regularly go to rural areas and factories to carry out work.

Seventh, complete the land reform in Suiyuan this winter and next spring, and issue land certificates throughout the region to end all outstanding issues that need to be resolved, so as to completely complete this historical anti-feudal task.

Villages where the masses have not been sufficiently mobilized and the achievements of land reform have not been consolidated must conduct make-up lessons in conjunction with democratic power construction and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. For landlords who have reached the age limit for changing their class status, those who have truly participated in labor and abide by the law should be changed on schedule after being passed by the village people's congress or the village people's representative conference, reviewed by the district, and approved by the county; those who have not been reformed should continue to be deprived of their political rights; those who engage in sabotage activities should be punished according to law. All old-fashioned rich peasants in old liberated areas who meet the above conditions after three years of land reform should also change their class status in the same way; those who do not meet the above conditions should not be changed.

Eighth, conscientiously implement the Marriage Law, and earnestly protect women's human rights and complete marital autonomy. No one shall infringe or limit or trade marriages in disguised form. Overcoming the feudal remnants in the minds of some backward masses and some cadres should be regarded as an important task for a considerable period of time. Women should also further actively participate in production, strive to learn politics and culture, so as to improve their political and social status. To implement the Marriage Law, the following two issues should be focused on:

(1) The county and banner people's representative conferences and people's governments should discuss regularly and check the implementation of the Marriage Law in a planned way, and cooperate with women's, youth, and other relevant groups to formulate methods to ensure its realization. To make the Marriage Law deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, strengthen publicity. In addition to widely distributing the Marriage Law, the village people's governments should also be responsible for writing the Marriage Law on the walls in large characters, so that every household knows it and attracts attention.

(2) Any act of abuse of women should be strictly prohibited; those who injure or kill women due to marital problems must be strictly investigated and punished according to law. Important cases of violation of the Marriage Law may be selected and published in newspapers and announced in each village to publicize and educate the masses after sentencing.

Ninth, improve the ideological, policy, and cultural level of cadres, and train and replenish cadres.

(1) All cadres from workers, peasants, and other laboring people should strive to learn culture without exception. Cadres from intellectuals who have newly joined the work should go deep into the laboring masses and pay attention to the training of practical work. It is inappropriate to place these comrades in leading organs for a long time without letting them learn and train among the masses.

(2) Village cadres are an important bridge for the people's governments above the district level to specifically implement various policies and work among the masses. It is necessary to strengthen their assistance, improve their ideological and policy level, and improve their work style. The leadership should adopt the attitude of clarifying the truth and thinking of more ways to help them. At the same time, through the village people's representative conference, the masses elect the people they are willing to elect to handle affairs, which is an important method for selecting and educating cadres. Village cadres are one of the important sources of our various cadres, and we must attach great importance to their training and education.

(3) Properly solve the problem of cadres' illnesses. All cadres who are deemed by the leadership to need a considerable period of recuperation should be transferred from their posts and recuperate specially. The relevant supplies should be reimbursed in the quota of patients.

Tenth, further strengthen the work of the county and banner people's representative conferences, strengthen the leading role of the working class, consolidate and develop the people's democratic united front, and expand the mass base of the county people's government, which is the basic link in strengthening the construction of the county and banner people's power at present, and also an important guarantee for completing various work tasks. To this end:

(1) It is necessary to fully promote the people's democracy, earnestly protect the people's democratic rights, and let the masses go and mobilize the masses, so that the people can freely and unrestrictedly elect the people they are willing to elect as representatives to form the county, district, and village (township) people's representative conferences (or village (township) people's congresses), elect the people's governments at the same level, and exercise their power to manage the county, district, and village (township) people's power. Only such people's representative conferences and people's governments will further play their role as organizers and leaders of the political, economic, and cultural life of the broad masses of the people.

(2) Except for some counties and banners in Suiyuan, the people's representative conferences in all counties in North China should generally exercise the functions and powers of the people's congress in a planned and guided manner this winter and next spring, electing the county head, deputy county head, and members of the county people's government. This is an extremely important step in the current construction of democratic power, and also a great leap forward in the work of the people's representative conference. Only in this way can the broad masses of the people be more powerfully mobilized, difficulties be overcome, and the above-mentioned tasks and various instructions given to us by the Central People's Government be completed.

　　华北第一次县长会议
    关于县人民政府当前十项工作的决议
    （一九五一年九月三十日华北第一次县长会议通过）
    （一九五一年十一月九日中央人民政府政务院第一百一十次政务会议批准）
    会议除一致同意中央人民政府华北事务部刘澜涛部长关于“进一步加强县人民代表会议的工作”的报告和中央人民政府内务部谢觉哉部长关于“认真加强优抚工作”的报告，（全文见今日本报第三版）作为会议的两项专门决议外，兹根据薄一波同志代表中共中央华北局所作的关于发展华北农业生产报告和华北当前具体情况，特作如下决定，作为各县、旗人民政府今冬和明年工作上的依据。希各级人民政府，精密计划，组织力量，动员广大群众，贯彻实现。
    第一、继续深入抗美援朝保家卫国的群众运动，加强全体人民中的爱国主义教育，团结全体人民，作好下列工作：
    （一）普遍推行爱国公约运动。订立爱国公约是人民群众在抗美援朝运动中创造出来的用以团结和教育自己的重要方法，是把广大人民的爱国主义热情和实际工作有效地结合起来的形式，也是推进各项工作的基本方法之一。因此，凡未订立的地方、企业、机关、学校必须在群众自觉自愿的基础上，结合各项实际工作普遍订立；已订立尚不具体切实的，应加补充或改正，并定期检查，不断充实和修正其内容。既要反对不重视推行爱国公约运动的现象，也要反对形式主义地签订爱国公约，以使订立爱国公约成为一种经常持久的群众运动。
    （二）发动各界人民继续参加支援朝鲜前线的工作，加强民兵的建设工作。
    （三）提高烈属、军属、革命残废军人和工作人员家属的政治地位与社会地位，认真贯彻各项优待办法，定期检查，形成经常制度。在农村中认真发动组织烈属和军属从事生产，养成以生产为光荣的风气，但对没有生产能力的军属、烈属，就要做好代耕工作，保证他们的土地产量和生活条件不低于一般群众水平；在城镇切实做好组织生产、介绍职业的工作。普遍加强对烈属、军属等的政治教育，鼓励并组织他们积极生产。
    （四）结合增产和爱国主义教育，完成爱国捐献计划，但应反对强迫命令；有特殊情况者，应停收捐款或酌予减免。
    第二、组织起来、互助合作、普遍开展爱国丰产运动；领导农民增产粮食、增产工业原料（棉、麻等）和增产外销物资，努力繁殖牲畜，恢复和发展副业及手工业生产；从各方面增加农民收入，以便进一步适应国家经济建设的需要和改善农民生活。为此，应解决以下各项问题：
    （一）经过土地改革以后两三年来的增产运动，华北农业生产上已经出现了新的情况并提出新的问题。农民最主要的要求是农业的扩大再生产。华北耕地面积较小，每人平均耕地不过三亩到五亩，在这一基础上实现农业扩大再生产，其主要的方法是提高单位面积的产量。根据这一情况，提出十项农业建设工作如下：（1）集中力量解决农具问题，除恢复旧式农具外，在可能条件下，逐步推广使用我们现有的新式步犁、新式播种机、新式收获机以及新式铡草机、大水车等。省人民政府在必需和可能的条件下，建立一个或若干个农具工厂，专署和较大的县，在可能的条件下建立农具修理厂或供应站。（2）增产、增施肥料，主要的是增加大牲畜如骡马牛驴和保持人粪尿，此外，山区应该多养羊，平原应该多喂猪，家家养羊，户户喂猪，努力解决肥料问题，并在国营贸易机关和合作社帮助结合下普遍恢复榨油厂，大量增加饼肥。（3）发展畜牧事业，增加耕畜，注意耕畜防疫工作，推广耕畜保险，开展增畜爱畜运动。恢复和发展原有的配种场，并以专区为单位有计划地开办新的配种场。对个人经营种畜者，应提高其社会地位，不得鄙视，俾资发展。（4）修堤垒堰，山区应修坡地为梯田，并禁止开陡坡，做好水土保持工作。防止旱灾，广辟沟洫，修河护坝护田，以防治水患。除进行秋煞地、挖蝗卵等工作外，并应多多准备药械，购置喷雾器和六六六粉等，积极防治病、虫害。
    （5）普及选种和推广良种运动，推广现有示范农场，做到每县至少有一个示范农场。并提倡每一互助组和农业生产合作社留出少量土地，作为试种良种地，要采取各种形式，培育和推广优良品种。
    （6）在可能条件下，做到按照土壤、水分、气候的合理条件合理播种，以充分发挥地力，减少耕地的浪费现象。大规模的农业经济合理区划，今天还不可能，但在已经组织起来的地方，在小范围内则可能做到较合理的播种，逐渐改变在一、二亩土地上种六、七种作物的不合理现象。（7）造林植树，实行照顾山区人民生活的合理的封山育林，禁止烧山燎荒、滥伐林木，并普遍开展植树运动，在可能条件下变山沟为果木林，每年清明时节进行一次普遍植树运动。（8）奖励农业生产中的新纪录、新发明。确立奖金制度，奖励要着重真能提高生产者，奖励要有重点，要重奖。各省都应划出专款，作为每年的农业奖金。（9）恢复和发展副业生产和手工业生产，这样既可给剩余劳动力找到一些出路，又可增加农民收入，各地可视具体条件，订出当地的原料供应、实行生产和产品推销计划。（10）以省为单位设立高级农业技术学校。专区和县争取在两年内把区村干部、劳动模范、农业生产中的积极分子、农业生产合作社主任、互助组长等普遍轮训一次，给以科学和实际经验相结合的教育，以提高其生产知识和操作技能。
    （二）以私有财产为基础的农业上的互助合作运动，经过近十年的发展，华北广大群众已亲切地体验到组织起来比之于单干确有极大的优越性。但目前还只有一半农业劳动力组织起来。因之，争取在两年内把绝大部分男女劳动力组织在各种形式的劳动互助和生产合作中，是所有县人民政府的重大任务。
    发展互助组织，在目前主要地是发展为广大群众所最易接受的临时小型互助组和长年固定的并与副业、提高技术、供销业务相结合的互助组。有一定的公积金和公共财产的互助组，特别是把土地也加入的农业生产合作社，更有生动内容，是引导广大农民群众从小生产的个体经济走向农业集体化的过渡形式，对此我们必须采取谨慎而积极的态度，在农民自愿的原则下有计划、有领导地加以扶助和发展。
    （三）改善交通条件，加强物资交流，普遍建立供销合作社，吸收游资，活跃农村信贷，努力组织土产和特产的生产、加工与推销工作，同时，供给农民以必需的生活资料和生产资料。适当缩小工业品与农业品的剪刀差，以改善农民生活，扩大工业市场，促进工商业的发展，巩固工农联盟。
    （四）华北山地比重很大，它又是长期革命的老根据地，但这些地区土地贫瘠，交通不便，人民生活极困难，因此各省、专署和县人民政府均应特别重视和加强对山区农业生产的领导。必须做出长期建设计划，逐年实施。使之逐渐富裕起来，以彻底改变山区人民生产落后和生活困难的状况。领导山区生产主要者为变坡地为梯田，适当地封山育林，广植果木，禁止开荒，保持水土；发展畜牧，组织副业和手工业生产，推销山货，供给必要的生产生活资料；修建必要的交通路线等工作。水区和牧畜区亦应因地制宜，做出长期专门的生产计划。
    （五）华北地区雨量缺少，旱灾频繁，各级人民政府必须把防旱工作列在主要议事日程之上，“年年防旱”。一年之计在于冬，必须从现在起就注意到明年可能到来的旱灾。各省各县均应作出具体的防旱计划，切实执行。
    （六）做好查田定产，使负担公平合理，以进一步鼓励农民生产的积极性。
    第三、生产救灾。华北今年灾情严重，受灾人口约一千余万，尤以察、绥为最严重。中央对此十分关怀，并已拨付大量粮款，进行急赈和扶植生产。各受灾县、旗人民政府必须把生产救灾当成压倒一切的中心任务。抓紧时机、集中力量，精心计划，深入村户，勤加检查，采取一切有效措施（如组织多种多样的生产、以工代赈、预购农副产品、建立专门的救灾组织等），做到不饿死冻死一人，不使人民流离失所；保护牲畜，减少死亡；以便度过灾荒，切实准备明年的生产。
    第四、一切城镇都是经济、政治和文化中心，因此，加强对城镇工作和工业生产的领导，从政治上经济上把城镇全体人民组织起来，是所有县、旗人民政府的重要任务之一。一切忽视城镇工作的偏向都是不对的。为此必须加强下列工作：
    （一）加强对手工业生产的领导。这样做，首先是因为农民所用的工业品，目前百分之八十左右仍是手工业产品，不加强工业、手工业的生产，便无法适应农业生产发展的需要；工业品不足，仍是发展农业生产、改善农民生活的障碍。其次大部分手工业都有一定的发展前途，这些手工业的继续发展，将从单纯的手工业生产逐渐发展到半机器和机器生产，因而亦将成为我们国家工业建设的基础之
    一。因此，必须加强其领导，帮助手工业生产者，组成各种不同业务不同形式的工业生产合作社，供给原料，推销成品，改善经营，解决生产中的困难。加强工厂和作坊中的工人工作，建立和健全工会，提高其政治觉悟，改进技术，减低成本，提高产品质量，增加生产。进行民主改革，彻底摧毁封建残余，适当改变过长的工时，取消对工人参加各种政治活动的限制，禁止虐待工人学徒。
    （二）小城镇是大中城市和广大农村联接的枢纽，是工农业产品的集散地。为组织城乡物资交流，加强市场管理，必须组织公私经济，并特别重视普遍组织与健全供销合作社的工作。
    （三）加强城镇政权建设工作。所有城镇，均应召开各界人民代表会议并代行人民代表大会职权，选举城镇的正副镇长和政府委员。为加强城镇工作，应建立和健全必要的机构，并加强其干部。
    第五、在尚未肃清反革命分子的地方继续镇压反革命活动，加强人民司法建设，努力做好下列工作：
    （一）巩固镇压反革命的已有成绩，认真贯彻全国第四次公安会议决议的精神。要求一切镇压不彻底或虽有镇压而发动群众不够的地方，必须结合其他工作，逐区逐村进行切实的检查。发动群众，普遍提高群众的政治警惕性，克服新的麻痹思想，彻底摧毁一贯道，不许一个土匪存在；继续追捕逃犯和漏网的土匪、恶霸、特务、反动党团和反动会道门头子等敌人，以进一步稳定社会秩序，保护人民的生命财产，保证各项建设的顺利发展。凡镇压比较彻底的地方，重点应即转入经常的对暗藏反革命分子的斗争。
    （二）加强对犯人的劳动改造工作。用政治管制、思想教育与监督劳动相结合的方法，对一般反革命分子进行管制。对反革命分子的家属要积极地进行宣传教育工作。
    （三）加强财政经济、工厂企业、交通运输和机关、学校等方面的防奸保卫工作。经过群众选举，有步骤有领导地普遍建立起群众性的治安保卫委员会，订立防奸公约，巩固和发挥人民群众镇压反革命的积极性。在镇压反革命中的模范英雄，应予表扬奖励。
    （四）加强人民司法建设，改进狱政，彻底清理积案，建立与健全人民司法制度。
    第六、加强文化教育和卫生工作，普遍办好冬学，发展与巩固常年民校。
    （一）发展小学教育。除合理使用地方粮款，尽量办好小学外，并应采取民办公助或由群众自办等办法，积极增设小学及其必要的设备。那种既不给增加经费又不让群众自己出资兴办学校的做法，是完全脱离群众的，应该纠正。
    （二）各县应筹设或在中学校附设简易师范，大量培养师资。要特别注意吸收和培养妇女从事人民教育工作，并可适当吸收一些赞成共同纲领的老先生来教书。按照中央人民政府教育部新的规定，适当提高文教工作者的薪资，确实尊重其政治地位，稳定其工作，加强对他们的教育，组织他们的学习。
    （三）在老根据地的山地县，应在省人民政府统一计划下，由一县单独筹设或由数县联合筹设中学、师范或农业技术学校。
    （四）充分运用民校现有基础，依靠民校中的骨干分子，普遍建立并办好冬学，发动农民特别是男女青壮年热烈参加冬学。在办好冬学的基础上，逐年扩大常年民校，普及成人教育，逐渐减少文盲。冬学教学内容及课程，应在文化和政治密切结合的方针下分别制定。
    （五）疫症疾病对人民生命财产及生产的损害，是十分严重的。各县、旗人民政府必须加强对医药卫生工作的领导，建立与健全县、区卫生行政组织，注意防疫，重视群众卫生，特别是妇婴卫生。为此，各县、旗应在一九五二年普遍组织并健全医生联合会，团结中西医生，遍走农村，为群众看病；对于热心给群众治病、传授技术者，应予奖励。为改进接生技术，县人民政府应有计划地普遍训练民间接生者。有重点地在集镇建设医疗所。
    （六）要积极组织和领导一切有益于人民群众的文化娱乐活动，办好文化馆、俱乐部，认真指导旧艺人的演唱。各省市和专区的文工团应深入劳动群众，经常到农村和工厂中去进行工作。
    第七、今冬明春完成绥远的土地改革，并在全区范围内发完土地证，结束一切需要解决的遗留问题，以彻底完成这一反封建的历史任务。
    凡是群众发动不充分、土地改革成绩不巩固的村庄，均须结合民主建政与镇压反革命的工作，进行补课。对于已届改订成分年限的地主，凡已真正参加劳动、安份守法的，应经过村人民大会或村人民代表大会通过，经区审查，报县批准，如期改订其成分；其未经改造者，继续剥夺其政治权利；有破坏活动者，应依法制裁。所有老解放区的旧式富农在土地改革后合于上述条件已满三年者亦应以同样方式改变其成分；不合于上述条件者，则不得改变。
    第八、认真贯彻婚姻法，切实保障妇女的人权和完全的婚姻自主权，任何人不得侵犯或变相限制或买卖婚姻。应把克服一部分落后群众和某些干部的封建残余思想，作为相当长期内的重要任务。妇女亦应进一步积极参加生产，努力学习政治与文化，以提高自己的政治与社会地位。为贯彻婚姻法，应着重解决以下两个问题：
    （一）县、旗人民代表会议和人民政府均应定期讨论，并有计划地检查执行婚姻法的情况，协同妇女、青年及其他有关团体规定保证其实现的办法。为使婚姻法深入人心，加强宣传，除将婚姻法广为印发外，并应责成各村人民政府用大字将婚姻法写在墙上，务使家喻户晓，引起注意。
    （二）对于虐待妇女的任何行为，均应严格禁止；对于因婚姻问题而伤害或残杀妇女者，务必严加追究，依法制裁。重要的违犯婚姻法案件，于判处后可择其重要者刊登报纸，布告各村，以广宣传，教育群众。
    第九、提高干部的思想、政策和文化水平，培养和充实干部。
    （一）一切工人、农民及其他劳动人民出身的干部，应无例外地努力学习文化。新参加工作的知识分子出身的干部，则应深入劳动群众，注意实际工作的锻炼，把这些同志长期摆在领导机关内而不放在群众中去学习锻炼的作法是不妥当的。
    （二）村干部是区以上人民政府在群众中具体实施各项政策和工作的重要桥梁，必须加强对他们的帮助，提高其思想政策水平，改进其工作作风。领导上应采取讲清道理、多想办法的态度去帮助他们。同时，经过村人民代表大会，由群众选举自己乐意选举的办事人，乃是选择和教育干部的重要方法。村干部是我们各种干部的重要来源之一，必须十分重视对他们的培养和教育。
    （三）妥善解决干部疾病问题，凡领导上认为应该相当长期休养的干部，均应调离工作岗位，专门休养。该项供给均应在病员名额中报销。
    第十、进一步加强县、旗人民代表会议的工作，加强工人阶级的领导作用，巩固和发展人民民主统
    一战线，扩大县人民政府的群众基础，是目前加强县、旗人民政权建设的基本环节，也是完成各种工作任务的重要保证。为此：
    （一）要充分发扬人民的民主，切实保障人民的民主权利，放手发动群众，使人民能够自由地、毫不拘束地选出其乐意选举的人当代表，组成县、区、村（乡）人民代表会议（或村（乡）人民代表大会），选出同级的人民政府，行使其管理县、区、村（乡）人民政权的权力。只有这样的人民代表会议和人民政府才会进一步发挥其成为广大人民群众政治、经济、文化生活的组织者与领导者的作用。
    （二）除绥远部分县、旗外，华北全区所有县的人民代表会议，一般均应于今冬明春有计划、有领导地代行人民代表大会的职权，选举县长、副县长和县人民政府委员。这是民主建政当前极为重要的一个步骤，也是人民代表会议工作的一个极大的跃进。只有如此，才能更有力地动员广大群众，克服困难，完成上述各项任务和中央人民政府给我们的各项指示。
