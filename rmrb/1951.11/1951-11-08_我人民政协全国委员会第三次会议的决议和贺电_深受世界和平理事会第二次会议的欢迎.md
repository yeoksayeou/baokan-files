Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 7th. The resolution of the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on supporting the demand for a peace pact among the five major powers, and the telegram of congratulations to the Second Session of the World Peace Council, have been warmly welcomed and valued at the World Peace Council meeting. At the morning session on the 2nd, when Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese delegation serving as chairman, announced the receipt of the resolution and telegram of congratulations from the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the entire venue erupted in prolonged applause. Guo Moruo's speech was also frequently interrupted by applause. Frédéric Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, considered the resolution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to be of great significance and thanked the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference for its congratulations. He said: "Accepting such a grand telegram of congratulations is a first since the beginning of the peace movement. This will greatly encourage and promote the movement to defend peace."

At the morning session on the 5th, the entire venue welcomed Guo Moruo to the stage with enthusiastic applause, demonstrating the love and respect of peace fighters around the world for the representatives of the Chinese people. The participants listened attentively to Guo Moruo's speech. When he spoke of how Korea had not been conquered, that the American invading forces had been driven back near the 38th parallel, that the American policy of blockading China had failed, and that the Chinese people could appreciate Whitman's "Leaves of Grass" but utterly despised Acheson's "White Paper," the participants applauded frequently. After Guo Moruo's speech, Joliot-Curie, Nenni, Fadeyev, and others on the platform stepped forward to warmly shake hands with Guo Moruo and congratulate him.

On the afternoon of the 5th, the Chinese delegation presented gifts to the Austrian Peace Council. Ernst Fischer, representative of the Austrian Peace Council, delivered a speech in response. He said: "From the gifts from China, we can see China's long-standing culture. The Austrian people salute the victorious Chinese people." Mao Dun, a member of the Chinese delegation, said in his speech that he hoped that the Austrian people's desire for peace would be realized soon, and wished that the friendship and cultural relations between the Chinese and Austrian peoples would grow stronger day by day.
