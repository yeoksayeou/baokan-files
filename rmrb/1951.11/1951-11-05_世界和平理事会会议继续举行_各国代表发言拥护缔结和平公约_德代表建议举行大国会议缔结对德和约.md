Xinhua News Agency Report: At the World Peace Council's afternoon session on the 2nd, following the speech by the prominent Soviet writer Ehrenburg, the representative of the International Resistance Movement Participants and the League of Victims of Fascist Rule and Political Prisoners, Viver (France), who attended the meeting as a guest, spoke, suggesting that patriotic sentiments should be appealed to as a new way to attract people to participate in the peace movement. To prove the effectiveness of this approach, he cited the situation in Egypt as an example, where the peace movement had become a powerful struggle for national independence.

Bulgarian Professor Nadzhrekov, in his speech, emphasized that one of the main goals of the military bloc headed by the United States is to launch a war in the Balkans. To this end, the aggressors are using their pawns—the rulers of Greece and Yugoslavia. He said that Bulgaria opposes the war-mongers' aggressive plans with its peaceful construction and determination to safeguard peace. In Bulgaria, new factories are being built at an unprecedented rate. The number of schools and other cultural institutions at all levels is constantly increasing. This tremendous improvement in the cultural and economic life of the Bulgarian people is thanks to their friendship with the people of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies.

The glorious and courageous peace fighter, Mrs. Gordon, was greeted by a long applause from the council members and guests present at the meeting as she walked onto the podium. In her passionate speech, filled with love for peace, Mrs. Gordon particularly forcefully pointed out the importance of letting all people around the world hear the truth—the powerful weapon of peace fighters. Mrs. Gordon pointed out the great significance of publishing the report of the International Democratic Women's Federation delegation's visit to Korea and described the courageous activities of the members of the organizations affiliated with the International Democratic Women's Federation, who are trying to tell the world about the aggressors' crimes on Korean soil. Mrs. Gordon suggested that the World Peace Council should protest to the American occupation authorities in West Germany for sentencing Wachtel to eight months in prison simply because she told her compatriots the truth about what was happening in Korea. Mrs. Gordon emphasized the widespread response that the booklet "We Accuse" has aroused in various countries around the world, and called on the International Democratic Women's Federation to further expand the work of distributing materials on Korea and to regularly explain the most important issues of the day to the people of the world. Mrs. Gordon concluded by saying that spreading the truth is an effective way to pave the way for peace.

French representative Leclerc also delivered a short speech at the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 3rd Dispatch: The World Peace Council continued its meeting on the evening of the 2nd, chaired by Mrs. Streit, a member of the World Peace Council. The first speaker at the meeting was Professor Iverson from Finland. Professor Iverson said: Today, there are already more instruments of destruction than are necessary to destroy the entire globe. However, the expansion of armaments continues under the pretext of the threat of war. In order to save all peoples and their future, disarmament must be carried out immediately. Only a policy of disarmament can win the support of the vast majority of people, pacifists, and anti-militarists. Under the leadership of the vast ranks of peace fighters, the Finnish people have forced the Finnish government to stop building a police force larger than the pre-war police force. Representing the Finnish delegation, Iverson suggested that the World Peace Council appeal to all countries, whether members of the United Nations or not, to discuss and eliminate the causes of the current international tensions. He concluded by calling on all participants to do everything possible to ensure that all countries and all governments immediately disarm and use the funds used for military purposes to benefit the people.

When Professor Friedrich of Germany, a member of the World Peace Council, rose to speak, the entire audience welcomed him with prolonged applause. Friedrich reported on the German people's struggle for the peace and unity of Germany. He said that German peace fighters have a large number of documents proving that criminals, Nazi SS officers, and heads of secret police in West Germany are being released and are carrying out West Germany's re-militarization under American command. The American imperialists consider the restored German imperialism as their ally and are trying to establish a new German Wehrmacht led by former Hitler army officers. Friedrich emphasized that, in contrast to West Germany's preparations for war, the German Democratic Republic has consistently followed a policy of peace and good neighborliness in the two years since its founding. The treaties concluded by the German Democratic Republic with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Albania, and other countries are proof of this. Friedrich then pointed out that the popular vote on the issue of re-militarization showed that the majority of the people in West Germany want peace. He concluded by presenting the following suggestions to the World Peace Council meeting on behalf of the German delegation:

The German representatives to the World Peace Council demand that the Second Session of the World Peace Council protest the secret agreement concluded by the United States, Britain, and France in Washington. Because the purpose of this agreement is to prepare for a new world war, and this agreement also stipulates the conditions for absorbing West Germany into the preparations for war. The Washington Agreement stipulates that German industrialists, politicians, and soldiers, who should be held responsible for launching the Second World War, should be absorbed on a larger scale than before to prepare for the Third World War. The significance of the Washington Agreement for the German people is the indefinite continuation of Germany's division and the continued subordination of Germany to American interests. Its significance is the repetition of Hitler's disastrous policies. The majority of the German people oppose this policy and hope to take the path of peace. Therefore, the German representatives participating in the World Peace Council suggest that this session demand that a conference of foreign ministers of the Great Powers be held as soon as possible in order to conclude a peace treaty with Germany.

A peaceful resolution of the German question can pave the way for negotiations on the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact.

A peaceful resolution of the German question can greatly reduce the threat to world peace.

Czechoslovak representative Hrumadka said: The Czechoslovak people are resolutely fighting to maintain and consolidate peace. The entire Czechoslovak people are working on peaceful construction. The Czechoslovak Catholic Church has also made great efforts in the struggle for peace. Hrumadka said: The Czechoslovak people oppose the re-militarization of West Germany because the rearmament of West Germany is a great threat to the cause of peace. We welcome the German peace movement, and we hope for the emergence of a unified, peace-loving, and democratic Germany. A few days ago, our people warmly welcomed the President of the German Democratic Republic, Pieck. He came to our country as a sincere friend of our people. We are doing our best to consolidate our friendship with the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, and other countries. We have eliminated the mutual distrust that previously existed in the hearts of the people of these countries.

Dutch representative Pastor Dahlen followed and said: The Dutch people support the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact. Peace! Friendship between the people of all countries!—These slogans have penetrated deep into the hearts of ordinary people in the Netherlands. We understand more clearly than before that Americanism—this material and spiritual terror—has paralyzed our people. This terror prevents us from understanding the truth about the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies.

Finally, World Peace Council member and Australian pastor Hartley spoke at the meeting. Hartley told the conference that, in addition to the Australian Peace Council, many Methodist and Presbyterian organizations are now actively advocating the defense of peace. Hartley said: A new movement has emerged in Australia, a movement against the re-militarization of Japan. Ninety percent of the members of Australian trade unions oppose the government's policy on Japan. America's policy towards Japan has touched on the most wary issue in Australian policy. Hartley said: Therefore, the main task is to link the Japanese question with the general struggle against the conspiracies of the war-mongers, with the issue of West Germany's re-militarization, and with the issues of Korea, Malaya, and Vietnam. Hartley concluded by saying: Australian peace fighters are planning to hold a youth peace festival in Sydney in early next year, and they will invite cultural and sports representatives from various countries, as well as representatives from the World Peace Council, to participate. Hartley hoped that the World Peace Council would provide all possible assistance in organizing this festival.

    世界和平理事会会议继续举行
    各国代表发言拥护缔结和平公约
    德代表建议举行大国会议缔结对德和约
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：世界和平理事会在二日下午的会议上，继苏联著名作家爱伦堡发言之后，有应邀以来宾资格参加会议的国际抵抗运动参加者及法西斯统治下受害人与政治犯联盟的代表、维佛（法国）发言，他建议应该诉之于爱国情绪，把这当作吸引人民参加和平运动的新方式。为着证明这个方式有效起见，他举出了埃及的情形作例子，在埃及，和平运动变成了争取民族独立的有力斗争。
    保加利亚的那德热科夫教授在发言中着重指出：以美国为首的军事集团的主要目的之一，就是在巴尔干发动战争。为着这个目的，侵略者正在利用它们的走狗——希腊和南斯拉夫的统治者。他说：保加利亚以和平建设和确保和平的意志来对抗战争贩子的侵略计划。在保加利亚，新的工厂正以空前的速度建设起来。各级学校和其他文化机关的数目不断增加。保加利亚人民的文化和经济生活所以有这样巨大的提高，要感谢他们和苏联及人民民主国家人民的友谊。
    光荣勇敢的和平战士戈登夫人走上讲台，受到了出席会议的理事们和来宾们长时间的鼓掌欢迎。戈登夫人在她充满了对和平的热爱的热情发言中，特别有力地指出了使全世界各族人民都听到真理——和平战士的有力武器——的重要性。戈登夫人指出了公布国际民主妇女联合会代表团访问朝鲜的报告的重大意义，并描述了国际民主妇联所属各团体的会员们的勇敢活动，她们正设法把侵略者在朝鲜国土上的罪行告诉全世界。戈登夫人建议世界和平理事会向西德美国占领当局提出抗议，抗议该占领当局只因为瓦赫特把关于在朝鲜发生的事情的真相告诉了她的同胞，就把她判处八个月徒刑。戈登夫人着重指出小册子“我们控诉”在世界各国所引起的广泛反应，要求国际民主妇联进一步扩大散发关于朝鲜的材料的工作，并经常向全世界人民说明当代的最重要的问题。戈登夫人最后说：传播真理就是有效地为和平铺平道路。
    法国代表李克莱克也在会上发表了简短的演说。
    【新华社讯】据塔斯社维也纳三日电：世界和平理事会在二日晚间继续开会，由世界和平理事会理事斯崔特夫人担任主席。在会上首先发言的是芬兰的伊维尔逊教授。伊维尔逊教授说：今天，现有的破坏工具已经比毁灭全球所必需的还要多。但是，扩张军备的活动仍在战争威胁的藉口下继续进行着。为了拯救各族人民和他们的未来，就必须立即裁减军备。只有实行裁减军备的政策，才能得到广大人民、非战主义者与反军国主义者的拥护。在广大的和平战士的领导下，芬兰人民曾迫使芬兰政府停止编建比战前警察队还要大的警察部队。伊维尔逊代表芬兰代表团建议世界和平理事会吁请各个国家，无论是联合国会员国或是非会员国，讨论并消除造成目前国际紧张形势的原因。他最后要求全体与会者竭尽所能使一切国家与一切政府立即裁减军备，以用于军事目的的款项来为人民谋福利。
    世界和平理事会理事、德国的腓特烈教授起立发言时，全场以经久不息的掌声对他表示欢迎。腓特烈报告了德国人民争取德国的和平与统一的斗争。他说：德国的和平战士已有大批的文件可证明西德境内的罪犯、纳粹党卫军和秘密警察的首领们正被释放，他们正在美国指挥之下进行西德重新军事化的活动。美帝国主义者认为恢复起来的德帝国主义是它的盟友，正在设法建立由前希特勒军队将校率领的新的德国国防军。腓特烈着重指出：和西德的准备战争相反，德意志民主共和国在它建国以来的两年中始终遵循和平与睦邻的政策。德意志民主共和国和苏联、中华人民共和国、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚及其他国家所缔结的条约就是证明。腓特烈接着指出：对重新军事化问题所进行的人民投票，表明西德大多数人民是要和平的。他最后代表德国代表团向世界和平理事会会议提出下列建议：
    世界和平理事会的德国代表要求世界和平理事会第二届会议抗议美、英、法三国在华盛顿缔结的秘密协定。因为这一个协定的目的，是准备新的世界大战，这一个协定，也规定吸收西德参加备战活动的条件。华盛顿协定规定要吸收应该对发动第二次世界大战负责任的德国工业家、政客和军人，以较前更大的规模，准备第三次世界大战。华盛顿协定的意义，对于德国人民来说，就是德国无限期的继续分裂，就是德国的继续服从美国的利益。它的意义就是希特勒的祸害深重的政策的重演。德国人民大多数都反对这种政策，希望走和平的道路，因此，参加世界和平理事会的德国代表们，建议本届会议，要求在最短期间内举行大国外交部长会议，以期缔结对德和约。
    德国问题的和平解决，可以为五大国缔结和平公约的谈判扫清道路。
    德国问题的和平解决，可以大大减轻世界和平所受的威胁。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表赫鲁玛德卡发言说：捷克斯洛伐克人民正在坚决地为维持并巩固和平而斗争。捷克斯洛伐克全国人民都正在致力于和平建设的劳动。捷克斯洛伐克天主教会也在和平斗争中尽了很大的努力。赫鲁玛德卡说：捷克斯洛伐克人民反对西德的重新军事化，因为西德的重新武装，是对于和平事业的极大威胁。我们欢迎德国的和平运动，我们希望统一、爱好和平的民主德国的出现。几天以前，我国的人民曾热烈地欢迎德意志民主共和国总统皮克。他是以我国人民的真诚的友人的身份来到我国的。我们正以全力来巩固与德意志民主共和国、波兰、保加利亚、罗马尼亚和其他国家的友谊。我们已消除了以前这些国家人民心里的互不信任的心情。
    荷兰代表达伦牧师继起发言说：荷兰人民拥护缔结五大国和平公约。和平！各国人民友好！——这些口号已经深入到荷兰普通人民的心坎。我们较以前更清楚地了解：美利坚主义——这个物质上和精神上的恐怖——已经使我国人民麻痹。这个恐怖阻止我们了解苏联和人民民主国家的真相。
    世界和平理事会理事、澳大利亚牧师哈特莱最后在会上讲话。哈特莱告诉大会：除了澳大利亚和平理事会外，有许多美以美教会和长老会的组织，现在也积极起来拥护保卫和平的主张。哈特莱说：在澳大利亚已经发生了一种新的运动、反对日本重新军国主义化的运动。澳大利亚各工会百分之九十的会员都反对政府对日本问题的政策。美国的对日政策已触到澳大利亚人的政策中所最有戒心的问题。哈特莱说：所以，主要的工作是把日本问题和反对战争贩子阴谋的总斗争、和西德重新军事化问题、和朝鲜、马来亚及越南问题联系起来。哈特莱最后说：澳大利亚和平战士正计划在明年年初在悉尼召开青年和平联欢大会，他们将邀请各国文化和体育代表以及世界和平理事会代表参加。哈特莱希望世界和平理事会对于组织这次联欢大会给以一切可能的协助。
