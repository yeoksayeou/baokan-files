On November 8th, Mr. Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation to the Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, on behalf of the Soviet government, submitted four peace proposals to the Assembly. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China hereby authorizes me to express its complete agreement with these four peace proposals of the Soviet government.

The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China believes that the Soviet government's four peace proposals are the most effective and reasonable plan for eliminating the threat of another world war and consolidating international peace and security. In contrast, U.S. President Truman's broadcast speech on November 7th, and U.S. Secretary of State Acheson's U.S., British and French proposals announced in his November 8th speech, are using empty talk about disarmament to cover up their intensified preparations for a war of aggression. In this way, two completely different world political lines are clearly laid out at the Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly: one is the political line of defending peace, headed by the Soviet Union; the other is the political line of creating war, headed by the United States. The Government of the People's Republic of China firmly supports the line of defending peace and firmly opposes the line of creating war.

The Chinese people support the United Nations Charter. The Chinese people believe that the United Nations should become an organization for defending peace and not an organization for creating war. However, because the United Nations is currently under the manipulation of the U.S. government, it has passed many illegal, shameful, and aggressive resolutions, and has repeatedly excluded and slandered the People's Republic of China. It has violated the principles of consolidating international peace and security and is increasingly becoming a tool to meet the needs of American aggressors. At the same time, the U.S. government's forced use of the United Nations flag to openly wage a war of aggression in Korea has further stained the United Nations with the most dishonorable stain. In this situation, the Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly can only regain the status of the United Nations by resolutely rejecting the U.S. government's political line of creating war and fully adopting the Soviet government's political line of defending peace.

Since the end of World War II, the U.S. government, in its vain attempt to dominate the world, has not hesitated to become an enemy of the people of the world. In Europe, it inherited the aggressive plans of fascist Germany; in Asia, it inherited the aggressive plans of fascist Japan, and merged the aggressive plans of the two fascist countries of Germany and Japan, developing them into the most vicious aggressive war plan. Aggression against Korea, occupation of China's Taiwan, conclusion of a separate "peace treaty" with Japan, arming Japan, concluding so-called "security treaties" bilaterally or multilaterally in the Pacific, expanding the aggressive bloc of the North Atlantic Treaty, arming West Germany, carrying out aggressive plans in the Middle East, massive expansion of armaments, establishment of military bases everywhere, and massive production of atomic bombs, etc., are all component parts of this most vicious aggressive war plan. In order to eliminate the threat of the imperialist camp headed by the United States preparing for a new war, and in order to consolidate international peace and security, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China also believes that the North Atlantic aggressive bloc and the aggressive blocs that the United States attempts to organize in the Pacific region and the Middle East similar to the North Atlantic bloc are incompatible with the qualifications of United Nations members, and the actions of some countries headed by the United States in establishing military bases on foreign territories are also incompatible with this qualification. Therefore, the Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly should reject them. The Government of the People's Republic of China firmly believes that holding a world conference of governments of all countries to study disarmament issues, prohibiting atomic weapons, and establishing international control to supervise the implementation of this prohibition will first be conducive to eliminating international tensions, in order to seek lasting world peace.

The Korean question is the most concerning issue for people all over the world today. The U.S. government and its vassal states, under the guise of the United Nations flag, are waging a war of aggression against the Korean people, which is an unjust war. The war waged by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to resist the aggression of the U.S. government and its vassal states is a just war. The Chinese people love peace and at the same time love justice. We do not want to invade any country, but we will never tolerate imperialist aggression against our country. When the U.S. troops occupied China's Taiwan, invaded the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and kept advancing to our northeastern border, the Chinese people had to rise up in resistance. At this time, the Chinese people and government, just as at the beginning of the U.S. war of aggression against Korea, have been expressing that the Korean question should be resolved by peaceful means. The Chinese people's proposition for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question has always been consistent with the Soviet people's proposition for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question. Therefore, when Mr. Malik, the Soviet representative to the United Nations, proposed on June 23 of this year that negotiations between the belligerent parties for an armistice and the withdrawal of troops from both sides of the 38th parallel should be the first step towards achieving a peaceful resolution of the Korean question, the Chinese and Korean people were the first to respond to this proposal and expressed their willingness to reach an armistice agreement quickly on a fair and reasonable basis in order to further strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question and other issues in the Far East. Since the Korean armistice negotiations began on July 10 of this year, four months have passed, and the reason why the armistice negotiations have not reached an agreement is definitely not because there is no realistic basis for reaching such an armistice agreement on the Korean battlefield, nor is it because the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have not proposed a fair and reasonable armistice plan, but because of the U.S. government's obstruction, sabotage, and lack of sincerity in the negotiations. Due to domestic and foreign reasons, the U.S. government attempts to delay or even undermine the progress of the armistice negotiations as much as possible in order to continue to maintain the tense state of the world and facilitate its conspiracy to expand war preparations. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China fully agrees with the Soviet government's proposal to the Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly on resolving the Korean question, and believes that as long as the U.S. government is willing to resolve the issue on a fair and reasonable basis and no longer uses various shameful methods to undermine and obstruct the progress of the negotiations, then a Korean armistice agreement as the first step towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean question can be concluded, otherwise it cannot be concluded.

Today, any major international issue cannot be resolved if the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China do not participate. Therefore, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China fully agrees with the Soviet government's proposal to the Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly on concluding a peace pact among the five major powers of China, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France. If a peace pact among the five major powers can be concluded and joined by all other peace-loving countries, it will greatly contribute to the peaceful handling of many major and complex issues in the current international situation.

It must be pointed out that the ruling classes of many capitalist countries, especially the ruling class of the United States, because they are greedy for the excess profits obtained from expanding armaments, deceive the people of their respective countries every day, saying that world peace has no realistic basis. The Chinese people believe that the facts are contrary to this deception, that world war is not inevitable, and that world peace does have a realistic basis. For thirty-four years, the Soviet government's consistent peaceful foreign policy of peaceful coexistence between socialist countries and capitalist countries has been the most realistic foundation for world peace. In the past two years, based on the principle of peaceful coexistence, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has established normal diplomatic relations with many countries whose social systems are fundamentally different from those of New China on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, strengthening world peace, especially strengthening Asian peace. The Chinese people not only demand peace, but also firmly believe that the strength of the Chinese people's political, economic, and defense capabilities is sufficient to strengthen the ranks of peace-loving people all over the world and is sufficient to serve as a backing for defending peace.

The Chinese people firmly believe that if the two major allied nations of China and the Soviet Union unite as one, all people's democratic countries unite as one, and all peace-loving countries and people in the world unite as one, peace will be able to defeat war.

### 中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来  对苏联政府向联合国第六届大会提出四项和平建议的声明

    中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来
    对苏联政府向联合国第六届大会提出四项和平建议的声明
    十一月八日，出席联合国第六届大会苏联代表团团长维辛斯基先生，奉苏联政府之命，向大会提出四项和平建议。中华人民共和国中央人民政府兹特授权本人对苏联政府这四项和平建议，表示完全赞同。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为苏联政府四项和平建议是消除另一次世界大战的威胁和巩固国际和平与安全的最有效与最合理的方案。相反，美国总统杜鲁门十一月七日的广播演说，以及美国国务卿艾奇逊在其十一月八日演说中公布的美、英、法三国建议，则是以所谓裁减军备的空谈来掩盖其加紧准备战争的阴谋政策。这样一来，在联合国第六届大会上，就鲜明地摆出了两条完全不同的世界政治路线：一条是以苏联为首的保卫和平的政治路线；一条是以美国为首的制造战争的政治路线。中华人民共和国政府是坚决拥护保卫和平的路线，并坚决反对制造战争的路线的。
    中国人民是拥护联合国宪章的。中国人民认为联合国应当成为保卫和平的组织而不应当成为制造战争的组织。但是由于目前联合国在美国政府的操纵之下，通过了许多非法的可耻的侵略性的决议，并一再排斥和诽谤中华人民共和国，它业已违反巩固国际和平与安全的原则，日益变成满足美国侵略者需要的工具。同时，又由于美国政府强迫利用联合国的旗帜公开在朝鲜进行侵略战争，使联合国更蒙上了最不光荣的污点。在这种情况下，联合国第六届大会，只有坚决拒绝美国政府制造战争的政治路线，完全采纳苏联政府保卫和平的政治路线，才能挽回联合国的地位。
    从第二次世界战争结束后，美国政府由于妄图称霸世界，竟不惜与世界人民为敌，在欧洲继承了法西斯德国的侵略计划，在亚洲继承了法西斯日本的侵略计划，并将德日两个法西斯国家的侵略计划合并起来，加以发展，造成一个最凶恶的侵略战争计划。侵略朝鲜，侵占中国的台湾，缔结单独对日“和约”，武装日本，订立太平洋上双边或多边的所谓“安全条约”，扩大北大西洋公约的侵略集团，武装西德，进行在中东的侵略计划，大量扩充军备，到处建立军事基地并大量制造原子弹等等，就是这一最凶恶的侵略战争计划的各个组成部分。为了消除以美国为首的帝国主义阵营准备新的战争的威胁，为了巩固国际和平与安全，中华人民共和国中央人民政府同样认为北大西洋侵略集团以及美国企图在太平洋区和中东组织的类似北大西洋集团的侵略集团，都是与联合国会员国资格相抵触的，以美国为首的某些国家在外国领土上建立军事基地的行为，也是与这个资格不能相容的，因此，联合国第六届大会都应该予以否定。中华人民共和国政府深信由一切国家的政府举行世界会议来研究裁军问题，禁止原子武器和建立国际管制以监督这一禁令的实施，将首先有利于消除国际紧张局势，以便于谋取世界持久和平。
    朝鲜问题是今天全世界人民最关心的问题。美国政府及其仆从国家，盗用联合国的旗帜，进行侵略朝鲜人民的战争，这是非正义的战争。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国反抗美国政府及其仆从国家的侵略而进行的战争，则是正义的战争。中国人民热爱和平，同时热爱正义。我们不要去侵犯任何国家，但我们决不能容忍帝国主义对于我国的侵略。当着美国军队占领中国的台湾，侵略朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，并一直打到了我国的东北边疆的时候，中国人民就不能不起而抵抗。就在这个时候，中国人民和政府仍和在美国侵朝战争初起时一样，一直在表示朝鲜问题应当用和平方法予以解决。中国人民和平解决朝鲜问题的主张与苏联人民和平解决朝鲜问题的主张始终是一致的。因而，当在本年六月二十三日苏联出席联合国代表马立克先生提出以交战双方谈判停战，双方军队撤离三八线作为实现和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步的建议时，中朝人民首先响应了这个建议，并表示愿意在公平合理的基础上迅速达成停战协议，以便进一步争取朝鲜问题以及远东其他问题的和平解决。从本年七月十日朝鲜停战谈判开始以来，至今已过四月，停战谈判之所以未能获致协议，决不是由于朝鲜战场没有足以获致这种停战协议的现实基础，更不是由于朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军没有提出公平合理的停战方案，而是由于美国政府对于谈判的阻挠、破坏和缺乏诚意。美国政府由于内政外交的原因，企图尽量拖延甚至破坏停战谈判的进行，以继续保持世界的紧张状态而便其进行扩大战争准备的阴谋计划。中华人民共和国中央人民政府完全赞同苏联政府向联合国第六届大会所提关于解决朝鲜问题的建议，并认为只要美国政府愿意在公平合理的基础上解决问题，不再用种种可耻的方法来破坏和阻挠谈判的进行，则作为和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步的朝鲜停战协定是可能缔成的，否则就不可能缔成。
    今天国际上的任何重大问题，如果没有苏联和中华人民共和国的参加，都是无法解决的，因而中华人民共和国中央人民政府完全赞同苏联政府向联合国第六届大会所提关于缔结中华人民共和国、苏联、美国、英国和法国五大国和平公约的建议。五大国和平公约如能缔结，并得到其他一切爱好和平的国家的参加，将大大有助于以和平的方法处理目前国际形势中许多重大而复杂的问题。
    必须指出：许多资本主义国家的统治阶级，特别是美国的统治阶级，由于贪图因扩充军备而获得的超额利润，天天欺骗各该国人民，说什么世界和平是没有现实基础的。中国人民认为事实和这种欺骗相反，世界战争不是不可避免的，世界和平是确有现实基础的。三十四年来，苏联政府一贯坚持的社会主义国家与资本主义国家和平共处的和平外交政策，就是世界和平最现实的基础。两年来，中华人民共和国中央人民政府基于和平共处的原则，曾经与许多和新中国社会制度基本不同的国家在平等、互利及互相尊重领土主权的基础上建立了正常外交关系，加强了世界和平，特别是加强了亚洲和平。中国人民不仅要求和平，而且深信中国人民政治、经济、国防各方面的力量足以加强全世界爱好和平人民的队伍，足以作为保卫和平的后盾。
    中国人民深信：中苏两大盟邦团结一致，一切人民民主国家团结一致，世界上一切爱好和平的国家和人民团结一致，和平是能够战胜战争的。
