　　New China is one of the greatest pillars of world peace
    Sunderlal, Head of the Indian Goodwill Delegation to China
    Editor's Note: Before leaving Beijing, Sunderlal, head of the Indian Goodwill Delegation to China, member of the All-India Peace Council, and writer, who was invited to participate in our National Day celebrations, was invited to speak on the Central People's Broadcasting Station. The station broadcast a recording of his speech on October 27. The following is the translation of his speech.
    On the morning of September 22, 1951, as our ship approached the mainland of New China from Hong Kong, the sound of firecrackers, the decorations of Guangzhou port, and the military music played by the military band made us feel that a grand welcome was awaiting us. From that time until now, as I speak, every member of our Indian delegation is deeply grateful to the Chinese government and the Chinese people for their warm and generous hospitality. We are about to return to India with pleasant memories, memories that will never fade.
    We have visited public and private enterprises and factories in New China. We have visited universities in New China. We have seen the achievements of Chinese workers' organizations, youth organizations, women's organizations, cooperatives, and drama and film work. We have also visited trading markets, streets and alleys, and rural areas. Everywhere we went, we were deeply moved by the love of people from all walks of life for their new country and their leader, Chairman Mao Zedong.
    In the short span of two years, New China has solved many difficult problems that leaders or administrative heads of many countries have been unable to solve. It has eliminated beggars and prostitutes from its vast territory. It has completely eradicated corruption among officials, who, two years ago, were among the most corrupt in the world. We found that in factories, the difference between the salaries of ordinary unskilled workers and factory directors or those in charge was very small. In the Guangdong Paper Mill, a large factory in Guangzhou, the ratio between the lowest wage and the highest wage was three to eight. In a factory in Beijing, an ordinary female worker earned a monthly salary of 250 jin of millet, while the factory director earned 350 jin of millet. We saw that almost all civil servants in New China, from the highest to the lowest, calculated their salaries in terms of millet rather than paper money. The clothing of government ministers was virtually indistinguishable from that of university presidents, ordinary civil servants, or factory workers. At a glance, it was difficult to immediately distinguish who was who. Judging solely from clothing, it was difficult to identify Chairman Mao Zedong from a group of workers or farmers. We saw that New China was implementing a democratic system, and it was democracy in the truest sense of the word.
    On the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, hundreds of millions of Chinese people rejoiced and were encouraged for their country and their leaders. We saw the marching ranks of their army and artillery, saw their jet planes streak across the sky, and also saw the huge ranks of cheering peaceful men and women. We could see their unity, vitality, and lofty spirit. We believe that New China is invincible. In these short two years, New China has increased production, lowered prices, solved the problem of inflation, restored and developed the shattered transportation system, including railways, balanced import and export trade, and achieved a trade surplus. Most importantly, it has distributed land to landless farmers. Chinese friends explained these issues to us, and we studied them carefully. All of this proves the construction genius of China's leaders and the determination and perseverance of the Chinese people. Any country with such leaders and people can be proud of them. From what we have seen, we can be completely confident that New China has no intention—and will not have any intention—of invading other countries. We are confident that New China is one of the greatest pillars of world peace, and China hopes to live in peace with the people of all countries.
    We are also convinced that New China attaches great importance to friendship with India. I assure my Chinese brothers that the people of India are equally filled with friendly feelings towards New China and the Chinese people. India, true to the teachings of its great leader Mahatma Gandhi, has always advocated peace. We firmly believe that the unity and friendship between China and India will be the greatest guarantee of world peace. I hope that this visit of our delegation to China will greatly enhance the development of friendship between our two countries. Such reciprocal visits by delegations will increase. Chinese and Indian universities can regularly exchange students and offer courses for them. At the same time, we can also send delegations of scientists, economists, artists, women, writers, and workers to visit each other. Finally, I earnestly hope that the friendship between India and China will become even closer, thereby contributing to the unity, progress, and prosperity of the people of all countries.
    Long live New China!

### 新中国是世界和平的最伟大的支柱之一

　　新中国是世界和平的最伟大的支柱之一
    印度亲善访华团团长　森德拉尔
    编者按：应邀参加我国国庆节的印度亲善访华团团长、全印和平理事会理事、作家森德拉尔离京之前，应邀在中央人民广播电台演说，该台于十月二十七日播送了他演说的录音。下面就是他的演说词的译文。
    一九五一年九月二十二日的早晨，当我们的船从香港靠近新中国大陆的时候，爆竹的声音，广州港口的装饰和军乐队奏起的军乐声，使我们感觉到盛大的欢迎正等待着我们。从那时候起一直到现在我讲话的时候，我们印度代表团的每一个团员对于中国政府和中国人民对我们的殷勤优厚的款待，都不胜感激。我们就要带着愉快的记忆返回印度了，这个愉快的记忆是永远不会磨灭的。
    我们曾经参观了新中国的公私营企业工厂。我们访问了新中国的大学。我们看到了中国的工人组织、青年组织、妇女组织、合作社和戏剧电影工作的成就。我们还访问了交易市场、大街小巷和农村。我们在任何地方都被各阶层人民对他们的新国家和他们的领袖毛泽东主席的热爱所深深感动。
    新中国在这短短的两年当中，已经解决了为许多国家的领袖或行政首长所无能为力的许多困难的问题。它已经从广大的国土上禁绝了乞丐和娼妓。它已经完全肃清了官吏的腐败现象，而在两年以前，中国的官吏几乎是世界上最腐败的。我们发现在工厂里普通的非技术工人和厂长或者负责人的薪津相差很小。在广州一个规模很大的广东造纸厂里，最低工资和最高工资之间的比例是三比八。在北京的一个工厂，一个普通女工每月工资是二百五十斤小米，厂长的工资是三百五十斤小米。我们看到了几乎所有的新中国的公教职员，从最高级到最低级，都是用小米计算薪津，而不是用纸币。政府部长的服装同大学校长或是普通职员或是工厂工人的服装实际上没有什么区别。一眼望去，很难立刻分辨出谁是谁。仅仅从服装来看，就很难从一群工人或者农民中间辨认出毛泽东主席。我们看到新中国正实行着民主制度，并且是最名符其实的民主制度。
    在中华人民共和国建国二周年的那一天，千百万中国人民为他们的国家和领袖而欢腾鼓舞。我们看见了他们的陆军和炮兵部队前进的行列，看见了他们的喷气式飞机划空而过，并且也看见了欢呼着的和平的男人和妇女的巨大的队伍。我们能够看到他们的团结一致、活泼愉快和崇高的精神。我们相信新中国是无敌的。在这短短的两年当中，新中国怎样增加了生产，降低了物价，解决了通货膨胀的难题，恢复并且发展了包括铁道在内的已经支离破碎了的运输系统，平衡了进出口贸易并且达到了出超，最重要的是把土地分给了没有土地的农民；关于这些问题，中国朋友给我们做了解释，我们也仔细地研究过。所有这些都证明了中国领袖们的建设天才和中国人民的决心和毅力，任何国家能有这样的领袖和人民都是要引以自豪的。从我们所看到的这些事情里面，可以使我们完全相信：新中国没有——也不会有侵略其他国家的打算。我们敢肯定新中国是世界和平的最伟大的支柱之一，中国希望和世界各国人民和平相处。
    我们也确信：新中国是非常重视印度的友谊的。我向我的中国弟兄们保证：印度人民对新中国和中国人民是同样充满了友谊的感情的。印度忠实于它的伟大领袖圣雄——甘地的教训，一直拥护和平。我们深信中国和印度的团结和友谊，将是世界和平的最大保障。我希望我们代表团的这次访问中国，将会大为增进我们两国友谊的发展。像这样的互相访问的代表团将会增加。中国和印度的大学可以定期交换学生并且为他们开设课程。同时，我们也可以派遣科学家、经济学家、艺术家、妇女、文学家和工人的代表团互相访问。最后，我热切地希望印度和中国的友谊将能愈加亲密，从而有助于世界各国人民的团结、进步和繁荣。
    新中国万岁！
