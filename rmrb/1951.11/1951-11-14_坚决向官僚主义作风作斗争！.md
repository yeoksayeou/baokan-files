Resolutely Struggle Against Bureaucratic Work Style!
　　Editor's note: The sloppy and procrastinating bureaucratic work style of some state organ personnel, and their lack of enthusiasm and responsibility towards the interests of the masses, can affect, or even determine, the happiness, suffering, fortunes, and misfortunes of the people, and even their lives and deaths. The letters published here today fully demonstrate the harm that bureaucratic work styles cause to the people's interests. Therefore, we must constantly wage a serious struggle against this kind of bureaucratic work style, constantly expose and criticize it, and continuously improve our work in all aspects.
　　The Wutai County People's Government Is Indifferent to the Murder of Women
　　The People's Government of Wutai County, Shanxi Province, does not attach importance to marriage issues, and takes a particularly indifferent attitude towards cases of abuse and murder of women. Although the county has resolved more than 160 marriage cases (including annulments) in the past year or so, it has always been passive. For example, Wu Xiaonv from Shahe, Fanshi County, and her fiancé from Wutai requested to terminate their engagement. Despite three urgings from the Fanshi County People's Government, the Wutai County People's Government ignored them. Wu Xiaonv went to the Wutai County People's Government twice to request action, and it took more than eight months to resolve the matter. Another example is that Qu Erquan's wife repeatedly requested a divorce but was not granted it, resulting in her being brutally murdered by Qu Erquan (Qu has been executed by firing squad). Such tragic events have not attracted the county's attention. As of the end of August, the county still had 61 pending cases, with an average of 22 cases per month that had been backlogged for three to six months or more. From January to September of this year, the county had 19 cases of suicide and murder (16 of which were women), but the County People's Government never reported them to higher authorities, nor did they handle them in a timely manner. They did not properly examine the bodies, and sometimes just asked the district cadres to take a simple look and that was it. Fang Shutang (who served in the Yan Xishan bandit army) of Dongyan Town, Fourth District, Wutai County, consistently threatened and abused his wife, Bo Yuxian. Unable to bear it any longer, Bo filed for divorce last December. After the county ruled for divorce, Fang Shutang superficially pretended to repent, used tricks, and applied for remarriage. The district government did not carefully consider the matter and approved the remarriage. After the remarriage, on September 16, the criminal Fang Shutang took advantage of Bo Yuxian and her mother going to sweep the grave, and killed Bo Yuxian with a sheep-slaughtering knife. Bo's uncle and younger brother were also killed on the spot. Bo Yuxian had fifteen wounds on her head and one on her hand; her uncle Bo Wenyuan had five wounds, and her younger brother had one wound. The county did not promptly report this reactionary crime of deliberately killing Bo Yuxian's entire family and undermining the marriage policy, which caused widespread dissatisfaction among the masses. It is clear that the Wutai County People's Government has adopted an indifferent attitude towards cases of abuse and murder of women, which is serious bureaucracy. The leading cadres of Wutai County should conduct a thorough self-examination and respond in the newspaper.

　　Zhuang, Clerk of the Neihuang County Judicial Section, Delays Handling of Chao Zeng'e's Divorce Case Again and Again
　　Editor: When the Central People's Government Old Revolutionary Base Area Visiting Group arrived in Jingdian Town, Neihuang County, Pingyuan Province, Chao Zeng'e, a young woman from Chao Xiaozhai in the county's Sixth District, and her mother ran more than a dozen miles to file a complaint.
　　Chao Zeng'e said sadly: "I am twenty-two years old this year. I married Sun Qiuhe of Sun Xiaozhai when I was fifteen; he is eight years older than me, and we have never had a good relationship since we got married. When I got to his house, I was either beaten or scolded. He would press my head with his leg, beat me with hemp rope, and beat me with a broom. I really couldn't go on. On March 29 of this year, I went to the district to complain, and the district told me to go to the county. I ran all the way to the county, sixty miles from my home, to find Zhuang, a clerk in the judicial section, to complain. Clerk Zhuang wrote a summons and told me to summon my husband. I went to summon him, once, twice, running back and forth more than a thousand li, and only saw Clerk Zhuang twice. Once, the judgment was: 'Divorce is allowed, but she is not allowed to take the land.' I disagreed and went to the judicial section again, but no one would see me. I went to the county government once and waited, sometimes for four days, sometimes for seven days. I came so many times that Clerk Zhuang got annoyed and said: 'The more times you come, the less I will ask.' I was heartbroken and didn't eat for four days. Wang Xuelian, a member of the county women's federation, found me a place to live. Comrade Xuelian asked a correspondent to ask, and Clerk Zhuang said: 'It's nothing to do with me if she doesn't eat for eight days. I'll ask if I want to.' When I heard that he wouldn't ask, I wanted to appeal, but Clerk Zhuang said: 'You can't appeal until this is cleared up.' After going home, I thought: 'When will it end? The county won't ask, and they won't let me appeal.' I had no way out and tried to hang myself, but the villagers saved me and advised me to appeal. I heard you were coming, so I came to talk."
　　According to the masses, Sun Qiuhe has consistently bullied Chao Zeng'e, while Clerk Zhuang has repeatedly delayed Chao Zeng'e's divorce case. Wang Xuelian, a member of the county women's federation, and comrades from the county party committee, all said that Clerk Zhuang is irresponsible in his work, does not accept leadership, and delays many similar cases again and again. It is hoped that the local government will quickly investigate and deal with this matter.

　　Judicial Departments in the Central and Southern Region Do Not Approve Major Cases in Dengfeng County in a Timely Manner
　　Editor: In the past year, there have been many bloody incidents in our Dengfeng County (mostly cases of women being victimized). Most of these incidents have been dealt with in our county, but some major cases (i.e., those involving the death penalty) are beyond our authority to decide and must be referred to higher authorities (such as general criminal cases where the death penalty is to be imposed, which must be approved by the judicial organs at the Central and Southern Region level). However, the approval of these cases by the relevant leading organs in the Central and Southern Region is not timely enough. For example, the cases of Zhu Yun, a murderer involved in an affair, Jing Lishi (female), an abuser, and Du Chunfang, all of whom the People's Government of our county requested the death penalty for on April 8 of this year, have been pending for more than half a year since the request was made, and there has been no news. We have also repeatedly requested and urged the Zhengzhou Branch of the Henan Provincial People's Court, and according to the comrades in charge of the court, they have also sent official letters three or four times to urge the approval of these cases, but no response has been received. We do not know whether the relevant leading organs in the Central and Southern Region have studied these cases, or whether they have forgotten about them. The county women's federation and the masses are very dissatisfied with the delayed handling of these cases and have repeatedly raised objections to the county people's government. Therefore, we suggest that the Central and Southern Branch of the Supreme People's Court and the Central and Southern Ministry of Justice should quickly investigate and handle these cases and approve them as soon as possible, so that the problems can be resolved as soon as possible.

　　Editor's note: This newspaper inquired with the Central and Southern Branch of the Supreme People's Court about the handling of the cases mentioned in the letter from comrades Tang Bingqian, etc. According to a letter from the branch, the Du Chunfang case has been completed and sent out on October 11, except for the Jing Lishi abuse case which has not been received. The Zhu Yun murder case is currently under review. It is also stated that the above two cases were received on July 12.

### 坚决向官僚主义作风作斗争！

　　坚决向官僚主义作风作斗争！
    编者按：某些国家机关中的工作人员，在工作中的潦草、拖延，对群众利益缺乏热情和责任心的官僚主义作风，都会影响甚至决定人民的苦乐祸福和生死。今天这里发表的几件来信，充分说明了官僚主义作风对人民利益的危害。因此，我们必须经常地向这种官僚主义作风作严肃的斗争，经常地加以揭发和批评，不断改进我们各方面的工作。
    五台县人民政府对虐杀妇女事件漠不关心
    山西省五台县人民政府不重视婚姻问题，特别对虐杀妇女事件采取漠不关心的态度。该县一年多以来虽解决了一百六十多件婚姻案件（包括解除婚约的），但始终是被动的。如繁峙县砂河武小女与五台的未婚夫要求解除婚约，经繁峙县人民政府三次催促，五台县人民政府都置之不理，武小女又两次到五台县人民政府要求，时经八个多月才得到解决。又如曲二全之妻再三要求离婚，得不到解决，结果被曲二全惨杀（曲已被枪决）。这样的惨痛事件，却未引起该县的注意。该县至八月底还有未结案件六十一件，三至六月以上的积压案件每月平均二十二件，今年一至九月该县曾发生自杀与被杀命案十九件
    （其中十六件是妇女），县人民政府从未向上级报告，也不及时处理，对尸体不很好检验，有时只托区干部简单地看一下就算了事。该县第四区东沿镇方树堂（曾当过阎匪军）对其妻薄玉仙一贯威胁虐待，薄受气不过，于去年十二月提出离婚，经县判决离婚后，方树堂表面上假装改悔，玩弄手段，又申请复婚。区政府没有慎重考虑，准其复婚。婚后，九月十六日，凶犯方树堂乘薄玉仙与其母上坟之际，以杀羊刀杀害薄玉仙，当场薄之叔父及胞弟等人亦被凶杀。薄玉仙头部伤十五处，手部一处，其叔薄文元伤五处，其弟伤一处。这种蓄意杀死薄玉仙全家，破坏婚姻政策的反动罪行，该县仍不及时报告，以致引起群众纷纷不满。很显然，五台县人民政府对虐杀妇女案采取的是漠不关心的态度，这是严重的官僚主义。五台县领导干部应很好的作检查，并望在报纸上答复。

    内黄县司法科庄科员处理晁增娥离婚案一拖再拖
    编辑同志：当中央人民政府老根据地访问团到平原省内黄县井店镇的时候，该县六区晁小砦青年妇女晁增娥和她母亲跑了十几里路来告状。
    晁增娥很痛心地诉说：“我今年二十二岁。我十五岁就和孙小砦的孙秋合结婚；他比我大八岁，结婚后感情就不好。我到他家，不是挨打就是挨骂。他用腿压住我的头，用麻绳打，用扫帚打。我实在过不下去。今年三月二十九日，我到区告状，区叫我到县。我又一气跑到离家六十里的县里找司法科庄科员告状。庄科员写传票叫我去传我的丈夫。我去传了，一次，两次，连跑了九次，来回一千多里，只见了庄科员两次面。有一次判决：‘允许离婚，但不允许带土地。’我不同意，再找司法科，就无人见面了。我到县政府一次等一次，有等四天的时候，有等七天的时候。我来的趟数多，庄科员烦了，他说：‘愈趟多愈不问。’我心里难过，四天没吃饭。县妇联委员王雪莲给我找房子住下，雪莲同志让通讯员去问，庄科员说：‘她八天不吃饭都与我没关系。我愿问就问。’我听说他不问了，我要上告，庄科员说：‘这里弄不清不能上告。’回家后我想：‘什么时候是头？县里不问，又不叫上告。’我走头无路去上吊，村里人把我救下来，劝我上告。我听说你们来了，我来说说。”
    据群众反映，孙秋合一贯欺负晁增娥，而庄科员却对晁增娥离婚案一拖再拖。该县妇联委员王雪莲同志和县委同志都说，该庄科员对工作不负责任，不接受领导，对许多类似的案件都一拖再拖。希望当地政府迅速检查处理。

    中南区司法部门对登封县重大案件批复不及时
    编辑同志：我们登封县近一年来曾发生了不少的流血事件（大部是妇女被害）。这些事件，大部已在我县作了处理，但有些重大案件（即判死刑的），因为权限问题，我们不能决定，必须请示上级（如一般刑事案件判处死刑者需经中南区一级司法机关批准）。但中南有关领导机关对这些案件的批复却太不及时了。如我县人民政府于今年四月八日呈请判处死刑的奸情杀人犯朱运、虐杀犯景李氏（女）、杜春芳等三案，从呈请迄今已半年多了，仍毫无音信。我们也曾数次请示催促河南省人民法院郑州分院，据该院负责同志谈，他们也已先后上行公函三、四次，催请这些案件的批复，但始终未见一信。我们不知中南有关领导机关是否对这些案件作了研究，不知是否把这些案件忘掉了？我县妇联及群众对这些案件的拖延处理非常不满，曾多次向县人民政府提出意见。因此，我们建议最高人民法院中南分院及中南司法部应赶快检查处理这些案件，早日批复，以使问题早日得到解决。

    编者按：本报曾为唐秉谦等同志来信所提的案件，向最高人民法院中南分院询问处理情形，据该分院来信称：除景李氏虐杀案未收到外，杜春芳案已经办毕，于十月十一日发出，朱运奸情杀人案，则正在核办中。并称以上二案都是在七月十二日收到的。
