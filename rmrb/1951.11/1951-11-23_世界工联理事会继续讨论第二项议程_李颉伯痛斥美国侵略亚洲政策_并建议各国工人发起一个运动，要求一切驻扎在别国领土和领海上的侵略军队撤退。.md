Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 22nd. Li Jiebo, the representative of China attending the Berlin meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council, stated on the 18th during the discussion of the second agenda item, "The Unity of the Working People in the Struggle to Improve Living Conditions and Oppose the Economic and Social Consequences of the Arms Race Policy," that this report and the speech by Soviet representative Kuznetsov pointed out to the working class of the world, especially the working class of Asian colonial and semi-colonial countries, the path to victory in their daily struggles. If the workers of these countries can unite and unite all possible forces to wage a resolute struggle for bread, independence, and democracy, and against imperialist aggression, then they will surely achieve victory in the struggle.

Li Jiebo then strongly denounced the arms expansion and war preparations of the imperialist bloc headed by the United States and its policy of open aggression in Asia. He said that the brutal crimes and cruel oppression and exploitation of the imperialist aggressors have aroused the anger and resistance of the Asian people. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers resolutely resist the aggression of U.S. imperialism. The people of Vietnam, Malaya, and the Philippines are heroically fighting the imperialist aggressors. The large-scale struggle against aggression launched by the people of Asia and North Africa has dealt a heavy blow to the imperialist aggressors. With the great strength of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and the sympathy and support of peace-loving people all over the world, they have achieved or are achieving various successes.

Li Jiebo concluded by saying that the Chinese working class firmly supports the resolutions of the Second World Peace Council and the proposals put forward by Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky at the Sixth UN General Assembly and will strive for their realization. We propose that the working class of all countries launch a movement demanding the withdrawal of all aggressor troops from the battlefield and the withdrawal of all aggressor troops stationed on the territory and territorial waters of other countries.
