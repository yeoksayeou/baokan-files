Party Life

　　Should Communist Party members formulate patriotic pledges? Our answer is: Communist Party members should not only formulate and implement patriotic pledges, but should also become models in formulating and implementing patriotic pledges.

　　Patriotic pledges are a great creation of the people in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend the country. After being concentrated by the leading organs, patriotic pledges have become a good way to organize people of all strata to carry out various tasks, and one of the most important ways to organize the masses to conduct self-education and self-transformation.

　　In order to promote the advancement of various construction undertakings, local Party committees must adopt various effective methods to publicize to the people and transform the Party's propositions into the actual actions of the people. Patriotic pledges are one of the important methods for organizing the masses to carry out various construction undertakings. Therefore, local Party committees should attach great importance to patriotic pledges and seriously and conscientiously lead the people to formulate and implement them. The experience of the past year has proved that in places where the Party committee pays attention to leading this work, the awareness of the people has been greatly improved, various construction undertakings have been greatly developed, and the Party's prestige among the masses has also increased accordingly.

　　How should the Party committee lead this work? One of the important ways is to unite the people through all Party members to jointly formulate and implement patriotic pledges. In the mass movement to revise patriotic pledges, Party organizations must mobilize all Party members to play an exemplary role, and Party members and cadres must work with the masses to jointly implement patriotic pledges, correcting the erroneous view of some Party members or cadres that patriotic pledges are only pledges for the general masses. However, some local Party members and cadres do not recognize and act in this way, but say that "Communist Party members already have their own Party program and constitution, so there is no need to formulate patriotic pledges," and even say that "formulating patriotic pledges is lowering the level and role of Party members," which is of course very wrong. Communist Party members formulating and implementing patriotic pledges together with the people will not only not "lower the level and role of Party members," but on the contrary, this is an important way to give full play to the role of Party members. Because through the backbone role of Party members in the patriotic pledge movement, the Party's propositions can be naturally transformed into the specific actions of the people, so that the connection between the Party and the people can be further strengthened. Therefore, Party members who actively participate in the patriotic pledge movement should be encouraged; and those Party members who only stand outside the patriotic pledge movement and do not actively participate in formulating patriotic pledges should be severely criticized.

　　共产党员应否制订和执行爱国公约
    共产党员应当不应当制订爱国公约呢？我们的答复是：共产党员不仅应当制订和执行爱国公约，并且应当成为制订和执行爱国公约的模范。
    爱国公约是人民群众在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中的伟大创造。经过领导机关的集中，爱国公约已成为组织各阶层人民进行各项工作的良好形式，成为组织人民群众进行自我教育和自我改造的最重要的形式之一。
    各地党委为了推动各项建设事业的前进，必须采用各种有效的方法，向人民群众进行宣传，把党的主张变为人民群众的实际行动。爱国公约正是组织群众进行各项建设事业的重要方法之一。所以各地党委应当十分重视爱国公约，并严肃认真地领导人民制订和执行爱国公约。一年来的经验证明，凡是党委注意领导这一工作的地方，那里的人民群众的觉悟也就大大提高，各项建设事业也就有着很大的发展，党在群众中的威信也就随之提高。
    党委应当怎样来领导这一工作呢？重要的方式之一，就是通过全体党员去团结人民群众，一同制订和执行爱国公约。在群众性的修订爱国公约的运动中，党的组织要动员全体党员起模范作用，党员和干部要同群众在一起共同执行爱国公约，纠正某些党员或干部认为爱国公约只是一般群众的公约的错误看法。但是，有些地方的党员和干部，却不是这样去认识和这样去作的，而说什么“共产党员已有自己的党纲党章，不必再订爱国公约”，甚至说“订立爱国公约是降低党员的水平和作用”，这当然是十分错误的。共产党员同人民群众在一起制订和执行爱国公约，不但不会“降低党员的水平和作用”，恰恰相反，这正是充分发挥党员作用的重要方法。因为通过党员在爱国公约运动中的骨干作用，即可把党的主张很自然地变为人民群众的具体行动，这样，就能够进一步加强党与人民群众的联系。因此，凡是积极参加爱国公约运动的党员，都应该受到鼓励；而那些只站在爱国公约运动之外不去积极参加订爱国公约的党员，应该受到严厉批评。
