    Circular of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee on Fully Launching the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement
    October 22, 1951

    (1)
    The increase production and practice economy movement launched in the state-owned and public-owned factories and mines in Northeast China has achieved great success due to the active efforts of leading cadres, technicians, management personnel, and workers. The main manifestations are: First, the political awareness of the employees has been greatly improved. In the movement, from the formulation of plans to the implementation of plans, the political and economic significance of increase production and practice economy was repeatedly explained, criticism and self-criticism were carried out, and the ideological understanding of leading cadres and employees was corrected. The broad masses of employees recognized that the increase production and practice economy movement is a reliable path to develop industry, consolidate national defense, strive for the final victory in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and build a better future life. Therefore, after the movement was launched, the enthusiasm, creativity, and unity shown by workers in production were unprecedented. Zhu Yuxian, a lathe operator at the Shenyang 53 Factory, had previously taught five apprentices, but had not passed on his best skills to them. However, in this movement, he taught his new apprentice. A female worker in a textile factory cried sadly because she had done a bad job. A worker at the Machine Six Factory was dreaming of finding tricks at night. Li Fumi, a worker at a factory in Qiqihar City, said with emotion after calculating the detailed accounts: "If Chairman Gao Gang's call for increase production and practice economy had come a year later, I don't know how much wealth we would have wasted for the country!" Workers in the forging workshop of the Fushun Machine Repair Factory wrote to Comrade Gao Gang: "When we strike a hammer and burn a piece of iron, we think about being responsible to the country." Workers in the Anshan Refining Factory, who had previously left eighty-seven tools in the ditch, also made self-criticisms in the movement and took out the tools. Employees in many factories in Shenyang, from teams and groups to individuals, have prepared "gift books" for increase production and practice economy, recording the achievements of increase production and practice economy every day, ready to present gifts to Chairman Mao and Chairman Gao Gang at any time. The broad masses of workers are also greatly enthusiastic about learning technology and culture in order to complete their increase production and practice economy plans. More than 1,400 people from the Shenyang Smelting Plant participated in technical and cultural studies. Due to the increased awareness of employees, a mass movement of using their brains, finding tricks, and tapping potential with rationalization proposals was launched in many factories and mines. The masses of five state-owned machine factories in Shenyang put forward and implemented 235 rationalization proposals and tricks, thus overcoming many difficulties in production and ensuring the completion and exceeding of the increase production and practice economy plan.
    Second, leading cadres, technicians, and staff of the party, administration, trade union, and youth league of factories and mines took the initiative and planned to go deep into the workshops to study the key problems in production. In this way, on the one hand, the leading cadres further understand the many major problems in the workshops and production process and the ideological situation of the employees, which is convenient for guiding the development of the movement; on the other hand, it combines the scientific and technological knowledge of the technicians with the practical operating experience of the workers, and the economic knowledge of the financial management personnel with the patriotic ideology of the employees, thus solving many major problems that have not been solved in the past. As a result of the combination of technicians, financial management personnel, and workers in the Shenyang Smelting Plant, employees put forward more than a thousand rationalization proposals in the third quarter, and new technical and economic records appeared eleven times in August, and twelve new overall records appeared in September, creating huge wealth for the country. The plant's annual task of increasing production and practicing economy by 115,976 tons was exceeded by 7 per thousand by the end of September. The Anshan Chemical Department solved the problem of asphalt quality that had not been solved since the puppet Manchurian regime; the equipment efficiency of the sintering plant during the puppet Manchurian regime was only 1,400 tons, but it has been increased to 2,500 tons in the movement, and the quality has also been improved; the small plant improved the feeding channel inside the heating furnace and increased the gas nozzle at the bottom of the furnace, which increased the temperature in the furnace, from 800 tons per furnace in the past to 1,400 tons, and the quality has also been improved, and the ability of rail steel has been greatly improved. Most of the twenty-seven problems accumulated by the Dalian Glass Factory for many years have also been solved.
    Third, the operation and management of enterprises have been improved and enhanced. Anshan Iron and Steel Company did not establish a raw material reserve and ordering system in the past. In the movement, it established a raw material reserve, use, and ordering system, and processed 65 billion yuan of stagnant and excessive reserve materials. Most of the factories and mines under the company have established a system that requires workshops to submit orders for raw materials in advance, which are reviewed by the planning and financial departments and transferred to the materials department for ordering, which has changed the phenomenon that the material department's preparation of supply plans and ordering of raw materials were separated from the workshops in the past. In the case of old machine tool equipment, Machine One Factory divided the parts of the product into four categories: main, standard, precision, and general. According to the process requirements of each type of part, it organized joint groups of various machine tools. Then, based on the principle of setting machines, setting tasks, and setting people, it organized a production management organization to replace the unreasonable production organization in the past, which purely organized classes and groups based on machine types and assigned production based on one process. It greatly improved labor productivity, increased output, improved product quality, and opened up the road for improving the productivity of the machine industry.
    Fourth, the comprehensive result of the above characteristics is the huge increase and accumulation of national wealth. From January to August, the factories and mines under the Ministry of Industry have increased production and practiced economy by 4,267,714 tons of grain for the country in addition to completing the original plan. Among them, accelerating the turnover of funds saved 2,035,406 tons, accounting for 47.7%, the total value of increased production was 1,147,249 tons, accounting for 26.8%, and the cost reduction was 1,085,059 tons, accounting for 25.5%. Comparing the above figures with the first half of the year and July and August, there has been a great increase after the launch of the increase production and practice economy movement. For example, the savings from accelerating the turnover of funds increased by 6.8% in July and 21.5% in August, based on the average of January to June; the total value of increased production also increased by 1.06% in July and 13.33% in August, based on the average of January to June; the cost reduction rate was 6.2% from January to June, 7.54% in July, and 8.84% in August. Of the 38 major products of the factories and mines under the Ministry of Industry, 35 exceeded the national production plan in September. The 14 state-owned factories in Shenyang had exceeded 10% of the tasks assigned by the higher-level enterprise organs by the end of September; the increase production and practice economy tasks completed by five factories in September alone were equal to one-third of the total completed in the previous eight months.
    In short, the increase production and practice economy movement has become a driving force for promoting work. This movement has promoted the improvement of the overall work of factories and mines, and the appearance of factories and mines has been renewed.

    (2)
    However, the imbalance in the movement still exists. From the perspective of departments, the factories and mines under the Ministry of Industry are better than the factories and mines under other departments; from the perspective of regions, cities such as Shenyang, Fushun, and Anshan are better. From the analysis of existing materials, the state-owned and public-owned factories and mines in the entire region can be divided into four types:

    The first type is that the increase production and practice economy plan has been completed (some have exceeded) or will be completed soon. There are two situations in this type of factory and mine: one is that at the beginning of the movement, the leading cadres repeatedly studied and researched the relevant documents and instructions on increase production and practice economy, understood its spiritual essence, explained the significance and guidelines to all employees, relied on the masses, mobilized the masses, and tapped potential. On this basis, they formulated advanced and feasible plans, and vigorously carried out mass rationalization proposals and trick-finding movements, and organized competition movements. The leading cadres of the factory department, section, share, and workshop formulated specific measures to enable the lower levels to complete their tasks based on the plans of the team, group, and individual, and guided the development of the movement in a planned manner. This type of factory and mine not only completed and exceeded the increase production and practice economy plan, but also, due to the improvement of mass awareness and the active initiative of leading cadres, organically combined with other work in the movement, so that other work in the factory and mine was also completed smoothly. Such as smelting plants, 53 plants, etc. However, there are also a few units that have completed their tasks because they have not fully mobilized the masses and the original plan or the plan set this time is relatively backward and conservative. For example, the annual increase production and practice economy plan of the Electrical Engineering Six Factory is 1,000 tons, but it completed 1,144 tons in August.

    The second type is that the plans of the factory department, workshop, team, and group have been set, and the masses have been initially mobilized, and the increase production and practice economy plan has completed a considerable number. The main characteristic of this type of factory and mine is that it took a detour at the beginning, and after learning (including learning relevant documents and advanced experience of advanced factories and mines), it re-mobilized the masses and caught up. This type of factory and mine accounts for a certain number and is increasing day by day.

    The third type is that the factory and mine workshops have set plans, but the masses have not been fully mobilized, and some of the team and group plans have not yet been set. The main characteristics of this type of factory and mine are that the leading cadres of the enterprise do not have a clear mass viewpoint, emphasize difficulties, are ideologically conservative, and do not pay attention to learning or do not learn advanced experience; the management system and work foundation are poor.

    The fourth type is that there is only a plan for the factory department, but the plan has not yet left the office of the factory director or section chief, and the masses have not been mobilized at all; some even have no plan at all. Among the above four types, the second and third types are the majority, the first and fourth types are the minority, and the fourth type is mostly small enterprises and institutions operated by provinces and cities and agencies.

    (3)
    Increase production and practice economy is an extremely important link for us to accumulate capital, develop production, consolidate national defense, and industrialize the country. The development of the increase production and practice economy movement can promote the improvement and enhancement of various tasks; therefore, continuing to deeply, comprehensively, and persistently carry out this movement is the established policy of the entire party in Northeast China and must be vigorously continued. This movement should not only be carried out in the industrial and production departments, but also in all departments in Northeast China, including finance, trade, cooperation, culture and education, schools, and other government departments. The focus of the financial and economic departments in carrying out this movement is to improve business skills, improve business management, eliminate corruption and waste, and create and accumulate more wealth for the country; the focus of other non-production agencies and schools in carrying out this movement is to streamline institutions, improve work efficiency, save expenses, oppose corruption and waste, and oppose bureaucratic work style, so as to create and save wealth for the country in all aspects. All of the above departments should learn from the experience of state-owned factories and mines in carrying out this movement, combine it with the specific conditions of their own departments (currently, the main thing is to combine it with the anti-corruption, degeneration, extravagance and waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle carried out by various agencies), formulate plans for increase production and practice economy and improve work efficiency, and carry out this movement in a led and organized manner.

    In the state-owned and public-owned factories and mines, a steady development policy should be adopted, and different requirements should be put forward according to the different conditions of the factories and mines, and this movement should be continued in depth. In the first type of factories and mines, the masses may have slackening thoughts, and cadres may have complacent emotions, and the leadership must prevent them. The central task of this type of factory and mine is to continue to mobilize the masses, rely on and pass through the masses, put forward new excess plans, and strive to create more wealth for the country. The second type of factories and mines must seriously learn from the experience of the first type of factories and mines, promote the contract system and patriotic conventions, organize competitions, launch mass trick-finding and rationalization proposal movements, and strive to complete or exceed the plan ahead of schedule; prevent the emergence of formalism that thinks everything is fine and does not supervise or inspect. The third type of factories and mines should quickly implement the plan into the workshops, teams, and groups, and mobilize the masses to set up specific plans to complete the plan from the bottom up; leading cadres should lead technical and cost personnel to go deep into the workshops and work with the workers to tap potential, set plans, and find tricks. The fourth type of enterprise should first organize cadres to study documents, understand the significance of increase production and practice economy, overcome ideological obstacles, mobilize the masses, tap potential, set plans, and take action. Secondly, for units where the masses have already been mobilized and the workshop, team, and group plans have been set, the focus of work should be placed on the workshop; the focus of work in the workshop is to strengthen technical management, that is, to revise and formulate technical operating procedures through repeated discussions by employees, and to consolidate the results of quality inspection. Furthermore, in order to develop and consolidate this movement, all factories and mines should vigorously promote the piece-rate wage system, and in units where conditions are not available, the excess reward system should also be implemented. Various inventions, creations, and rationalization proposals of the masses must be rewarded in a timely manner. At the same time, the current movement must also be linked to patriotic education, especially patriotic conventions, so as to better inspire the enthusiasm of the masses and make the movement develop more fully.

    中共中央东北局关于全面展开增产节约运动的通报
    一九五一年十月二十二日
    （一）
    东北国公营厂矿企业中所开展的增产节约运动，由于领导干部、技术人员、管理人员与工人群众的积极努力，均已获得极大的成绩。其主要表现是：一、职工群众的政治觉悟大大地提高。在运动中，从制订计划到贯彻计划，由于反复地进行了增产节约的政治意义与经济意义的教育，开展了批评与自我批评，端正了领导干部与职工的思想认识，广大职工群众认识了增产节约运动是发展工业，巩固国防，争取抗美援朝的最后胜利与建设未来更加美好的生活的可靠道路；因此，运动开展后，工人在生产上所表现的积极性、创造性、团结性为空前所未有。沈阳五三厂车工朱玉先过去带过五个徒弟，都未将自己最好的技术传教他们，但在此运动中，教给了新的徒弟；某纺织厂的女工因为做坏了活，伤心地痛哭起来；机器六厂一个工友夜间做梦也在找窍门；齐齐哈尔市某厂工友李福密在算细账之后感动地说：“高岗主席增产节约的号召再晚一年，不知咱们又给国家浪费多少财富！”抚顺机修厂锻造车间工人给高岗同志的信上说：“打一鎯头，烧一块铁，都想到对国家负责。”鞍山精制厂工友过去把八十七件工具丢在地沟里不管，在运动中也作了检讨，并将工具取出。沈阳许多工厂中的职工从班组到个人，都备有增产节约的献礼本，每天记录着增产节约的成绩，随时准备向毛主席、高岗主席献礼。广大的工人群众为了完成自己的增产节约计划，学习技术、文化的热情也大大地提高。沈阳冶炼厂即有一千四百多人参加技术文化学习。由于职工的觉悟提高，许多厂矿中开展了群众性的动脑筋、找窍门、挖潜力的合理化建议运动。沈阳五个国营机器工厂群众提出并实现了的合理化建议与窍门即达二百三十五件，因而克服了生产上的许多困难问题，保证完成与超过了增产节约计划。
    二、厂矿企业党、行政、工会、青年团的领导干部、技术人员、职员，主动而有计划地深入车间，研究生产中的关键问题。这样，一方面使领导干部进一步了解车间与生产过程中的许多重大问题与职工的思想情况，便于指导运动的开展；另方面使技术人员的科学技术与工人的实际操作经验结合，使财务管理人员的经济知识与职工的爱国主义思想结合，从而解决了许多重大而又为过去所没有解决的问题。沈阳冶炼厂技术人员、财务管理人员与工人结合的结果，三季度职工提出千余条合理化建议，八月份出现了十一次技术、经济上的新纪录，九月份又出现十二次全体新纪录，给国家创造了巨大财富。该厂全年增产节约十一万五千九百七十六吨的任务，九月底已超过计划的千分之七。鞍山化工部解决了从伪满以来一直未解决的柏油质量问题；烧结厂伪满时的设备效率仅为一千四百吨，在运动中已提高至二千五百吨，质量亦有提高；小型厂改进了加热炉内部的送料道，增加炉底瓦斯烧咀，使炉内温度增高，由过去每炉烧八百吨提高到一千四百吨，质量亦有提高，并大大地提高了轨钢的能力。大连玻璃厂多少年以来积累未解决的二十七个问题，也大部解决了。
    三、改善与提高了企业的经营管理。鞍山钢铁公司，过去没有建立原材料储备、订购制度，在运动中建立了原材料储备使用订购制度，并处理了六百五十亿元的呆滞与超额储备材料。该公司所属大部厂矿建立了订购原材料必须事先由车间提出，经计划、财务部门审核，转材料部门订购的制度，转变了过去材料部门编制供应计划与订购原材料和车间脱节的现象。机器一厂在旧有机床设备的情况下，把产品的部件分成主要、标准、精密与一般四类，按每类部件工序要求，组织各种机床混编的联合小组，再以定机器、定任务、定人的原则，组织生产管理组织，代替过去纯以机器种类编班组、以一道工序为主分配生产的不合理的生产组织，大大地提高了劳动生产率，增加了产量，改善了产品质量，并给机器工业生产力的提高开辟了道路。
    四、上述特点的综合结果，就是国家财富的巨大增加与积累。工业部所属厂矿一至八月，在完成原定的计划之外，已为国家增产节约四百二十六万七千七百一十四吨粮食。其中加速资金周转节约二百零三万五千四百零六吨，占百分之四十七点七，增产总值一百一十四万七千二百四十九吨，占百分之二十六点八，降低成本一百零八万五千零五十九吨，占百分之二十五点五。上述各数若以上半年与七、八月相比，则增产节约运动开展后有极大的增加，如加速资金周转节约，以一至六月的平均数为基数，则七月份提高百分之六点八，八月提高百分之二十一点五；增产总值亦以一至六月的平均数为基数，七月提高百分之一点零六，八月提高百分之十三点三三；成本一至六月降低率为百分之六点二，七月份为百分之七点五四，八月则为百分之八点八四。工业部所属厂矿三十八种主要产品，九月份有三十五种超过了国家生产计划。沈阳十四个国营工厂，九月底已超过上级企业机关分配任务的百分之十；五个工厂九月份一个月完成的增产节约任务，等于前八个月全部完成数的三分之一。
    总之，增产节约运动已成为推动工作前进的动力，这一运动促进了厂矿企业全面工作的改进，使厂矿企业的面貌为之一新。
    （二）
    但运动中的不平衡现象仍然存在。从部门来说，工业部所属厂矿优于其他部门所属厂矿；从地区上看，沈阳、抚顺、鞍山等市较好。从已有的材料分析，全区国公营厂矿企业可分为四种类型：
    第一种，增产节约的计划已完成（有的已超过）或即将完成。这类厂矿又有两种情况：一种是运动开始时，领导干部反复地学习与研究了有关增产节约的文件指示，领会其精神实质，向全体职工说明意义与方针，依靠群众，动员群众，挖掘潜力，在这基础上制订先进而又可行的计划，并大力开展了群众性合理化建议和找窍门运动，组织竞赛运动。厂部、科、股与车间的领导干部根据班、组与个人的计划，制订出为使下级完成任务的具体措施，有计划地指导运动的开展。这类厂矿不仅完成与超过了增产节约的计划，而且由于群众觉悟的提高，领导干部的积极主动，在运动中有机地与其他工作密切结合，使厂矿企业中的其他工作，也顺利地完成。如冶炼厂、五三厂等。但也有少数单位由于发动群众不充分，原来的或这次所订计划均比较落后与保守，因而也完成了任务。如电工六厂全年增产节约计划是一千吨，而八月份即完成一千一百四十四吨。
    第二种，厂部、车间、班、组的计划已订出，并初步地发动了群众，增产节约的计划已完成相当大的数字。这类厂矿的主要特点是开始的时候走了一段弯路，经过学习（包括学习有关文件与先进厂矿的先进经验），重新发动群众，迎头赶上来。这类厂矿占有一定的数量，而且日益增加。
    第三种，厂矿车间已订出计划，但未充分发动群众，班组计划有的还没有。这类厂矿的主要特点，是企业的领导干部群众观点不明确，强调困难，思想保守，不注意学习或不学习先进经验；管理制度与工作基础较差。
    第四种，只有厂部的计划，但计划仍未出厂长或科长的办公室，根本没有发动群众；有的甚至连计划都没有。上述四种类型中，第二、三种类型是多数，第一、四种类型是少数，第四种类型多为省市营与机关经营的小型企业单位。
    （三）
    增产节约是我们积累资本、发展生产、巩固国防、使国家工业化的极为重要的环节，增产节约运动的开展可以推动各种工作的改善与提高；因之，继续深入地全面地长期地开展这一运动，是东北全党既定的方针，必须大力继续贯彻。这一运动不仅在工业与生产部门应该开展，而且在东北所有一切部门，包括财政、贸易、合作、文教、学校与政府其他各部门都要开展起来。财政经济部门开展这一运动的重点，是提高业务水平，改善业务管理，肃清贪污浪费现象，为国家创造与积累更多的财富；其他非生产的机关、学校开展这一运动的重点，是精简机构，提高工作效率，节省开支，反对贪污浪费，反对官僚主义作风，以便从各方面为国家创造与节约财富。上述所有部门都应学习国营厂矿企业开展这一运动的经验，结合本部门的具体情况（目前主要的要结合各机关开展的反贪污蜕化、反铺张浪费与反官僚主义斗争），制订增产节约与提高工作效率的计划，有领导有组织地开展这一运动。
    在国公营厂矿企业中应采取稳步发展的方针，根据目前各厂矿不同的情况，提出不同的要求，继续深入地开展这一运动。在第一类厂矿企业中，群众可能产生松劲思想，干部可能产生自满情绪，领导上必须加以防止。这一类厂矿的中心任务是继续发动群众，依靠与通过群众，提出新的超额计划，争取为国家创造更多的财富。第二类厂矿必须认真学习第一类厂矿的经验，推广合同制与爱国公约，组织竞赛，发动群众性的找窍门与合理化建议运动，争取提前完成或超过计划；防止认为万事大吉，不加督促，不加检查的形式主义的产生。第三类厂矿应迅速地把计划贯彻到车间、班、组中去，发动群众自下而上地订出完成计划的具体计划；领导干部要带领技术、成本人员深入车间，与工人一起挖潜力、订计划、找窍门。第四类企业首先要组织干部学习文件，认识增产节约的意义，克服思想障碍，发动群众，挖掘潜力，定出计划，行动起来。其次，凡是群众已经发动，车间、班、组计划已经定出的单位，应把工作重心放在车间；车间的工作重点则是加强技术管理，即通过职工的反复讨论，修正与制订技术操作规程，把质量检查的成果巩固下来。再次，为了发展与巩固这一运动，所有厂矿企业应大力推行计件工资制，在条件不具备的单位，亦应实行超额奖励制。对群众的各种发明创造与合理化建议，必须及时进行奖励。与此同时，还必须把当前的运动和爱国主义教育，特别是爱国公约联系起来，以便更好地启发群众的积极性，使运动更加饱满地发展。
