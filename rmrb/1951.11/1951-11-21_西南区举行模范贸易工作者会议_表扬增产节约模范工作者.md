    The Trade Department of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee held a meeting of model trade workers from the 8th to the 10th of this month to commend the model workers of the department and various state-owned trade professional companies who have made significant contributions to reducing commodity circulation costs and increasing production and practicing economy in the patriotic emulation campaign.

    Since the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic work emulation campaign in May of this year, the Trade Department of the Southwest Region and various state-owned trade professional companies have saved the state more than 25.7 billion yuan in commodity circulation expenses. In this emulation campaign, more than 250 model workers and a large number of activists emerged. In the Sichuan region, grain transportation mostly relies on wooden boats. In the past, shipwrecks and grain losses during transportation were very serious. Zeng Gequn, the head of the dispatch and transportation section of the Southwest Region Company of the China National Grain Corporation, led all dispatch and transportation staff to organize ships participating in grain transportation to help each other, overcoming the difficulties of the many dangerous shoals of the Sichuan River, and implemented a system of contracted transportation and delivery to eliminate theft by shipowners. As a result, shipwrecks during grain transportation were reduced from an average of 15 per 10,000 in the second half of last year to 2.8 per 10,000 in the first half of this year, saving the state more than 7.22 billion yuan in half a year. The Southwest Region is humid and rainy, and cigarettes are prone to mold. Wei Juncheng, a staff member of the Southwest Region Company of the China National General Merchandise Corporation, passed on his valuable experience of preventing mold in cigarettes and processing moldy cigarettes, accumulated over the past 30 years, to relevant staff, greatly reducing the phenomenon of mold in cigarettes throughout the region. In the past six months, the value of moldy cigarettes processed by him alone reached more than 300 million yuan. Li Daming, a pig bristle packaging worker at the Southwest Region Company of the China National Animal By-Products Corporation, improved his working methods and learned from other workers, increasing the efficiency of pig hair packaging from 3.5 boxes per day to 9 boxes. In addition, his suggestion to carefully remove the packaging paper from opened boxes of hair for reuse was promoted throughout the company, saving more than 39,000 sheets of packaging paper in a month.

    The meeting commended the model deeds of all the model workers and pointed out that the thrift movement should be carried out more deeply in the state-owned trade departments in the future. All the model workers present unanimously pledged that after the meeting, they would continue to unite all employees with model actions, further carry out the patriotic labor emulation campaign, respond to Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy with concrete actions, and implement the instructions of the Central Trade Department and the National Committee of the China National Shop Employees' Union on carrying out the patriotic labor emulation campaign, and strive to further reduce commodity circulation costs.

    西南军政委员会贸易部于本月八日至十日举行模范贸易工作者会议，表扬该部及国营贸易各专业公司在爱国主义竞赛运动中对减低商品流动费用和增产节约有显著贡献的模范工作者。
    西南区贸易部暨国营贸易各专业公司自今年五月份起展开抗美援朝爱国主义工作竞赛以来，已为国家节省了商品流转费用二百五十七亿多元。在这次竞赛运动中涌现出二百五十多个模范工作者和大批积极分子。四川地区粮食调运大多依靠木船，过去调运途中船只失事和粮食耗损情况很严重。中国粮食公司西南区公司调拨运输课课长曾格群领导全体调运工作人员组织参加运粮的船只互相帮助，克服了川江滩多难行的困难，并实行了包运包交的办法，杜绝了船主的偷盗，使运粮船只中途失事事故由去年下半年平均占粮运万分之十五降到今年上半年的万分之二点八，半年来为国家节省七亿二千二百多万元。西南区潮湿多雨，烟卷容易发霉，中国百货公司西南区公司工作人员魏俊成把过去三十年来从事香烟防霉及霉烟加工的宝贵经验传授给有关工作人员，使全区纸烟霉坏现象大为减少，半年来仅经他加工处理好的霉烟价值即达三亿多元。中国畜产公司西南区公司猪鬃包装工人李大明改进了工作方法并与其他工人互教互学，使猪毛包装效率由每天三箱半提高到九箱。此外，由他提出的把开箱的包毛纸细心取下留待下次再用的建议在全公司推广后，一个月内节省了三万九千多张包毛纸。
    这次会议表扬了全体模范工作者的模范事迹，并指出今后在国营贸易部门中应更深入一步开展节约运动。与会全体模范工作者一致提出保证，会后决继续以模范行动，团结全体职工，进一步开展爱国主义劳动竞赛，用具体行动响应毛主席增产节约的号召和贯彻执行中央贸易部及中国店员工会全国委员会关于开展爱国主义劳动竞赛的指示，为进一步降低商品流转费用而奋斗。（新华社）
