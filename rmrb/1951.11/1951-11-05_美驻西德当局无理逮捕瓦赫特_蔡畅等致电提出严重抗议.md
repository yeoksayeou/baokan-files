Xinhua News Agency, November 2nd: Mrs. Lilli Wachter, a member of the "International Women's Investigation Team on the Atrocities of the U.S. and Li Seung-man Troops in Korea," was arrested by the U.S. military authorities in Stuttgart, West Germany, on September 6th for preparing to report the truth about the U.S. aggression in Korea to the West German people. She has recently been unreasonably sentenced to eight months imprisonment and fined 15,000 marks by the U.S. military court in Stuttgart. In response, Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, sent a telegram to U.S. High Commissioner for Germany, McCloy, on October 31st, expressing strong protest and demanding the immediate and unconditional release of Mrs. Wachter. The telegram stated: "Your unreasonable persecution of Mrs. Wachter cannot cover up the truth about the U.S. military's brutal atrocities in Korea. On the contrary, it once again exposes the hideous face of the United States before the people of the world. Therefore, this will only make the German and all peace-loving people of the world hate the U.S. military's atrocities in Korea even more and redouble their determination to oppose the U.S. aggression in Korea and defend world peace." Chairman Cai Chang demanded the immediate release of Mrs. Wachter and the cancellation of the fine, and that she be given full freedom so that she could tell all the truth she had personally witnessed in Korea.

Liu Qingyang, Bai Lang, and Li Keng, the three Chinese members participating in the "International Women's Investigation Team on the Atrocities of the U.S. and Li Seung-man Troops in Korea," also sent a telegram to Otto Wahl, Chairman of the League for the Protection of Human Rights and Freedom in Stuttgart, on the same day, expressing their support for Mrs. Wachter. The letter stated that they were willing to be listed as members of the "Committee to Defend Wachter" organized by the League and would fight with all their might to rescue Mrs. Wachter. They also wrote a letter to Mrs. Wachter, who is now in prison, saying: "You have carried out a selfless struggle for peace and for the happiness of our future generations. We express our infinite respect and extend our cordial greetings to you. All righteous people in the world are supporting you and rescuing you. We wish you an early return to freedom and continue to fight for our common, sacred cause of defending peace."

    美驻西德当局无理逮捕瓦赫特
    蔡畅等致电提出严重抗议
    【新华社二日讯】“国际妇女对朝鲜美李军暴行调查团”团员丽莉·瓦赫特夫人，于九月六日在西德斯图加特因准备向西德人民报告美军侵略朝鲜的真相而被美国军事当局所逮捕，并已于最近为斯图加特美国军事法庭无理判处八个月徒刑和一万五千马克罚款。中华全国民主妇女联合会主席蔡畅为此于十月三十一日致电美国驻德高级专员麦克洛埃提出严重抗议，要求立即无条件释放瓦赫特夫人。电文中说：“你们无理迫害瓦赫特夫人，不但不能掩盖美军在朝鲜所作残酷暴行的真相，相反地，在全世界人民面前再一次暴露了美国的狰狞面目，因此，这只会使德国和全世界一切爱好和平的人民更加痛恨美军在朝鲜的暴行，倍增反对美国侵略朝鲜和保卫世界和平的决心。”蔡畅主席要求立即释放瓦赫特夫人和取消所处罚金，并给予她充分的自由，以便使她能说出她在朝鲜所亲眼看到的一切真实情况。
    参加“国际妇女对朝鲜美李军暴行调查团”的中国团员刘清扬、白朗、李铿三人，也于同日致电斯图加特保障人权自由同盟主席奥托·瓦尔，声援瓦赫特夫人。信中表示：她们愿列名为该同盟所组织的“保卫瓦赫特委员会”委员，全力为营救瓦赫特夫人而奋斗。她们同时写信给现在狱中的瓦赫特夫人说：“你为了和平，为了我们未来一代的幸福，进行了奋不顾身的斗争，我们谨表示无限的敬意，并向你致以亲切的慰问。全世界的正义人士都在支援你，营救你，谨祝你早日恢复自由，并继续为我们共同的、神圣的、保卫和平的事业而奋斗。”
