    To Marshal Stalin:
    On the occasion of the thirty-fourth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, we extend our warm congratulations and high respect to you and the people of the Soviet Union.
    In the cause of building our own motherland, the Chinese people deeply recognize that the victory of the Chinese people is inseparable from the victory of the Soviet socialist revolution. The Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow. We, the Chinese people, are united closely under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, and are marching towards this glorious and splendid future.
    We Chinese people have boundless confidence in the victory of the anti-aggression struggle, the victory of building our great country, and the victory of defending world lasting peace. In celebrating this great festival that has determined the victory of the world's people, we are even more filled with encouragement and gratitude.
    We wish the Soviet Union's communist construction project ever greater progress, the forces of defending world lasting peace led by the Soviet Union ever greater strength, and the close unity between the Chinese and Soviet peoples ever more consolidated and developed.
    China Association for Promoting Democracy
