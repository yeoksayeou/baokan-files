Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 8th: On November 8th, the personnel of the U.S. delegation issued a public statement, and the U.S. Tokyo headquarters issued a press release, claiming that our proposal on November 7th demanded the immediate and unchangeable determination of the military demarcation line. Because these statements and press releases obviously do not conform to our proposed suggestions and understandings, reporters specifically visited the person in charge of the Korean-Chinese delegation to inquire about the truth. The person in charge of our delegation issued a statement in response: "The statements and press releases issued by the U.S. side are completely inconsistent with the facts. During the discussion on determining the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone in the sub-committee meetings, the U.S. representatives repeatedly requested unilateral so-called adjustments to the existing line of contact, and unreasonably demanded the 'adjustment' of our Kaesong area to be under U.S. occupation. In order to avoid the second agenda item from continuing to be obstructed by the unreasonable demands for so-called adjustments proposed by the other party, we proposed to reach an understanding that neither party should insist on any adjustment to which the other party does not agree. However, at the same time, in order to eliminate all excuses for the U.S. side to continue delaying the armistice negotiations, we also proposed to reach another understanding, namely, if the actual line of contact changes before the signing of the armistice agreement, the initially determined military demarcation line and demilitarized zone should still be revised accordingly at the suggestion of either party based on the actual changes in the line of contact. However, the statements and press releases issued by the U.S. side confused our proposal to use the existing actual line of contact as the military demarcation line without making adjustments with our agreement that if the actual line of contact does change before the signing of the armistice agreement, the initially determined military demarcation line can be revised. Disregarding the facts, they claimed that we demanded the immediate and unchangeable determination of the military demarcation line. This trick of the U.S. side to confuse the public cannot only not conceal the U.S. side's indefensible position in the meeting, but also cannot achieve the purpose of deceiving the people of the world."

    朝中代表团负责人员发表谈话
    斥美方公开歪曲我方建议的诡计
    【新华社开城八日电】十一月八日美方代表团人员所发表的公开谈话与美方东京总部所发表的公报中宣称，我方十一月七日的提议要求不可更改地立即确定军事分界线。由于这些谈话与公报显然与我方所提出的提议与谅解不相符合，记者特走访朝中代表团负责人员询问事实真相。我方代表团负责人员为此发表谈话称：“美方所发表的谈话与公报是与事实完全不符的。美方代表在小组会议确定军事分界线和非军事区的讨论中，一再要求对于现有接触线作片面的所谓调整，无理要求将我方开城地区‘调整’到美方占领之下。为了避免使第二项议程继续为对方所提出的所谓调整的无理要求所阻挠，我方提议达成谅解，一方不得坚持另一方所不同意的任何调整。但同时为了解除美方继续拖延停战谈判的一切藉口，我方也提议达成另一谅解，即如果在停战协议签字前实际接触线有所变化，则已经初步确定的军事分界线和非军事区仍应在任何一方的提议下按照接触线的实际变化作相应的修正。但是美方所发表的谈话和公报中却将我方以现有实际接触线为军事分界线而不作调整的提议，与我方同意的在停战协议签字前如实际接触线确有变化时，已经初步确定的军事分界线可作修正的谅解混作一谈，不顾事实地声称，我方要求不可更改地立即确定军事分界线。美方这种混淆视听的诡计，不但不能掩饰美方在会议中已经无法辩护的立场，并且也不能达到欺骗世界人民的目的。”
