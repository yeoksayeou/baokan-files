　　Talking About Peking University's Work From My Thoughts
    Ma Dayou, Dean of the Faculty of Engineering, Peking University
    In the short span of two years, our motherland, through the in-depth development of the three major movements of land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, has achieved brilliant accomplishments in national defense, politics, economy, and cultural construction. This makes each of us deeply feel excited and proud. Thanks to the wise and correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party! Our motherland has overcome difficulties, defeated enemies, and become an important pillar of peace in Asia and the world. It has become unprecedentedly strong and consolidated. Faced with these great achievements, the thoughts and understanding of the people of the whole country (including teachers in universities) have naturally undergone great changes. Many natural scientists, who previously did not care about politics, are now making urgent demands for political study.

    I myself am an example. I received a bourgeois "liberal education" and have always been engaged in teaching and research in applied science. I had narrow patriotism and vulgar liberalism in my thinking. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, driven by patriotic ideas, I returned to China from the United States, unwilling to make a living abroad. In the Kuomintang-ruled areas, seeing the corruption of politics, I gradually became discouraged and adopted the attitude of "not caring about things I can't control," and stopped asking about politics. At that time, the democratic movement was surging, but because of insufficient political understanding, I had no confidence in it. At that time, besides teaching, I did some research work that was divorced from reality, and sent one or two papers to foreign magazines every year, thinking that I had done my duty to the motherland. After working in the Faculty of Engineering for a few years, I saw that most teachers only passed on the knowledge learned from foreign countries or from foreign books to students without any changes, acting as "knowledge peddlers." They contributed little to the progress of science and technology, and the students trained could only substitute formulas and use slide rules. I felt that this was very wrong and believed that this was the reason for the underdevelopment of science and industry in our country. Therefore, I proposed the establishment of a five-year Faculty of Engineering, thinking that if the academic atmosphere of the Faculty of Engineering was improved, the national problems could be solved. Facts have proved that under reactionary rule, this kind of reformist attempt was not encouraged, and several years of work yielded no results—in fact, it could not have yielded any results. In reality, I was unconsciously helping the reactionary rule, using the idea of "saving the country through science" to anesthetize the youth. Before liberation, my thoughts were very confused. I had lost any illusions about the Kuomintang reactionary government, but I had no understanding of the Communist Party either. In the early days of liberation, comrades from some industrial departments often came to solicit opinions on shortening the length of engineering education, and my thinking was also very volatile. I was very dissatisfied with the "excessive" emphasis on workers and the neglect of technicians in many factories in the Northeast. I was especially averse to the discussion of departmental adjustments, thinking that this was a sign of the leadership's dissatisfaction with my work. Two years of work and study have greatly changed my thinking, especially the experience of participating in land reform work has made me more aware of the correctness of all the policies of the People's Government, and I have a further understanding of class stand, the mass line, and so on. To consolidate these gains and correct my mistakes, I must strengthen my studies, so I have great hopes for this study movement. In the study, as a result of preliminary criticism and self-criticism, we have identified some shortcomings and errors.

    Since Mr. Cai Yuanpei advocated the policy of "embracing all ideas" at Peking University, a free and undisciplined school spirit of "you do your thing, I do mine" has been formed, which has remained unchanged for decades. As Professor Jin Kemou said, the school still had no leadership after liberation, and therefore was sometimes even more chaotic. The fact that Director Fan Hong of the School Affairs Committee threw his hat in protest because he could not get a professor position for the Department of Economics is just a typical example. In fact, the School Affairs Committee was equivalent to a departmental consultation meeting (but not every department had a representative). Each member only spoke for his school or his department. When faced with a stalemate, they hoped that the student representatives would say a word, thinking that this was following the mass line. The School Affairs Committee had not listened to the reports of the various schools and departments, and rarely checked or guided the work of the various schools and departments. No member understood the overall situation of the school. Mr. Tang Yongtong, who served as the chairman of the School Affairs Committee for more than two years, had never been to the Faculty of Engineering, and probably rarely went to the Faculty of Science. Administrative leaders were all hard-working functionalists. Department heads were only responsible for arranging course schedules and controlling funding. They had almost no leadership over the work of teachers and the studies of students. The dean's job was to serve as a link between higher and lower levels, forwarding documents, and sometimes even the documents didn't need to be managed. The Academic Affairs Office and the various departments were already in direct contact. Because the work lacked principles, everyone was very busy. Some department heads, in order to take care of a certain teacher in the department and make him feel at ease in his work, would propose to the dean to promote or raise the salary of this teacher. In order not to offend this department head, the dean would raise the issue to the School Affairs Committee regardless of whether it should be promoted or raised, and would argue for him. When the School Affairs Committee met, it did not discuss principles. What it considered was "promoting" this one or "raising" this one, and which others should be proposed, and how to deal with them. The meetings would go on until midnight without any conclusions. That's how our time was spent. Because of the lack of good leadership, the phenomenon of lack of organization and discipline in the school was very serious. Some time ago, there was even a collective fraud by staff members. Many teachers freely held concurrent jobs or courses outside the school. Some students even took eight or nine hours of extra classes outside the school, which seriously affected the progress of teaching and caused losses to the work of training construction cadres for the motherland.

    Because of the lack of correct ideological leadership, unprincipled disputes and disunity between departments and schools were also very serious in the past. The dispute over funding between the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Science and Engineering took a long time to resolve, and the result was that neither side was satisfied. Individual departments also wasted funds, causing dissatisfaction among other departments. The school's system had not been established for a long time. The number of teachers in each department had not been determined until now, and many disputes came from this. The disunity among teachers was even more common. A teacher in the Department of Mechanical Engineering had opinions about the department head, but did not raise them for more than a year. In this study, because others frankly raised their opinions, he raised his own. Similar things happened in other departments as well. Two professors in a certain department had different views on the department's affairs, and engaged in unprincipled mutual attacks. Each of them denigrated the other so much that the department's work suffered great losses. In contrast, some departments engaged in unprincipled "unity," forming small cliques, and even becoming independent groups within the school. The head of a certain department went to Shanghai for two or three months for personal matters during class time, without explaining the course or the department's affairs. The teachers and students in the department only complained. When the school sought their opinions on how to deal with this matter, they could not offer any (mostly because of personal relationships, and others were afraid of offending people).

    Many teachers' thinking is conservative and complacent. A few people feel that they are progressive enough. However, many teachers in the Faculty of Engineering feel that what we are doing is natural science, which has nothing to do with politics. As long as Party members and Youth League members can "live in peace" with us and let us work quietly, we will be satisfied. There is no motivation to seek progress. In fact, none of our work and life can be separated from politics, let alone that. How can the teaching of natural science not be affected by politics at all? The purpose of our teaching is to cultivate outstanding cadres who are both virtuous and talented, physically strong, and have a high level of communist consciousness. To achieve this goal, various courses (including professional courses) must have rich political content and patriotic content. However, some teachers do exactly the opposite, and sometimes even promote capitalist culture. The person in charge of managing experiments tells students that American goods are reliable. When lecturing on electronics or radio, they only talk about Marconi's experiments and Edison's effect, but they do not mention a word about the contribution of the great Soviet scientist Popov, who first conducted radio communication experiments. As for our own country, there is even less to say, the reason being: this is all because it is not in American textbooks. Some teachers lecture on how American and British machines are designed, how German machines are designed..., but there is no discussion of how our own machines are. Although this kind of thinking of "worshiping England and America, being superstitious about Germany, exaggerating Japan, doubting the Soviet Union, and not believing in ourselves" is not universal, it is still quite common. Isn't this influenced by imperialist propaganda? We have been too influenced by imperialist propaganda in the past, and the pro-American ideology has not been completely eliminated. The disconnection between our teaching work and the actual situation of our motherland is the evil result of this residual poison.

    There are many cases of emphasizing personal interests in work. Some professors even emphasize their personal interests in research, demanding "freedom" from teaching, and not considering the important task of training cadres at all. Sometimes lectures are also based on personal interests, without considering actual needs. They often consider personal interests when things happen, and sometimes they do not hesitate to destroy the school's system for personal interests. The lecturers and teaching assistants in the school are all young people. The People's Government has high expectations for them, hoping to train them into excellent teachers in a short period of time and become the emerging backbone of universities. However, a few professors disregard the school's regulations, privately take on extra classes outside the school, hindering their work; especially importantly, hindering the improvement of their professional skills and affecting the reform of higher education. Perhaps everyone has some reasons, but basically it is still about current personal interests. The result of the development of this individualism and vulgar liberalism is that most teachers are indifferent to the school, only doing their own work. The affairs of the department are only managed by the department head. No one asks what he is doing. Even few people know what the School Affairs Committee has done. The freedom and undiscipline of the school are natural. Individual heroism is also quite common among teachers. The motivation for the work of some teachers is entirely based on individual heroism: writing a research paper, the purpose is to have their name printed on it; hoping to make a splash with every word they say; even if it is the truth, they are unwilling to parrot others. Sometimes when they encounter setbacks in their work, they lose their motivation.

    In terms of work style, there is more or less bureaucracy and feudal patriarchalism in all parts of the school. Speaking for myself, I can only be considered a young and promising person in the school, but more than half of the teachers in the department are my students. In the departments with a long history, it is common to have three generations or five generations of teachers. Therefore, almost all the affairs of the department are decided by the director, with everyone agreeing. There is not much discussion, let alone criticism. In the School Affairs Committee, the senior members speak and the junior members listen.

    The above is certainly not comprehensive, and there are many other shortcomings. There has been some progress in the past two years, especially after President Ma Yinchu came to the school, many shortcomings have been corrected, making Peking University gradually move in the direction of organization, system, and leadership. However, there are still many problems. Therefore, there is a widespread demand in the school for planned and systematic political study and ideological transformation. After listening to Premier Zhou's report and going through six weeks of discussion and study, self-criticism has been widely launched and some gains have been made. When we read Chairman Mao's opening remarks at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, "Ideological remolding, especially the ideological remolding of intellectuals, is one of the important conditions for our country to thoroughly realize democratic reform in all aspects and gradually implement industrialization," we deeply felt Chairman Mao's concern for us. We have realized that the ideological remolding of university teachers is a part of the construction of the motherland. We have a responsibility to the motherland and to ourselves to step up our efforts to do a good job in this study movement. We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, use our greatest strength, use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to carry out self-education and self-transformation, solve practical problems, and strive to transform ourselves into people's teachers who are urgently needed by the motherland.

　　从我的思想谈到北京大学的工作
    北京大学工学院院长  马大猷
    祖国在短短的两年中，通过土地改革、镇压反革命、抗美援朝三大运动的深入展开，在国防、政治、经济、文化各项建设上都获得了辉煌的成就，使我们每一个人都深切地感到兴奋和骄傲。感谢毛主席和中国共产党的英明正确领导！我们祖国已战胜困难、战胜敌人，成为亚洲和平以及全世界和平的重要支柱。她已空前地壮大和巩固了。在这些伟大成就的前面，全国人民（包括高等学校教师）的思想和认识都自然地有了很大的转变，很多自然科学工作者，以前不关心政治的，现在也对政治学习提出了迫切的要求。
    我个人就是一个例子。我受的是资产阶级的“自由教育”，一直从事应用科学的教学和研究工作，在思想中存在着狭隘的爱国主义和庸俗的自由主义。在抗战期中，受爱国思想的驱使，从美国回到国内来，不肯在外国混饭吃。在国民党统治区域，见到政治腐败的情形，渐渐灰心，就采取了“管不了的事，不管”的态度，不问政治了。那时正是民主运动高涨的时候，但是因为政治认识不够，对它也没有信心。那时，除了教书外，就是作些脱离实际的研究工作，每年写一两篇论文寄给外国杂志发表，觉得也就对得起祖国了。在工学院工作几年，看到多数教师只是把外国学来的或者在外国书籍上学来的知识原封不动地传授给学生，做做“知识贩子”，对科学技术的进步很少贡献，训练出来的学生也只能代代公式，拉拉算尺，觉得很不对，并且认为这就是祖国科学和工业不发达的原因。因此提出了创办五年制工学院的主张，以为提高了工学院的学术空气，国家问题就可以解决了。事实证明，在反动统治下，这种改良主义的尝试也得不到鼓励，几年的工作没有任何成绩——事实上也不可能有任何成绩。自己实际是不自觉地做了反动统治的帮凶，用“科学救国”的思想麻醉了青年。解放前，自己思想非常混乱，对国民党反动政府已失去了任何幻想，但对共产党也没有认识。解放初期，常常有些工业部门的同志来征求对缩短工程教育年限的意见，思想也很受波动。对于东北许多工厂“过分地”重视工人，忽略技术人员是非常不满意的。对院系调整的讨论尤其有反感，以为这是领导上对自己工作不满意的表示。两年的工作和学习使我的思想有很大转变，尤其是在参加土地改革工作中的经验使我更加认识了人民政府一切政策的正确性，对阶级立场，群众路线等也有进一步的体会。要想巩固这些收获并且纠正自己的错误，非加强学习不可，因此对这次的学习运动是有极大希望的。在学习中，初步进行批评自我批评的结果，我们已经检查出一些缺点和错误。
    北京大学自蔡孑民先生提倡“兼容并蓄”政策以来，就形成了“你搞你的，我搞我的”的自由散漫校风，几十年来如一日。如金克木教授所说，解放后学校还是没有领导的，因而有时更是紊乱了。校务委员会中樊弘主任为经济系争不到一个教授名额而掼纱帽只是一个典型的例子而已。事实上，校务委员会等于院系协商会议（但并不是各系都有代表），每位委员只是代表他的院或者他的系说话，遇到相持不下的时候，则希望同学代表讲一句话，以为这就是走群众路线。校务委员会没有听过各院系的报告，对各院系的工作也很少检查或指导。没有一个委员是了解全校情况的，汤用彤先生作了二年多的校务委员会主席，从来也没有到过工学院，恐怕理学院也很少去。行政负责人都是辛辛苦苦的事务主义者，系主任只是管排功课表，掌握经费，对教员的工作，同学的学习差不多都没有领导。院长管的是承上启下，转转公文，甚至于有时公文都用不着管，教务处和各系都已直接联系好了。因为工作缺乏原则，搞得大家都非常忙。有的系主任为了照顾系中某先生，使他工作安心，就向院长提出给这先生升级或加薪。院长为了不得罪这位系主任，不管是不是该升该加就提到校务委员会，并且替他力争。校务委员会开会时也不谈原则，所考虑的是“升”了这一个或“加”了这一个，还有那些人也要提出，怎么样对付，一开开到半夜，没有结论。我们的时间就是这样用去的。因为没有很好的领导，学校中无组织无纪律的现象很严重，前些时还有职员集体舞弊的事，教员自由在外兼任工作或课程的很多，同学甚至于有不少在外面兼课到八九小时的，严重地影响了教学工作的进行，使为祖国培养建设干部的工作受到了损失。
    因为缺乏正确的思想领导，系与系间，院与院间无原则的争执和不团结在过去也很严重。法学院与理工学院的经费争执很久才得到解决，结果还是都不满意。个别的系还有浪费经费的情形，引起他系的不满。全校的制度很久没有建立起来，各系教师名额到现在还没有确定，很多争执都是从这里来的。教师间的不团结更是普遍，机械系的一位教师对系主任有意见，一年多也没有提，这次学习中因为别人都直率地提了意见，他才提出，像这样的事别的系也都有。某系两位教授因为对系务的见解不同，无原则的互相攻击，每个人都把对方糟踏得不成样子，使系中工作受了很大的损失。和这个相反的是，有的系作无原则的“团结”，形成小宗派，甚至于在学校内成了独立集团。某系的主任在上课期间为了私事跑到上海去两三个月，课程系务都没有交代。系中的教师和同学也只发发牢骚。学校征求他们对处理这事的意见时，竟提不出来（多数是因为私人感情的关系，其他则怕得罪人）。
    很多教师的思想是保守自满的。少数人觉得自己是够进步的了。但是在工学院很多教师觉得我们搞的是自然科学，与政治无关，只要党团员们能和我们“相安无事”，让我们安安静静工作就于愿已足了，没有要求进步的动力。事实上，我们任何人的工作和生活都无法脱离政治，这且不提。就是自然科学的讲授又何尝能丝毫不受政治的影响呢？我们教学的目的是为培养德才兼备、体魄健全、具有高度共产主义觉悟水平的优秀干部。为达到这个目的，各种课程（包括业务课程）中就必须具有丰富的政治内容，爱国主义内容。但是有的教师作的恰好相反，有时简直是宣扬资本主义文化。管理实验的先生告诉同学说美国货可靠。讲电子学或无线电时，一讲就是马可尼试验，爱迪生效应，对于最早作无线电通信试验的伟大苏联科学家波波夫的贡献却一字不提，本国的就更没有可说的了，理由是：这都是因为美国教科书上没有的。有的教师讲授美国英国的机器怎样设计，德国的怎样设计……，至于我国的机器怎么样呢，却没有讨论。像这种“崇拜英美，迷信德国，夸张日本，怀疑苏联，不相信自己”的思想虽然不是人人都有，但仍是相当普遍的。难道这不是受帝国主义宣传的影响么？我们过去受帝国主义宣传的影响太大，崇美思想还没有完全肃清。我们的教学工作与祖国的实际脱节，就是这种余毒的恶果。
    在工作上强调个人兴趣的情形很多。甚至于有的教授强调个人对研究的兴趣，要求不教书的“自由”，对培养干部的重要任务毫不考虑。讲书有时也从个人兴趣出发，不考虑实际需要。遇事常考虑到个人的利益，有时为个人利益不惜破坏学校制度。学校中的讲师、助教都是一些青年，人民政府对他们期望很高，希望在短期内把他们培养成优良的师资，并成为高等学校中的新兴骨干。但少数教授却不顾学校的规定，私自在外兼课，妨碍了工作；尤其重要的，妨碍了业务的改进，影响了高等教育的改革。也许每个人都有一些理由，但是基本上还是目前的个人利益。这种个人主义和庸俗的自由主义发展的结果，使多数教师对学校漠不关心，只搞自己的工作，系中的事情只有系主任管，他作的什么，大家也不问，甚至校务委员会作了些什么事，也没有几个人知道。学校的自由散漫是自然的。个人英雄主义在教师间也是相当普遍的，部分教师的工作动力是完全靠个人英雄主义的：作一篇研究论文，目的是要在上面印上自己的名字；讲一句话也希望一鸣惊人；即使是真理也不愿人云亦云。工作有时遇到挫折，就没有动力了。
    在工作作风上，学校中各部分都或多或少地存在着官僚主义和封建家长主义。以我个人而论，我在学校中只能算是少壮派，可是系中教师半数以上都是我的学生。在历史长的系里，三代同堂、五代同堂是常有的事。因此系里的事几乎完全是主任说话，大家同意，没有多少讨论，更没有批评。在校务委员会里也是大委员讲话，小委员听。
    上面所述当然不够全面，其他缺点还不少。在两年中已有了一些进步，尤其是马寅初校长到校后，许多缺点已经加以纠正，使北京大学逐渐走向有组织，有制度，有领导的方向。但是问题还是很多的，因此学校中普遍地要求有计划有系统地学习政治、改造思想。听了周总理的报告后，又经过了六个星期的讨论学习，已普遍地展开了自我批评，得到了一些收获。当我们读到毛主席在人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议的开会词中的“思想改造，首先是知识分子的思想改造，是我国在各方面彻底实现民主改革和逐步实行工业化的重要条件之一。”后，我们深深地感觉到毛主席对我们的关切。我们已认识到高等学校教师的思想改造是祖国建设的一部分。我们对祖国对自己都有责任加紧努力把这次学习运动搞好。我们要遵循毛主席的指示，用最大力量，以批评和自我批评的武器进行自我教育和自我改造，解决实际问题，努力把自己改造为祖国所迫切需要的人民教师。
