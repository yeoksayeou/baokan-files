    Northeast Implements Regional Grain Transportation
    Overcoming Waste from Blind Transfers

    Since November, the People's Economic Planning Committee of the Northeast People's Government has implemented rational regional grain transportation to correct the serious waste of transportation capacity caused by blind transportation in the past.

    The creation of this unreasonable phenomenon is mainly due to insufficient planning within the units themselves. For example, the Grain Company transports corn from Xinmin, Jinzhou, Xingcheng, and Suizhong in Liaoxi Province to Dalian via Shenyang; it also transfers corn from areas north of Shenyang into the customs area via Xinmin, Jinzhou, and other places. Another example is that the railway system transports corn from Changchun to Dehui on the one hand, and transports corn from Dehui to Changchun on the other hand. This wastes train cars and increases the burden of loading and unloading.

    Due to the lack of planning in transportation, the unreasonable phenomena in actual transportation are even more serious. In March of this year alone, the Grain Company, the Grain Bureau, and the Cooperatives unreasonably used 2,132 train cars in actual transportation, resulting in a relative transportation of 317,742 car-kilometers, and an overpayment of transportation costs of 976.6 million RMB.

    The main reasons for the unreasonable transportation are: 1. There are many units involved in grain management, transportation is dispersed, and there is a lack of unified and planned leadership; 2. The main grain transportation units do not have a good grasp of the supply and demand situation, and the specific business plans for procurement, storage, processing, supply, and transportation are not integrated or insufficiently integrated. Therefore, even within the same unit during the same transportation period, there are unreasonable transportation phenomena; 3. There is a lack of an economic accounting perspective on transportation. (Compiled by this newspaper)

    东北实行粮食分区运输
    克服盲目调运的浪费现象
    东北人民政府人民经济计划委员会自十一月份起，实行粮食分区合理运输，以纠正过去由于盲目运输而造成的严重浪费运输力的现象。
    这种不合理现象的造成，主要是由于本单位的计划性不够。如粮食公司将辽西省新民、锦州、兴城、绥中等地的苞米经过沈阳运至大连；又将沈阳以北各地的苞米经过新民、锦州等地调运进关。又如铁路系统一方面将长春苞米运至德惠，一方面又将德惠苞米运至长春。浪费了车皮，也增加装卸车的负担。
    由于运输计划性不够，实际运输中的不合理现象就更为严重。仅粮食公司、粮食局与合作社三个单位，在今年三月份实际运输中不合理使用的车数即达二千一百三十二车，共相对运输三一七、七四二车公里，多支付了运输费用达人民币九亿七千六百万元。
    产生不合理运输的主要原因是：一、粮食经营的单位系统多，运输分散，缺乏统一而有计划的领导；二、各主要运粮单位，对于供需情况掌握不够，采购、储备、加工、供应、运输等具体业务计划互不结合或结合不够，因此同一单位在同一运输期间内，也存在着不合理的运输现象；三、缺乏运输上的经济核算观点。（本报综合）
