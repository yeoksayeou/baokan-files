　　Eighty-Year-Old Li Lanhai Suggests Improving Autumn Cultivation Methods, Storing Rain and Snow to Ensure Timely Planting
    I am an eighty-one-year-old man. Seeing the country strong and the people living in peace, I feel young and energetic. Now I'm going to tell everyone about a way to improve autumn cultivation and store rain and snow.
    The rainfall in North China is sparse, especially in the spring. My hometown in central Hebei is mostly dry land, and often cannot be sown in the spring due to dry soil.
    I believe that, in addition to using artificial irrigation to resist drought and sow seeds, in areas without irrigation conditions, it is best to improve the cultivation method and store winter snow and spring rain in advance for spring sowing. Northern farmers, according to old rules, level the land after plowing. In this way, winter snow is easily blown away by the wind or dried by the sun, and it is even more difficult to store spring rain, resulting in particularly dry soil during spring sowing. My experience is: during autumn cultivation, the land should be plowed into "furrow ridges" one after another. In this way, rain and snow will naturally flow into the ditches. In addition, use woven branches to place diagonally on the ditches to guide rain and snow from outside the ditches into the ditches, which will keep the soil in the ditches moist. When sowing in the spring, sow the seeds in the ditches, and the seedlings will inevitably be lush. If there is more spring rain, they will easily grow up. This method is better than carrying water to plant seeds in the spring.

    Editor's Note: It is beneficial to adopt this method in areas with abundant rain and snow in winter, but in areas with little rain and snow in winter, plowing into ridges and furrows like this may easily lose water. Various regions can try it out according to specific circumstances.

　　八十老翁李兰陔建议改良秋耕方法，储存雨雪保证及时下种
    我是一个八十一岁的老人，眼看现在国家强盛、人民安乐，觉得自己也年青有力了。我现在告诉大家一个改良秋耕和储存雨雪的办法。
    华北地区雨量稀少，春天更少。我的家乡河北中部多是旱田，每当春季往往因土干不能下种。
    我以为，除了用人工灌溉抗旱播种外，在没有灌溉条件的地方，最好是改良耕地方式，预先把冬雪春雨储积起来，以备春播。北方农民依照老规矩，在土地犁过以后，一律把地耙平。这样，冬雪便容易被风吹散，或被太阳晒干，更不易储存春雨，致使春播时土壤特别干燥。我的经验是：在秋耕时候，应即把地耕成一垅挨一垅的“墒沟”，这样雨雪就自然流到沟内，另外用荆条编织起来，斜放沟上引导沟外雨雪进入沟内，这就使沟内土壤能常保湿润。春种时，就将种子播在沟内，出苗必然茂盛。再受春雨，就容易长成。这种办法胜于春天担水点种。

    编者按：在冬季雨雪多的地方采用这种办法是有好处的，但在冬季雨雪不多的地区，这样犁成沟垅，反而容易损失水量。各地可以根据具体情况试行。
