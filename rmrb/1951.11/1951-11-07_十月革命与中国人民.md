    The October Revolution and the Chinese People
    Xu Deheng
    Progressive people of the world, revolutionary people, and all fighters who uphold peace, democracy, and socialism, are enthusiastically celebrating the 34th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution on this day, November 7th.
    The victorious Chinese people, with boundless excitement and gratitude, are even more enthusiastically cheering this great festival that has opened a new era in human history.
    As Marshal Stalin pointed out: "The October Revolution is not merely a revolution within national boundaries. It is first and foremost an international, worldwide revolution, because it is a fundamental shift in the history of all mankind from the old world of capitalism to the new world of socialism." (Stalin: "The International Character of the October Revolution")
    The impact of the October Revolution on the Chinese people has been extensive and profound. Due to the call and encouragement of the victory of the October Socialist Revolution, the Chinese people, through countless failures and lessons, found the correct path of struggle. The Chinese working class and the Chinese people learned the invincible revolutionary theory—Marxism-Leninism—and established a revolutionary proletarian party in the style of Lenin and Stalin—the Chinese Communist Party. Without the revolutionary theory of Marxism-Leninism as armament, and without the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao Zedong, a faithful student of Marx and Lenin, it is unimaginable that the Chinese people could have achieved such a huge historic victory.
    The Chinese people deeply recognize that only the socialist Soviet Union is our truly loyal friend. If we want to resist oppression, oppose imperialism, and gain true independence, freedom, democracy, and happiness, we can only form a permanent friendship with the Soviet Union, which wholeheartedly helps us. Chairman Mao told us: "In the era of imperialism, no genuine people's revolution in any country can achieve its own victory without assistance in various forms from international revolutionary forces. Even if victory is achieved, it cannot be consolidated." (Mao Zedong: "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship")
    Facts have proven that Chairman Mao's instruction is absolutely correct. The victory of the Soviet October Socialist Revolution linked the revolutionary struggles of the Western proletariat and the oppressed nations of the East, forming a revolutionary front against international imperialism, making the Chinese revolution a part of the world proletarian revolution, and creating favorable conditions with decisive effect for the Chinese revolution, thereby shortening the revolutionary process. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union was first to establish diplomatic relations with us, and on February 14, 1950, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance was signed, further strengthening and consolidating the long-standing friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union. The great unity of the 700 million people of China and the Soviet Union, accounting for more than one-third of the world's population, is an invincible force for defeating the imperialist policy of aggression and war and defending world peace. The Soviet Union's enormous and selfless assistance over the past two years has greatly helped the Chinese people, enabling us to achieve brilliant successes in various construction undertakings in our motherland.
    However, the decadent and moribund imperialists cannot see the strength of the great unity between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, nor can they see the strength of the great unity of the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union. They are still妄想ing to bully the Chinese people and dominate the world. As Chairman Mao pointed out in his opening address to the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "Their ideas are arrogant, futile, and impossible to achieve." Chairman Mao also told us: "Since the victory of the great Soviet October Socialist Revolution, the situation of the world's people's victory has been determined, and now this situation has been developed and consolidated due to the founding of the People's Republic of China and the establishment of various people's democratic countries." Therefore, as the imperialist's corrupt rule teeters and the world people's liberation struggle vigorously develops today, we celebrate the brilliant anniversary of the 34th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution of our closest ally, the Soviet Union, and we must:
    First, learn from the experience of the Soviet people in defeating foreign armed interventionists after the October Revolution, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet people in smashing the frenzied attacks of the Hitler German bandits during the anti-fascist war, learn from the Soviet people's spirit of patriotism and internationalism, and continue to strengthen the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country. We know that after the Chinese people drove away imperialism and defeated the reactionary regime of Chiang Kai-shek, a running dog of US imperialism, US imperialism was not reconciled to its failure, and it more blatantly hated the Chinese people's cause of liberation. It occupies our territory of Taiwan and supports the remnant bandit gang of Chiang Kai-shek; it signed an illegal separate peace treaty with Japan, colluding with Japanese militarist elements to create a new war of aggression; it invaded our neighbor Korea, violated our country's airspace, and threatened the security of our motherland; it sent spies, secret agents, and assassins to sneak into our mainland to carry out various sabotage activities. Therefore, in order to ensure the security of our motherland and the cause of world peace and democracy, all our people must follow Chairman Mao's instructions and regard the work of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea as our central task. Our members of the Jiusan Society and national cultural, educational, and scientific workers must carry out patriotic production increase and strict economy movement under the general task of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, promote national defense and economic construction, and mobilize all our manpower, material resources, and financial resources to support the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, and thoroughly defeat the US imperialist aggressors.
    Second, study Marxism-Leninism, study Mao Zedong Thought, and master the ideological weapon of revolution. We know that the reason why the great Soviet October Socialist Revolution achieved brilliant victory is mainly because the Soviet people found the universal truth applicable everywhere—Marxism-Leninism. Marx once said: "Theory, once it grips the masses, becomes a material force." It was precisely by virtue of this great material force that the Soviet people overthrew the Tsarist system, smashed the conspiracies of all reactionaries at home and abroad, and built a strong proletarian state, becoming a strong fortress for safeguarding the cause of world peace and democracy. It was precisely by virtue of this great material force, and by virtue of the revolutionary weapons of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, that the Chinese people's cause of liberation achieved a huge historic victory. Therefore, in order to develop and consolidate this victory, we must earnestly study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, correctly master the ideological weapon of revolution, strive to overcome all old ideological consciousness, overcome all incorrect ways of thinking and working methods, establish the proletarian stand, viewpoint, and method, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, do a good job in the united front work, do a good job in cultural education and scientific and technological work, and serve the people wholeheartedly, and serve our great motherland.
    Third, we know that Sino-Soviet friendship is an invincible force for defending world peace. The reason why imperialism tries its best to undermine the friendship between China and the Soviet Union is because they are afraid of peace and妄想 to launch wars of aggression to seize profits for a few monopoly capitalists. Therefore, in order to defeat the sinister conspiracy of imperialism to expand wars of aggression, in order to ensure the victorious fruits of the Chinese people's revolution, and for the sacred cause of peace, democracy, and socialism of the people of the world, we must further strengthen and consolidate the fraternal friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, further strengthen and consolidate the friendship between the people's democratic countries and the working people of capitalist countries, expand the united front of the world's people against imperialist struggle, and continue to advance toward winning the final victory in the struggle against imperialist aggression.
    Let us shout:
    Long live the victory of the great Soviet October Socialist Revolution!
    Long live the immortal friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union!
    Long live the victory of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought!
    Long live the great teacher and leader, Marshal Stalin!

    十月革命与中国人民
    许德珩
    全世界进步的人类，革命的人民，一切拥护和平、民主与社会主义的斗士，在十一月七日这一天，都热烈地庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十四周年。
    胜利了的中国人民，更以无限兴奋和感激的心情，热烈欢呼这个开辟了人类历史新纪元的伟大的节日。
    正如斯大林大元帅所指出：“十月革命并不是单单民族范围内的革命。它首先是国际性、世界性的革命，因为它是全世界人类历史中由资本主义旧世界进到社会主义新世界的根本转变。”（斯大林：“十月革命底国际性质”）
    十月革命给中国人民的影响是广泛而深刻的。由于十月社会主义革命胜利的号召和鼓舞，中国人民在无数次的失败教训中，才找到了正确的斗争的道路，中国工人阶级和中国人民才学到了所向无敌的革命理论——马克思列宁主义，建立了列宁斯大林式的革命的无产阶级政党——中国共产党。没有马克思列宁主义的革命理论做武装，没有以马克思、列宁的忠实学生毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党的领导，中国人民要获得如此巨大历史性的胜利，是不可想像的。
    中国人民深切地认识到，只有社会主义的苏联才是我们真正忠实的朋友。我们要反抗压迫，要反对帝国主义，要获得真正忠实的朋友。我们要反抗压迫，要反对帝国主义，要获得真正的独立、自由、民主、幸福，也只有和忠心援助我们的苏联结成永久的朋友。毛主席告诉我们：“在帝国主义存在的时代，任何国家的真正的人民革命，如果没有国际革命力量在各种不同方式上的援助，要取得自己的胜利是不可能的。胜利了，要巩固，也是不可能的。”（毛泽东：“论人民民主专政”）
    事实证明了毛主席这个指示是千真万确的。由于苏联十月社会主义革命的胜利，把西方无产阶级和东方被压迫民族的革命斗争联结起来，组成一个反对国际帝国主义的革命战线，使中国革命成为世界无产阶级革命一部分，并替中国革命创造了有决定作用的有利的条件，因而缩短了革命的行程。中华人民共和国成立后，苏联首先和我们建立外交关系，并于一九五○年二月十四日订立了中苏友好同盟互助条约，从而使中苏两国人民久已存在的友谊进一步加强和巩固。占世界人口三分之一以上的中苏两国七亿人民的伟大团结，是战胜帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策保卫世界和平的无敌力量。两年来苏联的巨大的无私的援助，大大地帮助了我们中国人民，使我们能够在祖国的各种建设事业中，获得辉煌的成就。
    但是，腐朽的、垂死的帝国主义者看不到中苏两国人民的伟大团结的力量，看不到以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营的伟大团结的力量，他们还在妄想欺负中国人民，称霸世界。正如毛主席在人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议的开会词所指出：“他们的想法是狂妄的，是徒然的，是不可能达到目的的。”毛主席又告诉我们：“自从伟大的苏联十月社会主义革命胜利以后，世界上人民胜利的局面就确定了，现在则因为中华人民共和国的成立和各人民民主国家的成立而使这个局面发展和巩固了。”因此，当帝国主义的腐烂统治摇摇欲坠，世界人民解放斗争蓬勃发展的今天，我们庆祝我们最亲密的盟国苏联的十月社会主义革命三十四周年光辉的纪念日，必须：
    第一、学习十月革命后苏联人民打败了外国武装干涉者的经验，学习苏联人民在反法西斯战争时期击溃希特勒德国匪军的疯狂进攻的先进经验，学习苏联人民爱国主义和国际主义的精神，继续加强抗美援朝保家卫国运动。我们知道，当中国人民赶走了帝国主义，打垮了美帝国主义的走狗蒋介石的反动政权以后，美帝国主义对它的失败并不甘心，它更加露骨地仇视中国人民的解放事业。它霸占我国领土台湾，扶持蒋介石残余匪帮；它签订非法的单独对日和约，勾结日本军国主义分子，制造新的侵略战争；它侵略我们的邻邦朝鲜，侵犯我国的领空，威胁我们祖国的安全；它派遣间谍、特务、暗害分子，潜入我国大陆进行各种破坏活动。因此，为了保障我们祖国的安全和世界和平民主事业，我们全国人民必须遵照毛主席的指示，把抗美援朝工作当做我们的中心任务。我们九三学社的社员和全国文教科学工作者，必须在抗美援朝的总任务下，开展爱国增产和厉行节约运动，推进国家的国防和经济建设，动员我们一切的人力、物力、财力来支持英勇的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，彻底打败美帝国主义侵略者。
    第二、学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东思想，掌握革命的思想武器。我们知道，苏联伟大的十月社会主义革命之所以取得辉煌的胜利，主要是因为苏联人民找到了放之四海而皆准的普遍真理——马克思列宁主义。马克思曾说道：“理论掌握了群众便成为物质的力量。”苏联人民正是借着这种伟大的物质力量，把沙皇制度打倒了，把国内外一切反动派的阴谋摧毁了，从而建设了强大的无产阶级的国家，成为维护世界和平民主事业的坚强的堡垒。我们中国人民也正是借着这种伟大的物质力量，借着马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的革命的武器，使我们的解放事业获得了巨大的历史性的胜利。因此，为了发展和巩固这种胜利，我们必须认真钻研马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，正确地掌握革命的思想武器，努力克服一切旧的思想意识，克服一切不正确的思想方法和工作方法，建立无产阶级的立场、观点、方法，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导之下，做好统一战线的工作，做好文化教育和科学技术的工作，全心全意为人民服务，为我们伟大的祖国服务。
    第三、我们知道，中苏友好是保卫世界和平的无敌力量。帝国主义之所以千方百计破坏中苏两国的友谊，就是因为他们害怕和平，而妄想发动侵略战争，为少数独占资本家攫取利润。因此，为了击败帝国主义扩大侵略战争的罪恶阴谋，为了保障中国人民革命的胜利果实，为了全世界人民的和平、民主和社会主义的神圣事业，我们必须进一步加强和巩固中苏两国人民的兄弟友谊，进一步加强和巩固各人民民主国家和资本主义国家劳动人民的友谊，扩大全世界人民反帝国主义斗争的统一战线，向着争取反帝国主义侵略斗争的最后胜利而继续前进。
    让我们高呼：
    伟大的苏联十月社会主义革命胜利万岁！
    中苏两国人民的不朽的友谊万岁！
    马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想胜利万岁！
    伟大的导师和领袖斯大林大元帅万岁！
