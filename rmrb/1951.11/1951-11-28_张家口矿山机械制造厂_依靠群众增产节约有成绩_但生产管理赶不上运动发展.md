    Zhangjiakou Mining Machinery Factory
    Achieves Success in Increasing Production and Practicing Economy by Relying on the Masses
    But Production Management Cannot Keep Up with the Development of the Movement
    Editor: The Zhangjiakou Mining Machinery Factory overfulfilled its October production task ten days ahead of schedule, and saved a large amount of raw materials and man-hours, equivalent to more than 334,200 catties of millet. The factory's success in achieving the above production results is inseparable from the factory leaders' reliance on the masses and belief in the wisdom and creativity of the masses. However, the factory's current movement to increase production and practice economy still has the following shortcomings: management work has not fully kept up with the development of the movement, such as the production plan of the industrial affairs section is always lagging behind the masses; some management personnel and technical personnel still have conservative ideas and do not believe in the masses. In order to keep the movement going, the leadership should strengthen planning.

    张家口矿山机械制造厂
    依靠群众增产节约有成绩
    但生产管理赶不上运动发展
    编辑同志：张家口矿山机械制造厂提前十天超额完成了十月份生产任务，并节约了大批原材料和工时，约合小米三十三万四千二百余斤。该厂所以获得上述生产成绩，与该厂领导干部依靠群众和相信群众的智慧和创造性是分不开的。但目前该厂增产节约运动还存有以下缺点：管理工作还没有完全跟上运动的发展，如工务科的生产计划老是落后于群众；个别管理人员和技术人员还存有保守思想，不相信群众等现象。为了使运动坚持下去，领导方面还应加强计划性。　焦大海
