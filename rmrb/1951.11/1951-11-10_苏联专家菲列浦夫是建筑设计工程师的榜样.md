Soviet expert Filippov is a good example for architectural design engineers in our country. With his assistance in composition and design, and his personal supervision, buildings that originally would have taken two to three years to complete were finished in one year.

When Filippov arrived in Dihua to assist with China's construction, he first meticulously investigated local wind pressure, snow pressure, temperature, earthquakes, and other factors related to construction. He personally surveyed the construction site's terrain, drilled for geological structures, calculated the specifications, quality, and market prices of local bricks, tiles, and timber. After detailed research, he came to a conclusion: previous giant building foundations in Dihua were wasteful. Upon his suggestion, the new buildings saved a large amount of labor and materials.

Filippov attached great importance to the combination of engineering construction and actual conditions. Some construction engineers in our country believed that brick, stone, and wood structures were outdated and that only reinforced concrete buildings were acceptable. Filippov corrected this unrealistic idea. He said: "Engineering construction must not be divorced from realistic and objective conditions. According to China's current economic situation, especially the geographical environment of Xinjiang, it is entirely appropriate to use bricks, tiles, wood, and stone as much as possible to complete engineering construction. Proposing excessively high engineering standards regardless of reality will hinder the rapid development of China's economic construction."

During construction, Filippov constantly monitored measuring instruments and checked the quality and specifications of the project. When he discovered that some construction workers were mixing broken bricks with a large amount of mortar and pouring it into the middle of the wall when building walls, he immediately stopped them. He pointed out that using broken bricks mixed with mortar to pour would weaken the wall's solidity. Because the bricklayers' efficiency was not high enough, he personally laid bricks, taught the construction workers the Soviet Stakhanov-style bricklaying method, and helped the brick and tile workers improve their tools. He also made all construction workers adopt a specialized division of labor. Under his guidance, the labor efficiency of bricklayers increased from 700 bricks per worker to 2,200 bricks.

Filippov paid great attention to material saving and worker safety. When he saw that the steel bars bent by the workers were often several centimeters longer than needed, he said: "When many steel bars are gathered together, these extra centimeters represent a great waste. As long as the engineering requirements can be met, strict economy must be practiced." For the safety of the workers, Filippov strictly educated and prohibited workers from walking on the roof trusses that had already been placed on the large walls. During the load test of the roof truss, the wooden frame began to deform because the load had exceeded two and a half times the design standard. At this time, he stopped others from approaching the wooden frame and, at the same time, he drilled under the wooden frame to check and study the joints and the degree of bending deformation. This spirit of self-sacrifice and serious responsibility towards work deeply moved every engineer. Thanks to Filippov's cautious and scientific guidance, the Chinese engineers' open-minded research, and the workers' own efforts, no accidents occurred during the entire construction process.

### 苏联专家菲列浦夫是建筑设计工程师的榜样

    苏联专家菲列浦夫是建筑设计工程师的榜样
    苏联专家菲列浦夫是我国建筑设计工程师的好榜样。在他协助构图、设计、亲自监工下，原来需要两三年才能完工的建筑在一年中就完成了。
    菲列浦夫到达迪化协助我国建筑时，首先精密地调查了当地的风压、雪压、气温、地震等和建筑有关的情况，并亲自勘察工地地形，钻探地质构造，计算当地砖瓦木材的规格质量和市价，然后进行了详细的研究，最后做出了结论。他认为迪化市以往巨型建筑基础有浪费。经他建议，新建筑节省了大批人工和材料。
    菲列浦夫十分重视工程建筑要和实际情况相结合。我国某些建筑工程人员曾认为砖石木质建筑已经过时，要建筑就得有钢筋混凝土才行。菲列浦夫纠正了这种不切实际的想法。他说：“建筑工程决不能脱离现实客观条件。按中国的目前经济情况，特别是新疆的地理环境，完全应该尽量用砖瓦木石来完成工程建筑。不顾实际提出过高的工程标准，是会妨害中国经济建设的迅速发展的。”
    施工中，菲列浦夫时刻掌握测量仪器，查看工程的质量规格。他发现有些建筑工人在砌墙时用碎砖掺和大量灰浆灌注在墙中间，就立刻加以制止。他指出，用碎砖掺灰浆来灌注会减弱墙壁的坚固性。因为工人们的砌砖效率不够高，他就亲自动手砌砖，把苏联斯塔哈诺夫式的砌砖方法教给了建筑工人，并且帮助砖瓦工改进了工具，他又使全部建筑工人采用了专责分工的工作方法。在他的指导下，砌砖工人的劳动效率由每工砌砖七百块提高到二千二百块。
    菲列浦夫十分注意材料的节约和工人的安全。他看到工人所弯的钢筋常长出需要的长度有几公分，就说：“集合很多钢筋在一起，这长出来的几公分就是一个很大的浪费。只要能达到工程要求，就必须厉行节约。”为了工人的安全，菲列浦夫严格教育和禁止工人在已经放到大墙上的屋架上行走。在做屋架的负荷试验时，木架因负荷已超过设计标准的两倍半而开始变形。这时，他一方面制止别人接近木架，一方面自己又钻到木架下面检查研究结头及弯曲变形程度。这种自我牺牲和对工作严肃负责的精神深深地感动了每个工程人员。由于菲列浦夫谨慎和科学的指导、我国工程人员的虚心研究和工人本身的努力，整个工程的施工中没有发生事故。
