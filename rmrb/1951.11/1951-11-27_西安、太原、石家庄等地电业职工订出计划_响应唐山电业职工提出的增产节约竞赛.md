(Xinhua News Agency Report) Electricity workers in Xi'an, Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, and other places are enthusiastically responding to the production increase and economy campaign proposed by the Tangshan Electricity Bureau and the Tangshan Power Plant. The Northwest Electricity Management Bureau and the Xi'an Power Plant, after inspecting their work, have formulated a plan to increase production and economize to the value of 700 tons of millet in the fourth quarter of this year, responding to the production increase and economy campaign proposed by all the workers of the Tangshan Electricity Bureau and the Tangshan Power Plant.

Before launching the production increase and economy campaign, the Northwest Electricity Management Bureau and the Xi'an Power Plant mobilized workers in all departments to conduct in-depth inspections of their work. During the major inspection, workers put forward many rationalization proposals, such as the equipment utilization rate in the third quarter being too low (only 33 percent) and too many materials being stockpiled in the material warehouse (some materials exceeding requirements by twenty times). This method of major inspection educated cadres and all workers. For example, Xu Jiamou, the chief engineer of the power plant, after examining his past conservative thinking of not considering exploiting the potential power of the machines, led the technical personnel in discussing the theory that short-term overload power generation would not cause accidents, and conducted on-site experiments. As a result, three old generators increased the installed capacity by 500 kilowatts, thus enabling the plant's equipment utilization rate to increase from 33 percent to 55 percent in the fourth quarter. The workers of the business hall of the Electricity Management Bureau, in order to cooperate with the power plant workers in increasing power generation, ensured the development of more industrial users, increasing sales by 500,000 kilowatt-hours. These measures alone can increase production to the value of 500 tons of millet. In terms of economy, the power plant, based on workers' suggestions, increased the height of the boiler chimney of a certain unit, reducing coal consumption. The plant's technicians also overhauled a certain boiler that had the most accidents, in order to avoid accidents. These rationalization proposals from the workers saved wealth to the value of 200 tons of millet.

The Taiyuan Electricity Bureau and all the workers of its three power plants held a workers' representative meeting on the 21st of this month, and decided to respond to the production increase and economy campaign proposed by all the workers of the Tangshan Electricity Bureau and the Tangshan Power Plant with actions to increase production and economize to the value of 700,000 catties of millet in the fourth quarter. The meeting also wrote a letter to Chairman Mao and all the workers of the Tangshan Electricity Bureau, guaranteeing to achieve the following points:

One, shorten maintenance time, increase power generation, save raw materials, reduce consumption quotas (coal consumption reduced by 8 percent, plant use electricity reduced by 7.2 percent, line loss reduced by 4 percent), exploit the potential capacity of equipment, and save management costs, etc., to ensure that the state increases production and economizes to the value of 700,000 catties of millet. Two, guarantee no personal accidents and power system liability accidents; do a good job in anti-freeze inspection; fully compile the operating procedures of each power plant; 50 percent of the operating personnel will receive short-term training. Three, continue to strengthen patriotic education against U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and regular cultural, technical, and business learning; ensure that all employees participate in more than five hours of political current affairs study per week; and eliminate illiteracy this year. Four, revise the patriotic pact once a month and check it weekly, and complete the donation plan ahead of schedule in November. Five, strengthen business management, complete the work of clearing assets and verifying funds before December 15, so that the capital turnover rate reaches more than 3.6 times; ensure that the load adjustment work is carried out before the end of this year, so that the load rate reaches 70 percent; and the equipment utilization rate is 40 percent higher than the quota. Six, guarantee the implementation of the suggestions of Soviet experts in the fourth quarter plan (including cleaning, fire prevention, protection, coal storage, water level, temperature, etc.); and complete the major overhaul projects of machines and boilers of the affiliated factories this year. Seven, continue to improve the quality of power supply, complete the unified frequency work in the city and the plan to change the distribution voltage; do a good job in the unified scheduling of regional power, and further tap the potential capacity of the equipment.

Currently, each production team of the three power plants affiliated to the Taiyuan Electricity Bureau is drafting specific production increase and economy plans and revising patriotic pacts. The bureau has also established a production increase and economy committee with Party, government, labor union, and Youth League personnel as the core to promote this movement.

The Shijiazhuang Electricity Bureau and all the workers of its three power plants, Weishui, Fengshan, and Shijiazhuang, jointly wrote a letter to the workers of the Tangshan Electricity Bureau on the 22nd, proposing to increase production and economize to the value of 291 tons of millet for the country in November and December. According to the preliminary plan for increasing production and economizing in the fourth quarter of the resolution of the workers' representative meeting held by the Shijiazhuang Electricity Bureau in mid-October, all the workers of the Shijiazhuang Electricity Bureau and its three plants have formulated a plan to increase production and economize in November and December as a competition condition: One, expand electricity sales and rationally adjust the load, compress the "peak load" by 10 percent, and increase the "weekly load" rate by 8 percent. In addition to completing the additional sales tasks assigned by the General Electric Power Bureau, the sales volume to be increased in the two months is equivalent to 126 tons of millet. Two, according to the coal consumption standard from January to October, the coal consumption will be reduced by another 8.13 percent, and the plant use electricity rate will be reduced by another 13.2 percent. The total savings in the two months will be equivalent to 111 tons of millet. Three, Weishui and other three power plants shorten the maintenance time, increase power generation, and save labor and material costs, totaling 54 tons of millet. Four, the equipment utilization rate of the entire bureau will increase by 54 percent by the end of the year. Five, continue to consolidate the safety of power generation and supply, and ensure that from now until the end of the year, the important accidents and personal accidents in the power generation system will be completely eliminated, and the personal accidents in the power supply system will be completely eliminated.

The bureau and plant workers also studied ways to ensure the realization of the production increase and economy plan. For example, boiler workers guarantee to continue to adhere to the working system of the coal saving research committee, improve boiler combustion methods, and save coal. Pumping station workers and windmill workers are prepared to establish a plant electricity consumption research team to control the amount of wind and water used according to the load size and reduce the plant electricity consumption rate. Power supply section workers guarantee to make electricity users use electricity one second earlier and increase sales; switch distribution transformers to improve equipment utilization. Party, government, labor union, and Youth League leading cadres of Weishui, Fengshan and other power plants have specifically divided their labor to lead the competition in depth in the workshops in order to strive to overfulfill the production increase and economy plan.

    西安、太原、石家庄等地电业职工订出计划
    响应唐山电业职工提出的增产节约竞赛
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：西安、太原、石家庄等地电业职工，热烈响应唐山电业局和唐山发电厂职工提出的增产节约竞赛。西北电业管理总局和西安发电厂经过检查工作，订出了在今年第四季度增产节约价值七百吨小米的计划，响应唐山电业局和唐山发电厂全体职工提出的增产节约竞赛。
    西北电业管理总局和西安发电厂在开展增产节约运动前，曾发动各部门的职工深入检查了各部门工作。职工们在大检查中，提出许多合理化建议。如今年第三季度的设备利用率太低（仅到百分之三十三），材料库积压物资太多（有些材料超过需要二十倍）。这种大检查的方法，教育了干部和全体工人。如发电厂总工程师徐嘉谋，在检讨了自己过去不考虑发挥机器潜在力量的保守思想后，就领导技术人员们讨论每天在短时间内超负荷发电不会出事故的理论，并实地进行试验，结果使三部旧发电机增加了五百瓩设备出力，因而全厂电机在第四季度内设备利用率可由过去的百分之三十三提高到百分之五十五。电业管理局营业厅的职工，为配合电厂职工提高发电量，保证多发展工业用户，增加五十万度的销售量。这些办法，就可增产价值五百吨小米的财富。在节约方面，发电厂根据工人建议，把某号机的锅炉烟囱加高，减少了煤耗。该厂的技术人员，也检修了事故最多的某号锅炉，以避免发生事故。职工们这些合理化建议，又节约了价值二百吨小米的财富。
    太原电业局和所属三个发电厂全体职工，在本月二十一日召开了职工代表会议，决定在第四季度以增产节约价值七十万斤小米的财富的行动，响应唐山电业局和唐山发电厂全体职工提出的增产节约竞赛。会议并写信给毛主席及唐山电业局全体职工，保证做到以下数点：
    一、缩短检修时间，增加发电量，节约原材料，降低消耗定额（煤耗降低百分之八，厂用电降低百分之七点二，线路损失降低百分之四），发挥设备潜在能力，节省管理费用等，保证给国家增产节约价值七十万斤小米的财富。二、保证不发生人身事故和发电系统责任事故；做好防冻检查；全部编好各电厂的运行规程；百分之五十的运行人员受到短期轮训。三、继续加强抗美援朝的爱国主义教育和正规的文化、技术、业务学习；保证全体职工参加每周五小时以上的政治时事学习；并在本年内消灭文盲。四、每月修订、每周检查爱国公约一次，并提前在十一月内完成捐献计划。五、加强经营管理，在十二月十五日以前做好清理资产、核定资金的工作，使资金周转率达到三点六次以上；保证本年底前进行负荷调整的工作，使负荷率达到百分之七十；设备利用率较定额提高百分之四十。六、保证实现第四季度计划中的苏联专家的建议（包括清洁、防火、保护、存煤、水位、温度等）；并完成本年度所属各厂机器、锅炉大检修工程。七、继续提高供电的质量，完成本市内统一周波的工作和改变配电电压的计划；做好地区电力统一调度工作，进一步发挥设备的潜在能力。
    目前太原电业局所属三个发电厂各生产小组正在拟订具体增产节约计划和修订爱国公约。该局并以党、政、工、团人员为核心，成立增产节约委员会来推动这一运动。
    石家庄电业局和所属微水、凤山、石家庄三个发电厂全体职工，在二十二日联合写信给唐山电业局职工，提出要在十一、十二两个月中为国家增产节约价值二百九十一吨小米的财富。石家庄电业局和所属三个厂的全体职工，根据该局十月中旬举行的职工代表会议决议的第四季度增产节约初步计划，订出了十一、十二两个月的增产节约计划作为竞赛条件：一、扩大电的销售量，并合理调整负荷，压缩“尖峰负荷”百分之十，提高“周负荷”率百分之八。除完成电业总局追加的售电任务外，两个月中要增产价值一百二十六吨小米的售电量。二、根据一至十月份的煤耗标准，煤耗再降低百分之八点一三，厂用电率再降低百分之十三点二，两个月中共节省价值一百十一吨小米的开支。三、微水等三发电厂缩短检修时间，增加发电量和节省工料费，共价值五十四吨小米。四、全局设备利用率至年底止，提高百分之五十四。五、继续巩固安全发、供电，保证现在到年底止，在发电系统彻底消灭重要事故和人身事故，供电系统彻底消灭人身事故。
    该局、厂职工并研究了保证实现增产节约计划的办法。如锅炉工人保证继续坚持省煤研究委员会的工作制度，改进锅炉燃烧方法，节省用煤。水泵工人和风车工人准备成立厂用电研究小组，做到根据负荷大小掌握风、水用量，降低厂用电率。供电科工人保证做到用电户提前一秒钟用电，增加售电量；倒换配电变压器，提高设备利用率。微水、凤山等发电厂党、政、工、团领导干部为争取超额完成增产节约计划，已具体分工，分别深入车间领导竞赛。
