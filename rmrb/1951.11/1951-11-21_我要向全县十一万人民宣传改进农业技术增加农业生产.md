    Improve agricultural technology, increase agricultural production!
    I want to promote the improvement of agricultural technology and increase agricultural production to the 110,000 people of the entire county.
    This October, I went to Beijing to participate in the Second National Day celebration. On the reviewing stand, I saw the greatness, loveliness, and invincible strength of our motherland. While reviewing the national defense forces of the army, navy, and air force, I recalled the arduous struggles of the Eighth Route Army in the early days of the War of Resistance against Japan, armed with only earthen guns. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, they finally grew into what they are today after fourteen years. I couldn't help but excitedly shout the slogan: "Long live Chairman Mao!" I visited the North China Regional Urban and Rural Materials Exchange Exhibition and major factories and schools in Tianjin. I saw tractors and harvesters, one machine can抵抵抵抵the strength of dozens or hundreds of people. If our farmers in mountainous areas organize and use some new-style farm tools, they can save labor and increase production. These machines are all made by the working class, and I understand the leading significance of the working class. During the meeting in Beijing, the meeting place and dormitory were forty li away, and I took a car back and forth, and I didn't miss any meetings, meals, or sleep. This is the power of the working class. Relying on the peasants to work hard manually, they can't catch up with the progress of society even if they are exhausted to death. This time I went to Beijing, I also heard reports from Premier Zhou and other central leaders. They gave us clear instructions to go back to increase production, improve culture, and do a good job in arming the people. I have firmly remembered everything I heard and saw in Beijing and Tianjin, and I must convey it to the 110,000 people of the entire county. Now the mutual aid group I lead has formulated a winter production plan, mainly: 1. The whole group will engage in sideline transportation seven times, and each mu of land will be fertilized with eighty-five dan (ten dan more than last year); 2. In addition to completing the 4.6 million yuan donation plan, another 2 million yuan will be donated, and the whole group will strive to be a model for long-term implementation of the patriotic pact; 3. Guarantee that 95% of the group members regularly attend winter school and improve the reading group. In order to ensure the thorough implementation of the plan, we have also formulated systems such as criticism and self-criticism, and rewards, and will launch a winter patriotic production competition.

    改进农业技术，提高农业生产！
    我要向全县十一万人民宣传改进农业技术增加农业生产
    今年十月我到北京参加第二届国庆典礼，在观礼台上看到了我们祖国的伟大可爱和强大无敌的力量。在检阅陆空海军国防力量时，我回想起抗战初期的八路军手拿土枪艰苦斗争的情形，在共产党、毛主席的领导下，他们十四年来终于长成现在模样了。我不禁兴奋得喊出了：“毛主席万岁！”的口号。我在天津参观了华北区城乡物资交流展览会和各大工厂、学校等，看到拖拉机、收割机，一个机器可以抵几十、几百人的力量，如果我们山地的农民，组织起来用些新式农具，就能省工又增产。这些机器都是工人阶级制造的，我明白了工人阶级的领导意义。在北京开会时，会址和宿舍相距四十里地，坐上汽车往返，开会、吃饭、睡觉样样不误。这就是工人阶级的力量。要凭农民光用人力蛮干，累死也赶不上社会前进。这次我到北京，还听到周总理等各位中央首长的报告。他们向我们作了明确的指示，要我们回去增加生产，提高文化，搞好人民武装等。在北京、天津听到看到的这一切我都牢牢记住了，我一定要向全县十一万人民作传达。现在我领导的这一互助组已订出冬季生产计划，主要是：一、全组要搞副业运输七次，每亩地要上肥八十五担（比去年增十担）；二、除完成四十六万元捐献计划外，再捐二十万元，全组并要争取做长期执行爱国公约的模范；三、保证组员百分之九十五经常上冬学，和健全读报组。为了保证计划彻底实现，我们又订出了批评与自我批评、奖励等制度，并要展开冬季爱国生产竞赛运动。
