Striving to Further Improve Industrial Production in North China
    Li Fa Kui

　　After vigorous restoration following liberation, industrial production in North China now possesses a production capacity that greatly exceeds that of the Kuomintang era. The production of several major products has surpassed the highest historical production levels. The number of state-owned, private enterprises, and handicraft households has increased dramatically. The proportion of industry in North China's industrial and agricultural production has changed. In 1950, industrial production in North China accounted for 25% of the total value of industrial and agricultural production. Chahar Province, which had relatively little industrial production in North China, saw its proportion of industrial production increase from 13.23% in 1949 to 16.98% in 1950. With the recovery and development of production, workers' lives have improved considerably, and worker unemployment has been eliminated. The recovery and development of industry have promoted agricultural production, consolidated the worker-peasant alliance, and laid a good foundation for large-scale economic construction.

        Production Volume of Major Industrial Products Exceeds Historical Highs

    The following shows the development of several major state-owned industries (the electricity figures are for Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan, the coal figures are for five state-owned mines, and the cotton yarn and fabric figures are for various state-owned cotton textile factories in Tianjin).

    The output of yarn and cloth surpassed the highest historical levels during the great production competition in June and July 1950. The planned output for 1951 exceeds the actual output for 1950.

    From the statistics above, it is clear that although industry in North China suffered long-term destruction and damage at the hands of the enemy, and the state is currently unable to invest more to increase equipment capacity, the production of major products has already surpassed historical highs. This is mainly due to the increased labor productivity of workers and the improved utilization rate of equipment.

    The degree to which production capacity is utilized (including public and private industrial production) is inconsistent. Major industrial products such as coal, pig iron, steel, and steel ingots have exceeded the "theoretical quotas" of production capacity in 1951 thanks to the workers' wisdom and improvements in machinery, equipment, and operational methods, but some sectors still fall far short. This situation can be illustrated in the following table:

    The paper, flour, cigarette, and match industries have not been able to fully utilize their production capacity. In addition to the insufficient supply of raw materials to guarantee output, a major reason is that the relevant leadership bodies do not have a sufficient estimate of market expansion. After this situation was discovered, the units have revised their production plans, and as a result, actual output has greatly exceeded planned output. For example, the output of matches and cigarettes in Shanxi Province in the first half of 1951 exceeded the total sales volume for the entire year of 1950.

    Private enterprises and handicrafts have also developed considerably. For example, in industries such as burlap sacks, dyeing and printing, oils and fats, and caustic soda, the output of private enterprises accounts for more than 50%. The following shows the recovery and development of public and private enterprises in several industries:

    According to a survey in Tianjin, the number of handicraft households in the first half of 1951 has grown to 308% of the number in 1949.

    With the recovery of production, the living standards of workers have greatly improved. Taking the lives of workers in Shanxi Province as an example: If the wages at the beginning of liberation in 1949 are taken as 100, the average from January to May 1951 has increased to 234.6%; during the same period, worker dormitories increased by 52.5%; state investment in employee welfare in 1951 increased by 67.41% compared to 1950; and labor conditions have also been greatly improved. The number of employee injuries and deaths in 1951 has greatly decreased compared to 1950.

    The recovery and development of industrial production in the past two years has provided great support to agricultural production. In order to support agricultural production, industrial enterprises in Shanxi Province renovated and built 20 factories for agricultural implements, cotton ginning, pesticides, and oil extraction. In order to improve agricultural production technology, various regions in North China have manufactured many new agricultural implements and pesticides, such as waterwheels, new plows, insecticides, sprayers, etc. These have greatly reduced labor in agricultural production and increased yields per unit area. The use of new agricultural implements and the change from three-legged seeders to two-legged seeders are major reasons why agricultural labor model Li Shunda increased production.

    The achievements of industrial production in North China are significant. North China's industry, which suffered greatly under the rule of imperialism and bureaucratic capital, has surpassed and approached the highest production records in history in just over two years after liberation and is changing the proportion of industrial and agricultural production. This proves the superiority of the New Democratic system and proves that the Chinese people, having broken free from the shackles of imperialism, can develop their enterprises more rapidly.

    Main Reasons for the Achievements of Industrial Production in North China

    Except for Suiyuan Province, land reform in North China has long been completed. Agricultural production has approached or exceeded the production levels before the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the purchasing power of farmers has significantly increased. In 1951, the purchasing power of farmers in Shanxi Province increased threefold compared to 1949. Their demand for industrial products is even more urgent, which has strongly stimulated industrial production. The increase in agricultural production has increased the state's agricultural tax revenue, enabling the state to increase orders, which has promoted the recovery and development of industry. The recovery and development of industrial and agricultural production have promoted the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. The vigorous development of the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas has invigorated the urban and rural economies, increased the income of workers and farmers, and also increased the income of the state, giving the state the strength to invest in economic construction.

    After the liberation of major cities in North China, industrial production implemented an independent and autonomous policy of facing the people and facing the domestic market. According to this policy, North China's industry was reorganized. In terms of industrial raw materials, during the Kuomintang rule, tobacco leaves and cotton had to be imported in large quantities from imperialist countries, but now they can basically be self-sufficient. The phenomenon of industrial equipment itself being uncoordinated has been changed or is being changed. North China's technological improvements and the creation and invention of substitutes have also made great achievements. For example, we can now manufacture automobile engines, tractors, 100-horsepower mobile high-speed diesel engines, air compressors, 500-line automatic telephone exchanges, and trolleybuses. These creations and inventions have greatly promoted industrial production in North China.

    In state-owned factories, the policy of relying on the working class and reforming bureaucratic capitalist enterprises into people's enterprises has been implemented. At the beginning of liberation, relying on the masses of workers, the takeover was carried out smoothly and production was quickly restored. Next, a democratic reform struggle was launched against the various unreasonable systems left by the enemy that forced and oppressed workers and suppressed their enthusiasm for production, as well as the bad elements lurking in the factories. Through the democratic reform movement, the broad masses of workers established a sense of ownership of labor, and employee relations, enterprise organizations, wage systems, etc. have also been improved to a certain extent. On this basis, a democratic management system and style were initially established. After the People's Daily published the editorial "Learn to Manage Enterprises" on February 6, 1950, according to production needs and the demands of the masses of workers, enterprises in various regions of North China successively launched a large-scale labor competition movement. This movement further inspired the enthusiasm of the masses of workers, initially reformed labor organization, began rationalization proposals and creative inventions, and initially established production responsibility systems and contract systems. After the production competition, many enterprise units exceeded the highest production records in history, and therefore, they were able to implement initial quotas. At the same time, wage reform work was launched, changing the egalitarian wage system to a wage system with larger differentials based on skill level. Currently, larger enterprise units are carrying out the work of clearing assets and verifying funds. The process of industrial recovery in North China proves that after democratic reforms and the establishment of some necessary management systems, implementing economic accounting and planned management is a more important method for increasing production.

    At the beginning of liberation, the people's government educated private industrialists and businessmen, changed their skeptical and negative attitudes, adjusted labor-capital relations, and changed some unreasonable management systems. After price stabilization last year, false purchasing power was eliminated, and the phenomenon of temporary overstocking of industrial products appeared in the market. In order to help private industrialists and businessmen overcome difficulties, the government processed and ordered goods from them and provided loans; workers voluntarily reduced their wages and returned to their hometowns to launch a production competition movement, enabling private industry to successfully maintain and develop greatly.

    The Direction of Industrial Production Development in North China

    The achievements of industrial production in North China are significant, and the experience is valuable. North China's industry should create greater achievements on the existing foundation.

    Facts have proven that our industrial potential is still very large. For example, after the initial verification of working capital in Shanxi, the first half of 1951 saved 77% compared to the second half of 1949. Adding the sluggish materials from the factories that were being started up exceeded the profits of all state-owned industries in 1949 and 1950. The existing equipment capacity of North China's industry, especially the equipment capacity of light industry, has not been fully utilized. Even the factories and mines that have exceeded the highest historical levels and so-called "theoretical quotas" can continue to improve as long as they fully utilize the wisdom of the working class, unite technical personnel, further improve technology, promptly promote advanced experience, and conscientiously carry out the work of verifying funds and clearing assets. Some state-owned factories in some regions have already begun to do this, but it is not yet common throughout the region. This is the direction of future efforts for industry in North China.

    After land reform and the development of transportation and trade, as long as industrial production faces the people, especially the farmers, the domestic market is very broad. This year's facts have proven that the phenomenon of insufficient industrial products is very significant. According to statistics, the sales volume of coal, matches, cement, cigarettes, and flour in Shanxi in the first half of this year exceeded the production volume, and a situation of supply falling short of demand appeared; matches in Tianjin, which were once overstocked, are now selling well; the large-scale development of handicrafts also illustrates this situation. Therefore, in industrial production, we should face the people, face the domestic market, and adopt various forms, large and small, and actively increase production using the existing conditions. As long as we do this, both public and private enterprises and production cooperatives have broad prospects for development. But it should be pointed out here that state-owned factories should vigorously produce daily necessities and agricultural production materials to meet the needs of the people. The people need industrial products very much, but various industries must also pay attention to ensuring product specifications and reducing costs in order to continue to expand the product sales market.

    In order to complete the above tasks, the focus of leadership must be clearly shifted to industry, a large number of technical personnel must be trained, the ability of existing factory cadres to manage enterprises must be improved, and another group of cadres must be transferred to factories and industrial management agencies to work. In terms of management, we should oppose corruption and waste, promote thrift, continue to save working capital, and start up sluggish materials. At the same time, we should do a good job in making up for the missed lessons of democratic reform, always pay attention to the living conditions and production conditions of workers, continue to strengthen anti-American and aid-Korea ideological education, further rely on the working class, and launch a patriotic labor competition movement to improve industrial production in North China.

　　为进一步提高华北工业生产而奋斗
    李发奎
    华北的工业生产，经过解放以后的大力恢复，现在生产能力已大大超过国民党统治时期，几项主要产品已超过历史上的最高生产水平。公营私营企业和手工业户数都有急剧的增加。华北工农业生产的比重已经起了变化。一九五○年华北工业生产已占工农业生产总值的百分之二十五。察哈尔省在华北是工业生产较少的一省，但一九五○年的工业生产的比重已由一九四九年的百分之一三点二三增加到百分之十六点九八。随着生产的恢复和发展，工人生活已有相当改善，工人失业现象已经消灭。工业的恢复和发展，推动了农业生产，巩固了工农联盟，为大规模的经济建设打下了良好的基础。
        主要工业产品生产量已超过历史上最高纪录
    下面是几种主要国营工业的发展状况（其中电力系北京、天津、唐山三市的数字，煤系国营五个矿的数字，棉纱、布系天津各国营棉纺织厂的数字）。
    纱、布产量在一九五○年六、七月大生产竞赛时，已超过历史上的最高水平。一九五一年的计划产量又超过了一九五○年的实产量。
    从上面统计看来，华北工业虽曾遭受敌人长期摧残和破坏，目前国家还不能以更多的投资去增加设备能力，但主要产品的生产量已经超过了历史上最高纪录。这主要是由于工人劳动生产率与设备利用率提高的结果。
    生产能力发挥程度（包括公、私工业生产）是不一致的。煤、生铁、钢材、钢锭等主要工业产品，由于发挥了工人智慧，改进了机器装备和操作方法，一九五一年的计划产量都已超过生产能力的“理论定额”，但有些部门则还相差很远。这个情况从下表中即可说明：
    纸张、面粉、纸烟、火柴等业尚未能充分发挥生产能力，除掉原料还不足以保证供给外，有关领导机关对市场的扩大无足够估计也是重要原因之一。这种情况被发现后，各单位已重新修正了生产计划，因而实际产量已大大超过计划产量。例如山西省火柴、卷烟业，一九五一年上半年的产量已超过一九五○年全年销售量。
    私营企业和手工业也都有了相当发展。比如麻袋、印染、油脂、火碱等业，私营企业产量占百分之五十以上。下面是几种产业公私营企业恢复发展的情况：
    据天津调查一九五一年上半年的手工业户数已发展到一九四九年的百分之三○八。
    随着生产的恢复，工人的生活水平已有很大提高。以山西省工人生活为例：如以一九四九年解放初期的工资为一○○，一九五一年一至五月平均已增加到百分之二三四点六；在同时期内，工人宿舍增加了百分之五十二点五；国家对职工福利投资，一九五一年较一九五○年增加了百分之六十七点四一；劳动条件也有不少改进，职工伤亡数，一九五一年较一九五○年大大减少。
    两年来工业生产的恢复和发展，给予农业生产以很大的支持。山西省营工业为了支持农业生产，改造和新建了二十个农具、轧花、农药、榨油等工厂。为了改进农业生产技术，华北各地已制造出许多新式农具和农药，如水车、新式步犁、杀虫药剂、喷雾器等等。这些，对于节省农业生产的劳动力和提高单位面积产量有很大作用。使用新式农具，并改三脚耧为两脚耧，是农业劳动模范李顺达提高产量的主要原因之一。
    华北工业生产的成绩是很大的。在帝国主义与官僚资本统治下遭受了很大摧残的华北工业，仅在解放后两年多的过程中，就超过和接近了历史上最高的生产纪录，并且正在改变着工农业生产的比重，这证明了新民主主义制度的优越性，证明了中国人民打破了帝国主义的束缚，就可以把自己的企业更迅速地发展起来。
    华北工业生产取得成绩的主要原因
    华北除绥远省外，土地改革早已结束。农业生产已接近或已超过抗日战争前生产水平，农民购买力已有显著提高。山西省一九五一年农民的购买力已较一九四九年提高三倍。他们对于工业品的要求更加迫切了；这就有力地刺激了工业生产。农业生产的增加，提高了国家的农业税收入，使得国家可能增加订货，这对于工业的恢复发展，起了推动作用。工农业生产的恢复和发展促进了城乡物资交流。城乡物资交流的大力开展，使城乡经济趋于活跃，使工人、农民的收入增加了，同时也增加了国家的收入，这样国家才有力量向经济建设投资。
    华北各大城市解放以后，工业生产就实行了面向人民、面向国内市场的独立自主的方针。根据这一方针，华北工业实行了改组。工业原料方面，在国民党统治时期，烟叶、棉花都要从帝国主义国家大量输入，现在基本上已可以自给自足了。工业设备本身互不协调的现象，已经改变或正在改变着。华北工业技术上的改进和代用品的创造发明，也有很大成绩。例如：汽车引擎、拖拉机、一百匹马力的移动式高速柴油机、空气压缩机、五百门自动交换电话机、无轨电车，我们都能制造了。这些创造发明，对于华北工业生产起了巨大的推动作用。
    在公营工厂中，贯彻了依靠工人阶级，改革官僚资本企业为人民企业的方针。解放初期依靠工人群众，顺利地进行了接收，迅速地恢复了生产。接着对于敌人遗留下的强制压迫工人束缚工人生产积极性的各种不合理的制度，和潜伏在工厂中的坏分子，展开了民主改革斗争。通过民主改革运动，广大工人树立了主人翁的劳动态度，职工关系、企业机构、工资制度等也都有了一定的改进。在这个基础上，初步树立了民主管理制度与作风。一九五○年二月六日，人民日报发表了“学会管理企业”的社论后，根据生产需要及工人群众的要求，华北各地企业先后开展了大规模的劳动竞赛运动。这一运动进一步启发了工人群众的积极性，初步改革了劳动组织，开始了合理化建议与创造发明，并初步建立了生产上的责任制及合同制等。经过生产竞赛，不少企业单位超过了历史上最高生产纪录，因而也就有条件实行初步定额。同时，展开了工资改革工作，把平均主义的工资制度改为级少差大的工资制度。目前较大的企业单位，正进行清理资产、核定资金工作。华北工业恢复的过程证明：经过民主改革和建立一些必要的管理制度以后，实行经济核算和计划管理，乃是提高生产的更重要的方法。
    解放初期，人民政府教育私人工商业者，改变了怀疑和消极态度，调整了劳资关系，改变了某些不合理的管理制度。去年物价稳定以后，虚假购买力消除了，市场上出现了工业品暂时滞销的现象。政府为了帮助私营工商业者克服困难，向他们进行了加工、订货，并给予贷款；工人自动减薪还乡，开展生产竞赛运动，使私营工业顺利地维持下来并得到很大发展。
    华北工业生产的发展方向
    华北工业生产的成绩是很大的，经验也是宝贵的。华北工业应该在现有的基础上创造更大的成绩。
    事实证明了我们的工业潜力还很大，如山西流动资金经过初步核定以后，一九五一年的前半年较一九四九年的后半年节省了百分之七七，加上起动工厂呆滞的物资，就超过了一九四九年和一九五○年全部省营工业的利润。华北工业现有的设备能力，尤其是轻工业的设备能力，尚未充分发挥。就是已经超过历史上最高水平和所谓“理论定额”的厂矿，只要充分发挥工人阶级的智慧，还有可能继续提高。这些，都证明了只要依靠工人，团结技术人员，进一步提高技术，及时推广先进经验，并认真地进行核定资金、清理资产工作，就可以使潜在能力得到充分发挥。这一点，有些地区的公营工厂已经开始进行，但就全区来说还不普遍，这是今后华北工业的努力方向。
    经过土地改革和交通、贸易的发展，工业生产只要是面向人民、尤其是面向农民，国内市场是很宽广的。今年的事实证明工业产品不足的现象是很显著的。据统计，山西的煤炭、火柴、水泥、卷烟、面粉等，今年上半年销售数量均超过生产数量，出现了供不应求的现象；过去天津的火柴曾经滞销，今年已经畅销；手工业的大量发展，也说明了这种情况。因而，我们在工业生产上，应该面向人民，面向国内市场，采取大小不拘，多种多样的形式，利用现有的各种条件，积极增加生产。只要这样作，不论公私营企业和生产合作社，都有广阔发展的前途。但这里应该指出，公营工厂应大力生产日用品和农民生产资料，以适应人民的需要。人民对工业品是很需要的，但各种工业亦须注意保证产品规格并降低成本，以便继续扩大产品销售市场。
    为了完成上述任务，就必须把领导重心明确地转向工业，就必须大量培养技术人才，提高现有工厂干部管理企业的能力，并再抽调一批干部到工厂和工业管理机关去工作。在管理方面，应反对贪污浪费，提倡节约，继续节省流动资金，起动呆滞物资。同时做好民主改革的补课工作，经常注意工人生活条件与生产条件，继续加强抗美援朝思想教育，进一步依靠工人阶级，开展爱国主义劳动竞赛运动，为提高华北工业生产而斗争。
