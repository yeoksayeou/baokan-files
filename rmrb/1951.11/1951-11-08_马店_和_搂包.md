"Ma Dian" and "Lou Bao"
     Shi Geng
    The Deshengmen Guanxiang area of Beijing is the city's center for mule and horse trading. The trade here has always been controlled by the "Ma Dian" and "Lou Bao." For many years, merchants and farmers buying and selling mules and horses here have suffered the cruel exploitation and oppression of the "Ma Dian" and "Lou Bao."
    "Ma Dian" are places where merchants and farmers who buy and sell mules and horses reside, and mule and horse trading also takes place in the "Ma Dian." In name, the "Ma Dian" are intermediaries in mule and horse trading, but in reality, they monopolize and manipulate the entire trading process, preventing buyers and sellers from meeting directly for normal transactions. The "Ma Dian" take a cut of the price, conceal the price, and even forcibly buy at low prices and sell at high prices, from which they obtain illegal profits. In addition, when selling livestock, the "Ma Dian" also use various methods to falsify age by looking at teeth, conceal illnesses and injuries, and pass off old, weak, and disabled livestock as healthy animals. When buying and selling on behalf of customers, in addition to commissions, some "Ma Dian" also extort customers under various pretexts. The "Ma Dian" use a group of "Lou Bao" to go out and solicit and forcibly pull in customers. After a deal is made, the "Lou Bao" share the illegal profits from the shopkeepers, calling themselves "no food in the morning, but horses to ride in the evening."
    Some of the "Ma Dian" managers and "Lou Bao" are also counter-revolutionaries or major despots. They collude with the Japanese puppets and Kuomintang reactionary forces, lording over the masses and doing whatever they want; they cheat, extort, and even plunder merchants who buy and sell mules and horses, seriously hindering urban-rural exchange and disrupting social order. On Deshengmen Guanxiang Street, there are despots such as the "Xu Family Five Tigers," "Wei Family Five Tigers," and "Black Grandfather." The masses say that this street is "Black in the South, Wei in the North, and Xu in the Middle."
    Wei Yongshun, one of the "Wei Family Five Tigers," is a agent of the Central Unification Bureau (a Kuomintang intelligence agency) who served as a puppet Jia chief, Bao chief, "Self-Defense Captain," and "Anti-Communist Captain." Before the liberation of Beijing, he repeatedly gathered bandits to suppress student movements and arrest patriotic students; and led the "Self-Defense Team" to arrest soldiers everywhere, using this as an excuse to extort the masses. In 1948, he arrested Ma Ziren, and the Ma family had to sell all their bedding to raise 600 yuan in puppet "gold yuan coupons" to redeem him. Yu Wenlin's mother went crazy because her son was arrested by Wei Yongshun. Wei Yongshun also took advantage of his power to molest and rape many women. Before the liberation of Beijing, Wei Yongshun took a fancy to a farmer's livestock, said that the farmer was a member of the Eighth Route Army, arrested him, beat him severely, and then forcibly bought his livestock at a low price. After liberation, Wei Yongshun concealed his secret agent organization, hid weapons, and attacked progressive elements among the masses. The masses in Guanxiang hated Wei Yongshun to the bone.
    Ma Xiangpu is a notorious gangster among the horse traders. Before the liberation of Beijing, he consistently colluded with Japanese puppets and Kuomintang bandits, trafficking in drugs and guns, colluding with bandits, distributing stolen goods, extorting money, and raping women. In 1945, he and a Japanese agent arrested and gang-raped a woman surnamed Meng. Ma Xiangpu's wives, Ye and Zhou, were both inhumanely abused by him and then abandoned. Ma Xiangpu consistently manipulated and controlled mule and horse trading, using "secret language" and "hand-pulling" methods to deceive customers. After liberation, he repeatedly obstructed the people's government's reform of mule and horse trading, threatened and provoked traders, and attacked patriotic activists who donated money for airplanes and cannons, attempting to sabotage the movement to donate money for airplanes and cannons.
    Xu Changhai, one of the "Xu Family Five Tigers," also known as the "Northern Overlord," is a fierce thug outside Deshengmen. For decades, he has been running rampant in Guanxiang, bullying and beating people. Wang Hongbin, a resident of Guanxiang, dared not pass Xu Changhai's door for more than ten years. In 1933, Xu Changhai forcibly bought Liu Quan's mule and has not paid a penny to this day. In June of this year, he sold a mule for farmer Jin Rui for 700,000 yuan, but Xu swallowed 300,000 yuan. In July of this year, Jin Xianmou, a farmer from Dongba Town, entrusted Xu Changhai to sell a donkey. Xu Changhai repeatedly lowered the price. Jin Xianmou was anxious to go back and had to sell it for 400,000 yuan. The next day, Xu Changhai made a profit of 250,000 yuan in one fell swoop. Xu Changhai is accustomed to using this method to exploit customers in transactions.
    In addition, Wang Guoxiang, Wang Chunyi, Liu Chunfu, and others are also feudal despots pressing down on the masses in Deshengmen Guanxiang. During the enemy puppet rule, they all colluded with the enemy puppets, purchasing horses for the enemy puppets at low prices, and taking the opportunity to seize the houses of the masses and occupy other people's wives and daughters. Wang Chunyi repeatedly bought sick and disabled mules and horses, falsified their ages, and then sold them at high prices. At the end of last year, he faked the teeth of three old mules and sold them to the troops at high prices. Wang Guoxiang served as a puppet Bao chief before liberation, arresting soldiers several times and disrupting patriotic student parades. After liberation, he repeatedly provoked traders and conspired to obstruct the people's government's reform of the mule and horse trading system.

    “马店”和“搂包”
     石更
    北京市德胜门关厢是全市骡马交易的中心。这里的交易一向被马店和搂包把持。多少年来，在这里买卖骡马的商贩和农民，受尽了马店和搂包残酷的剥削和欺压。
    马店是买卖骡马的商贩及农民寄居的地方，骡马交易也在马店中进行。马店在名义上虽是骡马买卖的中间人，但实际上包揽与操纵了全部交易过程，使买卖双方不能直接见面进行正常交易。马店在交易中吃价、瞒价，甚至以低价强买、高价强卖，从中获得非法的暴利。此外，马店在出卖牲口时还用种种办法，假造口齿、掩饰病伤，把老弱残病的牲畜冒充健壮的牲口出售。马店在代客买卖时，除取得佣金外，有的还用种种名目勒索客人。马店利用一批搂包外出招揽、强拉客人。成交后，搂包们从店家分取非法利润，他们称自己是“早上没饭吃，晚上有马骑”。
    马店经理和“搂包”中还有些是反革命分子或大恶霸。他们勾结日伪和国民党反动势力，在群众头上称雄称霸，为所欲为；对买卖骡马的客商则进行欺诈勒索甚至掠夺，严重地妨碍城乡交流，破坏社会秩序。在德胜门关厢大街上就有“徐家五虎”、“魏家五虎”、“黑太岁”等恶霸。群众说这条大街是“南黑、北魏、中间徐”。
    恶霸“魏家五虎”之一的魏永顺是中统特务分子，曾任伪甲长、保长、“自卫队长”、“清共队长”。北京解放前，他几次纠合匪徒镇压学生运动，逮捕爱国学生；并带领“自卫队”到处抓兵，借此向群众敲诈勒索。一九四八年他抓走麻自仁，麻家把被服当光卖尽后才凑足了六百元伪“金元券”，把人赎回。玉文麟的母亲因为儿子被魏永顺抓走气疯了。魏永顺还仗势调戏、强奸过许多妇女。北京解放前魏永顺因为看上了一个农民的牲口，说这个农民是八路军，把他抓来毒打一顿之后，以低价强买其牲口。解放后，魏永顺隐瞒特务组织，匿藏武器，打击群众中的进步分子。关厢群众对魏永顺恨之入骨。
    马祥普是马行中有名的恶霸流氓头子。北京解放前一贯勾结日伪和国民党匪帮，贩运毒品、枪支，勾结盗匪，分销赃物，勒索钱财，强奸妇女。一九四五年他和日本特务一起逮捕并轮奸一孟姓女子。马祥普的妻子叶氏和周氏都是被他非人地虐待后予以遗弃的。马祥普一贯地操纵把持骡马交易，用“黑话”、“拉手”等办法欺骗顾客。解放后仍一再阻挠人民政府对骡马交易的改革，威胁并挑拨交易员，打击捐献飞机大炮的爱国积极分子，企图破坏捐献飞机大炮运动。
    “徐家五虎”之一的徐长海，又号称“北霸王”，是德胜门外凶恶的打手，几十年来在关厢横行霸道，欺人打人。关厢居民王洪宾十多年不敢经过徐长海的门口。一九三三年，徐长海强买了刘全的骡子，至今分文没给。今年六月代农民靳瑞卖一匹骡子，卖价七十万，但徐吞了三十万元。今年七月东霸镇农民金显谋托徐长海代卖驴子，徐长海将价格一再压低，金显谋因为急于回去，只得以四十万元出售。第二天，徐长海就一转手赚了二十五万元。徐长海在交易中惯于使用这种手段来剥削顾客。
    此外如王国祥、王春义、刘春甫等也是压在德胜门关厢群众头上的封建恶霸。在敌伪统治时期他们都曾勾结敌伪，以低价给敌伪收购马匹，并借势侵占群众房屋，霸占人家妻女。王春义一再收买病残骡马，假造岁齿后以高价出售。去年底曾将三个老骡子作了假口，高价卖给部队。王国祥在解放前任伪保长时，数次抓兵，并破坏爱国学生游行，解放后一再挑拨交易员、阴谋阻挠人民政府对骡马交易制度的改革。
