The Wuchang County Judicial Section of the People's Government, which erroneously handed down a light sentence to the heinous criminal Li Hu氏 [a woman referred to by her family name only] who killed her daughter-in-law in June of last year, and did not even convict the accomplice, has recently corrected its error under the supervision of local masses and the preparatory committees of the All-China and Hubei Democratic Women's Federations. The original verdict was changed, and the principal offender Li Hu氏 was sentenced to death.

Li Hu氏 was a notorious "Mother Tiger" in Li Jiao手 [Jiao Shou] Village, Liangma坊 [Liangma Fang] Township, Sixth District, Wuchang County. She frequently beat and abused her daughter-in-law and relied on the power of her clan to oppress local residents. In 1940, she beat her nine-year-old child bride, Fang Mi伢 [Fang Mi Ya], to death. In June of last year, with the help of her husband, Li Ming聪 [Li Mingcong], and her second son, Li Wen焕 [Li Wenhuan], she beat her eldest daughter-in-law, Tang Xing伢 [Tang Xing Ya], to death. Tang Xing伢 [Tang Xing Ya] came to Li Hu氏's house as a child bride at the age of twelve. Tang Xing伢 [Tang Xing Ya] once tried to commit suicide by jumping into a pond because she could not bear the cruel abuse, but was rescued by a neighbor. In 1948, when Tang Xing伢 [Tang Xing Ya] was seventeen years old, she was forced to marry Li Hu氏's eldest son. A month after the marriage, her husband was conscripted into the Kuomintang bandit army, and Tang Xing伢 [Tang Xing Ya] continued to suffer all kinds of insults and beatings from Li Hu氏. Last June, Tang Xing伢 [Tang Xing Ya] was beaten and scolded by Li Hu氏 for staying one day longer at her parents' home to celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival. Tang Xing伢 [Tang Xing Ya] fled to the Wang Clan Ancestral Hall outside the village to hide, but was chased and dragged back home by Li Hu氏, Li Ming聪 [Li Mingcong], and Li Wen焕 [Li Wenhuan], who beat her along the way. When neighbors came forward to dissuade them, Li Hu氏 said, "This is our family matter, no one can interfere. If I beat her to death, I'll go to jail!" She then closed the door, ordered Li Ming聪 [Li Mingcong] to tie up Tang Xing伢 [Tang Xing Ya], beat Tang Xing伢 [Tang Xing Ya] half to death, and then repeatedly stabbed Tang's lower body with a short wooden stick, causing Tang's death. At that time, Li Ming聪 [Li Mingcong] and others, in order to cover up their crime of murder, even hung the corpse on the stairs to pretend that Tang had committed suicide by hanging. But the truth could not be concealed. The villagers reported the criminal facts of Li Hu氏 to the township and district people's governments. Village Women's Committee member Zhang Xian荣 [Zhang Xianrong], Public Security Assistant Liu Zu邦 [Liu Zubang], and Deputy District Chief of the Sixth District Zhao Qing云 [Zhao Qingyun] went to examine the body three times and found twenty-three places on the deceased's body where the skin was broken and the bones were exposed. Although there were rope marks on the deceased's neck, her tongue was not protruding, indicating that the deceased had not committed suicide by hanging. Li Hu氏 was detained and sent to the District People's Government. During her initial interrogation, Li Hu氏 confessed to the crime. The District Government wrote a report on the case, attached a diagram of the corpse, and handed Li Hu氏 over to the County Judicial Section for handling. Unexpectedly, after Li Hu氏 arrived at the County Judicial Section, she flatly denied the crime, only admitting that she had beaten and scolded her daughter-in-law. The village chief and chairman of the Farmers' Association, who were summoned to testify, lost their position due to Li Ming聪 [Li Mingcong]'s enticements and gave false testimony for Li Hu氏, saying, "Tang Xing伢 [Tang Xing Ya] hanged herself." The County Judicial Section did not conduct an in-depth investigation and research, and determined the case based solely on the confession, concluding that Tang had committed suicide by hanging. Li Hu氏 was sentenced to only one year of imprisonment for the crime of abusing her daughter-in-law. The villagers were greatly dissatisfied with the County Judicial Section's verdict. Some women said, "Beating women to death for no reason without paying with their lives, how can women ever stand up!"

In May of this year, after Li Hu氏 returned home with a release certificate from the Wuchang Prison of the Hubei Provincial People's Court, she cursed at people, saying, "What could you do to me for sending me to the court? Nothing! I had three good meals a day in the old people's home (referring to the prison), and I didn't even want to come back!" This immediately fueled the feudal remnants among the villagers, and some mothers-in-law who often abused their daughters-in-law became even more smug. After studying the matter, Village Women's Committee member Zhang Xian荣 [Zhang Xianrong] and others believed that "the People's Government had mistaken the facts." They saw that the release certificate of Li Hu氏 stated that beating her daughter-in-law to death was judged as abusing her daughter-in-law, so they reported Li Hu氏's crime. Under the supervision of the women masses, the township government sent Li Hu氏 to the District People's Government again. However, Li Ming聪 [Li Mingcong] immediately fabricated a joint letter from farmers to vouch for her. The District Government believed it and released Li Hu氏 the next day. The village women masses were very indignant and insisted on suing. Under their supervision, the township government sent Li Hu氏 to the District People's Government again and then transferred her to the County Judicial Section. On July 6, the chairpersons of the Democratic Women's Federations of all nineteen townships and one town in the district jointly wrote a letter appealing to the prefectural and even the central and southern people's governments, all levels of democratic women's federations, and major newspapers in Wuhan, requesting a retrial of the case. On July 8, an investigation team composed of the preparatory committee of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation Central South Branch, the Hubei Provincial Democratic Women's Federation, the Hubei Provincial Land Reform Committee, and the Hubei Provincial People's Court went to the scene of the incident to conduct an investigation, and finally clarified the facts of the case. Based on the investigation materials, the Wuchang County Judicial Section changed the verdict, sentencing Li Hu氏 to death, Li Ming聪 [Li Mingcong] to five years in prison, and Li Wen焕 [Li Wenhuan] to three years in prison. With the approval of the Central South Branch of the Supreme People's Court, on August 6, a public trial meeting of more than 10,000 people was held in the district, and Li Hu氏 was executed on the spot.

Xinhua News Agency: The Wuchang County People's Government Judicial Section of Hubei Province has conducted a strict self-criticism in accordance with the order of the Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government regarding the erroneous handling of the Li Hu氏 case of killing her daughter-in-law, and has begun to change its past bureaucratic work style. The staff of the Judicial Section of the People's Government of the county, due to insufficient understanding of the important political significance of implementing the Marriage Law, resolutely eliminating the feudal marriage system, and protecting women's rights, failed to conduct in-depth investigation and research on the serious case of the death of Tang Xing伢 [Tang Xing Ya], a woman from Li Jiao手 [Jiao Shou] Village, Sixth District of the county, in June of last year, and lightly believed the defendant's confession and the false testimony of witnesses, committing the error of leniency in sentencing. After repeated reports from the local women masses, the sentence was finally changed, and the murderer Li Hu氏 was sentenced to death. However, during the process of changing the verdict, the cadres of the county's Judicial Section did not conduct a serious ideological examination based on this error, so as to improve their work methods, which led to another incident in which Sun Xing荣 [Sun Xingrong], a farmer in the county, beat his wife to death but was not discovered in time. It was not until late August, when the Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government instructed the county's Judicial Section to conduct a strict self-criticism, that the comrades in the county's judicial work began to pay attention to it. In their self-criticism, they realized that the cause of this error was primarily the serious existence of feudal remnant consciousness in the cadres' minds that ignored women's rights, and that they had not seriously studied the Marriage Law. One staff member of the county who had worked in judicial work for eighteen years under the Kuomintang reactionary government admitted in his self-criticism that when he was handling this case, he did not think of the Marriage Law at all. In his mind, there were still feudal views of the old society, thinking that it was a common thing for mothers-in-law to beat their daughters-in-law and for women to commit suicide, so he did not analyze and research, and handled it carelessly. Secondly, there was serious sloppiness and bureaucracy in the county's judicial work. After this self-criticism, the county's judicial cadres have undergone significant changes in their thinking and work style. Since late September, the county's Judicial Section has organized mobile interrogation and investigation teams for judicial work cadres, cooperating with district and township cadres to go to the countryside to investigate and handle marriage cases. They also publicize the Marriage Law and hold mass meetings for public trials through typical cases. This approach has worked very well. In more than ten days of work, they discovered twelve cases of women being harmed due to marital disputes. After they changed their work style and seriously handled these cases, they have been warmly supported by the women masses. (Xinhua News Agency)

    武昌县司法科纠正重罪轻判的错误
    将杀害儿媳凶犯李胡氏改判死刑
    经过检讨，司法科处理婚姻案件的官僚主义作风大大克服。
    武昌县人民政府司法科曾于去年六月错误地将杀害儿媳的重罪凶犯李胡氏判处轻刑，帮凶就未判罪；在当地群众及中南、湖北民主妇女联合筹委会等督促下，武昌县司法科已在最近纠正错误，改变原判，判处主犯李胡氏死刑。
    李胡氏是武昌县第六区凉马坊乡李脚手村有名的“母老虎”，她经常打骂虐待儿媳，并依仗宗族势力欺压当地居民。一九四零年，她曾把九岁的童养媳方米伢活活打死。去年六月，她又在丈夫李明聪和次子李文焕的帮助下，打死大儿媳汤兴伢。汤兴伢在十二岁时，便到李胡氏家做童养媳。汤兴伢曾因不堪残酷的虐待跳塘寻死，幸被邻人救起。一九四八年，汤兴伢十七岁时，便被迫与李胡氏的大儿子成亲。婚后月余，她的丈夫被国民党匪军抓去当兵，汤兴伢继续受着李胡氏的百般辱骂和殴打。去年六月，汤兴伢因回娘家过端阳节，多住了一天，回来时，便遭到李胡氏毒打和辱骂，汤兴伢逃到村外王氏祠堂里躲避，被李胡氏、李明聪、李文焕三人撵上，并被他们边打边拉地拖回家中，邻人上前解劝时，李胡氏说：“这是我们家事，谁也管不着，打死人，我坐牢！”她遂把房门关起，叫李明聪把汤兴伢捆起，把汤兴伢打得半死，又用短木棒乱捣汤氏的下体，汤氏因而致死。当时李明聪等为掩蔽其杀人罪迹，竟将尸首吊在楼梯上，伪装汤氏是自缢而死的。但事实是瞒不了人的，该村群众纷纷向乡、区人民政府报告李胡氏的犯罪事实。该村妇女委员张先荣、公安助理员刘祖邦、六区副区长赵庆云等先后前往验尸三次，发现死者全身有二十三块破皮露骨的伤处，死者脖子里虽有绳痕，但舌头并未吐出，显然死者并不是自缢而死的，当将李胡氏拘送区人民政府。李胡氏初次被讯时，供认了犯罪事实。区政府就写了案情报告，并附尸体图形，连同李胡氏本人一并交县司法科处理。不料李胡氏到县司法科后，一口抵赖罪行，只承认曾打骂过儿媳。县司法科传去作证的该村村长、农会主席，因受李明聪的拉拢，丧失立场，都为李胡氏作假证明说：“汤兴伢是吊死的。”县司法科没有深入调查研究，单凭口供定案，认定汤氏是自缢而死。李胡氏只以虐待儿媳罪判处徒刑一年。该村群众对县司法科的判决，大为不满。有些妇女说：“平白无故打死妇女，不让偿命，妇女还翻什么身！”
    今年五月，李胡氏带着湖北省人民法院武昌监狱释放证回家后，见人就骂：“你们把老娘弄到法院该怎样呢？没怎样吧！我在养老院（指监狱）每天三顿饭好得很，我还不愿回来呢！”这件事当即助长了该村群众中的封建残余思想，有些经常虐待儿媳的婆婆更得意起来。村妇女委员张先荣等研究后，认为“人民政府把材料搞错了”。她们看到李胡氏的释放证上把打死儿媳判成虐待儿媳，于是纷纷检举李胡氏的犯罪事实。乡政府在妇女群众检举下又把李胡氏送到区人民政府。但李明聪马上捏造了个农民联名信去保，区政府信以为真，次日，便把李胡氏放了回去。该村妇女群众非常激愤坚持控告。乡政府在她们监督下，再次把李胡氏送到区人民政府并转送县司法科。七月六日，全区十九个乡和一个镇的民主妇女联合会主席联名写信，向专区以至中南各级人民政府、各级民主妇联及武汉各大报社呼吁，请求重新判处该案。七月八日，由中南民主妇女联合会筹委会、湖北省民主妇女联合会、湖北省土地改革委员会、湖北省人民法院联合组成的调查组，深入出事地点进行调查，终将案情弄清。武昌县司法科根据调查材料，改判李胡氏死刑、李明聪徒刑五年、李文焕徒刑三年，并经最高人民法院中南分院批准，于八月六日，召开全区一万多人的公审大会，将李胡氏当场枪决。（新华社）
    湖北省武昌县人民政府司法科错误处理李胡氏杀害儿媳案件，已奉中央人民政府最高人民法院命令，进行了严格检讨，并已开始改变过去官僚主义的工作作风。该县人民政府司法科工作人员由于对贯彻执行婚姻法、坚决消灭封建婚姻制度、保障妇女人权这一重大社会改革的严重政治意义认识不足，因此在去年六月对该县六区李脚手村妇女汤兴伢被害致死的重大案件，未进行深入调查研究，即轻信被告口供及证人的假证，犯了重罪轻判的错误。经当地妇女群众一再检举后始行改判，将凶犯李胡氏处以死刑。但在改判过程中，该县司法科干部并没有根据这一错误认真地进行思想上的检查，从而改进自己的工作方法，以致又发生该县农民孙兴荣打死妻子而未能及时发现的事件。直到八月下旬，中央人民政府最高人民法院指令该县司法科严格检讨，这才引起该县司法工作同志的重视。他们在检讨中认识到这次错误发生的原因首先是干部思想里严重地存在着忽视妇女人权的封建残余意识，对婚姻法没有认真学习。该县曾经在国民党反动政府干过十八年司法工作的一个工作人员，在检讨自己的错误时承认，当他承理这一案件时，完全没有想到婚姻法，在他思想里仍然存在着旧社会的封建观点，认为公婆打媳妇和妇女自杀是件平常的事，因此便不加分析研究，草率处理。其次是该县在司法工作上存在着严重的粗枝大叶与官僚主义作风。经过这次检讨，该县司法干部已在思想上和作风上起了显著的变化。从九月下旬起，该县司法科将司法工作干部组织了流动审讯调查小组，配合区、乡村干部，下乡调查与办理婚姻案件。他们并通过典型案件，宣传婚姻法，召开群众会公开审讯。这种作法效果很好。在十多天的工作中，他们就发现了十二个妇女因婚姻纠纷而遭伤害的案件。他们改变工作作风认真处理这些案件后，已受到妇女群众的热烈拥护。
