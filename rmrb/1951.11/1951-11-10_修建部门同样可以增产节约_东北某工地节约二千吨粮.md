    Construction Departments Can Also Increase Production and Practice Economy
    A Construction Site in Northeast China Saves 2,000 Tons of Grain
    The staff and workers in a construction area in Northeast China increased production and practiced economy to the tune of two thousand tons of grain in two months. This fact demonstrates that savings can also be made in the construction sector. The leading cadres of the construction site attached importance to ideological education and democratic management, and proposed to all staff and workers the slogan "Half a catty of rice for a red brick, two catties of flour for a catty of cement"; all staff and workers launched a campaign to eliminate waste and ensure quality. Everyone came up with many good ideas. For example, each numbered project was arranged in an orderly manner according to the needs and quantity of materials, and the location of the material pile was determined according to the needs of the project progress, which eliminated the waste of manual handling. According to preliminary statistics, the construction site has saved 753,870 red bricks, 341 tons of cement, and 240 cubic meters of wood, totaling 2,000 tons of grain. Now everyone is determined to strive to save 3,500 tons of grain. (Zhou Sheng)

    修建部门同样可以增产节约
    东北某工地节约二千吨粮
    东北某施工地区的职工，在两个月中增产节约了两千吨粮食。这一事实，说明在修建部门同样是可以节约的。该工地领导干部重视思想教育与民主管理，向全体职工提出“一块红砖半斤米，一斤洋灰二斤面”的口号；全体职工展开消灭浪费，保证质量运动。大家想出了很多好办法。例如，在每一编号工程上，按照需要情况和材料数量作有次序的摆列，并按工程进度的需要来决定堆料位置，免去了人工往来搬运的浪费。根据初步统计，该工地已节省了红砖七十五万三千八百七十块，洋灰三百四十一吨，木材二百四十立方公尺，共折粮食二千吨。现在大家决心要为争取节约三千五百吨粮食而奋斗。（周生）
