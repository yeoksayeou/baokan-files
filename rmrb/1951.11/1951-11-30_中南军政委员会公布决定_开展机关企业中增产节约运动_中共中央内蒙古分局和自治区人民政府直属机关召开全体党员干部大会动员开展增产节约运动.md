Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 29th. The Central and South Military and Political Committee announced on the 28th of this month the decision to launch a production increase and savings movement in government organs and enterprises. This decision was discussed and approved by the fourth plenary session of the Central and South Military and Political Committee. Its main contents are:

Regarding the launch of the production increase and savings movement in state-owned enterprises and institutions, the decision emphasizes the need to mobilize workers, technicians, and staff in these enterprises and organs to launch an anti-waste struggle, promote rationalization proposals, and protect and save state property. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen economic accounting and cash management, accelerate the turnover of commodities and funds, and reduce commodity costs. Employees who have made achievements in improving technology and increasing equipment utilization should be rewarded. The main focus of the financial departments should be on rectifying tax collection, preventing tax evasion, and strengthening the management of granaries.

In terms of streamlining organizations and staffing, it is necessary to eliminate the phenomenon of overlapping organs. Merge redundant organs and reduce levels; streamline general staff and support personnel to strengthen operational units, and transfer surplus personnel to financial and economic and cultural and educational work posts in an organized manner; strive to simplify various work systems and procedures, thoroughly rectify writing style, and overcome bureaucracy.

The decision stipulates that all kinds of meetings should avoid extravagance and waste; mutual gifts and banquets are prohibited for joyous occasions, funerals, and festivals. The decision calls on cadres and employees of all organs and state-owned enterprises in the Central and South region to promote the revolutionary tradition of hard work and plain living. Extravagant and wasteful behaviors such as large-scale construction and replacing old with new are strictly prohibited; the purchase of equipment, facilities, daily necessities, etc., must be done with domestically produced goods as much as possible, and the utilization of waste materials should be promoted.

Regarding the rectification of organ production, the decision stipulates that organ production committees should be established at all levels immediately to clear up production funds and shift the previous chaotic situation of independent operation to unified leadership and unified operation.

In order to strengthen the organizational leadership of this movement, the decision stipulates that all levels of organs and enterprises in the Central and South region should establish streamlining and savings committees or streamlining and savings groups, formulate and control production increase and savings plans, and organize inspections on time. Leaders at all levels and in all departments should personally take action and set an example, combine with the revision of patriotic covenants, and widely and deeply carry out education and mobilization work to create a mass production increase and savings movement and social atmosphere.

The decision also stipulates that financial and economic discipline should be rectified, and the masses should be mobilized to report acts of corruption and waste; the Central and South Administrative Region and the provincial (municipal) levels should establish "joint inspection groups for rectifying financial and economic discipline" to conduct key inspections in various organs, enterprises, and organizations.

In addition: The Streamlining and Savings Committee of the Central and South Military and Political Committee was established on the 24th. Deng Zihui is the chairman, and Zhang Zhiyi, Zeng Yifan, Fan Xingzhi, and Tang Xing are the vice chairmen.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 28th. The directly affiliated organs of the Inner Mongolia Branch of the CCP Central Committee and the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region held a general assembly of all Party members and cadres on November 26. Ulanhu, Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Branch of the CCP Central Committee, made a mobilization report on launching a production increase and savings movement at the meeting, calling on all Communist Party members, cadres, and people of all ethnic groups and all sectors in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to respond to Chairman Mao's call for production increase and savings with practical actions.

Regarding the methods and plans for comprehensively launching production increase and savings, Ulanhu pointed out that all organs of the People's Government, the CCP Party Committee, and people's organizations in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region should streamline their organizations, reduce levels, improve work efficiency, and eliminate the waste of having more people than necessary. All expenditure should be carefully calculated, and extravagance and waste should be opposed. Ulanhu called on leading cadres of all organs to personally take action and mobilize all staff to start from the big picture and from small things, and strictly implement streamlining and savings. All state-owned and public-owned enterprises, industry and commerce, trade, cooperatives, and other economic work organs should seriously clear up assets, verify funds, improve management and operation, accelerate capital turnover, reduce costs, and eliminate waste. At the same time, in the production increase and savings movement, it is necessary to carry out production competitions, improve product quality and quantity, and create and accumulate more wealth for the country. In terms of agricultural production, it is necessary to continue to improve cultivation techniques, prevent disasters, and achieve an increase of 150 jin of grain per hectare of cultivated land throughout the region next year. Cadres in various localities must currently further organize the masses to transport salt, hunt, collect mountain dried and fresh goods, collect medicinal materials, raise chickens and pigs, clean up forest farms, and utilize waste materials, so that production increase and savings are closely combined with disaster relief and famine relief. In terms of animal husbandry, it is necessary to protect livestock to safely overwinter and utilize all livestock products. If the above tasks are accomplished, the total value of production increase and savings in the entire region in the coming year will be 450,000 tons of grain. Ulanhu finally emphasized that in order to complete this task in the context of Inner Mongolia's severe drought this year, all Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and all revolutionary workers in the region must, with the highest enthusiasm for being responsible to the people, in a planned and leadership-driven manner, deeply mobilize the masses, highly develop the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses, strengthen the confidence in production increase and savings, disaster relief and famine relief, and at the same time launch a mass struggle against corruption, waste, bureaucracy, and other undesirable tendencies.
