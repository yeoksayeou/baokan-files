    Business Press's Response and Self-Criticism Regarding the Publication of "Cooperative"
    Editor: The criticisms made by Comrades Jin and Song regarding the small booklet "Cooperative" published by our press last year are basically correct. The content of this booklet does contain errors.

    Our press has published over 15,000 books, and we are currently conducting a review of old books, and have decided to destroy or thoroughly revise a significant number of them. The Editorial Department was reorganized only in March of this year. We have not yet had time to review last year's publications, which has resulted in this booklet still being in circulation. This is our mistake. Now, we are notifying distribution organizations to stop selling this book, and at the same time, we will expedite the review of our existing publications and strive to improve the quality of new books to thank Comrades Jin and Song for their criticism. Business Press Editorial Department

    商务印书馆对出版“合作社”一书的答复和检讨
    编辑同志：金、宋两同志对于去年我馆出版的一本小册子“合作社”的批评基本上是正确的。这本小册子的内容是有错误的。
    我馆曾经出版过一万五千多种书，现正在进行检查旧书的工作，决定销毁或彻底修改的书为数已不少。编审部是今年三月才改组的。还没有来得及检查去年的出版物，以致让这本小册子尚在流行，这是我们的错误。现在，我们一面通知发行机构将此书停售，一面当加紧检查我们的旧有出版物，并且尽力提高新书的质量，来答谢金、宋两同志的批评。　商务印书馆编审部
