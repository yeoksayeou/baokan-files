Xinhua News Agency, New York, 3rd: According to TASS, the Communist Party of the United States published an open letter to the US Secretary of State Acheson on October 17th, putting forward a six-point peace plan and demanding that the US government immediately stop the Korean War.

The Communist Party of the United States first expressed its support in the letter for the demands of all peace-loving people in the United States for a swift end to the Korean War, believing that "there should be no obstacles in the way of ending this unnecessary, unjust, and dangerous war."

The Communist Party of the United States believes that the US military's brutal atrocities against Korean civilians are a disgrace to the American people, and these atrocities have aroused the indignation of international public opinion.

The Communist Party of the United States pointed out that throughout the armistice negotiations, it was repeatedly demonstrated that the US side had no sincerity in the negotiations. While conducting negotiations, it also sabotaged the negotiations and continued military operations. Ridgway's representatives first interrupted the negotiations on trivial pretexts. Later, the troops under Ridgway's command created a series of provocations that undermined the neutral zone and even infringed upon the sovereignty of the People's Republic of China.

In the letter, the Communist Party of the United States proposed a six-point plan to Acheson and the US government, demanding an immediate end to the Korean War:

First, nothing should be allowed to hinder an immediate ceasefire in Korea and a peaceful settlement of the Korean War; continue to make every effort to negotiate with the Korean representatives, and never stop until an agreement is reached.

Second, establish the necessary guarantees to prevent a recurrence of incidents in which Ridgway-commanded troops sabotage the neutral zone. If Ridgway does not fulfill this obligation, he should be recalled immediately.

Third, instruct the US military in the region to cease all offensive military operations, thereby saving the lives of American soldiers and the lives of Koreans.

Fourth, fulfill the obligations of the United Nations, that the 38th parallel should serve as the basis for a ceasefire line.

Fifth, immediately formulate a plan for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, so that the Korean people can reunify their country in a democratic manner.

Sixth, the United States Senate should postpone the ratification of the current peace treaty with Japan, so that China and the Soviet Union can fully participate in the final adoption of a peace treaty with Japan in a form that satisfies the people of the world.

Finally, the Communist Party of the United States also called for negotiations with the People's Republic of China to resolve all disputes in the Far East, to accept the representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate in the United Nations, and to conclude a peace pact among the five major powers.

    美共致函艾奇逊提出六点方案
    要求立即停止侵朝战争
    不容许李奇微阻碍与破坏停战谈判
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：美国共产党在十月十七日发表致美国国务卿艾奇逊的一封公开信，提出六点和平方案，要求美国政府立即停止朝鲜战争。
    美国共产党在信中首先表示赞成美国全体爱好和平的人们所提出的迅速停止朝鲜战争的要求，认为“在停止这个无需有的、非正义的、危险的战争的道路上，不应有任何障碍”。
    美国共产党认为侵朝美军对朝鲜平民的残酷暴行是美国人民的耻辱，这种暴行已经激起国际舆论的愤慨。
    美国共产党指出：在整个停战谈判过程中，在在都表示美国方面对谈判毫无诚意。它一方面进行谈判，一方面却又破坏谈判而继续军事行动。李奇微的代表首先以微不足道的藉口中断了谈判，后来，李奇微指挥下的军队又制造出一连串的破坏中立区的挑衅事件，甚至侵犯中华人民共和国的主权。
    美国共产党在信中向艾奇逊和美国政府提出六点方案，要求立即停止朝鲜战争：
    第一，不容许任何事情阻碍在朝鲜立即停火及朝鲜战争的和平解决；继续作一切努力，以与朝鲜代表进行谈判，不达协议，决不停止。
    第二，确立必要的保证以防止李奇微指挥的军队破坏中立区的事件重演。如果李奇微不执行这个义务，应立即把他召回。
    第三，训令美国在这个区域的军队停止一切进攻的军事行动，从而拯救美国士兵的性命与朝鲜人的性命。
    第四，执行联合国的义务，即三八线应作为停火线的基础。
    第五，立即拟定一切外国军队撤出朝鲜的办法，使朝鲜人民得以按民主方式重新统一自己的国家。
    第六，使美国参议院暂缓批准现在的对日和约，以便使中国与苏联有可能充分参加最后通过以全世界人民满意的形式制定的对日和约的工作。
    美国共产党最后并呼吁与中华人民共和国就解决远东的一切分歧开始谈判，接纳中华人民共和国的代表参加联合国，并缔结五大国和平公约。
