    [This newspaper dispatch] The Chinese People's Relief Administration remitted 10,000 US dollars (equivalent to 3,600,000 Japanese yen) to the innocent defendants and their families of the Japanese "Matsukawa Incident" on September 12 to support their just struggle. The funds were transferred on their behalf by the Japan Labor-Farmer Relief Association. Recently, the People's Relief Administration received a reply letter from Tatsuji Fuse, Chairman of the Japan Labor-Farmer Relief Association, and letters from Saito Sen, Sugiura Saburo, and Sato Hajime, three innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident," stating that the net amount after deducting remittance fees was 3,041,985.92 Japanese yen, and the full amount was received at the end of September. They unanimously thanked the Chinese people for their assistance. Song Qingling, Chairman of the People's Relief Administration, also wrote a letter to all the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" on the 9th of this month. The letter stated: "We have read the reply letter from the Labor-Farmer Relief Association and the letters from Saito Sen, Sugiura Saburo, and Sato Hajime, and we know that you have received the three million yen given by the Chinese People's Relief Administration to the innocent defendants and their families in the 'Matsukawa Incident.' We sincerely hope that this sum will help you in your struggle for peace and truth.
    At a time when the world's people's movement for peace is flourishing, and the US imperialists are carrying out a cruel war of aggression against the Korean people, concluding a separate 'peace treaty' with Japan, and plotting to arm Japan, seriously undermining peace and security in Asia and the world, your anti-oppression struggle for world peace and national independence represents the true will of the broad masses of Japanese working people. You are not isolated, and all peace-loving people in China, Asia, and the world are willing to be your backing. The victory of justice will surely belong to you."
    The assistance given by the Chinese People's Relief Administration to the innocent defendants in the Japanese "Matsukawa Incident" has inspired and strengthened their will and confidence in the struggle. Saito Sen, Sugiura Saburo, and Sato Hajime, three innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident," expressed their infinite gratitude and thanks to the Chinese people in their letters to Song Qingling, Chairman of our country's People's Relief Administration. Saito Sen said in his letter: "When 475 million Chinese brothers and sisters are carrying out the great Resist-US, Aid-Korea movement and the New Democracy construction work, being able to send us money accumulated with blood and sweat is to explain to the whole world: the victory of the 'Matsukawa Incident' will surely belong to us." Sugiura Saburo said in his letter: "Before the second trial, we were able to receive such great assistance, which truly made us feel the light immediately in prison. This has further strengthened our confidence in winning the second trial." Sato Hajime said in his letter that at a time when their economic and physical conditions were very poor, and their families were suffering economically because they had lost their source of livelihood for more than two years, the material assistance from the Chinese people was very valuable.

    中国人民救济总会主席宋庆龄
    写信支援“松川事件”无辜被告
    斋藤千等答谢人民救济总会的物质援助
    【本报讯】中国人民救济总会曾于九月十二日汇给日本“松川事件”无辜被告及其家属一万美元（折合三百六十万日圆）以支援他们的正义斗争。该款系由日本劳农救援会代转。最近，人民救济总会接到日本劳农救援会会长布施辰治的复信和“松川事件”无辜被告斋藤千、杉浦三郎、佐藤一等三人的来信，说明该款扣除汇费后净数为日圆三百零四万一千九百八十五圆九角二分，已于九月底全数收到。他们一致感谢中国人民给予他们的援助。人民救济总会主席宋庆龄并于本月九日写信给“松川事件”全体无辜被告。该信称： “我们接读劳农救援会的复信和斋藤千、杉浦三郎和佐藤一三位的来信，知道你们已经收到中国人民救济总会赠与‘松川事件’无辜被告及其家属的三百万日元。我们热诚希望这笔款项能有助于你们为和平与真理的斗争。
    正当全世界人民要求和平的运动蓬勃开展，而美帝国主义者却向朝鲜人民进行残酷的侵略战争，缔结单独对日‘和约’，阴谋武装日本，严重地破坏着亚洲和世界的和平与安全的时候，你们为争取世界和平、民族独立的反压迫斗争，代表着日本广大劳动人民的真正意志。你们绝不是孤立的，全中国、全亚洲和全世界爱好和平的人民都愿做你们的后盾。正义的胜利一定是属于你们的。”
    中国人民救济总会给予日本“松川事件”无辜被告的援助，激励与增强了他们斗争的意志与信心。“松川事件”无辜被告斋藤千、杉浦三郎和佐藤一等三人在给我国人民救济总会主席宋庆龄的信中，对中国人民表示无限的感激和谢意。斋藤千的信中说：“四亿七千五百万的中国兄弟姐妹们在进行着伟大的抗美援朝运动和新民主主义建设工作的时候，能把用血汗积累起来的钱寄给我们，这就是向全世界说明：‘松川事件’的胜利一定是属于我们的。”杉浦三郎的信中说：“在第二审之前，我们能得到这样大的援助，真使我们在监牢里立刻感到了光明。这使我们越发加强了在第二审时获得胜利的信心。”佐藤一的信中表示：正当他们的经济和身体都处于非常恶劣的情况下、他们的家属因为二年多来失去生活的依靠而经济上十分困难的时候，得到了中国人民的物质援助，是非常宝贵的。
