    Studying to Transform Myself and Better Serve the Motherland
    By Qián Duānshēng, Dean of the Law School of Peking University

    From liberation until now, the time has not been short, but my progress has been very small and slow. I now realize that this is because I have not paid enough attention to studying, and I have also adopted an incorrect and un-humble attitude.

    I have the ideological consciousness of a petty-bourgeois intellectual. As for the influence of bourgeois education, it may have been greater on me than on the average old intellectual. But until recently, I was numb. I thought that seven or eight years ago, I had already abandoned old democracy and individualism. After liberation, I thought that I was following Chairman Mao and the Communist Party wholeheartedly. All I needed was to read more books on Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, to learn more about the Communist Party's policies, and to learn more from the Communist Party's style of work. Thus, at the beginning of liberation, I only wanted to read new books. Later, when work affected my reading, I only wanted to seek progress from work. I was convinced that doing so would allow me to transform myself steadily.

    But I was wrong, I was greatly wrong. An old intellectual like me cannot be transformed so easily. Unless the old is removed first, the new cannot enter. And what is old and bad is often unclear to oneself. After a relatively deep reflection in the revolutionary practice of land reform, I had a relatively deep understanding of the mistakes I had made before liberation and the shortcomings that still remained after liberation. These mistakes should not be excused with lame reasons such as "circumstances made it so" or "good intentions," and these shortcomings should not be obscured by the illusion of making progress, without being discovered and corrected promptly. What is particularly worth pointing out is that although the more I reflected, the more I discovered, and the more ashamed I became, I was often unable to feel many shortcomings myself. It was not until the land reform work was about to end, in criticism and self-criticism, that I began to recognize these shortcomings. For example, I have always considered myself a person with a strong sense of responsibility and not subjective, but when many comrades in the land reform work openly criticized my subjectivity, I felt that I had a serious problem of insisting on my own opinions. After experiencing the sharpness of the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, I regretted that I had not learned to use this weapon earlier, and I suddenly realized that not only is simply reading books on Marxism-Leninism academic and divorced from reality, but simply trying to improve one's work style is also unsuccessful. Neither of these are the correct attitude and effective method of study. One must read books and be able to relate them to oneself and to reality, and adopt the method of criticism and self-criticism to expose shortcomings, in order to truly distinguish between the old and the new, between right and wrong, between good and bad, and only then can one truly transform oneself and make progress.

    It is on the basis of such an initial awakening that I welcome the study movement for teachers in institutions of higher learning. I wholeheartedly accept all the instructions given to us by Premier Zhou in his report, especially regarding the use of the weapon of criticism and self-criticism.

    It must be admitted that not only was my teaching work basically based on personal interests before liberation, following the bourgeois ideological path, and objectively serving the reactionary ruling class; after liberation, because my old ideological consciousness still existed, my work at Peking University still fully demonstrated the thoughts and styles of the old intellectuals in many aspects.

    One of the most basic conditions for a people's teacher is to teach classes conscientiously, but I did not do a good job of teaching the courses conscientiously. Since liberation, I have taught courses such as "On New Democracy" (political class), "The Chinese Government" (which should be correctly named "The National Law of the People's Republic of China"), and "Capitalist Countries." I did not do my best to enrich the teaching materials, I did not make great efforts to help students study on their own, and I did not strictly implement the planned teaching plan. I was not responsible enough to the students and to the people.

    I did not connect well with the masses. My contact with students and colleagues was very inadequate; my understanding of their ideological situation was indirect and often one-sided. I did not understand the students' requirements for course content and teaching methods; I either did not understand the colleagues' needs in their work, whether in terms of library equipment or contact with government business departments, or even if I did understand, I never actively and thoroughly solved problems for them. Since I was divorced from the masses, I inevitably developed a serious style of bureaucracy and commandism.

    I did not unite well with my colleagues. The three departments of the Law School of Peking University—law, political science, and economics—each had internal disunity, and there was also a lack of contact and mutual care between the departments. I often felt that these disunities were a bother to me, so I always adopted a sporadic attitude towards unity work, lacking patience and even less persistence. Sometimes I would even be arrogant in my heart, not only not solving problems, but also looking down on other people's disunity. At one time, I myself had disagreements with Fan Hong, the director of the Economics Department. I thought that his stubbornness and departmentalism were the reason for the discord, and I never reflected on whether I also had a bad attitude or unreasonable opinions. And even if I was reasonable in every way (which, of course, could not be the case), I never patiently tried to persuade Director Fan Hong.

    I have insisted on resigning from the post of Dean of the Law School for nearly a year. Although I put forward various reasons that I thought were sufficient at the time, requesting the school and the Ministry of Education to allow me to resign, I never asked myself before participating in the land reform work whether the old guy of personal interest was at work again. I thought that since a friend had sternly criticized my "concessions" last summer, I had been able to accept all the positions assigned to me by the higher authorities or that people's organizations wanted me to hold, without considering my interests. However, since I had discovered during the land reform period that I had many shortcomings in my thoughts that I was determined to change but that often still manifested themselves in my actions, I could not help but associate the problem of personal interest with the real reason why I wanted to resign as Dean of the Law School. Regarding this point, I still cannot clearly distinguish it myself, and I ask my colleagues to offer me stern criticism. No matter what my motives were, because I insisted on resigning, I did not inquire about the affairs of the college for a year, even when I was in Beijing, allowing the Law School to incur losses in its work, which is my unforgivable mistake.

    From my handling of the school affairs of Peking University, I also fully demonstrated the bad thoughts and styles of the old intellectuals. Before this summer, the School Affairs Committee was responsible for leading the school affairs, and I was one of the standing committee members. I was either hot for a while, then cold for a while; either impatient, or passive. I exposed the typical weaknesses of intellectuals from petty-bourgeois backgrounds. I did not connect with the masses, I did not adhere to the truth, so that I did not play the role that I should have played in the steady improvement of school affairs.

    Here, it should also be pointed out that Mr. Tang Yongtong, the former chairman of the School Affairs Committee, bears a greater responsibility than me. Mr. Tang has always been wise and protective of himself, never arguing with others, and never easily expressing his approval or disapproval on difficult matters. Under his leadership, the freedom and laxity that have long existed in Peking University have not been fundamentally corrected. Since Mr. Tang took office as Vice President, his style has improved somewhat, but it is still not enough. If I had always been truly responsible to the people, I should have criticized him face-to-face or publicly long ago, pointed out his shortcomings, and asked him to strengthen his leadership so that the improvement of school affairs could be more and faster. But for the sake of face, and for the sake of personal feelings, I had never done this before. This also shows what kind of old intellectual I am.

    Mr. Cai Yuanpei is to blame for the freedom and laxity of Peking University, and the older generation of teachers who have long retained his main educational thoughts at Peking University—the so-called "freedom of thought" and "academic freedom"—including myself, should bear greater responsibility. The thoughts and academics of the people should be free. However, during Mr. Cai's tenure as president, the concrete manifestation of freedom of thought was "compatibility and inclusiveness," and the more concrete manifestation was that bourgeois thought occupied a dominant position. In the university of a new democratic country, if someone attempts to contend with the ideology of the working class with the bourgeois ideology that occupied a dominant position in those years, is it permissible? I think it is not permissible. As for "academic freedom," not only was it divorced from reality from the beginning, but later it evolved into the separation of powers between departments, as well as the opposition between academics and politics, the opposition between technology and politics, and various serious erroneous thoughts such as academics for the sake of academics, which have not yet been eradicated.

    People who have graduated from Peking University and people who have worked at Peking University for many years are easily confused by the glorious tradition of Peking University. It should be asked, apart from the May Fourth Movement, where exactly is the glorious tradition of Peking University? Yes, in the December 9th Movement, the December 1st Movement, and the movement against the atrocities of the US military at the end of 1946, as well as in other student movements led by the Chinese Communist Party, our students at Peking University were all standing at the forefront of the battle line. However, were not the students of other schools also standing at the forefront? Even with regard to the May Fourth Movement, it was indeed first launched at Peking University, and there were especially many teachers and students at Peking University who led or participated in it, but in order to inherit the glorious tradition of the May Fourth Movement, we teachers must first distinguish between the revolutionary thoughts of the May Fourth Movement and the reactionary thoughts of the right-wing elements of the May Fourth Movement. In addition to declaring Hu Shi's thoughts as the thoughts of the enemy, we should also carefully criticize Cai Yuanpei's thoughts and the influence of these thoughts that remain among us.

    From the shortcomings I have discovered in my work at Peking University after liberation, which have been pointed out above, it can be fully seen how seriously my old style exists, and it can also fully illustrate how my old thoughts of liberalism and individualism are at work. Of course, these shortcomings are only a part of the shortcomings that exist. Deeper self-examination and criticism from others will reveal more and more serious shortcomings. I want to constantly make self-examinations regardless of face, not only examining my shortcomings in my work at Peking University, but also examining the serious mistakes I made before liberation. I should welcome others to offer me ruthless and sharp criticism. And I hope to be able to criticize others in the same way. I firmly believe that mutual criticism is mutual help, which is the only effective way to transform our thinking.

    In order to seek my own progress, in order to reform higher education, and more importantly, in order to be worthy of the people and Chairman Mao, let us teachers in institutions of higher learning throw ourselves into the high tide of the movement of self-education and self-transformation carried out by the method of criticism and self-criticism with the most enthusiastic emotions!

    为改造自己更好地服务祖国而学习
    北京大学法学院院长  钱端升
    从解放到现在，时间过得不算短，但是我的进步是很小很慢的。我现在体会到，这是由于我对学习不够重视，而且还采取了不正确不虚心的态度。
    我有一般小资产阶级出身的知识分子的思想意识。至于资产阶级的教育的影响，对于我可能比一般旧知识分子更要大些。但在不久以前，我是麻痹的。我自以为在七八年前，我已经抛弃了旧民主主义和个人主义。解放以后，我自以为一心一意地在跟着毛主席、共产党走。我所需要的只是多读马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的书籍，多了解共产党的政策，多学习共产党员的作风而已。于是解放之初，我单单想读新书，以后工作影响了我的读书时，则单单想从工作中求进步。我满以为这样做便可稳步前进地自我改造。
    可是我错了，我大大地错了。像我这样一个旧知识分子决不是这样的容易改造得过来的。旧的不先除掉，新的是进不来的。而什么是旧的、坏的，自己往往是模糊不清的。在土地改革的革命实践中作了比较深刻的反省后，我才比较深刻地认识了解放以前我犯过的错误，和解放以后仍然遗留着的缺点。这种错误是不应当以“环境使然”或“动机良好”等等没出息的理由来自宥的；这种缺点也是不应当被自以为正在进步的错觉所蒙蔽，而不及时发掘并迅速纠正的。尤其值得指出的是，尽管我愈勤反省，愈多发觉，愈增惭愧，但对于很多缺点，我自己是常常感觉不到的。到了土地改革工作将要结束，在批评自我批评中，我才开始认识到这种缺点。举一个例子：我向来自以为是一个责任心很重而并不主观的人，但很多土地改革工作的同志们公开地批评了我的主观时，我就感觉到我有好坚持己见的严重毛病。我体验到批评自我批评这一武器的锐利后，我懊悔我未能及早地学会使用这一武器，我更恍然大悟，不但单单读马克思列宁主义的书籍是学院式的，脱离实际的；单单想从工作中改善作风也是不能成功的，两者都不是正确的学习态度和有效的学习方法。必须读书而能联系自己，联系实际，又采用了批评自我批评的方法，以求暴露缺点，才能真正分辨新旧，分辨是非，分辨好歹，方能真正改造自己，取得进步。
    我是在这样一个可说是初步觉悟的基础之上来欢迎高等学校教师的学习运动的。我衷心地接受了周总理给我们所作报告中的一切指示，尤其是关于批评自我批评这一武器的使用。
    应当承认，不但在解放以前我的教学工作基本上是从个人的利益出发的，是遵循着资产阶级的思想道路的，客观上是为反动统治阶级服务的；那在解放以后，因为我的旧思想意识仍然存在，我在北京大学的工作，在很多的方面，仍充分表现了旧知识分子的思想和作风。
    作为人民教师的最起码条件之一是认真教课，但我没有认真将功课教好。解放以来，我教过“新民主主义论”（政治课），“中国政府”（应当正名为“中华人民共和国国家法”）和“资本主义国家”等课。我没有尽我的能力以使教材充实，没有以大力帮助学生自学，也没有严格地执行预定的教学计划。我是不够对学生、对人民负责的。
    我没有好好地联系群众。我和同学同仁间的联系都是很不够的；对于他们的思想情况，我的了解是间接的，也往往是片面的。同学们对课程内容和教学方法上的要求，我是不够了解的；同事们对工作上的需要，无论在图书设备方面，或和政府业务部门的联系方面，我或者是不了解，即使有些了解，也从没有积极地、贯彻地为他们解决问题。既然脱离了群众，也无可避免地产生了严重的官僚主义、命令主义的作风。
    我没有好好地团结同仁。北京大学法学院的三个系——法律、政治、经济——个个系内部闹不团结，系与系之间也缺乏联系和互相照顾。我经常觉得这些不团结对于我是一种麻烦，因此对于团结的工作，总是采取一曝十寒的态度，缺乏耐心，更不坚持。有时我内心上还会自高自大，不但不去解决问题，反而瞧不起人家的闹不团结。在有一个时期，我自己和经济系樊弘主任之间也闹意见。我认为他的固执和本位主义是不和洽的原因，我从不反躬自省，问一问我自己是否也有态度不好或者主张不合理的地方。而且即使我是处处合理（当然决不能是这样），我也从没有耐心地去说服樊弘主任。
    我对法学院院长一职坚持辞去不干也近一年之久。尽管我当时提出种种自以为是充分的理由，要求学校和教育部允许我辞职，但在参加土地改革工作以前，我从没有问过自己，是不是个人的兴趣这一老家伙又在作祟。我自以为自从前年夏天有一位朋友严正地批评了我的“退让”后，我已经能够不考虑兴趣而接受上级所交给我的或是人民团体所要我担任的一切职务了。但是，在土地改革期中我既已发觉我有着许许多多思想上虽然坚决要改掉而行动上又往往表现仍然存在的缺点，我就不能不连想到个人兴趣问题可能就是我要辞去法学院院长的真实原因。关于这一点，我自己至今尚不能分辨清楚，我要求我的同事们对我提出严正的批评。不管我的动机是怎样，因为我坚持辞职，在一年中，即使是在京的时候，也不过问院务，忍令法学院招致工作上的损失，是我的不可宽宥的错误。
    从我对于北京大学的校务的处理中，我也充分表现了旧知识分子的不良的思想和作风。在今夏以前，校务委员会是负责领导校务的，而我是常务委员之一。我不是一阵热，便是一阵冷；不是急躁，便是消极。我暴露了典型的小资产阶级出身的知识分子的弱点。我不联系群众，我不坚持真理，以致对校务的稳步改进没有起应起的作用。
    在这里，也应当指出，比我负有更大的责任的是前校务委员会主席汤用彤先生。汤先生向来是明哲保身的，与人不争的，对疑难之事也轻易不表示可否的。在他的领导之下，北京大学长期存在着的自由散漫基本上是没有被纠正的。汤先生自任副校长以来，作风已有些改善，但也还不够。我如果一向真正能对人民负责，我早应当面或公开地批评他，指出他的缺点，要求他加强领导，使得校务的改进可以多些快些。但是为了面子，为了顾虑私人情感，在此以前，我从没有这样做过。这也说明了我是怎样一个旧的知识分子。
    北京大学的自由散漫蔡元培先生是要负一部责任的，而将他在北京大学的主要教育思想——所谓“思想自由”和“学术自由”——长期地保留在北京大学之中的老一辈的教师们，包括我自己在内，则应负更大的责任。人民的思想和学术是应当自由的。但是，在蔡先生长校的时候，思想自由的具体表现是“兼容并包”，更具体的表现则是资产阶级的思想占有统治的地位。在新民主主义的国家的大学中，如果有人企图以当年占着统治地位的资产阶级的思想来和工人阶级的思想分庭抗礼，是不是可以的呢？我想是不可以的。至于“学术自由”，不但一开始就和实际脱离，以后更演变为院系各自为政，以及学术与政治对立，技术与政治对立，为学术而学术等种种严重的而且至今还没有肃清的错误思想。
    北京大学毕业的人们和在北京大学工作多年的人们容易为北京大学的光荣传统所迷惑。应当问，除了“五四”以外，北京大学的光荣传统究竟在那里？是的，在一二·九、一二·一和一九四六年底的反抗美军暴行运动中，以及在其他由中国共产党所领导的学生运动中，我们北京大学的同学都是站在战线的前列的。但是，其他一些学校的同学难道不是同样站在前列的么？即以“五四”而说，它诚然是在北京大学首先发动的，北京大学领导或参加的师生也特别多，但要承继“五四”的光荣传统，我们教师们首先应当分清“五四”运动的革命思想和“五四”右翼分子的反动思想。我们除了宣布胡适的思想为敌人的思想外，还应该好好地批判蔡元培的思想和这思想所遗留在我们中间的影响。
    从上面所指出的我在解放后在北京大学的工作中所已发现的缺点中，已经可以充分看出我的旧作风是怎样严重地存在着，也可以充分说明我的自由主义、个人主义的旧思想是怎样在作祟。当然，这些缺点只是存在着的缺点中的一部分。更深刻的自我检讨和别人的批评将会揭发更多的更严重的缺点。我要不顾面子不断地作自我检讨，不但检讨我在北京大学工作中的缺点，更进而检讨我在解放以前所犯过的严重错误。我应当欢迎别人对我提出无情的尖锐的批评。我并希望能够同样地批评别人。我深信相互批评就是相互帮助，也就是改造思想的唯一有效的方法。
    为了求自己的进步，为了改革高等教育，更为了对得起人民，对得起毛主席，让我们高等学校的教师们以最热烈的情绪卷入以批评自我批评方法进行自我教育和自我改造的运动的高潮吧！
