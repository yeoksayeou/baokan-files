Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 16th. The spokesperson of the Korean People's Army Headquarters issued a statement today as follows: The so-called statement issued on the 14th by Hanley, the Chief of the Court-Martial of the US Eighth Army, regarding the massacre of prisoners by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, is a despicable and shameless fabrication from beginning to end, with the purpose of creating new excuses for delaying the Korean armistice negotiations. The facts are diametrically opposed to the statement Hanley was instructed to make. The Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army have always treated prisoners leniently in accordance with humanitarian principles. Therefore, even under extremely difficult material conditions, they still provide the enemy officers and soldiers who have laid down their arms with the greatest possible care. This fact has been confirmed not only by all the prisoners released or not yet released by our army, but also by many reports from the US and British news agencies. Precisely because they are afraid of the dissemination of this truth, the United Nations Command Headquarters has prohibited news reporters from visiting the prisoners released by our side. Obviously, if the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers really massacred prisoners, why has the US invading army headquarters prohibited news reporters from visiting the released prisoners since February of this year? The reason they issued the ban is because the released prisoners, based on their own experiences, have repeatedly exposed the lies fabricated all along by the United Nations Command Headquarters regarding our side massacring prisoners.

Conversely, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers possess conclusive evidence of various kinds to prove that it is precisely the US "United Nations Forces" that have inhumanly massacred tens of thousands of prisoners who fell into their hands. As for the towering crimes of the American army in Korea of massacring women, children, and the elderly, and systematically destroying Korean cities, villages, industries, crops, houses, schools, hospitals, churches, and all cultural facilities, that is even more well-known throughout the world. The American generals' acts of massacre are not only inflicted upon our army officers, soldiers, and civilians captured by them, but also upon their own officers and soldiers captured by our army. For example, a prisoner camp located somewhere in northern Korea has been bombed five times by the US Air Force from February to October of this year, resulting in a total of sixty-two prisoners killed and wounded. The 1,362 American, British and other prisoners in this prisoner camp jointly issued a protest letter in October of this year, protesting against the brutal atrocities of the US Air Force. All of these will be forever recorded in history, and the American generals can never escape responsibility for all their beastly crimes.

Why did the American generals instruct Hanley to suddenly issue the lie of our army "massacring prisoners of war and civilians" at this time? What ulterior motives do they want to achieve? Their purpose is, first, to create a new excuse to refuse to reach an agreement on the issue of the armistice military demarcation line in order to establish the basic conditions for the armistice, that is, to indefinitely delay the armistice negotiations. Because the United Nations Command's armistice negotiation delegation recently used the excuse that issues such as the exchange of prisoners of war have not yet been agreed upon to refuse to establish a concrete agreement on the issue of the armistice military demarcation line. Second, it is to take this opportunity to stir up new war mania in the United States and the imperialist world in order to counter the growing anti-war movement of the people of the world, including the American and British people and soldiers, who are demanding the realization of an armistice in Korea and the reduction of armaments. Third, it is to cover up the towering crimes of the American generals themselves in Korea of massacring prisoners of war and civilians, and to preemptively create excuses for continuing to adopt obstructionist and delaying tactics when discussing the next items on the armistice agenda, including the issue of exchanging prisoners of war. Because only by delaying the Korean armistice negotiations and continuing the war of aggression against Korea can the people of the United States, Britain, and other countries continue to be forcibly conscripted to Korea to serve as cannon fodder, allowing their blood to flow into rivers, continue to maintain international tension, and continue to step up arms expansion and war preparations, so that those big millionaires on Wall Street can continue to obtain huge war profit income. Of course, under this shameful policy of delay, the American and British prisoners of war who could have hoped to return home by Christmas will not be able to return home as they hoped. Hanley's lies are the predetermined plan of the US government decision-makers. Precisely because of this, Van Fleet and Ridgway Headquarters pretended not to know about this in advance after Hanley's statement was issued, but Truman, the US congressmen, and the US bourgeois press immediately shouted and clamored like a swarm of bees. We want to ask these gentlemen: You say that we massacred prisoners, do you have any factual basis? Since you don't have any, and you will never have any factual basis, then who can you possibly deceive? Know that the people of the whole world, including your soldiers and their families, will surely see through your despicable lies.

### 朝鲜人民军总部发言人  关于美方捏造中朝人民部队屠杀俘虏的卑鄙谎言的谈话

　　朝鲜人民军总部发言人
    关于美方捏造中朝人民部队
    屠杀俘虏的卑鄙谎言的谈话
    【新华社平壤十六日电】朝鲜人民军总部发言人本日发表谈话如下：美国第八军军法处处长汉莱十四日发表的所谓朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军杀害俘虏的声明，从头至尾都是卑鄙无耻的捏造，其目的在于为拖延朝鲜停战谈判制造新的口实。事实是和汉莱被授意发表的声明水火不相容的。中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军一向根据人道精神宽待俘虏，所以虽在物质条件极端困难的环境下，仍然给予已经放下武器的敌军官兵以最大可能的各种照顾。这种事实不但为我军已释放或尚未释放的所有俘虏所证实，而且也为美英新闻通讯社的许多报道所证实，正因为害怕这个事实真相的传布，联合国军总部才禁止新闻记者访问被我方释放的俘虏。很明显，如果朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军真的杀害俘虏的话，美国侵略军总部为什么自今年二月起要禁止新闻记者去访问被释放的俘虏呢？他们所以要下禁止令，就是因为被释放的俘虏根据他们自己的经历，一再地揭穿了联合国军总部所一向捏造的所谓我方杀害俘虏的谎言。
    相反，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军方面握有确凿无疑的各种证据，来证明正是美方“联合国军”丧尽人性地杀害了成千成万的落在他们手中的俘虏。至于美国军队在朝鲜屠杀妇女、小孩、老年和有计划地毁灭朝鲜的城市、村庄、工业、农作物、民房、学校、医院、教堂以及一切文化设施的滔天暴行，那就更是举世周知的了。美国将军们的屠杀暴行不但施之于被他们俘虏的我军官兵和平民，而且也施之于被我军俘虏的他们自己的官兵。例如位在朝鲜北部某地的一个俘虏营，自今年二月到十月间就先后被美国空军轰炸五次，被炸死炸伤的俘虏共达六十二人。这个俘虏营的一千三百六十二名美英等国俘虏，曾在今年十月间联名发表了一个抗议书，抗议美国空军的残忍暴行。所有这些，都将永远记载在历史上，美国将军们决不能逃脱他们这一切兽性罪行的责任。
    美国将军们为什么要授意汉莱在这个时候突然发表所谓我军“残杀战俘与平民”的谎言呢？他们要想达到什么不可告人的目的呢？他们的目的，第一就是要制造一个拒绝就停战军事分界线问题达成协议以建立停战的基本条件，也就是把停战谈判无限期地拖延下去的新藉口。因为联合国军停战谈判代表团最近正是藉口交换战俘等问题尚未获得协议，而拒绝就停战军事分界线问题成立具体协议的。第二就是要借此在美国国内及帝国主义世界掀起新的战争狂，以便对抗世界人民包括美英人民和士兵在内要求实现朝鲜停战及裁减军备的日益发展的反战运动。第三就是要掩饰美国将军们自己在朝鲜所犯下的屠杀俘虏和平民的滔天罪行，并为在讨论停战议程的下一些项目包括交换战俘问题在内时继续采取阻挠和拖延战术预先制造藉口。因为只有拖延朝鲜停战谈判，继续进行侵朝战争，才可继续强制征调美英等国人民来到朝鲜充当炮灰，使他们血流成河，继续保持国际间的紧张空气，并继续加紧扩军备战，华尔街那些大富翁才能继续取得巨大的战争利润收入。当然，在这种可耻的拖延政策之下，本来可以希望在圣诞节回家的美英等国俘虏，就不可能按照他们的希望回家了。汉莱的撒谎是美国政府决策人们的预定计划。正因为这样，所以范佛里特和李奇微总部在汉莱的声明发表后，都假装预先不知道这回事，但是杜鲁门、美国议员们、美国资产阶级报界，却立刻就像一窝蜂一样大叫大嚷起来了。我们要问问这些先生们：你们说我们杀害了俘虏，你们有任何事实根据么？你们既然没有，而且永远也不会有任何事实根据，那么你们究竟能够欺骗得了谁呢？要知道，全世界的人民，包括你们的士兵和他们的家属在内，是一定会识破你们的这个卑鄙谎言的。
