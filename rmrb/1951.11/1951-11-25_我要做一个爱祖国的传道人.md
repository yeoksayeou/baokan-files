I Want to Be a Patriot Preacher
Wang Weifan, Huangnigang Church, Nanjing

　　Among the "spiritual" brothers and sisters, I was one of those most deeply poisoned by imperialism. After I came to Nanjing, I was constantly influenced by the imperialist ideological toxins of Yang Shaotang and Xu Chaozhen, two imperialist running dogs. Therefore, I have always been skeptical of the People's Government, and I did not understand the government's religious policy, mistakenly believing that the government was trying to suppress Christianity. I am also a passive and otherworldly person. In the two years since liberation, I have been unwilling to make progress and unwilling to participate in any patriotic movements. I didn't even sign the declaration banning atomic bombs. At that time, I felt that a person who pursues spirituality should not belong to this world and should not care about worldly affairs.

　　When Gu Renen was arrested in Qingdao, several counter-revolutionaries were also arrested in the Nanjing church. At that time, I thought this was the beginning of the government openly persecuting Christianity, and I even prepared to be arrested myself. But later, after seeing the accusations against Gu Renen in the newspaper, and after talks with government leaders and earnest conversations with brothers and sisters, I felt that the arrest of these people was a political issue, that they were imperialist running dogs. From that moment on, my distrust of the government began to change, but I still did not have a clear understanding of the use of the church by imperialism to carry out counter-revolutionary activities.

　　It was not until Xu Chaozhen was accused that I began to realize that imperialist elements were using the so-called "spiritual" churches to carry out counter-revolutionary activities and endanger the interests of the people. From that time on, my thinking began to change somewhat, especially the three-day city-wide accusation meeting, which helped me to change my thinking. I felt that since Christians live in this society, how can they not seek progress? At this time, I was still worried about church study, fearing that doing so would affect "spirituality." Later, with the help of various parties, I realized that only by completely severing the ties between the church and imperialism and eliminating ideological toxins can the church be reborn. Otherwise, it will head for destruction. What is there to talk about spirituality or unspirituality!

　　The "spirituality" touted by imperialists is false "spirituality." The "spirituality," "otherworldliness," and "not belonging to this world" spread by imperialists are merely a kind of anesthesia for the oppressed and the invaded, a set of conspiracies for counter-revolution and sabotage of the revolution. Therefore, on the one hand, we must actively use patriotic actions to shatter this conspiracy; on the other hand, we need to work hard to further improve ourselves.

　　In the past, imperialism used my simple heart of a martyr who loves the Lord, attempting to turn me into a reactionary tool who would wholeheartedly harm the people to the end. Therefore, the more I pursued, the more I was used by imperialism, and the more harm I caused to the motherland and the people. Now that I am awakened, I cannot but hate the insidious and viciousness of imperialism. Today, I want to use the spirit of a martyr to fight against imperialism and to love my motherland.

    我要做一个爱祖国的传道人
    基督教南京市黄泥岗教会  汪维藩
    在“属灵派”的弟兄姊妹中间，我自己受帝国主义毒害是比较深的一个。我到南京后，两三年来又经常受到帝国主义走狗杨绍唐、徐超尘的一套帝国主义的思想毒素影响。所以，我对人民政府一直是怀疑的，对政府的宗教政策不了解，误认为政府是要压迫基督教的。我又是一个消极超世的人。解放两年来，我不愿意进步，不愿意参加任何爱国运动，连禁用原子弹的宣言上我也没有签名，那时我觉得一个追求属灵的人，是应当不属这一个世界，不管世界上的事的。
    当顾仁恩在青岛被捕的时候，在南京教会里也有几个反革命分子被逮捕起来。当时，我以为这是政府公开逼迫基督教的开始，甚至自己还预备被捕，但后来看见报纸上对顾仁恩的控诉，又经过政府首长的谈话和兄弟姊妹们恳切的交谈，使我感到这一些人的被捕是政治问题，是帝国主义的走狗。从这一个时候起，我对政府不信任的态度才开始有了转变，但对帝国主义利用教会来进行反革命活动，还是认识不清的。
    当徐超尘被控诉以后，我才开始认识到帝国主义分子利用所谓“属灵派”的教会进行反革命活动，危害人民的利益。从那时候起，我的思想开始有些变化，特别是全市三天的控诉会，帮助了我的思想转变，觉得基督徒既然生活在这一个社会当中，怎么能够不求进步呢？这时对教会学习还存在着顾虑，怕这样搞会影响“属灵”。后来经过各方面的帮助，认识到只有彻底割断教会与帝国主义的联系，肃清思想毒素，才能带来教会的新生，不然就会走向灭亡，还谈得到什么属灵不属灵呢！
    帝国主义者所标榜的“属灵”，是假“属灵”，帝国主义者所传播的“属灵”、“超世”、“不属世俗”，只是对被压迫者和被侵略者的一种麻醉，是反革命和破坏革命的一套阴谋。所以，我们一方面要积极地以爱国行动，来粉碎这一个阴谋；另方面，我们需要努力进一步提高自己。
        过去，帝国主义利用我一颗单纯爱主的殉道者的心，企图将我造成一个死心塌地危害人民到底的反动工具，所以我愈追求，就愈被帝国主义利用，就愈造成对祖国对人民的危害；现在我觉悟了，我不能不痛恨帝国主义的阴险毒辣。今天，我要用一个殉道者的精神，向帝国主义斗争，来热爱我的祖国。
