Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 31st: Xinhua News Agency Special Correspondent reports: In order to eliminate any possible excuse for the U.S. side to delay the armistice negotiations, to quickly reach an agreement on the issue of the military demarcation line, and to ensure the smooth realization of the Korean armistice and peace, which is sincerely desired by all peace-loving people in the world, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation proposed a new plan for the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone at the small group meeting of the armistice negotiations this morning, which basically involves a ceasefire in place. This proposal suggests that, except for some necessary and reasonable adjustments in a few areas, both sides' troops should withdraw two kilometers from the current line of contact, and the areas withdrawn from by both sides should be used as a demilitarized zone.

    This proposal was presented to the U.S. side by our representative, General Li Sang-jo.

    The northern boundary of the demilitarized zone proposed by our side starts from about fifteen kilometers southeast of Goseong on the east coast, goes west through five kilometers north of Mundeung-ri, ten kilometers south of Geumseong, about four kilometers northwest of Gimhwa, about ten kilometers northwest of Cheorwon, about twelve kilometers northeast of Saneung, turns southwest, passes about one kilometer west of Panmunjom, and ends at the Imjin River estuary twenty kilometers southeast of Kaesong. The southern boundary is four kilometers south of the northern boundary.

    General Li Sang-jo pointed out when presenting this new plan: This plan represents the greatest possible effort made by the Korean-Chinese delegation to resolve the second agenda item. First, this plan fully complies with the principles of fairness and reason, because the adjustments suggested in this plan make the area from which both sides' troops withdraw almost exactly equal. Second, this plan fully conforms to military reality, because, apart from a few necessary adjustments, the demilitarized zone suggested in this plan strictly follows the existing line of contact between the two sides' forces. Third, this plan is practical, because it is based on the actual terrain on the battlefield and makes necessary and reasonable adjustments to the existing line of contact between the two sides.

    General Li solemnly pointed out that anyone who respects facts and sincerely wants to see a Korean armistice cannot make any conceivable criticism of this plan. He requested that the U.S. side carefully consider and fully accept this plan so that the armistice negotiations could enter into the discussion of other agenda items.

    Since the armistice negotiations resumed on October 25th, and the small group meetings to discuss the second agenda item have been successively reconvened, our representative proposed a military demarcation line plan on October 26th that was based on the existing battle line and made comprehensive adjustments to the entire battlefield. This plan respected the existing battle line and took into account the overall situation of the battlefield, and the proposed adjustments treated both sides completely equally. However, the U.S. representative has been insisting on its unfair and unreasonable plan proposed on October 25th, which starts from the existing line of contact and unilaterally demands that our side withdraw from 1,500 square kilometers, vainly attempting to obtain the Kaesong area without any effort. They opposed our side's fair and reasonable plan proposed on October 26th, resulting in no progress being made in the six days of small group meetings.

    Our side is now putting forward this new plan for the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone in order to remove any excuse for the U.S. side to obstruct the agreement on the second agenda item. As our representative pointed out, this plan is the greatest effort made by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the issue of the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone. In fact, there is no other possible plan besides this one. This is a decisive test of whether the U.S. side is willing to adopt a reasonable attitude to make the Korean armistice negotiations successful.

### 为解除美方拖延停战谈判任何可能的藉口  我方提出新的军事分界线与非军事区的方案

    为解除美方拖延停战谈判任何可能的藉口
    我方提出新的军事分界线与非军事区的方案
    【新华社开城三十一日电】新华社特派记者报道：朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团为了解除美方拖延停战谈判任何可能的藉口，迅速达成对军事分界线问题的协议，使全世界一切爱好和平的人民所衷心愿望的朝鲜停战与和平得以排除一切障碍而顺利实现，今日上午在停战谈判的小组会上，提出了基本上以就地停战为内容的新的军事分界线，与非军事区的方案。此项方案提议，除在少数地区进行若干必要的与合理的调整以外，双方部队从现行接触线各后撤二公里，以双方撤出的地区，作为非军事区。
    这一方案系由我方代表李相朝将军向美方代表提出。
    我方提议的非军事区的北缘，自东海岸高城东南约十五公里处起，西经文登里以北五公里，金城南约十公里，金化北偏西约四公里，铁原西北约十公里，朔宁东北约十二公里，转向西南经板门店西约一公里到开城东南二十公里的临津江口。其南缘则在北缘以南之四公里处。
    李相朝将军在提出这一新方案时，指出：这一方案乃是朝中代表团为了解决第二项议程所作的最大可能的努力：第一，这一方案完全符合公平合理的原则，因为这一方案所建议的调整，使双方部队撤出的地区面积几乎完全相等。第二，这个方案完全符合于军事实际，因为除了少数的必要调整以外，这个方案所建议的非军事区，严格地遵照了现有的双方部队的接触线。第三，这个方案是切实可行的。因为它是根据战场上的实际地形，对于现有双方部队接触线，作了必要与合理的调整。
    李将军郑重指出，任何一个尊重事实并诚心愿意看到朝鲜停战的人，都不可能对这个方案加以任何可以设想的指摘。他要求美方代表慎重考虑，并全部接受这个方案，以便停战谈判得进入其他几项议程的讨论。
    自从停战谈判在十月二十五日恢复，讨论第二项议程的小组会相继复会后，我方代表就于十月二十六日对停战问题提出了以现有战线为基础，对整个战场加以全面调整的军事分界线方案。这个方案既尊重了现有战线，又照顾了战场全局，其所提议的调整，对双方又都是完全平等对待的。但美方代表却一直坚持其十月二十五日提出的从现有的接触线出发，片面地要求我方退出一千五百平方公里，妄想垂手而得开城地区的不公平、不合理的方案，反对我方在十月二十六日提出的公平合理的方案，以致进行了六天的小组会未能获致任何进展。
    我方现在为解除美方阻挠第二项议程得以达成协议的任何藉口，提出了这个新的军事分界线和非军事区的方案。诚如我方代表所指出的，这个方案是朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军对军事分界线与非军事区问题所作的最大的努力。事实上除掉这个方案已经再没有任何其他可能的方案了。这是对美方究竟愿否采取合理态度使朝鲜停战谈判成功的一个决定性的考验。
