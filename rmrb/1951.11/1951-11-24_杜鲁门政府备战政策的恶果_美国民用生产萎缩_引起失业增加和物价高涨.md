Xinhua News Agency, November 21st dispatch from New York: The Truman administration's war economy policy has led to the shrinkage of US civilian production and further deterioration of people's lives.

　　According to the US government's military-first production plan, the supply of metals needed for US civilian production will be further reduced. The American magazine *Time* recently reported that from January 1, 1952, the supply of steel to civilian industries will be reduced by another 11.5 percent, copper by another 23 percent, and aluminum by another 17 percent.

　　The production of American civilian goods has long been in a general decline. According to the October issue of *Fortune* magazine, "Defense-related items are increasing, while durable consumer goods are decreasing. Not only are televisions, furniture, and cotton fabrics decreasing, but also shoes, carpets, clothing, alcohol, wood, coal, and other items."

　　The extent of the decline in civilian goods production can be seen from *The New York Times*' report on the crisis in the American rayon textile industry. The paper said in its financial section on November 4: "In the past three months, rayon production has decreased by 50 percent. Many factories are only operating three or four days a week, while some smaller factories have completely shut down."

　　Due to the reduction of important raw materials, civilian production will be further reduced. According to *Time* magazine, as a result of this measure, the production of American automobiles will be reduced by 42 percent.

　　The reduction in civilian production has already caused a large number of workers to lose their jobs. Even according to official US statistics, in August, the number of workers employed in non-durable goods manufacturing was lower than in the same period last year. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics explained this phenomenon in its report, saying: "This mainly reflects the decrease in the number of people employed in the textile and apparel industries in recent years. In these industries, a decrease in consumer demand and a continuous increase in inventory have been reported since the beginning of spring." The number of workers employed in the textile and apparel industries decreased by 77,000 and 59,000 respectively compared to a year ago. There are also many other civilian industrial sectors where the number of workers employed has decreased compared to a year ago, for example: workers in the automobile and household machinery industries decreased by 10 percent, the food industry decreased by 69,000, the leather industry decreased by 24,000, and the furniture industry decreased by 25,000.

　　With the continued reduction in civilian production, unemployment is bound to increase further. According to American newspaper reports, the reduction in civilian production by the "General Motors," "Ford," and "Studebaker" automobile companies alone will result in the unemployment of more than 70,000 workers.

　　The reduction in civilian production has led to new price increases, further deteriorating the situation of workers. For example, even according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' figures, in August alone, egg prices rose by 7 percent, pork by more than 4 percent, potatoes by 9 percent, and green beans by 27 percent. Furthermore, according to *The New York Times*, American workers lost 22.2 billion US dollars due to the "legal" price increases in the United States from January to September 1951, that is, price increases permitted by the so-called "price control" agencies.

　　According to official US statistics, the current consumption of bread by American workers has decreased by 12 percent compared to 1946, the consumption of sugar has decreased by 34 percent, and the consumption of meat, butter, and milk has all decreased by 8 percent.

### 杜鲁门政府备战政策的恶果  美国民用生产萎缩  引起失业增加和物价高涨

　　杜鲁门政府备战政策的恶果        
    美国民用生产萎缩     
    引起失业增加和物价高涨
    【新华社二十一日讯】纽约消息：杜鲁门政府的战争经济政策使美国民用生产萎缩、人民生活进一步恶化。
    按照美国政府军事第一的生产计划，美国民用生产所需的金属供应将进一步削减。美国《时代》杂志新近报道，从一九五二年一月一日起，对民用工业的钢的供应量将再减少百分之十一点五，铜将再减少百分之二十三，铝将再减少百分之十七。
    美国民用品的生产早已在普遍地衰落中。据十月号的《幸福》杂志报道，“国防方面的东西不断增多，耐久的消费品则在减少。不仅电视、家具和棉织品减少了，就是鞋子、地毯、衣服、酒类、木材、煤和其他物品也减少了。”
    民用品生产衰落的程度可以从《纽约时报》关于美国人造丝纺织业的危机的报道中看出。该报在十一月四日金融版中说：“在过去三个月中，人造丝的生产已减少了百分之五十。许多工厂每星期只开工三四天，而有些较小的工厂则完全停了工。”
    由于重要原料的削减，民用生产将更加缩减。据《时代》杂志说，由于采取了这个措施，美国汽车的生产量将减少百分之四十二。
    民用生产的缩减已使大批工人失业。即使根据美国官方的统计，在八月份，非耐用品制造业雇佣工人的数目已较去年同期为低。美国劳工统计局在它的报告中解释这个现象说：“这主要反映了年来纺织业和被服业雇佣人数的减少，在这些工业中，从开春以来就报道着消费需求的降低和存货的不断增加。”纺织和被服两业雇佣工人的数目较一年前分别减少七万七千和五万九千人。工人就业数目较一年前降低的还有许多其他民用工业部门，例如：汽车及家用机器业工人减少百分之十，食品工业减少六万九千人，皮革业减少二万四千人，家具业减少二万五千人。
    在民用生产继续缩减的情形下，失业势将进一步增加。据美国报纸消息，单单由于“通用”、“福特”和“斯蒂倍克”三大汽车公司减少民用生产的结果，就要又有七万多名工人失业。
    民用生产的减少引起了新的物价上涨，使劳动者的处境进一步恶化。例如，甚至根据劳工统计局的数字，在八月一个月中，鸡蛋价格就上升了百分之七，猪肉上涨百分之四强，马铃薯上涨百分之九，绿豆上涨百分之二十七。又据《纽约时报》报道，单是由于一九五一年一月至九月美国物价的“合法”的、即经过所谓“物价管制”机构允许的上涨，美国劳动者就损失了二百二十亿美元。
    根据美国官方的统计材料，目前，美国劳动者的面包消费量已比一九四六年减少了百分之十二，糖的消费量减少了百分之三十四，肉、牛油和牛奶的消费量都减少了百分之八。
