    Jinhua Textile Factory Workers Jia Tengyun and Yan Anzhen
    Improve Sizing Paste Composition, Reduce Costs
    Saving Nearly 120,000 Jin of Millet Annually

    Comrade Editor: Jia Tengyun and Yan Anzhen, workers in the sizing workshop of the Jinhua Textile Factory in Yuci, Shanxi, enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy by improving the composition of the sizing paste. In the past, they adhered to the old methods for preparing the sizing paste and never thought about making improvements. This year, after the factory underwent democratic reforms and established a patriotic pact, their attitude changed greatly. They tried their best to reduce the cost of sizing, so as to increase the nation's wealth. In October, after two weeks of experimentation, they finally replaced sizing paste with castor oil. The yarn produced with this new sizing method is exactly the same as before, and it can save more than 119,000 jin of millet annually.

    晋华纺织厂工人贾腾云阎安祯
    改进浆纱配浆成分降低成本
    全年可节省近十二万斤小米
    编辑同志：山西榆次晋华纺织厂浆纱间工人贾腾云和阎安祯热烈响应毛主席增产节约的号召，改进了浆纱配浆成分。过去，他们老守着配浆料的老办法，从没想到要改进。今年，厂里经过民主改革，订了爱国公约，他们的态度大变了，尽量设法使浆纱成本降低，好增加国家财富。十月份，经过两星期的实验，终于把用浆纱膏改用了蓖麻油，这新的配浆法，浆出的纱和过去是完全一样的，全年可以节省小米十一万九千多斤。　段承业
