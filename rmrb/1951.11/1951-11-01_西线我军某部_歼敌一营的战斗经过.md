Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, October 31st: Our front-line reporter reported on the battle in which a unit of our army on the western front completely annihilated an enemy battalion in the Yujishanli area, 6 kilometers southeast of Shuning: On the morning of October 24th, an enemy battalion of the 5th Regiment of the 1st Cavalry Division of the U.S. invading army had just advanced to a small hilltop east of Yujishanli when it was immediately bombarded by our army's fierce artillery fire, suffering a number of casualties. As a result, they were forced to postpone their attack on the position guarded by a platoon of our army until noon. During the attack, the enemy army was subjected to heavy casualties from our army's intense firepower, and five consecutive charges failed. When the remaining enemy troops launched their sixth charge, they unexpectedly did not encounter any fire resistance. They cautiously advanced to the position only to discover that the entire platoon of our army had already actively withdrawn. Therefore, the enemy hurriedly built fortifications, wanting to consolidate this position that they had gained at the cost of heavy casualties. On the evening of that day, our army launched a strong counterattack. The artillery shells fired by our army fell like raindrops on the enemy's artillery positions, almost preventing the enemy's artillery from retaliating. Then, our infantry troops launched a heroic attack, successively capturing four small hilltops, and penetrating into the enemy's central position, engaging in fierce close combat with the enemy on the dark-covered barren ridge. After a night of fighting, except for a few enemies who escaped the net, the remaining enemies were completely annihilated. The battle results have been verified as follows: The entire 3rd Company of the enemy's 1st Battalion and the majority of the 1st and 2nd Companies were annihilated, totaling 430 enemy soldiers killed and 6 enemy soldiers captured. In addition, many rocket launchers, machine guns, carbines and other weapons were seized.

    歼敌一营的战斗经过
    【新华社朝鲜前线三十一日电】本社前线记者报道西线我军某部在朔宁东南六公里鱼积山里地区歼敌一个营的战斗经过称：十月二十四日晨，美国侵略军骑兵第一师第五团的一个营刚进到鱼积山里以东一个小山头，就立即遭到我军炮火的猛烈轰击，死伤了一批人，因而，被迫推迟到中午才向我军某部一个排守卫的阵地发起进攻。敌军在进攻中，又遭到我军炽烈火力的大量杀伤，连续五次的冲锋都失败了。当残余敌军发起第六次冲锋时，却出乎意料地没有受到任何火力的还击，他们小心翼翼地进到那个阵地，才发觉我军一个排已经全部主动撤走了。于是敌军急忙加筑工事，想巩固这一块用大批伤亡换来的阵地。就在这天黄昏，我军发起了强烈的反击，我军发射的炮弹像雨点般地落向敌军的炮兵阵地，几乎使敌军的炮兵不敢还手。接着，我军步兵部队就发起英勇的进攻，连续夺得四座小山头，插入敌军中心阵地，在黑暗笼罩着的荒岭上，与敌人进行激烈的近战。经过一夜的冲杀，除了少数敌人漏网外，其余敌人悉被歼灭。战果经查明如下：歼灭该敌第一营第三连全部和第一连、第二连的大部，共击毙敌军四百三十名，俘掳敌军六名。另外，并缴获许多火箭筒、机关枪、卡宾枪等武器。
