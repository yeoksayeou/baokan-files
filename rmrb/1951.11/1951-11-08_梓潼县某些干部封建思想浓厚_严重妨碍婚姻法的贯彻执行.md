    Certain Cadres in Zitong County Have Strong Feudal Ideas, Seriously Hindering the Implementation of the Marriage Law

    To the Editors: Some cadres in Zitong County, Western Sichuan, harbor strong feudal ideas and incorrect understandings, and are indifferent to the implementation of the Marriage Law. Some cadres fear that promoting the Marriage Law will cause "chaos in the world." For example, district cadre Yang Kaida promoted the Marriage Law once in Qingyan Village and, seeing that seven or eight women filed for divorce, dared not promote it again. Some cadres even regard products of the feudal marriage system such as "male superiority over female," "parents' orders and matchmakers' words," "husbands' rights," and "family rules" as inviolable principles. For example, district cadre Guo Liangxi said: "The Marriage Law elevates women too much. 'Equality between men and women' means men are just slaves to women. It's best to have the old-fashioned marriage of 'parents' orders and matchmakers' words,' which saves trouble with constant divorces."

    Based on the various erroneous views of the cadres, the implementation of the Marriage Law is greatly hindered, and the struggle of young men and women for freedom of marriage does not receive the support and guarantee it deserves. Events that violate human rights and openly and unreasonably prevent and interfere with the freedom of marriage of men and women continue to occur in rural areas. For example, Dai Sihe, a middle peasant in Lianhe Village, Fuxing Township, has consistently abused his wife, Shi Guoxiu, in the past. A month ago, he kicked Shi Guoxiu's stomach fiercely over a trivial matter, causing a miscarriage, and the mother also died. The village has not yet dealt with this criminal who abused and killed a woman. Ma Xingxiu (female) was often beaten by her husband and in-laws after marrying Dai Siyi, and was forced to live with pigs and cattle in a pigsty. Her body was often covered with bruises all year round. Not long ago, Dai Siyi even crippled one of her arms. Feeling that she could not continue living like this, she requested a divorce four times from the chairman of the village peasant association and the village head, but was refused each time. Ma Xingxiu recently went to the township people's government to request a divorce, but township head Shen Yancong said: "Although it is liberated now, women still need to adhere to the three obediences and four virtues, be filial to their parents, and serve their husbands," and refused to forward her request to the higher-level government.

    Unreasonable phenomena such as arranged marriages with buying and selling, the practice of taking child brides, and illegally preventing women from participating in social activities still exist in rural areas.

    I believe that the local leading organs should pay serious attention to the above situation, educate the cadres about the Marriage Law, and give legal sanctions to those involved in cases of injury and death caused by marriage issues.

### 梓潼县某些干部封建思想浓厚  严重妨碍婚姻法的贯彻执行

    梓潼县某些干部封建思想浓厚
    严重妨碍婚姻法的贯彻执行
    编辑同志：川西梓潼县有些干部有着浓厚的封建思想和错误认识，对贯彻执行婚姻法漠不关心。有的干部怕宣传婚姻法会引起“天下大乱”。如区干部杨开达在青岩村宣传了一次婚姻法，看到有七、八个妇女提出离婚，以后就再也不敢宣传了。有的干部甚至把“男尊女卑”、“父母之命、媒妁之言”、“夫权”、“家规”等封建婚姻制度下的产物，看作是天经地义。如区干部郭亮熙说：“婚姻法把妇女抬得过高了，‘男女平等’就只有男子给女人当牛，最好还是过去那种‘父母之命、媒妁之言’的旧式婚姻好，省得时常闹离婚。”
    基于干部种种错误观点，因而大大妨碍了婚姻法的贯彻执行，青年男女争取婚姻自由的斗争得不到应有的支持和保障。乡村里还继续发生侵犯人权，公然无理阻止、干涉男女婚姻自由的事件。如复兴乡联合村中农戴思和，过去一贯虐待妻子石国秀，一个月以前，因一件小事猛踢石国秀的肚子，把胎儿踢下后，母亲也死去。对于这种虐杀妇女的罪犯，该村至今仍未处理。马兴秀（女）与戴思宜结婚后，常常遭受丈夫公婆的打骂，并逼她在一个猪圈里与猪牛同宿。一年四季身上常有青一块紫一块的伤疤。不久以前戴思宜竟将她的一只手臂打成了残废。她感到不能过下去了，曾向村农会主席、村长请求离婚四次，但都遭到拒绝。马兴秀最近到乡人民政府请求离婚，乡长沈延聪说：“现在虽然是解放了，妇女还是要三从四德，孝顺双亲，侍奉丈夫”，不予转报上级政府。
    农村中买卖包办婚姻、收童养媳、非法制止妇女参加社会活动等不合理现象也仍存在。
    我认为当地领导机关应对上述情况引起严重注意，对干部进行关于婚姻法的教育，对因婚姻问题酿成的伤亡事件，应给有关人员以法律制裁。
