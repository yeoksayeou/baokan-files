Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 19th (TASS dispatch): All French newspapers were suspended today. On November 19, all newspaper workers in France responded to the call of the Printing Workers' Union Federation and began a general strike. This union federation, which represents more than 98 percent of the country's printing workers, is affiliated with the General Confederation of Labour (CGT). This strike is in response to the strike that began in mid-October by printing workers in Marseille. The Marseille printing workers went on strike because they were subjected to strong suppression by the Marseille police authorities, who forcibly occupied the printing plant of "Marseillaise" newspaper, attempting to obstruct the publication of this democratic newspaper. To counter these police atrocities, the union federation called for a general strike to protest the police persecution of "Marseillaise."

Approximately 12,000 French printing workers are participating in the strike. The striking workers are firmly demanding that the police immediately withdraw from the printing plant of "Marseillaise."

    抗议反动政府迫害“马赛人报”
    法国印刷工人举行总罢工
    【新华社讯】塔斯社巴黎十九日电：今天法国报纸全部停刊。十一月十九日，法国全体报纸工人响应印刷工会联合会的号召，开始总罢工。这个工会联合会拥有全国百分之九十八以上的印刷工人，它是属于总工会的。这次罢工是响应马赛印刷工人在十月中旬即已开始的罢工。马赛印刷工人是因为遭受马赛警察当局的强力镇压而罢工的，当时警察强占了“马赛人报”的印刷厂厂房，想阻挠这个民主报纸的印行。为了对付这些警察暴行，工会联合会号召总罢工以抗议警察对“马赛人报”的迫害。
    约有一万二千个法国印刷工人实行罢工，罢工工人坚决要求警察立即撤离“马赛人报”的印刷厂厂房。
