Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 29th -- A unit of the People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet has recently garrisoned Gyantse, an important town in Rear Tibet.  Dzongpon Longe Langpa, dispatched to Gyantse by the Tibetan local government, and more than 30 headmen under his command, went to the suburbs in advance to welcome the PLA. Dzongpon Longe Langpa presented a Hada to the commander of the unit. When the PLA entered the city, more than 2,000 residents of the city, farmers from various places, and lamas lined the streets for more than half a kilometer to welcome them. Groups of Tibetan people joyfully crowded around huge portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, as well as dozens of five-star national flags, welcoming the troops into the Gyantse urban area.
