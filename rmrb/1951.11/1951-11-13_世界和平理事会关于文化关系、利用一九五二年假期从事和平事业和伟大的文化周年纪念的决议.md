Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 10th: The Second Session of the World Peace Council adopted the following resolutions on cultural relations, using the 1952 holiday for peace, and great cultural anniversaries on the 7th:

　　The Second World Peace Congress pointed out in its ninth letter to the United Nations that strengthening cultural relations between countries can promote understanding between them.

　　The World Peace Council has consistently paid attention to all sincere efforts in this regard. It has itself initiated such activities many times and has achieved positive results.

　　The World Peace Council does not intend to replace various organizations, movements, and societies engaged in this activity, but it is always ready to do its best to promote their activities.

　　The World Peace Council has established an International Committee on Cultural Relations, which was announced by the World Peace Council's resolution of February 26, 1951; this committee performs the tasks of guidance and liaison entrusted to it.

　　The World Peace Council requests this committee to formulate the basic principles of simple and easy procedures that can truly promote cultural exchange between countries, and to notify organizations in various countries of these principles.

　　The World Peace Council also requests the National Peace Committees that have not yet done so to establish special committees on cultural relations.

　　In this way, each country will be able to formulate, study in detail, and carefully prepare plans that stipulate all the conditions that enable cultural exchange to proceed smoothly.

　　In order to achieve genuine results favorable to culture and peace, the maintenance of cultural relations should be based on the principle of reciprocity, but to achieve this, every contact must arouse the concern of the general public, or of one or several aspects of the cultural community.

　　The World Peace Council has decided to immediately launch two major events in 1952: using holidays for peace service and holding celebrations for the great cultural anniversaries.

　　National Peace Committees can use holidays for peace service to develop cultural exchanges on a large scale.

　　Regarding the celebration of the great cultural anniversaries, the World Peace Council has adopted several suggestions, recommending that countries hold the 150th anniversary of Hugo's birth (proposed by Mao Dun), the 500th anniversary of the birth of Vinci (according to the Italian famous painter and sculptor, proposed by Ehrenburg), the 100th anniversary of Gogol's death (proposed by Donini), and the 1000th anniversary of the death of Avicenna (according to the famous Arab doctor, jointly proposed by doctors from many countries).

　　With these measures, the National Peace Committees will be able to make all cultural figures and the broadest sections of the people concerned about the development of culture as the common wealth of all mankind.

　　In its resolution of February 26, 1951, the World Peace Council emphasized its hope to convene international conferences of cultural leaders from various countries by profession.

　　The World Peace Council is satisfied that this proposal has been realized, and interesting measures are gradually being implemented among doctors, scientists, writers, artists, architects, urban designers, educators, and film workers.

　　The World Peace Council believes that this measure is of great significance for strengthening cultural relations and will receive the support of all those who wish for the friendship of all countries.

　　In terms of cultural exchange, the World Peace Council has decided to hold various exhibitions in the capitals of some countries in 1952: the International Folk Art Exhibition, the Construction Documentation Exhibition, and the Children's Book and Children's Painting Exhibition.

　　Finally, the World Peace Council requests the National Peace Committees to promote the exchange of book catalogs and literary and scientific publications.

    关于文化关系、利用一九五二年假期从事和平事业和伟大的文化周年纪念的决议
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社维也纳十日讯：世界和平理事会第二届会议在七日通过关于文化关系、利用一九五二年假期从事和平事业和伟大的文化周年纪念的决议如下：
    第二届世界和平大会曾在致联合国书的第九项中指出，加强各国间的文化关系，可以促进它们之间的了解。
    世界和平理事会一贯注意在这一方面的一切诚恳的努力。它本身也曾多次发起这种活动，并已取得积极的成果。
    世界和平理事会并不打算代替各种从事这方面活动的组织、运动和社团，但它经常准备尽力促进它们的活动。
    世界和平理事会设立了国际文化关系委员会，这是世界和平理事会一九五一年二月二十六日的决议已经宣布过的；这个委员会执行着委托给它的指导和连络的任务。
    世界和平理事会请这个委员会制订可以真正促进各国文化交流的简单易行的程序的基本原则，并将这些原则通知各国的组织。
    世界和平理事会并请求还没有这样做的各国和平委员会成立文化关系特别委员会。
    这样，每一个国家都能够拟订、详细研究和慎重准备一些计划，规定使文化交流得以顺利进行的一切条件。
    为了取得有利于文化与和平的真正的成果，文化关系的维持应以互相来往为原则，但是要做到这一点，必须使得每一次接触，都可以引起广大舆论界、或者文化界的一方面或若干方面的关心。
    世界和平理事会已决定立即发起在一九五二年办两件大事：利用假期为和平服务，对伟大的文化周年纪念举行庆祝。
    各国和平委员会利用假期为和平服务，就能够大规模发展文化交流。
    关于庆祝伟大的文化周年纪念，世界和平理事会通过了若干建议，建议各国举行雨果诞生一百五十周年纪念（茅盾提议）、芬奇（按系意大利著名画家、雕刻家）诞生五百周年纪念（爱伦堡提议）、果戈理逝世一百周年纪念（多尼尼提议）以及阿维森纳（按系阿拉伯著名医生）逝世一千周年纪念（许多国家的医生共同提议）。
    有了这些措施，各国和平委员会就能够使得一切文化界人士和最广大阶层的人民关心作为全人类共同财富的文化的发展。
    世界和平理事会在一九五一年二月二十六日的决议中，曾着重指出，希望能按专业分别邀集各国文化界领袖举行国际会议。
    世界和平理事会感到满意，因为这个主张已经实现，在医生、科学家、作家、艺术家、建筑家、城市设计家、教育家和电影工作者中间，有兴味的措施正在逐渐实现。
    世界和平理事会相信，这种措施对于加强文化关系有重大的意义，并将获得所有愿意各国和好的人们的支持。
    在文化交流方面，世界和平理事会已决定于一九五二年在某些国家的首都举办各种展览会：国际民间艺术展览会、建设文献展览会、儿童书籍和儿童绘画展览会。
    最后，世界和平理事会请求各国和平委员会促进图书目录、文学和科学出版物的交换。
