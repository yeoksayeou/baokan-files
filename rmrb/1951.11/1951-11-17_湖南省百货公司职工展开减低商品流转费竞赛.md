　　Hunan Provincial Department Store Employees
    Launch Competition to Reduce Commodity Circulation Costs
    The Hunan Provincial Branch of the China Department Store Company has educated its employees by inspecting waste in its operations and launched a patriotic labor emulation movement to reduce commodity circulation costs. The company conducted a patriotic labor emulation movement in July of this year, which led to some improvements in the company's management. Therefore, in early October, the company's trade union called on employees and the administration to sign a collective contract to prepare for a labor emulation movement to reduce commodity circulation costs. However, some employees said at the time, "We have nothing more to save." "Now it feels very tight to get things from the general affairs section, and further savings will affect our work." Some people emphasized the difficulties of saving, saying, "It is very difficult to reduce commodity losses without sufficient warehouses and complete furniture and equipment." Therefore, the movement could not be launched.
    In response to this situation, the trade union, in cooperation with the Chinese Communist Party branch, the Communist Youth League branch, and the administration, conducted ideological education for employees on patriotism and the importance of saving commodity circulation costs. It also assisted the company's quota work department in inspecting waste in operations, using facts to show employees that saving is necessary and possible. When inspecting the implementation of the previous labor emulation plan, individual guarantees, and linked contracts, it was found that there were still many wasteful phenomena in the work. For example, the company's commodity transportation had many shortcomings such as blind allocation and piecemeal delivery. If these could be improved in the future, it is estimated that transportation costs for all commodities could be saved by more than 170 million yuan in November and December alone. For example, in the past, when loading and unloading sugar, bags were often scattered, resulting in significant losses. If iron hooks were avoided when loading and unloading sugar bags, and trampling and heavy pressure were avoided, sugar transportation losses in November and December could be reduced by 46 million yuan. For example, in terms of office electricity consumption, if relevant personnel could concentrate in one place to prepare tables, reconcile accounts, and count goods after business hours, electricity consumption of 513 kilowatt-hours, worth more than 1.4 million yuan, could be saved in November and December alone. In the last competition, the storage section guaranteed "to complete the warehousing procedures within three days after the goods enter the warehouse." However, in reality, the procedures for some goods were not completed even twenty days after they entered the warehouse, which affected commodity allocation, accounting, reporting, and liquidation of the retail department, wasting a lot of manpower and time.
    After exposing these wasteful situations in the work through inspection, most employees realized the necessity and possibility of launching a labor emulation to reduce commodity circulation costs. Subsequently, according to the requirements of the competition plan formulated by the trade union, 630 of the company's 700 employees revised their individual guarantees and re-signed 197 linked contracts. According to the labor emulation plan, it is estimated that more than 220 million yuan can be saved in commodity circulation costs in November and December alone in the company's transportation, loading and unloading, storage, losses, interest, management, and business aspects of all commodities. At the same time, the trade union also called on employees to actively promote commodities, especially slow-moving goods. At the end of October, the company's trade union and the administration signed a collective contract for November and December to reduce commodity circulation costs and expand sales. In the contract, the administration made appropriate guarantees in terms of systems and employee welfare. The trade union made guarantees to complete the various targets required by the contract in launching the labor emulation movement, and the employees of each section and department also made guarantees according to the provisions of the contract.
    After carrying out the above series of work, reducing commodity circulation costs has become a mass movement. For example, the employees of the company's first retail department now concentrate on reconciling accounts and counting goods every night, paying attention to saving electricity and time. Wang Pingzhou, an apprentice in the warehouse of the first retail department, has changed his past free and undisciplined style and actively helps others to move goods and reconcile accounts to shorten the time of commodity in and out of the warehouse. Many employees have nearly completed or overfulfilled their individual plans for promoting slow-moving goods and accelerating capital turnover within eight days. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 湖南省百货公司职工展开减低商品流转费竞赛

　　湖南省百货公司职工
    展开减低商品流转费竞赛
    中国百货公司湖南省分公司以检查工作中的浪费情况教育职工，开展了减低商品流转费用的爱国主义劳动竞赛运动。该公司在今年七月间曾开展了一次爱国主义劳动竞赛运动，对公司的经营管理方面有了一些改进。因此十月初旬该公司工会号召职工和行政方面签订集体合同，准备开展减低商品流转费用的劳动竞赛运动。但是，当时就有的职工说：“我们没有什么可以再节约了。”“现在到总务股领东西就感到很紧，再节约会影响工作。”有些人强调节约的困难说：“没有足够的仓库，家具设备又不全，要减少商品损耗难得很。”因而运动开展不起来。
    根据这种情况，工会就在中国共产党支部、青年团支部和行政方面的配合下，对职工进行了爱国主义和重视节约商品流转费用的思想教育，并协助公司定额工作部门检查了工作中的浪费情况，用事实向职工说明节约是必须而且可能的。在检查了上次劳动竞赛计划、个人保证和联系合同的执行情况时，发现工作中还有很多浪费现象。例如：该公司调运商品中存在着不少盲目调拨、零星输送等缺点，如果今后能够加以改善，预计仅十一、十二两月，全部商品运费就可以节省一亿七千多万元。又如，过去装卸食糖时，常常散包，损耗很大；如在装卸糖时避免用铁钩钩糖包和践踏、重压，十一、十二两月的食糖运输损耗就能够减少四千六百万元。又如办公用电方面，如果晚上停止营业后有关工作人员能集中一处制表、对账、点货，仅十一、十二两月就将节省电力五百一十三度，价值一百四十多万元。上次竞赛中，保管股保证“货物入库后，三天办好入库手续”，但是，实际上有些货物入库二十天，手续还未办好，因而影响了商品调拨、会计划账、报表以及门市部的清算等，浪费了很多人力和时间。
    经过检查揭露了工作中的这些浪费情况以后，绝大部分职工才认识到开展减低商品流转费用的劳动竞赛的必要和可能。接着，根据工会制定的竞赛计划的要求，该公司七百多职工中有六百三十人修改了个人保证，重订了一百九十七个联系合同。根据劳动竞赛计划，仅十一、十二两月，在公司全部商品的运输、装卸搬运、保管、损耗、利息、管理、业务等方面，就可节省商品流转费二亿二千多万元。同时，工会并号召职工积极推销商品，特别是冷背货。十月底，该公司工会和行政方面又签订了十一、十二月份减低商品流转费用和扩大推销业务的集体合同。在合同中，行政方面在制度上和职工福利上作了适当保证；工会方面作了完成合同中关于开展劳动竞赛运动所要求达到的各项目标的保证，各科、各部职工也根据合同的规定分别作了保证。
    进行了上述一系列的工作以后，减低商品流转费用已成为群众性运动。例如，该公司第一门市部职工目前每晚集中对账、点货，注意到电力和时间的节约。第一门市部仓库练习生王平宙已一变过去的自由散漫作风，主动帮助别人搬货、对账，以缩短商品出、入库时间。不少职工在八天内就将近完成或超额完成了两个月的推销冷货、加速资金周转的个人计划。（新华社）
