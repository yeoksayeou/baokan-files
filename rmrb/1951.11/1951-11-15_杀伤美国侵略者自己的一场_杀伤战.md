    A "War of Attrition" That Killed the American Aggressors Themselves

    On the left bank of the Imjin River is a nameless hill. From October 5th to 11th, twenty-two brave warriors of a certain company of the Chinese People's Volunteers fought a battalion of the U.S. Army's 1st Cavalry Division on this small hill for seven days, killing and wounding more than 350 enemies, while suffering only three minor injuries.

    This nameless hill tightly controls the left side of the Lianchuan-Wonsan Highway. The twenty-two warriors guarding the hill had built solid fortifications on the position and conducted daily position drills. On the eve of the battle, the Communist Party members among the twenty-two warriors held a Party meeting. The Party members unanimously vowed: "If the enemy dares to attack, we will definitely turn this small hill into a heroic mountain for killing the enemy!"

    On October 5th, the enemy shelled for a whole day, covering their tanks and infantry as they advanced. At night, the enemy advanced to the foot of the hill and built fortifications, and the sounds of chopping trees and shoveling earth clearly transmitted to the hill. The warriors patrolled the position all night. They excitedly greeted each other: "The first blow must give the enemy a good surprise!"

    The next morning, as the sun just rose, helmeted heads popped up one by one on the hillside. More than fifty enemies climbed to a small hill, and began constructing fortifications there with clanging noises. This small hill was the target for the warriors' pre-battle shooting drills. As soon as platoon leader Zhao Hengzhi gave the order, cannons and machine guns roared simultaneously. Soon, the soldiers excitedly ran to the platoon leader to report the good news: "Hit! Look, the enemy is carrying corpses down the hill!"

    The enemy's attack was originally intended to be step by step, but after being severely beaten this time, they became impatient. On the 7th, the enemy dispatched four aircraft and seven tanks, cooperating with two infantry companies to attack the hill. Seeing the enemy infantry densely and chaotically packed like locusts, Zhao Hengzhi told the soldiers to prepare hand grenades. When the enemy's tanks approached about fifty meters from the front of the position, enemy planes dropped gasoline bombs as usual, and all the enemy's guns and artillery on the ground fired wildly as usual. The warriors calmly squatted in the fortifications. According to the American-style attack method, the enemy infantry followed closely behind the artillery fire and surged into the barbed wire, launching an assault on the hill. At this time, hand grenades and submachine gun bullets suddenly and fiercely resounded in the enemy ranks from the hill. Those American soldiers immediately turned around, desperately dragging their wounded soldiers and rolling straight down the hill.

    That day, the battle lasted for six hours. The enemy left behind nearly a hundred corpses and retreated in embarrassment.

    After the fierce battle, the warriors immediately began repairing the fortifications tirelessly. It was not until midnight, when the overturned fortifications were all repaired firmly, that everyone went to eat. Zhao Hengzhi stayed alone in the fortifications to monitor the enemy. He recalled the victory of the day's battle, and considered the tactics for dealing with the enemy's tanks tomorrow. Later, he asked the company headquarters for rocket launchers, and carefully made arrangements, determining the area for destroying the enemy's tanks.

    On the morning of the 8th, two enemy tanks indeed drove onto the fog-filled position. Zhao Hengzhi and anti-tank shooter Tian Baimi immediately entered the camouflaged anti-tank fortifications. When the tanks approached, Zhao Hengzhi pointed to the front tank and said to Tian Baimi: "Aim and fire in the direction I'm pointing!" The rocket was launched immediately. Before the enemy in the tanks had time to discover their position, they had already fired the second rocket from another location. Instantly, the first tank burst into flames, while the second tank was still moving. Then, Tian Baimi fired two more rockets, and the second tank was also destroyed in response.

    The enemy's offensive had been going on for four days. Every evening, the enemy busily carried away the corpses piled up on the mountain and at the foot of the mountain as usual. But our twenty-two warriors were all safe and sound.

    The most intense battle began at more than two o'clock in the afternoon on October 11th. Crowded together, the enemies surged up the mountain from three sides, regardless of squads or platoons. Zhao Hengzhi threw out a large grenade with one hand and shouted, "Comrades, hit them hard!" The sound of submachine gun fire and hand grenade explosions immediately resounded as one. In the instant when the enemies rushed into the barbed wire, the warriors threw hand grenades, two at a time, into the enemy ranks, throwing out more than four hundred hand grenades in total, scattering the enemy's flesh and blood. Many enemies who were not killed by the explosions were stunned on the ground. The warriors' submachine guns were then aimed at these unconscious enemies and fired fiercely. Enemy officers carrying pistols and supervising the battle from behind could not escape the punishment of death either.

    On the evening of October 11th, American military trucks, fully loaded with corpses, retreated.

    The twenty-two brave warriors of the People's Volunteers fought fiercely with a battalion of the U.S. Army's main force, the 1st Cavalry Division, for seven days, killing and wounding more than 350 enemies at the cost of only three minor injuries. The warriors mocked: Ridgway and Van Fleet are always boasting about a "war of attrition," this is truly a "war of attrition" that killed the American aggressors themselves!

    杀伤美国侵略者自己的一场“杀伤战”
    新华社记者　阎吾
    临津江左岸有一座无名的小山。从十月五日到十一日，中国人民志愿军某连的二十二个勇士，曾在这座小山上和美军骑兵第一师一个营作战七天，毙伤敌人三百五十多名，自己仅轻伤三名。
    这座无名小山紧扼着涟（川）元（山）公路的左侧。守备该山的二十二个勇士曾在这阵地上修筑了坚固的工事，并日夜进行阵地练兵。战斗前夕，二十二个勇士中的共产党员举行了一次党的会议。党员们一致立誓：“要是敌人敢来进攻，我们一定把这座小山变成一座杀敌的英雄山！”
    十月五日，敌人打了一整天炮，掩护战车和步兵向前进攻。夜间，敌人进抵山下修筑工事，砍树和铲土的声音清晰地传到山上。勇士们彻夜巡逻阵地。他们兴奋地互相打着招呼：“第一下一定要给敌人一个下马威！”
    第二天早晨，太阳刚刚升起，戴着钢盔的人头便一个个在山腰上冒了出来。五十多个敌人爬到一个小山包上，就在那里叮叮当当地修工事。这个小山包正是勇士们在战前演习射击的目标。排长赵恒志命令一下，炮和机关枪就同时吼叫起来。不一会，战士们都兴冲冲地跑到排长面前报喜：“打中了，你看敌人在往山下抬死尸啦！”
    敌人的进攻原是采取步步为营的办法，但遭到这次痛打后就沉不住气了。七日，敌人调来四架飞机和七辆战车，配合两个步兵连向山上进攻。赵恒志看到敌人步兵像蝗虫般地密集而杂乱，就告诉战士们准备好手榴弹。当敌人的战车开到阵地前沿约五十公尺时，敌机照例投下了汽油弹，地面上敌人所有的枪炮也照例胡乱地发射起来。勇士们都沉着地蹲在工事里。按照美国式的攻击方式，敌人步兵就紧跟在炮火后面拥进了鹿砦，向山上发起冲锋。这时，山上的手榴弹和冲锋枪子弹突然猛烈地在敌群中响起来。那些美国大兵一下就回过头去，没命地拖着伤兵向山下直滚。
    这一天，就这样打了六个钟头。敌人丢下近百具尸体，狼狈地败退回去。
    激战过后，勇士们立即不顾疲劳地动手抢修工事。一直到半夜，把打翻了的工事都修结实了，大家才去吃饭。赵恒志一个人留在工事里监视敌人。他回忆着白天作战的胜利，又考虑到明天如何对付敌人战车的计策。后来，他向连部要了火箭筒，又仔细作了布置，确定下击毁敌人战车的地带。
    八日早晨，在大雾弥漫的阵地上，敌人果然开来了两辆战车。赵恒志和反战车射手田白密马上进入伪装的反战车工事。等到战车接近到跟前时，赵恒志手指着前面的一辆，对田白密说：“照我手指的方向，瞄准打！”火箭弹随即打了出去。战车上的敌人还没有来得及发现他们的阵地，他们已在另一个地方发出了第二发火箭弹。立刻，第一辆战车烧起了大火，第二辆战车还在移动。接着，田白密又打出两发火箭弹，第二辆战车也应声被击毁了。
    敌人的进攻已经进行了四天。每天傍晚，敌人照例忙忙碌碌地搬运着堆满在山上山下的死尸。但我们的二十二个勇士，却个个安然无恙。
    最激烈的一次战斗是在十月十一日下午两点多钟开始的。拥挤成一团的敌人不分班、排地从三面涌上山来。赵恒志一手扔出一个大手雷，喊了一声：“同志们，猛打！”冲锋枪的射击声和手榴弹的爆炸声立刻响成一片。当敌人冲进鹿砦后的刹那间，勇士们把手榴弹两个一起地向敌群中扔去，一共扔出了四百多个手榴弹，打得敌人血肉横飞。不少没有被炸死的敌人，都被震昏在地上。勇士们的冲锋枪又对准这些昏倒的敌人猛扫。提着手枪在后面督战的敌军军官们也逃不了死亡的惩罚。
    十月十一日晚上，美国军用卡车满装着尸体退走了。
    人民志愿军二十二个勇士和美军主力骑一师一个营的兵力激战七天，仅以轻伤三名的代价杀伤敌人三百五十多名。勇士们嘲笑说：李奇微、范佛里特老是吹嘘“杀伤战”，这才真是一场杀伤美国侵略者自己的“杀伤战”呢！
