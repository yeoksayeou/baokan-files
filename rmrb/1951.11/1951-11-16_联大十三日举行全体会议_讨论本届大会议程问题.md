Xinhua News Agency, Paris, November 14th: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary meeting on the 13th to discuss the General Committee's recommendations regarding the agenda of the current session.

The Soviet delegation's proposal "On Measures to Eliminate the Threat of Another World War and Consolidate International Peace and Friendship" was included in the agenda without discussion.

Under the manipulation of the United States, the majority of the General Assembly adopted the General Committee's recommendation, passed based on a proposal by the Thai representative, to reject the inclusion of the Soviet delegation's proposal to discuss the issue of China's representation in the United Nations on the agenda of the current session. Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky spoke, pointing out that the General Committee's recommendation aimed to conceal the act of infringing upon the sovereignty of the great Chinese people. It completely violated the basic principles of the United Nations General Assembly, the United Nations Charter, and the interests of peace. Moreover, this recommendation bound the will of the General Assembly in advance, restricting the right of national delegations to freely express their opinions, thus undermining the rules of procedure of the United Nations. The Soviet delegation lodged a solemn protest against this unprecedented situation. The Burmese representative also opposed the General Committee's recommendation, which sought to force the United Nations to forget the existence of the People's Republic of China and the great Chinese people. He pointed out that there now exists a Chinese People's Government that genuinely represents the Chinese people and is trusted by them. It is impossible to disregard this genuine fact. If the General Assembly refuses to discuss the issue of China's representation, it will be detrimental to the existence of the United Nations. Representatives from Poland and Czechoslovakia also spoke, condemning the General Committee's recommendation as violating the fundamental basis of the United Nations, violating the principles of the Charter, and as a serious insult to the great Chinese people. To defend the General Committee's recommendation, U.S. delegation leader Acheson delivered a brief speech. However, he could only repeat the old slanders against the Chinese people, nonsensically claiming that the Chinese people had participated in the war of aggression against Korea. Representatives from Britain, Australia, and the Philippines followed their American masters, slandering the Chinese people. Finally, when voting on the General Committee's recommendation, representatives from eleven countries voted against it, and four delegations abstained.

Like in the General Committee, the American-British majority in the General Assembly insisted on including the Kuomintang elements' slanderous case on the agenda of the General Assembly. This behavior of the American-British bloc was severely condemned by Soviet representative Malik. He emphasized that there are no differences between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, whether on the issue of China's political independence and territorial integrity or on the issue of maintaining and consolidating peace in the Far East. The Soviet government maintains the most friendly relations with China's only legitimate government, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. The actual threat to China's political independence and territorial integrity is the United States' aggressive actions. During the vote, the American-British bloc still passed the inclusion of the Kuomintang's slanderous case on the General Assembly's agenda with a majority of thirty votes. However, representatives from twenty-one countries refused to support the American-British action, including eight votes against and thirteen abstentions.

The American-British majority also disregarded the opposition of the Soviet Union and other countries' representatives and passed the proposal by the United States, Britain, and France regarding the establishment of a so-called international commission to go to Germany to investigate whether Germany possesses the conditions for holding free elections, and included it on the agenda. Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky spoke against including this proposal on the agenda because it directly contradicts the United Nations Charter, which stipulates that the United Nations shall not handle German issues. This proposal is so absurd that even the Israeli representative said that it is morally unacceptable and legally unfounded.

The Yugoslav Tito clique's slanderous case against the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries was also included on the General Assembly's agenda. Soviet representative Sobolev pointed out in his speech that the Tito clique's spreading rumors and slanders against the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries is an attempt to cover up their policy of turning Yugoslavia into a colony of U.S. imperialism and to deceive the Yugoslav people. The policies of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries pose no danger to Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav people. The real danger is the invasion of Yugoslavia by American monopoly capitalists and militarists, turning it into an American colony.

The General Committee's recommendation to postpone including the Arab countries' accusation against France for violating the principles of the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Morocco on the General Assembly's agenda was condemned by the Egyptian representative. The Egyptian representative pointed out that this recommendation violates the United Nations Charter. Soviet representative Yarujian spoke in support of the aforementioned proposal by the Arab countries and condemned the American-British-French bloc for refusing to submit this legitimate issue to the General Assembly while allowing some countries to use the General Assembly's platform to engage in slander. He emphasized that this situation in the United Nations is intolerable, and the General Assembly must not contribute to the further transformation of the United Nations from an international organization into an organization catering to the needs of American aggressors.

At the suggestion of Egypt, the General Assembly decided to postpone the discussion of this issue for a few days.

The General Assembly also passed the inclusion of some other proposals on the agenda, completing the discussion on agenda items.

　　联大十三日举行全体会议
    讨论本届大会议程问题
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十四日讯：联合国大会十三日举行全体会议，讨论总务委员会关于大会议程的建议。
    苏联代表团所提“关于消除另一次世界大战的威胁和巩固国际和平与友好的措施”的提案未经讨论即被列入议程。
    在美国操纵下，大会多数通过了总务委员会根据泰国代表提议通过的建议，拒绝把苏联代表团所提关于讨论中国在联合国代表权问题的提案列入本届大会议程。苏联代表团团长维辛斯基发言，指出总务委员会这个建议旨在掩饰侵犯伟大中国人民的主权的行为，它完全违反联合国大会的基本原则，违反联合国宪章，违反和平的利益。不仅如此，这个建议事先把大会的意志束缚起来，限制各国代表团自由表示其意见的权利，因此，就破坏了联合国的议事规则。苏联代表团对于这种史无前例的情况提出严正的抗议。缅甸代表也反对总务委员会这个想强使联合国忘记中华人民共和国和伟大的中国人民的存在的建议。他指出，现在已有真正代表中国人民并受他们信任的中国人民政府存在。不考虑这个真正的事实是不可能的。大会如果拒绝讨论中国代表权问题，就会有害于联合国的存在。波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的代表也发言谴责总务委员会的建议违反联合国的根本基础，违反宪章的原则，是对伟大的中国人民的严重侮辱。为了要替总务委员会的建议辩护，美国代表团团长艾奇逊发表了简短的演说。但是他只能重复老一套的对中国人民的诽谤，胡说什么中国人民参加了侵略朝鲜的战争。英国、澳大利亚和菲律宾的代表追随他们的美国主子之后，诽谤中国人民。最后，在表决总务委员会的建议时，有十一个国家的代表团投票反对，四个代表团弃权。
    大会的美英多数像在总务委员会内一样主张把国民党分子的诽谤案列入大会议程。美英集团的这种行为受到苏联代表马立克的痛斥。他着重指出：在苏联与中华人民共和国之间，不管是在中国的政治独立和领土完整的问题上，还是在维持并巩固远东和平的问题上，都是没有分歧的。苏联政府和中国唯一合法的政府——中华人民共和国中央人民政府保持着最友好的关系。对中国政治独立和领土完整的实际威胁是美国的侵略行动。在投票时，美英集团仍以三十票多数通过将国民党的诽谤案列入大会议程。但是有二十一个国家的代表团拒绝支持美英的行动，其中包括八票反对，十三票弃权。
    美英多数还不顾苏联及其他国家代表的反对，通过把美英法三国关于建立所谓国际委员会赴德国调查德国是否具备举行自由选举条件的提案列入议程。苏联代表团团长维辛斯基发言反对把这提案列入议程，因为它直接和联合国宪章相抵触，宪章规定联合国不得处理德国问题。这个提案是如此地荒谬，以至连以色列的代表也说这个提案在道义上是难以接受的，而在法律上又是没有根据的。
    南斯拉夫铁托集团的对苏联和人民民主国家的诽谤案也被列入大会议程。苏联代表索波列夫在发言中指出，铁托集团造谣污蔑苏联与人民民主国家，是想借此掩饰他们把南斯拉夫变为美帝国主义的殖民地的政策，欺骗南斯拉夫人民。苏联和人民民主国家的政策对南斯拉夫和南斯拉夫人民并没有任何危险。真正的危险倒是美国垄断资本家和军国主义者侵入南斯拉夫，把它变为美国的殖民地。
    总务委员会建议延缓把阿拉伯国家控诉法国在摩洛哥破坏联合国宪章与人权宣言原则的提案列入大会议程，这个建议遭到埃及代表的谴责。埃及代表指出这个建议违反联合国宪章。苏联代表亚鲁疆发言支持阿拉伯国家所提的上述提案，并斥责美英法集团拒绝把这个正当的问题提交大会，却容许有的国家利用大会讲台进行诽谤。他强调联合国中这种情况是不能容忍的，大会决不可助长联合国进一步由国际组织变成迎合美国侵略者所需要的组织。
    在埃及建议下，大会决定延缓几天再讨论这个问题。
    大会还通过把一些其他的议案列入议程，完成了关于议程问题的讨论。
