    Democratic League Central Standing Committee Holds Meeting
    Endorsing CPPCC National Committee Resolutions
    Defining Central Tasks as Resisting America, Aiding Korea, Increasing Production, Practicing Economy, and Remolding Ideology
    [By Our Newspaper] The Central Standing Committee of the China Democratic League held its 20th meeting on November 12th, passing a resolution on accepting the reports and all resolutions of the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and striving for their implementation. The full text is as follows:
    The Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference victoriously closed on November 1st. The instructions in Chairman Mao's opening speech, the work reports on politics, resisting America and aiding Korea, finance and economy, culture and education, and conference affairs by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice-Chairman Chen Shutong, Vice-Chairman Peng Zhen, Vice-Premier Chen Yun, and Vice-Premier Guo Moruo, as well as all resolutions of the conference, were unanimously endorsed and fully accepted by the 20th Central Standing Committee of the League. In particular, the three central tasks of continuing to strengthen the movement to resist America and aid Korea, advocating and promoting the patriotic movement to increase production and practice economy, and extensively launching the ideological remolding movement, and systematically organizing the study movement of Marxism-Leninism combined with the practice of the Chinese revolution of Mao Zedong Thought, are defined as the central tasks of the League. It was also decided to call on all League members to study the above documents, strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought combined with the practice of the Chinese revolution, and extensively carry out self-education and self-remolding movements using the method of criticism and self-criticism, which is a more urgent task. Therefore, based on the actual situation of the League, three specific regulations are made, calling on all League members to resolutely strive for their thorough realization:
    (1) We must continue to strengthen the movement to resist America and aid Korea. We must further mobilize every comrade and mobilize the masses to continue to expand the donation movement. Branches and sub-branches in various places should formulate donation plans and ensure their completion. We must effectively assist the government in doing a good job in preferential treatment work; thoroughly eliminate the hidden special agents and spies of imperialism in China; continue to develop and deepen the education of patriotism and internationalism. Every comrade should closely connect with the masses and regularly carry out current affairs propaganda among the masses; we must further popularize and deepen the patriotic pact movement and conduct regular inspections. This is a basic form for people of all strata to carry out common patriotic activities and patriotic education to improve organization and work efficiency, which must be promoted for a long time and continuously improved.
    (2) We must actively launch the movement to increase production and practice economy, and organize the masses to carry out savings. Each work unit should, under the principle of opposing waste, practicing strict economy, streamlining institutions, and improving efficiency, jointly formulate savings methods with all working comrades and insist on their implementation. Comrades participating in government work should especially spontaneously and creatively improve work efficiency to ensure the completion of administrative tasks. It is also necessary to promote and develop the enthusiasm of youth and women to participate in various inspection works to oppose waste and practice strict economy. Doing these tasks well will greatly help our country's economic construction and the struggle to resist America and aid Korea.
    (3) We must extensively launch the ideological remolding movement. All comrades must earnestly and systematically study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought combined with the practice of the Chinese revolution. We must establish Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as the League's guiding ideology within the League. Actively carry out criticism and self-criticism to correct various erroneous and even reactionary ideas among us. League organizations in various places should immediately establish Mao Zedong Thought study committees to lead League members in their studies. When studying Chairman Mao's works, we must connect with reality, connect with our own thoughts, and conduct introspection and criticism. Only in this way can we correctly understand the laws of social development, correctly understand the laws of the development of the Chinese revolution, and the glorious future of moving from new democracy to socialism and communism. Only in this way can we transform ourselves, improve ourselves, and better serve the people.

     【本报讯】中国民主同盟中央常务委员会于十一月十二日举行第二十次会议，通过关于接受中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议各项报告及全部决议并为其贯彻执行而奋斗的决议，全文如下：
    中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议业于十一月一日胜利闭会，毛主席开会词中的指示，周恩来总理、陈叔通副主席、彭真副主席、陈云副总理、郭沫若副总理关于政治、抗美援朝、财政经济、文化教育、会务各项工作报告，以及大会全部决议，经本盟第二十次中央常务委员会一致表决衷心拥护，完全接受；尤以继续加强抗美援朝运动，提倡和推动爱国增产节约运动，广泛开展思想改造运动，有系统地组织对于马克思、列宁主义与中国革命实践相结合的毛泽东思想的学习运动三项中心任务，定为本盟的中心任务。并决定号召全体盟员学习上述各项文件，加强学习马克思、列宁主义与中国革命实践相结合的毛泽东思想，以批评与自我批评的方法，广泛地开展自我教育和自我改造运动，更为急待进行的工作。因之，根据本盟实际情况作出三项具体规定，号召全体盟员坚决为其彻底实现而努力奋斗：
    （一）我们必须继续加强抗美援朝运动，要进一步动员每个同志，并发动群众，继续扩大捐献运动。各地支、分部要订出捐献计划，并保证其完成。我们要切实协助政府作好优抚工作；彻底肃清暗藏在中国的帝国主义的特务间谍分子；继续发展和深入爱国主义与国际主义的教育，每个同志要密切联系群众，经常地在群众中进行时事宣传；要进一步普及和深入爱国公约运动，按期检查，这是各阶层人民进行共同的爱国活动和爱国教育提高组织性和工作效率的一种基本形式，必须长期推行，不断改进。
    （二）我们必须积极展开增产节约运动，要有组织地发动群众进行节约。每个工作单位，要在反对浪费，厉行节约，精简机构，提高效率的原则下，由全体工作同志，共同规定节约办法，坚持实行。参加机关工作的同志，尤应自发地、创造地提高工作效率，保证行政任务的完成。更要推动和发扬青年和妇女的积极性，使参加各项反对浪费、厉行节约的检查工作。这些工作做好了，将大有助于我们国家的经济建设和抗美援朝的斗争。
    （三）我们必须广泛展开思想改造运动。全体同志要认真地、有系统地学习马克思、列宁主义与中国革命实践相结合的毛泽东思想。我们要在盟内树立马克思、列宁主义与毛泽东思想为盟的领导思想。积极开展批评与自我批评，用以纠正我们中间的各种错误的以至反动的思想。各地盟的组织应即成立毛泽东思想学习委员会，领导盟员进行学习，学习毛主席的著作时，必须联系实际，联系自己思想，进行反省与批评。只有这样，我们才能正确了解社会发展的规律，正确了解中国革命发展的规律及由新民主主义走向社会主义、共产主义的光辉前途。也只有这样，我们才能改造自己，提高自己，更好地为人民服务。
