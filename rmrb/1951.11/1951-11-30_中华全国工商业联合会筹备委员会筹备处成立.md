    Xinhua News Agency, 29th: The Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, in order to assist in the organization of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, designated Vice-Chairman Chen Shutong, Secretary-General Li Weihan, and Committee Member Zhang Naiqi to be responsible for inviting representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors across the country who attended and were present at the Third Session of the National Committee to conduct consultations. They held symposiums twice, on October 26th and November 2nd. After discussions, it was decided to establish the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce in three steps. The first step is to establish the Preparatory Office of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. The candidates for the Preparatory Office Committee were nominated after consultations among Chen Shutong, Li Weihan, Zhang Naiqi, and representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors in Beijing, as well as relevant authorities, and after seeking opinions from the heads of major administrative regions and relevant parties. Li Zhuchen and Le Songsheng (North China Region), Xiang Shuxiang and Miao Hainan (East China Region), Yu Jintang and Jiang Bingyan (Central South Region), Gong Tianmin and Chen Jisheng (Northeast Region), Wen Shaohe and Li Zhuo'an (Southwest Region), Jing Chunxian and Wei Qishan (Northwest Region), Xue Muqiao (Secretary-General of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council), Ye Jizhuang (Minister of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Trade), Nan Hanchen (President of the People's Bank of China), Chen Shutong, Zhang Naiqi, and Sha Qianli (Members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference) were selected to form the committee of eighteen members. The Preparatory Office has now been established, and Chen Shutong has been appointed as the Director of the Preparatory Office, and Sha Qianli as the Secretary-General of the Preparatory Office. The Preparatory Office is merely a working body and will be dissolved after the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce is established. The Preparatory Office expects to complete the preparations for convening a preparatory representative meeting and establishing the Preparatory Committee in about three months. The second step is to convene the Preparatory Representative Meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and organize the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. After the Preparatory Committee has made a certain period of preparatory work and completed all necessary preparations, it will proceed to the third step—convening the National Congress of Industry and Commerce Representatives to formally establish the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce.

    中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会筹备处成立
    【新华社二十九日讯】中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员会，为了协助组织全国工商业联合会，曾指定由陈叔通副主席、李维汉秘书长、章乃器委员三人负责邀请出席、列席全国委员会第三次会议的全国各地工商界代表进行协商，先后曾在十月二十六日、十一月二日两度举行座谈会。经过商谈，决定分三个步骤成立全国工商业联合会。第一步是成立中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会筹备处。筹备处委员人选经陈叔通、李维汉、章乃器和各地来京的工商界代表以及有关机关进行协商，并分别征取各大行政区行政首长和有关方面的意见后，推定李烛尘、乐松生（华北区），项叔翔、苗海南（华东区），余金堂、江炳炎（中南区），巩天民、陈季升（东北区），温少鹤、李琢庵（西南区），经春先、魏岐山（西北区），薛暮桥（中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会秘书长），叶季壮（中央人民政府贸易部部长），南汉宸（中国人民银行行长），陈叔通、章乃器、沙千里（中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会委员）等十八人组成。现在，筹备处业已成立，并推定陈叔通为筹备处主任，沙千里为筹备处秘书长。筹备处仅是工作机构，等到中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会成立后，就宣告结束。筹备处预计以三个月左右时间完成召开筹备代表会议，成立筹备委员会的准备工作。第二步是召开中华全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议，组织全国工商业联合会筹备委员会。筹备委员会再作一定时期的筹备工作，完成各项必要的准备后，就进行第三步工作——召开全国工商界代表会议，正式成立中华全国工商业联合会。
