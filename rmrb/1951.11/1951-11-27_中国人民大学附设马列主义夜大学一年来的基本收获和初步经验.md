    The Affiliated Marxist-Leninist Night University of the People’s University of China, since its establishment in September 1950, under the leadership of the Party Committee of the People’s University and with the direct assistance of Soviet experts, has basically completed its teaching tasks. Currently, the regular teaching for the second academic year has already begun. The more than four hundred students of the original Marxist-Leninist Night School have graduated and entered the first grade of the Night University, beginning the study of a new educational plan.

    According to statistics, among the three hundred and sixty-six students who participated in the Night University’s first academic year exams, excluding those who were absent due to leave and are awaiting make-up exams, three hundred and sixty-one students passed; five students failed one subject, accounting for 1.37% of the total number of examinees; one hundred and fifty-nine students achieved excellent results in all subjects; one hundred and twenty-nine students achieved good or excellent results; the overall average score was 4.6.

    Over the past year, the implementation of the planned teaching has resulted in teachers and cadres initially acquiring some basic theoretical knowledge of Marxism-Leninism systematically, thereby improving their political and ideological level. Many students felt that their past theoretical knowledge was "fragmented and incomplete," and that in the past year of study it has become more systematic; therefore, it has greatly helped to improve teaching and professional work.

    Over the past year, students have fundamentally overcome the past laissez-faire state of study and developed study habits, laying the foundation for future independent research due to regular theoretical study. In the process of learning, the students deeply realized that the improvement of the basic theory of Marxism-Leninism is the basic key to doing various scientific research and improving the level of political thought. Therefore, they regarded this kind of learning as an indispensable part of their daily political life. Not only were there few absences or truancies, but many people tried to squeeze out time for self-study; students from outside the school often took trains to attend classes on time.

    The result of the school absorbing more than 100 cadres from various agencies outside the school to participate in learning (excluding auditors) has promoted the cadre study in the respective agencies. Cadres sent by various agencies to study at the school have become the backbone of cadre study in their respective agencies, and many students have actually served as study instructors or theoretical teachers in their respective agencies. Through them, the advanced Soviet teaching experience adopted by the school and the content of certain courses in the night school have been spread to various agencies.

    Over the past year, the school's work has achieved certain results and gained some experience. These experiences are:

    First, for the theoretical education of cadres below the intermediate level, adopting an organized and planned regular teaching method has a great effect. Facts show that only in this way can the past scattered and laissez-faire state or handicraft-style learning methods of cadres be completely changed, so that they can systematically learn some preliminary theoretical knowledge. However, for a small number of cadres with a higher theoretical level, appropriate changes should be made in teaching methods and content. Of course, it is also necessary to pay attention to preventing laissez-faire attitudes. Generally speaking, it will be better to organize classes according to different levels and the principle of voluntariness.

    Second, in this kind of regular spare-time theoretical learning school for cadres, a clear and suitable educational plan must be formulated, and teachers of high quality must be available to guarantee the completion of the educational plan and the continuous improvement of teaching results. Cadres' political and theoretical study should and must start with basic theory. It should be noted here that we should take care of the learning ability of cadres, the categories should be small, and the weight should be light; at the beginning of each semester, a detailed progress schedule of each course should be printed and distributed to facilitate students to grasp. In the past year, the school has adopted three courses at the same time, and the teaching time is also long each time. Generally, it feels that the weight is heavier, and some "indigestion" phenomena inevitably occur; most students feel that time is tight and they cannot finish reading the reference books. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the number of categories taught at the same time (no more than two) and shorten the teaching time (no more than 150 minutes per night).

    Third, in terms of teaching methods, the advanced experience of systematic lectures and class-based "classroom discussions" is correct. According to the school's situation over the past year, this kind of learning is best to require basic problem solving in the classroom, so that self-study is easier; but it is also difficult to learn well if the necessary self-study is neglected. Therefore, after the lecture, it is necessary to conduct review and self-study. Not too many reference books should be specified, and freely participated in informal talks and individual tutoring should be organized appropriately. On this basis, "classroom discussions" are conducted. During "classroom discussions," both teachers and students must be fully prepared, the topics should not be too many, and they should be good at grasping key issues, conducting in-depth research, and adopting automatic speech and conversation between teachers and students, and less hard-and-fast questions and answers (although they have the role of urging reading), less simple mechanical repetition on handouts, and more emphasis on the analysis and research of practical problems. At the end of each problem discussion, the teacher should criticize various erroneous viewpoints and make a simple and clear conclusion. This kind of "classroom discussion" with a clear purpose and a certain degree of guidance will make learning more lively, more in-depth, and the effect will be greater.

    Fourth, to do a good job in this kind of learning, there must be four conditions: leadership support, organizational guarantee, adherence to the system, and cadre consciousness, otherwise it will easily fall into laissez-faire. At the beginning of the school's establishment, the president and the Party committee not only solved the problems of teachers and funds, but also successively issued decisions and instructions, stipulating the class time of the night university, and all units stopped work and meetings to let students come to class; and made a resolution to give cadres a certain amount of self-study time for in-depth research. In this way, the possibility of some people using work as an excuse to hinder learning was eliminated, and the cadre's demand for learning was supported. Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League organizations at all levels also frequently conducted inspections and supervision, especially the Party committee included the cadre's learning work on the agenda, frequently deployed, inspected, and supervised, which provided a strong guarantee for the student's enthusiasm for learning, the persistence of the learning attitude, and the correctness of the learning attitude. It should be particularly emphasized here that the establishment and adherence to the system plays a great role in learning. At the beginning of the night university, a set of leave, attendance, and performance evaluation systems were stipulated and insisted on implementing. According to the students' reactions, its role is very large. The academic year examination not only urged the students to conduct a general review and basically overcome some "indigestion" phenomena, but also solved some theoretical viewpoints and problems that were not clarified in peacetime; more importantly, it enhanced the students' confidence and enthusiasm and consolidated their ideological foundation from the examination. Performance assessment must focus on the usual learning status in order to constantly check the students' learning results and urge them to learn better, otherwise it will inevitably form a situation of relaxation in peacetime and temporary cramming, and the results will not be very solid. Finally, all the above conditions must also be based on the ideological consciousness of the cadres. Because although cadres require to improve themselves theoretically, problems will still occur due to deviations in understanding, for example, the contradiction between work and study often cannot be properly handled ideologically, only taking care of temporary work and ignoring the fundamental improvement. Some cadres also showed "inertia" in learning, so they will "not be able to get in," and the system will also become a mere formality for them. Therefore, constantly correcting the learning attitude and promoting ideological consciousness is one of the important conditions for whether everyone can learn well. Over the past year, many cadres have overcome various difficulties and achieved a regular attendance rate of more than 90%, which is due to the conscious learning mood as a guarantee.

    Over the past year, although the Night University has achieved some results and experience, its shortcomings are still many. It is now studying to make further improvements in certain aspects based on past lessons, and paying due attention to how to more closely combine theory and practice. Now, in addition to preparing to solve this problem in teaching work, it is also studying the content of education, and using Chairman Mao's "On Practice" as the main content of the philosophy course. After graduating from the Night University, a more advanced learning organization mainly studying Mao Zedong's works will be organized, so as to better enable cadres to use theory to guide their practice.

    中国人民大学附设马列主义夜大学一年来的基本收获和初步经验
    云　光
    中国人民大学附设马克思、列宁主义夜大学，自一九五○年九月成立以后，在人民大学党委会领导和苏联专家直接帮助之下，基本上完成了教学任务。目前，第二学年的正规教学已经开始。原马列主义夜校的四百多学员，已经毕业，并升入夜大学一年级，开始了新的教育计划的学习。
    夜大学第一学年考试结果，除因故请假未参加考试有待补考的以外，据统计，在已参加考试的三百六十六名学员中，及格人数为三百六十一名；有一门不及格者五名，占全体与考人数的百分之一·三七；各科均为优者一百五十九名；为优良者一百二十九名；总平均分数为四·六分。
    一年来，由于按照既订计划实施教学的结果，使得教员、干部初步系统地学得了一些马克思列宁主义的基本理论知识，从而提高了他们的政治思想水平。许多学员感到过去自己的理论知识是“零零碎碎，很不全面”，而在一年来的学习中已使之比较地系统化了；因此也就大大地帮助了教学业务工作的提高。
    一年来，学员们由于进行了正规的理论学习，便从根本上克服了过去学习上的自流状态，养成了学习习惯，打下了今后独立研究的基础。在学习过程中，学员们深刻地觉察到马列主义基本理论的提高是作好各种科学研究和提高政治思想水平的基本关键，因此他们就把这种学习当作了日常政治生活中不可缺少的内容。平时不但很少有人缺课、旷课，并有许多人设法挤出时间自习；校外学员则经常坐火车按时前来上课。
    本校吸收校外各机关百余干部参加学习（旁听生除外）的结果，推动了各该机关的干部学习。各机关派来本校学习的干部，已成为各该机关干部学习中的骨干分子，许多学员并已实际上充任了各该机关的学习指导员或理论教员。经过他们，把本校所采用的苏联的先进教学经验，把夜校某些课程的内容，传布到各个机关。
    一年来的本校工作获得了一定成绩，也获得了某些经验，这些经验是：
    第一，对中级以下干部的理论教育，采取有组织、有计划的正规的教学方式，效果是很大的。事实说明：只有如此，才能彻底改变过去干部学习中的涣散自流状态或手工业式的学习方法，使他们系统地学到一些初步理论知识。但对于少数理论水平较高的干部，在教学方法以及内容上，则应予适当改变，当然，注意防止自流也是必要的。一般来说，根据不同的程度与自愿的原则，分别编班学习，效果一定是会更好的。
    第二，在这种正规的干部业余理论学习的学校里面，必须订定明确的、适合需要的教育计划，并须有质量较高的教员，才可以保证教育计划的完成与教学效果的不断提高。干部政治理论学习，应该而且也必须从基本理论学起。这里要注意的是：应该照顾到干部学习的能力，门类要少，分量要轻；每学期开始，应将各课详细进度日程印发，使学员便于掌握。年来本校采取了三门课程同时并进，且每次授课时间又长，一般感到分量较重，不免发生某些“消化不良”的现象；多数学员，则感到时间紧迫，参考书看不完。因此，减少同时讲授的门类（最多两门），缩短授课时间（每晚不超过一百五十分钟）是必要的。
    第三，在教学方法上，系统的讲授和分班的“课堂讨论”的先进经验，是正确的。根据本校一年来的情况看，这种学习，最好要求在课堂上基本解决问题，这样自习就比较容易；但因此而忽视必需的自习，也是难以学好的。因此，讲授之后，一定要进行复习与自修。参考书不应指定太多，并应适当组织自由参加的漫谈与平时的个别辅导。在此基础之上，进行“课堂讨论”。“课堂讨论”时，教员和学员都必须有充分的准备，题目也不宜过多，并要善于抓紧重点问题，深入研究，多采取自动发言与教员同学员之间的谈话方式，少做硬性问答（虽然有其督促看书的作用），少做讲义上的单纯机械的重复，多着重实际问题的分析研究。每个问题讨论终结，教员应批判各种错误观点，并做出简单明确的结论。这种具有明确的目的性的、并带有一定辅导成份的重点的“课堂讨论”，就会使学习更活泼、更深入，效果也会更大。
    第四，要搞好这种学习，必须有领导方面的支持、组织保证、坚持制度和干部自觉四个条件，否则即易陷于自流。本校成立之初，校长、党委不单给解决了师资、经费诸问题，并连续颁发了决定、指示，规定了夜大学上课时间，任何单位一律停止工作和会议，让学员来上课；并做出决议，给干部以一定自修时间，以便深入研究。这样，就消灭了某些人借口工作妨害学习的可能性，支持了干部学习的要求。各级党、政、工、团组织，也经常进行检查督促，特别是党委把干部学习工作列入了议事日程，经常布置、检查、督促，这就为学员学习热情的持久、学习态度的端正，提供了有力的保证。这里特别应该强调指出的是制度的建立和坚持，对学习的作用是很大的。夜大学一开始便规定了一套请假、考勤和考绩制度，并予坚持贯彻。据学员的反应，其作用是很大的。学年考试，不特督促学员进行了总复习，基本上克服了某些“消化不良”的现象，从而也解决了一些平时未搞清的理论观点、问题；更重要的是从考试中增强了学员的信心与热情，巩固了他们的思想基础。成绩考核，必须着重于平时的学习状况，才能经常不断地检查学员的学习成绩，督促他们更好的学习，否则必然形成平时松懈，临时突击，成绩也将不甚巩固。最后，所有上述条件，也还必须建筑在干部思想自觉的基础之上。因为干部虽要求从理论上提高自己，但还会因认识上的偏差而发生问题，例如，工作与学习之间的矛盾，往往不能从思想上作适当处理，只顾一时工作，忽略从根本上的提高。也有一些干部表现了学习上的“惰性”，这样就会“钻不进去”，制度对他们也会成为具文。因此，经常端正学习态度、发扬思想自觉性，是每个人能否学好的重要条件之一。一年来，许多干部克服了各种困难，做到了经常到课率在百分之九十以上，就是由于有了自觉的学习情绪作为保证。
    一年来，夜大学虽然获得了若干成绩与经验，但是它的缺点还是很多的。现正在根据过去的教训，研究在某些方面作进一步的改善，特别对理论与实践如何更密切地结合问题，更给予了应有的注意。现在除在教学工作中准备解决这一问题外，并在教育内容上加以研究，把毛主席的“实践论”，当作哲学一课的主要内容。夜大学毕业后，再行筹组以研究毛泽东著作为主的更高级的学习组织，以便更好地使干部运用理论来指导自己的实践。
