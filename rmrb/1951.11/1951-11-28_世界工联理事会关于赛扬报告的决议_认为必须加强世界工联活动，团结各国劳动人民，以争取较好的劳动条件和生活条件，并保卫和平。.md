Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 27th: According to TASS, the General Council meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions in Berlin concluded on the 21st with the adoption of a resolution on the report by WFTU General Secretary Louis Saillant on "The Work of the WFTU." The resolution first pointed out that since the WFTU's Second Congress in June 1949, the important work carried out by the WFTU Executive Bureau and Executive Committee has strengthened the struggle of working people to improve their economic and social conditions and defend peace. However, the imperialist camp, headed by the United States, is actively preparing for another world war. The imperialist policy of war preparation has caused serious disasters to working people in capitalist countries, colonies, semi-colonies, and dependent countries. At the same time, the trade union scabs of the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" continue to use all their strength to split the trade union movement and weaken the working class's resistance to monopoly capitalists. Therefore, under these circumstances, the WFTU General Council believes it is necessary to strengthen the WFTU's activities, to unite the working people of all countries more closely, regardless of political or religious beliefs and trade union affiliations, in order to strive for better working and living conditions and to defend peace.

The resolution continued: At present, the most important tasks of the WFTU are: to strengthen the struggle of working people to realize their vital demands based on broader united action of working people; to more effectively support trade union organizations and national liberation movements in colonies, semi-colonies, and dependent countries; to unite all working people to defend peace; and to unremittingly expose the conspiracies of imperialists and their agents to deceive the people of all countries, to spread hatred and strife among them, in order to drag them into a new war.

In order to accomplish these tasks, the WFTU General Council recommends that all WFTU executive bodies, trade union internationals, and national trade unions take the following actions:

(1) Expand, by all means, the international movement of solidarity with all working people who are struggling to improve their economic and social conditions and with those who are being persecuted.

(2) Pay more attention to defending the demands of working women and youth, assist in and widely participate in the preparatory work for the International Conference for the Defense of the Rights of Youth, and assist in the preparation of the International Conference for the Defense of Children.

(3) Expand the activities of the WFTU Liaison Bureau to strengthen assistance to trade union organizations in Asia, Africa, Latin America, the Near East, and the Middle East. Strive to get the broad masses of workers to join trade unions, consolidate existing trade unions organizationally, and establish trade unions where there are none.

(4) Help the trade union movement in colonies, semi-colonies, and dependent countries, help them train trade union cadres and improve their work among the working people. Prepare regional trade union representative conferences to study issues such as safeguarding the economic and social interests of the working people in these countries, establishing and respecting the legal rights of the working people, and guaranteeing their democratic freedoms and national independence.

(5) Actively support the resolutions of the Second Session of the World Peace Council, participate more vigorously in the signature campaign for a declaration requiring the five major powers to conclude a peace pact, and at the same time carry out propaganda work among the masses.

(6) Systematically support the European Workers' Committee Against the Remilitarization of Germany, support various national movements against the remilitarization of Germany, and establish closer ties with working people of various beliefs and tendencies, thereby expanding the struggle and making it more effective.

(7) Support the struggle of trade unions against the rearmament of Japan and against the establishment of military bases by the United States in the Far East, strengthen the trade union movement to support all measures aimed at ending the Korean War and the Vietnam War, and actively participate in the regional conference of Asian countries' peoples for the defense of peace planned by the World Peace Council.

(8) Begin large-scale propaganda work among all working people to expose the lies, slanders, and aggressive plans of the imperialists and their agents, and to smash the conspiracies of splitters in the workers' movement.

(9) Expand the exchange of delegation activities between working people in capitalist and colonial countries and working people in the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries. Widely publish and disseminate the reports of these delegations among working people in all countries.

(10) Continue to improve the content and distribution of the "World Trade Union Movement" magazine, study the possibility of publishing the magazine in more languages and restoring the WFTU News Bulletin, publish more popular pamphlets on the most important issues of the life and struggle of the working people, and widely publicize the WFTU's programs on economic and social demands through newspapers and radio stations.

The resolution finally emphasized that the Council is confident that trade union organizations will spare no effort to further strengthen the unity of working people to ensure world peace.

    世界工联理事会关于赛扬报告的决议
    认为必须加强世界工联活动，团结各国劳动人民，以争取较好的劳动条件和生活条件，并保卫和平。
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：世界工会联合会理事会柏林会议在二十一日闭幕会议上，就世界工联总书记赛扬的关于“世界工联工作”的报告通过了一项决议。决议首先指出：自从世界工联在一九四九年六月举行第二届代表大会以来，世界工联执行局和执行委员会所进行的各项重要工作，已加强了劳动人民改善经济、社会状况和保卫和平的斗争。但是，以美国为首的帝国主义阵营却积极准备另一次世界大战。帝国主义的备战政策已使资本主义国家、殖民地、半殖民地和附属国劳动人民遭受严重的灾难。同时，“国际自由工会联合会”的工贼们继续用一切力量来分裂工会运动和削弱工人阶级对垄断资本家的反抗。因此，在这种情况下，世界工联理事会认为必须加强世界工联的活动，不分政治、宗教信仰和工会派别，更紧密地团结各国劳动人民，以争取较好的劳动条件和生活条件，并保卫和平。
    决议接着说：目前，世界工联最重要的任务是：在劳动人民更广泛的统一行动的基础上，加强劳动人民为实现他们的切身要求而进行的斗争；更有效地支持殖民地、半殖民地和附属国的工会组织和民族解放运动；团结全体劳动人民以保卫和平；不懈地揭露帝国主义者及其代理人欺骗各国人民、并在各国人民中间散布仇恨和纷争以便把他们卷入新战争的阴谋。
    为了完成这些任务，世界工联理事会建议世界工联各执行机构、各工会国际和各国全国性工会采取以下的行动：
    （一）用一切方法扩大声援一切为改善自己的经济和社会状况而斗争的劳动人民以及遭受迫害的人们的国际运动。
    （二）更多地注意保卫劳动妇女和青年的要求，协助进行并广泛参加关于国际保卫青年权利会议的筹备工作，协助筹备国际保卫儿童会议。
    （三）扩大世界工联联络局的活动，以加强对于亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲、近东、中东等地工会组织的帮助。争取广大劳动群众加入工会，在组织上巩固现有的工会，并在没有工会的地方成立工会。
    （四）帮助殖民地、半殖民地和附属国的工会运动，帮助它们训练工会干部和改进在劳动人民中的工作。筹备区域性的工会代表会议，以研究关于维护这些国家劳动人民的经济和社会利益、确立和尊重劳动人民的法律权利、保证他们的民主自由和民族独立等问题。
    （五）积极支持世界和平理事会第二次会议的决议，更加努力地参加要求五大国缔结和平公约宣言的签名运动，同时在群众中进行宣传工作。
    （六）有计划地支持欧洲工人反对德国重新军国主义化委员会，支持反对德国重新军国主义化的各种民族运动，与各种不同信仰和倾向的劳动人民建立更密切的联系，从而扩大斗争，并使斗争更为有效。
    （七）支持工会反对重新武装日本和反对美国在远东建立军事基地的斗争，加强工会运动以支持一切旨在结束朝鲜战争和越南战争的措施，积极参加世界和平理事会计划召开的亚洲国家人民保卫和平的区域会议。
    （八）开始对全体劳动人民进行大规模的宣传工作，以揭发帝国主义者及其代理人的谎言、诬蔑和侵略计划，粉碎工人运动中分裂分子的阴谋。
    （九）扩大资本主义国家和殖民地国家与苏联和人民民主国家劳动人民之间交换代表团的活动。广泛地出版并在一切国家的劳动人民中间散发这些代表团的报告。
    （十）继续改进“世界工会运动”杂志的内容和发行工作，研究用更多种的语文来出版这个杂志和恢复世界工联新闻公报的可能性，出版更多的关于劳动人民生活和斗争中最重要问题的通俗小册子，通过报刊和广播电台广泛地宣传世界工联关于经济和社会要求的方案。
    决议最后强调说：理事会确信：各工会组织将不遗余力地进一步加强劳动人民的团结，以确保世界和平。
