    The Evil Consequences of Formalism

    The failure of the first anti-Ba Tou struggle and the victory of the second anti-Ba Tou struggle at the Wanshou Road construction site of the Beijing Construction Engineering Company strikingly illustrate that in the anti-Ba Tou struggle, it is essential to truly and deeply mobilize the masses. In the first anti-Ba Tou struggle, leading cadres also convened meetings of activists, but most of these "activists" were small Ba Tou and elements exploited by the Ba Tou. Relying on Ba Tou to oppose Ba Tou, the result is bound to be failure, which is all too obvious.

    Here, we see the evil consequences of formalism. The fake activist meeting convened by the leading cadres of the Wanshou Road construction site, which led to failure, proves that these comrades still do not understand that activists are produced in the struggle of the masses, and leading cadres must go through arduous work to discover and cultivate activists. Thus, they crudely and formalistically found some people, held a meeting, and thought that this was relying on activists, which of course could not solve any problems.

    The cadres of the construction site accepted the lessons of the first failure and adopted the policy of carrying out extensive publicity, enlightening the class consciousness of the masses, and relying on the broad masses to carry out revolutionary struggle, and achieved the victory of the anti-Ba Tou struggle. This is the method of the mass line. Using this method seems to take "more effort" than using that formalistic method, but in order to do a good job in such complex and acute work as the anti-Ba Tou struggle, it is necessary to adopt such a method.

    形式主义的恶果
    北京市建筑工程公司万寿路工地第一次反把头斗争的失败，和第二次反把头斗争的胜利，突出地说明了在反把头斗争中，必须真正深入发动群众。在第一次反把头斗争中，领导干部也召开了积极分子会议，但是这些到会的“积极分子”，大部分是小把头和被把头利用的分子。依靠把头来反把头，其结果必然失败，是再明显不过了。
    在这里，我们看到了形式主义的恶果。万寿路工地的领导干部，召开的那个招致失败结果的假积极分子会议，证明这些同志还不了解积极分子是在群众斗争中产生的，领导干部为了发现与培养积极分子，必须经过艰苦的工作。于是，他们粗枝大叶地、形式主义地找一些人，开一个会，还认为这就是依靠积极分子，这当然不能解决任何问题。
    该工地干部接受了第一次失败的教训，采取了大张旗鼓地进行宣传，启发群众的阶级觉悟，依靠广大群众，进行革命斗争的方针，获得了反把头斗争的胜利。这是群众路线的方法。运用这种方法，比较运用那种形式主义的方法，似乎要“费力”一些，但是，为了把反把头斗争这样复杂尖锐的工作作好，就必须采用这样的方法。
