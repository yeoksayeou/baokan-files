The "1951 Weaving Method," summarized at the National Weaving Method Conference, is a concentrated representation of the various advantages in the operations of outstanding weaving workers in Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, and Northeast China.

This advanced working method has three main characteristics:

The first characteristic is that the work is regular. In the case of ordinary looms, the method of sectional shuttle changing is implemented to make the work more orderly. Shuttle changing is the most important and frequent task when weaving with ordinary looms. Previously, workers changed shuttles without a fixed pattern, and they did not know which loom's weft yarn would run out first. Therefore, when dealing with warp yarn breaks or other tasks, it was even more difficult to grasp the shuttle changing work. As a result, the work was passive, and people were controlled by the machines. The sectional shuttle changing method solves this difficulty. It involves planning the order in which the weft yarn of each loom will run out, adopting sequential shuttle changing or dividing the looms into two sections. This ensures that shuttle changing always follows a certain order, increasing proactive shuttle changes and reducing passive shuttle changes, concentrating spare time to do a good job of inspection and patrol, thereby improving quality, increasing the number of looms a worker can oversee, and reducing labor intensity.

There are three methods of sectional shuttle changing. Among them, the "two-section, four-segment sectional shuttle changing method" is suitable for the conditions of general factories, and therefore should become the main method for promotion at present. The preliminary form of sectional shuttle changing is the "two-section shuttle changing method." For example, in eight looms, every four looms form a large section. The shuttle changing work of the first large section must be completed before the shuttle changing of the second large section, but there is no fixed order for shuttle changing within each large section, which increases the route of repeated walking. Therefore, this form is only suitable for the initial learning stage. The "two-section, four-segment sectional shuttle changing method" involves changing shuttles on looms 1 and 2 first, then looms 3 and 4, and so on to looms 5 and 6 and looms 7 and 8 in eight looms. Every two looms form a small segment, and there is a certain order and priority between segments. Especially between the second and third segments, the interval is slightly longer, which allows for some flexible work. Therefore, it is still divided into two large sections. When workers adopt this method, as long as they pay attention to the order in which the weft yarn of the two looms in a small segment runs out, they can strive for proactive shuttle changing. Therefore, the planning and foresight are stronger, and they can avoid "unnecessary detours." The last method is the "two-section, eight-segment sectional shuttle changing method." Its shuttle changing sequence is often carried out according to the order of the machine number, which makes the focus of attention and planning stronger than the previous two methods. However, the implementation of this method requires a higher reduction in broken ends, machine speed, and uniformity of yarn length, so it is currently only suitable for factories with better conditions. After the implementation of the sectional shuttle changing method, the shuttle changing work can be concentrated in a shorter period. Before the completion of the first shuttle change and before the second shuttle change, workers can inspect the cloth surface in front of the machine and patrol behind the machine, preventing the occurrence of broken ends and defective cloth, and ensuring quality. Patrol work is carried out according to a certain route and a certain period. For the inspection of the cloth surface, the working method stipulates that it should be inspected every time a shuttle is changed; for the inspection of the warp beam, it is also stipulated that the warp beam should be inspected every two shuttle changes. This regular patrol ensures that every inch of cloth and every inch of yarn does not escape the worker's eyes, ensuring the quality of the cloth.

In the case of automatic looms, because the work involves multi-machine operation, there must be a set of patrol rules for managing multiple machines. According to the regulations of the "1951 Weaving Method," the weaver always patrols the loom area constantly according to a certain route. The work in the patrol mainly includes inspecting the cloth surface, warp beam, and handling machine stops. The patrol method is to divide a large patrol into two small patrols. In each large patrol, the cloth surface is inspected twice and the warp beam is inspected once; in each small patrol, the cloth surface of all machines and the warp beam of half of the machines are inspected. Because the cloth surface that can be inspected is twelve inches, and the warp beam that can be inspected is twenty-four inches, the patrol route of two-to-one for cloth surface and warp beam is adopted, which saves time and can promptly discover the shortcomings on the cloth surface and warp beam. With regular patrols, workers can proactively prepare for the work they need to do, thereby reducing defective cloth and improving quality. This is the first characteristic of the "1951 Weaving Method" applied to automatic looms.

The second characteristic is that the work distinguishes between priorities and is flexible, which can reduce downtime and achieve high output and good quality. In the case of ordinary looms, the eyes should always pay attention to the situation of all looms during the patrol, and the speed and route of the patrol can be flexibly changed when a machine stop is discovered. For example, shuttle changing and weft insertion are two connected operations, but when the weft yarn of two machines runs out at the same time in a short period, the weft insertion work can be postponed. If the number of thread joining or cloth removal is large, the easier and less time-consuming tasks should be done first to avoid increasing the stop rate. If a broken end and shuttle change occur at the same time, the shuttle change work needs to be done first to avoid continuous stopping of many looms and increasing the trouble of readjusting the distance between sections.

In the case of automatic looms, as with ordinary looms, if there are more machine stops to handle in a certain patrol, the walking speed needs to be accelerated, and the inspection of the cloth surface and warp beam also needs to be faster. It is even possible to reduce the number of warp beam inspections once in order to strive to take care of the cloth surface patrol cycle in a timely manner so that defective cloth does not escape the line of sight and get rolled into the cloth roller. If there are fewer machine stops to handle or no machine stops in a certain patrol, the cloth surface and warp beam can be carefully inspected, more defective warp yarns can be handled, and these times can be used as much as possible to strive to do the work of inspecting machine parts.

The third characteristic is to master the machine performance and do a good job of inspection. The loom mechanism is complex, and if one warp yarn is cut, the entire machine cannot produce. In order to prevent machine accidents in advance, the working method for ordinary looms specifically stipulates the shift handover system, which facilitates the mutual exchange of production information between the two parties, does a good job of preparatory work, and smoothly carries out production. In terms of mechanical inspection, twelve items that should be paid attention to regularly are also specifically stipulated. In the working method for automatic looms, many specific regulations have also been made. For example, when defective cloth is found when inspecting the cloth surface, the machine should be stopped immediately, and a defective cloth signal牌 should be raised, and then the defective cloth should be inspected; if phenomena such as weft detachment, weft shrinkage, thick weft, or thin spots occur during work, resulting in defective cloth, the weft yarn, shuttle, and three-finger hook should be inspected in time for problems and dealt with in time to prevent the continuous production of defective cloth. The working method also stipulates that the expander, three-finger hook, dragon gate挡, thin spot needle, and heddle frame should be inspected separately during the patrol. When abnormal phenomena are found, adjustments can be made by themselves if possible, and a repair machine牌 should be raised if not possible, preventing the production of defective cloth from a positive aspect.

In addition, the basic operations stipulated in the working method are also relatively time-saving and labor-saving. The working method for ordinary looms stipulates that when throwing the shuttle, the method of quickly pressing the yarn tail on the cloth in front of the weaving opening with the hand is adopted, so that the yarn does not curl in the shuttle mouth, and the yarn tail does not exceed five inches, which can improve the quality of the cloth and reduce waste. The working method for automatic looms has the regulation that scissors should not leave the hand during patrol. The scissors are always held in the right hand (not exposed outside the hand), and they can be used immediately when the scissors are needed to inspect the warp beam or handle the waste threads on the cloth surface. Unlike before, when the scissors were placed in the pocket, taking them out and putting them in wasted time. At the same time, using scissors to cut waste threads is both fast and tidy. When bad warp yarns are found between the drop wire and the heddle wire, and it is necessary to handle the yarn and join the ends, use a hook to pierce the drop wire, and then break the bad yarn and replace it with the joint yarn, so that the machine does not have to stop.

    “一九五一织布工作法”介绍
    全国织布工作法会议总结出来的“一九五一织布工作法”，是天津、青岛、上海、东北等地区优秀织布工人操作中的各种优点的集中表现。
    这一先进工作法有三个主要特点：
    第一个特点是，工作有规律。在普通布机方面，是实行分段换梭，使工作更有次序。换梭是用普通布机织布时最重要最频繁的工作。从前工人们换梭没有一定规律，不知道那一台布机的纬纱先织完，因此，当处理经纱断头或其他工作时，对换梭工作就更难掌握，结果工作被动，人被机器支配。分段换梭法解决了这个困难。它是有计划地布置各台布机纬纱用完的次序，采用顺次换梭或分成两区进行，使换梭经常有一定的次序，增加主动换梭，减少被动换梭，集中空余时间，做好检查巡回工作，从而提高质量，增加工人看台能力，减轻了劳动强度。
    分段换梭的方法有三种，其中“两段四节分段换梭法”适合于一般工厂的情况，因此应成为目前推广的主要方法。分段换梭法的初步形式是“两段换梭法”，如在八台布机中，每四台为一大段，第一大段的换梭工作要在第二大段换梭前全部完成，但每一大段内换梭无一定次序，使反复行走的路线增加，因此这种形式只适合于开始学习的阶段。“两段四节分段换梭法”是在八台布机中，第一、二号机换梭完毕后，换三、四号两机，依次至五、六和七、八号机。以每两机为一小节，小节间有一定次序与先后，特别是在第二、三小节间，间隔时间稍长，可以做些机动性的工作。所以仍分为两大段。工人们采用这种方法时，只要注意小节中两个布机纬纱用完的前后，就能争取主动换梭，因此计划性，预见性较强，而且可以不走“冤枉路”。最后一种是“两段八节分段换梭法”。它的换梭顺序经常依照车号次序进行，使注意力集中，计划性较前两种方法都强。但实行这一方法，对断头率的减少、机械速度和纾纱长度的均匀要求较高，所以目前只适合在条件较好的工厂实行。实行分段换梭法后，可把换梭的工作集中在较短的时间里进行。在第一次换梭完毕第二次换梭前，工人能够在机前检查布面和车后巡回，防止了断头和次布的产生，保证了质量。巡回工作是按照一定路线、一定周期进行的。对于布面的检查，工作法中规定每进行一次换梭就检查一次；对于经轴的检查，也规定每进行两次换梭就检查一周经轴。这种有规律的巡回，使每吋布和每吋纱都不致漏过工人的眼睛，保证了布的质量。
    在自动布机方面，由于工作是多机台操作，就必须要有一套管理多机台的巡回规律。按照“一九五一织布工作法”的规定，当车工总是按照一定路线不断地在车档内巡回。巡回中的工作，主要是检查布面、经轴和处理停台。巡回的方法是一个大巡回中分成两个小巡回，每次大巡回中检查两次布面和一次经轴；每一小巡回中检查全部台数的布面和半数机台的经轴。因为布面能检查到的是十二吋，经轴能检查到的是二十四吋，所以采用布面与经轴二比一的巡回路线，既节省时间又能及时发现布面和经轴上的缺点。巡回有了规律，工人就能主动地准备自己所要做的工作，从而减少次布，提高品质。这就是“一九五一织布工作法”应用在自动布机的第一个特点。
    第二个特点是，工作分清轻重缓急，机动灵活，可以减少停台，达到产量高、质量好的目的。在普通布机方面，巡回中眼睛要随时注意全部布机情况，至于巡回的速度和路线都可以在发现停台时机动变更。如换梭、装纬是两个相连的操作，但在短时间内两机纬纱同时用完时，就可以把装纬工作移后处理。如接头或拆布的次数很多，就应该先做容易的、费时间少的，避免停台率的增加。如果断头和换梭同时发生，就需要先做换梭工作，以免连续停下很多布机，并且增加了重行调节各段间距离的麻烦。
    在自动布机方面，与普通布机一样，如某次巡回中处理停台较多，行走速度就需要加快，检验布面和经轴也要快一些，甚至可以少验一次经轴，争取能及时的照顾到布面巡回的周期，使次布不致逃过视线而卷入卷布棍去。如某一次巡回中，处理停台较少或者没有停台时，可以仔细检验布面和经轴，多处理一些不良的经纱，并尽量利用这些时间来争取做检查机件的工作。
    第三个特点是，掌握机器性能，做好检查工作。布机机构复杂，一根经纱切断全机便不能生产。为了预先防止机器发生事故，在普通布机工作法中，具体地规定了交接班制度，使双方便于互相交换生产情况，做好事前的准备工作，顺利地进行生产。在机械的检查方面，也具体地规定了十二项经常注意的事项。在自动布机工作法中，也做了多项具体规定。如检查布面时发现次布，应立刻停车，竖起拆布信号牌，然后检查次布；如工作中发生脱纬、纬缩、粗纬、稀弄等现象造成次布时，应及时检查纬纱、梭子、三指钩等有无毛病，及时加以处理，防止连续产生次布。工作法中同时规定在巡回中应分别地检查伸幅器、三指钩、龙门档、稀弄针、综框等机件，发现不正常现象时，能调整的就自己调整，不能的就竖起修机牌，从积极方面防止产生次布。
    此外，工作法中规定的基本操作也比较省时省力。普通布机工作法中规定投梭时采用迅速用手压纱尾在织口前布上的方法，使纱在梭口内不卷曲，纱尾又不长过五吋，既可改善布的品质又可以减少浪费。自动布机工作法中有巡回时剪刀不离手的规定。剪刀总是握在右手（不露出手外），在检验经轴或处理布面回丝需要用剪刀时，就可即时使用。不像以前把剪刀放在口袋里，拿出放进，浪费时间，同时用剪刀剪回丝，既快又整齐。在落片和综丝之间发现不良经纱，需要理纱接头时，用钩子穿住落片，再搞断不良纱条换上接头纱，使车子不必停下。（新华社）（附图片）
