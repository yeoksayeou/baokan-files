    North China Materials Exchange Exhibition Closes
    Strengthened Ties Between Urban and Rural People Economically and Ideologically
    Pointed Out Specific Directions for Improvement in Industrial and Agricultural Production
    [By Our Newspaper] The North China Urban-Rural Materials Exchange Exhibition closed at 6:00 PM on the 20th.

    After eighty days of preparation and forty-five days of exhibition and trading, the conference achieved great success in all aspects. Over 13,000 exhibits were displayed, and the audience reached one million people. The conference warmly received people from all walks of life, including over 40,000 farmer representatives, county heads and commissioners from North China, and international friends. In addition to Tibet and Xinjiang, 103 trade delegations participated in the transactions. Under the organization and leadership of the Material Exchange Committee of the conference, the delegations conducted large-scale material exchanges in a planned manner. The estimated total transaction value reached 15,600 billion yuan, setting the highest transaction record for material exchange exhibitions across the country.

    The Conference Strengthened Urban-Rural
        Mutual Assistance Economically and Consolidated the Worker-Peasant Alliance

    The conference organized a nationwide urban-rural material exchange, strengthening urban-rural mutual assistance economically and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. Of the 15,600 billion yuan in transactions, purchases from North China and Inner Mongolia accounted for 66.14 percent, and sales accounted for 84.3 percent; purchases from other major administrative regions accounted for 33.86 percent, and sales accounted for 15.7 percent. In the total transaction value, spot contracts accounted for 68.32 percent, and agreements accounted for 31.68 percent. Sales were mainly of native and special products, accounting for more than 60 percent of the total value. The conference also found sales channels for slow-selling goods, selling over 70 billion yuan worth of such goods. For example, the unsold medicinal materials such as Scutellaria baicalensis and Anemarrhena asphodeloides, which had been stored in Hebei for more than five years, were sold this time. The majority of native and special products produced this year in the provinces of North China and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have been sold. The spirit of considering both public and private interests and mutual benefit was implemented in the conference transactions, and transactions were organized according to the different needs of various regions. First, the purchasing requirements of the Northeast Region, the frontier of national defense, were supported. From October 10th to November 10th, the Northeast trade delegation purchased 150 billion yuan worth of daily-use industrial products, accounting for about 56 percent of the total transaction volume in the temporary exchange for daily-use general merchandise during the same period. The conference provided appropriate consideration for regions with concentrated ethnic minorities, disaster areas in North China, and other major administrative regions. Disaster areas in North China received great support through the conference transactions. Incomplete statistics from Chahar and Suiyuan provinces, the two provinces in North China most severely affected by the disaster, showed that the total value of native and special products sold from the disaster areas reached over 130 million jin of millet. The Pingyuan province sold three main handicraft products produced by disaster victims—homespun cloth, straw hat braids, and pockets—which could yield a profit of 20 million jin of millet.

    In addition, through the conference transactions, various regions purchased large quantities of industrial products needed for farmers' production and lives to meet the increasing demands of farmers (especially those in economic crop areas) for means of production and means of subsistence.

    The Conference Played a Significant Role
        in Improving Industrial and Agricultural Production

    The conference's transactions and exhibitions pointed out the direction for improving industrial and agricultural production, made workers and farmers aware of the importance of improving technology, and made industrialists and businessmen aware of the need to face the countryside. In industry, the conference exhibited more than 70 cases of workers' inventions and technological improvements, introduced the advanced experiences of many labor models, and pointed out the direction of relying on the working class to establish a scientific management system on the basis of democratic management and implementing economic accounting. In agriculture, it introduced the new production records of labor models such as Li Shunda and Qu Yaoli in Shanxi, Zhang Xishun and Ma Guorong in Hebei, Yang Jianshan in Pingyuan, Dang Xingxian in Suiyuan, and Lin Sangma in Inner Mongolia, and systematically introduced the policies and methods of organizing mutual aid and cooperation, increasing yield per unit area, promoting improved varieties, preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, closing hillsides for afforestation, developing livestock, and developing local and special products. The conference's exhibits specifically pointed out the direction of progress in industry and agriculture, pointed out the direction of combining diligence and technological improvement, combining production and patriotism, combining scientific theory and technology with the practice of the masses, and combining individual and collective mutual aid and cooperation, changing the "suffering to death" and the old-fashioned empiricist operating methods and conservative thinking, and providing favorable guarantees for next year's production. In addition, through transactions and exhibitions, the direction of improvement for industry and commerce was pointed out, which must be to actively produce the means of production and livelihood necessary for the countryside, improve business methods, eliminate the bad habits of speculation and opportunism, strive for high quality, low prices, suitability, and durability, and ensure timely supply.

    In the transactions, the planarity of production and sales was greatly strengthened through contract forms. The sales channels, prices, specifications of many products, as well as the output, production period, quantity, and sales channels of various local and special products in the North China region, were basically grasped. This provided a more correct basis for guiding and improving the production of local and special products, and can avoid blindness.

    During the conference, Tianjin workers and farmer representatives from various regions held multiple gatherings, introducing their production situations and understanding each other's production requirements. Farmer delegations from various regions also held symposiums with industrialists and businessmen in Tianjin, and the farmer representatives put forward opinions on improving industrial products based on the requirements of developing agricultural production and improving living standards. These activities directly promoted the ideological, emotional, and productive connections between urban and rural people in the North China region.

    The Conference Was a Vivid and Concrete
        Textbook on Patriotism

    The conference conducted vivid and concrete patriotic education for people from all walks of life in urban and rural areas. The conference was large in scale and rich in content, allowing the audience to truly recognize the vastness of the motherland and the abundance of resources, recognize the achievements of implementing various economic policies of the New Democracy in the North China region over the past two years, and recognize the superiority of the New Democratic social system, thereby seeing the bright and beautiful prospects of the motherland's future, and increasing their high enthusiasm for loving the motherland and their infinite confidence in defeating American imperialism. After visiting and holding various forms of symposiums and get-togethers, many workers, farmers, and industrialists and businessmen revised their patriotic production increase and savings plans, and cotton farmers also expressed their intention to sell all their cotton to the state. A labor model from a military family in Shanxi wrote to his son on the Korean front after the visit, encouraging him to become a combat hero and defend the motherland. People from all walks of life further recognized the infinite wisdom and creative power of the Chinese working people, especially the working class, at this exhibition. Farmer representatives also strengthened the idea of the worker-peasant alliance through visits, get-togethers, and symposiums.

    The Conference Is Undergoing Various Closing Tasks
      The Original Site of the Exhibition Will Be Established as a Museum

    The Working Committee of the North China Urban-Rural Materials Exchange Exhibition held its last plenary committee meeting on the afternoon of the 20th, announcing that the conference would end on the 20th of this month, and discussed the conference's work summary and various closing tasks; the following decisions were made on several specific issues in the closing work:

    1. All remaining properties such as conference houses and utensils will be transferred to the Tianjin Municipal People's Government to show gratitude to the people of Tianjin.

    2. With the consent of relevant provinces and cities, most of the conference exhibits will be transferred to the North China Affairs Department for the establishment of a museum for continued visits and learning by people from all walks of life. The museum will be located at the original site of the conference in Tianjin and will be managed by the Tianjin Municipal People's Government on behalf of the department.

    3. The conference decided to award certificates of merit for special creations and inventions and outstanding labor model deeds among the exhibits.

    4. The conference decided to reward model and general staff members in the conference work according to different circumstances. Souvenirs will be given to the five provinces and two cities in North China, relevant departments, and Tianjin citizens who warmly received the farmers to thank them for their support and assistance to the conference.

    华北物资交流展览会闭幕
    从经济上思想上加强了城乡人民的联系
    为工农业生产指出了具体的改进的方向
    【本报讯】华北区城乡物资交流展览会，已于二十日下午六时闭幕。
    这次大会经过八十天的筹备，四十五天的出展和交易，各方面都有巨大成就。展出一万三千多种展览品，观众达百万人。大会热忱地招待了各界人士，其中农民代表、华北区的县长专员和国际友人共占四万之多。参加交易的除西藏、新疆以外，共有一百零三个贸易代表团。各代表团在大会物资交流委员会的组织和领导下，有计划地进行了大规模的物资交流。估计成交总值达一万五千六百多亿元，创全国各地物资交流展览会交易额的最高纪录。
    大会从经济上加强了城乡
        互助，巩固了工农联盟
    大会组织了全国性的城乡物资交流，从经济上加强了城乡互助，巩固了工农联盟。在一万五千余亿的成交中，华北及内蒙采购占百分之六十六点一四，推销占百分之八十四点三；其他各大行政区采购占百分之三十三点八六，推销占百分之十五点七。成交总值中，现货合同占百分之六十八点三二，协议占百分之三十一点六八。推销中以土产特产为主，占总值的百分之六十以上；并为滞销品找到销路，计共销出滞销品七百多亿。如河北存了五年多的黄岑、知母等滞销药材，这次也已销出。今年华北各省和内蒙古自治区出产的土产特产，已销出了绝大部分。大会交易中，贯彻了公私兼顾互惠两利的精神，按照各地不同的需要组织交易。首先支持了国防前卫地区东北区的购货要求。东北贸易团从十月十日到十一月十日，购进总值一千五百亿元的日用工业品，约占同一时期内大会日用百货临时交易所内成交总额的百分之五十六。大会对少数民族聚集的区域、华北的灾区及其他大行政区都进行了适当的照顾。华北的灾区，通过大会交易，得到了很大支持。仅以华北灾情最重的察哈尔、绥远两省不完全的统计，推销灾区土产特产总值达一亿三千余万斤小米；平原省推销灾民的土布、草帽辫、口袋三种主要手工业品，可获利两千万斤小米。
    此外，通过大会交易，各地都购到了大批的为农民生产和生活所需要的工业品，以适应农民（特别是经济作物地区的农民）日益增涨的对生产资料、生活资料的要求。
      大会对于改进工业农业生产
        起了重大的作用
    大会的交易和展出，给工农业生产指出了改进的方向，使工人、农民认识了改进技术的重要，使工商业家认识了面向农村的必要。在工业上，大会共展出了七十余种工人阶级的创造发明和技术改进的事迹，介绍了许多劳动模范的先进经验，并指出了依靠工人阶级在民主管理基础上建立科学管理制度，和贯彻经济核算制的方向。在农业上，介绍了山西李顺达、曲耀离，河北张希顺、马国荣，平原杨建山，绥远党行先，内蒙林桑玛等劳动模范的生产新纪录，并系统地介绍了组织互助合作、提高单位面积产量、推广优良品种、防治病虫害，封山育林、发展牲畜、发展土副特产的政策和办法。大会的展览品具体地指出了工农业的前进方向，指出了勤劳和提高技术相结合、生产与爱国主义相结合、科学理论技术和群众的实践相结合、个人与大家互助合作的方向，改变了“死受苦”和老一套的经验主义的操作方法和保守思想，为来年的生产提供了有利的保证。此外，通过交易及出展，指出了工商业改进的方向，必须是面向农村积极生产农村所必需的生产生活资料，改进经营方法，革除投机取巧的陋规恶习，力求物美价廉合适耐用，并供应及时。
    在成交中，通过合同形式，大大加强了产销的计划性。很多产品的销路、价格、规格以及华北区各种土产特产的产量、产期、数量及销路等情况，基本上得以掌握。这使指导和改进土产副产特产品的生产有了比较正确的依据，可以避免盲目性。
    大会期间，天津工人和各地农民代表们举行了多次集会，相互介绍了生产情况，了解了彼此生产上的要求。各地农民代表团又和天津市工商业者举行了座谈会，农民代表根据发展农业生产和改善生活的要求，提出了改进工业生产品的意见。这些活动，都直接促进了华北区城乡人民间思想、感情上和生产上的联系。
      大会是爱国主义的生动具体
        的活教材
    大会对于城乡各界人民，进行了生动具体的爱国主义教育。大会规模宏大，内容丰富，使观众真正认识了祖国的地大物博，认识了华北区两年来执行新民主主义的各项经济政策的成就，认识了新民主主义的社会制度的优越性，从而看到了祖国未来的光明美好的远景，增加了爱祖国的高度热情和战胜美国帝国主义的无限信心。许多工人、农民及工商业者经过参观及举行各种形式的座谈会、联欢会，回去后修订了爱国增产节约的计划，棉农们并表示把棉花全部卖给国家。山西一位军属劳动模范，参观后给在朝鲜前线的儿子写信，鼓励他作战斗英雄，保卫祖国。各界人民并在这次展览会上进一步认识了中国劳动人民，特别是工人阶级的无限的智慧和创造力量。农民代表并经过参观和联欢会、座谈会加强了工农联盟的思想。
