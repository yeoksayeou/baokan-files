　　China National Cereals Corporation Affiliated Branches Improve Business Management
    Saving Over 150 Billion Yuan in Circulation Costs in Half a Year
    In the first half of this year, the affiliated branches of the China National Cereals Corporation actively improved business management and saved on commodity circulation costs. According to statistics from the Southwest, Central South, East China, Northwest, and North China regions' grain companies, commodity circulation costs alone decreased by 3.01% compared to the original plan in the first half of this year, saving approximately 154.8 billion yuan.
    Local grain companies have begun to attach importance to saving grain storage costs. In the first half of the year, 1.3 billion jin of damp grain were sun-dried, saving 29.6 billion yuan in storage costs. Improving grain depot stacking methods and saving various packaging costs accounted for a significant proportion of this. The number of sacks used per 10,000 jin of grain decreased by an average of 18 compared to last year in the first half of this year, and the number of sleepers used per 10,000 jin of grain decreased by one compared to last year. These costs alone saved 24.4 billion yuan. This year, when local grain companies promoted Northeast grain, they adhered to the following principles: grain with a moisture content above 17% should be sold quickly; grain with a moisture content between 15% and 17% should be dried; grain with a moisture content between 13% and 15% should be stacked in ventilated stacks and does not need to be turned. Following this principle saved a lot of drying costs. Tianjin alone saved 1.65 billion yuan. The Shanghai Grain Corporation invented a greenhouse drying method this year, saving approximately 1.6 billion yuan in drying costs per 100 million jin of grain. After local grain companies improved grain storage methods, grain loss greatly reduced. In the first half of this year, grain loss decreased by 0.38% compared to the second half of last year, equivalent to approximately 32.6 billion yuan.
    Local grain companies mostly adjusted transportation routes, improved packaging and escort methods, saving 100.1 billion yuan in transportation costs. Transportation accidents have greatly reduced. In the first half of this year, transportation accidents in the Shanghai Grain Corporation decreased by 99% compared to last year; the accident loss rate of the Southwest region's grain company decreased by 81% compared to last year. As a result of adjusting transportation routes and strengthening transportation plans, a lot of freight was saved. The Pingyuan Province Grain Company used return trips to transport grain, saving approximately 37 million yuan in freight. The Southwest region adopted the method of reciprocal allocation and transfer, saving 1.1 billion yuan in freight.
    Local grain companies also attached importance to accelerating capital turnover and strengthening business management. When the China National Cereals Corporation allocated funds to lower-level units, it implemented a method of allocating funds less frequently but more often. When lower-level companies requested funds from higher-level companies, they implemented a method of requesting funds frequently but in smaller amounts. Local grain companies have begun to determine inventory quotas to accelerate capital turnover. In the first half of this year, the average capital turnover for local grain companies took 168 days, which is 30 days shorter than the 198 days required for capital turnover in the second half of last year. In the second half of last year, the average daily cash inventory of local grain companies accounted for 55.36% of the amount released, which has been reduced to 30.56% in the first half of this year, a decrease of 24.8%. Last year, the East China region company had a large inventory, averaging about ten days of fund backlog. In the first half of this year, the average backlog was three to five days. Accidental losses and other operating expenses of local grain companies have also been greatly reduced, decreasing by 2.12% in the first half of this year compared to the second half of last year, reducing expenses by approximately 170.2 billion yuan.
    Local grain companies have also made significant improvements in operating methods and operating styles, thereby expanding sales revenue, reducing transfer costs, saving expenses, and improving labor efficiency. When processing, local grain companies strive to reduce consumption and increase the flour or rice yield to save national wealth.

　　中国粮食公司所属分支公司改善经营管理
    半年节省流转费用一千五百余亿元
    中国粮食公司各地分支公司，在今年上半年，积极改善经营管理，节约商品流转费用。根据西南、中南、华东、西北和华北各区粮食公司统计，今年上半年仅商品流转费用，即较原计划降低百分之三·○一，节省开支约一千五百四十八亿元。
    各地粮食公司已开始重视节省粮食保管费用。上半年各地翻晒潮粮十三亿斤，节省保管费二百九十六亿元，其中改善粮库囤垛方法，节省各种包装费用，占了很大比重。每万斤粮食使用麻袋数，今年上半年较去年平均减少十八条，使用枕木数，每万斤粮食较去年减少一根，仅这项费用，即节省二百四十四亿元。今年各地粮食公司推销东北粮食时，都掌握了下列原则：粮食水分在百分之十七以上者，迅速出售；在百分之十五至百分之十七者，进行晾晒；在百分之十三以上、百分之十五以下者，垛成通风垛，不必翻晒。贯彻这一原则后，节省了许多翻晒费。仅天津一地，即节省十六亿五千万元。上海市粮食公司今年发明了温室摊燥法，每亿斤粮食节省翻晒费约十六亿元。各地粮食公司改进粮食保管方法后，粮食损耗大大减少。今年上半年粮食损耗量较去年下半年降低百分之○·三八，约合人民币三百二十六亿元。
    各地粮食公司大都调整了运输路线，改善了包装押运方法，节省运费一千零一亿元。运输事故已大大减少。上海市粮食公司今年上半年发生的运输事故，较去年减少百分之九十九；西南区粮食公司事故损失率，较去年减低百分之八十一。由于调整了运输路线，加强了运输计划，结果节省了很多运费。平原省粮食公司利用回空车运粮，节省运费三千七百万元左右。西南区采取兑拨调运方法，节省运费十一亿元。
    各地粮食公司同时重视了加速资金周转、加强经营管理工作。中国粮食公司在给下级拨款时，实行少拨勤拨的办法，下级公司向上级公司要款时，实行勤要少要的办法。各地粮食公司已开始确定库存定额，以加速资金周转。今年上半年各地粮食公司资金平均周转一次需一百六十八天，较去年下半年资金周转一次需一百九十八天，缩短了三十天。去年下半年，各地粮食公司每日现金库存额平均占投放额的百分之五五·三六，今年上半年已减至百分之三○·五六，降低了百分之二四·八。去年华东区公司库存额很大，平均积压资金十天左右，今年上半年平均积压三天至五天。各地粮食公司的意外损失及其他营业开支也大大减少，今年上半年较去年下半年降低了百分之二·一二，减少开支约一千七百零二亿元。
    各地粮食公司在经营方法与经营作风上，也有显著改进，从而扩大了卖钱额，减少了调运费，节约了开支，提高了劳动效率。各地粮食公司加工时，尽力减少耗损，提高出面或出米率，以节约国家财富。
