Xinhua News Agency, 23rd dispatch: In the past two months, significant achievements have been made in promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method in state-owned and private cotton textile factories in Shanghai, Qingdao, Tianjin, Wuhan, and Northeast, Northwest, and Southwest China. The cotton waste rate of roller gins has generally been reduced by about fifty percent. In Qingdao State-owned Cotton Textile Factory No. 6, fifty-six female spinning workers have successively broken Hao Jianxiu's record of low cotton waste from roller gins. The average cotton waste rate of female worker Li Xiufen in August and September has dropped to 0.102, and the lowest was 0.025, which is half of Hao Jianxiu's cotton waste rate.

    The reduction in the cotton waste rate directly increased production and added a large amount of wealth to the country. After workers at the Northwest Dihua Yarn Factory learned the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, the 20-count yarn production per spindle per 20 hours increased from 0.867 pounds to 0.907 pounds, creating the highest record since the establishment of the Dihua Yarn Factory. After the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method in the three textile factories in Wafangdian, Yingkou, and Jinzhou in Northeast China, the total yarn production in September was 70 more pieces than in August, equivalent to more than 770 tons of grain.

    After learning the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, the workers felt that the labor intensity was reduced, and they had a better understanding of their work, unlike in the past when they ran around aimlessly in the workshop. Yi Shijuan, a worker at Shanghai State-owned Cotton Textile Factory No. 3, used to walk more than 5,200 steps in two hours, but after learning the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, she only walked 2,380 steps. Due to the reduction in labor intensity, the workers generally improved their tending ability. The tending ability of each worker in the Hao Jianxiu Work Method training class at Wuhan No. 1 Yarn Factory has increased from 120 spindles to 190 spindles. The tending ability of female workers at Pingyuan Chengxing Yarn Factory has increased from 200 spindles to 384 spindles. In the Hao Jianxiu Work Method training class held by Nantong Dasheng No. 1 Factory, the number of people tending 300 spindles has increased from six to twenty-eight.

    At present, the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method has begun to expand to other departments of cotton textile factories. The steel wire, drawing frame, and cone winding workshops and weaving departments of Qingdao's cotton textile factories have successively learned the basic spirit of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method to improve their work. After the workers in the steel wire workshop of Qingdao Private Huaxin Yarn Factory learned the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, the waste rate was reduced by 50 percent. The cone winding workshop of Qingdao State-owned Cotton Textile Factory No. 3 also saved nearly 200 pounds of waste silk per month due to learning the Hao Jianxiu Work Method.

    各地推广郝建秀工作法已有很大成绩
    皮辊花率一般降低了百分之五十左右
    【新华社二十三日讯】两个月来，上海、青岛、天津、武汉和东北、西北、西南等地公私营棉纺织厂推广郝建秀工作法有很大成绩，皮辊花率一般都降低了百分之五十左右。青岛国营棉纺织六厂已有五十六个细纱女工先后突破了郝建秀少出皮辊花的纪录。女工李秀芬八、九两月份的皮辊花平均率已降到零点一零二，最低时为零点零二五，比郝建秀的皮辊花率还少一半。
    皮辊花率的降低，直接增加了产量，为国家增加了大量的财富。西北大华纱厂工人学习郝建秀工作法后，二十支纱二十小时每锭产量由零点八六七磅增加到零点九零七磅，创造了大华纱厂建厂以来的最高纪录。东北瓦房店、营口、金州三个纺织厂推广郝建秀工作法后，九月份比八月份共多产了七十件纱，折合粮食七百七十多吨。
    在学会郝建秀工作法后，工人们都感到劳动强度降低了，工作时心中有数，不像过去那样在车档里乱跑了。上海国营第三棉纺织厂工人裔式娟过去两小时走五千二百多步，学了郝建秀工作法后只走二千三百八十步。由于劳动强度降低，工人们普遍提高了看台能力。武汉第一纱厂郝建秀工作法学习班每个工人的看台能力，已由看一百二十锭增加到看一百九十锭。平原成兴纱厂女工的看台能力，由看二百锭增加到看三百八十四锭。南通大生一厂举办的郝建秀工作法学习班中看三百锭的人数已由六人增加到二十八人。
    目前郝建秀工作法的推广工作，已开始扩展到棉纺织厂的其他部门。青岛各棉纺织厂的钢丝、并条、筒子等车间和织布部门都纷纷学习郝建秀工作法的基本精神，来改进工作。青岛私营华新纱厂钢丝间工人学习郝建秀工作法后，回花率降低了百分之五十。青岛国营第三棉纺织厂筒子间也因学习郝建秀工作法，每月节省的回丝将近二百磅。
