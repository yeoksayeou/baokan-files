The September 3rd Society's Congratulatory Telegram to Marshal Stalin:

    On the occasion of the 34th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution of your country, the Society extends its heartfelt congratulations to you and the Soviet people with boundless excitement and gratitude.
    The victory of the October Socialist Revolution not only marked the liberation of the Soviet people, but also indicated a bright and splendid future for the liberation cause of the people of the world. Under the victorious banner of Marxism-Leninism, and under the call and encouragement of the great teacher and helmsman – you, the people of the world are fighting with full confidence for the sacred cause of peace, democracy, and socialism. We deeply realize that because of the strength of the Soviet Union, because of the immortal friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, and because of the close unity between the Soviet Union and the working people of the world, our strength is invincible. Our just struggle will surely be victorious.
    We, the Chinese people, should stand even more firmly on the side of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, launch the campaign to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, crush the aggressive plans of the imperialist warmongers, and strive for the lasting peace and happiness of all mankind to celebrate this great anniversary of the October Revolution.
    Chairman of the September 3rd Society, Xu Deheng
