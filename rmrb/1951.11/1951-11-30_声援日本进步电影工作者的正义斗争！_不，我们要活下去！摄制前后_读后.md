    Voice support for the just struggle of Japanese progressive film workers!
     ——After reading “'No, We Want to Live!' Before and After Filming”
    To the Editors: After reading the article "'No, We Want to Live!' Before and After Filming" published in the People's Daily on November 18th, we express our boundless indignation at the barbaric behavior of U.S. imperialism and its puppet Yoshida government in destroying the Japanese people's film industry.
    The Japanese people, like our Chinese people, deeply love peace. They resolutely oppose using film as a tool for war propaganda, and therefore, they pooled funds from all sources to produce this film. While screening their own film, they also convened a Peace Defense Conference and mobilized the masses to sign in support of the Five-Power Peace Pact.
    No matter how bloody the suppression the U.S. occupation authorities inflict on the Japanese people, dispatching troops to besiege Japanese film enterprises, disbanding trade union organizations, and expelling progressive film workers, they will also meet with shameful defeat in the face of the peace-loving Japanese people. We firmly support the just struggle of the Japanese people and Japanese progressive film workers, and strive to defend peace in all of Asia and the world!

    To the Editors: "'No, We Want to Live!' Before and After Filming" is not only a good communication, but also fully illustrates the spirit of the Japanese people fighting for peace. Currently, the struggle against arming Japan is also vigorously unfolding within Japan. This struggle is a serious blow to U.S. imperialism and a major contribution to the cause of world peace.
    The Japanese people and progressive film workers, breaking through various obstacles from the reactionary authorities and overcoming material difficulties, have made a contribution to the cause of peace by producing the film "No, We Want to Live!" I would like to extend my sincerest greetings to these heroic peace fighters and forever support their just struggle!

    声援日本进步电影工作者的正义斗争！
     ——“‘不，我们要活下去！’摄制前后”读后
    编辑同志：读了人民日报十一月十八日刊载的“‘不，我们要活下去！’摄制前后”一文后，我们对美帝国主义及其傀儡吉田政府摧残日本人民电影事业的野蛮行为，表示无限愤慨。
    日本人民与我们中国人民一样地热爱着和平。他们坚决反对将电影作为战争的宣传工具，因而他们从各方面凑集资金，制成这部电影。在放映自己的电影时，还召开了保卫和平大会，发动人民群众签名拥护缔结五大国和平公约。
    不管美国占领当局对日本人民施行如何血腥的镇压，派遣军队围攻日本的电影企业，解散工会组织，驱逐进步电影工作者，但在爱好和平的日本人民面前，也同样遭到了可耻的失败。我们坚决声援日本人民和日本进步电影工作者的正义斗争，为保卫全亚洲和全世界的和平而奋斗！

    编辑同志：“‘不，我们要活下去！’摄制前后”不仅是一篇好的通讯，而且充分地说明了日本人民为和平事业而奋斗的精神。目前，反对武装日本的斗争在日本国内也蓬勃地开展着。这个斗争，对美帝国主义是一个严重的打击，对于全世界和平事业是一个重大的贡献。
    日本人民和进步的电影工作者，冲破了反动当局的多方阻挠，克服了物质上的困难，制成的“不，我们要活下去！”的电影，是对和平事业的一个贡献。我谨向这些英勇的和平战士致以最亲切的慰问，并永远地声援他们这一正义的斗争！
