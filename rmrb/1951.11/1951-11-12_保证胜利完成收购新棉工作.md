　　Guarantee the Victorious Completion of New Cotton Procurement Work

　　Editor's Note: In the work of procuring new cotton in various regions, there have been constant discoveries of special agent elements engaging in sabotage; some cotton collection stations have already suffered losses as a result. The Wuji County Industrial Company's cotton ginning factory has not paid enough attention to fire prevention equipment and processing work and should strengthen it immediately. The cotton preservation work methods of the Yuanshi County Supply and Marketing Cooperative are very good and worthy of learning by cotton collection stations and cotton ginning factories in various regions.

　　保证胜利完成收购新棉工作
    编者按：各地在收购新棉工作中，曾不断发现有特务分子进行破坏；有的收棉站已因此而招致了损失。无极县实业公司轧花厂对防火设备和加工工作，注意不够，应即加强。元氏县供销社的保棉工作办法很好，值得各地收棉站和轧花厂学习。
