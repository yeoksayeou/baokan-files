Labor Models Write to Chairman Mao Guaranteeing Increased Production
New Production Records Constantly Emerging in the Fengfeng Mining Area

We are determined to improve technology and continue to work hard to increase production

Respected Chairman Mao: We, all 190 industrial and agricultural labor models in the mining area, held a three-day meeting in the mining area with unparalleled excitement. The meeting was very successful. Not only did it exchange experiences in industrial and agricultural production, but it also came up with production methods for the future. From the speeches, it can be seen that everyone realizes that it is under your and the Communist Party's wise leadership that the working people have gained glory, and that we, who were once looked down upon, have become models today. All the labor models in our mining area extend our sincerest greetings to you.

In the great movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, our mining area has continuously achieved new national records in pneumatic pick coal mining, with Zhao Wenxin mining 243 tons of coal and Luo Yongjin mining 254 tons of coal. In the past ten months, state-owned coal mines alone have saved more than 3 million catties of millet. Among them, the Fourth Mine, driven by the labor models, completed its annual production task ahead of schedule by two and a half months, saving a cost of more than 1.7 million catties of millet.

In agriculture, new records have also emerged, such as Song Fagao's yield of more than 400 catties of cotton per mu and more than 700 catties of corn per mu. Other areas have also achieved great results.

Chairman Mao, we, the industrial labor models of the entire mining area, guarantee to you that we will not only consolidate the existing achievements, but also make greater efforts to strengthen democratic management, improve technology, create higher new records, and complete the production tasks assigned by the state. Under the principle of "safety first," we will increase production, reduce costs, and accumulate more wealth for the country.

We, the agricultural labor models, will learn new scientific production methods, strengthen mutual assistance, prepare well for cotton planting next year, and organize the masses to carry out a cotton selling campaign. We will do our best to increase yield per unit area and ensure a good harvest movement.

We, the handicraft labor models, will gradually improve production methods and strive to start using machines next year to improve efficiency and increase national income.

Respected Chairman Mao: We, all the labor models, guarantee to you that in the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, we will conscientiously implement the patriotic pact, further organize and lead the masses, increase production, increase national defense strength, defeat the aggression of American imperialism, and build our new country peacefully.

Ding County People Organize Themselves to Win a Bumper Harvest and Prepare for Next Year's Patriotic Production Increase

Respected Chairman Mao: This year's crops in our county have been very good. But this year's harvest was achieved by overcoming many difficulties. From the beginning of spring, the weather in our county was dry, and the farmers fought against the drought, so that 1,471,700 mu of cultivated land in the county was sown in time. After sowing, the drought became even more severe, and many crops were also infested with pests. Cotton aphids were particularly severe. In the old society, there would have been no way to deal with these disasters. Now, with the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, we can find solutions, and the working-class brothers and sisters have manufactured waterwheels, pesticides, and sprayers for us, so the county-wide anti-drought and pest control campaign has been launched quickly. Waterwheels and wells are running day and night. The county generally continuously treated cotton aphids three or four times, and Zhang Laozun of Xiangjia Village treated them twelve times. In this way, the pests were eliminated, the drought was overcome, and the "patriotic cotton" and all the crops were protected. In the past, it was rare to pick two or three hundred catties of cotton, but this year it is not uncommon to pick two or three hundred catties. Zhang Yupuo of Xijianyang Village can pick 300 catties of cotton per mu, and Zhang Languo's technical team in Ding Village can produce more than 10,000 catties of yams per mu. Such good harvests were unimaginable in the old society!

This year, we fought against drought and eliminated pests, but we did not delay any of the work of plowing, planting, hoeing, harrowing, and accumulating manure. This is because we listened to your words and organized labor mutual assistance. We newly organized 85 mutual aid teams this year, with 392 peasant households participating. Together with the mutual aid teams organized in previous years, there are a total of 273 teams, with 1,050 peasant households. Many mutual aid teams have also developed into higher-level mutual aid teams. Many patriotic production models have also emerged among women in the county in the patriotic bumper harvest movement. Among us 146 people, 29 are women labor models. Among the 11 labor models who attended the provincial labor model conference, 5 are women.

Chairman Mao! If it were not for your leadership and the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the peasants would not have what they have today, and we farmers would not have become labor models. If it were not for the People's Liberation Army defending the motherland and the Volunteer Army fighting the American aggressors in Korea, we would not have been able to carry out the patriotic bumper harvest competition so peacefully; if it were not for the production support of the working-class brothers and sisters, the 2,704 waterwheels, 507 sprayers, 106,843 catties of pesticides, and various agricultural tools we needed this year would not have been supplied to us so promptly. Therefore, we must actively donate. We have now donated 5,617,000 yuan. In addition, in addition to leaving red flowers for cotton wool this winter, we guarantee to sell and store all the new cotton to the state. At the meeting, we formulated a patriotic production increase pact. At the next meeting, we will report to you on the implementation of the patriotic production increase pact. We must do a good job in autumn plowing, autumn harvest, manure accumulation, and winter production, and lay the foundation for a bumper harvest next year. We guarantee to actively pay the autumn tax, support the front, further consolidate our national defense, and build the motherland better.

We Intensively Cultivate and Increase Grain Production
Guarantee to Continue to Do a Good Job in Production This Winter and Next Spring

Respected Chairman Mao: Since the Chinese People's Liberation Army came to Chengbu County, Hunan Province, in 1949, defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries, and established our own government, the poor peasants of Chengbu have finally seen the light of day. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and through various movements, our awareness has gradually increased. We have made our own efforts in agricultural production, making the production in the past two years a great harvest. This year, in response to the call to resist America and aid Korea and increase production for patriotism, we have worked intensively, applying more fertilizer, so that the county's grain production has increased by more than 3 million catties this year, an increase of 7% compared to last year. The county donated 2 million catties of rice, which is now being given to the state to buy the "Chengbu People's" anti-aircraft gun to fight the American devils. Today, we 57 representatives are honorably elected as agricultural labor models to participate in the first Chengbu County Agricultural Labor Model Conference, and we feel supremely honored. This honor is brought by you. All of us representatives extend our sincere respect to you.

We peasants suffered all kinds of oppression and exploitation under the cruel rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past. However, now the government is our own, and we are helped by the government everywhere. Last year, our county experienced a summer famine, and the People's Government loaned us more than 2 million catties of grain to help us; this year, it also loaned us more than 200,000 catties. We have never grown cotton in the past. This year, the government told us to grow cotton and also loaned us seeds and fertilizers. Now we have harvested snow-white cotton. This July, you also sent your representatives to visit fraternal ethnic groups in our county and gave gifts. We are very grateful. Now we have formulated a production plan for the future and guarantee to do a good job in production this winter and next spring, and respond to your love for us with practical actions.

    劳动模范写信给毛主席保证增加生产
    峰峰矿区不断出现生产新纪录
    我们决提高技术继续努力增产
    敬爱的毛主席：我们全矿区一百九十个工、农业劳动模范以无比兴奋的心情，在矿区开了三天会。大会开得很好，不只交流了工农业生产经验，还想出了今后的生产办法。从发言中可以看出每个人都认识到在您和共产党的英明领导下才有了劳动人民的光荣，才有了我们这些过去被人看不起而今天成为模范的人们。我们全矿区的劳动模范特向您致以最亲切的敬礼。
    我矿区在伟大的抗美援朝运动里，连续出现了赵文信采二四三吨煤，罗永金采二五四吨煤的全国风镐采煤新纪录。十个月来，仅国营煤矿就节余了三百余万斤小米，其中四矿在劳动模范们的带动之下，提前两个半月超额完成了全年生产任务，成本节余一百七十余万斤小米。
    在农业上，也出现了宋法高的每亩产棉花四百余斤和每亩产玉茭七百余斤的新纪录，其他也都获得了很大成绩。
    毛主席，我们全矿区的工业劳动模范向您保证，不仅要巩固已有的成绩，而且要以更大的努力，加强民主管理，提高技术，创造更高的新纪录，完成国家所给予的生产任务。在“安全第一”的原则下提高生产，降低成本，给国家积累更多的财富。
    我们农业劳动模范要学习新的科学的生产方法，加强互助，给明年植棉作好准备，并组织群众开展售棉运动。我们要尽最大努力提高单位面积产量，保证搞好丰产运动。
    我们手工业劳动模范要逐渐改进生产方法，争取明年开始使用机器，提高效率，增加国家收入。
    敬爱的毛主席：我们全体劳动模范向您保证，在抗美援朝运动中认真执行爱国公约，进一步组织与带动群众，提高生产，增加国防力量，打败美帝国主义的侵略，以安然的建设我们的新国家。
    峰峰矿区全体劳动模范定县人民组织起来赢得丰收还要为明年爱国增产作好准备敬爱的毛主席：今年我县的庄稼收成很好。但今年的收成是战胜许多困难才得来的。从开春起，我县天气就旱，农民们就跟旱灾斗争，使全县一百四十七万一千七百余亩耕地及时完成了播种。播种以后天旱的更厉害了，同时不少庄稼还发生了虫害。棉花蚜虫尤其厉害。要是在早先旧社会里，对这些灾害就没法治了，现在有共产党和人民政府领导我们想办法，有工人老大哥给我们制造水车、杀虫药剂和喷雾器等，所以全县抗旱除虫运动很快就开展起来了。水车水井昼夜不停，全县一般都连续除治棉花蚜虫到三、四遍，香家庄张老尊治了十二遍。这样就消灭了虫害，战胜了旱灾，保住了“爱国棉”和一切庄稼。往年棉花摘二、三百斤的可稀少哩，今年摘二、三百斤的已不是少数了。西建阳村张玉璞的棉花每亩能摘三百斤，丁村张兰国技术组的山药每亩能出万余斤，这样好的收成在旧社会里是我们连作梦也想不到的！
    今年又抗旱又除虫，但耕、耩、锄、耪、积肥什么活也没有耽误。这是因为听了你的话，组织了劳动互助的缘故。俺们今年新组织了八十五个互助组，参加的农民达三百九十二户。连往年组织的互助组共有二百七十三个，农民一千零五十户。不少互助组还向高一级的互助组发展。全县妇女在爱国丰产运动中，也出现了不少爱国生产模范。在俺们一百四十六人里头就有二十九个是妇女劳动模范。十一个出席省劳动模范大会的劳动模范中，有五个是妇女。
    毛主席！要是没有您和共产党、人民政府的领导，农民是不会有今天的，俺们这些庄稼人更不会成为劳动模范。要是没有人民解放军捍卫祖国，和志愿军在朝鲜打击美国侵略军，我们也不可能这样安定地开展爱国丰产竞赛；要是没有工人老大哥的生产支持，我们今年所需要的两千七百零四辆水车，五百零七架喷雾器，十万六千八百四十三斤杀虫药以及各种农具，也就不会这样及时地供应给我们。所以我们一定要积极捐献。现在我们已捐了五百六十一万七千元。另外，我们除留下红花作今冬的絮棉外，保证把全部新棉售储给国家。在会上我们制定了爱国增产公约，下次开会时，当向您报告执行爱国增产公约的情形。我们一定要把秋耕秋收、积肥、冬季生产搞好，打下明年丰收的基础。我们保证积极缴纳秋征，支援前线，更加巩固我国国防，把祖国建设得更好。
    定县劳动模范大会全体劳动模范一百四十六人我们精耕细作增产了粮食
    保证继续搞好今冬明春生产敬爱的毛主席：自从一九四九年中国人民解放军来到湖南省城步县，打垮了国民党反动派，建立了我们自己的政府以后，我们城步的穷苦农民才抬头见了青天。在共产党和人民政府的领导下，经过各种运动，我们的觉悟慢慢提高了。我们在农业生产上尽了自己的努力，使二年来的生产得到大丰收。在今年我们响应抗美援朝，爱国增产的号召，作到了精耕细作，多下肥料，使今年全县增产粮食三百多万斤，比去年增产百分之七。全县捐献稻谷达二百万斤，现正交给国家买“城步人民号”高射炮，打美国鬼子。今天我们五十七个代表光荣地当选为农业劳动模范，来参加城步县首届农业劳动模范大会，感到无尚光荣。这种光荣是你带来的，我们全体代表向你致以诚恳的敬礼。
    我们农民过去在国民党反动派的残酷统治下，受尽了压迫与剥削。但是，现在政府是我们自己的了，我们处处受到政府的帮助。去年我县发生夏荒，人民政府就贷了二百多万斤粮食帮助我们；今年也贷了二十多万斤。我们过去都没种棉花，今年政府告诉我们种棉花，还贷了种子和肥料，现在收到了雪白的棉花。今年七月间你又派了你的代表到我们县里访问兄弟民族，还送给礼品，我们都非常感谢。现在我们已订出今后的生产计划，保证搞好今冬明春生产，用实际行动来回答你对我们的热爱。
    湖南城步县首届农业劳动模范大会全体代表
