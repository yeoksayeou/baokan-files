    The Shanxi Provincial Department of Culture and Education-led Peking Opera Troupe Has a Tendency to Become Detached from Politics
    Comrade Editor: The Shanxi Provincial Department of Culture and Education-led rural cultural work team's failure to sing the song "Oppose Armed Japan" has already been severely criticized by readers of the Shanxi Daily (this newspaper's September 27th "Brief Comments on Cultural Life" column also criticized this matter in the article "Newspapers Should Pay Attention to Criticizing Politically Liberal Tendencies" – Editor); however, this issue has still not received sufficient attention from certain responsible comrades of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Culture and Education and artistic groups, to the point that the phenomenon of art becoming detached from politics is still occurring. For example, the Shanxi Provincial Peking Opera Troupe, led by the Department of Culture and Education, amidst the tide of resisting America and aiding Korea, has continuously performed stories such as "Motian Ridge," which depicts the Tang Dynasty's attack on Goryeo (i.e., present-day Korea), as well as old plays containing toxins that promote national scum, such as "Evil Tiger Village," "The Linked Rings," and "Yang Xiangwu Steals the Nine Dragon Cups Three Times." I believe that this tendency of purely seeking profit and becoming detached from politics should be raised to attract the attention of the troupe and the responsible comrades of the Department of Culture and Education.

    山西省文教厅领导的京剧工作团有脱离政治倾向
    编辑同志：山西省文教厅领导的乡村文化工作队不唱“反对武装日本”歌曲一事，已受到山西日报读者们的严厉批评（本报九月二十七日“文化生活简评”栏内“报纸要注意批评政治上自由主义的倾向”一文也对此事提出批评——编者）；但这个问题仍没有引起山西省文教厅某些负责同志和文艺团体的足够的注意，以致文艺脱离政治的现象仍旧发生。像文教厅领导的山西省京剧工作团在抗美援朝的浪潮中，曾不断地演出“摩天岭”等表现唐朝攻打高丽（即今之朝鲜）的故事，以及“恶虎村”、“连环套”、“杨香武三盗九龙杯”等宣扬民族败类的含有毒素的旧剧。我觉得，对这种单纯营利、脱离政治的倾向，应该提出，以引起该团和文教厅负责同志的注意。
