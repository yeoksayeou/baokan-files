Xinhua News Agency, 8th. Amidst the vigorous anti-imperialist struggles of the people in Iran, Egypt, and other Middle Eastern Arab countries, Casablanca, Morocco's largest port, witnessed a powerful demonstration on November 1st by the Moroccan people against French colonial rule.

November 1st was the date the French colonialists had scheduled for the so-called "Moroccan Consultative Council" elections. Prior to the elections, the French colonialists exhausted all means of manipulation, hoping that the Moroccan people would vote in favor of this puppet "public opinion" institution. However, the people of Casablanca replaced voting with demonstrations to express their angry protest against the election. On this day, 7,000 people in Casablanca participated in a massive demonstration. They set up picket lines in the streets and at polling stations, shouting "Down with France!" and "Long Live Morocco!" The enraged demonstrators also engaged in heroic struggles with armed police sent by the colonial authorities to obstruct the demonstration. The French colonial authorities hurriedly mobilized a large number of troops and even tanks for a bloody crackdown, resulting in five deaths, forty injuries, and over five hundred arrests by the military police.

However, the bloody suppression by the French colonialists could not intimidate the Moroccan people. A United Press dispatch from Casablanca on November 3rd acknowledged that while "in this city, roaring tanks and armored vehicles are supporting the army and police to eliminate signs of unrest," "nationalists are distributing leaflets in large quantities. Right under the noses of closely watching police, they are stuffing these leaflets into people's mailboxes, calling on the people to strengthen the movement against French rule, especially against General Guillaume, the French Governor." Leaflets demanding "Down with France" were also distributed in Rabat, the "turbulent Moroccan capital." In places like Khenifra and Khemisset, the Moroccan people also held similar demonstrations.

    在中东各地反帝斗争高涨声中
    摩洛哥人民示威反法
    【新华社八日讯】在伊朗、埃及和中东阿拉伯国家人民反帝斗争蓬勃高涨声中，摩洛哥的最大港口卡萨布兰卡在十一月一日爆发了摩洛哥人民反对法国殖民统治的强大示威。
    十一月一日本来是法国殖民者预定举行所谓“摩洛哥咨议会”选举的日子。在选举以前，法国殖民者用尽了各种操纵把持的手段，希望摩洛哥人民会投票拥护这个御用的“民意”机构，但是，卡萨布兰卡人民却以示威代替了投票，来表示对这次选举的愤怒抗议。这一天，卡萨布兰卡有七千人参加了巨大的示威游行。他们在各街道和投票处都布置了纠察线，他们到处高呼“打倒法国”，“摩洛哥万岁！”激怒了的示威者还和殖民当局派来阻挠示威的武装警察进行了英勇的搏斗。法国殖民当局慌忙调集大批军队甚至坦克车来进行血腥的镇压，结果有五人被军警打死，四十人受伤，五百多人被捕。
    但是，法国殖民主义者的血腥镇压并不能吓倒摩洛哥人民。合众社在十一月三日从卡萨布兰卡发出的电讯承认：现在，虽然“在这个城市里，咆哮着的坦克和装甲车正在支持军队和警察，去消灭骚动的迹象”，但是，“民族主义者在大量散发小册子。他们就在严密监视着的警察的鼻子底下，把这些小册子塞入人家的邮箱里，号召人民加强反对法国统治，尤其是反对法国总督纪尧姆将军的运动”。要求“打倒法国”的小册子也在“动荡不安的摩洛哥首都”拉巴特散发。在凯尼佛拉、坎依那等地方，摩洛哥人民都举行了类似的示威运动。
